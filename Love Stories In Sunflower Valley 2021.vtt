00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.266
[phone ringing]

6
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.767
Hey mom. what's up?

7
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.934
Hi Kate. honey.

8
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.166
I'm just checking.

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.400
Have you run out of
my strawberry jam yet?

10
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.467
Because I'm happy to send more.

11
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.567
I'm still working on the
first two jars you sent me.

12
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.900
but thank you.

13
00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:41.233
So how's your week been?

14
00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:43.000
Well you know. we've
been working on the garden.

15
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.500
You should see your father's
tomatoes. ripe and ready!

16
00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:48.567
Do you think you'll
get any time off soon?

17
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.567
We miss you!

18
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.433
Aww. I miss you.

19
00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:53.500
But there is an outside chance

20
00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:55.033
that I'll be
coming your way soon.

21
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.266
Really?

22
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.533
You know that story I
was telling you about?

23
00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:58.400
Uh huh.

24
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.734
Well. I pitched it to Patricia

25
00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:01.800
and hopefully she'll
let me write it.

26
00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:03.100
which would mean
I would come home

27
00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:04.333
to do the research.

28
00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:06.433
That would be so great. honey.

29
00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.967
Yeah. she texted me
last night that she read it.

30
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.567
She's never read
any of my stories.

31
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.300
let alone taken them seriously.

32
00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:13.834
Oh. that would be amazing.

33
00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:15.567
This might be
your chance to write.

34
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.400
Well good luck.
we'll be thinking of you.

35
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.633
Thanks. mom.

36
00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:20.166
I've gotta go. I'm
almost at the coffee shop.

37
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.266
Hey. you might not be the
office coffee girl much longer!

38
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.133
Call me later. I love you.

39
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.867
I love you. Bye!

40
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.567
Good morning. Kate.

41
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.433
Hi.

42
00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:34.767
My normal order almost ready?

43
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.667
But with a
grande iced mocha for me.

44
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.700
-On the way.
-Great. thank you.

45
00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:41.667
Hi.

46
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.834
I'll have an iced latte

47
00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:45.400
and I see you've
got some pastries here.

48
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.633
Any of them really good
in particular?

49
00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:49.567
You should try the
almond croissants.

50
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.600
They're great.

51
00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:52.500
They're always fresh
out of the oven.

52
00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:55.200
Perfect yeah.
I'll have one of those.

53
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.200
It's a nice coffee shop.

54
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:02.500
It's the best.

55
00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:04.800
I come here every day.

56
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.734
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

57
00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:12.300
-See you next week!
-Have a good day.

58
00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.600
Thanks.

59
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.066
Napkins!

60
00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:19.834
Whoa!

61
00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:22.467
-Oh. I'm so sorry!
-Cold. cold. cold!

62
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.700
Oh. I'm sorry!

63
00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:27.967
No. it's okay. You know what?

64
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.233
-What can I do?
-Nothing.

65
00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:31.800
I'm just glad it was ice.

66
00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:33.734
I feel bad for whoever
lost their coffee.

67
00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:35.033
That was me. but I don't care.

68
00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:36.300
Can I pay for dry cleaning?

69
00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:38.333
No. absolutely not.

70
00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:42.333
But do you know if there are any
clothing stores around here?

71
00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:44.166
Actually yeah.
there's Stanley's.

72
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.400
It's just up on the left.

73
00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:46.834
It's across the street
from the sushi place.

74
00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.000
You know the one with the
bobbing cat in the window?

75
00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:51.300
I don't. but I'm sure
I'll find it.

76
00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:54.133
I work just down the street.
I am late for work.

77
00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:55.567
I am so sorry.

78
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.000
Are you sure
there's nothing I can do?

79
00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:58.000
No. it's just an accident.

80
00:02:58.133 --> 00:02:59.066
You know what?

81
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.467
You be on your way--

82
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.200
I'll see you around.

83
00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:04.967
Sorry about your shirt.

84
00:03:10.834 --> 00:03:12.066
Morning everyone.

85
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.100
It's been another great week
at Seattle City News.

86
00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:17.800
The weekend is coming.
which means another opportunity

87
00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:20.133
to get out there and
find interesting people

88
00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.700
with a story to tell.

89
00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.600
As you know. we're
always looking for fresh ideas

90
00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:26.133
and innovative journalism.

91
00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:27.567
As the editor in chief.

92
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.867
it's my job to help you
grow and build.

93
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.233
I have an important
announcement to make.

94
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.233
Today. we are
welcoming a new member

95
00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:39.300
to the Features and
Human Interest team.

96
00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:42.967
And here he is now.

97
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.367
Please join me in welcoming

98
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.567
Drew Hutton to the team.
everyone.

99
00:03:48.934 --> 00:03:49.800
Wait. Hutton?

100
00:03:49.934 --> 00:03:51.533
Like the Huttons
who own the paper?

101
00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:53.433
Hi everyone.

102
00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:54.867
Sorry I'm late.

103
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.667
I got in a fight with the wrong
iced latte and lost.

104
00:03:58.734 --> 00:04:00.200
But I'm really
excited to be here

105
00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:02.200
and looking forward
to working with you all.

106
00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:04.033
-Here. Drew.
-Oh thanks.

107
00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:05.967
Drew recently
moved back to Seattle

108
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.800
after a stint
as a travel writer.

109
00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:10.133
He's going to be heading up
our Human Interest department

110
00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:12.200
as our new senior journalist.

111
00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:14.333
And Drew. I have
your first assignment.

112
00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:15.767
Oh sure. bring it on.

113
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.700
It's a profile
on an Olivia Klein

114
00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:20.367
from the town
of Sunflower Valley.

115
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.400
It's a sweet story.
something easy to start with.

116
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.533
That was my story.

117
00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:26.500
What?

118
00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.667
Great. so who's Olivia Klein?

119
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.800
And where's Sunflower Valley.
sounds kind of quaint.

120
00:04:31.934 --> 00:04:33.200
[laughter]

121
00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:35.700
My assistant Kate can fill
you in on all the details.

122
00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:37.367
I need you to go
there on Monday.

123
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.533
Alright. everybody.

124
00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:40.900
Please make Drew feel at home.

125
00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:44.066
Keep making me proud. people!

126
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.333
Nice to see you again so soon.

127
00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:54.667
Yeah. I'm glad you
got a new shirt.

128
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.033
Look. I have to go follow...

129
00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:58.300
See you later.

130
00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:03.266
Hey.

131
00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:05.367
Nice to meet you all.

132
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.734
Okay. I have a call
with Grant in a few minutes.

133
00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:10.033
Could you be a lifesaver
and check on my dry cleaning?

134
00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:12.200
I need that dress for the gala.

135
00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:15.600
Is something wrong?

136
00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:19.600
I just. well...

137
00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:21.233
Since I did all the research

138
00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:23.700
and I pitched you
the Olivia Klein story.

139
00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:28.200
I was wondering if you'd
give me a shot at writing it.

140
00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:29.700
You want to write the story?

141
00:05:29.834 --> 00:05:32.200
Yes of course. I'd love to.

142
00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:35.066
You know that's always
been a dream of mine.

143
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.166
Listen Kate. we've talked
about that before.

144
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.700
I have no doubt that someday
you will make a great writer.

145
00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:44.834
but with no degree.
no prior experience...

146
00:05:47.633 --> 00:05:49.033
I love your proposal.

147
00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:52.500
but as editor in chief. I just
can't trust that to you now.

148
00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:53.533
And besides Kate.

149
00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:55.767
you know how much
I need you here.

150
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.934
No of course. I understand.

151
00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:02.133
But hear me out.

152
00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:04.066
I grew up in Sunflower Valley.

153
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.166
I know the people there.

154
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.834
I even know
Olivia Klein's family.

155
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.233
No. I'm sorry we've
just got too much going on.

156
00:06:12.367 --> 00:06:14.233
I still need my
expense report done.

157
00:06:14.367 --> 00:06:17.333
And it's Don's mother's
birthday next Wednesday.

158
00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:18.767
I need a gift.

159
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.834
And do not get me started
on my kitchen renovation.

160
00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:22.900
That's not a problem.

161
00:06:23.033 --> 00:06:24.600
you know how I get things done.

162
00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:25.767
But this would be a chance

163
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.767
on a story that is
very close to my heart.

164
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.200
I hear you.

165
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.100
Okay so. if you can keep up
with everything else.

166
00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:39.500
I don't see why not.

167
00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.433
You're going to let me
write the story?

168
00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:44.100
No. I'm going to
let you go with Drew.

169
00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:46.333
but strictly as a researcher
and his assistant.

170
00:06:46.467 --> 00:06:48.900
You can show him where the bones
are buried. so to speak.

171
00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:51.166
Help him with anything he needs.

172
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.400
But he is the writer on this.
Understood?

173
00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:55.500
Understood.

174
00:06:55.633 --> 00:06:57.266
Thank you.

175
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.166
Try and learn
something from him.

176
00:07:00.934 --> 00:07:02.900
So I'm going.
just me and him?

177
00:07:03.033 --> 00:07:04.500
Get yourself on that flight
Monday morning.

178
00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:06.066
I want a report every day

179
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.400
and I'm still going to
need you to be available 24/7.

180
00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:10.667
Absolutely.

181
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.567
Thank you. Patricia.
I really appreciate it.

182
00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:27.300
♪

183
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.867
Huh. so this is
Sunflower Valley?

184
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.800
Where are all the sunflowers?

185
00:07:50.433 --> 00:07:52.200
We're at the airport.

186
00:07:52.333 --> 00:07:54.367
This is surrounded by miles
of sunflower fields.

187
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.200
Right. I see.
Yeah of course.

188
00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:01.133
I've only ever been
to a lavender field.

189
00:08:01.266 --> 00:08:03.767
That was in the south of France.

190
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.133
There was a lot
of tourists. though.

191
00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:07.066
I'm sure this will
be much quieter.

192
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.800
We have tourists also.

193
00:08:09.834 --> 00:08:10.934
Right. yeah.

194
00:08:11.066 --> 00:08:12.400
Of course you do.

195
00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:13.867
They're... around.

196
00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:17.967
So listen. your cab will
be here in a few minutes.

197
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.100
Sorry about that. there's
only one cab company in town.

198
00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:21.433
Oh no.

199
00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:23.934
Actually. my parents
can drop you at your hotel.

200
00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:25.934
It's on the way to our house.
it's no problem.

201
00:08:26.066 --> 00:08:28.467
You know what.
I wouldn't want to put them out.

202
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.600
I have to say. it's pretty cool
that you're actually from here.

203
00:08:30.734 --> 00:08:34.233
It's like having my own
personal tour guide!

204
00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:35.967
I guess so.

205
00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:39.266
I guess you weren't expecting
to have to chauffeur me--

206
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.300
My parents.

207
00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:43.033
Hey Kate!

208
00:08:44.166 --> 00:08:46.367
Oh my gosh--

209
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.433
Hi Mom!

210
00:08:47.567 --> 00:08:49.100
We've missed you so much.

211
00:08:49.233 --> 00:08:50.700
It's only been a few months.

212
00:08:50.834 --> 00:08:51.967
I know. I'm just so excited!

213
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.700
I can't believe you're
staying for a whole week!

214
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.066
And who's this handsome
young gentleman?

215
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.900
You didn't mention you
were bringing somebody!

216
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.467
Kate never brings anyone home!

217
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.467
Mom.

218
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.800
This is Drew. he's my colleague.

219
00:09:04.934 --> 00:09:07.000
I'm helping him write a story.

220
00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:09.533
I guess I'm his assistant.

221
00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:11.867
Sorry. I didn't have time
to tell you over the phone.

222
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.533
His assistant?

223
00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:15.000
Oh. okay.

224
00:09:15.133 --> 00:09:17.500
Lovely to meet you. Drew.
Welcome to Sunflower Valley!

225
00:09:17.633 --> 00:09:19.367
You know. I had a
second cousin named Drew.

226
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.467
he wasn't half as handsome
as you are.

227
00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:24.800
Thank you. I guess!

228
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.700
It's lovely to meet you too.

229
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.033
Let me help you with that bag.

230
00:09:30.166 --> 00:09:31.100
You know what?

231
00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:33.166
My cab should be here
any second.

232
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.300
If you're waiting for one
of Larry's cabs.

233
00:09:35.433 --> 00:09:37.000
you could be waiting here
about a week.

234
00:09:37.133 --> 00:09:38.200
(laughter)

235
00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:39.367
Where are you staying. son?

236
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.266
We'll be happy to
take you in the truck.

237
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.266
Yeah thank you. that's great.

238
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.333
I think I'm staying
at the Beverly.

239
00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:48.100
-Yeah.
-The Beverly?

240
00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:49.834
Oh no. no way.

241
00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:51.000
Dad. it's fine.

242
00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:52.500
The Seattle City News
is paying for it.

243
00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:53.633
Nonsense honey!

244
00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:54.800
You don't come all
the way from Seattle

245
00:09:54.934 --> 00:09:56.667
to stay in some
soulless corporate hotel!

246
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.533
Not when we have so many
beautiful options here.

247
00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:01.300
You know what?

248
00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:03.834
He can stay in our guest house.
What do you say hon?

249
00:10:03.967 --> 00:10:05.467
Oh sure. we'd love to have you.

250
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.600
That's a very kind offer.

251
00:10:06.734 --> 00:10:08.967
I wouldn't want to impose. so...

252
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.033
See. Drew wants his own space.

253
00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:12.033
And the corporate hotel

254
00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:14.433
is probably way
more up his alley.

255
00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:18.133
You know what.
on second thought.

256
00:10:18.266 --> 00:10:19.867
the guest house
sounds kind of perfect.

257
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.166
I mean. do as the
locals do. right?

258
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.934
Trust me. I've stayed
in plenty of hotels.

259
00:10:24.066 --> 00:10:24.967
I'm not missing much.

260
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.967
Wonderful.

261
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.166
You can say that again.

262
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.734
-I'll get that for you.
-Thank you.

263
00:10:30.767 --> 00:10:31.967
Here. I'll take that.

264
00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:35.967
We actually renovated the
guest house a few years ago.

265
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.433
I gave it kind of Italian
Tuscan type theme.

266
00:10:39.567 --> 00:10:40.800
-Right. Joe?
-Right. honey.

267
00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.934
♪

268
00:11:00.367 --> 00:11:02.767
Alright Drew. this is us.

269
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.600
And the guesthouse is just a
little further along that path.

270
00:11:05.734 --> 00:11:06.667
Joe will show you.

271
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.400
Great thank you so much.
both of you.

272
00:11:08.533 --> 00:11:10.533
What a treat to stay
in such a homey place.

273
00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:11.734
It's no bother.

274
00:11:11.867 --> 00:11:13.166
If you need anything.
you just let us know

275
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.266
and I'll get Joe to bring down
a plate of snacks later.

276
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.834
Wow. thanks again.

277
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.767
Kate. I'll see you
bright and early.

278
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.166
See you tomorrow.

279
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.834
Come on. I'll show you
where you live.

280
00:11:22.967 --> 00:11:24.333
Have a good night.

281
00:11:27.066 --> 00:11:28.433
Welcome home.

282
00:11:29.967 --> 00:11:31.600
Come on. let's get you settled.

283
00:11:32.533 --> 00:11:34.934
He's a catch!
And very friendly.

284
00:11:35.066 --> 00:11:37.600
Yeah. but you
and dad didn't need

285
00:11:37.734 --> 00:11:39.900
to roll out the
red carpet for him.

286
00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:43.066
He's only a colleague
and I just met him.

287
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.533
Honey. we are very proud of
our hospitality around here.

288
00:11:45.667 --> 00:11:46.934
You know that.

289
00:11:47.066 --> 00:11:51.266
He seems nice and happens
to be very handsome.

290
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.100
He's not that handsome.

291
00:11:54.533 --> 00:11:57.266
Well anyway. I should manage
your expectations.

292
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.700
That is not
what's happening here!

293
00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:02.667
He's just another guy
doing my dream job.

294
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.500
Oh. I'm sorry you didn't
get the news you wanted.

295
00:12:04.633 --> 00:12:05.567
What happened?

296
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.233
Well. she read my submission.

297
00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:09.100
Then she gave the story
to this guy.

298
00:12:09.233 --> 00:12:11.000
I practically begged
for the opportunity

299
00:12:11.133 --> 00:12:13.233
to write on the piece.
but I don't know.

300
00:12:13.367 --> 00:12:16.100
He's new and he's the
CEO's son. or something.

301
00:12:16.233 --> 00:12:17.934
Oh really. the owner's son?

302
00:12:19.633 --> 00:12:20.767
Yes and what?

303
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.400
He gets to write my story.
our story.

304
00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:25.333
about our town. our legacy.

305
00:12:25.467 --> 00:12:26.967
Why him?

306
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.834
It's like Patricia doesn't see
my potential as a writer.

307
00:12:29.967 --> 00:12:32.266
She only sees me as a gofer
or something.

308
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.300
You're not a gofer.
you're my beautiful daughter.

309
00:12:35.433 --> 00:12:38.400
You have to look at
this as an opportunity.

310
00:12:38.533 --> 00:12:40.300
Your time will come.

311
00:12:40.433 --> 00:12:42.266
Thanks. mom.

312
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.400
It's not the quite the same.
but I know you're right.

313
00:12:52.967 --> 00:12:55.367
Okay. so here is the itinerary.

314
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.467
Wow. itinerary?

315
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.266
Do we really need one?

316
00:13:00.233 --> 00:13:02.100
Every trip needs an itinerary.

317
00:13:02.233 --> 00:13:03.567
Plus. I love a plan. so--

318
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.266
Sorry. how many pages is this?

319
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.033
I hope you scheduled us
some free time in here.

320
00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:11.567
You're welcome.

321
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.900
How did you even have time
to do all this?

322
00:13:14.033 --> 00:13:16.266
That's what weekends are for.

323
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.400
Remind me never to spend
a weekend with you.

324
00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:21.700
Anyway. so I thought
we would start

325
00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:24.200
at Olivia's old lake house.
see where she came from--

326
00:13:24.333 --> 00:13:25.166
Sorry. hang on.

327
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.567
Can we take
a quick step back?

328
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.033
Who is Olivia and why
are we writing about her?

329
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.500
You didn't read my brief.
did you?

330
00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:38.667
No.

331
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.367
So...

332
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.533
Olivia Klein.

333
00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:45.734
She was born in 1900
here in Sunflower--

334
00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:47.433
Wow. that must mean she's...

335
00:13:49.066 --> 00:13:51.200
Wait. how old is she?

336
00:13:51.333 --> 00:13:55.400
Wow. you really did not
read my brief.

337
00:13:55.533 --> 00:13:57.767
She has been passed away
for over 40 years.

338
00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.700
Right. that makes
a lot more sense.

339
00:13:59.834 --> 00:14:03.233
Okay and what was so special
about this Olivia Klein?

340
00:14:03.367 --> 00:14:05.467
Well. recently one
of her family members

341
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.633
found some of her old
journal entries.

342
00:14:07.767 --> 00:14:09.667
And they contain dozens
of stories of people

343
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.000
she helped all over Sunflower
with matters of the heart.

344
00:14:13.133 --> 00:14:15.300
Her family didn't really
know anything about it.

345
00:14:15.433 --> 00:14:18.000
so I thought it would be
interesting to delve deeper.

346
00:14:18.133 --> 00:14:19.300
Matters of the heart?

347
00:14:19.433 --> 00:14:20.900
Is that your way of saying love?

348
00:14:22.433 --> 00:14:24.133
Anyway. all her life.

349
00:14:24.266 --> 00:14:26.934
she kind of set people up.
like a matchmaker.

350
00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:28.967
And according to these journals.

351
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.967
there were a lot
of success stories.

352
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.300
Some of the people she helped
are still around.

353
00:14:34.433 --> 00:14:36.233
Sounds like you're a big fan
of this woman. huh?

354
00:14:36.367 --> 00:14:38.433
Yeah. I think we would
have gotten along.

355
00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:41.000
Okay. so what's the plan?

356
00:14:41.133 --> 00:14:43.233
Well. I asked around

357
00:14:43.367 --> 00:14:44.967
and I managed to find
a few of the couples

358
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.133
from the journals.

359
00:14:46.266 --> 00:14:47.800
So. I set it up for you
to interview them

360
00:14:47.934 --> 00:14:49.266
and then I thought
between interviews

361
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.800
I could show you the sights
of Sunflower Valley.

362
00:14:51.934 --> 00:14:54.333
That should give you enough
for you to write your piece.

363
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.166
What's the matter?

364
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.567
I don't know.

365
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.734
I just wasn't really
expecting this kind of thing.

366
00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:03.233
When Patricia said
human interest.

367
00:15:03.367 --> 00:15:04.367
I thought maybe this Olivia

368
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.800
had done something
extraordinary.

369
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.400
What could be more
extraordinary than love?

370
00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:15.967
[snickers]

371
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.266
What's funny?

372
00:15:18.967 --> 00:15:20.300
I'm sorry. you can
call me a cynic.

373
00:15:20.433 --> 00:15:24.066
but you don't really believe
in all that stuff. do you?

374
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.800
Believe in what stuff. love?

375
00:15:26.934 --> 00:15:29.300
Yeah. of course I do.

376
00:15:29.433 --> 00:15:31.600
And wow. you really are a cynic.

377
00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:34.734
Matchmaking? I don't know.

378
00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:36.467
I'm just not sure I'm the man
for this job.

379
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.066
Some people would kill
to write this story.

380
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.900
It means a lot to me.

381
00:15:41.033 --> 00:15:43.133
I really want us to...

382
00:15:43.266 --> 00:15:44.967
you. to do it justice.

383
00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:50.967
Sure. yeah.

384
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.667
So what's first?

385
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.066
Okay.

386
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.800
I thought we would start
at Olivia's old lake house.

387
00:15:56.934 --> 00:15:58.200
Olivia's lake house - okay.

388
00:15:58.333 --> 00:15:59.834
And how are we
getting there. cab?

389
00:15:59.967 --> 00:16:01.066
That could take days.

390
00:16:02.233 --> 00:16:05.333
No. I have set up
a little surprise.

391
00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:09.867
♪

392
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.367
Okay. so you can see
the sunflower fields

393
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.800
much better from up here.

394
00:16:13.934 --> 00:16:17.266
Yeah. some of them.
Beautiful. isn't it?

395
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.900
I used to play hide-and-seek
in those fields.

396
00:16:20.033 --> 00:16:22.033
Sunflower Valley
sure is beautiful.

397
00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:23.200
Yeah.

398
00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:24.433
There's a little creek
down on the left.

399
00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.300
we're going to pass it
in a minute.

400
00:16:27.834 --> 00:16:28.767
You're really lucky to be from

401
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.567
such a charming
part of the world.

402
00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:33.033
Look. Kate...

403
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.266
Can we start over?

404
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.734
I feel like maybe we
got off on the wrong foot.

405
00:16:37.867 --> 00:16:39.633
When I spilled coffee
all over you.

406
00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:42.834
or when we were randomly sent
to Sunflower Valley together?

407
00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:47.967
This assignment seems
really important to you.

408
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.266
Patricia said you had
some sort of connection to it.

409
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.800
More than a connection.

410
00:16:53.934 --> 00:16:55.300
The story was my idea.

411
00:16:56.767 --> 00:16:58.400
Really?

412
00:16:58.533 --> 00:16:59.934
I didn't even...

413
00:17:00.133 --> 00:17:01.867
What am I doing here then?

414
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.800
Well I'm just Patricia's PA.

415
00:17:03.934 --> 00:17:05.100
I don't write the stories.

416
00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.400
I just come up with ideas
every now and then.

417
00:17:08.467 --> 00:17:11.633
And it is very dear to my heart.

418
00:17:11.767 --> 00:17:13.200
But the most
important thing to me

419
00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:16.800
is that we do justice by Olivia
and we tell her story correctly.

420
00:17:16.934 --> 00:17:18.367
Yeah. I agree.

421
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.834
I'm in.

422
00:17:20.967 --> 00:17:22.767
I think we'll make a great team.

423
00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:26.200
Alright. here we go.

424
00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:33.967
This is Olivia's house.

425
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.567
What do you think?

426
00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:39.133
It's beautiful.

427
00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:40.767
Do I get the 50 cent tour?

428
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.934
Sure.

429
00:17:42.066 --> 00:17:43.600
And for you. the VIP discount.

430
00:17:43.734 --> 00:17:44.633
Oh...

431
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.667
So nobody actually lives here?

432
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.934
Not at the moment.

433
00:17:52.066 --> 00:17:53.967
The family has been doing
a big renovation.

434
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.166
Sweet.

435
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.867
And the family is okay
with our assignment?

436
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.433
Absolutely. we have
their full blessing.

437
00:17:59.567 --> 00:18:02.767
They are very intrigued
to see what we find out.

438
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.200
Okay.

439
00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:06.266
Oh. and do you have that journal
you were talking about?

440
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.700
I should probably
take a look at that.

441
00:18:07.834 --> 00:18:09.033
Yeah.

442
00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:10.900
But I left it at home.
I'll show it to you later.

443
00:18:11.033 --> 00:18:12.533
Okay.

444
00:18:12.667 --> 00:18:15.000
I will stop asking questions
because I can see

445
00:18:15.133 --> 00:18:17.000
that you thought of everything.

446
00:18:19.166 --> 00:18:21.900
So. Olivia lived here
with her husband. Gordon.

447
00:18:22.033 --> 00:18:23.333
and their three children.

448
00:18:23.467 --> 00:18:25.400
And when Olivia and Gordon's
time passed.

449
00:18:25.533 --> 00:18:27.433
the family decided to keep
the home

450
00:18:27.567 --> 00:18:29.400
as kind of a second
family house.

451
00:18:29.533 --> 00:18:33.033
so they could keep enjoying it.
and these views.

452
00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:34.500
Yeah. I can see why.

453
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.367
And this is Olivia and Gordon
on their wedding day.

454
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.200
They got married right here
at the lake.

455
00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:44.166
Apparently it was a
beautiful summer's day.

456
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.300
Just perfect.

457
00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:49.100
I've always thought
it would be magical.

458
00:18:51.233 --> 00:18:53.834
Is there anyone
special back in Seattle?

459
00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:55.567
I'd be happy to drop
a few hints for you.

460
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.700
No.

461
00:18:58.066 --> 00:18:59.867
Just a little dream I have.

462
00:19:02.066 --> 00:19:03.900
I'll show you the lake.

463
00:19:04.033 --> 00:19:04.834
Great.

464
00:19:04.967 --> 00:19:06.600
Wow. what a view.

465
00:19:07.934 --> 00:19:09.600
I know.

466
00:19:09.734 --> 00:19:12.567
This place is a
little piece of heaven.

467
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.533
The perfect place to do
some crafty matchmaking!

468
00:19:17.467 --> 00:19:20.333
I can tell this place
means something to you.

469
00:19:20.467 --> 00:19:22.433
Well. who wouldn't like it here?

470
00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:24.100
Plus. country air
is food for the soul.

471
00:19:24.233 --> 00:19:25.600
My mom always says that.

472
00:19:25.734 --> 00:19:28.266
And there's plenty of it here.

473
00:19:30.533 --> 00:19:32.800
You ready to meet
the first couple?

474
00:19:32.934 --> 00:19:35.400
Absolutely. let's do this.

475
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.033
[door knocking]

476
00:19:40.433 --> 00:19:41.433
Hi.

477
00:19:41.567 --> 00:19:42.600
You must be Freddie.

478
00:19:42.734 --> 00:19:44.100
It's lovely to
meet you in person.

479
00:19:44.233 --> 00:19:45.567
We spoke on the phone.

480
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.233
I'm Kate Francis and this
is my colleague Drew Hutton.

481
00:19:48.367 --> 00:19:50.300
He'll be writing
the piece on Olivia.

482
00:19:50.433 --> 00:19:53.667
Actually. Kate will be
leading our interview.

483
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.333
-I will?
-Yeah.

484
00:19:55.467 --> 00:19:56.400
I will.

485
00:19:57.567 --> 00:20:00.066
Honey. the newspaper people
are here.

486
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.834
It's awfully nice to meet you.

487
00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:03.400
It's nice to meet you.

488
00:20:03.533 --> 00:20:05.800
Hi. why don't we sit
out here in the yard

489
00:20:05.934 --> 00:20:08.467
and I'll go get us some
homemade blackberry cordial?

490
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.133
Blackberry cordial?

491
00:20:10.266 --> 00:20:13.333
Betty. you're speaking
my language.

492
00:20:13.467 --> 00:20:15.600
Why did you tell them
I was doing the interview?

493
00:20:15.734 --> 00:20:16.900
I'm not supposed to.

494
00:20:17.033 --> 00:20:18.433
Patricia said that
I'm the writer.

495
00:20:18.567 --> 00:20:19.633
but she never said
anything about

496
00:20:19.767 --> 00:20:21.967
who could ask the questions.

497
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.433
Let's do this together.

498
00:20:23.567 --> 00:20:24.934
Here we go!

499
00:20:25.066 --> 00:20:26.734
Fresh blackberry fizz.

500
00:20:26.867 --> 00:20:28.600
It's a little on the sweet side.

501
00:20:28.734 --> 00:20:29.600
Just like you. honey.

502
00:20:29.734 --> 00:20:31.033
Oh. stop it Freddie!

503
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.934
That's lovely. thank you.

504
00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:37.567
Oh Betty. oh that's sweet.

505
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.900
That's nice.

506
00:20:40.967 --> 00:20:43.934
Now. what would you
like us to do?

507
00:20:44.066 --> 00:20:46.767
We've never been
interviewed before.

508
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.500
it's all very exciting!

509
00:20:48.633 --> 00:20:50.900
But we're a little nervous.

510
00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:52.600
Well firstly. umm...

511
00:20:54.867 --> 00:20:57.633
thank you so much
speaking with us.

512
00:20:57.767 --> 00:20:59.233
As I wrote you.
we're doing a piece

513
00:20:59.367 --> 00:21:00.834
based on journal's
of Olivia Klein

514
00:21:00.967 --> 00:21:02.800
that her children
recently discovered.

515
00:21:02.934 --> 00:21:05.633
Oh. Olivia was so wonderful.

516
00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:09.300
She's the very reason
why Freddie and I

517
00:21:09.433 --> 00:21:11.967
are sitting here together today!

518
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.133
So tell me more about how
you knew Olivia.

519
00:21:14.266 --> 00:21:16.133
Now hang on a second.

520
00:21:16.266 --> 00:21:20.133
Betty. I need the get the recipe
for this blackberry fizz.

521
00:21:20.266 --> 00:21:22.467
Oh. it's very easy.

522
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.867
Just a little fermentation
and a lot of sugar!

523
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:26.967
Right.

524
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:27.967
Freddie. I get the feeling

525
00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.300
she spoils you
like this a lot. huh?

526
00:21:29.433 --> 00:21:30.300
Absolutely.

527
00:21:30.433 --> 00:21:31.967
Betty's a great cook. too.

528
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:36.000
Oh. well remind us to come back
for a meal sometime.

529
00:21:36.133 --> 00:21:37.667
I was born and raised
in New York City.

530
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.567
but my family used to summer
in Sunflower every year.

531
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.300
Betty worked at the
local florist here.

532
00:21:43.433 --> 00:21:44.734
I have to tell you.

533
00:21:44.867 --> 00:21:47.467
the first time I laid eyes
on her in that flower shop.

534
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.133
I thought I'd seen an angel.

535
00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:50.900
Oh. stop it Freddie.

536
00:21:51.033 --> 00:21:53.166
He wasn't too shabby either.

537
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.133
But he came from
a very well to do family

538
00:21:56.266 --> 00:21:58.300
and they just
spent summers here.

539
00:21:58.433 --> 00:22:00.400
So I didn't hold out much hope.

540
00:22:00.533 --> 00:22:01.667
But I did!

541
00:22:02.767 --> 00:22:04.934
We couldn't get enough
of each other.

542
00:22:05.066 --> 00:22:06.900
It was the most magical summer.

543
00:22:07.033 --> 00:22:08.867
But when Freddie's folks
found out

544
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.367
that he was getting
serious on me.

545
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.400
that was the last summer
they spent here.

546
00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:15.233
When I told them
that I loved Betty

547
00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:17.767
and I wanted to
marry her someday.

548
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.033
they made sure I'd
never see her again.

549
00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:22.233
I was devastated.

550
00:22:22.367 --> 00:22:25.467
But my mom told me
that if it was meant to be.

551
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.200
he would write.

552
00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:28.600
I had been writing to her.

553
00:22:28.734 --> 00:22:30.700
I wrote her dozens of letters.

554
00:22:30.834 --> 00:22:34.834
But eventually I stopped
because I never got any back.

555
00:22:36.166 --> 00:22:38.633
That's terrible.
it must have been so hard.

556
00:22:39.834 --> 00:22:41.300
Is that when you met Olivia?

557
00:22:41.433 --> 00:22:42.800
Exactly.

558
00:22:42.934 --> 00:22:44.633
She had come into
the shop one day

559
00:22:44.767 --> 00:22:47.567
and was immediately
sensitive to my mood

560
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.533
and asked me about it.

561
00:22:49.667 --> 00:22:52.734
I told her the whole story
about me and Freddie

562
00:22:52.867 --> 00:22:55.133
and how I hadn't heard
a single word from him

563
00:22:55.266 --> 00:22:56.233
since he'd left.

564
00:22:56.367 --> 00:22:57.233
What did she do?

565
00:22:57.367 --> 00:22:59.400
This was hard for me to believe.

566
00:22:59.533 --> 00:23:03.033
but after I told her everything.
unbeknownst to me.

567
00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:06.300
she took it upon herself
to travel to New York

568
00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:09.266
and contacted Freddie's parents.

569
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.166
It cost her a fortune.

570
00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.000
and she only knew me
as a flower girl.

571
00:23:14.133 --> 00:23:17.033
I was there when she came
to our apartment.

572
00:23:17.166 --> 00:23:19.367
In front of my parents.
she asked me

573
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.300
if I knew Betty from Sunflower

574
00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:22.767
and had I tried
to reach out to her?

575
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.667
Olivia knew something strange
was going on.

576
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.867
So she finally got
Freddie's folks to admit

577
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.633
that they had bribed the postman
not to send his letters

578
00:23:32.767 --> 00:23:35.000
and make sure he never saw mine.

579
00:23:35.133 --> 00:23:36.934
Somehow. she got
through to them.

580
00:23:37.066 --> 00:23:39.000
The next summer they returned

581
00:23:39.133 --> 00:23:42.600
and my Freddie
came back to Sunflower.

582
00:23:42.734 --> 00:23:45.867
And here we are over
50 years later!

583
00:23:47.266 --> 00:23:48.700
So...

584
00:23:48.834 --> 00:23:51.300
why do you think Olivia
became so invested?

585
00:23:51.433 --> 00:23:53.633
It sounds like she
really went above and beyond.

586
00:23:53.767 --> 00:23:54.767
Oh definitely.

587
00:23:56.333 --> 00:24:01.000
She would say that everyone
deserves to love and be loved.

588
00:24:02.834 --> 00:24:05.367
Oh Freddie. show them
the sunflower!

589
00:24:06.567 --> 00:24:08.867
Who could argue
with that philosophy?

590
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.600
She changed our lives.

591
00:24:13.066 --> 00:24:14.667
What's this?

592
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.934
This was Olivia's
wedding gift to us.

593
00:24:18.066 --> 00:24:21.033
Oh. a sunflower?

594
00:24:21.166 --> 00:24:23.867
You know. sunflowers
are traditionally

595
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.800
a symbol of longevity
and lifelong happiness.

596
00:24:29.033 --> 00:24:30.266
It reminds us every day.

597
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.200
how lucky we are to
have found each other

598
00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:34.834
and how thankful
we are to Olivia.

599
00:24:36.133 --> 00:24:38.667
It's a really beautiful story.
you two.

600
00:24:39.967 --> 00:24:41.834
You know honestly.

601
00:24:41.967 --> 00:24:44.600
I think love like yours
might be from a time gone by.

602
00:24:44.734 --> 00:24:46.700
Oh. I'm not so sure about that.

603
00:24:46.834 --> 00:24:48.500
Thank you so much
for talking with us.

604
00:24:48.633 --> 00:24:50.000
Anytime.

605
00:24:50.133 --> 00:24:51.400
And thank you for this fizz.

606
00:24:51.533 --> 00:24:53.367
I'm gonna have to try
this recipe.

607
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.567
To Olivia.

608
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:55.767
To Olivia.

609
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.767
To Olivia.

610
00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.567
-To Olivia.
-To Olivia.

611
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.767
[phone ringing]

612
00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:07.567
Oh. it's Patricia.

613
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.133
I'll let you.

614
00:25:09.266 --> 00:25:10.233
Thanks.

615
00:25:11.834 --> 00:25:13.633
Hi Patricia. everything okay?

616
00:25:13.767 --> 00:25:15.867
Not really. my dress
for tonight's charity gala

617
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.734
never came back
from the cleaners.

618
00:25:17.867 --> 00:25:18.834
It hasn't.

619
00:25:18.967 --> 00:25:20.133
Oh. I'm sorry.

620
00:25:20.266 --> 00:25:21.800
Let me call them and find out
what's happened.

621
00:25:21.934 --> 00:25:24.066
Okay. I need it by tonight.

622
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.467
How's Drew's story coming?

623
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.000
It's coming along.

624
00:25:28.133 --> 00:25:30.033
We just interviewed
the most lovely couple.

625
00:25:30.166 --> 00:25:32.233
How are you guys getting along?

626
00:25:32.367 --> 00:25:33.967
I'm helping get the job done.

627
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.533
Great. hurry back.

628
00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:36.934
Okay. bye.

629
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.700
Everything okay?

630
00:25:44.834 --> 00:25:48.300
Oh yeah. nothing I'm
not used to with work.

631
00:25:48.433 --> 00:25:52.734
My job can be a little
uninspiring sometimes.

632
00:25:52.867 --> 00:25:55.000
But I shouldn't complain.

633
00:25:55.133 --> 00:25:56.667
You want me to call a cab?

634
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.867
Well. the weather is still nice.

635
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.300
You feel like walking back?

636
00:26:01.433 --> 00:26:02.567
Sure.

637
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.700
Great.

638
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.200
That was some story
back there. huh?

639
00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:10.533
Yeah. it was pretty sweet.

640
00:26:10.667 --> 00:26:13.200
Sounds like they
got really lucky.

641
00:26:13.333 --> 00:26:15.567
Might not have been just luck.

642
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.467
Maybe it was fate.

643
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.800
Right. the soulmates thing.

644
00:26:19.934 --> 00:26:21.533
Why are you so
against that idea?

645
00:26:21.667 --> 00:26:23.066
I'm not against it.

646
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.467
I just think it's a way of you
making order out of serendipity.

647
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.467
Maybe I'm just too much
of a pragmatist.

648
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.867
I guess you are.

649
00:26:32.033 --> 00:26:34.800
Look. if Freddie and Betty
were meant to be.

650
00:26:34.934 --> 00:26:37.800
would they have been
without Olivia?

651
00:26:37.934 --> 00:26:39.900
Olivia might have
been the agent of fate.

652
00:26:41.867 --> 00:26:43.233
Touché.

653
00:26:46.266 --> 00:26:48.867
Thank you for helping me
at the start there.

654
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.300
Think I kind of jumped the gun

655
00:26:50.433 --> 00:26:51.533
before they were ready
back there.

656
00:26:51.667 --> 00:26:52.734
No. you were fine.

657
00:26:52.867 --> 00:26:54.867
I just think you can
get more out of people

658
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.633
if you make them at home
from the beginning.

659
00:26:56.767 --> 00:26:59.133
If you mention
the little things.

660
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.767
It really seemed to really work.

661
00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:02.900
Thanks.

662
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.033
So how long have you been
at Seattle City News?

663
00:27:08.166 --> 00:27:09.500
Five years.

664
00:27:09.633 --> 00:27:11.000
Wow!

665
00:27:11.133 --> 00:27:12.800
So what's next for you?

666
00:27:12.934 --> 00:27:15.867
Well. junior journalist
is my next career goal.

667
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.433
I have been trying to enroll
in classes online.

668
00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.800
How's that going?

669
00:27:21.934 --> 00:27:22.767
No time.

670
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.200
Patricia's got me
working 24/7.

671
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.934
Well. I wouldn't give up.

672
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.300
Thanks. I won't.

673
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.834
I don't know about you.
but I am starving.

674
00:27:37.967 --> 00:27:39.367
Do you have any dinner plans

675
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.166
in that little schedule
of yours?

676
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.133
I do. my mom is making dinner.

677
00:27:43.266 --> 00:27:45.767
-Nice.
-Yeah.

678
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.633
I can recommend
Giovanni's in town.

679
00:27:47.767 --> 00:27:50.667
They have really good
thin crust.

680
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.467
Oh yeah. right.

681
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.934
I'll head over there.

682
00:28:09.967 --> 00:28:13.033
So. how did it go today?

683
00:28:13.166 --> 00:28:14.700
With Drew. I mean.

684
00:28:14.834 --> 00:28:17.533
You know. it wasn't so bad.

685
00:28:17.667 --> 00:28:19.367
He didn't do much
research beforehand.

686
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.934
but when the interview got going
he was really good.

687
00:28:23.066 --> 00:28:24.834
He taught me a few things.

688
00:28:24.967 --> 00:28:27.066
He has a way of
connecting with people.

689
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.066
Just like you.

690
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.500
See that's great!

691
00:28:29.633 --> 00:28:31.400
I knew you two would get along
like a house on fire.

692
00:28:31.533 --> 00:28:33.066
I wouldn't go that far.

693
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.500
Honey. we need napkins!

694
00:28:35.633 --> 00:28:37.734
And one more plate.

695
00:28:37.867 --> 00:28:39.033
Why do you need one more plate?

696
00:28:39.166 --> 00:28:40.700
I thought it was going
to be the three of us

697
00:28:40.834 --> 00:28:41.533
for dinner tonight?

698
00:28:41.667 --> 00:28:43.500
And Drew. of course.

699
00:28:43.633 --> 00:28:45.266
You invited Drew?

700
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.033
Of course. where else is
he gonna eat. Giovanni's?

701
00:28:48.166 --> 00:28:49.667
Yeah. exactly.

702
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.100
Mom. we're working together.

703
00:28:51.233 --> 00:28:52.600
He's practically
my boss right now.

704
00:28:52.734 --> 00:28:54.333
I want to keep our
personal lives separate.

705
00:28:54.467 --> 00:28:55.700
Oh don't be silly sweetie.

706
00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:58.500
that's not the way we
do things here in Sunflower.

707
00:28:58.633 --> 00:29:00.367
-Hey.
-Hi.

708
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.934
These are for you.

709
00:29:03.066 --> 00:29:04.400
I figured you guys see
enough sunflowers.

710
00:29:04.533 --> 00:29:07.233
so I thought tulips.

711
00:29:07.367 --> 00:29:08.166
Thanks.

712
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.834
Thank you. how thoughtful.

713
00:29:10.967 --> 00:29:13.033
Yes. that was thoughtful.

714
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.233
I knew she was up to something!

715
00:29:17.367 --> 00:29:18.800
She saw me leaving for town
and invited me.

716
00:29:18.934 --> 00:29:20.600
I hope you don't mind me
joining.

717
00:29:20.734 --> 00:29:21.834
No. of course not.

718
00:29:21.967 --> 00:29:23.100
It's a lovely surprise.

719
00:29:24.633 --> 00:29:26.834
Plus. you said you wanted
the full Sunflower experience.

720
00:29:26.967 --> 00:29:30.000
Buckle up. my mom is famous
for this chicken dish.

721
00:29:31.433 --> 00:29:33.266
So there I am.
I stride out the door

722
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.467
thinking I've got the world
at my feet. when bam!

723
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.767
In comes Kate and her
12 coffee cups

724
00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.467
crashing right into me!

725
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.900
And that was my introduction
to your daughter. right there.

726
00:29:43.033 --> 00:29:45.667
The start of a great
working relationship!

727
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.233
No. it was terrible.
I felt so bad!

728
00:29:48.367 --> 00:29:51.266
Well honey. it sounds like you
inherited my elegance and grace!

729
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.500
Excuse me. my old ballet teacher
would disagree!

730
00:29:54.633 --> 00:29:56.300
You were always perfect
at everything.

731
00:29:56.433 --> 00:29:58.000
Wow. thank you mom.

732
00:29:58.133 --> 00:29:59.600
I'm glad you feel that way.

733
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.333
I bet you all got
some pretty great stories

734
00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:03.500
growing up around here.

735
00:30:03.633 --> 00:30:05.300
Never a dull moment
in Sunflower Valley.

736
00:30:05.433 --> 00:30:06.467
I can tell you that much.

737
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.467
Kate used to play in
the sunflower fields

738
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.467
nearby every day.

739
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.166
Where did you grow up. Drew?

740
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.633
Me?

741
00:30:13.767 --> 00:30:15.467
I'm a city boy.
through and through.

742
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.834
Grew up just outside of Seattle.

743
00:30:16.967 --> 00:30:19.800
Me. my parents.
my older brother. Tim.

744
00:30:19.934 --> 00:30:21.800
We had a really great childhood.

745
00:30:21.934 --> 00:30:23.467
Drew's dad is a pretty big deal.

746
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.667
Grant Hutton owns
the Seattle City News.

747
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.834
The parent company.

748
00:30:26.967 --> 00:30:29.233
Your family has owned it
for years. right?

749
00:30:29.367 --> 00:30:30.433
Yeah.

750
00:30:30.567 --> 00:30:31.834
My grandfather bought
his first newspaper

751
00:30:31.967 --> 00:30:33.633
in Spokane in '47.

752
00:30:33.767 --> 00:30:35.300
Now we're pretty big.

753
00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:37.500
My dad took over the reigns
after my grandad passed

754
00:30:37.633 --> 00:30:39.800
and my older brother Tim
is in real estate.

755
00:30:39.934 --> 00:30:42.834
So it all kind of falls to me.

756
00:30:42.967 --> 00:30:45.166
When do you plan on taking over?

757
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.000
Not sure.

758
00:30:47.133 --> 00:30:48.567
We'll have to see.

759
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.934
I've been a travel writer
for the past 12 years.

760
00:30:51.066 --> 00:30:52.266
Sort of heard the calling

761
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.133
to get more involved
in the family business.

762
00:30:54.266 --> 00:30:56.233
so here I am.

763
00:30:56.367 --> 00:30:57.166
A travel writer?

764
00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.834
That sounds like
an exciting life.

765
00:30:58.967 --> 00:31:01.300
A man of the world.

766
00:31:01.433 --> 00:31:03.967
It's an interesting job
for a businessman's son. though.

767
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.333
Not exactly the button down
world I would've expected.

768
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.533
Yeah well. I've always been one
to take the road less traveled.

769
00:31:11.667 --> 00:31:13.166
But here I am now.

770
00:31:14.834 --> 00:31:18.834
So. first full day
in Sunflower Valley.

771
00:31:18.967 --> 00:31:20.000
What's the verdict?

772
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.133
Well let's see.

773
00:31:23.266 --> 00:31:24.867
Horse drawn carriage.

774
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
adorable elderly couple
still hopelessly in love.

775
00:31:28.133 --> 00:31:29.500
Whole lots of sunflowers.

776
00:31:31.133 --> 00:31:33.533
Topped off with one of the best
chicken dishes I've ever tasted.

777
00:31:33.667 --> 00:31:36.133
I'd say we're off to
a pretty good start.

778
00:31:36.266 --> 00:31:38.467
Country air is food
for the soul.

779
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.800
I'll have to agree with that.

780
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.867
And on that note.
I am going to turn in.

781
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.033
Okay.

782
00:31:47.166 --> 00:31:48.967
Thank you so much
again Mrs. Francis.

783
00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:49.967
for a wonderful meal.

784
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.233
Please. call me Linda.

785
00:31:51.367 --> 00:31:52.867
And thank you so much
for the flowers.

786
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.400
Yeah. I have my mother to thank
for raising me right.

787
00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.567
-Night.
-Night.

788
00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.800
-Goodnight.
-Night. Drew.

789
00:32:01.433 --> 00:32:02.867
[sigh]

790
00:32:03.767 --> 00:32:05.467
Handsome and a gentleman.

791
00:32:07.066 --> 00:32:17.033
Mom. will you stop.

792
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.900
Hi.

793
00:32:27.033 --> 00:32:28.133
Hey.

794
00:32:28.266 --> 00:32:31.033
Uh... you don't
look ready to go.

795
00:32:31.166 --> 00:32:34.100
I'm not. I just got out
of the shower.

796
00:32:34.233 --> 00:32:36.367
-Morning.
-Morning.

797
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.533
Wow. you look nice.

798
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.700
Thank you!

799
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.467
I didn't think we
were meeting until later.

800
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.767
Well. if you checked
your trusty itinerary.

801
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.633
you would know we
are meeting right now.

802
00:32:47.767 --> 00:32:50.233
I see. Guilty again. yeah.

803
00:32:50.367 --> 00:32:51.767
Want to come in?
I'll just be a few minutes.

804
00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.233
That's okay. I'll wait out here.

805
00:32:54.367 --> 00:32:55.367
Sure.

806
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.166
I brought the journals with me.

807
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.967
I thought we could
have a little picnic

808
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.333
and read through them.

809
00:33:06.467 --> 00:33:09.000
Makes reading through old pages
much more appealing!

810
00:33:09.133 --> 00:33:11.367
That sounds good.
where are we going?

811
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.934
This spot I love
by the main lake.

812
00:33:14.066 --> 00:33:15.500
It's always super quiet.

813
00:33:15.633 --> 00:33:18.900
I actually call it
my thinking place.

814
00:33:20.767 --> 00:33:21.767
Perfect.

815
00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.800
Oh. and we're bicycling there.

816
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.934
Right.

817
00:33:29.066 --> 00:33:30.300
You're gonna love it.

818
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.100
♪

819
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.367
I've forgotten how much
I miss this.

820
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.133
Country breeze with
the sun on our backs.

821
00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:39.500
There's nothing like it.

822
00:33:39.633 --> 00:33:41.333
Yeah. it's nice.

823
00:33:41.467 --> 00:33:43.934
Come on Drew. loosen up.
Enjoy the ride!

824
00:33:44.066 --> 00:33:45.200
I'm all good. thank you.

825
00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:47.133
Just haven't been on
a bike in a long time.

826
00:33:47.266 --> 00:33:48.200
Wait. what?

827
00:33:48.333 --> 00:33:49.767
You were a travel writer!

828
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.033
What do you mean?

829
00:33:51.166 --> 00:33:52.333
You didn't jump on a bicycle
every once in a while?

830
00:33:52.467 --> 00:33:54.133
Not really. no.

831
00:33:54.266 --> 00:33:56.433
I did get on this Tuk-Tuk
one time in Thailand.

832
00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:59.100
But that. that was enough
to scare me for life.

833
00:33:59.233 --> 00:34:02.100
Other than that.
it was all planes and buses.

834
00:34:02.233 --> 00:34:03.166
Sounds exciting though.

835
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.200
Yeah.

836
00:34:13.867 --> 00:34:16.066
So this barn.

837
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.266
it's kind of a
sad story. actually.

838
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.867
It's just a big old barn now.

839
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.934
but it used be the youth center.

840
00:34:22.834 --> 00:34:25.033
It's a great location.

841
00:34:25.166 --> 00:34:27.533
What kind of
youth center was it?

842
00:34:27.667 --> 00:34:29.734
Just a place where kids from all
kinds of different backgrounds

843
00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:31.433
could come socialize.

844
00:34:32.734 --> 00:34:34.233
I know it's hard to believe.

845
00:34:34.367 --> 00:34:37.667
but it's not sunny
for everyone in Sunflower.

846
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.066
Some of the locals
kids had it tougher

847
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.867
and this place was a
real life saver for them.

848
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.667
They had volunteers running
all kinds of programs.

849
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.100
Activities and sports.
canoes on the lakes.

850
00:34:49.233 --> 00:34:50.333
All kinds of things.

851
00:34:50.467 --> 00:34:51.600
They even had
inspirational speakers

852
00:34:51.734 --> 00:34:53.433
come from around the world.

853
00:34:53.567 --> 00:34:55.834
Entrepreneurs.
scientists. all kinds.

854
00:34:58.166 --> 00:34:59.433
To inspire them
that they could be

855
00:34:59.567 --> 00:35:01.400
whatever they wanted to be.

856
00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:03.433
That sounds really nice.

857
00:35:03.567 --> 00:35:04.600
Exactly.

858
00:35:05.767 --> 00:35:06.934
Yeah. I volunteered here
a few times.

859
00:35:07.066 --> 00:35:08.900
It was so gratifying.

860
00:35:09.033 --> 00:35:10.600
So what happened to it?

861
00:35:10.734 --> 00:35:11.667
Ran out of funding.

862
00:35:13.066 --> 00:35:14.400
It's a shame.

863
00:35:14.533 --> 00:35:16.266
Someone should really revive it.

864
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.533
Come on. let's go.

865
00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.367
The picnic waits for no man!

866
00:35:26.266 --> 00:35:27.567
Okay. Mr. Cynic.

867
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.400
You're going to have
to brace yourself.

868
00:35:29.533 --> 00:35:32.333
These are some excerpts
from Olivia's journal.

869
00:35:32.467 --> 00:35:33.734
Please be advised.

870
00:35:33.867 --> 00:35:35.900
they may contain
romance and emotion.

871
00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:36.800
Okay.

872
00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:38.400
I think I can handle it.

873
00:35:41.633 --> 00:35:44.166
"I have felt such unexpected joy

874
00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.667
in bringing Freddie and Betty
together.

875
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.333
I knew my instincts were right.

876
00:35:48.467 --> 00:35:50.934
They are both people
who deserve each other.

877
00:35:51.066 --> 00:35:53.633
For a moment I wasn't sure
I'd be able to help poor Betty.

878
00:35:53.767 --> 00:35:55.800
But I know I had to try.

879
00:35:55.934 --> 00:35:59.467
And I can't pretend I didn't
enjoy my adventure to New York.

880
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.300
And Freddie's face
when he saw me.

881
00:36:01.433 --> 00:36:04.900
an 80-something year old
showing up at his front door.

882
00:36:05.033 --> 00:36:07.467
It was all worth it
to see them reunite.

883
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.800
And as I walked home.

884
00:36:08.934 --> 00:36:12.367
arm in arm with the love
of my life. Gordon.

885
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.567
I felt a warm inner glow.

886
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.467
knowing now that
there are two less

887
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.967
lonely hearts out there."

888
00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.066
Nice.

889
00:36:21.133 --> 00:36:22.233
Okay.

890
00:36:22.367 --> 00:36:23.633
I think I have a good one.

891
00:36:24.967 --> 00:36:29.700
"Love can be a scary. daunting
and life changing thing.

892
00:36:29.834 --> 00:36:31.367
Not everybody is
brave enough at first

893
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.367
to handle something
that strong.

894
00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.667
But if you can
weather that storm

895
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.033
and let yourself be seen
and be vulnerable.

896
00:36:37.166 --> 00:36:39.066
there is no feeling like it.

897
00:36:40.433 --> 00:36:43.867
A soulmate is one word for it.

898
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.033
But that doesn't
seem to do it justice.

899
00:36:46.166 --> 00:36:48.066
It's sharing mornings.

900
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.400
cleaning up after a
dinner party together.

901
00:36:50.533 --> 00:36:53.300
holding hands in
front of the television.

902
00:36:53.433 --> 00:36:56.166
being truly understood
by another.

903
00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.867
It's having a true friend
to talk to.

904
00:37:00.066 --> 00:37:01.533
A companion to help shield you

905
00:37:01.667 --> 00:37:03.967
from life's trials
and tribulations.

906
00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:08.133
To love and be loved is
the greatest adventure.

907
00:37:10.834 --> 00:37:12.467
We all deserve that.

908
00:37:16.166 --> 00:37:17.967
She really believed
in it all. huh?

909
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.200
She did.

910
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.433
You know. Olivia's own
family told me

911
00:37:23.567 --> 00:37:26.767
that her parents wanted her
to marry the mayor's son.

912
00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.567
But she followed her heart
and married Gordon instead.

913
00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.934
Even though he was unsuitable.

914
00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:35.500
he was the one who made her
truly happy.

915
00:37:36.533 --> 00:37:38.400
That must have
been so difficult.

916
00:37:38.533 --> 00:37:39.900
I think after that happened.

917
00:37:40.033 --> 00:37:42.433
she went out of her way to
avoid those kind of situations.

918
00:37:42.567 --> 00:37:44.767
People missing out
on their soulmates.

919
00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.867
Good for her!

920
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.133
Jury's still out on me. though.

921
00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:52.200
One. I'm not sure about
someone helping love along.

922
00:37:52.333 --> 00:37:53.533
And two. I'm just not convinced

923
00:37:53.667 --> 00:37:55.200
that there's only one person
out there for everyone.

924
00:37:55.333 --> 00:37:57.467
I mean isn't that idea
a little daunting?

925
00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.734
What if you never find them?

926
00:37:59.867 --> 00:38:02.200
I think fate brings
soulmates together.

927
00:38:02.333 --> 00:38:03.934
I feel like it did
for my parents.

928
00:38:04.066 --> 00:38:06.600
I'm sure maybe you feel
that way about yours. too.

929
00:38:09.734 --> 00:38:10.934
What are you writing?

930
00:38:13.066 --> 00:38:14.367
Oh. nothing.

931
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.900
I just jot down notes
every once in a while.

932
00:38:18.233 --> 00:38:19.433
I write a lot.

933
00:38:19.567 --> 00:38:21.200
But I have to do it
in my spare time.

934
00:38:21.333 --> 00:38:22.967
With Patricia keeping me
so busy...

935
00:38:24.133 --> 00:38:25.967
Can I read some of your work?

936
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.633
I don't know.

937
00:38:28.767 --> 00:38:30.767
I'm not sure that
any of it's any good.

938
00:38:32.066 --> 00:38:33.333
Okay.

939
00:38:33.467 --> 00:38:35.000
Well I mean. if you
change your mind

940
00:38:35.133 --> 00:38:36.967
just know that I'd love to.

941
00:38:38.133 --> 00:38:39.100
Thanks.

942
00:38:40.767 --> 00:38:42.000
Okay.

943
00:38:42.133 --> 00:38:46.433
So. you see here...

944
00:38:46.567 --> 00:38:47.967
Jennifer and Michael?

945
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.667
They own a personalized cake
making business in town.

946
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.700
They are the go-to in Sunflower

947
00:38:52.834 --> 00:38:56.433
for all weddings. birthdays.
gender reveals.

948
00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:58.333
You name it. they bake it.

949
00:38:58.467 --> 00:38:59.700
I guess they've
been at this awhile

950
00:38:59.834 --> 00:39:01.266
if they knew Olivia back then.

951
00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.033
Yeah. years and years.

952
00:39:03.166 --> 00:39:05.567
I always wanted one
of their fancy cakes.

953
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.867
but. you've met my mom.

954
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.200
it was homemade in my house.
or nothing at all.

955
00:39:17.867 --> 00:39:19.100
Oh. can I help you?

956
00:39:19.233 --> 00:39:20.400
Hi. I'm Kate Francis.

957
00:39:20.533 --> 00:39:21.767
We spoke on the phone.

958
00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.066
Kate. welcome to
Sunny Smiles Bakery.

959
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.900
We've been expecting you.

960
00:39:27.033 --> 00:39:29.400
I don't know how our paths
haven't crossed before.

961
00:39:29.533 --> 00:39:30.567
I know.

962
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:31.900
I spent most of my
adult life in Seattle.

963
00:39:32.033 --> 00:39:33.066
so I think that's why.

964
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.967
But I'm happy to meet you now.

965
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.734
This is Drew.
he's writing the piece

966
00:39:36.867 --> 00:39:37.734
and I'm his--

967
00:39:37.867 --> 00:39:39.800
Co-writer.
we are both journalists.

968
00:39:39.934 --> 00:39:41.400
It's really lovely to meet you.

969
00:39:41.533 --> 00:39:42.900
You too.

970
00:39:43.033 --> 00:39:45.266
Michael will be back shortly.
he had a delivery to make.

971
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.433
Thanks for coming all this way.

972
00:39:47.567 --> 00:39:48.633
You know. I have to tell you.

973
00:39:48.767 --> 00:39:50.800
we were so thrilled
to hear Olivia

974
00:39:50.934 --> 00:39:52.066
was being honored this way.

975
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.400
We owe everything to her.

976
00:39:54.533 --> 00:39:56.333
Well. that seems to be
a running theme.

977
00:39:56.467 --> 00:39:57.333
Of course!

978
00:39:57.467 --> 00:39:59.734
Right. you two.
Aprons on!

979
00:39:59.867 --> 00:40:01.266
Aprons?

980
00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.000
Will we need aprons?

981
00:40:03.133 --> 00:40:05.100
Itinerary!

982
00:40:05.233 --> 00:40:08.166
Right. what is it this time?

983
00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.967
I thought we could make our
signature sunflower cupcakes.

984
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.100
It's nice and easy.

985
00:40:12.233 --> 00:40:14.567
Vanilla flavored
with buttercream icing.

986
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:15.500
Great.

987
00:40:15.633 --> 00:40:17.266
It sounds perfect.

988
00:40:20.033 --> 00:40:21.400
Here we go.

989
00:40:21.533 --> 00:40:22.900
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

990
00:40:23.033 --> 00:40:25.500
So. it was over 40 years ago.

991
00:40:25.633 --> 00:40:26.800
I'll admit to both of you.

992
00:40:26.934 --> 00:40:29.233
I still feel like
the fool of this story.

993
00:40:29.367 --> 00:40:30.834
Oh not at all. honey.

994
00:40:30.967 --> 00:40:32.934
Michael and I have
actually known each other

995
00:40:33.066 --> 00:40:34.266
since we were babies.

996
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.433
We grew up together.

997
00:40:35.567 --> 00:40:37.333
He lived in the farm next door.

998
00:40:37.467 --> 00:40:39.567
We went from building
treehouses together.

999
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.967
to building science projects
together.

1000
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.600
It was mainly her helping me.

1001
00:40:44.734 --> 00:40:46.000
And boy did I need the help.

1002
00:40:46.133 --> 00:40:48.000
Oh. come on Michael.

1003
00:40:48.133 --> 00:40:52.734
But the long and short of
it is we were inseparable.

1004
00:40:52.867 --> 00:40:55.066
When we got a little bit older.

1005
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.467
it started to feel a little
bit more than friendship.

1006
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.734
At least. I thought so!

1007
00:41:00.867 --> 00:41:03.233
No. I felt exactly the same way.

1008
00:41:03.367 --> 00:41:04.867
I just found it hard to express.

1009
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.033
And I didn't know
she was feeling it too.

1010
00:41:07.166 --> 00:41:08.834
Then came prom.

1011
00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:12.000
Oh prom. the best and
worst part of high school.

1012
00:41:12.133 --> 00:41:14.166
This is the part Michael hates.

1013
00:41:15.266 --> 00:41:16.834
I didn't ask her.

1014
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.533
To the prom. really?

1015
00:41:19.667 --> 00:41:21.233
I completely blew it.

1016
00:41:21.367 --> 00:41:23.533
I was convinced that
Jenny wouldn't accept

1017
00:41:23.667 --> 00:41:26.000
an invite from a friend.

1018
00:41:26.133 --> 00:41:28.834
But I on the other hand.
was devastated.

1019
00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.667
I ended up going
with Stuart Drayton.

1020
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.500
Who was nice enough.
but he wasn't Michael.

1021
00:41:35.633 --> 00:41:36.967
And that was it.

1022
00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.533
What do you mean. that was it?

1023
00:41:39.667 --> 00:41:41.500
You two never talked about
how disappointed you were?

1024
00:41:41.633 --> 00:41:42.967
Much worse.

1025
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.000
I did nothing.

1026
00:41:45.133 --> 00:41:48.467
And we didn't really speak
for a year.

1027
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.533
I thought Jenny was happy
with Stuart.

1028
00:41:50.667 --> 00:41:52.834
I didn't want to come
between them.

1029
00:41:52.967 --> 00:41:55.500
And that's when Olivia came in.
I'm guessing?

1030
00:41:55.633 --> 00:41:56.700
Right on time.

1031
00:41:56.834 --> 00:41:59.233
I was working at the
local diner after school

1032
00:41:59.367 --> 00:42:01.767
when Jenny and Stuart
came in one day

1033
00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:03.233
looking for milkshakes.

1034
00:42:03.367 --> 00:42:04.967
Stuart and I were
going steady by then.

1035
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.300
but I was still holding
out hope for Michael.

1036
00:42:08.433 --> 00:42:09.834
It was all very awkward.

1037
00:42:11.667 --> 00:42:13.400
I watched the them
leave together.

1038
00:42:13.533 --> 00:42:16.900
holding hands. when Olivia
came up to the counter.

1039
00:42:17.033 --> 00:42:19.233
I didn't know who she was
at all at that point.

1040
00:42:19.367 --> 00:42:22.467
And she said. "You're in love
with that girl. aren't you?"

1041
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.367
She just knew.

1042
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.567
And it was at that moment

1043
00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:30.300
that I realized she
was absolutely right.

1044
00:42:30.433 --> 00:42:32.233
I did love Jenny.

1045
00:42:32.367 --> 00:42:34.734
but nobody had ever put it to me
like that before.

1046
00:42:34.867 --> 00:42:36.133
I was heartbroken.

1047
00:42:37.266 --> 00:42:38.900
I felt I'd blown it.

1048
00:42:39.033 --> 00:42:41.233
But not according to Olivia.

1049
00:42:41.367 --> 00:42:43.233
No. she was the one
who convinced me

1050
00:42:43.367 --> 00:42:47.266
to go after you and gave me
the confidence to do it.

1051
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.533
She told me I would
need some grand gesture

1052
00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:54.266
and even then.
nothing was for sure.

1053
00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.100
So. what was the plan?

1054
00:42:56.233 --> 00:42:57.834
Yeah. don't leave us hanging.

1055
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.433
Olivia asked me what
Jenny's favorite thing was.

1056
00:43:02.567 --> 00:43:05.033
That was easy. cupcakes!

1057
00:43:05.166 --> 00:43:08.433
So Olivia invited me
back to her kitchen

1058
00:43:08.567 --> 00:43:10.967
where she herself
helped me bake...

1059
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.100
it must have been
a hundred of them.

1060
00:43:13.233 --> 00:43:15.767
Did any of them look
as good as these?

1061
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.533
Mine were not much better.

1062
00:43:17.667 --> 00:43:19.467
But Olivia fixed them up

1063
00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.500
and I took them down
to our special tree

1064
00:43:21.633 --> 00:43:23.467
down by Sunflower Creek

1065
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.467
and asked Jenny to
meet me there at sunset.

1066
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.033
I was very surprised
with his invitation.

1067
00:43:29.166 --> 00:43:32.700
I had no idea where
he was coming from.

1068
00:43:32.834 --> 00:43:35.467
But I went with my heart
in my throat.

1069
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.033
And when I first arrived.

1070
00:43:39.166 --> 00:43:40.633
I saw him standing there.

1071
00:43:40.767 --> 00:43:43.900
and he was smiling at me
like a puppy dog.

1072
00:43:45.734 --> 00:43:47.033
Then I saw it.

1073
00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:47.867
The cupcakes?

1074
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.467
It was kind of corny.

1075
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:53.467
but I'd carefully set them up to
spell out. "Will you be mine?"

1076
00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.367
And?

1077
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.700
And it was just perfect.

1078
00:43:59.233 --> 00:44:01.433
He told me it had
always been me.

1079
00:44:01.567 --> 00:44:03.266
Always and forever.

1080
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.066
And then we held each other
and I cried and cried.

1081
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.767
I cried too.

1082
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.800
I finally had the girl
of my dreams.

1083
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.900
I have to ask...

1084
00:44:15.033 --> 00:44:17.000
did she give you that sunflower?

1085
00:44:18.567 --> 00:44:20.533
She certainly did!

1086
00:44:30.333 --> 00:44:32.166
Not bad for a small town. right?

1087
00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.500
That is very good.

1088
00:44:33.633 --> 00:44:35.266
It beats some of Seattle's best.

1089
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.333
Right?

1090
00:44:39.467 --> 00:44:41.200
So. one more day of romance

1091
00:44:41.333 --> 00:44:43.166
and you still haven't run away.

1092
00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.667
No.

1093
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.000
I loved Jenny and Michael.

1094
00:44:48.133 --> 00:44:51.100
And you know what?
I think you're right.

1095
00:44:51.233 --> 00:44:54.700
Olivia wasn't just a
busy body. or whatever.

1096
00:44:54.834 --> 00:44:56.533
She really seemed to care.

1097
00:44:57.533 --> 00:44:59.834
It is going to be a great piece.

1098
00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:01.600
[phone buzzing]

1099
00:45:02.567 --> 00:45:04.133
Sorry...

1100
00:45:04.266 --> 00:45:05.266
It's Patricia.

1101
00:45:06.934 --> 00:45:08.900
She needs me to
order 50 candles.

1102
00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.433
Not even going to ask why.

1103
00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:13.834
Got it.

1104
00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:15.800
Sorry about that.

1105
00:45:15.934 --> 00:45:17.266
No.

1106
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.633
Are you always on her clock?

1107
00:45:18.767 --> 00:45:20.300
I didn't sleep
for two whole days

1108
00:45:20.433 --> 00:45:22.266
before her daughter's
fifth birthday.

1109
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.600
Unicorn themed.

1110
00:45:25.033 --> 00:45:26.266
I see.

1111
00:45:28.033 --> 00:45:30.967
So look. I've been thinking.

1112
00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:33.000
It's strange spending
so much time together

1113
00:45:33.133 --> 00:45:35.467
and all I know about you
is your life at City News

1114
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.100
and your dream
of being a writer.

1115
00:45:38.233 --> 00:45:42.100
So. you know. we're
colleagues together now.

1116
00:45:42.233 --> 00:45:44.767
Who knows how long
we'll be stuck together?

1117
00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.433
All right.

1118
00:45:46.567 --> 00:45:48.567
So... quick fire.

1119
00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.934
I get three questions
and so do you.

1120
00:45:50.066 --> 00:45:51.500
Okay.

1121
00:45:51.633 --> 00:45:52.567
Hit me.

1122
00:45:53.967 --> 00:45:55.500
How and why have you managed

1123
00:45:55.633 --> 00:45:58.100
to stay Patricia's assistant
for so long?

1124
00:45:59.633 --> 00:46:01.300
Why would you ask that?

1125
00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:06.166
I mean she doesn't seem like
the easiest boss in the world.

1126
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.133
And it's my question. so...

1127
00:46:08.266 --> 00:46:09.800
Okay. umm...

1128
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.166
When she took me under her wing.

1129
00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.500
she said if I worked very hard.

1130
00:46:14.633 --> 00:46:16.266
she would help me
with my writing.

1131
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.567
So I guess I'm just waiting
for that day to happen.

1132
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.600
Okay. your turn.

1133
00:46:24.266 --> 00:46:28.333
What exactly did you do before
you joined the newspaper?

1134
00:46:28.467 --> 00:46:30.300
Well. you already know
I was a travel writer.

1135
00:46:30.433 --> 00:46:34.066
I had a blog and a bad camera

1136
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.834
and I just went
from country to country.

1137
00:46:36.967 --> 00:46:39.567
Europe. South-East Asia.
you name it.

1138
00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.133
Do you miss it?
The travel?

1139
00:46:43.266 --> 00:46:45.467
Hmm. good question.

1140
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.166
I thought I would.

1141
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.867
But I think I'm finding
that I kind of like

1142
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
not moving around so much.

1143
00:46:54.333 --> 00:46:55.467
Okay. so this one doesn't count

1144
00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.033
as one of my official
questions. okay?

1145
00:46:57.166 --> 00:46:58.166
Okay.

1146
00:46:59.834 --> 00:47:01.834
What do you like
about journalism?

1147
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.567
The people.

1148
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.000
Meeting them...

1149
00:47:11.266 --> 00:47:12.567
really seeing them.

1150
00:47:13.834 --> 00:47:15.867
And then telling
the world about them.

1151
00:47:17.567 --> 00:47:18.967
Okay. favorite ice cream flavor?

1152
00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.633
That's easy. cookies and cream.

1153
00:47:20.767 --> 00:47:21.767
What?

1154
00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:23.567
No. it's all about
mint chocolate chip.

1155
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:24.967
I tell everybody--

1156
00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.400
That's my second favorite.
so I'll give you that one.

1157
00:47:27.533 --> 00:47:29.867
City or countryside?

1158
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.033
Usually I'd say city. but...

1159
00:47:33.233 --> 00:47:35.333
I don't know. you
might just sway me.

1160
00:47:39.033 --> 00:47:40.266
Who's your hero?

1161
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.400
My mom.

1162
00:47:41.533 --> 00:47:43.367
She always puts
the right thing first.

1163
00:47:46.266 --> 00:47:50.567
Okay. last official question.
so you better make it count.

1164
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.667
Oh...

1165
00:47:56.767 --> 00:47:58.900
Why are you so cynical
about love?

1166
00:48:00.333 --> 00:48:01.767
Whoa!

1167
00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.300
No holding back here. huh?

1168
00:48:04.433 --> 00:48:05.633
Honesty only!

1169
00:48:09.233 --> 00:48:11.000
Because of my parents.

1170
00:48:11.133 --> 00:48:14.533
I'm sorry. did they
have an unhappy marriage?

1171
00:48:14.667 --> 00:48:16.300
No. not at all.

1172
00:48:17.467 --> 00:48:20.900
Quite the opposite.
they were the perfect couple.

1173
00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:27.667
My mom used to say how lucky
she was to marry her soulmate.

1174
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:31.700
She uh. she passed away
a couple years back.

1175
00:48:33.166 --> 00:48:34.066
Oh. I'm...

1176
00:48:35.266 --> 00:48:37.934
Drew. I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

1177
00:48:39.266 --> 00:48:40.233
Thank you.

1178
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.467
I mean. it hurt a lot
and I miss her every day.

1179
00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:51.834
But now we just try to
remember the good times.

1180
00:48:51.967 --> 00:48:53.767
And my dad. he...

1181
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.333
he's had a little trouble
filling that void.

1182
00:48:56.467 --> 00:48:59.066
I guess 35 years of marriage
will do that.

1183
00:49:02.033 --> 00:49:03.867
Sounds like they loved
each other.

1184
00:49:05.633 --> 00:49:06.500
They did.

1185
00:49:08.967 --> 00:49:10.934
And I don't know if I'd ever
want to be that vulnerable.

1186
00:49:11.066 --> 00:49:13.567
I mean. all these
stories we've heard:

1187
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.166
very romantic.

1188
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:19.467
But all those ups and downs that
come along with being in love?

1189
00:49:20.967 --> 00:49:23.633
I think I could live a perfectly
happy life without it.

1190
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.533
Has there ever been
anyone that's come close?

1191
00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:32.333
Honestly. no.

1192
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.166
I mean. not really.

1193
00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.800
There's been some people
along the way. but...

1194
00:49:39.567 --> 00:49:40.600
nobody special.

1195
00:49:47.467 --> 00:49:49.000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1196
00:49:49.133 --> 00:49:50.600
Check. please.

1197
00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:53.000
We should get out of here

1198
00:49:53.133 --> 00:49:55.700
and go find you some mint
chocolate chip ice cream.

1199
00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:58.066
Or better yet.
cookies and cream.

1200
00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.000
Right.

1201
00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:20.867
Hey. you.

1202
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.600
Hey. you.

1203
00:50:23.734 --> 00:50:25.700
Just taking some notes
after yesterday.

1204
00:50:25.834 --> 00:50:27.600
I got some voice recordings
from Olivia's family.

1205
00:50:27.734 --> 00:50:29.433
I wrote them up for you.

1206
00:50:29.567 --> 00:50:31.934
Thanks for doing all
that extra work.

1207
00:50:32.066 --> 00:50:34.867
Can I make a wild suggestion?

1208
00:50:35.934 --> 00:50:37.100
Go on...

1209
00:50:37.233 --> 00:50:38.834
It's pretty crazy.

1210
00:50:38.967 --> 00:50:42.133
I don't know if you'll be able
to handle it. but...

1211
00:50:42.266 --> 00:50:43.500
Try me.

1212
00:50:43.633 --> 00:50:46.266
What do you say we
skip the itinerary

1213
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.100
and take the morning off?

1214
00:50:50.667 --> 00:50:51.934
Take the morning off?

1215
00:50:52.066 --> 00:50:53.867
I don't know that
we have time for that.

1216
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.767
Don't you have to write
this thing. anyway?

1217
00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:57.700
No. we've got it under control.

1218
00:50:57.834 --> 00:50:59.333
We've got it under control?

1219
00:50:59.467 --> 00:51:01.333
I feel like one of us does.

1220
00:51:01.467 --> 00:51:04.100
Come on. I want to see this town
from your perspective.

1221
00:51:04.233 --> 00:51:05.266
a hometown girl.

1222
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.367
Honestly?

1223
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.500
Honestly.

1224
00:51:11.467 --> 00:51:13.033
Okay. let's do it.

1225
00:51:13.166 --> 00:51:14.133
Great.

1226
00:51:27.633 --> 00:51:29.033
Okay well. it is official.

1227
00:51:29.166 --> 00:51:31.700
I am terrible at wack-a-mole.

1228
00:51:31.834 --> 00:51:34.233
To think my whole life.
I had no idea.

1229
00:51:34.367 --> 00:51:35.934
But you did win a teddy bear.

1230
00:51:36.066 --> 00:51:39.066
which is kind of the highest
honor in the fairground world.

1231
00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.900
Surely that's like a
goldfish or something.

1232
00:51:42.033 --> 00:51:43.600
But I'll take it.

1233
00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:46.734
So this was your
teenage stomping grounds. huh?

1234
00:51:46.867 --> 00:51:47.767
Yeah!

1235
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.834
We practically came here
every weekend.

1236
00:51:49.967 --> 00:51:52.700
There wasn't much to do in town.
but we always had a blast.

1237
00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.166
And how are you enjoying
your day off?

1238
00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.066
I'm having fun.

1239
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.600
Oh. unscheduled fun?

1240
00:52:01.734 --> 00:52:02.734
If Patricia could see me.

1241
00:52:02.867 --> 00:52:04.900
I'm pretty sure
she'd freak a little bit.

1242
00:52:05.033 --> 00:52:07.300
I'm not usually one
to stray from a plan.

1243
00:52:07.433 --> 00:52:10.133
Yeah. I've kind of noticed that.

1244
00:52:10.266 --> 00:52:11.433
But I mean. if there's one thing

1245
00:52:11.567 --> 00:52:12.967
these last few years
have taught me.

1246
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:15.667
it's that life without
a plan isn't so bad.

1247
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.233
Even if the outcome isn't
always what you expected.

1248
00:52:18.367 --> 00:52:19.800
There's a lot to be said
for going off track.

1249
00:52:19.934 --> 00:52:20.900
It can...

1250
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.734
It can lead to amazing things.

1251
00:52:25.367 --> 00:52:26.233
Shall we sit?

1252
00:52:26.367 --> 00:52:27.367
Yes.

1253
00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.400
So. answer me honestly.

1254
00:52:34.533 --> 00:52:36.533
is journalism what
you really want to do?

1255
00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.200
Wow...

1256
00:52:41.767 --> 00:52:43.767
Well. I love people's stories.

1257
00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.433
I mean there's
nothing better. to me.

1258
00:52:45.567 --> 00:52:47.834
than meeting somebody from a
completely different background

1259
00:52:47.967 --> 00:52:49.734
and completely different life
than myself.

1260
00:52:49.867 --> 00:52:51.734
How they always surprise you.

1261
00:52:51.867 --> 00:52:53.767
And they all have something
valuable to teach.

1262
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.400
Yeah. I agree.

1263
00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:58.734
That doesn't really answer
my question.

1264
00:52:59.934 --> 00:53:02.200
Will you be happy
at Seattle City News?

1265
00:53:02.333 --> 00:53:05.467
With your dad
technically as your boss?

1266
00:53:07.934 --> 00:53:10.667
I'll admit it
wasn't always my plan.

1267
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.900
But you like to go off plan.

1268
00:53:13.033 --> 00:53:14.800
Oh. okay. Touché.

1269
00:53:17.467 --> 00:53:20.834
Awhile back. I was in India.

1270
00:53:20.967 --> 00:53:23.000
I was writing this piece
for this big expat magazine

1271
00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:24.834
they have out there
about this local woman

1272
00:53:24.967 --> 00:53:26.900
who had started this orphanage.

1273
00:53:27.033 --> 00:53:28.000
Nice.

1274
00:53:28.133 --> 00:53:30.533
Yeah. it was just
totally inspiring.

1275
00:53:30.667 --> 00:53:31.800
and it really stuck with me.

1276
00:53:31.934 --> 00:53:33.900
and I thought. you know what?

1277
00:53:34.033 --> 00:53:35.500
I think it's time to go home

1278
00:53:35.633 --> 00:53:40.033
and maybe try to give back to
my own community in some way.

1279
00:53:40.166 --> 00:53:41.567
So I wanted to
come back to Seattle

1280
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.133
and start a non-profit.

1281
00:53:46.033 --> 00:53:47.433
Really. what kind?

1282
00:53:48.934 --> 00:53:50.567
I hadn't quite decided.

1283
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.567
I just knew that coming from
such a privileged background.

1284
00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:55.834
I wanted to set something up
to help those less fortunate.

1285
00:53:57.467 --> 00:54:00.100
Absolutely. that's amazing.

1286
00:54:00.233 --> 00:54:02.066
So why didn't you do it?

1287
00:54:04.667 --> 00:54:06.700
Things kind of changed
when my mom got sick.

1288
00:54:06.834 --> 00:54:08.633
My priorities changed and...

1289
00:54:10.033 --> 00:54:12.567
My dad really needed
both my brother and I.

1290
00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:14.967
He always wanted us to join
the company at some point.

1291
00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:17.633
I mean. we own two of
the city's biggest papers.

1292
00:54:18.667 --> 00:54:22.100
I think he kind of wants me
to take over soon.

1293
00:54:22.233 --> 00:54:25.800
That's amazing. just in
a completely different way.

1294
00:54:25.934 --> 00:54:28.066
Yeah. you know...

1295
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.567
It's what's necessary.

1296
00:54:31.266 --> 00:54:32.567
But I have to ask.

1297
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.433
If you're gonna take over
the company from the top.

1298
00:54:34.567 --> 00:54:37.066
why are you doing
little pieces like this?

1299
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.467
Right?

1300
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.900
I guess it's
just my father's way

1301
00:54:40.033 --> 00:54:42.233
of testing my commitment?

1302
00:54:42.367 --> 00:54:43.567
When I was a travel writer.

1303
00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:45.467
I was jumping from one thing
to the next so quickly.

1304
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.367
country to country. that I think
he just wants to know

1305
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:50.834
that I can see something
through and stay put.

1306
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.200
I can understand that.

1307
00:54:53.333 --> 00:54:54.533
Yeah.

1308
00:54:54.667 --> 00:54:56.600
Plus. I'm pretty sure
he told Patricia

1309
00:54:56.734 --> 00:54:58.600
to give me the least
me assignment possible.

1310
00:54:58.734 --> 00:55:00.767
Just for that extra little kick.

1311
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.100
It hasn't been all bad. has it?

1312
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.700
Going off plan
can be an adventure.

1313
00:55:09.834 --> 00:55:11.800
And so far.
it's been a good one.

1314
00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.133
Okay. crazy idea.

1315
00:55:19.266 --> 00:55:20.033
Another one?

1316
00:55:20.166 --> 00:55:22.767
Let's organize a
big celebration.

1317
00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:23.633
What do you mean?

1318
00:55:23.767 --> 00:55:24.700
Just right here in town.

1319
00:55:24.834 --> 00:55:27.767
A celebration of
Sunflower Valley love.

1320
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.867
So that all the people
can see all the nice things

1321
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.300
Olivia did for everyone.

1322
00:55:31.433 --> 00:55:33.934
I'm sorry. I don't think
I'm hearing you correctly.

1323
00:55:34.066 --> 00:55:37.100
Drew Hutton wants to plan
a party to celebrate romance?

1324
00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:38.367
I'm serious!

1325
00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.600
We can have games
and lots of food. of course.

1326
00:55:40.734 --> 00:55:42.033
We'll invite everyone
that Olivia knew

1327
00:55:42.166 --> 00:55:43.333
and anyone else
who wants to come.

1328
00:55:43.467 --> 00:55:46.367
They can all share
their stories. It'll be fun!

1329
00:55:47.433 --> 00:55:48.533
I don't know...

1330
00:55:48.667 --> 00:55:51.500
I mean. I'd have to ask
Olivia's family

1331
00:55:51.633 --> 00:55:53.367
if she's okay with that first.

1332
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.500
Yeah.

1333
00:55:54.633 --> 00:55:57.100
Well. let's go
ask them together.

1334
00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.367
What? No?

1335
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.433
I thought you'd like this idea.

1336
00:56:04.633 --> 00:56:05.633
I do.

1337
00:56:06.734 --> 00:56:09.033
I just. I don't know.

1338
00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:10.767
Let's give it a go.

1339
00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:11.934
Yeah.

1340
00:56:12.066 --> 00:56:13.533
It's a lot of work
on top of everything.

1341
00:56:13.667 --> 00:56:14.633
Yeah. okay sure.

1342
00:56:17.133 --> 00:56:19.367
I think we have had
enough time off.

1343
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.100
We better go. or we'll be late
for our next appointment.

1344
00:56:22.233 --> 00:56:24.133
Right. Okay. go.

1345
00:56:28.734 --> 00:56:30.433
This is Dean Richard's place.

1346
00:56:30.567 --> 00:56:32.533
He lost his wife of 44 years
a few years ago.

1347
00:56:32.667 --> 00:56:34.667
so he now runs
the farm by himself.

1348
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.333
He saw my ad and couldn't wait
to talk to us about Olivia.

1349
00:56:37.467 --> 00:56:39.367
And he lives here. on
an actual sunflower farm?

1350
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.433
Mmm-hmm.

1351
00:56:40.567 --> 00:56:42.200
It's been in his family
for generations.

1352
00:56:42.333 --> 00:56:43.367
It's great. isn't it?

1353
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.433
Absolutely.

1354
00:56:48.467 --> 00:56:50.166
You must be the two reporters
from Seattle.

1355
00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:51.266
Yes. hi.

1356
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:53.200
I'm Kate Francis and this
is Drew Hutton.

1357
00:56:53.333 --> 00:56:55.033
Welcome to Sunflower Farms.

1358
00:56:55.166 --> 00:56:57.000
I've been expecting you.

1359
00:56:57.133 --> 00:56:59.934
I'm sorry I'm so dirty.
I've been gardening all morning.

1360
00:57:00.133 --> 00:57:02.066
Not at all. it's wonderful
to meet you. Dean.

1361
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.567
Yeah. it's quite the place
you have here.

1362
00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.734
Well. thank you very much.

1363
00:57:05.867 --> 00:57:09.133
So. how about a little
guided tour before we talk?

1364
00:57:09.266 --> 00:57:11.066
Yes please. that
would be amazing!

1365
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.734
Alright.

1366
00:57:12.867 --> 00:57:15.300
This is our newest volunteer.
Tessa.

1367
00:57:15.433 --> 00:57:18.433
Old friend. we ran into
each other in town recently.

1368
00:57:18.567 --> 00:57:20.600
She wanted to help out.
so here she is!

1369
00:57:20.734 --> 00:57:23.000
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you. Tessa.

1370
00:57:23.133 --> 00:57:25.600
Come. I'll show you
our beautiful flowers.

1371
00:57:27.433 --> 00:57:29.433
Wow. very organized.

1372
00:57:29.567 --> 00:57:31.233
Pretty soon you'll
be writing itineraries.

1373
00:57:31.367 --> 00:57:40.867
Okay. let's not get too ahead
of ourselves yet.

1374
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.100
[music plays]

1375
00:57:46.767 --> 00:57:49.000
I miss my beautiful Jane
terribly.

1376
00:57:49.133 --> 00:57:50.834
She was a wonderful woman.

1377
00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.333
I'm sure she was.

1378
00:57:52.467 --> 00:57:54.233
We actually met on a train.

1379
00:57:54.367 --> 00:57:57.467
On a train journey.
how romantic!

1380
00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:58.867
She was on her way to Wisconsin

1381
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.734
and I was on my way back
to Sunflower.

1382
00:58:01.867 --> 00:58:03.633
We were sitting in the same car
next to each other.

1383
00:58:03.767 --> 00:58:06.133
but neither of us said anything.

1384
00:58:06.266 --> 00:58:09.433
We rode in total silence
for the longest time.

1385
00:58:09.567 --> 00:58:13.734
I was just too shy to start
a conversation with her.

1386
00:58:13.867 --> 00:58:15.233
But then suddenly.
the train lurched

1387
00:58:15.367 --> 00:58:18.433
and she spilled her tea
all over me.

1388
00:58:18.567 --> 00:58:20.033
You know. I've actually heard of

1389
00:58:20.166 --> 00:58:21.400
things like that
happening. Dean.

1390
00:58:21.533 --> 00:58:24.300
But tell me. do you think
she did it deliberately

1391
00:58:24.433 --> 00:58:25.367
just to get your attention?

1392
00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:26.633
Umm. excuse me.

1393
00:58:26.767 --> 00:58:28.967
I am sure it was a
perfectly innocent accident.

1394
00:58:29.834 --> 00:58:32.600
I don't know. maybe
it was a bit of both.

1395
00:58:32.734 --> 00:58:34.266
But it got the
conversation started

1396
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.567
and once we got going.
there was no shutting us up.

1397
00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:40.100
Once I looked at her.
I just thought.

1398
00:58:40.233 --> 00:58:44.433
that's it. that's us
for the rest of our lives.

1399
00:58:44.567 --> 00:58:45.734
Soulmates?

1400
00:58:45.867 --> 00:58:47.300
Oh. definitely.

1401
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.734
When we got to her stop.

1402
00:58:50.867 --> 00:58:52.633
she wrote her address
and phone number on a napkin

1403
00:58:52.767 --> 00:58:55.033
and handed it to me.

1404
00:58:55.166 --> 00:58:56.300
So. you got in touch?

1405
00:58:56.433 --> 00:58:57.900
Oh. tt wasn't that easy.

1406
00:58:58.033 --> 00:58:59.967
When I got off the train here.

1407
00:59:00.166 --> 00:59:03.300
I was clutching that napkin.
but a gust of wind caught it

1408
00:59:03.433 --> 00:59:06.867
and blew it onto the tracks.
It was gone.

1409
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:13.166
I just stood there. devastated.
like I had lost her forever.

1410
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:14.266
Oh no!

1411
00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.967
I was heartbroken until Olivia.

1412
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.600
who was a friend of my mother.

1413
00:59:19.734 --> 00:59:21.767
stepped in to rescue me.

1414
00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:23.633
I told her the whole story

1415
00:59:23.767 --> 00:59:27.500
and that Jane.
I didn't even remember

1416
00:59:27.633 --> 00:59:30.633
her last name.
for crying out loud.

1417
00:59:30.767 --> 00:59:34.266
That Jane was a secretary
for a banker

1418
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.767
in some tiny Wisconsin town.

1419
00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:38.700
And then without
even telling me.

1420
00:59:38.834 --> 00:59:40.667
Olivia took it on herself.

1421
00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.000
like some kind of
private investigator

1422
00:59:43.133 --> 00:59:45.367
and she started combing
through pages and pages

1423
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.767
of companies and names.

1424
00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:49.433
She spent hours
on the telephone.

1425
00:59:49.567 --> 00:59:52.133
contacting all kinds
of businessmen and postmen

1426
00:59:52.266 --> 00:59:56.834
all across Wisconsin until
she finally found that bank

1427
00:59:56.967 --> 00:59:59.000
in a tiny town called Cedarburg.

1428
00:59:59.133 --> 01:00:01.133
-That is crazy!
-Yeah.

1429
01:00:01.266 --> 01:00:03.967
She got me the number
of that bank.

1430
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.834
And when I called Jane. she
was delighted to hear from me.

1431
01:00:07.967 --> 01:00:10.800
So we started right in
like we hadn't missed a beat.

1432
01:00:10.934 --> 01:00:12.200
Can you imagine that?

1433
01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:13.266
Wow.

1434
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:16.867
Here. I brought this.

1435
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.800
I thought you might
like to see it.

1436
01:00:20.934 --> 01:00:23.100
That is us on our wedding day.

1437
01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:26.033
Olivia came too.

1438
01:00:26.166 --> 01:00:28.367
She wasn't well. but
she showed up anyway.

1439
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.033
That's the kind of woman
she was.

1440
01:00:31.166 --> 01:00:33.000
Who's this?

1441
01:00:33.133 --> 01:00:34.500
That's our daughter.

1442
01:00:34.633 --> 01:00:36.600
She lives in New York
with my two grandkids.

1443
01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:39.467
Lovely. what's her name?

1444
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.734
Olivia.

1445
01:00:48.066 --> 01:00:49.166
You okay?

1446
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:50.900
Oh yeah. I'm fine.

1447
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.567
So Dean.

1448
01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.600
you think you're
gonna keep the place?

1449
01:01:04.734 --> 01:01:07.567
Sure. I can't imagine letting
it go after all this time.

1450
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.767
You're lucky to have
Tessa here to help you out.

1451
01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.767
She has been a godsend.
and lovely company.

1452
01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.633
Excuse me for asking.
I'm just curious.

1453
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.600
You think you could ever
open the door to love again?

1454
01:01:22.734 --> 01:01:25.900
I think so. if the
right person came along.

1455
01:01:26.033 --> 01:01:29.500
Don't get me wrong. no
one can ever replace my Jane.

1456
01:01:29.633 --> 01:01:31.900
but as Olivia once told me.

1457
01:01:32.033 --> 01:01:34.567
everybody deserves
to love and be loved.

1458
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.867
That was her legacy.
in my opinion.

1459
01:01:38.066 --> 01:01:39.734
Nice meeting you folks.

1460
01:01:39.867 --> 01:01:41.200
Good luck with the article.

1461
01:01:41.333 --> 01:01:43.200
I look forward to reading it
when you're done.

1462
01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:44.734
We'll make sure
to get you a copy.

1463
01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:46.266
-Yeah.
-Thank you for your time.

1464
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.400
You take care now.

1465
01:01:47.533 --> 01:01:48.600
Yeah. you too.

1466
01:02:03.734 --> 01:02:05.100
So that's it. huh?

1467
01:02:05.233 --> 01:02:06.767
No more surprise
horses or bicycles

1468
01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.166
or. I don't know.
hot air balloons?

1469
01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.600
Nope. that's it.

1470
01:02:10.734 --> 01:02:12.834
All you have to do now
is write the article.

1471
01:02:12.967 --> 01:02:14.800
How's that coming. by the way?

1472
01:02:14.934 --> 01:02:16.266
Pretty good.

1473
01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.600
I think I have a good idea
of her life and motivations.

1474
01:02:21.567 --> 01:02:23.800
You okay?

1475
01:02:23.934 --> 01:02:25.233
Yeah.

1476
01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.767
You know what. if
it's all the same to you.

1477
01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:31.600
I think I might take
a little stroll on my own.

1478
01:02:31.734 --> 01:02:33.734
But will you
excuse me at dinner?

1479
01:02:34.934 --> 01:02:36.500
Of course.

1480
01:02:42.233 --> 01:02:45.667
Well. we're sorry Drew couldn't
join us for dinner tonight.

1481
01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.066
Me too. but he was different
after our interview today.

1482
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.166
I think he's got some stuff
to work out.

1483
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.000
He's a pretty complicated guy.

1484
01:02:53.133 --> 01:02:54.567
Sweetheart. it's
been a real treat

1485
01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.333
having you and Drew here
these past few days.

1486
01:02:56.467 --> 01:02:58.066
Your dad and I are
going to miss you.

1487
01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.734
Me too.

1488
01:02:59.867 --> 01:03:01.567
But we still have the weekend.

1489
01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:04.400
I'm sorry that I don't come home
as often as I should.

1490
01:03:04.533 --> 01:03:05.400
I'm just--

1491
01:03:05.533 --> 01:03:06.700
No. we know your job
is important

1492
01:03:06.834 --> 01:03:08.967
and we support anything
you want to pursue.

1493
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.333
Writing has always
been my dream.

1494
01:03:11.467 --> 01:03:14.200
but every time I come back
here to Sunflower.

1495
01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:17.033
I just hate the thought
of being anywhere else.

1496
01:03:17.166 --> 01:03:18.867
This is home.

1497
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.066
You just have to trust
your instincts. honey.

1498
01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.767
It'll all work out.

1499
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.633
I think I'm gonna go out.

1500
01:03:25.767 --> 01:03:27.734
Go for a bike ride
before it gets dark.

1501
01:03:27.867 --> 01:03:29.500
Gonna go find Drew?

1502
01:03:32.133 --> 01:03:34.467
Just want to make sure
he's okay.

1503
01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.767
Go for it.

1504
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.734
Hey.

1505
01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:49.734
Hey.

1506
01:03:51.333 --> 01:03:53.066
Thought I might find you here.

1507
01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.200
You missed my mom's
world famous beef stew!

1508
01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:57.166
Oh. I'm sorry.

1509
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.467
I just have a lot
to think about.

1510
01:04:04.867 --> 01:04:06.333
What are you doing here?

1511
01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.166
I was worried about you.

1512
01:04:13.166 --> 01:04:14.367
You know. meeting Dean

1513
01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.500
just got me thinking
a lot about my dad.

1514
01:04:18.667 --> 01:04:20.300
And everything. really.

1515
01:04:23.433 --> 01:04:27.233
I will admit that Olivia has
had more of an effect on me

1516
01:04:27.367 --> 01:04:28.467
than I expected.

1517
01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.333
That's a good thing. isn't it?

1518
01:04:34.367 --> 01:04:38.900
Seeing Dean in the same position
as my father

1519
01:04:39.033 --> 01:04:42.200
and just being so positive
about all of it.

1520
01:04:44.533 --> 01:04:47.433
It really gave me hope
that maybe my dad

1521
01:04:47.567 --> 01:04:49.667
will find another
special someone.

1522
01:04:51.667 --> 01:04:52.867
He deserves that.

1523
01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.734
It's so nice to hear you
say that.

1524
01:05:01.467 --> 01:05:03.900
I've also been thinking
a lot about my own life.

1525
01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:11.767
I've spent years closing myself
off from being vulnerable.

1526
01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:15.433
and that seems
really stupid now.

1527
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.333
Because what I was
actually doing

1528
01:05:18.467 --> 01:05:21.467
was closing myself off
from really living.

1529
01:05:24.734 --> 01:05:28.400
I think that maybe love
is worth that risk.

1530
01:05:32.633 --> 01:05:33.900
I think so.

1531
01:05:35.967 --> 01:05:39.166
I was the same.
hiding behind work.

1532
01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.166
never putting myself out there.

1533
01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.467
always thinking
my Prince Charming

1534
01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.567
was going to come find me.

1535
01:05:46.767 --> 01:05:49.800
But I learned
three things this week.

1536
01:05:49.934 --> 01:05:51.433
I'm ready to write.

1537
01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:55.633
I'm ready to find love again.

1538
01:05:57.567 --> 01:05:59.600
And there's no Olivia
to help me.

1539
01:06:03.633 --> 01:06:05.000
[phone buzzing]

1540
01:06:11.233 --> 01:06:12.600
Sorry. that's my mom.

1541
01:06:12.734 --> 01:06:15.066
she's checking to
make sure I found you.

1542
01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.500
I think she likes you better
than she likes me.

1543
01:06:18.667 --> 01:06:20.633
Wait. your mom texts?

1544
01:06:21.667 --> 01:06:23.734
Oh yeah. she's sharp.

1545
01:06:23.867 --> 01:06:26.667
She saved you some leftovers.
by the way.

1546
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.533
Good. because I
am starving. so...

1547
01:06:31.033 --> 01:06:32.166
Let's go.

1548
01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:34.200
Hey...

1549
01:06:39.066 --> 01:06:40.133
I hear you.

1550
01:06:52.033 --> 01:06:53.233
Hey Joe.

1551
01:06:54.233 --> 01:06:56.200
You need a hand?

1552
01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.533
I don't know.
you any good at splitting wood?

1553
01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:01.266
I'll give it a fair shot.

1554
01:07:03.767 --> 01:07:05.567
-Is that the good one?
-Hope so.

1555
01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.033
Whoa! Not bad!

1556
01:07:11.166 --> 01:07:13.633
-Not bad at all.
-Yeah.

1557
01:07:13.767 --> 01:07:15.100
So. how's the article going?

1558
01:07:15.233 --> 01:07:16.166
It's good.

1559
01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.600
Yeah. we're almost done
actually.

1560
01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:21.667
Kate's been great and
I've learned a lot being here.

1561
01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.633
Olivia. she was quite a woman.
wasn't she?

1562
01:07:24.767 --> 01:07:27.834
Oh. I guess Kate
must've told you. yeah.

1563
01:07:27.967 --> 01:07:29.433
You're too young to have
known her though. right?

1564
01:07:29.567 --> 01:07:30.600
Know her?

1565
01:07:30.734 --> 01:07:32.266
She's the one who
introduced me to Linda.

1566
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.767
She's family!

1567
01:07:34.934 --> 01:07:36.133
She is?

1568
01:07:38.133 --> 01:07:39.467
What do you mean?

1569
01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.934
She's Kate's great grandmother!

1570
01:07:42.066 --> 01:07:43.700
She didn't tell you that?

1571
01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:46.233
No.

1572
01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.967
No. I guess she forgot
to mention that part.

1573
01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:53.967
What's so special about her?

1574
01:07:56.667 --> 01:07:58.700
You know what. why
don't you wait and see?

1575
01:07:58.834 --> 01:08:00.834
The article comes out
in a couple of days.

1576
01:08:00.967 --> 01:08:02.433
Alright. I'll do that.

1577
01:08:04.533 --> 01:08:05.633
By the way...

1578
01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.867
I haven't seen my daughter
this happy in quite some time.

1579
01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.633
Sunflower seems
to make her happy.

1580
01:08:17.333 --> 01:08:19.767
Well. home is
where the heart is.

1581
01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:22.100
Night. Joe.

1582
01:08:22.233 --> 01:08:23.200
Night. son.

1583
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.100
Now this is something you
can't get in the city.

1584
01:08:34.233 --> 01:08:36.433
Breakfast al fresco
in peace and quiet.

1585
01:08:36.567 --> 01:08:38.600
Well. it was in peace and quiet.

1586
01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:43.433
So. I've got some news.

1587
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:45.200
Yeah?

1588
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.900
I just got off the phone
with Patricia.

1589
01:08:49.033 --> 01:08:50.800
And this piece is
gonna run tomorrow.

1590
01:08:51.867 --> 01:08:53.533
Tomorrow?

1591
01:08:53.667 --> 01:08:55.767
Why? We weren't supposed
to publish until Monday.

1592
01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:57.100
Don't you need more time?

1593
01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:58.433
I don't know why.

1594
01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:00.233
something else got put on
hold at the last minute.

1595
01:09:00.367 --> 01:09:01.300
But look it's okay.

1596
01:09:01.433 --> 01:09:02.834
the piece is practically
written already.

1597
01:09:02.967 --> 01:09:05.467
As long as I have
enough caffeine.

1598
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.500
I should have it ready in time.

1599
01:09:07.633 --> 01:09:09.934
But there is one more thing...

1600
01:09:10.967 --> 01:09:11.900
Yeah?

1601
01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.734
I was helping your dad
chop wood last night.

1602
01:09:14.867 --> 01:09:17.400
and he told me something.

1603
01:09:17.533 --> 01:09:19.867
He said that you guys
are related to Olivia.

1604
01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:26.300
I have been meaning to talk
to you about that and explain.

1605
01:09:26.433 --> 01:09:27.800
Why didn't you tell me?

1606
01:09:27.934 --> 01:09:31.100
I didn't realize just how
personal this was for you.

1607
01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:32.767
I'm sorry.

1608
01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.967
When I originally pitched
the story to Patricia.

1609
01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.967
I didn't want to mention
the family connection.

1610
01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.600
I thought she might
automatically dismiss it

1611
01:09:38.734 --> 01:09:39.767
as being too personal.

1612
01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:41.100
But then when you
got assigned the story

1613
01:09:41.233 --> 01:09:44.266
I thought it was no longer
an issue.

1614
01:09:46.266 --> 01:09:47.934
Are you mad?

1615
01:09:48.066 --> 01:09:51.033
No. I'm not mad.
I was just confused.

1616
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.967
To be honest. it explains why

1617
01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.834
it was just so close to
your heart this whole time.

1618
01:09:57.867 --> 01:10:00.433
I'm sorry. I should
have talked to you about it.

1619
01:10:00.567 --> 01:10:02.166
One day last summer.
I was helping my mom

1620
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.767
clean out rooms
at the lake house

1621
01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:08.333
and we found all these letters
and that journal you and I read.

1622
01:10:08.467 --> 01:10:11.133
And I just couldn't believe it!

1623
01:10:11.266 --> 01:10:14.266
All these precious memories.

1624
01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.567
I couldn't get them off my mind.

1625
01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:22.767
I just knew I had to honor
her stories in some way.

1626
01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:27.333
I wanted people to know
how much she did for others.

1627
01:10:27.467 --> 01:10:29.667
Well. that settles it.
You're writing it.

1628
01:10:30.734 --> 01:10:32.266
-What?
-Yeah.

1629
01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.400
Come on. you can do this okay.

1630
01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:34.667
You know you're a writer.

1631
01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.633
We've got all day.
I'll be right here with you.

1632
01:10:36.767 --> 01:10:37.734
Not an option.

1633
01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:39.400
I told Patricia I wouldn't.

1634
01:10:39.533 --> 01:10:40.266
Come on.

1635
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.333
Patricia just wants to keep you

1636
01:10:41.467 --> 01:10:43.400
doing her kids'
science fair projects.

1637
01:10:43.533 --> 01:10:48.033
It's a nice idea.
but it's not part of the plan.

1638
01:10:49.266 --> 01:10:50.767
My time will come.

1639
01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:58.233
Okay. I mean it's your call.

1640
01:10:58.367 --> 01:11:00.633
Just know that I'm here
for you. alright?

1641
01:11:00.767 --> 01:11:02.500
You can send me
any story ideas you have

1642
01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:05.166
and I really want to help
you build your portfolio.

1643
01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:08.367
When you get back to Seattle.

1644
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.300
I think you should
talk to your dad.

1645
01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:12.734
I mean. sit down
and really talk to him.

1646
01:11:12.867 --> 01:11:15.767
Explore your options for
taking over City News.

1647
01:11:17.767 --> 01:11:19.266
Yeah. maybe I will.

1648
01:11:20.934 --> 01:11:23.133
Okay. I'm going to make us
another pot of coffee.

1649
01:11:23.266 --> 01:11:24.233
Do you want anything
while I'm up?

1650
01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:26.166
To finish the piece?

1651
01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.500
You know what I need?

1652
01:11:28.633 --> 01:11:29.734
Some more of
your mom's brownies.

1653
01:11:29.867 --> 01:11:31.800
Quite a few of them.

1654
01:11:31.934 --> 01:11:33.667
Okay. you got it.

1655
01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:34.900
Be right back.

Ready to submit?

1658
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.033
I think so.

1659
01:12:03.166 --> 01:12:04.533
It's going to be great.

1660
01:12:04.667 --> 01:12:06.367
You did an amazing job.

1661
01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.033
I couldn't have
done it without you.

1662
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.700
And you know what.

1663
01:12:10.834 --> 01:12:13.266
since we're here for longer
with nothing to do.

1664
01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.633
What about that
Sunflower Festival?

1665
01:12:15.767 --> 01:12:17.033
I knew you'd come around!

1666
01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:18.300
Yes. definitely.

1667
01:12:19.834 --> 01:12:21.433
First thing tomorrow we start
putting together ideas. yeah?

1668
01:12:21.567 --> 01:12:22.700
Yeah.

1669
01:12:22.834 --> 01:12:25.200
Alright. I am going to
tuck in for the night.

1670
01:12:25.333 --> 01:12:27.400
I can't believe when we wake up
Olivia will be out there.

1671
01:12:27.533 --> 01:12:28.967
for the whole world to see.

1672
01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.033
Yeah.

1673
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.500
-Good night.
-Yeah.

1674
01:12:44.266 --> 01:12:45.567
Here goes nothing.

1675
01:12:55.166 --> 01:12:56.800
Publication day!

01:13:10.266 --> 01:13:12.300
Hey. what's going on?

1678
01:13:12.433 --> 01:13:13.700
Sorry. I know.

1679
01:13:13.834 --> 01:13:15.867
I was so excited.
I couldn't sleep.

1680
01:13:16.834 --> 01:13:18.133
So what do you think?

1681
01:13:18.266 --> 01:13:20.266
It took awhile. but I
think Drew finally got it

1682
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.000
and I know he wrote
a beautiful piece.

1683
01:13:22.133 --> 01:13:23.800
I'm sure he did.

1684
01:13:23.934 --> 01:13:25.700
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

1685
01:13:31.233 --> 01:13:33.200
This is your day. Great Grandma.

1686
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.433
Come on!

1687
01:13:55.734 --> 01:13:56.767
Oh no...

1688
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.233
No. no. no!

1689
01:14:03.367 --> 01:14:04.900
Drew?

1690
01:14:05.033 --> 01:14:06.066
I can explain. okay?

1691
01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.700
There was a mistake.
this is my article.

1692
01:14:07.834 --> 01:14:08.834
We have to call the printers.

1693
01:14:08.967 --> 01:14:10.066
It's not a mistake.

1694
01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.000
I submitted your draft
last night.

1695
01:14:13.133 --> 01:14:15.000
I. I don't understand...

1696
01:14:15.133 --> 01:14:17.333
Look. I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

1697
01:14:17.467 --> 01:14:18.533
But you left it behind
on the veranda

1698
01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:21.667
and when I read it.
I was blown away.

1699
01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.166
It was so much
better than anything

1700
01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:24.367
I could have ever written.

1701
01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:26.367
No surprise. because it came
from your heart.

1702
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.500
This had to be your story.

1703
01:14:29.967 --> 01:14:31.867
I don't know what to say.

1704
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.767
Patricia must be furious.
I'm going to lose my job.

1705
01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.266
No. no.

1706
01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.500
I'm not going to
let that happen.

1707
01:14:37.633 --> 01:14:39.033
She can't do that
without just cause.

1708
01:14:39.166 --> 01:14:41.734
Besides your work.
it speaks for itself.

1709
01:14:41.867 --> 01:14:43.834
I appreciate you
being so supportive.

1710
01:14:43.967 --> 01:14:47.033
I do. but you
shouldn't have done this.

1711
01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:49.500
And I flat out refuse
to use your family ties

1712
01:14:49.633 --> 01:14:51.066
to justify a
breach of confidence.

1713
01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.734
I'm not doing that.

1714
01:14:52.867 --> 01:14:54.900
I just felt that your work
needed to be heard.

1715
01:14:55.033 --> 01:14:56.900
Look. the paper
wanted this story

1716
01:14:57.033 --> 01:14:58.400
and it was your story to tell.

1717
01:14:58.533 --> 01:15:00.400
regardless of
what Patricia says.

1718
01:15:00.533 --> 01:15:02.900
I mean Kate. this
is your dream. okay?

1719
01:15:03.033 --> 01:15:05.033
You deserve to have
it start right now.

1720
01:15:06.467 --> 01:15:10.667
Okay. without my consent
you gave me a promotion.

1721
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:14.166
But let's talk about you
for a second. okay?

1722
01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.266
You are avoiding making
changes in your life.

1723
01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.233
You clearly don't want
to run your dad's paper.

1724
01:15:18.367 --> 01:15:20.233
but here you are.

1725
01:15:20.367 --> 01:15:24.100
I would never make those
kinds of decisions for you.

1726
01:15:26.867 --> 01:15:29.400
Yeah okay. I guess you're right.

1727
01:15:33.467 --> 01:15:35.000
I hope you can forgive me.

1728
01:15:36.033 --> 01:15:37.767
Good luck with everything.

1729
01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.667
There's a plane later tonight

1730
01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.934
and if you leave now.
you'll definitely catch it.

1731
01:15:42.066 --> 01:15:43.667
You don't know Patricia
like I do.

1732
01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.233
Maybe you should go.

1733
01:15:46.633 --> 01:15:48.266
I'm gonna go. good bye.

1734
01:15:51.266 --> 01:15:53.100
[phone ringing]

1735
01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.567
Here goes nothing.

1736
01:16:08.367 --> 01:16:10.000
Patricia. I can
explain everything.

1737
01:16:10.133 --> 01:16:12.033
Kate. I thought it
was a clerical error.

1738
01:16:12.166 --> 01:16:13.567
But I asked Drew

1739
01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:15.567
and he told me that this article
was written entirely by you.

1740
01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:16.734
and you alone.

1741
01:16:16.867 --> 01:16:18.734
He approved it going to print.

1742
01:16:18.867 --> 01:16:21.734
I promise I did not
mean for this to happen.

1743
01:16:21.867 --> 01:16:24.166
I wrote kind of a mock piece.
just for fun.

1744
01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:27.000
I left it lying around.
Drew found it...

1745
01:16:27.133 --> 01:16:28.400
I can call the printers.

1746
01:16:28.533 --> 01:16:30.166
Well. I'm glad to hear
that you and Drew

1747
01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.633
are having such a good time.

1748
01:16:31.767 --> 01:16:33.834
Kate. you know it's too late.

1749
01:16:33.967 --> 01:16:35.066
Five hundred thousand copies

1750
01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.600
have just been distributed
across the city.

1751
01:16:40.033 --> 01:16:41.467
The truth is...

1752
01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.333
This is one of
the best pieces of writing

1753
01:16:44.467 --> 01:16:46.266
I've read in my time here.

1754
01:16:47.834 --> 01:16:49.300
What. really?

1755
01:16:49.433 --> 01:16:50.834
Really.

1756
01:16:50.967 --> 01:16:55.700
It's sweet. authentic.
witty. compelling.

1757
01:16:55.834 --> 01:16:58.000
You have a unique voice.

1758
01:16:58.133 --> 01:17:00.767
I have to say.
I underestimated you.

1759
01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.633
And maybe this should've
happened a lot sooner.

1760
01:17:03.767 --> 01:17:05.467
But that still
doesn't change the fact

1761
01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.266
that you were told
strictly not to write

1762
01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.200
or to even work on this.

1763
01:17:11.333 --> 01:17:15.066
I'll have a conversation
with Grant Hutton about this.

1764
01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.100
Thank you. Patricia.

1765
01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:18.200
Bye.

1766
01:17:48.166 --> 01:17:50.700
I am just so proud of you.

1767
01:17:50.834 --> 01:17:52.600
That piece brought tears
to my eyes.

1768
01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:54.233
I'm welling up just
thinking about it.

1769
01:17:54.367 --> 01:17:56.033
I had no idea you
could write like that.

1770
01:17:56.166 --> 01:17:59.934
Thank you mom. but I'm worried
I've blown up my career.

1771
01:18:00.133 --> 01:18:01.266
It doesn't matter. baby.

1772
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.633
You have to commit
to what you stand for.

1773
01:18:03.767 --> 01:18:07.467
Just like the great grandmother
you never knew and honored.

1774
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.967
She was our blood.

1775
01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:10.667
Standard bearer of strong.

1776
01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.333
driven women in
the pursuit of love.

1777
01:18:13.467 --> 01:18:15.700
She is why you're here.

1778
01:18:15.834 --> 01:18:17.667
Yeah. you're right.

1779
01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:21.033
I'm just. I feel like I
made a terrible mistake.

1780
01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.400
Drew is gone?

1781
01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:28.667
Oh. honey.

1782
01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.033
I know. I feel awful.

1783
01:18:31.166 --> 01:18:33.266
I was just so shocked.

1784
01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.100
Who knows. this could
be the start of something

1785
01:18:35.233 --> 01:18:36.266
you've always wanted.

1786
01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.867
Olivia was a great promoter
in the idea

1787
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.967
of making lemonade
out of lemons.

1788
01:18:41.667 --> 01:18:44.200
It might feel good not
to be in Patricia's shadow.

1789
01:18:44.333 --> 01:18:46.033
not to be so stifled.

1790
01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.000
You mean unemployed?

1791
01:18:49.133 --> 01:18:52.467
Life is about how you handle
plan B. sweetie.

1792
01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.667
Did Drew tell you that?

1793
01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.867
Maybe.

1794
01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.000
He seems to care
an awful lot about you.

1795
01:19:02.367 --> 01:19:03.433
I'm not sure caring

1796
01:19:03.567 --> 01:19:06.266
is putting someone's career
at risk.

1797
01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:10.367
Well. you know I support you
in everything you do.

1798
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:13.600
But you might want to give
this one a second thought.

1799
01:19:13.734 --> 01:19:14.834
Just saying.

1800
01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.767
So. what is it that you
couldn't tell me on the phone

1801
01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:22.600
or back on the road?

1802
01:19:22.734 --> 01:19:25.433
I wanted to show you
something. dad.

1803
01:19:29.967 --> 01:19:33.500
You brought me all the way out
here to see an old barn?

1804
01:19:33.633 --> 01:19:34.834
Come on. Drew.

1805
01:19:35.734 --> 01:19:37.834
Couldn't you have
emailed me a photo?

1806
01:19:37.967 --> 01:19:40.600
Well yeah dad I could have.
but I wanted to talk to you.

1807
01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:43.633
Alone. you know away
from the business.

1808
01:19:45.633 --> 01:19:48.200
With everything that happened.

1809
01:19:48.333 --> 01:19:50.000
losing mom.

1810
01:19:50.133 --> 01:19:52.667
I haven't been able
to find the right time.

1811
01:19:54.367 --> 01:19:55.333
Okay.

1812
01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.333
You have my
undivided attention.

1813
01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.500
Okay.

1814
01:20:01.633 --> 01:20:04.266
I don't think I can continue
at City News.

1815
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.266
And I really don't think
I can take over the business.

1816
01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.000
Who asked you to?

1817
01:20:09.133 --> 01:20:12.300
Come on. we both know
that was always your hope.

1818
01:20:13.233 --> 01:20:15.033
But. I'm sorry.
it's just not gonna happen.

1819
01:20:15.166 --> 01:20:17.600
I'm just not cut out
for that life.

1820
01:20:17.734 --> 01:20:20.834
You and mom. you raised me
way too independent thinking

1821
01:20:20.967 --> 01:20:23.000
to ever put on a suit
and do a nine to five.

1822
01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.867
And I love you. I really do.

1823
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.600
And I do not resent
our family's success.

1824
01:20:27.734 --> 01:20:30.133
I just want to be my own guy.

1825
01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:36.333
You had to bring me all the way
out here to tell me that?

1826
01:20:36.467 --> 01:20:41.066
Well. you know I've
always had this dream

1827
01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.433
of starting my own
non-profit or something.

1828
01:20:45.033 --> 01:20:46.033
While I was working on this

1829
01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:47.200
human interest piece
for the paper.

1830
01:20:47.333 --> 01:20:48.834
a friend of mine showed me
this old barn

1831
01:20:48.967 --> 01:20:50.800
that used to be
a youth center.

1832
01:20:52.734 --> 01:20:54.600
It was a lifeline for kids
in need

1833
01:20:54.734 --> 01:20:57.633
and it lost its funding.

1834
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.834
I'd love to renovate it
and run it.

1835
01:21:04.967 --> 01:21:06.600
You know. really make
a difference.

1836
01:21:06.734 --> 01:21:09.200
But I don't want to do any
of that without your blessing.

1837
01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:12.900
Okay.

1838
01:21:14.033 --> 01:21:15.400
You know you always
have my blessing

1839
01:21:15.533 --> 01:21:17.433
no matter what you do.

1840
01:21:19.633 --> 01:21:22.166
I think it's a great idea.

1841
01:21:23.633 --> 01:21:24.900
Really?

1842
01:21:25.033 --> 01:21:26.200
And I'm proud of you.

1843
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.200
Your mom would be. too.

1844
01:21:32.066 --> 01:21:33.900
I wasn't expecting that.

1845
01:21:34.033 --> 01:21:35.667
Of course.

1846
01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.767
I just want you and
your brother to be happy.

1847
01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.233
But no more writing?

1848
01:21:40.367 --> 01:21:41.600
Well I mean maybe.

1849
01:21:41.734 --> 01:21:45.233
but I don't know I just want
to try something new.

1850
01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:51.700
Well. to be honest.
I'm not surprised.

1851
01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:56.500
You were always a bit more
of a free spirit

1852
01:21:56.633 --> 01:21:59.767
from the time you were a kid
and wore mismatched socks.

1853
01:22:01.367 --> 01:22:02.600
But why here?

1854
01:22:04.633 --> 01:22:06.400
I don't know.

1855
01:22:06.533 --> 01:22:08.300
I don't think I can explain it.

1856
01:22:09.333 --> 01:22:11.767
I just really fell in love
with this place.

1857
01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:15.433
I see.

1858
01:22:16.767 --> 01:22:18.000
When can I meet her?

1859
01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.066
What are we doing
at the Lake House?

1860
01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.300
Your dad and I wanted
to show you something.

1861
01:22:30.433 --> 01:22:31.333
What?

1862
01:22:31.467 --> 01:22:33.300
Just come on in for a minute.

1863
01:22:33.433 --> 01:22:34.300
Okay.

1864
01:22:35.867 --> 01:22:37.633
Surprise!

1865
01:22:37.767 --> 01:22:40.100
[clapping]

1866
01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.133
Did you do this?

1867
01:22:47.266 --> 01:22:48.333
Hi. Kate.

1868
01:22:48.467 --> 01:22:50.333
It's nice to meet you.

1869
01:22:50.467 --> 01:22:53.300
Mr. Hutton.
it's nice to meet you too.

1870
01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:58.367
May I ask what are you doing
all the way out here?

1871
01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.934
I guess I'm here on business.

1872
01:23:01.066 --> 01:23:02.934
I read your article.

1873
01:23:03.066 --> 01:23:04.734
Did you come to
fire me in person?

1874
01:23:04.867 --> 01:23:06.467
Fire you? No.

1875
01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.533
I came to offer you a new job.

1876
01:23:08.667 --> 01:23:11.700
Your article. I have
to say it was quite something.

1877
01:23:11.834 --> 01:23:13.266
Apparently. we've been
getting emails all morning

1878
01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:14.900
from people wanting more.

1879
01:23:15.033 --> 01:23:15.900
Really?

1880
01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:17.433
Absolutely.

1881
01:23:17.567 --> 01:23:21.100
So I've asked Patricia to
make it a monthly feature.

1882
01:23:21.233 --> 01:23:22.600
A series. if you will.

1883
01:23:22.734 --> 01:23:25.400
The Love Stories
of Sunflower Valley.

1884
01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:26.633
What do you say?

1885
01:23:28.367 --> 01:23:29.433
Sure.

1886
01:23:29.567 --> 01:23:30.567
I mean. yes!

1887
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.066
Thank you.

1888
01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:35.200
Alright then. we'll discuss
the details later.

1889
01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:37.367
There's somebody who
wants to talk to you.

1890
01:23:45.533 --> 01:23:46.700
Hey you.

1891
01:23:46.834 --> 01:23:48.233
Hey you.

1892
01:23:48.367 --> 01:23:50.000
You look so beautiful.

1893
01:23:52.166 --> 01:23:54.967
Alright everyone. we have
food and drink over here.

1894
01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:57.333
follow me and we
have games. too.

1895
01:23:58.233 --> 01:24:00.066
Wait til you see all of this.

1896
01:24:07.433 --> 01:24:08.734
You came back?

1897
01:24:09.834 --> 01:24:11.767
Well actually. I never left.

1898
01:24:15.333 --> 01:24:17.033
Take a walk with me?

1899
01:24:25.233 --> 01:24:28.767
So. I spoke to your parents

1900
01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:31.166
and we decided to plan
a little something

1901
01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:34.467
to honor Olivia and Sunflower.
and you.

1902
01:24:35.633 --> 01:24:37.800
Just like we talked about.

1903
01:24:37.934 --> 01:24:41.266
Maybe something that can be
repeated for years to come.

1904
01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.133
It's perfect.

1905
01:24:43.266 --> 01:24:44.867
And everybody's here.

1906
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.533
I love it!

1907
01:24:46.667 --> 01:24:49.133
Yeah. there's even
a Sunny Smiles cake

1908
01:24:49.266 --> 01:24:51.166
up there for you.

1909
01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.700
And I don't know if you noticed.

1910
01:24:53.834 --> 01:24:55.467
but I took a page
out of Olivia's book.

1911
01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.633
And encouraged Dean
to bring Tessa.

1912
01:24:57.767 --> 01:25:00.700
That Sunflower Valley
magic is working.

1913
01:25:00.834 --> 01:25:03.700
And maybe on more
than just them.

1914
01:25:06.834 --> 01:25:08.300
Who would have thunk it?

1915
01:25:11.533 --> 01:25:13.567
Listen. I wanted
to apologize to you

1916
01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:16.166
for what I said last time
we saw each other.

1917
01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.700
Don't worry about it.

1918
01:25:17.834 --> 01:25:21.433
No. you did what you did for me
and you didn't deserve that.

1919
01:25:23.367 --> 01:25:26.400
I apologize for taking
such a huge risk.

1920
01:25:26.533 --> 01:25:29.667
but I mean I was only doing it
because I believe in you.

1921
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:30.867
And uh...

1922
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.433
There's one more thing.

1923
01:25:38.567 --> 01:25:43.300
Kate. you know what a huge cynic
I was before I met you.

1924
01:25:44.867 --> 01:25:47.000
You know before I came here.

1925
01:25:47.133 --> 01:25:48.200
Just a little.

1926
01:25:50.033 --> 01:25:51.033
But you...

1927
01:25:52.867 --> 01:25:54.367
You changed everything.

1928
01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:00.100
You're talented and beautiful.

1929
01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:02.500
You make me laugh.

1930
01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:06.100
You question me.
and challenge me.

1931
01:26:06.233 --> 01:26:08.433
Heck. you even spill coffee
on my white shirts.

1932
01:26:08.567 --> 01:26:10.600
Not intentionally.

1933
01:26:15.934 --> 01:26:18.867
I honestly didn't know I could
feel this way about somebody.

1934
01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:22.767
Me too.
