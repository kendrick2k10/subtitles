00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.200
- Hey Mom.

4
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.600
- Hey.

5
00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.439
How's your book coming along?

6
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.560
- It's coming great.

7
00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:36.079
I’m almost done. actually.

8
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.319
I'm gonna see if I can get it published when I finish.

9
00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.079
- Well. that'll be exciting.

10
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Fingers crossed.

11
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.479
- Have you heard anything from Auntie Melissa?

12
00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.079
- Uh. no.

13
00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:50.959
No. I haven't.

14
00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.720
I tried reaching out to her but she still doesn't
wanna talk to me.

15
00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:58.600
- Mom.

16
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.439
is everything all right?

17
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.600
- Yeah. sweetie. everything's fine.
- Seriously. what's going on?

18
00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.400
- I told you. it's nothing.

19
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.879
- Mom. don't lie to me.

20
00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:12.759
- If you really wanna know.
I'm meeting with Mr. Big.

21
00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:13.560
- La'Marr?

22
00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.560
- Yes. Brittney. I need to finish what I started.

23
00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.680
- What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
- No. absolutely not!

24
00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.519
- Please. Mom.
- No!

25
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.800
- Please. I don't want you to go by yourself.
- I can handle myself.

26
00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.200
I don't want you getting caught up in this mess.

27
00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.280
Right now.

28
00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.039
I need you to stay put.

29
00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.839
Do you understand me?

30
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.039
In the meantime.

31
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.280
I want you to clean up this house.

32
00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:48.959
It's your birthday tomorrow.

33
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.360
- Okay.

34
00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.280
Fine. all right.

35
00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.879
- Thank you.

36
00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.039
I will be back.

37
00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.720
I promise.

38
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.000
I love you.

39
00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.239
- I love you too. Mom.

40
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.720
- Mom. Mom!

41
00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:30.439
No!

42
00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.839
- Yeah. that's what the fuck you get.

43
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.479
- Look who it is.

44
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.159
- What's up. Big?

45
00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:25.479
- Where's Reese?

46
00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:29.439
- Oh he was here. he had to leave
to take care of business.

47
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.920
- Seriously.

48
00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:33.759
why do you want me?

49
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.319
- Look. he left you a letter.

50
00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:40.639
- A letter?

51
00:08:42.119 --> 00:08:43.519
What the fuck is this?

52
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.600
He coulda called me.

53
00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:47.560
- You know how Reese is.

54
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.720
- Hey!

55
00:08:58.479 --> 00:08:59.879
What the hell you think you're doing?

56
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.879
Come with me.
- I just...

57
00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:03.800
- Come with me.

58
00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:04.839
- No.

59
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.319
- What?

60
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.239
- I have some business to take care of.

61
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.879
- Hey boss. look who I found spying on us.

62
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:21.959
- Brittney?

63
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.959
You really thought you could just
sneak up on us. huh?

64
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.000
You know what. I'm gonna end this now.
- You murderer.

65
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.360
- Funny you'd mention that.

66
00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:33.639
I wasn’t…

67
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.920
- Police. hands. hands!

68
00:09:40.239 --> 00:09:41.000
Hands up.

69
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.319
Now!

70
00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:43.920
Hands up where I can see 'em.
- Clever.

71
00:09:54.319 --> 00:09:55.759
- Hands behind your head!

72
00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:01.039
- Turn around.

73
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.200
- Why didn't they kill him?

74
00:11:55.759 --> 00:11:56.959
- You actually bought a gift?

75
00:11:57.119 --> 00:11:59.000
- Yeah. of course I did.
- What'd you get?

76
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.920
- Got her some books by her favorite author. actually.

77
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200
- That was sweet of you.

78
00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.720
I know she'll love them.

79
00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:06.000
- Thank you. Alex.

80
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560
What'd you get her. Dre?

81
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.319
- I didn't buy her a damn thing.

82
00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:11.159
- Babe.

83
00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:12.039
- What?

84
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.600
- I thought you said you got her something.

85
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.039
- Why the hell would I waste my money?

86
00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:16.639
I mean especially if she may not show up.

87
00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:19.720
- Dude. she'll be there. okay.

88
00:12:20.119 --> 00:12:22.360
- John. you said that last time and she wasn't there.

89
00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:23.920
Goodness man.

90
00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:27.280
as of late I just can't deal with her.
- You. you be nice.

91
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.680
- Seriously. okay.

92
00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:30.759
You know what she's been going through

93
00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:33.239
and we need to be there for her.

94
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.159
- You know. my patience is just wearing real thin.

95
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.680
- Of course it is.

96
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.680
- Okay. let's just go there.

97
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.879
Let's see what happens.
- I agree with Alex.

98
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.159
All right. it'd be good for all of us to see her.

99
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.200
- Yeah. if she shows up.

100
00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:46.560
- Shut up. Dre.

101
00:12:48.239 --> 00:12:49.400
- I'm surprised you could hear me.

102
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.519
- It's not like you know how to whisper.

103
00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:53.720
Let's go.

104
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.039
- It's a bunch of gangsters.

105
00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:32.479
- It seems like it is. but.

106
00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:47.879
- All rise.

107
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.079
The Honorable Judge Jamie presiding.

108
00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:53.479
- Good morning. ladies and gentlemen.

109
00:13:54.439 --> 00:13:55.800
Are all parties present?

110
00:13:56.479 --> 00:13:58.280
- Yes. your honor.
- You may be seated.

111
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.280
- Go ahead.

112
00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:08.000
- Mr. Watkins.

113
00:14:08.439 --> 00:14:10.680
where were you the night
Douglas Hayes was murdered?

114
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.159
- I was at home

115
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.239
watching old black and white movies.

116
00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:17.479
- Interesting.

117
00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:20.839
so you and your organization
weren't behind the West Lake murder?

118
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.959
- Nah. I did not commit those crimes.

119
00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:30.159
- Quiet everyone.

120
00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:33.479
You may continue.

121
00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:35.519
- Mr. Watkins.

122
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.000
we have footage that looks
a lot like you and your team

123
00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:42.800
killing Douglas...
- Excuse me!

124
00:14:43.239 --> 00:14:47.479
There is no evidence that proves
that Mr. Watkins is behind the murder.

125
00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:50.479
In fact. the footage we received

126
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:52.639
shows that it could be any number of gangs

127
00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.600
that are popping up around the city.
- Lower your volume and have a seat.

128
00:15:00.319 --> 00:15:04.639
- Those are the gangs you should be after. Your honor.

129
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.479
- Everyone quiet. please.

130
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.239
Quiet. please.

131
00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:27.959
This case will reconvene next Tuesday.

132
00:15:28.159 --> 00:15:32.800
La'Marr Watkins. you will remain in the county jail
until then without bail.

133
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.239
Court adjourned.

134
00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:15.639
- I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen.

135
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.119
No. I frickin told you guys.

136
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.400
I knew she wasn't gonna come.

137
00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:21.759
It's such a waste.

138
00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:25.959
- Dre. can you for once in your life just be nice.

139
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.839
- No. I'm tired of dealing with this bullshit.

140
00:16:28.119 --> 00:16:30.759
- Let's just wait a few extra minutes.
- What?

141
00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:33.280
Dude. we've been here for an hour
and I haven't even ordered yet.

142
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.959
All I've got is this nasty ass water
that tastes like shit.

143
00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:38.519
I asked'em for two lemons and they only gave me one.

144
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.759
I mean. how do you mess up on that?
- Dre!

145
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.400
- Like. how do you do that?
- Calm down.

146
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.639
- John. did you actually talk to her?

147
00:16:46.119 --> 00:16:48.200
- Yeah. I did actually. earlier today

148
00:16:48.479 --> 00:16:50.119
when she told me that she was gonna come.

149
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.200
- Yeah. well obviously that was a lie.

150
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.519
- Look who it is.

151
00:16:54.479 --> 00:16:55.959
- Sorry I'm late. you guys.

152
00:16:58.079 --> 00:16:59.639
- It's fine we were just getting ready to order.
- Yeah.

153
00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:01.879
- Let me take a look at the menu.

154
00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:05.039
- I would actually.
I would check out the pizza.

155
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.079
It's actually really good.

156
00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:08.400
- I'm gonna have to try that out.

157
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.600
I really missed you guys.

158
00:17:16.239 --> 00:17:18.000
You guys just don't even understand.

159
00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.519
- I'm glad that you made it.

160
00:17:20.879 --> 00:17:22.839
- It's so good to see you.

161
00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:27.000
So. tell us. how have you been?

162
00:17:31.879 --> 00:17:32.879
- Sorry guys.

163
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.280
- No. no. no. Don't apologize.

164
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.159
It's okay. it's all right.

165
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.560
- I was there today.

166
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.000
- Where?

167
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.920
- Mr. Big's trial.

168
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.280
His case is on hold.
- Hey!

169
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.239
Are you serious?

170
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.639
Can't we all just have a nice lunch together?

171
00:17:56.119 --> 00:17:58.519
Brittney. that man is getting ready to face life in prison.

172
00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.360
I mean what's wrong with...
- Dre!

173
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.720
- Dude. seriously.

174
00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:02.759
- Brittney. don't.
- Shut up.

175
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.200
What the hell is wrong with you?

176
00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:08.319
- Not even two minutes in and this happens.

177
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.360
- You are such an asshole.

178
00:18:14.519 --> 00:18:15.800
- Are you serious?

179
00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:44.959
- Hey. hey. hey. Don't listen to him.
He's just an asshole.

180
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.639
Are you all right?

181
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.319
- I need to go. I just need some time.
- Just stay.

182
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.319
- I just need some time. I'm sorry you guys.

183
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.360
- Put their fingerprints all over the weapons

184
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.479
and then we'll turn them into the police station.

185
00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.000
With the new and overwhelming evidence

186
00:19:14.879 --> 00:19:16.920
they'll be forced to release La'Marr

187
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.039
and put Brittney and her friends away for a long time.

188
00:19:23.519 --> 00:19:25.560
Now. if that doesn't work

189
00:19:26.439 --> 00:19:29.039
we'll have to put plan B into effect.

190
00:19:29.759 --> 00:19:30.720
Understood?

191
00:19:35.959 --> 00:19:37.079
- Really. yo?

192
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.119
Come on.

193
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.759
Mr. Big is locked up.

194
00:19:42.159 --> 00:19:43.479
We could do what we want.

195
00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:46.079
Think about it.

196
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.680
Are we really gonna take orders

197
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.959
from a guy with a corny ass.
Saturday morning cartoon character's name?

198
00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:56.800
- Oh. I don't think Reese would like that
very much now would he?

199
00:19:57.319 --> 00:19:59.600
All right. let me get this straight.

200
00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:02.479
You're trying to tell us

201
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.439
that we should forget about the case

202
00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.600
and let Mr. Big rot in prison.

203
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.680
Is that what you're trying to tell us?

204
00:20:16.839 --> 00:20:17.600
- Yeah.

205
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.680
That's exactly what I'm saying.

206
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.200
- That is what he's telling us.

207
00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:35.400
Anyone else got anything they'd like to add?

208
00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:38.280
I thought not.

209
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.079
All right. time to get a move on.

210
00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:45.239
Let's find Brittney and her friends

211
00:20:45.319 --> 00:20:47.159
and don't forget to retrieve the weapons.

212
00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:49.519
Report everything back to me.

213
00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:52.319
Clock's ticking.

214
00:20:53.159 --> 00:20:53.959
time to work.

215
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.519
- Gotta get going?

216
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.639
- Yeah. I got work in like 15 minutes.

217
00:21:24.079 --> 00:21:27.600
- It's a good thing you work at the beach.
- Yeah. I love it. honestly.

218
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.280
Okay. I'm off to work.

219
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.400
- All right. babe.

220
00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:32.680
Have a good day at work.

221
00:21:35.479 --> 00:21:36.879
- Text me on your break.
- Okay.

222
00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:38.039
See you guys.

223
00:21:38.959 --> 00:21:39.639
Dre.

224
00:21:40.439 --> 00:21:40.920
- Yeah?

225
00:21:41.839 --> 00:21:42.479
- Be nice.

226
00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:45.000
- Fine.

227
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.560
- All right. what's going on?

228
00:22:08.319 --> 00:22:10.159
- Man. it's about what happened earlier.

229
00:22:10.959 --> 00:22:11.759
- What about it?

230
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.560
- I just hate how things went down.

231
00:22:15.239 --> 00:22:16.319
She just didn't deserve that.

232
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.360
- Yeah. I agree.

233
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.920
- We've known Brittney for awhile now.

234
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.920
I just miss how our friendship used to be.

235
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.000
We used to get ourselves into mischief.

236
00:22:28.479 --> 00:22:31.000
Doing things our folks would be mad about.

237
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.800
The best part is.

238
00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:37.319
we didn't have a care in the world.

239
00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.600
Those memories are golden.

240
00:22:42.519 --> 00:22:43.839
But after the incident.

241
00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:45.319
our friendship's been shaken.

242
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.039
It's been worse the past few months.

243
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.680
- Honestly.

244
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.439
we haven't really been the best of friends to her lately.

245
00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:52.800
- I know.

246
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.360
I have something to confess. John.

247
00:22:57.119 --> 00:22:58.119
- What?

248
00:22:59.759 --> 00:23:01.039
- I actually got Brittney a gift.

249
00:23:01.639 --> 00:23:02.239
- What?

250
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.079
Why would you lie about that?
- I didn't wanna get my hopes up

251
00:23:06.079 --> 00:23:07.800
and look like an idiot. John.

252
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.560
- Well you already are one. so it doesn't matter.

253
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.839
- We've got eyes on them.

254
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.159
- Bad ass kids with ugly ass moms.

255
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.360
What you doing. boy?

256
00:23:48.239 --> 00:23:49.920
Excuse me. put that down.

257
00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.079
Put. hey. hey fat ass!

258
00:24:04.879 --> 00:24:05.759
- Stop.

259
00:24:11.239 --> 00:24:12.159
- It's been hard for us all

260
00:24:13.159 --> 00:24:16.280
and it was tragic. what happened.

261
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.039
I can't imagine the pain she feels.

262
00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:21.639
But the only thing we can do right now

263
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.200
is be there for her.

264
00:24:24.119 --> 00:24:25.200
She needs us.

265
00:24:26.959 --> 00:24:28.079
- I'm gonna be better.

266
00:24:28.879 --> 00:24:30.079
I'm gonna make things right. man.

267
00:24:33.239 --> 00:24:36.239
- Hey. do you wanna get outta here?
- Yes. let's go before he notices.

268
00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.680
- Hold up. whoa. hold up.

269
00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:39.000
- Shit.

270
00:24:39.079 --> 00:24:40.680
- I know you two didn't act
like you didn't just see me.

271
00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:43.119
My favorite knuckle heads.

272
00:24:43.439 --> 00:24:44.360
Where's the third one at?

273
00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:46.759
- We tried to throw her a birthday dinner

274
00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:49.119
and. well.
- Didn't go as planned?

275
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.319
I know it was Dre's fault.
- What?

276
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.879
- Yeah. yeah.

277
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.360
- Really?
- Look at you.

278
00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.560
All quiet.

279
00:24:56.759 --> 00:24:59.079
You're usually the first one
to open your big fat mouth.

280
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.439
- But I didn't...
- Shut up.

281
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.319
- All right. just let me...
- You explain. shut up!

282
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.239
I'll slap the fucking shit outta you.

283
00:25:10.079 --> 00:25:11.000
Anyways.

284
00:25:11.439 --> 00:25:12.959
you two gonna be at the Mayor's party tonight?

285
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.079
- The big fancy one the Mayor's hosting?

286
00:25:15.319 --> 00:25:18.479
- Yeah. it's a celebration of all the progress
we've made as a whole.

287
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.839
Brittney should be there.

288
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.680
Dedicated to her as well
for helping us arrest Mr. Big.

289
00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.920
- Interesting. I think we'll have to be there.

290
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.959
What time does it start?

291
00:25:30.519 --> 00:25:32.079
- I think the doors open at 7:30.

292
00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:36.079
- I think we should go.

293
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.079
- Uh. sure.
- You ready?

294
00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:39.720
- Yeah.
- That's a good idea.

295
00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:41.000
Yeah. you be safe.

296
00:25:41.319 --> 00:25:42.519
Go to hell. Dre.

297
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.280
Oh. this fat ass kid is back.

298
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.239
Hey!

299
00:25:51.159 --> 00:25:52.879
I'm gonna send you to Jenny Craig if you don't stop.

300
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.039
- Welcome to the SBN News.

301
00:26:40.319 --> 00:26:41.839
I'm Tonya Williams.

302
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.439
First up. we'll be covering the latest news
about the West Lake murder case.

303
00:26:46.959 --> 00:26:48.119
As you all know.

304
00:26:48.319 --> 00:26:49.479
La'Marr Watkins.

305
00:26:49.839 --> 00:26:55.079
publicly known as Mr. Big. is being accused
of murdering Douglas Hayes.

306
00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.239
The police can't prove that La'Marr's
actually behind the murder

307
00:26:59.479 --> 00:27:01.759
based on the footage that has been provided.

308
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.400
The police are investigating the weapons
that were used during the time of his murder.

309
00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:12.519
The few guns that they have found so far
do not match up to the ones that were used

310
00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.560
to murder Mr. Hayes

311
00:27:15.479 --> 00:27:16.400
- Weapons?

312
00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:35.560
- She's on the move.

313
00:27:48.079 --> 00:27:49.319
- I don't know what I'm gonna wear.

314
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.759
- If I remember correctly
we're supposed to dress up.

315
00:27:53.519 --> 00:27:56.600
- Dude. I hate. no.
- What. what?

316
00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:57.800
- No. I hate dressing up.

317
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.439
- It'll be fine. relax.
All right. this is for Brittney.

318
00:28:01.319 --> 00:28:03.119
- Yeah. you got a point.

319
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.159
- Hey. hey is that the same truck?
- Yes. um. shoot.

320
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.079
Uh. come on. let's go this way.

321
00:28:09.439 --> 00:28:11.519
There's lots of white trucks.
- The truck's here.

322
00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:13.239
I thought I saw something.

323
00:28:13.639 --> 00:28:14.239
- What?

324
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.839
Oh shit.

325
00:28:19.879 --> 00:28:20.920
Hey. Dre!

326
00:28:27.479 --> 00:28:28.920
- No. no. no!

327
00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:42.439
No. what are you doing? I didn't do anything.
I swear to god. I didn't do anything.

328
00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:56.280
- Check the other side of the building.
He didn't get far.

329
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.439
- What?
- Brittney!

330
00:29:23.519 --> 00:29:26.039
Brittney. John. it's John.

331
00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:27.439
- Dre. what's going on?

332
00:29:29.239 --> 00:29:30.079
What about John?

333
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.879
- An SUV was chasing John and I down

334
00:29:32.879 --> 00:29:35.759
and a bunch of men jumped out
and they. they were chasing us.

335
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.800
They got John.

336
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.560
- Dre listen to me.

337
00:29:40.239 --> 00:29:41.680
Get to my house as soon as possible.

338
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.639
- Let go of me!

339
00:30:49.439 --> 00:30:50.119
No.

340
00:30:59.079 --> 00:30:59.839
Jordan?

341
00:31:01.079 --> 00:31:02.680
Wha. what?
- Shh.

342
00:31:08.839 --> 00:31:09.479
- Geno?

343
00:31:10.439 --> 00:31:11.119
Yes.

344
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.079
The job is done.

345
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.239
Don't worry. we did.

346
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.720
We're on our way back.

347
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.759
Don't just stand there.
Help me get him to the bathroom. Come on!

348
00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.560
What. what are you doing?
- Why are you doing this?

349
00:31:35.439 --> 00:31:37.159
- What are you talking about?
- This. Jordan.

350
00:31:37.239 --> 00:31:38.479
Why did you save my life?

351
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.879
- I was just trying to.
- Oh. what the fuck?

352
00:31:42.959 --> 00:31:44.560
- Dre. I can explain.
- What's going on?

353
00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:48.920
Oh god. that's a dead body.
No. no. no. no.

354
00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:51.000
No. we're gonna go to jail.

355
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.759
- No. no.
- I'm gonna. I'm gonna go the jail.

356
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.800
- No.

357
00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.039
- No. no. no. I'm. I'm gonna.
Somebody's gonna make me their bitch!

358
00:32:00.759 --> 00:32:02.200
- No. no. no. They're gonna change my name to Drea.

359
00:32:02.239 --> 00:32:04.639
- Calm down. calm down.
- Calm down?

360
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.039
There's a fucking dead body! Calm down?
- Dre.

361
00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:18.159
- Look. this may sound crazy.

362
00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:21.839
but the lawyer who's always
with Mr. Big is behind this.

363
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.600
Her name is Geno.

364
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:24.879
- Geno?

365
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.519
I haven't heard of her.

366
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.200
- She's devised a plan to capture
and frame you guys for the West Lake murder.

367
00:32:31.119 --> 00:32:32.920
Originally. after this job was done.

368
00:32:33.879 --> 00:32:35.360
we were gonna turn you guys in with the weapons

369
00:32:35.839 --> 00:32:37.680
forcing them to release Mr. Big.

370
00:32:38.079 --> 00:32:40.639
- Well. now they have one of my friends.
How are we gonna get him back?

371
00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.680
- Uh. we need to...
- I know!

372
00:32:43.159 --> 00:32:46.400
I'm gonna get the police involved.
- No! You can't do that.

373
00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.319
- Why not?

374
00:32:47.879 --> 00:32:49.600
- No cop can be trusted.

375
00:32:50.479 --> 00:32:52.280
Most cops are in on Mr. Big's plan.

376
00:32:52.879 --> 00:32:54.079
- This just gets worse.

377
00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.720
- That's why I'm here.

378
00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.680
To help get your friend back.

379
00:32:59.239 --> 00:33:01.879
but more importantly take down Geno and her men.

380
00:33:02.439 --> 00:33:04.039
- Wow. that's great.

381
00:33:04.639 --> 00:33:07.560
But did you think about how the three of us
are gonna take down their army?

382
00:33:07.639 --> 00:33:09.879
- Hey. I think I know somebody who can help us.

383
00:33:16.639 --> 00:33:17.680
- Wait. what?

384
00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:20.039
You gotta be a special type of stupid.

385
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.519
- We have to do this.

386
00:33:23.119 --> 00:33:24.360
It's the only way to make sure.

387
00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:26.360
- Yeah. I know.

388
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.720
So how are we doing it?

389
00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:34.920
- Look. Geno's hideout is
near the downtown area.

390
00:33:35.119 --> 00:33:37.319
- Okay.
- There'll be two guards guarding the door.

391
00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:42.639
We need to somehow create a diversion
so we can go in and take 'em out.

392
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.119
- That's a lot easier said than done.

393
00:33:53.119 --> 00:33:55.200
- I've got a plan.
- Let's hear it.

394
00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.800
- We're gonna grab her.

395
00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.439
- And?

396
00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.639
- We'll capture them.

397
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.479
I'll lead it.

398
00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.959
- I'm in.
- Let's do it.

399
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:30.720
- What?

400
00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:34.680
- Hey. I just wanted to apologize for earlier.

401
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.479
I know I haven't been a good friend.

402
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.879
But I wanted you to know that I'm always here.

403
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.800
I got ya a gift.

404
00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.920
Happy birthday.

405
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.639
I'm gonna go help

406
00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.839
Harold and Jordan.

407
00:35:01.639 --> 00:35:02.560
Okay.

408
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.319
- Damn it. come on.

409
00:36:35.959 --> 00:36:37.000
Call me ASAP.

410
00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.920
- Hey.
- Hey.

411
00:37:00.439 --> 00:37:01.239
- What's going on?

412
00:37:01.959 --> 00:37:03.759
- Nothing. Jordan.

413
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.319
- Come on.

414
00:37:06.479 --> 00:37:07.759
You can tell me what's going on.

415
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.319
- This isn't exactly how I saw this day going.

416
00:37:13.039 --> 00:37:14.879
Especially not the day before my birthday.

417
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.319
I'm reliving the nightmare all over again.

418
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.159
- Um. I.

419
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.879
I understand.
- Do you really?

420
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:33.239
This very day a year ago
I watched my mom's car burst into flames.

421
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.759
She was inside it.

422
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.800
That image is in my mind playing from
the moment I wake up everyday.

423
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.680
My biggest fear is that the man who killed
my mother will be on the streets again.

424
00:37:49.079 --> 00:37:49.800
- Brittney.

425
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.879
I'll do all that I can to prevent that nightmare.

426
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.319
I promise.

427
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.200
We all used to look up to Mr. Big.

428
00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:03.000
He was like a father figure to me.

429
00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.039
It hurt badly when you switched up.

430
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.879
That's why I joined. you know.

431
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.800
To know and understand why.

432
00:38:18.039 --> 00:38:20.360
- We need to get going. Time's not on our side.

433
00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:25.119
Dre. get in the front.

434
00:39:12.479 --> 00:39:13.200
- Ah!

435
00:39:15.639 --> 00:39:16.639
What's going on?

436
00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:20.000
What. who are you guys?

437
00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.079
- Well. hello.

438
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:29.479
You and your friends have something
in your possession that doesn't belong to you.

439
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.119
Mr. Big's weapons.

440
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.879
And tonight. my men

441
00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:41.600
are going to gather up
all your friends and the weapons

442
00:39:41.759 --> 00:39:44.200
and turn you into the police station.
- No. no. no. no. no.

443
00:39:44.239 --> 00:39:46.159
You can't. you can't.
- Oh yes. yes. yes. yes.

444
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.720
And with all your fingerprints
all over the weapons

445
00:39:49.759 --> 00:39:51.800
it'll be enough to convict you of the murder

446
00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:55.560
and put you all away for a long. long time.

447
00:39:57.039 --> 00:40:00.800
- Stop. stop. no. no. no you can't.
- Oh really. we can't?

448
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.839
You dare underestimate us?

449
00:40:05.519 --> 00:40:09.239
Well I assure you. that you and your friends

450
00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:14.920
are in for such a special. special treat tonight.

451
00:40:20.639 --> 00:40:21.920
- Please don't. don't go.

452
00:40:22.159 --> 00:40:25.800
No. no. you can't. no! Hey. hey!

453
00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.800
Come back! Come back!

454
00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:51.839
- Get what we can.

455
00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:53.119
Come on. let's go.

456
00:41:04.159 --> 00:41:05.039
I've got Brittney.

457
00:41:05.439 --> 00:41:07.759
The rest of the stuff's in the car
if you wanna go get it.

458
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.479
- House keeping!

459
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.239
Woo!

460
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.920
Boy. get your ass out of the car.

461
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.319
- Jordan!

462
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.759
Brittney!

463
00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.479
Come out and play.

464
00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:17.079
- Hey boys.

465
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.319
You have to do better than that.

466
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.280
- Plan B. start plan B.

467
00:43:32.239 --> 00:43:32.959
- Geno!

468
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:41.680
- What?

469
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.519
Auntie Melissa?

470
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.280
- Ah. yes. Brittney.

471
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.280
It is. ugh.

472
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.360
- How could you?

473
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.439
Why would you do this to us?

474
00:43:58.159 --> 00:43:59.239
I thought you moved.

475
00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.400
- Uh-uh. oh no. Brittney.

476
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.319
I've been here all along
working with La'Marr.

477
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.519
And guess what. sport?

478
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:07.839
- What?

479
00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:11.000
- Plan B has been put into effect.

480
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.319
- Shit.

481
00:44:13.639 --> 00:44:14.439
- Plan B?

482
00:44:15.079 --> 00:44:17.200
Jordan. what does she mean?

483
00:44:17.759 --> 00:44:20.079
Jordan. tell me what that is. tell me.

484
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.439
- I see he forgot to give you all the details.

485
00:44:24.959 --> 00:44:26.800
Oh boy. are you in for a big surprise.

486
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.920
You see all of the police were in on the plan.

487
00:44:30.479 --> 00:44:33.639
Are releasing Mr. Big as we speak.

488
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:34.639
- What?

489
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
- Uh-huh. uh-huh.

490
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.079
And he's headed to the party that Mayor's hosting.

491
00:44:40.159 --> 00:44:40.600
- No.

492
00:44:40.839 --> 00:44:43.280
- Uh-huh.
- No. no. this can't be.

493
00:44:44.759 --> 00:44:45.920
This can't be happening.

494
00:44:49.159 --> 00:44:53.400
- Now you see that your
pathetic attempts have failed.

495
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.360
- Brittney. I'm so sorry.

496
00:44:59.039 --> 00:45:00.239
- You little saps.

497
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.400
Did you really think you could
prevent this from happening?

498
00:45:05.519 --> 00:45:07.560
Seattle is in big trouble now.

499
00:45:09.839 --> 00:45:11.600
- We need to get the hell out of here. now.

500
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.400
Mr. Big is out. We need to hurry
and beat him to the Mayor's party.

501
00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:17.119
- You're coming with us. Geno.

502
00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.639
- Let's go!

503
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.479
Mr. Big is out.

504
00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.200
I repeat. Mr. Big is out.

505
00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.200
He's heading to the Mayor's party.
We need backup and lots of guns.

506
00:46:57.159 --> 00:47:01.200
- Oh my goodness. this is just gorgeous!

507
00:47:01.479 --> 00:47:03.000
How are you? Hello.

508
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.319
- Right over here. Kim.

509
00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.079
- Oh awesome. thank you so much.

510
00:47:54.439 --> 00:47:56.039
- Can I have everyone's attention please?

511
00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:01.119
Welcome. I'm Jennifer. I'm the executive director
of the Mayor's office

512
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.400
and I have the honor and privilege

513
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.920
to introduce to you.

514
00:48:06.319 --> 00:48:08.839
my best friend and colleague.

515
00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:11.200
We went to Seattle Pacific University together

516
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.479
and I knew even then

517
00:48:14.119 --> 00:48:15.560
that my best friend

518
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.319
was going to make all the difference.

519
00:48:18.879 --> 00:48:20.079
Ladies and gentlemen.

520
00:48:20.479 --> 00:48:23.319
your Mayor. Kim Warren!

521
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.479
- Good evening and welcome.

522
00:48:32.519 --> 00:48:37.560
I’m so glad that you all joined me
and thank you for that wonderful introduction.

523
00:48:38.159 --> 00:48:42.000
In the last year we have reduced gang activities

524
00:48:42.039 --> 00:48:44.680
significantly here in the city of Seattle.

525
00:48:45.479 --> 00:48:48.039
And I want to thank my dear friend Brittney

526
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.800
for all she did into bringing

527
00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:57.200
that notorious Mr. Big.
La'Marr Watkins. to justice.

528
00:48:57.839 --> 00:49:02.400
Again. I thank you for joining us this evening
and please enjoy yourselves.

529
00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:04.519
- Have you got an invitation?

530
00:49:07.839 --> 00:49:10.759
- I'm so proud of you.
You did great.

531
00:49:11.439 --> 00:49:15.119
- I wanna thank you again
for that wonderful introduction.

532
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.319
- Oh your speech was so amazing.
I was so proud.

533
00:49:20.759 --> 00:49:23.639
- They are so wise to pick you as our mayor.

534
00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.079
- Right. I was just telling them.

535
00:49:26.479 --> 00:49:32.560
- You are so special. You guys are
the best friends that anybody could have.

536
00:49:38.319 --> 00:49:40.439
- Well. well. well. We made it.

537
00:49:41.239 --> 00:49:42.759
The party can finally get started.

538
00:49:43.639 --> 00:49:47.439
Oh. how rude of me. Let me introduce myself.

539
00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.600
My name is Mr. Big.

540
00:49:51.159 --> 00:49:52.479
If y'all plan on leaving tonight.

541
00:49:53.119 --> 00:49:54.519
you're gonna do exactly what I say.

542
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:56.759
- Mr. Big?

543
00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.479
How am I supposed to take you seriously...

544
00:50:06.639 --> 00:50:07.479
- Let's see.

545
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.079
Get up!

546
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.400
What's my name?

547
00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.560
- Um. um. Mr. Big.

548
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.319
- So the whole party can hear you.
- Mr. Big!

549
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.360
- Good.

550
00:50:32.759 --> 00:50:33.920
I think everyone's got it.

551
00:50:34.639 --> 00:50:35.319
Sit down.

552
00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:42.680
You!

553
00:50:44.239 --> 00:50:46.319
Turn that camera on and record us live.

554
00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.600
Hurry up!

555
00:50:54.159 --> 00:50:55.079
- You're now live. sir.

556
00:50:55.439 --> 00:50:56.159
- Good.

557
00:50:58.879 --> 00:50:59.920
Hello. Seattle.

558
00:51:00.759 --> 00:51:01.959
Or better yet America

559
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.200
Name's Mr. Big.

560
00:51:06.039 --> 00:51:07.639
I'm currently at the Mayor's party.

561
00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:09.680
Can't you tell?

562
00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.280
We're all having a blast.

563
00:51:14.759 --> 00:51:17.039
We're gonna have even more fun in approximately.

564
00:51:17.639 --> 00:51:20.280
hm. in an hour.

565
00:51:20.639 --> 00:51:23.159
If Seattle doesn't bring me 25 million dollars

566
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.720
to the top of the building in a helicopter.

567
00:51:26.959 --> 00:51:27.720
Oh.

568
00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.560
Wanna know what I mean by having more fun?

569
00:51:35.519 --> 00:51:37.039
I'll be more than happy to show you.

570
00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.159
Get up!
- No.

571
00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.400
Please don't hurt her.

572
00:51:55.839 --> 00:51:56.519
Please.

573
00:51:57.159 --> 00:52:00.319
Take my life instead.
- Ben. what?

574
00:52:01.039 --> 00:52:02.079
No.

575
00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.600
- It's all right.

576
00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.439
- Ben. please.

577
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.920
- I don't want anything to happen to you.

578
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.479
You mean more to me than anything.

579
00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:13.519
I love you. Joyce.

580
00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.639
- I love you.

581
00:52:18.319 --> 00:52:19.879
- Do whatever you want to me.

582
00:52:20.879 --> 00:52:25.000
But please. don't hurt her.

583
00:52:25.879 --> 00:52:27.000
I'm begging you.

584
00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.400
- Wow.

585
00:52:29.439 --> 00:52:30.519
that's touching.

586
00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.560
- Joyce!

587
00:52:48.039 --> 00:52:49.039
- Clock's ticking.

588
00:52:49.519 --> 00:52:51.200
Give me my mother fucking money!

589
00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:57.079
- Oh come on. Dre.

590
00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:06.280
Come on. Dre.

591
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.400
Dre. come on. come on.

592
00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.680
- Police. police. police!
- Drop it!

593
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.239
- Aw.

594
00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.200
so nice of you guys to join us.

595
00:53:23.479 --> 00:53:24.759
Please. have a seat.

596
00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.600
I insist.

597
00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.800
Come on. let's go!

598
00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.439
- Finally.

599
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.319
- Geno. Kolburn?

600
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.319
Nice of you guys to join us.
- Of course.

601
00:53:51.159 --> 00:53:52.360
- You damn traitor.

602
00:53:53.039 --> 00:53:54.639
- Oh. don't tell me you didn't know.

603
00:53:56.879 --> 00:53:59.319
- Thanks for getting me out of that car. Kolburn.

604
00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.039
Wouldn't miss this for the world.

605
00:54:06.319 --> 00:54:07.319
I promise you.

606
00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.200
this party will be remembered.

607
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:18.400
Because we have planted bombs in the building.

608
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.879
And when the time comes

609
00:54:25.519 --> 00:54:26.639
it's gonna explode.

610
00:54:40.519 --> 00:54:42.079
Oh Brittney.

611
00:54:44.079 --> 00:54:45.119
You're coming with me.

612
00:54:47.079 --> 00:54:47.720
Come on.

613
00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:49.600
Get up!

614
00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.479
No one leaves.
- Yes Ma'am.

615
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.600
- No one leaves this place.

616
00:55:04.439 --> 00:55:06.079
- You got it.

617
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.759
- We have less than an hour before the bomb explodes.

618
00:55:20.639 --> 00:55:21.400
- I know.

619
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.560
Don't worry. I'll get us outta here.

620
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.920
- Well. whatever it is. you better hurry up.

621
00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:27.600
- Yeah.

622
00:55:34.479 --> 00:55:35.759
- Sit your ass down.

623
00:55:38.879 --> 00:55:40.039
- Why are you doing this?

624
00:55:42.159 --> 00:55:44.680
- Your mother and a few of her friends
used to do work for me.

625
00:55:46.239 --> 00:55:47.639
They did most of my dirty work.

626
00:55:49.119 --> 00:55:50.920
That all changed after the West Lake murder.

627
00:55:51.439 --> 00:55:54.759
That night we hid all the weapons
that were used at your mom's.

628
00:55:55.959 --> 00:55:56.560
- For what?

629
00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:01.280
- Because your mother was somebody
that nobody would ever suspect.

630
00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:04.959
That next day she decided to leave the organization.

631
00:56:07.439 --> 00:56:08.879
She planned on turning against us.

632
00:56:10.319 --> 00:56:12.680
We had to stop her at all costs.

633
00:56:16.839 --> 00:56:20.560
When you cross me
there are consequences.

634
00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:25.519
- So that's why you killed my mother.
- No Brittney. he didn't kill your mom.

635
00:56:27.319 --> 00:56:28.159
I did.

636
00:56:51.079 --> 00:56:52.239
- Oh come on. Mel.

637
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.119
Come on pick up. pick up. pick up.

638
00:56:56.159 --> 00:56:59.280
Hey. hey. uh Mel. I. I know.

639
00:56:59.639 --> 00:57:01.639
I know. will you just listen to me?

640
00:57:02.039 --> 00:57:04.360
No. you don't really understand what's going on.

641
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.280
No. Mr. Big he's gonna.

642
00:57:07.239 --> 00:57:09.519
No. no. Mel don't hang up on me.

643
00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:13.039
Please don't. don't hang up on me. Don't hang up.
will you. don't hang up!

644
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.079
God damn it!

645
00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.079
- Mom. what's going on?

646
00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.720
Are you okay?

647
00:57:20.759 --> 00:57:21.400
- Uh.

648
00:57:22.479 --> 00:57:27.159
yeah. yeah. It was just a.
it's a little miscommunication.

649
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.159
That's all.

650
00:57:28.519 --> 00:57:29.280
- Mom.

651
00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:32.079
- Hey. hey. hey. hey.

652
00:57:33.839 --> 00:57:34.039
I don't want you to

653
00:57:34.039 --> 00:57:35.720
worry about this. okay?

654
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.879
Why don't you just go back to bed?

655
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.639
- You fucking traitor!
Do you realize what you've done?

656
00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:50.800
- It's Reese on the phone.

657
00:58:53.319 --> 00:58:54.560
- Look. deal with this.

658
00:58:55.439 --> 00:58:56.720
I’ll be back.

659
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:09.239
- You spoiled little shit.

660
00:59:10.639 --> 00:59:12.680
My own sister betrayed me.

661
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.519
- Come on man. time's running out.

662
00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:23.639
- Don't you think I know that?

663
00:59:23.959 --> 00:59:24.600
Hold on.

664
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.000
- I mean. come on.

665
00:59:30.439 --> 00:59:31.239
- I have a plan.

666
00:59:31.639 --> 00:59:32.400
- Okay?

667
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.280
- I need you to make a distraction.

668
00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.039
Something big. you know to draw him in
so I can take him out.

669
00:59:40.239 --> 00:59:40.959
- Okay.

670
00:59:45.159 --> 00:59:47.119
- I'm gonna slap the living shit out of you.
- I'm sorry.

671
00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.839
- What the hell is wrong with you?

672
00:59:49.239 --> 00:59:50.759
- I think I should fake an injury.

673
00:59:55.439 --> 00:59:58.680
Ah. ah. agh my leg!
- What are you doing?

674
00:59:59.079 --> 01:00:00.079
- Charlie horse!

675
01:00:00.319 --> 01:00:02.800
Don't just stand there give me some water!

676
01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.400
- Everybody out. come on.

677
01:00:13.439 --> 01:00:15.680
Let's go. hurry up. everybody out! Come on.

678
01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.479
- Let's go. let's go.

679
01:00:23.879 --> 01:00:26.800
- Hey. All is left is to get Brittney.

680
01:00:27.759 --> 01:00:34.519
- No. listen.I’ll take care of it.

681
01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.319
Brittney's on the next floor up.

682
01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.000
You have to go the other way to get there.

683
01:00:59.439 --> 01:01:00.239
- What about you?

684
01:01:01.039 --> 01:01:02.079
What about Kolburn?

685
01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.479
- Don't worry about me.

686
01:01:04.079 --> 01:01:04.959
I'll handle him.

687
01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.319
Kolburn likes the play games
but he's in luck. 'cause I do too.

688
01:01:12.119 --> 01:01:13.800
Go. I'm all right. go.

689
01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.200
Damn.

690
01:01:20.439 --> 01:01:23.519
I suspected a lot of cops to be in on this. but you?

691
01:01:24.039 --> 01:01:25.720
What happened to wanting to make a difference?

692
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.159
- Ain't no choice.

693
01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.800
I got bills.

694
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.079
And an ex-wife I gotta take care of.

695
01:01:36.039 --> 01:01:37.800
Oh shit. you wouldn't understand.

696
01:01:38.959 --> 01:01:40.879
God damn city doesn't pay me enough.

697
01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.519
Busted my ass all those years

698
01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.360
and I got nothing to show for it.

699
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.879
- You know. I'm quite disappointed Kolburn.

700
01:01:51.519 --> 01:01:52.839
- Ha. I gotta make end's meet.

701
01:01:54.519 --> 01:01:56.959
- So deciding to join Mr. Big
was the right thing to do?

702
01:01:57.519 --> 01:01:59.680
- I can't complain about all the extra money I'm making.

703
01:02:01.839 --> 01:02:02.800
- You're better than this.

704
01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:04.439
You don't have to do this.

705
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.800
- Yeah. I kinda do.

706
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.439
- Kolburn listen. help us take down Mr. Big.

707
01:02:11.839 --> 01:02:13.959
Okay. you're not ready
for what's to come if you don't stop.

708
01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:15.159
- Ready?

709
01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.239
When this is over with. you're gonna be gone
and forgotten about.

710
01:02:20.839 --> 01:02:21.759
- Real funny.

711
01:02:23.159 --> 01:02:24.680
- Did you ever think you were a good cop?

712
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.319
You're a fucking joke.

713
01:02:28.239 --> 01:02:29.680
- Is that what your wife said when she left you?

714
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.400
- Fuck you.

715
01:02:31.879 --> 01:02:32.800
- You wish.

716
01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.879
- Well. one of us is gonna die here tonight.

717
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.360
And it's gonna be.

718
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.039
- You're right.

719
01:02:55.519 --> 01:02:57.000
Only one us was gonna die tonight.

720
01:02:59.079 --> 01:03:00.000
But it was you.

721
01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:07.879
- Do you know what?

722
01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.800
I'm done.

723
01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:11.280
that's it.

724
01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:14.319
I'm pulling the plug.
- Auntie.

725
01:03:15.319 --> 01:03:17.239
Please. listen to me.

726
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.239
My mom saw what La'Marr was scheming.

727
01:03:23.039 --> 01:03:25.439
She saw that he was only using you all along.

728
01:03:26.959 --> 01:03:32.560
She set him up to get arrested to save you.

729
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.200
When La'Marr figured out
what she was scheming.

730
01:03:38.439 --> 01:03:40.079
he manipulated the situation

731
01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.560
and turned you against your own sister.

732
01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.519
- What?

733
01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.239
Why would he do that?

734
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.959
- Control.

735
01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:51.200
La'Marr loves to be in control.

736
01:03:52.079 --> 01:03:54.000
Look what he's making you do.

737
01:03:55.159 --> 01:03:57.400
Neither Kate nor I would ever betray you.

738
01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.319
I love you.

739
01:04:00.439 --> 01:04:01.800
More than life itself.

740
01:04:04.959 --> 01:04:07.119
Remember that book that
I was writing a few years ago?

741
01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:09.360
I finished it

742
01:04:10.639 --> 01:04:12.280
and I dedicated it to you.

743
01:04:14.159 --> 01:04:17.920
I even used that quote that you always told me
when I was growing up.

744
01:04:18.639 --> 01:04:23.479
On this planet there's nothing more
- Prized and powerful than true friendship.

745
01:04:25.519 --> 01:04:26.360
- Auntie.

746
01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.360
we had true friendship.

747
01:04:30.959 --> 01:04:34.360
We forged that bond that
was never to be broken.

748
01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:37.720
Look at us now!

749
01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.400
Please.

750
01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.319
Please.

751
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:05.680
No!

752
01:05:05.879 --> 01:05:07.600
No. no. auntie please. no!

753
01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.280
No. no. don't leave me.

754
01:05:11.839 --> 01:05:14.479
Don't leave me. please. no.

755
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.519
No.

756
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:18.800
No.

757
01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.720
- Brittney!

758
01:05:24.039 --> 01:05:25.519
- Jordan. Jordan. watch out!

759
01:05:25.759 --> 01:05:26.319
- Oh!

760
01:05:28.039 --> 01:05:30.079
- Jordan. Jordan. Jordan.

761
01:05:46.239 --> 01:05:47.600
- Dre. Dre!

762
01:05:47.759 --> 01:05:48.439
- Alex!

763
01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:52.280
- Dre.

764
01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.920
I was so worried about you.

765
01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:56.920
I tried to text and call.

766
01:05:57.079 --> 01:05:58.639
Are you okay?
- Yeah. yeah.

767
01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.800
We're okay.

768
01:06:00.959 --> 01:06:02.720
- Dre. where's Brittney?

769
01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.839
Oh my god.

770
01:07:03.439 --> 01:07:05.239
- Jordan. Jordan.

771
01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.479
Jordan.

772
01:07:07.839 --> 01:07:10.519
Mr. Big. he's heading for the helicopter.

773
01:07:11.039 --> 01:07:14.000
Go. go. go.

774
01:07:46.839 --> 01:07:47.959
- That's a pretty good shot.

775
01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:49.800
Not as good as mine.

776
01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.879
I see I taught you well.

777
01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:58.039
You could have been a very powerful weapon.

778
01:07:59.959 --> 01:08:01.039
But just like Geno.

779
01:08:01.839 --> 01:08:03.239
you ain't got no heart.

780
01:08:04.119 --> 01:08:05.119
That's why I left.

781
01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.119
can't you see?

782
01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.560
I had no use for you.

783
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.839
You're useless. Jordan.

784
01:08:14.639 --> 01:08:16.959
Go ahead. pull the trigger.

785
01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:19.759
Pull the trigger. mother fucker!

786
01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:22.720
You don't got the balls.

787
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.959
.You don't got the balls!

788
01:08:49.879 --> 01:08:50.479
- We got him.

789
01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:52.720
- We gotta go. there's a bomb in the building.
We gotta go.

790
01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:54.920
Come on. let's go. we gotta go.

791
01:08:56.039 --> 01:08:59.039
- Everybody move.

792
01:08:59.039 --> 01:09:02.479
move. get away! As far as you can.
The building's going to explode.

793
01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:04.280
- Dre!

794
01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:08.239
What are you doing?
- We have to go. now!

795
01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:10.159
- I'm not leaving without Brittney.

796
01:09:11.039 --> 01:09:13.639
- Are you crazy?
- No. no. I can't.

797
01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.360
- But Dre.

798
01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:16.280
- We can't just stay here.
- I'm not leaving.

799
01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.280
- No. we can't stay here.
- No. I'm not. I can't leave. I can't.

800
01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.600
- Dre.
- Dre. Dre. we don't have a choice.

801
01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.479
Come on. come on.

802
01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.239
- Move your ass.

803
01:10:04.159 --> 01:10:06.000
- So nice to see you. bud.

804
01:10:06.639 --> 01:10:08.159
How are you doing. buddy?

805
01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.439
I’ll help you up.

806
01:10:16.319 --> 01:10:18.280
- Brittney.

807
01:10:29.879 --> 01:10:31.879
- All right. let's go.

808
01:10:32.519 --> 01:10:33.479
There's nothing left.

809
01:10:42.479 --> 01:10:43.280
Brittney.

810
01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.600
- I would like to congratulate these individuals.

811
01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.560
My dear friend. Brittney. John. Dre.

812
01:11:02.879 --> 01:11:05.319
and now Detective Harold.

813
01:11:05.959 --> 01:11:10.519
for working so hard to save so many lives.
including my own.

814
01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.039
And bringing down

815
01:11:12.479 --> 01:11:13.839
La'Marr Watkins.

816
01:11:14.079 --> 01:11:16.400
Better known to some as Mr. Big.

817
01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:20.319
One of the most dangerous criminals in this world.

818
01:11:21.639 --> 01:11:24.280
I just think that it's time for us to move forward

819
01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.159
to make Seattle an even safer place to live

820
01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.479
and raise our families.

821
01:11:29.879 --> 01:11:31.400
Thank you so much.

822
01:11:31.439 --> 01:11:32.720
- Thank you for everything.

823
01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.720
- No. thank you.

824
01:11:46.839 --> 01:11:48.439
- Quite unfortunate what happened.

825
01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:52.400
I lost my best men that night.

826
01:11:57.519 --> 01:11:59.600
I'm quite disappointed.

827
01:12:02.239 --> 01:12:03.280
Not in you.

828
01:12:07.079 --> 01:12:10.280
Listen. we still have unfinished business

829
01:12:10.319 --> 01:12:11.839
that needs to be taken care of.

830
01:12:12.319 --> 01:12:15.159
I need you to take care of this.

831
01:12:20.079 --> 01:12:21.800
You don't want to disappoint me. do you?

832
01:12:22.079 --> 01:12:23.959
- No. no of course not.

833
01:12:26.639 --> 01:12:27.639
- Because if you do.

834
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.839
There'll be consequences.

835
01:12:42.079 --> 01:12:44.800
It's time we paid the city a little visit.
