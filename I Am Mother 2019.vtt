00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:32.213
<i>Your sepsis will only worsen</i>
<i>if you don't allow me to treat you.</i>

539
00:45:34.005 --> 00:45:36.630
<i>Your blood is infected</i>
<i>with bacteria from your wound.</i>

540
00:45:36.755 --> 00:45:37.796
That's bullshit.

541
00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.463
<i>Soon you will go into shock.</i>

542
00:45:39.546 --> 00:45:40.963
[woman groaning] See...

543
00:45:41.088 --> 00:45:42.838
see what its medicine's done to me?

544
00:45:43.338 --> 00:45:45.838
<i>-I gave you the means to prevent this...</i>
-Ah!

545
00:45:45.921 --> 00:45:48.838
<i>but it seems you've left a bullet and</i>
<i>soiled clothing fibers lodged in your hip.</i>

546
00:45:48.921 --> 00:45:50.213
[Daughter] Can you remove them?

547
00:45:50.713 --> 00:45:52.088
[Mother]<i> That's up to our guest.</i>

548
00:45:52.505 --> 00:45:54.755
<i>Such a procedure would require anesthesia.</i>

549
00:45:55.213 --> 00:45:56.546
Like hell. [groans]

550
00:45:57.046 --> 00:45:59.963
<i>Perhaps. once your organs begin failing.</i>
<i>you'll reconsider.</i>

551
00:46:01.046 --> 00:46:02.338
[woman] I'll take my chances.

552
00:46:02.421 --> 00:46:03.296
I'll do it.

553
00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:05.296
What?

554
00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:07.463
<i>-Daughter--</i>
-I'll remove the bullet.

555
00:46:10.546 --> 00:46:12.213
That dozer's not coming near me.

556
00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.421
[woman moaning]

557
00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:23.671
[groans]

558
00:46:26.713 --> 00:46:28.588
[Mother] <i>Tell me what you see. Daughter.</i>

559
00:46:28.796 --> 00:46:30.838
[woman panting]

560
00:46:34.171 --> 00:46:36.088
[Daughter] The bullet
and its missile fragments

561
00:46:36.171 --> 00:46:38.713
are lodged between
the acetabulum and the femoral head.

562
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:39.630
Ah!

563
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:41.338
Oh. God!

564
00:46:42.671 --> 00:46:44.505
[groans]

565
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:45.921
[breathes sharply]

566
00:46:50.338 --> 00:46:51.546
[Daughter]
A major portion of the bullet

567
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.630
lies 23 millimeters posterior

568
00:46:53.713 --> 00:46:55.671
to the femoral nerve
and the femoral artery.

569
00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:59.213
It doesn't look like I'll be able
to obtain adequate grip with forceps.

570
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:04.380
-Once she's asleep. I'd--
-[woman] I'm not going under.

571
00:47:11.463 --> 00:47:15.338
[Mother] <i>Technically. it's possible.</i>
<i>but an unnecessary risk.</i>

572
00:47:18.588 --> 00:47:20.296
<i>Do you have an approach. Daughter?</i>

573
00:47:25.463 --> 00:47:26.505
A guide-wire?

574
00:47:26.963 --> 00:47:28.088
Along the bullet path?

575
00:47:30.255 --> 00:47:31.255
[Mother] <i>Very good.</i>

576
00:47:36.796 --> 00:47:38.130
[Daughter]
I need to clean the wound.

577
00:47:38.213 --> 00:47:40.255
This... may be uncomfortable.

578
00:47:47.713 --> 00:47:49.713
[sucking]

579
00:47:50.338 --> 00:47:51.171
I'm sorry.

580
00:47:52.838 --> 00:47:55.713
[groans]

581
00:47:56.046 --> 00:47:57.255

[drill whirring]

583
00:48:04.838 --> 00:48:06.046
What the hell is that for?

584
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:09.671
I have to drill this into the bullet
in order to pull it out.

585
00:48:11.796 --> 00:48:12.630
It'll hurt.

586
00:48:13.046 --> 00:48:15.505
But there's less risk
to neighboring structures.

587
00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.005

00:48:33.088 --> 00:48:34.005

Oh. God.

[Mother] <i>Are you all right?</i>

597
00:49:04.171 --> 00:49:05.463
<i>You did well in there.</i>

598
00:49:06.671 --> 00:49:07.713
<i>You should be proud.</i>

599
00:49:09.171 --> 00:49:11.380
<i>You rest. I'll go clean up the blood.</i>

600
00:49:11.463 --> 00:49:12.296

606
00:49:31.921 --> 00:49:34.255
[Whoopi Goldberg] <i>I have to give</i>
<i>Mr. Blackwel</i>l <i>something to talk about.</i>

607
00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:35.546
[Johnny Carson] <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Do you believe his stuff?</i>

608
00:49:35.963 --> 00:49:37.588
<i>He comes out. Mr. Blackwell.</i>
<i>the dress designer.</i>

609
00:49:37.671 --> 00:49:40.213
<i>who comes out every year with</i>
<i>the ten worst-dressed women or something.</i>

610
00:49:40.296 --> 00:49:41.838
[Whoopi Goldberg] <i>I have never seen</i>
<i>anything he's designed...</i>

611
00:49:41.921 --> 00:49:42.796
It's just saline.

612
00:49:46.005 --> 00:49:47.088
You passed out.

613
00:49:51.046 --> 00:49:52.630
Your vitals are nearly stable.

614
00:49:54.171 --> 00:49:55.213
[Johnny Carson]
<i>...good to have you on the show.</i>

615
00:49:55.296 --> 00:49:56.213
It's a good thing.

616
00:49:56.463 --> 00:49:59.046
[Johnny Carson] <i>I walked in</i>

617

What's that?

620
00:50:08.796 --> 00:50:09.713
Here. I'll show you.

621
00:50:15.671 --> 00:50:16.921
[Johnny Carson]
<i>Do you like that kind of stuff?</i>

622
00:50:17.005 --> 00:50:18.588
<i>I can't eat before a show.</i>
<i>I don't know why.</i>

623
00:50:18.671 --> 00:50:21.005
[Whoopi Goldberg] <i>Well. you know.</i>
<i>I'm in the middle of making this movie...</i>

624
00:50:21.213 --> 00:50:22.255
It's kind of dumb.

625
00:50:23.046 --> 00:50:23.963
Let me see.

626
00:50:24.921 --> 00:50:27.171
<i>...done. So I get tired. </i>

627
00:50:27.255 --> 00:50:28.671
[Johnny Carson]
<i>Let's talk about that. What do you mean?</i>

628
00:50:28.838 --> 00:50:29.880
That's Johnny.

629
00:50:30.421 --> 00:50:31.546
And tonight's guest.

630
00:50:33.505 --> 00:50:34.880
Have you seen the show before?

631
00:50:37.171 --> 00:50:38.171
A long time ago.

632
00:50:44.546 --> 00:50:45.671
I almost forgot.

633
00:50:52.963 --> 00:50:54.046
I can get you more.

634
00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:08.796
[breathes deeply]

635
00:51:17.505 --> 00:51:19.088
You did right by me last night.

636
00:51:23.296 --> 00:51:24.130
I just...

637
00:51:24.505 --> 00:51:26.130
did what anyone would.

638
00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.630
You don't know people.

639
00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:32.755
I'd like to.

640
00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:43.505
Can I show you something else?

641
00:52:33.588 --> 00:52:34.713
I brought it for you.

642
00:52:41.588 --> 00:52:43.296
You can trust us. you know.

643
00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:49.921
If there are...

644
00:52:51.338 --> 00:52:53.046
people out there...

645
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.505
we have enough food and supplies.

646
00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.005
We could help them.

647
00:53:00.796 --> 00:53:01.921
We helped you.

648
00:53:02.505 --> 00:53:03.588
<i>You </i>helped me.

649
00:53:05.171 --> 00:53:06.005
You.

650
00:53:10.838 --> 00:53:14.171
Listen. if I tell you something.
can you keep it between us?

651
00:53:19.713 --> 00:53:20.921
I was on a night run...

652
00:53:21.421 --> 00:53:22.963
bringing food back to the camp.

653
00:53:23.713 --> 00:53:25.546
-Me and a couple of others.
-What camp?

654
00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:28.171
The mines.

655
00:53:28.921 --> 00:53:30.671
I lived most my life there.

656
00:53:31.296 --> 00:53:32.380
With... with them?

657
00:53:33.421 --> 00:53:35.171
Jacob and I got turned around.

658
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.296
We figured we'd wait it out.

659
00:53:39.213 --> 00:53:42.588
It had hardly been an hour when the dozers
found us hiding in the field.

660
00:53:50.505 --> 00:53:51.546
Jacob. was he your--

661
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:53.213
My brother basically.

662
00:53:54.671 --> 00:53:56.046
He led them away from me.

663
00:53:57.213 --> 00:53:58.963
That's how I made it to your door.

664
00:54:01.005 --> 00:54:02.046
Look.

665
00:54:06.755 --> 00:54:08.130
That's Jacob.

666
00:54:08.963 --> 00:54:10.296
And his wife. Rachel.

667
00:54:15.046 --> 00:54:16.796
His parents found me as a baby.

668
00:54:17.838 --> 00:54:18.671
Orphaned.

669
00:54:20.171 --> 00:54:21.463
Raised me as their own.

670
00:54:30.921 --> 00:54:31.838
Who's this?

671
00:54:33.963 --> 00:54:34.796
Simon.

672
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.838
He's about your age. in fact.

673
00:54:39.713 --> 00:54:40.588
Simon

674
00:54:44.921 --> 00:54:46.338
There are so many.

675
00:54:52.171 --> 00:54:53.296
Less now.

676
00:54:56.921 --> 00:54:58.380
Maybe you could talk to them.

677
00:54:59.296 --> 00:55:00.880
You know. about coming here.

678
00:55:00.963 --> 00:55:02.463
It's safer in the mines.

679
00:55:08.963 --> 00:55:10.338
We could go there together.

680
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.713
You and me.

681
00:55:15.838 --> 00:55:16.963
You don't belong here.

682
00:55:20.338 --> 00:55:21.713
-I don't think it's...
-[door beeps and slides open]

683
00:55:21.796 --> 00:55:23.588
[Mother] <i>You don't think what?</i>

684
00:55:23.671 --> 00:55:26.005
She's doing better. Mother.

685
00:55:30.421 --> 00:55:31.671
<i>What don't you think?</i>

686
00:55:32.046 --> 00:55:35.130
I was just saying it's probably too early
to put weight on her leg.

687
00:55:37.963 --> 00:55:40.546
<i>She's right.</i>
<i>You'll need to wait several days.</i>

688
00:55:42.296 --> 00:55:43.796
<i>She needs to rest. Daughter.</i>

689
00:55:44.838 --> 00:55:46.755
I'll just. um. stay and read in case--

690
00:55:46.838 --> 00:55:48.338
<i>You have other matters to attend to.</i>

691
00:55:50.296 --> 00:55:52.171
<i>Your exam remains incomplete.</i>

692
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:54.171
My exam?

693
00:55:55.755 --> 00:55:56.630
Now?

694
00:55:57.130 --> 00:55:58.255
<i>Yes. Daughter.</i>

695
00:55:58.671 --> 00:55:59.505
<i>Now.</i>

696
00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:10.838
It's just a stupid test.

697
00:56:11.005 --> 00:56:12.588
<i>I'm sorry you feel that way.</i>

698
00:56:13.588 --> 00:56:14.505
Why did you take that?

699
00:56:15.005 --> 00:56:16.755
<i>I've discovered something troubling.</i>

700
00:56:17.213 --> 00:56:18.046
What?

701
00:56:19.338 --> 00:56:22.255
<i>It seems our guest has not been</i>
<i>entirely truthful with us.</i>

702
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:23.588
<i>About her wound.</i>

703
00:56:25.505 --> 00:56:26.421
How do you know?

704
00:56:27.046 --> 00:56:30.838
<i>The bullet you extracted matches</i>
<i>the caliber she fired into my chest.</i>

705
00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:32.921
So?

706
00:56:33.838 --> 00:56:35.171
<i>Droids don't use them.</i>

707
00:56:41.463 --> 00:56:42.338
Someone shot her.

708
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:44.755
[Mother] <i>With the same gun.</i>

709
00:56:45.921 --> 00:56:46.963
<i>Another human.</i>

710
00:56:48.296 --> 00:56:49.963
<i>Has she mentioned anyone else?</i>

711
00:56:53.588 --> 00:56:54.671
No. she. uh...

712
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:57.088
she hasn't said much at all.

713
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:02.671
<i>Nothing?</i>

714
00:57:07.713 --> 00:57:09.213

You done?

906
01:19:26.213 --> 01:19:27.296
You done?

907
01:19:30.755 --> 01:19:32.213
We haven't got time for this.

908
01:19:34.296 --> 01:19:35.505
You're alive. aren't you?

909
01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.380
Come on. we've got to find cover.

910
01:20:03.505 --> 01:20:04.755
You cut me. you know.

911
01:20:07.255 --> 01:20:08.338
I didn't mean to.

912
01:20:17.046 --> 01:20:17.880
Come on.

913
01:20:18.588 --> 01:20:19.671
We've got to keep moving.

914
01:20:21.671 --> 01:20:22.713
Is that where you...

915
01:20:24.088 --> 01:20:24.921
got shot?

[woman whispering] Come on.

924
01:21:31.005 --> 01:21:32.713
[Daughter] Do you think
it was looking for us?

925
01:21:34.296 --> 01:21:36.463
If it was. it would have found us.

927
01:21:48.463 --> 01:21:49.296

What are you doing? Get down.

929

They'll see you!

930
01:21:53.671 --> 01:21:55.380
When I say. "Get down." get down.

931
01:22:00.130 --> 01:22:01.546
You've got to stay closer.

932

Come on.

933
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:09.421
What are those things doing?

934
01:22:12.296 --> 01:22:14.255
[woman]
They showed up about six months ago.

935
01:22:15.171 --> 01:22:16.380
Along with the corn.

936
01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.588
All I know is. before that...

937
01:22:20.171 --> 01:22:22.046
you could hardly breathe the air.

938
01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.630
Wasn't a plant for miles.

939
01:22:25.796 --> 01:22:28.005
[Daughter] How many do you think
will go back with us?

940
01:22:28.088 --> 01:22:29.088
From the mines.

941
01:22:31.505 --> 01:22:32.671
[woman] We'll know soon enough.

942
01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.630

[ominous music playing]

944
01:22:55.546 --> 01:22:57.130
Are the mines much further?

952
01:24:29.088 --> 01:24:29.963
What is this?

953
01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:46.505
Where's everybody else?

954
01:24:50.796 --> 01:24:52.588
I fled the tunnels years ago.

955
01:24:56.546 --> 01:24:58.130
I haven't seen a person since.

956
01:24:58.713 --> 01:25:00.171
Not with flesh on their bones.

957
01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.213
They could still be there.

958
01:25:12.296 --> 01:25:13.296
If they were...

959
01:25:15.046 --> 01:25:16.755
it's the last place you'd want to be.

960
01:25:19.671 --> 01:25:21.630
-We need them. You said--
-They're gone.

961
01:25:23.296 --> 01:25:24.421
You don't know that.

962
01:25:24.796 --> 01:25:26.421
They were going mad with hunger.

963
01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:29.130
Doing terrible things to each other.

964
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.588
Believe me. it's just us.

965
01:25:33.213 --> 01:25:35.005
[inhales sharply]

966
01:25:41.213 --> 01:25:42.796
I never should have left him.

967
01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:45.130
You did everything you could.

968
01:25:47.046 --> 01:25:49.213
What I did was listen to you.

969
01:25:50.755 --> 01:25:52.005
And that's a good thing.

970
01:25:53.046 --> 01:25:54.005
For who?

971
01:25:55.255 --> 01:25:56.088
Look...

972
01:25:58.088 --> 01:26:00.046
it's no sin. looking out for yourself.

973
01:26:01.671 --> 01:26:02.505
Okay?

974
01:26:05.963 --> 01:26:07.255
We have to go back.

975
01:26:10.171 --> 01:26:11.171
We can't.

976
01:26:17.963 --> 01:26:18.838

977
01:26:27.463 --> 01:26:28.546

[panting]

985
01:26:45.630 --> 01:26:46.880
You can trust me.

986
01:26:48.796 --> 01:26:50.505
I know I've done things to make that hard.

987
01:26:50.588 --> 01:26:52.005
but I promise you you're safe here.

988
01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:55.046
And we're in this together now.

989
01:26:59.088 --> 01:27:00.296
Then come with me.

990
01:27:01.755 --> 01:27:03.296
I know how to handle Mother.

991
01:27:04.088 --> 01:27:05.213
Even if you could.

992
01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:08.171
what about the other dozers?

993
01:27:09.630 --> 01:27:10.463
You don't--

994
01:27:11.505 --> 01:27:12.671
You don't understand.

995
01:27:14.505 --> 01:27:15.963
You can't stay there.

996
01:27:19.046 --> 01:27:21.046
But we can get my brother.

997
01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:24.546
We've been through enough.

998
01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:29.005
Let's just--

999
01:27:31.171 --> 01:27:33.255
We'll think clearer with some food in us.

1000
01:27:34.171 --> 01:27:35.005
Okay?

You've seen how much of a threat
she and her kind can be.

1035

You mean my kind.

You murdered your own children.

1064
01:37:05.671 --> 01:37:07.338
