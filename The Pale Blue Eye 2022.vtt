[bugle fanfare playing]

7
00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.625
Morning. gentlemen.

00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:01.250
[horses whinnying]

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.333
- You Augustus Landor?
- I am.

10
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.250
And you?

11
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:09.375
Captain Hitchcock at your service.
Second-in-command at the Academy.

12
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.833
I'm here to inform you

13
00:02:11.916 --> 00:02:14.791
Superintendent Thayer
requests an immediate audience.

14
00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:17.916
- And the nature of this audience?
- I'll leave that to the colonel.

15
00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:21.791
- When might this take place?
- At your earliest convenience.

16
00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.875
[chuckles]

17
00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:28.416
And if I should decide not to come?

18
00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:34.291
That would be your own concern.
You're a private citizen.

19
00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:39.958
[exhales deeply]

20
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.208
Well. it's a fine day for a ride.

21
00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:48.500
[intriguing music playing]

22
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.625
[Thayer] <i>The governor suggests</i>

23
00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.458
<i>among New York City constables.</i>

24
00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:03.291
<i>And when he recommended your services.</i>
<i>he noted your impressive accomplishments.</i>

25
00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:06.666

<i>and solving a particularly grisly murder</i>

32

33

<i>Three years now.</i>

34
00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:39.125
- [Hitchcock] Shall I send for coffee?
- [Landor] Beer will do nicely.

[exhales]

37
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:48.166
You. uh…

38
00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:54.666
You keep these notes in a pigeonhole
back there somewhere. do you?

39
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.666
What else do they say?

40
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.958
Do they say that I haven't
darkened the door of a church

41
00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:01.625
in a long time?

42
00:04:03.083 --> 00:04:07.000
Does it mention
that my daughter ran off a while back?

43
00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:11.916
We are aware
of your daughter's disappearance.

44
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:14.416
And we offer our sympathy.

45
00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:18.500
With all due respect.
I hope I have not offended.

46
00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:21.166
No. No. no. no.

47
00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.583
No. sorry. I ought to apologize.

48
00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:27.375
And I do. Please carry on.

49
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.083
Mr. Landor. we are obliged
to proceed with extreme discretion.

50
00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:34.708
We're looking for someone.

51
00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:38.375
A private citizen
of well-documented industry and tact

52
00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:41.958
who might carry out inquiries
on the Academy's behalf.

53
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:44.125
Huh.

54
00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:46.625
They're of a highly complex
and delicate nature

55
00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:49.333
and concern one of our cadets.

56
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.458
Second-year man
from Kentucky by the name of Fry.

57
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.916
- Leroy Fry.
- There's no point in dancing around it.

58
00:04:58.041 --> 00:05:01.041
Fry hanged himself… last night.

59
00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:04.000
Oh.

60
00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:06.541
Well. I'm sorry to hear that.

61
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:12.458
A dreadful business. this.
But you must understand our position.

62
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:16.541
We have been specifically charged
with the care of these young men.

63
00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:20.708
to make them gentlemen and soldiers.
and to that end. we drive them.

64
00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:26.000
But we'd like to think
we know when to… stop driving them.

65
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:28.750
A boy hangs himself…

66
00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:31.666
uh. that's a matter for the coroner.

67
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.750
[Hitchcock] I'm afraid
that's not the end of it.

68
00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:41.500
Cadet Fry's body was
violated last night in the hospital ward.

69
00:05:42.916 --> 00:05:45.541
Violated? By whom?

70
00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:48.958
Well. if we knew that. we would
have had no need to summon you.

71
00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:51.833
I'm sure the Academy
has its share of pranksters.

72
00:05:51.916 --> 00:05:54.500
This was no prank. Mr. Landor.

73
00:05:56.375 --> 00:06:00.125
Leroy Fry's heart
was carved from his chest.

74
00:06:01.541 --> 00:06:03.541
[somber music playing]

75
00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:07.291
[Landor] Dr. Marquis. how does
a person go about doing this?

76
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:13.708
[Dr. Marquis] Scalpel. Or any good.
sharp knife would do.

77
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:18.458
But getting to the heart.
that's the tricky part.

78
00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:24.416
Those gashes on the lungs and liver

79
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.625
came from angling
the blade to save the heart.

80
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:31.541
And how would one preserve the heart?

81
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.375
A container of some sort.

82
00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:38.541
Wrapped in muslin. maybe. or newspaper.

83
00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:41.666
Very likely surrounded by ice.

84
00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:44.916
What type of fella could do this?

85
00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:47.708
A strong one.

86
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:49.500
Not a woman. then?

87
00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:53.083
No woman as I've ever had
the pleasure of meeting. no.

88
00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:55.708
[Landor] What about his medical pedigree?

89
00:06:55.791 --> 00:07:00.708
Would he need to be as well-educated
and well-trained as yourself?

90
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.416
Not necessarily.

91
00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:07.083
He'd need a lot of light.
and know where to cut.

92
00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:11.500
but it wouldn't have to be
a doctor or a surgeon.

93
00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:13.166
- It'd have to be--
- A madman!

94
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:15.833
And still out there.

95
00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:20.000
[drill sergeant] Port arms!

96
00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:22.541
[Thayer] You'll have to forgive me.
Mr. Landor.

97
00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:24.791
You've found us
in a very delicate position.

98
00:07:24.875 --> 00:07:26.083
[drill sergeant] Left. face!

99
00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:28.500
There are certain
powerful senators in Washington

100
00:07:28.583 --> 00:07:32.375
who would like nothing more than
to see us fail utterly. to shut us down.

101
00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:40.541
I'm asking you to help save the honor
of the United States Military Academy.

102
00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:43.041
And save it. I'll try.

103
00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:46.541
[pensive music playing]

104
00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:51.333
[Landor] You were. uh. on guard duty
last night. Mr. Huntoon.

105
00:07:51.416 --> 00:07:52.458
Yes. sir.

106
00:07:53.083 --> 00:07:56.375
Post at 9:30. Relieved at midnight
and made my way back to the guardroom.

107
00:07:56.458 --> 00:07:57.625
Where is that?

108
00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:00.333
Number four. sir. By Fort Clinton.

109
00:08:00.416 --> 00:08:03.125
I… I admit. I'm not very familiar
with the grounds.

110
00:08:03.208 --> 00:08:05.916
but it seems that the part
we're standing on right now

111
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.583
is not on the way
from Fort Clinton to North Barracks.

112
00:08:10.666 --> 00:08:12.708
- No. sir.
- Oh. What took you off course?

113
00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:15.500
Well. sir. on my way. I heard something.

114
00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:17.875
I reckoned it was an animal.

115
00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.375
It sounded like it was dying
or caught in a trap. so I came to help.

116
00:08:21.458 --> 00:08:23.541
I'm terribly partial to animals.

117
00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:29.416
Uh… I was running this way
until I brushed Cadet Fry. sir.

118
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.833
- How'd he look?
- Not well. sir.

119
00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:34.250
He wasn't hanging straight.

120
00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:37.916
It was almost
as if he was seated in a chair.

121
00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:40.666
I'm not following you.

122
00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:43.458
Well. his feet were
touching the ground. sir.

123
00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:47.875
- His feet were touching the ground?
- Yes. sir.

124
00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:53.625
All right. What did you do next?

125
00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:57.541
I ran. Ran straight back
to North Barracks.

126
00:08:58.583 --> 00:08:59.416
Hmm.

127
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.875
Uh. one last question
and I'll trouble you no more.

128
00:09:04.541 --> 00:09:06.333
Did you see anyone else about?

129
00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:08.041
No. sir.

130
00:09:11.125 --> 00:09:12.125
Mr. Huntoon.

131
00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:17.833
[pensive music continues]

132
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
[Landor] <i>The neck…</i>

133
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.583
That's what first struck me.

134
00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:25.208
See?

135
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:29.000
Not a clean cinch at all.
The rope grabbed at him

136
00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:33.083
and ran up and down the neck
looking for purchase.

137
00:09:33.166 --> 00:09:34.583
As though…

138
00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:37.416
As though he was… fighting.

139
00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:38.958
Hmm?

140
00:09:40.791 --> 00:09:42.583
Look. if you would. at his fingers.

141
00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:45.458
Blistered fresh
from clutching at the rope…

142
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:46.833
[door opens]

143
00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:50.125
- …trying to peel the thing off him.
- [door closes]

144
00:09:50.208 --> 00:09:52.416
May I ask what's going on here?

145
00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:55.875
This is. uh. quite irregular.

146
00:09:57.125 --> 00:10:01.500
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
feeling around the back of Mr. Fry's head.

147
00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:03.833
You did examine Mr. Fry?

148
00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:06.916
Of course I examined him. as is my job.

149
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.833
[Landor] Hmm.

150
00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:14.125
[Dr. Marquis softly] Haven't we already
been through this?

151
00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:27.375
- Uh…
- Hmm.

152
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.250
There is a contusion of sort.

153
00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:34.625
Parietal region.

154
00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:37.875
Approximately three inches.

155
00:10:41.291 --> 00:10:42.375
[breathes deeply]

156
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:44.791
- I must have missed that.
- Mmm.

157
00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:48.791
[Hitchcock] Someone murdered Mr. Fry.

158
00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:52.000
Is this what
you're telling us. Mr. Landor?

159
00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:55.166
You might be onto something there.
Captain Hitchcock.

160
00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:08.416
[bones crack]

161
00:11:11.708 --> 00:11:13.125
[cracking]

162
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.166
Well. anyone
could have missed that. doctor.

163
00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:36.666
Mr. Landor.

164
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.416
[soldiers marching nearby]

165
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
[door closes]

166
00:11:40.083 --> 00:11:41.500
So now you're on board.

167
00:11:42.416 --> 00:11:45.083
I think it's important
we set some ground rules.

168
00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:49.750
You will report to me
on a daily basis and I to the colonel.

169
00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:54.666
And you mustn't breathe a word of this
to anyone. inside or outside the Academy.

170
00:11:56.166 --> 00:11:58.666
- Is that all?
- One final condition.

171
00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:03.875
There will be no drinking throughout
the course of this investigation.

172
00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:08.250
Your reputation precedes you.

173
00:12:16.041 --> 00:12:18.041
[distant animal calls]

174
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.833
- [Landor sighs]
- [footsteps approaching]

175
00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:33.875
[Landor grunts]

176
00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:34.958
Oh.

177
00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:35.875
Pardon.

178
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.416
- Are you Augustus Landor?
- [coughs] I am.

179
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.500
Unless I mistake. you've been
tasked with solving the mystery

180
00:12:42.583 --> 00:12:44.125
surrounding Leroy Fry.

181
00:12:44.208 --> 00:12:46.416
That's so. What might I do for you?

182
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.250
It is incumbent upon me
and the honor of this institution

183
00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:53.583
to divulge some of the conclusions
which I have reached.

184
00:12:53.666 --> 00:12:54.625
Conclusions?

185
00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:57.000
Regarding the late Mr. Fry.

186
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.625
I'd be most interested.

187
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:02.333
The man you're looking for

188
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.250
is a poet.

189
00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.375
[marching band playing]

190
00:13:15.291 --> 00:13:16.583
[Landor] Private Cochrane.

191
00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:20.666
When Leroy Fry's body
was brought back to the hospital.

192
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.333
you were detailed to guard it?

193
00:13:23.416 --> 00:13:24.625
I was. sir.

194
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.291
- Did anything happen while on watch?
- Not till around 2:30.

195
00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.708
- That's when I was relieved of my duty.
- Who relieved you?

196
00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:38.333
- Private. who relieved you?
- I can't tell you. sir.

197
00:13:39.416 --> 00:13:40.916
Only that it was an officer.

198
00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:44.541
- He never identified himself?
- No. sir.

199
00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:47.291
But I wouldn't expect it of an officer.

200
00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:49.583
Hmm.

201
00:13:49.666 --> 00:13:51.333
What did this officer say to you?

202
00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:56.541
He said. "Thank you. private.
That will be all. I'm relieving you."

203
00:13:56.625 --> 00:14:00.291
- An odd request. no?
- Yes. sir. Very.

204
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.666
- Did you see this officer's face?
- No. sir.

205
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.875
I had only a candle. It was terribly dark.

206
00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.750
Right. tell me then.
how did you know it was an officer?

207
00:14:10.833 --> 00:14:15.416
The bar on his shoulder. sir.
But I must admit. it was so very strange.

208
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.375
- How so?
- The bars.

209
00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:20.625
The bars on his left shoulder
were missing.

210
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.250
[intriguing music playing]

211
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.500
[violin playing softly]

212
00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:35.666
[door opens]

213
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:38.750
[door closes]

214
00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:40.916
[Benny] Ah. there's the man himself.

215
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.958
Benny knows a man
who's in need of a drink when he sees one.

216
00:14:45.041 --> 00:14:49.125
The very sight of it warms my blood.

217
00:14:49.916 --> 00:14:51.375
- Benny!
- Sir.

218
00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:54.708
- Here's… to rules.
- Fuck 'em.

219
00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:02.625
Patsy.

220
00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:04.458
Patsy!

221
00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:05.541
What's grieving you?

222
00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:09.958
Did you hear about that poor cadet?

223
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.583
- They say it took him hours to die.
- "They"?

224
00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:17.666
Him.

225
00:15:31.291 --> 00:15:34.083
Aren't you meant to be in recital?

226
00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:35.750
Uh… Good evening. Recital?

227
00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:37.291
No. I won't be missed.

228
00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:39.791
They hardly know I'm at the Academy.

229
00:15:39.875 --> 00:15:45.000
And besides. I've learned more
in rooms like this than any classroom.

230
00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:47.250
I don't doubt it.

231
00:15:47.333 --> 00:15:50.875
Sit. please. Please. sit. Have a… Have a…

232
00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.541
- Seat?
- Seat. Thank you. Uh…

233
00:15:54.583 --> 00:15:56.708
Fourth Classman Poe. E. A. Poe.

234
00:15:57.625 --> 00:15:59.208
Edgar A. Poe.

235
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.333
Worked up quite a thirst. I see.

236
00:16:02.416 --> 00:16:05.041
Helps take the bite off the gloom.

237
00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:11.791
Um…

238
00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:17.833
So tell me. how did you learn
about Leroy Fry?

239
00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:21.333
Uh. well. from Huntoon. of course.

240
00:16:21.416 --> 00:16:25.625
He has been spouting the news
like the town crier. [chuckles softly]

241
00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:27.916
Perhaps someone
might hang <i>him</i> before too long.

242
00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:32.916
You don't mean to imply
that someone <i>hanged</i> Mr. Fry?

243
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.916
I don't mean to imply anything.

244
00:16:37.291 --> 00:16:43.458
Why do you think that the man
who cut Leroy Fry's heart out

245
00:16:44.166 --> 00:16:45.166
was a poet?

246
00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:46.791
Well…

247
00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:51.750
The heart is a symbol or it is nothing.

248
00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:54.583
Now take away the symbol
and what do you have?

249
00:16:56.291 --> 00:17:00.791
It's a fistful of muscle of no more
aesthetic interest than a bladder.

250
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.083
Now. to remove a man's heart
is to traffic in symbol.

251
00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:07.250
And who better equipped for such labor

252
00:17:09.041 --> 00:17:09.875
than a poet?

253
00:17:10.583 --> 00:17:13.750
Awfully literal-minded poet.
it would seem--

254
00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:16.333
Oh. you cannot pretend
that this act of savagery

255
00:17:16.416 --> 00:17:21.958
did not startle the literary resonances
from the very crevices of your mind.

256
00:17:24.583 --> 00:17:27.041
Lord Suckling's charming song.

257
00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:31.125
<i>"I prithee send me back my heart</i>
<i>Since I cannot have thine"</i>

258
00:17:31.208 --> 00:17:33.333
Or… Or the Bible even.

259
00:17:33.416 --> 00:17:35.291
"Create in me a clean heart. O God."

260
00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:39.416
"A broken and a contrite heart
thou wilt not despise."

261
00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:44.500
Then we might just as easily
be seeking a religious maniac.

262
00:17:44.583 --> 00:17:49.208
No. you see. I neglected
to tell you that I am a poet myself.

263
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:50.916
hence inclined to think as one.

264
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.333
[exhales heavily]
I don't get around to poetry much.

265
00:17:55.083 --> 00:17:56.875
Why should you? You're an American.

266
00:17:58.541 --> 00:17:59.541
And you?

267
00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:03.708
An artist.
That is to say. without country.

268
00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:07.333
- Oh… [laughing]
- What. Mr. Landor?

269
00:18:08.458 --> 00:18:09.708
You've been a great help.

270
00:18:13.458 --> 00:18:16.916
You want a second look
at a cadet named Loughborough.

271
00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:22.833
In former days. Leroy Fry's roommate.
until they had a falling out.

272
00:18:23.833 --> 00:18:27.375
The nature of which remains uncertain.

273
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
[unsettling music playing]

274
00:18:47.416 --> 00:18:48.708
[Hitchcock] Mr. Loughborough.

275
00:18:48.791 --> 00:18:53.208
Tell Mr. Landor
how you were acquainted with Mr. Fry.

276
00:18:53.291 --> 00:18:56.000
Yes. sir. We were roommates.

277
00:18:56.083 --> 00:18:56.916
Hmm.

278
00:18:58.375 --> 00:19:00.750
You ever have a falling out?

279
00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:04.833
I wouldn't call it a falling out. Just…

280
00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:09.625
a matter of diverging paths. sir.

281
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.958
- What made you diverge?
- Well…

282
00:19:12.875 --> 00:19:14.208
Nothing so…

283
00:19:16.041 --> 00:19:17.416
A matter of course.

284
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.916
[sternly] If you know of anything
pertaining to Mr. Fry.

285
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.833
you're bound to disclose it at once.

286
00:19:22.875 --> 00:19:25.666
Well. it's like this. sir.

287
00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.958
I'd say he'd fallen in with

288
00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:32.833
a bad bunch.

289
00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:36.166
At least that's what he called them.

290
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:41.083
[Landor] Now then. tell me.
by "bad bunch."

291
00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:43.041
did he mean other cadets?

292
00:19:43.125 --> 00:19:46.333
[Loughborough] He never said.
but I assumed so.

293
00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:48.750
And why didn't you come forward earlier?

294
00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:52.041
I didn't quite see
that it had any bearing.

295
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.291
happening so long ago. sir.

296
00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.500
Dismissed.

297
00:20:02.541 --> 00:20:03.750
Mr. Stoddard.

298
00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:08.625
You were the last one
to see Mr. Fry alive.

299
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.166
Yes. sir.

300
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.583
- Speak up.
- I'm just a bit ill. sir.

301
00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:18.125
[clears throat] I did see Leroy
late on the night in question.

302
00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:21.500
Passed him on the way
to barracks as I was coming in.

303
00:20:23.083 --> 00:20:24.208
You spoke to him?

304
00:20:24.791 --> 00:20:27.625
He stopped me.
asking if any officers were about.

305
00:20:28.708 --> 00:20:29.791
How did Mr. Fry look?

306
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:34.875
It was so very dark.
I… I wouldn't trust my memory.

307
00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:39.083
Did you see anything
on his person. a length of rope. maybe?

308
00:20:39.791 --> 00:20:41.666
- None that I could see.
- Hmm.

309
00:20:43.791 --> 00:20:45.541
There was something. Uh…

310
00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:49.875
As Fry was leaving. I did ask
where he was off to at such an hour.

311
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.500
And?

312
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:54.500
He said. "Necessary business."

313
00:20:55.875 --> 00:20:57.458
What did you take that to mean?

314
00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:00.166
I don't know.

315
00:21:04.125 --> 00:21:06.625
- [Landor clears throat]
- Dismissed.

316
00:21:17.833 --> 00:21:19.750
- [cadet] Pardon me. captain.
- Yes.

317
00:21:30.291 --> 00:21:31.875
Christ almighty.

318
00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:37.416
"A cow and sheep have been
murdered and mutilated in Cold Spring."

319
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.000
"Their chests most cruelly carved open
and their hearts removed."

320
00:21:42.583 --> 00:21:45.583
Are any of God's creatures
immune from this man?

321
00:21:45.666 --> 00:21:48.208
We don't know that this is the same man.

322
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.125
What?

323
00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:52.416
Coincidence. is it?

324
00:21:55.625 --> 00:21:58.000
Effective 0600 tomorrow morning.

325
00:21:58.791 --> 00:22:03.291
all men will only attend
class. meals. prayer services.

326
00:22:04.125 --> 00:22:04.958
Nothing more!

327
00:22:15.541 --> 00:22:17.583
[Landor] If any of your classmates ask.

328
00:22:17.666 --> 00:22:20.583
we did nothing more than discuss
your acquaintance with Leroy Fry.

329
00:22:20.666 --> 00:22:23.166
[Poe] There was no acquaintance.
I never knew him.

330
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.041
- [Landor] What?
- I never knew the fellow.

331
00:22:25.583 --> 00:22:28.708
- [Landor] Then I misunderstood you.
- Huh. You're not the first.

332
00:22:29.458 --> 00:22:31.708
So. if this is not a discussion.
what is it?

333
00:22:32.916 --> 00:22:34.125
An offer of employment.

334
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.250
There's no pay.

335
00:22:37.208 --> 00:22:40.458
None of your classmates
may know what you're doing

336
00:22:40.541 --> 00:22:43.750
until long after you're done with it.

337
00:22:43.833 --> 00:22:47.583
If they do find out.
they'll likely curse your name.

338
00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:51.458
Oh! An irresistible offer.
[chuckles dryly]

339
00:22:51.541 --> 00:22:53.875
No. um. please. tell me more.

340
00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:59.500
Excellent. I need you to decipher this…
This segment of a larger note.

341
00:22:59.583 --> 00:23:04.000
You'll have to work secretly
and as precisely as you can.

342
00:23:14.666 --> 00:23:16.666
[melancholy music playing]

343
00:23:41.125 --> 00:23:43.125
[melancholy music continues]

344
00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:51.458
[knocking at door]

345
00:24:02.708 --> 00:24:06.791
I am pleased to report
I have successfully decoded your message.

346
00:24:07.833 --> 00:24:11.166
Hmm. Handwritten.
it is of a personal nature.

347
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.583
Fry had it with him
at the time of his death.

348
00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:15.833
From that.
we may presume it was sufficient

349
00:24:15.916 --> 00:24:19.083
to draw him from his barracks
on the night in question.

350
00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:22.208
As the rest of the message
was torn from his hand.

351
00:24:22.291 --> 00:24:25.875
we may presume that the note.
in some way. identified its sender.

352
00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:28.833
Now the use
of rather primitive black capitals

353
00:24:28.916 --> 00:24:32.750
would also indicate that the sender
wished to disguise his identity.

354
00:24:32.833 --> 00:24:38.666
An invitation of sorts. or might we
more accurately call it a trap. [claps]

355
00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:40.416
A trap?

356
00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:42.458
Hmm.

357
00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:45.916
- Now. with that in mind… Oh. may I?
- Mmm-hmm.

358
00:24:46.625 --> 00:24:49.708
Let's concentrate
our labors on the third line

359
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:51.833
which we know. for a fact. is complete.

360
00:24:51.916 --> 00:24:53.416
"Be." But be what?

361
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.541
Something that begins with "L."

362
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.458
"Little"? "Lucky"?

363
00:25:00.375 --> 00:25:04.125
No. Neither gibes with the invitation.

364
00:25:04.208 --> 00:25:09.000
"Be lost"?
No. No. Too ungainly a construction.

365
00:25:09.083 --> 00:25:13.125
If in fact Leroy Fry's attendance was
desired at a particular time and place.

366
00:25:13.208 --> 00:25:15.958
there is but one word. "late."

367
00:25:16.583 --> 00:25:18.958
"Be late."

368
00:25:19.666 --> 00:25:21.208
And as we scan the third line.

369
00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:26.041
the first word becomes almost
insultingly simple to deduce. "don't."

370
00:25:26.125 --> 00:25:29.625
So. "Don't be late."

371
00:25:31.541 --> 00:25:33.791
Now. look closely. Mr. Landor.

372
00:25:33.875 --> 00:25:36.333
We need not journey far
for a suitable candidate.

373
00:25:37.125 --> 00:25:40.333
If Fry is going
to a predetermined location.

374
00:25:40.416 --> 00:25:43.916
he was. from the perspective
of the writer. coming.

375
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.041
So. "Come. Mr. Fry."

376
00:25:47.125 --> 00:25:50.125
Now. with that in place.
it is the height of simplicity

377
00:25:50.208 --> 00:25:53.625
to deduce the next word.
Can it be any other than "soon"?

378
00:25:53.708 --> 00:25:56.125
We insert the word. <i>et voilà!</i>

379
00:25:56.208 --> 00:25:58.541
"Don't be late. Come soon."

380
00:25:58.625 --> 00:26:02.083
And there you have it.
the solution to our <i>petite énigme</i>

381
00:26:02.166 --> 00:26:05.083
{\an8}- respectfully submitted.
- Mmm-hmm.

382
00:26:10.875 --> 00:26:13.625
First-rate work. I thank you.

383
00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:16.333
- Just one thing.
- Yes?

384
00:26:16.416 --> 00:26:18.750
Did you have any luck
with the first two lines?

385
00:26:18.833 --> 00:26:21.416
Well. I was forced to declare them a loss.

386
00:26:22.416 --> 00:26:23.583
Are you a good speller?

387
00:26:23.666 --> 00:26:26.000
Oh. flawless. Judged so
by no less an authority

388
00:26:26.083 --> 00:26:29.250
than the Reverend John Bransby
of Stoke Newington.

389
00:26:29.333 --> 00:26:35.875
So I take it that you've never done
what so many of… us do.

390
00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:39.791
Misspell similar sounding words.

391
00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:46.916
For example.
"they're." "their." and "there."

392
00:26:48.416 --> 00:26:50.000
A common solecism.

393
00:26:50.083 --> 00:26:52.625
An invitation indeed. "Meet me there."

394
00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:57.125
Of course. we still don't know
where to meet. do we?

395
00:26:58.208 --> 00:27:02.041
Something with "N-G" trailing behind.

396
00:27:04.041 --> 00:27:04.958
The landing!

397
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:09.750
- And might I add. the cove by the landing.
- Excellent choice.

398
00:27:09.833 --> 00:27:14.958
So. "I'll be at the cove by the landing."

399
00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:17.125
"Meet me there at say. 11:00 p.m. or so."

400
00:27:17.208 --> 00:27:21.541
So. "Don't be late. Come see me."
Might be closer to the mark.

401
00:27:21.625 --> 00:27:23.041
- [Poe] Yeah.
- Ah…

402
00:27:23.125 --> 00:27:25.166
Does this suggest anything to you?

403
00:27:25.666 --> 00:27:28.083
Why would he meet
a fellow cadet at the landing

404
00:27:28.958 --> 00:27:30.541
- when you can meet him anywhere?
- Hmm.

405
00:27:32.958 --> 00:27:37.500
Because it's not a cadet. but a woman.

406
00:27:37.583 --> 00:27:38.416
[Landor] Hmm.

407
00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:43.500
You knew the solution
all along. Mr. Landor.

408
00:27:43.583 --> 00:27:44.708
I had an idea.

409
00:27:45.583 --> 00:27:49.125
Well. if this is indeed a woman we seek.

410
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:54.083
I believe I may be credited
with a sighting of her.

411
00:27:56.083 --> 00:28:00.625
The morning after Leroy Fry's death.
before I knew anything of what had passed.

412
00:28:02.541 --> 00:28:07.250
I awoke. and began speaking
the opening lines of a poem.

413
00:28:09.125 --> 00:28:14.041
<i>lines that speak of a mysterious woman</i>
<i>in profound distress.</i>

414
00:28:14.875 --> 00:28:20.625
<i>Then. just outside the mess.</i>
<i>appears the most beautiful creature</i>

415
00:28:20.708 --> 00:28:23.041
<i>I've ever had the pleasure</i>
<i>of laying eyes on.</i>

416
00:28:28.541 --> 00:28:29.750
[Landor] <i>Who was she?</i>

417
00:28:31.125 --> 00:28:32.958
I haven't the faintest.

418
00:28:33.041 --> 00:28:37.791
But why do you believe that this poem
or young woman are connected with Mr. Fry?

419
00:28:37.875 --> 00:28:39.916
The air of concealed violence.

420
00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:43.625
Unspeakable duress.

421
00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:46.750
An unknown woman.

422
00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:51.291
You could have woken
any morning and written this.

423
00:28:52.041 --> 00:28:55.166
But I didn't write it. It was dictated.

424
00:28:55.791 --> 00:28:57.458
- Dictated?
- Mmm-hmm.

425
00:28:59.291 --> 00:29:00.125
By whom?

426
00:29:02.666 --> 00:29:03.500
My mother.

427
00:29:07.041 --> 00:29:08.041
She's dead.

428
00:29:09.833 --> 00:29:12.083
Dead nearly. uh. 20 years.

429
00:29:19.416 --> 00:29:21.750
[Landor] <i>Tell me about this Poe fella.</i>

430
00:29:24.583 --> 00:29:26.000
Oh. Poe. he…

431
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.541
A lovely boy.

432
00:29:31.416 --> 00:29:35.583
Beautiful manners. Um… Talks a lot.

433
00:29:35.666 --> 00:29:40.583
Definitely. And definitely
something peculiar about him.

434
00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.791
[chuckling] Because he talks a lot?

435
00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:45.291
No. because he's filled
with senseless fantasies.

436
00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:48.000
Tells me about a poem.

437
00:29:48.083 --> 00:29:51.916
claims it has something
to do with Leroy Fry's death.

438
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.958
Claims it was dictated to him
in his sleep by his dead mother.

439
00:30:05.541 --> 00:30:10.375
You of all people know
that the people we lost…

440
00:30:12.541 --> 00:30:14.125
are always with us.

441
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:23.625
Man will do most anything
to cheat death. won't he?

442
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:27.541
[pensive music playing]

443
00:30:37.958 --> 00:30:39.541
[creaking]

444
00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:23.166
[Dr. Marquis] <i>A container of some sort.</i>

445
00:31:23.916 --> 00:31:27.708
<i>Wrapped in muslin. maybe. or newspaper.</i>

446
00:31:28.291 --> 00:31:30.375
<i>Very likely surrounded by ice.</i>

447
00:31:34.041 --> 00:31:36.041
[pensive music continues]

448
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.250
[music swells]

449
00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:19.750
[lock clicks]

450
00:32:26.166 --> 00:32:27.000
[creaking]

451
00:32:27.083 --> 00:32:29.000
[music fades]

452
00:32:29.083 --> 00:32:30.500
[water trickling]

453
00:32:33.958 --> 00:32:35.208
[floorboard creaking]

454
00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:57.708
- [pigeons cooing]
- [wings fluttering]

455
00:33:03.458 --> 00:33:04.583
[hollow thump]

456
00:33:11.666 --> 00:33:12.708
[hollow thudding]

457
00:33:38.958 --> 00:33:40.958
[unsettling music building]

458
00:33:58.541 --> 00:33:59.666
[foot scraping]

459
00:34:28.791 --> 00:34:30.791
[unsettling music continues]

460
00:34:49.875 --> 00:34:51.791
[footsteps approaching]

461
00:34:51.875 --> 00:34:55.000
Good. My note reached you.

462
00:34:55.083 --> 00:34:56.791
- Were you followed?
- Followed?

463
00:34:57.375 --> 00:34:59.708
How unprofessional. Certainly not.

464
00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:05.791
- What is this?
- The scene of the crime.

465
00:35:06.541 --> 00:35:08.833
The second… crime.

466
00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:12.750
Where Fry's heart was brought.

467
00:35:13.416 --> 00:35:16.500
You mentioned the taking
of Fry's heart drew you to the Bible.

468
00:35:16.583 --> 00:35:19.208
I must admit.
I was already moving in that direction.

469
00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:21.916
Not to the Bible.

470
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.333
But to religion.

471
00:35:25.833 --> 00:35:30.291
This… This does appear to render
a ceremony of some sort.

472
00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:33.875
Blood and candles placed
in an intentional manner.

473
00:35:38.166 --> 00:35:41.291
- A circle.
- Mmm. And a triangle.

474
00:35:42.916 --> 00:35:47.833
And Fry's heart very likely placed inside.

475
00:35:53.541 --> 00:35:56.708
I have an old friend
who might be of some use.

476
00:35:59.166 --> 00:36:01.166
[pensive music playing]

477
00:36:04.625 --> 00:36:09.000
[Landor] <i>Professor Jean Pépé</i>
<i>is an expert in symbols…</i>

478
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:10.791
- [Landor] Pépé!
<i>- …rituals…</i>

479
00:36:10.875 --> 00:36:12.000
[knocking at door]

480
00:36:12.083 --> 00:36:14.083
<i>- …the occult.</i>
- Professor!

481
00:36:14.166 --> 00:36:15.083
[Landor] <i>Pépé might be</i>

482
00:36:15.166 --> 00:36:17.541
<i>- the most peculiar man…</i>
- [Pépé] Come in. I'm back here.

483
00:36:17.625 --> 00:36:20.583
- [Landor] Sorry to intrude.
<i>- …I've had the pleasure of coming across.</i>

484
00:36:20.666 --> 00:36:24.625
[Landor] I. uh. bring something curious
I would like you to observe.

485
00:36:25.166 --> 00:36:26.041
[Pépé] Uh…

486
00:36:27.291 --> 00:36:30.041
This can only be a magic circle.

487
00:36:31.083 --> 00:36:34.208
I remember seeing it in
<i>Le Véritable Dragon Rouge.</i>

488
00:36:34.291 --> 00:36:37.708
And if I recall all right.
the magician would stand there

489
00:36:39.041 --> 00:36:40.333
in the triangle.

490
00:36:41.166 --> 00:36:42.083
Alone?

491
00:36:42.166 --> 00:36:44.833
Well. he might have
a group of assistants.

492
00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:47.875
And candles and torches
on either side. light everywhere.

493
00:36:47.958 --> 00:36:49.916
a festival of light. in fact.

494
00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:55.416
Now. Gus. if you go to the third shelf…

495
00:36:56.375 --> 00:36:58.125
On the second to the top.

496
00:36:59.166 --> 00:37:01.125
That volume on the top.

497
00:37:02.916 --> 00:37:05.375
Yes. Yes.

498
00:37:08.583 --> 00:37:11.583
Pierre de Lancre.
redoubtable witch hunter.

499
00:37:13.833 --> 00:37:17.375
- You read French. Mr. Poe?
- Well. yes.

500
00:37:17.458 --> 00:37:20.208
Please read in silence.
It's in the center page.

501
00:37:22.708 --> 00:37:25.875
De Lancre executed 600 Basque witches

502
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.666
and left behind
the remarkable volume you now peruse.

503
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:34.291
But the book I wish to give you.
<i>Discours du Diable</i> by Henri Le Clerc.

504
00:37:34.958 --> 00:37:38.125
who executed 700 witches
before he was done.

505
00:37:38.208 --> 00:37:39.958
is reputed to have been destroyed.

506
00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:44.541
Now. rumor has it that he left behind
two or three other volumes

507
00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:46.875
identical to the one destroyed.

508
00:37:47.958 --> 00:37:53.000
Now. finding one has become
the <i>idée fixe</i> of many an occult collector.

509
00:37:53.583 --> 00:37:57.333
- Why?
- Why? Ooh… [chuckles]

510
00:37:57.416 --> 00:38:01.958
Le Clerc left behind instructions
for securing…

511
00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.250
immortality.

512
00:38:05.666 --> 00:38:06.875
[Poe] Oh. my Lord.

513
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:13.125
"It is commonly known
among the fraternity of evil angels

514
00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:16.833
that the contents
of a witch's sabbath feast

515
00:38:16.916 --> 00:38:20.041
are confined to the following sundries."

516
00:38:20.125 --> 00:38:24.458
"Unclean animals such as are
never eaten by Christian peoples.

517
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.291
the hearts of unbaptized children.

518
00:38:30.166 --> 00:38:33.333
and the hearts of hanged men."

519
00:38:40.375 --> 00:38:41.375
[drum roll]

520
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.958
[Landor] <i>I need you</i>
<i>to discretely infiltrate the cadets.</i>

521
00:38:50.041 --> 00:38:53.500
<i>see if you can ferret out which of them</i>
<i>may have a connection to the occult.</i>

522
00:38:54.625 --> 00:38:55.708
[Lee] <i>Explain yourself.</i>

523
00:38:55.791 --> 00:38:59.125
Well. um. certain overtures
have been made to me.

524
00:38:59.208 --> 00:39:01.958
rather dark. and shall I say.
unchristian overtures.

525
00:39:02.041 --> 00:39:03.000
- Unchristian?
- Yes.

526
00:39:03.083 --> 00:39:06.000
I've been spurred to question
the very grounds of my faith.

527
00:39:06.083 --> 00:39:09.833
And to dabble in mysterious and arcane
practices of an ancient provenance.

528
00:39:09.916 --> 00:39:12.791
- Arcane practices?
- He means black magic. Who was it?

529
00:39:12.875 --> 00:39:14.375
[clears throat] I demand to know.

530
00:39:14.458 --> 00:39:16.208
[Poe] I'm honor bound
not to reveal his name.

531
00:39:16.291 --> 00:39:17.125
[Lee] Who was it?

532
00:39:17.208 --> 00:39:18.416
You can't drag it from me.

533
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.666
not if God himself threatened
to smite me with a lightning bolt.

534
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.333
- If you want to join our prayers--
- No. I gave my word.

535
00:39:24.416 --> 00:39:27.166
- One asks you to question your faith--
- It must stay private.

536
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:28.333
Was it Marquis?

537
00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:30.458
Hamilton. watch yourself.

538
00:39:31.916 --> 00:39:34.791
[Poe]<i> Yes. I have a name.</i>
<i>but I need a face to go with it.</i>

539
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.083
- [Dr. Marquis] Vertigo. hmm?
- Mmm.

540
00:39:47.333 --> 00:39:49.666
Well. things are swirling about.

541
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:52.625
Your heart rate is rather quick.

542
00:39:54.875 --> 00:39:58.375
Very well. Mr. Poe.
keep to the house today

543
00:39:58.458 --> 00:40:00.125
and take care of yourself.

544
00:40:01.125 --> 00:40:05.791
Present this to Lieutenant Locke
and his cadet commandeer.

545
00:40:05.875 --> 00:40:08.041
Artemus. my son.

546
00:40:09.166 --> 00:40:12.333
He'll make sure
you're relieved of your duties.

547
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:18.250
[Locke] You wish to be excused
from class because you were feeling

548
00:40:19.166 --> 00:40:20.333
vertiginous?

549
00:40:20.916 --> 00:40:23.375
And an even worse ailment not noted.

550
00:40:24.083 --> 00:40:25.458
A grand ennui seizure.

551
00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:27.958
"Grand ennui"?

552
00:40:28.041 --> 00:40:30.416
Of a most pronounced character.

553
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.000
Mind yourself. Poe.

554
00:40:32.083 --> 00:40:33.875
You may ask the doctor yourself.

555
00:40:37.375 --> 00:40:38.500
It's true. Lieutenant.

556
00:40:39.166 --> 00:40:41.791
My father did tell me
he's never seen anything quite like it.

557
00:40:41.875 --> 00:40:42.875
Very well.

558
00:40:44.083 --> 00:40:47.166
But I am charging you
with unbecoming brazenness.

559
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:48.666
Three demerits.

560
00:40:49.291 --> 00:40:51.666
Return at once to your quarters.

561
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:54.833
And you would best be there when
the officers come around for inspection.

562
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.458
[drill sergeant shouting commands]

563
00:41:08.708 --> 00:41:10.916
- Poe. is it?
- Yes.

564
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.375
Artemus Marquis.

565
00:41:13.208 --> 00:41:16.000
I must say. your brazenness is admirable.

566
00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:21.083
Tonight. eleven o'clock.
18 North Barracks.

567
00:41:25.625 --> 00:41:28.916
[Poe] Apologies for my tardiness.
I hope I haven't kept you too long.

568
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:31.708
This is lovely.

569
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.208
[gasps] Books!

570
00:41:40.583 --> 00:41:42.458
You have never interested me more.

571
00:41:43.208 --> 00:41:45.625
Where to begin? Oh…

572
00:41:47.375 --> 00:41:51.958
The lamentable Fenimore Cooper.
I guess every library must have one.

573
00:41:52.833 --> 00:41:54.416
Ooh. what a collection.

574
00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:58.041
History of Egypt. and all sorts.

575
00:42:05.041 --> 00:42:06.416
You've been found out.

576
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.333
Oh?

577
00:42:08.916 --> 00:42:11.000
You gave me to understand
you didn't read poetry.

578
00:42:11.583 --> 00:42:12.791
I don't.

579
00:42:14.916 --> 00:42:15.916
Byron!

580
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:19.916
- A personal favorite. Mr. Landor…
- Please.

581
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
…and might I say. terribly well-thumbed.

582
00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:23.708
That's my daughter's.

583
00:42:31.708 --> 00:42:32.541
[clears throat]

584
00:42:35.166 --> 00:42:37.375
And your daughter is no longer here?

585
00:42:37.458 --> 00:42:40.958
No. No. she ran off with someone.

586
00:42:42.666 --> 00:42:43.541
Someone you knew?

587
00:42:44.916 --> 00:42:45.875
In passing.

588
00:42:46.916 --> 00:42:48.291
And she's never to return?

589
00:42:50.791 --> 00:42:51.791
Not likely.

590
00:42:53.208 --> 00:42:55.416
Then we're both alone in this world.

591
00:42:57.125 --> 00:42:58.541
But you have your mother.

592
00:43:00.375 --> 00:43:01.833
She still speaks to you.

593
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.208
- At any rate.
- [chuckling] Yes.

594
00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:06.541
Yes. from time to time.

595
00:43:07.375 --> 00:43:12.541
And I might add. whatever's good in me.
in person. in spirit. comes from her.

596
00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:19.250
Your daughter. What's her name?
If you don't object.

597
00:43:21.541 --> 00:43:22.583
Mathilde.

598
00:43:25.875 --> 00:43:26.875
Mattie.

599
00:43:30.333 --> 00:43:32.333
You needn't say anymore. Mr. Landor.

600
00:43:36.208 --> 00:43:40.583
- So you say you found something.
- Well. no. Better than that.

601
00:43:40.666 --> 00:43:43.916
Someone goes by the name Marquis.

602
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.416
The doctor.

603
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.000
No. His son. Artemus.

604
00:43:48.541 --> 00:43:53.000
And I have tasked myself with maneuvering
into his impenetrable peer group.

605
00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:54.458
[door opens]

606
00:43:55.208 --> 00:43:57.541
[Stoddard] Here's another
good creature of God.

607
00:43:59.083 --> 00:44:01.250
Courtesy of <i>la</i> divine Patsy.

608
00:44:02.416 --> 00:44:05.750
[Ballinger] Are you going to report us
for defying curfew. Poe?

609
00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:11.375
Do our wee transgressions offend thee?

610
00:44:11.458 --> 00:44:17.833
Not only am I not offended.
Mr. Ballinger. but. mmm…

611
00:44:19.666 --> 00:44:21.625
another round is in order.

612
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.791
[Artemus chuckles]

613
00:44:27.708 --> 00:44:28.583
[Ballinger] Drink it.

614
00:44:30.416 --> 00:44:31.833
All of it. woman.

615
00:44:31.916 --> 00:44:34.541
[Stoddard] Ballinger. you really
are quite the bully tonight.

616
00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:35.458
[Poe] Mmm.

617
00:44:37.833 --> 00:44:39.083
Another. <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

618
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:44.375
Oh. I thank you.

619
00:44:46.166 --> 00:44:47.000
Mmm.

620
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.458
- I can do this all night.
- [Artemus] Uh-uh.

621
00:44:50.708 --> 00:44:51.708
Easy. Ballinger.

622
00:44:52.708 --> 00:44:55.041
I've gone to great trouble
to secure that mash.

623
00:44:56.125 --> 00:44:56.958
Poe.

624
00:44:58.125 --> 00:45:00.000
I understand you're a published poet.

625
00:45:00.833 --> 00:45:03.541
I am told I evidence a humble gift.

626
00:45:04.083 --> 00:45:06.791
[chuckles] Well. then I demand
a public reading.

627
00:45:07.666 --> 00:45:09.750
- Pleasure us.
- Oh. [chuckles]

628
00:45:13.833 --> 00:45:16.791
<i>I met a lewd nude in Bermuda</i>

629
00:45:17.458 --> 00:45:19.208
<i>Who thought she was shrewd</i>

630
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:21.250
<i>I was shrewder</i>

631
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.791
<i>She thought it quite crude</i>
<i>To be wooed in the nude</i>

632
00:45:25.875 --> 00:45:28.416
<i>I pursued her</i>
<i>Subdued her and screwed her</i>

633
00:45:29.458 --> 00:45:31.125
- [laughing]
- Well done. Poe.

634
00:45:31.875 --> 00:45:32.875
Bravo.

635
00:45:36.291 --> 00:45:39.083
Losing card… is a seven.

636
00:45:40.083 --> 00:45:42.333
Winning card… is a jack.

637
00:45:43.458 --> 00:45:44.333
Oh!

638
00:45:44.416 --> 00:45:46.541
[Artemus] Well. well. well.
It's your lucky day. Poe.

639
00:45:47.208 --> 00:45:48.083
Thank you.

640
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Is it true. Poe. that Detective Landor
interrogated you about Fry?

641
00:45:54.458 --> 00:45:59.208
He was mistakenly under the impression
that I was an intimate of Fry's.

642
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.500
Were you?

643
00:46:03.291 --> 00:46:04.125
I was not.

644
00:46:04.833 --> 00:46:08.041
Fitting that the only thing
that Fry could do to gain attention

645
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:10.541
was to hang himself.

646
00:46:11.833 --> 00:46:15.708
[Stoddard] I think he hanged himself
in despair over being jilted by a lady.

647
00:46:15.791 --> 00:46:17.791
[Lee] And what lady
might that be. Stoddard?

648
00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:19.708
[Ballinger] What of your sister. Artemus?

649
00:46:20.791 --> 00:46:23.000
Didn't she dazzle Fry?

650
00:46:25.875 --> 00:46:27.333
[Artemus] Oh. come now. Randy.

651
00:46:28.041 --> 00:46:30.500
You were closer to Fry
than anyone in this room.

652
00:46:30.583 --> 00:46:33.750
I don't believe
I was so near to him… [inhales]

653
00:46:33.833 --> 00:46:34.750
…as you.

654
00:46:42.541 --> 00:46:44.791
[chuckles]

655
00:46:49.541 --> 00:46:52.166
All right. Where were we?

656
00:46:52.791 --> 00:46:54.416
[bell tolling in distance]

657
00:47:21.083 --> 00:47:22.291
Halt!

658
00:47:23.958 --> 00:47:26.250
Curfew not apply to you. Mr. Poe?

659
00:47:27.375 --> 00:47:28.541
Explain yourself.

660
00:47:28.625 --> 00:47:32.000
Candles were
to be extinguished three hours ago.

661
00:47:32.083 --> 00:47:33.750
[clears throat] I'm sorry. sir.

662
00:47:35.125 --> 00:47:37.958
Your apologies have always
rung hollow with me.

663
00:47:38.875 --> 00:47:42.375
Leroy Fry met his maker
when he too was out after curfew.

664
00:47:44.541 --> 00:47:46.750
Return to barracks at once.

665
00:47:48.583 --> 00:47:50.916
You're lucky you're not
digging your own grave.

666
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.458
Thank you. sir.

667
00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:55.666
Pick up the pace.

668
00:48:00.791 --> 00:48:02.041
[soft scraping]

669
00:48:07.041 --> 00:48:09.250
[Mathilde muttering indistinctly]

670
00:48:20.916 --> 00:48:22.333
[muttering continues]

671
00:48:32.666 --> 00:48:33.625
[sniffles]

672
00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:35.458
[whispers] Mattie?

673
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:46.041
[exhales shakily]

674
00:48:53.208 --> 00:48:54.833
[wardrobe opens]

675
00:48:56.625 --> 00:48:57.666
[sighs softly]

676
00:48:58.708 --> 00:49:01.500
[melancholy music playing]

677
00:49:01.583 --> 00:49:02.958
[sobbing]

678
00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:07.666
[sniffling]

679
00:49:19.166 --> 00:49:21.166
[melancholy music continues]

680
00:49:31.708 --> 00:49:34.666
[imperceptible]

681
00:49:40.708 --> 00:49:41.541
[sniffles]

682
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:50.000
[music fades]

683
00:49:50.083 --> 00:49:55.000
[priest] "Remember thou me
for thy goodness' sake. O Lord."

684
00:49:55.833 --> 00:49:59.333
"For in death
there is no remembrance of thee.

685
00:49:59.916 --> 00:50:03.500
in thy grave who shall give thee thanks?"

686
00:50:04.791 --> 00:50:06.375
"According to thy mercy.

687
00:50:06.916 --> 00:50:11.041
remember thou me
for thy goodness' sake. O Lord."

688
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.250
"Mine eye is consumed because of grief."

689
00:50:18.875 --> 00:50:21.708
You're Mr. Landor. Aren't you?

690
00:50:22.375 --> 00:50:23.208
I am.

691
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.125
[sniffles] I'm Leroy's mother.

692
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:31.666
I'd like you to have this. [sniffles]

693
00:50:32.291 --> 00:50:33.166
Leroy's diary.

694
00:50:34.625 --> 00:50:36.875
It goes back at least three years.

695
00:50:37.541 --> 00:50:39.166
I don't recall…

696
00:50:40.291 --> 00:50:41.375
I'm sorry.

697
00:50:43.083 --> 00:50:44.166
Terrible loss.

698
00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:50.916
I don't recall any diary
being found with his personal effects.

699
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.875
It was Mr. Ballinger who sent it to me.

700
00:50:53.958 --> 00:50:55.250
- Mr. Ballinger?
- Yes.

701
00:50:55.916 --> 00:50:58.000
As soon as he heard what had happened.

702
00:50:58.083 --> 00:51:01.625
he went straight to Leroy's quarters
to see what could be done.

703
00:51:01.708 --> 00:51:03.458
The dear boy mailed it to me. [sobs]

704
00:51:03.541 --> 00:51:04.375
I see.

705
00:51:04.875 --> 00:51:08.750
And just now… as soon as he saw me.

706
00:51:09.875 --> 00:51:14.583
he said. "I thought you should have
Leroy's diary with you in Kentucky."

707
00:51:15.416 --> 00:51:17.958
"And if you feel like burning it.
go right ahead."

708
00:51:19.291 --> 00:51:20.583
How considerate of him.

709
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.291
But I can make no sense of it.

710
00:51:24.208 --> 00:51:25.750
All the numbers and letters…

711
00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:30.875
But… seeing how the Army
is depending on you.

712
00:51:30.958 --> 00:51:33.625
it seems only right
that you should have it.

713
00:51:44.166 --> 00:51:46.166
[pensive music playing]

714
00:52:05.583 --> 00:52:08.875
[Julia] I'll be back to meet you
all the time.

715
00:52:08.958 --> 00:52:10.875
- To manage her needs…
- [Dr. Marquis] I understand.

716
00:52:10.958 --> 00:52:12.875
…'cause all of us are in this together.

717
00:52:14.041 --> 00:52:15.083
[Landor] Doctor!

718
00:52:15.875 --> 00:52:19.541
[Dr. Marquis] Ah. Mr. Landor.
What a pleasant surprise.

719
00:52:20.125 --> 00:52:23.875
Uh. please. let me introduce you
to my wife. Julia.

720
00:52:25.333 --> 00:52:27.625
I've heard so much about you.

721
00:52:27.708 --> 00:52:29.125
It's a pleasure.

722
00:52:29.208 --> 00:52:32.958
Aren't you the gentleman
inquiring after Mr. Fry's death?

723
00:52:33.833 --> 00:52:34.666
I am.

724
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:36.833
Well. we were just discussing the matter.

725
00:52:37.458 --> 00:52:43.666
Indeed. my husband informs me
that despite his own heroic efforts.

726
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:49.625
the body of Mr. Fry had been judged
too far along for public display.

727
00:52:50.541 --> 00:52:51.375
Hmm.

728
00:52:52.083 --> 00:52:54.208
His poor parents.

729
00:52:54.708 --> 00:52:55.708
Oh. Indeed.

730
00:52:55.791 --> 00:52:58.916
Well. this whole matter has shaken us.

731
00:53:00.916 --> 00:53:03.916
Be assured. I won't rest
until we've apprehended him.

732
00:53:08.708 --> 00:53:10.708
Lovely to make your acquaintance.

733
00:53:11.416 --> 00:53:12.500
My dear.

734
00:53:12.583 --> 00:53:15.833
I understand you're a widower. Mr. Landor.

735
00:53:17.708 --> 00:53:18.916
That is so.

736
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.708
Well. all due sympathy.

737
00:53:22.333 --> 00:53:25.833
Was it recent?
Your wife going to her reward?

738
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:27.541
Two years ago now.

739
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:33.041
Only a few months
after we moved to the Highlands.

740
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:35.916
A sudden illness. was it?

741
00:53:38.458 --> 00:53:39.291
Not sudden…

742
00:53:40.833 --> 00:53:41.666
enough.

743
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:46.375
Well. your sacrifices aren't lost on me.

744
00:53:47.583 --> 00:53:50.000
- Condolences.
- Thank you.

745
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:52.083
[Julia] Hmm.

746
00:53:59.208 --> 00:54:02.458
- [piano playing]
- [wind whistling]

747
00:54:27.416 --> 00:54:28.333
Brava.

748
00:54:29.375 --> 00:54:32.166
Edgar. did I not tell you
my sister is a prodigy?

749
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:35.500
Marvelous. my dear.
Brought a tear to my eye.

750
00:54:35.583 --> 00:54:36.458
[Poe] Yeah.

751
00:54:37.041 --> 00:54:39.125
A lovely run. Miss Marquis.

752
00:54:39.208 --> 00:54:40.666
- Truly.
- Yes.

753
00:54:41.333 --> 00:54:43.375
Your immortality is assured.

754
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.958
I can't think of any woman
who wishes to be immortal. Randy.

755
00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:50.375
I am at once reminded
of Sir Thomas Grey's.

756
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.750
<i>"Full many a flower</i>
<i>Is born to blush unseen"</i>

757
00:54:53.833 --> 00:54:56.583
<i>"And waste its sweetness</i>
<i>On the desert air"</i>

758
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.041
A favorite. Mr. Poe.

759
00:55:02.083 --> 00:55:05.250
And what do you think
of my little protégé?

760
00:55:06.166 --> 00:55:08.791
I think Mr. Poe is far beyond
being anyone's protégé.

761
00:55:09.625 --> 00:55:12.000
He's certainly not to be corrupted
by the likes of you.

762
00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:14.750
[cadets chuckle]

763
00:55:14.833 --> 00:55:15.833
[Julia] All right. Lea.

764
00:55:15.916 --> 00:55:19.333
That's enough now.
You need to rest before dinner.

765
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.875
- [coughs] If you'll excuse me. gentlemen.
- [Ballinger] Thank you. Lea.

766
00:55:24.625 --> 00:55:25.875
[Artemus] Randy. chairs.

767
00:55:26.583 --> 00:55:28.208
Stoddard. come on. man. Chess board.

768
00:55:29.958 --> 00:55:31.208
All right. I'm bored now.

769
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:33.541
[Julia] I don't care! She's ill.

770
00:55:33.625 --> 00:55:36.125
In her condition.
she shouldn't be entertaining at all.

771
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:37.708
[Poe] Miss Marquis.

772
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:40.750
Oh. um… Pardon me.

773
00:55:44.833 --> 00:55:49.916
Nothing would afford me greater pleasure
than an audience with you on Saturday.

774
00:55:51.791 --> 00:55:56.291
I'm sure that's true. Mr. Poe.
but… I'm afraid I'm engaged Saturday.

775
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.208
Ah. I see.

776
00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:01.375
[in French]
Your coat and your hat. sir.

777
00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:04.250
Thank you. Eugenia. You needn't have.

778
00:56:04.333 --> 00:56:06.833
I could have fetched my coat myself.

779
00:56:06.916 --> 00:56:08.833
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

780
00:56:11.208 --> 00:56:13.000
You speak French. Mr. Poe.

781
00:56:14.041 --> 00:56:16.666
With an accent that is rather charming.

782
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:24.083
[in English] So you propose this Saturday?

783
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:28.041
Or Sunday. if that's preferable.

784
00:56:29.916 --> 00:56:30.916
Or Monday. even.

785
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.250
And where do you propose this audience?

786
00:56:33.333 --> 00:56:35.916
Let me guess.
Gee's Point? Flirtation Walk?

787
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Oh. no. no. no.

788
00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:38.875
Neither. I'm afraid. no.

789
00:56:39.708 --> 00:56:41.458
I had in mind the cemetery.

790
00:56:42.333 --> 00:56:43.833
- The cemetery?
- Mmm.

791
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.333
How interesting.

792
00:56:47.416 --> 00:56:48.750
Yes. I certainly think so.

793
00:56:51.666 --> 00:56:53.541
Well. I wish you good evening.

794
00:56:54.375 --> 00:56:56.375
[intriguing music playing]

795
00:57:03.666 --> 00:57:04.500
[door closes]

796
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:53.708
[Lea] <i>It's all so bare now.</i>

797
00:57:54.625 --> 00:57:57.750
But to enjoy the Highlands
in the full extent of their glory.

798
00:57:58.291 --> 00:58:01.541
it must be seen immediately
after the fall of the leaf.

799
00:58:02.583 --> 00:58:03.416
Why is that?

800
00:58:04.125 --> 00:58:06.083
Vegetation does not improve.

801
00:58:06.166 --> 00:58:09.541
but rather obstructs
God's originating design.

802
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:11.458
A romantic.

803
00:58:12.916 --> 00:58:16.000
You do enjoy talking
about God and death. don't you?

804
00:58:16.625 --> 00:58:20.291
I do consider death
to be poetry's most exalted theme.

805
00:58:21.833 --> 00:58:23.833
[coughing]

806
00:58:28.208 --> 00:58:29.208
Shall we?

807
00:58:33.708 --> 00:58:36.041
- A lovely spot.
- [sighs] Yes. it's my favorite.

808
00:58:41.333 --> 00:58:44.333
How well it sits on you. morbidity.

809
00:58:46.125 --> 00:58:47.875
Suits you better than your uniform.

810
00:58:50.583 --> 00:58:52.666
The only one to match you is Artemus.

811
00:58:54.041 --> 00:58:57.333
I've never seen him dwell
in the realms of melancholy.

812
00:58:58.875 --> 00:59:02.041
He does consent
to visit our world for long intervals.

813
00:59:13.916 --> 00:59:16.541
[Lea] <i>You know I believe it's possible</i>
<i>to dance on broken glass</i>

814
00:59:16.625 --> 00:59:18.250
<i>for some length of time.</i>

815
00:59:18.916 --> 00:59:20.125
Not forever.

816
00:59:24.958 --> 00:59:27.583
Yes. I can see you two
hold much in common.

817
00:59:28.875 --> 00:59:31.166
[coughing]

818
00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:37.166
I hope you aren't cold.

[unsettling music playing]

820
00:59:40.208 --> 00:59:42.458
The frigid climate
has clearly settled in for good.

821
00:59:42.541 --> 00:59:43.541
Please. let us not.

822
00:59:44.166 --> 00:59:47.166
Do not suppose I came here
to talk about the weather. How prosaic.

823
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.666
I'm sorry.
My sole concern was for your welfare.

824
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:52.000
Proceed then. by all means.

825
00:59:52.083 --> 00:59:55.750
Declare your undying love. so we may
both return home and be none the worse.

826
00:59:55.833 --> 00:59:58.458
- I was just saying--
- I'm sorry.

827
00:59:59.708 --> 01:00:02.166
Sorry. I'm being a horror.
and I have no idea why.

828
01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:06.333
You are cold.

829
01:00:06.416 --> 01:00:08.791
Miss Marquis. would you
like to borrow my cloak?

830
01:00:09.791 --> 01:00:11.750
- Quite all right.
- It's really no. um…

831
01:00:11.833 --> 01:00:12.666
I…

832
01:00:13.625 --> 01:00:14.708
[gulps]

833
01:00:14.791 --> 01:00:16.000
- What?
- Miss Marquis.

834
01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:18.541
- Lea! Lea!
- [whimpering]

835

01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:25.541
Lea! Lea? What's happening?

838
01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:26.458
Lea!

839
01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:29.708
Lea.

840
01:00:30.416 --> 01:00:31.250
[choking stops]

841
01:00:31.833 --> 01:00:33.083
[breathing deeply]

842
01:00:37.916 --> 01:00:39.083
My God. Lea.

843
01:00:40.666 --> 01:00:41.833
Are you all right?

844
01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:46.083
- Lea?
- I'm rather fine.

845
01:00:56.666 --> 01:01:00.458
[Poe] <i>Are you sure you're all right?</i>
<i>I was quite terrified.</i>

846
01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:03.625
[Lea] <i>It happens.</i>
<i>It's nothing to worry about.</i>

847
01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:06.125
Your. um…

848
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:12.916
Your spirit so emboldens me
that I feel free to confess…

849
01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:19.458
my mother has
a kind of presence in my life.

850
01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:23.583
My sleepings and my awakenings.

851
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.833
Yes. Yes.

852
01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:31.083
At times. I believe the dead haunt us
because we love them too little.

853
01:01:32.416 --> 01:01:36.250
We forget them. you see.
We don't mean to. but we do.

854
01:01:37.291 --> 01:01:42.833
I believe they feel most cruelly deserted.
and so they clamor for us.

855
01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:47.083
Perhaps it best we don't give
that too much thought.

856
01:01:58.291 --> 01:02:00.208
I want you to know how grateful I was…

857
01:02:02.833 --> 01:02:04.625
to open my eyes and find you there.

858
01:02:05.916 --> 01:02:07.291
To look deep within you

859
01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:10.583
and find something
I would never have expected.

860
01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:13.666
Not in a thousand years.

861
01:02:15.666 --> 01:02:16.666
Thank you.

862
01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:28.750
[animals howling]

[howling continues]

865

[rustling]

866
01:03:04.541 --> 01:03:06.250
[Poe grunts]

867
01:03:06.333 --> 01:03:08.875
- [man grunting]
- [Poe groaning]

868
01:03:08.958 --> 01:03:10.375
[coughing]

869
01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:11.333
[choking]

870
01:03:12.333 --> 01:03:14.500
[groans] Stop!

871
01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:15.916
[grunts]

872
01:03:16.583 --> 01:03:18.666
[gasping. panting]

873
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:20.708
[groaning]

874
01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:26.041
Bastards ought to know
their fucking place.

875
01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:31.083
- [Poe groaning]
- [Ballinger] Stay away from Lea.

876
01:03:32.333 --> 01:03:33.791
[Landor grunts]

877
01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:34.708
Leave off!

878
01:03:34.791 --> 01:03:37.000
- [Ballinger grunts]
- [Poe groaning]

879
01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:38.208
[Landor grunts]

880
01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:39.500
Leave off. Ballinger!

881
01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:42.958
Or you will be court-martialed!

882
01:03:43.541 --> 01:03:44.541
[Poe groans]

883
01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:56.500
[Ballinger] Ugly fuck.

884
01:04:01.166 --> 01:04:02.166
[Landor] You all right?

885
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:06.000
Clearly that savage knows
that Lea prefers me to him.

886
01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:08.416
- And if he seeks to frighten me away--
- Frighten?

887
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.541
- He looked set on killing you.
- Killing me? Oh!

888
01:04:12.166 --> 01:04:16.291
Oh. no. Before I let him come
between me and my heart's desire.

889
01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:18.041
I will kill <i>him.</i>

890
01:04:20.666 --> 01:04:24.083
It's always been this way.
People underestimating me.

891
01:04:24.166 --> 01:04:27.250
Friends. classmates.
my very own benefactor.

892
01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:28.750
- Thank you. Patsy.
- Everyone.

893
01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:30.416
Everyone…

894
01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:34.625
but my dear mother.

895
01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:40.333
And thank you for assisting earlier.

896
01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:43.250
It's unlike me to be caught by surprise.

897
01:04:43.333 --> 01:04:47.333
And you surprise too. Don't you. Landor?

898
01:04:48.458 --> 01:04:50.750
I have no desire to offend.

899
01:04:50.833 --> 01:04:54.750
but you're much more sophisticated
than you present.

900
01:04:55.541 --> 01:04:59.708
[chuckles] Now. tell me. is it true
you once solicited a confession

901
01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:02.250
with nothing more than a piercing look?

902
01:05:02.333 --> 01:05:04.333
[chuckles]

903
01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:11.333
With enough patience.

904
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:16.291
the suspect will often
interrogate himself.

905
01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:23.583
Well. you are most
delightful company. Landor.

906
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:28.666
I shall write a poem someday.

907
01:05:29.791 --> 01:05:33.208
Something that shall send
your name down through the ages.

908
01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:55.250
[Patsy] <i>Even after this attack.</i>
<i>you don't suspect Randy Ballinger?</i>

909
01:05:57.541 --> 01:05:59.125
So where does this leave you?

910
01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:01.375
Your investigation.

911
01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:05.458
I'm interested in Artemus Marquis.

912
01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:08.041
I take it you know him?

913
01:06:10.541 --> 01:06:11.708
Well. who doesn't?

914
01:06:13.791 --> 01:06:15.416
<i>Glorious look to him.</i>

915
01:06:16.875 --> 01:06:20.208
<i>He'd almost have</i>
<i>to die young. wouldn't he?</i>

916
01:06:22.958 --> 01:06:26.250
<i>But I wouldn't have</i>
<i>picked him for the violent sort.</i>

917
01:06:27.541 --> 01:06:29.541
<i>Always. um. very cool.</i>

918
01:06:32.041 --> 01:06:33.416
[Landor] <i>Perhaps he's not our man.</i>

919
01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:39.208
<i>There's a quality to him.</i>
<i>To his entire family.</i>

920
01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:42.125
<i>They act like people</i>
<i>who are guilty of something.</i>

921
01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:48.291
Aren't all families guilty of something?

922
01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:52.833
[knocking at door]

923
01:06:55.708 --> 01:06:58.166
- Captain.
- It's Mr. Ballinger.

924
01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:01.083
I'm afraid he's gone missing.

925
01:07:02.458 --> 01:07:04.666
[dramatic music playing]

926
01:07:07.375 --> 01:07:09.000
[indistinct chatter]

927
01:07:14.708 --> 01:07:16.291
[cadet 1] Next to those rocks.

928
01:07:17.708 --> 01:07:19.166
[cadet 2] Here on this side too.

929
01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:23.916
[cadet 3] Up the hill.

930
01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:28.125
[cadet 4] Cadet. right side.
Behind those trees.

931
01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:29.958
[cadet 5] Nothing here.

932
01:07:30.958 --> 01:07:32.958
[indistinct chatter continues]

933
01:07:41.416 --> 01:07:43.666
[Lee] Captain! Up here!

934
01:07:55.833 --> 01:07:56.833
[Hitchcock] My Lord.

935
01:08:19.541 --> 01:08:25.833
[Dr. Marquis] Mr. Ballinger's dissection
wasn't as clean as Fry's.

936
01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.708
Suggesting it was performed
by different hands.

937
01:08:31.958 --> 01:08:34.583
As for the castration…

938
01:08:36.791 --> 01:08:38.750
[hesitates] Well. I'm…

939
01:08:38.833 --> 01:08:39.875
[Thayer] Castration?

940
01:08:40.708 --> 01:08:42.208
My God. Landor.

941
01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:45.833
We're no closer to finding
who's responsible for this

942
01:08:45.916 --> 01:08:47.291
than we were a month ago!

943
01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:48.875
We are closer.

944
01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:51.208
- It's only a matter of time.
- Tell me!

945
01:08:52.916 --> 01:08:55.583
Have you found
more evidence of satanic practices?

946
01:08:57.250 --> 01:09:00.541
What of the so-called officer
who persuaded Private Cochrane

947
01:09:00.625 --> 01:09:02.291
to abandon Leroy Fry's body?

948
01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:04.625
Or Fry's diary?

949
01:09:04.708 --> 01:09:07.833
Have you found a single clue
that might be of use?

950
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:13.875
A maniac is freely roaming these hills.
disemboweling my men.

951
01:09:13.958 --> 01:09:18.416
Men who barely carry out their duties.
hardly leave their barracks or sleep.

952
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:21.250
And if they can sleep.
do so with their muskets!

953
01:09:21.833 --> 01:09:22.666
[scoffs]

954
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:29.666
I'm beginning to believe
you no longer think I'm competent

955
01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:31.916
to undertake this investigation.

956
01:09:33.166 --> 01:09:34.166
Thank you. doctor.

957
01:09:41.541 --> 01:09:45.208
It's not your competence we question.
it's your allegiance.

958
01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:50.166
Is there any possibility that this
could have been the work of Mr. Poe?

959
01:09:51.208 --> 01:09:52.041
Poe?

960
01:09:52.125 --> 01:09:54.791
Just yesterday.
he was regaling his table mates

961
01:09:54.875 --> 01:09:58.500
with an heroic account
of his epic tussle with Mr. Ballinger.

962
01:09:58.583 --> 01:10:02.083
declaring that he
fully intended to kill him

963
01:10:02.166 --> 01:10:04.500
should they ever cross swords again.

964
01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:06.208
You've seen Poe.

965
01:10:07.166 --> 01:10:11.291
Can you honestly tell me
he subdued Ballinger?

966
01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:15.083
No. there would have been no need.
Firearm would have turned the trick.

967
01:10:15.166 --> 01:10:17.583
Whatever his relations with Ballinger.

968
01:10:17.666 --> 01:10:21.958
there's no sign of any link
between Poe and Leroy Fry.

969
01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:25.125
- They didn't even know each other.
- [Thayer] Oh. but they did.

970
01:10:25.958 --> 01:10:28.791
They had a tussle
of their own last summer.

971
01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:33.958
I don't suppose he ever volunteered
that bit of information. did he?

972
01:10:34.041 --> 01:10:36.041
[pensive music building]

973
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.125
Then arrest him.

974
01:10:40.916 --> 01:10:43.958
Arrest him if you are so persuaded.

975
01:10:44.041 --> 01:10:45.958
All we have is motive.

976
01:10:46.583 --> 01:10:49.166
We're looking to you to supply evidence!

977
01:10:50.541 --> 01:10:54.958
Mr. Landor. do you harbor
a latent hostility toward this Academy?

978
01:10:55.541 --> 01:10:56.541
Is that it?

979
01:10:59.541 --> 01:11:05.208
I am risking my life
on behalf of your precious institution.

980
01:11:08.416 --> 01:11:09.250
But yes.

981
01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:16.875
I do believe that the Academy
takes away a young man's will.

982
01:11:17.458 --> 01:11:21.125
It fences him with regulations and rules.

983
01:11:22.541 --> 01:11:27.291
Deprives him of reason.
It makes him less human.

984
01:11:27.375 --> 01:11:32.125
Are you implying
the Academy is to blame for these deaths?

985
01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:36.500
Someone connected to the Academy. yes.
Hence. the Academy itself.

986
01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:38.000
[Hitchcock] Well. that's absurd.

987
01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:39.291
By your standard.

988
01:11:40.041 --> 01:11:44.000
every crime committed
by a Christian will be a stain on Christ.

989
01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.541
And so it is.

990
01:11:47.291 --> 01:11:49.791
[pensive music continues]

991
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
[music fades]

992
01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:07.583
When I first asked you… to take this job.

993
01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:16.166
you told me you never
had dealings with Leroy Fry. so. uh…

994
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:20.333
Let's start there. Well?

995
01:12:23.791 --> 01:12:26.541
- Well. that's not entirely true--
- Well… Well… Well…

996
01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:29.166
Why is nothing simple with you. Poe?

997
01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:31.666
Where are the facts?
Where are the simple facts?

998
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:34.083
Yes! Or no!

999
01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:36.625
The truth!

1000
01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:43.083
- Did you know Leroy Fry?
- Yes.

1001
01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:47.333
Did you have words with Leroy Fry?

1002
01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:50.208
Yes. Yes.

1003
01:12:55.125 --> 01:12:57.291
Did you kill Leroy Fry?

1004
01:12:59.958 --> 01:13:02.916
Did you kill Randolph Ballinger?

1005
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.833
[softly] No.

1006
01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.333
[exhales]

1007
01:13:10.083 --> 01:13:15.375
Did you have anything to do
with the desecrating of their bodies?

1008
01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:18.916
- No. no. no. May I be struck dead if I--
- But you do not deny

1009
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.791
that you threatened both men?

1010
01:13:21.875 --> 01:13:25.125
Well. as it relates
to Ballinger. that was…

1011
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:30.833
I never meant it.

1012
01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:35.750
- And Fry?
- I never once threatened him. I merely--

1013
01:13:35.833 --> 01:13:41.000
There is
a very disturbing pattern here. Poe.

1014
01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:46.791
Men who cross you
end up on the wrong end of a noose

1015
01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:51.958
with rather important organs
carved from their chests.

1016
01:13:52.791 --> 01:13:54.041
Mr. Landor…

1017
01:13:57.791 --> 01:13:59.958
[sighs deeply]
If I were to kill every cadet

1018
01:14:00.041 --> 01:14:02.958
who had abused me
during my brief tenure here.

1019
01:14:04.833 --> 01:14:08.041
I'm afraid you would find
the Corp of Cadets

1020
01:14:08.125 --> 01:14:09.791
reduced to less than a dozen.

1021
01:14:14.041 --> 01:14:17.250
Now. if you must know.
I've been a figure of fun

1022
01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:19.833
from my very first day here.

1023
01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:26.375
My manner. my age. my person…

1024
01:14:28.875 --> 01:14:30.291
my aesthetics.

1025
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:36.666
If I had a thousand lifetimes.

1026
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:39.166
I could not begin
to address all the injuries

1027
01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:40.583
that have been done to me.

1028
01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:48.250
Yes. I am guilty of a great.
great many things. but never that.

1029
01:14:50.916 --> 01:14:52.208
Never murder.

1030
01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:56.875
Now do you believe me?

1031
01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:06.166
I believe that you should take better care
of what you say and do.

1032
01:15:09.666 --> 01:15:14.416
For now. I can probably
hold off Hitchcock.

1033
01:15:15.833 --> 01:15:21.833
But if you ever lie to me again.

1034
01:15:21.916 --> 01:15:27.250
they can clap you in irons
and I won't lift a finger to help you.

1035
01:15:27.333 --> 01:15:30.458
Do you understand me?

1036
01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:43.333
Now if you'll excuse me.
I'm expected for dinner.

1037
01:15:50.583 --> 01:15:51.583
[exhales]

1038
01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:15.916
Thank you for joining us
in mourning Randolph's untimely passing.

1039
01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:19.541
The dear boy was family.

1040
01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:28.875
Don't you find my son
exceptionally handsome. Mr. Landor?

1041
01:16:32.458 --> 01:16:33.333
Um…

1042
01:16:34.708 --> 01:16:41.083
I would judge both of your children
to have been blessed in that regard.

1043
01:16:42.166 --> 01:16:44.583
[Julia] Yes. we are hereditarily blessed.

1044
01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:50.000
But I must say. I do find you a rarity.

1045
01:16:51.125 --> 01:16:54.458
A person of exceptional intelligence.

1046
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.291
The quality in such
ridiculously short supply here.

1047
01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:03.666
[Artemus] And with that intelligence.
Mr. Landor.

1048
01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.166
I hope when you're finished
with your official business.

1049
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:10.541
you will assist me
with a puzzle of my own.

1050
01:17:11.083 --> 01:17:13.916
- Oh. a puzzle?
- The strangest affair.

1051
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.958
While in recital. Monday.

1052
01:17:16.541 --> 01:17:20.416
it appears someone
had rifled through my belongings.

1053
01:17:21.541 --> 01:17:23.250
- [Landor] Oh.
- [Dr. Marquis] Well. eh…

1054
01:17:23.916 --> 01:17:27.125
- Terrible people are abroad.
- Really. Father?

1055
01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:30.416
I was inclining toward the theory
that the fellow was simply rude.

1056
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.166
while. of course.
having no idea who he was.

1057
01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:39.041
All the same.
you must be careful. Artemus.

1058
01:17:39.833 --> 01:17:41.625
- You really must.
- Oh. Mother.

1059
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.625
It was probably
just some tiresome old fellow

1060
01:17:45.708 --> 01:17:50.208
with nothing better to do
and no life of his own to speak of.

1061
01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:53.958
A rustic sort of cottager.

1062
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.416
Don't you think. Mr. Landor?

1063
01:17:58.625 --> 01:18:00.041
Oh.

1064
01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:02.125
- You have a cottage. don't you?
- Artemus.

1065
01:18:02.958 --> 01:18:06.208
You may even have some
very near relations who fit the pattern.

1066
01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:09.541
Perhaps a dear friend who likes
a tipple and to drink in a tavern.

1067
01:18:10.541 --> 01:18:13.083
Stop it! Just. please! I hate it!

1068
01:18:13.625 --> 01:18:16.000
I positively hate it
when you take on like this.

1069
01:18:16.083 --> 01:18:18.750
- I don't follow your drift. Mother.
- Oh. no. I'm sure you don't.

1070
01:18:18.833 --> 01:18:21.875
I might drift clear to the other side
of the Hudson and no one would care.

1071
01:18:21.958 --> 01:18:23.583
No one would follow!

1072
01:18:24.083 --> 01:18:26.458
- Would they. Daniel?
- [Dr. Marquis] Son. please.

1073
01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:30.041
[sobbing]

1074
01:18:35.041 --> 01:18:35.875
[door slams]

1075
01:18:36.416 --> 01:18:40.416
You'll… have to forgive my wife.

1076
01:18:42.375 --> 01:18:45.250
Mr. Ballinger's death

1077
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:50.291
has cast a pall
over our happy little clan.

1078
01:18:58.041 --> 01:19:02.458
I wonder if you'd care
to join me in my study. Mr. Landor?

1079
01:19:02.541 --> 01:19:03.541
I'd be delighted.

1080
01:19:11.875 --> 01:19:14.250
[Dr. Marquis] My apologies. constable.

1081
01:19:16.458 --> 01:19:20.791
Living on pins and needles
has taken its toll on all of us.

1082
01:19:20.875 --> 01:19:23.041
- No need to apologize.
- [chuckles softly] Yeah.

1083
01:19:23.833 --> 01:19:28.375
And the time of year.
all this confinement…

1084
01:19:28.458 --> 01:19:31.791
Mmm. It is all very understandable.

1085
01:19:36.333 --> 01:19:39.541
I couldn't help noticing. doctor.

1086
01:19:42.166 --> 01:19:44.208
Is your daughter unwell?

1087
01:19:45.833 --> 01:19:47.208
Quite observant.

1088
01:19:48.458 --> 01:19:49.458
Yes.

1089
01:19:51.166 --> 01:19:52.708
Yes. she's…

1090
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:57.791
She's had a rough go of it. that one.

1091
01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.541
Since she was a pup. really.

1092
01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:06.583
A ghastly illness
seizing her when no one is looking.

1093
01:20:06.666 --> 01:20:11.750
stopping her brain
and shaking her like a gourd.

1094
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:14.291
Beautiful child.

1095
01:20:15.458 --> 01:20:20.125
One marked for marriage. status. children.

1096
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:25.583
And in the same stroke. illness.

1097
01:20:25.666 --> 01:20:27.500
[piano playing faintly outside]

1098
01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:30.125
'Tis dreadful.

1099
01:20:31.458 --> 01:20:32.458
[door opens]

1100
01:20:33.416 --> 01:20:37.000
Gentlemen. Lea is in fine form
if you'd join us.

1101
01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:39.208
Thank you. son.

1102
01:20:42.541 --> 01:20:43.541
Shall we?

1103
01:20:44.333 --> 01:20:48.250
If you don't mind.
I'll just step out for some fresh air.

1104
01:20:48.333 --> 01:20:49.291
Of course.

1105
01:20:52.875 --> 01:20:54.375
[piano continues playing]

1106
01:20:55.291 --> 01:20:58.291
[Artemus] Father. have a game with me.

1107
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.166
[Dr. Marquis]
Shall I try the scholars again

1108
01:21:03.958 --> 01:21:07.000
or something more challenging this time?

1109
01:21:25.625 --> 01:21:27.625
[piano music continues]

1110
01:21:29.166 --> 01:21:31.125
[indistinct conversation]

1111
01:21:42.916 --> 01:21:44.916
[faint piano music continues]

1112
01:22:56.875 --> 01:22:58.875
[music ends]

1113
01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:08.166
- Just remarkable.
- Hardly.

1114
01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:10.208
Passable. maybe.

1115
01:23:10.875 --> 01:23:14.416
You don't realize the effect
your playing has on me.

1116
01:23:16.166 --> 01:23:18.166
On all of us. really. I…

1117
01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:23.208
- Yes?
- Well. I…

1118
01:23:26.583 --> 01:23:33.333
I don't quite know how else to put it.
but. um… I've come to realize

1119
01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:37.708
that I would do most anything for you.

1120
01:23:44.833 --> 01:23:45.958
Oh. Edgar.

1121
01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:52.125
[suspenseful music playing]

1122
01:24:10.458 --> 01:24:13.500
[Julia] May I help you
find something. Mr. Landor?

1123
01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:17.500
You've recovered. And so soon.

1124
01:24:18.458 --> 01:24:19.791
Well. do forgive me.

1125
01:24:19.875 --> 01:24:23.791
I feared I was coming down with
one of those horrid migraines.

1126
01:24:23.875 --> 01:24:28.333
but it seems a moment's rest
was all I required.

1127
01:24:28.416 --> 01:24:31.375
And I feel quite cured. Mmm.

1128
01:24:34.833 --> 01:24:37.708
Let's put that dreadful.
old thing away. shall we?

1129
01:24:37.791 --> 01:24:40.125
I'm quite sure it won't fit you.

1130
01:24:42.208 --> 01:24:44.333
The good doctor and I
were in search of it.

1131
01:24:45.125 --> 01:24:46.208
And I found it.

1132
01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:52.083
[Julia] Look what the constable
found in our closet. darling.

1133
01:24:52.666 --> 01:24:58.083
Remember Artemus wearing it
as a young lad around the house?

1134
01:24:58.916 --> 01:25:00.208
Remember. love?

1135
01:25:00.291 --> 01:25:02.500
- I remember. Mother.
- It's my brother's coat.

1136
01:25:02.583 --> 01:25:03.833
Your brother's?

1137
01:25:03.916 --> 01:25:06.500
That's the only thing
we have to remember him by.

1138
01:25:07.166 --> 01:25:08.791
- [knocking on door]
- Why do you have it?

1139
01:25:08.875 --> 01:25:10.500
Perhaps Artemus can answer that.

1140
01:25:11.083 --> 01:25:14.833
[door opens and closes]

1141
01:25:17.416 --> 01:25:19.041
[Eugenia] Everyone is in the salon.

1142
01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:22.916
[Dr. Marquis] Ethan.

1143
01:25:24.916 --> 01:25:26.166
What brings you here?

1144
01:25:27.583 --> 01:25:28.875
Another cadet is missing.

1145
01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:35.250
And I've formed a search party
ready to go within the hour.

1146
01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:37.458
No stone will be left unturned.

1147
01:25:37.541 --> 01:25:39.583
[Thayer] God help us. I shudder to think--

1148
01:25:39.666 --> 01:25:40.500
[Landor] Gentlemen!

1149
01:25:40.583 --> 01:25:43.375
I've just been to Mr. Stoddard's quarters.

1150
01:25:43.458 --> 01:25:48.166
His trunk was empty. No civilian clothes
were to be found anywhere.

1151
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:50.375
I believe he has run off.

1152
01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:52.500
Run off?

1153
01:25:52.583 --> 01:25:54.750
Fry's diary allows

1154
01:25:54.833 --> 01:25:58.791
that both Stoddard and Ballinger
were good mates with Leroy Fry.

1155
01:25:58.875 --> 01:26:00.958
Fearing he might be next. I think he ran.

1156
01:26:01.041 --> 01:26:04.708
Well. that may well be. but what about
Artemus and the officer's coat?

1157
01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:08.250
If he's involved. how can
we possibly delay arresting him?

1158
01:26:08.333 --> 01:26:13.208
He is… too cool a customer for that.
All he has to do is deny it.

1159
01:26:14.041 --> 01:26:17.291
Now. there's a last avenue
of inquiry I'm exploring.

1160
01:26:17.791 --> 01:26:19.750
Two of his closest companions are dead.

1161
01:26:19.833 --> 01:26:23.083
and imminently. I must report
to the president that we have our man.

1162
01:26:24.791 --> 01:26:27.333
We have our man. Landor. Do we not?

1163
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.708
[dramatic music playing]

1164
01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:45.833
[Eugenia] <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

1165
01:26:47.666 --> 01:26:48.666
Edgar.

1166
01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:54.958
- [Poe] I. uh…
- [Landor] <i>Professor?</i>

1167
01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Pépé?

1168
01:27:01.333 --> 01:27:05.875
Last time I was here.
you mentioned a witch hunter and a book.

1169
01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:08.791
Yes. <i>Discours du Diable.</i>

1170
01:27:08.875 --> 01:27:10.791
Henri Le Clerc.

1171
01:27:11.333 --> 01:27:13.166
Was Le Clerc a priest?

1172
01:27:14.041 --> 01:27:15.416
One burned at the stake.

1173
01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:21.208
[Poe] <i>It came to me while I slept</i>

1174
01:27:23.791 --> 01:27:25.791
<i>Down. down. down</i>

1175
01:27:26.791 --> 01:27:30.000
<i>Came the hot threshing flurry</i>

1176
01:27:32.333 --> 01:27:34.791
<i>Ill at heart. I beseeched her to hurry</i>

1177
01:27:36.791 --> 01:27:37.958
<i>"Lenore"</i>

1178
01:27:40.166 --> 01:27:42.375
<i>She forbore the reply</i>

1179
01:27:44.041 --> 01:27:46.416
<i>Endless night</i>
<i>Caught her then in its slurry</i>

1180
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.666
<i>Shrouding all. but her pale blue eye</i>

1181
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:51.833
<i>Darkest night. black with hell</i>

1182
01:27:51.916 --> 01:27:53.500
<i>Charneled fury</i>

1183
01:27:55.375 --> 01:27:56.708
<i>Leaving only</i>

1184
01:27:58.041 --> 01:27:59.458
<i>That deathly blue eye</i>

1185
01:28:06.416 --> 01:28:07.416
Do you see?

1186
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:11.291
Lenore.

1187
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:13.833
Lea.

1188
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:18.625
It speaks of your unspeakable distress.

1189
01:28:20.166 --> 01:28:24.166
A conclusion to what's… oppressing you.

1190
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:25.666
The poem…

1191
01:28:28.958 --> 01:28:30.541
is speaking to us.

1192
01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:44.500
Remember when you said
you'd do anything for me?

1193
01:28:47.458 --> 01:28:48.791
Your devil worshipper.

1194
01:28:54.416 --> 01:28:56.250
- Thank you. Pépé.
- Yeah.

1195
01:29:03.041 --> 01:29:04.916
[footsteps approaching]

1196
01:29:09.541 --> 01:29:10.583
Mr. Landor.

1197
01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.583
Your family.

1198
01:29:16.791 --> 01:29:20.333
Your family… have been

1199
01:29:21.833 --> 01:29:22.833
quite a puzzle.

1200
01:29:24.041 --> 01:29:29.041
I could never get a fix
of who was in command.

1201
01:29:29.833 --> 01:29:32.625
One time or other I suspected each of you.

1202
01:29:32.708 --> 01:29:34.750
It never occurred to me

1203
01:29:36.583 --> 01:29:40.250
that it might be someone
who wasn't even alive.

1204
01:29:41.875 --> 01:29:42.958
[voice shaking] Pardon me?

1205
01:29:43.041 --> 01:29:46.875
Father Henri Le Clerc.

1206
01:29:47.666 --> 01:29:51.500
Finest of witch hunters.

1207
01:29:52.333 --> 01:29:55.083
until he became the hunted.

1208
01:29:56.458 --> 01:29:58.250
What are you talking about?

1209
01:29:59.166 --> 01:30:04.250
Your daughter. she suffers
from a falling sickness. does she not?

1210
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:08.291
She copes because
she is in contact with someone.

1211
01:30:08.375 --> 01:30:10.791
Someone who instructs her.

1212
01:30:13.041 --> 01:30:14.041
Him.

1213
01:30:14.916 --> 01:30:19.375
Do not make me question
your sanity. Mr. Landor.

1214
01:30:19.458 --> 01:30:21.666
Uh. what are you suggesting?

1215
01:30:27.041 --> 01:30:33.833
Le Clerc's incredibly rare
<i>Discours du Diable.</i>

1216
01:30:37.916 --> 01:30:42.500
Well. communicating with the devil

1217
01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:47.083
is not a pastime
with which I am familiar. Mr. Landor.

1218
01:30:47.625 --> 01:30:50.958
[hesitating]
I have never read a page of this book.

1219
01:30:51.041 --> 01:30:55.541
Does your daughter speak with the dead?!

1220
01:30:59.083 --> 01:31:01.083
[somber music playing]

1221
01:31:12.083 --> 01:31:16.000
Over the years. the seizures
have gotten much. much worse.

1222
01:31:17.583 --> 01:31:18.416
I…

1223
01:31:19.125 --> 01:31:25.083
I have tried
every medical regimen I could think of.

1224
01:31:25.958 --> 01:31:28.833
She was given three months to live.

1225
01:31:29.583 --> 01:31:32.125
Do you know
what it feels like to go to sleep.

1226
01:31:32.208 --> 01:31:35.208
not knowing if your daughter
will make it through the night?

1227
01:31:36.083 --> 01:31:39.625
But then. one day she came to me.

1228
01:31:41.041 --> 01:31:44.583
and said that she'd met someone.

1229
01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.875
Her great-great-grandfather.

1230
01:31:47.541 --> 01:31:48.416
Le Clerc?

1231
01:31:49.333 --> 01:31:51.041
Henri Le Clerc wasn't evil.

1232
01:31:53.291 --> 01:31:55.333
He… He was misunderstood.

1233
01:31:56.041 --> 01:31:57.375
[whispering indistinctly]

1234
01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.791
[Lea breathing deeply]

1235
01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:29.583
[speaking Latin]

1236
01:32:48.583 --> 01:32:52.916
They swore to me Mr. Fry was already dead.

1237
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.083
They swore they could never kill anyone.

1238
01:32:55.166 --> 01:32:57.125
You believed them.

1239
01:32:57.208 --> 01:32:58.791
I had no choice.

1240
01:32:58.875 --> 01:33:01.791
You are a physician! A man of science!

1241
01:33:01.875 --> 01:33:05.125
How dare you
put your faith in such madness?

1242
01:33:05.208 --> 01:33:06.041
Because…

1243
01:33:07.083 --> 01:33:11.000
Because I… I… I couldn't save her myself.

1244
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:14.208
My own art had failed me.

1245
01:33:16.458 --> 01:33:19.500
I sacrificed everything for my Lea.

1246
01:33:20.125 --> 01:33:23.250
So how can I then object
to her finding a cure elsewhere?

1247
01:33:23.333 --> 01:33:24.291
Doctor.

1248
01:33:25.916 --> 01:33:27.750
Communicating with the dead…

1249
01:33:29.958 --> 01:33:32.333
that's not normal. But murder…

1250
01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:36.333
destroying innocent lives…

1251
01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:40.750
that's inhuman.

1252
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.375
Someone has to hang for this.

1253
01:33:46.458 --> 01:33:47.750
[coughing]

1254
01:33:48.541 --> 01:33:54.083
[hesitating]
I only indulged her because… miraculously.

1255
01:33:55.333 --> 01:33:57.041
she seemed to improve.

1256
01:33:58.250 --> 01:34:00.666
Doctor. where is your family?

1257
01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:03.875
Where are your children?

1258
01:34:05.083 --> 01:34:07.333
Mr. Poe was here earlier.

1259
01:34:08.958 --> 01:34:12.291
He left with… With Artemus.

1260
01:34:13.125 --> 01:34:15.875
Why is his cloak still in the hall?

1261
01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:18.791
Doctor. where is Lea?

1262
01:34:20.625 --> 01:34:22.625
Doctor. where is your family?

1263
01:34:22.708 --> 01:34:26.291
[dramatic musical flourish]

1264
01:34:28.541 --> 01:34:31.125
- [Lea breathing deeply]
- [Artemus] It's starting to wear off.

1265
01:34:32.375 --> 01:34:33.333
[Julia] Lea.

1266
01:34:36.833 --> 01:34:38.041
Continue.

1267
01:34:40.125 --> 01:34:42.125
[Julia speaking Latin]

1268
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:44.708
[unsettling music playing]

1269
01:34:44.791 --> 01:34:46.375
[continues speaking Latin]

1270
01:35:00.958 --> 01:35:01.791
[Poe groans]

1271
01:35:05.250 --> 01:35:06.250
{\an8}[Poe] What's happening?

1272
01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:09.500
[Poe groans]

1273
01:35:09.583 --> 01:35:11.000
It won't be much longer.

1274
01:35:11.083 --> 01:35:14.208
I don't feel terribly well.

1275
01:35:16.875 --> 01:35:19.875
- I thought…
- No. [shushing]

1276
01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:25.625
Just a few minutes more and I'll be free.

1277
01:35:29.375 --> 01:35:30.541
Free?

1278
01:35:30.625 --> 01:35:31.625
Yes.

1279
01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:35.500
Please. Lea. I'm…

1280
01:35:37.708 --> 01:35:39.041
This must happen.

1281
01:35:40.666 --> 01:35:41.916
You do understand.

1282
01:35:42.833 --> 01:35:46.375
Sacrifice is
the ultimate expression of love.

1283
01:35:47.583 --> 01:35:51.833
I knew from the moment I met you.
you were the one.

1284
01:35:53.791 --> 01:35:54.791
Lea.

1285
01:35:55.333 --> 01:35:57.791
- Yes?
- I do love you.

1286
01:36:12.458 --> 01:36:14.000
[Lea and Julia speaking Latin]

1287
01:36:27.166 --> 01:36:28.666
Artemus…

1288
01:36:30.625 --> 01:36:31.791
[Landor] Enough!

1289
01:36:32.458 --> 01:36:33.416
[Lea whimpers]

1290
01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.750
[dramatic music playing]

1291
01:36:37.583 --> 01:36:39.541
- Get out!
- You'll hang for this!

1292
01:36:39.625 --> 01:36:41.708
- [Artemus] You've no business here!
- Lea. finish!

1293
01:36:41.791 --> 01:36:44.750
Mrs. Marquis. do you
wish to see your children hang?

1294
01:36:44.833 --> 01:36:47.208
- Don't listen. He's bluffing!
- Continue.

1295
01:36:47.291 --> 01:36:49.750
- Lea!
- That's Fry's heart. no?

1296
01:36:49.833 --> 01:36:51.708
- Landor.
- [Julia] Lea. continue!

1297
01:36:51.791 --> 01:36:54.791
Ballinger. he'd do anything for you.
even murder a man.

1298
01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.333
And. Artemus. you killed him.

1299
01:36:56.416 --> 01:36:58.666
Please. just leave us alone.
It's almost done.

1300
01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:00.958
- Lea. finish!
- Lea. it is done!

1301
01:37:01.791 --> 01:37:02.791
It was you.

1302
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:06.375
It was you who lured Fry out with a note--

1303
01:37:06.458 --> 01:37:08.083
It wasn't her idea! It was mine!

1304
01:37:08.166 --> 01:37:09.791
- I did it!
- No! Artemus!

1305
01:37:09.875 --> 01:37:11.333

[bell tolling in distance]

[footsteps approaching]

1339
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.291
I'm told he's lost no more blood
than a physician would have drawn

1340
01:39:43.375 --> 01:39:45.125
in the course of a normal bleeding.

1341
01:39:46.291 --> 01:39:48.250
Might have been the best thing for him.

1342
01:39:51.625 --> 01:39:54.166
More to life than meets the eye.
Landor. I admit.

1343
01:39:55.333 --> 01:39:56.625
I couldn't agree more.

1344
01:39:58.083 --> 01:40:01.000
So what now of Mrs. Marquis?

1345
01:40:02.083 --> 01:40:04.791
Grieving as only a mother can.

1346
01:40:05.708 --> 01:40:08.041
The magistrate felt she'd suffered enough.

1347
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.500
But you'll be pleased to know

1348
01:40:11.583 --> 01:40:15.333
our good doctor
has submitted his resignation.

1349
01:40:16.958 --> 01:40:21.541
None of this pleases me. I can assure you.

1350
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:25.750
Landor.

1351
01:40:33.208 --> 01:40:38.375
You and I could not be more dissimilar
in manner. philosophy.

1352
01:40:41.458 --> 01:40:43.208
But I wish to convey

1353
01:40:43.291 --> 01:40:46.416
that if this business
has ever rendered me…

1354
01:40:49.375 --> 01:40:54.750
Which is to say. if ever out
of impertinence. I have impugned…

1355
01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:58.375
your competence…

1356
01:41:00.916 --> 01:41:02.000
then I'm sorry.

1357
01:41:05.166 --> 01:41:06.208
Thank you. captain.

1358
01:41:17.333 --> 01:41:21.125
How could I have dined and fraternized
with the man all of these years?

1359
01:41:22.166 --> 01:41:24.625
Known his family almost as well as my own

1360
01:41:24.708 --> 01:41:27.125
and never fathomed
the depths of their distress.

1361
01:41:28.125 --> 01:41:29.791
By design. colonel.

1362
01:41:31.208 --> 01:41:32.041
Yes.

1363
01:41:33.458 --> 01:41:36.833
Yes. I suppose shame on me.

1364
01:41:39.125 --> 01:41:42.500
I can only assume
Artemus murdered Mr. Ballinger

1365
01:41:42.583 --> 01:41:44.875
to prevent him
from alerting the authorities.

1366
01:41:44.958 --> 01:41:48.916
and Mr. Stoddard ran
rather than become the next victim.

1367
01:41:49.625 --> 01:41:51.125
[Landor] You can assume that. yes.

1368
01:41:53.250 --> 01:41:54.666
Well. Landor.

1369
01:41:57.416 --> 01:42:01.041
I declare your contractual duties
fulfilled to the letter.

1370
01:42:01.875 --> 01:42:04.083
I hereby release you from your contract.

1371
01:42:05.666 --> 01:42:07.375
I hope that won't displease you.

1372
01:42:07.458 --> 01:42:11.625
At the very least. I hope
you won't object to accepting our thanks.

1373
01:42:14.666 --> 01:42:20.375
The jackals in Washington
will soon be in retreat. I hope.

1374
01:42:21.125 --> 01:42:24.125
I believe we have won a stay of execution.

1375
01:42:24.791 --> 01:42:26.750
No. Colonel.

1376
01:42:29.833 --> 01:42:31.833
[pensive music playing]

1377
01:42:59.916 --> 01:43:01.833
Don't you look fully recovered.

1378
01:43:10.083 --> 01:43:11.458
I know about your daughter.

1379
01:43:15.916 --> 01:43:17.250
[sighs] Very well.

1380
01:43:18.916 --> 01:43:21.500
What does Mattie have to do with anything?

1381
01:43:21.583 --> 01:43:22.541
Everything.

1382
01:43:23.875 --> 01:43:25.333
As you know full well.

1383
01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.000
It came to me while I slept.

1384
01:44:03.708 --> 01:44:05.708
[somber music playing]

1385
01:44:07.458 --> 01:44:08.875
[gasps]

1386
01:44:16.625 --> 01:44:20.750
The note… found in Leroy Fry's hand.

1387
01:44:21.375 --> 01:44:25.166
The note left for him
luring the poor bloke from his barracks.

1388
01:44:27.208 --> 01:44:29.541
You were careless enough
to leave that with me.

1389
01:44:38.791 --> 01:44:41.041
This is the other note you left.

1390
01:44:43.666 --> 01:44:44.791
<i>Remember?</i>

1391
01:44:49.166 --> 01:44:50.166
<i>I'm most</i>

1392
01:44:51.541 --> 01:44:53.750
struck by the shape of your characters.

1393
01:44:54.708 --> 01:44:58.125
Uppercase. as you well know.
are every bit as damning as lowercase.

1394
01:44:58.208 --> 01:45:01.125
The A. the R. the G and the E.

1395
01:45:01.208 --> 01:45:05.708
virtually identical to the ones
found in Leroy Fry's note.

1396
01:45:07.416 --> 01:45:11.625
You can imagine my astonishment.

1397
01:45:13.833 --> 01:45:17.416
Could the same man
have written both notes?

1398
01:45:18.875 --> 01:45:23.791
And why would Landor have
any reason to correspond with Leroy Fry?

1399
01:45:26.416 --> 01:45:30.875
As luck would have it.
I ran into <i>la</i> divine Patsy.

1400
01:45:34.625 --> 01:45:36.041
His daughter Mattie…

1401
01:45:36.125 --> 01:45:37.833
[Poe]<i> She told me the whole story.</i>

1402
01:45:39.291 --> 01:45:41.833
<i>Returning home from the Academy Ball…</i>

1403
01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:44.166
- [man 1] Grab her!
- [Mathilde screaming]

1404
01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:45.458
- [man 2] Hold her.
- No!

1405
01:45:45.541 --> 01:45:47.041
[Poe] <i>…your Mattie was raped…</i>

1406
01:45:47.583 --> 01:45:48.833
[Mathilde] No!

1407
01:45:48.916 --> 01:45:51.500
<i>…and left for dead</i>
<i>by three nameless ruffians.</i>

1408
01:45:51.583 --> 01:45:52.500
[man 1] Quiet.

1409
01:45:53.375 --> 01:45:55.958
- Please. no! No!
- [man 1] Julius. grab her legs!

1410
01:45:56.041 --> 01:45:58.416
- No! No. no. no!
- Grab her!

1411
01:45:59.583 --> 01:46:01.708
- Legs! Legs! Hold her down!
- No!

1412
01:46:01.791 --> 01:46:03.583
- Keep her still.
- Please!

1413
01:46:03.666 --> 01:46:05.333
[Poe] <i>A bad bunch. indeed.</i>

1414
01:46:05.416 --> 01:46:06.250
[Landor] Mattie.

1415
01:46:06.791 --> 01:46:08.375
[Poe] <i>Just as Leroy Fry had said.</i>

1416
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:11.250
Mattie?

1417
01:46:12.250 --> 01:46:14.333
Oh. God! Mattie.

1418
01:46:14.416 --> 01:46:16.500
- Oh. my God! Come here.
- [crying]

1419
01:46:20.666 --> 01:46:22.375
Mattie. [crying]

1420
01:46:23.458 --> 01:46:24.916
[Mathilde] I'm sorry.

1421
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.375
[sobbing]

1422
01:46:27.458 --> 01:46:29.041
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1423
01:46:29.791 --> 01:46:32.625
Everything will be all right.

1424
01:46:35.125 --> 01:46:36.125
It'll all turn out.

1425
01:46:36.958 --> 01:46:38.958
[somber music playing]

1426
01:47:05.666 --> 01:47:07.375
[Mathilde whispering indistinctly]

1427
01:47:11.708 --> 01:47:13.916
Mattie. he cannot help you.

1428
01:47:15.625 --> 01:47:18.041
- Please. my love. Let me help you.
- [sniffles]

1429
01:47:20.916 --> 01:47:22.333
[panting]

1430
01:47:25.125 --> 01:47:29.250
[Poe] But she didn't run away. did she?

1431
01:47:43.416 --> 01:47:44.291
[Landor] Mattie?

1432
01:47:49.708 --> 01:47:50.541
Mattie.

1433
01:47:57.541 --> 01:47:58.541
Mattie.

1434
01:48:06.833 --> 01:48:09.416
Mattie. please. Come here.

1435
01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:16.250
Please. my love. Come here.
Please come here.

1436
01:48:16.916 --> 01:48:18.041
Don't.

1437
01:48:18.125 --> 01:48:19.791
Everything will be all right.

1438
01:48:21.583 --> 01:48:23.375
[voice breaking] Please. Mattie.
Come back.

1439
01:48:24.666 --> 01:48:25.916
It'll all turn out.

1440
01:48:29.375 --> 01:48:30.208
Don't.

1441
01:48:31.541 --> 01:48:32.541
I love you.

1442
01:48:33.083 --> 01:48:35.000
[music swells]

1443
01:48:46.666 --> 01:48:48.666
[music fades]

1444
01:48:55.041 --> 01:48:56.458
Why did you never tell me?

1445
01:48:58.250 --> 01:48:59.375
It's not a story

1446
01:49:01.250 --> 01:49:02.291
I enjoy telling.

1447
01:49:06.041 --> 01:49:07.666
But I would have comforted you.

1448
01:49:09.666 --> 01:49:12.916
Helped you as you helped me.

1449
01:49:16.208 --> 01:49:17.041
[sniffles]

1450
01:49:17.875 --> 01:49:22.958
I don't think I can
be comforted on that particular subject.

1451
01:49:29.416 --> 01:49:32.375
So what did I do next?

1452
01:49:34.125 --> 01:49:37.291
Exactly what you would have done.

1453
01:49:37.375 --> 01:49:40.541
Examined all assumptions. beginning with

1454
01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:44.083
what were the chances that two parties

1455
01:49:44.166 --> 01:49:48.750
would have had designs
on the same cadet in the same evening?

1456
01:49:48.833 --> 01:49:49.708
Small!

1457
01:49:50.791 --> 01:49:52.041
Small indeed!

1458
01:49:53.916 --> 01:49:58.958
Unless we see one party
as being contingent upon the other.

1459
01:49:59.041 --> 01:50:02.041
or what if one party say. Artemus and Lea.

1460
01:50:02.125 --> 01:50:05.875
what if they were simply
on the lookout for a dead body.

1461
01:50:05.958 --> 01:50:08.125
And then the opportunity
magically appears.

1462
01:50:08.208 --> 01:50:11.958
and they don't care who the body is.
provided it had a heart.

1463
01:50:12.041 --> 01:50:15.208
The one thing
they won't do for it is kill.

1464
01:50:15.291 --> 01:50:19.416
No. it is the other party
who is ready and willing to kill.

1465
01:50:21.458 --> 01:50:23.708
And to kill this man in particular.

1466
01:50:23.791 --> 01:50:25.333
Why? Why?

1467
01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:35.166
Might it be revenge. Landor?

1468
01:50:42.166 --> 01:50:44.166
[distant animal calls]

1469
01:50:50.583 --> 01:50:53.416
Patsy? Patsy?

1470
01:50:54.083 --> 01:50:55.750
- [Landor grunts]
- [Fry struggling]

1471
01:50:58.458 --> 01:50:59.291
[screaming]

1472
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:02.083
[Landor grunts]

1473
01:51:06.083 --> 01:51:07.583
- [Fry] Help!
- Who was with you?

1474
01:51:14.958 --> 01:51:16.916
[struggling. choking]

1475
01:51:28.708 --> 01:51:29.541
[choking stops]

1476
01:51:30.958 --> 01:51:32.666
[rustling]

1477
01:51:34.250 --> 01:51:35.291
[Huntoon] Someone there?

1478
01:51:41.333 --> 01:51:42.166
Hello?

1479
01:51:55.916 --> 01:51:57.000
[shudders]

1480
01:52:08.916 --> 01:52:13.166
[Poe] <i>So… the second party is interrupted.</i>

1481
01:52:14.916 --> 01:52:17.541
<i>though not before</i>
<i>his successful resolution.</i>

1482
01:52:19.458 --> 01:52:22.125
<i>Steals back to his cottage</i>
<i>in Buttermilk Falls.</i>

1483
01:52:23.708 --> 01:52:25.291
where he has escaped unnoticed.

1484
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:31.291
But he's shocked at being summoned back
to West Point the very next day

1485
01:52:32.583 --> 01:52:35.333
to learn that in the intervening hours.

1486
01:52:35.416 --> 01:52:38.916
the dead man's body
has been most horribly mutilated.

1487
01:52:39.625 --> 01:52:43.541
Thus providing his crimes
with an extraordinary cover.

1488
01:52:43.625 --> 01:52:44.458
Hmm.

1489
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:48.833
He must think God himself was on his side.

1490
01:52:50.291 --> 01:52:54.833
Being engaged to solve
the very crimes that he himself committed.

1491
01:52:57.208 --> 01:53:03.166
And as a result. Artemus and Lea
will forever go down as murderers.

1492
01:53:03.250 --> 01:53:06.416
Ah… There's no forever about it.

1493
01:53:07.208 --> 01:53:10.916
They will be forgotten
just like the rest of us.

1494
01:53:11.541 --> 01:53:14.041
I shall not forget them!

1495
01:53:16.166 --> 01:53:17.875
Especially my Lea.

1496
01:53:20.541 --> 01:53:23.625
She was to be a wife. Landor. a mother.

1497
01:53:27.875 --> 01:53:31.166
Nor shall I forget how you
played the rest of us as fools.

1498
01:53:32.791 --> 01:53:33.791
Fools.

1499
01:53:37.583 --> 01:53:39.291
But I was your prize fool.

1500
01:53:41.291 --> 01:53:43.291
- Was I not?
- No.

1501
01:53:49.458 --> 01:53:53.333
You were the one who I was
to deliver myself to all along.

1502
01:53:53.416 --> 01:53:57.625
I knew that from the moment
I first met you. and here we are.

1503
01:54:01.875 --> 01:54:02.875
[Landor sniffles]

1504
01:54:03.791 --> 01:54:04.958
I. uh…

1505
01:54:06.250 --> 01:54:07.208
[sighs]

1506
01:54:08.625 --> 01:54:11.166
If you want me to say I'm sorry. I will.

1507
01:54:13.083 --> 01:54:14.583
I don't want your apologies.

1508
01:54:16.541 --> 01:54:19.291
No. I want answers.

1509
01:54:21.416 --> 01:54:24.291
How did you know
it was Fry who raped Mattie?

1510
01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:35.416
The sheep and the cows. your doing?

1511
01:54:36.708 --> 01:54:39.041
- Of course.
- And Ballinger?

1512
01:54:39.541 --> 01:54:40.708
Mmm-hmm.

1513
01:54:43.333 --> 01:54:44.958
[sighs deeply] Ballinger.

1514
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:47.333
I had to cut his heart out.

1515
01:54:48.541 --> 01:54:50.875
Had to make it look
like the work of satanists.

1516
01:54:50.958 --> 01:54:53.333
That is no easy job for an old man.

1517
01:54:55.125 --> 01:54:57.791
How did you learn
of Ballinger's involvement?

1518
01:55:01.041 --> 01:55:02.041
Fry's diary.

1519
01:55:05.166 --> 01:55:07.083
Did Ballinger confess as well?

1520
01:55:07.166 --> 01:55:10.500
- Oh. yes. under duress.
- [Ballinger] <i>No. please!</i>

1521
01:55:10.583 --> 01:55:12.000
- [thunder rumbling]
- [Ballinger grunts]

1522
01:55:12.083 --> 01:55:14.333
Who else was with you?!

1523
01:55:14.416 --> 01:55:15.625
Julius Stoddard.

1524
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:18.833
Julius.

1525
01:55:21.041 --> 01:55:21.958
Sorry.

1526
01:55:22.041 --> 01:55:24.250
[Ballinger grunting. coughing]

1527
01:55:24.333 --> 01:55:25.333
They both…

1528
01:55:28.458 --> 01:55:30.250
They both recalled her name.

1529
01:55:31.541 --> 01:55:35.958
and I made certain
that he recalled what she was wearing.

1530
01:55:36.791 --> 01:55:39.250
Every detail of her dress.

1531
01:55:39.958 --> 01:55:43.458
Only Stoddard. it seems.
has escaped your justice.

1532
01:55:44.083 --> 01:55:50.541
I haven't… the strength
or the will to chase him down.

1533
01:55:50.625 --> 01:55:51.750
I only hope…

1534
01:55:54.833 --> 01:56:00.583
that he spends the rest of his…
miserable life looking over his shoulder.

1535
01:56:02.250 --> 01:56:08.333
What they did
was an appalling. savage thing.

1536
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:13.333
But you might have gone straight
to Thayer. secured a confession.

1537
01:56:13.416 --> 01:56:15.125
I didn't want them to confess.

1538
01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:21.250
I wanted them to die.

1539
01:56:31.916 --> 01:56:33.041
And so what now?

1540
01:56:35.791 --> 01:56:36.666
What now?

1541
01:56:38.333 --> 01:56:39.583
That depends on you.

1542
01:56:49.666 --> 01:56:51.750
I have a pair of notes…

1543
01:56:54.041 --> 01:56:55.958
that will send you to the gallows.

1544
01:57:19.041 --> 01:57:20.083
Very well.

1545
01:57:33.791 --> 01:57:35.791
[Poe sighs softly]

1546
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:21.625
You know. Edgar. I often wish

1547
01:58:22.916 --> 01:58:25.916
that my Mattie had run into you

1548
01:58:27.583 --> 01:58:31.250
that night… of the ball.

1549
01:58:34.041 --> 01:58:35.041
Who knows?

1550
01:58:42.708 --> 01:58:44.583
We might have become a family indeed.

1551
01:58:51.375 --> 01:58:52.250
[inhales sharply]

1552
01:58:52.333 --> 01:58:53.750
I sure treasure…

1553
01:58:58.958 --> 01:59:01.458
[breathes shakily]
