00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.884
VO: Here we stand.
on the shoulders of giants.

4
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.730
These are our words

5
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.984
and our sacred charge.

6
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.594
Greatness is the foundation of our world.

7
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.704
Greatness let us survive
centuries of strife.

8
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.814
Tame the world to our will.

9
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.284
and spread across the stars
at the speed of light.

10
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.730
That same greatness may be in you.

11
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.850
Now it's time to find out.

12
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.640
Your Academies have nominated you

13
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.884
for your ambition.

14
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.434
your drive. your potential for greatness.

15
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.734
It's time to prove yourself worthy

16
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.800
in the Sol Invictus games...

17
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.784
You and your team will
be cast across the stars

18
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.284
to a pre-selected planet.

19
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.134
Your mission is a race against time

20
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.534
and a triumph of will.

21
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.534
You are to set up camp

22
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.770
establish a foothold for your Academy

23
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.154
and use all the tools at your disposal.

24
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.084
You are to search the sky and pinpoint

25
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.084
out of all the stars in the sky

26
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.400
which is Earth's sun: Sol.

27
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.284
But be warned: only one team can win

28
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.134
and each Academy has sent their best

29
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.934
and brightest to compete against you.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.260
Your team Captain will lead you.

31
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.484
Your Astronomer will search the skies.

32
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.770
And your team must form a cohesive unit

33
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.214
to have any hope of victory.

34
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.334
We're strong together. broken apart.

35
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.534
Eternal glory awaits the winner.

36
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.794
Use all the tools and wits you have

37
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.684
to prove your greatness.

38
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.534
But move quickly.

39
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.784
Only the victorious team may return home.

40
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.684
The cosmos are dark and dangerous.

41
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.450
There's no room for mediocrity.

42
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.084
Return a champion or not at all.

43
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.734
Winning is the only rule.

44
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.684
VO: Welcome to Sol Invictus...

45
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.434
We have to turn it off!

46
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.084
What about the rest of them?

47
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.080
They haven't made it out yet!

48
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.420
Leave 'em! The Slip Gate's gonna collapse!

49
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.100
I can fix this!

50
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.034
Take this!

51
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.864
They're still inside!

52
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.020
Look out!

53
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.984
That's all I can do!

54
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.734
Clear out! Run!

55
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.384
Okay listen up.

56
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.134
Something must have happened to the gate.

57
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.134
The rest of our teams haven't come through.

58
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.200
Am I the only Team Captain?

59
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.650
Eli?

60
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.910
What are you doing here?

61
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.844
I came out.

62
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.584
With Virgo Academy.

63
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.680
Is anyone here a Team Engineer?

64
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.274
What's your name?

65
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.104
Ira. From Aries Academy.

66
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.170
Come with me.

67
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.644
The rest of my team.
they hadn't come through yet!

68
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.044
My brother was with them.

69
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.044
Mine too. Listen to me. Ira.

70
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.738
Can you get the rest of my team through?

71
00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:50.754
I don't know.
I've never worked a Slip Gate before.

72
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.104
They don't teach us how.

73
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.814
I need you to try. Try hard.

74
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.570
I still have a competition to win.

75
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.644
I think...

76
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.044
I think it's broken on our end.

77
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.934
Hey!

78
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.444
Pick it up.

79
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.014
What?

80
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.620
You're a Team Chronicle.
You need to record this!

81
00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:22.874
There's nothing to record.

82
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.874
My team didn't make it through.

83
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.874
There's enough of my team to compete.

84
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.754
We need a Chronicle to prove our win.

85
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.154
You're one of us now. shrimp.

86
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.244
My name's Kit!

87
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.644
Kyle Ian Troy.

88
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.984
Well now you're a Gemini. Kit.

89
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.570
Now pick it up!

90
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.000
Lee?

91
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.244
What about the rest of them?

92
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.244
Leave 'em.

93
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.244
They're just dead weight.

94
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.444
A lot of our team didn't make it through.

95
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.074
We could use the extra hands.

96
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.014
The rest of you. you're coming with us.

97
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.904
You're all from Gemini now.

98
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.850
I'm not on your team.

99
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.644
Why should I follow you?

100
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.214
Your teammates aren't coming.

101
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.814
Face it.

102
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.384
Come with us and you may
get credit as part of our team.

103
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.444
Don't want to be one of us? Then stay.

104
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.674
You can be our competition...

105
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.880
Your call.

106
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.134
This isn't right.

107
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.354
The games are supposed
to be on a forest world.

108
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.704
Make sure to include
that in your Chronicle.

109
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.534
Judges won't believe this
unless they see proof.

110
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.474
Maybe we'll get a special
honor for winning out here.

111
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.554
Do you think this happened
to the girl's Games too?

112
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.880
We'd have heard wouldn't we?

113
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.674
If we're going to find Sol
first we need to set up.

114
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.674
learn the area.

115
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.674
Scouts. this way. Scour the place.

116
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.740
Find anything that might be useful.

117
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.044
I know you!

118
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.874
You're the guy that won last year.

119
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.754
You won Sol Invictus!

120
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.474
But... You were disqualified weren't you?

121
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.844
That's right! You were DQ'd for cheating.

122
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.614
Must have been embarrassing
to have that taken away.

123
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.614
I'd watch what I was saying

124
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.334
if I didn't have my team here
to back me up...

125
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.844
Maybe you should.

126
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.000
You two. you know each other?

127
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.534
We used to.

128
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.584
What class are you?

129
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.784
Astronomer.

130
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.334
I'm Eli from Virgo.

131
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.334
We've already got an Astronomer.

132
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.334
Lee. should we drop this one?

133
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.522
What about you?

134
00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:57.504
Me?

135
00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.044
You're scouts now.

136
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.184
Find everything you can about this place.

137
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.984
But we don't have weapons.
What if it's dangerous?

138
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.984
Then you'll be the first to know.

139
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.984
Strength in numbers. right?

140
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.384
Rest of you scouts. let's move out!

141
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.614
I want camp set up before sunset!

142
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.280
We've got a lot of stars to search through.

143
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.044
This could go on for miles.

144
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.650
And I think the air is thinner out here.

145
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.954
They're not going to send
any search parties.

146
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.954
They don't send help.

147
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.444
But we're on the wrong planet.
Won't they come looking?

148
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.104
You sure they know something's wrong?

149
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.334
Did you hear that? Listen...

150
00:08:51.458 --> 00:08:53.858
Eli. wait!

151
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.154
An ocean?!

152
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.310
I've never seen a real one before...

153
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.074
How much do you think
this is worth back home?

154
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.244
Hard to tell.

155
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.554
It could go on forever.

156
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.304
But it's fresh water that they need.

157
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.274
What should we do about the Geminis?

158
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.340
Should we run?

159
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.200
Then what?

160
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.554
Don't say that to me!

161
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.554
What do you mean there's no food?

162
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.814
You're the Chef.

163
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.334
It's your job to make sure everyone is fed!

164
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.334
I know that.

165
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.540
It's just: all our food
was with the Porters.

166
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.510
I've got a few essentials but nothing else.

167
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.140
There's not enough for everyone...

168
00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:10.357
Kit! What are you doing?!
Record this!

169
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.834
We have to go!

170
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.084
If we get to water maybe they can't swim!

171
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.054
I'm not going out there!

172
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.774
If we get to the ocean we might make it!

173
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.774
We can't make it!

174
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.854
You made it! How?

175
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.654
Spent the night in a tree.

176
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.634
Those - whatever they are - hunters

177
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.004
lost interest in me a few hours ago.

178
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.100
Took the rest and left.

179
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.804
It's still running!

180
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.854
Maybe we can see... what happened.

181
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.780
No one should see what those things do.

182
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.804
Just the four of us?

183
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.854
We're all that made it?

184
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.514
What are you doing?!

185
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.234
You can't just leave.

186
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.574
Look what staying in a group
got the rest of them.

187
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.604
I'm going solo.

188
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.604
I got to camp first so this stuff is mine.

189
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.604
That's not fair you were
the first to run too!

190
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.684
This stuff is mine!

191
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.114
You want to prove it. shrimp?

192
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.204
My name is Kit!

193
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.174
Keep quiet!

194
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.174
We're not splitting up.

195
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.914
If the Geminis can put
together a team so can we.

196
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.514
They didn't know about
the Hunters but now we do.

197
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.034
We don't even have half a team.

198
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.314
You know the rules...

199
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.974
There's still a team
as long as there's a Captain.

200
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.974
I know the rules.

201
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.374
You're an Astronomer.
I don't have to listen to you.

202
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.750
Don't listen to me then.

203
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.344
Listen to Tyl.

204
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.150
He's the only Team Captain now.

205
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.144
What are you doing!?

206
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.284
I want as many eyes watching
my back as possible.

207
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.884
The best chance we have
is if we stick together. right?

208
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.144
Yeah but-

209
00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.434
Then you have to force them into a team!

210
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.500
But I'm not a Captain!

211
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.804
You are now.

212
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.520
So start acting like it.

213
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.834
The games are over!

214
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.314
There's gotta be someone
here with a communicator.

215
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.774
I'm calling home.

216
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.174
If someone was out here
we'd have seen them.

217
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.814
We're alone.

218
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.414
Then what are we supposed to do?

219
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.730
We still have a telescope.

220
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.113
We followed the Geminis because
they were supposed to win

221
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.680
and get us picked up.

222
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.014
We'll just do the same.

223
00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.040
And those Hunters?

224
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.454
We'll stick to the shore
so we can see them coming.

225
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.084
Maybe they can't swim.

226
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.454
Scorpius team is still out there...

227
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.404
They'll finish what those Hunters started.

228
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.714
I'm safer hiding on my own.

229
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.980
Do me a favor and stay away from me.

230
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.654
Just because we're in this together
doesn't mean we're a team.

231
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.794
I'm only following you
because you have the scope.

232
00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.120
I don't think so...

233
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.504
Tyl. the lens is cracked.

234
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.500
What?!

235
00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.834
See? Crack runs the whole length.

236
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.484
Great! You couldn't spot shit with that!

237
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.104
Now what. Team Captain!?

238
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.064
Rescue party!

239
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.344
Do you see anything!?

240
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.704
Guys?

241
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.900
We're not alone out here...

242
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.420
What do you mean?

243
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.750
See for yourself.

244
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.254
Doesn't look like a rescue party.

245
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.654
Should we talk to him?

246
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.774
I don't know.

247
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.034
I've heard stories about
strange people off-world.

248
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.610
What's he doing here?

249
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.900
Whatever you do. you better hurry.

250
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.464
Where are you from!?

251
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:08.724
Scorpius? Virgo? Corona?

252
00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:09.943
I'm not from any of those!

253
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.064
Did you kill somebody who was
and take his gear?

254
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.334
It's nothing like that!

255
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.200
I'll be the judge of that!

256
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.545
You don't know what you're doing!
Let go of me!

257
00:17:19.612 --> 00:17:20.951
You don't know what you're doing!

258
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.017
You can't trust the other Academies!

259
00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.710
I know! But he's not from an Academy.

260
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.530
How'd you get here?

261
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.654
I was late for the start so
they just sent me through.

262
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.944
Did they say anything about
trouble with the Gates?!

263
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.620
No it was business as usual. Why?

264
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.174
Do you have a communicator?

265
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.270
My teammates have all that.

266
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.270
Where's my team?

267
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.210
They didn't make it.

268
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.884
You can be sad later.
We need to find a way home.

269
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.574
Do you have any equipment we can use?

270
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.714
It was all broken when I got here
so I dropped it.

271
00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.804
Where did you leave it?

272
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.144
There was nothing worthwhile left.

273
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.600
I'm positive.

274
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.150
We'll be the judge of that.

275
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.320
There it is.

276
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.744
That's close enough!

277
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.604
Where's the rest of your team?

278
00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.254
I hid.

279
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.404
The rest didn't.

280
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.204
But it looks like my fortunes have turned.

281
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.854
Step back.

282
00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.484
How'd you get a gun through the Gate?

283
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.484
Made it with his stuff.

284
00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.344
That's all the valuables the half-wit left.

285
00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.774
Gate must have ruined the rest.

286
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.434
But you seem like a guy
with a lot more to give.

287
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.684
What do you want?

288
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.684
Your telescope for starters.

289
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.544
Mine needs some parts

290
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.434
and you're gonna give them to me.

291
00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.434
Is this all in your party?

292
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.884
You got a camp nearby?

293
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.314
You're gonna give me all your belongings

294
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.454
and I'll consider letting
you live to be rescued.

295
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.254
We're dead without our stuff
and you know it.

296
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.514
Not my problem.

297
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.974
No. You can't have it.

298
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.684
Show me your camp or I can just

299
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.810
kill you and find it myself!

300
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.409
He's a kid!

301
00:19:23.476 --> 00:19:24.914
He'll just die on his own anyway.

302
00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.574
You need parts and so do we.

303
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.454
Does your telescope have a lens?

304
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.654
Put it in ours and we can work together.

305
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.684
We can all go home tonight.

306
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.350
Tell your friend to come over.

307
00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.140
You didn't bring a tent
but you brought that?

308
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.620
It helps me when I'm nervous.

309
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.334
Tyl. you're Team Captain.

310
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.400
You get first try.

311
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.840
Let me show you how it's done!

312
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.580
There it is.

313
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.434
What?!

314
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.144
This thing is broken!

315
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.504
You rigged it!

316
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.200
Would we really rig it to cheat ourselves?

317
00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.544
We can't do this without
the rest of our teams.

318
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.544
We need their equipment.

319
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:18.240
What else can we do? We have to try.

320
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.974
I have no idea where Sol is. Do you?

321
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.144
Why can't you just find it?

322
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.574
We have no tools!

323
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.144
No idea where we are

324
00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.130
and no idea where our sun is hiding!

325
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.814
You're so smart?

326
00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.770
Find it yourself.

327
00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.984
Can I sleep in here?

328
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.440
Come on. Kit.

329
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.584
We need to rest.

330
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.820
Come on Kit. we'll look again tomorrow.

331
00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.060
Do you think rescue ships
will scout this area soon?

332
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.574
I don't think they know anything's wrong.

333
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.574
Even if they did

334
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.600
it could take months for them to find us.

335
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.440
Maybe years...

336
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.174
We'll just have to survive
long enough to win.

337
00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.880
They put us in teams
for the best chance of survival.

338
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.974
We're gonna keep doing it that way.

339
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.347
Hal. you're a cook right?

340
00:23:15.414 --> 00:23:17.084
It's you're job to make sure we can eat.

341
00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.284
But there's nothing out there!
I can't work like this!

342
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.634
None of us should have to.

343
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.344
We all have to pickup duties
we didn't want.

344
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.344
Adrian. you're offense?
Find anything you can out here.

345
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.774
Especially water...

346
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.774
I'm Security against other teams.

347
00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.774
That makes me second in command.

348
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.204
You can't reassign me.

349
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.804
All the other teams are dead.

350
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.804
You're a Scout now.

351
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.804
Lex. you're a Technician.

352
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.804
Kit. you're a Chronicle?

353
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:42.884
Keep recording.

354
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.974
If we do get back you're the only one

355
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.034
that can prove we didn't cheat.

356
00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.100
We're all a team now.

357
00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.204
Gone...

358
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.204
It's all gone.

359
00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.454
There has to be good water somewhere.

360
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.144
We just have to find it.

361
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.210
What are we supposed to do till then?

362
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.270
Stop sweating?

363
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.610
I can't keep going on like this.

364
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.544
He's got water!

365
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:35.544
What?

366
00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.254
There! In his jacket!

367
00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.254
I don't have any water!

368
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.974
If I did I wouldn't share it with you...

369
00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.204
His lips are wet.

370
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.774
You think I've got water?

371
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.114
Try and take it.

372
00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.180
See what happens.

373
00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.654
Howard. wait!

374
00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:10.350
Don't drink that!
You're gonna make it worse!

375
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.840
It's fresh...

376
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.604
Fresh! It's fresh!

377
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.604
Fresh water!

378
00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:22.604
Can you imagine what
this is worth back home?

379
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.434
They could stop drilling the moon.

380
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.884
And Europa...

381
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.278
This could change everything!

382
00:25:30.134 --> 00:25:32.044
How could they have missed this?

383
00:25:32.111 --> 00:25:35.016
The Gate must have been built
before the oceans dried.

384
00:25:35.083 --> 00:25:36.861
They weren't looking.

385
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.654
Lex!

386
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.514
Hold him down!

387
00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.514
Kit! Water now!

388
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.884
Kit. come on!

389
00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.404
What happened?

390
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:20.804
I don't know. I don't know...

391
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.634
I was just trying to find Sol

392
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.544
and the damn thing shocked me!

393
00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.544
Nice job putting it together.

394
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.544
You trying to kill me?!

395
00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.040
What's this for?

396
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.670
Part of the scope is open.

397
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.344
You were trying to cheat!

398
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.054
You tried tricking it
to think you found Sol!

399
00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.714
But scopes are tamper proof!

400
00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.114
Yeah it shocked him in defense!

401
00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.114
Does it still work!?

402
00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.434
Yeah.

403
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.434
We should throw him out.

404
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.944
Before he pulls something like this again.

405
00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:59.234
Lex?

406
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.084
Do it! I dare you!

407
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:09.120
You need me as much as I need your stuff.

408
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.640
That's what I thought.

409
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.034
Thanks for the water!

410
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.574
You're not letting him get
away with that are you?

411
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.574
You have to kick him out!

412
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.854
I'm not doing that!

413
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.920
What if he cheats again. or does worse?

414
00:27:26.986 --> 00:27:27.974
What will you do?

415
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.284
Maybe we'll need his help! I don't know-

416
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:31.975
What do you know?!

417
00:27:32.042 --> 00:27:34.170
Have you ever led anyone?

418
00:27:34.237 --> 00:27:36.749
How long have you even been a Team Captain?

419
00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.484
No.

420
00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.550
You can't handle this.

421
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.914
Look for a clearing.

422
00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.524
Any opening big enough to gather logs.

423
00:28:08.591 --> 00:28:10.654
But we have a light.
we don't need to build a fire.

424
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.914
Not for that!

425
00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.174
Then what?

426
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.774
We're not making a fire. kid.

427
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.004
It's for a boat.

428
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.344
Why?

429
00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.344
We're leaving.

430
00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:24.780
Do you really want to stay
with those Hunters?

431
00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.314
What if this is the only land?

432
00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.004
You'd rather wait here to be eaten?

433
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:30.314
Look...

434
00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.484
This can't be the only land.

435
00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.204
Someone's gotta be out there.

436
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.654
And we can find 'em.

437
00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.720
And contact home.

438
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.114
Now go.

439
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.780
Find logs. Get good ones.

440
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.700
I can't hold on!

441
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:16.204
Lex!

442
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.714
I'm slipping!

443
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.714
Somebody help me!

444
00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.284
Anybody!

445
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:22.514
Help!

446
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.034
Hang on!

447
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.034
It's gonna pull us in too!

448
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.484
Help!

449
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.284
Tyl. help us!

450
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:06.314
We need your help! Hurry!

451
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.070
I think he's poisoned.

452
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.144
It's killing him.

453
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.670
What do we do?!

454
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.950
Right here!

455
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.700
The med-pack!

456
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.180
Here!

457
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.804
The venom's bad.
I don't know if he'll make it!

458
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:44.084
Here. you clean the wound!

459
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.084
Where's the sting kit!?

460
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:56.150
I'm looking!

461
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.884
Oh no. It's broken!

462
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:00.884
Are there more?

463
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:02.884
Hurry!

464
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:05.374
This is our last one.

465
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.714
Wait! We gotta save it.

466
00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.714
What?!

467
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.204
What if one of us gets stung?

468
00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.744
He's right.

469
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.374
Use it now and you won't
have one for yourself later.

470
00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.240
But he's hurt now!

471
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.314
Use it. Tyl!

472
00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.174
Think there could be
more of those things. Lex?

473
00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.500
If we're stuck here
it's not long till we find out.

474
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.980
We're not going to
make it out of here are we?

475
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.084
How long will this last?

476
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.114
They're coming!

477
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.114
I'm not staying here. Not again!

478
00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.574
Me neither!

479
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.574
He'll bring the Hunters right to us!

480
00:32:27.602 --> 00:32:28.574
Leave him!

481
00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.574
Someone has to stay and keep him quiet

482
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.574
or they'll find him for sure!

483
00:32:35.274 --> 00:32:37.434
Eli's the only one that
doesn't do his job anymore.

484
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.004
He's least essential.

485
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.004
Hey! I-

486
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.604
I record. Hal cooks. Lex fixes things

487
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.114
and Tyl saves people.

488
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.114
Have you found Sol yet?

489
00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.914
No but I try every night!

490
00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.374
He's right. Eli.

491
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.374
You're the least important.

492
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.804
Stay here with Adrian.

493
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.174
Okay...

494
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.174
Lex. is that gun still in your pack?

495
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.174
No. stay out of my pack!

496
00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.174
Leave it! No time!

497
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.774
There! At our camp.

498
00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.634
What are you doing?

499
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:57.034
If they go after Eli then
they won't come after us.

500
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.604
You tried to kill me!

501
00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:20.714
Don't pity yourself too much.
You look fine...

502
00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.004
Whatever you did to chase them off worked.

503
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.854
I didn't do anything!

504
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.380
Something kept them away...

505
00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.084
The light!

506
00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.004
What?

507
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.010
Maybe they're afraid of it.

508
00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.484
We have only seen them at night.

509
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.084
Maybe the light hurts them.

510
00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:48.804
Burns them.

511
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.804
Do you think it's just the lantern?

512
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:52.344
I don't know.

513
00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:56.580
But it's not gonna last forever...

514
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.314
As long as there are people on this island

515
00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:18.410
there will be a fire...

516
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.254
Are we sure this will work?

517
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.484
Will fire really keep them away?

518
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.884
I don't know.

519
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.884
When will we know!?

520
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:10.980
When the Hunters come and eat us or not!

521
00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.484
We should get some rest.

522
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.884
I can't sleep like this.

523
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.670
Me neither.

524
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.114
Where's Lex?

525
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.284
Who cares.

526
00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:52.700
We're almost out of wood.

527
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.544
Who's coming with?

528
00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.500
I can't go back out there.

529
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.840
Guess you were right about the light.

530
00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.054
What? What happened?!

531
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.100
We found something!

532
00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.234
I've never seen one before but...

533
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.834
I think it's a Stormrunner!

534
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.404
Can't be! That would mean it's

535
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:33.604
over two hundred years old...

536
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.750
Where's the rest of it?

537
00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.084
It's still intact!

538
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:52.114
What is?

539
00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.374
The computer core. it's still functional!

540
00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.514
But the control element's gone.

541
00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.314
Without that it's useless.

542
00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.314
Just needs a jump-start huh?

543
00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.314
This is a waste of our time. Tyl.

544
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.034
I didn't bring you here for nostalgia.

545
00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.744
I need help carrying something.

546
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.744
What are we supposed to do with this junk?!

547
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.744
Look how old it is!

548
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:17.144
That's not junk you're looking at.

549
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:19.854
There's a Trans-Conduit relay in there.

550
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.254
You sure?

551
00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.884
Checked it myself. Still works.

552
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:26.944
I know what you're thinking.

553
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:29.854
But if we screw this up
it could ruin the telescope.

554
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.100
Isn't it worth the risk?

555
00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:50.780
This was a Hyperion ship...

556
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:54.004
If the Hyperions couldn't survive here

557
00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:58.004
how are we supposed to?

558
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.854
A Trans-Conduit relay lets any computer

559
00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.914
connect to the network
that links every system.

560
00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.914
If we hook it to the scope

561
00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.434
we might be able to
send a message back to Earth.

562
00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:19.544
Let me do it.

563
00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:20.914
It's not that simple.

564
00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.234
Overload the conductor and

565
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.234
the whole thing's cooked!

566
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.714
That's why I'm doing it...

567
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.544
How long will it take to contact home?

568
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:30.714
It's not as easy as calling mom and dad...

569
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.374
Connecting with Terra-Net only lets us

570
00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.654
transmit messages to individual addresses.

571
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.604
If a message actually makes it...

572
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:40.604
They'll have to record their own reply

573
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.834
and hope it finds its way
back to the scope.

574
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.404
Which it won't.

575
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:46.744
If someone responds

576
00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:49.180
we can triangulate our position

577
00:41:49.247 --> 00:41:51.578
and have them send help.

578
00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.174
Here we go...

579
00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:57.870
Did you break it?

580
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.068
Can we fix it?

581
00:41:59.135 --> 00:42:00.720
It's fine. I just need my splicer.

582
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:01.744
Where is it?

583
00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:02.854
My pack. I'll get it.

584
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.720
No you keep working on it. Howard?

585
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.374
What are you doing with that?!

586
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.714
Shut your goddamn mouth!

587
00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:43.684
What's the matter?

588
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:45.544
Day 1: Assessed Slip Gate.

589
00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:47.514
Unable to establish return portal

590
00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.944
for more than three seconds.

591
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.944
Replaced coupler. No improvement.

592
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.574
Day 8: Gemini telescope battery

593
00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.004
unable to jump-start Gate.

594
00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:59.884
Day 20: Energy source to power Gate

595
00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.654
needs to be larger.

596
00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.144
Day 30: Found crashed ship.

597
00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:05.034
Should be able to salvage parts

598
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.314
to stabilize Gate.

599
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.774
He has been sneaking off

600
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.270
and working on the Slip Gate all this time!

601
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.210
Can you fix it?

602
00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.254
No.

603
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.254
We don't have the parts.

604
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.284
Why didn't you tell us?

605
00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:22.374
Because he didn't
want to bring us with him!

606
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.774
He was going to leave us here

607
00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.054
so that he can go home
and win the games on his own.

608
00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.054
I would have sent help when I got back!

609
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.434
You've been lying to us this whole time!

610
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.434
How do you know so much
about Slip Gates. Lex?

611
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.204
Nobody's allowed to learn how they work-

612
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.204
You did this. didn't you?

613
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.204
Didn't you!?

614
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:41.914
You sabotaged the Slip Gate network...

615
00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:43.484
You rigged it so we'd be stuck

616
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.804
on this backwater planet
with no chance of winning.

617
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.254
But you did too good of a job.

618
00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.004
Your team crashed the network so bad

619
00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:51.774
that it sucked everyone in.

620
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.774
You fell into your own trap.

621
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.944
Is he right?

622
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.144
Tell us!

623
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:57.204
Why'd you do it!?

624
00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.210
Because I have to win!

625
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:06.100
If I don't bring back that Hyperion coin...

626
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:09.634
You wouldn't understand.

627
00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.854
I had to do it!

628
00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.944
Everything that's happened...

629
00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:15.944
Everything!

630
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:17.174
It's all your fault.

631
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.854
That night with the Hunters

632
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.284
you tried killing me to hide the journal.

633
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:22.914
Instead I saved you!

634
00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.484
Where would we be if we didn't
learn what light can do?!

635
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.944
And the rest?

636
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:31.004
This is Sol Invictus.

637
00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:33.404
Winning's the only rule.

638
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.834
They should have known
what they were getting in to.

639
00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:37.634
Wrap it however you want.

640
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.514
If you hadn't done that. we'd be home now!

641
00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.640
And innocent people would still be alive.

642
00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.900
I feel sorry for you.

643
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.254
What are we gonna do with him?

644
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.974
Can't trust him anymore.

645
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.204
Before you do anything rash.

646
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:07.150
afraid I need him over here.

647
00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.944
The relay's almost done.

648
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:12.780
Go.

649
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:33.884
The signal's too weak.

650
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:35.343
That's as good as we're gonna get.

651
00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:37.404
That won't get the messages
half way to Earth!

652
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:40.320
Then we'll try anyway!

653
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:48.574
This is Lex of Scorpius
to anyone at command.

654
00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.150
Hi. Mom and Dad...

655
00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:54.514
By now you've probably heard from school.

656
00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:57.404
We've no idea where we are.

657
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:59.404
Nobody does.

658
00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:01.404
My assignment

659
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:04.884
did more than we could have imagined.

660
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.634
Trapping me on the same

661
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.574
unknown planet as the rest of them.

662
00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.350
Why did I come out here?

663
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.514
Was I wrong about all this?

664
00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.974
Everything I did.

665
00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.670
I did for the mission.

666
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.454
Please respond.

667
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.084
Please...

668
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:42.684
Say anything.

669
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:45.410
I'll win.

670
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:48.004
One way or the other.

671
00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:50.234
I can't wait to get home.

672
00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.774
I love you guys.

673
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.840
See you soon.

674
00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.484
Say anything...

675
00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:01.500
I just want to hear from you.

676
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.040
Let's send these things!

677
00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:22.210
Enter the address here.

678
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.344
This is it!

679
00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.084
That's it?

680
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:46.834
What were you expecting.
an instant response?

681
00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.834
It could take hours
for them to reach everyone.

682
00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.004
Then leave it on all night.

683
00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:53.100
I want to know the instant we get a reply!

684
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.950
I wonder what it looks like from up there.

685
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.470
From all those other fires.

686
00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:31.580
Want to check yours?

687
00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:36.514
That's enough.

688
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.034
Time to turn it off.

689
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.174
Wait!

690
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.091
I want to know when they hear from me.

691
00:49:41.158 --> 00:49:43.305
If we leave it on any longer
we'll kill the battery.

692
00:49:43.372 --> 00:49:45.240
No!

693
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.744
Wait! I want to hear back!

694
00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:49.454
Turn it off or we're really screwed!

695
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.684
Give it to me!

696
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:52.750
Let it go!

697
00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:04.454
Give it to me.

698
00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.010
So you're gonna shoot me now!?

699
00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.714
Give me the gun. Kit!

700
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:10.854
No!

701
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.454
Kit. give me the gun!

702
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.034
Kit!

703
00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.914
Give me the gun!

704
00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.914
No!

705
00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:35.634
What'd you do!?

706
00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.004
It was an accident!

707
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:38.914
I- I didn't...

708
00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:40.980
What have you done?!

709
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.634
Eli. please just hold still.

710
00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.634
Just give me a second!

711
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.744
Eli!

712
00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.604
Of course it was his fault!

713
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:12.604
Okay! You're right. But...

714
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:14.084
He didn't mean to-

715
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:17.150
He feels even worse about it than you do.

716
00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:21.040
You can't make him sleep outside forever.

717
00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:34.884
You got us into this mess.

718
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:37.380
it's your job to get us out.

719
00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:40.574
You're in charge now.

720
00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.944
Time to stop waiting.

721
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.374
No way...

722
00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:13.574
Message received?

723
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.114
Message received?!

724
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.114
Message received!

725
00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.854
We got one! We got a reply!

726
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.034
Somebody sent a response!

727
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.434
Somebody heard from us!?

728
00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.884
Tyl. somebody sent a reply!

729
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.834
Eli VO: Hi. Mom and Dad.

730
00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.254
We haven't received a response.

731
00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.520
It's one of our own messages
bounced back to us.

732
00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:37.774
It didn't even make it out of the system.

733
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.514
No one received any messages.

734
00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:43.580
No one ever will!

735
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.314
I can't believe we thought
this thing would work.

736
00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:50.004
Wait a second!

737
00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:52.004
Just one of the messages bounced back.

738
00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:53.974
Others could still make it through!

739
00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:57.144
But if you break the telescope
we'll never know!

740
00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:59.144
To think I let you

741
00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:01.684
get my hopes up. Hal.

742
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:03.684
You couldn't even check the message.

743
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:07.580
You just started dancing
around like a fat fool!

744
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.054
You broke my gun.

745
00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.054
We lost our food because of you!

746
00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.454
How could anybody be so stupid

747
00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.454
and yet still be alive?!

748
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.084
You've gotta be the most hapless oaf

749
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:21.034
I've ever seen in my life!

750
00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.744
Stop it! Hal. stop!

751
00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.714
I shouldn't be here.

752
00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:40.144
I want to go home.

753
00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.834
I want to go home!

754
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:49.574
None of this was supposed to happen...

755
00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.750
What was I thinking?

756
00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.404
We can't build a boat!

757
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:16.974
Haven't you seen what's out there?
We'd never make it!

758
00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:17.944
We're trapped!

759
00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:19.114
It's our only option.

760
00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:21.834
Would you rather die here
or trying to find help?!

761
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:24.054
There's no one out there to help us!

762
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.054
It's up to us to make it back!

763
00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.054
You put me in charge. remember?

764
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.884
Or do you think you can do better?

765
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:32.174
Tyl might listen to you. but I'm not.

766
00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.744
I'm not going out there!
I'm not making a boat!

767
00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:36.284
Then you can live on your own.

768
00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:39.974
If you're not working
I'm kicking you out of my camp!

769
00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.834
This wouldn't be such a problem

770
00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.834
if you hadn't murdered our only Astronomer!

771
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.320
Hey!

772
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:57.350
You look like shit.

773
00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:00.470
What's going on?

774
00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:05.920
Here that long. huh?

775
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:09.780
Any more ideas how we got here?

776
00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:14.654
No.

777
00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.654
There is

778
00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.010
one other option.

779
00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:21.254
Every year the Board of Governors

780
00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.410
sends out a judge in each team to observe.

781
00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:26.854
No one ever knows about it.

782
00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.544
The judges pick a contestant
from every team.

783
00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.610
make sure they can trust him.

784
00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:35.344
and assign him to report back on the games.

785
00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:38.980
Sometimes I bet they even rig it.

786
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:45.054
How'd you find this out?

787
00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.840
I talked it out of someone last year.

788
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:50.374
Now.

789
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.270
No one can come home till someone's won.

790
00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:55.684
These judges do it all the time.

791
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.834
Pop home to report then slip right back.

792
00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:00.834
Say they'd gone to
the bathroom or something.

793
00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:03.500
I know how to contact the Gate Ops.

794
00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:06.174
Tell 'em you're a student judge.

795
00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.854
and they'll bring you home.

796
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.854
If you were right

797
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.854
I would have heard about it.

798
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.054
How can we believe you?

799
00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.350
Because Shrimp.

800
00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:19.720
that's how I got home first.

801
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.804
That's how I cheated.

802
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:24.574
I told the Slip Gate Operators

803
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.714
that I was a judge.

804
00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:28.054
When I came out I raised my scope

805
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.380
and said I'd found Sol.

806
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.484
The Gate Ops don't talk but

807
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:35.634
the judges figured it out.

808
00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:38.484
There's no way to contact home
or I'd have done it.

809
00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:40.054
There's one.

810
00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:43.854
That Hyperion ship
still has a working core.

811
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.454
Your scope is programmed for the Gate Ops.

812
00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:48.084
If you run it through the ship

813
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:49.544
it'll let you call for a pick-up.

814
00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:51.180
No.

815
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.084
The control element's missing.

816
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:56.440
We'd never find it out here.

817
00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.374
You knew a way home

818
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.054
and you didn't tell us?

819
00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.854
What were you waiting for?!

820
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.974
When they realize we cheated
they'll come after us

821
00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.974
with everything they have.

822
00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.500
We'd be better off staying here.

823
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.604
You made it back...

824
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:16.174
It took

825
00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:19.950
everything my family had to get me back in.

826
00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.854
I'd never do it again either.

827
00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.254
If not for all this.

828
00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.580
But look at all that's happened.

829
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:30.834
Wouldn't they understand?

830
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.404
Believe me.

831
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:34.810
they won't care.

832
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:37.284
If you try and explain beforehand

833
00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:38.834
you'll just blow your cover.

834
00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:40.634
Is it really that bad?

835
00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:42.634
When you stand before them

836
00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:45.980
and see your entire future slipping away.

837
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:49.774
Remember how you felt today.

838
00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.774
Cause whoever gives them their name

839
00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.780
that's the one they'll come after worst.

840
00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:57.520
He's done.

841
00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.914
We'll do it.

842
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.714
No.

843
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:03.314
No we won't.

844
00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:05.314
I'm in charge now remember?

845
00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:07.804
I just want to go home.

846
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:09.144
More than anything.

847
00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:10.540
I'm sorry. I am.

848
00:59:10.607 --> 00:59:12.484
I want to go home too
but there's another way

849
00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:14.544
off this planet and I'm gonna find it.

850
00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:18.350
You can't have the scope. I'm sorry.

851
00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:20.234
Wait. Lex-

852
00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:21.920
No!

853
00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:00.654
Where's the scope?!

854
01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.804
It's gone!

855
01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:03.574
Could he have gone to look for Sol?

856
01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.774
We gotta find him!

857
01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.574
He could be anywhere by now. How can we-

858
01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.574
Quiet!

859
01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.004
Listen.

860
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:17.120
Your camera's still connected to it.

861
01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.520
I see something.

862
01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.054
Hal? Hal?

863
01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.350
Hal. what's going on!?

864
01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:29.544
I'm taking the scope.

865
01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:31.374
I won't let your ruin this. I'm going home!

866
01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.744
But we need the scope.
You can't just take it!

867
01:00:33.810 --> 01:00:35.744
You know we'll never find Sol!

868
01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:38.574
But at least if I call home
we can finally leave.

869
01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.774
What about us?
Somebody has to take the fall!

870
01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.454
Don't we get a say in it?!

871
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.714
I'm sorry.

872
01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:47.034
but I don't care about the tournament.

873
01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.470
I can live with the consequences.

874
01:00:48.537 --> 01:00:50.714
my family needs me home.

875
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.974
You wouldn't understand.

876
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.284
It's easy for you to talk big

877
01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.314
when you're the one
running with our telescope!

878
01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:56.654
What would you know?

879
01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.834
I'm doing it to help someone.

880
01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.234
You guys have never thought

881
01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.300
about anybody but yourselves!

882
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.004
No...

883
01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:09.574
Hal! Do you have a light?

884
01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.914
You need to get back to camp. Hurry!

885
01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.714
I think I hear something.

886
01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.574
Where are you. Hal?

887
01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.171
I'm in the forest.

888
01:01:17.238 --> 01:01:18.974
That's their forest.
That's where they live!

889
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.514
Listen! Hide.
We're coming for you right now.

890
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.084
Hal. run!

891
01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.344
You had your chance!

892
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.634
You don't know what you're doing!

893
01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.180
Why should we trust you now?

894
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:54.380
Because I know what to do.

895
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:58.780
I'm getting us home.

896
01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:01.374
It's Tyl's team.

897
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.840
I'm with him.

898
01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:21.744
If I do this.

899
01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:25.320
do you promise you'll get us home?

900
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:31.700
I promise.

901
01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:44.174
It's not safe to split up.

902
01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.684
We'll just have to comb the whole forest.

903
01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.634
No point delaying the inevitable.

904
01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.544
It's quiet here.

905
01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:29.100
I don't like it.

906
01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.950
There it is.

907
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.084
Let's make a break for it.

908
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:50.604
Wait.

909
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:53.604
Whatever did this could still be here.

910
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:40.144
The telescope!

911
01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:41.434
Is it okay?!

912
01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:42.714
It's fine!

913
01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.780
But look...

914
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:55.604
I think-

915
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:58.670
I think they took Hal down there.

916
01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:02.514
Can you see anything?

917
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:04.284
There are tunnels inside.

918
01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:06.144
Long ones...

919
01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:08.670
I can't see the ends.

920
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:12.604
It must be where they go during the day.

921
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:15.144
There could be a whole world down there.

922
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:17.750
Even bigger than the island.

923
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:22.604
Then let's keep it down there.

924
01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:31.010
This is the only way out.

925
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:34.300
Are you sure?

926
01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:37.440
Unless those things can fly.

927
01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:44.270
Do you think it'll be able to stop 'em?

928
01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.410
I don't know.

929
01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:03.580
Stop! Listen!

930
01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.804
They're not coming!

931
01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:15.344
It worked.

932
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:17.300
It works!

933
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.440
Are we sure it'll last all night?

934
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:22.774
I hope.

935
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.774
We'll have to keep the fire going.

936
01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.174
I'll take tomorrow.

937
01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.454
Then Lex. Then you. Kit.

938
01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.750
We'll keep them trapped forever.

939
01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:34.204
I wonder if they'll start to eat each other

940
01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:36.514
when they realize they're never leaving.

941
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.870
Are you sure you're ready?

942
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.520
Then let's go home.

943
01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.944
The core's still intact.

944
01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.114
All we need is the control element.

945
01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.640
No.

946
01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.834
Not like this.

947
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.314
I can't go home like that.

948
01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.950
It's time to go home!

949
01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:06.084
Tyl. that's not gonna work.

950
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:07.700
Main power's offline.

951
01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.144
Then what can we do?

952
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:12.900
I can do it.

953
01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.054
Let me try.

954
01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.544
One wrong wire

955
01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:17.544
and he could fry the whole computer.

956
01:08:17.610 --> 01:08:21.100
If he ever wanted to
screw us over it would be now.

957
01:08:21.844 --> 01:08:23.727
Can you get it to work?

958
01:08:23.805 --> 01:08:24.634
No!

959
01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.054
I'm sorry but how can we trust him?

960
01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.120
Because.

961
01:08:30.010 --> 01:08:32.320
He's better than that.

962
01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:35.670
Fix it.

963
01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.204
Slip Gate Operator: Come in.
this is Slip Gate Control.

964
01:09:19.270 --> 01:09:20.174
Hello?

965
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.174
Gate Op: Who's this? Identify yourself.

966
01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.174
I'm a student judge in the
Sol Invictus games.

967
01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.174
Requesting immediate transit back to Earth

968
01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.314
for a report.

969
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:30.144
Gate Op: Sol Invictus? That was weeks ago.

970
01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:31.834
We thought you were all dead.

971
01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.254
We're not.

972
01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:34.204
Not yet.

973
01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:35.404
Gate Op: I don't believe it.

974
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:37.084
We need to get you back for debrief.

975
01:09:37.150 --> 01:09:38.054
What's your name?

976
01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:38.935
My name?

977
01:09:39.002 --> 01:09:40.884
Gate Op: Every portal needs
a record on file

978
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:44.544
for who authorized it.
Especially student judges.

979
01:09:44.610 --> 01:09:47.670
Give me your name.

980
01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.034
Kit. Kit of Capricorn.

981
01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.174
I take full responsibility.

982
01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.544
I need a portal back to Earth immediately.

983
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:57.054
The Gate here was damaged.

984
01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.518
I can't get a portal up.

985
01:09:58.585 --> 01:10:00.114
I need you to open one on your end.

986
01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.774
We can still activate one from Earth.

987
01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.684
All I need is your planet code.

988
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:05.834
Give it to me and we'll
have you home by nightfall.

989
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.076
Can't you tell me where I am?

990
01:10:07.143 --> 01:10:08.514
We don't know where you landed.

991
01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.054
Now we can open a portal

992
01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.604
but only if we know which one to use.

993
01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:14.854
Without that there's
no way to get you home.

994
01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.454
Then open all the Gates in the system!

995
01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.144
Do you have any idea how many that is?

996
01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:20.054
The resources that would waste?!

997
01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.484
You know we can't do that.

998
01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:23.284
What about a rescue party?

999
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:24.744
Can you send anyone?

1000
01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:25.744
We can't.

1001
01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:29.084
You could be in any corner of the galaxy.

1002
01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:31.654
What are you saying?

1003
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.654
You know what I'm saying.

1004
01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.314
If we don't know what planet you're on.

1005
01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.634
there's nothing we can do.

1006
01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.174
I know this is hard to hear

1007
01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.254
but you're not coming home.

1008
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.684
I'm sorry.

1009
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:45.684
Gate Control out...

1010
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:54.180
We got so close...

1011
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:58.054
Now we're even further
than when we started.

1012
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.720
How could this have happened to us?

1013
01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.380
I'm sorry.

1014
01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.054
I'm really sorry.

1015
01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.470
We're never going home.

1016
01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.054
What is home?

1017
01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.120
This isn't.

1018
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.520
It could never be.

1019
01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:25.144
The fire's almost out.

1020
01:11:25.210 --> 01:11:27.204
Maybe you should put some wood on it.

1021
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:29.270
What's the point?

1022
01:11:30.143 --> 01:11:31.004
Where are you going?

1023
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:33.720
Does it even matter anymore?!

1024
01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.544
My name is Tyl of Libra.

1025
01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:10.544
The date?

1026
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:12.884
I don't even know.

1027
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:15.054
If you found this telescope then you're

1028
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.714
probably stranded here too.

1029
01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.454
If that's the case.

1030
01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:21.640
then I'm sorry.

1031
01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.774
My only advice is-

1032
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.174
No...

1033
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:35.804
Message VO: Eli?
Eli. I just saw your message.

1034
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:38.544
Where are you? What happened?

1035
01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:40.544
We're so worried.

1036
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:42.604
Your father and I
have been trying to find you

1037
01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:44.654
and no one will tell us anything.

1038
01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.434
They just said there was an accident

1039
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.114
with the Slip Gates.

1040
01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.684
We thought you were lost...

1041
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:52.404
I am so glad you're okay!

1042
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:54.604
We'll never give up on finding you.

1043
01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:58.054
Even if we have to search
every planet ourselves.

1044
01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.174
We will find you.

1045
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.744
I'll see you soon. son.

1046
01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:04.114
I love you.

1047
01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.484
What do you want me to do?

1048
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.914
I don't know what to tell her!

1049
01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:13.470
If I send a response...

1050
01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.470
Wait...

1051
01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.714
Send a response!

1052
01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.084
Trace that message!

1053
01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:22.374
Point of origin.

1054
01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.254
Ignore!

1055
01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.284
You're all the way over there?

1056
01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.840
Oh come on!

1057
01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:53.484
Not yet you're not! Come on!

1058
01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:30.810
There you are...

1059
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:33.684
Wait.

1060
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:35.684
If you're Sol...

1061
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:38.720
You can be my reference point!

1062
01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:41.854
Triangulate position.

1063
01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.974
Point of reference.

1064
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.484
Using that star.

1065
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:51.914
As Sol...

1066
01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.234
Cygnus B-7.

1067
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.714
Cygnus B-7!

1068
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.974
Gate Op: Gate Control.
Come in this is Gate Control.

1069
01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.254
I'm a Sol contestant!

1070
01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.604
I need immediate transit-

1071
01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:14.254
Gate Op: Kid. I'm sorry.

1072
01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.974
But unless you've got a planet code

1073
01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.034
I've got nothing else-

1074
01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.034
Cygnus B-7!

1075
01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.144
We're on Cygnus B-7!

1076
01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:22.714
Gate Op: Cygnus B-7...

1077
01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:24.714
Cygnus B-7?!

1078
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.100
You're all the way out there!?

1079
01:15:26.412 --> 01:15:29.804
That's an H Class planet.
Unsafe for human habitation!

1080
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:30.854
How did you-

1081
01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.234
Never mind! Listen!

1082
01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:34.374
Get to the Slip Gate as fast as you can.

1083
01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.374
I just sent through the activation command.

1084
01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.914
A portal will be up soon.

1085
01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:39.454
Wait! You gotta delay it!

1086
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.834
I have to find my friends first!

1087
01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.114
That gate's not stable
enough to hold for long!

1088
01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:45.974
A few minutes tops
and it's gonna collapse for good!

1089
01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.574
Come home now while you still can!

1090
01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:10.084
Take Adrian and get to the Slip Gate!

1091
01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:11.544
What about you?!

1092
01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:13.610
I gotta find Lex!

1093
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:27.254
We don't have any time! You go ahead!

1094
01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.254
No! We're all going home!

1095
01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.684
Give him to me!

1096
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:32.750
Go!

1097
01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:41.670
Let's go! Hurry!

1098
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.144
Did you hear that?

1099
01:16:47.210 --> 01:16:48.374
Don't worry about it!

1100
01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.544
They do that every night

1101
01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:51.520
when they're burned by the fire!

1102
01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.834
Should be ready in a few minutes!

1103
01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:57.210
Wait!

1104
01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:01.374
That one didn't come from the forest.

1105
01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.374
How did they-

1106
01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.084
Kit! You didn't-

1107
01:17:06.150 --> 01:17:07.810
I'm sorry!

1108
01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:10.174
I didn't think we'd make it.

1109
01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.174
It's not gonna form in time!

1110
01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.484
If we run we might
be able to get away from them!

1111
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:17.854
The portal's gonna collapse!

1112
01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.374
It can't re-open after this!

1113
01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:22.254
We can try and fix it
later but right now we have to-

1114
01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:24.524
Run!

1115
01:17:24.591 --> 01:17:25.774
No!

1116
01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:28.084
We're not running anymore!

1117
01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:29.204
You're going home.

1118
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:30.114
What?!

1119
01:17:30.181 --> 01:17:31.374
No we can't leave you!

1120
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.034
I'll buy you some time.

1121
01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.514
Take Adrian with you.

1122
01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:36.840
Take Adrian!

1123
01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:40.144
Take it!

1124
01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.204
Go home.

1125
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:45.654
What are you doing. Tyl?!

1126
01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:48.470
Have you even thought about this?!

1127
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:57.714
Go home. guys.

1128
01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:32.204
VO: Here we stand.

1129
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:35.180
on the shoulders of giants.

1130
01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:37.544
These are our words.

1131
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:40.070
And our sacred charge.

1132
01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.980
Greatness is the foundation of our world.

1133
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:47.344
Greatness let us survive
centuries of strife.

1134
01:19:47.410 --> 01:19:49.684
Tame the physical world to our will.

1135
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:51.834
And spread across the stars

1136
01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.914
at the speed of light.

1137
01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:58.514
That same greatness may be in you.

1138
01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:01.380
Now. it's time to find out...

1139
01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:31.040
Welcome to Sol Invictus...
