00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.600
Thank you very much. everyone.
for the sex worker

179
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.800
you sent to my home address.

180
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.600
Come on. you sly dog.

181
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.640
No. no. I-I paid for
the premium version.

182
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.160
They said if you get that. you can
have anything you want. I...

183
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.200
Oh. my God.

184
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.640
So. what did you ask for?

185
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.880
I asked him to clean my house.

186
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.320
(LAUGHS) What?

187
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.360
What was I supposed to do?

188
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.400
Thank you for thinking of me.
but if I want that I'll find it

189
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.840
in my own marriage.

190
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.360
Farley was fantastic for that.
I'll have you know.

191
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.800
Farley was over a year ago. Some
things happen in their own time.

192
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.320
Yeah. no. I mean. she's right. guys.
It's not like any of us singles

193
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.240
are getting any.
Apart from you. of course. Hayley.

194
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.600
It does.
It sounds amazing. actually.

195
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.880
having a man clean your house.

196
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.440
Did he have a six-pack?

197
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.280
Oh. please tell me he at least
took his shirt off. Did he?

198
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.760
It was a four-pack.

199
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.680
Oh. yes! (CLAPPING)
Yes. Gina!

200
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.480
(ALL LAUGHING)
Whoo!

201
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.760
Brett. I was looking at
those removals figures

202
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.920
and I think we're missing
a bit of. um...

203
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.240
It's just fatty tissue.

204
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.880
Sorry.
So. um. I thought...

205
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.960
Oh. You know you haven't remembered
my birthday for five years.

206
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.680
There was a restructure.

207
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.720
My hands were tied.

208
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.760
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.840
You'll get picked up straight away.

210
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.600
There will be some sort of package.

211
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.080
Who else did you let go?

212
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.760
Just yourself at present.

213
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.440
Here's your copies.
Now I'm almost done reconfiguring

214
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.560
the report system. and you need
to get a social strategist.

215
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.720
Can I get you something. Gina?

216
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.840
Yeah. you can take your double
D cups and you can piss off

217
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.280
back to your own department.

218
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.360
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

219
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.680
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
WOMAN: Do you think she's OK?

220
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.480
(EXHALES)

221
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.920
OK. I've got you a little
cheer up present.

222
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.520
Oh...
Now. it is a remote-controlled

223
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.680
internal vibrator.

224
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.720
So you wear it inside.
Oh. I...

225
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.680
No. It's movement controlled.
Bluetooth enabled.

226
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.760
It's amazing. I...
No. no. no.

227
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.800
I've got one.
It was a buy one. get one free

228
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.880
so this is for you.

229
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.920
Well. that-that is so lovely
of you to think of me.

230
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.280
No. I didn't think of you. I was
gonna give it to one of the others.

231
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.320
but clearly it has to be you.
Why? Why me?

232
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.640
Because you're gonna be stuck
at home by yourself all day.

233
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.800
so got to have something to do. OK.

234
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.400
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

235
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.000
Uh. hi. I think I left the speaker.

236
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.760
The bastards wanna charge me
200 bucks for what's like a...

237
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.080
50-dollar speaker. so...

238
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.040
Do you mind if I...?
No. come in.

239
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.080
Thanks.

240
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.000
Nah. I was a shit stripper.

241
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.120
Didn't even make it past my trial
week. I thought you were great.

242
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.000
You don't recognise me. do you?
From the moving company.

243
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.040
You're from 'Please To Move You'?

244
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.120
Well. no. not anymore.
No. Now we're folding.

245
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.480
So that's two jobs
I've lost in one week.

246
00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.640
But I read the file.
That's not necessary.

247
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.680
There are things you can do
to turn that around.

248
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.000
Well. tell that to the dickheads
who decided we're not worth saving.

249
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.080
Oh. sorry.

250
00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.120
Ah!

251
00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.200
Ah.

252
00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.560
200 bucks right there - that's...

253
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.880
What I could - I mean.
have you thought about

254
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.040
doing other work?
Yeah.

255
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.280
Cleaning?
Cleaning?

256
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.320
No. I can't.

257
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.360
Ah. so you'll take your clothes off
for strangers.

258
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.560
but God forbid if you have
to clean a woman's house.

259
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.480
I've just got to get back and help
fix the truck so they can sell it.

260
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.280
Ah. Yeah. I'm not the only one out of
work. You know. there's four of us.

261
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.680
Ah.
But thanks.

262
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.200
House cleaners?
I've never cleaned a house before.

263
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.760
It's gross.
Possibly shirtless cleaning.

264
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.720
If-if that's what the clients want.

265
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.840
Uh. I don't think that's gonna
work out so well for all of us.

266
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.040
What about the removals?
Oh. we'll do them.

267
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.640
Just if you don't get enough
removals bookings.

268
00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.960
you'll have to clean.

269
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.040
And what about the shirt business?

270
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.040
Optional extra. billable.

271
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.560
Tom. what do you have to say about
your experience as a stripper?

272
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.600
Mate. you stripped?

273
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.680
Yeah. I only did it
for a little bit.

274
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.120
Did you feel exploited?
I loved it.

275
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.640
(LAUGHING) You must have
been pretty shit.

276
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.960
Fuck off. I was all right.
(LAUGHS) (LAUGHS)

277
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.040
How do you know about him
being a stripper?

278
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.080
Oh. er. my friends

279
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.240
booked him as a surprise...

280
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.320
surprise. uh. present.

281
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.520
I just think there are a lot of women
who really like the thought of a man

282
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.480
cleaning their house.
shirtless on request.

283
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.600
And I think they'll pay for it.

284
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.720
Is that all right with everyone?

285
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.200
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Gina.

286
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.720
I would like to make an offer
on the removals company

287
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.480
'Pleased To Move You'.
We closed them down.

288
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.520
We do offer counselling.
you know that.

289
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.680
You didn't close them. I did.

290
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.720
Only. um. I didn't. (LAUGHS)

291
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.800
I decided they qualify
for business recovery.

292
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.840
Gina. that place is history.

293
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.000
And you can smell it on them
and the manager's like... 50.

294
00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.240
I can't give you a company. Yes.
you can if it's not worth anything.

295
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.360
Hm. it's not that it's
worth nothing.

296
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.320
The company has assets - you know.
client base. corporate knowledge.

297
00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.320
Truck. if I recall.
But I don't have any money yet.

298
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.360
Not on my own.

299
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.880
The creditors need 10% of assets

300
00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.520
so if you can find a way
to come up with that.

301
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.600
it could be yours.

302
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.680
Could I pay in instalments?

303
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.520
I'd need a commission.

304
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.680
Gina. that is so brave.

305
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.720
True god.

306
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.720
You frickin' nailed it.
Where'd you find your cleaners?

307
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.440
Actually it's the. uh. stripper

308
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.480
you got me for my birthday.

309
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.240
The one with the four-pack?
The very same.

310
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.280
(CHUCKLES)

311
00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.120
Hm. You still here?

312
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.080
Brett let me go.

313
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.240
There was a restructure. He had to.

314
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.160
Were you the only one?
Yep.

315
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.200
That's not a restructure.

316
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.880
That's age discrimination. That's
a problem. We can pursue that.

317
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.800
I wouldn't worry about it.
I'm setting up a different business.

318
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.280
What kind of business?

319
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.480
Removals.
Removals?

320
00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.720
(CHUCKLES) Gina. do you know
what you're getting into?

321
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.760
It's fine. We already have the -

322
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.480
Is this some kind of scheme? Cos you
know this pyramid selling business -

323
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.440
some of them are just a scam.
It's perfectly fine.

324
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.200
I'm just helping them diversify
their service base.

325
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.280
Into what? What?
What?

326
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.920
Listen. it's the first day
and I'm-I'm-I'm late.

327
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.280
Yeah. just gotta. mm. run.

328
00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.040
You remember how to clean
with a microfibre?

329
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.480
S shape.
What's a microfibre again?

330
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.760
OK. just ask her how she'd
like her house cleaned.

331
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.800
I'm sure she'll tell you.

332
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.200
Can I ask you. what did you
like when I was cleaning?

333
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.240
Cos I didn't know what
I was doing. so...

334
00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.280
any pointers would be great.
Uh...

335
00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.360
Well. you were good at
the skirting boards.

336
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.560
No. no. like...

337
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.960
what did you like?
Oh!

338
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.000
Er. do you remember what you did
with your shirt?

339
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.640
I took it off.
Yeah. And?

340
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.680
You put it in your back pocket.

341
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.720
Yeah. you could maybe try that again.
Oh.

342
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.840
Um. and. you know. leave it there.

343
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.920
Yeah. no problem.

344
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.480
Should I do the introductions for
you? No. no. no. I've got it.

345
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.760
I've got it. Yeah. I'm just

(SNORING)

525
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.520
Um. so I've been thinking.

526
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.960
And...

527
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.600
You see. I'm just not exactly sure

528
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.000
that I can reliably say that I know

529
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.520
how to please... a woman.

530
00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.800
Well...

531
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.000
if you can say that...

532
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.280
..you're a better man than most.

533
00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.680
Good.

534
00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.160
What. Anthony? So-So he's big.

535
00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.640
A jackhammer?

536
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.560
Oh. Oh. I am...

537
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.600
very sorry.

538
00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.200
Yes. of course.
I completely understand.

539
00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.600
Can we make it up to you in some way?
(I wasn't that bad.)

540
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.000
Very sorry once again.
Back to cleaning and removals. bro.

541
00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.520
On my hot mother. I swear.

Really? Oh. that's just basic.

545
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.600
What else did he miss?
Dude.

546
00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.640
Oh. he'll be back.

547
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.080
I understand. No charge.

548
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.160
Come on. fellas. Don't feel bad.
We all make mistakes.

549
00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.280
Let's look at the positives here.

550
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.320
At least you're both in the shit.

551
00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.520

you're gonna sack them.

Oh. God. God's gift.

558
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.680
Yeah. he needs help from someone
who knows more than him.

559
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.760
Someone very...

560
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.840

Just be cool.

564
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.320

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

566
00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.600
Could you teach him
to clean everything?

567
00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.720
Nothing sexy. Just-just cleaning.

568
00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.600
Everything.
Thoroughly.

569
00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.680
Uh. because I am chairing
a board meeting at three.

570
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.200
Oh. yeah.
He will so be done by then.

571
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.000
It's just your place -
it's the perfect training ground.

572
00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.080
Mm. OK.

573
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.400
Keep your clothes on.

574
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.160
Are you sure it will be good?
The cleaning?

575
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.200
The sex.

576
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.440
Of course.

577
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.560
What if he doesn't like me?

578
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.480
Why do you think he would like you?

579
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.080
It's been a little while
since I've. um...

Ah.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.120
Now like quite a few years.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.600

Can we just stop?
Stop. OK.

587
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.800
Did you learn everything you know
from watching porn?

588
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.960
Porn is the exact opposite of what
good sex feels like for women.

589
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.880
Has no one ever told you that?
No.

590
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.040
Oh. God.
Um...

591
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.160
Uh. you just tell me
what I'm doing wrong

592
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.200
and I will listen.

593
00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.320
You don't just listen
with your ears.

594
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.360
You listen with your body.

595
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.600
Now. every woman's body
is different.

596
00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.680
So even if I teach you a technique.

597
00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.800
you still have to listen each time.
Mm.

598
00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.200
What do you have to do
every single time?

599
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.560
Have to. um. listen

600
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.680
to your body with my body.

601
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.760
So I'm pretty successful at work.

602
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.880
in pretty much everything in life.

603
00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.600
except one thing.
Let me guess.

604
00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.840
Yeah. well. let's just say that

605
00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.560
not all of my sexual experiences

606
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.600
have been enjoyable.

607
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.720
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

608
00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.760
No. I've thought about it a lot.

609
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.040
I don't want a relationship
and I don't like the idea

610
00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.920
of an online hook-up.
and I've realised that

611
00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.920
I don't wanna give up on sex
forever. so... (CHUCKLES)

612
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.560
Well. you can take it gently.
You could. like. start with...

613
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.960
..a foot rub. and then move
onto a little massage.

614
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.560
and then just see if you want
to take it any further.

615
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.960
Can we do that?
Sure.

616
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.160
Glass of wine?
W-What do you like to drink?

617
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.600
Gin. I might have to
slam a few first

618
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.720
to forget myself to get started.

619
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.280
You know. I think you are
here to remember yourself.

620
00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.520
Yeah. Thanks.

621
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.520
You know what?

622
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.560
Yeah. I'll just do it.

623
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.600
Oh.

624
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.480
Not very good at letting other
people do things for you. are you?

625
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.560
Er. we need a different cloth.

626
00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.920
Yep. I'll get it.
No. no. it's fine.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.920
What does your husband do?

628
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.520
Er. did you mean to ask
what do I do?

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.560
I'm a corporate lawyer.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.800
He used to be.

633
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.840
I'm sorry. I didn't realise
he's not around.

634
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.760
Oh. no. no. no. He is around.
It's just that we don't...

635
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.880

..you know. kind of...

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.640
Yeah. Yeah.

639
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.760
It's OK.
The same with my girlfriend.

640
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.040
or my ex. We stopped. as well.

641
00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.360
Was that just because
it wasn't very good?

642
00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.840
Oh. no. no. it was great.
But it was always up to me.

643
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.280
I always had to initiate.
The thing is. um...

644
00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.040
Well. we are having a baby.

645
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.080

Yeah.

without me.

Oh.

648
00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.120
Yeah.

649
00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.560
Yeah. I wish she'd let me
be the dad. I am the dad.

650
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.600
I just really wanna be the dad.

651
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.640
I think I have to grow up a bit.

652
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.800
I need to get my shit together.

653
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
I'm sure you will.

654
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.040
You'll get there.
Yeah.

655
00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.840

I don't want ordinary orgasm.

656

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.680
then back off.

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.240
You're terrible for you.

684

I'm really not sure
I'm cut out for this.

685
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.760
Close your eyes.

That's silly.
No. no. trust me.

688
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Just close your eyes

689
00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.400
and imagine you're a woman about
to contact this business.

690
00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.600
Come on. come on.
All right.

691

Mm-hm. ..and you're intrigued.

Can't help it.

I look it up...
