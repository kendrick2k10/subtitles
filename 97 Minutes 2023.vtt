3
00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:01.747
Oceanic 420. heavy.

4
00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:04.458
Any PIREPS on the
headwinds coming in?

5
00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:12.549
Roger that.

6
00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.093
97 minutes fuel time remaining.

7
00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:25.312
Ladies and gentlemen. this
is your captain speaking.

8
00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:27.231
Hope you've been enjoying
the flight up 'til now

9
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.358
and managed to get a
little bit of sleep

10
00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:31.151
on this red eye to New York.

11
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.778
We've got a slight headwind.

12
00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:35.322
which has really affected
our arrival time.

13
00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:36.907
Our wonderful flight attendants

14
00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:39.368
are doing one last
round of refreshments.

15
00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:42.955
and make sure you enjoy the
tail end of this flight.

16
00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:44.873
New York is a brisk 65.

17
00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:47.000
and if you look out
the windows as we land

18
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.044
in a little over
an hour and a half

19
00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:51.296
you'll see the sun
rising over Manhattan.

20
00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:53.465
Sit back. enjoy the ride.

21
00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.467
The turbulence
should be minimal.

22
00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.348
He's got a gun!

23
00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:44.641
He's got a gun!

24
00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:48.395
Air marshal!

25
00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:58.530
Just calm down.

26
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.324
Nobody has to get hurt.

27
00:04:31.647 --> 00:04:32.940
What happened?

28
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.690
Get up!

29
00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:47.412
Get him outta here. come on!

30
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.501
Come on.

31
00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:28.537
Yes.

32
00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:31.164
Chief. you better
come out here.

33
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:41.592
Flight 420 and 30. last
track two niner five.

34
00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:43.427
Copy that.

35
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.931
Steak-knife. come in.

36
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.517
Steak-knife. please respond.

37
00:05:51.602 --> 00:05:52.769
Steak-knife. do you copy?

38
00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.646
- Over.
- Sit rep?

39
00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:57.399
Our 767 out of Heathrow
just pinged gold. chief.

40
00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.817
Transponders still tracking?

41
00:05:58.817 --> 00:05:59.776
Switched off.

42
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.028
Radar track only.

43
00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:02.404
And our assets?

44
00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:03.655
No contact yet.

45
00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.699
Do we know their current fuel?

46
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.660
77 minutes of
current reserves.

47
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.246
Course 295. course 295.

48
00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:11.997
Copy?

49
00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:14.791
Toyin.

50
00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:15.959
Look sharp.

51
00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.170
The director's on his way now.

52
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.713
How did he look?

53
00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:20.464
Pissed.

54
00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:23.759
What?

55
00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.385
The tin man's here.

56
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:28.222
Great.

57
00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:39.399
Director Hawkins. I-

58
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.984
Tell me about the bird. Toyin.

59
00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:43.695
Oceanic Flight 420.
out of Heathrow to JFK.

60
00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:47.533
dropped off the transponder
network at 04:11 hours.

61
00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:50.035
Confirmed multiple
armed hostiles on board.

62
00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.370
What about the failsafe?

63
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.788
Disengaged locally.

64
00:06:52.788 --> 00:06:53.872
How
was it disengaged?

65
00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.415
We're not sure.

66
00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.417
Could have been damaged
during the takeover.

67
00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.503
or they figured out
how to disarm it.

68
00:06:59.503 --> 00:07:01.755
Without the failsafe.
auto pilot won't be able

69
00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:04.132
to realign the airplane
to a safe airport.

70
00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:06.844
So they can't
fly it and we can't fly it.

71
00:07:06.844 --> 00:07:09.847
No. the plane's
gonna crash. sir.

72
00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:11.265
Do we know how many hijackers?

73
00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:12.641
Five.

74
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:13.976
Have we made
contact with them?

75
00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:15.477
Do they have any demands?

76
00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.062
Not with the hijackers. no.

77
00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:19.314
but we've been getting
intermittent signals

78
00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.275
from our asset on board.

79
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:23.235
What asset?

80
00:07:45.841 --> 00:07:47.342
Come in.

81
00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:49.428
Steak-knife. can you copy?

82
00:08:22.753 --> 00:08:23.504
Shut up!

83
00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.485
Have you seen my dad?

84
00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:47.694
You're what?

85
00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:49.655
How the hell would I know?

86
00:08:49.655 --> 00:08:51.740
He's flying the plane.

87
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.866
Son...

88
00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:54.493
Dad?

89
00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:58.038
Dad!

90
00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:00.290
Help him. please!

91
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.375
Shit...

92
00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:03.001
Hey. stop doing that. kid.

93
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.127
Stop. stop that.

94
00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.714
I need a med kit.

95
00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.049
Economy.

96
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.217
In the back.

97
00:09:10.217 --> 00:09:11.134
Economy.

98
00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.344
In the back.

99
00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.304
What's he saying?
Dad.

100
00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.265
- What's your name?
- Samuel.

101
00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:17.975
Give me your hand.

102
00:09:17.975 --> 00:09:20.227
I need you to hold pressure
on your dad's neck here.

103
00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:22.563
Use both your hands.

104
00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:25.732
I'm gonna go find a med kit.

105
00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.943
Listen. don't let go. okay?

106
00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:22.289
Shit.

107
00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:25.375
Come in.

108
00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:26.335
Steak-knife.

109
00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:36.803
What are you looking for?

110
00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:37.721
Med kit.

111
00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.389
Pilot's been shot.

112
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.892
Can I help you?

113
00:10:41.892 --> 00:10:42.643
Shut up!

114
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:49.316
Find me someone. a
nurse. a doctor. anyone.

115
00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:50.609
Okay. go before they see you.

116
00:10:50.609 --> 00:10:53.362
I'll come and find you.

117
00:10:53.362 --> 00:10:55.531
We need someone
with medical training.

118
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:56.823
Medical training.

119
00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.200
Anybody with medical training?

120
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.701
A nurse. doctor...

121
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.621
My God. I think
someone's been shot.

122
00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:04.998
They need a doctor.

123
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.333
A nurse. doctor?

124
00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:11.839
Please.

125
00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:13.257
He's one of them.

126
00:11:15.217 --> 00:11:15.926
Please.

127
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.389
Nobody move!

128
00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:32.150
Who is this asset?

129
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.861
Deep cover operative.

130
00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:36.238
Works with our friends
across the pond.

131
00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:39.533
Implanted with the transnational
extremist cell in Ukraine

132
00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:40.784
late last year.

133
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.412
Russian separatists.

134
00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:45.414
We don't know
their agenda yet.

135
00:11:45.414 --> 00:11:48.417
It seems we don't know
much of anything. do we?

136
00:11:48.417 --> 00:11:51.044
Well. we have a very weak
signal via satellite comm relay.

137
00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.671
Miniaturized
earpiece from DARPA.

138
00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.548
Why didn't our asset warn us?

139
00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:57.259
With all the intel we've been
getting on detainees lately.

140
00:11:57.259 --> 00:11:59.970
the current SOP
for these guys is.

141
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.805
don't tell your people the plan

142
00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.974
until it's time for
them to know the plan.

143
00:12:03.974 --> 00:12:05.225
Best guess is--

144
00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:06.643
I don't want guesses. Toyin.

145
00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:08.145
I need intel.

146
00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:09.980
Play the last transmission.

147
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.523
This is Steak-Knife.

148
00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:13.066
We have a hijack situation.

149
00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.401
Is Naznas waiting?

150
00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.361
I repeat. is Naznas waiting?

151
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:17.905
Naznas.

152
00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:20.490
CIA picked that up
on their chatter too.

153
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.783
All right. first
order of business.

154
00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.327
ID the hijackers.

155
00:12:23.327 --> 00:12:24.870
Get on the horn with
the asset's handler.

156
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.955
find out everything you
can about the embed.

157
00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:29.374
Track every ground
and airline employee

158
00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.503
with access to that plane
to the last three ports.

159
00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:34.963
Second. we need
eyeballs on that plane.

160
00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.590
AWACS diverted onstation

161
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.801
and F-22's ready for a
Code Orange scramble.

162
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.513
I don't know who's that was.
but that's my office now.

163
00:12:42.513 --> 00:12:45.516
I need a secure line to the
White House. and a coffee.

164
00:12:45.516 --> 00:12:46.892
Black. no sugar.

165
00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.771
Director Hawkins.

166
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:53.190
You're initiating a Code Orange?

167
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.025
On whose authority?

168
00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.653
I think I just mentioned
the White House. didn't I?

169
00:12:57.653 --> 00:12:59.613
Sir. we have a
man on the inside.

170
00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:01.114
If we just give him time...

171
00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.616
Your comm link is down.

172
00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:04.493
Your asset is in
way over his head.

173
00:13:04.493 --> 00:13:07.746
You've got five armed
hostiles in control of a 767.

174
00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:10.290
I would say that our
opportunity vanished

175
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.417
the moment that
failsafe was disabled.

176
00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.169
But this can't
be our first play.

177
00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:16.755
This is not the beginning
of some heroic story.

178
00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:19.424
In 10 minutes. our birds
will be in the air.

179
00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.968
and 20 minutes after that.

180
00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:23.053
they'll be in the
position to end this.

181
00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:25.639
And some innocent
people are going to die

182
00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:28.141
so that more innocent
people will live.

183
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:48.537
RAD 21. please
confirm we are firing

184
00:13:48.537 --> 00:13:50.914
at passenger aircraft on sight.

185
00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:52.749
Confirmed. RAD 21.

186
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:56.378
Rules of engagement are
FOS and weapons free.

187
00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:58.964
Locate and destroy flight.

188
00:13:58.964 --> 00:14:00.716
Copy that.

189
00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:09.474
Sam. move to the inside.

190
00:14:17.316 --> 00:14:19.067
I found us a doctor.

191
00:14:20.152 --> 00:14:22.738
They didn't see us leave.

192
00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:44.134
I saw three of
them down there.

193
00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.094
I saw two in the front.

194
00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:47.596
Is he gonna be okay?

195
00:14:47.596 --> 00:14:49.556
He's gonna be fine. Sam.

196
00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:52.518
Put your hand on this.

197
00:14:52.518 --> 00:14:54.061
Just get 'em round his side or
else we got a problem. okay?

198
00:14:54.061 --> 00:14:56.188
I'll get some some water.

199
00:14:56.188 --> 00:14:57.523
Allow me.

200
00:14:57.523 --> 00:14:59.483
I bandaged many
wounds in the war.

201
00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:04.780
Keep him alive.

202
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.073
We'll need him.

203
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:01.670
If he stops
breathing. call me.

204
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.630
Only me.

205
00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:19.021
Steak-knife.

206
00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:20.439
Steak-knife. do you copy?

207
00:16:20.439 --> 00:16:22.691
Steak-knife. come in.

208
00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:23.859
Respond. please.

209
00:16:23.859 --> 00:16:25.485
We're running out of time.

210
00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:26.987
We need that link-up.

211
00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:28.447
I tried
every keyhole in range.

212
00:16:28.447 --> 00:16:29.865
He might be receiving.
he might not.

213
00:16:29.865 --> 00:16:30.991
What about the failsafe?

214
00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:32.618
Is there some way to re engage?

215
00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:34.286
Not if it's
a hardware issue. no.

216
00:16:34.286 --> 00:16:35.913
Okay.
Here we go.

217
00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:38.373
Okay. yes.

218
00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:40.083
What is it?

219
00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.627
I have a friend at the CIA

220
00:16:41.627 --> 00:16:43.295
who's been tracking all
this Naznas chatter.

221
00:16:43.295 --> 00:16:45.589
He found a thread on
the Ukrainian dark web.

222
00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:47.257
- This is bad.
- What?

223
00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:50.886
Naznas is a code for a
mass extermination event.

224
00:16:50.886 --> 00:16:53.680
This is some end of
days type shit here.

225
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.641
I mean. if our hijackers
were actually messing around

226
00:16:55.641 --> 00:16:57.935
with something they're
calling Naznas.

227
00:16:57.935 --> 00:17:00.229
well. then. this is more
than just a hijacking.

228
00:17:00.229 --> 00:17:03.023
This whole thing is gonna
get a hell of a lot worse.

229
00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:05.484
Let's not let it get worse.

230
00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:12.366
What the fuck. Orca?

231
00:17:12.366 --> 00:17:14.618
You shot all the attendants.

232
00:17:14.618 --> 00:17:16.620
You could have brought
the plane down.

233
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.997
Do not fire your weapon again.

234
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:23.460
I take orders from
God. not from you.

235
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.503
You don't like it?

236
00:17:24.503 --> 00:17:25.879
Get off my plane.

237
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.342
You're fucking weak.

238
00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.139
You keep an eye on him.

239
00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:36.890
Agreed.

240
00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:46.108
Let's go.

241
00:17:46.108 --> 00:17:47.985
Who was that woman
with the pilot?

242
00:17:47.985 --> 00:17:48.986
She's a doctor.

243
00:17:48.986 --> 00:17:51.113
She's keeping him alive.

244
00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:52.197
You don't have control.

245
00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:53.699
Don't worry about that.

246
00:17:53.699 --> 00:17:55.200
You just keep an eye
on the passengers.

247
00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:59.246
Phone.

248
00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:00.414
Goran was supposed
to collect the phones!

249
00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:01.832
Whose fucking phone is it?

250
00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:04.126
Show me your phone.

251
00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:06.378
Give him your phones!

252
00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.213
Give him your phones!

253
00:18:17.973 --> 00:18:20.017
Give me the phone.

254
00:18:23.312 --> 00:18:25.063
Give me the phone.

255
00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:34.990
Good boy.

256
00:18:38.285 --> 00:18:40.245
What's going on?

257
00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:42.873
Shut the fuck up.

258
00:18:42.873 --> 00:18:44.124
Keep walking.

259
00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.334
Where are you taking me?

260
00:18:45.334 --> 00:18:46.335
Shut up.

261
00:18:46.335 --> 00:18:47.419
No. no no no!

262
00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:49.087
Shut the fuck up!

263
00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:52.049
No. no. no. no. no.

264
00:18:52.049 --> 00:18:53.133
Shut up!

265
00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:54.593
Do you know what this is?

266
00:18:54.593 --> 00:18:56.553
This is satellite communications.

267
00:18:56.553 --> 00:19:01.225
Do terrorists have satellites.
or do states have satellites?

268
00:19:01.225 --> 00:19:03.852
So what the fuck are you?

269
00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.187
I'm Interpol.

270
00:19:05.187 --> 00:19:06.772
What. like. undercover?

271
00:19:06.772 --> 00:19:08.857
Yeah. like. undercover.

272
00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:11.527
Oh. you're full of shit.

273
00:19:11.527 --> 00:19:13.195
Really?

274
00:19:13.362 --> 00:19:17.241
Then why haven't I put a bullet
in your fucking head yet?

275
00:19:24.665 --> 00:19:27.334
We need to involve
the other passengers.

276
00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:29.336
You do not blow my cover.

277
00:19:30.838 --> 00:19:32.047
You just did.

278
00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:33.507
You're one person.

279
00:19:33.507 --> 00:19:35.425
The more people know.

280
00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:38.220
the more likely the
hijackers will know.

281
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.183
So. for both our fucking
sakes. keep it shut.

282
00:20:20.012 --> 00:20:21.763
I could use your help.

283
00:20:31.982 --> 00:20:33.442
Goran!

284
00:20:33.442 --> 00:20:34.985
Move!

285
00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:15.317
What is that?

286
00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:18.195
Nothing.

287
00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:19.905
It belonged to my son.

288
00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:22.115
Shrapnel?

289
00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:22.824
Yeah.

290
00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.913
How old was your son?

291
00:21:30.207 --> 00:21:32.501
We need to get to the pilot.

292
00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:35.379
Come on.

293
00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.842
What is that?

294
00:21:39.842 --> 00:21:40.968
Surveillance footage
of the flight maintenance

295
00:21:40.968 --> 00:21:42.594
on a fuel stop in Qatar.

296
00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:43.554
I have a friend there.

297
00:21:43.554 --> 00:21:44.847
Anything?

298
00:21:44.847 --> 00:21:46.139
Where's the Heathrow footage?

299
00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:47.474
Server crashed. sir.

300
00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:48.851
Before or after takeoff?

301
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:50.394
20 minutes before.

302
00:21:50.394 --> 00:21:51.436
Tell me you don't
believe in coincidence.

303
00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:52.396
No. sir.

304
00:21:52.396 --> 00:21:54.147
Give me more. please.

305
00:22:23.302 --> 00:22:24.511
Fucking animal.

306
00:22:29.266 --> 00:22:30.976
Hey. you doing okay?

307
00:22:30.976 --> 00:22:32.311
Please stand back.

308
00:22:32.311 --> 00:22:33.896
Hey. I need you to
get me blankets.

309
00:22:33.896 --> 00:22:35.522
towels. anything we can
use as bandages. okay?

310
00:22:35.522 --> 00:22:36.481
Go.

311
00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:38.442
All right.

312
00:22:38.442 --> 00:22:39.902
Okay. Sammy. I'm gonna take
care of your daddy. all right?

313
00:22:39.902 --> 00:22:41.612
I need you to stay
really calm. okay?

314
00:22:41.612 --> 00:22:43.363
He's an undercover agent.

315
00:22:43.363 --> 00:22:45.282
He's gonna help us.
all right. sweetie?

316
00:22:45.282 --> 00:22:46.408
He's gonna save us.

317
00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:47.576
Don't you worry. okay?

318
00:22:47.576 --> 00:22:48.493
You stay calm.

319
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.830
Hey. I got these.

320
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:52.831
Okay.

321
00:22:52.831 --> 00:22:54.249
I told him about you.

322
00:22:54.249 --> 00:22:55.751
After I specifically
told you not to?

323
00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:57.377
Yeah.

324
00:22:57.377 --> 00:22:59.296
But we need the other
passengers. all right?

325
00:22:59.296 --> 00:23:01.006
Tell me this.

326
00:23:01.006 --> 00:23:03.133
When the doctor told you
that smoking causes cancer.

327
00:23:03.133 --> 00:23:04.676
did you start straight away

328
00:23:04.676 --> 00:23:06.220
or did you give it a
fucking day or two?

329
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.679
I don't understand.

330
00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:09.223
The more people
know my identity.

331
00:23:09.223 --> 00:23:10.891
the worse it is for
your fucking health.

332
00:23:10.891 --> 00:23:13.352
Everything okay over there?

333
00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:17.105
Yeah. we're good.

334
00:23:17.105 --> 00:23:18.440
Aren't we good?

335
00:23:23.654 --> 00:23:25.405
Do your fucking job.

336
00:23:42.548 --> 00:23:44.049
Are you okay?

337
00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:44.800
Huh?

338
00:23:47.135 --> 00:23:48.554
Oh!

339
00:23:48.554 --> 00:23:49.930
Oh. yeah. yeah.

340
00:24:02.734 --> 00:24:05.654
How long have you
been a terrorist?

341
00:24:07.114 --> 00:24:08.782
You know what. Sam?

342
00:24:08.782 --> 00:24:12.828
I don't really consider
myself a terrorist.

343
00:24:12.828 --> 00:24:14.997
Then what are you?

344
00:24:16.748 --> 00:24:19.543
I'm just a man who's
about to get your father

345
00:24:19.543 --> 00:24:20.794
a glass of water.

346
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:20.771
Shit.

347
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:31.782
We're flying too high. too fast.

348
00:25:37.913 --> 00:25:39.081
Anan.

349
00:25:39.081 --> 00:25:40.290
What's happening?

350
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.334
Where's the altimeter?

351
00:25:42.334 --> 00:25:43.126
30.000.

352
00:25:43.126 --> 00:25:44.920
It's steady.

353
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.338
It's not rising.

354
00:25:46.338 --> 00:25:48.048
No. we're level.

355
00:25:48.048 --> 00:25:49.842
Cabin pressure.

356
00:25:49.842 --> 00:25:51.009
15 psi.

357
00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:52.386
We're over pressured.

358
00:25:52.386 --> 00:25:54.221
Normally. it's nine.
nine and a half.

359
00:25:54.221 --> 00:25:58.517
Goran's gun may have
punctured the fuselage.

360
00:25:58.517 --> 00:25:59.977
There's gotta be a problem

361
00:25:59.977 --> 00:26:01.812
with the cabin
pressurization system.

362
00:26:01.812 --> 00:26:03.146
It's rising.

363
00:26:03.146 --> 00:26:06.066
Past 17. the hull could rupture.

364
00:26:06.066 --> 00:26:08.819
How much time do I have?

365
00:26:08.819 --> 00:26:09.987
Five minutes.

366
00:26:09.987 --> 00:26:10.737
Shit.

367
00:26:16.034 --> 00:26:16.910
Hey.

368
00:26:17.995 --> 00:26:19.079
Wake him up.

369
00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:20.289
No. he's still unstable.

370
00:26:20.289 --> 00:26:21.957
Hey!

371
00:26:21.957 --> 00:26:22.875
I need the pilot to help
me fix the cabin pressure.

372
00:26:22.875 --> 00:26:24.459
He'll die.

373
00:26:24.459 --> 00:26:26.628
If you don't wake
him up. we'll all die.

374
00:26:26.628 --> 00:26:29.339
No. everything I've done
up until now is just basic.

375
00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:31.633
I can't be responsible for...

376
00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:32.718
Hey!

377
00:26:32.718 --> 00:26:34.803
You're not responsible.

378
00:26:34.803 --> 00:26:36.680
You didn't shoot him.

379
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.639
Wake him up.

380
00:26:41.101 --> 00:26:42.936
It's gonna be okay. Sam.

381
00:26:44.438 --> 00:26:45.689
Hey.

382
00:26:45.689 --> 00:26:46.440
Sam...

383
00:26:49.193 --> 00:26:51.195
Where's your EpiPen. Sam?

384
00:26:51.195 --> 00:26:53.071
In the back.

385
00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:54.364
Meds. meds.

386
00:26:54.364 --> 00:26:55.782
Go get all the meds.

387
00:26:55.782 --> 00:26:56.533
Marko!

388
00:26:59.494 --> 00:27:01.079
Everybody. listen up.

389
00:27:01.079 --> 00:27:04.291
I need your medication now.

390
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.088
We need meds.

391
00:27:10.088 --> 00:27:13.634
Asthma inhalers. EpiPens.
anything you've got.

392
00:27:15.177 --> 00:27:17.554
Come on. come on. come on!

393
00:27:29.316 --> 00:27:30.067
Okay.

394
00:27:41.787 --> 00:27:45.332
Hey. this is
everything they got.

395
00:27:52.047 --> 00:27:52.798
17 psi.

396
00:27:55.342 --> 00:27:56.093
Hey.

397
00:27:57.219 --> 00:27:59.680
Slow is smooth. smooth is fast.

398
00:28:00.722 --> 00:28:02.266
Too little Epi. he stays out.

399
00:28:02.266 --> 00:28:03.892
Too much. he codes.

400
00:28:03.892 --> 00:28:04.643
Relax.

401
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.242
That's two.

402
00:28:20.242 --> 00:28:21.660
Nothing's happening.

403
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.619
That's not enough.

404
00:28:22.619 --> 00:28:23.412
Just wait.

405
00:28:23.412 --> 00:28:24.580
He needs more.

406
00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.999
He could stroke out.

407
00:28:26.999 --> 00:28:27.749
Do it.

408
00:28:29.126 --> 00:28:30.669
No. wait. Please.

409
00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:33.005
Hey. Sam. Sam. look
at me. look at me!

410
00:28:33.005 --> 00:28:35.382
You've gotta trust her
to do her job right now.

411
00:28:35.382 --> 00:28:36.383
Okay?

412
00:28:36.383 --> 00:28:37.718
17.4 psi.

413
00:28:45.851 --> 00:28:46.602
Do it.

414
00:28:52.357 --> 00:28:53.942
17.6!

415
00:28:53.942 --> 00:28:55.485
Do it!

416
00:28:55.485 --> 00:28:56.236
Now!

417
00:28:59.156 --> 00:29:00.407
What's happening?

418
00:29:00.407 --> 00:29:01.491
Where am I?

419
00:29:01.491 --> 00:29:02.576
Hey. hey.

420
00:29:02.576 --> 00:29:04.286
The plane's been hijacked.

421
00:29:04.286 --> 00:29:06.496
A bullet has pierced
the hull somewhere.

422
00:29:06.496 --> 00:29:09.791
We're losing cabin pressure
and we're at 17 psi.

423
00:29:09.791 --> 00:29:11.919
How do I fix it?

424
00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:15.506
The valve must
be stuck in manual.

425
00:29:15.506 --> 00:29:17.549
Flip it to automatic.

426
00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:20.594
That will help
regulate the pressure.

427
00:29:22.179 --> 00:29:24.431
Where is the valve?

428
00:29:24.431 --> 00:29:25.265
Captain!

429
00:29:26.391 --> 00:29:27.351
What's happening?

430
00:29:27.351 --> 00:29:28.477
Inject him again.

431
00:29:28.477 --> 00:29:29.478
No. he'll stroke.

432
00:29:29.478 --> 00:29:30.979
We are out of time!

433
00:29:38.028 --> 00:29:42.449
Row seventeen. red
valve. blue conduit.

434
00:29:42.449 --> 00:29:43.492
Got it.

435
00:29:43.492 --> 00:29:45.494
Save my boy. please.

436
00:29:45.494 --> 00:29:46.578
Save my boy.

437
00:29:55.921 --> 00:29:56.672
17.8.

438
00:30:19.069 --> 00:30:19.820
17.9!

439
00:30:30.247 --> 00:30:30.998
18!

440
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.430
17.8.

441
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:47.764
16.

442
00:30:47.764 --> 00:30:49.016
14 and falling.

443
00:31:09.494 --> 00:31:10.662
You killed him.

444
00:31:11.622 --> 00:31:13.540
You killed him. you killed him.

445
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.875
you killed him. you killed him!

446
00:31:14.875 --> 00:31:16.126
Hey.

447
00:31:55.082 --> 00:31:55.916
Sit down!

448
00:32:11.473 --> 00:32:12.224
Alex?

449
00:32:16.353 --> 00:32:18.605
You did everything you could.

450
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.778
Let me see your hand.

451
00:32:24.778 --> 00:32:25.863
I'm good.

452
00:32:25.863 --> 00:32:27.614
Just give me your hand.

453
00:32:36.498 --> 00:32:38.709
You're wrong. you know.

454
00:32:38.709 --> 00:32:39.459
Am I?

455
00:32:40.961 --> 00:32:42.629
I quit everything.

456
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:46.008
I quit my residency.

457
00:32:46.008 --> 00:32:48.552
I guess you had your reasons.

458
00:32:48.552 --> 00:32:49.303
Yeah.

459
00:32:50.137 --> 00:32:51.847
Yeah. shitty ex.

460
00:32:51.847 --> 00:32:53.932
He was a narcissist.

461
00:32:53.932 --> 00:32:56.602
Needed me to think that I
was worthless without him.

462
00:32:56.602 --> 00:32:58.353
And he was really
good. you know?

463
00:32:58.353 --> 00:33:00.814
Towards the end. I
almost did believe him.

464
00:33:00.814 --> 00:33:02.858
We fought a lot.
slept even less.

465
00:33:02.858 --> 00:33:05.903
and one day I administered
meds to a patient

466
00:33:05.903 --> 00:33:08.488
without checking their charts.

467
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:15.120
Those were meds. they'd
already been given.

468
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.289
And that's the day
that I quit my marriage

469
00:33:17.289 --> 00:33:18.707
and my residency.

470
00:33:21.043 --> 00:33:22.002
I'm sorry.

471
00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.964
Yeah. me. too.

472
00:33:31.845 --> 00:33:33.055
Seven.

473
00:33:33.055 --> 00:33:34.014
What?

474
00:33:35.641 --> 00:33:36.391
My son.

475
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.394
He was seven.

476
00:33:47.819 --> 00:33:48.695
What now?

477
00:33:49.947 --> 00:33:50.906
We wait.

478
00:33:50.906 --> 00:33:52.157
No.

479
00:33:52.324 --> 00:33:55.285
We have to take
control of the plane.

480
00:34:00.666 --> 00:34:02.209
It looks like a toy.

481
00:34:04.086 --> 00:34:07.798
Yeah. it looks like a
toy. but it's not a toy.

482
00:34:10.509 --> 00:34:12.261
It's a 3D printed gun.

483
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:14.930
basically the same
as a real one.

484
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:16.974
with a two shot capacity.

485
00:34:18.892 --> 00:34:20.394
How does it work?

486
00:34:20.394 --> 00:34:24.147
Cock the hammer.
sensitive trigger.

487
00:34:27.651 --> 00:34:28.819
No magazine?

488
00:34:33.031 --> 00:34:33.866
Magazine.

489
00:34:39.955 --> 00:34:40.873
Point.

490
00:34:42.457 --> 00:34:43.208
And shoot.

491
00:34:48.005 --> 00:34:49.089
Got it?

492
00:34:49.089 --> 00:34:49.840
Yeah.

493
00:34:51.049 --> 00:34:52.634
Come on. Remy.

494
00:34:52.634 --> 00:34:55.179
The F22s are gonna be
on them any minute!

495
00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:56.096
I'm trying.

496
00:34:56.096 --> 00:34:57.681
Try harder. man!

497
00:35:06.148 --> 00:35:08.692
Steak-knife. come in.

498
00:35:12.362 --> 00:35:14.448
Do you have your man?

499
00:35:14.448 --> 00:35:16.950
This is Steak-knife.

500
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:17.951
Yes. go on.

501
00:35:18.952 --> 00:35:20.495
The pilot's dead.

502
00:35:20.495 --> 00:35:22.915
There's no one to fly
the goddamn plane.

503
00:35:22.915 --> 00:35:25.250
What's the plan now?

504
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:27.002
What do I tell him?

505
00:35:27.002 --> 00:35:29.129
There's no way to reestablish
the failsafe control

506
00:35:29.129 --> 00:35:30.547
from the ground?

507
00:35:30.547 --> 00:35:31.507
Not if there's
mechanical damage. no.

508
00:35:31.507 --> 00:35:33.342
Well. what about him?

509
00:35:33.342 --> 00:35:34.843
Can't we transfer a packet
that he can install locally.

510
00:35:34.843 --> 00:35:35.844
or something?

511
00:35:35.844 --> 00:35:36.970
Not at 30.000 feet.

512
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.305
What's the ETA on the raptors?

513
00:35:38.305 --> 00:35:39.306
Six minutes. sir.

514
00:35:39.306 --> 00:35:40.224
Where are they now?

515
00:35:40.224 --> 00:35:41.808
Farm County. PA.

516
00:35:41.808 --> 00:35:43.227
You tell them we'll
have remote control

517
00:35:43.227 --> 00:35:45.229
of the failsafe
system in 10 minutes.

518
00:35:45.229 --> 00:35:47.105
Yes. sir.

519
00:35:47.105 --> 00:35:49.983
You want him to stand down
so the F22s can shoot him down.

520
00:35:49.983 --> 00:35:51.610
Sometimes you have
to put down your dog.

521
00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:53.111
Nobody wants to.

522
00:35:53.111 --> 00:35:54.863
But you're making
sure that happens.

523
00:35:54.863 --> 00:35:58.075
Look. if you have a
magic bullet. I'm all ears.

524
00:35:58.075 --> 00:35:58.825
If not...

525
00:36:04.248 --> 00:36:05.207
Roger.

526
00:36:05.207 --> 00:36:07.292
Roger. Steak-knife.

527
00:36:07.292 --> 00:36:09.086
Do not take any action.

528
00:36:09.086 --> 00:36:12.172
Ground control will regain
failsafe control remotely

529
00:36:12.172 --> 00:36:13.674
in 10 minutes.

530
00:36:13.674 --> 00:36:15.050
Good news?

531
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.303
Not sure yet.

532
00:36:18.303 --> 00:36:20.472
You need to find somewhere
to sit down and buckle up.

533
00:36:20.472 --> 00:36:21.223
Go on.

534
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.565
Sit the fuck down!

535
00:36:29.565 --> 00:36:30.941
Sit down. you!

536
00:36:30.941 --> 00:36:33.068
Hey. we need to do something.

537
00:36:33.068 --> 00:36:34.278
I don't know what.

538
00:36:34.278 --> 00:36:35.279
What do they want?

539
00:36:35.279 --> 00:36:36.989
I don't know.

540
00:36:36.989 --> 00:36:38.365
I say we make a stand.

541
00:36:46.999 --> 00:36:47.916
Sit. sit!

542
00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:49.084
Get the fuck down.

543
00:36:49.084 --> 00:36:50.919
You!

544
00:36:50.919 --> 00:36:53.297
Even if we overpower them.
who's gonna fly the plane?

545
00:36:53.297 --> 00:36:57.176
That lady saw the pilot
lying on the floor dead.

546
00:36:57.176 --> 00:36:59.261
We'll figure something out.

547
00:36:59.261 --> 00:37:01.263
It's time to make a move.

548
00:37:01.263 --> 00:37:03.265
Get back to your fucking seat.

549
00:37:03.265 --> 00:37:05.601
Get back to your fucking seat.

550
00:37:14.193 --> 00:37:16.320
Kim. I'm so scared.

551
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.154
Ssh.

552
00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:20.782
Okay.

553
00:37:20.782 --> 00:37:23.285
All right. I need you to
stay inside here. okay?

554
00:37:23.285 --> 00:37:24.661
Be brave.

555
00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:27.456
Don't open the door
to anyone. okay?

556
00:37:27.456 --> 00:37:29.166
Do not open for anyone.

557
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.101
Where's Goran?

558
00:37:48.101 --> 00:37:49.520
I'm not his
fucking babysitter.

559
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.938
I haven't seen him.

560
00:37:59.154 --> 00:38:01.448
Orca. pick up the phone.

561
00:38:02.616 --> 00:38:03.951
Orca. pick up.

562
00:38:05.953 --> 00:38:07.996
Is Goran back there?

563
00:38:07.996 --> 00:38:09.122
No.

564
00:38:09.122 --> 00:38:10.415
Are you alone?

565
00:38:10.415 --> 00:38:11.458
No. I'm with Leika.

566
00:38:11.458 --> 00:38:12.960
Why. what's wrong?

567
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.837
Alex is distracted
by the passengers.

568
00:38:14.837 --> 00:38:16.630
He's either losing
his way. or...

569
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:17.714
What?

570
00:38:17.714 --> 00:38:19.508
Just find Goran.

571
00:38:19.508 --> 00:38:23.303
I've told you. you
trust Alex way too much.

572
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.143
Overwatch.
it's RAD 21.

573
00:38:30.143 --> 00:38:32.187
Please confirm you're
fixed on target.

574
00:38:32.187 --> 00:38:33.689
Target is at 3-5-0.

575
00:38:33.689 --> 00:38:35.524
holding steady on
previous course.

576
00:38:35.524 --> 00:38:36.483
Copy that.

577
00:38:36.483 --> 00:38:38.360
We'll intercept at 4.5.

578
00:39:00.549 --> 00:39:02.676
We have to do something.

579
00:39:02.676 --> 00:39:04.011
Warn him.

580
00:39:04.011 --> 00:39:05.637
Yeah. but what
good will that do?

581
00:39:05.637 --> 00:39:08.932
Besides. any communication
will be monitored.

582
00:39:08.932 --> 00:39:09.725
Wait.

583
00:39:09.725 --> 00:39:10.684
What?

584
00:39:10.684 --> 00:39:11.518
Wait. wait. wait.

585
00:39:11.518 --> 00:39:12.477
Sigint.

586
00:39:12.477 --> 00:39:14.688
Signal interrupt.

587
00:39:14.688 --> 00:39:16.356
I can fire a white noise.

588
00:39:16.356 --> 00:39:18.066
then modulate the
connection to the satellite.

589
00:39:18.066 --> 00:39:19.610
On his end. it will
just cut in and out.

590
00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:20.652
Right?

591
00:39:20.652 --> 00:39:22.112
Like dots and dashes.

592
00:39:22.112 --> 00:39:23.655
Morse code.

593
00:39:23.655 --> 00:39:26.700
We could get in a hell
of a lot of trouble.

594
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.910
Do it.

595
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:28.869
All right.

596
00:39:45.719 --> 00:39:46.470
Shit.

597
00:40:46.113 --> 00:40:48.740
Rad 21
at eight-nine-niner.

598
00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:49.867
Target acquired.

599
00:40:52.286 --> 00:40:54.872
Tell him it's headed
to the starboard side.

600
00:40:54.872 --> 00:40:56.665
impact in 45 seconds.

601
00:40:56.665 --> 00:40:59.501
All right. 45 seconds.

602
00:41:19.354 --> 00:41:22.858
Sidewinder
is locked and loaded.

603
00:41:24.818 --> 00:41:26.528
On my mark.

604
00:41:26.528 --> 00:41:27.529
Two.

605
00:41:27.529 --> 00:41:28.530
One.

606
00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:29.239
Fire!

607
00:41:38.832 --> 00:41:41.168
What is it?

608
00:41:41.168 --> 00:41:42.002
What is it?

609
00:41:56.266 --> 00:41:57.684
Negative impact.

610
00:41:57.684 --> 00:41:58.435
Shit!

611
00:42:04.066 --> 00:42:06.235
Marko. come with me!

612
00:42:06.235 --> 00:42:08.278
What the fuck was that?

613
00:42:09.613 --> 00:42:11.865
What are you doing?

614
00:42:11.865 --> 00:42:14.243
Anan!

615
00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:37.850
Second strike
to launch. vector in range.

616
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:42.437
Arming A to A.

617
00:43:09.047 --> 00:43:10.924
What was that?

618
00:43:10.924 --> 00:43:12.176
Unknown. sir.

619
00:43:20.058 --> 00:43:21.894
You motherfucker.

620
00:43:21.894 --> 00:43:22.853
What is it?

621
00:43:24.062 --> 00:43:25.022
Ghosts.

622
00:43:25.022 --> 00:43:26.023
Sir. I have ghosts.

623
00:43:26.023 --> 00:43:26.982
What the hell?

624
00:43:26.982 --> 00:43:28.233
Multiple phantoms.

625
00:43:28.233 --> 00:43:29.610
Must be HBTD.

626
00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:31.612
To confirm.
A985 frequency.

627
00:43:31.612 --> 00:43:32.529
Can't be.

628
00:43:32.529 --> 00:43:33.780
That's Russian.

629
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:34.907
HBTD?

630
00:43:34.907 --> 00:43:36.575
High-band transmission device.

631
00:43:36.575 --> 00:43:39.077
Soviet bombers used them
to confuse American radar

632
00:43:39.077 --> 00:43:40.245
during the cold war.

633
00:43:40.245 --> 00:43:41.205
Radar is useless.

634
00:43:41.205 --> 00:43:42.206
We're flying blind!

635
00:43:42.206 --> 00:43:43.582
Friendly confirmed!

636
00:43:43.582 --> 00:43:45.209
Heavy out of Atlanta
in our airspace!

637
00:43:45.209 --> 00:43:46.919
Christ. we were supposed
to have clear air!

638
00:43:46.919 --> 00:43:49.505
Who gave them that
fucking clearance?

639
00:43:51.673 --> 00:43:56.345
Raptor 2 back in
formation for second launch.

640
00:44:04.228 --> 00:44:05.270
Goddamn it!

641
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:06.230
Abort!

642
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:07.773
Do what she says.

643
00:44:07.773 --> 00:44:09.399
Raptor abort!
Raptor abort!

644
00:44:09.399 --> 00:44:12.027
Negative. control.
Cannot abort.

645
00:44:25.666 --> 00:44:27.125
What the hell...

646
00:44:27.125 --> 00:44:28.669
It's gonna hit!

647
00:44:28.669 --> 00:44:29.837
I'm too close!

648
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:40.681
Hey.

649
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:56.697
That's
a direct hit. sir.

650
00:44:58.574 --> 00:44:59.783
Oh. my God!

651
00:44:59.783 --> 00:45:01.410
We're taking on debris!

652
00:45:16.508 --> 00:45:19.178
We lost the friendly.

653
00:45:19.178 --> 00:45:21.388
Raptor One. come in.

654
00:45:21.388 --> 00:45:23.265
Raptor Two. do you copy?

655
00:45:23.265 --> 00:45:25.434
Sir. we've lost both F22s.

656
00:45:27.728 --> 00:45:29.980
That's why we sent three.

657
00:45:35.402 --> 00:45:37.613
Raptor 3 engaged.

658
00:45:41.783 --> 00:45:42.576
Move!

659
00:45:42.576 --> 00:45:43.327
Move!

660
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:50.334
She's in the clear.
Missile grazed it. sir.

661
00:45:50.334 --> 00:45:52.628
All right. let's get
them back on mission.

662
00:45:52.628 --> 00:45:53.420
What?

663
00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.880
No.

664
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.757
No. you cannot go
through with this.

665
00:45:56.757 --> 00:45:59.301
We are shooting at
unarmed civilians

666
00:45:59.301 --> 00:46:01.261
in uncontrolled airspace.

667
00:46:01.261 --> 00:46:03.263
No. we're shooting
down a 200 ton missile

668
00:46:03.263 --> 00:46:05.265
that's gonna kill a lot
of unarmed civilians.

669
00:46:05.265 --> 00:46:06.850
This is war. chief.

670
00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:09.019
They started it and
we're responding.

671
00:46:09.019 --> 00:46:10.395
The order stands.

672
00:46:10.395 --> 00:46:11.855
Terminate on sight.

673
00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:22.533
What is that?

674
00:46:24.993 --> 00:46:26.995
That's an impact trigger.

675
00:46:26.995 --> 00:46:27.746
Yes.

676
00:46:29.122 --> 00:46:31.291
That's a nuclear warhead.

677
00:46:31.291 --> 00:46:33.085
What do you think
the Americans will do

678
00:46:33.085 --> 00:46:36.046
when a Russian nuclear
bomb destroys their city?

679
00:46:36.046 --> 00:46:39.216
How long will the world burn?

680
00:46:39.216 --> 00:46:43.470
You want to start a war
between the superpowers?

681
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:44.888
No. Marko.

682
00:46:44.888 --> 00:46:47.224
I want a world
without superpowers.

683
00:46:47.224 --> 00:46:51.228
What we do today is the
beginning of their end.

684
00:47:00.237 --> 00:47:02.197
Asghar. pull up
the Qatar footage.

685
00:47:02.197 --> 00:47:05.951
And have our asset there
pick up the engineer.

686
00:47:13.584 --> 00:47:14.751
Wait a minute...

687
00:47:17.546 --> 00:47:20.465
Sir. I have something
you may want to see.

688
00:47:20.465 --> 00:47:21.925
All right. look here.

689
00:47:21.925 --> 00:47:23.552
This is the kit
trolley in Qatar.

690
00:47:23.552 --> 00:47:24.887
tarmac security in
the last three days.

691
00:47:24.887 --> 00:47:26.054
What do you see?

692
00:47:26.054 --> 00:47:27.556
They're loading the planes.

693
00:47:27.556 --> 00:47:29.516
Right. all 767s.
one load per plane.

694
00:47:29.516 --> 00:47:30.976
What's your point?

695
00:47:30.976 --> 00:47:33.145
Okay. so here's our 767.

696
00:47:34.313 --> 00:47:35.772
There are two crates.

697
00:47:35.772 --> 00:47:37.858
All right. now
look at the wheels.

698
00:47:37.858 --> 00:47:39.526
Before. and after.

699
00:47:39.526 --> 00:47:41.445
Now. that's carrying
some serious weight.

700
00:47:41.445 --> 00:47:43.488
Now how much do those
Russian scramblers weigh?

701
00:47:43.488 --> 00:47:45.199
20. 30 pounds.

702
00:47:45.199 --> 00:47:46.325
That engineer left more
than just a scrambler

703
00:47:46.325 --> 00:47:47.367
on that plane.

704
00:47:50.412 --> 00:47:52.206
Raptor
three is in position.

705
00:47:52.206 --> 00:47:54.374
I'm waiting for a go code.

706
00:47:55.834 --> 00:47:59.796
Sir. the raptor
is waiting on your go command.

707
00:47:59.796 --> 00:48:01.089
What is it?

708
00:48:01.089 --> 00:48:02.633
It could be anything.

709
00:48:02.633 --> 00:48:04.468
But. you think it's something.

710
00:48:04.468 --> 00:48:05.219
What?

711
00:48:07.054 --> 00:48:10.724
Sir. we don't believe
in coincidences. right?

712
00:48:12.684 --> 00:48:14.686
Back during the Cold War.

713
00:48:14.686 --> 00:48:17.314
the Soviets developed
a handful of low yield

714
00:48:17.314 --> 00:48:18.649
portable devices.

715
00:48:18.649 --> 00:48:20.442
Once the wall came down.

716
00:48:20.442 --> 00:48:22.694
almost half of them
disappeared overnight.

717
00:48:22.694 --> 00:48:24.029
Wait a second.

718
00:48:24.029 --> 00:48:25.155
Low yield?

719
00:48:25.155 --> 00:48:26.323
Sir. you're talking about--

720
00:48:26.323 --> 00:48:28.534
You're talking about nukes.

721
00:48:28.534 --> 00:48:30.577
Are we looking at
Russian involvement?

722
00:48:30.577 --> 00:48:33.705
No. it was smuggled
through Lithuania years ago.

723
00:48:33.705 --> 00:48:35.374
along with the scramblers.

724
00:48:35.374 --> 00:48:37.543
Division has been trying
to track them ever since.

725
00:48:37.543 --> 00:48:38.585
Jesus Christ.

726
00:48:38.585 --> 00:48:39.586
Naznas.

727
00:48:39.586 --> 00:48:40.963
A nuclear blast.

728
00:48:42.965 --> 00:48:44.800
Yes. go ahead.

729
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.968
Uh-huh.

730
00:48:45.968 --> 00:48:47.594
Wait. this has been confirmed?

731
00:48:47.594 --> 00:48:48.595
What?

732
00:48:48.595 --> 00:48:50.389
Engineer's talking.

733
00:48:50.389 --> 00:48:54.643
Says there's a nuclear
device placed on that flight.

734
00:48:54.643 --> 00:48:56.270
Thank you.

735
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:58.146
I need the SecDef on
the phone right away.

736
00:48:58.146 --> 00:48:59.189
Abort.

737
00:48:59.189 --> 00:49:00.732
Abort. abort.

738
00:49:00.732 --> 00:49:02.359
Abort.

739
00:49:02.359 --> 00:49:04.653
Mr. Secretary. we
have a situation here.

740
00:49:04.653 --> 00:49:07.990
I suggest we go to
Defcon Two immediately.

741
00:49:20.544 --> 00:49:21.712
Leika...

742
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:24.882
Orca!

743
00:49:49.323 --> 00:49:51.742
Okay. so look. I got the
specs on one of these things.

744
00:49:51.742 --> 00:49:53.869
It's a fucking
nasty piece of work.

745
00:49:53.869 --> 00:49:55.370
See. look. here.

746
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:56.914
It's fitted with an
impact detonator.

747
00:49:56.914 --> 00:49:58.498
So now we have to
shoot it out of the sky.

748
00:49:58.498 --> 00:49:59.875
There's no other choice.

749
00:49:59.875 --> 00:50:01.710
Nuclear explosion
at that altitude

750
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:03.712
creates an EMP pulse that'll
knock the Eastern Seaboard

751
00:50:03.712 --> 00:50:05.214
back into the Stone Age.

752
00:50:05.214 --> 00:50:06.715
So. we can't shoot
it out of the sky.

753
00:50:06.715 --> 00:50:08.717
and the nuke goes
off when it crashes.

754
00:50:08.717 --> 00:50:09.551
Exactly.

755
00:50:09.551 --> 00:50:10.594
God damn...

756
00:50:11.929 --> 00:50:13.472
Sir.

757
00:50:13.472 --> 00:50:15.933
I have something I
think you should hear.

758
00:50:15.933 --> 00:50:19.102
We pulled this down off a
geostationary DMSP satcom

759
00:50:19.102 --> 00:50:21.188
about 20 minutes ago.

760
00:50:21.188 --> 00:50:25.984
It's a signal between Oceanic
402 and this facility.

761
00:50:43.836 --> 00:50:45.212
You got lucky.

762
00:50:45.212 --> 00:50:47.589
I did what I
thought was right.

763
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:50.300
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

764
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.887
We're not in some ethics
seminar at Harvard Law.

765
00:50:53.887 --> 00:50:56.473
We're not here to do
what we think is right.

766
00:50:56.473 --> 00:50:57.891
We're here to follow orders.

767
00:50:57.891 --> 00:50:59.852
You deliberately disobeyed me.

768
00:50:59.852 --> 00:51:01.019
And stopped a nuke from-

769
00:51:01.019 --> 00:51:02.354
Please don't interrupt me.

770
00:51:02.354 --> 00:51:03.856
The only reason
you're not wearing

771
00:51:03.856 --> 00:51:04.982
government issued
bracelets right now

772
00:51:04.982 --> 00:51:06.567
is because of that nuke.

773
00:51:06.567 --> 00:51:08.193
There's still a chance!

774
00:51:08.193 --> 00:51:09.570
How do you know?

775
00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:12.322
Because there's
always a chance!

776
00:51:14.157 --> 00:51:17.286
How many times have you
applied for the director's job.

777
00:51:17.286 --> 00:51:19.705
my job. and been rejected?

778
00:51:20.998 --> 00:51:21.790
Five.

779
00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.796
You still believe
there's a chance?

780
00:51:29.923 --> 00:51:32.301
Because you haven't lost.

781
00:51:32.301 --> 00:51:35.470
Because you haven't really lost.

782
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:37.931
You haven't learned
how difficult

783
00:51:37.931 --> 00:51:41.018
the consequences of
indecision can be.

784
00:51:41.018 --> 00:51:44.062
You haven't had to make
a call on a sleeper cell.

785
00:51:44.062 --> 00:51:46.940
responsible for the
bombings of grade schools.

786
00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.651
only to have Washington
stand you down

787
00:51:49.651 --> 00:51:52.738
because they didn't
want to escalate.

788
00:51:54.072 --> 00:51:56.658
You didn't have to stay
up for two weeks straight

789
00:51:56.658 --> 00:51:59.077
because your daughter
was kidnapped

790
00:51:59.077 --> 00:52:03.624
by that same cell
that Washington told you not to touch.

791
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:08.420
You didn't have to
watch her beheading

792
00:52:11.381 --> 00:52:12.758
on a livestream.

793
00:52:14.009 --> 00:52:14.968
I'm sorry.

794
00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:20.974
Luck runs out.

795
00:52:22.601 --> 00:52:24.394
And the only reason you
think there's still a chance

796
00:52:24.394 --> 00:52:28.440
is because you don't know
what the world really is.

797
00:52:30.275 --> 00:52:31.193
Maybe not.

798
00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.864
But I know what it can be.

799
00:52:39.952 --> 00:52:40.953
You can go.

800
00:53:11.567 --> 00:53:12.985
What do we do now?

801
00:53:12.985 --> 00:53:14.069
Listen to me.

802
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:15.571
This is a suicide mission.

803
00:53:15.571 --> 00:53:17.114
They're using this
plane as a missile.

804
00:53:17.114 --> 00:53:18.740
We don't know that for sure.

805
00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.784
Our own government
tried to shoot us down.

806
00:53:20.784 --> 00:53:22.077
Nobody's coming.

807
00:53:22.077 --> 00:53:23.287
We're on our own.

808
00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:32.504
Heathrow finally came through
with the security footage.

809
00:53:32.504 --> 00:53:34.423
We're running face
analysis on it now.

810
00:53:34.423 --> 00:53:36.216
Where are we with
that comm link?

811
00:53:36.216 --> 00:53:38.594
Seven minutes until the
satellite's in range. sir.

812
00:53:38.594 --> 00:53:40.262
Let's stop bullshitting!

813
00:53:40.262 --> 00:53:42.598
Our guy needs a plan. and now.

814
00:53:44.057 --> 00:53:45.851
All right. just
take that back.

815
00:53:45.851 --> 00:53:46.894
It's no good.

816
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:50.606
Go back and see what they say.

817
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:00.991
Fuck!

818
00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.296
Shut the fuck up.

819
00:54:14.296 --> 00:54:15.547
Shut the fuck up.

820
00:54:17.382 --> 00:54:19.134
Let him go!

821
00:54:23.305 --> 00:54:24.056
Fuck!

822
00:55:08.517 --> 00:55:10.477
Give me the gun

823
00:55:13.856 --> 00:55:15.399
Stop fucking around.

824
00:55:32.624 --> 00:55:34.334
Let me ask you this.

825
00:55:36.753 --> 00:55:40.132
What is the greatest
struggle. my brother?

826
00:55:40.132 --> 00:55:43.594
To avenge the slaughter
of the innocents.

827
00:55:46.096 --> 00:55:50.058
What I am asking is a
more difficult question.

828
00:55:51.685 --> 00:55:55.355
The path that you were
on will not lead you

829
00:55:55.355 --> 00:55:57.608
to the peace you are seeking.

830
00:55:59.943 --> 00:56:03.989
Vengeance is both rational
and morally justifiable

831
00:56:03.989 --> 00:56:06.033
in the face of injustice.

832
00:56:07.409 --> 00:56:11.455
Prompted to my vengeance
by both heaven and hell.

833
00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.627
You missed the
moral of that story.

834
00:56:16.627 --> 00:56:19.755
Hamlet is blinded
by his revenge.

835
00:56:19.755 --> 00:56:22.799
It steers him down
a path of evil.

836
00:56:22.799 --> 00:56:25.886
His deeds inevitably
become worse and worse

837
00:56:25.886 --> 00:56:30.557
without him realizing the
gradual corruption of his soul.

838
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:35.771
The struggle to forbid
the evil to mend the good.

839
00:56:37.272 --> 00:56:41.944
this battle. this is the
greatest struggle. my brother.

840
00:56:43.153 --> 00:56:45.030
The journey to
find the true way.

841
00:56:55.499 --> 00:56:57.501
You're not my brother.

842
00:57:18.272 --> 00:57:19.523
Remy.

843
00:57:19.523 --> 00:57:20.524
Jesus. Chief.

844
00:57:22.317 --> 00:57:24.903
I know how we can
reboot the failsafe.

845
00:57:24.903 --> 00:57:26.029
How?

846
00:57:26.029 --> 00:57:27.739
We reinstall it.

847
00:57:27.739 --> 00:57:29.199
What?

848
00:57:29.199 --> 00:57:30.534
The backup boot
is still up there

849
00:57:30.534 --> 00:57:32.286
on the main flight
control server.

850
00:57:32.286 --> 00:57:34.204
Now that the failsafe
has been disengaged.

851
00:57:34.204 --> 00:57:36.415
we can install the
package remotely.

852
00:57:36.415 --> 00:57:38.125
Yeah. but sir. we have
no way of transmitting

853
00:57:38.125 --> 00:57:39.668
the run code.

854
00:57:39.668 --> 00:57:40.794
The packet's way too big
for a commercial airline

855
00:57:40.794 --> 00:57:42.045
to receive it at that altitude.

856
00:57:42.045 --> 00:57:43.547
But not the raptor escort.

857
00:57:43.547 --> 00:57:45.841
They get mission
packages twice that size.

858
00:57:45.841 --> 00:57:48.010
What. you're saying the
raptor becomes a relay?

859
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:49.428
Once you download the package.

860
00:57:49.428 --> 00:57:50.804
the install will
take care of itself.

861
00:57:50.804 --> 00:57:52.848
and we'll have a
fresh failsafe ready

862
00:57:52.848 --> 00:57:55.559
to accept the
default set up codes.

863
00:57:56.768 --> 00:57:59.771
Can you do this for me. Remy?

864
00:57:59.771 --> 00:58:01.356
Absolutely. sir.

865
00:58:07.529 --> 00:58:08.280
Goran!

866
00:58:14.953 --> 00:58:15.704
You.

867
00:58:16.663 --> 00:58:18.582
Get back to your seat.

868
00:58:25.172 --> 00:58:27.382
Can I
please have some water?

869
00:58:27.382 --> 00:58:28.300
Please!

870
00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.635
Shut up!

871
00:58:53.325 --> 00:58:55.911
Facial analysis just
finished the Heathrow footage.

872
00:58:55.911 --> 00:58:57.829
We got IDs on all but one.

873
00:59:03.877 --> 00:59:05.671
Slouris.

874
00:59:05.671 --> 00:59:07.422
Enid Slouris?

875
00:59:07.422 --> 00:59:09.550
Now we know where
they're headed.

876
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:10.676
Where?

877
00:59:10.676 --> 00:59:12.261
Here.

878
00:59:12.261 --> 00:59:13.720
He's coming for me.

879
00:59:31.864 --> 00:59:33.907
Anan. what are you doing?

880
00:59:45.586 --> 00:59:48.839
Why is Slouris coming
here to kill you?

881
00:59:50.507 --> 00:59:53.552
Because history always
catches up with you.

882
00:59:53.552 --> 00:59:54.761
You knew him?

883
00:59:56.013 --> 00:59:59.349
I created him.
after my daughter.

884
00:59:59.349 --> 01:00:01.018
What did you do?

885
01:00:01.018 --> 01:00:03.854
I wanted to hurt as
many of them as I could.

886
01:00:03.854 --> 01:00:08.275
I didn't care what it cost
or who had to pay the price.

887
01:00:09.985 --> 01:00:12.487
The man most responsible
for Catarina's death.

888
01:00:12.487 --> 01:00:16.200
that's Enid's wife.
was named Abdul Hamas.

889
01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.118
He worked out ofa local market.

890
01:00:18.118 --> 01:00:22.122
using civilians in a nearby
village as human shields.

891
01:00:22.122 --> 01:00:23.790
He didn't think we would risk

892
01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.959
that kind of collateral damage.

893
01:00:25.959 --> 01:00:28.128
but intelligence
didn't know about

894
01:00:28.128 --> 01:00:31.924
the ammonium nitrate
munitions depot.

895
01:00:31.924 --> 01:00:36.345
One of the boys in that school
was the son of Enid Slouris.

896
01:00:36.345 --> 01:00:37.429
After that...

897
01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:42.184
Slouris became a virus.

898
01:00:42.184 --> 01:00:45.020
He infects other extremist
terrorist groups.

899
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.856
he perverts their
supposed politics.

900
01:00:47.856 --> 01:00:50.150
He uses them for
his own purpose.

901
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:52.319
Remember that attack in
Cape Town two years ago?

902
01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:53.862
Yeah. that was
Green September.

903
01:00:53.862 --> 01:00:56.198
That was Slouris
using Green September.

904
01:00:56.198 --> 01:00:59.910
And now he's on that
plane coming for you.

905
01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:08.544
I need to go to the cockpit.

906
01:01:08.544 --> 01:01:10.963
Did your friends get in touch?

907
01:01:10.963 --> 01:01:15.175
Just get the passengers
ready to roll on my signal.

908
01:01:44.997 --> 01:01:47.165
There's four of them
between us and the cockpit.

909
01:01:47.165 --> 01:01:48.250
Five.

910
01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.251
I know Alex is with us.

911
01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:50.836
He can fly the plane.

912
01:01:50.836 --> 01:01:51.962
That makes no sense.
he killed that guy.

913
01:01:51.962 --> 01:01:53.422
I don't have time to explain.

914
01:01:53.422 --> 01:01:54.548
You're just gonna
have to trust me.

915
01:01:54.548 --> 01:01:55.716
If we do nothing. we will die.

916
01:01:55.716 --> 01:01:57.259
We must take a stand together.

917
01:01:57.259 --> 01:01:58.510
I'm not doing anything
until we can prove that-

918
01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:00.262
You don't have a choice.

919
01:02:00.262 --> 01:02:02.973
He's the only one
who can help us.

920
01:02:37.216 --> 01:02:38.634
Shut up!

921
01:02:38.634 --> 01:02:41.053
What do you think you're doing?

922
01:02:41.053 --> 01:02:41.803
Shut up.

923
01:03:01.156 --> 01:03:04.117
Somebody has a plan and
we're taking over the plane.

924
01:03:10.249 --> 01:03:11.458
Orca!

925
01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:22.803
This is it!

926
01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:45.659
Again!

927
01:04:13.645 --> 01:04:16.398
We are with you. my brother.

928
01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:22.529
You are a traitor Alex!

929
01:04:22.529 --> 01:04:24.281
The traitor was Marco.

930
01:05:49.658 --> 01:05:50.409
Doctor.

931
01:05:51.618 --> 01:05:55.956
I think some of your
passengers may need your help.

932
01:05:56.915 --> 01:05:57.666
I'm good.

933
01:06:05.257 --> 01:06:07.968
Yeah. they're all down.

934
01:06:10.804 --> 01:06:12.764
Steak-knife.
can you hear me?

935
01:06:12.764 --> 01:06:13.932
Who is this?

936
01:06:15.017 --> 01:06:16.602
NSA Director Hawkins.

937
01:06:16.602 --> 01:06:20.105
Steak-knife. priority
one. enter the cockpit.

938
01:06:20.105 --> 01:06:21.481
Mr. Hawkins...

939
01:06:22.774 --> 01:06:23.525
Copy that.

940
01:06:28.155 --> 01:06:31.825
If anyone's wounded.
let yourself be known.

941
01:06:42.836 --> 01:06:45.797
Steak-knife. your F22 escort
is standing by to transmit

942
01:06:45.797 --> 01:06:48.509
the reset codes for
your failsafe system.

943
01:06:48.509 --> 01:06:50.177
What good does that do me?

944
01:06:50.177 --> 01:06:52.638
You'll automatically be
diverted to runway 2882.

945
01:06:52.638 --> 01:06:55.057
10 mile due South of
your current position.

946
01:06:55.057 --> 01:06:57.809
Once the failsafe is
restored. you'll have to reset

947
01:06:57.809 --> 01:07:01.855
the navigation breakers
under the center console.

948
01:07:03.106 --> 01:07:04.191
10 miles...

949
01:07:05.442 --> 01:07:07.486
We don't have enough fuel. sir.

950
01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:08.779
Yes. you do.

951
01:07:08.779 --> 01:07:10.614
There's still a chance.

952
01:07:16.703 --> 01:07:19.498
Can you really fly this thing?

953
01:07:20.791 --> 01:07:23.377
When I flip the switch
on these navigation busses.

954
01:07:23.377 --> 01:07:25.796
the control system
will lose power.

955
01:07:25.796 --> 01:07:27.798
And then what?

956
01:07:27.798 --> 01:07:28.674
Buckle up.

957
01:07:34.763 --> 01:07:36.640
I need everyone to buckle up!

958
01:07:44.273 --> 01:07:46.817
Antenna's online. sir.

959
01:07:46.817 --> 01:07:47.568
Yep.

960
01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.237
Raptor 3. transmit.

961
01:07:50.237 --> 01:07:51.572
Roger. command.

962
01:07:51.572 --> 01:07:53.115
Transmitting packet.

963
01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.704
It's done. sir.

964
01:07:58.704 --> 01:08:00.455
Reset the breakers.

965
01:08:39.036 --> 01:08:40.579
Come on!

966
01:09:16.073 --> 01:09:17.449
You're mine now.

967
01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:21.954
Nice work. Steak-knife.

968
01:09:21.954 --> 01:09:24.039
Now. you need to input
the authorization code

969
01:09:24.039 --> 01:09:26.166
to give the failsafe control.

970
01:09:26.458 --> 01:09:30.963
The code is Tango
Oscar Sierra Mike

971
01:09:31.129 --> 01:09:34.925
Hotel Echo Lima Lima Five Four.

972
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:40.764
Steak-knife. did
you copy my last?

973
01:09:41.682 --> 01:09:44.893
We can't engage the
system without the code.

974
01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:06.248
I'm dead...

975
01:10:06.248 --> 01:10:07.457
Dead.

976
01:10:07.457 --> 01:10:08.458
No.

977
01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:10.127
No. you're not dead.

978
01:10:10.127 --> 01:10:13.422
Are they dead?

979
01:10:13.672 --> 01:10:14.548
The others?

980
01:10:16.049 --> 01:10:17.342
Yeah.

981
01:10:17.342 --> 01:10:19.178
They're all dead.

982
01:10:19.178 --> 01:10:23.640
Except for the undercover
agent that intercepted you.

983
01:10:27.603 --> 01:10:28.353
No...

984
01:10:29.605 --> 01:10:31.773
I'm the Interpol agent...

985
01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:34.943
What?

986
01:10:36.486 --> 01:10:39.531
Steak-knife.
I need to hear you.

987
01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:41.200
Use the code.

988
01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:46.038
Steak-knife. are you hearing me?

989
01:10:47.581 --> 01:10:50.250
Please confirm
you have the code.

990
01:11:09.144 --> 01:11:10.729
This is Steak-knife.

991
01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:12.689
Identification code
Alpha-Six-Three-Five.

992
01:11:12.689 --> 01:11:14.733
Operation American City
infiltration is a ruse.

993
01:11:14.733 --> 01:11:16.443
Team's real mission
is hijacking.

994
01:11:16.443 --> 01:11:18.028
I repeat. hijacking.

995
01:11:18.028 --> 01:11:20.113
There are five armed
hijackers onboard.

996
01:11:20.113 --> 01:11:21.114
Do you copy?

997
01:11:21.114 --> 01:11:22.699
Everyone. stay calm.

998
01:11:22.699 --> 01:11:23.784
Move to the left of
the airplane. please.

999
01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:24.618
Now. ma'am.

1000
01:11:42.386 --> 01:11:45.264
Steak-knife.
can you hear me?

1001
01:11:45.264 --> 01:11:47.474
Steak-knife. are you there?

1002
01:11:48.433 --> 01:11:51.144
He never was. Mr. Hawkins.

1003
01:12:03.156 --> 01:12:03.907
Slouris!

1004
01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:14.084
Roll my sleeve.

1005
01:12:19.882 --> 01:12:23.677
These are the access
codes to the cockpit door.

1006
01:12:23.677 --> 01:12:25.262
You have to stop him.

1007
01:12:25.262 --> 01:12:28.015
No. no. no. no. no. I can't...

1008
01:12:29.266 --> 01:12:31.310
I can't fly the plane.

1009
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:34.229
You can't let him
crash the plane.

1010
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:36.398
There's a nuke on board.

1011
01:12:49.411 --> 01:12:50.704
No...

1012
01:12:50.704 --> 01:12:51.455
No.

1013
01:12:55.959 --> 01:12:57.252
Okay. okay...

1014
01:14:06.196 --> 01:14:06.947
No!

1015
01:14:11.368 --> 01:14:12.119
No!

1016
01:14:55.495 --> 01:14:57.247
I'll be with you soon.

1017
01:15:07.382 --> 01:15:08.383
Stop!

1018
01:15:08.383 --> 01:15:09.801
No. you lied to me!

1019
01:15:09.801 --> 01:15:10.552
Just stop.

1020
01:15:12.721 --> 01:15:16.058
Why did you kill
your own people?

1021
01:15:16.058 --> 01:15:17.559
I had no choice.

1022
01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:20.687
When they found the earpiece.

1023
01:15:20.687 --> 01:15:23.732
I knew one of them was
an undercover agent.

1024
01:15:23.732 --> 01:15:26.276
I just didn't know which one.

1025
01:15:26.276 --> 01:15:28.153
I had to kill them all.

1026
01:15:29.446 --> 01:15:30.656
I helped you...

1027
01:15:32.783 --> 01:15:34.535
God. you...

1028
01:15:34.535 --> 01:15:35.869
No.

1029
01:15:35.869 --> 01:15:38.080
God has nothing to do with this.

1030
01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.122
Then what. Alex?

1031
01:15:39.122 --> 01:15:39.915
Why?

1032
01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:41.708
Justice.

1033
01:15:44.878 --> 01:15:47.631
So we all die
for your justice?

1034
01:15:48.924 --> 01:15:50.509
Who dies for ours?

1035
01:15:51.552 --> 01:15:52.886
When does it stop?

1036
01:15:53.887 --> 01:15:55.389
It never stops.

1037
01:15:56.849 --> 01:15:58.100
Give me the fucking...

1038
01:16:02.688 --> 01:16:03.438
Fuck!

1039
01:16:34.261 --> 01:16:35.762
You fucking shot me.

1040
01:16:42.436 --> 01:16:43.687
Are you okay?

1041
01:16:45.397 --> 01:16:46.565
Okay. come on.

1042
01:16:48.942 --> 01:16:49.693
Okay...

1043
01:16:54.865 --> 01:16:56.825
Are we gonna crash?

1044
01:16:56.825 --> 01:16:58.827
We're gonna try not to.

1045
01:16:58.827 --> 01:16:59.828
Hello?

1046
01:16:59.828 --> 01:17:01.163
Hello. is anyone there?

1047
01:17:01.163 --> 01:17:02.748
Can anyone hear me?

1048
01:17:02.748 --> 01:17:04.374
Someone's
on the pilot channel.

1049
01:17:04.374 --> 01:17:05.584
Patch me in.

1050
01:17:05.584 --> 01:17:06.960
Can anyone help me?

1051
01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.295
Identify yourself.

1052
01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:10.005
My name is Kim.

1053
01:17:10.005 --> 01:17:11.965
Okay. Kim. my name is Hawkins.

1054
01:17:11.965 --> 01:17:14.051
Do you have control
of the plane?

1055
01:17:14.051 --> 01:17:18.055
I guess so. but I
don't know how to fly.

1056
01:17:18.055 --> 01:17:19.723
What about the hijackers?

1057
01:17:19.723 --> 01:17:21.266
All down.

1058
01:17:21.266 --> 01:17:23.143
Okay. I'm gonna
talk you through this.

1059
01:17:23.143 --> 01:17:24.895
I want you to look at the
main console in front of you.

1060
01:17:24.895 --> 01:17:26.271
Tell me what you see.

1061
01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:27.648
Main console?

1062
01:17:27.648 --> 01:17:28.815
It's right here.

1063
01:17:28.815 --> 01:17:30.442
Here?

1064
01:17:30.442 --> 01:17:31.944
Okay. it's asking for
an authorization code.

1065
01:17:31.944 --> 01:17:34.947
Okay. type in the following.

1066
01:17:34.947 --> 01:17:36.073
These inputs. Kim.

1067
01:17:36.073 --> 01:17:36.907
Here. okay.

1068
01:17:36.907 --> 01:17:37.908
Yeah. yeah. go.

1069
01:17:37.908 --> 01:17:38.951
Tango.

1070
01:17:38.951 --> 01:17:39.868
Tango.

1071
01:17:39.868 --> 01:17:40.911
Oscar.

1072
01:17:40.911 --> 01:17:41.954
- Mike.
- Mike.

1073
01:17:41.954 --> 01:17:42.913

1074
01:17:42.913 --> 01:17:44.373
- Hotel.

1075
01:17:44.373 --> 01:17:45.999
- Echo.
- Echo.

1076
01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:47.543
Lima.

1077
01:17:47.543 --> 01:17:48.585
Lima.

1078
01:17:48.585 --> 01:17:49.545
Five four.

1079
01:17:49.545 --> 01:17:50.879
Five.

1080
01:17:50.879 --> 01:17:51.630
Four.

1081
01:17:55.008 --> 01:17:56.301
Everybody!

1082
01:17:56.301 --> 01:17:57.886
Get ready to brace!

1083
01:18:05.978 --> 01:18:07.521
Failsafe engaged.

1084
01:18:07.521 --> 01:18:09.690
Rerouting to safe landing.

1085
01:18:12.734 --> 01:18:15.320
ETA to landing site?

1086
01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.905
10 minutes. Chief.

1087
01:18:19.241 --> 01:18:20.784
All right.

1088
01:18:20.784 --> 01:18:22.703
We don't have
enough fuel. Kim.

1089
01:18:22.703 --> 01:18:23.787
Tell them.

1090
01:18:23.787 --> 01:18:24.621
Hello?

1091
01:18:24.621 --> 01:18:26.039
Hello?

1092
01:18:26.039 --> 01:18:27.165
No!

1093
01:18:27.165 --> 01:18:28.667
Hello?

1094
01:18:28.667 --> 01:18:29.418
Kim?

1095
01:18:30.252 --> 01:18:31.545
He's waking up!

1096
01:18:37.009 --> 01:18:39.720
It's rerouting you to the
nearest automated runway.

1097
01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:42.014
It's nine minutes away.

1098
01:18:42.014 --> 01:18:43.682
You'll never make it.

1099
01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:48.687
There's a private landing
strip a few miles away.

1100
01:18:48.687 --> 01:18:50.480
You'll have to go manual.

1101
01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.065
I can't do that!

1102
01:18:52.065 --> 01:18:53.775
Yes. you can.

1103
01:18:53.775 --> 01:18:56.028
I'll talk you through it.

1104
01:18:56.028 --> 01:18:58.322
Two minutes ago you were
gonna crash this plane

1105
01:18:58.322 --> 01:18:59.865
with all of us on it.

1106
01:18:59.865 --> 01:19:02.242
and now you want to save us?

1107
01:19:02.242 --> 01:19:02.993
Yes.

1108
01:19:06.955 --> 01:19:08.707
We're running out of fuel.

1109
01:19:08.707 --> 01:19:10.959
We're gonna lose an engine.

1110
01:19:12.377 --> 01:19:13.587
Jump up. Sam.

1111
01:19:13.587 --> 01:19:14.922
Jump up.

1112
01:19:14.922 --> 01:19:15.672
Jump up!

1113
01:19:16.548 --> 01:19:17.508
Good boy.

1114
01:19:20.761 --> 01:19:24.223
If he tries anything.
you just shoot him.

1115
01:19:36.276 --> 01:19:39.238
Sir. they've re-disabled
the failsafe override.

1116
01:19:39.238 --> 01:19:43.200
We've lost autocontrol
of the plane.

1117
01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.453
First. that's not
a steering wheel.

1118
01:19:46.453 --> 01:19:48.080
It's a yoke.

1119
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:53.043
Move left and right.
to roll the plane.

1120
01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:58.340
Push forward to pitch
the wheels down.

1121
01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:01.093
Pull back to pitch
the nose back up.

1122
01:20:02.553 --> 01:20:05.055
See those pedals by your foot?

1123
01:20:05.055 --> 01:20:06.098
Yeah.

1124
01:20:06.098 --> 01:20:07.516
That's your rudder.

1125
01:20:07.516 --> 01:20:09.268
Now. using your left leg.

1126
01:20:09.268 --> 01:20:13.355
turn us west until this
reads two-zero-two.

1127
01:20:25.576 --> 01:20:26.785
Everybody!

1128
01:20:26.785 --> 01:20:28.203
Get ready to brace!

1129
01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:32.332
Target
veering off course.

1130
01:20:32.332 --> 01:20:33.458
Permission to fire.

1131
01:20:33.458 --> 01:20:34.334
Negative Raptor 31.

1132
01:20:34.334 --> 01:20:35.836
Negative!

1133
01:20:35.836 --> 01:20:38.297
There's a nuclear
bomb on that plane!

1134
01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:54.229
Raptor
3 standing down.

1135
01:20:56.523 --> 01:20:57.232
Ah.

1136
01:20:59.484 --> 01:21:01.320
You did it. Kim.

1137
01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.488
What's the name of that
airport they're headed for?

1138
01:21:03.488 --> 01:21:07.117
Patcher Field.
about a mile off I-64.

1139
01:21:07.117 --> 01:21:09.786
I want you to contact
local PD. fire. and rescue.

1140
01:21:09.786 --> 01:21:11.496
We have to set a perimeter.

1141
01:21:11.496 --> 01:21:14.499
Tell DOE. they need to move
in and secure that nuke

1142
01:21:14.499 --> 01:21:17.377
the moment that plane
touches that runway.

1143
01:21:17.377 --> 01:21:18.462
What's the local hospital?

1144
01:21:18.462 --> 01:21:19.838
Jackson General.

1145
01:21:19.838 --> 01:21:22.257
Tell them to expect incoming.

1146
01:21:24.009 --> 01:21:26.845
Four red lights.
you're too low.

1147
01:21:26.845 --> 01:21:29.890
Four white ones.
you're too high.

1148
01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:33.602
Two red. two white will
get you to the runway.

1149
01:21:38.065 --> 01:21:39.858
Now. you can't lower
the landing gear

1150
01:21:39.858 --> 01:21:43.570
or the wind will
tear the wheels off.

1151
01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:47.282
Use the throttle and
push back on the nose

1152
01:21:47.282 --> 01:21:49.076
to bleed off more speed.

1153
01:21:49.076 --> 01:21:49.826
Okay.

1154
01:21:52.579 --> 01:21:54.456
Do you feel that?

1155
01:21:54.456 --> 01:21:55.541
You feel that?

1156
01:21:55.541 --> 01:21:56.583
That feels good.

1157
01:21:56.583 --> 01:21:58.210
Feels good.

1158
01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:01.338
Now. slow down the
throttle for the descent.

1159
01:22:04.633 --> 01:22:07.594
That's good.

1160
01:22:07.594 --> 01:22:09.304
Another second now.

1161
01:22:09.304 --> 01:22:11.139
Another notch of flaps.

1162
01:22:15.519 --> 01:22:16.353
Come on!

1163
01:22:18.438 --> 01:22:19.147
Good.

1164
01:22:20.482 --> 01:22:23.986
You're going slow enough
for the landing gear.

1165
01:22:25.445 --> 01:22:26.780
Push this lever.

1166
01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:28.115
- All the way down.
- This one?

1167
01:22:28.115 --> 01:22:29.074
That?

1168
01:22:29.074 --> 01:22:30.450
All the way down!

1169
01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.705
Sam. come here!

1170
01:22:34.705 --> 01:22:36.582
Samuel!

1171
01:22:36.582 --> 01:22:39.710
When we pass over the fence.
I want you to cut the engine

1172
01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:42.379
using these two buttons here.

1173
01:22:42.379 --> 01:22:44.506
Then I want you to cut the fuel

1174
01:22:44.506 --> 01:22:47.134
using this button here.

1175
01:22:47.134 --> 01:22:49.094
You can't have
the engine running

1176
01:22:49.094 --> 01:22:52.306
in case anything bad happens.

1177
01:22:52.306 --> 01:22:53.265
I trust you.

1178
01:22:54.808 --> 01:22:57.186
Your dad would be
very proud of you.

1179
01:22:57.186 --> 01:22:58.312
Yeah.

1180
01:22:58.312 --> 01:22:59.438
That will work.

1181
01:23:04.234 --> 01:23:05.235
Runway!

1182
01:23:05.235 --> 01:23:06.486
Runway!

1183
01:23:06.486 --> 01:23:07.946
Sam. cut the engines!

1184
01:23:07.946 --> 01:23:09.198
But it's too low!

1185
01:23:09.198 --> 01:23:10.449
Cut the fuel!

1186
01:23:11.658 --> 01:23:12.659
Kim!

1187
01:23:12.659 --> 01:23:14.036
Keep her steady.

1188
01:23:21.418 --> 01:23:22.252
Sam. brace!

1189
01:24:32.823 --> 01:24:34.491
Plane is down.

1190
01:24:34.491 --> 01:24:35.576
What?

1191
01:24:35.576 --> 01:24:37.411
No detonation.

1192
01:24:40.455 --> 01:24:41.206
Yes.

1193
01:25:05.355 --> 01:25:07.191
Come on. we gotta go.

1194
01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:10.611
Come on.

1195
01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.427
Is that the fifth?

1196
01:26:58.427 --> 01:26:59.928
Sixth. actually.

1197
01:27:01.013 --> 01:27:02.639
Well. I wouldn't
worry about it.

1198
01:27:02.639 --> 01:27:04.016
There's always the
chance the seventh

1199
01:27:04.016 --> 01:27:05.893
will turn out differently.

1200
01:27:05.893 --> 01:27:10.063
Isn't that right. Director
of Operations Toyin?

1201
01:27:10.063 --> 01:27:11.231
Yes. sir.

1202
01:27:12.357 --> 01:27:13.734
Always a chance.

1203
01:27:15.068 --> 01:27:17.196
Congratulations.

1204
01:27:17.196 --> 01:27:18.113
And thank you.
