You have to come in here really quick!

41

I found some information that
you have to see right now!

42
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.851
You have to come in here right now!

43
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:22.684
Hurry up!

(intense music)

45
00:04:30.715 --> 00:04:34.139
- Becky. got your call. What's going on?

46
00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.497
- I just imaged an astroid and it jumped.

47
00:04:36.993 --> 00:04:37.826
There's only thing in the
universe that can do that.

48
00:04:40.102 --> 00:04:42.660
- What's going on? What do we have?

49
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.213
- It's an asteroid.

50
00:04:44.213 --> 00:04:45.491
- Is it true?
- I can't believe

51
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:46.602
what I'm hearing.
- Is it true?

52
00:04:46.602 --> 00:04:48.200
- No. no. it can't be.
- Yes. it is. it's true.

53
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.666
- Are you serious?
- Yes. it's a black hole.

54
00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:50.710
Yes. it's true!
- Do we have any research?

55
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.266
Do we have any paperwork on it?

56
00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:55.016
(dramatic music)

57
00:05:07.923 --> 00:05:11.001
(knocks on door)

58
00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:12.756
- General. you're here. Come on in.

59
00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:15.506
(dramatic music)

60
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.241
- Okay. little lady.
What do you got for me?

61
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:35.445
Let me hear it.

62
00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:40.293
- I just imaged an asteroid
and it jumped. sir.

63
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.253
There's only one object in
the universe that can do that.

64
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.490
- We believe it's a black hole. sir.

65
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.300
That's what the calculations suggest.

66
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.685
- Okay. you wanna explain
why this is important to me?

67
00:05:54.685 --> 00:05:56.349
- Two multi-aspects!

68
00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.572
(dramatic music)

69
00:05:59.572 --> 00:06:01.830
- Okay.
- It's bending light!

70
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.390
There's only one thing in the
universe that could do that!

71
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.580
In 10 years. it'll reach our solar system

72
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.130
and destroy it in its entirety!

73
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.690
- Okay. I'm gonna need everything you got.

74
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.100
Electronics. computers.
media. any print outs.

75
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.700
We have to get this to the
proper authorities in DC.

76
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.000
Don't hold anything back.

77
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.667
(ominous music)

78
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:30.588
(papers rustling)

79
00:06:35.074 --> 00:06:36.435
That's it?

80
00:06:36.435 --> 00:06:38.852
- Yes. sir.
- Okay. thank you.

81
00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:45.262
You know what to do.

82
00:06:45.262 --> 00:06:46.156
Ice the nerds.

83
00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.823
(intense music)

84
00:06:50.126 --> 00:06:51.334
- Hey. wait no!
(gun firing)

85
00:06:51.334 --> 00:06:52.962
- No!
- (screaming) Oh my God!

86
00:06:52.962 --> 00:06:54.484
(intense music)

87
00:06:54.484 --> 00:06:56.901
(gun firing)

88
00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:44.532
Forget it. Let me know
if there's any changes.

89
00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:47.199
(intense music)

90
00:08:03.396 --> 00:08:06.979
Andrew. let me speak
with Lieutenant Stone.

91
00:08:08.305 --> 00:08:09.893
Dennis Stone. Luciano Thomas.

92
00:08:09.893 --> 00:08:11.130
I'm gonna be coming in by chopper.

93
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.400
Could you have a car ready for me?

94
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.100
We gotta go right to the
VP's office when I get there.

95
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.540
Okay. no problem.

96
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.570
I'll see you there in.

97
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.950

98
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.105
Be ready. Thank you.

99
00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:26.136
(intense music)

100
00:08:26.136 --> 00:08:28.803
(gas trickling)

101
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.939
It's Thomas here.

102
00:08:32.939 --> 00:08:34.307
I just got done meeting with the nerds

103
00:08:34.307 --> 00:08:35.744
at the observatory.

104
00:08:35.744 --> 00:08:37.081
This don't look good.

105
00:08:37.081 --> 00:08:40.325
We got a black hole and
a serious situation.

106
00:08:40.325 --> 00:08:43.150
(indistinct)

107
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.817
(intense music)

108
00:08:58.637 --> 00:08:59.970
Five and a half.

109
00:09:00.886 --> 00:09:03.468
(gas trickling)

110
00:09:03.468 --> 00:09:06.135
(intense music)

111
00:10:16.213 --> 00:10:18.880
(fire roaring)

112
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.571
- There's no smoking.

113
00:11:04.571 --> 00:11:07.960
(lighter clicks)

114
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.273
So what's this urgency?

115
00:11:12.998 --> 00:11:14.646
- See for yourself. sir.

116
00:11:14.646 --> 00:11:17.396
(dramatic music)

117
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.700
- Okay. so what am I looking at?

118
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.650
- You're looking at the black hole. sir.

119
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.670
- It's in our solar system's path.

120
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.460
What you're looking at is
the complete annihilation

121
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.873
of human existence.

122
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.340
- I'll inform the president.

123
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.980
You inform NASA and the pentagon.

124
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.950
I don't have to say this
but I'm gonna say it.

125
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.013
Not a word to anyone. This is top secret.

126
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.362
- We've already taken
steps to assure that. sir.

127
00:11:59.362 --> 00:12:02.112
(dramatic music)

128
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:11.910
Yeah. you're gonna have
to cut that golf trip

129
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.170
a little short. sir.

130
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.150
No. we need to sit down
with our Space Force

131
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.563
and our corporate financier.

132
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:22.835
Yes.

133
00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:25.585
(dramatic music)

134
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.740
- Um. can I help you?

135
00:12:55.443 --> 00:12:57.710
"A radical left wing group
has started a string of terror

136
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.110
starting with the burning down

137
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.910
of the Westport Space
Observatory located in Westport.

138
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.720
killing all the astronomers inside.

139
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.660
The reasons are unclear."

140
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.060
I'm not reporting this shit.

141
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.693
Jesus.

142
00:13:19.918 --> 00:13:23.251
(dramatic theme music)

143
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.720
Live from the Westport Observatory.

144
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.210
a radical left wing group has
started a string of terror

145
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.320
starting with the burning down

146
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.940
of the Westport Space Observatory

147
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.440
located here in Westport.

148
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.570
killing all of the astronomers inside.

149
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.090
The reasons are unclear.

150
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.480
The Federal Bureau of Investigation

151
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.940
was brought in to find the terrorists

152
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.170
behind this heinous act.

153
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.050
The motive behind the burning
down of the space observatory

154
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.226
by this mystery group
has yet to be determined.

155
00:13:49.226 --> 00:13:54.226
(intense music)
(helicopter whirring)

156
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.320
- May I help you with something?

157
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.822
- Yeah. this entire
facility is being relocated.

158
00:14:27.822 --> 00:14:29.201
- What do you mean? Where?

159
00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:30.760
- What will become of our jobs?

160
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.260
- Your jobs go with you.

161
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.830
relocate your families to Florida.

162
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.370
and you go into the space station.

163
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.780
We're setting up a
hydroponics farm up there.

164
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.560
- Space station? As in space?

165
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.190
- Yeah.

166
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.640
- And what if we refuse?

167
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.950
- You refuse. you lose your job.

168
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.840
you go home to your family.

169
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.000
we get new botanists.

170
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.740
It's a government facility.
It's a government garden.

171
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.017
It's a government space station.

172
00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:55.159
It's that simple.

173
00:14:55.159 --> 00:14:58.492
(dramatic theme music)

174
00:15:01.676 --> 00:15:02.890
- Today on the "Four O'clock News."

175
00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.410
NASA will be announcing the construction

176
00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.030
of a new large space station.

177
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.635
The president will be addressing
this during his conference.

178
00:15:09.635 --> 00:15:12.468
(patriotic music)

179
00:15:14.568 --> 00:15:16.478
- Mr. President!
(indistinct)

180
00:15:16.478 --> 00:15:17.717
Can you comment on climate change?

181
00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:19.690
Climate change?
- Good evening.

182
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:20.980
In my first inaugural address.
(shutters clicking)

183
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.480
I committed myself to this country.

184
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.030
to the tireless task of
global peace between nations

185
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.460
and protecting the people
for future generations.

186
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.310
There I sat with the leaders
to discuss working together

187
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.130
in the new space race and combating acts

188
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.580
of terrorism together.

189
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.310
Today. the American people can be proud

190
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.580
because this historical agreement

191
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.590
is a tribute to American leadership.

192
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:39.630
- Yeah. but what about-
- Mr. President.

193
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.840
on the topic of oversight.

194
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.100
the committee has threatened to subpoena

195
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.410
the ethics department over
conflicts of interest.

196
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.930
Do you think it's appropriate for Congress

197
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.850
to be looking at the
comments made the ethics?

198
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.270
- That is not today's subject.
I will not comment over it.

199
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.423
Thank you everyone for coming out.

200
00:15:52.423 --> 00:15:53.429
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President.

201
00:15:53.429 --> 00:15:55.436

202
00:15:55.436 --> 00:16:00.436
(gentle music)
(group applauding)

203
00:16:02.725 --> 00:16:05.040
- But you're gonna miss all my birthdays.

204
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.012
- Mommy would never miss your
birthdays. I'll FaceTime you.

205
00:16:08.012 --> 00:16:10.268
- But who's gonna read my bedtime stories?

206
00:16:10.268 --> 00:16:12.003
- Don't worry. Mommy. I'm a big girl.

207
00:16:12.003 --> 00:16:14.526
I could take care of him.

208

(indistinct)

216
00:16:36.318 --> 00:16:38.179

forever.

304
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.900
This is for the survival
of the human race.

305
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.290
No one knew this was coming.

306
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:46.290
It will be harder than ever to
keep humanity from perishing.

307
00:24:47.858 --> 00:24:50.608
(dramatic music)

308
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.486

- It was a bumpy ride.

312
00:25:01.719 --> 00:25:03.543
And now I'm just settling.

313
00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:05.293
Gotta clear my head.

314
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.980
- Our entire solar system
was getting devoured

315
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.563
by a black hole.

316
00:25:13.652 --> 00:25:16.243
Barely got away.

317
00:25:16.243 --> 00:25:18.380
- My family! My children!

318
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.630
My husband. did you save them?

319
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.293
- There wasn't enough time.

320
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.133
Everyone on earth perished.

321
00:25:27.216 --> 00:25:31.583
- No! (sobbing)

322

326
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.233
- Illene.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.160
I'm Lieutenant Jenkins.

328
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.223

Please. hang in there. Illene. Okay?

330
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:00.741
Hang in there.

331
00:26:00.741 --> 00:26:02.074
(Illene sobbing)

332
00:26:02.074 --> 00:26:04.407
(whirring)

333
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.870
- Dear residents of this
international mothership.

334
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.460
I am so sorry for the many of your losses.

335
00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.480
Don't ever give up.

336
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.090
Your families wouldn't
have wanted that right now.

337
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.780
Even though we're at
such a huge loss of life.

338
00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.060
that doesn't mean we the people are safe.

339
00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.770
This ship must be maintained
until we can find a new home.

340
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.970
Everyone must do their
part for the greater good

341
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.030
of humanity.

342
00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.330
Again. I am sorry for everyone's losses.

343
00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.107
No one could have seen this coming.

344
00:26:53.901 --> 00:26:56.771
(gentle music)

345
00:26:56.771 --> 00:26:59.854
(footsteps tapping)

346
00:27:01.816 --> 00:27:02.816
- Roll call.

347
00:27:04.346 --> 00:27:05.179
Chow time.

348
00:27:06.929 --> 00:27:07.762
Line up.

349
00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.342
- This is nasty.

350
00:27:30.342 --> 00:27:33.509
- Gonna have to put something on this.

351
00:27:38.125 --> 00:27:40.792
(ominous music)

352
00:28:13.611 --> 00:28:16.611
(footsteps tapping)

353
00:28:18.118 --> 00:28:19.560
- Excuse me.

354
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.050
What did I just see you do?

355
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.343
I just seen you walk over to the machine.

356
00:28:24.393 --> 00:28:25.900
- Ah. nothing.

357
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.360
- Yeah. You walked over there.

358
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.720
What did you do? I seen what you did.

359
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.143
You stole all the herbs.

360
00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.530
- For seasoning.

361
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.740
- Yeah. Shut up. you.

362
00:28:40.004 --> 00:28:42.630
And you. put your food down right down.

363
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:46.993
Let's go.

364
00:28:49.441 --> 00:28:51.153
You. get up now.

365
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.750
Don't look at me like that.

366
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.543
Walk that way now.

367
00:28:59.128 --> 00:28:59.961
Keep walking.

368
00:29:04.566 --> 00:29:09.566
(bright classical music)
(diners chattering)

369
00:29:24.825 --> 00:29:28.060
(ominous music)

370
00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.980
- It looks like people
are eating at restaurants.

371
00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.270
- Nevermind. Keep going.

372
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:34.146
Go!

373
00:29:34.146 --> 00:29:37.210
(bright classical music)
(diners chattering)

374
00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:39.180
Don't worry about that.

375
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.013
Keep going.

376
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:44.443
Listen to me.

377
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.513
You keep walking down the hallway.

378
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.970
Keep going. I'll cuff you.

379
00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.147
Don't make me cuff you.

380
00:29:55.152 --> 00:29:57.549
(door whirring)

381
00:29:57.549 --> 00:30:00.299
(intense music)

382
00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:10.303
Keep walking. Miss Beckham.

383
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.053
Come on.

384
00:30:15.816 --> 00:30:19.670
- Mrs. Beckham. do you
know why you're here?

385
00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:22.177
- I'm not quite sure what you mean.

386
00:30:22.177 --> 00:30:24.840
- Why you were brought
here? Do you know why?

387
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.020
- No. I don't.

388
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.940
- You we're caught stealing.

389
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.540
Mrs. Beckham. let me
explain why that is a threat

390
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.333
to the upkeep of everyone's survival.

391
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.040
Every living thing on this ship

392
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.840
including the food we grow has a purpose.

393
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.200
It has a designated reason for being here

394
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.253
or for being grown here.

395
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:55.120
Even the smallest alteration
can have a ripple effect

396
00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.883
on our already fragile ecosystem.

397
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.193
Do you understand?

398
00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.560
You're taking of extra food.

399
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.320
even if it was just herbs.

400
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.040
can cause someone else to go without.

401
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.510
We need to work together

402
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:19.563
to ensure everyone has
what they need to survive.

403
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.700
- But what about those people I just saw

404
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.320
eating at restaurants?

405
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.016
They had salt and pepper on the table.

406
00:31:28.016 --> 00:31:31.350
- Oh. that's not real.

407
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.650
That's just another test site on the ship.

408
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.540
Tell you what. now that you know

409
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.610
you can't just pick from the rations

410
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:42.963
that feed the ship's populations.

411
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.563
you won't do it again. will you?

412
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.437
That is unless you want to
suffer the repercussions.

413
00:31:53.437 --> 00:31:56.230
- And what are the repercussions?

414
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.060
- I don't know.

415
00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.583
That would be up to what the jury decides.

416
00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.693
- So prepared.

417
00:32:05.366 --> 00:32:07.140
- Now you know.

418
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.940
The government put emergency
regulations in place

419
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.103
to address extreme situations.

420
00:32:20.597 --> 00:32:21.430
Jenkins.

421
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:24.623
- Ow!

422
00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.680
- Lieutenant Jenkins.

423
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.543
You're to report to boardroom 716.

424
00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.762
- Yes. sir.

425
00:32:36.762 --> 00:32:39.429
(ominous music)

426
00:32:41.536 --> 00:32:43.200
(all laughing)

427
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.617
(indistinct chattering)

428
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:49.750
Ma'am.

429
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:52.123
- How are your accommodations?

430
00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.143
- What?
- Aboard the ship?

431
00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.203
- My accommodations are fine. ma'am.

432
00:33:03.343 --> 00:33:05.760
(indistinct)

433
00:33:06.807 --> 00:33:09.518
(all chuckling)

434
00:33:09.518 --> 00:33:12.268
(ominous music)

435
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.947
Pay attention to the screen.

436
00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:25.367
We cannot be weak and show
sympathy for the help.

437
00:33:25.367 --> 00:33:28.284
(group chuckling)

438
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:32.620
They must work to sustain
not only themselves

439
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.766
but the comforts of us.

440
00:33:35.766 --> 00:33:38.150
(group chuckling)

441
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.503
And your family.

442
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.283
You see what is wrong with this picture?

443
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.380
Under no circumstances

444
00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.102
are you to take the
workers the scenic route.

445
00:33:57.102 --> 00:33:59.250
(group chuckling)

446
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:02.082
They are not to see that
we are more comfortable

447
00:34:02.082 --> 00:34:03.249
than they are.

448
00:34:05.456 --> 00:34:07.310
Pull another stunt like that

449
00:34:08.547 --> 00:34:12.528
and we will throw you and
your family out the airlock.

450
00:34:12.528 --> 00:34:15.278
(group laughing)

451
00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:19.241
(ominous music)

452
00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.603
So do me a favor.

453
00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.890
think of your family

454
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:29.843
next time you wanna show sympathy.

455
00:34:30.725 --> 00:34:33.558
(group laughing)

456
00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.500
- Yes. ma'am.

457
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.793
I meant. Miss.

458
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.893
- Don't just stand there.

459
00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:45.683
Get back to work.

460
00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:48.293
Commander.

461
00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:52.723
retrieve his sidearm.

462
00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.970
- Well. why?
- Give me your gun.

463
00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:01.803
- Why?

464
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.250
(gun clacks)

465
00:35:07.842 --> 00:35:10.743
- Now get out and get back to work.

466
00:35:10.743 --> 00:35:13.493
(ominous music)

467
00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.928
- How we are surviving in
this tin can is beyond me.

468
00:35:46.928 --> 00:35:49.050
- The fusion panel's
hanging on by a thread

469
00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.350
on the starboard side of the ship!

470
00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.928
Nikki. it needs emergency maintenance!

471
00:35:53.928 --> 00:35:55.819
- In what section?

472
00:35:55.819 --> 00:35:58.970
- Sections S1. S14.

473
00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.863
shit. and S32!

474
00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:07.862
- Line everyone up.

475
00:36:07.862 --> 00:36:10.529
(intense music)

476
00:37:03.735 --> 00:37:07.472
- Do you even know what our
destination is. anyways?

477
00:37:07.472 --> 00:37:08.389
- No clue.

478
00:37:09.459 --> 00:37:11.151
- Good day. Mr President.

479
00:37:11.151 --> 00:37:13.930
(dramatic music)

480
00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.370
- We really don't have
much time for formalities.

481
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.268
Does anyone have any
plans for our destination?

482
00:37:19.268 --> 00:37:20.823
- Well there lies the problem.

483
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.363
Due to the direction which our
solar system was destroyed.

484
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.990
we went in the opposite direction

485
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.553
of our nearest solar
system. Alpha Centauri.

486
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.300
which we would have arrived
in just a few months

487
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.447
had we gone in that direction.

488
00:37:37.759 --> 00:37:39.920
- Can we turn this ship around?

489
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.600
- We would be heading
in the same direction

490
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.533
as the black hole.

491
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.000
We have no way of gauging
its gravitational pull.

492
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.180
- There's other avenues
we need to discuss.

493
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.020
- Go on.

494
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.542
- Well we're gonna still need
as far as where we're heading.

495
00:37:55.542 --> 00:37:56.375
if we wanna keep the ship up

496
00:37:56.375 --> 00:37:58.940
through the next couple of years. decades.

497
00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.070
or even centuries.

498
00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.890
we need to talk about controlled breeding

499
00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.710
and systematic training.

500
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.796
- Are you saying we may never
reach a habitable planet

501
00:38:06.796 --> 00:38:07.859
in our lifetime?

502
00:38:07.859 --> 00:38:10.003
(dramatic music)

503
00:38:10.003 --> 00:38:13.380
- I don't know but we need to
be prepared for the unknown.

504
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.360
If you look around.
the ship needs repairs.

505
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.600
you know. inside and out.

506
00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.490
As we speak. we have people on the outside

507
00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:19.630
that are working at fixing it up.

508
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.623
Again. I honestly don't know how long

509
00:38:21.623 --> 00:38:23.233
it's gonna last. Mr. President.

510
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.343
- That is enough. John Leaf.

511
00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.060
We will stay ahead of the situation.

512
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.357
We will send a memo of our
complete plan of the action.

513
00:38:36.824 --> 00:38:39.491
(intense music)

514
00:38:49.415 --> 00:38:51.582
(hissing)

515
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:53.859
- What is that?

516
00:38:55.525 --> 00:38:57.775
(whirring)

517
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.350
Oh my God. Asteroids!

518
00:39:07.275 --> 00:39:08.858
Take care of them!

519
00:39:10.255 --> 00:39:12.505
(whirring)

520
00:39:14.977 --> 00:39:18.227
(thunderous explosion)

521
00:39:20.328 --> 00:39:23.578
(thunderous explosion)

522
00:39:28.849 --> 00:39:32.435
(distorted voice)

523
00:39:32.435 --> 00:39:35.583
- You gotta get yourself
to the nearest hatch now!

524
00:39:35.583 --> 00:39:38.333
(intense music)

525
00:39:51.085 --> 00:39:52.242
- What was that?

526
00:39:52.242 --> 00:39:54.060
(ominous music)

527
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.680
- We are still receiving reports

528
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.050
from the engineering department.

529
00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.590
The one thing I can tell you

530
00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.445
is we have passed through
an asteroid field.

531
00:40:02.445 --> 00:40:07.445
(intense music)
(distorted voices)

532
00:40:28.051 --> 00:40:30.801
(doors hissing)

533
00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.710
- Guys we're losing power left and right!

534
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.030
Sections are disappearing as we speak!

535
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.084
There's all kind of...

536
00:40:48.084 --> 00:40:50.751
(intense music)

537
00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:00.310
- Everyone says taking
this ship is a mistake.

538
00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:02.910
- What are you talking about?

539
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.547
- Don't you think it's shady how this ship

540
00:41:05.547 --> 00:41:07.333
was built in secret?

541
00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:11.203
With the capability of wiping
out our whole solar system?

542
00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:15.236
- I admit. it's a little convenient.

543
00:41:15.236 --> 00:41:16.640
- Shh!

544
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.400
The security will hear you.

545
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.870
That's another thing.

546
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.360
We have armed guards
watching our every move

547
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.823
like we're in prison.

548
00:41:25.915 --> 00:41:28.893
- Nikki. aren't you being
a little paranoid here?

549
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.890
- Open your fucking eyes!

550
00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:35.303
I seen something different
out on the spacewalk.

551
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.790
You see the shitty food
they're feeding us.

552
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:40.700
those tight dorm rooms we're living in.

553
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.000
I saw something different
outside of the ship.

554
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.780
We're slaves!

555
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.116
Come on. man. What are
we gonna do about it?

556
00:41:51.116 --> 00:41:53.191
We lost our whole entire family.

557
00:41:53.191 --> 00:41:56.024
(dramatic music)

558
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.595
- What was that all about?

559
00:42:22.595 --> 00:42:24.410
- We can't even move up.

560
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:25.410
- You're kidding me.

561
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:30.870
- They're secure while we suffer!

562
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.219
And our families are gone!

563
00:42:33.219 --> 00:42:35.427
(sobbing)

564
00:42:35.427 --> 00:42:38.070
(intense music)

565
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.610
- I need Intel.

566
00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.690
I need to know where these
messages are coming from.

567
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.070
And I need to know now!

568
00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.810
- For a short while our
communications were scrambled

569
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:51.423
but our private programmers
have fixed all the issues.

570
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:55.730
- Where are the messages coming from?

571
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:59.733
- I said. the communication
scramble was fixed!

572
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:03.720
We don't know the location of the origin.

573
00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.373
- More oxygen comes from
the botanical sector.

574
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.040
and then it's pushed
through the rest of the ship

575
00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.220
by the engineering department.

576
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.120
- My entire family just
watched their lives

577
00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.880
being interrupted on a televised
broadcast on this ship.

578
00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.190
What the hell is going on here?

579
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:18.080
The entire upper class
- Mr. President.

580
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.602
was in a panic.
- we have the best-

581
00:43:19.602 --> 00:43:21.750
- Group workers are not happy.

582
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.500
My suggestion is that we negotiate.

583
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.914
- John Leaf. we do not
negotiate with terrorists.

584
00:43:25.914 --> 00:43:27.090
- Mrs. McMichaels. is there something

585
00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:29.020
that can be done
peacefully to resolve this?

586
00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.211
- May I suggest. Mr. President. that we-

587
00:43:31.211 --> 00:43:32.088
- What is your name. sir?

588
00:43:32.088 --> 00:43:34.138
- My name. Mr. President.

589
00:43:34.138 --> 00:43:36.280
- Ruin the course of justice.
- is John Leaf.

590
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.280
Lives are at stake!

591
00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.238
- Which will be dealt with swiftly.

592
00:43:40.238 --> 00:43:42.988
(intense music)

593
00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.430
I would need you to

594
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.527
grant a seek and destroy
initiative. Mr. President.

595
00:43:53.527 --> 00:43:57.859
if you'd like these
pests to be eradicated.

596
00:43:57.859 --> 00:44:00.609
(intense music)

597
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.130
- We will go with Mr. Leaf's suggestion.

598
00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.523
- You're all dismissed.

599
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.660
Except for you.

600
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.410
(intense music)

601
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:42.093
You served with my father at the Pentagon.

602
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:44.920
- Yes. ma'am.

603
00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.970
Sorry he couldn't make it
as one of the survivors

604
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.264
on this ship.
- Yes.

605
00:44:50.264 --> 00:44:52.013
it was a real loss.

606
00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:58.623
I need you to dispose of somebody for me.

607
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:02.373
- Consider it done.

608
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:09.709
- Make it look like an act of terrorists.

609
00:45:09.709 --> 00:45:11.709
- Do you know who it is?

610
00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:15.584
- John Leaf.

611
00:45:15.584 --> 00:45:18.251
(ominous music)

612
00:45:22.272 --> 00:45:24.855
(ice clinking)

613
00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:11.487
(pump clicks)

614
00:46:11.487 --> 00:46:14.518
(gun clattering)

615
00:46:14.518 --> 00:46:15.351
(pot bangs)

616
00:46:15.351 --> 00:46:18.018
(intense music)

617
00:46:37.715 --> 00:46:40.132
(neck snaps)

618
00:46:46.255 --> 00:46:48.672
(body thuds)

619
00:47:01.842 --> 00:47:04.509
(doors hissing)

620
00:47:05.655 --> 00:47:08.322
(intense music)

621
00:47:11.964 --> 00:47:14.631
(doors hissing)

622
00:47:19.922 --> 00:47:21.528
(machinery whirring)

623
00:47:21.528 --> 00:47:23.840
- You finally get to see what happens

624
00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.173
when people break the rules.

625
00:47:28.946 --> 00:47:30.376
- No. no!
- What's going on here?

626
00:47:30.376 --> 00:47:31.526
- No!
- No!

627
00:47:31.526 --> 00:47:33.101
- Stop!
- What's going on?

628
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:34.324
- No. stop!
- Let her go.

629
00:47:34.324 --> 00:47:35.468
This isn't right.
- What are you doing?

630
00:47:35.468 --> 00:47:36.307
Let her go.
- Quiet.

631
00:47:36.307 --> 00:47:37.650
Come on.

632
00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:39.366
- Let her go. no!
- This isn't fair.

633
00:47:39.366 --> 00:47:40.549
- Don't do this.

634
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:42.089
(indistinct)

635
00:47:42.089 --> 00:47:43.677
- No. let her go!

636
00:47:43.677 --> 00:47:46.427
(intense music)

637
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:48.693
- Wait.

638
00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:53.670
I want Lieutenant Jenkins to do the deed.

639
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.420
(intense music)

640
00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:02.280
- Lieutenant Jenkins.

641
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.790
Front and center.

642
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:10.437
- Yes. sir.

643
00:48:10.437 --> 00:48:13.245
(machinery whirring)

644
00:48:13.245 --> 00:48:16.245
(suspenseful music)

645
00:48:17.448 --> 00:48:18.800
- Your sidearm.

646
00:48:21.497 --> 00:48:23.113
- Please don't do this.

647
00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.713
- Lieutenant Jenkins.

648
00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.050
I want you to repeat after me

649
00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:32.903
and listen very carefully.

650
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:39.400
To those involved in acts of terrorism

651
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.534
against our communications system.

652
00:48:42.534 --> 00:48:45.604
(Illene sobbing)

653
00:48:45.604 --> 00:48:48.353
- To those that were involved

654
00:48:48.353 --> 00:48:52.460
- Please. don't do this!
- in acts of terrorism

655
00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.763
against our communications system.

656
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:59.073
This is how we negotiate.

657
00:49:01.548 --> 00:49:04.214
- Please don't.

658
00:49:04.214 --> 00:49:05.679
- Everyone against the wall!
- Against the wall!

659
00:49:05.679 --> 00:49:07.116
- Whoa. whoa. whoa!
- Against the wall!

660
00:49:07.116 --> 00:49:09.356
- Move it!
- Whoa. whoa. whoa!

661
00:49:09.356 --> 00:49:11.089
- You motherfucker.
Get down. motherfucker.

662
00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:12.275
Get down.
- Oh. oh!

663
00:49:12.275 --> 00:49:14.093
- No!
- Get on your knees.

664
00:49:14.093 --> 00:49:15.245
- No. don't.

665
00:49:15.245 --> 00:49:17.395
- For those of you
committing acts of terrorism

666
00:49:17.395 --> 00:49:19.067
against our communications system.

667
00:49:19.067 --> 00:49:21.100
this is how we do business.

668
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.519
- Please sir. don't!
- Don't. no!

669
00:49:22.519 --> 00:49:23.933
- I didn't do anything. please!

670
00:49:23.933 --> 00:49:24.997
- Shut up.

671
00:49:24.997 --> 00:49:27.968
We don't negotiate with terrorists.

672
00:49:27.968 --> 00:49:29.837
To those of you committing
acts of terrorism

673
00:49:29.837 --> 00:49:31.922
against this communications network.

674
00:49:31.922 --> 00:49:33.342
this is how we do business.

675
00:49:33.342 --> 00:49:34.609
- Please sir. don't!
- You don't have to do this.

676
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:35.442
- Shut up.
- I didn't do anything!

677
00:49:35.442 --> 00:49:37.230
Please!
- Now let this young man

678
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:39.210
be an example to what'll happen

679
00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:41.344
if you put us in jeopardy on this shop.

680
00:49:41.344 --> 00:49:42.232
- Goddamn!

681
00:49:42.232 --> 00:49:43.455
(gun fires)

682
00:49:43.455 --> 00:49:46.122
(intense music)

683
00:49:49.306 --> 00:49:51.479
- This is how we negotiate.

684
00:49:51.479 --> 00:49:53.646
(sobbing)

685
00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:57.773
- Now kill the prisoner.

686
00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.888
- I can't do this.

687
00:50:06.888 --> 00:50:08.550
I can't do this.

688
00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:09.700
- Please don't kill me.

689
00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.340
- Remember our brief
conversation from before?

690
00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:20.520
I will throw you and your
family out of the air lock

691
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.513
like yesterday's garbage.

692
00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:24.927
- I can't do this.
- You will follow orders.

693
00:50:24.927 --> 00:50:26.400
- Please don't kill me.

694
00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.148
- Now kill that prisoner!

695
00:50:29.148 --> 00:50:30.550
- Please.

696
00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:31.450
I don't wanna die.

697
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:38.620
- Security. go retrieve
Lieutenant Jenkins family

698
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:41.407
and escort them to the air lock.

699
00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:43.610
- No. wait!

700
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:45.655
Wait. I'll do it.

701
00:50:45.655 --> 00:50:47.098
- Please.
- I'll do it.

702
00:50:47.098 --> 00:50:49.971
- Please. please.
- Don't look at me!

703
00:50:49.971 --> 00:50:50.999
(fist whacks)

704
00:50:50.999 --> 00:50:53.749
(dramatic music)

705
00:51:04.289 --> 00:51:05.122
(gun fires)
(Illene screams)

706
00:51:05.122 --> 00:51:07.872
(Illene sobbing)

707
00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.888
- Good job. lieutenant.

708
00:51:14.888 --> 00:51:17.638
(dramatic music)

709
00:51:19.726 --> 00:51:21.726
- Illene. I am so sorry.

710
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:25.010
I'm sorry. Illene.

711
00:51:41.313 --> 00:51:44.589
(machine whirring)

712
00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:47.422
(dramatic music)

713
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.008
- Taking a stand tonight.

714
00:52:08.008 --> 00:52:09.643
- I don't think you should do it.

715
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:12.183
- I can't live like this.

716
00:52:13.286 --> 00:52:16.437
- I don't think you should do it.

717
00:52:16.437 --> 00:52:17.603
- I want in.

718
00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:23.438
They killed my best friend
because of something I did!

719
00:52:23.438 --> 00:52:26.271
(dramatic music)

720
00:52:33.877 --> 00:52:37.490
- You see. Mr. President.
everything is back in order.

721
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:38.503
- Where is Mr. Leaf?

722
00:52:38.503 --> 00:52:41.336
(dramatic music)

723
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:46.620
- Unfortunately. there
was a terrorist attack

724
00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:49.067
in the living quarters.

725
00:52:49.067 --> 00:52:51.150
He could not be revived.

726
00:52:52.216 --> 00:52:56.113
However. we did negotiate
with the terrorists.

727
00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:59.913
We came to an agreement.

728
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.873
We are all safe now.

729
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:08.680
That is all you need to know.

730
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.634
- Excuse me. ID.

731
00:53:16.634 --> 00:53:19.482
(machines whirring)

732
00:53:19.482 --> 00:53:22.232
(ominous music)

733
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.890
- The west wing. There's a bridge.

734
00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:28.862
She's here for maintenance.

735
00:53:28.862 --> 00:53:30.428
- Hmm.

736
00:53:30.428 --> 00:53:33.750

737
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:34.583
Go.

738
00:53:40.054 --> 00:53:43.650
- So what's your plan? Is
your team working on anything?

739
00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:46.590
- My team is working on assets passed

740
00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:50.383
for corporates data bridge sheets.

741
00:53:51.364 --> 00:53:53.382
- Why can't we just turn up the air?

742
00:53:53.382 --> 00:53:55.043
- Because that would be complicated.

743
00:53:55.043 --> 00:53:57.623
We can only shut it
down for a little while.

744
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:01.517
No. we have to get the people

745
00:54:01.517 --> 00:54:03.367
who are actually pulling the strings.

746
00:54:04.442 --> 00:54:06.524
- We have to pull the strings.

747
00:54:06.524 --> 00:54:07.673
- Yeah. We do.

748
00:54:07.673 --> 00:54:10.899
(intense music)

749
00:54:10.899 --> 00:54:12.260
- What do you have in there?

750
00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.927
- It's walkie-talkies
so we can communicate.

751
00:54:20.171 --> 00:54:21.988
Make sure you communicate with this.

752
00:54:21.988 --> 00:54:23.571
- Yes. I have mine.

753
00:54:30.847 --> 00:54:32.853
- You two are awfully chatty.

754
00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.530
Miss Beckham. you know the rules.

755
00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:39.380
Get back to work.

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:42.944
Or do you wanna wind up-

757
00:54:42.944 --> 00:54:45.527
- Like my best friend you shot?

758
00:54:48.228 --> 00:54:49.728
- I had my orders.

759
00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:52.470
Just get back to work.

760
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:56.767
I wouldn't wanna wind up like her too.

761
00:54:58.883 --> 00:55:00.617
- Get out of my way.

762
00:55:00.617 --> 00:55:03.284
(intense music)

763
00:55:05.894 --> 00:55:07.061
- Here you go.

764
00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:09.340
- So here's the plan.

765
00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.900
You guys are gonna power
down the security system

766
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.550
which will give us about an
hour to take out our oppressors.

767
00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:18.234
Team two is gonna take out the boardroom.

768
00:55:18.234 --> 00:55:21.265

what are you planning?

769
00:55:21.265 --> 00:55:23.492
- I have my own secret assignment.

770
00:55:23.492 --> 00:55:24.967
- But what are you planning on doing?

771
00:55:24.967 --> 00:55:26.384
- It's a secret.

772
00:55:28.524 --> 00:55:30.357
Everybody get to work.

773
00:55:31.197 --> 00:55:32.430
Illene. you there?

- Get you and your team
to a secure location.

During the food run.

777
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:44.400

788
00:56:27.061 --> 00:56:29.728

Okay. he's down.

Now what?

791
00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:47.110
- Now we must discuss the
building of our new structure

792
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:48.940
from the meteor debris that was salvaged

793
00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:51.852
from being lodged in our ship.

794
00:56:51.852 --> 00:56:53.630
(door hissing)

795
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:57.163
May I suggest a new probe launching area?

What may I help you with?

797
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:07.920
- Yes. there's a couple
of people on the ship

798
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.680
trying to do some stuff.

799
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:14.603
- Well if this is true. excuse my French.

800
00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:18.053
but they're fucking stupid.

801
00:57:19.357 --> 00:57:21.230
- No. no. there's a couple of people

802
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.174
trying to take over the ship.

803
00:57:23.174 --> 00:57:26.187
And murdered a couple
of people on the ship.

804
00:57:26.187 --> 00:57:27.312
- Tell me everything.

805
00:57:27.312 --> 00:57:30.062
(dramatic music)

806
00:57:38.265 --> 00:57:39.520
(groaning)

807
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.187

808
00:57:49.281 --> 00:57:50.941

811
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:04.873
(gasping) Let me go!

812
00:58:09.151 --> 00:58:11.320
Don't kill me. I have family.

813
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.570
- But Jan said those exact
same words and shot her!

814
00:58:18.113 --> 00:58:19.803
This is too easy.

815
00:58:22.347 --> 00:58:24.723
- Look. let me go.

816
00:58:26.161 --> 00:58:30.803
and I won't retaliate
or file a report on ya.

817
00:58:30.803 --> 00:58:33.720

00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:36.943
Either you die or your family dies!

819
00:58:36.943 --> 00:58:37.776
- What?

820
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.933
What kind of choices is that?

821
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:46.563
They made me kill your friends.

822
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:49.493
I'm sorry.

823
00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.540
Please.

824
00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:54.678
Don't make me choose. Don't.

825
00:58:54.678 --> 00:58:55.788
- Go get.

Don't. don't!

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:04.507
No.

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:07.610
(dramatic music)

832
00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:08.443
Wait!

833
00:59:10.371 --> 00:59:11.288
I'll do it.

834
00:59:12.807 --> 00:59:14.807
I'll die for my family.

835
00:59:16.757 --> 00:59:18.740
- I figured you would say that.

836
00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:20.950
That's why my team is
on the way to get them.

837
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:22.493
So you can say goodbye!

838
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.883

839
00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.623
A thank you to your friend.

840
00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:37.950
- You're a fool!

841
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:40.810
You need us to sustain the ship!

842
00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:41.990
- There are some of you.

843
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:44.563
Not putting everyone's lives at stake.

844
00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:49.383
Anyway. we don't need people like you.

845
00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:54.713
Anyway. hold your breath.

846
00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:02.060
You can thank the workers.

Don't do this.

877
01:02:15.351 --> 01:02:18.184
(dramatic music)

878
01:02:25.550 --> 01:02:29.333
- The terrorist numbers were
larger than we anticipated.

879

The president is dead!

883
01:02:54.057 --> 01:02:57.810

I want everyone to get
into their rightful places.
