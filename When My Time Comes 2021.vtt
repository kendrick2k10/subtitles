3
00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:38.372
What is death?

4
00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:40.874
How will my own life end?

5
00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:44.145
What options do I have.

6
00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:48.816
if any. as to
what my death will be like?

7
00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:55.022
Artists. philosophers.
writers. people like you

8
00:00:55.055 --> 00:01:00.194
and me have been considering
questions like these for. well.

9
00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:05.299
for as long as there
have been human beings.

10
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:12.540
Today. some of us are willing to
speak openly about such things.

11
00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:15.643
but many of us are not.

12
00:01:16.544 --> 00:01:18.946
We live in a.
in a culture that seems

13
00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.182
to hide from mortality.

14
00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:23.317
This is the
most difficult experience for

15
00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:25.586
a patient.
and their families.

16
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.088
Speaking
about death and dying is

17
00:01:28.122 --> 00:01:29.623
complicated for people.

18
00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:33.194
And it takes a certain amount
of willingness to be vulnerable.

19
00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:39.066
These conversations
are not actually about dying.

20
00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:42.603
They're about the
quality of our lives.

21
00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:47.441
Everybody's ideal is
to die quickly in their sleep

22
00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:50.278
and not have any
existential suffering.

23
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:53.013
But that's not
available to many of us.

24
00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:58.619
25% of people who
die with chronic illness.

25
00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.888
die with uncontrolled pain.

26
00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:04.124
I'm going
to die of breast cancer. right.

27
00:02:04.158 --> 00:02:06.627
One of the scariest
things about that is.

28
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.862
is that you have no control.

29
00:02:09.397 --> 00:02:12.733
But you can
control the end of life.

30
00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.134
How I die.

31
00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:17.271
I can control how I die.

32
00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:22.109
Medical aid in dying is a
medical treatment that enables

33
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:27.114
a person who is dying. who
has exhausted all hope for cure

34
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.850
and is close to
an imminent death;

35
00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:34.255
help them die in comfort.

36
00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:37.991
in peace and with
reduced level of suffering.

37
00:02:40.428 --> 00:02:43.096
When somebody
is thinking about aid in dying.

38
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.133
they're not
thinking about it casually.

39
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.868
I think this is
a very difficult debate for

40
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.370
a lot of people.

41
00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:51.605
Some people don't
feel it's an appropriate thing

42
00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.241
for a doctor to do.

43
00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:55.075
I don't know
whether I would use it.

44
00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:58.212
but I know I'd
like to have the choice.

45
00:02:59.447 --> 00:03:02.716
This is between
an individual and her family

46
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.951
and doctor.

47
00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:06.153
A good
conversation goes...

48
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.455
A long way.

49
00:03:07.488 --> 00:03:10.190
Right.
but it's a hard one.

50
00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.596
Most people would
rather not talk about death.

51
00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:20.234
They'd rather push
it out of their minds.

52
00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:24.171
But I believe we
must talk about it.

53
00:03:25.473 --> 00:03:31.412
For me. thinking about
what I would like to have at

54
00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:35.148
the end of my life
is very important.

55
00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:42.089
And sharing my wishes
with my family. my friends.

56
00:03:43.257 --> 00:03:49.630
my physician. I believe
will bring comfort to us all

57
00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:51.699
when my time comes.

58
00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:07.948
I want to tell
you about John Rehm.

59
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:11.985
my husband of 54 years.

60
00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.022
He was a fine man.
self-confident.

61
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.991
with a wonderful mind.

62
00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:23.397
He was knowledgeable
about so many things and John

63
00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:26.133
was a born teacher.

64
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:31.405
She hadn't been
to college and she really went

65
00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:36.310
to the John Rehm graduate
school and learned an awful lot.

66
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.647
He was brilliant.

67
00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:45.419
John Rehm was thrilled with
every step of Diane's career.

68
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.223
He was just so supportive
of everything she did.

69
00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:55.996
John Rehm
retired at age 71.

70
00:04:56.797 --> 00:05:01.301
and he would wait for
me to come home so we could

71
00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:04.438
go for a long walk
around the neighborhood.

72
00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:11.845
It was in 2004.

73
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:19.787
on those walks that I began
to hear John Rehm shuffle.

74
00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:24.792
As the years went on.
he became thinner and thinner

75
00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:28.228
and then his hands
began to tremor.

76
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:33.266
So he knew
something was wrong.

77
00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:38.171
John was suffering
from Parkinson's.

78
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.044
Parkinson's Disease is a
progressive disorder of

79
00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:46.079
the nervous system.

80
00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:48.682
And some people.
like my husband.

81
00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:52.720
can develop complications
that result in death.

82
00:05:54.955 --> 00:06:00.494
John and I began to talk
about his declining health and

83
00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:06.400
the possibility that he would
die much sooner than I would.

84
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.170
Ready when you are.

85
00:06:10.538 --> 00:06:14.775
On my radio program.
just as in my life.

86
00:06:15.142 --> 00:06:18.245
I never shied
away from tough subjects

87
00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:22.149
and neither did John Rehm.

88
00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:27.888
On my mind this week.
medical aid in dying.

89
00:06:28.656 --> 00:06:32.125
Some call it
"death with dignity"

90
00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:35.829
or "physician assisted dying."

91
00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:38.899
It has different names.

92
00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:43.537
I had been aware of
this movement in the U.S. and

93
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:47.775
was favorably inclined
toward it. generally speaking.

94
00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:55.516
My darling John died
in 2014 and that experience

95
00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:59.587
made this issue very personal.

96
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.923
I realized I still
had a lot to learn.

97
00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:09.963
I decided I should
do what I do best.

98
00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:15.435
investigate this
subject and learn the facts.

99
00:07:17.404 --> 00:07:18.872
You can
decide to stop chemotherapy.

100
00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:21.408
you can decide to have
surgery on your aorta or not.

101
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:26.013
One of the first
experts I spoke with was

102
00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:32.185
Dr. Lonny Shavelson. a
physician who has been focused

103
00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:36.423
on end of life care
for over three decades.

104
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:40.093
Probably one of the
driving forces for me to become

105
00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:43.931
a doctor was. was dealing
with the question of suffering.

106
00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:46.734
especially around the
time of Jack Kevorkian

107
00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:48.602
in the early '90s.

108
00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:51.839
I think that people started
really talking about this.

109
00:07:51.872 --> 00:07:54.207
He was a retired
pathologist from Michigan who

110
00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:56.744
specialized in
challenging authority.

111
00:07:56.777 --> 00:08:00.313
Dr. Jack Kevorkian ignited
a national debate in the 1990s

112
00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:03.551
over physician
assisted suicide.

113
00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:07.287
when he helped more than
130 patients kill themselves.

114
00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.389
Many
doctors agree with me.

115
00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:10.891
but they're
intimidated into silence.

116
00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:14.294
I am lucky to be in a position
where I don't have to be silent.

117
00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:19.066
People weren't aware
there was a problem until the

118
00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:23.403
extremity of his activities
brought it to light.

119
00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:26.974
how desperate
people were to prevent.

120
00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.376
avoid end of life suffering.

121
00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:32.212
It made me
really realize that there was

122
00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:33.747
a bigger picture.

123
00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:36.149
that it was important
for me to look into it.

124
00:08:36.183 --> 00:08:40.487
to understand it better and
to really get into the idea of.

125
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.258
in what was still then a
hidden world of people asking

126
00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:46.994
to die because of
illness and suffering.

127
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.464
When John was dying.

128
00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:54.768
he could no
longer walk on his own.

129
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.906
he could no longer
stand on his own.

130
00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:03.110
he could no
longer feed himself.

131
00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:08.782
The doctor at the nursing
home had said he was within

132
00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:13.520
six months of dying.
because he had lost so much

133
00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:21.328
of his human capacity
except the capacity to think.

134
00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.332
He could think very clearly.

135
00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:29.469
And John turned to
the doctor and said.

136
00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:35.776
I am ready to die and
I want you to help me.

137
00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:39.546
And the doctor said.

138
00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:43.316
here in the
state of Maryland.

139
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.554
I have not the
legal authority.

140
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:51.424
the moral authority or

141
00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:57.898
any other authority
by which to help you die.

142
00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:02.435
The only way

143
00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:08.541
you can
do this is to stop eating.

144
00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:14.648
stop drinking water.
stop taking medication.

145
00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:20.587
And John. for the
first time in a long time.

146
00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:24.658
became enraged.

147
00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:32.032
By the early 1990s.
some people. patients.

148
00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:37.070
physicians and
even some lawmakers.

149
00:10:37.104 --> 00:10:42.042
were beginning to look at
what could be done legislatively

150
00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:47.114
to address end of life
suffering in the United States.

151
00:10:49.717 --> 00:10:54.154
The state of Oregon was at
the center of that movement.

152
00:10:56.189 --> 00:10:59.626
There had been multiple
attempts in the legislatures

153
00:11:00.728 --> 00:11:02.863
of the nation
to introduce a bill.

154
00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:05.598
None of those bills
ever went anywhere.

155
00:11:05.632 --> 00:11:09.536
But we rolled up our
sleeves and crafted a bill

156
00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:15.608
that we believed would satisfy
people's concerns about safety.

157
00:11:16.977 --> 00:11:20.147
eligibility criteria
that were crystal clear.

158
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.883
These are for
mentally capable.

159
00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:26.553
terminally ill adults
who are well informed of all

160
00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:28.722
their end of life options.

161
00:11:28.756 --> 00:11:30.590
Because it's a
medical procedure.

162
00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:33.193
it conforms to the
standards of medical care.

163
00:11:33.226 --> 00:11:38.732
Now there are a
great many people who point to

164
00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:43.636
Oregon's law as the standard by

165
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.007
which all the
others then followed.

166
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:50.878
Oregon came online
in November of 1997.

167
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:52.345
Right.

168
00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:56.249
There was not another law
passed until November of 2008.

169
00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:57.785
Oh. wow.

170
00:11:57.818 --> 00:12:01.154
We were having trouble
making process in other states.

171
00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:05.292
until Brittany Maynard
came on the scene in

172
00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:09.729
the waning days of 2014.

173
00:12:11.965 --> 00:12:15.035
Brittany was
an adventurous spirit.

174
00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:17.805
She was a force of nature.

175
00:12:17.838 --> 00:12:20.573
would be a good way to
describe her personality.

176
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.848
Brittany and I. we got
married in September of 2012.

177
00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:31.751
And a few months
after our wedding.

178
00:12:31.785 --> 00:12:34.287
she started having headaches.

179
00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:36.623
They would wake her up
in the middle of the night.

180
00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:41.728
Dan told me that by
the summer they knew something

181
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:44.264
was seriously wrong.

182
00:12:45.198 --> 00:12:48.235
I was told I
had a grade two astrocytoma

183
00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:51.071
and was told
anywhere from three.

184
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.841
maybe five. up to
ten years to live.

185
00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:55.708
I have to tell you.
when you're 29 years old.

186
00:12:55.742 --> 00:12:58.145
being told you have
that kind of timeline still

187
00:12:58.178 --> 00:13:00.580
feels like you're being told
you're going to die tomorrow.

188
00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:04.251
70 days post-op. I
went in for another MRI.

189
00:13:05.585 --> 00:13:07.921
and was told I
had had a grade change.

190
00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:11.724
They were looking and saying
it looks like grade four.

191
00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:14.661
which is the worst and most
aggressive form of brain cancer.

192
00:13:15.562 --> 00:13:18.165
It's called a glioblastoma.

193
00:13:18.198 --> 00:13:22.102
So that was a major shock to
my system and the system of my

194
00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:25.005
family because it went
from having potentially years

195
00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:27.740
of time to being told
I had like six months.

196
00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:30.410
Brittany told me.

197
00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:33.713
we will continue
to fight this tumor.

198
00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:38.018
but if it gets bad.
we're moving to Oregon.

199
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.721
Oregon's Death
with Dignity Program

200
00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:44.057
was something that
she had come across.

201
00:13:46.894 --> 00:13:50.197
She decided that she
would do what she could with

202
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.767
the time she had remaining
to pave the way so that other

203
00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:57.470
Californians wouldn't
have to do what she did.

204
00:13:58.205 --> 00:14:01.041
and she was
enormously effective.

205
00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:04.377
The freedom of
this patient right is choice.

206
00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:09.116
100 million people
worldwide had seen her.

207
00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:12.052
knew her name and
knew what she stood for.

208
00:14:12.986 --> 00:14:14.821
And we have
our own conversation now

209
00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.023
with Barbara Coombs Lee.

210
00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:18.025
president of
Compassion and Choices.

211
00:14:18.058 --> 00:14:20.793
the group dedicated to
expanding end of life options

212
00:14:20.827 --> 00:14:22.862
that's now working
with Brittany Maynard.

213
00:14:22.896 --> 00:14:25.265
And Dr. Ira Byock
is director of the

214
00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:26.900
Institute for Human Caring

215
00:14:26.934 --> 00:14:28.868
of Providence
Health and Services.

216
00:14:28.902 --> 00:14:31.738
a palliative care physician
and author of the book.

217
00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:33.473
"The Best Care Possible".

218
00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:35.775
Well. Barbara Coombs Lee.
let me start with you.

219
00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:38.511
Why do you think the
case of Brittany Maynard

220
00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.480
is resonating
with so many people?

221
00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:41.848
What's the key to this for you?

222
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.120
The key is how
Brittany has made dying real.

223
00:14:47.154 --> 00:14:49.656
made the
tragedy of. of decline.

224
00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:51.491
the inhumanities that people

225
00:14:51.524 --> 00:14:54.694
suffer often before their
disease takes their lives.

226
00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:57.830
Brittany is bringing
that reality home to people.

227
00:14:57.864 --> 00:15:00.533
My heart goes
out to Brittany Maynard.

228
00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.735
It's a heart wrenching story.

229
00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:05.238
But I want to assure the.
our people watching that

230
00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:09.209
she could get excellent
whole person care

231
00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:13.446
and be assured of
dying gently in her bed.

232
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.548
surrounded by her family.

233
00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:20.020
Giving doctors now authority to
write lethal prescriptions fixes

234
00:15:20.053 --> 00:15:22.555
really nothing. none of the
deficiencies in practice or

235
00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:26.426
medical training. it's really a
socially dangerous thing to do.

236
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.796
Barbara Coombs Lee. a
socially dangerous thing to do?

237
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:32.232
In other words. it might
work in one individual case.

238
00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.334
for Brittany Maynard.
but expanded.

239
00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:36.069
it doesn't make sense
is the argument.

240
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.241
It makes sense for a lot of
people and I think that I agree

241
00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:43.276
with Dr. Byock and
he knows that I do.

242
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.146
Hospice and palliative
care is the gold standard.

243
00:15:46.179 --> 00:15:49.049
It's wonderful.
But it's not a miracle.

244
00:15:49.082 --> 00:15:53.953
And it cannot prevent the kind
of relentless. dehumanizing.

245
00:15:53.987 --> 00:15:56.356
horrific decline
that Brittany faces.

246
00:15:57.624 --> 00:16:01.528
Brittany Maynard was
able to do that and she's in

247
00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:03.196
many ways. a role model.

248
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.264
She's a...

249
00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:06.899
Moving from
California to Oregon?

250
00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:08.668
To Oregon.

251
00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:13.873
It means that you have to
have the wherewithal to uproot

252
00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:16.509
yourself and your
family. your caregivers.

253
00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:21.314
So that takes it out of
the option for many people.

254
00:16:25.552 --> 00:16:30.390
There are people who
feel so strongly. as John did.

255
00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:40.367
that control is what they want
as to when it ends. how it ends.

256
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:48.208
But sadly. John was too
ill to travel to Oregon.

257
00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:52.512
as Brittany Maynard had done.

258
00:16:55.948 --> 00:17:00.019
I came in with a
photograph album.

259
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.825
I sat on his bed and we looked
at the photographs together.

260
00:17:07.994 --> 00:17:12.099
And he said. Diane. I
have not had any food.

261
00:17:12.132 --> 00:17:17.070
I have not had any medication.
I have not had any water.

262
00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:23.276
I have begun the journey.

263
00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:27.414
He had a smile on his face.

264
00:17:27.447 --> 00:17:34.487
And I believe it was because
he had taken his life back into

265
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:37.224
his own hands.

266
00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:40.827
Everyone dies
at some point in time.

267
00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.896
But what is the enemy
is terminal suffering.

268
00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:48.935
None of us want people who are
about to die to suffer and we go

269
00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:51.738
about different ways in
trying to take care of that.

270
00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:55.342
Language we use at end of life
is so important that we...

271
00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:59.446
Dr. Grube speaks to
medical students around the

272
00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:05.185
country about medical
ethics and end of life care.

273
00:18:06.386 --> 00:18:09.956
Those weeks or days
or months sometimes when a.

274
00:18:09.989 --> 00:18:12.192
a person who is
going to die anyway

275
00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:14.561
has intolerable suffering.

276
00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:18.064
I am trying to persuade them
to open their minds to the fact

277
00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:21.134
that this is something I
think that's compassionate.

278
00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:24.504
Most people do not
choose aid in dying because of

279
00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:26.173
lack of pain control.

280
00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:30.076
Everybody thinks well.
gosh. it's they're having.

281
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.011
oh the suffering is pain.

282
00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.547
Their suffering
may be anhedonia.

283
00:18:35.682 --> 00:18:38.585
lack of joy or lack of
pleasure. loss of autonomy.

284
00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.888
loss of dignity.

285
00:18:41.921 --> 00:18:43.623
We see the
world differently.

286
00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:46.193
You know. I believe that the
solution to suffering is to help

287
00:18:46.226 --> 00:18:47.860
the sufferer. to be
with the sufferer.

288
00:18:47.894 --> 00:18:50.663
to be willing to suffer
with the patient.

289
00:18:50.697 --> 00:18:53.400
That's what I dedicated my life
to over these last 40 years

290
00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:54.601
as a doctor.

291
00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.803
We have to do a better
job of allowing people to

292
00:18:56.836 --> 00:19:00.207
die with dignity. naturally
at the end of their life.

293
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.075
This is something that's
been much discussed at our

294
00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:06.246
national meetings for
geriatrics and for hospice

295
00:19:07.046 --> 00:19:09.081
and palliative medicine.

296
00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:12.252
So. it wasn't a new
issue for any of us.

297
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:15.455
There's a lot of
genuine disagreement.

298
00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:19.192
there's respect on both sides.
but some people don't feel it's

299
00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:21.528
an appropriate thing
for a doctor to do.

300
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:27.200
I wonder about the
Hippocratic Oath. to do no harm.

301
00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:30.937
How does that work
into your thinking?

302
00:19:31.638 --> 00:19:33.506
Do no harm.

303
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.009
What is harm and who
gets to define harm?

304
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.747
The harm is
defined by the patient and

305
00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.148
not by the doctor.

306
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:45.585
And the suffering
is defined by the patient.

307
00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:47.620
Yeah.

308
00:19:48.255 --> 00:19:50.557
Bodie and I. he
loves to come with me.

309
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.924
He loves to...

310
00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:56.763
Roger was diagnosed
with incurable stage 4

311
00:19:56.796 --> 00:19:58.931
prostate cancer.

312
00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:03.536
He has since retired
from practicing medicine.

313
00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:09.342
but he and his dog Bodie
walk seven miles every day.

314
00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.679
no matter the weather.

315
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:18.451
I always would tell
my patients that just because

316
00:20:18.485 --> 00:20:22.589
you've got a terminal
condition doesn't mean that

317
00:20:22.622 --> 00:20:25.191
you're dead yet.

318
00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:26.993
That you should go on.

319
00:20:27.026 --> 00:20:28.728
you should continue
living your life.

320
00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:31.898
you should seek the beauty
that's in it and the enjoyment

321
00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:33.600
that you can.

322
00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:43.743
John Rehm could have had
such a peaceful death with his

323
00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:49.416
family around him. with
all of us saying goodbye.

324
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.420
Basically for two weeks.
I listened every day.

325
00:20:53.453 --> 00:20:56.088
sometimes twice a day. to my mom
get updates from my grandmother

326
00:20:56.122 --> 00:20:59.492
about how his condition
was like slowly declining.

327
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.797
It was just an
excruciating time for

328
00:21:04.831 --> 00:21:07.367
all of them.

329
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.971
And especially for Diane. to
have to sit and just watch this

330
00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.341
over such a long period.

331
00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:19.245
On the ninth day.
I stayed overnight.

332
00:21:20.513 --> 00:21:25.552
sleeping on two chairs. or
trying to sleep on two chairs.

333
00:21:26.653 --> 00:21:29.756
watching this man suffer.

334
00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:36.629
And the next day. my
dear John was gone.

335
00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:45.171
I spoke with
Lori Wallace-Pushinaitis

336
00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:47.540
and her doctor.

337
00:21:48.408 --> 00:21:52.745
Lori followed the passage of
the California law closely.

338
00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:55.782
I
have had cancer for a little

339
00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:57.384
over seven years.

340
00:21:57.417 --> 00:22:00.387
I have known it's metastatic
for a little over four years.

341
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.390
and if it's metastatic.
there is no cure.

342
00:22:03.423 --> 00:22:05.992
I'm going to die of
breast cancer. right.

343
00:22:06.025 --> 00:22:09.362
So the minute I found out that
there was legislation that was

344
00:22:09.396 --> 00:22:11.364
being considered that
we would vote on.

345
00:22:11.398 --> 00:22:13.966
I started telling my
oncologist immediately. okay.

346
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.870
in today's notes. I want you
to put that I want this option.

347
00:22:17.904 --> 00:22:20.172
And she's like. oh. but we
don't. it's not even passed yet.

348
00:22:20.206 --> 00:22:21.708
I'm like I don't care.

349
00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:23.743
I want there to be as long a
history in my medical records

350
00:22:23.776 --> 00:22:26.145
as possible.

351
00:22:28.381 --> 00:22:30.983
We met
specifically around the issue

352
00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:35.221
of. of her interest
in the option.

353
00:22:35.888 --> 00:22:36.956
Right.

354
00:22:36.989 --> 00:22:38.290
Not with a plan.

355
00:22:38.324 --> 00:22:41.160
but just the reassurance
that if it were there.

356
00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:43.029
that that would be
comforting to her.

357
00:22:43.062 --> 00:22:45.498
And I
can't. I can't choose when.

358
00:22:45.532 --> 00:22:50.503
because if I would choose
when. it would be when I'm 90.

359
00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:52.772
but that's not an option. right.

360
00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:56.242
Lori. if you
had the medication.

361
00:22:56.275 --> 00:22:59.412
do you think you'd use it?

362
00:22:59.446 --> 00:23:01.681
I don't know.

363
00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:03.616
I mean I can't. I don't
know how it's going to look

364
00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:04.917
when I'm dying.

365
00:23:04.951 --> 00:23:10.056
So. you know. I would love
to fall asleep and then die

366
00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:11.257
in my sleep.

367
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.493
That'd be great.
I'd love to do that.

368
00:23:13.526 --> 00:23:18.030
But. if it gets to the point
where I have no quality of life

369
00:23:18.064 --> 00:23:20.399
and I cannot have
my pain maintained.

370
00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:22.735
I'm going to want to do
something about that.

371
00:23:22.769 --> 00:23:25.738
not only for me. but
also for my children.

372
00:23:25.772 --> 00:23:27.474
I have a 12-year old.

373
00:23:27.507 --> 00:23:30.810
He does not need to see
his mother in misery.

374
00:23:31.744 --> 00:23:33.112
I understand.

375
00:23:33.145 --> 00:23:34.747
And I will
do whatever I can to make sure

376
00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:37.950
that it is my choice and not
someone making a choice for me.

377
00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:42.755
There's a strong belief
that good palliative medicine

378
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:46.859
can almost always relieve
suffering adequately.

379
00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.062
Yet there are limits.

380
00:23:50.096 --> 00:23:53.165
And I think that everybody has
to acknowledge that anything in

381
00:23:53.199 --> 00:23:55.868
medicine has a time
when it doesn't work.

382
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:58.104
In my experience.

383
00:23:58.137 --> 00:24:00.940
there's a subgroup of people
for which nothing that we have

384
00:24:00.973 --> 00:24:05.211
treats. at the end of life.
treats their suffering. nothing.

385
00:24:05.678 --> 00:24:09.448
25% of people who
die with chronic illness.

386
00:24:09.482 --> 00:24:12.351
die with uncontrolled pain.

387
00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:14.987
And in the
palliative world.

388
00:24:15.021 --> 00:24:19.592
we have a lot of experience with
physicians being very reluctant

389
00:24:19.626 --> 00:24:23.896
to adequately treat pain
because they worry about

390
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:25.565
hastening death.

391
00:24:25.598 --> 00:24:28.167
But this is a tension
that many physicians work with

392
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.669
all the time.

393
00:24:29.702 --> 00:24:32.238
that they're actually
afraid to adequately treat

394
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:35.374
cancer pain or
other kinds of pain.

395
00:24:35.407 --> 00:24:38.678
so doctors have struggled
with this a lot.

396
00:24:40.379 --> 00:24:44.050
The more I learned
about medical aid in dying.

397
00:24:44.917 --> 00:24:50.422
the more I came to appreciate
how complex an issue it is.

398
00:24:51.791 --> 00:24:57.196
But for some patients. there
can be barriers to care based on

399
00:24:57.997 --> 00:25:03.069
race or ethnicity.
poverty. and other factors.

400
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.106
So. Mrs. C. we're going
to up and see her right after.

401
00:25:07.139 --> 00:25:11.711
To understand this better.
I visited Highland Hospital

402
00:25:13.045 --> 00:25:19.752
where I met Dr. Jessica Zitter.
an expert in palliative care.

403
00:25:21.153 --> 00:25:22.855
What's something
interesting to me and very

404
00:25:22.889 --> 00:25:25.758
alarming as somebody who
takes care of patients.

405
00:25:25.792 --> 00:25:28.460
a lot of African
American patients.

406
00:25:28.494 --> 00:25:31.463
a lot of patients of
color. people. you know.

407
00:25:31.497 --> 00:25:34.333
who don't speak English. is
that there are many. many.

408
00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:38.370
many options that
are not available.

409
00:25:39.305 --> 00:25:41.941
They don't tend to see or hear
about hospice and palliative

410
00:25:41.974 --> 00:25:47.346
care as much as white patients
do. or to access or to use it.

411
00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:48.648
It's a real problem.

412
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:50.082
Isn't that interesting?
- Yeah.

413
00:25:50.116 --> 00:25:53.753
Access to medical
care is unevenly distributed in

414
00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:56.155
all aspects
throughout our state.

415
00:25:56.188 --> 00:25:57.657
Throughout
the country. indeed.

416
00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.491
Rich. throughout
the county. rich people.

417
00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:01.193
poor people. insured
people. non-insured people.

418
00:26:01.227 --> 00:26:04.330
black people. white people.
Latino people. Asian people.

419
00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:09.936
there is no even distribution of
access and there is the unequal

420
00:26:09.969 --> 00:26:13.239
access to aid in dying just
like we see unequal access to

421
00:26:13.272 --> 00:26:14.641
everything else.

422
00:26:14.674 --> 00:26:17.109
It's more like
ache than pain right now.

423
00:26:17.543 --> 00:26:18.645
Good.

424
00:26:18.678 --> 00:26:20.613
The pain
is like. you know.

425
00:26:20.647 --> 00:26:22.715
Softened a little bit.

426
00:26:22.749 --> 00:26:28.621
So when do you reach that point
when you say to the patient.

427
00:26:29.956 --> 00:26:34.160
maybe there's nothing
more we should do?

428
00:26:35.261 --> 00:26:39.231
When do you do that. and how do
you communicate that to them?

429
00:26:39.565 --> 00:26:41.267
Well.
first. first of all.

430
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.369
I would say those words are
not the words that I would use.

431
00:26:43.402 --> 00:26:44.637
which is there's nothing more.

432
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:46.939
There's always something
more we can do.

433
00:26:46.973 --> 00:26:49.008
there's always something
more we can do. right.

434
00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:50.276
But...

435
00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:51.778
Maybe we can't
cure the disease.

436
00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:54.413
Maybe our treatments can't stop
this disease from progressing.

437
00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:56.215
But there's lots of other
successes we can have.

438
00:26:56.248 --> 00:26:57.583
That's right.

439
00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.151
I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. that's sore.

440
00:26:59.185 --> 00:27:00.619
I'm sorry. Okay.
You know what I'm going to do?

441
00:27:00.653 --> 00:27:01.854
I'm going to go call the team.

442
00:27:01.888 --> 00:27:03.022
We're going to go find
out what's going on.

443
00:27:03.055 --> 00:27:04.691
Okay.

444
00:27:04.724 --> 00:27:06.726
There are definitely
families I've encountered that

445
00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:09.128
feel like saying that we're
not going to intubate your

446
00:27:09.161 --> 00:27:11.163
loved one. saying that I
don't think it's a good idea.

447
00:27:11.197 --> 00:27:12.965
they perceive as...

448
00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:14.200
An abandonment?

449
00:27:14.233 --> 00:27:16.602
As sort of harmful or
an abandonment. right.

450
00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:19.171
Hello.

451
00:27:19.205 --> 00:27:21.007
How are you today?

452
00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.308
How are you feeling?

453
00:27:22.341 --> 00:27:23.910
One of the
things in. you know.

454
00:27:23.943 --> 00:27:27.013
that's a factor in my practice
is I'm so afraid to think that

455
00:27:27.046 --> 00:27:30.049
someone would think that I was
depriving them of something.

456
00:27:30.082 --> 00:27:33.252
on a racial basis or because
they were less educated.

457
00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:35.922
That's a terrifying
thought for me.

458
00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:39.025
So you can imagine the impulse
to that would be to say well.

459
00:27:39.058 --> 00:27:41.260
let's just do everything. let's
just keep going. we'll trach.

460
00:27:41.293 --> 00:27:42.729
we'll peg. we'll do everything.

461
00:27:42.762 --> 00:27:45.497
And I think that what I've
learned from the palliative care

462
00:27:45.531 --> 00:27:51.170
movement is to stop and to. to.
to try and tolerate the feeling

463
00:27:51.203 --> 00:27:53.873
of discomfort in myself. the
feeling of discomfort in the

464
00:27:53.906 --> 00:27:58.044
loved one or the patient and
stay in the conversation.

465
00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:02.048
Oh. gracious Lord. we pause
for just a moment from a place

466
00:28:02.081 --> 00:28:04.951
of thanksgiving and gratitude.
just knowing that you are right

467
00:28:04.984 --> 00:28:08.520
here in the presence
with each of...

468
00:28:09.722 --> 00:28:12.591
I love Washington. DC.

469
00:28:13.492 --> 00:28:15.995
It's been my home
all of my life.

470
00:28:17.163 --> 00:28:20.666
and I've never wanted
to live anywhere else.

471
00:28:22.935 --> 00:28:28.540
Over the decades. I've seen
tremendous changes happen here.

472
00:28:32.111 --> 00:28:37.716
Finally. after a long battle.
the District of Columbia has

473
00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:43.522
approved the right to
medical aid in dying.

474
00:28:44.991 --> 00:28:49.896
Tell me a little about
how difficult it was to get

475
00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:52.298
this law passed.

476
00:28:52.331 --> 00:28:54.867
Well. it was not easy.

477
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:58.370
People need time to adapt to
changing social circumstances.

478
00:28:58.404 --> 00:29:01.140
especially big issues like this.

479
00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:10.749
Diane. the reason I
opposed the law was the deep

480
00:29:10.783 --> 00:29:15.254
history of malfeasance when it
comes to the United States of

481
00:29:15.287 --> 00:29:19.792
America and the medical
establishment's commitment to

482
00:29:19.826 --> 00:29:23.362
caring equally for bodies
that are not white.

483
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:31.237
I understand the law. I support
what the law makes available.

484
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:38.577
but I do not trust the
government and establishment

485
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.013
to be fair.

486
00:29:46.152 --> 00:29:48.387
Put your hands
together. everybody. welcome!

487
00:29:52.358 --> 00:29:55.261
Would you reach your neighbors
this morning in a spirit

488
00:29:55.294 --> 00:29:56.428
of love. peace and joy?

489
00:29:56.996 --> 00:29:59.465
There was a good deal
of concern. skepticism.

490
00:29:59.498 --> 00:30:03.002
perhaps even suspicion on the
part of African Americans about

491
00:30:03.035 --> 00:30:05.771
some of these medical things
because in the past. we've had.

492
00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:08.374
we have a terrible history
of taking advantage

493
00:30:08.407 --> 00:30:10.642
of African Americans.

494
00:30:10.676 --> 00:30:11.743
Of course.

495
00:30:11.777 --> 00:30:13.312
I got more
opposition from.

496
00:30:13.345 --> 00:30:15.714
from religion than I did from
African American communities.

497
00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:18.584
The Catholics were the ones
that are the most opposed.

498
00:30:18.617 --> 00:30:20.552
in my opinion and were
during this debate.

499
00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.390
And I was raised Catholic. so
I kind of knew their arguments

500
00:30:24.423 --> 00:30:25.791
before they came in.

501
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:27.393
But it was important to listen.

502
00:30:27.426 --> 00:30:28.961
This is a choice.

503
00:30:28.995 --> 00:30:30.262
No one has to participate.

504
00:30:30.296 --> 00:30:33.199
No doctor. no pharmacy.
no provider. no person.

505
00:30:33.232 --> 00:30:34.800
No one.

506
00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:38.104
If somebody is a person of faith
and they feel that their faith

507
00:30:38.137 --> 00:30:41.273
prevents them from doing this.
they're completely entitled to

508
00:30:41.307 --> 00:30:43.375
not act on it.

509
00:30:43.409 --> 00:30:48.280
Or if there's a hospital that's
religiously affiliated and they

510
00:30:48.314 --> 00:30:52.184
feel that their hospital should
participate in this whatsoever.

511
00:30:52.218 --> 00:30:54.720
that's their choice.

512
00:30:55.187 --> 00:30:58.891
While many religions
disagree with these laws.

513
00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:04.563
the Catholic Church is
the most outspoken and

514
00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:07.599
best funded opponent.

515
00:31:08.534 --> 00:31:14.440
Please tell us what the Roman
Catholic's Church's position is

516
00:31:14.473 --> 00:31:17.343
on medical aid in dying.

517
00:31:18.144 --> 00:31:20.346
We have a
creator who creates life.

518
00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:24.183
but part of that created order
is there is a natural way that

519
00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:26.352
we die. and return
to our creator.

520
00:31:27.053 --> 00:31:28.955
We shouldn't take
control over that.

521
00:31:28.988 --> 00:31:31.323
but to let it unfold as
nature would have it.

522
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:37.997
I know you are a
devout Roman Catholic.

523
00:31:39.598 --> 00:31:41.033
Striving to be.

524
00:31:41.067 --> 00:31:45.972
How much does your
religious belief

525
00:31:46.005 --> 00:31:48.407
motivate your thinking?

526
00:31:48.774 --> 00:31:50.276
It's in sync
with my thinking.

527
00:31:50.309 --> 00:31:52.411
I say all human life
is inherently valuable.

528
00:31:52.444 --> 00:31:54.313
There's a million doctors
in the country. Diane.

529
00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:57.783
And they all don't have the same
sense of reverence for life in

530
00:31:57.816 --> 00:31:59.551
all the stages. the beauty.

531
00:31:59.585 --> 00:32:01.120
So in the
Catholic tradition.

532
00:32:01.153 --> 00:32:03.822
we would say that as your
quality of life diminishes.

533
00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:08.727
your obligation to pursue
and maintain life diminishes

534
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.096
as well.

535
00:32:10.129 --> 00:32:11.863
When we're just
maintaining life.

536
00:32:11.897 --> 00:32:14.366
that is not living
the fullness of life.

537
00:32:15.334 --> 00:32:18.704
so we're allowed to say no to
medical interventions that would

538
00:32:18.737 --> 00:32:20.806
prolong that life.

539
00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:25.044
But what about
medical aid in dying?

540
00:32:25.544 --> 00:32:27.146
Right.

541
00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:29.315
Since death is a part of life.
we would say it's one thing to

542
00:32:29.348 --> 00:32:31.750
say. you know. my quality
of life is diminishing.

543
00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:33.552
I don't want to
pursue this. that.

544
00:32:33.585 --> 00:32:36.788
It's another thing to step in
and to take over the process.

545
00:32:40.926 --> 00:32:46.398
If I had a magic wand
that would ensure that no person

546
00:32:47.433 --> 00:32:50.636
at all. no matter who they are.
would be discriminated against.

547
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:54.873
and that they would be treated
fairly and honorably and if this

548
00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:57.943
was that person's decision.
then I would support it.

549
00:32:59.645 --> 00:33:02.014
Maryland is
just one of the

550
00:33:02.048 --> 00:33:06.818
many states that have
considered medical aid in dying

551
00:33:07.886 --> 00:33:11.090
over the past several years.

552
00:33:12.358 --> 00:33:16.062
The opponents of the
bill that contacted me over the

553
00:33:16.095 --> 00:33:18.030
course of the last
couple of years have.

554
00:33:18.064 --> 00:33:21.567
have largely focused
on religious arguments.

555
00:33:21.967 --> 00:33:23.469
moral arguments.

556
00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:28.540
It's always been an issue
that I've struggled with. and.

557
00:33:28.574 --> 00:33:30.809
you know. it's been in the
legislature for a number of

558
00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:33.512
years now. and I was
originally opposed.

559
00:33:33.545 --> 00:33:36.248
And I was worried that it
would normalize suicide.

560
00:33:36.282 --> 00:33:40.352
I was worried that it was.
it was a first step on a.

561
00:33:40.386 --> 00:33:42.288
a slippery slope.

562
00:33:42.321 --> 00:33:45.957
Do you consider
medical aid in dying suicide?

563
00:33:47.593 --> 00:33:48.827
No.

564
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.397
The person is on the
threshold of dying.

565
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:55.667
We're just choosing how. in that
little window that they have

566
00:33:55.701 --> 00:33:58.270
left. how they choose to die.

567
00:33:59.205 --> 00:34:02.208
People who are going
to suicide have the choice to

568
00:34:02.241 --> 00:34:04.543
live and choose
to end their life.

569
00:34:06.245 --> 00:34:09.481
People who are doing
aid in dying don't have the

570
00:34:09.515 --> 00:34:10.949
choice to live.

571
00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:14.120
Tell me. if you can.

572
00:34:14.153 --> 00:34:17.523
what happened to
change your thinking.

573
00:34:19.024 --> 00:34:22.461
It changed with
the death of my mother.

574
00:34:23.229 --> 00:34:28.467
She contracted esophageal
cancer in 2014.

575
00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.504
You know. the doctors
did their best to try to

576
00:34:32.538 --> 00:34:33.872
make her comfortable.

577
00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:37.909
She was obviously in
pretty extreme pain.

578
00:34:37.943 --> 00:34:41.046
even with all the palliative
care she was getting.

579
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:45.117
A few days before she died.
she went into the kitchen and

580
00:34:45.151 --> 00:34:47.286
got the bottle of liquid
morphine that she'd been

581
00:34:47.319 --> 00:34:49.688
prescribed for
the pain and tried to drink it.

582
00:34:49.721 --> 00:34:52.224
tried to commit suicide.

583
00:34:59.398 --> 00:35:02.801
Thinking about my mother and
what she went through and I

584
00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:09.941
began to question whether I had
the right as an elected official

585
00:35:11.243 --> 00:35:17.616
or even as her next of kin to
make that decision for her.

586
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:26.625
Delegate Luedtke's story
reminded me of something another

587
00:35:26.658 --> 00:35:33.499
legislator told me. that each
of us is just one bad death away

588
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.904
from supporting these laws.

589
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:48.647
Bill Roberts and I have been
friends since high school when

590
00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:54.353
we were voted "cutest couple"
in the graduating class.

591
00:35:54.953 --> 00:36:02.694
But in 2018. he was diagnosed
with stage 4 prostate cancer and

592
00:36:03.762 --> 00:36:06.498
congestive heart failure.

593
00:36:07.466 --> 00:36:11.637
As happened with
John Rehm and myself.

594
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:16.275
Irene and Bill had to
face their own mortality.

595
00:36:18.544 --> 00:36:21.647
And we have
discussed end of life because

596
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.249
friends have died.

597
00:36:23.282 --> 00:36:26.818
You know. and sometimes terrible
things have happened to people

598
00:36:26.852 --> 00:36:32.391
we've loved so much and it was.
it was happening to us.

599
00:36:32.424 --> 00:36:34.926
You know. when you
get to be in your 80s.

600
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.297
you know no one gets out alive.

601
00:36:39.465 --> 00:36:42.601
I guess there's a bet
going with the doctors at the

602
00:36:42.634 --> 00:36:46.672
hospital as to what'll
get me first. the.

603
00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:48.774
the heart failure or the cancer.

604
00:36:49.808 --> 00:36:55.614
You live in Colorado
where medical aid in dying

605
00:36:55.647 --> 00:36:57.683
is permitted.

606
00:36:57.716 --> 00:37:01.052
I feel very lucky
in. in living in Colorado and

607
00:37:01.086 --> 00:37:02.688
having this option.

608
00:37:02.721 --> 00:37:08.727
It will be a gentle easing
into whatever comes next.

609
00:37:09.861 --> 00:37:15.133
I. I. I have no great
anticipation for the next life.

610
00:37:16.302 --> 00:37:20.672
but I'll tell you what. I'll.
I'll find out and I'll try to

611
00:37:20.706 --> 00:37:22.073
let you know.

612
00:37:22.107 --> 00:37:26.077
That conversation
was bittersweet for me.

613
00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:32.217
I knew that my old
friend would die soon.

614
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:37.389
but I took comfort in knowing
that he. unlike my husband.

615
00:37:38.757 --> 00:37:43.762
would have the option
of medical aid in dying.

616
00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:52.270
I want to say thank you
to everyone who is here.

617
00:37:52.304 --> 00:37:54.473
I want to say to the proponents.

618
00:37:54.506 --> 00:37:56.475
the people who are
here in favor of the bill.

619
00:37:56.508 --> 00:37:58.777
thank you so much
for all your efforts and I'm so

620
00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.312
grateful to have you here.

621
00:38:00.346 --> 00:38:02.481
And I want to say
to the opponents.

622
00:38:02.514 --> 00:38:05.150
thank you for taking
your time to be here...

623
00:38:05.617 --> 00:38:08.987
And so. when the
Maryland legislature took up

624
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.756
the matter again.

625
00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:12.324
We're going to
call House Bill 3.

626
00:38:12.358 --> 00:38:15.461
And I was
asked to testify.

627
00:38:15.494 --> 00:38:20.699
both Bill Roberts and
John Rehm were very much

628
00:38:20.732 --> 00:38:22.501
on my mind.

629
00:38:22.534 --> 00:38:24.603
The Maryland
legislation that is before

630
00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:27.639
you today has been
modeled after the Oregon

631
00:38:27.673 --> 00:38:30.241
Death with Dignity Act.

632
00:38:30.275 --> 00:38:33.445
And it's been implemented in
eight other jurisdictions for a

633
00:38:33.479 --> 00:38:35.614
combined 40 years of experience.

634
00:38:36.615 --> 00:38:39.518
And I hope that this time
around that we can bring this

635
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:41.887
compassionate and
much needed option to the

636
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.790
residents of Maryland.

637
00:38:45.491 --> 00:38:48.527
Good afternoon.
I'm Diane Rehm.

638
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:55.467
The legislation you are
considering might have permitted

639
00:38:55.501 --> 00:39:02.641
John Rehm to have the measure
of autonomy that he wanted over

640
00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:05.176
his own death.

641
00:39:06.512 --> 00:39:12.418
By this time. what I had heard
from patients. family members.

642
00:39:12.451 --> 00:39:16.121
physicians and others
had taught me a lot.

643
00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:23.061
This end of life option provokes
strong feelings in people.

644
00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:25.597
as it should.

645
00:39:25.631 --> 00:39:30.335
and as the concerns of the
Maryland lawmakers demonstrated.

646
00:39:31.937 --> 00:39:33.238
Delegate Watson.

647
00:39:33.271 --> 00:39:34.940
Thank you. Mr. Chair.

648
00:39:34.973 --> 00:39:36.241
and thank you all
for coming out.

649
00:39:36.274 --> 00:39:37.409
I really appreciate it.

650
00:39:37.443 --> 00:39:38.644
This has answered
a lot of questions.

651
00:39:38.677 --> 00:39:40.446
but I still have one
or two remaining.

652
00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:43.114
We had had a very
emotionally wrought debate on

653
00:39:43.148 --> 00:39:44.750
the bill when it came
to the House floor.

654
00:39:44.783 --> 00:39:47.553
It was a very difficult
conversation to have.

655
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.889
My concern is based
around the financial capability

656
00:39:50.922 --> 00:39:54.760
and dwindling resources as we
age. of certain demographics.

657
00:39:55.794 --> 00:39:57.863
The concern
from my constituents is like

658
00:39:57.896 --> 00:40:00.499
a lot of them.
they have a concern about fear.

659
00:40:00.532 --> 00:40:03.101
economic situation.
vulnerable community.

660
00:40:03.869 --> 00:40:05.771
I mean what if.
at the end of the day.

661
00:40:05.804 --> 00:40:08.540
a health insurance company looks
at it strictly as any business

662
00:40:08.574 --> 00:40:12.778
to maximize revenue. and they
say instead of paying for

663
00:40:12.811 --> 00:40:16.181
someone to take chemo over an
extended period of time when

664
00:40:16.214 --> 00:40:17.883
they're going to
pass away anyway.

665
00:40:17.916 --> 00:40:20.819
let's save money and give
them this one option.

666
00:40:21.787 --> 00:40:24.055
The. the folks that
maybe don't have the best

667
00:40:24.089 --> 00:40:26.858
insurance to get
the best treatment.

668
00:40:26.892 --> 00:40:28.894
are going to be kind
of if they're in pain.

669
00:40:28.927 --> 00:40:30.328
this may be their only option?

670
00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:31.963
And what the
fact is in the health care

671
00:40:31.997 --> 00:40:33.632
insurance industry.

672
00:40:33.665 --> 00:40:36.835
a dead person is the most
cost effective person of all.

673
00:40:37.569 --> 00:40:41.473
What's the difference
between this medical aid in

674
00:40:41.507 --> 00:40:43.675
dying medication
and the morphine?

675
00:40:43.709 --> 00:40:46.645
What happens if the
medication isn't administered

676
00:40:46.678 --> 00:40:49.548
properly or if it
doesn't work as intended?

677
00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:52.551
Can you
explain. very briefly.

678
00:40:52.584 --> 00:40:56.087
what a physician looks to to
determine mental capacity?

679
00:40:56.121 --> 00:41:01.660
How do you respond
to folks who feel very strongly

680
00:41:01.693 --> 00:41:07.933
that aid in dying would increase
the risk of death for truly

681
00:41:07.966 --> 00:41:09.801
vulnerable people?

682
00:41:09.835 --> 00:41:12.938
That is those who are
disabled in some way.

683
00:41:13.905 --> 00:41:17.342
Amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis. for example. ALS...

684
00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:19.144
These laws
that we've passed.

685
00:41:19.177 --> 00:41:20.746
the law here and in
other jurisdictions.

686
00:41:20.779 --> 00:41:23.815
requires that somebody
meet certain criteria.

687
00:41:23.849 --> 00:41:27.085
That means that people who are
not able to self-administer

688
00:41:27.118 --> 00:41:29.387
cannot avail
themselves of this law.

689
00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:32.190
And there was an
interesting divide in the

690
00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:33.692
disabled community.

691
00:41:33.725 --> 00:41:36.061
There were those who were
worried that this would be a

692
00:41:36.094 --> 00:41:38.830
step toward euthanasia and
people who were disabled would.

693
00:41:38.864 --> 00:41:42.433
you know. be at risk.
you know. in the future.

694
00:41:42.467 --> 00:41:44.870
But there are others in the
disabled community who were

695
00:41:44.903 --> 00:41:48.740
disappointed in the legislation
because they said what if we

696
00:41:48.774 --> 00:41:52.043
have a disability that prevents
us from self-administering.

697
00:41:52.077 --> 00:41:56.314
And I said. you know. it's not a
flaw in the legislation so much

698
00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:59.217
it is an understanding of
what we could accomplish

699
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.552
at this time.

700
00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:03.855
So you have to keep in
mind you've got this legislation

701
00:42:03.889 --> 00:42:06.324
and its protections. but you
also have an entire practice of

702
00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:09.127
medicine where doctors
are licensed and education

703
00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.829
and certification.

704
00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:13.398
Those practices and rules
also govern this practice.

705
00:42:14.332 --> 00:42:17.736
I think that we make
a lot of rash and bad decisions

706
00:42:17.769 --> 00:42:19.537
sometimes when we're
in pain. because all...

707
00:42:19.571 --> 00:42:24.743
The legislators expressed
very understandable concerns.

708
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:29.047
But in states where laws
have been implemented.

709
00:42:29.748 --> 00:42:34.419
evidence shows the protections
written into them have worked.

710
00:42:35.687 --> 00:42:40.959
Knowing that lets me focus on
what is so important to me.

711
00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.095
individual autonomy.

712
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:52.938
My philosophy in this matter
is to respect that singularly

713
00:42:53.639 --> 00:42:56.808
personal moment for each of us.

714
00:42:58.443 --> 00:43:04.683
If you believe that only
God should be the decider.

715
00:43:06.284 --> 00:43:10.956
I support you 100%.

716
00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:19.330
If you wish to have
every single option that

717
00:43:19.364 --> 00:43:21.967
medical science can provide.

718
00:43:22.934 --> 00:43:27.072
I support you 100%.

719
00:43:29.174 --> 00:43:33.712
And if you believe. as I do.

720
00:43:35.413 --> 00:43:41.987
that you want the
right to end your suffering

721
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:49.527
at a time you choose.
I support you 100%.

722
00:43:50.228 --> 00:43:52.263
The bill went over to
the Senate and I think I lot of

723
00:43:52.297 --> 00:43:54.733
the senators were struggling
with the issue in the same way

724
00:43:54.766 --> 00:43:56.367
that a lot of them
members of the House were.

725
00:43:56.401 --> 00:44:00.538
It did end up tying. one vote
short of what it needed to pass.

726
00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:02.307
I was disappointed
when the bill failed.

727
00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.543
So was I.

728
00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:09.881
But I expect the
bill will come up again.

729
00:44:09.915 --> 00:44:13.752
and I hope it will
pass next time.

730
00:44:16.087 --> 00:44:21.927
Washington. D.C.'s Death with
Dignity Law went into effect in

731
00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:31.136
June of 2017. but no terminally
ill patient actually used the

732
00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:33.839
law for over a year.

733
00:44:36.641 --> 00:44:42.480
One of the first patients to
do so was journalist and artist

734
00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:45.817
Mary Klein.

735
00:44:48.386 --> 00:44:55.093
Stella Dawson was Mary's wife
and life partner for more than

736
00:44:55.126 --> 00:44:57.528
37 years.

737
00:44:58.864 --> 00:45:02.300
Mary was complaining of
stomach pains and of digestive

738
00:45:02.333 --> 00:45:06.838
problems. she said Stella.
I'm really. really tired.

739
00:45:06.872 --> 00:45:12.310
I came back from work and
Mary took my hand and took me

740
00:45:12.343 --> 00:45:16.081
into the living room
and we sat down.

741
00:45:16.114 --> 00:45:21.386
and she said. "Stella.
I think I have cancer."

742
00:45:21.887 --> 00:45:25.791
And so we spent the weekend
researching doctors and got an

743
00:45:25.824 --> 00:45:30.962
appointment and sure enough.
it was advanced ovarian cancer.

744
00:45:33.999 --> 00:45:39.104
She did five series of
chemo because she was.

745
00:45:39.137 --> 00:45:44.175
she wanted to live and
she wanted that opportunity

746
00:45:44.209 --> 00:45:47.678
to enjoy her life.

747
00:45:47.712 --> 00:45:51.917
So she did all that she could
for as long as she could.

748
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.122
Nothing was working.

749
00:45:58.723 --> 00:46:04.095
Mary's diagnosis came
before medical aid in dying was

750
00:46:04.129 --> 00:46:07.933
legal in Washington. D.C.

751
00:46:08.399 --> 00:46:11.970
But as her disease progressed.

752
00:46:12.003 --> 00:46:16.307
she learned the City Council
would be voting on a bill.

753
00:46:18.476 --> 00:46:20.211
Mary said to me.

754
00:46:20.245 --> 00:46:23.214
"Stella. there's a
chance that we can get

755
00:46:23.248 --> 00:46:25.884
medical aid in dying
here in the District."

756
00:46:25.917 --> 00:46:31.990
so we both hit the telephones.
started writing letters.

757
00:46:34.292 --> 00:46:38.296
And Mary Cheh was the
first person who responded.

758
00:46:39.697 --> 00:46:42.233
She was very. very brave.

759
00:46:42.267 --> 00:46:43.701
She was quite ill too.

760
00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:44.970
I know.

761
00:46:45.003 --> 00:46:46.938
And she would come
and she would testify.

762
00:46:46.972 --> 00:46:49.340
She was not even sure
that the law would be in place

763
00:46:49.374 --> 00:46:51.877
before she passed away.

764
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:55.013
And so I remember her saying.
"This is what I'm trying to do

765
00:46:55.046 --> 00:46:57.916
with my end of life is give
somebody in the future the

766
00:46:57.949 --> 00:47:01.519
freedom to make this decision
and not have to go through what

767
00:47:01.552 --> 00:47:02.720
I've gone through."

768
00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:04.856
And let me just say.

769
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:07.025
these are difficult
conversations to have

770
00:47:07.058 --> 00:47:08.693
with your doctor.

771
00:47:08.726 --> 00:47:11.262
Mary spoke out at a

772
00:47:11.296 --> 00:47:13.798
public meeting saying.

773
00:47:14.699 --> 00:47:16.902
"I can't find a doctor

774
00:47:16.935 --> 00:47:21.139
who is willing to
participate with me."

775
00:47:22.207 --> 00:47:26.644
So how difficult was
it to find that doctor?

776
00:47:27.979 --> 00:47:29.881
It was very stressful.

777
00:47:29.915 --> 00:47:32.250
Mary Klein was
referred to you?

778
00:47:33.184 --> 00:47:34.485
She told me

779
00:47:34.519 --> 00:47:36.287
as soon as we met

780
00:47:36.321 --> 00:47:38.223
that she was looking for
a physician to help her.

781
00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:41.626
And she said.
"I've never done this.

782
00:47:41.659 --> 00:47:44.029
If you're willing to on
this journey with me.

783
00:47:44.062 --> 00:47:46.097
I'm willing to go
on it with you."

784
00:47:46.131 --> 00:47:47.698
Wow.

785
00:47:49.034 --> 00:47:53.204
Mary saw this
as part of a continuum of care

786
00:47:54.172 --> 00:47:58.343
and she was enrolled in hospice
and was very pleased with the

787
00:47:58.376 --> 00:47:59.544
hospice care she got.

788
00:47:59.577 --> 00:48:00.946
Good.

789
00:48:00.979 --> 00:48:03.648
But she was
waiting as long as she could

790
00:48:03.681 --> 00:48:05.951
with the medications
that we had that she could

791
00:48:05.984 --> 00:48:08.386
manage and they
weren't working anymore.

792
00:48:09.921 --> 00:48:11.489
They weren't working.

793
00:48:11.522 --> 00:48:14.459
At the very end. I said
you know I could give you enough

794
00:48:14.492 --> 00:48:19.564
medicine so that you just would
sleep for the rest of the time

795
00:48:19.597 --> 00:48:22.333
you have. and she said
I don't want that.

796
00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:30.008
She did not want to
be in a coma or a semi coma

797
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:31.909
at the end of her life.

798
00:48:31.943 --> 00:48:34.946
She wanted to be present.

799
00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:38.749
she wanted to be with
me and the dogs.

800
00:48:40.818 --> 00:48:42.620
She wanted to be
able to say goodbye.

801
00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:44.956
Of course.

802
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:47.692
And it was that
night she said to me.

803
00:48:47.725 --> 00:48:50.895
Stella it's time.

804
00:48:52.263 --> 00:48:56.701
You don't know it's going
to be the end. do you?

805
00:48:56.734 --> 00:48:57.868
No.

806
00:48:57.902 --> 00:48:59.037
You don't.

807
00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:01.006
You don't. you don't.

808
00:49:01.039 --> 00:49:03.274
You know. even though.
even though she said something

809
00:49:03.308 --> 00:49:07.945
like that. I still thought
she had several weeks.

810
00:49:07.979 --> 00:49:12.683
I visited her four days
before she died and then again

811
00:49:12.717 --> 00:49:14.252
on the day that she died.

812
00:49:14.285 --> 00:49:15.753
Oh. I'm so glad.

813
00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:18.856
And Mary was dying.
that last time I saw her.

814
00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:22.027
I. she died from ovarian cancer.

815
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:26.397
She did not die from the
potion that she drank.

816
00:49:26.964 --> 00:49:29.834
that just affected
the time she died.

817
00:49:29.867 --> 00:49:32.470
But she was already dying.

818
00:49:32.503 --> 00:49:38.576
She just laid back and
went into a very deep sleep.

819
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:43.014
And you were
right there with her.

820
00:49:43.048 --> 00:49:45.650
It was about
two and a half hours before

821
00:49:45.683 --> 00:49:48.386
she passed away.

822
00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:51.356
And she died in my arms.

823
00:49:53.124 --> 00:49:54.759
That's what she wanted.

824
00:49:54.792 --> 00:49:59.397
That's exactly. it's what she
fought so very. very hard for.

825
00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:03.468
It's a peaceful death.

826
00:50:03.501 --> 00:50:08.073
And it's a loving death.

827
00:50:14.779 --> 00:50:17.548
I think that's all I can say.

828
00:50:26.491 --> 00:50:31.596
In 2020. humanity
began a long struggle with the

829
00:50:31.629 --> 00:50:34.232
COVID-19 pandemic.

830
00:50:34.265 --> 00:50:38.669
tens of millions
became infected and many.

831
00:50:38.703 --> 00:50:41.572
many deaths were
reported each day.

832
00:50:42.707 --> 00:50:48.179
In this country. I think this
has led more of us to recognize

833
00:50:48.213 --> 00:50:54.352
the importance of making our end
of life wishes known to those

834
00:50:54.385 --> 00:50:56.154
close to us.

835
00:50:58.356 --> 00:51:01.025
Then would you be good
enough to take the phone

836
00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:04.595
out of your
pocket and video this?

837
00:51:04.629 --> 00:51:06.197
Okay.

838
00:51:06.231 --> 00:51:11.169
Because I would very much
like your mother. your father.

839
00:51:11.202 --> 00:51:18.943
uncle Dave. Aunt Nancy.
everybody to know exactly how I

840
00:51:18.976 --> 00:51:22.747
feel about what I'd
like at the end of life.

841
00:51:23.314 --> 00:51:24.515
Do you want
me to record it?

842
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:25.883
Please.

843
00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:30.054
To my family. my physician
and any hospital...

844
00:51:31.356 --> 00:51:36.194
I believe that the more we learn
to talk openly about death.

845
00:51:37.395 --> 00:51:39.063
the better.

846
00:51:39.096 --> 00:51:45.336
It's been such a taboo subject
for many of us for too long.

847
00:51:46.337 --> 00:51:51.376
but if we can discuss what
we want with our friends.

848
00:51:51.409 --> 00:51:58.483
our doctors. our families. if we
can make our own wishes known to

849
00:51:58.516 --> 00:52:03.988
those who care about us.
everyone will be more prepared.

850
00:52:05.523 --> 00:52:11.929
and the end of life will be
less stressful and could be more

851
00:52:11.962 --> 00:52:14.432
joyous for us all.

852
00:52:16.367 --> 00:52:22.440
As for me. in my early 80s.
I'm living life to the fullest.

853
00:52:24.242 --> 00:52:29.914
I'm still working.
I've remarried. I travel.

854
00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:33.751
I have a new puppy.

855
00:52:33.784 --> 00:52:36.854
Life is wonderful.

856
00:52:37.788 --> 00:52:44.762
But. I have also prepared
for what will eventually come

857
00:52:44.795 --> 00:52:49.967
for all of us.
and I'll be ready

858
00:52:51.202 --> 00:52:54.171
when my time comes.
