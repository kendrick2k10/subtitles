00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:08.875
Senses heightened
to any sound she makes.

5
00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:13.500
The little light she uses.
bounces from the walls.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.250
Deceiving her with shadows
of false sanctuary.

7
00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.875
She's terrified.

8
00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:23.167
but focussed.
Ready to move. until...

9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.250
she hears him.

10
00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:29.042
His deep
and hauntingly calm breath.

11
00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:31.542
slightly elevated by the hunt.

12
00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:35.417
matches the rhythmic
shuffle of his stride.

13
00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:39.083
She stops and listens.

14
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.708
hoping her nightmare will end.

15
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:49.333
Her heart breaks until her
salvation comes into view in
the shape of an exit door.

16
00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:54.875
She looks behind her.
gaining that last ounce
of courage to survive.

17
00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:56.750
And she runs...

18
00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:01.375
towards the exit doors
with the anticipation pounding
through her shaking body.

19
00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:03.875
But. by some cruel
twist of fate.

20
00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:05.750
what she finds...

21
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.167
is him.

22
00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:11.542
The horror in her eyes upon
his cold and jarring grasp.

23
00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:15.583
In that moment of cruel fate.

24
00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:19.792
her life flashed before her eyes
in a millisecond.

25
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.042
That horror in his eyes
is what he. the monster.

26
00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:28.125
craved for.

27
00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:30.292
It's what made his appetite grow

28
00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:32.958
with each victim the universe
offered up as sacrifice.

29
00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:39.250
It's what made an otherwise
ungodly man... a god.

30
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.583
God of death.
God of terror.

31
00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:47.542
But tonight's sacrificial feast

32
00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:51.458
was just a taste...
of the meal to come."

33
00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:54.125
(applause)

34
00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:01.208
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

35
00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:02.875
- - No problem.

36
00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:05.417
- Hi. I mean. hello.
Mr. Blake.

37
00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.958
- Oh. true fans
call me Miles.

38
00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958
(sighing)
- Miles.

39
00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.292
Your books.
they're... so addicting.

40
00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:14.292
In a good way.
A great way.

41
00:02:17.708 --> 00:02:21.875
Uh. the murders in your books.
they're so macabre. Detailed.

42
00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.375
It's like you can see inside
of all of my own fears.

43
00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:26.333
How do you do that so well?

44
00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.667
- Do we have time for a fan?
- I think so.

45
00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:33.958
- Anytime I'm writing
a new book. I just think about.

46
00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.333
you know. what my own fears are.

47
00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.000
You know. my bestseller
before this one.

48
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.333
What Lies in the Woods. that's
just based on my own fears.

49
00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:45.208
And actually writing
that story. I'm... not afraid
of the woods anymore.

50
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.042
For that. I'm grateful.

51
00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:50.625
And for you. too. of course.

52
00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:53.042
the reader. for actually
buying the book.

53
00:02:53.042 --> 00:02:55.042
- Oh. thank you so much.

54
00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:57.042
- Thank you so much.

55
00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:58.292
Next.

56
00:02:58.292 --> 00:02:59.708
- Hi.
- Hi. there.

57
00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:02.042
- All right. thanks. guys.

58
00:03:02.042 --> 00:03:03.167
Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

59
00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:05.208
- Good to see you. Thanks.

60
00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:06.708
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

61
00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:10.875
All right. I checked you in
through the airline app.

62
00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:12.583
I confirmed all your bags
and boxes are already

63
00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:14.375
at the house the university
is providing.

64
00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:17.500
- Okay. It'd be nice to get
settled in before classes start.

65
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.708
- You'll have a few days
to settle in.

66
00:03:19.708 --> 00:03:21.250
- Great.

67
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.500
- Are you sure you wanna
do this?

68
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.375
Teaching a semester of class
could be a lot of work.

69
00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:29.708
We can always back out.
Blame the book tour.

70
00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:31.833
- No. no. it's good
for the soul to be back.

71
00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:33.708
Besides. teaching about
writing's the easy part.

72
00:03:33.708 --> 00:03:35.583
What I'm looking forward to
is the time off.

73
00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:40.792
- Are you promising a draft
when the semester's over?

74
00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:42.375
- Yes. boss.

75
00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:45.833
See you on the other side
of my next bestseller.

76
00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:58.208
(soft music)

77
00:04:16.708 --> 00:04:18.333
(phone chiming)

78
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.958
- Saved by the bell. Ashley.

79
00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:39.667
- Ha. ha. the daughter
I never had.

80
00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:41.333
- One of these days.
I'm gonna tell your daughter

81
00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:42.917
that you keep saying that.
(chuckling)

82
00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:44.542
- It's good to see you.

83
00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:46.875
- Yeah. it's been
a busy semester.

84
00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:49.333
Sometimes I kick myself
for choosing to write

85
00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:51.833
my first novel
as my Master's thesis.

86
00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.542
- You know. I remember my early
days as a writer.

87
00:04:54.542 --> 00:04:56.750
I really loved deadlines.

88
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.917
And the whooshing sound they
made as they sped right by.

89
00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:01.542
(laughing)

90
00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:03.792
- But yeah. deadlines
aren't really real

91
00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:07.292
until they're staring at you...
right in the face.

92
00:05:07.292 --> 00:05:11.208
- Ah yes. your chapters.
- Hmm.

93
00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:12.792
- They are exemplary.

94
00:05:14.542 --> 00:05:17.417
- You're just saying that.
- Well. don't thank me yet.

95
00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:21.000
I'm about to make your life
and your deadlines

96
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.667
a little more busy.

97
00:05:23.875 --> 00:05:27.458
So. we're going to have a
celebrity of sorts on campus.

98
00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:29.208
- Trust me. I know.

99
00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:32.458
I'm already enrolled
in his Dynamics of Murder
Mysteries class.

100
00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:35.542
- Yeah. but that's
an underclassman credit.

101
00:05:35.542 --> 00:05:38.042
And you're a thesis away--
- A novel.

102
00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:41.542
- Yes. a novel away
from graduating with
a Master's degree.

103
00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:43.625
- He's my favorite author.

104
00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:45.625
So. wait. why is this bad news?

105
00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.333
I can still take
the class. right?

106
00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:48.958
- Oh. you'll be in his class.

107
00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958
although from a different
vantage point.

108
00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:56.958
Mr. Blake needs a teaching
assistant. and I've chosen you.

109
00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.667
- I'm just... I'm confused.

110
00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:00.375
You have so many other options.

111
00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:02.500
you know. like
uh. David. your TA.

112
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.542
he would love something
like this.

113
00:06:04.542 --> 00:06:05.833
- Yes. yes. David is driven.

114
00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:08.583
but you'd benefit
from this the most.

115
00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:10.583
- Professor. I am flattered.

116
00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:12.542
but I just. I have so much
on my plate right now.

117
00:06:12.542 --> 00:06:16.375
- Ashley. listen to me.
you have more talent

118
00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:18.708
than any student
that has ever passed

119
00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:22.625
through my lecture hall doors
in over 30 years of teaching.

120
00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:24.875
That doesn't come by too often.

121
00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:29.583
Being under the wing
of somebody like Miles Blake

122
00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:33.750
could be all that's standing
between you and your dream.

123
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.083
- Okay.

124
00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:36.375
- All right.

125
00:06:40.875 --> 00:06:42.708
- I'm assuming by the look
on your face

126
00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:44.250
that he told you
the wonderful news.

127
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.583
- Hi. David.

128
00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:48.292
I... didn't want to--
- You didn't want

129
00:06:48.292 --> 00:06:49.875
the opportunity of a lifetime?

130
00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:51.458
Is that what you were
going to say?

131
00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:53.167
- No. I meant--
- Because that would make him

132
00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:54.542
choosing you over me
even worse.

133
00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:56.458
- Look. I'm sorry. David.

134
00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:59.417
- Hey. hey. um. listen.

135
00:06:59.417 --> 00:07:01.667
I'm just giving you a hard time.

136
00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:03.542
You gotta learn
how to take a joke. Ash.

137
00:07:03.542 --> 00:07:05.542
No. I'm... I'm. you know.
I'm swamped

138
00:07:05.542 --> 00:07:07.583
with Professor Dorr's
classes anyways.

139
00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:09.750
That's uh... You know.
that's probably why he chose you

140
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.542
over me in the
first place. yeah.

141
00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:13.167
He didn't wanna lose his TA.

142
00:07:15.708 --> 00:07:19.542
By the way. I um...
I read your chapters.

143
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.208
- You did what?

144
00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:25.708
- Yeah. they were just uh.
sitting there on his desk.

145
00:07:25.708 --> 00:07:28.667
I thought they were
an underclassman's project
or something.

146
00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:31.500
Oh the... that's not...
that's not what I meant.

147
00:07:32.542 --> 00:07:34.625
Yeah. the pages were great.

148
00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:36.958
There's just one thing missing.

149
00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:39.167
- Yeah? What was that?

150
00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:43.042
- You need a more
threatening villain.

151
00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:45.625
A better adversary.

152
00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:49.917
(eerie music)

153
00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:02.750
- He actually said that?
- I know. right?

154
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.917
And the creepy thing
was he didn't even seem

155
00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.542
like he was talking
about my book.

156
00:08:06.542 --> 00:08:08.750
Like it was some sort of threat.
or something.

157
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.750
- Okay. you need to introduce me
to this little boy

158
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.167
'cause I'll put him
in his place.

159
00:08:12.167 --> 00:08:13.083
(laughing)

160
00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:16.208
Anyway. I'm sure
he's just jealous.

161
00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:19.417
I mean. you get to work
with "the" Miles Blake.

162
00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:21.708
- It's not that big of a deal.
- Oh. come on!

163
00:08:21.708 --> 00:08:24.708
I bet you have a copy of one of
his books in your bag right now.

164
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.083
(sighing)

165
00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:31.125
(laughing)
Thank you.

166
00:08:31.125 --> 00:08:32.500
Wow!

167
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.292
He's handsome.

168
00:08:34.292 --> 00:08:37.417
Writers aren't supposed to be
that handsome. Ashley!

169
00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:40.375
- Okay.
- Maybe you'll fall in love

170
00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:42.583
and make best-selling author
babies together.

171
00:08:42.583 --> 00:08:44.583
- That is the last thing
I am looking for right now.

172
00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:46.500
I'm just gonna try to soak up
all the knowledge

173
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.875
and experience that I can.

174
00:08:47.875 --> 00:08:49.625
He probably won't even talk
to me that much.

175
00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:51.833
- Can I keep this?
- No.

176
00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:53.542
- Oh. come on.
- Well. enough about me.

177
00:08:53.542 --> 00:08:55.625
How's your last semester
of criminal justice going?

178
00:08:56.708 --> 00:08:59.542
- It's taken a dark turn
this semester.

179
00:08:59.542 --> 00:09:02.208
- How so?
- Another internship.

180
00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.208
some on-the-job education.

181
00:09:04.208 --> 00:09:05.500
- Okay. where?

182
00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:09.375
- What's the last place
you once said you'd ever
wanna be locked in?

183
00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:12.208
- No!
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:16.042
This girl's gonna be
spending her last semester
in the town morgue.

185
00:09:16.042 --> 00:09:18.208
- I suppose if you're gonna be
a detective. you do have

186
00:09:18.208 --> 00:09:20.500
to get used to looking at
dead bodies. right? But still.

187
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.708
- It is what it is.
I'll be a fly on the wall

188
00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:24.875
for any criminal investigative
biopsies. you know.

189
00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:26.875
- And you'll tell your best
friend everything?

190
00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:29.958
Maybe some inspiration
for her future stories?

191
00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.042
- Hmm. Only if you give me
that book!

192
00:09:32.042 --> 00:09:33.625
- No!
- Come on!

193
00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:35.750
But if I ever meet him.
he's fair game.

194
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.917
- All right. okay. Sure.
(laughing)

195
00:09:37.917 --> 00:09:39.542
- Sure? What do you mean sure?

196
00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:40.792
- I'm just saying.

197
00:09:40.792 --> 00:09:42.042
- I mean what I say.

198
00:09:42.042 --> 00:09:44.000
- We'll see about that.
We'll see.

199
00:10:01.292 --> 00:10:02.708
- Too much?

200
00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:06.542
You know. I worry
with the younger college crowd

201
00:10:06.542 --> 00:10:08.417
that most likely haven't read
my books.

202
00:10:08.417 --> 00:10:10.917
they won't take me seriously
unless they actually
see the work.

203
00:10:10.917 --> 00:10:14.667
- Oh. I think everyone in this
class will know who you are.

204
00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:16.708
Um. I like the books.

205
00:10:16.708 --> 00:10:18.417
It's a good touch.

206
00:10:18.917 --> 00:10:21.792
- Miles Blake.
- Ashley... Ashley Dunn.

207
00:10:21.792 --> 00:10:24.375
- Ah. the prodigy.
Nice to finally meet you.

208
00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:26.125
- Prodigy? I...

209
00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:28.833
- Professor Dorr is uh.
is pretty proud.

210
00:10:28.833 --> 00:10:31.042
- I am so sorry.
I did not know that he was

211
00:10:31.042 --> 00:10:33.167
going to give you
those chapters.

212
00:10:33.167 --> 00:10:34.125
- Ashley...

213
00:10:35.208 --> 00:10:36.375
They were brilliant.

214
00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:39.958
You know. I gotta admit. I get
asked to read short stories.

215
00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.833
chapters. full on manuscripts.
pretty much everywhere I go.

216
00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:44.875
so when he put those
on my desk with a smile.

217
00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:47.042
it was a little...
- Cringy?

218
00:10:47.042 --> 00:10:50.042
- Yeah. a little bit. but I told
him I'd read 'em as a courtesy.

219
00:10:50.042 --> 00:10:52.792
You know. rarely do the pages
actually ever live up

220
00:10:52.792 --> 00:10:56.542
to the hype. but you...

221
00:10:56.542 --> 00:10:59.792
Your voice.
your narrative structure.

222
00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:04.750
your syntax. I mean.
it's... mesmerizing.

223
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.167
Impressive.

224
00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:09.000
- Thank you.

225
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.042
Um... I've worked
really hard on them.

226
00:11:11.042 --> 00:11:12.750
- I like that.

227
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.208
It's a strength to know
how to take a compliment

228
00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:17.375
and they come very rarely
when you're first starting out.

229
00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:20.083
Even less so from
the critics' corner when
you're actually published.

230
00:11:20.083 --> 00:11:22.000
- I get that from Professor Dorr
all the time.

231
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.042
- Well. he's a wise man.
- Yes. he is.

232
00:11:25.042 --> 00:11:28.042
- So. all I need from you
is some basic assistance.

233
00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:30.375
uh. fielding students'
questions.

234
00:11:30.375 --> 00:11:32.750
help with the assignments
when they get turned in.

235
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.167
you know. I could use
some extra eyes on 'em.

236
00:11:37.542 --> 00:11:39.667
Come on!
- Sorry?

237
00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:43.875
- Let's go for a walk.
- Oh.

238
00:11:47.417 --> 00:11:51.208
- And you have writers that
are far more talented than me

239
00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:53.958
that never got to see
their dreams come true

240
00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.792
because the universe
had different plans for 'em

241
00:11:56.792 --> 00:12:01.625
or they didn't take
the opportunities that were
in front of 'em. but I'm...

242
00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:03.708
I'm really glad that
you took this one.

243
00:12:03.708 --> 00:12:06.333
I mean. who knows?
You might be looking out

244
00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:08.792
in a sea of hundreds
of your fans soon.

245
00:12:08.792 --> 00:12:11.083
waiting for you
to sign your bestseller.

246
00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:13.750
(sighing)
- That's the dream.

247
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.500
Hopefully no stalkers. though.

248
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.958
- Ah. My second book.

249
00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.625
You read that too. I assume?

250
00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:21.208
- I've read all of them.

251
00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:24.125
You know. I've always wondered.
is that a true story?

252
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.042
- I've had my share
of uniquely devoted fans.

253
00:12:28.042 --> 00:12:30.458
but nothing that me or
my publicist couldn't handle.

254
00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.458
(chuckling)

255
00:12:37.583 --> 00:12:40.167
(sighing)
And here we are.

256
00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:42.708
Took you from one side
of the campus to the next.

257
00:12:42.708 --> 00:12:44.417
- You get to stay here?

258
00:12:44.417 --> 00:12:47.167
- Well. more importantly.
I actually get to write here.

259
00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:49.500
You know. when I'm not teaching.
of course.

260
00:12:50.042 --> 00:12:52.458
You know. between you and I.

261
00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:56.542
I had two very specific
deal-breaking requests
in my contract.

262
00:12:56.542 --> 00:13:00.792
One. a unique house of my own
with room and board.

263
00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:05.875
And two. teacher's assistant
to pick up the extra work.

264
00:13:05.875 --> 00:13:08.083
so I could actually write
in said home.

265
00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:12.833
This... is where I'm gonna write
my next bestseller.

266
00:13:14.208 --> 00:13:16.542
- Your new book.
what's it about?

267
00:13:16.542 --> 00:13:18.375
- I don't know.

268
00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:20.042
Hasn't told me yet.

269
00:13:21.542 --> 00:13:23.375
See ya in class.

270
00:13:25.458 --> 00:13:27.250
(eerie music)

271
00:13:44.417 --> 00:13:46.042
- Hey!

272
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.208
You okay?
- Yeah. I guess.

273
00:13:49.208 --> 00:13:52.042
- Is there a problem?
- Not yet.

274
00:13:52.042 --> 00:13:53.417
- I suggest you keep
walking then.

275
00:13:55.208 --> 00:13:57.333
- Thanks.
- No problem.

276
00:14:04.292 --> 00:14:06.875
(indistinct chatter)

277
00:14:06.875 --> 00:14:09.083
- It helps get more money.
it helps with clean up.

278
00:14:09.083 --> 00:14:11.667
- Guess it adds to something.
- Um. Mr. Blake?

279
00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:14.375
Sorry to interrupt.
Hi. Ashley.

280
00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:15.875
- Hi. David.

281
00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:19.042
- Uh. I... I just wanna say
that I... I'm a big fan.

282
00:14:19.042 --> 00:14:22.542
I read all of your books.
a few times over. and I...

283
00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:25.583
I read your book on writing.
as well. So inspiring.

284
00:14:25.583 --> 00:14:28.125
And I've actually written
seven novels myself.

285
00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:30.000
I started when I was 15.

286
00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:34.042
- Very nice to hear.
Congratulations on the writing.

287
00:14:34.042 --> 00:14:36.583
If you'll excuse me. we have
a class to get started.

288
00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:38.083
It was nice to meet you.

289
00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:46.375
I see two types
of people out there.

290
00:14:48.917 --> 00:14:51.167
Those of you who are looking
to learn a thing or two

291
00:14:51.167 --> 00:14:53.042
about the murder mystery genre

292
00:14:53.042 --> 00:14:55.958
and those of you who are looking
for an easy credit.

293
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.917
But each and every one of you
share one thing in common.

294
00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:05.667
We... love... a good mystery.

295
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.500
Since the dawn of mankind.
we have been sharing stories

296
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.917
of mystery. and intrigue.

297
00:15:12.917 --> 00:15:16.750
and none of those stories
capture our imagination

298
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.958
more than those involving...
(groaning)

299
00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.500
Murder!
(laughter)

300
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.958
But why do we kill. right?

301
00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:31.042
What drives somebody
to commit murder?

302
00:15:32.667 --> 00:15:34.125
It's our greatest mystery.

303
00:15:34.125 --> 00:15:36.042
(footsteps thudding)

304
00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:39.750
- Can I help you?
- Hey!

305
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.417
Did you write those books?

306
00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:45.708
- Yes. Yes. I did. Let me
guess. you didn't like 'em.

307
00:15:45.708 --> 00:15:47.167
- Miles?

308
00:15:48.458 --> 00:15:50.458
- Hey. man. not here.

309
00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:52.958
- You need to get
outta my face right now.

310
00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.875
- I thought I told you
to keep walking?

311
00:15:54.875 --> 00:15:56.792
- Whoa. gentlemen. please!

312
00:15:56.792 --> 00:16:00.417
- Every time you come here.
you're trying to start stuff.

313
00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:03.333
- Now I have a problem
with you. sport.

314
00:16:04.375 --> 00:16:05.875
(groaning)

315
00:16:05.875 --> 00:16:07.333
(gasping and exclaiming)

316
00:16:16.125 --> 00:16:18.625
(chuckling)
- Ladies and gentlemen.

317
00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:21.792
Jonathan Hansen and Liam Rodgers
of the theater department.

318
00:16:21.792 --> 00:16:23.708
(applause)

319
00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:26.500
Come on. give it up.

320
00:16:27.042 --> 00:16:30.208
Every murder mystery
has set-ups.

321
00:16:30.208 --> 00:16:32.583
shocking surprises. right?

322
00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:36.125
Now. some of you saw Mr. Hansen
when he walked in. right?

323
00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:38.083
His disheveled. mysterious.
no offense.

324
00:16:38.083 --> 00:16:40.375
somewhat creepy appearance.

325
00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.500
Captured your attention. right?

326
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.333
If only for a moment.

327
00:16:45.333 --> 00:16:47.042
Who was he?

328
00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:52.708
Did he belong in this class?
If not. why not?

329
00:16:52.708 --> 00:16:58.333
Was I going to be the product
of a truly deranged individual

330
00:16:58.333 --> 00:17:00.958
who is hellbent
on killing me. huh?

331
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.583
Was he a. uh... I don't know.

332
00:17:04.583 --> 00:17:07.458
an overzealous fan entranced
by my brilliance?

333
00:17:07.458 --> 00:17:09.875
Something I may have written
about in my second book.

334
00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:11.750
for those of you loyal readers.

335
00:17:12.917 --> 00:17:14.542
And also...

336
00:17:17.292 --> 00:17:19.417
Who is this knight
in metaphorical shining armor.

337
00:17:19.417 --> 00:17:21.208
who came to save the day?
(chuckling)

338
00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:23.583
Huh? Now. that...

339
00:17:25.167 --> 00:17:28.750
that. my fellow writers...

340
00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:32.375
and easy credit seekers.

341
00:17:32.375 --> 00:17:37.708
is what makes the murder mystery
genre so enthralling

342
00:17:37.708 --> 00:17:44.167
for readers. and what makes
writing them so much fun.

343
00:17:47.542 --> 00:17:50.208
That's what I hope
to teach you in this class.

344
00:17:50.208 --> 00:17:51.875
Let's give it up
for these two. huh?

345
00:17:51.875 --> 00:17:54.583
(applause)

346
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.417
- He's amazing. isn't he?

347
00:18:06.417 --> 00:18:09.292
Brilliant. Just a...
a single class with him

348
00:18:09.292 --> 00:18:12.250
has me rethinking
everything I've written.

349
00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.875
Can you believe the...
the adrenaline

350
00:18:14.875 --> 00:18:17.083
of watching someone
commit murder?

351
00:18:17.083 --> 00:18:19.458
I mean didn't it send chills
through your bones?

352
00:18:19.458 --> 00:18:22.250
- Maybe not for the same reasons
as you. but uh...

353
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:23.958
(phone chiming)
Sorry.

354
00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:28.333
Oh. I'm sorry. David.
I have to go meet someone.
but have a great night.

355
00:18:36.167 --> 00:18:38.208
(♪)

356
00:18:40.375 --> 00:18:43.125
- You need to learn
to charge that thing.

357
00:18:43.125 --> 00:18:44.833
You're gonna be stranded
without it.

358
00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.333
(laughing)

359
00:18:49.417 --> 00:18:52.292
- Seriously though. it was...
it was so disturbing.

360
00:18:52.292 --> 00:18:56.542
but thrilling at the same time.
Like. which I hate to admit.

361
00:18:56.542 --> 00:18:59.375
David was a little
too thrilled. though.

362
00:18:59.375 --> 00:19:01.958
- That doesn't surprise me.
(sighing)

363
00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:04.750
- I just can't fathom
seeing something like that.

364
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.792
Like. I've never even seen
a dead body.

365
00:19:06.792 --> 00:19:08.958
I can't imagine what
you're seeing in the morgue.

366
00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:10.417
- Ugh. nothing yet.

367
00:19:10.417 --> 00:19:12.208
I mean. that's a good thing.

368
00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:17.042
But let's forget about
dead bodies. and uh...

369
00:19:17.042 --> 00:19:22.708
tell me about Professor Handsome
and your little walk together.

370
00:19:22.708 --> 00:19:24.417
- I told you.
it's not like that.

371
00:19:24.417 --> 00:19:26.208
It's all about the work.

372
00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:28.458
He... he told me how
he got started and it...

373
00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:30.583
it gave me hope.
Made me feel worthy.

374
00:19:30.583 --> 00:19:33.958
Like. I got home and the words
just kept flowing.

375
00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:37.042
It... it felt like he kicked
a door open for me. you know.

376
00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:39.292
Like. the chapters
just kept coming.

377
00:19:39.292 --> 00:19:40.750
and I can't stop it's...

378
00:19:41.458 --> 00:19:44.750
- Ooh. speaking
of kicking in doors...

379
00:19:46.167 --> 00:19:48.667
- Well. I didn't expect
to see you here.

380
00:19:49.542 --> 00:19:52.292
Shouldn't you be writing?
- Shouldn't you?

381
00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:57.000
- I guess we writers do have
to eat and drink.

382
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.458
(laughing)

383
00:19:58.458 --> 00:20:01.375
- Oh. um. sorry. Miles Blake.

384
00:20:01.375 --> 00:20:03.500
this is my best friend. Jordan.
- Hi.

385
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.208
Nice to finally meet you.

386
00:20:05.208 --> 00:20:06.792
It's an honor.

387
00:20:06.792 --> 00:20:08.333
- Oh. no. honor's all mine.

388
00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.083
Any friend of Ashley's.

389
00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:11.667
Can I get you anything?

390
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.208
What do you say.
a round on me?

391
00:20:15.208 --> 00:20:16.792
- Oh. let's do this.

392
00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:20.708
(indistinct chatter)

393
00:20:20.708 --> 00:20:23.250
- It seems like. you know.
you go in the big city.

394
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.250
you just drink
all night long. right?

395
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.000
It doesn't seem fair.

396
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.958
All right. have a good night.

397
00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.625
- Good night.

398
00:20:31.042 --> 00:20:32.500
(giggling)
- Come on.

399
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.333
- I could run right now.

400
00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:36.208
I could run six miles.
(laughing)

401
00:20:37.042 --> 00:20:39.000
- That was beautiful.
- Thanks.

402
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.750
- That was beautiful.
(laughing)

403
00:20:41.708 --> 00:20:42.708
- Oh. you know...

404
00:20:54.792 --> 00:20:56.208
(sighing)

405
00:21:09.875 --> 00:21:11.875
(ominous music)

406
00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:18.708
(grunts)

407
00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:21.792
(grunts)

408
00:21:21.792 --> 00:21:25.250
(breathing heavily)

409
00:21:47.917 --> 00:21:51.750
- Details. We have to be
thinking about those details.

410
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.375
Now. I want you
to see the story.

411
00:21:53.375 --> 00:21:56.625
not only through the eyes
of the victim of the murder.

412
00:21:56.625 --> 00:21:58.917
but through the killer's eyes
as well.

413
00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:00.708
Now. how do we do that?

414
00:22:00.708 --> 00:22:04.417
How do we capture the reality
of what it's like

415
00:22:04.417 --> 00:22:06.500
to murder somebody

416
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.708
and give the reader
that authentic experience?

417
00:22:15.458 --> 00:22:17.333
That's a trick
question. folks.

418
00:22:17.333 --> 00:22:18.500
(chuckling)
I mean...

419
00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:21.875
I mean. we need to do more
than research. right?

420
00:22:21.875 --> 00:22:24.292
I mean. in a...
in an ideal world.

421
00:22:24.292 --> 00:22:26.083
we'd just commit
the murder ourselves.

422
00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:30.833
That's the only way to offer
the reader true authenticity.

423
00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:35.500
But we are not going to be
that dedicated to our work.

424
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.208
my young writers. right?

425
00:22:38.208 --> 00:22:39.833
I need to hear a verbal yes.

426
00:22:39.833 --> 00:22:41.708
(students agreeing)
Yes. yes. yes. yes. okay.

427
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.083
Uh. yeah?

428
00:22:44.083 --> 00:22:46.208
Uh... Derek. right?

429
00:22:46.208 --> 00:22:48.375
- Um. David.
David Freeman.

430
00:22:48.375 --> 00:22:49.625
- Yeah. David.
What's up?

431
00:22:49.625 --> 00:22:52.208
- I read your book on writing.

432
00:22:52.208 --> 00:22:56.250
You... you mentioned that when
you were first starting out.

433
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.833
you would pick a random person
from a crowd

434
00:22:57.833 --> 00:23:01.708
and follow them at night.
trying to remain unseen.

435
00:23:01.708 --> 00:23:04.125
Is that close enough
to authenticity?

436
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.792
- Uh. guilty as charged.

437
00:23:07.792 --> 00:23:09.708
Let that be a lesson
to everybody.

438
00:23:09.708 --> 00:23:11.500
Be careful of the stories
you tell about yourself

439
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.333
because they will come back
to haunt you.

440
00:23:14.958 --> 00:23:16.833
But yeah. if...

441
00:23:16.833 --> 00:23:21.875
in my early days of anonymity
I did partake in that odd.

442
00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:26.375
and let's just call it out.
creepy exercise.

443
00:23:26.375 --> 00:23:29.833
but uh. yeah. no I...
I found a new way.

444
00:23:31.458 --> 00:23:37.125
Controlled and...
appropriate environment.

445
00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:41.625
In here.

446
00:23:45.417 --> 00:23:48.042
We're writers. aren't we?

447
00:23:48.042 --> 00:23:52.042
We use our imagination
to conjure the unthinkable.

448
00:23:52.042 --> 00:23:56.583
And since our readers.
most of them at least.

449
00:23:56.583 --> 00:24:00.375
don't know what it's like
to murder someone.

450
00:24:00.375 --> 00:24:03.542
authenticity is debatable.

451
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:10.167
Now with that. I have
your first assignment.

452
00:24:12.583 --> 00:24:15.375
How do any of you expect
to write a good book

453
00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:17.458
about murder mystery
if none of you know

454
00:24:17.458 --> 00:24:20.750
how the killer
does the dark deed?

455
00:24:21.542 --> 00:24:24.208
The devil is in
the details. folks.

456
00:24:24.208 --> 00:24:30.000
So. I want each and every one
of you to do the unthinkable.

457
00:24:30.875 --> 00:24:35.958
I want you to plan
the perfect murder.

458
00:24:36.708 --> 00:24:40.708
Three pages. No more. No less.

459
00:24:48.167 --> 00:24:51.375
(panting)

460
00:24:51.375 --> 00:24:53.167
- How are you not dying
right now?

461
00:24:53.167 --> 00:24:54.583
(sighing)

462
00:24:54.583 --> 00:24:56.042
- I told you it'd be tough.

463
00:24:56.833 --> 00:25:01.375
Try doing this after a 2.4 mile
swim and 100 miles on a bike.

464
00:25:01.375 --> 00:25:03.125
- If there is a swim
involved in this.

465
00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:05.333
then we are not friends anymore.
(laughing)

466
00:25:06.042 --> 00:25:09.375
(sighing)
- So. you're gonna have a class

467
00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:11.208
full of potential
murderers. then?

468
00:25:11.208 --> 00:25:12.750
- It's just an assignment.

469
00:25:13.667 --> 00:25:16.458
- How would you do it?
- Do what?

470
00:25:16.458 --> 00:25:17.500
- Kill me.

471
00:25:18.208 --> 00:25:21.000
- Well. after this workout
you just put me through.

472
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.875
I'd make sure it was slow
and very. very painful.

473
00:25:25.875 --> 00:25:28.042
(laughing)
- Like your run out there today?

474
00:25:28.042 --> 00:25:29.125
- Okay. okay.

475
00:25:33.375 --> 00:25:35.250
(knocking on door)

476
00:25:40.708 --> 00:25:43.875
- Pretty jumpy for a woman
who writes murder so well.

477
00:25:50.833 --> 00:25:52.542
(sighing)
Thanks for coming

478
00:25:52.542 --> 00:25:54.000
all the way across campus.

479
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.750
I thought it'd be
more comfortable to read in here

480
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.375
than some small office
or cold lecture hall.

481
00:25:58.375 --> 00:26:00.375
Can I get you anything to drink?

482
00:26:00.375 --> 00:26:03.042
Coffee. wine?
- No. thanks.

483
00:26:03.042 --> 00:26:07.292
- All right. well.
sorry for the uh. hard copies.

484
00:26:07.292 --> 00:26:10.042
I know your generation has an
affinity for all things digital.

485
00:26:10.042 --> 00:26:14.625
but uh. there is just something
pure about reading actual paper.

486
00:26:15.292 --> 00:26:16.917
- Professor Dorr would agree.

487
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.083
- Mm-hmm. He and I
have a lot in common.

488
00:26:22.208 --> 00:26:23.292
Including you.

489
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.542
By the way.
how's your writing going?

490
00:26:31.167 --> 00:26:33.625
Oh. I know that look well.

491
00:26:35.125 --> 00:26:37.750
- It's practically
writing itself.

492
00:26:39.292 --> 00:26:41.917
- Well. shall we?

493
00:26:41.917 --> 00:26:42.958
- We shall.

494
00:26:46.042 --> 00:26:49.042
(soft music)

495
00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:10.083
So. what'd you think?
Any standouts?

496
00:27:10.083 --> 00:27:12.542
- Hmm. maybe some potential.
What about you?

497
00:27:12.542 --> 00:27:14.208
- Truth?

498
00:27:14.208 --> 00:27:15.958
- Always.

499
00:27:17.708 --> 00:27:20.083
- I think these people
have seen way too many movies.

500
00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:22.792
That's what I see
in their writing.

501
00:27:22.792 --> 00:27:25.750
- You know. the methodology
of a killer is the key

502
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.833
to any successful
murder mystery.

503
00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:30.708
I mean. anybody can just follow
somebody home and attack 'em.

504
00:27:30.708 --> 00:27:32.583
Sadly. we see that
happen every day.

505
00:27:32.583 --> 00:27:35.417
But what sets a great
murder mystery apart

506
00:27:35.417 --> 00:27:37.167
from all of the terrible murders

507
00:27:37.167 --> 00:27:42.042
that we see on the news
every day is... ingenuity.

508
00:27:42.042 --> 00:27:46.875
I mean. that's what makes for
a compelling fictional killer.

509
00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:50.708
- And no one captured
your imagination?

510
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:58.125
- This uh... David Freeman.

511
00:27:59.417 --> 00:28:02.083
- Professor Dorr's TA.
(chuckling)

512
00:28:02.083 --> 00:28:04.917
Yeah. the uh...
- Miles Blake superfan?

513
00:28:04.917 --> 00:28:06.000
- Hmm...

514
00:28:06.875 --> 00:28:10.167
Yeah. I run into one or two
of 'em at every event.

515
00:28:10.167 --> 00:28:14.792
Eh. they're mostly harmless.
but uh. try to steer 'em
in the right direction.

516
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.083
(eerie music)

517
00:28:42.542 --> 00:28:45.750
(ominous music)

518
00:28:52.083 --> 00:28:53.958
(sighing)

519
00:28:59.167 --> 00:29:00.708
(sighing)

520
00:29:10.375 --> 00:29:12.333
(rustling)

521
00:29:14.458 --> 00:29:17.458
(suspenseful music)

522
00:29:36.917 --> 00:29:38.792
- Hey. are you home?

523
00:29:41.625 --> 00:29:43.792
(indistinct chatter)

524
00:29:51.583 --> 00:29:52.500
(knocking on door)

525
00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:54.417
- Hey.

526
00:29:54.417 --> 00:29:56.333
Come in.
It's all right.

527
00:30:09.417 --> 00:30:12.042
See? Not that hard.

528
00:30:14.417 --> 00:30:16.250
(soft music playing)

529
00:30:31.583 --> 00:30:33.917
- I wish I had
the courage you have.

530
00:30:34.542 --> 00:30:36.417
I mean. look at me.

531
00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:39.750
I'm a wreck. I've walked
that campus for six years now.

532
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.208
I've never felt anything
like this.

533
00:30:43.083 --> 00:30:46.000
- Well. you were just
in a creepy old house.

534
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.875
- Beautiful house.
- Okay.

535
00:30:47.875 --> 00:30:51.417
Creepy. old. beautiful house.

536
00:30:51.417 --> 00:30:53.542
with the top murder
mystery author.

537
00:30:53.542 --> 00:30:56.250
reading multiple plans
for multiple murders.

538
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.542
- I suppose it could've
triggered my imagination
a little bit.

539
00:30:59.542 --> 00:31:01.083
- You're a writer.

540
00:31:01.083 --> 00:31:04.167
Conjuring scary situations
is pretty much your thing.

541
00:31:05.042 --> 00:31:08.750
Now. let's talk about
this intimate little night

542
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.042
with Professor Handsome. hmm?

543
00:31:10.042 --> 00:31:11.417
- Call him that one
more time...

544
00:31:11.417 --> 00:31:12.708
(laughing)

545
00:31:12.708 --> 00:31:14.542
It's not like that.

546
00:31:14.542 --> 00:31:17.208
He's not my type.
- Oh. right.

547
00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:21.958
Successful. charming.
talented. handsome.

548
00:31:22.667 --> 00:31:24.333
Oh. stay clear of that.

549
00:31:26.583 --> 00:31:29.000
(laughing)

550
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.833
- He was so cute though.
- Very.

551
00:31:32.542 --> 00:31:34.375
Let's head over to Fratelli's.

552
00:31:34.375 --> 00:31:36.375
Usually plenty
of cute guys there.

553
00:31:36.375 --> 00:31:39.292
- Uh. I can't.
I have an essay to finish.

554
00:31:39.292 --> 00:31:43.208
- Come on. Kate. peer pressure.

555
00:31:43.208 --> 00:31:46.708
(laughing)
- Thanks. Next time. for sure.

556
00:31:46.708 --> 00:31:48.375
- Fine. suit yourself.

557
00:31:48.375 --> 00:31:51.625
You want us to at least
walk you home first?

558
00:31:53.208 --> 00:31:55.708
- I'll be fine.
It's not that far.

559
00:31:55.708 --> 00:31:57.292
And I'll keep my phone
in my hand.

560
00:31:57.875 --> 00:32:00.042
(all): Bye!

561
00:32:09.458 --> 00:32:11.458
(phone chiming)

562
00:32:20.042 --> 00:32:21.458
(branch cracking)

563
00:32:43.958 --> 00:32:45.625
(branch cracking)

564
00:33:02.042 --> 00:33:03.625
(phone ringing)

565
00:33:06.125 --> 00:33:08.583
- Hey. What are you
doing up so early?

566
00:33:09.208 --> 00:33:12.042
- Just pulled an all-nighter
at the morgue.

567
00:33:12.042 --> 00:33:14.708
- Oh. that sounds fun.
You have any good stories?

568
00:33:16.208 --> 00:33:18.417
- A no dead body night
is a good night.

569
00:33:18.417 --> 00:33:20.125
(chuckling)
You have class today?

570
00:33:20.125 --> 00:33:22.542
- Yep. just getting
some writing done before.

571
00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:24.333
- I need coffee.
- Ditto.

572
00:33:24.333 --> 00:33:27.417
I will see you in five?
- Yep.

573
00:33:27.417 --> 00:33:33.167
But I'll warn you now.
I am in full zombie mode.

574
00:33:33.167 --> 00:33:34.792
- Not for long. See ya.

575
00:33:34.792 --> 00:33:37.667
(sirens blaring)

576
00:33:46.083 --> 00:33:48.750
- Mm. that is so good.

577
00:33:49.875 --> 00:33:52.500
(phones chiming)

578
00:33:54.208 --> 00:33:56.125
- What's going on?
(phone chiming)

579
00:34:00.542 --> 00:34:02.000
- Look!

580
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.792
- Police investigators
have confirmed

581
00:34:03.792 --> 00:34:06.125
that a university student
has been reported missing

582
00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:07.708
since last weekend.

583
00:34:07.708 --> 00:34:10.542
Freshman Kate Bishop
was last seen this past Friday

584
00:34:10.542 --> 00:34:13.708
as she said goodbye
to friends for the short
walk home to the dorms.

585
00:34:13.708 --> 00:34:16.125
Her roommate reported her
missing yesterday morning.

586
00:34:16.125 --> 00:34:17.417
which means her whereabouts

587
00:34:17.417 --> 00:34:19.750
have been unknown
for nearly 72 hours.

588
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.333
Campus police are working
with police investigators

589
00:34:22.333 --> 00:34:24.792
as the search
has officially begun.

590
00:34:32.708 --> 00:34:35.375
- Hey.
- Hmm.

591
00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:39.333
- Oh wow. what happened?
- Oh. yeah. shaving.

592
00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:42.542
Up really late writing.

593
00:34:42.542 --> 00:34:45.375
Didn't get much sleep.
Must've dozed off during
the morning shave.

594
00:34:45.375 --> 00:34:47.125
It's fascinating
how such a small.

595
00:34:47.125 --> 00:34:49.458
superficial cut
can bleed so much.

596
00:34:51.208 --> 00:34:53.208
- Did you hear about
the missing student?

597
00:34:53.208 --> 00:34:55.167
- Missing student?

598
00:34:55.167 --> 00:34:57.333
- Yeah. it's all over
the news and online.

599
00:34:57.333 --> 00:34:59.708
- I turn all that stuff off
when I'm writing.

600
00:34:59.708 --> 00:35:01.292
What happened?

601
00:35:01.292 --> 00:35:02.917
- She's been missing
since Friday.

602
00:35:02.917 --> 00:35:05.417
Went out with some friends.
walked home alone and...

603
00:35:06.375 --> 00:35:09.375
- Oh. my God. that's a shame.
Did you know her?

604
00:35:09.375 --> 00:35:11.833
- Do I know her?
Um. no. I...

605
00:35:11.833 --> 00:35:14.458
I suppose I've seen her
on campus a few times.
but we've never met.

606
00:35:14.458 --> 00:35:19.708
Hopefully she just...
went home or something.

607
00:35:19.708 --> 00:35:21.708
Forgot to tell someone?

608
00:35:21.708 --> 00:35:25.792
- Hmm. nice alternative. but...
probably not likely the case.

609
00:35:25.792 --> 00:35:28.042
Hey. be careful out there. okay?

610
00:35:28.042 --> 00:35:29.958
That's horrible.

611
00:35:29.958 --> 00:35:31.625
- Thanks. I will.

612
00:35:34.208 --> 00:35:36.750
Wow. you're usually
the first one in class.

613
00:35:37.375 --> 00:35:39.750
Are you okay?
You look kinda...

614
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.667
- Yeah. must've just caught
a bug. or something.

615
00:35:41.667 --> 00:35:43.500
- All right. everybody.

616
00:35:44.875 --> 00:35:46.333
I know I look a little tired.

617
00:35:47.208 --> 00:35:49.042
Spent all weekend
reading your stories

618
00:35:49.042 --> 00:35:50.750
on how you plan
to murder people.

619
00:35:51.625 --> 00:35:55.125
Look. you know. for your first
assignment. not bad. right.

620
00:35:55.125 --> 00:35:57.792
but this is the dark
manifestations of the mind

621
00:35:57.792 --> 00:35:59.792
and how to harness them.
so we just need to learn

622
00:35:59.792 --> 00:36:01.542
how to harness these ideas
that you guys come up...

623
00:36:04.583 --> 00:36:06.542
(retching)

624
00:36:11.708 --> 00:36:14.625
(breathing heavily)

625
00:36:30.792 --> 00:36:32.583
- Hello?!

626
00:36:37.417 --> 00:36:39.458
Please!

627
00:36:41.875 --> 00:36:46.333
I'm sure my... my family's
worried about me!

628
00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:52.667
- Hi.
- Oh. hey.

629
00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:56.875
Whatcha got there?
- I... Gosh. the words

630
00:36:56.875 --> 00:36:58.542
have just been flowing.

631
00:36:58.542 --> 00:37:01.500
I reworked everything. took
a whole different turn with it.

632
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.292
It's... it's become
something else entirely.

633
00:37:03.292 --> 00:37:05.042
Something... something better.

634
00:37:05.042 --> 00:37:07.875
- They do that. don't they?
- What?

635
00:37:07.875 --> 00:37:10.833
- Your stories... they evolve.

636
00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.583
I'll read them tonight.
Maybe we can set up a dinner

637
00:37:14.583 --> 00:37:16.333
later on in the week
to talk about it.

638
00:37:17.375 --> 00:37:20.375
- Um...
- A dinner amongst peers.

639
00:37:20.375 --> 00:37:23.625
- Okay. of course. yes.
that sounds nice.

640
00:37:31.417 --> 00:37:33.292
It's been three days now.

641
00:37:33.292 --> 00:37:34.792
Almost four.

642
00:37:36.417 --> 00:37:38.667
Doesn't look good. does it?

643
00:37:48.125 --> 00:37:51.167
- You don't have to do this!

644
00:37:51.167 --> 00:37:53.250
I haven't seen your face!

645
00:37:55.833 --> 00:37:57.667
(ominous music)

646
00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:00.917
At least some water!

647
00:38:06.208 --> 00:38:08.625
At least that!

648
00:38:09.917 --> 00:38:12.833
At least give me some water!

649
00:38:15.583 --> 00:38:17.792
- It is not your job
as an author

650
00:38:17.792 --> 00:38:20.583
to give your readers
something expectant.

651
00:38:20.583 --> 00:38:25.000
No. Give them
something unexpected!

652
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.375
That's what they look for
in every book that they choose.

653
00:38:29.375 --> 00:38:32.708
and it is our duty
to provide that.

654
00:38:41.292 --> 00:38:43.208
- Thanks for walking with me.

655
00:38:43.208 --> 00:38:45.125
- Hey. strength in numbers.

656
00:38:45.125 --> 00:38:47.458
- What do you think
happened to her?

657
00:38:48.375 --> 00:38:49.792
- I don't know.

658
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.333
And I don't wanna
even imagine it.

659
00:38:53.417 --> 00:38:55.708
I need a drink.
Dinner and cocktails?

660
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.417
- Okay. I'm gonna tell you
something. but I need you

661
00:38:59.417 --> 00:39:02.417
to promise that you're not
gonna be well... you.

662
00:39:02.417 --> 00:39:04.542
- Huh. can't wait
to hear this one.

663
00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:06.708
- I have dinner plans with him.

664
00:39:06.708 --> 00:39:10.333
- I knew it. Oh. this whole
"he's not my type" thing

665
00:39:10.333 --> 00:39:12.125
that you've been
blabbing on about?

666
00:39:12.125 --> 00:39:14.375
- It's just dinner.
Between peers.

667
00:39:14.375 --> 00:39:16.375
- Between peers?

668
00:39:16.375 --> 00:39:19.667
- Two peers having dinner.
talking about writing.

669
00:39:19.667 --> 00:39:21.833
My writing. specifically.
Nothing more.

670
00:39:21.833 --> 00:39:25.042
- Oh. God. if I was at dinner
with that man.

671
00:39:25.042 --> 00:39:27.500
business would be the last thing
we would be talking about.

672
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.417
I'd be--
- Okay. okay. I get it!

673
00:39:32.042 --> 00:39:33.750
(crying)

674
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.125
- No! Please!

675
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:51.458
Come back!
I won't tell them anything.

676
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.458
(suspenseful music)

677
00:40:25.208 --> 00:40:28.417
No! No! Please!

678
00:40:28.417 --> 00:40:30.875
Please! Come back!

679
00:40:34.708 --> 00:40:36.750
(soft jazz music)

680
00:40:43.458 --> 00:40:45.250
- I'm sorry I'm late.

681
00:40:45.917 --> 00:40:47.500
Your book wouldn't let me go.

682
00:40:51.542 --> 00:40:53.125
I'm blown away.

683
00:40:53.125 --> 00:40:54.500
- Really?

684
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.750
- Really.

685
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:58.375
I want to take this
to my publisher.

686
00:40:58.375 --> 00:41:01.208
Right away. Seriously.
they're that good.

687
00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:03.750
- You're sure? I mean.
I feel like I was kind of going

688
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:07.125
off the beaten path and...
- That's what I liked about it!

689
00:41:07.125 --> 00:41:09.542
I mean. there's nothing like it.

690
00:41:09.542 --> 00:41:11.458
And that villain...

691
00:41:13.792 --> 00:41:16.250
- Well. there has
to be something.

692
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:19.375
You say it yourself. Professor
Dorr says it all the time.

693
00:41:19.375 --> 00:41:22.042
criticism is invaluable
as a writer.

694
00:41:22.042 --> 00:41:26.125
Critique the work. please.
Just anything.

695
00:41:27.083 --> 00:41:29.708
- All right.
Fair enough.

696
00:41:31.833 --> 00:41:37.625
You could push the envelope
even further. if you're willing.

697
00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:40.875
- I am. I really am.

698
00:41:40.875 --> 00:41:42.500
- All right.

699
00:41:44.542 --> 00:41:48.083
If it's missing anything.
it's um...

700
00:41:53.208 --> 00:41:54.500
- What?

701
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.583
- You haven't fully
tapped into the realistic
dynamics of murder.

702
00:42:00.583 --> 00:42:02.167
Not just how
the captive victim feels.

703
00:42:02.167 --> 00:42:05.208
but how the killer feels.
as well. all right?

704
00:42:05.208 --> 00:42:10.667
There is a thrill of getting
into the mind of a killer.

705
00:42:10.667 --> 00:42:13.542
Seeing what they see.

706
00:42:13.542 --> 00:42:15.500
Feeling what they feel.

707
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.042
You have to tap into that

708
00:42:18.042 --> 00:42:21.792
and go to those
uncomfortable places.

709
00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:26.250
- How do I do that?

710
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:33.000
- I want you to think
about Kate.

711
00:42:36.292 --> 00:42:38.375
The missing student.

712
00:42:38.375 --> 00:42:40.208
- What?

713
00:42:40.208 --> 00:42:42.292
- Look... statistically.

714
00:42:42.292 --> 00:42:45.000
if somebody's been missing
for more than 48 hours.

715
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.875
it most likely means
they're dead. right?

716
00:42:46.875 --> 00:42:49.583
So. that usually points
to homicide.

717
00:42:49.583 --> 00:42:53.042
So. I want you to not only
put yourself

718
00:42:53.042 --> 00:42:55.708
in Kate's mind frame
upon abduction.

719
00:42:55.708 --> 00:42:59.917
but also the possible killer's
mind frame as well.

720
00:43:04.583 --> 00:43:08.000
The possibilities
are enthralling.

721
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.708
That is where you push
the envelope.

722
00:43:11.708 --> 00:43:14.708
You just have to conjure up
what happened to her.

723
00:43:14.708 --> 00:43:16.875
You capture that.

724
00:43:16.875 --> 00:43:18.917
put that on the pages...

725
00:43:20.375 --> 00:43:22.333
...you have a bestseller.

726
00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:24.833
(eerie music)

727
00:43:29.083 --> 00:43:30.458
I'm sorry.

728
00:43:30.458 --> 00:43:32.375
- Oh no. it's okay.
It's um...

729
00:43:32.375 --> 00:43:34.833
- Oh. no. no. no.
It's not. I'm...

730
00:43:35.792 --> 00:43:38.375
Look. I get like this
when I write.

731
00:43:38.375 --> 00:43:39.625
I went too far.

732
00:43:40.333 --> 00:43:41.750
I'm sorry.

733
00:43:56.417 --> 00:43:58.917
- I wanna go swimming.

734
00:43:58.917 --> 00:44:00.750
- Are you crazy?
It's freezing!

735
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:02.583
- Come on. chicken!

736
00:44:02.583 --> 00:44:04.917
Hey. I know a way we can
keep each other warm.

737
00:44:07.792 --> 00:44:09.292
Coming. or not?

738
00:44:13.458 --> 00:44:14.708
What's wrong?

739
00:44:14.708 --> 00:44:16.958
Lexi. come back over here.

740
00:44:16.958 --> 00:44:18.792
Why? We're just
gonna go swimming.

741
00:44:18.792 --> 00:44:20.583
- Seriously. Lexi!

742
00:44:20.583 --> 00:44:22.792
There's something over there.

743
00:44:26.625 --> 00:44:28.792
(screaming)

744
00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.042
(phone ringing)

745
00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:48.458
- I'm home. Alone.

746
00:44:48.458 --> 00:44:50.333
No Professor Handsome in sight.

747
00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:54.000
- Turn on your TV.

748
00:44:56.917 --> 00:44:59.333
- Authorities have confirmed
that the body

749
00:44:59.333 --> 00:45:01.667
is that of Kate Bishop.

750
00:45:01.667 --> 00:45:05.083
the university freshman that
went missing just last weekend.

751
00:45:05.083 --> 00:45:08.083
Student ID
and other identification

752
00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:10.208
were found near the body.

753
00:45:11.458 --> 00:45:13.375
- I'm glad you're safe.

754
00:45:13.375 --> 00:45:17.917
- I'm fine. It's um...
It's Kate. the missing student.

755
00:45:18.708 --> 00:45:20.208
They've already
identified her body.

756
00:45:20.208 --> 00:45:22.042
- Oh. my God.

757
00:45:41.667 --> 00:45:44.000
- Now. as a visitor
to your university.

758
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.042
I just wanna offer my deepest
condolences to you all.

759
00:45:47.042 --> 00:45:50.542
I can't imagine what you all
are feeling right now and...

760
00:45:50.542 --> 00:45:52.250
I um...

761
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.542
I've decided to postpone classes
for the rest of the week.

762
00:45:56.542 --> 00:45:59.458
in Kate's honor. to give you
all an opportunity to.

763
00:45:59.458 --> 00:46:00.958
you know. mourn her passing.

764
00:46:01.875 --> 00:46:05.292
I am... so sorry.

765
00:46:06.583 --> 00:46:07.833
Thank you.

766
00:46:28.292 --> 00:46:31.000
- I can't. it's just...
it's so horrible.

767
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.292
I thought that they--

768
00:46:32.292 --> 00:46:34.417
- Can't believe how naïve
kids can be.

769
00:46:35.833 --> 00:46:37.792
They think they're
so invincible.

770
00:46:39.417 --> 00:46:42.208
I mean. one minute
they're drinking at a bar.

771
00:46:42.208 --> 00:46:44.042
The next. they're driving away
in their car.

772
00:46:44.042 --> 00:46:46.208
jumping into freezing
cold water. It's just...

773
00:46:47.875 --> 00:46:50.083
...so naïve!

774
00:46:50.083 --> 00:46:51.875
- Is that what you think it was?

775
00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:54.125
I mean. you said it yourself
that if they're not found

776
00:46:54.125 --> 00:46:56.208
after 48 hours.
it's likely that--

777
00:46:56.208 --> 00:46:57.875
- This is the real world.
Ashley.

778
00:46:57.875 --> 00:47:00.000
Not everything's a mystery
to be solved.

779
00:47:05.458 --> 00:47:08.208
- Have you noticed that David's
been missing from class?

780
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.875
He hasn't been there in the past
few days. and when he was.

781
00:47:11.875 --> 00:47:14.875
he seemed kind of um...
off and...

782
00:47:14.875 --> 00:47:16.417
- You're not saying...

783
00:47:17.083 --> 00:47:18.917
- No. I mean. um...

784
00:47:18.917 --> 00:47:20.375
I don't know. just...

785
00:47:21.875 --> 00:47:24.542
- There's a line you can't cross
as a writer. Ashley.

786
00:47:24.542 --> 00:47:27.250
A line where you start
to believe your own words
are reality.

787
00:47:27.875 --> 00:47:29.917
We're not detectives.

788
00:47:29.917 --> 00:47:32.542
We tell lies for a living. okay?

789
00:47:32.542 --> 00:47:34.167
Dark ones.

790
00:47:34.167 --> 00:47:36.208
- No. I think you misunderstood.

791
00:47:36.208 --> 00:47:38.250
I was just wondering
where he is.

792
00:47:39.875 --> 00:47:41.375
(sirens blaring)

793
00:48:17.375 --> 00:48:19.000
Damn it. Ashley.

794
00:48:30.708 --> 00:48:33.417
David? Hello?

795
00:49:11.417 --> 00:49:13.708
- What are you doing here?
(gasps)

796
00:49:13.708 --> 00:49:15.708
- I am so sorry.

797
00:49:15.708 --> 00:49:17.000
Um... I just walked in.

798
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.875
The door was open
when I knocked.

799
00:49:18.875 --> 00:49:20.417
so I thought
you might be in here.

800
00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:32.333
I just wanted to come
check on you.

801
00:49:32.333 --> 00:49:34.625
You haven't been
in class lately.

802
00:49:35.208 --> 00:49:38.167
- You were checking on me?
- Yeah!

803
00:49:38.167 --> 00:49:43.250
Uh. well not me. Miles...
I mean. Mr. Blake was.

804
00:49:44.167 --> 00:49:46.208
- Miles Blake
was asking about me?

805
00:49:46.208 --> 00:49:47.542
- Yeah.

806
00:49:48.083 --> 00:49:50.083
Yeah. he noticed
you hadn't been in class.

807
00:49:50.083 --> 00:49:52.125
so he wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

808
00:49:55.583 --> 00:49:57.292
- I came down with a flu.

809
00:49:57.292 --> 00:49:59.667
My immune system
has never been that great.

810
00:49:59.667 --> 00:50:01.375
back since I was a kid.

811
00:50:01.375 --> 00:50:03.708
So. when I... when I do get
sick. it hits pretty bad.

812
00:50:04.292 --> 00:50:06.042
- I'm sorry to hear that.

813
00:50:08.208 --> 00:50:10.500
- Um... Do you want...

814
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.250
Do you want some water.
something to drink?

815
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:14.250
- Oh no. I'm okay. Thanks.

816
00:50:17.083 --> 00:50:19.167
- Sorry. I know...
I know it's a mess in here.

817
00:50:19.167 --> 00:50:21.042
- No. it's um--
- I spent a few nights

818
00:50:21.042 --> 00:50:22.708
at the university hospital.

819
00:50:22.708 --> 00:50:26.083
They saw how dehydrated I was
and it was pretty bad. so.

820
00:50:26.083 --> 00:50:28.542
You know. I normally
clean up during the week

821
00:50:28.542 --> 00:50:30.167
and I missed that.
obviously. so.

822
00:50:30.167 --> 00:50:33.167
- So. you're just getting
back today?

823
00:50:39.833 --> 00:50:43.042
- Yeah. I'm still a little weak.

824
00:50:43.917 --> 00:50:45.542
On the mend. though.

825
00:50:49.458 --> 00:50:51.375
They inspire me.

826
00:50:53.208 --> 00:50:56.500
Yeah. every time I see

827
00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.792
something amazing
he's written...

828
00:51:02.042 --> 00:51:07.542
A plot point. a twist.
character arc note...

829
00:51:08.042 --> 00:51:09.833
I make note of it.

830
00:51:13.208 --> 00:51:15.583
I suppose it's a little weird.

831
00:51:15.583 --> 00:51:17.417
- No. No. it's not.

832
00:51:20.375 --> 00:51:23.292
- Not everyone has
the raw talent you have.

833
00:51:24.833 --> 00:51:29.417
Others have to work and study
to write as good as he does.

834
00:51:30.208 --> 00:51:33.500
- Oh. no.
I'm nothing like him.

835
00:51:35.083 --> 00:51:36.833
- He thinks you are.

836
00:51:37.708 --> 00:51:39.208
So does Professor Dorr.

837
00:51:41.375 --> 00:51:43.292
Story of my life. Ashley.

838
00:51:45.875 --> 00:51:48.083
Everybody underestimates me.

839
00:51:50.875 --> 00:51:52.875
Underestimates
what I'm capable of.

840
00:51:58.333 --> 00:52:00.458
- Well. not Miles Blake.

841
00:52:01.292 --> 00:52:02.875
- What do you mean?

842
00:52:02.875 --> 00:52:05.875
- Yours was the only one
that he said had potential.

843
00:52:07.792 --> 00:52:10.708
- He said that?
- Yeah!

844
00:52:10.708 --> 00:52:13.208
So. I think if he's ever short
with you or anything.

845
00:52:13.208 --> 00:52:16.083
he's just trying
to push you harder.

846
00:52:16.083 --> 00:52:18.583
So. I wouldn't worry
about it too much.

847
00:52:18.583 --> 00:52:20.250
He's a fan.

848
00:52:21.792 --> 00:52:22.917
- A fan.

849
00:52:24.833 --> 00:52:25.792
- Yeah.

850
00:52:28.958 --> 00:52:31.958
- I was thinking about maybe
seeing him tomorrow.

851
00:52:31.958 --> 00:52:33.625
About my paper.

852
00:52:34.958 --> 00:52:36.708
A new book idea.

853
00:52:36.708 --> 00:52:39.625
- No. you should.
Yeah. go for it!

854
00:52:41.167 --> 00:52:43.375
Writing notes on the margins
of his books.

855
00:52:43.375 --> 00:52:45.042
I'm gonna remember that.

856
00:52:45.042 --> 00:52:46.542
Smart thinking.

857
00:52:47.375 --> 00:52:49.375
- Why did you really come here?

858
00:52:51.333 --> 00:52:54.583
- Like I said. uh. Miles Blake
was asking about you.

859
00:52:56.083 --> 00:52:58.250
Oh. by the way um...

860
00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:00.292
class doesn't pick up
'til next week.

861
00:53:01.708 --> 00:53:04.708
Thought I'd let you know.
Save you the walk.

862
00:53:04.708 --> 00:53:05.833
- Why?

863
00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:10.792
- Didn't you hear the news
about the missing student?

864
00:53:13.917 --> 00:53:16.500
- Kate Bishop?
- Yeah.

865
00:53:17.875 --> 00:53:18.792
- No.

866
00:53:20.375 --> 00:53:23.875
I was either sleeping
or reading in the hospital.

867
00:53:25.375 --> 00:53:26.667
Did they find her?

868
00:53:27.917 --> 00:53:31.375
- Yeah. Um... her body washed up

869
00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:33.583
on the campus shores
of the lake.

870
00:53:34.417 --> 00:53:36.417
They think she may have drowned.

871
00:53:39.083 --> 00:53:40.333
- Drowned.

872
00:53:44.125 --> 00:53:45.625
That's too bad.

873
00:53:51.292 --> 00:53:53.792
Did you read my assignment?
- No.

874
00:53:53.792 --> 00:53:56.583
We split up the pile.
I didn't get a chance to.

875
00:53:57.708 --> 00:53:59.625
- Did he tell you
what it was about?

876
00:54:00.542 --> 00:54:04.750
- No. Murder. I'm assuming.

877
00:54:08.667 --> 00:54:12.125
- I was thinking
about what he said in class.

878
00:54:12.125 --> 00:54:13.708
about research.

879
00:54:14.292 --> 00:54:16.125
- Research?

880
00:54:16.125 --> 00:54:19.500
- You know. in a perfect world.

881
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:23.625
the only way to offer
true authenticity

882
00:54:23.625 --> 00:54:26.375
would be to commit
a murder yourself.

883
00:54:27.208 --> 00:54:29.417
- He was joking. though.

884
00:54:29.417 --> 00:54:31.292
You know that. right?

885
00:54:31.292 --> 00:54:32.750
- But imagine...

886
00:54:34.458 --> 00:54:36.375
...if someone actually did that?

887
00:54:38.333 --> 00:54:39.917
Where they took it that far...

888
00:54:45.583 --> 00:54:48.667
- Um... Well. I hope
you feel better.

889
00:54:48.667 --> 00:54:51.042
I'll see you in class
next week.

890
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.375
(phone beeping)

891
00:55:14.375 --> 00:55:16.625
(Miles on phone):
In an ideal world.

892
00:55:16.625 --> 00:55:19.583
we'd just commit
the murder ourselves. right?

893
00:55:19.583 --> 00:55:22.750
That's the only way to offer
the reader true authenticity.

894
00:55:23.792 --> 00:55:29.625
- It is such a shame seeing
someone pass away so young.

895
00:55:29.625 --> 00:55:31.375
- Did you have her
in any classes?

896
00:55:31.375 --> 00:55:36.458
- Yeah. I did.
She is... was. very smart.

897
00:55:36.458 --> 00:55:38.625
Very determined.

898
00:55:38.625 --> 00:55:42.542
You know. she reminded me
of a certain other student

899
00:55:42.542 --> 00:55:44.750
that has been in my life
for the past few years.

900
00:55:45.833 --> 00:55:48.875
Ashley. what is it?

901
00:55:48.875 --> 00:55:50.583
- It's nothing.

902
00:55:53.542 --> 00:55:56.458
You know how you told us to
trust our guts. our instincts?

903
00:55:56.458 --> 00:55:58.208
- Yes. of course.

904
00:55:58.208 --> 00:55:59.875
Why do you ask?

905
00:56:04.208 --> 00:56:06.500
- Detectives.
Time to learn.

906
00:56:08.958 --> 00:56:10.708
- What is it?

907
00:56:11.542 --> 00:56:13.833
- Well. aside from
the tinting of the skin

908
00:56:13.833 --> 00:56:17.667
and the shrunken eyes.
her organs in the area
of the galea over here.

909
00:56:17.667 --> 00:56:20.208
are showing extreme signs
of dehydration.

910
00:56:20.208 --> 00:56:22.625
- Dehydration? She drowned.

911
00:56:26.417 --> 00:56:31.125
- What he said.
and how he said it...

912
00:56:31.125 --> 00:56:33.542
about taking that far.

913
00:56:33.542 --> 00:56:37.042
- Ashley. David is
a unique individual.

914
00:56:37.042 --> 00:56:39.667
I'll give you that.
but he is no killer.

915
00:56:39.667 --> 00:56:42.208
- Haven't we heard that
before in our society?

916
00:56:42.208 --> 00:56:45.917
Right before bodies are found
in our neighbor's basement.

917
00:56:47.125 --> 00:56:49.458
I'm... I'm so sorry.

918
00:56:49.458 --> 00:56:51.208
I... don't know why I said that.

919
00:56:51.208 --> 00:56:54.333
- Have you heard
of Occam's razor?

920
00:56:54.958 --> 00:56:57.708
- Sure. the most simple
explanation...

921
00:56:57.708 --> 00:56:59.333
- Is the most likely answer.

922
00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:03.292
Getting rid of all the
unnecessary information.

923
00:57:03.292 --> 00:57:08.000
speculation. out of the way.
is the fastest way to the truth.

924
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.208
Now. tell me.
what makes more sense.

925
00:57:11.208 --> 00:57:13.792
that David is a skilled murderer

926
00:57:13.792 --> 00:57:17.083
who is able and ready
to hide in plain sight.

927
00:57:17.083 --> 00:57:20.958
or that the girl drowned
in a terrible accident?

928
00:57:32.875 --> 00:57:34.458
- I'm a writer.

929
00:57:35.042 --> 00:57:37.708
I should be able to find
the words for how sorry I am

930
00:57:37.708 --> 00:57:39.542
for the way that I acted.

931
00:57:40.458 --> 00:57:42.042
- It's okay.

932
00:57:42.042 --> 00:57:44.667
Everyone handles
these things differently.

933
00:57:45.458 --> 00:57:47.000
- I was out of line.

934
00:57:48.917 --> 00:57:51.625
- Well. so was I.

935
00:57:51.625 --> 00:57:55.000
- You know.
I had a brother growing up.

936
00:57:58.583 --> 00:58:00.792
He was a few years older
than me. and he drowned

937
00:58:00.792 --> 00:58:02.958
in a river after a night
of drinking.

938
00:58:04.708 --> 00:58:07.750
They didn't find his body
for a few days.

939
00:58:09.125 --> 00:58:12.500
- I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

940
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.167
- No. how could you.

941
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:17.958
He's not in my bio. I don't talk
about him in interviews.

942
00:58:17.958 --> 00:58:20.375
Grief kinda turned him
into a family secret.

943
00:58:21.083 --> 00:58:24.042
Doesn't give me the permission
to use it against anybody.

944
00:58:24.042 --> 00:58:25.208
especially you.

945
00:58:27.583 --> 00:58:30.542
Anyway. back to writing.

946
00:58:30.542 --> 00:58:33.667
I'll see you in class next week?
- Of course.

947
00:58:33.667 --> 00:58:36.167
Oh. and Miles?
- Yes. Ashley.

948
00:58:36.708 --> 00:58:39.250
- Has the book told you
what it's about yet?

949
00:58:41.125 --> 00:58:44.458
It's about the limits
of human beings.

950
00:58:44.458 --> 00:58:47.125
What happens when we push
ourselves too far.

951
00:58:47.875 --> 00:58:49.458
- That's all
you're gonna give me?

952
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.833
- About a brilliant detective

953
00:58:51.833 --> 00:58:53.542
who's trying to catch
her murderer.

954
00:58:53.542 --> 00:58:56.750
only to fall for the very traps
she knows to avoid.

955
00:58:58.875 --> 00:59:00.208
- Not bad.

956
00:59:01.125 --> 00:59:02.542
- It's a start!

957
00:59:12.417 --> 00:59:14.750
(knocking on door)
- Come on. girl!

958
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:16.958
It's time for that morning fuel!

959
00:59:20.875 --> 00:59:24.542
Hey! D'you go for coffee
without me?

960
00:59:25.208 --> 00:59:27.208
Are you okay?

961
00:59:27.208 --> 00:59:29.458
- First autopsy last night.

962
00:59:29.458 --> 00:59:31.000
- That bad?

963
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.833
- Normally. it probably
wouldn't have been.

964
00:59:32.833 --> 00:59:36.542
but it was... it was her.

965
00:59:36.542 --> 00:59:38.917
Kate Bishop.
- Oh. my God. Jordan.

966
00:59:39.458 --> 00:59:41.833
- Detectives finally came in.

967
00:59:41.833 --> 00:59:44.792
I was hoping they would've done
it sooner. when I wasn't there.

968
00:59:44.792 --> 00:59:47.875
I mean. I need
the experience. but...

969
00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:49.917
- But like. are you okay?

970
00:59:50.875 --> 00:59:52.833
(sighing)
- I will be.

971
00:59:52.833 --> 00:59:54.833
Just need some rest.

972
00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:58.083
- What was it like?

973
00:59:58.958 --> 01:00:00.167
- Not good.

974
01:00:00.833 --> 01:00:02.875
I guess I can tell you
the basics.

975
01:00:02.875 --> 01:00:04.833
But there are details
you need to promise me

976
01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:07.458
you won't share until
they're public... with anyone.

977
01:00:07.458 --> 01:00:09.083
- Yeah. of course.

978
01:00:10.167 --> 01:00:11.333
- She drowned.

979
01:00:12.708 --> 01:00:15.833
But they found
some strange elements.

980
01:00:16.667 --> 01:00:18.958
First off. she was
severely dehydrated.

981
01:00:18.958 --> 01:00:21.042
- Can you be dehydrated
after drowning?

982
01:00:21.042 --> 01:00:25.833
- Yeah. of course.
But... what they saw...

983
01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:30.292
it was consistent
with someone that would've
died of dehydration

984
01:00:30.292 --> 01:00:31.958
over the course of a few days.

985
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:36.375
And from what they heard
from witnesses.

986
01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:37.833
the night she was last seen.

987
01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:39.750
she wasn't even
drinking alcohol.

988
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:42.042
so how was she dehydrated
the same night

989
01:00:42.042 --> 01:00:44.333
she was throwing back
lemon ice waters?

990
01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:48.208
And that's not even the weirdest
part about the autopsy.

991
01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:50.750
The water in her lungs...

992
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:54.333
...it wasn't from the lake.

993
01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:57.250
- But that doesn't make
any sense.

994
01:00:58.333 --> 01:01:02.333
- She drowned long before being
put in those lake waters.

995
01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:09.167
Look. I'm like
the walking dead here.

996
01:01:09.167 --> 01:01:10.875
(chuckling)

997
01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:13.917
How about after I get
some sleep.

998
01:01:13.917 --> 01:01:16.292
dinner and a friendly face?

999
01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:19.500
Ashley?

1000
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.667
- Oh. um. sorry.

1001
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:26.042
Can we raincheck?
Tomorrow. for sure.

1002
01:01:26.042 --> 01:01:28.875
I just... I'm so close to
nailing that final act and ...

1003
01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:30.792
- I see those gears turning.
(chuckling)

1004
01:01:30.792 --> 01:01:32.792
Raincheck for sure.

1005
01:01:32.792 --> 01:01:34.417
Good night.

1006
01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:36.667
Or good morning. I guess.

1007
01:01:38.042 --> 01:01:39.875
- Get some rest.

1008
01:01:39.875 --> 01:01:41.958
And hey. everything's
gonna be okay.

1009
01:01:48.042 --> 01:01:52.708
- Hey. You think I'm still cut
out for this detective stuff?

1010
01:01:54.292 --> 01:01:57.625
- Take a look on that wall
of adventures of yours.

1011
01:01:57.625 --> 01:02:00.125
You're capable
of anything. Jordan.

1012
01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:01.708
Love you.

1013
01:02:01.708 --> 01:02:03.917
- Love you back.

1014
01:02:13.708 --> 01:02:15.250
(knocking on door)

1015
01:02:21.542 --> 01:02:22.833
- David.

1016
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:27.042
David uh... Freeman. right?

1017
01:02:27.042 --> 01:02:28.542
- Yes.

1018
01:02:28.542 --> 01:02:31.125
Um. Mr. Blake--
- No. no. Miles.

1019
01:02:31.917 --> 01:02:34.708
(chuckling)
- Miles. I um...

1020
01:02:34.708 --> 01:02:36.167
- I haven't seen you class
this last week.

1021
01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:39.042
- That's partly why I'm here.

1022
01:02:39.042 --> 01:02:40.583
I wanted to apologize.

1023
01:02:40.583 --> 01:02:41.875
I was actually
in the hospital.

1024
01:02:41.875 --> 01:02:44.083
- Oh no. Everything okay?

1025
01:02:44.625 --> 01:02:46.583
- I am. I am now.

1026
01:02:46.583 --> 01:02:48.208
- Great.

1027
01:02:48.208 --> 01:02:50.583
No apology necessary.
What was the other thing?

1028
01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:55.333
- I um... I wanted to talk
to you about my paper.

1029
01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:58.250
If you have time.
If you don't. it can wait.

1030
01:03:00.208 --> 01:03:02.792
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
come to your house.

1031
01:03:02.792 --> 01:03:04.833
I overstepped.
- No. no. it's uh...

1032
01:03:06.792 --> 01:03:09.250
That's all right.
Um. would love to talk about it.

1033
01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.250
Come on in.

1034
01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:24.208
Yeah. come here.

1035
01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:25.333
Your paper...

1036
01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:28.042
- Did... did you like it?

1037
01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:29.917
- You like scotch. David?

1038
01:03:31.042 --> 01:03:34.333
- Um... My father used
to drink it.

1039
01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:36.500
I had some once
when I was a kid.

1040
01:03:37.542 --> 01:03:43.958
- So. your paper...
was really well thought out.

1041
01:03:44.875 --> 01:03:46.208
Inventive.

1042
01:03:46.208 --> 01:03:47.667
Please.

1043
01:03:47.667 --> 01:03:49.542
(sighing)

1044
01:03:49.542 --> 01:03:53.042
To writers. may we escape
our inevitable defeat

1045
01:03:53.042 --> 01:03:58.167
with grace and humility.
before our inevitable... demise.

1046
01:04:03.583 --> 01:04:05.292
- That's from your fourth book.

1047
01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:07.667
- I'm impressed.

1048
01:04:07.667 --> 01:04:09.542
- I study them all.

1049
01:04:09.542 --> 01:04:11.583
- For the writing. I hope.

1050
01:04:13.292 --> 01:04:14.250
- Mm-hmm.

1051
01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:17.375
Look. uh. Mr. Blake--
- Mm-mm-mm-mm.

1052
01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:18.625
- Uh. Miles...

1053
01:04:19.875 --> 01:04:22.000
Um. I wanted to...

1054
01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:26.500
I wanted to talk to you
about my paper. yes.

1055
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:30.167
but uh. specifically
about the content.

1056
01:04:30.958 --> 01:04:35.667
- Did seem somewhat.
uh... familiar.

1057
01:04:36.542 --> 01:04:40.250
- That's... that's what
I wanted to talk about.

1058
01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:43.917
- Yeah.

1059
01:04:43.917 --> 01:04:47.792
"Her body was found
in the cold lake waters.

1060
01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:50.542
washed up in the debris
of a fallen tree.

1061
01:04:50.542 --> 01:04:53.000
Lifeless. wet.

1062
01:04:53.708 --> 01:04:55.500
Waiting to be discovered."

1063
01:04:57.958 --> 01:05:00.333
- I had nothing to do
with her death.

1064
01:05:01.042 --> 01:05:03.875
I was sick. and then.
in the hospital.

1065
01:05:03.875 --> 01:05:05.250
You can check the records.

1066
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.208
I'll give them permission
to release them to you.

1067
01:05:07.208 --> 01:05:10.500
And when I got and I heard
what happened. I swear. I--

1068
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.042
- David...

1069
01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:15.417
If there's one thing
I've learned in all my years.

1070
01:05:15.417 --> 01:05:17.833
it's that coincidences
are just a curious part

1071
01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:19.917
of the reality
of the universe we live in.

1072
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.042
They happen. okay?

1073
01:05:23.042 --> 01:05:25.958
I felt the exact same way
that you feel right now

1074
01:05:25.958 --> 01:05:28.958
when I've read new stories
that had similar details

1075
01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:31.042
to my own conjured methods.

1076
01:05:31.042 --> 01:05:33.375
Methods of my characters.
mind you. okay.

1077
01:05:33.375 --> 01:05:35.542
(sighing)

1078
01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:38.208
I won't say a word to anyone.

1079
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.042
You don't strike me
as the killing type.

1080
01:05:42.583 --> 01:05:43.917
Okay?

1081
01:05:46.083 --> 01:05:49.542
Now. what I did find intriguing

1082
01:05:49.542 --> 01:05:52.208
was the methodology
that you used for your killer.

1083
01:05:53.667 --> 01:05:57.125
It was... inventive.

1084
01:06:01.292 --> 01:06:04.167
- I wasn't sure if it was
too unbelievable.

1085
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:07.792
- "They would never know.

1086
01:06:07.792 --> 01:06:10.667
their unskilled minds to the
ways of a killer mastermind."

1087
01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:12.875
That's a little heavy-handed.
I'm gonna let it slide.

1088
01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:15.208
"That the girl. the victim.

1089
01:06:15.208 --> 01:06:17.292
never stepped foot in a lake

1090
01:06:17.292 --> 01:06:20.292
when she was among the living.
that she. in fact.

1091
01:06:20.292 --> 01:06:22.750
drowned 50 miles away in a tub.

1092
01:06:23.958 --> 01:06:28.083
Lungs full of fresh.
suburban waters."

1093
01:06:30.083 --> 01:06:34.083
Macabre. indeed.
but you've got some talent.

1094
01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:37.375
A good eye for
a compelling hook.

1095
01:06:41.292 --> 01:06:43.542
Let's have another drink before
I have to go back to writing.

1096
01:06:43.542 --> 01:06:44.583
Thanks.

1097
01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.375
- Um...

1098
01:06:49.042 --> 01:06:50.875
I'm actually starting
a new book.

1099
01:06:50.875 --> 01:06:52.333
- Oh. good for you!

1100
01:06:53.083 --> 01:06:55.000
Care to tell me what it's about?

1101
01:06:55.708 --> 01:06:57.333
Promise I won't steal it.

1102
01:07:06.167 --> 01:07:09.625
- It's actually inspired by
something you said in class.

1103
01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.750
About research.

1104
01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:16.625
And how the only way to offer
true authenticity

1105
01:07:16.625 --> 01:07:19.042
when it comes to seeing the
world through a killer's eyes

1106
01:07:19.042 --> 01:07:22.042
is to--
- Commit the murder yourself.

1107
01:07:23.792 --> 01:07:26.083
You know I was joking. right?

1108
01:07:27.083 --> 01:07:28.792
Just trying to prove a point?

1109
01:07:33.125 --> 01:07:36.208
- But what if--
- Oh yeah. the greatest

1110
01:07:36.208 --> 01:07:38.042
and most dangerous
question of all.

1111
01:07:41.125 --> 01:07:42.792
What if.

1112
01:07:53.125 --> 01:07:55.250
(upbeat music)

1113
01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:08.292
Hello there.
(chuckling)

1114
01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:11.542
- Hi.

1115
01:08:11.542 --> 01:08:13.583
It's--
- Jordan.

1116
01:08:13.583 --> 01:08:17.333
Yeah. no. I never forget
a pretty face.

1117
01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:20.417
Or the name that goes
along with it.

1118
01:08:20.417 --> 01:08:23.292
(chuckling)
Let me guess. girls' night out?

1119
01:08:23.292 --> 01:08:25.083
Is Ashley coming
to meet you here?

1120
01:08:25.083 --> 01:08:26.500
- No.

1121
01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.708
I'm actually
flying solo tonight.

1122
01:08:28.708 --> 01:08:30.125
No wing woman.

1123
01:08:30.125 --> 01:08:31.917
She's writing.

1124
01:08:31.917 --> 01:08:34.583
- Oh. well done. Ashley.

1125
01:08:34.583 --> 01:08:36.167
Well done.

1126
01:08:37.167 --> 01:08:39.375
Please. sit. Join me.

1127
01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:41.250
Nobody should drink alone.

1128
01:08:42.667 --> 01:08:43.792
- Not even you.

1129
01:08:44.833 --> 01:08:46.667
(chuckling)

1130
01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:50.333
- So...

1131
01:08:52.667 --> 01:08:54.208
What are we drinking?

1132
01:09:17.708 --> 01:09:18.792
Thanks.

1133
01:09:21.167 --> 01:09:22.667
Keep the change.

1134
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:35.792
To... newfound friends.

1135
01:09:35.792 --> 01:09:37.750
- Hmm. Hmm.

1136
01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:40.583
And maybe something more?

1137
01:09:42.542 --> 01:09:45.375
- I'm actually afraid
this is my last call.

1138
01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:48.375
- Oh. That's what I always say.

1139
01:09:48.375 --> 01:09:50.792
And then. many rounds later...

1140
01:09:51.875 --> 01:09:55.708
- Would it be too forward to ask
you to go on a walk with me?

1141
01:09:56.958 --> 01:10:00.792
It can be strictly professional
if you'd prefer.

1142
01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:05.625
- I'm not Ashley. Miles.

1143
01:10:05.625 --> 01:10:09.667
We don't need to... talk shop
to enjoy a walk together.

1144
01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:13.625
- Just let me freshen up a bit?

1145
01:10:14.667 --> 01:10:18.083
- Tell you what. I'm gonna
close out the bar tab

1146
01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:20.417
and I will meet you outside.

1147
01:10:22.708 --> 01:10:23.667
- Hmm.

1148
01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:40.167
- Sorry. Sorry.

1149
01:10:40.167 --> 01:10:42.917
- Leave it. man.
Happens all the time.

1150
01:10:57.583 --> 01:10:59.708
- It's beautiful out. isn't it?

1151
01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:03.375
- Quite beautiful. yes.

1152
01:11:05.542 --> 01:11:09.000
It's hard to imagine a life
was lost in those waters.

1153
01:11:10.208 --> 01:11:11.708
- I know.

1154
01:11:11.708 --> 01:11:13.375
It's sad.

1155
01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:17.042
- I hear you're quite
the swimmer. though.

1156
01:11:17.042 --> 01:11:19.375
- Been competing my whole life.

1157
01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:22.875
I'm starting to train
for another Ironman.

1158
01:11:24.042 --> 01:11:25.417
- Interesting.

1159
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.458
(sighing)
Wonder what it feels like.

1160
01:11:32.333 --> 01:11:33.667
- What...

1161
01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:36.875
What do you mean?

1162
01:11:39.542 --> 01:11:41.292
- When you're about to die.

1163
01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:44.625
- What did you say?

1164
01:11:48.708 --> 01:11:50.375
You?

1165
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.417
- Think it through.

1166
01:11:53.708 --> 01:11:56.083
Back corner table at the bar.

1167
01:11:57.208 --> 01:11:58.917
Away from most people's view.

1168
01:11:59.667 --> 01:12:01.958
Had to make sure
people saw me leave alone.

1169
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:06.000
You as well.

1170
01:12:08.875 --> 01:12:11.333
Now piece it together.
You wanna be a detective. right?

1171
01:12:11.333 --> 01:12:13.708
So. what's missing?

1172
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.708
- The drinks.

1173
01:12:19.708 --> 01:12:21.958
- Recipe I've perfected
throughout the years.

1174
01:12:23.417 --> 01:12:25.042
To a tee.

1175
01:12:25.583 --> 01:12:28.833
Quick estimation of body weight
to tolerance.

1176
01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:32.583
steady stride to make sure the
blood stream carries the drug.

1177
01:12:33.417 --> 01:12:35.042
All timed to perfection.

1178
01:12:35.042 --> 01:12:41.333
I mean. I don't wanna brag.
but... it works quite well.

1179
01:12:42.417 --> 01:12:44.958
- I don't... I don't...

1180
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.042
- Hey.
- I don't wanna die.

1181
01:12:48.042 --> 01:12:49.500
- Nobody wants to die.

1182
01:12:51.875 --> 01:12:54.042
(sirens blaring)

1183
01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:01.458
(car door closing)

1184
01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:07.917
(engine starting)

1185
01:14:25.458 --> 01:14:27.000
- Come on!

1186
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.167
(sighing)

1187
01:14:29.167 --> 01:14:31.875
(Jordan's voicemail): Hey.
it's Jordan. you know the drill.

1188
01:14:31.875 --> 01:14:33.958
I'll get back to you. ASAP.

1189
01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:37.250
- Hey. it's me again.

1190
01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:38.708
We haven't gone a couple days

1191
01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:41.667
without talking
since. well. ever.

1192
01:14:41.667 --> 01:14:43.667
I hope you're not ghosting me.

1193
01:14:48.542 --> 01:14:50.000
Where are you?

1194
01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:02.125
- It was a valiant effort.

1195
01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:05.792
It's exactly
what I was hoping for but...

1196
01:15:05.792 --> 01:15:09.875
I'm afraid you ran out of time
and it's... it's such a shame.

1197
01:15:09.875 --> 01:15:13.833
It would've made for a much more
exciting ending.

1198
01:15:14.792 --> 01:15:16.583
- I know who you are.

1199
01:15:17.375 --> 01:15:19.500
You don't need the mask.

1200
01:15:20.333 --> 01:15:22.625
- We all need masks.

1201
01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:26.167
- Is that how you get
through this?

1202
01:15:26.167 --> 01:15:27.958
You hide behind it?

1203
01:15:27.958 --> 01:15:30.667
You think you're someone else
when you do these sick things?

1204
01:15:31.542 --> 01:15:34.042
And then. when it's over.

1205
01:15:34.042 --> 01:15:38.042
you take it off and you feel
good about yourself.

1206
01:15:39.417 --> 01:15:41.125
Like someone else is doing it.

1207
01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:45.042
- That's an excellent profile.

1208
01:15:45.042 --> 01:15:47.750
You would've made
a great detective.

1209
01:15:48.708 --> 01:15:51.000
- You don't have to do this.

1210
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.583
(sighing)

1211
01:15:52.583 --> 01:15:54.292
- That's what they all say.

1212
01:15:55.458 --> 01:15:57.125
But I do.

1213
01:15:57.125 --> 01:15:59.042
It's the only way.

1214
01:15:59.042 --> 01:16:01.208
- Only way to what?

1215
01:16:03.042 --> 01:16:06.083
- The only way I know
how to write death so well.

1216
01:16:07.708 --> 01:16:09.292
Can I offer you some water?

1217
01:16:09.292 --> 01:16:10.875
(chuckling)

1218
01:16:10.875 --> 01:16:12.083
- I remember what happened

1219
01:16:12.083 --> 01:16:14.542
the last time I accepted
a drink from you.

1220
01:16:14.542 --> 01:16:19.250
- Oh. I assure you.
this water is quite pure.

1221
01:16:35.667 --> 01:16:37.000
- Jordan?

1222
01:16:42.583 --> 01:16:44.292
- She's not home.

1223
01:16:44.292 --> 01:16:45.875
- Are you sure?

1224
01:16:45.875 --> 01:16:47.625
- Figured she left town
for the weekend.

1225
01:16:47.625 --> 01:16:49.375
Haven't seen her since Friday.

1226
01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:51.208
- Friday. That's the last time
I talked to her.

1227
01:16:51.208 --> 01:16:52.750
Uh. where was she?

1228
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.917
- I saw her at Main Street Pub.

1229
01:16:54.917 --> 01:16:57.875
- Alone?
- I think so. yeah.

1230
01:16:59.708 --> 01:17:02.125
(ominous music)

1231
01:17:06.625 --> 01:17:09.833
- You're sure?
- Yeah uh. she and the guy

1232
01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:13.375
sat in the back corner.
had a few drinks together.

1233
01:17:13.375 --> 01:17:14.625
He was a little older.

1234
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.042
- Was this him?

1235
01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:24.542
- Yeah. That's him.

1236
01:17:24.542 --> 01:17:26.958
Wow. is he uh...
- Did they leave together?

1237
01:17:26.958 --> 01:17:28.958
- Uh. no.

1238
01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:31.208
She was in the bathroom.
I think.

1239
01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:33.125
No. he dropped a glass.
looked a little upset.

1240
01:17:33.125 --> 01:17:35.208
You know. I figured it didn't
work out with them.

1241
01:17:35.208 --> 01:17:37.708
Um... she left soon after.

1242
01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:39.542
- And that was Friday?

1243
01:17:39.542 --> 01:17:41.917
- Couple days ago. yeah.

1244
01:17:45.083 --> 01:17:47.083
- Could you... could you
turn that up?

1245
01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:49.000
- And the death
of a university student.

1246
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.250
Another student. David Freeman.

1247
01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:55.375
was found dead in his apartment.
of an apparent suicide.

1248
01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:57.958
On his body was a suicide note

1249
01:17:57.958 --> 01:18:01.333
confessing to the murder
of student Kate Bishop.

1250
01:18:01.333 --> 01:18:05.250
originally thought to have
drowned in the campus lake.

1251
01:18:05.250 --> 01:18:07.542
The more intriguing part
of this story

1252
01:18:07.542 --> 01:18:11.875
is that the note referred to
women. plural. that he killed.

1253
01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:14.000
Authorities hope that
this is just a result

1254
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.125
of a misspelling on the note.

1255
01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:20.333
but are likely to be sending out
divers to the lake once again.

1256
01:18:22.083 --> 01:18:24.833
- I was thinking about maybe
seeing him tomorrow.

1257
01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:29.125
About my paper and...
a new book idea.

1258
01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:31.208
- It was consistent with someone
that would've died

1259
01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:33.167
of dehydration over the course
of a few days.

1260
01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:37.833
The water in her lungs.
it wasn't from the lake.

1261
01:18:37.833 --> 01:18:39.417
- That doesn't make any sense.

1262
01:18:39.417 --> 01:18:43.583
- She drowned long before
being put in those lake waters.

1263
01:18:43.583 --> 01:18:45.125
- Jordan...

1264
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.833
- Help!

1265
01:19:01.458 --> 01:19:03.083
(breathing shakily)

1266
01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:33.000
- Miles?

1267
01:19:34.542 --> 01:19:36.167
(door creaking)

1268
01:19:39.792 --> 01:19:42.083
(suspenseful music)

1269
01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.417
Hello?

1270
01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:50.917
Miles?

1271
01:19:52.708 --> 01:19:55.333
- Please!

1272
01:19:55.333 --> 01:19:57.875
Help!

1273
01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:10.208
- It's Ashley.
Are you in here?

1274
01:20:28.708 --> 01:20:31.083
(breathing shakily)

1275
01:21:19.667 --> 01:21:22.542
(eerie music)

1276
01:21:28.708 --> 01:21:30.333
- Help.

1277
01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.167
Help!

1278
01:21:34.167 --> 01:21:35.875
Please!

1279
01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:40.500
- Jordan? Jordan!

1280
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.542
- Ashley!

1281
01:21:42.458 --> 01:21:45.333
Ashley! Turn off the water.
throw the hose down.

1282
01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:46.375
- Okay!

1283
01:21:47.042 --> 01:21:48.500
- Turn off the hose.

1284
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:51.167
Throw it down!
Throw it down!

1285
01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:53.417
It's not safe.
you gotta get outta here.

1286
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:56.625
(grunting)

1287
01:21:59.792 --> 01:22:01.917
(grunting)

1288
01:22:04.792 --> 01:22:06.458
(grunting)

1289
01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.667
(screaming)

1290
01:22:11.667 --> 01:22:12.583
(grunting)

1291
01:22:12.583 --> 01:22:14.583
(coughing)

1292
01:22:21.875 --> 01:22:24.208
(panting. grunting)

1293
01:22:24.208 --> 01:22:27.042
(breathing heavily)

1294
01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:28.458
- She was strong.

1295
01:22:30.167 --> 01:22:32.875
Stronger than the others.
just as I hoped.

1296
01:22:32.875 --> 01:22:34.958
- How could you?

1297
01:22:35.708 --> 01:22:38.625
- I'm not a killer. Ashley.
I don't do this for fun.

1298
01:22:40.708 --> 01:22:42.625
I do this because I have to.

1299
01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:46.583
At first. I was just gonna
follow 'em.

1300
01:22:46.583 --> 01:22:51.583
I mean. just to see.
feel what it was like.

1301
01:22:51.583 --> 01:22:54.250
But then...
(chuckling)

1302
01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:56.833
...I couldn't stop.
(chuckling)

1303
01:22:56.833 --> 01:23:00.125
I mean. with every new method
or murder that I conjured up.

1304
01:23:00.125 --> 01:23:02.375
I had to know...

1305
01:23:02.375 --> 01:23:05.167
I had to know what it felt like.

1306
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.375
I mean. you've read my books.
that's why everybody loves 'em.

1307
01:23:10.542 --> 01:23:14.583
That's the draw
they want to know!

1308
01:23:15.375 --> 01:23:17.000
- Why Jordan?

1309
01:23:19.375 --> 01:23:20.750
(grunting)

1310
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:22.667
- The story.

1311
01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:26.500
It's always been
about the story.

1312
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:30.917
I mean. I wanted to explore how
two very different characters

1313
01:23:30.917 --> 01:23:32.500
could get killed
in the same way.

1314
01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.708
I mean. Kate. she was weak.
She couldn't even swim.

1315
01:23:35.708 --> 01:23:37.250
But...

1316
01:23:38.042 --> 01:23:39.875
Hmm. Jordan...

1317
01:23:39.875 --> 01:23:41.292
(chuckling)

1318
01:23:43.042 --> 01:23:44.875
She was strong.

1319
01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:48.417
She almost made it!

1320
01:23:48.417 --> 01:23:49.667
Almost!

1321
01:23:50.667 --> 01:23:52.917
(grunting)

1322
01:23:52.917 --> 01:23:54.750
(breathing heavily)

1323
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:56.708
I mean. that's the story.

1324
01:23:58.375 --> 01:24:02.708
A detective who's searching
for a killer.

1325
01:24:02.708 --> 01:24:06.292
who drowned his victims
in a particular way.

1326
01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:10.125
And then. he got caught
in that same trap.

1327
01:24:10.125 --> 01:24:12.917
How would he fare? I mean.
the fact that Jordan

1328
01:24:12.917 --> 01:24:15.458
was studying to be
a detective...

1329
01:24:15.458 --> 01:24:17.167
(gasping)

1330
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.458
That just felt right.

1331
01:24:20.375 --> 01:24:22.542
(breathing shakily)
- You're sick.

1332
01:24:22.542 --> 01:24:24.417
- Yeah. I admit it.

1333
01:24:25.375 --> 01:24:29.042
After my last novel. I got
a little writer's block.

1334
01:24:29.042 --> 01:24:30.542
- The assignment?

1335
01:24:31.292 --> 01:24:36.375
- It's like Picasso said.
"Good artists copy.

1336
01:24:36.375 --> 01:24:38.833
Great artists steal."

1337
01:24:39.417 --> 01:24:41.583
(grunting. breathing heavily)

1338
01:24:42.875 --> 01:24:44.792
- David's paper. Why David?

1339
01:24:46.125 --> 01:24:48.333
- Somebody had to take the fall.

1340
01:24:49.708 --> 01:24:51.542
He was the perfect cover.

1341
01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:55.500
- You didn't even have
a brother. did you?

1342
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:56.750
(groaning)

1343
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:58.875
- You haven't been paying
attention in class.

1344
01:24:58.875 --> 01:25:02.208
It was a necessary misdirect.

1345
01:25:02.208 --> 01:25:05.292
meant to entice some empathy!

1346
01:25:05.292 --> 01:25:08.417
That's what I taught you.
and it worked.

1347
01:25:10.542 --> 01:25:11.958
Huh?!

1348
01:25:11.958 --> 01:25:13.917
(breathing shakily)

1349
01:25:13.917 --> 01:25:15.833
- But what about me?

1350
01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:17.500
(sighing)

1351
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.833
- Every great story has a twist.

1352
01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.125
I'm sorry.

1353
01:25:24.125 --> 01:25:25.625
(suspenseful music)

1354
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.167
- Ashley!

1355
01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:31.375
(exclaiming)
(head banging)

1356
01:25:35.958 --> 01:25:37.667
(crying)

1357
01:25:37.667 --> 01:25:39.667
(grunting)

1358
01:25:40.708 --> 01:25:42.542
(breathing heavily)

1359
01:25:53.250 --> 01:25:56.458
- "And as she finally climbed
over the edge. drenched.

1360
01:25:56.458 --> 01:25:59.208
but free from her dark.
dire prison.

1361
01:25:59.208 --> 01:26:01.208
she lifted her eyes
to the sky.

1362
01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:03.667
empowered by the triumphant
realization.

1363
01:26:03.667 --> 01:26:07.000
His submergence
was her emergence."

1364
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.833
(applause)

1365
01:26:10.625 --> 01:26:13.542
- Ashley. I'm going to bring
this amazing reading to a close

1366
01:26:13.542 --> 01:26:16.875
with a question
that I think everyone
in this room is wondering.

1367
01:26:16.875 --> 01:26:20.500
You've topped the fiction
charts for months. What's next?

1368
01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:25.708
- I think I may dip my toes
into the waters of true crime

1369
01:26:25.708 --> 01:26:27.375
this next time around.

1370
01:26:27.375 --> 01:26:29.417
- Ladies and gentlemen.
Ashley Dunn.

1371
01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:31.792
(applause)
- Go. Ashley! Woo!

1372
01:26:31.792 --> 01:26:33.833
(cheering)
