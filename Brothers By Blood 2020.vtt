3
00:00:33.843 --> 00:00:35.645
Here we go.

4
00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:37.880
Right.

5
00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:49.659
You guys know
where I was this afternoon?

6
00:00:49.692 --> 00:00:52.795
Did I tell you?
The proctologist.

7
00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.898
My doctor sent me to have
a proctologist examination.

8
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.735
They got an inverted chair

9
00:00:58.768 --> 00:01:02.571
that tilts up.
with stirrups. right.

10
00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.874
gives them a better
look at your asshole.

11
00:01:04.907 --> 00:01:07.275
So while I'm sitting there.
looking at this thing.

12
00:01:07.309 --> 00:01:08.611
right. this nurse comes in.

13
00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:12.481
She pulls out
a tube of lubricant.

14
00:01:12.514 --> 00:01:14.651
right. out of her uniform.

15
00:01:14.684 --> 00:01:15.852
She takes it out.

16
00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:17.920
she squirts a little bit
on her finger.

17
00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:19.454
make sure
it's coming out all right.

18
00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:20.690
and she lays that
on the table.

19
00:01:20.723 --> 00:01:22.892
right next
to the shiny instruments.

20
00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:25.193
Starting to get nervous.

21
00:01:25.227 --> 00:01:27.329
So she comes over to me...

22
00:01:27.362 --> 00:01:29.932
and she says. "If you go ahead
and slip out of your trousers

23
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.668
"and your fucking underwear.

24
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:33.535
"the doctor will be
with you in a minute."

25
00:01:35.938 --> 00:01:37.874
So she goes and walks
towards the door.

26
00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:39.876
she stops all of a sudden.
she looks me in the eye.

27
00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.511
and she says.
"Relaxation is the key."

28
00:01:42.544 --> 00:01:43.412
And I'm like. "What?"

29
00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:45.748
She's like.
"The more relaxed you are.

30
00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:47.617
"the quicker
we'll be out of here."

31
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.317
So she fucking leaves.

32
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:51.688
I'm looking at
this upside-down chair

33
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:53.823
and these shiny
fucking instruments

34
00:01:53.856 --> 00:01:56.626
and this tube of lubricant.
and I'm like. "How the fuck

35
00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.895
"am I supposed to
relax myself in here. right?

36
00:01:58.928 --> 00:02:00.195
"What can I do?"

37
00:02:01.097 --> 00:02:03.231
You jerked off
in the doctor's office?

38
00:02:03.265 --> 00:02:05.635
You're goddamn...
I jerked the fuck off

39
00:02:05.668 --> 00:02:08.638
and put that shit in the
trash can under the desk.

40
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:10.807
I did. I fucking did too.

41
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.409
What if the nurse forgot one
of the instruments and came back in?

42
00:02:14.443 --> 00:02:17.714
Maybe she'd stick her pinky
up my butt. help me finish up.

43
00:02:17.747 --> 00:02:19.716
You're a dirty little
fuck. ain't ya?

44
00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:22.551
So. like. um...

45
00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:23.786
Like. how much money

46
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.621
do you make
on a site like this?

47
00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:27.690
I've got 20 roofers
working up here.

48
00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:31.560
How many of 'em
really work up here?

49
00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.031
Maybe three?

50
00:02:36.498 --> 00:02:38.300
That shit is
easy money. right?

51
00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:40.335
Ain't no such thing
as easy money.

52
00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.337
You have no idea
what I had to do to get this.

53
00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:44.907
Hey. Peter!
What are you doing?

54
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:46.676
You wanna piss
over the side?

55
00:02:50.412 --> 00:02:51.714
What the fuck?

56
00:02:54.717 --> 00:02:56.052
What the fuck?

57
00:02:56.085 --> 00:02:58.353
Holy fucking shit!

58
00:03:03.926 --> 00:03:05.460
Peter! Peter!

59
00:03:05.494 --> 00:03:07.429
What the fuck. man?
Are you all right?

60
00:03:08.197 --> 00:03:10.833
Don't worry.
not the first time.

61
00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:12.702
You could have
fucking killed yourself.

62
00:03:18.074 --> 00:03:19.307
Come on.

63
00:03:21.543 --> 00:03:23.579
What the fuck
did you do that for?

64
00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:17.994
Thanks for coming by.

65
00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:19.095
I appreciate it.

66
00:05:19.128 --> 00:05:21.931
It's those journalists that
I was telling you about.

67
00:05:21.964 --> 00:05:23.699
They found out that
the city employed

68
00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:25.968
some of my family members.

69
00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:28.671
and pretty soon those people
are all gonna be without a job.

70
00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:29.739
How many?

71
00:05:30.572 --> 00:05:31.707
Six.

72
00:05:34.143 --> 00:05:35.912
- He's gonna win.
- Who? Cruz?

73
00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:37.046
No. Trump.

74
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:40.016
I'm serious.

75
00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:41.050
I'll vote for him.

76
00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:44.787
He made billions.
he can run this fucking country.

77
00:05:46.222 --> 00:05:48.224
Gentlemen. um...

78
00:05:48.257 --> 00:05:50.793
It'll be extremely helpful
to me if those people

79
00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:53.896
that I just mentioned
are viewed as. um.

80
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.601
immediately employable
in some other avenues of life.

81
00:05:58.634 --> 00:06:01.436
Please tell me you ain't asking
me to make your mother a roofer?

82
00:06:02.738 --> 00:06:04.572
No. that's not
what I'm asking.

83
00:06:04.607 --> 00:06:06.474
Then what are you
asking me exactly?

84
00:06:06.508 --> 00:06:07.977
I don't know. um...

85
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.477
Maybe you need
a new secretary.

86
00:06:12.248 --> 00:06:15.017
You give all the work
around here to companies

87
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:16.752
employing roofers
that ain't union.

88
00:06:16.786 --> 00:06:19.055
but you're asking me
to help you?

89
00:06:26.295 --> 00:06:28.563
I want the pier at the
Delaware River waterfront.

90
00:06:30.299 --> 00:06:31.767
I can't do that.

91
00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:34.170
That's... That's impossible.

92
00:06:34.203 --> 00:06:36.205
Why?

93
00:06:39.742 --> 00:06:40.977
I think you know why.

94
00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:47.817
Go ask your Italian friends
to help your mama.

95
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.618
Yeah?

96
00:06:55.257 --> 00:06:56.258
Where?

97
00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:00.963
What's going on?

98
00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:06.736
O'Meara is dead.

99
00:07:26.188 --> 00:07:27.823
What happened?

100
00:07:31.794 --> 00:07:33.229
Michael. what happened?

101
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.732
Apparently some guys just
picked him up on the street.

102
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.235
They what?

103
00:07:39.268 --> 00:07:40.703
These guys just picked him up
on the street.

104
00:07:40.736 --> 00:07:42.038
and he just gets
in the car with them.

105
00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:43.973
He don't even try
to run or anything.

106
00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.077
What the hell
is wrong with people?

107
00:07:49.745 --> 00:07:50.946
It's like they want to die.

108
00:07:51.914 --> 00:07:54.884
- He had kids. right?
- Yeah. three of them.

109
00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:56.819
His wife. she divorced him?

110
00:07:56.852 --> 00:07:58.621
Yeah. she left.

111
00:07:58.654 --> 00:08:01.090
We ought to take care of the kids for him.
But none for her.

112
00:08:02.224 --> 00:08:03.759
Not a fuckin' cent.

113
00:08:04.827 --> 00:08:06.796
We'll pay for the funeral.

114
00:08:32.388 --> 00:08:34.023
That kid is really good. man.

115
00:08:37.827 --> 00:08:39.695
Did you talk to his dad?

116
00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.130
He's a crackhead.

117
00:08:41.163 --> 00:08:42.998
The kid's stayin'
at my place.

118
00:09:11.193 --> 00:09:13.262
The question is.
who put him in the car?

119
00:09:17.066 --> 00:09:18.968
I don't fucking
know who did it.

120
00:09:19.001 --> 00:09:20.803
The guy just got killed.

121
00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:29.311
Well... I know we got to
respond to this in a way

122
00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:32.281
that it ain't gonna happen again.
I mean. that I can tell you.

123
00:09:32.314 --> 00:09:34.283
You don't know who.
you don't know why.

124
00:09:34.316 --> 00:09:35.951
and you want to go to war?

125
00:09:41.957 --> 00:09:45.227
Do you remember when
O'Meara got me my first lay?

126
00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:46.962
No.

127
00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.432
Day I turned 12.

128
00:09:50.466 --> 00:09:52.301
he let me baby-dick

129
00:09:52.334 --> 00:09:54.203
that hooker in the backseat
of his Caddy.

130
00:09:59.275 --> 00:10:04.013
Ahh. ahh. ahh!
You guys.

131
00:10:04.046 --> 00:10:06.849
look at what we've done
to this fucking place.

132
00:10:06.882 --> 00:10:08.484
Hey. I just
hired a new cook.

133
00:10:08.517 --> 00:10:10.986
Do you where he's from?
Paris. France.

134
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.254
They eat fucking frogs
over there.

135
00:10:12.288 --> 00:10:16.025
No. Jesus Christ.
it's not that we're serving French food.

136
00:10:16.058 --> 00:10:18.194
Like I said. it's just that
the chef comes from France.

137
00:10:18.227 --> 00:10:20.996
- Fuck France.
- He says fuck France.

138
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.266
Hey. look. you guys
remember Grace?

139
00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:26.869
What. your sister?

140
00:10:26.902 --> 00:10:28.270
- Grace.
- Yes.

141
00:10:28.304 --> 00:10:31.106
- Holy shit. Grace?
- Mmm-hmm. Yep.

142
00:10:32.441 --> 00:10:34.376
No fucking way.

143
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.378
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you!

144
00:10:36.412 --> 00:10:38.347
Look at you! Shit!

145
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.883
I thought you were...

146
00:10:40.916 --> 00:10:42.952
I thought you were living
down in Florida with your mom?

147
00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:45.154
Um. I was.
but I am going to Jefferson now.

148
00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:46.522
- Ah.
- Mmm-hmm.

149
00:10:46.555 --> 00:10:47.790
Grace is gonna
work at the bar

150
00:10:47.823 --> 00:10:49.325
and stay at my place
for a while.

151
00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:51.026
- Fantastic!
- Mmm-hmm.

152
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.861
Look at you.
look how beautiful she is.

153
00:10:52.895 --> 00:10:55.130
Like no fucking way
she's your sister.

154
00:10:55.164 --> 00:10:57.266
Let's get some fucking
champagne or something...

155
00:10:57.299 --> 00:10:59.101
- Yeah!
- Let's celebrate.

156
00:10:59.134 --> 00:11:00.903
- Yes.
- Good job. Jimmy.

157
00:11:00.936 --> 00:11:02.404
Okay.
Know what I'm saying?

158
00:11:02.438 --> 00:11:04.807
Excited? Yeah.
I definitely am.

159
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.113
That was really fucking good.
That was excellent.

160
00:11:11.146 --> 00:11:12.481
- Pretty good one. right?
- Yeah.

161
00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:49.985
Okay? Huh?

162
00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:51.920
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right. man.

163
00:11:51.954 --> 00:11:53.155
You good?

164
00:12:07.503 --> 00:12:08.937
Are you all right?

165
00:12:08.971 --> 00:12:10.406
Yeah. perfect

166
00:12:20.049 --> 00:12:22.619
Here. Let's go home.

167
00:12:22.652 --> 00:12:25.154
- One more drink.
- No. come on.

168
00:12:25.187 --> 00:12:26.522
It's late. let's...

169
00:12:26.555 --> 00:12:29.325
- Nah. I gotta have one more drink. Peter.
- Let's go home.

170
00:12:29.358 --> 00:12:32.261
You're a good guy.
just...

171
00:12:32.294 --> 00:12:34.229
You're a good guy.
your cousin too.

172
00:12:34.263 --> 00:12:36.532
He helped me out with the
restaurant and everything...

173
00:12:36.565 --> 00:12:39.068
- What do you mean?
- What?

174
00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:41.937
- What do you mean?
- Just trying to say thank you.

175
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.640
that you helped me out
with the restaurant

176
00:12:43.673 --> 00:12:45.908
- and everything...
- No. no. no. no. Did you...

177
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:49.311
Did you borrow money
from Michael? Did you?

178
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.582
Because if you did.
don't sit around thinking

179
00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:54.450
it's gonna take care
of itself. It's not.

180
00:12:54.483 --> 00:12:56.518
It's not a friendly thing.
do you understand that?

181
00:12:56.552 --> 00:12:58.053
Hey. hold on a second.

182
00:12:58.087 --> 00:13:00.389
hold on a second.
we grew up together. right?

183
00:13:00.422 --> 00:13:02.558
What the fuck do you mean?
He's your cousin. man.

184
00:13:02.592 --> 00:13:04.326
Yeah. he's my...
Exactly. you said it.

185
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.495
He's my cousin.
not yours.

186
00:13:08.197 --> 00:13:09.632
How much?

187
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.168
I don't know.
I don't remember.

188
00:13:13.202 --> 00:13:16.238
You don't remember?
Well. he remembers everything.

189
00:13:16.271 --> 00:13:18.374
Don't get in too deep.
I'm telling you.

190
00:13:18.407 --> 00:13:19.975
Don't fuck with him.

191
00:13:22.144 --> 00:13:23.613
I only borrowed a little money
for the restaurant.

192
00:13:23.646 --> 00:13:25.114
I'm gonna pay him back soon.

193
00:13:27.416 --> 00:13:28.585
I am.

194
00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:32.287
It's not gonna be a problem.

195
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:34.089
- Jimmy?
- Yeah.

196
00:13:36.258 --> 00:13:39.361
Don't forget what I said.

197
00:13:39.395 --> 00:13:40.996
No. no. no. no.

198
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:43.600
No. I know.

199
00:14:28.544 --> 00:14:30.045
Stop!

200
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.314
The fuck...

201
00:15:07.817 --> 00:15:10.552
- Hello.
- <i>Peter. it's me.</i>

202
00:15:10.587 --> 00:15:12.689
Jimmy. I'm sleeping.

203
00:15:12.722 --> 00:15:14.423
<i>It's Michael. He got shot.</i>

204
00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:16.091
What?

205
00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:18.393
<i>They were waiting for him
in front of the restaurant.</i>

206
00:15:18.427 --> 00:15:20.429
<i>I wasn't there.
But Grace was. and she said...</i>

207
00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:22.231
Is he dead?

208
00:15:39.448 --> 00:15:42.017
- Where is he?
- In there.

209
00:15:43.452 --> 00:15:45.087
Go on in.

210
00:16:05.107 --> 00:16:07.577
Remember when we
got our first paychecks?

211
00:16:09.311 --> 00:16:11.547
And we got wasted
up on that roof?

212
00:16:14.784 --> 00:16:16.552
You jumped.

213
00:16:17.587 --> 00:16:19.555
Busted your tailbone.

214
00:16:21.156 --> 00:16:24.426
I thought you did it
to pick up a disability check.

215
00:16:24.459 --> 00:16:28.463
but you never missed
a day's work.

216
00:16:35.872 --> 00:16:37.607
Who did this?

217
00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:42.210
Michael?

218
00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:49.351
Bono's men.

219
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.089
- Why?
- What don't you understand?

220
00:16:54.924 --> 00:16:57.392
The Italians killed O'Meara.

221
00:16:59.361 --> 00:17:00.897
and now
they're trying to do me.

222
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.497
Why did they kill him?

223
00:17:02.531 --> 00:17:05.133
They want what we got.

224
00:17:06.468 --> 00:17:08.136
I need your help. Peter.

225
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.475
If I'm gonna hold on to this.

226
00:17:15.712 --> 00:17:17.647
I gotta have somebody
I can trust.

227
00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:21.684
What. they want it all.
or they want a share?

228
00:17:21.718 --> 00:17:23.786
What's the fucking difference?

229
00:17:25.487 --> 00:17:27.255
Now it's a share.

230
00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:29.759
but tomorrow they'll take
everything from us.

231
00:17:30.693 --> 00:17:32.762
You know
we can't fight them.

232
00:17:32.795 --> 00:17:35.865
They want a share?
Just give it to them.

233
00:17:35.898 --> 00:17:38.433
We don't have to do
what they say anymore.

234
00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:42.772
- The streets belong to me.
- Michael listen to me.

235
00:17:44.674 --> 00:17:47.309
Your father made a deal
a long time ago.

236
00:17:48.778 --> 00:17:51.914
It's lasted so long that
everyone who made it is dead.

237
00:17:51.948 --> 00:17:54.416
And before him.
they killed McCullough.

238
00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:56.919
because he was fucking with
the Italians in Atlantic City.

239
00:17:59.589 --> 00:18:01.691
They realized that the jobs
are still a source of money

240
00:18:01.724 --> 00:18:03.826
and power in the city.

241
00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.328
and that you still control it.

242
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:07.897
If you don't give them
what they want.

243
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.667
- you know what's gonna happen.
- You have to be on my side.

244
00:18:12.534 --> 00:18:14.369
You're my brother.

245
00:18:15.504 --> 00:18:17.439
You're the only one
I can trust.

246
00:18:37.259 --> 00:18:38.527
What's going on?

247
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.903
Come sit down.

248
00:18:46.936 --> 00:18:49.371
What the fuck is going on?

249
00:18:49.404 --> 00:18:51.573
- What are you all doing here?
- It's the baby.

250
00:18:53.542 --> 00:18:54.744
She...

251
00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.582
She got hit by a car.

252
00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.686
Look. it was nobody's fault.

253
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.922
- The fucking guy's car slid...
- What guy?

254
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:08.825
The neighbor.

255
00:19:10.425 --> 00:19:12.494
You mean Victor Kopec?
The cop?

256
00:19:14.931 --> 00:19:16.833
Charley! Charley. stop!
Charley!

257
00:19:16.866 --> 00:19:18.433
- Get off of me!
- No. no.

258
00:19:18.467 --> 00:19:19.869
Get the fuck off of me.
Let me go!

259
00:19:19.902 --> 00:19:22.404
Let me fucking go!
Get off!

260
00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.547
Now that's an excellent horse.

261
00:19:32.582 --> 00:19:34.449
There ain't nothing
wrong with her.

262
00:19:36.753 --> 00:19:39.354
It's got fucking
spaghetti legs.

263
00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:40.690
She's come from a long line

264
00:19:40.723 --> 00:19:41.791
of champions.
the bloodline...

265
00:19:41.824 --> 00:19:44.459
I don't give a fuck
where she comes from.

266
00:19:44.493 --> 00:19:45.895
Fuck that horse.

267
00:19:45.928 --> 00:19:47.764
- Mr. Flood...
- Fuck you!

268
00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.503
Can you believe
this motherfucker

269
00:19:54.536 --> 00:19:56.005
trying to sell me
a horse like that?

270
00:19:56.038 --> 00:19:57.774
Tell him I want a big horse.

271
00:19:57.807 --> 00:20:00.575
- That horse look big to you?
- Yeah. it's a racehorse.

272
00:20:02.912 --> 00:20:04.847
- That's a shit horse.
- No. it's a racehorse.

273
00:20:04.881 --> 00:20:07.482
That's a shit horse.
I can spot a champion when I see one.

274
00:20:07.516 --> 00:20:08.851
and that's a fucking
shit horse.

275
00:20:08.885 --> 00:20:10.485
What do you know
about horses?

276
00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:13.656
You like boxing?
I like horses.

277
00:20:16.525 --> 00:20:17.927
Whatever. man.

278
00:20:20.096 --> 00:20:22.899
Hey. that kid
Carlos is training...

279
00:20:22.932 --> 00:20:24.499
Jimmy tells me he's special.

280
00:20:26.468 --> 00:20:28.537
Jimmy doesn't know shit
about fighting.

281
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.305
So is the kid good or not?

282
00:20:31.908 --> 00:20:33.810
Yeah. he's good enough.

283
00:20:33.843 --> 00:20:35.812
Maybe you talk to him.

284
00:20:35.845 --> 00:20:37.046
maybe we get him somewhere.

285
00:20:37.079 --> 00:20:39.514
- Get him somewhere?
- Hmm.

286
00:20:39.548 --> 00:20:40.616
He is good where he is.

287
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:41.884
The kid could make
some money now.

288
00:20:41.918 --> 00:20:42.885
that ain't going
to last forever.

289
00:20:42.919 --> 00:20:44.821
That's all I'm saying.
Maybe you talk to him.

290
00:20:44.854 --> 00:20:45.988
let him know we help him.

291
00:20:46.022 --> 00:20:48.557
They don't need us
to make money.

292
00:20:48.591 --> 00:20:50.525
I told you.
he's good where he is.

293
00:20:53.763 --> 00:20:56.065
Relax.

294
00:20:56.098 --> 00:20:58.701
You talk about these guys like
they're family or something.

295
00:21:04.941 --> 00:21:07.009
- Hey.
- Hey.

296
00:21:08.778 --> 00:21:10.713
Can I get a beer?

297
00:21:14.016 --> 00:21:15.017
Yep.

298
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:20.923
How's. uh...

299
00:21:20.957 --> 00:21:22.959
- How's Michael doing?
- He's all right.

300
00:21:22.992 --> 00:21:25.928
What about you?
Sounds like you were pretty close.

301
00:21:25.962 --> 00:21:27.630
I was still inside
closing up.

302
00:21:29.665 --> 00:21:32.001
I didn't hear the gunshot.
just heard people screaming.

303
00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.710
Jimmy told me you're working
for Michael now.

304
00:21:44.013 --> 00:21:46.849
- No. I'm just helping out.
- Doing what?

305
00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:51.721
Don't tell me
you're a roofer.

306
00:21:53.956 --> 00:21:56.491
You know what we do.

307
00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:59.427
Jimmy grew up with us.
It's not a secret.

308
00:21:59.461 --> 00:22:01.631
Taking over
the family business?

309
00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:03.633
Yeah. kind of.

310
00:22:03.666 --> 00:22:05.935
You know. when we were kids.

311
00:22:05.968 --> 00:22:08.170
I always thought that you were
different than your cousin.

312
00:23:04.226 --> 00:23:05.795
Oh. look at him go.

313
00:23:07.096 --> 00:23:10.733
Look. I know that in his mind.
he thinks he's a real boxer.

314
00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:12.601
He thinks that he can be
a world champion one day.

315
00:23:14.937 --> 00:23:17.073
Fucking give it up. Peter.
You look like dog shit.

316
00:23:19.241 --> 00:23:21.043
- How you are doing. Carlos?
- I'm okay.

317
00:23:25.114 --> 00:23:26.115
I was...

318
00:23:28.084 --> 00:23:29.785
I was wondering
if the kid was around.

319
00:23:29.819 --> 00:23:32.520
Maybe he could give my man
Lenny here a couple of rounds.

320
00:23:32.554 --> 00:23:34.256
He's run to Jersey
for some parts.

321
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.992
He works for me now.
at the garage.

322
00:23:36.025 --> 00:23:37.994
Oh. to Jersey?

323
00:23:38.027 --> 00:23:39.862
He gonna come back.
or what. eh?

324
00:23:42.331 --> 00:23:43.833
Don't worry about him.

325
00:23:43.866 --> 00:23:46.035
He just wants to move
a few rounds with the kid.

326
00:23:48.671 --> 00:23:49.772
Just taking it real easy.

327
00:23:50.773 --> 00:23:52.041
What do you say. Carlos?

328
00:23:52.074 --> 00:23:53.275
I told you. he's in Jersey.

329
00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:55.945
Oh. shit. look at that.

330
00:23:56.912 --> 00:23:57.913
There he is.

331
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:00.182
How you doing. Ryan?

332
00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:02.084
How was Jersey?

333
00:24:02.952 --> 00:24:04.253
What's the weather like
over there?

334
00:24:08.157 --> 00:24:09.825
How are you doing?
I've been hearing good things about you.

335
00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:11.660
You look strong.

336
00:24:12.628 --> 00:24:14.296
- What's your weight?
- 125.

337
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.032
A buck twenty-five?

338
00:24:16.065 --> 00:24:19.235
What do you say you give my man
Lenny here a couple of rounds?

339
00:24:19.268 --> 00:24:20.603
I wanna see you guys move.

340
00:24:22.038 --> 00:24:23.239
Three rounds?

341
00:24:25.274 --> 00:24:27.977
Three. four. five.
Whatever you want.

342
00:24:28.878 --> 00:24:30.179
He said...

343
00:24:30.212 --> 00:24:32.948
He thinks
he can kick your ass.

344
00:24:32.982 --> 00:24:34.984
I don't think so.
I wanna see you work. kid.

345
00:24:35.017 --> 00:24:36.018
Come on. Let's go.

346
00:24:37.019 --> 00:24:38.087
Man. it's gonna be fun.

347
00:24:40.289 --> 00:24:42.058
Let's go.

348
00:24:45.061 --> 00:24:46.962
There's no
reason to do this. man.

349
00:24:48.931 --> 00:24:50.866
I wanna see the kid work.
that's the reason.

350
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.234
You keep saying
how fucking good he is.

351
00:24:52.268 --> 00:24:53.669
I wanna see if he can fight.

352
00:24:54.804 --> 00:24:56.272
So why don't you come by
next week.

353
00:24:56.305 --> 00:24:57.572
and you can see him work?

354
00:24:57.606 --> 00:25:00.042
You don't have to bring in a
fucking monkey. It's insulting.

355
00:25:00.076 --> 00:25:03.045
So somebody's insulted.
So the fuck what?

356
00:25:05.381 --> 00:25:07.249
Hey. by the way.
where were you last night?

357
00:25:08.851 --> 00:25:09.885
At the restaurant.

358
00:25:10.419 --> 00:25:11.620
Oh. yeah?

359
00:25:13.022 --> 00:25:14.023
With Jimmy?

360
00:25:18.928 --> 00:25:20.229
Yo. check it out.
A fight.

361
00:25:20.262 --> 00:25:21.263
Yo. we gonna do this?

362
00:25:23.566 --> 00:25:25.367
All right.
Let's see what my monkey can do.

363
00:26:03.205 --> 00:26:04.673
Hey. he's
a buck twenty-five. Lenny.

364
00:26:05.107 --> 00:26:06.108
Touch him.

365
00:26:06.842 --> 00:26:08.744
Yeah. There it is.

366
00:26:17.987 --> 00:26:18.988
The fuck?

367
00:26:19.889 --> 00:26:21.223
What the fuck?

368
00:26:21.257 --> 00:26:22.892
What the fuck are you doing?

369
00:26:23.292 --> 00:26:24.827
Get the fuck up.

370
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.328
Get... Wake the fuck up.

371
00:26:28.264 --> 00:26:29.431
He's. like. half your size.

372
00:26:30.966 --> 00:26:32.902
You let him knock you out
like that?

373
00:26:32.935 --> 00:26:34.436
You're right.
he's a fucking monkey.

374
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:35.938
Get the fuck up.

375
00:26:35.971 --> 00:26:37.173
Get the fuck out of there.

376
00:26:37.206 --> 00:26:38.440
Get the fuck out of the ring.

377
00:26:40.409 --> 00:26:42.011
Get the fuck up. Lenny.
Get out of here.

378
00:26:42.545 --> 00:26:43.746
Don't bleed in my car.

379
00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.015
Be in touch. Ryan.

380
00:26:46.682 --> 00:26:48.851
Very nice. Very. very nice.

381
00:27:09.338 --> 00:27:10.339
Your dad here?

382
00:27:12.007 --> 00:27:13.008
Go get him.

383
00:27:26.855 --> 00:27:27.990
I told you
not to come in here.

384
00:27:29.091 --> 00:27:30.092
What do you want?

385
00:27:31.293 --> 00:27:32.294
Uncle Phil's here.

386
00:27:40.402 --> 00:27:41.971
So what are you doing here?

387
00:27:42.004 --> 00:27:44.173
The guy's
calling Constantine

388
00:27:44.206 --> 00:27:46.041
eleven times a day.
sayin' you're gonna do him.

389
00:27:46.075 --> 00:27:47.476
All right.
don't tell me you're comin' in here.

390
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:48.578
telling me what I'm gonna do.

391
00:27:48.612 --> 00:27:50.012
No. I came to tell you
what you ain't going to do.

392
00:27:51.013 --> 00:27:54.216
He's helpin'
the Italians on some...

393
00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.384
On some things. Charley.

394
00:27:56.085 --> 00:27:58.554
Constantine don't want him hurt.

395
00:27:58.588 --> 00:28:01.790
There's lots of cops
helpin' him on some things.

396
00:28:01.824 --> 00:28:04.393
How come this one's
got to move in next door.

397
00:28:04.426 --> 00:28:07.229
in an Irish neighborhood.
the place where we grew up.

398
00:28:07.263 --> 00:28:08.364
and drive his
big old convertible

399
00:28:08.397 --> 00:28:11.233
up and down the street
like some Center City pimp?

400
00:28:13.302 --> 00:28:15.037
The guy took my baby. Phil!

401
00:28:17.439 --> 00:28:18.874
He took my baby.

402
00:28:20.175 --> 00:28:22.044
It was an accident.

403
00:28:22.077 --> 00:28:23.846
Constantine don't want
the guy touched.

404
00:28:23.879 --> 00:28:25.481
Yeah. well. fuck Constantine!

405
00:28:25.514 --> 00:28:28.050
And fuck the Italians.

406
00:28:28.083 --> 00:28:30.119
First they're in our business.
now they're in my house?

407
00:28:30.152 --> 00:28:31.220
The man skidded.

408
00:28:32.388 --> 00:28:34.390
If it was something else.

409
00:28:34.423 --> 00:28:36.593
I'd have taken care of him myself.
right there. that afternoon.

410
00:28:36.626 --> 00:28:38.861
You know what? You can get
the fuck out of here!

411
00:28:59.616 --> 00:29:00.816
Dad?

412
00:29:02.885 --> 00:29:03.886
Go to bed.

413
00:29:17.667 --> 00:29:20.603
- Hello?
- <i>Hey. Peter. it's Bono.</i>

414
00:29:20.637 --> 00:29:23.439
<i>I understand you've got medical
problems in the family...</i>

415
00:29:23.472 --> 00:29:27.276
- Yeah. what do you want?
- <i>Maybe we should talk about it.</i>

416
00:29:27.309 --> 00:29:29.545
<i>Or you might be thinking of
takin' over the business.</i>

417
00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.881
<i>So maybe we can
work something out.</i>

418
00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:35.951
<i>Think about it and call me.</i>

419
00:29:58.407 --> 00:29:59.408
Who's this guy?

420
00:30:20.597 --> 00:30:21.598
I gotta talk to you.

421
00:30:36.445 --> 00:30:38.547
Sometimes I wonder what the
fuck I need you for in the first place.

422
00:30:39.515 --> 00:30:41.016
I get shot. you're not around.

423
00:30:42.184 --> 00:30:44.353
I come up to Carlos'.
and you act like

424
00:30:44.386 --> 00:30:45.921
you're ashamed we're cousins.

425
00:30:47.423 --> 00:30:49.158
What are all these knuckleheads
doing out here?

426
00:30:51.761 --> 00:30:53.663
- We're making a move.
- You're making a move?

427
00:30:55.063 --> 00:30:56.365
Well. they tried to do me.

428
00:30:56.398 --> 00:30:57.667
We're not just gonna do
one of them.

429
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.102
We're going to end this fuckin'
thing. that's what's next.

430
00:31:00.135 --> 00:31:02.705
But the Italians have been around
for. like. what. a hundred years?

431
00:31:02.739 --> 00:31:04.239
And you're gonna end it?

432
00:31:04.273 --> 00:31:06.609
This is Philly. everything
in this fuckin' city's

433
00:31:06.643 --> 00:31:08.043
been around for a hundred years.

434
00:31:08.076 --> 00:31:09.278
Yeah? What are you gonna do?

435
00:31:11.246 --> 00:31:13.282
I'm turning them loose.

436
00:31:13.315 --> 00:31:14.684
Turn them loose? These guys?

437
00:31:14.717 --> 00:31:15.718
Mmm-hmm.

438
00:31:17.486 --> 00:31:19.388
The only way to do that

439
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:22.357
is when you tell them exactly
what it is you want them to do.

440
00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:24.761
And then you promise them
that you'll cut off their hand

441
00:31:24.794 --> 00:31:27.262
if they do it in any other way.
You hear me?

442
00:31:27.296 --> 00:31:30.065
And maybe.
maybe if you're lucky.

443
00:31:31.634 --> 00:31:34.069
you'll only get jammed up
half of the time.

444
00:31:34.102 --> 00:31:35.370
But we ain't jammed up.

445
00:31:35.404 --> 00:31:36.405
You're not?

446
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.508
We know who did O'Meara.

447
00:31:46.448 --> 00:31:47.449
I'm telling you...

448
00:31:48.685 --> 00:31:50.419
You put these guys
on the street.

449
00:31:50.452 --> 00:31:52.187
I'm out. I'm going to Hawaii.

450
00:31:54.624 --> 00:31:56.058
You want them off the street?

451
00:31:57.594 --> 00:31:59.328
Then you take care of business
with me.

452
00:32:03.165 --> 00:32:04.333
Or go to fucking Hawaii.

453
00:32:05.768 --> 00:32:06.769
and don't come back.

454
00:33:00.522 --> 00:33:01.658
Pour that one out. please.

455
00:33:03.225 --> 00:33:04.226
Why?

456
00:33:05.394 --> 00:33:07.129
Somebody died.

457
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.531
Pour it.

458
00:33:33.422 --> 00:33:34.624
So. what happened to
your mother...

459
00:33:37.292 --> 00:33:39.161
She got scared of things
that wasn't there.

460
00:33:42.264 --> 00:33:44.132
First. she wouldn't go out
by herself.

461
00:33:45.802 --> 00:33:47.569
then she wouldn't go out
even if I was with her.

462
00:33:49.438 --> 00:33:52.207
Then. finally. it scared her
so bad that

463
00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.142
she's afraid to even move
her little finger.

464
00:33:56.545 --> 00:33:58.447
She thinks if she moves
her little finger.

465
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:01.818
it wakes up.

466
00:34:03.385 --> 00:34:05.387
and remembers
what happened to your sister.

467
00:34:06.656 --> 00:34:09.157
She thinks if she just keeps
everything still.

468
00:34:09.892 --> 00:34:11.126
it don't hurt.

469
00:34:13.395 --> 00:34:14.396
I wanna see her.

470
00:34:18.601 --> 00:34:20.637
It ain't the kind of hospital
you can visit her.

471
00:35:15.792 --> 00:35:16.859
They. uh...

472
00:35:18.995 --> 00:35:20.930
They wouldn't let me
get my dogs.

473
00:35:25.968 --> 00:35:28.671
Who'd... Who would want to
burn up a couple little dogs?

474
00:35:54.831 --> 00:35:56.833
- Let's take your shoes off.
- Okay.

475
00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.835
Okay.

476
00:36:15.918 --> 00:36:16.919
He was there.

477
00:36:20.322 --> 00:36:21.591
He was there when it happened.

478
00:36:32.602 --> 00:36:34.604
Listen. they're not
looking for Jimmy.

479
00:36:37.974 --> 00:36:39.274
You're safe. don't worry.

480
00:36:40.109 --> 00:36:41.309
Don't worry.

481
00:36:45.047 --> 00:36:46.381
Peter. what's going on?

482
00:36:47.817 --> 00:36:50.987
Oh...

483
00:36:57.927 --> 00:36:59.494
Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy.
what are you doing?

484
00:36:59.528 --> 00:37:01.631
Come on. get up. Get up.

485
00:37:01.664 --> 00:37:03.065
Get up.

486
00:37:03.099 --> 00:37:04.867
Get up.

487
00:37:04.901 --> 00:37:06.769
Come on.

488
00:37:06.803 --> 00:37:08.771
They wouldn't let me
get the dogs.

489
00:37:08.805 --> 00:37:10.907
I told them.

490
00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.542
"I don't care
what you do.

491
00:37:13.575 --> 00:37:16.344
"just let me get my dogs
out of your way."

492
00:37:19.548 --> 00:37:21.416
I asked him.
the guy at the door.

493
00:37:23.552 --> 00:37:25.988
I said.
"Could I please have the dog?"

494
00:37:26.022 --> 00:37:27.723
And he wouldn't
answer me.

495
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.460
And I can hear 'em
in the back.

496
00:37:32.494 --> 00:37:33.461
barking at the one
in the basement.

497
00:37:33.495 --> 00:37:35.530
but the guy at the door
wouldn't let me in.

498
00:37:46.809 --> 00:37:49.444
Here you go.

499
00:37:49.477 --> 00:37:52.480
Here you go.

500
00:38:04.559 --> 00:38:05.595
Tell me what happened.

501
00:38:06.162 --> 00:38:07.529
I told them.

502
00:38:07.562 --> 00:38:10.166
"it's none of my business
what you're doing.

503
00:38:10.199 --> 00:38:12.702
"just let get my dogs
out of there first."

504
00:38:12.735 --> 00:38:16.404
And he wouldn't answer me.

505
00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.407
And then...

506
00:38:19.441 --> 00:38:22.444
Only. I didn't want to
go in there.

507
00:38:22.477 --> 00:38:24.914
'Cause if I walk in there.
I'm dead. and...

508
00:38:27.016 --> 00:38:28.851
I ain't even got nothing
to do with this.

509
00:38:32.021 --> 00:38:34.556
And then. the one at the door

510
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:37.994
said that I better. uh.
go call Michael.

511
00:38:38.027 --> 00:38:39.929
and tell him what's happening
to his place.

512
00:38:42.497 --> 00:38:44.166
I said. "It's my place.

513
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.002
"It isn't Michael's."

514
00:38:46.035 --> 00:38:47.970
But he just says

515
00:38:48.004 --> 00:38:49.739
I better go back
across the street.

516
00:38:49.772 --> 00:38:52.975
So. I go call Michael.

517
00:38:54.542 --> 00:38:55.945
but then Leonard says
he's asleep.

518
00:38:57.013 --> 00:38:59.649
And then.
while I'm on the phone.

519
00:39:01.584 --> 00:39:03.119
I hear a noise.

520
00:39:03.152 --> 00:39:05.688
It sounds like somebody
blowing out a candle.

521
00:39:09.158 --> 00:39:10.626
And it shakes the house.

522
00:39:13.663 --> 00:39:15.463
And then.
when I looked out the window.

523
00:39:17.066 --> 00:39:19.101
the inside of the place
is already orange.

524
00:39:58.975 --> 00:40:00.643
The fuck you doing here. huh?

525
00:40:02.111 --> 00:40:03.679
I want to talk to Bono.

526
00:40:03.713 --> 00:40:05.547
I told you to call me.
not to come.

527
00:40:08.617 --> 00:40:09.685
Yeah. it's right here.

528
00:40:15.124 --> 00:40:16.125
Let's go.

529
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.635
- Michael send you?
- No.

530
00:40:26.669 --> 00:40:28.738
What are you doing here?

531
00:40:28.771 --> 00:40:30.606
Shit's getting out of hand.

532
00:40:30.639 --> 00:40:32.540
Yeah. well.
he started it. not me.

533
00:40:33.275 --> 00:40:34.677
That's not what he said.

534
00:40:38.748 --> 00:40:39.782
Oh. yeah?

535
00:40:41.217 --> 00:40:43.819
O'Meara tried to extort my guys.

536
00:40:43.853 --> 00:40:45.221
I asked Michael
if he can fix it.

537
00:40:45.254 --> 00:40:47.089
Michael says sure.
he can fix it.

538
00:40:47.123 --> 00:40:49.025
but he don't do it.

539
00:40:49.058 --> 00:40:51.961
So I do a little investigation.
and guess what?

540
00:40:51.994 --> 00:40:53.662
Him and O'Meara are
working together.

541
00:40:55.664 --> 00:40:58.300
Trying to take
construction sites from us.

542
00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:03.205
So. you know. there's
three sides to every story.

543
00:41:03.239 --> 00:41:05.107
yours. mine. and the truth.

544
00:41:05.141 --> 00:41:07.143
And the truth is he's done.
he's gotta go.

545
00:41:09.879 --> 00:41:11.013
Is there any way

546
00:41:12.882 --> 00:41:13.983
We can just. you know...

547
00:41:16.152 --> 00:41:17.920
I mean. forget about all this?

548
00:41:17.953 --> 00:41:18.954
No.

549
00:41:21.023 --> 00:41:22.291
But you stand to make out.

550
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.227
I'm gonna need somebody.

551
00:41:26.195 --> 00:41:27.830
You understand?

552
00:41:27.863 --> 00:41:29.765
I mean. I can't just
walk into the unions

553
00:41:29.799 --> 00:41:31.167
and announce they're under
new management.

554
00:41:32.935 --> 00:41:34.203
It's kind of hard for me to...

555
00:41:36.105 --> 00:41:37.706
For me to trust you.
you know that?

556
00:41:40.042 --> 00:41:42.645
Oh. no. Peter.
I liked your father.

557
00:41:42.678 --> 00:41:44.346
And Constantine
liked your father.

558
00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.148
Your father was a fuck-up.

559
00:41:50.019 --> 00:41:51.854
The real question here...

560
00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:56.659
Are you just another
stupid Irish fuck?

561
00:42:02.998 --> 00:42:04.100
You want a beer?

562
00:42:06.702 --> 00:42:07.736
Yeah.

563
00:42:13.375 --> 00:42:15.077
First thing about
drinking beer...

564
00:42:16.946 --> 00:42:19.682
Never take the cap off
with your teeth.

565
00:42:19.715 --> 00:42:21.417
It doesn't matter if all
your friends use their teeth.

566
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.952
In the end.
they're gonna break one off.

567
00:42:24.019 --> 00:42:25.054
Wait and see.

568
00:42:28.991 --> 00:42:30.659
It's the same thing
as hittin' walls.

569
00:42:32.128 --> 00:42:35.297
Every Irish wedding
you go to.

570
00:42:35.331 --> 00:42:37.133
there's always gotta be
some guy hitting a wall.

571
00:42:42.872 --> 00:42:44.640
Your Uncle Phil was
a good wall puncher.

572
00:42:51.013 --> 00:42:54.083
The thing about that.
besides it's stupid.

573
00:42:54.116 --> 00:42:56.085
is you can't always tell
where the studs are.

574
00:42:58.721 --> 00:43:01.724
And. man. it's one thing to put
your fist through drywall.

575
00:43:03.959 --> 00:43:05.828
it's something else
when you hit the studs.

576
00:43:13.102 --> 00:43:15.671
There's no excuse for
hurting yourself on purpose.

577
00:43:18.941 --> 00:43:19.975
The Italians know that.

578
00:43:21.844 --> 00:43:22.845
Irish don't.

579
00:43:25.915 --> 00:43:27.149
It's why they run things.

580
00:43:28.918 --> 00:43:29.952
and why we don't.

581
00:43:34.757 --> 00:43:36.392
You like it?

582
00:43:36.425 --> 00:43:38.327
- No.
- Then don't drink it.

583
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.141
Uncle Phil...

584
00:43:54.243 --> 00:43:55.344
I don't really like him.

585
00:43:57.313 --> 00:43:59.748
- Why do you say that?
- I don't know.

586
00:44:02.117 --> 00:44:03.452
He's...

587
00:44:05.921 --> 00:44:07.423
He's fucked up.

588
00:44:15.564 --> 00:44:17.499
Jesus. that's too good.

589
00:44:23.472 --> 00:44:26.208
We take him down to the gallops this morning.

590
00:44:26.242 --> 00:44:27.876
trying to keep everybody happy.

591
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:29.979
get him into shape
so he can race. like you said.

592
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.215
I get the vet to take a picture.

593
00:44:34.049 --> 00:44:35.251
He broke a bone.

594
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:38.354
It's not a bad break.
it's just that...

595
00:44:41.056 --> 00:44:44.493
The truth is.
it's not a very a sound horse.

596
00:44:44.526 --> 00:44:48.497
And sometimes it happens.

597
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:51.567
What you're saying is this horse
that I bought for $80.000

598
00:44:51.601 --> 00:44:53.369
ain't really a racehorse.

599
00:44:53.402 --> 00:44:54.403
It's just...

600
00:44:55.204 --> 00:44:58.140
Horses' legs
are delicate things.

601
00:44:58.173 --> 00:45:00.142
and something happened.

602
00:45:00.175 --> 00:45:04.179
Maybe his breeding was bad.
maybe...

603
00:45:04.213 --> 00:45:06.382
I don't know. he's just
too fucking big.

604
00:45:07.216 --> 00:45:08.951
You think this is funny?

605
00:45:08.984 --> 00:45:10.552
It's too fucking big?

606
00:45:10.587 --> 00:45:13.889
It could be that. it could be
his father. his mother.

607
00:45:13.922 --> 00:45:15.524
You're supposed to shoot those fuckin' things. right?

608
00:45:15.557 --> 00:45:16.925
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

609
00:45:16.959 --> 00:45:18.327
Put that gun away.
Put that gun away.

610
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.962
Get out of the way.

611
00:45:19.995 --> 00:45:21.430
- You're not...
- I own the fucking thing.

612
00:45:21.463 --> 00:45:22.766
You can't shoot the horse.

613
00:45:23.866 --> 00:45:26.535
As long as you have been
around here.

614
00:45:26.568 --> 00:45:27.704
have you ever seen somebody else
shoot their horse?

615
00:45:27.737 --> 00:45:29.538
You ever seen anyone else around
here that's got a horse

616
00:45:29.571 --> 00:45:31.340
that ain't a fucking horse?

617
00:45:31.373 --> 00:45:33.242
Lots of broken down
horses. Mr...

618
00:45:33.275 --> 00:45:36.845
You already talked. telling me
the horse is too big.

619
00:45:36.879 --> 00:45:38.080
My cousin's talking now.
telling me

620
00:45:38.113 --> 00:45:39.348
I can't shoot the motherfucker.

621
00:45:39.381 --> 00:45:41.283
When he's through telling me
what I can do.

622
00:45:41.317 --> 00:45:42.985
then it's your turn again.

623
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.187
Put that gun away.

624
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:49.558
Normally. they inject them.

625
00:45:50.893 --> 00:45:52.961
- With a needle?
- Yeah. nice and easy.

626
00:45:54.897 --> 00:45:56.298
Hmm.

627
00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.868
A needle. Go get it.

628
00:46:03.072 --> 00:46:04.907
What the fuck is wrong with you?

629
00:46:08.911 --> 00:46:10.112
It's my horse.

630
00:46:23.459 --> 00:46:24.526
You the owner?

631
00:46:26.596 --> 00:46:27.930
Owner's signature.

632
00:46:42.712 --> 00:46:44.480
Come on. let's go.

633
00:46:44.513 --> 00:46:45.514
Hold him.

634
00:47:28.323 --> 00:47:34.196
That's... $240. please.

635
00:47:53.583 --> 00:47:56.485
You. uh. want me to have
somebody come get this?

636
00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:02.124
You want me to take care of it.

637
00:48:02.157 --> 00:48:03.660
or you want to have it
done yourself?

638
00:48:05.194 --> 00:48:06.395
I changed my mind.

639
00:48:13.469 --> 00:48:14.737
You hear what I said?

640
00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:17.039
- You said you...
- Michael...

641
00:48:18.273 --> 00:48:20.409
The horse is dead. Let's go.

642
00:48:20.743 --> 00:48:21.744
Come on.

643
00:48:22.579 --> 00:48:23.746
He's a big shot.

644
00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.114
You wanted him to put the horse
down. that's what he did.

645
00:48:26.148 --> 00:48:28.383
Come on. let's go. come on.
Hey.

646
00:48:28.417 --> 00:48:30.687
Hey. Leonard. gimme that bag.

647
00:48:34.389 --> 00:48:35.758
Since when do you decide?

648
00:48:36.759 --> 00:48:38.393
Ain't your horse.

649
00:48:42.064 --> 00:48:43.298
Ain't your business.

650
00:48:46.335 --> 00:48:48.403
Be careful
with that shit. Mr. Flood.

651
00:48:48.437 --> 00:48:50.807
If you got a cut or something
and that gets in.

652
00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.274
it doesn't take much.

653
00:48:52.307 --> 00:48:53.408
Like one drop of this...

654
00:48:53.442 --> 00:48:55.043
It gets in your bloodstream.
yeah.

655
00:48:56.278 --> 00:48:57.279
And if you put this
into a person...

656
00:48:57.312 --> 00:48:59.548
They'd be dead before
you could get it half in.

657
00:49:02.317 --> 00:49:03.653
So how much of this you got?

658
00:49:03.686 --> 00:49:04.754
How much you need?

659
00:49:06.522 --> 00:49:08.591
See. I like this guy better
already.

660
00:49:08.625 --> 00:49:09.692
Let's go.

661
00:49:09.726 --> 00:49:11.794
Come here. Let's... Let's go.

662
00:49:13.228 --> 00:49:14.463
I can have this one here?

663
00:49:14.496 --> 00:49:15.698
All you want.

664
00:49:15.732 --> 00:49:17.700
You don't. you don't mind if I take it?

665
00:49:17.734 --> 00:49:18.735
No. sir.

666
00:49:21.704 --> 00:49:22.739
Thank you.

667
00:49:25.207 --> 00:49:27.509
Sorry. you wanted to
ask me something. right?

668
00:49:27.543 --> 00:49:29.646
Uh. just about taking care
of your horse.

669
00:49:29.679 --> 00:49:31.648
If you wanted me to take care
of him for you.

670
00:49:33.282 --> 00:49:35.785
Yeah. I would appreciate
that very much.

671
00:49:35.818 --> 00:49:37.486
No problem.
I'll do it right now.

672
00:49:37.519 --> 00:49:39.488
But first...

673
00:49:39.521 --> 00:49:41.691
I want you to get
on your fucking knees

674
00:49:42.625 --> 00:49:44.059
and kiss him goodbye.

675
00:50:30.305 --> 00:50:31.440
Morning. Peter.

676
00:50:32.107 --> 00:50:34.109
Want to get in so we could talk?

677
00:50:35.945 --> 00:50:37.446
What do you want to talk about?

678
00:50:40.182 --> 00:50:42.685
Well. we heard a story.

679
00:50:42.719 --> 00:50:45.354
A veterinarian filed a complaint
against Michael.

680
00:50:45.387 --> 00:50:48.357
The vet said Michael made him
kiss a dead horse.

681
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:50.325
Yeah. so what?

682
00:50:50.359 --> 00:50:52.394
Yeah. I can squash
the complaint.

683
00:50:52.427 --> 00:50:55.263
I'll even have my lawyer
draw up the papers.

684
00:50:55.297 --> 00:50:57.232
but what does that say
about your business?

685
00:50:57.265 --> 00:50:58.467
How much longer you think
before someone

686
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.135
pulls it out from under you?

687
00:51:01.804 --> 00:51:05.207
You need help.
we could save it for you.

688
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.175
It's gonna cost you though.

689
00:51:07.209 --> 00:51:08.645
You're gonna kill your brother.

690
00:51:12.247 --> 00:51:15.283
Well. he's not my brother.
he's my cousin.

691
00:51:15.317 --> 00:51:17.654
Oh. well. that makes it a lot
easier then. don't it?

692
00:51:19.254 --> 00:51:21.456
Either way. he's not where
he's at for long.

693
00:51:23.492 --> 00:51:25.695
Don't... I don't hear nothing.
Are you thinking about this?

694
00:51:25.728 --> 00:51:26.929
No. I'm not.

695
00:51:31.266 --> 00:51:32.367
Let me approach this
another way.

696
00:51:32.401 --> 00:51:34.871
Who do you think set up
your father to Constantine?

697
00:51:36.606 --> 00:51:39.776
Somebody wanted what he had.
someone wanted to be like him.

698
00:51:39.809 --> 00:51:41.611
wasn't tough enough
or respected enough

699
00:51:41.644 --> 00:51:42.712
and never would be.

700
00:51:43.146 --> 00:51:44.346
You got no clue?

701
00:51:45.748 --> 00:51:46.816
Your uncle.

702
00:51:49.919 --> 00:51:50.953
No way.

703
00:51:50.987 --> 00:51:52.889
I watched your uncle
bury your dad.

704
00:51:52.922 --> 00:51:55.290
See. I worked for Constantine
back in the day.

705
00:51:56.626 --> 00:51:58.795
I watched your uncle bash
your father's face in.

706
00:51:58.828 --> 00:51:59.862
over and over with the shovel.

707
00:51:59.896 --> 00:52:01.764
so he wouldn't be recognized
when they found him.

708
00:52:01.798 --> 00:52:03.298
Why are you telling me all this?

709
00:52:03.331 --> 00:52:04.867
Oh. so you'd realize
what Michael would do

710
00:52:04.901 --> 00:52:08.236
if he was standing right here
and I made him the same offer.

711
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:10.272
You see. because
at the end of the day.

712
00:52:10.305 --> 00:52:11.808
he's still his father's son.

713
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:15.812
You hear what I'm saying
to you. Petey?

714
00:52:15.845 --> 00:52:16.946
It's your move.

715
00:52:55.517 --> 00:52:56.786
What's going on?

716
00:53:03.593 --> 00:53:05.995
How long until Jimmy's
got a problem with Michael?

717
00:53:07.663 --> 00:53:09.431
What do you mean. a problem?

718
00:53:14.569 --> 00:53:16.371
For the money he owes him.

719
00:53:19.474 --> 00:53:20.810
Stay out of it.

720
00:53:20.843 --> 00:53:24.881
Don't you dare tell me
to stay out of it.

721
00:53:26.048 --> 00:53:28.316
Your cousin came
over here yesterday.

722
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:30.452
put a fucking needle
to my brother's neck.

723
00:53:30.485 --> 00:53:34.456
and told him this is what
they use to fucking kill horses.

724
00:53:34.489 --> 00:53:38.393
Jimmy's restaurant burned down
because of Michael.

725
00:53:38.426 --> 00:53:39.929
First. Michael says
it's not his problem.

726
00:53:39.962 --> 00:53:43.065
now he's threatening
to kill him for $95.000.

727
00:53:43.099 --> 00:53:45.668
- There's nothing I can do.
- Of course you can.

728
00:53:45.701 --> 00:53:47.502
he's your cousin.

729
00:53:47.536 --> 00:53:48.805
Doesn't work like that.

730
00:53:49.872 --> 00:53:51.107
I told Jimmy. you know.

731
00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.709
not to get involved
with Michael.

732
00:53:53.743 --> 00:53:55.845
And now he owes him.
There's nothing I can do.

733
00:53:55.878 --> 00:53:56.879
Okay then.

734
00:53:58.446 --> 00:54:00.616
If you're not gonna do anything.

735
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:01.818
I'll take care of it.

736
00:54:06.122 --> 00:54:07.455
What are you gonna do?

737
00:54:11.727 --> 00:54:13.328
You're gonna go to the cops?

738
00:54:16.464 --> 00:54:19.334
Just think about
what will happen.

739
00:54:25.775 --> 00:54:27.576
Exactly.

740
00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:29.145
Stay out of this.

741
00:54:29.178 --> 00:54:30.646
It's not your world.

742
00:54:36.118 --> 00:54:37.820
You're just like Michael.

743
00:54:39.822 --> 00:54:41.389
but I think you're worse.

744
00:54:42.792 --> 00:54:44.927
Because you're a fucking coward.

745
00:55:53.162 --> 00:55:54.964
The man that killed
your sister...

746
00:55:57.532 --> 00:55:58.834
I took care of him.

747
00:56:02.038 --> 00:56:04.539
It's gonna be all right now.
Come here.

748
00:56:17.687 --> 00:56:19.755
He came over in the
afternoon when I was out.

749
00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:22.959
Leonard and the kids just beat
the fucking shit out of him.

750
00:56:22.992 --> 00:56:24.126
Michael. what the fuck?

751
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.262
I can't believe this happened.

752
00:56:27.562 --> 00:56:29.231
I told you
they were fucking idiots.

753
00:56:29.265 --> 00:56:30.833
Look at the guy.
Come on. look at him.

754
00:56:30.866 --> 00:56:32.001
He looks like a lawyer.

755
00:56:32.034 --> 00:56:33.501
Eh...

756
00:56:33.535 --> 00:56:35.738
How can they not spot
the difference? Come on.

757
00:56:37.039 --> 00:56:38.607
Why do you think they sent him?

758
00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:43.545
To fix your fuck-up with the
vet. like I told you.

759
00:56:44.747 --> 00:56:45.982
- I know.
- Look at this mess.

760
00:56:46.015 --> 00:56:47.049
I know.

761
00:56:47.083 --> 00:56:48.250
Fucking idiots!

762
00:56:53.756 --> 00:56:55.191
Call the fucking doctor.
Come on.

763
00:56:55.224 --> 00:56:56.759
- I mean. I...
- No. call him right now.

764
00:56:56.792 --> 00:56:58.060
I can't let the guy out of here.

765
00:56:58.094 --> 00:56:59.729
I mean. I got
no choice about that.

766
00:56:59.762 --> 00:57:02.231
The way they did him.
I mean. he's crippled.

767
00:57:05.835 --> 00:57:07.236
Maybe the guy just disappears.

768
00:57:08.104 --> 00:57:09.205
Oh. yeah.

769
00:57:10.606 --> 00:57:12.641
So you think
they don't know they sent him?

770
00:57:13.776 --> 00:57:15.277
We say he never got here.

771
00:57:17.847 --> 00:57:18.914
No.

772
00:57:18.948 --> 00:57:20.116
You know what you're gonna do?

773
00:57:20.149 --> 00:57:22.651
You're gonna pick up the phone
and you're gonna call them

774
00:57:22.685 --> 00:57:26.322
and tell them exactly
what the fuck happened.

775
00:57:26.355 --> 00:57:28.290
And you tell them that
your guys got too excited

776
00:57:28.324 --> 00:57:29.792
when he showed up at the door.

777
00:57:29.825 --> 00:57:31.260
and they beat him up.
They'll get it.

778
00:57:32.294 --> 00:57:33.662
They'll understand.

779
00:57:35.097 --> 00:57:36.298
And then you'll tell them

780
00:57:36.332 --> 00:57:38.934
that if they want the guys
who did it.

781
00:57:38.968 --> 00:57:41.904
that you will. you know?
You will give it to them.

782
00:57:41.937 --> 00:57:43.639
And they can do whatever
the fuck it is they want.

783
00:57:43.672 --> 00:57:45.741
They can break them.
they can burn them. whatever.

784
00:57:47.209 --> 00:57:48.911
Yeah.

785
00:57:48.944 --> 00:57:50.613
It's the only choice you got.

786
00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.715
Look at this mess.

787
00:57:56.719 --> 00:57:58.054
I'll help you with it.

788
00:57:58.421 --> 00:57:59.722
All right?

789
00:57:59.755 --> 00:58:01.057
I'll help you with it.

790
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:02.591
I need a favor in return.

791
00:58:05.027 --> 00:58:06.295
Oh. yeah? What's that?

792
00:58:06.328 --> 00:58:08.597
Go easy on Jimmy
about the money.

793
00:58:08.631 --> 00:58:10.332
Jimmy. hmm?

794
00:58:10.366 --> 00:58:12.668
You've seen Jimmy
walk the streets. right?

795
00:58:13.769 --> 00:58:15.838
That means I went easy on him.

796
00:58:17.339 --> 00:58:19.008
Now he's got to come up with it.

797
00:58:19.041 --> 00:58:20.309
Man. come on.

798
00:58:20.342 --> 00:58:22.978
What happened to the restaurant
is not his fault.

799
00:58:23.012 --> 00:58:24.113
Fuck does that mean?
"His fault."

800
00:58:24.146 --> 00:58:25.247
You know what that means.
Come on. man.

801
00:58:25.281 --> 00:58:26.315
cut him some slack.

802
00:58:26.348 --> 00:58:27.683
He owes me money.

803
00:58:28.417 --> 00:58:29.618
I'll pay it.

804
00:58:30.019 --> 00:58:32.988
No. No.

805
00:58:33.022 --> 00:58:35.825
He needs to pay me back.

806
00:58:35.858 --> 00:58:37.893
and you need to mind
your own fucking business.

807
00:58:37.927 --> 00:58:39.795
All right. fine.

808
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:41.664
You deal with this shit
all by yourself.

809
00:58:48.904 --> 00:58:50.139
All right.

810
00:58:53.042 --> 00:58:54.977
Just tell Jimmy to relax.

811
00:59:21.237 --> 00:59:22.271
Jimmy!

812
01:00:03.412 --> 01:00:04.413
Jimmy.

813
01:00:05.814 --> 01:00:07.016
Jimmy?

814
01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:09.011
He ain't here?

815
01:01:12.181 --> 01:01:14.350
How come you got it so dark?

816
01:01:14.383 --> 01:01:15.918
It doesn't matter to me.

817
01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:18.287
I think you spend
too much time alone.

818
01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:25.861
You come sit down?

819
01:01:57.226 --> 01:01:59.795
They said his head
was cut halfway off.

820
01:02:04.566 --> 01:02:06.502
They found him in the trunk
of his car.

821
01:02:07.637 --> 01:02:09.838
You can't tell
your old man nothing.

822
01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.909
Never could.

823
01:02:13.942 --> 01:02:16.445
He'll sit there. just like you.
listening to somebody

824
01:02:16.478 --> 01:02:17.980
as long as they want to talk.

825
01:02:18.013 --> 01:02:20.215
then go do exactly what
he was gonna do anyway.

826
01:02:24.019 --> 01:02:25.454
You supposed to be up?

827
01:02:26.455 --> 01:02:29.124
It's 9:30. You supposed
to stay up till 9:30?

828
01:02:29.992 --> 01:02:32.561
You're lucky.

829
01:02:32.595 --> 01:02:35.632
Your Aunt Theresa don't let
Michael stay up at all.

830
01:02:35.665 --> 01:02:37.900
Right after he has done
his schoolwork.

831
01:02:37.933 --> 01:02:39.201
he's up to his room.

832
01:02:46.375 --> 01:02:48.877
Your father's got
a nice house here.

833
01:02:51.547 --> 01:02:54.216
Nice park across the street.

834
01:02:54.249 --> 01:02:56.352
Dentists live in houses
like this.

835
01:02:58.655 --> 01:03:00.222
Hey. hey.
where are you going?

836
01:03:00.255 --> 01:03:01.890
It's him.

837
01:03:01.924 --> 01:03:04.259
He don't want you running
outside this time of the night.

838
01:03:04.493 --> 01:03:06.161
Hmm?

839
01:03:09.699 --> 01:03:11.467
Yo. Where you been?

840
01:03:13.202 --> 01:03:15.404
Did you get something to eat?

841
01:03:15.437 --> 01:03:17.973
All right. go on upstairs
and let me talk to your uncle.

842
01:03:19.141 --> 01:03:21.176
You didn't hear me or what?

843
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:22.378
He's just like you.

844
01:03:23.212 --> 01:03:24.413
Doesn't listen.

845
01:03:25.682 --> 01:03:27.349
Go on.

846
01:03:27.383 --> 01:03:29.952
Don't let me catch you
sitting on the stairs listening.

847
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:41.997
Go on.

848
01:03:50.305 --> 01:03:51.641
One. two.

849
01:03:51.674 --> 01:03:53.175
Jab.

850
01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:54.243
Jab.

851
01:03:54.276 --> 01:03:55.577
One. two.

852
01:04:02.151 --> 01:04:04.052
Work. Ryan. move. move.

853
01:04:34.116 --> 01:04:36.084
- Get in.
- What's going on?

854
01:04:39.689 --> 01:04:41.156
Come on. open the trunk.

855
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:42.291
The trunk is full.

856
01:04:43.425 --> 01:04:44.993
What. you pop the lawyer?

857
01:04:45.027 --> 01:04:46.028
Get in.

858
01:05:05.214 --> 01:05:07.617
He was getting infected.
he was going delirious.

859
01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:09.786
He made so much noise I couldn't
even hang out in my own place.

860
01:05:09.819 --> 01:05:11.286
What am I supposed to do?

861
01:05:14.423 --> 01:05:17.359
There's no reason for us
to do this by ourselves. you know.

862
01:05:17.392 --> 01:05:19.629
The reason is. I want
to make sure it's done right.

863
01:05:21.163 --> 01:05:22.397
I know the place to do this.

864
01:05:22.431 --> 01:05:23.733
Oh. you know a place.

865
01:05:24.834 --> 01:05:26.034
What place?

866
01:05:28.303 --> 01:05:29.739
A place my father showed me.

867
01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:41.517
So what we're saying.
if it comes up...

868
01:05:43.285 --> 01:05:45.220
The guy was fine
when he left the house.

869
01:05:45.254 --> 01:05:46.421
That's it.

870
01:05:47.489 --> 01:05:48.457
See. there was a problem
with the way

871
01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:50.660
you wanted us to explain
to them what happened.

872
01:05:51.828 --> 01:05:53.529
The time.

873
01:05:53.562 --> 01:05:55.598
The longer it goes.
the worse it gets.

874
01:05:56.799 --> 01:05:57.767
The afternoon
when you came over.

875
01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.135
there's already been a day.
a day and a half.

876
01:06:00.168 --> 01:06:02.404
If I turn him over then.

877
01:06:02.437 --> 01:06:06.208
it looks like I decided
to do one thing and got scared.

878
01:06:06.241 --> 01:06:07.576
tried to do something else.

879
01:06:08.443 --> 01:06:10.078
It makes us look weak.

880
01:07:43.405 --> 01:07:45.742
I think you've
used this hole before.

881
01:07:45.775 --> 01:07:48.645
All of a sudden. I'm digging up
bones and shit like that.

882
01:07:58.353 --> 01:07:59.521
That's deep enough.

883
01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:01.824
Get out of there.

884
01:08:08.965 --> 01:08:10.399
It's deep enough.

885
01:08:12.735 --> 01:08:14.536
You know what
I was thinking?

886
01:08:15.605 --> 01:08:19.241
Maybe we give that kid
at the gym to the Italians.

887
01:08:19.274 --> 01:08:21.576
I'm sure they could make
a shit-ton of money with him.

888
01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.348
Maybe it'll make them
forget about all this.

889
01:08:28.918 --> 01:08:30.820
Peter? What do you think?

890
01:08:58.313 --> 01:08:59.649
You're on your own now.

891
01:09:40.056 --> 01:09:43.926
Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming.

892
01:10:04.013 --> 01:10:05.380
Thanks.

893
01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:10.452
Hey!

894
01:10:14.056 --> 01:10:15.725
I wanted to thank you

895
01:10:17.827 --> 01:10:19.461
for taking care for everything.

896
01:10:19.494 --> 01:10:20.797
Yeah. don't say that.

897
01:10:26.969 --> 01:10:28.604
Since you've called.

898
01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.608
nothing feels real.

899
01:10:38.748 --> 01:10:40.315
So what are you gonna do?

900
01:10:43.418 --> 01:10:45.755
I don't really know. I...

901
01:10:45.788 --> 01:10:47.522
I don't think
I want to stay here.

902
01:10:47.556 --> 01:10:49.826
It's his city. you know.

903
01:10:49.859 --> 01:10:51.326
I see him everywhere.

904
01:10:52.962 --> 01:10:54.429
Maybe Florida.

905
01:11:01.536 --> 01:11:03.405
All right then. Take care.

906
01:11:05.675 --> 01:11:07.043
Are you going somewhere?

907
01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.148
<i>What are you gonna do now?</i>

908
01:11:12.181 --> 01:11:13.950
I don't know.

909
01:11:16.886 --> 01:11:18.054
I don't know.

910
01:11:27.462 --> 01:11:29.364
You should come visit me
in Florida.

911
01:11:40.009 --> 01:11:41.911
Yeah. I can do that.

912
01:11:44.981 --> 01:11:46.582
I can do that.

913
01:11:52.688 --> 01:11:54.489
So this is your parents' place?

914
01:11:55.825 --> 01:11:56.993
Yeah.

915
01:12:00.897 --> 01:12:03.799
I used to live here till my...
Till my sister died.

916
01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:05.668
Then I moved to Michael's place.

917
01:12:08.671 --> 01:12:10.106
What about your parents?

918
01:12:16.646 --> 01:12:20.182
My mom had a breakdown.
and my dad was killed.

919
01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:32.895
Jimmy told me about your sister
but not about your parents.

920
01:12:40.703 --> 01:12:42.605
If it's so painful.
why did you come back?

921
01:12:45.675 --> 01:12:48.543
Well. it's my home. you know.

922
01:12:49.111 --> 01:12:50.578
I belong here.

923
01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:58.120
When my parents died.
I tried to live in their house.

924
01:12:59.889 --> 01:13:01.057
but I couldn't.

925
01:13:04.126 --> 01:13:05.962
That's why I came here.

926
01:13:07.196 --> 01:13:08.698
For a fresh start.

927
01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.101
Go back to school.

928
01:13:16.872 --> 01:13:18.573
and be close to my brother.

929
01:13:21.043 --> 01:13:22.510
And take care of him.

930
01:13:31.887 --> 01:13:33.488
When you found him.

931
01:13:34.957 --> 01:13:36.524
what did you think?

932
01:13:48.904 --> 01:13:50.239
I thought...

933
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:56.578
I thought. "Fuck. I'm late.

934
01:14:00.216 --> 01:14:02.084
"I'm too fucking late."

935
01:16:05.908 --> 01:16:07.209
See you. guys.

936
01:16:30.833 --> 01:16:32.101
What are you doing here?

937
01:16:33.936 --> 01:16:35.070
Carlos!

938
01:16:35.104 --> 01:16:36.972
Michael. what are
you doing here?

939
01:16:37.006 --> 01:16:38.274
Carlos.

940
01:16:41.076 --> 01:16:42.411
Carlos.

941
01:16:43.512 --> 01:16:44.947
No sparring today.

942
01:16:45.881 --> 01:16:48.884
I brought this guy over here.
Get ready.

943
01:16:48.918 --> 01:16:51.020
He actually used
to be a real fighter.

944
01:16:51.053 --> 01:16:54.256
And I want to see him
move around with your kid.

945
01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:56.258
This ain't the place
for somebody like that.

946
01:16:56.292 --> 01:16:58.194
Listen to me. Carlos.

947
01:16:58.227 --> 01:16:59.895
I saw your kid move around
the other day.

948
01:16:59.929 --> 01:17:01.063
and I thought it
was really impressive.

949
01:17:01.096 --> 01:17:03.199
Now I want to see him move
around with a real fighter.

950
01:17:03.232 --> 01:17:04.500
That's why I brought
this guy in here.

951
01:17:04.533 --> 01:17:06.670
- Michael. stop it.
- Am I talking to you?

952
01:17:09.071 --> 01:17:10.239
I didn't think so.

953
01:17:12.007 --> 01:17:13.209
This is my gym.

954
01:17:13.242 --> 01:17:14.944
I know it's your fucking gym.

955
01:17:14.977 --> 01:17:16.245
And that's why I brought
a fighter in here

956
01:17:16.278 --> 01:17:18.047
so he can move around
with your kid.

957
01:17:19.215 --> 01:17:21.217
Carlos look at me.
Look at me!

958
01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:26.055
I'm asking you for
a favor here. You understand?

959
01:17:26.088 --> 01:17:28.290
And I think you want
to fucking give me that favor.

960
01:17:28.324 --> 01:17:29.858
- do you understand?
- You fuck!

961
01:17:29.892 --> 01:17:32.061
Carlos. come on!
Stop it! Stop it!

962
01:17:32.094 --> 01:17:33.128
Stop it!

963
01:17:33.462 --> 01:17:34.496
Stop it!

964
01:17:34.530 --> 01:17:36.398
- Hey. Lenny... Lenny.
- Stop it!

965
01:17:36.432 --> 01:17:38.300
Put the fucking gun down!

966
01:17:44.406 --> 01:17:45.841
Hey. Carlos...

967
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:49.311
I'll see you around.

968
01:17:51.146 --> 01:17:52.381
And. Ryan...

969
01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:55.951
I'll see you around. too.

970
01:18:00.556 --> 01:18:01.957
Peter. you comin'?

971
01:18:09.098 --> 01:18:10.432
Get out of my gym!

972
01:18:37.893 --> 01:18:39.028
Hey.

973
01:18:41.063 --> 01:18:42.097
Uh...

974
01:18:47.069 --> 01:18:48.103
Look. uh...

975
01:18:49.305 --> 01:18:51.840
It's not gonna be easy. I know.

976
01:18:53.309 --> 01:18:55.144
Something bad
happened to your father.

977
01:19:00.983 --> 01:19:02.051
Don't worry.

978
01:19:03.919 --> 01:19:05.087
We're family.

979
01:19:06.322 --> 01:19:07.523
You're gonna move with us.

980
01:19:08.991 --> 01:19:12.094
With Aunt Theresa.
Cousin Michael...

981
01:19:16.666 --> 01:19:19.368
Uh...

982
01:19:20.903 --> 01:19:22.371
You won't be alone anymore.

983
01:19:24.173 --> 01:19:25.240
I'll look after you.

984
01:19:28.944 --> 01:19:30.245
You're like my own son now.

985
01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:38.354
Get your stuff.
I'll wait for you downstairs.

986
01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:30.139
We do them in the morning.

987
01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:36.613
See. you know what I wish?
I wish there was a moment

988
01:20:36.646 --> 01:20:40.983
where what's gonna happen

989
01:20:41.016 --> 01:20:42.985
is right there with
what already happened.

990
01:20:43.018 --> 01:20:46.088
So Carlos can see it.
the cause and the effect.

991
01:20:47.757 --> 01:20:49.057
How do I do that?

992
01:20:50.993 --> 01:20:53.663
What I really want is

993
01:20:53.696 --> 01:20:55.698
that we kill him
more than once. but...

994
01:21:01.069 --> 01:21:03.105
We park a car in front of
his garage door in the morning.

995
01:21:03.138 --> 01:21:05.407
so when the kid gets out
of the car to open the door.

996
01:21:05.441 --> 01:21:08.076
then bam. bam. we do him
right there on the sidewalk.

997
01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:10.312
in front of Carlos.

998
01:21:10.345 --> 01:21:13.616
You got to make sure that
he sees it before you do him.

999
01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:16.151
I don't really care who does who.

1000
01:21:16.185 --> 01:21:18.353
But you got to do the kid first.

1001
01:21:18.387 --> 01:21:19.521
So Carlos sees it.

1002
01:21:36.205 --> 01:21:38.106
Are you gonna try
and talk me out of this?

1003
01:21:39.609 --> 01:21:41.443
Hmm?

1004
01:21:41.477 --> 01:21:43.545
No. there's not much more
to talk about. right?

1005
01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:51.053
Hey. you know.
I was just thinking

1006
01:21:51.086 --> 01:21:53.021
maybe it's better
if you do Carlos yourself.

1007
01:21:53.055 --> 01:21:55.123
you know.
just to keep it in the family.
