For what it's worth. I see it
that they were trying to

make progress on this
within government.

161
00:08:04.656 --> 00:08:06.693

far as they could.

162
00:08:06.727 --> 00:08:07.935
and then they realized that.

163
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.352

to move it further forward

164
00:08:11.387 --> 00:08:14.321

it to The New York Times
and all that.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.873
that this was all orchestrated
and not at all true.

176
00:08:48.907 --> 00:08:51.427
I think that this
was definitely something

177
00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:56.328
that was organized.
thought out long-term.

178
00:08:56.363 --> 00:08:57.778
Again. I think some...

179
00:08:57.813 --> 00:08:59.642
I think they know.
and they're trying to
get ahead of something.

180
00:08:59.677 --> 00:09:03.646
I think... I use the analogy
of a snowball at the top
of a hill.

181
00:09:03.681 --> 00:09:05.234
and it starts out really small.

182
00:09:05.268 --> 00:09:07.236
And as it rolls down.
it's going to get bigger
and bigger.

183
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.134
and I think they're trying
to get ahead of that.

184
00:09:09.169 --> 00:09:12.655
You can't talk about
this subject with
a government background

185
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.381
without being the bad guy.

186
00:09:14.415 --> 00:09:16.728
in some people's minds eye.

187
00:09:16.763 --> 00:09:18.799
It just comes
with the territory.

188
00:09:18.834 --> 00:09:20.663
I refuse to discuss
anything classified.

189
00:09:20.698 --> 00:09:23.563
I've took an oath.
which is. by the way.
a lifelong oath.

190
00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:26.048
As I've told people before.

191
00:09:26.082 --> 00:09:27.670
don't ask me because
I'm not going to tell you.

192
00:09:27.705 --> 00:09:28.844
Lue is in a tough spot.

193
00:09:28.878 --> 00:09:30.639
because he knows
a lot of things that...

194
00:09:30.673 --> 00:09:32.813
I mean. he still...
He was...

195
00:09:32.848 --> 00:09:34.884
He came out of
the Intelligence community

196
00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:36.506
and he probably still.

197
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.648
undoubtedly still has
connections to the
Intelligence community.

198
00:09:39.682 --> 00:09:44.549
Well. you know. so he can't
say everything he knows

199
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:45.688
and has been privy to.

200
00:09:45.723 --> 00:09:47.863
These people promoting this...

201
00:09:48.726 --> 00:09:51.211
agenda of UFO openness.

202
00:09:51.245 --> 00:09:53.523
not disclosure. but openness.

203
00:09:53.558 --> 00:09:56.699
they have enemies
within that establishment.

204
00:09:56.734 --> 00:09:58.943
So we're not talking
about a unified message.

205
00:09:58.977 --> 00:10:00.600
It's very uncomfortable.

206
00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:02.981
Especially if you've
lived a life

207
00:10:03.016 --> 00:10:06.122
where anonymity
has been your friend.

208
00:10:06.157 --> 00:10:10.782
We have every right
to know the truth.

209
00:10:10.817 --> 00:10:15.235
And it's... It's not okay
that they're holding that back.

210
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:18.548
It is not
a fun place to be.

211
00:10:18.583 --> 00:10:20.999
In fact.
if I had any opportunity

212
00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:23.795
for anybody else to stand up
and take my place...

213
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:25.452
I would do it.

214
00:10:25.486 --> 00:10:28.628
There are a lot of people
that want this information out

215
00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:31.458
and there are a lot of people
who don't want
this information out.

216
00:10:31.492 --> 00:10:33.805
The level of pushback that

217
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.359
Harry Reid shared
with me on camera.

218
00:10:36.394 --> 00:10:39.949
When he tried to launch
this investigatory arm

219
00:10:39.984 --> 00:10:41.537
into creating AATIP.

220
00:10:41.571 --> 00:10:44.298
he said he got so much pushback
from the intelligence agencies.

221
00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:46.473
that they. like.
tried to destroy people.

222
00:10:46.507 --> 00:10:49.510
They really did not
want this to happen.

223
00:10:52.203 --> 00:10:54.136
NARRATOR:
After the initial media flurry.

224
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.620
the Pentagon promised a report

225
00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.450
that might shed some light
on the subject.

226
00:10:58.485 --> 00:11:01.971
JAKE TAPPER:
Do you expect to see
real answers in this report?

227
00:11:02.006 --> 00:11:03.455
What do you think?

228
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.907
Look. Honestly.
I don't think so. Jake.

229
00:11:06.942 --> 00:11:08.115
NARRATOR:
The public only received

230
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.808
a few pages of
inconclusive information.

231
00:11:10.842 --> 00:11:15.053
A more elaborate report
was delivered to Congress
behind closed doors.

232
00:11:15.088 --> 00:11:17.262
Freedom of
Information Act requests.

233
00:11:17.297 --> 00:11:19.955
known as FOIA requests.
were submitted.

234
00:11:19.989 --> 00:11:22.958
The responses received
were heavily redacted.

235
00:11:22.992 --> 00:11:25.201
Three years later.
three and a half years later.

236
00:11:25.236 --> 00:11:28.480
no new evidence has come out.

237
00:11:28.515 --> 00:11:30.620
We've got no new videos.

238
00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:32.277
Nothing like that happened.

239
00:11:32.312 --> 00:11:33.796
NARRATOR:
Congressman Tim Burchett

240
00:11:33.831 --> 00:11:37.351
has become
an outspoken crusader
against the secrecy.

241
00:11:37.386 --> 00:11:41.321
The American public
deserves to know.
We need transparency.

242
00:11:41.355 --> 00:11:43.185
That's why nobody
trusts government.

243
00:11:43.219 --> 00:11:47.810
Nobody trusts either party
when it comes down to it.

244
00:11:47.845 --> 00:11:49.225
NARRATOR:
Instead of new answers.

245
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.503
we've been given
a whitewashing of the past

246
00:11:51.538 --> 00:11:54.679
and further reinforcement
of a "New Narrative"

247
00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.198
created to fit the day.

248
00:12:02.066 --> 00:12:03.653
NARRATOR:
The New Narrative states that

249
00:12:03.688 --> 00:12:07.485
the UAP's not ours
or any foreign government's.

250
00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:10.660
They display characteristics
that defy explanation.

251
00:12:10.695 --> 00:12:13.180
"We are committed
to determining their nature.

252
00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:15.251
"and assessing
any potential threat."

253
00:12:15.286 --> 00:12:18.254
There was no official
government study of the topic

254
00:12:18.289 --> 00:12:21.395
after Project Blue Book
ended in 1969.

255
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.123
until the AAWSAP program
started in 2004.

256
00:12:25.158 --> 00:12:27.574
By sort of extracting
a lot of the history out.

257
00:12:29.127 --> 00:12:30.715
they're able
to make it seem like.

258
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.062
wow. this is
a real mystery here.

259
00:12:33.097 --> 00:12:34.546
So. I don't agree with that.

260
00:12:34.581 --> 00:12:38.378
I think their New Narrative.
I think they have this fear.

261
00:12:38.412 --> 00:12:40.104
you know. that it's a threat.

262
00:12:40.138 --> 00:12:43.901
And the word "threat"
kind of bothers me a little bit.

263
00:12:43.935 --> 00:12:48.422
But I understand that in order
to get government attention.

264
00:12:48.457 --> 00:12:50.977
they need to call it.
perhaps. a threat.

265
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:53.669
So we have an
ongoing situation here.

266
00:12:53.703 --> 00:12:55.567
This is a defense issue.

267
00:12:55.602 --> 00:12:56.948
It's an air safety issue.

268
00:12:56.983 --> 00:12:59.468
It's a national security issue.

269
00:12:59.502 --> 00:13:00.572
It's a valid issue.

270
00:13:00.607 --> 00:13:03.368
There is something
flying around in our airspace

271
00:13:03.403 --> 00:13:06.751
and we don't know what it is
or we're not telling what it is.

272
00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.132
Eighteen months ago.

273
00:13:08.166 --> 00:13:13.033
if you had asked anyone
in government the official line
on UFOs.

274
00:13:13.068 --> 00:13:16.002
you would have received
a standard response

275
00:13:16.036 --> 00:13:17.727
rather like this.

276
00:13:17.762 --> 00:13:21.559
"There is no current interest
or involvement in the subject.

277
00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:24.976
"Since the termination
of Blue Book in 1969.

278
00:13:25.011 --> 00:13:26.115
"nobody in government

279
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.393
"is researching
or investigating this."

280
00:13:28.428 --> 00:13:29.739
You know.
the department writ large

281
00:13:29.774 --> 00:13:33.226
is clearly not interested
in UFOs whatsoever.

282
00:13:35.642 --> 00:13:38.265
NARRATOR: This story leaves
a gap of over 35 years

283
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.784
that the government
was supposedly

284
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.787
not engaged in the study
of the phenomenon.

285
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.928
The media was quick
to participate
in the new story.

286
00:13:45.963 --> 00:13:49.725
Were they complicit
in delivering this
new version of the facts?

287
00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:55.179
There is a risk of believing
the official narrative

288
00:13:55.213 --> 00:13:57.871
too quickly
and just reporting it.

289
00:13:57.906 --> 00:14:02.358
There's many steps to go
and it's going to take a while.

290
00:14:02.393 --> 00:14:04.705
And. you know. they still have
a totally compliant media.

291
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.983
for the most part.

292
00:14:06.017 --> 00:14:09.089
I can tell you from my knowledge
of The New York Times.

293
00:14:09.124 --> 00:14:11.816
The New York Times
is not afraid to
confront the government.

294
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.232
Having been legal counsel
for The New York Times

295
00:14:14.267 --> 00:14:15.924
and for NBC News.

296
00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:19.824
the people on the board
of editors of those things.

297
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:24.415
you know. feel themselves to
have a certain patriotic duty.
as they perceive them.

298
00:14:25.554 --> 00:14:29.040
to not reveal anything
to the American public

299
00:14:29.075 --> 00:14:32.733
that the National Security State
people don't want revealed.

300
00:14:32.768 --> 00:14:33.838
So I don't want to be bound

301
00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:36.047
[CHUCKLES] by what
Danny Sheehan said about his.

302
00:14:36.082 --> 00:14:39.706
you know. concepts of what
The Timesprints and doesn't.

303
00:14:42.122 --> 00:14:45.470
NARRATOR: This New Narrative
has become the official story.

304
00:14:45.505 --> 00:14:48.404
It was even stated as fact
by Andre Carson

305
00:14:48.439 --> 00:14:52.132
at the beginning of the first
congressional UFO hearings.

306
00:14:52.167 --> 00:14:53.996
in over 40 years.

307
00:14:54.031 --> 00:14:56.136
More than 50 years ago.

308
00:14:56.171 --> 00:14:59.899
the U.S. Government
ended Project Blue Book.

309
00:14:59.933 --> 00:15:02.522
An effort to catalog
and understand

310
00:15:02.556 --> 00:15:04.662
sightings of objects in the air

311
00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.699
that could not otherwise
be explained.

312
00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:09.701
For more than 20 years.
that project

313
00:15:09.736 --> 00:15:12.912
had treated unidentified
anomalies in our airspace

314
00:15:12.946 --> 00:15:17.986
as a national security threat
to be monitored
and investigated.

315
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.161
In 2017. we learned
for the first time that
the Department of Defense

316
00:15:21.196 --> 00:15:23.992
had quietly restarted
a similar organization.

317
00:15:24.026 --> 00:15:27.857
tracking what we now call
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

318
00:15:30.515 --> 00:15:32.138
NARRATOR:
We've heard all of this before.

319
00:15:32.172 --> 00:15:36.797
The New Narrative
is really an eerie echo
of 70-year-old events.

320
00:15:36.832 --> 00:15:41.837
We can say that
the recent sightings
are in no way connected

321
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:46.393
with any secret development
by any agency
of the United States.

322
00:15:46.428 --> 00:15:49.845
Aircraft. we call them aircraft.
are displaying characteristics

323
00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:52.710
that are not currently
within the U.S. inventory.

324
00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:56.472
nor in any foreign inventory
that we are aware of.

325
00:15:56.507 --> 00:15:59.406
Air Force interest
in this problem

326
00:15:59.441 --> 00:16:01.891
has been due to our
feeling of an obligation

327
00:16:01.926 --> 00:16:06.966
to identify and analyze.
to the best of our ability.

328
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.728
anything in the air
that may have the possibility

329
00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:14.352
of threat or menace
to the United States.

330
00:16:14.387 --> 00:16:18.080
We know that our service members
have encountered

331
00:16:18.115 --> 00:16:20.255
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

332
00:16:20.289 --> 00:16:21.911
And because UAPs pose

333
00:16:21.946 --> 00:16:24.845
potential flight safety
and general security risk.

334
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.159
we are committed
to a focused effort
to determine their origins.

335
00:16:28.194 --> 00:16:32.474
However. there have been
a certain percentage
of this volume of reports

336
00:16:33.613 --> 00:16:37.099
that have been made
by credible observers

337
00:16:37.134 --> 00:16:39.343
of relatively incredible things.

338
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.794
It is this group of observations

339
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:46.419
that we now
are attempting to resolve.

340
00:16:46.453 --> 00:16:50.733
There will be a recognized
concerted effort

341
00:16:50.768 --> 00:16:52.528
to figure this out.

342
00:16:52.563 --> 00:16:56.670
NARRATOR: The old story
was repeated almost verbatim
by the current players.

343
00:16:56.705 --> 00:16:59.397
We're still far
from the goal line.

344
00:16:59.432 --> 00:17:02.504
and there is a lot of positions

345
00:17:02.538 --> 00:17:04.022
that they could
take along the way

346
00:17:04.057 --> 00:17:06.680
that still will allow them
to maintain credibility

347
00:17:07.336 --> 00:17:10.477
and avoid culpability.

348
00:17:10.512 --> 00:17:12.340
The media and
the public want more.

349
00:17:12.376 --> 00:17:13.825
They want answers.

350
00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:15.689
I'm not sure that
there are going to be
easy answers to this.

351
00:17:15.723 --> 00:17:20.867
They're trying to sweep anything
prior to 2004 under the carpet.

352
00:17:20.901 --> 00:17:22.558
but we won't let them
because we've got

353
00:17:22.593 --> 00:17:25.215
all the historical cases
and those can't go away.

354
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:29.048
They're not only
whitewashing history.
they're denying it.

355
00:17:29.082 --> 00:17:32.568
They're only acknowledging
the phenomenon back to 2004.

356
00:17:32.603 --> 00:17:34.984
The government has
a lot to answer for.

357
00:17:35.019 --> 00:17:35.916
Absolutely right.

358
00:17:36.883 --> 00:17:38.885
The history of the subject
has been replete

359
00:17:38.919 --> 00:17:41.577
with misinformation
and disinformation.

360
00:17:41.612 --> 00:17:43.338
It's just a complete cover up.

361
00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:53.037
NARRATOR: What was going on
in the time between the closing
of Project Blue Book

362
00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:56.627
and the beginning of
the officially announced
UFO programs

363
00:17:56.661 --> 00:17:58.525
that we know about today?

364
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.044
Why is it important?

365
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:03.220
Because in those years.
is where the truth lies.

366
00:18:03.254 --> 00:18:08.604
A truth that many have gone
to great lengths to conceal.
deny. and debunk.

367
00:18:08.639 --> 00:18:10.606
We start by taking
a closer look

368
00:18:10.641 --> 00:18:14.369
at the period between
1947 and 2005.

369
00:18:14.403 --> 00:18:16.957
The existence
of official UFO research

370
00:18:16.992 --> 00:18:20.444
and programs by
the U.S. Government
in this time frame

371
00:18:20.478 --> 00:18:22.446
has been staunchly denied.

372
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.207
The facts challenge
that position.

373
00:18:25.242 --> 00:18:29.556
In the late 1940s.
the world was recovering
from World War II.

374
00:18:29.591 --> 00:18:31.662
The military was reorganizing.

375
00:18:31.696 --> 00:18:35.148
In 1947. the Air Force
was being created

376
00:18:35.183 --> 00:18:37.426
as a standalone branch
of service.

377
00:18:37.461 --> 00:18:40.809
The Cold War
and its strategic questions
were looming.

378
00:18:40.843 --> 00:18:42.776
But in the midst
of all of this.

379
00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:45.262
the United States Army
created what they called

380
00:18:45.296 --> 00:18:47.643
the Interplanetary
Phenomenon Unit

381
00:18:47.678 --> 00:18:50.474
of the Scientific
and Technical branch.

382
00:18:50.508 --> 00:18:52.752
Why did they need that?

383
00:18:54.547 --> 00:18:58.965
Numerous FOIA request
verified the existence
of this Army program.

384
00:18:58.999 --> 00:19:01.105
They state that
the unit disbanded

385
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.246
and was folded into
Project Blue Book in the 50s.

386
00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:05.868
But the files of this group

387
00:19:05.903 --> 00:19:09.251
are not part of the official
Project Blue Book Collection.

388
00:19:09.286 --> 00:19:11.184
So where did they go?

389
00:19:11.219 --> 00:19:14.946
During that time.
there was advanced technology
in the possession of Germany.

390
00:19:14.981 --> 00:19:18.571
Scientists were brought over
after the war to continue
the work.

391
00:19:18.605 --> 00:19:22.022
Stories of UFOs and
crashes were abundant.

392
00:19:22.057 --> 00:19:26.268
including the famous
Roswell incident of 1947.

393
00:19:26.303 --> 00:19:28.339
The late astronaut
Dr. Edgar Mitchell

394
00:19:28.374 --> 00:19:31.687
was given secret information
about events of the time.

395
00:19:31.722 --> 00:19:34.069
In this
never before seen video.

396
00:19:34.103 --> 00:19:36.071
he shares what he was told.

397
00:19:36.105 --> 00:19:38.004
Individuals at the Pentagon.

398
00:19:38.038 --> 00:19:41.456
had been attempting
to get into the system

399
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:42.940
and find out about it.

400
00:19:43.872 --> 00:19:47.151
thus confirming
and had confirmed.

401
00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.773
that the Roswell incident
was real.

402
00:19:48.808 --> 00:19:53.951
They saw some of the material
from the crashed spacecraft.

403
00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:59.301
Some saw bodies from the beings
that were killed in that crash.

404
00:19:59.336 --> 00:20:02.373
There were some
that saw a live being.

405
00:20:02.408 --> 00:20:07.447
A live being had been
taken away and was
in the system somewhere.

406
00:20:07.482 --> 00:20:11.900
So those were
real life incidents that
were reported to me.

407
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:18.838
NARRATOR: Many believe
in the formation of a group
called Majestic 12

408
00:20:18.872 --> 00:20:20.736
assembled by President Truman.

409
00:20:20.771 --> 00:20:23.705
to strategize about how
to handle the information

410
00:20:23.739 --> 00:20:25.845
about these encounters
and more.

411
00:20:25.879 --> 00:20:28.088
Documents purport
to detail the creation

412
00:20:28.123 --> 00:20:31.299
and deployment of this group.
but their authenticity

413
00:20:31.333 --> 00:20:33.646
is still a hotly debated topic.

414
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.063
It makes sense. however.
that under such circumstances.

415
00:20:37.097 --> 00:20:39.652
just such a group
would have been formed.

416
00:20:39.686 --> 00:20:41.585
They would have had
control of the subject

417
00:20:41.619 --> 00:20:43.863
and accountability
to a select few.

418
00:20:43.897 --> 00:20:46.521
If a decision was made
to enact secrecy.

419
00:20:46.555 --> 00:20:48.833
this group would have
made it happen.

420
00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:57.290
After years of UFO hysteria
and speculation between
1947 and 1952.

421
00:20:57.325 --> 00:21:01.467
the government finally said
that they were taking
the subject seriously.

422
00:21:01.501 --> 00:21:02.709
Enter Project Blue Book.

423
00:21:02.744 --> 00:21:04.021
a public program

424
00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:07.093
that was supposed to
shed light on the UFO subject.

425
00:21:07.127 --> 00:21:11.822
Paul Hynek.
son of the late J. Allen Hynek.
shared this.

426
00:21:11.856 --> 00:21:14.445
My father was the
chief scientific consultant

427
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.138
working alongside
Air Force counterparts.

428
00:21:18.173 --> 00:21:22.108
And it became clear that
the role of Project Blue Book

429
00:21:22.142 --> 00:21:27.734
wasn't to look for the truth.
but was to manufacture answers

430
00:21:27.769 --> 00:21:29.633
and to tamp down hysteria.

431
00:21:29.667 --> 00:21:36.225
Somebody called it the
Society for the Explanation
of the Uninvestigated.

432
00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.885
My father had to question
whether he should
stay involved.

433
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.267
James McDonald.
one of his colleagues. said.

434
00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:47.029
look. you're being played
a fool by the Air Force.

435
00:21:47.064 --> 00:21:48.652
and my father
thought a lot about it.

436
00:21:48.686 --> 00:21:50.274
He finally decided that

437
00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:54.036
having that
front row center seat
to all these goings on

438
00:21:54.071 --> 00:21:56.832
and being able to
influence things. not control.

439
00:21:56.867 --> 00:21:58.386
was worth the trouble.

440
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:04.530
But it became increasingly
frustrating for him over time.

441
00:22:04.564 --> 00:22:08.085
as he saw that the Air Force
was not changing their colors.

442
00:22:10.743 --> 00:22:13.124
NARRATOR: J. Allen Hynek
was openly frustrated

443
00:22:13.159 --> 00:22:15.126
by the fact he was
never given access

444
00:22:15.161 --> 00:22:18.785
to what he knew were compelling
events shrouded in secrecy.

445
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.237
It haunted him
until his passing in 1986.

446
00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:26.068
Official Air Force statements
regarding the conclusion
of Blue Book say.

447
00:22:26.103 --> 00:22:28.312
"Since the termination
of Project Blue Book.

448
00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:30.418
"nothing has occurred
that would support

449
00:22:30.452 --> 00:22:34.042
"a resumption of
UFO investigations
by the Air Force."

450
00:22:34.076 --> 00:22:37.286
But another four-year request
revealed a different story.

451
00:22:37.321 --> 00:22:40.738
A 1969 memo from
General Carroll Bolender.

452
00:22:40.773 --> 00:22:43.707
a senior director at Air Force
Research and Development.

453
00:22:43.741 --> 00:22:46.365
stated. "After Blue Book
was dissolved.

454
00:22:46.399 --> 00:22:47.711
"that reports of 'UFOs'

455
00:22:47.745 --> 00:22:49.747
"would still continue
to be handled

456
00:22:49.782 --> 00:22:51.646
"through a standard
Air Force procedure

457
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.199
"designed for this purpose.

458
00:22:53.233 --> 00:22:56.202
"Furthermore. reports of
unidentified flying objects

459
00:22:56.236 --> 00:22:59.205
"which could affect
national security were. are.

460
00:22:59.239 --> 00:23:01.518
"not part of the
Blue Book system."

461
00:23:01.552 --> 00:23:05.625
There was the creation
of the Air Intelligence
Service squadrons.

462
00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.457
which were tasked
with going to any spot

463
00:23:09.491 --> 00:23:11.251
in the continental
United States.

464
00:23:11.286 --> 00:23:15.911
within six hours
and picking up debris.

465
00:23:15.946 --> 00:23:21.814
fallen pilots. and also
containing information leak.

466
00:23:21.848 --> 00:23:24.506
And so many people think
that that would have been

467
00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:28.476
the entity or the agency
that gave birth to
the Men in Black.

468
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.687
What seems to be clear
is that there was a bifurcation.

469
00:23:32.721 --> 00:23:34.413
That Project Blue Book
may have started off

470
00:23:34.447 --> 00:23:35.759
as a serious
scientific endeavor.

471
00:23:35.793 --> 00:23:38.451
but as of 1953.
it no longer was.

472
00:23:38.486 --> 00:23:42.248
and there was most likely
the Air Intelligence
Service squadrons

473
00:23:42.282 --> 00:23:43.870
that picked up the banner

474
00:23:43.905 --> 00:23:46.632
of going out and
trying to find saucers

475
00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:49.220
and then hand them off to people

476
00:23:49.255 --> 00:23:51.084
who would try
to reverse-engineer

477
00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:52.983
the propulsion systems.
et cetera.

478
00:23:53.017 --> 00:23:54.812
DON SCHMITT:
General Arthur Exon
described to us

479
00:23:54.847 --> 00:23:56.435
when he was base commander

480
00:23:56.469 --> 00:23:59.714
at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base in 1964.

481
00:23:59.748 --> 00:24:02.406
that there would be
an ongoing joke

482
00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:05.478
that the Blue Book. you know.
a two-man team would fly off

483
00:24:05.513 --> 00:24:08.170
in a little single engine plane
in one direction.

484
00:24:08.205 --> 00:24:11.484
and then the actual project
would arrive from Washington

485
00:24:11.519 --> 00:24:14.970
on a commercial flight.
they would change back
into their uniforms.

486
00:24:15.005 --> 00:24:19.458
and a team of 12-15 officers
would fly off in a jet

487
00:24:19.492 --> 00:24:22.909
to actually conduct
full-scale investigations.

488
00:24:25.325 --> 00:24:27.086
NARRATOR:
Project Blue Book
was headquartered

489
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.088
at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base.

490
00:24:29.122 --> 00:24:32.125
but some of the other.
more secret UFO programs

491
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.196
seem to have been
located there. too.

492
00:24:34.231 --> 00:24:37.165
One of these is
the mysterious Blue Room.

493
00:24:37.199 --> 00:24:41.341
an underground repository
of recovered technology
and debris.

494
00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:45.345
MICHAEL: This is the location.
allegedly. where they
brought the bodies

495
00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.002
and the craft from
the Roswell crash

496
00:24:47.037 --> 00:24:50.419
and where all of the other
crash retrievals and bodies.

497
00:24:50.454 --> 00:24:53.630
kind of like they have
a consortium of where
they keep all this.

498
00:24:53.664 --> 00:24:57.910
So you've got the bodies.
you've got the craft.
you've got the debris.

499
00:24:57.944 --> 00:24:59.290
autopsy reports.

500
00:24:59.325 --> 00:25:02.535
the eight-by-ten glossy
black and white photographs.

501
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:06.263
and the gun camera footage
is all supposed to be kept

502
00:25:06.297 --> 00:25:09.266
at the Blue Room.
some type of
an underground vault

503
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.201
or Building 18 at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

504
00:25:13.235 --> 00:25:16.791
NARRATOR:
Senator Barry Goldwater
sought confirmation of this.

505
00:25:16.825 --> 00:25:18.827
At Wright-Patterson field.

506
00:25:18.862 --> 00:25:21.520
if you could get
into certain places.

507
00:25:21.554 --> 00:25:23.314
you find out what the Air Force

508
00:25:23.349 --> 00:25:26.145
and the government knows
about UFOs.

509
00:25:26.179 --> 00:25:31.150
Reportedly. a spaceship landed

510
00:25:31.184 --> 00:25:35.085
and it was all hushed up.
quiet. and nobody ever...

511
00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:37.294
I've never heard
about much of it.

512
00:25:38.398 --> 00:25:42.817
I called Curtis LeMay.
and I said. "General.

513
00:25:42.851 --> 00:25:47.097
"I know we have a room
at Wright-Patterson.

514
00:25:47.131 --> 00:25:49.340
"where you put
all the secret stuff.

515
00:25:51.066 --> 00:25:52.274
"Could I go in there?"

516
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:56.175
I've never heard him get mad.

517
00:25:56.209 --> 00:25:58.591
but he got madder
than hell at me.

518
00:25:58.626 --> 00:25:59.868
Cussed me out.

519
00:25:59.903 --> 00:26:02.802
said. "Don't ever
ask me that question."

520
00:26:02.837 --> 00:26:06.323
NARRATOR: Supposedly.
the contents of the
Blue Room were filmed.

521
00:26:06.357 --> 00:26:10.154
Exhaustive FOIA requests
finally revealed that this film

522
00:26:10.189 --> 00:26:13.054
did indeed exist.
but was destroyed.

523
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:19.267
Nick Pope. a longtime
ex-British government pundit
on the topic.

524
00:26:19.301 --> 00:26:22.511
denied official investigation
of the subject for years.

525
00:26:22.546 --> 00:26:23.754
Until he didn't.

526
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:26.723
The more interesting
UFO sightings are
being looked at.

527
00:26:26.757 --> 00:26:29.415
but not under the auspices

528
00:26:29.449 --> 00:26:32.798
of a formally constituted
UFO research program.

529
00:26:32.832 --> 00:26:36.733
We now know about
a government UFO program.

530
00:26:36.767 --> 00:26:42.635
but we might not know about
the government UFO program.

531
00:26:43.809 --> 00:26:44.603
[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

532
00:26:45.534 --> 00:26:47.260
NARRATOR: Pope has
told a story about

533
00:26:47.295 --> 00:26:49.746
a picture that hung
on the wall of his office
for years

534
00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.161
until being removed.

535
00:26:51.195 --> 00:26:54.440
The Calvine incident
from the United Kingdom.

536
00:26:54.474 --> 00:26:57.477
is one of the
most intriguing sightings

537
00:26:57.512 --> 00:26:59.928
in the British government's
UFO files.

538
00:26:59.963 --> 00:27:02.103
And for some years.

539
00:27:02.137 --> 00:27:06.348
when I was working in
Ministry of Defense
main building on this issue.

540
00:27:06.383 --> 00:27:11.353
we had a blown-up.
poster-sized enlargement

541
00:27:11.388 --> 00:27:15.047
of one of the photos
that was taken.

542
00:27:15.081 --> 00:27:17.187
The story is that two hikers

543
00:27:17.221 --> 00:27:20.466
were out and they saw
a large diamond-shaped UFO.

544
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.987
At one point.
there was a military jet
in the background.

545
00:27:24.021 --> 00:27:27.197
And then the UFO
accelerated away.

546
00:27:27.231 --> 00:27:29.164
We had looked at them
at the Ministry of Defense.

547
00:27:29.199 --> 00:27:35.205
They'd been analyzed by
various intelligence
community imagery analysts.

548
00:27:35.239 --> 00:27:37.069
It was literally a UFO.

549
00:27:37.103 --> 00:27:40.451
The Ministry of Defense
embarked on a campaign

550
00:27:40.486 --> 00:27:43.558
to declassify
and release its UFO files.

551
00:27:43.592 --> 00:27:47.286
Documents about the
Calvine incident emerged.

552
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.772
but the full-size color photos.

553
00:27:50.807 --> 00:27:54.120
the negatives.
the enlarged image
that was on my wall.

554
00:27:54.155 --> 00:27:56.019
gone. Disappeared.

555
00:27:56.053 --> 00:28:00.575
There was an effort to see
if the original photos

556
00:28:00.609 --> 00:28:05.994
might be in the hard copy file
held at the National Archives.

557
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:08.548
And. apparently.
the hard copy file

558
00:28:08.583 --> 00:28:11.793
will be released in
about the year 2072.

559
00:28:14.209 --> 00:28:16.039
NARRATOR: In an interesting
turn of events.

560
00:28:16.073 --> 00:28:18.179
just as we were
finishing this project.

561
00:28:18.213 --> 00:28:19.559
the picture appeared.

562
00:28:19.594 --> 00:28:22.873
This is the mysterious
Calvine UFO photograph.

563
00:28:22.908 --> 00:28:24.461
The facts around
this photograph

564
00:28:24.495 --> 00:28:26.670
strongly suggest
an unknown group

565
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:29.638
that was able to intercept
the release of this image

566
00:28:29.673 --> 00:28:30.985
and attempt to stop it.

567
00:28:31.019 --> 00:28:32.641
But who are they?

568
00:28:32.676 --> 00:28:34.851
Information in government.

569
00:28:34.885 --> 00:28:37.681
in particularly
intelligence information.

570
00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:42.928
it's highly classified.
deeply compartmentalized.

571
00:28:42.962 --> 00:28:44.619
everyone works in silos.

572
00:28:44.653 --> 00:28:47.553
The left hand often doesn't know
what the right hand's doing.

573
00:28:47.587 --> 00:28:50.349
NARRATOR: We saw an example
of compartmentalization

574
00:28:50.383 --> 00:28:52.731
and the evasion of scrutiny
and straight answers

575
00:28:52.765 --> 00:28:55.630
during the recent
Senate hearings on UFOs.

576
00:28:55.664 --> 00:28:59.323
So you're not aware
of anything in between
Project Blue Book and AATIP?

577
00:28:59.358 --> 00:29:01.394
Hasn't been brought
to my attention.

578
00:29:01.429 --> 00:29:04.708
That data is not within
the holdings of
the UAP task force.

579
00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:06.296
There are many things
that are out there in the ether

580
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:07.987
that aren't officially
brought to our attention.

581
00:29:08.022 --> 00:29:10.093
GALLAGHER:
How would it have to be
officially brought?

582
00:29:10.127 --> 00:29:11.922
[CHUCKLES] I'm bringing it
to your attention.

583
00:29:11.957 --> 00:29:14.338
Probably a lot of leads
that we would have
to follow up on.

584
00:29:14.373 --> 00:29:16.340
I don't think we have resource
to do that right now.

585
00:29:16.375 --> 00:29:18.515
All I can speak to is. you know.
what's within my cognizance.

586
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:21.414
the UAP task force.
and we have not looked
at that incident.

587
00:29:21.449 --> 00:29:23.106
And then. finally.
are you aware of a document

588
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.693
that appeared around 2019.

589
00:29:24.728 --> 00:29:28.697
sometimes called the
Admiral Wilson Memo
or E.W. Notes Memo?

590
00:29:28.732 --> 00:29:32.115
-I am... I am not...
-I'm not personally
aware of that.

591
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:35.670
NARRATOR:
These answers are made possible
by compartmentalization

592
00:29:35.704 --> 00:29:37.637
that aids in deniability.

593
00:29:37.672 --> 00:29:39.122
You can ask the questions.

594
00:29:39.156 --> 00:29:40.882
but who are you going
to ask them of?

595
00:29:40.917 --> 00:29:43.436
And you've got to
make sure you're asking
the right people the questions.

596
00:29:43.471 --> 00:29:45.611
because that's
another problem.

597
00:29:45.645 --> 00:29:47.578
You can ask questions
all day long.

598
00:29:49.995 --> 00:29:53.170
NARRATOR: While we're at it.
what is the Wilson-Davis Memo

599
00:29:53.205 --> 00:29:55.207
that Senator Gallagher
asked about?

600
00:29:55.241 --> 00:30:00.212
It's the leak of 15 pages
of notes by Dr. Eric Davis.

601
00:30:00.246 --> 00:30:03.767
of a meeting he had in 2002
with a retired member

602
00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:06.770
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Admiral Thomas R. Wilson.

603
00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:11.395
And the contents of these notes
are absolutely explosive.

604
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.019
NARRATOR: The Wilson-Davis Memo
was found in the files

605
00:30:14.053 --> 00:30:15.779
of the late Dr. Edgar Mitchell.

606
00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:18.402
It was the existence of
a reverse-engineering program

607
00:30:18.437 --> 00:30:21.647
to reverse-engineer
extraterrestrial technology.

608
00:30:21.681 --> 00:30:23.166
After he learned
about the existence

609
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.066
of a deep classified program
to study ET technology.

610
00:30:27.101 --> 00:30:32.416
And the fact that he had
genuine legal regulatory
oversight over this.

611
00:30:32.451 --> 00:30:34.763
how he was denied
access to this program.

612
00:30:34.798 --> 00:30:38.664
We'd retrieved
a functioning craft
that was ET in nature.

613
00:30:38.698 --> 00:30:40.700
I mean.
this is all stated in there.

614
00:30:40.735 --> 00:30:43.634
And that there
had been this long
reverse-engineering program.

615
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:45.705
But it had gone
into a corporate company.

616
00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.122
and the heads of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff

617
00:30:48.156 --> 00:30:49.606
have no business
looking into it.

618
00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.815
The memorable quote
on that note is.

619
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:54.335
"Technology not of this Earth.

620
00:30:54.369 --> 00:30:57.683
"not made by man.
not by human hands."

621
00:30:57.717 --> 00:30:59.616
They said. "No.
you're not read in."

622
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.895
NARRATOR: Admiral Wilson denies
the authenticity of the story.

623
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.622
Dr. Eric Davis plays
a significant role

624
00:31:05.656 --> 00:31:07.935
in the programs
we are describing here.

625
00:31:07.969 --> 00:31:09.729
the history and the research.

626
00:31:09.764 --> 00:31:11.352
He said this.

627
00:31:11.386 --> 00:31:16.322
"I am not at liberty
to confirm or verify
any aspect of those notes."

628
00:31:16.357 --> 00:31:18.704
These notes. in my view.

629
00:31:18.738 --> 00:31:20.602
there's no question
about their authenticity.

630
00:31:23.467 --> 00:31:25.504
NARRATOR: In a recent
presentation to Congress.

631
00:31:25.538 --> 00:31:28.058
MUFON. the Mutual UFO Network.

632
00:31:28.093 --> 00:31:32.476
presented a slide pointing out
nearly 20 government agencies

633
00:31:32.511 --> 00:31:36.101
that have some program
or study of UAP.

634
00:31:36.135 --> 00:31:37.516
There were many.

635
00:31:39.207 --> 00:31:40.726
In 1991.

636
00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.590
New York Times writer
Howard Blum

637
00:31:42.624 --> 00:31:44.592
released the bookOut There.

638
00:31:44.626 --> 00:31:47.284
In it.
he detailed an actual group

639
00:31:47.319 --> 00:31:50.218
formed by the Pentagon
to investigate new evidence

640
00:31:50.253 --> 00:31:53.014
related to an
extraterrestrial presence.

641
00:31:53.049 --> 00:31:57.294
This group.
referred to in the book
as the UFO Working Group.

642
00:31:57.329 --> 00:31:59.572
was led by
a shadowy army colonel

643
00:31:59.607 --> 00:32:02.575
referred to
as Colonel Phillips.

644
00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.406
It is believed that the
mysterious Colonel Phillips

645
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.858
represents a real colonel
who is even more of a mystery.

646
00:32:09.893 --> 00:32:14.346
Colonel John Alexander
is a central figure
in much of this history.

647
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:19.938
In 1985. he became the director
of advanced concepts
at the U.S. Army Lab.

648
00:32:20.593 --> 00:32:21.629
In 2009.

649
00:32:21.663 --> 00:32:24.839
John Alexander spoke
at the UFOX Conference

650
00:32:24.873 --> 00:32:27.324
and was interviewed
behind the scenes.

651
00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:32.260
What I think needs
to happen at this time
is not disclosure per se.

652
00:32:32.295 --> 00:32:33.848
because I don't think
there is much to disclose.

653
00:32:33.882 --> 00:32:38.094
What I think needs to happen
is we need to make it okay.

654
00:32:38.128 --> 00:32:41.614
permissible
for serious scientists

655
00:32:41.649 --> 00:32:44.169
who want to explore
these fields to do this.

656
00:32:44.203 --> 00:32:47.137
NARRATOR: Unknown at the time
of this original interview.

657
00:32:47.172 --> 00:32:48.483
he had been running a program

658
00:32:48.518 --> 00:32:51.210
exactly like the kind
described in Blum's book.

659
00:32:51.245 --> 00:32:55.870
KEAN:
A bunch of military. aerospace
and government insiders

660
00:32:55.904 --> 00:32:59.184
started with the
Advanced Theoretical Physics
Working Group.

661
00:32:59.218 --> 00:33:02.704
Now. there's even some
evidence that it existed
prior to that.

662
00:33:02.739 --> 00:33:06.570
I ran a program
inside the government.

663
00:33:06.605 --> 00:33:09.746
I had all of the
services involved.

664
00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.198
I had many aspects of
the Intelligence community.

665
00:33:13.232 --> 00:33:15.683
I had aerospace engineers.

666
00:33:15.717 --> 00:33:18.789
It was at the
top secret SCI level.

667
00:33:18.824 --> 00:33:21.378
so everybody had
the high clearances.

668
00:33:23.725 --> 00:33:26.280
They had this meeting
at BDM Corporation

669
00:33:26.314 --> 00:33:28.523
in a secure vault room and said.

670
00:33:28.558 --> 00:33:30.836
"We're forming up this group."

671
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.769
And that was in 1985.

672
00:33:32.803 --> 00:33:34.115
NARRATOR:
The real name of the group

673
00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:37.222
was the Advanced Theoretical
Physics Working Group.

674
00:33:37.256 --> 00:33:39.258
The study topics included

675
00:33:39.293 --> 00:33:41.398
Advanced Detector Deployment.

676
00:33:41.433 --> 00:33:45.678
Established Communication.
New Materials.

677
00:33:45.713 --> 00:33:48.440
Develop a
"Gravity Interaction System".

678
00:33:48.474 --> 00:33:51.098
"Biological Controls
of Processes".

679
00:33:51.995 --> 00:33:54.032
We start by saying it's real.

680
00:33:54.066 --> 00:33:55.447
So let's be clear.

681
00:33:55.481 --> 00:33:57.069
UFOs are real.

682
00:33:57.104 --> 00:33:58.691
sensor systems picked them up.

683
00:34:01.591 --> 00:34:04.939
UFOs have been around. you know.

684
00:34:04.973 --> 00:34:07.700
since. again.
the beginning of time.

685
00:34:07.735 --> 00:34:10.945
or recorded history
as we know it.

686
00:34:10.978 --> 00:34:14.328
It is a global phenomenon.

687
00:34:16.261 --> 00:34:19.471
One of the things that will
come up in this. undoubtedly.

688
00:34:19.505 --> 00:34:21.161
is the BAASS study

689
00:34:21.197 --> 00:34:23.337
or the one that
Lue Elizondo said

690
00:34:23.371 --> 00:34:26.271
came out in The New York Times.

691
00:34:26.304 --> 00:34:27.547
We spent a lot of time

692
00:34:27.581 --> 00:34:28.928
in the analysis piece of this.

693
00:34:28.963 --> 00:34:32.034
getting experts
within the community.

694
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.349
both the Department of Defense
and the Intelligence community.

695
00:34:35.382 --> 00:34:38.110
It basically followed
the same thing

696
00:34:38.145 --> 00:34:41.493
that I had done
30 years earlier

697
00:34:41.527 --> 00:34:45.635
and found. I think.
basically the same thing.

698
00:34:45.668 --> 00:34:47.360
What we're talking about
is something

699
00:34:47.395 --> 00:34:50.260
that is probably not ours
or adversarial.

700
00:34:50.295 --> 00:34:54.540
Something that we really just
don't know where it's from.

701
00:34:54.574 --> 00:34:56.473
And may have been frankly here
for quite a while.

702
00:34:56.507 --> 00:34:58.510
The things that they knew about

703
00:34:58.544 --> 00:35:02.134
the capabilities of UFOs
were being observed

704
00:35:02.169 --> 00:35:03.170
felt the same.

705
00:35:03.204 --> 00:35:06.828
Really fast.
high speed turns. anti-gravity.

706
00:35:06.863 --> 00:35:09.176
You know. things that
just can't happen.

707
00:35:11.695 --> 00:35:14.284
And first of all.
every sensorial system we have

708
00:35:14.319 --> 00:35:17.391
does pick up UFOs
from time to time.

709
00:35:17.425 --> 00:35:20.670
We have hard craft
more than a mile across.

710
00:35:20.704 --> 00:35:24.052
multi sensor.
I mean. absolutely real.

711
00:35:24.087 --> 00:35:27.677
And thousands and thousands
of variations in between.

712
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:30.473
UAP observed
and interacting with

713
00:35:30.507 --> 00:35:32.406
and flying over
sensitive military facilities.

714
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.855
and not just ranges.

715
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:37.204
but some facilities housing
our strategic nuclear forces.

716
00:35:37.238 --> 00:35:39.482
One such incident
allegedly occurred

717
00:35:39.516 --> 00:35:41.932
at Malmstrom Air Force Base.

718
00:35:41.967 --> 00:35:44.728
in which ten of
our nuclear ICBMs
were rendered inoperable.

719
00:35:44.763 --> 00:35:46.730
People do look at
some of these things.

720
00:35:46.765 --> 00:35:49.699
Particularly. the incidents
with F aded Giant

721
00:35:49.733 --> 00:35:53.151
that Bob Salas talks about
where you had missiles go down.

722
00:35:53.185 --> 00:35:54.635
Absolutely real.

723
00:35:54.669 --> 00:35:56.982
I have heard stories.
I have not seen
the official data.

724
00:35:57.016 --> 00:35:58.984
No official assessment

725
00:35:59.018 --> 00:36:02.919
that you've done or exist within
DOD that you're aware of

726
00:36:02.953 --> 00:36:04.748
regarding the
Malmstrom incident?

727
00:36:04.783 --> 00:36:06.025
We have not looked
at that incident.

728
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.889
You're the guys
investigating it.

729
00:36:07.924 --> 00:36:09.443
I mean. who else is doing it?

730
00:36:09.477 --> 00:36:14.033
Studied the hell out of it
and end up with.
"Have no idea."

731
00:36:17.002 --> 00:36:18.762
NARRATOR: This stunning
set of revelations

732
00:36:18.797 --> 00:36:21.696
places John Alexander
in the thick of the subject

733
00:36:21.731 --> 00:36:25.700
during the elusive
missing years
in question.

734
00:36:25.735 --> 00:36:28.358
A request for information
on the military background

735
00:36:28.393 --> 00:36:32.362
of Colonel John Alexander
returned an absolute refusal

736
00:36:32.397 --> 00:36:34.468
by the Department
of Army personnel.

737
00:36:34.502 --> 00:36:38.265
to even acknowledge
Colonel Alexander's
military record.

738
00:36:41.406 --> 00:36:43.166
After retiring from the Army.

739
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:47.066
John Alexander worked
at Los Alamos National Labs.

740
00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:48.620
In 1995.

741
00:36:48.654 --> 00:36:52.624
Alexander took a position
at a new research group
called NIDS.

742
00:36:52.658 --> 00:36:55.834
The National Institute
for Discovery Sciences.

743
00:36:55.868 --> 00:36:59.665
NIDS was founded by a Nevada
billionaire. Robert Bigelow.

744
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.427
These individuals became friends
with Robert Bigelow.

745
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:03.807
and they became
involved with him.

746
00:37:03.842 --> 00:37:06.672
Shortly after that.
another organization

747
00:37:06.707 --> 00:37:08.156
was formed called NIDS.

748
00:37:08.191 --> 00:37:10.642
National Institute
of Discovery Science.

749
00:37:10.676 --> 00:37:12.126
And Bigelow funded that.

750
00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.474
and it involved all these
same people and others.

751
00:37:15.509 --> 00:37:17.373
NARRATOR:
Shortly after forming NIDS.

752
00:37:17.407 --> 00:37:22.274
Robert Bigelow bought the
famous paranormal site known
as Skinwalker Ranch.

753
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:24.656
John Alexander was there.

754
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:25.898
I was with Bob.

755
00:37:26.761 --> 00:37:28.107
Robert Bigelow who owned it.

756
00:37:28.142 --> 00:37:30.282
I was with Bob the day
he bought the ranch.

757
00:37:30.317 --> 00:37:32.526
Was the first one to.

758
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.700
you know. spend the night.

759
00:37:34.735 --> 00:37:37.082
We spent years looking at that.

760
00:37:37.116 --> 00:37:40.085
NARRATOR: He would go on
to personally witness events

761
00:37:40.119 --> 00:37:42.260
that led him to
startling conclusions

762
00:37:42.294 --> 00:37:45.504
about the complexity
of unexplained phenomenon.

763
00:37:45.539 --> 00:37:48.783
There was no single phenomenon
that was happening at the ranch.

764
00:37:48.818 --> 00:37:52.718
The stories are so bizarre.
what you end up. though.

765
00:37:52.753 --> 00:37:56.135
with is something that
is terribly complex.

766
00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.104
maybe more complex
than we can imagine.

767
00:38:01.831 --> 00:38:04.109
NARRATOR: It wasn't long
before strange reports

768
00:38:04.143 --> 00:38:06.076
of unusual activity
at the ranch

769
00:38:06.111 --> 00:38:09.942
attracted the attention of the
Defense Intelligence Agency.

770
00:38:09.977 --> 00:38:11.599
You look at the guys involved.

771
00:38:11.634 --> 00:38:15.016
and some of them were.
I mean. we're talking
PhD-level scientists.

772
00:38:15.051 --> 00:38:19.124
NARRATOR: Robert Bigelow
went on to form Bigelow
Advanced Aerospace Studies.

773
00:38:19.158 --> 00:38:22.161
BAASS. as the
evolved version of NIDs.

774
00:38:22.196 --> 00:38:26.649
He was quickly rewarded
with a Defense Intelligence
Agency contract

775
00:38:26.683 --> 00:38:30.894
to study subjects closely tied
to the UAP phenomenon.

776
00:38:30.929 --> 00:38:33.345
According to
the original contract.

777
00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.209
some of these topics included.

778
00:38:35.243 --> 00:38:40.007
Lift. Propulsion. Control.
Power Generation.

779
00:38:40.041 --> 00:38:42.181
Spatial/Temporal Translation.

780
00:38:42.216 --> 00:38:45.633
Materials.
Structural Configuration.

781
00:38:45.668 --> 00:38:48.705
Signature Reduction.
Human Interface.

782
00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.984
Human Effects. and Armament.

783
00:38:52.019 --> 00:38:54.297
At one point.
BAASS brought on MUFON.

784
00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:55.919
the Mutual UFO Network.

785
00:38:55.954 --> 00:38:58.957
to help in the study
of UFO events around the world.

786
00:38:58.991 --> 00:39:01.753
Richard Lang ran
the program inside MUFON.

787
00:39:01.787 --> 00:39:03.582
When we put this
program together.

788
00:39:03.617 --> 00:39:05.377
basically what they were doing

789
00:39:05.412 --> 00:39:10.209
is they were paying MUFON
for data every month.

790
00:39:10.244 --> 00:39:12.142
At the time
that we put this all together.

791
00:39:12.177 --> 00:39:14.904
we didn't know that the DIA
was funding this.

792
00:39:14.938 --> 00:39:17.458
I knew based on some
of the conversations I had

793
00:39:17.493 --> 00:39:21.428
that there was
somebody funding that.
that wasn't Bigelow.

794
00:39:21.462 --> 00:39:22.636
but I didn't know who it was.

795
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.879
I assumed it was
some government agency.

796
00:39:27.192 --> 00:39:29.505
NARRATOR: The BAASS program
was called AAWSAP.

797
00:39:29.539 --> 00:39:33.854
It was the precursor program
to what we now know as AATIP.

798
00:39:33.888 --> 00:39:39.100
Lue Elizondo says
he took over the remains
of the program in 2009.

799
00:39:39.135 --> 00:39:44.209
So the initial focus of AATIP.
which was really AAWSAP.

800
00:39:44.243 --> 00:39:46.487
was very broad.

801
00:39:46.522 --> 00:39:51.009
So imagine trying to shoot a fly
with a shotgun. right?

802
00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.356
Chances are
you probably hit the fly.

803
00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:55.738
but chances are
you're going to hit a lot more.

804
00:39:55.772 --> 00:39:58.637
So we quickly realized
that we were getting
a lot of information

805
00:39:58.672 --> 00:40:01.399
as a result of this
broad focus very quickly.

806
00:40:01.433 --> 00:40:03.711
and we frankly. just didn't have
the staff to deal with it all.

807
00:40:03.746 --> 00:40:06.196
So a decision was made early on

808
00:40:06.231 --> 00:40:09.855
to focus a program.
the program was
renamed to AATIP.

809
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:13.203
and really use. let's say.
instead of a shotgun.

810
00:40:13.238 --> 00:40:15.999
maybe we're going to use
a sniper rifle this time. right?

811
00:40:16.034 --> 00:40:20.038
So much more focused
on what it is we were
trying to collect.

812
00:40:20.072 --> 00:40:24.767
and try to digest this elephant.
one bite at a time.

813
00:40:24.801 --> 00:40:27.597
And so the focus
of AATIP was indeed...

814
00:40:27.632 --> 00:40:29.357
Was indeed the phenomenon.

815
00:40:31.049 --> 00:40:33.603
Again. the challenge is.
where do you start?

816
00:40:33.638 --> 00:40:36.364
We have got.
and we may well get.

817
00:40:36.917 --> 00:40:38.125
interesting information.

818
00:40:38.159 --> 00:40:39.747
but we may never get all of it.

819
00:40:39.782 --> 00:40:42.405
What I'm afraid happens.
too. is that somebody

820
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:47.479
that has this knowledge.
passes away or goes on.

821
00:40:47.514 --> 00:40:50.448
and then the new person
coming in doesn't quite

822
00:40:50.482 --> 00:40:52.277
grasp what's going on.

823
00:40:52.311 --> 00:40:56.315
One difficulty with
getting information
from the military is.

824
00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.835
those who say don't know.

825
00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.528
Those who know don't say.

826
00:41:01.562 --> 00:41:03.806
In other words.
when someone says
that they know everything

827
00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:08.155
about what's happening
with the military.
then don't believe it.

828
00:41:08.189 --> 00:41:10.985
Because maybe there are things
that they don't know.

829
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.506
So I think the mantra here
is "Beware".

830
00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:15.680
That is. be cautious.

831
00:41:15.714 --> 00:41:19.097
Don't believe everything
you hear from the military.

832
00:41:19.131 --> 00:41:20.788
These private corporations
that are running

833
00:41:20.823 --> 00:41:23.135
the special access programs.
they are the Mafia.

834
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.933
They don't want anything
examining what they do.

835
00:41:27.968 --> 00:41:29.832
They've got the future
in their possession.

836
00:41:29.866 --> 00:41:33.594
They've got the most
exotic technology and
science imaginable.

837
00:41:33.629 --> 00:41:35.078
and they have it.

838
00:41:35.113 --> 00:41:37.805
Why would they possibly
want to share it?

839
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.014
Anybody that
does know the truth.

840
00:41:40.049 --> 00:41:41.602
I don't know their name.

841
00:41:41.637 --> 00:41:43.121
You don't know their name.

842
00:41:43.155 --> 00:41:45.054
They are not in
the public right now.

843
00:41:45.088 --> 00:41:46.918
They are not speaking
to anybody.

844
00:41:46.952 --> 00:41:48.471
They're not on camera.

845
00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:49.679
You don't know them.

846
00:41:49.714 --> 00:41:51.992
And that's where
the dark programs.
I think. come in.

847
00:41:52.026 --> 00:41:53.856
The Skunk Works
and things like that.

848
00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:58.274
It's where the government
and big business somehow
are interlocked.

849
00:41:58.308 --> 00:42:02.312
that we don't know
and there's somebody knows.

850
00:42:02.347 --> 00:42:05.281
Somebody is getting that money
and it's going somewhere.

851
00:42:09.975 --> 00:42:12.564
When it came to
investigating UFO mystery.

852
00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:14.048
a lot of people used to say

853
00:42:14.083 --> 00:42:17.120
that all roads lead to
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

854
00:42:17.155 --> 00:42:18.466
But in the last few years.

855
00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:21.124
and especially some of
the more controversial subjects.

856
00:42:21.159 --> 00:42:23.782
a lot of the roads
lead right here.

857
00:42:23.817 --> 00:42:26.129
NARRATOR:
Recently declassified documents

858
00:42:26.164 --> 00:42:28.925
now shed light on
the other aspects of BAASS

859
00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.307
and information that
may have originated

860
00:42:31.341 --> 00:42:33.792
from some of
these older programs.

861
00:42:33.827 --> 00:42:35.345
Since the early 1900s.

862
00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.141
there have been reports
of crashed UFOs.

863
00:42:38.176 --> 00:42:39.557
For over a century.

864
00:42:39.591 --> 00:42:42.456
hundreds of witnesses
have shared their accounts.

865
00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:46.046
There were 119 alleged
crash retrieval cases.

866
00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.220
All we need is one to be true.

867
00:42:48.255 --> 00:42:50.913
and it's disclosure right there.
All we need is one.

868
00:42:50.947 --> 00:42:53.985
So. some of the cases
that come to mind

869
00:42:54.019 --> 00:42:58.230
are certainly 1941.
Cape Girardeau. Missouri.

870
00:42:58.265 --> 00:43:00.163
where there were
three bodies recovered.

871
00:43:00.198 --> 00:43:01.889
The craft was
recovered as well.

872
00:43:01.924 --> 00:43:05.203
It's alleged that the bodies
in the craft were stored.

873
00:43:05.237 --> 00:43:06.549
not at the Pentagon.

874
00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:08.965
because the Pentagon
didn't exist in '41.

875
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.693
but in the basement
of the Capitol Building
in Washington. D.C.

876
00:43:12.728 --> 00:43:14.937
So that's 1941. Cape Girardeau.

877
00:43:14.971 --> 00:43:16.973
Now. move fast forward
six years.

878
00:43:17.008 --> 00:43:19.493
you've got July 2nd. 1947.

879
00:43:19.527 --> 00:43:21.978
You've got the
Roswell Crash retrieval.

880
00:43:22.013 --> 00:43:23.911
There was a small
egg-shaped craft

881
00:43:23.946 --> 00:43:26.086
the size of a Volkswagen
with a dome on top.

882
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.466
There were
five bodies recovered.

883
00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:29.468
one was still alive.
so that's Roswell.

884
00:43:29.503 --> 00:43:31.505
Move forward in 1953.

885
00:43:31.539 --> 00:43:33.369
you've got the Kingman.

886
00:43:33.403 --> 00:43:38.685
This is not the crash retrieval.
but it is a forced landing.

887
00:43:38.719 --> 00:43:40.583
There were
four beings associated

888
00:43:40.618 --> 00:43:43.275
with that particular
retrieval operation.

889
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:46.658
They were all live.
they did establish contact.

890
00:43:46.693 --> 00:43:49.730
That craft was
allegedly brought to the
remote test site in Nevada.

891
00:43:49.765 --> 00:43:54.355
Now. prior to that.
we've got the
'48 Aztec crash retrieval.

892
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:58.187
This was a 99.9 foot diameter.
disk-shaped craft.

893
00:43:58.221 --> 00:44:02.570
that had kind of a silver
outer exterior color.

894
00:44:02.605 --> 00:44:05.988
There were two bodies recovered
on the upper dome of the craft

895
00:44:06.022 --> 00:44:09.267
in the central part
of the rim of the craft.
On the interior.

896
00:44:09.301 --> 00:44:12.822
there were another 14 bodies
for a grand total of 16 bodies.

897
00:44:12.857 --> 00:44:17.137
That craft was allegedly
brought back to Los Alamos.
reassembled.

898
00:44:17.171 --> 00:44:21.589
and then the retrieval
operation or the reverse
engineering operation

899
00:44:21.624 --> 00:44:23.005
began at that point.

900
00:44:23.039 --> 00:44:25.697
These are some
of the retrieval operations

901
00:44:25.732 --> 00:44:29.701
in cases that come to mind
that. if we could get
one of these.

902
00:44:29.736 --> 00:44:34.568
the evidence for one of these.
it would push this field
of ufology forward.

903
00:44:34.602 --> 00:44:38.192
There's a red line
in this whole process that
you're not allowed to cross.

904
00:44:38.227 --> 00:44:41.368
And the red line is. well.
the conspiracy line.

905
00:44:41.402 --> 00:44:44.026
The red line is basically
crash retrievals.

906
00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.200
because if you acknowledge

907
00:44:46.235 --> 00:44:48.582
that there had been retrievals
of this technology.

908
00:44:49.134 --> 00:44:50.480
and bodies.

909
00:44:50.515 --> 00:44:54.001
there is no way to avoid
the obvious conclusion

910
00:44:54.036 --> 00:44:55.554
that this is a conspiracy.

911
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:59.662
Areas of materials recovery
to the extent that
they have been

912
00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:03.321
recovered in crashes.
are heavily classified.

913
00:45:03.355 --> 00:45:05.530
so we don't have access
to that material.

914
00:45:07.946 --> 00:45:10.880
NARRATOR: We know
about programs
that have existed to study

915
00:45:10.915 --> 00:45:14.504
and attempt to
reverse engineer
this technology.

916
00:45:14.539 --> 00:45:17.749
The evidence has been
circumstantial at best.

917
00:45:17.784 --> 00:45:19.475
Until now.

918
00:45:19.509 --> 00:45:22.616
Included in
the 2017 media flurry.

919
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:25.757
was an additional story
byThe New York Times.

920
00:45:25.792 --> 00:45:28.726
And they took the conversation
right to the edge.

921
00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.590
of crash retrievals.
Right to the precipice.

922
00:45:31.625 --> 00:45:33.869
If they took one more step.
they're going off that cliff

923
00:45:33.903 --> 00:45:36.492
and we're talking about
genuine UFO cash retrievals.

924
00:45:36.526 --> 00:45:38.632
What we do know. and what we put
in The New York Times.

925
00:45:38.666 --> 00:45:42.429
and I'm pretty proud of this
because it was as far as
we could go.

926
00:45:42.463 --> 00:45:48.676
that was fully documented.
was that a congressional
committee's staff

927
00:45:48.711 --> 00:45:55.614
were briefed on with slides
referring to material recovery.

928
00:45:55.649 --> 00:45:59.239
Apparent material recovery
from crashed UFOs...

929
00:46:00.033 --> 00:46:02.829
off-Earth. off-planet vehicles.

930
00:46:02.863 --> 00:46:05.693
DOLAN: They quoted
Eric Davis. they quoted
Harry Reid.

931
00:46:05.728 --> 00:46:08.696
both very positively

932
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:12.045
about UFO crash...
Can you imagine what that's like

933
00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:14.910
for The New York Times
to talk about
UFO crash retrievals?

934
00:46:14.944 --> 00:46:17.257
NARRATOR: Senator Harry Reid
was quoted as saying

935
00:46:17.291 --> 00:46:20.363
that materials recovered
from off-world craft

936
00:46:20.398 --> 00:46:23.021
were studied as part
of the AAWSAP Program.

937
00:46:23.056 --> 00:46:26.059
After the story broke.
Senator Reid
strongly objected

938
00:46:26.093 --> 00:46:29.717
to some of the wording
of the story
and demanded a retraction.

939
00:46:29.752 --> 00:46:31.961
The verbiage was
changed slightly.

940
00:46:31.996 --> 00:46:35.896
butThe Times still sticks by
its original reporting.

941
00:46:35.931 --> 00:46:39.866
Stories in The New York Times
were fully documented.
with named sources.

942
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:43.283
We didn't put in information
that hid the origin.

943
00:46:43.317 --> 00:46:44.663
It was very transparent.

944
00:46:44.698 --> 00:46:46.320
We said where
we got the information.

945
00:46:46.355 --> 00:46:47.701
we had briefing slides.

946
00:46:47.735 --> 00:46:50.531
One was put into a story
that we wrote inThe Times.

947
00:46:50.566 --> 00:46:53.880
We actually had
the slide. you know.

948
00:46:53.914 --> 00:46:58.332
copied and and pictured
in The New York Times.

949
00:46:58.367 --> 00:47:01.577
NARRATOR: Dr Eric Davis
again made an appearance.

950
00:47:01.611 --> 00:47:04.822
This time. it was reported
that he delivered
a presentation

951
00:47:04.856 --> 00:47:07.031
behind the closed doors
of Congress.

952
00:47:07.065 --> 00:47:10.172
acknowledging that some
materials were recovered

953
00:47:10.206 --> 00:47:12.519
from off-world craft.

954
00:47:12.553 --> 00:47:15.694
Dr. Davis is quoted
elsewhere as saying.

955
00:47:15.729 --> 00:47:18.732
"We have crash retrievals
and they've been analyzed.

956
00:47:18.766 --> 00:47:22.667
"The program was terminated
for lack of progress
in reverse engineering."

957
00:47:23.633 --> 00:47:25.670
Because there is no way
at that point

958
00:47:25.704 --> 00:47:28.362
that you can pretend
there's something out there.

959
00:47:28.397 --> 00:47:30.986
but we don't know what they are.
Which has been a little

960
00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.747
pretend game that everyone's
been playing all this time.

961
00:47:33.781 --> 00:47:35.576
Elizondo plays that game

962
00:47:35.611 --> 00:47:36.750
'cause he has to.

963
00:47:36.784 --> 00:47:38.856
'Cause he knows how far
he's allowed to go.

964
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.686
I'm not a whistleblower.
and as far as a leaker.

965
00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.171
I'll be damned if someone's
going to call me a leaker.
because a leaker's

966
00:47:44.206 --> 00:47:45.759
somebody who takes
classified information

967
00:47:45.793 --> 00:47:48.417
and provides it
in an unauthorized manner

968
00:47:48.451 --> 00:47:50.695
for the purpose of disclosure.

969
00:47:50.729 --> 00:47:53.042
I've never done that.
and I never will do that.

970
00:47:53.077 --> 00:47:55.665
Do you think
the U.S. Government has

971
00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.082
debris from a UFO
in its possession?

972
00:47:58.116 --> 00:48:01.879
Unfortunately. Tucker.
I really have to be careful
of my NDA.

973
00:48:01.913 --> 00:48:04.467
I really can't go into
a lot more detail than that.

974
00:48:04.502 --> 00:48:07.885
-Okay.
-But simply put. yes.

975
00:48:10.335 --> 00:48:12.372
NARRATOR: Chris Melon.
former undersecretary

976
00:48:12.406 --> 00:48:17.066
of Defense for Intelligence.
said in aWashington Post
Op Ed.

977
00:48:17.101 --> 00:48:20.449
that the government
had not been studying
the UFO topic.

978
00:48:20.483 --> 00:48:23.693
and because of his position.
he would know if it was.

979
00:48:23.728 --> 00:48:28.043
But when we pressed him on it.
he made a stunning statement.

980
00:48:28.077 --> 00:48:33.358
There's a bona fide
issue there. and I
understand that...

981
00:48:33.393 --> 00:48:36.914
I was part of a process
that was supposedly reviewing

982
00:48:36.948 --> 00:48:40.193
all of the Defense Department
special access programs.

983
00:48:40.227 --> 00:48:44.611
and I'd also...
People don't generally
understand this taxonomy.

984
00:48:44.645 --> 00:48:48.304
but there is
a world of programs within
the Defense Department

985
00:48:48.339 --> 00:48:51.411
that is entirely separate
and distinct from
the Intelligence community.

986
00:48:51.445 --> 00:48:53.585
and is not shared with
the Intelligence community.

987
00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.277
And to some extent. vice versa.

988
00:48:55.311 --> 00:48:58.418
In addition.
there's a group of programs at
the Department of Energy.

989
00:48:58.452 --> 00:49:00.868
and again.
those are not generally shared.

990
00:49:00.903 --> 00:49:04.424
So. there's sort of
three galaxies which intersect
to some degree

991
00:49:04.458 --> 00:49:06.944
of very tightly held programs.

992
00:49:06.978 --> 00:49:13.019
I was very deep on
two of the tree.
had some access to the third.

993
00:49:13.053 --> 00:49:16.401
But as I've often said
to people. "You don't know.
what you don't know."

994
00:49:16.436 --> 00:49:22.304
And you know. there is
a possibility that there is
some very small...

995
00:49:22.338 --> 00:49:26.998
tightly held close hold group.
for example. that has
some crash debris or something.

996
00:49:27.033 --> 00:49:28.275
and was working that...

997
00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.037
The rest of the department.
and even we didn't know about

998
00:49:31.071 --> 00:49:33.798
at the Special Access
Program Oversight Committee.

999
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:39.252
So now there are reports
of perhaps debris.

1000
00:49:39.286 --> 00:49:42.427
Debris left over from UFOs.

1001
00:49:42.462 --> 00:49:45.396
NARRATOR: Even with
thinly veiled admissions
from those in the know.

1002
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:49.883
and evidence pointing
to corporations having
received materials to study.

1003
00:49:49.917 --> 00:49:53.059
details about any of these
physical materials

1004
00:49:53.093 --> 00:49:54.922
have been unverifiable.

1005
00:49:54.957 --> 00:49:56.959
Recently. that changed.

1006
00:50:01.446 --> 00:50:05.795
UFO investigator Anthony Regalia
finally received a reply

1007
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:09.696
to a Freedom of Information Act
request that he filed
back in 2017.

1008
00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:15.702
pertaining to "Physical debris
recovered by personnel
of the Department of Defense

1009
00:50:15.736 --> 00:50:19.050
"as residue. flotsam.
shot-off material

1010
00:50:19.085 --> 00:50:22.640
"or crashed UAP.
or unidentified flying objects."

1011
00:50:22.674 --> 00:50:25.332
NARRATOR: After two years
of going back and forth.

1012
00:50:25.367 --> 00:50:27.403
and Ragalia's threat
of lawsuits.

1013
00:50:27.438 --> 00:50:30.475
the DIA admitted that
it had documents

1014
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.961
responsive to the request
on recovered debris.

1015
00:50:33.996 --> 00:50:38.483
and its analysis and a program
under which
it was administered.

Included in the FOIA release.
are reports about a
variety of advanced materials.

1017
00:50:43.626 --> 00:50:47.320
The reports speculated
about how they may be created.

1018
00:50:47.354 --> 00:50:49.356
and what they may be
capable of.

1019
00:50:49.391 --> 00:50:52.670
One is a well-known alloy.
called Nitinol.

1020
00:50:52.704 --> 00:50:56.950
It's a shapeable.
memory retaining
titanium alloy.

1021
00:50:56.984 --> 00:51:02.059
Nitinol enjoys wide use today
in a variety of applications.

1022
00:51:02.093 --> 00:51:05.614
But its capabilities bare
similarity to the many accounts

1023
00:51:05.648 --> 00:51:09.238
about the so called
Roswell memory metal.

1024
00:51:09.273 --> 00:51:10.895
Hey. is it from a crash?

1025
00:51:12.517 --> 00:51:13.553
How do you know about that?

1026
00:51:13.587 --> 00:51:14.761
We heard about it on the radio.

1027
00:51:14.795 --> 00:51:16.107
Everybody's talking about it.

1028
00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.078
Abracadabra.

1029
00:51:24.184 --> 00:51:26.393
How'd it do that?

1030
00:51:26.428 --> 00:51:30.156
NARRATOR: The origins
of Nitinol help make a case
for stories

1031
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:32.019
of extraterrestrial technology

1032
00:51:32.054 --> 00:51:35.161
being recovered and delivered
to science and industry.

1033
00:51:35.195 --> 00:51:40.614
It was supposedly invented
in a naval weapons research lab
in 1959.

1034
00:51:40.649 --> 00:51:44.411
But its origins have been
traced back even further.
to a corporation

1035
00:51:44.446 --> 00:51:47.034
called
Battelle Memorial Institute.

1036
00:51:47.069 --> 00:51:49.071
Since the late 1940s.

1037
00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:52.557
Battelle maintained a contract
to analyze metal samples

1038
00:51:52.592 --> 00:51:55.802
provided by Wright Patterson
Air Force Base.

1039
00:51:55.836 --> 00:52:00.565
Another is a class of materials
called metallic glass.

1040
00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.257
[COMPUTER BEEPING]

1041
00:52:04.362 --> 00:52:06.675
Transparent aluminum?

1042
00:52:06.709 --> 00:52:09.333
That's the ticket. laddie.

1043
00:52:09.367 --> 00:52:12.681
NARRATOR: The material
described in the Star Trek
filmVoyage Home

1044
00:52:12.715 --> 00:52:16.547
in 1986 actually exists.

1045
00:52:16.581 --> 00:52:18.756
We find upon further research.

1046
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:21.931
that the original patents
for this type of metallic glass

1047
00:52:21.966 --> 00:52:24.865
was initially applied for
in 1981

1048
00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.489
by the Raytheon Corporation.

1049
00:52:27.523 --> 00:52:30.492
These guys in the Lockheed
and TRW.

1050
00:52:30.526 --> 00:52:32.977
and McDonnell Douglas
or Boeing.

1051
00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.946
General Electric. Raytheon...

1052
00:52:38.396 --> 00:52:42.849
Look. there's no way
they're going to voluntarily
let this happen.

1053
00:52:45.369 --> 00:52:46.646
NARRATOR: There's more.

1054
00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.821
We now enter the stunning world
of meta materials.

1055
00:52:49.856 --> 00:52:54.378
In this recording.
from an interview Lue Elizondo
gave to the MUFON journal.

1056
00:52:54.412 --> 00:52:58.554
He discusses the finer points
of the materials claims.

1057
00:52:58.589 --> 00:53:02.696
ELIZONDO: So.
it was never about
unidentified metal alloys.

1058
00:53:02.731 --> 00:53:04.836
Any second year
metal artist will tell you

1059
00:53:04.871 --> 00:53:07.253
elements are elements.
and we can figure it out.

1060
00:53:07.287 --> 00:53:11.464
What was actually discussed
was certain meta materials

1061
00:53:11.498 --> 00:53:18.574
in which they're isotopic
ratios at the molecular level
are so unique.

1062
00:53:18.609 --> 00:53:22.820
and so precise.
based on the complexity

1063
00:53:22.854 --> 00:53:27.031
that the origins of those
materials remain unknown.

1064
00:53:27.065 --> 00:53:30.448
If we do encounter
extraterrestrial materials.

1065
00:53:30.483 --> 00:53:33.969
they would have isotopic ratios
that are not found on the earth

1066
00:53:34.003 --> 00:53:36.489
because of their exposure
to cosmic rays.

1067
00:53:36.523 --> 00:53:40.251
different kinds of manufacturer
they would differ from us.

1068
00:53:40.286 --> 00:53:46.223
And so that's one way to analyze
the fact that these are.
in fact extraterrestrial.

1069
00:53:46.257 --> 00:53:48.915
because they have different
isotopic ratios.

1070
00:53:51.849 --> 00:53:55.162
NARRATOR: There are more
space age materials
described in the reports

1071
00:53:55.197 --> 00:53:57.958
that the Defense Intelligence
Agency acknowledges.

1072
00:53:57.993 --> 00:54:01.065
One type may be
used to slow down light.

1073
00:54:01.099 --> 00:54:03.826
And even bring light
to a complete standstill.

1074
00:54:03.861 --> 00:54:09.729
Another may induce invisibility
by manipulating refraction.
reflectivity.

1075
00:54:09.763 --> 00:54:11.938
and increasing
light absorption.

1076
00:54:11.972 --> 00:54:15.321
Meta materials allow you to.
in principle.

1077
00:54:15.355 --> 00:54:20.084
make objects invisible.
In principle.
allow you to stop light.

1078
00:54:20.118 --> 00:54:22.224
In principle. allow you
to magnify things

1079
00:54:22.259 --> 00:54:25.192
beyond what we can do
with present day technology.

1080
00:54:25.227 --> 00:54:28.023
We can do that
in the microwave range.

1081
00:54:28.057 --> 00:54:31.647
We have not yet done it
in the optical frequencies.

1082
00:54:31.682 --> 00:54:34.616
NARRATOR: Another has
the interesting ability
to compress

1083
00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:36.549
electromagnetic energy.

1084
00:54:36.583 --> 00:54:38.896
Things that we would
consider impossible

1085
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:40.932
would become child's play

1086
00:54:40.967 --> 00:54:46.628
if you have a technology
that is centuries
more advanced than us.

1087
00:54:46.662 --> 00:54:50.321
NARRATOR: Still another
exhibits a particular
tunable resonance.

1088
00:54:50.356 --> 00:54:53.359
which was likely determined
during fabrication.

1089
00:54:53.393 --> 00:54:56.707
You see. if these objects
come from a civilization

1090
00:54:56.741 --> 00:55:00.055
more advanced than ours.
they have mastered the art

1091
00:55:00.089 --> 00:55:03.679
of manipulating
individual atoms.

1092
00:55:03.714 --> 00:55:07.269
NARRATOR: The reports
on these materials
have something in common.

1093
00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:10.307
They all talk about
what the materials might do.

1094
00:55:10.341 --> 00:55:12.343
and their possible uses.

1095
00:55:12.378 --> 00:55:14.690
This seems to be
an indirect confirmation

1096
00:55:14.725 --> 00:55:18.453
that we didn't create them.
and we're not sure
what they do.

1097
00:55:21.041 --> 00:55:24.907
And they have to be analyzed
on several levels.

1098
00:55:24.942 --> 00:55:27.738
First. they have to be analyzed
spectroscopically.

1099
00:55:27.772 --> 00:55:30.016
So we know what they're made of.

1100
00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:34.538
So let's say that there is...
There are materials

1101
00:55:34.572 --> 00:55:37.195
that some other civilization
has created

1102
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:40.440
and that they have
atomic grade printing

1103
00:55:40.475 --> 00:55:43.029
that we don't have today.

1104
00:55:43.063 --> 00:55:47.033
the only way to understand it
is to de-assemble it
atom by atom.

1105
00:55:47.067 --> 00:55:50.692
NARRATOR: Dr. Gary Nolan
is a scientist
at Stanford University.

1106
00:55:50.726 --> 00:55:54.868
He publicly stated that
a new technique
for mass spectrometry.

1107
00:55:54.903 --> 00:55:57.284
that he developed
attracted the attention

1108
00:55:57.319 --> 00:56:00.322
of those in possession
of UFO materials.

1109
00:56:00.357 --> 00:56:03.118
GARY NOLAN: Well. there is
one technology

1110
00:56:03.152 --> 00:56:06.570
that's in my lab called
Secondary Ion Mass Spec.

1111
00:56:06.604 --> 00:56:11.437
and we developed
a company around it
and the technology for using it

1112
00:56:11.471 --> 00:56:15.820
to read biopsy material
from patients. right?

1113
00:56:15.855 --> 00:56:19.272
And we had a way of
labeling the biopsies

1114
00:56:19.306 --> 00:56:25.658
with metal tags delivered via
antibodies. and that would
light up the tissue

1115
00:56:25.692 --> 00:56:29.903
in a way that would tell you
something about the distribution
of those proteins

1116
00:56:29.938 --> 00:56:32.596
in cancer cells
and immune system cells.

1117
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:35.322
That's a very
successful technology
that's worked very well.

1118
00:56:35.357 --> 00:56:39.672
It turns out that it was
tuned to look at metals...

1119
00:56:39.706 --> 00:56:42.088
right. because we were
using the metal tags

1120
00:56:42.122 --> 00:56:47.127
and so when in discussions
with Jacques and others.

1121
00:56:47.162 --> 00:56:49.302
that they said they had
these pieces of metal.

1122
00:56:49.336 --> 00:56:51.580
Well. I have an instrument
that's perfectly tuned

1123
00:56:51.615 --> 00:56:53.548
to look at metals.
so let's do it.

1124
00:56:53.582 --> 00:56:57.897
But what that stuff consisted of
and why they think
it's off-planet.

1125
00:56:57.931 --> 00:57:00.347
and. you know.
what the testing showed about

1126
00:57:00.382 --> 00:57:05.007
the possibility
that nothing like that
could appear on Earth.

1127
00:57:05.042 --> 00:57:07.872
That's all stuff we were not
able to get access to.

1128
00:57:07.907 --> 00:57:09.149
We don't know.

1129
00:57:09.184 --> 00:57:11.048
NARRATOR: Upon release
of the FOIA request.

1130
00:57:11.082 --> 00:57:15.639
there was evidence of
internal commotion inside
the DIA and the Pentagon.

1131
00:57:15.673 --> 00:57:17.157
You know. the powers that be...

1132
00:57:17.192 --> 00:57:18.607
I mean. there are such people.

1133
00:57:18.642 --> 00:57:20.264
I think they realized

1134
00:57:20.298 --> 00:57:22.059
"All right. You just went.
you went actually.
as far as you can go.

1135
00:57:22.093 --> 00:57:23.578
"and in fact.
you went a little too far.

1136
00:57:23.612 --> 00:57:25.234
"We're going to dial it back."

1137
00:57:25.269 --> 00:57:27.996
NARRATOR: Susan Gough.
a Pentagon spokesperson.

1138
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:29.722
said that although
she was aware

1139
00:57:29.756 --> 00:57:34.002
of the social media chatter.
the information provided
by the DIA

1140
00:57:34.036 --> 00:57:37.730
actually relates in some way
to an advanced weapons program

1141
00:57:37.764 --> 00:57:39.525
and not UFO items.

1142
00:57:39.559 --> 00:57:41.216
But if you start with
different assumptions

1143
00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:43.114
about how something
might operate.

1144
00:57:43.149 --> 00:57:46.808
you can come up with
things that another

1145
00:57:46.842 --> 00:57:51.951
equally advanced civilization.
America. let's say.
or Western civilization.

1146
00:57:51.985 --> 00:57:53.884
doesn't understand how it works.

1147
00:57:53.918 --> 00:57:56.818
But that doesn't mean
it came from E.T.

1148
00:57:56.852 --> 00:57:59.890
But I suspect that
Freedom of Information Act

1149
00:57:59.924 --> 00:58:01.547
is talking about something
a little different.

1150
00:58:04.722 --> 00:58:07.760
NARRATOR: Some of
the main players
in the material story

1151
00:58:07.794 --> 00:58:12.558
were making new statements
that changed
previously reported facts.

1152
00:58:12.592 --> 00:58:13.420
Right. This is a counter...

1153
00:58:13.455 --> 00:58:15.388
This is
The Empire Strikes Back.

1154
00:58:15.422 --> 00:58:18.978
This is what we're seeing.
You're seeing
the major establishment.

1155
00:58:19.012 --> 00:58:21.118
which was on the back foot
for over three years

1156
00:58:21.152 --> 00:58:24.121
because of the offensive of
the UFO faction.

1157
00:58:24.155 --> 00:58:26.986
They were on retreat.
They've gathered
their resources.

1158
00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.022
They're like. you know.
"We don't really want...

1159
00:58:29.057 --> 00:58:31.577
"We can't go any farther
than we've gone."

1160
00:58:31.611 --> 00:58:34.234
Harry Reid walked it back
as far as with
The New York Times

1161
00:58:34.269 --> 00:58:39.101
about Lockheed
having artifacts and so.
they get these phone calls.

1162
00:58:40.033 --> 00:58:41.828
I mean. why else...

1163
00:58:41.863 --> 00:58:44.831
You know. catch yourself
after the fact and go.

1164
00:58:44.866 --> 00:58:45.763
"I should have never said that."

1165
00:58:45.798 --> 00:58:47.006
And there's a pattern here.

1166
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:52.908
It always pertains to
physical evidence.

1167
00:58:52.943 --> 00:58:54.634
And in our
New York Timesstory.

1168
00:58:54.669 --> 00:58:57.464
we said that a hangar was built

1169
00:58:58.638 --> 00:59:03.747
to contain materials. okay.

1170
00:59:03.781 --> 00:59:08.130
We didn't say that materials
were obtained
and put in the hangar.

1171
00:59:08.165 --> 00:59:10.581
You did an interview with
Jesse Michaels.

1172
00:59:10.616 --> 00:59:14.171
-In that interview. you laid out
some of the materials.
-Mmm-hmm.

1173
00:59:14.205 --> 00:59:16.553
Very excitingly.
we have parts...

1174
00:59:16.587 --> 00:59:19.797
Okay. the parts were
a little anti-climactic
and small.

1175
00:59:19.832 --> 00:59:23.076
but he claims to have
much bigger parts
that we can't see

1176
00:59:23.111 --> 00:59:25.458
due to national security
sensitivities.

1177
00:59:25.492 --> 00:59:28.461
But then when you did
the interview with Lex.

1178
00:59:28.495 --> 00:59:32.223
you said that she had materials
just from. like. Jacques Vilet

1179
00:59:32.258 --> 00:59:33.915
which obviously
wouldn't be classified.

1180
00:59:33.949 --> 00:59:36.573
and from TTSA.
which wouldn't be classified.

1181
00:59:36.607 --> 00:59:41.508
There's two classes of materials
that I've been given by people.

1182
00:59:41.543 --> 00:59:43.925
and they're not given by. like.
the government or anything.

1183
00:59:43.959 --> 00:59:46.065
So have you studied
classified materials.

1184
00:59:46.099 --> 00:59:47.238
but you just don't have them?

1185
00:59:47.273 --> 00:59:48.826
I just shouldn't
say anything more.

1186
00:59:48.861 --> 00:59:50.000
You shouldn't say
anything about that.

1187
00:59:50.034 --> 00:59:51.484
Okay. all right.

1188
00:59:51.518 --> 00:59:53.210
You can put that on there.
I just can't say anything more.

1189
00:59:53.244 --> 00:59:54.521
Right. No. that's fine.

1190
00:59:54.556 --> 00:59:57.283
It might have been
an accidental truth moment.

1191
01:00:01.805 --> 01:00:06.741
NARRATOR: FOIA responses
are based on reacting
to very specific wording.

1192
01:00:06.775 --> 01:00:10.468
The FOIA response from the DIA
specifically refers

1193
01:00:10.503 --> 01:00:14.956
to recovered materials from
UFOs being studied
at Bigelow Aerospace.

1194
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:20.133
This is official confirmation
that these studies
indeed occurred.

1195
01:00:20.168 --> 01:00:21.963
Bigelow Aerospace is massive.

1196
01:00:21.997 --> 01:00:25.069
It's surrounded on most sides
by these gigantic vacant lots.

1197
01:00:25.104 --> 01:00:29.211
It's surrounded by
multiple layers of fencing.
including barbed wire.

1198
01:00:29.246 --> 01:00:33.146
video surveillance.
24-hour security guards
everywhere.

1199
01:00:33.181 --> 01:00:35.355
This place is a fortress.

1200
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:40.602
NARRATOR: Multiple reports also
seemed to confirm the presence
of materials at the facility.

1201
01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:44.295
But after the release
of the documents.
the story changed.

1202
01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:48.403
REPORTER: For years.
one of the secret studies
was carried out by BAASS.

1203
01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:51.958
a Las Vegas operation
hidden within
Bigelow Aerospace.

1204
01:00:51.993 --> 01:00:55.237
Documents first reported
by the I-Team show that BAASS

1205
01:00:55.272 --> 01:00:59.000
landed a contract with the DIA.
and one of the objectives

1206
01:00:59.034 --> 01:01:01.623
was to study
so called meta materials.

1207
01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.970
Multiple sources
have confirmed to us

1208
01:01:04.005 --> 01:01:07.456
there was a weird piece
of something at
the Bigelow plant.

1209
01:01:07.491 --> 01:01:11.806
New York Timesreported
that you modified
your facility here

1210
01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.154
in order to house some material
from somewhere else.

1211
01:01:15.741 --> 01:01:16.673
Did you ever have it?

1212
01:01:18.122 --> 01:01:20.090
-Never had any.
-Did you ever see it?

1213
01:01:20.711 --> 01:01:22.955
Um...

1214
01:01:22.989 --> 01:01:27.028
But... I... you know.
do you see...

1215
01:01:27.062 --> 01:01:28.167
Do you see...

1216
01:01:30.928 --> 01:01:36.071
It's the old Raiders of
the Lost Arkwarehouse scene.

1217
01:01:36.106 --> 01:01:37.728
"We've got our top people
working on it."

1218
01:01:37.763 --> 01:01:39.765
"Who are your top people?"
"Oh. they're top."

1219
01:01:39.799 --> 01:01:43.907
NARRATOR: In March 2022.
the Defense Intelligence Agency

1220
01:01:43.941 --> 01:01:47.358
responded to
another FOIA request
that demanded information

1221
01:01:47.393 --> 01:01:50.465
about the work of AATIP
and its previous versions.

1222
01:01:50.499 --> 01:01:55.470
The result was 1500 pages
that included
38 independent papers

1223
01:01:55.504 --> 01:01:58.059
about potential
advanced technology.

1224
01:01:58.093 --> 01:02:02.201
The authors of
some of these reports.
are many of the same people

1225
01:02:02.235 --> 01:02:05.031
that have been involved
in secret UFO programs

1226
01:02:05.066 --> 01:02:07.378
all the way back
to the late 1960s.

1227
01:02:07.413 --> 01:02:12.729
These reports came in the form
of defense intelligence
reference documents.

1228
01:02:12.763 --> 01:02:15.490
Some of the technologies
that were explored

1229
01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:18.458
include advanced
nuclear propulsion.

1230
01:02:18.493 --> 01:02:21.530
for manned deep space missions.

1231
01:02:21.565 --> 01:02:24.326
Aneutronic Fusion Propulsion.

1232
01:02:24.361 --> 01:02:28.227
Pulsed High-Power
Microwave Technology.

1233
01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:31.748
Antigravity for
Aerospace Applications.

1234
01:02:31.782 --> 01:02:35.268
I think when talking about
extraterrestrial civilizations.

1235
01:02:35.303 --> 01:02:37.995
we have to be open
to the fact that
their technology

1236
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:42.275
is thousands of years
more advanced
than our technology.

1237
01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:45.589
But then the question is.
is it possible that we.

1238
01:02:45.623 --> 01:02:51.112
that we humans can also partake
of some of these
advanced technologies?

1239
01:02:51.146 --> 01:02:55.012
NARRATOR: Space-Communication
Implications of
Quantum Entanglement

1240
01:02:55.047 --> 01:03:01.053
and Nonlocality.
High-Frequency Gravitational
Wave Communications.

1241
01:03:01.087 --> 01:03:03.883
I take two objects.

1242
01:03:03.918 --> 01:03:07.369
two particles that are
quantumly entangled.

1243
01:03:07.404 --> 01:03:10.787
and if I do something
to this one. this one responds.

1244
01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:14.307
And if you separate those two
by a foot...

1245
01:03:14.342 --> 01:03:16.585
when I do something here.
something happens here.

1246
01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.001
But something
even more magical happens

1247
01:03:18.035 --> 01:03:20.969
that when I take these objects.
and I put them one here

1248
01:03:21.004 --> 01:03:23.696
and one at the farthest end
of the visible universe.

1249
01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:26.872
that direction.
13.5 billion light years.

1250
01:03:26.906 --> 01:03:28.149
and I take the other particle.

1251
01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:32.636
I put it in that direction.
13.5 billion light years away.

1252
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.465
when I do this.

1253
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.952
this one responds
instantaneously.

1254
01:03:37.986 --> 01:03:42.611
NARRATOR:
Traversable Wormholes.
Stargates and Negative Energy.

1255
01:03:42.646 --> 01:03:46.063
Special relativity says
you cannot break
the light barrier.

1256
01:03:46.098 --> 01:03:49.584
But special relativity
has a loophole.

1257
01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:52.104
The loophole is
general relativity.

1258
01:03:52.138 --> 01:03:53.726
the theory of gravity.

1259
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.385
whereby you can bend time
and space into a pretzel

1260
01:03:57.419 --> 01:04:00.250
if you have enough matter
and energy.

1261
01:04:00.284 --> 01:04:06.118
An energy which we won't have.
perhaps for another 100.000
to one million years.

1262
01:04:06.152 --> 01:04:08.396
So it's not for us.

1263
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:11.295
Perhaps for an
extraterrestrial civilization.

1264
01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:13.332
but it's not for us.

1265
01:04:13.366 --> 01:04:15.575
NARRATOR: Warp Drive.
Dark Energy

1266
01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:18.337
and the manipulation
of extra dimensions.

1267
01:04:18.371 --> 01:04:23.756
We have to be open
to the possibility that there
are other dimensions.

1268
01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:25.240
and shortcuts.

1269
01:04:25.275 --> 01:04:29.072
Perhaps shortcuts between
different universes.

1270
01:04:29.106 --> 01:04:30.418
Now. of course. moving through

1271
01:04:30.452 --> 01:04:33.283
these higher dimensions.
would require a technology

1272
01:04:33.317 --> 01:04:36.217
much more advanced
than anything we have.

1273
01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:40.462
NARRATOR: Concepts for
extracting energy from
the quantum vacuum.

1274
01:04:40.497 --> 01:04:42.775
You would have to be
a very advanced civilization

1275
01:04:42.809 --> 01:04:46.572
to get net usable energy
from nothing.

1276
01:04:46.606 --> 01:04:48.850
In other words. it's not for us.

1277
01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:52.716
That doesn't mean
an advanced civilization
can't do it.

1278
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:56.133
NARRATOR: Quantum computing.
and utilizing
organic molecules

1279
01:04:56.168 --> 01:04:58.687
in automation technology.

1280
01:04:58.722 --> 01:05:02.346
Technological approaches
to controlling
external devices.

1281
01:05:02.381 --> 01:05:05.004
in the absence of limb
operated interfaces.

1282
01:05:05.039 --> 01:05:09.491
Our most advanced understanding
of the brain comes from BCI.

1283
01:05:09.526 --> 01:05:12.253
Brain Computer Interface.

1284
01:05:12.287 --> 01:05:15.981
We can take a chip. put it on
the surface of the brain.

1285
01:05:16.015 --> 01:05:19.087
have that chip connected
to a laptop computer

1286
01:05:19.122 --> 01:05:23.678
that then analyzes the impulses
of the brain and deciphers it.

1287
01:05:23.712 --> 01:05:26.750
and then uses it
to control something.

1288
01:05:26.784 --> 01:05:29.753
And so you can imagine
what we can do today

1289
01:05:29.787 --> 01:05:33.136
and then extrapolate
to the future.

1290
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:36.760
NARRATOR: Aerospace
applications of
programmable matter.

1291
01:05:36.794 --> 01:05:40.626
If you could design something.
atom by atom.

1292
01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:44.078
and position things
atom by atom.

1293
01:05:44.112 --> 01:05:47.598
then there's a lot more
we could do with
material science

1294
01:05:47.633 --> 01:05:49.497
than we can do today.

1295
01:05:49.531 --> 01:05:54.709
NARRATOR: Ultra capacitors
as energy and power
storage devices.

1296
01:05:54.743 --> 01:05:57.815
Role of superconductors
in gravity research.

1297
01:05:57.850 --> 01:06:04.270
Most of what we create today.
in even the superconductor areas

1298
01:06:04.305 --> 01:06:07.066
is basically recipes.

1299
01:06:07.101 --> 01:06:08.861
They are not designs.

1300
01:06:08.895 --> 01:06:12.934
NARRATOR: Many of these
technologies are beyond
the realm of current science.

1301
01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:15.178
These technologies
are discussed

1302
01:06:15.212 --> 01:06:19.078
as if someone knows that
they are entirely possible.

1303
01:06:19.113 --> 01:06:22.288
even in some stage
of successful development.

1304
01:06:22.323 --> 01:06:25.912
I will tell you unequivocally
if a man like Robert Bigelow

1305
01:06:25.947 --> 01:06:29.640
were to ask you.
to come on board
and to do something.

1306
01:06:29.675 --> 01:06:35.439
man. I would do it
in the blink of an eye.

1307
01:06:35.474 --> 01:06:37.441
It would be almost reflexive.

1308
01:06:37.476 --> 01:06:39.236
When do we start? Let's go.

1309
01:06:39.271 --> 01:06:41.514
He's a good man.
and he's also a patriot.

1310
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:43.792
Machinery really does exist.

1311
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:47.037
Does exist.

1312
01:06:47.072 --> 01:06:53.147
That the problem has been
the inability to back engineer

1313
01:06:53.181 --> 01:06:57.979
and I kind of think
that some...

1314
01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:01.465
Some things require
a weightless environment.

1315
01:07:10.785 --> 01:07:12.476
NARRATOR: It is
generally accepted

1316
01:07:12.511 --> 01:07:15.548
that the New Narrative
broke in late 2017.

1317
01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:19.828
It was actually
Robert Bigelow. who made
spellbinding revelations

1318
01:07:19.863 --> 01:07:24.074
before anybody knew
that he was involved
in government contracts

1319
01:07:24.109 --> 01:07:25.627
to study UFOs.

1320
01:07:29.355 --> 01:07:30.908
Do you believe in aliens?

1321
01:07:30.943 --> 01:07:33.773
I am absolutely convinced.
That's all there is to it.

1322
01:07:33.808 --> 01:07:36.776
Do you also believe
that UFOs have come to Earth?

1323
01:07:36.811 --> 01:07:40.366
There has been.
and is an existing presence
an E.T. presence.

1324
01:07:40.401 --> 01:07:42.575
You have the interview
that Robert Bigelow did
on 60 Minutes.

1325
01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:45.440
Really. an amazing interview.

1326
01:07:45.475 --> 01:07:49.927
This is one of the most
knowledgeable people
on this planet.

1327
01:07:49.962 --> 01:07:52.275
in my view.
on the subject of UFOs.

1328
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:55.450
He's also a billionaire.
and he's also got a lot of
influence in this world.

1329
01:07:55.485 --> 01:07:58.074
And here he is saying.
aliens are real

1330
01:07:58.108 --> 01:08:00.455
and indeed they are actually
walking among us.

1331
01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:03.044
NARRATOR:
His unshakable statement
regarding the reality

1332
01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.460
of an extraterrestrial
presence.

1333
01:08:05.495 --> 01:08:08.014
drew some media reaction.

1334
01:08:08.049 --> 01:08:10.569
Its significance did not
become clear

1335
01:08:10.603 --> 01:08:13.123
until the story of
Bigelow Aerospace

1336
01:08:13.158 --> 01:08:16.712
and its role in AATIP
began to unfold.

1337
01:08:16.746 --> 01:08:21.476
The New York Timescame out
with a couple of articles
essentially downplaying any E.T.

1338
01:08:21.511 --> 01:08:23.167
component of these sightings.

1339
01:08:23.202 --> 01:08:27.137
but also playing down the fact
that they may be
Russian or Chinese

1340
01:08:27.172 --> 01:08:34.800
and also playing down the fact
that these are advanced
U.S. classified prototypes.

1341
01:08:34.834 --> 01:08:36.457
If they're going to play
all of those things down.

1342
01:08:36.491 --> 01:08:41.393
then I would ask.
what gets played up?
Because there is nothing left.

1343
01:08:41.426 --> 01:08:44.189
NARRATOR: Confronted with
the challenge of weaving
Robert Bigelow's

1344
01:08:44.223 --> 01:08:45.707
informed beliefs

1345
01:08:45.742 --> 01:08:48.124
into the story Chris Mellon
had revealed.

1346
01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:51.299
-Mellon said this.
-There aren't many people

1347
01:08:51.334 --> 01:08:55.786
associated with
the establishment
who are so bold

1348
01:08:55.821 --> 01:09:00.032
and willing to make
statements like that.

1349
01:09:00.066 --> 01:09:05.140
Many of the Navy pilots
themselves who've engaged
these crafts

1350
01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:09.317
go there because they can't
conceive of any
other explanation. frankly.

1351
01:09:09.352 --> 01:09:12.907
NARRATOR: When Lue Elizondo
was asked about
Bigelow statements.

1352
01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:16.048
his response corroborated
Bigelow's position.

1353
01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:19.015
He has his own space stations
in space.

1354
01:09:19.050 --> 01:09:20.259
People say
"What do you mean?"

1355
01:09:20.294 --> 01:09:24.332
Yeah. he has his own.
right now. in space.

1356
01:09:24.367 --> 01:09:27.370
I mean. I don't know who else
has done that. and by the way.

1357
01:09:27.404 --> 01:09:31.822
he's done it for a long time.
so give the guy some credit.

1358
01:09:31.857 --> 01:09:33.617
He knows
what he's talking about.

1359
01:09:35.861 --> 01:09:39.865
They have stated flatly
"They're not one of ours."

1360
01:09:39.898 --> 01:09:42.970
Then the question is.
whose are they?

1361
01:09:43.005 --> 01:09:45.388
NARRATOR: All of
the people involved in
the current narrative

1362
01:09:45.422 --> 01:09:47.183
are deliberately
stopping short

1363
01:09:47.217 --> 01:09:52.291
of identifying the phenomenon
as originating
from extraterrestrials.

1364
01:09:52.326 --> 01:09:56.709
We have all these tales
going back centuries. millennia.

1365
01:09:56.744 --> 01:09:59.987
about visitations
and strange beings.

1366
01:10:00.023 --> 01:10:04.476
Maybe it's a record of visits
from alien civilizations.

1367
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:08.825
You can't rule out the fact
that. yeah. maybe we have
been visited in the past.

1368
01:10:08.859 --> 01:10:10.240
You can't rule it out.

1369
01:10:10.275 --> 01:10:14.071
So you say one by one.
they're not natural phenomena.

1370
01:10:15.487 --> 01:10:16.867
They're not weather balloons.

1371
01:10:16.902 --> 01:10:18.144
They're not U.S. technology.

1372
01:10:18.179 --> 01:10:20.008
They're not Russian.
They're not Chinese.

1373
01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.563
They're not optical illusions.

1374
01:10:22.597 --> 01:10:26.118
They're not mental illness
on the part of the people
who report them.

1375
01:10:26.152 --> 01:10:28.844
Because these are our most
highly trained experts

1376
01:10:28.879 --> 01:10:30.880
who are reporting these things.
and they've been caught on.

1377
01:10:30.916 --> 01:10:35.748
as I said. Navy instrumentation.
So what are you left with?

1378
01:10:35.782 --> 01:10:37.335
Well. no one is going there.

1379
01:10:37.371 --> 01:10:40.339
Our view is. let's follow
the trail wherever it leads.

1380
01:10:40.374 --> 01:10:41.271
Let's get the data.

1381
01:10:41.306 --> 01:10:43.342
the best evidence possible.

1382
01:10:43.377 --> 01:10:47.035
There's probably more
than one phenomenon
at work here.

1383
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:49.693
NARRATOR: They refused
to say the "A" word.

1384
01:10:50.418 --> 01:10:53.110
Alien. Why?

1385
01:10:53.145 --> 01:10:56.769
You know. assuming that
these things are
all of alien origin...

1386
01:10:58.875 --> 01:11:01.912
for a variety reasons.
in part because
people shut down

1387
01:11:01.947 --> 01:11:07.159
and it impedes our progress
and some of the allies

1388
01:11:07.193 --> 01:11:09.644
and people that we need
to bring to bear.

1389
01:11:09.679 --> 01:11:12.544
who are sort of
now getting on board.

1390
01:11:12.577 --> 01:11:16.996
wouldn't do so if we started
with the premise that
these are aliens.

1391
01:11:17.031 --> 01:11:19.689
I think the word alien
is a little...

1392
01:11:19.723 --> 01:11:22.312
People are afraid of
the word alien.

1393
01:11:22.347 --> 01:11:25.728
You know. E.T.
extraterrestrial. non-humans.

1394
01:11:25.764 --> 01:11:28.732
I've always concerned about

1395
01:11:28.767 --> 01:11:33.943
getting ahead of
our headlights. frankly.

1396
01:11:33.978 --> 01:11:36.326
and leaping to conclusions.

1397
01:11:36.361 --> 01:11:39.225
For me. it's more of
the thrill of the hunt.

1398
01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:42.332
It's trying to figure out
the unknowns

1399
01:11:42.367 --> 01:11:46.818
because once they are known.
they are no longer a mystery.

1400
01:11:46.853 --> 01:11:48.994
What it is.
no one's admitted yet.

1401
01:11:49.028 --> 01:11:51.272
And you've got
plenty of video evidence

1402
01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:56.380
of Lue and Chris
not admitting it
because they can't say it.

1403
01:11:56.415 --> 01:11:58.969
But they've said it
in as many ways
as you can.

1404
01:11:59.004 --> 01:12:02.214
Just anybody bright enough
to listen.

1405
01:12:02.248 --> 01:12:05.112
will. as you say.
understand the accidental truth.

1406
01:12:13.259 --> 01:12:19.507
NARRATOR: During the interview
in 2018. Lue Elizondo
gave us an accidental truth.

1407
01:12:19.541 --> 01:12:22.752
JAMES: So.
you've spoken about
some of the technologies

1408
01:12:22.786 --> 01:12:25.341
that are being studied
as a spin off the research

1409
01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:26.996
you did at AATIP.

1410
01:12:27.032 --> 01:12:32.139
Things like bending space-time.
and Einstein type possibilities
that may unfold.

1411
01:12:32.175 --> 01:12:35.005
Is there an interdimensional
element to any of this

1412
01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.835
that you guys maybe explored?

1413
01:12:38.871 --> 01:12:40.666
Other dimensions
may absolutely exist.

1414
01:12:40.701 --> 01:12:43.013
You look at String Theory.
look at M Theory.

1415
01:12:43.048 --> 01:12:45.602
dimensions are all around us.

1416
01:12:45.637 --> 01:12:50.814
So I think you have to
cast a wide net
when you're looking at this.

1417
01:12:50.849 --> 01:12:53.264
And that's why I've said before.
whether they're
from outer space.

1418
01:12:53.299 --> 01:12:54.956
inner space
or the space in between.

1419
01:12:54.991 --> 01:12:58.235
we just don't know.
and we need to collect
more data.

1420
01:12:58.270 --> 01:13:00.928
Is it possible?
Absolutely. it's possible.

1421
01:13:00.962 --> 01:13:03.724
Is it possible that
they're from the Pleiades? Sure.

1422
01:13:03.758 --> 01:13:05.035
Is it possible that
they're from...

1423
01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:07.037
They've been here all along
and they're from here.

1424
01:13:07.072 --> 01:13:10.455
they're just resonating
at a different vibration?

1425
01:13:10.489 --> 01:13:12.284
Sure.

1426
01:13:12.318 --> 01:13:15.563
JAMES: It seems like
the only question
that is answered

1427
01:13:15.598 --> 01:13:17.323
in the ones you just posed.

1428
01:13:17.358 --> 01:13:21.293
is that whether or not.
there is an actual "They."

1429
01:13:21.844 --> 01:13:23.916
That's a great question.

1430
01:13:23.951 --> 01:13:25.434
I don't know
if I can answer that.

1431
01:13:27.955 --> 01:13:31.337
NARRATOR: A few seem willing
to officially pronounce
the phenomenon

1432
01:13:31.371 --> 01:13:34.271
as originating
from extraterrestrials.

1433
01:13:34.306 --> 01:13:36.377
There is a willingness
to concede

1434
01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:39.449
that there might be
extraterrestrial involvement.

1435
01:13:39.484 --> 01:13:41.486
You know. what's here
is probably just an A.I.

1436
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:46.041
I mean. why spend all your time
on one little planet

1437
01:13:46.076 --> 01:13:48.700
out in a dust speck
at the edge of the galaxy?

1438
01:13:48.734 --> 01:13:50.529
You send your robots.

1439
01:13:50.564 --> 01:13:54.153
The question is.
what's our definition of life?

1440
01:13:54.188 --> 01:13:57.778
I think life may exist.
may exist.

1441
01:13:57.812 --> 01:14:02.127
and I'll caveat that.
in all sorts of forms.

1442
01:14:02.161 --> 01:14:03.922
I don't think it's necessarily
going to be

1443
01:14:03.956 --> 01:14:08.960
something that we might
recognize or even initially
even classify as life.

1444
01:14:08.996 --> 01:14:11.273
Because we don't have
a full understanding of it.

1445
01:14:11.308 --> 01:14:13.241
NARRATOR: There is
a growing consensus

1446
01:14:13.276 --> 01:14:15.796
that the
extraterrestrial hypothesis

1447
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:17.936
doesn't answer all
of the questions.

1448
01:14:17.969 --> 01:14:22.388
There are multiple phenomena
at work. that cannot be
explained completely

1449
01:14:22.423 --> 01:14:24.632
without looking at
other possibilities.

1450
01:14:24.666 --> 01:14:27.704
Maybe there's a whole range
of different phenomena
at play here.

1451
01:14:27.739 --> 01:14:33.779
In fact. I think. given
the differences in what's been
reported by people.

1452
01:14:33.814 --> 01:14:38.957
that's quite likely that
there are many different
parallel strands to this.

1453
01:14:38.991 --> 01:14:42.581
But whatever is involved.
and as I say. I don't know.

1454
01:14:42.616 --> 01:14:48.794
I think it does raise important
defense. national security
and air safety issues.

1455
01:14:48.829 --> 01:14:53.764
The E.T. hypothesis.
for instance.
is a logical starting point.

1456
01:14:53.799 --> 01:14:55.594
If not from here. from where?

1457
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:59.564
Until you start
talking about. well.
what do you mean. where?

1458
01:14:59.598 --> 01:15:05.362
We think that an object
is solid and can only be
one place at the same time.

1459
01:15:05.397 --> 01:15:09.850
But in quantum mechanics.
electrons can be two places
at the same time.

1460
01:15:09.884 --> 01:15:11.507
In fact. they can be
many places.

1461
01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:14.579
and this is called
the multiverse idea.

1462
01:15:14.612 --> 01:15:19.031
The idea that we exist
with other universes
simultaneously.

1463
01:15:19.584 --> 01:15:20.654
Well. wait a minute.

1464
01:15:20.688 --> 01:15:24.139
We're talking about
multi-dimensional realities.

1465
01:15:24.174 --> 01:15:26.073
But doesn't really matter
how far you go

1466
01:15:26.107 --> 01:15:28.420
in a three-dimensional space
and distance.

1467
01:15:28.454 --> 01:15:32.112
that there are shortcuts.
and those shortcuts exist

1468
01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:35.254
as part of the natural universe.

1469
01:15:35.289 --> 01:15:37.532
So that is a real world example
where we know

1470
01:15:38.844 --> 01:15:40.674
other dimensions
may absolutely exist.

1471
01:15:40.708 --> 01:15:46.921
Whether it's extraterrestrial
or interdimensional.
to me. is irrelevant

1472
01:15:46.956 --> 01:15:49.579
because whatever it is.
clearly has

1473
01:15:49.614 --> 01:15:53.202
the ability to manipulate
dimensionality.

1474
01:15:53.237 --> 01:15:58.519
These things can
jump in and out.
appear. disappear.

1475
01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:02.281
And so. for all intents
and purposes. it's both.

1476
01:16:02.316 --> 01:16:07.701
NARRATOR: In August of 2022.
Dr. Hal Puthoff released
a paper in which he explored

1477
01:16:07.735 --> 01:16:10.462
other options
for what may be at work.

1478
01:16:10.496 --> 01:16:14.603
He presented
concepts such as
ultra-terrestrial beings.

1479
01:16:14.639 --> 01:16:18.850
The concept that
there could be another
intelligent race living with us

1480
01:16:18.884 --> 01:16:21.162
inside the Earth
or under water.

1481
01:16:21.197 --> 01:16:24.027
A civilization
with advanced technology.

1482
01:16:24.062 --> 01:16:26.892
that has been here.
long before us.

1483
01:16:26.927 --> 01:16:28.722
Time travelers.

1484
01:16:28.755 --> 01:16:32.691
While mainstream science
debates the feasibility
of time travel.

1485
01:16:32.726 --> 01:16:35.175
it still remains a possibility.

1486
01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:38.870
Some people say that the aliens
don't come from Mars.

1487
01:16:38.904 --> 01:16:40.906
they don't come
from a distant star.

1488
01:16:40.941 --> 01:16:43.391
They come from a different time.

1489
01:16:43.425 --> 01:16:45.808
Well. I'm open
to all sorts of ideas.

1490
01:16:45.842 --> 01:16:47.775
as long as they are testable.

1491
01:16:47.809 --> 01:16:53.332
Our notion of time and space
is flawed. seriously.

1492
01:16:53.367 --> 01:16:56.232
And you're entering
issues where

1493
01:16:56.266 --> 01:16:58.889
there is no time
and there is no space.

1494
01:16:58.924 --> 01:17:01.306
You've got man-made craft.

1495
01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:04.343
You've got possible
extraterrestrial.

1496
01:17:04.378 --> 01:17:06.035
You've got interdimensional.

1497
01:17:06.068 --> 01:17:07.553
You've got...

1498
01:17:07.588 --> 01:17:10.384
Hmm. A pre-existing
high tech civilization

1499
01:17:10.418 --> 01:17:12.351
that could have been
on this planet
for thousands of years.

1500
01:17:12.386 --> 01:17:14.008
And when you wrap
this all together.

1501
01:17:14.043 --> 01:17:17.425
you can see how confusing it is
because a lot of
these things merge.

1502
01:17:19.393 --> 01:17:22.189
NARRATOR: Some of the
phenomena seemed to point

1503
01:17:22.223 --> 01:17:25.606
to a direct interaction.
with consciousness.

1504
01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:30.922
Well. the consciousness
is interacting in
all aspects of it.

1505
01:17:30.956 --> 01:17:32.682
And to take it a step farther.

1506
01:17:32.717 --> 01:17:36.134
going to Max Planck.
suggests that maybe

1507
01:17:36.168 --> 01:17:40.897
the physical evolved
from consciousness.

1508
01:17:40.932 --> 01:17:42.796
as opposed to
the other way around.

1509
01:17:49.975 --> 01:17:52.598
NARRATOR: As part of developing
new understandings.

1510
01:17:52.633 --> 01:17:56.499
it's hard to ignore
the so-called experience
or phenomenon.

1511
01:17:56.532 --> 01:17:59.191
A significant percentage
of the population

1512
01:17:59.226 --> 01:18:02.574
report having encounters
with non-human beings.

1513
01:18:02.608 --> 01:18:06.577
These encounters range
from enlightening
to terrifying.

1514
01:18:06.612 --> 01:18:12.204
Many. many. many people
have had some very
strange experiences.

1515
01:18:12.239 --> 01:18:17.106
Either seeing UFOs.
and not just at night
while they were dreaming.

1516
01:18:17.139 --> 01:18:19.728
These are not nightmares.

1517
01:18:19.764 --> 01:18:24.423
These are often described
as more real
than everyday reality.

1518
01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:27.460
The people who describe it.
these people are solid.

1519
01:18:27.495 --> 01:18:29.463
They come from
all walks of life.

1520
01:18:29.496 --> 01:18:32.984
NARRATOR: Ralph Blumenthal
wrote a book about the late
Harvard psychologist John Mack.

1521
01:18:33.018 --> 01:18:34.882
calledThe Believer.

1522
01:18:34.916 --> 01:18:37.402
Mack was one of the first
members of academia

1523
01:18:37.436 --> 01:18:40.818
to acknowledge the validity of
the experience or phenomenon.

1524
01:18:40.853 --> 01:18:44.409
John Mack investigated
these stories of people
who said that this and this

1525
01:18:44.443 --> 01:18:48.275
happened to them.
and at least Mack.
as a psychiatrist.

1526
01:18:48.309 --> 01:18:52.279
was able to evaluate
their stories to the...

1527
01:18:52.313 --> 01:18:56.870
Couldn't prove that this
happened or didn't happen.
but at least could say that

1528
01:18:56.904 --> 01:19:00.943
these people were solid people
and were not mentally ill.

1529
01:19:02.565 --> 01:19:06.189
We interface with
whatever this is.

1530
01:19:06.224 --> 01:19:08.502
Contactees. abductees.

1531
01:19:08.536 --> 01:19:12.264
I think we can create
some of the phenomenon itself.

1532
01:19:12.299 --> 01:19:16.475
So I do believe that there are
certain individuals
on this planet

1533
01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:20.445
who are more in tune.
are more intuitive.

1534
01:19:20.478 --> 01:19:23.759
are more in touch
with the unseen world

1535
01:19:23.793 --> 01:19:25.312
than the seen world.

1536
01:19:25.346 --> 01:19:28.384
Some of us are able
to pierce the veil

1537
01:19:28.418 --> 01:19:31.282
and connect with whatever
is going on out there.

1538
01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:36.323
NARRATOR: Stunning new research
by Dr Gary Nolan.

1539
01:19:36.357 --> 01:19:38.981
has revealed a trait in
the human brain

1540
01:19:39.014 --> 01:19:42.018
that may make some people
more prone to abilities.

1541
01:19:42.053 --> 01:19:45.608
such as heightened intuition.
psychic abilities.

1542
01:19:45.642 --> 01:19:50.199
and possibly an ability
to communicate
in undeveloped manners.

1543
01:19:50.233 --> 01:19:51.510
such as telepathy.

1544
01:19:51.545 --> 01:19:55.652
We had MRIs of claimed
remote viewers.

1545
01:19:56.273 --> 01:19:58.690
high-end remote viewers.

1546
01:19:58.724 --> 01:20:03.452
and this area of their brain
lit up like a Christmas tree.

1547
01:20:03.487 --> 01:20:07.492
NARRATOR: The condition has
been observed in so-called
"Experiencers."

1548
01:20:07.526 --> 01:20:10.909
Nolan has detected
increased activity
and development

1549
01:20:10.943 --> 01:20:13.878
in a region of the brain
called the basal ganglia.

1550
01:20:13.912 --> 01:20:16.225
NOLAN: The thing that
got me really intrigued

1551
01:20:16.259 --> 01:20:20.987
was that we did have MRIs
from experiencers.

1552
01:20:21.023 --> 01:20:24.958
but these were
high functioning individuals
that we happened to notice

1553
01:20:24.992 --> 01:20:30.032
that an area of their brain.
had a density in it

1554
01:20:30.066 --> 01:20:33.068
that we first thought was
damaged because we were studying
damage at the moment.

1555
01:20:33.103 --> 01:20:37.108
But then we realized.
this is not damaged.
This is living tissue.

1556
01:20:37.142 --> 01:20:39.835
And that became sort of
a side discovery.

1557
01:20:39.869 --> 01:20:43.286
You're left then
with. frankly.
what was

1558
01:20:43.321 --> 01:20:46.048
an even less uniform
group of individuals

1559
01:20:46.082 --> 01:20:51.950
with such varied interactions.
Things that
we're talking to them.

1560
01:20:51.985 --> 01:20:55.609
things that they had
gotten close to and had
been damaged and harmed.

1561
01:20:55.643 --> 01:20:58.543
And there were a couple
of people in that group
who were harmed.

1562
01:20:58.577 --> 01:21:00.959
But of the remaining
individuals.

1563
01:21:00.994 --> 01:21:04.273
I would say that the majority
of them were not harmed.

1564
01:21:04.307 --> 01:21:09.623
This area of the brain.
that we came to the conclusion
at the time

1565
01:21:09.657 --> 01:21:11.452
was probably involved
in intuition.

1566
01:21:11.487 --> 01:21:13.799
when we actually
looked into it.

1567
01:21:13.834 --> 01:21:15.732
and then looked into
the literature.

1568
01:21:15.767 --> 01:21:17.355
believe it or not.
people were finding that

1569
01:21:17.389 --> 01:21:19.046
it had something to do
with intuition.

1570
01:21:20.013 --> 01:21:22.153
And that's the basal ganglia.

1571
01:21:22.187 --> 01:21:24.776
This area. the caudate putamen.

1572
01:21:24.809 --> 01:21:28.021
which is. you know.
by many neurophysiologist

1573
01:21:28.055 --> 01:21:29.505
called the brain
within the brain.

1574
01:21:29.539 --> 01:21:31.645
NARRATOR: What Dr. Nolan
has discovered

1575
01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:34.682
may represent a leap
in human evolution

1576
01:21:34.717 --> 01:21:38.065
or even a new variation
of Homo sapien.

1577
01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:43.657
You have to ask the question
"What kind of information

1578
01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:49.041
"is being perceived
and how is it
being translated into.

1579
01:21:49.076 --> 01:21:52.493
"let's say. traditional
neuro-physiologic pathways?"

1580
01:21:53.356 --> 01:21:56.394
We don't understand...

1581
01:21:56.428 --> 01:21:59.293
space time the way
we'd like to pretend we do.

1582
01:21:59.327 --> 01:22:05.851
And so. who is to say
that there is not some kind
of information transfer

1583
01:22:05.886 --> 01:22:08.751
that we just don't
necessarily yet appreciate.

1584
01:22:08.785 --> 01:22:11.581
but evolution has found
a way to latch onto.

1585
01:22:18.588 --> 01:22:21.281
NARRATOR: The people that
we've met since 2017

1586
01:22:21.315 --> 01:22:23.110
seemed to have
some genuine interest

1587
01:22:23.145 --> 01:22:27.080
in helping to make humanity
more aware of these realities.

1588
01:22:27.114 --> 01:22:31.014
Chris Mellon continues to work
quietly behind the scenes

1589
01:22:31.049 --> 01:22:34.327
to bring about an effective
means of disclosure.

1590
01:22:34.362 --> 01:22:36.916
Very much changing
within the government.

1591
01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:40.058
on the Hill
and the executive branch.

1592
01:22:40.093 --> 01:22:42.716
as well as you can see
with the media lately.

1593
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.925
It's becoming respectable
and legitimate.

1594
01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.549
and that's so crucial
to engaging more minds
and more energy.

1595
01:22:48.584 --> 01:22:50.689
and more resources
to getting to
the bottom of this.

1596
01:22:50.724 --> 01:22:52.484
NARRATOR: Lue Elizondo
seems to have put

1597
01:22:52.519 --> 01:22:54.659
everything on the line
since going public.

1598
01:22:54.693 --> 01:22:58.076
So if there's an issue where
the government is doing
something we don't want to

1599
01:22:58.111 --> 01:23:00.734
then it's up to us
as a people to change that.

1600
01:23:00.768 --> 01:23:03.633
But it doesn't have to be
an adversarial relationship.

1601
01:23:03.668 --> 01:23:07.499
I think where we go wrong is
that people often times look
at the government. they say.

1602
01:23:07.534 --> 01:23:09.501
"Oh. the government's bad.
the government's bad."

1603
01:23:09.536 --> 01:23:13.264
NARRATOR: His role in AATIP
has been challenged by the
Defense Intelligence Agency.

1604
01:23:13.298 --> 01:23:16.059
Lue fought back by hiring
one of the most effective

1605
01:23:16.094 --> 01:23:19.822
and well known
civil rights attorneys
in the field. Danny Sheehan.

1606
01:23:19.856 --> 01:23:25.172
I was contacted by Lue Elizondo
and asked to represent him

1607
01:23:25.207 --> 01:23:27.071
because he was upset

1608
01:23:27.105 --> 01:23:29.245
about the fact that the Pentagon

1609
01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:32.248
even after
the publication of this

1610
01:23:32.282 --> 01:23:35.424
on December 16th and 17th
of 2017.

1611
01:23:35.458 --> 01:23:40.567
there were officials inside
the Pentagon issuing
completely false statements.

1612
01:23:40.601 --> 01:23:43.052
still. saying.
"Yeah. there's no such thing

1613
01:23:43.087 --> 01:23:46.504
"as the Advanced Aerospace
Identification Program."

1614
01:23:46.538 --> 01:23:49.334
NARRATOR: Together.
they approached the
Inspector General

1615
01:23:49.369 --> 01:23:51.129
of the Defense
Intelligence Agency

1616
01:23:51.164 --> 01:23:55.375
to reverse the Pentagon's
failure to acknowledge
Elizondo's position.

1617
01:23:55.409 --> 01:24:00.414
When Elizondo started.
talking about this
phenomenon publicly.

1618
01:24:00.449 --> 01:24:04.591
you can see the Pentagon had
tremendous pushback against him.

1619
01:24:05.178 --> 01:24:06.179
They lied.

1620
01:24:06.213 --> 01:24:08.422
They said "No.
he didn't run such a program."

1621
01:24:08.457 --> 01:24:09.630
That was a lie.

1622
01:24:09.665 --> 01:24:11.701
They said AATIP
had nothing to do with UFOs.

1623
01:24:11.736 --> 01:24:13.945
-That was a lie.
-We were trying
at the same time.

1624
01:24:13.978 --> 01:24:17.017
trying to determine
what Lue can say

1625
01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:20.157
in light of his
security clearances.
you know. publicly.

1626
01:24:20.193 --> 01:24:24.887
Not long ago.
Elizondo supposedly
said to his attorney

1627
01:24:24.921 --> 01:24:27.027
that he had seen
a flying saucer in a hanger.

1628
01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:32.101
That gets out and
the stuff hits the fan.

1629
01:24:32.136 --> 01:24:34.862
And. you know.
Lue had to walk
that back too.

1630
01:24:34.897 --> 01:24:37.037
What did he do?
He said.
"Well. you know.

1631
01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:39.557
"I went to a hangar
that was designed

1632
01:24:39.591 --> 01:24:42.870
"to accommodate
exotic materials.
but I didn't see anything there.

1633
01:24:42.905 --> 01:24:46.874
"I never saw any intact craft."
He was like. very lawyerly

1634
01:24:46.909 --> 01:24:49.601
in how he said what he did
because he had to.

1635
01:24:49.636 --> 01:24:53.880
I guess I'm just
genetically pre-disposed
to not trusting government

1636
01:24:53.916 --> 01:24:56.884
and seeing it now. too.
it's just a joke.

1637
01:24:56.919 --> 01:24:57.851
It really is.

1638
01:24:59.749 --> 01:25:02.821
NARRATOR: MUFON.
The Mutual UFO Network

1639
01:25:02.856 --> 01:25:07.032
is the largest and oldest
UFO organization in the world.

1640
01:25:07.067 --> 01:25:10.691
After over 50 years.
MUFON is stronger than ever.

1641
01:25:11.796 --> 01:25:14.557
I'm Ron James.
It's March 11th 2022.

1642
01:25:14.592 --> 01:25:16.111
I'm here in front of
the White House.

1643
01:25:16.145 --> 01:25:19.459
It's been a historic week
for the UFO community
and for MUFON.

1644
01:25:19.493 --> 01:25:20.839
the Mutual UFO Network.

1645
01:25:20.874 --> 01:25:23.463
We have actually been taking
meetings all week long

1646
01:25:23.496 --> 01:25:27.674
with key members and staff
of the House and Senate
intelligence committees

1647
01:25:27.708 --> 01:25:29.572
regarding the UAP phenomenon.

1648
01:25:29.607 --> 01:25:32.127
We've been here
for three days now. four days.

1649
01:25:32.161 --> 01:25:35.992
and have met with about
10 different officials.

1650
01:25:36.027 --> 01:25:41.619
congressmen. representatives
staff and senators.

1651
01:25:41.653 --> 01:25:44.794
and we've really had
a tremendous welcome.

1652
01:25:44.829 --> 01:25:47.934
NARRATOR: Thousands of people
over 100 years or more.

1653
01:25:47.969 --> 01:25:51.835
have challenged
the official deception
around the UFO topic.

1654
01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:54.321
They have been ridiculed
and debunked.

1655
01:25:54.356 --> 01:25:57.013
Today. they are beginning
to be vindicated.

1656
01:25:57.048 --> 01:25:59.532
but still have not
accomplished their goal.

1657
01:25:59.568 --> 01:26:02.433
A total end to
the UFO cover-up.

1658
01:26:02.467 --> 01:26:05.850
There is no way to inform
the American people
writ large.

1659
01:26:05.884 --> 01:26:09.198
all 500 million of us.
and ensure that information

1660
01:26:09.233 --> 01:26:11.648
is not going to get into
the hands of
a foreign adversary.

1661
01:26:11.683 --> 01:26:14.169
Maybe it's that
there are some elements

1662
01:26:14.202 --> 01:26:17.275
of the technology
that has to be kept under wraps

1663
01:26:17.309 --> 01:26:21.624
or kept to a limited number
of people because

1664
01:26:21.659 --> 01:26:23.868
if you cross the wires.
bad things happen.

1665
01:26:23.902 --> 01:26:28.079
This is a version of disclosure.

1666
01:26:28.112 --> 01:26:29.907
But is it going to be
the real truth?

1667
01:26:29.943 --> 01:26:32.014
And. I mean. I don't care

1668
01:26:32.048 --> 01:26:34.016
about anything except
what the actual truth is.

1669
01:26:34.050 --> 01:26:35.776
So. we'll see
if they can get there.

1670
01:26:35.811 --> 01:26:38.538
They could say. for example.
down the road.

1671
01:26:38.572 --> 01:26:43.128
"Well. actually. yeah.
We have had a few reports
down the road.

1672
01:26:43.163 --> 01:26:45.683
"over the years.
but we kept it quiet because.

1673
01:26:45.717 --> 01:26:48.272
"honestly. we needed
to avoid public panic."

1674
01:26:48.306 --> 01:26:49.618
They'll say that.

1675
01:26:49.652 --> 01:26:54.347
At a societal level.
I believe that we are
completely ready

1676
01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:57.522
to incorporate this new reality.

1677
01:26:57.557 --> 01:27:02.077
and if the President
were to go on

1678
01:27:02.112 --> 01:27:05.565
the evening news today
and say. "My fellow Americans.

1679
01:27:05.599 --> 01:27:07.118
"people of the world.
we're not alone."

1680
01:27:07.152 --> 01:27:11.364
I think the reaction
would be sorta two-fold.

1681
01:27:11.398 --> 01:27:14.159
Obviously. there would be
a huge interest in it.

1682
01:27:14.193 --> 01:27:17.577
but actually there wouldn't
be panic in the streets.

1683
01:27:17.611 --> 01:27:21.166
So to be part of that journey.

1684
01:27:21.201 --> 01:27:25.895
to uncover and to show links
to this advanced civilization.

1685
01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:29.830
that would be a great honor.
because as a scientist.

1686
01:27:29.865 --> 01:27:32.108
you go where the data takes you.

1687
01:27:32.143 --> 01:27:35.905
And sometimes the data
takes you to places that
are uncomfortable.

1688
01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:38.391
But. hey. that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

1689
01:27:38.425 --> 01:27:40.600
Yeah. I just... You know.
I'm going to get hit on it.

1690
01:27:40.634 --> 01:27:43.568
They told me. They said.
"Man. Burchett you need to
cool this stuff out

1691
01:27:43.603 --> 01:27:49.402
"because it's gonna
hurt us at the polls."
But we'll see.

1692
01:27:51.852 --> 01:27:54.959
NARRATOR: We've shown
that even today
there is a narrative at work

1693
01:27:54.993 --> 01:28:00.102
that has been created to
manipulate public perception
about the UFO topic.

1694
01:28:00.136 --> 01:28:02.725
We are not alone
in the universe.

1695
01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:06.419
There are those
who have struggled
to keep this truth a secret.

1696
01:28:06.452 --> 01:28:10.077
But the proof of the deception
serves its own purpose

1697
01:28:10.112 --> 01:28:12.804
and tells us much more
than ever before.

1698
01:28:12.839 --> 01:28:15.219
I have good news
and I have bad news.

1699
01:28:15.255 --> 01:28:19.224
And the good news
is the government's
been telling you the truth.

1700
01:28:19.259 --> 01:28:22.883
The bad news is
the government's been
telling you the truth.

1701
01:28:22.918 --> 01:28:24.022
I mean. just look at Roswell.

1702
01:28:24.057 --> 01:28:25.886
There are no 509th
bomb group members left.

1703
01:28:25.921 --> 01:28:27.335
They're all dead.

1704
01:28:27.371 --> 01:28:30.546
So according to the government.
it's cover up complete.

1705
01:28:30.581 --> 01:28:32.928
All right. then what did I see
out there in that field?

1706
01:28:33.446 --> 01:28:34.826
Oh. that...

1707
01:28:37.001 --> 01:28:39.037
Why. that was a weather balloon.
