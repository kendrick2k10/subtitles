00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:13.361
Deep breath.

4
00:00:13.448 --> 00:00:15.537
There we go. Deep breath.

5
00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:17.104
There we go. there we go.

6
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:18.844
Okay...

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:20.629
okay.

8
00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:22.022
Good. very good.

9
00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:26.113
One last piece. one last piece.

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.810
Okay. great.

11
00:00:27.897 --> 00:00:29.072
Dr. Miller.
we're going to need your help.

12
00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:30.378
We've got
a dozen wounded. Captain.

13
00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:33.468
Apply pressure right here.

14
00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:35.513
You're doing well.
You're okay. hang in there.

15
00:00:36.253 --> 00:00:37.907
Help me turn him over. please.

16
00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:39.474
Help me turn him over.

17
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:40.562
Nice and easy.

18
00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.824
Oh. my God.

19
00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:44.044
Jeff.

20
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:45.349
Oh. my God. honey.

21
00:00:45.436 --> 00:00:47.177
Oh. what happened?

22
00:00:48.526 --> 00:00:49.658
Michelle...

23
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.400
...they put a bomb on me.

24
00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:55.794
Oh. my God.

25
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:58.188
Everybody. clear out!
There's a bomb!

26
00:00:58.275 --> 00:00:59.842
Go. go. go!Clear out. clear out!

27
00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.191
Michelle. you need to get out.

28
00:01:01.278 --> 00:01:04.107
I can fix this. I can fix this.

29
00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:05.587
Blue to ignite. red--

30
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.372
Honey. please. go.

31
00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:10.026
Somebody's got to be there
for Bobby.

32
00:01:10.113 --> 00:01:12.028
No. no. I am not leaving you.

33
00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:13.073
I love you.

34
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:15.858
No! No! No!

35
00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:41.884
It's okay. You got it.

36
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:44.191
It's arterial!
Gotta bypass the tourniquet!

37
00:01:44.278 --> 00:01:45.670
We need a clamp!
We need a clamp!

38
00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:47.411
Please...

39
00:01:47.498 --> 00:01:49.413
Shit. dropped it.
Hang in there. Hang in there.

40
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.545
It hurts!

41
00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:51.850
Fuck! Fuck!I know.

42
00:01:51.937 --> 00:01:53.461
Almost there. almost there.

43
00:01:53.548 --> 00:01:55.463
Push 50 milligrams
of Midazolam right now.

44
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.029
Quickly!

45
00:01:57.813 --> 00:01:59.206
BP is dropping. doctor.

46
00:01:59.293 --> 00:02:00.729
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

47
00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:01.991
You're not going anywhere.
Lower his head.

48
00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:05.473
You're not going anywhere. okay?
Hang in. hang in.

49
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.648
You're okay.

50
00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:08.171
Hang in there.

51
00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:09.477
Okay. okay.

52
00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:10.565
He's stabilizing.

53
00:02:11.783 --> 00:02:14.177
There you go. There you go.

54
00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.744
Thank you.

55
00:02:16.962 --> 00:02:18.529
Thank you.

56
00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:22.838
Hey. Frank.
How you doing. man?

57
00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:24.535
Hey. doc. you're in early.

58
00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:26.842
Yeah. giving my favorite doctor
the night off.

59
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:30.324
Hey.

60
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:31.499
Hey.

61
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.159
Just beating myself up
over here.

62
00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:42.205
I've been told
you saved his life.

63
00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:46.253
I dropped the clamp.
like. what...

64
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.517
Hey. it takes guts
to bypass a tourniquet.

65
00:02:50.344 --> 00:02:52.868
I don't know of any other doctor
that would have done that.

66
00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:55.958
Afghan Combat Training 101.

67
00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:58.874
"Think outside the box
because ISIS
thinks outside everything."

68
00:02:58.961 --> 00:03:00.571
Mm-hmm.

69
00:03:00.658 --> 00:03:03.531
But you have always had
ice in your veins.

70
00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:06.403
I suppose that's what cools
that big heart of yours.

71
00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:12.583
That patient
was lucky to have you.

72
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.675
You're going to be fine.

73
00:03:17.762 --> 00:03:20.374
You were the best doc I had
over there...

74
00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:22.158
and you are the best here.

75
00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:27.294
I appreciate you
bringing me on here.

76
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.819
One day at a time.

77
00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:32.560
One foot in front of the other.

78
00:03:32.647 --> 00:03:34.562
Nothing more than that.

79
00:03:36.564 --> 00:03:38.000
All right.

80
00:03:59.064 --> 00:04:00.892
Jeff! Oh. my God.

81
00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.809
Clear out! There's a bomb!
Clear out!

82
00:04:04.896 --> 00:04:06.855
Michelle. you need to leave.
Now!

83
00:04:06.942 --> 00:04:08.770
Honey. please. go.

84
00:04:08.857 --> 00:04:10.641
Somebody's gotta
be here for Bobby.

85
00:04:10.728 --> 00:04:12.817
I am not leaving.
I am not leaving.

86
00:04:12.904 --> 00:04:14.776
I am not leaving you. No! No!

87
00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:39.322
Surprise!

88
00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.846
Bobby. hey!

89
00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:46.808
You ready?Yeah. just about.

90
00:04:47.243 --> 00:04:48.853
Did Granny come in with you?

91
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.725
Just dropped me off.
Big day at the bingo hall.

92
00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:53.510
Oh. really?
Working her magic. huh?

93
00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:56.774
I have something for you.

94
00:04:57.601 --> 00:04:58.907
Take a seat.

95
00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:01.039
Eyes closed.Why?

96
00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:02.650
Just 'cause.

97
00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:05.740
No peeking.

98
00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:07.611
I'm not peeking.No peeking.

99
00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:09.265
Hands out.

100
00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:11.093
What could it be?

101
00:05:13.095 --> 00:05:14.618
A soccer ball?Ah. man!

102
00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:15.837
How could you tell?

103
00:05:15.924 --> 00:05:17.447
I don't know. how could I?

104
00:05:19.754 --> 00:05:21.321
Yes!

105
00:05:21.408 --> 00:05:23.975
But it's not my birthday
until tomorrow.

106
00:05:24.062 --> 00:05:25.542
I know. but...

107
00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.197
I figured we'd go downtown.
grab some dinner.

108
00:05:28.284 --> 00:05:30.417
and by the time we get home.
it might as well be.

109
00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:31.592
Why?

110
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:34.072
Are we going somewhere
after dinner?

111
00:05:35.422 --> 00:05:36.901
Look inside the scarf.

112
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.601
No way!
Tickets for tonight?

113
00:05:40.688 --> 00:05:41.689
Mm-hmm.

114
00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.692
I love you. Thanks!

115
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.306
All right. I'm gonna fill out
a quick report.

116
00:05:50.393 --> 00:05:51.829
I need you to hang
in the waiting area.

117
00:05:51.916 --> 00:05:53.222
I'll walk you out
and get you settled.

118
00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:56.138
Mom. I'm basically an adult.

119
00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:58.009
I think I know
where the waiting room is.

120
00:05:58.662 --> 00:06:01.796
You're right. you are.

121
00:06:01.883 --> 00:06:03.188
All right.
I'll be right there.

122
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.244
Special Agent McBride.
this is Agent Ellis.

123
00:06:15.331 --> 00:06:18.029
You are Ryan Ethan Quinn.

124
00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:21.555
Born 1991. Limerick. Ireland.

125
00:06:21.642 --> 00:06:23.557
Immigrated
to these United States

126
00:06:23.644 --> 00:06:26.473
with charming brother.
Sean James Quinn.

127
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.738
and the big Shillelagh himself.
Patrick "Big Boy" Quinn.

128
00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:33.393
patriarch of
this whole sordid mess

129
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.048
that is the
Quinn Gang Brotherhood.

130
00:06:37.135 --> 00:06:38.615
Quinn family.

131
00:06:38.702 --> 00:06:40.748
suspected of
seven counts of homicide.

132
00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:42.750
twelve counts of armed robbery.

133
00:06:42.837 --> 00:06:44.534
a list of jury tampering.

134
00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:46.623
trafficking. extortion charges.

135
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.277
tax evasion.

136
00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:50.279
Guess you're the unlucky one
to get caught.

137
00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:53.587
Caught?

138
00:06:53.674 --> 00:06:55.589
Or targeted
as a way to get to my father?

139
00:06:55.676 --> 00:06:59.331
Ryan. we know
you love your father.

140
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.290
you've made that
abundantly clear.

141
00:07:01.377 --> 00:07:03.335
but this family's going down.
whether you like it or not.

142
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.859
Now. if you help us

143
00:07:04.946 --> 00:07:06.643
provide evidence
against his business.

144
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.776
we could cut
a sweet deal for you

145
00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:09.951
and for your brother. Sean.

146
00:07:10.038 --> 00:07:11.343
and for your father.

147
00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:15.173
Now. you've tried
this sort of thing before.

148
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.741
this bargain.

149
00:07:17.828 --> 00:07:20.048
but it didn't work then.
it's not working now.

150
00:07:20.135 --> 00:07:22.006
My father runs
a clean operation.

151
00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:24.966
Now. I suggest
you give me that phone call

152
00:07:25.053 --> 00:07:27.229
so I can call
my fancy lawyer friends.

153
00:07:27.708 --> 00:07:29.231
You don't fool me. Quinn.

154
00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.974
Rumor has it
that "Big Daddy Paddy"

155
00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:36.325
has picked you and you alone
to run the enterprise.

156
00:07:37.021 --> 00:07:40.634
bypassing
your big brother. Sean.

157
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:43.027
Not to mention the fact
that we've leaked

158
00:07:43.114 --> 00:07:45.639
how cooperative
you're being with us.

159
00:07:45.726 --> 00:07:47.423
That's bollocks.

160
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.817
You think Sean
will believe that?

161
00:07:49.904 --> 00:07:51.296
You're fucking daft.

162
00:07:51.383 --> 00:07:53.168
I guess we'll see.

163
00:07:54.082 --> 00:07:55.779
Let's take him
to the Terminal building.

164
00:08:05.572 --> 00:08:06.747
Watch your step.

165
00:08:19.934 --> 00:08:22.937
Johnno. What's the craic?

166
00:08:23.024 --> 00:08:25.809
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fucking shit.

167
00:08:25.896 --> 00:08:27.071
All right.

168
00:08:27.158 --> 00:08:29.465
Sean. It's Johnno.

169
00:08:31.772 --> 00:08:33.774
Johnno. what's the story?

170
00:08:34.383 --> 00:08:36.777
Sean. the Feds grabbed Ryan.

171
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.214
They're moving him now.

172
00:08:39.301 --> 00:08:40.520
Fuck.

173
00:08:42.304 --> 00:08:44.741
Maybe this is
our opportunity.

174
00:08:44.828 --> 00:08:46.177
Watch your head.

175
00:08:47.135 --> 00:08:48.092
Are you tooled up?

176
00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:50.007
Yeah.

177
00:08:50.094 --> 00:08:52.532
You stay with him.
you keep your eye on him. yeah?

178
00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:54.011
All right. good luck.

179
00:09:03.107 --> 00:09:04.239
What's going on?

180
00:09:05.588 --> 00:09:06.894
The FBI have Ryan.

181
00:09:06.981 --> 00:09:08.112
Christ.

182
00:09:08.199 --> 00:09:09.723
Do you wanna call your dad?

183
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.464
No. I don't want
to call my fucking dad.

184
00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:15.119
Hey. lads. we have to go.

185
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.295
Come on. Danny.

186
00:09:19.602 --> 00:09:21.386
Come on. move it.
for fuck's sake.

187
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.352
It's not your first time
in cuffs. Quinn. relax.

188
00:09:30.439 --> 00:09:31.701
Fuck you.

189
00:09:35.357 --> 00:09:36.576
I'm just behind them.

190
00:09:36.663 --> 00:09:38.578
We're coming up
right behind you.

191
00:09:38.665 --> 00:09:40.405
Get ready to move in.
cut them off.

192
00:09:49.284 --> 00:09:50.851
What's he doing?

193
00:09:50.938 --> 00:09:52.069
Now.

194
00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:54.158
Veer left. veer left!

195
00:09:54.245 --> 00:09:56.030
Watch the fence.

196
00:09:59.947 --> 00:10:01.949
This is for you.
you fucking asshole.

197
00:10:02.036 --> 00:10:03.341
Cut them off.

198
00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:04.691
Jesus. got to be quick.

199
00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:09.826
Jesus...

200
00:10:13.438 --> 00:10:14.744
It's a fucking ambush!

201
00:10:15.876 --> 00:10:18.530
We got bulletproof glass.
it's okay. it's okay.

202
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.011
Stay down!

203
00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:23.840
Down! Down!

204
00:10:30.934 --> 00:10:32.109
Danny. cover!

205
00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:34.764
Fuck you. cunt.

206
00:10:36.287 --> 00:10:37.941
This is the FBI!
Drop your weapon!

207
00:10:40.465 --> 00:10:41.728
Fuck off!Drop your weapon!

208
00:10:41.815 --> 00:10:43.164
Get down!

209
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.568
Sean...

210
00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:06.709
I got them.

211
00:11:14.412 --> 00:11:16.023
Shit!

212
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.633
Fucking move. Johnno. Danny.
come on. let's go!

213
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.635
Where's my phone? Wow.

214
00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:23.552
Get me directions
to the nearest hospital.

215
00:11:24.118 --> 00:11:28.426
Calculating. Mercy Hospital.
Please proceed to the route.

216
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.473
Is that the birthday boy
I see?

217
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.040
Not yet. Think fast!

218
00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:34.606
Ho!

219
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.957
Rumor has it.
you made the under-12 team.

220
00:11:37.044 --> 00:11:38.262
I've been practicing.

221
00:11:38.349 --> 00:11:39.481
Hey. you two.

222
00:11:39.568 --> 00:11:41.918
Well. the hardest worker I know

223
00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:43.746
finally taking a night off.

224
00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:45.139
And for a soccer game.

225
00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:46.531
It's "football".

226
00:11:46.618 --> 00:11:48.098
A purist. I see.

227
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.710
Thanks again for tonight.

228
00:11:50.797 --> 00:11:51.754
I owe you one.

229
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:52.929
Not at all.

230
00:11:53.016 --> 00:11:54.801
Happy to cover.

231
00:11:54.888 --> 00:11:56.846
You all ready? Okay.

232
00:11:56.933 --> 00:11:58.021
Gotta sign out
and we're good to go.

233
00:11:58.108 --> 00:11:59.631
Okay.All right.

234
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.459
Come on. let's-- whoa!

235
00:12:01.546 --> 00:12:02.939
Got ya!

236
00:12:10.338 --> 00:12:12.383
Help. Medics!

237
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.777
FBI. We just got ambushed.

238
00:12:14.864 --> 00:12:17.345
My partner is shot
and so is our witness.

239
00:12:18.346 --> 00:12:20.000
Careful. Easy.Got him.

240
00:12:21.392 --> 00:12:23.177
Got him.

241
00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:25.092
Here. let me get
the cuffs off him. Here you go.

242
00:12:27.703 --> 00:12:28.965
Go. go. go. go. go.

243
00:12:29.052 --> 00:12:30.227
IV is Ready!

244
00:12:30.314 --> 00:12:31.576
Get them inside.

245
00:12:31.968 --> 00:12:33.665
Coming through.
coming through!

246
00:12:36.103 --> 00:12:37.452
Holy shit.

247
00:12:46.417 --> 00:12:47.636
Bobby. come here. please.

248
00:12:47.723 --> 00:12:49.159
What now?

249
00:12:50.595 --> 00:12:52.075
You guys. go. I've got this.

250
00:12:52.162 --> 00:12:53.642
Call Nurse Riley. please.

251
00:12:54.512 --> 00:12:55.644
What happened?

252
00:12:55.731 --> 00:12:57.559
I don't know. buddy.

253
00:12:57.646 --> 00:12:59.387
Maybe you should go help.
We're still early.

254
00:12:59.474 --> 00:13:00.867
We made birthday plans.

255
00:13:00.954 --> 00:13:02.172
What if they need you?

256
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.002
Kindest heart I know.
you know that?

257
00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:08.309
Just like your dad.

258
00:13:08.396 --> 00:13:09.745
Can I go play in the tunnels?

259
00:13:09.832 --> 00:13:11.791
No. You just stay right here.

260
00:13:11.878 --> 00:13:13.227
I won't be long. Copy?

261
00:13:13.314 --> 00:13:15.098
Copy.Okay.

262
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.201
Luck of the Irish.

263
00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:33.551
No luck in it
at all. gentlemen.

264
00:13:33.638 --> 00:13:38.469
It's just a magnificent talent
that the Lord blessed me with.

265
00:13:38.556 --> 00:13:40.341
Three in a row. Paddy.

266
00:13:40.428 --> 00:13:41.777
Gettin' dangerous.

267
00:13:41.864 --> 00:13:44.258
That was a hell of a shot.
wasn't it. huh?

268
00:13:44.345 --> 00:13:48.523
Now. that.
I can have a little of that. eh?

269
00:13:49.089 --> 00:13:50.264
Water of life.

270
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:51.700
Yeah. the water of life.

271
00:13:53.745 --> 00:13:55.878
Mm. Jonesy.

272
00:13:55.965 --> 00:13:57.793
Jonesy. I know what you want.

273
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.577
Here. look.

274
00:13:59.664 --> 00:14:01.579
Here. there. look at this.

275
00:14:01.666 --> 00:14:03.103
Here. here. here.

276
00:14:03.668 --> 00:14:06.933
Jonesy. oh. you're
an alcoholic doggy. Jonesy?

277
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.152
You're an alcoholic.
but I love ya.

278
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:24.776
Sean.

279
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.126
Dad.

280
00:14:26.213 --> 00:14:27.867
Dad?

281
00:14:27.954 --> 00:14:30.695
You only call me "Dad"
when you're in trouble. son.

282
00:14:30.782 --> 00:14:32.001
You're not in trouble. are ya?

283
00:14:32.088 --> 00:14:34.221
We have a problem.

284
00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:35.657
Oh?

285
00:14:35.744 --> 00:14:37.702
The FBI
took Ryan into custody.

286
00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:41.924
They have all his files.
everything on the business.

287
00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:43.534
Christ.

288
00:14:43.621 --> 00:14:45.841
We tried to get him out.
Things got messy.

289
00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:47.364
Dad...

290
00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:50.454
Ryan got shot.

291
00:14:50.541 --> 00:14:52.413
What are you
fooling saying to me?

292
00:14:55.198 --> 00:14:56.417
Sean?

293
00:14:57.418 --> 00:14:59.942
Tell me Ryan is alive.

294
00:15:00.682 --> 00:15:02.771
He is.

295
00:15:02.858 --> 00:15:03.903
He better be.

296
00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:06.949
Where'd they take him?

297
00:15:08.081 --> 00:15:09.386
They've taken him to The Mercy.

298
00:15:12.085 --> 00:15:15.958
Don't make another move
until I get there.

299
00:15:17.525 --> 00:15:19.483
How many bullets?

300
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.833
One in the neck.
Ruptured an artery
from what I can see.

301
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.923
Second patient
has one in the left hip

302
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:25.011
and one in the stomach.

303
00:15:25.098 --> 00:15:26.447
Wound is fairly large.

304
00:15:26.534 --> 00:15:27.622
Okay. they're both
bleeding out.

305
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.973
What are you doing here?
You got a game to catch.

306
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.583
You're understaffed.

307
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.411
And I took orders from Bobby.

308
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.283
Runs in the family. I see.

309
00:15:37.762 --> 00:15:40.461
All right. everyone.
let's prep OR 1.

310
00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:41.853
Let's get busy.

311
00:15:46.075 --> 00:15:47.642
He's stable.

312
00:15:47.729 --> 00:15:49.078
Okay. good.

313
00:15:49.165 --> 00:15:50.775
I think I got
the last bullet.

314
00:15:50.862 --> 00:15:52.081
What's his pressure?

315
00:15:52.168 --> 00:15:53.387
One thirty over 80.

316
00:15:53.474 --> 00:15:54.910
Come on. come on. come on.

317
00:15:54.997 --> 00:15:56.259
Easy does it.

318
00:15:59.088 --> 00:16:00.785
There you go.What is that?

319
00:16:00.872 --> 00:16:03.005
It might be
an exploding bullet.

320
00:16:03.092 --> 00:16:04.267
Be careful.

321
00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:07.183
Okay.

322
00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:13.363
Is everyone okay?

323
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.538
I'm okay.

324
00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:16.627
Yes. Sir. ambushed.

325
00:16:16.714 --> 00:16:18.194
It was the Quinn Gang.

326
00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:19.543
They had to have known
we were coming.

327
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:20.849
It was a complete shit show.

328
00:16:20.936 --> 00:16:23.112
Yeah. 1100. Sir.

329
00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:25.114
Approximately.
Under the Southbound overpass.

330
00:16:26.072 --> 00:16:30.250
I'm...I'm pretty sure our driver
took a fatal hit.

331
00:16:30.337 --> 00:16:33.688
Yep. okay. will do. All right.

332
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.387
Excuse me. Yeah.
I'm Special Agent Ellis. FBI.

333
00:16:37.474 --> 00:16:38.693
Are you with the ER team?

334
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.651
I'm Dr. Miller. yes.

335
00:16:40.738 --> 00:16:44.133
Hi. I'm the one that brought in
a couple of gunshot victims.

336
00:16:44.786 --> 00:16:46.135
Agent McBride.
he's the one with the gray hair.

337
00:16:46.222 --> 00:16:47.354
How's he doing?

338
00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:48.703
He's stable now.

339
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.705
Took a shot
to the anterior jugular.

340
00:16:50.792 --> 00:16:53.621
Wow. I mean. he's going
to be all right. though. right?

341
00:16:53.708 --> 00:16:55.623
Yes.Okay. good.

342
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.799
Oh. and what about
our asset. Ryan Quinn?

343
00:17:00.236 --> 00:17:01.672
Asset. huh?

344
00:17:02.195 --> 00:17:03.979
Hit pretty bad.

345
00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:07.809
Including an exploding bullet
wedged in his lower rib-cage.

346
00:17:07.896 --> 00:17:09.376
Exploded in our ER.

347
00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:11.595
Exploded?

348
00:17:11.682 --> 00:17:13.075
Jesus.

349
00:17:13.162 --> 00:17:15.686
You wanna tell me
what we're dealing with?

350
00:17:15.773 --> 00:17:18.733
I'm sorry. doc. it's not--

351
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.343
It's not something
I can talk about.

352
00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.432
It's a small hospital.
Agent Ellis.

353
00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:25.131
we're not really equipped
to deal with illegal ammunition.

354
00:17:25.218 --> 00:17:27.133
Look. I'm sorry. doc.

355
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.179
It's-- it's above my clearance
level to-- you know. to--

356
00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:33.182
You're a by-the-book
kinda guy. huh?

357
00:17:33.269 --> 00:17:34.792
I know the type.

358
00:17:34.879 --> 00:17:37.447
A type?
What's that supposed to mean?

359
00:17:38.709 --> 00:17:40.450
I know a rookie when I see one.

360
00:17:41.364 --> 00:17:43.279
Word of advice.

361
00:17:43.366 --> 00:17:45.238
Keep your head up.

362
00:17:45.325 --> 00:17:47.588
Clearance levels
don't stop bullets.

363
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.692
Oh. fuck.

364
00:18:05.954 --> 00:18:07.390
What are you gonna tell him?

365
00:18:07.477 --> 00:18:09.131
Not gonna say anything.

366
00:18:09.218 --> 00:18:11.220
Ryan was shot in the cross fire.
It was an accident.

367
00:18:13.701 --> 00:18:15.181
All right. Mick.

368
00:18:19.272 --> 00:18:20.795
You should have
come to me. son.

369
00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:23.102
You should have come to me
as soon as Ryan was taken.

370
00:18:23.189 --> 00:18:24.146
and you didn't. did ya?

371
00:18:24.233 --> 00:18:26.409
I know. it's my fault.

372
00:18:26.496 --> 00:18:29.717
You know how many times
I've had to clean up your mess?

373
00:18:29.804 --> 00:18:32.023
My dog's shites
are less numerous.

374
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.853
Put that weapon away!
Put that weapon away!

375
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.336
What do you think this is.
Chicago 1920s?

376
00:18:40.423 --> 00:18:42.382
You're making
a spectacle of yourself.

377
00:18:46.037 --> 00:18:48.910
I never liked hospitals.

378
00:18:48.997 --> 00:18:50.520
Too many people die in them.
Let's go.

379
00:18:50.607 --> 00:18:51.956
You stay here.

380
00:18:52.043 --> 00:18:53.132
What are you gonna do?

381
00:18:53.654 --> 00:18:55.960
I'm going to see your brother.

382
00:18:56.047 --> 00:18:59.355
The rest of ya. do nothing.

383
00:18:59.442 --> 00:19:02.837
Do nothing
until I assess the situation.

384
00:19:05.927 --> 00:19:07.276
Your father means well.

385
00:19:07.363 --> 00:19:08.843
Yeah. I'm sure he does. yeah.

386
00:19:11.933 --> 00:19:13.413
Hey. you. Billy the Kid.

387
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.110
Do you want a box
in the fucking mouth?

388
00:19:15.197 --> 00:19:17.112
Give me a fucking break.

389
00:19:17.199 --> 00:19:19.332
I'll give you a fucking break.
I'll break your fucking legs.

390
00:19:35.565 --> 00:19:37.393
Excuse me. sweetheart.

391
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.091
I'm looking
for Ryan Quinn's room.

392
00:19:42.964 --> 00:19:45.096
Ryan Quinn.

393
00:19:46.924 --> 00:19:48.448
Oh. I'm sorry. Sir.

394
00:19:48.535 --> 00:19:50.667
That's been flagged
as a private ward.

395
00:19:50.754 --> 00:19:52.103
No visitors.

396
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.627
No visitors?

397
00:19:53.714 --> 00:19:57.544
Well. I'm not a visitor.

398
00:19:57.631 --> 00:19:59.459
I'm his fucking father.

399
00:20:00.764 --> 00:20:03.419
Okay. I'm sorry. Mr. Quinn.

400
00:20:03.506 --> 00:20:05.769
There's a waiting room
around the corner

401
00:20:05.856 --> 00:20:06.988
and you're welcome to sit there.

402
00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:09.120
Oh. there's a waiting room.

403
00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:10.644
Yeah. I'm sure one
of the Trauma Doctors
will be out soon.

404
00:20:10.731 --> 00:20:12.167
Thank you.
around the corner.

405
00:20:12.254 --> 00:20:13.821
Thank you.

406
00:20:13.908 --> 00:20:15.170
Cunt.

407
00:20:26.834 --> 00:20:28.183
Hey.

408
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.055
Think fast. son.

409
00:20:32.361 --> 00:20:35.538
Whoa-ho!
Another five years.

410
00:20:35.625 --> 00:20:38.585
I'll have to pay good money
just to watch ya.

411
00:20:38.672 --> 00:20:39.934
Thanks.

412
00:20:41.196 --> 00:20:43.329
Should I take
a quiet look around now?

413
00:20:45.505 --> 00:20:47.420
No. stay.
Stay close-- for now.

414
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.860
You don't think
he's alive. do ya?

415
00:20:52.947 --> 00:20:54.296
No way he survived.

416
00:20:54.383 --> 00:20:56.167
We shot right at him.

417
00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:58.735
Fucking explosives
didn't work anyway.

418
00:20:59.388 --> 00:21:00.998
You know. I think Ryan
was put on this Earth

419
00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:02.739
just to fucking torment me.

420
00:21:23.238 --> 00:21:25.153
See you tomorrow. Dr. Miller.

421
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.850
Okay.

422
00:21:30.158 --> 00:21:31.855
Excuse me.

423
00:21:31.942 --> 00:21:34.858
Have you seen a little boy
around about 11 years old?

424
00:21:34.945 --> 00:21:36.947
He's got a soccer ball with him?

425
00:21:37.034 --> 00:21:39.385
I think you might find him

426
00:21:39.472 --> 00:21:41.604
dribbling his ball
down at the end of this hallway.

427
00:21:41.691 --> 00:21:43.693
Thank you.

428
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.522
You're a doctor. huh?

429
00:21:46.609 --> 00:21:48.742
I'm actually off-duty. Sir.

430
00:21:48.829 --> 00:21:51.571
Well. perhaps you can help me.
I can't seem to get any answers.

431
00:21:51.658 --> 00:21:54.574
I'm looking for my son.
Ryan Quinn.

432
00:21:54.661 --> 00:21:56.227
Your son?

433
00:21:58.447 --> 00:22:00.971
You're a very lucky man.
Mr. Quinn.

434
00:22:01.494 --> 00:22:03.496
We pulled two bullets
out of your boy.

435
00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:06.368
Two bullets?
Is he...

436
00:22:06.455 --> 00:22:08.675
He's heavily sedated
at the moment.

437
00:22:08.762 --> 00:22:10.981
but there doesn't seem to be
any permanent damage

438
00:22:11.068 --> 00:22:12.331
from what we can tell.

439
00:22:13.636 --> 00:22:15.551
That's wonderful news.

440
00:22:15.638 --> 00:22:18.206
You're an angel from God.
Can you take me to him?

441
00:22:18.293 --> 00:22:20.861
You'll have to clear that
with the authorities. Sir.

442
00:22:20.948 --> 00:22:22.471
Authorities?

443
00:22:22.558 --> 00:22:24.299
What happened?

444
00:22:24.386 --> 00:22:26.693
I'll make sure Dr. Terrence
comes to speak with you.

445
00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.434
Appreciate it.

446
00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:45.102
There you are.

447
00:22:45.189 --> 00:22:47.061
I thought I asked you to stay
in the waiting area?

448
00:22:47.148 --> 00:22:48.976
Sorry. I got bored.

449
00:22:49.063 --> 00:22:52.327
Are you ready for the
biggest hotdog money can buy?

450
00:22:52.414 --> 00:22:53.937
And ice-cream?

451
00:22:54.024 --> 00:22:55.809
Anything for my birthday boy.

452
00:22:55.896 --> 00:22:57.114
Let's go.

453
00:22:59.856 --> 00:23:01.510
That's some pretty nice kicks
you got.

454
00:23:01.597 --> 00:23:02.729
Thanks.Yeah.

455
00:23:05.862 --> 00:23:08.691
Wait. We got company.

456
00:23:10.911 --> 00:23:12.608
Afternoon. fellas.

457
00:23:12.695 --> 00:23:14.697
Hi. How's it going?Good. good.

458
00:23:14.784 --> 00:23:16.133
Y'all waiting for somebody?

459
00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.178
Yeah. shouldn't be too long.

460
00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:18.919
All right.

461
00:23:19.006 --> 00:23:20.224
You still gotta pay
for a parking pass. though.

462
00:23:20.311 --> 00:23:21.400
You a traffic cop?

463
00:23:21.487 --> 00:23:23.402
Hey. Johnny. cop on.

464
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.142
Sorry. never mind him.

465
00:23:25.229 --> 00:23:27.231
He's just--
he's a bit nervous.

466
00:23:27.318 --> 00:23:29.103
His girlfriend's having
their first baby.
you know how it is.

467
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:30.539
Right.

468
00:23:31.366 --> 00:23:32.759
Well. you still
gotta pay for parking.

469
00:23:32.846 --> 00:23:34.761
Not a bother.

470
00:23:34.848 --> 00:23:36.806
Take care. Bye.

471
00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:45.424
I don't like him
checking us out like that.

472
00:23:46.512 --> 00:23:48.122
Neither do I.

473
00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:51.168
Come on. let's make a move.

474
00:24:06.662 --> 00:24:08.534
We have some real sleazy types
out in the lot.

475
00:24:08.621 --> 00:24:11.275
I'm gonna call their plate in
to my guy.

476
00:24:11.362 --> 00:24:13.626
Always playing detective.
huh. Frank?

477
00:24:13.713 --> 00:24:15.410
Well. you know
my hunches. right?

478
00:24:16.803 --> 00:24:18.457
Hey. you.

479
00:24:18.544 --> 00:24:20.633
Put the phone down.
get up against the wall.

480
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.025
Johnno.Drop it. fucker.

481
00:24:22.112 --> 00:24:23.418
Okay.

482
00:24:23.505 --> 00:24:25.551
I said. drop it!Okay. okay.

483
00:24:27.683 --> 00:24:29.076
Don't fucking push it.

484
00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:32.383
Oh. my God.

485
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.692
Christ.

486
00:24:39.173 --> 00:24:40.566
Come on.

487
00:24:47.703 --> 00:24:49.488
What the fuck
are you morons doing?

488
00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:51.402
She was about to push
the panic button. Paddy.

489
00:24:53.361 --> 00:24:56.843
What part of do nothing
didn't you understand?

490
00:24:57.583 --> 00:24:59.193
All right.

491
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.325
move all these people
to the waiting area.

492
00:25:01.412 --> 00:25:02.979
Lock it down.

493
00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:05.329
You. guard the entrance.
No one in or out.

494
00:25:05.416 --> 00:25:07.375
You. make sure
the back is secure.

495
00:25:07.462 --> 00:25:08.855
Get that dead woman
out of there

496
00:25:08.942 --> 00:25:10.160
and clean up that blood.

497
00:25:10.247 --> 00:25:12.293
You. come with me.

498
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.424
Come on! Round them up.

499
00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:14.513
Paddy. please...

500
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.862
Fucking idiot.

501
00:25:15.949 --> 00:25:17.428
You heard him.
fucking move!

502
00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:20.344
Boy. what the fuck
you looking at?

503
00:25:30.485 --> 00:25:31.747
Where are we going?

504
00:25:31.834 --> 00:25:33.053
Somewhere safe.

505
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.228
Come on.

506
00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:37.710
Come in here.
Come in here.

507
00:25:37.797 --> 00:25:38.885
All right.

508
00:25:38.972 --> 00:25:39.973
I need you to wait in here.

509
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.757
Mom. no.

510
00:25:41.844 --> 00:25:44.499
Come on. Bobby. I need you
to be brave now. okay?

511
00:25:44.586 --> 00:25:45.848
This is the safest spot.

512
00:25:45.935 --> 00:25:47.458
In there?

513
00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:49.722
Come on. honey.
you've been brave before.

514
00:25:50.505 --> 00:25:52.376
Do you remember
when we were camping

515
00:25:52.463 --> 00:25:53.900
and I was scared of that snake?

516
00:25:53.987 --> 00:25:57.164
You wound up
the biggest. hardest kick.

517
00:25:57.251 --> 00:25:59.122
you didn't even bat an eye
before kicking it away.

518
00:25:59.209 --> 00:26:00.210
Do you remember that?

519
00:26:00.297 --> 00:26:02.430
Mom. I heard a gunshot.

520
00:26:02.517 --> 00:26:04.214
I know what they sound like.

521
00:26:05.346 --> 00:26:09.524
Listen. your mom's been
doing this a long time.

522
00:26:09.611 --> 00:26:12.048
I am not going to let
anything happen to you.

523
00:26:15.182 --> 00:26:17.488
Stay in here. stay quiet.

524
00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:19.142
and we'll get
out of this together.

525
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.232
Dad'll watch over you.

526
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:25.105
That's my man.

527
00:26:26.062 --> 00:26:27.455
Stay quiet.

528
00:26:27.542 --> 00:26:28.978
I won't be long. okay?

529
00:26:30.371 --> 00:26:31.502
Love you.

530
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.982
I love you. too.

531
00:26:40.337 --> 00:26:41.861
Please. please.
it was an accident.

532
00:26:41.948 --> 00:26:43.297
I didn't mean to.

533
00:26:43.384 --> 00:26:44.472
Please. please.Shut the fuck up.

534
00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:45.995
Paddy. please...

535
00:26:46.082 --> 00:26:51.174
Liam. Grab him.

536
00:26:51.261 --> 00:26:54.264
I don't know what ears are for
if you don't use them.

537
00:26:55.048 --> 00:26:56.440
You want to play with your gun?

538
00:26:57.659 --> 00:26:59.269
Here's the consequence.

539
00:27:14.023 --> 00:27:16.069
Ah. fuck!

540
00:27:16.156 --> 00:27:19.420
Next time
use the other ear to listen.

541
00:27:19.507 --> 00:27:22.423
Or I'll cut that one off. too!

542
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.990
You hear me now?

543
00:27:30.257 --> 00:27:31.519
Good man. Paddy.

544
00:27:36.089 --> 00:27:37.394
Here. sit.

545
00:27:37.481 --> 00:27:39.222
Sit. Here. have a seat.
Sit down.

546
00:27:40.049 --> 00:27:41.355
Over here.

547
00:27:41.442 --> 00:27:43.836
Clean him up.
You. clean him up.

548
00:27:43.923 --> 00:27:45.489
Clean him up.

549
00:27:46.273 --> 00:27:47.578
Quickly.

550
00:27:49.537 --> 00:27:51.582
Good afternoon. folks.

551
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.889
Don't mind him.

552
00:27:53.976 --> 00:27:57.806
Now. I'm going to speak
very slowly and clearly
for everyone.

553
00:27:57.893 --> 00:27:59.982
because people say sometimes

554
00:28:00.069 --> 00:28:02.028
that it might be hard
to understand me

555
00:28:02.115 --> 00:28:03.246
with my Irish accent.

556
00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:05.858
So. listen up carefully.

557
00:28:05.945 --> 00:28:08.121
so there's
no misunderstandings...

558
00:28:08.948 --> 00:28:10.645
and no one gets hurt. see?

559
00:28:12.995 --> 00:28:15.128
Now. can anyone
please tell me

560
00:28:15.606 --> 00:28:18.609
where my son. Ryan Quinn.
is being kept?

561
00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:21.003
You tell me.

562
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.398
we will get him.
and be on our merry way.

563
00:28:24.485 --> 00:28:25.965
Simple as that.

564
00:28:28.489 --> 00:28:29.795
Anyone?

565
00:28:30.926 --> 00:28:32.058
I can.

566
00:28:33.668 --> 00:28:36.410
I worked on him.
I know where he is.

567
00:28:36.497 --> 00:28:37.890
Stand up.

568
00:28:39.979 --> 00:28:42.808
Thank you. thank you. kind Sir.

569
00:28:43.634 --> 00:28:45.506
You must be a father. huh?

570
00:28:47.595 --> 00:28:48.727
Speak up.

571
00:28:49.858 --> 00:28:51.294
I have a daughter.

572
00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:52.513
Beautiful.

573
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.688
How old?

574
00:28:53.775 --> 00:28:55.081
Almost 14.

575
00:28:55.821 --> 00:28:57.823
Oh. a teenager.

576
00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.476
Wonderful.

577
00:28:59.563 --> 00:29:01.957
So you understand
why I need to find my son.

578
00:29:02.566 --> 00:29:03.916
Yes.

579
00:29:08.964 --> 00:29:11.445
I just don't want anyone
unnecessarily hurt.

580
00:29:14.448 --> 00:29:16.667
I don't want
to see anyone hurt.

581
00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:21.324
Take me to him.

582
00:29:25.198 --> 00:29:26.765
Sean.Yeah.

583
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:34.207
No one move. no one talk.

584
00:29:37.558 --> 00:29:38.820
Danny.

585
00:29:39.473 --> 00:29:41.257
Christ. you okay?

586
00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:44.695
Jesus.

587
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.553
Where is he?

588
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.120
He was here.

589
00:30:21.776 --> 00:30:23.343
I don't see him.

590
00:30:27.651 --> 00:30:30.872
I assure you. he was here.
with an FBI agent.

591
00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:32.526
What agent?

592
00:30:33.614 --> 00:30:36.617
Ellis. Agent Ellis.

593
00:30:36.704 --> 00:30:38.227
They all came in together.

594
00:30:42.971 --> 00:30:45.495
He's telling the truth.

595
00:30:45.582 --> 00:30:47.497
How the fuck do you know?

596
00:30:47.584 --> 00:30:49.848
Because I know.

597
00:30:51.414 --> 00:30:52.633
Do ya?

598
00:31:07.517 --> 00:31:09.171
What ya doing?

599
00:31:09.258 --> 00:31:11.652
That's the little prick
that nicked Ryan.

600
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.403
What the hell. Sean?

601
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.839
What did you do?

602
00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:28.799
He's responsible
for my little brother
being in here.

603
00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:30.801
You're both responsible.

604
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:32.803
Will you please
stop killing people?

605
00:31:33.979 --> 00:31:36.677
Fuck him.
He was dead anyway.

606
00:31:43.075 --> 00:31:44.424
Fuck.

607
00:31:46.774 --> 00:31:48.254
You tried.

608
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:49.646
Let's go.

609
00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:55.348
Liam. the Feds moved Ryan.

610
00:31:55.435 --> 00:31:57.002
Send the boys out to find him.

611
00:31:57.089 --> 00:31:58.481
You got it. Paddy.

612
00:31:59.526 --> 00:32:02.703
Search every floor.
every fucking room.

613
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.139
Come on.
let's find Ryan.

614
00:32:04.226 --> 00:32:05.575
Come on. then!

615
00:32:06.272 --> 00:32:08.230
Watch the bag. lad.

616
00:32:08.317 --> 00:32:09.884
Good man.

617
00:32:34.648 --> 00:32:36.041
What the fuck? Jesus Christ.

618
00:32:36.128 --> 00:32:38.957
Jesus Christ. they killed him.

619
00:34:07.088 --> 00:34:08.872
For Christ's sake.

620
00:34:09.873 --> 00:34:11.353
You could've
gotten yourself shot.

621
00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.181
You see anything?

622
00:34:13.268 --> 00:34:14.574
No.

623
00:34:15.792 --> 00:34:17.359
Still can't believe
Paddy did that.

624
00:34:17.446 --> 00:34:20.884
Oi. keep your mouth shut.

625
00:34:20.971 --> 00:34:22.538
Danny's a fucking idiot.

626
00:34:22.625 --> 00:34:24.236
Takes too much after Sean.

627
00:34:30.198 --> 00:34:32.766
Easy.

628
00:34:32.853 --> 00:34:34.507
That's my fucking cousin.

629
00:34:35.377 --> 00:34:37.162
We're all family at this point.

630
00:34:37.771 --> 00:34:41.209
You want to do well by Danny?
By yourself?

631
00:34:41.296 --> 00:34:43.559
You fucking
better listen to Paddy.

632
00:34:43.646 --> 00:34:45.039
Understood?

633
00:35:02.665 --> 00:35:04.145
Jesus. Frank.

634
00:35:04.232 --> 00:35:05.538
They shot Shannon.

635
00:35:06.539 --> 00:35:07.844
Oh. my God.

636
00:35:07.931 --> 00:35:09.411
I gotta show you something.

637
00:35:21.554 --> 00:35:23.295
Huh?

638
00:35:23.382 --> 00:35:24.861
Those are the hostages.

639
00:35:24.948 --> 00:35:26.341
Huh.

640
00:35:26.428 --> 00:35:27.603
Agent Ellis.

641
00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:28.909
Where is that?

642
00:35:28.996 --> 00:35:30.171
Third-floor storage area.

643
00:35:30.258 --> 00:35:31.520
Been abandoned for decades.

644
00:35:31.607 --> 00:35:33.348
Cut the feed to the monitors.

645
00:35:33.435 --> 00:35:35.437
The monitors? Why?

646
00:35:35.524 --> 00:35:37.526
I don't need them
knowing where I am.

647
00:35:37.613 --> 00:35:39.180
Okay.

648
00:35:54.674 --> 00:35:57.981
Holy shit. Some doctor.

649
00:35:59.026 --> 00:36:01.028
Skills from a past life.

650
00:36:01.115 --> 00:36:02.725
What. as Wonder Woman?

651
00:36:02.812 --> 00:36:04.553
Tie him up.

652
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.164
And cut those wires.

653
00:36:06.251 --> 00:36:07.687
Yeah. I'm on it.

654
00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:25.487
Wait. wait.

655
00:36:33.756 --> 00:36:35.193
Don't shoot!

656
00:36:35.976 --> 00:36:38.587
A Clown. Get up.

657
00:36:39.458 --> 00:36:41.938
Come with me. Come with me.

658
00:36:43.679 --> 00:36:47.683
Move. Come on now.
Move. Move.

659
00:36:51.339 --> 00:36:54.299
Clown--
You used to love clowns.

660
00:36:54.386 --> 00:36:55.778
Still do.

661
00:36:55.865 --> 00:36:57.824
That's why I have
five of them working for me.

662
00:36:59.565 --> 00:37:02.611
Everybody's cool and calm.
Good job.

663
00:37:04.396 --> 00:37:06.093
Hello. big ears.

664
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:12.055
Now. listen up.

665
00:37:12.142 --> 00:37:15.015
It's been a long time
since I've taken a life.

666
00:37:15.102 --> 00:37:16.582
I prefer to leave it to God
these days.

667
00:37:16.669 --> 00:37:18.410
but I am getting
fucking desperate.

668
00:37:18.497 --> 00:37:20.629
I need to find my son.

669
00:37:20.716 --> 00:37:23.066
I need someone to come with me

670
00:37:23.153 --> 00:37:24.677
who knows the ins and outs

671
00:37:24.764 --> 00:37:26.635
of the architecture
of this building.

672
00:37:28.594 --> 00:37:30.160
Nobody?

673
00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:32.946
What the?

674
00:37:33.033 --> 00:37:34.600
Jesus fucking wept.

675
00:37:42.956 --> 00:37:44.958
Let's go! Move. move!

676
00:38:00.016 --> 00:38:03.411
This is Agent Duncan Jones
of the FBI.

677
00:38:03.498 --> 00:38:06.936
I would like to speak
to whomever is in charge here.

678
00:38:07.633 --> 00:38:09.939
You. female nurse.
stand up. come with me.

679
00:38:10.026 --> 00:38:11.289
Now.

680
00:38:12.377 --> 00:38:14.204
Sean?

681
00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:16.206
I'm going to talk
to the cops. Paddy.

682
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:18.426
Unless you want
to show your face.

683
00:38:54.854 --> 00:38:56.421
The fuck?

684
00:39:21.837 --> 00:39:23.230
Ellis?

685
00:39:26.233 --> 00:39:27.887
Ellis. it's Dr. Miller.

686
00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:30.672
Agent Ellis?

687
00:39:30.759 --> 00:39:32.892
Psst. In here.

688
00:39:38.027 --> 00:39:40.421
Ellis.Yeah. in here.

689
00:39:40.508 --> 00:39:42.118
What are you doing?

690
00:39:42.205 --> 00:39:44.077
I had to move him.
they were going to kill him.

691
00:39:44.164 --> 00:39:46.296
They killed McBride.

692
00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:47.950
Yeah.I'm sorry.

693
00:39:48.037 --> 00:39:50.518
They just unplugged
his life support.

694
00:39:50.605 --> 00:39:51.911
just ripped it right off of him.

695
00:39:51.998 --> 00:39:53.478
I was fine with my desk job.

696
00:39:53.565 --> 00:39:55.436
You know.
they said you want action. huh?

697
00:39:55.523 --> 00:39:57.177
You want to make a difference.

698
00:39:57.264 --> 00:39:58.657
go into the field
with an easy first assignment.

699
00:39:58.744 --> 00:39:59.919
Easy. my ass!

700
00:40:00.006 --> 00:40:01.790
Ellis...My partner's dead!

701
00:40:01.877 --> 00:40:03.401
I should have been there.
I should have done something.

702
00:40:03.488 --> 00:40:05.403
Agent Ellis. I need you
to get it together.

703
00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.535
I'm sorry about your partner.

704
00:40:07.622 --> 00:40:09.363
but right now.
they are searching for Ryan.

705
00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.192
and they are not going to stop
until they find him.

706
00:40:12.279 --> 00:40:15.064
What--
what happened?

707
00:40:15.151 --> 00:40:16.892
The meds are wearing off.

708
00:40:16.979 --> 00:40:18.198
I'm gonna find him something.

709
00:40:18.285 --> 00:40:20.026
Just... stay here.

710
00:40:25.118 --> 00:40:27.381
Fucking move.

711
00:40:27.468 --> 00:40:29.296
Now. I'm going to tell you
one last time.

712
00:40:29.383 --> 00:40:31.211
you're going to do
exactly as I tell you to do.

713
00:40:31.298 --> 00:40:32.560
or I'm going to put a bullet
in your fucking head.

714
00:40:32.647 --> 00:40:34.170
Open it.

715
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.916
Hey. you! Can you hear me?

716
00:40:41.003 --> 00:40:43.963
I want you to listen
very carefully!

717
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:47.880
If any of you make a move
towards this building.

718
00:40:47.967 --> 00:40:50.273
I will ice pick the spines

719
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.406
of every fucking hostage
in here!

720
00:40:52.493 --> 00:40:54.843
Do you understand me?

721
00:40:55.322 --> 00:40:56.845
I understand.

722
00:40:56.932 --> 00:40:59.457
Nobody has to die. okay?

723
00:41:00.066 --> 00:41:01.850
So let's work together here.

724
00:41:02.721 --> 00:41:04.462
You just tell me
what you want...

725
00:41:04.549 --> 00:41:06.855
and we'll do our best to comply.

726
00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:11.077
I want your men
to back the fuck up!

727
00:41:11.164 --> 00:41:15.037
Me and my family want
to leave here in one piece!

728
00:41:15.124 --> 00:41:18.911
How we leave everyone else
is entirely up to you!

729
00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:22.044
We'll be in touch.

730
00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:29.965
Sir. that's Sean Quinn.
Patrick Quinn's eldest son.

731
00:41:30.052 --> 00:41:33.360
I know who the fuck that is.

732
00:41:33.447 --> 00:41:34.796
Goddammit.

733
00:41:51.378 --> 00:41:52.945
You think you're really
fucking smart. don't you?

734
00:41:59.647 --> 00:42:00.866
Don't move.

735
00:42:00.953 --> 00:42:02.520
Drop it. Now!

736
00:42:06.219 --> 00:42:09.309
You come to shoot?
Shoot. Don't talk.

737
00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.533
Thanks for the advice.

738
00:42:18.448 --> 00:42:19.711
You okay?

739
00:42:19.798 --> 00:42:21.364
Yeah. it's just a graze.

740
00:42:23.279 --> 00:42:24.716
That was my da's man.

741
00:42:24.803 --> 00:42:26.456
What the fuck did you just do?

742
00:42:27.457 --> 00:42:29.938
Johnno. what is it?

743
00:42:30.025 --> 00:42:31.331
I'll check it out. Boss.

744
00:42:31.418 --> 00:42:32.767
Good man.

745
00:42:34.203 --> 00:42:36.292
We gotta move.

746
00:42:36.379 --> 00:42:37.903
I think I'm bleeding.

747
00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:47.869
"Cut the wires." she says.
"It'll be easy." she says.

748
00:42:47.956 --> 00:42:50.393
I don't know
which wires to cut.

749
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.700
Yipee-ky-yay.

750
00:42:58.358 --> 00:42:59.577
Ah. shit.

751
00:43:02.014 --> 00:43:05.060
Danny. see what that is.

752
00:43:05.147 --> 00:43:06.453
Paddy. I...

753
00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:09.282
I don't feel so good.

754
00:43:09.369 --> 00:43:10.849
It's an ear.

755
00:43:10.936 --> 00:43:13.416
You got the rest of your body.
Move it.

756
00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:19.945
Go. go. go!

757
00:43:24.297 --> 00:43:25.951
Hey. asshole!

758
00:43:26.038 --> 00:43:28.214
That's no way
to start a negotiation!

759
00:43:28.301 --> 00:43:31.304
We're just
following protocol. Sean.

760
00:43:32.435 --> 00:43:34.524
Now. help us out here.

761
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:36.614
Why don't you
just let the lady go?

762
00:43:36.701 --> 00:43:39.747
Fuck you
and fuck your protocol!

763
00:43:40.139 --> 00:43:41.880
I have enough C4 in here

764
00:43:41.967 --> 00:43:44.143
to blow this whole
fucking place to hell!

765
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:46.711
Do not think I will not use it!

766
00:43:46.798 --> 00:43:50.105
I won't hesitate.
not for a fucking second.

767
00:43:50.192 --> 00:43:51.324
I hear you.

768
00:43:51.411 --> 00:43:52.804
Now. listen to me.

769
00:43:52.891 --> 00:43:55.676
No one has to die. okay?

770
00:43:58.766 --> 00:43:59.985
Fuck!

771
00:44:03.292 --> 00:44:05.425
Gimme an update.

772
00:44:05.512 --> 00:44:08.036
Just doin' the rounds. Sean.

773
00:44:08.123 --> 00:44:09.908
Still haven't seen anyone.

774
00:44:09.995 --> 00:44:11.561
You all right. Danny?

775
00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:13.825
All right?

776
00:44:13.912 --> 00:44:16.697
Your dad just cut
my fucking ear off.

777
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:19.482
Are you listening now?

778
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.224
That's what happens

779
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:25.053
to little boys who don't do
what they're fucking told.

780
00:44:31.103 --> 00:44:32.626
Children. huh?

781
00:44:49.338 --> 00:44:51.036
We meet again.

782
00:44:51.123 --> 00:44:52.211
I know this looks bad.

783
00:44:52.298 --> 00:44:54.039
but I was just. you know...

784
00:44:54.604 --> 00:44:55.736
I'll shut up.

785
00:44:55.823 --> 00:44:56.998
You're gonna come with me.

786
00:44:57.085 --> 00:44:58.434
I'm going to come with you.

787
00:45:06.007 --> 00:45:07.313
What do we have here?

788
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:11.012
The Quinns have men
at all the exits.

789
00:45:11.099 --> 00:45:12.448
Ambulance Bay. as well.

790
00:45:12.535 --> 00:45:13.841
All guarded.

791
00:45:18.019 --> 00:45:19.455
Fuck me.

792
00:45:20.456 --> 00:45:21.849
Take a deep breath.
It's going to sting.

793
00:45:21.936 --> 00:45:23.242
Breathe in.

794
00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:25.331
Good.
There you go.

795
00:45:25.418 --> 00:45:27.028
Ah. fuck.

796
00:45:27.115 --> 00:45:30.640
So. uh. where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

797
00:45:33.295 --> 00:45:35.297
Served two tours
in Afghanistan.

798
00:45:36.646 --> 00:45:38.083
Saw more
than anyone should.

799
00:45:39.214 --> 00:45:41.086
Afghanistan. huh?

800
00:45:41.173 --> 00:45:42.740
Well. thank you
for your service.

801
00:45:45.917 --> 00:45:47.396
It'll freeze up
in a few minutes.

802
00:45:47.483 --> 00:45:49.790
You're lucky to be alive.

803
00:45:49.877 --> 00:45:51.923
Yeah. tell that
to my brother.

804
00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:53.315
He's the one who shot me.

805
00:45:53.402 --> 00:45:55.404
Your brother?

806
00:45:55.491 --> 00:45:56.884
Yeah. welcome
to the Quinn family.

807
00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.408
What. you've been an FBI agent
for two weeks now

808
00:45:59.495 --> 00:46:00.932
and you know all about
me and my family?

809
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:07.852
My dad wants me to take over
the family business.

810
00:46:07.939 --> 00:46:09.331
Sean's fucking livid.

811
00:46:10.855 --> 00:46:12.117
So he shot you?

812
00:46:12.204 --> 00:46:14.772
My brother's
a fucking loonie.

813
00:46:14.859 --> 00:46:17.035
I was never gonna
take over without him.

814
00:46:17.122 --> 00:46:19.689
Sean's smart. I need him.

815
00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.996
Yeah. Well. it's too bad.

816
00:46:22.083 --> 00:46:23.955
because he's going to spend
the rest of his fucking life
in prison

817
00:46:24.042 --> 00:46:26.653
for murdering Federal Agents.
along with your old man.

818
00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.046
who's been aiding and abetting
his every move.

819
00:46:28.133 --> 00:46:29.395
My old man
has nothing to do with it.

820
00:46:30.048 --> 00:46:32.615
This is Sean's mess.
and if he was here--

821
00:46:32.702 --> 00:46:33.878
If he was here?

822
00:46:33.965 --> 00:46:35.314
What the fuck
do you think this is?

823
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:36.881
He's here looking for you.

824
00:46:36.968 --> 00:46:38.665
along with his gang
of fucking henchmen.

825
00:46:38.752 --> 00:46:40.449
Then you need
to let me talk to him.

826
00:46:40.536 --> 00:46:43.496
The only way out of this
is to get me to my dad.

827
00:46:43.583 --> 00:46:45.367
You don't think
he'll come looking for Mick?

828
00:46:45.454 --> 00:46:46.586
The man she just killed?

829
00:46:46.673 --> 00:46:48.153
It was self-defense.

830
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.589
I had to shoot him.
he was coming at me.

831
00:46:49.676 --> 00:46:50.982
I know.

832
00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:52.592
I saw that.

833
00:46:52.679 --> 00:46:54.289
But Sean's only gonna
use this against us.

834
00:46:54.376 --> 00:46:56.074
Oh. my God.

835
00:46:56.161 --> 00:46:57.597
You know what?
Listen to me carefully here.

836
00:46:57.684 --> 00:46:58.903
There's no way in hell
I'm letting you near them.

837
00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:00.121
You understand that?

838
00:47:00.208 --> 00:47:02.123
There's no fucking way.

839
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:03.516
Then they will torture and kill
everyone in this hospital

840
00:47:03.603 --> 00:47:06.606
without remorse
until they find me.

841
00:47:06.693 --> 00:47:07.999
On that I give you my word.

842
00:47:21.969 --> 00:47:23.623
All right.
what am I looking at?

843
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:26.582
Closed-circuit video feed
from inside the hospital.

844
00:47:27.192 --> 00:47:28.454
That's Agent Ellis.

845
00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:30.021
And that's Ryan Quinn. Sir.

846
00:47:31.196 --> 00:47:33.807
Wait. Who is she?

847
00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:38.812
Move. Move.

848
00:47:38.899 --> 00:47:40.727
Sean?Johnno.

849
00:47:40.814 --> 00:47:43.686
Remember this prick?

850
00:47:43.773 --> 00:47:46.602
Someone also took out
one of Paddy's guys--

851
00:47:46.689 --> 00:47:48.039
and I can't get ahold of Mick.

852
00:47:48.126 --> 00:47:50.302
Well. I didn't do anything.
I swear.

853
00:47:51.738 --> 00:47:53.218
Stand over by the wall.

854
00:48:03.706 --> 00:48:05.012
Are you a Fed?

855
00:48:10.757 --> 00:48:12.367
I'm gonna ask you...

856
00:48:12.454 --> 00:48:14.630
once.

857
00:48:14.717 --> 00:48:16.023
Where's my brother?

858
00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:19.157
I don't know. okay.
I promise.

859
00:48:21.072 --> 00:48:22.334
I also found these.

860
00:48:24.118 --> 00:48:25.946
Maps of the hospital.

861
00:48:30.211 --> 00:48:31.647
Keep this to yourself.

862
00:48:32.083 --> 00:48:33.432
All right. Boss.

863
00:48:37.218 --> 00:48:38.567
What the fuck's the plan?

864
00:48:39.655 --> 00:48:42.267
Take the back stairs
down to the boiler room.

865
00:48:42.354 --> 00:48:43.833
If his brother's
coming after him.

866
00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:45.139
it's the safest place to be.

867
00:48:45.226 --> 00:48:46.662
Hang onto this.

868
00:48:49.013 --> 00:48:50.362
What are you gonna do?

869
00:48:52.581 --> 00:48:54.061
What I swore I wouldn't.

870
00:48:56.281 --> 00:48:57.891
What you got for me. Tim?

871
00:49:00.111 --> 00:49:01.808
Captain Michelle Miller.

872
00:49:01.895 --> 00:49:04.202

Her second tour.

00:49:14.734 --> 00:49:17.215
before providing countermeasures
at the Bagram Air Base attack.

878
00:49:19.521 --> 00:49:21.784
She was there during
an insurgent attack in Kandahar.

879
00:49:21.871 --> 00:49:23.308
where her husband...

880
00:49:23.395 --> 00:49:24.918
late husband...

881
00:49:25.005 --> 00:49:26.485
Jeffrey Miller.

882
00:49:26.572 --> 00:49:28.617
an explosive ordnance
disposal specialist.

883
00:49:28.704 --> 00:49:30.837
was killed
on his third tour of duty.

884
00:49:31.794 --> 00:49:33.405
She survived the attack.
herself.

885
00:49:37.278 --> 00:49:39.106
Jesus.

886
00:49:40.455 --> 00:49:42.196
Yeah. That's her.

887
00:49:42.283 --> 00:49:43.981
Looks like we've got
some help on the inside.

888
00:49:44.633 --> 00:49:46.331
Ma'am.
we've got activity on the roof.

889
00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:11.399
Let's do everything we can
to help that soldier.

890
00:50:11.486 --> 00:50:12.835
Yes. Sir.

891
00:50:37.251 --> 00:50:38.687
Move.

892
00:50:38.774 --> 00:50:40.472
Sit him down there. Johnno.

893
00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:41.516
On the fucking ground.
You know how it is.

894
00:50:41.603 --> 00:50:43.605
Don't fuckin' look at me...

895
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.869
Any sign of him. Da?

896
00:50:48.915 --> 00:50:50.047
What the...

897
00:50:51.961 --> 00:50:53.137
Fuck.

898
00:50:54.442 --> 00:50:55.835
Sean.

899
00:50:57.619 --> 00:50:58.794
Danny. what's the story?

900
00:50:58.881 --> 00:51:00.666
Mick's been shot.

901
00:51:00.753 --> 00:51:02.015
He's dead.

902
00:51:07.194 --> 00:51:09.196
There's another Fed
in this building.

903
00:51:09.892 --> 00:51:13.418
We have to find him
and we have to kill him.

904
00:51:13.505 --> 00:51:14.854
All right?

905
00:51:15.463 --> 00:51:17.509
You. go help Danny.

906
00:51:17.596 --> 00:51:18.597
Hurry.

907
00:51:18.684 --> 00:51:20.294
Shut the fucking alarm off.

908
00:51:20.381 --> 00:51:21.426
You heard him.

909
00:51:23.428 --> 00:51:25.169
What the fuck?

910
00:51:25.256 --> 00:51:26.953
What the fuck are you gonna do?

911
00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.433
We don't have a choice.
let's go.

912
00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.609
Jesus! Fuck!

913
00:51:51.064 --> 00:51:52.370
Ah!

914
00:52:02.771 --> 00:52:04.817
Funny place
for a lad to be hiding.

915
00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.168
Who's this?

916
00:52:12.259 --> 00:52:14.479
Time to say hello
to Uncle Paddy.

917
00:52:47.338 --> 00:52:48.382
Shit.

918
00:52:48.469 --> 00:52:50.776
Oh. dammit. Dammit.

919
00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:56.303
Fuck.

920
00:52:57.826 --> 00:52:59.306
Hey. Paddy.

921
00:52:59.393 --> 00:53:00.699
Look what I found!

922
00:53:00.786 --> 00:53:02.396
Oh. the footballer.

923
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:05.312
Your mother
was looking for you.

924
00:53:05.399 --> 00:53:06.879
Did she find you?

925
00:53:08.141 --> 00:53:09.838
Let him go.
Danny.

926
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.146
Did you find her. son?

927
00:53:13.233 --> 00:53:14.452
No. sir.

928
00:53:14.974 --> 00:53:16.541
I also found these. Paddy.

929
00:53:16.628 --> 00:53:19.108
You might want to take
a look for yourself.

930
00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:20.893
Oh. you done good. Danny.

931
00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:22.503
You done good. huh?

932
00:53:23.374 --> 00:53:25.463
This is a fine picture.
Look at this picture.

933
00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:27.378
Is that the family picture. huh?

934
00:53:27.465 --> 00:53:28.901
Yes. Sir.

935
00:53:28.988 --> 00:53:30.207
That's your family picture.

936
00:53:30.294 --> 00:53:32.557
And your father...

937
00:53:32.644 --> 00:53:34.776
your dad's in the military. huh?

938
00:53:34.863 --> 00:53:36.213
He was.

939
00:53:37.866 --> 00:53:39.216
He was.

940
00:53:40.391 --> 00:53:41.783
What's he doing now?

941
00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:50.879
Paging Dr. Miller.

942
00:53:50.966 --> 00:53:52.533
Dr. Michelle Miller.

943
00:53:53.273 --> 00:53:55.406
I assume you can hear me.
Dr. Miller.

944
00:53:55.493 --> 00:53:57.843
or should I say Captain Miller?

945
00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:59.105
Captain Miller.

946
00:53:59.932 --> 00:54:01.542
Small world. isn't it?

947
00:54:02.064 --> 00:54:06.547
Seems like not too long ago.
we met in the waiting area.

948
00:54:06.634 --> 00:54:09.202
just two parents
looking for their kids.

949
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:12.945
I understand that you...

950
00:54:14.207 --> 00:54:18.124
you've had a couple
of impressive careers now.

951
00:54:19.821 --> 00:54:21.997
It's a shame
about your husband.

952
00:54:22.084 --> 00:54:24.173
Lieutenant Jeffrey Miller.

953
00:54:25.392 --> 00:54:29.266
Bobby tells me
that he was quite the soldier.

954
00:54:29.353 --> 00:54:30.919
Quite the soldier.

955
00:54:31.006 --> 00:54:35.489
Now. our family isn't one
for idle threats.

956
00:54:36.142 --> 00:54:38.100
but I can assure you.

957
00:54:38.187 --> 00:54:41.582
Captain Miller.
that this can all go away.

958
00:54:41.669 --> 00:54:43.280
Wouldn't you like that. Bobby?

959
00:54:44.019 --> 00:54:45.630
Mom...

960
00:54:45.717 --> 00:54:46.892
all he wants is his son.

961
00:54:46.979 --> 00:54:48.241
Ryan.

962
00:54:48.894 --> 00:54:50.983
Bobby. mom's right here. okay?

963
00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:52.811
Everything's going to be okay.

964
00:54:53.377 --> 00:54:54.987
Your boy
has nothing to worry about.

965
00:54:55.074 --> 00:54:56.858
He's in good hands.

966
00:54:56.945 --> 00:54:59.339
Of course. it's all contingent
on how my boy is doing.

967
00:55:00.775 --> 00:55:03.561
In fact
I'd like to speak to him.

968
00:55:04.649 --> 00:55:05.824
Let me hear his voice.

969
00:55:07.478 --> 00:55:10.394
He's not here.

970
00:55:10.481 --> 00:55:12.134
But you know
where he is. don't ya?

971
00:55:12.221 --> 00:55:13.440
I do.

972
00:55:13.527 --> 00:55:15.050
Good.

973
00:55:15.137 --> 00:55:17.009
Can I assume he's alive?

974
00:55:17.096 --> 00:55:19.968
He's alive. I promise you.
he's alive.

975
00:55:20.055 --> 00:55:21.753
Oh. that's very. very good news.

976
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.407
We have to go to plan B.

977
00:55:23.494 --> 00:55:25.496
Grab the bag.

978
00:55:25.583 --> 00:55:27.280
Danny.

979
00:55:27.367 --> 00:55:31.458
Now. I don't want this
to go on any longer than you.

980
00:55:31.545 --> 00:55:33.765
So. as good parents.

981
00:55:33.852 --> 00:55:37.246
let's both get our children
back home safely.

982
00:55:37.334 --> 00:55:38.378
Wouldn't you like that?

983
00:55:39.336 --> 00:55:40.641
Yes.

984
00:55:42.295 --> 00:55:45.603
You bring me my boy.

985
00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:48.257
and Bobby will be
right back with you.

986
00:55:48.823 --> 00:55:50.303
That's it.

987
00:55:53.611 --> 00:55:54.612
You did good.

988
00:55:54.699 --> 00:55:55.874
Fuck.

989
00:56:02.533 --> 00:56:03.969
Where's Sean?

990
00:56:21.987 --> 00:56:23.815
You don't need
to do this. you know.

991
00:56:24.555 --> 00:56:26.513
Nothin' gonna
happen to you. doctor.

992
00:56:27.471 --> 00:56:29.168
You don't have to worry.

993
00:56:30.212 --> 00:56:34.260
I need someone level-headed
and clear-minded

994
00:56:34.347 --> 00:56:36.262
to be able to relay a message.

995
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:37.611

I hate to interrupt
your heroics.

1023
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:52.599
but your friend
has a message for you...

1024
00:57:53.687 --> 00:57:55.428
in the parking lot.

1025
00:58:01.782 --> 00:58:02.827
Are you hurt?

1026
00:58:02.914 --> 00:58:05.220
No. I'm okay.

1027
00:58:05.307 --> 00:58:07.832
But there are explosives
attached to my body.

1028
00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:09.877
Good God.

1029
00:58:09.964 --> 00:58:11.226
They sent me out
with a message.

1030
00:58:11.313 --> 00:58:12.793
What do they want?

1031
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.621
And blast and fire...

1032
00:58:14.708 --> 00:58:16.057
They're planning
to execute hostages

1033
00:58:16.144 --> 00:58:18.103
every 15 minutes
until you allow them out.

1034
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.452
Now. I've seen
this type before.

1035
00:58:19.539 --> 00:58:20.584
God forgive me.

1036
00:58:20.671 --> 00:58:22.586
You need to act now

1037
00:58:22.673 --> 00:58:23.717
and get these sons of bitches
before they hurt anyone else--

1038
00:58:37.905 --> 00:58:39.472
What was that?

1039
00:58:41.561 --> 00:58:43.868
What the fuck was that?

1040
00:58:43.955 --> 00:58:45.260
That was my brother.

1041
00:58:51.528 --> 00:58:52.833
Jesus.

1042
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.487
You good. Cruz?Yeah. I'm good.

1043
00:58:55.619 --> 00:58:57.534
Enough of this shit.

1044
00:58:57.621 --> 00:58:59.840
The last thing we need
are dozens of dead hostages.

1045
00:59:00.624 --> 00:59:02.887
Alert the SWAT team.
get them into position now.

1046
00:59:02.974 --> 00:59:04.366
Yes. Sir.

1047
00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:07.587
Motherfuckers.

1048
00:59:07.674 --> 00:59:10.024
Here. I'll give that to you.

1049
00:59:14.246 --> 00:59:15.552
In the name of Jesus.

1050
00:59:17.249 --> 00:59:19.338
What the fucking hell
did you do?

1051
00:59:19.425 --> 00:59:20.948
Hey. what the fuck's
going on with you?

1052
00:59:21.035 --> 00:59:22.689
I had a fucking agreement!

1053
00:59:23.255 --> 00:59:24.648
You've jeopardized
every fucking thing--

1054
00:59:24.735 --> 00:59:26.214
She killed Mick.

1055
00:59:27.433 --> 00:59:29.174
What the fuck
did you think. Paddy.

1056
00:59:29.261 --> 00:59:31.263
that she was just
gonna hand Ryan back?

1057
00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:32.917
She's working for the Feds.

1058
00:59:34.875 --> 00:59:36.137
Little Sean.

1059
00:59:36.224 --> 00:59:38.487
Ah. fuck off. Fuck off!

1060
00:59:39.619 --> 00:59:41.926
What happened to you?

1061
00:59:42.013 --> 00:59:43.492
I favored you as a child.

1062
00:59:44.624 --> 00:59:47.975
I favored you
and your little wild ways.

1063
00:59:48.062 --> 00:59:49.673
I saw myself in you.

1064
00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.240
The only fucking person
you ever thought about

1065
00:59:52.327 --> 00:59:54.286
was Paddy "Big Boy" Quinn.

1066
00:59:54.373 --> 00:59:57.724
I was working for the family
the only way I know how.

1067
00:59:57.811 --> 01:00:00.466
I was fighting
every fucking day with my hands

1068
01:00:00.553 --> 01:00:03.469
to provide you
with a better life.

1069
01:00:03.556 --> 01:00:06.559
Come here.
my life was fucking grand
back in Limerick. thanks.

1070
01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:09.040
You were headed for trouble.
and I saw it.

1071
01:00:09.127 --> 01:00:11.608
I had to pull you away
from those terrorist boys.

1072
01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:13.218
Sean.

1073
01:00:13.305 --> 01:00:16.047
you coulda started over
when we come here.

1074
01:00:16.134 --> 01:00:17.526
What. like Ryan?

1075
01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:18.571
Like Ryan.

1076
01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:20.704
Yes. like Ryan.

1077
01:00:20.791 --> 01:00:23.271
Well. I'm sorry. Paddy.
I don't have the fucking--

1078
01:00:23.358 --> 01:00:25.186
Come here.

1079
01:00:25.273 --> 01:00:27.493
I don't have the brains
to become a lawyer like Ryan.

1080
01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.842
I'm sorry.

1081
01:00:28.929 --> 01:00:30.452
But let me tell you something.

1082
01:00:30.539 --> 01:00:31.976
your son. Ryan.

1083
01:00:32.063 --> 01:00:33.760
was going to see
our family business

1084
01:00:33.847 --> 01:00:35.327
go down the fucking toilet.

1085
01:00:35.414 --> 01:00:36.981
And here's something else
for nothing.

1086
01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:38.635
He was working for the Feds.

1087
01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:46.077
I don't believe that.

1088
01:00:46.164 --> 01:00:47.382
Oh. don't ya?

1089
01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:50.995
Ryan's the reason
we're here. Paddy.

1090
01:00:52.605 --> 01:00:54.085
No. son.

1091
01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:57.654
You're the reason
we're here.

1092
01:01:13.495 --> 01:01:15.454
Jesus fucking wept.

1093
01:01:31.426 --> 01:01:32.863
Fuck!

1094
01:01:34.386 --> 01:01:35.735
Fuck!

1095
01:01:57.931 --> 01:02:00.281
Dr. Miller.
did you get my message?

1096
01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:03.371
He was a good man.

1097
01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:05.504
Yeah. I know he was.

1098
01:02:05.591 --> 01:02:07.375
That's why I chose him.

1099
01:02:07.462 --> 01:02:09.029
But so was Mick.

1100
01:02:09.116 --> 01:02:11.510
I just wanted
to protect my son!

1101
01:02:11.597 --> 01:02:13.773
I'm trying
to protect my brother.

1102
01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.340
And I want him back...

1103
01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:18.343
...and then you can have
your son back.

1104
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:19.561
There's a morgue.

1105
01:02:19.648 --> 01:02:21.433
Lower basement.

1106
01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.131
You come alone. with Bobby.
and I'll be there with Ryan.

1107
01:02:25.263 --> 01:02:27.134
Dr. Miller...

1108
01:02:27.221 --> 01:02:29.484
I was born at night...

1109
01:02:29.571 --> 01:02:32.705
but it wasn't
fucking last night.

1110
01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:34.315
There's another Fed
in this building.

1111
01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.145
He came in the car
with my brother.

1112
01:02:38.232 --> 01:02:41.061
Did you really think
I was just going to trust you?

1113
01:02:42.062 --> 01:02:45.979
I swear on my life.
I will be alone. Deal?

1114
01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:49.113
On your life. huh?

1115
01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:53.291
Can't ask fairer than that.

1116
01:02:55.597 --> 01:02:57.425
That's the morgue.

1117
01:02:57.512 --> 01:02:58.644
That's the best way out.

1118
01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:00.602
What about the hostages?

1119
01:03:00.689 --> 01:03:02.561
Bring them down here.

1120
01:03:02.648 --> 01:03:04.215
Lock them in.

1121
01:03:04.302 --> 01:03:05.912
Americans love a spectacle.

1122
01:03:07.087 --> 01:03:08.349
Let's give it to them.

1123
01:03:08.436 --> 01:03:09.786
He's a liability.

1124
01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:11.613
That's what he fucking is.

1125
01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.267
Nothing new. Paddy.

1126
01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:16.270
He's out of control.
It's my fault.

1127
01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:19.447
My old man used to beat me
something brutal.

1128
01:03:19.534 --> 01:03:21.232
and I swore
I'd never do the same.

1129
01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:23.756
but maybe Seany needed it.

1130
01:03:24.713 --> 01:03:26.367
You did all you could.

1131
01:03:26.454 --> 01:03:29.631
Not every child responds well
to the stern hand.

1132
01:03:29.718 --> 01:03:33.157
And the apple
don't fall far from the tree.

1133
01:03:33.244 --> 01:03:35.202
That's another piece of wisdom.

1134
01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:37.204
Get these people up here. John.

1135
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:38.771
Up. up. up. up. up!

1136
01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:41.295
Move. fuckers. move.
the lot of ya's!

1137
01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:43.123
The lot of ya's. go!

1138
01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:45.386
No funny business.
cocksucker!

1139
01:03:45.473 --> 01:03:47.519
Move. ya cunt. move!

1140
01:03:50.087 --> 01:03:51.871
The Feds are about
to make their move.

1141
01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:53.481
We're making ours first.

1142
01:03:53.568 --> 01:03:54.874
Time's up. Paddy.

1143
01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:56.354
Let's go.

1144
01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.227
People. come on!
Everybody in here!

1145
01:04:00.314 --> 01:04:02.012
Everybody. come on!
Come on. come one!

1146
01:04:02.099 --> 01:04:03.622
Move! Move! Move!

1147
01:04:03.709 --> 01:04:05.450
No funny business
or you're fuckin' dead!

1148
01:04:05.537 --> 01:04:07.408
Where the fuck are you going?
Go in there!

1149
01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:09.106
Get down
with the rest of them!

1150
01:04:09.193 --> 01:04:11.021
You're not a fucking guest.
you're a hostage!

1151
01:04:11.108 --> 01:04:12.457
Come on.

1152
01:04:12.544 --> 01:04:13.545
File in. thank you.

1153
01:04:13.632 --> 01:04:15.155
Sean.What?

1154
01:04:17.244 --> 01:04:19.290
This is
a bad situation we're in.

1155
01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:20.639
We have to think carefully now.

1156
01:04:20.726 --> 01:04:22.293
We have to be calm.
We have to be clear.

1157
01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:25.905
I am being fucking calm
and I am being clear.

1158
01:04:26.732 --> 01:04:30.344
Why don't you just let
Little Seany deal with this.
all right?

1159
01:04:35.306 --> 01:04:37.351
Right!

1160
01:04:37.438 --> 01:04:39.701
I want you all
to fucking listen
very carefully to me.

1161
01:04:50.147 --> 01:04:51.278
Behind you.

1162
01:04:52.062 --> 01:04:53.541
Stay still.

1163
01:04:53.628 --> 01:04:55.456
Arms up!

1164
01:04:55.543 --> 01:04:56.631
Turn around slowly.

1165
01:04:56.718 --> 01:04:58.503
Fuck! Come here!

1166
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:08.600
This one's so easy.

1167
01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:11.559
Take that!

1168
01:05:11.646 --> 01:05:12.909
Cunt.

1169
01:05:24.094 --> 01:05:26.183
Fall back! Relax!
Fall Back!

1170
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:27.836
You fucking bitch!

1171
01:05:33.059 --> 01:05:34.191
Johnno. go.

1172
01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:02.219
Danny?

1173
01:06:04.743 --> 01:06:06.136
Oi!

1174
01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.442
Wake up!

1175
01:06:42.302 --> 01:06:43.782
Give me the boy!

1176
01:06:44.391 --> 01:06:45.914
Give me the boy.

1177
01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.613
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
What the fuck's going on?

1178
01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.397
She killed Danny.

1179
01:06:50.484 --> 01:06:52.791
This is not on that boy.

1180
01:06:52.878 --> 01:06:54.358
This is on all of us.

1181
01:06:54.967 --> 01:06:57.535
Take it down a notch.
we all wanna get out of here.

1182
01:06:59.624 --> 01:07:01.756
I'm following through
on an agreement

1183
01:07:01.843 --> 01:07:03.802
to get Ryan back

1184
01:07:03.889 --> 01:07:05.499
and to get us all home.

1185
01:07:05.586 --> 01:07:08.372
and that's it.

1186
01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:10.156
I'm going downstairs. Paddy.

1187
01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:13.159
Fine. I'm coming with you.

1188
01:07:13.246 --> 01:07:14.639
Bring the boy.

1189
01:07:17.424 --> 01:07:19.426
Have you lost hold
of yourself?

1190
01:07:19.513 --> 01:07:21.602
You're lucky Liam didn't
shoot you in the fucking head.

1191
01:07:22.299 --> 01:07:24.431
Her time will come.

1192
01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:25.606
Come on.

1193
01:07:25.693 --> 01:07:28.044
we're gonna go
see your mom. see.

1194
01:07:28.522 --> 01:07:29.958
You stay close to me.

1195
01:07:30.481 --> 01:07:32.178
Come on. Paddy.

1196
01:07:39.446 --> 01:07:41.144
Jesus Christ.

1197
01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:44.321
what the hell
are they all waiting for?

1198
01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:45.974
The longer we wait.

1199
01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:48.194
the more Sean will take matters
into his own hands.

1200
01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.332
You stay right here.

1201
01:07:59.553 --> 01:08:01.860
Jesus.

1202
01:08:01.947 --> 01:08:04.950
You guys made it.Yeah.

1203
01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:06.821
How are you feeling?

1204
01:08:06.908 --> 01:08:08.475
Not so good.

1205
01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:10.042
Hang in there
just a little longer.

1206
01:08:11.043 --> 01:08:12.610
I spoke to your brother.

1207
01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:14.264
We're gonna do an exchange
and get you home.

1208
01:08:14.351 --> 01:08:16.266
What?Wait. wait. wait.
An exchange for what?

1209
01:08:16.353 --> 01:08:17.397
He'll fucking kill me.

1210
01:08:17.484 --> 01:08:18.790
For my son.

1211
01:08:19.225 --> 01:08:21.923
I'm coming with you.No. you're not.

1212
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:23.360
He thinks I'm working
with the Feds.

1213
01:08:23.447 --> 01:08:24.709
I told him I'd come alone.

1214
01:08:25.536 --> 01:08:27.277
Fuck!

1215
01:08:27.364 --> 01:08:28.539
This is dangerous.

1216
01:08:28.626 --> 01:08:29.714
I'll be fine.

1217
01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:30.932
He's right.

1218
01:08:31.019 --> 01:08:32.543
No matter what he told you.

1219
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:34.980
my brother always got
another motive. it's me--

1220
01:08:35.067 --> 01:08:37.591
I'll protect you. I promise.

1221
01:08:40.768 --> 01:08:42.292
Let's go.

1222
01:08:54.652 --> 01:08:56.567
Sign says
the morgue's down here.

1223
01:08:58.482 --> 01:09:02.529
Doc. I'm pretty
fucking bleeding.

1224
01:09:02.616 --> 01:09:05.880
Just stay with me.
I'll take a look.

1225
01:09:05.967 --> 01:09:07.752
Come on. keep up.

1226
01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:14.802
Hang in there.

1227
01:09:16.108 --> 01:09:17.892
You're almost home.

1228
01:09:20.765 --> 01:09:23.985
Well. would you look at
the fuckin' state of you. chum.

1229
01:09:30.296 --> 01:09:32.168
Nice to put a face
to the voice.

1230
01:09:33.691 --> 01:09:34.996
Florence Nightingale.

1231
01:09:35.562 --> 01:09:37.434
Take it easy.Where's Bobby?

1232
01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:39.697
He's right here.

1233
01:09:39.784 --> 01:09:41.351
Bobby!Mom...

1234
01:09:42.787 --> 01:09:44.180
You okay. buddy?

1235
01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:45.355
I'm okay.

1236
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.661
I'm relieved to see you. son.

1237
01:09:47.748 --> 01:09:49.533
Hey. Da.

1238
01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.666
Now I'm going to give you back
your little boy.

1239
01:09:52.753 --> 01:09:55.321
and you're going to give
us back our little boy.

1240
01:09:55.408 --> 01:09:57.497
And we're gonna come out of here
the way we came in.

1241
01:09:58.411 --> 01:10:00.196
Just like that?

1242
01:10:00.283 --> 01:10:02.372
Just like that.

1243
01:10:02.459 --> 01:10:05.810
Suffering Jesus.
can we please
put the weapons away

1244
01:10:05.897 --> 01:10:07.507
and get this over with?

1245
01:10:15.863 --> 01:10:17.474
Go to your mommy.Come on.

1246
01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.005
We thought we lost you. son.

1247
01:10:27.092 --> 01:10:29.486
We thought we lost you.

1248
01:10:29.573 --> 01:10:32.619
Now. let's--
let's get you out of here.

1249
01:10:32.706 --> 01:10:33.925
Why'd you do it?

1250
01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:37.407
What?

1251
01:10:37.494 --> 01:10:39.365
I wanted to run
the business with you.

1252
01:10:39.452 --> 01:10:40.714
You're my brother...

1253
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:42.499
I fucking loved you.

1254
01:10:42.586 --> 01:10:43.978
What's he talking about?

1255
01:10:44.065 --> 01:10:45.458
He's off his fucking game
on drugs--

1256
01:10:45.545 --> 01:10:48.548
I saw you. you shot
right through my window.

1257
01:10:50.637 --> 01:10:52.117
What?

1258
01:10:53.161 --> 01:10:55.120
That's fucking bollocks!

1259
01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:58.166
All I did was look up to you...

1260
01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:02.475
What?

1261
01:11:02.562 --> 01:11:04.956
You're going
to fucking believe him over me?

1262
01:11:05.957 --> 01:11:08.133
Why don't you
convince me otherwise?

1263
01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.787
Fuck off.

1264
01:11:11.789 --> 01:11:13.486
You tried to kill him.

1265
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.836
I'll never forgive you.

1266
01:11:20.711 --> 01:11:22.016
Come again?

1267
01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:26.020
You'll never forgive me?

1268
01:11:26.107 --> 01:11:29.894
Who the fuck would you
be forgiving. Paddy Quinn?

1269
01:11:29.981 --> 01:11:31.765
You have no right
to forgive anyone.

1270
01:11:32.679 --> 01:11:36.030
You should be asking forgiveness
off of him. me.

1271
01:11:36.117 --> 01:11:37.815
every other person
you fucked over!

1272
01:11:37.902 --> 01:11:40.992
I watched my mother
drink herself to death
for 10 years

1273
01:11:41.079 --> 01:11:43.168
because she couldn't go home
because of you!

1274
01:11:46.563 --> 01:11:48.347
Shut your fucking mouth.

1275
01:11:48.434 --> 01:11:49.957
Oh. yeah?Yeah.

1276
01:11:52.569 --> 01:11:54.179
Sean. stop it!

1277
01:11:57.487 --> 01:11:59.140
Stop! No!

1278
01:12:01.795 --> 01:12:03.580
Move. move. move. move!

1279
01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:05.582
Ready?

1280
01:12:12.502 --> 01:12:14.547
The snipers are in position
and our men are in place.

1281
01:12:14.634 --> 01:12:17.245
Alright. Send them in.

1282
01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.377
Move in. now!

1283
01:12:24.035 --> 01:12:25.819
I need you
to listen to me closely.

1284
01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:29.519
You know those tunnels. right?Mm-hmm.

1285
01:12:38.702 --> 01:12:40.791
When I tell you so.
I need you to run.

1286
01:12:40.878 --> 01:12:42.488
Freeze!

1287
01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:55.458
What the fuck happened to you?
What happened to you?

1288
01:12:55.545 --> 01:12:56.894
What the fuck do you mean
happened to me?

1289
01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:14.564
Dad?

1290
01:13:16.479 --> 01:13:17.610
I deserve it.

1291
01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.832
I wasn't the father you needed.

1292
01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.096
I failed you.

1293
01:13:32.277 --> 01:13:34.148
Go! Now! Now! Go!

1294
01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:42.330
Hey! Hey!
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey!

1295
01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.071
Not so fast. little man.

1296
01:13:44.158 --> 01:13:45.595
Drop it. you piece of shit!

1297
01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:47.118
Let the kid go.

1298
01:14:09.227 --> 01:14:11.098
You fucking bitch.

1299
01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:15.146
What in the name of God.
possessed you

1300
01:14:15.233 --> 01:14:18.845
to stick your fucking nosy tits
into my father's business?

1301
01:14:18.932 --> 01:14:21.108
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon down!

1302
01:14:57.231 --> 01:14:59.146
You can fix this.

1303
01:14:59.233 --> 01:15:01.148
I can fix this.

1304
01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:03.020
You can fix this.

1305
01:15:03.107 --> 01:15:04.456
I can fix this.

1306
01:15:04.543 --> 01:15:05.675
Michelle...

1307
01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:08.504
Wake up!

1308
01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:33.180
What did he used to say?

1309
01:15:33.267 --> 01:15:35.531
Blue to ignite.
Red to make it right.

1310
01:15:40.666 --> 01:15:43.713
Wait-- or was it red to ignite.
blue to make it right?

1311
01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:46.629
Shit! I don't remember.

1312
01:15:46.716 --> 01:15:49.370
You can fix this. Michelle.

1313
01:15:49.457 --> 01:15:52.330
Red. Red's hot.
like a fire.

1314
01:15:52.417 --> 01:15:54.071
Blue...

1315
01:16:38.376 --> 01:16:40.030
Well. I'll be damned.

1316
01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:41.074
My God. you're shot.

1317
01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:42.293
Yeah.

1318
01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.295
Easy first assignment. huh?

1319
01:16:45.862 --> 01:16:47.254
Where's McBride?

1320
01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:49.126
He...

1321
01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:50.431
Fuck me.

1322
01:16:50.518 --> 01:16:52.433
Yeah.

1323
01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.522
Where's the kid?

1324
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.785
What kid?

1325
01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:31.385
Hey. not tall boy.

1326
01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.649
Get up.

1327
01:17:34.606 --> 01:17:35.694
I said. get fucking up.

1328
01:17:41.047 --> 01:17:42.179
Are you deaf?

1329
01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.398
Good.

1330
01:17:55.932 --> 01:17:58.586
If you run. I'll shoot ya.

1331
01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.024
If you scream. I'll shoot ya.

1332
01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:03.113
In point of fact. if you do
anything I don't like.

1333
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.375
what'll I do?

1334
01:18:04.462 --> 01:18:06.159
You'll shoot me.

1335
01:18:06.246 --> 01:18:07.683
You're very clever.

1336
01:18:09.467 --> 01:18:10.990
You're such a clever boy. huh?

1337
01:18:11.077 --> 01:18:14.080
Brains to burn.
very bright boy. huh?

1338
01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:16.430
Tell me...

1339
01:18:16.517 --> 01:18:18.345
is this the way out?

1340
01:18:18.432 --> 01:18:21.914
There's a gate at the end.
I-- I used to play down there.

1341
01:18:22.001 --> 01:18:23.916
Good. Take me to it.

1342
01:18:29.574 --> 01:18:32.185
Leave him alone. Sean!
Drop your weapon!

1343
01:18:33.317 --> 01:18:35.058
Jesus fucking Christ.

1344
01:18:35.972 --> 01:18:38.409
Tiger mommies
and their fucking cubs. what?

1345
01:18:38.496 --> 01:18:40.193
Just let him go.

1346
01:18:41.281 --> 01:18:42.674
It's over.

1347
01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:45.808
No. I won't just let him go.

1348
01:18:45.895 --> 01:18:47.635
And it's not all over.

1349
01:18:49.681 --> 01:18:51.161
I see you stopped my bomb.

1350
01:18:52.553 --> 01:18:53.816
One of us. Dr. Miller.

1351
01:18:55.469 --> 01:18:56.949
Do you think you'll be able
to stop a bullet

1352
01:18:57.036 --> 01:18:59.038
going into the back
of his fucking head?

1353
01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:00.561
Okay.

1354
01:19:00.648 --> 01:19:02.433
Put the gun down. then.Okay.

1355
01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.826
That's it.

1356
01:19:06.089 --> 01:19:07.264
Okay. Easy.

1357
01:19:07.351 --> 01:19:08.352
That's it.

1358
01:19:08.439 --> 01:19:09.614
Easy.

1359
01:19:11.659 --> 01:19:14.053
Bobby. it's gonna be okay.

1360
01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:17.056
We're gonna go home
and practice your soccer kicks.

1361
01:19:18.231 --> 01:19:21.060
Your mommy is a lot fucking
smarter than she looks. boy.

1362
01:19:42.429 --> 01:19:43.691
Mom?

1363
01:19:52.178 --> 01:19:53.701
Okay...

1364
01:20:03.755 --> 01:20:05.801
An incredible scene
here tonight

1365
01:20:05.888 --> 01:20:07.846
at The Mercy Regional Hospital.

1366
01:20:07.933 --> 01:20:09.892
Suspected loyalists
to the Quinn Gang.

1367
01:20:09.979 --> 01:20:13.591
including the patriarch himself.
Patrick "Paddy" Quinn.

1368
01:20:13.678 --> 01:20:16.159
have finally
been brought to justice.

1369
01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:24.820
Hey.Hey.

1370
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:28.649
So Ryan made it. huh?

1371
01:20:31.565 --> 01:20:33.350
Yeah. luck of the Irish.

1372
01:20:35.613 --> 01:20:38.485
Guess Paddy might make it. too.

1373
01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:44.361
Some of the guys
brought this from inside.

1374
01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:47.103
I thought you'd want it back.

1375
01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:52.151
Thank you.

1376
01:20:52.238 --> 01:20:54.501
Dr. Miller.
can you confirm the reports

1377
01:20:54.588 --> 01:20:56.068
that you helped apprehend
the terrorists

1378
01:20:56.155 --> 01:20:57.722
and saved the hostages?

1379
01:20:58.592 --> 01:21:02.379
I did what any mom would do
to save her son.

1380
01:21:02.988 --> 01:21:06.383
Now I can tell you one thing.
she's an American hero.

1381
01:21:07.645 --> 01:21:10.778
None of us would be alive today
if it wasn't for her courage.

1382
01:21:14.739 --> 01:21:16.567
You know...

1383
01:21:17.046 --> 01:21:18.961
you make
a pretty good partner.

1384
01:21:21.093 --> 01:21:23.052
You're not so bad yourself...

1385
01:21:23.139 --> 01:21:24.618
for a rookie.

1386
01:21:27.273 --> 01:21:28.709
I had that one coming.

1387
01:21:32.409 --> 01:21:33.671
I'll...

1388
01:21:33.758 --> 01:21:35.020
I'll see you around.

1389
01:21:35.847 --> 01:21:37.414
Yeah.

1390
01:21:37.501 --> 01:21:38.894
See you around.

1391
01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:46.989
Shall we?

1392
01:21:47.076 --> 01:21:49.165
Yeah.Yeah.

1393
01:21:49.513 --> 01:21:52.603
So I think we're gonna have
to make the next soccer game.

1394
01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:54.561
Soccer game?

1395
01:21:54.648 --> 01:21:56.781
Who needs that when you've got
an action hero for a mom?

1396
01:21:56.868 --> 01:21:58.000
Really?Yeah.

1397
01:21:58.087 --> 01:21:59.349
You weren't so bad yourself.

1398
01:21:59.436 --> 01:22:00.741
You had a killer
scissor kick back there.

1399
01:22:00.828 --> 01:22:02.004
that was like--Mom...

1400
01:22:02.091 --> 01:22:03.440
It's a back-heel kick.

1401
01:22:03.527 --> 01:22:05.485
Oh. I'm sorry. pardon me.
