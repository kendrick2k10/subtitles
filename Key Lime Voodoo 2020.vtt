- You guys don't look like
you're from around here.

108
00:08:00.202 --> 00:08:02.236

- I think she's good. I think
she's got enough perfume.

120
00:08:28.738 --> 00:08:30.545

to be independent honey.

121
00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:33.773
You know. that's the kind of
relationship that's a good one.

when I want to go to Aruba.

128
00:08:57.213 --> 00:08:59.206
I think that I wanna
do some soul searching

129
00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:01.855
and I wanna take a little trip.

130
00:09:02.897 --> 00:09:05.442
- [Paul] Soul searching.
is that a yoga thing?

131
00:09:05.508 --> 00:09:07.940
This is some kind of bigger.
better deal thing right?

132
00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.930
The grass is always greener.

133
00:09:09.996 --> 00:09:13.363
Well it isn't. and where
are you going anyway?

134
00:09:13.429 --> 00:09:15.055
- I'm going to this place called Key Lime.

135
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.391
it's a little town in the Keys.

136
00:09:16.457 --> 00:09:17.224
- [Paul] What?

137
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.057

138
00:09:18.123 --> 00:09:18.891
And you're telling me that

139
00:09:18.957 --> 00:09:21.082
you're completely. completely happy?

140
00:09:21.148 --> 00:09:23.784
- You wanna walk away from all this?

141
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.973
- I'm just a little bored

142
00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:27.612
and I'm a little tired of waiting for you.

143
00:09:27.678 --> 00:09:28.931

144
00:09:28.997 --> 00:09:30.097
There's always someone else.

145
00:09:30.163 --> 00:09:31.613

147
00:09:32.763 --> 00:09:33.531
- All right. so you're not going then.

148
00:09:33.597 --> 00:09:34.882
- No. I am going.

149
00:09:34.948 --> 00:09:36.643
Sorry that's what happens
when you don't pay attention

150
00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:38.842
to the person that you're with.

151
00:09:38.908 --> 00:09:39.988
- So this whole dinner is just

152
00:09:40.054 --> 00:09:42.721
like some kind of bullshit ruse?

153
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.261
- You know I was gonna go tomorrow

154
00:09:48.327 --> 00:09:49.727

So you haven't heard from her at all?

409
00:28:28.593 --> 00:28:31.810
That's where she was headed to Key Lime.

410
00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:33.390
You know. she got some idea in her head

about going there and doing
this. and finding herself.

412
00:28:37.158 --> 00:28:37.926
You can look at it like that.

I gotta go and find her.

- [Woman] That looks like right here.

already got into that though.

548

I found Zoe with my friend Peter.

566
00:36:41.743 --> 00:36:43.272

seen at the bar last time.

571
00:36:59.735 --> 00:37:00.502

00:37:00.568 --> 00:37:01.335
- Pete.

573
00:37:01.401 --> 00:37:02.169
- [Peter] What's up?

574
00:37:02.235 --> 00:37:03.306
- Detective Lax is
working with me on a case.

575
00:37:03.372 --> 00:37:04.586
he has a few questions
he'd like to ask you.

576
00:37:04.652 --> 00:37:05.652
- Sure.

577
00:37:07.442 --> 00:37:09.715
- I need to know if
you've seen this person.

578
00:37:09.781 --> 00:37:12.470
She's been missing for 10 days.

579
00:37:12.536 --> 00:37:15.085
- I saw her about a week
ago. we met at the bar.

580
00:37:15.151 --> 00:37:15.918
- The fuck is this place?

581
00:37:15.984 --> 00:37:16.793
- [Peter] So she's missing huh?

582
00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:18.446
- Yes. she's missing. from the top.

583
00:37:18.512 --> 00:37:19.564
- [Peter] I brought her to Audrey's.

584
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.297
we went back to the bar.

585
00:37:23.881 --> 00:37:26.346
We talked about orchids and life.

586
00:37:26.412 --> 00:37:28.273
We made plans to meet with Audrey again.

587
00:37:28.339 --> 00:37:30.393
Never saw her again. typical girl.

588
00:37:30.459 --> 00:37:31.792
She stood me up.

589
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:35.096
Yeah. we had some drinks. pretty hot.

590
00:37:35.162 --> 00:37:36.427
- [Det. Lopez] Peter. please
show a little respect.

591
00:37:36.493 --> 00:37:37.945
She might be in some trouble.

592
00:37:38.011 --> 00:37:39.326
- She didn't say anything
about a boyfriend.

593
00:37:39.392 --> 00:37:41.056
- That's a real person.
Audrey the orchid lady?

594
00:37:41.122 --> 00:37:41.890
- 100 percent.

595
00:37:41.956 --> 00:37:43.196
- [Det Lax] You might be the
last person to see her alive.

596
00:37:43.262 --> 00:37:45.208
You understand that you're
in serious shit here?

597
00:37:45.274 --> 00:37:46.227

You pick me up and tell
me that you got this.

678
00:41:54.663 --> 00:41:57.895
That if anybody can find her. you can.

679

684
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:07.330
I'm shutting down your fucking department.

685
00:42:07.396 --> 00:42:09.510
- Aren't you over reacting just a tad bit?

686
00:42:09.576 --> 00:42:11.350
- Then I go on to find
out there is missing girls

687
00:42:11.416 --> 00:42:12.920
and you're not even
paying attention to that.

688
00:42:12.986 --> 00:42:15.045
You should be 24-7 looking
for these missing girls.

689
00:42:15.111 --> 00:42:16.846
One of those missing girls is mine.

690
00:42:16.912 --> 00:42:18.898

691
00:42:18.964 --> 00:42:21.240

fuck it is you got to do.

692
00:42:21.306 --> 00:42:23.105
- How about this Paul.
why don't you calm down

693
00:42:23.171 --> 00:42:24.440
and I'll come by and
see you in the morning

694
00:42:24.506 --> 00:42:25.888
and see what we can do.

695
00:42:25.954 --> 00:42:27.168
How does that sound?

696
00:42:27.234 --> 00:42:28.001
- Fucking idiot.

697
00:42:28.067 --> 00:42:28.834

- Yeah. long time.

718

719
00:44:29.254 --> 00:44:31.391
and get some of your
world famous key lime pie.

720
00:44:31.457 --> 00:44:32.767
Hoping you could help me out.

721
00:44:32.833 --> 00:44:35.216
- [Audrey] If there's anything I can do.

722
00:44:35.282 --> 00:44:37.964
- You got a lot of boxes
here. going somewhere Audrey?

723
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:40.156
- I'm just downsizing
before I have to cart

724
00:44:40.222 --> 00:44:42.876
all this stuff over to the women's club.

725
00:44:42.942 --> 00:44:44.004
- Is that so?

726
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:45.430
- Well go ahead and have a look around.

727
00:44:45.496 --> 00:44:46.264
- I will.

728
00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:48.594
- Oh. let me know when you
want that key lime pie.

729
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:49.461
(eerie music)

730
00:44:49.527 --> 00:44:51.678
So what brings you to the neighborhood?

731
00:44:51.744 --> 00:44:53.141
- I'm just looking for a friend.

732
00:44:53.207 --> 00:44:53.975
- Oh yeah?

733
00:44:54.041 --> 00:44:55.202
[Audrey]Oh a girl.

734
00:44:55.268 --> 00:44:56.505
- Maybe you've seen her?

735
00:44:56.571 --> 00:44:58.604
(suspenseful music)

736
00:45:00.836 --> 00:45:01.604
- No. I haven't.

737
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:02.837
I can't say I have.

738
00:45:03.812 --> 00:45:04.579
- You sure?

739
00:45:04.645 --> 00:45:05.412
- Yeah.

740
00:45:05.478 --> 00:45:06.246
- Let me show you again.

741
00:45:06.312 --> 00:45:07.946
- No. I mean. I know pretty
much everybody in town.

742
00:45:08.012 --> 00:45:11.151
but you know. we have a lot of
people that come through. so.

743
00:45:11.217 --> 00:45:12.676
- [Lopez] Tell me more about
these orchids you have.

744
00:45:12.742 --> 00:45:14.289
Most orchids only bloom once right?

745
00:45:14.355 --> 00:45:15.555
- No.

746
00:45:15.621 --> 00:45:17.164
- You wanna look one more time?

747
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.998
- [Audrey] You know what?

748
00:45:18.064 --> 00:45:19.724
I think Peter may have brought her around.

749
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:21.497
he brings so many girls around.

750
00:45:21.563 --> 00:45:23.387
I couldn't really tell you for sure.

751
00:45:26.545 --> 00:45:28.287

752
00:45:37.471 --> 00:45:40.166
(wind chime jingles)

753
00:45:40.232 --> 00:45:42.526
- [Paul] What kind of store is this?

754
00:45:42.592 --> 00:45:44.759
Let me ask you a question.

755
00:45:46.517 --> 00:45:48.735
Thought uou maybe have
seen this girl anywhere.

756
00:45:48.801 --> 00:45:52.102
walking around here in the last few days?

757
00:45:52.168 --> 00:45:53.585
- Never seen her.

758
00:45:55.201 --> 00:45:56.201
I'm so sorry.

759
00:45:59.282 --> 00:46:03.115
- Sir. may I ask you.
have you seen this girl?

760
00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.393
Ever heard of anybody called Audrey?

761
00:46:10.459 --> 00:46:13.519
Something to do with orchids.

762
00:46:15.927 --> 00:46:18.427
(eerie music)

763
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.312
- I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

764
00:46:28.378 --> 00:46:30.878
(eerie music)

765
00:46:41.706 --> 00:46:43.772
- I'm sorry. I haven't seen her at all.

766
00:46:43.838 --> 00:46:45.505
(tense music)

767
00:46:48.341 --> 00:46:49.108
- [Det Lax] Good morning.

768
00:46:49.174 --> 00:46:49.942
- Good morning sir.

769
00:46:50.008 --> 00:46:51.646
- That's a missing person.
you've not seen her anywhere?

770
00:46:51.712 --> 00:46:52.479
- [Clerk] I don't know sir.

771
00:46:52.545 --> 00:46:53.312
- She's not been in the store.

772
00:46:53.378 --> 00:46:54.155
not seen her walking around the street?

773
00:46:54.221 --> 00:46:56.887
You ever heard of somebody called Audrey?

774
00:46:56.953 --> 00:46:58.728
- I'm trained to tell
when people are lying.

775
00:46:58.794 --> 00:47:00.294
- Sorry sir.

776
00:47:01.582 --> 00:47:03.323

- Lopez. how you doing?

791
00:48:21.248 --> 00:48:22.521

How are you brother. everything good?

793
00:48:24.005 --> 00:48:27.378
- So I know you told me not
to go by Audrey's house.

794
00:48:27.444 --> 00:48:30.356
but I have to tell you.
I went by there anyway

795
00:48:30.422 --> 00:48:33.514
as I come to the back. I
hear these crazy noises.

796
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.644
- [Audrey] Immortal flower.

797
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:37.259
- Coming from the greenhouse.

798
00:48:37.325 --> 00:48:39.064
So I peek in the window.

799
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:40.345
Audrey's standing there.

800
00:48:40.411 --> 00:48:43.136
and she's over some
sort of female sculpture

801
00:48:47.341 --> 00:48:49.227
Yelling and screaming. voodoo.

802
00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:51.593
(Audrey screaming)

803
00:48:51.659 --> 00:48:53.863
Yelling all kinds of chants.

804
00:48:53.929 --> 00:48:55.542
(Audrey yells)

805
00:48:55.608 --> 00:48:59.751
It was very bizarre. so I got
out of there just in time.

806
00:48:59.817 --> 00:49:01.150
- Good. perfect.

807
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.335
- It gets even better.

808
00:49:06.177 --> 00:49:07.172
I'm over at my buddy's house.

809
00:49:07.238 --> 00:49:09.307
Skip. you know my fisherman buddy?

810
00:49:09.373 --> 00:49:10.141
- Uh huh.

811
00:49:10.207 --> 00:49:12.169
- You know he's been in
the Keys his whole life.

812
00:49:12.235 --> 00:49:15.035
I mention Audrey's name. I
told him what's going on.

813
00:49:15.101 --> 00:49:16.712
and he said. listen. Audrey was born

814
00:49:16.778 --> 00:49:18.427
and raised in that house.

815
00:49:18.493 --> 00:49:22.165
Her grandmother had deep
connections to the spirit world

816
00:49:22.231 --> 00:49:24.826
and practiced Voodoo in that house

817
00:49:24.892 --> 00:49:27.323
where Audrey was born and raised.

818
00:49:27.389 --> 00:49:29.368
Yeah. this is disturbing.

819
00:49:29.434 --> 00:49:30.872
something strange is going on there.

820
00:49:30.938 --> 00:49:32.835
- Right. right.

821
00:49:32.901 --> 00:49:34.553
- That explains why she's a loner.

822
00:49:34.619 --> 00:49:35.387
- [Lopez] Right.

823
00:49:35.453 --> 00:49:36.605
- Yeah. exactly.

824
00:49:36.671 --> 00:49:38.044
Or she's a witch.

825
00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:39.509
- [Lopez] Yeah. well.

826
00:49:39.575 --> 00:49:40.471
- Listen last time I brought

827
00:49:40.537 --> 00:49:42.176
a girl there. she disappeared.

828
00:49:42.242 --> 00:49:43.742
And now this girl?

829
00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:46.598
She used me to bring girls there.

830
00:49:46.664 --> 00:49:48.658
- [Lopez] Listen Peter.

831
00:49:48.724 --> 00:49:50.706
- I bet you she knows where Zoe is.

832
00:49:50.772 --> 00:49:54.993
- As far as Zoe goes. this is
now an active investigation.

833
00:49:55.059 --> 00:49:56.926
So what that means is I can't have you

834
00:49:56.992 --> 00:50:00.440
or anybody for that matter.
running around asking questions.

835
00:50:00.506 --> 00:50:01.736
- She's probably a Gemini.

836
00:50:01.802 --> 00:50:03.140
You know how they are.

837
00:50:03.206 --> 00:50:05.508
They're split personalities.
you can't trust them.

838
00:50:05.574 --> 00:50:06.797
They go from one side to the next.

839
00:50:06.863 --> 00:50:08.194
- The last thing I need right now

840
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:09.028
is for you to get bitten

841
00:50:09.094 --> 00:50:10.948
by one of these poisonous plants.

842
00:50:11.014 --> 00:50:14.452
- I'm going back there Lopez.
I promise you. never again.

843
00:50:14.518 --> 00:50:15.449
- We understand each other?

844
00:50:15.515 --> 00:50:16.646

00:50:16.712 --> 00:50:18.220

What else have you been
doing since I saw you?

860
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:04.866
- [Zoe] Just starting to relax.

861
00:51:04.932 --> 00:51:07.030
I did some yoga at the park the other day.

862
00:51:07.096 --> 00:51:08.863
- Are you liking Key Lime?

863
00:51:08.929 --> 00:51:11.111
- Yeah. I like it here.

864
00:51:11.177 --> 00:51:13.745
- You must have a boyfriend.

865
00:51:13.811 --> 00:51:16.061
So what's the story with Peter?

866
00:51:16.127 --> 00:51:17.523
- I don't know. he seems nice.

867
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:19.609
I met him at the bar.
he wanted to hang out.

868
00:51:19.675 --> 00:51:21.591
We hung out. he introduced me to you.

869
00:51:21.657 --> 00:51:22.733
But I haven't seen him since

870
00:51:22.799 --> 00:51:24.716
