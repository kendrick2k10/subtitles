00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:10.374
[man]
I've been working
alone for a long time.

6
00:01:11.984 --> 00:01:15.249
4.455 days.

7
00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:18.252
12 hours. 19 minutes.

8
00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:19.731
But who's counting?

9
00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:24.693
I never asked
who I'm working for.

10
00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:28.175
Asking will only
get me into trouble.

11
00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:31.874
And I don't want
any trouble these days.

12
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.491
Everybody knows a good hit man
takes no prisoners.

13
00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:44.408
tells no lies and leaves
without a trace. right?

14
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.458
Except I've never been
that good at the whole
leaving without a trace thing.

15
00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:55.202
I usually leave
a pretty big fucking trace.

16
00:01:58.553 --> 00:02:01.512
When I was a kid. I wasn't
very good at a lot of things.

17
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.081
I wasn't good
at football or soccer.

18
00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:09.738
I think everybody has
one thing they're good at.

19
00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:12.436
One superpower.

[light music]

21
00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:20.401
My superpower is that
I'm really good at

22
00:02:20.444 --> 00:02:22.925
letting other people
make my decisions for me.

23
00:02:25.014 --> 00:02:26.537
Because the way I look at life.

24
00:02:27.408 --> 00:02:29.627
if I don't have to
make my own decisions.

25
00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:32.413
then I can't make any mistakes.

26
00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:37.331
And if I can't make
any mistakes. then I win.

27
00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:41.465
And deep down. we all just
want to be winners. right?

[man]
You want to know why I go
by the name. The Badger?

57
00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:18.247
Because my real name is Dean...

58
00:06:19.248 --> 00:06:22.860
and that's like.
the most uncool name ever.

59
00:06:22.904 --> 00:06:24.384
Dean. The hit man.

60
00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:28.866
Plus. badgers are ferocious.

61
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.175
They'll bite the testicles
off a grizzly bear
if they're cornered...

62
00:06:35.177 --> 00:06:36.613
or at least that's what I heard.

63
00:06:41.096 --> 00:06:42.750
But that's not
how I got the name.

64
00:06:45.448 --> 00:06:47.755
My wife gave me that name
before she died.

65
00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:55.502
No. I didn't kill her.

66
00:06:57.286 --> 00:06:59.070
I sure wanted to sometimes...

67
00:07:01.464 --> 00:07:02.944
but cancer got her first.

[woman yelling in distance]

69
00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:28.491

is not as exciting
as I thought it would be.

[siren wailing in distance]

71
00:07:30.362 --> 00:07:32.930
Most of the time
I'm just waiting around.

72
00:07:35.063 --> 00:07:37.848
Sometimes I wait for weeks
and then I only work for.

73

like. 15 minutes. and it's over.

74
00:07:41.025 --> 00:07:43.767
It gives me
way too much time to think.

75
00:07:45.334 --> 00:07:48.859
You wouldn't believe some
of the crazy shit I think about.

76
00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:51.514
Like. who killed the Kennedys?

77
00:07:51.558 --> 00:07:54.256
Can people time travel
in the future?

78
00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:57.259
Are we all living in a hologram?
Are aliens real?

79
00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:02.873
Well. personally.
I think they are.

80
00:08:05.093 --> 00:08:07.269
You'd have to be a moron
to think that a bunch
of monkeys with guns

81
00:08:07.312 --> 00:08:10.098
were the highest forms
of intelligence in the universe.

they called The Badger?

00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:28.812
Yeah. that might be me.

It's kind of a funny name.

they want you to do next?

She's the closest thing
Vasily has to family.

95
00:09:01.758 --> 00:09:05.719

when she was 13. Sick fuck.

She's the girl
in the upper right-hand corner.

100

You can find her online
most nights down at 10:00 p.m.

101
00:09:25.303 --> 00:09:27.349
It's an easy job for The Badger.

She didn't tell me
she was ill or how bad it was.

194
00:20:17.259 --> 00:20:18.869
She didn't want anybody to know.

195
00:20:20.915 --> 00:20:23.222
I found out she was dead
when I got home...

196
00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:25.789
when I was still at the airport.

197
00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.967

I've always wondered
where thoughts come from.

337
00:40:05.664 --> 00:40:08.710
It's like somebody
hits a download button.

338
00:40:08.754 --> 00:40:11.974
and they come flooding in
from a quadrillion miles away.

339
00:40:13.454 --> 00:40:15.456
And then it takes a while
to process them.

340
00:40:16.979 --> 00:40:20.287
If you process them too quickly.
you can make mistakes.

341
00:40:21.897 --> 00:40:24.465
And if you don't
process them quick enough.

342
00:40:24.509 --> 00:40:26.162
sometimes they disappear.

343
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:30.515
But sometimes
they never disappear.

344
00:40:32.386 --> 00:40:35.389
They'll haunt you till your
grave if you don't act on them.

345
00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:51.579
I don't believe in redemption.

346
00:40:54.103 --> 00:40:57.063
I don't think
you're going to erase your past
by forgiving yourself.

347
00:40:59.935 --> 00:41:01.937

revenge and redemption...

350
00:41:08.727 --> 00:41:10.685

I'm in town on a contract
and I leave in ten days.

359
00:41:41.673 --> 00:41:44.327
But before I go.
I just need to know one thing.

360

it feels like to truly be free?

[Dean]
I don't believe in redemption.

585
01:15:18.688 --> 01:15:21.691
I don't think
you're going to erase your past
by forgiving yourself.

586
01:15:24.911 --> 01:15:27.044
But I do believe in revenge.

587
01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:32.136

revenge and redemption....

588
01:15:33.398 --> 01:15:35.094

One superpower.

01:16:24.405 --> 01:16:26.712
My superpower is that
I'm really good at

593
01:16:26.755 --> 01:16:29.236
letting other people
make my decisions for me.

594
01:16:31.543 --> 01:16:33.240
Because the way
I look at life...

595
01:16:34.154 --> 01:16:37.201
if I don't have to
make my own decisions...

596
01:16:37.244 --> 01:16:38.985
then I can't make any mistakes.

597
01:16:40.465 --> 01:16:43.599
And if I can't make
any mistakes. then I win.

598
01:16:44.817 --> 01:16:48.559
And deep down we all
just want to be winners. right?
