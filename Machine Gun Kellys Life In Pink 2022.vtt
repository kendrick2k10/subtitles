unfortunate because I think

what I was looking for. can we try this?"

he was like. you know. "No."

so we didn't use it.

BAZEXX: The content and the sonic
sound of "Mainstream Sellout"

1068
00:57:31.493 --> 00:57:34.997
was a continuation
of "Tickets" for a reason.

1069
00:57:34.997 --> 00:57:38.083
because all of the issues
that "Tickets" left off with.

1070
00:57:38.083 --> 00:57:39.668
there was no resolution.

1071
00:57:39.668 --> 00:57:44.339
It was like you left off
on like. "I'm lost."

1072
00:57:44.339 --> 00:57:46.258
So. I mean. I think for the second record.

1073
00:57:46.258 --> 00:57:49.136
when we went back into the studio.
we knew we had to follow it up.

1074
00:57:49.136 --> 00:57:51.555
I think we knew that we could take
our time a little bit

1075
00:57:51.555 --> 00:57:54.016
because people were gonna be. all eyes
were gonna be on this.

1076
00:57:54.016 --> 00:57:57.227
so I think that there
was a lot of pressure.

1077
00:57:57.227 --> 00:57:59.605
You know. everybody was checking for this
when it came out.

1078
00:57:59.605 --> 00:58:01.440
so we wanted to make sure
when it did come out

1079
00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.150
that it was perfect. that it was good.

1080

There's no fucking way."

like you have so much to prove.

It's DSPs. What do we need to...

1346
01:12:33.604 --> 01:12:36.732
MAN: We need to be
turning in DSPs like today.

1347
01:12:36.732 --> 01:12:38.442
like now. right now.

1348
01:12:40.402 --> 01:12:42.905
I mean. we've been talking
about this forever. Kells.

1349
01:12:42.905 --> 01:12:45.324
Like I need the final masters like now.

1350
01:12:45.324 --> 01:12:46.992
- I'm putting out another album this year.
Steve.

1351
01:12:46.992 --> 01:12:48.785
so I don't know what
we're talking about.

1352
01:12:48.785 --> 01:12:51.413
STEVE: I know. will you listen?
Well. let me finish then.

1353
01:12:51.413 --> 01:12:53.624
Fuck. I'm not saying you can't
come out with another one.

1354
01:12:53.624 --> 01:12:56.418
What I'm saying is.
this is still a marathon of good music.

1355
01:12:56.418 --> 01:12:59.004
You can come out with "Tickets."
still gonna be played on tour.

1356
01:12:59.004 --> 01:13:02.633
that's a fucking album from a year ago.
but it's fucking great music.

1357
01:13:02.633 --> 01:13:05.469
You're continuing to grow
to be the biggest rock star in the world.

1358
01:13:05.469 --> 01:13:07.513
You wanna do that.
then that music has to continue

1359
01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:10.015
to be listened to
10 years from now.

1360
01:13:10.015 --> 01:13:13.060
Not like. "Oh. we're on to new music."

1361
01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:18.232
New people are finding "Hotel Diablo"
because of how much bigger you are.

1362
01:13:18.232 --> 01:13:23.153
I have people that have just heard it for
the first fuckin' time. period.

1363
01:13:23.153 --> 01:13:27.407
So. what I'm trying to finish my statement

1364
01:13:27.407 --> 01:13:29.868
off of what Abs just said.
and I think all of us can win from.

1365
01:13:29.868 --> 01:13:32.955
is actually go shoot more.
because you know what.

1366
01:13:32.955 --> 01:13:34.873
the list that Nick's
putting over to send to us

1367
01:13:34.873 --> 01:13:38.585
is you having to deliver more than ever
because of how big you've gotten.

1368
01:13:38.585 --> 01:13:41.839
There's more work
that goes into that success.

1369
01:13:41.839 --> 01:13:45.008
It also may mean why you can take a year
off down the road or whatever

1370
01:13:45.008 --> 01:13:47.761
because you're flooding
so much great stuff.

1371
01:13:47.761 --> 01:13:51.640
So my thought is. what Abs is saying
and everybody is.

1372
01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.892
Nick. maybe this resolves
some of the stuff

1373
01:13:53.892 --> 01:13:56.645
that John and Gary really need Colson
to lean in.

1374
01:13:56.645 --> 01:14:00.315
fuckin' hate it. but lean in
and go really hard

1375
01:14:00.315 --> 01:14:02.234
with this content. this music.

1376
01:14:02.234 --> 01:14:03.944
maybe even more album covers.

1377
01:14:03.944 --> 01:14:06.780

are kind of like a journal
