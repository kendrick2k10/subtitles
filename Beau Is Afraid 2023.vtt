all of his neighbors

1725
01:46:33.595 --> 01:46:36.090
had been replaced
by younger generations.

1726
01:46:36.592 --> 01:46:38.631
he recognized everything.

1727
01:46:38.933 --> 01:46:42.701
and somehow
he too felt recognized.

1728
01:46:43.704 --> 01:46:46.474
His home had waited for him.

1729
01:46:46.943 --> 01:46:50.038
just as loyally
as he had searched for it.

1730
01:46:50.876 --> 01:46:52.810
Even the sight
of the evening sun.

1731
01:46:52.812 --> 01:46:56.583
casting slashes of amber light
across a familiar chimney.

1732
01:46:56.885 --> 01:47:00.180
sent him reeling
into a flood of memories.

1733
01:47:02.888 --> 01:47:04.415
What did our father do next?

1734
01:47:04.417 --> 01:47:05.922
And where was the village?

1735
01:47:05.924 --> 01:47:07.660
We only saw it as boys
and have no memories!

1736
01:47:07.662 --> 01:47:08.793
Please.

1737
01:47:08.795 --> 01:47:10.223
-tell us how to find it.
-No. wait...

1738
01:47:10.558 --> 01:47:11.829
What did he do next?

1739
01:47:12.598 --> 01:47:16.031
He was delirious with hunger
and only had enough money

1740
01:47:16.033 --> 01:47:19.133
for one bowl of soup.
but before he could spend it.

1741
01:47:19.135 --> 01:47:21.806
he was invited
to a special play.

1742
01:47:22.241 --> 01:47:23.742
It was already in progress.

1743
01:47:23.744 --> 01:47:25.711
but he felt compelled
to go in.

1744
01:47:26.406 --> 01:47:28.307
so he spent his last dollar.

1745
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:31.343
Not long after sitting in.

1746
01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:34.621
he saw that
the details of the plot

1747
01:47:34.623 --> 01:47:36.854
were impossibly similar
to those

1748
01:47:37.318 --> 01:47:38.823
of his own life.

1749
01:47:39.625 --> 01:47:42.486
and there were three young men
on the stage

1750
01:47:42.488 --> 01:47:44.994
who looked
remarkably like himself.

1751
01:47:45.329 --> 01:47:46.732
This is me!

1752
01:47:46.734 --> 01:47:49.900
And he rose up. at once
exhilarated and terrified

1753
01:47:49.902 --> 01:47:52.232
that it might not be true.
and he announced...

1754
01:47:52.773 --> 01:47:54.168
This is my story!

1755
01:47:55.545 --> 01:47:58.810
And the three young men
immediately recognized the man

1756
01:47:58.812 --> 01:48:00.174
as their father.

1757
01:48:00.176 --> 01:48:03.045

-No. It can't be.
