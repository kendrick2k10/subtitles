All the songs that we're

were on the jukebox
in Stonewall at the time.

if that's true.

Marsha P. Johnson
was hanging out at Stonewall.

15
00:00:56.723 --> 00:01:01.061
And the cops come
to arrest the queers.

She threw it against a mirror
and it shattered.

20
00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.322

That history is in our songs.

that a queer body

Singing has
just always been...

51
00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.466
My mom. she sang
around the house. you know.

52
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.135
all the time when we were kids.

53
00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:01.348
So it's just been
a part of... my life.

54
00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.893
And when I was thinking of
a form that would best represent

55
00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.519
our history.

56
00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.730
it just seemed like
popular music was the thing

57
00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:13.651
that would tell
the story the best way.

58
00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:20.533
So we're gonna do a transition
into the next decade right now.

59
00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.994
We've been working
on this show

60
00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.204
for over ten years now.

61
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:30.585
We took it out on tour
as four six-hour shows.

62
00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.837
I knew I wanted
to do the whole show

63
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.757
as a 24-hour performance.

64
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.510
but I only wanted
to do it once.

Today. tonight and tomorrow.

71
00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:24.014
we are making
a 24-decade history

72
00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.057
of popular music.

73
00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.935
(cheering and applause continue)

74
00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.688
Taylor: I didn't know
if I could do it.

75
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.109
I would be singing basically
nonstop for 24 hours.

83
00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:00.884
I was dreading having to start
our show with this decade

84
00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.844
because most of the music
that has survived

85
00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:06.765
is patriotic music from
the American Revolutionary War.

86
00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:09.059
And maybe you can tell
from the way I'm dressed.

87
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.728
I'm not exactly
an unironic patriot.

110
00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:16.584
This is the song I'm supposed
to feel patriotic about?

111
00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.795
A song that makes fun
of effeminate men?

112
00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.506
But then I did a little research

113
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:26.678
and it turns out that
this song was a British song.

114
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.514
The British wrote it
to make fun of Americans

115
00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:31.141
'cause they said
we were effeminate.

116
00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:34.185
which is really saying something
coming from the British.

117
00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.979
(laughter)

118
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.897
Not only were we effeminate.

119
00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.275
they said we had
no fashion sense...

120
00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.360
(gasps)

121
00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:44.112
...which is kind of true.

122
00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:48.700
But then what happened was
the Americans won a battle

123
00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:52.579
and we pointed our bayonets
at them and we made them dance

124
00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:56.374
and sing "Yankee Doodle Dandy"
over and over and over again.

125
00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:59.210
And that's how it became
an American song.

126
00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.296
Dandy revenge!

127
00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.214
(laughter and applause)

128
00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:06.176

Taylor: Please welcome
the Dandy Minions.
all through the house.

130
00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:13.892
They're here to perform
random acts of fabulousness.

131
00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:16.227
(music continues)

132
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:19.564
Niegel Smith:
Taylor was like. "Look.
I'm looking for a co-director.

133
00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.734
"I'm working on a 24-hour
performance art concert.

134
00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:25.278
which is a radical fairy
realness ritual." (chuckles)

135
00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.572
It is a radical

136
00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:32.534
fairy realness ritual sacrifice!

137
00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:36.664
The gathering. the event.
that is the ritual.

138
00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:40.710
The audience is the sacrifice.

139
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.631
We didn't want to be the only
ones dressed up this evening.

140
00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:47.467
so we brought some drag.
and the dandies are going

141
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.969
to pass that drag out
to you all right now.

142
00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:52.222
(excited cheering)

143
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:58.436
Niegel: It's a ritual
that asks us to move closer

144
00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.105
to our queerness.

145
00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:02.107
and to practice empathy.

146
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.609
and most importantly.
I think. practice joy

147
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.111
and exuberance and maximalism.

148
00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:09.572
-Photographer: Hey. ready?

149

-Machine Dazzle: Supermodel!

150
00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.910
Taylor:
A lot of people would say.

151
00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:15.745
"Have you ever thought
about making traditional work?

152
00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:20.125
I don't know. a-a kitchen sink
drama with a couch?"

153
00:08:20.207 --> 00:08:23.128
And I always thought.
well. the Ancient Greeks

154
00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:26.297
wore platform high-heel shoes
when they would perform.

155
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.299
and they had masks on.

156
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:32.386
and sometimes
when I'm in my drag.
I just feel classical.

157
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.724
(disco music continues)

158
00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:39.102
Taylor: The project started
with the idea of making a show

159
00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:43.106
that was a.
a metaphorical representation
of the AIDS epidemic.

160
00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:46.317
specifically about how
communities build themselves

161
00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.445

torn apart.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.712
and slowly it diminishes.

180
00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.214
diminishes. diminishes.

181
00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:52.467
Taylor and Erin:
♪ He's weeping for ♪

182
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.552
♪ His own true love ♪

183
00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:58.556
The concept came
from the AIDS epidemic.

184
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.184
that...

185
00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:06.523
you fall in love
and then somebody's gone.

Machine and I
are going to change!

194
00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:44.102
Bring down the screen.

195
00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:47.105
(horns blowing.
choir vocalizing)

196
00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:54.279
Machine:
When Taylor first came to me

197
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.782
and said we were gonna do
this 24-decade show.

198
00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.284
I got totally inspired.

199
00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:02.120
I was like. "Oh. my God.
I get to make 24. like.

200
00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:05.457
historical. like.
period costumes. but my way."

201
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.459
So this is Crazy Jane.

202
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.793
She lives in a whisky barrel.

203
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.295
She has a toothbrush.

204
00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:11.713
She has her dildo.

205
00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.632
She has everything
that she needs. She's crazy.

206
00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.301
Taylor: I'd never
tell Machine what to do.

207
00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.470
-Machine: You're crazy. girl.
-Crazy. Crazy Jane.

208
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.931
Taylor: I'll say. "This is
what the decade's about.

209
00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:28.313
I'm gonna sing songs that were
popular in pubs in 1796."

210
00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:30.231
That's all I tell him.
and then he's like.

211
00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.567
"Okay. it's in pubs
and they're pub songs."

212
00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:35.320
So then he makes me
a headdress of corks...

213
00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.821
(laughs) ...right?

214
00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:38.990
Um. corks all popping--
he puts them on little things

215
00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.326
so it looks like they're
popping out of my head.

216
00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.952
He's an artist.

217
00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.705
I'm not gonna tell
an artist to change their art.

218
00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:48.165
-We're good. Thank you.
-All right.

219
00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.585
Taylor:
Whatever he gives me. I wear.

220
00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:53.171
(band playing risqué ballad)

221
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.849
Taylor: We were drinkers.
we were such big drinkers.

222
00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:07.060
The pub
was a community center.

223
00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:10.313
There wasn't clean water
so we had to drink.

224
00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:15.110
We're gonna pass out
some beer to the drinkers

225
00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:19.030
and ping-pong balls
to the non-drinkers.

226
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:23.201
The theater can be so uptight.
and there's so many rules.
and don't talk.

227
00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.161
and don't express yourself
from the audience.

228
00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:27.288
and it's--
you're just there to listen

229
00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:30.375
and to a-appropriately clap
and. you know.

230
00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.669
appropriately laugh
at the right places.

231
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:36.715
And it was just saying.
it's okay for you to be
chaotic in this space.

232
00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:39.009
(risqué music continues)

233
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.054
Now. you're gonna
negotiate with your partner

234
00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:45.348
which one of you
during the next verse

235
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.893
is gonna spit
their ping-pong ball
into the other person's mouth.

236
00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.729
(laughter. woman exclaims)

237
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:55.108
And. drinkers.
just sit back and drink.

238
00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.569
(cheering)

239
00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:04.034
American Revolutionary War
just happened.

240
00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:06.911
They've been living
under the system of oppression.

241
00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.955
It's a little bit like
a kid in high school's

242
00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:11.332
living under the thumb
of his parents.

243
00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:12.584

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.754
Goes to college for the first
time and what does he do?

245
00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:18.256
He turns America
into a frat party.

I found that I couldn't
even get an audition.

260

When you cut your teeth
in the clubs

297
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.256
and then you try
to work in the theater

298
00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.385
and stuff. ah.
ah. it's a long road.

299
00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:11.304
I used to only get booked in.
um. in theaters

300
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:16.101
when there was a festival
going on with a.
a caveat in the title.

301
00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:19.145
I was at Yale
performing one time

302
00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:20.897
in a. in a festival there.

303
00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:23.942
They called it
the "No Boundaries Festival."

304
00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.360
(laughter)

305
00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:29.864
Which made me really nervous
because I have boundaries.

306
00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:32.784
(laughter and applause)

307
00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:35.078
One time at The Cock
I saw a woman.

308
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.832
she pulled a chicken leg
out of her vagina.

309
00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:40.583
-She ate it...
-(audience members gasp)

310
00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.919
...and she threw it
into the audience.

311
00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:44.671
(shocked laughter)

312
00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:47.048
Then...

313
00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:49.092
she pulled
another chicken leg...

314
00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:50.552
(shocked laughter)

315
00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.679
...out of her vagina.

316
00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:56.808
She ate it and she threw it
into the audience.

317
00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.518
(groans and laughter)

318
00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:00.645
Then...

319
00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:02.355
(gasps and laughter)

320
00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:05.150
...she pulled the rest
of the chicken...

321
00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.861
-(shocked laughter)
-...I kid you not...

322
00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.405
...out of her vagina.

323
00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:14.576
She ate it and she threw it
into the audience.

324
00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.202
(groans and laughter)

325
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:19.830
And I thought two things
when I saw that performance.

326
00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:22.208
Only two.

327
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:27.464
The first thing I thought
was. "She's full."

328
00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:28.840
(laughter)

329
00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.259
And the second thing
I thought was.

330
00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:34.012
"She has no boundaries."

331
00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.181
Audience Member:
Whoo!

332
00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:38.183
I actually thought three things.

333
00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:39.517
The third thing was. "Taylor.

334
00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.895
you're just
putting on eyeliner."

335
00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:44.314
(laughter)

336
00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:49.194
Maybe you've noticed this isn't
like a regular concert.

337
00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:52.197
I call this
a performance art concert.

338
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.531
What does that mean?

339
00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.492
At a regular concert.
if you don't laugh

340
00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:58.703
and enjoy every single moment.
cry all in the right places.

341
00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.121
then the artist has failed you.

342
00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:02.207
But in a performance art
concert.

343
00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:05.543
you can-- you can love it
or you can hate it.

344
00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:07.087
You can be bored
out of your mind.

345
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.296
You can despise me.

346
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.881
You can hate everything
I'm asking you to do.

347
00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:14.052
You can be annoyed.
and I still will have succeeded.

348
00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:17.305
(cheering)

349
00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:20.225
It is the genius
of performance art.

350
00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.477
there is no failure.

351
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.145
(cheering)

352
00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:30.568
Gold... The gold goes away...

353
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.444
just a little bit.

354
00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:33.697
Machine:
This is a beautiful opulence.

355
00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:36.908
just for the sake of opulence.
for the sake of beauty.

356
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:40.078
for the sake of...

357
00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.663
effeminism.

358
00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:45.917
-And it's a reveal too.
-It's a reveal. like when--

359
00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:48.920
Because the audience has been
blindfolded for an hour.

360
00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:52.257
so we want them
to concentrate on their
other senses for a while.

361
00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:54.342
There's multiple reasons.
but one is because

362
00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:57.012
they've been staring
at the stage for four hours.

363
00:18:57.095 --> 00:19:00.765
And I thought. let's let them
focus on different senses.

364
00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:04.436
And I wanted this because
the audience is blind.

365
00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:07.981
I wanted this to be the most
beautiful. most opulent costume

366
00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.108
that they don't get to see
during the show.

367
00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:11.985
Yeah. (laughs)

368
00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.945
That's what I love about it.

369
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:16.239
(piano playing
"Coal Black Rose")

370
00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:23.496
My job is to surprise
the audience enough

371
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.915
that it can push them
out of their patterns

372
00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:29.044
and. um. out of the current
mood that they're in

373
00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:31.379
so that they're--
they continue to dig in

374
00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:33.673
and continue to consider.

375
00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:38.678
How can we get everybody to
ask questions in the audience

376
00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.263
about the moment.

377
00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:44.184

I understand that moment"?

Don't applaud that song.

Don't applaud it.
don't applaud it.

413
00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:20.405
That is a sea shanty adaptation
of the very first minstrel song.

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:23.158

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:24.743
(sighs)

416
00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.579
What is happening. and may-maybe
you didn't hear the lyric.

417
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.750
uh. there's this lyric i-in
the song called. ah. it goes.

418
00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:34.753
"One more round
then heave her dry.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.546
come on. Jack Tout.
you're not that shy."

420
00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.965
And what is happening is
the men on the boat.

421
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:40.759
they are hoisting up a sail

422
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.053
and they're trying
to build their community

423
00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:44.512
by hoisting up
the sail together.

424
00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:46.848
with the idea that
when they get their job done.

425
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:50.935
they can go into town
and gang rape a slave.

426
00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:53.229
a woman who is enslaved.

427
00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:54.647
(clicks tongue)

428
00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:57.609
(sighs)

429
00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:02.238
People love things that build
communities. you know?

430
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.910
And they never want to
get rid of anything that
builds a community.

431
00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:08.787
But...

432
00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.705
sometimes you have
to acknowledge

433
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:12.582
that the things
that have built the community.

434
00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:16.211
um. the foundation
for them is evil.

435
00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:18.630
And that it's not serving you

436
00:22:18.713 --> 00:22:21.007
and that you have to
tear it down

437
00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:22.634
and start from scratch.

438
00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:27.138
You can take off
your blindfolds now.

439
00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:34.604
And these are the songs
that are part of our DNA

440
00:22:34.646 --> 00:22:36.981
passed down through us all.

441
00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:41.069
We teach children these songs
and they sing them.

442
00:22:41.152 --> 00:22:44.656

In the Indian Removal Act.
we're singing children's songs.

457
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.885
I wanted Taylor's look to have
a playful element to it.

458
00:23:46.968 --> 00:23:50.722
So it's kind of in
the likeness of a.
like a nanny.

459
00:23:50.764 --> 00:23:53.058
a caretaker
of the children.

460
00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:54.601
or it could be the mother.

461
00:23:55.226 --> 00:23:58.521
I wanted whimsy
for the sake of the children.

462
00:23:58.938 --> 00:24:03.360
but I wanted
something disturbing and sad

463
00:24:03.401 --> 00:24:07.197
as a representation
of the extermination

464
00:24:07.238 --> 00:24:09.074
of the Indians.

465
00:24:11.201 --> 00:24:13.745
Taylor: We tell the story
of the Cherokee people

466
00:24:13.787 --> 00:24:15.789
who are
on the Trail of Tears.

467
00:24:15.872 --> 00:24:17.957
Andrew Jackson had
this agenda to get rid

468
00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:20.168
of all the Native Americans.
He wanted genocide.

469
00:24:20.251 --> 00:24:23.755
Let's sing a bunch of children's
songs on the Trail of Tears

470
00:24:23.797 --> 00:24:26.966
in order to distract you
from what's going on.

471
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:32.097
He forced the Cherokee
to go on this trek
from Georgia to Oklahoma.

472
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.765
And thousands died.

as a ballad
and then it gets fast?

528
00:26:53.988 --> 00:26:59.202
And it was always about trying
to find out how we could exhume

529
00:26:59.244 --> 00:27:02.580
the meaning of the song.
the deeper meaning of the song.

The reason
for the potato chip bags is.

565
00:28:55.652 --> 00:28:58.780

This is the state song
of Kentucky.

580
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.993
a minstrel song.

581
00:29:45.076 --> 00:29:49.914
And they didn't know that
until the 1980s.

582
00:29:49.956 --> 00:29:53.668
so they changed
the word "darkies" to "people."

583
00:29:53.752 --> 00:29:57.088
They couldn't get rid
of the song.

584
00:29:57.172 --> 00:30:00.759
The song was written
by Stephen Foster.

585
00:30:00.842 --> 00:30:04.471
He is considered
the father of American song.

586
00:30:04.554 --> 00:30:08.141
And people say. "Oh. you can't
be too hard on Stephen Foster.

587
00:30:08.224 --> 00:30:09.684
he was a product of his time."

588
00:30:09.768 --> 00:30:13.229
but other people were a product
of Stephen Foster's time.

589
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:16.274
You know. Sojourner Truth.
uh. Frederick Douglass.

590
00:30:16.358 --> 00:30:19.235
and one of the great radicals
of all time.

591
00:30:19.277 --> 00:30:23.490
so radical he's still radical
to this very day. Walt Whitman.

592
00:30:23.573 --> 00:30:24.491
(audience cheers)

593
00:30:24.574 --> 00:30:27.535
Walt Whitman said
that his poems were songs.

594
00:30:27.619 --> 00:30:31.706
So I think Walt Whitman should
be the father of American song.

595
00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:32.957
(cheering)

596
00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:37.671
So what I thought we would do
is to have an epic smackdown.

of father of American song?

It's drag as metaphor

702
00:35:20.578 --> 00:35:23.289
as opposed to drag
as impersonation.

It's in the middle of

with tract housing.

01:00:14.572 --> 01:00:18.410

kinda cheap. ugly houses

it was to call us fags.

Now the white people
in the suburbs.

1113
01:00:31.089 --> 01:00:34.217
they can stop people of color
from being in their community

1114
01:00:34.259 --> 01:00:37.762
by making it really hard for
people of color to get loans.

1115
01:00:37.846 --> 01:00:43.143

is stop the white queer

to the Ted Nugent song
in order to learn it.

01:10:44.035 --> 01:10:45.704
(laughter)

1313
01:10:45.745 --> 01:10:48.373
We read the lyrics
and they seemed bad enough.

1314
01:10:48.415 --> 01:10:50.834
I said. "This lyric
is about fag-bashing."

1315
01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:53.753
And. and I thought.
"Well. that's maybe not true."

1316
01:10:53.837 --> 01:10:57.257
And then I-I heard an interview
with Ted Nugent from the '70s

1317
01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:00.010
where he said.
"This song's about fags."

1318
01:11:00.051 --> 01:11:02.429
He doesn't like anyone
who dresses fancy on a stage.

1319
01:11:02.512 --> 01:11:04.848
and he's gonna set them free.

1320
01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.311
Maybe you could see why I would
take offense to that song.

1321
01:11:10.395 --> 01:11:12.188
(laughter)

1322
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:15.942

I said. "We're gonna
appropriate that shit."

(cheering)

1324
01:11:19.404 --> 01:11:22.741
So. so Matt threw down
some of his own music

1325
01:11:22.782 --> 01:11:26.911
and we decided to turn the song
into a gay junior prom song.

1326
01:11:27.996 --> 01:11:29.914
I want you to find somebody

1327

1330
01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.426

1337
01:11:59.694 --> 01:12:01.863
they can sometimes.
you know. um. ch--

1338

01:15:14.431 --> 01:15:17.350
is a radical format

1387
01:15:17.434 --> 01:15:19.102
for creating community.

1388
01:15:19.144 --> 01:15:20.603
and I. I think

1389
01:15:20.645 --> 01:15:23.314
the number-one reason
we have problems in America

1390
01:15:23.356 --> 01:15:24.983
is lack of community.

1391
01:15:25.025 --> 01:15:26.317
That's my opinion.

1392
01:15:26.359 --> 01:15:30.363
Um. I think that's why
all these people are so angry.

1393
01:15:30.447 --> 01:15:32.032
because they want
to belong to something.

1394
01:15:32.115 --> 01:15:38.663
What Taylor does is
opens the queer community
to the world.

1395
01:15:38.705 --> 01:15:40.915
Taylor: We're gonna focus
on songs that were

01:25:21.871 --> 01:25:23.748
That night I go to bed

1562
01:25:23.832 --> 01:25:29.504
and I have a dream of
Maggie Smith riding a Pegasus.

1563
01:25:29.587 --> 01:25:31.881
(laughter)

1564
01:25:31.923 --> 01:25:34.843
And it is my first wet dream.

1565
01:25:34.926 --> 01:25:38.263
(laughter)

1566
01:25:38.346 --> 01:25:41.433
There are also two men
having sex in the dream.

1567
01:25:41.474 --> 01:25:45.186
but I think it was
Maggie Smith that did it.

1568
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:47.939
I woke up from that dream in.
like. mid-orgasm.

1569
01:25:48.023 --> 01:25:49.941
I was like... (gasps)

1570
01:25:50.025 --> 01:25:53.445
And I immediately thought.
"Gay people.
when they have sex.

1571
01:25:53.528 --> 01:25:56.531
"they give each other AIDS.
and I just had sex.
and I'm gay.

1572
01:25:56.614 --> 01:25:59.826
That means I must have
just given myself AIDS."

1573
01:26:01.786 --> 01:26:04.789
(clicks tongue)
Then all that day at school.

1574
01:26:04.873 --> 01:26:08.501
the teachers were
teaching. teaching. teaching.
talking. talking. talking.

1575
01:26:08.585 --> 01:26:10.795
I couldn't listen to a single
thing they were saying

1576
01:26:10.879 --> 01:26:14.632
'cause the entire time.
I thought. "I'm gonna get AIDS."

So we've reached
our AIDS decade. and. uh...

1593
01:26:54.673 --> 01:26:57.342
I thought we should
lose something very special.

1594
01:26:57.384 --> 01:26:59.719
so this is our last time
with Machine.

1595
01:26:59.803 --> 01:27:01.096
our costume designer.

1596
01:27:01.179 --> 01:27:03.348
(audience sighing)

1597
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:08.228
(cheering)

1598
01:27:09.938 --> 01:27:13.274
Taylor: The audience
has a bond to that queen.

1599
01:27:13.358 --> 01:27:15.402
Every time you see
one of those outfits.

1600
01:27:15.485 --> 01:27:17.278
it is just pure delight.

1601
01:27:17.362 --> 01:27:19.489
so when you think
that all of that delight

1602
01:27:19.531 --> 01:27:23.952
and all that artistry
was gonna be taken away.

1603
01:27:24.035 --> 01:27:26.496
for me. it's...

1604
01:27:26.538 --> 01:27:30.959
what it was like to come of age
during the AIDS epidemic.

1605
01:27:31.042 --> 01:27:34.504
Uh. every incredible artist

1606
01:27:34.546 --> 01:27:39.050
that you... hoped
would be a mentor.

1607
01:27:39.092 --> 01:27:41.386
you know. um. passes.

1608
01:27:41.428 --> 01:27:44.597
(cheering and applause)

1609
01:27:44.681 --> 01:27:47.976
Taylor: It's time to say
goodbye to our guitarist.

1610
01:27:48.059 --> 01:27:50.061
Viva DeConcini.

1611
01:27:54.482 --> 01:27:57.235
Niegel: The first time
we lose a musician

1612
01:27:57.277 --> 01:27:59.237
after the first hour.
you're like.

1613
01:27:59.279 --> 01:28:02.782
"But you've
only been here an hour."

1614
01:28:02.866 --> 01:28:05.577
Uh... Hmm. Excuse me.

1615
01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.663
(voice breaking)
Uh. we lost so many people
in our community.

1616
01:28:08.747 --> 01:28:13.043
um. to HIV and AIDS
and the complications.

1617
01:28:13.126 --> 01:28:15.253
and some folks
had only been with us

1618
01:28:15.337 --> 01:28:18.298
for a very short amount
of time.

1619
01:28:19.883 --> 01:28:22.594
(sighs) Excuse me.

1620
01:28:22.677 --> 01:28:25.889
So it's very hard to lose
people throughout the work.

1621
01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:31.895
um. and-and to be reminded
of that. um. in our community.

1622
01:28:31.936 --> 01:28:36.733
Uh. so. yeah.
it's deeply significant...

1623
01:28:36.775 --> 01:28:38.860
because when you're.
when you're left.

1624
01:28:38.943 --> 01:28:41.196
and you've been working
with them so hard

1625
01:28:41.279 --> 01:28:43.615
and then they're gone and
you're left and so you're like.

1626
01:28:43.656 --> 01:28:45.367
"Great. I have to.
I have to keep going.

1627
01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:48.495
I have to keep bringing
my artistry and my voice."

1628
01:28:48.578 --> 01:28:52.457
Uh. I think there's
so much poetry in that...

1629
01:28:54.417 --> 01:28:57.003
but that's also our life.

1630
01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:00.465
(cheering)

1631
01:29:07.472 --> 01:29:10.350
Taylor: Dating in the '90s
was navigating

1632
01:29:10.433 --> 01:29:13.812
whether or not
you wanted to go on a date

1633
01:29:13.895 --> 01:29:16.940
with someone who might not
be here in six months.

1634
01:29:17.023 --> 01:29:22.362
Never having the moment
where your sexuality is free.

1635
01:29:22.445 --> 01:29:24.906
(clicks tongue) Yeah.

1636
01:29:24.948 --> 01:29:27.450
So not... not kinda having

1637
01:29:27.492 --> 01:29:29.494
the sense of
what you may be missing.

1638
01:29:29.577 --> 01:29:32.497
but you know. always.
always being afraid of sex.

(cheering)

1681
01:32:00.812 --> 01:32:06.484
The very first time I ever
met an "out" homosexual.

1682
01:32:06.568 --> 01:32:10.655
it was thousands
all at the same time.

1683
01:32:10.739 --> 01:32:13.241
I found out about this thing
called an AIDS Walk.

1684
01:32:13.324 --> 01:32:17.037
and my friend Marcy and I
went to the AIDS Walk.

1685
01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.080
uh. in San Francisco.

1686
01:32:19.164 --> 01:32:23.585
and the first time
I ever saw one "out" homosexual.
it was thousands of them.

1687
01:32:23.668 --> 01:32:26.713
and the reason they were
all together is 'cause.
of course. they were dying.

1688
01:32:26.796 --> 01:32:29.174
and their loved ones
were dying.

1689
01:32:29.257 --> 01:32:34.637
and they were screaming and
laughing and dancing and joyous.

1690
01:32:34.679 --> 01:32:38.767
while at the same time
horrified and full of sorrow.

1691
01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:42.854
and they. uh. were pushing
loved ones in wheelchairs

1692
01:32:42.896 --> 01:32:44.647
and...

1693
01:32:46.107 --> 01:32:47.859
uh...

1694
01:32:49.027 --> 01:32:51.404
what I experienced
was a community of people

1695
01:32:51.488 --> 01:32:54.532
that were being. um. built

1696
01:32:54.616 --> 01:32:57.243
as a result
of being torn apart.

1697
01:32:57.327 --> 01:33:01.289
and it was a pretty profound
experience for a kid.

1698
01:33:01.373 --> 01:33:04.167
Years later. I thought.
many years later. I thought.

1699
01:33:04.209 --> 01:33:10.256
I wanna make a show that
is some kind of metaphorical
representation of that.

1700
01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:14.636
So we started making
a 24-decade history
of popular music.

1701
01:33:20.725 --> 01:33:23.019
This decade is all songs
that were popular

1702
01:33:23.061 --> 01:33:26.690
with radical lesbians
during the AIDS epidemic.

1703
01:33:26.731 --> 01:33:30.735
Many gay men. their parents.
family members wouldn't
take care of them

1704
01:33:30.819 --> 01:33:34.989
and their lovers were dying
at the same time that
they were struggling.

1705
01:33:35.073 --> 01:33:37.617
and so. um...

1706
01:33:37.701 --> 01:33:41.996
many lesbians
really stepped up

1707
01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:45.750
in a way that was
above and beyond.

1708
01:33:45.792 --> 01:33:49.963
(rock music playing)

1709
01:33:50.046 --> 01:33:53.925
Taylor: I learned my politics
from radical lesbians

1710
01:33:54.009 --> 01:33:57.637
and I learned
how to have confidence
from radical lesbians.

1711
01:33:58.596 --> 01:34:04.769
Lesbians spend
so much time having to stretch
towards the rest of us.

1712
01:34:06.396 --> 01:34:09.107
I thought it would be sweet

1713
01:34:09.149 --> 01:34:12.444
if we invite all of
the lesbians in the audience

1714
01:34:12.527 --> 01:34:13.778
to come up on stage.

1715
01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:16.281
