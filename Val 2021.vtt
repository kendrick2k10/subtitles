3
00:05:55.773 --> 00:05:58.776
It's like I've lived my life

4
00:06:00.027 --> 00:06:01.361
and

5
00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:03.572
it's sort of

6
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.201
all in these boxes

7
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.161
but what

8
00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.622
is part of the

9
00:06:12.164 --> 00:06:14.625
profound sadness

10
00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.752
is that

11
00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:19.338
I know it's incomplete

12
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.508
as much as I've

13
00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:27.387
filmed and as hard as I've tried

14
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:30.432
there's nothing I can do

15
00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:32.935
to make

16
00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:35.479
any of it understood.

17
00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.606
I know that

18
00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.858
that's not true

19
00:06:39.942 --> 00:06:43.654
but it's how I feel.

20
00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:57.300
Hi.

21
00:11:57.384 --> 00:12:01.138
I'm meeting the director
of the drama division

22
00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.807
to show my son the school.

23
00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:16.588
She was so hard on us.

24
00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:26.848
Right under...

25
00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:30.393
Do you know who that is?

26
00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:33.939
That's a famous actress.

27
00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:36.066
Kelly McGillis.

28
00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:41.530
It sure does.

29
00:22:07.744 --> 00:22:09.620
I miss London bad.

30
00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:11.914
It's just. you know

31
00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:14.042
the first big city I came to

32
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.421
after New York.

33
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:46.183
So as you have seen now several times

34
00:28:46.267 --> 00:28:51.147
I can't speak without plugging this hole.

35
00:28:51.564 --> 00:28:53.107
This is because

36
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.817
they put a piece of plastic

37
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.903
down my breathing tube

38
00:28:57.987 --> 00:29:00.865
which is also. as everyone knows

39
00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:03.159
where your food goes down

40
00:29:03.242 --> 00:29:06.954
and because the hole is so small

41
00:29:08.372 --> 00:29:10.541
you have to make a choice

42
00:29:10.624 --> 00:29:12.960
when you have
this kind of problem whether you

43
00:29:13.544 --> 00:29:15.379
breathe or eat.

44
00:29:15.463 --> 00:29:18.340
Obviously. if you can't breathe.
you can't eat.

45
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:38.772
I used to hate the valley
with an absolute passion.

46
00:31:40.774 --> 00:31:42.026
I hate it.

47
00:31:44.445 --> 00:31:45.446
It's so. uh.

48
00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:46.739
it's the rim of hell.

49
00:31:46.822 --> 00:31:49.116
It's where hell begins. right here.

50
00:31:49.575 --> 00:31:51.452
If you look over the edge.

51
00:31:51.535 --> 00:31:53.579
you can look down into hell.

52
00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:02.463
I haven't been out here in fifteen years.

53
00:32:02.546 --> 00:32:06.258
The last time I was out here was making

54
00:32:06.342 --> 00:32:11.388
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
with Robert Downey Jr.

55
00:32:12.056 --> 00:32:14.141
That house was there

56
00:32:14.224 --> 00:32:17.269
but the rest of these houses weren't here

57
00:32:17.353 --> 00:32:20.022
and my Dad bought all the property

58
00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:21.148
and

59
00:32:21.231 --> 00:32:23.651
sold each one of the lots

60
00:32:23.734 --> 00:32:26.236
so he could

61
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.823
decide who his neighbors were gonna be.

62
00:32:30.199 --> 00:32:32.785
This is my old house.

63
00:32:32.868 --> 00:32:35.704
The second house.

64
00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:40.376
It's full of death.

65
00:42:15.408 --> 00:42:19.913
For Joanne. my wife. it was total hell.

66
00:42:21.915 --> 00:42:25.335
Home was just another place to rehearse.

67
00:42:31.341 --> 00:42:34.094
She tried to be supportive but

68
00:42:34.177 --> 00:42:35.428
also just the music

69
00:42:35.512 --> 00:42:37.889
over. and over. and over again.

70
00:42:50.235 --> 00:42:53.571
Jim had this aspiration to

71
00:42:54.656 --> 00:42:57.075
capture this

72
00:42:58.201 --> 00:43:00.203
fleeting

73
00:43:00.287 --> 00:43:02.664
ethereal truth.

74
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:08.003
I think it's Yeats who said.

75
00:43:08.086 --> 00:43:09.796
I'm paraphrasing but

76
00:43:09.879 --> 00:43:11.506
the idea is

77
00:43:13.133 --> 00:43:17.178
you see a tree and you observe a truth

78
00:43:17.262 --> 00:43:19.723
about the tree

79
00:43:25.437 --> 00:43:27.605
and you're hit with it.

80
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:32.319
the magic of the tree.

81
00:46:13.271 --> 00:46:15.857
I see this

82
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.150
hole in my throat

83
00:46:17.233 --> 00:46:18.234
and I wonder

84
00:46:20.153 --> 00:46:22.530
whether people wonder

85
00:46:23.031 --> 00:46:25.450
if I've had any fear of dying.

86
00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:30.955
Because I obviously

87
00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:35.627
am

88
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.754
sounding

89
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.509
much worse than I feel.

90
00:46:42.592 --> 00:46:46.095
But it's an obstacle obviously that

91
00:46:46.638 --> 00:46:48.640
is uh

92
00:46:48.723 --> 00:46:53.186
very present with whoever sees me.

93
00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:55.271
And

94
00:46:57.815 --> 00:47:01.486
I have had fears

95
00:47:01.569 --> 00:47:04.822
but none that have ever

96
00:47:06.199 --> 00:47:09.160
been overwhelming

97
00:47:09.577 --> 00:47:12.539
about my life

98
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:15.124
because I

99
00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:19.379
don't believe in death

100
00:47:19.462 --> 00:47:21.297
and my whole life I've

101
00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:25.802
tried to see the world

102
00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:28.513
as one

103
00:47:29.013 --> 00:47:31.182
piece of life.

104
00:47:31.266 --> 00:47:33.226
That's how I understand it right.

105
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:35.478
when you pull back

106
00:47:35.562 --> 00:47:37.730
from the planet. you see that

107
00:47:37.814 --> 00:47:39.983
we're all one

108
00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.318
life source.

109
00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.801
Hi sweetheart.

110
00:48:08.344 --> 00:48:10.221
You're not quite ready yet.

111
00:48:11.764 --> 00:48:12.640
Ok.

112
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:14.892
I'm going to come...

113
00:48:14.976 --> 00:48:16.603
I'm going to come over to you right?

114
00:48:16.686 --> 00:48:17.770
Pick you up?

115
00:48:17.854 --> 00:48:19.022
Alright.

116
00:52:47.707 --> 00:52:49.125
Sure why not?

117
00:53:18.112 --> 00:53:19.906
Holy cow.

118
00:53:21.407 --> 00:53:22.909
Howdy.

119
00:53:22.992 --> 00:53:24.785
Not bad.

120
00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:31.375
Thank you so much.

121
00:53:32.001 --> 00:53:33.669
Thunderheart.

122
00:53:45.473 --> 00:53:47.183
Thank you.

123
00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:48.351
Fantastic.

124
00:53:49.226 --> 00:53:52.063
Val Kilmer "Chosen by God."

125
00:54:07.662 --> 00:54:09.830
I blew his mind in South India.

126
00:54:19.298 --> 00:54:21.133
I always love it here

127
00:54:21.425 --> 00:54:23.177
in Texas because

128
00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.388
my father was born here.

129
00:54:27.139 --> 00:54:30.267
Even though he passed on

130
00:54:30.351 --> 00:54:33.813
I always feel close by
when I come to Texas

131
00:54:34.355 --> 00:54:35.690
and um

132
00:54:37.441 --> 00:54:38.693
and um

133
00:54:38.776 --> 00:54:41.112
I'm having such a great time here.

134
00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.489
I'd like to thank everybody for

135
00:54:43.572 --> 00:54:45.700
putting on such a great show.

136
00:55:05.803 --> 00:55:07.346
Sometimes

137
00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:12.810
I feel so low and I have the blues

138
00:55:12.893 --> 00:55:15.229
really really hard

139
00:55:15.312 --> 00:55:18.149
about having to

140
00:55:18.232 --> 00:55:21.360
you know. fly around the country.

141
00:55:23.571 --> 00:55:25.823
I don't look great and

142
00:55:25.906 --> 00:55:31.412
I'm selling basically my old self.
my old career.

143
00:55:33.247 --> 00:55:35.082
For many people

144
00:55:35.166 --> 00:55:38.627
it's like the lowest thing you can do is

145
00:55:38.711 --> 00:55:43.674
talk about your old pictures
and sell photographs

146
00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.844
of when you were Batman or

147
00:55:48.012 --> 00:55:50.306
the Terminator...

148
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:54.393
I don't want to insult
any of the other actors

149
00:55:54.477 --> 00:55:56.228
that fly around the world...

150
00:56:07.948 --> 00:56:11.911
But it enables me to

151
00:56:11.994 --> 00:56:14.371
meet my fans and

152
00:56:17.333 --> 00:56:19.376
and what ends up happening is

153
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:25.091
I feel really grateful
rather than humiliated

154
00:56:26.467 --> 00:56:29.220
because there's so many people.

155
00:59:32.611 --> 00:59:34.947
Actors like Tommy Lee Jones

156
00:59:37.241 --> 00:59:40.369
had designed this whole performance

157
00:59:40.452 --> 00:59:42.955
and so had Jim Carrey.

158
00:59:51.213 --> 00:59:53.799
It was just so huge.

159
00:59:53.882 --> 00:59:57.386
I think it made no difference
what I was doing.

160
00:59:58.053 --> 01:00:00.389
I tried to be like an

161
01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:03.392
actor on a soap opera.

162
01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:06.645
The way I would turn to Nicole.

163
01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:18.532
Go count how many times

164
01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.160
I put my hands on my hips.

165
01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:23.787
I don't know how they come up with this

166
01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:26.165
style of acting

167
01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:28.208
but they seem to go

168
01:00:29.168 --> 01:00:31.211
go to soap opera school.

169
01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:34.840
"Why. why. why would you say that?"

170
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:09.828
I wanna take a break.

171
01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:12.789
Yeah. my stomach...

172
01:03:22.758 --> 01:03:24.593
I wanna lay down.

173
01:12:30.722 --> 01:12:33.308
John Frankenheimer:
Ok. Uh. This has just gone too far.

174
01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:34.601
I can't do it.

175
01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:36.561
If we're going to work this way.

176
01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:37.812
Shut the video camera off.

177
01:12:37.896 --> 01:12:39.105
Val: Are we rehearsing?

178
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:41.816
JF: We are about to rehearse. Would you
please shut the video camera off.

179
01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.110
Val: No. Because I'm
in a highly emotional state.

180
01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:47.739
because you said earlier to David and I.
you were going to leave this movie.

181
01:12:47.822 --> 01:12:50.241
JF: If this continues... I will not

182
01:12:50.325 --> 01:12:53.495
I do not see how I could function
under these conditions.

183
01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:55.371
I'm supposed to be doing creative work

184
01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:57.791
and this is not conducive
to creating a good scene.

185
01:12:57.874 --> 01:12:58.708
Val: Well -

186
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.377
can I have a minute.
because I'm in an emotional state

187
01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:03.254
and I won't be able to read my lines.

188
01:13:03.338 --> 01:13:05.048
JF: By all means. please have a minute.

189
01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:07.425
I'll tell you what.
When you guys are ready to rehearse -

190
01:13:07.509 --> 01:13:09.427
Val: I'm ready to rehearse right now.

191
01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:11.221
JF: Shut the video camera off?

192
01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:14.390
Val: I need a witness
because of things you've said.

193
01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:15.558
JF: Things that I've said?

194
01:13:15.642 --> 01:13:16.643
Val: Yeah.

195
01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:20.063
Val: You've debated
in front of your two lead actors.

196
01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:22.398
on whether you will continue
to direct this film.

197
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:25.568
That puts me in a state of mind -

198
01:13:25.652 --> 01:13:27.821
not conducive to creating.

199
01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:30.156
JF: Please shut the video camera off.

200
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.742
Val: I will keep it on
until we're rehearsing.

201
01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:05.441
Gimme a shove.

202
01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:14.659
Big...big...big shove.

203
01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:17.412
Yeah. That's good.

204
01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:19.414
Ah...there we are.

205
01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:07.446
The reason I'm wearing an AZ hat.

206
01:21:08.656 --> 01:21:09.949
is that

207
01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:12.243
I'm going to Arizona

208
01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:14.704
because

209
01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:17.123
my mother passed on.

210
01:21:17.999 --> 01:21:19.750
and

211
01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:21.752
she uh.

212
01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:25.798
right now she doesn't have
anyone to cremate her.

213
01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.725
It glows in the dark.

214
01:22:18.768 --> 01:22:20.645
It's very pretty.

215
01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:28.819
I like those with that dress.

216
01:22:30.446 --> 01:22:32.031
Ok. time to go!

217
01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:31.418
I wrote something nice last night
all about her style.

218
01:25:31.502 --> 01:25:34.505
Her hairdo and her jewelry

219
01:25:35.256 --> 01:25:36.507
they always popped.

220
01:26:44.825 --> 01:26:47.036
I miss my mama.

221
01:26:53.042 --> 01:26:55.294
But I had a vision

222
01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.839
that she was so happy

223
01:26:58.923 --> 01:27:01.967
with her youngest son.

224
01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:58.068
Why are we here?

225
01:40:11.756 --> 01:40:15.093
So we're going out to Malibu

226
01:40:15.176 --> 01:40:18.972
because of my wonderful little church

227
01:40:19.514 --> 01:40:20.348
and

228
01:40:20.432 --> 01:40:23.893
my members there. I love them very much.

229
01:40:25.729 --> 01:40:29.065
I've studied all the major religions.

230
01:40:29.941 --> 01:40:32.986
I've always been interested in religions

231
01:40:33.069 --> 01:40:33.945
and

232
01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:36.030
often when I meet someone

233
01:40:36.114 --> 01:40:38.158
I'll end up talking about their faith.

234
01:40:38.241 --> 01:40:39.659
I'll ask them.

235
01:40:58.261 --> 01:40:59.637
I can't help it

236
01:41:00.597 --> 01:41:01.973
I'm a bastard

237
01:41:03.558 --> 01:41:04.893
and I love you.

238
01:41:10.565 --> 01:41:12.400
It's very. very funny.

239
01:41:15.862 --> 01:41:17.405
Malibu. six miles.

240
01:41:21.367 --> 01:41:23.703
Oh look at the ocean.

241
01:41:25.914 --> 01:41:30.919
What would happen if
I went into this church service

242
01:41:31.002 --> 01:41:35.048
and I came out speaking perfectly well?

243
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:59.030
It's a very good lesson for me to study

244
01:41:59.113 --> 01:42:01.324
about victory over the grave.
