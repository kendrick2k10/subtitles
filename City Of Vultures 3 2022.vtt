it under control.

crook in your neck.

204

It's gonna be okay. I promise.

221
00:21:56.182 --> 00:21:57.390
- Come on.

222
00:21:57.425 --> 00:21:58.556
Shut it up.

223
00:21:58.591 --> 00:22:00.118
- No. please. don't hurt them.

224
00:22:41.832 --> 00:22:45.163
- You had a nice
little run. didn't you?

225
00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:47.572
You know. I should have
smacked you across the head

226
00:22:47.607 --> 00:22:49.167
with this motherfucking pistol.

227
00:22:59.212 --> 00:23:00.618
You didn't think there was
no more vultures out here.

228
00:23:00.653 --> 00:23:01.454
did you?

229
00:23:05.889 --> 00:23:07.055
You know.

230
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.594
this thing had about 500.000
on that table in that crib.

231
00:23:13.567 --> 00:23:14.962
But we ain't find no dope.

232
00:23:19.265 --> 00:23:20.968
And that's some good ass dope.

233
00:23:25.546 --> 00:23:27.546
Where the rest of it at?

234
00:23:39.824 --> 00:23:41.494
You don't want your
wife and your daughter

235
00:23:41.529 --> 00:23:43.463
to hear you in here
screaming and shit.

236
00:23:44.829 --> 00:23:46.466
Where you get that shit from?

237
00:23:54.036 --> 00:23:54.837

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.510
Look. I ain't fucking stupid.

You got me.

00:24:25.639 --> 00:24:27.573
That 490 was my reup money.

251
00:24:30.006 --> 00:24:31.742
Don't give a fuck

I'm gonna meet up
with him as planned.

258
00:24:54.866 --> 00:24:57.229
- All you got to do is
figure out the rest.

259
00:24:58.265 --> 00:24:59.231
You've doubled up.

260
00:25:04.678 --> 00:25:05.578
- Yeah. we doubled up.

261
00:25:07.373 --> 00:25:09.076
But if you want them
bitches in there to live.

262
00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:10.649

We just licked they

Don't be posting

00:33:18.666 --> 00:33:20.468
Don't be sitting in

Where's your mama?

327
00:34:09.189 --> 00:34:10.584
- I don't know. Dad.

328
00:34:10.619 --> 00:34:13.587
She left in somebody

- What took you so long
to answer the door?

386
00:38:26.039 --> 00:38:28.347
- Because you banging on the
door like you the police.

387
00:38:35.917 --> 00:38:36.683
- Can you sit down?

388
00:38:38.018 --> 00:38:39.919
Today. just without
the bad talk.

389
00:38:43.463 --> 00:38:44.792

Can you do that?

393
00:38:48.127 --> 00:38:48.763
- Yeah I can do it.
- Without the damn back talk?

394
00:38:48.798 --> 00:38:50.028
- Damn.

395
00:38:50.063 --> 00:38:51.436
- Hey bro. check it out.

396
00:38:51.471 --> 00:38:53.438
We got some more
cars coming through.

397
00:38:53.473 --> 00:38:54.131
- Come on. bro. come on.

398
00:39:03.175 --> 00:39:04.614
- Here. man.

399
00:39:04.649 --> 00:39:06.110
I had to break the
bank for this one.

400
00:39:06.145 --> 00:39:08.112
- What I tell you about
bringing me loose change?

401
00:39:08.147 --> 00:39:09.014
- Come on. man.

402
00:39:09.049 --> 00:39:09.850
All spend the same. man.

403
00:39:09.885 --> 00:39:10.950
It's just change. man.

404
00:39:20.797 --> 00:39:21.631
- Got a car coming. bro.

405
00:39:21.666 --> 00:39:22.764
- Bet.

406
00:39:22.799 --> 00:39:24.535
Hey. man. let's go back here.

407
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.405
- Cars coming through.

408
00:39:48.891 --> 00:39:50.627
- Hey man. why you got
the motherfucking dope?

409
00:39:50.662 --> 00:39:51.496
Oh.

410
00:39:52.598 --> 00:39:54.862
- No. no. no. please don't.

411
00:39:56.866 --> 00:40:00.472
Please. baby. no.
please.

412
00:40:02.872 --> 00:40:04.509
- When my spot
stop making money.

413
00:40:08.548 --> 00:40:10.845
it's only right I find out
where the action going.

414
00:40:15.687 --> 00:40:16.554
Vulture packs.

415
00:40:18.888 --> 00:40:20.888
I see they even got
they own slogan.

416
00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.562
Vulture packs.

417
00:40:24.597 --> 00:40:27.191
- Please don't.
please don't do this.

418
00:40:27.226 --> 00:40:28.533
- The only way to fly.

419
00:40:31.736 --> 00:40:34.539
I'm gonna make sure both of
y'alls get y'all wings today.

420
00:41:10.643 --> 00:41:12.775
- That nigga ain't
loyal to nobody.

421
00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:13.809
He weak.

422
00:41:15.879 --> 00:41:19.617
Let a young bitch take him
completely off his square.

423
00:41:19.652 --> 00:41:22.851
I told his ass. we
don't kill the folks.

424
00:41:22.886 --> 00:41:25.524
and we damn sure don't
fuck over nigga's family.

425
00:41:29.728 --> 00:41:32.729
He did both when he
pulled that shit on you.

426
00:41:32.764 --> 00:41:34.566
- You was with him
on that bullshit.

427
00:41:34.601 --> 00:41:36.128
- Prove it. nigga.

428
00:41:36.163 --> 00:41:37.998
I'm one of Chief's finest.

429
00:41:38.033 --> 00:41:41.067
I kill ops. not the folks.

430
00:41:42.675 --> 00:41:46.006
True enough. I trust him with
my life on too many moves.

431
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.680
Had me in a ambush
with the Mexicans.

432
00:41:49.715 --> 00:41:51.308
He didn't give a
fuck how I felt.

433
00:41:52.751 --> 00:41:55.345
You think I'll be over here
pouring out information.

434
00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.688
like y'all don't
got shit else to do.

435
00:41:57.723 --> 00:41:59.283
No. I want what's mine.

436
00:42:00.693 --> 00:42:02.055
And that nigga got it.

437
00:42:03.025 --> 00:42:04.255
- He got it. huh?

438
00:42:06.226 --> 00:42:08.094
- We staying for 30
pounds of heroin.

439
00:42:09.295 --> 00:42:11.097
I put in the most
work on that move.

440
00:42:12.265 --> 00:42:13.935
To leave with a
pound of 10 bands

441
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:15.607
like I'm a motherfucking worker.

442
00:42:15.642 --> 00:42:16.267
- How I know.

443
00:42:18.007 --> 00:42:20.205
you ain't one of them niggas
that killed my people?

444
00:42:21.175 --> 00:42:22.647
And just trying to set up a move

445
00:42:22.682 --> 00:42:24.077
to have me buried next to my BM?

446
00:42:26.411 --> 00:42:29.984
- 'Cause I done already
knocked off this bitch.

447
00:42:54.912 --> 00:42:56.648
She was named dropping.

448
00:42:56.683 --> 00:42:58.980
Holding too much information.

449
00:42:59.015 --> 00:43:01.686
Fucked around with a
turned state witness.

450
00:43:01.721 --> 00:43:04.249
So I put a bullet in the bitch.

451
00:43:04.284 --> 00:43:06.625
I just made sure I
fucked her first.

452
00:43:07.727 --> 00:43:08.660
Nigga was too pussy whipped

453
00:43:08.695 --> 00:43:11.355
to address what I told
him the problem was.

454
00:43:12.765 --> 00:43:14.798
so I handled that
shit accordingly.

455
00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:18.736
You don't gotta with me
a day in life after this.

456
00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:21.002
I'm telling you how
to get your get back.

457
00:43:22.907 --> 00:43:25.402
You won't find a
more reliable source.

458
00:43:25.437 --> 00:43:27.173
This from the horse's mouth.

459
00:43:28.715 --> 00:43:31.177
You could take it
or you can leave.

460
00:43:31.212 --> 00:43:32.409
- I want his location.

461
00:43:32.444 --> 00:43:34.686
- I want 50 bands.

462
00:43:35.788 --> 00:43:38.921
I get a new crib
location and a warehouse.

463
00:43:41.189 --> 00:43:43.728
You just hit me
once you come up.

464
00:43:49.769 --> 00:43:51.362
- How about we lay
your ass down right now

465
00:43:51.397 --> 00:43:52.836
for being suspect?

466
00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:55.971
And I'll find that
warehouse myself.

467
00:43:57.403 --> 00:43:59.007
- Sound like two for one to me.

468
00:44:02.408 --> 00:44:04.881
- Your mama still live
on Woodlawn. nigga?

469
00:44:17.863 --> 00:44:20.094
You need to check up
on her more often.

470
00:44:20.129 --> 00:44:23.735
I ain't playing no stupid
game to win no stupid prize.

471
00:44:26.971 --> 00:44:28.135
I'm bringing you sugar.

472
00:44:29.303 --> 00:44:31.809
Don't return a favor
by handing me no shit.

473
00:44:32.779 --> 00:44:37.012
We can get money. or
we can get greasy.

474
00:44:42.184 --> 00:44:44.481
- 50 bands off the
vault in that warehouse.

475
00:44:47.992 --> 00:44:49.222
How much in there?

476
00:44:51.028 --> 00:44:52.093
- Close to a million.

477
00:45:10.982 --> 00:45:14.412
- Yo nigga socked you
up pretty bad. huh?

478
00:45:17.417 --> 00:45:18.218
Where you from?

479
00:45:20.486 --> 00:45:21.320
- Dad.

480
00:45:26.899 --> 00:45:28.426
is mom coming back?

481
00:45:30.397 --> 00:45:31.836
- I don't know.

482
00:45:35.105 --> 00:45:37.204
But you ain't gonna
lose no sleep over it.

483
00:45:44.213 --> 00:45:48.380
Same routine. same
responsibilities. same curfew.

484
00:45:52.859 --> 00:45:54.518
Now you hold your head up.

485
00:45:54.553 --> 00:45:55.586
Whatever crying you gonna do.

486
00:45:55.621 --> 00:45:58.027
you gonna squeeze that
shit up out you right now.

487
00:46:11.944 --> 00:46:13.405
- Look.

488
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.945
listen.

489
00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.814
learn.

490
00:46:18.247 --> 00:46:20.445
- There's a lesson in
everything you encounter.

491
00:46:22.416 --> 00:46:24.922
but nothing in life is
gonna teach you like love.

492
00:46:27.025 --> 00:46:30.587
It's gonna give you the biggest
smile and the worst pain.

493
00:46:30.622 --> 00:46:32.622
It's good to experience it now.

494
00:46:32.657 --> 00:46:35.163
instead of having it
shell shock you later on.

495
00:46:37.299 --> 00:46:39.970
But one thing I don't want
you getting accustomed to.

496
00:46:41.534 --> 00:46:44.238
and that's living in mystery
over some God damn woman.

497
00:46:47.573 --> 00:46:49.639
It's all right to love.

498
00:46:49.674 --> 00:46:51.916
but when love causes
you to lose yourself.

499
00:46:51.951 --> 00:46:53.214
you better let that bitch go.

500
00:46:55.152 --> 00:46:57.020
And I don't care who she is.

501
00:46:58.287 --> 00:47:00.287
Do we have an understanding?

502
00:47:02.192 --> 00:47:03.026
- Yes sir.

503
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:07.932
- I'll be picking
you up from school.

504
00:47:09.067 --> 00:47:10.297
You got your cell phone?

505
00:47:11.498 --> 00:47:12.130
- Yes.

506
00:47:14.138 --> 00:47:16.633
- Make sure it's off in class.

507
00:47:16.668 --> 00:47:19.603
Power on at- 15.
I'll be texting you.

508
00:47:20.672 --> 00:47:21.880
- All right.

509
00:47:22.982 --> 00:47:24.311
- Bring it here.

510
00:47:33.421 --> 00:47:34.387
Go on upstairs.

511
00:47:34.422 --> 00:47:35.289
Get ready for tomorrow.

512
00:47:35.324 --> 00:47:36.587
Watch your step.

513
00:48:02.989 --> 00:48:05.286
- My clients come from all over.

514
00:48:05.321 --> 00:48:06.958
Japan.

515
00:48:06.993 --> 00:48:08.454
Bangladesh.

516
00:48:08.489 --> 00:48:10.060
South Africa.

517
00:48:10.095 --> 00:48:10.929
Sudan.

518
00:48:12.592 --> 00:48:15.032
They receive a five
star experience

519
00:48:15.067 --> 00:48:18.002
from a McCarran
Airport to our hotel.

520
00:48:18.037 --> 00:48:21.665
Most of the Johns. they
pick up their favorite girl.

521
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:25.977
then they go to the strip
club. then the pot dealer.

522
00:48:26.012 --> 00:48:27.605
But my exclusives.

523
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.741
they want cane.
powder. and pills.

524
00:48:31.776 --> 00:48:34.678
and their fair share
of pussy.

525
00:48:34.713 --> 00:48:37.054
Rich. powerful men.

526
00:48:37.089 --> 00:48:38.957
and it all boils down to pussy.

527
00:48:40.125 --> 00:48:42.092
You put a cute girl on their arm

528
00:48:42.127 --> 00:48:43.962
and they're willing
to spend it all.

529
00:48:48.034 --> 00:48:48.967
You'd do great there.

530
00:48:50.366 --> 00:48:54.071
- Jake. managing your father's
bank is enough for me.

531
00:48:55.239 --> 00:48:57.404
- By enough. you mean
earning a salary?

532
00:48:58.704 --> 00:49:02.112
Honey. you haven't seen bank

533
00:49:03.247 --> 00:49:07.117
until you play in a
circle of billionaires.

534
00:49:08.714 --> 00:49:09.548
Think about it.

535
00:49:16.788 --> 00:49:18.557
How much longer on your friend?

536
00:49:20.198 --> 00:49:22.165
- She's on the elevator.

537
00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.034
- Splendid.

538
00:49:25.203 --> 00:49:26.103
- The door.

539
00:49:36.676 --> 00:49:38.148
Jake. she's here.

540
00:49:40.284 --> 00:49:41.679
- Well. whoopdie-fucking-do.

541
00:49:44.387 --> 00:49:45.815
You always show up to
your business meetings

542
00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:46.649
30 minutes late?

543
00:49:46.684 --> 00:49:48.323
- You wanted the
best in the city.

544
00:49:50.822 --> 00:49:52.723
- Best things come
with a little wait.

545
00:49:54.463 --> 00:49:56.496
Or I could have had you
to pull up in Murder Town

546
00:49:56.531 --> 00:49:59.037
and met with one of
the other workers.

547
00:50:05.441 --> 00:50:07.177
- Murder Town.

548
00:50:07.212 --> 00:50:08.739
No. that wouldn't work.

549
00:50:08.774 --> 00:50:10.576
I mean. I'm not from Chicago.

550
00:50:10.611 --> 00:50:13.150
but I know I don't want to
be going to Murder Town.

551
00:50:14.318 --> 00:50:16.318
If you got some of that
stuff from yesterday.

552
00:50:16.353 --> 00:50:17.484
come on. show it to me.

553
00:50:17.519 --> 00:50:18.353
Let's go.

554
00:50:20.192 --> 00:50:23.127
Mike. this is. uh.

555
00:50:23.162 --> 00:50:24.656
- Call me. Tiff.

556
00:50:26.528 --> 00:50:28.066
- Come on ladies. sit down.

557
00:50:39.904 --> 00:50:42.377
And this is the same from
the little bird on the bag

558
00:50:42.412 --> 00:50:44.577
that I snorted yesterday?

559
00:50:44.612 --> 00:50:46.183
- Straight from the source.

560
00:50:53.819 --> 00:50:56.127
- That's 25.000 in your hand.

561
00:50:58.626 --> 00:51:03.530
- Mike. get the 25.000 out
of the bag next to the bed.

562
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:10.537
Today. Mike.

563
00:51:28.755 --> 00:51:32.163
This is 25.000 hand
over fist. okay?

564
00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.500
And this package. this'll
be traveling with me.

565
00:51:41.636 --> 00:51:43.636
I don't deal with narcotics.

566
00:51:43.671 --> 00:51:46.474
but having quantities
like this is paramount.

567
00:51:48.313 --> 00:51:51.611
I have patrons and I
need to keep them happy.

568
00:51:51.646 --> 00:51:52.579
- Where at?

569
00:51:52.614 --> 00:51:53.712
- Fabulous Las Vegas. of course.

570
00:51:55.914 --> 00:51:58.189
- That's over 2000 miles away.

571
00:51:59.357 --> 00:52:00.851
- Honey. we're
not talking miles.

572
00:52:00.886 --> 00:52:01.885
We're talking money.

573
00:52:14.273 --> 00:52:16.339
- Keisha's gonna
give you my number.

574
00:52:17.672 --> 00:52:19.474
So I'm gonna talk to the team.

575
00:52:22.875 --> 00:52:23.874
Thanks for the plug.

576
00:52:34.425 --> 00:52:35.919
- This is some real boss shit.

577
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.731
Motherfucker. think you gonna-

578
00:52:45.766 --> 00:52:46.930
- I think
you broke my nose!

579
00:52:46.965 --> 00:52:47.764
Broke out of my house!

580
00:52:47.799 --> 00:52:49.570
Don't kick me out!

581
00:52:49.605 --> 00:52:50.604
Bitch. quit your shit. G!

582
00:52:50.639 --> 00:52:51.572
- Come on. mama.

583
00:52:51.607 --> 00:52:53.640
- Get the fuck out my house. G.

584
00:52:53.675 --> 00:52:55.873
You think this shit
make you responsible?

585
00:52:55.908 --> 00:52:59.250
Or make .

586
00:53:01.287 --> 00:53:02.847
- Hey. hey. on that car. gang.

587
00:53:19.305 --> 00:53:23.307
- Nigga. almost put this
whole clip in this bitch.

588
00:53:26.411 --> 00:53:28.004
- You must got good
life insurance. nigga.

589
00:53:28.039 --> 00:53:29.742
- Nah. it ain't
even that. big bro.

590
00:53:29.777 --> 00:53:31.282
It's we into it right now.

591
00:53:33.418 --> 00:53:35.385
- And you still ain't
getting no money.

592
00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.047
- Shit. you know how that go.

593
00:53:38.082 --> 00:53:40.016
PPP done shut everything down.

594
00:53:40.051 --> 00:53:42.986
We out here hitting cars
and knocking over stores.

595
00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:48.629
Big Bitch Betsy gonna
make sure I eat though.

596
00:53:48.664 --> 00:53:49.498
by any means.

597
00:53:55.099 --> 00:53:57.374
- You wanna make
some real money?

598
00:53:57.409 --> 00:53:58.441
- Fuck yeah. nigga.

599
00:54:00.104 --> 00:54:01.840
- Grab a couple of them
that you fuck with.

600
00:54:01.875 --> 00:54:02.973
Y'all hop in the back.

601
00:54:06.814 --> 00:54:08.748
- You know we got
these blicks on us.

602
00:54:11.786 --> 00:54:13.522
- Bring her with you.

603
00:55:10.548 --> 00:55:11.976
- And come on. y'all.

604
00:55:12.011 --> 00:55:14.847
I need at least 2000 damn
bags by the end of this shift.

605
00:55:14.882 --> 00:55:15.947
- Yo. what is y'all doing?

606
00:55:15.982 --> 00:55:17.388
We need to speed it up.

607
00:55:17.423 --> 00:55:18.554
We gotta a line and
more cars pulling up.

608
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:19.984
- If you want
something done right.

609
00:55:20.019 --> 00:55:21.491
you should do it yourself then.

610
00:55:21.526 --> 00:55:22.085
- Up with all that?

611
00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.186
- Y'all heard that man.

612
00:55:23.221 --> 00:55:24.956
Melo. take your way outside
and secure the alley.

613
00:55:24.991 --> 00:55:26.155
- I ain't got no pistol. man.

614
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:27.596
- Tell TY he relieved
and grab his gun.

615
00:55:27.631 --> 00:55:29.125
I'll be out there in a minute.

616
00:55:37.003 --> 00:55:40.510
- Aye yo. Ty. you
can spin off. G.

617
00:55:40.545 --> 00:55:41.775
- Y'all always need
to speed it up.

618
00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:43.040
Y'all ain't moving fast enough.

619
00:55:43.075 --> 00:55:44.140
- I know. man.

620
00:55:45.209 --> 00:55:46.417
Let's go. y'all.

621
00:55:51.116 --> 00:55:51.950
- Aye yo. Ty.

622
00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.150
The fuck is wrong with you?

623
00:56:00.565 --> 00:56:01.124
- Get down!

624
00:56:05.537 --> 00:56:06.470
- It's cool.

625
00:56:06.505 --> 00:56:07.405
Don't move.

626
00:57:04.596 --> 00:57:05.595
- Somebody help this man!

627
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:06.530
Hey. hey. hey.

628
00:57:06.565 --> 00:57:07.630
Somebody help. somebody help!

629
00:57:24.011 --> 00:57:25.483
- Cedric thanks you.

630
00:57:33.086 --> 00:57:35.119
- Pops was the only
father figure I knew.

631
00:57:37.189 --> 00:57:38.661
- You know. it's
been so many years

632
00:57:38.696 --> 00:57:40.256
since I've seen any
of you young men

633
00:57:40.291 --> 00:57:41.994
from the community center.

634
00:57:44.966 --> 00:57:47.703
Besides those that
turned into my children.

635
00:57:52.039 --> 00:57:55.546
Ever since law enforcement
swept through our neighborhoods.

636
00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:58.615
we lost the glue and structure

637
00:57:59.915 --> 00:58:01.750
that made us a good community.

638
00:58:04.623 --> 00:58:06.557
Our vision was in place.

639
00:58:06.592 --> 00:58:08.020
Our direction was set.

640
00:58:09.188 --> 00:58:11.826
Cedric. myself and
so many others.

641
00:58:11.861 --> 00:58:13.597
there was hundreds of us.

642
00:58:15.194 --> 00:58:17.865
We were determined
to erase the stain

643
00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:20.065
that crack inflicted
on our community.

644
00:58:21.706 --> 00:58:24.333
But we were not prepared
to face the government

645
00:58:24.368 --> 00:58:25.906
that wanted to keep us there.

646
00:58:29.307 --> 00:58:31.945
We were on the brink
of a mass incarceration

647
00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:35.652
that caused more detriment
to our families than ever.

648
00:58:49.327 --> 00:58:50.931
But worse is.

649
00:58:52.396 --> 00:58:56.002
those of you who knew the
guidelines to our recovery

650
00:58:57.676 --> 00:59:00.578
and didn't fulfill the
commitment to become leaders.

651
00:59:02.681 --> 00:59:05.682
The leaders that
our organization so
desperately needed.

652
00:59:15.419 --> 00:59:18.156
- I was 17 when them
indictments took place.

653
00:59:20.732 --> 00:59:23.227
and not all of us had
leadership capabilities.

654
00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:29.970
Think about most of our members

655
00:59:30.005 --> 00:59:33.171
coming from broken
homes and shit.

656
00:59:33.206 --> 00:59:34.777
We looked up to the guys.

657
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.912
When pops went down.

658
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:42.213
I ain't had nothing my
mind but trying to survive.

659
00:59:44.316 --> 00:59:45.215
And becoming a father.

660
00:59:48.353 --> 00:59:51.090
made me put a bigger
priority on survival.

661
00:59:51.125 --> 00:59:52.696
- By committing the same acts

662
00:59:52.731 --> 00:59:55.633
that has my husband doing
life in the institution?

663
00:59:57.802 --> 00:59:58.933
- Fucking snake. man.

664
00:59:58.968 --> 01:00:00.231
- That's what I'm saying. man.

665
01:00:00.266 --> 01:00:01.067
- You already know.

666
01:00:02.334 --> 01:00:03.102
- Aye man. somebody
at your door. man.

667
01:00:03.137 --> 01:00:04.840
- Man. fuck that.

668
01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.041
- Put your hands up!
- Get on the ground!

669
01:00:08.076 --> 01:00:09.779
- Get down!
- Down!

670
01:00:19.285 --> 01:00:20.284
- 15 Years ago.

671
01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.057
Cedric spent every
conversation mentioning you.

672
01:00:25.764 --> 01:00:27.764
I had forgotten who you
were until recently.

673
01:00:29.196 --> 01:00:30.329
Now I recall.

674
01:00:32.133 --> 01:00:34.870
you the young kid that he
allowed to live in our attic.

675
01:00:47.918 --> 01:00:49.819
- My moms had drug problems.

676
01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:52.415
- I remember him spending
several hours with you

677
01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:55.286
in that attic. teaching
you the literature.

678
01:00:58.863 --> 01:01:01.831
The positive dignified
principles of growth
and development.

679
01:01:02.933 --> 01:01:04.328
- Why you call me over here?

680
01:01:06.871 --> 01:01:08.068
I mean. everybody dead.

681
01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:11.709
I pay my hommage.

682
01:01:13.977 --> 01:01:15.504
and I don't see none of
these out in the street

683
01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:18.045
taking initiative to
send a old man no money.

684
01:01:19.477 --> 01:01:21.081
Not a dime.

685
01:01:21.116 --> 01:01:22.214
- We don't want your money.

686
01:01:22.249 --> 01:01:23.721
- Well. all right then.

687
01:01:25.956 --> 01:01:26.955
Get your coat. man.

688
01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:29.991
Send my love to him.

689
01:01:30.026 --> 01:01:31.487
- We want your involvement.

690
01:01:35.427 --> 01:01:36.998
You have influence.

691
01:01:38.298 --> 01:01:40.364
You have the knowledge
and the ability

692
01:01:40.399 --> 01:01:43.367
to continue this mission
that is far from over.

693
01:01:45.811 --> 01:01:47.173
Look at the men who follow you.

694
01:01:48.847 --> 01:01:51.144
They follow because
of what you know

695
01:01:51.179 --> 01:01:52.409
and what you're
able to accomplish.

696
01:01:52.444 --> 01:01:54.114
- I got accomplished
being a single father

697
01:01:54.149 --> 01:01:56.149
to a eight year boy.

698
01:01:56.184 --> 01:01:58.052
My time to try to
influence a bunch of niggas

699
01:01:58.087 --> 01:01:59.790
to see a better way
is the quickest way

700
01:01:59.825 --> 01:02:01.253
for me to end up
in a penitentiary.

701
01:02:02.421 --> 01:02:05.389
Just like pops and the
rest of them old heads.

702
01:02:05.424 --> 01:02:07.292
- If the streets
don't kill you first.

703
01:02:07.327 --> 01:02:09.228
- We all got a out
date. now don't we?

704
01:02:11.034 --> 01:02:12.198
- Try telling him that.

705
01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:17.137
What's his future without you?

706
01:02:17.172 --> 01:02:18.809
Who does he have?

707
01:02:18.844 --> 01:02:22.208
As a father. you're not in
a position to be selfish.

708
01:02:22.243 --> 01:02:25.310
- But I'm in a good position
to be smart now. ain't I?

709
01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:37.223
- Very well then.

710
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:03.150
- Yeah.

711
01:03:03.185 --> 01:03:04.481
- I got cash for you. bro.

712
01:03:07.926 --> 01:03:10.454
- I gotta go to Stash house
and grab a few things.

713
01:03:10.489 --> 01:03:12.126
Maybe you can meet me over.

714
01:03:12.161 --> 01:03:14.095
- And I got a buzz
to put in your ear.

715
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:15.360
- All right.

716
01:03:15.395 --> 01:03:16.592
- About a new
business opportunity.

717
01:03:16.627 --> 01:03:19.001
- Aight. shit. listen.

718
01:03:38.154 --> 01:03:42.222
- Stop disrespecting
me. stop disrespecting me.

719
01:03:42.257 --> 01:03:44.356
stop disrespecting!

720
01:03:44.391 --> 01:03:46.655
You will stop disrespecting me!

721
01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:49.493
You will stop disrespecting me!

722
01:03:49.528 --> 01:03:51.363
I didn't do it to you!

723
01:04:13.959 --> 01:04:15.057
- Where K at?

724
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:20.458
She done left the crib a long
time ago and never came back.

725
01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:26.970
- You know Kayla
don't fuck with me.

726
01:04:30.602 --> 01:04:31.942
Last time I seen her.

727
01:04:33.341 --> 01:04:35.605
she was picking up my
baby from the hospital.

728
01:04:37.015 --> 01:04:40.115
Boy. you know you look
just like your granddaddy.

729
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:41.578
just like him.

730
01:04:41.613 --> 01:04:42.779
with a little bit of
your daddy in there. too.

731
01:04:42.814 --> 01:04:44.955
- You know. I find it funny
that she been gone all this time

732
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:46.451
and ain't paid
you not one visit.

733
01:04:48.521 --> 01:04:51.291
That shit don't even
surprise me though.

734
01:04:51.326 --> 01:04:54.327
She'd ran off and left only
child just like you left her.

735
01:04:56.166 --> 01:04:59.662
Whole rotten ass apples don't
fall too far from the tree.

736
01:04:59.697 --> 01:05:00.938
- Rotten apples?

737
01:05:02.304 --> 01:05:03.468
You got a lot of nerve.

738
01:05:04.438 --> 01:05:05.635
You do not know my struggle

739
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:07.373
and you definitely
don't know my pain.

740
01:05:07.408 --> 01:05:08.704
- I don't know about
you running behind

741
01:05:08.739 --> 01:05:09.838
all the more dirty ass hustlers

742
01:05:09.874 --> 01:05:12.015
to the point where you
allowed them to take advantage

743
01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:13.412
of your only God damn daughter.

744
01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:20.089
- You don't know shit!

745
01:05:21.257 --> 01:05:23.356
Get your mother.
this motherfucker!

746
01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:41.143
I tried to raise Kayla
the best I could.

747
01:05:44.214 --> 01:05:46.676
By myself. me.

748
01:05:49.186 --> 01:05:50.416
I couldn't save her.

749
01:05:53.058 --> 01:05:54.750
Shit. I couldn't
even save myself.

750
01:06:04.399 --> 01:06:08.071
My baby has so much talent.

751
01:06:08.106 --> 01:06:10.370
She could sing. she could dance.

752
01:06:19.777 --> 01:06:20.611
Smart.

753
01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:32.491
I couldn't give her her dreams

754
01:06:32.526 --> 01:06:34.427
when I was living
in my own nightmare.

755
01:06:38.565 --> 01:06:40.598
So I had to give her up.

756
01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.538
So I guess that's why
she ended up with you.

757
01:06:51.809 --> 01:06:54.810
And then she told
me she was pregnant.

758
01:06:54.845 --> 01:06:57.087
and I was happy for her.

759
01:06:57.122 --> 01:06:58.154
'Cause she was happy.

760
01:07:03.161 --> 01:07:05.656
So if came over
here to judge me.

761
01:07:08.892 --> 01:07:10.595
you picked the
wrong day to do it.

762
01:07:12.764 --> 01:07:14.566
- I came over here
to make a discovery.

763
01:07:16.603 --> 01:07:18.636
Maliq need to be in
tune with his family.

764
01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:21.837
Least the little bit he do got.

765
01:07:23.148 --> 01:07:24.576
Especially his grandma.

766
01:07:26.481 --> 01:07:28.250
Now I know you over
here fucked up.

767
01:07:29.781 --> 01:07:30.879
but it ain't my
place to deprive him

768
01:07:30.914 --> 01:07:33.222
of a relationship
he should have.

769
01:07:36.293 --> 01:07:38.326
There's enough shit
going on already.

770
01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:43.694
You wanna spend some
time with your grandma?

771
01:07:43.729 --> 01:07:44.563
- Yeah.

772
01:07:50.241 --> 01:07:52.769
- Make sure you put some
food in your refrigerator.

773
01:07:54.344 --> 01:07:56.377
I'm gonna come back over
and pick him up later.

774
01:08:13.396 --> 01:08:15.231
- Of the heaviest
stuff really getting going.

775
01:08:15.266 --> 01:08:16.463
Now through midnight.

776
01:08:16.498 --> 01:08:17.860
we could have some
heavy bands of snow.

777
01:08:17.895 --> 01:08:19.301
especially for areas near-

778
01:08:23.406 --> 01:08:26.242
- I was instructed to
make sure you received it.

779
01:08:26.277 --> 01:08:28.805
If you have any love for my
husband. you'll hear him out.

780
01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.180
- From the north.

781
01:08:30.215 --> 01:08:31.676
moisture coming
in from the south.

782
01:08:31.711 --> 01:08:34.184
That's why we're just
at the beginning stages

783
01:08:34.219 --> 01:08:36.483
of this snow storm. another
storm warning in effect.

784
01:08:36.518 --> 01:08:38.716
Let's talk about what you can
expect for the next six hours

785
01:08:38.751 --> 01:08:40.586
when we expect some of
the heavy stuff to fall.

786
01:08:40.621 --> 01:08:41.818
Here's Rob-

787
01:08:41.853 --> 01:08:44.227
- It's been 20 long
years since we spoke.

788
01:08:48.266 --> 01:08:52.334
The chaos that has the streets
of Chicago in a hellish state

789
01:08:52.369 --> 01:08:54.600
is a direct result
of our actions.

790
01:08:56.505 --> 01:08:57.702
- Gonna
change direction.

791
01:08:57.737 --> 01:08:59.242
become more of a
west or northwest-

792
01:09:02.676 --> 01:09:05.281
- It's the offspring
from the life we live.

793
01:09:06.482 --> 01:09:10.187
reproduced on the same
blocks that we govern.

794
01:09:16.492 --> 01:09:18.393
So much of that blood
is on our hands.

795
01:09:25.534 --> 01:09:26.764
- Now.
- Mm-hm.

796
01:09:28.339 --> 01:09:29.239
Now that's gangsta.

797
01:09:37.942 --> 01:09:39.282
- Yeah.
- Say less.

798
01:09:43.046 --> 01:09:45.618
- We headed to
the warehouse right now.

799
01:09:45.653 --> 01:09:48.291
I got Soda on it
to the stash stop.

800
01:09:48.326 --> 01:09:49.622
We inside.

801
01:09:49.657 --> 01:09:50.491
- On my way.

802
01:10:12.482 --> 01:10:13.646
- Time is up. OG.

803
01:10:15.815 --> 01:10:18.354
- What the fuck y'all
little niggas doing in here?

804
01:10:18.389 --> 01:10:20.389
- My mama told me
about your ass. nigga.

805
01:10:22.525 --> 01:10:24.723
- And she told you I ain't
nothing to fuck with.

806
01:10:26.694 --> 01:10:27.560
- As I think back.

807
01:10:30.665 --> 01:10:32.830
I could have did things
a whole lot better.

808
01:10:35.065 --> 01:10:37.967
There's plenty of room in here
for the lost and misguided.

809
01:10:40.103 --> 01:10:43.313
but a shame for a man who
possessed the keys of prosperity

810
01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:46.514
to be in here next to me.

811
01:11:46.675 --> 01:11:49.412
And I want you to
think about that.

812
01:12:11.964 --> 01:12:14.437
But we don't get a chance
to rewrite history.

813
01:12:15.638 --> 01:12:18.606
but we do get a chance to
build a more promising future.

814
01:12:21.105 --> 01:12:22.907
- Every dog ass
nigga got their day.

815
01:12:25.945 --> 01:12:27.516
- You don't wanna
do that. Ritchie.

816
01:12:44.161 --> 01:12:46.469
- You hold the answers.

817
01:12:46.504 --> 01:12:48.768
The blueprint to the change

818
01:12:49.936 --> 01:12:52.772
that our community
so desperately need.

819
01:13:00.012 --> 01:13:02.782
- This ain't how it's
supposed to go down.

820
01:13:02.817 --> 01:13:05.488
- A man can't live
by bread alone.

821
01:13:24.641 --> 01:13:28.203
- You just gonna do
this to me. nigga?

822
01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:30.810
All you niggas?

823
01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:34.913
I'm a fucking vulture. too.

824
01:13:36.785 --> 01:13:39.522
I put in work and fed a
lot of you niggas. man.

825
01:13:50.601 --> 01:13:52.964
Vulture City for life. right?

826
01:14:27.572 --> 01:14:29.572
- Your Pop's gonna
be proud of you. boy.

827
01:14:32.203 --> 01:14:33.402
Be sure you tell your Mama

828
01:14:33.438 --> 01:14:36.172
I'm a send that care package
to him in the morning. aight?

829
01:16:20.751 --> 01:16:21.684
- Hello?

830
01:16:21.719 --> 01:16:22.982
- Yeah. he just left.

831
01:16:23.017 --> 01:16:24.852
He took Maliq with him.

832
01:18:32.047 --> 01:18:33.816
- Welcome home. G.

833
01:18:43.322 --> 01:18:44.926
- What's his future without you?

834
01:18:49.295 --> 01:18:50.899
- No. no!

835
01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:51.801
- You're under
arrest for the murder

836
01:18:51.836 --> 01:18:54.199
of Robert Ratford. AKA. Joe.

837
01:18:54.234 --> 01:18:57.807
Anything you say can and
will be used against you.

838
01:18:59.943 --> 01:19:01.173
- We could choose our actions.

839
01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.275
but we can't choose
our consequences.

840
01:19:11.581 --> 01:19:14.186
I want you to think about that.

841
01:19:20.557 --> 01:19:22.557
Looking forward to
seeing Maliq someday.

842
01:19:23.868 --> 01:19:27.463
I know he has in him.
what you have in you.

843
01:19:48.123 --> 01:19:51.454
And for the sake of the
next generation to come.

844
01:19:51.489 --> 01:19:53.962
your son's generation.

845
01:19:53.997 --> 01:19:56.833
somebody has to
stop the bleeding.
