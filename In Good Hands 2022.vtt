00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.240
<i>Yes.</i>

4
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.080
<i>That guy there was my doctor.</i>

5
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.000
<i>The one who looked like a Nazi officer.</i>

6
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.880
<i>He said I have five months to live.</i>

7
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.680
<i>I said. "Are you sure it's not three?"</i>

8
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.080
<i>He insisted it was five.</i>

9
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.840
<i>Maybe a month longer or shorter.</i>

10
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.080
<i>To avoid being a pest.</i>
<i>I didn't inquire further.</i>

11
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.240
<i>Looking back. what can I say?</i>

12
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.440
<i>I have had a good life actually.</i>

13
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.280
<i>I've lived my life to the fullest.</i>

14
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.320
<i>I'm not afraid.</i>

15
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.680
<i>I just have one big problem.</i>

16
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.080
<i>Or you could say he's little.</i>

17
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.600
Put it there.

18
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.880
Well then.

19
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280
let's play First Word.

20
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.680
Bed.

21
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.240
Pillow.

22
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.120
Sleep.

23
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.440
Clock.

24
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.000
Greenwich meridian.

25
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.720
Don't lie. that's not a thing!

26
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.720
Great. you start whining right away.

27
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.680
It <i>is </i>a thing.

28
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.720
Sandwich merman?

29
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.720
What?

30
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.320
Now. <i>that's </i>not a thing. What?

31
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.920
You're making stuff up!

32
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Okay. I don't want you to feel that way.

33
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.280
Okay. fine.

34
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.720
I have great news for you. buddy.

35
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.280
What?

36
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.360
It's time.

37
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.920
Really?

38
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.160
Really.

39
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.280
One. two. three. four!

40
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.160
<i>Hey Dad. hamam that. yeah</i>

41
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.680
<i>Hey Dad. hamam it. yeah</i>

42
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.560
<i>Hey Dad. hamam it. yeah</i>

43
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.320
This is my favorite photo.

44
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.480
Why?

45
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.440
It's the only one with the three of us.

46
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.640
What happens when you die?

47
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.280
Can. you're asking that again?

48
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.440
My dear…

49
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.760
Can you scratch my back?

50
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.520
Sure.

51
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.560
I'll scratch your back.

52
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.840
Ready for landing?

53
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.200
Off you go.

54
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.360
All right.

55
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.600
Munu Munu.

56
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.680
Munu Munu.

57
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.960
Of course.

58
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.040
There you go.

59
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.960
Good night.

60
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.920
Good night.

MON-TUE-WED-THU-FRI-SAT-SUN

62
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.000
Good job. kids. Good job.

63
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.640
Take turns. Go on.

64
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.680
There you go.

65
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.640
Good job. dear!

66
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.880
Amazing. Good job. everyone.

67
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.680
Can?

68
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.480
Yes. Mom?

69
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.960
Will you ever go to school?

70
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.040
Nope.

71
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.120
I won't.

72
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.400
Good job. guys. Let's go.

73
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.000
Come on. back to the classroom.

74
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.720
You know you should go to school
at some point. right?

75
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.720
For. like. 15 years?

76
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.640
I don't know. Maybe you should go directly
to university?

77
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.320
You can take your backpack.

78
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.640
And get on the ferry on your own. right?

79
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.560
-Is there anyone on Görkem's side?
-Nope.

80
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.440
-Your dad?
-He wouldn't.

81
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.960
Can! You fell off that bench
just the other day.

82
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.480
Maybe you can go downstairs for me
and have a dessert?

83
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.640
Yay. dessert!

84
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.400
-Careful.
-Thanks.

85
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.720
You're welcome.

86
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.040
I'll take care of Can.

87
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.440
Don't worry about that.

88
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.480
Yeah. sure.

89
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.920
You guys will go
from one party to another.

90
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.480
Yeah? You could do as I say
and find someone.

91
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.160
Melisa. if it were a man in your shoes.
he would have already found a future mom.

92
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.720
Right? Great idea.

93
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.200
A man to take care of Can once I'm gone.

94
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.720
A man. a husband.

95
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.560
I've never thought of that.

96
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.760
Why don't you let someone into your life?

97
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.360
All right. enough.

98
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.960
I'll be waiting downstairs.

99
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.200
Enjoy your food.

100
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.400
I don't understand
why you're acting like a lone wolf.

101
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.440
Yes. Can is a little jealous.
but I'll take care of that.

102
00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.240
Here. I'll handle that now.

103
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.320
Can. my cutie-pie.
I want to ask you something.

104
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.720
Your mom and I are discussing something.

105
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.840
Who do you think is right. her or me?

106
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.000
You. of course.

107
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.400
Yes. of course I'm right.

108
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.920
I'll make you a list of candidates.
and you'll pick someone.

109
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.960
It's that simple. okay?

110
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.320
Candidates?

111
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.360
Dear. come here. please.

112
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.320
Yes. sir.

113
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.640
I'd like chia pudding
and a nice cortado. please.

114
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.680
Of course.

115
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.920
Can. let's play on your tablet. Come on.

116
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.240
Let's find your tablet. Where is it?

117
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.200
Let's go.

118
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.040
I wonder if I should get married.

119
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.480
To that blond customer
who called you "dear"?

120
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.000
Ew. no way.

121
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.520
No. I was just thinking about it.

122
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.080
Would it be so bad
if I had someone in my life?

123
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.760
He'd take care of you
if something happened to me.

124
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.360
-You wouldn't be alone.
-Nothing will happen to you.

125
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.160
Have I done something to upset you?

126
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.400
No. baby.
You haven't done anything to upset me.

127
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.000
I'm sorry.

128
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.280
-You won't get married. right?
-I won't.

129
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.120
Promise? You're not lying. right?

130
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.480
Promise. What's something I never do?

131
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.160
You never lie. Right?

132
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.200
I never lie to you. Right.

133
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.400
Go on. watch some TV.

134
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.680
-Hello.
-Hello.

135
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.200
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

136
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.280
One black filtered coffee. please.

137
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.520
-Sure.
-No milk.

138
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.040
Hey. spongy!

139
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.080
Yeah. the spongy. We'll get that too.

140
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.520
Sure. it's 23 liras.

141
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.440
23 liras… Here you go.

142
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.920
Can you pay in change?

143
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.520
-I have change!
-You do? I have…

144
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.240
I have ten liras here.

145
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.960
Just give me 13 of those coins.

146
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.320
One. two.

147
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.280
three. four.

148
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.080
five…

149
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.200
-Oops.
-Oops!

150
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.200
-Wait. let's recount.
-Okay. we'll recount.

151
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.240
Go ahead.

152
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.160
What?

153
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.120
I'm in a hurry.

154
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.640
We are too.

155
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.920
Oh. really?

156
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.960
Yeah. I guess
you can wait for two minutes.

157
00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.600
Go ahead and count it.

158
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.520
One.

159
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.320
two.

160
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.920
three…

161
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.240
Four. five. six. seven. eight.
nine. ten. eleven. twelve. thirteen.

162
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.840
That's it.

163
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.880
He's a kid. What's wrong with you?

164
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.720
I just want to order.
Do I have to wait all day?

165
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.320
Yes. you do
because he's learning how to count.

166
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.120
Let's start over. Can. One…

167
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.560
If he's just learning it now.
we'll be here until tomorrow.

168
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.120
You want to hit me too?

169
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.080
You can order here.

170
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.160
Please.

171
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.560
I'll get this spongy too.

172
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.920
-What can I get you?
-Orange juice.

173
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.120
Okay.

174
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.560
Keep the change. Thank you.

175
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.240
Let's go.

176
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.080
-Hi. welcome.
-Thanks. A pack of cigarettes. please.

177
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.000
Sure.

178
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.840
FINANCIAL
BIKE WHISPERER

179
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.720
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

180
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.280
Come on. we already got one of those.

181
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.880
I'll buy a new one later.

182
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.920
-Melisa?
-Yes?

183
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.960
Try and complain about this. Check it out.

184
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.720
-Is that the profile you opened for me?
-Yes.

185
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.560
Close it! I told you a thousand times.
I don't want it.

186
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.560
Are you stupid? Just close it.

187
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.960
It's just nonsense.

188
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.760
Dear. could you come here?

189
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.000
Enough with that "dear" shit.

190
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.320
I'd like a strong and tasty Americano.

191
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.680
Right away.

192
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.920
What do you want?

193
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.800
What do you think?

194
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.520
-Hi. Welcome.
-Thanks.

195
00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.360
-A pack of cigarettes. please.
-Sure.

196
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.120
Thanks. Have a good day.

197
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.040
-Have a great day at work.
-Thanks.

198
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.160
Let's go.

199
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.360
Fatoş.

200
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.440
Fatoş. what are you eating?

201
00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.160
Don't you see the hair in it?

202
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.760
Fatma!

203
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.920
Okay. I'm sorry.
I know I shouted a little but…

204
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.680
I think you're right.

205
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.440
I can let someone into my life.

206
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.720
It might be good for Can.

207
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.160
-What?
-I guess.

208
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:18.920
How about him?

209
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.040
No. I have someone in mind.

210
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.800
-Who?
-You know that bike whisperer guy?

211
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.320
Fırtına. Fırat Fırtına.

212
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.760
That Fırtına guy?

213
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.760
Great. cool.

214
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.440
No fucking way.

215
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.960
Fırat Fırtına.

216
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.640
Let's see… Who else?

217
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.240
Oh. you're serious?

218
00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.760
Do you realize what you're saying?

219
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.120
And I'm the stupid one?

220
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.040
Girl. you think he'd make a good father?

221
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.120
He's always in the tabloids.
He finds a different chick every week.

222
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.480
Do you believe
he could be a good father? Come on!

223
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.640
Plus. where is this coming from?
It's so random.

224
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.920
Let's just say I followed the signs.

225
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.160
Okay. boomer.

226
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.240
But there is something else. Can.

227
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.400
Can will eat him alive.

228
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.960
No. they've already met.

229
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.280
They're on good terms. It's cute.

230
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280
Excuse me?

231
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:41.960
Where are you going?

232
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.040
I told you. I'm meeting my friend.

233
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.720
Hold on.

234
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.360
That dress is fire.
but maybe it's too feminine?

235
00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.400
I don't know. I got it from Ayşe.

236
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.480
Listen. I looked him up.

237
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.240
We know he is a cyclist.

238
00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.320
And you know Nostalgia in Ortaköy?

239
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.000
He's one of the owners.
He's there every night.

240
00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.000
But he's an absolute douche.

241
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.040
A douche?

242
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:12.960
Douche.

243
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.200
Who is that?

244
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.560
Who is what?

245
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.840
-Here.
-Oh?

246
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.000
But you can't sleep without it.

247
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.320
Yes. so you have to come back early.

248
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.200
You think you're sly?

249
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.040
Yes.

250
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:39.720
Are you the man of this house?

251
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.880
Are you the head of this household?

252
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.600
Are you my precious baby?

253
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.520
Okay. don't look at me like that.
I promise to come home early.

254
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.400
Okay. I promise.

255
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.920
We are finally alone.

256
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.040
-Fatoş…
-Can!

257
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.120
-This guy is Azerbaijani.
-From Baku?

258
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.120
-What?
-From Baku.

259
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.520
From Baku. exactly.

260
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.000
-Guys. I'm going.
-Just wait.

261
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.960
Quick! You drink so slowly.

262
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.040
We can't make money if you're so slow.

263
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.600
Let's drink again.

264
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.920
Cenk. I'm bringing you drinks.

265
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.840
Excuse me!

266
00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.920
-Some water. please.
-Koray. ten vodka shots.

267
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.160
Water.

268
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.120
Hey. how are you?

269
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.880
Can Little Monster count to 13 now?

270
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.680
-Are you always so annoying?
-Annoying?

271
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.200
Yeah.

272
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.920
I have lovely one-syllable curses
for guys like you.

273
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.760
Koray. what's a one-syllable curse?

274
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.720
Dick.

275
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.960
Thanks. Koray.

276
00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.520
Thank you. Koray.

277
00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.440
Calling me a "dick" wasn't nice.
I'm offended.

278
00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.840
What do you want me to do?

279
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.200
Water's enough. Thanks.

280
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.440
Excuse me. everyone!

281
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.880
This lady called me a dick.
Did you know that?

282
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.840
I didn't expect that from her.

283
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.320
I thought
that one-syllable curse was "scum."

284
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.920
She said "dick."

285
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.400
Koray. bring more.

286
00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.160
Okay. that's enough. No.

287
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.720
Why? Would your husband get mad?

288
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.480
But you don't have a ring.
You should wear it. Shame on you.

289
00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.920
Can I tell you what you have in mind?

290
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.840
Please. go ahead.

291
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.600
You talk about marriage
as bait. and I fall for it.

292
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.880
I tell you that I'm not married.
which is true.

293
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.280
Then you tell Koray
to get us another round of drinks.

294
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.440
I accept it.

295
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.600
Then I get drunk. you get drunk.

296
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.080
Maybe we dance a bit.

297
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.760
Then you say. "I'm so drunk.
Let's go to my place. It's really close."

298
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.160
"We'll have coffee and sober up."
I accept because I'm stupid.

299
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.600
I go with you. It turns out
that you don't have coffee at home.

300
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.200
But I'm stupid. so I don't mind
and I say. "Let's make love!"

301
00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.720
Then we make love.
which probably doesn't last long.

302
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.160
Then I want to cuddle with you.

303
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.680
See. I'm still stupid.

304
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.320
In the morning.
you leave and I go back home.

305
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.680
That's it. How is my story?

306
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.280
You know what? It sounds great.

307
00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.080
But to fix the plot holes
and errors in your story…

308
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.120
One. my place is not close at all.

309
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.080
Two. coffee?
Even you wouldn't fall for that.

310
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.640
You are a little stupid.

311
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.680
Three. you are very judgmental
about my performance time.

312
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.320
but I forgive you.

313
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.120
I just wanted to buy you a drink.

314
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.160
Because of the argument
at the café the other day.

315
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.720
Normally. you're on the list of women
I'd never approach.

316
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.960
Oh. "list of women"!

317
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.000
-You are that picky?
-Yeah.

318
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.800
Who don't you approach. moms with kids?

319
00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.960
No. And moms generally have kids.
by the way.

320
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.400
Then what's the problem. smarty-pants?

321
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.560
You don't interest me.
You're too predictable.

322
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.200
I can tell your next move.
You're not my type.

323
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.960
Maybe because
I don't want to interest you?

324
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.200
I'd get your attention now if I wanted to.

325
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.560
You know what? I'm glad you didn't bother.

326
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.720
Say hi to Little Monster.

327
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.640
Koray. send them off.

328
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.080
You're still drinking that!

329
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.000
<i>Before I died</i>

330
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.840
<i>I had many lovers</i>

331
00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.320
<i>Before I died</i>

332
00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.480
<i>I made countless errors</i>

333
00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.080
<i>Despite everything</i>

334
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.800
<i>I regret nothing</i>

335
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.320
<i>Despite everything</i>

336
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.240
<i>I regret nothing</i>

337
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.720
<i>But still</i>

338
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.040
<i>But still</i>

339
00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.040
<i>I sometimes think</i>

340
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.360
<i>I sometimes think</i>

341
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.160
<i>Maybe one day</i>

342
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.840
<i>Maybe one day</i>

343
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.600
<i>I'll live again</i>

344
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.520
<i>I'll live again</i>

345
00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.720
<i>All my loves</i>

346
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.960
<i>All my loves</i>

347
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.880
<i>Oh God. were they just lies?</i>

348
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.920
<i>Oh God. were they just lies?</i>

349
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.720
<i>I'm so alone</i>

350
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.760
<i>I'm so alone</i>

351
00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.120
<i>I'm slowly wasting away</i>

352
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.800
<i>Wasting away</i>

353
00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.040
I thought you were leaving.

354
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.120
I was.

355
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.520
I wanted to get your attention
before I left.

356
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.440
Fırat.

357
00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.600
See you.

358
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.480
Sure. we can talk about it
after a certain point…

359
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.560
It's unhealthy.

360
00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.120
And don't smoke on an empty stomach.

361
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.600
Fine. what are you buying me?

362
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.600
Whatever you want.

363
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.280
-Let's go then.
-Wait. come back…

364
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.680
I'm in trouble with those guys.

365
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.120
Let's get a taxi.

366
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.880
I forgot my wallet in my car.

367
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.160
Oh. stop it.

368
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.600
You don't look so cool right now.

369
00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.800
"I forgot my wallet in my car.
I don't know where I parked."

370
00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.080
I think these are
high school-level excuses.

371
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.880
No. I swear.
I left my wallet in the glove box.

372
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.800
Yeah. sure.

373
00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.920
Sure. it's because I'm a freeloader.

374
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.720
Let me find a car…

375
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.680
I get it. you won't stop talking about it.

376
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.800
Come on. let's go.

377
00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.080
We don't need a car.

378
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.520
Come with me.

379
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.720
Don't be annoying
and question the hygiene here.

380
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.280
Who do you think I am?

381
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.600
Right!

382
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.640
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

383
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.360
FUAT'S STUFFED MUSSELS

384
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.000
Fuat. we want 20 more of these.
With lots of lemon.

385
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.640
But my name is Selami.

386
00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.800
Fuat. you're making me look like a fool
in front of her. Bring 20 more.

387
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.960
Makes sense.

388
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.280
I'll be right back.

389
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.440
Want some beer?

390
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.640
Do you have change?

391
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.600
Yes. Mr. Freeloader.

392
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.600
Go on. order some.

393
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.120
But you can't order here.
You have to go and buy it.

394
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.800
That's fine. Just give me the money.

395
00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.640
Fine.

396
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.400
So. tell me about yourself.

397
00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.600
I shouldn't.
I don't want you to cry or something.

398
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.440
Why? Are you dying?

399
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.040
Yes.

400
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.520
I have five months left.

401
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.440
Don't they normally say "three months"?

402
00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.640
That's what I said. it should be three!
But he said. "No. five."

403
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.200
Maybe a month longer or shorter.

404
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.800
Sounds like a great doctor.

405
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.720
Yeah.

406
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:35.880
Munu Munu.

407
00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.680
Can's toy. He can't sleep without it.

408
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.800
Munu Munu?

409
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.120
-He calls it Munu Munu?
-Yeah.

410
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.400
It's cute! He never shows his cute side.

411
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.960
You know I won't insult
my kid with you. right?

412
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.160
Can I tell you something?

413
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.880
It'd be fun.

414
00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.320
You know. as a man who doesn't like kids.
you should tell me about yourself.

415
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.760
Why bicycles?

416
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.240
I loved them as a kid.

417
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.760
And I inherited the company from my dad.

418
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.680
But it was almost bankrupt
when my dad died.

419
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.320
I was doing even worse than the company.

420
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.640
Thankfully. things have improved.

421
00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.360
My dad and I used to fight a lot.

422
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.480
I'd drink and pass out somewhere.
He'd come and get me.

423
00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.720
He'd say.
"You'll die in a bar corner. you prick."

424
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.520
How did your dad die?

425
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.840
Cirrhosis.

426
00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.480
Sorry.

427
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.400
And Can? Little Monster?
Does he go to school?

428
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.760
He's in kindergarten.
He'll go to school next year.

429
00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.400
but he hates it.

430
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.480
Why?

431
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.360
Because of me.

432
00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.400
I caused it.

433
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.880
We had such a beautiful life…

434
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.920
Just him and me. Just the two of us.

435
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.960
Completely happy.

436
00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.880
I didn't need anyone.

437
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.680
I didn't let anyone into my life.

438
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.680
Do you regret it?

439
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.240
-Regret what?
-Not letting anyone into your life.

440
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.480
No.

441
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.200
I have five more months.
It's still not too late.

442
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.120
-Should we go?
-No. this is nice.

443
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.360
Let's go.

444
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.640
Let's go.

445
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.640
-Oh. fuck.
-What?

446
00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.960
Munu Munu is missing.

447
00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:54.960
We'll find it.

448
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.560
How? Where can it be?
It was here just a second ago.

449
00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.680
Okay. calm down.

450
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.960
I have to find it.
I can't go home without it.

451
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.200
-We'll buy a new one.
-From where?

452
00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.120
How do we find a new one?

453
00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.600
I can't go home.

454
00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.640
Melisa. it's too late.

455
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.960
I promise. I'll find you a new one.

456
00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.600
"I'm meeting an old friend."

457
00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.120
Are we going to talk about that now?

458
00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.560
No.

459
00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.960
It was just a night. It's over now.

460
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.320
And I upset Can.

461
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.880
Do you know what your problem is?

462
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.360
What?

463
00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.480
You think.

464
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.400
Honestly.

465
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.440
You think constantly.

466
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.160
Just let it go.

467
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.640
Don't think too hard.

468
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.920
Just live your life freely.

469
00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.360
Do you remember how we met?

470
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.320
It was about three years ago.

471
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.920
I was in the storage room?

472
00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.520
You were in love.
You were crying there like a loser.

473
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.920
Poor thing.

474
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.680
And you tried to console me.
speaking like my grandma.

475
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.000
You are amazing.

476
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.000
What did we do afterward?

477
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.720
No. Please. really.

478
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.600
-Yes. Oh. yes.
-I really don't want to.

479
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.080
I can't deal with that now.

480
00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.960
You can. You have to.

481
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.800
Starting now!

482
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.120
Hello. Fırat?

483
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.640
<i>You weren't sleeping. right?</i>

484
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.800
No. but Can is sleeping.

485
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.240
<i>Oh. okay.</i>

486
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.280
<i>-You know what?</i>
-What?

487
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.120
Shall we have dinner tomorrow?

488
00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.160
I know a quiet fish restaurant.
Do you like fish?

489
00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.720
I do. but…

490
00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.800
I can't leave Can.

491
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.360
Little Monster can come too.

492
00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.760
Are you sure?

493
00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.320
<i>I mean…</i>

494
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.520
How bad could it be?

495
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.760
I mean…

496
00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.040
Don't regret it later.

497
00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.400
He'll eat. right?

498
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.760
Sure.

499
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.320
He is never fussy. but…

500
00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.920
Great. See you tomorrow then.

501
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Good night.

502
00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.320
Okay. great. Good night.

503
00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.760
Who was it?

504
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.280
Can. my love.

505
00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.720
Can you please be
the world's sweetest kid tomorrow?

506
00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.720
Shall we start?

507
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.000
-Enjoy your food.
-Enjoy your food.

508
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.640
Why are we here?

509
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.240
I told you.

510
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:28.040
Brother Fırat wanted to apologize
for the scene at the café the other day.

511
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.200
I don't have a brother.

512
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.000
Uncle Fırat wanted to apologize
for the scene at the café the other day.

513
00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.480
I don't have an uncle either.

514
00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.800
-How about just Fırat?
-What's just Fırat?

515
00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.720
Let's leave. I want to leave.

516
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.640
But we talked about it at home?

517
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.400
Give me a break!

518
00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.600
Can!

519
00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.720
You wouldn't believe
the amount of TV he watches.

520
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.360
It's all because of TV.

521
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.480
What is that movie you watch all the time?
The one with cars?

522
00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.960
<i>Fast & Angry?</i>
Or <i>Calm Down. Sit. Stop Embarrassing Me?</i>

523
00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.040
Or <i>That's Enough. Just Sit Down?</i>
What was it?

524
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.120
<i>-Fast & Furious.</i>
-Thank you.

525
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.840
You'll pay if we don't leave.

526
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.000
Fırat sells bikes. Did you know that?

527
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.440
I don't care!

528
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.960
Stop being difficult. Eat your food.

529
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.560
Go on. Enjoy it. Please.

530
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.560
You burned the tablecloth?

531
00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.800
How could you burn the tablecloth?
Explain it to me.

532
00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.080
What am I supposed to do?
What's wrong with you?

533
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.040
I accidentally knocked it over.

534
00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.520
Oh. please. As if I don't know you.

535
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.040
I wasn't born yesterday.

536
00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.680
Do you realize that?

537
00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.400
We won't see that man again.

538
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.280
Because nobody would want to see us!

539
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.520
If I were in his shoes.
I'd turn around and run.

540
00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.440
And that's what he'll do.

541
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.680
No. don't answer it! We aren't here!

542
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.120
Can. be quiet!

543
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.520
Hello. Fırat?

544
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.520
Please forgive us. I'm truly sorry.

545
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.680
Is Can there?

546
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:41.880
Yes.

547
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.640
Here he is. Just a second.

548
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.520
He wants you.

549
00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.000
Be nice.

550
00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.640
Please.

551
00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.840
What? What do you want?

552
00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.600
And?

553
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.400
Okay.

554
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.960
Fırat and I are going
to a car race this weekend.

555
00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.880
Just us. You're not invited.

556
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.120
Shall we dry your hair?

557
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.080
Later.

558
00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.360
Okay.

559
00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.360
Drive carefully!

560
00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.400
-You put your helmet on?
-Yeah. just go.

561
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.640
We'll miss them.

562
00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.600
It's fine. We're in Istanbul.
They'll get stuck in traffic.

563
00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.840
Don't be scared. Gen Z is here.

564
00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.680
Hold tight!

565
00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.600
Go a bit faster.

566
00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:34.360
He is a CEO!
He wouldn't do anything to a kid.

567
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.400
I'm not scared of him. I'm scared of Can.

568
00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.400
Right.

569
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:39.960
Stop.

570
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.320
-What?
-Stop.

571
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.760
-Why? What happened?
-Can you stop?

572
00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.600
Why did they stop?

573
00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.800
How would I know?

574
00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.520
What can I do to make you
leave my mom alone?

575
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.560
What can I ask for. exactly?

576
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.080
If it's money. I have none.

577
00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.160
Bitcoin? Ripple? Ethereum?

578
00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.360
I'll check the house.

579
00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.600
We'll be late for the race.
Little Monster.

580
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.920
I don't want the race.

581
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.920
Do you think I'm stupid?

582
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.360
What do you want with my mom?

583
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.400
Yes.

584
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.120
I think I underestimated you.

585
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.320
Answer the question.

586
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.160
What do I want with your mom?

587
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.440
I want to be her friend.

588
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.040
Give me a break.

589
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.560
No.

590
00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.120
You can't be my mom's friend.

591
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.280
Why? Is it bad to be friends?

592
00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.560
Don't you have any?

593
00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:42.920
I have my mom.

594
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.320
That doesn't count. Who else?

595
00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.440
What? You have no friends?

596
00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.760
Where are we going?

597
00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.000
It's a surprise.

598
00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.600
-Step on it.
-Calm down.

599
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.840
Come on. we'll lose them.

600
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.800
Fine!

601
00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.600
Why are we here?

602
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.920
There are dogs here.
They are our best friends.

603
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.280
Don't you think so?

604
00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.080
What does it have to do with Mom?

605
00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.240
Is Mom a dog?

606
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.800
I thought you'd have a friend.

607
00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.400
-Melisa.
-What?

608
00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.560
Let's have a look.

609
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.360
Look. See?

610
00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.720
So cute.

611
00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.600
Hey. look at the dog.

612
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.880
Doggie. you are so cute.

613
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.880
-Hi.
-Hi.

614
00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.400
Hi.

615
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.960
I'm Fatoş. I'm like his second mom.

616
00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:04.880
Hi. Fırat.

617
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.320
Okay. dear. Thanks.

618
00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.800
Thank you. I got it now.

619
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.920
Go.

620
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.200
-What's up?
-I'm good.

621
00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.920
You followed us here?

622
00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:26.640
You brought him here so that
he would understand we can be friends?

623
00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.880
Yes.

624
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.600
How is it related? Am I a dog. Fırat?

625
00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.800
You two can't think like that.

626
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.360
He is old enough for military service.
but he has never had a friend.

627
00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.360
Because I'm his friend.

628
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.320
Okay. Fine. Melisa.

629
00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.520
I tried to do something nice.
but it didn't work.

630
00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.680
I'm done.

631
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.720
Why does it concern you? Why do you care?

632
00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.400
Because…

633
00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.600
Because I really like you.

634
00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.360
Can is interesting too.

635
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.920
But it's more about you. Okay?

636
00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.600
Okay.

637
00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.840
Mom!

638
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.120
Hey there! Hey…

639
00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.360
Mom. can Şirin come over?

640
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.920
She can't. You know how tiny our place is.

641
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.440
So what?

642
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.240
Can. please.

643
00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.880
It's a no. okay? Don't insist. all right?

644
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.680
Talk her into it if you're her friend.

645
00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.800
Can Şirin come over. Melisa?

646
00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.360
She is so cute.

647
00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.320
My friend.
why can't Şirin come over to your place?

648
00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.400
She is so cute. She can stay there.

649
00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.920
And Can could play with her at your place.

650
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Please?

651
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.080
Please?

652
00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.040
-Okay. fine.
-Yay!

653
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.520
But you'll take care of her.

654
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.600
Of course. Who else?

655
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.920
This is not Şirin at all.

656
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.080
Şirin was that pretty girl with long hair.

657
00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.760
I guess they don't like each other.

658
00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.560
Maybe. before it's too late…

659
00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.920
Maybe we should rehome Şirin quickly?

660
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.280
I think he'll love her.
Maybe he's just comparing her to the girl.

661
00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.200
I have no idea
how he could chat her up so fast.

662
00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.520
Good job.

663
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.320
She keeps looking at me.

664
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.600
Şirin?

665
00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.000
Don't call her Şirin.

666
00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.920
You name her. boss.
What should we call her?

667
00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.480
Fırat.

668
00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.320
Can?

669
00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.400
Do you like Fırat?

670
00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.040
The dog?

671
00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.160
Yeah.

672
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.080
I don't know. Maybe.

673
00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.840
So should we all maybe become friends?

674
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.080
Fırat. you. me. and Fırat.

675
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.520
Fırat the dog is fine.

676
00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.160
But not the other one.

677
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.760
Here you go. sir.

678
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.240
We don't have ice-cream sandwiches?

679
00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.880
Milk is basically the same thing.

680
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.480
Can. Brother Fırat is coming today.

681
00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.080
Dear?

682
00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.920
Could you come here?

683
00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.320
Is "dear" appropriate. dear?

684
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.600
Sorry?

685
00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.120
I just meant it
in the way you address everyone.

686
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.120
Is that so?

687
00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:22.080
You should apologize to the lady.

688
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:29.400
-I'm sorry. madam.
-It's all good. sir.

689
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.320
-Is there anything else I can do for you?
-Apologize to her son.

690
00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.880
I'm sorry. young man.

691
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.000
What's up?

692
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.880
We need to talk.

693
00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.520
Okay.

694
00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.240
SECONDHAND STORE

695
00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.440
Here we are.

696
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.960
What's going on?

697
00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.280
Let me guess.

698
00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.760
"Leave my mom alone."

699
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.880
No. I'll try something else.

700
00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:26.120
What the hell? What's going on?

701
00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.000
Who broke my window? Huh?

702
00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.560
Kids… They should be supervised
at this young age.

703
00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.960
What happened. buddy?

704
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.920
I wonder where his parents are.

705
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:39.920
Dad?

706
00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:41.720
Who? Me?

707
00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.920
Get back here. you jackass!

708
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.800
-Stop!
-Pay for the window!

709
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.800
-Come back!
-Pay for the window!

710
00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:59.840
-Pay for it!
-Pay for the window! Pay…

711
00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.960
Pay for it!

712
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.080
We're safe.

713
00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.920
Those shopkeepers should join the Olympics
if they can run that fast.

714
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.560
I'm dizzy.

715
00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:18.760
Wait.

716
00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.480
I'll show you later.

717
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.000
What were you trying to do?

718
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.200
See how strong his windows are?

719
00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.920
No.

720
00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:31.400
What was it about?

721
00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:36.320
I was testing if you could
protect us from everything.

722
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.640
And the result?

723
00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.920
You're a good runner.

724
00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.400
Mom?

725
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.200
Okay. son.
We're not going to be friends with Fırat.

726
00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.120
I wasn't going to say that.

727
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.280
Are you sleeping?

728
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.000
No.

729
00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.560
Do you think Fırat is good?

730
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
What do you think?

731
00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.400
I don't know. Maybe.

732
00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.080
He won't be my father. right?

733
00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:35.400
You're just friends?
Like me and Fırat the dog?

734
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.200
We're just friends.

735
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.520
Like you and Fırat the dog.

736
00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.560
But he'll pay if he breaks your heart.

737
00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.880
Okay. don't cry.

738
00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.280
I don't want you to cry.

739
00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.840
No. I'm not crying.

740
00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.040
I just saw an onion in my dream.

741
00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.240
Fırat the dog smells kind of bad.

742
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.800
Does Fırat smell the same?

743
00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.200
I guess it's the boss's area of interest.

744
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.040
-Toilet paper?
-Yeah.

745
00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:46.840
True.

746
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.960
Does it have a meaning?

747
00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.040
Sorry.

748
00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:04.720
Can's dad left the house one night
to buy toilet paper.

749
00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.000
And he never came back.

750
00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:13.760
He died.

751
00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.240
So he's scared that one day
we'll run out of toilet paper.

752
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:28.160
I'll have to go buy some.
and something will happen to me.

753
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.680
That's what it means.

754
00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:49.120
-Fırat.
-Can.

755
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.480
What happens when you die?

756
00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.680
I don't know. I've never died.

757
00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.720
And why do we die?

758
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.080
I guess
because it's the end of our adventure.

759
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.120
What do you mean?

760
00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.560
Think of it like a movie with no action.

761
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.240
Would you keep watching it?

762
00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:16.320
No. it'd be too boring.

763
00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.040
Exactly.

764
00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.800
-Fırat.
-Boss?

765
00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.480
Thanks.

766
00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:28.000
For what?

767
00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.040
For being our friend.

768
01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.720
I need to tell you something.

769
01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.320
Later.

770
01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.440
So impatient!

771
01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.680
-Thanks.
-Enjoy it.

772
01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.360
Here you go. Go to Sister Fatoş.

773
01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.560
What do…

774
01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.040
What flavor?

775
01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.400
Dad?

776
01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.360
Dad?

777
01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:51.960
Is he okay?

778
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.800
Can!

779
01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.400
What are you doing? Can!

780
01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.840
-Are you okay?
-Dad!

781
01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.320
-Dad!
-Stop.

782
01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.760
Let me go to my dad!

783
01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.040
-Take him away.
-Can!

784
01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.720
-Can. come here.
-Dad!

785
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.000
-Let me go!
-Calm down!

786
01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.240
Let me go to my dad!

787
01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.800
-Can!
-Dad!

788
01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.280
-Dad!
-Can.

789
01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.440
-Can.
-Dad!

790
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.040
-We need to go.
-Let me go!

791
01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.160
-Dad!
-Can.

792
01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.120
-Let me go to him.
-Calm down.

793
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.160
Melisa?

794
01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.000
-That's my dad!
-Is that your kid?

795
01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.000
-Dad!
-Can.

796
01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:21.920
Dad!

797
01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.360
Dad!

798
01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.920
-Can.
-Dad!

799
01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.000
Melisa?

800
01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.040
What's going on?

801
01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.640
Call an ambulance.

802
01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.520
-Someone call an ambulance.
-Quick!

803
01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.080
I'm calling one.

804
01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.920
Why did you get up?

805
01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.680
Where is Can? Is he okay?

806
01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.080
He's at my place with Birce.

807
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.880
He cried for his dad all night.

808
01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.560
What did you say when he asked about me?

809
01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.840
I said you were a little sick.

810
01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.920
Fuck.

811
01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.880
He waited all night.

812
01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.440
What happened last night?

813
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.280
You owe Can an explanation.

814
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.640
What kind of mom
puts her son through that?

815
01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.040
A cowardly…

816
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.760
weak…

817
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.480
bad mom.

818
01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.080
Pick the one you want.

819
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:09.520
Why would you make someone fall in love
with you if you're about to die?

820
01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.320
Why?

821
01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.600
Why did you pick me for this torture?

822
01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.440
Please tell me this is not why we met.

823
01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.920
Someone had to care for Can. right?

824
01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.680
I guess I was a good candidate.

825
01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:45.240
Your smile was so beautiful
that I thought it was genuine and honest.

826
01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.680
It was genuine.

827
01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.920
Do you know when I was touched?

828
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.480
-When you did that toy trick.
-Don't.

829
01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:01.240
When you lost Can's toy. you jumped
into ice-cold water without hesitating.

830
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.440
Don't.

831
01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.560
I thought. "What a woman."

832
01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.560
"That's what a mom does."

833
01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.600
Don't.

834
01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.000
Your trick worked.

835
01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:20.640
Don't.

836
01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.360
-Birce. let's go to that room.
-For what?

837
01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.240
Come on. dude.

838
01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.960
The kid cried all day.

839
01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.280
Okay. come on.

840
01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.880
Where is my dad?

841
01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.440
Tell me!

842
01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.960
Where did he go?

843
01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.520
Why didn't he recognize me?

844
01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.920
Wasn't he dead?

845
01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.440
Can.

846
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.760
That's not your dad.

847
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.040
He is. You're lying.

848
01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.080
I thought you wouldn't lie to me.

849
01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.200
You're a liar!

850
01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.560
I wish you died!

851
01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.360
You're sick anyway!

852
01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.800
Are you sick?

853
01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:04.840
You're okay. right?

854
01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.160
You're fine.

855
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.840
Did I do something?

856
01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.480
Did I upset you?

857
01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:19.840
I'm sorry.

858
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.640
Let's go home. please.

859
01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.800
I'll never ask about Dad again. promise.

860
01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.800
Please.

861
01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.040
You will. Can.

862
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.640
You will.

863
01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.040
I'll be back soon.

864
01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.440
Where are you going?

865
01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.160
-Mom. don't go!
-Can.

866
01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.560
-I'll come back.
-Don't go!

867
01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.920
-Mom! Don't go. Mom!
-Can. honey…

868
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.440
-I'll come back. Don't cry.
-Don't go. Mom!

869
01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:56.200
-I'll be right back.
-Your mom will come back. Can.

870
01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.240
-Dear. she'll be back.
-Don't go!

871
01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.640
Yes?

872
01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.160
Fırat.

873
01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.680
We need to talk.

874
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.040
What's so urgent?

875
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.680
Will you dance with me?

876
01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.280
Did you call me for that?

877
01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.040
Consider it my last wish.

878
01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.680
Will you?

879
01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.120
I have a story
if you're willing to listen.

880
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.840
It's the story of a student

881
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.600
with small dreams.
who just wants to paint.

882
01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.880
She goes to the same bar
with her friends every night.

883
01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.720
There is a guy at the bar.

884
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.520
He's always there too.

885
01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.360
<i>She is in love with him.</i>

886
01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.920
He doesn't know.

887
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.680
It's unrequited.

888
01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.120
They haven't spoken at all.

889
01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.080
But she thinks she knows him
better than everyone else.

890
01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.080
She loves him better.

891
01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.520
She understands him better.

892
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:05.160
She is so sure that he'd like her back
if he just saw her.

893
01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.240
<i>Despite everything</i>

894
01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:11.040
<i>I regret nothing</i>

895
01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:14.360
<i>Despite everything</i>

896
01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.360
<i>I regret nothing</i>

897
01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.560
I told you. she is stupid.

898
01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.480
She's melodramatic. What can she do?

899
01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.200
One day. she musters up the courage.

900
01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.680
She goes up to the guy.

901
01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.160
She doesn't know
her life is about to change.

902
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.680
She says hi for the first time.

903
01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.560
-Awesome!
-It was awesome! Bravo!

904
01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.640
I'm fucked. Koray.
I've promised everyone tequila shots.

905
01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.720
You need to make it happen.

906
01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.760
Hello.

907
01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.600
Hello.

908
01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.640
Will you dance with me?

909
01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.640
For sure.

910
01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.360
To this song?

911
01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.320
Sure.

912
01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.480
Then comes the first touch.

913
01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.200
The first dance.

914
01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.240
Is your place nearby?

915
01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.160
Wait a minute. stop.

916
01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.520
Just a minute.

917
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.560
Do you want some coffee?

918
01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.400
What coffee?

919
01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:57.960
Coffee?

920
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.360
I'll buy us some stuff for breakfast.

921
01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.400
There is no more toilet paper either.

922
01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.000
Open the door for me. will you?

923
01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.000
Sure. but…

924
01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:45.080
Sure. but I think you can leave.
It's morning anyway.

925
01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.640
I'll come back.

926
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.480
I'm taking it. We'll finish it together.

927
01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.520
Okay?

928
01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.880
Even an idiot wouldn't believe
you were going to come back.

929
01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.520
But I did.

930
01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.400
I did.

931
01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.640
I was far along
when I found out about Can.

932
01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.440
There was no turning back.

933
01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.320
But I'm glad about it.

934
01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.680
So glad.

935
01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:26.400
It was the smartest stupidity of my life.

936
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.880
I had my dear baby.

937
01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.880
I came to your workplace
a few times to tell you.

938
01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.640
But you were never there.

939
01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.200
That's what they said.

940
01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.760
"Mr. Fırat is not here."

941
01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:54.440
Then I thought.
"Girl. you don't need anyone else."

942
01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.920
I didn't need you.
I didn't need other people.

943
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
I didn't need my dad who told me
to fuck off for getting pregnant.

944
01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.640
I didn't need anybody.

945
01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.240
He kept asking about his dad.

946
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.920
So I said my friend
who moved to Germany was his dad.

947
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.160
As you saw. that blew up in my face.

948
01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:23.200
You can live without facing your past.
but you can't die.

949
01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.360
I…

950
01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.160
I wasn't going to look for you. actually.

951
01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.240
But you came to me.

952
01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:45.040
There are thousands of cafés in Istanbul.
I turn around. and you're there.

953
01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:47.480
I turn my head and you're on the magazine.

954
01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.920
I said. "I guess I need to go to him."

955
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.320
"I need to go back
to where it all started."

956
01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.560
But I never lied to you.

957
01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:03.760
My smiles weren't a lie.
Nothing was a lie.

958
01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.720
No.

959
01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.200
I wanted you to love me.

960
01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.440
I wanted to be with you.

961
01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.080
I wanted you to love Can.

962
01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.120
Not by force.

963
01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.080
I wanted you to truly love us.

964
01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.240
I wonder…

965
01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:35.600
if that night…

966
01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:39.040
I'm sure you forgot about me.

967
01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.120
But I wonder if you feel me in there.
deep inside?

968
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.520
Maybe?

969
01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.320
Fırat?

970
01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:01.480
Say something.

971
01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.760
Anything.

972
01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:33.320
It's late. Maybe you should fuck off.

973
01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.200
Munu Munu.

974
01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.360
These are…

975
01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.720
his favorites.

976
01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:41.040
And this is for any question
you might have.

977
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.320
<i>"Can for Beginners."</i>

978
01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:00.720
Melisa.

979
01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:04.240
This is not a goodbye. No.

980
01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.280
No. it's not.

981
01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.520
I'm going to come back.

982
01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.520
I just want Can to stay here for a bit.

983
01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.640
He needs to get used to it.

984
01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.000
He needs to get used to it.

985
01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:33.720
It's Fırat. right?

986
01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.040
It was my idea.

987
01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.400
It was my idea. I'm sorry.

988
01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.080
Don't be silly.

989
01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.800
Melisa. you know I grew up without a dad.

990
01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:55.200
I didn't want Can to grow up like that.

991
01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.520
Because it was shitty.

992
01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.280
We won't cry
like a bunch of losers. right?

993
01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:07.520
We won't.

994
01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.120
I love you so much.

995
01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.720
Okay. boomer.

996
01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.520
I love you so much too.

997
01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.560
-See you.
-See you.

998
01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:21.760
Hello.

999
01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.160
Hello.

1000
01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:27.040
Is Can here?

1001
01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:31.600
He's staying with us.

1002
01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.480
Let's go together if you want.

1003
01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.080
Let's go.

1004
01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.200
I'm glad you came.

1005
01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.400
He kept saying. "I miss Fırat so much."

1006
01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.520
But I didn't know which Fırat he meant.

1007
01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.240
Were you beaten up?

1008
01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.480
Are you mad at us?

1009
01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:17.960
Not at all.

1010
01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.080
I was just busy for a few days.

1011
01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.000
Is that why
you don't call me boss anymore?

1012
01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:44.480
Okay. relax.

1013
01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:50.400
Boss.

1014
01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.880
<i>Come on. boss. Let's wake your mom up.</i>

1015
01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:10.480
Take it.

1016
01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.960
Fırat. should I put these?

1017
01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.160
Bring the olives.

1018
01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:25.160
Good job. Sit down.

1019
01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.120
Okay.

1020
01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.800
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1021
01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.080
Good morning.

1022
01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.440
We made you breakfast. Mommy.

1023
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.160
Come here.

1024
01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:08.640
Good boy.

1025
01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:57.960
I'm here.

1026
01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:01.520
I'll always be here.

1027
01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:15.760
We never got the timing right.

1028
01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:41.400
I love you so much.

1029
01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:46.040
I love you so much.

1030
01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:46.760
Mom.

1031
01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:50.360
You won't hurt. will you?

1032
01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:00.960
Just go to sleep now.

1033
01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.320
Put me to sleep.

1034
01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.040
First Word.

1035
01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:10.120
Cold.

1036
01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.600
Hot.

1037
01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.440
Dark.

1038
01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:18.880
Sun.

1039
01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:21.120
Death.

1040
01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.440
Life.

1041
01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:28.520
Mom.

1042
01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.160
Mom!

1043
01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.760
Mom.

1044
01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:31.760
Fırat?

1045
01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:24.400
Did she have to leave?

1046
01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:29.200
Boss. one day. all of us…

1047
01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.800
No. don't tell me that anymore.

1048
01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:34.000
Tell me something else. I'm sick of it.

1049
01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:42.200
I'm hurting so bad.

1050
01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:46.560
But I don't know the words to describe it.
I'm too little.

1051
01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:49.800
Believe me. I don't either.

1052
01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:51.360
And I'm not very little.

1053
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.560
Will it be okay?

1054
01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.320
No. boss.

1055
01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.280
But maybe this can help
whenever you wish she were here.

1056
01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.240
-What's this?
-Open it up.

1057
01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.040
Look. it's me!

1058
01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.280
See. that's you!

1059
01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:28.440
And your bike.

1060
01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:34.200
Fırat the dog.

1061
01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:36.920
Is this Şirin?

1062
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.160
Your girl.

1063
01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.880
No. she isn't!

1064
01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:45.000
Are we going to be housemates now?

1065
01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:48.760
-Do you want that?
-Okay. but I have rules.

1066
01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:50.240
What rules?

1067
01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:53.240
One. I don't watch movies with no action.

1068
01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.280
-And?
-Two. I need back scratches to sleep.

1069
01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:00.840
-What else?
-Three. I don't pay rent.

1070
01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:04.480
Four. we need to talk about school.
I'm not sure about it.

1071
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.240
Boss. do you have a user manual
for all these rules?

1072
01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.320
Fatoş has something like that.

1073
01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:13.240
<i>Can for Beginners.</i>

1074
01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:14.760
Be sure to read it.

1075
01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:16.200
It tells you all about me.

1076
