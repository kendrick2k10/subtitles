383
00:12:24.333 --> 00:12:26.533
couldn't read.

384
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.433
And then he was. like. "Okay.

385
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.600
it's all right. you can stop

386
00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:31.767
right there." and...

387
00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:32.800
Pulled me to the side later.

388
00:12:32.867 --> 00:12:34.567
he was. like. "Um. how

389
00:12:34.633 --> 00:12:35.600
old are you?"

390
00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:36.600
I was. like. "I'm. like. I'm

391
00:12:36.667 --> 00:12:37.600
19."

392
00:12:37.667 --> 00:12:38.600
He's. like. "You really should

393
00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:39.500
work on that. learning how to

394
00:12:39.567 --> 00:12:41.033
read."

395
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.934
And I was. like. "Yeah. I know."

396
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.166
He's. like. "If you want. I

397
00:12:45.233 --> 00:12:46.734
could help you sometimes."

398
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.200
And I said. "Okay. cool."

399
00:12:48.266 --> 00:12:48.667
(shutter clicks)

400
00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:52.800
I done introduced Naz to Naudy.

401
00:12:52.867 --> 00:12:54.166
I done introduced Naz to my

402
00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:56.900
brother.

403
00:12:56.967 --> 00:12:59.333
Pat knew Sunny.

404
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.333
Sunny brought Levi.

405
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.400
>> Eventually. they did become

406
00:13:04.467 --> 00:13:06.033
my followers. they joined the

407
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.200
temple. and they agreed to give

408
00:13:08.266 --> 00:13:09.633
me the. um. the head position

409
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.734
as the. uh. the high priest of

410
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.867
the temple.

411
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.567
The actual temple was right

412
00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:20.033
across the street from a

413
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.433
projects that they call the Pork

414
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.467
and Beans projects.

415
00:13:24.767 --> 00:13:26.300
There's a lot of gun selling.

416
00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:27.734
drug dealing. and a lot of

417
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.767
violence that goes on.

418
00:13:29.834 --> 00:13:33.533
And. um. drive-by shootings.

419
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.734
>> So we rent the warehouse.

420
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.867
But it was supposed to be a

421
00:13:36.934 --> 00:13:38.133
temple.

422
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.767
A temple.

423
00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:43.233
We had Bibles. we had Quran.

424
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.400
we had certain books. the Hare

425
00:13:44.467 --> 00:13:45.367
Krishna. we had certain books.

426
00:13:45.433 --> 00:13:46.367
'cause...

427
00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:47.367
It was. everybody was welcome

428
00:13:47.433 --> 00:13:48.200
to our table-- that was the

429
00:13:48.266 --> 00:13:49.100
whole one thing about why we

430
00:13:49.166 --> 00:13:50.033
called it the temple.

431
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.867
Because what's in a temple. is

432
00:13:50.934 --> 00:13:51.834
where you actually get in your

433
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:52.867
temple and pray.

434
00:13:52.934 --> 00:13:54.800
>> We wasn't Muslims.

435
00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:55.867
But we had to understand the

436
00:13:55.934 --> 00:13:57.934
religions of the world and how

437
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.767
they related to the people that

438
00:13:59.834 --> 00:14:01.033
we going to talk to.

439
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.033
So. 99%. we studied the Bible.

440
00:14:06.367 --> 00:14:07.934
>> The temple was called Moorish

441
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.734
Science Temple of America and

442
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.400
Universal Divine Saviors.

443
00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:14.533
>> It sounded cool.

444
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.934
Naz said. "The whole reason I

445
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.834
came to Miami was to make all

446
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.233
of you guys Moorish. Moorish

447
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.567
Americans."

448
00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:23.100
I'm. like. "Moorish Americans?"

449
00:14:23.834 --> 00:14:25.433
>> You may not have heard of the

450
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.667
Moorish Nationals.

451
00:14:26.734 --> 00:14:28.133
It comes from a Black religious

452
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.233
group that's been around for

453
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.500
nearly a century.

454
00:14:30.567 --> 00:14:32.500
Most of its members obey the

455
00:14:32.567 --> 00:14:33.734
law. but not everyone.

456
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.800
>> This man was arrested by

457
00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:36.367
police in Fayetteville. North

458
00:14:36.433 --> 00:14:37.533
Carolina.

459
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.800
But his wife claims the arrest

460
00:14:38.867 --> 00:14:40.400
was illegal because he is a

461
00:14:40.467 --> 00:14:42.667
member of the Moorish Nation.

462
00:14:42.734 --> 00:14:44.100
>> He has diplomatic immunity.

463
00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:45.133
Why are y'all doing this?

464
00:14:45.767 --> 00:14:46.867
>> He was telling me. um. the

465
00:14:46.934 --> 00:14:48.700
Moorish Science Temple is.

466
00:14:48.767 --> 00:14:50.667
like. indigenous people to

467
00:14:50.734 --> 00:14:52.767
America and we have sovereign

468
00:14:52.834 --> 00:14:54.133
rights.

469
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.300
And I didn't understand what

470
00:14:55.367 --> 00:14:56.900
none of that (bleep) was.

471
00:14:56.967 --> 00:14:58.533
I was. like. "What the (bleep)

472
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.367
is sovereign rights?"

473
00:15:02.433 --> 00:15:05.700
>> What snatch you up is when

474
00:15:05.767 --> 00:15:07.367
they tell you you didn't

475
00:15:07.433 --> 00:15:09.100
come over here just on no slave

476
00:15:09.166 --> 00:15:10.934
ship.

477
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.767
And the Moorish Science Temple.

478
00:15:12.834 --> 00:15:16.000
it mixed Christianity. Judaism.

479
00:15:16.066 --> 00:15:19.667
and Islamism all in one.

480
00:15:19.734 --> 00:15:21.867
They are geared to help the

481
00:15:21.934 --> 00:15:23.433
Black community.

482
00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:32.066
>> So we sitting down just

483
00:15:32.133 --> 00:15:33.200
building on the Bible and

484
00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.600
talking about making a great

485
00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.367
change. you know. and can we

486
00:15:36.433 --> 00:15:38.066
do it. can we actually. you

487
00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:40.000
know. change not just our

488
00:15:40.066 --> 00:15:41.266
condition. but the condition of

489
00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:42.266
our moms and dads and cousins

490
00:15:42.333 --> 00:15:43.400
and community?

491
00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:52.200
>> You know. you can't come into

492
00:15:52.266 --> 00:15:53.367
the community if you ain't no

493
00:15:53.433 --> 00:15:54.867
strong man.

494
00:15:54.934 --> 00:15:57.066
So. we came across. like. "Yo.

495
00:15:57.133 --> 00:15:58.934
we are soldiers."

496
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
You know. "We soldiers for God."

497

♪ ♪

498
00:16:23.467 --> 00:16:24.333
>> They had uniforms that they

499
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.467
would wear. paramilitary

500

uniforms.

501
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.500
Khaki-type shirt and they would

502
00:16:29.567 --> 00:16:31.066
wear the same type of pants.

503
00:16:31.133 --> 00:16:32.934
This is the Moorish star. you

504
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.266
know. for the religion.

505
00:16:34.333 --> 00:16:35.533
And then of course. them living

American flag.

508
00:16:38.033 --> 00:16:39.367
And what was so ironic about

509
00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:40.633
this whole thing is that the

510
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.934
government tried to paint them

511
00:16:42.033 --> 00:16:43.934
as that they were un-American.

512
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.767
>> You know. we brought in

513
00:16:46.834 --> 00:16:48.500
experts to tell us. "Hey.

what...

515
00:16:50.066 --> 00:16:51.000
Which. uh. what flavor of

516
00:16:51.066 --> 00:16:51.934
Kool-Aid is this. 'cause we

517
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.834
haven't seen this before?"

518
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.433
Something is not making sense.

519
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.734
You had a group of guys that

520
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.600
were in Liberty City that

521
00:17:02.667 --> 00:17:04.200
wanted to meet somebody from

522
00:17:04.266 --> 00:17:05.467
Al-Qaeda.

523
00:17:05.533 --> 00:17:06.967
Everything had to be followed

524
00:17:07.033 --> 00:17:08.166
up.

525
00:17:08.233 --> 00:17:10.300
Because some of the things that

526
00:17:10.367 --> 00:17:12.500
fell through the gap that

527
00:17:12.567 --> 00:17:14.567
allowed 9/11 to happen. we

528
00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:17.200
could not allow for anything

529
00:17:17.266 --> 00:17:18.600
like that to fall through a gap

530
00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:20.700
again.

531
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.934
I had never heard of the

532
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.133
informant. Abbas Al-Saidi.

533
00:17:32.233 --> 00:17:33.367
Abbas had worked at a

534
00:17:33.433 --> 00:17:35.533
convenience store. you know.

535
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.233
in a medium- to low-income

536
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.100
neighborhood.

537
00:17:41.166 --> 00:17:42.133
>> He started out as a snitch

538
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.333
initially for drugs.

539
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.133
New York City has its own

540
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.433
intelligence unit. which was

541
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.100
focused on terrorism after 9/11.

542
00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:54.467
They found this young guy from

543
00:17:54.533 --> 00:17:56.767
Yemen who's pretty street-smart

544
00:17:56.834 --> 00:17:59.166
to be somebody that they could

545
00:17:59.233 --> 00:18:01.266
use in their investigation in

546
00:18:01.333 --> 00:18:03.333
New York.

547
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.600
At some point in time. there

548
00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:06.033
became a threat that they

549
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.500
considered to be a threat

550
00:18:07.567 --> 00:18:08.767
against him.

551
00:18:08.834 --> 00:18:09.834
They encouraged him to move out

552
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.200
of New York City.

553
00:18:11.266 --> 00:18:12.767
And. and ultimately. he. he

554
00:18:12.834 --> 00:18:15.000
moved down to Miami.

555
00:18:15.066 --> 00:18:16.433
>> I was 18 years old at this

556
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.400
time. going on 19.

557
00:18:18.467 --> 00:18:21.200
I just kind of was in love

558
00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:23.467
with him and did what he... told

559
00:18:23.533 --> 00:18:24.734
me to do.

560
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.900
And I trusted him.

561
00:18:25.967 --> 00:18:27.233
And that was one of my biggest

562
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.433
mistakes.

563
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.033
We had three dollars between

564
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.266
the both of us and we got into

565
00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:35.467
a really physical argument.

566
00:18:35.533 --> 00:18:37.200
>> He beats the crap out of

567
00:18:37.266 --> 00:18:38.600

568
00:18:38.667 --> 00:18:40.467
Uh. ends up in jail.

569

Even though it was his first

572
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.133
domestic violence. he went to

573
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.300
jail for a couple of months.

574
00:18:50.367 --> 00:18:51.734
He kept calling the connections

575
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.900
that he had in New York.

576
00:18:52.967 --> 00:18:53.867
>> He reaches out to the

577
00:18:53.934 --> 00:18:55.700
lieutenant in New York. "Hey.

578
00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:56.900
can you help me out. I'm in

579
00:18:56.967 --> 00:18:57.834
jail." yadda yadda. tells him

580
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.000
the story.

581
00:18:59.066 --> 00:19:00.166
The guy says. "Look. I can

582
00:19:00.233 --> 00:19:01.233
maybe. you know. reach out to

583
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.734
the FBI and see if they might

584
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.967
have an interest." and an

585
00:19:04.033 --> 00:19:05.133
agent comes and visits him in

586
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.633
jail.

587
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.133
>> He told me that when he came

588
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.667
out of jail. that the FBI was

589
00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:12.900
waiting there to go to work.

590
00:19:12.967 --> 00:19:14.834
He found the brothers and that's

591
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.633
all he needed to do the job.

592
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.000
>> I used to go to the corner

593
00:19:20.066 --> 00:19:21.333
store and see him all the time.

594
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.734
And he was extra-friendly.

595
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.633
He would try to act Black so

596
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.633
much.

597
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.700
Smoking weed in the (bleep)

598
00:19:26.767 --> 00:19:28.967
store. blasting Tupac.

599
00:19:29.033 --> 00:19:30.867
And I'm. like. damn.

600
00:19:30.934 --> 00:19:33.233
I was. like. this dude is wild.

601
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.000
He was. like. "What's up?"

602
00:19:35.066 --> 00:19:36.333
I was. like. "Man. what's up?"

603
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.133
I used to go over to the store

604
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.367
all the time buying 'gars and

605
00:19:38.433 --> 00:19:39.633
(bleep) to smoke.

606
00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.934
>> The weed that he had. the

607
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.567
marijuana he had. was great

608
00:19:42.633 --> 00:19:44.600
substance and it was the kind of

609
00:19:44.667 --> 00:19:45.667
substance that I really enjoyed.

610
00:19:45.734 --> 00:19:47.500
so my friend that worked there

611
00:19:47.567 --> 00:19:48.734
would get it for me.

612
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.333
>> One day he see me with Naz.

613
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.033
he. like. "Oh. you know the

614
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.200
brother!"

615
00:19:53.266 --> 00:19:54.266
And he switched it up. now he's.

616
00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:55.900
like. all Muslim and he's. like.

617
00:19:55.967 --> 00:19:57.700
"Yes. brother"-- he's not even

618
00:19:57.767 --> 00:19:59.133
using it. he's not smoking. he's

619
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.100
not using the N word. he's not

620
00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:02.967
cussing. he's all Muslim now.

621
00:20:03.033 --> 00:20:04.400
(laughs): He's a Muslim now.

622
00:20:04.467 --> 00:20:05.767
I'm. like. "What happened?"

623
00:20:05.834 --> 00:20:06.834
>> He seemed very religious but

624
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.233
he seemed very street.

625
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.533
Like. street hustler.

626
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.633
So. that's why I related to him

627
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.166
in a sense. because he had

628
00:20:14.233 --> 00:20:16.633
game. he had a street vibe.

629
00:20:21.867 --> 00:20:23.834
>> One day. his cousin comes

630
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.000
down. he. like. "Man. y'all

631
00:20:26.066 --> 00:20:27.500
don't wanna mess with Abbas.

632
00:20:27.567 --> 00:20:29.867
man." and then. we couldn't get

633
00:20:29.934 --> 00:20:31.200
it. 'cause we ain't thinking

634
00:20:31.266 --> 00:20:33.533
about no FBI. no police. or...

635
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.533
He. like. "Man. y'all don't

636
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.467
wanna mess with him. man. he

637
00:20:35.533 --> 00:20:36.900
dirty."

638
00:20:37.266 --> 00:20:39.633
>> I remember him saying. "Abbas

639
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.100
is working with the police."

640
00:20:41.166 --> 00:20:43.633
Now. I was. like. "What?"

641
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:44.967
>> He said Abbas was involved

642
00:20:45.033 --> 00:20:46.500
in setting people up with law

643
00:20:46.567 --> 00:20:47.967
enforcement.

644
00:20:48.033 --> 00:20:49.433
And that if he ever gets a

645
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.166
chance to. he'll fabricate a

646
00:20:51.233 --> 00:20:53.367
story on me.

647
00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.633
>> That's where we met him.

648
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.200
>> The government said that

649
00:21:04.266 --> 00:21:06.200
when I met Abbas. I went into

650
00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.433
his store asking him. "Can you

651
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.500
hook me up with Osama bin

652
00:21:09.567 --> 00:21:12.000
Laden or any terrorist guy?"

653
00:21:12.066 --> 00:21:13.433
That's what they were saying.

654
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.433
And...

655
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.433
>> Is that true?

656
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.200
>> No. it never happened.

657
00:21:18.266 --> 00:21:20.767
>> What the informant initially

658
00:21:20.834 --> 00:21:23.433
said: "I met a guy who has a

659
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.867
group.

660
00:21:24.934 --> 00:21:26.333
They wanna overthrow the United

661
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.600
States. they wanna meet an

662
00:21:27.667 --> 00:21:29.467
Al-Qaeda operative. and they

663
00:21:29.533 --> 00:21:30.767
wanna align themselves with

664
00:21:30.834 --> 00:21:32.800
Al-Qaeda."

665
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.100
One of the critical capabilities

666
00:21:36.166 --> 00:21:37.900
that a terrorist organization

667
00:21:37.967 --> 00:21:39.633
such as Al-Qaeda needs is

668
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.367
resources here in the States.

669
00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:43.300
If they could acquire the

670
00:21:43.367 --> 00:21:46.600
capability of a U.S. citizen or

671
00:21:46.667 --> 00:21:48.433
a group of U.S. citizens that

672
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.900
are completely off the radar.

673
00:21:49.967 --> 00:21:51.667
well. that's. that's a pretty

674
00:21:51.734 --> 00:21:54.100
formidable threat.

675
00:21:56.133 --> 00:21:57.767
So. at the time. I'm thinking

676
00:21:57.834 --> 00:21:59.066
maybe something was

677
00:21:59.133 --> 00:22:02.934
miscommunicated. misunderstood.

678
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.266
You know. one of the ways we

679
00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:07.133
resolve that is reconstitute the

680
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.834
conversation and capture it on

681
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.433
audio.

682
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.266
(tape recorder starts)

683
00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:13.000
>> This is Special Agent John P.

684
00:22:13.066 --> 00:22:14.166
Stewart with the Federal Bureau

685
00:22:14.233 --> 00:22:15.433
of Investigation. Miami

686
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.633
Division.

687
00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.633
Today's date. October 3. 2005.

688
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.300
The time. 2:45 p.m.

689
00:22:24.367 --> 00:22:25.200
(phone calling out)

690
00:22:25.266 --> 00:22:29.433
(tape recorder stops)

691
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.066
>> Hm.

692
00:22:31.133 --> 00:22:32.867
It was just one of the worst.

693
00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:34.700
I guess you could say. things

694
00:22:34.767 --> 00:22:36.600
that could have ever happened

695
00:22:36.667 --> 00:22:38.800
to us in our life.

696
00:22:38.867 --> 00:22:39.934
Because this cry from this

697
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.500
man for Narseal to help him

698
00:22:42.567 --> 00:22:45.567
turned out actually to be

699
00:22:45.633 --> 00:22:49.400
what actually set

700
00:22:49.467 --> 00:22:52.266
everything for us in turmoil.

701
00:22:54.133 --> 00:22:55.433
>> The turning point between me

702
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.567
and Abbas is when I went to the

703
00:22:56.633 --> 00:22:58.734
store. I seen ICE there.

704
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.200
Immigration Custom Enforcement.

705
00:23:01.266 --> 00:23:03.000
Abbas was rampaging back and

706
00:23:03.066 --> 00:23:04.900
forth in the store. "Brother.

707
00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:05.934
um. I'm in a lot of trouble

708
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.800
right now. they. they're

709
00:23:06.867 --> 00:23:08.066
trying to deport me."

710
00:23:08.133 --> 00:23:09.567
>> Of course. being the man that

711
00:23:09.633 --> 00:23:11.400
Narseal is. he would want to

712
00:23:11.467 --> 00:23:15.400
help at any given opportunity.

713
00:23:15.467 --> 00:23:16.800
Narseal had told him. "If you

714
00:23:16.867 --> 00:23:19.333
need any help. reach out to us."

715
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.467
And of course. he did.

716
00:23:24.233 --> 00:23:25.667
(sighs): And then from there

717
00:23:25.734 --> 00:23:26.567
started the nightmare.

718
00:23:26.633 --> 00:23:27.567
(tape recorder starts)

719
00:23:27.633 --> 00:23:28.867
(phone calling out)

720
00:23:28.934 --> 00:23:30.000
>> How you doing. brother?

721
00:23:30.066 --> 00:23:31.033
Eid Mubarak.

722
00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.900
>> Just working like crazy.

723
00:23:32.967 --> 00:23:34.300
>> What time. what time exactly

724
00:23:34.367 --> 00:23:35.900
are you gonna be at the temple?

725
00:23:35.967 --> 00:23:37.300
>> Uh. I can't really say right

726
00:23:37.367 --> 00:23:38.300
now. 'cause I got so much work

727
00:23:38.367 --> 00:23:39.467
ahead of me today.

728
00:23:39.533 --> 00:23:41.533
(tape recorder stops)

729
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.734
The phone calls of him

730
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.533
calling me just. just increased.

731
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.700
Instead of being at. like. every

732
00:23:46.767 --> 00:23:48.100
two weeks. he'll call me. see

733
00:23:48.166 --> 00:23:49.200
how I'm doing. it was. like.

734
00:23:49.266 --> 00:23:50.667
every day.

735
00:23:50.734 --> 00:23:51.834
(tape recorder starts)

736
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.033
(phone calling out)

737
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.200
>> Um. I don't know. if you want

738
00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:55.500
me to come over or if you wanna

739
00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:56.800
come over. I'm. I'm. I'm free

740
00:23:56.867 --> 00:23:58.100
right now.

741
00:23:58.166 --> 00:23:59.400
>> They just called me on a job

742
00:23:59.467 --> 00:24:00.934
and I have to go look at a job

743
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.200
at the airport. so I'm gonna be

744
00:24:02.266 --> 00:24:04.233
leaving in about an hour.

745
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.367
He's saying he needs to meet me

746
00:24:05.433 --> 00:24:06.266
right away.

747
00:24:06.333 --> 00:24:07.266
(tape recorder stops)

748
00:24:07.333 --> 00:24:08.834
>> And what was your response?

749
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.734
>> Uh. as soon as I get a chance

750
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.800
to. 'cause I was very busy with

751
00:24:10.867 --> 00:24:11.700
work.

752
00:24:11.767 --> 00:24:13.166
With the construction company.

753
00:24:13.767 --> 00:24:24.934
(phone calling out)

754
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.867
(voicemail beeps softly)

755
00:24:25.934 --> 00:24:27.433
>> Azteca Stucco & Masonry.

756
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.934
I loved the name Azteca because

757
00:24:29.033 --> 00:24:30.834
of the Aztec. um...

758
00:24:31.533 --> 00:24:33.600
Ancient Indians were. uh.

759
00:24:33.667 --> 00:24:35.800
master builders. so I adopted

760
00:24:35.867 --> 00:24:36.800
that.

761
00:24:36.867 --> 00:24:38.934
(camera shutter clicking)

762
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.500
>> Pat was in the construction

763
00:24:40.567 --> 00:24:42.166
field.

764
00:24:42.233 --> 00:24:43.033
Sunny was in the construction

765
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.233
field.

766
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.834
Naz was a truck driver.

767
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.200
I was doing security and a

768
00:24:47.266 --> 00:24:49.000
little side hustle.

769
00:24:49.066 --> 00:24:51.233
And we needed to make money.

770
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.333
Pat was. like. "I have an idea."

771
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.800
>> We gonna team up and. you

772
00:24:56.867 --> 00:24:58.100
know. let's put a small

773
00:24:58.166 --> 00:25:01.000
construction company together.

774
00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:02.600
We got the skills. we got the

775
00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:03.867
determination. we got a

776
00:25:03.934 --> 00:25:05.667
willingness. and we got--

777
00:25:05.734 --> 00:25:06.367
there's the need.

778
00:25:06.433 --> 00:25:08.100
(shutter clicks)

779
00:25:08.166 --> 00:25:10.700
>> I'm coming home. dead tired.

780
00:25:10.767 --> 00:25:12.500
and man. I was happy.

781
00:25:12.567 --> 00:25:14.600
I was. like. "Man. I'm doing

782
00:25:14.667 --> 00:25:16.333
something. I'm doing something.

783
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.900
You know. change is coming."

784
00:25:17.967 --> 00:25:19.400
(shutter clicking)

785
00:25:19.467 --> 00:25:21.333
It was the first time in my life

786
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.967
I was working towards my own

787
00:25:23.033 --> 00:25:24.100
business.

788
00:25:24.166 --> 00:25:25.300
My own business.

789
00:25:25.367 --> 00:25:26.300
(shutter clicks)

790
00:25:26.367 --> 00:25:28.500
>> I dived all in. I had all

791
00:25:28.567 --> 00:25:29.734
my cards in the construction

792
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.767
game.

793
00:25:30.834 --> 00:25:32.667
Sacrificed weeks without even

794
00:25:32.734 --> 00:25:36.533
getting paid. wake up... early.

795
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.500
and go to sleep late.

796
00:25:37.567 --> 00:25:39.033
And there's no money on the

797
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.567
table-- I'm not getting paid.

798
00:25:41.633 --> 00:25:43.166
>> We had several instances

799
00:25:43.233 --> 00:25:44.667
where we were not getting paid.

800
00:25:44.734 --> 00:25:46.600
plus the investment we already

801
00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:48.200
had made into. uh. remodeling

802
00:25:48.266 --> 00:25:49.600
the temple.

803
00:25:49.667 --> 00:25:51.333
So we was at a financial...

804
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.700
Just rough.

805
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.100
>> The biggest mistake he was

806
00:26:06.166 --> 00:26:08.867
consistently making was using

807
00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:10.133
other job money to cover other

808
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.500
job because he underestimated

809
00:26:11.567 --> 00:26:12.734
this job.

810
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.934
The number-one rule in

811
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.266
construction: every job pay

812
00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:16.367
itself.

813
00:26:16.433 --> 00:26:18.500
You don't use money from another

814
00:26:18.567 --> 00:26:20.533
job to cover bills in another

815
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.600
job-- that's bad business.

816
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.066
>> I just knew it became very

817
00:26:34.133 --> 00:26:36.133
overwhelming for him.

818
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.533
Oftentimes he would just not

819
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.867
sleep.

820
00:26:39.934 --> 00:26:41.500
Everybody wanted a. a better

821
00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:43.567
way of living. so he felt the

822
00:26:43.633 --> 00:26:44.800
pressure of all these families

823
00:26:44.867 --> 00:26:46.066
on him.

824
00:26:46.133 --> 00:26:47.800
(shutter clicks)

825
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.166
>> Test.

826
00:26:53.233 --> 00:26:54.900
This is Balan. today's date is

827
00:26:54.967 --> 00:26:57.967
11-21-2005.

828
00:26:58.033 --> 00:27:02.467
Time is 1:38 p.m.

829
00:27:02.533 --> 00:27:06.033
This recording includes A.K.A.

830
00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.900
Brother Naz.

831
00:27:07.967 --> 00:27:10.767
(phone calling out)

832
00:27:10.834 --> 00:27:12.266
>> Hi.

833
00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:13.433
>> As-salaam alaykum.

834
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.467
>> Yeah?

835
00:27:14.533 --> 00:27:15.500
>> How you doing. akhi. what's

836
00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:16.600
going on?

837
00:27:16.667 --> 00:27:17.967
>> Hey. what's up. Ab?

838
00:27:18.033 --> 00:27:19.133
>> Alhamdulillah. alhamdulillah.

839
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.734
you okay. akhi?

840
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.900
>> Yeah. (inaudible). hanging in

841
00:27:21.967 --> 00:27:22.834
there.

842
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.867
>> I hear you. brother.

843
00:27:24.934 --> 00:27:26.066
>> I've been working. but I'm

844
00:27:26.133 --> 00:27:27.500
gonna get off early today.

845
00:27:27.567 --> 00:27:29.066
I'll probably be at the temple

846
00:27:29.133 --> 00:27:30.567
around 7:00.

847
00:27:30.633 --> 00:27:31.767
>> Okay. so you want me to meet

848
00:27:31.834 --> 00:27:33.433
you at the temple at 7:00. or do

849
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.433
you wanna come over to the.

850
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.266
to the. um. to the house?

851
00:27:37.333 --> 00:27:39.100
>> Uh...

852
00:27:39.166 --> 00:27:40.867
>> I mean. I'm in my house.

853
00:27:40.934 --> 00:27:42.767
It's. it's more safe. you know?

854
00:27:42.834 --> 00:27:45.266
Over here. it's. it's quiet.

855
00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:47.133
>> Okay. I'll. I'll be there

856
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.367
around 7:00. then.

857
00:27:48.433 --> 00:27:49.567
>> All right. brother. thank you

858
00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:51.133
very much. man.

859
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.934
(phone disconnects)

860
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.533
>> Abbas kept begging and

861
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.400
begging. begging. he just

862
00:27:55.467 --> 00:27:56.834
kept promising. "You just don't

863
00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:57.867
realize the opportunity that

864
00:27:57.934 --> 00:27:59.333
I can have for you."

865
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.300
You know. "We're gonna do

866
00:28:00.367 --> 00:28:01.133
something really. really. really

867
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.433
great.

868
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.533
Together. financially."

869
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.266
"I could really help you guys.

870
00:28:06.333 --> 00:28:07.567
if you just trust me just a

871
00:28:07.633 --> 00:28:08.467
little bit. just to come by and

872
00:28:08.533 --> 00:28:11.100
talk."

873
00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:13.033
>> So it wasn't. "Let's see how

874
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.400
we can build a mousetrap. put

875
00:28:14.467 --> 00:28:16.867
a big piece of cheese on there."

876
00:28:16.934 --> 00:28:18.033
Listen. I don't even know if

877
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.600
this is a mouse.

878
00:28:20.667 --> 00:28:22.333
And if it is a mouse. I don't

879
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.200
even know if this mouse wants

880
00:28:24.266 --> 00:28:25.667
any cheese.

881
00:28:25.734 --> 00:28:28.000
So...

882
00:28:28.066 --> 00:28:29.667
We looked at Batiste and said

883
00:28:29.734 --> 00:28:31.467
he doesn't look like. you know.

884
00:28:31.533 --> 00:28:32.700
I don't know. he's...

885
00:28:32.767 --> 00:28:34.000
He's saying these things that a

886
00:28:34.066 --> 00:28:35.433
mouse would say. but let's give

887
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.934
him another shot.

888
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.133
And then we had nowhere else

889
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.767
to go but to put the piece of

890
00:28:40.834 --> 00:28:42.934
cheese on the trap.

891
00:28:48.266 --> 00:28:50.100
When you're sending an informant

892
00:28:50.166 --> 00:28:53.166
into a meeting. you're not

893
00:28:53.233 --> 00:28:54.700
giving them a script.

894
00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:56.133
You're giving them an outline.

895
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.500
with a. with some objectives

896
00:28:57.567 --> 00:28:59.934
to achieve.

897
00:29:01.233 --> 00:29:03.367
Revisit this conversation.

898
00:29:03.433 --> 00:29:05.567
Let Batiste explain in his own

899
00:29:05.633 --> 00:29:08.900
words what it is that he was

900
00:29:08.967 --> 00:29:12.367
asking Abbas for assistance in.

901
00:29:12.433 --> 00:29:15.533
The outline for that was in the

902
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.633
form of Abbas telling Narseal

903
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.734
Batiste. "Remember you told me

904
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.333
you wanted to meet an Al-Qaeda

905
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.400
guy.

906
00:29:23.467 --> 00:29:25.734
Um. well. I. I got the guy."

907
00:29:27.767 --> 00:29:28.867
>> Abbas has a friend of his

908
00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:31.333
that he wants me to meet who's

909
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.266
a financial guy. a rich guy.

910
00:29:33.333 --> 00:29:34.433
this. that. and the other.

911
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:35.567
And that he would help back us

912
00:29:35.633 --> 00:29:36.967
at whatever we needed.

913
00:29:37.033 --> 00:29:38.333
But we need to follow his

914
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.333
direction in this.

915
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.300
>> Okay. so he wants us to make

916
00:29:41.367 --> 00:29:42.433
sure that we're really good

917
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.600
Muslims.

918
00:29:43.667 --> 00:29:44.767
He's. like. "Yeah. you gotta be

919
00:29:44.834 --> 00:29:46.800
really good. good Muslim men.

920
00:29:47.033 --> 00:29:49.100
And no Christianity. so. so go

921
00:29:49.166 --> 00:29:50.600
buy some Qurans."

922
00:29:50.667 --> 00:29:53.867
I'm. like. "Uh-huh."

923
00:29:53.934 --> 00:29:57.867
>> Abbas told Naz he has a uncle

924
00:29:57.934 --> 00:29:59.066
coming down who's a

925
00:29:59.133 --> 00:30:00.166
philanthropist.

926
00:30:00.233 --> 00:30:01.700
And he love people who's helping

927
00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:03.133
the community.

928
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.533
That's what Abbas must have

929
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.600
repeated a thousand times: "Man.

930
00:30:06.667 --> 00:30:07.800
my uncle like to help people

931
00:30:07.867 --> 00:30:08.934
who help people.

932
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.033
Don't worry about nothing.

933
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.066
He's-- that's what he do."

934
00:30:11.133 --> 00:30:12.400
>> "I'm gonna talk to my uncle.

935
00:30:12.467 --> 00:30:14.166
My uncle going to help you.

936
00:30:14.233 --> 00:30:15.367
You know. he gonna get some

937
00:30:15.433 --> 00:30:16.467
money and we all gonna. you

938
00:30:16.533 --> 00:30:17.467
know. we're all gonna make

939
00:30:17.533 --> 00:30:18.233
some money."

940
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.033
>> We wanted the money. we

941
00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.200
wanted the funds. 'cause we...

942
00:30:21.266 --> 00:30:22.700
We were (bleep) up bad.

943
00:30:22.767 --> 00:30:24.266
Nobody had the knowledge of how

944
00:30:24.333 --> 00:30:25.867
to run a business.

945
00:30:25.934 --> 00:30:27.533
So we was (bleep) up what we was

946
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.667
doing.

947
00:30:29.734 --> 00:30:32.100
>> This is Balan. the date is

948
00:30:32.166 --> 00:30:36.600
11-21-2005. the time is 7:58

949
00:30:36.667 --> 00:30:38.000
p.m.

950
00:30:38.066 --> 00:30:42.567
(phone calling out)

951
00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:43.934
>> Akhi!

952
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
>> Akhi. how you doing. man?

953
00:30:45.066 --> 00:30:46.967
That's Brother Naz. huh?

954
00:30:47.033 --> 00:30:48.500
>> Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

955
00:30:48.567 --> 00:30:49.867
>> I'm waiting for you. man.

956
00:30:49.934 --> 00:30:51.000
How you doing. what's going on?

957
00:30:51.066 --> 00:30:52.967
>> Rock on. brother. rock on!

958
00:30:53.033 --> 00:30:54.066
>> All right. all right. I just

959
00:30:54.133 --> 00:30:55.367
don't wanna be missing anything.

960
00:30:55.433 --> 00:30:56.467
because I'm praying alone and I

961
00:30:56.533 --> 00:30:57.633
don't like it. man. I'm waiting

962
00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.100
for you for isha.

963
00:30:59.166 --> 00:31:00.367
>> Oh. inshallah. we're gonna be

964
00:31:00.433 --> 00:31:01.767
there in two or three minutes.

965
00:31:01.834 --> 00:31:03.734
>> Okay. inshallah. akhi.

966
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.834
>> Inshallah. man. salaam

967
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.000
alaykum.

968
00:31:06.066 --> 00:31:07.367
>> Mashallah.

969
00:31:07.433 --> 00:31:10.333
(phone disconnects)

970
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.033
The time is 7:59 p.m.

971
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.867
This recording is ended.

972
00:31:16.066 --> 00:31:17.367
(tape recorder stops)

973
00:31:17.433 --> 00:31:22.934
(dog barking. crickets chirping)

974
00:31:28.567 --> 00:31:33.567
(knock at door)

975
00:31:33.633 --> 00:31:37.133
(indistinct chatter)

976
00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:44.133
>> When we get there. we're

977
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:44.934
still in our work clothes

978
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.900
'cause we just left a job.

979
00:31:46.967 --> 00:31:49.166
Me and Patrick Abraham.

980
00:31:49.233 --> 00:31:53.333
(indistinct chatter)

981
00:32:00.133 --> 00:32:01.166
We were just kind of. like.

982
00:32:01.233 --> 00:32:02.500
clowning around.

983
00:32:02.567 --> 00:32:04.934
(indistinct chatter)

984
00:32:05.667 --> 00:32:07.133
Just laughing and talking

985
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.834
about the situation that Abbas

986
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.367
was. was talking to us about.

987
00:32:20.033 --> 00:32:21.233
>> Our intention from the

988
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.066
beginning was to put this to

989
00:32:23.133 --> 00:32:24.500
bed.

990
00:32:24.567 --> 00:32:25.667
He wants to meet Al-Qaeda?

991
00:32:25.734 --> 00:32:27.033
Okay. tell him you got a guy.

992
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.333
see what he says.

993
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.600
The expected response would be.

994
00:32:29.667 --> 00:32:30.700
"Well. what are you. what are

995
00:32:30.767 --> 00:32:32.033
you. what are you talking about?

996
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.467
I. I never-- I don't

997
00:32:33.533 --> 00:32:35.200
remember ever saying that."

998
00:33:10.066 --> 00:33:11.900
>> He could have said. "Hey.

999
00:33:11.967 --> 00:33:14.367
listen. I. I was a little out

1000
00:33:14.433 --> 00:33:16.834
of my lane. I was off my meds.

1001
00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.133
and I don't know what you're

1002
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.333
talking about."

1003
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.033
And then we would have happily

1004
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.166
have closed that investigation.

1005
00:33:23.233 --> 00:33:24.900
because it wasn't like we were

1006
00:33:24.967 --> 00:33:26.500
looking for work.

1007
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.333
>> I thought Abbas was an avenue

1008
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.066
to relinquish my financial

1009
00:33:40.133 --> 00:33:41.400
difficulty.

1010
00:33:41.467 --> 00:33:43.467
If I can just get the money. I

1011
00:33:43.533 --> 00:33:45.333
can pay these immediate bills.

1012
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.934
That was the only thing that

1013
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.133
kept driving me: that if I get

1014
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.967
that one handful of money. then

1015
00:33:52.033 --> 00:33:53.467
it's over with.

1016
00:34:13.433 --> 00:34:17.834
I had no belief into. um.

1017
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.800
fighting any jihad. holy war.

1018
00:34:19.867 --> 00:34:21.567
or anything that's going on in

1019
00:34:21.633 --> 00:34:22.567
the Middle East.

1020
00:34:22.633 --> 00:34:23.433
And even though it was against

1021
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.700
my morals and values. I felt

1022
00:34:24.767 --> 00:34:25.934
like if I could go through it

1023
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.266
and just get the money. then all

1024
00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:30.133
of that would be washed away.

1025
00:34:46.834 --> 00:34:48.066
>> "Well. Tony. we got the

1026
00:34:48.133 --> 00:34:49.000
tape."

1027
00:34:49.066 --> 00:34:50.800
"Okay. so what are we doing?"

1028
00:34:50.867 --> 00:34:52.333
"Well. he asked him. 'Hey. you

1029
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.700
remember when you wanted to

1030
00:34:53.767 --> 00:34:54.734
meet the...?'. and he said.

1031
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.800
'Yeah.'"

1032
00:34:55.867 --> 00:34:56.633
"So what. what are we doing

1033
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.633
now?"

1034
00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.233
"Okay. well. you. you're gonna

1035
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.700
have to put somebody that's

1036
00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:04.033
gonna pretend to be Al-Qaeda

1037
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.333
in front of him."

1038
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.400
>> My name is Elie Assaad.

1039
00:35:07.467 --> 00:35:09.000
former undercover operative for

1040
00:35:09.066 --> 00:35:11.467
United State. uh. government.

1041
00:35:11.533 --> 00:35:13.834
>> We identified an informant

1042
00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.834
that had been previously used in

1043
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.700
another FBI investigation in

1044
00:35:17.767 --> 00:35:19.166
Miami.

1045
00:35:19.233 --> 00:35:20.734
>> So. they needed to. to get

1046
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.934
somebody else. a little bit

1047
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.033
stronger. a little bit more

1048
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.200
forceful. so they bring in the

1049
00:35:25.266 --> 00:35:26.734
closer.

1050
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.967
The closer is. is. uh. Elie

1051
00:35:29.033 --> 00:35:30.333
Assaad.

1052
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.600
And Elie Assaad was a

1053
00:35:31.667 --> 00:35:33.133
professional informant.

1054
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.767
He used to refer to himself to

1055
00:35:34.834 --> 00:35:36.500
his friends as Tony Montana

1056
00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:38.467
from the. uh. "Scarface." you

1057
00:35:38.533 --> 00:35:40.166
know. the. the evil character.

1058
00:35:40.233 --> 00:35:42.000
>> Are we ready?

1059
00:35:42.066 --> 00:35:43.166
>> You ready?

1060
00:35:43.233 --> 00:35:45.266
>> Hold on. one second.

1061
00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:47.567
>> Sure. okay.

1062
00:35:47.633 --> 00:35:48.533
>> When we initially got the

1063
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.667
information. we're looking at

1064
00:35:49.734 --> 00:35:51.100
this. and we're. like. "Do we

1065
00:35:51.166 --> 00:35:52.166
think that these guys really

1066
00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:52.867
wanna meet somebody from

1067
00:35:52.934 --> 00:35:54.567
Al-Qaeda?"

1068
00:35:54.633 --> 00:35:56.333
You know. common sense sort of

1069
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.367
suggested probably not. but

1070
00:35:59.433 --> 00:36:00.467
let's see where it goes.

1071
00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:02.166
And so we decided on using him

1072
00:36:02.233 --> 00:36:03.500
because we did not expect for it

1073
00:36:03.567 --> 00:36:05.333
to go beyond that first meeting.

1074
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.400
>> I'm good. I never lost a

1075
00:36:06.467 --> 00:36:08.700
case.

1076
00:36:08.767 --> 00:36:09.834
I never lost a case all these

1077
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.333
years-- even sometimes. uh.

1078
00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.800
when they have already on.

1079
00:36:15.867 --> 00:36:17.800
ongoing cases. where they feel

1080
00:36:17.867 --> 00:36:20.200
they gonna lose it. and they

1081
00:36:20.266 --> 00:36:22.133
bring me to. uh. jump in and put

1082
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.100
it back on track.

1083
00:36:25.166 --> 00:36:27.033
>> Abbas is talking about Elie

1084
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.300
Assaad. but he's using his name

1085
00:36:28.367 --> 00:36:29.400
as "Uncle."

1086
00:36:29.467 --> 00:36:31.567
Yeah. that's. that's his name.

1087
00:36:31.633 --> 00:36:33.266
Elie Assaad.

1088
00:36:33.333 --> 00:36:35.633
No good mother(bleep).

1089
00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:44.300
>> We rented a hotel room.

1090
00:36:44.367 --> 00:36:46.233
The Hilton. Downtown Miami.

1091
00:36:49.066 --> 00:36:50.867
Again. we set up surveillance so

1092
00:36:50.934 --> 00:36:52.700
we could capture the meeting in

1093
00:36:52.767 --> 00:36:55.066
video and audio.

1094
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.166
I'm in a room close by. where we

1095
00:37:02.233 --> 00:37:04.266
can monitor the meeting.

1096
00:37:05.934 --> 00:37:08.367
We also have a surveillance unit

1097
00:37:08.433 --> 00:37:10.934
outside of the hotel.

1098
00:37:14.433 --> 00:37:15.867
>> Abbas continued to call us

1099
00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:17.834
and call us until Elie Assaad

1100
00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.667
came and he called me on that

1101
00:37:19.734 --> 00:37:21.333
day to go meet him.

1102
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.934
He initially promised me. like.

1103
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.200
around 20 grand or whatever.

1104
00:37:24.266 --> 00:37:25.500
He said. "I'll have it for

1105
00:37:25.567 --> 00:37:27.166
you.

1106
00:37:27.233 --> 00:37:30.166
I just need you to meet him ."

1107
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.233
>> The surveillance team says.

1108
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.567
"You're not going to believe

1109
00:37:34.633 --> 00:37:35.967
this. but your subject is

1110
00:37:36.033 --> 00:37:37.867
walking down Biscayne Boulevard

1111
00:37:37.934 --> 00:37:39.834
in a white robe and a cane

1112
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:44.133
that's six feet tall. looking

1113
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.400
like Moses."

1114
00:37:45.467 --> 00:37:46.667
I got on the radio and I said.

1115
00:37:46.734 --> 00:37:48.200
"Are you sure it's our subject?"

1116
00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:49.200
And they're. like. "It's. it's

1117
00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:50.166
your guy."

1118
00:37:50.233 --> 00:37:51.333
I look at our team in the room

1119
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.967
and I'm. like. "What. what's

1120
00:37:53.033 --> 00:37:55.367
going on?"

1121
00:37:55.433 --> 00:37:57.400
>> Room 612. I knocked on the

1122
00:37:57.467 --> 00:37:58.967
door.

1123
00:37:59.033 --> 00:38:00.900
Assaad opened up the door and he

1124
00:38:00.967 --> 00:38:02.266
says. "Come on in. brother.

1125
00:38:02.333 --> 00:38:04.133
let's talk."

1126
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.800
I figured I could be slick

1127
00:38:10.867 --> 00:38:12.734
enough to say what I had to say

1128
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.667
in there and just get that

1129
00:38:13.734 --> 00:38:16.033
money and break off.

1130
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.200
>> Batiste doesn't blink.

1131
00:38:18.266 --> 00:38:19.500
He could have said. "Listen. I

1132
00:38:19.567 --> 00:38:21.000
was just joking. I'm going to a

1133
00:38:21.066 --> 00:38:23.567
Halloween party..."

1134
00:38:23.633 --> 00:38:24.633
And fine.

1135
00:38:50.567 --> 00:38:52.033
>> Elie Assaad.

1136
00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.133
He had somewhat of an ego

1137
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.233
if you will.

1138
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.400
>> I think he sort of felt he

1139
00:39:09.467 --> 00:39:10.600
needed to guide this

1140
00:39:10.667 --> 00:39:12.834
conversation more affirmatively.

1141
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.767
and at times I think he. he may

1142
00:39:15.834 --> 00:39:16.767
overdo it.

1143
00:39:40.266 --> 00:39:41.367
>> I was never good at being no

1144
00:39:41.433 --> 00:39:42.567
type of scam artist.

1145
00:39:42.633 --> 00:39:43.500
This is. this is the first time

1146
00:39:43.567 --> 00:39:44.467
in my life I'm ever really

1147
00:39:44.533 --> 00:39:46.033
trying to run a scam.

1148
00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:57.533
>> And he was. like. "All

1149
00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.700
right. so what do you need?"

1150
00:40:58.767 --> 00:40:59.533
I knew that I had to make

1151
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.400
something up right then and

1152
00:41:00.467 --> 00:41:01.367
there.

1153
00:41:01.433 --> 00:41:02.500
Course. I was not prepared for

1154
00:41:02.567 --> 00:41:03.433
any kind of list. I didn't bring

1155
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.734
any kind of list. because this

1156
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.633
was just something I was just

1157
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.266
brainstorming on.

1158
00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:08.066
So I wrote a whole bunch of

1159
00:41:08.133 --> 00:41:09.834
crazy things down on the list.

1160
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:10.867
I needed knee-high boots. things

1161
00:41:10.934 --> 00:41:11.800
that didn't make sense.

1162
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.867
>> Yes. I put guns on there.

1163
00:41:24.934 --> 00:41:25.734
I couldn't name them. he kept

1164
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.867
asking me the name for them.

1165
00:41:26.934 --> 00:41:27.700
I didn't know any name of guns.

1166
00:41:27.767 --> 00:41:28.834
'cause I never owned a gun.

1167
00:41:53.066 --> 00:41:55.300
The list that he took he tore

1168
00:41:55.367 --> 00:41:56.100
up several times. and

1169
00:41:56.166 --> 00:41:57.734
eventually. there was a list

1170
00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.000
that was made.

1171
00:41:59.066 --> 00:42:00.400
And he was. like. "I'll go back

1172
00:42:00.467 --> 00:42:01.633
and talk to Abbas about

1173
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:02.834
everything and we'll work on

1174
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.867
getting the money to you."

1175
00:42:08.133 --> 00:42:10.700
I left the room.

1176
00:42:10.767 --> 00:42:14.100
I felt a lot of fear.

1177
00:42:14.166 --> 00:42:15.400
I felt like a big cavity was

1178
00:42:15.467 --> 00:42:17.500
inside my chest.

1179
00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.033
Empty.

1180
00:42:33.233 --> 00:42:35.800
>> We're-- we're in the room and

1181
00:42:35.867 --> 00:42:37.166
we're. like. "Okay. well. what

1182
00:42:37.233 --> 00:42:37.767
happens now?"

1183
00:42:38.367 --> 00:42:41.133
So. we went back to the. uh. to

1184
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.867
the bullpen. and sat down and

1185
00:42:43.934 --> 00:42:45.934
says. "Okay. guys. it's. let's

1186
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.233
whiteboard this.

1187
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.000
What are. what are we gonna do?"

1188
00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:50.066
Okay? We could go knock on

1189
00:42:50.133 --> 00:42:52.033
Batiste's door and say. "Hey.

1190
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.867
listen. we...

1191
00:42:54.934 --> 00:42:55.967
You met with somebody who said

1192
00:42:56.033 --> 00:42:57.600
they were with Al-Qaeda.

1193
00:42:57.667 --> 00:42:58.867
Now. how serious are you?

1194
00:42:58.934 --> 00:43:00.934
'Cause if you're not. okay.

1195
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.700
you need to knock it off."

1196
00:43:02.767 --> 00:43:05.867
They could just... go off and

1197
00:43:05.934 --> 00:43:07.367
not do anything for another

1198
00:43:07.433 --> 00:43:09.000
year. or two years. or three

1199
00:43:09.066 --> 00:43:10.133
years.

1200
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.467
There aren't enough resources to

1201
00:43:11.533 --> 00:43:12.834
commit to that type of. you

1202
00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.533
know. monitoring.

1203
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:18.834
So. we wanted to find out. um.

1204
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:22.600
how committed Batiste was to

1205
00:43:22.667 --> 00:43:25.600
what he had told Elie Assaad.

1206
00:43:35.166 --> 00:43:36.233
>> This whole thing was way

1207
00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.066
beyond me.

1208
00:43:38.133 --> 00:43:39.900
The rhetoric and the talk and

1209
00:43:39.967 --> 00:43:41.934
the relationship with Abbas just

1210
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.100
went... way out of control.

1211
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.300
My hustle wasn't even talking

1212
00:44:01.367 --> 00:44:03.266
about terrorists at the very

1213
00:44:03.333 --> 00:44:05.100
beginning.

1214
00:44:05.166 --> 00:44:07.000
I was slowly wielded into that

1215
00:44:07.066 --> 00:44:08.433
with Abbas.

1216
00:44:19.967 --> 00:44:22.033
>> He really set these guys up.

1217
00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.767
There's really no other way for

1218
00:44:23.834 --> 00:44:25.633
me to put it.

1219
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.300
Abbas saw. from working in the

1220
00:44:27.367 --> 00:44:28.934
store. that these men didn't

1221
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.233
have a lot of money.

1222
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.567
And he also played on that.

1223
00:44:31.633 --> 00:44:32.600
that they were poor.

1224
00:44:47.633 --> 00:44:49.333
>> They just kept getting pushed

1225
00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.900
forward and forward and forward

1226
00:44:50.967 --> 00:44:52.200
by Abbas.

1227
00:44:52.266 --> 00:44:53.600
And Abbas is putting all these

1228
00:44:53.667 --> 00:44:55.633
ideas in their head.

1229
00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:56.667
It was like a big joke to him at

1230
00:44:56.734 --> 00:44:59.133
home. it was...

1231
00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.166
All he could do was laugh about

1232
00:45:00.233 --> 00:45:01.500
it. it...

1233
00:45:01.567 --> 00:45:03.300
He thought it was hilarious.

1234
00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:04.300
He was. like. "I can't believe

1235
00:45:04.367 --> 00:45:05.934
they think I'm really Al-Qaeda."

1236
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.233
It didn't matter if that's how

1237
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.834
he was gonna get his money. if

1238
00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.500
that's how the FBI was gonna pay

1239
00:45:10.567 --> 00:45:11.700
him.

1240
00:45:30.467 --> 00:45:32.834
>> In the informant world. are

1241
00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.700
they paid?

1242
00:45:34.767 --> 00:45:36.133
Of course they're paid.

1243
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.567
They got paid expenses.

1244
00:45:38.633 --> 00:45:39.834
It wasn't. like. "Hey. listen.

1245
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.367
if you get a conviction. you're

1246
00:45:41.433 --> 00:45:42.433
gonna get a hundred. a hundred

1247
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:43.200
thousand dollars."

1248
00:45:43.266 --> 00:45:44.367
That's not how we operate.

1249
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.367
I finally get a call from Abbas

1250
00:45:55.433 --> 00:45:57.367
telling me. "Look. um. Assaad

1251
00:45:57.433 --> 00:45:58.867
definitely wants to meet with

1252
00:45:58.934 --> 00:45:59.900
you-- he's got the money. you

1253
00:45:59.967 --> 00:46:01.934
just have to pick him up."

1254
00:46:03.633 --> 00:46:04.867
He told me that. "If you gonna

1255
00:46:04.934 --> 00:46:06.066
get the money. you gotta make it

1256
00:46:06.133 --> 00:46:08.066
sound for real.

1257
00:46:08.133 --> 00:46:09.667
Talk big. like you gonna blow

1258
00:46:09.734 --> 00:46:11.000
something up."

1259
00:46:11.066 --> 00:46:11.834
He said. "If you say that.

1260
00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.100
they're gonna come through."

1261
00:46:14.166 --> 00:46:15.300
I was high off marijuana one

1262
00:46:15.367 --> 00:46:16.233
time when we was riding in the

1263
00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.400
back seat of a car. and he

1264
00:46:17.467 --> 00:46:19.066
whispered over to me. says. "You

1265
00:46:19.133 --> 00:46:20.000
got anything in mind you could

1266
00:46:20.066 --> 00:46:20.934
say big?

1267
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:21.934
Say. you're from Chicago. you

1268
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:22.800
should be able to come up with

1269
00:46:22.867 --> 00:46:23.667
something."

1270
00:46:23.734 --> 00:46:24.500
And I thought in my mind. "Well.

1271
00:46:24.567 --> 00:46:25.300
the Sears Tower. I guess I'll

1272
00:46:25.367 --> 00:46:25.967
blow that up. how does that

1273
00:46:26.033 --> 00:46:26.967
sound?"

1274
00:46:27.033 --> 00:46:28.000
And he cracked up laughing and

1275
00:46:28.066 --> 00:46:29.600
he said. "That would be great."

1276
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.600
>> That was the basic

1277
00:46:47.667 --> 00:46:48.633
motivation of it. was. the whole

1278
00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.200
thing was about who could scam

1279
00:46:50.266 --> 00:46:52.233
who out of the money.

1280
00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.834
>> Did you think that that could

1281
00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.300
go wrong for you?

1282
00:46:55.367 --> 00:46:57.967
>> Yes.

1283
00:46:58.033 --> 00:46:59.633
Did I linger on that thought?

1284
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.567
No.

1285
00:48:09.667 --> 00:48:11.800
>> He's gonna give you money.

1286
00:48:11.867 --> 00:48:13.033
What the (bleep) you think the

1287
00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:15.533
money is for?

1288
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.533
Terrorism.

1289
00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.767
He wants you to do an act. just

1290
00:48:18.834 --> 00:48:20.834
like a. uh. murder for hire.

1291
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.367
What's present in our mind is.

1292
00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:24.667
"When you give it to me. I'm not

1293
00:48:24.734 --> 00:48:26.300
killing nobody.

1294
00:48:26.367 --> 00:48:28.667
This is mine. (bleep) you.

1295
00:48:28.734 --> 00:48:30.266
What you gonna do?

1296
00:48:30.333 --> 00:48:31.033
'Cause if you really that

1297
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:31.900
powerful. you would have had

1298
00:48:31.967 --> 00:48:33.166
your own crew right here.

1299
00:48:33.233 --> 00:48:34.767
You ain't (bleep).

1300
00:48:34.834 --> 00:48:36.066
You just a rich mother(bleep)

1301
00:48:36.133 --> 00:48:38.133
that is gonna give the money to

1302
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.200
us and then you gonna

1303
00:48:39.266 --> 00:48:40.200
disappear."

1304
00:48:40.266 --> 00:48:41.367
>> Whoa. man. it's. like.

1305
00:48:41.433 --> 00:48:43.600
terrorism.

1306
00:48:43.667 --> 00:48:45.000
You know. it never popped in

1307
00:48:45.066 --> 00:48:46.500
our mind like. "Yo. this is

1308
00:48:46.567 --> 00:48:48.433
something serious."

1309
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.400
It's like these two (bleep) fake

1310
00:48:50.467 --> 00:48:51.834
guys playing some (bleep)-damned

1311
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.266
game.

1312
00:48:53.333 --> 00:48:55.033
Batiste fighting for control

1313
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.000
over some damn donations. and it

1314
00:48:57.066 --> 00:48:59.433
was-- it all made me sick.

1315
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.834
>> I wanna prove these guys

1316
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.200
didn't wanna do this.

1317
00:49:04.266 --> 00:49:06.500
I wanna prove that this

1318
00:49:06.567 --> 00:49:07.934
conversation that the informant

1319
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.900
may have misquoted didn't

1320
00:49:09.967 --> 00:49:11.300
happen.

1321
00:49:11.367 --> 00:49:13.133
And this is what it is.

1322
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.233
But that's not what happened.

1323
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.967
Every time I thought we were

1324
00:49:17.033 --> 00:49:19.200
gonna get off the highway. we

1325
00:49:19.266 --> 00:49:21.567
hit another mile marker.

1326
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.934
>> Yeah. he left yesterday.

1327
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.867
>> (exhales)

1328
00:49:26.934 --> 00:49:28.600
>> He left yesterday. so...

1329
00:49:46.333 --> 00:49:47.367
>> I was taking a lot of

1330
00:49:47.433 --> 00:49:48.500
marijuana substance.

1331
00:49:48.567 --> 00:49:49.800
At least an ounce every two

1332
00:49:49.867 --> 00:49:52.200
days. and it had me living in a

1333
00:49:52.266 --> 00:49:53.734
world of fear.

1334
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.100
And fear was pulling all of this

1335
00:49:55.166 --> 00:49:57.767
into a detrimental path with

1336
00:49:57.834 --> 00:49:59.967
myself.

1337
00:50:00.033 --> 00:50:01.700
As far as trusting my own. uh.

1338
00:50:01.767 --> 00:50:03.200
judgment of what's right and

1339
00:50:03.266 --> 00:50:06.166
wrong. in terms of the scam. of

1340
00:50:06.233 --> 00:50:07.667
going further or not.

1341
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.133
>> Whenever I. I. you know. my

1342
00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.266
attention fell on him. it's

1343
00:50:27.333 --> 00:50:28.700
like. "Yeah. he talking.

1344
00:50:28.767 --> 00:50:30.433
talking crazy.

1345
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:31.700
You know. doing all of that just

1346
00:50:31.767 --> 00:50:33.533
to get the. convince the guy

1347
00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.266
to get you some money."

1348
00:50:53.266 --> 00:50:54.934
I was just trying to get into

1349
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.367
Assaad's head. you know. say

1350
00:50:56.433 --> 00:50:58.166
what would make him happy.

1351
00:50:58.233 --> 00:50:59.233
'Cause he kept looking at me

1352
00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:00.967
like. you know. "I need more.

1353
00:51:01.033 --> 00:51:02.433
Say something more."

1354
00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.533
>> This guy just make a

1355
00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.433
crazy-ass statement and then.

1356
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.500
less than ten second later. he's

1357
00:51:20.567 --> 00:51:22.734
in a basketball game.

1358
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.300
The TV faced us.

1359
00:51:25.834 --> 00:51:27.934
So. a lot of time. you see me

1360
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.667
there. I'm. I'm looking. I'm

1361
00:51:30.734 --> 00:51:32.000
watching the game.

1362
00:52:18.834 --> 00:52:20.166
I wasn't feeling good about

1363
00:52:20.233 --> 00:52:21.000
what I was saying.

1364
00:52:21.066 --> 00:52:22.333
But at the time. I felt like I

1365
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.900
had to. to make up this story

1366
00:52:24.967 --> 00:52:26.066
one more time for this guy.

1367
00:52:26.133 --> 00:52:27.333
So. I was just constantly just

1368
00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.200
flipping through different

1369
00:52:28.266 --> 00:52:29.100
pictures in my mind that I seen

1370
00:52:29.166 --> 00:52:30.633
on the media.

1371
00:52:38.133 --> 00:52:39.934
I grabbed that from just end of

1372
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000
world type of movies.

1373
00:52:41.066 --> 00:52:42.133
'Cause a lot of that was going

1374
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.200
on at the time.

1375
00:52:43.266 --> 00:52:44.533
Tidal waves type of movies.

1376
00:52:53.567 --> 00:52:55.834
>> (clapping)

1377
00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:57.700
>> I'm not gonna do anything.

1378
00:52:57.767 --> 00:52:58.500
I'm just talking a whole bunch

1379
00:52:58.567 --> 00:53:00.066
of crap here.

1380
00:53:00.133 --> 00:53:16.367
And I'm high.

1381
00:53:16.433 --> 00:53:19.867
>> If Batiste is having these

1382
00:53:19.934 --> 00:53:23.467
conversations with somebody he

1383
00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:26.066
believes is from Al-Qaeda. you

1384
00:53:26.133 --> 00:53:28.900
know. Al-Qaeda would say. "Okay.

1385
00:53:28.967 --> 00:53:30.467
maybe. maybe we should target

1386
00:53:30.533 --> 00:53:32.100
the Sears Tower.

1387
00:53:32.166 --> 00:53:33.166
And. and. and by the way. you

1388
00:53:33.233 --> 00:53:35.834
think we should. as the

1389
00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.600
survivors run out. shoot them?

1390
00:53:37.667 --> 00:53:38.767
We didn't even think of that.

1391
00:53:38.834 --> 00:53:40.100
Write that down."

1392
00:53:53.934 --> 00:53:56.367
(laughs)

1393
00:53:56.433 --> 00:53:58.934
>> Dude.

1394
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.233
You. you. you really have to do

1395
00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.934
all of that?

1396
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.200
Did you have to really. doing

1397
00:54:05.266 --> 00:54:06.834
all that back and forth with the

1398
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:07.667
guy?

1399
00:54:07.734 --> 00:54:09.400
"Yeah. he. he gonna. you know.

1400
00:54:09.467 --> 00:54:10.233
I'm gonna get the money.

1401
00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:11.533
I'm gonna get the money."

1402
00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.734
All right. whatever. man.

1403
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.000
>> I was sick of it.

1404
00:54:17.066 --> 00:54:18.266
Matter of fact. I remember.

1405
00:54:18.333 --> 00:54:21.367
uh. when I went home. I got

1406
00:54:21.433 --> 00:54:22.900
sick somehow or another. I was

1407
00:54:22.967 --> 00:54:26.734
doing a lot of vomiting.

1408
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.400
>> It's. like. "Okay. let's say

1409
00:54:28.467 --> 00:54:29.533
he is crazy.

1410
00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.533
That's a dangerous dialogue."

1411
00:54:34.066 --> 00:54:37.033
We never expected. again. to get

1412
00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:40.133
to where we ended up. because we

1413
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.667
thought at some point. he would

1414
00:54:41.734 --> 00:54:43.834
say. "Look. this is what I'm...

1415
00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:45.633
This is all a charade."

1416
00:54:47.834 --> 00:54:49.633
>> Director Mueller was being

1417
00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:50.867
briefed daily.

1418
00:54:50.934 --> 00:54:51.633
And we knew that this was

1419
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:52.633
included in his presidential

1420
00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:54.133
briefs.

1421
00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.400
That brief is. "Look. there's a

1422
00:54:55.467 --> 00:54:57.667
group of kids in Miami-Dade that

1423
00:54:57.734 --> 00:54:59.900
formed an organization. that

1424
00:54:59.967 --> 00:55:00.934
want to align themselves with

1425
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.934
Al-Qaeda to start a war in the

1426
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.667
United States."

1427
00:55:06.233 --> 00:55:07.533
>> The prosecutors wanted more

1428
00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.400
overt acts.

1429
00:55:09.467 --> 00:55:11.700
So anytime there's a conspiracy

1430
00:55:11.767 --> 00:55:13.333
involved. you have to have overt

1431
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.967
acts in furtherance of that

1432
00:55:15.033 --> 00:55:16.433
conspiracy.

1433
00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.567
Anything that a prosecutor could

1434
00:55:19.633 --> 00:55:22.300
use as evidence to convince a

1435
00:55:22.367 --> 00:55:24.066
judge or jury that these people

1436
00:55:24.133 --> 00:55:25.667
were serious.

1437
00:55:25.734 --> 00:55:28.100
>> A conversation is an act.

1438
00:55:28.166 --> 00:55:30.433
So. uh. you don't need to pick

1439
00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:33.433
up a gun or. or let off a bomb

1440
00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:34.967
or make a bomb for it to be an

1441
00:55:35.033 --> 00:55:37.033
overt act.

1442
00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.867
I think the idea came from the

1443
00:55:38.934 --> 00:55:41.800
FBI through C.I.A.. and the idea

1444
00:55:41.867 --> 00:55:44.100
was to have some sort of formal

1445
00:55:44.166 --> 00:55:45.934
allegiance. some pledge to

1446
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.467
Al-Qaeda. to see if they went

1447
00:55:47.533 --> 00:55:50.166
forward with it.

1448
00:55:50.233 --> 00:55:52.734
>> The idea was introduced to

1449
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.266
further test their commitment to

1450
00:55:55.333 --> 00:55:57.200
their interest in aligning with

1451
00:55:57.266 --> 00:55:59.467
Al-Qaeda by saying. "Well. look.

1452
00:55:59.533 --> 00:56:00.867
you have to take an oath of

1453
00:56:00.934 --> 00:56:02.700
loyalty."

>> Assaad came by the temple.

1456
00:56:09.867 --> 00:56:10.900
He says. "The reason why I hold

1457
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.033
back the money from you is

1458
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:12.967
because you don't have a

1459
00:56:13.033 --> 00:56:14.033
commitment."

1460
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.033
I said. "Well. what do you

1461
00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.033
mean?"

1462
00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.033
He says. "We gotta have some

1463
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:17.900
type of commitment between us."

1464
00:56:17.967 --> 00:56:20.166
And he didn't call it an oath or

1465
00:56:20.233 --> 00:56:22.233
any. uh. swearing allegiance to

1466
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.266
any organization or anything.

1467
00:56:24.333 --> 00:56:26.567
He says. "Just a commitment."

1468
00:56:26.633 --> 00:56:27.834
So he says. "Well. we have to

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:28.767

01:20:34.033 --> 01:20:35.734
And so. I described it as an.

2048
01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.033
that this was an aspirational

2049
01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.166
group rather than an operational

2050
01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:39.266
group.

2051
01:20:39.333 --> 01:20:40.333
In terms of the plans. it was

2052
01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.567
more aspirational than. than

2053
01:20:41.633 --> 01:20:43.300
operational.

2054
01:20:43.367 --> 01:20:44.500
>> I think the public and the

2055
01:20:44.567 --> 01:20:46.133
media began to realize very

2056
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.767
quickly that this was just not a

2057
01:20:47.834 --> 01:20:49.266
strong case.

2058
01:20:49.333 --> 01:20:51.266
That it was a weak case.

2059
01:20:51.333 --> 01:20:52.200
>> It looks like these guys were

2060
01:20:52.266 --> 01:20:53.266
actually asking for material

2061
01:20:53.333 --> 01:20:54.433
support from what they thought

2062
01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.600
was Al-Qaeda.

2063
01:20:55.667 --> 01:20:57.066
These. these guys couldn't buy

2064
01:20:57.133 --> 01:20:58.233
boots on their own?

2065
01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:00.033
They don't sound like very

2066
01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.767
sophisticated or. or. you know.

2067
01:21:01.834 --> 01:21:03.500
effective operators.

2068
01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:05.967
>> These guys didn't have. you

2069
01:21:06.033 --> 01:21:09.300
know. the ability to. you know.

2070
01:21:09.367 --> 01:21:11.266
blow up anything. let alone the

2071
01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:12.700
Sears Tower.

2072
01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:13.867
>> Did you find any explosives.

2073
01:21:13.934 --> 01:21:14.734
weapons...?

2074
01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.700
>> And you raise a. a good

2075
01:21:16.767 --> 01:21:17.700
point.

2076
01:21:17.767 --> 01:21:18.700
You know. you know. our

2077
01:21:18.767 --> 01:21:20.533
philosophy here is that we try

2078
01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.033
to identify plots in the

2079
01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:24.266
earliest stages possible.

2080
01:21:24.333 --> 01:21:26.500
because we don't know what we.

2081
01:21:26.567 --> 01:21:28.033
what we don't know about.

2082
01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.900
about a terrorism plot.

2083
01:21:29.967 --> 01:21:31.433
>> You know. I hate to criticize

2084
01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.967
an attorney general. but when he

2085
01:21:33.033 --> 01:21:34.767
said. "We had taken out an

2086
01:21:34.834 --> 01:21:38.266
Al-Qaeda cell." yes. I...

2087
01:21:38.333 --> 01:21:40.266
I knew that was going to be a

2088
01:21:40.333 --> 01:21:43.066
problem.

2089
01:21:43.133 --> 01:21:45.133
He went overboard.

2090
01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.767
They were not an Al-Qaeda cell.

2091
01:21:46.834 --> 01:21:47.900
They were not directed by

2092
01:21:47.967 --> 01:21:48.934
Al-Qaeda.

2093
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.066
You know. that is an

2094
01:21:50.133 --> 01:21:51.300
overstatement.

2095
01:21:51.367 --> 01:21:52.600
So the charges were valid.

2096
01:21:52.667 --> 01:21:54.233
It was. it was the over-hyping

2097
01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.767
of the case.

2098
01:21:55.834 --> 01:21:56.900
>> So they're charged with

2099
01:21:56.967 --> 01:21:58.033
providing material support to a

2100
01:21:58.100 --> 01:21:59.467
terrorist organization. namely

2101
01:21:59.533 --> 01:22:01.633
Al-Qaeda. even though there was

2102
01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:03.266
no actual connection to

2103
01:22:03.333 --> 01:22:04.900
Al-Qaeda.

2104
01:22:04.967 --> 01:22:06.000
>> The problem with terrorism

2105
01:22:06.066 --> 01:22:07.567
cases is. you have to stop the

2106
01:22:07.633 --> 01:22:09.266
act.

2107
01:22:09.333 --> 01:22:11.200
And so. you really. in a way.

2108
01:22:11.266 --> 01:22:12.934
have to predict who's going to

2109
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.934
do what.

2110
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.700
And so. stings are very

2111
01:22:16.767 --> 01:22:17.967
important. but if you overstate

2112
01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:20.767
what you have done in a sting.

2113
01:22:20.834 --> 01:22:23.166
then people begin to lose

2114
01:22:23.233 --> 01:22:24.633
confidence in what you're doing.

2115
01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:25.967
They think that you're just out

2116
01:22:26.033 --> 01:22:27.300
there creating a terrorist

2117
01:22:27.367 --> 01:22:28.633
yourself.

2118
01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:29.667
>> I had been doing undercover

2119
01:22:29.734 --> 01:22:31.533
work in terrorism cases for a

2120
01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:33.266
decade before 9/11.

2121
01:22:33.333 --> 01:22:35.600
And before 9/11. if I had called

2122
01:22:35.667 --> 01:22:38.433
FBI headquarters and said. "I

2123
01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:39.900
want to initiate an undercover

2124
01:22:39.967 --> 01:22:41.600
operation targeting a terrorist

2125
01:22:41.667 --> 01:22:44.300
group." uh. the first question

2126
01:22:44.367 --> 01:22:45.600
they would have asked me is.

2127
01:22:45.667 --> 01:22:46.533
"Okay. what terrorist group do

2128
01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.800
this. these individuals belong

2129
01:22:47.867 --> 01:22:49.100
to?"

2130
01:22:49.166 --> 01:22:50.834
And if I said. "Well. they don't

2131
01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:52.033
actually belong to a terrorist

2132
01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.300
group. they're just saying

2133
01:22:53.367 --> 01:22:55.166
things that sound kind of scary

2134
01:22:55.233 --> 01:22:56.900
and things that terrorists

2135
01:22:56.967 --> 01:22:58.166
might say."

2136
01:22:58.233 --> 01:22:59.467
And they would say. "Okay. well.

2137
01:22:59.533 --> 01:23:00.500
what kind of weapons do they

2138
01:23:00.567 --> 01:23:01.533
have?"

2139
01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.166
And if I replied. "Well. they

2140
01:23:03.233 --> 01:23:04.500
don't actually have any weapons.

2141
01:23:04.567 --> 01:23:06.100
and part of the plot would be

2142
01:23:06.166 --> 01:23:08.734
to supply them with weapons."

2143
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:09.834
And then they would say. "Well.

2144
01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.033
what plot do they have in mind?"

2145
01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:13.133
And I would say. "Well. they

2146
01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.500
haven't actually identified a

2147
01:23:14.567 --> 01:23:15.333
plot yet.

2148
01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.500
Part of the operation would be

2149
01:23:16.567 --> 01:23:18.700
to identify a plot and then

2150
01:23:18.767 --> 01:23:20.834
provide them the weapons so that

2151
01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:22.533
they could be terrorists."

2152
01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:25.100
Uh. they would have sent me

2153
01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:26.333
for counseling.

2154
01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.266
>> Thank you.

2155
01:23:27.333 --> 01:23:29.033
>> Thank you.

2156
01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:31.000
>> Through 2005 and 2006. there

2157
01:23:31.066 --> 01:23:32.633
had been a very heated debate

2158
01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:35.066
over extending expiring

2159
01:23:35.133 --> 01:23:36.500
provisions of the Patriot Act.

2160
01:23:36.567 --> 01:23:37.934
So I think that there was great

2161
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.633
pressure on the FBI to

2162
01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.433
demonstrate both that there was

2163
01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.667
a powerful threat that still

2164
01:23:44.734 --> 01:23:46.333
existed inside the United States

2165
01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:47.667
that justified this expanded

2166
01:23:47.734 --> 01:23:50.433
surveillance authority. and that

2167
01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.867
the tools that they had been

2168
01:23:52.934 --> 01:23:53.934
given through the Patriot Act

2169
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
were actually effective in

2170
01:23:55.066 --> 01:23:57.834
identifying these plots.

2171
01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:01.033

You know. so...

2255
01:26:52.433 --> 01:26:53.800
Yeah. nobody was willing to

2256
01:26:53.867 --> 01:26:55.867

terrorism.

2258
01:26:56.934 --> 01:26:57.934
But more so. nobody was willing

to...

2260
01:27:05.333 --> 01:27:06.567
Yeah. nobody was willing to send

01:27:07.667 --> 01:27:08.734
what we was out there doing in

road for a charge that. that

2265
01:27:12.967 --> 01:27:14.433
wasn't us.

2266
01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.033
>> I refused every plea.

2267
01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:16.934
I talked to my lawyer. I told my

2268
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:17.834
lawyer-- my lawyer couldn't

2269
01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:18.700
understand it.

2270
01:27:18.767 --> 01:27:19.667
I told him that's basically how

2271
01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:20.567
I got to be. because I was

2272
01:27:20.633 --> 01:27:21.700
with these brothers.

2273
01:27:21.767 --> 01:27:23.100
I knew what they was about.

2274
01:27:23.166 --> 01:27:25.633
I knew if I get. take any plea.

2275
01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:27.133
even regardless of plea that

2276
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.166
said that I didn't know nothing

2277
01:27:28.233 --> 01:27:29.266
about that. then I'm. then it

2278
01:27:29.333 --> 01:27:31.467
actually saying something about

2279
01:27:31.533 --> 01:27:33.066
my. my brothers that's left in

2280
01:27:33.133 --> 01:27:34.200
there that I knew they was not

2281
01:27:34.266 --> 01:27:35.367
about what they say they was

2282
01:27:35.433 --> 01:27:36.767
about.

2283
01:27:36.834 --> 01:27:37.700
>> Prosecutors laid out their

2284
01:27:37.767 --> 01:27:39.166
case against seven men dubbed

2285
01:27:39.233 --> 01:27:40.934
the Liberty City Seven. accused

2286
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.533
of conspiring to blow up the

2287
01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:45.133
Sears Tower in Chicago.

2288
01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.166
>> You have to understand that.

2289
01:27:47.233 --> 01:27:49.200
in the counter-terrorism field.

2290
01:27:49.266 --> 01:27:51.033
the criminal penalties

2291
01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:52.500
associated with the laws that

2292
01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:53.767
are used. particularly laws like

2293
01:27:53.834 --> 01:27:55.100
the material support for

2294
01:27:55.166 --> 01:27:56.834
terrorism law. come with

2295
01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:58.400
draconian penalties.

2296
01:27:58.467 --> 01:27:59.767
So. if a defense attorney went

2297
01:27:59.834 --> 01:28:01.734
to a client who was charged with

2298
01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:03.400
terrorism charges and said.

2299
01:28:03.467 --> 01:28:04.767
"Hey. look. you know. you're

2300
01:28:04.834 --> 01:28:06.533
looking at 30 or 40 years in

2301
01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:07.800
jail if you go to trial and are

2302
01:28:07.867 --> 01:28:09.900
convicted. but the government's

2303
01:28:09.967 --> 01:28:11.834
offering you to plead out to

2304
01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.200
five years." even somebody who

2305
01:28:13.266 --> 01:28:14.867
is entirely innocent or

2306
01:28:14.934 --> 01:28:17.867
believes that they were induced

2307
01:28:17.934 --> 01:28:18.934
into committing some kind of

2308
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.533
crime. it wouldn't be unusual

2309
01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.900
for them to plead guilty to it.

2310
01:28:23.967 --> 01:28:26.734
So. the Liberty City Seven case

2311
01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.100
was fascinating to me. both

2312
01:28:29.166 --> 01:28:32.100
because it showed me that all of

2313
01:28:32.166 --> 01:28:33.400
the defendants were willing to

2314
01:28:33.467 --> 01:28:35.734
go to trial. showed me that they

2315
01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.967
were convinced they had done

2316
01:28:37.033 --> 01:28:38.100
nothing wrong.

2317
01:28:38.166 --> 01:28:39.533
And moreover. it gave one of the

2318
01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:40.834
very first opportunities to

2319
01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:43.500
really examine the FBI's

2320
01:28:43.567 --> 01:28:45.667
tactics. because all of the

2321
01:28:45.734 --> 01:28:47.100
information would come out

2322
01:28:47.166 --> 01:28:48.433
through the criminal trial.

2323
01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:49.633
>> The challenge for the Liberty

2324
01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.100
Seven defense: the suspects did

2325
01:28:51.166 --> 01:28:53.100
indeed pledge an oath to

2326
01:28:53.166 --> 01:28:55.266
Al-Qaeda.

2327
01:28:55.333 --> 01:28:56.266
>> When you have the attorney

2328
01:28:56.333 --> 01:28:58.000
general of the United States

2329
01:28:58.066 --> 01:28:59.834
having a press conference. I

2330
01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:01.400
realized that I was in for a

2331
01:29:01.467 --> 01:29:06.000
major battle going forward.

2332
01:29:06.066 --> 01:29:07.266
Our story was a simple one: they

2333
01:29:07.333 --> 01:29:08.133
didn't have the manner and

2334
01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.567
means. they had no money-- they

2335
01:29:09.633 --> 01:29:11.734
barely had vehicles.

2336
01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:15.900
They didn't have horses and they

2337
01:29:15.967 --> 01:29:18.100
certainly didn't have bombs.

2338
01:29:18.166 --> 01:29:19.166
This is a case manufactured

2339
01:29:19.233 --> 01:29:20.367
primarily by the government. or

2340
01:29:20.433 --> 01:29:21.900
in my case. my client's case.

2341
01:29:21.967 --> 01:29:23.467
this wasn't his idea.

2342
01:29:23.533 --> 01:29:24.633
It was just a complete. you

2343
01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.433
know. setup by the government.

2344
01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:27.867
The plot was being moved forward

2345
01:29:27.934 --> 01:29:31.300
by the informants and the FBI.

2346
01:29:31.367 --> 01:29:34.033
Who directed their activities.

2347
01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:35.900
They ran this whole show.

2348
01:29:35.967 --> 01:29:37.800
They. they provided the script.

2349
01:29:37.867 --> 01:29:40.300
They provided the choreography.

2350
01:29:40.367 --> 01:29:41.734
okay?

2351
01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.300
They provided the direction.

2352
01:29:43.367 --> 01:29:45.467
This was not a terrorist case at

2353
01:29:45.533 --> 01:29:48.600
all. let alone a case where the

2354
01:29:48.667 --> 01:29:51.567
actors. the defendants. were

2355
01:29:51.633 --> 01:29:54.700
moving the plot forward.

2356
01:29:54.767 --> 01:29:55.734
>> They invented the players.

2357
01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:57.333
they invented the theme. they

2358
01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:58.633
invented how it was gonna go

2359
01:29:58.700 --> 01:29:59.767
down.

2360
01:29:59.834 --> 01:30:01.400
They. they wrote this script.

2361
01:30:01.467 --> 01:30:03.200
They wrote this script.

2362
01:30:03.266 --> 01:30:03.967
>> One of the other defense

2363
01:30:04.033 --> 01:30:04.867
attorneys said this was all

2364
01:30:04.934 --> 01:30:07.300
really a inner-city scam.

2365
01:30:07.367 --> 01:30:08.333
>> Well. we do know that. first

2366
01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:09.967
of all. that one of the things

2367
01:30:10.033 --> 01:30:11.066
that was done in this case was

2368
01:30:11.133 --> 01:30:13.133
that there was a serious

2369
01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.266
question with regard to $50.000

2370
01:30:14.333 --> 01:30:15.600
being given to these individuals

2371
01:30:15.667 --> 01:30:17.066
to help them to revitalize this

2372
01:30:17.133 --> 01:30:18.233
building.

2373
01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:19.367
Here's Narseal saying. "We've

2374
01:30:19.433 --> 01:30:20.767
gotta get this $50.000. so. man.

2375
01:30:20.834 --> 01:30:22.233
just go along with this plan

2376
01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:23.533
for me. and then we're gonna be

2377
01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.200
good after that.

2378
01:30:25.266 --> 01:30:26.200
Just go along with it.

2379
01:30:26.266 --> 01:30:27.233
No. we're not gonna do anything.

2380
01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:28.400
but just go along with it."

2381
01:30:28.467 --> 01:30:29.567
>> And so. the defense became

2382
01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:31.100
that. that these guys were doing

2383
01:30:31.166 --> 01:30:32.667
this just for the money. that

2384
01:30:32.734 --> 01:30:34.700
this was one big scam.

2385
01:30:34.767 --> 01:30:37.467
>> It would have been a scam.

2386
01:30:37.533 --> 01:30:39.100
It would have been a scam had he

2387
01:30:39.166 --> 01:30:41.433
given us pictures of the Waffle

2388
01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.967
House.

2389
01:30:44.033 --> 01:30:46.000
Or. you know. given us a blank

2390
01:30:46.066 --> 01:30:47.734
disc.

2391
01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:51.834
Or. or just not have given us

2392
01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:54.000
footage of the FBI office. the

2393
01:30:54.066 --> 01:30:56.934
U.S. attorney's office. and the

2394
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.467
Miami Police Department.

2395
01:30:58.533 --> 01:31:01.834
So. it's not a scam.

2396
01:31:02.734 --> 01:31:04.467
I mean. that is a. an executed

2397
01:31:04.533 --> 01:31:05.433
agreement.

2398
01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:06.467
>> Whether these people were

2399
01:31:06.533 --> 01:31:08.100
being paid or not. the question

2400
01:31:08.166 --> 01:31:10.233
is. are they willing to commit

2401
01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:12.266
these acts?

2402
01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:14.000
Whether it's for money or it's

2403
01:31:14.066 --> 01:31:16.000
for free.

2404
01:31:16.333 --> 01:31:19.166
So it really made no difference.

2405
01:31:19.233 --> 01:31:20.233
>> Prosecutors told the jury

2406
01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:22.166
they'll hear from among 15.000

2407
01:31:22.233 --> 01:31:23.767
government recordings of the

2408
01:31:23.834 --> 01:31:26.200
group's plan to create chaos.

2409
01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:47.000
>> I'm hearing this for the

2410
01:31:47.066 --> 01:31:48.533
first time.

2411
01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.667
Now I know why we got indicted.

2412
01:31:50.734 --> 01:31:51.900
Because in my mind. I thought

2413
01:31:51.967 --> 01:31:54.166
the only meetings that occurred

2414
01:31:54.233 --> 01:31:56.300
was the ones I was there.

2415
01:32:01.934 --> 01:32:04.500

15-year-old son's funeral when

2603
01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.533

2604

2605
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.500

2606
01:38:02.567 --> 01:38:06.367

2612
01:38:12.467 --> 01:38:15.033

2614

America's a great country.

2624
01:38:31.166 --> 01:38:33.600
But what happened to us. it's

2625
01:38:33.667 --> 01:38:35.500
not America that did it.

2626
01:38:35.567 --> 01:38:37.333

2627
01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.900

2636
01:38:55.834 --> 01:38:57.400
arrested somebody and called

2637
01:38:57.467 --> 01:38:58.867
them a terrorist. and then drop

2638
01:38:58.934 --> 01:39:00.667
the case against them after one

2639
01:39:00.734 --> 01:39:01.800

2640
01:39:01.867 --> 01:39:02.734
gonna let them back out on the

2641
01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:04.100

2642
01:39:04.166 --> 01:39:05.266

2646

2647
01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:12.867
the same reasons.

2648
01:39:12.934 --> 01:39:14.000
>> We did. we tried it again.

2649
01:39:14.066 --> 01:39:15.967
and there was another mistrial.

2650
01:39:16.033 --> 01:39:17.767

2652
01:39:19.166 --> 01:39:20.300
Prosecutors now have a week to

2653
01:39:20.367 --> 01:39:21.567

2654
01:39:21.633 --> 01:39:23.567
them for a third time.

2655
01:39:23.633 --> 01:39:25.600
>> When that trial came to. um.

2656
01:39:25.667 --> 01:39:29.133
a hung jury again. we just knew

2657
01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:30.533
they was gonna throw this case

2658
01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:31.567
out.

2659
01:39:31.633 --> 01:39:32.633
There ain't no way they coming

2660
01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:34.333
back again for another trial

2661
01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:35.500

2662
01:39:35.567 --> 01:39:36.767
embarrassing.

2663
01:39:36.834 --> 01:39:38.000
>> My experience has been. it's.

2664
01:39:38.066 --> 01:39:39.467
it's two times and they're done.

2665
01:39:39.533 --> 01:39:40.667
But it depends on the case.

2666
01:39:40.734 --> 01:39:41.700
If they want somebody bad

2667
01:39:41.767 --> 01:39:44.233
enough. they continue to go

2668
01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:45.500
after the person.

2669
01:39:45.567 --> 01:39:46.767
And they wanted these guys.

2670
01:39:46.834 --> 01:39:48.000
badly.

2671
01:39:48.066 --> 01:39:49.533
>> Two juries failed to reach a

2672
01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.700
verdict.

2673
01:39:50.767 --> 01:39:53.033
Now a third jury will try.

2674
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.433
>> Imagine if we did nothing

2675
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:56.934
about this case. and instead of

2676
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.934
the FBI coming to. to Batiste.

2677
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.233
one of these organizations

2678
01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.533
actually came to Batiste and

2679
01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.700
provided him the explosives.

2680
01:40:05.767 --> 01:40:08.533
So. could we ignore it?

2681
01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:09.767
And if we had ignored it. and he

2682
01:40:09.834 --> 01:40:11.834
had blown up a building. he had

2683
01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:13.700
done damage to this building

2684
01:40:13.767 --> 01:40:15.600
you're sitting in right now. and

2685
01:40:15.667 --> 01:40:18.633
people were killed. wouldn't

2686
01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:20.100
you be coming back to us to

2687
01:40:20.166 --> 01:40:20.800
say. "Why didn't you do

2688
01:40:20.867 --> 01:40:21.867
something about it?

2689
01:40:21.934 --> 01:40:23.300
Why did you ignore it?"

2690
01:40:23.367 --> 01:40:24.734
This is the question: do you

2691
01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:25.900
want us to stop them before they

2692
01:40:25.967 --> 01:40:28.033
commit this kind of crime. or.

2693
01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:29.533
or do you want to let it happen

2694
01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:30.800
first?

2695
01:40:30.867 --> 01:40:31.800
>> So the government said.

2696
01:40:31.867 --> 01:40:32.834
"We're gonna give this one last

2697
01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:33.900
try.

2698
01:40:33.967 --> 01:40:35.066
A third time."

2699
01:40:35.133 --> 01:40:37.033
And each time they tried the

2700
01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:39.133
case. the case got smaller. and

2701
01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:42.166
more defined and more focused.

2702
01:40:42.233 --> 01:40:43.600
And even with the third trial.

2703
01:40:43.667 --> 01:40:46.467
they really flailed. because the

2704
01:40:46.533 --> 01:40:48.367
jurors were out for almost 12.

2705
01:40:48.433 --> 01:40:49.867
13 days.

2706
01:40:49.934 --> 01:40:51.133
So. it looked like it was gonna

2707
01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:52.433
be another hung jury.

2708
01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:53.700
>> The jury went out for

2709
01:40:53.767 --> 01:40:55.133
deliberations and there was one

2710
01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:57.133
juror who refused to deliberate.

2711
01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:58.633
She just refused.

2712
01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.533
So. the judge had to excuse that

2713
01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:01.834
juror.

2714
01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:04.834

01:43:31.934 --> 01:43:32.967
For instance. we got them a

2785
01:43:33.033 --> 01:43:34.033
warehouse where we had cameras

2786
01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:36.567
and. and they had a meeting. and

2787
01:43:36.633 --> 01:43:38.700
they swore the oath to Al-Qaeda.

2788
01:43:38.767 --> 01:43:40.433
But we could have delivered them

2789
01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:42.300
a. a load of arms and munitions;

2790
01:43:42.367 --> 01:43:43.900
made the arms and munitions

2791
01:43:43.967 --> 01:43:46.133
inoperable. but delivered them.

2792
01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:47.300
Once they accepted that. we

2793
01:43:47.367 --> 01:43:48.600
could have taken them down with

2794
01:43:48.667 --> 01:43:50.400
the. the munitions in their hand

2795
01:43:50.467 --> 01:43:51.834
and I think that would have been

2796
01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:56.100
far. far more effective.

2797
01:43:56.166 --> 01:43:57.667
But at that time. the bureau was

2798
01:43:57.734 --> 01:44:00.100
so nervous about providing

2799
01:44:00.166 --> 01:44:01.633
potential terrorists with

2800
01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:03.467
weaponry that they just flat-

2801
01:44:03.533 --> 01:44:04.567

2802
01:44:04.633 --> 01:44:05.867

2803
01:44:05.934 --> 01:44:07.033
>> Al-Qaeda didn't know any of

2804
01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:08.967
these individuals.

2805
01:44:09.033 --> 01:44:10.667
They didn't have anybody who

2806
01:44:10.734 --> 01:44:12.734
could have done a full ground

2807
01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:14.467

2808

2810
01:44:18.333 --> 01:44:20.000

2811
01:44:20.066 --> 01:44:21.400
this plot.

2812
01:44:21.467 --> 01:44:22.433
I was hoping that they would

2813
01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:23.867
learn that this case was an

2814
01:44:23.934 --> 01:44:25.367
overreach. they had gone too

2815
01:44:25.433 --> 01:44:27.266

2817
