3
00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:36.164
Friends. rivals...

4
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.560
lend me your eyes and ears.

5
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.927
This is not my story.

6
00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:46.890
This is our story.

7
00:00:49.998 --> 00:00:53.098
A story
about the soul of a city.

8
00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.230
A working-class city.

9
00:00:57.863 --> 00:00:59.593
And its community.

10
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:04.890
Its people. My tribe.

11
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:15.197
Manchester
is a... is an intriguing city.

12
00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:19.993
A city like Manchester

13
00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:22.423
is a special place.

14
00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:24.423
The people celebrate life

15
00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:27.031
against all the odds.

16
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:30.263
No one is more important
than anyone else.

17
00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:32.832
We're all workers.
We're all pulling together here.

18
00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:35.030
Home
of the Industrial Revolution.

19
00:01:35.065 --> 00:01:37.329
Hard work
is in the people's blood.

20
00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:41.430
I think
it's about having humility

21
00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:45.096
and for anything you get out
in life. you have to work hard.

22
00:01:45.132 --> 00:01:48.565
After the war.
they craved for release.

23
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.129
A pastime to unite them.

24
00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:53.591
These people had a tough week.

25
00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:55.691
They had nothing
but their football.

26
00:01:55.727 --> 00:01:58.032
You gotta go out there
and entertain them.

27
00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:02.325
The club's DNA is the
pioneering gene.

28
00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:05.262
You see that in the city. too.

29
00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:07.691
It's had its tough times
and its bad times.

30
00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:11.127
But it's always related
to the community.

31
00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:12.560
There's a certain responsibility

32
00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.724
that came with wearing
the red shirt of Man United.

33
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.932
Every single game
carries importance

34
00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:22.195
for the people
who sit there and watch it.

35
00:02:22.197 --> 00:02:26.162
Your responsibility
is to play for them.

36
00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:28.626
Young players.
academy players. youth.

37
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:32.196
Attractive football.
attacking football

38
00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:35.263
that should bring Mancunians
to Old Trafford.

39
00:02:37.263 --> 00:02:39.623
They're the ones
you're playing for.

40
00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.731
Then the significance
of football

41
00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.692
just becomes so much greater.

42
00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:48.565
United has always
been renowned as a family.

43
00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:50.631
That's what United was.

44
00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:52.362
That's what United is.

45
00:02:54.964 --> 00:02:56.692
The story of hope and fear.

46
00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:59.131
Of delight and despair.

47
00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:01.890
And all in between.

48
00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:10.459
Manchester United

49
00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:14.329
on the verge
of true sporting greatness.

50
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.196
We. players.
are just guardians of the shirt.

51
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.230
Handed down from one
generation to another.

52
00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:36.261
To understand the United Way

53
00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.824
means understanding
the Busby Babes.

54
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.192
The man you are looking at

55
00:03:43.194 --> 00:03:44.490
is a football manager.

56
00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:46.030
There are 91 others of his kind

57
00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:47.824
in the football league
at the moment.

58
00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.527
Yet few would deny
that this one is the greatest.

59
00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:53.196
He's the man who's
the personification of his club

60
00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:56.133
and of all that's good
in the game of football.

61
00:03:56.168 --> 00:03:59.093
Matthew Busby was born to
the pit country of Lanarkshire.

62
00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:00.931
son of an Orbiston miner.

63
00:04:00.967 --> 00:04:02.631
And in that distinctive
Scottish way

64
00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:04.362
was crazy about football.

65
00:04:07.265 --> 00:04:10.161
When Matt Busby came
we were not a successful club

66
00:04:10.197 --> 00:04:11.756
by any stretch
of the imagination.

67
00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:14.296
So he had
a little bit of time to build.

68
00:04:18.528 --> 00:04:20.830
The Busby Babes. they call them.

69
00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:21.943
The harvest of young talent

70
00:04:21.967 --> 00:04:24.428
which attracted
the attention of the world.

71
00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:27.898
The darlings
of British football.

72
00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.395
The public
couldn't have enough of them.

73
00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:33.197
Busby Babes.

74
00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.933
A band of brothers
with the world at their feet.

75
00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:39.031
Duncan Edwards.
signed at 15 years.

76
00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:41.428
Bobby Charlton.
signed at 15 years of age.

77
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.998
Eddie Colman. Geoff Bent.
You go on and on and on.

78
00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:48.459
They were sought out
as schoolboy footballers.

79
00:04:48.494 --> 00:04:50.895
When Matt came
straight after the War.

80
00:04:50.963 --> 00:04:52.356
he put a lot of emphasis

81
00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.062
into young players.

82
00:04:54.097 --> 00:04:56.298
It was
a tremendously happy time.

83
00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:59.862
There were boys that'd come to
this club from leaving school.

84
00:04:59.864 --> 00:05:01.295
We lived with them.

85
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:04.394
They came. we nurtured them.
we watched them.

86
00:05:04.396 --> 00:05:06.394
we looked after them.
they were coached.

87
00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:09.456
We were sort of
all together type of thing.

88
00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:12.865
You become a sort of family.

89
00:05:12.934 --> 00:05:16.197
Under Busby
a philosophy came together.

90
00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.327
The United Way is born.

91
00:05:20.396 --> 00:05:22.129
After the horrors of the War.

92
00:05:22.198 --> 00:05:24.526
people were looking
to rebuild lives.

93
00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:26.898
United come along
with these fresh-face kids.

94
00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:28.757
playing absolutely
wonderful football

95
00:05:28.825 --> 00:05:31.932
and the whole nation
took them to heart.

96
00:05:31.967 --> 00:05:34.263
They admired the football
that they played.

97
00:05:34.298 --> 00:05:37.593
They admired the kind of man
Matt Busby was.

98
00:05:39.332 --> 00:05:42.830
They resonated with so
many people across the country.

99
00:05:42.898 --> 00:05:44.723
Those Busby Babes.

100
00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.631
with their unmatched
post-war record

101
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.394
in cup and league football.

102
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.862
This team
conquered all before them.

103
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.660
And now Europe awaits.

104
00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:58.390
United go into
this match with a 2-1 lead

105
00:05:58.425 --> 00:05:59.427
from the first leg.

106
00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:03.657
Over 50.000 are packed
into this JNA stadium.

107
00:06:03.692 --> 00:06:06.526
We arrived in Belgrade.

108
00:06:06.528 --> 00:06:10.026
It was such a thrill
to see the team lined up

109
00:06:10.095 --> 00:06:12.895
before the kick-off.

110
00:06:12.963 --> 00:06:15.032
I felt so proud of them.

111
00:06:22.464 --> 00:06:25.833
United march on
to the next round.

112
00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:29.033
We set off the following morning

113
00:06:29.068 --> 00:06:33.330
with a scheduled stop in Munich
for a refuelling.

114
00:06:33.332 --> 00:06:37.362
There was quite a lot of snow
on the ground in Munich.

115
00:06:40.168 --> 00:06:46.799
We set off on the third attempt
and one of the crew said.

116
00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:49.923
"Christ. we're not going
to make it."

117
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.791
We hit something.

118
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.428
There was an eerie silence.

119
00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:15.999
I could see
quite a few seats strewn.

120
00:07:17.398 --> 00:07:21.659
People were still strapped
in them. but they were dead.

121
00:07:29.996 --> 00:07:32.657
Harry Gregg. the goalie.

122
00:07:32.692 --> 00:07:36.229
had somehow
got out of the cabin.

123
00:07:36.265 --> 00:07:39.924
Had heard a baby crying
and had rescued it

124
00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:43.923
and he called to me to come
and take it from him.

125
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.327
The team were very modest

126
00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:57.791
and they were
very sound young men.

127
00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:06.065
They never had a chance
to say goodbye.

128
00:08:19.095 --> 00:08:20.890
This tragedy...

129
00:08:22.392 --> 00:08:23.999
touched the everyman.

130
00:08:30.263 --> 00:08:32.031
This is Old Trafford

131
00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:35.000
and today it's the heart
of a mourning city.

132
00:08:35.035 --> 00:08:37.829
Everybody in Manchester.
everybody in Britain nearly

133
00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:40.166
is looking to this ground.

134
00:08:40.235 --> 00:08:43.025
How did you feel when you heard
the news of the crash yesterday?

135
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.330
Very upset. I'm sure it's upset
most of the people around here.

136
00:08:46.332 --> 00:08:49.061
I'm sure it's a great loss
to everybody in Manchester.

137
00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:50.724
Too awful for words. really.

138
00:08:50.726 --> 00:08:53.499
I feel like the loss
of great sportsmen

139
00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:55.364
and terribly upset.

140
00:08:55.366 --> 00:08:57.069
The fact you're not a Manchester
man made no difference?

141
00:08:57.093 --> 00:09:00.230
It makes no difference. They're
a fine team and I'm very sorry.

142
00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:04.457
The one question
that's in everybody's mind is.

143
00:09:04.493 --> 00:09:07.033
how's Matt Busby getting along?

144
00:09:07.035 --> 00:09:09.099
This is the first thing
that the taxi driver asked me

145
00:09:09.101 --> 00:09:12.857
when I got out of the train
at the station just now.

146
00:09:14.631 --> 00:09:17.360
I can remember the matron coming
into the dormitory early evening

147
00:09:17.429 --> 00:09:19.561
and telling me
that the plane had crashed.

148
00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:23.725
I knew Matt very well.
He was a friend of my father's.

149
00:09:25.459 --> 00:09:27.065
I used to call him Uncle Matt.

150
00:09:31.364 --> 00:09:34.164
What would
become of Manchester United?

151
00:09:37.997 --> 00:09:42.065
Eight of your players... gone.

152
00:09:46.626 --> 00:09:48.323
Duncan Edwards killed.

153
00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:50.598
David Pegg killed.

154
00:09:50.633 --> 00:09:52.323
Bill Foulkes injured.

155
00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:54.026
Mark Jones killed.

156
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:55.928
Ray Wood injured.

157
00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.532
Eddie Coleman killed.

158
00:09:58.567 --> 00:10:00.291
John Berry injured.

159
00:10:00.293 --> 00:10:02.389
Roger Byrne killed.

160
00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:04.324
Tommy Taylor killed.

161
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.598
Dennis Viollet injured.

162
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.829
Bill Whelan killed.

163
00:10:08.897 --> 00:10:11.362
And Geoff Bent killed.

164
00:10:13.035 --> 00:10:16.624
And the fact that the club
came back to play a match.

165
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.196
ten or 11 days
after such a tragedy.

166
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:21.663
has never. never ceased
to astound me.

167
00:10:24.068 --> 00:10:27.532
My dad. working
in and around the city.

168
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:29.632
he went to Old Trafford

169
00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:32.495
the first game after Munich.

170
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.528
And people of all football
allegiances. like my dad.

171
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.523
were actually asking. "Can
this club recover from this?"

172
00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:42.098
And wanted the club to recover.

173
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:47.630
We went to the match
in our normal corner

174
00:10:47.699 --> 00:10:49.429
and it was electric.

175
00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:52.828
That's the match with the
programme with no names in it.

176
00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:53.995
And United won.

177
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:59.593
And so for a 12-year-old
football life went on normally.

178
00:11:01.901 --> 00:11:04.329
There was a need for solidarity.

179
00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:07.329
The whole country
was with them in that moment.

180
00:11:10.933 --> 00:11:12.763
To lose all those players.

181
00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:14.494
who he'd known since boys

182
00:11:14.529 --> 00:11:18.490
and had nurtured
and made into English champions

183
00:11:18.525 --> 00:11:20.427
took a huge toll at the time.

184
00:11:20.496 --> 00:11:23.361
And I don't think
he ever recovered from Munich.

185
00:11:23.396 --> 00:11:26.065
We didn't bring Munich up
in front of him.

186
00:11:33.297 --> 00:11:35.890
Mentally.
it was a terrible time.

187
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:41.131
They'd known not to discuss
anything at all at the time.

188
00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:44.895
And all of a sudden.
Jean had said something about.

189
00:11:44.931 --> 00:11:46.529
"Look. this is your life."

190
00:11:46.564 --> 00:11:49.931
"This is something you've got
to do. You've got to face it."

191
00:11:49.966 --> 00:11:52.562
"Er. you've got it
in your mind."

192
00:11:52.598 --> 00:11:56.231
"And these boys probably would
want you to go back and all..."

193
00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.963
All on their lines and
it started a little seed again.

194
00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:02.999
And I got this obsession. again.

195
00:12:03.034 --> 00:12:06.664
that Manchester United
were going to the top.

196
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.565
A tragedy that unifies.

197
00:12:09.634 --> 00:12:11.428
That brings people together.

198
00:12:12.567 --> 00:12:14.593
That makes you stronger.

199
00:12:19.398 --> 00:12:21.998
They were a team
that had been devastated

200
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.523
and people wanted
to see them grow again.

201
00:12:25.558 --> 00:12:27.724
♪ When I look up to the sky

202
00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:32.264
♪ I see your eyes
a funny kind of yellow

203
00:12:32.332 --> 00:12:35.162
How would
they rebuild from this tragedy?

204
00:12:35.198 --> 00:12:38.261
♪ I rush home to bed
I sunk my head

205
00:12:38.263 --> 00:12:40.294
Everyone
that he brought into the club

206
00:12:40.296 --> 00:12:44.061
or came through
from the youth system...

207
00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:46.033
It was like a jigsaw puzzle.

208
00:12:46.068 --> 00:12:50.324
Jimmy Murphy was with him.
His number two was with him.

209
00:12:50.326 --> 00:12:52.726
We gelled. We gelled.

210
00:12:52.761 --> 00:12:55.758
That was the Matt Busby way.
That was the United way.

211
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.531
Manchester is coming alive.

212
00:12:59.566 --> 00:13:02.225
Freedom. Joy.

213
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.099
Anything was possible.

214
00:13:06.168 --> 00:13:09.395
Manchester was very lucky
to have a great mix of players.

215
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.262
Bobby was such a gentleman.

216
00:13:12.298 --> 00:13:15.659
But he was demanding. Bobby.
He was a winner.

217
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.956
And Denis
was a fantastic goal scorer.

218
00:13:21.863 --> 00:13:23.758
Was a finisher.

219
00:13:25.593 --> 00:13:27.598
And then
you. obviously. had George.

220
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.032
who was out of this world.

221
00:13:30.964 --> 00:13:33.558
He had everything. Just sublime.

222
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.598
Charlton. Best. Law.
The trinity.

223
00:13:37.634 --> 00:13:39.597
Best again!

224
00:13:39.599 --> 00:13:41.033
Goal! Superb!

225
00:13:41.068 --> 00:13:45.358
This was football that
made cynics fall in love again.

226
00:13:45.393 --> 00:13:46.393
Best. Charlton.

227
00:13:46.429 --> 00:13:48.895
It's telepathic
between the two of them.

228
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.861
And it's number two!

229
00:13:51.896 --> 00:13:54.432
Oh. what a finish!

230
00:13:55.966 --> 00:13:58.626
♪ You in the sky.

231
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.327
♪ You make me cry. your eyes

00:14:02.362 --> 00:14:05.830
♪ You in the sky.

00:14:05.865 --> 00:14:08.096
♪ You make me cry. your eyes

234
00:14:08.164 --> 00:14:09.857
United have scored!

235
00:14:09.893 --> 00:14:13.490
Busby has masterminded
a quite astonishing rebuild.

236
00:14:13.492 --> 00:14:15.631
Both sporting and spiritually.

237
00:14:15.667 --> 00:14:17.895
Europe beckons once more.

238
00:14:17.897 --> 00:14:19.991
For there lies greatness.

239
00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:23.230
I still want Manchester United
to be the best team in Europe.

240
00:14:23.266 --> 00:14:25.490
The only way they can be
the best team in Europe

241
00:14:25.526 --> 00:14:27.131
is by winning the European Cup.

242
00:14:32.398 --> 00:14:35.962
We knew... Each and everyone
of us knew the task ahead.

243
00:14:35.998 --> 00:14:39.824
reflecting on ten years before.

244
00:14:42.359 --> 00:14:43.828
We had to do it for them.

245
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.394
We've got to win.

246
00:14:46.396 --> 00:14:48.461
Manchester United manager.
Matt Busby.

247
00:14:48.463 --> 00:14:51.394
this moment. stands
on the threshold of a dream.

248
00:14:51.429 --> 00:14:53.557
A dream of leading
the first English club

249
00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:55.659
ever to capture
the European Cup.

250
00:14:56.725 --> 00:14:58.690
It was like the Holy Grail.

251
00:14:58.726 --> 00:15:01.758
Everybody wanted to win it
for Sir Matt.

252
00:15:03.397 --> 00:15:06.428
And. obviously. everybody
that perished at Munich.

253
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:12.657
Benfica frustrating United here.

254
00:15:12.659 --> 00:15:14.262
We didn't play that well.

255
00:15:14.297 --> 00:15:16.664
Eusébio waltzing past defenders

256
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.164
like they aren't there.

257
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.132
Every one of us.
our heads were down.

258
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:24.691
United failing
to find any kind of rhythm.

259
00:15:24.727 --> 00:15:27.664
In life. sometimes
terrible things happen.

260
00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:29.657
and it knocks you down.

261
00:15:29.692 --> 00:15:33.165
And sometimes
it pushes you forth.

262
00:15:33.167 --> 00:15:36.126
Sadler
into Charlton. And it's there!

263
00:15:36.162 --> 00:15:38.064
1-0 to Manchester United.

264
00:15:38.099 --> 00:15:40.062
Lovely header
guided into the bottom corner.

265
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:43.423
Deep down.
each and every one of us.

266
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:47.428
we knew it was for them.

267
00:15:47.497 --> 00:15:49.928
We've nurtured them.
We've watched them.

268
00:15:49.963 --> 00:15:51.995
We've looked after them.

269
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.195
Oh. and three.

270
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.562
You become a sort of family.

271
00:15:56.597 --> 00:16:01.163
Charlton loses
his man. Oh. yes. it's four.

272
00:16:01.165 --> 00:16:03.856
That's the game
and that's the European Cup.

273
00:16:03.892 --> 00:16:07.327
Manchester United
have well and truly done it.

274
00:16:07.362 --> 00:16:10.730
They're finally champions
of Europe.

275
00:16:10.766 --> 00:16:12.427
Matt Busby. this maestro.

276
00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:15.393
has groomed a side
ten years on from disaster

277
00:16:15.429 --> 00:16:17.858
to reach the very pinnacle
of football.

278
00:16:17.927 --> 00:16:22.065
It was unbelievable.
Absolutely incredible.

279
00:16:23.898 --> 00:16:26.096
We've done it. We've done it.

280
00:16:26.165 --> 00:16:28.725
It's took ten years.
but we've done it.

281
00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:33.099
It was a release.

282
00:16:33.135 --> 00:16:39.065
I think it was just everything
that involved going back

283
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.923
to that terrible day.
February 6th. in Munich.

284
00:16:49.525 --> 00:16:52.230
The United Way is established.

285
00:16:58.364 --> 00:17:00.396
The damage
done to his body at Munich.

286
00:17:00.398 --> 00:17:04.697
never mind his mental state.
was quite horrific.

287
00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:06.263
He'd taken a battering.

288
00:17:08.326 --> 00:17:10.131
He'd done his shift.

289
00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:14.131
The Emperor stands down.

290
00:17:15.796 --> 00:17:17.230
What's next?

291
00:17:24.162 --> 00:17:27.659
All dynasties rise and fall.

292
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.890
We hadn't won
the league since 1967.

293
00:17:32.892 --> 00:17:36.498
The season before.
I think we should have won it.

294
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.999
Leeds won it.

295
00:17:39.461 --> 00:17:41.696
And one day.
I was sitting in my office.

296
00:17:41.732 --> 00:17:43.964
and the phone rang

297
00:17:44.033 --> 00:17:49.462
and it was the chief exec
of Leeds United.

298
00:17:49.498 --> 00:17:52.198
I said. "Would you be willing
to sell Eric Cantona?"

299
00:17:52.267 --> 00:17:55.791
Cos I'd read in the newspapers
that Wilkinson and Eric.

300
00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:58.231
there were problems
and there were clashes.

301
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.930
I haven't had a problem
in my football career up to now

302
00:18:01.999 --> 00:18:04.125
with any player
I've worked with.

303
00:18:05.992 --> 00:18:09.558
He reads poetry.
He reads philosophy.

304
00:18:09.626 --> 00:18:13.327
He paints.
Maybe that's different.

305
00:18:13.363 --> 00:18:15.357
He said.
"What do you wanna pay for him?"

306
00:18:15.359 --> 00:18:16.962
I said. "A million."

307
00:18:16.964 --> 00:18:19.994
So. they said. "No. no. 1.5."

308
00:18:19.996 --> 00:18:21.130
"No. no. A million."

309
00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:24.000
And. eventually.
I got him down to the million.

310
00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:26.965
"Can we say it's 1.2
because we'll get slaughtered?"

311
00:18:26.967 --> 00:18:30.029
"The supporters
think the world of him."

312
00:18:30.065 --> 00:18:31.863
I said. "You say
what you like."

313
00:18:31.931 --> 00:18:33.197
Football and Manchester United

314
00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:35.457
have signed the French
international striker.

315
00:18:35.493 --> 00:18:37.258
Eric Cantona. from Leeds United

316
00:18:37.294 --> 00:18:39.857
for fee of £1.2 million.

317
00:18:53.032 --> 00:18:55.532
Well. ladies and gentlemen.

318
00:18:55.568 --> 00:18:56.658
we're pleased to announce

319
00:18:56.693 --> 00:19:00.161
that. we've agreed terms
with Leeds United

320
00:19:00.196 --> 00:19:02.594
for the transfer
of Eric Cantona.

321
00:19:02.629 --> 00:19:06.296
And he's agreed a new
three-and-a-half-year contract.

322
00:19:11.325 --> 00:19:12.857
The stage is mine.

323
00:19:14.566 --> 00:19:16.924
All eyes on me.

324
00:19:16.926 --> 00:19:19.160
The Leeds fans probably today
won't agree with me.

325
00:19:19.229 --> 00:19:20.956
but I think it's a shrewd sale.

326
00:19:22.199 --> 00:19:24.364
Wilkinson's done wonders
for that team.

327
00:19:24.366 --> 00:19:27.391
If he thought it was right for
him to get rid of Eric Cantona.

328
00:19:27.393 --> 00:19:29.297
he's made the right decision.

329
00:19:29.332 --> 00:19:32.928
Eric Cantona is 26 and
he's already had eight clubs.

330
00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:33.995
What does that tell us?

331
00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.829
Cantona doesn't fit the bill.

332
00:19:36.831 --> 00:19:38.195
The only thing I recall is

333
00:19:38.231 --> 00:19:41.657
seeing it on the news
that he'd signed.

334
00:19:41.692 --> 00:19:43.828
In them days
it was. like. rumours

335
00:19:43.863 --> 00:19:45.197
and social media.

336
00:19:45.233 --> 00:19:48.892
Basically. you were
the last to know. the players.

337
00:19:48.927 --> 00:19:53.660
Then I remember my mates going.
"What's this Cantona like?"

338
00:19:53.695 --> 00:19:57.527
I think it was fair to say
we all didn't quite realise

339
00:19:57.563 --> 00:20:01.298
how good he was until
he came and trained with us.

340
00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:05.764
The way he went about his
business on the training ground.

341
00:20:05.799 --> 00:20:07.659
he was a breath of fresh air.

342
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.890
We were all in awe of Eric

343
00:20:09.926 --> 00:20:13.294
from the first moment
he arrived at the club.

344
00:20:13.363 --> 00:20:16.532
Cos he was really
the first foreign star

345
00:20:16.567 --> 00:20:18.230
that came into our club.

346
00:20:20.933 --> 00:20:24.498
To see him
walk about the corridors.

347
00:20:24.566 --> 00:20:25.697
to see him train.

348
00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:27.029
it was one of those moments

349
00:20:27.065 --> 00:20:29.462
where
there's youth team players.

350
00:20:29.497 --> 00:20:34.199
you just sit there in awe
of everything that Eric did.

351
00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:37.429
Eric. of course. had won
the league the year before.

352
00:20:37.464 --> 00:20:41.691
so he had that confidence
where he'd already done it.

353
00:20:41.727 --> 00:20:45.999
It was so huge.
We hadn't won it for 26 years.

354
00:20:48.001 --> 00:20:51.132
We'd found it so hard.
Got close a couple of times.

355
00:20:51.168 --> 00:20:56.858
He'd played a big part in
Leeds's win the previous year.

356
00:20:56.927 --> 00:20:59.997
So that was always in the back
of everybody's minds.

357
00:21:00.032 --> 00:21:03.459
The same narrative
was spoken about

358
00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:05.659
at 26 years.
since they'd won the league.

359
00:21:05.695 --> 00:21:09.129
Every year that went on.
the harder that became.

360
00:21:09.164 --> 00:21:10.965
The players
are always being reminded

361
00:21:10.967 --> 00:21:14.524
that they hadn't won that
for so many years

362
00:21:14.526 --> 00:21:16.830
and you'll never be
as good a team

363
00:21:16.899 --> 00:21:19.230
as past teams that have done it.

364
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.626
It's a big. big job.
It's a demanding job.

365
00:21:31.197 --> 00:21:34.556
And particularly
following Sir Matt.

366
00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:35.810
Who's gonna be the next manager?

367
00:21:35.834 --> 00:21:37.864
You all try
and make speculations

368
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.195
because
it hadn't happened before.

369
00:21:41.263 --> 00:21:43.327
But. I mean.
he was there 25. 26 years.

370
00:21:43.329 --> 00:21:45.899
Well. there were
a series of managers.

371
00:21:45.934 --> 00:21:47.895
as there are
when you're not playing well.

372
00:21:47.931 --> 00:21:50.560
And it didn't really work.

373
00:21:51.725 --> 00:21:54.199
They gave it Wilf McGuiness.

374
00:21:54.267 --> 00:21:58.361
He was young. Wilf.
to take the job at that time.

375
00:21:58.397 --> 00:22:01.496
Frank O'Farrell.
who I really liked.

376
00:22:01.498 --> 00:22:04.290
That was a shame
cos he was a lovely man. Frank.

377
00:22:04.292 --> 00:22:06.065
Who was it after?

378
00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:08.964
Tommy Docherty. yes.

379
00:22:09.033 --> 00:22:11.296
Tommy Doc was the next manager.

380
00:22:13.259 --> 00:22:14.727
Tommy Doc took over

381
00:22:14.762 --> 00:22:18.296
and had a bit of a relegation
scrap on his hands right away.

382
00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:23.799
They were living in the
past. Members of the old team.

383
00:22:23.834 --> 00:22:27.032
Yes.
All the old school had to go.

384
00:22:30.459 --> 00:22:32.465
The end of an era.

385
00:22:32.534 --> 00:22:34.131
The bond is broken.

386
00:22:36.666 --> 00:22:38.395
The family is split.

387
00:22:44.097 --> 00:22:45.832
How do you replace people

388
00:22:45.867 --> 00:22:48.131
like Denis Law
and Bobby Charlton?

389
00:22:51.901 --> 00:22:53.899
Players were leaving.
Players were coming in.

390
00:22:53.901 --> 00:22:55.730
Tommy Docherty
was bringing these people in.

391
00:22:55.765 --> 00:22:56.897
Players were leaving.

392
00:22:57.033 --> 00:22:59.302
It was unbelievable the amount
of players that were coming in

393
00:22:59.326 --> 00:23:00.796
and playing for us.

394
00:23:00.798 --> 00:23:03.166
So you weren't settled.

395
00:23:03.202 --> 00:23:06.099
George Best was thinking he's
carrying the weight of the club

396
00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:08.890
because everybody looked up
to him to do something.

397
00:23:10.893 --> 00:23:13.528
Things weren't
happening on the football field.

398
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.329
We were losing a lot of games.
We weren't scoring goals.

399
00:23:16.364 --> 00:23:19.626
Things were beginning
to happen off the field.

400
00:23:21.468 --> 00:23:22.956
I never saw George.

401
00:23:23.765 --> 00:23:25.892
He was never there.

402
00:23:25.927 --> 00:23:29.198
Maybe his drinking
started getting more regular.

403
00:23:29.234 --> 00:23:32.890
And the press were on his back
following him everywhere.

404
00:23:35.932 --> 00:23:39.456
A free spirit went down.

405
00:23:39.458 --> 00:23:40.997
George was a footballer.

406
00:23:40.999 --> 00:23:43.496
He never wanted
to be a role model.

407
00:23:43.564 --> 00:23:46.624
Manchester United
are bottom of the First Division

408
00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.991
facing the real prospect
of relegation.

409
00:23:50.026 --> 00:23:52.892
Remember people saying. "United
are too good to go down."

410
00:23:52.927 --> 00:23:56.824
I think certainly George Best
felt that was the case.

411
00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.423
I picked him
to play on a Saturday.

412
00:23:59.458 --> 00:24:01.361
About ten to three.

413
00:24:01.363 --> 00:24:03.529
there was knock
on the dressing room door.

414
00:24:03.565 --> 00:24:07.863
I opened it. George was there
with this gorgeous looking lady.

415
00:24:07.931 --> 00:24:09.009
He said. "I've come to play."

416
00:24:09.033 --> 00:24:11.158
I said. "You're in no condition
to play."

417
00:24:11.193 --> 00:24:12.096
Which he wasn't.

418
00:24:12.165 --> 00:24:17.098
He'd been a bit heavy
under the booze.

419
00:24:18.831 --> 00:24:20.262
Besty came in

420
00:24:20.297 --> 00:24:23.725
and I said.
"Everything all right. George?"

421
00:24:23.727 --> 00:24:26.362
"I'm not playing today."
he said and walked out.

422
00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:28.762
That's the last I've seen him
at Old Trafford.

423
00:24:28.798 --> 00:24:31.099
It was a disaster.

424
00:24:31.134 --> 00:24:35.595
Just like that the most human
of heroes is gone.

425
00:24:35.597 --> 00:24:38.896
Gallagher! Oh.
it's looped in and United are...

426
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:41.227
I let in 48 goals.

427
00:24:41.296 --> 00:24:42.660
Does that
not tell you something?

428
00:24:42.729 --> 00:24:46.390
It tells you we weren't playing
the Manchester United way

429
00:24:46.425 --> 00:24:48.196
And we got relegated.

430
00:24:48.231 --> 00:24:50.691
And across to Denis Law. Oh!

431
00:24:50.759 --> 00:24:54.290
Denis Law has scored
for Manchester City.

432
00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:55.466
What an irony.

433
00:24:55.501 --> 00:24:57.291
What a cruel irony.

434
00:24:57.326 --> 00:24:59.063
United are relegated.

435
00:24:59.099 --> 00:25:01.599
United are down
and it's chaos here.

436
00:25:01.634 --> 00:25:03.626
Utter chaos at Old Trafford.

437
00:25:13.067 --> 00:25:15.261
We decided
to stick with the team

438
00:25:15.297 --> 00:25:17.659
and bring in
one or two of the kids.

439
00:25:20.161 --> 00:25:21.227
We had a good young set.

440
00:25:21.295 --> 00:25:23.723
One or two good players
come in through the youth team.

441
00:25:23.792 --> 00:25:25.228
He brought them back

442
00:25:25.263 --> 00:25:26.823
into the top flight
two years ago

443
00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:29.832
and now Tommy Docherty
has won them the FA Cup.

444
00:25:29.867 --> 00:25:31.890
In '77 we won the FA Cup.

445
00:25:31.926 --> 00:25:34.691
but it'd been ten years
since we'd won our trophy.

446
00:25:34.726 --> 00:25:37.924
So. we weren't winning
a lot at the time.

447
00:25:37.959 --> 00:25:42.133
A meeting of the directors
has decided unanimously

448
00:25:42.168 --> 00:25:46.427
that Mr Docherty is in breach
of the terms of his contract

449
00:25:46.429 --> 00:25:49.791
and his engagement
is terminated forthwith.

450
00:25:49.827 --> 00:25:52.997
Tonight's decision
by Manchester United's directors

451
00:25:53.032 --> 00:25:54.829
followed a fortnight
of speculation

452
00:25:54.864 --> 00:25:56.066
about Docherty's future.

453
00:25:56.101 --> 00:25:58.764
That began with the news
that Docherty left his wife

454
00:25:58.799 --> 00:26:00.561
after 27 years of marriage.

455
00:26:00.629 --> 00:26:04.396
for the 31-year-old wife
of the club's physiotherapist.

456
00:26:04.465 --> 00:26:08.398
Not one player in that team
knew what was going on.

457
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.026
No one knew.

458
00:26:10.095 --> 00:26:11.396
Nobody saw it coming

459
00:26:11.431 --> 00:26:14.032
and Tommy Docherty obviously
felt a bit uncomfortable.

460
00:26:14.101 --> 00:26:17.261
He... he not only went off
with somebody's wife.

461
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.131
he went off
with an employee of the club.

462
00:26:20.167 --> 00:26:22.829
Docherty.
manager of United since 1972.

463
00:26:22.865 --> 00:26:23.964
wouldn't talk to reporters

464
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.298
as he waited
for the directors' decision.

465
00:26:26.366 --> 00:26:29.325
They met at the home of Louis
Edwards. the club's chairman.

466
00:26:29.393 --> 00:26:30.439
Among them was Sir Matt Busby.

467
00:26:30.463 --> 00:26:32.326
the former manager.
who flew back from Dublin.

468
00:26:32.395 --> 00:26:34.526
specially
to attend today's meeting.

469
00:26:34.528 --> 00:26:38.165
So Matt wanted it
to be a family. you know.

470
00:26:38.234 --> 00:26:43.326
And that was what people...
thought of Manchester United.

471
00:26:43.362 --> 00:26:45.923
Especially those
who worked in it.

472
00:26:46.897 --> 00:26:47.798
Everyone was involved

473
00:26:47.867 --> 00:26:49.625
and the directors
took their stance

474
00:26:49.694 --> 00:26:52.164
that this can't happen
at Manchester United.

475
00:26:53.626 --> 00:26:57.031
Matt Busby was a hindrance.

476
00:26:57.033 --> 00:27:00.861
It was all down to Busby
that I got the sack.

477
00:27:00.863 --> 00:27:02.724
I was very bitter.

478
00:27:02.726 --> 00:27:06.494
They were the losers.
Manchester United.

479
00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.725
Not me. I wasn't a loser.
They were the losers.

480
00:27:16.166 --> 00:27:19.998
Great managers
rise to the challenge.

481
00:27:20.033 --> 00:27:22.565
They are not afraid
of special players.

482
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.956
They search them out.

483
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.390
Well. I think
he's a Manchester United player.

484
00:27:41.458 --> 00:27:43.528
He's an exciting player.

485
00:27:43.564 --> 00:27:46.523
He's got all the assets
of the top players in the world.

486
00:27:46.558 --> 00:27:48.997
He's come to a big. big club.

487
00:27:49.066 --> 00:27:51.999
I just think they connected.
I just...

488
00:27:52.068 --> 00:27:56.357
They had this understanding
of what was required

489
00:27:56.393 --> 00:27:58.094
at that moment in time.

490
00:27:58.129 --> 00:28:01.032
But I also think the manager

491
00:28:01.034 --> 00:28:04.032
gave him that element
of freedom to perform.

492
00:28:04.068 --> 00:28:07.198
to really show his talents
on a football field.

493
00:28:07.267 --> 00:28:11.826
And everybody else sort of
moulded themselves around that.

494
00:28:11.861 --> 00:28:14.691
It was the first time
you really saw a player

495
00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:17.930
being treated different
for a reason.

496
00:28:17.966 --> 00:28:19.998
That's what makes
a great manager.

497
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.427
He understood that
to get the best out of Eric.

498
00:28:22.496 --> 00:28:25.428
he needed to be treated
in a different way.

499
00:28:26.832 --> 00:28:28.758
I needed to be loved.

500
00:28:30.928 --> 00:28:32.659
To belong.

501
00:28:33.633 --> 00:28:35.956
To be part of a family.

502
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.194
The manager was
very good at managing people.

503
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.064
He knew
who he could have a go at.

504
00:28:42.099 --> 00:28:44.130
He knew who he had
to put his arm round.

505
00:28:44.199 --> 00:28:45.495
He knew who to let
have a little bit of leeway

506
00:28:45.497 --> 00:28:48.393
'cos they expressed themselves
in certain different ways.

507
00:28:48.462 --> 00:28:50.457
Eric was one
that got away with quite a bit

508
00:28:50.492 --> 00:28:51.427
because he was just different.

509
00:28:51.462 --> 00:28:53.929
He was different.
the way he dressed. acted.

510
00:28:53.964 --> 00:28:56.327
the way he portrayed himself.

511
00:28:56.363 --> 00:28:58.198
I think
what the manager looks for

512
00:28:58.267 --> 00:29:01.627
was your character. where
you're from. your background.

513
00:29:01.662 --> 00:29:05.160
To make sure that you're
the right type of character.

514
00:29:05.195 --> 00:29:06.896
Forget the playing side of it.

515
00:29:06.898 --> 00:29:10.297
With Eric it's straightforward.

516
00:29:10.332 --> 00:29:14.263
99 things out 100 are
straightforward with the lad.

517
00:29:14.265 --> 00:29:17.291
He loves his training.
he loves to practise.

518
00:29:17.326 --> 00:29:18.499
he's got great pride.

519
00:29:18.534 --> 00:29:21.494
He's got a short fuse.

520
00:29:21.496 --> 00:29:23.597
People say he's this.
people say he's that.

521
00:29:23.666 --> 00:29:24.896
I'm not interested.

522
00:29:24.932 --> 00:29:26.197
So long as it doesn't interfere

523
00:29:26.266 --> 00:29:29.191
with the running of
Manchester United football club.

524
00:29:29.193 --> 00:29:30.591
And it doesn't.

525
00:29:30.626 --> 00:29:32.698
The thing about Eric

526
00:29:32.733 --> 00:29:33.966
is he's very much his own man.

527
00:29:33.968 --> 00:29:37.561
If you respect him fully.
he gives you everything.

528
00:29:37.596 --> 00:29:40.730
Yeah. he was the boss's
favourite by a country mile.

529
00:29:40.798 --> 00:29:42.858
but it didn't bother us.

530
00:29:42.893 --> 00:29:47.232
There was not one player
that would turn round and say.

531
00:29:47.234 --> 00:29:50.891
"It is a little bit unfair that
he treated Eric differently."

532
00:29:50.893 --> 00:29:53.890
Eric was different. He deserved
to be treated different.

533
00:29:55.264 --> 00:29:57.658
He felt like
a man of the people.

534
00:29:57.694 --> 00:30:01.427
He really did.
Like he belonged to the people.

535
00:30:01.496 --> 00:30:05.663
And nobody could believe
that a man of his talent

536
00:30:05.699 --> 00:30:08.593
was like one of us.

537
00:30:14.434 --> 00:30:16.032
I was an outsider.

538
00:30:20.597 --> 00:30:26.296
But I felt strongly the energy
of this club and this city.

539
00:30:26.365 --> 00:30:31.490
The energy only can come
from the soul of the people.

540
00:30:31.526 --> 00:30:34.865
And from the soul of the place.

541
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.361
I went to places
like The Haçienda.

542
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:43.324
to enjoy the music.
the city. the people.

543
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.756
That was important for me

544
00:30:44.792 --> 00:30:48.931
to absorb the vibe.
to understand it.

545
00:30:48.967 --> 00:30:52.964
In Marseille. growing up.
I felt free.

546
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.593
In Manchester.
I felt that freedom again.

547
00:31:00.059 --> 00:31:03.225
Marseille's a very.
very hard. working-class city.

548
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.731
Same as Manchester.

549
00:31:04.766 --> 00:31:06.764
Marseille's not establishment.

550
00:31:06.833 --> 00:31:08.565
Manchester's not establishment.

551
00:31:08.567 --> 00:31:09.865
That's what Eric was like.

552
00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:12.061
I think he recognises
his background

553
00:31:12.096 --> 00:31:13.262
in the people of Manchester.

554
00:31:13.297 --> 00:31:15.923
Eric found the right place
for himself.

555
00:31:17.434 --> 00:31:20.028
I feel at one

556
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.228
with cities built on defiance.

557
00:31:22.263 --> 00:31:24.824
That stand
on their own two feet.

558
00:31:27.827 --> 00:31:31.957
I remember knowing
Manchester as a real dark place.

559
00:31:31.993 --> 00:31:35.094
The late-'70s. there wasn't
an awful lot to enthuse you

560
00:31:35.163 --> 00:31:38.097
about coming over to Manchester.

561
00:31:38.133 --> 00:31:40.261
You think. somebody
please put the lights on.

562
00:31:40.297 --> 00:31:43.227
Brighten up
the place a little bit.

563
00:31:43.263 --> 00:31:45.127
The late-'70s was a time

564
00:31:45.129 --> 00:31:48.030
when the Northwest suffered.

565
00:31:48.098 --> 00:31:49.562
And that area
around Old Trafford.

566
00:31:49.597 --> 00:31:54.923
I think. was an area of a lot
of dereliction. unemployment.

567
00:31:58.765 --> 00:32:00.396
The starting point

568
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:04.490
was the social breakdown
of the Winter of Discontent

569
00:32:04.492 --> 00:32:07.857
under Mr Callaghan in 1978.

570
00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:12.330
And the Northwest
was particularly badly affected.

571
00:32:12.365 --> 00:32:17.658
The cosy world which we were
told would go on for ever.

572
00:32:17.694 --> 00:32:19.997
where full employment
would be guaranteed

573
00:32:20.065 --> 00:32:23.399
by a stroke
of the chancellor's pen.

574
00:32:23.434 --> 00:32:25.993
cutting taxes.

575
00:32:25.995 --> 00:32:27.390
deficit spending.

576
00:32:27.425 --> 00:32:29.999
that cosy world is gone.

577
00:32:34.865 --> 00:32:38.093
Destitution. demoralisation.

578
00:32:38.162 --> 00:32:41.059
huge levels of unemployment.

579
00:32:41.094 --> 00:32:42.263
Real poverty.

580
00:32:42.298 --> 00:32:46.325
That's. that's what life
was like then. you know.

581
00:32:46.393 --> 00:32:47.865
People's lives weren't great.

582
00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:49.339
Football was
the be all and end all.

583
00:32:49.363 --> 00:32:53.457
And it created
a kind of atmosphere at times

584
00:32:53.493 --> 00:32:56.659
that spilled over into violence.

585
00:32:57.559 --> 00:33:02.664
The game
had become unattractive.

586
00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:04.393
The grounds were dreadful.

587
00:33:04.428 --> 00:33:08.230
The obvious place
for the hooligans.

588
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.930
Manchester United

589
00:33:12.999 --> 00:33:14.393
are banned
from European football

590
00:33:14.462 --> 00:33:16.730
after the fighting
involving their fans

591
00:33:16.765 --> 00:33:17.765
in France last month.

592
00:33:17.826 --> 00:33:19.823
Chelsea supporters were involved

593
00:33:19.858 --> 00:33:22.160
in more fighting
with United supporters.

594
00:33:22.162 --> 00:33:24.132
This time outside Old Trafford.

595
00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:26.494
United have had
to put up with the hooligans

596
00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.393
amongst their supporters
for several years now.

597
00:33:29.395 --> 00:33:32.097
But never before
has the team itself

598
00:33:32.132 --> 00:33:35.230
actually lost a match
because of them.

599
00:33:39.832 --> 00:33:42.057
The beautiful game is broken.

600
00:33:42.092 --> 00:33:43.357
Sullied.

601
00:33:43.392 --> 00:33:45.263
These are testing times.

602
00:33:47.893 --> 00:33:50.495
We hadn't won
the league for a number of years

603
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:54.395
and I just felt that the team
wasn't progressing.

604
00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:59.265
We needed a new manager.

605
00:34:01.159 --> 00:34:05.394
There was just a little bit of
a quibble over the company car.

606
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.931
At the time I'd got
a top-of-the-range Merc.

607
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.833
They offered me.
I think. it was a Rover.

608
00:34:10.868 --> 00:34:13.465
I said. "I've got a dog
called Charlie."

609
00:34:13.501 --> 00:34:15.791
"Let's talk cars."

610
00:34:18.825 --> 00:34:20.858
I really can't stand
the word "pressure"

611
00:34:20.893 --> 00:34:23.924
because I think we look
for self-sympathy in the game.

612
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:29.361
whether it's footballers.
managers. directors. whatever.

613
00:34:29.396 --> 00:34:31.364
He came
with a bit of flamboyancy.

614
00:34:31.399 --> 00:34:35.198
And it was like as if they
were trying to change the image.

615
00:34:35.266 --> 00:34:37.925
Not so much the look of
the club. but the image of it.

616
00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.691
from a point of view of what
was being portrayed to the fans.

617
00:34:40.726 --> 00:34:44.261
Ron saw himself
as first-team manager only.

618
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.161
And I don't think
he got much involved

619
00:34:46.197 --> 00:34:49.164
in a great deal outside of that.

620
00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:52.061
There was still young players
floating around.

621
00:34:52.063 --> 00:34:54.023
but Ron had the cheque book.

622
00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:58.624
There was never a question
of neglecting the youth side.

623
00:34:58.659 --> 00:35:01.391
But we had
to get the first team right.

624
00:35:01.393 --> 00:35:02.473
That was the first priority.

625
00:35:02.497 --> 00:35:05.331
I mean. you can't go around
to the fans and say.

626
00:35:05.366 --> 00:35:08.764
"Hey. we ain't half gonna have
a side in five years' time."

627
00:35:08.766 --> 00:35:09.909
The first thing he said to me.

628
00:35:09.933 --> 00:35:11.657
"We've got
to have Bryan Robson."

629
00:35:11.725 --> 00:35:15.197
Don't worry.
You're buying solid gold.

630
00:35:17.097 --> 00:35:18.799
This is biggest deal

631
00:35:18.834 --> 00:35:20.566
in the history
of English football.

632
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:21.892
What does that mean to you?

633
00:35:21.894 --> 00:35:24.799
Well. I'm proud that something
like that is happening.

634
00:35:24.835 --> 00:35:27.390
but I like
to just get on with the game.

635
00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:29.294
I knew Ron really well

636
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:31.463
and I knew
how he wanted me to play.

637
00:35:31.498 --> 00:35:35.795
I wanted to win things and
I knew I had a far better chance

638
00:35:35.864 --> 00:35:36.865
at Manchester United.

639
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.556
Hurry up. lan.
and let's get ready.

640
00:35:39.558 --> 00:35:40.668
We're working this afternoon.

641
00:35:40.692 --> 00:35:43.795
Got you. He's there now.

642
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.532
The new Emperor.

643
00:35:46.568 --> 00:35:50.857
His new clothes. His way.

644
00:35:54.399 --> 00:35:58.028
Nothing happened on a Friday.
We just played five-a-sides.

645
00:35:58.063 --> 00:35:59.797
And Ron was integral to that.

646
00:35:59.832 --> 00:36:01.496
He loved to join in himself.

647
00:36:02.663 --> 00:36:05.964
Which was a bit unusual
because he couldn't really play.

648
00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:07.995
And they were doing
some crossing.

649
00:36:08.064 --> 00:36:09.957
Ron was again integral to that.

650
00:36:09.992 --> 00:36:12.327
He passed the ball out
from the centre of the pitch.

651
00:36:12.363 --> 00:36:14.565
Get out in the right back
and curl it in

652
00:36:14.601 --> 00:36:15.863
and get on the end of it.

653
00:36:15.932 --> 00:36:17.111
All you have to do is put it in.

654
00:36:17.135 --> 00:36:21.195
Generally wisecrack his way
through the training session.

655
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.999
"Right. lads.
see youse tomorrow."

656
00:36:23.035 --> 00:36:25.858
Er. right. OK what happens now?
Who's playing?

657
00:36:25.893 --> 00:36:29.090
Turned up on a Saturday.
Went to the Midlands Hotel.

658
00:36:29.092 --> 00:36:33.090
Still nothing before the meal.
we thought. "What's happening?"

659
00:36:33.126 --> 00:36:36.863
And then he would open up his
briefcase and I thought. "Yes."

660
00:36:36.898 --> 00:36:38.325
He'll have all the team talks.

661
00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.405
He would pass folders round

662
00:36:39.429 --> 00:36:41.764
and we can see
who we're playing against.

663
00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:43.162
So he lifted up his briefcase.

664
00:36:43.197 --> 00:36:46.797
It was full
of aftershave. hairspray.

665
00:36:46.866 --> 00:36:48.130
Done himself up a bit. and went.

666
00:36:48.132 --> 00:36:50.324
"OK. lads.
this is the way we're playing."

667
00:36:50.359 --> 00:36:51.394
"Two big guys up front."

668
00:36:51.396 --> 00:36:54.094
Bump. diddly. bump.
Winger. da. da. da.

669
00:36:54.129 --> 00:36:55.296
And that was the team talk.

670
00:36:55.365 --> 00:36:58.659
I thought. "No. no.
that's it then." Quite simple.

671
00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:02.763
It was larger than life.

672
00:37:02.832 --> 00:37:03.865
And that was his thing.

673
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.832
Making you feel good
all the time.

674
00:37:05.868 --> 00:37:07.956
Saying things
that make you feel good.

675
00:37:11.465 --> 00:37:15.196
Probably his weaknesses. the
only weakness. I'd say. was...

676
00:37:15.198 --> 00:37:19.626
"You can do what you want
outside football.

677
00:37:19.695 --> 00:37:21.159
as long as you turn up
on a Saturday and play.

678
00:37:21.161 --> 00:37:22.799
Life's too short. really.

679
00:37:22.835 --> 00:37:27.599
Socially.
we all lived reasonably close

680
00:37:27.634 --> 00:37:30.262
to each other in those days.

681
00:37:30.264 --> 00:37:33.390
There was always
captains' team meetings

682
00:37:33.426 --> 00:37:35.230
on Tuesdays or Wednesdays

683
00:37:35.232 --> 00:37:38.331
and Robbo would say.
"Right. it's captains' day."

684
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.690
which meant. basically. you had
to go to the pub and stay there

685
00:37:41.725 --> 00:37:45.065
for as long
as you could bear it.

686
00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:49.799
I'd go into the bars
and just say.

687
00:37:49.868 --> 00:37:51.724
"We're having
a bonding session. gaffer."

688
00:37:51.759 --> 00:37:53.697
"We're going out here.
going out there."

689
00:37:53.732 --> 00:37:57.991
The boss was all for it.

690
00:37:58.027 --> 00:38:01.231
I went out with them
once. when I first got there.

691
00:38:01.233 --> 00:38:03.890
and I ride back in the boot
of Bryan Robson's car.

692
00:38:03.892 --> 00:38:06.060
Whiteside. Robson. McGrath
are the three names

693
00:38:06.096 --> 00:38:08.891
that always get mentioned.

694
00:38:08.927 --> 00:38:12.727
And we did. we did like
to go out and have a few pints.

695
00:38:12.729 --> 00:38:16.456
Well. I say to them boys.
"You were our three best players

696
00:38:16.491 --> 00:38:17.557
week in and week out.

697
00:38:17.592 --> 00:38:20.523
Why didn't you get the rest
of the boys out with you?"

698
00:38:20.558 --> 00:38:21.734
We would have been unbeatable.

699
00:38:21.758 --> 00:38:23.529
Oh. what a strike!

700
00:38:23.564 --> 00:38:26.790
If you can get people
enjoying what they're doing.

701
00:38:26.792 --> 00:38:28.372
then you're gonna get
more out of them.

702
00:38:28.396 --> 00:38:31.030
A big trophy for Big Ron.

703
00:38:31.032 --> 00:38:32.862
We did have a good cup run.

704
00:38:32.931 --> 00:38:35.626
We won it in '83 and '85.

705
00:38:40.065 --> 00:38:42.797
I mean.
it's the biggest cup in Britain

706
00:38:42.833 --> 00:38:44.229
and we've got the best support.

707
00:38:44.264 --> 00:38:46.456
It's the league
that United fans want.

708
00:38:46.492 --> 00:38:48.328
An FA Cup is six matches.

709
00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:50.361
It's not hard.
Any club can win an FA Cup.

710
00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:52.857
It's the league
that's the big one; 42 matches.

711
00:38:52.892 --> 00:38:54.957
FA Cup triumph for Man United.

712
00:38:54.959 --> 00:38:58.891
I got that family
feeling when I was there.

713
00:38:58.926 --> 00:39:01.931
They had a humility about them.
All these guys.

714
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.995
And a friendliness.
And a camaraderie.

715
00:39:05.031 --> 00:39:07.589
But they never excluded anybody.

716
00:39:07.625 --> 00:39:08.898
I think your liver excluded you

717
00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.323
from these parties.
now and then.

718
00:39:10.392 --> 00:39:11.457
It wasn't parties.

719
00:39:11.526 --> 00:39:14.461
It was just going to pubs
and sitting down and drinking.

720
00:39:14.463 --> 00:39:18.131
And that held us back.
There's no doubt about it.

721
00:39:18.133 --> 00:39:22.030
Because I spoke
to Jesper Olsen's fitness coach

722
00:39:22.098 --> 00:39:23.957
and he says.
"Youse are losing players

723
00:39:23.959 --> 00:39:26.731
left. right and centre
of injuries cos of the alcohol."

724
00:39:26.766 --> 00:39:28.359
We were reasonably successful.

725
00:39:28.395 --> 00:39:29.998
We were never
out of the top four.

726
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.962
We qualified for Europe
nearly every year.

727
00:39:32.997 --> 00:39:34.995
We won a couple of FA Cups.

728
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.723
So. we weren't unsuccessful.

729
00:39:37.758 --> 00:39:39.966
but. again.
after four. five years

730
00:39:40.001 --> 00:39:43.099
we weren't looking like
winning the league.

731
00:39:43.168 --> 00:39:45.865
It was still 18
years since we won the league.

732
00:39:45.867 --> 00:39:48.065
Nineteen years
since we won the league.

733
00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:51.890
At that time. Liverpool
were absolutely a machine.

734
00:39:51.926 --> 00:39:55.730
but I did feel that
with the players that we had.

735
00:39:55.732 --> 00:39:57.362
we could win the league.

736
00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.097
Things had gone
a little bit wrong

737
00:40:06.133 --> 00:40:10.229
and I wasn't sure
that we could pull it round.

738
00:40:10.298 --> 00:40:13.731
I just felt a change
was needed at that stage.

739
00:40:13.767 --> 00:40:18.231
We went in training one morning.

740
00:40:18.266 --> 00:40:22.489
My boots aren't out for training
and I get a message.

741
00:40:22.558 --> 00:40:24.890
"Chairman wants to see you."

742
00:40:24.959 --> 00:40:27.166
And Mick Brown says.
"The Chairman wants to see us."

743
00:40:27.201 --> 00:40:31.394
I just remember Mick saying.
"What do you think he wants?"

744
00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:34.063
I said. "Don't ask
for a rise today. Mick."

745
00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:37.024
"I don't think
that's gonna happen."

746
00:40:37.059 --> 00:40:40.928
Manchester United Football Club
sacked their manager.

747
00:40:40.963 --> 00:40:42.362
Ron Atkinson. today

748
00:40:42.397 --> 00:40:46.396
and with him goes his
assistant. Mick Brown.

749
00:40:46.464 --> 00:40:49.126
I actually had no indication
what was gonna happen.

750
00:40:49.128 --> 00:40:50.128
I've come down today

751
00:40:50.195 --> 00:40:53.898
expecting. a nice five-a-side
and what have you.

752
00:40:53.934 --> 00:40:56.230
The Chairman
called for me at 10.30.

753
00:40:56.266 --> 00:40:58.823
They told me. reluctantly.
I felt reluctantly.

754
00:40:58.825 --> 00:41:02.461
that they decided
to dispense with my services

755
00:41:02.463 --> 00:41:04.730
because of the results
over the last few months.

756
00:41:04.766 --> 00:41:08.296
And I accept that totally.

757
00:41:09.193 --> 00:41:10.264
Bump.

758
00:41:10.299 --> 00:41:13.398
We went. "Well. what do
you mean. gone?" "I'm away."

759
00:41:13.467 --> 00:41:14.467
"Right. OK."

760
00:41:14.534 --> 00:41:17.991
So. we just looked at
each other a bit and he went.

761
00:41:17.993 --> 00:41:22.423
"Everybody at my house tonight.
Eight o'clock. party."

762
00:41:22.459 --> 00:41:23.459
And that's what it was.

763
00:41:23.525 --> 00:41:25.265
Round to Ron's for a party.

764
00:41:26.102 --> 00:41:28.999
To celebrate him
getting the sack.

765
00:41:30.831 --> 00:41:32.491
Right. here's Fergie.

766
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.995
There was
only one target for me.

767
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.890
And that was Alex Ferguson.

768
00:41:35.892 --> 00:41:37.836
I knew that if I rang up
Aberdeen at switchboard

769
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.461
and just said it was
Martin Edwards. the Chairman.

770
00:41:40.496 --> 00:41:42.832
and I suddenly wanted
to speak to Alex Ferguson.

771
00:41:42.868 --> 00:41:44.632
then I may not
have been put through.

772
00:41:44.667 --> 00:41:46.898
So we went straight to Mike.

773
00:41:46.933 --> 00:41:49.263
"Hello.
Can I speak to Alex. please?"

774
00:41:50.893 --> 00:41:54.330
I think he was pretending
to be Gordon Strachan's agent.

775
00:41:54.366 --> 00:41:56.997
She said. "Oh. John. how are
you? How are the children?"

776
00:41:57.032 --> 00:41:59.394
And I saw the sweat
was pouring down.

777
00:41:59.396 --> 00:42:01.763
I said. "They're fine.
thank you. Fine."

778
00:42:01.832 --> 00:42:02.997
Can I speak to Alex. please?

779
00:42:03.033 --> 00:42:05.428
She said.
"Sure. I'll put you through."

780
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:08.994
Welcome to Manchester.

781
00:42:13.927 --> 00:42:18.065
Ooh! This is different. lads.
This is seriously different.

782
00:42:19.799 --> 00:42:21.327
"I'm Alex Ferguson."

783
00:42:21.329 --> 00:42:24.166
"I'm manager
of Manchester United now."

784
00:42:24.201 --> 00:42:26.799
"I don't care who you are. I
don't care if you're Whiteside.

785
00:42:26.834 --> 00:42:28.763
Robson. McGrath.
Strachan. Whatever."

786
00:42:28.765 --> 00:42:30.525
He said. "I am the manager

787
00:42:30.561 --> 00:42:32.391
of Manchester United
from this day."

788
00:42:32.426 --> 00:42:33.624
I woke up this morning. Alex.

789
00:42:33.626 --> 00:42:35.330
to read
that you're gonna win the title.

790
00:42:35.399 --> 00:42:39.396
Well. what I've said is that
starting today we have to win.

791
00:42:39.432 --> 00:42:42.262
And we have to start thinking
of winning every game now.

792
00:42:42.297 --> 00:42:45.090
The first
pre-match meal we ever had

793
00:42:45.092 --> 00:42:50.129
he got the waitresses to take
away butter and bring margarine.

794
00:42:50.164 --> 00:42:52.891
He wouldn't allow us
to have salt.

795
00:42:52.926 --> 00:42:55.624
Oh. he was authoritative.
There's no doubt about that.

796
00:42:55.693 --> 00:42:57.764
He was a man in control.
He was the boss.

797
00:42:57.766 --> 00:42:59.463
Yeah. he was more disciplined.

798
00:42:59.499 --> 00:43:04.890
There were more boundaries and
rules that you had to abide by.

799
00:43:07.002 --> 00:43:09.399
The structure
of the club and the scouting.

800
00:43:09.434 --> 00:43:10.294
to the youth team

801
00:43:10.396 --> 00:43:13.127
to the way that everything
was sort of run.

802
00:43:13.196 --> 00:43:15.924
it was all geared to be his way.

803
00:43:15.959 --> 00:43:19.133
And there goes
the final whistle.

804
00:43:19.135 --> 00:43:23.697
Manchester United. one goal
only in the last six games now.

805
00:43:23.733 --> 00:43:26.766
No win in their last six.

806
00:43:26.801 --> 00:43:29.197
The vultures
are already circling.

807
00:43:30.897 --> 00:43:32.956
And the knives are out.

808
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:45.965
The atmosphere
sometimes could be critical.

809
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.032
The media certainly
could be critical.

810
00:43:57.764 --> 00:43:59.099
There were moments

811
00:43:59.134 --> 00:44:02.231
when you thought he was
coming under real pressure.

812
00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.031
I think he knew himself that
he needed to turn it around.

813
00:44:05.067 --> 00:44:08.000
I was just hopeful
that he could turn it round

814
00:44:08.035 --> 00:44:10.890
before we had to make
any decisions to the contrary.

815
00:44:12.265 --> 00:44:14.898
We knew how hard
he was working with the scouts.

816
00:44:14.966 --> 00:44:17.624
we knew the emphasis
he put on youth.

817
00:44:17.659 --> 00:44:19.127
The time and effort
he put into it

818
00:44:19.195 --> 00:44:20.924
was just unbelievable. really.

819
00:44:20.926 --> 00:44:24.426
He was there first thing
in the morning. last to leave.

820
00:44:24.462 --> 00:44:26.294
He's one of those believers.

821
00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:27.701
the more you put in.
you get out.

822
00:44:27.725 --> 00:44:31.791
And it is
that working-class ethic.

823
00:44:32.766 --> 00:44:35.933
Patience. Rare in football.

824
00:44:35.935 --> 00:44:39.098
But a most precious commodity
for a manager.

825
00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.923
I think that Cup run
was the biggest pressure of all.

826
00:44:51.564 --> 00:44:54.599
The media were trying
to build that game up to be

827
00:44:54.634 --> 00:44:56.230
a crucial game for his future.

828
00:45:03.299 --> 00:45:06.356
We just knew. as a group.
that we had to do better.

829
00:45:06.392 --> 00:45:08.990
We had to do more.

830
00:45:09.026 --> 00:45:13.324
We just felt if he
could just get some success

831
00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:14.857
it would all come right.

832
00:45:18.231 --> 00:45:20.060
He was fearless
in what he'd done.

833
00:45:20.096 --> 00:45:21.263
He would just stick by it

834
00:45:21.299 --> 00:45:23.724
and he'd always believe
he could make it work

835
00:45:23.793 --> 00:45:26.323
to suit Manchester United
as a football team

836
00:45:26.392 --> 00:45:27.791
and a football club.

837
00:45:34.768 --> 00:45:36.560
You've gotta win
your domestic title.

838
00:45:36.596 --> 00:45:38.899
That's what you're judged on.
Your competition.

839
00:45:38.934 --> 00:45:41.791
The competition
in your own environment.

840
00:45:43.693 --> 00:45:47.328
And that was always
the. uh. the holy grail.

841
00:45:47.363 --> 00:45:49.031
And the players
are always being reminded

842
00:45:49.033 --> 00:45:52.857
that they hadn't won that
for so many years.

843
00:45:54.066 --> 00:45:56.196
Arch-rivals take to the field

844
00:45:56.232 --> 00:45:59.489
with United still
in this race for the title.

845
00:45:59.558 --> 00:46:01.427
Up until Christmas.

846
00:46:01.462 --> 00:46:04.857
we looked as if
we were odds on favourites.

847
00:46:04.893 --> 00:46:07.361
We. you know. we played
some fantastic football.

848
00:46:07.397 --> 00:46:11.763
And. um. and if we're being
brutally honest.

849
00:46:11.799 --> 00:46:13.494
we. uh. bottled it a bit.

850
00:46:13.529 --> 00:46:16.731
And Walters on the follow-up!

851
00:46:16.767 --> 00:46:18.227
And the title will go to Leeds!

852
00:46:18.229 --> 00:46:19.991
Manchester United have blown it.

853
00:46:20.026 --> 00:46:23.562
We'd handed the opportunity
to Leeds to go on and win it.

854
00:46:23.598 --> 00:46:28.264
It's the most disappointed I'd
ever been. really. in football.

855
00:46:28.299 --> 00:46:31.298
After the game someone asked me
for my autograph.

856
00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.799
And I signed it and they ripped
it up in front of me.

857
00:46:33.835 --> 00:46:35.374
They said.
"You'll never win the league."

858
00:46:35.398 --> 00:46:39.162
Sir Alex used that as a tool
to. um. to make it.

859
00:46:39.231 --> 00:46:42.032
"It's us against the world."
basically.

860
00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:47.456
He made a point of
saying it on the coach.

861
00:46:47.491 --> 00:46:50.199
"This is what happened."

862
00:46:50.201 --> 00:46:54.127
"Next year. we come back. and
we don't let this happen again."

863
00:46:54.162 --> 00:46:55.242
"Right. we'll show people."

864
00:46:55.366 --> 00:46:57.928
"We'll show them what we're
about and what we're gonna do

865
00:46:57.964 --> 00:47:00.228
and we will overcome it."

866
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:02.899
We've got to assemble a squad

867
00:47:02.935 --> 00:47:05.692
which is good enough
to win the Premier League.

868
00:47:08.331 --> 00:47:12.462
We had a great
presence about that team.

869
00:47:12.497 --> 00:47:17.129
And so. that dressing room could
handle a character.

870
00:47:17.165 --> 00:47:20.599
And Eric was definitely
a character.

871
00:47:20.601 --> 00:47:22.626
Manchester United needed me.

872
00:47:24.259 --> 00:47:25.824
And I needed them.

873
00:47:29.198 --> 00:47:33.065
I was an outsider. but...
I was accepted.

874
00:47:34.693 --> 00:47:36.891
I was born to play
for Manchester United.

875
00:47:40.001 --> 00:47:41.990
It's a good cross.
and Cantona...

876
00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:44.731
Beautiful turn on his first goal
for Manchester United.

877
00:47:44.733 --> 00:47:47.297
Eric became a catalyst in a way.

878
00:47:47.332 --> 00:47:50.690
He was different.
He trained differently.

879
00:47:50.726 --> 00:47:52.792
He looked after himself
differently.

880
00:47:52.861 --> 00:47:56.893
As time went on. he just changed
everybody's mentality.

881
00:47:56.928 --> 00:47:59.308
A lot of people say a talisman.
but I think it's more than that.

882
00:47:59.332 --> 00:48:04.124
When we bought Cantona.
everything seemed to kick off.

883
00:48:06.464 --> 00:48:08.865
There was
a different culture at the club.

884
00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.665
You were seeing
these young kids.

885
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.128
like little cats. sneaking up.

886
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:14.133
getting closer and closer
to Eric.

887
00:48:14.135 --> 00:48:18.065
And before we knew it. they
were doing the same as he did.

888
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:21.464
From that point on.
we never really looked back.

889
00:48:22.762 --> 00:48:30.031
♪ Don't waste your words.
I don't need anything from you

890
00:48:30.066 --> 00:48:33.862
♪ I don't care
where you've been or what...

891
00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:35.626
Hughes!

892
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:41.691
We really believed that we could
win the league that year.

893
00:48:41.693 --> 00:48:43.724
The boys had loads of belief
in themselves.

894
00:48:43.792 --> 00:48:46.098
There was a determination
amongst us all.

895
00:48:47.429 --> 00:48:49.960
Cantona picks out Hughes.

896
00:48:50.029 --> 00:48:51.929
And another cracker.

897
00:48:51.965 --> 00:48:54.692
The fans. the culture. the city.

898
00:48:54.727 --> 00:48:57.758
That was the energy
that pushed us forward.

899
00:49:00.529 --> 00:49:03.096
We were taught to be brave.
to take chances...

900
00:49:03.165 --> 00:49:05.461
- Cantona.
- ..be confident.

901
00:49:05.463 --> 00:49:09.032
It's a night where you can relax
and play but win.

902
00:49:09.034 --> 00:49:11.123
It was just there.
you could feel it.

903
00:49:11.192 --> 00:49:15.323
Determination to make sure that
we got over the line this time.

904
00:49:19.897 --> 00:49:20.866
Bruce!

905
00:49:20.901 --> 00:49:23.890
♪ I am the resurrection
and I am the life

906
00:49:26.096 --> 00:49:28.729
Unbelievable!

907
00:49:34.795 --> 00:49:38.824
They've come back
from the dead in this one.

908
00:49:48.564 --> 00:49:54.190
United are Kings of England once
more. Champions. once again.

909
00:49:54.225 --> 00:49:55.932
Champions.

910
00:49:55.934 --> 00:50:02.556
♪ I am the resurrection
and I am the life

911
00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:04.791
♪ I couldn't ever bring myself

912
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:13.329
♪ To hate you as I'd like

913
00:50:18.934 --> 00:50:22.257
We all felt the joy
that we'd brought to Man U

914
00:50:22.325 --> 00:50:23.758
after 26 years.

915
00:50:24.766 --> 00:50:26.031
I can always remember

916
00:50:26.066 --> 00:50:29.291
Sir Matt's smiling face
in the stand.

917
00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:30.691
He was just so delighted

918
00:50:30.727 --> 00:50:33.698
that the club had won it
after so many years.

919
00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:35.127
It was like a weight was lifted

920
00:50:35.129 --> 00:50:37.866
and it really meant everything

921
00:50:37.901 --> 00:50:42.230
to the group of players
and to the city.

922
00:50:48.531 --> 00:50:52.797
Manchester did feel like
the centre of the universe.

923
00:50:52.832 --> 00:50:54.393
You just felt this connection

924
00:50:54.428 --> 00:50:57.032
between the music
and the football.

925
00:50:58.399 --> 00:51:02.532
Old Trafford in the afternoon.
The Haçienda in the night time.

926
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.864
What a perfect weekend.

927
00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.165
The music scene was flying.

928
00:51:06.234 --> 00:51:10.724
We had all the best bands
around the world were all local.

929
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:14.462
Added to that. football.
we were taking off.

930
00:51:14.497 --> 00:51:18.325
Goes for
the chip. and. oh. exquisite!

931
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.923
The city was upbeat.

932
00:51:20.959 --> 00:51:23.393
You realise that something
special is going on.

933
00:51:23.429 --> 00:51:25.229
something's really.
really happening.

934
00:51:25.265 --> 00:51:29.862
Definitely did feel
that the pressure was off.

935
00:51:29.864 --> 00:51:31.066
And the shackles were off.

936
00:51:31.068 --> 00:51:33.298
He's made
an opening. can he finish it?

937
00:51:33.367 --> 00:51:34.266
He can!

938
00:51:34.334 --> 00:51:36.731
Every time we went up
against opposition.

939
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.196
we'd look across and believe

940
00:51:39.232 --> 00:51:41.261
that the opposition
were beaten in the tunnel.

941
00:51:41.296 --> 00:51:44.626
We had that... arrogance.
really.

942
00:51:44.661 --> 00:51:47.224
and that confidence that we were
gonna win games.

943
00:51:50.501 --> 00:51:52.890
We felt unbeatable.

944
00:51:54.725 --> 00:51:56.763
Oh. c'est magnifique!

945
00:51:56.798 --> 00:51:58.593
We felt unstoppable.

946
00:52:00.293 --> 00:52:01.626
Irwin!

947
00:52:04.296 --> 00:52:07.923
Oh! An absolute rocket
from Cantona!

948
00:52:09.666 --> 00:52:11.924
United. champions again.

949
00:52:11.959 --> 00:52:15.725
And this time winners.
of the League and Cup double.

950
00:52:17.397 --> 00:52:21.323
The winner of the PFA
Player of the Year Award

951
00:52:21.358 --> 00:52:24.131
for 1994 is...

952
00:52:25.325 --> 00:52:26.325
Eric Cantona.

953
00:52:29.765 --> 00:52:30.824
Well done.

954
00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.661
You thoroughly deserve that.
Really. well done.

955
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.462
Well done.

956
00:52:36.464 --> 00:52:42.830
I'm very happy and very proud
to get this prize tonight.

957
00:52:42.866 --> 00:52:45.823
And I would like to say. first.

958
00:52:45.859 --> 00:52:50.929
I owe all my success
to Manchester United.

959
00:52:50.931 --> 00:52:54.664
To my manager. Alex Ferguson.

960
00:52:54.699 --> 00:52:56.296
My coach. Brian Kidd.

961
00:52:56.298 --> 00:52:59.931
All my team mates. the staff.
and the fans.

962
00:52:59.967 --> 00:53:03.262
After that I would like.
uh. congratulate

963
00:53:03.297 --> 00:53:06.493
all the people from football
in England.

964
00:53:06.561 --> 00:53:09.091
Even the player
who didn't vote for me.

965
00:53:10.297 --> 00:53:12.723
For... for all the pleasure
they give me

966
00:53:12.792 --> 00:53:14.924
to play in this
magnificent football.

967
00:53:14.926 --> 00:53:17.728
English football. Thank you
very much. to everybody.

968
00:53:40.034 --> 00:53:43.198
Always around that time.
January. Selhurst Park.

969
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.857
They're the.. These are
the games that win you leagues.

970
00:53:51.898 --> 00:53:53.099
We knew it was gonna be tough.

971
00:53:53.101 --> 00:53:56.724
You know. it's blustery.
it's pouring down. it's windy.

972
00:53:56.726 --> 00:54:00.362
Bobbly pitch.
Not great conditions to play in.

973
00:54:01.692 --> 00:54:03.430
Whenever we went away
to away grounds.

974
00:54:03.432 --> 00:54:07.797
you hear the sound of the crowd
and the baying of the crowd.

975
00:54:07.832 --> 00:54:09.461
That was just to-to irritate

976
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:12.065
and try and get a reaction
out of the players.

977
00:54:14.035 --> 00:54:17.297
Some of the abuse that
we used to get was ridiculous.

978
00:54:17.299 --> 00:54:19.664
It's a cold
and windy winter night

979
00:54:19.699 --> 00:54:20.699
here in South London.

980
00:54:20.792 --> 00:54:23.430
This will be a test
of United's credentials.

981
00:54:23.465 --> 00:54:26.096
It was a frustrating game.
Uh. Palace were frustrating us.

982
00:54:26.131 --> 00:54:29.823
We weren't playing
flowing football.

983
00:54:29.892 --> 00:54:32.390
Cantona. strongly dispossessed

984
00:54:32.458 --> 00:54:34.324
and claiming the foul.

985
00:54:34.359 --> 00:54:35.527
But not getting it.

986
00:54:35.563 --> 00:54:40.730
But what you don't see.
for the first 60 minutes.

987
00:54:40.766 --> 00:54:42.493
is Eric getting kicked.

988
00:54:42.561 --> 00:54:45.029
Shaw comes right through him.

989
00:54:45.031 --> 00:54:46.825
You gotta let it
go over your head.

990
00:54:46.827 --> 00:54:50.164
but sometimes it gets a bit much
for you. doesn't it?

991
00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.226
I was injured.

992
00:54:52.261 --> 00:54:55.199
so I was listening to the game
on the radio.

993
00:54:55.234 --> 00:54:59.999
I always felt I could read
when his eyes used to go black.

994
00:55:00.035 --> 00:55:02.990
So when those occasions
occurred. I always felt.

995
00:55:03.059 --> 00:55:06.033
"OK. Eric. don't worry about
it. I'll-I'll sort this guy."

996
00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:09.223
"You go look for space over
there while you calm down."

997
00:55:10.564 --> 00:55:13.999
Cantona gets
to his feet. quite gingerly.

998
00:55:16.228 --> 00:55:18.162
Long clearance from Schmeichel.

999
00:55:18.198 --> 00:55:19.964
And a problem off the ball
immediately.

1000
00:55:19.999 --> 00:55:22.830
Cantona and Shaw
tangle once more.

1001
00:55:22.865 --> 00:55:24.261
And the referee is coming over

1002
00:55:24.297 --> 00:55:26.258
and immediately
shows the red card!

1003
00:55:26.293 --> 00:55:27.459
Cantona is dismissed!

1004
00:55:27.495 --> 00:55:30.162
Where can there be a place
in the game

1005
00:55:30.231 --> 00:55:33.865
for a man of such
extravagant talent?

1006
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.294
A man of such wicked
temperament?

1007
00:55:36.329 --> 00:55:37.924
For the fifth time

1008
00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:43.263
as a Manchester United player.
Eric Cantona is sent off.

1009
00:55:45.231 --> 00:55:47.890
Sir Alex
isn't even looking at him.

1010
00:55:49.099 --> 00:55:51.626
So. I don't know if Eric's
caught. sort of.

1011
00:55:51.661 --> 00:55:54.531
the sight of the manager
not even looking at him.

1012
00:55:54.567 --> 00:55:55.790
and that. sort of.

1013
00:55:55.792 --> 00:55:58.364
added a little bit more fire
in his belly.

1014
00:55:58.399 --> 00:56:01.724
And then it's just. obviously
something's just... switched.

1015
00:56:01.759 --> 00:56:03.363
Dismissed and has now...

1016
00:56:03.398 --> 00:56:07.991
Oh my goodness me! He just
kicked. he's punched a fan!

1017
00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:13.832
Eric Cantona has jumped in and
scissor. kung-fu kicked. a fan!

1018
00:56:13.901 --> 00:56:15.626
Manchester United fans
are coming across!

1019
00:56:15.628 --> 00:56:20.028
I have never seen
as disgraceful incident as that

1020
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:22.065
in all my years in football!

1021
00:56:22.067 --> 00:56:25.159
Eric Cantona should be
thrown out of the game

1022
00:56:25.195 --> 00:56:26.691
for that sort of incident!

1023
00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:30.528
He launched himself
six feet into the crowd

1024
00:56:30.597 --> 00:56:35.027
and kung-fu kicked a supporter
who was eye-witness...

1025
00:56:43.759 --> 00:56:45.763
I have been insulted
thousands of times

1026
00:56:45.765 --> 00:56:47.857
and I have never reacted.

1027
00:56:49.368 --> 00:56:50.758
But sometimes...

1028
00:56:53.632 --> 00:56:55.164
you're fragile.

1029
00:57:04.659 --> 00:57:06.560
I think within
the changing room.

1030
00:57:06.629 --> 00:57:09.231
it was more about the game.
the disappointment.

1031
00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:14.362
but you knew there was something
else that had happened...

1032
00:57:15.793 --> 00:57:17.929
that was at the back
of everyone's mind.

1033
00:57:17.965 --> 00:57:20.956
Uh. back of the manager's mind.

1034
00:57:23.197 --> 00:57:25.329
"How am I gonna
deal with this now?"

1035
00:57:29.068 --> 00:57:31.564
Keep back. please.
Can you keep back.

1036
00:57:36.467 --> 00:57:38.098
Alex!

1037
00:57:51.266 --> 00:57:53.726
The directors of Manchester
United are meeting now

1038
00:57:53.762 --> 00:57:57.395
to discuss the future of their
fallen star. Eric Cantona.

1039
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:59.895
The man promoted
as the greatest player in Europe

1040
00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:00.930
is tonight best known

1041
00:58:01.001 --> 00:58:02.668
for the most outrageous
piece of behaviour

1042
00:58:02.692 --> 00:58:03.976
in the history
of the British game.

1043
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.229
Should Eric Cantona
be banned for life?

1044
00:58:06.264 --> 00:58:08.391
No. he shouldn't.
He's got to be banned

1045
00:58:08.427 --> 00:58:09.525
and he's got to be disciplined.

1046
00:58:09.527 --> 00:58:11.627
But it would
just be such a waste.

1047
00:58:11.663 --> 00:58:14.832
What happened last night
was a stain on our game.

1048
00:58:14.868 --> 00:58:16.473
The Football Association
has this evening

1049
00:58:16.497 --> 00:58:19.561
charged Eric Cantona of
Manchester United and France

1050
00:58:19.597 --> 00:58:22.528
with misconduct that has
brought the game into disrepute.

1051
00:58:22.564 --> 00:58:25.561
Neither explanation
nor apology so far today

1052
00:58:25.597 --> 00:58:28.532
from Eric Cantona. the man who.
this time. it seems.

1053
00:58:28.567 --> 00:58:30.031
has simply gone too far.

1054
00:58:30.033 --> 00:58:32.329
What do you think's
gonna happen?

1055
00:58:39.164 --> 00:58:40.957
Good morning.
ladies and gentlemen.

1056
00:58:40.992 --> 00:58:44.490
Manchester United has today
suspended Eric Cantona

1057
00:58:44.492 --> 00:58:46.658
from all first team matches

1058
00:58:46.693 --> 00:58:50.129
for the remainder
of the 1994/95 season.

1059
00:58:50.198 --> 00:58:52.094
Most Manchester United fans

1060
00:58:52.129 --> 00:58:53.731
will clearly wait for Cantona.

1061
00:58:53.733 --> 00:58:55.430
But will Cantona wait for them?

1062
00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:58.665
When he was similarly punished
in France. he quit the game.

1063
00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:00.757
saying it was all beneath him.

1064
00:59:00.759 --> 00:59:03.896
Eric Cantona should be
suspended forthwith

1065
00:59:03.964 --> 00:59:06.360
from all football activities.

1066
00:59:06.396 --> 00:59:10.496
up to and including
September 1995.

1067
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.730
He has given a statement
to the police.

1068
00:59:15.732 --> 00:59:16.896
he has been charged.

1069
00:59:16.932 --> 00:59:19.528
The charge is of common assault.

1070
00:59:19.564 --> 00:59:22.832
Magistrate Jean
Perch ordered he go to jail.

1071
00:59:22.901 --> 00:59:24.732
Cantona's barrister argued

1072
00:59:24.768 --> 00:59:26.362
that they sent Cantona to prison

1073
00:59:26.364 --> 00:59:28.591
not because of the seriousness
of the offence.

1074
00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:30.895
but because
he was a public figure.

1075
00:59:41.033 --> 00:59:42.661
Stuart. from the gallery.

1076
00:59:42.663 --> 00:59:46.456
I think we're talking about him
almost coming in any moment.

1077
00:59:46.492 --> 00:59:48.263
Yeah. gallery. this is it.

1078
00:59:50.265 --> 00:59:52.329
First of all. I've got
a brief statement in English

1079
00:59:52.398 --> 00:59:55.230
and then Eric Cantona
would like to say a few words.

1080
00:59:57.567 --> 00:59:58.699
Eric Cantona's appeal

1081
00:59:58.735 --> 01:00:02.726
against the custodial sentence
of 14 days was allowed today

1082
01:00:02.762 --> 01:00:07.790
and a community service order
of 120 hours substituted.

1083
01:00:07.859 --> 01:00:10.131
Eric Cantona would like
to say a few words.

1084
01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:15.192
My mind was clear.
this was my time.

1085
01:00:15.227 --> 01:00:17.065
This was my message.

1086
01:00:19.831 --> 01:00:21.329
When the seagulls...

1087
01:00:23.864 --> 01:00:25.296
follow the trawler.

1088
01:00:25.996 --> 01:00:28.295
it's because they think

1089
01:00:28.297 --> 01:00:33.256
sardines will be thrown
into the sea.

1090
01:00:33.291 --> 01:00:34.398
Thank you.

1091
01:00:55.391 --> 01:00:57.663
I don't regret it.

1092
01:00:57.732 --> 01:00:59.658
I have one regret...

1093
01:00:59.727 --> 01:01:02.890
I would have loved to kick him
even harder.

1094
01:01:16.931 --> 01:01:18.956
I was banned for nine months.

1095
01:01:20.798 --> 01:01:22.758
I was very upset and...

1096
01:01:25.128 --> 01:01:27.131
and sad and disappointed.

1097
01:01:29.202 --> 01:01:33.664
They wanted me to be an example.
I didn't want to be an example.

1098
01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.762
I'm just a human being.

1099
01:01:44.132 --> 01:01:46.692
That was
a very difficult summer.

1100
01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:52.131
They'd lost the title
on the last day by a goal.

1101
01:01:54.096 --> 01:01:56.164
They lost the FA Cup final.

1102
01:01:57.197 --> 01:01:59.593
And then some
of the players left.

1103
01:02:00.826 --> 01:02:04.131
How do you let players
like Mark Hughes. Paul Ince

1104
01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.427
and Andrei Kanchelskis.
who. all three of them

1105
01:02:06.462 --> 01:02:08.924
would have been
in every starting eleven.

1106
01:02:08.993 --> 01:02:11.823
Why do you let them go and
don't sign any other players?

1107
01:02:11.858 --> 01:02:15.899
And I asked him this. "Why?"
And he said.

1108
01:02:15.935 --> 01:02:18.496
"If I develop players
through my academy.

1109
01:02:18.531 --> 01:02:21.791
if I don't make room to them.
uh. for them in my first team.

1110
01:02:21.793 --> 01:02:23.997
they will stagnate and it's been
a waste of time."

1111
01:02:24.033 --> 01:02:27.133
If a youth team gives you one
player

1112
01:02:27.168 --> 01:02:30.363
that gets into the first team
each year. that's fantastic.

1113
01:02:30.398 --> 01:02:35.261
But we had. probably.
eight broke into the first team.

1114
01:02:35.329 --> 01:02:36.996
I remember him telling me.

1115
01:02:37.031 --> 01:02:38.566
"I think my lads
are good enough.

1116
01:02:38.601 --> 01:02:40.999
so I'm gonna promote them."

1117
01:02:41.034 --> 01:02:44.061
Beckham. Scholes. Butt.
the Nevilles.

1118
01:02:44.096 --> 01:02:46.099
All Manchester United fans.

1119
01:02:46.101 --> 01:02:48.890
And the Boss kept telling us
about them all the time.

1120
01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:52.324
If they've got the temperament.

1121
01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.694
they've got a good chance.

1122
01:02:53.729 --> 01:02:56.228
There's only one way you're
gonna find out. playing them.

1123
01:02:56.297 --> 01:02:58.492
They're good players. but...

1124
01:02:58.527 --> 01:03:00.997
It was a massive thing.

1125
01:03:01.032 --> 01:03:02.461
I mean. even.
I think. as players.

1126
01:03:02.463 --> 01:03:05.164
you're thinking.
"What are you doing?"

1127
01:03:07.463 --> 01:03:10.690
We'd come through
the youth team.

1128
01:03:10.692 --> 01:03:13.294
We'd come through
the reserve team.

1129
01:03:13.329 --> 01:03:15.999
We were a...
a very close family.

1130
01:03:18.725 --> 01:03:20.298
The players come through
the academy.

1131
01:03:20.334 --> 01:03:24.263
If they are good. they will be
better than any kind of player.

1132
01:03:26.331 --> 01:03:28.962
Because they will have
the soul of the club.

1133
01:03:28.997 --> 01:03:31.496
And the identity of the club.

1134
01:03:31.532 --> 01:03:34.192
Ferguson did what he
thought was right for the team.

1135
01:03:34.228 --> 01:03:35.589
and therefore the club.

1136
01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:37.598
He wanted to build a young team.

1137
01:03:37.633 --> 01:03:40.626
not unlike Matt Busby.

1138
01:03:43.399 --> 01:03:45.990
You could see what he was trying
to do with the youth team

1139
01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:49.429
and especially when he brought
Brian Kidd into the club.

1140
01:03:49.431 --> 01:03:53.725
Get all the best young players
around the Northwest area.

1141
01:03:53.794 --> 01:03:56.664
The emphasis went
more back with development

1142
01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.927
and particularly the. uh.

1143
01:03:58.963 --> 01:04:00.261
local development.

1144
01:04:00.296 --> 01:04:02.757
You know.
the Greater Manchester area.

1145
01:04:02.759 --> 01:04:05.423
Which was my role.
I was given that role.

1146
01:04:05.458 --> 01:04:07.131
local talent. really.

1147
01:04:08.759 --> 01:04:11.066
That's the heritage
at Manchester United.

1148
01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:14.459
You know. and Sir Matt
built teams. like Sir Alex did.

1149
01:04:14.461 --> 01:04:16.896
You know.
they rebuilt teams there.

1150
01:04:16.898 --> 01:04:19.032
That's what he was doing then.

1151
01:04:22.034 --> 01:04:25.830
It's not easily replaced.
these iconic figures.

1152
01:04:25.865 --> 01:04:27.164
Eric Cantona has said he wants

1153
01:04:27.233 --> 01:04:30.297
to leave Manchester United
and English football.

1154
01:04:30.299 --> 01:04:33.566
The FA inquiry into his
appearance in a friendly game

1155
01:04:33.568 --> 01:04:34.923
against Rochdale last month

1156
01:04:34.959 --> 01:04:38.031
appears to have triggered
his request to leave.

1157
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:41.162
I played with the...
with the reserve team.

1158
01:04:41.197 --> 01:04:45.463
We closed all the doors.
and. uh...

1159
01:04:45.531 --> 01:04:49.064
I was not allowed to play with
a shirt of Manchester United.

1160
01:04:49.133 --> 01:04:51.460
So I play with the reserve team.
with that shirt.

1161
01:04:51.496 --> 01:04:54.799
Closed everything.
It was just a friendly game.

1162
01:04:54.835 --> 01:04:57.229
But a journalist
was on the top of the...

1163
01:04:57.231 --> 01:05:00.965
of a tree outside
and he took a picture.

1164
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.999
And. uh. unfortunately.
he didn't fall.

1165
01:05:05.296 --> 01:05:07.098
And the day. after it was
in the paper

1166
01:05:07.133 --> 01:05:10.000
and the FA wanted me...
to ban me even more.

1167
01:05:10.035 --> 01:05:12.132
Tonight. the star
himself is reported

1168
01:05:12.167 --> 01:05:15.066
to be in Paris contemplating
an uncertain future.

1169
01:05:15.135 --> 01:05:17.561
A spokesman for
Manchester United said tonight.

1170
01:05:17.596 --> 01:05:20.396
the board had considered
Cantona's request carefully.

1171
01:05:20.431 --> 01:05:23.362
but had decided they were not
prepared to release him.

1172
01:05:23.431 --> 01:05:25.932
Whether they can keep him here
against his will.

1173
01:05:26.001 --> 01:05:28.799
contract or not.
is another matter all together.

1174
01:05:28.834 --> 01:05:32.489
The siege mentality.
we just. uh...

1175
01:05:32.525 --> 01:05:33.924
we just circled the wagons

1176
01:05:33.926 --> 01:05:38.132
and everybody went inside
and then all stuck together.

1177
01:05:38.168 --> 01:05:40.966
The manager protected players
at our club. you know.

1178
01:05:40.968 --> 01:05:44.561
Because we all know that
when the manager was there

1179
01:05:44.596 --> 01:05:48.957
for the years that he was
and the success that he had.

1180
01:05:48.992 --> 01:05:51.430
it was because when you're
a Manchester United player

1181
01:05:51.465 --> 01:05:54.731
and something goes on in the
club or in your personal life.

1182
01:05:54.766 --> 01:05:58.362
you are treated like family.

1183
01:06:06.801 --> 01:06:08.791
The Boss had gone
to reassure him.

1184
01:06:09.864 --> 01:06:11.395
We was all behind him.

1185
01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.198
He was loved.

1186
01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.163
I had a chat with Eric
yesterday morning.

1187
01:06:19.199 --> 01:06:21.323
I listened to him
and I can understand exactly

1188
01:06:21.358 --> 01:06:22.824
what he's saying.

1189
01:06:24.032 --> 01:06:27.660
He trained so hard
in the pre-season

1190
01:06:27.695 --> 01:06:30.791
and then all of a sudden
it was taken away from him.

1191
01:06:34.492 --> 01:06:36.330
You hear things and...

1192
01:06:36.332 --> 01:06:40.265
gradually you're not seeing
as much as... much of him.

1193
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.627
Um...

1194
01:06:42.663 --> 01:06:46.394
So then you start to wonder.
you know. does he need this?

1195
01:06:46.463 --> 01:06:50.725
You know. Is he gonna go off
somewhere else?

1196
01:06:55.298 --> 01:06:57.228
Many United fans
see Eric Cantona

1197
01:06:57.297 --> 01:07:00.229
as the lynchpin
of Manchester United.

1198
01:07:00.264 --> 01:07:02.999
Do you see him as essential
to United?

1199
01:07:04.831 --> 01:07:06.461
Yeah. I think so.

1200
01:07:08.627 --> 01:07:10.797
In fact. what I-I-I'm probably
weak on

1201
01:07:10.866 --> 01:07:14.362
is. maybe. big game experience.

1202
01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.632
With players like Nicky Butt.
Paul Scholes.

1203
01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:20.529
the two Nevilles. David Beckham.

1204
01:07:20.565 --> 01:07:23.890
Can you win the
title next season if Eric stays?

1205
01:07:23.959 --> 01:07:26.999
Oh. yes.
I'm absolutely certain of that.

1206
01:07:28.725 --> 01:07:32.057
Can you win it if he goes?

1207
01:07:32.059 --> 01:07:35.626
We would have to
get a really good replacement.

1208
01:07:53.463 --> 01:07:57.157
He found
the right words. like always.

1209
01:08:00.001 --> 01:08:04.395
I loved him and I respected him
like a father.

1210
01:08:09.934 --> 01:08:12.923
When a manager does something
like this...

1211
01:08:14.467 --> 01:08:16.495
to his player...

1212
01:08:16.530 --> 01:08:22.194
for sure the player will
give his life to the manager.

1213
01:08:22.196 --> 01:08:25.596
And to the club.
And to the fans.

1214
01:08:25.631 --> 01:08:26.730
Everybody.

1215
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.597
Is he gonna play on Sunday?

1216
01:08:32.632 --> 01:08:35.360
Yes.

1217
01:08:35.396 --> 01:08:37.499
- Definitely.
- From the start?

1218
01:08:37.567 --> 01:08:39.032
Right from the start.

1219
01:08:39.067 --> 01:08:40.865
Welcome the King back in style!

1220
01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:43.063
Get your Eric the King
souvenirs!

1221
01:08:43.098 --> 01:08:46.291
Ooh. aah. ooh. aah. Cantona!

1222
01:08:48.464 --> 01:08:50.898
God is back. he's appearing
at Old Trafford today.

1223
01:08:50.933 --> 01:08:52.523
Miracles don't happen
that often.

1224
01:08:52.525 --> 01:08:53.892
What do you think about today?

1225
01:08:53.927 --> 01:08:56.129
Well. like every football fan
in the country. Martin.

1226
01:08:56.164 --> 01:08:58.097
I'm really excited
about the return

1227
01:08:58.132 --> 01:09:01.725
of the league's
most talented footballer.

1228
01:09:04.596 --> 01:09:08.896
I think it gave us as a club
and the team a real boost

1229
01:09:08.898 --> 01:09:11.092
to have Eric back on the pitch.

1230
01:09:19.063 --> 01:09:20.726
Cantona...

1231
01:09:20.728 --> 01:09:24.364
Puts it away. The script
is written. He's back again.

1232
01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.557
Two-two.

1233
01:09:25.593 --> 01:09:27.063
The fans were behind me.

1234
01:09:27.099 --> 01:09:30.857
The-the-the...
Everybody at the club.

1235
01:09:30.926 --> 01:09:33.791
In some clubs. maybe they
would have sacked me.

1236
01:09:33.826 --> 01:09:37.791
and Manchester United
offered me a new contract.

1237
01:09:37.827 --> 01:09:39.961
That's the difference between
Manchester United

1238
01:09:39.996 --> 01:09:42.429
and the other ones.

1239
01:09:42.464 --> 01:09:44.660
Played across.
Oh. it's flying in.

1240
01:09:44.695 --> 01:09:47.997
And United have closed the gap
at the top of the table.

1241
01:09:48.032 --> 01:09:51.030
This combination
of what was there.

1242
01:09:51.065 --> 01:09:53.498
what came in
and then Eric returning...

1243
01:09:54.825 --> 01:09:58.756
it just made us
an incredible team.

1244
01:09:58.825 --> 01:10:00.360
Footballer of the year.

1245
01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:04.196
He came back
to drag United from nowhere.

1246
01:10:04.264 --> 01:10:06.799
To see Eric back playing.
the excitement.

1247
01:10:06.867 --> 01:10:09.923
It gave us that extra push
that season.

1248
01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.630
James gets there.
just. first... Cantona!

1249
01:10:18.993 --> 01:10:24.295
United have done it. League
and Cup double winners again.

1250
01:10:24.364 --> 01:10:27.862
This double. for me.
means a lot.

1251
01:10:27.897 --> 01:10:30.832
It was a double. uh...

1252
01:10:30.867 --> 01:10:33.290
with a new generation
of players.

1253
01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:40.330
Ferguson thought he
was going to create this empire.

1254
01:10:40.365 --> 01:10:42.825
Cos most people don't think
about creating an empire.

1255
01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.092
they just think about.
"How do I win the next game?"

1256
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:03.659
Good afternoon.
ladies and gentlemen.

1257
01:11:04.966 --> 01:11:06.862
We have asked you
to come along today

1258
01:11:06.898 --> 01:11:08.097
so that we may announce

1259
01:11:08.166 --> 01:11:11.357
that Eric Cantona has indicated
his wish to retire from football

1260
01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:12.956
with immediate effect.

1261
01:11:18.692 --> 01:11:21.198
I didn't see it coming.
personally.

1262
01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.363
Um. and I was devastated when.
when I heard the news.

1263
01:11:25.398 --> 01:11:28.231
I couldn't comprehend how
someone at such a young age.

1264
01:11:28.233 --> 01:11:30.396
with so much talent
would just leave the game and...

1265
01:11:30.398 --> 01:11:33.257
it was sad for us because.
you know. he was our talisman.

1266
01:11:33.293 --> 01:11:34.625
he was our leader.

1267
01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:37.261
It was really difficult
to understand

1268
01:11:37.296 --> 01:11:40.131
as a player and as a team mate.

1269
01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:47.932
But. I think once Eric makes
his mind up. you know.

1270
01:11:47.934 --> 01:11:50.357
he's that type of person
that. you know.

1271
01:11:50.426 --> 01:11:52.758
no one could change that.

1272
01:11:55.065 --> 01:11:57.797
The last game of the league
that season.

1273
01:11:57.799 --> 01:11:59.724
he rented a restaurant locally.

1274
01:11:59.759 --> 01:12:03.556
For me and Jordi and Eric
and our families.

1275
01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:05.898
We had a good time. great night.

1276
01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.890
Celebrated winning the league
again.

1277
01:12:10.066 --> 01:12:11.931
It was two days after.
I listened to the radio

1278
01:12:11.966 --> 01:12:14.130
and it was announced
that he'd retired.

1279
01:12:14.132 --> 01:12:16.490
And he never mentioned
one word to us.

1280
01:12:16.525 --> 01:12:17.958
We were dancing. having fun.

1281
01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.997
Four o'clock in the morning.
we went home and not one word.

1282
01:12:21.066 --> 01:12:24.158
And that was Eric
in a nutshell for you.

1283
01:12:29.996 --> 01:12:31.923
I love the game.

1284
01:12:33.129 --> 01:12:34.966
I love the fire inside of me.

1285
01:12:35.001 --> 01:12:38.823
I love the adrenaline.
I love... I love that.

1286
01:12:38.859 --> 01:12:44.098
I played it as. like a kid.
It was my dream.

1287
01:12:47.901 --> 01:12:51.692
When this dream
became like a routine.

1288
01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:58.556
I don't want to play football
like this.

1289
01:12:58.558 --> 01:13:00.591
I want to be faithful to myself

1290
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:04.658
and to the... to the fans
and everybody.

1291
01:13:04.694 --> 01:13:07.263
And there is so many things
to do in life.

1292
01:13:09.459 --> 01:13:11.428
I don't have time to waste.

1293
01:13:14.464 --> 01:13:18.296
It is time to pass the baton
on to the next generation.

1294
01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.697
My phone rang.

1295
01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:24.890
"David. it's the Boss."

1296
01:13:24.925 --> 01:13:28.926
And I was like. "OK. hi. Boss.
Uh. are you OK?"

1297
01:13:28.961 --> 01:13:31.823
And he said. "Yes. we're. we're
signing. um. Teddy Sheringham."

1298
01:13:31.892 --> 01:13:34.495
"And he's gonna take
the number 10 shirt."

1299
01:13:34.531 --> 01:13:37.496
And I was like. "Boss. I wanna
keep the number 10 shirt."

1300
01:13:37.565 --> 01:13:40.399
"I like wearing the number 10.
I enjoy wearing the number 10."

1301
01:13:40.434 --> 01:13:41.434
"Can I keep it?"

1302
01:13:41.535 --> 01:13:44.860
"Nope. Teddy's having it.
Don't worry about it. son."

1303
01:13:44.862 --> 01:13:46.164
Phone down.

1304
01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.030
I was devastated for the
whole... the whole summer.

1305
01:13:50.032 --> 01:13:52.328
And then I went back
into pre-season

1306
01:13:52.396 --> 01:13:54.196
and the manager pulled me
into his office

1307
01:13:54.231 --> 01:13:56.262
and he was like. um.
"How you feeling?"

1308
01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:58.964
I was like. "Well. you know.
I'm OK. Boss."

1309
01:13:59.033 --> 01:14:01.424
I would never turn round
to him and say.

1310
01:14:01.493 --> 01:14:04.632
I'm-I'm. you know. a bit upset.

1311
01:14:04.667 --> 01:14:06.430
He said. "Oh. by the way. um.

1312
01:14:06.432 --> 01:14:09.857
yeah. you're gonna have the
number seven shirt this year."

1313
01:14:09.926 --> 01:14:12.690
And all of a sudden I went from
being devastated

1314
01:14:12.759 --> 01:14:15.261
to being one of
the happiest people.

1315
01:14:15.297 --> 01:14:17.891
Because. as a United fan.
you grow up

1316
01:14:17.927 --> 01:14:21.124
knowing that that number seven
shirt has been worn by

1317
01:14:21.193 --> 01:14:22.828
George Best.

1318
01:14:22.863 --> 01:14:25.125
Bryan Robson.

1319
01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.626
Eric Cantona.

1320
01:14:28.358 --> 01:14:30.532
As much as I...

1321
01:14:30.568 --> 01:14:32.463
as I was gonna miss Eric.

1322
01:14:32.498 --> 01:14:34.892
I was kind of happy that I had
the number seven shirt.

1323
01:14:34.927 --> 01:14:37.961
And then kind of nervous that
I had to live up to anything

1324
01:14:37.996 --> 01:14:40.329
that he came close to.

1325
01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.929
You join us here
on this parade in North London

1326
01:14:44.964 --> 01:14:46.724
where you can see Arsenal...

1327
01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.830
That year
was a tough year for us.

1328
01:14:48.832 --> 01:14:50.063
It was a really tough year.

1329
01:14:50.131 --> 01:14:52.890
'97-'98 was a.
you know. a fiasco.

1330
01:14:52.959 --> 01:14:56.098
What we were up against
was an incredible team.

1331
01:14:57.564 --> 01:15:01.797
Didn't end up winning anything.
That was a... a major blow.

1332
01:15:01.865 --> 01:15:04.130
Whenever you're not successful

1333
01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:06.995
of winning a league.
winning an FA Cup...

1334
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:09.957
it's always tough at United.

1335
01:15:09.959 --> 01:15:13.994
But that came from. you know.
being a youth team player.

1336
01:15:14.029 --> 01:15:17.027
You know. defeat or...

1337
01:15:17.063 --> 01:15:20.060
having no success hurt.

1338
01:15:20.062 --> 01:15:23.263
It always hurt us. deeply.

1339
01:15:23.298 --> 01:15:26.991
It's together we experience
pain and glory.

1340
01:15:27.026 --> 01:15:28.731
We...

1341
01:15:28.799 --> 01:15:31.923
we fall and rise... together.

1342
01:15:38.162 --> 01:15:39.960
We had to make adjustments.

1343
01:15:39.962 --> 01:15:41.390
We had to change.

1344
01:15:41.459 --> 01:15:42.799
We knew what we had to do.

1345
01:15:42.801 --> 01:15:44.526
We had to
come back stronger and...

1346
01:15:44.528 --> 01:15:47.098
and that's what the manager
prepared us for.

1347
01:15:47.134 --> 01:15:49.561
The manager was a genius
at getting into your head.

1348
01:15:49.597 --> 01:15:52.631
Erm. he made us all believe
that everyone hated us.

1349
01:15:52.667 --> 01:15:54.023
All of the fans hated us.

1350
01:15:54.025 --> 01:15:57.824
He made us believe the referee
didn't like us.

1351
01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:00.858
The mentality. he had us in
like siege mentality.

1352
01:16:00.893 --> 01:16:04.365
"No-one likes you. Everyone
wants to beat Man United."

1353
01:16:04.367 --> 01:16:05.957
Right. OK.

1354
01:16:05.992 --> 01:16:09.131
What he instilled in
his players. week in. week out.

1355
01:16:09.166 --> 01:16:11.427
"You make sure you fight
till the bitter end."

1356
01:16:11.495 --> 01:16:14.132
That is a problem for them.
by the way.

1357
01:16:14.168 --> 01:16:16.965
We get the ball transferred
into these areas there.

1358
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.230
I don't think
they've a chance against us.

1359
01:16:33.296 --> 01:16:35.130
That particular season
epitomises

1360
01:16:35.199 --> 01:16:38.659
how Sir Alex Ferguson
worked as a manager.

1361
01:16:39.926 --> 01:16:41.966
Obviously.
going into that season.

1362
01:16:42.035 --> 01:16:46.757
we'd had the disappointment
of... the season before.

1363
01:16:46.792 --> 01:16:50.197
There was a lot of doubters
out there.

1364
01:16:50.199 --> 01:16:53.525
As a team. I don't think
we wanted to go through

1365
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.330
another season
of disappointment.

1366
01:16:56.365 --> 01:16:59.228
That's a dangerous ball
in and. ah. it's there!

1367
01:16:59.263 --> 01:17:02.197
United with
a last-minute winner.

1368
01:17:02.232 --> 01:17:05.725
I'd never felt like that
playing football before.

1369
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.063
That's when the pressure
was really. really on.

1370
01:17:08.098 --> 01:17:10.698
It was that
little bit different.

1371
01:17:10.734 --> 01:17:11.965
Just that little bit different.

1372
01:17:11.967 --> 01:17:14.523
Two heavyweights go toe-to-toe.

1373
01:17:14.559 --> 01:17:15.930
and the atmosphere is electric.

1374
01:17:15.966 --> 01:17:17.962
Oh. magnificent from
David Beckham!

1375
01:17:17.998 --> 01:17:21.098
Bergkamp strikes from distance!

1376
01:17:22.397 --> 01:17:25.360
It wasn't just a football match.
it was a battle.

1377
01:17:25.395 --> 01:17:26.998
Cynical from Keane.

1378
01:17:27.033 --> 01:17:29.930
And he's off.
The red card for Roy Keane.

1379
01:17:29.965 --> 01:17:33.031
Penalty...
saved by Schmeichel!

1380
01:17:33.067 --> 01:17:36.823
You just felt.
after that semi-final win that.

1381
01:17:36.859 --> 01:17:39.096
yes. there is something
special we can do.

1382
01:17:39.098 --> 01:17:41.792
Giggs... still going.

1383
01:17:41.827 --> 01:17:45.097
And twisting defenders
on the run. Oh. what a finish!

1384
01:17:45.132 --> 01:17:47.698
We played some
of the best football...

1385
01:17:47.733 --> 01:17:49.362
that we'd played in some time.

1386
01:17:50.362 --> 01:17:53.295
We did play
like a team possessed.

1387
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:56.924
The focus on Europe
became more intense.

1388
01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:01.424
I think that was... that was
always our goal... you know.

1389
01:18:01.459 --> 01:18:02.427
to be successful in Europe.

1390
01:18:02.462 --> 01:18:05.833
The manager always
spoke about us as a team.

1391
01:18:05.868 --> 01:18:08.696
as individuals
being successful in Europe.

1392
01:18:12.162 --> 01:18:14.862
Keane! It's 2-2!

1393
01:18:14.897 --> 01:18:17.165
Cole will finish it off.

1394
01:18:17.167 --> 01:18:21.061
Manchester United are in sight
of the European Cup Final.

1395
01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:23.194
Full speed ahead. Barcelona!

1396
01:18:23.196 --> 01:18:24.527
We kept winning. simple as that.

1397
01:18:24.529 --> 01:18:26.405
That's what it's about.
You get in that momentum

1398
01:18:26.429 --> 01:18:28.724
whereby you're winning
week in. week out.

1399
01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.624
It was one of those
superhuman feelings...

1400
01:18:31.626 --> 01:18:33.997
that the whole team
believed that...

1401
01:18:34.032 --> 01:18:35.790
"Nah. this is gonna
be our year."

1402
01:18:35.825 --> 01:18:38.490
And I just felt
that everything that year...

1403
01:18:38.559 --> 01:18:40.765
came down to the last 11 days.

1404
01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.063
We'd done a couple of doubles.

1405
01:18:42.099 --> 01:18:45.032
but nobody had ever done...
a treble.

1406
01:18:46.693 --> 01:18:49.831
Eleven days
to fulfil a collective dream.

1407
01:18:49.867 --> 01:18:50.932
Manchester United

1408
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.362
- on the verge...
- -Just 11 days.

1409
01:18:55.262 --> 01:18:58.127
He's found Cole. Lovely
control.

1410
01:18:58.162 --> 01:19:00.065
Can he lift it over? He has!

1411
01:19:00.101 --> 01:19:03.998
What a finish! It's gone
right to the final whistle

1412
01:19:04.033 --> 01:19:06.295
on the final day
of the league season.

1413
01:19:06.364 --> 01:19:09.956
And Manchester United
have regained their crown.

1414
01:19:11.727 --> 01:19:13.999
I don't think any of us
were tired at that point

1415
01:19:14.034 --> 01:19:17.132
you know. because
we were running on adrenaline.

1416
01:19:17.201 --> 01:19:20.466
Part two of
Manchester United's pilgrimage

1417
01:19:20.501 --> 01:19:21.532
to the promised land.

1418
01:19:21.534 --> 01:19:23.226
Scholes slides it through.

1419
01:19:23.261 --> 01:19:26.362
Sheringham. Oh. what a start!

1420
01:19:32.999 --> 01:19:35.624
Whenever you. er...
had spare time

1421
01:19:35.692 --> 01:19:38.863
or you were ever
just sat at home...

1422
01:19:38.931 --> 01:19:40.426
not letting yourself drift off

1423
01:19:40.462 --> 01:19:43.165
to thinking about
winning the treble.

1424
01:19:43.201 --> 01:19:46.823
That was my like... cos
you could quite easily think...

1425
01:19:46.859 --> 01:19:49.965
"We could do something
unbelievable here."

1426
01:19:50.001 --> 01:19:51.796
We knew it was all leading up

1427
01:19:51.831 --> 01:19:53.529
to that final game.

1428
01:19:53.598 --> 01:19:58.227
We'd never played in. you know.
a Champions League Final before.

1429
01:19:58.263 --> 01:19:59.932
You know. to play
at the Nou Camp.

1430
01:19:59.967 --> 01:20:04.097
to play against...
the mighty Bayern Munich.

1431
01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:07.724
And it was probably
one of the only games...

1432
01:20:07.759 --> 01:20:10.998
in my career
that I was slightly nervous for.

1433
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.791
You just kept thinking
about the game.

1434
01:20:12.826 --> 01:20:15.363
And that was probably
the biggest in my career.

1435
01:20:15.398 --> 01:20:17.797
"Oh. come on. please.
Just get the game over with."

1436
01:20:17.833 --> 01:20:19.329
"I just want to play the game."

1437
01:20:19.365 --> 01:20:22.726
The one game in my life
I can honestly say...

1438
01:20:22.761 --> 01:20:25.028
yeah. I was nervous.
Cos I'd never been here before.

1439
01:20:25.063 --> 01:20:26.659
I was going into the unknown.

1440
01:20:29.692 --> 01:20:31.456
This is our moment...

1441
01:20:31.491 --> 01:20:33.797
to seek out greatness.

1442
01:20:33.832 --> 01:20:36.296
The footballing fates await.

1443
01:20:38.002 --> 01:20:41.690
And then finally.
you're actually there.

1444
01:20:41.725 --> 01:20:44.294
It was like.
"Oh. my... come on."

1445
01:20:44.296 --> 01:20:47.095
"This...
this is a dream come true."

1446
01:20:47.131 --> 01:20:49.295
Who are we?
What are we about?

1447
01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:52.197
How much are we prepared
to invest in this?

1448
01:20:52.199 --> 01:20:55.328
- How far are we prepared to go?

1449
01:20:55.364 --> 01:20:57.791
It's a chance of a lifetime.

1450
01:21:00.826 --> 01:21:03.932
We weren't playing well.
We didn't have that flow.

1451
01:21:03.934 --> 01:21:08.432
We didn't have that fluidity
that... we so...

1452
01:21:08.467 --> 01:21:09.956
we normally have.

1453
01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:14.063
People weren't
doing their jobs right.

1454
01:21:14.098 --> 01:21:16.130
Giggsy weren't
running past people.

1455
01:21:16.165 --> 01:21:17.931
Becks weren't putting
great crossing in.

1456
01:21:17.967 --> 01:21:19.797
Yorke and Coley
weren't linking up.

1457
01:21:19.799 --> 01:21:20.965
I was giving the ball away.

1458
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.290
The back four
were getting beat at the back.

1459
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:31.593
Basler. Oh. deflected it in!

1460
01:21:34.868 --> 01:21:37.030
Sir Alex has come up to me
and he said.

1461
01:21:37.032 --> 01:21:39.295
"Ted. if the score
stays the same.

1462
01:21:39.297 --> 01:21:41.999
if it's still 1-0
after 15. 20 minutes.

1463
01:21:42.034 --> 01:21:44.659
you'll be going on.
So make sure you're ready."

1464
01:21:47.659 --> 01:21:50.961
They hit the bar.
They hit the post.

1465
01:21:50.963 --> 01:21:53.098
They had real chances.

1466
01:21:55.464 --> 01:21:58.357
We've still got a chance.
We can't play any worse.

1467
01:21:58.392 --> 01:21:59.428
We gotta play better.

1468
01:21:59.497 --> 01:22:04.228
We were a team that...
were prepared to take risks...

1469
01:22:04.264 --> 01:22:07.891
er. to gain.
or claw something back.

1470
01:22:07.893 --> 01:22:11.857
I'm ready here. This is what
I've been preparing for.

1471
01:22:14.292 --> 01:22:16.162
Always believe.

1472
01:22:16.231 --> 01:22:18.363
Three added minutes.

1473
01:22:18.365 --> 01:22:21.791
Even though there was only...
three minutes left.

1474
01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:25.956
we knew that... we just
needed that one opportunity.

1475
01:22:30.594 --> 01:22:32.197
In towards Schmeichel.

1476
01:22:34.968 --> 01:22:39.362
That group of players
refused to be beaten.

1477
01:22:39.397 --> 01:22:42.497
Giggs
with the shot. Sheringham!

1478
01:22:50.658 --> 01:22:53.692
From tragedy...
comes triumph.

1479
01:22:54.533 --> 01:22:56.032
From disaster...

1480
01:22:56.764 --> 01:22:58.361
comes glory.

1481
01:22:58.363 --> 01:23:01.060
Beckham. Into Sheringham...

1482
01:23:01.129 --> 01:23:03.362
And Solksjaer has won it!

1483
01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:14.494
Kings of Europe again.

1484
01:23:14.529 --> 01:23:18.061
And nobody will ever win
a European Cup Final

1485
01:23:18.063 --> 01:23:19.824
more dramatically than this.

1486
01:23:33.132 --> 01:23:36.189
This is a story of a community.

1487
01:23:36.191 --> 01:23:37.758
A tribe.

1488
01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:44.263
The years pass.
the tribe evolves.

1489
01:23:46.765 --> 01:23:50.098
Power fades and perishes.

1490
01:23:51.296 --> 01:23:54.532
The empire grows.
the dynasty expands.

1491
01:23:54.601 --> 01:23:57.857
but the soul remains intact.

1492
01:24:02.130 --> 01:24:04.426
What does your tribe
say about you?

1493
01:24:04.495 --> 01:24:08.999
About your heart. Your head.
Your soul.

1494
01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.229
What touched my heart.

1495
01:24:17.231 --> 01:24:20.424
and I'll-I'll never forget
is the scenes...

1496
01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:22.428
when we got back to Manchester.

1497
01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:27.031
We did it... for them.

1498
01:24:27.066 --> 01:24:29.697
Turning into Deansgate
will live with me

1499
01:24:29.732 --> 01:24:31.131
for the rest of my life.

1500
01:24:34.967 --> 01:24:39.959
When... you see
the oceans of people...

1501
01:24:39.994 --> 01:24:43.824
you realise how much it meant
to so many people in Manchester.

1502
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.965
I'd like to think
that in its foundations...

1503
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.824
it is an ordinary club
doing its best.

1504
01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:04.328
Football has that power.

1505
01:25:04.363 --> 01:25:08.890
It has that power
to change people's lives.

1506
01:25:08.925 --> 01:25:11.160
There was many reasons
why Manchester United

1507
01:25:11.195 --> 01:25:12.825
were successful at that time.

1508
01:25:12.827 --> 01:25:16.429
You know. Sir Alex Ferguson.
the manager. the boss...

1509
01:25:16.465 --> 01:25:20.829
bringing the youth team players
through that he did.

1510
01:25:20.865 --> 01:25:23.791
Those players before us...

1511
01:25:23.827 --> 01:25:28.499
you know. to understand
the history. the city.

1512
01:25:28.501 --> 01:25:31.490
The club. the fans.

1513
01:25:31.526 --> 01:25:34.065
To give everything on the pitch.

1514
01:25:35.764 --> 01:25:37.362
And then Eric.

1515
01:25:39.264 --> 01:25:42.165
And when you're
a Manchester United player...

1516
01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.766
there's nothing more
important than being...

1517
01:25:44.801 --> 01:25:47.725
taught by players
like Eric Cantona.

1518
01:25:53.032 --> 01:25:55.031
To understand United
is to understand

1519
01:25:55.033 --> 01:25:59.656
the fundamental aspect
of the human mosaic.

1520
01:25:59.658 --> 01:26:03.126
What thrills us.
What scares us.

1521
01:26:03.162 --> 01:26:05.791
What makes us feel alive.

1522
01:26:59.234 --> 01:27:02.299
Maybe I should wear my collar...
collars up for this interview.

1523
01:27:06.733 --> 01:27:08.427
We had to wear club blazers.

1524
01:27:08.462 --> 01:27:12.258
Eric would turn up
in crushed velvet jackets

1525
01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:13.192
and open-neck shirts.

1526
01:27:13.294 --> 01:27:15.732
while we were all stiff-collared
and club ties.

1527
01:27:15.768 --> 01:27:18.130
If Eric... put on
a black bin bag.

1528
01:27:18.132 --> 01:27:20.295
somehow he would
put something on the bin bag

1529
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:22.195
to make it look
like a designer bin bag.

1530
01:27:22.230 --> 01:27:24.791
We all tried to do
the collar thing.

1531
01:27:24.827 --> 01:27:27.228
and we all thought that
we could get away with it

1532
01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:29.525
but erm. none of us could.
you know?

1533
01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.327
It never looked as good.
It never...

1534
01:27:31.396 --> 01:27:33.865
we always felt like.
that we were...

1535
01:27:33.867 --> 01:27:35.866
copying Eric.
and not in a cool way.

1536
01:27:35.868 --> 01:27:38.565
So. you know.
we tried it in a few games.

1537
01:27:38.634 --> 01:27:40.456
but then it was like. no.

1538
01:27:40.491 --> 01:27:41.665
Just let Eric do that.

1539
01:27:41.701 --> 01:27:43.594
We used to go to the local pub.

1540
01:27:43.630 --> 01:27:46.966
And erm... and of course.
the typical British they are.

1541
01:27:47.035 --> 01:27:50.023
the round was four pints
of Guinness. four lagers.

1542
01:27:50.059 --> 01:27:53.565
five... five pints of bitter.
And. of course. for Eric.

1543
01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.791
a glass of champagne.

1544
01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.995
Everybody's grateful
for what Eric did for the club

1545
01:27:56.997 --> 01:28:00.358
because. even now. what...

1546
01:28:00.394 --> 01:28:03.599
23. 24 years after he's left...

1547
01:28:03.634 --> 01:28:05.097
people still sing his song.

1548
01:28:05.099 --> 01:28:07.096
That's how special
he is to this club.

1549
01:28:07.132 --> 01:28:09.394
He was with us
for five full seasons.

1550
01:28:09.429 --> 01:28:12.928
We won the league
in four of those seasons.

1551
01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:15.489
We did the double twice.

1552
01:28:15.525 --> 01:28:17.725
We... We lost one season.

1553
01:28:19.063 --> 01:28:23.164
While I was banned.

1554
01:28:26.368 --> 01:28:28.626
