00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:18.133
(gentle music)

7
00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:45.000
- Renee. I just happened
upon a window display.

8
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.900
you'll never believe
what is front and center.

9
00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:51.166
so if you had anything to
do with this. thank you.

10
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.266
A European book tour?

11
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.266
For how long?

12
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.934
And when-ish do I leave Seattle?

13
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.233
Good thing I
renewed my passport.

14
00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:05.633
- For those of you
just joining us.

15
00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:07.567
I'm here with my old
friend Ben Livingston.

16
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.333
CEO of Charmed Snowboards.

17
00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.467
which. if you don't know.
are flying off the shelves.

18
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.300
- Demand's been off the charts.

19
00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:16.967
Actually. we outgrew our
local manufacturing space-

20
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.500
- And I hear you're taking
the show on the road.

21
00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:19.533
- Yeah. you might say that.

22
00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:20.900
We're actually preparing to open

23
00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.066
a whole new factory in Asia.

24
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.800
and I'll be living over there
until it's up and running.

25
00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:25.734
- If you ever need
someone to test

26
00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:27.867
a new prototype. I'm around.

27
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.667
- I'll remember that.
(host laughs)

28
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.066
- Don't go anywhere.
we'll be right back.

29
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.467
(Cara sighs)

30
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.667
Thanks for coming. I know this
was a last minute request.

31
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.033
- Please. after I
canceled on you last time.

32
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.467
it's the least I could do.

33
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.400
Thanks.

34
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.400
- A destination wedding in Rome?

35
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.533
That's a valid reason.
- Almost wedding in Rome.

36
00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:47.834
We're still very
happily engaged.

37
00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:50.200
Between my work and the
success of Cara's second book.

38
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.400
scheduling's been tough.

39
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.266
- Sure it wasn't just cold feet?

40
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.867
- Cara. you want
to chime in here?

41
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.033
- Oh!

42
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:57.834
Hello!

43
00:01:57.967 --> 00:01:58.967
- Hi.

44
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.266
- Congrats on your new book.

45
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.633
- Thank you.
- I was just asking

46
00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:03.233
Ben about-
- Our wedding?

47
00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:06.266
Yeah. it's still on.
it's just on hold.

48
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.934
- But not for long.

49
00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:10.100
We're actually about to kick
the planning into high gear.

50
00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:12.233
What do they say. second
time's the charm. right?

51
00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:14.867
(Ben chuckles)

52
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.200
- [Cara] I'll tell
Megan I'm running late.

53
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:17.900
thanks to your
shameless book plug.

54
00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:19.533
- It wasn't shameless.

55
00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:20.934
The whole country
agrees with me.

56
00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:22.567
it's a national bestseller.

57
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.100
- Might be an international one.

58
00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:26.700
Renee's sending me
on a European tour.

59
00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:27.934
it starts in two weeks.

60
00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:29.100
- That's amazing!

61
00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:31.700
- But I'll be gone
for two months.

62
00:02:31.834 --> 00:02:34.133
- Two months. that's
when I leave for Asia.

63
00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:36.133
- We were so close with Rome.

64
00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:37.533
- When am I gonna see you?

65
00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:41.000
- We'll plan rendezvous
here. a few hours there.

66
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.867
- No.

67
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.967
- No?

68
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.567
- Let's say "yes" to each
other before you leave.

69
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.266
No more uncertainty.
no more rumors.

70
00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.233
- Wait. what exactly
are you thinking?

71
00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:54.333
- I think the courthouse
opens at eight.

72
00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:56.934
- You want to get
married tomorrow?

73
00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:59.133
- With our schedules?
The sooner the better.

74
00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:00.266
What do you think?

75
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.367
Could that work?

76
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.633
- Yes!

77
00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:04.533
Yes. yes. yes!

78
00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:08.200
Yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes.

79
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.333
(gentle music)

80
00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:16.700
- I can see your breath.

81
00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:17.700
It must be-

82
00:03:17.834 --> 00:03:18.667
- Cold?

83
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.333
(Megan chuckles)
- I miss that.

84
00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.500
Add it to the list. Please.

85
00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:24.100
- Have I mentioned
how proud I am of you?

86
00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:26.300
- Because of Surgeons Abroad?

87
00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:28.600
Not on this particular call. no.

88
00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:29.934
(Megan chuckles)

89
00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:32.100
- You are literally
living your dreams.

90
00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:34.266
Making a difference where
you're really needed.

91
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.367
- Yeah. and I love
it. I really do.

92
00:03:37.633 --> 00:03:40.533
I just miss you. like a lot.

93
00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:41.834
Like a lot a lot.

94
00:03:41.967 --> 00:03:43.000
Did I ever mentioned that?

95
00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:44.934
- Not on this particular call.

96
00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:47.266
- Okay. I understand.
Miss Executive.

97
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.867
You're they're building
a magazine. which I love.

98
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.967
but you don't have
enough time to miss me?

99
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.967
- Oh. come on. you know I
miss you too. like crazy.

100
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.033
- Hi. Sean.

101
00:03:57.166 --> 00:03:57.834
- Oh.
- Hey!

102
00:03:57.967 --> 00:03:58.934
- Hey!

103
00:03:59.066 --> 00:04:00.900
What's up with that big smile?

104
00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:02.367
- I might be getting married.

105
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.333
- [Megan] Oh. did
you set a date?

106
00:04:03.467 --> 00:04:04.900
- Yup. Tomorrow.

107
00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:05.934
- What?!

108
00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:07.266
- I know. it's a bit nutty. but-

109
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.200
- No. let's do it! Let's do it!

110
00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:10.033
(both laughing)

111
00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:10.900
- Courthouse wedding.

112
00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:12.333
Congratulations.

113
00:04:12.467 --> 00:04:15.166
(Megan chuckles)
- I never said "courthouse."

114
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.033
- I mean. Ben may
have texted me.

115
00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:20.033
Maybe not. but you know.

116
00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:21.700
- Oh. Word travels fast.

117
00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:24.533
Should I get the
three of us a table?

118
00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:26.100
- Oh. no. no. no.

119
00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:28.233
We do not have time to eat. you
need an outfit for tomorrow.

120
00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:29.200
- Oh.
- We gotta go.

121
00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:31.000
- Well. okay.
(Megan chuckles)

122
00:04:31.133 --> 00:04:34.333
(gentle music)

123
00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:36.200
What about...

124
00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:37.200
- That's the one.

125
00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:38.500
It's perfect.

126
00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:40.667
- It's perfect with
my highest heels.

127
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.033
But we're walking
to the courthouse.

128
00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:43.667
- Ah. it's two blocks away.

129
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.867
And you'll be walking on air.

130
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.367
(Megan chuckles)

131
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.000
(Cara sighs)

132
00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:50.000
- Are you sure this
is a good idea?

133
00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:52.200
- Are we still talking
about the shoes?

134
00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:57.100
- Are we rushing this?

135
00:04:57.233 --> 00:04:58.233
I tried calling my dad. but I-

136
00:04:58.367 --> 00:05:00.266
- He'll understand.

137
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.266
He'll be thrilled.

138
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.100
And besides. you guys
can throw a big party

139
00:05:03.233 --> 00:05:04.533
when everyone's back in town.

140
00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:06.633
At the end of the day.

141
00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:08.667
you gotta do what's
best for you and Ben.

142
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.333
- What would I do without you?

143
00:05:13.467 --> 00:05:15.467
- Yeah.
(Cara chuckles)

144
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.734
(Cara chuckles)

145
00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:18.934
I guess an elopement
calls for action shots.

146
00:05:19.066 --> 00:05:20.934
- You guys are a beautiful blur.

147
00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:22.433
You look ridiculously in love.

148
00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:24.266
- Aww. 'Cause we are.

149
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.633
- And we're ridiculously stoked
that in just few minutes.

150
00:05:26.767 --> 00:05:28.667
we're gonna be husband and wife.

151
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.066
(cellphone ringing)
(Megan chuckles)

152
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.066
- Ooh.
(Cara gasps)

153
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.333
- It's my dad.
(camera snaps)

154
00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:34.467
Should I answer? What do I say?

155
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.433
I haven't even told him yet.

156
00:05:36.567 --> 00:05:37.333
- It's up to you.

157
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.333
(Cara sighs)

158
00:05:40.467 --> 00:05:42.367
- He was so excited for Rome.
to walk me down the aisle.

159
00:05:44.367 --> 00:05:46.300
(Cara sighs)

160
00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:47.867
I'm not sure I can do this.

161
00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:50.834
- So then we wait.

162
00:05:53.367 --> 00:05:56.767
Besides. you deserve
your moment. your dress.

163
00:05:57.734 --> 00:05:59.934
- And you deserve to
see me in that dress.

164
00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:02.166
- And I deserve to take you
shopping for that dress.

165
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.000
(both chuckling)

166
00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:06.033
(camera snaps)

167
00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:08.433
(Cara sighs)

168
00:06:11.033 --> 00:06:12.500
- Looks like I've
got you cornered.

169
00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:14.667
That's checkmate. mate.

170
00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:18.667
- It's probably for the best
we're postponing it. right?

171
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.967
For one. I wouldn't feel right

172
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.333
without having you
as my best man.

173
00:06:21.467 --> 00:06:22.400
- Don't wait on me.

174
00:06:22.533 --> 00:06:24.667
Look. one thing
that I have learned

175
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.166
in the field is that
life can't wait.

176
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.033
Just have to do what
you can. when you can.

177
00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:32.233
- Words to live by.

178
00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:34.567
- Words that have running
through my head a lot lately.

179
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.133
- You mean with Megan?

180
00:06:36.266 --> 00:06:38.367
- Dude. she's the one.

181
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.500
I know it. There's
no doubt in my mind.

182
00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:42.400
- So what's stopping
you from proposing?

183
00:06:42.533 --> 00:06:43.333
- What makes you think I don't

184
00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:45.033
already have something
in the works?

185
00:06:45.934 --> 00:06:46.700
- Hm.

186
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.633
- Shh.

187
00:06:48.767 --> 00:06:51.433
(gentle music)

188
00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:56.467
- [Ben] Looks like the pizza's
running even later than I am.

189
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.700
- [Cara] I'd call it a tie.

190
00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:58.567
Thank you.

191
00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.834
- Thanks.

192
00:06:59.967 --> 00:07:02.066
Half jalapeno. half
bacon pineapple?

193
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.400
It's like we're married already.

194
00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:06.033
- I think marriage is a
little more complicated

195
00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:07.600
than knowing each other's
favorite toppings.

196
00:07:07.734 --> 00:07:09.533
- True. also need to
know how to pair them.

197
00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:10.700
Should I get some wine?

198
00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:12.400
- Oh. Tempting. but I shouldn't.

199
00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:14.467
I've been texting
with my book agent.

200
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.533
- Oh. About the tour?

201
00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:16.633
- About breakfast.

202
00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:19.567
Translation: she wants the
scoop on the third book.

203
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.600
- Wow. She never
lets up. does she?

204
00:07:21.734 --> 00:07:22.367
- That's kind of her job.

205
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.400
I just wish I had a better sense

206
00:07:24.533 --> 00:07:27.266
of how the last book in
the trilogy should end.

207
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.767
- It's gonna be your best yet.

208
00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:32.934
- Can I get a slice
of that confidence?

209
00:07:33.066 --> 00:07:33.934
- Actually. yes.

210
00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:35.300
(Cara laughs)
(Ben chuckles)

211
00:07:35.433 --> 00:07:37.100
- Thank you.
- Look. fans are clamoring

212
00:07:37.233 --> 00:07:38.433
for your next book.

213
00:07:38.567 --> 00:07:40.033
If that's not a boost.
I don't know what is.

214
00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:41.533
Now. you want my opinion.

215
00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:43.200
as much as I love your idea

216
00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:45.467
that the detectives share
intel now they're married.

217
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.433
I kinda like that Brad
still hasn't told Greta

218
00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:49.233
he's working deep
cover for the CIA.

219
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.533
- Thanks. I just
wouldn't recommend it
for a real marriage.

220
00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:55.066
- Nonsense.

221
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.700
Little secret here and
there keeps things exciting.

222
00:07:57.834 --> 00:07:59.633
- Think it depends
on the secret.

223
00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:09.834
- Here's to you.

224
00:08:09.967 --> 00:08:13.600
"The Girl Who Lost Her Path"
is out in 12 languages.

225
00:08:13.734 --> 00:08:14.834
- Can you pinch me?

226
00:08:14.967 --> 00:08:16.533
I mean. I've dreamt
of this. but-

227
00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:18.000
- Trust me. you're awake.

228
00:08:18.133 --> 00:08:19.533
Brad and Greta are in love.

229
00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:21.633
but they're also
suspicious of each other.

230
00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:23.767
What reader could put that down?

231
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.834
So. spill.

232
00:08:24.967 --> 00:08:26.467
How do we close out the trilogy?

233
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.600
- Well. I'm not gonna lie.
I've been a bit distracted.

234
00:08:30.734 --> 00:08:35.033
But I have a title: "The
Girl Who Slipped Away."

235
00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:36.533
- Love.

236
00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:38.467
So you must have some idea.

237
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.633
- Well. I'm still debating
whether Brad should come clean

238
00:08:40.767 --> 00:08:42.934
to Greta about his
work in the CIA.

239
00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:45.500
I mean. I would wanna know.

240
00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:48.533
- Readers love mysteries.

241
00:08:48.667 --> 00:08:50.533
I. on the other hand.
like to know exactly

242
00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:52.433
what my writers are up to.

243
00:08:52.567 --> 00:08:54.533
- Well. I can definitely put
some more thought into it.

244
00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:55.967
- You won't have time to sleep

245
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.934
or eat on tour. let alone think.

246
00:08:58.066 --> 00:08:59.333
Can you pitch me something
with a little bit

247
00:08:59.467 --> 00:09:01.233
more meat before you fly out?

248
00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:02.767
How's the 10th?

249
00:09:03.567 --> 00:09:04.900
- The last weekend
before I leave?

250
00:09:05.033 --> 00:09:07.233
I was hoping to spend
a little time with Ben.

251
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.600
But the 10th sounds great.

252
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.767
(Cara sighs)

253
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.767
(elevator bell dings)
(people chattering)

254
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.367
(elevator door opens)

255
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.934
- Sorry.
- No problem.

256
00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:25.100
- [Zoey] Ooh.

257
00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:29.033
(Zoey groans)

258
00:09:29.166 --> 00:09:30.667
- Sure you don't need a hand?

259
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.100
- Does the CEO offer to help
any of the other interns?

260
00:09:33.233 --> 00:09:34.600
I'm not your baby-
- "Baby sister anymore.

261
00:09:34.734 --> 00:09:36.300
I've got this." I know.

262
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.500
(Zoey sighs)

263
00:09:38.633 --> 00:09:41.500
- This was supposed to be
dressing and bacon on the side.

264
00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:43.500
- Okay. well. when you fix that.

265
00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:45.233
you wanna sit in on
my three o'clock?

266
00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:46.433
I'm meeting with the CFO.

267
00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:47.600
- Oh. What for?

268
00:09:47.734 --> 00:09:50.934
- The usual. He'll harass
me to diversify our assets.

269
00:09:51.066 --> 00:09:52.333
- And is that a bad thing?

270
00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:53.633
- Not necessarily.

271
00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:55.500
I think I'd just rather put
the money back in the company.

272
00:09:55.633 --> 00:09:57.000
- Well. that sounds
like a blast.

273
00:09:57.133 --> 00:09:58.867
but I have to do
the coffee run then.

274
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.333
- Okay.
- I want to pay my dues here.

275
00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:03.066
just like everyone else.

276
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.266
And to be honest.
I'm learning a lot.

277
00:10:06.233 --> 00:10:08.600
Like. don't mess up
Frank's nicoise. so...

278
00:10:09.834 --> 00:10:11.266
I better go back
and fix this too.

279
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.200
- Okay.

280
00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:14.333
- Okay.

281
00:10:14.467 --> 00:10:15.633
- Oh. hey. before I forget.

282
00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:18.100
do you have any plans
the weekend of the 9th?

283
00:10:18.233 --> 00:10:19.500
- Like. next weekend?

284
00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:21.600
No. Why?

285
00:10:21.734 --> 00:10:23.567
- Just checking.

286
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.100
(gentle music)

287
00:10:27.567 --> 00:10:29.033
- [Recording] Just a
two-hour drive from Seattle.

288
00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:30.600
our newly remodeled lodge is-

289
00:10:30.734 --> 00:10:31.700
(line clicks)
- Clara Lake.

290
00:10:31.834 --> 00:10:32.900
This is Daniel.
- Oh.

291
00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.667
Hi. I was hoping to speak to
a manager. to book a chalet?

292
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.000
- Well. you've got
one. and I'm on it.

293
00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:40.000
Feels like the whole city
is trying to get up here.

294
00:10:40.133 --> 00:10:41.700
- Oh? Why's that?

295
00:10:41.834 --> 00:10:44.767
- We just got a spring surprise.
14 inches of fresh powder.

296
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.100
- Oh. Great.

297
00:10:46.233 --> 00:10:48.567
Well. is chalet 19
still available?

298
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.834
- Ooh.

299
00:10:49.967 --> 00:10:52.767
Unfortunately. chalet
19 is blocked off.

300
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.200
For a wedding.

301
00:10:54.333 --> 00:10:55.600
- A wedding.
(door opens)

302
00:10:55.734 --> 00:10:56.567
Wow. that's kinda genius.
(door closes)

303
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.200
I never thought of it
as a wedding venue.

304
00:10:58.333 --> 00:10:59.934
- Pretty soon. all
of Seattle will.

305
00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:01.633
once this hits the press.

306
00:11:01.767 --> 00:11:05.133
It's a big mystery writer and
the Charmed Snowboards guy.

307
00:11:05.266 --> 00:11:07.233
Do you know what
the best part is?

308
00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:08.633
They met there.

309
00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:11.133
- That is romantic.

310
00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:12.600
- Right?

311
00:11:12.734 --> 00:11:14.900
Can I interest you in
one of our other chalets?

312
00:11:15.033 --> 00:11:18.100
- No thanks. I
think I'm all set.

313
00:11:18.233 --> 00:11:20.633
(Ben chuckles)

314
00:11:20.767 --> 00:11:23.166
- I was trying to surprise you.

315
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.133
- Mm.
- Which I never can.

316
00:11:25.266 --> 00:11:26.967
I was just looking at
tickets for your dad.

317
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.967
this way. he could
come out on time.

318
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.100
Look. we can push it back
if it's not your speed.

319
00:11:31.233 --> 00:11:32.467
- No. no.

320
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.133
I mean. it's kind of the
best idea ever. I just-

321
00:11:36.266 --> 00:11:37.333
- Wish you'd thought of it?

322
00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:39.767
- I wish we had
thought of it together.

323
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.633
- Yeah. Yeah. I know.

324
00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:43.233
I need to get better
at that. don't I?

325
00:11:43.367 --> 00:11:44.967
Look. I know that 10
days isn't enough time

326
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.400
to plan a birthday party.

327
00:11:47.533 --> 00:11:49.400
but we could hire a
wedding planner...

328
00:11:49.533 --> 00:11:52.500
- Hold on. I think I know
someone who might want the gig.

329
00:11:55.133 --> 00:11:57.166
- Of course I will
plan your wedding!

330
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.834
Oh. I'm so happy you asked me!

331
00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:02.734
So. when is it?
(pen clicking)

332
00:12:02.867 --> 00:12:03.834
- Next weekend.

333
00:12:03.967 --> 00:12:05.033
- Next weekend?

334
00:12:05.166 --> 00:12:05.834
- I know...

335
00:12:05.967 --> 00:12:06.734
- Okay. No worries. no worries.

336
00:12:06.867 --> 00:12:09.000
We will get it done.

337
00:12:09.133 --> 00:12:11.533
Actually. it'll be
a nice distraction.

338
00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:12.400
- From work?

339
00:12:12.533 --> 00:12:13.367
- No.

340
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.667
Sean.

341
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.233
Like. I was literally
just looking up

342
00:12:16.367 --> 00:12:18.834
Hayden Layne's policy
on working remotely.

343
00:12:18.967 --> 00:12:21.734
- Oh. do I detect a relocation
in the works. Megan?

344
00:12:21.867 --> 00:12:23.200
- No. no.

345
00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:27.066
I just wanna be ready
if the day ever comes.

346
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.467
- And what's the policy
with Surgeons Abroad?

347
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.400
- Spouses only.

348
00:12:30.533 --> 00:12:31.867
- Mm. Shoot.

349
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.800
- Which is why.
for the next week.

350
00:12:33.934 --> 00:12:35.967
I'm going to immerse
myself in making

351
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.700
your special day
the best day ever.

352
00:12:38.834 --> 00:12:41.066
So. where is the venue?

353
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.934
- Clara Lake.

354
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.667
- Of course!

355
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.500
Cara. it's perfect.

356
00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:47.734
It's your spot.

357
00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:50.066
- No. it's our spot.
all four of us.

358
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.066
Even if Sean can't be
there. he's still there.

359
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.633
And I can't do it
without my maid of honor.

360
00:12:55.767 --> 00:12:58.667
(gentle music)

361
00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.734
- [Megan] So. cedar.

362
00:12:59.867 --> 00:13:00.700
- [Cara] Mm-hm.

363
00:13:00.834 --> 00:13:03.200
- Pine. eucalyptus.

364
00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:05.700
- Wow. I'm not sure I
know the difference.

365
00:13:05.834 --> 00:13:07.266
- That's why you have me.

366
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.867
- Did I miss the memo that
you went foraging for greens?

367
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.533
- Laugh it up. but my
magazine ran a piece that said

368
00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:16.200
"green and woods
are the new floral."

369
00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:18.767
Allow me to convince you.

370
00:13:19.834 --> 00:13:21.433
- With your wizard's staff?

371
00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:22.767
- Yes. with my wizard's staff.

372
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.934
(both laughing)

373
00:13:24.066 --> 00:13:27.300
Okay. so. hold this.
- Uh-huh.

374
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.800
- And this.
- Okay.

375
00:13:31.767 --> 00:13:33.700
- We're gonna do a little...

376
00:13:33.834 --> 00:13:38.433
Now. imagine it
covered in tea lights.

377
00:13:39.867 --> 00:13:40.900
- I love it.

378
00:13:41.033 --> 00:13:42.367
- Yeah?

379
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.900
- I'm just glad one
of us has a vision.

380
00:13:44.033 --> 00:13:45.934
(both laughing)

381
00:13:46.066 --> 00:13:48.033
Are you gonna have enough
time to pull this off?

382
00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:49.967
- Yeah. I mean. it'll
take some prep work.

383
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.300
but we're getting
up there early.

384
00:13:51.433 --> 00:13:53.734
I mean. what else is
there to do. right?

385
00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:55.800
- Snowboard. fondue.

386
00:13:55.934 --> 00:13:58.867
Oh. and Renee wants me
to pitch my third book.

387
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.633
- On your wedding weekend?

388
00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:01.834
- I didn't know that
when I agreed to it.

389
00:14:01.967 --> 00:14:04.967
- Well. you will get it done

390
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.266
because I will
pick up the slack.

391
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.934
Giving you the most incredible
wedding is my top priority.

392
00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:13.533
(gentle music)

393
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.600
- Getting ready for
the all-hands meeting?

394
00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:22.800
- Yeah. we had a few more
hands than anticipated.

395
00:14:22.934 --> 00:14:25.367
- So would now be a
bad time to tell you

396
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.633
my wedding's back on the books?

397
00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:28.800
- Stop.

398
00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:31.800
Wait. is that why you were
asking me about next weekend?

399
00:14:31.934 --> 00:14:32.800
Oh. you Secret Squirrel!

400
00:14:32.934 --> 00:14:34.767
I should've known you
were up to something!

401
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.100
- Keep it down. okay?

402
00:14:36.233 --> 00:14:37.767
People don't know that
nickname around here.

403
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.600
- Well. I do. And there's
more where that came from.

404
00:14:39.734 --> 00:14:41.433
I've known you my whole life.

405
00:14:41.567 --> 00:14:45.800
- Right. which is why I have
a slightly unorthodox request.

406
00:14:47.166 --> 00:14:49.100
Would you be my best woman?

407
00:14:49.233 --> 00:14:51.367
Sean can't make it back. and...

408
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.033
- Wait. Mom. can she get
back here from Australia?

409
00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:57.433
- Mom's given her blessing. on
the condition you represent.

410
00:14:57.567 --> 00:15:00.767
She wants you up there
with me. and so do I.

411
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.033
And I know that
Dad would've too.

412
00:15:03.166 --> 00:15:04.934
- Of course I'll
be your best woman.

413
00:15:05.066 --> 00:15:05.967
It's an honor.

414
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.000
I mean. not to be confused
with maid of honor.

415
00:15:09.133 --> 00:15:10.166
- That's Megan.

416
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.000
Cara's best friend?

417
00:15:12.133 --> 00:15:13.567
- Yes. Yes.

418
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.400
You guys all met when
I was in college.

419
00:15:15.533 --> 00:15:17.400
and it's a bit of a learning
curve with the names.

420
00:15:17.533 --> 00:15:19.000
- You know. she and
Cara are looking

421
00:15:19.133 --> 00:15:20.333
at dresses this afternoon.

422
00:15:20.467 --> 00:15:22.266
Might be nice for you
to get to know them.

423
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.900
- Oh. this afternoon. I
mean. what have I got?

424
00:15:26.033 --> 00:15:26.900
- The lunch order?

425
00:15:27.033 --> 00:15:28.233
- Yeah. Consider me there.

426
00:15:28.367 --> 00:15:30.934
(both laughing)

427
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.033
- [Megan] Thanks for
all your help. Zoey.

428
00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:39.000
- Thanks for having
me. This is so fun.

429
00:15:39.133 --> 00:15:40.367
And a bit intense.

430
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.667
- Oh. not to fear. I
know a bridal salon

431
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.066
like the back of my hand.

432
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.533
Ooh. Cara.

433
00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:47.333
I like this for
you. the Aria gown.

434
00:15:47.467 --> 00:15:49.367
- And you have to
try on the Bella.

435
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.533
- Why do they all
have princess names?

436
00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:54.433
I mean. the colors.
moonstone. moonflower.

437
00:15:54.567 --> 00:15:56.567
why not just say
off white or purple?

438
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.500
(Zoey chuckles)
- Welcome to weddings.

439
00:15:58.633 --> 00:16:00.133
- Oh. Zoey. you're disappearing.
Here. let me help you.

440
00:16:00.266 --> 00:16:02.133
- No. no. no. no.
no. I got this.

441
00:16:02.266 --> 00:16:03.033
- [Cara] Okay.

442
00:16:05.734 --> 00:16:06.467
- I like her already.

443
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.500
(Cara chuckles)

444
00:16:09.633 --> 00:16:11.934
- [Zoey] Meet Angelina
and Nicoletta.

445
00:16:12.066 --> 00:16:13.734
- Oh. Enchantee.

446
00:16:13.867 --> 00:16:17.000
- And I think we are done with
the Bella and the Delilah.

447
00:16:17.133 --> 00:16:17.934
if you don't mind.

448
00:16:18.066 --> 00:16:19.467
- I'd mind if you didn't.

449
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.834
(Megan chuckles)

450
00:16:20.967 --> 00:16:21.834
- Ooh.
- Mm.

451
00:16:23.533 --> 00:16:25.433
She's just like her brother.

452
00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:26.333
The cabin?

453
00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:28.433
So romantic.

454
00:16:28.567 --> 00:16:30.900
- Romantic and unilateral.

455
00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:32.767
I mean. be nice if
we could start making

456
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.000
these decisions as a couple.

457
00:16:35.133 --> 00:16:38.300
- Oh. you know. well. every
couple has their thing.

458
00:16:38.433 --> 00:16:41.266
Like. with Sean. for example.

459
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.967
before he went overseas.

460
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.467
I didn't care that we
didn't have a plan.

461
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.133
I just took things day by day.

462
00:16:47.266 --> 00:16:50.000
because every day was amazing.

463
00:16:51.266 --> 00:16:52.500
- And now?

464
00:16:52.633 --> 00:16:54.133
- I see the value of a plan.

465
00:16:55.467 --> 00:16:57.934
(Megan sighs)

466
00:16:58.066 --> 00:16:59.066
Oh. wow.

467
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.233
- Bad wow. good wow?

468
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.700
- Good wow.
(Cara sighs)

469
00:17:03.834 --> 00:17:04.967
You look like a bride.

470
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.200
- And you look like
a maid of honor.

471
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.333
- Have we found our
dresses in sync?

472
00:17:10.467 --> 00:17:13.000
- I think I'm saying
yes. to both of them.

473
00:17:13.133 --> 00:17:15.200
(Megan chuckles)

474
00:17:15.333 --> 00:17:16.633
- [Megan] Okay. Woo!

475
00:17:16.767 --> 00:17:17.700
- Let's go.
- Yes.

476
00:17:20.867 --> 00:17:21.900
- How's it going?

477
00:17:22.033 --> 00:17:23.367
- I think we found them.

478
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.033
(Zoey gasps)
Can you call the seamstress

479
00:17:25.166 --> 00:17:26.066
and ask her to
take measurements?

480
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.133
- Sure. Anything else?

481
00:17:27.266 --> 00:17:28.800
I know you're in a hurry.

482
00:17:28.934 --> 00:17:31.100
- Cara. can we put
the order through?

483
00:17:32.066 --> 00:17:34.133
- Aria in moonstone.
Adella in moonflower.

484
00:17:34.266 --> 00:17:35.233
- Copy that.

485
00:17:40.967 --> 00:17:43.233
Oh. The Aria gown in moonflower.
the Adella in moonstone.

486
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.333
- So. we get there tomorrow.
guests arrive Thursday.

487
00:17:56.467 --> 00:17:58.200
Wine. cheese. hugs. hellos.

488
00:17:58.333 --> 00:18:02.233
My mom takes over Friday
night as trivia host.

489
00:18:02.367 --> 00:18:04.734
and then. Saturday.
she officiates.

490
00:18:04.867 --> 00:18:05.934
And then...

491
00:18:06.066 --> 00:18:07.200
- I'm married. Just like that.

492
00:18:07.333 --> 00:18:08.567
- Now. all we have
to do is to get

493
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.166
all of this stuff up a mountain.

494
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.433
- Hm.
- Bride?

495
00:18:12.567 --> 00:18:13.900
Check.

496
00:18:14.033 --> 00:18:16.033
- You joke. but your
organizing skills are unreal.

497
00:18:16.166 --> 00:18:19.934
I mean. you have
backups for my backups.

498
00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:21.767
- Well. the last thing we need
is for you to get cold feet

499
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.200
because we forgot something.

500
00:18:23.333 --> 00:18:24.433
- And I am not even gonna start

501
00:18:24.567 --> 00:18:27.200
with the lifetime
supply of pine cones.

502
00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:30.066
- Wait until you see
them tipped in gold

503
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.033
with little place
cards set in them.

504
00:18:32.166 --> 00:18:34.333
- I'm sure they will
all be gorgeous.

505
00:18:34.467 --> 00:18:36.567
Just promise me it's
not too much for you.

506
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.033
- Oh. crafting is my
zen place right now.

507
00:18:39.166 --> 00:18:41.200
I'm actually really
looking forward to it.

508
00:18:41.333 --> 00:18:44.166
Now. the one thing I'm not
seeing are our dresses.

509
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.266
What's our status?

510
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.000
- Right. The salon is
backed up with alterations.

511
00:18:48.133 --> 00:18:50.600
but they said they would
express mail it to Clara Lake.

512
00:18:50.734 --> 00:18:52.200
- And you're okay with this?

513
00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:54.266
- I don't think I have a choice.

514
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.900
- We'll check in with them.
and then check in again.

515
00:18:58.033 --> 00:18:59.200
Now. the somethings?

516
00:18:59.333 --> 00:19:01.000
You've got new covered.

517
00:19:01.133 --> 00:19:03.800
- Sorely lacking old.
borrowed. and blue.

518
00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:06.633
- Well. I might have something
that covers your bases.

519
00:19:06.767 --> 00:19:09.600
- What?
(Megan chuckles)

520
00:19:09.734 --> 00:19:10.400
(Cara gasps)

521
00:19:10.533 --> 00:19:11.900
What is that?

522
00:19:12.033 --> 00:19:12.800
- Open it.

523
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.567
(Cara gasps)

524
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.967
- The bracelet I
made for you at camp.

525
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.667
- [Megan] The summer after
eighth grade. remember?

526
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.967
- Of course.
(Megan chuckles)

527
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.467
(both laughing)

528
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.066
I was so lucky to have you
then. and even more so now.

529
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.300
- Me too.
- Oh.

530
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.166
(Megan chuckles)

531
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.000
(gentle music)

532
00:19:45.266 --> 00:19:48.333
- So. what's everyone most
looking forward to this weekend?

533
00:19:48.467 --> 00:19:50.400
- Going back to the
place it all started.

534
00:19:50.533 --> 00:19:52.066
You?

535
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.000
- Oh. getting a hot stone
massage. if time permits.

536
00:19:54.133 --> 00:19:55.200
(Megan chuckles)
(Cara chuckles)

537
00:19:55.333 --> 00:19:57.166
- I heard something about
bride and groom trivia night?

538
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.734
- You may be best woman.

539
00:19:58.867 --> 00:20:00.100
but I suggest you
joining Team Bride.

540
00:20:00.233 --> 00:20:02.266
- Oh!
- She has been scouted

541
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.266
by Team Groom.

542
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.667
- Boo.
- What about you. Ben?

543
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.967
What are you looking forward to?

544
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.333
- Maybe the day
after the wedding.

545
00:20:07.467 --> 00:20:09.800
having the chalet to
ourselves for once.

546
00:20:09.934 --> 00:20:11.433
- Ha ha.
(Cara chuckles)

547
00:20:11.567 --> 00:20:12.400
- What?

548
00:20:12.533 --> 00:20:13.934
- Cara and I met Ben and Sean

549
00:20:14.066 --> 00:20:15.667
when we accidentally
double-booked the chalet.

550
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.100
- Right. and we shared
it begrudgingly.

551
00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:19.100
and then we ended up
liking each other.

552
00:20:19.233 --> 00:20:22.100
- And then realized that
we liked liked each other.

553
00:20:22.233 --> 00:20:24.133
- Years later. both couples
are still going strong.

554
00:20:24.266 --> 00:20:25.667
- Oh. that is so cool.

555
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.333
Did you and Sean get
engaged there too?

556
00:20:28.467 --> 00:20:31.934
- Oh. we're sort of not.

557
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.100
Our relationship has had a
couple more twists and turns.

558
00:20:35.233 --> 00:20:37.233
- Oh. I'm so stupid...

559
00:20:37.367 --> 00:20:39.233
You were such a pro
at the bridal salon.
I thought that you-

560
00:20:39.367 --> 00:20:41.066
- I was married?

561
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.100
No.

562
00:20:42.233 --> 00:20:44.100
But who knows what the
future holds. right?

563
00:20:44.233 --> 00:20:45.100
(Cara laughs)
Three seconds. guys.

564
00:20:45.233 --> 00:20:46.200
Ready?

565
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.066
- Clara Lake!

566
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.100
(camera snaps)

567
00:20:49.233 --> 00:20:51.667
(gentle music)

568
00:20:52.667 --> 00:20:54.600
- For any and all things
you need this weekend.

569
00:20:54.734 --> 00:20:56.767
consider me your point person.

570
00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.500
And since your chalet
is being transformed

571
00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:01.166
by our events team.

572
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.800
we have the bride in
our bachelorette suite.

573
00:21:03.934 --> 00:21:06.667
and the groom and his
sister in our family suite.

574
00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.367
all newly remodeled.

575
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.700
- Why all the changes?

576
00:21:09.834 --> 00:21:11.533
I mean. it was so
lovely already.

577
00:21:12.767 --> 00:21:14.500
(cellphone buzzes)

578
00:21:14.633 --> 00:21:15.967
- Excuse me.

579
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.667
Yes?
- It's crazy.

580
00:21:21.467 --> 00:21:24.133
- And welcome to your new abode.

581
00:21:24.266 --> 00:21:26.800
We have fireplaces
in every room.

582
00:21:26.934 --> 00:21:29.166
marble bathrooms loaded
with designer toiletries.

583
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.533
800-thread count duvets.

584
00:21:30.667 --> 00:21:33.033
- Am I a bride or the queen?

585
00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:35.567
- I think I've
found my workshop.

586
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.633
- And do not forget
about the balcony.

587
00:21:37.767 --> 00:21:39.867
which neighbors the groom's
so you can make the most

588
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.133
of your last moments together
before you say your "I dos."

589
00:21:43.266 --> 00:21:44.500
Any questions?

590
00:21:44.633 --> 00:21:46.467
- Yeah. Is our suite this nice?

591
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.433
- Let me show you.

592
00:21:49.166 --> 00:21:50.166
Right this way.

593
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.100
It's just around
the corner here.

594
00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:57.333
- All work and no play is never
a good idea at a ski chalet.

595
00:21:57.467 --> 00:22:00.300
- You know. think I saw
a movie about that once.

596
00:22:00.433 --> 00:22:03.200
- Hm.
- Actually. I'm setting up

597
00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:05.633
my "out of office"
reply for the first time

598
00:22:05.767 --> 00:22:07.600
since 2000 and...

599
00:22:08.667 --> 00:22:09.867
Never.

600
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.200
- Ooh. does that mean
you can get a run in?

601
00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:12.400
- Well. actually.
I was kinda hoping

602
00:22:12.533 --> 00:22:13.967
to get a head
start on all the...

603
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.400
Hey. hey. What are you doing?

604
00:22:15.533 --> 00:22:17.200
What happened to "I
need to pitch my book"?

605
00:22:17.333 --> 00:22:19.200
- Come on. indulge the bride.

606
00:22:19.333 --> 00:22:20.700
- Okay. you're right.

607
00:22:20.834 --> 00:22:21.967
(both laughing)

608
00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.633
All right. where
are the thermals?

609
00:22:24.767 --> 00:22:27.500
(gentle music)

610
00:22:28.433 --> 00:22:30.667
(Cara sighs)

611
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.500
- You know. there's just
one problem with the setup.

612
00:22:41.433 --> 00:22:43.066
I can't kiss you from over here.

613
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.066
- If only we could
bridge this divide.

614
00:22:46.567 --> 00:22:47.734
Snowdrift ramp?

615
00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:49.367
- It's never as
stable as you think.

616
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.233
especially this
late in the season.

617
00:22:51.367 --> 00:22:52.266
- Icicle ladder?

618
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.300
- Believe it or not.
I've had them fail me.

619
00:22:54.433 --> 00:22:55.533
- Then I guess
you're outta luck.

620
00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:56.934
- No more suggestions?

621
00:22:57.066 --> 00:22:58.333
- Only questions.

622
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.166
On the ride up. when Megan
said she wasn't engaged.

623
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.266
you looked like
you knew something.

624
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.734
- Sure you didn't imagine it?

625
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.433
- Do you always have
to be so mysterious?

626
00:23:08.567 --> 00:23:10.300
- Do you always have
to be so inquisitive?

627
00:23:10.433 --> 00:23:13.633
- Well. hazard of the mystery
writing trade. I guess.

628
00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:16.300
- [Megan] Cara. let's go!

629
00:23:16.433 --> 00:23:18.500
- Guess you'll have to
settle for an air kiss.

630
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.934
- It never feels like settling.

631
00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:23.467
- Oh. boy.

632
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.266
Come on.

633
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.667
(Ben laughs)

634
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.533
(gentle music)

635
00:23:35.467 --> 00:23:36.500
Woo-hoo.

636
00:23:38.734 --> 00:23:40.567
- [Megan] How did you
know to take me here?

637
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.500
- To the mountain?

638
00:23:42.633 --> 00:23:44.533
- No. to this exact spot.

639
00:23:45.567 --> 00:23:47.467
This is where Sean and
I did the photo shoot.

640
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.100
for the magazine. the
weekend we sort of.

641
00:23:49.233 --> 00:23:50.433
you know. fell for each other.

642
00:23:50.567 --> 00:23:51.600
- Well. then we'll have
to send him a picture.

643
00:23:51.734 --> 00:23:52.433
- Oh. Yeah.

644
00:23:52.567 --> 00:23:54.633
(Cara chuckles)

645
00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:56.367
- Phone?
- Yes.

646
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.433
Yeah.

647
00:23:57.567 --> 00:23:58.934
- Ready?
- Yes.

648
00:23:59.066 --> 00:24:00.266
(camera snaps)
- There it is.

649
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.367
Oh. Sean's gonna love that one.

650
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.934
- What should I text him?

651
00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:05.166
- "Wish you were here"?

652
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.233
- Hm! World's biggest
understatement.

653
00:24:08.333 --> 00:24:10.433
I don't know. it might sound
cliche for me to say this.

654
00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:13.934
but it feels like a piece of
me is missing without him here.

655
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.600
And I know he's off
helping a lot of people-

656
00:24:17.734 --> 00:24:20.500
- Doesn't make it any
easier to miss him.

657
00:24:20.633 --> 00:24:21.567
- I mean. you know
how long it took me

658
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.066
to find the right person.
and as soon as I did.

659
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.900
life just (exhales)
whisked him away.

660
00:24:27.033 --> 00:24:29.400
- Never know. life can
whisk all sorts of things

661
00:24:29.533 --> 00:24:31.500
at you when you least expect it.

662
00:24:31.633 --> 00:24:32.600
- Yeah.

663
00:24:33.967 --> 00:24:36.100
(Megan sighs)

664
00:24:36.233 --> 00:24:37.333
What?

665
00:24:37.467 --> 00:24:38.533
- What?

666
00:24:38.667 --> 00:24:39.367
- Why are you looking
at me like that?

667
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.533
- Like what?

668
00:24:40.667 --> 00:24:42.066
- Like...
(Cara laughs)

669
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.367
Like all...

670
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.667
- No reason. Let's go.

671
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.500
- [Megan] Okay.

672
00:24:46.633 --> 00:24:48.500
(Cara sighs)

673
00:24:48.633 --> 00:24:51.066
(gentle music)

674
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.767
- Well. we seem to have
our eye on the same board.

675
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.066
(Ben chuckles)

676
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.100
- And I seem to
be having deja vu.

677
00:25:07.233 --> 00:25:08.600
- Let me guess. it's not
the right board for me?

678
00:25:08.734 --> 00:25:11.433
- No. this time.
I'm sure it's right.

679
00:25:12.867 --> 00:25:14.600
- Well. I'm just glad
the Wing 3 made it out

680
00:25:14.734 --> 00:25:16.400
to Clara Lake
before it sold out.

681
00:25:16.533 --> 00:25:17.967
- I made sure of it.

682
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.033
The pro shop got a few. but
most of them went to Camp Snow.

683
00:25:23.233 --> 00:25:24.000
What?

684
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.767
- You really take care
of those Camp Snow kids.

685
00:25:28.633 --> 00:25:30.400
- It's important to me.

686
00:25:30.533 --> 00:25:32.667
- I know it is. and
that's why I love you.

687
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.800
(gentle music)

688
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.000
- You are way too deep in
thought for a ski resort.

689
00:25:44.133 --> 00:25:45.467
- I'm just hoping
I didn't get off

690
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.600
on the wrong foot with Megan.

691
00:25:46.734 --> 00:25:48.567
I mean. it's not
my smoothest move.

692
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.066
assuming she and Sean were-

693
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.300
- Hey. it's an honest
mistake. Don't sweat it.

694
00:25:52.433 --> 00:25:55.667
- There must be something
I can do. an olive branch?

695
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.333
- Well. maybe you could help
her and Cara with the wedding?

696
00:25:58.467 --> 00:26:01.467
- There is an awful lot
of DIY going on up there.

697
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.033
I mean. I'm into that.

698
00:26:03.166 --> 00:26:05.500
I can paint. sew. my glue
gun game is on point.

699
00:26:05.633 --> 00:26:06.667
I mean. I can even
decorate a cake.

700
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.600
but that's probably covered.

701
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.600
- [Ben] Sounds like a plan.

702
00:26:14.266 --> 00:26:15.834
- Weatherly Hotels?

703
00:26:15.967 --> 00:26:16.834
Why are they here?

704
00:26:19.166 --> 00:26:24.166
- So. I'm thinking cheese
board here. wine display there.

705
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.467
and please tell me that this
piano's not just for show.

706
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.900
- I've already booked Goldie.
our resident piano player.

707
00:26:30.033 --> 00:26:33.033
She is lovely. a
bit of a character.

708
00:26:33.166 --> 00:26:34.367
- Can't wait to meet her.

709
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.734
- What's our cheese
lineup looking like?

710
00:26:35.867 --> 00:26:38.567
- We have brie and
some hard cheeses.

711
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.300
And a mix of sheep and cow?

712
00:26:45.433 --> 00:26:47.333
- Mm.
- And goat. I think.

713
00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:50.467
- Okay. are we talking
locally sourced. artisanal?

714
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.567
- I tend to leave the
specifics up to the chef.

715
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.133
but I'm sure you could inquire.

716
00:26:54.266 --> 00:26:55.367
- Where's the kitchen?

717
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.734
(Megan chuckles)
(Cara chuckles)

718
00:26:58.867 --> 00:27:00.800
- Wow. She is on point.

719
00:27:00.934 --> 00:27:02.600
- No cheeseboard unturned.

720
00:27:02.734 --> 00:27:03.533
Mm.

721
00:27:03.667 --> 00:27:04.600
(Cara chuckles)

722
00:27:04.734 --> 00:27:07.266
- And. of course. the library.

723
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.934
- Hey. this wasn't here
the last time I was up.

724
00:27:11.066 --> 00:27:13.533
- Oh. yeah. this
is a little exhibit

725
00:27:13.667 --> 00:27:14.533
that I've been working on.

726
00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:17.200
Sorry about the mess.

727
00:27:17.333 --> 00:27:20.233
Most of Clara Lake's past is
packed up in archive boxes.

728
00:27:20.367 --> 00:27:22.667
so I kinda decided to curate.

729
00:27:23.834 --> 00:27:25.600
- Oh. This one's interesting.

730
00:27:25.734 --> 00:27:27.767
- Yeah. That's Max
and Clara Deeker.

731
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.600
He fell head over
heels for Clara.

732
00:27:30.734 --> 00:27:32.533
right around the time
he founded this resort.

733
00:27:32.667 --> 00:27:34.367
- And he named it after her.

734
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.800
- "For better or for worse."

735
00:27:35.934 --> 00:27:38.100
After they got married.
the country went to war.

736
00:27:38.233 --> 00:27:40.633
and Max enlisted.

737
00:27:40.767 --> 00:27:42.567
- Did he survive?

738
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:43.600
- Happily. yes.

739
00:27:43.734 --> 00:27:47.700
Sadly. I'm not totally
sure their marriage did.

740
00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:49.767
Couldn't find any pictures
of them together after that.

741
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.367
Just this one.

742
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.400
Max. alone at his cabin.

743
00:27:55.533 --> 00:27:56.667
- 1948.

744
00:27:58.233 --> 00:28:00.834
He looks so lonely up there.

745
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.500
I wonder what went wrong.

746
00:28:03.633 --> 00:28:06.867
- I suppose you could say
it's a bit of a mystery.

747
00:28:15.033 --> 00:28:16.667
- Welcome to wedding central.

748
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.433
- Wow. this is next level DIY.

749
00:28:19.567 --> 00:28:21.767
- Well. when you work for a
magazine that covers fashion.

750
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.467
wedding. and decor.
it kinda rubs off.

751
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.233
What can I do for you?

752
00:28:25.367 --> 00:28:26.600
- I came here to ask you that.

753
00:28:26.734 --> 00:28:28.266
See if I could lend a hand.

754
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.767
- Well. how would you
rate your crafting skills?

755
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.967
- Well. I'm a quick
draw with a glue gun

756
00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.767
and I got an A in penmanship.

757
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.233
- Well. I already started
on the calligraphy.

758
00:28:38.367 --> 00:28:41.000
so I don't want to change
the look halfway through.

759
00:28:41.133 --> 00:28:44.000
The party favors.
they're a little tricky.

760
00:28:44.133 --> 00:28:46.767
The woodsy chandelier.
it has to be just so.

761
00:28:48.633 --> 00:28:50.600
You're so sweet
to offer to help.

762
00:28:50.734 --> 00:28:51.834
but delegating at this point

763
00:28:51.967 --> 00:28:53.834
might make things
a little tricky.

764
00:28:54.633 --> 00:28:56.633
- Oh. What are the
pine cones for?

765
00:28:56.767 --> 00:28:59.000
- Oh. Those. they
need to be gilded.

766
00:28:59.133 --> 00:29:01.667
Every single tip.

767
00:29:02.934 --> 00:29:03.800
Have you ever used
gold leaf before?

768
00:29:03.934 --> 00:29:06.300
- I gilded the mantle
at my sorority house.

769
00:29:06.433 --> 00:29:09.500
so gold leaf and
I. we're old pals.

770
00:29:09.633 --> 00:29:11.133
- Well. you're about to get
to know each other even better

771
00:29:11.266 --> 00:29:13.900
because we have a
few more of them.

772
00:29:14.033 --> 00:29:15.000
- Great. What else?

773
00:29:16.834 --> 00:29:19.900
(gentle piano music)

774
00:29:31.467 --> 00:29:32.700
(patrons applauding)

775
00:29:32.834 --> 00:29:33.967
- Thank you.

776
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.900
Thank you. You're too kind.

777
00:29:36.033 --> 00:29:37.133
Thank you.

778
00:29:37.266 --> 00:29:38.900
- Goldie?
- The one and only.

779
00:29:39.033 --> 00:29:41.367
(Cara chuckles)
And you must be my bride?

780
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.700
- Yes. Cara.

781
00:29:42.834 --> 00:29:43.867
Daniel mentioned
you'll be playing

782
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.800
at our wine and cheese welcome?

783
00:29:45.934 --> 00:29:48.166
- Well. I suspect you're
wondering about my range.

784
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.033
Let me show you my book.

785
00:29:50.166 --> 00:29:50.967
(Cara chuckles)

786
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.200
- Oh. "Death on the Nile."

787
00:29:52.333 --> 00:29:54.567
- Not that book.
(chuckles) this one.

788
00:29:56.367 --> 00:29:57.800
Have you read it?

789
00:29:57.934 --> 00:30:00.367
- No. It's on my list.

790
00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.166
I'm saving it.

791
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.367
I'm a huge Agatha Christie fan.

792
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.200
- She really understood how
complicated we women are.

793
00:30:07.333 --> 00:30:08.967
The only thing. in my
mind. that's better

794
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.734
than a good villain
is a good villainess.

795
00:30:11.867 --> 00:30:13.967
- And finding out
what makes her tick.

796
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.000
- I'm only a few
chapters in. but so far.

797
00:30:16.133 --> 00:30:17.633
this one's unlucky in love.

798
00:30:17.767 --> 00:30:18.967
- Oh? How so?

799
00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.867
- She chose a man
who keeps secrets.

800
00:30:21.834 --> 00:30:23.800
- Oh.
(Cara chuckles)

801
00:30:23.934 --> 00:30:24.667
- Here.

802
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.667
Oh. there's a good one.

803
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.000
(gentle music)

804
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.667
- Thank you.

805
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.033
Oh. Pardon me.

806
00:30:36.166 --> 00:30:39.400
(Megan chuckles)

807
00:30:39.533 --> 00:30:40.367
Hey!
- Ta-da!

808
00:30:41.266 --> 00:30:43.233
All done.
(Megan gasps)

809
00:30:43.367 --> 00:30:44.834
- Oh. well done.

810
00:30:44.967 --> 00:30:47.166
These look fantastic.

811
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.400
- Well. like I said.
not my first rodeo.

812
00:30:49.533 --> 00:30:50.633
(cellphone chimes)
- Oh. Can you hold that?

813
00:30:50.767 --> 00:30:52.367
- Mm. oh.
- Hold on a second.

814
00:30:53.633 --> 00:30:54.967
(Megan sighs)

815
00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.300
(Megan groans)

816
00:30:56.433 --> 00:30:57.200
- Everything okay?

817
00:30:57.333 --> 00:30:58.834
- No. It's the bridal salon.

818
00:30:58.967 --> 00:31:00.734
They say the dresses won't
be ready till tomorrow.

819
00:31:00.867 --> 00:31:03.133
- Ooh. But the
wedding's in 48 hours.

820
00:31:03.266 --> 00:31:04.734
- I know. which is why
I'm not gonna chance it.

821
00:31:04.867 --> 00:31:06.734
I'll just go there and
pick them up myself.

822
00:31:06.867 --> 00:31:09.367
Okay.
- Or I could go.

823
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.633
- You'd drive all that way?

824
00:31:10.767 --> 00:31:12.233
- I mean. it makes way
more sense if I go.

825
00:31:12.367 --> 00:31:14.700
you have so much to do here.

826
00:31:14.834 --> 00:31:16.400
- I'm gonna take you
up on that. Thank you.

827
00:31:16.533 --> 00:31:18.200
But not a word to Cara. okay?

828
00:31:18.333 --> 00:31:19.800
I just don't want her
stressing out over it.

829
00:31:19.934 --> 00:31:21.633
- Top secret. no problem.

830
00:31:21.767 --> 00:31:22.900
(both chuckling)

831
00:31:23.033 --> 00:31:23.900
- [Receptionist] You're
all set. Ms. Reneau.

832
00:31:24.033 --> 00:31:25.867
- [Cara] Thank you.

833
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.900
- You know. the hair and makeup

834
00:31:28.033 --> 00:31:29.367
that I booked does manicures.

835
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.033
- Maybe I wasn't
booking a manicure.

836
00:31:31.166 --> 00:31:32.900
Maybe I was trying to surprise

837
00:31:33.033 --> 00:31:35.433
my very hard-working
maid of honor

838
00:31:35.567 --> 00:31:37.133
with a dual in-room
massage tomorrow.

839
00:31:37.266 --> 00:31:39.734
- Me? I don't know
if I can relax.

840
00:31:39.867 --> 00:31:41.600
There's just so much to do.

841
00:31:41.734 --> 00:31:42.800
Don't let me stop you though.

842
00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:45.433
- I was sorta hoping it would
be something we do together.

843
00:31:45.567 --> 00:31:46.767
- Yes. absolutely.

844
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.900
I just need to check
in with the sommelier

845
00:31:49.033 --> 00:31:52.433
about making sure the
temperature is just right.

846
00:31:55.333 --> 00:31:57.033
- Interesting.

847
00:31:57.166 --> 00:32:00.967
- Interesting that Ben
is talking to someone?

848
00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.200
- [Cara] Closed body
posture indicates

849
00:32:02.333 --> 00:32:04.467
that he's keeping
something under wraps.

850
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.867
- Ah. I see.

851
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.834
We're in mystery land again.

852
00:32:07.967 --> 00:32:09.367
Okay.
- Again?

853
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.867
- Well. you make frequent trips.

854
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.433
(both laughing)

855
00:32:13.567 --> 00:32:14.500
- I'm back.

856
00:32:14.633 --> 00:32:16.667
- Oh. good. 'cause we
need you for the wedding.

857
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.500
(both laughing)

858
00:32:17.633 --> 00:32:18.400
I'll see you.

859
00:32:20.233 --> 00:32:21.867
- I am just gonna
take care of...

860
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.033
- Wait.

861
00:32:23.166 --> 00:32:24.467
One more thing.

862
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:29.867
- Dad!

863
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.233
- You certainly chose a
beautiful place to get married.

864
00:32:35.967 --> 00:32:37.834
- Oh. now it feels real.

865
00:32:37.967 --> 00:32:39.834
- Well. there's nothing more
real than tying the knot.

866
00:32:39.967 --> 00:32:42.266
- Well. you and Mom always
made it look so easy.

867
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.600
- Oh.

868
00:32:43.734 --> 00:32:45.667
You know. your mom
would've loved Ben.

869
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.000
And seeing me walk
you down that aisle.

870
00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:49.934
And I promise I won't get
all choked up and silly.

871
00:32:50.066 --> 00:32:53.300
I got that out of my
system with the first-

872
00:32:53.433 --> 00:32:54.500
- Almost wedding?

873
00:32:54.633 --> 00:32:55.433
- Is that what they call it?

874
00:32:55.567 --> 00:32:56.767
- Yeah.

875
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.867
Don't worry. happy tears
are always welcome.

876
00:33:03.066 --> 00:33:06.033
Wow. look at how beautiful...

877
00:33:06.166 --> 00:33:07.100
Oh.

878
00:33:07.233 --> 00:33:08.867
(gentle piano music)

879
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:09.767
Aww.

880
00:33:11.533 --> 00:33:13.567
Isn't this the song that we
danced to that first night

881
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.233
at the Camp Snow auction?

882
00:33:15.367 --> 00:33:16.867
- The night we fell in love?

883
00:33:17.834 --> 00:33:20.967
I'm not sure. I was
pretty focused on you.

884
00:33:23.567 --> 00:33:26.200
- And to think. we were
strangers just a few years ago.

885
00:33:26.333 --> 00:33:27.500
and now we're
about to be family.

886
00:33:27.633 --> 00:33:29.567
- Zoey is so excited
to have a sister.

887
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.900
- Oh. so am I.

888
00:33:36.533 --> 00:33:39.533
(people chattering)

889
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.600
- Mom!

890
00:33:41.734 --> 00:33:43.200
(Michelle squeals)
Hi!

891
00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:45.200
- Mm!
- Michelle!

892
00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:46.066
Oh.
- Hello.

893
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.400
Oh!

894
00:33:47.533 --> 00:33:48.934
Now. know that Gerry
wanted to be here.

895
00:33:49.066 --> 00:33:50.900
but he is practically
running that convention.

896
00:33:51.033 --> 00:33:52.000
(Michelle laughs)
(Megan chuckles)

897
00:33:52.133 --> 00:33:52.900
Where she gets it from.

898
00:33:53.033 --> 00:33:54.433
(all laughing)

899
00:33:54.567 --> 00:33:55.767
- I totally understand.

900
00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.033
How was your drive
up from Portland?

901
00:33:57.166 --> 00:33:57.967
- Oh. it was fine.

902
00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.734
I mean. I wanted to
come up last night.

903
00:33:59.867 --> 00:34:01.233
but that's the thing is. when
you're hosting a radio show.

904
00:34:01.367 --> 00:34:03.100
if I play hooky.
everyone notices.

905
00:34:03.233 --> 00:34:04.233
(all chuckling)

906
00:34:04.367 --> 00:34:06.834
But being stuck in traffic
gave me time to fine tune

907
00:34:06.967 --> 00:34:08.734
those bride and groom
trivia questions.

908
00:34:08.867 --> 00:34:10.066
- You are too cute.

909
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.000
- Speaking of which. can
I grab you for a second?

910
00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:12.867
- [Cara] Oh. yeah.

911
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.066
- [Megan] I'll be
back in a minute.

912
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.000
- Go. go.
- Okay.

913
00:34:15.133 --> 00:34:16.934
- Hey!
- Hey. Ray.

914
00:34:17.066 --> 00:34:18.133
- [Ray] Hey. great to see you.

915
00:34:18.266 --> 00:34:19.600
- Mm!
(Ray chuckles)

916
00:34:19.734 --> 00:34:20.700
- What happened. Ray?

917
00:34:20.834 --> 00:34:23.800
Weren't we just sending
them to prom just yesterday?

918
00:34:23.934 --> 00:34:24.900
- Try kindergarten.

919
00:34:25.033 --> 00:34:26.100
(Michelle sighs)

920
00:34:26.233 --> 00:34:27.800
All goes by so fast.

921
00:34:27.934 --> 00:34:29.100
Oh. Yes.

922
00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:30.633
- [Michelle] Ah.

923
00:34:30.767 --> 00:34:32.166
- To the bride and groom.
- Thank you.

924
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.166
And their parents.

925
00:34:34.233 --> 00:34:35.233
(glasses clinking)

926
00:34:35.367 --> 00:34:38.467
(gentle piano music)

927
00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:47.967
- I just love your style.

928
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.934
- Right back at you. Ms. Reneau.

929
00:34:50.066 --> 00:34:51.266
I thought you looked familiar.

930
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.567
Turns out. I know you
from your book jacket.

931
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.433
- You read my book?

932
00:34:55.567 --> 00:34:58.100
- Both of them. I am a huge fan.

933
00:34:59.033 --> 00:35:00.367
- Thank you.

934
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.633
I'm so flattered.
Don't know what to say.

935
00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:04.633
- I just wanna know when
the next one's coming out.

936
00:35:04.767 --> 00:35:06.000
- Oh. well. that is one mystery

937
00:35:06.133 --> 00:35:08.066
that I can't quite
crack just yet.

938
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.467
I'm working on the
pitch this weekend.

939
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.367
- Hm. Find anything
to inspire you?

940
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.800
- This resort. actually.

941
00:35:15.934 --> 00:35:19.500
So much history and
romance. tragedy.

942
00:35:19.633 --> 00:35:21.734
- If I was getting married
in the next two days.

943
00:35:21.867 --> 00:35:23.400
I might focus on the first two.

944
00:35:24.467 --> 00:35:26.333
I play in the bar every night.

945
00:35:26.467 --> 00:35:27.533
if you wanna run
anything by me...

946
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:30.166
You know. one mystery
buff to another.

947
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.033
- Well. I might just
take you up on that.

948
00:35:32.166 --> 00:35:34.133
Oh. and how is
"Death on the Nile"-

949
00:35:34.266 --> 00:35:35.967
- Oh. no. no. no. no. No.

950
00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.900
If you're gonna read a mystery.
you've gotta unravel it.

951
00:35:39.033 --> 00:35:41.066
I wouldn't dare rob you of that.

952
00:35:44.867 --> 00:35:46.000
- Daniel.

953
00:35:46.133 --> 00:35:48.800
- Oh. Mr. Livingston.
you startled me.

954
00:35:48.934 --> 00:35:50.834
- Did you find out anything
more about what those execs

955
00:35:50.967 --> 00:35:52.533
from Weatherly
Hotels were up to?

956
00:35:53.233 --> 00:35:54.834
You have to admit it's strange.

957
00:35:54.967 --> 00:35:58.166
a big chain like that
sniffing around Clara Lake?

958
00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.700
- Mr. Livingston. my job
hinges on discretion.

959
00:36:01.834 --> 00:36:03.100
- Yeah. of course.

960
00:36:03.233 --> 00:36:05.233
I could ask around. do
some digging of my own.

961
00:36:05.367 --> 00:36:07.800
but I wouldn't wanna
be any trouble.

962
00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:11.567
Look. come on. is it a good
secret. or a bad secret?

963
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.033
- They're trying
to buy the resort.

964
00:36:14.166 --> 00:36:17.200
- Yeah. okay. I would
say that's a bad secret.

965
00:36:17.333 --> 00:36:18.066
What will happen to Camp Snow?

966
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.767
- I don't know.

967
00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.900
I'm sorry. I really
didn't want to upset you

968
00:36:22.033 --> 00:36:23.233
on your wedding weekend.

969
00:36:23.367 --> 00:36:24.567
- Yeah. okay. I'm
with you on that.

970
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.266
Look. do me a
favor. if you could

971
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.500
just keep this between
us. I'd appreciate it.

972
00:36:36.233 --> 00:36:43.033
(Ben sighs)

973
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.166
Hey. How'd you know
where to find me?

974
00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.934
- I had a hunch.

975
00:36:57.066 --> 00:36:58.600
Dad taught you to
snowboard here.

976
00:36:58.734 --> 00:37:00.233
- You know me pretty well. huh?

977
00:37:00.367 --> 00:37:01.600
- Yeah. I think you
might still have

978
00:37:01.734 --> 00:37:03.266
a few surprises up your sleeve.

979
00:37:04.533 --> 00:37:07.266
- Here's one: I was
once a camper here.

980
00:37:09.333 --> 00:37:12.400
After my dad passed. money
was tight for a few years.

981
00:37:12.533 --> 00:37:14.533
No more trips to the mountains.

982
00:37:14.667 --> 00:37:18.033
But then. along came Camp Snow.

983
00:37:18.166 --> 00:37:22.266
and it really got me
through a tough time.

984
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.233
I was lucky the
camp even existed.

985
00:37:24.367 --> 00:37:27.433
and that this resort
hosted it for free.

986
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.200
- And now look at you.
paying it forward.

987
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.367
First. giving boards.
Now. being on the board.

988
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.266
(Ben chuckles)

989
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.066
- See what you did there.

990
00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.166
(Cara chuckles)

991
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.767
- Why didn't you tell me before?

992
00:37:41.867 --> 00:37:43.333
- I guess you could say
I've spent my life playing

993
00:37:43.467 --> 00:37:45.033
my cards close to my chest.

994
00:37:46.033 --> 00:37:47.767
- Maybe it's time to open up.

995
00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.166
- Hm. But I only do that
over beers and brats.

996
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.400
How's tomorrow look?

997
00:37:52.533 --> 00:37:54.900
- Why do tomorrow
what we can do today?

998
00:37:55.033 --> 00:37:56.834
- I have got some
pressing matters today.

999
00:37:56.967 --> 00:37:58.233
- Camp Snow stuff?

1000
00:37:58.367 --> 00:37:59.500
- You could say that.

1001
00:37:59.633 --> 00:38:01.133
- All right. well. make
sure that they know

1002
00:38:01.266 --> 00:38:01.967
that the day after tomorrow-

1003
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.467
- The wedding?
- Yes.

1004
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.266
You are all mine.

1005
00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.433
(Cara chuckles)
- Good.

1006
00:38:07.567 --> 00:38:09.166
- Okay.

1007
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.433
- [Jill] Hey. Ben!

1008
00:38:10.567 --> 00:38:12.133
- Oh. I've been spotted.

1009
00:38:12.266 --> 00:38:14.166
Jill's not gonna let me leave
without throwing a few ollies.

1010
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.166
- All right. well. I'll be
sure to send over the medic.

1011
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.000
(Ben chuckles)

1012
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.000
Daniel's new exhibit.

1013
00:38:35.133 --> 00:38:35.934
Hm.

1014
00:38:36.967 --> 00:38:41.567
Is it just me. or did
people seem more glamorous

1015
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.100
in photos back then?

1016
00:38:43.233 --> 00:38:45.133
- I think they were
more glamorous.

1017
00:38:45.266 --> 00:38:46.233
(Cara chuckles)

1018
00:38:46.367 --> 00:38:47.500
How's the book pitch coming?

1019
00:38:47.633 --> 00:38:50.133
- It's starting to come along.

1020
00:38:50.266 --> 00:38:52.333
The romance part. anyway.

1021
00:38:54.533 --> 00:38:56.100
(camera snaps)
I'm basing the two detectives

1022
00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:58.734
on the legend of Max and Clara.

1023
00:38:58.867 --> 00:39:01.333
- You'll have to
refresh my memory.

1024
00:39:01.467 --> 00:39:03.133
- Well. from what I can gather.

1025
00:39:03.266 --> 00:39:05.300
the two of them
were deeply in love.

1026
00:39:05.433 --> 00:39:09.066
got married. then
separated by the war.

1027
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.200
I'm not sure exactly
how things fell apart.

1028
00:39:11.333 --> 00:39:15.200
but there are no pictures
of them together after that.

1029
00:39:15.333 --> 00:39:17.500
- Hm. Isn't that a pity?

1030
00:39:17.633 --> 00:39:19.133
- Yeah.

1031
00:39:19.266 --> 00:39:23.166
I imagine that Max became
a recluse in his cabin.

1032
00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.900
- [Goldie] And Clara?

1033
00:39:25.033 --> 00:39:29.333
- Clara went to San
Francisco for a fresh start.

1034
00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:32.500
but always wondered if she had
just seen the warning signs

1035
00:39:32.633 --> 00:39:34.066
before she tied the knot.

1036
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.467
if her life could've ended
up quite differently.

1037
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.233
- Huh.

1038
00:39:39.367 --> 00:39:41.233
You really do have
quite the imagination.

1039
00:39:43.633 --> 00:39:45.834
(people chattering)

1040
00:39:45.967 --> 00:39:47.667
- So Max and Clara
couldn't make it work.

1041
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.800
maybe my characters
can't either.

1042
00:39:49.934 --> 00:39:52.333
I don't know. what do you think?
You're the real detective.

1043
00:39:52.467 --> 00:39:55.033
- Retired. and on vacation.

1044
00:39:55.166 --> 00:39:56.367
- Still.

1045
00:39:57.133 --> 00:40:01.367
- Well. my advice. never
jump to conclusions.

1046
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.066
I mean. are you sure they
didn't end up together?

1047
00:40:05.266 --> 00:40:07.667
- Take a look.
What do you think?

1048
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.567
- Ah.

1049
00:40:09.867 --> 00:40:11.200
A stoic type.

1050
00:40:11.333 --> 00:40:14.166
- Dad. my stories don't
need to hold up in court.

1051
00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.767
they just need to capture
people's attention.

1052
00:40:18.533 --> 00:40:19.834
You see something. What is it?

1053
00:40:19.967 --> 00:40:22.734
- Well. based on
those buildings below.

1054
00:40:23.967 --> 00:40:26.533
I'll bet that cabin is near the
top of that northwest trail.

1055
00:40:26.667 --> 00:40:27.400
- Huh.

1056
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.433
- Could go up and take a look.

1057
00:40:35.934 --> 00:40:37.200
- All right. don't let up.

1058
00:40:37.333 --> 00:40:39.533
If you can't find them.
I can't buy this resort.

1059
00:40:39.667 --> 00:40:41.266
End of story. Thanks.

1060
00:40:42.266 --> 00:40:43.500
- Can I borrow your car?

1061
00:40:43.633 --> 00:40:45.533
I'm off to Seattle on a
secret wedding mission.

1062
00:40:45.667 --> 00:40:47.133
- Yeah. of course.

1063
00:40:47.266 --> 00:40:49.967
If you tell me how much of
that phone call you just heard.

1064
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.233
- Nothing.

1065
00:40:51.367 --> 00:40:53.567
Just that you're
buying the resort.

1066
00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.867
(Ben sighs)

1067
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.200
- All right. look. you
can't tell anyone. Zoey.

1068
00:40:57.333 --> 00:40:59.333
- Well. I won't. but. like.
that is a weird choice

1069
00:40:59.467 --> 00:41:00.700
for your wedding weekend.

1070
00:41:00.834 --> 00:41:01.867
- I know. but I'm
not the only person

1071
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.233
trying to buy the resort.

1072
00:41:03.367 --> 00:41:06.767
A big chain. Weatherly.
is trying to buy it too.

1073
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.867
And that could mean
the end of Camp Snow.

1074
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.533
- Well. can't you beat
them to the punch?

1075
00:41:10.667 --> 00:41:12.100
- That was the idea.

1076
00:41:12.233 --> 00:41:14.867
Trouble is. Clara Lake is owned
by three separate entities.

1077
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.533
A venture capitalist in New York

1078
00:41:16.667 --> 00:41:19.233
just sold his 45% to Weatherly.

1079
00:41:19.367 --> 00:41:20.567
- That's not a great start.

1080
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.266
- Another 45% belongs to
an investor in Seattle.

1081
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.066
He's a Camp Snow donor. and
he agreed to sell to me.

1082
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.767
- Oh. Okay. well. then
who owns the last 10%?

1083
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.100
- That's the trouble.

1084
00:41:29.233 --> 00:41:31.767
a shell corporation
called Aldera Creek.

1085
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.633
The only contact I
have is a law firm.

1086
00:41:34.767 --> 00:41:36.300
and they're stonewalling me.

1087
00:41:36.433 --> 00:41:38.266
- So close yet so far.

1088
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.467
- Yeah.

1089
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.767
Weatherly will walk if they
can't get a majority share.

1090
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.200
It's just a case of who
gets to Aldera Creek first.

1091
00:41:44.333 --> 00:41:46.633
- Well. there has to be a
person behind the company.

1092
00:41:46.767 --> 00:41:48.667
- Yeah. one that doesn't
want to be found.

1093
00:41:50.533 --> 00:41:52.100
Look. I gotta make some
more calls. all right?

1094
00:41:52.233 --> 00:41:53.233
- All right.

1095
00:41:56.166 --> 00:41:58.367
(Zoey humming)

1096
00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.266
(Zoey sighs)

1097
00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.300
- [Cara] Oh. Off for a drive?

1098
00:42:00.433 --> 00:42:02.133
- Oh. Yeah!

1099
00:42:02.266 --> 00:42:03.333
Just a little drive.

1100
00:42:03.467 --> 00:42:05.333
Hence the car.

1101
00:42:05.467 --> 00:42:07.367
- Right. You can't tell me
where you're going. can you?

1102
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.467
- Mm-mm.

1103
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.967
(Zoey chuckles)

1104
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.533
- Runs in the family.
this secretive streak?

1105
00:42:12.667 --> 00:42:13.834
- No. I'm an open book.

1106
00:42:13.967 --> 00:42:15.500
It's just Ben who's secretive.

1107
00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:17.533
- Oh. Well. then I'm
not the only one.

1108
00:42:17.667 --> 00:42:18.834
- No.

1109
00:42:18.967 --> 00:42:20.400
- I do wonder where
it comes from though.

1110
00:42:21.734 --> 00:42:26.133
- I mean. I guess it was
when our dad got sick.

1111
00:42:26.266 --> 00:42:28.200
- Oh. Zoey. I didn't mean-
- No. it's okay.

1112
00:42:28.333 --> 00:42:29.667
I mean. I was young.

1113
00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.433
and we all thought that
Dad would get better.

1114
00:42:33.567 --> 00:42:36.266
and I think Ben just
wanted to protect me

1115
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.467
from the burden me of
the bad news. but...

1116
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.467
When it came to me and my mom.

1117
00:42:41.266 --> 00:42:44.233
you know. he was kind
of our protector.

1118
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.567
I guess the role kinda stuck.

1119
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.433
(camera snaps)

1120
00:42:53.567 --> 00:42:55.266
(cellphone chiming)

1121
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.834
(Megan laughs)

1122
00:42:56.967 --> 00:42:58.467
- Talking to Sean?

1123
00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.533
- Texting.

1124
00:42:59.667 --> 00:43:02.200
He gave my place card
holders two thumbs up.

1125
00:43:02.333 --> 00:43:03.533
- Oh.
(Megan chuckles)

1126
00:43:03.667 --> 00:43:04.433
Well. if you find
a stopping place.

1127
00:43:04.567 --> 00:43:05.500
my dad and I are gonna look

1128
00:43:05.633 --> 00:43:07.600
for the resort founder's
cabin if you wanna come.

1129
00:43:07.734 --> 00:43:10.600
- Oh. as much as I love
Clara Lake history.

1130
00:43:10.734 --> 00:43:13.400
I gotta get these favors
done before massage o'clock.

1131
00:43:13.533 --> 00:43:15.700
- If I help. it'll
go twice as fast.

1132
00:43:15.834 --> 00:43:17.600
- Oh. no. no no. no.

1133
00:43:17.734 --> 00:43:19.266
I want this weekend
to be perfect for you.

1134
00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.333
so that means no
raffia paper cuts.

1135
00:43:21.467 --> 00:43:23.567
- Well. I would gladly
trade all the raffia

1136
00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.066
for more time with you.

1137
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.333
- Oh. Cara.

1138
00:43:26.467 --> 00:43:27.900
Why don't you ask Ben?

1139
00:43:28.033 --> 00:43:29.533
I'm sure your dad
would like that.

1140
00:43:29.667 --> 00:43:30.367
- Yeah. the more the merrier.

1141
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.533
Just he's busy with
Camp Snow stuff.

1142
00:43:32.667 --> 00:43:34.400
- Hm. that's strange.

1143
00:43:34.533 --> 00:43:36.333
I rode the elevator with
some Camp Snow kids.

1144
00:43:36.467 --> 00:43:38.100
and they said the
season ended yesterday.

1145
00:43:38.233 --> 00:43:40.700
(gentle music)

1146
00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:48.767
- Don't worry. I'm not
here for more intel.

1147
00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.533
I just got a text from
my friend Sean Butler.

1148
00:43:51.667 --> 00:43:54.500
"Did packages from
jewelry store show?"

1149
00:43:54.633 --> 00:43:56.367
I think he meant "package."

1150
00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.700
- I haven't heard anything.

1151
00:43:57.834 --> 00:44:00.133
but I'll let you know
the moment it arrives.

1152
00:44:00.266 --> 00:44:01.133
- Okay. Thanks.

1153
00:44:03.367 --> 00:44:04.133
- Hm.

1154
00:44:05.367 --> 00:44:05.967
- [Ray] Know what
this reminds me of?

1155
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.600
- [Cara] What's that?

1156
00:44:07.734 --> 00:44:10.467
- [Ray] When you were a kid
and used to play detective.

1157
00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.567
Whenever anyone lost their
keys. you were on the case.

1158
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.266
- Well. I wanted to
be just like you.

1159
00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.567
(Ray chuckles)

1160
00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.266
- And you wound up
being like your mom.

1161
00:44:19.567 --> 00:44:21.567
you got your
creativity from her.

1162
00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:22.500
- Don't sell yourself short.

1163
00:44:22.633 --> 00:44:24.600
I got my curiosity from someone.

1164
00:44:26.233 --> 00:44:28.467
Speaking of which.
shouldn't the cabin

1165
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.800
be around here somewhere?

1166
00:44:29.934 --> 00:44:31.734
- Yeah. think it was.

1167
00:44:31.867 --> 00:44:33.367
Just not anymore.

1168
00:44:38.567 --> 00:44:40.400
- Hey. Look.

1169
00:44:40.533 --> 00:44:43.133
Isn't that the same
bench from the photo?

1170
00:44:43.266 --> 00:44:44.133
Look at that.

1171
00:44:44.266 --> 00:44:45.300
- Yeah.

1172
00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:47.934
(gentle music)

1173
00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.400
(Cara gasps)

1174
00:44:55.533 --> 00:44:56.567
- Look!

1175
00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:57.800
MD plus CD.

1176
00:44:57.934 --> 00:44:58.867
Max and Clara.

1177
00:45:00.166 --> 00:45:03.500
- Mm. Well. maybe
they were here.

1178
00:45:03.633 --> 00:45:05.333
- Yeah. doesn't prove that
their marriage survived.

1179
00:45:05.467 --> 00:45:08.567
Just means they
were in love. once.

1180
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.233
- Okay. so we don't
know all the answers.

1181
00:45:10.367 --> 00:45:14.333
But. well. missing cabin.
does that help with your book?

1182
00:45:14.467 --> 00:45:16.200
- At this point. couldn't hurt.

1183
00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:23.400
(Ray chuckles)

1184
00:45:23.533 --> 00:45:24.767
Thank you. again.

1185
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.066
- [Michelle] Hey.
How are my girls?

1186
00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.834
- I am so happy we
made this happen.

1187
00:45:31.967 --> 00:45:34.000
I owe you a seaweed wrap.

1188
00:45:34.133 --> 00:45:35.800
Megan clearly needed the break.

1189
00:45:35.934 --> 00:45:38.233
- Well. where is she? I made
her a cup of calming tea.

1190
00:45:38.367 --> 00:45:40.500
- Oh. she might not need it.

1191
00:45:40.633 --> 00:45:42.066
She fell asleep. I
didn't want to wake her.

1192
00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.734
- Well. that gives us
the time to catch up.

1193
00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.367
(Michelle sighs)

1194
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.500
Megan's always
taking on too much.

1195
00:45:49.633 --> 00:45:53.066
I mean. I know that Sean's
new job has been hard on her.

1196
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.300
but I didn't think she'd ever
find solace in a glue gun.

1197
00:45:56.433 --> 00:45:59.867
- I think she finds
crafting therapeutic.

1198
00:46:00.066 --> 00:46:00.767
- Do you?

1199
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.467
(Michelle chuckles)

1200
00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:03.233
- Well. the wedding's tomorrow.

1201
00:46:03.367 --> 00:46:04.967
This'll all be over soon enough.

1202
00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.266
- Not exactly the
happy words of a bride.

1203
00:46:10.333 --> 00:46:11.834
- Something's up with Ben.

1204
00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:16.033
Just seems distracted.

1205
00:46:16.166 --> 00:46:18.233
- Well. maybe something is up.

1206
00:46:18.367 --> 00:46:19.600
Maybe that something has
nothing to do with you.

1207
00:46:19.734 --> 00:46:21.767
- Well. that's a
lovely thought. but-

1208
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.533
- Ah. Then let's hold onto it.

1209
00:46:24.667 --> 00:46:26.400
If you think the
worst in people.

1210
00:46:26.533 --> 00:46:28.433
sometimes they live up to it.

1211
00:46:28.567 --> 00:46:32.533
But if you believe the best.
you often get the best.

1212
00:46:32.667 --> 00:46:34.133
Worth a shot. right?

1213
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.433
- [Cara] Mm.

1214
00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:46.200
- Nothing like a hot
brat on a cold day.

1215
00:46:46.333 --> 00:46:47.734
- A well-dressed brat.

1216
00:46:48.934 --> 00:46:50.133
That's what sealed
the deal. you know?

1217
00:46:50.266 --> 00:46:51.700
- My garnishing skills?
- Mm.

1218
00:46:51.834 --> 00:46:52.633
I fell hard.

1219
00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.533
- And I fell for you.

1220
00:46:55.667 --> 00:46:57.834
'cause I feel like I
can tell you anything.

1221
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.700
You know. it's funny.
we make plans based on

1222
00:47:03.834 --> 00:47:04.967
what we think will happen.

1223
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.200
and then life just
throws us curveballs.

1224
00:47:09.166 --> 00:47:10.767
- What's on your mind?

1225
00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.867
- Just wanted this
weekend to go off

1226
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.767
without a hitch. you know?

1227
00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.967
- And if you ask me. it is.

1228
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.667
Hey. we're getting
married tomorrow.

1229
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.767
in this place that
means the world to us.

1230
00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:25.867
But I'm interrupting.
I'm sorry. go ahead.

1231
00:47:28.767 --> 00:47:29.734
Is this about us?

1232
00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:31.667
- No.

1233
00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.533
It's about Sean.

1234
00:47:34.667 --> 00:47:35.433
- Sean?

1235
00:47:35.567 --> 00:47:37.767
- Yeah. he sent a
ring. to the hotel.

1236
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.000
(Cara gasps)
And it might even be here now.

1237
00:47:39.133 --> 00:47:41.800
- He's gonna propose to Megan?

1238
00:47:41.934 --> 00:47:43.800
- Yeah. and I need your help.

1239
00:47:43.934 --> 00:47:44.600
- Of course!

1240
00:47:44.734 --> 00:47:47.533
(Cara chuckles)

1241
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.867
(door opens)

1242
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.033
What happened to your nap?

1243
00:48:06.166 --> 00:48:07.867
- Oh. studies say power naps are

1244
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.533
just as effective
as traditional naps.

1245
00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:11.667
- Well. since you're refreshed.

1246
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.834
what are the odds that Ben
and I could steal you away

1247
00:48:13.967 --> 00:48:15.200
for a sunset drink?

1248
00:48:15.333 --> 00:48:16.667
- You know. can we make
it a twilight drink?

1249
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.433
I just have a lot to
do before trivia night.

1250
00:48:18.567 --> 00:48:19.433
- Better views at sunset.

1251
00:48:19.567 --> 00:48:20.834
- It's harder to get a table.

1252
00:48:20.967 --> 00:48:22.467
- Good thing we
reserved a fireplace.

1253
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.133
(both chuckling)

1254
00:48:24.266 --> 00:48:26.633
I am not taking
no for an answer.

1255
00:48:26.767 --> 00:48:28.600
- I am busy because I love you.

1256
00:48:28.734 --> 00:48:31.500
- Oh. I love you too. but
love means a lot of things.

1257
00:48:31.633 --> 00:48:33.467
- Yes. it does. like sacrifice.

1258
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.200
- Love is being there.

1259
00:48:35.333 --> 00:48:36.867
- And being accountable.

1260
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.300
- Not to mention flexible.

1261
00:48:38.433 --> 00:48:39.367
- We could go on all
day. couldn't we?

1262
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.433
- Not really. We have our
reservation at sunset.

1263
00:48:41.567 --> 00:48:43.533
(both chuckling)

1264
00:48:43.667 --> 00:48:44.633
Let me do this for you.

1265
00:48:44.767 --> 00:48:46.967
Just a couple of hours.

1266
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.600
Megan. you are the
best maid of honor

1267
00:48:48.734 --> 00:48:50.033
that anyone could ever ask for.

1268
00:48:50.166 --> 00:48:52.033
And no one could be more
appreciative than me.

1269
00:48:52.166 --> 00:48:53.500
down to the very last-

1270
00:48:53.633 --> 00:48:56.834
(objects crunching)

1271
00:48:56.967 --> 00:48:57.834
Pine cone.

1272
00:49:03.133 --> 00:49:04.233
- That's okay.

1273
00:49:04.367 --> 00:49:05.133
It's okay.

1274
00:49:06.734 --> 00:49:07.700
(Cara chuckles)

1275
00:49:07.834 --> 00:49:10.667
(gentle music)

1276
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.166
We've gotta be able
to find pine cones

1277
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:13.533
somewhere around here.

1278
00:49:13.667 --> 00:49:14.900
- Well. hopefully.
on the speedy side.

1279
00:49:15.033 --> 00:49:16.867
don't wanna miss
our sunset drinks.

1280
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:17.767
- Over there.

1281
00:49:19.633 --> 00:49:21.500
- What? We can't reach those.

1282
00:49:21.633 --> 00:49:23.567
- Of course we can. if
you give me a boost.

1283
00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.867
- Are you serious?

1284
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.166
- Yeah. we used to do
it all the time as kids.

1285
00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.066
Come on. come on.
- Oh. goodness.

1286
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.266
I mean. the ground's

1287
00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.400
not exactly stable.
- Ready. one.

1288
00:49:30.533 --> 00:49:32.100
- This is bad.
- Two.

1289
00:49:32.233 --> 00:49:33.166
- Please. please. please.
- Three.

1290
00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.233
- Please. Oh.
(Megan grunting)

1291
00:49:35.367 --> 00:49:36.333
Boy. You got it?

1292
00:49:36.467 --> 00:49:37.233
- No. No!

1293
00:49:38.567 --> 00:49:39.333
(Megan grunts)
- Oh!

1294
00:49:39.467 --> 00:49:40.500
I'm losing...

1295
00:49:40.633 --> 00:49:42.667
(both screaming)

1296
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.600
- [Megan] Oh!

1297
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.200
- Would it be that awful
if two people didn't have

1298
00:49:48.333 --> 00:49:50.533
pine cone holders for
their place cards?

1299
00:49:50.667 --> 00:49:51.333
- I doubt they'll even notice.

1300
00:49:51.467 --> 00:49:52.934
(Cara sighs)
(pine cone clatters)

1301
00:49:53.066 --> 00:49:55.633
(both laughing)

1302
00:49:57.233 --> 00:49:59.734
(gentle music)

1303
00:50:01.533 --> 00:50:02.567
- [Ben] How's the
chocolate fondue?

1304
00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:03.867
- Perfect temp.

1305
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.667
And for the record. I
did not sneak one bite.

1306
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.533
- Liar.

1307
00:50:07.667 --> 00:50:08.533
Proud of you.

1308
00:50:08.667 --> 00:50:10.066
The champagne is chilled.

1309
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.667
- Okay. Mom's on the way.
(cellphone chimes)

1310
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:13.533
- And that's Daniel.

1311
00:50:13.667 --> 00:50:15.500
Okay. he's heading
over with the box.

1312
00:50:15.633 --> 00:50:17.800
- Great.
- Now. all we need is Sean.

1313
00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.100
- And Megan.

1314
00:50:20.233 --> 00:50:21.100
I'll go nudge her.

1315
00:50:25.033 --> 00:50:27.934
- You know what. Zoey? I am
done obsessing over the details.

1316
00:50:28.066 --> 00:50:29.500
If the dresses are ready.
just bring them up.

1317
00:50:29.633 --> 00:50:31.600
- Oh. they're ready.
Altered. paid for.

1318
00:50:31.734 --> 00:50:33.166
- So?
- I mean. they're gorgeous.

1319
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.066
It's just a choice.

1320
00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.767
- I don't understand.

1321
00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.834
- How about I send you
a photo. just in case?

1322
00:50:39.967 --> 00:50:40.734
(camera snaps)
- Sure. sure.

1323
00:50:40.867 --> 00:50:42.066
Do what you gotta do.

1324
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.400
You know what. Zoey?
I gotta get going.

1325
00:50:44.533 --> 00:50:46.767
Just bring the dresses
up in one piece. okay?

1326
00:50:47.667 --> 00:50:48.633
- All right. Okay.

1327
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.567
- Hey. So. do I need my purse?

1328
00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:53.667
My coat?

1329
00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.600
Anything?
- No and no. just you.

1330
00:50:55.734 --> 00:50:56.934
Let's go.

1331
00:50:57.066 --> 00:50:59.900
- Okay.
(Cara laughs)

1332
00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:01.633
(door opens)

1333
00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:03.967
(cellphone chimes)
(cellphone buzzes)

1334
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:04.900
(door closes)

1335
00:51:05.033 --> 00:51:06.734
- Hey. man. looking sharp.

1336
00:51:06.867 --> 00:51:09.166
- Yeah. well. I'm
really nervous. so-

1337
00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.500
- Don't worry about that.

1338
00:51:10.633 --> 00:51:11.734
Look. we've got it
all under control.

1339
00:51:11.867 --> 00:51:14.734
Getting Megan overseas with
you. that's what's important.

1340
00:51:14.867 --> 00:51:15.600
- I love your enthusiasm.

1341
00:51:15.734 --> 00:51:18.266
but that's a separate
conversation.

1342
00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.100
Megan's got like a
full-blown career.

1343
00:51:20.233 --> 00:51:21.600
and I just can't
swoop in and like-

1344
00:51:21.734 --> 00:51:23.233
- Oh. she'd go.

1345
00:51:23.367 --> 00:51:24.133
Hypothetically.

1346
00:51:24.266 --> 00:51:24.934
- What about the magazine?

1347
00:51:25.066 --> 00:51:26.667
- She can work remotely.

1348
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.700
Not that she's asked
or looked it up.

1349
00:51:30.367 --> 00:51:31.667
(Ben chuckles)
(Michelle gasps)

1350
00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.600
The ring is here.

1351
00:51:32.734 --> 00:51:34.467
It's happening.

1352
00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.633
- [Sean] Guys. I
just had one thing

1353
00:51:36.767 --> 00:51:38.333
that I wanted to talk
to you about before-

1354
00:51:38.467 --> 00:51:39.567
- She's heading over. You
have your speech prepared?

1355
00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.633
- Yeah. Yeah. I've got it
prepared. but I just wanted to-

1356
00:51:42.767 --> 00:51:44.500
- She's here. act normal.

1357
00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.767
- Hey. guys. Sorry I'm late.

1358
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:48.734
Mom?

1359
00:51:48.867 --> 00:51:49.800
Hi!
- Hi!

1360
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:51.734
- [Megan] Hey.

1361
00:51:51.867 --> 00:51:52.500
- [Michelle] I was
just passing through.

1362
00:51:52.633 --> 00:51:53.600
thought I'd join you.

1363
00:51:53.734 --> 00:51:54.667
- [Megan] That's nice...

1364
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.600
Sean. hi!

1365
00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.367
- Hey.

1366
00:52:00.767 --> 00:52:02.600
I wish I was there
with you in person.

1367
00:52:03.667 --> 00:52:04.633
where this all started.

1368
00:52:04.767 --> 00:52:06.233
- Hurry.
- Yeah. I'm trying.

1369
00:52:06.367 --> 00:52:07.567
- Okay.

1370
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.700
- A few years ago.
we all had drinks

1371
00:52:08.834 --> 00:52:10.734
around the fire
for the first time.

1372
00:52:10.867 --> 00:52:15.533
Who would have thought
that it was a beginning

1373
00:52:15.667 --> 00:52:16.900
of something much bigger.

1374
00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.500
- Oh.

1375
00:52:18.633 --> 00:52:19.734
- And now...

1376
00:52:19.867 --> 00:52:20.834
(Cara gasps)
(box thuds)

1377
00:52:20.967 --> 00:52:22.333
- Cara. did you...

1378
00:52:23.767 --> 00:52:24.934
What are you doing?

1379
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.767
- I am so thrilled to have the
honor of showing you (sighs)

1380
00:52:32.834 --> 00:52:37.834
the most beautiful pair of men's
cufflinks I have ever seen.

1381
00:52:38.667 --> 00:52:40.333
(Cara chuckles)

1382
00:52:40.467 --> 00:52:42.667
- Sean was worried they
wouldn't get here on time.

1383
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.667
- [Cara] Oh.

1384
00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.166
- Look. they came. babe.

1385
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.667
- They're here.
(Megan laughs)

1386
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.333
- Yeah.
- Yay.

1387
00:52:48.467 --> 00:52:50.367
- One of several packages
that I sent to the hotel.

1388
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.734
like I was trying to tell you.

1389
00:52:52.867 --> 00:52:54.000
- [Cara] Surprise. Ben!

1390
00:52:54.133 --> 00:52:55.900
(Cara chuckles)
- You got me!

1391
00:52:56.033 --> 00:52:58.734
- Yeah. and we were
all here to see it.

1392
00:52:59.867 --> 00:53:01.367
Cheers.

1393
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:03.600
To the best friends
anyone could ever ask for.

1394
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.967
- Cara. shouldn't we
pop the champagne first?

1395
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.400
- Oh. Right.

1396
00:53:08.533 --> 00:53:09.867
That's why you're in charge.

1397
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.467
Okay.

1398
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.667
Perfectly chilled.

1399
00:53:13.567 --> 00:53:14.867
It's gonna be great.

1400
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.033
Sean. I'm so sorry.

1401
00:53:17.166 --> 00:53:18.633
I don't even know what to say.

1402
00:53:18.767 --> 00:53:20.800
- I do. Blame me. I'm the
one who jumped the gun.

1403
00:53:20.934 --> 00:53:22.133
But thanks to your
quick thinking.

1404
00:53:22.266 --> 00:53:23.700
I don't think she
actually realized.

1405
00:53:23.834 --> 00:53:24.967
- [Sean] I'm sure the
ring will be there soon.

1406
00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:27.900
but the truth is. my
timing is way off.

1407
00:53:28.033 --> 00:53:29.100
- No. no. no. no. no.
- No. come on. Sean.

1408
00:53:29.233 --> 00:53:30.700
- [Sean] You two
are getting married.

1409
00:53:30.834 --> 00:53:31.667
Tomorrow!

1410
00:53:32.367 --> 00:53:34.600
Let's just focus on that. okay?

1411
00:53:34.734 --> 00:53:35.600
- All right.

1412
00:53:35.734 --> 00:53:36.934
- Sounds good.
- Thanks. man.

1413
00:53:37.066 --> 00:53:38.967
- [Sean] All right. I'll
give you a call later.

1414
00:53:39.867 --> 00:53:40.900
- So much for that.

1415
00:53:42.567 --> 00:53:44.567
- What's with the
squirrel cufflinks?

1416
00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.133
- It's a secret.

1417
00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:49.400
- A secret squirrel?

1418
00:53:49.533 --> 00:53:50.700
- Exactly.

1419
00:53:50.834 --> 00:53:52.500
- Do you wanna tell
me what it means?

1420
00:53:55.166 --> 00:53:57.100
- Wouldn't be much
of a secret if I did.

1421
00:53:57.233 --> 00:53:58.000
- Huh.

1422
00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:11.400
What's that?

1423
00:54:11.533 --> 00:54:12.600
A love letter?

1424
00:54:13.266 --> 00:54:14.600
- [Daniel] Read it and see.

1425
00:54:15.934 --> 00:54:18.000
- March 1948.

1426
00:54:18.133 --> 00:54:19.633
Dear Clara. I've just had

1427
00:54:19.767 --> 00:54:21.667
the most glorious
day at the lodge.

1428
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:25.500
but a cloud comes over
me when I think of you.

1429
00:54:25.633 --> 00:54:30.300
Sadly. for some love stories
are simply not meant to be.

1430
00:54:30.433 --> 00:54:33.567
I fear that once lost.
trust is gone forever.

1431
00:54:34.433 --> 00:54:37.400
But don't despair. I
know you'll love again.

1432
00:54:37.533 --> 00:54:38.500
All my love. M.

1433
00:54:41.767 --> 00:54:43.567
(Cara sighs)

1434
00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.367
Deception. a tragic breakup.

1435
00:54:47.633 --> 00:54:48.367
- Go on.

1436
00:54:49.767 --> 00:54:50.767
- Oh.

1437
00:54:52.166 --> 00:54:54.333
I didn't know that Clara
was the perpetrator.

1438
00:54:54.467 --> 00:54:56.133
and Max the victim.

1439
00:54:56.266 --> 00:54:57.734
- And that's who sent it?

1440
00:54:58.934 --> 00:55:00.800
- Well. who else
could've written it?

1441
00:55:08.934 --> 00:55:11.734
(Megan sighs)

1442
00:55:11.867 --> 00:55:13.133
I mean. I gotta hand it to you.

1443
00:55:13.266 --> 00:55:15.600
I wasn't sure
about these shirts.

1444
00:55:15.734 --> 00:55:18.300
but we are gonna look
cute while kicking butt.

1445
00:55:18.433 --> 00:55:19.266
- Oh. yeah.

1446
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.800
(Megan chuckles)

1447
00:55:20.934 --> 00:55:24.033
(Megan sighs)

1448
00:55:24.166 --> 00:55:24.900
- All good?

1449
00:55:25.033 --> 00:55:25.734
- Huh?

1450
00:55:25.867 --> 00:55:27.734
- You seem distracted.

1451
00:55:27.867 --> 00:55:28.633
- Oh.

1452
00:55:28.767 --> 00:55:30.066
- Please tell me it's
not craft-related.

1453
00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.200
- Oh. no. no. no.

1454
00:55:31.333 --> 00:55:32.800
It's just that...

1455
00:55:34.033 --> 00:55:38.367
Sean was acting a little odd
earlier today. don't you think?

1456
00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.133
- Weddings make
everyone emotional.

1457
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:42.967
- Yeah. You're right.

1458
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:44.600
Well. it's getting late.

1459
00:55:44.734 --> 00:55:45.734
I better head down there. make
sure everything's in order.

1460
00:55:45.867 --> 00:55:46.467
See you there?
- Yeah.

1461
00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.000
I'll grab my phone.
- Okay.

1462
00:55:49.333 --> 00:55:50.533
- Hello?
- Oh. hey. Ray.

1463
00:55:50.667 --> 00:55:51.433
- [Ray] Hey.

1464
00:55:51.567 --> 00:55:54.266
- I better see you
wearing one of these.

1465
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.367
Trivia.
- Oh.

1466
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.734
Oh. that's my color.

1467
00:55:56.867 --> 00:55:57.834
(both chuckling)

1468
00:55:57.967 --> 00:56:00.100
I'm just dropping off a
sentimental gift for Cara.

1469
00:56:00.233 --> 00:56:02.200
- Oh. Well. I'll
leave you to it. then.

1470
00:56:02.333 --> 00:56:03.667
- Dad.
- Hey.

1471
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.500
- [Cara] Hey.

1472
00:56:05.633 --> 00:56:07.667
- Well. I heard sometimes
people sew a bit

1473
00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.133
of their mum's wedding dress
into the lining for good luck.

1474
00:56:10.266 --> 00:56:12.033
I wasn't sure what
part you'd want.

1475
00:56:12.166 --> 00:56:14.600
so I had the whole
thing cleaned.

1476
00:56:14.734 --> 00:56:17.600
- Dad. This is beautiful.

1477
00:56:17.734 --> 00:56:18.734
Thank you.

1478
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.300
I forgot what an eye
for fashion Mom had.

1479
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.700
- Yeah. she had a lot of gifts.

1480
00:56:27.233 --> 00:56:29.700
Well. I'll let you
get ready. then.

1481
00:56:29.834 --> 00:56:30.633
- Okay.

1482
00:56:31.934 --> 00:56:32.900
- Unless you wanna talk.

1483
00:56:34.133 --> 00:56:35.934
(Cara sighs)

1484
00:56:36.066 --> 00:56:36.834
What?

1485
00:56:40.734 --> 00:56:42.133
(Cara sighs)

1486
00:56:42.266 --> 00:56:46.867
- It's just Ben is
being so secretive.

1487
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.166
It's not what I imagined
for our marriage.

1488
00:56:50.467 --> 00:56:51.400
- If you're worried
about Ben. don't be.

1489
00:56:51.533 --> 00:56:55.133
Hey. I spent years analyzing
people for a living.

1490
00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.500
he's a good guy.

1491
00:56:57.633 --> 00:56:59.367
- Yeah. but good guys
keep secrets too.

1492
00:57:00.667 --> 00:57:02.200
- Well. so he's
not an open book.

1493
00:57:03.166 --> 00:57:05.300
That isn't always a bad
thing in a marriage.

1494
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.567
Well. when I married your mom.

1495
00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.000
I took her to Waikiki
for our honeymoon.

1496
00:57:10.133 --> 00:57:13.133
She was so excited. "I can't
wait to go surfing with you."

1497
00:57:15.033 --> 00:57:16.533
We get there. and guess what?

1498
00:57:16.667 --> 00:57:17.834
- No.
(Ray laughs)

1499
00:57:17.967 --> 00:57:18.834
She couldn't swim.

1500
00:57:18.967 --> 00:57:20.033
- Bingo.
- Oh. no.

1501
00:57:21.867 --> 00:57:24.166
Well. she always
called it an epic trip.

1502
00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.934
- Yeah. spent in the shallow
end of the pool. but yes.

1503
00:57:27.066 --> 00:57:28.734
- Well. that's Mom for you.

1504
00:57:28.867 --> 00:57:31.066
She always glossed things
over to make people happy.

1505
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.900
- Which. in a weird way.
helped us have a good marriage.

1506
00:57:35.133 --> 00:57:38.200
I'm just saying. sometimes flaws
can turn out to be virtues.

1507
00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.600
Just depends on
how you look at it.

1508
00:57:45.834 --> 00:57:47.333
- No. I get it. it's a dead end.

1509
00:57:47.467 --> 00:57:49.767
Just keep trying with
Aldera Creek. thanks.

1510
00:57:51.834 --> 00:57:53.166
(both chuckling)

1511
00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.934
- Yeah? You like it?

1512
00:57:55.066 --> 00:57:56.700
What's Aldera Creek?

1513
00:57:57.633 --> 00:57:59.500
- Nothing. Just a
company I'm researching.

1514
00:57:59.633 --> 00:58:01.600
- Oh? Why?

1515
00:58:01.734 --> 00:58:04.967
- I'm hoping they can
help me with something.

1516
00:58:05.934 --> 00:58:06.867
- With what?

1517
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.734
- You know. five minutes
before a trivia contest.

1518
00:58:11.867 --> 00:58:13.667
you might wanna switch into
question answering mode.

1519
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.867
- Yeah. well. I could
say the same about you.

1520
00:58:17.867 --> 00:58:18.934
(hand knocking)

1521
00:58:19.066 --> 00:58:20.266
- You ready for battle?

1522
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.467
- Ready as I'll ever be.

1523
00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.734
(Michelle chuckles)

1524
00:58:26.867 --> 00:58:27.867
- Okay.

1525
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.567
- [Zoey] Hey!

1526
00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:33.800
- Ah. brilliant. You
made it just in time.

1527
00:58:33.934 --> 00:58:36.066
- I didn't hear back
from you. so I figured-

1528
00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.900
- [Michelle] Hey.
Ben's on his way.

1529
00:58:38.033 --> 00:58:38.734
- Oh.
(Michelle chuckles)

1530
00:58:38.867 --> 00:58:39.800
Should I take these
up to your room?

1531
00:58:39.934 --> 00:58:41.100
- Oh. no. no. no. no. no.

1532
00:58:41.233 --> 00:58:42.333
Call me superstitious.
but I don't want Ben

1533
00:58:42.467 --> 00:58:44.333
to even cross paths
with that dress.

1534
00:58:44.467 --> 00:58:46.333
Why don't you run them
to the front desk?

1535
00:58:46.467 --> 00:58:47.734
The valet can steam
away any wrinkles

1536
00:58:47.867 --> 00:58:48.500
that they got in the ride.

1537
00:58:48.633 --> 00:58:49.567
They'll be ready in the morning.

1538
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:50.800
- Copy that.

1539
00:58:50.934 --> 00:58:51.433
- Oh. hey. hey. hey.
(Megan chuckles)

1540
00:58:51.567 --> 00:58:52.900
- Oh. right.

1541
00:58:53.033 --> 00:58:54.800
And put this on.

1542
00:58:54.934 --> 00:58:55.834
(Michelle chuckles)
- Okay.

1543
00:58:55.967 --> 00:58:57.000
- [Megan] Okay.

1544
00:58:57.967 --> 00:58:59.667
What do we have here?
- Okay.

1545
00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.900
It's all chilled. ready to go.

1546
00:59:02.033 --> 00:59:03.867
- Hey. you guys go
ahead. I'll catch up.

1547
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:04.967
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1548
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.300
Just make me a plate.

1549
00:59:06.433 --> 00:59:07.934
All the good stuff goes fast.

1550
00:59:09.367 --> 00:59:11.033
Quick question. does the name

1551
00:59:11.166 --> 00:59:13.567
Aldera Creek mean
anything to you?

1552
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.033
- No.

1553
00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:19.333
- I tell you what.
I'll write it down

1554
00:59:19.467 --> 00:59:21.533
in case you change your mind.

1555
00:59:21.667 --> 00:59:23.667
Alderra...

1556
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.667
- It's just one R.

1557
00:59:27.667 --> 00:59:28.734
(Daniel sighs)

1558
00:59:28.867 --> 00:59:29.867
- So you do know it.

1559
00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.900
- Look. I'll tell you the
same thing that I told Ben.

1560
00:59:34.033 --> 00:59:36.400
it was on one of the mailboxes
behind the front desk.

1561
00:59:36.533 --> 00:59:37.900
way back when I was a bellhop.

1562
00:59:38.033 --> 00:59:39.500
- And now it's gone?

1563
00:59:39.633 --> 00:59:41.800
- Far as I know. they
haven't gotten mail in years.

1564
00:59:41.934 --> 00:59:42.934
- Huh.

1565
00:59:44.934 --> 00:59:46.867
Something about this name...

1566
00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.367
Mm.

1567
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.066
Thanks.

1568
00:59:53.033 --> 00:59:55.166
- Okay. people.
who's ready to play?!

1569
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:57.667
(guests cheering)

1570
00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.200
Welcome to Bride & Groom Trivia.

1571
01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:02.000
(guests cheering)

1572
01:00:02.133 --> 01:00:04.834
The event we've all
been waiting for!

1573
01:00:04.967 --> 01:00:06.066
Ooh. except for the
one tomorrow night.

1574
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.900
- Right.
(guests laughing)

1575
01:00:08.033 --> 01:00:09.500
- Tonight. we will answer

1576
01:00:09.633 --> 01:00:12.133
the question that
all couples face:

1577
01:00:12.266 --> 01:00:14.800
How well do we know each
other. and who is right.

1578
01:00:14.934 --> 01:00:16.667
- Oh. I think we all
know the answer to that.

1579
01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.834
- Oh. we know who
talks a big game.

1580
01:00:18.967 --> 01:00:20.400
- And everyone. you're
more than welcome

1581
01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:22.133
to lay down the smack.
(guests laughing)

1582
01:00:22.266 --> 01:00:22.900
- Remember. you two
have to be in love

1583
01:00:23.033 --> 01:00:25.400
in the morning. so fight fair.

1584
01:00:25.533 --> 01:00:27.734
(guests laughing)
Okay. multiple choice:

1585
01:00:27.867 --> 01:00:30.967
What was Ben's most endearing
secret as a teenager?

1586
01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.400
A. loved polka music;

1587
01:00:33.533 --> 01:00:36.834
B. ate the same thing
for lunch every day;

1588
01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.800
or C. frosted tips.

1589
01:00:39.934 --> 01:00:43.200
Oh. and remember. all or
none are always on the table.

1590
01:00:43.333 --> 01:00:44.700
- None of the above.

1591
01:00:44.834 --> 01:00:45.800
If any of those were
true. I would know.

1592
01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:47.867
- Mm-hm.
- Sean would've told me.

1593
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.800
(guests laughing)
- Mm.

1594
01:00:49.934 --> 01:00:51.834
- You wanna deliver
the bad news?

1595
01:00:51.967 --> 01:00:53.967
- Actually. it's C.

1596
01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.467
I swore Sean to secrecy.

1597
01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.700
(guests laughing)
- Of course.

1598
01:00:56.834 --> 01:00:57.734
Really?
- What?

1599
01:00:57.867 --> 01:00:58.834
- Frosted tips?

1600
01:00:58.967 --> 01:01:00.433
- Why can't I remember that?

1601
01:01:00.567 --> 01:01:02.066
- Well. you might've
thought they were natural.

1602
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:02.967
I knew how to blend them.

1603
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.467
- Oh.
- Oh.

1604
01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.400
- Wow.
- I don't believe that.

1605
01:01:06.533 --> 01:01:08.033
- That's negative
one for Team Bride.

1606
01:01:08.166 --> 01:01:09.934
- But it was well
worth the intel.

1607
01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:11.633
(guests laughing)
- Yes.

1608
01:01:11.767 --> 01:01:12.734
- Okay. moving on.

1609
01:01:12.867 --> 01:01:15.967
As a little girl. Cara
spent most of her time doing

1610
01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:21.100
A. daydreaming; B.
writing; or C. dancing.

1611
01:01:21.667 --> 01:01:23.633
- Easy. A. daydreaming.

1612
01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:26.200
Cara spins everything
into a mystery.

1613
01:01:26.333 --> 01:01:27.433
- Writing.
- No!

1614
01:01:27.567 --> 01:01:28.200
(guests laughing)

1615
01:01:28.333 --> 01:01:30.100
- And I still have her journals.

1616
01:01:30.233 --> 01:01:31.900
- I thought it was too obvious.

1617
01:01:32.033 --> 01:01:33.533
- That's a point for Team Bride!

1618
01:01:33.667 --> 01:01:36.400
(guests cheering)

1619
01:01:39.033 --> 01:01:39.867
- [Daniel] Oh. hey. Ms. Reneau.

1620
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:40.800
Sounds like fun in there.

1621
01:01:40.934 --> 01:01:42.133
- Yeah. it's halftime.

1622
01:01:42.266 --> 01:01:43.934
Don't tell me you've got more?

1623
01:01:44.066 --> 01:01:46.066
- Oh. just some
finishing touches.

1624
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.166
- Oh.

1625
01:01:47.867 --> 01:01:50.066
Did you do something to this?

1626
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.567
It looks different.

1627
01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.767
- I replaced that
dusty old glass.

1628
01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.800
It's a miracle you could read
anything through it before.

1629
01:01:56.934 --> 01:01:57.667
- Well. apparently. I couldn't.

1630
01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.166
I thought the date
on this was 1948.

1631
01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:04.000
- The writer crosses
their sevens.

1632
01:02:04.133 --> 01:02:05.967
It's easy to confuse.

1633
01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:06.834
- Huh.

1634
01:02:06.967 --> 01:02:09.467
So this was actually
written in 1978.

1635
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.333
- Mysteries of Clara Lake.

1636
01:02:11.467 --> 01:02:12.667
- Hm.

1637
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.000
- That reminds me. I
mentioned Aldera Creek

1638
01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:17.433
to the guy who sorts the mail.

1639
01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.266
He said they still get
junk mail sometimes.

1640
01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.133
In fact. some came
for them this week.

1641
01:02:22.266 --> 01:02:24.100
- Excuse me.
- Oh. one sec.

1642
01:02:24.233 --> 01:02:24.934
Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1643
01:02:25.066 --> 01:02:27.033
- Yeah. sorry.
- How can I help you?

1644
01:02:27.166 --> 01:02:28.200
- [Man] Thanks.

1645
01:02:28.333 --> 01:02:30.200
Yeah. I was wondering
if you could...

1646
01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.133
(camera snapping)

1647
01:02:35.266 --> 01:02:36.033
- [Daniel] Right. yes.

1648
01:02:36.166 --> 01:02:38.133
Check out is actually at 11.

1649
01:02:38.266 --> 01:02:43.200
- And with a score of 12 to
10. the winner is Team Bride!

1650
01:02:44.166 --> 01:02:45.000
(guests cheering)

1651
01:02:45.133 --> 01:02:46.200
- Yes.

1652
01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:47.967
- Okay. everyone. stay warm.

1653
01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.133
and we'll see you all tomorrow

1654
01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:50.533
at the chalet for the big event.

1655
01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:55.200
- Woo!
(guests cheering)

1656
01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:56.834
- I'm not gonna
say it was rigged.

1657
01:02:56.967 --> 01:02:59.300
but there were a lot of
questions about boy bands.

1658
01:02:59.433 --> 01:03:02.767
Not to mention that Team Bride
must've been highly confident

1659
01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.000
to have the trophy
engraved in advance.

1660
01:03:05.133 --> 01:03:07.934
- Or we had two made.

1661
01:03:08.066 --> 01:03:09.000
(Ben chuckles)

1662
01:03:09.133 --> 01:03:11.233
- Can't out-detective the
mystery writer. can I?

1663
01:03:11.367 --> 01:03:15.033
- No. you can't. Actually.
I notice everything.

1664
01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:18.166
Like. when you said you
were busy with Camp Snow.

1665
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.033
but the season closed yesterday.

1666
01:03:21.166 --> 01:03:22.867
What's really going on. Ben?

1667
01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:26.200
- Let's go someplace quiet.

1668
01:03:27.633 --> 01:03:30.100
(gentle music)

1669
01:03:31.467 --> 01:03:32.567
So that's where I'm at.

1670
01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:33.834
(Ben sighs)

1671
01:03:33.967 --> 01:03:35.834
Trying to get in touch
with Aldera Creek.

1672
01:03:35.967 --> 01:03:39.100
but. so far. radio silence.

1673
01:03:40.367 --> 01:03:41.900
- Well. thanks for telling me.

1674
01:03:42.033 --> 01:03:44.500
I just wish you
had told me sooner.

1675
01:03:44.633 --> 01:03:46.066
- I was trying to
wait for the story

1676
01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.900
to have a happily ever after.

1677
01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:49.734
Saving this place. for us.

1678
01:03:49.867 --> 01:03:53.033
for Camp Snow. for
future generations.

1679
01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:55.333
that would've been
the next chapter.

1680
01:03:55.467 --> 01:03:58.567
But unless I can find this
shareholder. it's a no-go.

1681
01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.266
- Well. what if I could help?

1682
01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.800
- How?

1683
01:04:01.934 --> 01:04:03.567
- Well. after you mentioned
the name Aldera Creek.

1684
01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.266
I asked around.

1685
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.934
You know that they
used to have a P.O. box

1686
01:04:07.066 --> 01:04:07.967
here at the Lodge...

1687
01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.800
- Yeah. but Daniel
said they hadn't gotten

1688
01:04:09.934 --> 01:04:11.100
any letters in years.

1689
01:04:11.233 --> 01:04:14.967
- No letters. but what they
do get reveals their identity.

1690
01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.367
Junk mail.

1691
01:04:32.934 --> 01:04:33.700
- Hi.

1692
01:04:34.433 --> 01:04:36.166
That sounded like fun in there.

1693
01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.100
- It's quite the ramp up
for our big day tomorrow.

1694
01:04:38.233 --> 01:04:40.500
- Indeed. you two
had better rest up.

1695
01:04:40.633 --> 01:04:42.300
- First. I had a
question for you.

1696
01:04:42.433 --> 01:04:44.000
- About the new book?

1697
01:04:44.133 --> 01:04:45.533
- Not exactly.

1698
01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:49.867
What do you know about the
Aldera Creek Corporation?

1699
01:04:50.567 --> 01:04:52.200
- What do you know about it?

1700
01:04:52.333 --> 01:04:55.867
- Well. I know that their
sheet music catalogs

1701
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.467
still come to the hotel.

1702
01:04:59.967 --> 01:05:01.433
Aldera Creek. it's you.

1703
01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:05.166
- I'm gonna tell you
what I told Weatherly.

1704
01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.100
I'm not interested in selling.

1705
01:05:07.233 --> 01:05:08.266
- Okay. but you should know.

1706
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.200
this isn't just
another property to me.

1707
01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.900
My dad taught me
to snowboard here.

1708
01:05:15.033 --> 01:05:17.934
I went to Camp Snow.
and it belongs here.

1709
01:05:18.066 --> 01:05:20.066
I met Cara here.

1710
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.066
Clara Lake is more than
just an investment to me.

1711
01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.066
To me. it's like home.

1712
01:05:26.133 --> 01:05:29.000
And if I'm in charge. I'll
make sure it stays that way

1713
01:05:29.133 --> 01:05:30.433
for everyone who loves it.

1714
01:05:30.567 --> 01:05:33.200
- It's always felt like
home to me too. Always.

1715
01:05:34.633 --> 01:05:36.967
- You're Max and Clara's
daughter. aren't you?

1716
01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:41.066
- Goldie's a nickname I
picked up along the way.

1717
01:05:42.133 --> 01:05:44.633
My given name. same as my
mother's: Clara Deeker.

1718
01:05:46.133 --> 01:05:48.367
- Same letters as Aldera Creek.

1719
01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.467
It's an anagram.

1720
01:05:51.633 --> 01:05:54.200
- She's good.
(Clara chuckles)

1721
01:05:54.333 --> 01:05:56.200
- But what about
the breakup letter?

1722
01:05:56.333 --> 01:06:00.133
- Well. in 1977. I did go
through a difficult breakup.

1723
01:06:00.266 --> 01:06:02.300
And my mother. the other
Clara. wrote the note.

1724
01:06:02.433 --> 01:06:03.633
She was right.

1725
01:06:03.767 --> 01:06:05.767
The very next month. I
met my future husband.

1726
01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.867
- So the M was for Mom. not Max.

1727
01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:13.133
But if your parents were
together all that time.

1728
01:06:13.266 --> 01:06:14.967
why weren't there
any pictures of them?

1729
01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.000
- They were private people

1730
01:06:16.133 --> 01:06:19.100
at a time when you didn't
need constant photos

1731
01:06:19.233 --> 01:06:21.433
and status updates to
prove you were in love.

1732
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.367
But they were. oh. very much so.

1733
01:06:27.767 --> 01:06:29.233
You kind of remind me of them.

1734
01:06:29.367 --> 01:06:31.166
(Ben chuckles)
Quite the duo.

1735
01:06:34.367 --> 01:06:37.233
- Why didn't you just tell
me about your parents?

1736
01:06:37.367 --> 01:06:39.000
- I love a good story.

1737
01:06:39.133 --> 01:06:41.600
and yours was way better
than the real one.

1738
01:06:41.734 --> 01:06:44.000
(Clara chuckles)
(Cara chuckles)

1739
01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:45.633
You should write that book.

1740
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.133
(Megan yawns)

1741
01:06:57.266 --> 01:07:01.367
- Uh-oh. you haven't gotten
the crafting bug too. have you?

1742
01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.967
- No. This is my mom's dress.

1743
01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:07.300
My dad suggested I sew
a piece of it into mine.

1744
01:07:07.433 --> 01:07:10.033
You know. to keep her close.

1745
01:07:10.166 --> 01:07:12.900
- That's a wonderful
way to honor her. Cara.

1746
01:07:13.033 --> 01:07:15.533
And fitting. seeing as how
she taught us how to sew.

1747
01:07:15.667 --> 01:07:17.033
- Well. you took to
it better than I did.

1748
01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:19.233
(Megan laughs)
I could never quite

1749
01:07:19.367 --> 01:07:20.467
get it down.

1750
01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.500
Oop.
- Here. let me.

1751
01:07:22.633 --> 01:07:23.400
- Okay.

1752
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.133
Still trying to keep
your mind off Sean?

1753
01:07:27.266 --> 01:07:28.233
- Yup.

1754
01:07:28.367 --> 01:07:29.734
That's what
craftopia's all about.

1755
01:07:29.867 --> 01:07:30.667
- I know.

1756
01:07:31.633 --> 01:07:34.633
That's why I left you to it.

1757
01:07:34.767 --> 01:07:35.600
But you know what?

1758
01:07:36.333 --> 01:07:38.367
It's enough of this for tonight.

1759
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.066
You need your rest.

1760
01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.000
- I do.
- Let's go.

1761
01:07:42.133 --> 01:07:42.900
- Okay.

1762
01:07:44.467 --> 01:07:45.233
(cellphone chimes)
(cellphone buzzes)

1763
01:07:45.367 --> 01:07:46.233
Oh. my phone. I've
been looking for it.

1764
01:07:46.367 --> 01:07:47.500
- Oh. no. no. no. no.

1765
01:07:47.633 --> 01:07:48.800
- No. no. it could
be work. it could be-

1766
01:07:48.934 --> 01:07:50.734
- Whoever it is. it can
wait till the morning.

1767
01:07:50.867 --> 01:07:51.734
- [Megan] Yeah. you're right.

1768
01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:53.233
(Cara chuckles)
(Megan chuckles)

1769
01:07:53.367 --> 01:07:54.100
- [Cara] There she is.

1770
01:07:54.233 --> 01:07:58.200
(cellphone chimes)
(cellphone buzzes)

1771
01:07:58.333 --> 01:08:03.400
(alarm ringing)
(Cara groaning)

1772
01:08:04.166 --> 01:08:05.800
- Wake up. Cara.

1773
01:08:05.934 --> 01:08:07.300
It's your special day!

1774
01:08:07.433 --> 01:08:09.066
(Megan chuckles)

1775
01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:14.166
(curtains rustling)
(winds blowing)

1776
01:08:17.233 --> 01:08:20.300
On second thought. why
don't you sleep in?

1777
01:08:22.033 --> 01:08:24.600
(Megan exhales)

1778
01:08:26.266 --> 01:08:27.367
- Mm.

1779
01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.233
(people chattering)

1780
01:08:29.367 --> 01:08:30.400
- The snow.
- I know.

1781
01:08:30.533 --> 01:08:31.734
- What are we gonna do?

1782
01:08:31.867 --> 01:08:32.633
- Okay. they get this
all the time up here.

1783
01:08:32.767 --> 01:08:33.967
I'm sure Daniel has a plan.

1784
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.133
- Make sure that all the
guests are comfortable.

1785
01:08:35.266 --> 01:08:38.000
And then we'll let them know
as soon as the roads open.

1786
01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.767
- What if he doesn't?

1787
01:08:43.333 --> 01:08:44.100
- Oh. boy. Okay.

1788
01:08:44.233 --> 01:08:45.000
Come on.

1789
01:08:47.867 --> 01:08:49.100
It was a freak storm.

1790
01:08:49.233 --> 01:08:51.900
Way more snow than
anyone anticipated
for this time of year.

1791
01:08:52.033 --> 01:08:54.867
- Until further notice. the
roads from Seattle are closed.

1792
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.767
- But the good news is the
chalet was dressed yesterday.

1793
01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.300
and the flowers
arrived last night.

1794
01:08:59.433 --> 01:09:02.300
- The photographer's local.
Hair and makeup is too.

1795
01:09:02.433 --> 01:09:03.633
- So everything's here?

1796
01:09:03.767 --> 01:09:05.467
- Well. not everything.

1797
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.000
- Just tell me. Meg.
No sugarcoating.

1798
01:09:08.133 --> 01:09:10.867
- No cake. no DJ. no
shrimp. no Chateaubriand.

1799
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.100
- So much for surf and turf.

1800
01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:14.433
- I know it's a lot to take in.

1801
01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.934
and everyone will get
it if you wanna wait.

1802
01:09:17.066 --> 01:09:19.967
- But if you're game. we have
a way we can make it work.

1803
01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:23.333
- It may not be exactly
what you had in mind...

1804
01:09:23.467 --> 01:09:25.500
- But at the end of the
day. it's your call.

1805
01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.266
- This is where it all started.

1806
01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:35.834
- I've waited long enough.

1807
01:09:35.967 --> 01:09:37.800
- And this is where
I'm getting married.

1808
01:09:37.934 --> 01:09:39.300
- I'm getting married today.

1809
01:09:39.433 --> 01:09:40.467
- Yay!

1810
01:09:41.433 --> 01:09:43.333
(both laughing)

1811
01:09:43.467 --> 01:09:46.166
(Megan chuckles)

1812
01:09:49.233 --> 01:09:51.834
- Exactly how much
bratwurst do you have?

1813
01:09:51.967 --> 01:09:53.367
'Cause we're gonna need it.

1814
01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.867
- Word is you've DJ'd a little?

1815
01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.834
- If you're asking if I'm
down to officiate and DJ.

1816
01:09:59.967 --> 01:10:00.734
you bet I am.

1817
01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:05.400
- I'm thinking fondue
pots at every table.

1818
01:10:09.834 --> 01:10:12.867
- These'll do the trick.

1819
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.300
What icings do you have?

1820
01:10:14.433 --> 01:10:15.867
(group laughing)
- Exactly.

1821
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.166
- Mm.

1822
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.600
Okay. well. if you
will excuse me.

1823
01:10:18.734 --> 01:10:21.967
I have a ceremony and
a set list to go over.

1824
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.066
- Thank you.

1825
01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.967
Oh. hey. Are we missing a troop?

1826
01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.800
Zoey's supposed to be next.

1827
01:10:27.934 --> 01:10:30.300
- Oh. yeah. I should
check in on her.

1828
01:10:30.433 --> 01:10:31.967
- [Ben] Hey. come on in.

1829
01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.800
- Yeah. the ladies seem like
they're busy for some reason.

1830
01:10:34.934 --> 01:10:37.600
so I just thought
I'd check in on you.

1831
01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:38.967
- It's much appreciated.

1832
01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:40.333
although my getting
ready routine today

1833
01:10:40.467 --> 01:10:42.200
is far less eventful.

1834
01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:45.433
Just gotta knot my tie.
and it's smooth sailing.

1835
01:10:45.567 --> 01:10:47.367
- Ah. You feeling nervous. Ben?

1836
01:10:49.066 --> 01:10:50.433
- About marrying your daughter?

1837
01:10:50.567 --> 01:10:51.934
Not at all.

1838
01:10:52.066 --> 01:10:53.333
Are you?

1839
01:10:53.467 --> 01:10:54.467
- Well. should I be?

1840
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.533
- Well. what would
put you at ease?

1841
01:11:00.467 --> 01:11:02.300
- If you answered
me one question.

1842
01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.100
Do you promise to do
right by my little girl?

1843
01:11:08.633 --> 01:11:09.400
- Yeah. I do.

1844
01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.834
- Well. that's all that matters.

1845
01:11:12.967 --> 01:11:13.700
(Ray chuckles)

1846
01:11:13.834 --> 01:11:16.433
(Ben chuckles)

1847
01:11:16.567 --> 01:11:19.567
Listen. I know your dad passed.

1848
01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:22.533
and I bet he was a great dad.

1849
01:11:24.033 --> 01:11:27.367
Well. if you ever need
some advice. I'm around.

1850
01:11:29.233 --> 01:11:30.033
- Thanks. Ray.

1851
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.767
That means a lot.

1852
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.166
- Come here.

1853
01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.266
(both chuckling)

1854
01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.934
(hand patting)

1855
01:11:38.066 --> 01:11:42.033
Well. I gotta get
changed. I got this thing.

1856
01:11:42.166 --> 01:11:42.900
- Right.

1857
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:49.367
(Megan sighs)

1858
01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.500
- Ah. there it is.

1859
01:11:51.633 --> 01:11:52.266
(hand knocking)

1860
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.200
Oh.

1861
01:11:55.567 --> 01:11:57.900
Ah. I was just
about to text you.

1862
01:11:58.033 --> 01:11:59.567
- Steamed and ready!

1863
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:01.533
- Great. Let me
help you with that.

1864
01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.500
(Megan sighs)

1865
01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.133
The wedding dress is purple.

1866
01:12:15.266 --> 01:12:16.834
- Technically. moonflower.

1867
01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.834
- And mine is white?

1868
01:12:29.967 --> 01:12:31.100
- Moonstone.

1869
01:12:35.633 --> 01:12:39.266
- Aria in moonstone.
Adella in moonflower.

1870
01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.600
Or was it Aria in
moonflower and...

1871
01:12:43.667 --> 01:12:46.066
Why don't they just call
these colors by their names?

1872
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.300
- Welcome to weddings.

1873
01:12:49.633 --> 01:12:50.734
I mean. I thought
something might be off.

1874
01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:52.433
I sent you the picture.

1875
01:12:52.567 --> 01:12:53.567
- What pictures?

1876
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.667
- The pictures I texted.

1877
01:12:57.767 --> 01:13:01.033
(cellphone chiming)

1878
01:13:01.166 --> 01:13:03.266
- Oh. no.
- What'd I miss?

1879
01:13:09.867 --> 01:13:10.667
Guys?

1880
01:13:16.133 --> 01:13:18.033
- [Zoey] I'm so. so sorry.

1881
01:13:18.166 --> 01:13:19.667
- Don't worry. Zoey.
we'll figure it out.

1882
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.300
Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1883
01:13:21.433 --> 01:13:22.567
- I'm okay. You okay?

1884
01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:25.533
Actually. I'm a little parched.

1885
01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:27.533
could you maybe grab
me something to drink?

1886
01:13:27.667 --> 01:13:29.066
- Yeah. do you want apple juice.

1887
01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.700
orange juice. grape juice...

1888
01:13:31.834 --> 01:13:33.867
(Cara groans)

1889
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
- Okay. we will think
of something. right?

1890
01:13:36.133 --> 01:13:37.367
- Yep. yep. Yeah.

1891
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.033
- We will think of something.

1892
01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:39.800
- Yes.

1893
01:13:39.934 --> 01:13:40.667
- Are you thinking of something?

1894
01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.900
- No.
- Okay.

1895
01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:44.400
- I'm so sorry. This
is all my fault.

1896
01:13:44.533 --> 01:13:45.834
I let down my guard
down for one second

1897
01:13:45.967 --> 01:13:47.166
and now the dress is purple and-

1898
01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:49.400
- No. no. You brought
backups for everything.

1899
01:13:49.533 --> 01:13:50.667
- Yes. yes.

1900
01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:51.633
- Did you bring
something for this?

1901
01:13:51.767 --> 01:13:53.867
- No.
- Okay. didn't think so.

1902
01:13:55.433 --> 01:13:57.367
(Cara sighs)

1903
01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:01.433
But someone else did.
- Someone else did.

1904
01:14:01.567 --> 01:14:03.633
- Yeah. well. one
thing is for sure.

1905
01:14:03.767 --> 01:14:05.967
these cufflinks fit perfectly.

1906
01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.567
- I took a wild
guess at your size.

1907
01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.233
(Ben chuckles)

1908
01:14:09.367 --> 01:14:11.600
- You know. with all
the chaos yesterday.

1909
01:14:11.734 --> 01:14:14.567
I haven't had the
chance to say thank you.

1910
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.567
You have been the
best remote best man

1911
01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:19.066
I could've possibly hoped for.

1912
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.400
- I suggest you take notes.

1913
01:14:22.533 --> 01:14:24.967
The roles may be reversed
sooner than you think.

1914
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.233
- Really?

1915
01:14:27.367 --> 01:14:29.834
(gentle music)

1916
01:14:58.033 --> 01:14:59.233
- You look good.

1917
01:14:59.367 --> 01:15:00.300
You ready?

1918
01:15:00.433 --> 01:15:01.367
- I'm ready.
(Zoey sighs)

1919
01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.000
- Mom and Dad would be so proud.

1920
01:15:07.467 --> 01:15:09.734
(Cara sighs)

1921
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.000
- Wow.

1922
01:15:14.133 --> 01:15:16.567
(Ray chuckles)

1923
01:15:17.734 --> 01:15:18.967
You're wearing Mum's...

1924
01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.533
- Mom came to the rescue.

1925
01:15:20.667 --> 01:15:22.166
(Cara chuckles)

1926
01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.533
It's almost like
she's here with us.

1927
01:15:24.667 --> 01:15:26.500
- She's always with us.

1928
01:15:26.633 --> 01:15:29.166
(Cara sighs)

1929
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.433
I wasn't gonna cry.

1930
01:15:31.567 --> 01:15:35.100
- I told you. happy
tears are always welcome.

1931
01:15:35.233 --> 01:15:36.333
(Ray chuckles)

1932
01:15:36.467 --> 01:15:37.266
- Okay.

1933
01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.000
- You won't be the only one.

1934
01:15:39.133 --> 01:15:41.500
(Ray chuckles)

1935
01:15:41.633 --> 01:15:42.967
(Cara sighs)
- You ready?

1936
01:15:45.734 --> 01:15:48.467
(Cara chuckles)

1937
01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:51.133
Here we go.

1938
01:15:51.266 --> 01:15:53.333
(Cara sighs)

1939
01:15:53.467 --> 01:15:55.967
(gentle music)

1940
01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:13.200
(camera snaps)

1941
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.533
- We are gathered here today

1942
01:16:31.667 --> 01:16:33.700
to witness Ben and Cara take

1943
01:16:33.834 --> 01:16:38.066
the ultimate leap
of faith: marriage.

1944
01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.400
And it's more than just a vows.

1945
01:16:40.533 --> 01:16:43.200
it's the choice to trust
the person you love.

1946
01:16:43.333 --> 01:16:46.166
to take their hand and
leap into the future.

1947
01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:48.333
not knowing what comes next.

1948
01:16:48.467 --> 01:16:51.066
And we hope for sunny days.

1949
01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.834
but we know the rain. and snow-

1950
01:16:53.967 --> 01:16:55.767
(all laughing)

1951
01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:56.867
- Will fall.

1952
01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.567
But that's life.

1953
01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.467
Ben. your vows?

1954
01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.467
- I think today's snowstorm

1955
01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.333
brought my first
lesson of marriage.

1956
01:17:06.266 --> 01:17:08.867
We can't control what
happens out there.

1957
01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:13.166
Things we take for
granted can disappear

1958
01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.467
in the blink of an eye.

1959
01:17:15.467 --> 01:17:18.734
But I know that it's easier
to face life's hiccups

1960
01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:20.000
when we face them together.

1961
01:17:21.233 --> 01:17:22.100
As a team.

1962
01:17:26.734 --> 01:17:30.667
- My dad's a detective.
I'm a mystery writer.

1963
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.333
Questioning everything
is second nature?

1964
01:17:36.133 --> 01:17:37.200
But the one thing I've learned

1965
01:17:37.333 --> 01:17:39.300
I never have to question
is your love. Ben.

1966
01:17:40.667 --> 01:17:42.700
Thank you for everything
you've shared with me.

1967
01:17:42.834 --> 01:17:44.467
and everything you will share.

1968
01:17:45.767 --> 01:17:47.166
I'll always be ready to listen.

1969
01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.567
- By the power vested in me.

1970
01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.834
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1971
01:18:06.967 --> 01:18:08.066
You may kiss the bride.

1972
01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.567
(guests cheering)

1973
01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.900
(upbeat music)

1974
01:18:26.033 --> 01:18:29.133
Okay. everyone.
who's ready to dance?

1975
01:18:37.033 --> 01:18:42.033
♪ I feel so close to you right
now. it's a force field ♪

1976
01:18:44.734 --> 01:18:49.633
♪ I wear my heart upon my
sleeve. like a big deal ♪

1977
01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:56.900
♪ Your love pours down on me.
surround me like a waterfall ♪

1978
01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.066
- [Cara] Ready?

1979
01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.767
- [Group] One.

1980
01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:04.934
Two.

1981
01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.166
Three!

1982
01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:11.467
(all cheering)

1983
01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.667
- Did you hear that?
- Did you see that?

1984
01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.734
(Cara laughs)
- Yes. I did.

1985
01:19:14.867 --> 01:19:19.500
(Megan laughs)
(Zoey laughs)

1986
01:19:19.633 --> 01:19:22.767
(glasses clinking)

1987
01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:24.467
- So no more secrets?

1988
01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.667
- Ever?

1989
01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.767
No. I'm just kidding.
(Cara chuckles)

1990
01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:28.567
No more secrets.

1991
01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.834
I promise.

1992
01:19:29.967 --> 01:19:31.500
- Can I put that to the test?

1993
01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:33.266
- Mm-hm.

1994
01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:34.700
- What's Secret Squirrel?

1995
01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:38.266
- That's Sean's nickname for me.

1996
01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:41.400
Apparently. I wasn't
always the most open book.

1997
01:19:41.533 --> 01:19:43.100
even to my best friend.

1998
01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:46.934
What?

1999
01:19:47.734 --> 01:19:49.667
- I'm just trying
to picture you.

2000
01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.567
This secretive.
frosty-tipped snowboarder.

2001
01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:54.967
- Subtle frosted tips.

2002
01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:56.800
- Right. of course.

2003
01:19:56.934 --> 01:19:59.300
(Cara laughs)

2004
01:20:07.033 --> 01:20:08.834
- Can I get
everyone's attention?

2005
01:20:09.767 --> 01:20:12.567
And now. it's time
to say our goodbyes.

2006
01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.734
and let the happy couple

2007
01:20:14.867 --> 01:20:16.900
finally have the
chalet to themselves.

2008
01:20:17.033 --> 01:20:18.934
(guests laughing)

2009
01:20:19.066 --> 01:20:21.800
(gentle music)

2010
01:20:28.233 --> 01:20:30.600
- So Greta realizes the
anagrams are leading her

2011
01:20:30.734 --> 01:20:33.734
to the one place even
the CIA can't find Brad.

2012
01:20:33.867 --> 01:20:36.066
his safe haven cabin.

2013
01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.233
So when she drives up. he's
chopping wood. waiting for her.

2014
01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:43.433
And he says. in his wry smile.
"What took you so long?"

2015
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.233
- [Renee] I love it.

2016
01:20:49.367 --> 01:20:50.734
I'm laughing. I'm crying.

2017
01:20:50.867 --> 01:20:52.000
- [Cara] You are?

2018
01:20:52.133 --> 01:20:53.333
- [Renee] You did
it again. Cara.

2019
01:20:53.467 --> 01:20:55.066
I gotta run. but I
think you nailed it.

2020
01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.133
Now go enjoy your Sunday.

2021
01:20:57.266 --> 01:20:58.734
- Amazing. Thank you.

2022
01:20:58.867 --> 01:20:59.800
Oh.

2023
01:20:59.934 --> 01:21:01.200
- That was great.

2024
01:21:01.333 --> 01:21:02.633
- And. thankfully. over.

2025
01:21:02.767 --> 01:21:05.400
because I cannot
waste one more minute

2026
01:21:05.533 --> 01:21:07.000
of our one-day honeymoon.

2027
01:21:07.133 --> 01:21:08.300
(glasses clinking)
(Cara chuckles)

2028
01:21:08.433 --> 01:21:11.000
(hand knocking)

2029
01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.033
- Forgive me. but this arrived.

2030
01:21:14.166 --> 01:21:16.734
And after yesterday.
well. it seemed important.

2031
01:21:16.867 --> 01:21:18.533
- Thanks. Daniel.

2032
01:21:18.667 --> 01:21:20.867
- Ooh. Cherington Jewelers.

2033
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.166
Another set of cufflinks?

2034
01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:23.867
- This might take
more than a minute.

2035
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.500
- Well. for a cause this good?

2036
01:21:25.633 --> 01:21:26.834
I'll make an exception.

2037
01:21:31.633 --> 01:21:34.033
(g)

2038
01:21:36.633 --> 01:21:39.000
(door opens)

2039
01:21:39.133 --> 01:21:40.633
- Hey.

2040
01:21:40.767 --> 01:21:41.867
It gets better every time.

2041
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.734
What are you doing here?

2042
01:21:43.867 --> 01:21:44.867
- It's a gorgeous day.

2043
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.033
It'd be tragic not to hit
the slopes. don't you think?

2044
01:21:47.867 --> 01:21:48.800
Why the face?

2045
01:21:48.934 --> 01:21:50.500
- It's your honeymoon.

2046
01:21:50.633 --> 01:21:52.667
- I told you. this weekend
is about spending time

2047
01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.000
with everyone I love.

2048
01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.000
I promise. this is my last
request of you as maid of honor.

2049
01:21:59.133 --> 01:22:00.734
- Cara. I'm sure Ben-

2050
01:22:00.867 --> 01:22:02.300
- Thought this was a great idea.

2051
01:22:02.433 --> 01:22:03.467
No more excuses.

2052
01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.367
Go get changed.
(Megan chuckles)

2053
01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.533
- Okay.

2054
01:22:06.667 --> 01:22:09.300
(both chuckling)

2055
01:22:11.033 --> 01:22:12.800
Doesn't the mountain
look empty to you?

2056
01:22:12.934 --> 01:22:14.633
- [Cara] Oh. right. That.

2057
01:22:14.767 --> 01:22:16.133
Guess being the soon-to-be owner

2058
01:22:16.266 --> 01:22:18.800
of Clara Lake Resort
has its perks.

2059
01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:22.233
- Wait. what?
(Cara chuckles)

2060
01:22:22.367 --> 01:22:24.867
(Cara sighs)

2061
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:25.633
- How do I look?

2062
01:22:25.767 --> 01:22:26.900
- You look good. buddy.

2063
01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:30.033
- Okay. I want to
triple-quadruple check.

2064
01:22:30.166 --> 01:22:30.834
you've got the ring?

2065
01:22:30.967 --> 01:22:32.200
- Yeah. Don't worry. it's here.

2066
01:22:32.333 --> 01:22:33.100
We gotta get it right this time.

2067
01:22:33.233 --> 01:22:34.700
we're out of cover stories.

2068
01:22:34.834 --> 01:22:36.567
- Okay. Oh. I see them.
they're coming up the lift.

2069
01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:37.400
(Michelle chuckles)

2070
01:22:37.533 --> 01:22:39.567
- Turns out that
Goldie was the key.

2071
01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:41.633
And once she heard Ben's
offer. she realized-

2072
01:22:41.767 --> 01:22:43.633
- That she couldn't refuse?

2073
01:22:43.767 --> 01:22:44.867
- Something like that.

2074
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.233
- So Camp Snow can stay?

2075
01:22:46.367 --> 01:22:48.700
- And Clara Lake
will stay the same.

2076
01:22:48.834 --> 01:22:50.734
- [Megan] Wow. and all
of this was going on.

2077
01:22:50.867 --> 01:22:52.066
you didn't think to
tell me because...

2078
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.867
- Well. it happened so fast.

2079
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.700
Not to mention. a lot happened
while you were DIY-ing.

2080
01:22:56.834 --> 01:22:58.567
- Yeah. I was pretty busy. huh?

2081
01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:00.500
(both laughing)

2082
01:23:00.633 --> 01:23:01.667
- Bar up.
- Yup.

2083
01:23:03.133 --> 01:23:03.900
- Woo-hoo.

2084
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.633
All right. let's make the
most of this fresh powder!

2085
01:23:07.767 --> 01:23:09.133
Ow!
- Oh. it's so good!

2086
01:23:09.266 --> 01:23:10.033
- Yeah!

2087
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.166
Hey!

2088
01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.066
- Hey.

2089
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.033
- What's all of this?

2090
01:23:28.166 --> 01:23:29.533
(Michelle chuckles)

2091
01:23:29.667 --> 01:23:32.867
(Cara chuckles)

2092
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:33.667
Oh!
- Ha ha.

2093
01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:34.934
- Sean. hi!

2094
01:23:35.066 --> 01:23:38.433
- Maybe it's weird. but it
felt right to do this up here.

2095
01:23:38.567 --> 01:23:40.967
After all. this is our spot.

2096
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.333
I started this speech
the other night.

2097
01:23:44.467 --> 01:23:47.834
so forgive me if
I repeat myself.

2098
01:23:47.967 --> 01:23:51.100
- I knew there was
something going on.

2099
01:23:51.233 --> 01:23:52.233
- Guilty as charged.

2100
01:23:53.133 --> 01:23:55.800
- Megan. when we
first started dating.

2101
01:23:55.934 --> 01:23:58.166
it felt like all
the puzzle pieces

2102
01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:00.667
finally started
to come together.

2103
01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.367
And now. being without you.

2104
01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.900
feels like a piece
of me is missing.

2105
01:24:06.033 --> 01:24:07.867
- I feel the same way.

2106
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.200
I love you.

2107
01:24:09.333 --> 01:24:10.500
- I love you too.

2108
01:24:10.633 --> 01:24:11.834
I love that we make
each other laugh.

2109
01:24:11.967 --> 01:24:13.667
I love that you always
ask me about my day.

2110
01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:14.934
even though nothing
special happens.

2111
01:24:15.066 --> 01:24:17.367
I love that we
believe in each other.

2112
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:19.734
I love that we like opposite
flavored jelly beans-

2113
01:24:19.867 --> 01:24:22.000
(group laughing)

2114
01:24:22.133 --> 01:24:23.934
Because we can split
the box perfectly.

2115
01:24:24.734 --> 01:24:26.400
For the record.
cinnamon is gross.

2116
01:24:26.533 --> 01:24:27.867
(group laughing)
- Hey!

2117
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.066
That means it's
just more for me.

2118
01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.834
(both laughing)

2119
01:24:30.967 --> 01:24:33.934
- Most of all. I love
you for your patience.

2120
01:24:35.967 --> 01:24:37.967
You knew this job
would take me away.

2121
01:24:40.066 --> 01:24:42.033
but you loved me
enough to wait for me.

2122
01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:45.100
But I'm not as patient as you.

2123
01:24:45.233 --> 01:24:47.767
I can't stand to spend
another moment apart.

2124
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:51.934
- Pretend I'm Sean.

2125
01:24:59.066 --> 01:25:01.467
- Okay.
(Michelle chuckles)

2126
01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.967
- Megan Marquart.
will you marry me?

2127
01:25:07.767 --> 01:25:08.533
- Yes.

2128
01:25:10.066 --> 01:25:11.467
- No. wait. What was that?

2129
01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.233
The first time was kinda
quiet. Could you say it again?

2130
01:25:14.367 --> 01:25:15.800
- Yes!

2131
01:25:15.934 --> 01:25:17.734
Yes. I will marry you!

2132
01:25:17.867 --> 01:25:19.166
(Cara laughs)
(Michelle laughs)

2133
01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.100
Oh. it's beautiful.

2134
01:25:21.233 --> 01:25:22.333
(Ben laughs)
- Yeah!

2135
01:25:22.467 --> 01:25:24.300
- Congratulations!
(Megan laughs)

2136
01:25:24.433 --> 01:25:26.333
- Oh!
- I'm so happy for you.

2137
01:25:26.467 --> 01:25:27.467
Oh!

2138
01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.100
(Michelle sighs)
(both laughing)

2139
01:25:31.233 --> 01:25:33.967
- You guys got married.
now I'm getting married.

2140
01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:35.734
- Best weekend ever.

2141
01:25:35.867 --> 01:25:37.600
- You said it.
(group laughing)

2142
01:25:37.734 --> 01:25:38.900
- You wanna go for a run?

2143
01:25:39.033 --> 01:25:39.767
- Absolutely.

2144
01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:42.467
Just don't run into
anyone. Please.

2145
01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.166
- Woo!
- Let's do it!

2146
01:25:45.133 --> 01:25:46.834
- [Ben] Well. it's all
downhill from here.

2147
01:25:46.967 --> 01:25:48.667
- [Cara] But it's
gonna be a great ride.

2148
01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:49.934
- Yeah!
- Woo!

2149
01:25:52.767 --> 01:25:54.000
(group laughing)

2150
01:25:54.133 --> 01:25:57.100
(group cheering)

2151
01:26:13.433 --> 01:26:16.100
(gentle music)
