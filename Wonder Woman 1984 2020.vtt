<i>Some days.
my childhood feels so very far away.</i>

3
00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:22.342
<i>And others.</i>

4
00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.592
<i>I can almost see it.</i>

5
00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:28.175
<i>The magical land of my youth.</i>

6
00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:33.633
<i>like a beautiful dream of when the
whole world felt like a promise</i>

7
00:00:33.717 --> 00:00:38.258
<i>and the lessons that lay ahead
yet unseen.</i>

8
00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:41.967
<i>Looking back.
I wish I'd listened.</i>

9
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.717
<i>Wish I'd watched more closely</i>

10
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.842
<i>and understood.</i>

11
00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:50.300
<i>But sometimes you can't see
what you're learning</i>

12
00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.508
<i>until you come out
the other side.</i>

13
00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:44.342
Come on!

14
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.467
Come on!

15
00:02:09.092 --> 00:02:10.133
Come on!

16
00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:47.758
I'm gonna miss out.

17
00:02:51.092 --> 00:02:52.842
I've seen this contest

18
00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:56.467
humble even the most
seasoned warriors. Diana.

19
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.258
I can do it.

20
00:02:59.175 --> 00:03:01.342
Just do your best.

21
00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:02.758
And remember.

22
00:03:02.842 --> 00:03:05.758
greatness is not
what you think.

23
00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:07.800
Pace yourself and watch.

24
00:09:18.217 --> 00:09:19.342
No!

25
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.008
No!

26
00:09:29.092 --> 00:09:30.467
That's not fair!

27
00:09:31.217 --> 00:09:32.342
No.

28
00:09:32.425 --> 00:09:34.217
No. But...

29
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.508
- You took the short path.
- But...

30
00:09:36.592 --> 00:09:38.133
- You cheated. Diana.
- No.

31
00:09:38.217 --> 00:09:39.175
But that...

32
00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:41.633
That is the truth.

33
00:09:41.717 --> 00:09:43.175
That is the only truth.

34
00:09:43.258 --> 00:09:45.342
and truth is all there is.

35
00:09:45.425 --> 00:09:46.800
But I would've won.
if you didn't...

36
00:09:46.883 --> 00:09:48.842
But you didn't.

37
00:09:48.925 --> 00:09:53.092
You cannot be the winner.
because you are not ready to win.

38
00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:55.133
and there is no shame in that.

39
00:09:57.258 --> 00:09:59.883
Only in knowing
the truth in your heart

40
00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:02.217
and not accepting it.

41
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.842
No true hero is born from lies.

42
00:10:11.717 --> 00:10:13.550
Your time will come. Diana.

43
00:10:13.633 --> 00:10:15.383
When?

44
00:10:16.758 --> 00:10:18.967
When you're ready.

45
00:10:20.133 --> 00:10:22.508
Look to the
Golden Warrior Asteria.

46
00:10:24.092 --> 00:10:27.217
She did not become a legend
out of haste.

47
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.092
She did it through
true acts of bravery.

48
00:10:31.175 --> 00:10:34.467
Like patience. diligence.

49
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.800
and the courage
to face the truth.

50
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.717
One day. you'll become
all that you dream of and more.

51
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.508
and everything
will be different.

52
00:10:51.592 --> 00:10:56.883
This world is not yet ready
for all that you will do.

53
00:11:20.342 --> 00:11:22.883
<i>Welcome to the future.</i>

54
00:11:22.967 --> 00:11:26.092
<i>Life is good.
but it can be better.</i>

55
00:11:26.175 --> 00:11:27.758
<i>And why shouldn't it be?</i>

56
00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:29.425
<i>Everything we've
ever dreamed about</i>

57
00:11:29.508 --> 00:11:31.425
<i>is right at our fingertips.</i>

58
00:11:31.508 --> 00:11:34.175
<i>But are you
reaping the rewards?</i>

59
00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:35.342
<i>Do you...</i>

60
00:11:35.425 --> 00:11:36.883
<i>...have it all?</i>

61
00:11:42.175 --> 00:11:43.217
Slow down. dude.

62
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.342
No way.

63
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.925
Dude!

64
00:12:00.008 --> 00:12:02.008
<i>Welcome to
Black Gold Cooperative.</i>

65
00:12:02.092 --> 00:12:03.883
- Oh. my gosh. Guys!
- <i>The first oil company</i>

66
00:12:03.967 --> 00:12:06.217
<i>run for the people.
by the people.</i>

67
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.717
<i>Think about finally having</i>

68
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.925
<i>everything you've
always wished for.</i>

69
00:12:10.008 --> 00:12:11.092
Let's go!

70
00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:12.675
Hey!

71
00:12:14.675 --> 00:12:16.008
<i>For a low monthly fee.</i>

72
00:12:16.092 --> 00:12:17.758
<i>you can own a piece</i>

73
00:12:17.842 --> 00:12:20.800
<i>of the most lucrative industry
in the world.</i>

74
00:12:20.883 --> 00:12:23.175
<i>And every time we strike gold.</i>

75
00:12:23.258 --> 00:12:25.133
- <i>you strike gold.</i>
- Oh!

76
00:12:33.217 --> 00:12:36.842
<i>No matter who you
are. no matter what you do.</i>

77
00:12:36.925 --> 00:12:39.758
<i>you deserve to have it all.</i>

78
00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:43.217
<i>Do you have everything
you've ever wanted?</i>

79
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.675
<i>Aren't you tired of
always wishing you had more?</i>

80
00:12:46.758 --> 00:12:49.092
- Hey. move it. It's my turn.
- <i>Join me today.</i>

81
00:12:49.175 --> 00:12:51.133
- Yes!
- <i>Operators are standing by.</i>

82
00:12:51.217 --> 00:12:55.383
<i>You don't need a pile of money or
some business degree to get started.</i>

83
00:12:55.467 --> 00:12:57.550
<i>You don't even have
to work hard for it.</i>

84
00:12:57.633 --> 00:12:59.550
Good morning.

85
00:12:59.633 --> 00:13:01.342
- Good morning.
- Don't even think about it.

86
00:13:01.425 --> 00:13:04.467
<i>At Black Gold
Cooperative. all you need</i>

87
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.217
<i>is to want it!</i>

88
00:13:10.258 --> 00:13:13.050
We get what we want.
and we go.

89
00:13:13.133 --> 00:13:15.592
- What do you want?
- None of this junk.

90
00:13:15.675 --> 00:13:17.550
Word is on the street

91
00:13:17.633 --> 00:13:20.050
you got a nice little black market
side business going on back there.

92
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.092
If you don't tell.
we won't tell.

93
00:13:24.592 --> 00:13:27.425
Yes. yes. yes!

94
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.008
Oh. thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

95
00:13:34.467 --> 00:13:36.633
Yes. yes. yes!

96
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:52.883
Sir. are you all right?

97
00:13:53.675 --> 00:13:54.758
Gun!

98
00:13:54.842 --> 00:13:56.425
He's got a gun!

99
00:13:56.508 --> 00:13:59.675
Shut up! Please!

100
00:13:59.758 --> 00:14:01.258
Come on. dude. Can't hide.
Let's get out of here!

101
00:14:01.342 --> 00:14:03.092
Stop! Mall Security!

102
00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:04.842
No. no. you. you. right there!

103
00:14:04.925 --> 00:14:06.925
Right there! Freeze. Stop!

104
00:14:07.008 --> 00:14:08.217
Move. move. move!

105
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.425
Chief. they're running up
the escalator.

106
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.800
Hey! Stop! Freeze!

107
00:14:12.342 --> 00:14:13.425
Freeze!

108
00:14:13.508 --> 00:14:14.883
No!

109
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.342
We have several
armed assailants running free.

110
00:14:20.425 --> 00:14:22.425
We need the police here.
right now.

111
00:14:24.842 --> 00:14:25.925
Freeze!

112
00:14:26.008 --> 00:14:26.967
Freeze!

113
00:14:28.175 --> 00:14:29.842
Freeze! Freeze!

114
00:14:29.925 --> 00:14:32.050
Whoa. whoa! Hey.
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

115
00:14:32.133 --> 00:14:33.592
No. Dude. dude. calm...

116
00:14:33.675 --> 00:14:35.342
- Get back. man. I'll do it!
- Hey!

117
00:14:35.425 --> 00:14:36.675
Hey. what are you doing?

118
00:14:36.758 --> 00:14:38.133
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

119
00:14:38.217 --> 00:14:39.425
What are you doing?

120
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:41.842
Hey. what are you doing?

121
00:14:41.925 --> 00:14:43.592
- I'm not going back!
- No. no. no!

122
00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:46.133
Just chill out.
Just chill.

123
00:14:46.217 --> 00:14:48.383
- Stand back!
- Don't do it!

124
00:14:48.467 --> 00:14:50.175
No. no. no!

125
00:14:50.258 --> 00:14:52.092
Put the kid back.

126
00:14:52.175 --> 00:14:53.592
Listen to me.

127
00:14:53.675 --> 00:14:55.967
Listen to me!

128
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.300
- No!
- What are you doing?

129
00:14:57.383 --> 00:14:59.800
Pull her back.
Pull her back in!

130
00:14:59.883 --> 00:15:01.133
I'm not going back!

131
00:15:01.217 --> 00:15:02.342
No!

132
00:15:02.425 --> 00:15:03.508
Gonna let her go!

133
00:15:03.592 --> 00:15:05.092
- No. no. no!
- No. no!

134
00:15:13.133 --> 00:15:14.258
What? Who? What?

135
00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.758
We won't be doing that today.

136
00:15:43.842 --> 00:15:45.217
Whoa.

137
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.717
We... We... We should go...

138
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.383
Oh. my gosh!

139
00:15:58.675 --> 00:16:00.217
Hold tight.

140
00:16:11.175 --> 00:16:12.550
I hate guns.

141
00:16:12.633 --> 00:16:14.300
We've got to go now. Come on.

142
00:16:43.342 --> 00:16:45.008
Yo.

143
00:16:46.383 --> 00:16:48.258
I'm sorry. lady.

144
00:16:48.342 --> 00:16:50.092
- Shh.
- I'm sorry. Okay?

145
00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.217
It was his idea.

146
00:17:01.675 --> 00:17:03.800
<i>And the
authorities still have questions.</i>

147
00:17:03.883 --> 00:17:06.467
<i>In fact. the first is
a real doozy. which is.</i>

148
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.383
<i>who exactly
even stopped this crime?</i>

149
00:17:09.467 --> 00:17:11.967
If the story around here
is to be believed.

150
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.925
it wasn't the police.

151
00:17:14.008 --> 00:17:16.967
but a mysterious female savior

152
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:18.633
that multiple witnesses saw.

153
00:17:18.717 --> 00:17:21.592
<i>If this sounds familiar.
it should.</i>

154
00:17:21.675 --> 00:17:25.050
<i>We've now had more than
a half-dozen similar sightings</i>

155
00:17:25.133 --> 00:17:28.592
<i>across the greater D.C. area
in the last year.</i>

156
00:17:28.675 --> 00:17:31.633
<i>Which. of course.
begs the biggest question of today.</i>

157
00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.800
<i>who is this woman</i>

158
00:17:33.883 --> 00:17:36.258
<i>and where did she come from?</i>

159
00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:55.550
Excuse me.
Are you waiting for someone?

160
00:18:55.633 --> 00:18:57.842
No. Just me.

161
00:19:15.967 --> 00:19:17.383
Taxi!

162
00:19:24.092 --> 00:19:26.092
Oh. I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

163
00:19:26.175 --> 00:19:28.758
Hey. we could share.
if you like?

164
00:19:28.842 --> 00:19:31.217
No. thanks. I'll wait.

165
00:20:15.342 --> 00:20:16.967
Oh. my.

166
00:20:20.383 --> 00:20:22.133
- Yeah.
- Hey. Jake.

167
00:20:22.217 --> 00:20:23.842
Jake. hi. Can you...

168
00:20:27.842 --> 00:20:31.967
Hi. I know. walk much?
The latch of my...

169
00:20:35.633 --> 00:20:36.800
Good morning.

170
00:20:37.467 --> 00:20:39.050
Hi. Thank you.

171
00:20:39.133 --> 00:20:42.800
Diana Prince.

172
00:20:42.883 --> 00:20:45.508
Barbara Minerva.
Geology. gemology. lithology.

173
00:20:45.592 --> 00:20:47.133
and part-time cryptozoologist.

174
00:20:47.217 --> 00:20:48.008
Oh. wow.

175
00:20:48.092 --> 00:20:50.217
I kept busy in college.

176
00:20:52.925 --> 00:20:55.883
Sorry. It's these heels.
you know. It's stupid.

177
00:20:55.967 --> 00:20:58.258
I don't know why I was gonna wear heels.
Scientists don't wear heels.

178
00:20:58.342 --> 00:21:00.925
- Sometimes we do.
- Right.

179
00:21:01.008 --> 00:21:03.050
- Right. Those are cool!
- Have a nice day.

180
00:21:03.133 --> 00:21:04.217
I like those.

181
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.592
Animal print.

182
00:21:06.842 --> 00:21:08.175
Do you want to get lunch?

183
00:21:08.842 --> 00:21:09.717
I. uh...

184
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.258
Not now. obviously.

185
00:21:11.342 --> 00:21:14.050
It's morning.
But later today. or whenever.

186
00:21:14.133 --> 00:21:16.175
Like. around...
Like. at lunchtime?

187
00:21:16.258 --> 00:21:17.925
I have a lot of work today.

188
00:21:18.008 --> 00:21:20.258
- But maybe some other time?
- Oh.

189
00:21:20.342 --> 00:21:23.008
- Yeah. I'm busy today. too.
- Great.

190
00:21:23.092 --> 00:21:27.008
Ah! Diana. do you happen to
know who a Barbara Minerva is?

191
00:21:27.092 --> 00:21:28.800
Oh. hi. Carol. Hi.

192
00:21:28.883 --> 00:21:32.008
It's me. I'm Barbara.
Remember? You hired me.

193
00:21:32.092 --> 00:21:34.383
- Started last week.
- Oh!

194
00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:35.758
Gemologist?

195
00:21:35.842 --> 00:21:37.425
Yes. And zoologist.

196
00:21:37.508 --> 00:21:39.508
- We had a couple interviews.
- Yeah.

197
00:21:39.592 --> 00:21:43.008
Well. the FBI are gonna drop off
some artifacts later this afternoon.

198
00:21:43.092 --> 00:21:44.383
The FBI?

199
00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:46.300
- Yeah. Yes.
- They're coming here?

200
00:21:46.383 --> 00:21:47.883
The mall heist yesterday.

201
00:21:47.967 --> 00:21:50.050
apparently they were using
a jewelry store as a front.

202
00:21:50.133 --> 00:21:51.842
Front for what?

203
00:21:51.925 --> 00:21:54.758
Black market. Stolen jewels and
art meant for private buyers.

204
00:21:54.842 --> 00:21:57.008
But we could use your help
identifying one in particular.

205
00:21:57.092 --> 00:21:59.883
My help?
Yeah. I'll help the FBI

206
00:21:59.967 --> 00:22:01.717
with whatever they need.

207
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.925
Is that a yes?

208
00:22:03.008 --> 00:22:04.258
Yes. I would. um...

209
00:22:04.342 --> 00:22:06.342
- I would love to assist you.
- Wonderful.

210
00:22:06.425 --> 00:22:08.550
It's nice to meet you.

211
00:22:08.633 --> 00:22:10.258
We've met.

212
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.258
Have a nice day.

213
00:22:13.342 --> 00:22:14.633
Bye. Diana.

214
00:22:16.842 --> 00:22:20.925
Okay. item number 23.

215
00:22:21.008 --> 00:22:22.842
Shoot. That's not it.

216
00:22:28.008 --> 00:22:30.800
Oh. the Empress of Siam.

217
00:22:30.883 --> 00:22:34.800
Originally found in the wreck
of the <i>Nuestra Senora de Atocha.</i>

218
00:22:35.508 --> 00:22:36.592
Wow.

219
00:22:36.675 --> 00:22:40.092
Sorry. I couldn't resist
coming to see.

220
00:22:40.175 --> 00:22:42.050
Oh. it's okay.

221
00:22:43.092 --> 00:22:44.092
Here it is.

222
00:22:44.175 --> 00:22:46.592
- What is it?
- Um...

223
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.967
Uh...

224
00:22:49.758 --> 00:22:51.675
I can't tell.

225
00:22:54.217 --> 00:22:55.925
Some light.

226
00:22:58.258 --> 00:23:03.008
I think the technical term here
is "extremely lame."

227
00:23:03.092 --> 00:23:05.092
Um...

228
00:23:05.175 --> 00:23:07.550
It's... It's citrine.

229
00:23:07.633 --> 00:23:11.425
A classic stone used in fakes
throughout history.

230
00:23:11.508 --> 00:23:15.300
I can't imagine this is worth
any more than $75.

231
00:23:15.383 --> 00:23:16.592
What do you think?

232
00:23:16.675 --> 00:23:19.258
Fakes aren't my forte.
but let me see.

233
00:23:20.092 --> 00:23:21.133
Mmm.

234
00:23:21.217 --> 00:23:22.508
Latin.

235
00:23:22.592 --> 00:23:24.300
At least
it's an antique. right?

236
00:23:24.383 --> 00:23:27.300
Or a purchase from a stall
on the Ponte Vecchio last week.

237
00:23:27.383 --> 00:23:29.633
- Mmm-hmm.
- You never know.

238
00:23:29.717 --> 00:23:33.133
"Place upon the object held

239
00:23:33.217 --> 00:23:34.925
but one great wish."

240
00:23:35.008 --> 00:23:36.300
You read Latin?

241
00:23:36.383 --> 00:23:39.342
Yeah. Yeah.
Languages are a hobby.

242
00:23:39.425 --> 00:23:41.342
So maybe it's. like.
a lucky charm or something?

243
00:23:41.425 --> 00:23:42.717
Yeah. I guess.

244
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.050
Strange.

245
00:23:44.133 --> 00:23:46.050
I really wish I had a coffee.

246
00:23:47.008 --> 00:23:48.842
You're funny.

247
00:23:48.925 --> 00:23:50.383
Hey. I got Erika a coffee. but she's
out sick. Does anybody want this?

248
00:23:50.467 --> 00:23:53.050
What?
Yeah. I'll take one.

249
00:23:53.883 --> 00:23:54.800
Ooh. hot!

250
00:23:54.883 --> 00:23:55.925
Hot. hot!

251
00:23:56.008 --> 00:23:57.425
Did you see that?

252
00:23:59.883 --> 00:24:01.050
Oh...

253
00:24:02.008 --> 00:24:03.883
Can you imagine?

254
00:24:03.967 --> 00:24:06.175
- If only.
- Hmm.

255
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.675
So many things.
I don't even know what I would wish for.

256
00:24:16.217 --> 00:24:18.258
I do.

257
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.967
Well. um. anyway.
sorry to bother you.

258
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.550
If you need anything.
I'm around.

259
00:24:26.633 --> 00:24:28.092
- Oh. yeah. I'm good.
- Yeah.

260
00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:29.800
But thank you for...

261
00:24:29.883 --> 00:24:31.800
That's okay. It's my job.

262
00:24:31.883 --> 00:24:33.842
And I'll look into it more
when I have a chance.

263
00:24:33.925 --> 00:24:34.883
Okay.

264
00:24:34.967 --> 00:24:37.675
Well. thanks for...

265
00:24:37.758 --> 00:24:40.342
talking to me.

266
00:24:40.425 --> 00:24:42.425
I'm... I'm sorry. uh...

267
00:24:43.092 --> 00:24:45.175
I mean. I'm fine.

268
00:24:45.258 --> 00:24:47.383
You know. we could go
and grab early dinner

269
00:24:47.467 --> 00:24:52.508
and talk about exactly
how lame that stone is.

270
00:24:52.592 --> 00:24:53.592
Really?

271
00:24:53.675 --> 00:24:55.217
Yeah. I mean. citrine?

272
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.508
Who are they kidding. right?

273
00:24:57.592 --> 00:24:58.967
- So lame.
- Dorky.

274
00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.383
- Lame.
- Yeah. let's go.

275
00:25:00.467 --> 00:25:02.967
That's. like.
the lamest of lames.

276
00:25:31.925 --> 00:25:34.633
Wow. You're so funny.

277
00:25:34.717 --> 00:25:36.842
- Oh. Thank you.
- Wow.

278
00:25:36.925 --> 00:25:40.675
I mean. no one's made me laugh
like this in such a long time.

279
00:25:40.758 --> 00:25:43.050
I mean. it's true.
I don't get out much socially.

280
00:25:43.175 --> 00:25:44.800
You don't get out much?

281
00:25:44.883 --> 00:25:46.050
No. not really.

282
00:25:46.133 --> 00:25:47.717
- No.
- I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.

283
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.133
Because you just seem like
the kind of person

284
00:25:50.217 --> 00:25:51.633
who's. like. always out.

285
00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:53.675
Like. people are asking you
to go out all the time

286
00:25:53.758 --> 00:25:55.967
and you live out.
You're just out.

287
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.550
Like. you never get in.

288
00:25:58.633 --> 00:26:01.342
You just seem
like you'd be really popular.

289
00:26:01.425 --> 00:26:03.467
And I would know because
I've never been popular.

290
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.633
You haven't?

291
00:26:04.717 --> 00:26:06.133
You're so personable.

292
00:26:06.217 --> 00:26:09.258
So... free.

293
00:26:09.342 --> 00:26:12.842
I mean. honestly.
I gotta say that I envy that.

294
00:26:12.925 --> 00:26:14.133
What?

295
00:26:14.217 --> 00:26:16.967
You envy me?
That doesn't make any sense.

296
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.050
Oh. my gosh.

297
00:26:19.133 --> 00:26:21.258
People think I'm weird.
They avoid me

298
00:26:21.342 --> 00:26:24.175
and talk behind my back when
they don't think I can hear them.

299
00:26:24.258 --> 00:26:26.300
I'm like. "Guys.
I can hear you."

300
00:26:30.383 --> 00:26:32.592
Barbara. my life

301
00:26:32.675 --> 00:26:35.967
hasn't been
what you probably think it has.

302
00:26:37.217 --> 00:26:39.342
We all have our struggles.

303
00:26:39.425 --> 00:26:40.425
Yeah. we do.

304
00:26:42.758 --> 00:26:44.217
Have you ever been in love?

305
00:26:46.592 --> 00:26:48.717
Uh... Yeah.

306
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.383
- A long. long time ago.
- Mmm.

307
00:26:51.467 --> 00:26:52.550
You?

308
00:26:52.633 --> 00:26:54.842
So many times. yeah.
All the time.

309
00:26:54.925 --> 00:26:56.550
Often.

310
00:26:56.633 --> 00:26:57.842
So what happened?

311
00:26:57.925 --> 00:27:00.008
Where'd he go. your guy?

312
00:27:00.092 --> 00:27:01.717
He. uh...

313
00:27:02.342 --> 00:27:04.342
He died.

314
00:27:04.425 --> 00:27:10.050
But I still think sometimes that
I see him up there in the sky.

315
00:27:10.133 --> 00:27:11.217
He was a pilot.

316
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.425
- Oh!
- He was all kinds of things.

317
00:27:14.508 --> 00:27:18.050
but he was great. It was true.

318
00:27:19.758 --> 00:27:21.717
I get it.

319
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.050
Well. cheers to us.

320
00:27:24.133 --> 00:27:27.383
Wishing us better luck.
I guess.

321
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.925
Hey. Leon.

322
00:27:36.008 --> 00:27:37.550
Hey there. Barbara. Late night?

323
00:27:37.633 --> 00:27:39.133
Yeah. Going back to work.

324
00:27:39.217 --> 00:27:41.300
I wanted to bring this to you
while it was still hot.

325
00:27:41.383 --> 00:27:44.217
- Oh. you're too good to me.
- It's not a problem.

326
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.717
Stay warm.

327
00:27:54.717 --> 00:27:57.925
Hey there. sweetheart.
You need some help?

328
00:27:58.008 --> 00:27:59.383
No. I'm fine. Thank you.

329
00:28:00.133 --> 00:28:01.925
'Cause. uh.

330
00:28:02.008 --> 00:28:04.883
you know. you look as though you're
having a little bit of trouble

331
00:28:04.967 --> 00:28:06.175
walking in those heels. huh?

332
00:28:06.258 --> 00:28:07.550
It's okay. I wear
these heels all the time.

333
00:28:07.633 --> 00:28:09.383
Hey. come on.
Let me walk you home.

334
00:28:09.467 --> 00:28:12.008
- I'm not going home.
- Hey. I'm just trying to be nice here.

335
00:28:12.092 --> 00:28:14.467
Huh? Come on.

336
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:18.425
Hey. hey. Hey. hey!

337
00:28:18.508 --> 00:28:20.008
- What are you doing?
- Hey. hey!

338
00:28:20.092 --> 00:28:21.592
Let go of me!

339
00:28:21.675 --> 00:28:23.008
- I'm just trying to help you!
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

340
00:28:23.092 --> 00:28:25.550
Let go!

341
00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:41.467
Forgot my keys. Lucky.

342
00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.300
- How did you...
- Simple self-defense.

343
00:28:43.383 --> 00:28:45.633
Used his own momentum against him.
I'll teach you.

344
00:28:45.717 --> 00:28:48.050
Honestly. it takes
no power at all.

345
00:28:49.342 --> 00:28:50.383
Are you okay?

346
00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:52.967
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good.

347
00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.508
- Thank you.
- Of course.

348
00:28:54.592 --> 00:28:55.758
Go home. okay?

349
00:28:55.842 --> 00:28:57.717
- Yeah.
- Good night.

350
00:29:36.383 --> 00:29:39.217
I do know what I'd wish for.

351
00:29:41.883 --> 00:29:44.300
To be like Diana.

352
00:29:45.258 --> 00:29:49.175
Strong. sexy.

353
00:29:49.258 --> 00:29:51.217
cool.

354
00:29:54.342 --> 00:29:56.467
Special.

355
00:30:57.175 --> 00:30:58.133
Oh...

356
00:31:29.467 --> 00:31:30.717
Oh. no! Oh!

357
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.092
Sorry.

358
00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:34.467
Oh. it's okay.

359
00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:36.050
Barbara. thank God
you're good in heels.

360
00:31:36.133 --> 00:31:37.717
Oh.

361
00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.300
- Hey. Barbara.
- Hi. Jake.

362
00:31:41.383 --> 00:31:43.300
Wow. Looking good.

363
00:31:43.383 --> 00:31:45.467
- Oh. thanks.
- Yeah.

364
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:48.592
This is our
Earth Sciences lab.

365
00:31:49.258 --> 00:31:50.550
Oh. Barbara!

366
00:31:50.633 --> 00:31:51.717
Hi.

367
00:31:52.842 --> 00:31:53.967
Perfect.

368
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:55.592
I have someone
I would like you to meet.

369
00:31:55.675 --> 00:31:58.175
- A pleasure. Ms. Minerva.
- Oh.

370
00:31:58.258 --> 00:32:01.050
Uh.
it's "Doctor." actually.

371
00:32:01.133 --> 00:32:03.342
Um... Have we met before?
You look familiar.

372
00:32:03.425 --> 00:32:06.050
- Do the thing. Do the thing.
- No.

373
00:32:06.133 --> 00:32:09.258
Life is good.
but it can be better.

374
00:32:10.592 --> 00:32:11.925
Oh. my gosh. From TV.

375
00:32:12.008 --> 00:32:13.633
Oh. my gosh.
You're the oil guy.

376
00:32:13.717 --> 00:32:16.133
- "The oil guy." I'll take it.
- That's right.

377
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.383
Mr. Lord is considering

378
00:32:19.467 --> 00:32:21.925
becoming a Friend of the
Smithsonian at the Partner level.

379
00:32:22.008 --> 00:32:23.842
- Oh.
- Which entitles him to a handful

380
00:32:23.925 --> 00:32:25.050
of private tours
of our facilities.

381
00:32:25.133 --> 00:32:27.633
and he asked for you by name.

382
00:32:27.717 --> 00:32:30.342
- Me?
- Well. what can I say. Doctor?

383
00:32:30.425 --> 00:32:32.175
Your reputation precedes you.

384
00:32:32.258 --> 00:32:36.133
And apparently we share
a passion for gemology.

385
00:32:36.217 --> 00:32:39.008
- Wow. okay. We do.
- I'll leave you to it.

386
00:32:39.092 --> 00:32:40.633
Uh...

387
00:32:40.717 --> 00:32:43.300
Oh. let me just drop this off
in my office.

388
00:32:43.383 --> 00:32:45.258
and we'll go.

389
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.508
Oh! Oh. gosh. Don't look in there.
It's such a mess.

390
00:33:11.133 --> 00:33:14.675
So. I thought maybe
we could start upstairs.

391
00:33:19.425 --> 00:33:21.425
I love that ruby.

392
00:33:21.508 --> 00:33:22.758
Oh. no. Be careful with that.

393
00:33:22.842 --> 00:33:24.425
- What?
- That's very...

394
00:33:26.175 --> 00:33:28.717
Hey. have you seen
my friend? Where'd he go?

395
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.092
- I'm right here.
- You are.

396
00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:31.800
Thank God.

397
00:33:31.883 --> 00:33:33.217
Oh. wait. You've got
a little dust on you.

398
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.592
- Sorry.
- Hey. good morning.

399
00:33:34.675 --> 00:33:35.592
Oh. hi.

400
00:33:35.675 --> 00:33:37.050
- Hi.
- Oh! Uh...

401
00:33:37.133 --> 00:33:39.592
This is the one and only.

402
00:33:39.675 --> 00:33:41.717
Mr. Maxwell Lord.

403
00:33:42.675 --> 00:33:44.508
It's him.

404
00:33:45.925 --> 00:33:47.092
Life is good.

405
00:33:48.342 --> 00:33:49.592
but it can be better.

406
00:33:51.467 --> 00:33:53.092
He's from TV.

407
00:33:53.175 --> 00:33:54.425
Oh. I don't have a TV.

408
00:33:54.508 --> 00:33:56.092
Well. I have a great
relationship with Sears.

409
00:33:56.175 --> 00:33:58.425
I can get you a brand-new TV
by the end of the day.

410
00:33:58.508 --> 00:34:00.175
Nineteen inches.

411
00:34:00.258 --> 00:34:02.633
- No strings attached.
- I'll stick to the one I don't have.

412
00:34:02.717 --> 00:34:04.258
But thank you.

413
00:34:04.342 --> 00:34:05.300
Okay.

414
00:34:05.383 --> 00:34:08.050
You're so generous. Um...

415
00:34:08.133 --> 00:34:09.842
Headline... Uh...

416
00:34:09.925 --> 00:34:11.008
Mr. Lord

417
00:34:11.092 --> 00:34:14.467
took a tour
of the entire Smithsonian

418
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.300
while considering partnership.

419
00:34:16.383 --> 00:34:18.842
and guess
what he decided to do?

420
00:34:18.925 --> 00:34:20.842
Give his entire donation

421
00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:23.008
to our department.

422
00:34:23.092 --> 00:34:25.175
He's announcing it
at tonight's Members' Gala.

423
00:34:25.258 --> 00:34:26.675
It's going to be
an amazing party.

424
00:34:26.758 --> 00:34:29.050
I hope you have
something nice to wear.

425
00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:31.175
I actually tend
to skip these events.

426
00:34:31.258 --> 00:34:35.133
I find that our benefactors with
a true eye towards philanthropy

427
00:34:35.217 --> 00:34:37.133
prefer to stay
out of the spotlight.

428
00:34:37.217 --> 00:34:39.717
To let the museum's work
garner the attention.

429
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.967
I agree.

430
00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:42.050
Except.

431
00:34:42.133 --> 00:34:45.967
I like to party.

432
00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.800
Oh. my gosh.
You're such a good dancer.

433
00:34:48.883 --> 00:34:50.092
- You like Latin dancing?
- I love it.

434
00:34:50.175 --> 00:34:51.717
I know that
I'm a terrible dancer.

435
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.258
No. I doubt that
you're a terrible dancer...

436
00:34:53.342 --> 00:34:55.008
No. I've got a hip injury
from high school.

437
00:34:55.092 --> 00:34:56.050
...the shape that you're in.

438
00:34:56.133 --> 00:34:57.550
Great. so.

439
00:34:57.633 --> 00:34:59.883
- thank you so much for coming.
- Oh. yeah.

440
00:34:59.967 --> 00:35:01.550
You know.
I really should be going.

441
00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:02.800
Thank you for the tour.

442
00:35:02.883 --> 00:35:06.175
I will have to see you tonight.

443
00:35:06.258 --> 00:35:08.425
See you tonight.

444
00:35:08.508 --> 00:35:11.300
Bye. Have a good day.

445
00:35:12.383 --> 00:35:13.550
I'll find you.

446
00:35:16.967 --> 00:35:18.217
What?

447
00:35:19.175 --> 00:35:21.342
I like him.

448
00:35:30.425 --> 00:35:31.758
Thank you. John.

449
00:35:36.758 --> 00:35:38.425
Ladies.

450
00:35:38.508 --> 00:35:40.467
Mr. Lord.

451
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:41.550
Mr. Lord.

452
00:35:41.633 --> 00:35:43.383
Not now. Raquel.
My supplements?

453
00:35:43.467 --> 00:35:47.342
On your desk.
but Mr. Lord.

454
00:35:47.967 --> 00:35:49.842
Mr. Lord.

455
00:35:54.383 --> 00:35:56.008
Mr. Lord.

456
00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:19.217
Mr. Lord.

457
00:36:20.758 --> 00:36:22.342
Mr. Lord.

458
00:36:22.425 --> 00:36:23.342
Dad!

459
00:36:23.425 --> 00:36:24.467
How?

460
00:36:25.175 --> 00:36:26.967
How!

461
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:28.508
It's your weekend.

462
00:36:28.592 --> 00:36:30.592
Yes. clearly.

463
00:36:30.675 --> 00:36:33.592
Alistair.

464
00:36:33.675 --> 00:36:34.883
Where's the pool. Daddy?

465
00:36:34.967 --> 00:36:36.842
It's not done yet. buddy.

466
00:36:36.925 --> 00:36:38.758
But it doesn't matter.

467
00:36:38.842 --> 00:36:40.633
You just have
to be patient.

468
00:36:40.717 --> 00:36:43.050
I told you the pool.

469
00:36:43.133 --> 00:36:44.633
the helicopter.

470
00:36:44.717 --> 00:36:47.425
you'll have it all.
But remember.

471
00:36:47.508 --> 00:36:50.425
Rome wasn't built in a day.
was it? No.

472
00:36:50.508 --> 00:36:52.467
Hasn't it been
a lot of days?

473
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:55.467
Well. it takes time
to become a great. great.

474
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.800
number-one man.
like your dad is going to be.

475
00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:02.300
Are you lying to your son.
like you lie to everyone else?

476
00:37:06.967 --> 00:37:08.217
Simon.

477
00:37:09.717 --> 00:37:11.300
These offices aren't ready
for guests yet.

478
00:37:11.383 --> 00:37:13.758
It's over. Max.

479
00:37:13.842 --> 00:37:16.467
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I'm out.

480
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.050
Alistair. go wait with Raquel.

481
00:37:18.133 --> 00:37:19.050
Simon.

482
00:37:20.633 --> 00:37:22.467
I know it's hard
to see right now.

483
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:25.133
but we are finally right at the
edge of turning this thing around.

484
00:37:25.217 --> 00:37:27.050
"Turning it around"?

485
00:37:27.133 --> 00:37:30.300
There is no oil.
There never was.

486
00:37:30.383 --> 00:37:32.675
So how are you gonna
turn it around?

487
00:37:32.758 --> 00:37:35.675
Get more
sucker investors. like me?

488
00:37:35.758 --> 00:37:37.467
- It's called a Ponzi scheme.
- No!

489
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:39.758
I have a big...

490
00:37:39.842 --> 00:37:42.092
There's something in the works.

491
00:37:42.175 --> 00:37:43.967
And it's no scheme.

492
00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:48.467
Simon. we have millions of acres
of potentially oil-rich land.

493
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.883
You have oil rights on land

494
00:37:50.967 --> 00:37:53.008
that everyone else
passed on already.

495
00:37:53.092 --> 00:37:54.550
Now. it didn't take
much digging

496
00:37:54.633 --> 00:37:55.925
to find that out.

497
00:37:56.008 --> 00:37:58.050
I should have
done some digging on you. too.

498
00:37:58.133 --> 00:37:59.925
Maxwell Lorenzano.

499
00:38:00.008 --> 00:38:03.175
Didn't take long to find out you're
nothing but a lowlife con man.

500
00:38:03.258 --> 00:38:05.633
I am not a con man!

501
00:38:08.758 --> 00:38:12.050
I am a television personality.

502
00:38:12.133 --> 00:38:13.550
And a respected businessman

503
00:38:13.633 --> 00:38:15.050
- with a plan.
- Come on.

504
00:38:15.133 --> 00:38:17.883
- With... With... With a great plan.
- Oh!

505
00:38:17.967 --> 00:38:20.550
"If you can dream it.
you can have it."

506
00:38:20.633 --> 00:38:22.550
Something like that?

507
00:38:23.883 --> 00:38:26.217
You have 48 hours

508
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.383
- to get my money...
- You're going to regret this.

509
00:38:28.467 --> 00:38:31.592
...or the FTC gets an anonymous report.

510
00:38:31.675 --> 00:38:33.758
- Loser.
- Simon. wait.

511
00:38:33.842 --> 00:38:36.258
Simon. wait.

512
00:38:45.633 --> 00:38:47.550
I am not a loser.

513
00:38:48.842 --> 00:38:51.050
He's a loser!

514
00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:54.092
And don't you ever believe
a word that man said.

515
00:38:54.175 --> 00:38:56.550
He's a liar...

516
00:38:56.633 --> 00:38:58.925
and he's wrong.

517
00:39:01.008 --> 00:39:05.133
And he will rue the day
he walked away from me.

518
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.425
And you...

519
00:39:16.675 --> 00:39:21.592
You are going to be so proud
to be my son.

520
00:39:23.342 --> 00:39:25.300
Okay.

521
00:39:29.925 --> 00:39:31.883
You'll see.

522
00:39:34.217 --> 00:39:36.092
Everyone will.

523
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.675
These are known
for a terrific fit.

524
00:40:22.758 --> 00:40:26.508
Yeah. I'm just
not so great with heels.

525
00:40:26.592 --> 00:40:28.133
Just try them.

526
00:40:29.883 --> 00:40:32.675
Come out and show me.

527
00:40:32.758 --> 00:40:34.550
Okay. Hmm.

528
00:40:43.467 --> 00:40:44.883
They do fit well.

529
00:40:44.967 --> 00:40:45.967
Ah.

530
00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:47.133
Huh.

531
00:40:51.133 --> 00:40:53.633
- Yeah. I like it.
- You look

532
00:40:53.717 --> 00:40:55.258
amazing.

533
00:40:55.342 --> 00:40:56.675
Do you think it's too tight?

534
00:40:56.758 --> 00:40:59.175
I think it's just right.

535
00:40:59.258 --> 00:41:01.133
- Wow.
- Yeah.

536
00:41:02.675 --> 00:41:04.217
I'll take it.

537
00:41:23.383 --> 00:41:25.175
Hey there. How are you doing?

538
00:41:53.342 --> 00:41:55.258
- Those shoes are incredible.
- Thank you.

539
00:41:55.342 --> 00:41:58.008
- What a beautiful dress.
- You look fantastic.

540
00:41:58.092 --> 00:41:59.842
Thank you so much.

541
00:42:09.342 --> 00:42:10.508
Dr. Minerva.

542
00:42:12.508 --> 00:42:16.133
You look breathtaking.

543
00:42:17.008 --> 00:42:18.758
Thank you.

544
00:42:18.842 --> 00:42:22.550
I... You know. we have to go to
these sort of things for work a lot.

545
00:42:22.633 --> 00:42:25.050
so I've probably worn this
dress a million times.

546
00:42:25.133 --> 00:42:26.217
Mmm.

547
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.467
Um...

548
00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:30.467
- Actually. no.
- I...

549
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:32.425
I just bought this today.

550
00:42:32.508 --> 00:42:35.133
I never look like this.
Um. not even close.

551
00:42:35.217 --> 00:42:37.717
Took me a long time
to get ready.

552
00:42:41.883 --> 00:42:43.925
Biotin.

553
00:42:44.717 --> 00:42:46.258
You should try it.

554
00:42:46.342 --> 00:42:48.800
Makes you glow like a teenager.

555
00:42:48.883 --> 00:42:50.133
Reverses the clock.

556
00:42:50.217 --> 00:42:53.258
Never accept
the limitations of nature.

557
00:42:53.342 --> 00:42:54.633
Yeah. no.

558
00:42:54.717 --> 00:42:57.050
Especially not
a beautiful woman like you.

559
00:42:57.133 --> 00:42:58.300
Oh...

560
00:43:01.508 --> 00:43:03.842
God. it's so loud in here.

561
00:43:03.925 --> 00:43:05.217
Yeah.

562
00:43:06.383 --> 00:43:08.342
Can we go somewhere?

563
00:43:08.425 --> 00:43:10.508
- Just me and you?
- Yes.

564
00:43:12.467 --> 00:43:13.842
Hmm... Your office?

565
00:43:25.342 --> 00:43:30.675
Oh. wow! Look at all
of this stuff. It's so...

566
00:43:30.758 --> 00:43:32.967
It's so beautiful.

567
00:43:34.592 --> 00:43:36.550
Like you.

568
00:43:42.133 --> 00:43:44.092
What is that?

569
00:43:44.175 --> 00:43:45.342
Um...

570
00:43:45.425 --> 00:43:48.383
Uh. it's nothing special.
really.

571
00:43:48.467 --> 00:43:52.508
But the FBI did ask me
to help them identify it.

572
00:43:52.592 --> 00:43:54.050
Wow.

573
00:43:54.133 --> 00:43:55.592
Though it certainly
has me stumped so far.

574
00:43:55.675 --> 00:43:57.508
Let me help you.

575
00:43:57.592 --> 00:44:00.550
Max is here. No need to be
stumped ever again.

576
00:44:00.633 --> 00:44:03.425
I have a dear friend
in Roman antiquities.

577
00:44:03.508 --> 00:44:06.175
- Roman antiquities.
- Could give it a look. if you like?

578
00:44:08.633 --> 00:44:10.925
It is Latin. isn't it?

579
00:44:13.467 --> 00:44:15.925
I really shouldn't let it
go out of the museum.

580
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.467
- Hey there. beautiful.
- No. thank you. Excuse me.

581
00:44:30.175 --> 00:44:31.675
Oh. Diana.

582
00:44:32.508 --> 00:44:34.425
Hoping I'd see you.

583
00:44:34.508 --> 00:44:36.717
Hey. do you know
I'm at the White House now?

584
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.758
Yeah. that's right. Interning.
but requested by name. so...

585
00:44:40.842 --> 00:44:43.633
Listen. I've had my eyes on you
for some time.

586
00:44:43.717 --> 00:44:46.633
- So if you ever need...
- That's great. Carl.

587
00:44:49.967 --> 00:44:52.008
Diana.

588
00:44:56.758 --> 00:44:58.425
Diana.

589
00:44:58.508 --> 00:45:01.133
Excuse me. I don't even know
you. so please stop following me.

590
00:45:06.175 --> 00:45:08.008
- Good night.
- But...

591
00:45:08.092 --> 00:45:10.383
I wish we had more time.

592
00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.008
Why did you say that?

593
00:45:17.925 --> 00:45:19.675
Don't say that to me.

594
00:45:19.758 --> 00:45:21.342
You don't even know me.

595
00:45:21.425 --> 00:45:23.758
Yes. I do.

596
00:45:34.717 --> 00:45:37.133
I can save today...

597
00:45:37.217 --> 00:45:40.092
but you can save the world.

598
00:45:47.967 --> 00:45:49.967
Steve?

599
00:45:53.925 --> 00:45:55.800
Diana.

600
00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:00.342
But how?

601
00:46:00.425 --> 00:46:02.633
I don't know.

602
00:46:08.842 --> 00:46:10.592
Oh. my God.

603
00:46:13.008 --> 00:46:14.175
It's you.

604
00:46:25.217 --> 00:46:27.592
I missed you.

605
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:32.425
<i>So what do you remember?</i>

606
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.842
I remember...

607
00:46:35.925 --> 00:46:37.550
I remember taking
the plane up...

608
00:46:37.633 --> 00:46:38.925
Mmm-hmm.

609
00:46:39.008 --> 00:46:40.883
...and then...

610
00:46:41.508 --> 00:46:44.175
nothing. really.

611
00:46:44.258 --> 00:46:45.675
Nothing.

612
00:46:45.758 --> 00:46:48.342
But somehow. I know
I've been someplace since then.

613
00:46:48.425 --> 00:46:51.092
Someplace that's. uh...

614
00:46:52.467 --> 00:46:55.342
I can't really put words to it.

615
00:46:55.425 --> 00:46:59.133
But it's... It's good.

616
00:47:04.925 --> 00:47:07.467
And then I. uh...
I woke up here.

617
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:08.383
Where?

618
00:47:08.467 --> 00:47:11.883
I ended up in a bed. Uh...

619
00:47:11.967 --> 00:47:16.300
Strange. strange pillow bed
with slats.

620
00:47:16.383 --> 00:47:18.133
- A futon. yeah.
- A futon?

621
00:47:18.217 --> 00:47:19.592
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

622
00:47:19.675 --> 00:47:24.383
Well. not comfortable.
And really a bit backwards

623
00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:26.592
if I'm being
really honest with you.

624
00:47:26.675 --> 00:47:29.217
I mean. for a futuristic time
like this. Nineteen...

625
00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.967
Eighty-four. 1984.

626
00:47:42.675 --> 00:47:45.717
That's amazing.

627
00:47:59.217 --> 00:48:03.217
Would you like
to see my futon?

628
00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:16.550
Yeah. Um...

629
00:48:17.467 --> 00:48:19.592
You don't have to tell me.

630
00:48:19.675 --> 00:48:24.175
The place is a mess.
Cheese on demand.

631
00:48:24.258 --> 00:48:27.008
I spent all morning
cleaning his bedroom.

632
00:48:27.092 --> 00:48:30.425
but he seems to me
to be an engineer.

633
00:48:30.508 --> 00:48:32.925
Lots of pictures of himself.

634
00:48:33.008 --> 00:48:38.717
Not what I would do.
but to each his own.

635
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.967
Oh. so this is
how you found me.

636
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.342
Yeah. the phone book.

637
00:48:43.425 --> 00:48:46.008
I guess some things
are just future-proof.

638
00:48:46.092 --> 00:48:47.342
So you went to my apartment?

639
00:48:47.425 --> 00:48:48.925
Yeah. I tried to use
the bike at first.

640
00:48:49.008 --> 00:48:53.925
I couldn't really figure out
how to get it going.

641
00:48:54.008 --> 00:48:57.550
so I ran over
and saw you come back.

642
00:48:58.592 --> 00:49:02.675
And I was stunned.

643
00:49:04.383 --> 00:49:05.842
There you were.

644
00:49:07.717 --> 00:49:10.508
So I just. uh...

645
00:49:10.592 --> 00:49:12.967
followed you. like a creep.

646
00:49:16.092 --> 00:49:19.008
Diana. look at you. It's...

647
00:49:19.092 --> 00:49:23.425
It's like not one day
has passed.

648
00:49:23.508 --> 00:49:26.092
I can't say the same thing
about you.

649
00:49:26.175 --> 00:49:31.300
Right. right. right.
Right.

650
00:49:38.717 --> 00:49:40.300
Yeah. he's. uh...

651
00:50:07.008 --> 00:50:08.383
He's got it.

652
00:50:08.467 --> 00:50:11.175
No. I like him.

653
00:50:12.383 --> 00:50:16.925
He's great.
but all I see is you.

654
00:50:37.008 --> 00:50:41.217
"One great wish."
I've been waiting.

655
00:50:46.758 --> 00:50:49.425
I wish to be you.

656
00:50:49.508 --> 00:50:52.217
The Dreamstone itself.

657
00:51:51.342 --> 00:51:52.258
Hi.

658
00:51:54.092 --> 00:51:55.342
Come here.

659
00:51:55.425 --> 00:51:57.175
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

660
00:52:02.092 --> 00:52:03.675
Been eating Pop-Tarts
all morning.

661
00:52:03.758 --> 00:52:06.508
and I've had about
three pots of coffee.

662
00:52:06.592 --> 00:52:10.758
This place is amazing.

663
00:52:11.842 --> 00:52:13.592
- This place?
- Yeah.

664
00:52:13.675 --> 00:52:15.883
You know.
if I really think about it.

665
00:52:15.967 --> 00:52:19.008
I don't think I've ever been
in a room more amazing.

666
00:52:20.217 --> 00:52:21.717
- It's true.
- Yeah.

667
00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.842
This room is
the most amazing place

668
00:52:23.925 --> 00:52:25.217
I've ever been in.
in my entire life.

669
00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.800
It's the most
amazing place. right?

670
00:52:26.883 --> 00:52:30.258
So let's stay. We shouldn't go.

671
00:52:30.342 --> 00:52:32.758
- I really don't want to.
- So. let's not.

672
00:52:32.842 --> 00:52:33.842
- Okay.
- Okay.

673
00:52:33.925 --> 00:52:35.050
Let's just stay here.

674
00:52:35.133 --> 00:52:36.675
Let's just stay here.

675
00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:38.800
Forever.

676
00:52:41.883 --> 00:52:43.050
Although...

677
00:52:43.133 --> 00:52:45.883
I should probably go
and figure out

678
00:52:45.967 --> 00:52:50.967
how a stone brought my boyfriend
back in someone else's body.

679
00:52:55.175 --> 00:52:57.550
That's a fair point. Let's go.

680
00:53:40.175 --> 00:53:41.342
Whoa.

681
00:53:55.467 --> 00:53:56.633
Mr. Stagg?

682
00:53:56.717 --> 00:53:58.633
Thank you. Belinda.

683
00:53:59.467 --> 00:54:00.550
Oh. God.

684
00:54:01.633 --> 00:54:03.758
You'd better be here
with my money.

685
00:54:03.842 --> 00:54:06.967
I'll have your money. Simon.
Today. I'm here for an apology.

686
00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.633
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not going to apologize.

687
00:54:09.717 --> 00:54:10.925
I'm sorry.

688
00:54:11.008 --> 00:54:13.925
I messed up. I messed up.

689
00:54:14.008 --> 00:54:15.508
I lied.

690
00:54:16.842 --> 00:54:18.592
And I'm sorry.

691
00:54:18.675 --> 00:54:21.842
You know. the truth is. I knew we
were going to sink a long time ago.

692
00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:24.008
The wells were coming up dry.

693
00:54:24.092 --> 00:54:27.675
And no data suggested
that was going to change.

694
00:54:27.758 --> 00:54:29.383
I should have folded then.

695
00:54:29.467 --> 00:54:32.633
But all the people that bought
in. that believed in me.

696
00:54:32.717 --> 00:54:35.008
- I wanted to do right.
- Oh. come on.

697
00:54:35.092 --> 00:54:36.842
Max. look. you don't have to...

698
00:54:36.925 --> 00:54:40.758
Simon. don't you understand
that I wished for better?

699
00:54:40.842 --> 00:54:43.342
That with every ounce
of my being.

700
00:54:43.425 --> 00:54:47.800
I wished that Black Gold would
change the world for all of us.

701
00:54:49.592 --> 00:54:51.175
And I know
you wished that. too.

702
00:54:51.258 --> 00:54:54.050
Of course I wished that. too.

703
00:54:57.883 --> 00:54:59.758
Then your wish is granted.

704
00:54:59.842 --> 00:55:02.633
And in return.
I'll take all of your shares...

705
00:55:04.675 --> 00:55:06.592
and full control of Black Gold.

706
00:55:06.675 --> 00:55:09.717
after you are somehow magically
removed from my path...

707
00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:12.092
- You're gonna what?
- ...forever.

708
00:55:14.508 --> 00:55:16.383
Max!

709
00:55:16.467 --> 00:55:18.050
Hey. Max!

710
00:55:19.508 --> 00:55:22.717
- Get back here! Max!
- Ow.

711
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.008
What the hell is going on?

712
00:55:31.842 --> 00:55:33.217
We have a warrant
for Simon Stagg.

713
00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:34.800
My word. Are we in danger?

714
00:55:34.883 --> 00:55:36.842
No. sir.
Federal taxation crime.

715
00:55:36.925 --> 00:55:38.758
It doesn't concern you.
Move along.

716
00:55:39.675 --> 00:55:41.008
Send them through.

717
00:55:41.092 --> 00:55:43.133
- Okay. Follow me.
- Let's go. guys.

718
00:55:55.467 --> 00:55:56.675
Ooh.

719
00:55:58.967 --> 00:56:02.383
So you said a stone
started all of this?

720
00:56:02.467 --> 00:56:04.758
Yeah. that's what we need
to go and find out.

721
00:56:04.842 --> 00:56:07.342
I mean. it must have
done something.

722
00:56:07.425 --> 00:56:10.383
This is dynamite.

723
00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:11.550
What do you think?

724
00:56:11.633 --> 00:56:13.925
- Yeah. Yeah...
- Huh? Right?

725
00:56:14.008 --> 00:56:17.300
I saw a couple of magazine pictures.
They roll these up.

726
00:56:17.383 --> 00:56:19.175
I think we can do better.

727
00:56:19.258 --> 00:56:21.800
Look at all the pockets in this.
There are pockets here.

728
00:56:21.883 --> 00:56:23.258
There are pockets
all over the pant.

729
00:56:23.342 --> 00:56:26.967
American issue bag. adjustable.

730
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.675
Parachute pants?

731
00:56:28.758 --> 00:56:31.467
- Yeah. Uh...
- Does everybody parachute now?

732
00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:33.133
<i>You know.
I'm not so keen on this one.</i>

733
00:56:33.217 --> 00:56:36.675
I figure you are. but you know
what. I'm ready to go.

734
00:56:36.758 --> 00:56:37.717
Mmm-mmm.

735
00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:40.217
- Right?
- No.

736
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.758
- You're not even giving it a second.
- It's not good.

737
00:56:42.842 --> 00:56:45.508
"Too much" in a good way
or a bad way? Right?

738
00:56:45.592 --> 00:56:47.258
- In a bad way.
- Oh.

739
00:56:49.342 --> 00:56:50.550
Now that's great.

740
00:56:50.633 --> 00:56:52.508
It's beautiful.

741
00:56:52.592 --> 00:56:55.133
Yeah. I would absolutely
never wear it.

742
00:56:55.217 --> 00:56:56.967
- I feel like a pirate.
- Steve.

743
00:56:57.050 --> 00:56:59.800
Who would wear this?

744
00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:01.008
Diana.

745
00:57:01.092 --> 00:57:02.550
have you seen these shoes?

746
00:57:02.633 --> 00:57:05.008
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Let's keep the shoes. Yes!

747
00:57:05.092 --> 00:57:06.342
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Yes!

748
00:57:15.883 --> 00:57:18.383
This is a special one. okay?

749
00:57:18.467 --> 00:57:20.675
- Let's do this together.
- Uh-huh.

750
00:57:22.342 --> 00:57:24.842
One foot after the other.

751
00:57:24.925 --> 00:57:26.800
Now stay on this one.

752
00:57:26.883 --> 00:57:28.675
Go to the middle.

753
00:57:28.758 --> 00:57:30.675
No. Steve...

754
00:57:30.758 --> 00:57:32.717
Steve. you're gonna fall.

755
00:57:38.383 --> 00:57:40.967
I really thought
I was gonna fall.

756
00:57:56.175 --> 00:57:57.967
What's up?

757
00:58:18.633 --> 00:58:20.633
This is break dance.

758
00:58:20.717 --> 00:58:22.383
- Dancing?
- Yeah.

759
00:58:27.633 --> 00:58:28.925
- Whoa!
- Oh. don't worry.

760
00:58:29.008 --> 00:58:30.217
- It's fine. It's just a move.
- Yeah? Oh.

761
00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.425
It's nothing.

762
00:58:36.592 --> 00:58:38.883
It's all art.

763
00:58:41.675 --> 00:58:42.758
Yeah.

764
00:58:47.508 --> 00:58:49.175
Uh... That's just a trash can.

765
00:58:49.258 --> 00:58:51.258
It's just a trash can.
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

766
00:58:54.925 --> 00:58:57.633
Is that a plane?

767
00:58:57.717 --> 00:59:00.467
Come on.
I want to show you something.

768
00:59:20.258 --> 00:59:22.800
This is incredible!

769
00:59:36.842 --> 00:59:39.300
<i>And every time we strike gold.</i>

770
00:59:39.383 --> 00:59:41.467
<i>you strike gold.</i>

771
00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:46.300
<i>Think about finally having
everything you've always wished for.</i>

772
00:59:46.383 --> 00:59:48.717
Raquel?

773
00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:52.383
Raquel?

774
00:59:54.467 --> 00:59:57.508
Black Gold. Can you hold. please?

775
00:59:59.467 --> 01:00:02.508
Black Gold. Yes. Hold. please.

776
01:00:02.592 --> 01:00:04.133
- Raquel?
- Hold. please.

777
01:00:04.217 --> 01:00:05.383
The wells struck pay!

778
01:00:05.467 --> 01:00:06.842
- Which ones?
- All of them.

779
01:00:06.925 --> 01:00:08.883
And the investors
heard about it somehow.

780
01:00:08.967 --> 01:00:11.383
They're calling to up their buys.
Their friends are calling to buy in.

781
01:00:11.467 --> 01:00:13.550
New investors are calling
out of thin air.

782
01:00:13.633 --> 01:00:15.342
Hold on. please.
I need more help.

783
01:00:15.425 --> 01:00:18.217
- Black Gold. Can you hold. please?
- I'll get you help.

784
01:00:20.425 --> 01:00:22.717
Tell me again.
You wish you had more help?

785
01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.467
Yes. I wish I had more help.

786
01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:26.133
There are just
too many calls to take.

787
01:00:26.217 --> 01:00:27.800
Uh... Hi.

788
01:00:27.883 --> 01:00:29.342
I'm sorry to bother you.

789
01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:31.300
I'm meant to be interviewing
at an accounting firm.

790
01:00:31.383 --> 01:00:32.717
- You're hired!
- Oh...

791
01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.883
Welcome aboard!

792
01:00:33.967 --> 01:00:35.550
- Emerson.
- Emerson!

793
01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:37.217
Is this the employment office?

794
01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.633
Yes! You're hired. too!

795
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.967
Mr. Lord.
it's <i>Wall Street Journal.</i>

796
01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:45.342
They want to interview you
about company's sudden surge.

797
01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:48.883
I'll take it in my office.

798
01:00:50.092 --> 01:00:53.550
And bring me my vitamins.

799
01:00:53.633 --> 01:00:55.550
So I did read
about four books last night...

800
01:00:57.717 --> 01:00:58.967
...to try to get to the bottom of this.
And did find out. Roger. you were right.

801
01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:00.383
This is from the Song Dynasty.

802
01:01:00.467 --> 01:01:01.550
You were correct.

803
01:01:01.633 --> 01:01:03.383
And also interesting.

804
01:01:03.467 --> 01:01:05.217
I was looking at a couple of
encyclopedias last night and you...

805
01:01:06.425 --> 01:01:07.842
Thanks. Um...

806
01:01:10.425 --> 01:01:13.425
So funny. all this reading seems
to have cured my eyesight somehow.

807
01:01:15.133 --> 01:01:17.008
- Interesting fact which we...
- Hey.

808
01:01:17.092 --> 01:01:18.967
- Hi.
- Good morning.

809
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.550
This is Steve. He's my. um...

810
01:01:21.633 --> 01:01:22.592
- Old friend.
- Yeah.

811
01:01:22.675 --> 01:01:25.092
Hi. old friend Steve.

812
01:01:25.175 --> 01:01:27.258
I'm Barbara.
Diana's new friend.

813
01:01:27.342 --> 01:01:28.758
So what do you do?

814
01:01:28.842 --> 01:01:30.467
I'm a pilot.

815
01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:32.217
- Pilot? Isn't that...
- Can I speak to you for a second?

816
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.508
Sure.

817
01:01:36.258 --> 01:01:40.008
So. I just wanted to speak
to you about that stone.

818
01:01:40.092 --> 01:01:41.467
The citrine one.

819
01:01:42.592 --> 01:01:44.258
- Do you have it?
- Uh...

820
01:01:44.342 --> 01:01:47.800
Long story. actually.
about that.

821
01:01:47.883 --> 01:01:51.175
Max Lord came by
to visit yesterday.

822
01:01:51.258 --> 01:01:53.592
Which was actually
pretty great.

823
01:01:53.675 --> 01:01:55.800
I'll tell you
about it later. Um...

824
01:01:55.883 --> 01:01:58.300
I let him

825
01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.800
borrow it.

826
01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.092
What? Why?

827
01:02:01.175 --> 01:02:02.425
Well. Diana.

828
01:02:02.508 --> 01:02:03.925
he just gave us
a huge amount of money.

829
01:02:04.008 --> 01:02:05.717
It's not like he's a stranger
or anything.

830
01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.383
Plus he has a friend who's an
expert. and I don't know...

831
01:02:07.467 --> 01:02:09.300
What do you mean?
How could you loan it?

832
01:02:09.383 --> 01:02:11.217
- It's not even ours to loan.
- Whoa. Whoa.

833
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.383
What are you getting
on my case for?

834
01:02:13.467 --> 01:02:17.050
I've got 15 things in my office
more valuable than that stone.

835
01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:18.883
Do you know where he took it?

836
01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:21.383
No. I have no idea.

837
01:02:21.467 --> 01:02:23.300
Then I'll tell you
what we find out.

838
01:02:23.383 --> 01:02:24.633
Let's go.

839
01:02:24.717 --> 01:02:26.800
- I like your pants very much.
- Oh. thanks.

840
01:02:26.883 --> 01:02:28.258
Yeah. Call me.

841
01:02:28.342 --> 01:02:30.633
Or not. Whatever.

842
01:02:30.717 --> 01:02:32.967
But I'd be curious.

843
01:02:38.925 --> 01:02:41.633
<i>Call the Black Gold hotline.</i>

844
01:02:41.717 --> 01:02:44.467
<i>Shares are not available
in the building.</i>

845
01:02:47.967 --> 01:02:49.092
What are these people doing?

846
01:02:49.175 --> 01:02:50.383
Whatever it is.

847
01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:52.425
we're not getting in that way.

848
01:02:54.258 --> 01:02:57.467
Diana. Diana. this way.

849
01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:07.925
Have at it.

850
01:03:22.508 --> 01:03:23.800
Strong lock.

851
01:03:38.675 --> 01:03:39.925
Steve.

852
01:03:56.175 --> 01:03:59.050
- It's so dusty.
- Yeah.

853
01:04:00.175 --> 01:04:02.300
It's like a bomb went off.

854
01:04:14.008 --> 01:04:16.842
Whatever this is.
he's been looking for it for a long time.

855
01:04:29.092 --> 01:04:32.967
"Place upon
the object held."

856
01:04:35.842 --> 01:04:37.758
What is it?

857
01:04:37.842 --> 01:04:40.467
The language of the Gods.

858
01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:43.342
Which God wrote it.
is the question.

859
01:04:46.217 --> 01:04:47.467
Thanks.

860
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.133
- Oh. yeah.
- Yeah. It's okay.

861
01:04:49.217 --> 01:04:51.342
I gotta go do something. Okay.
I'll talk to you. All right?

862
01:04:51.425 --> 01:04:53.758
- Hello?
- <i>Barbara. I need your help.</i>

863
01:04:53.842 --> 01:04:55.925
<i>I need you to find out</i>

864
01:04:56.008 --> 01:04:58.633
exactly where
that stone was found.

865
01:04:58.717 --> 01:05:00.967
"Where" is what I need to know.
You understand?

866
01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:03.258
<i>Yeah. Yeah. yeah. I'm on it.</i>

867
01:05:03.342 --> 01:05:05.008
Thanks.

868
01:05:07.342 --> 01:05:09.342
You look like you saw a ghost.

869
01:05:10.925 --> 01:05:12.633
I did.

870
01:05:15.383 --> 01:05:17.883
There were many Gods

871
01:05:17.967 --> 01:05:20.675
and they did different things
for different reasons.

872
01:05:20.758 --> 01:05:24.842
One was making
objects like this.

873
01:05:24.925 --> 01:05:27.217
There are universal elements
in this world.

874
01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:30.300
and when they're imbued
into something.

875
01:05:30.383 --> 01:05:34.800
they can become
very. very powerful.

876
01:05:35.758 --> 01:05:37.633
Like my Lasso of Truth.

877
01:05:37.717 --> 01:05:40.008
The truth is what powers it.
not me.

878
01:05:40.092 --> 01:05:43.175
The truth is bigger
than all of us.

879
01:05:43.258 --> 01:05:45.133
But what is this?

880
01:05:46.758 --> 01:05:48.383
I don't know. Uh...

881
01:05:50.133 --> 01:05:52.050
Brought me back.

882
01:05:53.592 --> 01:05:57.508
Love or hope...

883
01:05:58.217 --> 01:05:59.967
maybe?

884
01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:03.508
Maybe.

885
01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:08.425
Well. whatever it is. I can promise you
this is too powerful for Maxwell Lord.

886
01:06:08.508 --> 01:06:10.300
We need to find this guy.

887
01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:12.300
Uh...

888
01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.592
Look at this.

889
01:06:21.675 --> 01:06:24.092
If this date's right.
he's going to Cairo.

890
01:06:25.008 --> 01:06:27.092
Cairo?

891
01:06:27.175 --> 01:06:30.383
Yeah.
Growth opportunity. you know?

892
01:06:30.467 --> 01:06:32.925
"King of Crude"?

893
01:06:33.008 --> 01:06:35.008
How is this so fast?

894
01:06:36.633 --> 01:06:38.467
You have a plane that can fly

895
01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:40.008
from here to Cairo in one shot?

896
01:06:40.092 --> 01:06:41.925
That is amazing.

897
01:06:42.008 --> 01:06:44.592
Yeah. but we can't get you on one
because you don't have a passport.

898
01:06:44.675 --> 01:06:46.175
I don't want to get on one.

899
01:06:46.258 --> 01:06:48.050
I want to fly one.
I want to fly the plane.

900
01:06:48.133 --> 01:06:49.633
I want to fly this plane.

901
01:06:50.717 --> 01:06:51.883
Yeah?

902
01:07:17.258 --> 01:07:19.633
Oh. my Betsy.

903
01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.633
Hey. Steve. this way.

904
01:07:26.717 --> 01:07:28.467
Yeah.

905
01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:31.800
Look at these gams.

906
01:07:41.175 --> 01:07:42.717
You wanna choose?

907
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:46.800
This one.

908
01:07:47.508 --> 01:07:48.967
I like it.

909
01:07:59.967 --> 01:08:01.425
Okay.

910
01:08:04.258 --> 01:08:07.258
Okay. Uh...

911
01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.050
No.

912
01:08:10.133 --> 01:08:11.883
Uh...

913
01:08:13.008 --> 01:08:14.425
All right. Good. good.

914
01:08:14.508 --> 01:08:16.550
Fuel. fuel. fuel.

915
01:08:16.633 --> 01:08:18.217
Here we go. Engine.

916
01:08:20.258 --> 01:08:21.592
Here goes nothing.

917
01:08:24.842 --> 01:08:26.008
Oh...

918
01:08:38.092 --> 01:08:39.300
- Ken?
- What?

919
01:08:39.383 --> 01:08:41.050
There's an aircraft
on the runway.

920
01:08:41.133 --> 01:08:42.550
What do you mean.
"There's an aircraft on the runway"?

921
01:08:42.633 --> 01:08:43.925
Approach. this is Tower.

922
01:08:44.008 --> 01:08:45.342
There's an unlisted aircraft
on the runway.

923
01:08:45.425 --> 01:08:46.675
Are you seeing this?

924
01:08:50.842 --> 01:08:52.508
- Can you get us up there?
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

925
01:08:52.592 --> 01:08:54.092
I just have to pick up
speed first.

926
01:08:54.175 --> 01:08:55.758
and then I'll take off.

927
01:08:55.842 --> 01:08:58.758
The way I fly.
they will never find us.

928
01:09:03.133 --> 01:09:05.258
- Oh. I forgot to tell you.
- What?

929
01:09:05.342 --> 01:09:06.717
Radar. I can't explain now.

930
01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.008
but they'll see us anywhere.
even in the dark.

931
01:09:09.092 --> 01:09:11.842
Well. will they shoot at us?

932
01:09:12.967 --> 01:09:15.133
- Well. shit. Diana.
- Right.

933
01:09:21.633 --> 01:09:23.842
- Diana.
- Wait. Shh! I know.

934
01:09:23.925 --> 01:09:27.050
I know. Focus.

935
01:09:27.133 --> 01:09:28.967
Focus.

936
01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:31.175
My father hid Themyscira
from the world.

937
01:09:31.258 --> 01:09:33.508
and I've been trying to learn
how he did it.

938
01:09:33.592 --> 01:09:34.675
Did what?

939
01:09:34.758 --> 01:09:36.633
Made something invisible.

940
01:09:36.717 --> 01:09:38.883
But in 50 years.
I've only done it once.

941
01:09:38.967 --> 01:09:40.508
Well. now's not a bad time
to start trying.

942
01:09:40.592 --> 01:09:42.717
- How long does it last?
- I don't know.

943
01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.342
It was just a coffee cup...

944
01:09:45.425 --> 01:09:47.050
and I lost it.

945
01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:13.633
Approach.

946
01:10:13.717 --> 01:10:14.842
the aircraft has vanished.

947
01:10:14.925 --> 01:10:16.092
Do you have eyes on it?

948
01:10:44.342 --> 01:10:46.633
An invisible jet.

949
01:11:09.842 --> 01:11:11.300
What's that?

950
01:11:13.592 --> 01:11:14.550
Oh. it's okay.

951
01:11:14.633 --> 01:11:16.592
It's just fireworks.

952
01:11:16.675 --> 01:11:19.342
The Fourth. Of course.

953
01:11:19.425 --> 01:11:20.925
The Fourth of July?

954
01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:02.550
Wow.

955
01:12:14.133 --> 01:12:15.717
I got an idea.

956
01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:53.842
You know. it's the one thing.

957
01:12:53.925 --> 01:12:56.217
The one thing
that's always been you to me.

958
01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.217
What?

959
01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:58.383
Flight.

960
01:12:58.467 --> 01:13:00.133
Your gift.

961
01:13:00.217 --> 01:13:02.717
I'll never understand it.

962
01:13:03.467 --> 01:13:05.008
Ah. it's...

963
01:13:06.425 --> 01:13:08.675
It's so easy. really.

964
01:13:08.758 --> 01:13:11.800
It's wind and air

965
01:13:11.883 --> 01:13:15.967
and knowing how to ride it.
how to catch it.

966
01:13:17.383 --> 01:13:19.008
How to join with it.

967
01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.008
Yeah.

968
01:13:22.092 --> 01:13:24.675
It's like anything. really.

969
01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.175
Great. thanks.

970
01:13:51.258 --> 01:13:54.425
Found the last one.

971
01:13:54.508 --> 01:13:56.508
This should keep you busy
for a while.

972
01:13:58.050 --> 01:14:01.675
Anything else I can get you?
Coffee?

973
01:14:02.092 --> 01:14:03.675
Tea?

974
01:14:03.758 --> 01:14:05.717
Me?

975
01:14:07.133 --> 01:14:09.967
I don't need anything from you.
and I'm done.

976
01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:11.842
You're done?

977
01:14:11.925 --> 01:14:14.842
Hey. you don't have
to be mean about it.

978
01:14:21.717 --> 01:14:23.842
Hey. babe.
Where you going?

979
01:14:23.925 --> 01:14:25.633
No thanks.

980
01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.592
Ooh. you're pretty.

981
01:14:31.675 --> 01:14:33.758
Hey. slow down. sexy.

982
01:14:38.925 --> 01:14:40.217
You talking to me?

983
01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.342
Yep. I'm talking to you.

984
01:14:43.508 --> 01:14:46.842
Why don't you just
slow down a bit. huh?

985
01:14:46.925 --> 01:14:48.842
Come on. girl.

986
01:14:48.925 --> 01:14:51.675
I'd rather not.
You know what I mean?

987
01:14:54.008 --> 01:14:56.383
I'd rather not have anything
to do with someone like you.

988
01:14:56.467 --> 01:14:59.092
I'd rather you stop
harassing people.

989
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:02.883
Like me.

990
01:15:02.967 --> 01:15:04.258
Do you remember me?

991
01:15:06.133 --> 01:15:08.758
Oh. yeah. yeah.

992
01:15:08.842 --> 01:15:12.092
I remember.
Where were we. huh?

993
01:15:15.008 --> 01:15:16.175
No.

994
01:15:20.258 --> 01:15:21.425
No.

995
01:15:27.967 --> 01:15:28.967
No.

996
01:15:31.258 --> 01:15:32.342
She's right.

997
01:15:32.425 --> 01:15:34.717
It's not that hard.

998
01:15:40.008 --> 01:15:43.008
Yeah. I think I get it now.

999
01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.342
His body weight
does do all the work.

1000
01:15:50.508 --> 01:15:52.092
So easy.

1001
01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:55.342
I think

1002
01:15:55.425 --> 01:15:56.967
I could do this...

1003
01:15:59.508 --> 01:16:01.675
all...

1004
01:16:03.175 --> 01:16:04.383
night...

1005
01:16:05.883 --> 01:16:07.842
long!

1006
01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:26.883
Barbara?

1007
01:16:30.342 --> 01:16:32.217
What are you doing?

1008
01:16:34.592 --> 01:16:36.967
Mind your business.

1009
01:16:44.717 --> 01:16:46.092
Sir?

1010
01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:58.592
Your fortune the last few days
has been impressive. to say the least.

1011
01:16:58.675 --> 01:17:02.258
But why come all this way
to meet with me? Hmm?

1012
01:17:03.342 --> 01:17:05.008
To meet a peer.

1013
01:17:05.092 --> 01:17:06.842
A peer?

1014
01:17:06.925 --> 01:17:10.550
No. Mr. Lord. I only agreed to meet
with you because I was curious.

1015
01:17:10.633 --> 01:17:13.800
No one gets that lucky.
How did you do it?

1016
01:17:16.425 --> 01:17:20.300
On my journey
to self-fulfillment...

1017
01:17:20.383 --> 01:17:22.675
I lucked into a secret.

1018
01:17:22.758 --> 01:17:24.925
The secret of the wish.

1019
01:17:25.758 --> 01:17:27.008
So I wished for it.

1020
01:17:27.092 --> 01:17:30.508
Or someone
wished for it for me.

1021
01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.425
Tell me what you wish for.
Your Highness.

1022
01:17:34.508 --> 01:17:37.050
and I will show you
how it works.

1023
01:17:38.467 --> 01:17:41.133
I wish for things
one cannot attain.

1024
01:17:41.217 --> 01:17:42.758
Like what?

1025
01:17:44.758 --> 01:17:47.175
All of my land to be returned.

1026
01:17:47.258 --> 01:17:48.967
My ancestral realm.

1027
01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:51.342
The Bialyian Dynasty.

1028
01:17:51.425 --> 01:17:54.300
And for all the heathens
who dare trod upon it

1029
01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:59.592
to be kept out forever.
so that its glory may be renewed.

1030
01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:01.633
You wish for that?

1031
01:18:01.717 --> 01:18:04.592
I wish for that deeply.

1032
01:18:09.842 --> 01:18:12.133
Your wish is granted.

1033
01:18:12.217 --> 01:18:15.425
And in return.
I will take your oil.

1034
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:23.758
You truly delight me.

1035
01:18:23.842 --> 01:18:26.092
You know so little.

1036
01:18:26.175 --> 01:18:29.425
I sold my oil to the Saudis.

1037
01:18:29.508 --> 01:18:30.925
You are a silly man.

1038
01:18:39.508 --> 01:18:41.550
Then I will take
your security team

1039
01:18:41.633 --> 01:18:43.508
and leave you here
with nothing to defend yourself

1040
01:18:43.592 --> 01:18:47.258
against the wrath you most
certainly will face.

1041
01:19:27.425 --> 01:19:30.425
Stop! Stop the car!

1042
01:19:30.508 --> 01:19:31.800
What are you doing?

1043
01:19:31.883 --> 01:19:34.175
Stop what you're doing now!
I'm telling you.

1044
01:19:34.258 --> 01:19:36.133
I command you to stop!

1045
01:19:37.092 --> 01:19:38.175
Stop!

1046
01:19:38.258 --> 01:19:40.508
Stop! Stop!

1047
01:19:42.508 --> 01:19:45.342
<i>This
unbelievable and unexplainable wall</i>

1048
01:19:45.425 --> 01:19:47.050
<i>appears to somehow be the work</i>

1049
01:19:47.133 --> 01:19:49.050
<i>of Emir Said Bin Abydos.</i>

1050

<i>The government is reporting

1051
01:19:51.925 --> 01:19:54.175
<i>acknowledging his claim

1052
01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:06.675
You okay?

1053
01:20:06.758 --> 01:20:09.175
I'm fine.

1054
01:20:09.258 --> 01:20:13.050
You keep saying that. but...

1055
01:20:15.217 --> 01:20:16.300
That was him!

1056
01:20:16.383 --> 01:20:18.467
That was Max Lord.

1057
01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.633
Get rid of them. please.

1058
01:21:24.383 --> 01:21:25.467
I got this.

1059
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:26.508
What?

1060
01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:29.008
Diana!

1061
01:21:42.925 --> 01:21:44.717
The brakes still work.

1062
01:23:59.383 --> 01:24:00.925
Max Lord.

1063
01:24:01.008 --> 01:24:04.342
you're putting yourself and
everyone else in grave danger.

1064
01:24:04.425 --> 01:24:06.300
I need you
to give me the stone.

1065
01:24:06.383 --> 01:24:08.467
What happened to it?

1066
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:10.508
You're looking at it.

1067
01:24:16.717 --> 01:24:17.883
Whoa!

1068
01:25:08.842 --> 01:25:10.383
Steve!

1069
01:25:10.967 --> 01:25:11.925
Diana!

1070
01:26:11.842 --> 01:26:14.467
So who's the next
closest person with oil?

1071
01:26:34.217 --> 01:26:37.467
Diana. Diana.

1072
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:42.508
My God.
What's going on with you?

1073
01:26:42.592 --> 01:26:45.258
<i>A truly bizarre phenomenon
that is being called the Divine Wall.</i>

1074
01:26:45.342 --> 01:26:46.842
What is happening?

1075
01:26:46.925 --> 01:26:48.467
<i>It's an unexplainable event</i>

1076
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:50.425
<i>that now sees
Egypt's poorest communities</i>

1077
01:26:50.508 --> 01:26:52.842
<i>entirely cut off from their
only supply of fresh water.</i>

1078
01:26:52.925 --> 01:26:55.717
<i>An already
tense situation now escalating</i>

1079
01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:00.050
<i>as the Soviet Union announces they
will recognize the Emir's claim.</i>

1080
01:27:00.133 --> 01:27:01.675
- Oh. no.
- <i>The United States.</i>

1081
01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:04.133
<i>a longtime ally of Egypt.
has declared</i>

1082
01:27:04.217 --> 01:27:06.842
<i>their intention to side
with the government.</i>

1083
01:27:06.925 --> 01:27:09.217
<i>Bedlam on the home front
now as well</i>

1084
01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:11.800
<i>as the shocking news
that American businessman</i>

1085

<i>Max Lord has somehow

1086

<i>of over half

1087

<i>The instability in the

1088

<i>in a nationwide run on gas.</i>

1089
01:27:22.342 --> 01:27:24.300
<i>and experts are girding themselves...</i>

1090
01:27:24.383 --> 01:27:25.383
Hello?

1091
01:27:25.467 --> 01:27:26.800
Barbara. it's Diana.

1092
01:27:26.883 --> 01:27:30.175
- Did you...
- <i>Yeah. Uh. well. sort of.</i>

1093
01:27:30.258 --> 01:27:32.800
<i>I haven't figured out
exactly what the stone is.</i>

1094
01:27:32.883 --> 01:27:35.800
<i>but I've found
historical images of it.</i>

1095
01:27:35.883 --> 01:27:36.800
From where?

1096
01:27:36.883 --> 01:27:38.342
That's the weird thing.

1097
01:27:38.425 --> 01:27:40.092
From everywhere.

1098
01:27:40.175 --> 01:27:43.633
It first appeared in the Indus
Valley almost 4.000 years ago.

1099
01:27:43.717 --> 01:27:46.425
It popped up again
in Carthage in 146 BC.

1100
01:27:46.508 --> 01:27:48.342
Kush. 4 AD.

1101
01:27:48.425 --> 01:27:50.342
Romulus. the last
Emperor of Rome.

1102
01:27:50.425 --> 01:27:53.425
he had it on him when
he was assassinated in 476.

1103
01:27:53.508 --> 01:27:57.508
<i>The last record is in some
previously unknown dead city</i>

1104
01:27:57.592 --> 01:27:59.008
<i>near Dzibilchaltun.</i>

1105
01:27:59.092 --> 01:28:00.842
- The Mayans.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1106
01:28:00.925 --> 01:28:03.050
Anyway. it just led me
to a bunch of dead ends.

1107
01:28:03.133 --> 01:28:06.800
and my last lead
is not that promising.

1108
01:28:06.883 --> 01:28:08.050
What's that?

1109
01:28:08.133 --> 01:28:09.800
<i>A flier I found.</i>

1110
01:28:09.883 --> 01:28:11.675
Grabbed it at the embassy.

1111
01:28:11.758 --> 01:28:14.592
Some guy advertising
to be a Mayan shaman.

1112
01:28:14.675 --> 01:28:18.217
But he literally teaches a course
in a squat next to Galaxy Records.

1113
01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:21.050
- And he knows about the stone?
- <i>So he says.</i>

1114
01:28:21.133 --> 01:28:23.258
I'm gonna go there
in the morning.

1115
01:28:23.342 --> 01:28:27.050
Okay. we'll meet you there.
And thank you.

1116
01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.675
What is it?

1117
01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:34.883
The stone has
traveled the world

1118
01:28:34.967 --> 01:28:36.717
to seemingly random
and different places.

1119
01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.217
- but they all have one thing in common.
- What?

1120
01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:42.342
Their civilizations collapsed
catastrophically.

1121
01:28:42.425 --> 01:28:44.717
Without a trace as to why.

1122
01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.592
You don't think
the stone could have...

1123
01:28:47.258 --> 01:28:48.633
Do you?

1124
01:28:48.717 --> 01:28:50.925
I don't know
what to think. Steve.

1125
01:28:51.842 --> 01:28:54.758
I can only hope I'm wrong.

1126
01:29:22.508 --> 01:29:24.717
Babajide?

1127
01:29:29.842 --> 01:29:31.925
- That was fast.
- Morning.

1128
01:29:34.008 --> 01:29:35.508
Hello.

1129
01:29:37.008 --> 01:29:39.133
One second.

1130
01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:43.175
So you're a Mayan?

1131
01:29:43.258 --> 01:29:45.675
What? I'm a citizen
of the world.

1132
01:29:45.758 --> 01:29:47.133
It says your name is Frank.

1133
01:29:47.217 --> 01:29:50.467
Yeah. Most of what I know
is a past-life thing.

1134
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:51.800
So that's a no.

1135
01:29:51.883 --> 01:29:54.217
But to answer
your question. yes.

1136
01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:57.508
My great-great-grandfather

1137
01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:59.175
left me this.

1138
01:29:59.258 --> 01:30:02.342
I don't know everything about
it. but I have been warned

1139
01:30:02.425 --> 01:30:03.883
I'm better off that way.

1140
01:30:03.967 --> 01:30:07.550
What I do know is.
it destroyed our people

1141
01:30:07.633 --> 01:30:08.967
in a matter of months.

1142
01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:11.633
The few survivors.
they buried the stone.

1143
01:30:11.717 --> 01:30:14.800
never to be exhumed
under any circumstances.

1144
01:30:14.883 --> 01:30:17.633
- Can I see that?
- Be my guest.

1145
01:30:32.008 --> 01:30:33.425
What?

1146
01:30:34.133 --> 01:30:35.175
What is it?

1147
01:30:39.092 --> 01:30:40.842
<i>Dechalafrea Ero.</i>

1148
01:30:40.925 --> 01:30:42.008
What's that?

1149
01:30:42.092 --> 01:30:44.383
A very bad God.

1150
01:30:44.467 --> 01:30:47.008
The God of Lies.
Dolos. Mendacius.

1151
01:30:47.092 --> 01:30:49.342
Duke of Deception.
He's been called by many names.

1152
01:30:49.425 --> 01:30:51.758
But if he's the one
who empowered that stone.

1153
01:30:51.842 --> 01:30:53.217
there has to be a trick.

1154
01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.258
What do lies have to do
with granting wishes?

1155
01:30:55.342 --> 01:30:57.717
It seems more like
a Dreamstone to me.

1156
01:30:58.758 --> 01:31:01.383
Wishes with a trick.

1157
01:31:01.467 --> 01:31:03.925
"The Monkey's Paw."

1158
01:31:04.008 --> 01:31:05.717
Beware what you wish for.

1159
01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:09.133
It grants your wish.
but takes your most valued possession.

1160
01:31:10.467 --> 01:31:12.300
Diana. your powers.

1161
01:31:12.383 --> 01:31:13.842
No. that doesn't
make any sense.

1162
01:31:13.925 --> 01:31:15.883
What's more precious
than what you wish for?

1163
01:31:15.967 --> 01:31:17.175
How do we stop this?

1164
01:31:17.258 --> 01:31:18.717
The legend said

1165
01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.800
it can only be stopped
by destroying the stone itself

1166
01:31:20.883 --> 01:31:22.800
or give back what was given.
My people couldn't do the first thing

1167
01:31:22.883 --> 01:31:24.467
and refused to do the second.

1168
01:31:25.425 --> 01:31:27.258
Now the culture's destroyed.

1169
01:31:27.342 --> 01:31:29.217
Wiped from the face
of the Earth.

1170
01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:32.258
- No one renounced their wish?
- But the stone is already destroyed.

1171
01:31:32.342 --> 01:31:34.133
What? When?

1172
01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.633
"You're looking at it."

1173
01:31:38.717 --> 01:31:42.508
"You're looking at it." That's
what Max Lord said to me.

1174
01:31:42.592 --> 01:31:44.300
Maybe it's him.

1175
01:31:44.383 --> 01:31:46.300
He's become it somehow.

1176
01:31:46.383 --> 01:31:48.258
But how would
that happen?

1177
01:31:48.342 --> 01:31:50.758
I mean. if he wished for...

1178
01:31:59.258 --> 01:32:02.175
No. that's crazy. No.

1179
01:32:02.258 --> 01:32:04.425
If we destroy it.

1180
01:32:04.508 --> 01:32:06.550
if we destroy him...

1181
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:08.800
all the wishes go back.

1182
01:32:08.883 --> 01:32:10.467
What are you
talking about? No.

1183
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:12.342
I'm not gonna be
a part of that. No.

1184
01:32:12.425 --> 01:32:14.258
Or if everyone
renounces their wish.

1185
01:32:14.342 --> 01:32:17.758
No. there has to be
a better way.

1186
01:32:17.842 --> 01:32:19.258
No.

1187
01:32:22.842 --> 01:32:24.217
She's right.

1188
01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:26.425
We don't know enough.
We just don't know enough.

1189
01:32:26.508 --> 01:32:29.467
But what we do know is that we need
to stop him before he grants any more.

1190
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:33.300
Stopping him might
not be enough. Diana.

1191
01:32:33.383 --> 01:32:34.967
Wishes have been made.

1192
01:32:37.175 --> 01:32:38.550
Barbara?

1193
01:32:40.008 --> 01:32:41.425
Barbara?

1194
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:52.133
Like I want any of
these people in the club anyway.

1195
01:32:52.217 --> 01:32:53.717
Can we tell them
they're not invited?

1196
01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.008
No. sir.

1197
01:32:55.092 --> 01:32:56.925
- The FCC said we couldn't...
- Oh. the FCC.

1198
01:32:57.008 --> 01:33:00.800
The BBB. the FBD.

1199
01:33:00.883 --> 01:33:03.633
It's a conspiracy
against my success.

1200
01:33:03.717 --> 01:33:05.800
They're jealous. That's why.
Who's next?

1201
01:33:05.883 --> 01:33:08.592
- Who's next?
- Well. everyone you asked for.

1202
01:33:08.675 --> 01:33:10.342
Lai Zhong. Mr. Khalaji.

1203
01:33:10.425 --> 01:33:13.508
- that televangelist who stole your slot.
- Mmm.

1204
01:33:13.592 --> 01:33:15.217
And you have Alistair
for the night.

1205
01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:18.508
Alistair? Again?
How many weekends do I have?

1206
01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:19.633
What? What? When?

1207
01:33:19.717 --> 01:33:21.133
Tonight?

1208
01:33:25.925 --> 01:33:27.092
He's here already.

1209
01:33:27.175 --> 01:33:28.925
His mom is with her boyfriend.

1210
01:33:34.425 --> 01:33:36.675
Send in Mr. Zhong. please.

1211
01:33:36.758 --> 01:33:39.675
And buy Alistair a pony.

1212
01:33:39.758 --> 01:33:42.217
No! A race car.
Get him a race car.

1213
01:33:44.633 --> 01:33:46.717
Let's get to it. Lai.

1214
01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.467
Tell me...

1215
01:33:49.217 --> 01:33:50.758
what do you want?

1216
01:33:51.883 --> 01:33:54.883
What do you wish for?

1217
01:33:54.967 --> 01:33:57.050
- Me? Truly?
- Mmm-hmm.

1218
01:33:57.133 --> 01:33:59.050
Mmm-hmm.

1219
01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:01.883
The Soviets have sided
with Iran.

1220
01:34:01.967 --> 01:34:05.258
Iraq is preparing to defend
ourselves. as unrest spreads.

1221
01:34:05.342 --> 01:34:08.383
And you need? What do you...

1222
01:34:08.467 --> 01:34:10.383
What do you wish for?

1223
01:34:10.467 --> 01:34:12.675
Consider the sex tape gone.

1224
01:34:12.758 --> 01:34:14.758
And God darn it.
if I have to keep doing this

1225
01:34:14.842 --> 01:34:17.800
one by one. by one. by one...

1226
01:34:17.883 --> 01:34:19.425
- How's your health?
- Well...

1227
01:34:19.508 --> 01:34:20.675
Forget that.

1228
01:34:20.758 --> 01:34:22.842
But I will take
your entire congregation

1229
01:34:22.925 --> 01:34:24.300
and your time slot.

1230
01:34:24.383 --> 01:34:25.383
Let me ask you.

1231
01:34:25.467 --> 01:34:27.550
when they pray.
is there any way

1232
01:34:27.633 --> 01:34:30.883
I could get all of them to...

1233
01:34:30.967 --> 01:34:32.258
join hands with me?

1234
01:34:32.342 --> 01:34:34.050
And simply say. "I wish"

1235
01:34:34.133 --> 01:34:36.133
rather than. "I pray"?

1236
01:34:36.217 --> 01:34:37.592
Would that even work?

1237
01:34:37.675 --> 01:34:38.592
I don't...

1238
01:34:38.675 --> 01:34:40.008
I need to find a way

1239
01:34:40.092 --> 01:34:42.925
to touch a lot of people
at the same time.

1240
01:34:44.175 --> 01:34:45.925
Sir. The police are here.

1241
01:34:46.008 --> 01:34:48.258
They're challenging the
jurisdiction of your security team.

1242
01:34:48.342 --> 01:34:50.342
Oh. God!

1243
01:34:50.425 --> 01:34:53.592
This isn't working.
Bring in someone new.

1244
01:34:53.675 --> 01:34:54.842
And my son.

1245
01:34:54.925 --> 01:34:56.925
You. beat it.

1246
01:35:06.425 --> 01:35:08.217
Alistair!

1247
01:35:10.258 --> 01:35:12.717
I've missed you. buddy.

1248
01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.675
Come. Sit down with Daddy.
I'm sorry.

1249
01:35:16.342 --> 01:35:21.425
But. your dad is on the absolute
precipice of everything.

1250
01:35:21.508 --> 01:35:23.842
Remember when I told you
that I would be number one?

1251
01:35:23.925 --> 01:35:25.800
Do you remember? Your dad?

1252
01:35:25.883 --> 01:35:28.092
Well. I'm inches away. Huh?

1253
01:35:28.175 --> 01:35:30.133
I know it's hard. I know.

1254
01:35:30.217 --> 01:35:31.633
But listen.

1255
01:35:31.717 --> 01:35:33.967
I also know what you wish for.
and I wish for it. too.

1256
01:35:34.050 --> 01:35:36.175
Do you hear that?
I wish for it. too.

1257
01:35:36.258 --> 01:35:37.592
I just wish
I could be with you...

1258
01:35:37.675 --> 01:35:39.258
No!

1259
01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.508
You don't use your
one wish like that. Alistair.

1260
01:35:43.592 --> 01:35:46.467
You don't wish for something
that you already have.

1261
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:49.217
You wish for greatness.
for success.

1262
01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:51.508
That's why
I'm doing all of this.

1263
01:35:51.592 --> 01:35:56.467
Don't you see that my greatness
is your greatness? Huh?

1264
01:36:00.050 --> 01:36:01.925
Then I wish for your greatness.

1265
01:36:02.008 --> 01:36:04.050
No. No!

1266
01:36:16.883 --> 01:36:18.425
Thank you.

1267
01:36:19.758 --> 01:36:21.842
I love you so much.

1268
01:36:21.925 --> 01:36:23.800
And I promise you. one day.

1269
01:36:23.883 --> 01:36:26.342
everything is going
to make sense.

1270
01:36:26.425 --> 01:36:29.342
And one day. you'll thank me.

1271
01:36:30.717 --> 01:36:33.425
But right now. I. uh...

1272
01:36:33.508 --> 01:36:36.842
Right now. I need you to stay here
with Emerson. okay? I'll be back.

1273
01:36:36.925 --> 01:36:39.175
You stay here.

1274
01:36:50.133 --> 01:36:51.550
You. You.

1275
01:36:51.633 --> 01:36:53.175
Yes. sir?

1276
01:36:53.258 --> 01:36:55.508
Don't you wish I had an audience
with the President today?

1277
01:36:55.592 --> 01:36:57.383
Of course I do.

1278
01:36:57.467 --> 01:36:59.217
And can I tell you how happy I am
that you value my opinion. sir.

1279
01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:01.633
Wait a minute.
Have I asked for your wish before?

1280
01:37:01.717 --> 01:37:03.800
Yesterday. A Porsche.

1281
01:37:03.883 --> 01:37:05.383
What is it with you aides
and Porsches?

1282
01:37:05.925 --> 01:37:07.175
You!

1283
01:37:07.258 --> 01:37:08.675
Hi.

1284
01:37:08.758 --> 01:37:10.800
This way.

1285
01:37:15.592 --> 01:37:16.592
How's traffic?

1286
01:37:16.675 --> 01:37:18.342
Huh? Terrible.

1287
01:37:18.425 --> 01:37:20.050
Don't you wish it wasn't?

1288
01:37:20.133 --> 01:37:23.092
And that everywhere you went
parted like the great Red Sea?

1289
01:37:23.175 --> 01:37:27.467
Of course I wish that.
Sadly. ain't gonna happen.

1290
01:37:35.342 --> 01:37:36.675
Hey. you! Stop!

1291
01:37:36.758 --> 01:37:39.008
Come on in. It's not safe.

1292
01:37:39.092 --> 01:37:41.092
There's a riot
at the Saudi Embassy

1293
01:37:41.175 --> 01:37:43.758
and there are Porsches
racing up and down the street.

1294
01:37:43.842 --> 01:37:44.925
Come on. It's mad.

1295
01:37:45.008 --> 01:37:47.925
But my cows.

1296
01:37:48.008 --> 01:37:51.633
I told a man I wanted a farm.

1297
01:37:51.717 --> 01:37:54.133
I didn't mean here.

1298
01:37:58.550 --> 01:38:00.967
I'll be right back.

1299
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:01.675
Diana. I know it's been hard.

1300
01:39:01.758 --> 01:39:04.008
You don't know. You don't.

1301
01:39:04.092 --> 01:39:05.967
But we...

1302
01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:07.467
It can't go on like this.

1303
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:09.717
- I can't talk about this.
- We have to talk about it.

1304
01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.467
Steve. I can't talk about this!

1305
01:39:17.092 --> 01:39:19.592
I give everything I have.
every day.

1306
01:39:19.675 --> 01:39:21.550
And I'm happy to.

1307
01:39:21.633 --> 01:39:25.050
But this one thing...

1308
01:39:25.133 --> 01:39:29.800
You're all that I've wanted
for so long.

1309
01:39:29.883 --> 01:39:33.550
You're the only joy I've had
or even asked for.

1310
01:39:34.383 --> 01:39:36.092
I am so sorry...

1311
01:39:38.133 --> 01:39:40.842
but that's crazy.

1312
01:39:40.925 --> 01:39:44.842
There's a world
out there full of

1313
01:39:44.925 --> 01:39:46.217
so many better guys. for one.

1314
01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:48.550
I mean. how about this guy?
How about him?

1315
01:39:48.633 --> 01:39:51.175
I don't want him. I want you.

1316
01:39:51.258 --> 01:39:54.675
Why. for once. can't I just
have this one thing. Steve?

1317
01:39:54.758 --> 01:39:56.425
This one thing.

1318
01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:01.717
I'm not sure we have a choice.

1319
01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:06.383
Well. I do have a choice.

1320
01:40:06.467 --> 01:40:07.967
And I can't give you up.
I can't.

1321
01:40:08.050 --> 01:40:10.425
So I won't.
So we need to stop him

1322
01:40:10.508 --> 01:40:12.717
so we can figure that out.

1323
01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.092
There has to be another way.

1324
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:17.092
Has to.

1325
01:40:30.175 --> 01:40:31.258
Wow.

1326
01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:35.217
This is incredible.

1327
01:40:40.175 --> 01:40:41.300
What's that?

1328
01:40:42.675 --> 01:40:44.383
From my culture.

1329
01:40:44.467 --> 01:40:49.133
The armor of an ancient Amazon warrior.
One of our greatest.

1330
01:40:49.217 --> 01:40:51.883
It's huge. This whole thing?

1331
01:40:53.967 --> 01:40:55.300
What is it made out of?

1332
01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:57.258
Here. Let me show you.

1333
01:40:58.050 --> 01:40:59.883
Give me your hand.

1334
01:40:59.967 --> 01:41:01.592
What are you talking about?
I haven't lied.

1335
01:41:01.675 --> 01:41:04.300
The Lasso does more than
just make you tell the truth.

1336
01:41:04.383 --> 01:41:06.508
It can make you see it. too.

1337
01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:14.008
<i>Her name was Asteria.</i>

1338
01:41:14.092 --> 01:41:15.967
<i>She was our greatest warrior.</i>

1339
01:41:16.050 --> 01:41:20.467
<i>When mankind enslaved the
Amazons. my mother freed us.</i>

1340
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:23.592
<i>But someone had to stay behind
to hold back the tide of men</i>

1341
01:41:23.675 --> 01:41:26.842
<i>so the others
could escape to Themyscira.</i>

1342
01:41:26.925 --> 01:41:28.967
<i>My people gave up
all of their armor</i>

1343
01:41:29.050 --> 01:41:34.300
<i>to make her one suit strong
enough to take on the whole world.</i>

1344
01:41:34.383 --> 01:41:39.758
<i>And Asteria sacrificed herself
for a better day for others.</i>

1345
01:41:43.675 --> 01:41:45.092
That's...

1346
01:41:46.883 --> 01:41:48.008
That's incredible.

1347
01:41:48.092 --> 01:41:51.133
When I came here.
I searched for her.

1348
01:41:51.217 --> 01:41:54.633
But all I could find
was her armor.

1349
01:41:54.717 --> 01:41:56.300
What is this?

1350
01:41:57.508 --> 01:41:59.300
Where is he going?

1351
01:41:59.383 --> 01:42:00.800
Oh. no.

1352
01:42:20.508 --> 01:42:22.217
Diana. Diana!
What are you doing?

1353
01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:23.967
- Where are you going?
- Steve. I'm going. You need to stay.

1354
01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:26.050
No. No. Listen to me.

1355
01:42:26.133 --> 01:42:27.425
You're getting weaker. Diana.

1356
01:42:27.508 --> 01:42:28.758
- What if you fall?
- I won't.

1357
01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:31.758
You might. We don't know that.

1358
01:42:31.842 --> 01:42:34.217
There has to be another way in.

1359
01:42:46.717 --> 01:42:48.758
Everything okay. Mr. President?

1360
01:42:49.175 --> 01:42:50.258
Yes.

1361
01:42:51.133 --> 01:42:53.467
Something very strange. I...

1362
01:42:53.550 --> 01:42:57.175
I thought I was somewhere else entirely.
Suddenly...

1363
01:42:58.508 --> 01:43:01.342
Anyway. Hectic times.

1364
01:43:02.592 --> 01:43:04.883
Give us a minute.

1365
01:43:10.675 --> 01:43:11.675
Excuse me.

1366
01:43:15.133 --> 01:43:16.800
- Carl.
- Diana.

1367
01:43:16.883 --> 01:43:18.592
- Hi.
- What a pleasure.

1368
01:43:18.675 --> 01:43:20.800
Good to see you.
How have you been?

1369
01:43:20.883 --> 01:43:22.175
- Good.
- This is Steve.

1370
01:43:22.258 --> 01:43:23.925
Steve. this is Carl.
My colleague.

1371
01:43:24.008 --> 01:43:26.383
- Hi.
- Hi.

1372
01:43:26.467 --> 01:43:27.758
Shall we. uh...

1373
01:43:27.842 --> 01:43:30.300
Yeah. we shall.

1374
01:43:30.383 --> 01:43:31.925
I'm sorry. Mr. Lord.

1375
01:43:32.008 --> 01:43:34.300
In fact. I don't even know
what we're supposed to discuss.

1376
01:43:34.383 --> 01:43:35.633
Exactly that. Mr. President.

1377
01:43:35.717 --> 01:43:39.633
These hectic days.
hectic times.

1378
01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.092
And you.

1379
01:43:42.175 --> 01:43:43.467
<i>These aren't
exactly my favorite</i>

1380
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:45.258
of the busts on display here.

1381
01:43:45.342 --> 01:43:48.633
but it's a little picture of my top
ten. maybe top five at a push.

1382
01:43:48.717 --> 01:43:50.925
Oh. here's something up ahead
that will interest you.

1383
01:43:51.008 --> 01:43:55.883
These are floor tiles originally
laid by none other than Jan Lincoln.

1384
01:43:55.967 --> 01:43:58.467
a little-known descendent
of Abraham.

1385
01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:01.133
You're having some troubles?

1386
01:44:01.217 --> 01:44:02.675
Everywhere suddenly.

1387
01:44:02.758 --> 01:44:04.633
Cuba. Egypt.

1388
01:44:04.717 --> 01:44:06.217
even here.

1389
01:44:06.883 --> 01:44:08.383
But Russia...

1390
01:44:08.467 --> 01:44:10.508
- very troublesome.
- Mmm.

1391
01:44:12.342 --> 01:44:13.758
I appreciate your concern.

1392
01:44:13.842 --> 01:44:16.050
but all the money in the world
won't help us now.

1393
01:44:16.175 --> 01:44:18.508
It's not money I'm offering.

1394
01:44:18.592 --> 01:44:20.133
You.

1395
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:23.008
You are a man of faith.

1396
01:44:23.092 --> 01:44:26.008
and I have been
very blessed lately.

1397
01:44:29.342 --> 01:44:32.092
I want to share
my blessing with you.

1398
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:35.717
The power of positive thinking.

1399
01:44:39.508 --> 01:44:41.633
Now...

1400
01:44:41.717 --> 01:44:45.175
tell me. Mr. President.
what do you need?

1401
01:44:45.258 --> 01:44:48.717
And you're not speaking to me
here. but to the universe.

1402
01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:51.175
What do you wish for?

1403
01:44:53.425 --> 01:44:56.175
What is there to wish for but more?

1404
01:44:56.258 --> 01:44:58.383
More nuclear weapons.
More than they have.

1405
01:44:58.467 --> 01:45:00.092
Closer to 'em.

1406
01:45:00.175 --> 01:45:02.050
If I just had that in place.

1407
01:45:02.133 --> 01:45:04.258
then they would
have to listen to us.

1408
01:45:04.342 --> 01:45:07.550
A nice thought.
And I grant you...

1409
01:45:10.383 --> 01:45:11.717
Oh... Oh. my...

1410
01:45:16.675 --> 01:45:20.008
And you know what I'd like?

1411
01:45:20.092 --> 01:45:24.217
I would want all of your power.
influence. authority.

1412
01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:25.633
All the respect you command

1413
01:45:25.717 --> 01:45:30.050
and the command
everyone must respect.

1414
01:45:35.758 --> 01:45:38.717
I mean. what else is there?

1415
01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:41.592
Now. tell your people
I would appreciate

1416
01:45:41.675 --> 01:45:45.425
absolutely no interference
whatsoever.

1417
01:45:45.508 --> 01:45:47.800
No taxes. no rule of law.
no limits.

1418
01:45:47.883 --> 01:45:52.550
Treat me like a foreign nation
with absolute autonomy.

1419
01:45:53.842 --> 01:45:55.175
Very good. sir.

1420
01:45:55.258 --> 01:45:56.383
Right away.

1421
01:46:03.967 --> 01:46:05.133
What's this?

1422
01:46:05.217 --> 01:46:06.467
Global Broadcast Satellite.

1423
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:08.092
Top-secret program
that enables us

1424
01:46:08.175 --> 01:46:10.175
to override any broadcast
system in the world

1425
01:46:10.258 --> 01:46:14.133
in case we need direct contact
with the people of an enemy state.

1426
01:46:14.217 --> 01:46:15.383
So what does that mean?

1427
01:46:15.467 --> 01:46:17.758
You're taking over
everyone's TVs?

1428
01:46:17.842 --> 01:46:19.008
How?

1429
01:46:19.092 --> 01:46:20.550
It uses
particle beam technology.

1430
01:46:20.633 --> 01:46:22.550
just like
the Star Wars program.

1431
01:46:22.633 --> 01:46:25.925
Apparently. it bathes the landscape
in a signal of particles that goes in

1432
01:46:26.008 --> 01:46:28.800
and fiddles with
any technology it touches.

1433
01:46:28.883 --> 01:46:31.717
New or old.
Broadcast whatever you want.

1434
01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:33.300
Very impressive.

1435
01:46:33.383 --> 01:46:37.883
You said "touches"?

1436
01:46:37.967 --> 01:46:41.050
As in the particles
you are sending...

1437
01:46:43.633 --> 01:46:48.258
are touching everything?

1438
01:46:48.342 --> 01:46:49.800
It's a figure of speech.

1439
01:46:49.883 --> 01:46:51.467
but yes.

1440
01:46:51.550 --> 01:46:52.967
- That's how it was explained to me.
- I need immediate access

1441
01:46:53.050 --> 01:46:55.633
to this satellite.
And a chopper

1442
01:46:55.717 --> 01:46:56.925
to get me there.

1443
01:46:57.008 --> 01:46:58.300
Yes. sir. Right away.

1444
01:47:08.925 --> 01:47:10.842
Well. aren't you resourceful?

1445
01:47:10.925 --> 01:47:14.217
Come with me before you do
any more damage. Max.

1446
01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:15.883
No. I don't think so.

1447
01:47:15.967 --> 01:47:17.633
Remove this woman. please...

1448
01:47:17.717 --> 01:47:19.592
permanently.

1449
01:47:28.425 --> 01:47:30.758
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

1450
01:47:33.925 --> 01:47:35.092
No. Steve. You can't use that.

1451
01:47:35.175 --> 01:47:37.758
It's not their fault.

1452
01:48:25.383 --> 01:48:26.717
That's neat.

1453
01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:01.633
Barbara.

1454
01:49:04.675 --> 01:49:06.592
I can't let you do this. Diana.

1455
01:49:37.258 --> 01:49:40.050
Barbara. What...

1456
01:49:40.133 --> 01:49:43.133
- How...
- I can't let you stop Max.

1457
01:49:43.217 --> 01:49:45.883
You're not the only one
with something to lose.

1458
01:49:49.425 --> 01:49:51.800
Turns out wishing
to be like you...

1459
01:49:53.008 --> 01:49:55.092
came with some surprises.

1460
01:49:58.592 --> 01:49:59.842
Hands up.

1461
01:49:59.925 --> 01:50:01.175
- Hands up.
- Hands up. hands up.

1462
01:50:01.258 --> 01:50:02.342
Hands up!

1463
01:50:02.425 --> 01:50:04.258
- Hands up!
- Now! Now. now!

1464
01:50:17.842 --> 01:50:19.217
Open fire!

1465
01:50:33.967 --> 01:50:37.175
Oh. how sweet.
defending your love. Huh?

1466
01:50:37.258 --> 01:50:40.133
What do you wish for?
Do you wanna be a real boy?

1467
01:50:40.217 --> 01:50:41.633
No.

1468
01:50:41.717 --> 01:50:44.050
Just not to be handcuffed to
you. but now I am.

1469
01:50:51.675 --> 01:50:53.467
I just learned that.

1470
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:06.967
Barbara. stop!

1471
01:51:09.467 --> 01:51:10.633
Ahh!

1472
01:51:18.258 --> 01:51:19.342
Listen.

1473
01:51:19.425 --> 01:51:20.383
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

1474
01:51:20.467 --> 01:51:21.758
I'm not what you think.

1475
01:51:21.842 --> 01:51:23.092
You can't possibly
understand or handle...

1476
01:51:23.175 --> 01:51:25.258
Oh. I can't
possibly understand?

1477
01:51:28.842 --> 01:51:29.967
Oh...

1478
01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:31.675
Dumb little old me.

1479
01:51:31.758 --> 01:51:33.258
Dumb little. poor little

1480
01:51:33.342 --> 01:51:35.300
nothing. nobody me.

1481
01:51:35.383 --> 01:51:36.925
I couldn't possibly handle it.

1482
01:51:37.008 --> 01:51:39.633
No. Barbara.
That's not what I'm saying.

1483
01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:48.425
Well.
I'm handling it beautifully.

1484
01:51:48.508 --> 01:51:50.217
And I'm not giving it back!

1485
01:52:14.508 --> 01:52:15.425
Go.

1486
01:52:16.425 --> 01:52:17.467
Run!

1487
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:19.883
Everyone. stand down.

1488
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:22.800
Nobody hurts her.

1489
01:52:24.383 --> 01:52:26.633
They couldn't if they tried.

1490
01:52:31.050 --> 01:52:33.092
You've always
had everything.

1491
01:52:33.175 --> 01:52:36.175
while people like me
have had nothing.

1492
01:52:36.258 --> 01:52:40.675
Well. now it's my turn.
And you are not taking it from me. Ever!

1493
01:52:42.258 --> 01:52:44.008
But what is it costing you?

1494
01:52:44.092 --> 01:52:45.550
What is it costing me?

1495
01:52:45.633 --> 01:52:49.008
If it's the monkey's paw.
it takes as much as it gives.

1496
01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:53.925
Yes. you're strong...

1497
01:52:54.008 --> 01:52:57.050
but what did you lose. Barbara?

1498
01:52:57.133 --> 01:53:00.675
Where's your warmth. your joy.

1499
01:53:00.758 --> 01:53:02.258
your humanity?

1500
01:53:02.342 --> 01:53:06.217
You're attacking innocent men.
Barbara. Look at yourself.

1501
01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:08.217
Forget about me.

1502
01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:10.550
What is it costing you?

1503
01:53:15.592 --> 01:53:18.092
Yeah. yeah.

1504
01:53:18.217 --> 01:53:20.092
That's right.

1505
01:53:20.842 --> 01:53:22.925
Get used to it.

1506
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:28.008
If you go after Max Lord...

1507
01:53:28.758 --> 01:53:31.092
or hurt him in any way.

1508
01:53:31.175 --> 01:53:32.717
I will destroy you.

1509
01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:33.842
Barbara!

1510
01:53:51.133 --> 01:53:53.008
Are you all right?

1511
01:54:14.383 --> 01:54:16.550
Room for one more?

1512
01:54:25.050 --> 01:54:26.342
<i>Sir. you need to wait.</i>

1513
01:54:26.425 --> 01:54:27.717
The President has
a meeting right now.

1514
01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:28.717
We need
to see the President.

1515
01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:30.342
He needs to be told.

1516
01:54:30.425 --> 01:54:32.258
- This is a matter of life and death.
- What is going on?

1517
01:54:32.342 --> 01:54:35.258
The Soviets' early detection
system picked up our new nukes.

1518
01:54:35.342 --> 01:54:37.300
<i>What new nukes?</i>

1519
01:54:37.383 --> 01:54:39.842
<i>A hundred warheads just went
online. ready to launch.</i>

1520
01:54:39.925 --> 01:54:42.133
<i>They're taking this
as an act of war.</i>

1521
01:54:42.217 --> 01:54:43.758
Prepping to return fire.

1522
01:54:43.842 --> 01:54:45.467
Return? What?

1523
01:54:45.550 --> 01:54:47.508
We haven't done anything.

1524
01:54:47.592 --> 01:54:49.092
That's not how it looks.

1525
01:54:49.175 --> 01:54:51.592
And we'd fire for less.

1526
01:54:54.508 --> 01:54:56.175
Are you kidding me?

1527
01:54:56.258 --> 01:54:58.133
You blew through that light right there!
You didn't even see!

1528
01:54:58.217 --> 01:54:59.550
How do you not see that?

1529
01:54:59.633 --> 01:55:01.467
Riots across
the world erupting

1530
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:05.217
as America and the Soviet Union
end communication.

1531
01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:07.217
declaring war!

1532
01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:08.883
No one knows
any more than that.

1533
01:55:08.967 --> 01:55:10.967
But as you can imagine
with what's at stake.

1534
01:55:11.050 --> 01:55:13.342
there has been
madness down here

1535
01:55:13.425 --> 01:55:14.800
in downtown Washington. D.C.

1536
01:55:14.883 --> 01:55:16.717
The national guard
has been brought in...

1537
01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:19.467
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

1538
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:21.800
<i>By executive order.
all civilians</i>

1539
01:55:21.883 --> 01:55:25.258
<i>must immediately evacuate the
Pennsylvania Avenue corridor</i>

1540
01:55:25.342 --> 01:55:28.175
<i>between 3rd
and 12th streets northwest.</i>

1541
01:55:36.133 --> 01:55:38.550
It is the final days
of tribulation

1542
01:55:38.633 --> 01:55:40.758
that is happening to us now.

1543
01:55:40.842 --> 01:55:44.300
Can you see
what your sinfulness has done?

1544
01:55:44.383 --> 01:55:45.925
Your greed?

1545
01:55:46.008 --> 01:55:48.717
You gotta do something!
You gotta do something!

1546
01:55:49.925 --> 01:55:52.925
Come on! This way! Come on!

1547
01:55:57.633 --> 01:55:59.342
Riley!

1548
01:55:59.425 --> 01:56:00.967
All units.

1549
01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:02.008
Riley!

1550
01:56:02.092 --> 01:56:04.425
We need help.

1551
01:56:04.508 --> 01:56:07.092
- It's chaos out here.
- Riley!

1552
01:56:07.175 --> 01:56:10.842
What do you want me to do?
I don't know what to do.

1553
01:56:10.925 --> 01:56:13.175
Somebody help me.

1554
01:56:13.258 --> 01:56:15.550
I don't know what to do.

1555
01:56:19.842 --> 01:56:21.342
Diana.

1556
01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:24.133
Diana. listen to me.

1557
01:56:28.717 --> 01:56:32.133
I had a great life.

1558
01:56:33.092 --> 01:56:34.175
Steve...

1559
01:56:34.258 --> 01:56:36.883
And you only made it better.

1560
01:56:38.467 --> 01:56:41.717
But you know
what you need to do.

1561
01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:43.383
The world needs you.

1562
01:56:48.175 --> 01:56:50.342
- All right?
- No.

1563
01:56:50.425 --> 01:56:52.092
Yeah.

1564
01:57:04.925 --> 01:57:06.633
I'll never love again.

1565
01:57:06.717 --> 01:57:08.717
I pray that isn't true.

1566
01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:11.842
There's a wonderful.
big world out there.

1567
01:57:11.925 --> 01:57:15.508
This crazy new world.

1568
01:57:15.592 --> 01:57:18.800
And I am so happy
I got to see it...

1569
01:57:19.675 --> 01:57:21.883
but it deserves you.

1570
01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.842
I can't say goodbye.

1571
01:57:33.925 --> 01:57:36.758
I can't say goodbye.

1572
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:39.508
You don't have to.

1573
01:57:43.508 --> 01:57:46.175
I'm already gone.

1574
01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:02.050
I'll always love you. Diana.

1575
01:58:02.133 --> 01:58:05.008
no matter where I am.

1576
01:58:05.092 --> 01:58:06.842
I love you.

1577
01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:12.217
I renounce my wish.

1578
01:59:07.092 --> 01:59:08.508
<i>It's easy.</i>

1579
01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:13.717
<i>It's only wind and air...</i>

1580
01:59:15.175 --> 01:59:17.092
<i>and how to ride it.</i>

1581
01:59:19.133 --> 01:59:21.300
<i>How to catch it.</i>

1582
02:00:34.342 --> 02:00:35.675
You made a wish too. huh?

1583
02:00:40.050 --> 02:00:41.758
They're a bitch. aren't they?

1584
02:00:41.842 --> 02:00:45.425
Make you pay a price.
but I've never been one for rules.

1585
02:00:45.508 --> 02:00:47.675
Luckily. I have a way
to reverse it.

1586
02:00:49.092 --> 02:00:51.550
The answer is always more.

1587
02:00:51.633 --> 02:00:53.258
But you only get one wish.

1588
02:00:53.342 --> 02:00:56.133
But I. my dear.
grant the wishes.

1589
02:00:56.217 --> 02:00:59.342
So I take
what I want in return.

1590
02:00:59.425 --> 02:01:02.342
There's nothing in this world
someone doesn't have.

1591
02:01:02.425 --> 02:01:06.050
I'll rebuild my health.
wish by wish. organ by organ...

1592
02:01:06.842 --> 02:01:08.217
if I have to.

1593
02:01:09.592 --> 02:01:11.342
I'll be invincible.

1594
02:01:12.758 --> 02:01:14.342
Tell me.

1595
02:01:14.425 --> 02:01:16.467
what do you want?

1596
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:18.800
I'm feeling generous.

1597
02:01:22.008 --> 02:01:26.300
I don't want to be
like anyone anymore.

1598
02:01:28.342 --> 02:01:30.758
I want to be number one.

1599
02:01:33.425 --> 02:01:36.133
An apex predator.

1600
02:01:36.217 --> 02:01:39.717
like nothing
there's ever been before.

1601
02:01:40.925 --> 02:01:43.550
I like the way you think.

1602
02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:46.258
Go on.

1603
02:01:58.967 --> 02:02:02.717
You heard we were
coming. I presume?

1604
02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:05.800
How many broadcasting signals
can I take over at once?

1605
02:02:05.883 --> 02:02:08.133
Well. as many as you like. sir.

1606
02:02:08.217 --> 02:02:09.758
I'll take all of them.

1607
02:02:09.842 --> 02:02:11.592
All of them?

1608
02:02:11.675 --> 02:02:15.967
And I sure wish this works
for me. Don't you?

1609
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:17.925
Yes. sir.

1610
02:02:20.925 --> 02:02:23.092
Lights. camera...

1611
02:02:23.175 --> 02:02:24.800
Okay. stations 12.

1612
02:02:24.883 --> 02:02:26.925
9. 16. go transmit.

1613
02:02:27.008 --> 02:02:29.842
I need it now.
16. 9. 12. Do you receive?

1614
02:02:29.925 --> 02:02:31.217
Copy. Maximum power.

1615
02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:32.550
Okay. Moving forward now.

1616
02:02:32.633 --> 02:02:34.300
Global transmission in five.

1617
02:02:34.383 --> 02:02:36.967
four. three. two...

1618
02:02:40.758 --> 02:02:43.050
<i>Citizens of the world.</i>

1619
02:02:43.133 --> 02:02:47.592
<i>allow me to introduce myself.</i>

1620
02:02:47.675 --> 02:02:50.258
<i>I am Max Lord.</i>

1621
02:02:50.342 --> 02:02:52.925
<i>and I'm here
to change your life.</i>

1622
02:02:53.842 --> 02:02:56.550
<i>All you have to do...</i>

1623
02:02:57.592 --> 02:02:59.592
<i>is make a wish.</i>

1624
02:03:00.758 --> 02:03:03.508
<i>Anything you want.</i>

1625
02:03:03.592 --> 02:03:06.217
<i>Anything you dream of.
you can have it.</i>

1626
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:09.300
<i>If you can dream it...</i>

1627
02:03:09.383 --> 02:03:10.342
Daddy?

1628
02:03:10.425 --> 02:03:13.008
<i>...you can achieve it.</i>

1629
02:03:13.092 --> 02:03:15.967
<i>So just look into my eyes...</i>

1630
02:03:17.133 --> 02:03:19.550
<i>and make a wish.</i>

1631
02:03:19.633 --> 02:03:22.967
<i>Anything you dream of.</i>

1632
02:03:23.050 --> 02:03:24.175
<i>have it.</i>

1633
02:03:25.675 --> 02:03:28.300
<i>Right now.</i>

1634
02:03:28.383 --> 02:03:31.300
<i>Do you want to be rich?</i>

1635
02:03:31.383 --> 02:03:34.467
<i>Do you want to be powerful?</i>

1636
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:36.133
Yeah. yeah.
Whatever you say.

1637
02:03:36.217 --> 02:03:37.633
- <i>Say it out loud!</i>
- You know what I wish?

1638
02:03:37.717 --> 02:03:39.175
- What? What?
- I wish all you Irish bastards

1639
02:03:39.258 --> 02:03:41.633
would get sent back
to where you came from!

1640
02:03:41.717 --> 02:03:43.133
Yeah? Well. I wish
you'd drop dead!

1641
02:03:43.217 --> 02:03:46.258
<i>Look around you.</i>

1642
02:03:46.342 --> 02:03:48.675
<i>Make your wish!</i>

1643
02:03:48.758 --> 02:03:50.592
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

1644
02:03:50.675 --> 02:03:52.592
<i>Whatever you want.</i>

1645
02:03:52.675 --> 02:03:54.258
<i>you can have it.</i>

1646
02:03:54.342 --> 02:03:56.175
I wish for a million dollars.

1647
02:04:01.717 --> 02:04:03.342
<i>Wish for it.</i>

1648
02:04:15.925 --> 02:04:18.217
<i>Anything you want.</i>

1649
02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:22.592
<i>Anything you dream of. have it.</i>

1650
02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:24.675
<i>Yes.</i>

1651
02:04:24.758 --> 02:04:26.217
<i>I can hear it.</i>

1652
02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:29.050
<i>I hear you.</i>

1653
02:04:29.133 --> 02:04:30.217
<i>Yes. say it.</i>

1654
02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:32.050
<i>Say it out loud.</i>

1655
02:04:32.133 --> 02:04:33.925
That's right.
"I wish."

1656
02:04:35.467 --> 02:04:36.425
Take it.

1657
02:04:36.508 --> 02:04:38.800
Take it. It's all yours.

1658
02:04:38.883 --> 02:04:40.717
It's all yours for the taking!

1659
02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:48.258
And I... I take your health

1660
02:04:48.925 --> 02:04:51.133
and your strength.

1661
02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:52.800
Give her your rage

1662
02:04:52.883 --> 02:04:54.800
and your prowess.

1663
02:04:54.883 --> 02:04:57.800
And I take your power.

1664
02:04:57.883 --> 02:05:00.008
I take your life force.

1665
02:05:00.092 --> 02:05:01.925
Yes.

1666
02:05:02.008 --> 02:05:03.508
Yes!

1667
02:05:05.842 --> 02:05:07.633
That's right.

1668
02:05:07.717 --> 02:05:10.425
You're doing great.

1669
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:18.300
<i>It's all yours.</i>

1670
02:05:18.383 --> 02:05:19.842
I wish you were here. Daddy.

1671
02:05:19.925 --> 02:05:21.800
I wish you'd come back.
Daddy. please!

1672
02:05:21.883 --> 02:05:24.967
- <i>All you have to do is wish for it.</i>
- I'm still here. Daddy.

1673
02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:26.883
Daddy. please!

1674
02:06:40.425 --> 02:06:42.425
Barbara.

1675
02:06:43.175 --> 02:06:45.550
What did you do?

1676
02:08:33.050 --> 02:08:34.050
No.

1677
02:08:35.425 --> 02:08:37.633
You renounced your wish.

1678
02:08:37.717 --> 02:08:40.633
I had to. And so do you.

1679
02:08:40.717 --> 02:08:44.300
Nothing good is born
from lies. Barbara.

1680
02:08:44.383 --> 02:08:47.133
We're wasting precious time.

1681
02:08:47.217 --> 02:08:51.467
Even now. patronizing me.

1682
02:10:21.133 --> 02:10:22.883
Barbara...

1683
02:10:22.967 --> 02:10:24.758
I know you're in there. Please.

1684
02:10:24.842 --> 02:10:26.592
Please. renounce your wish.

1685
02:10:26.675 --> 02:10:28.008
It's over.

1686
02:10:28.092 --> 02:10:30.050
Please!

1687
02:10:30.133 --> 02:10:31.883
Renounce your wish.

1688
02:10:31.967 --> 02:10:33.217
Never!

1689
02:10:36.425 --> 02:10:38.342
Then I'm so sorry.

1690
02:11:21.175 --> 02:11:22.675
That's right.

1691
02:11:22.758 --> 02:11:24.467
Just wish for it.

1692
02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:26.008
It's yours now.

1693
02:11:27.217 --> 02:11:29.758
All you have to do is
say it out loud.

1694
02:11:29.842 --> 02:11:32.383
Make a wish. Any wish.

1695
02:11:32.467 --> 02:11:35.717
Look into my eyes.
and everything you've been waiting for.

1696
02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:37.383
it's all yours.

1697
02:11:37.467 --> 02:11:38.425
You're too late.

1698
02:11:40.175 --> 02:11:42.008
Granted.

1699
02:11:42.925 --> 02:11:44.383
Granted.

1700
02:11:45.175 --> 02:11:46.967
Granted.

1701
02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:49.592
Granted!

1702
02:11:49.675 --> 02:11:52.342
- Granted.
- Why are you doing this?

1703
02:11:52.425 --> 02:11:54.133
Don't you have enough?

1704
02:11:54.217 --> 02:11:56.050
Why not more?

1705
02:11:56.133 --> 02:11:57.800
Why not wish for more?

1706
02:11:57.883 --> 02:12:00.300
But they don't know
what you're taking from them.

1707
02:12:00.383 --> 02:12:02.467
We want what we want.

1708
02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:04.258
Just like you did.

1709
02:12:06.342 --> 02:12:07.842
So make a wish.

1710
02:12:07.925 --> 02:12:09.008
Very good.

1711
02:12:19.133 --> 02:12:21.175
Granted.

1712
02:12:23.133 --> 02:12:25.758
It's too late. Diana.

1713
02:12:25.842 --> 02:12:28.425
They already heard me.

1714
02:12:28.508 --> 02:12:30.883
Already wished!

1715
02:12:32.758 --> 02:12:36.842
And those that haven't yet...

1716
02:12:38.967 --> 02:12:42.092
oh. they will!

1717
02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:57.342
Granted.

1718
02:12:57.425 --> 02:12:59.467
Granted.

1719
02:13:00.508 --> 02:13:01.967
Granted.

1720
02:13:07.717 --> 02:13:10.008
Poor Diana.

1721
02:13:10.967 --> 02:13:13.300
Why be such a hero?

1722
02:13:14.508 --> 02:13:17.217
You could have kept your pilot

1723
02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:18.925
and your powers.

1724
02:13:19.008 --> 02:13:22.217
if only you'd join me.

1725
02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:25.550
Wanna reconsider?

1726
02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:29.758
I'm a forgiving man!

1727
02:13:33.717 --> 02:13:35.800
You want him back?

1728
02:13:35.883 --> 02:13:38.342
Just say the word.

1729
02:13:38.425 --> 02:13:41.008
You can have it all!

1730
02:13:41.092 --> 02:13:45.300
You just have to want it!

1731
02:13:47.342 --> 02:13:50.633
I've never wanted
anything more.

1732
02:13:56.508 --> 02:13:59.467
But he's gone...

1733
02:13:59.550 --> 02:14:02.592
and that's the truth.

1734
02:14:02.675 --> 02:14:04.967
And everything has a price.

1735
02:14:05.050 --> 02:14:07.550
One I'm not willing to pay.

1736
02:14:07.633 --> 02:14:09.217
Not anymore.

1737
02:14:15.925 --> 02:14:21.133
This world was a beautiful
place just as it was...

1738
02:14:22.217 --> 02:14:25.592
and you cannot have it all.

1739
02:14:25.675 --> 02:14:29.258
You can only have the truth.

1740
02:14:29.342 --> 02:14:32.300
And the truth is enough.

1741
02:14:32.383 --> 02:14:34.717
The truth is beautiful.

1742
02:14:37.717 --> 02:14:39.883
So look at this world...

1743
02:14:41.217 --> 02:14:45.675
and look at what your wish
is costing it.

1744
02:14:45.758 --> 02:14:49.633
You must be the hero.

1745
02:14:49.717 --> 02:14:53.258
Only you can save the day.

1746
02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:57.675
Renounce your wish

1747
02:14:57.758 --> 02:14:59.883
if you want to save this world.

1748
02:14:59.967 --> 02:15:02.342
Why would I...

1749
02:15:02.425 --> 02:15:06.175
when it's finally my turn?

1750
02:15:07.675 --> 02:15:11.217
The world belongs to me!

1751
02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:15.300
You can't stop me. No one can!

1752
02:15:16.675 --> 02:15:18.758
I wasn't talking to you.

1753
02:15:26.425 --> 02:15:29.883
I was talking to everyone else.

1754
02:15:34.050 --> 02:15:37.342
<i>Because you're not the only one
who has suffered.</i>

1755
02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:40.175
<i>Who wants more.</i>

1756
02:15:44.133 --> 02:15:47.300
<i>Who wants them back.</i>

1757
02:15:48.967 --> 02:15:52.092
<i>Who doesn't want
to be afraid anymore.</i>

1758
02:15:55.550 --> 02:15:57.550
<i>Or alone.</i>

1759
02:15:57.633 --> 02:15:59.050
<i>Stop!</i>

1760
02:15:59.133 --> 02:16:01.425
Cut the signal! Stop!

1761
02:16:01.508 --> 02:16:03.550
Or frightened.

1762
02:16:03.633 --> 02:16:06.217
Or powerless.

1763
02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:09.967
'Cause you're not the only one
who imagined a world

1764
02:16:10.050 --> 02:16:13.383
where everything was different.

1765
02:16:17.883 --> 02:16:19.175
<i>Better.</i>

1766
02:16:19.258 --> 02:16:21.842
<i>Finally.</i>

1767
02:16:25.175 --> 02:16:29.425
<i>A world where they were loved</i>

1768
02:16:29.508 --> 02:16:32.758
<i>and seen. and appreciated.</i>

1769
02:16:33.383 --> 02:16:34.342
Finally.

1770
02:16:34.425 --> 02:16:36.425
<i>Oh. my God. Who is he?</i>

1771
02:16:36.508 --> 02:16:38.758
He doesn't even speak English.

1772
02:16:38.842 --> 02:16:40.592
What is he eating?

1773
02:16:40.675 --> 02:16:41.758
Look at his shoes!

1774
02:16:43.133 --> 02:16:44.175
Weirdo!

1775
02:17:03.758 --> 02:17:07.633
<i>But what is it costing you?</i>

1776
02:17:07.717 --> 02:17:10.217
Do you see the truth?

1777
02:17:22.342 --> 02:17:23.342
<i>Daddy!</i>

1778
02:17:25.050 --> 02:17:26.967
<i>Daddy!</i>

1779
02:17:36.925 --> 02:17:40.717
The Russians are launching.
We've got orders to counter.

1780
02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:42.633
All right. all right.

1781
02:18:00.217 --> 02:18:02.133
Alistair!

1782
02:18:03.425 --> 02:18:04.883
<i>Emergency alert.</i>

1783
02:18:04.967 --> 02:18:07.217
<i>You have four minutes

Alistair!

1785
02:18:14.425 --> 02:18:16.592
My son!

1786

<i>Stay calm

1787

<i>Daddy! Daddy!</i>

1789
02:18:24.425 --> 02:18:25.467
Help me. Daddy!

1790
02:18:25.550 --> 02:18:27.175
<i>This is not a test.</i>

1791
02:18:27.258 --> 02:18:28.342
Daddy!

1792
02:18:30.967 --> 02:18:32.383
<i>Daddy!</i>

1793
02:18:32.467 --> 02:18:34.258
<i>One-minute warning.</i>

1794
02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:37.258
Wait. My son!

1795
02:18:37.342 --> 02:18:39.175
I can see my son!

1796
02:18:39.258 --> 02:18:41.092
Save him. Max.

1797
02:18:42.633 --> 02:18:44.300
I have to save my son.

1798
02:18:44.383 --> 02:18:45.967
<i>Daddy!</i>

1799
02:18:46.050 --> 02:18:47.217
Alistair.

1800
02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:49.550
Daddy!

1801
02:18:49.633 --> 02:18:50.717
Daddy!

1802
02:18:51.383 --> 02:18:54.175
My... Alistair.

1803
02:18:55.467 --> 02:18:57.842
I renounce my wish!

1804
02:19:12.508 --> 02:19:14.217
I renounce my wish.

1805
02:19:17.508 --> 02:19:20.133
We have missiles
disappearing. sir.

1806
02:19:21.133 --> 02:19:22.383
Yes. sir.

1807
02:19:22.467 --> 02:19:24.717
<i>They are vanishing
from our screen.</i>

1808
02:19:28.175 --> 02:19:30.592
<i>Only just hearing
now that a ceasefire</i>

1809

<i>between the Soviet Union
and the United States</i>

1810
02:19:33.133 --> 02:19:35.758
<i>has averted
a global nuclear crisis.</i>

1811
02:19:37.592 --> 02:19:39.425
I renounce my wish.

1812
02:19:57.592 --> 02:19:58.967
- I take back my wish.
- I renounce my wish.

1813
02:20:21.258 --> 02:20:23.550
Alistair!

1814
02:20:30.092 --> 02:20:32.008
Alistair!

1815
02:20:32.425 --> 02:20:35.050
Alistair!

1816
02:20:37.508 --> 02:20:38.508
Daddy!

1817
02:20:45.008 --> 02:20:46.925
- Daddy!
- Alistair!

1818
02:20:51.050 --> 02:20:52.800
Alistair.

1819
02:20:55.967 --> 02:20:58.008
Oh. Alistair. Alistair.

1820
02:20:58.092 --> 02:21:00.508
I'm so sorry. baby.

1821
02:21:02.425 --> 02:21:06.633
I'm so glad I wished you'd come.
I knew it would work.

1822
02:21:09.592 --> 02:21:10.675
No.

1823
02:21:11.758 --> 02:21:13.800
That is not why I'm back.

1824
02:21:14.467 --> 02:21:15.550
No.

1825
02:21:17.425 --> 02:21:19.633
I've been lying to you.

1826
02:21:21.050 --> 02:21:24.175
I'm not a great guy.

1827
02:21:24.258 --> 02:21:27.092
In fact. I'm a pretty
messed up. loser guy.

1828
02:21:29.092 --> 02:21:31.883
And I made terrible mistakes.

1829
02:21:32.717 --> 02:21:34.467
But you...

1830
02:21:36.342 --> 02:21:40.133
you don't ever have to make
a wish for me to love you.

1831
02:21:41.592 --> 02:21:44.133
I'm here because I love you.

1832
02:21:46.467 --> 02:21:48.425
I just...

1833
02:21:48.508 --> 02:21:50.675
I just wish and I pray that.
one day.

1834
02:21:50.758 --> 02:21:52.342
I'll be able to
make you proud enough

1835
02:21:52.425 --> 02:21:55.133
that you'll be
able to forgive me.

1836
02:21:56.592 --> 02:21:58.425
And love me.

1837
02:21:58.508 --> 02:22:01.467
Because I'm nothing
to be proud of. Alistair.

1838
02:22:01.550 --> 02:22:04.592
I don't need you
to make me proud.

1839
02:22:04.675 --> 02:22:07.133
I already love you. Daddy.

1840
02:22:07.217 --> 02:22:09.425
You're my dad.

1841
02:22:56.383 --> 02:22:59.133
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Sorry.

1842
02:22:59.217 --> 02:23:01.675
It's okay. It's okay.

1843
02:23:06.717 --> 02:23:08.967
So beautiful.

1844
02:23:14.050 --> 02:23:18.633
Sorry.
Just talking to myself.

1845
02:23:20.883 --> 02:23:22.758
It's all right.

1846
02:23:22.842 --> 02:23:24.550
It's just that...

1847
02:23:24.633 --> 02:23:29.633
It's wonderful.
It's so many things.

1848
02:23:30.592 --> 02:23:32.133
Yeah.

1849
02:23:33.133 --> 02:23:35.175
I know what you mean.

1850
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:42.508
I like your...

1851
02:23:42.592 --> 02:23:43.800
I like your outfit.

1852
02:23:44.342 --> 02:23:46.008
You like...

1853
02:23:46.092 --> 02:23:47.092
Thanks.

1854
02:23:47.175 --> 02:23:49.050
You know. my friends...

1855
02:23:49.133 --> 02:23:52.508
they kinda tease me about it.
but it works. right?

1856
02:23:52.592 --> 02:23:54.467
- You look great.
- Thank you.

1857
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:57.008
You just made my day.

1858
02:24:04.717 --> 02:24:07.717
- Happy holidays. See you around.
- Happy holidays.

1859
02:24:47.675 --> 02:24:50.883
So many things.

1860
02:24:53.258 --> 02:24:56.925
So. so many things.

1861
02:26:32.925 --> 02:26:34.842
- Whoa!
- Look out!

1862
02:26:37.592 --> 02:26:39.092
Oh. my God.

1863
02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:42.717
- Mom. would you take her?
- Yeah.

1864
02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:44.383
Um. excuse me.

1865
02:26:44.467 --> 02:26:47.633
Excuse me. Please.
you have to let me thank you. Miss...

1866
02:26:48.967 --> 02:26:50.092
Asteria.

1867
02:26:50.175 --> 02:26:52.925
Asteria. Wow.
That's a beautiful name.

1868
02:26:53.008 --> 02:26:54.467
It's from my culture.

1869
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:56.925
I can't thank you enough.
I mean. you saved my daughter.

1870
02:26:57.008 --> 02:26:58.758
How did you do that?

1871
02:26:58.842 --> 02:27:02.842
It's just a simple shift of weight.
Takes practice.

1872
02:27:02.925 --> 02:27:06.342
But I've been
doing this a long time.

1873
