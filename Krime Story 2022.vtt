00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:33.166
Could I ask you for a cig--

4
00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:35.791
cigarette?

5
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.791
God bless you with kids.

7
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.500
God bless you once more.

8
00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:45.916
Good luck. man.

9
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:53.666
<i>Someone found a corpse of a young woman.</i>

10
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.875
<i>Can you go to the crime scene?</i>

11
00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.916
We're very busy.

12
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:00.750
Just kidding.

13
00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:01.666
<i>Bye.</i>

14
00:01:03.583 --> 00:01:04.916
What are you doing?

15
00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:07.500
Siren.

16
00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:11.666
Freeze! Police!

17
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.208
Catch him!

18
00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:23.250
Freeze or I'll shoot!

19
00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:35.291
Freeze!

20
00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:42.750
Freeze!

21
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:11.208
I'll shoot. Drop it.

22
00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:15.666
It's just a purse.

23
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:19.875
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY.

24
00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:28.416
Freeze!

25
00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:44.625
Puke and turn back slowly

26
00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:46.291
so I can see your hands.

27
00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:49.833
Yes. sir.

28
00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:51.166
Drop the bag.

29
00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:56.583
Freeze! Police!

30
00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.583
God help me. Surrounded by idiots!

31
00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:26.416
Here's my ugly bro.

32
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:30.500
Are you crazy?

33
00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:33.250
Get dressed. and we're out.

34
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:35.500
We're out? Are you crazy?

35
00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:39.833
-Where do you wanna go?
-To Kosmaty. To the club.

36
00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:41.250
I'm not going anywhere.

37
00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:46.125
Stop whining and put your kicks on.

38
00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:48.208
-We gotta celebrate.
-Yeah?

39
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.625
What?

40
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:57.375
Look at the polo shirt I bought!

41
00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:00.458
Check it out.

42
00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:04.500
Nice. bro.

43
00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:10.291
Matches your sweet six-pack.

44
00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:14.000
Admire your prince!

45
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.708
What the fuck. Picasso?
You're not gonna share?

46
00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:32.625
Here.

47
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.291
What is this shit?

48
00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:46.708
-Fluorescent tube dust?
-What?

49
00:05:57.791 --> 00:05:58.916
Kamila!

50
00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:01.750
Wake up!

51
00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:04.583
Mommy…

52
00:06:04.666 --> 00:06:08.416
Stop crying and sort yourself out

53
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.458
or you'll fail your finals
and end up like…

54
00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:32.541
Here's my daughter.

55
00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:35.333
-Morning. daddy.
-You look lovely.

56
00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:36.291
Thank you.

57
00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:41.708
Is your exam today?

58
00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:45.416
Daddy?

59
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:49.625
Did you ask at the club?

60
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.333
Yeah. I mean. what club?

61
00:06:52.916 --> 00:06:54.041
I'll wait in the car.

62
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.916
You're messing with me.

63
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.166
It's my 18th birthday.

64
00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:05.291
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

65
00:07:06.416 --> 00:07:07.250
And?

66
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.625
I talked to the manager yesterday.
Everything is taken care of.

67
00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:19.541
What about the car?

68
00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:23.291
A little car for the little one.

69
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.500
-Okay.
-You're going?

70
00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:30.708
I have to.

71
00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:35.208
I'd love a red one.

72
00:07:35.708 --> 00:07:37.500
It's my dream.

73
00:07:41.083 --> 00:07:42.250
I love you.

74
00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.083
Did you study?

75
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:54.000
Patryk?

76
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.625
A friend from work.

77
00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:58.500
But you're not working.

78
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:01.791
-Daddy would be--
-Mind your words.

79
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.708
Did you really forget?

80
00:08:39.833 --> 00:08:41.250
Are we besties?

81
00:08:47.375 --> 00:08:49.791
-Today is Klaudia's deathday.
-Stop it.

82
00:09:12.166 --> 00:09:13.875
What's so funny. sluts?

83
00:09:14.875 --> 00:09:17.833
Stop talking and relax a bit.

84
00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:24.625
Stick that finger up your Mariana Trench.

85
00:09:24.708 --> 00:09:25.750
Out.

86
00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:29.708
We'd better go. It stinks in here.

87
00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:37.458
They totally tick me off.

88
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.958
What trench?

89
00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:43.791
What's new with you?

90
00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:44.958
Look what I've got.

91
00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:51.583
-Where did you get that?
-From my brother.

92
00:09:51.666 --> 00:09:53.083
It has a nice kick.

93
00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:55.750
-Who's first?
-Let's do it.

94
00:09:57.208 --> 00:09:58.250
Wait.

95
00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:01.375
Let's go.

96
00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:04.291
-Fuck.
-Time to do some shopping.

97
00:10:14.916 --> 00:10:18.166
What the fuck happened last night?
I'm all fucking sore!

98
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.500
I hardly remember.

99
00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:27.125
You were at the bar with the hussy
and picked up a fight with three guys.

100
00:10:27.208 --> 00:10:29.333
-We're going.
-I'm talking.

101
00:10:29.416 --> 00:10:31.541
-Get lost.
-I'll smash your face. bitch.

102
00:10:31.625 --> 00:10:33.291
And you. shut the fuck up.

103
00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:36.833
-Come on!
-And who are you? My guardian?

104
00:10:36.916 --> 00:10:40.125
-Let's fuck him up.
-Fuck you. I can handle it myself.

105
00:10:42.416 --> 00:10:45.041
-With who?
-With who…

106
00:10:46.708 --> 00:10:48.625
Kruszor. Miki. Pieszczoch.

107
00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:52.500
Are you insane?
They rule half of the city.

108
00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:02.583
-Fuck them.
-They'll fuck you.

109
00:11:16.833 --> 00:11:19.708
Do you remember Marta. the nurse?

110
00:11:20.291 --> 00:11:22.500
How could I not?

111
00:11:28.166 --> 00:11:30.333
I promised to go with her
for an ultrasound.

112
00:11:31.833 --> 00:11:33.250
-Really?
-Yeah.

113
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.375
What are you gonna do?

114
00:11:38.375 --> 00:11:39.750
Raise a little thief?

115
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.375
Fuck you. Krime!
At least he won't steal from the poor.

116
00:11:44.458 --> 00:11:46.916
-Relax.
-Where's my polo?

117
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.041
You're wearing it.

118
00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.125
Take it.

119
00:11:51.916 --> 00:11:53.166
Show your booby.

120
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.375
Do it! That would be nice.

121
00:12:03.166 --> 00:12:04.375
Hi there.

122
00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:08.458
Long time. no see. You look stunning.

123
00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:11.666
Guys say hi.

124
00:12:12.208 --> 00:12:13.916
It was fun. Pity you went home.

125
00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:17.000
Are you gonna introduce me?

126
00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:19.250
-Exactly?
-Exactly.

127
00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:21.166
My besties: Kobra and Kama.

128
00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:23.958
-Besties…
-Kobra.

129
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:24.875
Tomek.

130
00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:28.958
Hi.

131
00:12:32.416 --> 00:12:33.541
Nice nails.

132
00:12:36.208 --> 00:12:37.791
What's wrong with you?

133
00:12:38.833 --> 00:12:40.000
You look bored.

134
00:12:41.791 --> 00:12:44.583
How about some snow?

135
00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:48.583
-And only now you're asking?
-Come to my place.

136
00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:00.625
Okay.

137
00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:04.791
-I've done it before.
-Don't be afraid.

138
00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:05.875
Under the tongue.

139
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.625
-Very good.
-What's that acid?

140
00:13:10.375 --> 00:13:14.000
Four chicks on a bike.

141
00:13:14.083 --> 00:13:15.666
I thought you take it…

142
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.750
Like this?

143
00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:26.625
You've got three babes
and I'm not going anywhere.

144
00:13:27.166 --> 00:13:28.416
Cause I'm driving.

145
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.291
These papers

146
00:13:34.583 --> 00:13:37.750
are part of a bigger picture that depicts

147
00:13:39.041 --> 00:13:40.166
a woman on a bike.

148
00:13:42.916 --> 00:13:45.666
Some say that it's

149
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.875
Albert Hofmann himself
testing his invention.

150
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.625
What a story. Chicks on bikes rule.

151
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:01.166
Do you see that?

152
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.791
Don't go tripping. It'll kick in an hour.

153
00:14:08.916 --> 00:14:12.166
-You're up for dancing and stuff…
-I got stung by a bee!

154
00:14:13.208 --> 00:14:15.208
Listen. I got stung by a bee!

155
00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:17.333
Kobra. what bee?

156
00:14:19.083 --> 00:14:23.125
-I have a hole. right here.
-There's a hole. look. A tiny hole.

157
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.000
Why are there so many?

158
00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:49.750
-We'll fix it.
-Fuck! I've lost my fucking hand!

159
00:14:49.833 --> 00:14:51.666
Come with me. I'll fix it.

160
00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:08.333
Kobra?

161
00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:20.625
-Please. help me.
-That's what I'm doing.

162
00:15:20.708 --> 00:15:23.458
-Kobra?
-Something bit me.

163
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:25.000
I'm helping you.

164
00:15:26.875 --> 00:15:27.750
Kobra?

165
00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:32.833
Fuck! I've lost my hand.

166
00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:34.875
It's okay.

167
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.458
My hand is gone.

168
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:39.208
Motherfucker!

169
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.916
Help me. please.

170
00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:51.875
Did you see this hole?

171
00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.208
Fucking hell. A bee stung me.

172
00:15:55.083 --> 00:15:58.916
-No.
-Did you see that? Can you hear me?

173
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.333
-Fuck!
-Kamila?

174
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.625
We saw the fucker

175
00:16:36.708 --> 00:16:39.208
and he's acting like there's no problem.

176
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:42.500
We put him on the ground
and bit the shit out of him.

177
00:16:42.583 --> 00:16:43.500
Mrówa?

178
00:16:44.458 --> 00:16:47.083
-What the fuck? Leave him!
-Get out of here.

179
00:16:47.166 --> 00:16:49.333
-Scram!
-Come on.

180
00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:51.375
You mix glass with coke?

181
00:16:51.458 --> 00:16:53.000
Krime. I'd never do that.

182
00:16:53.083 --> 00:16:54.291
Mrówa…

183
00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:59.916
You're so smart. huh?

184
00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:02.916
Man. leave me be!

185
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.750
Where is the stuff?

186
00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:13.083
In my apartment.
I'll give you everything. just let go.

187
00:17:15.541 --> 00:17:18.708
-You broke my watch.
-What's going on?

188
00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:23.333
My friend had an accident.
but I'm helping him.

189
00:17:23.416 --> 00:17:25.041
-An accident?
-Yeah.

190
00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:27.916
I won't leave it like that. Darek?

191
00:17:31.208 --> 00:17:32.291
People!

192
00:17:40.666 --> 00:17:42.541
Do you have a permit for this shit?

193
00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:47.125
Are you Mexican?

194
00:17:49.625 --> 00:17:52.083
Are you gonna play games or talk to me?

195
00:17:52.916 --> 00:17:53.750
<i>Señorita?</i>

196
00:17:53.833 --> 00:17:55.125
You're a naughty boy.

197
00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.625
<i>Four-eleven. over?</i>

198
00:17:59.208 --> 00:18:00.625
It's 411. over.

199
00:18:00.708 --> 00:18:04.916
<i>We have a mugging on Chopin Street.</i>
<i>Slim man. 30-35 years old.</i>

200
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.708
<i>Six feet tall.</i>

201
00:18:06.791 --> 00:18:10.250
<i>Possibly an albino.</i>
<i>Black trousers and black hoodie.</i>

202
00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:12.000
Copy that.

203
00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:15.000
It might be your guy.

204
00:19:00.291 --> 00:19:01.958
Just don't make a mess. boy.

205
00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:09.916
It might get ugly in here.

206
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.000
You've finally arrived!

207
00:19:13.083 --> 00:19:15.083
That fucker beat up our Dareczek.

208
00:19:15.166 --> 00:19:17.208
Blood was everywhere.

209
00:19:17.291 --> 00:19:18.166
This guy?

210
00:19:23.083 --> 00:19:24.041
Looks like him.

211
00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.916
-It's him.
-Are you sure?

212
00:19:29.541 --> 00:19:31.791
Do I look like an idiot from TV?

213
00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:34.291
-He went that way.
-Stay here.

214
00:19:35.083 --> 00:19:36.083
I need a run.

215
00:19:37.416 --> 00:19:39.916
And something else. Where does he live?

216
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.750
Over there. Third floor. On the left.

217
00:19:44.291 --> 00:19:46.375
I'm asking for the last time. Open.

218
00:19:47.208 --> 00:19:48.041
Wait.

219
00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:50.166
But you promise?

220
00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:54.083
Open the door. Mrówa.

221
00:19:54.166 --> 00:19:55.250
Do you promise?

222
00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.416
I promise.

223
00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:00.875
Okay.

224
00:20:11.416 --> 00:20:14.291
How do you welcome friends?
You look like shit.

225
00:20:15.791 --> 00:20:17.583
A car hit me on Chopin Street.

226
00:20:18.166 --> 00:20:20.583
Classical music can kill you.

227
00:20:21.416 --> 00:20:24.208
-What did Chudy want?
-You'll find nothing.

228
00:20:30.666 --> 00:20:32.625
You're a party man. aren't you?

229
00:20:33.416 --> 00:20:36.583
-That's not mine.
-I wouldn't admit to that either.

230
00:20:38.083 --> 00:20:40.416
Mrówa…

231
00:20:41.625 --> 00:20:44.791
This can send you
to a nice prison retreat.

232
00:20:46.833 --> 00:20:48.083
Let's talk.

233
00:20:49.375 --> 00:20:50.500
Come on.

234
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.833
Come on.

235
00:21:07.791 --> 00:21:09.666
Who is he and what did he want?

236
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.500
I don't know.

237
00:21:15.416 --> 00:21:16.541
Sit.

238
00:21:20.083 --> 00:21:21.916
Who is he and what did he want?

239
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.458
-You couldn't call?
-I prefer knocking.

240
00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:39.416
Someone gotta clean up this mess.

241
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.958
For fuck's sake.

242
00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:01.125
Maybe I'll come back later?

243
00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:08.208
Wanna join. Wajcha?

244
00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:15.791
What's up?

245
00:22:19.458 --> 00:22:20.375
Listen. doll.

246
00:22:21.166 --> 00:22:24.500
You did well yesterday.
but I need to talk to my bro.

247
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.375
You help us. we help you.

248
00:22:29.458 --> 00:22:31.541
So. will you help us?

249
00:22:33.541 --> 00:22:35.541
I will. but I still need to clean.

250
00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:47.333
Later.

251
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.250
Careful with that.

252
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:58.208
-Someone is waiting for us.
-Who?

253
00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:02.416
Don't you worry. We'll be rich soon.

254
00:23:04.708 --> 00:23:06.333
Forget this shithole.

255
00:23:06.416 --> 00:23:09.541
We'll be rich like fucking banksters.

256
00:23:09.625 --> 00:23:10.708
Heard that before.

257
00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:14.333
Get inside. sir.

258
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.958
-Am I also invited?
-Yeah. but be good.

259
00:23:25.041 --> 00:23:26.500
Phones off.

260
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.750
Move your ass.

261
00:23:34.166 --> 00:23:36.458
-If we pull it off--
-Who was that?

262
00:23:36.541 --> 00:23:38.166
You know who Papier is?

263
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.916
He has a currency exchange shop downtown.
He organized that.

264
00:23:42.583 --> 00:23:45.625
They belong to the mob. They'll kill us.

265
00:23:45.708 --> 00:23:49.375
What fucking mob? Have you seen that guy?

266
00:23:49.458 --> 00:23:51.625
He acted like a circus monkey.

267
00:23:53.208 --> 00:23:54.500
I have a bad feeling.

268
00:23:54.583 --> 00:23:59.708
The guy who recommended you said
you can be trusted and you know your shit.

269
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.125
This gig can change
your financial situation.

270
00:24:04.208 --> 00:24:05.041
Forever.

271
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.500
You'll become respected citizens.

272
00:24:09.541 --> 00:24:10.375
Just like us.

273
00:24:10.875 --> 00:24:15.375
We've got the chance
to change our miserable fate.

274
00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:20.458
-Aren't you tired of this life?
-I am.

275
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:22.083
You'll pay off your debts.

276
00:24:23.208 --> 00:24:26.458
And when my son is born.
I'll be able to look him in the eye.

277
00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:28.416
Just don't start crying. okay?

278
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.291
I'll open my business and be legit.

279
00:24:32.375 --> 00:24:35.375
But you got to steal the first million.

280
00:24:35.458 --> 00:24:37.458
Good one. Balzac?

281
00:24:38.708 --> 00:24:39.750
What?

282
00:24:39.833 --> 00:24:42.291
-Trust me. bro.
-How am I--

283
00:24:42.375 --> 00:24:45.958
-Let's fuck this system!
-How am I… This is nonsense.

284
00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:47.291
Fuck poverty!

285
00:24:50.333 --> 00:24:51.166
Nice.

286
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:58.125
A businessman playing politics
will give another one a huge bribe.

287
00:24:58.208 --> 00:25:02.208
There'll be around five million
in his briefcase.

288
00:25:03.541 --> 00:25:05.583
It'll be chained to his wrist.

289
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.583
You'll drive away in the stolen car
that we'll provide you.

290
00:25:11.291 --> 00:25:13.541
We'll split the money into five parts.

291
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:15.083
Any questions?

292
00:25:16.083 --> 00:25:16.916
Five parts?

293
00:25:18.541 --> 00:25:21.583
-And there will be no security?
-You've got my word.

294
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.458
-Five million?
-Do you have guns?

295
00:25:24.541 --> 00:25:25.375
Sure.

296
00:25:26.333 --> 00:25:27.750
Brilliant.

297
00:25:27.833 --> 00:25:31.375
They're old. not used in a long time.

298
00:25:31.458 --> 00:25:32.291
Take this one.

299
00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:35.708
Can you handle it?

300
00:25:35.791 --> 00:25:38.208
-Sure thing.
-What's your decision?

301
00:25:39.458 --> 00:25:42.208
We're gonna fucking kill it!

302
00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:44.541
Heard that?

303
00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:49.750
On one condition.

304
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:52.000
Without snow.

305
00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:53.708
No snow.

306
00:25:53.791 --> 00:25:55.458
But promise me one thing.

307
00:25:56.125 --> 00:25:59.000
If something happens.
you'll take care of my son.

308
00:25:59.708 --> 00:26:03.208
-I want the <i>Godfather</i> theme at my funeral.
-Stop this bullshit.

309
00:26:03.708 --> 00:26:06.833
-It's just a joke.
-I can poke you back.

310
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.625
No snow.

311
00:26:09.708 --> 00:26:11.500
<i>A white teddy bear</i>

312
00:26:11.583 --> 00:26:13.875
<i>For the girl</i>

313
00:26:14.791 --> 00:26:18.166
<i>Whom I love now and always</i>

314
00:27:05.666 --> 00:27:08.708
TRONIX PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

315
00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:28.208
Let's go!

316
00:27:44.875 --> 00:27:47.125
But he did wear a condom. didn't he?

317
00:27:47.208 --> 00:27:49.750
For fuck's sake. What got into your head?

318
00:27:49.833 --> 00:27:53.041
Nothing happened. thanks to you.

319
00:27:53.125 --> 00:27:55.375
Thanks to me?

320
00:27:55.458 --> 00:27:56.958
Fuck you.

321
00:27:57.041 --> 00:27:58.416
Fuck…

322
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.875
-What the hell happened there?
-Stop.

323
00:28:01.958 --> 00:28:02.875
Your jacket.

324
00:28:04.833 --> 00:28:05.916
Look at me.

325
00:28:09.916 --> 00:28:12.708
The doctor had a few yesterday.

326
00:28:13.916 --> 00:28:16.958
-But I can see how bad you look.
-And?

327
00:28:18.083 --> 00:28:19.083
And…

328
00:28:20.958 --> 00:28:24.458
Every Friday. we hold meetings here.

329
00:28:25.583 --> 00:28:27.583
They helped me back in a day.

330
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.458
It's kind of therapy.

331
00:28:32.291 --> 00:28:35.083
-You got it wrong.
-Think about it.

332
00:28:35.166 --> 00:28:36.666
Sure.

333
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.416
-And?
-It's broken.

334
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.750
-What?!
-I won't be taking the finals.

335
00:28:42.833 --> 00:28:43.791
No way!

336
00:28:44.375 --> 00:28:46.375
Ouch. you idiot!

337
00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:49.708
-Stinks like death.
-Catch.

338
00:28:49.791 --> 00:28:52.125
Excuse me.

339
00:28:52.208 --> 00:28:55.250
Is this your phone?
You left it in the office.

340
00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:57.291
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

341
00:28:58.666 --> 00:29:00.083
Take this bag off me.

342
00:29:09.166 --> 00:29:12.000
Holy fuck! What a ride!

343
00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:14.125
They picked us up with this one.

344
00:29:14.208 --> 00:29:16.208
You said you liked it.

345
00:29:17.416 --> 00:29:19.750
Did you think they'd steal another one?

346
00:29:23.833 --> 00:29:27.625
Well. V8 engine. 300 horsepower.

347
00:29:27.708 --> 00:29:31.666
That's what I fucking need.

348
00:29:44.375 --> 00:29:46.125
It must be 20 years old.

349
00:29:46.625 --> 00:29:47.500
So fucking what?

350
00:29:48.666 --> 00:29:50.166
At worst. we won't get there.

351
00:29:57.333 --> 00:29:59.416
We agreed on something.

352
00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:03.916
A small line never killed anybody.

353
00:30:13.125 --> 00:30:14.291
Drive.

354
00:30:31.375 --> 00:30:32.750
Chill. bro.

355
00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:36.625
We want to steal something
using a stolen car.

356
00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:40.041
-Don't shit yourself.
-Don't touch me.

357
00:30:42.291 --> 00:30:45.208
You're a dickhead.
Focus on the road. Wajcha.

358
00:30:45.791 --> 00:30:47.125
On the toad?

359
00:30:48.541 --> 00:30:49.916
Yeah.

360
00:30:50.958 --> 00:30:52.333
Just chill. dude.

361
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.916
What got you so paranoid? Drugs?

362
00:30:57.916 --> 00:31:02.208
I'm already planning
how I'm gonna spend my money.

363
00:31:02.291 --> 00:31:05.958
-Why are you laughing?
-What you gonna get?

364
00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:10.625
I'll get a sweet fucking bling chain.
thicker than this one.

365
00:31:11.125 --> 00:31:14.875
Made of platinum. not some fucking tombac.

366
00:31:15.875 --> 00:31:17.916
-A nice ride.
-What kind?

367
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.708
Simple. A prince needs a Merc.

368
00:31:22.791 --> 00:31:24.958
-I'd get a jeep.
-Me. Merc.

369
00:31:25.041 --> 00:31:27.875
A jeep would suit you. Get a Škoda.

370
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.083
I'll buy a house for the hussy.

371
00:31:32.583 --> 00:31:34.583
You'll buy a house and then what?

372
00:31:34.666 --> 00:31:36.958
I'll marry her and get her pregnant.

373
00:31:37.041 --> 00:31:41.000
No fucking way.
With the hussy? Are you insane?

374
00:31:41.083 --> 00:31:41.916
She's great.

375
00:31:42.708 --> 00:31:45.166
You're gonna end up six feet under.

376
00:31:46.375 --> 00:31:49.791
How can you marry the hussy?
Just think about it.

377
00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:04.333
-Krime!
-Wajcha!

378
00:32:10.916 --> 00:32:12.750
On the ground. you fuckers!

379
00:32:13.416 --> 00:32:15.666
-What's going on?
-You heard me!

380
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.000
Get the fuck on the ground! Stay still!

381
00:32:24.875 --> 00:32:26.166
Stay down.

382
00:32:28.875 --> 00:32:30.000
-Don't shoot!
-Down!

383
00:32:30.083 --> 00:32:32.125
-Don't shoot! Take the cash!
-Stay!

384
00:32:32.208 --> 00:32:33.958
-Don't shoot.
-Relax.

385
00:32:34.041 --> 00:32:36.291
I'm calling the police!

386
00:32:37.125 --> 00:32:40.708
You wanna live?
Shut up and get on the ground.

387
00:32:43.958 --> 00:32:46.916
-No!
-Come on.

388
00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:53.291
Over here. you idiot.

389
00:32:59.083 --> 00:33:01.541
Don't do anything.

390
00:33:09.416 --> 00:33:10.541
We're leaving.

391
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.083
-It's over.
-"Don't shoot"? Five million!

392
00:33:25.166 --> 00:33:29.708
-No. don't--
-You acted like a student!

393
00:33:36.916 --> 00:33:39.916
-Wrong way. turn right.
-It was one way.

394
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.500
It was a shortcut. You know what that is?

395
00:33:42.583 --> 00:33:44.666
-Don't shit yourself.
-Turn right.

396
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.666
We're fucked because you had to get high
and act like an owl.

397
00:33:52.875 --> 00:33:54.291
That's great. Well done.

398
00:33:57.458 --> 00:33:59.000
I can't believe it!

399
00:33:59.583 --> 00:34:03.583
You look like an ancestor
of owl and toucan.

400
00:34:03.666 --> 00:34:05.583
You're a fucking toucanowl.

401
00:34:07.708 --> 00:34:09.666
We did it. man!

402
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.541
Bang-bang! On the ground. bitches!

403
00:34:13.833 --> 00:34:16.250
Did you have be rough with the waitress?

404
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.500
Why are you laughing?

405
00:34:19.583 --> 00:34:23.375
We're the Knights of the Round Table
and you told her to shut up.

406
00:34:23.458 --> 00:34:25.583
-What was I supposed to say?
-What to say--

407
00:34:25.666 --> 00:34:29.916
-"Could you please shut up?"
-We're the Knights of the Round Table.

408
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.833
Who?

409
00:34:30.916 --> 00:34:33.458
Knights of the Round Table.
Didn't you know?

410
00:34:33.958 --> 00:34:36.750
You acted like a redneck.
Knights don't say that--

411
00:34:36.833 --> 00:34:40.666
What do the knights say?
"My Lady. please lie on the ground"?

412
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:46.208
-You should have said that.
-Tell me what was I supposed to say.

413
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:49.708
"Excuse me ma'am.
please lie on the ground."

414
00:34:49.791 --> 00:34:51.875
Exactly.

415
00:34:51.958 --> 00:34:54.291
-You know how that sounds?
-How?

416
00:34:54.375 --> 00:34:56.791
-Very gangsta.
-My intention.

417
00:34:56.875 --> 00:34:59.166
Gangsta Knight of the Round Table.

418
00:34:59.916 --> 00:35:03.333
You acted like a peasant with a pitchfork.

419
00:35:04.125 --> 00:35:07.541
-I'm Lancelot. get that?
-Yeah. right.

420
00:35:07.625 --> 00:35:10.500
-Lancelot.
-Would Lancelot speak like that?

421
00:35:10.583 --> 00:35:14.750
-He always spoke like that.
-Like what? "Shut it"?

422
00:35:14.833 --> 00:35:17.416
-I said "shut up."
-He'd add. "princess."

423
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.708
The lady-killer lives here.

424
00:35:22.708 --> 00:35:23.791
So?

425
00:35:25.416 --> 00:35:28.208
-It doesn't interest you?
-It's not our case.

426
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.583
Unfortunately.

427
00:35:30.666 --> 00:35:33.500
-You'd rather chase losers?
-Someone has to.

428
00:35:36.833 --> 00:35:40.166
-I know him. It's Chada!
-Cops!

429
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:41.625
Go!

430
00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:45.083
Faster!

431
00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:47.166
Holy shit! Go.

432
00:35:54.583 --> 00:35:56.125
Relax.

433
00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.958
A green jaguar--

434
00:35:59.041 --> 00:36:01.166
Can't you see it's brown?

435
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.083
Not gray?

436
00:36:02.958 --> 00:36:04.291
Khaki. I don't know.

437
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.750
An olive Jaguar.

438
00:36:06.833 --> 00:36:08.833
We've got him. kiddo.

439
00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:11.791
Another cop car.

440
00:36:14.125 --> 00:36:16.916
Plan B. Wajcha. Speed up!

441
00:36:22.625 --> 00:36:24.208
Get him!

442
00:36:32.625 --> 00:36:35.958
Block the exit to Gdańsk on the bypass.

443
00:36:38.833 --> 00:36:40.083
Faster!

444
00:36:44.708 --> 00:36:47.625
-Fucking car.
-Relax. mom.

445
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:56.791
Speed up.

446
00:36:59.541 --> 00:37:00.833
Turn right.

447
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:07.708
We'll lose them.

448
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:13.583
Two on the right.

449
00:37:14.125 --> 00:37:15.541
Take the gravel road.

450
00:37:18.125 --> 00:37:19.041
To the forest.

451
00:37:25.875 --> 00:37:27.291
Did we lose them?

452
00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:28.458
Follow them!

453
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.250
We're gonna get them.

454
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.125
Happy now?

455
00:37:49.666 --> 00:37:50.583
A boar!

456
00:37:53.166 --> 00:37:54.333
Slow down.

457
00:38:17.416 --> 00:38:21.416
-Everything is fine.
-Stop talking.

458
00:38:23.208 --> 00:38:25.625
-Just go.
-Can you feel your legs?

459
00:38:25.708 --> 00:38:26.916
-No.
-What?

460
00:38:27.416 --> 00:38:28.291
Just kidding.

461
00:38:34.833 --> 00:38:35.666
Come on.

462
00:38:40.166 --> 00:38:41.708
Come on.

463
00:38:46.666 --> 00:38:49.000
Wake up. Can you hear me?

464
00:38:54.458 --> 00:38:55.375
Let's go.

465
00:38:55.458 --> 00:38:58.458
We are. We'll close the door and go.

466
00:39:08.666 --> 00:39:11.791
Hands on your heads!
Step out of the car. shitheads!

467
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.625
Out. young lady.

468
00:39:40.083 --> 00:39:42.458
You're the true Lancelot now.

469
00:39:49.625 --> 00:39:50.666
Hold this.

470
00:39:54.541 --> 00:39:56.125
Thieves!

471
00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:19.458
What happened?

472
00:40:20.166 --> 00:40:21.583
I slipped.

473
00:40:21.666 --> 00:40:23.541
Your stepdad will be pissed.

474
00:40:23.625 --> 00:40:26.166
-You'll ruin our lives.
-You're crazy?

475
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:31.666
Dad has problems. he needs our support
or everything will be fucked!

476
00:40:33.333 --> 00:40:35.750
-Hi.
-Inspector Jaskółka and Federowicz.

477
00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:37.208
We've some questions.

478
00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:39.291
-Sure.
-I'm sorry.

479
00:40:39.375 --> 00:40:40.416
Shoot.

480
00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:41.916
Okay.

481
00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:47.041
Have you noticed…

482
00:40:48.166 --> 00:40:49.416
Sir. have you noticed

483
00:40:50.375 --> 00:40:55.166
anything specific that could lead us
to the offenders?

484
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.916
No. it happened so fast.

485
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.500
Do you recognize this man?

486
00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:03.958
They had balaclavas on.

487
00:41:04.958 --> 00:41:09.583
In this country. when you
earn your success with hard work.

488
00:41:09.666 --> 00:41:12.083
others will bring you back down.

489
00:41:15.583 --> 00:41:16.416
Right.

490
00:41:17.833 --> 00:41:21.500
-They took your briefcase.
-Correct.

491
00:41:21.583 --> 00:41:23.250
From what I know.

492
00:41:23.333 --> 00:41:28.166
it says so in my notes.
you didn't report that.

493
00:41:29.083 --> 00:41:31.166
So. here's my question.

494
00:41:32.125 --> 00:41:33.500
What was inside?

495
00:41:34.041 --> 00:41:39.083
Company's documents. wallet. credit cards…
Who the hell is this guy. Aneta?

496
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.250
Here's the thing.

497
00:41:47.583 --> 00:41:52.458
Why anyone would go to such an extent

498
00:41:52.541 --> 00:41:57.458
to steal a briefcase
that is chained to the wrist?

499
00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:00.833
Call your boss.

500
00:42:00.916 --> 00:42:02.458
You're boring me.

501
00:42:03.916 --> 00:42:07.500
Seriously?
It doesn't work like that anymore.

502
00:42:07.583 --> 00:42:10.666
They knew perfectly well
what was in the briefcase.

503
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:14.333
Let me ask again: what was inside?

504
00:42:14.416 --> 00:42:15.500
Go fuck yourself.

505
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.333
You're boring me.

506
00:42:19.375 --> 00:42:22.375
-Take him away. Aneta.
-I'm sorry.

507
00:42:22.458 --> 00:42:26.416
He's young and ambitious.
Wants to solve that case badly.

508
00:42:27.166 --> 00:42:28.333
How much do you make?

509
00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:32.958
It isn't worth it.

510
00:42:33.041 --> 00:42:35.541
It isn't worth it regardless.

511
00:42:36.166 --> 00:42:38.000
Just one more question.

512
00:42:39.208 --> 00:42:41.375
Where will I find your bodyguards?

513
00:42:42.041 --> 00:42:43.875
Doctor!

514
00:42:43.958 --> 00:42:45.250
I feel weak.

515
00:42:46.875 --> 00:42:48.333
I'm sorry. Kazimierz.

516
00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:51.250
I'll make it up to you.

517
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.416
Is everything okay?

518
00:42:54.708 --> 00:42:56.583
What the fuck are you doing?

519
00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:01.208
That was questioning?

520
00:43:01.875 --> 00:43:04.958
Showing your emotions is not professional.

521
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:07.458
-Who hired you?
-You know him?

522
00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:10.416
You don't?

523
00:43:11.791 --> 00:43:14.791
He has the biggest
ophthalmic clinic in Poland.

524
00:43:14.875 --> 00:43:18.708
You don't know him?
He deals with the National Health Fund.

525
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.208
The Internal Security Agency is involved
and we don't need any--

526
00:43:23.291 --> 00:43:25.333
You don't find it weird at all?

527
00:43:26.625 --> 00:43:29.625
How did a petty thief get involved?

528
00:43:29.708 --> 00:43:33.208
They found a scapegoat.
We need to talk to Chudy.

529
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:35.083
You've lost your mind.

530
00:43:35.833 --> 00:43:37.333
Forget about it.

531
00:44:36.416 --> 00:44:38.500
Hang in there.

532
00:44:38.583 --> 00:44:40.875
Help me. Wajcha.

533
00:44:43.708 --> 00:44:45.625
Three. two . one.

534
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.291
Where are the keys?

535
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.000
Can you hear me? The keys!

536
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.708
I hope grandma doesn't come back.

537
00:45:22.916 --> 00:45:24.250
Don't fall asleep.

538
00:45:30.958 --> 00:45:31.833
Wajcha.

539
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:36.708
Come over here.

540
00:45:37.291 --> 00:45:39.708
Take this.

541
00:45:40.875 --> 00:45:43.166
On the upper gum.

542
00:45:56.625 --> 00:45:58.416
-Phone.
-What?

543
00:46:00.583 --> 00:46:02.583
Marta's number is in the kitchen.

544
00:46:03.333 --> 00:46:05.875
-Somewhere between the bottles.
-It's a bad idea.

545
00:46:05.958 --> 00:46:07.458
Get it. For fuck's sake.

546
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.250
This one?

547
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:32.708
Give it to me.

548
00:46:38.541 --> 00:46:39.375
Hey.

549
00:46:49.041 --> 00:46:49.875
Come--

550
00:46:51.625 --> 00:46:52.791
Come here.

551
00:46:53.875 --> 00:46:55.500
To grandma's.

552
00:46:59.083 --> 00:47:00.291
I can't.

553
00:47:09.708 --> 00:47:10.958
Look at the dough.

554
00:47:17.041 --> 00:47:18.833
Wajcha.

555
00:47:21.458 --> 00:47:23.125
Wajcha? Hey.

556
00:47:23.875 --> 00:47:24.708
Wajcha.

557
00:47:26.291 --> 00:47:27.416
Fuck!

558
00:47:29.666 --> 00:47:32.708
I need a rest.

559
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.208
I haven't seen him.

560
00:47:52.666 --> 00:47:56.000
MAY 1. 2014

561
00:48:19.958 --> 00:48:22.250
-You're here?
-Why so late?

562
00:48:30.333 --> 00:48:31.291
Jesus.

563
00:48:46.166 --> 00:48:47.208
Listen.

564
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:52.583
-Oh my God.
-He'll be fine. A bee stung him.

565
00:48:54.833 --> 00:48:57.875
It must have been quite a bee.

566
00:48:59.833 --> 00:49:00.958
Okay.

567
00:49:18.791 --> 00:49:22.250
The bullet went through.
He's lost a lot of blood.

568
00:49:23.041 --> 00:49:24.208
Leave.

569
00:50:59.125 --> 00:51:01.250
I thought you were not gonna wake up.

570
00:51:02.041 --> 00:51:03.208
Stop it.

571
00:51:04.416 --> 00:51:06.166
I wouldn't dare to.

572
00:51:14.208 --> 00:51:15.541
I'm sorry.

573
00:51:19.958 --> 00:51:22.125
Let me listen to the young lion.

574
00:51:32.916 --> 00:51:34.541
Thanks.

575
00:51:36.125 --> 00:51:37.708
Shall we name him Oskar?

576
00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:43.666
Fuck! I'm dying. Marta.

577
00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:47.250
No. you're not.

578
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:51.708
-How are you?
-Better.

579
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.291
Don't tell her.

580
00:51:57.125 --> 00:52:01.375
Maybe I should know
what you two got yourselves into.

581
00:52:04.416 --> 00:52:05.583
Oskar.

582
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:08.708
What's up?

583
00:52:13.958 --> 00:52:16.000
Thanks for not leaving me.

584
00:52:18.625 --> 00:52:19.875
All by myself.

585
00:52:20.458 --> 00:52:21.625
In the forest.

586
00:52:23.666 --> 00:52:25.041
Don't call me Oskar.

587
00:52:25.833 --> 00:52:28.041
You never leave your bro behind.

588
00:52:28.583 --> 00:52:31.875
You came back for me once.
Remember that. Marta?

589
00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.208
Thanks.

590
00:52:35.166 --> 00:52:37.375
Of course she does.

591
00:52:37.458 --> 00:52:38.833
We're even.

592
00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:45.083
My love.

593
00:52:51.666 --> 00:52:53.916
You want something from the shop?

594
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.166
No. thanks.

595
00:52:57.458 --> 00:52:59.000
I'll make you dinner.

596
00:53:13.041 --> 00:53:16.166
-Oh. boy…
-Leave him alone.

597
00:53:19.666 --> 00:53:21.666
I'm the one who put us in trouble.

598
00:53:25.166 --> 00:53:27.583
<i>Police are looking for two men</i>

It's 148.

615

Wait.

616
00:54:42.666 --> 00:54:43.750
Smokes.

617
00:54:45.833 --> 00:54:46.916
Thanks.

618
00:54:51.083 --> 00:54:52.583
I've brought medicine.

619
00:55:19.541 --> 00:55:20.750
Where's my cash?

620
00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:33.208
It's up to you if you gonna live or die.

621
00:55:34.125 --> 00:55:36.666
Look. Your friend didn't wanna talk.

622
00:55:37.791 --> 00:55:39.166
You're a dead man.

623
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.708
I like you.

624
00:55:57.458 --> 00:55:59.166

Boss?

628

What? A fucking albino?

629
00:56:25.708 --> 00:56:28.000
Fucking hell. Boss?

-What now?
-What?

631
00:56:32.958 --> 00:56:34.541
-You're gonna shoot?
-Yes.

632
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:43.166
Lie still.

633

Marta.

634
00:56:56.666 --> 00:56:57.666
Marta.

635
00:56:58.708 --> 00:56:59.708
Marta!

<i>We'll be rich like fucking banksters.</i>

<i>I'll open my business and be legit.</i>

640
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:08.083
<i>And when my son is born.</i>
<i>I'll be able to look him in the eye.</i>

641
00:59:08.166 --> 00:59:10.041

642
00:59:10.125 --> 00:59:11.625

646

Kruszol. come down to the pawnshop
and bring the guys.

647
01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:23.541
Krime's here.

648
01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:25.916
We'll fuck him up.

649
01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:28.958
Good afternoon.

650
01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:31.083
And goodbye.

651
01:00:32.916 --> 01:00:34.125
Open the door.

652
01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:43.416
Open it.

653
01:00:55.416 --> 01:00:57.208
You're already a dead man.

654
01:01:05.708 --> 01:01:06.875
Who are those people?

655
01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:10.750
-Who are they?
-Military Information Services.

656
01:01:11.708 --> 01:01:16.000
They'll kill you and all your family.

657
01:01:21.708 --> 01:01:24.791
Run. maybe you can still make it.

658
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.750
Why us?

659
01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:38.625
Why?

660
01:01:39.541 --> 01:01:43.000
They needed losers.
You were the perfect choice.

661
01:01:49.166 --> 01:01:50.166
I see.

662
01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:54.208
I see.

663
01:01:57.041 --> 01:02:00.333
We got a call that you harass women

664
01:02:01.541 --> 01:02:03.041
in this area.

665
01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:05.333
-Women?
-By wearing that coat.

666
01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:07.875
-What?
-Well…

667
01:02:07.958 --> 01:02:10.291
It's unbuttoned. you can see nothing.

668
01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:13.041
Maybe. but they're scared.

669
01:02:13.583 --> 01:02:15.375
-They have a reason.
-I don't know…

670
01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:17.750
You're drooling all over them.

671
01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:22.625
-Yes.
-Yes?

672
01:02:24.833 --> 01:02:27.291
Hi. Krime. And now what?

673
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.083
I'll be gentle.

674
01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:37.958
We're not gonna make a scene.

675
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:40.458
What now. bitch?

676
01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:42.708
Easy. Mrówa.

677
01:02:44.083 --> 01:02:46.875
-Go get some ice cream.
-Don't make me stab you.

678
01:02:46.958 --> 01:02:49.916
For fuck's sake.
Okay. but don't start without me.

679
01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:55.416
Go with him.

680
01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.666
Keys and stuff.

681
01:03:00.458 --> 01:03:01.541
Now.

682
01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:03.333
Good.

683
01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:09.708
-Let's go.
-You'll have an adventure.

684
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.750
In the forest.

685
01:03:12.333 --> 01:03:14.375
Don't get the interior all dirty.

686
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.583
You don't want more expenses.

687
01:03:19.333 --> 01:03:22.250
Get the fuck in.

688
01:03:37.708 --> 01:03:40.041
Hey! Dudes!

689
01:03:40.125 --> 01:03:41.500
What the fuck?

690
01:03:42.791 --> 01:03:43.791
Fuck!

691
01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:28.625
<i>Fear is near. in the woods</i>
<i>Arrived the boys in tracksuits</i>

692
01:04:28.708 --> 01:04:30.625
-I loved Backstreet Boys.
-Hello.

693
01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:33.583
-What's up?
-Sorry to scare the fish away.

694
01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:37.291
Piss off. old man.

695
01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:39.250
We're busy here.

696
01:04:40.458 --> 01:04:42.416
You have something mine.

697
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.416
-The car belongs to me now.
-Really?

698
01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.625
-Really.
-Really?

699
01:04:47.166 --> 01:04:49.666
Are you deaf? Get the fuck out!

700
01:04:51.625 --> 01:04:52.750
Quickly.

701
01:04:53.291 --> 01:04:54.583
Hop in the car.

702
01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:58.875
I just want to chat
with that ginger faggot.

703
01:04:59.541 --> 01:05:00.541
But I get it.

704
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.541
-What is he doing?
-Hey!

705
01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:10.791
-Fucking chill! We can talk this over.
-No. we fucking can't.

706
01:07:43.416 --> 01:07:45.000
We got pretty lucky.

707
01:07:46.291 --> 01:07:48.291
We're stuck with each other.

708
01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:51.083
So?

709
01:07:52.291 --> 01:07:53.375
Lucky?

710
01:07:57.208 --> 01:07:58.041
Lucky.

711
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.583
What?

712
01:08:34.666 --> 01:08:37.000
<i>Hey! Ready to party?</i>

713
01:08:37.875 --> 01:08:39.583
What party?

714
01:08:39.666 --> 01:08:40.500
<i>You dimwit!</i>

715
01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:42.625
I told you. Hip-hop party.

716
01:08:42.708 --> 01:08:44.458
Today in the Ferr Club.

717
01:08:45.208 --> 01:08:47.375
<i>Filthy hats will show up?</i>

718
01:08:48.083 --> 01:08:51.666
No. but naughty boys will come.

719
01:08:54.416 --> 01:08:56.083
I'm not into that.

720
01:08:56.625 --> 01:08:58.458
<i>Come on. I'm in the car outside.</i>

721
01:08:58.541 --> 01:09:00.208
I'm grounded.

722
01:09:00.291 --> 01:09:03.083
My dad's at the hospital
and mom locked me in.

723
01:09:03.166 --> 01:09:05.250
Think of something. bitch.

724
01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:07.250
Give me a sec.

725
01:09:08.041 --> 01:09:10.291
<i>-Bye.</i>
-See you. slut.

726
01:09:27.541 --> 01:09:29.583
I'll get you. albino.

727
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.500
Got a little mess on the beach.

728
01:09:36.958 --> 01:09:38.541
I'll send you the coordinates.

729
01:09:39.083 --> 01:09:41.666
Yes. clean up. Four bin bags. one ours.

730
01:09:42.208 --> 01:09:43.125
The driver.

731
01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:44.916
Life is harsh.

732
01:09:45.458 --> 01:09:47.208
Get rid of the bodies.

733
01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.083
Over.

734
01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:51.208
Yes.

735
01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:21.166
What happened?

736
01:10:22.416 --> 01:10:24.500
-Wajcha is dead.
-What?

737
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:26.750
Get inside.

738
01:10:34.708 --> 01:10:35.791
Wajcha is dead?

739
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:41.875
Here you go.

740
01:10:44.875 --> 01:10:46.250
Best if I'm not seen.

741
01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:49.875
Didn't get money again.

742
01:10:49.958 --> 01:10:54.041
-Oh. well.
-You never pay for yourself anyway.

743
01:10:55.291 --> 01:10:58.416
We'll figure something out. As always.

744
01:10:58.500 --> 01:10:59.458
Come on.

745
01:11:04.208 --> 01:11:06.208
-Hey.
-Hi. girls.

746
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Boss is upstairs. You need to pay today.

747
01:11:11.875 --> 01:11:13.916
-What?
-You need to pay.

748
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.375
Won't you let us in?

749
01:11:17.083 --> 01:11:18.250
Wait.

750
01:11:18.958 --> 01:11:22.125
I'll give you a towel and some clothes.

751
01:11:22.208 --> 01:11:25.166
I pay for your fucking time.
Get back to the mixer.

752
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:26.708
Be right back.

753
01:11:26.791 --> 01:11:28.625
-Get back now.
-Wait.

754
01:11:28.708 --> 01:11:31.208
-Why you need a gun?
-I'll get rid of him.

755
01:11:31.875 --> 01:11:33.666
Nuta. come back here.

756
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:36.333
-Wait a second.
-I don't have the time.

757
01:11:36.416 --> 01:11:37.958
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

758
01:11:39.333 --> 01:11:41.000
You're not getting paid.

759
01:11:41.083 --> 01:11:43.208
I'll be back in a second.

760
01:11:47.291 --> 01:11:48.166
Play it.

761
01:12:38.583 --> 01:12:39.791
Hi. girls.

762
01:12:41.125 --> 01:12:43.583
Do you have a company for tonight?

763
01:12:45.041 --> 01:12:48.666
-Maybe we do.
-Maybe we don't.

764
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.166
Come with me.

765
01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.875
Can I hit on you?

766
01:13:15.416 --> 01:13:16.916
You want some drinks?

767
01:13:18.458 --> 01:13:19.541
Are you buying?

768
01:13:20.458 --> 01:13:22.666
-It's on me.
-So. let's go.

769
01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:55.208
<i>Drinks. codeine. Rolex with diamonds</i>
<i>The bitch is holding it in her hand</i>

770
01:13:56.041 --> 01:13:59.041
<i>Don't walk up to me bitch</i>
<i>I won't be fucking nice</i>

771
01:13:59.125 --> 01:14:01.125
<i>I'm counting a lot of cash</i>
<i>A lot of cash</i>

772
01:14:01.833 --> 01:14:04.166
<i>Cold ice on my wrist</i>
<i>Fuck yeah</i>

773
01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:06.208
<i>Fucking awesome</i>

774
01:14:12.041 --> 01:14:14.041
-Nice?
-Awesome.

775
01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:16.541
Masterpiece.

776
01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:20.541
-What?
-How much are you charging those morons?

777
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:26.708
Are you fucking lost?
It's a musical studio. cunt.

778
01:14:26.791 --> 01:14:29.333
-I'm sorry.
-You better be.

779
01:14:29.416 --> 01:14:31.958
-You know who the fuck I am?
-No.

780
01:14:32.041 --> 01:14:33.833
So shut the fuck up.

781
01:14:33.916 --> 01:14:37.416
-What the hell?
-Cut it out. boys.

782
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.958
-Have you lost your mind?
-Kica. calm down.

783
01:14:40.583 --> 01:14:43.208
-Fucking hell.
-Easy! You'll fuck my studio.

784
01:14:43.291 --> 01:14:46.500
-Fine. Tie your laces.
-Chill!

785
01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:47.583
-Laces.
-Stop it!

786
01:14:47.666 --> 01:14:49.666
Rev!

787
01:14:53.416 --> 01:14:55.708
Welcome. everyone!

788
01:14:57.958 --> 01:15:00.250
Are you having fun?

789
01:15:02.333 --> 01:15:05.666
Put your hands in the air!

790
01:15:52.958 --> 01:15:55.500
I'm taking a week off.

791
01:15:55.583 --> 01:15:58.750
POLICE

792
01:15:58.833 --> 01:16:00.416
To be with my family.

793
01:16:03.541 --> 01:16:05.250
-I heard that.
-Thank you.

794
01:16:14.916 --> 01:16:20.791
I've got tipped off by our informer
about the whereabouts of our suspect.

795
01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:26.333
-Which one?
-Well. I guess it's…

796
01:16:26.416 --> 01:16:28.875
Chudy. the one you're after.

797
01:16:30.708 --> 01:16:35.125
The CI saw him fifteen minutes ago
in a studio on Żelazna Street.

798
01:16:40.791 --> 01:16:41.833
Thanks.

799
01:16:48.625 --> 01:16:50.000
Has she been good?

800
01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:56.791
So she will be fucked.

801
01:16:57.708 --> 01:17:00.250
-What?
-Dick needs to get wet.

802
01:17:00.333 --> 01:17:01.666
Let go of me!

803
01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:05.250
Leave me!

804
01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:08.833
Get off!

805
01:17:10.791 --> 01:17:13.041
Let go of me!

806
01:17:15.041 --> 01:17:16.500
Let go!

807
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.458
-I need to talk to him.
-Cops!

808
01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:33.750
Chudy. trust me and don't run.

809
01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:41.291
-Open up!
-Take this with you.

810
01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:43.083
I'll look after Lucky.

811
01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.333
Now!

812
01:18:40.458 --> 01:18:41.375
Come inside.

813
01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:45.083
Chudy?

814
01:18:53.291 --> 01:18:54.416
I just wanna talk.

815
01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.208
I can help you! Watch out!

816
01:19:03.166 --> 01:19:06.083
What the fuck is going on. Lucky?

817
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:36.208
Fuck off!

818
01:19:46.083 --> 01:19:47.041
Now.

819
01:19:48.916 --> 01:19:49.833
Now.

820
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.333
Can you hear me?

821
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.416
I'm here. Do you hear me?

822
01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:20.000
Open your eyes. please.

823
01:20:39.708 --> 01:20:40.833
Breathe.

824
01:20:47.333 --> 01:20:50.791
Don't go towards the light.
Focus on living.

825
01:20:51.458 --> 01:20:53.416
Can you hear me? What's your name?

826
01:20:54.625 --> 01:20:55.833
Hey.

827
01:21:04.041 --> 01:21:06.000
Hang in there.

828
01:21:07.458 --> 01:21:09.416
Yes. yes!

829
01:21:10.875 --> 01:21:12.458
Do you hear me? I'm here.

830
01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:14.625
Look at me.

831
01:21:15.416 --> 01:21:17.000
I'm here.

832
01:21:30.666 --> 01:21:32.000
Look at me.

833
01:21:33.333 --> 01:21:35.333
It's okay. 911?

A young woman.

835
01:21:44.208 --> 01:21:46.875
Open your eyes.

836

I'm here. Look at me.

837
01:21:57.416 --> 01:21:58.791
I'll put you down. okay?

838
01:22:07.791 --> 01:22:09.000
See?

839
01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:11.958
Hi.

840
01:22:12.958 --> 01:22:15.375
-What's up?
-He got shot.

841
01:22:15.958 --> 01:22:17.708
Can you hear me?

842
01:22:17.791 --> 01:22:19.166
-Gunshot.
-One sec.

843
01:22:24.291 --> 01:22:26.208
-Will it take long?
-All yours.

844
01:22:26.291 --> 01:22:27.666
Sir?

845
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.375
Move.

846
01:22:52.291 --> 01:22:54.291
He's dead.

847
01:22:54.375 --> 01:22:56.875
Bring the black bag. I'll call the police.

848
01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:38.125
Let us through. We've got a dying girl.

849
01:23:38.208 --> 01:23:40.583
-Who's in there?
-Nobody.

850
01:23:41.291 --> 01:23:43.458
-Nobody.
-Why is she answering?

851
01:23:44.958 --> 01:23:46.875
She's gonna die.

852
01:23:46.958 --> 01:23:49.208
-Let us through.
-Go.

853
01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:50.916
-A new girl?
-Yeah.

854
01:23:51.916 --> 01:23:54.875
-Go.
-See you on Saturday. Get drinks.

855
01:23:58.208 --> 01:24:00.041
You'll never leave her again.

856
01:24:02.083 --> 01:24:03.750
You love her.

857
01:24:03.833 --> 01:24:06.375
Hey. look at that.

858
01:24:06.958 --> 01:24:09.291
Love at first sight.

859
01:24:11.208 --> 01:24:13.083
She holds you so tightly.

860
01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:15.250
Give me her ID.

861
01:24:16.916 --> 01:24:18.250
Pass it to him.

862
01:24:20.375 --> 01:24:21.416
Give it to him.

863
01:24:29.541 --> 01:24:33.333
We've got a heavily beaten girl.
Kamila Wójcik. age…

864
01:24:34.791 --> 01:24:35.875
Nineteen.

865
01:24:36.583 --> 01:24:38.708
You're my angel.

866
01:25:00.375 --> 01:25:02.583
Promise you're not gonna leave me.

867
01:25:07.583 --> 01:25:08.583
Yes.

868
01:25:10.916 --> 01:25:11.916
Yes.

869
01:26:04.416 --> 01:26:06.666
The gun didn't fire for a reason.

870
01:26:09.125 --> 01:26:11.083
God has another plan for you.

871
01:26:21.166 --> 01:26:22.333
For the old favor.

872
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:38.291
I don't smoke.

873
01:27:05.041 --> 01:27:06.083
<i>For the old favor.</i>

874
01:27:42.375 --> 01:27:43.708
MESSAGES

875
01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:47.750
WE'D DROP BY. BUT HOSPITALS STINK.
LET US KNOW WHEN YOU'RE OUT.

876
01:27:47.833 --> 01:27:49.333
What does it say?

877
01:27:54.875 --> 01:27:56.041
See?

878
01:27:57.375 --> 01:27:59.416
Friends are worried about you.

879
01:28:01.166 --> 01:28:04.250
Smile. sunshine.

880
01:28:12.166 --> 01:28:13.250
Kamila.

881
01:28:18.791 --> 01:28:21.041
I'm sorry for everything. Mom.

882
01:28:38.208 --> 01:28:39.833
Don't ever be sorry.

883
01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:47.458
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

884
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:49.958
What's wrong?

885
01:28:50.875 --> 01:28:51.958
Did someone die?

886
01:28:52.041 --> 01:28:54.000
What's that supposed to be?

887
01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:02.708
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

888
01:29:02.791 --> 01:29:09.791
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

889
01:29:10.458 --> 01:29:15.250
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

890
01:29:15.333 --> 01:29:17.541
-To who?
-Kamila!

891
01:30:41.291 --> 01:30:42.708
HELLO!

892
01:30:42.791 --> 01:30:44.416
HI!

893
01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:47.416
I HAVE YOUR NECKLACE.

894
01:31:06.208 --> 01:31:08.375
WHY SO SILENT?

895
01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:37.458
Look up.

896
01:31:56.916 --> 01:31:58.125
Shall we go there?

897
01:32:01.125 --> 01:32:02.166
Come on.

898
01:32:47.416 --> 01:32:48.291
Hi.

899
01:32:58.041 --> 01:33:00.416
-I had to see you.
-You're not going!

900
01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:01.666
Kamila?

901
01:33:02.666 --> 01:33:05.166
-Forget about it.
-You've got a guard?

902
01:33:06.291 --> 01:33:07.125
Even two.

903
01:33:08.125 --> 01:33:09.125
It's you.

904
01:33:12.666 --> 01:33:15.333
I was joking. Are you going out?

905
01:33:16.583 --> 01:33:18.541
Yes. This is Oskar.

906
01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:20.750
Don't stand like that.

907
01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.250
My dog's in the car.

908
01:33:28.458 --> 01:33:30.625
So we're off. Bye. daddy.

909
01:33:30.708 --> 01:33:33.666
-Do you have a cucumber salad?
-Yes.

910
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:36.333
-I'll take it.
-And for the daughter?

911
01:33:39.375 --> 01:33:41.166
The same thing as for my dad.

912
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.208
With cucumber salad.
And double whiskey for dessert.

913
01:33:47.791 --> 01:33:49.541
-With ice.
-For the dad?

914
01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:55.291
Make it two. Thank you.

915
01:33:56.583 --> 01:33:57.708
Of course.

916
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.041
I would like to propose a toast.

917
01:34:06.625 --> 01:34:09.041
To what? To pork chop?

918
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:14.500
To honesty.

919
01:35:20.208 --> 01:35:21.125
Kamila.

920
01:35:25.375 --> 01:35:26.208
Kamila.

921
01:35:37.291 --> 01:35:38.333
I'm sorry.

922
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:41.708
It's not what you think.

923
01:35:49.958 --> 01:35:53.250
You deserve someone better than me.
You hear me?

924
01:35:59.458 --> 01:36:01.500
You promised you'd never leave me.

925
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:04.291
I don't want to leave you.

926
01:36:11.166 --> 01:36:12.875
You'll never be safe with me.

927
01:36:44.958 --> 01:36:46.916
So… bye?

928
01:36:53.791 --> 01:36:54.958
In that case…

929
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:56.958
bye.

930
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:59.000
Any plans for tomorrow?

931
01:37:01.583 --> 01:37:02.958
It depends.

932
01:37:05.375 --> 01:37:07.500
I'll show you the land of happiness.

933
01:37:09.666 --> 01:37:12.791
Sounds interesting. Go on.

934
01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:16.666
Go on? Pack your things for two days
and you'll see.

935
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.833
I don't know if they'll let me.

936
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:23.458
I forgot.

937
01:37:25.708 --> 01:37:26.750
Kiddo.

938
01:37:27.541 --> 01:37:29.375
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

939
01:37:29.958 --> 01:37:30.875
Kiddo.

940
01:37:31.541 --> 01:37:33.500
Six o'clock. Can you make it?

941
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.250
Two coffees to go.

942
01:39:03.375 --> 01:39:07.875
And if my parents ask me what you do…

943
01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:10.916
what should I tell them?

944
01:39:17.125 --> 01:39:19.250
Never mind. Whatever.

945
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:22.583
It was a stupid question.

946
01:39:33.958 --> 01:39:37.750
-I did many bad things.
-You don't have to tell me.

947
01:39:42.041 --> 01:39:43.250
I know.

948
01:39:45.416 --> 01:39:47.666
But my best friend died because of me.

949
01:39:59.125 --> 01:40:00.041
And…

950
01:40:01.291 --> 01:40:03.041
I don't wanna talk about it.

951
01:40:03.125 --> 01:40:06.041
Since you crossed my path
everything is different.

952
01:40:09.791 --> 01:40:11.791
For once in my life I want to…

953
01:40:13.458 --> 01:40:14.458
do something…

954
01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:15.833
Something good?

955
01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:19.958
Exactly. Something good.

956
01:40:21.666 --> 01:40:23.333
Something really good.

957
01:40:25.625 --> 01:40:26.875
You already did.

958
01:41:40.541 --> 01:41:41.375
My home.

959
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.750
You've done a lot of bad things.

960
01:43:32.333 --> 01:43:36.125
but my life wasn't perfect either.

961
01:43:38.541 --> 01:43:41.625
Let's run away where no one can find us.

962
01:43:44.958 --> 01:43:45.875
Okay.

963
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.416
Let's do that tomorrow.

964
01:43:49.291 --> 01:43:51.000
I wanna stay here a bit longer.

965
01:43:55.916 --> 01:43:57.666
We'll have an amazing evening.

966
01:44:11.958 --> 01:44:13.333
I'll get food for the road.

967
01:44:25.166 --> 01:44:27.416
Leave it. Lucky.

968
01:44:30.416 --> 01:44:31.375
Wait!

969
01:44:34.291 --> 01:44:36.125
Let's take a photo.

970
01:44:36.208 --> 01:44:38.041
I stepped on something.

971
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:54.375
Don't publish it anywhere.

972
01:44:54.458 --> 01:44:56.166
-I won't.
-All right?

973
01:45:00.125 --> 01:45:02.333
Why do you have red nails at work?

974
01:45:03.250 --> 01:45:05.833
-I'm only answering the phone.
-Answer me.

975
01:45:07.416 --> 01:45:09.041
-I…
-We've discussed it.

976
01:45:09.666 --> 01:45:11.625
Is this a brothel or the police?

977
01:45:18.250 --> 01:45:20.125
Chudy is with the Wójcik girl.

978
01:45:20.625 --> 01:45:23.083
The daughter of your briefcase guy.

979
01:45:23.166 --> 01:45:26.291
-Where is that?
-Somewhere by the sea.

980
01:45:26.833 --> 01:45:28.708
Really? Not in the mountains?

981
01:45:29.291 --> 01:45:31.125
-Check it. Baśka.
-Okay.

982
01:45:32.333 --> 01:45:33.416
Do you have a gun?

983
01:45:34.375 --> 01:45:35.291
Me?

984
01:45:35.375 --> 01:45:36.208
-You.
-I do.

985
01:45:36.291 --> 01:45:38.625
-Come with me.
-I've never done it before.

986
01:45:38.708 --> 01:45:42.083
-It's high time.
-I've been working on this for two years.

987
01:45:43.125 --> 01:45:44.291
If you have to.

988
01:45:46.583 --> 01:45:49.000
Might be nasty. I'll take another gun.

989
01:45:51.291 --> 01:45:52.416
We've got him.

990
01:45:55.625 --> 01:45:57.208
Nowakowski Oskar.

991
01:45:58.333 --> 01:46:02.000
Raised in an orphanage.
Convicted of theft twice.

992
01:46:02.083 --> 01:46:04.125
Clean for five years.

993
01:46:04.208 --> 01:46:08.166
Mother unknown.
Father died in a car accident.

994
01:46:11.625 --> 01:46:12.833
Carry me!

995
01:46:19.041 --> 01:46:20.083
Look. jellyfish.

996
01:46:29.625 --> 01:46:31.958
I've read about this.

997
01:46:34.708 --> 01:46:37.500
The robbery and your disappearance…

998
01:46:38.416 --> 01:46:39.791
It's not a coincidence.

999
01:46:43.583 --> 01:46:44.416
Maybe.

1000
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.125
The guy who you robbed…

1001
01:46:50.458 --> 01:46:51.708
is not my dad.

1002
01:46:53.250 --> 01:46:54.083
Really?

1003
01:46:59.458 --> 01:47:00.875
You know I'm an orphan?

1004
01:47:05.250 --> 01:47:08.166
The only memory I have of my parents…

1005
01:47:10.333 --> 01:47:12.541
is this place. this beach.

1006
01:47:19.708 --> 01:47:21.541
Don't you fucking move!

1007
01:47:32.458 --> 01:47:34.583
-You'll scare her.
-On the ground.

1008
01:47:35.166 --> 01:47:36.666
Hands on your head.

1009
01:47:37.666 --> 01:47:39.833
Easy. Aneta. They're not armed.

1010
01:47:39.916 --> 01:47:40.833
Stay out of it.

1011
01:47:42.333 --> 01:47:45.250
You wanted to come?
Shoot him or I'll do it.

1012
01:47:49.416 --> 01:47:50.875
What are you staring at?

1013
01:47:53.625 --> 01:47:54.916
I remember you.

1014
01:47:57.250 --> 01:47:58.291
I remember.

1015
01:47:59.291 --> 01:48:01.875
Are you fucking insane?
It's not Wild Wild West!

1016
01:48:01.958 --> 01:48:02.833
Talk. Chudy!

1017
01:48:04.083 --> 01:48:06.333
You've got a great partner.

1018
01:48:06.416 --> 01:48:08.458
-You like killing girls.
-Shut up!

1019
01:48:08.541 --> 01:48:10.916
I remember you dragging her to the van.

1020
01:48:11.708 --> 01:48:13.958
Are you fucking mad?!

1021
01:48:24.958 --> 01:48:26.416
I'm not done with you yet.

1022
01:48:27.166 --> 01:48:29.625
Come here. cocksucker.

1023
01:48:29.708 --> 01:48:31.625
I'll blow your fucking head off.

1024
01:48:33.708 --> 01:48:37.458
You put your make-up on. You make faces.

1025
01:48:37.541 --> 01:48:39.916
You take selfies in your underwear.

1026
01:48:40.708 --> 01:48:45.958
And it never occurs to you
that you're hurting people.

1027
01:48:47.875 --> 01:48:49.791
A little birdie has escaped.

1028
01:48:52.583 --> 01:48:54.250
Why are you doing this?

1029
01:48:58.541 --> 01:49:01.208
You know how it feels
to have a kid taken away?

1030
01:49:04.375 --> 01:49:05.708
Do you?

1031
01:49:07.708 --> 01:49:09.833
When you're hugging your son…

1032
01:49:14.166 --> 01:49:18.916
Your sweet little baby with blond curls…

1033
01:49:20.708 --> 01:49:22.958
who you love the most in the world.

1034
01:49:24.916 --> 01:49:26.458
And he takes him away.

1035
01:49:27.250 --> 01:49:31.916
saying that you're too young to raise him.
because you're only 16 years old.

1036
01:49:33.708 --> 01:49:38.166
And then disappears
with some slut from the disco.

1037
01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:39.833
That's why I'm doing that.

1038
01:49:41.583 --> 01:49:43.750
Oskar has the same mark.

1039
01:49:48.791 --> 01:49:49.791
Oskar.

1040
01:49:53.250 --> 01:49:55.541
Look at me.

1041
01:49:57.583 --> 01:49:58.958
It's gonna be fine.

1042
01:50:00.833 --> 01:50:01.875
It's gonna be fine.

1043
01:54:59.958 --> 01:55:05.083
