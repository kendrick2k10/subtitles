3
00:01:34.163 --> 00:01:34.996
- Oh.

4
00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:57.974
Phew.

5
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.980
Are you Adam?

6
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.813
- I am.

7
00:03:55.813 --> 00:03:56.830
- Hi. Sydney.

8
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.290
Nice to meet.
- You too.

9
00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.440
You too. please. have a seat.

10
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.273
- Thank you.

11
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.750
- Thank you so much for meeting me.

12
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.390
- Oh. it's my pleasure.

13
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.490
I have heard great things about you.

14
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.880
- They are all lies.

15
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.053
- Well. I assumed.

16
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.360
- So did you get a chance
to read the script?

17
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.317
- To read "Macbeth"?

18
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.580
- Yeah. but I was just joking.

19
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.913
- Oh. right.

20
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.960
- So I guess I'll tell you a little bit

21
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.240
about the concept for this
production. which is hard to do

22
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.133
because I don't have a
concept for this production.

23
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.000
It seems to me that when
people direct Shakespeare.

24
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.380
they get so intimidated by
the 400 years of history

25
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.380
and legend that they cling to
an idea of what the play is

26
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.150
or what they could make it.

27
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.810
You know. my "Macbeth".

28
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.580
My "Macbeth" is about sexual frustration.

29
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.220
My "Macbeth" is about
prohibition era Chicago

30
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.710
My "Macbeth" is about dancing monkeys.

31
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.420
You know. anything to
avoid the paralyzing terror

32
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.450
of directing the actual play.

33
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.830
- So you're aiming for a
more faithful production?

34
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.973
- No. not faithful. um.

35
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.910
I mean. yes. faithful. but
not to the play's history.

36
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.590
not to the play's period.

37
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.480
to the play. you know. the play.

38
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.370
- Yeah. I think I get you.

39
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.590
- And I mean. look. I know
that we all say this. right.

40
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.340
but it's about the text.
that we're serving the text.

41
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.910
We all say that. but it's lip service.

42
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.730
99% of Shakespeare productions

43
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.560
are about the director's clever ideas.

44
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.800
But the thing is that no one
gives a shit about your ideas.

45
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.620
Directing is not an intellectual pursuit.

46
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.960
It's a craft. you know.

47
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.300
get the play up on its
feet. get it running.

48
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.133
Let it.

49
00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:44.784
let it play.

50
00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:50.457
Am I making any sense?

51
00:05:51.444 --> 00:05:53.863
- Yes. you are.

52
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.553
- I'm sorry.

53
00:05:55.553 --> 00:05:59.283
I. I just launched into this
whole soliloquy. I guess.

54
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.710
what I'm trying to say.
- Adam. do you mind

55
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.110
if I make this easy for you?

56
00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:06.723
- No. I don't.

57
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.783
- I need to work.

58
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.930
I need a break from the city.

59
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.700
I don't want to do another stupid movie.

60
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.327
Massachusetts is lovely.

61
00:06:15.327 --> 00:06:17.370
"Macbeth" is "Macbeth".

62
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.230
So I didn't come here to be convinced.

63
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.613
I came here to see if you
were actively unbearable.

64
00:06:26.223 --> 00:06:30.220
- And am I?

65
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.213
- Not so far.

66
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.710
- So you're saying?

67
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.650
- I'm saying yes.

68
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.920
- Like yes. yes?

69
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.233
- I don't know what that means. but yes.

70
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.333
- That's great.

71
00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:43.533
That is extremely great.

72
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.456
I love your work. it'll
be an honor to direct you.

73
00:06:47.456 --> 00:06:49.751
- No. no. no. no. you cannot pull that.

74
00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:50.658
- What?

75
00:06:50.658 --> 00:06:52.647
- It's an honor to work with you.

76
00:06:52.647 --> 00:06:54.197
You don't get to be starstruck.

77
00:06:55.056 --> 00:06:56.423
You have to direct.

78
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.300
- Okay.

79
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.133
Okay.

80
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
- I'm really glad that you're doing this.

81
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.993
- Yeah.

82
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.943
Yeah. me too.

83
00:07:42.637 --> 00:07:45.700
- Breakfast is normally 7:30.

84
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.880
We can do later. but try and
let us know the evening before.

85
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.123
- 7:30 is good.

86
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.333
- You stayed with us before. haven't you?

87
00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:56.683
A long time ago.

88
00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.580
- Well.

89
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.693
Welcome back.

90
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.453
- Thanks.

91
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:06.940
- This work for you?

92
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.083
- It's perfect.

93
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.100
- Then I'll let you settle in.

94
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.944
You just shout if you need anything.

95
00:08:13.944 --> 00:08:17.400
I don't hear too good
these days. so shout loud.

96
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.293
- I can handle that.
- Good girl.

97
00:08:21.476 --> 00:08:22.643
Oh.

98
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.523
Sydney!

99
00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:30.424
- Oh.

100
00:08:31.756 --> 00:08:32.589
- Ah!

101
00:08:34.042 --> 00:08:34.875
- Hi!
- Oh.

102
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.170
- I heard you were coming.
but I didn't believe it.

103
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.371
Sydney Levison in the flesh.

104
00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:42.050
What brings you back to the provinces?

105
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.800
Did Hollywood chew you
up and spit you out?

106
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.920
- Eh. more or less.

107
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.500
- Good. ah. no. no. no!

108
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.490
Good. so much the better for the theater.

109
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.120
Oh. let me have a look at you.

110
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.708
God. you look delicious.

111
00:08:53.708 --> 00:08:54.560
- Oh!

112
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.520
- What's new. something's new.

113
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.080
New lover. new haircut. facelift?

114
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.770
- Nothing's new. Hugh.

115
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.540
- That I don't for a moment believe.

116
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.050
Oh listen. I was just
about to go into town

117
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.748
because the bar here is
hopelessly understocked.

118
00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:09.581
is there anything you need?

119
00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:11.520
- No. no. I'm fine.

120
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.410
- Well. I'll be back

121
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.990
and we are not on call
until tomorrow morning.

122
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.960
So I expect to be drinking with you

123
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.590
until the wee hours. all right.

124
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.630
- Mm-hm. we'll see.

125
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.863
- Well. it's good enough.

126
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.490
Oh God. it's good to see you.

127
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.510
- It's great to see you too. Hugh.

128
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.000
- Oh. all right.

129
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.100
I'll be back.
- Okay.

130
00:09:37.132 --> 00:09:37.965
Oh.

131
00:10:03.182 --> 00:10:06.260
Well. you made yourself right at home.

132
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.553
- Sydney. you made it.

133
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.020
- No. no. no. no. don't get up.

134
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.499
You're too picturesque.

135
00:10:12.499 --> 00:10:14.660
- Well. then sit down please.

136
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.493
- Thanks.

137
00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:18.070
- Did you find the place okay?

138
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.260
- Yes.

139
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.340
Yes. I did.

140
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.263
- You must've stayed here before.

141
00:10:22.263 --> 00:10:24.490
- Troilus and Cressida.

142
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:29.040
I was 23 and the place
has changed not at all.

143
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.630
- It must be kind of comforting.

144
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.003
- Uh. yes and no.

145
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.180
It reminds me of how much I've changed.

146
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.540
- Like how?

147
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.260
- I was 23.

148
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.663
I was in love with
theater. in love with life.

149
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.153
and I was also in love.

150
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.403
- And now?

151
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.065
- Oh. you're very good at that.

152
00:10:52.065 --> 00:10:53.284
What?

153
00:10:53.284 --> 00:10:57.760
- The innocuous question
that leads to the revelation.

154
00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.770
You might be a good director.

155
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:00.960
- Oh. thanks.

156
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.516
I'm trying to be.

157
00:11:02.516 --> 00:11:03.780
- Is this your first time here?

158
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.490
- First time working.

159
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.257
Yeah. I used to come up here

160
00:11:07.257 --> 00:11:08.913
and see things whenever I could.

161
00:11:09.801 --> 00:11:11.700
It's kind of a trek from the city though.

162
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.533
That's why I like it.

163
00:11:12.533 --> 00:11:13.366
- Yeah. me too.

164
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.810
- Well. don't mind me.

165
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.810
I'm just going to sit here and read.

166
00:11:28.837 --> 00:11:32.020
- "Agricultural Practice
in Early New England".

167
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.350
Huh.

168
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.710
- Look. I don't judge your hobbies.

169
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:36.950
- You're right.

170
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:37.783
Sorry.

171
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.205
You wanna go for a walk?

172
00:12:10.205 --> 00:12:11.555
- I thought you'd never ask

173
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.550
- You think he ever dreamed
that 400 years later

174
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.780
we'd still be hanging his name on banners?

175
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.613
- Probably not.

176
00:12:22.989 --> 00:12:26.930
- You know. Emerson said that
aliens. if there are aliens.

177
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.640
would probably call
this planet Shakespeare.

178
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.320
- Emerson wrote about aliens?

179
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.523
- Apparently so. yeah.

180
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.070
Read about it on Wikipedia.

181
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.120
- If there are aliens.

182
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.270
they'd probably call
this planet Wikipedia.

183
00:12:41.117 --> 00:12:42.017
- That maybe true.

184
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.240
- Hey. you know what's cool?

185
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.283
- No. what's cool?

186
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.650
- Plymouth. Massachusetts.

187
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.240
It's the first English
colony in the Northeast.

188
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.223
It's only like 20 miles away from here.

189
00:12:57.093 --> 00:13:00.560
It was founded just a few
years after Shakespeare died.

190
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.030
And Jamestown was established in 1607.

191
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.450
which is right about the same
time "Macbeth" was written.

192
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.720
And his last play "The Tempest"

193
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.693
is all about discovering a new world.

194
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.350
And there's almost like.

195
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.110
in the great sweep of Western history.

196
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:22.000
this like passing on the baton
from Shakespeare to America.

197
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.963
Like. all right. well.
we'll take it from here.

198
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.750
- What are you some kind of optimist?

199
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.760
- In certain moods.

200
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.250
- Don't worry. your secret's safe with me.

201
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.633
- Thank God for that.

202
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.150
- Welcome. everyone to the
first day of rehearsal.

203
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.540
My name is Adam and I will
be your least favorite person

204
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.999
for the next three weeks.

205
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.620
Um. there's something I'd like to address

206
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.340
before we get started.

207
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.543
Let's just get it out of the
way and move on. shall we.

208
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:35.823
The curse.

209
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.750
Now look. everyone is
entitled to their own opinion

210
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.140
about whether or not magic exists.

211
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.130
but I am here to tell you this.

212
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.160
I have dug deep into the allegations

213
00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.750
of a curse on the play "Macbeth".

214
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.160
I have done more research on the question

215
00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.390
than anyone should ever dream of doing.

216
00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:01.390
I have spoken to historians.
scholars. experts on the occult

217
00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:07.050
and I can say with great
authority. there is no curse.

218
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.340
There is no history of troubled
productions of this play.

219
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.680
Any more than any other
play that's been performed

220
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.370
for 400 years. the witch's
scene does not contain

221
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.310
the text of a real spell.

222
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.830
The play's not hexed by
witches' some sort of revenge.

223
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.020
And we all know the rumors.
we've heard the superstitions.

224
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.580
We can't even say the word "Macbeth".

225
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:35.510
We have to say The Scottish
play. Mackers. et cetera.

226
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.340
And some of us have even
experienced some creepy accidents

227
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.410
while working on this play.

228
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.860
But that is just a coincidence.

229
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.930
It is not the effect of black magic.

230
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.910
And the only thing that we
really need to be afraid

231
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:52.090
of is putting on a mediocre show.

232
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:52.923
- Hear. hear!

233
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.040
- Thank you. Hugh.

234
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.873
All right.

235
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.570
Should we give this sucker a read?

236
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.200
- Quick question. Adam?

237
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.170
- Yes. Hugh?

238
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.073
- What's that?

239
00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.750
- All right. whoever
you are. it's not funny!

240
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.600
Please get out or I'll call security.

241
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:23.280
Don't
put on a mediocre show.

242
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.083
- We won't.

243
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.713
Okay. we won't. thank you.

244
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.970
- You heard the man.

245
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:42.803
Let's get started.

246
00:16:42.803 --> 00:16:44.530
Act one. scene one.

247
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:45.940
Lauren. please.

248
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.353
- Okay. thunder and lightning
enter three witches.

249
00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.600
- Ladies and gentlemen to the
Bard of Stratford-upon-Avon.

250
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:02.623
Cheers!

251
00:17:04.927 --> 00:17:07.377
- And now. I think we'd
all like to hear a speech

252
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.983
from our fearless leader.

253
00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.010
Adam. the floor is yours.

254
00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.820
- Oh God. do I have to?

255
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.392
- You have to.

256
00:17:15.392 --> 00:17:16.716
- Adam.
- Come on. Adam.

257
00:17:16.716 --> 00:17:19.549
- Let's go.
- All right. all right.

258
00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:23.573
I'm not much of a speech maker.

259
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.390
I'd rather let the Bard speak
for me most of the time.

260
00:17:37.035 --> 00:17:41.085
I do want to say that I am
very grateful to be here.

261
00:17:41.085 --> 00:17:42.950
I'm very grateful for this place.

262
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.283
this play and this wonderful company.

263
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.680
How many goodly creatures are there here?

264
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.740
How beauteous mankind is.

265
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.623
a brave new world that
has such people in it.

266
00:18:00.094 --> 00:18:01.134
Cheers.

267
00:18:01.134 --> 00:18:02.384
Cheers!

268
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.473
- Not bad.

269
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.460
Oh. fearless leader. not bad at all.

270
00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.070
Thank you. Hugh.

271
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.073
- Don't mention it.

272
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.860
- So how are you liking the
Hugh Painter experience?

273
00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.810
- I'm surviving it.

274
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.060
- He didn't like that you passed his test.

275
00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.520
- What the speech?

276
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.940
- He was trying to embarrass you.

277
00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.270
- He succeeded.

278
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.698
- Yeah. but not in the way he wanted to.

279
00:18:37.698 --> 00:18:38.598
You came off well.

280
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.500
Jess liked it.

281
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.333
- She's sweet.

282
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.433
- Uh. are these things working?

283
00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.030
Did you just come out of a bad breakup?

284
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.203
Celibate. gay?

285
00:18:52.249 --> 00:18:54.257
- I don't think so. why?

286
00:18:54.257 --> 00:18:58.340
- Because Jess is sweet. but
she's also freaking gorgeous.

287
00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.380
- I didn't say she wasn't.

288
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.440
- Oh. are you married?

289
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.197
- I think that question is
way beyond the boundaries.

290
00:19:03.197 --> 00:19:05.190
- Are you married?

291
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.720
- No. I'm not married.

292
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.850
I'm not in a relationship.

293
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.070
I'm not gay.

294
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:13.923
And Jess is gorgeous.
but I'm here to work.

295
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.110
And I think it's kind of sketchy

296
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.060
when directors hit on their actresses.

297
00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.077
- But if she hit on you?

298
00:19:20.077 --> 00:19:21.460
- You think she will?

299
00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.340
- So you'd be open to it?

300
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.040
- I didn't say--
- But would you?

301
00:19:25.463 --> 00:19:26.593
- You trying to set me up?

302
00:19:26.593 --> 00:19:29.120
- Yeah. why not?

303
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.557
I had a legendary romance up here.

304
00:19:30.557 --> 00:19:32.600
Why not you?
- Why not you?

305
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.982
- Oh. no. no. I'm too old for showmance.

306
00:19:35.982 --> 00:19:37.081
You are not too old.

307
00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:38.460
- Yes. I'm very old.

308
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.280
- What are you. 35?

309
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.294
- Charmer.

310
00:19:41.294 --> 00:19:43.297
- 29?
- Idiot.

311
00:19:43.297 --> 00:19:44.570
- A 112?
- Jackass.

312
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.420
- You're just mad I guessed it right.

313
00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:50.470
- Oh. you guys need drinks.

314
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.731
What are you having?

315
00:19:51.731 --> 00:19:53.810
- A beer would be great.

316
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:54.880
- Beer and a shot. you got it.

317
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.210
Sydney?

318
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:57.750
- I'll take a scotch.

319
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.903
- Good for you.

320
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.600
- I'll have a scotch.

321
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.000
- Seems appropriate.

322
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.150
- I like the way you drink.

323
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.470
- Thank you. kindly.

324
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.010
- Hey. no private parties. you guys.

325
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:11.843
Scoot over.

326
00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.630
What are we talking about?

327
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:16.730
- Oh. just gossip.

328
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.583
- Huh. no. that's boring.

329
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.720
Let's do a monologue off.

330
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.090
- Oof.
- I'll do a monologue.

331
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:25.400
You do a monologue.

332
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.400
And Adam will declare the winner.

333
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.430
- What are the criteria?

334
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:33.068
- Just fucking winning.

335
00:20:33.068 --> 00:20:34.401
- Oh. you're on.

336
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.910
- Oh freedom!

337
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.353
Sweet. sweet freedom!

338
00:20:41.703 --> 00:20:43.023
- I feel bad leaving Jess in there.

339
00:20:43.023 --> 00:20:45.524
She was only halfway through
the Queen Mab speech.

340
00:20:45.524 --> 00:20:47.140
- Oh no. she'll be fine. she's loving it.

341
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.890
He's still a big star to her.

342
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.040
- He's a big star to a lot of people.

343
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.270
- Yeah. I prefer the Brits.

344
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.080
- Any Brits in particular?

345
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.663
- Nope. just all of 'em.

346
00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.930
Hey. hey. you shouldn't
have made that speech

347
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:02.963
about the curse.

348
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:04.933
- Don't tell me you believe it.

349
00:21:04.933 --> 00:21:08.200
- No. no. I don't. but now
if anyone stubs their toe

350
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.410
or catches a cold. they'll blame you.

351
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.020
You tempted the God's.
people don't like that.

352
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.220
I think I'll take my chances.

353
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.750
- I admire your foolish courage.

354
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.057
Thank you.

355
00:21:19.057 --> 00:21:20.140
- No problem.

356
00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:22.923
I'm gonna climb this tree now.

357
00:21:24.558 --> 00:21:25.528
- You think that's wise?

358
00:21:25.528 --> 00:21:26.757
- No. I don't think it is.

359
00:21:26.757 --> 00:21:28.720
That's why I have to do it.

360
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.470
- Okay. just be careful. all right.

361
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.680
Your understudy's like 12.

362
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.980
I'm doing great.

363
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:40.923
- You think there are
any cops in this town?

364
00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.680
- Doubt it.

365
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.220
- Any authority figures of any kind?

366
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.370
- I guess it's just me.

367
00:22:02.494 --> 00:22:04.080
- Jesus Christ.

368
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.030
I'm okay.

369
00:22:05.878 --> 00:22:06.711
I'm okay.

370
00:22:06.711 --> 00:22:09.150
- Okay. you got to come down seriously.

371
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.550
It's not funny anymore.

372
00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.150
Okay. I'm coming down.

373
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.978
- He's climbing higher.

374
00:22:17.978 --> 00:22:20.200
- Yeah. I think so.

375
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.370
- All right. we're going to bed.

376
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.250
Goodnight. have fun with your tree.

377
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.653
Okay. goodnight.
I love you guys.

378
00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.070
- You think he's okay?

379
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.480
- Oh. he's fine.

380
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.410
He's not that drunk.

381
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.800
It's mostly just high spirits.

382
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.050
- So we're not bad people if we leave?

383
00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:36.883
- Come on.

384
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.210
- Hey. you know what occurred to me?

385
00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.043
- I don't.

386
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.160
- I didn't ask if you were married.

387
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.710
- Oh. I don't know if you should.

388
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.793
That might not be appropriate.

389
00:22:52.908 --> 00:22:54.107
- I feel like you're not.

390
00:22:54.107 --> 00:22:56.730
I feel like I would have heard about it.

391
00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.860
- You read a lot of People Magazine?

392
00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.323
- Well. yeah. in airports.

393
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.973
- I'm not married.

394
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.850
- Were you ever married?

395
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:07.683
- Never.

396
00:23:08.709 --> 00:23:11.170
At this point. I assume I won't be.

397
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:12.003
- Why is that?

398
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.783
- Oh. it's a young person's game.

399
00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.050
Most of my friends are already divorced.

400
00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:20.665
I don't think that
puts them ahead of you.

401
00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:22.030
It depends
on how you look at it.

402
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.090
Well. how do you look at it?

403
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:25.423
Depends on the day.

404
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.410
- How old are you anyway?

405
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.730
- Now. that would be telling.

406
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:38.120
Hey. I know this is
none of my business. but--

407
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.773
- Oh. I love where this is going.

408
00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:42.862
Are you happy?

409
00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.040
- Uh.

410
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.550
I'm not unhappy.

411
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.670
- Yeah. but what are you looking for?

412
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.520
What do you want?

413
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:56.923
- If I knew that Adam.

414
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:59.443
if I knew that.

415
00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.060
- I'm gonna go check on Lucas.

416
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.893
I feel bad.

417
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.110
- He's fine. Adam.

418
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.663
- I know. I'm just gonna check on him.

419
00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:19.973
- All right.

420
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.930
Well. get some rest.

421
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:24.763
- You too.

422
00:24:25.817 --> 00:24:27.243
It's a big day tomorrow.

423
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.747
- They're all big days.

424
00:24:30.747 --> 00:24:32.164
Exactly.

425
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.529
- Are you all right?

426
00:26:22.529 --> 00:26:25.403
- I. I am well.

427
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.723
Yet stranger time than
strange is this I see.

428
00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.510
More curious lands and less
familiar people than ever

429
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.593
I did think to look upon.

430
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.500
- You're not from around here then?

431
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.203
- In faith. I know not where I am.

432
00:26:45.609 --> 00:26:47.710
Nor cannot tell being ignorant of that

433
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:52.710
how far. how close my
birth land maybe found.

434
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:57.430
If I must judge the
thing by raw appearance.

435
00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:02.343
I am as distant from my
home as fish from heaven.

436
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:07.063
soaring birds from the
black belly of the sea.

437
00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.263
And yet it is green here.

438
00:27:13.938 --> 00:27:15.953
And the birds sing much the same.

439
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.990
And all the land unfolds in pleasant hills

440
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.963
much as in other times I've seen.

441
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.300
Methinks it's chiefly men that change

442
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.500
while nature. being no coy
strumpet nor no flattering maid

443
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.270
keeps constant in her
heart that rare devotion

444
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.253
that virtuous widows may aspire to show.

445
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.700
- What art though?

446
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.563
How come so hither. man?

447
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.993
- My words. you speak my words.

448
00:27:49.993 --> 00:27:51.860
- I speak what words I'm given.

449
00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:52.930
I am a player.

450
00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:54.900
- And so was I.

451
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.633
When time was mine to spend.

452
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.380
I trod the boards of every princely stage

453
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.140
and many coarser ones in muddy towns.

454
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.630
Hey awry.

455
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.500
It was such a game to play

456
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.303
as might have tempted very
gods to join in blessed times.

457
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.047
It is now long past. long gone.

458
00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.633
My time is gone.

459
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.723
- You speak too sadly for a man so young.

460
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:30.170
- Is sadness the monopoly of years?

461
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:33.323
May only dotards know her sour sweet kiss.

462
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.510
But I am not. perhaps. as young

463
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.993
as you kind lady that
you are would have me be.

464
00:28:41.894 --> 00:28:43.800
What year is it?

465
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.070
- You mock me. sir.

466
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.990
- Why no such thing.

467
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:48.470
You do me wrong to say it.

468
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:52.530
Shall I mock the seat of such
a regal beauty as yours is?

469
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.760
- And now you flatter.

470
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.160
- You mistake again.

471
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.830
Such words as would be flattery if untrue.

472
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:03.130
when true are only sense.
I spoke my thought.

473
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.030
- You are the strangest creature that ever

474
00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.693
I have chanced to look upon.

475
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.950
- I'll call that gracious.

476
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:13.670
for what's strange is bright.

477
00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.080
It stands against the dullness

478
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.800
of the same like diamonds
gleaming in a pig sty.

479
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.260
I'll be strange.

480
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.650
If strange. be pleasing to you.

481
00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:27.640
let me be as plain.
uncanny as a sow with wings

482
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.150
or as a fish that breaks
the prison of the sea

483
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:34.160
and stepping onto land turns. bod.

484
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.590
or blacksmith or what trade you will.

485
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.823
- You are as strange to me as all of that.

486
00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:46.000
And if you are what I have think you are.

487
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.120
you're even stranger. but it cannot be it.

488
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.310
- Yet say it. lady.

489
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.383
- I am loath to speak.

490
00:29:51.383 --> 00:29:52.793
- Then I'll speak for you.

491
00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.980
You have guessed my name. my nature

492
00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.300
and the place from whence I come.

493
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.970
You call impossible the thing you see

494
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.820
and. therefore. doubt
your eyes. your brain

495
00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.413
and every organ that gives man his sense.

496
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.933
And yet is true.

497
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.300
I stand before you now.

498
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.250
If you interrogate your secrets so.

499
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.813
you'll see you credit me in spite of all.

500
00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.210
What year is it?

501
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.860
- 2019.

502
00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:29.810
- Oh!

503
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:30.643
2019!

504
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:39.060
Oh. brave humanity that
leaps through centuries

505
00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.770
with heedless bounds.

506
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:43.880
That I should live to see so late a day

507
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.980
and that the race of
man should still abide.

508
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.220
Though time and all her
ravages had set their teeth

509
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:56.220
into its tenuous walls.
great is my heart with praise

510
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.143
for all mankind.

511
00:30:58.143 --> 00:31:02.030
That all our flags and
banners blend as one

512
00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.773
and let us march on to posterity
one arm linked in another.

513
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:08.643
praise to man.

514
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.823
- What's the last thing you remember?

515
00:31:14.463 --> 00:31:17.110
- A dream. a merest dream.

516
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.130
I dreamed that down the centuries.

517
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:24.130
my plays had strutted forth
to flaunt their gaudy trim

518
00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.070
and pale scholars stooping over books

519
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.697
had argued this or that
to preen their brains.

520
00:31:30.697 --> 00:31:35.697
All this I saw. but saw
without belief for I was dead

521
00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.080
and thought the afterlife
must be this mute parade

522
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.663
of living hopes. sweet
delirium of a mortal thing.

523
00:31:45.663 --> 00:31:47.780
- 'Tis true enough.

524
00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.520
Your name is so revered

525
00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.263
no other writer can come
close to touching it.

526
00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.003
- 'Tis wondrous strange.

527
00:31:58.319 --> 00:32:01.820
'Tis well desired. but is ill-deserved.

528
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.170
What then of Marlowe or of Johnson too?

529
00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.003
They were my betters.

530
00:32:05.003 --> 00:32:06.170
Have they not their fame?

531
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:07.423
- Nothing like yours.

532
00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:14.650
- It is a heathen world. a fallen place

533
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:19.033
where chance and sin weigh
more than reason and devotion.

534
00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.373
Yet I'll not be grave.

535
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:24.950
I am remembered.

536
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:26.583
I strove not in vain.

537
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.260
What play is it you play in here and now?

538
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.810
- I play Lady Macbeth.

539
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.980
- An excellent throne.

540
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.730
Yet a peculiar play.

541
00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.028
What think you of this?

542
00:32:38.028 --> 00:32:40.060
- It's a challenge. yes.

543
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:43.660
- A challenge. aye. that's admirably said.

544
00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.700
The play will seek to strive with you

545
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.960
which one may be the better end

546
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.257
with weapons drawn yourself

547
00:32:49.257 --> 00:32:53.640
and it shall fearsomely
contend. yet shrink not lady.

548
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.290
If you win the day. the
spoils are such glory

549
00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:00.483
as the mind must reel to contemplate.

550
00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.270
And who's your King?

551
00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.790
- A knave. I fear.

552
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.500
- Yet that's all one.

553
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.163
A knave may speak as
fairly as an honest man.

554
00:33:09.163 --> 00:33:12.410
Let him not mumble. let his voice be keen.

555
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.090
his carriage noble

556
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.570
and I'll call the man the
knave of all my heart.

557
00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.100
When do you play?

558
00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.860
- Two weeks from Friday.

559
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.113
- That's time enough.

560
00:33:25.312 --> 00:33:26.233
Who knows?

561
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:31.380
But I may find some little
uses for myself in counseling

562
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.960
which way the play must
bend to give its arrows

563
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.570
their most worthy flight.

564
00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:40.773
For now. fair playeress. I take my leave.

565
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.493
This mist must claim
me. for myself I mist.

566
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.223
no more corporeal than are men's dreams.

567
00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.790
Goodnight. dear lady. when we meet again.

568
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.990
we'll talk more to the purpose.

569
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.883
Till that time. farewell.

570
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.270
- So this is all playable space.

571
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:18.320
- Yeah. all playable.

572
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:22.060
That step is high. though.
so just keep that in mind.

573
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.960
- Okay. good.

574
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.150
It looks. it looks great.

575
00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.290
I just wanted to make sure
that I had it in my head.

576
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:28.790
- Yeah. no problem.
- Thanks.

577
00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:32.603
- Morning. Adam

578
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.970
- You look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

579
00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:38.610
- I just had a run. I feel great.

580
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.160
Where do you get
all of this energy from?

581
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.200
- Oh. I borrow it from
my future elderly self.

582
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.280
She doesn't mind?

583
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.113
- Who cares?

584
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:49.783
- Am I late?

585
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:53.650
- You. sir. are early.

586
00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:54.513
- Ah. shit.

587
00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.220
- You missed my Mercutio.

588
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.230
You mean in 1978?

589
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:03.120
- Ah. that's funny.

590
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.620
No. you're very funny.

591
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.360
Isn't he very funny?

592
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.193
- Very.

593
00:35:12.418 --> 00:35:13.743
Hey.

594
00:35:13.743 --> 00:35:15.535
Hey.

595
00:35:15.535 --> 00:35:16.368
You all right?

596
00:35:16.368 --> 00:35:17.990
You look a little done in.

597
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.823
Yeah. I'm fine.

598
00:35:18.823 --> 00:35:20.123
I just didn't sleep well.

599
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:22.303
- Funny dreams?

600
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.713
You know. I
don't think it was a dream.

601
00:35:27.873 --> 00:35:29.463
but it was definitely funny.

602
00:35:30.542 --> 00:35:32.197
You want to talk about it?

603
00:35:32.197 --> 00:35:34.780
- Um. I met someone last night.

604
00:35:37.001 --> 00:35:37.865
A man.

605
00:35:37.865 --> 00:35:38.914
- That was fast.

606
00:35:38.914 --> 00:35:39.997
- No. listen.

607
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.090
He was sitting on a bench

608
00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:46.663
in the moonlight and he claimed to be.

609
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:51.300
no. he didn't actually
claim to be anything.

610
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:56.233
but he seemed like. he
acted like Shakespeare.

611
00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.013
- So he was a lunatic?

612
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:01.920
- Maybe.

613
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.090
But nah. he didn't strike me as that.

614
00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:09.090
He struck me as. not from here.

615
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.348
- A foreign lunatic?

616
00:36:11.348 --> 00:36:12.359
- Well. you let me tell the story?

617
00:36:12.359 --> 00:36:13.940
- I'm sorry.

618
00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:16.680
- So he was sitting on that bench

619
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.350
in the back garden and he was
playing some sort of flute.

620
00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.900
We had this incredible conversation.

621
00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.200
He said he would hang around

622
00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.534
and help out with our production.

623
00:36:26.534 --> 00:36:30.323
And then he kind of melted
away into the darkness.

624
00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.710
- You having any other symptoms?

625
00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.600
- Okay. he didn't melt away.

626
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:42.600
He walked away. but there
was a melting quality to it.

627
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.070
- Well. I would appreciate his help.

628
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:47.903
- You're doing fine.

629
00:36:47.903 --> 00:36:50.830
- Well. I know. I know I'm doing fine.

630
00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:52.280
I wouldn't mind doing better.

631
00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:55.130
- If I see Shakespeare again.

632
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.550
I will invite him to rehearsal.

633
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.580
Thank you. just
don't tell the company.

634
00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.623
I think it might make
'em a little nervous.

635
00:37:00.623 --> 00:37:02.433
- I can't imagine why.

636
00:37:02.433 --> 00:37:05.093
- All right. let's get started everyone.

637
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:09.660
- All right. can we take it
from lady M's entrance. please?

638
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.300
And Syd. could you find his eye line

639
00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.280
just a little bit sooner

640
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.040
so we don't have that
pause before how now?

641
00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.130
- Got it.
- Thank you.

642
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:18.780
All right. whenever you're ready.

643
00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.650
- Lauren. can you give me
the starter line please?

644
00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.737
- I have no spirit.
- Thank you. got it.

645
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.700
- I have no spirit to prick
the sides of mine intent

646
00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.350
but only vaulting ambition.

647
00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:31.560
which all leaps itself and falls on the...

648
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.560
How now. what news?

649
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.520
- He has almost supped.

650
00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.750
Why have you left the chamber?

651
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:35.800
- Hath he asked for me?

652
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.023
- No you not he has.

653
00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:43.410
- We will proceed no
further in this business.

654
00:37:44.261 --> 00:37:45.830
He hath honored me of late.

655
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:48.810
and I have bought golden opinions
from all sorts of people.

656
00:37:49.643 --> 00:37:50.743
Jesus Christ!

657
00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.530
- Is everyone all right?

658
00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:57.850
- I'm fine.

659
00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:59.300
I'm fine. Jesus Christ.

660
00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.370
- Sydney. you okay?

661
00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:01.833
- Uh. yes. yes.

662
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.583
- Okay. well. that's not good.

663
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.130
I'll call maintenance.

664
00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:15.963
- Good idea.

665
00:38:18.579 --> 00:38:21.450
- It was a chunk of stone
bigger than my head.

666
00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:22.510
It was sizeable.

667
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:24.520
I could hear it whistle
as it came down by my ear.

668
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.680
I could feel the wind on my face.

669
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.540
It almost gave me a
shave. it was that close.

670
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.730
And when it hit the floor.
there was this resounding thunk.

671
00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:37.393
I could feel the whole stage
vibrate like an earthquake.

672
00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.976
I swear I could feel my teeth rattle.

673
00:38:40.976 --> 00:38:43.440
It hit with that much force.

674
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.600
- You must have been scared witless?

675
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.840
- I don't mind telling you that I was.

676
00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.300
My heart was in my mouth.

677
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.960
I stopped breathing.

678
00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.860
I knew what it was that had
missed me by a hair's breadth.

679
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:55.653
There was death.

680
00:38:58.046 --> 00:39:02.141
- Well. I'm just glad nobody was hurt.

681
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:04.810
- So am I. so am I.

682
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:09.280
You know. in a way. I'm
glad that it happened to me.

683
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.610
If it had happened to one
of the younger cast members.

684
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.850
it might have scared them
out of the business for life.

685
00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:16.580
- I admire your courage. Hugh.

686
00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.940
- It's not courage.

687
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.370
It's pure cussedness.

688
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:21.470
They're gonna have to carry me

689
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.270
out of that theater on a stretcher.

690
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.161
And even then I'll be reciting
King Lear as I go out.

691
00:39:29.435 --> 00:39:32.790
- So what do you think.
you think I was was wrong

692
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:34.140
to make light of the curse?

693
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.150
- Let the witches bring it on. my friend.

694
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.570
Let them bring it on.

695
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.256
- Mr. Shakespeare?

696
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.573
Mr. Shakespeare?

697
00:40:23.492 --> 00:40:24.325
Will?

698
00:40:25.461 --> 00:40:27.920
- What silkened throated
nymph calls to me now?

699
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.363
What voice too tender
for this too harsh world?

700
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.290
It is the lady I beheld last night

701
00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.810
whose image never since has quit mine eye.

702
00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.940
but lingers there impervious today

703
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.230
in all the coarser sights
the day thrusts on.

704
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:47.660
Why so pale. my lady?

705
00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.840
Why so wild of eye?

706
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.440
Faith. anyone would
think you'd seen a ghost.

707
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.130
- Something's happened.

708
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.600
- I can guess it well.

709
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.520
But what has chanced and
why it frights you so.

710
00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.440
I do confess beyond my skill to know.

711
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.950
- You weren't at the theater?

712
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:07.410
- I wonder as I told you here and yon

713
00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:10.490
in insubstantial shadows till you call.

714
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:13.190
- A piece of ceiling fell onto the stage.

715
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:15.790
inches from Hugh. it almost killed him.

716
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.450
- Is Hugh a player?

717
00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:19.583
- Yes. a very good one.

718
00:41:19.583 --> 00:41:22.480
- Then it is not well. a
play must well be played.

719
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.990
Is he sore wounded?

720
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.580
Does he speak or see?

721
00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.530
- He's all right. but it was a close call.

722
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.770
- It is no matter then.
what's well is well.

723
00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:33.740
To escape the lion by a hair's breadth

724
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.890
is as good as never entering the den.

725
00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.700
- Uh. I don't take it so lightly.

726
00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:43.000
- So I see. but you are female

727
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.100
and of such stuff made that
like the strings of lutes

728
00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:51.410
when tensely strung. you
vibrate at the touch.

729
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.580
- That's not the point.

730
00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:57.570
And besides we don't
think that way anymore.

731
00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:59.140
- What way is that?

732
00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:02.630
- That women are so
delicate and sensitive.

733
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:07.630
It's not. well. it turns
out not to be true.

734
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.860
- Faith. you amaze me.

735
00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:13.283
- Yeah. well. sorry.

736
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.580
- I did think you had a sort of manliness

737
00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.350
about you too. a vigor and a willfulness.

738
00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:25.780
perhaps. not wholly
female that became you.

739
00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:30.780
Well. man's courage in a
graceful female shape 'tis odd.

740
00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.830
'Tis wondrous odd. provoking odd.

741
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:37.910
and I'll begrudge it
not. it moves me quite.

742
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.300
- You knew women like this.

743
00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.923
I know you did. I've read your plays.

744
00:42:42.923 --> 00:42:45.400
- Nay. you speak true.

745
00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.940
And if the world now stands
as peopled with such creatures

746
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:54.940
as the sea is dense with
teeming fish. I like it well.

747
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.797
All women queens and all queens worthy.

748
00:42:57.797 --> 00:42:59.630
that is no mean world.

749
00:43:01.251 --> 00:43:02.084
- Well. you know. we're working on it.

750
00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:07.110
- But I digress as I am won't to do.

751
00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.340
Methinks you had a purpose coming here

752
00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.930
which I have less than answered.

753
00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:11.763
Speak your mind.

754
00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.803
- Is there a curse on Macbeth?

755
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.410
It's been a theater legend for centuries.

756
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:25.700
The play was cursed by witches.

757
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.850
I never believed it.

758
00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:28.693
Is it true?

759
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.903
- There is something in it.

760
00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.113
- Can you tell me why?

761
00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:46.070
- I knew a witch

762
00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.823
when I was very young.

763
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.220
She came to live in Stratford

764
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.690
and her house was very near my father's.

765
00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.780
We became. I'll not say friends.

766
00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.780
for time proved otherwise.
but such acquaintances

767
00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.610
as might find time to wander
by the river side by side

768
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:10.610
and talk of slight and
unremembered things.

769
00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:13.770
One day. my father learned of this

770
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:18.770
and swore I should be banished
from his house for life.

771
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.363
if I broke not my concourse with a witch.

772
00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.870
This thing I did. for I was young. unripe.

773
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:31.853
and very fearful of my father's wrath.

774
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:38.350
Some 12 years later in a London street.

775
00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:39.510
we chanced to meet again.

776
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:43.230
and being now some ways toward manhood.

777
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:48.190
I now saw the witch in
such a different light

778
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:52.730
that we became. I'll not say lovers.

779
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.770
for it was not love.

780
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:59.770
but something that was
more and less than friends.

781
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.510
From her. I drew the secrets of Macbeth.

782
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:07.670
the rites the witches
do perform and speak.

783
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.810
And when at last the play became itself

784
00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:11.240
and went before the public.

785
00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:16.240
she was wrought into
such fury at my impudence

786
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:20.770
that much I fear she did contrive a spell

787
00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:24.390
to turn its fortunes into curdled fears

788
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:27.579
and all its glory to such sour laments

789
00:45:27.579 --> 00:45:30.933
that after times would
speak its name with scorn.

790
00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.003
This came to pass.

791
00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:42.400
And now my pretty play
like some fair maiden

792
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.350
stunted in her youth is left
to hobble after happiness

793
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:50.830
while other lesser but more blessed things

794
00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:52.983
trip gaily to their joy.

795
00:45:54.792 --> 00:45:55.873
'Tis hard.

796
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.020
'Tis hard.

797
00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:02.890
- But the play's enormously popular.

798
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:04.610
What kind of curse is that?

799
00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:06.270
'Tis infamy. not fame.

800
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.460
The players loved for bringing
on disaster. not delight.

801
00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.490
- I think you're wrong.

802
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:12.600
- Well. we'll not argue it.

803
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.610
What's done is done.

804
00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:17.260
Or so the saying goes. what
may be done. man wonders

805
00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.733
and God knows.

806
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.513
- Is there a way to lift the curse?

807
00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.920
I'd rather not get crushed by bricks.

808
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.770
if I can help it.

809
00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:31.873
- I'll ponder it.

810
00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.313
And now I'll say good night.

811
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:40.623
Playing truth may come to
view with dawn's plain light.

812
00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.540
- Okay. everybody. if I
could have your attention.

813
00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.630
We have had the roof
thoroughly checked out

814
00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:00.780
and there is no sign of
any structural problem

815
00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.450
or any more loose masonry.

816
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:04.260
Obviously. safety is our first priority.

817
00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:07.340
If you feel uncomfortable
or unsafe at any point.

818
00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.610
please come to me and we'll work it out.

819
00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:11.100
Okay?

820
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.330
Okay. Adam. stage is yours.

821
00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:14.510
- Thank you.

822
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:17.400
Why don't we pick up where
we left off yesterday?

823
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.963
Can I get Hugh and Sydney
up on the stage please?

824
00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:25.573
- You all right?

825
00:47:25.573 --> 00:47:28.250
- Yeah. yeah. just tired.

826
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:29.800
- Had trouble sleeping?

827
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.870
- A little.

828
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:33.420
- Oh. what you need is
a good bedtime ritual.

829
00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:34.830
It works wonders.

830
00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:38.270
- Oh. do you have any suggestions?

831
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:39.650
- I have a few thoughts.

832
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:42.830
- Okay. can we go from the
top of the soliloquy please?

833
00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:43.700
- We'll talk later.

834
00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:44.883
- Oh. I have no doubt.

835
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:50.550
- If it were done when
'tis done. then 'twere well

836
00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:52.400
it were done quickly.

837
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.220
If the assassination could
trammel up the consequence.

838
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:58.203
with his surcease.

839
00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:01.780
- You okay. Hugh?

840
00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:02.923
- I'm fine. fine.

841
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.300
And catch with his surcease.

842
00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.280
Can we get him some water?

843
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.980
No. hot tea.

844
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.370
With honey.

845
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:10.318
And whiskey.

846
00:48:10.318 --> 00:48:11.151
- Do we have whiskey?

847
00:48:11.151 --> 00:48:11.984
I'll make it happen.

848
00:48:11.984 --> 00:48:12.970
- Thank you.

849
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:13.870
- Sorry. everyone.

850
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.190
Too late a night of it. I guess.

851
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:18.230
- That's all right. Hugh.

852
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:19.083
Come take a seat.

853
00:48:20.367 --> 00:48:21.200
- Yeah.

854
00:48:22.276 --> 00:48:23.109
Yeah. okay.

855
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:26.240
Sorry.

856
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.020
- Can we. do we have the porter?

857
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:30.720
- Tom's not called till afternoon.

858
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.650
- Well. Lucas. are you memorized
for act four. scene three.

859
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:35.060
- I think so. mostly.

860
00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:35.893
Sean?

861
00:48:35.893 --> 00:48:36.910
- Born for it.

862
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:39.420
- Great. let's get 43 up on its feet.

863
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:40.970
And you can have book in hand

864
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:42.270
if it makes you more comfortable.

865
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:43.180
- No. I'll risk it.

866
00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.013
- Good man.

867
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.113
Sorry. Syd.

868
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:49.890
- No. no. I'm just worried about Hugh.

869
00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:50.723
- Oh. he's fine.

870
00:48:50.723 --> 00:48:53.223
He's just partying a little too hard.

871
00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.497
- You think that's it?

872
00:48:57.543 --> 00:48:58.543
- Yeah. why?

873
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.393
- No reason.

874
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:02.323
Do your job.

875
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:06.663
- All right guys. whenever you're ready.

876
00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:12.400
- If such a one be fit to govern. speak.

877
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.720
I am as I have spoken.

878
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.130
- Fit to govern. no. not to live.

879
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:20.830
Oh. nation miserable
with an untitled tyrant.

880
00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:23.450
bloody-sceptered. when will thou see

881
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:25.710
thy wholesome days again.

882
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:27.550
Since that the truest issue of thy throne

883
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:29.920
by his own interdiction stands accursed

884
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.073
and does blaspheme his breed?

885
00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:35.327
Thy royal father was a most sainted king.

886
00:49:35.327 --> 00:49:36.826
- This is not a good play.

887
00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.203
No. I'm sorry. but it's not.

888
00:49:40.203 --> 00:49:41.603
It's too unfocused.

889
00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.260
And whose play is it anyway?

890
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.930
It's not Macbeth's.

891
00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:49.067
I mean. he disappears
for long stretches of it

892
00:49:49.067 --> 00:49:51.570
and he hardly ever
really drives the action.

893
00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:52.770
It's not Lady Macbeth.

894
00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:55.803
She goes to pieces a full
act before the climax.

895
00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:59.183
I guess it's Macduff's play. really.

896
00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:02.323
Maybe Malcolm's?

897
00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:05.430
But are they two distinct characters

898
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.003
or just virtuous blanks?

899
00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:10.880
Sorry. it's a mess.

900
00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:14.983
It's a mess with with some
beautiful language. but still.

901
00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.960
- You shouldn't say things like that.

902
00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.270
- Why not. it's true.

903
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:21.103
- It doesn't matter.

904
00:50:21.103 --> 00:50:22.243
You just shouldn't say it.

905
00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:25.430
- Why?

906
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:26.630
- Because it's bad luck.

907
00:50:29.554 --> 00:50:30.387
- Well.

908
00:50:44.079 --> 00:50:46.735
Listen. I
said you could tag along

909
00:50:46.735 --> 00:50:49.040
to research your book.

910
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.008
But you gotta follow my lead.

911
00:50:51.008 --> 00:50:52.758
Let's keep it simple.

912
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:57.182
I hear you. Snowman.

913
00:51:11.659 --> 00:51:12.492
- Will!

914
00:51:15.973 --> 00:51:16.806
Will!

915
00:51:20.934 --> 00:51:21.767
Will!

916
00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.760
Holy shit!

917
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.920
- Be calm. good lady.

918
00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.050
Women are as men in this late time

919
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.260
as you know passing well.

920
00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.110
Therefore. no matter if I do intrude.

921
00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:09.260
we are two men in
conference. nothing more.

922
00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:11.080
- It's not your gender that worries me.

923
00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.290
It's that you're in my goddamned room.

924
00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:15.450
- 'Tis not damned that I can see.

925
00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:19.870
I think it is as fine a room
as might be wished and blessed

926
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:22.180
moreover by your body's grace

927
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:25.283
and all your sweet possessions.

928
00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:27.163
Excellent room.

929
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.380
- Why are you here?

930
00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.220
- A smallest reason.

931
00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:37.220
I have pages here which will.
when folded into my main text.

932
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:41.240
mend somewhat of the clumsiness that mars

933
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:44.090
the otherwise fine surface of the play.

934
00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:45.330
I'll leave them here with you.

935
00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:48.990
And when you think it meet
deliver them unto your manager.

936
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:52.840
He'll see their worth
at once. if he be wise.

937
00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:56.050
If not come find me and I'll make him see.

938
00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:57.900
- We're two weeks from performance.

939
00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.290
- Aye. there's time.

940
00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:02.550
A week's a year when
stage work is in hand.

941
00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:04.010
- Will. I don't think I can do this.

942
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:05.180
- Nay. you can.

943
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.460
It is well within your
power and your rights.

944
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.650
- Why don't you take it to Adam yourself?

945
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:12.190
- You are my anchor in this tainted world.

946
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:13.370
The fates have willed it so.

947
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:14.723
I know not why.

948
00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:21.863
- Why do you speak in verse?

949
00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:23.843
- I beg your pardon.

950
00:53:23.843 --> 00:53:24.890
What mean you by that?

951
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:27.288
- That. that is what I mean.

952
00:53:27.288 --> 00:53:29.210
Iambic pentameter.

953
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:31.940
You talk like a character
in one of your plays.

954
00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.570
but that doesn't make any sense.

955
00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:37.250
No one spoke that way
in Elizabethan England.

956
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:39.450
It was a convention of the stage.

957
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.351
That's not how people talked.

958
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:47.280
- When you have had
four centuries to muse.

959
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:50.440
to pine. to wallow in the sainted word.

960
00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:53.100
you'll find the music of the speech

961
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:57.943
you dreamed contains a substance
that it lacked in life.

962
00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:02.610
I speak as I have always wished to speak

963
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:07.610
with bright precision
and with chosen grace.

964
00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.520
- So it's not because you're a genius.

965
00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.070
It's because you're a ghost.

966
00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:13.470
- Can not one man be both?

967
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:14.853
You are unkind.

968
00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.980
- Will. listen to me.

969
00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.630
- Upon my honor. where we not both men.

970
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:24.980
I might make free with
certain choice remarks

971
00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.080
regarding these your garments

972
00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:32.010
and the shapes that they too
thickly veil to briefly show.

973
00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:33.750
- Don't be a pig.

974
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:36.020
- Admiration is nothing bestial.

975
00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:39.480
Why. heaven herself doth
grant man's poor eye

976
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.980
the wisdom to discern a fairer grace.

977
00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:42.813
- Will!

978
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:47.010
- I cry your mercy. lady.

979
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:48.053
What's your will?

980
00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:55.290
- I asked you if you could lift the curse.

981
00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:58.600
- And I have thought upon it.

982
00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.560
This poor sheath. imperfect as it is.

983
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:06.560
may make some change upon the
workings of this damned play

984
00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:09.470
that yields a better music to the ear

985
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:12.993
of that coarse witch
whose anger hexed it so.

986
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:15.930
- That isn't what you
said two minutes ago.

987
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:16.960
- And you must pardon me.

988
00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.790
I clean forgot amid the
rash excitement of my art

989
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:24.140
that all my skill this
time has been to save you

990
00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:27.920
and your fellows from this ancient blight.

991
00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.910
- I don't believe you.

992
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:31.170
This is just that thing where playwrights

993
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:32.890
tinker with a piece that's done.

994
00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:35.310
- I'll not deny that vice has been my own.

995
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:39.300
but if my name's as sacred as you claim

996
00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:41.910
would not your manager and all your troop

997
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:45.200
show plain delight that
I should tinker thus.

998
00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.010
- They won't believe it.

999
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.410
I have not myself.

1000
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:51.433
- You doubt me still.

1001
00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:54.623
Then I must furnish proof.

1002
00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:01.560
When last we met. I said my
time was spent in dismal shadows

1003
00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:06.560
in mute veils of gray. but as
your image flourishes in me

1004
00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.620
and blooms full colored in my secret.

1005
00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:14.490
so I find my world and my gray body too

1006
00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:18.773
grow clear and solid
as the things of life.

1007
00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:22.023
Come touch me.

1008
00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:26.060
I am no pale shade. no trembling spirit.

1009
00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:29.100
but a sinewed man.

1010
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:32.300
You have made me thus
by calling me from sleep

1011
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:35.870
with your bewitching presence

1012
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:39.513
and your kind yet all too stubborn heart.

1013
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:45.510
Now. touch my face and see what flesh

1014
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:47.183
your grace has made of me.

1015
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:11.420
- This proves the opposite
of what you claim.

1016
00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.550
You can't be Shakespeare
and be flesh and blood.

1017
00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:15.700
Will. Shakespeare died 400 years ago.

1018
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.840
- Yet Shakespeare stands before you.

1019
00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:22.120
Call it strange. call it
uncanny and impossible.

1020
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.663
Yet 'tis the truth.

1021
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:28.543
And in your truest heart. you
know me to be truly what I am.

1022
00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:38.170
Will you these words deliver to your troop

1023
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:41.310
that my unlucky play may have some hope

1024
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:44.143
of overcoming its long years of shame?

1025
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:47.593
- I will.

1026
00:57:49.112 --> 00:57:50.713
- For this. I humbly thank you.

1027
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:57.563
Now. it is time for me to
melt away in shadows dark.

1028
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.860
If still you doubt that I am magic made

1029
00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:07.520
by magic summoned and made palpable.

1030
00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:12.070
observe this wall and
how this human flesh.

1031
00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:13.740
which not long since you touched.

1032
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:18.660
considers it as slighter thing as dreams

1033
00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:23.660
or wishes vain or men when
they are dead or heart or life.

1034
00:58:29.026 --> 00:58:29.859
- Oh!

1035
00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:16.030
- The sun is high and I am up.

1036
00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:21.030
Is coffee brewed for I do crave a cup.

1037
00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:22.640
- It sounds like you have your voice back.

1038
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.430
- Oh. sound as a bell. sound as a bell.

1039
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:27.330
All I really needed was
a good night's rest.

1040
00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:30.820
So I guess you won't have to
do "Macbeth" without Macbeth.

1041
00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:32.340
I had a backup plan.

1042
00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:33.240
- Oh really. what was it?

1043
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.610
- Kenneth Branagh.

1044
00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:35.443
- Liar.

1045
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.423
- Uh. Adam. can I talk
to you for a second?

1046
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.380
- Sure. of course.

1047
00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:46.120
- Actor secrets or Sydney secrets?

1048
00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.930
- Mind your business. Hugh.

1049
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:49.280
- It's never worked for me.

1050
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:59.350
- Okay. remember how I told
you about meeting Shakespeare?

1051
00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:00.420
- You said you've met someone

1052
01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:02.570
who claimed to be.
- Adam. it's him.

1053
01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:06.003
- I know it's crazy. but it's
him. and he gave me something.

1054
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.940
- What is this?

1055
01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:10.890
- It's a rewrite.

1056
01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:11.723
- A rewrite of what?

1057
01:00:11.723 --> 01:00:12.556
- "Macbeth".

1058
01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.157
- Okay. now you actually
have me concerned.

1059
01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:24.130
- Okay. I'll tell you what. you read that

1060
01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:25.360
and then you come and tell me

1061
01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:28.260
this was not written
by William Shakespeare.

1062
01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.210
- I don't have time to read that.

1063
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:31.103
- Are you kidding me?
- Okay. okay.

1064
01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.190
Okay. so I will read this.

1065
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.330
Yes.

1066
01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:40.460
- And then I will come find you.

1067
01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.570
- Yes.
- Okay.

1068
01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:42.403
- Okay.

1069
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:44.323
- Anything else?

1070
01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.713
- I'd kill for some breakfast.

1071
01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:50.723
- Well. you might have to the way

1072
01:00:50.723 --> 01:00:52.213
that Hugh was piling it on.

1073
01:01:02.385 --> 01:01:07.290
- Prithee. peace. I dare do
all that may become a man

1074
01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:09.290
who dares do more is none.

1075
01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:10.570
- What beast was't. then.

1076
01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:13.150
that made you break this enterprise to me?

1077
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:16.290
When you durst do it. then you were a man

1078
01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:17.830
and to be more than what you were.

1079
01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:20.563
you would be so much more the man.

1080
01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:23.860
Nor time nor place did then adhere.

1081
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.493
and yet you would make both.

1082
01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:29.360
They have made themselves.
and that their fitness now

1083
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.763
does unmake you.

1084
01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:36.410
I have given suck. and know how tender

1085
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:39.233
'tis to love the babe that milks me.

1086
01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:44.250
I would. when it was smiling in my face.

1087
01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:47.160
have plucked my nipple
from his boneless gums

1088
01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.200
and dashed the brains
out. had I so sworn as you

1089
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.811
have done to this.

1090
01:01:51.811 --> 01:01:52.960
- If we should fail?

1091
01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.003
- We fail?

1092
01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.960
But screw your courage
to the sticking-place.

1093
01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.953
and we'll not fail.

1094
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:04.640
When Duncan is asleep.
whereto the rather shall

1095
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.690
his day's hard journey soundly invite him.

1096
01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:10.520
his two chamberlains will I with wine

1097
01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.860
and while so convince that memory.

1098
01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:13.800
the warder of the brain.

1099
01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.060
shall be a fume. and the receipt of reason

1100
01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:22.700
a limbeck only. when in swinish sleep

1101
01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.600
their drenched natures lie as in a death.

1102
01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.760
What cannot you and I perform upon

1103
01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.090
the unguarded Duncan?

1104
01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:33.090
What not put upon his spongy officers.

1105
01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:37.233
who shall bear the guilt
of our great quell?

1106
01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.473
- Bring forth men-children only.

1107
01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:45.993
for thy undaunted mettle should
compose nothing but males.

1108
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:53.260
Will it not be received.

1109
01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.670
when we have marked with
blood those sleepy two

1110
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:59.330
of his own chamber and
used their very daggers.

1111
01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:00.520
That they have done 't?

1112
01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.500
- Who dares receive it other.

1113
01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:06.930
as we shall make our griefs
and clamor roar upon his death?

1114
01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:10.650
- I am settled. and bend
up each corporal agent

1115
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:11.833
to this terrible feat.

1116
01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:18.210
Away. and mock the time with fairest show.

1117
01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:22.063
False face must hide what
the false heart doth know.

1118
01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:32.390
- Yes. yes!

1119
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:34.523
Now. that is some goddamned Shakespeare!

1120
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.840
Beautiful. guys. it's
just really beautiful.

1121
01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.253
How's it feel?

1122
01:03:39.253 --> 01:03:40.710
- Uh. it's getting there?

1123
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:42.380
- Oh. well. I'm happy if you are.

1124
01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:44.640
- So happy. I'm so happy.

1125
01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.253
What is 'tis the clock?

1126
01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.310
- 10 of.

1127
01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:49.880
- Let's end the day on that note.

1128
01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.040
Great work. everybody.

1129
01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:52.873
Wow.

1130
01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:55.930
We're gonna plunge into act two tomorrow.

1131
01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:58.980
So look over your lines and get some rest.

1132
01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.710
Thank you so much.

1133
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:02.280
- So much for your bad luck.

1134
01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.030
- Christ. don't say that

1135
01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:11.293
- Adam.

1136
01:04:11.293 --> 01:04:12.126
- Yeah?

1137
01:04:12.126 --> 01:04:12.959
You coming out?

1138
01:04:12.959 --> 01:04:14.107
A bunch of us are
heading to Crown Headler.

1139
01:04:14.107 --> 01:04:15.860
- Oh. I. I can't.

1140
01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:17.160
I have some reading to do.

1141
01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.180
- How about after reading?

1142
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:24.130
- We'll see.

1143
01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:25.623
- Yeah. we'll see means no.

1144
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.140
- Means we'll see.

1145
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.500
- You're impossible.

1146
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.678
- Sorry.

1147
01:04:30.678 --> 01:04:31.528
- Don't be sorry.

1148
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:33.630
It's your loss

1149
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:52.650
- Yet if I life and all its bright renown

1150
01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:54.963
be severed from the fabric of thy work.

1151
01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.463
it is a blessing in a curse's gown.

1152
01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:02.950
a gleaming diamond set in dimmest Merck

1153
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:07.350
for poets live through
poetry and. thus. by life.

1154
01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:11.433
by true life. is attained in us.

1155
01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.720
- It's wonderful.

1156
01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.796
It's wonderful. who wrote it?

1157
01:05:16.796 --> 01:05:17.629
- Sydney?

1158
01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.393
- Oh. I don't know. Tennyson?

1159
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:23.713
- It was Hugh Painter.

1160
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:26.563
- Seriously.
- Oh yes.

1161
01:05:26.563 --> 01:05:28.770
- That's very good. Hugh.

1162
01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:31.170
- I thank thee lady for thy fair report.

1163
01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:33.570
Yet I'm aggrieved to
find thee so surprised.

1164
01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:37.120
- Well. I had no idea you were a writer.

1165
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.010
- I dabbled.

1166
01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:41.020
It's all hopelessly
old-fashioned. of course.

1167
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.293
And then again. all the best things are.

1168
01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.380
- If you will excuse me a moment.

1169
01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.240
I am going to go and check on Adam.

1170
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.790
- Would you tell him to get
in here and be sociable?

1171
01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:57.580
I mean that boy works too hard.

1172
01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.080
It's not good for the soul.

1173
01:05:59.080 --> 01:05:59.913
- I'll tell him.

1174
01:05:59.913 --> 01:06:00.746
- Thank you.

1175
01:06:02.203 --> 01:06:05.140
- Now. this is going to seem
like a very ignorant question.

1176
01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:09.330
- Oh. my dear lady. there
are no ignorant questions.

1177
01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:12.563
We all quest after
knowledge in our own way.

1178
01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:18.957
- What do you think?

1179
01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:23.360
- It's interesting.

1180
01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.193
- Just wait.

1181
01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:26.693
- Okay.

1182
01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:32.510
- Uh. can I get you anything?

1183
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:34.990
Tea. whiskey. tea with whiskey?

1184
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:36.140
- No. I'm fine. thanks.

1185
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:45.283
Sydney.
- Yup. yeah. mm-hm.

1186
01:07:10.577 --> 01:07:11.410
- Come in.

1187
01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:16.643
Did you read it?

1188
01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:19.840
- I did.

1189
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:20.673
- And?

1190
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:32.620
- Sydney. I can't use this.

1191
01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:40.240
It's a new play.

1192
01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:43.010
It's a different play.

1193
01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:44.090
It's brilliant.

1194
01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:47.660
And it's beautiful.
but it's not "Macbeth".

1195
01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.910
- It's the heart of "Macbeth".

1196
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:51.770
- I don't disagree.

1197
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:54.093
I like letting him stew in his castle.

1198
01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.770
I like hearing about the alliance

1199
01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:59.666
between Macduff and Malcolm
instead of seeing it.

1200
01:07:59.666 --> 01:08:03.850
I love watching Lady M unravel

1201
01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:05.420
instead of just hearing about it.

1202
01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.070
It's cleaner. it's tighter.

1203
01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:12.070
It's more psychologically
intense. but it's not Shakespeare.

1204
01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:15.892
Shakespeare jumps around.

1205
01:08:15.892 --> 01:08:18.740
He shows us irrelevant things.

1206
01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:22.080
He wants the stage to
be England and Scotland

1207
01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.550
and the castle and the tavern
and Birnam Wood all at once.

1208
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:27.200
That's how this play works.

1209
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.263
It's a mess. but it's his mess.

1210
01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.510
This is something new.

1211
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:36.720
- Maybe he's learned a
thing or two in 400 years.

1212
01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.510
- You're still claiming
that Shakespeare wrote this?

1213
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:40.430
- Who else could?

1214
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:43.273
- Well. you.

1215
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.640
- You think I wrote that?

1216
01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.840
- You gave it to me.

1217
01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.265
- So?

1218
01:08:53.265 --> 01:08:54.880
- So you tell me.

1219
01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.880
- Adam. I couldn't write that.
not in four million years.

1220
01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.010
Could you?
- No. no I couldn't.

1221
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:02.490
But someone could.

1222
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:05.640
Shakespeare wasn't a God.

1223
01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.370
We pretend that he was. but he wasn't.

1224
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:09.540
He was just a guy. a very talented guy.

1225
01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.860
but there have always
been people like that.

1226
01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:13.620
- Okay. so what's your theory?

1227
01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:16.800
That I have a very
gifted playwright friend

1228
01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.420
and we got together and
concocted this version

1229
01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:22.170
and I have waited until
now to force it upon you?

1230
01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:24.020
- I don't know. Sydney. I don't know.

1231
01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:27.900
I was up half the night
reading this and rereading it.

1232
01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:29.840
And it is great. it's completely great.

1233
01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.040
but it is not the play
you signed up to do.

1234
01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.190
We can't put this up
and call it "Macbeth".

1235
01:09:35.190 --> 01:09:37.661
We'd be laughed at. we'd look like idiots.

1236
01:09:37.661 --> 01:09:40.950
- Oh. well. there you go.

1237
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:41.990
- There I go what?

1238
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:43.980
- There you go. there's the real Adam.

1239
01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:45.830
You don't care about this play.

1240
01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:47.093
You just worry about
what people will think.

1241
01:09:47.093 --> 01:09:48.400
- That is not fair.

1242
01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.790
- No. which part is unfair?

1243
01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:51.177
- I am doing my job here. Sydney.

1244
01:09:51.177 --> 01:09:52.530
No. you're doing your career.

1245
01:09:52.530 --> 01:09:53.840
- I am directing Shakespeare.

1246
01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.870
- Sure. you are. of course you are.

1247
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:56.812
And who gives a damn
what Shakespeare thinks?

1248
01:09:56.812 --> 01:09:58.300
- Well. that's what it really
comes down to. isn't it.

1249
01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:59.990
So let's talk about that for a second.

1250
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:03.500
I don't believe for a second
that you met Shakespeare

1251
01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.480
or that he gave you
these pages. and why not?

1252
01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.003
Because I'm not insane. Sydney.

1253
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:11.420
And I don't think you are either.

1254
01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:15.060
So what's going on?

1255
01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.200
- I told you.

1256
01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.763
- But you don't expect me
to actually believe it.

1257
01:10:21.272 --> 01:10:22.105
Do you?

1258
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:29.323
- No.

1259
01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.163
No. I guess not.

1260
01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:43.503
Thank you for reading it.

1261
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:56.443
- I'm sorry.

1262
01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:00.710
- Don't be sorry. Adam.

1263
01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.157
Just get out.

1264
01:11:28.959 --> 01:11:29.792
Damn it.

1265
01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:46.450
- The costumes we pulled from the shop

1266
01:11:46.450 --> 01:11:48.320
are downstairs getting ironed.

1267
01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.950
Set building is underway.

1268
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:51.490
We'll try to keep the noise to a minimum.

1269
01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:52.400
- That is great.

1270
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.770
And the stained glass come in?

1271
01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:57.810
- Just now. the museum
wanted to remind us again

1272
01:11:57.810 --> 01:12:01.240
how precious and fragile
and historic it is.

1273
01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.900
- Aren't they the ones
who begged us to use it?

1274
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.113
- No comment.

1275
01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:09.320
- You missed a pretty good
time last night. Adam.

1276
01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.750
- I believe you.

1277
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:12.010
- Well. we're going out again tonight.

1278
01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:13.770
if you're done with your reading.

1279
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:14.770
- Yeah. I'll prob...

1280
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.740
I'll be there.

1281
01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:21.800
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

1282
01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.670
I'm allowed to have fun once in a while.

1283
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:25.830
- Actually. in your
contract. it says you're not.

1284
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:29.180
- Well. screw the contract.

1285
01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:31.563
- I mean. okay. I warned you.

1286
01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.370
- Okay. that's five minutes. everybody.

1287
01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:39.203
Thank you.

1288
01:12:39.203 --> 01:12:41.003
- I need a smoke. do you want one?

1289
01:12:41.003 --> 01:12:42.680
- No. but I'll watch.

1290
01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.220
- Oh. can you grab that plywood
and set up the prop table?

1291
01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:46.600
- Yup.

1292
01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.130
- Oh. and Jess is coming up in a second.

1293
01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.980
She wants you to see her costume.

1294
01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:50.820
- I've seen the photos.

1295
01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:53.107
- She wants you to see it on her.

1296
01:12:56.695 --> 01:12:59.543
- And I'm gonna need to see
the plan for the stage again.

1297
01:12:59.543 --> 01:13:02.003
I'm worried about the
down stage playing area.

1298
01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.160
Is the shop gonna hate me?

1299
01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.940
- They already hate you.

1300
01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.400
- I might as well get what I want.

1301
01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.233
- Hey Adam.

1302
01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.320
You don't like it.

1303
01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.195
- You've just got. you've
got a little bit of um.

1304
01:13:21.799 --> 01:13:24.350
You're bleeding a lot.
- Yeah. yeah.

1305
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:27.653
Your nose is.

1306
01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:29.770
- Well. there goes that.

1307
01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:31.360
Can I get a little help up here?

1308
01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.393
- Jesus!

1309
01:13:32.393 --> 01:13:34.140
- I mean whenever you--

1310
01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:35.455
- Fire!

1311
01:13:35.455 --> 01:13:37.513
Fire. fire. everybody out!

1312
01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:40.921
- Shit. Adam. help me with this ladder!

1313
01:13:40.921 --> 01:13:42.588
- What is happening?

1314
01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:46.860
Well. the good news is

1315
01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:48.533
the theater's still standing.

1316
01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:51.030
- Are we all fired?

1317
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:52.143
- Not that I've heard.

1318
01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:57.550
I spoke to the costume people.

1319
01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:59.010
They're very sorry.

1320
01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:00.690
One of the interns left an iron

1321
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:02.593
on some polyester pants.

1322
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.937
- Why do we have polyester
pants in "Macbeth"?

1323
01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:09.724
- They don't look polyester.

1324
01:14:09.724 --> 01:14:12.724
- They don't look like anything now.

1325
01:14:14.404 --> 01:14:15.600
- You should get some rest.

1326
01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.790
There's nothing more you can do today.

1327
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:19.750
- There must be someone left
I haven't apologized to.

1328
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:20.633
- Me. maybe.

1329
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:24.010
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

1330
01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:24.843
- Whatever.

1331
01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.920
- Get some sleep.

1332
01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.093
Tomorrow's a new day.

1333
01:14:30.089 --> 01:14:32.800
- If it's anything like
today. let's just skip it.

1334
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:33.790
- I'll make a note.

1335
01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:05.960
- I know you're out here.

1336
01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.920
Will Shakespeare!

1337
01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.263
You come face me right now.

1338
01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:15.020
- I hath espy some subtle tinge of wrath

1339
01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:17.870
about the edges of thy beauty's glow.

1340
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:19.720
- I am not in the mood
for your shit right now.

1341
01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.600
- And yet I know not
why. it is fine manure

1342
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.760
in which good players flourish admirably.

1343
01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.990
- You lied to me.

1344
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:28.300
- I never in my life.

1345
01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:30.100
- It's not the witch who cursed the play.

1346
01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.017
It's you.

1347
01:15:31.017 --> 01:15:33.300
- Why. with what power?

1348
01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:36.210
I am mortal made and no more potent

1349
01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:37.550
in such arts than you.

1350
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:39.250
- Don't play the innocent.

1351
01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:42.190
You hate this play and
we won't let you fix it.

1352
01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:45.140
So you throw a stupid
tantrum hoping to scare us.

1353
01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.530
- You wrong me. lady.

1354
01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:48.470
- It's so obvious.

1355
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:51.330
When I gave Adam your new
pages. you were pacified

1356
01:15:51.330 --> 01:15:52.420
and we had a good day.

1357
01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:54.890
Then when Adam said he wouldn't use them.

1358
01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:56.730
that's when everything went cockeyed.

1359
01:15:56.730 --> 01:15:58.100
You're the curse.

1360
01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:01.610
- I have some magic. this I'll not deny.

1361
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:03.640
To be a ghost has compensations

1362
01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.470
and I make with them what sport I may.

1363
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:09.930
Your friend. Hugh Painter.
you did call a knave.

1364
01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:12.530
And I. the thinking me of this.

1365
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:17.530
did give him cause by dint of
some light warning to repent.

1366
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:19.090
- You almost killed him.

1367
01:16:19.090 --> 01:16:20.270
- Nay. my aim was good.

1368
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:22.530
I meant to frighten him. and so I did.

1369
01:16:22.530 --> 01:16:23.940
- You set the place on fire!

1370
01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:24.973
- What could I do!

1371
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:31.520
This dwarf. ungainly tragedy
is a blot upon the canvas

1372
01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.520
of my life's proud work and
men will still perform it.

1373
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:40.180
Hearing enduring echos on
the stages of the world

1374
01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:45.180
with such a grinding music that
it keeps my soul from rest.

1375
01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.770
from peace. from God himself.

1376
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.880
- You're such a moron.
it's a classic play.

1377
01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.840
- 'Tis half of heaven. half of musty hell.

1378
01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.710
Some speeches. I confess.
are definitely rot

1379
01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:01.930
and all the nobler for their brevity.

1380
01:17:01.930 --> 01:17:05.160
But other parts are
clumsy. bald and schooled

1381
01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.500
as if some thick-thumbed
child roughed them out

1382
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:12.050
intending to return and make them shine.

1383
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:14.383
but soon forgetting as all children will.

1384
01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:20.250
That child was I when
queuing out this work

1385
01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:23.350
the time outpaced me and
all. hopefully. I made

1386
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:25.576
what best I could of it.

1387
01:17:25.576 --> 01:17:28.750
And now I reap the poison
that my hands did so.

1388
01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:31.883
What agonies in that few souls can know.

1389
01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.610
- I'm sorry.

1390
01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:38.200
I can see that would be hard.

1391
01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.840
But your reaction isn't helping things.

1392
01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.240
We're not your enemy.

1393
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.170
Call off the curse.

1394
01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:48.683
It's making a bad situation worse.

1395
01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:51.780
- I cannot do it.

1396
01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:54.570
- Oh. you can and you will.

1397
01:17:54.570 --> 01:17:57.923
- Nay. I will hold my
ground for good or ill.

1398
01:17:59.702 --> 01:18:02.880
Nothing stand to lose by flouting you

1399
01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.010
but your good graces
would you have withdrawn.

1400
01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:09.060
What then remains for
you to threaten me with

1401
01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:12.523
but futile anger lacking weight or pith.

1402
01:18:14.130 --> 01:18:15.670
You're such a jackass.

1403
01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:17.780
- That's as it may be.

1404
01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:21.450
Thou must decide how best to deal with me.

1405
01:18:21.450 --> 01:18:24.880
I am the wolf no longer held at bay.

1406
01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.793
I will be fed one way or the other way.

1407
01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:38.973
- All right. come on.

1408
01:18:45.765 --> 01:18:46.598
Adam.
- Mm.

1409
01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:48.810
Adam. wake up.

1410
01:18:58.810 --> 01:19:00.120
- Am I dreaming?

1411
01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.220
- You're not dreaming.

1412
01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.193
There's someone I want you to meet.

1413
01:19:11.393 --> 01:19:12.610
- Who the hell is this?

1414
01:19:12.610 --> 01:19:16.830
- A man you know too
well and yet know not.

1415
01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:20.710
An all neglected and all worshiped man.

1416
01:19:20.710 --> 01:19:25.710
forgotten. famed. admired and
cast off. a walking paradox.

1417
01:19:27.690 --> 01:19:28.873
Your servant. sir.

1418
01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.400
- Holy shit!

1419
01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.710
- Aye. there's another
worthy riddle. friend.

1420
01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:37.350
Can dung be holy?

1421
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:38.380
I am proof it can.

1422
01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:39.360
- It's you?

1423
01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.660
- It is.

1424
01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:41.610
- I'd know you anywhere.

1425
01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.350
- And yet you knew me not

1426
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:45.360
when. through my friend. this worthy lady.

1427
01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.420
I made bold to give some certain
hints how my unworthy play

1428
01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:52.880
might rise to better notice in your care.

1429
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.713
- I'm sorry.

1430
01:19:53.713 --> 01:19:55.030
- It is no matter. sir.

1431
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:58.260
You see me now and judge the weight of me.

1432
01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:01.460
Have I such substance has may tempt you

1433
01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:04.290
to accept my humble offering of words?

1434
01:20:04.290 --> 01:20:05.250
- I'm at your service.

1435
01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:07.040
- No. marry no such thing.

1436
01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:10.000
Let's rather say we both serve in our turn

1437
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.720
that rough and tameless
God that rules the stage

1438
01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:16.200
and makes our words as lightning steps.

1439
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:20.730
as thunderclaps when we are
brave enough to tread his boat.

1440
01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:22.460
- I'm at his service!

1441
01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:23.620
- Then it is done.

1442
01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:26.730
- Your work must finish
what I've scarce begun.

1443
01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:29.790
A play's a slack. unblooded. arid thing

1444
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:33.750
until the players make
it breathe and sing.

1445
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:34.980
I wrote the words.

1446
01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:38.600
Now. you must write the
life that warms the watcher

1447
01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.900
like a winter's wife.

1448
01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:45.200
I leave this task in your most
able hands and quit you now

1449
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.593
for colder. darker lands.

1450
01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:53.883
And now. fair Sydney.
know this well of me.

1451
01:20:54.871 --> 01:20:58.220
no mischief have I ever rot on thee.

1452
01:21:08.587 --> 01:21:09.420
- That.

1453
01:21:10.802 --> 01:21:12.208
That. that.

1454
01:21:12.208 --> 01:21:13.041
- Yes.

1455
01:21:14.122 --> 01:21:14.955
Yes!

1456
01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:23.430
- I am sorry.

1457
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:24.783
- I'm sorry too.

1458
01:21:26.690 --> 01:21:29.890
What do you think we should do?

1459
01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:31.723
I think we have to put it to a vote.

1460
01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:39.110
- This and what needful else

1461
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:41.610
that calls upon us by the grace of grace.

1462
01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:45.240
we will perform in measure time and place.

1463
01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:49.590
So thanks to all at once and
to each one whom we invite

1464
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:50.940
to see us crowned at Scone.

1465
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:54.910
- Exit all. followed
by the ghost of Duncan.

1466
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:57.363
ghost of Macbeth left alone onstage.

1467
01:21:58.310 --> 01:22:00.420
- And Duncan with them.

1468
01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:04.003
with as proud a grace as ever
in his regal life he showed.

1469
01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.920
His issue triumphs and my barren
seeds sticks in the ground

1470
01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:12.383
like rocks that clip the
plow and comes to nothing.

1471
01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:18.020
I dearly hoped that
death might be an ending

1472
01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.790
but I see such bitter
reaches of eternity stretch

1473
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:24.650
out before me that I
have repent that murder

1474
01:22:24.650 --> 01:22:27.173
on which all my hopes were spent.

1475
01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.793
No more of this.

1476
01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:33.670
What's done is all behind.

1477
01:22:33.670 --> 01:22:36.240
I'll lay the yolk on my unquiet mind

1478
01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:39.380
and in this Earth. I'll
cultivate the scene

1479
01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:42.423
of what undreamt of
glories might have been.

1480
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.883
If you would profit by my woeful tale.

1481
01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:51.840
think what a crime it
is to strive and fail.

1482
01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:55.883
- Exit Macbeth. end of play.

1483
01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.793
- Who wrote this?

1484
01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:06.993
- Just some guy.

1485
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:10.610
- It's very different.

1486
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:11.920
- It is. yeah.

1487
01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.140
- It's got a lot more of
me in it. which I like.

1488
01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:16.790
more of Sydney. which I like too.

1489
01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:19.543
- But what about narratively?

1490
01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:21.820
Does it work for you?

1491
01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:22.830
- Yeah. it works.

1492
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:24.010
Yeah. it works.

1493
01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:25.223
It's a different story.

1494
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:27.980
- Better story. worse story?

1495
01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:30.343
- Well. like I say. there's more of me.

1496
01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:36.740
- I mean. Hugh's addressing
the elephant in the room.

1497
01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:39.030
My part is a lot smaller. so is Sean's.

1498
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:41.270
It's hard for us to be objective.

1499
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:44.450
I mean. we can try. but it's asking a lot.

1500
01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:48.090
- I know. and I don't like
putting you in this position

1501
01:23:50.410 --> 01:23:51.243
but the truth.

1502
01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:54.483
the truth.

1503
01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.313
the truth is. um.

1504
01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:02.497
Sydney. you say it.

1505
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:14.933
- It was given to us by the
ghost of William Shakespeare.

1506
01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.133
- Well. that does change things.

1507
01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:27.840
- This is a prank. right?

1508
01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.420
This is like the guy with the
hood and the spooky voice.

1509
01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.253
This is a joke.

1510
01:24:32.253 --> 01:24:33.086
- It's not a joke.

1511
01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:36.453
- You saw a ghost?

1512
01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.133
- Yeah.

1513
01:24:40.814 --> 01:24:41.964
- You both saw a ghost?

1514
01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.193
- We did.

1515
01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.900
- All right. screw it. I'm in.

1516
01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:57.333
- Hugh?

1517
01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.913
- I live in service to the theater.

1518
01:25:06.006 --> 01:25:06.839
- Yeah.

1519
01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:21.390
- I'm voting no

1520
01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:23.450
because it's a whole new script

1521
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:26.510
and it's going to be
a logistical nightmare

1522
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:28.393
from every possible point of view.

1523
01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:33.063
Anyone else want to voice an opinion?

1524
01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:40.030
All right. let's break for lunch.

1525
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:42.030
Back in two hours with a whole new play.

1526
01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:49.003
- Hey. Lauren!

1527
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:52.530
I'm sorry.

1528
01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:54.100
- Are you kidding?

1529
01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.963
I live for shit shows like this.

1530
01:26:17.836 --> 01:26:19.990
- You need something. Hugh?

1531
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:21.960
- You do realize. of course.

1532
01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:25.943
that if all this goes
pear-shaped. it'll be on you.

1533
01:26:27.010 --> 01:26:30.393
The brash. young director who
spat on Shakespeare's grave.

1534
01:26:32.102 --> 01:26:34.170
- I kind of like that. actually.

1535
01:26:34.170 --> 01:26:35.003
- I do too.

1536
01:26:37.630 --> 01:26:38.463
Boy!

1537
01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:42.063
Take a deep breath. fearless leader.

1538
01:26:44.370 --> 01:26:46.933
the storm is about to begin.

1539
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:16.860
- It's a good house.

1540
01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:18.010
It's packed.

1541
01:27:18.010 --> 01:27:19.913
- Opening night. it should be.

1542
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:21.833
- You okay?

1543
01:27:22.869 --> 01:27:23.702
- Ah yeah.

1544
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.630
Go break a leg.

1545
01:27:26.630 --> 01:27:27.992
- You too.

1546
01:27:27.992 --> 01:27:28.992
- All right.

1547
01:27:34.630 --> 01:27:36.283
- Okay. house to black please.

1548
01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:39.840
Ready Q2. ready sound QA.

1549
01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.206
Both on my mark.

1550
01:27:41.206 --> 01:27:42.710
Standing by.

1551
01:27:42.710 --> 01:27:44.853
- Go.

1552
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:47.437
And we're off.

1553
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:52.220
- Great Glamis. worthy Cawdor!

1554
01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:55.600
Greater than both. by
the all-hail hereafter!

1555
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.057
Thy letters have transported me

1556
01:27:57.057 --> 01:27:59.010
beyond this ignorant present.

1557
01:27:59.010 --> 01:28:03.150
and I feel now the future in the instant.

1558
01:28:03.150 --> 01:28:07.303
- My dearest love. Duncan
comes here tonight.

1559
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:09.610
- And when goes hence?

1560
01:28:09.610 --> 01:28:12.280
- Tomorrow. as he purposes.

1561
01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:15.293
- O. never shall sun that morrow see!

1562
01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.670
Your face. my thane.
is as a book where men

1563
01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:22.760
may read strange matters
to beguile the time.

1564
01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.660
look like the time.

1565
01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:26.250
Bear welcome in your eye.

1566
01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:28.543
your hand. your tongue.

1567
01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:33.300
look like the innocent flower.

1568
01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:35.043
but be the serpent under it.

1569
01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:38.197
He that's coming must be provided for

1570
01:28:38.197 --> 01:28:40.260
and you shall put this
night's great business

1571
01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:44.480
into my dispatch which shall
to all our nights and days

1572
01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:48.903
to come give solely
sovereign sway and masterdom.

1573
01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:52.063
- We will speak further.

1574
01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:56.763
- Only look up clear.

1575
01:28:57.690 --> 01:29:00.523
To alter favor ever is to fear.

1576
01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.723
Leave all the rest to me.

1577
01:29:10.730 --> 01:29:11.813
- Ready. Q43.

1578
01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:13.853
Go.

1579
01:29:15.116 --> 01:29:18.900
- Thy dreams. my dearest.
are much wondered at.

1580
01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:22.630
- Do servants gossip?

1581
01:29:22.630 --> 01:29:24.033
You amaze me. sir.

1582
01:29:25.010 --> 01:29:30.010
- Nay. I confess my own
heart slips to doubt

1583
01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.460
when I do hear thy wanderings at night

1584
01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:34.900
and how thy speech does
wonder with thy feet.

1585
01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:37.370
- My tongue and feet
shall do as pleases them

1586
01:29:37.370 --> 01:29:39.970
and thou must keep a
better watch on thine.

1587
01:29:39.970 --> 01:29:42.363
- I don't remember this part.

1588
01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:47.500
- Cannot we speak of
what our hearts do know.

1589
01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:48.550
I know what ails you.

1590
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:51.390
I felt it too.

1591
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:54.820
Yet guilt is nothing.
mark me well in that.

1592
01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:57.190
It is a demon sent to harry thee by gods

1593
01:29:57.190 --> 01:29:59.320
of envy coveting thy state.

1594
01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.900
It is a pale and vanishing conceit

1595
01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:03.650
built of a thousand nothings

1596
01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:07.183
and dispelled the minute
it is boldly looked upon.

1597
01:30:08.490 --> 01:30:11.190
From thee I had this moral.

1598
01:30:11.190 --> 01:30:13.740
Now let me. that was my student.

1599
01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.813
- Don't touch with thy filth!

1600
01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:19.970
The bloody-dripping and blaspheming man.

1601
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:22.580
Thy boots awash with ruby-seeming blood

1602
01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:25.040
make of my carpet a red patched rag.

1603
01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:28.880
Thy face is not the face I doted on.

1604
01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:32.500
but leaks mute rivers of accusing stain

1605
01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:36.840
and thou art not my
husband. but a fiend fierce

1606
01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:41.043
and tormenting and claiming me for health.

1607
01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.560
- This madness is too
near the truth of things

1608
01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:48.913
which men may guess.

1609
01:30:50.150 --> 01:30:52.513
Her dream disaster brings.

1610
01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:56.820
Yet such defiance in the teeth of fate

1611
01:30:56.820 --> 01:31:01.543
fills full my heart with
love to match her hate.

1612
01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.673
- Plays.

1613
01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:06.923
Plays.

1614
01:31:06.923 --> 01:31:08.940
God save the mark. it plays.

1615
01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:10.690
- Sorry. who are you?

1616
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:13.820
- One William Shakespeare.

1617
01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:16.190
- Oh. I love your work.

1618
01:31:16.190 --> 01:31:17.490
- I humbly thank you.

1619
01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:19.514
- Stay out of the way.

1620
01:31:25.319 --> 01:31:27.902
Hail. King of Scotland.

1621
01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:45.660
- We shall not spend a
large expense of time

1622
01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:48.420
before we reckon with your several loves

1623
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.823
and make us even with you.

1624
01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:56.110
What is more. we'll ferret
out the cruel ministers

1625
01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:59.220
of this dead butcher and
his fiend like queen.

1626
01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:01.270
This. and what needful else

1627
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:03.440
that calls upon us by the grace of grace.

1628
01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:07.550
we will perform in measure time and place.

1629
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:10.330
So thanks to all at once

1630
01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:16.453
and to each one whom we invite
to see us crowned at Scone.

1631
01:32:28.770 --> 01:32:33.770
- And Duncan with them. with
as proud a grace as ever

1632
01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.113
in his regal life he's shown.

1633
01:32:37.650 --> 01:32:39.313
His issue triumphs.

1634
01:32:40.210 --> 01:32:44.270
And my barren seed sticks
in the ground like rocks

1635
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:47.583
that clipped the plow
and comes to nothing.

1636
01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:53.303
I dearly hoped that
death might be an ending.

1637
01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:58.240
but I see such bitter reaches
of eternity stretch out

1638
01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:02.470
before me that I hath repent that murder

1639
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:04.583
on which all my hopes were spent.

1640
01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:07.373
No more of this.

1641
01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:10.950
What's done is all behind.

1642
01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:15.670
I'll lay the yolk on my unquiet mind.

1643
01:33:15.670 --> 01:33:19.720
And in this dirt. I'll cultivate the scene

1644
01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:23.033
of what undreamt of glories might've been.

1645
01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.643
If you would profit by my woeful tale.

1646
01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:32.673
think what a crime it
is to strive and fail.

1647
01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:21.303
- That was not "Macbeth".

1648
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:24.200
- I know.

1649
01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.240
Sorry.

1650
01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.113
- Don't be sorry.

1651
01:34:27.118 --> 01:34:29.243
I loved it.

1652
01:34:38.851 --> 01:34:40.851
- So what did you think?

1653
01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:47.908
Yeah. that was weird.

1654
01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:06.270
- To William Shakespeare.

1655
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:10.310
To William Shakespeare.

1656
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:12.200
- Where is the bastard anyway?

1657
01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.550
- No idea. I haven't
seen him in over a week.

1658
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:17.750
- Lauren said she saw him backstage

1659
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:19.350
and he seemed very happy.

1660
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:20.560
- Where is Lauren?

1661
01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:22.110
- She went to bed hours ago.

1662
01:35:22.110 --> 01:35:23.930
- Oh God. I hate responsible people.

1663
01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:24.813
- Yeah.
- Mm-mm.

1664
01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:29.470
- Well. I'm tired of waiting
for the dead white male.

1665
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:31.847
If he shows up. tell him
I'm grateful. et cetera.

1666
01:35:31.847 --> 01:35:33.920
- You're the soul of poetry. you.

1667
01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.453
- Oh. bite me.

1668
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:43.470
- I think I'm gonna head in too.

1669
01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:46.373
Muah.

1670
01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:51.543
Congratulations.

1671
01:35:52.524 --> 01:35:53.941
You too.

1672
01:35:55.588 --> 01:35:57.338
- You were wonderful tonight. Jess.

1673
01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:01.030
- Yeah. you too. Syd.

1674
01:36:02.245 --> 01:36:03.100
I'll see you in the morning.

1675
01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:05.150
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1676
01:36:14.566 --> 01:36:17.524
- You know you really
missed the boat on that one.

1677
01:36:17.524 --> 01:36:19.924
- I actually think they're
a much better couple.

1678
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:22.617
- You may be right.

1679
01:36:24.970 --> 01:36:26.670
- I think we're gonna turn in too.

1680
01:36:27.710 --> 01:36:30.100
Goodnight. you crazy kids.

1681
01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:31.273
Don't stay up out late.

1682
01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:33.920
- Hey. Lucas.

1683
01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:34.753
Yeah.

1684
01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:39.380
- Thank you. taking a chance on this.

1685
01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:42.190
I think your vote really
made the difference.

1686
01:36:42.190 --> 01:36:43.601
- Huh.

1687
01:36:43.601 --> 01:36:45.460
- It's a crazy thing we did.

1688
01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:47.863
- Yeah. well. it's kinda why I liked it.

1689
01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:52.603
Hey. next time. though. I'm Macbeth.

1690
01:36:53.670 --> 01:36:54.920
- It's a promise.

1691
01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.110
- Good enough. goodnight.

1692
01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:56.943
- Good night. Lucas. goodnight. Sean.

1693
01:36:56.943 --> 01:36:58.510
- Goodnight. Sean.
- Goodnight.

1694
01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:05.700
- Are they?

1695
01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:06.533
- Oh yeah.

1696
01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:08.553
- Wow. I.

1697
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:13.320
I had no idea.

1698
01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:14.373
- Seriously?

1699
01:37:15.670 --> 01:37:16.503
- Am I an idiot?

1700
01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:19.333
- I guess you must be.

1701
01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:26.393
So you're heading out tomorrow?

1702
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:31.670
- I have to. my agent
set up 10.000 meetings

1703
01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:33.450
for me in the city.

1704
01:37:33.450 --> 01:37:36.180
- Well. I'm glad to know
that our little sacrilege

1705
01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:38.410
hasn't killed you career.

1706
01:37:38.410 --> 01:37:39.460
- There's still time.

1707
01:37:42.150 --> 01:37:44.180
- We'll miss you up here.

1708
01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:46.260
- I'll be back in a week or two

1709
01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:47.760
to see how everything's going.

1710
01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:51.070
You guys don't need me. though.

1711
01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:52.020
It's your play now.

1712
01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:54.960
- It's Will's play.

1713
01:37:57.190 --> 01:37:58.023
- Yeah.

1714
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:06.250
I should get some shut-eye. I guess.

1715
01:38:06.250 --> 01:38:08.483
- Yeah. yeah. yep. good idea.

1716
01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:13.840
- You'll walk me in?

1717
01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.373
- No. I think I'm gonna linger.

1718
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:19.210
It's a nice night.

1719
01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:22.640
- Congratulations.

1720
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:24.583
- You too. boss.

1721
01:38:25.603 --> 01:38:26.436
- Hmm.

1722
01:38:54.044 --> 01:38:55.194
- I thought you'd gone.

1723
01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:57.890
- So too did I.

1724
01:38:59.423 --> 01:39:02.830
And yet I linger. what makes thou of that?

1725
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:06.643
Some weighty business
binds me to this place.

1726
01:39:06.643 --> 01:39:11.110
but what its substance is. I cannot guess.

1727
01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:13.363
- Thou mockest me.

1728
01:39:13.363 --> 01:39:17.570
- I faith. I do. but with as kind a heart

1729
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:20.240
as generous a tongue has ever youth

1730
01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:22.423
did mock his scented bride.

1731
01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:26.163
I know my business well and servest thou.

1732
01:39:27.330 --> 01:39:30.313
I speak of Adam and thou knowest why.

1733
01:39:32.150 --> 01:39:33.430
- He is too young.

1734
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:35.270
- Why age must temper him

1735
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:38.730
and thou his tutor gave
what help thou canst.

1736
01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:39.970
- I am too old.

1737
01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:41.810
- In no particular.

1738
01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:44.440
Are thee young in mind and zest of spirit

1739
01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:49.260
and in grace of faith. thou
has a raft of qualities

1740
01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:52.313
that many maids of 20 dearly crave.

1741
01:39:54.690 --> 01:39:57.090
Thy arguments. thus far.
have gone for nought.

1742
01:39:57.090 --> 01:39:58.983
my reasons swiftly cancels them.

1743
01:40:00.483 --> 01:40:01.950
Look. try again.

1744
01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:03.230
- He leaves tomorrow.

1745
01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:05.200
- Then remains tonight.

1746
01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.330
And in that darkling and abandoned wild

1747
01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:11.000
with one half light and
other men have wrought

1748
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.580
much wilder things than this.

1749
01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:16.000
Seize the night.

1750
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.380
The day will dawn too
late and seizing that

1751
01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:20.000
will gain you only ashes.

1752
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.150
Act and win.

1753
01:40:22.150 --> 01:40:24.560
- Thou art full of mischief.

1754
01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.903
- I am full of truth.

1755
01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:33.123
I'm too near death to
waste my time or thine.

1756
01:40:35.050 --> 01:40:37.580
Already. I can hear it calling me.

1757
01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:40.630
that blank hereafter into which I gazed.

1758
01:40:40.630 --> 01:40:43.503
but many and many a time it was outside.

1759
01:40:45.330 --> 01:40:48.910
I'll see it now if there be ought to see.

1760
01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:53.910
If all is darkness.
that's a kind of peace.

1761
01:40:56.570 --> 01:41:01.010
I am not weary. yet I feel my time

1762
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:03.843
slip through the slender of the hourglass.

1763
01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:08.763
Grant me this boon before I go to rest.

1764
01:41:10.147 --> 01:41:13.913
And promise me to love that foolish man.

1765
01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:19.420
- I'll crave one moment
of your time of that.

1766
01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:21.710
- Then speak with purpose.

1767
01:41:21.710 --> 01:41:23.303
I am half away.

1768
01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:29.063
- 'Tis poor to thank
what cannot be repaid.

1769
01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:35.050
A rich gift handed down the
centuries. reviving to the soul.

1770
01:41:35.050 --> 01:41:40.050
sweet on the tongue. 10.000
stages gracing with its grace.

1771
01:41:40.570 --> 01:41:43.637
Thy words. thy all beguiling words.

1772
01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:51.463
divine and human and immortal words.

1773
01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.273
what poet does not till
the ground you sowed?

1774
01:41:58.350 --> 01:42:01.643
What player does not flourish in thy soil?

1775
01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:05.980
What person. lettered or unlettered.

1776
01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:10.033
can. with reason. claim he
rests not in your shade?

1777
01:42:11.770 --> 01:42:15.550
This English. that my
mind and heart revere.

1778
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:19.890
this gnarled. beautiful and bastard tongue

1779
01:42:19.890 --> 01:42:22.620
flows through thee like
a river through a sieve

1780
01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:27.093
emerging swift and
grateful. cold and clean.

1781
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.800
What thanks. why any thanks would pale.

1782
01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:38.113
Yet hear my gratitude. it sings in me.

1783
01:42:44.193 --> 01:42:46.183
- 'Tis well. 'tis welcome.

1784
01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:51.243
'Tis most ably said.

1785
01:42:52.856 --> 01:42:55.830
- I had a bit of help there from a knave.

1786
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:59.693
- A knave may have his uses. mark ye that.

1787
01:42:59.693 --> 01:43:01.560
- I mark it well.

1788
01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.740
Thou art thyself a knave.

1789
01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:05.943
And thou has had thy uses.

1790
01:43:07.248 --> 01:43:08.081
Now. be gone.

1791
01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:12.777
This time is our time
now. for good or ill.

1792
01:43:13.719 --> 01:43:17.080
And thou must haunt it
only with thy plays.

1793
01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.996
- That suits me well.

1794
01:43:18.996 --> 01:43:21.050
And yet there's one thing more.

1795
01:43:21.050 --> 01:43:22.270
- What thing is that?

1796
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:23.570
- Why this unworthy thing.

1797
01:43:37.548 --> 01:43:40.965
Now come what may to thee in later times.

1798
01:43:42.136 --> 01:43:44.523
thou art the last to have a kiss from me.

1799
01:43:46.110 --> 01:43:47.263
Keep well this secret.

1800
01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:50.120
Clasp it to your heart.

1801
01:43:52.074 --> 01:43:55.780
in thee.

1802
01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:57.290
- You arrogant bastard.

1803
01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:58.597
- So I am.

1804
01:43:58.597 --> 01:44:01.393
But what man living has more cause than I?

1805
01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:05.223
Think kindly on me. Sydney.

1806
01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:11.680
I am dead and dead men
have no life but in report.

1807
01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:17.250
- I'll think on thee as
I may choose to think.

1808
01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:18.400
- I'll not begrudge it.

1809
01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:21.290
To be in my thoughts in anyways

1810
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:23.510
is all the thanks I crave.

1811
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:26.700
- Go to. go to. thou
great unceasing mouth.

1812
01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:30.053
- I'll cease upon an instant like all men.

1813
01:44:30.970 --> 01:44:33.643
And when once gone. I'll not return again.

1814
01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:36.097
- I'll miss thee. Will.

1815
01:44:36.097 --> 01:44:39.970
- And I shall dream of
you as all men ought to

1816
01:44:39.970 --> 01:44:42.353
and as many do.

1817
01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:45.793
One couplet more and
then I'll say goodnight.

1818
01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:51.213
Make what frail joy thou
canst in thy brief light.

1819
01:44:52.810 --> 01:44:53.643
- I will.

1820
01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:56.273
I will.

1821
01:44:57.872 --> 01:44:59.833
Farewell. my sweetest Will.

1822
01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:05.053
Thou has done mischief.
but more good than ill.

1823
01:45:47.230 --> 01:45:50.780
- You're the most predictable
man I've ever met.

1824
01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.840
- I'll take any superlative.

1825
01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:53.673
- Good call.

1826
01:45:55.777 --> 01:45:56.827
What are you reading?

1827
01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:01.620
- Agricultural Practice
in Early New England.

1828
01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:02.550
- How is it?

1829
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:04.350
- It's better than you would expect.

1830
01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:12.370
Looks like we're the last ones up.

1831
01:46:12.370 --> 01:46:14.783
- Looks like it. yup.

1832
01:46:18.150 --> 01:46:19.560
- So?

1833
01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:20.423
- So.

1834
01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:25.460
I'm 44.

1835
01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:26.760
- I'm 32.

1836
01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:27.593
- You're young.

1837
01:46:27.593 --> 01:46:28.426
- You're gorgeous.

1838
01:46:28.426 --> 01:46:29.259
- Don't change the subject.

1839
01:46:29.259 --> 01:46:30.092
- I wasn't.

1840
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:37.050
- You want a nightcap?

1841
01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.973
I got a decent bottle
of scotch in my room.

1842
01:46:43.670 --> 01:46:45.970
- Don't you think it's sketchy

1843
01:46:45.970 --> 01:46:49.925
when directors hit on their actresses?

1844
01:46:49.925 --> 01:46:51.380
- I do.

1845
01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:53.950
But I'm not your director anymore.

1846
01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:54.783
- Oh.

1847
01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:57.803
- Plus I think you are amazing.

1848
01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:02.853
which kind of negates the sketchiness.

1849
01:47:03.730 --> 01:47:05.850
- That sounds like whiskey logic.

1850
01:47:05.850 --> 01:47:06.683
- I've had like

1851
01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:10.903
five.

1852
01:47:12.370 --> 01:47:13.203
- Oh.

1853
01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:20.893
I tell you what.

1854
01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:25.100
You're coming back up here. in what.

1855
01:47:26.778 --> 01:47:28.230
a week or two?

1856
01:47:28.230 --> 01:47:29.330
- Something like that.

1857
01:47:32.328 --> 01:47:33.161
- Buy me dinner?

1858
01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:36.120
- That sounds nice.

1859
01:48:09.973 --> 01:48:13.328
- Good night. Adam.

1860
01:48:13.328 --> 01:48:14.411
- Good night.

1861
01:51:13.651 --> 01:51:18.651
and a stupid grin

1862
01:51:19.614 --> 01:51:24.614
which shoes to fit in
