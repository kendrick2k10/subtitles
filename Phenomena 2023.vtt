"PHENOMENA AT THE PALACE"

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:52.208
PHENOMENA

11
00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:19.041
Excuse me. Thank you.

12
00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:24.166
Father. it's been a long time.
We thought you had died.

13
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.750
No. don't worry. son.
If I die. I'll send you a sign.

14
00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:28.791
-God forbid.
-Let's go back there.

15
00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:30.958
So. black or with milk?

16
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:33.916
Make the first one black.
Has anyone else shown up?

17
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.250
You're the first. Father.

18
00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:37.333
Thank you. son.

19
00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:10.541
Edward Witten's M-theory…

20
00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:12.666
NEW HORIZONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS

21
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.750
…has its origin in string theory.

22
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:21.041
according to which all particles are--

23
00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:27.666
Man. I'm not getting any of this.

24
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.250
I promised the Cambridge professors
we'd take them to eat tripe tonight.

25
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.833
Tripe for dinner?

26
00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:35.750
What do you expect? They're English.

27
00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:38.125
No. I have a meeting tonight and--

28
00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:41.541
See you in 20 minutes.

29
00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.208
We will resume next week.

30
00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.208
Wait! Don't erase it. Hold on.

31
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:05.125
Are you interested in an internship?

32
00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:09.833
-Coffee with milk. in a glass. of course.
-In a mug. it's a cardinal sin. son.

33
00:03:09.916 --> 00:03:10.791
And your water.

34
00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:12.166
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

35
00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:50.208
-It has nothing to do with religion--
-I'm sorry. I had a small problem.

36
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.958
-Hello.
-This is Pablo Marimón.

37
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:57.333
-He only believes in science.
-I'm Gerardo Plana's student. A pleasure.

38
00:04:57.416 --> 00:05:00.041
Great. He flakes
and sends us a skeptic. Wonderful.

39
00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:04.916
No. I'm very interested in parapsychology
from a scientific standpoint. of course.

40
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.958
but I've read all your books
and listen to your show every week. ma'am.

41
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:11.250
-Every Saturday?
-Indeed.

42
00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:15.666
You should be partying Saturday nights.
You're only in your twenties once.

43
00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:19.333
And that's the last time
you call me "ma'am." Is that clear?

44
00:05:19.416 --> 00:05:20.625
-Yes. madam.
-Good.

45
00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:23.250
Lime blossom tea. Double.

46
00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.541
Just how you like it.

47
00:05:29.916 --> 00:05:31.708
Here. take the glass away.

48
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:37.583
What's wrong?

49
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:44.208
He tried to contact me.

50
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.291
A picture of him fell.
and the room was very cold.

51
00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:51.333
How long will you let the past
rob you of the present?

52
00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.666
Well. where are those two?

53
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.000
Look. I'll bet my tea
that Paz cancels because of her grandkids.

54
00:05:58.083 --> 00:06:03.875
The eyes of a toad. the legs of a frog…
Grandma will catch you and eat your face!

55
00:06:04.666 --> 00:06:06.541
Hold on.

56
00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:09.208
Leave me be. Leave Grammy be.

57
00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:11.250
Leave Grammy be.

58
00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:13.541
Leave Grammy be.

59
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:15.916
What is it. honey?

60
00:06:16.416 --> 00:06:19.041
It's getting late.
and you want them to stay for dinner.

61
00:06:19.583 --> 00:06:21.541
Because I'm a psychic. of course.

62
00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:24.208
And what should I do?
Leave them here alone?

63
00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:26.208
Fine.

64
00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:28.791
Give 'em an inch. and they'll take a mile.

65
00:06:29.291 --> 00:06:31.291
Quiet. Grammy can't hear!

66
00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:34.208
-Up!
-Right.

67
00:06:36.208 --> 00:06:38.791
What was that? No. you sweep.

68
00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:40.791
-Okay. bye.
-See you later.

69
00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:42.625
Father…

70
00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:46.208
you owe me this tea.

71
00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:47.125
Well…

72
00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:52.500
With my first paycheck.
I'm going to buy one of these.

73
00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:56.541
Didn't Gerardo tell you
that our work is altruistic?

74
00:06:57.666 --> 00:06:59.708
If not for money. why do you do it?

75
00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:03.500
To help those in need.
That's the best form of compensation.

76
00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:06.375
And you. ma'am?

77
00:07:08.625 --> 00:07:10.000
No. sorry.

78
00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:13.500
Why did you join the group?

79
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.625
Carlos liked everything
related to the paranormal.

80
00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:27.583
so we agreed that when one of us died.
we'd do the same as Houdini.

81
00:07:27.666 --> 00:07:28.500
Houdini?

82
00:07:28.583 --> 00:07:32.250
He promised his wife that if there was
an afterlife. he'd return to tell her.

83
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.041
-How?
-He invented a code.

84
00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:37.958
Ten words that only he and his wife knew.

85
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:42.000
When Houdini died. his wife visited
many mediums but was never successful.

86
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.833
Of course.

87
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.166
You can't waste your life chasing a ghost.

88
00:07:49.458 --> 00:07:52.250
-Okay. So tell us what this is about.
-Oh. right.

89
00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:54.958
It's an antique shop. It's near here.

90
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.208
-And this?
-That's from ten years ago.

91
00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:00.166
He never confessed.
but two neighbors witnessed everything.

92
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.458
A violent death.

93
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:05.250
A few days ago. the shop owner called me.
He was very agitated.

94
00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:09.333
It was nothing out of the ordinary.
Noises. furniture moving by itself…

95
00:08:09.416 --> 00:08:11.875
If it's the usual story.
what's the urgency?

96
00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.625
Because when I swung the pendulum
over the floor plan of the antique shop.

97
00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:17.625
it flew out of my hand.

98
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:22.875
Civil servant. anthropologist.
psychologist. and a PhD in Paris.

99
00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:24.750
Sure thing.

100
00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:28.416
You also own a pharmacy. don't you?

101
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:34.708
You must find a civil servant
the most boring thing in the world.

102
00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:37.333
I long for a boring life.

103
00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:42.500
You're so beautiful.
you must have many suitors.

104
00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:45.000
You don't look so bad yourself.

105
00:08:46.583 --> 00:08:49.250
And you haven't had
a girlfriend since your wife died?

106
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:54.208
-I'm single.
-Death is part of life.

107
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:57.000
I told you I'm single.
That's what the agency's file says.

108
00:08:57.083 --> 00:08:58.541
My mistake. I'm sorry.

109
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.250
You do look familiar.

110
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:04.541
-I've seen you on TV.
-No.

111
00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.666
-You're that psychic!
-Yes. but it's fine.

112
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.875
-This is so creepy.
-No. besides. I'm quitting.

113
00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.666
I'm going to just focus exclusively
on my pharmacy.

114
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.833
I'm going to become a pharmacist.

115
00:09:27.666 --> 00:09:30.916
Excuse me. Gloria called.
She's not feeling well.

116
00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:33.833
Well. whatever. Let's go home.

117
00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:37.041
I get off work in half an hour.

118
00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:41.083
If you feel like it.
we could go for a drink…

119
00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:42.916
Me? No. I can't.

120
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.083
Right.

121
00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:46.500
Okay. of course. No problem.

122
00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:50.875
Change seasons. or there will be no end
to the winter that lives in your heart.

123
00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:53.708
-The Bible. right?
-A song by Alaska y Dinarama.

124
00:09:55.083 --> 00:09:57.791
So. we're not going ghost hunting?

125
00:09:57.875 --> 00:09:59.708
It'd be a waste of time without her.

126
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.750
TEMPLE AUCTION HOUSE

127
00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:14.916
SUPERINTENDENT

128
00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:16.875
Coming!

129
00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:18.916
Coming.

130
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.833
ANTIQUE SHOP

131
00:11:19.916 --> 00:11:21.000
One moment.

132
00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.375
-Good evening. Hello.
-Hello.

133
00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:27.458
I came to…

134
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.958
Oh. yes. they left a while ago.

135
00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:32.458
I'll come back another day.

136
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:35.750
They close earlier each day. you know?
Since there are no customers…

137
00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:39.708
This morning one of them ran out of here.
Looked like the police were chasing him.

138
00:11:40.208 --> 00:11:41.666
The poor man peed himself.

139
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.500
Have you been the super for a while?

140
00:11:44.583 --> 00:11:47.083
My husband and I came here
when we were very young.

141
00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:50.000
-Don't you know what happened here?
-You mean the murder.

142
00:11:50.083 --> 00:11:53.916
Yes. The man they killed was
my husband. Poor thing.

143
00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:56.541
And I was left alone with our daughter.

144
00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:59.041
-I'm sorry for your loss.
-Well…

145
00:12:00.291 --> 00:12:02.541
If you want. I have the keys to that door.

146
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.041
-If it's okay with you…
-I trust you. sir. You're a priest.

147
00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:08.375
I see you a lot on TV.

148
00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:35.833
If you don't mind. leave the keys here
in the super's mailbox when you're done.

149
00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:37.958
-Don't worry. Thanks.
-God bless you.

150
00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:43.833
In the mid-1980s. Pilón formed
an interdisciplinary research group

151
00:15:43.916 --> 00:15:46.791
to study all kinds
of paranormal phenomena.

152
00:15:46.875 --> 00:15:51.791
…"medium" because it is a concept
that combines the other two.

153
00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:56.750
which are clairvoyance. the ability
to see across time. and telepathy.

154
00:15:56.833 --> 00:16:00.916
Four minutes is the limit
that I can do an incorporation for.

155
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.875
It's the limit because if she goes longer.
she risks not coming back.

156
00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.666
Yes. because when she goes into a trance.

157
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:10.166
the spirit of the deceased occupies
Gloria's body.

158
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.833
-Luckily. they're always peaceful.
-And polite too.

159
00:16:13.916 --> 00:16:17.208
One of the most popular cases
was that of the Vergara Palace.

160
00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:19.625
which made headlines at the time.

161
00:16:19.708 --> 00:16:23.583
The EVPs found there
became famous all over the country.

162
00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:25.791
Tell them about Vergara.

163
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:27.750
Why not. right?

164
00:16:28.625 --> 00:16:31.291
Sorry. cut. I'm sorry. Just a moment.

165
00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:35.125
Listen carefully at home
to the following audio clip.

166
00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:38.416
I only need three.

167
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.166
I only need three.

168
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.750
I only need three.

169
00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:48.083
There was an abnormal reaction
that we verified with all our instruments.

170
00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:51.291
And our medium. Gloria…

171
00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:54.458
Is it true she was unconscious
for several minutes?

172
00:16:54.541 --> 00:16:57.125
Let's just say it was a very tough case.

173
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Well. we wish Father Pilón
a speedy recovery.

174
00:17:03.083 --> 00:17:06.208
who. by the way.
has not visited us for a long time.

175
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:08.708
And now the weather forecast
for this weekend.

176
00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:12.833
Heavy thunderstorms are expected
throughout the Iberian Peninsula…

177
00:17:12.916 --> 00:17:15.625
These people…
They're already sending him to the grave.

178
00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.125
They had to talk about the Vergara Palace.

179
00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:22.041
Hello.

180
00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:32.208
How is he?

181
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.750
There must have been something serious
in there for him to end up like this.

182
00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:43.041
Please! He drank ten coffees a day
and never slept more than three hours.

183
00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:45.500
No. yesterday he looked fine.

184
00:17:45.583 --> 00:17:47.833
Health is not valued till sickness comes.

185
00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:49.250
Why did you let him go alone?

186
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.500
Well. at least I was at the meeting.

187
00:17:53.416 --> 00:17:55.458
What. a person can't get sick anymore?

188
00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:56.958
-Sick?
-Yes. sick.

189
00:17:57.041 --> 00:17:58.041
Did you say "sick"?

190
00:17:58.125 --> 00:18:00.541
-Yes.
-Yes. of course. sick.

191
00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:04.791
Why didn't he follow protocol?
We investigate as a team.

192
00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:08.958
He said he had a hunch and was worried.
And he was in a hurry. You know him.

193
00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:11.166
But he never said
he was going to go alone.

194
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.375
At no point. Why?

195
00:18:13.458 --> 00:18:16.583
-What are you making?
-A blanket to keep him warm.

196
00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:19.625
What's going on here?
Only one visitor is allowed.

197
00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:23.208
Is that so?
Well. this place is full of people.

198
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:27.791
And there's a lady who says
she's going to sue you for negligence.

199
00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.458
No one here is a patient of mine.

200
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:33.166
She says she came here
with a tumor the size of a potato.

201
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.041
and you prescribed her a laxative.

202
00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:38.541
Poor thing. She died two days later.

203
00:18:39.833 --> 00:18:41.708
Everybody out. come on!

204
00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:43.500
-Now! Get out! Get your things.
-Easy.

205
00:18:43.583 --> 00:18:46.041
-Can I finish this row?
-Do it outside! Come on!

206
00:19:56.541 --> 00:19:58.166
You have to be strong. my child.

207
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.833
Why?

208
00:20:30.708 --> 00:20:33.083
The ball. I left it behind.

209
00:20:37.416 --> 00:20:38.250
What?

210
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.083
We need to find out what happened.

211
00:20:42.791 --> 00:20:44.666
TOBACCO SHOP

212
00:21:03.875 --> 00:21:06.375
-Where's Gerardo?
-He stayed with Father Pilón.

213
00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:08.291
Hi. How are you?

214
00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:10.250
Close it. damn it. We're getting wet.

215
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.416
What happened is not normal.

216
00:21:14.083 --> 00:21:17.791
Oh. please. Let's not get carried away.
He's old and smokes like a chimney.

217
00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:20.375
Let's stick to the protocol
and see what we find.

218
00:21:20.458 --> 00:21:21.291
What protocol?

219
00:21:23.083 --> 00:21:28.166
When investigating paranormal phenomena.
you must first rule out normal phenomena.

220
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.958
Sure. that's why you have to check to see
if the conditions are considered normal.

221
00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:35.541
The phenomenon can't be something
the laws of physics can explain.

222
00:21:35.625 --> 00:21:38.250
And that's where you
and your little gadgets come in.

223
00:21:38.875 --> 00:21:41.333
Most of the time.
when something inexplicable happens.

224
00:21:41.416 --> 00:21:44.250
it's because there's an entity
trapped in the interphase.

225
00:21:44.833 --> 00:21:45.875
Wait a minute.

226
00:21:46.458 --> 00:21:50.375
The brain is the neuroanatomical substrate
that houses consciousness.

227
00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:54.791
When it stops working. there is
no consciousness at all. obviously.

228
00:21:55.708 --> 00:21:56.750
I love this kid.

229
00:21:56.833 --> 00:21:58.750
This one is Gerardo's. Take it.

230
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.333
Open it.

231
00:22:00.416 --> 00:22:03.208
In the 16th century.
there was a rectory on this land.

232
00:22:03.291 --> 00:22:05.416
In 1538. there was a fire.

233
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.541
There was absolutely nothing left.

234
00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:09.958
and the land was bought
by an Italian merchant.

235
00:22:10.916 --> 00:22:14.083
He built a house
that stayed in his family for centuries.

236
00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:17.750
In 1989. the basement tenant
killed a neighbor with a hammer.

237
00:22:17.833 --> 00:22:18.791
Holy Jesus!

238
00:22:18.875 --> 00:22:22.416
If he got stuck in the interphase.
he must've been in a very bad mood.

239
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.000
In the interphase. sure.

240
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.333
Don't worry.

241
00:22:25.416 --> 00:22:26.916
Most of the time.

242
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.666
these phenomena are poltergeists
caused by people who live in the house.

243
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.583
-The dead aren't violent.
-The violent ones are the living.

244
00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:35.791
They throw things.
but we've never been hit.

245
00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:37.833
They only do it to get attention.

246
00:22:41.166 --> 00:22:43.458
Whatever happens. stay calm.

247
00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:46.708
Look. if you're lucky enough
to see Gloria contact one of them.

248
00:22:46.791 --> 00:22:48.375
your mind will open in no time.

249
00:22:48.458 --> 00:22:50.833
Seeing her in a trance is quite the show.

250
00:22:50.916 --> 00:22:52.916
-Was that a compliment?
-Trances do you well.

251
00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:55.541
Stop! It's here!

252
00:22:57.708 --> 00:22:58.541
Damn it.

253
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.916
Look at this rain.

254
00:23:02.416 --> 00:23:03.708
Unbelievable.

255
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.666
-Is that okay?
-Incredible!

256
00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:25.791
THEATER

257
00:23:25.875 --> 00:23:27.458
-Hey. do you smoke?
-No.

258
00:23:28.041 --> 00:23:29.750
Youngsters are so boring!

259
00:23:34.916 --> 00:23:36.000
Come on. let's go.

260
00:23:44.166 --> 00:23:45.166
Nice to meet you.

261
00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:48.208
I'm Enrique. This is my wife. Marisa.

262
00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:50.291
-Hello. a pleasure. I'm Sagrario.
-Hello.

263
00:23:50.375 --> 00:23:53.208
-Yes. Ruiz de Carvajal. I know you.
-Of course.

264
00:23:53.291 --> 00:23:57.333
Wow. it's Palomeque. Unbelievable!
Being a clairvoyant must be amazing!

265
00:23:57.833 --> 00:24:00.416
I prefer to call myself a "medium."

266
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.583
-"Medium." that's beautiful.
-This is Paz.

267
00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:04.333
I don't know you.

268
00:24:04.416 --> 00:24:06.916
Of course not. I do the audiovisual work.

269
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.875
Sure.

270
00:24:07.958 --> 00:24:09.583
-This is Pablo. our physicist.
-Hi.

271
00:24:09.666 --> 00:24:11.041
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

272
00:24:11.125 --> 00:24:14.500
-You're young for a physicist. aren't you?
-Yes. I'm still studying.

273
00:24:15.125 --> 00:24:18.750
Sagrario. excuse me. I mean.
excuse me. ma'am. How's Father Pilón?

274
00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:23.250
-Very bad. He's still in the hospital.
-Poor man…

275
00:24:23.333 --> 00:24:25.541
-Poor man. What a shock.
-Yes.

276
00:24:25.625 --> 00:24:28.500
Well. to be honest. when I saw him.
I was very excited.

277
00:24:28.583 --> 00:24:29.416
Excited?

278
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.583
Yes. I'm a big fan of his.

279
00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:36.541
It's called "alopecia areata."

280
00:24:36.625 --> 00:24:39.250
He lost both eyebrows suddenly.

281
00:24:39.333 --> 00:24:40.166
From stress.

282
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.666
I draw them on.
but he says he looks like La Veneno.

283
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.916
-Shall we go in and talk specifics?
-Sure.

284
00:24:47.083 --> 00:24:50.583
Your hands are full.
and you're getting wet. Come in.

285
00:24:50.666 --> 00:24:52.083
At least. you know…

286
00:24:52.166 --> 00:24:53.833
-Got everything?
-Can I help you?

287
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.541
Hello.

288
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.791
What's your name. sweetheart?

289
00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:02.083
Cheer up.

290
00:25:02.583 --> 00:25:04.416
There's no beauty without happiness.

291
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.500
-Who made these pretty pompoms for you?
-Susanita. don't bother the nice people.

292
00:25:08.583 --> 00:25:10.250
She's not bothering anyone.

293
00:25:10.333 --> 00:25:13.291
Hello. Can I make you
a cup of coffee or something?

294
00:25:14.708 --> 00:25:17.666
-I've made some delicious torrijas. No?
-No. we're fine. really.

295
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.666
-Thanks very much.
-Let's go.

296
00:25:20.666 --> 00:25:24.083
The super. she's being too kind.
This way. please.

297
00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:25.958
Thank you. Chimichurri.

298
00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:30.166
When we moved in.
we started to hear strange noises.

299
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.708
Nothing unusual. This is an antique shop.
It's full of antique furniture.

300
00:25:33.791 --> 00:25:35.666
That's what I said at the beginning.

301
00:25:36.583 --> 00:25:37.416
Look.

302
00:25:38.208 --> 00:25:39.750
See that candelabra?

303
00:25:39.833 --> 00:25:41.291
One day it lit itself.

304
00:25:45.333 --> 00:25:50.625
Yes. sometimes contact
with air or water is more than enough

305
00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:53.000
to cause spontaneous combustion.

306
00:25:53.083 --> 00:25:55.000
It wouldn't be the first time.

307
00:25:58.916 --> 00:26:02.833
When there's paranormal activity.
the temperature drops considerably. right?

308
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.583
Sure. And when you don't turn on
the heater too. right?

309
00:26:12.666 --> 00:26:16.083
-It costs a fortune to heat this place.
-Let's see. Just a moment.

310
00:26:16.166 --> 00:26:17.375
We don't charge a penny.

311
00:26:17.958 --> 00:26:21.833
In the spirit dimension.
energy vibrations are higher than in ours.

312
00:26:21.916 --> 00:26:24.166
They use a lot of energy
when they come down here.

313
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.541
Thermal energy.
That's why the temperature drops.

314
00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:28.166
-Cold.
-They absorb heat.

315
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.916
-Sure.
-I don't believe in ghosts.

316
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.333
But… what's going on here is not normal.

317
00:26:33.416 --> 00:26:36.083
Okay. there's an explanation
for everything.

318
00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:38.500
Yes. I used to think like you. but…

319
00:26:40.958 --> 00:26:42.583
Will you excuse me for a moment?

320
00:26:44.833 --> 00:26:48.833
It fell on top of this sculpture.
which was sold and ready to be packed.

321
00:26:49.333 --> 00:26:52.000
-And the mirror remained intact.
-Fascinating. right?

322
00:26:52.083 --> 00:26:54.833
Landlords often do these things
to kick tenants out.

323
00:26:54.916 --> 00:26:57.291
-We own the shop.
-Really?

324
00:26:57.375 --> 00:26:58.208
-Yes.
-Yes.

325
00:26:58.291 --> 00:26:59.750
Well. I wasn't aware of that.

326
00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:03.500
-We bought it two months ago.
-We're up to our eyebrows in debt.

327
00:27:04.875 --> 00:27:07.416
Don't worry.
We'll find out what's going on here.

328
00:27:07.958 --> 00:27:09.416
Well. I don't sense anything.

329
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.750
Aside from

330
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:15.541
a terrible smell…

331
00:27:17.958 --> 00:27:20.000
-He suffers from hyperhidrosis.
-Hyper what?

332
00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:23.166
Hyperhidrosis.
abnormal and excessive sweating.

333
00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:25.208
There's a lot going on…

334
00:27:31.958 --> 00:27:34.125
-Let's take the measurements. Pablo?
-Yes.

335
00:27:34.208 --> 00:27:37.625
-He'll measure the magnetic field.
-I know how it works. Right. Chimichurri?

336
00:27:37.708 --> 00:27:39.250
I'm a fan of Jiménez del Oso.

337
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.625
-And I listen to your show every week.
-Mine?

338
00:27:42.708 --> 00:27:45.541
Congratulations. you have two listeners.
Her and your cousin.

339
00:27:45.625 --> 00:27:46.458
Very funny.

340
00:27:46.541 --> 00:27:49.416
Now I'm going to ask you
for a moment of silence. please.

341
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.291
-All ready. Let's go.
-Gloria.

342
00:27:52.791 --> 00:27:53.666
Here I go.

343
00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:12.875
This…

344
00:28:13.916 --> 00:28:15.958
This is clean. Better luck next time.

345
00:28:19.625 --> 00:28:22.291
-What's the matter with you?
-It's clean. and I have dinner plans.

346
00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:25.208
-It's clean because of your dinner plans.
-No!

347
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.125
Father Pilón had an intuition.
and look how he ended up.

348
00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:32.166
Father Pilón had a stroke. that's all.

349
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:35.375
Things happen in life
that have no supernatural explanation.

350
00:28:35.458 --> 00:28:37.833
I don't know why it bothers you so much.

351
00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:41.208
Why? Haven't you heard
what's going on here? Come on!

352
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.041
But have you seen
how nervous the owner is?

353
00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:45.333
You're so sure about it.

354
00:28:45.416 --> 00:28:48.375
I am sure it's his unbridled mind
that causes everything.

355
00:28:48.458 --> 00:28:49.458
Have a look at this.

356
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.541
This doll appeared
just like that. suddenly.

357
00:28:53.625 --> 00:28:55.375
We found it there. Come with me.

358
00:28:55.875 --> 00:28:56.791
In that room.

359
00:28:57.375 --> 00:28:58.208
Like this.

360
00:28:58.958 --> 00:28:59.833
With no body.

361
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.833
No. I'm leaving.

362
00:29:04.916 --> 00:29:09.375
Father Pilón would never abandon
someone who needed help.

363
00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:12.333
Do what you want.

364
00:29:16.416 --> 00:29:18.291
She is so manipulative.

365
00:29:20.208 --> 00:29:21.500
May I take some samples?

366
00:29:21.583 --> 00:29:24.000
-Of course. whatever you need.
-Thank you.

367
00:29:24.083 --> 00:29:25.500
-We'd never seen it before.
-No!

368
00:29:25.583 --> 00:29:27.333
With all the stuff you have here--

369
00:29:27.416 --> 00:29:30.500
Gloria will get her ball
and tell us if anything else is going on.

370
00:29:30.583 --> 00:29:31.958
-Her ball?
-Great!

371
00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:34.166
As the lady commands.

372
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.250
Gloria uses the ball
as a bridge between their world and ours.

373
00:29:40.333 --> 00:29:41.791
-Holy shit.
-Ready. Gloria?

374
00:29:42.958 --> 00:29:45.708
After Paz's rally driving.
I must've dropped it in the van.

375
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:48.000
You can walk home.
It's great weather for ducks.

376
00:29:48.083 --> 00:29:50.416
-I'll take your keys.
-Many things disappear here.

377
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.750
It's true. The account book.
the keys. an embalmed glass eye…

378
00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:54.791
I'll be right back.

379
00:29:54.875 --> 00:29:56.916
-All kinds of objects.
-Yes.

380
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.083
I bet my earrings the ball is in her bag.

381
00:29:59.166 --> 00:30:00.125
I have it!

382
00:30:00.958 --> 00:30:02.083
I have it.

383
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.125
It was in my bag.

384
00:30:04.208 --> 00:30:06.500
Well. let's continue. Silence.

385
00:30:13.791 --> 00:30:14.625
Was that you?

386
00:30:15.125 --> 00:30:16.458
Me? No.

387
00:30:20.666 --> 00:30:25.166
Okay. whenever someone makes a noise.
raise your hand and say. "It was me."

388
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:28.833
Gloria. this isn't
one of your jokes. is it?

389
00:30:28.916 --> 00:30:32.500
I have a date.
Do you remember what that is?

390
00:30:32.583 --> 00:30:34.416
It's what you do right before--

391
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.833
Fuck.

392
00:30:42.875 --> 00:30:44.916
It's coming from there. Yes.

393
00:30:46.333 --> 00:30:47.250
Film it. Paz.

394
00:30:50.541 --> 00:30:51.708
It came from here. yes.

395
00:31:02.125 --> 00:31:02.958
Water stains.

396
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.666
And we thought "Chimichurri" was bad…

397
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:12.375
Well. this is normal. There can be leaks
in the plumbing in these buildings.

398
00:31:12.458 --> 00:31:15.333
This… wasn't like this before.

399
00:31:15.958 --> 00:31:18.208
-What did you say?
-Why would you notice?

400
00:31:18.291 --> 00:31:20.833
No. Enrique takes pictures before we leave

401
00:31:20.916 --> 00:31:23.125
to make sure
it's all the same the next day.

402
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:26.375
It can't be.

403
00:31:32.458 --> 00:31:33.291
What is it?

404
00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:37.625
NOVEMBER 21. 1998

405
00:31:42.666 --> 00:31:43.500
Of course.

406
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.458
-And not even six people could move this.
-No.

407
00:31:47.541 --> 00:31:49.833
Do you think it could be a psi field?

408
00:31:49.916 --> 00:31:50.750
Elohim?

409
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.583
Geoecia. heloclasty. pandemonium?
Or just a Kamparupa?

410
00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:55.750
-Marisa.
-What?

411
00:31:57.125 --> 00:31:58.833
-Calm down.
-Look.

412
00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:01.541
This is where I found Father Pilón.

413
00:32:02.375 --> 00:32:03.208
Sprawled out…

414
00:32:04.375 --> 00:32:05.250
Right here?

415
00:32:06.083 --> 00:32:07.208
It's no coincidence.

416
00:32:10.708 --> 00:32:12.250
One moment. please.

417
00:32:15.208 --> 00:32:16.750
Wow. that's amazing.

418
00:32:16.833 --> 00:32:18.625
Let me through. please.

419
00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:20.125
Make it stop. please!

420
00:32:20.833 --> 00:32:22.833
-I already sold it.
-Wow. that's amazing.

421
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.541
-That was me.
-Pablo.

422
00:32:25.625 --> 00:32:27.166
Yes. just a sec.

423
00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:35.041
-This is impossible.
-What?

424
00:32:36.458 --> 00:32:37.541
What?

425
00:32:37.625 --> 00:32:38.750
-What is it?
-Look.

426
00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:41.583
It can't be.

427
00:32:41.666 --> 00:32:43.083
-This must be wrong…
-Eighteen?

428
00:32:43.166 --> 00:32:46.041
The normal magnetic field in Madrid is 35.

429
00:32:46.125 --> 00:32:48.000
Don't you suffer from headaches?

430
00:32:48.083 --> 00:32:50.791
Now that you mention it.
I do have a terrible migraine.

431
00:32:50.875 --> 00:32:53.916
Relax. That must be because
there's an iron beam. As soon as--

432
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.375
Or… it could be a gateway.
They come in through there.

433
00:33:06.041 --> 00:33:07.041
Oh my God.

434
00:33:08.041 --> 00:33:11.208
This is a poltergeist caused by someone.

435
00:33:11.291 --> 00:33:13.208
-You think so?
-For God's sake.

436
00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:15.375
The mind cannot move physical objects.

437
00:33:15.458 --> 00:33:17.333
It can't? It's called psychorragy.

438
00:33:17.416 --> 00:33:21.875
It's a spurt of mental energy that acts
on matter in situations of great stress.

439
00:33:22.375 --> 00:33:24.833
And there are quite a few nerves here.

440
00:33:26.583 --> 00:33:29.375
No. don't blame me.
I'll tell you something…

441
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:36.375
Come on.

442
00:33:37.291 --> 00:33:40.375
-The living didn't cause this.
-Don't underestimate La Veneno.

443
00:33:40.458 --> 00:33:42.041
Enrique? Impossible.

444
00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:45.583
If he can't do simple math.
how could he move things with his mind?

445
00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:50.000
When you say "gateway."
do you mean one end

446
00:33:50.083 --> 00:33:52.583
of a Rosen-Einstein bridge
or a space-time channel…

447
00:33:55.666 --> 00:33:57.166
Honey. I'm not that ugly.

448
00:33:57.666 --> 00:33:59.000
-Paz!
-My camera!

449
00:33:59.583 --> 00:34:01.416
Holy moly!

450
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.125
Good aim.

451
00:34:05.208 --> 00:34:07.750
-Did you film it?
-I think so. It might be broken.

452
00:34:07.833 --> 00:34:11.208
-Pablo. bring a chair for Paz.
-Wow. that was quite the shot!

453
00:34:12.375 --> 00:34:13.208
Here. Paz.

454
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.833
Let's see.

455
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:16.958
Come and see. Pablo.

456
00:34:18.791 --> 00:34:19.916
Stay calm.

457
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.833
Stay calm.

458
00:34:23.916 --> 00:34:25.333
Are you all right? Marisa?

459
00:34:35.208 --> 00:34:37.583
-You're sure you're okay?
-Yes. it missed.

460
00:34:37.666 --> 00:34:41.208
-Well. it could have cut your arm off.
-Well. I'm perfectly fine.

461
00:34:41.291 --> 00:34:44.333
-Did you see how fast it fell?
-They weren't aiming.

462
00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:46.833
What? There's more than one?

463
00:34:46.916 --> 00:34:49.625
Please calm down.
That doesn't do us any good.

464
00:34:49.708 --> 00:34:52.500
Fortune favors the brave.

465
00:34:52.583 --> 00:34:55.250
Specters are like dogs.
They smell fear a mile away.

466
00:34:55.333 --> 00:34:56.791
-Don't say that. Paz!
-Relax.

467
00:34:56.875 --> 00:34:59.875
-Yes. I'm very relaxed.
-Tell me you got something.

468
00:34:59.958 --> 00:35:01.208
Look. here it is.

469
00:35:02.875 --> 00:35:06.791
-Looks like it's been freshly sharpened.
-But didn't you say it didn't hit you?

470
00:35:06.875 --> 00:35:09.666
-Well. I wasn't really hit.
-Marisina. please…

471
00:35:10.166 --> 00:35:13.250
-It was just a warning.
-Yes? Message received. We're leaving.

472
00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:16.500
What? Are you crazy?
Things are just getting interesting.

473
00:35:16.583 --> 00:35:18.375
I'm not feeling well!

474
00:35:18.458 --> 00:35:23.166
Marisa. please take him outside
for five minutes to get some fresh air.

475
00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:24.750
Honey. I'm not that ugly.

476
00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:26.625
Look.

477
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:28.166
-They were aiming.
-"They"?

478
00:35:28.708 --> 00:35:32.916
Yes. I mean the energies.
Enrique is a very powerful energy source.

479
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.166
-You learn fast.
-Excuse me. Have you seen my ball?

480
00:35:36.916 --> 00:35:39.500
-You are paranormal.
-Last time I saw it was in the other room.

481
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.833
It is a uniformly
accelerated rectilinear motion

482
00:35:49.916 --> 00:35:51.291
modified by gravitation.

483
00:35:51.375 --> 00:35:53.416
I don't know. I would need to calculate.

484
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.083
Could I rewind?

485
00:35:55.166 --> 00:35:56.708
Sure. Wait. I'll do it.

486
00:35:57.208 --> 00:35:58.416
Here. this is yours.

487
00:36:00.083 --> 00:36:02.208
-Has the battery died?
-Get the spare ones.

488
00:36:02.291 --> 00:36:03.875
-What spare ones?
-Very good. kid.

489
00:36:03.958 --> 00:36:06.875
We'll have to plug into
this modern power grid.

490
00:36:06.958 --> 00:36:10.125
You don't need machines to know
that something is going on here.

491
00:36:12.666 --> 00:36:14.166
And it's something very big.

492
00:36:20.958 --> 00:36:23.875
How beautiful.
My first Ouija. So exciting.

493
00:36:23.958 --> 00:36:25.333
Can you take a photo of me?

494
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:28.125
Don't be a killjoy. Take a photo of me.

495
00:36:32.375 --> 00:36:35.125
-Okay. sit here.
-No. There are already a lot of us.

496
00:36:35.208 --> 00:36:37.958
Look. Ouija is not a game. please.

497
00:36:38.041 --> 00:36:41.958
And it can be dangerous for
emotionally weak people.

498
00:36:42.041 --> 00:36:44.541
-You mean me?
-Not at all.

499
00:36:44.625 --> 00:36:46.916
Sit down. We could use
some masculine energy.

500
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.291
No. thank you.

501
00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:51.583
I'd rather stay there. keeping watch.

502
00:36:51.666 --> 00:36:56.083
I have plenty
of masculine energy to spare.

503
00:36:56.833 --> 00:37:00.041
-Pablo. I'll notice if you cheat.
-You'd better.

504
00:37:01.208 --> 00:37:03.208
I ask for strength…

505
00:37:11.916 --> 00:37:12.750
Look.

506
00:37:17.583 --> 00:37:19.875
So pretty. I love the blouse.

507
00:37:20.416 --> 00:37:21.250
What?

508
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.875
Is this safe?

509
00:37:24.958 --> 00:37:26.875
If you know what you're doing.

510
00:37:26.958 --> 00:37:28.541
Gloria is a phenomenon.

511
00:37:28.625 --> 00:37:31.125
-Two compliments in one day?
-Don't get used to it.

512
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:33.208
Come on. I have a date.

513
00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:34.833
Hands.

514
00:37:38.166 --> 00:37:39.666
-Marisa. calm down.
-Okay.

515
00:37:41.583 --> 00:37:42.416
Hands.

516
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.333
The other one.

517
00:37:48.958 --> 00:37:49.916
Get it together.

518
00:37:54.666 --> 00:37:55.708
Are you there?

519
00:37:56.958 --> 00:37:59.958
Come on. please.
A minute ago. you weren't that shy.

520
00:38:00.041 --> 00:38:01.458
Watch your tone!

521
00:38:01.541 --> 00:38:03.875
Who are you? We're here to help you.

522
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.166
Well. this is unbelievable.

523
00:38:21.291 --> 00:38:22.916
Can you stay still. please?

524
00:38:23.583 --> 00:38:24.833
Sorry. Of course.

525
00:38:24.916 --> 00:38:27.083
I'm Gloria. You can trust me.

526
00:38:29.375 --> 00:38:30.375
There it is.

527
00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:33.125
I'm glad you're with us.

528
00:38:33.208 --> 00:38:34.583
Tell me who you are.

529
00:38:40.416 --> 00:38:41.416
"Q."

530
00:38:45.208 --> 00:38:46.208
"U."

531
00:38:47.208 --> 00:38:48.041
"I."

532
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.333
"M."

533
00:38:51.916 --> 00:38:53.250
-"I."
-Quimi.

534
00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:55.375
Quimi. do you live here now?

535
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.541
-Yes.
-Marisa. lift your finger.

536
00:39:02.791 --> 00:39:04.708
-Why?
-Lift it.

537
00:39:25.458 --> 00:39:26.916
OUIJA - YES - NO - FAREWELL

538
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
-Gloria. I swear I'm not doing anything.
-Now.

539
00:39:51.541 --> 00:39:53.250
You can't leave the room now.

540
00:39:57.458 --> 00:39:59.833
Quimi. are you bothered by our presence?

541
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.458
Are you bothered by Enrique and Marisa?

542
00:40:07.041 --> 00:40:09.541
Quimi. do you want
Enrique and Marisa to leave?

543
00:40:09.625 --> 00:40:11.375
No need to insist that much. is there?

544
00:40:15.333 --> 00:40:17.333
Merde. I won't make it to dinner.

545
00:40:23.458 --> 00:40:24.416
Relax.

546
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:25.791
It was the rain--

547
00:40:41.916 --> 00:40:42.750
See?

548
00:40:43.375 --> 00:40:46.208
This is not Quimi.
This one is more of a bastard.

549
00:40:47.083 --> 00:40:48.291
Fuck!

550
00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:54.666
Pablo. the flashlight.

551
00:40:55.166 --> 00:40:56.250
-Flashlight.
-Come on!

552
00:40:56.333 --> 00:40:57.791
Next to the tools. Come on.

553
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.541
-Sorry. it was me!
-Light!

554
00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:03.875
-I hit the chair.
-Everyone calm down. okay?

555
00:41:34.958 --> 00:41:37.041
Chimichurri. honey. you scared me.

556
00:41:42.583 --> 00:41:43.708
Are you Enrique?

557
00:41:51.791 --> 00:41:52.666
Holy shit!

558
00:42:54.625 --> 00:42:56.083
We have to hold him. Come on.

559
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:58.875
Come on.

560
00:42:58.958 --> 00:43:00.833
-Come on.
-I can't!

561
00:43:00.916 --> 00:43:01.750
Come on!

562
00:43:05.958 --> 00:43:07.625
Hold him back!

563
00:43:08.958 --> 00:43:10.208
Hold on tight!

564
00:43:11.791 --> 00:43:12.791
Tighter!

565
00:43:17.291 --> 00:43:19.125
We're too old for this!

566
00:43:19.208 --> 00:43:20.250
Speak for yourself!

567
00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:29.833
-I'm three months younger than you.
-Yeah. sure.

568
00:43:30.375 --> 00:43:31.625
Did you hear that. Paz?

569
00:43:32.875 --> 00:43:33.875
Loud and clear.

570
00:43:37.583 --> 00:43:38.500
Watch out!

571
00:43:41.083 --> 00:43:42.333
Sweet Jesus!

572
00:43:44.541 --> 00:43:48.416
Enriquito! What have they done to you?

573
00:43:49.166 --> 00:43:50.500
Sweetheart!

574
00:43:51.583 --> 00:43:52.708
Are you all okay?

575
00:43:52.791 --> 00:43:55.750
-I think so. You? Yes?
-You okay? I'm fine. Everything okay?

576
00:43:59.791 --> 00:44:00.708
You're welcome.

577
00:44:43.875 --> 00:44:45.875
You shall all be judged.

578
00:44:47.916 --> 00:44:50.041
It can't be.

579
00:44:50.916 --> 00:44:51.875
It can't be.

580
00:44:55.208 --> 00:44:56.083
Are you okay?

581
00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:58.333
-I'm cold.
-I'll warm you up.

582
00:44:58.416 --> 00:45:00.291
Oh. Chimichurri. please…

583
00:45:00.375 --> 00:45:03.000
-My goodness.
-Chimichurri looks pretty rough.

584
00:45:03.083 --> 00:45:04.333
-Enrique!
-Are you okay?

585
00:45:04.416 --> 00:45:06.125
-Yes. Are you all right. Gloria?
-You?

586
00:45:06.208 --> 00:45:07.541
-Yes.
-You sure?

587
00:45:23.333 --> 00:45:24.583
It was amazing.

588
00:45:25.083 --> 00:45:27.125
Don't worry. We'll call you tomorrow.

589
00:45:27.208 --> 00:45:28.041
Take care.

590
00:45:38.125 --> 00:45:40.916
What a rush. huh? I'm like…

591
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.875
This is the first time I've seen Gloria
leave anyone alone at the Ouija board.

592
00:45:44.958 --> 00:45:45.791
-Really?
-Sure.

593
00:45:45.875 --> 00:45:48.125
Because I've never met
anyone like him before.

594
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.458
Listen. Pablo.

595
00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:59.833
As a kid. you always slept
with the light on. didn't you?

596
00:45:59.916 --> 00:46:01.833
Like every other kid. right?

597
00:46:02.916 --> 00:46:05.791
And when you sleep.
does it feel like someone is watching you?

598
00:46:10.291 --> 00:46:12.041
You have to learn to protect yourself.

599
00:46:12.625 --> 00:46:14.791
-Protect myself from what?
-From you. Pablo.

600
00:46:14.875 --> 00:46:17.208
Because this talent you have is a gift.

601
00:46:18.958 --> 00:46:22.791
But you have to control it.
not the other way around.

602
00:46:24.416 --> 00:46:28.541
-You've been of great help. Thank you.
-What? No. I can't leave now. Gloria.

603
00:46:28.625 --> 00:46:32.958
-I mean. I need to know how this ends.
-It would be too dangerous for you.

604
00:46:33.041 --> 00:46:35.375
Then help me. I'm sure you can--

605
00:46:35.458 --> 00:46:39.791
You now have many things to unlearn.

606
00:46:39.875 --> 00:46:40.708
Yes.

607
00:46:40.791 --> 00:46:44.416
And that requires time. Pablo.
Time we don't have right now.

608
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:48.000
Yes. Gloria. but I can unlearn.
Just as I learn. I can unlearn.

609
00:46:50.166 --> 00:46:51.250
Don't rush this.

610
00:47:01.333 --> 00:47:03.875
This has been the most amazing night
of my life. ladies.

611
00:47:03.958 --> 00:47:06.125
-Watch out. kiddo!
-Sorry.

612
00:47:07.833 --> 00:47:10.375
But seriously. you're fucking awesome.

613
00:47:10.458 --> 00:47:12.041
-Yes. we are.
-Yes.

614
00:47:23.416 --> 00:47:24.250
Be careful.

615
00:47:31.916 --> 00:47:33.208
My whole body hurts.

616
00:47:40.875 --> 00:47:42.208
Well. what's your problem?

617
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:51.750
I've put cameras
in all the rooms and in the hall.

618
00:47:51.833 --> 00:47:53.375
Let's see if we get something.

619
00:47:55.083 --> 00:47:56.333
What are you doing?

620
00:47:56.416 --> 00:47:58.708
Come on. It's just a knife.

621
00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:01.208
You're such a lowlife.

622
00:48:02.291 --> 00:48:03.291
Where's Sagrario?

623
00:48:03.875 --> 00:48:05.083
She's not doing so well.

624
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:07.750
Why?

625
00:48:07.833 --> 00:48:08.666
Guess.

626
00:48:10.041 --> 00:48:12.500
I hope she gets over it soon.
Please. what a drag.

627
00:48:15.666 --> 00:48:17.875
Do you have any idea
what might be happening?

628
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:21.333
No. The truth is I'm a bit lost.

629
00:48:21.416 --> 00:48:23.541
Did you get that on tape?
The lady is lost.

630
00:48:24.916 --> 00:48:27.708
Yes. I'm really confused about this.

631
00:48:28.375 --> 00:48:31.500
What if it was this Quimi
who hammered the neighbor to death?

632
00:48:31.583 --> 00:48:34.333
Impossible.
He said he's here. now. in 1998.

633
00:48:34.833 --> 00:48:36.541
And the crime was ten years ago.

634
00:48:37.666 --> 00:48:39.958
Trust me. There is something wrong here.

635
00:48:40.916 --> 00:48:43.708
Yes. I'm still in shock.
Thank you. The music…

636
00:48:43.791 --> 00:48:46.375
And it has nothing to do
with your deceased husband.

637
00:48:46.458 --> 00:48:48.333
I hate it when you read my mind.

638
00:48:48.416 --> 00:48:50.458
It comes with having a witch friend.

639
00:48:51.791 --> 00:48:52.833
"Friend."

640
00:48:52.916 --> 00:48:54.625
-Are you done?
-Yes.

641
00:48:54.708 --> 00:48:57.083
-Well. let's go for a stiff drink.
-Come on.

642
00:49:03.583 --> 00:49:04.916
Have you seen my ball?

643
00:49:08.875 --> 00:49:14.250
Like a wave. your love came into my life

644
00:49:14.333 --> 00:49:20.041
Like a wave of fire and caresses

645
00:49:20.125 --> 00:49:25.125
The white foam. the murmur of shells

646
00:49:25.208 --> 00:49:28.791
Like a wave…

647
00:49:30.375 --> 00:49:31.208
Thank you.

648
00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:34.083
You really didn't know this place?

649
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:37.791
The truth is that it's not really
my kind of place. No.

650
00:49:37.875 --> 00:49:41.708
-I don't usually go out at night.
-Sure. your daughter goes out for you.

651
00:49:41.791 --> 00:49:45.041
She should pay you a salary
for all that babysitting.

652
00:49:45.125 --> 00:49:47.958
-If you had children. you'd get it.
-I don't have any. and I get it.

653
00:49:48.041 --> 00:49:50.583
-Sure. you're a saint. not like me.
-You mean me?

654
00:49:54.583 --> 00:49:56.708
Do you feel
this is your kind of place now?

655
00:49:56.791 --> 00:50:00.083
To each their own.
You never get tired of arguing. do you?

656
00:50:00.708 --> 00:50:01.541
Cheers.

657
00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:05.041
-No. What do you want to toast to?
-To Father Pilón.

658
00:50:05.833 --> 00:50:07.416
-To Father Pilón.
-Father Pilón.

659
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.750
-Hey! No. You can't toast with water.
-You are so picky!

660
00:50:10.833 --> 00:50:13.916
My father used to say. "Don't trust
someone who only drinks water."

661
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.416
You know what? That explains a lot.

662
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:17.541
-Gimme.
-No. Paz.

663
00:50:17.625 --> 00:50:19.625
Come on. Once a year won't hurt.

664
00:50:19.708 --> 00:50:22.208
-And once a month can't hurt either.
-Fine.

665
00:50:22.291 --> 00:50:24.125
-Cheers!
-You always persuade me.

666
00:50:24.208 --> 00:50:25.833
-To Father Pilón!
-Father Pilón!

667
00:50:25.916 --> 00:50:27.166
-Sagrario?
-Yes?

668
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:30.666
Do we know each other?

669
00:50:31.416 --> 00:50:33.958
You're all here. How wonderful.

670
00:50:35.666 --> 00:50:38.458
You saved my life about 20 years ago.

671
00:50:39.083 --> 00:50:41.958
I was a stewardess. I lived in a duplex.

672
00:50:43.333 --> 00:50:44.958
-That's right!
-How wonderful!

673
00:50:45.041 --> 00:50:46.791
How amazing. He didn't want to leave.

674
00:50:46.875 --> 00:50:50.333
He wanted to disinherit his daughter.
who had sold his apartment.

675
00:50:50.416 --> 00:50:52.375
You kept laughing and said.

676
00:50:52.458 --> 00:50:54.875
"How can you disinherit her
if you're already dead?"

677
00:50:54.958 --> 00:50:58.666
And he stood there and said. "No!
I won't leave until I disinherit her."

678
00:50:59.458 --> 00:51:02.458
I don't know what you did.
but it was a miracle.

679
00:51:02.541 --> 00:51:03.916
My son lives there now.

680
00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:05.791
But he was a kid!

681
00:51:05.875 --> 00:51:08.666
He's 32 years old now
and has two children.

682
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:10.291
Holy Moses!

683
00:51:10.375 --> 00:51:11.750
I'm so glad to see you all!

684
00:51:11.833 --> 00:51:12.666
Likewise.

685
00:51:13.291 --> 00:51:14.291
Have a good time.

686
00:51:15.125 --> 00:51:16.833
-You too.
-Well. all the best.

687
00:51:17.791 --> 00:51:20.750
I saw a light of disenchantment

688
00:51:22.375 --> 00:51:26.708
I was ashamed of my star…

689
00:51:26.791 --> 00:51:31.041
Don Federico. with that gold watch chain.
that frock coat… What a man.

690
00:51:31.125 --> 00:51:34.041
We have seen all types.

691
00:51:34.125 --> 00:51:37.041
The Federico case was just before
the Vergara Palace. right?

692
00:51:37.125 --> 00:51:39.000
Yes. Your Achilles heel.

693
00:51:39.083 --> 00:51:42.833
Well. let sleeping dogs lie.
That day she almost died on the spot.

694
00:51:42.916 --> 00:51:45.458
What was his--
Sarmiento was the name of that bastard!

695
00:51:45.541 --> 00:51:47.625
He had an awful temper.
and he was a priest.

696
00:51:47.708 --> 00:51:50.291
A priest from the Inquisition.
He almost killed Gloria.

697
00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:52.458
Anyway. he left in the end.

698
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.291
Well. that's what we've been told.
But not thanks to you.

699
00:51:56.375 --> 00:51:59.083
That's enough! C'est fini.

700
00:51:59.166 --> 00:52:04.000
Hello. friends. Today I got divorced.
so I'm going to dedicate this song to you.

701
00:52:05.666 --> 00:52:07.000
I fail one case…

702
00:52:10.208 --> 00:52:11.041
One?

703
00:52:13.125 --> 00:52:14.791
You haven't contacted my husband.

704
00:52:14.875 --> 00:52:17.541
No. Please. I beg you. not today.

705
00:52:18.291 --> 00:52:19.458
I'm very tired.

706
00:52:19.541 --> 00:52:23.166
-You couldn't. or you didn't want to?
-How can you be so unfair to me?

707
00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:25.250
We've been trying for years.

708
00:52:25.333 --> 00:52:30.458
You even took me to the car
where you "met" for the first time.

709
00:52:30.541 --> 00:52:34.208
It's true. But I know why
you don't want to contact him.

710
00:52:34.291 --> 00:52:36.666
-Are you a psychic?
-What did I say when I joined?

711
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:40.541
That my sole purpose
was to find my husband. Carlos.

712
00:52:40.625 --> 00:52:45.625
So. you really think I didn't contact him
so you wouldn't leave the group?

713
00:52:45.708 --> 00:52:49.916
Who got Jiménez del Oso to talk about us?
Who got our cases published in the press?

714
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.041
You're right.

715
00:52:52.125 --> 00:52:54.833
You're the only one
who makes a profit from what we do.

716
00:52:54.916 --> 00:52:57.541
This group wouldn't still exist
if it weren't for me.

717
00:52:57.625 --> 00:52:59.333
-And me!
-It's like I don't exist.

718
00:52:59.416 --> 00:53:02.166
No. you film very well.
You do it phenomenally.

719
00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:06.208
But a paranormal team without a medium
is like hunting without a shotgun.

720
00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:08.166
I work my butt off here every day.

721
00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:10.458
You're only interested in the dead!

722
00:53:10.541 --> 00:53:14.291
You're only interested in the living
so you can prescribe tranquilizers! Right?

723
00:53:14.375 --> 00:53:17.416
Pea. pea. peacock
Pea. pea. peacock…

724
00:53:18.083 --> 00:53:20.791
Ask her. She's leaving us.
She's going to be a pharmacist.

725
00:53:23.458 --> 00:53:26.875
-Did you go through my documents?
-For now. I'm not a mind reader.

726
00:53:26.958 --> 00:53:28.125
Ask her.

727
00:53:30.708 --> 00:53:33.541
Don't you know… what they say?

728
00:53:33.625 --> 00:53:37.166
That whatever you don't do before 50.
you never do?

729
00:53:38.041 --> 00:53:39.750
Well. I have already turned 50.

730
00:53:39.833 --> 00:53:40.791
A few years ago.

731
00:53:41.541 --> 00:53:43.750
Very well. leave us. Whenever you want.

732
00:53:45.458 --> 00:53:48.958
Hey. Gloria. Finish your drink.
We have to know what's going on there.

733
00:53:49.041 --> 00:53:51.583
Thanks. Sagrario.
but I don't need your permission.

734
00:53:51.666 --> 00:53:53.791
Be careful not to end up
like Father Pilón.

735
00:53:56.333 --> 00:53:59.125
Please… Let me through!

736
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.916
-Well…
-She left without paying.

737
00:54:03.416 --> 00:54:05.000
Fantastic. fantastic. fantastic

738
00:54:19.041 --> 00:54:21.833
It's crazy! It's really coming down.

739
00:54:21.916 --> 00:54:23.833
When it rains. it pours.

740
00:54:29.625 --> 00:54:30.541
Oh shit.

741
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:35.916
You get it. Paz. I'll be right back.

742
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:36.833
Okay.

743
00:54:46.833 --> 00:54:47.666
The key.

744
00:54:54.166 --> 00:54:55.291
What's going on?

745
00:54:56.541 --> 00:54:57.666
Goodness me!

746
00:55:07.708 --> 00:55:08.708
I'm coming!

747
00:55:11.458 --> 00:55:12.500
Coming.

748
00:55:15.333 --> 00:55:17.541
Hello. good evening. Sorry it's late.

749
00:55:18.875 --> 00:55:21.250
-Oh my.
-We'll clean it up later. don't worry.

750
00:55:21.333 --> 00:55:24.333
-You need to clean up what's in there.
-We're working on it.

751
00:55:24.416 --> 00:55:27.375
What You Need is Love is just finishing.

752
00:55:27.458 --> 00:55:28.916
Can I speak to your daughter?

753
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.750
-No.
-This is hers. right?

754
00:55:30.833 --> 00:55:33.750
-Yes. Please leave my child alone.
-Yes. but--

755
00:55:34.875 --> 00:55:36.000
It's about the case.

756
00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:38.250
We need statements.

757
00:55:39.125 --> 00:55:40.750
-Statements for TV?
-For TV.

758
00:55:40.833 --> 00:55:43.125
I'll talk to her first.
and we'll film it later.

759
00:55:43.208 --> 00:55:46.291
-Come in. I'll lend you a towel.
-Really? Thank you.

760
00:55:46.375 --> 00:55:47.375
Come on in.

761
00:55:47.458 --> 00:55:49.250
-We'll film later. okay?
-Sure.

762
00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:05.125
Oh. my husband. poor thing.

763
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.791
He looked exactly like Bertín Osborne.

764
00:56:08.333 --> 00:56:12.791
Well. she's in her room over there.
She's probably reading. She loves it.

765
00:56:12.875 --> 00:56:15.875
Well. Superpop magazine.
She loves to see photos of celebrities.

766
00:56:15.958 --> 00:56:17.500
She doesn't pay me any attention.

767
00:56:17.583 --> 00:56:18.416
This…

768
00:56:19.541 --> 00:56:21.541
The show's starting. May I?

769
00:56:22.583 --> 00:56:26.041
Susanita. stay with this lady.
She's going to talk to you for a while.

770
00:56:27.583 --> 00:56:30.250
Hello. Isn't it cold? It's really raining.

771
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:48.666
You're Susanita. right?

772
00:56:53.125 --> 00:56:55.375
That's a cool magazine you're reading.

773
00:57:00.666 --> 00:57:02.916
You have a lot of dolls.
Which is your favorite?

774
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.916
Guitarist Barbie and Lola.

775
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.166
Is that Lola?

776
00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:09.416
She's very pretty.

777
00:57:11.166 --> 00:57:12.000
Is this one yours?

778
00:57:44.083 --> 00:57:46.041
Do you know who did this to your doll?

779
00:57:51.166 --> 00:57:52.416
You like TV.

780
00:57:53.416 --> 00:57:56.041
Well. you know what? I can get you on TV.

781
00:57:56.125 --> 00:57:59.500
But first. you have to help me.
You have to tell me who did this.

782
00:58:02.708 --> 00:58:05.250
Are you afraid? If it was you. it's okay.

783
00:58:05.333 --> 00:58:06.875
No. it wasn't me.

784
00:58:07.458 --> 00:58:08.708
Then who did it?

785
00:58:09.458 --> 00:58:12.125
-I have a boyfriend. He's very handsome.
-Really?

786
00:58:12.833 --> 00:58:13.916
What's his name?

787
00:58:18.208 --> 00:58:21.958
He always says hello. smiles.
and stops to talk to me.

788
00:58:22.041 --> 00:58:23.416
Did he do this to the doll?

789
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.125
Is he here now?

790
00:58:34.375 --> 00:58:36.833
I see him when he's on his way home.

791
00:58:47.083 --> 00:58:49.000
ALCAÑIZ THEATER

792
00:58:56.208 --> 00:58:59.083
-Do you ever talk to him?
-He loves me. He's very handsome.

793
00:58:59.166 --> 00:59:02.416
Yes. he is very handsome.
You're very lucky.

794
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.291
Yes. very. He helps me when they hurt me.

795
00:59:06.875 --> 00:59:09.541
-Does Quimi hurt you?
-No. he's my boyfriend.

796
00:59:10.208 --> 00:59:11.708
And who hurts you. honey?

797
00:59:28.375 --> 00:59:31.375
Honey. you can trust me.
Tell me who's hurting you.

798
00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:39.083
My glasses.

799
00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:55.083
I love your pajamas.
You have to lend me them one day.

800
00:59:58.541 --> 00:59:59.375
Does that hurt?

801
01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:06.416
Does it hurt here?

802
01:00:08.583 --> 01:00:09.541
May I see?

803
01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:21.166
Do you have them anywhere else. honey?

804
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:32.375
Who did this to you. honey?

805
01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:48.000
Not the girl!

806
01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:54.500
Do you like the rain?

807
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.875
Do you want to go out?

808
01:00:56.958 --> 01:01:00.458
But we can't tell anyone.
It's a secret. Only you and I know.

809
01:01:13.666 --> 01:01:14.541
Come on.

810
01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:15.791
Quietly.

811
01:01:25.083 --> 01:01:27.041
There we go. Give me your hand.

812
01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:39.500
Stay very quiet.

813
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.666
No! What are you doing?
Where are you going. Susanita?

814
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:44.208
I want my doll.

815
01:01:48.708 --> 01:01:51.708
Listen to me. honey.
We have to get out of here.

816
01:01:55.958 --> 01:01:56.791
Come here.

817
01:01:59.125 --> 01:02:00.125
Coming!

818
01:02:04.416 --> 01:02:05.500
I'm coming!

819
01:02:13.458 --> 01:02:15.333
-Who is it?
-Hello. is Sagrario here?

820
01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:17.916
-Who?
-My coworker.

821
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.125
-She was with me.
-No. there's no one here.

822
01:02:20.208 --> 01:02:22.250
She told me she was coming to see you.

823
01:02:22.333 --> 01:02:23.291
She didn't come.

824
01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:24.916
-How strange. It's…
-Yes.

825
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.583
It's just that it's all flooded in there.
and I need a mop to clean it up.

826
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:31.916
Until the firefighters come.

827
01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:38.041
Now keep quiet.

828
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:45.125
I'll get it right back to you.

829
01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:46.541
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

830
01:03:09.291 --> 01:03:10.250
Thank you very much.

831
01:03:14.083 --> 01:03:16.125
May I have a glass of water?

832
01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:23.750
Go. run.

833
01:03:25.416 --> 01:03:27.166
It's raining cats and dogs. right?

834
01:03:29.583 --> 01:03:32.625
But the reservoirs will be glad
because water is life.

835
01:03:42.083 --> 01:03:44.500
Could I borrow a towel to dry off a bit?

836
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:51.625
Well…

837
01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:56.500
I've never been able
to make a good Spanish omelet.

838
01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:57.583
How do you make it?

839
01:03:57.666 --> 01:03:58.708
I'm leaving. Mom.

840
01:03:59.291 --> 01:04:02.166
…who add onion. others don't…

841
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:03.875
How do you do it?

842
01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:05.625
Do you add onion?

843
01:04:05.708 --> 01:04:07.083
Bye. Mom!

844
01:04:28.625 --> 01:04:29.750
Susanita. get out!

845
01:05:32.708 --> 01:05:34.208
Paz. wake up!

846
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.083
Think of your daughter.

847
01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:54.708
Easy now.

848
01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:59.291
I really can't leave you two alone.

849
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.208
…as soon as I saw the letter.
I said. "This is the man of my life."

850
01:06:24.583 --> 01:06:25.708
Goodbye. Susanita.

851
01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:32.375
Don't worry. The girl will spend
the night in a shelter.

852
01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:33.583
What about the mother?

853
01:06:34.125 --> 01:06:38.458
The mother is coming with us
to the station. Let's see what she says.

854
01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:41.208
-Although she is totally disoriented.
-Thank you.

855
01:06:49.958 --> 01:06:51.083
How are you. Paz?

856
01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:52.708
Fine. I'm fine.

857
01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.750
Thank you so much. Thank you too.

858
01:06:55.833 --> 01:06:56.666
Come on.

859
01:06:58.458 --> 01:06:59.291
Let's go.

860
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:02.583
Let's go.

861
01:07:07.666 --> 01:07:08.500
Are you okay?

862
01:07:27.958 --> 01:07:31.500
Come on. let's go.
I feel like I've been run over by a truck.

863
01:07:31.583 --> 01:07:33.250
You took a good beating.

864
01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:36.708
Well. no one likes a coward.

865
01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:41.291
I hope you listen to me next time.
I told you there was nothing here.

866
01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:42.791
What about Quimi?

867
01:07:43.791 --> 01:07:45.666
He's a character in her favorite series.

868
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:50.708
and apparently. the lead actor is
doing a play at the theater over there.

869
01:07:50.791 --> 01:07:52.916
She sees him pass her window every night.

870
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.333
That poor girl's suffering
was the key to everything in the end.

871
01:07:57.416 --> 01:07:59.291
-Are you okay to drive. Paz?
-Yes.

872
01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:03.041
The urge I have to see my granddaughters
will take away the pain.

873
01:08:04.958 --> 01:08:06.958
You're such a masochist. for God's sake.

874
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:11.375
Okay. you phenomenons. let's go.

875
01:08:17.416 --> 01:08:18.250
What?

876
01:08:20.041 --> 01:08:22.166
I've never been so happy to see you.

877
01:08:24.083 --> 01:08:26.291
It's the second time
I saved your life today.

878
01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:31.458
Thanks.

879
01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:33.458
Don't get used to it.

880
01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:41.333
I don't want to be annoying.

881
01:08:41.416 --> 01:08:43.833
but I don't think the song is
a coincidence.

882
01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:47.375
It was the music
from a car commercial. Sagrario.

883
01:08:47.458 --> 01:08:49.083
Merde. The ball.

884
01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:50.833
-Oh no!
-You are kidding. right?

885
01:08:51.666 --> 01:08:52.666
Give me the keys.

886
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.125
There isn't a single muscle
in my body that doesn't hurt.

887
01:09:07.208 --> 01:09:10.416
-Not one piece of cartilage.
-I can't wait to get home.

888
01:09:11.083 --> 01:09:14.250
-A Valium and straight to bed.
-I've never taken any of that stuff.

889
01:09:14.333 --> 01:09:16.916
You don't need it.
You're the most stable of us three.

890
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.500
-And the most boring.
-No.

891
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.708
A conventional life
doesn't seem like a bad plan to me.

892
01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:24.291
I don't know what to tell you.

893
01:09:24.375 --> 01:09:26.625
Do you have a cigarette? I'm out.

894
01:09:26.708 --> 01:09:28.416
Let's see if there's any here.

895
01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.750
-No. empty.
-Oh. it's cold.

896
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:34.208
Let's see if Gloria has any.

897
01:09:34.291 --> 01:09:35.666
I'll check my pockets.

898
01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:36.875
Let's check her purse.

899
01:09:41.041 --> 01:09:42.166
I don't believe it!

900
01:09:52.333 --> 01:09:53.166
Let's go.

901
01:09:53.666 --> 01:09:55.666
Wait! The power is out.

902
01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:21.250
Look.

903
01:10:28.041 --> 01:10:29.458
I sprained my ankle here.

904
01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:33.875
It's here.

905
01:10:35.958 --> 01:10:37.541
-What?
-Look.

906
01:10:51.666 --> 01:10:54.666
Gloria. this isn't funny at all!
Where are you?

907
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.083
Stop hiding. woman! Please.

908
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:08.916
There!

909
01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:15.125
Come here. Paz! Look. help me.

910
01:11:15.208 --> 01:11:17.375
Let's move the cabinet. Come on.

911
01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:19.666
Okay. come here.

912
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:21.208
-Okay.
-On three. okay?

913
01:11:21.291 --> 01:11:24.291
-Okay.
-One. two. three.

914
01:11:29.125 --> 01:11:32.791
-This is impossible! It weighs a ton.
-It's not moved an inch.

915
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:37.416
-My varicose veins are going to burst.
-No! We can do it.

916
01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.166
-Right?
-We can.

917
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:43.291
-We can. You'll see how we can.
-We can. Let's go.

918
01:11:45.041 --> 01:11:46.625
-Okay. again.
-Come on.

919
01:11:46.708 --> 01:11:48.875
-On three. Come on. Paz.
-Come on.

920
01:11:48.958 --> 01:11:52.166
Be strong. Come on.
Breathe. One. two. and three.

921
01:11:57.916 --> 01:11:59.291
-Okay.
-What is this?

922
01:11:59.375 --> 01:12:00.291
The flashlight.

923
01:12:06.166 --> 01:12:07.208
That's disgusting!

924
01:12:12.125 --> 01:12:13.875
It smells like rotten meat.

925
01:12:13.958 --> 01:12:18.416
Sagrario. we are too old for this.

926
01:12:19.708 --> 01:12:20.541
Okay.

927
01:12:23.291 --> 01:12:24.541
Let's go. Be careful.

928
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:28.833
Gloria's jacket!

929
01:12:28.916 --> 01:12:31.541
Gloria! Are you there?

930
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:36.583
Come on.

931
01:12:37.708 --> 01:12:38.583
Are you sure?

932
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.708
She saved my life twice.

933
01:12:41.333 --> 01:12:43.958
Yeah. but I don't owe her anything.

934
01:13:00.791 --> 01:13:01.916
What is this place?

935
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.833
Be careful.

936
01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:17.125
Gloria. what are you doing?

937
01:13:54.083 --> 01:13:55.125
What's this?

938
01:13:57.083 --> 01:14:00.333
Toys for your grandchildren.

939
01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:03.750
Don't you dare mention my grandchildren!

940
01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:07.375
What do you want?

941
01:14:09.458 --> 01:14:12.833
Why did you take the mother away?

942
01:14:13.708 --> 01:14:17.916
I enjoyed playing
with her simpleton of a daughter

943
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.458
and with her shouting and din.

944
01:14:23.541 --> 01:14:24.875
What do you need?

945
01:14:27.208 --> 01:14:29.416
Three witches. and here they are.

946
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.750
I can help you.

947
01:14:31.958 --> 01:14:33.666
I just need you to release my friend.

948
01:14:34.291 --> 01:14:35.750
Am I your friend?

949
01:14:35.833 --> 01:14:37.000
Of course you are. silly.

950
01:14:41.166 --> 01:14:44.375
Gloria. I know you can hear me.
You have to get out of there.

951
01:14:44.458 --> 01:14:46.083
-Please!
-You don't have much time.

952
01:14:46.166 --> 01:14:50.250
I have all the time in the world.

953
01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:12.375
What's that?

954
01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:16.666
Harlots who sold their souls to the Devil.

955
01:15:17.916 --> 01:15:21.000
They called themselves witches.

956
01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:24.166
and they were nothing more
than scoundrels.

957
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:27.916
When they passed through my hands…

958
01:15:37.291 --> 01:15:39.583
their screams deafened

959
01:15:39.666 --> 01:15:44.458
the creaking of their breaking bones.

960
01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:47.125
-We have to wake her up. Sagrario.
-It's very dangerous.

961
01:15:47.208 --> 01:15:48.583
We can't wait any longer!

962
01:15:49.625 --> 01:15:51.833
Okay. You take one side.
I'll take the other.

963
01:15:57.958 --> 01:16:00.875
I only need three.

964
01:16:03.291 --> 01:16:05.541
I have awaited you for an age.

965
01:16:06.208 --> 01:16:08.000
But fear not.

966
01:16:08.708 --> 01:16:11.958
You shall have a fair trial.

967
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:20.625
One stab is enough to verify that

968
01:16:20.708 --> 01:16:22.458
since she doesn't bleed.

969
01:16:23.833 --> 01:16:26.958
there is no trace of humanity left
in her body.

970
01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:31.875
You shouldn't have left me alone!

971
01:16:31.958 --> 01:16:34.250
-It's Father Pilón!
-No!

972
01:16:34.333 --> 01:16:37.583
-It's him. Let go. Paz. Help us. Father.
-No. Sagrario. It's not him.

973
01:16:37.666 --> 01:16:40.750
-Look at me. You have to help us.
-Listen to me. It's not him.

974
01:16:41.916 --> 01:16:43.083
But that's a good idea.

975
01:16:44.958 --> 01:16:48.000
Gloria. listen to me.
You have to find Father Pilón.

976
01:16:48.083 --> 01:16:50.541
You have to find him! He'll help you!

977
01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:52.708
Look for him!

978
01:16:57.458 --> 01:16:58.458
Hold on. Gloria.

979
01:17:04.958 --> 01:17:07.166
I am not…

980
01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:10.125
strong enough. Father.

981
01:17:11.416 --> 01:17:12.333
Give me your hand.

982
01:17:13.666 --> 01:17:14.500
Come with me.

983
01:17:31.666 --> 01:17:32.666
This is…

984
01:17:33.333 --> 01:17:34.875
The Vergara Palace.

985
01:17:34.958 --> 01:17:38.125
Is Sarmiento the one in that antique shop?

986
01:17:38.208 --> 01:17:39.666
He used me to find you.

987
01:17:40.416 --> 01:17:41.666
I am sorry.

988
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:43.458
Gloria. you have to face him.

989
01:17:43.541 --> 01:17:44.541
I can't.

990
01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:50.875
I can't. He's much stronger than me.

991
01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:53.458
-Of course you can.
-You have a gift.

992
01:17:53.541 --> 01:17:56.375
I don't want to do this anymore. Father.

993
01:17:56.458 --> 01:17:59.541
You have a gift
and much more power than you can imagine.

994
01:17:59.625 --> 01:18:02.291
He's like you. You can enter into him.

995
01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.458
He's like you.

996
01:18:05.916 --> 01:18:06.750
I know.

997
01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:10.083
I know.

998
01:18:11.166 --> 01:18:13.416
I can't. I don't want to. Father.

999
01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:14.583
I don't want to!

1000
01:18:15.375 --> 01:18:17.750
It is the same process but in reverse.

1001
01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:19.875
What will happen to you?

1002
01:18:22.458 --> 01:18:23.625
Bring him to me.

1003
01:18:29.041 --> 01:18:33.375
-Gloria. I know you can hear me. focus!
-You have to get out. Do you hear me?

1004
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:38.250
Sweetheart. Gloria is not your friend.

1005
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:43.125
No. She has always known where to find me.

1006
01:18:45.333 --> 01:18:50.625
He can help us be together forever.

1007
01:18:55.458 --> 01:18:57.916
-Can you do that?
-I can do anything!

1008
01:19:04.791 --> 01:19:06.541
Sagrario. he's tricking you.

1009
01:19:06.625 --> 01:19:07.666
Shut up.

1010
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:09.500
Fleur de lis. we're together at last.

1011
01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:11.500
-It's him. My love.
-No.

1012
01:19:12.458 --> 01:19:14.250
I've missed your voice. my love.

1013
01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:16.666
Didn't you have a code?
Ask him for the code.

1014
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:18.458
I've never stopped looking for you.

1015
01:19:18.541 --> 01:19:21.416
The code!
Say the code. you fucking bastard!

1016
01:19:22.541 --> 01:19:23.500
Naples.

1017
01:19:24.125 --> 01:19:25.125
Tolstoy.

1018
01:19:25.958 --> 01:19:27.208
Seventeen.

1019
01:19:28.416 --> 01:19:29.375
White.

1020
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.041
Mikima.

1021
01:19:31.875 --> 01:19:33.083
Nineteen.

1022
01:19:33.166 --> 01:19:35.708
No. I don't think it's him.
It can't be him.

1023
01:19:35.791 --> 01:19:37.500
Sagrario. it can't be him.

1024
01:20:09.625 --> 01:20:11.875
I can't lose him now. Don't you get it?

1025
01:20:11.958 --> 01:20:13.666
-Sagrario!
-Let me go!

1026
01:20:14.541 --> 01:20:16.625
-Let me go!
-Sagrario!

1027
01:20:18.333 --> 01:20:20.166
Gloria. wake up!

1028
01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:27.750
Wake up. Gloria!

1029
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:32.666
There's little time. He mustn't beat you.

1030
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:34.500
I am very tired.

1031
01:20:34.583 --> 01:20:36.750
You'll have to carry on without me.

1032
01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:39.500
-Father. I won't let you go.
-My work is done.

1033
01:20:39.583 --> 01:20:42.958
-Now it's your turn. Trust in yourself!
-Gloria!

1034
01:20:43.041 --> 01:20:45.125
Gloria! I'm here. Gloria.

1035
01:20:45.625 --> 01:20:47.625
You can't abandon me. Carlos. No!

1036
01:20:48.333 --> 01:20:50.625
No! Carlos! For God's sake. don't go!

1037
01:20:50.708 --> 01:20:53.000
Please don't leave me alone. Carlos!

1038
01:20:57.208 --> 01:20:58.708
Get away!

1039
01:21:04.041 --> 01:21:05.750
Stay with me!

1040
01:21:08.208 --> 01:21:09.458
Sagrario. I'm sorry.

1041
01:21:09.958 --> 01:21:11.791
I'm sorry. Sagrario?

1042
01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.000
Wake up. Gloria!

1043
01:21:22.083 --> 01:21:23.250
Gloria. wake up!

1044
01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:25.375
Wake up!

1045
01:21:26.458 --> 01:21:27.625
Wake up!

1046
01:21:31.916 --> 01:21:32.875
I am ready.

1047
01:21:32.958 --> 01:21:35.166
No. Father! No. please!

1048
01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:37.500
No one can escape their destiny.
including you.

1049
01:21:37.583 --> 01:21:40.375
I'm afraid. Father. I can't.

1050
01:21:40.458 --> 01:21:41.708
You have to do it!

1051
01:21:41.791 --> 01:21:44.750
For you. for them.
for the people who need you.

1052
01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:47.583
Bring him to me now!

1053
01:22:36.416 --> 01:22:38.125
Gloria! Wake up.

1054
01:23:02.125 --> 01:23:03.375
Breathe. It's okay.

1055
01:23:34.083 --> 01:23:34.916
Shit!

1056
01:23:39.875 --> 01:23:41.375
Gloria. breathe.

1057
01:23:42.708 --> 01:23:43.541
I'm okay.

1058
01:23:44.166 --> 01:23:46.375
-You're okay?
-What happened to her?

1059
01:23:46.458 --> 01:23:47.791
Come on. Get up there.

1060
01:23:50.208 --> 01:23:52.250
But we need something durable.

1061
01:23:53.625 --> 01:23:54.791
Something durable.

1062
01:24:18.916 --> 01:24:20.875
Come on. Let's get her out of here.

1063
01:24:26.125 --> 01:24:26.958
Come on.

1064
01:24:27.458 --> 01:24:29.416
-Do you have her. Paz?
-Let's go.

1065
01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:32.500
One. two. three!

1066
01:24:37.833 --> 01:24:39.208
Come on!

1067
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Sagrario!

1068
01:24:51.958 --> 01:24:53.083
Is she breathing?

1069
01:24:53.166 --> 01:24:54.875
Yes.

1070
01:24:56.083 --> 01:24:57.416
Come up here.

1071
01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.500
Keep her out.

1072
01:25:00.791 --> 01:25:02.041
Come on.

1073
01:25:05.083 --> 01:25:06.791
-There.
-Come on. Gloria.

1074
01:25:06.875 --> 01:25:09.541
-Come on.
-Come on. Another one.

1075
01:25:10.833 --> 01:25:11.666
Good.

1076
01:25:13.416 --> 01:25:15.083
Yes! There she is.

1077
01:25:17.458 --> 01:25:19.291
Come on. That's it.

1078
01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:48.208
Come on.

1079
01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:50.791
-Breathe.
-Do you have…

1080
01:25:51.916 --> 01:25:53.958
-There. Come on.
-Careful.

1081
01:25:55.166 --> 01:25:56.000
What?

1082
01:25:56.791 --> 01:25:58.291
Do you have a cigarette?

1083
01:26:02.208 --> 01:26:05.125
Go to sleep. child
Go to sleep now

1084
01:26:05.625 --> 01:26:09.000
Grammy will take care of you

1085
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.791
Right. off to bed.

1086
01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:13.583
I'm having a hot chocolate
with my friends.

1087
01:26:13.666 --> 01:26:15.208
Come on. Go to bed. honey.

1088
01:26:15.833 --> 01:26:16.875
Bye. sweetie.

1089
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:21.708
Why did your daughter
call you at this hour?

1090
01:26:22.208 --> 01:26:23.166
And on my phone?

1091
01:26:23.833 --> 01:26:28.166
Well. the little one woke up
and asked for me. She's so sweet.

1092
01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.916
You put up with so much.

1093
01:26:50.083 --> 01:26:52.041
You scared me to death. for God's sake!

1094
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.125
Are you okay?

1095
01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:00.250
Yes.

1096
01:27:02.375 --> 01:27:03.958
-I've come from--
-Father Pilón.

1097
01:27:15.458 --> 01:27:16.708
He said goodbye. Paz.

1098
01:27:19.416 --> 01:27:20.583
Did you know about it?

1099
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:24.666
What happened here?

1100
01:27:32.875 --> 01:27:34.500
We'll tell you over a whiskey.

1101
01:27:36.833 --> 01:27:40.708
Here it explains the story of the priest
who lived in the rectory that burned down.

1102
01:27:43.166 --> 01:27:44.000
Yes.

1103
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:46.291
I'll have a strong one.

1104
01:27:47.166 --> 01:27:52.041
Before he was transferred here.
he lived in the Vergara Palace.

1105
01:27:53.583 --> 01:27:57.791
He was relegated to a small parish
and banned from continuing the witch hunt.

1106
01:27:57.875 --> 01:28:00.250
but he continued to judge women

1107
01:28:00.333 --> 01:28:03.875
because he was obsessed
with surpassing Pierre de Lancre.

1108
01:28:04.375 --> 01:28:06.791
who had killed 81 women.

1109
01:28:07.291 --> 01:28:09.750
Being beaten by a frog
must have bothered him.

1110
01:28:09.833 --> 01:28:13.125
There was a fire
in one of his clandestine trials.

1111
01:28:13.625 --> 01:28:14.791
and he burned to death.

1112
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:19.583
He was three witches short
of surpassing De Lancre.

1113
01:28:20.291 --> 01:28:21.666
"I only need three."

1114
01:28:22.708 --> 01:28:25.291
One. two. and three.

1115
01:28:25.375 --> 01:28:26.708
You're goddamn brilliant.

1116
01:28:27.708 --> 01:28:29.875
-I've never heard you swear before.
-Me neither.

1117
01:28:29.958 --> 01:28:31.375
The occasion demands it.

1118
01:28:31.458 --> 01:28:33.375
-Let's toast.
-Did you like it?

1119
01:28:33.458 --> 01:28:35.041
-Yes. damn it!
-Damn it!

1120
01:28:35.125 --> 01:28:37.333
-You're goddamn brilliant!
-Shut up.

1121
01:28:38.291 --> 01:28:40.916
-Thank you. Jesús. my dear.
-Well. to Father Pilón.

1122
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.666
-To Father Pilón.
-Father Pilón.

1123
01:28:49.333 --> 01:28:52.916
Well. now that Father Pilón is gone.
the group--

1124
01:28:55.375 --> 01:28:57.000
Can you see me in a white coat?

1125
01:28:57.083 --> 01:28:59.875
You out there
while I'm working nights. No way.

1126
01:29:01.166 --> 01:29:03.666
Hey. Jesús.
did you do something to your hair?

1127
01:29:04.666 --> 01:29:06.333
-No.
-Well. it suits you better.

1128
01:29:07.958 --> 01:29:09.916
-Thanks.
-Right? He looks handsome.

1129
01:29:11.291 --> 01:29:13.416
Yes.

1130
01:29:14.833 --> 01:29:16.791
I have to go. I have a lot…

1131
01:29:16.875 --> 01:29:17.916
Watch out!

1132
01:29:21.375 --> 01:29:22.666
Father Pilón's penalty.
