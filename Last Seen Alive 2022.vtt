and get some gas.

51
00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:58.576

Look. I-- I need this break.
I need to clear my mind.

65
00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:49.022
I need to gain
a better perspective.

66

00:13:32.514 --> 00:13:35.086
Yeah. she's 5'9".
she's uh. dark hair.

178
00:13:35.121 --> 00:13:36.318
and she's wearin'
a pair of blue jeans.

179
00:13:36.353 --> 00:13:38.221
and a-- and a white T-shirt.

180
00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:39.992
<i>-Short sleeves.</i>
-Okay.

181
00:13:40.027 --> 00:13:41.653
-Is she from the area?
-No.

182
00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:43.358
Well. originally.
she's from this area.

183
00:13:43.393 --> 00:13:44.491
Yeah. I mean her parents

184
00:13:44.526 --> 00:13:45.965
just live along the road
in Emerson.

185
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.429
Well.
maybe she ran into a friend.

186
00:13:48.464 --> 00:13:52.004
Do you think your wife
would just run off with a friend

187
00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:54.039
when I'm putting gas
in the car?

188
00:13:54.074 --> 00:13:55.106
<i>Uh. uh. all right. all right.</i>

189
00:13:55.141 --> 00:13:56.668
<i>Listen. Mr. Spann. just relax.</i>

190
00:13:56.703 --> 00:13:58.175
<i>I'll dispatch someone</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

191
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.507
What-- what--
what is soon as possible?

192
00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:02.608
<i>Well. listen. I don't have</i>
<i>anyone available just now.</i>

193
00:14:02.643 --> 00:14:03.576
<i>-I'll call you back.</i>
-All right. well. l-- listen.

194
00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:05.248
we're in a bit
of an emergency here. okay?

195
00:14:05.283 --> 00:14:06.513
There's truck drivers
everywhere.

196
00:14:06.548 --> 00:14:08.251
Well.
I mean time is of the essence.

197
00:14:08.286 --> 00:14:09.318
She could be anywhere.

198
00:14:09.353 --> 00:14:10.990
<i>She could be in danger.</i>

199
00:14:11.025 --> 00:14:12.552
I understand
you're stressed out.

200
00:14:12.587 --> 00:14:14.928
I'll send someone
as soon as possible. okay?

201
00:14:14.963 --> 00:14:16.226
Okay. okay. okay.

202
00:14:16.261 --> 00:14:17.359
<i>I'll come myself if I have to.</i>

203
00:14:17.394 --> 00:14:19.064
Okay. Okay. thank you.

204
00:14:19.099 --> 00:14:20.626
Just be as quick as you can.
okay?

205
00:14:20.661 --> 00:14:22.463
<i>Stay by your phone.</i>
<i>keep your phone on.</i>

206
00:14:22.498 --> 00:14:23.629
<i>and stay put.</i>

207
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:58.202
Oh. shit.

208
00:15:14.686 --> 00:15:17.056
<i>We're not in.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

209
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:20.521
Hey. Barry. Anna. it's Will.

210
00:15:20.556 --> 00:15:22.259
Can you guys call me back?
I'm lookin' for Lisa.

211
00:15:22.294 --> 00:15:23.260
Thank you. bye.

212
00:15:24.593 --> 00:15:25.757
Fuck.

213
00:15:50.619 --> 00:15:51.285
Lisa?

214
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.158
I think that's them. sweetie.

215
00:15:54.689 --> 00:15:55.787
-- Lisa.
-- You got it?

216
00:15:55.822 --> 00:15:56.287
Hi. Will.

217
00:15:56.323 --> 00:15:58.064
-- Hi.
-Oh.

218
00:15:58.099 --> 00:15:59.758
-- Hey. how are you?
-Hey. I'm good. Where's Lisa?

219
00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.694
Uh. I-- I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

220
00:16:01.729 --> 00:16:03.465
Is she here?

221
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.039
No. she's not-- she's with you.

222
00:16:06.074 --> 00:16:08.107
No. she was with me.

223
00:16:08.142 --> 00:16:09.801
-Lisa!
-- Hello.

224
00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:12.243
-- Well. she's not here.
-- Okay. okay.

225
00:16:12.278 --> 00:16:14.608
-- Barry!
-Yes. sweetie.

226
00:16:14.643 --> 00:16:15.309
Hi.

227
00:16:15.344 --> 00:16:17.677
-Hey. Barry!
-Will's here.

228
00:16:17.712 --> 00:16:19.646
- Um. I-- I. uh--
-- What's the matter?

229
00:16:19.681 --> 00:16:20.779
I don't know. Something's wrong.

230
00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:22.220
What?

231
00:16:22.255 --> 00:16:23.353
You guys didn't hear from her?
She didn't call?

232
00:16:23.388 --> 00:16:24.651
-No. she's-- is it--
-What? No.

233
00:16:24.686 --> 00:16:26.257
I-- I-- I thought
maybe she came here.

234
00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:27.058
Uh. no. wait a second.

235
00:16:27.093 --> 00:16:28.490
No. uh-- uh.
weren't you supposed

236
00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:31.097
-to drop her off here?
-Yeah.

237
00:16:31.132 --> 00:16:34.331
Uh. one minute she was here.
the next minute she was gone.

238
00:16:34.366 --> 00:16:36.069
Uh. what uh.
what do you mean by that?

239
00:16:37.732 --> 00:16:39.303
What do you mean she's gone?

240
00:16:39.338 --> 00:16:42.141
We stopped to get gas.

241
00:16:42.176 --> 00:16:45.342
and she went into the market.
and...

242
00:16:45.377 --> 00:16:48.081
-- Right.
-She didn't come back out.

243
00:16:48.116 --> 00:16:48.915
I don't--

244
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.314
She's still
in the gas station then.

245
00:16:50.349 --> 00:16:52.250
No. she's not still
in the gas station.

246
00:16:52.285 --> 00:16:53.251
-- I--
-Is she in the--

247
00:16:53.286 --> 00:16:54.252
In the bathroom? Did you check--

248
00:16:54.287 --> 00:16:55.649
I've looked in the restrooms.
I've looked--

249
00:16:55.684 --> 00:16:57.189
Yes. I checked the whole damn
gas station.

250
00:16:57.224 --> 00:16:58.421
Okay. which ga--
which gas station

251
00:16:58.456 --> 00:16:59.554
were you're at?
Let's start there.

252
00:16:59.589 --> 00:17:02.260
The Veldro on uh. you know. 64.

253
00:17:02.295 --> 00:17:04.526
Okay. that's about five miles
from here.

254
00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:06.693
so she wouldn't walk from there.

255
00:17:06.728 --> 00:17:09.168
So. I have to ask you this.
Will.

256
00:17:09.203 --> 00:17:11.632
uh. did you have a fight?

257
00:17:11.667 --> 00:17:14.107
Is that what this is?
You had a fight and--

258
00:17:14.142 --> 00:17:16.538
No. Barry.
we didn't have a fight.

259
00:17:16.573 --> 00:17:18.705
We're going through some stuff
as-- as you know.

260
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.245
but we did not have a fight.

261
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.609
And I can't explain--
okay. listen.

262
00:17:21.644 --> 00:17:24.117
did she have anybody else know
she was comin'?

263
00:17:24.152 --> 00:17:25.877
Any friends or anything
or anybody that--

264
00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:26.778
Just friends.

265
00:17:26.813 --> 00:17:28.814
But did you speak
to any of her friends?

266
00:17:28.849 --> 00:17:30.585
No. wait a second.
Wait. wait. wait!

267
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.817
Now uh. listen.
what are you saying?

268
00:17:31.852 --> 00:17:33.819
That it's because of us?
Is that it?

269
00:17:33.854 --> 00:17:35.491
-I'm not blamin' anybody.
-Now. that's insane.

270
00:17:35.526 --> 00:17:36.225
You know.
anybody else who she was--

271
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.757
No. no. please. it's insulting.

272
00:17:37.792 --> 00:17:39.132
What are you talkin' about.
Barry!

273
00:17:39.167 --> 00:17:39.899
-I'm not blaming anybody!
-- Okay.

274
00:17:39.935 --> 00:17:41.167
-You did!
-- I-- I'm just--

275
00:17:41.203 --> 00:17:42.268
That-- that was the implication.
Do you have any friends here?

276
00:17:42.304 --> 00:17:43.532
I asked if you knew
she was coming here.

277
00:17:43.567 --> 00:17:46.139
Okay!

278
00:17:46.174 --> 00:17:48.438
Okay. guys.
you can think what you want.

279
00:17:48.473 --> 00:17:50.242
but this is me. Will. all right?

280
00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:51.606
-No. I--
-- I-- I-- and this--

281
00:17:51.641 --> 00:17:53.410
I know.
but it's not Will and Lisa.

282
00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:54.807
You see.
we were expecting Will and Lisa.

283
00:17:54.842 --> 00:17:56.215
Yeah. okay.

284
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.679
Well. let's get
about finding Lisa. okay?

285
00:17:58.714 --> 00:18:00.186
I'm uh. I gotta go by.

286
00:18:00.221 --> 00:18:01.087
I called the police

287
00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:02.650
and they're comin'
at the gas station.

288
00:18:02.685 --> 00:18:04.223
-You guys stay here.
-Okay.

289
00:18:04.258 --> 00:18:05.686
Just in case she comes.

290
00:18:05.721 --> 00:18:07.589
And maybe call her friends.
see if anybody heard from her.

291
00:18:07.624 --> 00:18:08.523
-- Right.
-- Yeah.

292
00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:09.789
Right? And call me
if you're hear anything.

293
00:18:09.824 --> 00:18:11.230
-I will. I promise.
-Of course.

294
00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:12.693
-- All right.

295
00:18:12.728 --> 00:18:13.859
Oh my God.

296
00:18:13.894 --> 00:18:14.626
No. we're gonna call the cops
right now.

297
00:18:14.662 --> 00:18:15.527
What do you mean
call her friends?

298
00:18:15.563 --> 00:18:17.269
-What the fuck is that?
-I don't ev--

299
00:18:17.304 --> 00:18:18.203
I don't understand what he said.

300
00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:18.804
I don't even know
if I believe him

301
00:18:18.839 --> 00:18:20.272
that he called the cops..

302
00:18:20.307 --> 00:18:21.702
I don't either.
I don't trust him!

303
00:18:21.737 --> 00:18:23.209
This doesn't make any sense.

304
00:18:23.244 --> 00:18:24.870
Oh. it makes sense to me.

305
00:18:24.905 --> 00:18:27.345
Uh. he was acting weird.

306
00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.511
Did you see him?

307
00:19:21.797 --> 00:19:23.401
Ooh!

308
00:19:23.436 --> 00:19:25.304
Hey.

309
00:19:25.339 --> 00:19:27.339
I got the steering column
workin'.

310
00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:28.073
Oh yeah?

311
00:19:28.108 --> 00:19:30.342
Yeah. cables were-- were fried.

312
00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:32.311
Oh. Hmm.

313
00:19:32.346 --> 00:19:33.774
Maybe it's time to get her wet.

314
00:19:35.481 --> 00:19:38.713
-You want a drink?
-No. No. thanks.

315
00:19:38.748 --> 00:19:40.649
-Okay. I'm gonna have a beer.
-Okay.

316
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:46.292
You okay?

317
00:19:47.955 --> 00:19:48.987
No.

318
00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:50.329
What's the matter?

319
00:19:51.926 --> 00:19:53.332
Will. um...

320
00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:58.799
-I think we need a break.
-Oh. Christ.

321
00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:09.381
W-- i-- i-- uh. is it the work?

322
00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:11.878
I mean I know
I've not been around so much.

323
00:20:11.913 --> 00:20:13.781
but at least I'm almost finished
with this stuff.

324
00:20:13.816 --> 00:20:14.482
I told you
there's gonna be a few--

325
00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:15.849
I know. I know. Uh--

326
00:20:15.884 --> 00:20:17.290
I understand.

327
00:20:17.325 --> 00:20:22.427
It's just...
I don't actually know what it is

328
00:20:22.462 --> 00:20:23.161
and that's the problem.

329
00:20:23.196 --> 00:20:24.924
I can't fix what I don't know--

330
00:20:24.959 --> 00:20:26.464
Well. that's fucking great.
isn't it?

331
00:20:26.499 --> 00:20:27.828
So. you don't know what's wrong.

332
00:20:27.863 --> 00:20:29.698
You don't communicate to me
what's wrong. Is it--

333
00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:31.304
I'm trying to communicate
to you right now

334
00:20:31.339 --> 00:20:32.305
and is this how
you're gonna behave?

335
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.172
Yeah. yeah. well.
what is it this time. Lisa?

336
00:20:33.208 --> 00:20:35.033
-Your depression?
-I'm not depressed.

337
00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:37.607
Uh. you're unfulfilled again.
because we know what happens

338
00:20:37.642 --> 00:20:38.773
when you're unfulfilled.

339
00:20:38.808 --> 00:20:41.479
We've been there.
I dealt with that.

340
00:20:41.514 --> 00:20:42.513
But that's not enough.

341
00:20:49.423 --> 00:20:50.818
-I'm sorry.
-D-- No. it's--

342
00:20:50.853 --> 00:20:52.952
I'm sorry. I'm sorry that--
Uh. I'm sorry.

343
00:20:55.594 --> 00:21:01.026
I don't feel anything anymore.

344
00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:02.599
It's like I'm just numb.

345
00:21:02.634 --> 00:21:03.897
That's the worst part of it.

346
00:21:03.932 --> 00:21:06.768
I can't even pinpoint why

347
00:21:06.803 --> 00:21:09.771
and I think some time apart
would be really beneficial.

348
00:21:09.806 --> 00:21:13.412
Get some clarity. some space.

349
00:21:30.926 --> 00:21:32.728
-Detective Paterson.
-Mr. Spann?

350
00:21:32.763 --> 00:21:34.499
-- Yeah.
-All right.

351
00:21:34.534 --> 00:21:37.601
-Any uh. news about your wife?
-No.

352
00:21:37.636 --> 00:21:39.801
It's--
it's an hour and a half now.

353
00:21:39.836 --> 00:21:41.506
I-- I haven't seen her.

354
00:21:41.541 --> 00:21:43.376
I-- I went to her parents' house
in Emerson

355
00:21:43.411 --> 00:21:45.411
and she didn't
show up there either.

356
00:21:45.446 --> 00:21:46.907
Why would you go there?

357
00:21:46.942 --> 00:21:47.908
Well.
that's where I was takin' her.

358
00:21:47.943 --> 00:21:50.108
I thought maybe she--
she would go by there.

359
00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:51.846
But we asked you to stay here.

360
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:52.979
'cause she could have
come back here.

361
00:21:53.014 --> 00:21:53.980
Look.
I'm clutchin' the straws here.

362
00:21:54.015 --> 00:21:56.521
I-- I don't really know
what the protocol is

363
00:21:56.556 --> 00:21:57.885
for a missing wife.

364
00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.458
So yeah. I took action
and I went lookin' for her.

365
00:21:59.493 --> 00:22:00.525
-All right. uh--
-I don't know what the--

366
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.461
What are her parents' names?

367
00:22:02.496 --> 00:22:04.958
Uh. Anna and Barry Adams.

368
00:22:04.993 --> 00:22:06.795
Oh. the Adams.
I know the Adams a little bit.

369
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.665
Good people.

370
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.666
Yeah. the good people. yeah.

371
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:12.735
Did she um. leave behind
any personal belongings?

372
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.000
-A purse?
-Yeah. yeah.

373
00:22:14.035 --> 00:22:15.936
-I found her purse in the car.
-Okay.

374
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.975
And I have her computer as well.

375
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.976
Okay. well. hold on to that.

376
00:22:23.011 --> 00:22:25.110
Let me just look at this.

377
00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:26.144
You have her phone. do you. huh?

378
00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:27.684
No. I think she had her phone.

379
00:22:27.719 --> 00:22:30.489
I-- I-- I tried Find My Phone.
but it must be off.

380
00:22:30.524 --> 00:22:32.788
All right. Let's head inside.

381
00:22:37.498 --> 00:22:38.827
Oscar.

382
00:22:38.862 --> 00:22:39.993
Detective.

383
00:22:40.028 --> 00:22:41.159
Uh. what you need? Coffee?

384
00:22:41.194 --> 00:22:43.128
No. no. I need the uh.
camera footage

385
00:22:43.163 --> 00:22:44.866
from the surveillance.

386
00:22:44.901 --> 00:22:46.769
Uh. the camera's been busted
a couple weeks.

387
00:22:46.804 --> 00:22:47.603
I got a guy comin' out.

388
00:22:47.638 --> 00:22:49.002
but they keep sayin'
they comin' out.

389
00:22:49.037 --> 00:22:50.443
Nobody showed up yet.

390
00:22:50.478 --> 00:22:52.203
Well. this man says
his wife is missing.

391
00:22:52.238 --> 00:22:53.743
You've been sitting here
all day.

392
00:22:53.778 --> 00:22:55.712
-Did you see anybody?
-I-- I didn't seen a thing.

You wanna come with me?
I can take a full statement.

396
00:23:03.722 --> 00:23:06.591
No. I think I--
I'm gonna stay here.

397
00:23:06.626 --> 00:23:08.791
-Just in case she shows up.
-All right.

398
00:23:08.826 --> 00:23:11.629
You mind if I-- computer.

399
00:23:11.664 --> 00:23:12.630
Do you know what's the code?

400
00:23:14.634 --> 00:23:16.161
No. I-- I--
she didn't give it to me.

401
00:23:16.196 --> 00:23:17.569
Uh. don't worry.

402
00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:18.933

413
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.631
-It's 'cause it's busted.
-Right.

414
00:24:52.666 --> 00:24:54.600
See. I know a thing
about these uh. cameras.

415
00:24:54.635 --> 00:24:58.736
I've worked quite a few
and uh. that's live.

416
00:24:58.771 --> 00:25:00.804
It's workin'.

417
00:25:00.839 --> 00:25:03.103
No. it must-- uh.

418
00:25:03.138 --> 00:25:04.302
-or something--
-What are you playin' on?

419
00:25:04.337 --> 00:25:05.470
What are you talking about?

420
00:25:05.505 --> 00:25:07.646
What are you playin' on?

You might have no feed.

448
00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:22.017
Hi there.

I thought it was broken.

456
00:26:34.328 --> 00:26:37.197
Yeah. so did I.

457
00:26:37.232 --> 00:26:38.671
Oscar gave it to me.

458
00:26:38.706 --> 00:26:40.101
That damn Oscar.

459
00:26:40.136 --> 00:26:41.036

Hey. Mike! Heads up. incoming.

461
00:26:53.017 --> 00:26:54.819
One second.

Your man Oscar is connected
with this. by the way.

463
00:26:58.759 --> 00:27:00.693
-Okay. All right
-I'm just--

00:27:13.906 --> 00:27:14.839
-Back up a little bit.
-Got it.

468
00:27:14.874 --> 00:27:16.676
Back up a little bit.
A couple of minutes.

469
00:27:19.109 --> 00:27:20.042
So. that-- would-- that's it?

470
00:27:20.077 --> 00:27:22.044
No. no. That's-- that's not her.

471
00:27:22.079 --> 00:27:23.441
No. you gotta go--
go back some more.

472
00:27:26.886 --> 00:27:28.380
There she-- there--
that's her comin' out.

473
00:27:42.198 --> 00:27:44.363
All right. who's that man?

474
00:27:46.136 --> 00:27:47.069
I don't--
I don't know who that is.

475
00:27:47.104 --> 00:27:49.203
I-- I--

476
00:27:49.238 --> 00:27:51.843
He seems to know
who your wife is.

477
00:27:51.878 --> 00:27:53.174
I've never seen him in my life.

478
00:28:02.251 --> 00:28:03.756
Oh. this fuckin' truck.

479
00:28:05.287 --> 00:28:07.155
Well...

480
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:08.992
Come on. Come on. move it.

481
00:28:15.066 --> 00:28:16.769
Okay. wait. wait. he-- he--
he has her.

482
00:28:16.804 --> 00:28:17.837
He's have to taken her.

483
00:28:17.872 --> 00:28:18.804
-All right. all right.
-That's-- that's your man.

484
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.070
We'll have some guys
look into it. all right?

485
00:28:21.105 --> 00:28:22.302
-Anderson. why don't you go--
-Can you go back in on him?

486
00:28:22.337 --> 00:28:23.776
Track down Oscar. all right?

487
00:28:23.811 --> 00:28:24.643
Yeah.

488
00:28:24.679 --> 00:28:25.478
I bet he knows who this guy is.

489
00:28:25.513 --> 00:28:27.373
-Thank you.
-All right. thank you.

490
00:28:27.408 --> 00:28:28.847
All right. in the meantime.

491
00:28:28.882 --> 00:28:29.714
you mind
if we go in another room.

492
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.377
I ask you a few questions
in private?

493
00:28:31.412 --> 00:28:32.477
-Yeah. sure. let's do it.
-- All right.

494
00:28:36.384 --> 00:28:37.856
Follow me.

495
00:28:42.126 --> 00:28:44.522
Come on in. have a seat.

496
00:28:51.432 --> 00:28:54.499
<i>Uh. some water?</i>

497
00:28:54.534 --> 00:28:55.566
<i>Coffee or anything?</i>

498
00:28:55.601 --> 00:28:57.909
<i>No. I'm good.</i>

499
00:28:57.944 --> 00:29:02.111
So. you sure you don't know
who that man is?

500
00:29:02.146 --> 00:29:04.542
No. I've never seen him before
in my life. Uh. no.

501
00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:06.049
Okay. no. it's-- it's okay.

502
00:29:06.084 --> 00:29:09.250
I mean he just seemed
to uh. have a--

503
00:29:09.285 --> 00:29:10.581
Be pretty familiar
with your wife.

504
00:29:10.616 --> 00:29:12.583
-Th-- that's all.
-I don't know.

505
00:29:12.618 --> 00:29:15.322
I mean uh. doesn't look
like the kinda person

506
00:29:15.357 --> 00:29:16.521
that Lisa would be friends with.

507
00:29:16.556 --> 00:29:18.094
-Okay.
-I-- I know her pretty well.

508
00:29:18.129 --> 00:29:19.458
All right.

509
00:29:19.493 --> 00:29:21.031
So Lisa's from her.
she's got friends from here.

510
00:29:21.066 --> 00:29:22.329
Do you--
do you know any of them?

511
00:29:22.364 --> 00:29:26.366
No. I don't really know
any of her friends.

512
00:29:26.401 --> 00:29:29.171
She-- she didn't really talk
about her high school.

513
00:29:31.076 --> 00:29:32.207
That's unusual.

514
00:29:35.278 --> 00:29:37.883
So you were um. on your way
to Lisa's folks' house. right?

515
00:29:37.918 --> 00:29:40.314
Uh. Adams. in Emerson?

516
00:29:40.349 --> 00:29:42.118
Yeah. Like I said.
I was takin' her there

517
00:29:42.153 --> 00:29:43.482
to drop her off. yeah.

518
00:29:45.156 --> 00:29:48.520
You know. I--
I have to ask you um...

519
00:29:48.555 --> 00:29:50.027
how's your marriage?

520
00:29:53.593 --> 00:29:55.164
Where are we going with this?
I don't-- I don't--

521
00:30:07.915 --> 00:30:10.179
We-- we-- we were--

522
00:30:10.214 --> 00:30:13.083
We're going
through a rough time.

523
00:30:13.118 --> 00:30:15.217
Oh. so it was gonna be a--
a separation?

524
00:30:15.252 --> 00:30:16.581
No. it's not a separation.

525
00:30:16.616 --> 00:30:19.155
She just said she needed
a bit of a break. that's all.

526
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.156
So not a divorce?

527
00:30:20.191 --> 00:30:24.061
No. not-- I don't get
the relevance of this.

528
00:30:28.199 --> 00:30:29.396
Do you and your wife um...

529
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.938
-You guys fight?
-No.

530
00:30:34.469 --> 00:30:36.073
No. there's just been
some tension.

531
00:30:36.108 --> 00:30:40.407
We don't fight. we don't scream.
we don't shout.

532
00:30:40.442 --> 00:30:41.375
So did you have a fight
on the way here?

533
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:43.410
No. we did not have a fight
in the way here.

534
00:30:45.645 --> 00:30:46.611
Okay.

535
00:30:48.714 --> 00:30:53.959
So. you told me that your wife
may have walked home from the--

536
00:30:53.994 --> 00:30:55.653
from the station. right?

537
00:30:55.688 --> 00:30:57.061
I mean so why would she--

538
00:30:57.096 --> 00:30:59.591
I didn't know. detec--
I didn't know.

539
00:30:59.626 --> 00:31:00.658
Why do you think
she would go there without you?

540
00:31:00.693 --> 00:31:02.066
That mean if she did.

541
00:31:02.101 --> 00:31:03.331
it would imply
maybe you had an argument.

542
00:31:03.366 --> 00:31:05.531
Yeah. it was a mistake.
it didn't make sense.

543
00:31:05.566 --> 00:31:07.335
I didn't know what to do.

544
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:08.403
But she-- why would she do that
if you guys didn't have a fight?

545
00:31:08.438 --> 00:31:10.173
You know. I mean we always
can get a little hot.

546
00:31:10.208 --> 00:31:11.174
heated in the car.

547
00:31:11.209 --> 00:31:12.472
Why are we wasting time here?

548
00:31:12.507 --> 00:31:15.211
Like just--

549
00:31:16.412 --> 00:31:18.984
Look. there's been some tension.

550
00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.583
-My wife's an amazing woman.
-Okay.

551
00:31:24.618 --> 00:31:27.388
-Best woman I ever met.
-Mmhmm.

552
00:31:27.423 --> 00:31:28.653
But she has
a darkness inside her

553
00:31:28.688 --> 00:31:30.028
and sometimes...

554
00:31:32.461 --> 00:31:34.032
...she withdraws. I don't know.

555
00:31:34.067 --> 00:31:36.397
She's been there for me
through a lot of stuff and...

556
00:31:40.073 --> 00:31:41.171
now she's
goin' through some stuff.

557
00:31:41.206 --> 00:31:42.700
I'm just tryin'
to be there for her.

558
00:31:44.275 --> 00:31:46.308
Okay.

559
00:31:46.343 --> 00:31:47.474
Where do you live. Will?

560
00:31:49.247 --> 00:31:51.610
I live in Manchester.
New Hampshire.

561
00:31:53.416 --> 00:31:55.416
And what do you do for a living?

562
00:31:58.091 --> 00:32:00.454
I'm a real estate developer.

563
00:32:02.326 --> 00:32:03.996
There's lots of money
in real estate. right?

564
00:32:06.165 --> 00:32:08.462
-Lots of cash exchanges hands.
-Yeah.

565
00:32:08.497 --> 00:32:10.167
A lot of unsavory characters.

566
00:32:10.202 --> 00:32:12.367
Yeah. there's some.
but not at a gas station

567
00:32:12.402 --> 00:32:14.369
in Emerson.

568
00:32:14.404 --> 00:32:17.108
Disgruntled employees sometimes.

569
00:32:17.143 --> 00:32:19.143
-Disgruntled employees.
-No. I--

570
00:32:19.178 --> 00:32:20.573
Just like you know.

571
00:32:20.608 --> 00:32:21.673
they don't like the way
they've been treated.

572
00:32:21.708 --> 00:32:22.982
the way they've been paid.

573
00:32:26.251 --> 00:32:29.054
I'm a good boss. okay?

574
00:32:29.089 --> 00:32:32.585
I really don't see how
that going on in Manchester

575
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.719
is gonna have
any fucking bearing

576
00:32:34.754 --> 00:32:36.127
in what is happening here in--

577
00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:37.689
You uh.
do a lot of work on the road?

578
00:32:37.724 --> 00:32:41.198
You go some prospecting.
so to speak. speculating?

579
00:32:41.233 --> 00:32:43.662
Looking at property.
lookin' at land?

580
00:32:43.697 --> 00:32:45.334
Takes you away from the city
a little bit?

581
00:32:45.369 --> 00:32:48.106
No. I don't leave so much.

582
00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:49.536
I work a lot.
I'm away from the house a lot.

583
00:32:49.571 --> 00:32:50.537
Work a lot--
away from the house.

584
00:32:50.572 --> 00:32:52.011
But I don't leave town
so much. No.

585
00:32:53.773 --> 00:32:55.410
All right. so now it's-- what?

586
00:32:55.445 --> 00:32:56.774
-- No. no. no.
-What? What?

587
00:32:59.449 --> 00:33:00.613
Have you ever had an affair?

588
00:33:02.617 --> 00:33:05.783
There's two guys
in here talkin'. right?

589
00:33:05.818 --> 00:33:06.650
We all-- we all-- every--

590
00:33:06.686 --> 00:33:09.094
Every guy has a wandering eye.
right?

591
00:33:17.203 --> 00:33:19.302
No. I haven't had an affair.

592
00:33:19.337 --> 00:33:20.435
Has your wife?

593
00:33:26.245 --> 00:33:27.673
Yeah. Yeah.

594
00:33:32.416 --> 00:33:33.514
How long ago was that?

595
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.815
Uh. it was about...

596
00:33:40.457 --> 00:33:41.720
six months ago.

597
00:33:44.395 --> 00:33:45.724
Do you have life insurance
on your wife?

598
00:33:50.368 --> 00:33:51.598
Yeah.

599
00:33:51.633 --> 00:33:53.864
How much?

600
00:33:53.899 --> 00:33:55.338
I don't know.

601
00:33:55.373 --> 00:33:56.372
A couple million.

602
00:33:58.607 --> 00:34:00.541
The standard. right?

603
00:34:00.576 --> 00:34:01.609
Well. no. I mean I--
I don't know.

604
00:34:01.644 --> 00:34:03.709
I make cop money.
I don't make development money.

605
00:34:03.744 --> 00:34:07.416
Okay. so I've abducted my wife
and I'm gonna kill her.

606
00:34:07.451 --> 00:34:09.451
I-- I'm gonna cash out
in a huge insurance policy.

607
00:34:09.486 --> 00:34:10.551
That's what this is all about?

608
00:34:10.586 --> 00:34:11.218
Well. okay.
that's what's happening.

609
00:34:11.254 --> 00:34:12.386
I gotta cover all the bases.

610
00:34:12.421 --> 00:34:15.325
No. my wife. right now. could be
three fucking states away

611
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.722
and you're sitting in here
askin' me

612
00:34:16.757 --> 00:34:19.560
ben-fuckin'-ign questions

613
00:34:19.595 --> 00:34:22.497
that I've got nothing to do
with what has happened to her!

614
00:34:22.532 --> 00:34:24.598
Something drastic
has to happen here. Detective.

615
00:34:24.633 --> 00:34:26.138
I need your fucking help.

616
00:34:26.173 --> 00:34:27.733
Or should I just go
and do it myself?

617
00:34:30.672 --> 00:34:32.408
Why would I bring you
the evidence?

618
00:34:33.807 --> 00:34:35.741
You might be clever
than most people.

619
00:34:35.776 --> 00:34:38.282
-I don't know.
-Oh. Christ.

620
00:34:38.317 --> 00:34:39.778
-You're a smart man.
-- Yeah.

621
00:34:39.813 --> 00:34:42.187
Developer. Make a lot of money.

622
00:34:42.222 --> 00:34:43.650
Am I free to go?

623
00:34:43.685 --> 00:34:45.916
Anytime you want.

624
00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:47.720
We have your name.
we have your number.

625
00:34:47.755 --> 00:34:49.557
we'll be in touch.

626
00:34:49.592 --> 00:34:50.358
Do you have a photo
of your wife?

627
00:34:50.393 --> 00:34:51.823
Yeah.
I have a photo of my wife.

628
00:34:59.272 --> 00:35:00.766
Okay. be right back.

629
00:35:31.469 --> 00:35:33.964
I mean he looks suspicious
as hell. right?

630
00:35:33.999 --> 00:35:35.306
He seems
like a little wild card.

631
00:35:35.341 --> 00:35:36.340
I don't know.

632
00:35:36.375 --> 00:35:37.308
Mmhmm.

633
00:35:51.621 --> 00:35:52.818
<i>Morning. sleepyhead.</i>

634
00:35:53.854 --> 00:35:56.261
-What are you makin'?
-Well...

635
00:35:56.296 --> 00:35:57.856
Are you trying
to make breakfast?

636
00:35:59.827 --> 00:36:02.234
<i>Guess what I just got.</i>

637
00:36:02.269 --> 00:36:03.400
What?

638
00:36:03.435 --> 00:36:05.402
Remember Nate's contract
that I was up for?

639
00:36:05.437 --> 00:36:06.436
-Yeah.
-- The meeting I had.

640
00:36:06.471 --> 00:36:07.932
Mmhmm.

641
00:36:07.967 --> 00:36:09.439
I got the God job!

642
00:36:09.474 --> 00:36:10.803
-No. you didn't!
-I did!

643
00:36:10.838 --> 00:36:12.244
-Oh. my God!

644
00:36:16.778 --> 00:36:18.547
We got so much goin' for it.

645
00:36:18.582 --> 00:36:20.252
You just gotta look uh--
look. look. what we have!

646
00:36:20.287 --> 00:36:21.385
We have a beautiful life.

647
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.716
I know we've been through shit.
but...

648
00:36:24.324 --> 00:36:25.554
we worked hard for this.

649
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:29.294
I mean... we've got
some more gas in the tank.

650
00:36:53.518 --> 00:36:55.815
-Barry. Anna.
-Yeah. we're in here.

651
00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:56.816
You guys hear anything?

652
00:36:56.851 --> 00:36:58.719
-- Yes. no.
-- Yeah. yeah. right. no.

653
00:36:58.754 --> 00:37:00.523
-- You?
-Uh. the cops put out an APB.

654
00:37:00.558 --> 00:37:03.295
-Okay. I knew that.
-Okay.

655
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:04.626
All right. so listen.
I found something.

656
00:37:04.661 --> 00:37:05.990
-I wanna show you guys.
-- Yeah.

657
00:37:06.025 --> 00:37:09.466
We got it off that CCTV camera.

658
00:37:09.501 --> 00:37:10.797
Okay. you know this guy?

659
00:37:10.832 --> 00:37:12.469
I can't really see very well
from here.

660
00:37:12.504 --> 00:37:14.471
Anna. do you see--
I can't see without my glasses.

661
00:37:14.506 --> 00:37:15.868
-- Hold on.
-- Um...

662
00:37:15.903 --> 00:37:16.869
-- You know him?
-That's hard to tell from here.

663
00:37:16.904 --> 00:37:18.376
but it looks a little bit like--

664
00:37:18.411 --> 00:37:19.509
-Oh yeah. that's Knuckles.
-A bit like--.

665
00:37:19.544 --> 00:37:20.972
-Yeah. He--
-That-- that's Knuckles.

666
00:37:21.007 --> 00:37:22.006
That's our handyman.

667
00:37:22.042 --> 00:37:23.274
-He's done some work around.
-He works for you?

668
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:25.647
-No. he work-- does odd jobs.
-This guy looks like a creep.

669
00:37:25.682 --> 00:37:26.945
He's a friend of Lisa's.

670
00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.584
I mean they've known each other
since school.

671
00:37:28.619 --> 00:37:29.518
It's none-- and he--

672
00:37:29.554 --> 00:37:30.786
I wouldn't call him
a friend of Lisa's.

673
00:37:30.821 --> 00:37:32.753
-They knew each other when--
-Alright. g-- guys. okay. okay.

674
00:37:32.788 --> 00:37:35.019
So just--
does she know him enough

675
00:37:35.054 --> 00:37:36.427
to get in a car with him?

676
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:39.958
I don't know.

677
00:37:39.993 --> 00:37:41.597
And do you think this guy
would do her any harm?

678
00:37:44.536 --> 00:37:46.536
Wait a minute. Can I see this?

679
00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:47.504
-- Is that his car?
-- Yeah. it's his car. Yeah.

680
00:37:47.539 --> 00:37:49.099
-I've seen this car.
-Really? I don't know.

681
00:37:49.134 --> 00:37:50.233
-Where did you see it?
-Yes. I did.

682
00:37:50.269 --> 00:37:52.674
I saw-- I saw it when I went up
to um. Archer Grove

683
00:37:52.709 --> 00:37:53.873
-for the-- the garage ser--
-Morrison?

684
00:37:53.908 --> 00:37:54.775
-Yes!
-Really?

685
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:55.974
It was in the back.

686
00:37:56.009 --> 00:37:56.741
-All right.
-Uh. in the hangar things.

687
00:37:56.777 --> 00:37:57.709
Okay. good. good. good.

688
00:37:57.744 --> 00:37:58.944
Good. now is--

00:42:25.551 --> 00:42:27.751

You know where she is.

726
00:42:27.786 --> 00:42:29.280
-Listen. you fucking calm down.
-- Tell me.

727
00:42:29.315 --> 00:42:31.084
-- Where the fuck is she?
-You fucking calm down.

728
00:42:31.119 --> 00:42:32.756
-- You calm down. just--
-Stay back. stay back.

You're the one

731
00:42:36.058 --> 00:42:37.860
-Come on.
-Stop!

732
00:42:37.895 --> 00:42:38.993
-- Oh fuck!

733
00:42:39.028 --> 00:42:41.127
-Okay. stop! Stop. stop!

734
00:42:41.162 --> 00:42:43.063
I swear to God
I'll smash your fucking skull!

735

Where the fuck is she?

736
00:43:04.823 --> 00:43:05.888
Okay.

737
00:43:11.929 --> 00:43:13.060
-Oh!

Fuckin' talk to me!

739
00:43:14.195 --> 00:43:16.734
I didn't wanna leave her
with Frank.

740
00:43:16.769 --> 00:43:19.429
Right? He made me...

741
00:43:19.464 --> 00:43:20.738
Who's Frank?

742
00:43:21.873 --> 00:43:23.774
Tell me. you fuckin' prick.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.273
Stop. stop. Stop. stop. stop.

Stop. Oh. stop!

745
00:44:15.993 --> 00:44:17.894
I'll get you to Frank.

746
00:44:17.929 --> 00:44:21.095
She said she had a trailer.

747
00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:22.767
Where they sell.

748
00:44:22.802 --> 00:44:25.495
She's with Frank.

749
00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.805
I'll take you. I'll take you.

750
00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.973

-Come here. you piece of shit.

752
00:45:16.119 --> 00:45:18.416
I'll take you to--

753
00:45:18.451 --> 00:45:20.253
I'll take you--

754
00:45:25.095 --> 00:45:27.062
I didn't wanna leave her.

755
00:45:27.097 --> 00:45:28.965
They made me leave her.

756
00:45:31.134 --> 00:45:34.267
Okay. I'll go.

757
00:45:34.302 --> 00:45:37.402
Just sto-- just hold it. No.

758
00:45:39.142 --> 00:45:42.440
Okay. okay. Uh. okay.

759
00:46:08.633 --> 00:46:10.039
Oscar!

760
00:46:14.243 --> 00:46:15.374
Where's Oscar?

761
00:46:15.409 --> 00:46:17.046
He worked earlier today.

762
00:46:17.081 --> 00:46:20.016
Well. listen. you tell him
he can call me at the station.

763
00:46:20.051 --> 00:46:21.611
come down see me at the station.
write me at the station.

764
00:46:21.646 --> 00:46:23.547
but he better come find me.

765
00:46:23.582 --> 00:46:25.582
If not. I'm comin' back
and I'm closing the place up.

766
00:46:25.617 --> 00:46:26.550
You understand?

767
00:46:47.606 --> 00:46:48.847
Shit.

768
00:47:03.061 --> 00:47:04.390
Just shut up. okay?

769
00:47:06.163 --> 00:47:08.064
Or you and I'll both be in jail.

770
00:47:24.577 --> 00:47:26.049
How you doin' today. sir?

771
00:47:26.084 --> 00:47:27.347
Good.

772
00:47:27.382 --> 00:47:29.151
You know why I stopped you?

773
00:47:29.186 --> 00:47:31.923
Yeah. I know I was--
I was speeding.

774
00:47:31.958 --> 00:47:35.421
A little fast. 82 on a 55.

775
00:47:35.456 --> 00:47:37.093
I get your license
and registration?

776
00:47:37.128 --> 00:47:40.195
Yeah. I was just in a bit of a--
you know. family emergency.

777
00:47:43.365 --> 00:47:44.661
Here you go.

778
00:47:44.696 --> 00:47:46.069
My-- uh.

779
00:47:49.536 --> 00:47:50.469
That's my--

780
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:55.111
You don't live around here?

781
00:47:55.146 --> 00:47:57.146
-No. I live in Manchester.
-Mmhmm.

782
00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:00.347
You had some trouble today?

783
00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:05.088
Oh. That was uh...

784
00:48:05.123 --> 00:48:07.354
I was uh. j-- just
choppin' wood up at the cabin.

785
00:48:10.656 --> 00:48:11.930
I'll be right back.

786
00:48:20.567 --> 00:48:23.337
Shh! Fuck!

787
00:48:43.689 --> 00:48:45.392
Would you mind steppin'
out of the vehicle please?

788
00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.693
Why. officer?
It's just a traffic violation.

789
00:48:49.728 --> 00:48:51.398
Hey. just step
out of the vehicle for a minute.

790
00:48:51.433 --> 00:48:54.368
We'll get this over with
pretty quick.

791
00:48:54.403 --> 00:48:55.600
Sure. Yeah.

792
00:49:02.279 --> 00:49:03.178
Thank you.

793
00:49:03.214 --> 00:49:04.642
-Can you just uh--
-- Yeah.

794
00:49:04.677 --> 00:49:07.018
-Give me a ticket?
-- No.

795
00:49:07.053 --> 00:49:08.580
-I'm uh--
-You just step over there.

796
00:49:20.198 --> 00:49:22.528
Whose bags are these?

797
00:49:22.563 --> 00:49:23.595
My wife's.

798
00:49:26.204 --> 00:49:27.335
That's a lot of bags.

799
00:49:29.372 --> 00:49:31.339
Yeah. she likes her clothes.

800
00:49:33.541 --> 00:49:34.705
Where's your wife?

801
00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.080
Manchester.

802
00:49:55.629 --> 00:49:57.233
Do you mind poppin' the trunk
please?

803
00:49:59.237 --> 00:50:00.269
Sure.

804
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:07.573
Hey. stop! Stop right there!

805
00:50:12.217 --> 00:50:13.579
Dispatch. this is 5-7.

806
00:50:13.614 --> 00:50:15.680
I need a 20. Repeat. the 20.

807
00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.835
Detective?

808
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:39.836
Yeah.

809
00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:43.609
-- Thank you.
-You're welcome.

810
00:50:43.644 --> 00:50:45.413
Thanks.

811
00:50:45.448 --> 00:50:46.843
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

812
00:50:46.878 --> 00:50:48.251
I appreciate you guys
takin' the time.

813
00:50:48.286 --> 00:50:50.220
I just have to ask you
a few questions.

814
00:50:50.255 --> 00:50:51.320
Absolutely.

815
00:50:51.355 --> 00:50:52.717
Do you know a guy named "Clint"?

816
00:50:54.688 --> 00:50:58.129
Um. yeah.
it was the man Lisa was seeing.

817
00:50:58.164 --> 00:51:00.131
It was-- it was briefly.

818
00:51:00.166 --> 00:51:01.165
-- Yeah.
-It was like months ago.

819
00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.167
Yeah. that's what I figured.

820
00:51:03.202 --> 00:51:06.401
Um. do you think your son-in-law
was straying?

821
00:51:06.436 --> 00:51:07.567
No.

822
00:51:07.602 --> 00:51:09.338
No. that comes straight
from Lisa.

823
00:51:09.373 --> 00:51:11.472
He had nothing to do with that.

824
00:51:37.335 --> 00:51:38.468
We bypassed her password

825
00:51:38.503 --> 00:51:41.469
and we saw the last three emails
came from this Clint guy.

826
00:51:41.504 --> 00:51:43.240
-- Right.
-- He kept asking to see her.

827
00:51:43.275 --> 00:51:44.835
And did she answer his emails?

828
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:46.837
Not once.

829
00:51:46.872 --> 00:51:49.444
Are you still seeing Clint?

830
00:51:49.479 --> 00:51:50.709
No.

831
00:51:50.744 --> 00:51:52.249
No. that was one night.

832
00:51:53.813 --> 00:51:54.912
I'm-- I'm alone. mom.

833
00:51:54.948 --> 00:51:57.650
and that is exactly what I want
for the time being.

834
00:52:08.498 --> 00:52:10.894
Yeah. you mean--

835
00:52:13.404 --> 00:52:14.203
You wanna be able to do

836
00:52:14.238 --> 00:52:17.208
what you wanna be able
to do again.

837
00:52:17.243 --> 00:52:21.542
so you have your break.
you have your fun.

838
00:52:21.577 --> 00:52:22.708
and I'll just go with it.

839
00:52:24.415 --> 00:52:26.547
He must be mad at you.

840
00:52:26.582 --> 00:52:27.911
he's not really the type
to get mad

841
00:52:27.946 --> 00:52:28.845
and you know that.

842
00:52:28.881 --> 00:52:31.255
Sweetheart.
I'm sorry I don't buy that.

843
00:52:34.392 --> 00:52:36.788
Fuck. Fuck!

844
00:52:49.275 --> 00:52:51.869
We contacted Boston PD.
that's where Clint lives now.

845
00:52:51.904 --> 00:52:53.904
and uh. we had some--
some tech people

846
00:52:53.939 --> 00:52:56.511
search all of his electronics
to see if he had hired anyone.

847
00:52:56.546 --> 00:53:00.746
They did a thorough search
and it came up unsuccessful.

848
00:53:00.781 --> 00:53:03.881
Now um. Knuckles knew
what Lisa looked like.

849
00:53:03.916 --> 00:53:05.817
because he saw the--
the pictures in your place.

850
00:53:05.852 --> 00:53:07.258
Is that right?

851
00:53:07.293 --> 00:53:08.490
Well. I mean he knew her
when they were kids.

852
00:53:08.525 --> 00:53:09.953
-they went to school together.
-Right.

853
00:53:09.988 --> 00:53:11.955
Okay.

854
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:13.528
And you said
you saw Knuckles' car

855
00:53:13.563 --> 00:53:14.529
at the Morrison's. right?

856
00:53:14.564 --> 00:53:15.794
Yes. I drove by there
a couple of weeks ago

857
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:17.334
and I saw it there.

858
00:53:17.369 --> 00:53:18.929
And then I-- I do remember
seeing it another time.

859
00:53:18.964 --> 00:53:22.273
I just-- I don't recall exactly
when that was.

860
00:53:22.308 --> 00:53:24.506
Doesn't matter.
I was there an hour ago.

861
00:53:24.541 --> 00:53:25.837
-And?
-And?

862
00:53:25.872 --> 00:53:27.575
His trailer's empty.

863
00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:30.677
Well. can you send a chopper.
survey the area?

864
00:53:30.712 --> 00:53:33.042
I mean they-- you can't let them
disappear like that.

865
00:53:33.077 --> 00:53:34.549
There's a suspect on the run.

866
00:53:34.584 --> 00:53:35.781
No. there is not.

867
00:53:35.816 --> 00:53:37.585
No. no. you--
well. how do you mean?

868
00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:39.356
Well. suspect of what?

869
00:53:39.391 --> 00:53:41.523
In all logic.
Lisa should be here now.

870
00:53:41.558 --> 00:53:43.393
She is not.

871
00:53:43.428 --> 00:53:44.691
That is all we know
at this junction.

872
00:53:44.726 --> 00:53:47.430
That. and she bumped
into your trusted handyman

873
00:53:47.465 --> 00:53:48.761
at the gas station.

874
00:53:48.796 --> 00:53:50.334
Technically. there's no crime.

875
00:54:46.953 --> 00:54:47.754
FRANK'-
Hey!

876
00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:50.955
You lookin' to get shot?

877
00:54:53.124 --> 00:54:55.091
No.

878
00:54:55.126 --> 00:54:56.598
Then why the fuck
you touchin' it?

879
00:54:59.064 --> 00:55:01.636
I don't know--
I just uh. thought--

880
00:55:01.671 --> 00:55:02.802
I don't know.

881
00:55:02.837 --> 00:55:03.869
What are you doin' here?

882
00:55:05.576 --> 00:55:08.940
FRANK'-
I'm lookin' for uh.
lookin' for Frank.

883
00:55:08.975 --> 00:55:10.513
Frank?

884
00:55:10.548 --> 00:55:11.613
Yeah. Frank.

885
00:55:11.648 --> 00:55:13.648
FRANK'-
Who sent you?

886
00:55:13.683 --> 00:55:15.782
Frank's a friend of mine.
I know him from Knuckles.

887
00:55:15.817 --> 00:55:17.916
Knuckles.

888
00:55:17.951 --> 00:55:19.390
How do you Knuckles?

889
00:55:19.425 --> 00:55:20.820
Does it fuckin' matter?

890
00:55:20.855 --> 00:55:22.624
I'm askin' a question.
Yeah. it fuckin' matters.

891
00:55:22.659 --> 00:55:25.154
Well. he's a friend of mine.
He works for my family.

892
00:55:25.189 --> 00:55:26.021
He introduced me to Frank.

893
00:55:26.057 --> 00:55:29.026
I'm here to do some business
with him.

894
00:55:29.061 --> 00:55:30.698
All right?

895
00:55:30.733 --> 00:55:32.469
Where you coming from?

896
00:55:33.868 --> 00:55:36.440
Coming from Emerson.

897
00:55:36.475 --> 00:55:37.573
Fuck you.

898
00:55:41.172 --> 00:55:42.512
Where's your car?

899
00:55:43.713 --> 00:55:44.811
Dude. it's crazy.

900
00:55:44.846 --> 00:55:46.879
My car broke down
like a couple of miles

901
00:55:46.914 --> 00:55:49.717
back down the road.
so I'm fuckin' late.

902
00:55:49.752 --> 00:55:50.518
You walkin' through those woods?

903
00:55:50.553 --> 00:55:51.620
Yeah. I'm walkin'
through the woods

904
00:55:51.655 --> 00:55:52.786
and Frank's waitin' for me.

905
00:55:52.821 --> 00:55:55.855
So. you wanna
let me get on my way?

906
00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:57.186
Frank didn't tell me anyone's
comin' this way.

907
00:55:57.221 --> 00:55:58.759
Well.
'cause Frank didn't fuckin' know

908
00:55:58.794 --> 00:55:59.958
I'd be runnin'
through the fuckin' woods.

909
00:55:59.993 --> 00:56:01.564
I'm supposed to be
drivin' there.

910
00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.029
Calm down. give me a second.

911
00:56:06.868 --> 00:56:07.801
Hey. Frank.

912
00:56:12.643 --> 00:56:13.708
FRANK'-
Frank. you copy?

913
00:56:18.176 --> 00:56:19.615
FRANK'-
You say your car broke down?

914
00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:22.178
Yeah. a couple of miles of back.

915
00:56:22.213 --> 00:56:23.146
Gave me a workout.

916
00:56:23.181 --> 00:56:25.555
Yeah. no fucking kidding.

917
00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:27.216
Frank. you copy?

918
00:56:27.251 --> 00:56:28.657
-You know what?

919
00:56:28.692 --> 00:56:31.594
Can we stop
fuckin' wasting time. eh?

920
00:56:31.629 --> 00:56:33.024
-You want--
-Hey.

921
00:56:33.059 --> 00:56:35.730
I'm just doin' my fucking job.

922
00:56:35.765 --> 00:56:37.666
Fuck's sake. man.

923
00:56:37.701 --> 00:56:39.833
You know what? I'll fuckin' go.

924
00:56:39.868 --> 00:56:41.472
The phone
not gonna work out here.

925
00:56:42.673 --> 00:56:44.134
Oh. fuck. I can't believe it.

926
00:56:44.169 --> 00:56:45.201
You don't think I would have
fuckin' called him?

927
00:56:45.236 --> 00:56:46.939
You know what?
Enough of this shit.

928
00:56:46.974 --> 00:56:48.479
How about the worst fucking day?

929
00:56:48.514 --> 00:56:51.207
Fucking car's broken down.
now you're stoppin' me.

930
00:56:51.242 --> 00:56:53.011
Why don't you explain to Frank
why this didn't happen.

931
00:56:53.046 --> 00:56:54.485
all right?

932
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.585
Can't wait to see
what happens there.

933
00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:56.784
I'm fuckin' out.

934
00:57:00.955 --> 00:57:03.087
All right. hold the fuck up!

935
00:57:07.258 --> 00:57:08.928
Keep walkin' down that way.

936
00:57:08.963 --> 00:57:11.700
All right. Thanks.

937
00:57:14.606 --> 00:57:15.902
You better not be fuckin' me.

938
00:57:28.147 --> 00:57:30.015
Fuck you. motherfucker!

939
00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:31.984
-Uh. no.
-- Cool down. hey!

940
00:57:32.019 --> 00:57:32.820
-- No.
-- Fuck you. man.

941
00:57:32.855 --> 00:57:33.689
Get out of here.

942
00:57:33.724 --> 00:57:35.592
Oh. oh.

943
00:58:42.023 --> 00:58:43.660
Leave this.

944
00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:17.727
Is the truck fixed yet?

945
00:59:17.762 --> 00:59:18.926
Yeah. man. the truck's all good.

946
00:59:22.096 --> 00:59:23.667
Larry Barry.

947
00:59:23.702 --> 00:59:25.867
Hey. yo. get back to work.

948
00:59:25.902 --> 00:59:27.198
This is the second time
I asked you. man.

949
00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.336
Fuck.

950
00:59:33.371 --> 00:59:36.042
And so he just ran off
into the woods?

951
00:59:36.077 --> 00:59:38.308
<i>Yes. but we're in the process</i>
<i>of setting up a perimeter.</i>

952
00:59:38.343 --> 00:59:39.144
All right. thank you.

953
00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:45.755
Sergeant!

954
01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.021
What the--

955
01:01:54.149 --> 01:01:55.181
Come. Oscar.

956
01:01:58.483 --> 01:01:59.922
Hey!

957
01:02:04.863 --> 01:02:06.060
Yo. Oscar.

958
01:02:13.267 --> 01:02:14.530
Fuck.

959
01:02:45.497 --> 01:02:46.562
-- ...right back.

960
01:02:46.597 --> 01:02:47.497
All right. I'll be right back.

961
01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.341
Hey. clean this shit up.

962
01:02:56.376 --> 01:02:58.244
All right. Yeah. yeah.
I'm comin'. I'm comin'. I'm--

963
01:04:09.053 --> 01:04:09.920
Get in it.

964
01:05:01.666 --> 01:05:03.303
Hey. man.
I told Robert about that.

965
01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:17.053
-Give me a minute with him.
-Mmhmm.

966
01:05:24.458 --> 01:05:27.261
Pete Daniels.

967
01:05:27.296 --> 01:05:28.295
That's your real name?

968
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:34.565
-Unemployed?
-Fuck you. man.

969
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.501
I fuckin' worked. Just--

970
01:05:36.536 --> 01:05:37.469
Recently?

971
01:05:37.504 --> 01:05:41.011
Yeah. I fuckin' worked recently.

972
01:05:41.046 --> 01:05:41.737
Where?

973
01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:43.541
Wherever fuckin' pays me. man.

974
01:05:43.576 --> 01:05:46.577
Uh. you know. put up a fence.
pull a fuckin' post. demo work.

975
01:05:46.612 --> 01:05:50.746
And sometimes you kidnap women
and hold 'em for ransom. right?

976
01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:52.088
Why are you fuckin'--

977
01:05:52.123 --> 01:05:53.716
Why are you grilling me
like this man?

978
01:05:53.751 --> 01:05:55.487
I'm the one that got attacked.
and tied up.

979
01:05:55.522 --> 01:05:57.357
and thrown in a fucking car!

980
01:05:57.392 --> 01:05:59.128
Why am I the fuckin' bad guy?

981
01:06:28.555 --> 01:06:30.291
Here's what I'm gonna do
for you.

982
01:06:31.093 --> 01:06:33.558
You tell me where Lisa is
and I'll walk in the court

983
01:06:33.593 --> 01:06:36.792
and I'll tell them
how cooperative you've been.

984
01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:39.300
I'll sing your praises
to the rooftops.

985
01:06:39.769 --> 01:06:42.138
And I bet
if Will gets his wife back

986
01:06:42.173 --> 01:06:43.337
and the Adams
get their daughter back.

987
01:06:43.372 --> 01:06:45.405
I can convince them
not to press charges.

988
01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.308
Fuck you. man.
I ain't no stupid.

989
01:06:47.343 --> 01:06:49.178
I know
you can't promise me shit.

990
01:06:49.213 --> 01:06:50.575
I'm just telling you
what I may be able to do

991
01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:51.708
to help you out.

992
01:07:19.903 --> 01:07:21.474
How did you get her
into your car?

993
01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:26.116
Who said I fuckin' did. huh?

994
01:07:26.151 --> 01:07:27.183
You didn't?

995
01:07:33.257 --> 01:07:34.355
I don't recall.

996
01:07:35.124 --> 01:07:38.194
You're on footage
talking to Lisa.

997
01:07:38.229 --> 01:07:39.327
but you forgot.

998
01:07:39.796 --> 01:07:41.494
Hey. uh. excuse me.

999
01:07:41.529 --> 01:07:43.232
Lisa. Lisa Adams!

1000
01:07:44.499 --> 01:07:46.466
-Pete. hi.
-Knuckles.

1001
01:07:46.501 --> 01:07:48.600
-Right. hi. how are you?
-I'm good. How're you?

1002
01:07:48.635 --> 01:07:50.404

01:07:50.439 --> 01:07:52.208
-Yeah. Yeah. that's--

1005
01:07:55.642 --> 01:07:57.609
your parents' house on the room.

1006
01:07:57.644 --> 01:07:59.281
-Oh. that's you! Okay.
-- Yeah. yeah.

1007
01:07:59.316 --> 01:08:00.447
-They're so happy with it.
-- Oh yeah.

1008
01:08:00.482 --> 01:08:01.548
-I can't wait to see it.
-Good.

1009
01:08:01.583 --> 01:08:03.450
Are you-- are you--
are you headin' there right now?

1010
01:08:03.485 --> 01:08:04.484
-- Yeah. Yeah.
-Are you?

1011
01:08:04.519 --> 01:08:05.683
Could you do me a favor?

1012
01:08:05.718 --> 01:08:07.619
Could you uh. bring an invoice
that I got?

1013
01:08:07.654 --> 01:08:09.390
Sure.

1014
01:08:09.425 --> 01:08:09.957
Just a little something.
drop off for your pops.

1015
01:08:09.992 --> 01:08:10.925
-Okay.
-Real quick.

1016
01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.394
-- Yeah. no problem.
-Who you here with?

1017
01:08:13.429 --> 01:08:14.593
-- Oh. my husband.
-Oh.

1018
01:08:14.628 --> 01:08:15.427
Yeah.

1019
01:08:15.462 --> 01:08:16.760
You look really great.
by the way.

1020
01:08:16.795 --> 01:08:17.627
-Thanks. thanks.
-Yeah.

1021
01:08:17.663 --> 01:08:19.499
You have to tell your mom
I said "hi."

1022
01:08:19.534 --> 01:08:21.237
I haven't seen her for uh--
Shut the fuck up.

1023
01:08:21.272 --> 01:08:22.832
-Get in the fuckin' car.

1024
01:08:22.867 --> 01:08:25.736
Don't be stupid. just get in.
Get in the fuckin' car.

1025
01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.679
You're on tape
talking to her

1026
01:08:34.714 --> 01:08:35.911
right before she disappeared

1027
01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:37.682
and no one's seen her alive
since.

1028
01:08:37.717 --> 01:08:39.321
Yeah.
so I fuckin' talked to her. man.

1029
01:08:39.356 --> 01:08:41.653
Big fuckin' deal. all right?
I knew her.

1030
01:08:41.688 --> 01:08:43.358
I was workin'
at her fuckin' parents' house.

1031
01:09:25.996 --> 01:09:28.238
-You just keep an eye on him.
-Damn. man.

1032
01:09:28.273 --> 01:09:30.240
Close to maybe two days.
I gotta fix the shit.

1033
01:10:05.805 --> 01:10:07.607
I think it's inside the kitchen.

1034
01:10:07.642 --> 01:10:10.038
Inside. You got the key?

1035
01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:11.006
I don't have the key. man.

1036
01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:13.415
-- Shit.

1037
01:10:14.518 --> 01:10:15.714
Okay. I'll go back to the house
and get the key.

1038
01:10:15.749 --> 01:10:17.551
-Whoa. whoa.
-Oh. shit.

1040
01:10:18.454 --> 01:10:20.422
-Watch your hands.

01:10:31.703 --> 01:10:32.863
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about.

1048
01:10:32.898 --> 01:10:35.030
Calm down. man. Be easy.

01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:44.512
I just wanna know where she is
and I will get out of here.

1052
01:10:44.547 --> 01:10:45.777
No police. no nothing.

So. please tell me.

1063
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.339
I will shoot you

1064
01:11:09.374 --> 01:11:10.439

01:11:11.541 --> 01:11:12.672

Can you please
just understand this?

1092
01:16:12.072 --> 01:16:13.676
I don't wanna be like this
I don't wanna resent you

1093
01:16:13.711 --> 01:16:15.205
and I don't want you
to resent me.

1094
01:16:16.813 --> 01:16:18.780
-You're my best friend.
-- Oh.

1095
01:16:18.815 --> 01:16:20.342
You're my favorite human.

1096
01:16:20.377 --> 01:16:22.047

You must be
the dumbest motherfucker alive.

1103
01:16:51.313 --> 01:16:53.309
You kidnapped a woman
in broad daylight

1104
01:16:53.344 --> 01:16:55.146
and think nobody saw that shit?

1105
01:16:55.181 --> 01:16:58.116
You're doin' life!
You're doin' life.

1106
01:16:59.218 --> 01:17:00.250

1111
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:16.332
-Where is she?
-She's fuckin' dead. man.

1112
01:17:24.177 --> 01:17:26.881
She's fuckin' dead.

1113
01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:37.023
You killed her?

1114
01:17:40.996 --> 01:17:41.764
Hey.

1115
01:17:43.229 --> 01:17:44.866

1116
01:17:47.035 --> 01:17:48.100
Fuck.

1117
01:17:53.041 --> 01:17:54.843
I'm right in knowin'
I'd see you here.

1118
01:17:56.044 --> 01:17:57.846
Yeah. everybody
does a little meth. right?

1119
01:17:58.582 --> 01:18:00.178
I mean
that's easy fuckin' money.

1120
01:18:01.313 --> 01:18:03.247
All right.
what about kidnappin'. huh?

1121
01:18:03.282 --> 01:18:05.920
-Is that good money?
-Fuck that.

1122
01:18:05.955 --> 01:18:08.824
-I didn't kidnap anybody.
-You're so full of shit.

1123
01:18:12.225 --> 01:18:13.422
You're not fuckin' kill me?
What are you gonna do?

1124
01:18:13.457 --> 01:18:15.831
You're gonna fuckin' kill me.

1125
01:18:15.866 --> 01:18:17.228
You might wanna ask Frank that.

1126
01:18:18.429 --> 01:18:19.329
Eh?

1127
01:18:19.731 --> 01:18:21.331
You're not a fucking killer
either.

1128
01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:26.072
All right. put the gun down.
Lower it.

1129
01:18:26.107 --> 01:18:29.339
You put the fucking gun down!
You put it down!

01:18:32.575 --> 01:18:33.849
All right.

1131
01:18:39.219 --> 01:18:40.482
Okay. talk to me.

1132
01:18:41.318 --> 01:18:43.925
I think it's fucking crazy
you care so much about your wife

1133
01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.158
when she's gettin' ready
to leave your ass.

1134
01:18:46.193 --> 01:18:48.127
I mean. but that's divorce
for you. though. right?

1135
01:18:48.162 --> 01:18:49.425
It's like gettin' fucked twice.

1136
01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.559
How you know
about the divorce. huh?

1137
01:18:51.594 --> 01:18:53.396
if you're not involved
in the kidnappin'?

1138
01:18:53.431 --> 01:18:56.806
Knuckles. Yeah. Knuckles.

1139
01:18:56.841 --> 01:18:58.038
Listen.
that's not the fucking point.

1140
01:18:58.073 --> 01:19:00.843
The point is that I know
where the fuck she is.

1141
01:19:00.878 --> 01:19:03.439
All right. where is she?
Tell me where she is!

1142
01:19:05.014 --> 01:19:06.079
She alive?

1143
01:19:07.181 --> 01:19:09.049
-Is she alive?
-20.000.

1144
01:19:11.053 --> 01:19:13.020
Okay. 20.000

1145
01:19:13.055 --> 01:19:14.483
-You're a lying piece of shit.
-Everything you need to know.

1146
01:19:14.518 --> 01:19:16.155
I don't believe you!

1147
01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:17.860
Tell me where she is.

Hey. prove it!

1149
01:19:23.296 --> 01:19:24.097
Huh?

01:19:25.562 --> 01:19:27.265
It's her fuckin' phone. right?

1151
01:19:31.975 --> 01:19:33.942
Right. that's her phone. right?
That's her phone. right?

1152
01:19:36.111 --> 01:19:37.143

1153
01:19:37.178 --> 01:19:38.309

1156
01:19:41.017 --> 01:19:42.852
-Yeah. now we're talkin'.
-You think I didn't see her?

1157
01:19:42.887 --> 01:19:44.513
I saw her when she bought
that bottle of water.

1158
01:19:44.548 --> 01:19:46.218
Yeah. I saw her.

1159
01:19:47.551 --> 01:19:50.189
Come on.
$20.000 and I will tell you.

1160
01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:52.422
Huh?

1161
01:19:54.558 --> 01:20:00.100
All right. I'll give you 20.000.
Oh. my ball's in your court.

1162
01:20:00.135 --> 01:20:02.036
-I'll give you the money.
-Okay.

1163
01:20:03.369 --> 01:20:05.501
Okay.

1164
01:20:05.536 --> 01:20:06.469
-How am I gonna get the money?
-I'm gonna go--

1165
01:20:07.912 --> 01:20:09.637

1168
01:20:12.576 --> 01:20:14.917
-I wanna see her.
-I'm coming with you.

1169
01:20:14.952 --> 01:20:16.919
-I'm coming with you!
-You're not comin' with me!

1170
01:20:16.954 --> 01:20:18.481
I'm coming with you! I think
you're gonna call the cops!

1171
01:20:18.516 --> 01:20:20.087
Let me see her!
Let me see my fuckin' wife!

1172
01:20:50.988 --> 01:20:52.251
And how do you know she's dead?

1173
01:20:53.386 --> 01:20:55.254
How do you know she's dead?

1174
01:20:55.689 --> 01:20:58.554
-How do you know she's dead?
-Because I dug the fucking hole!

1175
01:21:03.693 --> 01:21:06.001
A couple of weeks ago. I was--

1176
01:21:06.036 --> 01:21:08.333
I was just talking shit
with Frank.

1177
01:21:08.368 --> 01:21:10.533
I was just fuckin' around
about how this--

1178
01:21:10.568 --> 01:21:13.437
This fuckin' girl I knew
was coming back.

1179
01:21:13.472 --> 01:21:15.439
She married
this fuckin' rich dude

1180
01:21:15.474 --> 01:21:17.309
and we could get a shit ton
of money

1181
01:21:17.344 --> 01:21:18.574
if we snatched her. you know?

1182
01:21:18.609 --> 01:21:20.609
He'd wanna get her back.
you know?

1183
01:21:24.186 --> 01:21:26.087
I wasn't fuckin'
thinkin' straight.

1184
01:21:27.123 --> 01:21:28.287
It was fuckin' stupid. man.

1185
01:21:28.322 --> 01:21:29.651
I saw her
at the fucking gas station.

1186
01:21:29.686 --> 01:21:31.653
I just fuckin' snatched her.

1187
01:21:31.688 --> 01:21:33.226
And then I--
I took her to Frank.

1188
01:21:33.261 --> 01:21:37.329
I took her to Frank.
He got so fuckin' mad. man.

1189
01:21:37.364 --> 01:21:40.200
He was so fuckin' pissed off
that I took her there.

1190
01:21:40.235 --> 01:21:42.433
'cause he knew-- he knew
there were fuckin' cameras.

1191
01:21:42.468 --> 01:21:44.534
That they fuckin' saw me.

1192
01:21:44.569 --> 01:21:47.141
And Frank wouldn't let me leave
with her alive.

1193
01:21:49.244 --> 01:21:51.079
He said
I had to dig a fucking hole

1194
01:21:51.114 --> 01:21:52.344
and put her in it.

1195
01:21:53.743 --> 01:21:55.743
I was diggin' the hole.

1196
01:21:55.778 --> 01:21:57.987
but I knew Frank
was gonna put me in it. too.

1197
01:21:58.022 --> 01:22:00.550
so I fuckin' ran.

1198
01:22:00.585 --> 01:22:02.992
I didn't wanna hurt her.

1199
01:22:03.027 --> 01:22:04.191
Where's the hole?

1200
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:08.756
-Where is the fucking hole?
-At Frank's house.

1201
01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:09.999
Up in Beckley.

1202
01:22:11.662 --> 01:22:14.366
I swear to God.
I just wanted the fuckin' money.

1203
01:22:25.214 --> 01:22:27.049
Jesus. fucking.

1204
01:22:48.303 --> 01:22:50.039
Hey. turn that off.

1205
01:23:13.757 --> 01:23:15.361
Drivin' in circles. huh?

1206
01:23:19.169 --> 01:23:20.597
We found Knuckles in your trunk.

1207
01:23:25.802 --> 01:23:27.175
I'm under arrest?

1208
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:30.706
Stay put.

1209
01:24:58.565 --> 01:24:59.333
Hmm.

1210
01:25:14.614 --> 01:25:17.582
Lisa? Lisa!

1211
01:25:18.948 --> 01:25:21.190
-Lisa?

1212
01:25:21.225 --> 01:25:23.390
-What the fuck.

1213
01:25:23.425 --> 01:25:26.228
-Okay. I'm comin'.

1214
01:25:31.367 --> 01:25:34.302
Lisa. Oh shit. baby.

1215
01:25:42.279 --> 01:25:43.905
What the fuck? It's okay.

1216
01:25:44.941 --> 01:25:46.512
-It's okay.

1217
01:25:46.547 --> 01:25:47.942
Oh. it's okay. baby.

1218
01:25:50.012 --> 01:25:51.616
I got you.

1219
01:25:53.752 --> 01:25:56.225
-It's okay.

1220
01:25:58.295 --> 01:25:59.459
You're okay. see.

1221
01:26:01.595 --> 01:26:03.628
-It's okay. it's okay.

1222
01:26:03.663 --> 01:26:07.401
Will. please.
get me out of here please.

1223
01:26:09.405 --> 01:26:10.668
Okay. come.

1224
01:26:24.288 --> 01:26:26.915
-I got you.
-- Okay.

1225
01:27:11.599 --> 01:27:13.467
As I figured.
couldn't stand the guilt.

1226
01:27:14.899 --> 01:27:17.064
Knuckles signed the confession.

1227
01:27:17.099 --> 01:27:19.737
but he still blames everything
on Frank. by the way.

1228
01:27:19.772 --> 01:27:21.772
But who the fuck knows?

1229
01:27:21.807 --> 01:27:23.411
I think
Oscar caught him in the act

1230
01:27:23.446 --> 01:27:25.644
and tried to push himself
into the ransom money.

1231
01:27:27.351 --> 01:27:28.416
Wow.

1232
01:27:29.352 --> 01:27:31.485
Look at some real salts
of the earth there. huh?

1233
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.421
One could say that.

1234
01:27:35.656 --> 01:27:37.359
By the way uh.

1235
01:27:37.394 --> 01:27:39.658
we inspected
some of the remains.

1236
01:27:39.693 --> 01:27:41.088
Not all of them died
in the explosions.

1237
01:27:41.123 --> 01:27:42.859
there were some shots exchanged.

1238
01:27:49.373 --> 01:27:53.903
I said to myself.
"Hey. you lived by the sword."

1239
01:28:03.046 --> 01:28:05.552
-Thank you.
-Take care of yourself.

1240
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:30.577
Can you um. give us a minute?

1241
01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.115
-Hi.
-- Hey.

1242
01:28:49.829 --> 01:28:51.466
-Good?
-Yeah.

1243
01:28:53.701 --> 01:28:54.931
Come with me.

1244
01:28:58.871 --> 01:29:01.443
-Yeah.
