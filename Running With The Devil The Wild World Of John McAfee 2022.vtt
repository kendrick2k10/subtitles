They came from Belize
and I think they have the stamp from…

4
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.160
If they came from Punta Gorda.
they should've had a stamp.

5
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.520
What can we do?

6
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.640
-Why don't I take care of this?
-They came from the International Airport.

7
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.920
-Did he?
-Milk?

8
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.360
Thanks.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.640
-He's the man who created the antivirus.
-Okay. Okay.

10
00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.160
That man wants to film me as well…

11
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.440
He is persecuted politically
by the Belizean authorities.

12
00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.720
They've initiated
a political persecution against him

13
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.280
and he has had to
safeguard his integrity and life

14
00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.840
by crossing the border
of Guatemala to seek asylum.

15
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.440
-What is your evidence?
-Documents.

16
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.240
-Threats from the Belizean government?
-Yes.

17
00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:53.199
Yes. my uncle has his passport.

18
00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:56.440
-If he has it. there's no problem. right?
-No.

19
00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.040
Due to his illegal status in the country.

20
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.400
He's American
how are you going to take him with you?

21
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.760
-We don't mess with Federales.
-Yeah. From the federal district. Okay.

22
00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.240
…but right now is not the moment.

23
00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.000
Look. we're just following orders
from our superiors.

24
00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:08.920
I know.

25
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
The thing is. as I'm telling you.
this situation we have…

26
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.640
I need to work on the patient!
