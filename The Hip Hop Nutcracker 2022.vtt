6
00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:27.902
{\an8}<i>Mom and Pop just can't seem to get along.</i>
<i>And Maria-Clara wishes they'd work it out</i>

7

18
00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.736
{\an8}<i>Back in the day</i>
<i>Where Hip-Hop was pumping</i>

19

<i>But they're bringing her down</i>

24
00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.125
{\an8}<i>Whatever happened</i>
<i>To that night in the club</i>

25
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.419
{\an8}<i>When they first saw each other</i>
<i>And they fell in love?</i>
