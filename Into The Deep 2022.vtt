Huh? Hey. Why?

178
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.720
I said I've got to go.
My friend's here. Just stay.

Tom. Come on. wait a minute.
Tom! Come on. Just... Let go.

Just stay a bit. Tom. let go.

181
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.560
Off you go. then.

Hey. you came!
Hey. you OK?

183
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.840
Hey. mate. Yeah. it's
nothing I can't handle.

184

Who's this? He's my friend.
Let's go.

TOM: Where you going?
So she told you to leave her. man.

Oh. yeah...

BEN: Yeah.

191
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.800
Shit. I'm so sorry. It's not
your fault that he's an asshole.

192
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.160
Yeah. but I...invited you here.

193
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.760
That was a really warm welcome.

194
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.880
What's his problem anyway?

195
00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.600
It's just those guys don't
take out-of-towners very well.

196
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.920
Yeah. well. he made his point.
I'm gonna leave you guys to it.

(WHISPERS) Don't let
this one get away!

198
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.440
For the pain?

199
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.040
Thank you.

200
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.200
Do you want to get out of here?

201
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.000
Yeah. yeah. Please.

Fun neighbours? Yeah.

208
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.800
Yeah. they've been
partying since I got here.

This is kind of amazing.
Yeah. it's not bad.

Welcome to my home.

It's...actually pretty nice.

Hey. don't sound so surprised.

224
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.880
Yeah. I'm not much of
a photographer. I know.

225
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.120
I'm impressed.

226
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.040
So. are you gonna offer me another
drink or... Oh. right. yeah!

227
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.720
Do you want more vodka?
I could make you a gin and tonic?

228

the boat is at all times.

Now. let me see if I have
something for that. Hold on.

Oh. I guess I've always just
been obsessed with the ocean.

Yeah.

of our little town?

Yeah. I've lived here my whole life.

as soon as I can.

been away from home?

265

Oh. about two years.
That's a long time!

lost it after my dad died.

268
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.080
I couldn't be responsible
for her any more.

I haven't looked back since.

was meant to be a nice thing.

we were out here.

to sea whilst you were asleep?

like that. you know.

and everything.

good news is. we still have beer.

501

What does that mean?
Well. we can still sail.

502

We're just gonna have to
wait until the wind picks up.

503

a problem with it overheating.

just raise the sails up?

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.440
And as soon as the wind comes back.
we'll be on our way in. OK?

some kind of way

to call the coast guard
or something?

of anyone contacting us at all?
It's kind of great. right?

really get to be unreachable?

just make the most of it.

I was just worried.

521
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.920
Ah. you're really
cute when you worry.

522
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.960
OK. more shots!

OK. so explain this little
bond you guys have got going on.

529
00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.600
I want to hear all the details.

530

We're both members
of the dead parents club.

Oh. I'm... I'm really
sorry to hear that.

533

Mum or dad?
Dad. Mum.

534
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.480
How long ago?

535
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.920
About two years.

536
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.760
How did he die?
Heart attack.

537
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.200
I thought it was cancer.

538
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.360
Yeah. it was.

539
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.920
He had a heart attack when
he was going through chemo.

540
00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.480
His body just kind of broke down.

541
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.600
Sounds kind of like
a blessing in disguise.

542
00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.280
Yeah.

543
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.160
Well. we really lowered
the tone. didn't we?

544
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.560
(LAUGHS) Yeah. fuck that.
Uh. let's play a game.

545
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.600
I love a game.
Hm. bet you do.

546
00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.320
Do you have a coin?
Oh. yeah.

547
00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.000
OK. game on.

548
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.640

550
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.400
I flip the coin.

551

If you're right.
you're in the clear.

552
00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.680
But if you're wrong.
you either have to

553
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.800
take a sip of your drink or
take off an item of clothing.

554
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.520
Who gets to decide?
The other two of us. I guess?

555
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.000
All right. Yeah?
Yeah. OK. Flip it.

556
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.520

557
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.760
Jess?

558
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.800

559
00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.520

560
00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.840
Correct.

561
00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.120

Yes. you obviously are.

570
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.880

up a little bit?

576
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.960
OK. how so?
Instead of just sip and strip. kiss.

or something. before he wakes up.

Why were you looking
at the engines anyway?

620

Because I didn't
trust they were broken.
