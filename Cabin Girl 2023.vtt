it's not getting easier.

14
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:46.036
so I've decided it's time
I take control of my life.

15
00:00:46.036 --> 00:00:50.267
I used up all the money I had
and I bought a van. a Westy.

16
00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:54.408

(Ava screams)

69
00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:51.767
Hey. guys. I know I've been
MIA the last couple months.

70
00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:54.828
and you guys have no idea
how much I've missed you.

71
00:03:54.828 --> 00:03:57.108
I know you've been worried
and leaving comments.

72
00:03:57.108 --> 00:03:59.028
but I'm back.

73
00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:00.409
You know how I've always wanted to

74
00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:01.879
buy a little cabin in the woods?

75
00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.009
Well. I actually did it.

76
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.560
I pulled the trigger and
bought this little place.

77
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.450
I really believe in listening to

78
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.010
the signs from the universe.

79
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.381
and some signs are more
convincing than others.

80
00:04:12.381 --> 00:04:14.391
I had a little fender bender.

81
00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:16.851
Let's say the deer got
away to live another day.

82
00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:20.842
My van. not so much.
neither did my forehead.

83
00:04:20.842 --> 00:04:24.773
and here comes my new fairy godmother.

84
00:04:24.773 --> 00:04:27.143
What do you have to tell
the good people. Dottie?

85
00:04:27.143 --> 00:04:29.468
She's all yours.

86
00:04:29.468 --> 00:04:32.394
Thank you so much for everything.

87
00:04:32.394 --> 00:04:34.374

88
00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:37.708
And here comes my knight
in shining skinny jeans.

(truck horn beeps)

90
00:04:40.885 --> 00:04:43.436
Kellen found my ass broken
down on the side of the road

91
00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:45.266
after I hit that deer.

92
00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:47.817
He's been amazing these
last couple of months.

This is the bedroom. It's quaint.

101
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.801

stuff this place came with.

Hey.

107
00:05:30.424 --> 00:05:32.684
I put the van in the shed.

Hey. van lifers. It's Jackie.

188
00:10:37.405 --> 00:10:39.895
I just wanted to come on
here and introduce myself.

189
00:10:39.895 --> 00:10:43.496
I'm brand new. so any tips
and tricks are welcome.

190
00:10:43.496 --> 00:10:47.066
and. Ava Robbins. if you
happen to be watching this.

191
00:10:47.066 --> 00:10:48.177
I'm your biggest fan!

192
00:10:48.177 --> 00:10:49.115
Hey. guys.

193
00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:52.617
Good news and a little
bit of disappointing news.

194
00:10:52.617 --> 00:10:56.728
Ava is back. but it seems
like she is ditching van life.

195
00:10:56.728 --> 00:10:59.786
like many other people in the
van life community right now.

196
00:10:59.786 --> 00:11:03.539
and I didn't expect her
to go that route. so.

197
00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:06.150
I just really fell
in love with this place

198
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.737
while I was recovering.

199
00:11:07.737 --> 00:11:11.554
and. I don't know. it's just
like living in simpler times.

200
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:14.011
Lookie here.

201
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:16.803
Hey. stranger. How's cabin life?

202
00:11:16.803 --> 00:11:19.265
Rustic. How's engine life?

203
00:11:20.612 --> 00:11:22.172
It's rusty.

204
00:11:22.172 --> 00:11:24.243
It looks pretty good from over here.

205
00:11:24.243 --> 00:11:27.230
and my ladies out there. he's single.

206
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.353

207
00:11:28.353 --> 00:11:29.313
Hey. now.

208
00:11:29.313 --> 00:11:32.224
Don't forget about me.
Uncle Dave is single too.

209
00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:33.593
Hey. I'll put the word out.

(Dave chuckles)

211
00:11:34.426 --> 00:11:37.475
All right. I'm gonna leave
you and your dimples alone

212
00:11:37.475 --> 00:11:39.485
and go hike on my lonesome.

213
00:11:39.485 --> 00:11:40.529
Text me later?

214
00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:43.785

Oh. oh!

216
00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:45.966
Oh. geez.
Oh!

217
00:11:45.966 --> 00:11:48.727
I'm so sorry.
No. it's okay. Ava.

218
00:11:48.727 --> 00:11:50.107

219

221
00:11:54.668 --> 00:11:56.708
Well. I forgot your name.

222
00:11:56.708 --> 00:11:59.348

Well. guys. it's been a long day.

244
00:13:31.944 --> 00:13:33.774
I think it's time to head
back to the cabin. huh?

245
00:13:33.774 --> 00:13:34.818
Ava.

246
00:13:34.818 --> 00:13:36.235

(eerie music continues)

255
00:14:29.866 --> 00:14:31.616
Do you guys see that?

256
00:14:33.523 --> 00:14:34.606
What is that?

257
00:14:36.523 --> 00:14:39.098
(engine roars)

258
00:14:39.098 --> 00:14:40.221
(Ava screams)

259
00:14:40.221 --> 00:14:42.067
(tires squeal)

260
00:14:42.067 --> 00:14:44.567

261

(eerie music continues)

262
00:14:54.241 --> 00:14:57.218
What do you guys think happened to her?

263
00:14:57.218 --> 00:14:58.268
She jumped.

264
00:14:59.259 --> 00:15:00.759
Oh. you scared me.

265
00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:02.439
She tied a cinder block around her waist

266
00:15:02.439 --> 00:15:03.972
and she dove in headfirst.

267
00:15:04.899 --> 00:15:06.463
God. Why?

268
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.367
Wanted to make it stick. I guess.

269
00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:12.951
(somber music)

270
00:15:16.211 --> 00:15:17.472
Ava.

271
00:15:17.472 --> 00:15:21.037
Trina. I'm guessing
you're the internet girl.

272
00:15:21.037 --> 00:15:23.413
Wow. Word travels fast around here.

273
00:15:23.413 --> 00:15:25.573
I mean. it is a small town.

274
00:15:25.573 --> 00:15:28.423
There are no secrets. Just gossip.

275
00:15:28.423 --> 00:15:30.074
Thanks for the heads up.

276
00:15:30.074 --> 00:15:32.204
Well. I own the best bar in town.

277
00:15:32.204 --> 00:15:34.904
It is the only bar. the Mystic Fox.

278
00:15:34.904 --> 00:15:37.580
You should pop in sometime for a drink.

279
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.717
(Ava screams)

280
00:15:40.717 --> 00:15:41.956
Hey. are you okay?

281
00:15:41.956 --> 00:15:45.769
Yeah. yeah. I just need to sit down.

282
00:15:47.982 --> 00:15:50.061
(idyllic country music)

283
00:15:50.061 --> 00:15:54.168
(country singer indistinctly singing)

284
00:15:54.168 --> 00:15:57.468
Just take it easy.
The internet can wait.

285
00:15:57.468 --> 00:16:00.723
It can't. My subscribers
are everything to me.

286
00:16:00.723 --> 00:16:02.608
I can't let 'em down.

287
00:16:02.608 --> 00:16:05.300
That sounds fulfilling.

288
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.050
I'm lucky. I didn't have
much going on before this.

289
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.800
Now I have a real sense of purpose.

290
00:16:12.158 --> 00:16:13.741
Thanks for the ride.

291
00:16:13.741 --> 00:16:17.242
(country singer indistinctly singing)

292
00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:18.075
Oh. shit.

293
00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:22.582
(solemn music)

294
00:16:22.582 --> 00:16:23.416
What?

295
00:16:23.416 --> 00:16:26.423
I didn't know this place was for sale.

296
00:16:26.423 --> 00:16:27.473
Why wouldn't it be?

297
00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:32.574
This is where Hannah
Granger used to live.

298
00:16:32.574 --> 00:16:34.024
What are the chances of that?

299
00:16:35.124 --> 00:16:37.795
Hey. guys. so. you know.
I went on a hike today.

300
00:16:37.795 --> 00:16:40.673
tried to explore my new grounds.

301
00:16:40.673 --> 00:16:45.674
and I came across this
really haunting memorial

302
00:16:45.929 --> 00:16:49.287
that had been defaced.

303
00:16:49.287 --> 00:16:50.247
Turns out it belongs to

304
00:16:50.247 --> 00:16:52.287
this young woman named Hannah Granger.

305
00:16:52.287 --> 00:16:55.558
who actually jumped to her
death on this bridge right here.

306
00:16:55.558 --> 00:16:57.538
I just can't imagine

307
00:16:57.538 --> 00:16:59.999
the amount of pain you
need to be in to do that.

308
00:16:59.999 --> 00:17:02.189
and so I wish her peace
and love wherever she is.

309
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:05.460
You know I don't believe in coincidences.

310
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.000
but. at the time of her death.
she was living in my cabin.

311
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.881
I don't know if it's a sign or an omen.

312
00:17:11.881 --> 00:17:14.281
but I'm really glad you guys are here

313
00:17:14.281 --> 00:17:16.370
to figure it out with me.

314
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.954
(solemn music)

315
00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:27.009
(crickets chirping)

316
00:17:28.563 --> 00:17:29.434
A lot of you guys

317
00:17:29.434 --> 00:17:32.164
have had questions
since I've been offline.

318
00:17:32.164 --> 00:17:35.978
so I thought we could do a
little cozy Q and A session.

319
00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:41.503
Okay. This is one I've been getting a lot.

320
00:17:41.503 --> 00:17:43.653
"When will you get back on the road?"

321
00:17:45.306 --> 00:17:47.016
Probably not soon.

322
00:17:47.016 --> 00:17:49.027
The doc said it's at least three months

323
00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:50.287
until I can drive again.

324
00:17:50.287 --> 00:17:54.188
and. honestly. I think
I might need longer.

325
00:17:54.188 --> 00:17:55.838
You know. I'm just not in a rush.

326
00:17:55.838 --> 00:18:00.839
and I just know I can bring a
good. new energy to this place

327
00:18:01.179 --> 00:18:04.749
and I wanna share my
experiences with you guys

328
00:18:04.749 --> 00:18:07.753
and I want you guys to
send me positive vibes.

329
00:18:10.162 --> 00:18:13.031
Okay. hold on. We're having
trouble with the internet.

330
00:18:13.031 --> 00:18:15.044
Okay. There we go.

331
00:18:16.153 --> 00:18:18.342
(books creak)

332
00:18:18.342 --> 00:18:21.575
Did you guys see that?
(ominous music)

333
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.323
(ominous music continues)

334
00:18:30.323 --> 00:18:31.406
(Ava gasps)
(mouse squeaks)

335
00:18:31.406 --> 00:18:32.804
Aw!

336
00:18:32.804 --> 00:18:34.394
Did you miss me?

337
00:18:34.394 --> 00:18:35.685
Okay. come here. Nope.

338
00:18:35.685 --> 00:18:38.535
No. no. no. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. In you go.

339
00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:39.585
I would like it

340
00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:43.249
if you found a home of
your own. little ghost.

341
00:18:48.167 --> 00:18:52.067
Mystery solved. but my
heart is still racing.

342
00:18:52.067 --> 00:18:55.843
so I think maybe that's
where we call it a night.

343
00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:56.801
Mhm.

344
00:18:56.801 --> 00:18:57.799
Mwah!

00:20:35.555 --> 00:20:36.998
I gotta run. Bye.

363
00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:38.818
Hello.

364
00:20:41.586 --> 00:20:43.886
I was hoping you could
help me with a cabin.

365
00:20:45.822 --> 00:20:50.377
What have you sold recently?
Any small fixer-uppers?

366
00:20:50.377 --> 00:20:53.168
If I saw some of those properties.

367
00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:56.624
maybe I'd get a better
sense of the marketplace.

368
00:20:56.624 --> 00:20:59.542
(foreboding music)

369
00:21:06.194 --> 00:21:09.944
(foreboding music continues)

370
00:21:15.999 --> 00:21:19.750
(foreboding music continues)

371
00:21:26.069 --> 00:21:29.820
(foreboding music continues)

372
00:21:36.107 --> 00:21:39.857
(foreboding music continues)

373
00:21:46.006 --> 00:21:49.757
(foreboding music continues)

374
00:21:56.189 --> 00:21:59.940
(foreboding music continues)

375
00:22:05.915 --> 00:22:09.665
(foreboding music continues)

376
00:22:17.116 --> 00:22:20.033
(car horn honking)

377
00:22:26.004 --> 00:22:30.172
(rock music indistinctly playing)

378
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.562
Hey there. Can I give
you a ride somewhere?

379
00:22:36.562 --> 00:22:37.825
No. no. it's okay.

380
00:22:37.825 --> 00:22:41.069
I'm enjoying riding a bike.
and. you know. the quiet.

381
00:22:42.164 --> 00:22:43.706
Well. it's a ways into town.

382
00:22:43.706 --> 00:22:45.779
I'm vlogging. and. you know. I'm good.

383
00:22:47.187 --> 00:22:48.922
Just stop by the shop. okay?

384
00:22:48.922 --> 00:22:50.757
Your rear tire's looking a little flat.

385
00:22:50.757 --> 00:22:52.167
I can pump it up for you.

386
00:22:52.167 --> 00:22:54.241
I'm sure you can.

387
00:22:54.241 --> 00:22:57.088
(Kellen chuckles)

388
00:22:57.088 --> 00:22:58.409
All right. I'll see you.

389
00:22:58.409 --> 00:22:59.368
See you.

390
00:22:59.368 --> 00:23:03.535
(rock music indistinctly playing)

391
00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.914
(gentle music indistinctly playing)

392
00:23:13.064 --> 00:23:15.421
Hey. How'd that varnish work out?

393
00:23:15.421 --> 00:23:17.222
Great. Best ever.

394
00:23:17.222 --> 00:23:18.932
Now I need a new latch for my shed.

395
00:23:18.932 --> 00:23:21.035
Oh. yeah. let's see. Yep.

396
00:23:24.003 --> 00:23:24.853
Let's call it 30.

397
00:23:27.513 --> 00:23:29.194
Good morning. sheriff.

398
00:23:29.194 --> 00:23:30.814
Popcorn machine working?

399
00:23:30.814 --> 00:23:32.374
Triple butter. just the way you like it.

400
00:23:32.374 --> 00:23:35.855
Oh. son. you never disappoint.

401
00:23:35.855 --> 00:23:36.688
Ma'am.

402
00:23:38.195 --> 00:23:39.831
Always a pleasure. miss.

403
00:23:39.831 --> 00:23:42.415
(gentle music)

404
00:23:49.787 --> 00:23:52.851
(gentle music continues)

405
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:54.665
(Ava sighs)

406
00:23:54.665 --> 00:23:59.666
(bike pump whirring)
(rock music playing)

407
00:24:02.534 --> 00:24:04.254
All right.

408
00:24:04.254 --> 00:24:06.040
Well. you might have a slow leak.

409
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.000
but I can order a new tire.

410
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.582
It'll probably get here
in a couple of days.

411
00:24:08.582 --> 00:24:11.180
Oh. yeah. that's great. Yeah.

412
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.688
Well. thank you.

413
00:24:13.688 --> 00:24:15.491
You sure you don't want that ride?

414
00:24:15.491 --> 00:24:16.933
I'm good.

415
00:24:16.933 --> 00:24:18.172
(eerie music)

416
00:24:18.172 --> 00:24:19.125
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

417
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:20.893
Are you all right?

418
00:24:20.893 --> 00:24:24.049
Yeah. yeah. I'll take that ride.

419
00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:25.382
Cool. Come on.

420
00:24:27.858 --> 00:24:31.442
(thunder faintly rumbling)

421
00:24:31.442 --> 00:24:34.359
(foreboding music)

422
00:24:41.827 --> 00:24:44.646
(foreboding music continues)

423
00:24:44.646 --> 00:24:47.480
(engine rumbling)

424
00:24:54.137 --> 00:24:57.887
(foreboding music continues)

425
00:25:04.464 --> 00:25:08.215
(foreboding music continues)

426
00:25:14.348 --> 00:25:17.099
(birds chirping)

427
00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:21.676
(Ava and Kellen chuckle)

428
00:25:22.689 --> 00:25:25.223
How do you like living out
here in the middle of nowhere?

429
00:25:25.223 --> 00:25:28.136
It's not nowhere. It's here.

430
00:25:29.713 --> 00:25:30.987
I like the solitude.

431
00:25:33.354 --> 00:25:34.187
Yeah. I bet.

432
00:25:34.187 --> 00:25:35.021
Being a big internet star.

433
00:25:35.021 --> 00:25:37.192
you probably get all kinds of
weirdos bothering you. right?

434
00:25:37.192 --> 00:25:38.025
Mhm.

435
00:25:39.385 --> 00:25:41.636
There was one guy who kept coming to

436
00:25:41.636 --> 00:25:43.636
my meet and greets all over the country.

437
00:25:44.523 --> 00:25:47.524
I woke up to him trying to break
into my van with handcuffs.

438
00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:52.667
What did you do?

439
00:25:52.667 --> 00:25:53.938
It was a nightmare.

440
00:25:53.938 --> 00:25:56.341
The police got involved
and it was just a mess.

441
00:25:57.777 --> 00:26:00.278
(drill whirs)

442
00:26:04.199 --> 00:26:06.363
You ever hear of Hannah Granger?

443
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.390
Sure. Everyone around here has.

444
00:26:11.474 --> 00:26:12.674
She lived in my cabin.

445
00:26:14.401 --> 00:26:15.691
No way.

446
00:26:15.691 --> 00:26:16.524
Yep.

447
00:26:17.702 --> 00:26:20.315
So. what's her story?

448
00:26:23.403 --> 00:26:24.603
You really wanna know?

449
00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:26.666
Yeah.

450
00:26:30.904 --> 00:26:32.227
This is beautiful.

451
00:26:34.114 --> 00:26:35.965
Beats the Walmart parking lot. huh?

452
00:26:36.875 --> 00:26:40.716
That's my line. Are you
sure you're not a subscriber?

453
00:26:40.716 --> 00:26:44.196
So they say Hannah was an actual witch.

454
00:26:44.196 --> 00:26:46.056
and after she jumped from this bridge.

455
00:26:46.056 --> 00:26:48.367
everyone started calling
it Suicide Bridge.

456
00:26:48.367 --> 00:26:50.287
and if you stand too close to the edge.

457
00:26:50.287 --> 00:26:51.907
Hannah's ghost will push you off.

458
00:26:51.907 --> 00:26:53.502
Yikes.

459
00:26:53.502 --> 00:26:56.780
Or. worse. possess
your soul for eternity.

460
00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.409
Aw. Sounds like wholesome fun.

461
00:26:59.409 --> 00:27:00.709
It was scary as hell

462
00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:04.900
This one time. some kid really flipped out

463
00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.880
'cause he thought he saw a ghost.

464
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.208
Almost fell in. Kind
of stopped after that.

465
00:27:10.208 --> 00:27:12.876
(ominous music)

466
00:27:20.297 --> 00:27:23.798
(ominous music continues)

467
00:27:26.143 --> 00:27:28.977
(engine rumbling)

468
00:27:30.146 --> 00:27:32.396
(cow moos)

469
00:27:40.106 --> 00:27:45.107
(birds chirping)
(gentle music)

470
00:27:49.157 --> 00:27:51.020
Are you lost?

471
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.604
(gentle music)

472
00:28:01.043 --> 00:28:03.876
(camera clicking)

473
00:28:08.128 --> 00:28:10.629
(eerie music)

474
00:28:12.708 --> 00:28:15.291
(tires squeal)

475
00:28:18.002 --> 00:28:19.782
(phone clicks)

476
00:28:19.782 --> 00:28:21.502
Hi. Is this the sheriff?

477
00:28:21.502 --> 00:28:23.903
Someone's cow got loose
and ended up in my yard.

478
00:28:28.174 --> 00:28:29.008
Shit.

479
00:28:32.008 --> 00:28:34.341
(Ava sighs)

480
00:28:35.722 --> 00:28:38.305
(solemn music)

481
00:28:43.892 --> 00:28:48.357
(lively radio music playing)

482
00:28:48.357 --> 00:28:52.020
Hey. guys. I thought I'd give
you guys a little update.

483
00:28:52.978 --> 00:28:57.568
Cabin life has been very peaceful.

484
00:28:57.568 --> 00:28:59.759
Kellen came over today to fix my latch.

485
00:28:59.759 --> 00:29:02.009
and don't get any dirty ideas.

486
00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:05.278
He actually fixed the latch on my shed.

487
00:29:05.278 --> 00:29:06.840
(Kellen chuckles)

488
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.003
But he gave me the scoop on Hannah.

489
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:14.871
and she was into witchcraft or a Wiccan.

490
00:29:15.331 --> 00:29:19.085
I just wish I knew what she
was going through. because.

491
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.926
why would she do that?

492
00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:26.433
When I lost my parents.

493
00:29:26.433 --> 00:29:28.564
I still felt like they were around me.

494
00:29:28.564 --> 00:29:32.377
like I could just close my
eyes and they'd be by me.

495
00:29:33.934 --> 00:29:36.845
and I just feel like our energy

496
00:29:36.845 --> 00:29:40.085
has to make an imprint in this world.

497
00:29:40.085 --> 00:29:42.006
I mean. especially after

498
00:29:42.006 --> 00:29:44.156
everything we go through
in life. you know?

499
00:29:45.186 --> 00:29:49.300
So. maybe Hannah spirit's still here.

500
00:29:51.007 --> 00:29:54.398
or maybe I'm getting a little
woo-woo in the woods alone

501
00:29:54.398 --> 00:29:55.388
after all this time.

502
00:29:55.388 --> 00:29:56.221
I don't know.

503
00:29:57.548 --> 00:29:58.539
It's getting a little dark.

504
00:29:58.539 --> 00:30:01.242
so I think I'm gonna go
ahead and call it tonight.

505
00:30:01.242 --> 00:30:02.257
Bye. guys.

506
00:30:02.257 --> 00:30:07.258
(foreboding music)
(crickets chirping)

507
00:30:12.308 --> 00:30:16.058
(foreboding music continues)

508
00:30:20.182 --> 00:30:22.015
Ava.

509
00:30:24.192 --> 00:30:26.692
(eerie music)

510
00:30:34.523 --> 00:30:37.856
(eerie music continues)

511
00:30:42.901 --> 00:30:44.147
You?

512
00:30:44.147 --> 00:30:46.648
(eerie music)

513
00:30:52.179 --> 00:30:55.180
(crickets chirping)

514
00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.407
(ominous music)

515
00:31:10.265 --> 00:31:13.486
(ominous music continues)
(book thumps)

516
00:31:13.486 --> 00:31:15.986
(books thump)

517
00:31:23.539 --> 00:31:27.039
(ominous music continues)

518
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:37.051
(ominous music continues)

519
00:31:43.352 --> 00:31:48.353
(crickets chirping)
(solemn music)

520
00:31:53.449 --> 00:31:56.866
(solemn music continues)

521
00:32:03.527 --> 00:32:06.945
(solemn music continues)

522
00:32:10.969 --> 00:32:13.331
Sorry to bother you. ma'am.

523
00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:16.556
It's fine. I was just resting my eyes.

524
00:32:16.556 --> 00:32:19.160
I got that call about the cow.

525
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.255
Did you find it?

526
00:32:21.362 --> 00:32:24.183
Sure did. I had to put her down.

527
00:32:24.183 --> 00:32:25.140
What? Why?

528
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.783
Oh. well. the coyotes got to her.

529
00:32:27.783 --> 00:32:29.348
Tore her near to pieces.

530
00:32:29.348 --> 00:32:30.964
(tires squeal)

531
00:32:30.964 --> 00:32:32.554
She was still breathing.
(eerie music)

532
00:32:32.554 --> 00:32:36.818
Unfortunately. that's what
can happen around here.

533
00:32:37.835 --> 00:32:40.536
You're new here. right?

534
00:32:40.536 --> 00:32:41.936
Welcome to the neighborhood.

535
00:32:43.512 --> 00:32:46.450
If you see any more of
'em. give us a call.

536
00:32:47.527 --> 00:32:50.900
Have a nice day.
(solemn music)

537
00:32:52.102 --> 00:32:55.688
Like. I know I was glad
that you were back. Ava.

538
00:32:55.688 --> 00:32:57.848
and. like. I'm sorry
if you're seeing this.

539
00:32:57.848 --> 00:33:01.749
'cause I was. like. your
most loyal follower and fan.

540
00:33:01.749 --> 00:33:04.179
but. like. I really miss the old Ava.

541
00:33:04.179 --> 00:33:05.560
Like. I don't know who this is.

542
00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.580
I don't know where she's gone.

543
00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.250
but. please. please. old Ava. come back.

544
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:12.700
because this is just some weird shit.

545
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.181
Like. who actually believes
in all this ghost crap?

546
00:33:16.181 --> 00:33:17.015
Hey. everyone.

547
00:33:17.015 --> 00:33:19.332
I just wanted to say I'm
so glad that Ava is back.

548
00:33:19.332 --> 00:33:21.942
She's alive and well. That's
the only thing that matters.

549
00:33:21.942 --> 00:33:25.003
Her last video. though.
a little bit sketch.

550
00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:26.983
Not gonna comment on
that now. though. because

551
00:33:26.983 --> 00:33:28.093
I'm gonna go hit the road.
Oh. shit.

552
00:33:28.093 --> 00:33:30.434
Don't forget to like
and subscribe to Van Doll.

553
00:33:30.434 --> 00:33:31.634
How are the headaches?

554
00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:34.017
Pretty bad.

555
00:33:34.017 --> 00:33:35.508
What about vision?

556
00:33:38.295 --> 00:33:42.656
Well. I'm having visions.

557
00:33:43.857 --> 00:33:45.616
(ghost gasps)

558
00:33:45.616 --> 00:33:46.967
Well. okay.

559
00:33:46.967 --> 00:33:51.752
Hallucinations are not that
uncommon after a head injury.

560
00:33:51.752 --> 00:33:54.328
Ava. it's very important to remember that

561
00:33:56.208 --> 00:34:00.082
these moments and
experiences are not real.

562
00:34:01.129 --> 00:34:03.952
A few deep breaths and they will pass.

563
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.513
A few nights of good rest
should really make a difference.

564
00:34:09.558 --> 00:34:12.142
(solemn music)

565
00:34:20.801 --> 00:34:25.219
(country music indistinctly playing)

566
00:34:29.934 --> 00:34:33.774
Hey. Ava. Welcome.
and what will you have?

567
00:34:33.774 --> 00:34:37.025
A cold beer and the wifi password.

568
00:34:37.025 --> 00:34:38.605
"Fuckrightoff."

569
00:34:38.605 --> 00:34:40.075
Excuse me?

570
00:34:40.075 --> 00:34:41.376
Oh. that's the password.

571
00:34:43.316 --> 00:34:44.756
All lowercase.

572
00:34:44.756 --> 00:34:45.589
Got it.

573
00:34:52.786 --> 00:34:55.453
(ominous music)

574
00:35:02.782 --> 00:35:05.430
(ominous music continues)

575
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.440
Can I ask you a question?

576
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.280
Shoot.

577
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.581
Is this how you spell
Hannah Granger's name?

578
00:35:11.611 --> 00:35:12.444
Oh. honey.

579
00:35:12.444 --> 00:35:14.344
you're not gonna find
anything online about her.

580
00:35:14.344 --> 00:35:16.032
Look where you are.

581
00:35:16.032 --> 00:35:18.005
No one in this town is blogging.

582
00:35:19.532 --> 00:35:20.365
Great.

583
00:35:20.365 --> 00:35:22.803
I just wanna find a little history

584
00:35:22.803 --> 00:35:25.596
about the place I sunk
all my life savings into.

585
00:35:26.629 --> 00:35:29.404
I might be able to help.

586
00:35:29.404 --> 00:35:32.317
My dad was a hoarder.
so we might get lucky.

587
00:35:33.274 --> 00:35:34.107
Come with me.

588
00:35:38.555 --> 00:35:39.388
Happy hunting.

589
00:35:43.176 --> 00:35:44.346
Take whatever you want.

590
00:35:44.346 --> 00:35:45.179
Thank you.

591
00:35:54.329 --> 00:35:56.912
(somber music)

592
00:36:04.439 --> 00:36:06.227
(somber music continues)

593
00:36:06.227 --> 00:36:07.510
"Elijah Granger has been

594
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:10.027
declared a suspect in his sister's death."

595
00:36:12.018 --> 00:36:14.651
"Elijah Granger has been
declared mentally unfit

596
00:36:14.651 --> 00:36:16.839
after also attempting to kill himself."

597
00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:24.703
"Committed to Brassard Institution.

598
00:36:24.703 --> 00:36:25.903
Little hope of recovery

599
00:36:25.903 --> 00:36:29.571
due to brain damage suffered
in the suicide attempt."

600
00:36:29.571 --> 00:36:32.861
"Hannah Granger's death
officially ruled suicide."

601
00:36:33.874 --> 00:36:36.458
(somber music)

602
00:36:43.394 --> 00:36:45.316
(country music indistinctly playing)

603
00:36:45.316 --> 00:36:47.117
Did you find what you need?

604
00:36:47.117 --> 00:36:48.740
More questions than answers.

605
00:36:49.708 --> 00:36:51.950
Why do you think Hannah jumped?

606
00:36:52.998 --> 00:36:54.408
I'm not sure she did.

607
00:36:54.408 --> 00:36:55.818
Back in the 1600s.

608
00:36:55.818 --> 00:36:58.819
they would push accused
witches off a high cliff.

609
00:36:58.819 --> 00:37:02.179
because. if she was a
witch. she'd fly away.

610
00:37:02.179 --> 00:37:03.859
You think she was pushed?

611
00:37:03.859 --> 00:37:05.630
I wouldn't rule it out.

612
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:09.435
The Grangers were a
powerful. wealthy family.

613
00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:11.934
and you know money can
always buy innocence.

614
00:37:13.085 --> 00:37:15.385
Then why was she living
in my old-ass cabin?

615
00:37:16.252 --> 00:37:18.022
Oh. they disowned her.

616
00:37:18.022 --> 00:37:20.005
She just wound up there. I guess.

617
00:37:23.573 --> 00:37:25.373
You know. I had a dream about her.

618
00:37:26.903 --> 00:37:29.457
and I can't get it out of my head.

619
00:37:32.664 --> 00:37:35.015
Do you think she's trying
to tell me something?

620
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.818
(country music indistinctly playing)

621
00:37:43.646 --> 00:37:45.489
You gotta be kidding.

622
00:37:45.489 --> 00:37:48.270
Unless you know a way to DM a dead girl.

623
00:37:49.815 --> 00:37:50.880
Eh. worth a shot.

624
00:37:51.897 --> 00:37:54.391
You know not to use that alone. right?

625
00:37:55.468 --> 00:37:56.301
Really?

626
00:37:56.301 --> 00:37:58.229
I'm sure Kellen would
be happy to join you.

627
00:37:59.339 --> 00:38:00.172
Thanks again.

628
00:38:00.172 --> 00:38:01.769
Oh!
Oh. shoot.

629
00:38:01.769 --> 00:38:03.313
I am so sorry.
Oh.

630
00:38:03.313 --> 00:38:04.980
No. no. it's my fault. My fault.

631
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.990
No. no. I was distracted.

632
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:08.430
Shit.
No. no. it's okay.

633
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:09.509
No. you don't have to.

634
00:38:09.509 --> 00:38:10.343
No. no. no. no.
No. no.

635
00:38:10.343 --> 00:38:12.688
I hope this wasn't expensive.
Can I pay for dry cleaning?

636
00:38:12.688 --> 00:38:14.431
No. no. no.

637
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:15.721
Okay.

638
00:38:15.721 --> 00:38:18.335
Well. I'm a mess today. so sorry again.

639
00:38:19.502 --> 00:38:21.542
Meet my new friend. Jody.

640
00:38:21.542 --> 00:38:22.376
Jackie.

641
00:38:22.376 --> 00:38:23.823
It's so amazing to meet you. Ava.

642
00:38:23.823 --> 00:38:25.983
I've been watching your
videos for so long.

643
00:38:25.983 --> 00:38:28.324
You totally inspired me to get my own van

644
00:38:28.324 --> 00:38:29.524
and hit the road.

645
00:38:29.524 --> 00:38:33.087
That calls for a toast! Woo!

646
00:38:33.087 --> 00:38:34.325
I just had a thought

647
00:38:34.325 --> 00:38:37.115
I don't think enough
people are thinking about.

648
00:38:37.115 --> 00:38:41.346
Hannah Granger jumped. or
was pushed from a high spot.

649
00:38:41.346 --> 00:38:42.906
which is exactly how

650
00:38:42.906 --> 00:38:44.616
they used to try witches back in the day.

651
00:38:44.616 --> 00:38:45.606
push you off a cliff.

652
00:38:45.606 --> 00:38:47.767
and if you flew. oh. you're witch.

653
00:38:47.767 --> 00:38:49.987
and if you didn't. oh. our bad.

654
00:38:49.987 --> 00:38:51.160
Try again next time.

655
00:38:52.516 --> 00:38:57.008
I'm gonna go to the cemetery
right now. See what I can see.

656
00:38:57.008 --> 00:38:58.599
See if there's any hints or...

657
00:38:59.572 --> 00:39:02.239
(ominous music)

658
00:39:09.836 --> 00:39:13.337
(ominous music continues)

659
00:39:19.862 --> 00:39:23.363
(ominous music continues)

660
00:39:29.382 --> 00:39:32.882
(ominous music continues)

661
00:39:39.339 --> 00:39:42.840
(ominous music continues)

662
00:39:49.307 --> 00:39:52.808
(ominous music continues)

663
00:39:59.359 --> 00:40:02.859
(ominous music continues)

664
00:40:09.135 --> 00:40:12.636
(ominous music continues)

665
00:40:16.895 --> 00:40:19.895
(suspenseful music)

666
00:40:26.635 --> 00:40:30.469
(suspenseful music continues)

667
00:40:32.969 --> 00:40:34.720
What happened to you?

668
00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.523
(solemn music)

669
00:40:45.536 --> 00:40:48.954
(solemn music continues)

670
00:40:54.391 --> 00:40:58.319
Hey. guys. I'm at the cemetery
where Hannah's buried.

671
00:40:58.319 --> 00:41:01.409
I'm starting to wonder what
really happened to her.

672
00:41:01.409 --> 00:41:03.479
It doesn't make any sense.

673
00:41:03.479 --> 00:41:05.902
I mean. who knows?

674
00:41:05.902 --> 00:41:08.463
Maybe I'm gonna solve a murder cover-up.

675
00:41:11.554 --> 00:41:14.137
(door squeaks)

676
00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:26.741
(engine rumbling)
(rock music playing)

677
00:41:31.474 --> 00:41:34.214
Hey. Cabin Girl. I got your new tire.

678
00:41:34.214 --> 00:41:35.738
Oh. thank God.

679
00:41:36.905 --> 00:41:37.738
Or me.

680
00:41:37.738 --> 00:41:38.571
Uh-uh.

681
00:41:41.492 --> 00:41:44.242
(birds chirping)

682
00:41:51.386 --> 00:41:53.521
(engine rumbling)

683
00:41:53.521 --> 00:41:55.471
Haven't you ever seen "The Exorcist"?

684
00:41:57.969 --> 00:41:59.817
Maybe I'm already possessed.

685
00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:03.279
(Kellen chuckles)

686
00:42:03.279 --> 00:42:04.337
I keep seeing her.

687
00:42:09.729 --> 00:42:12.397
(ominous music)

688
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:23.211
(ominous music continues)

689
00:42:29.351 --> 00:42:32.851
(ominous music continues)

690
00:42:39.324 --> 00:42:42.825
(ominous music continues)

691
00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:53.117
(ominous music continues)

692
00:42:53.117 --> 00:42:56.450
(truck engine rumbling)

693
00:43:03.266 --> 00:43:04.100
Thanks.

694
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.933
Do you have some time to kill?

695
00:43:11.419 --> 00:43:12.252
Sure.

696
00:43:17.601 --> 00:43:19.359
What the hell?

697
00:43:19.359 --> 00:43:20.752
It was probably tweakers.

698
00:43:20.752 --> 00:43:23.447
They like to break into
old sheds and shoot up.

699
00:43:23.447 --> 00:43:26.603
Tweakers and ghosts. Anything
else I need to know about?

700
00:43:26.603 --> 00:43:28.644
You got that price for a
reason. This ain't Beverly Hills.

701
00:43:28.644 --> 00:43:30.492
Here. Let me check.

702
00:43:30.492 --> 00:43:33.159
(ominous music)

703
00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:38.095
Well.

704
00:43:38.095 --> 00:43:39.028
another day.

705
00:43:40.053 --> 00:43:42.720
(ominous music)

706
00:43:49.742 --> 00:43:53.243
(ominous music continues)

707
00:44:00.105 --> 00:44:02.159
Okay. Do you really need to do that?

708
00:44:02.159 --> 00:44:04.383
Yes. It's proof.

709
00:44:04.383 --> 00:44:07.470
I should not have told
you about Hannah Granger.

710
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:10.591
Look. I know this is a little out there.

711
00:44:10.591 --> 00:44:15.591
but I really feel like she's
trying to tell me something.

712
00:44:17.102 --> 00:44:18.485
I feel it.

713
00:44:19.802 --> 00:44:21.692
Did you know her brother was a suspect?

714
00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:22.893
Hey. but she killed herself. okay?

715
00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:23.913
I don't blame the poor girl.

716
00:44:23.913 --> 00:44:26.096
There's not many other
ways out of this town.

717
00:44:28.084 --> 00:44:29.344
That's a little morbid.

718
00:44:29.344 --> 00:44:30.177
Yeah. well. you're trying to

719
00:44:30.177 --> 00:44:33.227
talk to a dead girl on a Ouija board. so.

720
00:44:33.227 --> 00:44:34.668
So. let's go.

721
00:44:35.735 --> 00:44:36.568
Come on.

722
00:44:36.568 --> 00:44:41.399
You take two fingers and you
place them on the planchette.

723
00:44:41.399 --> 00:44:43.982
(gentle music)

724
00:44:45.336 --> 00:44:47.617
I didn't know this was
gonna be so romantic.

725
00:44:47.617 --> 00:44:48.580
Let's focus.

726
00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:51.430
Close your eyes.

727
00:44:53.408 --> 00:44:55.721
Open your mind and heart.

728
00:45:00.946 --> 00:45:02.029
Are you here?

729
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:06.733
Hannah Granger?

730
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:09.643
What do you wanna tell us?

731
00:45:10.481 --> 00:45:12.311
Yeah. I'm gonna need
some more wine for this.

732
00:45:12.311 --> 00:45:14.206
Okay. Box by the sink.

733
00:45:14.206 --> 00:45:15.635
Okay.

734
00:45:15.635 --> 00:45:20.636
(foreboding music)
(Ava sighs)

735
00:45:21.344 --> 00:45:24.678
Hannah. can you please give me a sign?

736
00:45:26.318 --> 00:45:28.514
(eerie music)

737
00:45:28.514 --> 00:45:29.347
Hello?

738
00:45:30.607 --> 00:45:32.534
You're kidding.

739
00:45:32.534 --> 00:45:33.828
I'm not doing this.

740
00:45:34.875 --> 00:45:35.708
G.

741
00:45:39.766 --> 00:45:40.599
U.

742
00:45:41.874 --> 00:45:43.556
Yeah. okay.

743
00:45:43.556 --> 00:45:44.389
I.

744
00:45:45.699 --> 00:45:46.937
L.
Ava. you're moving-

745
00:45:46.937 --> 00:45:47.810
I'm not!

746
00:45:50.567 --> 00:45:51.400
T.

747
00:45:57.139 --> 00:45:57.973
Y.

748
00:45:59.732 --> 00:46:00.712
"Guilty." Okay.

749
00:46:00.712 --> 00:46:01.879
Ava. don't bullshit me.

750
00:46:01.879 --> 00:46:04.269
Hannah. who is guilty?

751
00:46:04.269 --> 00:46:06.680
Who tried to kill you. Hannah?

752
00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.981
Hannah? Hannah. who's guilty?

753
00:46:09.981 --> 00:46:11.484
Who pushed you off the bridge?

754
00:46:13.782 --> 00:46:14.865
Hannah?

755
00:46:14.865 --> 00:46:17.366
(tense music)

756
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.621
(Ava grunts)

757
00:46:21.621 --> 00:46:22.455
God damn it.

758
00:46:22.455 --> 00:46:23.363
Hey. Okay. relax.

759
00:46:23.363 --> 00:46:25.913
You are taking this
shit way too seriously.

760
00:46:25.913 --> 00:46:27.213
She didn't kill herself.

761
00:46:28.824 --> 00:46:30.657
Somebody killed her.

762
00:46:31.884 --> 00:46:35.335
Maybe you should take a break
from this place for a while.

763
00:46:35.335 --> 00:46:36.971
You know. just go back.

764
00:46:36.971 --> 00:46:37.948
To where?

765
00:46:40.346 --> 00:46:41.519
I've lost my parents.

766
00:46:43.766 --> 00:46:45.461
This is my home now.

767
00:46:45.461 --> 00:46:48.045
(gentle music)

768
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:58.928
(gentle music continues)

769
00:47:03.556 --> 00:47:05.403
At least that's healing nicely.

770
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:08.183
You had me worried there.

771
00:47:08.183 --> 00:47:10.866
You're the only person I know
that could drive 200 miles

772
00:47:10.866 --> 00:47:13.216
with a busted radiator
and one headlight light.

773
00:47:14.551 --> 00:47:16.752
You'd tell me if you
had superpowers. right?

774
00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:24.183
I know I've said this a thousand times.

775
00:47:24.183 --> 00:47:27.306
but thank you again for that night.

776
00:47:30.394 --> 00:47:32.721
Is anything starting
to come back to you?

777
00:47:32.721 --> 00:47:35.288
No. It's all kind of a blur.

778
00:47:38.421 --> 00:47:41.653
I just really think it
happened for a reason.

779
00:47:43.744 --> 00:47:46.980
I got up the road. I got my dream cabin.

780
00:47:49.027 --> 00:47:50.051
and I met you.

781
00:47:50.051 --> 00:47:52.635
(gentle music)

782
00:47:59.846 --> 00:48:03.263
(gentle music continues)

783
00:48:06.907 --> 00:48:07.810
Oh my God!
(eerie music)

784
00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:09.100
What?

785
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:13.241
There's somebody there.
There's somebody outside.

786
00:48:13.241 --> 00:48:14.231
There's somebody there!

787
00:48:14.231 --> 00:48:17.205
Okay. All right. just stay here.

788
00:48:17.205 --> 00:48:22.206
(ominous music)
(crickets chirping)

789
00:48:27.512 --> 00:48:31.013
(ominous music continues)

790
00:48:34.515 --> 00:48:36.315
Go shoot up somewhere else. asshole!

791
00:48:37.599 --> 00:48:40.267
(ominous music)

792
00:48:47.756 --> 00:48:51.256
(ominous music continues)

793
00:48:57.608 --> 00:49:00.281
(ominous music continues)

794
00:49:00.281 --> 00:49:01.600
(Kellen knocking on door)

795
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.683
Hey. it's me.

796
00:49:06.183 --> 00:49:07.433
It's all clear.

797
00:49:08.734 --> 00:49:10.641
I didn't make that up.

798
00:49:10.641 --> 00:49:13.014
I saw somebody right there. I swear.

799
00:49:14.871 --> 00:49:16.635
You did say you were seeing Hannah.

800
00:49:19.732 --> 00:49:21.432
Here. why don't you just lay down?

801
00:49:22.527 --> 00:49:24.610
Just lay down right here.

802
00:49:26.984 --> 00:49:27.818
Okay.

803
00:49:31.521 --> 00:49:32.367
All right.

804
00:49:33.204 --> 00:49:37.759
Hey. I'm gonna stay here while
you sleep and keep guard.

805
00:49:37.759 --> 00:49:40.343
(gentle music)

806
00:49:41.357 --> 00:49:44.024
No ghost is gonna mess with you.

807
00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:50.680
Okay.
(gentle music)

808
00:49:51.615 --> 00:49:54.994
(crickets chirping)

809
00:49:54.994 --> 00:49:59.995
♪ In your dreams ♪
(rock music playing)

810
00:50:00.933 --> 00:50:05.934
♪ Oh. oh. oh. oh. in your dreams ♪

811
00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.447
♪ Oh. oh. oh ♪

812
00:50:09.447 --> 00:50:11.948
(eerie music)

813
00:50:15.341 --> 00:50:19.509
(rock music indistinctly playing)

814
00:50:25.149 --> 00:50:27.817
(ominous music)

815
00:50:35.725 --> 00:50:39.225
(ominous music continues)

816
00:50:45.683 --> 00:50:49.183
(ominous music continues)

817
00:50:55.529 --> 00:50:59.030
(ominous music continues)

818
00:51:04.307 --> 00:51:07.974
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

819
00:51:09.408 --> 00:51:10.769
Hey.

820
00:51:10.769 --> 00:51:13.436
Who said you could fix my van?

821
00:51:14.341 --> 00:51:16.299
I was just trying to help you.

822
00:51:16.299 --> 00:51:18.702
Trying to help the poor orphan girl?

823
00:51:18.702 --> 00:51:19.782
No. No.

824
00:51:19.782 --> 00:51:20.615
Oh. poor Ava!

825
00:51:20.615 --> 00:51:21.449
Hey. hey. hey.

826
00:51:21.449 --> 00:51:22.282
She has no one to go back to.

827
00:51:22.282 --> 00:51:24.587
Hey. okay. can you just calm
down for one second. please?

828
00:51:24.587 --> 00:51:25.420
Leave.

829
00:51:28.171 --> 00:51:29.004
Go!

830
00:51:29.004 --> 00:51:30.337
Go!
Okay. okay.

831
00:51:31.681 --> 00:51:34.432
(birds chirping)

832
00:51:40.814 --> 00:51:42.556
(engine rumbling)

833
00:51:42.556 --> 00:51:45.073
(somber music)

834
00:51:45.073 --> 00:51:47.657
(engine roars)

835
00:51:51.087 --> 00:51:53.421
(Ava sighs)

836
00:52:00.933 --> 00:52:04.351
(somber music continues)

837
00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:10.210
(tires squeal)
(wood thumping)

838
00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:13.499
(Ava screams)

839
00:52:13.499 --> 00:52:18.500
(wood thumping)
(tense music)

840
00:52:20.686 --> 00:52:23.354
(ominous music)

841
00:52:30.773 --> 00:52:34.274
(ominous music continues)

842
00:52:40.671 --> 00:52:43.254
(solemn music)

843
00:52:50.745 --> 00:52:54.163
(solemn music continues)

844
00:53:00.966 --> 00:53:04.384
(solemn music continues)

845
00:53:11.016 --> 00:53:14.433
(solemn music continues)

846
00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.397
(knocking on door)

847
00:53:22.258 --> 00:53:23.091
Hey.
Hi.

848
00:53:23.091 --> 00:53:24.049
What's going on?

849
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:25.049
Come here.

850
00:53:30.154 --> 00:53:32.974
I found this under the floorboards.

851
00:53:32.974 --> 00:53:34.655
I think it's her jewelry. and. last night.

852
00:53:34.655 --> 00:53:36.665
she was trying to contact
me using the Ouija board.

853
00:53:36.665 --> 00:53:38.705
She's trying to tell me who killed her.

854
00:53:38.705 --> 00:53:39.936
Okay.
But I need your help.

855
00:53:39.936 --> 00:53:41.739
Okay. Just one thing at a time.

856
00:53:42.936 --> 00:53:43.769
Huh.

857
00:53:45.397 --> 00:53:47.617
This is clear quartz.

858
00:53:47.617 --> 00:53:49.207
It's used as protection.

859
00:53:49.207 --> 00:53:51.358
She knew somebody
was trying to kill her.

860
00:53:53.948 --> 00:53:57.218
And the ring is rosewood.

861
00:53:57.218 --> 00:53:59.368
which can be used as a spell blocker.

862
00:53:59.368 --> 00:54:00.201
Okay.

863
00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.290
Now split the deck and
ask her your question.

864
00:54:09.551 --> 00:54:11.174
Who hurt you on the bridge?

865
00:54:12.064 --> 00:54:15.485
All right.
(mysterious music)

866
00:54:21.619 --> 00:54:26.286
The first card pertains to
the subject of your question.

867
00:54:29.834 --> 00:54:30.977
The Princess.

868
00:54:31.844 --> 00:54:33.645
So this card refers to

869
00:54:33.645 --> 00:54:36.615
the dominant individual in the situation.

870
00:54:36.615 --> 00:54:38.058
and it is a young woman.

871
00:54:39.466 --> 00:54:43.549
The next card is gonna pertain
to you. the questioner.

872
00:54:48.707 --> 00:54:49.910
The Devil?

873
00:54:51.678 --> 00:54:52.968
Is that me?

874
00:54:52.968 --> 00:54:57.228
Don't take it too literally.
These cards are symbolic.

875
00:54:57.228 --> 00:54:59.599
Let's move on to the next card.

876
00:54:59.599 --> 00:55:02.242
And what's the lesson to be learned?

877
00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:10.851
The Moon. It shines light on dark secrets.

878
00:55:10.851 --> 00:55:13.284
She's trying to reveal her secret to me.

879
00:55:15.262 --> 00:55:17.362
The Eight of Cups.

880
00:55:17.362 --> 00:55:21.533
This represents disappointment
and abandonment.

881
00:55:21.533 --> 00:55:24.116
Yeah. Hannah had enough of both.

882
00:55:27.444 --> 00:55:28.674
The Chariot.

883
00:55:28.674 --> 00:55:31.246
It represents courage. strength.

884
00:55:31.246 --> 00:55:36.247
and determination to move
forward. but it's reversed.

885
00:55:36.706 --> 00:55:38.395
What does that mean?

886
00:55:38.395 --> 00:55:40.556
Is there something that
you're running away from?

887
00:55:40.556 --> 00:55:42.006
Why are all these about me?

888
00:55:43.016 --> 00:55:46.677
I don't control the cards.
They show what they show.

889
00:55:48.557 --> 00:55:49.950
Okay. the last card.

890
00:55:51.147 --> 00:55:52.435
What's to come?

891
00:55:52.435 --> 00:55:55.352
(mysterious music)

892
00:55:59.459 --> 00:56:00.332
The Hanged Man.

893
00:56:02.909 --> 00:56:03.743
And?

894
00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:08.763
Traitors used to be hanged
upside down as retribution.

895
00:56:09.841 --> 00:56:13.501
but it can also mean self-sacrifice
as an act of atonement.

896
00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:18.155
Okay. so which was it? Did
she jump or was she pushed?

897
00:56:19.682 --> 00:56:22.113
It's not pointing to either of those.

898
00:56:22.113 --> 00:56:25.566
We expected Hannah's spirit
to be tied to this cabin.

899
00:56:26.493 --> 00:56:29.494
but everything here is telling me that.

900
00:56:29.494 --> 00:56:34.475
whatever it is you're sensing.
it didn't originate here.

901
00:56:34.475 --> 00:56:38.108
No. no. no. because it all
started when I moved here.

902
00:56:39.846 --> 00:56:43.249
I'm sorry. I'm not
getting that from the cards.

903
00:56:43.249 --> 00:56:45.917
(ominous music)

904
00:56:50.077 --> 00:56:50.910
Do it again.

905
00:56:53.928 --> 00:56:55.508
That's not how it works.

906
00:56:55.508 --> 00:56:56.738
Do it again.

907
00:56:56.738 --> 00:56:57.572
Ava.

908
00:56:57.572 --> 00:56:58.959
We have her jewelry.

909
00:56:58.959 --> 00:57:00.819
We have to help her. Do it again.

910
00:57:00.819 --> 00:57:04.090
Well. we're not even
sure that that's Hannah's.

911
00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:05.140
Now you don't believe me?

912
00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:08.020
I mean. you can't go
accusing people of murder.

913
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.611
No. You said it.

914
00:57:09.611 --> 00:57:13.451
You said the Grangers were
rich enough and powerful enough

915
00:57:13.451 --> 00:57:14.831
to cover this whole thing up.

916
00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:19.605
Yeah. but those are rumors
and this is real life.

917
00:57:21.643 --> 00:57:24.646
and you need to take a step back.

918
00:57:27.719 --> 00:57:31.964
Oh my God.

919
00:57:31.964 --> 00:57:33.315
You're covering for them.

920
00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:38.373
(Trina scoffs)

921
00:57:38.373 --> 00:57:40.606
How much did they pay you?

922
00:57:40.606 --> 00:57:42.499
Ava. stop it.

923
00:57:43.456 --> 00:57:44.289
Get out.

924
00:57:46.007 --> 00:57:47.807
Ava. please.

925
00:57:47.807 --> 00:57:49.419
Get the fuck out!

926
00:57:49.419 --> 00:57:51.920
(tense music)

927
00:57:55.924 --> 00:57:57.540
Fuck!

928
00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:00.207
(ominous music)

929
00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:11.118
(ominous music continues)

930
00:58:17.642 --> 00:58:21.143
(ominous music continues)

931
00:58:27.609 --> 00:58:31.109
(ominous music continues)

932
00:58:36.522 --> 00:58:38.252
(engine rumbles)

933
00:58:38.252 --> 00:58:40.856
"Elijah Granger has been
declared mentally unfit

934
00:58:40.856 --> 00:58:42.959
after also attempting to kill himself.

935
00:58:43.826 --> 00:58:46.317
Committed to Brassard Institution.

936
00:58:46.317 --> 00:58:47.547
Little hope of recovery

937
00:58:47.547 --> 00:58:51.152
due to brain damage suffered
in the suicide attempt.

938
00:58:51.152 --> 00:58:56.152
Mr. Catherian. the
night of Jolene's death.

939
00:58:56.479 --> 00:58:59.696
did he seem normal to you. or-

940
00:58:59.696 --> 00:59:01.296
Hi. I'm here to see a patient.

941
00:59:02.519 --> 00:59:03.510
Sign in.

942
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:05.163
He said he'd been
doing a lot of thinking

943
00:59:05.163 --> 00:59:07.500
and had reached a big decision.

944
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:10.201
Did he tell you what that decision was?

945
00:59:10.201 --> 00:59:11.398
Paging doctor-

946
00:59:11.398 --> 00:59:12.631
Well. he said that

947
00:59:12.631 --> 00:59:14.365
what he had decided would
change his whole life.

948
00:59:14.365 --> 00:59:15.699
and Moira's too.

949
00:59:17.312 --> 00:59:18.145
That will be all. Thank you.

950
00:59:18.145 --> 00:59:20.375
You're not gonna get much out of Elijah.

951
00:59:21.744 --> 00:59:24.251
I just wanna sit with him.

952
00:59:24.251 --> 00:59:25.803
Oh. that's nice.

953
00:59:25.803 --> 00:59:27.664
Just don't let his face scare you.

954
00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:30.124
I mean. you'd think he
couldn't miss at that range.

955
00:59:30.124 --> 00:59:30.957
What?

956
00:59:30.957 --> 00:59:32.224
I mean. you put the gun in your mouth.

957
00:59:32.224 --> 00:59:33.455
you can't miss. right?

958
00:59:33.455 --> 00:59:35.885
But. see. recoil pulls the gun forward.

959
00:59:35.885 --> 00:59:37.715
It blows off half your face

960
00:59:37.715 --> 00:59:39.996
and a sizeable chunk of your brain.

961
00:59:39.996 --> 00:59:44.712
Just not enough to do the job.
Hence. vegetable for life.

962
00:59:44.712 --> 00:59:47.296
(somber music)

963
00:59:54.098 --> 00:59:56.708
Mr. Granger. guess what?

964
00:59:56.708 --> 00:59:57.972
You got a visitor.

965
01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.660
(eerie music)

966
01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:10.271
When you're done or you need anything.

967
01:00:10.271 --> 01:00:11.671
just give me a holler. okay?

968
01:00:19.992 --> 01:00:20.865
Hi. Elijah.

969
01:00:21.913 --> 01:00:22.746
I'm Ava.

970
01:00:23.623 --> 01:00:25.846
I wanted to talk to you about your sister.

971
01:00:27.344 --> 01:00:31.700
I know it's been a long time
since she passed. but...

972
01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.284
(somber music)

973
01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:45.524
(somber music continues)

974
01:00:45.524 --> 01:00:48.557
(Elijah groans)

975
01:00:48.557 --> 01:00:49.390
Elijah?

976
01:00:51.558 --> 01:00:52.550
What was that?

977
01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:55.938
(Elijah groans)

978
01:00:55.938 --> 01:00:56.771
What is it?

979
01:00:57.709 --> 01:00:58.542
Are you...

980
01:00:58.542 --> 01:01:01.421
(tense music)

981
01:01:01.421 --> 01:01:02.254
Guilty.

982
01:01:03.588 --> 01:01:04.421
Guilty.

983
01:01:06.277 --> 01:01:07.110
Guilty.

984
01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:07.943
Okay.

985
01:01:07.943 --> 01:01:08.776
Guilty.

986
01:01:08.776 --> 01:01:09.610
Okay. You're gonna be fine.

987
01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:10.641
Guilty.
Nurse!

988
01:01:10.641 --> 01:01:12.187
You're gonna be okay. okay?

989
01:01:12.187 --> 01:01:13.306
Guilty.
I'm sorry.

990
01:01:13.306 --> 01:01:14.931
Nurse!

991
01:01:14.931 --> 01:01:15.791
Okay?

992
01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:16.944
You're gonna be fine.

993
01:01:16.944 --> 01:01:18.044
I'm so sorry.
Guilty.

994
01:01:18.044 --> 01:01:19.002
Nurse!

995
01:01:19.002 --> 01:01:21.203
Guilty!

996
01:01:21.203 --> 01:01:22.126
What happened?

997
01:01:23.285 --> 01:01:24.452
It's Elijah.

998
01:01:27.123 --> 01:01:28.674
What's wrong with him?

999
01:01:28.674 --> 01:01:30.534
He was screaming.

1000
01:01:30.534 --> 01:01:31.437
I heard him.

1001
01:01:33.133 --> 01:01:35.222
He seems fine to me.

1002
01:01:35.222 --> 01:01:40.223
(Ava panting)
(ominous music)

1003
01:01:45.017 --> 01:01:48.517
(ominous music continues)

1004
01:01:54.894 --> 01:01:58.395
(ominous music continues)

1005
01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:02.180
(Ava screams)

1006
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.970
(tires squeal)

1007
01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:06.803
(engine rumbling)

1008
01:02:10.246 --> 01:02:14.431
Guys. I just went to see
Elijah. Hannah's brother.

1009
01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:16.709
and he started screaming.
"Guilty. guilty!"

1010
01:02:18.932 --> 01:02:21.733
That's what the Ouija board
was spelling out last night.

1011
01:02:25.448 --> 01:02:28.282
(engine rumbling)

1012
01:02:35.344 --> 01:02:38.261
(foreboding music)

1013
01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:49.179
(foreboding music continues)

1014
01:02:56.077 --> 01:02:58.239
(doorknob rattles)

1015
01:02:58.239 --> 01:03:00.272
He's admitting to guilt.

1016
01:03:00.272 --> 01:03:02.940
(ominous music)

1017
01:03:04.211 --> 01:03:06.044
Ava.

1018
01:03:10.235 --> 01:03:12.848
(eerie music)

1019
01:03:12.848 --> 01:03:15.207
(engine rumbles)

1020
01:03:15.207 --> 01:03:18.290
(police siren wails)

1021
01:03:22.189 --> 01:03:25.106
(foreboding music)

1022
01:03:31.584 --> 01:03:35.335
(foreboding music continues)

1023
01:03:41.368 --> 01:03:42.591
(foreboding music continues)

1024
01:03:42.591 --> 01:03:45.842
(police siren wailing)

1025
01:03:52.591 --> 01:03:56.341
(foreboding music continues)

1026
01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:06.589
(foreboding music continues)

1027
01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:16.683
(foreboding music continues)

1028
01:04:22.864 --> 01:04:26.614
(foreboding music continues)

1029
01:04:32.792 --> 01:04:36.542
(foreboding music continues)

1030
01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.053
(Ava sighs)

1031
01:04:47.455 --> 01:04:49.467
You were weaving all over the lane.

1032
01:04:49.467 --> 01:04:50.487
I know. I'm sorry.

1033
01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:52.201
I just dropped something.

1034
01:04:56.338 --> 01:04:58.799
Cracked windshield. That's a violation.

1035
01:04:58.799 --> 01:05:00.209
Oh. I'm getting it fixed.

1036
01:05:00.209 --> 01:05:03.210
Kellen from in town is working on it.

1037
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:06.933
Good kid. Me and his uncle
went to school together.

1038
01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:11.251
Hm.
(ominous music)

1039
01:05:11.251 --> 01:05:12.851
Are you from the Granger family?

1040
01:05:14.932 --> 01:05:16.562
That's my name.

1041
01:05:16.562 --> 01:05:17.395
Yes. but. I mean.

1042
01:05:17.395 --> 01:05:21.456
are you from the Granger
family. like Hannah Granger?

1043
01:05:24.753 --> 01:05:26.417
Since you're new in town.

1044
01:05:26.417 --> 01:05:29.661
I am just gonna give you a fix-it ticket.

1045
01:05:31.605 --> 01:05:33.692
Have a nice day now.

1046
01:05:33.692 --> 01:05:36.609
(foreboding music)

1047
01:05:43.474 --> 01:05:45.575
(foreboding music continues)

1048
01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:47.908
(Ava sighs)

1049
01:05:55.611 --> 01:05:59.362
(foreboding music continues)

1050
01:06:06.054 --> 01:06:09.805
(foreboding music continues)

1051
01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.790
(foreboding music continues)

1052
01:06:25.944 --> 01:06:29.695
(foreboding music continues)

1053
01:06:35.578 --> 01:06:39.329
(foreboding music continues)

1054
01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:49.770
(foreboding music continues)

1055
01:06:55.293 --> 01:06:56.866
Ava.

1056
01:06:56.866 --> 01:06:58.612
What are you doing here?

1057
01:07:01.067 --> 01:07:02.332
How did you get in?

1058
01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:07.550
I'm not gonna hurt you.
but I know what you did.

1059
01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:09.021
Let's just talk.

1060
01:07:09.021 --> 01:07:11.874
I just wanna talk. I just
wanna talk to you. Ava.

1061
01:07:13.101 --> 01:07:15.916
I downloaded your GPS. Ava.

1062
01:07:15.916 --> 01:07:18.411
(Ava screams)

1063
01:07:18.411 --> 01:07:20.613
(stranger indistinctly speaking)

1064
01:07:20.613 --> 01:07:21.572
(Ava screams)

1065
01:07:21.572 --> 01:07:24.879
(pepper spray hisses)
(stranger groaning)

1066
01:07:24.879 --> 01:07:27.380
(tense music)

1067
01:07:28.321 --> 01:07:33.322
(Ava grunts)
(stranger coughing)

1068
01:07:38.383 --> 01:07:41.826
(tense music continues)

1069
01:07:41.826 --> 01:07:44.409
(somber music)

1070
01:07:47.644 --> 01:07:49.977
(van roars)

1071
01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:59.439
(engine rumbling)

1072
01:08:04.977 --> 01:08:07.020
Hey. hey. hey. Ava!

1073
01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.040
Come to save me again?

1074
01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:08.874
Yeah. Maybe.

1075
01:08:08.874 --> 01:08:09.707
What are you doing exactly?

1076
01:08:09.707 --> 01:08:12.012
A stalker broke into my cabin.

1077
01:08:12.012 --> 01:08:12.845
Ava.

1078
01:08:12.845 --> 01:08:14.993
Oh. you don't believe
me? Maybe the sheriff will!

1079
01:08:14.993 --> 01:08:17.243
Okay. okay. Are you sure
that's what you wanna do?

1080
01:08:17.243 --> 01:08:18.076
What is that supposed to mean?

1081
01:08:18.076 --> 01:08:19.732
I'm not judging. Ava. okay?

1082
01:08:19.732 --> 01:08:23.016
We all make mistakes.
but now I'm involved.

1083
01:08:23.969 --> 01:08:24.900
What are you talking about?

1084
01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.253
All I'm saying is maybe the sheriff

1085
01:08:26.253 --> 01:08:29.524
is not who you need to be
talking to right now. okay?

1086
01:08:29.524 --> 01:08:31.874
Because he's covering
up for Hannah's murder?

1087
01:08:34.445 --> 01:08:35.435
No.

1088
01:08:35.435 --> 01:08:38.826
Because your uncle is best
friends with the sheriff.

1089
01:08:38.826 --> 01:08:41.706
who's a Granger like Hannah Granger?

1090
01:08:41.706 --> 01:08:42.539
You didn't think to tell me that?

1091
01:08:42.539 --> 01:08:44.647
Okay. Ava. this is not about me. okay?

1092
01:08:44.647 --> 01:08:47.199
I found something under your van.

1093
01:08:47.199 --> 01:08:50.279
(ominous music)

1094
01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:51.363
That's him.

1095
01:08:55.384 --> 01:08:56.217
See?

1096
01:08:56.217 --> 01:09:00.071
Okay. listen. I'm gonna
take care of this. Go home.

1097
01:09:00.071 --> 01:09:05.072
(Ava panting)
(ominous music)

1098
01:09:09.161 --> 01:09:10.848
I think we need to
talk to her right now.

1099
01:09:10.848 --> 01:09:12.261
because this is very serious.

1100
01:09:12.261 --> 01:09:13.226
There you are.
Ava.

1101
01:09:13.226 --> 01:09:14.059
Ava.

1102
01:09:14.059 --> 01:09:15.601
Honey. how are you doing?
Get away from me.

1103
01:09:15.601 --> 01:09:16.662
Ava.
Get away from me!

1104
01:09:16.662 --> 01:09:17.970
Ava. we need to get you to the hospital.

1105
01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:19.409
Leave me alone! Stop!

1106
01:09:19.409 --> 01:09:20.815
Honey. we're just trying to help you.

1107
01:09:20.815 --> 01:09:21.773
Can you please talk to me?
No!

1108
01:09:21.773 --> 01:09:23.440
Ava. Ava.

1109
01:09:25.048 --> 01:09:25.943
Don't go!

1110
01:09:25.943 --> 01:09:28.777

1125
01:11:02.028 --> 01:11:03.929
This whole town is against me.

1126
01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.753
Even the sheriff is a Granger!

1127
01:11:09.241 --> 01:11:11.270
I know how Hannah feels.

What. you get off on van girls. huh?

1130

All right. all right. all right. Kellen.

1131
01:11:19.712 --> 01:11:21.788
I think you proved your point.

1132
01:11:21.788 --> 01:11:23.523
(stranger groans)

1133
01:11:23.523 --> 01:11:25.356
This psycho has been stalking Ava.

1134
01:11:27.874 --> 01:11:29.067
Is that true?

1135
01:11:29.067 --> 01:11:30.364
(stranger groans)

1136
01:11:30.364 --> 01:11:32.653
Oh. you're God damn right.

Hands behind your back.

1140
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.531
I think I hear something.

Go home.

1144
01:12:11.422 --> 01:12:12.554
I'll handle this.

1150
01:12:40.726 --> 01:12:42.329
It's just my friend.

1151
01:12:42.329 --> 01:12:44.326
I mean. we can talk now

1152
01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:46.840
or you can wait and be
questioned back at the station.

1153
01:12:49.967 --> 01:12:53.031
I've been tracking that
evil woman for weeks.

1154
01:12:54.558 --> 01:12:55.858
Some kind of freak. huh?

1155
01:12:59.359 --> 01:13:00.862
She killed my daughter.

1156
01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:06.473
Well. that's some accusation.

1157
01:13:09.741 --> 01:13:10.641
You got any proof?

1158
01:13:14.447 --> 01:13:16.195
She's driving around in it.

1159

1185
01:15:27.613 --> 01:15:29.463
Ava. I've called you like 10 times.

1186
01:15:31.904 --> 01:15:33.200
I'm coming over.

1187

She's trying to kill me!

1195

Who?

1196
01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:10.643
Her ghost.

You're just hallucinating.

1206
01:16:39.326 --> 01:16:40.649
Am I hallucinating this?

1207
01:16:41.876 --> 01:16:42.709
What is this?

1208
01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:48.535

What did you do. Ava?

1218
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:48.013
It was him or us.

1219

Who?

1220
01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:55.882

(Jackie chuckles)

1272
01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:08.924
Dad. I think I see them.

1273
01:21:11.831 --> 01:21:14.355
Are you sure? I just got
off the phone with them.

1274
01:21:14.355 --> 01:21:16.034

Hey. Jackie!

1288

Jackie?

1289
01:21:44.379 --> 01:21:45.712
It was a deer.

1290
01:21:46.997 --> 01:21:48.777
It was my daughter. Jackie.

1291
01:21:50.439 --> 01:21:52.022
and you killed her.

1292
01:21:53.416 --> 01:21:55.083

1315
01:23:07.318 --> 01:23:08.527

1317
01:23:10.131 --> 01:23:10.964

(solemn music)

1319
01:23:16.995 --> 01:23:18.632
I just keep looking around.

1320
01:23:18.632 --> 01:23:20.583
Like. I can't believe

1321
01:23:20.583 --> 01:23:23.373
I get to call this little place home.

1322
01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:27.364
and I am so thankful
for you guys. my family.

1323
01:23:27.364 --> 01:23:29.584
to go along on this ride with me.

1324
01:23:29.584 --> 01:23:33.425
So. from now on. don't call me Van Girl.

1325
01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:35.016
Call me Cabin Girl.

1326
01:23:35.016 --> 01:23:37.599
(solemn music)

1327
01:23:39.936 --> 01:23:43.416
It's called peritraumatic dissociation.

1328
01:23:43.416 --> 01:23:45.250
It's rare. but it's real.

1329
01:23:46.447 --> 01:23:48.447
I've never seen anything like it before.

1330
01:23:50.198 --> 01:23:52.098
Will she eventually be okay?

1331
01:23:53.258 --> 01:23:54.548
We'll keep her safe here

1332
01:23:54.548 --> 01:23:57.069
from herself and everyone
else. and we'll determine

1333
01:23:57.069 --> 01:23:59.289
if she can move upstate to stand trial.

1334
01:23:59.289 --> 01:24:02.050
but I don't know if she'll
ever snap out of it.

1335
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:05.530
The physical damage to
her brain has healed.

1336
01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:10.186
but who knows how long she'll
be trapped in this memory?

1337
01:24:10.186 --> 01:24:12.769

1338
