(Music fades)

6
00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.309
Here it is y’all.

7
00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.311
My cousin told me about it.

8
00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.647
Are we really staying here?

9
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.815
I like it. I think it's perfect.

10
00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:09.527
Yeah you say that whenever
a spider's crawling on you.

11
00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.672
Hey guys. let's go swimming.

12
00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:33.259
Some skinny dipping. I’m down.

13
00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.054
About time you sit down.

14
00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:37.764
Come on.

15
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.780
Damn Dean. where'd you get this weed?

16
00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.448
From the dispensary. What do you mean?

17
00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.869
Taste like your dads old diesel weed
we used to steal from back in high school?

18
00:01:58.952 --> 00:01:59.911
No way. man.

19
00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:05.459
I think you're right.

20
00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.544
Must have got this mixed
up with my dad's stash.

21
00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:10.213
He still gets his down at the junkyard.

22
00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:13.341
I would have still
smoked that hillbilly shit.

23
00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:14.551
Hey. sorry theren Kylie.

24
00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:15.469
I'll tell you what though.

25
00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.637
I got some actually
good stuff in the truck.

26
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.972
Stuff that's actually worth smoking.

27
00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:19.806
Sweet!

28
00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:24.561
I swear she smokes 24-7. God.

29
00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.148
Hey. at least it ain't crack.
That's true.

30
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:28.731
You got a good point.

31
00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:31.609
Hey. What are you doing?

32
00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:34.195
Didn't some people get
murdered in these woods?

33
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:35.738
Don't say that.

34
00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.951
That was like 12 years ago though bro.

35
00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.163
Like. the killer's long gone by now.

36
00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.406
What are y’all talking about?

37
00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:47.125
Those people that got
murdered in these woods.

38
00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.294
I'm pretty sure that was Clearwater lake.

39
00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.172
Kylie. you're from Clearwater right?

40
00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:53.715
Yep.

41
00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:56.092
People get wasted there all the time.

42
00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.012
Right before I moved
here last year for college.

43
00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.639
a group of people having a
party got completely butchered.

44
00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.976
It's like the murder
capital of America there.

45
00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.020
All right guys can we
just stop talking about that.

46
00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.897
I don’t see us talking about fake stories

47
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.316
and stuff like that people
getting butchered in the woods.

48
00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.401
Dean. are you getting scared over there?

49
00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.029
What about those guys in Kingstown.

50
00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.114
That shit was crazy as hell.

51
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.406
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.117
Those dudes got wasted
by that hillbilly clown.

53
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.661
Say what? It's a clown?

54
00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:26.113
A night of card games went
south quick for those guys.

55
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.041
“Circus music”

56
00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.926
I’ll raise you everything I got.

57
00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:40.178
Damn it!

58
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.098
Smart move. Daniel Boone.

59
00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.518
Dude. you know he's bluffing.

60
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.103
You know. Andrew can't
lie with a straight face.

61
00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.481
I don’t want to lose all my beans man.

62
00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:52.274
What the hell for?

63
00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.192
Are we playing with
your dinner or something.

64
00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.861
About out of noodles bitch.

65
00:03:57.111 --> 00:03:59.698
Well. I'm not taking your noodles
home. Keith. because he's poor.

66
00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:02.450
But I'm. Not. I don't really
like beans all that much.

67
00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.786
Bro. we're all poor. That's
why we're playing with beans.

68
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.704
Ain’t that the truth?

69
00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.040
Why are we playing cards anyways?

70
00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:10.750
We might as well be doing like

71
00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:13.753
some nerdy shit. like dungeons
and dragons or something?

72
00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:17.215
Wait. why didn't we invite any girls over?

73
00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:18.675
Do you know any girls?

74
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.677
I mean yeah.

75
00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.429
We're not talking about your sister. dude.

76
00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:24.222
Shut the hell up.

77
00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.892
Besides. I know Rachel and Monica.

78
00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.810
And Phoebe? You're just
naming the girls from friends.

79
00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.478
Okay. that's. Just a coincidence.

80
00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.563
(Bang)

81
00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:32.689
What the hell was that?

82
00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:36.442
I think it was ice from airplanes.
they come over here sometimes.

83
00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:39.070
Planes don't fly over Kingstown.

84
00:04:39.153 --> 00:04:40.906
Sure they do. Those big commercial ones.

85
00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.741
They fly like. 30.000 feet.

86
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.451
When have you ever flown?

87
00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.786
I mean. never. but I've seen it on TV.

88
00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:47.787
Oh on friends?

89
00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:48.705
(Bang)

90
00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:51.750
It's probably the neighbor kids.

91
00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.084
Throwing rocks or something.

92
00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.419
At 1 A.M.?

93
00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:02.302
Who is it?

94
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.640
Some hillbilly clown
drunk guy or something?

95
00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.060
Go back to the meth circus you dipshit!

96
00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:15.106
(Bang)

97
00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:17.734
What does this drunk clown want?

98
00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:19.736
Oh. my god.

99
00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:28.077
Sorry mister clown man
my friend was so rude to you.

100
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.037
Don't talk to him.

101
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.665
That’s probably John
Casey’s nephew or something.

102
00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:32.957
You mean John Wayne Gacy?

103
00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:34.042
That’s it.

104
00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:39.714
Sorry sir.

105
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.415
But the clown just wanted
some baked beans. huh?

106
00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.627
Well. I think the beans were just a bonus.

107
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.171
I mean. who doesn’t love good
old fashioned beans and cornbread.

108
00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:23.300
I mean. a pot head like you miss Kylie.

109
00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.759
You’re a pot head too you know.
I mean.

110
00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:27.095
Yeah. but I take breaks during the week.

111
00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:28.513
Is that so?

112
00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:30.974
Yes. that is so.

113
00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.684
Unless it's nighttime.

114
00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:35.812
Okay. so every day kind of like me.
Wrong.

115
00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.398
Every night. maybe. but not every day.

116
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.691
Okay. you got me.

117
00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:40.567
I smoke more than you.

118
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.402
Exactly.

119
00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.905
So Dean you know some
pretty creepy stories. don't you?

120
00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.116
Uh like the time that I walked
in on your mother naked.

121
00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.035
You're so funny man.

122
00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:52.829
Hey man. I'm kidding. I
swear. it was an accident

123
00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:53.788
well stop it.

124
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:55.581
Okay. Okay.

125
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:59.003
I got another weird one for you.
You won't believe it.

126
00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:02.797
Oh. Kylie. I'm sure we won't.
but let's hear it anyways.

127
00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:06.051
It happened one day in a public restroom.

128
00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:08.887
His name is James. and he
loved to take long walks in the park.

129
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.348
I bet he loved to take long shits too huh?

130
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.266
Shut the hell up. Dean.

131
00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:18.729
Anyways. he would go to the park
to get high. walk. and take it all in.

132
00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:23.068
But one day on one of his
walks. he really had to go pee.

133
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.194
And that's when things went south.

134
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.404
For our dude. James.

135
00:07:27.905 --> 00:07:30.032
(Spooky music)

136
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.773
(People talking in the distance)

137
00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:18.581
(Evil growl)

138
00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.790
Nope.

139
00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.501
Don’t go in the bathroom.

140
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.770
(Toilet flush)

141
00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:08.464
(Evil growl)

142
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.262
What the hell are you going to do?

143
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.348
I ain’t scared of no bitch ass ghost.

144
00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:20.393
(Evil whispers)

145
00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:27.149
Man forget that. it’s time to go.

146
00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.946
What the hell!

147
00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:34.740
Okay man.

148
00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:36.451
Calm down. all right.

149
00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:37.827
I must be dreaming.

150
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.454
I knew that stuff wasn’t that strong.

151
00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:42.582
See if I...

152
00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:44.500
God.

153
00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:45.335
Damn!

154
00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.377
Okay

155
00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:49.922
must have been those shrooms that I took.

156
00:09:52.174 --> 00:09:59.348
(Evil whispers)

157
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.944
Damn it. what the hell?

158
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.656
Okay god. please.

159
00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:17.951
I'm sorry for all the bad stuff that I did.

160
00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:19.994
I’m sorry that I put Tommy
in the locker in 3rd grade.

161
00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:22.496
I looked up Mrs Angies skirt.

162
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:28.127
(Evil whispers)

163
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.420
Help!

164
00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:36.927
Help!

165
00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:42.266
(Evil whispers)

166
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.689
(Evil scream)

167
00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:04.830
Thanks for the car James.

168
00:11:05.414 --> 00:11:07.667
(People talking in the distance)

169
00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:13.547
Shit has definitely changed since 92.

170
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:20.054
(Humming a song)

171
00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:34.610
(Evil whispers)

172
00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:36.404
Hello?

173
00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:40.074
Damn ghost.

174
00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:43.327
(Humming a song)

175
00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:49.792
So it took her thirty years
to find her replacement?

176
00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:53.713
No. that was a witch and
enchantress in prisoned by white witch.

177
00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:57.425
I guess she finally figured a
way out with the human sacrifice.

178
00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.760
But now she's free.

179
00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.472
Could be hiding in these
very woods right now.

180
00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:03.155
Wait.

181
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.950
So for the past 30 years.
she's just been sitting there

182
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.394
waiting for some kid to
say her name three times?

183
00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:09.729
Shit. I don't know.

184
00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:13.367
Just wait a minute.
So you're telling me that

185
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.027
a guy who has been
in the mirror till today.

186
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.738
But how did the story even get out?

187
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.448
How does any story get out?

188
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:21.657
Chunk.

189
00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:23.826
Did you just call me Chuck?

190
00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:26.078
No. chunk. Not Chuck.

191
00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.665
You know. how did the
map or the story get out?

192
00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:29.832
From the Goonies.

193
00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:31.208
What's the gooners?

194
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:35.296
You've never seen the Goonies?

195
00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:37.131
Never mind.

196
00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:38.424
It's just a story I was told.

197
00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:40.968
From where I’m from. It
like. doesn't even matter.

198
00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:48.225
This is some good shit.
Dean. What's it called?

199
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:50.853
Ah. nightmare delight.

200
00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:52.188
That's a weird ass name.

201
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:54.232
It's some good shit though. right?

202
00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:55.775
Hell yeah it is.

203
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.611
So. who has a good story?

204
00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:01.238
What? Mine wasn't good?

205
00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:06.619
I mean. like it was. but I want to
hear a good one that's real you know.

206
00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:09.079
Mine was real. I heard it from my. dealer.

207
00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:14.126
Shouldn't you just go to the dispensary
to get your weed like everyone else?

208
00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.087
It's not for weed. babe.

209
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.797
Microdosing shrooms.

210
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.756
Is that even safe?

211
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.299
It's perfectly safe.

212
00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:22.593
Healthy to. And it's great for depression.

213
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:24.887
All right. guys. you want a story?

214
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.681
I got a story for you.
So this is one

215
00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:29.684
that happened a few years before
we had moved into our childhood home.

216
00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:31.978
So I know for sure that this happened.

217
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:35.481
A college girl who hated being by herself.
was stuck housesitting alone one night

218
00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:37.900
when things took a really dark turn.

219
00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:40.444
(Menacing music)

220
00:13:48.702 --> 00:13:52.122
(Evil moan)

221
00:14:05.302 --> 00:14:07.680
(Phone vibrate)

222
00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:10.516
Hello?

223
00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:12.351
Hey. it's Tina.

224
00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.436
Oh. hey babe. What's up?

225
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.522
Uh. I was just wanted to see

226
00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:19.149
if you could possibly come over tonight.

227
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.861
Um. I'm going to be
out pretty late tonight.

228
00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:23.029
We're going to a club 66.

229
00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:24.197
You want to come with us?

230
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.699
Sounds fun. but I can't tonight.

231
00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:32.121
But if you could. I'd really
appreciate it if you just swing by.

232
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:35.458
I hate being by myself.

233
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:38.753
Yeah. I could probably swing by after.

234
00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.338
Are you sure you want to come out. though?

235
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:41.797
It's karaoke night.

236
00:14:42.339 --> 00:14:47.470
I really can't. I'd love to but I'm
housesitting for my parents friend tonight

237
00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:51.307
and they pay me to stay the whole night.

238
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.559
I can't risk getting caught.

239
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.605
But if you decide to leave early tonight.

240
00:14:58.355 --> 00:15:01.567
if you could just please. please stop by.

241
00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:05.155
This house is starting to creep me out.
Okay? Yeah.

242
00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:06.531
I'll try to swing by after.

243
00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.616
It'll probably be after two.

244
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.910
Okay. that's fine.

245
00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:13.370
I'm just right across the
street from my parents house.

246
00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.122
My car is in the driveway.

247
00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:16.791
Okay. sweetie. I'll talk to you soon.

248
00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:18.751
Okay? Bye.

249
00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:41.482
(TV static)

250
00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:59.208
(Evil moan)

251
00:16:09.593 --> 00:16:12.262
Kristen Kristen hey. can you.

254
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.686
Hello. Kristen.

255
00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:22.314
Damn it.

256
00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:36.620
It’s just condensation on the table Tina

257
00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:38.998
it’s not real

258
00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:40.541
just condensation.

259
00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:43.419
(Evil moan)

260
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.297
No no no no!

261
00:16:59.935 --> 00:17:06.609
Hello?
(Evil whispers)

262
00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:14.199
(Evil growl)

263
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.494
(Knock at door)

264
00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:18.120
Tina?

265
00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:22.124
Hey. it's Kristen.

266
00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:26.962
Can I come in?

267
00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:42.770

268
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.981

269
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:47.858
Tina. what's wrong?

270
00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:54.448
(Evil growl)

271
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.244
I believe they're both
still at pineview hospital

272
00:17:58.327 --> 00:17:59.953
still to this day.

273
00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.123
Okay but how do you
know as a shadow person?

274
00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:04.125
I mean. it could have just been
some really good mushrooms.

275
00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:07.002
Well. I mean. they still see
shadows in the house right now.

276
00:18:07.127 --> 00:18:09.171
I mean. the new owners just
kind of learned to live with it.

277
00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:13.926
Sure. maybe I'll see some cool
shit after smoking more of this.

278
00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:15.052
I'm sure you have.

279
00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:16.428
And will.

280
00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.973
I got a really good story to tell.

281
00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.851
I thought you said you
wanted to hear a good story.

282
00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.770
Well this one actually happened bra!

283
00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:25.813

285
00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:31.276
happened at this Oklahoma
small town police department.

286
00:18:31.693 --> 00:18:36.406
They were interrogating somebody and
found some dude with nails in his head.

287
00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:38.284
Oh. shit.
Like pinhead.

288
00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:39.118

289
00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:41.203
Pinhead. from hellraiser.

290
00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:44.415
You watched too many movies.
Anyways.

291
00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:45.875
You said it was at a police station?

292
00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.669
I did.
Oh. shit.

293
00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.171
Andy. your uncle. He's
a police officer. right?

294
00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:51.589
In a small town?

295
00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:53.966
Shit Andy. You have law
enforcement in your family?

296
00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:56.761
Yeah. Kylie but. you
know. weed is legal now.

297
00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:57.928
So we're all good.

298
00:18:58.011 --> 00:19:00.571
Yeah. but shrooms ain’t and I
just told you about my microdosing.

299
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:03.851
My uncle's retired now.
so nothing to worry about.

300
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:05.519
Okay.

301
00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:10.732
Anyways. my uncle saw some
pretty crazy stuff that night.

302
00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:14.253
It all happened when they
brought this girl in for questioning.

303
00:19:16.363 --> 00:19:17.281
(Intense music)

304
00:19:17.364 --> 00:19:18.616
Hey. let me out of here!

305
00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:19.492
I didn't do it!

306
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:20.618
It was a set up man I was framed!

307
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:22.286
Hey quiet! Your father is on his way.

308
00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:23.203
You called my dad?

309
00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:24.997
Just spoke with his father.

310
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.207
He’ll pick him up in the morning.

311
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.457
You mean I got to sleep here?

312
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:29.501
The TV was caught in your hands man.

313
00:19:33.297 --> 00:19:35.924
I guess there's some detectives
here that want to speak with her.

314
00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:39.178
Yeah. they should be in the back.
You can take her to room three.

315
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.470
Alright. Thanks.

316
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:41.805
What’s up girl?

317
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:47.436
Come on. keep moving.

318
00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:02.034
(Music fades)

319
00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:10.459
Turn around. Face this way.

320
00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:13.545
I’m going to take these
hand cuffs off okay.

321
00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:25.724
(Soft music)

322
00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.852
If you’ll have a seat right there.

323
00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:30.437
The detectives will be in
here in just a moment okay.

324
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.069
Any word on that search warrant?

325
00:20:37.152 --> 00:20:38.445
They have a rush on it.

326
00:20:38.528 --> 00:20:41.782
We should know something within the hour.

327
00:20:41.865 --> 00:20:42.575
Okay.

328
00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.781

00:20:44.864 --> 00:20:47.204

334
00:21:20.737 --> 00:21:23.032

And where did you hear about this?

360
00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:58.251
The news I guess.

361
00:22:58.543 --> 00:23:00.712
So. You knew how brutal his death was?

362
00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:02.715
Not really.

363
00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:04.674
I just heard about it.

364
00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:07.303
Did you ever meet Andrew?

365
00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:08.261
No.

366
00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:15.310
Were you ever at Andrew's house?

367
00:23:15.685 --> 00:23:17.896
No. I said I never met him.

368
00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:24.444
Do you think you might have met
Andrew and just not remember it?

369
00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:28.782
Do I look stupid to you?

370
00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:31.451
There's no need to get
defensive miss white.

371
00:23:32.285 --> 00:23:34.246
Andrew was brutally murdered.

372
00:23:34.329 --> 00:23:37.249
And we just want you to have
the chance to clear your name.

373
00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:41.837
I'm just tired of answering
all these questions.

374
00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:44.506
I told the cops this like an hour ago.

375
00:23:45.173 --> 00:23:46.216
All right.

376
00:23:46.883 --> 00:23:50.470
Tell us everything you
know about Mr. Blake.

377
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:57.018
All we know about this guy is
that he was one of those red dots

378
00:23:57.269 --> 00:24:00.021
on the sex offender registry website.

379
00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:03.692
How do you know that?

380
00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:05.610
The news.

381
00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:09.322
You don't like sex
offenders very much do you?

382
00:24:10.198 --> 00:24:11.366
No I don’t.

383
00:24:12.075 --> 00:24:13.118
Do you?

384
00:24:15.412 --> 00:24:18.332
Miss white. we put scumbags like that away.

385
00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:19.749
Hum?

386
00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:23.128
So what are you saying miss white?

387
00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:25.255
You glad he's dead?

388
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.965
I'm not upset.

389
00:24:28.842 --> 00:24:30.677
You knew Andrew miss white.

390
00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:33.763
Your prints were at his
house where he was murdered.

391
00:24:33.847 --> 00:24:34.765
Is that so?

392
00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:35.891
Yes. it is.

393
00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:39.227
He was riddled with nails in his face.

394
00:24:39.978 --> 00:24:41.605
What a shame.

395
00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:44.816
We never found the nail gun at his house.

396
00:24:45.942 --> 00:24:47.277
Only your prints.

397
00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:49.488
Just tell us the truth.

398
00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:52.825
So you guys think I put

399
00:24:52.908 --> 00:24:55.494
12 nails in some guy's face?

400
00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:57.830
How did you know it was 12?

401
00:24:57.913 --> 00:24:59.123
Wild guess.

402
00:24:59.206 --> 00:25:01.416
Maybe I heard on the news.

403
00:25:03.793 --> 00:25:05.795
If you'll excuse us for just a bit.

404
00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:07.547
Miss white.

405
00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:26.984
Any word on the search?

406
00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:28.193
They didn't find anything.

407
00:25:28.276 --> 00:25:29.945
You two were going to
have to get a confession.

408
00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:31.822
You sure we got the right person?

409
00:25:31.905 --> 00:25:33.407
Of course we do.

410
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.451
I mean. that little girl

411
00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:36.993
can do that much damage?

412
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.792
Her prints were all over the scene.

413
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:45.919
Do we have any other leads?

414
00:25:46.002 --> 00:25:48.004
My guys didn't find anything.

415
00:25:49.172 --> 00:25:50.966
No other possible accomplice?

416
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:53.677
Not to our. our knowledge.

417
00:25:55.345 --> 00:25:56.054
Well good work.

418
00:25:56.137 --> 00:25:57.014
Keep it. Keep it up.

419
00:25:57.097 --> 00:26:00.308
We'll get back in here and see if
we can get a confession out of her.

420
00:26:00.517 --> 00:26:01.309
Yes sir.

421
00:26:06.606 --> 00:26:08.024
We searched your house miss white.

422
00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:09.192
What?

423
00:26:09.484 --> 00:26:10.736
We had a search warrant.

424
00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:12.737
As soon as your prints came up.

425
00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:14.656
You went through my house?

426
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:15.574
Yes.

427
00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:19.369
Where did you stash the nail gun?

428
00:26:19.786 --> 00:26:21.705
I don't own a nail gun.

429
00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:25.000
Where did you stash
Mr. Blake’s nail gun miss white?

430
00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:26.334
I'm not a thief.

431
00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:28.503
But you are a killer.

432
00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:33.550
What we did find at your house was
a printout of registered sex offenders

433
00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:39.097
in which two are missing and one is
dead with your prints all over his house.

434
00:26:40.223 --> 00:26:42.309
You're going down for this. Allison.

435
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:46.313
Just tell us where you
stashed the nail gun.

436
00:26:46.396 --> 00:26:48.440
I don't need a nail gun.

437
00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:50.817
So what did you use?

438
00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:54.195
Maybe he fell into a bucket of nails.

439
00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:55.531
Now you're being ridiculous.

440
00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:56.698
You're being ridiculous.

441
00:26:56.781 --> 00:27:00.577
Suggesting I used a nail gun. I
don't even know how to use a nail gun.

442
00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:02.871
Then what did you use miss white?

443
00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:06.333
I think I'll take my lawyer now. I'm done.

444
00:27:06.416 --> 00:27:08.085
You need to answer the question.

445
00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:09.961
I need my lawyer.

446
00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:12.631
You'll get a lawyer at trial.

447
00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.507
Get me my lawyer.

448
00:27:15.216 --> 00:27:16.760
Answer the question.

449
00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:18.178
Get my lawyer.

450
00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:22.057
Why did you kill him?

451
00:27:24.392 --> 00:27:26.645
Get my lawyer now.

452
00:27:29.564 --> 00:27:31.483
You'll get a lawyer.

453
00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:36.238
You'll need a lawyer.

454
00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:37.697
Detective Riley.

455
00:27:39.282 --> 00:27:40.200
2010

456
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:42.994
that young girl with marijuana.

457
00:27:45.872 --> 00:27:47.958
I have arrested lots
of girls with marijuana.

458
00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:49.209
No

459
00:27:49.292 --> 00:27:51.252
No this one you let go.

460
00:27:53.546 --> 00:27:58.302
This isn't about who I've arrested
or who I haven’t or who I've let go.

461
00:27:58.385 --> 00:27:59.303
This is about you.

462
00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:01.388
She was barely 17.

463
00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:06.267
And detective mills here know better.

464
00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:09.771
How many dirty detectives
have you covered up for?

465
00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:11.732
Listen here young lady!

466
00:28:11.815 --> 00:28:13.650
I'm not going to put up with your...

467
00:28:13.733 --> 00:28:16.361
Hey. calm down a second. calm down.

468
00:28:16.444 --> 00:28:18.697
She knows she's in a lot of trouble.

469
00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:23.743
Your mother was a criminal. too wasn't she?

470
00:28:24.994 --> 00:28:25.829
Shut up.

471
00:28:26.663 --> 00:28:30.167
She was in and out of
mental hospitals and jail

472
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.418
all your life.

473
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:34.504
She even earned a lot
of money on the streets

474
00:28:34.587 --> 00:28:35.547
when she could.

475
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:36.923
Shut up!

476
00:28:40.301 --> 00:28:41.803
Crazy lady.

477
00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:44.056
apple doesn't fall far
from the tree does it?

478
00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:45.640
I said. shut up.

479
00:28:47.475 --> 00:28:48.060
I -

480
00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:50.270
I see you're angry miss white.

481
00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:54.190
Leave my mother out of this.

482
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.235
Then just tell us the truth.

483
00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:01.239
About what? Your friend.

484
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.617
The truth about Andrew Blake.

485
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:04.576
Yeah.

486
00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:06.078
your friend.

487
00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:07.495
Right?

488
00:29:08.705 --> 00:29:10.457
Yes. he was my friend.

489
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:14.085
Andrew made lots of
mistakes. but he was my friend.

490
00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:16.338
Now just tell us the truth.

491
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:17.589
Why did you kill him?

492
00:29:17.672 --> 00:29:20.175
You both made a lot of mistakes.

493
00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:23.178
What is she talking about?

494
00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:26.473
Are you going to cover up for him too?

495
00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:29.225
Riley?

496
00:29:30.018 --> 00:29:31.352
You knew Mr. Blake?

497
00:29:32.562 --> 00:29:33.522
Don't listen to her.

498
00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:35.023
She's a murderer.

499
00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:36.816
They have a past together.

500
00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:39.194
Blake and Riley enterprises.

501
00:29:39.652 --> 00:29:41.071
that’s what they
wanted to call their little

502
00:29:41.154 --> 00:29:41.946
sex empire.

503
00:29:43.239 --> 00:29:44.199
Shut up.

504
00:29:45.074 --> 00:29:46.243
Don't listen to her. mills.

505
00:29:46.326 --> 00:29:48.495
She's just trying to get in your head.

506
00:29:50.747 --> 00:29:51.915
So how did you do it?

507
00:29:51.998 --> 00:29:53.208
How did you kill him?

508
00:29:56.836 --> 00:29:57.921
Like this.

509
00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:00.548
(Intense music)

510
00:30:14.395 --> 00:30:16.231
Alison. wait!

511
00:30:27.367 --> 00:30:29.744
What did they say
happened to the detectives?

512
00:30:30.787 --> 00:30:32.580
I don't know just a cover up.

513
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:35.500
But did y’all hear about the
couple that went stargazing?

514
00:30:35.917 --> 00:30:38.044
Yeah. I think I heard
about that on the news.

515
00:30:38.586 --> 00:30:41.214
Or is that TV show. strange
sightings of the supernatural?

516
00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:42.549
Probably both.

517
00:30:42.882 --> 00:30:46.719
There were some strange sightings
and lights and a man in a black suit

518
00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:50.306
seemed out of place that
night they disappeared.

519
00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:55.186
Wow! That's so amazing.

520
00:30:55.937 --> 00:30:57.314
It's just a plane.

521
00:30:57.397 --> 00:30:58.064
(Sci-Fi music)

522
00:30:58.147 --> 00:30:59.900
No. no. it's not.

523
00:30:59.983 --> 00:31:00.942
It's.

524
00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:02.986
It's kind of yellow and

525
00:31:03.987 --> 00:31:05.864
there's no blinking lights.

526
00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:08.283
Oh. wow.

527
00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:09.659
Amanda. check it out.

528
00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:12.620
Take me home.

529
00:31:13.288 --> 00:31:14.372
Take you home?

530
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:16.124
What time is it?

531
00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:20.461
It's ten after 11. Why?

532
00:31:21.963 --> 00:31:26.384
You know. I always wanted to see a UFO. but

533
00:31:27.135 --> 00:31:29.387
I never thought I'd
actually get to see one.

534
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.598
Come on. let's go.

535
00:31:32.473 --> 00:31:34.601
It's fine Amanda. it’s gone.

536
00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:36.519
It. can't hurt you now.

537
00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.279
Are you okay?

538
00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:49.032
Take me home now Brandon.

539
00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:50.575
What time?

540
00:31:50.658 --> 00:31:52.452
What time did you say it was again?

541
00:31:52.535 --> 00:31:53.870
I told you. it's

542
00:31:54.787 --> 00:31:56.581
1 o’clock?

543
00:31:57.457 --> 00:31:59.542
And how long have we been walking?

544
00:32:00.126 --> 00:32:01.628
20 minutes.

545
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.130
How is it 1 o’clock then?

546
00:32:04.213 --> 00:32:04.881
I don't know.

547
00:32:04.964 --> 00:32:06.424
It's just 11.

548
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.552
Ah. you must have looked at it wrong.

549
00:32:10.094 --> 00:32:11.972
Take me home now. Brandon.

550
00:32:12.055 --> 00:32:13.558
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Please.

551
00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:14.807
Sorry. Come on.

552
00:32:42.335 --> 00:32:44.545
So we really lost 2 hours. huh?

553
00:32:44.921 --> 00:32:46.121
I don't want to talk about it.

554
00:32:47.674 --> 00:32:50.468
But Amanda. something happened.

555
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.262
Please. just take me home.

556
00:32:53.763 --> 00:32:55.181
Okay? Alright I’m sorry.

557
00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:00.645
(Intense music)

558
00:33:05.441 --> 00:33:06.693
What is it?

559
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:11.364
Start the car Brandon.

560
00:33:12.949 --> 00:33:15.201
Brandon! Start the car.

561
00:33:26.087 --> 00:33:26.922
Just drive.

562
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:27.964
Go around him.

563
00:33:29.924 --> 00:33:32.176
You've heard about the men in black right?

564
00:33:32.552 --> 00:33:33.303
What!

565
00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:35.138
Brandon. just drive!

566
00:33:40.476 --> 00:33:42.103
I think that's one of them.

567
00:33:42.562 --> 00:33:43.938
One of who?

568
00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:45.565
(Soft music)

569
00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:47.859
The men in black.

570
00:33:51.237 --> 00:33:53.740
What?
Like the will Smith movie?

571
00:33:56.409 --> 00:33:59.078
Yes. but no.

572
00:34:00.246 --> 00:34:01.873
they're not funny

573
00:34:02.582 --> 00:34:04.083
or kind

574
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.044
or help people.

575
00:34:06.627 --> 00:34:08.129
What do you mean?

576
00:34:08.755 --> 00:34:10.089
What I mean. is

577
00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:13.301
that more sinister.

578
00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:14.218
What?

579
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:16.554
They work for

580
00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:18.473
them.

581
00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:20.475
Who?

582
00:34:21.642 --> 00:34:23.019
They're not from here.

583
00:34:23.978 --> 00:34:27.857
They're more like interdimensional beings.

584
00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:31.277
Those documentaries are fake.

585
00:34:31.944 --> 00:34:33.404
You think so?

586
00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:36.074
The strange light and the creepy mob guy

587
00:34:36.157 --> 00:34:37.867
was just a coincidence.

588
00:34:39.202 --> 00:34:40.203
Amanda

589
00:34:40.286 --> 00:34:43.414
what would a mob guy be
doing in the park woods?

590
00:34:43.706 --> 00:34:44.624
I don’t know Brandon.

591
00:34:44.707 --> 00:34:46.501
Probably burying a body.

592
00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:49.420
What else do mob bosses do in wooded areas?

593
00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:56.594
Drive Brandon!

594
00:34:57.804 --> 00:34:58.972
Brandon. go around him.

595
00:34:59.055 --> 00:35:00.473
Let's go!

596
00:35:09.315 --> 00:35:11.234
It's not the same guy?

597
00:35:11.859 --> 00:35:13.069
I told you.

598
00:35:13.152 --> 00:35:14.362
That's one of them.

599
00:35:15.988 --> 00:35:17.073
Okay here's the road.

600
00:35:17.156 --> 00:35:18.658
My house is right down the street.

601
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.502
What the hell is going on here?

602
00:35:30.586 --> 00:35:32.296
I tried to tell you.

603
00:35:33.005 --> 00:35:34.715
I'm calling my mom.

604
00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:37.760
It's 3 o’clock Brandon.

605
00:35:39.095 --> 00:35:39.929
I know.

606
00:35:40.012 --> 00:35:43.016
It’s 3 o’clock in the
freaking morning Brandon.

607
00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:44.142
3 o’clock!

608
00:35:44.225 --> 00:35:46.144
I tried to tell you. but you don't!

609
00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:51.315
Yes. Brandon. I know you tried to tell me.

610
00:35:52.024 --> 00:35:53.901
Don't you think I know that

611
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.323
we just freaking teleported
from my house back here?

612
00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:01.075
And you want to say I told you so?

613
00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:04.871
I assure you. I realize

614
00:36:04.954 --> 00:36:07.290
all of this is freaking happening.

615
00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:12.420
You know what. Amanda?

616
00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:13.629
You're right.

617
00:36:14.797 --> 00:36:16.174
I'm sorry.

618
00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:18.593
I'm really.

619
00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:20.261
really sorry.

620
00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:21.888
Come here. come here.

621
00:36:23.306 --> 00:36:24.546
It's going to be okay. Alright.

622
00:36:25.474 --> 00:36:26.809
Going to be okay.

623
00:36:27.226 --> 00:36:28.978
Breathe.

624
00:36:31.939 --> 00:36:33.274
It’s going to be okay.

625
00:36:38.529 --> 00:36:41.157
(Intense music)

626
00:36:41.782 --> 00:36:42.575
Go. go. go.

627
00:36:42.658 --> 00:36:44.076
Let's go now.

628
00:36:45.161 --> 00:36:46.329
Brandon what are you doing?

629
00:36:46.412 --> 00:36:47.496
Let's go!

630
00:36:49.498 --> 00:36:52.752
Brandon what are you doing?

631
00:36:55.755 --> 00:36:57.215
Where are you going?

632
00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:01.510
Oh. my god. Oh my god Brandon.

633
00:37:01.594 --> 00:37:03.804
What are you doing?

634
00:37:37.713 --> 00:37:40.716
Brandon. are you okay?

635
00:37:46.055 --> 00:37:47.348
What happened?

636
00:37:47.723 --> 00:37:50.142
Some x-file shit.

637
00:37:55.982 --> 00:37:57.942
I'm supposed to take you somewhere.

638
00:37:58.025 --> 00:38:00.236
No. just take me home.

639
00:38:01.153 --> 00:38:02.655
No. I feel like

640
00:38:02.738 --> 00:38:04.532
I'm supposed to take you someplace.

641
00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:10.454
No. Brandon. I have nothing going on today.

642
00:38:11.247 --> 00:38:12.915
I just want to sleep.

643
00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:14.917
Okay?

644
00:38:27.763 --> 00:38:30.099
(Heavy metal music)

645
00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:39.608
(Scream!)

646
00:39:17.646 --> 00:39:20.733
Hey! Hey you!

647
00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:24.320
What the hell are you doing on my property!

648
00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:42.588
Wait. so what happened to Brandon?
- I don't know.

649
00:39:42.671 --> 00:39:46.634
I guess they just moved on found a
new girlfriend and they just let him go

650
00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:48.469
after they couldn't find no evidence

651
00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:50.262
no body. No. nothing.

652
00:39:50.513 --> 00:39:52.265
But shit like this doesn't
happen in real life.

653
00:39:52.348 --> 00:39:54.767
Yeah and people really didn’t
get murdered in these woods.

654
00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:56.853
Told you dudes. that was Clearwater lake.

655
00:39:56.936 --> 00:39:59.355
I mean. supernatural powers and stuff.

656
00:39:59.438 --> 00:40:01.566
Aliens it. it just doesn't exist.

657
00:40:01.649 --> 00:40:02.400
You never know Dean.

658
00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:04.569
Stranger things have happened
to more average people.

659
00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:06.029
Sure and I'm average

660
00:40:06.112 --> 00:40:07.363
I'm going to take an average piss.

661
00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:08.948
Maybe something weird will happen.

662
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.410
Oh! Awe! Ow!

663
00:40:16.997 --> 00:40:18.750
Damn. that was weird.

664
00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:20.393
What are you doing Kylie. you’re crazy!

665
00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:23.629
Ohh! Ow!!

666
00:40:31.387 --> 00:40:34.140
I guess the murder did
happen in these woods.

667
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:43.024
(Evil scream)

668
00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:45.568
(Heavy metal music)

669
00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:47.880
(Music fades out)
