00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.133
- You're serious.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.510
It was a no? On all these designs?

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.990
- Arabella. between us.

6
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.860
you were never truly in the
competition for this job.

7
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.093
- But you. you showed
them all of these. right?

8
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.540
And it was still a no?

9
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.330
This industry isn't giving me anything.

10
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.240
I can't even buy a meal these days.

11
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.167
It's taken everything from me.

12
00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.290
My time. my friends.
my money. and for what?

13
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.990
- Listen. Arabella. honestly.

14
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.990
I do think it will turn around.

15
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.540
However. have you looked
at other office jobs

16
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.856
that need designers?

17
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.720
- I mean. kill me now.

18
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.920
I couldn't work for a designer. Ian.

19
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.143
It would destroy me.

20
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.450
- Take a look at this.

21
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.723
- Personal shopper?

22
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.410
- A lot of my designers tend to look

23
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.400
at different sideline jobs.

24
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.340
It's a good way to earn some money.

25
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.970
plus it's an easy job. too.

26
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.593
How about you go to this meeting.

27
00:01:08.643 --> 00:01:09.452
It could see you over

28
00:01:09.476 --> 00:01:10.920
until we make something happen.

29
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.500
Before I tell you my story.

30
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.010
I suppose you need to know my truth.

31
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.210
Truth is I have always
been a bit different.

32
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.440
I never knew how or what it was

33
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.560
that set me apart from the other girls.

34
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.100
I felt like I grew up so fast.

35
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.360
I felt like I was missing

36
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.820
out on all those big life experiences.

37
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.770
- Arabella Childs?

38
00:01:43.214 --> 00:01:44.047
You're up.

39
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.443
- I didn't know what in my
life I was craving so badly.

40
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.577
not until I had that meeting.

41
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.191
nothing more than you keep

42
00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:23.681
you don't want to be

43
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:26.570
you won't even show me

44
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.324
heart of heaven and hell

45
00:02:31.374 --> 00:02:33.882
you don't know can heal

46
00:02:33.932 --> 00:02:36.623
you fight fear to kill

47
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.860
I'm Arabella.

48
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.070
- I know.

49
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.260
- I studied at St. Franks
College of Fashion.

50
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.340
graduating last year.

51
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.110
I've been working on my own fashion line.

52
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.910
- I don't want to see your designs.

53
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.860
So fashion designer is
what you want to be?

54
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.113
- Yeah. That's the main goal.

55
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.793
- Well. why are you here?

56
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.810
I mean. everybody else
in that waiting room

57
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.673
actually wants this as a profession.

58
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.293
- Because fashion is all I know.

59
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.890
Because I know I can do just as good job

60
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.396
as anyone sitting in that
waiting room out there.

61
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.433
- Your parents.

62
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.783
What do they make of this life choice?

63
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.763
- They're um...

64
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.080
Well. they died when I was younger. so...

65
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.240
- Well. I have my new novel coming out

66
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.070
in the next few months and
I need somebody to dress me

67
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.380
for every single publicity occasion.

68
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.393
So how are you of taking orders?

69
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.090
- I'm more than capable of taking orders.

70
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.280
Marylin had a way of making me feel small.

71
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.480
feeling worthless in just seconds.

72
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.493
It was a weird power she had over me.

73
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:17.240
It was like she scooped me up

74
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.543
and squished me to the ground. like a bug.

75
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.443
Little did I know Marylin
would unleash the real me.

76
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.810
Whether you agree with my
actions of my story or not.

77
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.623
it is the girl that was within me.

78
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.340
- So I've been working in the
city now for like two years.

79
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.700
and um. I'm moving on
up at quite a good pace.

80
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.690
Yeah.

81
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.360
I've got my flat. which is just mine.

82
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.653
Go on about two holidays a year.

83
00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:04.450
I'd be far.

84
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.711
- Looks like everything's
going great for you. then.

85
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:07.730
- Yeah.

86
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.930
Yeah. it's going great.

87
00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:13.626
All I need now is the arm candy.

88
00:06:13.676 --> 00:06:14.509
- Arm candy?

89
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.827
- Yeah. you know. the old
missus I can call my very own.

90
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.506
Lovely. where are you?

91
00:06:24.556 --> 00:06:26.756
That's my
flatmate. One second.

92
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.403
Saf. the plumber's here.

93
00:06:29.427 --> 00:06:31.253
- What. the tap's not fixed yet?

94
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.130
- Getting there.

95
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.240
- Is he hot?

96
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.960
- His personality is as vibrant
as a hippopotamus's asshole.

97
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.513
- Yeah. but like. is he hot. though?

98
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.046
- Yeah.

99
00:06:44.096 --> 00:06:45.600
- Oh my god.

100
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.100
We have such similar minds.
you know that. right?

101
00:06:50.103 --> 00:06:50.953
- You dirty girl.

102
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.328
- Is that him?

103
00:06:53.378 --> 00:06:54.211
Oh my god.

104
00:06:57.997 --> 00:06:58.830
Hey.

105
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.183
- Oh. hey.

106
00:07:02.698 --> 00:07:04.082
Well I think that is it.

107
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.530
I'm Markus. by the way.

108
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.770
- Plumber.

109
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.170
Yeah. Well I live here. so...

110
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.610
We have a problem in the bedroom.

111
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.970
- Yeah? What's the problem?

112
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.113
- Yeah. It's the taps are
dripping in the bedroom.

113
00:07:20.163 --> 00:07:22.403
Will you check it out? Please?

114
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.563
- Show me your taps.

115
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.400
My flatmate
Saffie was a wild one.

116
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.000
I think she was the first girl who

117
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.630
tried releasing the inner girl I talk of.

118
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.743
However. she never truly held the key.

119
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.753
She just made me aware.

120
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.263
It was something inside
itching to be released.

121
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.851
you mine if you want

122
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:12.579
go when you're gone

123
00:08:15.383 --> 00:08:19.181
quarter all if you want

124
00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:24.231
know what you want now

125
00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:32.082
Hello?

126
00:08:32.132 --> 00:08:33.620
Miss Childs?

127
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.103
- Yeah. who is speaking?

128
00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:37.763
Marylin-Blacklock
Charterhouse.

129
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.560
You interviewed for the
personal shopper job yesterday?

130
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.970
- Oh uh. yes. I did. Yeah.

131
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.260
You start tomorrow.

132
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.326
I have an event tomorrow night

133
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.280
so I will need a selection of dresses.

134
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.240
Have some for me to choose
from tomorrow midday. yeah?

135
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.270
- Yeah. that's absolutely fine.

136
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.745
Okay. see you tomorrow.

137
00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:55.878
Ciao for now.

138
00:08:57.105 --> 00:09:00.605
- What the hell?

139
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.560
Hi.

140
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.853
I'm Arabella.

141
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.570
- Oh. yeah.

142
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.833
Personal shopper.

143
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.623
I'm Ross. her husband.

144
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.230
- Uh. where's the bedroom?

145
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.563
To put the gowns.

146
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.920
- Top of the stairs.
last door on the right.

147
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.460
Join me for a coffee after?

148
00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.293
- Sure.

149
00:09:59.343 --> 00:10:01.103
There was something about her husband.

150
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.560
He had cheat written all over his face.

151
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.853
No wonder she had this power trip over me.

152
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.950
She probably wanted her own form

153
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.583
of release from this nightmare.

154
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.840
- It was just getting cold.

155
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.010
So what's the deal then?

156
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.620
You're here for how long?

157
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.560
- Well. my contract said three weeks.

158
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.690
but it could be continuous.

159
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.549
- Oh. that woman does know how

160
00:10:51.573 --> 00:10:53.390
to blow her cash. doesn't she?

161
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.260
Well. for that. I should say my cash.

162
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.330
- It can be hard when you have an event

163
00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.570
to find the right clothing.

164
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.520
- Yeah. or just pure fucking laziness.

165
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.900
- I'm styling what she
wears for her interviews.

166
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:06.850
For her new novel.

167
00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:09.890
- Have you read the other one?

168
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:17.343
- Hm. good morning. Arabella.

169
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.673
Ross.

170
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.543
You're here.

171
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.593
- I am.

172
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.720
- I thought you were working.

173
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.970
- Scared I'd see the new habit. huh?

174
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.600
Wasting the cash on
someone buying your gowns?

175
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.483
- Hmm.

176
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.070
- Lost something. dear?

177
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.830
- I'm just looking for my manuscript

178
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.003
to give to my publisher for my-

179
00:11:43.027 --> 00:11:46.243
- "His fingers slipped
like butter inside me.

180
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.120
It was like my whole body welcomed him.

181
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.840
eager for his touch.

182
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.700
It wasn't like my husband's touch.

183
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:53.910
It was more.

184
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.920
My husband didn't know-"

185
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.717
- Why are you reading that?

186
00:11:56.767 --> 00:11:59.060
- "It wasn't just his touch I desired.

187
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.890
No. it was the need to feel wanted.

188
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.749
to feel important instead of
how my husband treated me."

189
00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:07.950
- It's fucking personal.

190
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.820
- So personal that you're
going to publish it

191
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.093
to be read by millions?

192
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.396
It feels a little bit close to home

193
00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.130
from what I've been reading.

194
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.703
- Arabella. ignore my husband.

195
00:12:30.569 --> 00:12:32.736
Marylin. a word.

196
00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:43.576
Why do you have
to embarrass me like that?

197
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.606
Why?
- Now listen. now look.

198
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.876
I know you like to act like a big shot

199
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.049
in front of your friends. all right.

200
00:12:47.073 --> 00:12:47.882
but you do not talk to me-
- What have I done

201
00:12:47.906 --> 00:12:49.611
to upset you?
- Like that in this house!

202
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:50.470
You don't talk

203
00:12:50.494 --> 00:12:51.303
to me like that!
- This is my house.

204
00:12:51.327 --> 00:12:52.136
you don't bring a penny

205
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.969
into this house.
- You're a fucking cunt!

206
00:12:52.993 --> 00:12:54.176
- No. you do not bring
a penny into this house!

207
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.370
- Is everything okay?

208
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.820
It's fine. yeah.

209
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.250
- If there's anything I can do. I'm here.

210
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.393
and not just as a personal shopper.

211
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.200
- I said. yeah. I said everything is fine.

212
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.750
- It doesn't look fine.

213
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.600
- We've all got our problems. right?

214
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.923
Hello?

215
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.313
Oh hi. yeah.

216
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:46.180
Okay. great. Yeah. yeah.

217
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.050
I'll be on my way. okay?

218
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:48.909
All right. Thanks a lot.

219
00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:50.080
Thank you. all right. Bye.

220
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.520
My publisher has some notes for me.

221
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.880
so I've got to go. okay?

222
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.280
- I can iron the gowns.

223
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.190
I may have to leave. though.

224
00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.636
- Yeah. that's fine.
that's understandable.

225
00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.910
Just lock up when you go.

226
00:14:02.838 --> 00:14:04.248
There was
something about Marylin

227
00:14:04.272 --> 00:14:06.222
that had awoken something inside of me.

228
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.320
It was like that yearning
for the mother figure

229
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.453
that I'd never had.

230
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.173
or was it the I enjoyed
being put in my place?

231
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.410
Surely not.

232
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.810
I mean. in my career. it was all about

233
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.413
finding the control. ensuring
people listened to me.

234
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.720
But something about Marylin.

235
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.160
the way she looked at me.
the way she tore me apart

236
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.723
within seconds with her
look. it turned me on.

237
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.073
I know it's messed up.

238
00:14:39.071 --> 00:14:41.003
and I can't even begin to explain why.

239
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.570
I own you.

240
00:14:53.703 --> 00:14:55.370
You are so below me.

241
00:14:57.892 --> 00:14:58.725
So...

242
00:15:09.844 --> 00:15:12.290
This is where everything takes a turn.

243
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.383
Don't judge me on what I do next.

244
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.140
Just understand that my
actions were being controlled.

245
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.393
in a way puppeteered by an
unknown force within me.

246
00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:24.625
Take off your top.

247
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.773
Unbutton your top.

248
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.253
- Okay.

249
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:43.923
- Now!

250
00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:10.380
Get on the ground.

251
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.287
Like a dog on all fours.

252
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.697
Dance. little puppy.

253
00:18:34.815 --> 00:18:35.648
Get up.

254
00:18:38.163 --> 00:18:38.996
Get up.

255
00:18:50.873 --> 00:18:53.572
- You're a crazy bitch. aren't you?

256
00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.813
- So like. how the hell
did you manage to get

257
00:19:24.837 --> 00:19:26.575
yourself out of that situation?

258
00:19:26.625 --> 00:19:27.636
- I had to wait for her
to get out the shower

259
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.140
and then I snuck out.

260
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.400
- Oh my god. girl. that's
like super risky. right.

261
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:34.874
you know that?

262
00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:36.720
- I can't believe I did it.

263
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.940
I didn't plan for it.
but he is so unfaithful.

264
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.350
He slapped her before I left.

265
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.440
- All guys are unfaithful.

266
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.218
but everyone's entitled to
their own opinion. yeah?

267
00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:49.335
Look. I want to know when are
you going to go peepin' again?

268
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:53.760
- Oh my god.

269
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.043
You're going to go. aren't you?

270
00:19:55.067 --> 00:19:56.183
You're gonna do it again. aren't you?

271
00:19:56.207 --> 00:20:00.207
Dirty little girl you are.
- Oh. shut up. Saffie.

272
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:09.933
I couldn't help it.

273
00:20:11.111 --> 00:20:14.250
I'd go back there and wait
for her to return home.

274
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:19.300
Some days it would never
happen. others. it would.

275
00:20:20.824 --> 00:20:22.657
and it was incredible.

276
00:21:10.977 --> 00:21:14.006
- So how's it going then.
with my madam's clothing?

277
00:21:14.056 --> 00:21:15.929
- Well. I think.

278
00:21:15.979 --> 00:21:18.828
She seems to be enjoying
what she's wearing.

279
00:21:18.878 --> 00:21:19.711
- Great.

280
00:21:22.138 --> 00:21:24.200
You know. she should be here by now.

281
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.593
Must be exhausted from her heavy workload.

282
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.683
- She must.

283
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.280
You know. I watched this program yesterday

284
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.820
about how relationships can break.

285
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.270
- An uplifting thing to watch.

286
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.430
- What was interesting was

287
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.910
those who control the relationship

288
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.670
always lose the control at some point.

289
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.104
always become the one who is lower.

290
00:21:51.154 --> 00:21:53.090
- Is that right?
- It is.

291
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.880
They say that if you are weak enough

292
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.660
to control your partner.
the other will always

293
00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.813
find strength to react. a
confidence to leave the other.

294
00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.400
- Arabella. I loved the dress you bought

295
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.800
for last night's event.

296
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.729
- What sort of event was it. Marylin?

297
00:22:09.779 --> 00:22:11.279
- It was a quiet get together.

298
00:22:16.766 --> 00:22:19.130
There was
something that excited me.

299
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.833
the fact that I knew what
she was really talking about.

300
00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:24.060
that I knew the truth.

301
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.800
I had one up on her even
though she held the key.

302
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.053
she held power.

303
00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.349
I knew her dirty secrets.

304
00:22:31.399 --> 00:22:32.232
Marylin?

305
00:22:33.496 --> 00:22:34.329
- Mhm?

306
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.543
- What do you think?

307
00:22:49.483 --> 00:22:51.183
- I can't see the tag.

308
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.100
Who is the designer?

309
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.030
- Well. I don't know if you remember

310
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.500
I told you in the
interview. I'm a designer.

311
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.980
So I thought that maybe
you might want to wear-

312
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.870
- I don't give a shit
what you thought. darling.

313
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.330
I didn't hire somebody to try

314
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.840
and promote me their cheap crap.

315
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:11.450
some designs which were put together

316
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.970
in an apartment block building. okay?

317
00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.990
Look. the Hollywood network guy is here

318
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.110
in an hour and I'm stressed.

319
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.943
I hired you as a personal shopper.

320
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.560
Now. in the nicest possible way.

321
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.056
could you try and
present me with something

322
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.283
which doesn't make me
look like a travesty?

323
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.050
- I have this one.

324
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.793
- That's better.
- I can iron it for you.

325
00:23:37.843 --> 00:23:38.640
- I should hope so.

326
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:39.793
I've got to go.

327
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:43.360
Dylan. the interviewer guy. is
going to be here in an hour.

328
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:44.560
I've got to do my hair.

329
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.493
- Marylin. I'm sorry.

330
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.390
I am.

331
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.460
- Oh. darling. look.

332
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:53.790
I was just teasing you. okay?

333
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.630
Just seeing how much you could
take before enough's enough.

334
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.620
Some girls can't take it.

335
00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:00.570
Good on you. girl.

336
00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.403
You're obedient.

337
00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:06.080
This is
what got me about her.

338
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.590
These moments where she would destroy me

339
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.800
to the point of tears.

340
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.403
then leave me feeling warm.

341
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.323
No one could do this.

342
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.593
She had power over me in a
way that I can't describe.

343
00:24:55.346 --> 00:24:57.267
- Thank you so much for the interview.

344
00:24:57.317 --> 00:24:58.526
Mwah.

345
00:24:58.576 --> 00:24:59.536
- Thank you for having me.

346
00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.343
- No. it's my pleasure having you here.

347
00:25:01.393 --> 00:25:02.510
- No problem.

348
00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.110
Oh. thank you very much for the um.

349
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.240
the interview. you know. the exposure

350
00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:08.099
the interview will bring.

351
00:25:08.123 --> 00:25:09.510
It will help a lot.

352
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.660
- How do you feel now?

353
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.576
So you're just
walking around her house?

354
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.560
Dude. how did you even get in?

355
00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.580
- It's harmless fun.

356
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:36.870
No. it's risky. okay?

357
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.773
Dangerous.

358
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.040
- It doesn't feel dangerous.

359
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.045
Is the danger
what's turning you on?

360
00:25:45.095 --> 00:25:46.345
- I don't know.

361
00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.080
I guess so.

362
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.380
You know what
month it is. right?

363
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.800
Arabella.
- Yes. of course.

364
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.170
- Is that why you're going crazy?

365
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.620
You're not drinking or doing drugs. right?

366
00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:01.080
- No. I know it's the week that mum died

367
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.080
and I'm not doing this because of that.

368
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.973
I'm just enjoying the moment. okay?

369
00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.420
Just be careful. yeah?

370
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.200
Arabella.

371
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.223
- Gotta go. okay?

372
00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.010
I'm just gonna set the mood.

373
00:27:33.488 --> 00:27:34.366
Can I grab a shower?

374
00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:35.260
Sure.

375
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.256
Won't your husband be back soon?

376
00:27:37.306 --> 00:27:38.823
No. he won't.

377
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.680
You like watching. don't you?

378
00:28:07.572 --> 00:28:10.322
You've been watching for a while.

379
00:28:14.403 --> 00:28:18.820
What I can't figure out is
why haven't you joined me?

380
00:28:25.913 --> 00:28:28.913
- Marylin-
- Stay down. on all fours.

381
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.462
You treat others like an animal.

382
00:28:32.486 --> 00:28:34.810
you deserve to be treated like an animal.

383
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.660
and behave like one and act like one.

384
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.400
All that time. you thought
you were in control.

385
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.990
playing around. watching me.

386
00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.193
I was in control.

387
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.253
I knew.

388
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.770
- What does this mean?

389
00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.036
Are you going to call the police?

390
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.993
- Of course not.

391
00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:55.860
You're my submissive now.

392
00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.293
- Submissive?

393
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.793
- You do whatever I tell you to do.

394
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.380
- Yes.

395
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.220
- Yes. Mistress.

396
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:10.343
- Yes. Mistress.

397
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.887
- Get back inside.

398
00:29:44.332 --> 00:29:46.216
- Round two. eh?

399
00:29:46.266 --> 00:29:47.599
- Just a minute.

400
00:30:23.907 --> 00:30:24.824
Sit on him.

401
00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:29.844
Sit on him.

402
00:31:18.387 --> 00:31:20.220
I want you to ruin me.

403
00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.763
- Now she knew.

404
00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.063
All limits were off. right?

405
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.693
That was amazing.

406
00:32:20.675 --> 00:32:22.680
Absolutely incredible.

407
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.260
- How long have you been
into that sort of thing?

408
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.840
- I've never been into this sort of thing.

409
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.070
- Don't lie.

410
00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.260
- I'm not.

411
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:33.417
This is extreme for me.

412
00:32:33.467 --> 00:32:35.900
I've only ever messed
around with my girlfriends.

413
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:37.210
experimented with men.

414
00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.140
- What sort of experiments?

415
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:42.710
- Sharing men. public places.

416
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.193
- What's the most public
thing that you've done?

417
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.567
- Um...

418
00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:49.484
Okay. when I was 17...

419
00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:50.974
- Mhm?
- I was catching the tube home

420
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.913
and I saw my best friend's dad.

421
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.030
We were headed in the same direction

422
00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.113
and he'd had quite a few to drink.

423
00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.483
So we sat next to each other.

424
00:33:01.555 --> 00:33:04.160
and he put his hand on my thigh

425
00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.810
and up my skirt and I wasn't wearing

426
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.030
any knickers that day
because I had just been

427
00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.130
to my boyfriend's and
I'd lost my virginity

428
00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.160
and my knickers kind of
got a bit lost?

429
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:18.610
I guess I was still turned on

430
00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:23.103
and he touched me in all the right places.

431
00:33:24.504 --> 00:33:27.263
and that's when I had my first orgasm.

432
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.700
on the tube by my best friend's dad.

433
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.088
- Did she ever find out?

434
00:33:33.138 --> 00:33:33.971
- No.

435
00:33:35.209 --> 00:33:38.443
She would've disowned me if she knew.

436
00:33:40.126 --> 00:33:41.660
- Were there other people on the tube?

437
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:42.620
Yeah.

438
00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:43.716
Did they
know what was happening?

439
00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.450
- A few of them were aware.

440
00:33:46.827 --> 00:33:48.910
- Was it his touch you liked.

441
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.420
or the fact that people watched it happen?

442
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.713
- I liked the fact that
people were watching.

443
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.503
- You are going to do everything

444
00:34:12.553 --> 00:34:15.040
I tell you to do from now on.

445
00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:19.770
If I tell you a place and
a time. you will abide.

446
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.910
- Yes. Mistress.

447
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.850
- You will be paid the same
as that of a personal shopper.

448
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.770
Do you understand?

449
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.170
Yes. Mistress.

450
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040
- What do you think?

451
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.870
- I think...
- Mhm?

452
00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.893
- This one.

453
00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:46.163
I think you look divine.

454
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.670
- Oh. what are your plans for tonight?

455
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.870
- Plans?

456
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.760
- Yes. What are you doing tonight?

457
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:55.763
- Not a lot.

458
00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.300
- All right. take one of
my dresses and put it on.

459
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:02.790
I want you to be a guest at one

460
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.962
of my husband's business meetings tonight.

461
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.230
- Your husband's business meeting?

462
00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.053
I. I don't think that's
a good idea. Marylin.

463
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.220
- Hush.

464
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:15.373
I need a guest.

465
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:22.030
And just like
that. I had butterflies.

466
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.130
just like a young girl on her first date.

467
00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.080
- Well. I think the business
is going to go under.

468
00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.060
- Well. coming from
you. someone who's never

469
00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:33.760
had a business deal before.

470
00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:35.476
- To be fair. he nearly
landed the last account.

471
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.950
- Until I got my hands on it.

472
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.460
- Fucking prick.

473
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.220
- See the business
relationship's still going well.

474
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:46.093
- Yeah. the usual. Bollocks.

475
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.563
- He's gonna get the call.

476
00:35:49.613 --> 00:35:53.941
- He needs to get the call.
I've got a lot riding on this.

477
00:36:00.073 --> 00:36:00.982
- Come on!

478
00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:55.793
will you just lay with me

479
00:36:55.843 --> 00:36:58.355
broken part at least

480
00:37:03.477 --> 00:37:05.955
not the same at all

481
00:37:08.445 --> 00:37:10.727
never finding someone

482
00:37:55.370 --> 00:38:00.370
clean across my face

483
00:38:20.858 --> 00:38:22.620
You okay?

484
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:23.503
- Yeah.

485
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.850
I can't believe he didn't wake up.

486
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:28.993
- Can you imagine?

487
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.770
- What would have happened if he woke?

488
00:38:32.797 --> 00:38:33.606
- There's something inside me

489
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.563
which just wants to wake him up.

490
00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:40.610
- The other day. the way
he spoke to me about you.

491
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.443
such spite in his tone.

492
00:38:44.644 --> 00:38:46.883
- Oh. It's been that way for a long time.

493
00:38:47.978 --> 00:38:49.387
- Why do you do it?

494
00:38:49.437 --> 00:38:52.085
Why do you stay in such
a loveless relationship?

495
00:38:52.135 --> 00:38:53.552
- It's pointless.

496
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:55.970
He won't let me leave.

497
00:38:56.824 --> 00:38:58.850
He says he can take everything from me.

498
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.300
My home. my money even my career.

499
00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:04.680
- So you're trapped by him?

500
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.230
- That's how he makes me feel.

501
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:11.593
Trapped in this emotionally black place.

502
00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:19.636
You're still good for this. yeah?

503
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.945
- Yeah.
- Yeah. you sure?

504
00:39:20.995 --> 00:39:22.483
- Mhm.
- All right.

505
00:39:22.533 --> 00:39:24.653
Everything you need should be in here.

506
00:39:26.511 --> 00:39:29.449
Got names. got numbers. got times.

507
00:39:29.499 --> 00:39:30.335
So wherever you need to find her.

508
00:39:30.359 --> 00:39:31.520
it's going to be in here. all right?

509
00:39:31.544 --> 00:39:32.327
Great.

510
00:39:32.377 --> 00:39:34.136
- First half for you.

511
00:39:34.186 --> 00:39:36.186
Get the rest of it when it's done. yeah?

512
00:39:39.708 --> 00:39:41.600
Who was this guy?

513
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:42.750
Should I tell Marylin?

514
00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:44.786
I didn't want to rock the boat.

515
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:47.153
especially now being her submissive.

516
00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:51.983
I decided I'd keep an
eye on this strange guy.

517
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.193
- Wow. Nice work.

518
00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:02.913
- Thanks.

519
00:40:02.963 --> 00:40:04.020
- You feeling inspired?

520
00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.610
- I guess so.

521
00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.980
- There's some pretty dark
clothes going on here.

522
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.260
What's it for?

523
00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.590
- My manager. he got me
another go at this campaign.

524
00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:16.569
If I get it. it'll be on all
the billboards. shop windows.

525
00:40:16.619 --> 00:40:18.520
It'll really push my line.

526
00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:19.646
- Well if you get it. I guess you're going

527
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:22.220
to have to give up the
personal shopper gig. right?

528
00:40:24.192 --> 00:40:25.092
You don't want to?

529
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.753
- I don't know what I want. Saf.

530
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.367
- Oh. you. have you got
feelings for that woman?

531
00:40:33.417 --> 00:40:34.370
Marylin?
- No.

532
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.053
No. of course not.

533
00:40:37.342 --> 00:40:38.253
It's not like that.

534
00:40:42.646 --> 00:40:44.395
She knows.

535
00:40:44.445 --> 00:40:46.020
- What? Knows what?

536
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.280
- About me watching.

537
00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:48.250
- No way.

538
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.878
- I've joined a few times. too.

539
00:40:49.928 --> 00:40:51.640
- Oh my god. stop.

540
00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.740
No. oh. Arabella. what about her husband?

541
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:57.693
- He's so ungrateful and
he doesn't deserve her.

542
00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:00.212
- You do?

543
00:41:00.262 --> 00:41:01.095
What?

544
00:41:05.816 --> 00:41:06.816
I'll see ya.

545
00:41:14.336 --> 00:41:15.169
- Marylin?

546
00:41:16.645 --> 00:41:17.478
Open up!

547
00:41:47.073 --> 00:41:47.906
Marylin?

548
00:42:31.544 --> 00:42:33.127
- Don't look at me.

549
00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:42.424
- What happened?

550
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:45.660
Where is he?

551
00:42:50.433 --> 00:42:51.683
Who wrote that?

552
00:42:54.384 --> 00:42:55.384
- He's left.

553
00:42:57.399 --> 00:42:59.413
He won't be back until tomorrow.

554
00:42:59.463 --> 00:43:00.796
- What happened?

555
00:43:06.806 --> 00:43:10.740
- We had an argument and
I just tried to walk out

556
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:12.227
and he turned violent.

557
00:43:12.277 --> 00:43:13.510
- Marylin?

558
00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.780
How many times has he hit you?

559
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:20.197
- I'm a big girl. I can handle myself.

560
00:43:26.703 --> 00:43:31.060
It doesn't matter.

561
00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:32.360
I just wanna be set free.

562
00:43:33.776 --> 00:43:37.109
I mean. I can't go on like this anymore.

563
00:43:47.097 --> 00:43:48.147
How did I...

564
00:43:48.197 --> 00:43:51.173
How did I turn into such a weak person?

565
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.260
How could I let him do this to me?

566
00:43:55.956 --> 00:43:58.956
- You are so much better than this.

567
00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:06.494
- Screw it.

568
00:44:06.544 --> 00:44:07.627
Let's go out.

569
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:09.463
- Now?

570
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:16.963
- Let me show you where
I go when I'm in pain.

571
00:44:32.949 --> 00:44:33.790
- Evening. Marylin.

572
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.673
- Evening.

573
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.540
- Sorry miss. it's members only.

574
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.713
- She's with me.

575
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:42.013
- Relation to you?

576
00:44:42.063 --> 00:44:43.163
- She's my daughter.

577
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.963
- You may leave your coat on the side.

578
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.190
I've never been
anywhere like it before.

579
00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.830
I mean. I'm not naive.

580
00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.520
I know these places
existed. but going to one?

581
00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:04.773
Now that was an experience.

582
00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.770
- Good. doggie.

583
00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:10.113
Get on the floor. doggie.

584
00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:13.633
Kiss my shoe.

585
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:16.510
where you belong.

586
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.600
- I want you all to relish tonight.

587
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.480
Enjoy yourselves.

588
00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:23.887
Take advantage of the many
rooms we have in our chamber.

589
00:45:23.937 --> 00:45:26.810
but most of all take
advantage of each other.

590
00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.450
As always. no photography
to be had in the chamber.

591
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.150
and as ever. what happens in the chamber

592
00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.663
stays in the chamber.

593
00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.073
We are strangers outside.

594
00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.480
but lovers inside.

595
00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.323
Let the night begin!

596
00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.263
Ah. Marylin.

597
00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.663
So glad you could join us.

598
00:45:56.697 --> 00:45:59.114
- You know what I'm here for.

599
00:46:00.089 --> 00:46:01.790
- And what have you brought us?

600
00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:02.913
- My daughter.

601
00:46:04.103 --> 00:46:05.252
Bella.

602
00:46:05.302 --> 00:46:06.135
- Bella.

603
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:08.093
First time?

604
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:10.123
- It is.

605
00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:13.943
- We best show you the ropes.

606
00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.323
- Don't embarrass me. Harder.

607
00:46:18.615 --> 00:46:19.815
- Are you enjoying this?

608
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:21.703
- Yes. I am.

609
00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.820
Are you?

610
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:25.670
- Does it not hurt?

611
00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.723
- I enjoy the pain.

612
00:46:28.142 --> 00:46:30.590
The masters only inflict
the scars when needed.

613
00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.090
Are you not
used to the pain. Bella?

614
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.899
- On your knees.

615
00:46:38.949 --> 00:46:39.732
What?

616
00:46:39.782 --> 00:46:41.032
- On the floor.

617
00:47:08.665 --> 00:47:09.498
Wake up.

618
00:47:11.753 --> 00:47:13.613
Would you do anything for me?

619
00:47:13.663 --> 00:47:14.996
- Yes. Mistress.

620
00:48:01.522 --> 00:48:02.355
- Yes.

621
00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:14.956
- I would do anything for you.

622
00:48:17.415 --> 00:48:18.248
I mean it.

623
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.013
I am your submissive now.

624
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.683
- How far are you willing to go?

625
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.143
- I'd do anything. so
you have full control.

626
00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.513
I fear for myself.

627
00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:54.000
- The day you revealed to me

628
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:56.250
that you knew I was
watching the whole time.

629
00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.683
I saw a man in your house.

630
00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:00.873
A hooded man.

631
00:49:03.603 --> 00:49:06.292
I've seen him talking with your husband.

632
00:49:06.342 --> 00:49:07.175
- What man?

633
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.363
- He was creeping around your house.

634
00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:12.756
I thought it was just one of your men.

635
00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.803
but I've seen him since.

636
00:49:17.901 --> 00:49:19.101
- I think I'm in danger.

637
00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:26.273
- I will do whatever it takes
to keep you safe. Mistress.

638
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:02.743
- Arabella?

639
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:07.083
- Good morning. Marylin.

640
00:50:08.191 --> 00:50:10.887
- Ah. not just an
excellent personal shopper.

641
00:50:10.937 --> 00:50:13.380
and a very pretty face.

642
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:15.730
the girl can make an
excellent breakfast. too.

643
00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:19.780
Arabella. you should show
my wife the ropes some time.

644
00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:21.930
She could do with learning a thing or two.

645
00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:29.895
- Oh no. Marylin.

646
00:50:29.945 --> 00:50:31.640
Yours is this one.

647
00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:35.203
I made Ross's extra strong.
just how he likes it.

648
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:43.233
- Plans today?

649
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.290
- Not as yet.

650
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.790
- God. I swear. you spend more time

651
00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.450
lazing around this house
than you ever do writing.

652
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.160
No wonder you haven't had
a hit in over 10 years.

653
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:55.503
and no wonder you're always
after my sweet penny.

654
00:50:58.201 --> 00:51:00.080
- I have just submitted my manuscript

655
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:02.103
to my publisher to be reviewed.

656
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.070
I needed downtime. a holiday.

657
00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.520
- Christ. your whole
life's a holiday. isn't it?

658
00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:13.663
Oh. it's the life of luxury
that you lead. isn't it...

659
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:29.060
Call an ambulance.

660
00:51:35.243 --> 00:51:36.058
Call an ambulance.

661
00:51:36.108 --> 00:51:37.159
- Call...

662
00:51:37.209 --> 00:51:38.397
Call an ambulance?

663
00:51:45.228 --> 00:51:46.699
So when he
fell. he was facing this way.

664
00:51:46.723 --> 00:51:48.320
with his back to the garden.

665
00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:49.770
- Forensics confirmed he was faced

666
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.370
three feet away from the table.

667
00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.190
- So you have no indication of anyone

668
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.560
that wanted to harm your husband.

669
00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:09.190
Mrs. Blacklock-Charterhouse?

670
00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.033
- No. No one potentially. no.

671
00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.203
- I do have something to confess.

672
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:28.933
There was a man.

673
00:52:30.393 --> 00:52:31.573
A hooded man.

674
00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.883
- And when was this?

675
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.330
- The other day I was
dropping gowns off for Marylin

676
00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.823
and he was in the home.

677
00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:41.766
I didn't think anything of it.

678
00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:44.170
I thought. I thought maybe. maybe.

679
00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.710
maybe a visitor who had easy access?

680
00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.863
- Well my husband did
allow entrance to people.

681
00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.880
- So this could have been
somebody that he knew?

682
00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:54.670
- He knew a lot of people.

683
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.303
You had a lot of ties and he owed money.

684
00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:12.820
We can't see each other for a while.

685
00:53:17.291 --> 00:53:18.124
- Why?

686
00:53:21.743 --> 00:53:23.420
- I can't risk the truth coming out.

687
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:25.163
- They won't suspect me.

688
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:35.793
- God. no. they really won't suspect.

689
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:44.940
How did it feel to have the control

690
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:46.803
to take away a person's life?

691
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:51.053
My husband's life?

692
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:54.990
You're dominant.

693
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.020
You took away a massive part of my life.

694
00:53:58.070 --> 00:53:59.073
How did that feel?

695
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:07.083
- I liked the fact you
couldn't do anything.

696
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.240
You were completely unaware of the fact

697
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:13.890
that I had done something
to end his miserable life.

698
00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:19.643
and allow you a new chance at everything.

699
00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.263
- There's something deep inside you which.

700
00:54:25.247 --> 00:54:26.393
well. it scares me.

701
00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:28.440
- What do you mean?

702
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:39.630
- In that moment you had
control and you were dangerous.

703
00:54:42.166 --> 00:54:44.987
It's like you would do anything for me.

704
00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:48.660
Anything.

705
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:50.590
- I have had men in my life treat me

706
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.703
just as bad as he treated you.

707
00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:57.513
I was scared of having
control for a long time.

708
00:54:59.286 --> 00:55:00.683
I guess in a way I still am.

709
00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:06.913
- Who was that guy?

710
00:55:08.081 --> 00:55:09.498
- You remember...

711
00:55:10.872 --> 00:55:12.872
I told you that story...

712
00:55:15.016 --> 00:55:15.849
About...

713
00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:18.683
My best friend's dad?

714
00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:21.893
On the tube?

715
00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:26.093
It was hot at the time.

716
00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:32.420
but looking back. it was
completely messed up.

717
00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.460
The memory I had of it was all I wanted.

718
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:45.533
He would fuck me whenever
Saffie wasn't in.

719
00:55:47.986 --> 00:55:48.819
Fuck.

720
00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.950
I'd even go around to his just knowing

721
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.120
she wasn't there just to
get more of him.

722
00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:56.953
- What changed?

723
00:55:57.003 --> 00:56:01.433
I mean. what stopped
you from wanting more?

724
00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:05.300
- He pushed me away.

725
00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:11.093
He led me on for just over nine months.

726
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:18.520
and when I told him I
wanted something serious.

727
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:22.190
he pulled back and he cut me off.

728
00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.660
My messages. my calls.

729
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:26.803
He even made Saffie avoid me.

730
00:56:29.257 --> 00:56:31.860
I saw him out one day and I told him

731
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:33.463
that I was telling Saffie.

732
00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:37.000
He freaked out.

733
00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:41.583
I knew at the time. I knew
how much he wanted me.

734
00:56:44.959 --> 00:56:46.703
He begged me not to.

735
00:56:49.089 --> 00:56:50.793
I probably wouldn't have done either.

736
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:54.270
Two days later...

737
00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.083
He hung himself.

738
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:10.303
I was alone.

739
00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:12.853
Isolated.

740
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:16.620
For the first time in my life.

741
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:19.280
I suffered the first death and heartbreak

742
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:21.673
all wrapped up in one big secret.

743
00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:23.730
I couldn't tell anyone.

744
00:57:24.694 --> 00:57:27.303
I was scared of what I was
able to do with control.

745
00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:31.690
What I was able to make somebody do.

746
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.437
And since then. I never
took control of a situation.

747
00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:45.253
- But today you had control.

748
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:48.823
- Yeah. In a different way.

749
00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:54.033
Under the power of you. under
the control of you. my dom.

750
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:57.180
- That's what makes you a good sub.

751
00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:01.683
- I guess.

752
00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:07.870
I guess being a sub is a way

753
00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.833
of how I can avoid what happened before.

754
00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.910
A week had passed and
still nothing from Marylin.

755
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.650
I had to take my mind off this.

756
00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:57.893
turn this emotion into something.

757
00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:15.910
- I think your work is dark. mysterious.

758
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.510
There's something about it.

759
00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:20.080
just pulls at the heart strings.

760
00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:23.040
and wants me to know your secrets.

761
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:25.890
It's like these designs have been written

762
00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.110
with secrets behind them.

763
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.853
all the clothes telling their own story.

764
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:36.306
How long would it take you
to deliver some sample items?

765
00:59:36.356 --> 00:59:38.365
- We could have them to
you by the weekend. right?

766
00:59:38.415 --> 00:59:40.460
- Yeah. we could

767
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.300
- Hmm.

768
00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:43.720
I'm interested in making an order.

769
00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:45.123
Let's see where this goes.

770
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.159
Hello. this
is the voicemail of

771
00:59:49.209 --> 00:59:51.050
Marylin Blacklock-Charterhouse.

772
00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:53.363
Please leave a message after the tone.

773
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.650
- Hey Marylin.

774
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.533
It's me.

775
00:59:57.370 --> 00:59:59.360
I've got some exciting news.

776
00:59:59.410 --> 01:00:01.790
and I was wondering if
you wanted to go out

777
01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.323
for a drink later to celebrate?

778
01:00:06.692 --> 01:00:08.292
We could celebrate a few things.

779
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:40.740
Don't move!

780
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.913
You tell me who the hell you
are or I'm calling the police.

781
01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:49.690
Answer my fucking question!

782
01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.190
- I am working for the
deceased Mr. Ross Charterhouse.

783
01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.223
- You're here to kill her. aren't you?

784
01:00:54.273 --> 01:00:56.080
You're here to kill Marylin.

785
01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:58.030
- I was hired by Mr. Charterhouse.

786
01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.389
I'm a private detective.

787
01:01:00.439 --> 01:01:01.439
- Detective?

788
01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:06.650
- Mr. Charterhouse feared for his life.

789
01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:09.940
He paid me to do research
into Ms. Charterhouse.

790
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:13.310
find out about her plans.
where she was going.

791
01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.323
who she was doing.

792
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:19.623
We're both used to a little
sneaking. are we not?

793
01:01:20.559 --> 01:01:23.090
- What do you mean he feared for his life?

794
01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:25.754
He wasn't so innocent. He was abusive.

795
01:01:25.804 --> 01:01:28.310
- Marylin Charterhouse is poison.

796
01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.880
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

797
01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:31.763
- No.

798
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:37.770
- She's got you hook. line.
and sinker. hasn't she?

799
01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.310
- I don't know who the hell you are

800
01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.220
or what you think you're doing.

801
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:43.420
but you are breaking and entering.

802
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:44.973
- As are you.

803
01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.423
He wanted me to find
out what she was doing.

804
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:54.860
Force Marylin to expose her plan before

805
01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:00.253
it was too late. which was the case.

806
01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:02.703
- Get out of here.

807
01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.910
- Be careful around that woman.

808
01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:13.333
I don't know what she has told
you. what lie she has spun.

809
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:15.880
She will throw you under the bus

810
01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:17.820
just like she did with Mr. Charterhouse.

811
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:21.470
Took him for all he
worth. made a joke of him.

812
01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.118
and made a quick escape.

813
01:02:23.168 --> 01:02:26.203
That woman will trick you into
doing just about anything.

814
01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.430
She has that power over people.

815
01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.253
She will give you the
control. but believe you me.

816
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:38.150
you will never. ever have the control

817
01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.743
when that woman is present.

818
01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.053
- Something hit me.

819
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:47.710
In this moment. I began
to question Marylin.

820
01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.770
Had I been played this whole time.

821
01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:55.363
like a mouse in a cage.
a python had lured me in.

822
01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:00.180
wrapped itself around me.
and taken my life away?

823
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:20.433
Going somewhere?

824
01:03:21.546 --> 01:03:26.546
- What are you doing here?

825
01:03:33.447 --> 01:03:34.993
- What's going on?

826
01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:39.236
- How did it feel to have the control

827
01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.000
to take away a person's life?

828
01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:42.480
My husband's life.

829
01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:44.530
Hello. Detective
Lucinda Morley speaking.

830
01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.529
How can I help you?

831
01:03:46.579 --> 01:03:47.412
- I've told you.

832
01:03:49.303 --> 01:03:51.783
- Did it make you feel good
inside taking that away from me?

833
01:03:52.684 --> 01:03:53.517
- Yes.

834
01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.256
- Oh my god. is that why you're here?

835
01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.580
Are you here to kill me. too?

836
01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:00.270
Is that why you in my home uninvited?

837
01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.780
- I spoke to the man who
broke into your house.

838
01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:04.523
He was a private detective.

839
01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.250
He was hired by your husband

840
01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:10.513
because he was fearful for his life.

841
01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:13.640
Of what you might do.

842
01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:17.067
- Good. because he should have been.

843
01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:27.520
- You always planned to
kill him. didn't you?

844
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:29.670
- Don't act like that's big news.

845
01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.320
- Did you ever plan to kill him yourself

846
01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.470
or was it always going to be me?

847
01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.030
- It was always going to be you.

848
01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.433
I like to keep my hands clean.

849
01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:43.200
Poor little puppy.

850
01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:45.070
Never saw it coming.

851
01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.120
This whole time you've been submissive

852
01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:49.780
and now you think that
you've got the confidence

853
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:52.310
to put me in my place?

854
01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.990
I don't think so.

855
01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.823
I'm the one with the power
in this relationship.

856
01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:03.743
- You played me.

857
01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:06.560
He was right.

858
01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:08.083
You played me.

859
01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:13.010
- Oh. don't cry.

860
01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:15.710
Somebody had to be chosen.

861
01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.000
I mean to hell. did I
ever a personnel shopper?

862
01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:21.390
I don't think so. no.

863
01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.350
I needed someone in need. desperate.

864
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.053
and you were the perfect person.

865
01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.230
Oh. the way you came
into that job interview.

866
01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.697
I ripped you apart in seconds.

867
01:05:30.747 --> 01:05:32.310
But why are you here?

868
01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.040
Everybody else in that waiting room

869
01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:35.890
actually wants this as a profession.

870
01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:40.053
So how are you of taking orders?

871
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:43.692
- I think I can take guidance really well.

872
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.634
- Don't look at me.

873
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:11.513
- What happened?

874
01:06:11.563 --> 01:06:12.809
- I went to walk out
and he turned violent.

875
01:06:12.833 --> 01:06:15.170
- I would do anything for you.

876
01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.373
- How far are you willing to go?

877
01:06:16.397 --> 01:06:18.120
- I am your submissive now.

878
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:19.723
- I think I'm in danger.

879
01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.810
- Be careful around that woman.

880
01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.710
She's got you hook. line
and sinker. hasn't she?

881
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.220
You will never. ever have the control

882
01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:33.700
when that woman is present.

883
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:36.530
- It's not like you made it hard for me.

884
01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.770
I just had to supply you with a few leads

885
01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:40.043
and you took the bait.

886
01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:45.064
I liked the fact
that you couldn't do anything.

887
01:06:45.114 --> 01:06:47.014
You wanted so badly to be free of him.

888
01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.330
completely unaware of the fact that

889
01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.803
I had done something to him.

890
01:06:51.853 --> 01:06:54.230
That I were the one to
end his miserable life

891
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:57.693
and allow you a new chance at everything.

892
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:01.723
- Don't be so sad.

893
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:04.720
He was a complete dick anyway.

894
01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:08.330
You did something good
for society. and for me.

895
01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:11.120
People don't want scum
like that around here.

896
01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:14.561
Besides. you've given me a
great ending to my new novel.

897
01:07:14.611 --> 01:07:16.306
- You tricked me.

898
01:07:16.356 --> 01:07:17.189
- Yeah.

899
01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:20.630
I guess it's showtime.

900
01:07:35.966 --> 01:07:39.276
- Oh no. don't!

901
01:07:40.859 --> 01:07:41.840
- Fuck.

902
01:07:46.102 --> 01:07:46.935
Take this.

903
01:07:57.658 --> 01:07:59.241
There's a good sub.

904
01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:03.396
Marylin?

905
01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:05.320
- She's in here!

906
01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:06.787
Come and get her!

907
01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.837
She's crazy. please!

908
01:08:08.887 --> 01:08:11.260
She's trying to kill me! Please!

909
01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:12.143
Please!

910
01:08:13.234 --> 01:08:14.806
She killed my husband!

911
01:08:14.856 --> 01:08:16.489
Come and get her!

912
01:08:16.539 --> 01:08:17.566
Help!

913
01:08:17.616 --> 01:08:18.533
Help. help!

914
01:08:20.869 --> 01:08:24.760
- Hands out where I can see 'em!

915
01:08:57.859 --> 01:08:59.460
It's me again.

916
01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:02.720
Just as she planned the entire time.

917
01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:04.230
I was sentenced for his murder

918
01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.453
and faced six years behind bars.

919
01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:09.370
I was released early for good behavior.

920
01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.050
All of those years locked
away in a caged room

921
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:16.120
made me realize who I really was.

922
01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:17.883
where my fit was in the world.

923
01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:21.430
and on my release date. I was surprised

924
01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:25.060
to find Marylin waiting
for me outside the jail.

925
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:28.723
ready to take me back to my
home. to where I belonged.

926
01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.160
- How are you?

927
01:09:36.784 --> 01:09:38.400
Answer your Mistress.

928
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:39.963
- I am well. Mistress.

929
01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.043
- There's a good sub.

930
01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:48.980
How does it feel being
locked away in there

931
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:50.190
knowing that I'm outside

932
01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.900
and I can sleep with whomever I want?

933
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:54.843
Who's in control now?

934
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:57.893
- You are. Mistress.

935
01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.610
- I control you.

936
01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:02.780
Nobody else.

937
01:10:28.043 --> 01:10:30.375
nothing more than you keep

938
01:10:30.425 --> 01:10:32.737
you don't want to be

939
01:10:32.787 --> 01:10:35.663
And so the story continues.

940
01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:39.730
I had found my place.

941
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.590
I had found where I'd always
belonged in the world.

942
01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.620
It wasn't in the fashion
industry. it was as her pet.

943
01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:50.803
You probably think I'm crazy.
and I guess in a way I am.

944
01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:55.683
But there was nothing
I would have changed.

945
01:11:36.495 --> 01:11:38.840
will you just lay with me

946
01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:41.375
broken part at least

947
01:11:46.496 --> 01:11:48.905
not the same at all

948
01:11:51.447 --> 01:11:53.759
never finding someone
