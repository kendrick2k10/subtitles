5
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:28.304
You don't really stop and think about why

6
00:00:28.338 --> 00:00:30.996
half of the population
of the planet is wearing them

7
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.860
on any given day.

8
00:00:32.894 --> 00:00:34.448
We just are.

9
00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:38.141
Have you ever asked yourself

10
00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:41.144
why everyone you know

11
00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.216
owns multiple pairs of jeans?

12
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:45.942
Dress it up. dress it down...

13
00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:47.254
People know that when they wear them

14
00:00:47.288 --> 00:00:48.669
they look cool.

15
00:00:48.703 --> 00:00:52.604
This one garment can be both

16
00:00:52.638 --> 00:00:57.298
universal and individual at the same time.

17
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.404
There is nothing like that
in the history of clothing.

18
00:00:59.438 --> 00:01:02.924
And. in fact.
Yves Saint Laurent said he wished

19
00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:05.686
he had invented jeans.
that he thought they were

20
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.309
the most important item of
fashion in the 20th century.

21
00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:10.553
They wore them in the mines.

22
00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:12.106
on the cattle trails.

23
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:17.318
My own father wore them toppling
200-foot Douglas firs.

24
00:01:17.353 --> 00:01:20.080
Jeans are the quintessential
American garment.

25
00:01:22.772 --> 00:01:24.636
120 years later. gentlemen.

26
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.226
blue jeans are still basically
the same pair of pants

27
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.298
that came out of the California Gold Rush.

28
00:01:31.332 --> 00:01:34.611
But so much
of the story we tell about jeans

29
00:01:34.646 --> 00:01:36.130
is a myth.

30
00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:39.478
The
strongest pants the West has ever seen.

31
00:01:39.513 --> 00:01:41.687
It is about the cowboys. and the West.

32
00:01:41.722 --> 00:01:43.310
it's about Levi Strauss.

33
00:01:43.344 --> 00:01:44.932
and the Gold Rush.

34
00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:47.969

by rockers and bikers and hippies

39
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:57.151

much. much longer.

43
00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.299
It has a long and deep history

44
00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:09.715
with so many other fascinating stories

45
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.993
that are not always told.

46
00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:24.385
In 1850. Levi
Strauss invented the toughest pants

47
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.835
the West had ever known:

48
00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.182
Levi's blue jeans.

49
00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:30.667
Blue jeans do represent American culture

50
00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:33.187
to the rest of the world.

51
00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:36.294
but like any other good
product of America.

00:02:36.328 --> 00:02:38.917

60
00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.248
The story of denim jeans

61
00:02:59.282 --> 00:03:00.559
is so much more than Wrangler.

62
00:03:00.594 --> 00:03:02.527
it's more than Levi Strauss.

63
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:05.771
especially when it comes to the material.

64
00:03:08.498 --> 00:03:11.570
We're not quite sure
exactly where the fabric originated.

65
00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:14.124
but there are several hints.

66
00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.301
One is Dungri. India. where as
early as the 17th century.

67
00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:21.028
they were creating
a coarse cloth for workers.

68
00:03:21.062 --> 00:03:24.721
eventually called dungaree.

69
00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:27.103
There's the Genoans of Italy.

70
00:03:27.137 --> 00:03:28.794
who had a type of sail cloth

71
00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.351
that was fashioned into work pants.

72
00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:37.527
And there's Nimes. France.
where the cloth there was known

73
00:03:37.562 --> 00:03:41.221
as "serge de Nimes."

74
00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:42.739
Not always. but very often.

75
00:03:42.774 --> 00:03:45.432
these various types of cloth
were dyed blue.

76
00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:48.883
probably to hide dirt as much as anything.

77
00:03:48.918 --> 00:03:53.440
So. we have blue "jean" from Genoa.

78
00:03:53.474 --> 00:03:58.376
we have blue "de Nimes" or denim
coming from Nimes.

79
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.138
but when we make it into pants in America.

80
00:04:02.172 --> 00:04:07.350
we end up morphing the garment
into blue jeans.

81
00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:12.528
People don't necessarily
think about how their blue jeans

82
00:04:12.562 --> 00:04:14.392
came to be blue.

83
00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:16.256
Historically. that's because of
the indigo dye.

84
00:04:17.878 --> 00:04:21.882
Centuries ago. indigo was said
to be worth its weight in gold.

85
00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:25.713
Competition for it was so fierce
Europeans actually called it

86
00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:28.268
the "devil's dye."

87
00:04:28.302 --> 00:04:29.786
Indigo is in fact a weed.

88
00:04:31.616 --> 00:04:34.722
The process of turning indigo
from this small green leaf

89
00:04:34.757 --> 00:04:39.313
into a dye is a very delicate process;

90
00:04:39.348 --> 00:04:41.936
so only the most skilled
are able to do this.

91
00:04:43.731 --> 00:04:48.322
One of the neatest
things about dying with indigo

92
00:04:48.357 --> 00:04:50.359
is the dye vat is green;
it's not blue.

93
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:57.573
And when you introduce a fabric
like denim to the dye vat.

94
00:04:57.607 --> 00:04:59.644
it comes out green.

95
00:04:59.678 --> 00:05:05.235
And then. as it oxidizes in
our atmosphere. it turns blue.

96
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.858
It is magic.

97
00:05:06.892 --> 00:05:08.342
Indigo dyeing is magic.

98
00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:17.903
In many cultures.
indigo cloth has a spiritual importance.

99
00:05:17.938 --> 00:05:20.941
In Africa. the cloth
is considered the next layer

100
00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:22.874
to the skin.

101
00:05:22.908 --> 00:05:26.360
It holds the person's soul. their spirit.

102
00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:34.713
Africans have had a long history
of working indigo and knew

103
00:05:34.748 --> 00:05:37.060
the special process involved
in making the dye

104
00:05:37.095 --> 00:05:38.061
and in dyeing cloth.

105
00:05:41.548 --> 00:05:44.896
And of course many
African captives who became enslaved

106
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.554
in the new world brought with
them knowledge of how

107
00:05:47.588 --> 00:05:49.901
to extract the blue from the plant.

108
00:05:49.935 --> 00:05:54.595
and how to fix the blue to fabrics.

109
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.047
Indigo is one of the ways
in which slave-holding

110
00:05:58.081 --> 00:06:01.395
became tied to the economic fortunes

111
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.466
of the colonial experiment
in the Americas.

112
00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:08.609
So in the mid-1700s. there was this labor

113
00:06:08.644 --> 00:06:11.163
that had been extracted from Africa.

114
00:06:11.198 --> 00:06:13.787
and indigo presents itself as this thing

115
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.721
with economic possibility.

116
00:06:16.755 --> 00:06:18.205
And then when you add to it

117
00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:22.140
moving the dye stuff from one
end of the world to the other.

118
00:06:22.174 --> 00:06:24.038
it only increased in value.

119
00:06:25.626 --> 00:06:28.111
And Eliza Lucas benefited enormously

120
00:06:28.146 --> 00:06:31.839
from the impact of this trade.

121
00:06:31.874 --> 00:06:35.705
Eliza Lucas has
been credited as literally producing

122
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.189
indigo in America.

123
00:06:37.224 --> 00:06:40.227
She's been credited as a botanist.

124
00:06:40.261 --> 00:06:42.816
She's even written about
in elementary school

125
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.404
and high school textbooks.

126
00:06:44.438 --> 00:06:49.201
Eliza Lucas was the
daughter of a colonial governor.

127
00:06:49.236 --> 00:06:51.031
She had studied botany.

128
00:06:51.065 --> 00:06:56.139
and when Eliza was a teenager.
her father bought her.

129
00:06:56.174 --> 00:06:59.902
among many other plants. indigo.

130
00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:02.870
The gift came from perhaps Antigua.

131
00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:03.871
The South needed something

132
00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:07.116
to add to crop rotation. and tobacco

133
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.187
was something cultivated here.

134
00:07:09.221 --> 00:07:11.672
Rice was cultivated here.

135
00:07:11.707 --> 00:07:13.536
Adding indigo into your crop rotation

136
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:15.365
was a way to find additional profit.

137
00:07:17.367 --> 00:07:20.992
Once Eliza gets
her hands on the indigo seeds.

138
00:07:21.026 --> 00:07:23.063
it takes off in terms of production.

139
00:07:23.097 --> 00:07:28.309
Indigo was a second cash crop
behind rice in South Carolina.

140
00:07:28.344 --> 00:07:30.691
And on the eve of the American Revolution.

141
00:07:30.726 --> 00:07:32.555
more than a million pounds of indigo

142
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.454
was being shipped overseas.

143
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.944
Eliza Lucas was probably one of
the most well-known producers

144
00:07:41.978 --> 00:07:45.637
of indigo in colonial America.

145
00:07:45.672 --> 00:07:48.088
But Eliza's hands weren't blue.

146
00:07:48.122 --> 00:07:50.987
She didn't get her hands dirty
with the indigo crop.

147
00:07:51.022 --> 00:07:54.715
The knowledge to grow indigo
came from enslaved people.

148
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.200
They're the ones that did
the work that allowed her

149
00:07:57.235 --> 00:07:59.996
to become this great planter
that she's been credited for.

150
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.933
Indigo really encapsulates

151
00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:10.559
this problem of how do we begin
to tell the story

152
00:08:10.593 --> 00:08:13.769
of captive people and how we document

153
00:08:13.803 --> 00:08:16.668
their contributions in America.

154
00:08:16.703 --> 00:08:20.327
and to the denim history in particular.

155
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:21.673
We know the names

156
00:08:21.708 --> 00:08:23.537
of all the enslaved people that were owned

157
00:08:23.572 --> 00:08:25.228
by the Lucas and Pinckney family.

158
00:08:25.263 --> 00:08:29.992
"Isaac. Pompey.
Molly. and their child. Nanny...

159
00:08:30.026 --> 00:08:32.166
Mary and her children.
Prince and Be..."

160
00:08:32.201 --> 00:08:35.653
These are generations of families.

161
00:08:35.687 --> 00:08:37.689
We're not just talking about
a husband and a wife.

162
00:08:37.724 --> 00:08:40.209
or a mom and a dad.

163
00:08:40.243 --> 00:08:41.900
We see grandparents on this list.

164
00:08:41.935 --> 00:08:43.661
"Nanny and her children. Juno..."

165
00:08:43.695 --> 00:08:47.285
They're the ones
that came from communities that dyed

166
00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:50.564
all kinds of cloth in beautiful colors.

167
00:08:50.599 --> 00:08:52.808
They're the ones that had
the knowledge of indigo

168
00:08:52.842 --> 00:08:55.707
and created generations
of wealth for these

169
00:08:55.742 --> 00:08:57.675
white slave-holding families.

170
00:09:03.853 --> 00:09:05.337
Back in the 19th century.

171
00:09:05.372 --> 00:09:09.100
denim really dominated.
because it's a strong weave.

172
00:09:09.134 --> 00:09:12.517
So with the rise in durable cotton goods.

173
00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:17.108
denim made itself the accepted second skin

174
00:09:17.142 --> 00:09:19.075
in terms of cloth that was
put into clothing

175
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.525
meant for laborious work.

176
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.460
As American cotton
manufacturing begins to sort of

177
00:09:24.494 --> 00:09:27.428
find its footing in the 18-teens
and 1820s.

178
00:09:27.463 --> 00:09:30.570
mills in Rhode Island.
mills in Massachusetts.

179
00:09:30.604 --> 00:09:33.814
mills in New Hampshire.
they need a source of cotton.

180
00:09:33.849 --> 00:09:37.024
And the only source of cotton to
make these mills

181
00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:38.508
economically viable

182
00:09:38.543 --> 00:09:41.270
is cotton that's being grown
by enslaved men. women.

183
00:09:41.304 --> 00:09:43.479
and children in the American South.

184
00:09:43.513 --> 00:09:45.101
Cotton from Alabama.

185
00:09:45.136 --> 00:09:47.621
cotton from Louisiana.

186
00:09:47.656 --> 00:09:49.140
Texas cotton. Mississippi cotton.

187
00:09:49.174 --> 00:09:51.349
cotton from Georgia.

188
00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:53.489
cotton from Charleston.

189
00:09:53.523 --> 00:09:56.492
It takes two pounds of cotton
to make a pair of jeans.

190
00:09:56.526 --> 00:10:00.082
When you follow
the trail of cotton being grown

191
00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:05.328
in this country in the South.
being shipped to the North.

192
00:10:05.363 --> 00:10:08.677
being woven into blue jeans.

193
00:10:08.711 --> 00:10:12.646
and then being shipped down back
to the South.

194
00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:13.647
where is it going?

195
00:10:13.682 --> 00:10:15.028
Who's wearing it?

196
00:10:15.062 --> 00:10:17.962
There's a database that's called
Freedom on the Move

197
00:10:17.996 --> 00:10:20.481
that has cataloged and crowdsourced

198
00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:23.830
runaway slave advertisements
from all over the United States.

199
00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:29.007
So slavers would put an ad
describing the person

200
00:10:29.042 --> 00:10:31.182
with detailed descriptions
of what they had on them

201
00:10:31.216 --> 00:10:32.493
when they left.

202
00:10:32.528 --> 00:10:34.254
What clothing they were wearing.
what type of clothing.

203
00:10:34.288 --> 00:10:36.359
what color the clothing was.

204
00:10:36.394 --> 00:10:39.915
"Had on when he left. dark
jeans clothes. and a black hat."

205
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:43.573
"He carried off a
blue cloth coat. one blue jeans.

206
00:10:43.608 --> 00:10:45.610
and two or three pair
pantaloons."

207
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.544
"Has on a blue Kentucky
jeans coat and striped pants."

208
00:10:48.578 --> 00:10:51.305
"... wore a brown jeans
coat. and blue jeans pants..."

209
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.962
"New brown jeans."

210
00:10:52.997 --> 00:10:54.654
"Mixed jeans.
frock coat. and pantaloons."

211
00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:56.690
"A pair of jeans pants."

212
00:10:56.725 --> 00:11:01.143
"... a blue jeans homespun
dress coat."

213
00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:03.041
And so you have
advertisements that have very

214
00:11:03.076 --> 00:11:07.321
detailed information
about enslaved people.

215
00:11:07.356 --> 00:11:09.151
And enslaved people were.
in fact. wearing jeans.

216
00:11:11.636 --> 00:11:15.364
This is a story in which
coerced labor produces a raw material

217
00:11:15.398 --> 00:11:18.816
that is exported from one region
to a second region

218
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.440
and which is then sold back
in an ongoing cycle.

219
00:11:25.132 --> 00:11:27.583
An increasing number of
American slaves will come

220
00:11:27.617 --> 00:11:29.412
to be wearing cloth that's manufactured

221
00:11:29.447 --> 00:11:33.416
in the United States. that
travels under a number of names.

222
00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:35.487
that sometimes goes under

223
00:11:35.522 --> 00:11:38.076
an umbrella category of
"Negro cloth."

224
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.805
This is one of the powerful
things about clothing. right?

225
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.428
The ways in which it can be
used. not only for individuals

226
00:11:45.463 --> 00:11:48.604
to perform their own identity.
but also for the ways in which

227
00:11:48.638 --> 00:11:51.124
a dominant society can stigmatize people.

228
00:11:56.646 --> 00:11:58.441
So blue jeans

229
00:11:58.476 --> 00:12:01.721
clearly existed.
clearly predated Levi Strauss.

230
00:12:01.755 --> 00:12:04.654
You're looking at farmers.

231
00:12:04.689 --> 00:12:06.277
you're looking at factory workers.

232
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:09.590
Miners were wearing denim.

233
00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:10.730
The enslaved peoples of America

234
00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:13.422
were clothed very often in denim.

235
00:12:13.456 --> 00:12:19.290
Basically any type of labor. hard work.

236
00:12:19.324 --> 00:12:21.741
that you can think of
in the late 19th century.

237
00:12:21.775 --> 00:12:24.088
you would have found people wearing denim.

238
00:12:24.122 --> 00:12:26.849
Jeans did exist.

239
00:12:26.884 --> 00:12:27.954
but they ripped.

240
00:12:27.988 --> 00:12:31.233
They ripped and they wore down

241
00:12:31.267 --> 00:12:32.337
and they became tatters.

242
00:12:32.372 --> 00:12:33.442
They became unusable.

243
00:12:33.476 --> 00:12:34.684
They didn't last as long.

244
00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:38.309
Anybody who has ever torn a seam

245
00:12:38.343 --> 00:12:41.174
through exertion knows

246
00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:43.659
that there are certain points
in garment structures

247
00:12:43.693 --> 00:12:47.559
that are more stressed than others.

248
00:12:47.594 --> 00:12:50.252
So Jacob Davis is really sort of
the unsung hero here.

249
00:12:51.909 --> 00:12:56.120
Jacob Davis was a tailor in Reno. Nevada.

250
00:12:56.154 --> 00:12:59.606
or somewhere thereabouts in the 1870s.

251
00:13:01.297 --> 00:13:05.681
Nevada was. you know.
one of the great bonanzas at the time.

252
00:13:05.715 --> 00:13:07.614
There's this enormous rush of people.

253
00:13:07.648 --> 00:13:11.756
And great fortunes are made
there from mining gold.

254
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:15.139
But the greatest fortunes
that are made there are not made

255
00:13:15.173 --> 00:13:17.555
by individual prospectors.

256
00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:20.834
They're made by the people
who can sell goods to miners.

257
00:13:20.869 --> 00:13:25.080
So this lady
approached Jacob Davis and she said.

258
00:13:25.114 --> 00:13:26.909
"I have a portly husband
who continues to rip

259
00:13:26.944 --> 00:13:28.290
"his work pants.

260
00:13:28.324 --> 00:13:32.328
and I'd like you to construct
a sturdy pair for him."

261
00:13:32.363 --> 00:13:35.918
So he thought. "Well.
I have all these washer

262
00:13:35.953 --> 00:13:40.440
"and post rivets that people
put on these saddles.

263
00:13:40.474 --> 00:13:42.304
"Let's add these to all these
places he keeps

264
00:13:42.338 --> 00:13:43.512
ripping his pants."

265
00:13:43.546 --> 00:13:45.755
So he adds them to places like

266
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.930
the fly and mouths of pockets.

267
00:13:47.965 --> 00:13:50.726
and even onto the mouth
of the back pocket.

268
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.728
which is a patch pocket.

269
00:13:52.762 --> 00:13:54.523
Customer loved them.

270
00:13:54.557 --> 00:13:56.249
Obviously. word of mouth spread.

271
00:13:56.283 --> 00:13:59.286
Soon he had more customers
than he could handle.

272
00:13:59.321 --> 00:14:02.013
and he wanted to scale up the business.

273
00:14:02.048 --> 00:14:05.534
but he was one man in a
tailor shop in Reno. Nevada.

274
00:14:05.568 --> 00:14:08.295
So he contacted Levi Strauss.

275
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:13.473
who was his dry good supplier
based in San Francisco.

276
00:14:13.507 --> 00:14:16.441
and offered him a partnership deal.

277
00:14:16.476 --> 00:14:18.443
He said. basically. "Let's go
into business together.

278
00:14:18.478 --> 00:14:19.755
"We need a patent.

279
00:14:19.789 --> 00:14:21.205
"We'll take out the patent.

280
00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:23.483
"and then we can make these riveted pants.

281
00:14:23.517 --> 00:14:26.417
because you have the wherewithal
to scale up."

282
00:14:26.451 --> 00:14:28.384
Levi agreed.

283
00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:32.906
The two of them filed for the
patent. and received it in 1873.

284
00:14:32.941 --> 00:14:34.666
The basic design has not changed

285
00:14:34.701 --> 00:14:37.600
in nearly a century and a half.

286
00:14:37.635 --> 00:14:40.189
Today. every pair of Levi blue jeans

287
00:14:40.224 --> 00:14:41.950
has six copper rivets

288
00:14:41.984 --> 00:14:45.229
that ensure the longevity
of each pair of pants.

289
00:14:45.263 --> 00:14:47.093
The rivets were crucial

290
00:14:47.127 --> 00:14:49.647
in the design for durability.

291
00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:50.786
It was like making

292
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.926
some kind of. you know.
armor for your body.

293
00:14:52.961 --> 00:14:54.894
that could just hold up to anything.

294
00:14:54.928 --> 00:14:59.381
With the addition of the copper rivets.

295
00:14:59.415 --> 00:15:03.626
the product becomes the most
durable form of workwear

296
00:15:03.661 --> 00:15:05.939
available to any working American.

297
00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.806
I'm looking for the ultimate jeans!

298
00:15:16.156 --> 00:15:17.157
Hya!

299
00:15:22.093 --> 00:15:24.130
At the end of the 19th century.

300
00:15:24.164 --> 00:15:27.547
Americans were still largely
working with their hands.

301
00:15:27.581 --> 00:15:31.137
Nearly 70% of workers
were toiling on farms.

302
00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:33.898
in factories. mines. or construction.

303
00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:39.386
This. of course. created
a huge market for jeans.

304
00:15:39.421 --> 00:15:40.974
But jeans initially weren't called jeans.

305
00:15:41.009 --> 00:15:44.426
They were called waist overalls.

306
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.256
Overalls were so prevalent
in the culture that jeans were

307
00:15:47.291 --> 00:15:49.983
just a truncated version of overalls

308
00:15:50.018 --> 00:15:51.467
without the bib.

309
00:15:51.502 --> 00:15:53.883
That's where the term
"waist overalls" comes from.

310
00:15:58.267 --> 00:16:00.614
So 1890.

311
00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:04.618
17 years of patent exclusivity
for this rivet reinforced pocket

312
00:16:04.653 --> 00:16:07.345
by Levi Strauss and Company ends.

313
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:12.316
Now anyone can use the rivet
reinforced pocket that wants to.

314
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.042
and everybody does it.

315
00:16:14.076 --> 00:16:17.217
Once they lose their patent protection.

316
00:16:17.252 --> 00:16:19.047
there are rivets everywhere.

317
00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:21.739
there are knockoff logos
and brands everywhere.

318
00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:28.159
So you have
companies called Can't Bust 'Em.

319
00:16:28.194 --> 00:16:29.885
Can't Rip 'Em.

320
00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:32.198
and Never Rip and Never Wear Out.

321
00:16:32.232 --> 00:16:36.443
There were brands
called Blackbear. Dubbleware. Dozfit.

322
00:16:36.478 --> 00:16:37.789
And Fitsu.

323
00:16:37.824 --> 00:16:38.894
Boss of the Road...

324
00:16:38.928 --> 00:16:39.895
Tuf Nut.

325
00:16:39.929 --> 00:16:40.861
Stronghold...

326
00:16:42.311 --> 00:16:44.106
And so you have all these companies

327
00:16:44.141 --> 00:16:48.041
trying to push their version
of the work pant

328
00:16:48.076 --> 00:16:51.769
out into society.

329
00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:56.601
and we start to see so much
evolution going on within jeans.

330
00:16:56.636 --> 00:16:59.087
We started with
one pocket and a button fly.

331
00:16:59.121 --> 00:17:00.674
There were no belt loops.

332
00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:03.643
Most people wore suspenders.

333
00:17:03.677 --> 00:17:07.785
But in mining you
can't have a strap over your shoulder

334
00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.891
that could get snagged
and cause the mine to collapse.

335
00:17:10.926 --> 00:17:15.793
So several folks had a rope tied
around the waistband.

336
00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:17.829
Then a second pocket was added.

337
00:17:17.864 --> 00:17:20.280
and there was also a waist cinch.

338
00:17:20.315 --> 00:17:22.662
And then they added zippers...

339
00:17:22.696 --> 00:17:24.112
Belt loops...

340
00:17:24.146 --> 00:17:26.079
There was a rivet at the crotch.

341
00:17:26.114 --> 00:17:28.116
People had been complaining
about it for years.

342
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.808
I think they were happy
to get rid of that rivet.

343
00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:32.879
and that has never come back.

344
00:17:35.123 --> 00:17:37.470
Denim was changing

345
00:17:37.504 --> 00:17:41.198
and so was America.

346
00:17:41.232 --> 00:17:43.096
That image of someone clad
in denim at the turn of

347
00:17:43.131 --> 00:17:47.307
the 20th century is inevitably.
you know. romanticized.

348
00:17:47.342 --> 00:17:53.865
And the reality is that people
of all different ages. races.

349
00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.214
and genders were wearing denim
during this time.

350
00:17:57.248 --> 00:17:59.319
Sharecroppers in the South.

351
00:17:59.354 --> 00:18:02.736
Chinese immigrants on the
transcontinental railway...

352
00:18:02.771 --> 00:18:04.497
As the word of the Gold Rush spreads

353
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:08.501
not only across the nation.
but across the whole world.

354
00:18:08.535 --> 00:18:10.641
people really from all over the world

355
00:18:10.675 --> 00:18:14.714
come through. and often stay in.
San Francisco.

356
00:18:17.234 --> 00:18:18.269
Turning San Francisco overnight.

357
00:18:18.304 --> 00:18:20.409
not only into a booming boom town.

358
00:18:20.444 --> 00:18:25.345
but also into a place
where you have more diversity.

359
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.865
a more cosmopolitan place

360
00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:30.626
than any other spot
on the face of the Earth.

361
00:18:32.628 --> 00:18:35.044
There was a huge
nativist outcry in San Francisco

362
00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:38.117
at the time...
the idea that other people

363
00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:40.740
from elsewhere are coming to
take our jobs away.

364
00:18:43.398 --> 00:18:46.849
The backlash galvanizes
an immense political movement.

365
00:18:46.884 --> 00:18:50.336
who make it their central platform to

366
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.822
see the expulsion of Chinese labor.

367
00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.829
There's a rise in racism
you do see in the 1880s and '90s...

368
00:19:00.863 --> 00:19:03.038
"No Chinaman made your clothes."

369
00:19:03.072 --> 00:19:07.939
and "Made by white labor only."

370
00:19:07.974 --> 00:19:11.288
Because Levi was
a San Francisco based company.

371
00:19:11.322 --> 00:19:15.188
they decided. "Okay. we're not
hiring any Chinese people.

372
00:19:15.223 --> 00:19:17.535
We're going to give the jobs to
the local white people."

373
00:19:19.641 --> 00:19:22.954
I think it's a
challenge for us as we embrace

374
00:19:22.989 --> 00:19:24.577
how we came to be here.

375
00:19:24.611 --> 00:19:26.993
we have to embrace the whole
story and the whole history.

376
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.722
Jeans are a great example to
think about American history

377
00:19:31.756 --> 00:19:33.448
and a way to go into parts
of American history

378
00:19:33.482 --> 00:19:35.415
that we haven't always addressed.

379
00:19:42.008 --> 00:19:45.080
During the Great
Depression and the Farm Securities Act.

380
00:19:45.114 --> 00:19:48.704
and the contracting of
photographers to go about

381
00:19:48.739 --> 00:19:51.880
the country to document everyday life.

382
00:19:51.914 --> 00:19:55.849
denim became symbolic of our nation.

383
00:19:55.884 --> 00:20:00.716
You see people on the West Coast
wearing jeans.

384
00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:03.409
and people laboring
in the ports and the shipyards.

385
00:20:03.443 --> 00:20:04.858
You see people

386
00:20:04.893 --> 00:20:08.137
in the Empire State sitting on
I-beams during lunch breaks.

387
00:20:08.172 --> 00:20:11.624
And you see tobacco farmers
with sun-faded overalls

388
00:20:11.658 --> 00:20:13.971
and it became this common identity

389
00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:16.905
that I think helps the country

390
00:20:16.939 --> 00:20:19.632
to still feel unified
even during dark times.

391
00:20:19.666 --> 00:20:22.635
The
knives are cutting; the load piles high.

392
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:24.982
The sun beats down from the August sky.

393
00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:28.468
We built our freedom
and strength this way.

394
00:20:28.503 --> 00:20:30.470
We're building it still together.

395
00:20:30.505 --> 00:20:32.265
Up until about the 1930s.

396
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.613
denim was really worn out of necessity.

397
00:20:35.648 --> 00:20:37.615
When we get together we're hard to stop.

398
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.376
Working together...

399
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.275
It wasn't until those
years and beyond that the product

400
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.796
went from a necessity to a fashion.

401
00:20:47.384 --> 00:20:49.662
A lot of that had to do with
this nostalgia

402
00:20:49.696 --> 00:20:52.285
for the American West.

403
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.426
Hey. come back with them horses!

404
00:20:57.325 --> 00:20:59.568
Thanks to westerns.

405
00:20:59.603 --> 00:21:03.227
cowboys became the American figure

406
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.540
that kind of helped us get out
of the Great Depression

407
00:21:05.574 --> 00:21:07.783
in a way.

408
00:21:07.818 --> 00:21:09.026
We didn't have royalty

409
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.028
like in England and other
European countries.

410
00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:12.340
but we had cowboys

411
00:21:12.374 --> 00:21:13.824
wearing blue jeans.

412
00:21:13.858 --> 00:21:15.308
Thank you so much.

413
00:21:15.343 --> 00:21:16.723
They were our knights in shining armor.

414
00:21:16.758 --> 00:21:20.002
Follow me. ma'am.
and you'll never go astray.

415
00:21:20.037 --> 00:21:21.935
Right this way.

416
00:21:25.111 --> 00:21:27.665
It's hard for people
today to really appreciate

417
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.565
how big the western was.

418
00:21:30.599 --> 00:21:33.637
As the United States is
transformed from being

419
00:21:33.671 --> 00:21:35.777
a rural and agrarian nation

420
00:21:35.811 --> 00:21:40.816
to one in which most people
live in cities or towns.

421
00:21:40.851 --> 00:21:44.372
there is a nostalgic embrace

422
00:21:44.406 --> 00:21:46.684
of the frontier world lost.

423
00:21:46.719 --> 00:21:50.654
and the cowboys in those
westerns almost always

424
00:21:50.688 --> 00:21:51.655
were wearing jeans.

425
00:21:56.245 --> 00:21:59.870
And yet. there's no question
that when we look more closely

426
00:21:59.904 --> 00:22:03.667
at the ways in which jeans
come into the West.

427
00:22:03.701 --> 00:22:06.186
the story turns out to be much
more problematic.

428
00:22:08.982 --> 00:22:12.365
The stories we tell are all white people.

429
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.369
In fact. the reality of life
in the American West

430
00:22:16.404 --> 00:22:19.061
was much more multi-ethnic.

431
00:22:19.096 --> 00:22:22.375
You know. a significant portion
of the workforce

432
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.102
were people of color...

433
00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:26.379
people from Mexico.

434
00:22:26.414 --> 00:22:28.899
Native Americans.

435
00:22:28.933 --> 00:22:30.383
African Americans
probably making up an eighth

436
00:22:30.418 --> 00:22:32.972
to a quarter of the cowboy workforce.

437
00:22:35.284 --> 00:22:37.563
So we have a much more complicated reality

438
00:22:37.597 --> 00:22:40.911
that contrasts with the whitening

439
00:22:40.945 --> 00:22:43.189
of those figures in the westerns.

440
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.713
Of course. Hollywood's take on the cowboy

441
00:22:49.747 --> 00:22:52.405
was just the start of denim spreading

442
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.580
beyond the working class.

443
00:22:54.614 --> 00:22:58.480
Now this shift is. is happening

444
00:22:58.515 --> 00:23:02.415
in an era of huge economic schisms.

445
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:07.006
The vast majority of people
were really struggling

446
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.663
during the Great Depression.

447
00:23:08.697 --> 00:23:10.803
but there continued to be

448
00:23:10.837 --> 00:23:14.427
an elite class of individuals.

449
00:23:14.462 --> 00:23:15.601
They still traveled.

450
00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:17.085
They still shopped.

One consequence at the time

455
00:23:26.888 --> 00:23:31.582
was that this idea of the
dude ranch came about.

456
00:23:31.617 --> 00:23:33.481
The dude ranch was essentially

457
00:23:33.515 --> 00:23:37.830
a getaway. like sort of a spa

of many of the sources of income
based on cattle ranching

463
00:23:52.016 --> 00:23:54.087
and other traditional
agricultural pursuits.

464
00:23:54.122 --> 00:23:56.124
many working cattle ranches

465
00:23:56.158 --> 00:23:58.298

466
00:23:58.333 --> 00:24:00.231

476
00:24:25.256 --> 00:24:27.604

This was particularly
an opportunity for women.

482
00:24:40.409 --> 00:24:45.484
American society was still not
fully comfortable with the idea

483
00:24:45.518 --> 00:24:49.384
of women wearing pants in the 1930s.

484
00:24:49.418 --> 00:24:52.283
Bifurcated garments seemed so unladylike.

485
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.081
Vacationing was a secure laboratory...

486
00:24:57.116 --> 00:25:00.119
especially for the women.

487
00:25:00.153 --> 00:25:03.605
When they looked in the mirror.
which I think many dudines did.

488
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.365
they didn't see their old self
from Connecticut

489
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.540
or Rhode Island;

490
00:25:07.575 --> 00:25:10.267
they saw a cowgirl from the movies.

491
00:25:12.131 --> 00:25:16.411
Denim afforded many women the
ability to get dirty. to hunt.

492
00:25:16.445 --> 00:25:18.551
to fish. to ride horses.

493
00:25:18.586 --> 00:25:20.311
So I think blue jeans on a dude ranch

494
00:25:20.346 --> 00:25:22.451
not only gave women the ability

495
00:25:22.486 --> 00:25:24.177
to move more freely.

496
00:25:24.212 --> 00:25:26.490
to experience their bodies
in different ways.

497
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:29.493
but perhaps also to sort of
think more freely.

498
00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:32.358
to rethink their position
in American society.

499
00:25:35.326 --> 00:25:38.295
This was one of
the first times that women felt

500
00:25:38.329 --> 00:25:41.194
comfortable enough to say.
"Hey. you know what?

501
00:25:41.229 --> 00:25:43.058
"I enjoy wearing that kind of clothing.

502
00:25:43.093 --> 00:25:44.094
I'm going to do it."

503
00:25:44.128 --> 00:25:45.509
So the American

504
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:49.513
blue jeans manufacturers
realized that there was

505
00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:51.377
a substantial market to be conquered

506
00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:56.037
by creating blue jeans lines for women.

507
00:25:56.071 --> 00:25:58.453
So you start seeing the design of jeans

508
00:25:58.487 --> 00:26:00.455
beginning to follow fashion

509
00:26:00.489 --> 00:26:05.391
in a way that they didn't previously do

510
00:26:05.425 --> 00:26:09.809
when they were strictly work pants.

511
00:26:13.502 --> 00:26:16.229
Jeans entered the
world of fashion in the 1930s

512
00:26:16.264 --> 00:26:18.369
because they functioned as a souvenir

513
00:26:18.404 --> 00:26:23.340
and they also functioned as a
symbol of wealth and prestige.

514
00:26:23.374 --> 00:26:26.861
Somewhat ironically.
the clothes of the working man

515
00:26:26.895 --> 00:26:31.210
became a symbol that you
belonged to the leisure class.

516
00:26:34.523 --> 00:26:38.873
That's the dichotomy
sort of represented in the juxtaposition

517
00:26:38.907 --> 00:26:42.117
between the Dorothea Lange
photos of the Dust Bowl

518
00:26:42.152 --> 00:26:45.017
and Lady Levi's in "Vogue."

519
00:26:45.051 --> 00:26:48.192
They can co-exist

520
00:26:48.227 --> 00:26:52.231
because there was this extreme
inequality in America.

521
00:27:04.105 --> 00:27:06.970
Since October 16. 1940.

522
00:27:07.004 --> 00:27:10.594
millions of American men
have joined the armed forces

523
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:14.046
to defend our country and
our democratic way of life.

524
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.944
For many men and women.

525
00:27:15.979 --> 00:27:18.084
World War II was the first time
they wore jeans.

526
00:27:18.119 --> 00:27:20.846
The minute
the ship left port. neckties were dropped.

527
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.021
The enlisted men wore dungarees
and the traditional white hats

528
00:27:24.056 --> 00:27:26.127
were dyed blue.

529
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:27.611
Here are the men who will fight.

530
00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:30.683
World War II is a moment where

531
00:27:30.718 --> 00:27:33.652
denim goes global in a sense.

532
00:27:36.827 --> 00:27:41.176
One result of Americans fighting
overseas was that the G.I.s.

533
00:27:41.211 --> 00:27:43.075
when they were off duty.

534
00:27:43.109 --> 00:27:45.767
were in many cases wearing blue jeans.

535
00:27:45.802 --> 00:27:50.082
and the locals took notice

536
00:27:50.116 --> 00:27:51.946
and thought. "Well.
they look like movie stars.

537
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.499
"they look cool.

538
00:27:53.533 --> 00:27:55.397
They look like. you know.
what we want to look like."

539
00:28:00.264 --> 00:28:03.164
There's a way in which during the 1940s.

540
00:28:03.198 --> 00:28:07.099
because of the patriotism
around World War II.

541
00:28:07.133 --> 00:28:11.413
denim almost became the blue

542
00:28:11.448 --> 00:28:14.520
in the red. white. and blue
of the American flag.

something like six million

561
00:28:56.148 --> 00:28:58.391
mothers and daughters
were suddenly going to work

562
00:28:58.426 --> 00:28:59.668
on a daily basis.

563
00:28:59.703 --> 00:29:01.809

Waitress. salesgirls. housewives...

these girls are now ready

00:29:28.076 --> 00:29:30.147
How sweet the rewards of peace.

573
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.808
From all the scattered
battlefields. he returned home

574
00:29:35.843 --> 00:29:40.295
again to find a soldier's welcome.

575
00:29:43.505 --> 00:29:46.301
So. what happens
when the soldiers who were wearing

576
00:29:46.336 --> 00:29:47.509
denim overseas come home?

577
00:29:47.544 --> 00:29:49.718
They kept wearing denim.

578
00:29:49.753 --> 00:29:51.790
Why not?
They're great pants.

579
00:29:51.824 --> 00:29:52.929
They're comfortable.
They're durable.

580
00:29:52.963 --> 00:29:54.378
They had gotten used to them.

581
00:29:54.413 --> 00:29:56.001
They liked them.
Why not?

582
00:29:59.142 --> 00:30:02.628
As the World
War II vets started to come back.

583
00:30:02.662 --> 00:30:04.009
they obviously had been through a lot.

584
00:30:04.043 --> 00:30:06.770
They felt a lot of camaraderie.

585
00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:10.187
They felt a lot of brotherhood
in the trenches.

586
00:30:10.222 --> 00:30:11.775
And they come back

587
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:16.676
into a very staid.
kind of 9:00 to 5:00 lifestyle.

588
00:30:16.711 --> 00:30:20.404
for some people it wasn't going to work.

589
00:30:22.855 --> 00:30:26.997
But the combination
of a big motorcycle and denim.

590
00:30:27.032 --> 00:30:28.688
that really works.

591
00:30:28.723 --> 00:30:30.863
♪ <i>He wore black denim
trousers and motorcycle boots</i> ♪

592
00:30:30.898 --> 00:30:34.556
♪ <i>And a black leather jacket
with an eagle on the back.</i> ♪

593
00:30:34.591 --> 00:30:36.420
They've all got jeans on.

594
00:30:36.455 --> 00:30:38.526
T-shirt with a cigarette pack
rolled up in it...

595
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.770
you look pretty tough.

596
00:30:41.805 --> 00:30:43.807
Suddenly bikers have become
modern-day outlaws.

597
00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:46.430
♪ <i>Well. he never washed his
face and he never combed his hair</i> ♪

598
00:30:46.465 --> 00:30:49.709
♪ <i>He had axel grease embedded
underneath his fingernails.</i> ♪

599
00:30:49.744 --> 00:30:52.333
So the idea of the outlaw.

600
00:30:52.367 --> 00:30:53.955
which has always had

601
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:57.372
a stronghold on the American
popular imagination.

602
00:30:57.407 --> 00:31:00.444
was actually promoted by the movies.

603
00:31:00.479 --> 00:31:02.446
and linked in particular with jeans.

604
00:31:08.383 --> 00:31:10.351
You know. we see that a lot

605
00:31:10.385 --> 00:31:12.284
in the Hollywood of the 1950s.

606
00:31:12.318 --> 00:31:14.148
classically represented by Marlon Brando

607
00:31:14.182 --> 00:31:16.909
in the biker film
"The Wild One."

608
00:31:18.566 --> 00:31:21.603
Brando's character. who was.
of course. the guy who's asked.

609
00:31:21.638 --> 00:31:23.329
"What are you rebelling
against?"

610
00:31:23.364 --> 00:31:25.331
Hey Johnny. what are you
rebelling against?

611
00:31:25.366 --> 00:31:27.886
And he says... What do you got?

612
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.164
Like. "I don't know what it is
that I'm rebelling against.

613
00:31:30.198 --> 00:31:32.166
I'm just doing it."

614
00:31:34.375 --> 00:31:36.308
All bets were off at that point.

615
00:31:36.342 --> 00:31:39.104
A lot of the teenagers
may not have wanted to become

616
00:31:39.138 --> 00:31:40.726
Wally or Beaver.

617
00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.107
But my friends call me Beaver.

618
00:31:42.141 --> 00:31:43.418
Well. may I call you Beaver?

619
00:31:43.453 --> 00:31:44.419
I'd like you to be my friend.

620
00:31:44.454 --> 00:31:46.387
Okay.

621
00:31:46.421 --> 00:31:49.045
They were able to make the choice.

622
00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:51.392
and part of that choice

623
00:31:51.426 --> 00:31:54.360
was. you know. having jeans on.

624
00:31:54.395 --> 00:31:58.986
The early
teens are years of upheaval and turmoil.

625
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.885
They're years of physical
and glandular change.

626
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.576
Parents of almost every child

627
00:32:03.611 --> 00:32:06.855
find the age of puberty
or early adolescence

628
00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:08.374
full of problems.

629
00:32:08.409 --> 00:32:09.755
After World War II.

630
00:32:09.789 --> 00:32:13.517
really the "teenager" as we now
know it came into being.

631
00:32:13.552 --> 00:32:18.246
Their actions may seem
excessive but that's normal for teenagers.

632
00:32:18.281 --> 00:32:20.800
They seem to spend hours in
completely useless activities.

633
00:32:22.216 --> 00:32:23.631
Prior to World War II.

634
00:32:23.665 --> 00:32:27.359
you were either a young person
living at home.

635
00:32:27.393 --> 00:32:29.154
going to school.

636
00:32:29.188 --> 00:32:31.190
or when you were finished with school.

637
00:32:31.225 --> 00:32:33.813
then you entered the workforce.

638
00:32:33.848 --> 00:32:36.437
You were contributing
to the family income.

639
00:32:36.471 --> 00:32:38.301
♪ <i>You rockin' and you rockin'
and you rockin' around</i> ♪

640
00:32:38.335 --> 00:32:39.888
♪ <i>Hop. hop. hop everybody</i> ♪

641
00:32:39.923 --> 00:32:41.960
After World War II.

642
00:32:41.994 --> 00:32:43.547
the middle class exploded.

643
00:32:43.582 --> 00:32:45.135
Families could offer their kids

644
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.068
more leisure time.

645
00:32:47.103 --> 00:32:48.483
more independence.

646
00:32:48.518 --> 00:32:51.141
...the rock and roll
teenage cowboy.

647
00:32:51.176 --> 00:32:52.556
The American consumer economy

648
00:32:52.591 --> 00:32:55.490
was booming and it just became
the American way of life:

649
00:32:55.525 --> 00:32:58.666
spend money. buy things.
dress up. you know.

650
00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.943
move up the food chain.

651
00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:01.186
Gather 'round. kiddies.

652
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.258
Today I'm going to give you
a quick look-see

653
00:33:04.292 --> 00:33:06.605
at what the well-dressed teenager is doing

654
00:33:06.639 --> 00:33:08.262
in the way of fun and fashion.

655
00:33:08.296 --> 00:33:10.195
If teenagers decided to work.

656
00:33:10.229 --> 00:33:12.852
they could use that money
for their own benefit.

657
00:33:12.887 --> 00:33:13.853
for their own leisure time.

658
00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.616
They could buy their own cars.

659
00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:18.755
They bought their own records.

660
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:20.239
They sort of helped create rock and roll.

661
00:33:20.274 --> 00:33:22.483
Teenagers... they're terrific.

662
00:33:25.589 --> 00:33:27.074
Jeans got sort of

663
00:33:27.108 --> 00:33:30.284
irreparably linked

664
00:33:30.318 --> 00:33:32.182
with cool.

665
00:33:32.217 --> 00:33:36.255
And coolness became the ideal
to strive for.

666
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:39.086
Kay's
mother may have other opinions of style

667
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.639
of what looks best.

668
00:33:40.673 --> 00:33:44.022
But of course mother has
old-fashioned ideas.

669
00:33:44.056 --> 00:33:45.678
It's like. "What mom and dad want to do?

670
00:33:45.713 --> 00:33:47.577
"Oh my God.
I can't even talk to them.

671
00:33:47.611 --> 00:33:50.062
I do not want to wear
what they're wearing."

672
00:33:50.097 --> 00:33:52.133
The adolescent is self-centered.

673
00:33:52.168 --> 00:33:53.997
The charisma of deviance is powerful.

674
00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:57.932
Their sloppiness
is so deliberate as to be offensive.

675
00:34:00.728 --> 00:34:06.113
So during the
1950s. denim becomes increasingly

676
00:34:06.147 --> 00:34:11.532
associated with biker gangs
and juvenile delinquency.

677
00:34:11.566 --> 00:34:16.123
There was a sort of fear.
I think. among adults that

678
00:34:16.157 --> 00:34:17.676
if teenagers put on a pair of jeans.

679
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.644
they were automatically going
to become delinquents

680
00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:23.233
in some way.

681
00:34:23.268 --> 00:34:26.616
School systems
literally started banning blue jeans

682
00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:28.963
because they identified
the kids who wore them

683
00:34:28.997 --> 00:34:30.413
as the "bad seeds."

684
00:34:30.447 --> 00:34:32.898
They were going to. you know.
beat up a little old lady

685
00:34:32.932 --> 00:34:35.038
and steal her pocketbook or. or whatever.

686
00:34:37.592 --> 00:34:40.078
The parents'
generation started to clamp down.

687
00:34:40.112 --> 00:34:43.081
which caused a dip in sales.

688
00:34:43.115 --> 00:34:44.530
Suddenly families were

689
00:34:44.565 --> 00:34:46.222
shying away from buying blue jeans.

690
00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:51.158
The denim companies start to get worried.

691
00:34:51.192 --> 00:34:53.781
As a result. a lot of the major companies

692
00:34:53.815 --> 00:34:57.302
band together to form what
they called the Denim Council.

693
00:35:00.132 --> 00:35:02.928
More people than ever are wearing denim.

694
00:35:02.962 --> 00:35:05.517
You'd have to look far and wide
to find an American of any age

695
00:35:05.551 --> 00:35:07.381
who has never worn blue jeans.

696
00:35:07.415 --> 00:35:11.902
So they start this
whole campaign first to try to counter

697
00:35:11.937 --> 00:35:15.458
the "bad" blue jean look with
the "wholesome" blue jean look.

698
00:35:15.492 --> 00:35:18.254
"This is the right way to wear jeans."

699
00:35:18.288 --> 00:35:20.152
and it's neat with a nice shirt

700
00:35:20.187 --> 00:35:23.880
and this very kind of healthy-looking kid.

701
00:35:23.914 --> 00:35:25.399
And then.
"This is the bad blue jean."

702
00:35:25.433 --> 00:35:26.434
And so it's the more the kid

703
00:35:26.469 --> 00:35:28.609
like with his hair hanging down. greasy.

704
00:35:28.643 --> 00:35:29.610
and all that kind of stuff.

705
00:35:29.644 --> 00:35:31.301
Like. see?
There is a difference.

706
00:35:31.336 --> 00:35:33.614
You can be a good kid and wear blue jeans.

707
00:35:33.648 --> 00:35:35.616
Denim is really great for sports.

708
00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.721
Looks like this joker
is knocking himself out

709
00:35:37.756 --> 00:35:40.379
trying to prove it.

710
00:35:40.414 --> 00:35:43.417
Folks wear jeans to get the work done

711
00:35:43.451 --> 00:35:45.798
and jeans to relax in.

712
00:35:45.833 --> 00:35:47.490
They tried to create a National Denim Day.

713
00:35:47.524 --> 00:35:48.525
They had all sorts of

714
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.631
campaigns around the country

715
00:35:50.665 --> 00:35:56.257
which are all about
the discovery of America.

716
00:35:56.292 --> 00:35:57.362
They are about cowboys.

717
00:35:57.396 --> 00:36:00.503
they are about adventure.

718
00:36:00.537 --> 00:36:02.367
and history.

719
00:36:02.401 --> 00:36:05.059
Blue denim is
a symbol of our pioneering spirit.

720
00:36:05.093 --> 00:36:07.820
It goes right back
to the beginning of America.

721
00:36:07.855 --> 00:36:11.203
Men in blue denim opened up the old West.

722
00:36:11.238 --> 00:36:14.310
and built our bridges and skyscrapers.

723
00:36:14.344 --> 00:36:15.759
That series of advertisements

724
00:36:15.794 --> 00:36:19.729
helped reverse the trend
away from blue jeans.

725
00:36:19.763 --> 00:36:21.386
In the last few months

726
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.871
more applications for the
Peace Corps have come to us.

727
00:36:23.905 --> 00:36:26.425
By the first years of the 1960s.

728
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:29.808
the Peace Corps. JFK's initiative

729
00:36:29.842 --> 00:36:31.258
sending young Americans out
across the globe

730
00:36:31.292 --> 00:36:32.707
to do good deeds.

731
00:36:32.742 --> 00:36:35.296
they were actually dressed in blue jeans.

732
00:36:35.331 --> 00:36:37.125
That was their uniform.

733
00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.059
So no longer was it that

734
00:36:40.094 --> 00:36:42.027
the bad kids were the only ones
wearing blue jeans.

735
00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.033
One thing in particular
that's interesting about this period

736
00:36:48.067 --> 00:36:49.966
is the denim companies

737
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.349
spend all this time in the 1950s

738
00:36:53.383 --> 00:36:59.044
trying to get away from the rebel image

739
00:36:59.078 --> 00:37:02.565
and then the 1960s happens.

740
00:37:02.599 --> 00:37:05.223
Hippies
made a colorful scene with wild costumes.

741
00:37:05.257 --> 00:37:07.190
uninhibited dancing.
and general high frolicking.

742
00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:12.091
When we think about
the denim story in the 1960s.

743
00:37:12.126 --> 00:37:15.198
we almost automatically think
of the hippies.

744
00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:18.512
with their bellbottoms. and tie-dye.

745
00:37:18.546 --> 00:37:22.930
but the hippies weren't the only
people wearing those clothes.

746
00:37:22.964 --> 00:37:28.038
A man dies
when he refuses to stand up for justice.

747
00:37:28.073 --> 00:37:31.559
A man dies when he refuses to take a stand

748
00:37:31.594 --> 00:37:33.423
for that which is true.

749
00:37:33.458 --> 00:37:35.805
So we're going to stand up right here.

750
00:37:35.839 --> 00:37:38.428
The classic
image of the Civil Rights Movement

751
00:37:38.463 --> 00:37:41.362
is Martin Luther King Jr.

752
00:37:41.397 --> 00:37:46.505
and he and many of his closest partners

753
00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.785
wore suits and button down shirts.

754
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.718
sort of a "Sunday best" approach.

755
00:37:52.753 --> 00:37:54.858
We will be able to join hands

756
00:37:54.893 --> 00:37:57.413
and sing in the words
of the old Negro spiritual.

757
00:37:57.447 --> 00:38:00.312
free at last. free at last.

758
00:38:00.347 --> 00:38:02.935
thank God Almighty we are free at last.

759
00:38:04.868 --> 00:38:06.456
Being a man of African descent.

760
00:38:06.491 --> 00:38:10.495
a lot hinged on his self-representation.

761
00:38:10.529 --> 00:38:11.737
He needed to present himself to the world

762
00:38:11.772 --> 00:38:13.636
as a respectable person.

763
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.223
because there was already
a notch against him

764
00:38:15.258 --> 00:38:16.328
for being a Black man.

765
00:38:18.641 --> 00:38:21.299
The focus on the Sunday best

766
00:38:21.333 --> 00:38:26.096
has obscured the fact that
at that time there were

767
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:29.479
these young college students who say.

768
00:38:29.514 --> 00:38:32.240
"Instead. we're going to wear
denim because we want to show

769
00:38:32.275 --> 00:38:35.347
"that our political bonds
are to the Black working poor

770
00:38:35.382 --> 00:38:37.970
and not to the Black bourgeois."

771
00:38:39.455 --> 00:38:43.321
These young people. once they
left Howard University.

772
00:38:43.355 --> 00:38:48.671
Fisk University.
Tougaloo College. to head south.

773
00:38:48.705 --> 00:38:51.432
say. "We're going to wear
this denim alongside

774
00:38:51.467 --> 00:38:54.711
"the working class and
sharecroppers who had been

775
00:38:54.746 --> 00:38:56.679
"trying for decades

776
00:38:56.713 --> 00:38:59.578
to fight for their right
to vote."

777
00:38:59.613 --> 00:39:03.064
They were rebels with a cause.

778

♪ <i>Freedom</i> ♪

779
00:39:06.896 --> 00:39:09.208

♪ <i>Freedom. freedom.</i> ♪

781
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.249
For young Black
protesters. it absolutely is risky

782
00:39:15.283 --> 00:39:16.975
with what they're wearing

783
00:39:17.009 --> 00:39:20.219
because they already have
the systemic pressure

784
00:39:20.254 --> 00:39:23.395
up against them presuming that they are

785
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.432
of a lower class or status in society.

786
00:39:25.466 --> 00:39:29.090
And so wearing a certain style
of dress that is aligned

787
00:39:29.125 --> 00:39:30.368
with the laboring class.

788
00:39:30.402 --> 00:39:32.680

national media attention.

793
00:39:42.103 --> 00:39:46.418
you now have white students
who decide to go south

794
00:39:46.453 --> 00:39:48.316
to help with the organizing.

795
00:39:48.351 --> 00:39:52.873
♪ <i>We are all here. Black and white</i> ♪

796
00:39:52.907 --> 00:39:56.359
So when those
white students go back north.

797
00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:58.706
they go back wearing denim.

798
00:39:58.741 --> 00:40:01.606
♪ <i>Hold on. hold on.</i> ♪

799
00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.505
This becomes the look of youth rebellion

800
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.920
in the 1960s.

801
00:40:13.825 --> 00:40:17.207
♪ <i>Baby. don't call me a liar</i> ♪

802
00:40:17.242 --> 00:40:20.452
They represent
a new form of social rebellion.

803
00:40:20.487 --> 00:40:23.628
They dress in bizarre and colorful ways.

804
00:40:23.662 --> 00:40:25.215
Hippies are very interesting...

805
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.529
The 1960s is a
pivotal point in the history of denim.

806
00:40:28.564 --> 00:40:30.531
They are hip. onto something good.

807
00:40:30.566 --> 00:40:32.257
Just like for the Civil Rights Movement.

808
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:34.328
for the hippies.

809
00:40:34.362 --> 00:40:37.642
clothing was a form of political activism.

810
00:40:37.676 --> 00:40:39.298
Of course it's a
whole different way of living.

811
00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:40.472
it's a whole different way of thinking.

812
00:40:40.507 --> 00:40:45.166
So many of the civilians have no concept.

813
00:40:45.201 --> 00:40:46.236
But it's fun.

814
00:40:46.271 --> 00:40:47.893
It's fun to be bizarre.

815
00:40:47.928 --> 00:40:51.138
There was
such an emphasis with the counterculture

816
00:40:51.172 --> 00:40:53.243
on creativity. on individuality.

817
00:40:53.278 --> 00:40:55.453
self-expression.

818
00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.493
People then embellished their jeans.

819
00:41:01.528 --> 00:41:04.565
They sewed fringe on them...

820
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.842
They put feathers.

821
00:41:05.877 --> 00:41:07.810
They were patched...
-Painted...

822
00:41:07.844 --> 00:41:10.468
Embroidered and shredded...

823
00:41:10.502 --> 00:41:11.745
All of the sudden your jeans

824
00:41:11.779 --> 00:41:13.747
were your canvases.

825
00:41:16.784 --> 00:41:18.510
There was a cool factor.

826
00:41:18.545 --> 00:41:22.790
And when rock stars and
musicians started wearing denim.

827
00:41:22.825 --> 00:41:24.896
it became even cooler.

828
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:27.761
There was The Who. and Janis Joplin.

829
00:41:27.795 --> 00:41:33.525
and the Doors. the Rolling
Stones. Led Zeppelin.

830
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.940
So then everyone wanted to wear them.

831
00:41:34.975 --> 00:41:39.151
♪ <i>By the time we got to Woodstock</i> ♪

832
00:41:39.186 --> 00:41:40.774
"Woodstock"... that movie

833
00:41:40.808 --> 00:41:44.812
completely expanded our idea of fashion.

834
00:41:44.847 --> 00:41:47.125
I know for me being this kid
in North Carolina.

835
00:41:47.159 --> 00:41:49.161
when I saw that movie. I'm like.

836
00:41:49.196 --> 00:41:52.268
"I want to
wear clothes like that."

837
00:41:52.302 --> 00:41:54.512
♪ <i>A little help
from my friends</i> ♪

838
00:41:56.065 --> 00:41:59.862
Denim was the uniform of that generation.

839
00:41:59.896 --> 00:42:02.520
and a lot of the denim companies

840
00:42:02.554 --> 00:42:04.107
started to capitalize on that.

841
00:42:05.971 --> 00:42:08.698
It's interesting
to look at that case study of Levi's.

842
00:42:08.733 --> 00:42:13.496
because in the 1950s
they tried so hard to get away

843
00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:15.740
from the counterculture.

844
00:42:15.774 --> 00:42:17.845
And then by 1971.

845
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.676
they use an aerial shot of the crowd

846
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.988
at a music festival

847
00:42:23.023 --> 00:42:28.235
and just slap a Levi's logo
on it. and that's it!

848
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.245
It's been said
that "Those children of the '60s

849
00:42:38.279 --> 00:42:44.009
came in as a tribe
and went out as a market."

850
00:42:44.044 --> 00:42:46.011
They were the market for blue jeans.

851
00:42:51.707 --> 00:42:54.192
By the time you get into the early '70s.

852
00:42:54.226 --> 00:42:57.298
hippie chic is everywhere.

853
00:42:57.333 --> 00:43:01.682
The fashion industry becomes wildly taken

854
00:43:01.717 --> 00:43:04.616
with these young radicals.

855
00:43:04.651 --> 00:43:08.965
You have designers with ads
that suggested that.

856
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.210
"The real freedom movement
is in your jeans."

857
00:43:14.074 --> 00:43:15.627
It is ironic. isn't it?

858
00:43:15.662 --> 00:43:17.595
Rewind like a decade earlier.

859
00:43:17.629 --> 00:43:20.667
youth were sort of wearing denim
as a form of rebellion.

860
00:43:20.701 --> 00:43:24.636
By the time we get to the 1970s.
like denim is being commodified.

861
00:43:26.673 --> 00:43:27.984
The fashion industry co-opts

862
00:43:28.019 --> 00:43:31.229
authentic subcultural styles

863
00:43:31.263 --> 00:43:33.956
and then makes them part of the system.

864
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:38.616
Whether it seems dangerous
or seems totally trivial.

865
00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:42.758
the fashion industry takes any
cool look or stance

866
00:43:42.792 --> 00:43:46.071
and markets it if sees an audience for it.

867
00:43:48.108 --> 00:43:51.318
We start to see
denim jeans become just a very

868
00:43:51.352 --> 00:43:52.802
lucrative product.

869
00:43:52.837 --> 00:43:56.841
They were really a great blank canvas

870
00:43:56.875 --> 00:43:58.774
for designers to express themselves.

871
00:44:00.948 --> 00:44:03.295
When I was 16 years old.

872
00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:06.333
I was enamored with music and musicians.

873
00:44:06.367 --> 00:44:10.164
and I couldn't play
so I couldn't be a musician.

874
00:44:10.199 --> 00:44:11.994
but I wanted to look like a rock star.

875
00:44:12.028 --> 00:44:17.344
So I opened a small shop
called People's Place

876
00:44:17.378 --> 00:44:18.863
and started selling jeans.

877
00:44:18.897 --> 00:44:22.314
At one point I was thinking.
"I think I could design

878
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:25.386
better jeans than we're buying
from vendors."

879
00:44:27.078 --> 00:44:29.080
The fashion industry realizes

880
00:44:29.114 --> 00:44:31.496
that there's this massive market

881
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:33.705
for all things denim.

882
00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:38.296
Now it's sleek. high-rise. tight...

883
00:44:40.678 --> 00:44:44.129
There becomes a certain kind of
glamor associated with jeans

884
00:44:44.164 --> 00:44:45.303
for the first time.

885
00:44:47.477 --> 00:44:48.824
It was a turning point.

886
00:44:48.858 --> 00:44:51.792
which became the era of designer jeans.

887
00:44:51.827 --> 00:44:54.657
There was Gloria Vanderbilt.

888
00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:55.969
Calvin Klein...

889
00:44:56.003 --> 00:44:57.729

-Sergio Valente...

891
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.734
We were really trying to outdo

one another with sexiness.

893
00:45:08.464 --> 00:45:11.881
But when Brooke Shields. as a young teen.

894
00:45:11.916 --> 00:45:16.852
was the Calvin Klein poster
girl. I think heads turned.

895

at the fashion hierarchy.

They make it acceptable for anyone

910

Jeans undermine the idea
of what fashion was supposed to be.

911

They were part of a more general
democratization of fashion.

00:46:10.388 --> 00:46:13.218

To get your hands

is subversive in a way.

972
00:48:47.027 --> 00:48:49.271
Because it is saying. "I'm not

974

Jeans are probably
the single most iconic garment

980
00:49:24.064 --> 00:49:26.308
of the 20th century.

981
00:49:26.342 --> 00:49:27.757
Each generation

982
00:49:27.792 --> 00:49:31.485
keeps rediscovering how jeans
can be meaningful for them.

983
00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:43.532
Blue jeans are an amazing thing

984
00:49:43.566 --> 00:49:44.740
for anyone trying to tell

985
00:49:44.774 --> 00:49:47.985
a broader history of the United States.

986
00:49:48.019 --> 00:49:50.194
It allows you to talk about slavery.

987
00:49:50.228 --> 00:49:54.853
It allows you to talk about
fashion and consumerism.

988
00:49:54.888 --> 00:49:57.580
It allows you to talk about cool
and the invention of cool.

989
00:49:57.615 --> 00:50:01.412
And to have all of these things
under the same heading

990
00:50:01.446 --> 00:50:02.965
is really quite remarkable.

991
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:10.731
Denim and its
history is a perfect metaphor

992
00:50:10.766 --> 00:50:16.530
for where we find ourselves
as a culture right now.

993
00:50:16.565 --> 00:50:21.225
Becoming much more aware of the silences.

994
00:50:21.259 --> 00:50:25.229
of those groups

995
00:50:25.263 --> 00:50:28.922
that have been pushed to the side.

996
00:50:28.956 --> 00:50:32.857

997
00:50:32.891 --> 00:50:35.653
these narratives that haven't made it into

998
00:50:35.687 --> 00:50:39.691
that typical telling of jeans

999
00:50:39.726 --> 00:50:43.247
is part of the work to change
our understanding

1000
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:44.627
of American history.

1001
00:50:50.081 --> 00:50:53.705
It's a long journey from "Negro cloth"

1002
00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:58.607
to hip hop denim and baggy jeans
ruling the denim market

1003
00:50:58.641 --> 00:51:01.230
in the 1990s.

1004
00:51:01.265 --> 00:51:05.510
As I sit here in a denim jacket.
you know. it's clear to me that

1005
00:51:05.545 --> 00:51:09.307
we can see the rich tapestry
of where we've been as a people.

1006
00:51:09.342 --> 00:51:13.208
as a nation.

1007
00:51:16.383 --> 00:51:17.591
The thing about the denim jean

1008
00:51:17.626 --> 00:51:21.147
is it tells a story about who we are.

1009
00:51:21.181 --> 00:51:24.702
It's a garment that's almost
like keeping the fingerprints

1010
00:51:24.736 --> 00:51:26.393
of our history...

1011
00:51:26.428 --> 00:51:30.880
the creases. the tears. all of it.

1012
00:51:30.915 --> 00:51:32.192
You know. you can repair it all you want.

1013
00:51:32.227 --> 00:51:35.471
mend it all you want.
but the scars of that. you know.

1014
00:51:35.506 --> 00:51:37.508
the memory. that material memory

1015
00:51:37.542 --> 00:51:38.923
will remain there.
