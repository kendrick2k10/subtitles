-[Mary] I was always told that
every story has two sides.

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:31.083
But for my mama. grandma
and me...

7
00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:33.000
there were three.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.750
And they all led to
what would become

9
00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:37.167

-You think I wouldn't find out
what really happened?

16

-[Ella] Oh for the love
of God. Willard.

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:17.125
Now I can't trust this slut
to take care of my Jeep.

-[Ella] Mary...

21
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.833

-[Veronica] No. you got things
twisted.

28
00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:29.917
-[Willard] Now enough
with the lies!

29
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.167
-[Veronica] I'm not lying.
Please.

30

are saying

31

when I was on my trucking runs.

37
00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:45.667

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:16.292
-Just give me a minute.

51
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.958
-Mama?

52
00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:21.333

I just shot my husband.

62
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.125

To the back.

68
00:03:19.542 --> 00:03:20.417
Go.

69
00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:21.417
Where's the vic?

70
00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:22.125
-Please. we're not
the ones who...

71
00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:23.625
-Was this weapon used tonight?

72
00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:26.958
-Got a body.

73
00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.167
-Call it in.

74
00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:29.708
Was that rifle used tonight?

75
00:03:30.708 --> 00:03:34.292
-She can't hear you.
She's deaf in one ear.

76
00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:37.917
-Who are you?

77
00:03:38.042 --> 00:03:40.583
-I'm... I'm the one
who called 911.

78
00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:41.542
Took you long enough.

79
00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:43.250
I've been out trying to get help
from a neighbor.

80
00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:48.000
It's okay. Mary.
Mama's here.

81
00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:49.458
-You called 911?

82
00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:53.417
-Only I didn't tell
everything true.

83
00:03:57.708 --> 00:03:59.167
It wasn't me who shot
my husband.

84
00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:00.708
it was my daughter. Mary.

85
00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:05.833
-No.

86
00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:09.000

[background conversation]

89
00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:30.792
-It ain't right they're not
in a holding cell.

90
00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:34.500
-Why don't you find out
if we got a corpse first?

91
00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:35.750
Go check with the doctor.

92
00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:39.625
-Willard's my husband
so shouldn't I be knowing

93
00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:40.750
what's going on around here?

94
00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:41.875
-Veronica.

95
00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:42.667
-What?

96
00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:46.417
These cops don't fool me
with their fake concern.

97
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.458
Ain't nobody came to our rescue
for all these years

98
00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:50.208
which is exactly why we had...

99
00:04:50.292 --> 00:04:53.542
-Why you had to what?
Veronica?

100
00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:54.500
-Sheriff.

101
00:04:55.542 --> 00:04:59.958
Victim didn't make it.
Willard Simms is dead.

102
00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:00.625
-[Ella sighs]

103
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.875
-Let's move these three
down to the station.

104
00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:09.208
-I told you it wasn't me
who shot my husband.

105
00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:12.250
-Sheriff ordered gunshot residue
tests for all three of you.

106
00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:13.917
-All three?

107
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.042
-You ain't gonna find nothing.

108
00:05:26.208 --> 00:05:27.458
-Who's next?

109
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.583
Next.

110
00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:43.750
-Mama?

111
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.417
-You got nothing to worry about.
Mary.

112
00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:09.583
[dramatic music intensifies]

113
00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:12.708
-Okay. thanks.

114
00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:15.750
And?

115
00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:18.417
-Two of them handled the rifle
that killed Willard Simms.

116
00:06:20.292 --> 00:06:21.625
-[sighs]

117
00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:24.000
Which means two
different explanations.

118
00:06:28.542 --> 00:06:29.917
-You're free to go.

119
00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.042
-I'm arresting you for
the murder of Willard Simms.

120
00:06:46.542 --> 00:06:47.917
-I wanna sue for
false imprisonment.

121
00:06:47.917 --> 00:06:49.583
-You have the right
to remain silent.

122
00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:51.500
Anything you say can and will be
used against you

123
00:06:51.583 --> 00:06:52.958
in a court of law.

124
00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:57.625
-Do we get to go home now?

125
00:06:58.458 --> 00:06:59.750
-Not exactly.

126
00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:07.083
-I told you... Mary's
the one who done it.

127
00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:08.250
-Mary.
-Mama.

128
00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:11.708
-Don't worry. Mary.
I'm gonna tell ´em everything.

129
00:07:11.792 --> 00:07:13.000
-I wanna tell everything too.

130
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.875
-You shouldn't say anything
until you've been assigned

131
00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:16.542
a court appointed attorney.

132
00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:18.667
-That the same as a lawyer?

133
00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:23.000
-It's exactly the same. Mary.
I'm here for your benefit.

134
00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:25.833
To see you through the upcoming
trial and its outcome.

135
00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:29.333
-Why do I need a... court
appointed attorney

136
00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:30.708
if I already know
to tell the truth?

137
00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:32.667
-Well that's the thing. Mary.

138
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.500
I already told them.
you're not gonna testify.

139
00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:36.667
You're not even gonna be
in the courtroom.

140
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.500
-What? I was there
when Willard was shot.

141
00:07:41.583 --> 00:07:45.208
-I'm gonna suggest
that you never repeat that.

142
00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:49.875
-No one knows what happened
the way that I do.

143
00:07:52.333 --> 00:07:55.542
I'm the one been living
this nightmare for 10 years.

144
00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:57.292
-It's important for
everyone concerned.

145
00:07:57.375 --> 00:08:00.542
including the deceased.
that you share every detail.

146
00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:04.000
We need to know not only
who killed Willard Simms

147
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.917
but also the events that led up
to his shooting.

148
00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:12.542
Don't be afraid. Veronica.
Tell us everything.

149
00:08:13.417 --> 00:08:18.250
-Who's the most beautiful baby
girl in the whole wide world?

150
00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:19.708
You are. Mary Bailey.

151
00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.792
I'm gonna make sure you
don't want for nothing.

152
00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:24.042
-That mean you're gonna
start helping

153
00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:25.875
with expenses around here?

154
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.875
-You know I'd do anything
for my baby girl. Mama.

155
00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.375
-Except get her father
to leave his wife

156
00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:30.917
and admit that Mary's his baby.

157
00:08:30.917 --> 00:08:33.417
-I told you I know what I did
was sin.

158
00:08:33.542 --> 00:08:35.708
That don't make Mary one.
Look at her.

159
00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:39.375
I'm gonna find Mary
a new daddy.

160
00:08:39.375 --> 00:08:41.708
A man who takes pride
in family.

161
00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.875
-Ain't no such thing
in this god forsaken town.

162
00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:46.750
-There you are!

163
00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:49.000
I'll figure something out Mama.
you'll see.

164
00:08:49.042 --> 00:08:52.500
For you. for me...
and especially for Mary.

165
00:08:52.542 --> 00:08:54.708
-You still got some growing up
to do. Veronica.

166
00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:57.875
Just try to do it with the right
kind of people this time.

167
00:08:57.875 --> 00:08:59.833
-Just seems like being
a volunteer counselor

168
00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:02.375
at church summer camp's
a good place to start.

169
00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.958
-Maybe.

170
00:09:04.042 --> 00:09:07.500
But if anybody could screw
that up it'd be you.

171
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.000
Whatever you do
when you grow up...

172
00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:11.667
don't end up like her.

173
00:09:13.042 --> 00:09:15.083
[baby crying]

174
00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:19.625
-And now we'll head downstairs

175
00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:21.625
and I'll show you the rooms
for arts and crafts

176
00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:23.917
and indoor play when
the weather's not so nice.

177
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.208
And Veronica. I'll pair you
with this young man.

178
00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:37.292
I'll leave you both to it then.
Be good now.

179
00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:38.583
-Hold on a sec.

180
00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:42.833
Well that's better.

181
00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:46.625
Um... I'm Willard.
Willard Simms.

182
00:09:46.708 --> 00:09:48.375
-Hi.
-Hi.

183
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.208
I'm Veronica Bailey.

184
00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:53.625
-Do you believe in destiny
Veronica Bailey?

185
00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:54.750
-[laughs]
What?

186
00:09:55.083 --> 00:09:57.458
-You know. when two people
are meant to be as one?

187
00:09:57.542 --> 00:09:59.167
-Are you for real?

188
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.250
-Why do you ask?
Do I seem too good to be true?

189
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.917
[both laugh]

190
00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:10.292
-Do we have to bring baby Mary
with us everywhere we go?

191
00:10:10.292 --> 00:10:12.583
-You'll understand one day
when you have a baby.

192
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.542
Ain't nothing like it. Susan.

193
00:10:15.542 --> 00:10:16.542
-Count me out.

194
00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:18.083
I'm gonna move away
and never look back

195
00:10:18.208 --> 00:10:20.667
once I find me someone
who's as old as he is rich.

196
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.542
-Better off relying on ourselves
than any man.

197
00:10:23.542 --> 00:10:25.667
-Well. don't that depend
on the man?

198
00:10:28.417 --> 00:10:29.917
-Not polite to eavesdrop.

199
00:10:30.042 --> 00:10:30.667
-Hi Willard.

200
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.833
-I wasn't eavesdropping.
just passing by.

201
00:10:33.917 --> 00:10:36.000
You on your way to the bakery?

202
00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:37.125
-Maybe.

203
00:10:39.083 --> 00:10:40.583
-Well whatever you're having.

204
00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:42.333
whatever you want.
it's my treat.

205
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.917
Not used to people being nice
to you. taking care of you?

206
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.042
It's time you realize

207
00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:51.833
how special you are.
Veronica Bailey.

208
00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:53.542
I'm the one who's gonna make
sure of it.

209
00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:55.375
Ain't that right.
sweet little Mary?

210
00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:00.250
See you there. ladies.

211
00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:05.667
-What happened to not relying
on any man?

212
00:11:12.458 --> 00:11:14.583
[upbeat music]

213
00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:16.083
[women giggling]

214
00:11:16.083 --> 00:11:17.083
-Ma went to
Sears portrait studio

215
00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:19.833
to take photos of her
and the baby.

216
00:11:19.833 --> 00:11:22.042
She's gotten kinda possessive
with Mary.

217
00:11:22.667 --> 00:11:24.292
-I told you that's a good thing.

218
00:11:25.583 --> 00:11:26.917
-Hi Willard.

219
00:11:29.875 --> 00:11:33.792
-Now you are too young
and beautiful to have a kid.

220
00:11:33.875 --> 00:11:35.542
-Didn't Pastor McCall say
no fraternizing

221
00:11:35.667 --> 00:11:37.750
between camp counselors?

222
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.458
-He also said no drinking.

223
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.833
Oh. Can I get an amen?

224
00:11:43.875 --> 00:11:45.333
-[crowd in unison]
Amen!

225
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.667
-I. uh... thought I asked you

226
00:11:54.667 --> 00:11:57.375
to stop telling everyone
you got a kid.

227
00:11:57.375 --> 00:11:58.833
-Well. those are my friends.

228
00:11:58.917 --> 00:12:00.333
They spend plenty of time
with Mary.

229
00:12:00.458 --> 00:12:02.708
My baby will never be
no dirty little secret.

230
00:12:02.708 --> 00:12:05.167
I'm proud to be her mama.

231
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.917
-So you're okay with people
thinking you're a slut?

232
00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:12.000
It's what I hear other people
saying. that's all.

233
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.792
I only wanna protect you.

234
00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:20.875
-Got a funny way
of showing it sometimes.

235
00:12:24.292 --> 00:12:25.500
Damn. you're beautiful.

236
00:12:27.583 --> 00:12:29.958
Here. take a sip.

237
00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:31.667
-You know I'm not old enough.

238
00:12:31.875 --> 00:12:34.208
-Don't you trust me to know
what's best for you?

239
00:12:42.542 --> 00:12:43.958
-You really take a drink.

240
00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:46.125
Hey Todd!

241
00:12:46.208 --> 00:12:47.375
-Hey!

242
00:12:49.042 --> 00:12:51.875
Hey. Listen dude.
I'm. like... drunk as a skunk.

243
00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:52.917
[laughs]

244
00:12:52.917 --> 00:12:55.167
-Do me a favor
and kiss Veronica.

245
00:12:55.292 --> 00:12:56.083
-Huh?

246
00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:56.708
-What?

247
00:12:56.833 --> 00:12:57.917
-[chuckles]

248
00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.375
-Yeah. tell me if you can taste
the booze on her lips.

249
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.458
Or her tongue.

250
00:13:03.292 --> 00:13:04.292
-For real?

251
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.125
-Willard.

252
00:13:07.792 --> 00:13:09.417
-I mean. I'm... I'm willing
if you are.

253
00:13:09.542 --> 00:13:10.500
[chuckles]

254
00:13:11.542 --> 00:13:12.458
[blow thuds]

255
00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.625
-What are you doing?!

256
00:13:14.708 --> 00:13:16.333
-Proving I always got your back.

257
00:13:23.542 --> 00:13:24.333
Veronica.

258
00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:29.000
[car door shuts]

259
00:13:29.083 --> 00:13:30.250
[Willard] At least let me
apologize.

260
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.042
-[sniffs]

261
00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:35.542
-The way I was acting was...

262
00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:36.792
-What?

263
00:13:39.625 --> 00:13:41.458
Willard. wait.

264
00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.708
-Are you shaking?

265
00:13:44.792 --> 00:13:49.333
-What happened with Todd...
it scares me.

266
00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:50.750
-I would never do...

267
00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:52.375
-But I've already been
with one bad man.

268
00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:54.042
I can't make the same
mistake twice.

269
00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:55.875
Not now that I got Mary.

270
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.625
-Is that what you think I am?

271
00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:00.917
A bad man?

272
00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:06.250
Well you got my parents
to thank for messing me up.

273
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.250
Drinking.

274
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.667
Fighting.

275
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:09.833
Punching.

276
00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:14.083
You know. I swore I'd never be
like them. but...

277
00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:15.917
I guess the more you try
to run away from something

278
00:14:15.917 --> 00:14:17.625
the faster it catches up to you.

279
00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:23.375
-Willard. wait.

280
00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:30.375
I guess...

281
00:14:30.458 --> 00:14:33.458
I don't really have the best
track record myself.

282
00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:41.125
Dating a married man and having
a baby nobody wants but me.

283
00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:46.833
My mama reminds me all the time
of what a mess-up I am.

284
00:14:46.875 --> 00:14:50.125
-Don't you ever say that again.
Veronica.

285
00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:52.167
There's nothing about you
that's messed up.

286
00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:56.000
Don't you see this is why
I wanna protect you?

287
00:14:57.625 --> 00:14:59.167
I wanna be with you forever.

288
00:15:00.792 --> 00:15:01.875
You are the only one
on this earth

289
00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.542
who can save me from myself.

290
00:15:05.542 --> 00:15:06.167
[door opens]

291
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.667
-Veronica! Do you know
what time it is?

292
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.042
You never fail to disappoint.

293
00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:13.208
-You got the wrong idea about
what's going on out here. ma'am.

294
00:15:13.292 --> 00:15:14.792
-I know what boys your age
are interested in.

295
00:15:14.875 --> 00:15:16.000
especially when it comes
to girls

296
00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:17.333
who ain't got no moral compass.

297
00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:18.167
-Mama!

298
00:15:18.458 --> 00:15:20.292
-Way past your bedtime.
Veronica Bailey.

299
00:15:22.042 --> 00:15:24.333
Do yourself a favor and steer
clear of my daughter.

300
00:15:24.417 --> 00:15:26.917
Ain't no good's come to anyone
who's ever known her.

301
00:15:29.833 --> 00:15:30.917
Let's go.

302
00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:39.333
[door slams shut]

303
00:15:48.125 --> 00:15:50.958
-Hi. I'm picking up a cake
for Veronica Bailey.

304
00:15:56.542 --> 00:15:57.500
-Coming up short?

305
00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:00.208
-Willard.

306
00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.083
-So you do remember my name.

307
00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:06.000
Now I've seen you around town
lots over the past year

308
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.958
but you don't even
as much as say hi.

309
00:16:08.042 --> 00:16:09.208
-Well my mama. she...

310
00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:14.542
Besides. I heard you moved on
and got married.

311
00:16:14.542 --> 00:16:16.708
-As if moving on is even
possible after meeting someone

312
00:16:16.708 --> 00:16:17.958
as amazing as you.

313
00:16:20.208 --> 00:16:22.250
What are the balloons
for anyway?

314
00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:25.625
-Oh. I got ´em
for Mary's birthday.

315
00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:29.667
I was trying to get
a cake too.

316
00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:33.667
-Will this cover it?

317
00:16:37.167 --> 00:16:38.958
-Heard you's about
to be a daddy.

318
00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:42.625
-Ever hear of someone
trying to mend a broken heart?

319
00:16:42.708 --> 00:16:46.292
-By getting my former
best friend. Susan. pregnant?

320
00:16:46.292 --> 00:16:47.417
-I'd leave her in an instant

321
00:16:47.542 --> 00:16:50.750
if it meant we'd be
together again.

322
00:16:50.833 --> 00:16:55.542
I don't care what your mama says
or Susan or anyone else neither.

323
00:16:55.625 --> 00:16:57.125
I'm in it for you and me.

324
00:16:58.667 --> 00:16:59.708
-And Mary?

325
00:16:59.833 --> 00:17:00.792
-[chuckles]

326
00:17:01.042 --> 00:17:03.875
I'm trying to buy her a cake.
ain't I?

327
00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.500
-I don't know. Willard.

328
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.333
Who says we're not wrong
for each other

329
00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:11.125
after what happened last year
at church?

330
00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:16.208
-I apologized for that.
I even made up with Todd.

331
00:17:16.292 --> 00:17:20.167
You forget you're the only one
who can save me from myself.

332
00:17:24.375 --> 00:17:30.333
-I. Veronica Jo Bailey.
take thee Willard Simms

333
00:17:30.375 --> 00:17:32.542
to be my lawfully
wedded husband.

334
00:17:32.542 --> 00:17:35.417
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

335
00:17:35.417 --> 00:17:39.292
for better. for worse.
for richer. for poorer.

336
00:17:39.375 --> 00:17:42.667
in sickness and in health.
to love and to cherish...

337
00:17:45.625 --> 00:17:46.667
No wait. I remember.

338
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.250
[both chuckle]

339
00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:52.333
To love and to cherish
´till death do us part.

340
00:17:57.083 --> 00:18:00.250
-I can't say that Willard
wasn't trying.

341
00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:02.417
Um... keeping us fed.

342
00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:05.750
Paying the bills.

343
00:18:07.208 --> 00:18:08.792
Making me feel protected.

344
00:18:09.833 --> 00:18:13.583
He was doing little things
to show his affection.

345
00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:15.500
-For me?
-Yeah.

346
00:18:15.667 --> 00:18:20.958
-But... Willard...
he had another side.

347
00:18:21.042 --> 00:18:23.667
One that would show up
without warning.

348
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.250
He blamed it on overreacting
when he was scared

349
00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:29.625
on account of him being abused
when he was little.

350
00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:35.250
Willard always promised
to do better.

351
00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:38.458
That. uh... that he was
gonna change.

352
00:18:38.542 --> 00:18:41.917
And I prayed on it.
I hoped on it.

353
00:18:42.042 --> 00:18:43.125
I committed myself to it

354
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.500
because of the wedding vows
I took in front of God.

355
00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:50.042
But... Willard's promises

356
00:18:50.042 --> 00:18:52.583
never seemed to take
for very long.

357
00:18:52.708 --> 00:18:53.667
-Mama?

358
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.583
-Oh Mary. Hi.

359
00:18:59.042 --> 00:19:00.167
Hi Mama.

360
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.208
-Do something to deserve
that shiner?

361
00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:04.083
-Nobody deserves
to be beat. Mama.

362
00:19:04.208 --> 00:19:05.375
Not even me.

363
00:19:05.375 --> 00:19:06.667
We watch what we say
around Mary.

364
00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:07.583
-Well here's an idea.

365
00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:09.333
Why don't you take her to live
with you and Willard

366
00:19:09.458 --> 00:19:11.333
so I don't have to raise
her anymore?

367
00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:13.458
-You know there's not
enough room at Willard's.

368
00:19:13.458 --> 00:19:15.833
It's not always safe for Mary
to be around him.

369
00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:16.958
Hey. you know what?

370
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.625
Why don't we pick out
your favorite color

371
00:19:18.708 --> 00:19:19.958
and we can paint
each other's nails?

372
00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:20.917
-Mm-hmm.

373
00:19:22.708 --> 00:19:23.750
-[gasps]

374
00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:25.500
Red's my favorite color too.

375
00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:27.833
Why don't you wait for me
downstairs. okay?

376
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.250
-Okay.
-Okay.

377
00:19:32.417 --> 00:19:33.625
Mary's here for her own safety

378
00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:35.208
'till I can find a way
to leave Willard

379
00:19:35.292 --> 00:19:37.167
so that he doesn't maybe
come after me or Mary

380
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.542
or... or even you.

381
00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:41.333
-Willard Simms don't scare me.

382
00:19:41.333 --> 00:19:43.208
What I do find frightening
is that a child I raised

383
00:19:43.292 --> 00:19:45.750
would grow up to be like you.

384
00:19:45.875 --> 00:19:46.917
[sighs]

385
00:19:47.208 --> 00:19:48.583
Turns out I'm not the only
one who's disappointed

386
00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:50.542
in the kind of person
you turned out to be.

387
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.625
-Nothing a little nail polish
can't fix. Right?

388
00:19:58.708 --> 00:19:59.792
-Pretty.

389
00:19:59.875 --> 00:20:01.583
-Yes you are. Mary Bailey.

390
00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:06.792
Don't you ever forget how much
I love you. Okay?

391
00:20:06.875 --> 00:20:10.750
Don't forget that one day...
we're gonna be together.

392
00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:12.917
-Yeah?

393
00:20:13.042 --> 00:20:15.125
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

394
00:20:15.208 --> 00:20:18.083
Safe and happy
without anyone telling us

395
00:20:18.167 --> 00:20:20.000
how to live our lives.

396
00:20:20.083 --> 00:20:23.292
It's just you and me. baby girl.
That's all that matters.

397
00:20:23.375 --> 00:20:25.333
There we go.

398
00:20:25.375 --> 00:20:26.333
[intense dramatic music]

399
00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:32.958
-Admit it.
You're trying to cut me out.

400
00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:34.667
-Out of what exactly?

401
00:20:34.708 --> 00:20:37.167
Mary... she misses
living with me.

402
00:20:37.208 --> 00:20:38.875
I was just trying to show her
some love.

403
00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:40.250
-Yeah. what about me?

404
00:20:41.917 --> 00:20:43.375
I mean. don't I deserve love?

405
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.583
-I wish you knew how much
I had for you.

406
00:20:48.583 --> 00:20:50.375
Mary'll love you too
if you let her.

407
00:20:53.375 --> 00:20:56.000
-Maybe we start thinking
about giving Mary a brother...

408
00:20:56.083 --> 00:20:57.875
or sister.

409
00:20:57.958 --> 00:20:59.542
-Yeah. one day. Sure.

410
00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:01.667
-Come on. there's no time
like the present.

411
00:21:01.667 --> 00:21:02.625
-I'm cooking.

412
00:21:02.708 --> 00:21:03.792
-Mmm.

413
00:21:03.875 --> 00:21:06.250
Come on baby.
we'll prove our love.

414
00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:08.292
To Mary. your mama.

415
00:21:08.292 --> 00:21:09.292
-Willard...

416
00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:11.167
-The whole damn world.

417
00:21:11.708 --> 00:21:15.167
-Please Willard. not like this.
No. not this way.

418
00:21:15.208 --> 00:21:16.542
Please don't do this.

419
00:21:16.625 --> 00:21:18.125
-Come on baby. prove our love.
You and me.

420
00:21:18.208 --> 00:21:19.250
-Stop. Please stop.

421
00:21:21.542 --> 00:21:22.542
-What you described.

422
00:21:22.875 --> 00:21:26.042
is that how you became pregnant
with Mary's brother?

423
00:21:26.042 --> 00:21:28.667
-Mary's half brother. Sammy.

424
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:34.833
His conception was...
no act of love but. still...

425
00:21:38.417 --> 00:21:42.958
Love was all I had for my
new baby boy once he got here.

426
00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:44.292
[baby fussing]

427
00:21:44.375 --> 00:21:45.333
I'm not sure how. Sammy.

428
00:21:45.667 --> 00:21:47.000
but I'm gonna give you
and your sister. Mary.

429
00:21:47.083 --> 00:21:48.417
the best life
that I can manage.

430
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.958
-Mama?

431
00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:56.208
Baby brother?

432
00:21:56.333 --> 00:21:59.208
-Mm-hmm. Sure is. Mary.
This is Sammy.

433
00:21:59.292 --> 00:22:03.458
-Hi Sammy. I love him.

434
00:22:03.458 --> 00:22:05.500
-And he loves you.

435
00:22:05.542 --> 00:22:07.542
-You'll never get away
from Willard now.

436
00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:10.333
Not after having his boy.

437
00:22:10.417 --> 00:22:12.250
-Pastor McCall says
there's always a way.

438
00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.000
-Church don't offer the kind
of sanctuary you think it does.

439
00:22:16.417 --> 00:22:19.167
-Sunday school is fun.

440
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.500
-I know it is. Mary.

441
00:22:20.833 --> 00:22:22.958
We're gonna be spending lots
more time there at church too.

442
00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:24.583
you wait and see. Okay?

443
00:22:26.583 --> 00:22:27.333
Yeah.

444
00:22:28.292 --> 00:22:30.792
-From me for you.

445
00:22:30.875 --> 00:22:32.458
-Aww.

446
00:22:32.458 --> 00:22:36.167
-Paid with my.
um... allowance.

447
00:22:36.167 --> 00:22:37.750
-Ain't you the sweetest.

448
00:22:38.833 --> 00:22:39.833
-[Willard] Who. me?

449
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.083
-Did you get those
outta the trash?

450
00:22:46.042 --> 00:22:47.167
Come on. Mary.

451
00:22:47.542 --> 00:22:48.708
Let's leave your mama to
the family she chose over you.

452
00:22:48.792 --> 00:22:49.583
-Mama!

453
00:22:49.583 --> 00:22:50.500
-Well. am I wrong?

454
00:22:50.708 --> 00:22:51.458
-You can't say something
like that...

455
00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:52.375
-She knows what's going on.
I raised her...

456
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:53.500
-But if you keep talking
negative like that

457
00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:55.917
it's gonna start
rubbing off on her.

458
00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:57.667
-I'm sorry but she's
a smart girl.

459
00:22:57.667 --> 00:22:58.708
she knows what's going on.

460
00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:00.208
-I didn't think you'd say
something like that...

461
00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:01.292
-Excuse me.

462
00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:03.250
-...what. am I lying?

463
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.125
-Of course you're not.

464
00:23:04.208 --> 00:23:05.125
-Willard!

465
00:23:06.792 --> 00:23:08.458
-Mary and I was just playing.

466
00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:11.375
Ain't that right?

467
00:23:20.708 --> 00:23:22.042
My handsome little man.

468
00:23:25.333 --> 00:23:26.667
You done good.

469
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.667
[bell tolling]

470
00:23:46.167 --> 00:23:48.917
-Don't you worry none. Sammy.

471
00:23:48.917 --> 00:23:51.875
I'm sure your daddy
just got held up at work...

472
00:23:51.875 --> 00:23:53.708
or something important
like that.

473
00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:56.417
Yeah. It's okay.

474
00:24:06.042 --> 00:24:07.708
I told you to be here by 3:30.
Willard.

475
00:24:07.708 --> 00:24:08.708
So what's got you...

476
00:24:11.375 --> 00:24:12.708
Susan.

477
00:24:14.458 --> 00:24:16.708
You're the last person
I'd expect to pick me up.

478
00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:19.542
-Willard didn't leave me
much of a choice.

479
00:24:25.208 --> 00:24:26.625
-I told you I could drive.

480
00:24:28.875 --> 00:24:30.083
-I knew you was carrying on
behind my back

481
00:24:30.375 --> 00:24:34.250
but you kept at it even while
I was having Willard's baby?

482
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.833
-I tried warning you he was
no good all those years ago.

483
00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:38.375
-Yeah. but then you went
and had a kid with him

484
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.917
when he and I
was broken up.

485
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.125
-And here you are!
Following my lead.

486
00:24:46.125 --> 00:24:47.625
Don't you need a ride?

487
00:24:56.792 --> 00:24:57.833
-Did you put the baby down?

488
00:24:58.042 --> 00:25:02.208
-Yeah. he's fine.
Let's just focus on Willard.

489
00:25:02.208 --> 00:25:03.583
[Willard thuds]

490
00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:07.000
-What's the baby's name?

491
00:25:07.083 --> 00:25:08.292
-Sammy.

492
00:25:08.292 --> 00:25:10.917
-Sammy? You mean Susan.

493
00:25:12.875 --> 00:25:14.208
[groans]

494
00:25:14.208 --> 00:25:16.000
[laughs]

495
00:25:16.042 --> 00:25:17.417
My two best girls.

496
00:25:17.542 --> 00:25:18.958
-Willard. don't.

497
00:25:20.083 --> 00:25:23.125
-You think you can boss me
around? Huh?

498
00:25:23.208 --> 00:25:25.167
You tell me what to do?

499
00:25:25.167 --> 00:25:27.083
Disrespect me in front
of the woman I love.

500
00:25:27.167 --> 00:25:28.000
-Willard.
-What?

501
00:25:29.167 --> 00:25:30.708
It's true. isn't it?

502
00:25:32.167 --> 00:25:33.500
-I don't gotta take this.

503
00:25:33.583 --> 00:25:36.083
-Well. you wanna leave
then leave.

504
00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:38.125
You're gonna do it
the way you came...

505
00:25:38.125 --> 00:25:38.917
with nothing.

506
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.708
-No.

507
00:25:39.792 --> 00:25:40.708
-Let her take her baby.

508
00:25:40.792 --> 00:25:42.000
-It ain't hers to take.

509
00:25:42.125 --> 00:25:45.167
-No! No! No!

510
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.500
[baby fussing]

511
00:25:47.583 --> 00:25:49.000
If you take my baby
I swear I'll...

512
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.167
-What?

513
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:51.500
What are you gonna do. huh?

514
00:25:51.583 --> 00:25:53.833
Your own mama loves you
less than I do.

515
00:25:53.917 --> 00:25:56.542
You leave and your kids'll
become wards of the state.

516
00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:57.917
So I'd think long and hard

517
00:25:58.208 --> 00:26:01.042
before you start making threats
that don't add up to nothing.

518
00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:07.708
-So ultimately you never left?
Even as your kids grew older.

519
00:26:07.792 --> 00:26:10.083
Even as the abuse extended
to them.

520
00:26:10.167 --> 00:26:12.708
-Well. honestly I didn't know
how to leave him.

521
00:26:12.708 --> 00:26:14.000
I was flat broke.

522
00:26:14.083 --> 00:26:17.500
I had to choose between
being free from Willard

523
00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:19.708
and feeding my babies.

524
00:26:19.708 --> 00:26:22.417
-Wasn't there anyone
you could ask for help?

525
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.875
Like your mother?

526
00:26:28.667 --> 00:26:30.083
-My pastor.

527
00:26:32.875 --> 00:26:33.958
And you sure you ain't
gonna say

528
00:26:34.042 --> 00:26:36.000
nothing to anyone.
Pastor McCall?

529
00:26:36.042 --> 00:26:38.750
-What you share here stays
between us and the Lord.

530
00:26:44.042 --> 00:26:45.833
-Willard says he's gonna take
Sammy away

531
00:26:45.917 --> 00:26:47.667
if I try and get divorced.

532
00:26:48.208 --> 00:26:50.833
Sammy's only six years old.
it wouldn't be safe.

533
00:26:51.958 --> 00:26:54.917
-You familiar with Ephesians?
Chapter four. verse three?

534
00:26:56.458 --> 00:26:58.667
"Make every effort to keep
the unity of the spirit

535
00:26:58.708 --> 00:27:00.167
"through the bond of peace."

536
00:27:00.208 --> 00:27:01.292
-Peace?

537
00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:03.708
[chuckles]

538
00:27:03.708 --> 00:27:08.708
No disrespect but I ain't know
peace in years.

539
00:27:08.792 --> 00:27:10.958
I mean. it's bad enough
Mama's always riding me

540
00:27:11.042 --> 00:27:13.083
even though we pay the bills

541
00:27:13.167 --> 00:27:15.708
´cause she gambled
all her savings away.

542
00:27:15.792 --> 00:27:17.667
Then there's Willard's
cheating and...

543
00:27:19.958 --> 00:27:21.833
This way of living ain't right.

544
00:27:22.458 --> 00:27:24.875
Especially not for Mary
or Sammy.

545
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.000
I. uh... it's probably a mistake

546
00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:31.958
bringing all this up with you.
I'm...

547
00:27:31.958 --> 00:27:33.375
-No. no.
Maybe if I spoke to Willard.

548
00:27:33.458 --> 00:27:35.625
-Oh. no.
Promise you won't.

549
00:27:35.625 --> 00:27:39.000
I know Willard can come off
all sweet and polite but...

550
00:27:39.083 --> 00:27:42.000
he's got a real dark side and
I don't want you getting hurt.

551
00:27:42.083 --> 00:27:43.250
Alright? I got my hands full

552
00:27:43.333 --> 00:27:44.792
trying to keep him
from beating Mary.

553
00:27:44.875 --> 00:27:46.333
-Is that why you've been
bringing Mary

554
00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:47.583
by the church so often?

555
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.292
-Yeah. well she feels safe here.
It makes her less combative.

556
00:27:53.375 --> 00:27:56.875
Sometimes she can be scary
protective of me around Willard.

557
00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:58.792
-I've noticed she has
a lack of patience

558
00:27:58.875 --> 00:28:00.333
and even compassion at times.

559
00:28:00.458 --> 00:28:02.292
-She's always saying
that one day she's gonna try

560
00:28:02.292 --> 00:28:04.500
and stop Willard.

561
00:28:04.542 --> 00:28:07.708
-You don't think she'd actually
harm anyone. do you?

562
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.250
-Honestly?

563
00:28:14.542 --> 00:28:16.000
I don't know.

00:28:25.542 --> 00:28:27.125
-Can I do the next box?

566
00:28:27.208 --> 00:28:28.792
-Yeah. you can do them later.
It's not your turn.

567
00:28:28.875 --> 00:28:31.250
-You two aren't getting
in the way. are you?

568
00:28:31.333 --> 00:28:32.042
-We're helping. Mama.

569
00:28:32.375 --> 00:28:35.125
-I know you are.
And what about you Sammy?

570
00:28:35.208 --> 00:28:36.000
-[laughs]

571
00:28:36.333 --> 00:28:38.000
-Well he wanted to do
all the heavy lifting

572
00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:40.042
but I told him to leave it
to me.

573
00:28:40.125 --> 00:28:41.750
-Well you and your sister
should go get your coats on

574
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.208
before your daddy gets here.
Okay?

575
00:28:43.208 --> 00:28:44.500
You know he don't like
to be kept waiting.

576
00:28:44.583 --> 00:28:46.292
-Okay. Come on.

577
00:28:47.958 --> 00:28:49.792
-You always keep this place
looking so good.

578
00:28:49.792 --> 00:28:51.833
-Not as good as you. Veronica.

-[chuckles]
Oh. Perkins.

580
00:28:53.875 --> 00:28:56.458
Don't you know lying's a sin?
Especially in church.

-A new car.

584
00:29:08.292 --> 00:29:10.250
-Yeah. it's time I drove
something a little more rugged

585
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.708
to match my style.

586
00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:13.375
-That there's a fine vehicle.
Willard.

587
00:29:15.375 --> 00:29:17.667
-I didn't know we could afford
something like this.

588
00:29:17.667 --> 00:29:20.333
-I got my first check from
that cross-country trucking gig.

589
00:29:20.417 --> 00:29:21.167
-Isn't that cool?

590

-Even though I can barely manage
the grocery bills?

591
00:29:23.792 --> 00:29:25.208
-How is you being too stupid

592
00:29:25.208 --> 00:29:27.792
to keep up with a bank account
my problem?

593
00:29:27.875 --> 00:29:29.667
Hey Sammy...

594
00:29:29.667 --> 00:29:30.833

you wanna check it out?

Hey. hey. hey!
Careful. you ungrateful brat.

This car is worth way more
than you'll ever be.

-Oh. Willard.
-What?!

600
00:29:45.625 --> 00:29:46.958
Nothing to see here. Bo.

601
00:29:51.542 --> 00:29:52.542
Wait in the car.

-Where do you think?

604
00:29:55.417 --> 00:29:58.375
I'm gonna do what I always do.

the weekend Willard said
that I was gonna die.

the man who wrecked my Jeep?

It wasn't a man. Veronica.

watching your brother?

hard of hearing on her left side

702
00:35:29.917 --> 00:35:33.875
because of an injury sustained
at the hands of Willard Simms.

706
00:35:46.875 --> 00:35:51.083
Is your version of what happened
the same as your daughter's?

707
00:35:51.167 --> 00:35:53.458
-My daughter told her... truth.

708
00:35:56.458 --> 00:35:58.167
Now I'll tell mine.

709
00:36:02.542 --> 00:36:05.833
-Okay. Mama. you can feed Mary
for a little bit.

710
00:36:05.833 --> 00:36:06.792
I'm late meeting Willard.

711
00:36:07.167 --> 00:36:09.542
-Look. you know I'll do anything
for you and Mary. sweetheart.

712
00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:13.417
But is hanging out with Willard
Simms really a good idea?

-Mama. You just hate it
don't you?

That I'm young and pretty and I
got my whole life ahead of me.

before Mary was due...

I need in my life right now.

wouldn't hear us.

-Do I have to remind you.
you're still underage?

all you want. old woman.

but it ain't never gonna take.

753

I'll never stop trying?

repeatedly about the dangers

But so was...
so is my daughter.

Putting the two of them together

769

That walk to church
ain't so bad. right?

771

is fun.

What is it. Grandma?

-Leave me be. Mary.

785
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.417
-How about you go down
to the kitchen

786
00:39:05.542 --> 00:39:06.833
and get a cookie out
of the cookie jar?

787
00:39:06.833 --> 00:39:08.042
-But...
-We'll be along in a minute.

788
00:39:09.625 --> 00:39:11.250
Can I help you find something?

789

-Have you got anything stronger
than this?

790
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.250
Something that seems natural
but taking in a giant dose

791
00:39:15.333 --> 00:39:17.292
would be powerful enough
to kill someone?

792
00:39:17.375 --> 00:39:19.833
-Kill someone?
Or kill Willard?

793
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.125
You know you can leave him

794
00:39:22.417 --> 00:39:24.125
and move back in here
with me and Mary.

00:39:24.125 --> 00:39:26.792

-The more kids I have the more
money I get from the state.

798
00:39:32.208 --> 00:39:34.958
But Willard's never gonna
let me leave with his baby.

799
00:39:34.958 --> 00:39:36.708
Not that I'm sure this kid
I'm carrying's even his.

800
00:39:36.833 --> 00:39:39.292
So I gotta consider
other options.

-Like poison?

like you. Veronica.

-You don't know me.
You never did.

806
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.417
I'm my own person and I'm gonna
do whatever it takes

807
00:39:49.417 --> 00:39:51.042
to live the kinda life
that I deserve.

-I'm high.

810
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.167
Not that I'd expect you to know
the difference.

811
00:39:57.042 --> 00:39:58.542
You got any poison or not?

could move back in with you.

-Yeah. but I didn't think
it'd be with Willard.

816
00:40:21.542 --> 00:40:24.042
Do you really think he's
a good influence on Mary?

can discuss other options.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.292
Don't look so scared.
I'm not the boogeyman.

877
00:43:20.042 --> 00:43:22.167
No one wants to be
the bad guy. you know?

878
00:43:24.042 --> 00:43:25.750
I'm not proud of my struggle.

879
00:43:29.833 --> 00:43:32.375
You understand that. right?
Mom?

880
00:43:36.125 --> 00:43:38.708
Whether you do or not.
listen to me clear old woman.

881
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.833
Try and call for help again
and you will live to regret it.

882
00:43:44.875 --> 00:43:47.458
-You don't scare me
Willard Simms.

883
00:43:47.542 --> 00:43:50.917
-[chuckles]
No. maybe not.

884
00:43:51.042 --> 00:43:54.125
What about your granddaughter.
Mary?

885
00:43:54.208 --> 00:43:55.125
Hmm?

886
00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:58.208
I know how to hurt you.

887
00:44:08.042 --> 00:44:10.458
-Things were worse than I
imagined they ever could be.

888
00:44:12.042 --> 00:44:14.250
And I've been through
a lot in life.

889
00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:17.958
-You say you made it
your mission to protect Mary.

890
00:44:17.958 --> 00:44:20.750
-Well my daughter wouldn't.

891
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.167
So I had to. or...
at least I tried.

892
00:44:26.375 --> 00:44:29.125
But by the time Mary was a young
lady she was already helping me

893
00:44:29.125 --> 00:44:31.083
more than I could ever help her.

894
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:37.167
Mary cooked. cleaned
and took care of all of us.

895
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:38.542
Especially Sammy.

896
00:44:38.625 --> 00:44:41.375
Her love for her baby brother
was something to treasure.

897
00:44:41.458 --> 00:44:43.333
-Alright. here's breakfast.

898
00:44:43.333 --> 00:44:45.792
-And lunch. Am I right?

899
00:44:47.875 --> 00:44:50.875
-We're not due for more food
stamps until week's end.

900
00:44:50.875 --> 00:44:51.708
Willard didn't leave any cash

901
00:44:52.042 --> 00:44:53.833
when he went on his
last trucking run.

902
00:44:53.958 --> 00:44:55.458
-Don't worry. Grandma.

903
00:44:55.458 --> 00:44:58.417
-Willard's my daddy. not yours.

904
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.333
-Still makes you my brother
and I love you Sammy.

905
00:45:01.417 --> 00:45:02.208
-Gross!

906
00:45:03.792 --> 00:45:05.583
-You can't go without eating.
Mary.

907
00:45:05.708 --> 00:45:08.458
-Done it plenty of times before.

908
00:45:08.542 --> 00:45:09.583
-[sighs]

909
00:45:09.667 --> 00:45:10.875
Enough's enough.

910
00:45:20.542 --> 00:45:22.208
Time you started treating
your kids as more than a way

911
00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:24.375
to get an allowance
from the state. Veronica.

912
00:45:24.375 --> 00:45:25.500
-Leave me be. I was up late.

913
00:45:25.583 --> 00:45:27.167
-You don't think I know that?

914
00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:28.500
You don't think I hear
strange men

915
00:45:28.875 --> 00:45:31.458
coming in and out of this house
all hours of the night?

916
00:45:31.542 --> 00:45:33.083
-You're imagining things.

917
00:45:36.833 --> 00:45:38.208
-What if I was Willard?

918
00:45:40.417 --> 00:45:43.917
-Willard's not due back
from the road ´till week's end.

919
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.292
I need my beauty rest.

920
00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:46.500
-No. what we need is food.

921
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:48.500
Now you take Willard's Jeep.
go down to the Piggly Wiggly

922
00:45:48.542 --> 00:45:49.792
and see if we have
any credit left.

923
00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:51.042
-I can't.

924
00:45:51.833 --> 00:45:53.833
-Your kids are starvin'.

925
00:45:53.958 --> 00:45:56.625
-The Jeep's not here.
A friend borrowed it.

926
00:45:56.708 --> 00:45:59.500
-You let somebody borrow
Willard's Jeep?

927
00:45:59.542 --> 00:46:00.458
-He needed cigarettes.

928
00:46:00.708 --> 00:46:02.917
he promised he'd bring it
right back.

929
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.500
-And how long ago was that?

930
00:46:04.583 --> 00:46:05.458
-I don't know.

931
00:46:06.333 --> 00:46:07.375
It's been hours.

932
00:46:09.458 --> 00:46:11.250
[phone ringing]

933
00:46:13.375 --> 00:46:14.208
Yeah.

934
00:46:15.333 --> 00:46:17.917
[dramatic music]

935
00:46:25.792 --> 00:46:27.292
-That your friend with the Jeep?

936
00:46:32.417 --> 00:46:33.917
-There was an accident.

937
00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:38.708
The Jeep crashed and it got
dented up real bad.

938
00:46:38.708 --> 00:46:40.292
Willard's gonna kill me
when he gets home

939
00:46:40.292 --> 00:46:43.000
and finds out his
new Jeep's wrecked.

940
00:46:43.042 --> 00:46:45.208
Especially if he knows another
guy was driving it.

941
00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:53.083
-You think I wouldn't find out
what really happened?

942
00:46:53.167 --> 00:46:54.667
-[Ella] Oh for the love
of God. Willard.

943
00:46:54.708 --> 00:46:55.750
Not in front of your kids.

944
00:46:55.833 --> 00:46:56.958
-What. my kids?

945
00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.625
Now I can't trust this slut
to take care of my Jeep.

946
00:46:59.708 --> 00:47:00.750
-No. you got things twisted.

947
00:47:01.125 --> 00:47:04.333
-Now enough with the lies!
This is the weekend you die.

948
00:47:04.417 --> 00:47:05.583
-Veronica. no.

949
00:47:05.708 --> 00:47:07.667
-What other choice have we got?

950
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:09.667
How many times you call
the cops?

951
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.542
And?

952
00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:13.000
Nothin'.

953
00:47:13.083 --> 00:47:15.917
Willard don't make
any sense anymore.

954
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.542
All he wants to do
is hurt us.

955
00:47:20.208 --> 00:47:23.375
He said I'm gonna die
this weekend.

956
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.250
Which is why I need you
to kill him for me. Mary.

957
00:47:25.333 --> 00:47:26.833
while he's passed out drunk
in front of the TV.

958
00:47:26.958 --> 00:47:28.250
-Veronica. please!

959
00:47:29.833 --> 00:47:31.875
-I can't. Mama.

960
00:47:31.958 --> 00:47:33.292
I don't even know how
to use a gun.

961
00:47:33.292 --> 00:47:35.750
-Sure you do.
we've been over it lots.

962
00:47:35.875 --> 00:47:37.000
-Do you hear yourself?

963
00:47:37.042 --> 00:47:39.167
What you're asking
your little girl to do?

964
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:41.750
-Mary's practically
all grown up.

965
00:47:41.833 --> 00:47:44.000
You'd do anything for me.
wouldn't you?

966
00:47:44.083 --> 00:47:45.667
You gotta shoot Willard
in the head.

967
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:46.875
Kill him before he kills me.

968
00:47:46.875 --> 00:47:47.875
-Mary. don't listen to her.

969
00:47:47.958 --> 00:47:49.042
-One of us has to use
this rifle

970
00:47:49.125 --> 00:47:50.375
before Willard wakes up.

971
00:47:52.417 --> 00:47:54.667
[intense dramatic music]

972
00:48:09.417 --> 00:48:11.375
[footsteps]

973
00:48:23.542 --> 00:48:26.417
[dramatic music intensifies]

974
00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.583
[gunshot echoes]

975
00:48:50.042 --> 00:48:52.083
-I'll leave it to God to decide
who's guilty.

976
00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:56.208
But I do know
who's not innocent.

977
00:49:02.458 --> 00:49:05.208
-You've confirmed
battered woman syndrome.

978
00:49:05.292 --> 00:49:08.042
And we heard from the gentleman
who testified the accused

979
00:49:08.042 --> 00:49:11.000
asked him to kill the victim
three years ago.

980
00:49:11.042 --> 00:49:15.542
But you haven't yet revealed
what actually took place

981
00:49:15.625 --> 00:49:17.958
in the room the moment
the deceased was shot.

982
00:49:18.042 --> 00:49:20.500
Not to mention who actually
pulled the trigger.

983
00:49:22.375 --> 00:49:25.625
What we've heard thus far
is hearsay at best.

984
00:49:25.708 --> 00:49:28.708
I see no choice but to have the
daughter of the accused testify.

985
00:49:28.792 --> 00:49:31.667
-No. No. I won't do it.

986
00:49:31.792 --> 00:49:34.708
I love my mama. I don't want
anything bad to happen to her.

987
00:49:34.708 --> 00:49:37.542
-You wouldn't be testifying
against anyone. Mary.

988
00:49:37.625 --> 00:49:39.458
You'd be telling your side
of things.

989
00:49:39.542 --> 00:49:42.333
helping everyone understand
what really happened.

990
00:49:42.375 --> 00:49:46.000
-The decision's yours. Mary.
No one else's.

991
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.042
-If you won't testify

992
00:49:47.375 --> 00:49:50.000
we'll have no other choice
but to prosecute you.

993
00:49:50.042 --> 00:49:51.333
-Now come on.

994
00:49:51.667 --> 00:49:53.625
-She's under arrest for the same
murder charge as her mother.

995
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.625
-I'm sorry. Mary.
They got us in the crosshairs.

996
00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:04.208
-So what's it gonna be?

997
00:50:04.208 --> 00:50:05.833
Tell everything you know
in court

998
00:50:05.875 --> 00:50:08.250
or go on trial
for murder yourself?

999
00:50:13.292 --> 00:50:18.458

-You okay?

1005
00:50:56.042 --> 00:50:57.042
Shouldn't your foster brothers
and sisters

1006
00:50:57.042 --> 00:50:58.875
bring in their own dishes?

1007
00:50:59.333 --> 00:51:00.833
-I help my Grandma plenty
at home.

1008
00:51:02.042 --> 00:51:03.125
-Which is lovely.

1009
00:51:03.833 --> 00:51:06.208
But you know it's okay to have
fun every now and then. right?

Stop.

-I can't imagine
all the emotions

1019
00:51:37.583 --> 00:51:39.208
you must be feeling
right now.

1020
00:51:39.292 --> 00:51:41.375
-I'm worried for my mama.

1021
00:51:41.458 --> 00:51:43.375
-I'm sure she's worried
about you too.

1022
00:51:44.458 --> 00:51:46.792
Which is why she'd want you
to do what's right.

1023
00:51:52.875 --> 00:51:54.750
-You mean... testify?

1024
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.333
I just want all this to go away.

1025
00:51:59.333 --> 00:52:03.750
So I could go back to being
with Mama. Sammy and Grandma.

1026
00:52:03.833 --> 00:52:08.000
I don't wanna go to jail but I
don't want it for Mama either.

1027
00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:12.375
-Nobody knows how all of this
will turn out.

1028
00:52:12.458 --> 00:52:14.375
But if they don't have
the full story...

1029
00:52:19.083 --> 00:52:21.542
Maybe if you spoke to your mom.

1030
00:52:21.542 --> 00:52:23.125
-If they let me.

1031
00:52:23.208 --> 00:52:26.125
will you drive me to jail
to see her?

1032
00:52:26.208 --> 00:52:28.000
-Mary. your mom's been out
on parole

1033
00:52:28.083 --> 00:52:30.375
since the day of the arrest.

1034
00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:33.375
Since the day you came
into foster care.

1035
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.917
-That can't be true.

1036
00:52:35.917 --> 00:52:39.542
-I assumed you knew.

1037
00:52:39.542 --> 00:52:42.792
-Why wouldn't she come
see me?

1038
00:52:42.792 --> 00:52:46.833
-Parole can be complicated.
Maybe she got busy and she...

1039
00:52:46.833 --> 00:52:47.792
-I'd like to be alone now.

1040
00:52:52.333 --> 00:52:54.208

-The people call Mary Bailey
to the stand.

1045
00:53:21.708 --> 00:53:23.875
-We don't want
your mother's story

1046
00:53:23.875 --> 00:53:26.000
or your grandmother's story.

1047
00:53:26.083 --> 00:53:28.250
We want your story. Mary.

1048

-I always loved my mama and I
always wanted to be with her.

1049
00:53:39.708 --> 00:53:41.583
It seemed like I was always
waiting for her though.

1050
00:53:42.958 --> 00:53:44.250
[Veronica giggling]

1051
00:53:44.542 --> 00:53:46.500
I couldn't understand why Mama
lived life the way she did.

1052
00:53:48.708 --> 00:53:51.292
But... I figured she had
her reasons.

1053
00:53:51.375 --> 00:53:52.542
-We haven't got all night.

1054
00:53:55.333 --> 00:53:57.000
[both laughing]

1055
00:53:57.083 --> 00:53:58.583
-Shh!
-Shh.

1056
00:53:58.875 --> 00:54:01.125
-Keep it down. you're gonna
wake my mama up.

1057
00:54:01.208 --> 00:54:02.208
-Let's wake her up.

1058
00:54:02.208 --> 00:54:03.500
[both laughing]

1059
00:54:03.583 --> 00:54:05.250
What we need is another drink.

1060
00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:06.667
-Mama?

1061
00:54:07.542 --> 00:54:10.208
-Mary. what are you doing up?
You're supposed to be in bed.

1062
00:54:10.292 --> 00:54:12.250
-I wanna be with you. Mama.

1063
00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:13.167
-Need me to handle this?

1064
00:54:13.375 --> 00:54:15.458
-No. no. it's good.
We're good.

1065
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Listen...

1066
00:54:17.458 --> 00:54:20.667
Go on now.
Get back to bed. okay?

1067
00:54:20.708 --> 00:54:24.000
Next time I'm over I'm gonna
paint your fingernails. Okay?

1068
00:54:24.125 --> 00:54:25.042
-Can they be red?

1069
00:54:25.042 --> 00:54:26.375
-Uh huh. that's my favorite.

1070
00:54:31.875 --> 00:54:33.833
-All these stories in town.
you're saying it's all a lie?

1071
00:54:33.917 --> 00:54:34.917
-What do you mean?

1072
00:54:34.917 --> 00:54:36.375
[arguing overlapping]

1073
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.000
-Usually it was me watching
over Mama

1074
00:54:39.083 --> 00:54:40.417
instead of the other way around.

1075
00:54:41.875 --> 00:54:42.667
-Oh...

1076
00:54:45.458 --> 00:54:46.833
-Why do people fight?

1077
00:54:49.417 --> 00:54:51.333
-I wish I knew. baby girl.

1078
00:54:52.958 --> 00:54:55.500
Your step-daddy keeps promising
that he's gonna do better

1079
00:54:55.583 --> 00:54:57.792
but then that promise
never sticks.

1080
00:54:58.917 --> 00:55:03.500
Willard's always talking
about me being the only one

1081
00:55:03.542 --> 00:55:06.917
that can save him from himself.
But...

1082
00:55:10.167 --> 00:55:14.000
It just don't seem to be anyone
around to save you and me. Mary.

1083
00:55:15.375 --> 00:55:17.208
-I thought a lot about
running away.

1084
00:55:17.333 --> 00:55:18.792
Ever since I could remember.

1085
00:55:18.875 --> 00:55:21.750
But I figured if I left.
who would take care of Mama?

1086
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.083
-What made you feel you needed
to protect your mother

1087
00:55:31.083 --> 00:55:33.500
from Willard Simms. Mary?

1088
00:55:33.583 --> 00:55:34.750
-Being scared of my step-daddy

1089
00:55:34.833 --> 00:55:38.250
was something me and her
had in common.

1090
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:39.708
-Because he'd beat you both?

1091
00:55:41.375 --> 00:55:44.042
-Yes ma'am.
Beat everyone in the family.

1092
00:55:45.333 --> 00:55:46.458
A lot.

1093
00:55:47.125 --> 00:55:49.375
But those weren't the only times
we were scared.

1094
00:55:51.292 --> 00:55:53.167
-Somebody better find
my glasses.

1095
00:55:53.292 --> 00:55:56.458
-There was no guessin' what
my step-daddy might say or do.

1096
00:55:56.542 --> 00:55:59.167
Could be sweet as a baby bird
one minute

1097
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:00.833
and mean as a rattlesnake
the next.

1098
00:56:00.917 --> 00:56:02.250
-Where are you Mary?

1099
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:03.208
-Sorta like a firecracker

1100
00:56:03.542 --> 00:56:05.875
that would go off all by itself
without warning.

1101
00:56:05.958 --> 00:56:06.833
-Gotcha.

1102
00:56:07.375 --> 00:56:09.667
-Sounds like a frightening way
to live life.

1103
00:56:11.333 --> 00:56:12.625
-I hid.

1104
00:56:13.833 --> 00:56:14.792
A lot.

1105
00:56:18.583 --> 00:56:20.167
-I promised after
last time that...

1106
00:56:21.667 --> 00:56:23.458
I wouldn't hurt you.

1107
00:56:24.958 --> 00:56:26.042
Not again.

1108
00:56:41.542 --> 00:56:43.667
-[crying]

1109
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:45.833
[dramatic music intensifies]

1110
00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:01.042
-Think I don't know
where you get to

1111
00:57:01.042 --> 00:57:02.792
when you should be in school.
Mary Bailey?

1112
00:57:04.625 --> 00:57:09.625
-I was hiding from Willard.
then decided I couldn't take

1113
00:57:09.625 --> 00:57:10.667
the teasing I was getting
in class

1114
00:57:11.042 --> 00:57:15.208
for wearing the same clothes
and never having lunch money.

1115
00:57:15.208 --> 00:57:19.667
-Oh. Mary.
My heart breaks for you.

1116
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:21.042
But you know I don't like
the idea

1117
00:57:21.125 --> 00:57:22.875
of you missing your lessons.

1118
00:57:22.958 --> 00:57:25.792
-You're not gonna tell Mama.
are you?

1119
00:57:25.875 --> 00:57:27.125
Or Willard?

1120
00:57:29.625 --> 00:57:30.875
-Get your shoes on.

1121
00:57:37.542 --> 00:57:40.875
-Are you taking me to
the principal's office?

1122
00:57:40.875 --> 00:57:42.083
-You'll see.

1123
00:57:44.125 --> 00:57:46.458
Some of you know my
granddaughter Mary.

1124
00:57:46.542 --> 00:57:51.000
who sometimes decides
her place isn't in school.

1125
00:57:51.083 --> 00:57:52.792
Thought we might be able
to help her feel

1126
00:57:52.875 --> 00:57:53.708
more accepting of herself

1127
00:57:54.083 --> 00:57:55.333
so that all the teasing
she gets in class

1128
00:57:55.375 --> 00:57:56.833
don't bother her so much.

1129
00:57:57.458 --> 00:57:58.750
-Welcome. Mary.

1130
00:58:02.375 --> 00:58:05.208
We were just telling some jokes.

1131
00:58:05.333 --> 00:58:06.583
-In church?

1132
00:58:06.667 --> 00:58:07.500
-I like to keep things light

1133
00:58:07.833 --> 00:58:09.250
between my Sunday
and Wednesday sermons.

1134
00:58:09.333 --> 00:58:10.167
[chuckles]

1135
00:58:11.125 --> 00:58:12.875
Uh... okay. I got one.

1136
00:58:12.958 --> 00:58:15.792
What do pirates
call Noah's boat?

1137
00:58:16.875 --> 00:58:18.208
The Arrrrrk.

1138
00:58:18.208 --> 00:58:20.708
[group laughing]

1139
00:58:21.708 --> 00:58:23.167
It's okay to laugh. Mary.

1140
00:58:23.292 --> 00:58:24.542
-Try telling a funny joke.

1141
00:58:24.667 --> 00:58:27.167
[all laughing]

1142
00:58:27.667 --> 00:58:29.875
Guess I'll try harder next week.
won't I?

1143
00:58:29.958 --> 00:58:31.625
[laughs]

1144
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:34.542
-All of a sudden I wasn't
thinking about hiding so much.

1145
00:58:34.625 --> 00:58:36.750
I finally felt like I had
a place I fit in.

1146
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:38.958
a place I belonged.

1147
00:58:40.708 --> 00:58:42.208
If only I didn't have to go home
to Willard

1148
00:58:42.292 --> 00:58:43.375
in between being at church.

1149
00:58:43.833 --> 00:58:44.833
-[Willard] You telling me
what to do?

1150
00:58:44.958 --> 00:58:45.833
-[Veronica] Would you
let me explain?

1151
00:58:46.042 --> 00:58:47.292
-[Willard] No. you're done
explaining.

1152
00:58:47.375 --> 00:58:49.458
-[slap]
-[Veronica screams]

1153
00:58:49.542 --> 00:58:50.833
-[Veronica] Please listen to me.

1154
00:58:50.917 --> 00:58:51.875
-[Willard] No. I'm not listening
to anything

1155
00:58:51.875 --> 00:58:53.417
you say anymore Veronica.

1156
00:58:53.417 --> 00:58:57.500
I am sick and tired of this.
Come here!

1157
00:58:57.625 --> 00:58:59.583
Now you need to respect me.
Veronica.

1158
00:58:59.583 --> 00:59:00.542
-[Veronica] I'm sorry. okay?

1159
00:59:00.875 --> 00:59:03.042
-Now I'll show you what happens
when you don't...

1160
00:59:03.167 --> 00:59:04.208
[knock on door]

1161
00:59:04.292 --> 00:59:05.708
-Shh! Shh!

1162
00:59:06.292 --> 00:59:07.292
Willard. no!

1163
00:59:07.292 --> 00:59:09.042
-Stop it. stop it. Stop.

1164
00:59:09.875 --> 00:59:11.417
-Sammy?

1165
00:59:11.417 --> 00:59:13.000
-I'm scared.

1166
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:13.958
-Yeah. come in.

1167
00:59:17.167 --> 00:59:19.833
[suspenseful music]

1168
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.542
-What the hell is going on
in here?

1169
00:59:22.708 --> 00:59:23.542
-Nothing.

1170
00:59:23.708 --> 00:59:24.375
We was just...

1171
00:59:24.667 --> 00:59:25.917
-Wasn't talking to you. Mary.

1172
00:59:28.375 --> 00:59:30.000
I was talking to someone
who matters.

1173
00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:36.167
Did she tempt you in here?

1174
00:59:36.167 --> 00:59:36.833
-What?

1175
00:59:36.833 --> 00:59:38.000
-I had a nightmare.

1176
00:59:40.583 --> 00:59:42.000
-So who should I hit first?

1177
00:59:42.042 --> 00:59:42.958
-Me!

1178
00:59:44.375 --> 00:59:45.292
Hit me.

1179
00:59:46.958 --> 00:59:48.875
I told Sam to come here
´cause I was scared.

1180
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000
-[chuckles]

1181
00:59:56.708 --> 00:59:58.750
You got more guts than most
people in this town.

1182
01:00:02.458 --> 01:00:03.375
[scoffs]

1183
01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:10.292
[chuckles]

1184
01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:21.917
-[crying] I peed.

1185
01:00:24.292 --> 01:00:26.500
-You have nothing to worry
about. Sammy.

1186
01:00:26.625 --> 01:00:27.917
Accidents happen.

1187
01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:36.042
Here. You can wear these.

1188
01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:38.292
-Thanks Mary.

1189
01:00:38.375 --> 01:00:39.250
-You're welcome.

1190
01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:48.083
I prayed hard for things
to get better

1191
01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:50.667
and I spent lots of time
at church too.

1192
01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:56.708
-So which is it today. Mary?

1193
01:00:56.792 --> 01:00:59.250
You skipping school or you
here ´cause you wanna be?

1194
01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.792
-I'd be here every day
if I could.

1195

-[chuckles]

1196
01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:04.708
Given more thought about
getting baptized?

1197
01:01:04.708 --> 01:01:08.042
-I want to. But...

1198
01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:09.875
-I know for a fact your grandma
would love for you

1199
01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:11.708
to identify with Christ.

1200
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.708
-It's Mama and Willard. He...

1201
01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:20.750
-More spankings?

1202
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.250
We can't always know
where the path we're on

1203
01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:25.875
will lead us. Mary.

1204
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.625
Some call our challenges
a test from God.

1205
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:33.292
like he's getting us ready
for something.

1206
01:01:33.375 --> 01:01:34.458
-Like what?

1207
01:01:34.542 --> 01:01:36.125
-Won't know ´till it happens.

1208
01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:38.833
When it does.
you gotta be ready.

1209
01:01:38.917 --> 01:01:42.000
For yourself and for everyone
you love.

1210
01:01:42.042 --> 01:01:44.333
-I wanna be ready.
Pastor McCall.

1211

When God calls on me to do
what I need to do.

1212
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.417
I'm gonna be ready.

1213
01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:54.375
-Is it ready yet?

1214
01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:55.417
-Oh. it's ready.

1215
01:01:56.875 --> 01:01:58.667
Mmm. Smells good.

1216
01:01:58.667 --> 01:01:59.792
-It's perfect. Grandma.

I want for Christmas more

1219
01:02:04.875 --> 01:02:06.542
than to spend it with you
and Sammy.

1222
01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:11.458
-Well if this ain't a Norman
Rockwell painting.

1223
01:02:11.458 --> 01:02:12.625
-Merry Christmas.

1224
01:02:12.708 --> 01:02:14.917
-And same to you. Mary.

1225
01:02:15.042 --> 01:02:17.333
-It's real nice of you Willard
to pay for the turkey

1226
01:02:17.375 --> 01:02:19.500
and all the fixings
for Christmas dinner.

1227
01:02:19.583 --> 01:02:23.083
-I'm glad you think so.
Come on Sammy. get your coat on.

1228
01:02:23.208 --> 01:02:24.583
-Where we going?

1229
01:02:24.667 --> 01:02:26.792
-Uh... we ain't going nowhere.

1230
01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:28.375
We're going to my girlfriend...

1231
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.167
your. uh. mother's girlfriend
Susan's house.

1232
01:02:35.208 --> 01:02:35.708
-What?

1233
01:02:35.958 --> 01:02:37.500
-We got a kid there too. so...

1234
01:02:37.542 --> 01:02:40.208
-Don't spill any of this
on the way to the car.

1235
01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:41.125
-Here buddy.

1236
01:02:45.792 --> 01:02:47.292
-What are you doing?

1237
01:02:47.292 --> 01:02:49.208
-I promised Susan we'd bring
Christmas dinner.

1238
01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:52.333
Forget who paid for this bird?

1239
01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:53.917
-It's not fair.

1240
01:02:54.042 --> 01:02:55.042
-Yeah. well keep being naughty

1241
01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:57.333
and it won't be Santa
who punishes you for it.

1242
01:02:57.417 --> 01:02:59.083
I said coats on. let's go.

1243
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.792
-Sammy come on. let's go.
Come on. get your coat on.

1244
01:03:06.625 --> 01:03:07.792
Let's go.

1245
01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:15.875
[door shuts]

1246
01:03:17.417 --> 01:03:20.583
-Remember what we learned
from Pastor McCall. Grandma?

1247
01:03:20.583 --> 01:03:22.750
Christmas ain't about gifts.

1248
01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:25.958
Or even special dinners
with all the fixings.

1249
01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:27.542
It's about Jesus. right?

1250
01:03:30.042 --> 01:03:33.125
-You've got a beautiful soul.
Mary Bailey.

1251
01:03:33.208 --> 01:03:36.417
-What I got is the best
gift ever.

1252
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:37.458
My grandma.

1253
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.667
-I don't think there's a person
in this courtroom

1254
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:46.167
who isn't inspired
by your ability

1255
01:03:46.292 --> 01:03:48.917
to recall the happier times.
Mary.

1256
01:03:48.917 --> 01:03:51.167
But now we need to talk
about the bad times.

1257
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.667
Can you tell us
about the events

1258
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:57.375
occurring in February
of 1987. Mary?

1259
01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:02.250
[dramatic music intensifies]

1260
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.458
-A new car?

1261
01:04:09.333 --> 01:04:10.250
-A new car.

1262
01:04:10.625 --> 01:04:12.417
-Yeah. it's time I drove
something a little more rugged

1263
01:04:12.417 --> 01:04:13.542
to match my style.

1264
01:04:15.375 --> 01:04:17.000
Hey. what do you think
you're doing?

1265
01:04:17.125 --> 01:04:18.500
-But... there's mud all over.

1266
01:04:18.542 --> 01:04:20.250
-This here car's worth more
than you'll ever be.

1267
01:04:20.333 --> 01:04:21.917
-I'm sorry. I was just trying...

1268
01:04:22.042 --> 01:04:22.875
-And what'd I say
about sassing me?

1269
01:04:23.167 --> 01:04:25.167
-Willard. no! Don't.
Not in front of...

1270
01:04:27.042 --> 01:04:28.417
-What the hell
are you looking at?

1271
01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:36.167
-That's when I finally
figured out why no one.

1272
01:04:36.292 --> 01:04:37.375
not even other grown-ups.

1273
01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:39.375
stopped him from being
how he was.

1274
01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:44.000
Everyone was right terrified
of Willard Simms.

1275
01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:46.458
He was a bad man.

1276
01:04:49.208 --> 01:04:51.292
-Is that why you decided to do
what you did to him?

1277
01:04:55.333 --> 01:04:57.167
-Do you understand
the question. Mary?

1278
01:05:03.042 --> 01:05:05.000
-I never decided to do
what I did.

1279
01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:09.917
I was asked...
well. told what to do.

1280
01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:19.292
Look Mama.

1281
01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:21.458
-Leave me be. Mary.

1282
01:05:23.708 --> 01:05:26.208
What if you said that
you crashed the Jeep?

1283
01:05:26.292 --> 01:05:28.292
-Willard knows I don't drive.

1284
01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:30.750
Besides. you don't think he'd
hurt me for messing up his car?

1285
01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:33.375
-I can't really blame the guy
who crashed it for leaving town.

1286
01:05:35.958 --> 01:05:38.583
I wish he took me with him.

1287
01:05:38.708 --> 01:05:40.542
-And what about
Mary and Sammy?

1288
01:05:40.542 --> 01:05:42.208
-I'm not able to collect welfare
without ´em.

1289
01:05:42.292 --> 01:05:44.292
that's the very reason I can
never leave Willard.

1290
01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:47.042
I lose the checks
if I lose the kids.

1291
01:05:47.042 --> 01:05:48.958
Except you Mary. Willard
don't even want you.

1292
01:05:48.958 --> 01:05:50.250
-Veronica.
-What?

1293
01:05:52.667 --> 01:05:54.625
[car engine rumbling]

1294
01:05:58.542 --> 01:06:01.125
[dramatic music]

1295
01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:05.000
I bet he's drunk enough
to kill us all.

1296
01:06:07.792 --> 01:06:08.667
[car door slams]

1297
01:06:09.625 --> 01:06:10.667
-Damn glasses.

1298
01:06:12.542 --> 01:06:14.458
[breathing heavily]

1299
01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.458
[door slams]

1300
01:06:28.125 --> 01:06:30.083
-You think I wouldn't find out
what really happened?

1301
01:06:30.167 --> 01:06:31.875
-Now Willard. you got
things twisted.

1302
01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:33.667
-Now. enough with the lies.

1303
01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:36.583
Now. people all over town are
saying there's another man

1304
01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:39.833
who crashed my Jeep.
Exactly like I thought.

1305
01:06:39.917 --> 01:06:42.208
As if you were faithful
when I was on my trucking runs.

1306
01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:45.875
There's my number one son.

1307
01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:47.042
Come here. buddy.

1308
01:06:48.042 --> 01:06:49.292
Come here buddy.
it's okay.

1309
01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:51.875
-Sammy.

1310
01:06:51.958 --> 01:06:53.042
-Sammy. sweetheart.

1311
01:06:55.375 --> 01:06:57.167
Was your mama kissing
one of her friends?

1312
01:06:58.667 --> 01:07:01.292
Or maybe another man
when I was away on the road?

1313
01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:05.250
-No.

1314
01:07:05.542 --> 01:07:07.667
-Did you trained him like
a parrot?

1315
01:07:07.708 --> 01:07:08.750
-Just try and calm down.

1316
01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:11.333
-Is that what you want. huh?
For me to calm down.

1317
01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.208
Actually. that's a fine idea.

1318
01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:19.917
-Willard. wait. Wait.

1319
01:07:20.042 --> 01:07:21.167
I was gonna tell you.

1320
01:07:21.542 --> 01:07:23.333
I just didn't know how to talk
to you. how to contact you.

1321
01:07:23.458 --> 01:07:24.583
-[blow thuds]
-[screams]

1322
01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:26.792
-For the love of God. Willard.
Not in front of your kids.

1323
01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:28.792
-My kids? My kids?!

1324
01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:29.833
[glass shatters]

1325
01:07:30.625 --> 01:07:33.208
I can't trust this slut
to take care of my Jeep.

1326
01:07:33.292 --> 01:07:34.458
Why should I trust her
with anything else?

1327
01:07:34.458 --> 01:07:35.375
-No!

1328
01:07:35.625 --> 01:07:36.792
-How do I know Sammy's
really my blood. huh?

1329
01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:38.792
Maybe I should kill him and see
if his real daddy steps forward.

1330
01:07:38.917 --> 01:07:40.667
-Leave Sammy be!

1331
01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:41.792
-What's gotten into you?

1332
01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:43.500
-Tell me if he's really my son!

1333
01:07:43.583 --> 01:07:44.250
-[crying] Stop it.

1334
01:07:44.375 --> 01:07:45.333
-I swear to God. Veronica.

1335
01:07:45.667 --> 01:07:46.958
I will snap his neck right here
in front of you!

1336
01:07:47.042 --> 01:07:47.958
-No!

1337
01:07:47.958 --> 01:07:49.375
-[crying] Please stop.

1338
01:07:50.708 --> 01:07:52.083
Please let him go.

1339
01:07:54.958 --> 01:07:57.250
-It's a weak man who can't
control his own family.

1340
01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:01.875
Guess it's time to remind
everybody who's in charge.

1341
01:08:01.875 --> 01:08:02.750
-[crying] No.

1342
01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:07.125
-Who's first? Hmm?

1343
01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:13.167
[dramatic music]

1344
01:08:18.542 --> 01:08:19.375
-Daddy?

1345
01:08:27.417 --> 01:08:29.458
-This is the weekend you die.

1346
01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:43.125
-Go put your brother to bed.
okay?

1347
01:08:43.208 --> 01:08:44.667
-Yes Mama [sniffs].

1348
01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:52.875
-[crying]

1349
01:09:00.125 --> 01:09:01.167
Is he passed out?

1350
01:09:01.208 --> 01:09:02.958
-Yeah. We gotta get
outta here.

1351
01:09:03.042 --> 01:09:04.583
-And go where?

1352
01:09:04.583 --> 01:09:06.417
-What happens
when he wakes up?

1353
01:09:08.458 --> 01:09:10.167
-Who says we're gonna
let him?

1354
01:09:15.958 --> 01:09:19.875
-[Mary] Things were quiet
but in a bad way.

1355
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.083
Sammy's sleeping.

1356
01:09:22.208 --> 01:09:24.250
-Is your step-daddy
still passed out?

1357
01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:28.375
-Far as I could tell.

1358
01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:33.208
-So this is the weekend
that I'm gonna die.

1359
01:09:33.208 --> 01:09:36.125
-I wish prayer served us better.

1360
01:09:36.208 --> 01:09:39.042
-There's only one way out.

1361
01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:40.750
Willard's gotta die first.

1362
01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:42.875
-Mary. you're too innocent
to be hearing all this.

1363
01:09:46.042 --> 01:09:47.208
-Mary...

1364
01:09:49.333 --> 01:09:50.958
You remember how to use
this gun?

1365
01:09:51.042 --> 01:09:51.875
-No.

1366
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.167
-Veronica!

1367
01:09:53.542 --> 01:09:55.417
-I'd fire the rifle if I could.
I'm too broken to hold it.

1368
01:09:57.042 --> 01:09:58.958
You're not Mary.
you're strong.

1369
01:10:01.167 --> 01:10:04.042
I need you to save me.

1370
01:10:04.125 --> 01:10:05.833
-Killing's a sin.

1371
01:10:05.875 --> 01:10:08.708
-But not if it's to keep someone
else alive. someone you love.

1372
01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:12.458
-Veronica.

1373
01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:13.625
-What jury's gonna convict
a little girl

1374
01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:16.542
of trying to protect her mama?
Mary'd never go to jail.

1375
01:10:16.542 --> 01:10:19.000
It's one bullet to the head.
that's all it'd take.

1376
01:10:19.042 --> 01:10:20.542
-No.

1377
01:10:20.542 --> 01:10:22.500
-To the chest then.
just shoot him in the chest.

1378
01:10:22.542 --> 01:10:23.792
Just make sure he's dead.

1379
01:10:25.625 --> 01:10:26.667
Come on.

1380
01:10:27.792 --> 01:10:29.500
Oh... [winces]

1381
01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:31.708
[crying] Pick it up Mary.
please.

1382
01:10:32.333 --> 01:10:34.667
You can do this for me.
right Mary?

1383
01:10:34.708 --> 01:10:35.667
[dramatic music intensifies]

1384
01:10:40.542 --> 01:10:42.542
You can do this for me.
can't you Mary?
