[phone rings]

347
00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:24.565
Mom. I have great news.

348
00:17:24.739 --> 00:17:27.046
[Dylan's mom]
Oh. that's wonderful.
Dilly-Dilly!

349
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.178
Steve and I have good news too!

350
00:17:29.352 --> 00:17:31.485
-Pop!
-[Miles' pop] Boy.
why is you yelling?

351
00:17:31.659 --> 00:17:32.921
I got great news. pop.

352
00:17:33.095 --> 00:17:35.097
Oh. I got something for you too!

353
00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:37.143
-They selected
me for a promotion!
-I was selected for a promotion.

354
00:17:37.317 --> 00:17:38.970
-Well. I mean.
I'm a finalist. but...
-Well. I'm a finalist.

355
00:17:39.145 --> 00:17:41.582
-it's me and this Black guy.
-...it's me and this White dude.

356
00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:43.279
[Miles' pop]
Ooh...

357
00:17:43.453 --> 00:17:47.196
-What this mean. "Ooh"?
-Come on. son.

358
00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.808
Don't be ignorant.
It means your Black-ass
ain't got no chance.

359
00:17:50.982 --> 00:17:53.594
Just because he's Black.
doesn't mean that I--

360
00:17:53.768 --> 00:17:55.813
[Dylan's mom]
Oh. come on. Dilly-Dilly.

361
00:17:55.987 --> 00:17:57.946
You know
how they treat Blacks now!

362
00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.429
All the reversed racism as is.
and discriminated lawsuits.

363
00:18:02.603 --> 00:18:04.344
Oh. God.

364
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:06.172
But I'm good at what I do.

365
00:18:06.346 --> 00:18:08.130
[Miles' pop]
Boy. you ain't shit!

366
00:18:08.304 --> 00:18:10.698
I'm a gardener.
Your granddaddy was a gardener.

367
00:18:10.872 --> 00:18:13.570
Hell. it's probably some old
slave. cotton fields DNA shit.

368
00:18:13.744 --> 00:18:16.051
Word. That's how DNA works. Pop?

369
00:18:16.225 --> 00:18:17.835
[Dylan's mom]
You're the smartest
cookie on the planet.

370
00:18:18.009 --> 00:18:20.055
but minorities
don't have to be as smart

371
00:18:20.229 --> 00:18:21.839
or as talented to get ahead.

372
00:18:22.013 --> 00:18:23.580
It's a colored man's world.

373
00:18:23.754 --> 00:18:25.278
We're just lucky to get gravity.

374
00:18:25.843 --> 00:18:27.193
But I'm good.

375
00:18:27.671 --> 00:18:30.631
You're good.
but you're not Black.

376
00:18:31.849 --> 00:18:34.025
[Miles' pop]
You're doing good.
but don't fool yourself.

377
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.592
It's in the White man's garden.

378
00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:37.290
And we just handle their manure.

379
00:18:37.464 --> 00:18:38.726
[Dylan's mom]
For my good news.

380
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.076
Steve and I are
selling the house!

381
00:18:41.946 --> 00:18:43.600
What do you mean.
"Selling the house"?

382
00:18:43.905 --> 00:18:45.559
Dad bought that land.

383
00:18:45.733 --> 00:18:47.387
He built the house
from the first brick.

384
00:18:47.561 --> 00:18:50.433
Oh. I know. I know.
but Steve wants to take me

385
00:18:50.607 --> 00:18:52.914
to sail the Mexicos.
We need the money.

386
00:18:53.088 --> 00:18:55.482
I told him I am not eating
chimichangas all day.

387
00:18:55.656 --> 00:18:57.179
-but--
-Fuck Steve!

388
00:18:57.353 --> 00:18:58.702
Hey...[scoffs]

389
00:18:59.442 --> 00:19:01.749
Steve was there for me
after your dad passed.

390
00:19:02.358 --> 00:19:03.185
My dad.

391
00:19:04.404 --> 00:19:05.970
Your husband!

392
00:19:06.536 --> 00:19:08.364
30 years. remember?

393
00:19:08.538 --> 00:19:10.932
[Miles' pop]
Oh. Mr. Rubin
from the center called.

394
00:19:11.106 --> 00:19:13.717
Said the donations dried up and
they have to close the doors.

395
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:17.156
What? When was this?
If they close. those kids
will be on the streets.

396
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.507
-Their biz. not mine.
-My tech kids have been
busting their asses

397
00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:22.291
for the Robo-Tech Competition
next month.

398
00:19:22.465 --> 00:19:24.337
and they were building
a kids' size Voltron.

399
00:19:24.511 --> 00:19:25.903
He said unless you come up

400
00:19:26.077 --> 00:19:27.992
with the entry
and transport fees.

401
00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:31.387
-y'all have to withdraw.
-Those kids' future
depends on this.

402
00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:33.520
-I'll get the money.
-I'm gonna get the money.

403
00:19:33.998 --> 00:19:36.436
-I'm gonna get that promotion.
-I'm gonna get that promotion.

[machine whirring]

405
00:19:41.528 --> 00:19:43.007
-Have you been working out?
-No.

406
00:19:43.791 --> 00:19:47.360
-Been on any good dates lately?
-Like with real women? Also no.

407
00:19:48.317 --> 00:19:52.278
Well. what if I set you up with
this spicy little Latin number?

408
00:19:52.452 --> 00:19:54.149
Is this some sort
of green card scam?

409
00:19:54.323 --> 00:19:56.020
No. God. no.

410
00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.197
She is super American.

411
00:20:01.983 --> 00:20:04.028
-How American?
-Like...

412
00:20:04.464 --> 00:20:07.336
watching Pitch Perfectwith
a cold slice of pumpkin pie...

413
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.773

And a dollop
of cinnamon whipped cream!

[both laugh]

415
00:20:11.688 --> 00:20:14.691
Well. make sure
she's got the spicy.

416
00:20:14.865 --> 00:20:18.129
because I got
the curry for sure-y.

417
00:20:18.304 --> 00:20:21.132
-Chic-chica!
-[distorted voice] Oh. yeah!

418
00:20:22.525 --> 00:20:25.224
I don't fucking get it.

419
00:20:26.094 --> 00:20:29.053
There's money
and there's bullshit.

420
00:20:29.402 --> 00:20:31.230
Which one do you think
I prefer to talk about?

421
00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:33.493
I'm not my dad.

First things first.
Lainee. crack run.

Don't make my day any worse.

426
00:20:43.372 --> 00:20:45.679
I don't have time
for all the formalities.

427
00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:48.072
So. I merged
your two interviews together.

428
00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:50.597
You have three words or less.

429
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:51.989
preferably less.

430
00:20:52.163 --> 00:20:53.513
to tell me why you want the job.

431
00:20:54.557 --> 00:20:57.038
No fake work bullshit. okay? Go.

432
00:20:57.778 --> 00:21:01.477
Uh... Mom selling dad!

Center shut down!

435

First. second. Though.
you were both so underwhelming.

436
00:21:11.313 --> 00:21:15.186
You know what? I don't need
another soft-ass Will.

437
00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:17.667
I need a fucking killer.

438

Someone that's going to help
this company hide a body...

439
00:21:21.845 --> 00:21:22.977
if we need to.

440
00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:26.763
-Maybe I misjudged--
-[phone buzzing]

441
00:21:27.677 --> 00:21:29.113
Hey. Jim.

442
00:21:30.158 --> 00:21:33.074
Good to hear from you too!
You both failed.

443
00:21:34.641 --> 00:21:36.904
That means get the fuck out!

444
00:21:37.948 --> 00:21:40.516
Oh. so sad about Will.

445
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.693
Yeah. we're all still
just reeling over here.

446
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.566
I can't stop crying... Yeah.

[whimsical music]

448
00:21:50.134 --> 00:21:51.266
Okay.

449
00:21:52.006 --> 00:21:54.835
It's okay. alright? Peop--
People get fired every day.

450
00:21:55.009 --> 00:21:58.447
If the boss wants her fired...
"You're out of here!"

451
00:21:59.448 --> 00:22:01.320
Better her than me.

452
00:22:01.494 --> 00:22:03.670
I do my job.
and I do it damn good.

453

Ever since little Harry
was second grade
pencil sharpening monitor.

454
00:22:07.021 --> 00:22:09.153
You think anybody had any
pencil pokes that year?
Any lead poisoning?

455
00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:11.721
Not on my watch.
Not on my watch!

-Brendan!
-Gah!

Uh. your speech.
it was inspiring.

00:22:17.292 --> 00:22:19.120
it got my adrenaline pumping.

459
00:22:19.294 --> 00:22:21.862
Um. you have something...

460
00:22:25.431 --> 00:22:26.954
No. it's--

461
00:22:27.955 --> 00:22:29.870
-Still?
-Uh. it's more...

You need to run

465
00:22:39.053 --> 00:22:39.967
I need to mask up...

466
00:22:41.838 --> 00:22:43.623
and then go fire a bitch.

00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:48.062
It couldn't be that bad.

469
00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:51.718
Bad is driving your dad's car
into the Whomping Willow.

470
00:22:51.892 --> 00:22:53.197
I'd take that over this any day.

471
00:22:54.024 --> 00:22:57.637
It's like Harry playing
Quidditch without his Firebolt.

472

Damn! Seriously?

473
00:23:01.292 --> 00:23:04.818
I could've done better selling
Black Lives Matter shirts
at a tea party rally.

474
00:23:04.992 --> 00:23:08.343
If it means anything.
Ami said I came in first.

you don't even recognize
your own cock anymore.

-What do you mean?
-I mean. look at them.

for fucking ever.

And that's why
they have power everywhere.

they're not in power anywhere?
