activation request.

39
00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.103
- Ryan.

40
00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:49.104
- [Operator] Confirmed.

41
00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:50.773
Connecting you now.

42
00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:52.191
- [Man] Ryan. hello.

43
00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:54.193
This is Peter Ward
for mission briefing.

44
00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.070
- I usually work with DeGarza.

45
00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.031
- You like to swim.
I love swimming.

46
00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:01.283
Yeah. swimming with beautiful
women. that's the saying.

47
00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:05.287
No.

48
00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:07.790
- Do you have a tab?

49
00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:10.709
- No. I've been using
your man's tab all night.

50
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:12.461
- [Peter] For now.
I am handling

51
00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:14.505
all of DeGarza's
client accounts.

52
00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:16.006
How is St. Martin?

53
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.717
- St. Martin is great.
My team deserves it.

54
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:21.428
- [Peter] Yes. I heard
about Venezuela.

55
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.013
You guys did a good job.

56
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:24.932
- We were hoping
to stay for a while.

57
00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.934
but I'm guessing this
isn't a courtesy call.

58
00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.269
- You know. I was working on
that girl for like 30 minutes.

59
00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:30.354
- I saved her.

60
00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.314
- Yeah. you saved
her from a good time.

61
00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.192
- [Peter] A VIP client activated
their emergency GPS beacon.

62
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.777
You are the closest
extraction team.

63
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.278
- Any other communications?

64
00:04:38.362 --> 00:04:39.321
- [Peter] Negative.

65
00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:41.532
Total communication
blackout on the island.

66
00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.200
Only the GPS beacon.

67
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.452
- Copy that.

68
00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:46.787
- [Peter] Sending
you the package now.

69
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.205
How soon can you go?

70
00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:49.873
- We'll leave at dawn.

71
00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:51.125
- [Peter] Excellent.

72
00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:53.293
Let me know when
you're on your way.

73
00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:54.670
- Will do.

74
00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:55.921
- [Peter] Copy that.

75
00:04:59.008 --> 00:05:00.300
- Not a long time.

76
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.594
- Hey. I will have you know

77
00:05:02.678 --> 00:05:04.304
it is a perfectly
average amount of time

78
00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:05.639
that I like to utilize.

79
00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:07.433
- I'm sure.
- "I'm sure."

80
00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:10.102
Oh no. I know that look.

81
00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.229
That is "we're going
back to work" look.

82
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.647
- Yep.

83
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.357
Where's Sarah?

84
00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.401
- She's picking Jordan
up at the airport.

85
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.446
- So. boss. how
much time we got?

86
00:05:21.447 --> 00:05:23.949
- Unfortunately. not enough.

87
00:05:25.034 --> 00:05:26.160
It's back to work.

88
00:05:27.453 --> 00:05:30.372
(ominous tempo music)

89
00:05:30.456 --> 00:05:33.625
(boat horn blowing)

90
00:05:37.755 --> 00:05:39.757
(crickets chirping)

91
00:05:47.723 --> 00:05:50.392
(ominous tempo music)

92
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.773
- Got your text.

93
00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.214
- Welcome back. brother.

94
00:06:21.048 --> 00:06:22.091
Good to see you.

95
00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:26.929
You can put your stuff
in the back.

96
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:37.314
- You think he's
ready to come back?

97
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.774
- He's here. isn't he?

98
00:06:45.656 --> 00:06:48.617
(ocean waves sloshing)

99
00:06:50.536 --> 00:06:53.372
- Northeast of Barbados we'll
fly into a hidden island.

100
00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:54.832
Esperanca.

101
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.502
It's an exclusive island reserved
for the rich and powerful.

102
00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:01.171
Less than a thousand people.
even at its most crowded.

103
00:07:02.548 --> 00:07:05.676
Has a couple of resorts.
small urban center.

104
00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:09.638
and lots of big homes owned
by very wealthy people.

105
00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:12.099
- Our client. Laura Hamilton.

106
00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:14.309
widow of tech billionaire
Lloyd Hamilton.

107
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.436
He was assassinated
a year ago in Prague.

108
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.481
so she fled to Esperanca
and has been in hiding ever since.

109
00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:22.359
Her mansion is secluded and far
away from the main resorts

110
00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.652
and the main city.

111
00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.904
- Are there any photos
of the mansion

112
00:07:25.988 --> 00:07:27.406
that we can use for reference?

113
00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:28.574
- Nope.

114
00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:30.576
The elites like to hide
from the world here.

115
00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:32.786
They pay a lot of money
to make sure this place is

116
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.746
off the grid and out
of Google Maps.

117
00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:37.499
- All right.

118
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:40.794
We go in. get the clients
and get out.

119
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.462
Three hours. tops.

120
00:07:42.838 --> 00:07:45.966
We land like civilians so we
don't draw too much attention.

121
00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.760
Jordan. you're on over watch.

122
00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:52.389
Leo. you'll monitor
the client's GPS location.

123
00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:53.891
We're going in blind. people.

124
00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.185
So stay sharp and be
ready for anything.

125
00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.561
- Yee-haw.

126
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:00.522
- Let's do this.

127
00:08:00.606 --> 00:08:01.732
(gun cranking)

128
00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:09.156
(lively tempo music)

129
00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:22.836
(phone ringing)

130
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.176
- Ryan.

131
00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.594
- [Peter] We've
lost the GPS beacon.

132
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:31.929
What is your status?

133
00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.013
- On route.

134
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:34.848
30 minutes out from the island.

135
00:08:34.932 --> 00:08:36.058
- [Peter] Excellent.
Update me

136
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:37.476
as soon as you
have the client secure.

137
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.518
- Will do.

138
00:08:38.602 --> 00:08:39.561
- [Peter] Copy that.

139
00:08:40.312 --> 00:08:43.315
(lively tempo music)

140
00:08:57.663 --> 00:09:01.166
(dramatic vocalization music)

141
00:09:23.981 --> 00:09:26.984
(ominous tempo music)

142
00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:32.197
(computer beeping)

143
00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:38.203
(eerie music)

144
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.538
(ominous tempo music)

145
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.925
- Well. a lot less
people than I expected.

146
00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.308
- Let's gear up
and clear the building.

147
00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:43.477
(suspenseful tempo music)

148
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.812
(guns cranking)

149
00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:33.819
(lively tempo music)

150
00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:12.941
(Sarah screaming)

151
00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:14.776
(electronic humming)

152
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.116
(Ryan groaning)

153
00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:27.456
(eerie music)

154
00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:31.460
(Ryan grunting)

155
00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:32.836
- Talk to me. brother.

156
00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:33.879
Talk to me!

157
00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.755
(Ryan groaning)

158
00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.048
- You hear it?

159
00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:38.133
- Hear what?

160
00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.093
- That fucking noise.

161
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.807
(Leo gasping)

162
00:12:47.476 --> 00:12:49.227
(ominous music)

163
00:12:49.311 --> 00:12:50.770
- What the fuck was that?

164
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:52.564
What the fuck was that?

165
00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.906
- Let's find the others.

166
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.291
- What the hell was that?

167
00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:13.710
- No idea.

168
00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:18.965
Did you guys hear that?

169
00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:19.925
- Yeah.

170
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.301
- Yeah. it wasn't
a fucking siren.

171
00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:22.552
- You did too?

172
00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.140
The network functions
have been disabled.

173
00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.142
Can you check your device?

174
00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.144
- Can these things be
shut down remotely?

175
00:13:31.228 --> 00:13:33.480
- It can be but that's
some high level shit.

176
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.525
The Hamiltons' GPS location
hasn't changed

177
00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.902
since this morning but I can't
get it to update now!

178
00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:43.114
Somebody put us in the dark.

179
00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.242
(foreboding music)

180
00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:46.743
- We stick to the plan.

181
00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:48.495
Find the client.

182
00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:49.913
Let's move out.

183
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:55.627
(lively tempo music)

184
00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:01.716
(computer beeping)

185
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.344
(eerie music)

186
00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:38.628
- Vehicle ahead.

187
00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:01.276
- Don't touch that.

188
00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:06.740
(eerie music)

189
00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.126
- We're good?

190
00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:21.713
- That's strange.

191
00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:23.548
When I touched it back there.

192
00:15:23.632 --> 00:15:24.966
that's when the noise went off.

193
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.554
- [Ryan] Let's move.

194
00:15:29.638 --> 00:15:31.181
- [Leo] Hit it like a
red-headed step child!

195
00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:32.390
Woo!

196
00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:34.809
(engine rumbling)

197
00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:41.024
(ominous music)

198
00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:53.495
(lively tempo music)

199
00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:28.613
Oh. shit.

200
00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.491
- What's the holdup?

201
00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:32.742
- Code's not working.

202
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:37.956
- Leo!

203
00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.374
- Give me a goddamn second!

204
00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.127
Sorry. boss.

205
00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:51.553
(electronic beeping)

206
00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.520
- [Ryan] Leo?

207
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.814
- One second. hold on.

208
00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:03.815
We're in.

209
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.151
(gate clanking)

210
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:15.702
(atmosphere humming)
(man indistinctly shouting)

211
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.957
(eerie music)

212
00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:28.465
- [Ryan] Slower.

213
00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:30.675
(atmosphere whooshing)

214
00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:32.886
- [Man] You're not my son!

215
00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:36.014
(atmosphere whooshing)

216
00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.442
(atmosphere humming)

217
00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:52.864
(ocean waves rumbling)

218
00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.293
(eerie music)

219
00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:08.379
(computer beeping)

220
00:18:12.675 --> 00:18:16.095
(lively drumming music)

221
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.872
(gentle tempo music)

222
00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:37.260
(atmosphere buzzing)

223
00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.225
- Leo.

224
00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:54.527
(ocean waves sloshing)

225
00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:03.828
(eerie music)

226
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:09.250
(children screaming)
(rollercoaster clattering)

227
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.128
- [Man] We need to sedate
this piece of shit!

228
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:13.671
You're not my son!

229
00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:16.841
(atmosphere rumbling)

230
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:20.178
(police siren)

231
00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:22.263
- What's happening?

232
00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.850
(atmosphere ringing)

233
00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:29.646
(ominous music)

234
00:20:30.104 --> 00:20:31.064
- You okay?

235
00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:35.234
- Yeah.

236
00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.237
Yeah. I'm fine.
I'm good. let's go.

237
00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:39.447
- Okay.

238
00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:42.033
(Sarah huffing)

239
00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:48.957
(eerie music)

240
00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:51.459
(Leo grunting)

241
00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:02.178
- Okay.

242
00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:05.640
(gentle tempo music)

243
00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:56.733
(fan buzzing)

244
00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:04.574
(woman screaming)

245
00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.994
- Hey! It's okay!

246
00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:10.580
I'm with Castle International.
I'm here to help you!

247
00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:12.582
It's okay!
Calm down!

248
00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:13.708
- Okay.

249
00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:15.918
- I'm here to help you.
I promise. I promise.

250
00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:18.379
- I can't hear anymore!

251
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:19.630
I can't!

252
00:22:19.714 --> 00:22:21.215
- It's okay.
It's okay!

253
00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:22.508
It's okay. calm down!

254
00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:23.468
- Okay.

255
00:22:26.054 --> 00:22:27.638
- [Laura] The light
took everyone.

256
00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:29.640
- You're injured.
you're injured. okay?

257
00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:31.225
Let me see.
Let me see.

258
00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:33.436
(Laura crying)

259
00:22:36.272 --> 00:22:37.857
- I tried to stop it.

260
00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:39.025
- Stop what?

261
00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:40.693
The waves?

262
00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:45.239
- Now I can't hear it anymore.

263
00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:47.450
- [Leila] It's okay. it's okay.

264
00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:50.119
- But it doesn't matter.

265
00:22:52.288 --> 00:22:53.790
It's already inside.

266
00:22:54.624 --> 00:22:55.958
- It's okay. Laura.

267
00:22:56.042 --> 00:22:57.460
You're safe with us. okay?

268
00:22:57.543 --> 00:22:59.378
We can figure this out
on the boat.

269
00:23:04.592 --> 00:23:05.676
- No one is safe.

270
00:23:07.261 --> 00:23:08.429
No one.

271
00:23:08.513 --> 00:23:11.724
(eerie music)

272
00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:18.856
- You ever hear
of Havana Syndrome?

273
00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:20.399
- Yeah.

274
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.485
Yeah.

275
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:25.613
Something about U.S. diplomats
in Cuban getting sick

276
00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:27.990
and blaming it on sound waves.

277
00:23:28.074 --> 00:23:29.283
- Ultrasound.

278
00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:30.701
RF energy.

279
00:23:31.536 --> 00:23:34.747
High frequencies beyond
our range of hearing.

280
00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:37.625
Causes all sorts of problems
in the neural pathways.

281
00:23:39.085 --> 00:23:42.130
- Well. whatever it is.
we can hear it.

282
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.090
and this ain't Havana.

283
00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:46.509
- See. that's the problem
here. boss.

284
00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:49.137
You don't know if it is
or isn't affecting you

285
00:23:50.221 --> 00:23:51.681
until it's too late.

286
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.145
- You're creeping me out. Leo.

287
00:23:57.311 --> 00:23:58.437
Save it for the debrief.

288
00:23:58.521 --> 00:23:59.480
Let's move out!

289
00:23:59.647 --> 00:24:02.024
(suspenseful music)

290
00:24:02.733 --> 00:24:04.527
(engine rumbling)

291
00:24:15.913 --> 00:24:16.998
Why are we stopping?

292
00:24:20.668 --> 00:24:22.128
- I secured that gate.

293
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:25.506
(electrical fizzling)

294
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.552
(Laura screaming)

295
00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:37.518
(gunshots popping)

296
00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:40.021
- Client's shot. client's shot!

297
00:24:40.104 --> 00:24:41.397
- [Ryan] Do we have a visual?

298
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.440
- I got nothing!

299
00:24:42.523 --> 00:24:43.566
- How's she doing back there?

300
00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.526
- [Sarah] I don't think
she's gonna make it!

301
00:24:46.068 --> 00:24:47.153
- [Leo] We gotta move!

302
00:24:49.363 --> 00:24:51.199
(eerie music)

303
00:24:51.699 --> 00:24:52.950
Let's move. let's move!

304
00:24:54.535 --> 00:24:56.078
We gotta move!

305
00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:05.588
(suspenseful music)

306
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.807
- [Ryan] How's she
doing back there?

307
00:25:16.891 --> 00:25:18.142
- No good!

308
00:25:18.476 --> 00:25:20.937
(suspenseful music)

309
00:25:21.395 --> 00:25:23.231
(indistinct shouting)

310
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.109
- [Ryan] Go.

311
00:25:27.193 --> 00:25:28.778
- Fuck.
- Leila. move. come on!

312
00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:30.988
Leila. there's a medic bag
in my bag.

313
00:25:31.072 --> 00:25:32.114
- [Ryan] You got her?

314
00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:33.324
- Ryan!

315
00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:34.825
Ryan?
- Yeah?

316
00:25:36.244 --> 00:25:37.828
Where's that medical kit?

317
00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:41.332
(lively tempo music)

318
00:25:41.874 --> 00:25:43.793
- Shit. fuck. fuck.

319
00:25:44.502 --> 00:25:46.170
Fuck. she's not responding.

320
00:25:46.254 --> 00:25:47.630
Fuck! No!

321
00:25:47.964 --> 00:25:49.131
- [Ryan] Leila.

322
00:25:49.423 --> 00:25:51.384
(Leila huffing)

323
00:25:57.014 --> 00:25:58.015
- Fuck.

324
00:25:58.933 --> 00:25:59.809
- [Ryan] Stop!

325
00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:00.768
- [Leila] Fuck.

326
00:26:00.851 --> 00:26:02.019
- Leila. stop!

327
00:26:02.103 --> 00:26:03.020
She's gone!

328
00:26:03.104 --> 00:26:04.647
Leila. she's gone.

329
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.026
- Fuck!

330
00:26:09.527 --> 00:26:12.530
(ominous music)

331
00:26:21.872 --> 00:26:24.959
(melancholic music)

332
00:26:45.062 --> 00:26:47.565
- Boss. I'm gonna
go get the boat.

333
00:26:49.525 --> 00:26:50.776
- Keep your eyes open.

334
00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:51.944
- [Leo] Shit.

335
00:26:52.236 --> 00:26:53.487
For what?

336
00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:01.996
- It was a mistake.

337
00:27:04.165 --> 00:27:06.500
Should've never asked
you to bring Jordan back.

338
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.254
Wasn't ready.

339
00:27:12.673 --> 00:27:14.425
Just froze in the car.

340
00:27:23.726 --> 00:27:24.727
- Doesn't matter.

341
00:27:28.606 --> 00:27:30.399
Let's go home.
the mission's over.

342
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.322
(melancholic music)

343
00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:58.803
(alarm beeping)

344
00:27:58.886 --> 00:28:00.262
- Hit the snooze.

345
00:28:00.596 --> 00:28:02.473
I need 10 more minutes.

346
00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:07.895
I love you.

347
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.783
(foreboding music)

348
00:28:40.136 --> 00:28:41.387
- No. no. no.

349
00:28:41.637 --> 00:28:42.680
Where's the boat?

350
00:28:42.763 --> 00:28:44.265
The boat is fucking gone!

351
00:28:45.391 --> 00:28:47.143
Where the shit are you?

352
00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:49.687
Fuck.

353
00:28:49.979 --> 00:28:52.273
- [Man] Where you
wandering off to. boy?

354
00:28:52.356 --> 00:28:54.066
Think you can turn
your back on me?

355
00:28:55.401 --> 00:28:57.570
(Leo mumbling)

356
00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:01.282
- Come on. Leo.

357
00:29:01.365 --> 00:29:02.741
Come on. snap out of it.

358
00:29:02.825 --> 00:29:04.577
He's not real.
he's fucking dead.

359
00:29:05.327 --> 00:29:06.996
He's a dead piece of shit.

360
00:29:08.164 --> 00:29:09.457
He's fucking dead.

361
00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.167
He's fucking dead.

362
00:29:14.712 --> 00:29:16.380
Fucking damn it.

363
00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:27.349
(eerie music)

364
00:29:57.213 --> 00:30:01.467
(unsettling music)

365
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.894
(Leila groaning)

366
00:30:25.741 --> 00:30:27.159
(Leila groaning)

367
00:30:37.503 --> 00:30:40.506
(unsettling music)

368
00:31:11.287 --> 00:31:14.999
(ominous music)

369
00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:27.386
- What's she doing?

370
00:31:29.096 --> 00:31:31.390
(lively tempo music)

371
00:31:38.647 --> 00:31:39.607
Leila?

372
00:31:41.984 --> 00:31:43.777
(music intensifying)

373
00:31:45.321 --> 00:31:46.280
Leila?

374
00:31:48.407 --> 00:31:49.575
Leila. no!

375
00:31:49.867 --> 00:31:50.784
(gunshot booming)

376
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:55.039
(dramatic vocalization music)

377
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.426
(Ryan yelling)

378
00:32:19.855 --> 00:32:21.899
(Ryan screaming)

379
00:32:22.983 --> 00:32:25.319
(dramatic vocalization music)

380
00:32:52.763 --> 00:32:56.767
(gentle piano music)

381
00:33:06.193 --> 00:33:08.028
(bird squawking)

382
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.076
(crickets chirping)

383
00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:25.003
- We need to find
a way off this nightmare.

384
00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:31.260
I'm gonna talk to him.

385
00:33:31.343 --> 00:33:32.428
- Leave him be.

386
00:33:36.515 --> 00:33:38.267
- How much longer. huh?

387
00:33:39.184 --> 00:33:40.811
It's been hours.

388
00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:47.234
- You know.

389
00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:52.114
when I lost Naomi. I didn't
speak to anyone for months.

390
00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:00.122
- Are you okay?

391
00:34:02.166 --> 00:34:03.083
- I'm fine.

392
00:34:04.918 --> 00:34:05.878
- Because...

393
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.506
when we got to the beach.

394
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.091
you didn't even get
out of the car. you--

395
00:34:11.175 --> 00:34:12.217
- I said I'm fine!

396
00:34:14.928 --> 00:34:18.474
(gentle music)

397
00:34:42.414 --> 00:34:43.707
- Boss. I...

398
00:34:49.505 --> 00:34:53.550
- Are we finally gonna talk
about what the fuck is going on?

399
00:34:54.718 --> 00:34:55.594
Huh?

400
00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:58.889
About this empty island!

401
00:34:58.972 --> 00:35:01.934
About the fucking sound.
the fucking sound!

402
00:35:02.935 --> 00:35:05.312
- That sound is freaking
me the fuck out.

403
00:35:06.605 --> 00:35:08.774
All right. it jammed
our communications.

404
00:35:11.026 --> 00:35:12.486
It could be some advanced tech.

405
00:35:12.569 --> 00:35:15.030
- Who?
Who's advanced tech. huh?

406
00:35:15.113 --> 00:35:16.907
- I don't know. I don't know!

407
00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:18.951
The Chinese?

408
00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:21.245
It's the Russians.
the goddamn U.S. Government.

409
00:35:21.328 --> 00:35:22.246
- Fucking Chinese?

410
00:35:22.329 --> 00:35:24.081
The fucking Chinese.
that doesn't even make sense!

411
00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:25.249
- I don't fucking know. Sarah.

412
00:35:25.332 --> 00:35:27.000
don't yell at me. huh?
- Fuck you!

413
00:35:27.084 --> 00:35:28.794
- Don't fucking yell at me! Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

414
00:35:28.877 --> 00:35:29.837
- Hey!

415
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.421
- Fuck!
- Hey!

416
00:35:35.717 --> 00:35:36.718
Does it matter?

417
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:39.763
- Does it fucking matter?

418
00:35:41.223 --> 00:35:42.349
Look where we are.

419
00:35:44.434 --> 00:35:48.897
- Wow. we need to get
off of this island.

420
00:35:49.189 --> 00:35:51.149
Okay. before the same thing
that happened to Leila

421
00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:52.609
happens to us. okay?

422
00:35:54.945 --> 00:35:57.155
I'm fucking losing it.

423
00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.533
I saw Samuel.

424
00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:03.787
Fucking flash. I saw
a flash and saw Samuel

425
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:06.748
and I saw the day he
fucking died at the house.

426
00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:08.709
I'm fucking going crazy.

427
00:36:08.792 --> 00:36:10.335
- Sarah. I've seen
the same shit.

428
00:36:10.419 --> 00:36:13.213
Okay. okay. yeah. I don't
think you're going crazy. okay?

429
00:36:13.297 --> 00:36:15.549
After I heard the sound.
I've been hearing my dad.

430
00:36:16.258 --> 00:36:19.094
And that abusive piece
of shit used to beat me.

431
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:21.805
beat my sisters and my mom.

432
00:36:22.806 --> 00:36:24.182
and now it's all
I fucking hear.

433
00:36:26.852 --> 00:36:28.437
It's gotta be something here.

434
00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:31.773
Boss?

435
00:36:33.817 --> 00:36:34.943
- Me too.

436
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.155
I've been hearing...

437
00:36:39.615 --> 00:36:40.824
children screaming.

438
00:36:42.576 --> 00:36:43.660
Drowning.

439
00:36:46.413 --> 00:36:47.581
Like back in New Orleans

440
00:36:47.664 --> 00:36:49.541
when I was stationed
there during Katrina.

441
00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:52.252
- Yeah. but you didn't
even hear a sound.

442
00:36:55.881 --> 00:36:56.965
- No.

443
00:36:57.215 --> 00:36:58.216
Nothing.

444
00:37:00.469 --> 00:37:02.095
But whatever's going
on with you guys.

445
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.641
I have a strange feeling it's coming
from the top of that mountain.

446
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:10.771
- Power.

447
00:37:12.022 --> 00:37:13.148
Yeah?

448
00:37:13.982 --> 00:37:16.652
We cut off their power
and we disable

449
00:37:16.818 --> 00:37:19.404
whatever the fucking
source of that sound is.

450
00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:25.118
- All right.

451
00:37:26.745 --> 00:37:27.955
Let's give it a shot.

452
00:37:29.081 --> 00:37:30.832
So we cut
the power to the island

453
00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:32.751
then try to find the source.

454
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.128
We make whoever's
responsible pay.

455
00:37:36.088 --> 00:37:38.590
(ominous music)

456
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.493
(crickets chirping)

457
00:38:08.912 --> 00:38:10.539
(creature screeching)

458
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.917
(eerie music)

459
00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.838
(glass clinking)

460
00:38:30.142 --> 00:38:31.184
Keep moving.

461
00:38:31.768 --> 00:38:33.103
(creature growling)

462
00:38:39.818 --> 00:38:42.029
(distant metal clanking)

463
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.783
(ominous tempo music)

464
00:39:01.131 --> 00:39:02.340
(distant metal clanking)

465
00:39:08.513 --> 00:39:09.973
(creature screeching)

466
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:14.352
(crickets chirping)

467
00:39:24.696 --> 00:39:27.783
(lively tempo music)

468
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.915
(distant glass crackling)

469
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.469
Exit left.

470
00:39:50.514 --> 00:39:53.517
(lively tempo music)

471
00:40:09.866 --> 00:40:12.869
(crickets chirping)

472
00:40:17.457 --> 00:40:20.460
(lively tempo music)

473
00:40:36.726 --> 00:40:40.730
(screams echoing)

474
00:40:49.364 --> 00:40:53.285
(rollercoaster rails clanking)

475
00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:59.457
(screams echoing)

476
00:41:04.754 --> 00:41:07.757
(ominous music)

477
00:41:21.855 --> 00:41:22.898
- Help me.

478
00:41:25.442 --> 00:41:26.610
Help me.

479
00:41:32.365 --> 00:41:33.783
- I'm so sorry.

480
00:41:33.992 --> 00:41:35.577
I'm really sorry. I tried.

481
00:41:36.077 --> 00:41:38.622
(police sirens echoing)

482
00:41:38.705 --> 00:41:40.290
- (Ryan mumbling)
- [Girl] Help me.

483
00:41:41.208 --> 00:41:44.211
(dramatic music)

484
00:42:01.937 --> 00:42:05.232
(Ryan mumbling)

485
00:42:07.567 --> 00:42:08.818
- I'm so sorry.

486
00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:11.988
I tried.

487
00:42:14.574 --> 00:42:15.617
I really tried.

488
00:42:17.827 --> 00:42:19.496
I couldn't do anything.

489
00:42:20.664 --> 00:42:23.667
(dramatic music)

490
00:42:25.126 --> 00:42:26.086
Just...

491
00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:31.007
There was nothing I could do.

492
00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:34.886
(dramatic music)

493
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.373
- Hold up.

494
00:43:05.959 --> 00:43:07.085
We've lost Ryan.

495
00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:12.924
(eerie music)

496
00:43:29.441 --> 00:43:32.736
(computer beeping)
(creature growling)

497
00:43:35.697 --> 00:43:37.073
- Help me.

498
00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:43.288
(Ryan crying)

499
00:43:45.415 --> 00:43:46.416
- I'm sorry.

500
00:43:50.211 --> 00:43:51.296
I tried.

501
00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:54.257
I really tried.

502
00:43:57.594 --> 00:44:00.221
(foreboding music)

503
00:44:06.102 --> 00:44:08.104
(atmosphere whooshing)

504
00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:11.941
- Ryan!

505
00:44:12.567 --> 00:44:14.652
(music intensifying)

506
00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:16.946
(computer beeping)

507
00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:20.825
(thunder rumbling)
(Ryan screaming)

508
00:44:22.077 --> 00:44:24.371
(lively music)

509
00:44:25.372 --> 00:44:26.831
- What the?

510
00:44:31.878 --> 00:44:33.713
(eerie music)

511
00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:37.175
- Fall back.
(Sarah crying)

512
00:44:37.258 --> 00:44:38.301
Fall back!

513
00:44:39.052 --> 00:44:41.262
- What the fuck is happening?

514
00:44:41.346 --> 00:44:44.349
(suspenseful music)

515
00:44:51.439 --> 00:44:52.440
What is that?

516
00:44:52.899 --> 00:44:55.026
(creature growling)

517
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.070
What is that?

518
00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:00.323
(suspenseful music)

519
00:45:12.919 --> 00:45:16.297
(door rattling)

520
00:45:21.636 --> 00:45:22.971
(electronic humming)

521
00:45:23.054 --> 00:45:24.639
(creature growling)

522
00:45:42.574 --> 00:45:44.826
(creature snarling)

523
00:45:57.505 --> 00:46:02.302
(electronic humming)

524
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.766
(door thudding)

525
00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:17.775
(eerie music)

526
00:46:19.402 --> 00:46:20.695
Clear.

527
00:46:28.369 --> 00:46:32.290
- Don't you ever
fucking touch me again.

528
00:46:35.502 --> 00:46:37.253
- We wanna leave.
we gotta go now.

529
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.839
Right now.

530
00:46:42.592 --> 00:46:45.178
(foreboding music)

531
00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:49.974
(lively tempo music)

532
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.703
(eerie music)

533
00:47:32.684 --> 00:47:35.687
(intense music)

534
00:47:56.708 --> 00:47:58.459
(gun cranking)

535
00:48:02.755 --> 00:48:05.425
(lively tempo music)

536
00:48:45.965 --> 00:48:48.968
(suspenseful tempo music)

537
00:48:57.644 --> 00:49:00.063
(Sarah crying)

538
00:49:11.532 --> 00:49:12.825
- Power here.

539
00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:14.577
Set it up.

540
00:49:15.036 --> 00:49:18.206
Which would feed me into five.

541
00:49:18.706 --> 00:49:19.832
six.

542
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.963
(ominous music)

543
00:49:39.519 --> 00:49:40.603
No.

544
00:49:44.607 --> 00:49:46.234
No. no. no. no.

545
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:51.072
(Leo groaning)

546
00:49:53.366 --> 00:49:54.367
Come on.

547
00:49:54.617 --> 00:49:56.661
Come on. come on. come on.

548
00:49:56.744 --> 00:49:58.705
No. no. no. no.

549
00:50:00.123 --> 00:50:02.333
(foreboding music)

550
00:50:03.459 --> 00:50:04.460
Uh...

551
00:50:05.837 --> 00:50:08.256
This is. this is strange.

552
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:09.882
- What's strange?

553
00:50:10.383 --> 00:50:11.467
- Um...

554
00:50:12.093 --> 00:50:17.181
These are the power relays
for the whole island and.

555
00:50:18.182 --> 00:50:21.811
you know. everything
feeds through here but...

556
00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:23.396
it's not...

557
00:50:26.149 --> 00:50:27.108
I...

558
00:50:29.944 --> 00:50:31.279
It's not working. boss.

559
00:50:33.281 --> 00:50:35.199
- [Sarah] What is wrong
with you both?

560
00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:41.289
Did you see what
happened back there?

561
00:50:41.539 --> 00:50:44.500
(gentle music)

562
00:50:44.584 --> 00:50:45.585
Are you blind?

563
00:50:47.128 --> 00:50:49.213
Did you not see
what happened to Ryan?

564
00:50:51.174 --> 00:50:52.467
It's hopeless.

565
00:50:55.386 --> 00:50:56.721
It's hopeless.

566
00:50:57.805 --> 00:51:00.391
(Sarah crying)

567
00:51:03.853 --> 00:51:06.481
Whatever you try to do.
it's not gonna work.

568
00:51:08.024 --> 00:51:11.235
- Sarah. we're trying
to get us off the island.

569
00:51:16.282 --> 00:51:20.912
- What's ever happening here.
it's beyond our understanding.

570
00:51:23.122 --> 00:51:24.540
Our focus is to survive.

571
00:51:26.584 --> 00:51:27.919
- We're already dead.

572
00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:30.421
(radio buzzing)

573
00:51:30.505 --> 00:51:31.672
- [Man] Anyone out there?

574
00:51:35.843 --> 00:51:37.178
- Don't touch that.

575
00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:40.097
Don't touch that.

576
00:51:40.515 --> 00:51:41.641
It's a trap.

577
00:51:41.724 --> 00:51:42.767
Just don't!

578
00:51:44.477 --> 00:51:45.478
- Hey.

579
00:51:50.358 --> 00:51:51.484
- Stand down.

580
00:51:59.408 --> 00:52:01.994
(gentle music)

581
00:52:03.496 --> 00:52:04.455
Sarah.

582
00:52:05.248 --> 00:52:06.207
Breathe.

583
00:52:06.332 --> 00:52:09.335
(Sarah heavily breathing)

584
00:52:16.676 --> 00:52:18.594
Do you remember
the first time that we met?

585
00:52:20.346 --> 00:52:23.099
(gentle piano music)

586
00:52:23.391 --> 00:52:27.103
I was standing at the bar
and Samuel was next to me.

587
00:52:29.438 --> 00:52:31.023
He couldn't take
his eyes off you.

588
00:52:34.569 --> 00:52:36.279
And you were standing
in the corner.

589
00:52:38.489 --> 00:52:40.575
the way that you would
look at each other...

590
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:44.120
You were laughing and dancing.

591
00:52:46.998 --> 00:52:48.791
I watched you two fall
in love that night.

592
00:52:48.875 --> 00:52:50.042
(Sarah chuckling)

593
00:52:50.126 --> 00:52:51.127
- Yeah.

594
00:52:55.506 --> 00:52:56.841
- It really showed me...

595
00:52:59.844 --> 00:53:01.345
It showed me how
to fall in love.

596
00:53:03.973 --> 00:53:05.391
And when I met Naomi.

597
00:53:09.812 --> 00:53:11.647
you were no longer with him.

598
00:53:16.485 --> 00:53:18.154
Now close your eyes.

599
00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:20.740
okay?

600
00:53:22.283 --> 00:53:23.326
Rest.

601
00:53:25.286 --> 00:53:26.329
Be present.

602
00:53:29.165 --> 00:53:30.207
And breathe.

603
00:53:32.043 --> 00:53:33.210
Focus on your breath.

604
00:53:35.504 --> 00:53:38.507
(gentle piano music)

605
00:53:45.598 --> 00:53:48.601
(foreboding music)

606
00:53:56.817 --> 00:53:58.736
I'm gonna take the night shift.

607
00:54:09.705 --> 00:54:12.708
(eerie music)

608
00:54:19.382 --> 00:54:20.883
(thunder rumbling)

609
00:54:25.096 --> 00:54:27.431
(intense music)

610
00:54:32.353 --> 00:54:35.356
(birds chirping)

611
00:54:55.751 --> 00:54:58.754
(ominous tempo music)

612
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.636
You good?

613
00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.637
- Yeah.

614
00:55:07.638 --> 00:55:08.639
Where to?

615
00:55:09.932 --> 00:55:12.810
- Well. we're gonna go
see a guy about a walkie.

616
00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.650
(sinister music)

617
00:55:25.448 --> 00:55:28.701
(computer beeping)
(creature breathing)

618
00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:35.082
(ominous tempo music)

619
00:56:09.033 --> 00:56:12.411
(trees crackling)

620
00:56:24.673 --> 00:56:27.676
(eerie music)

621
00:56:53.119 --> 00:56:54.245
(atmosphere rumbling)

622
00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:55.996
- [Father] Sit there.
you miserable piece of shit!

623
00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.623
You're not my son!

624
00:56:58.833 --> 00:57:00.668
Ain't you got any fight in you?

625
00:57:01.252 --> 00:57:02.920
Sit there.
you miserable piece of shit!

626
00:57:03.003 --> 00:57:04.463
You're not my son!

627
00:57:04.713 --> 00:57:06.173
Ain't you got any fight in you?

628
00:57:06.257 --> 00:57:07.925
Hell. your mama was
tougher than you

629
00:57:08.008 --> 00:57:09.051
and I killed that bitch!

630
00:57:12.096 --> 00:57:15.099
(foreboding music)

631
00:57:22.773 --> 00:57:25.776
(computer chiming)

632
00:57:27.987 --> 00:57:30.990
(eerie music)

633
00:57:42.251 --> 00:57:45.254
(ominous tempo music)

634
00:57:59.268 --> 00:58:00.853
(metal clanking)

635
00:58:06.859 --> 00:58:08.986
(object clattering)

636
00:58:14.867 --> 00:58:16.452
(metal clattering)

637
00:58:27.379 --> 00:58:28.839
(objects rustling)

638
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.182
- I spoke to you on the radio.

639
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:40.643
If you can exit the building.

640
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.147
I will give you
to the count of three.

641
00:58:48.067 --> 00:58:49.026
One.

642
00:58:51.278 --> 00:58:52.738
Two.

643
00:58:52.821 --> 00:58:55.824
(ominous music)

644
00:59:02.331 --> 00:59:04.083
- Have you seen them?

645
00:59:04.208 --> 00:59:06.377
- We've seen
a lot of shit. sir.

646
00:59:07.628 --> 00:59:08.879
Come on out.

647
00:59:08.963 --> 00:59:10.464
- That thing from the sky.

648
00:59:12.341 --> 00:59:13.384
That light.

649
00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:18.055
- Mr. Shoenburg.

650
00:59:19.682 --> 00:59:20.641
We're here to help.

651
00:59:21.225 --> 00:59:22.268
- Do you know him?

652
00:59:22.518 --> 00:59:23.978
- Yeah. that's
Albert Shoenburg.

653
00:59:24.061 --> 00:59:26.647
He's a big tech guy
worth about 50 bill.

654
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:28.190
Albert.

655
00:59:30.025 --> 00:59:31.277
My name's Leo.

656
00:59:31.527 --> 00:59:34.405
I'm gonna put my gun
down now. all right?

657
00:59:36.657 --> 00:59:39.076
This is Sarah and Jordan.

658
00:59:39.827 --> 00:59:40.703
Put your gun down.

659
00:59:42.871 --> 00:59:45.874
(eerie music)

660
00:59:53.549 --> 00:59:54.842
All right. we're here to help.

661
00:59:56.302 --> 00:59:57.553
Hey. hey. hey.

662
00:59:57.636 --> 00:59:58.929
Whoa. hey!

663
00:59:59.013 --> 00:59:59.930
Hey.

664
01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:01.557
Let's put down the gun.

665
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.226
All right. buddy. we are
on the same side here.

666
01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:06.520
- Something came from the sky.

667
01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:08.522
There was an earthquake!

668
01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:09.982
- We know.

669
01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:11.108
- Lower.

670
01:00:11.567 --> 01:00:13.068
lower your gun.

671
01:00:13.152 --> 01:00:14.570
(Albert groaning)

672
01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:16.405
- And then the sound came.

673
01:00:19.742 --> 01:00:20.659
That sound!

674
01:00:22.578 --> 01:00:23.954
It goes inside your mind!

675
01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:27.499
- Hey. that's good. we wanna
hear your story. all right?

676
01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:29.626
We're all gonna
listen to your story.

677
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:32.171
Just put down the gun.

678
01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:34.840
- You can't hide from it.

679
01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:36.925
You can't run.

680
01:00:38.594 --> 01:00:39.511
I tried.

681
01:00:39.595 --> 01:00:40.929
I can't hear.

682
01:00:41.597 --> 01:00:42.598
Make it stop.

683
01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:43.682
- Calm it down. brother.

684
01:00:43.766 --> 01:00:46.810
All right. let's
all calm down. okay?

685
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.646
There's no more noise.
it stopped.

686
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:51.398
- You can't stop it.

687
01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.276
You can't stop this!

688
01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.569
No!

689
01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.029
No!

690
01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.864
No!

691
01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:00.574
You with them?

692
01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:02.493
Who are you?

693
01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:04.203
Who are you with? No!

694
01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:05.579
No. no. no!

695
01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.122
(gunshot booming)

696
01:01:10.084 --> 01:01:12.586
(birds chirping)

697
01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:17.925
- You just killed one
of the richest men in the world.

698
01:01:19.802 --> 01:01:21.345
- Yeah. but he wouldn't
shut the fuck up.

699
01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:24.598
(gun cranking)

700
01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.058
Let's move out.

701
01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:36.235
- He's a lot shorter
in real life. you know?

702
01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:41.073
(sinister music)

703
01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.337
- I'm tired.

704
01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:00.509
- Let's take five.

705
01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:13.897
I'm gonna scope.

706
01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:16.483
I'll be back.

707
01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:22.406
(gentle music)

708
01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:33.208
(Leo groaning)

709
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:35.627
- Where'd he go?

710
01:02:36.837 --> 01:02:40.340
- He went to go
scope the perimeter.

711
01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:48.891
(eerie music)

712
01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:50.726
Huh?

713
01:02:55.314 --> 01:02:56.523
- I didn't say anything.

714
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:00.527
- Nah.

715
01:03:01.487 --> 01:03:02.863
Thought I...

716
01:03:12.498 --> 01:03:14.166
- Why are we even here?

717
01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.169
- I...

718
01:03:18.879 --> 01:03:20.631
I don't fucking know.

719
01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:26.845
- We're all gonna die.

720
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:31.433
- Maybe.

721
01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:35.521
Maybe...

722
01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:38.524
we're all already dead.

723
01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:42.903
Ryan's dead.

724
01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:46.406
Leila just...

725
01:03:52.246 --> 01:03:55.791
And now Jordan's taking
us up the mountain like...

726
01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:00.671
Virgil led Dante out of hell.

727
01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:03.423
Maybe that's what this is.

728
01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:06.718
(Leo laughing)

729
01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:11.139
(eerie music)

730
01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:18.897
- What is wrong with you?

731
01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:34.788
(atmosphere rumbling)

732
01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:43.338
Fuck!

733
01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.842
(ominous music)

734
01:04:50.304 --> 01:04:51.305
Baby?

735
01:04:55.017 --> 01:04:55.892
- No.

736
01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:57.978
(sinister music)

737
01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:01.607
No. you're dead.

738
01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:03.358
You're fucking dead!

739
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:05.277
- Well look what we have here.

740
01:05:06.153 --> 01:05:07.446
Little fucking Leo.

741
01:05:09.281 --> 01:05:10.490
- You're not real.

742
01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:13.827
