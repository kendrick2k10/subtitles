5
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.320
- [Presenter] Final Fantasy VII.

6
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.360
- [Presenter] GoldenEye 007.

7
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.880
- We were all really

8
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.400
I think we were all
kind of at that stage

9
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.000
in our lives where we were
really hungry to do something.

10
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.400
- We were young and naive.

11
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.760
- Young and inexperienced.

12
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.280
and had no idea what
they were doing.

13
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.480
- I wanted to show people
that I could do this.

14
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.519
- It was our first game.

15
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.280
I don't think we knew
quite what we had.

16
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.960
- [Presenter] It's
a great lineup.

17
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.120
- [Presenter] The interactive
title of the year.

18
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.039
(upbeat music)

19
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.240
- It was a movie license

20
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.800
done by a small team
of inexperienced

21
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.640
developers and
somehow ended up being

22
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.880
the greatest first-person
shooter of its era.

23
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.680
- [Jimmy Fallon] This is
one of the best video games

24
00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:41.640
of all time.

25
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.920
- You couldn't ask for a
better cocktail recipe.

26
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.520
- Here's your spy playground.

27
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.400
- The guns. the
gadgets. the cars.

28
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.320
the girls. the memorable
villains. amazing exotic settings.

29
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.160
- One of the most important
video games yet made.

30
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.000
had a transformative
effect on the industry.

31
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.920
You can look at the video
game landscape today

32
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.320
and trace back its
origins in GoldenEye.

33
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.560
- GoldenEye is one of
those wonderful games

34
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.639
that almost splits the game
industry into two times.

35
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.640
There's before GoldenEye
and there's after GoldenEye.

36
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.640
- Halo. Call of Duty.
Medal of Honor. Battlefield.

37
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.800
all of that goes
back to GoldenEye.

38
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.160
First-person shooters were
really this PC elite genre.

39
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.440
3D gaming was really coming to

40
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.800
the fore for the first time.

41
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.400
The social element.
the friendship element.

42
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.400
the skill and personal
achievement. right?

43
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.800
It's one package that
sums up all the reasons

44
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.040
I play and want to make games.

45
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.920
- [Narrator] Ah. the
1990s. a time of innocence.

46
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.120
optimism. and social
cohesion. and Spice Girls.

47
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.280
There were no mobile
phones. no social media.

48
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.280
the internet was but
a whisper on the wind

49
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.320
and TV consisted
entirely of the same

50
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.640
old channels we'd
had for decades.

51
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.920
The video games industry
was still young.

52
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.040
widely considered to be
the realm of children

53
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.520
and toy makers. but
it was changing fast

54
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.480
as game makers were still
discovering what games could be.

55
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.160
Many video games have graced
our screens over the years.

56
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.840
few are played decades later.

57
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.840
even fewer change
the way we play.

58
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.440
This is the story of a
game that did just that.

59
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.320
(intense music)

60
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.320
- [Narrator] Rare was
founded in the 1980s

61
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.600
by brothers Tim
and Chris Stamper.

62
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.120
The Stamper brothers
began their journey

63
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.560
developing a series
of acclaimed titles

64
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.520
for the ZX Spectrum
and built themselves

65
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.680
quite a reputation for
innovative high quality games.

66
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.840
In 1985. their
work caught the eye

67
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.120
of Japanese gaming
giant Nintendo.

68
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.520
In fact. Nintendo loved
what they saw so much.

69
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.120
they invested in the
fledgling outfit.

70
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.160
taking a 49% shareholding
in the company.

71
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.560
This relationship would
go down as one of the most

72
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.840
fruitful collaborations
in video game history.

73
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.320
Together. they would
go on to create

74
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.360
some of the most beloved
video games of the nineties.

75
00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.839
- [James Batchelor] What's
amazing is that Rare

76
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.480
is this just. really...

77
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.640
at the time. it was this
really reclusive developer.

78
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.720
They didn't tell you anything.

79
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.240
They were very kind of secret.

80
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.240
and so secret that not
many people knew where they

81
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.840
were based.
and they were based on

82
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.440
what used to be a
farm in the Midlands.

83
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.159
- [Mick Gordon] Middle
of England. a barn.

84
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.480
groups of people that
had really not done

85
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.360
a lot of video game stuff
before. were killing it.

86
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.800
- [Grant Kirkhope]
Twycross is absolutely.

87
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.760
there's nothing in it.

88
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.640
Twycross is a village that
contains. it's got one pub.

89
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.440
It's got a private school.

90
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.760
A bit further up the road
there's Twycross zoo

91
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.680
which is quite famous.
but that is it.

92
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.560
- [Krishan Sharma] You have
this extremely talented

93
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.600
cutting edge

94
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.400
game development studio out in
the middle of nowhere. right?

95
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.280
In countryside in England.

96
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.360
- [Mick Gordon] I mean over
that period of what. six years.

97
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.040
they'd done some of the
best 2D platformers.

98
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.200
some of the best 3D platformers.

99
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.800
one of the best fighting games.

100
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.200
one of the best racing games.

101
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.040
and certainly one of the
best first-person shooters.

102
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.040
- [Grant Kirkhope] People
underestimate the influence

103
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.520
of Tim Stamper
and Chris Stamper.

104
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.480
They were just absolutely
always in complete sync.

105
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.960
There was never a
point in time where

106
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.600
those two guys didn't
agree on something.

107
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.360
There was always
absolute solidarity

108
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.159
and they knew exactly
what they wanted.

109
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.440
There was never a time you
could say. we're not sure.

110
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.640
Tim would always
know how it needs to be

111
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.400
for that to be fantastic.

112
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.920
- [James Batchelor] The whole point
of Rare was to do things differently.

113
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.600
to not just make the same games

114
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.640
that have come before.
but it works for them.

115
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.280
They're kind of
isolated a little bit

116
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.360
in that they're on this
kind of farm style campus.

117
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.560
They've got different barns.

118
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.159
so different buildings
where the different teams

119
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.720
make different games
and they are

120
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.000
just in this little Rare world.

121
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.200
- [James Miskell] You know.
when you buy a Nintendo game.

122
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.840
it would have the
Nintendo seal of quality?

123
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.920
To me. the Rare logo. back then.

124
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.600
was the Nintendo
seal of quality.

125
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.840
You knew you were
getting an amazing game.

126
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.840
- [Grant Kirkhope] You used to
always want to make the fact

127
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.440
that the Rare logo
should sell the game

128
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.920
without even knowing
about the review.

129
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.080
You see that blue R on
that game box. you buy it.

130
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.360
- They just didn't
make bad games.

131
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.440
- Rare was a very sort of
clandestine place in some respects

132
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.440
nobody ever did interviews.

133
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.440
no one knew what we were up to
until the game came out.

134
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.720
No one had any idea
because Tim and Chris

135
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.680
weren't interested in fame.

136
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.880
we just work on the games.
we focus on the games.

137
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.159
make them the best they can be.

138
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.000
we put them out and
they do the talking.

139
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.600
- [Martin Watts] Rare
was a very important

140
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.520
and iconic developer

141
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.040
back during the
nineties. you know.

142
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.640
It really pushed the boundaries.

143
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.280
not just with the N64.

144
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.760
So. they developed
Donkey Kong Country.

145
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.120
That was a game which used
pre-rendered 3D graphics.

146
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.560
And for it to be on that console

147
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.720
at that time. it looked amazing.

148
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.320
- [David Craddock] They were
able to render these gorgeous

149
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.440
3D models and then
make them 2D sprites.

150
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.880
but they maintained almost
the same level of graphical

151
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.160
fidelity as their original
source models had.

152
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.200
It just made the
Super Nintendo look

153
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.800
like it could be the
next generation console.

154
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.960
It wasn't old. It was new again.

155
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.000
- [Mick Gordon] It was evident
back in Donkey Kong Country

156
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.560
where they were using
3D development stuff

157
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.720
in a 2D environment to give
the illusion of a 3D world.

158
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.960
Nobody was doing that at all.

159
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.080
- [Peer Schneider] So
in the late nineties

160
00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:39.960
we saw a lot of innovation
around how games are played.

161
00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:43.440
how games control. how
camera systems work.

162
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.320
how progression in levels
work. all of that stuff.

163
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.200
It was kind of this
Wild West of developers

164
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.800
trying a whole bunch
of different things.

165
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.360
And then. you know. over time.

166
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.800
certain things stuck around.
certain things went away.

167
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.240
- [Graeme Mason] The PC
market was absolutely booming

168
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.480
thanks to the advent
of 3D graphics cards.

169
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.320
- [Ad Narrator] Welcome
to the world of Doom.

170
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.240
A hellish nightmare
for the more real...

171
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.360
- Because the PC was the home
of the first-person shooter.

172
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.080
- [Tommy Thompson] We didn't
call them first-person shooters.

173
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.680
We called them Doom clones

174
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.960
because everyone made games
that were kind of like Doom.

175
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.360
- [Joao Diniz Sanches]
First-person shooters.

176
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.680
let's remember at the
time. weren't a thing.

177
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.880
they weren't a genre.

178
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.400
They were just shooters
in a 3D environment.

179
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.720
- [Peer Schneider] The landscape
for first-person shooters

180
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.560
was pretty young back then.

181
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.600
It was more about monster
closets. fast paced shooting.

182
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.000
you know. skill-based gameplay.

183
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.360
but not really campaign-based

184
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.039
storytelling and puzzle solving.

185
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.200
- [Dan Ryckert] For me.
FPS was just id games.

186
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.720
It was Wolfenstein and Doom
because that's all I knew.

187
00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.440
- [Tommy Thompson] And then
moving into Quake and Unreal

188
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.720
around the same
era as one another.

189
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.720
- [Joao Diniz Sanchez]
You had kind of. you know

190
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.560
violent games beginning
to kind of become popular.

191
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.400
And so you needed the
consoles to match that.

192
00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.480
- I'd seen really rad. awesome
3D stuff in the arcades

193
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.200
playing all sorts of video games
like Virtua Cop and things.

194
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.160
But the concept of
having three-dimensional

195
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.720
first-person shooter game
at home was revolutionary.

196
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.920
- This transition from Mega
Drive and Super Nintendo

197
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.200
to the PlayStation or
even the Sega Saturn

198
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.240
adapting to these new
forms is introducing

199
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.000
all these new
challenges and problems.

200
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.880
- You'd seen some
experimentations with 3D

201
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.400
on the Super Nintendo. things
like Star Fox and F-Zero

202
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.320
and Pilotwings. and it
was sort of fake 3D.

203
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.960
It wasn't really good 3D.

204
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.000
- Most interesting is how
the different developers

205
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.840
kind of used this newfound power

206
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.360
of using the third dimension.

207
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.600
like how they would use it
to create new experiences.

208
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.280
- It's also around
this sort of time

209
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.440
that you had Tomb Raider.

210
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.960
Tomb Raider was made in Britain.
You had Grand Theft Auto.

211
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.040
Grand Theft Auto was
made in Scotland.

212
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.520
There were a lot of
very kind of ambitious

213
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.640
creative UK developers
trying to push the bounds

214
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.640
of this new 3D world and
what we could do with it.

215
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.760
and they were having
worldwide hits.

216
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.840
- [Karl Hilton] I'd been to
lots of interviews in London.

217
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.840
It was like. great. London.

218
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.520
Then I ended up in a
farmhouse in Warwickshire

219
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.120
it was quite bizarre.

220
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.960
- [Brett Jones] The
actual layout was you have

221
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.440
the big farmhouse itself

222
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.560
which was sorting out all
the minutia of the day.

223
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.880
You know. making sure
the company works

224
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.080
and all that sort of stuff.

225
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.600
And then there were
literally barns

226
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.080
where they used to
keep the horses.

227
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.040
And these had been
turned into offices

228
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.800
and each team was
in one of the barns

229
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.600
and where the horse
sort of stalls where

230
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.840
they'd been turned into
our individual offices.

231
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.200
- [Steve Ellis] They
were each big enough for

232
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.560
two or three people.

233
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.480
When I started. I
had one to myself.

234
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.920
which was right
next to the crèche.

235
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.880
So I got to hear kids
playing all day.

236
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.720
- [Brett Jones] Of course
there was no internet.

237
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.880
so it was like get on with this.

238
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.160
you're in your computer
now. get on with it.

239
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.200
But it was really nice. that
barn sort of feel to it.

240
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.400
- [David Doak] That was
very much how Rare worked.

241
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.120
It was kind of everyone
was in their little silo

242
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.880
and there was a Donkey Kong barn.

243
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.440
and there was a barn that
ended up where Banjo was.

244
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.080
There was the Killer block.
people making Killer Instinct.

245
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.880
- [Steve Ellis] I was
22 when I joined Rare.

246
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.200
I think the others were
mostly about the same

247
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.720
or a little bit older.

248
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.160
Well. I was straight out of uni.

249
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.480
so I'd never worked on an actual

250
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.560
game that had been released.

251
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.520
- [Karl Hilton] 24 and no
experience at all in making games.

252
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.080
Rare was my first job
out of the university. so.

253
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.760
- [David Doak]
I was a scientist.

254
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.040
So I was at Oxford University
and I'd done my degree and PhD

255
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.960
and I worked in molecular
structure determination.

256
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.880
- [Duncan Botwood] So I
was about 23. I guess.

257
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.400
I had not got a
degree at that point.

258
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.720
I'd dropped out of architecture.

259
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.200
- [Grant Kirkhope]
For someone like me.

260
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.280
I really genuinely thought I'd
just end up like a tramp.

261
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.120
I did the university thing.
messed around in bands

262
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.600
for years and years
to get to 33.

263
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.760
so 11 years as a long time
just living at home with my mother.

264
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.520
I don't know. I would've
just been a pub rocker

265
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.800
making 30 quid a night
probably to this day.

266
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.680
- [Graeme Norgate] So when I
joined Rare. I would have been.

267
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.760
I'd just turned 23 and all
my experience up to that point

268
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.040
was playing games and wanting
to do music for games.

269
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.120
- As well as the
artists and programmers.

270
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.560
they wanted a
system administrator

271
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.880
to go and run their
Silicon Graphics network.

272
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.720
And at the time I was running
a Silicon Graphics network

273
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.840
as part of my job in the lab.
And I'd had a bad day...

274
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.240
I kinda thought. well. yeah.
screw it. I'll apply for this.

275
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.800
- This was my first job.
It was a good job.

276
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.640
I was earning more money
than I ever had done before.

277
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.080
And I was getting to
work on James Bond.

278
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.720
- The name's Bond. James Bond.

279
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.000
- A new project had
come in from Nintendo.

280
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.520
They've got the
rights to GoldenEye.

281
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.680
(upbeat music)

282
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.200
And they'd come
to Rare and said.

283
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.880
would you lead a new team
to make this GoldenEye game?

284
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.720
- [David Craddock] The
offer for a movie game.

285
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.680
a movie tie-in game.
came up to Rare.

286
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.880
It was kind of the last
thing anyone wanted to do.

287
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.640
- They didn't really
like making adult games.

288
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.720
They wanted to make broad
appeal family games.

289
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.680
So GoldenEye was a little bit
out of the ordinary for them.

290
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.160
- Martin Hollis was
the guy who stepped up

291
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.400
and said. okay. I'll do this.
This could be kind of fun.

292
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.600
And everyone else was
like. great. cool.

293
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.240
We want to keep
making our own games.

294
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.280
- [Narrator] Martin Hollis.
a young. ambitious

295
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.440
university graduate from the
south of England

296
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.320
had only been with
Rare a short time

297
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.840
before the opportunity to
make GoldenEye came up.

298
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.680
His total experience
working in games

299
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.560
was a brief stint
working on a coin-op

300
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.320
conversion of Killer
Instinct. and that was it.

301
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.840
He was. however. a
massive Bond fan.

302
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.360
as evidenced by this homage to

303
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.440
the infamous Bond
gun barrel sequence

304
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.360
he made with his
brothers as a young lad.

305
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.640
shown here at a GDC
2012 GoldenEye talk.

306
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.240
But making a game
about Bond

307
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.120
would be a much larger challenge.

308
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.560
Hollis would have to build a
team and a game from scratch.

309
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.160
Martin's first
recruit to the team

310
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.760
was programming
prodigy. Mark Edmonds.

311
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.680
A man of few words.
Mark was in charge

312
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.280
of the core engine
and AI systems.

313
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.160
Joining him was
architecture graduate

314
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.080
turned lead artist. Karl Hilton.

315
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.640
and populating Karl's environments
with character models

316
00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.920
and animations was Brett Jones.

317
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.920
Duncan Botwood came
aboard next as a designer

318
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.400
to work on level progression
and mission structures.

319
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.320
programmer Steve Ellis
was brought in

320
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.200
to code the weapons
and explosion effects.

321
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.800
and David Doak joined to
help craft the missions.

322
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.040
storylines. and objectives.

323
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.400
But what of GoldenEye's
signature soundscape?

324
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.920
Well. that came courtesy
of Graeme Norgate

325
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.240
and Grant Kirkhope.
with the dynamic duo

326
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.680
providing the music
and sound effects.

327
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.680
And last but not
least. Adrian Smith

328
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.280
was the final piece
of the puzzle.

329
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.160
joining the team to help
with effects and UI.

330
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.360
- The level of
ambivalence in terms of

331
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.480
the studio that's
managing that project.

332
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.560
the publisher that's
funding the project.

333
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.200
the license holder who
also has a lot of say

334
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.080
in what that game
should be...

335
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.120
James Bond is one of the
biggest IPs in pop culture

336
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.000
and everyone's like.
ah. they'll make it.

337
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.240
- Yeah. Martin Hollis came
in one day. didn't know him.

338
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.760
Then Martin said. "I've been
offered you for my new team."

339
00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.640
I'm like. oh great. what is it?

340
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.400
He said. "Well. do you
like James Bond movies?"

341
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.080
And at the time I was
thinking. you know.

342
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.320
I love James Bond movies.

343
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.520
I'm thinking. but video game
James Bond movies?

344
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.360
- [Simon Parkin] In the late
nineties. every major film

345
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.240
that came along had to have a
licensed video game attached.

346
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.960
And this was not because
Hollywood. you know.

347
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.120
particularly valued or respected
the video game industry.

348
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.400
It was like. this is a
really useful marketing tool.

349
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.440
- Nobody believed that a
GoldenEye game would work.

350
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:30.280
Licensed tie-in games at
the time were like a toy.

351
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.360
You know. you had
the baseball cap.

352
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.680
you had the lunchbox. and
you had the video game.

353
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.320
- [Peer Schneider] Movie
license games often failed

354
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.120
because the game play
wasn't good. Right?

355
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.240
They were cranked out
to just kind of hit

356
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.360
a deadline and kind of resemble

357
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.480
the franchises that
were so popular.

358
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.200
- We all got Bond.

359
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.600
There wasn't some style
sheet that we needed to read.

360
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.880
- We were James Bond fans.

361
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.960
We all wanted to be James
Bond. That was the whole point.

362
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.640
- And I was able to
rattle off a load

363
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.120
of kind of Bond ideas because
I'd read all the books

364
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.600
and obviously seen all
the films and so on.

365
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.480
So I wouldn't stop talking
for about half an hour

366
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.800
about all the things
we could do with it.

367
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.320
- I was a big Bond fan. So
I watched all the Bonds.

368
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.480
- When the movies came out.

369
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.360
they were the biggest
movie of the year. always.

370
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.600
The best effects.
the best music.

371
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.360
everything was
spectacular in Bond films.

372
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.480
So you always knew

373
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.200
you're in for a great ride
on a Bond movie.

374
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.240
In the first few days.

375
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.920
I do remember sitting
down and talking about

376
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.240
what kind of a
game it should be.

377
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.200
I used to love playing
Spy Hunter in the arcades.

378
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.040
Maybe it's a sort of
Spy Hunter. sort of.

379
00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.360
top-down driving game.

380
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.960
- [Graeme Mason] They wanted to do
something for the Super Nintendo.

381
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.600
the SNES. I assume
it would have been vastly

382
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.400
different given the different
powers of the two machines.

383
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.120
probably a 2D platformer.

384
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.320
- Everyone was working on
Super Nintendo at the time.

385
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.840
And Martin had said
to them. I will do it.

386
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.680
but he wanted to work
on the new console

387
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.720
that was coming along.

388
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.960
- Martin had the
vision. you know.

389
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.680
he was the only guy that had
actually done a game before.

390
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.640
So he was the one powering
through this and saying.

391
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.040
you know. I think
we'd like to do this.

392
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.240
I think we'd like to do that.

393
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.000
- Especially in
those early phases.

394
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.520
it's Mark Edmonds
and Martin Hollis.

395
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.040
But Mark was the engineer.

396
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.480
Mark essentially
built the core engine

397
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.160
and an awful lot of
the subsequent tools

398
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.319
that were available to
the rest of the team

399
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.319
to start building
all the level designs

400
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.400
and create all these really
fun. unique experiences.

401
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.720
- Of course you
have to remember.

402
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.200
first-person shooters got off
to a much slower start on consoles.

403
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.960
Yes. there were ports of
games like Wolfenstein 3D

404
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.319
and Doom on earlier systems
like the Super Nintendo.

405
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.800
and the 32X. but technically
they were really ugly

406
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.360
and kind of just stumbled
compared to the PC counterparts.

407
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.480
- At the time. people are like.

408
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.640
a shooter won't work on
consoles because you need a PC.

409
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.800
You need mouse control
because it's more accurate

410
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.320
or you need a keyboard
because you've

411
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.440
got so many different buttons.
so many different options.

412
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.160
- They were much better
suited. that sort of game.

413
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.120
to the PC because you
can use the mouse to aim.

414
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.840
You can use the keyboard
to move your character.

415
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.400
You can map different
keys to different actions.

416
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.120
On a video game
console controller.

417
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.920
you're much more limited
in what you can do.

418
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.320
- At some point. details
about the Ultra 64.

419
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.000
They were boasting about
all this new power

420
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.560
that this console would have.

421
00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.720
And at some point
Martin got a brain storm

422
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.320
and decided that actually

423
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.960
this sort of game
would work in 3D.

424
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.600
- We all knew it was
coming. No one had seen it.

425
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.280
No one knew much
about it but we knew

426
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.040
it was going to be a 3D console.

427
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.080
- With the early
through mid-nineties.

428
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.200
you're going through this
massive technological upheaval.

429
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.480
like consoles are
adapting and being built

430
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.200
and being released
like really frequently

431
00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.120
and really quickly. the
hardware is changing.

432
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.360
and in turn the software
that we have to build

433
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.920
for it is changing as well.

434
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.680
At this transition
from 2D into 3D gaming.

435
00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.400
we don't really know
what's the standard

436
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.040
by which we're going
to build 3D games.

437
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.760
- Because the 3D
thing was a new thing.

438
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.080
there wasn't a body of
people with those experiences

439
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.480
or those skills.
so you're almost

440
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.320
kind of taking a punt on people.

441
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.440
So like Karl. for instance.
Karl Hilton

442
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.520
was an architecture
graduate. you know.

443
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.000
and. yeah. he'd done a
bit of messing around

444
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.720
doing 3D modeling. but not much.

445
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.560
- The developers are...

446
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.600
relatively new
to this experience.

447
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.600
Many of them had never
shipped a game before

448
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.480
and given a tremendous
amount of freedom

449
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.400
to experiment and
play around with ideas

450
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.800
and throwing things in ad hoc
to see whether it sticks.

451
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.640
- And then we also were
talking about different

452
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.680
shooters. particularly
the Virtua Cop games.

453
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.960
- Originally it was supposed
to be an on-rails game.

454
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.480
The feel of that
is quite different.

455
00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.760
- So you would go through
each level at the same pace.

456
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.960
kind of almost Star Fox
style or Time Crisis.

457
00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.760
that sort of thing. and it
would be the same each time.

458
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.760
And you just have to kind of
improve your score each time.

459
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.960
- You didn't have
control over movement.

460
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.360
but you could aim
just in some of

461
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.760
the classic kind of
arcade on-rails shooters.

462
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.880
- And they put everything in
to make it play like Virtua Cop.

463
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.880
and then everyone was
playing it and going

464
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.640
it's not any fun.

465
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.000
It looks like Virtua Cop.
it moves like Virtua Cop.

466
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.680
it's got the Bond.
but it's not fun.

467
00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.600
- GoldenEye was
one of those games that

468
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.040
kept on getting
delayed and obviously

469
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.440
missed the release of the movie.

470
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.080
and even the home video release.

471
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.360
- It has the markings of
like a small indie outfit now

472
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.400
who's got far more
resource and budget

473
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.360
than anyone would
potentially imagine

474
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.120
with no constraint on.

475
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.200
right. you've got to ship
this in six months.

476
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.800
It's. we'll keep paying the bills.

477
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.800
but could you try
and ship something?

478
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.560
- Nintendo is not like many
other video game companies

479
00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.160
in that. you know.
it was able to say

480
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.800
it cares most. first and
foremost about the quality

481
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.040
of the games that
appear on its hardware.

482
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.640
So it's less about we need
to hit this release date

483
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.960
so that we maximize
our profits

484
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.040
because we're tying in with
the film's release.

485
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.920
It's more like. no.
we're gonna wait on this

486
00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.520
until it's right. until
it's ready. until it's good.

487
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.800
- Now there was concerns that
it wasn't a very Nintendo-ish

488
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.800
product. it was quite.
we got told

489
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.080
repeatedly it was too
dark and it was violent.

490
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.800
To which our response was. well.

491
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.680
it's dark because the
film's dark and it's violent

492
00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.440
because it's James Bond
and he kills people.

493
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.200
- There's a very
well-known story now

494
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.760
that Martin Hollis tells about

495
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.480
late into the game's
development receiving a fax

496
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.480
from Shigeru Miyamoto.
who is still the most

497
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.040
famous video game
designer in the world.

498
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.840
And certainly was at that time.

499
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.640
Sort of giving us
feedback on GoldenEye.

500
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.480
and he says he doesn't
like the violence.

501
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.960
He says it sort of feels tragic.

502
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.640
and is there no way that
at the end of the game.

503
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.640
you as Agent 007 can
visit the hospital ward

504
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.560
where all of the people
that you've taken down

505
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.720
during the course of the
game are sort of holed up

506
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.200
and can you not
work your way down

507
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.760
the beds shaking
everyone's hands?

508
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.440
It's obviously a very funny
story. but it also illustrates.

509
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.120
I think. something
about Nintendo

510
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.160
and Miyamoto's approach
to video game design.

511
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.280
and probably their
nervousness about a game

512
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.800
like GoldenEye appearing
on their flagship hardware.

513
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.360
At one point they were
even saying. well.

514
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.520
we're not sure about this.
Maybe we just cancel it.

515
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.680
And because they'd
rather lose that money

516
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.520
and preserve their reputation
as a fantastic

517
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.560
video game publisher
than they would to

518
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.680
recoup some of that money

519
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.840
and put something else
out that's substandard.

520
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.640
- [Narrator] So let's do
a quick summary. Shall we?

521
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.560
We have an inexperienced
ragtag group

522
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.720
of university graduates
working in a barn

523
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.480
somewhere in the
English countryside

524
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.360
on a game
based off a movie.

525
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.120
a game about a spy
with a license to kill.

526
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.720
to be played on a console
that didn't exist yet

527
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.960
for the company that brought you

528
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.880
Princess Peach and
Zelda. Get all that?

529
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.200
- It's the N64! Oh my God!

530
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.360
- This holiday season.
it's the new Nintendo 64.

531
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.640
So what's the big deal.

532
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.880
and why is Toys "R"
Us already sold out?

533
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.520
- [David Doak] When we all
got our production N64s

534
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.920
and everyone had Mario.
and Pilotwings and stuff.

535
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.640
but particularly Mario.

536
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.280
literally people were
sitting in offices

537
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.800
watching other
people play Mario.

538
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.040
and everyone was going...

539
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.960
You know. jaw drop.

540
00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.880
From the moment you
pick up that game.

541
00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.480
it just says. go. explore.

542
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.400
- It was symbolic of
the time that. you know.

543
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.560
you had this new level
of freedom. you know.

544
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.320
afforded by games like
GoldenEye 007.

545
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.680
and Super Mario 64. and
Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

546
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.280
You know. there was.
I think. an emphasis

547
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.120
from a gameplay
perspective to get

548
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.880
the players to go
off and explore.

549
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.080
I remember the first time
seeing Super Mario 64.

550
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.040
and it was really the first
time I'd seen a 3D game

551
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.200
and it was like the
world had changed.

552
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.920
And we're right on
this tipping era

553
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.280
that we'll never see
again in the same way

554
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.440
of moving from two dimensions
to three dimensions.

555
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.720
which was such a
tremendous shift

556
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.640
in the way that not only games
would be made.

557
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.600
but also thought
about. but also played.

558
00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.440
- That just blew people's minds.

559
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.000
You can wander around doing stuff
that you'd never been able

560
00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.600
to do before. exploring
the game in a way

561
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.000
that you'd never been able to.

562
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.800
- I had that curiosity.
I was just like.

563
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.320
oh. what's that over there?

564
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.040
N64 games and
GoldenEye specifically.

565
00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.040
which led me to be the
games tester that I am now.

566
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.600
You know. that curiosity.
I was just like.

567
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.320
let's zoom into that
with a sniper rifle.

568
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.680
There's a thing over there.
How do we get over there?

569
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.160
Don't know. we'll find out.

570
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.960
And then you go to Facility
and you poke around

571
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.520
all the corners and
you see some flasks

572
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.880
and a vent and you're like.
who put flasks up there?

573
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.240
- It just had this go
anywhere. do anything.

574
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.040
kind of flavor to it even though

575
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.760
it's not really an
open world game.

576
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.920
A lot of the levels
kind of feel like you

577
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.680
can kind of go
everywhere. go anywhere.

578
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.680
and just play around with it.

579
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.680
And so it was just
such an open feeling.

580
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.720
- Before GoldenEye. most
first-person shooters

581
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.160
operated with the
Doom clone mentality.

582
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.240
Shoot everything that
moves. collect the keys.

583
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.160
go through the doors. find
the exit. rinse and repeat.

584
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.480
GoldenEye. depending on the
difficulty you selected.

585
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.160
would give you
different objectives.

586
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.760
It's not just A to B.

587
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.640
Some of them are A
to B. but it's A to B

588
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.760
via objectives C. D. and E.

589
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.960
Here's a level.
this is what you need

590
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.440
to do in the level
before you leave.

591
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.640
- Doom had it to a point
and Quake had it to a point

592
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.080
where there's keycards. right?

593
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.960
Blue. the gold. the red. but
it was kind of rudimentary.

594
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.120
'cause it was early
nineties gaming. you know?

595
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.480
GoldenEye come out.
and it was just like.

596
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.160
no. we have to talk to
this character over here.

597
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.080
That's never happened to
me before in a video game.

598
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.360
in terms of FPS. I have
to then look at my watch

599
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.920
to get something.
throw it at a thing.

600
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.960
it was doing so many things
new and fresh at the time.

601
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.400
but looking back like
it completely rewrote

602
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.080
the rules for video games.
FPS and otherwise.

603
00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.080
(intense music)

604
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.280
- It wasn't until.
I would say. 1997.

605
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.320
kind of the year that
first-person shooters

606
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.120
exploded on the Nintendo 64.

607
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.120
when you had this perfect
union of a controller

608
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.240
that was up to the
job of playing FPS

609
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.920
and hardware that was
up to the job of running

610
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.440
and displaying
FPS that the genre

611
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.800
really took off on consoles.

612
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.760
- Within the year of
GoldenEye coming out in 1997.

613
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.440
there was Doom 64. which
isn't a port of Doom.

614
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.120
it's a completely
separate Doom game

615
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.280
that was made with id
Software's blessing.

616
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.360
Hexen 64. which is a
direct port of the game.

617
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.480
but also. Turok:
Dinosaur Hunter.

618
00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.160
- It was very impressive
from a lot of standpoints.

619
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.080
very complex worlds were built.

620
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.880
The characters were
not sprites anymore.

621
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.960
They were fully 3D again

622
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.200
and had pretty intricate
animations.

623
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.800
- When you see something like that
and you look at your own work.

624
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.160
and all you can see are the
things that are wrong with it.

625
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.640
You know. you're
thinking. oh God.

626
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.960
we're miles behind on this.

627
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.480
I remember being really worried
because it had very nice

628
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.600
looking art and it
ran really smoothly.

629
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.320
It had really good frame rate
because they had the fog

630
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.920
a lot of the time
and these dinosaurs

631
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.800
would run out of the fog at you
at a really nice frame rate.

632
00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.520
You'd be like. oh. that's nice.

633
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.720
We did look at
that and think. oh.

634
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.360
do we need to go back
and try and get the game

635
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.640
to run faster. is there
anything else I can do?

636
00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.200
Should we be turning off the
Z buffer and things like that?

637
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.720
Yeah. it was a real
benchmark for us.

638
00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.920
- [Duncan Botwood] So I started
building the dam

639
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.800
without any real
technical knowledge

640
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.960
and I was playing around with
the size of it and we realized

641
00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.120
we could take the movies
as a source for sure.

642
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.560
And we also look at the set
models and the set diagrams

643
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.480
that they'd drawn out.
that they built.

644
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.720
- And he just built the dam

645
00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.040
and then we put it in
and it's like. woah!

646
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.000
- We ended up with this real
sprawling mass of a level

647
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.840
that was running at an
abysmally low frame rate.

648
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.160
- So then that's why you have
the tunnels leading up to it.

649
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.640
was to try and cut as much
of the views off as possible.

650
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.800
You know. and then I went
through and basically hacked

651
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.800
as many polys out as I could.

652
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.080
There'd be a big thing

653
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.520
that Martin put up
which would show you

654
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.720
the frame rate
you currently had.

655
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.760
So I could spin around and
look at what he was doing.

656
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.080
And then suddenly the framerate
would drop horrendously.

657
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.520
It's like. right.
what's over there?

658
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.320
Okay. Go in. hack around.

659
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.720
- [Duncan Botwood] That was
a kind of awakening for me.

660
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.120
Like. oh yeah. it's got
to run. Oh. okay.

661
00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.280
- The engine was great
because I could sit there

662
00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.760
on my machine
and play with stuff

663
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.200
and then immediately
make the level.

664
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.040
put it in the game. and
then try it out again.

665
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.560
So I could just
go through this process

666
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.120
of just hacking away at this.

667
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.040
So you start off with
levels that look fantastic.

668
00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.760
And by the time I'd
finished with them.

669
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.960
they were sort of a bare bones.

670
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.440
- And we got to go
to Leavesden Studios.

671
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.920
where they were
filming GoldenEye.

672
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.800
And we had a day's visit there.

673
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.080
And because I had
this very rare thing

674
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.520
called the digital
camera at the time.

675
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.400
which was this massive.
massive. heavy camera.

676
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.680
My job was to go round
and film and. you know.

677
00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.600
try and get reference
for everything.

678
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.120
And we saw St. Petersburg
where they had the tank chase

679
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.160
and that was all still up.

680
00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.280
And then inside one of the
actual studios was the huge.

681
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.240
you know. the villain's
lair set at the end.

682
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.240
And we saw that while it was
in its pristine condition.

683
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.440
Then we went back
the second time

684
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.920
we saw it in its
blown up condition.

685
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.560
- Martin was very
pragmatic about stuff.

686
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.120
It's like. you go off and
make what you want to make.

687
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.800
And then we'll look
at it and work out

688
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.040
how we're going
to get it to work.

689
00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.600
It was all very.
very co-operative.

690
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.120
It was never like.
this is what you do.

691
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.440
This is how you do it.
Don't break these rules.

692
00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.200
It was much more. what
kind of things do you need?

693
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.680
- [David Doak] A good
example is the frigate.

694
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.720
That's in it because in the film

695
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.760
there's a helicopter is
on a frigate in Monaco.

696
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.880
So Karl had built the frigate
and we had

697
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.280
a helicopter model
and that was it.

698
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.840
So it was like. well. okay.

699
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.840
so what are you going
to do in that level?

700
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.640
Maybe you're trying
to rescue hostages.

701
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.400
Well. that sounds
like it might work.

702
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.520
Okay. Well. let's
roll with that.

703
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.480
- Someone would come back
in and go actually. Mark.

704
00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.280
what would also be
great. can we do this?

705
00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.800
Can we have them like dodge roll

706
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.160
or hide behind
cover. like. okay.

707
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.080
That's not in there now. and
then a couple of days later.

708
00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.600
boom. it appears in the source.

709
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.520
- [Adrian Smith] I was then
doing a lot of the gun modeling.

710
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.640
So I was working in
conjunction with Mark Edmonds.

711
00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.800
not only to get
the front end in.

712
00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.800
'cause I had to
model all the hands.

713
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.440
It was myself and Mark
that came up with the HUD.

714
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.000
and I should have
trademarked that

715
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.360
because the HUD was
pretty much then the go-to

716
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.160
front end for any
of the consoles.

717
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.120
- It was always. what can
we do? What can we create?

718
00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.320
What sort of things can
we do? How do we do it?

719
00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.880
- Creates this kind of
crazy cycle of iteration.

720
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.600
everything that Mark
Edmonds was doing

721
00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.040
and building. that code base.

722
00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.200
but also allowing the
designers that kind of level

723
00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.920
of flexibility to just
create whatever they wanted.

724
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.200
He was working really
hard in this whole backend

725
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.480
that was reduced
into byte code

726
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.400
that was really performant
and ran super quick

727
00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.240
on what was ultimately very
limited hardware on the N64.

728
00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.120
- [Narrator] Under the
watchful eye of the Stampers.

729
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.480
the team would work
long days and weekends

730
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.160
polishing and refining the
gameplay levels and difficulty.

731
00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.880
They would even bring in elements
of the extended James Bond

732
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.600
universe to create a game
overflowing with content

733
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.240
and creativity. but
would it pay off?

734
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.160
(upbeat music)

735
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.400
- [Grant Kirkhope] These days.
you can load up a synth patch

736
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.960
put your finger on a
keyboard and it's this

737
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.240
huge. great. swathe of sound
that's just incredible.

738
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.440
It's just amazing. but
we couldn't do that then.

739
00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.160
Most of the sounds in
GoldenEye are probably

740
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.520
16 or 11 kilohertz. right
down at the bottom end.

741
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.360
Like bass drums. you
put them in at eight. you know.

742
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.080
So. you know. it's a quarter

743
00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.800
of the quality that
you would get on a CD.

744
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.440
- The gas plant music
is a particular one.

745
00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.360
You know. that opening
kind of. "doo. doo".

746
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.760
When I hear that. I still get
a bit goosepimply about it.

747
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.920
The music and the soundscape
and the pacing itself

748
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.320
it's like. now you're Bond.

749
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.760
- It's what I love. I think.
is it sounds like a score.

750
00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.680
Every song feels like it's come

751
00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.080
from the same soundtrack.
It feels cohesive.

752
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.200
And that's very difficult to do.

753
00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.080
Their ability to carve a theme

754
00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.040
and create an emotion

755
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.680
and a feeling that
instantly linked you

756
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.800
to whatever your goal was.
whatever your mission was.

757
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.240
but also whatever
the environment was.

758
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.080
whether it's a
snowy sort of area

759
00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.360
or a sneaky area
through a facility.

760
00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.200
- GoldenEye. I think.
is an excellent example

761
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.200
of having a believable
world that you can explore

762
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.480
and you add kind of. you know.

763
00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.720
atmospheric music and then
you've got action. et cetera.

764
00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.800
You begin to build the
sense of a narrative-led

765
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.240
first-person
shooting experience.

766
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.800
which obviously we have.
you know. everywhere now.

767
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.040
- Their ability to
use nothing more

768
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.680
than a limited sound palette
and a series of notes

769
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.880
is what makes that
a great score.

770
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.920
A lot of thought had
gone into creating.

771
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.200
again. a believable
aural landscape.

772
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.320
- With Graeme Norgate
doing the sound design.

773
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.400
the gun sounds in
that game are really.

774
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.520
really good for their time.

775
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.560
That soundscape was crafted with

776
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.240
just absolute love and respect.

777
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.120
- [Graeme Norgate] It's a
luxury of being in-house.

778
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.480
We could play the game.
so you'd load up Servenya.

779
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.200
walk through it. play it. and
you'd get the idea for it.

780
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.400
And you could write something
and have that playing

781
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.880
whilst you're playing
the level again.

782
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.640
and. you know. iterate.

783
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.720
- That's another person
who is a talented person

784
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.200
at the height of their skills.

785
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.440
trying to do
something really well.

786
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.560
And then it all came together.

787
00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.400
- [Steve Ellis] When
I joined the project

788
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.760
they weren't any effects really.

789
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.880
so I think the first thing that
I worked on was explosions.

790
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.800
- Everything explodes.
It's ridiculous.

791
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.639
- Yeah. everything did
explode if you shot it

792
00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:23.199
long enough. I think.
pretty much.

793
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.360
- But it's part of the world.

794
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.280
It's like you're in this
world and there's this

795
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.320
kind of brittle
consequence for things

796
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.480
and this escalating calamity
if you do something wrong

797
00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.080
and this explodes.
this explodes.

798
00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:34.679
then this scientist
gets blown across the room.

799
00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.159
- [Steve Ellis] Yeah. I
spent ages working on that.

800
00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.800
I think it was more than
a month on the explosions.

801
00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.760
Effects are always one
of the most expensive things.

802
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.000
They can have quite a large
impact on the frame rate

803
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.600
of the game. the responsiveness.

804
00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:48.800
- That sense of immersion
and impact on the game world

805
00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.440
is another thing
that's going to keep

806
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.440
bringing players
back to keep playing

807
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.520
because it's a space
that they can control

808
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.240
in more of a way than they
could with things like Doom.

809
00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.240
- It's not in Doom. there's
not that collateral damage.

810
00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.520
And the idea that the environment
is mutable in some way.

811
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.040
It was something that was
really important to us.

812
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.720
- [Duncan Botwood]
The job I was not expecting

813
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.800
when I answered an advertisement
for a game designer

814
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.840
and document writer was to
be stuffed into a sweaty

815
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.160
neoprene suit and asked
to fall over. But...

816
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.480
(rhythmic grunting noises)

817
00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.040
(screaming)

818
00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.960
One day. I was asked to put
on a sweaty neoprene suit

819
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.000
that'd been used for Killer
Instinct and to fall over a lot.

820
00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.480
- [Brett Jones] I would
have Mr. Botwood there.

821
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.160
all covered in the markers.

822
00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.160
and then depending on how he was

823
00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.960
going to get killed
at that point.

824
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.400
he would either have
a rope around him

825
00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.480
and I'd yank him or
he would get pushed

826
00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.480
or he would get
kicked in the knee.

827
00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.440
You know when you see those guys.
they get shot in the shoulder

828
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.480
and you see them do that?

829
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.480
That's me literally going
like that and pushing him

830
00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.560
on the shoulder until he moves

831
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.280
because you can't
anticipate because

832
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.960
otherwise there's
that (deep breath).

833
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.520
He was battered. he
was really battered.

834
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.480
(laughing)

835
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.920
(rhythmic grunting noises)

836
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.880
- [Steve Ellis] I remember one
time Tim Stamper got the team

837
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.000
into a conference room
and explained to them

838
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.200
that it's not a university
project and it does

839
00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.120
need to be finished
at some point.

840
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.840
- [Graeme Norgate] Regardless
of the game being late

841
00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.120
and missing deadline
after deadline. you know.

842
00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.320
it wasn't because we
were putting our feet up.

843
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.960
- I believe they were
all in their late twenties

844
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.120
or early thirties.
Most of them were single.

845
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.120
They could work 100 hour weeks.

846
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.840
You know. whether
we think that's good

847
00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.200
or not with hindsight.
that was something

848
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.280
that they wanted to
do and did willingly.

849
00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.400
And we were the
beneficiaries of that toil.

850
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.720
- It was like a
company culture of.

851
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.160
you don't just go home at
five o'clock. that's for sure.

852
00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.560
- We used to work late at Rare.

853
00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.760
We used to like being there.

854
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.040
- Right from the start. we'd
be there till midnight

855
00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.440
and working weekends and stuff.

856
00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.360
- You didn't have to stay.

857
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.160
but it was kind of
assumed that you would.

858
00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.560
So most of the time we did.

859
00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.480
- [David Doak] We thought
the game was going to be

860
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.680
really bad.

861
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.400
So that was always the thing.

862
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.320
It's like. A. there's
not enough variety.

863
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:19.040
It's going to be boring. It's
just running and shooting.

864
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.480
And also we're not going to
get all the levels finished.

865
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.760
- It was hugely late. and it
was massively full of bugs.

866
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.120
There was just so many
things wrong with it

867
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.160
that it sort of became that game

868
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.560
that we all thought would never
actually come out in the end.

869
00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.000
- Hi. I'm Ken Lobb.

870
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.760
I'm here to tell you about
the Nintendo 64 hardware.

871
00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.960
- [Karl Hilton] Ken Lobb
was a big fan of the game.

872
00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.400
I mean. we had a lot of support.
particularly from America.

873
00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.920
- And here we have
the controller ports.

874
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.320
I'd like you to notice that
we have one. two. three. four.

875
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.920
- [Peer Schnieder]
Nintendo 64 shipped with

876
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.280
four controller ports. right?

877
00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.360
And Mario Kart 64 obviously
demonstrated to the world

878
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.760
how to properly use
those four ports.

879
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.200
- You know. from
the very offset.

880
00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.680
the machine comes
with four players.

881
00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.520
Now you still have to buy
two other controllers.

882
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.960
but not if your mates bring
them around with them. right?

883
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.320
So as a developer. you're
then beginning to think.

884
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.800
let's try and use it. perhaps
there is something in here.

885
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.800
- That was a big departure
from having to configure

886
00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.600
your LAN and having multiple
copies of every game

887
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.000
and playing across all
these different monitors.

888
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.360
- [Steve Ellis] I'm gonna say
roundabout April or May. '97.

889
00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:22.400
we started work on it.
Seems insanely close.

890
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.480
- [Duncan Botwood] In the
meantime. Nintendo of America

891
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.120
are going. you are
finishing the game. right?

892
00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.000
You're not trying to put multiplayer
in or anything are you?

893
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.240
No. no. no we're not. No.

894
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.920
It's fine. Yeah. we're
finishing the game.

895
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
- [David Doak] There was no
way Martin going to be able

896
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.120
to go to management
and say. you know what?

897
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.680
We'd really like to
put multiplayer in.

898
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.440
'Cause just like no. you're
failing to do the thing

899
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.440
you're supposed to be doing.

900
00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.320
don't be asking for more time.

901
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.080
I just remember the day
we showed it to Ken

902
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.320
because Ken would come
over every kind of.

903
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.440
couple of months.
something. to Rare.

904
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.840
I remember him coming
over and we'd set up.

905
00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.800
It was in the office where
Steve and Duncan were

906
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.320
we had TV and we had with
the four controllers sitting.

907
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.960
So that was the thing.
So he came in.

908
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.360
I just remember.
walked in with Ken.

909
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.720
Ken. we've got something
to show you.

910
00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.840
And he's like. wow!

911
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.320
Ken was always...
He used to say.

912
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.480
Oh my God. you guys!
It's like. yeah. it works.

913
00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.800
- And he was so
excited by it

914
00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.280
that he wanted to be the
one who revealed it

915
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.640
to the testers at Nintendo.

916
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.600
- So Treehouse is NoA's.
Nintendo of America's.

917
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.920
testing and kind of like
game evaluation department.

918
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.200
which Ken Lobb was
heavily involved in.

919
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.120
and we started to get
feedback from them.

920
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.840
which was. you know.
people are coming in

921
00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.080
and playing at the weekend.

922
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.680
It's like. you know.
everyone wants

923
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.000
to be testing your game.
all that kind of stuff.

924
00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.040
Going to E3 was kind of
seen as a break for us

925
00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.600
because we were close
to gold

926
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.800
and there was a big testing push
while we were there.

927
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.320
- When we were at E3.
we had the smallest stand

928
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.360
because nobody
really knew what we were doing.

929
00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.760
but it was played all the time.

930
00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.680
- [Karl Hilton] We had a
playable version on the floor

931
00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.560
and the booths were
absolutely rammed.

932
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.040
I remember watching
everyone playing it

933
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.320
and just really enjoying it.

934
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.760
So you thought. okay.
well this is good.

935
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.480
- But it was being
played all the time.

936
00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.600
The entire time. you
know. you were there.

937
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.920
you could just see
people playing GoldenEye.

938
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:14.080
It was busy. really busy
the whole time.

939
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.000
- [Narrator] Bolstered
by the positive feedback

940
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.200
from E3 and testing.
the team

941
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.000
head into the final stretch
with their spirits high.

942
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.480
All their hard work
and dedication

943
00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.720
appeared to be paying off.

944
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.720
but just as the game
was about to be shipped.

945
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.440
an order came through
from mission headquarters.

946
00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.720
- Yes. I made Timothy Dalton.
Roger Moore. and Sean Connery.

947
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.720
And I made them all particularly

948
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.160
because I gave them all
different types of jackets.

949
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.880
So one of them
had a white one on.

950
00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.160
one had a little red carnation.

951
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.720
One of them had the
double breasted suit.

952
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.480
So yeah. I have
pictures of them all

953
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.000
because I definitely made them.

954
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.560
- Got a fax I think it was
in those days.

955
00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.640
saying you can't have
the other Bonds in it.

956
00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:50.680
We don't have the rights.

957
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.440
- There is one cartridge
with all four Bonds in.

958
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.280
And I think I know who
has it at the moment.

959
00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.680
but we had to take them out
because Sean Connery

960
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.680
wouldn't let us
use his likeness.

961
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.600
- [Narrator] In a somewhat
ceremonial goodbye.

962
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.280
the team played one
final death match.

963
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.160
Doak. Hollis.
Edmonds. and Hilton

964
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.080
took part in a three-hour
marathon session

965
00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.680
to decide who was the
ultimate James Bond.

966
00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.640
- So we thought. well. we
need to have a final game.

967
00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.720
So we all sat around one
evening and played it.

968
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.720
and yeah. I can't
remember who won.

969
00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.880
It wouldn't have been me.

970
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.840
but I usually played Roger
Moore 'cause he was my favorite.

971
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.080
- [David Doak] When
we were making it.

972
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.400
we were just trying
to get it finished.

973
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.600
That was an overarching memory

974
00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.760
of particularly the
last year was just.

975
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.680
can we just please
get it finished?

976
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.760
Because it's just
taking forever.

977
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:48.040
- You get to the end of
the game and you are blind

978
00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.560
to what's good about it
and all you can see

979
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.120
is all the things that
were on your wishlist

980
00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.160
that you haven't
had the time to do.

981
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.480
So you kind of only
see its flaws.

982
00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.120
- You see all the things
that are wrong with it.

983
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.720
We knew the frame rate
was awful in places.

984
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.360
there were loads
of art that I did

985
00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.880
that we didn't manage to get in.

986
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.080
There were game ideas
that we didn't get in.

987
00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.840
It was late and we knew the
film had long since gone.

988
00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.560
So. you know. whether
anyone was going

989
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.560
to be remotely interested
in it when it came out.

990
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.840
I had no idea at all.

991
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.920
- [Narrator] After working
some utterly back-breaking hours.

992
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.160
the game was finally
deemed finished

993
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.920
and sent to the distributors.

994
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.600
GoldenEye 007 released on
the 25th of August. 1997.

995
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.320
- [Simon Parkin] GoldenEye
was not a smash hit on day one

996
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.400
like in the way that the
really big games are today.

997
00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.920
- [Radio voice] GoldenEye 007 not
only defined a generation.

998
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.160
but defied all expectation.

999
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.960
- [Brett Jones] It
was more word of mouth

1000
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.800
and sort of a snowball effect.

1001
00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.640
- [Martin Watts] When it did
finally release and everyone

1002
00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.440
started playing it and people
start playing the multiplayer.

1003
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.720
there was a real buzz around it.

1004
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.440
People were talking
about. you know.

1005
00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.360
people talking about it at
the playground. at work.

1006
00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.880
- You like shoot
people in the head

1007
00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.240
when they're having a shit in
the toilet in the air vent.

1008
00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.920
and I'm just like. this
sounds interesting.

1009
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.920
- Shooting that dude
who was on the toilet

1010
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.520
and just being like.
oh. you poor bastard.

1011
00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.640
I felt so bad for him.

1012
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.000
- Straight away you were
there. You were James Bond.

1013
00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.800
You were playing
James Bond. and that was it.

1014
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.080
- Definitely the first time
just sticking the cartridge in.

1015
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:23.920
turning it on. and it
was that audio cue. Shoo!

1016
00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.360
And then you knew
your life was different.

1017
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.640
- When I got that
cartridge finally at home.

1018
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.440
literally I played
throughout the night.

1019
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.400
- My friend and I rented it
like that first weekend

1020
00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.880
it was out and it
was just all we did.

1021
00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.920
- I just spent the whole
weekend playing GoldenEye.

1022
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.640
- There was only one
copy of GoldenEye

1023
00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.680
left in the Toys "R" Us
shelves in Chatswood.

1024
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.560
and I remember I
bought the game first

1025
00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.840
because I didn't want anyone
else to have that game.

1026
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.320
- There'd be four of us playing.

1027
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.440
There would be four behind
the couch waiting to play.

1028
00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.560
There would be three more making
sandwiches in the kitchen.

1029
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.920
There'd be another two
turning up after school.

1030
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.640
That's what we did.
we played GoldenEye

1031
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.560
for two years straight.

1032
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.200
- Here is your spy playground.

1033
00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.760
- You felt like
you were somewhere

1034
00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.880
and you were actually
going towards something.

1035
00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.440
and. you know. working towards

1036
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.880
a proper goal in a real place.

1037
00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.560
- I remember the
sense of wonder.

1038
00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.840
Just walking through
the dam for the first time

1039
00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.920
and sort of feeling
the big open spaces

1040
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.520
that actually felt
like big open spaces.

1041
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.880
- That's the freedom that
keeps you coming back.

1042
00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.680
- So glad they had
the vision to go.

1043
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.960
what if we just took
James Bond off the rails

1044
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.640
and give the player the ability

1045
00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.360
to run around and
do what they want?

1046
00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.960
- You know. running
into this gate

1047
00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.120
and going like. where do I
go. pulling out your gun.

1048
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.520
shooting the lock. it just
blew our minds at the time.

1049
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.160
- If you played it
like you played Doom.

1050
00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.560
you'd fail the mission.

1051
00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.880
You had to use your brain.

1052
00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.600
and I think that's
what helped it spread.

1053
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.360
- It was the game
everyone wanted to play.

1054
00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.240
Growing up as a
PlayStation player.

1055
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.080
and my friends who had 64s.

1056
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.760
we were just filled
with jealousy

1057
00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.520
that we could not play a
game that was that good.

1058
00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.080
- I don't think I really
appreciated at the time

1059
00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.360
just how much enthusiasm
that the game.

1060
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.600
you know. the game generated.

1061
00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.920
- I think the enemies really
brought that game to life.

1062
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.640
- You'd occasionally
walk around a corner

1063
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.920
and just find one scratching
their bum or something like that.

1064
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.080
Really. really bizarre.

1065
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.960
But that little
detail made a change.

1066
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.080
- Everyone says it. but
the animations like. ah.

1067
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.960
you shot him in the hand.
he's shaking it around.

1068
00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.200
You shoot him in the knee
or the bum cheek

1069
00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:21.320
and he clenches it?
Brilliant. like number one.

1070
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.920
Then you shoot the
hats off and you think.

1071
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.640
what else can this game do?

1072
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.280
- You could use your
silencer and take out

1073
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.480
enemies without
alerting other guards.

1074
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.320
You could take out
the security cameras.

1075
00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.800
These stealth mechanics
really hadn't been seen.

1076
00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.560
especially in the first-person shooter genre.

1077
00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.320
- Guards were on routes
and everything.

1078
00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.360
and you could memorize them.

1079
00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.240
and you'd know when you
would see their head pop up

1080
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.920
like over a snow dune and
when you could shoot him.

1081
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.560
like I felt like
I was being sneaky

1082
00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:44.880
for the first time in a game.

1083
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.600
- Some of the greatest
memories I have

1084
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.720
is getting through that
level in a certain time limit

1085
00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:55.040
and doing certain conditions
to unlock certain things.

1086
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.400
The feeling of achieving
that was great.

1087
00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.840
- If you wanted to
extend the life

1088
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.160
of the game as a player.

1089
00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.800
you earn that
extension rather than

1090
00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.360
buying it and
downloading it. right?

1091
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.000
And it was always in there.

1092
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.920
- I got every
single one of them.

1093
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.760
except Facility.

1094
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.320
which was just so difficult.

1095
00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.280
- You have to have Dr. Doak

1096
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.920
in the right place
at the right time.

1097
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.520
- You are having the
run of your life.

1098
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.280
but you could never
bank on Dr. Doak

1099
00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.640
being in the right spot.

1100
00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.160
It was just the biggest bunch
of bullshit of all time.

1101
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.760
- The way you shoot him and
then feel slightly bad about it.

1102
00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.120
but it's fun and you can get
away with it. so why not?

1103
00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.080
- I think there's a
certain magic that happens

1104
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.040
that GoldenEye taught all of us.

1105
00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:47.440
that sitting shoulder to shoulder
with somebody on a couch.

1106
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.880
even if we're on
two separate TVs.

1107
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.400
playing something.
getting the reaction.

1108
00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:56.280
feeling the energy. right.
is a magical moment.

1109
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.240
- All you needed
was one Nintendo 64.

1110
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.800
one copy of the game. four
controllers. and a TV.

1111
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.240
The idea that you could
all play on one screen.

1112
00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.080
all four of you
racing down corridors.

1113
00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.880
sniping each other.
laughing your heads off.

1114
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.320
It was as much fun
for an audience

1115
00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.040
as it was for the players. It
was just hysterical to watch.

1116
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.720
- GoldenEye came out
and it brought everyone

1117
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.440
out of their rooms.
out of their bedrooms.

1118
00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.200
into the lounge room
together. you know.

1119
00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.400
shoulder to shoulder.
having a great time.

1120
00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.160
- It was some of the
best times of my life.

1121
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.000
you know. just with my friends.

1122
00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.760
- What was great was
it was so customizable.

1123
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.880
- Custom matches and
the one-shot kills.

1124
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.120
Man with the Golden Gun.
Slappers Only.

1125
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.440
- You'd go to play GoldenEye
at a friend's house

1126
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.240
and you'd choose Oddjob and
everyone would (deep breath)

1127
00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.800
and the guy in the
corner of the room

1128
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.680
would stop playing the piano
and everything like that.

1129
00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.360
It was just not done.

1130
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.560
- He'd be the smallest one.

1131
00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.160
And you'd fight to play Oddjob.

1132
00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.320
- Anyone who chose
Oddjob was the biggest

1133
00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.040
asshole in the lounge room.

1134
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.040
- It just made it all the more
fun. all the more social.

1135
00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.520
And it kind of made me
look forward

1136
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.920
to actually hanging
out with my family.

1137
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.560
which I don't do so much now.

1138
00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.760
- Gaming really is
inherently social.

1139
00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.920
The first games that were
commercial were in arcades

1140
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.400
where you'd have to go out
and be among other people.

1141
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:05.680
Sometimes your friends.

1142
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.800
sometimes you'd meet
complete strangers.

1143
00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.520
And it kind of recreated
that arcade feeling

1144
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.000
of standing behind the
players at the controls.

1145
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.120
putting your quarter on the
dash. and saying. I got next.

1146
00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.200
- After GoldenEye.
every FPS that came out.

1147
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.200
people were asking what
kind of multiplayer modes.

1148
00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.320
how are you handling
split-screen. how does it run?

1149
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.920
- GoldenEye became
the game that set

1150
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.040
the gold standard for
first-person shooters on console.

1151
00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.960
It was the template
that the genre

1152
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.160
would follow on
consoles going forward.

1153
00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.480
- [Presenter] The
interactive title of the year...

1154
00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.480
is GoldenEye.

1155
00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.360
(audience cheers)

1156
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.760
- [Brett Jones] Getting
a BAFTA was awesome.

1157
00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.960
Yeah. especially because it was

1158
00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.320
at the interactive Oscars.

1159
00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.280
Martin had to go up
and give a speech

1160
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.760
and thank everybody for
working on the team.

1161
00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.640
And he mentioned all the
team members by name.

1162
00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.280
and then he paused and he went...

1163
00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.320
- And Duncan Botwood.

1164
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.240
(laughter)

1165
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.720
- Because he'd forgotten him.
That was a good moment.

1166
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.320
- [Steve Ellis] So the whole
team was there

1167
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.360
and it was the first time
they ran those awards

1168
00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.120
and we won four of them.
including the top one.

1169
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.600
So we were pleased with that.

1170
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.200
- We got copies of those.
We've all got copies of those.

1171
00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.600
We had to pay for them
but we got copies of them

1172
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.520
and they say "copy" on the back.

1173
00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:39.440
But they are real BAFTAs
and they weigh a ton

1174
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.880
and I'm very proud of them.
and they sit in my living room

1175
00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.640
and they get
polished once a year.

1176
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.760
- [David Doak] Looking
back at it. I think there was

1177
00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.080
a lot of talent on
the team. you know.

1178
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.760
It's certainly some
of the most talented

1179
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.000
people I've ever worked
with were on that team.

1180
00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.840
- [Graeme Norgate] I still
don't really. you know.

1181
00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.520
I don't even believe
it personally.

1182
00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:00.040
I just. I still
couldn't do the connect

1183
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.120
between what was happening in
the real world. and. you know.

1184
00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.720
what we'd just spent two
and a half years making.

1185
00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.760
- And it's still like. wow.
we did a really good job.

1186
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.200
We have no idea
what we were doing.

1187
00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.040
- Obviously like
the critical acclaims

1188
00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.520
super nice to see.
It was extra special.

1189
00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.840
My first game.
don't get me wrong.

1190
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.560
it's the first box
I had in my hand.

1191
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.880
that was like. oh my God.
I'm on this. you know.

1192
00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.800
But I was slightly detached

1193
00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.200
I guess towards the end of it.

1194
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.440
- GoldenEye kept winning awards.

1195
00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.080
and at some point it
just. I don't know.

1196
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.960
it stopped being a thing
that was very interesting

1197
00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.920
because it just. yeah. it
just won all the awards.

1198
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.240
One thing I do remember
is on the walk back

1199
00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.760
from the AIS awards in
Atlanta back to the hotel.

1200
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.960
I remember saying to the team.

1201
00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.880
it's all downhill from here.

1202
00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.920
We're never going to do
anything else this successful.

1203
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.840
At that point. we'd
just won everything.

1204
00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.440
- [Narrator] With the
game on store shelves

1205
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.240
and the team taking a
well-earned breather.

1206
00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.520
the word on the street
was spreading quickly.

1207
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.480
GoldenEye was the
new game in town.

1208
00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.960
an innovative. boundary pushing

1209
00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.760
cocktail of action-adventure.

1210
00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.760
The game was a critical darling.

1211
00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.360
ushering in new levels of
innovation across areas

1212
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.760
including visuals.
animation. sound.

1213
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:14.720
storytelling. and
artificial intelligence.

1214
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.200
GoldenEye was innovative
in so many ways.

1215
00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:20.840
but one of the most
significant was stealth.

1216
00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.240
Rare replaced the search
and destroy mentality

1217
00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.360
of the Doom genre with
mission objectives.

1218
00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.400
From there on in. the
bullet was no longer

1219
00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.880
the only solution
to every problem.

1220
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.000
This freedom of
choice would have

1221
00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.080
a long lasting impact
on the industry.

1222
00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.720
challenging our expectations
of what games could be

1223
00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.840
and paving the way
for a whole new genre

1224
00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.760
of stealth games
to emerge.

1225
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.480
It was official. James Bond
had arrived in video games.

1226
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.280
selling 8 million copies.
earning critical acclaim.

1227
00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.120
and a host of awards.

1228
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.160
Turns out. the world of
international espionage

1229
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.880
was a perfect formula
for video game success.

1230
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.520
The game was so
successful. in fact.

1231
00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.400
it even surpassed the film.

1232
00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.720
Together. they would
reignite the Bond franchise

1233
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:02.000
and introduced James Bond
to a whole new generation.

1234
00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.560
The big question would be.

1235
00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.680
could future games live up
to the bar set by GoldenEye?

1236
00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:11.280
- [Simon Parkin] Steven Spielberg's
son Max was playing

1237
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.080
GoldenEye with his friends
one day and Spielberg

1238
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.840
walks past and
looks at the telly.

1239
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.880
and at that time I think he
was just coming to the end

1240
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.000
of his work on
Saving Private Ryan

1241
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.320
and can immediately see
the creative synchronicity

1242
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.520
or potential between a
video game like GoldenEye

1243
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.760
with a view through a
first-person perspective

1244
00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:33.240
and a period in history.
such as World War 2.

1245
00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.080
and immediately from
there sort of asks

1246
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:40.360
the designers at Electronic
Arts to mock up an idea

1247
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.800
of how they could
perhaps remodel

1248
00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.760
the Normandy landings.
I believe. or D-Day.

1249
00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.680
using first-person
shooter mechanics.

1250
00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.160
- We all talk about
the flying into the head.

1251
00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:55.840
but that's such a subtle
but important design decision

1252
00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.160
that literally
immerses you in it.

1253
00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.200
Okay. now you are in
the role of James Bond.

1254
00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.920
Now you are this character.

1255
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.200
and now we're going to send
you through this adventure.

1256
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.680
- No one had done
something set in a

1257
00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:11.680
realistic world where. there
were real things there.

1258
00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.360
there were like tanks.
there were jet airplanes.

1259
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:17.240
there were ships.
there were normal guns.

1260
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.640
I say normal guns like machine
guns. silenced pistols.

1261
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.880
sniper rifles. everything
was recognizable.

1262
00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:26.120
including the bad guys.
obviously Russians

1263
00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.320
a lot of the time.

1264
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.320
So all of a sudden
we went from having

1265
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.240
all these fantastical elements

1266
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.600
to you had actually
a real situation

1267
00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:36.040
that you could identify with.

1268
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.880
- And that's something that
has definitely. I think.

1269
00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.640
impacted the single-player
design team on Call of Duty.

1270
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.760
We never take you
out of the role

1271
00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.120
of that person you're playing.

1272
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.480
It is a first-person experience.

1273
00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:51.760
Every action you do. whether
you're climbing up an ice wall

1274
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.480
or whether you're. you know.

1275
00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.240
in an explosion.
you're shell shocked

1276
00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.600
and you're watching the events.

1277
00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.960
you're watching it from
the eyes of that person.

1278
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.320
And I think that's
something that GoldenEye

1279
00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.320
set the standard for

1280
00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.800
because they knocked it out
of the park and they proved

1281
00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.200
to us how effective that can be.

1282
00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:12.000
- [Peer Schneider] I think after
GoldenEye we saw more games

1283
00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:16.120
moving away from hell demons
and dragons

1284
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.320
and fantasy

1285
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.200
and recreating that kind of
more realistic approach.

1286
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.520
Like if you think of the
Tom Clancy's franchise.

1287
00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.760
I think. you know. GoldenEye
really showed everybody

1288
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.720
that you could have. you know.

1289
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.920
this kind of real-world
setting with spies.

1290
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.640
and. you know.
make it a success.

1291
00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.760
- Metal Gear Solid was
still like the next year.

1292
00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:38.040
And a whole host of stealth
games like Thief and Tenchu.

1293
00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:40.400
So they were all. you know.
a year away or so.

1294
00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.960
- [Tommy Thompson] GoldenEye
and its ability to experiment

1295
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.120
becomes a progenitor for games
like Thief: The Dark Project.

1296
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.480
where it's entirely
stealth oriented.

1297
00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.120
- [David Craddock]
GoldenEye was the first

1298
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.160
first-person shooter that actually
made PC developers notice

1299
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.800
the genre on console
and say. oh.

1300
00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.680
we need to do
something like this too

1301
00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.720
or we'll get left behind.

1302
00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.840
- Half-Life came out
after GoldenEye.

1303
00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:04.920
and it was interesting
to hear the developers

1304
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.120
of Half-Life speak about how

1305
00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.600
they were influenced
by GoldenEye.

1306
00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.040
- [David Craddock] They
delayed Half-Life to make sure

1307
00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.720
that Half-Life's AI was up
to snuff with GoldenEye's AI.

1308
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.040
- One of the things
that GoldenEye

1309
00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:19.800
in particular really sells
are moving away.

1310
00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.080
not just from old light gun
games. like Virtua Cop.

1311
00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.800
but even established first-person
shooter franchises

1312
00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.760
like Doom.
is it's the first game

1313
00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.800
that really embodies
systemic design.

1314
00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:33.440
This idea that you
can create a sandbox

1315
00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:36.400
which can just be reduced
to outright anarchy.

1316
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:39.320
where scientists are
running away in panic

1317
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.640
because you're standing
there with two Klobbs

1318
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.520
and shooting just relentlessly

1319
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:47.240
at a couple of soldiers who are
then trying to hit an alarm.

1320
00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.000
but you've also shot
a barrel which then

1321
00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:51.600
causes this cascade
of explosions

1322
00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.240
throughout this room and then
that's catching scientists

1323
00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.640
and killing them
or it's blowing up

1324
00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.440
the guy that you're
trying to hit.

1325
00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:01.280
And these are things that
you can't program that.

1326
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.360
You can only build the
tools within the world

1327
00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:07.400
that enable for these
sorts of things to occur.

1328
00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:11.680
And it's crazy because
now so many big games

1329
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.640
try and embody systemic design.

1330
00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.920
That is literally the
blueprint that Far Cry runs on.

1331
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.480
that they want to have you
be attacked by a tiger.

1332
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.200
but you're also on a paraglider

1333
00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.040
and then you can drop
down and throw a C4

1334
00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.240
on a Jeep. which
lands on a civilian.

1335
00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:30.720
Like these are the things
that now we're expecting.

1336
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.720
People jump into Red
Dead Redemption 2.

1337
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.400
and they get really
excited when someone

1338
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.840
gets kicked in the
face by a horse.

1339
00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.120
But GoldenEye. it
was the first time

1340
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.040
we ever really saw
something like that.

1341
00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:44.320
And then subsequently you
can start manipulating that.

1342
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.440
And that becomes
incredibly fun of. well.

1343
00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:48.240
what happens if I try
and lure the scientists

1344
00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.680
in front of me
because they're trying

1345
00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.960
to run out the back door.

1346
00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.600
but they are trying
to attack me.

1347
00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:56.160
and then can I get them to
shoot the scientists? I wonder.

1348
00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.480
And then you run off as
your own little research

1349
00:56:58.560 --> 00:56:59.760
scientist of your own. you know.

1350
00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.200
you're putting on
your own white coat.

1351
00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.640
like. let's see if we
can just cause chaos

1352
00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.560
and it makes it
insanely replayable.

1353
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.000
- You can draw
a direct line. I think.

1354
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.040
from GoldenEye to Halo.

1355
00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.120
- [James Batchelor] I would
argue that Halo: Combat Evolved

1356
00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:17.120
wouldn't be what it was if
it weren't for GoldenEye.

1357
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.840
I think it followed
kind of the structure of

1358
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.640
what GoldenEye was in terms
of these larger open levels.

1359
00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.320
in terms of this kind of
free flowing 3D movement

1360
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.280
and letting you kind of explore

1361
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.720
the level at your own
kind of pace.

1362
00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.720
I think that influenced
things like Halo

1363
00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.280
and then Halo inspired
Call of Duty and all the others.

1364
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:37.840
It all leads on. it all
influences each other.

1365
00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.440
- After GoldenEye.
we all thought Rare

1366
00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.760
would make another Bond game.

1367
00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.480
I mean. you roll the
credits on GoldenEye.

1368
00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.240
it says James Bond will return.

1369
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.240
And obviously that's
what the movies do.

1370
00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.440
but we all hoped
that Rare was saying.

1371
00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:51.920
hey. we had a blast
making this game.

1372
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.800
We're going to give you
another FPS like GoldenEye.

1373
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.920
maybe for the next Pierce
Brosnan movie. Didn't happen.

1374
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.400
- [Brett Jones] We were going
to do the next Bond license.

1375
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.920
That was the plan.
But because GoldenEye

1376
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.240
sort of reinvigorated
the franchise.

1377
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.840
suddenly the money went up

1378
00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.440
suddenly it's like.
if you want to do this.

1379
00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:09.480
you're gonna have to pay for it.

1380
00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:11.360
- The movie license
wasn't that expensive

1381
00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:13.240
the first time round.
as I understand it.

1382
00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.880
Obviously with the
success of GoldenEye.

1383
00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.480
then the price goes up and
we were told quite early on

1384
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.120
that it's unlikely we
would do the next one

1385
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.840
because they weren't
going to get the license.

1386
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:24.200
You know. you're
slightly disappointed.

1387
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.520
You're also sort of. actually.

1388
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.560
probably it's better to
do our own thing now.

1389
00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:29.480
- We know how to make
a video game now.

1390
00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.720
So we're just going
to make a better one.

1391
00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:35.320
- It's actually really hard
to do spiritual successors.

1392
00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.120
To actually encapsulate
or capture

1393
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.800
what were the magic qualities
of that particular game.

1394
00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.640
- [Stuart Ashen] Can you
recreate something like that?

1395
00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.880
Can you. you know. catch the
lightning in a bottle twice?

1396
00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:47.160
It was very much a
product of the time.

1397
00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:50.360
- People have tried that.
it's super. super. super. hard.

1398
00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:54.080
- [Blaine Morehead] You know.
GoldenEye kind of set up this

1399
00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.800
expectation. I think.
with audiences that. oh.

1400
00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.120
these Bond games
are going to be.

1401
00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:01.320
or at least should be.
as good as GoldenEye.

1402
00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.640
like. you know. Rare
set the standard.

1403
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.160
And so there was just
this expectation in place.

1404
00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.800
- After GoldenEye. the
history of Bond games

1405
00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.360
is very very erratic.

1406
00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:11.920
- I didn't quite realize
how big of a deal

1407
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000
it was that Rare lost
the rights to Bond.

1408
00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.160
in that I heard that Tomorrow
Never Dies was coming out.

1409
00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.360
- Tomorrow Never Dies had a
tie-in on the PlayStation.

1410
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:24.960
And I think that was PlayStation
hoping that. you know.

1411
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.360
well. GoldenEye did
gangbusters for Nintendo.

1412
00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.800
Tomorrow Never Dies
will do the same for us.

1413
00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.720
- Sweet. it's the
sequel to GoldenEye.

1414
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.680
And I remember getting that
and playing it and being like.

1415
00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.200
this is not GoldenEye at
all. This is nothing close.

1416
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.040
Like I don't know.
they really screwed up.

1417
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.080
Like. not knowing that it was
a completely different team.

1418
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.080
different everything.

1419
00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.840
- You're running round levels.

1420
00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.720
like running around
sets to the film.

1421
00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.800
but it wasn't quite as
accurate as Rare had managed.

1422
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.640
I remember reading reviews
of Tomorrow Never Dies.

1423
00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.520
and thinking like.
ah. that's too bad.

1424
00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.160
- You have The World Is
Not Enough afterwards.

1425
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.000
which they kind of like. okay.

1426
00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.000
let's not mess with
the GoldenEye formula.

1427
00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.000
Clearly James Bond
works in first person.

1428
00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.960
We'll do another
first-person shooter.

1429
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.760
And it was good. but it
was another developer

1430
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.680
and it didn't quite have
the same Rare magic.

1431
01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.320
I think it did feel very
kind of A to B.

1432
01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.520
very kind of linear.

1433
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.000
- I remember
thinking that like. okay.

1434
01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.680
this has gotta be the
GoldenEye that I wanted.

1435
01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.280
And it's like. ah.
that's not it either.

1436
01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.560
And then I found out. oh. okay.

1437
01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.320
The team that made
that is making this game

1438
01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.240
called Perfect Dark.

1439
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.120
and that's the closest you're
gonna get to GoldenEye.

1440
01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.600
- [Ad Narrator] Welcome to 2023.

1441
01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.640
- So Perfect Dark
came along in 2000.

1442
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.320
and it was Rare's second
effort in this realm

1443
01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.440
of first-person shooter and
it was highly anticipated.

1444
01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.080
Like yeah. I mean. you
did it right the first time.

1445
01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.200
Let's just do that again.
Just give me more of that.

1446
01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.640
- A big thing with
Perfect Dark was escaping

1447
01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.200
what we saw as the confines
of the GoldenEye universe.

1448
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.400
- We could
make up the storyline.

1449
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.320
we can make up the characters.

1450
01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.440
We could do whatever the
hell we wanted with it.

1451
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.960
We could make it darker.
We could make it bigger.

1452
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.360
We could go into space. We
could have laser pistols.

1453
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.960
You know. that was the point.

1454
01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.520
We could do anything
we wanted with this one

1455
01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.920
because we
weren't restricted.

1456
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.520
- And then
you're on to the next thing.

1457
01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.240
so after GoldenEye we
were doing Perfect Dark

1458
01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.760
and we were going
to make this game

1459
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.200
so much better than GoldenEye.

1460
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.560
- Perfect Dark certainly feels

1461
01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.720
like an evolution of
GoldenEye. It clearly is.

1462
01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.040
It still feels very similar.

1463
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.720
but obviously
everything is opened up.

1464
01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.600
- In a lot of ways.
it was the kind of

1465
01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.400
sequel that the fans wanted.

1466
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.600
It doubled down on the
multiplayer aspect.

1467
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.520
you had bots. you had
much more customization

1468
01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.520
you could do in the multiplayer.
lots more weapons.

1469
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.200
just a huge array of things.

1470
01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.600
But then it went kind
of off the rails.

1471
01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.760
like Indiana Jones 4 style.
with aliens and stuff like that.

1472
01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.000
I don't know.
it got a little silly.

1473
01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.480
- The big fight we had. myself

1474
01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.120
and Martin and
others on the team.

1475
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.320
we really wanted to
have a female character.

1476
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.040
- Jeanne d'Arc. yes.

1477
01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.760
Joan of Arc. that's where
it comes from originally.

1478
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.800
And that was Dr. Doak's idea.

1479
01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.520
- Just because it was such
a misogynist industry.

1480
01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.480
It's nice to look back
on that and to think

1481
01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.040
that we kind of got to
push something there

1482
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.200
because we had some
clout at the time.

1483
01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.640
- Perfect Dark sold a little
over 2 million copies.

1484
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.520
I think. as compared with
GoldenEye's 8 million.

1485
01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.040
- The debate between whether
GoldenEye or Perfect Dark

1486
01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.320
is the better game
is a very complicated one.

1487
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.040
And there's going
to be lots of people

1488
01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.280
on each side of the fence.

1489
01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.240
You can break
Perfect Dark really badly.

1490
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.800
I mean. you can do stuff that
brings the game to a crawl.

1491
01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.600
- [Naz Pattison] Although
certainly what they were

1492
01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.320
doing with bots and
stuff was incredible.

1493
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.360
There are a lot of features.

1494
01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.080
like the counter operative
stuff was amazing.

1495
01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.080
There were so many great ideas
in it. but I think for me.

1496
01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.680
it just didn't come
out at the right time.

1497
01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.680
- GoldenEye just never left
the machine as a multiplayer.

1498
01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.160
And even though Perfect
Dark has more stuff

1499
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.720
going on in there in
terms of AI. weapons.

1500
01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.120
laptop guns. you know.
it has more. but again.

1501
01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.360
when it comes to a quick
plug and play session

1502
01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.480
with your mates.
less is more. you know?

1503
01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.800
(upbeat music)

1504
01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.080
- [Speedrunner] Right here.
it's this one. My insane pace.

1505
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.640
- [Karl Jobst] Oh my God.

1506
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.160
- [Speedrunner]
I wait. I wait. I wait.

1507
01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.480
right when he starts firing
to try to backboost me.

1508
01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.360
The double. Body armor.
Two quick ones.

1509
01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.400
I already know I'm getting
there on the perfect line.

1510
01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.240
Oh. fuck. what a run.

1511
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.160
Fuck.

1512
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.520
I can't even play anymore
tonight after that.

1513
01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.720
It's... I don't know.

1514
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.680
Oh! Fuck!

1515
01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.720
Fuck. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1516
01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.360
- [Ryan White] My friends.
hello and welcome

1517
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.120
to GoldenEye SpeedLore.
the series where

1518
01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.280
we look at the speed run
world record progression

1519
01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.960
of a stage in GoldenEye.
and the stories...

1520
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.280
So speed running is the act
of trying to beat a video game

1521
01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.920
or a part of a video game
as quickly as possible.

1522
01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.000
And it might sound
crazy to some.

1523
01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.120
but it's kind of this
additional challenge

1524
01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.960
that anyone can do in a game.

1525
01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.280
- The cheat system
in GoldenEye was one of

1526
01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.880
the things that really
drove the initial desire

1527
01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.400
to beat the levels fast
because you had to clear

1528
01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.480
a level on a particular
difficulty under a certain time

1529
01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.920
in order to unlock the cheats.

1530
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.080
- Speed running now.
after 2010 or even

1531
01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.440
the mid-2000s. started
getting popularity.

1532
01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.800
but GoldenEye was
big from the start.

1533
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.520
- [Wes McKinney] When I
took over the website.

1534
01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.520
I was updating all of
the records by hand.

1535
01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.960
literally by editing HTML files.

1536
01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.520
And so people would
send me emails

1537
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.440
with all of their new records.

1538
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.480
And then I would go and
manually insert them.

1539
01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.440
When I was 15 years old. it
was a big part of who I was.

1540
01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.600
- If you achieve a good time.

1541
01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.360
you can go online and
say. hey. I did this.

1542
01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.400
And the people who also
share that same passion

1543
01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.080
can give you some
attention and respect.

1544
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.960
- All these teenagers came
together in the late nineties.

1545
01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.480
early 2000s. and became
lifelong friends.

1546
01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.800
- When you get a really
good new untied world record

1547
01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.560
that no one's ever had before.

1548
01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.880
it almost feels like
exploring new lands.

1549
01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.320
- [Wes McKinney] You
would finish the level

1550
01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.400
and there would be. like your
heart would skip two beats.

1551
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.120
and then you would press
A and you'd be like.

1552
01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.040
you know. did I get it?
And be like just... you know.

1553
01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.680
- You're the only
person in the world

1554
01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:33.320
to see those numbers

1555
01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.560
on the end screen of the game.

1556
01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.560
You know. you're it.

1557
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.200
- There's this sort of
psychological catnip

1558
01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.920
that led to this addictive.
kind of obsessive.

1559
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.080
cycle with the game.

1560
01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.040
- There are very few things
that beat that rush still today.

1561
01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.160
I can say that.

1562
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.200
- What would lead
a person to play

1563
01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.120
the same stage a
thousand times in a row?

1564
01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.520
- You see a lot of guys
who maybe. you know.

1565
01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.040
they're not at the best place
in their life at the time.

1566
01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.240
Maybe they've just lost a job

1567
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.520
or gotten out of a
relationship or. you know.

1568
01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.360
maybe they're a bit downtrodden.

1569
01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.200
Speed running can be a natural
kind of place of comfort

1570
01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:16.240
to give them a sense of
direction and focus to carry on.

1571
01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.000
- [Narrator] Fresh off
the success of GoldenEye

1572
01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.160
and deep into production
of Perfect Dark.

1573
01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.240
the unthinkable happened.

1574
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.760
Several key members of the team.

1575
01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:31.000
Hilton. Norgate. Doak. and
Ellis. left the company.

1576
01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.200
setting off to form a new
studio. Free Radical Design.

1577
01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.600
- [Steve Ellis] So we started
off with myself. Dave Doak.

1578
01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.680
Karl Hilton. Graeme
Norgate. and Lee Ray.

1579
01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.080
who all left Rare
roughly at the same time.

1580
01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.360
And we started in April. '99.

1581
01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:52.200
- [Karl Hilton] It was a
hugely difficult decision.

1582
01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.600
In some respects.
I mean. on the one hand.

1583
01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.640
I think we were all ready
to go and do Free Radical.

1584
01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.760
And we were all very excited
by the idea of Free Radical.

1585
01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.040
And we all knew we were
young and confident

1586
01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.600
enough that we thought.
oh. it's going to be.

1587
01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.120
yeah. we'll do this.
It'll be a great success.

1588
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.360
We'll be fine. you know.

1589
01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.840
- It was a thing that I was
thinking about for a while.

1590
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.800
After GoldenEye...

1591
01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.400
I don't know.
I mean. we were young and naive

1592
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.840
and we kind of
felt like we'd done it

1593
01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.880
all ourselves.
which in retrospect.

1594
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.040
I now realize that there
will have been things

1595
01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.680
going on behind the scenes
that we were unaware of

1596
01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.600
that allowed us to have the time

1597
01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.080
that we had to make
that game good.

1598
01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.240
- [Narrator] With
their stock high.

1599
01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.240
they signed an exclusive
deal with publisher Eidos

1600
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.560
to develop a game
for a new console.

1601
01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.760
the Sony PlayStation 2.

1602
01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.920
The new game would
be Time Splitters.

1603
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.520
But could it live up
to the standard

1604
01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.080
they'd set with GoldenEye?

1605
01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.440
- [Karl Hilton] PlayStation
2 was around the corner.

1606
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.840
So as soon as Eidos had
signed us up. you know.

1607
01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.960
then it was straight to Sony.

1608
01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.360
Look. we're going
to make another game.

1609
01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.840
It's going to be a multiplayer.

1610
01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.160
I think your console is clearly
going to be a great console

1611
01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.400
to do it on. and then
Sony was super supportive.

1612
01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.880
and yes. suddenly we had
dev kits in our office.

1613
01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.000
- [Peer Schnieder] We were
all super excited about

1614
01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.440
Free Radical and then after
we played Time Splitters.

1615
01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.160
we really liked what we saw.

1616
01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.640
- We were the only
European-developed launch title.

1617
01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.440
you know. so that was
a very quick sort of.

1618
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.320
here's a fun game.
not much to it.

1619
01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.800
but it's got all
these bits and pieces

1620
01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.960
and have a bit of fun with it.

1621
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.439
- When we made the Time Splitters'
games with Free Radical.

1622
01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.720
it was kind of like.
we want a chocolate box.

1623
01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.439
we want to do everything.
So those games were that.

1624
01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.359
The original Time Splitters
was a multiplayer game.

1625
01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.479
just let's throw everything
and see what sticks.

1626
01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.000
- I think a lot of fans went
to Time Splitters and said.

1627
01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.399
oh my God. this brings
back all the memories

1628
01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:36.560
from GoldenEye and
the way it feels.

1629
01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.439
but what Free Radical
did with that game

1630
01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.640
is just speed it up.

1631
01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:43.399
- It was all about
immediacy and accessibility.

1632
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.720
Pick up and play.

1633
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.840
You should just be able
to start playing.

1634
01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:50.040
choose a bunch of
settings that you fancy

1635
01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.680
at that time and have
fun straightaway.

1636
01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:55.319
- There was no great design
document for Time Splitters

1637
01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:56.279
at the start that said.

1638
01:08:56.359 --> 01:08:58.200
this is the game and this
is how it's going to work

1639
01:08:58.279 --> 01:08:59.600
and this is what things
you're going to do.

1640
01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.800
- It just had such
a nice feel to it.

1641
01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.560
And you could pick
it up and play it

1642
01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.000
without a whole lot of
learning for it as well.

1643
01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.640
which means you can get
people who aren't so

1644
01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.680
big a gamers in on it.
and you could actually

1645
01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.200
have your four
player split-screen

1646
01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:12.720
and everybody's having fun.

1647
01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:16.000
- It wasn't representative
of what we were capable of.

1648
01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.080
It was representative of what
we had enough time to do.

1649
01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:20.960
So Time Splitters 2 was where

1650
01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.200
we wanted to show
what we could do.

1651
01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.640
- Time Splitters 2 was obviously
our chance to do it properly.

1652
01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.240
And we had more time and the
first one had been successful.

1653
01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:35.680
So Eidos were happy
for us to spend

1654
01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.399
a bit more money
and a bit more time

1655
01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:39.319
making a more detailed
one with a proper story.

1656
01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:41.160
and then a bit more
character development in it.

1657
01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.000
- And they were quite hands-off.

1658
01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:48.240
That's a thing that was
also true of GoldenEye.

1659
01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:50.120
I think that's the thing
that makes a big difference

1660
01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.200
to the end result of a project.

1661
01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.480
- [Narrator]
The Time Splitters series

1662
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.440
would go on to be one
of the most successful

1663
01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.320
franchises on the PlayStation 2.

1664
01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.200
selling over 3.5 million
copies on the system

1665
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.000
and earning a dedicated
and passionate fan base.

1666
01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.160
Throughout the mid-2000s.
Free Radical Design

1667
01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.280
would go on to create
titles like Second Sight

1668
01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.160
for the PS2 and
Haze for the PS3.

1669
01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.680
- [Steve Ellis] After we
finished Time Splitters.

1670
01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.760
Lucas Arts approached
us and said

1671
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.520
they'd like us to
make a Star Wars game.

1672
01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.840
- It was a hugely fun
thing to be working on.

1673
01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.200
Obviously the team
was stoked because

1674
01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.920
we got access to
all of the great

1675
01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.880
resources and
history of Star Wars.

1676
01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.720
- [David Doak] I can
remember it just being an

1677
01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.160
absolute joy to go to work.

1678
01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.200
We were making what
we wanted to make.

1679
01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.480
We personally felt vested
in it because we owned

1680
01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.200
the business and we
were creating our thing.

1681
01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.760
- [Narrator] Back at Rare.
change was in the air.

1682
01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.800
The Nintendo deal
had reached its end

1683
01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.800
and Rare needed a new partner.

1684
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.560
Companies like Activision
and Microsoft were circling.

1685
01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.880
And for the successful bidder.

1686
01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.960
the spoils would be
Rare's reputation

1687
01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.760
and its passionate fan base.

1688
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.840
For Rare. it was an
opportunity to secure

1689
01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.040
the long-term viability
of the company.

1690
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.120
but it wouldn't be without risk.

1691
01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.040
The Rare faithful would
have to hold their breath

1692
01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.440
as giant corporations moved in.

1693
01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.240
- [Simon Parkin] Owners of
the company and the founders.

1694
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.480
Chris and Tim stamper. put
the company up for sale.

1695
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.160
And they're looking
to find a buyer.

1696
01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.400
Microsoft's interested.
Activision's interested

1697
01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.360
and Nintendo is interested.

1698
01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.800
And I think a lot of the staff
were like. well. you know.

1699
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.640
hopefully we'll be
acquired fully by Nintendo.

1700
01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:34.600
but Nintendo's CEO at the
time gives them a valuation

1701
01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.240
that's way. way lower
than what they're after.

1702
01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.160
And Activision
puts in a big bid.

1703
01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.960
So it looks for a moment
that they're going to go

1704
01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.680
with Activision. and then
for one reason or another.

1705
01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:43.680
that deal falls through.

1706
01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.760
(Conker yelling)

1707
01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.160
- [James Batchelor] When
Microsoft bought Rare in 2002.

1708
01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.440
I believe it was. I think
they lost a little bit.

1709
01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.800
I think some people at Rare
would kind of agree with that.

1710
01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.000
Case in point.
that's when you started

1711
01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.200
to see people leave Rare
and form Free Radical.

1712
01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.840
Microsoft wanted to
really push Kinect

1713
01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.000
and really want to push this
kind of hands-free control thing.

1714
01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.240
But you had Kinect
Sports. Kinect Adventure.

1715
01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.560
all these kinds of
games that people

1716
01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:08.840
just didn't feel were Rare.

1717
01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.720
You didn't feel that
Rare quality about it

1718
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.480
because they were
mini game collections

1719
01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.520
and that's not really what
Rare did. Rare built worlds.

1720
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.160
- I left Rare because
I became less enamoured

1721
01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.240
with it as time went.
after Tim and Chris left.

1722
01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.160
that was it for me.
I liked them being there.

1723
01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.240
When they left. I don't
think I left long after that.

1724
01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.280
I didn't want to be
there really anymore.

1725
01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.960
- [Steve Ellis] For a long
time we described that as

1726
01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.280
the best publisher
relationship we'd ever had.

1727
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.080
it was working
really. really well.

1728
01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.920
It was going so well
that not long after that.

1729
01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.280
they asked us to
also start working

1730
01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.640
on the sequel at the same time.

1731
01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.800
In order to do that. we
had to grow the company.

1732
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.040
- [David Doak] As it
got bigger and bigger.

1733
01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:51.840
more time was kind of
spent on dealing

1734
01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.840
with the frictions
that you have.

1735
01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.040
particularly with publishers.

1736
01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.480
- It was two and a half years.

1737
01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:01.280
but I mean the
amount of money

1738
01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.520
in at that point would
have been eight figures.

1739
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.160
The funding model then
was publisher advances.

1740
01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.280
And if you have a good
publisher relationship.

1741
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.840
then you're safe.

1742
01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.800
but that relationship has
always got some conflict in it.

1743
01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.040
It got to the point where
we were doing milestones

1744
01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.440
every month and
sending them off.

1745
01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.840
And if the publisher
didn't like what they saw.

1746
01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.160
we wouldn't get paid. and our
burn rate was astronomical.

1747
01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:28.960
So. you know.
it doesn't take much

1748
01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.240
for the wheels to come off.

1749
01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.520
- Unfortunately.
you know. the story was

1750
01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:35.480
not a great one obviously.
you know. the studio

1751
01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.200
running into trouble with
Battlefront development.

1752
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.000
- That becomes quite difficult

1753
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.440
if that goes on for
more than a few months.

1754
01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.240
because everyone
needs to get paid.

1755
01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.400
- When it came to
the end of the year.

1756
01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:53.880
we had to put the company
into administration.

1757
01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.240
- That was gutting. you know.

1758
01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.280
- In almost every
publisher we worked with.

1759
01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.840
there was some
degree of conflict

1760
01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:03.680
and that took us
down in the end.

1761
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.280
(somber music)

1762
01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:17.120
- Today is a culmination of
about three years of planning.

1763
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.040
We're filming an
actual real film

1764
01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.840
called Bringing Back GoldenEye.

1765
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.040
- I'm Dan Guest.
I'm the director

1766
01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.640
of Bringing Back GoldenEye.

1767
01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.640
the mockumentary
written by Jim Miskell.

1768
01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.880
all about the GoldenEye
world championships.

1769
01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.520
- [Jim Miskell] It was the first thing
I'd ever been good at.

1770
01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.120
never mind a game.
and I was amazing at it.

1771
01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.000
So I've written two
films about GoldenEye.

1772
01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.320
Obviously.
this is the second one.

1773
01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.040
First was Going For GoldenEye.

1774
01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.120
I made it myself.
basically wrote it.

1775
01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.960
directed it. produced it.
made the costumes. edited it.

1776
01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.000
I made everything apart
from hold the camera.

1777
01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.480
hold the boom. and
act in it basically.

1778
01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:00.040
And I'd never do that ever
again. It was very stressful.

1779
01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.840
Grant Kirkhope said it
was the film of the year.

1780
01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.720
which. you know. what more
could you want. really?

1781
01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.320
David Doak compared it to
Spinal Tap. King of Kong.

1782
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.320
I'm really happy that
the Rare guys liked it.

1783
01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.760
I'm really. really proud of it
just because I did it.

1784
01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.240
you know. end of the day.

1785
01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.640
a lot of people can say
they're going to do stuff.

1786
01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:21.440
but I'll put my money
where my mouth is.

1787
01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:22.720
And I went through and did it.

1788
01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.800
And I saw it all
the way through.

1789
01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.840
But now I've hired a
lovely crew and producers

1790
01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:30.200
and everything and lots
of lovely actors and.

1791
01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.800
yeah. they're making
an awesome film.

1792
01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.880
- [Dan Guest] It's
written by a massive fan.

1793
01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.400
Jim's just written a
great story with

1794
01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.640
a lot of little inside jokes and
obviously David Doak's involved.

1795
01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.480
And it's just a great nostalgia
trip for fans of the game.

1796
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.160
- What we're filming
these next couple of days

1797
01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:50.720
is the world championships
interior parts of the film.

1798
01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.600
There'll be a hundred extras in.

1799
01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.640
and we've got a stage full of

1800
01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.040
new competitors and characters.

1801
01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.200
So it's going to be a big day.

1802
01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.840
and David Doak from
the GoldenEye team

1803
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.400
is coming to present the trophy.

1804
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.400
Which is just mind blowing

1805
01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.800
because I've shot
that guy in the head

1806
01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.560
so many times in the facility!

1807
01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.280
(upbeat music)

1808
01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.920
I guess the legacy of
GoldenEye is the fans.

1809
01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.000
You know. and what they
do with those memories

1810
01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.360
and how they keep it alive.

1811
01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.520
I mean like. look
what's going on here.

1812
01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.840
To me. I'm hopefully
contributing to the legacy

1813
01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.840
of GoldenEye and people
enjoy what I'm doing

1814
01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:39.680
because. you know.
I think it's important

1815
01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:43.600
that we tell stories
based on video games.

1816
01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.160
You know. we're the first couple

1817
01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:47.760
of generations where
that's our entertainment.

1818
01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.080
And so I'm celebrating this game

1819
01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.760
that's a big part of my life.

1820
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.680
- It's really
interesting when you look

1821
01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.040
at the James Bond games
that came after GoldenEye.

1822
01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.440
The Eurocom Bond games
were pretty competent.

1823
01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:06.000
Some of the more
vehicular-based.

1824
01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:09.040
like some of the other ones
were trying to do some of

1825
01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.400
the stuff that GoldenEye
did. but failed.

1826
01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.680
- [James Batchelor] GoldenEye's the one
that people keep coming back to.

1827
01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.240
When in doubt.
do a GoldenEye.

1828
01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:19.240
So EA did this with
GoldenEye Rogue Agent.

1829
01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.840
You worked for the
villains and there's kind

1830
01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.160
of almost like a mob war.

1831
01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.400
like you're working with
the villains

1832
01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.160
as they kind of fight
against each other.

1833
01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.920
And it was called
GoldenEye because

1834
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.800
he actually has a golden eye.

1835
01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.000
and Activision did the same
thing after Quantum of Solace.

1836
01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.520
was basically a Call of Duty
with a bit of a Bond skin.

1837
01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:38.000
They did the GoldenEye
007 re-imagining for Wii

1838
01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.680
to try and tap in that nostalgia

1839
01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.480
because that's the game
that people remember.

1840
01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.640
That's the game
that people love.

1841
01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:45.280
- [Ad Narrator] Who here
would say that it's one of

1842
01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.000
the greatest shooters of all time?

1843
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.960
- Everybody.
- It set the standard.

1844
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:53.160
- Problem is. as good as
some of these games were.

1845
01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:55.200
none of them match GoldenEye.

1846
01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.520
- Nobody ever got close
to kind of

1847
01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.400
bringing home that magic again.

1848
01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.240
- [Krishan Sharma] I think
by calling it GoldenEye

1849
01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.600
and then releasing a game that

1850
01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:07.920
is not in beat or in tune
with what made

1851
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.880
GoldenEye so special. I
think upset a lot of people.

1852
01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.520
I think a lot of people were
expecting a one-to-one remake.

1853
01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.960
but that's not what they got.

1854
01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.360
(upbeat music)

1855
01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.960
(keyboard clicking)

1856
01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.120
The XBLA remake.
for a lot of us.

1857
01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.040
we had heard rumblings about it.

1858
01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:05.560
- [Blaine Morehead] Sounds
like it was almost at 100%.

1859
01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.400
like it sounds like it was
pretty much ready to go.

1860
01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.040
- [Krishan Sharma]
It was written about

1861
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.200
absolutely by every
major gaming publication

1862
01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.160
and it even actually
did hit a couple

1863
01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.480
of mainstream press as well.

1864
01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.840
- [Journalist] Yes. I was
there. I was part of the staff

1865
01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.080
when the news broke
about a GoldenEye

1866
01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.720
release for the
Xbox Live Arcade.

1867
01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:33.120
I think what made the Rare
employee want to do it

1868
01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.120
was I don't think it had
anything to do with anger.

1869
01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.920
I don't think it had
anything to do with spite.

1870
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.360
I think it was...

1871
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.160
the intention was
to get it out there

1872
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.720
so that the
world could see it.

1873
01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.080
- Just the way those
leaks were released.

1874
01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.000
by almost like a double agent.

1875
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.960
- It's such a shame
that we never got

1876
01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.760
the GoldenEye HD remake
that was rumored

1877
01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.640
for Xbox 360. I think it was.

1878
01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.400
So it was going to be a HD
version of GoldenEye 64.

1879
01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.800
all the levels you
remember. but with kind of

1880
01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:03.200
much more realistic graphics
and online multiplayer.

1881
01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:06.360
and the problem is at the
time. it was such a legal mess.

1882
01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.200
- We're talking. you know.
three. four companies

1883
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.120
that need to all see eye to eye

1884
01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.800
and get a proper
piece of that pie.

1885
01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.360
- Microsoft owned Rare
and Rare owned the game.

1886
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.560
except GoldenEye 64 was
published by Nintendo.

1887
01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.360
so Nintendo had the
rights to that game

1888
01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.640
because Rare worked for
them and was licensed.

1889
01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:23.840
It was all licensed by them.

1890
01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.680
except Activision at the time
had the James Bond license.

1891
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.880
Just became this massive.

1892
01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.960
you've got three
companies arguing over

1893
01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.320
who does and doesn't
have the rights to it.

1894
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.560
And it meant that
ultimately it never came out.

1895
01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.720
(keyboard clicking)

1896
01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:41.720
(upbeat music)

1897
01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.000
(ominous music)

1898
01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.760
- [Krishan Sharma] People who
grew up on GoldenEye are now

1899
01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:14.280
trying to make the remake
that they didn't get.

1900
01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.320
(upbeat music)

1901
01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.520
I mean. we had the Quake engine

1902
01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.040
and the Doom engine
that we. you know.

1903
01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.480
and yet saw some impressive mods

1904
01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.200
that were being made
from those engines.

1905
01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.240
But then Source
engine came along.

1906
01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.680
- GoldenEye: Source
is this project

1907
01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:39.160
that is totally fan
made that is built

1908
01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.360
on the Source engine by Valve.

1909
01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.800
So the engine that
ran Half-Life 2.

1910
01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.560
- GoldenEye: Source is a remake

1911
01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.920
of the multiplayer
component of GoldenEye.

1912
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.560
- [Blaine Morehead] They
have essentially re-imagined

1913
01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.360
the GoldenEye levels
to be remastered

1914
01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.960
to make it look
more like the movie.

1915
01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:01.720
It's higher res textures.
higher polygon count models.

1916
01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:05.520
All the weapons are redone.
sound effects. and music even.

1917
01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:10.080
and all in the spirit of
let's get our favorite

1918
01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:14.480
kind of couch death match
game online

1919
01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.440
so that we can
play it. you know.

1920
01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.000
with people from
all over the world.

1921
01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.640
- [Krishan Sharma] So we didn't
get the remake that we want.

1922
01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:23.200
We constantly hear these
rumblings in the industry

1923
01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.600
about how there is a
GoldenEye out there.

1924
01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.920
remake that is done. It's
just not being released.

1925
01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:32.640
- [Simon Parkin] The inability
for the corporations to

1926
01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:36.080
figure out a way to get a
remastered version of GoldenEye

1927
01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:39.000
out has created a vacuum

1928
01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.760
into which fans have fallen

1929
01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.480
and they're making
their own projects.

1930
01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:47.080
You know. their sort of
black label versions.

1931
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.760
- [Curtis Higgins]
I am Curtis Higgins.

1932
01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.080
I am co-creator of
GoldenEye: Source.

1933
01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:54.560
GoldenEye: Source is a adaptation

1934
01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:59.240
of the original Nintendo 64
game. We started in 2004.

1935
01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.280
The team has touched all
corners of the globe.

1936
01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.080
We currently have
members from Canada. US.

1937
01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.320
Switzerland. UK. Spain.
Australia. Brazil.

1938
01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.440
- Says something about
the fondness that people

1939
01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.560
hold for this game that
they would dedicate

1940
01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.560
so much of their time
to recreating it.

1941
01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.560
you know. either for
their own pleasure.

1942
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.600
but also probably for
younger generations.

1943
01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:23.120
- The cool thing
about indie development

1944
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:26.040
is you can either make
something yourself

1945
01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.160
or get one or two or
three or half a dozen

1946
01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:32.320
of your friends and build
something with tools

1947
01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.680
that are free or cheap
and widely available.

1948
01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.440
- You can learn
how to 3D model

1949
01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.040
with free open
source software now.

1950
01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:43.200
You can learn. you know.
Unreal Engine. Unity.

1951
01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.560
these are free to play
around with game engines.

1952
01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:49.360
- [Krishan Sharma] So
now we have these tools.

1953
01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:52.360
these game development tools.
that we never had before.

1954
01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.720
What's interesting to
see is how these tools

1955
01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:00.080
are being utilized by people
who grew up playing GoldenEye.

1956
01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.000
- [Blaine Morehead] And so that
democratization of the tools

1957
01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.120
is kind of leveling
this whole field

1958
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:08.440
and making these
projects possible.

1959
01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.000
- [Emily Elmund] In the end.
it's just a group of people

1960
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.960
who absolutely love
the original game

1961
01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:18.920
and they just want
to bring an updated.

1962
01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.800
modern version to
people who love it.

1963
01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.760
- No other game that you play.

1964
01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.520
where you're playing Call
of Duty or another game.

1965
01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.720
and you're like. oh. I really
hate the way this happens.

1966
01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.880
all of a sudden a developer
or somebody pops up and goes.

1967
01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.280
oh. I'll change that next week.

1968
01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:33.880
Next thing you know.
all the problems

1969
01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.960
you had with the
game are now fixed.

1970
01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:38.360
- [Tristan Ogilvie] Those teams
that are kind of off the leash

1971
01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:42.280
and can do what they
want without fear of. you know.

1972
01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.600
failing any focus tests
or anything like that.

1973
01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:48.960
- [Grant Kirkhope] Sometimes I
feel like the corporatization

1974
01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.200
of it all has sucked a bit of
the creativity out of it.

1975
01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.480
That's what I feel.

1976
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.440
I like that kind of gamers
making games for gamers model.

1977
01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.480
I kind of feel that's
a great way to do it.

1978
01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.720
- We've had a few
members. they reached out

1979
01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.480
to Dr. Doak on Twitter.

1980
01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:06.400
we arranged a session
where we were able to play.

1981
01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.640
He came in. we played with
him. He played with the team.

1982
01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.960
We were only expecting him
to play for about an hour.

1983
01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:17.600
And he ended up staying
for about five hours.

1984
01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.200
It was definitely a
dream of mine to

1985
01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:24.960
show my work to an
original developer.

1986
01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:29.000
Modding provides an outlet
for your creativity.

1987
01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:32.080
It allows you to try
and fail

1988
01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.920
and you just get to
have fun.

1989
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.920
- [Blaine Morehead]
GoldenEye is still very alive

1990
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.280
and well in the modding scene.

1991
01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.880
You know. when Elon Musk
unveiled the cyber truck.

1992
01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:47.760
it was like a day
or two after that

1993
01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.760
that someone modded the truck

1994
01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.240
into the streets level
and even had. you know.

1995
01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.040
a low poly Elon
Musk in there that

1996
01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:58.480
actually spoke to the
character in the game.

1997
01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:00.280
It's like. it's just
so wonderful that

1998
01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.280
that kind of stuff is out there.

1999
01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.360
- [Donnie York] The
GoldenEye modding scene

2000
01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:07.680
has really exploded with so
many different custom levels.

2001
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.280
There's new sounds.
there's new characters.

2002
01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.920
there's new weapons.
there's new music.

2003
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.200
- One of the things
I really love

2004
01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.840
about GoldenEye 007
is that there's still

2005
01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.600
this community around the world.

2006
01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.040
They're making
mods for the game.

2007
01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.720
- What people can do nowadays
is practically endless.

2008
01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.600
It's constantly evolving.

2009
01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:27.320
What you see one year. the
next year will be even greater.

2010
01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:28.840
There's mods where people have

2011
01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:31.560
completely changed
the style of the game.

2012
01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:34.440
the timeframe. the genre.

2013
01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:37.320
and making world war type games

2014
01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.520
where you might still be Bond.

2015
01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.080
but you're taking on Nazis

2016
01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:45.640
and you're going through
old hangars and streets.

2017
01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:47.840
and you're using
these classic weapons

2018
01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:51.040
that sound extremely
realistic and accurate

2019
01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.200
to the original representation.

2020
01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.520
but then there's other ones
that base themselves

2021
01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.640
on something
completely different.

2022
01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:00.360
- Everything in the game.
from wall textures

2023
01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.520
to weapons. to characters.
to items.

2024
01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:03.640
has been changed.

2025
01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:06.720
- It still has the same physics
and controls and engine.

2026
01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:10.240
but it takes on
a whole new life.

2027
01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:14.200
- These projects are
just amazing efforts.

2028
01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.760
And it's all in
these small modding

2029
01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.520
communities where they crop up.

2030
01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.640
- [Daniel Scales] It's a
very close knit community

2031
01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:23.560
and that's awesome. A lot
of people willing to share

2032
01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.760
and promote other
people's projects

2033
01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.600
and keen to see other
people in industry

2034
01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:31.560
and other developers'
projects do really well.

2035
01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.600
- [Donnie York] We were
all helping each other.

2036
01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.840
Anybody would come
up with an idea

2037
01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:38.600
and if they didn't have
the thought process

2038
01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.640
of how to possibly do it.

2039
01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.320
they might pass it
on to somebody else

2040
01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.720
who is more experienced
and they can try it out

2041
01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.480
and they have different
opinions of their own.

2042
01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.760
And we were all just
kind of banking off

2043
01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.320
each other to come up
with as many cool

2044
01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.760
new discoveries as we could.

2045
01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.920
And it just really
blew the game apart.

2046
01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:56.960
- When you want to talk
about the future of gaming

2047
01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.680
and the company
or group of people

2048
01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:01.440
who are going to move the needle

2049
01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.480
or take the next
evolutionary step.

2050
01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.480
it probably won't be AAA.

2051
01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.640
- I think innovation has
now moved from AAA

2052
01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:09.520
to the indie scene
because the indie scene

2053
01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.560
is basically what Rare
was back in the nineties.

2054
01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:14.080
It's small teams.
pretty inexperienced.

2055
01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.560
doing it out of
the love for making

2056
01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:17.080
something that
they want to make.

2057
01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.640
- [Narrator] In 2012. following
the lackluster 007 Legends.

2058
01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.560
Activision abandoned
the Bond license.

2059
01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.840
James Bond would be
absent from video game

2060
01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.080
store shelves for
nearly 10 years.

2061
01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.720
and discovering
the magic formula

2062
01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.200
of GoldenEye's success
remains elusive to this day.

2063
01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:39.320
- [Peer Schnieder] Nobody
ever got close to

2064
01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.000
kind of bringing home
that magic again.

2065
01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:44.640
And that's. you know.
because maybe it was.

2066
01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.520
everybody tried to
take what GoldenEye

2067
01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.680
had created and tried
to replicate it.

2068
01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:51.760
And so it kind of felt
like more up-to-date.

2069
01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.400
but kind of cheaper
copies of GoldenEye.

2070
01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.920
What we didn't see was
a lot of innovation

2071
01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.080
in the newer Bond
games that really

2072
01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:02.480
kind of maybe also adapted
with what James Bond

2073
01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.440
was becoming in the
Pierce Brosnan era.

2074
01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:08.120
- [Steve Ellis]
I often say. you know.

2075
01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:10.240
when I'm explaining to
newcomers to the industry.

2076
01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.960
that I think a lot
of great games

2077
01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.960
are not necessarily the result
of a great person in charge

2078
01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:20.480
or a great team making the game.

2079
01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:24.840
but they kind of reflect
a great environment

2080
01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.040
that allows them the
flexibility to experiment.

2081
01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.960
- It was
about eight people.

2082
01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:34.360
In my experience.
later in the games industry

2083
01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:36.720
was once you get to
teams which are bigger

2084
01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:39.400
than say the size
of a sports team.

2085
01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:43.440
that network of interpersonal
connections gets fuzzier.

2086
01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:45.760
And also you end up
with a hierarchy

2087
01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.400
because you have to have some
kind of production hierarchy.

2088
01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:51.280
So people don't
feel that empowered.

2089
01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:55.160
Somebody. anyone on the team
could have an idea

2090
01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.880
and within an hour
we could all have discussed it.

2091
01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.800
So we were very agile.

2092
01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.320
- You definitely
feel the presence

2093
01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.840
of corporations a lot more.

2094
01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.640
A lot of the most
prominent UK developers

2095
01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.560
are owned by massive publishers

2096
01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:10.080
or have been owned and shut
down by massive publishers.

2097
01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.200
Rare is owned by
Microsoft. and all right.

2098
01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:14.040
they're allowed to
do their own thing.

2099
01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:16.000
but they are very much doing

2100
01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:17.480
their own thing on
Microsoft's payroll.

2101
01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.640
- Things have become a little
bit more corporate and safe.

2102
01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.760
Generally. I think that's true
of all game development.

2103
01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.080
Some of the risks
that are taken in GoldenEye

2104
01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:27.040
just wouldn't fly
in this day and age.

2105
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.400
Going back to
that inexperienced team.

2106
01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.080
small team. you
know. movie license.

2107
01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.400
even the freedom that
they had with the license

2108
01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.920
these days wouldn't
happen. you know.

2109
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.560
to be able to kind of
include stuff

2110
01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.000
from previous Bond films.
you know. characters.

2111
01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.720
to actually go on the movie set.

2112
01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.320
photograph everything.
going back to that

2113
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.960
and the idea of perfect storm.

2114
01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:45.560
everything kind of
just aligned to create

2115
01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:48.800
this wonderful experience.

2116
01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.640
- The size of their team in
many respects was a strength.

2117
01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:52.920
You know. they didn't
have the problem

2118
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.680
of having sort of
too many shifts.

2119
01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.680
They didn't really have the
problem of too many layers

2120
01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:00.440
of management that a lot of
AAA games have these days.

2121
01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.880
And they didn't
really have anyone

2122
01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:04.720
telling them what they should
do. or more importantly.

2123
01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:06.280
they didn't really have
anyone telling them

2124
01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.240
what they couldn't do. but
they just did everything.

2125
01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:09.960
And they just found a way.

2126
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.800
(somber music)

2127
01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:19.560
- Everything that
I've done since. obviously.

2128
01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.040
comes from the fact
that Martin Hollis

2129
01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:23.040
walked into my room that
morning and I said yes.

2130
01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:25.160
And I shudder when
I think about

2131
01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:27.840
what would have happened
if I had gone. eh. You know!

2132
01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.000
- When people are successful.

2133
01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.080
they're generally successful
because they worked hard

2134
01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:33.600
and they have ability. but
they've always been lucky.

2135
01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:36.240
You know. that's the thing
that they don't tell you.

2136
01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:40.200
- If you didn't
have any one of us

2137
01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:43.520
on the actual team. you wouldn't
have got the same game.

2138
01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.000
- It was
a great project to work on.

2139
01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.640
'Cause it was a
small close knit team

2140
01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:49.560
who were working
with a great license.

2141
01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.720
It's a once in a lifetime
opportunity.

2142
01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.480
We had enormous fun.

2143
01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.680
- It was the right people
at the right time.

2144
01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:58.120
It really was. The fact we all
loved Bond. I loved Bond.

2145
01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.600
we all just loved Bond.
you know. so

2146
01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.680
you just put the extra
effort in. didn't you?

2147
01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.560
- People keep
coming up to me and telling me

2148
01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:05.120
I've changed their childhood

2149
01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:08.120
or taken their childhood.

2150
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.760
- It's surreal
that after all this time

2151
01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:14.080
it's still a thing that
we're talking about.

2152
01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:16.440
It was the first thing that
I did after leaving uni.

2153
01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:19.880
It was literally more
than half of my life ago.

2154
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.640
And here we are
talking about it.

2155
01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.760
- Over 23 years in
or something

2156
01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:28.320
and people will still
remember it fondly

2157
01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.680
and have questions about it.

2158
01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.360
- Although it frustrates
the hell out of me

2159
01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:35.000
that that's the only thing people
remember you for. you know.

2160
01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.000
it's still nice that
you've done that thing

2161
01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.680
and people go.
that was my game.

2162
01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.080
- GoldenEye in one word
for me. is fun.

2163
01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.440
Simple as that. because

2164
01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:46.080
it was just fun to play
from start to finish.

2165
01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:50.240
- Bond. It's just
so very. very Bond.

2166
01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.120
- One word.

2167
01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:55.840
Evolutionary.

2168
01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:58.560
In terms of video games.

2169
01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.240
and me. It evolved me.

2170
01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:04.600
It changed me. It changed
exactly who I am now.

2171
01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:05.840
It's...

2172
01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.680
No other video game will get the
chance to do that again.

2173
01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:12.200
- There was something
very special. that...

2174
01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:15.680
some kind of spark. some kind
of life that GoldenEye had

2175
01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:18.760
that these other Bond
games didn't quite get.

2176
01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.760
as close as they came.

2177
01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.920
- Even 20 years later.
there's a certain.

2178
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.280
you know. je ne sais quoi
about it. but...

2179
01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:30.120
Yeah. if somebody
has a better answer.

2180
01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:32.600
I'd be very interested in that.

2181
01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:36.760
- I'm so glad
that I am my age now

2182
01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:39.880
because I don't want to sound
patronizing or condescending.

2183
01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:42.040
but if you've got
a multiplayer game.

2184
01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.800
just go round your
friend's house and play it.

2185
01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.760
Don't play it online.
Don't. I sound really old.

2186
01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.200
But just sit next
to 'em on a couch

2187
01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:50.400
with two other people
or five people.

2188
01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:53.480
six people. and just
enjoy the game.

2189
01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.240
as well as your...

2190
01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:58.440
your bodies
being next to each other.

2191
01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.320
- You hear all these
stories about how people

2192
01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:06.120
have met and Dave was
halfway across the world

2193
01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:11.120
and because of our
mutual love of a game.

2194
01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.960
we happened to meet.
and that's insane.

2195
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
- GoldenEye: Source
became this big thing.

2196
01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.680
and then that
brought us together

2197
01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:22.000
now that we're young adults

2198
01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.480
and now we're married

2199
01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:28.680
and have a house
because of that game.

2200
01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:30.760
- To think that if we'd
never met in that game.

2201
01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:33.760
we'd never have met in person.

2202
01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.560
It just keeps coming back

2203
01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:38.000
into our lives in some
kind of degree.

2204
01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:40.280
- It grabbed people.

2205
01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.360
I've seen people come and go.

2206
01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.920
and they come back
and they come back

2207
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.240
and they come back because
they can't stay away from it.

2208
01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:49.040
They might go away from
it for a couple years.

2209
01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:52.080
but something about it
always pulls them back in.

2210
01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:54.800
- In the office
at IGN. every day.

2211
01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:57.560
we would boot up GoldenEye
at the end of the day.

2212
01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:59.360
and then people would
forget to go home.

2213
01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.920
It's lovely that
people still loved it.

2214
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.520
It's lovely that we
had such an effect.

2215
01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.320
that people clearly
enjoyed playing it so much.

2216
01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.400
You know. you don't think about
that when you're making it.

2217
01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:09.520
we were having fun playing
it. We knew we liked it.

2218
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.080
And you hope that other
people will like it.

2219
01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:14.040
- It's just
this entire era for me

2220
01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:17.640
of just having fun with
a game that you bought

2221
01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:19.480
and there wasn't anything
else to buy for it.

2222
01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.920
No microtransactions.
no expansions.

2223
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.200
everybody had the same game.

2224
01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:24.920
You just had to sit in
front of the console.

2225
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.840
pick up a controller.
and away you go.

2226
01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.800
- I mean. some people
stormed out the house

2227
01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.000
like almost in tears that they
lost GoldenEye matches.

2228
01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:32.600
You know what I mean?
Because they were like. yeah.

2229
01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:33.640
I'm the best at GoldenEye.

2230
01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.360
Come round Will's on
Saturday and see what happens.

2231
01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.720
You got destroyed. didn't you?

2232
01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.640
Yeah. and they just walk away.

2233
01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.520
and you're like.
see you next week?

2234
01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.000
Yeah. See you...

2235
01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.960
- [Overlapping presenters] We've been
talking about this game for so long.

2236
01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.520
A game from the
olden times.

2237
01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:58.400
...most beloved
licensed video games ever made.

2238
01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:01.440
GoldenEye 007 for Xbox Live...

2239
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.960
- [Narrator] In early 2021.
something remarkable happened.

2240
01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.360
The shelved GoldenEye remake
leaked onto the internet.

2241
01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.760
After being locked
away for over a decade.

2242
01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:15.320
a full play through of the
much anticipated remake

2243
01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:17.360
was streamed online by
the world's most prominent

2244
01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:20.280
GoldenEye streamer. Graslu00.

2245
01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.840
Almost a quarter of a
century after its release.

2246
01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:24.720
players all around the
world came together

2247
01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.720
once again to reconnect
over their favorite game.

2248
01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:30.360
Global news outlets
beamed fresh GoldenEye news

2249
01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:31.880
into living rooms
as the rights holders

2250
01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:33.640
could only watch on as the sales

2251
01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.880
the remake might've
made vanished.

2252
01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:38.320
Deep into the 21st century.

2253
01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.640
nearly 25 years after
its original release.

2254
01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.960
the impact is undeniable.

2255
01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:47.520
Rare's GoldenEye 007 lives on.

2256
01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.680
