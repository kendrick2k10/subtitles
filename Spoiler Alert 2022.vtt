174
00:07:54.517 --> 00:07:56.040
What about you?

175
00:07:56.084 --> 00:07:57.520
Drunkard or junkie?

176
00:07:57.564 --> 00:07:59.609
I'm a photographer.

177
00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:01.698
-Mm. Both. then.

178
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.920
Well. for now. I have a day job
that pays the bills.

179
00:08:05.963 --> 00:08:08.183
-What is that?
-Cosiì.

180
00:08:08.226 --> 00:08:10.664
New York's finest
fast-casual restaurant chain.

181
00:08:10.707 --> 00:08:12.753
Cosiì has the best flatbread
in New York City.

182
00:08:12.796 --> 00:08:16.408
Well. I design their
advertising. store signage.

183
00:08:16.452 --> 00:08:18.846
Did you do the new ads for
the hummus-veggie sandwich?

184
00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:20.761
I did. yes.

185
00:08:20.804 --> 00:08:22.545
-That's one of mine.
-Okay. I'm not even kidding.

186
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:24.025
that is the most beautifully
rendered

187
00:08:24.068 --> 00:08:25.983
hummus and veggie sandwich
I have ever seen.

188
00:08:26.027 --> 00:08:27.507
And I'm a vegetarian.

189
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.378
I've seen a lot of hummus
and veggie pictures.

190
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:30.858
Well. what can I say?

191
00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:33.034
When it comes to lighting
bread. I know what's up.

192
00:08:33.077 --> 00:08:35.776
I do lunch every day at
the Cosiì on 51st and Broadway.

193
00:08:37.604 --> 00:08:42.043
Well. today's your lucky day.
because your. um...

194
00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:44.785
your next two
flatbread sandwiches are on me.

195
00:08:44.828 --> 00:08:47.178
Shut up! Oh. marry me.

196
00:08:47.222 --> 00:08:50.225
Oh. God. Is that too soon
to ask you to marry me?

197
00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:51.705
Thank you.

198
00:08:51.748 --> 00:08:53.271
You're very welcome.

199
00:08:55.578 --> 00:08:58.189
Uh. what's your. um...
what's your take on marriage?

200
00:08:58.233 --> 00:09:00.104
Ooh. a serious discussion.

201
00:09:00.148 --> 00:09:02.716
Well. you know.
it's topical and...

202
00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:05.588
Okay. Well...

203
00:09:05.632 --> 00:09:09.026
I consider myself
a bit of a hopeless romantic.

204
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.376
so I guess that makes me pro.

205
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.815
And I'm guessing that
you kind of feel differently.

206
00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:16.599
Well. aren't we supposed to be
more advanced than that?

207
00:09:16.643 --> 00:09:18.862
I mean. it started as
the literal selling of chattel.

208
00:09:18.906 --> 00:09:21.604
I don't know if I want to be
a part of that ritual.

209
00:09:21.648 --> 00:09:23.563
I-I think some rituals
are kind of sweet.

210
00:09:23.606 --> 00:09:25.565
And some rituals
are actually very important.

211
00:09:25.608 --> 00:09:26.609
Mm.

212
00:09:27.654 --> 00:09:29.307
-What's chattel?
-I don't know.

213
00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:31.483
I think it's. like.
cattle that chats.

214
00:09:31.527 --> 00:09:32.615
Talking cows?

215
00:09:36.445 --> 00:09:37.620
Middle child. two brothers.

216
00:09:37.664 --> 00:09:38.926
We're actually very close.

217
00:09:38.969 --> 00:09:40.362
but they live
in different states.

218
00:09:40.405 --> 00:09:41.406
so we don't see each other
very often.

219
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.930
-Only child.
-Only...

220
00:09:42.973 --> 00:09:44.627
No sisters. no brothers.

221
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:46.716
Childhood obsessions.

222
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.719
Christmas and soaps and...

223
00:09:50.764 --> 00:09:52.200
Christmas and soaps and...?

224
00:09:52.243 --> 00:09:53.636
Nope. there's nothing else.

225
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.378
Christmas and soaps. Period. Go.

226
00:09:56.421 --> 00:09:58.902
Uh. childhood obsession: magic.

227
00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:01.078
My stage name
was Kit the Conjurer.

228
00:10:01.122 --> 00:10:03.777
Kit the Conjurer!
The alliteration.

229
00:10:04.778 --> 00:10:06.344
It's. um... You've got. um...

230
00:10:06.388 --> 00:10:08.259
-What is it? -You've got
something behind your ear.

231
00:10:08.303 --> 00:10:10.174
-What? Wh-Where?
-I... It's...

232
00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:12.307
-Oh. my God.
-Oh. Jesus.

233
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.700
-It's a dinner roll.

234
00:10:13.743 --> 00:10:14.962
How did that get there?

235
00:10:15.005 --> 00:10:16.528
How did you do that?

236
00:10:16.572 --> 00:10:18.661
A magician never reveals
his secrets.

237
00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:21.664
After high school.
I escaped to Los Angeles.

238
00:10:21.708 --> 00:10:23.666
-I went to USC...
-Mm-hmm.

239
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.842
...where I nurtured
my obsession with television.

240
00:10:25.886 --> 00:10:28.149
which led to my current job
at TV Guide.

241
00:10:28.192 --> 00:10:30.412
Which. I am guessing.
you've never even heard of.

242
00:10:30.455 --> 00:10:32.632
No. no. no. My-my parents had
a subscription to TV Guide.

243
00:10:32.675 --> 00:10:33.807
Oh. thank God.

244
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.286
They're retired now.

245
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.637
My dad is
a world-class putterer.

246
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.595
A good guy.

247
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.336
And. um...

248
00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:45.427
my mom is a triathlete.

249
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.995
Your mother's a triath...
As in. like. the whole...

250
00:10:48.038 --> 00:10:49.431
Mm-hmm.
Swimming. biking. running.

251
00:10:49.474 --> 00:10:50.693
-Yep. yep. yep.
-Shut up.

252
00:10:50.737 --> 00:10:52.260
She is exceptionally driven.

253
00:10:52.303 --> 00:10:54.262
-Though not very good.

254
00:10:54.305 --> 00:10:55.437
-Wow.

255
00:10:56.438 --> 00:10:57.744
Are you close with them?

256
00:10:57.787 --> 00:11:00.050
Yeah. I mean. it's...
it's complicated.

257
00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:01.704
But they're great.

258
00:11:01.748 --> 00:11:03.314
They're essentially great.

259
00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:06.361
What about your parents?

260
00:11:08.189 --> 00:11:10.539
Can I just say
that this Diet Coke

261
00:11:10.582 --> 00:11:13.847
is the perfect
syrup-to-carbonation ratio?

262
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.023
This is. like.
Chipotle-level perfect.

263
00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:18.112
No one does Diet Coke
like Chipotle.

264
00:11:19.243 --> 00:11:20.549
Hmm.

265
00:11:22.507 --> 00:11:23.944
They both passed away.

266
00:11:23.987 --> 00:11:26.294
My father died
when I was very young.

267
00:11:26.337 --> 00:11:29.950
And my mother. she got cancer
a few years after that. so...

268
00:11:32.735 --> 00:11:34.215
Yes. it sucked.

269
00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:35.869
I'm so sorry.

270
00:11:36.826 --> 00:11:38.698
It's okay.

271
00:11:40.438 --> 00:11:42.223
Thank you.

272
00:11:46.618 --> 00:11:47.924
-Oh. whoa.
-Watch out.

273
00:11:47.968 --> 00:11:49.621
Maybe we should
go inside somewhere.

274
00:11:49.665 --> 00:11:52.102
I don't really want
to get gay-bashed.

275
00:11:54.017 --> 00:11:57.586
Okay. Well. then let's go
to your place.

276
00:11:57.629 --> 00:12:00.067
I've never been
to Jersey City before.

277
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.851
Plus. I have the. um...

278
00:12:01.895 --> 00:12:03.853
the aforementioned
roommate. so...

279
00:12:03.897 --> 00:12:07.596
I would love to go to my place.
but they just...

280
00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:10.730
they just painted my apartment.
and I'm afraid the fumes

281
00:12:10.773 --> 00:12:13.733
might not be safe to breathe in.

282
00:12:14.777 --> 00:12:16.866
Okay. Fine.

283
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.434
Then... let's go to my place.

284
00:12:19.477 --> 00:12:21.175
Okay. let's do that.

285
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.181
I... I'm hoping
my roommate isn't here.

286
00:12:27.224 --> 00:12:30.358
She's very monosyllabic.

287
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:32.099
Okay.

288
00:12:34.144 --> 00:12:36.407
-Kit?

289
00:12:37.582 --> 00:12:39.541
Hey. Kirby.

290
00:12:40.542 --> 00:12:41.761
Hey.

291
00:12:41.804 --> 00:12:43.937
-Uh. this is Mike.
-Hi. Kirby.

292
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.590
Mike.

293
00:12:45.634 --> 00:12:47.114
Um. we were just gonna...

294
00:12:47.157 --> 00:12:48.506
-You want me to...?
-Yeah.

295
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.639
-Okay. Okay.
-Yeah.

296
00:12:52.902 --> 00:12:55.818
This is my boudoir.

297
00:12:55.862 --> 00:12:57.341
Wow.

298
00:13:01.824 --> 00:13:03.434
This is... This is really cool.

299
00:13:03.478 --> 00:13:05.262
Thanks.

300
00:13:05.306 --> 00:13:08.483
So. she-she's really
monosyllabic.

301
00:13:08.526 --> 00:13:10.615
Oh. yeah. I've never seen her
leave the apartment.

302
00:13:10.659 --> 00:13:13.749
I swear to God
she only eats bagels. toasted.

303
00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:15.142
I have to be nice
to her. though.

304
00:13:15.185 --> 00:13:16.621
She pays more rent than me.

305
00:13:19.059 --> 00:13:20.843
You want some weed?

306
00:13:20.887 --> 00:13:23.150
Oh. no. I'm okay. Thank you.

307
00:13:23.193 --> 00:13:24.455

00:22:55.417 --> 00:22:57.463
Fine. We'll go to my place.

524
00:22:57.506 --> 00:22:59.029
If that's what you want.

525
00:22:59.073 --> 00:23:01.162
-Oh. it's what I want. Michael.
-Okay. then.

526
00:23:01.205 --> 00:23:02.729
-That's what we'll do.
-Mm-hmm.

527
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.645
-We'll go to my place.
-Mm-hmm.

528
00:23:06.994 --> 00:23:08.387
-Now?
-Yeah.

529
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.040
Let's go.

530
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.000
-All right.
-Come on.

531
00:23:13.043 --> 00:23:14.784
Let's go.

532
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.876
And this is the hallway. Just...

533
00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:22.575
Eggshell white on the...

534
00:23:22.618 --> 00:23:24.272
-the wall.
-That's a lovely color.

535
00:23:24.315 --> 00:23:27.318
And. um. here's my door.

536
00:23:27.362 --> 00:23:31.410
This is just your-your...
all-American. typical door.

537
00:23:32.846 --> 00:23:36.415
And so. um. I guess
I'll just open the door

538
00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:38.808
and we can go inside.

539
00:23:38.852 --> 00:23:41.463
Yep. That's-that's usually
how it works. Michael.

540
00:23:41.507 --> 00:23:43.987
Before we go in.
I want to remind you

541
00:23:44.031 --> 00:23:47.643
that your friends said
that they really like me.

542
00:23:47.687 --> 00:23:49.297
Oh. Jesus. Just open the door.

543
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.907
Okay.

544
00:23:51.952 --> 00:23:54.998
-I mean. I'm just a person
like everybody. -

545
00:23:55.042 --> 00:23:57.348
Come on. Let me see
your apartment.

546
00:23:58.698 --> 00:24:00.482
Come on.

547
00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:01.657
Okay.

548
00:24:04.486 --> 00:24:07.315
Okay. So. um...

549
00:24:07.358 --> 00:24:10.971
this-this is where I live.

550
00:24:11.014 --> 00:24:12.929
My apartment.

551
00:24:12.973 --> 00:24:15.889
♪

552
00:24:15.932 --> 00:24:17.456
Home sweet home.

553
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.600
Okay. Um...

554
00:24:32.862 --> 00:24:34.385
-Oh. you don't want to...
-Oh. my God.

555
00:24:34.429 --> 00:24:36.039
-They're in here. too.
-...go in the bedroom.

556
00:24:47.094 --> 00:24:48.878
Oh. Papa.

557
00:24:56.582 --> 00:24:58.627
What is this. Michael?

558
00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:01.369
They're Smurfs.

559
00:25:01.412 --> 00:25:03.937
Yes. I... I can see that.

560
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.287
Is it... Is it a fetish?

561
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:07.941
Oh. God. no.
This is not a fetish.

562
00:25:07.984 --> 00:25:09.464
No. this is. uh...

563
00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:10.813
I guess it's a hobby.

564
00:25:10.857 --> 00:25:12.554
Or. uh. maybe it's a passion.

565
00:25:12.598 --> 00:25:15.296
Uh. I started collecting these
when I was ten.

566
00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:17.037
It was my friend
Linda Swzedo's fault.

567
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.473
She got me into them.

568
00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:20.301
She was totally obsessed
with them.

569
00:25:20.344 --> 00:25:21.998
and then I became obsessed. too.

570
00:25:22.042 --> 00:25:25.480
Uh. my mother would take me
to Gift Expressions

571
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:28.222
every Sunday after
I helped her grocery shop.

572
00:25:28.265 --> 00:25:32.705
and she would buy me a Smurf
figurine as-as a reward.

573
00:25:32.748 --> 00:25:34.576
My favorite was Vanity Smurf.

574
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.970
who I now realize
was a total closet case.

575
00:25:37.013 --> 00:25:39.059
Like I was. And then...

576
00:25:39.102 --> 00:25:40.669
I don't know. after my mom died.

577
00:25:40.713 --> 00:25:43.106
I did take a ten-year
Smurf sabbatical.

578
00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.717
But along came eBay.

579
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.154
and then I just kind of...
all hell broke loose.

580
00:25:47.197 --> 00:25:49.852
I started going to toy shows.
and I went to flea markets.

581
00:25:49.896 --> 00:25:51.680
I was buying
and selling and trad...

582
00:25:51.724 --> 00:25:54.117
And I-I really can't
defend this.

583
00:25:56.467 --> 00:25:57.904
Yeah.

584
00:25:58.905 --> 00:26:02.343
I think that they take me
back in time.

585
00:26:02.386 --> 00:26:05.999
You know. like...

586
00:26:06.042 --> 00:26:08.001
to before my mom died.

587
00:26:08.044 --> 00:26:10.525
-When...

588
00:26:12.179 --> 00:26:14.181
When things were easier.

589
00:26:15.138 --> 00:26:18.489
I think that you can imagine
why I was a little hesitant

590
00:26:18.533 --> 00:26:20.491
to bring you to my apartment.

591
00:26:24.757 --> 00:26:26.585
Say something.

592
00:26:27.673 --> 00:26:30.284
I. uh...

593
00:26:35.681 --> 00:26:37.770
I fooled around with someone.

594
00:26:37.813 --> 00:26:40.076
At the gym last week.

595
00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:44.080
I know that you and I
have never had

596
00:26:44.124 --> 00:26:46.648
the "exclusive" conversation.
and-and-and...

597
00:26:46.692 --> 00:26:49.259
I don't know. I. um...

598
00:26:49.303 --> 00:26:51.261
I feel guilty about it.

599
00:26:51.305 --> 00:26:53.655
Why are you telling me this?

600
00:26:53.699 --> 00:26:55.657
Because I feel guilty about it.

601
00:26:55.701 --> 00:26:58.355
And that's new for me. Michael.

602
00:26:58.399 --> 00:27:00.662
You know. I've never actually
had a real relationship before.

603
00:27:00.706 --> 00:27:02.490
A... a-a boyfriend.

604
00:27:02.533 --> 00:27:05.449
Uh. just a lot
of casual hookups.

605
00:27:05.493 --> 00:27:08.409
And. you know. I don't usually
want more than that. but...

606
00:27:08.452 --> 00:27:11.107
If-if someone gets too attached.

607
00:27:11.151 --> 00:27:15.546
I-I get out of there.
and-and-and this...

608
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.114
you...

609
00:27:18.158 --> 00:27:20.421
it scares me.

610
00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.127
You scare me. too.

611
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:34.740
I think you're very cool.

612
00:27:34.783 --> 00:27:37.394
I think your friends
are very cool.

613
00:27:37.438 --> 00:27:39.701
And I now know
that you go to the gym

614
00:27:39.745 --> 00:27:42.965
for things other than
weight lifting and treadmill.

615
00:27:43.009 --> 00:27:46.055
And I'm worried that

616
00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:49.015
I'm going to fall
in love with you

617
00:27:49.058 --> 00:27:51.321
and you're going
to break my heart.

618
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.412
That scares me.

619
00:27:57.501 --> 00:27:59.460
I guess we scare each other.

620
00:27:59.503 --> 00:28:01.549
I guess we do.

621
00:28:03.986 --> 00:28:06.597
MICHAEL:
Smurfgate almost derailed us.

622
00:28:06.641 --> 00:28:09.165
but by Christmas.
we were back on track.

623
00:28:10.645 --> 00:28:12.386
-Merry Christmas.

624
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.695
KIT:
How old is this thing?

625
00:28:16.738 --> 00:28:18.871
1960s. So. I mean.
it's not exactly your childhood.

626
00:28:18.914 --> 00:28:20.481
-but you know...

627
00:28:20.524 --> 00:28:21.830
It's got the...
it's got the wand and the cups

628
00:28:21.874 --> 00:28:23.745
and the lady
that you saw in half.

629
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:25.051
Um. where did you get it?

630
00:28:25.094 --> 00:28:27.270
Oh. you could buy anything
on eBay.

631
00:28:27.314 --> 00:28:28.837
It's really special. Mike.

632
00:28:28.881 --> 00:28:30.578
You'll be happy to know
that I was able to resist

633
00:28:30.621 --> 00:28:33.276
a super rare Christmas Carol
Smurf that was $300.

634
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.625
Oh. must have taken
a lot of self-control.

635
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:36.758
-It did.

636
00:28:36.802 --> 00:28:38.368
-I love it.
-Good.

637
00:28:38.412 --> 00:28:39.761
Thank you.

638
00:28:42.938 --> 00:28:45.245
-I got you something.
-You did?

639
00:28:45.288 --> 00:28:46.899
Stand up.

640
00:28:46.942 --> 00:28:48.770
Not as good as yours.

641
00:28:51.947 --> 00:28:53.470
Close your eyes.

642
00:28:53.514 --> 00:28:55.255
-Close your eyes.
-Okay.

643
00:28:55.298 --> 00:28:57.039
-You better be very careful.
-I'm gonna be very careful.

644
00:28:57.083 --> 00:28:58.649
-I don't like this at all.
-You're very important to me.

645
00:28:58.693 --> 00:29:00.173
I just don't like
walking blind like this.

646
00:29:00.216 --> 00:29:02.088
Well. okay. I think we've
gotten to the point in

647
00:29:02.131 --> 00:29:03.959
our relationship where you can
trust me a month and a half in.

648
00:29:04.003 --> 00:29:05.613
I-I do. I just...
I hate a stubbed toe.

649
00:29:05.656 --> 00:29:06.875
Ooh. your shoulders feel great.

650
00:29:06.919 --> 00:29:09.051
-Oh. thank you.
-Mm.

651
00:29:09.095 --> 00:29:10.270
-Okay.
-Okay.

652
00:29:10.313 --> 00:29:11.445
Now. you just stay there.

653
00:29:11.488 --> 00:29:13.229
-Okay.
-Okay.

654
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.102
-Okay.
-Oh. God.

655
00:29:16.145 --> 00:29:18.234
-Am I going back in the closet?
-Oh. they wouldn't accept you.

656
00:29:18.278 --> 00:29:21.237
:
That's mean.

657
00:29:21.281 --> 00:29:23.892
-Okay. And...
-Okay.

658
00:29:23.936 --> 00:29:27.113
Open your eyes. Ta-da!

659
00:29:27.156 --> 00:29:30.116
Your very own closet space.

660
00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:32.335
-Did you... Did you make that?
-I did.

661
00:29:32.379 --> 00:29:34.424
You can put
your sleep shorts here.

662
00:29:34.468 --> 00:29:37.993
And you can hang your pants
on a hanger.

663
00:29:38.037 --> 00:29:39.778
Put them here.

664
00:29:39.821 --> 00:29:41.867
And your wallet and your keys
in the sundries box.

665
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.130
That's where the sundries go.

666
00:29:44.173 --> 00:29:45.305
Merry Christmas.

667
00:29:48.569 --> 00:29:50.701
-You're staring at me.
-Yes.

668
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.402
-I love...
-Love you.

669
00:29:55.445 --> 00:29:56.838
-What the hell?
-Oh.

670
00:29:56.882 --> 00:29:58.753
-That was my line.
-Well. you hesitated.

671
00:29:58.797 --> 00:29:59.885
-You snooze. you lose.
-No.

672
00:29:59.928 --> 00:30:01.234
-I did not hesitate.
-You did.

673
00:30:01.277 --> 00:30:02.583
I was giving the words
room to breathe.

674
00:30:02.626 --> 00:30:04.193
Well. let the record show
I said it first.

675
00:30:04.237 --> 00:30:05.847
Kit. at the very least.

676
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:07.588
we-we've said it
at the same time.

677
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:08.502
That's not what
the record shows.

678
00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:09.851
I love you.

679
00:30:10.983 --> 00:30:12.811
I love you. too.

680
00:30:16.727 --> 00:30:18.120
WOMAN :
Dr. Patel to CCU.

681
00:30:18.164 --> 00:30:20.296
Dr. Patel to CCU.

682
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.037
MICHAEL:
Don't worry.

683
00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:23.865
We're not at the bad part yet.

684
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:25.562
-How's he doing?
-Good.

685
00:30:25.606 --> 00:30:26.999
He's been dozing in and out.

686
00:30:27.042 --> 00:30:28.870
Are you family?

687
00:30:28.914 --> 00:30:30.176
Oh. uh. no. I'm his boyfriend.

688
00:30:34.136 --> 00:30:35.964
Oh. God.

689
00:30:37.226 --> 00:30:38.880
-Are you gonna get that?
-It's his mother.

690
00:30:38.924 --> 00:30:40.882
He told me to call her
and tell her not to come.

691
00:30:40.926 --> 00:30:42.057
I've never even met the woman.

692
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:43.624
Oh.

693
00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:45.582
Hello?

694
00:30:45.626 --> 00:30:47.758
Hi. Mrs. Cowan.

695
00:30:47.802 --> 00:30:49.760
Yes. this is Michael.

696
00:30:49.804 --> 00:30:51.632
Ausiello.

697
00:30:51.675 --> 00:30:53.503
Yes. Kit's doing fine.

I ask him to join me.
but he refuses.

1041
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:07.182
You might actually enjoy it.
Michael.

1042
00:45:07.226 --> 00:45:08.618
He always asks me this.

1043
00:45:08.662 --> 00:45:09.968
and I always tell him
the same thing:

1044
00:45:10.011 --> 00:45:11.665
"Thanks. Cherry Garcia.
I'm good."

1045
00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:13.145
It's Jerry Garcia.
not Cherry Garcia.

1046
00:45:13.188 --> 00:45:14.842
Cherry Garcia is
a flavor of ice cream.

1047
00:45:15.843 --> 00:45:17.323
Is that true?

1048
00:45:17.366 --> 00:45:19.107
When I first met him.
he only drank Diet Coke.

1049
00:45:19.151 --> 00:45:20.761
and now he drinks
a bottle of wine a night.

1050
00:45:20.805 --> 00:45:21.893
It relaxes me.
It takes the edge off.

1051
00:45:21.936 --> 00:45:23.764
I think I've earned that.

1052
00:45:23.808 --> 00:45:25.070
By the time we've finished
dinner and started Drag Race.

1053
00:45:25.113 --> 00:45:26.985
he's well into
his second bottle.

1054
00:45:27.028 --> 00:45:28.987
Drag Raceis only on Mondays.
It's a Monday show.

1055
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:30.336
While I'm doing
my bedtime routine.

1056
00:45:30.379 --> 00:45:31.641
he carries on drinking
and watching TV.

1057
00:45:31.685 --> 00:45:33.643
What he's not telling you
is that

1058
00:45:33.687 --> 00:45:35.428
his bedtime routine
lasts 90 minutes.

1059
00:45:35.471 --> 00:45:37.604
-What's he doing?
-It's my alone time.

1060
00:45:37.647 --> 00:45:38.648
When Kit and I
first started dating.

1061
00:45:38.692 --> 00:45:40.215
he didn't even own a television.

1062
00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:42.435
and now I feel like
he watches more than I do.

1063
00:45:42.478 --> 00:45:43.958
How would you know?
You're never home.

1064
00:45:44.002 --> 00:45:45.177
He never leaves the office.
which is weird.

1065
00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.700
And how hard can it possibly be

1066
00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:48.223
to recap an episode
of Grey's Anatomy?

1067
00:45:48.267 --> 00:45:50.791
That is a deceptively
complex show.

1068
00:45:50.835 --> 00:45:52.010
Have you seen it?

1069
00:45:52.053 --> 00:45:53.794
I-I know of it.

1070
00:45:53.838 --> 00:45:55.665
He has an insane flirtation
with Tom Daley.

1071
00:45:55.709 --> 00:45:57.189
The Olympic diver?

1072
00:45:57.232 --> 00:45:58.930
His name's Sebastian.
and he's my coworker.

1073
00:46:00.583 --> 00:46:02.150
-Hey. Claire.
-Hi. Michael.

1074
00:46:02.194 --> 00:46:04.109
Let me just wrap up
these things. then we can...

1075
00:46:04.152 --> 00:46:05.937
I'll do my best.

1076
00:46:10.376 --> 00:46:11.943
ANNOUNCER:
Thomas Daley. Great Britain.

1077
00:46:11.986 --> 00:46:13.422
-8.5. 8.5...
-They charge by the hour.

1078
00:46:13.466 --> 00:46:14.684
I'm gonna go set up
an invoice for them.

1079
00:46:14.728 --> 00:46:16.817
Hey.

1080
00:46:16.861 --> 00:46:19.167
I'm so sorry I missed
the reception. How did it go?

1081
00:46:19.211 --> 00:46:21.648
-Yeah. Yeah. it was good.
-Stupid cabbie.

1082
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:23.128
Took the Manhattan Bridge

1083
00:46:23.171 --> 00:46:24.782
when I told him.
"Take the tunnel."

1084
00:46:24.825 --> 00:46:26.305
Well. you should've just
taken it home.

1085
00:46:26.348 --> 00:46:28.046
because everyone's left already.

1086
00:46:28.089 --> 00:46:29.438
I'm sorry.

1087
00:46:29.482 --> 00:46:31.832
Why don't you go home
and unpack.

1088
00:46:31.876 --> 00:46:34.400
and. you know.
I'm just gonna stay here.

1089
00:46:34.443 --> 00:46:36.924
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1090
00:46:36.968 --> 00:46:38.273
I'll see you at home.

1091
00:46:38.317 --> 00:46:40.406
Okay. I'll see you later.

1092
00:46:40.449 --> 00:46:41.973
Okay. fine.
He's Tom Daley's doppelgaänger.

1093
00:46:42.016 --> 00:46:43.844
if you want to be
technical about it.

1094
00:46:43.888 --> 00:46:45.498
Are we not supposed to talk
to each other. Michael?

1095
00:46:45.541 --> 00:46:46.891
I don't know if that's
all you're doing is talking.

1096
00:46:46.934 --> 00:46:48.327
I don't want to talk about this.

1097
00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:49.415
You don't want
to talk about anything.

1098
00:46:49.458 --> 00:46:50.851
He never talks about anything.

1099
00:46:50.895 --> 00:46:53.723
You sure? You don't want
to talk about it?

1100
00:46:55.769 --> 00:46:57.945
New Jersey police
recently arrested a man

1101
00:46:57.989 --> 00:47:00.774
for bringing a doughnut
filled with Xanax pills

1102
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:02.558
to a local
high school student...

1103
00:47:02.602 --> 00:47:03.995
Hey. you're still up.

1104
00:47:08.303 --> 00:47:10.349
Must have had a lot
of cleaning up to do.

1105
00:47:10.392 --> 00:47:11.872
Yeah.

1106
00:47:11.916 --> 00:47:14.092
Then a few of us went out
for a bite to eat after.

1107
00:47:14.135 --> 00:47:16.398
Who all went?

1108
00:47:16.442 --> 00:47:18.661
Just the usual suspects.

1109
00:47:19.967 --> 00:47:22.491
-Was Sebastian there?
-Yes.

1110
00:47:22.535 --> 00:47:24.972
He was. Is that a problem?

1111
00:47:27.148 --> 00:47:29.411
I don't know. Is it?

1112
00:47:29.455 --> 00:47:31.022
I work with him. Michael.

1113
00:47:31.065 --> 00:47:32.980
Am I not allowed to go
to dinner with a coworker?

1114
00:47:33.024 --> 00:47:35.200
You know what. let me just...
Forget it.

1115
00:47:37.028 --> 00:47:39.726
You're just gonna walk off?
That's not fair.

1116
00:47:39.769 --> 00:47:41.728
I'm the one that's being blown
off. and you're acting hurt

1117
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:43.382
like you're the victim?
How is that fair?

1118
00:47:43.425 --> 00:47:44.905
-I said forget it. It's fine.
-No. It's not fine.

1119
00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:46.602
We don't need to talk
about this right now.

1120
00:47:46.646 --> 00:47:47.821
We do need to talk about it.
There are a lot of things

1121
00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:49.431
-we need to talk about.

1122
00:47:49.475 --> 00:47:50.824
It's not the first time
you haven't been there.

1123
00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:52.739
-It's happened a lot.
-And I apologize.

1124
00:47:52.782 --> 00:47:55.611
I'm sorry I have deadlines.
but my readers depend upon me.

1125
00:47:55.655 --> 00:47:57.352
It's TV. Mike.
You're not saving the world.

1126
00:47:57.396 --> 00:47:59.572
-It's not art. -What do you
want me to say. Kit?

1127
00:47:59.615 --> 00:48:02.096
That I'm sorry I make money?
I'm sorry I have to travel

1128
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.098
-in order to pay our mortgage?
-Okay. Mike.

1129
00:48:04.142 --> 00:48:05.926
And while I'm out there
working my ass off.

1130
00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:07.710
you're back here doing
God knows what

1131
00:48:07.754 --> 00:48:10.844
with Nina and Sebastian.
going to. what. art openings?

1132
00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:12.585
Jerking each other off
over stupid side tables?

1133
00:48:12.628 --> 00:48:14.674
Yes. that is exactly what I do.

1134
00:48:17.372 --> 00:48:19.722
We're just in very different
worlds right now.

1135
00:48:21.159 --> 00:48:23.335
Yeah. we're in very different
worlds right now.

1136
00:48:23.378 --> 00:48:24.684
I agree.

1137
00:48:27.295 --> 00:48:29.471
So. you want to hear
my assessment?

1138
00:48:29.515 --> 00:48:31.517
Yes. Absolutely.

1139
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.345
I think you guys resent
each other.

1140
00:48:34.781 --> 00:48:37.871
But you love each other
too much to part ways.

1141
00:48:39.873 --> 00:48:43.659
I think you may need
to spend time apart

1142
00:48:43.703 --> 00:48:46.053
if you really want
to come back together.

1143
00:48:50.014 --> 00:48:53.060
We're actually currently
living in separate apartments.

1144
00:48:53.104 --> 00:48:54.714
-I'm living here.
-And. uh.

1145
00:48:54.757 --> 00:48:56.107
I have a place in Brooklyn.

1146
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.891
I've been there. It's small.

1147
00:48:57.935 --> 00:48:59.632
But nice.

1148
00:48:59.675 --> 00:49:01.416
-But small.

1149
00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.679
-But nice.
-Nice.

1150
00:49:03.723 --> 00:49:05.290
So. you're broken up?

1151
00:49:05.333 --> 00:49:08.467
We're taking some time
to figure some things out.

1152
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.821
But honestly.
to your wonderful togetherness.

1153
00:49:14.864 --> 00:49:16.649
-Okay. let's eat.

1154
00:49:18.129 --> 00:49:20.305
-You put that down.
-Yes!

1155
00:49:20.348 --> 00:49:22.785
-Okay. Now. come back.
Come dance. -Oh. okay. Dancing.

1156
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:24.570
-Yes!

1157
00:49:24.613 --> 00:49:26.267
♪ Dig

1158
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:44.242
♪ I couldn't ask for another

1159
00:49:48.072 --> 00:49:49.508
♪ You know that's right

1160
00:49:49.551 --> 00:49:51.336
♪ Your groove I do deeply dig

1161
00:49:51.379 --> 00:49:53.555
♪ No walls. only the bridge...

1162
00:49:53.599 --> 00:49:55.644
Hey. come dance.

1163
00:49:58.734 --> 00:50:00.388
NINA:
Boring.

1164
00:50:13.488 --> 00:50:15.012
-You guys. so fun.
-Thank you.

1165
00:50:15.055 --> 00:50:16.578
And I'm taking a little cake
for the road.

1166
00:50:16.622 --> 00:50:18.145
-Yes. I see.
-A little cake?

1167
00:50:18.189 --> 00:50:19.233
-Nick. Jesus.
-Just a little. -A lot of cake.

1168
00:50:19.277 --> 00:50:20.278
I'm so happy to have met you.

1169
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:21.670
I'm having people over tomorrow.

1170
00:50:21.714 --> 00:50:22.889
-You big bitch.
-Sorry.

1171
00:50:22.932 --> 00:50:25.152
-Whoa.
-Good night. So much fun.

1172
00:50:25.196 --> 00:50:26.719
-See you soon. -Seriously.
this was so wonderful.

1173
00:50:26.762 --> 00:50:28.155
NICK:
All right. thank you. queens.

1174
00:50:28.199 --> 00:50:29.809
-Thank you for being here.
-Bye. I love you.

1175
00:50:29.852 --> 00:50:31.332
-Happy holidays.
-Get home safe.

1176
00:50:31.376 --> 00:50:33.117
-Love you. Bye. guys.
-Thanks again. really.

1177
00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.770
NINA:
Am I taking a cab or...

1178
00:50:34.814 --> 00:50:36.511
MICHAEL:
Bye.

1179
00:50:39.079 --> 00:50:40.428
That was a great party. Mike.

1180
00:50:40.472 --> 00:50:41.951
-It was. right?
-Mm-hmm.

1181
00:50:41.995 --> 00:50:44.041
It was really nice.

1182
00:50:45.216 --> 00:50:46.521
You okay?

1183
00:50:46.565 --> 00:50:48.436
Yeah. I'm good.

1184
00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.482
Are you still good
for Tony on Wednesday?

1185
00:50:50.525 --> 00:50:52.353
-Yeah. of course.
-Okay.

1186
00:50:52.397 --> 00:50:54.094
Did you want me to stay
and help you

1187
00:50:54.138 --> 00:50:56.227
-with the cleaning and the...
-Oh. no. God. no. Please.

1188
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:57.750
Thank you. though.

1189
00:50:58.968 --> 00:51:00.840
-Okay.
-Okay.

1190
00:51:04.365 --> 00:51:06.019
Kit. what is going on?

1191
00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:07.716
-Are you all right?

1192
00:51:08.717 --> 00:51:11.024
There's something not right
with my ass.

1193
00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:13.809
It feels like I've got
a golf ball lodged up there.

1194
00:51:13.853 --> 00:51:15.811
-A golf ball?
-Yeah.

1195
00:51:15.855 --> 00:51:18.249
It's probably just
a hemorrhoid or something.

1196
00:51:19.946 --> 00:51:21.904
Come down off the ledge. Mike.

1197
00:51:21.948 --> 00:51:24.603
I'm seeing a doctor tomorrow.
I've booked an appointment.

1198
00:51:24.646 --> 00:51:26.561
Will you tell me what they say?

1199
00:51:26.605 --> 00:51:28.085
Of course.

1200
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.652
Thank you.

1201
00:51:40.532 --> 00:51:41.707
Okay.

1202
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:43.404
Okay. bye!

1203
00:51:43.448 --> 00:51:45.754
Bye!

1204
00:51:47.756 --> 00:51:49.410
Be safe.

1205
00:51:49.454 --> 00:51:50.803
I will.

1206
00:51:50.846 --> 00:51:52.457
Merry Christmas.

1207
00:52:02.162 --> 00:52:03.859
Okay.

1208

1209
00:52:05.774 --> 00:52:07.428
-It's so good to see you.
-It's so good to see you. too.

1210
00:52:07.472 --> 00:52:08.908
Thank you for coming here today.

1211
00:52:08.951 --> 00:52:10.257
-Absolutely.
-Yes. Really appreciate it.

1212
00:52:10.301 --> 00:52:11.911
Congrats on the launch
of TVLine.

1213
00:52:11.954 --> 00:52:13.434
Oh. Thank you.

1214
00:52:13.478 --> 00:52:14.870
You look incredible. by the way.

You... Ooh. Kelly.

1217
00:52:17.743 --> 00:52:19.832
I need to take this real quick
before we start.

1218
00:52:19.875 --> 00:52:21.399
-Okay.
-I'm sorry about that.

1219
00:52:21.442 --> 00:52:22.965
-I'll be right back.
-Okay. cool.

1220
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:25.446
Hey. What happened?

1221
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:27.100
KIT:
Uh. they found a growth.

1222
00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:28.536
Wait. Uh. wh-what do you mean?

1223
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:29.972
They found a growth in my butt.

1224
00:52:30.016 --> 00:52:31.496
Uh. but the doctor said
there are

1225
00:52:31.539 --> 00:52:33.019
a hundred things it could be
besides cancer.

1226
00:52:33.062 --> 00:52:36.022
I'm having it biopsied
on Friday.

1227
00:52:36.065 --> 00:52:38.285
Please. don't worry about it.
Michael. I'm not.

1228
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:41.201
I-I got to go.
I've got to get on the subway.

1229
00:52:41.245 --> 00:52:43.682
-Kit. wait.

1230
00:52:47.773 --> 00:52:49.818
So. Michael.
how was school today?

1231
00:52:51.255 --> 00:52:52.995
It was okay.

1232
00:52:53.039 --> 00:52:55.041
We had to pick teams
in gym class.

1233
00:52:55.084 --> 00:52:56.869
and they picked me last.

1234
00:53:02.614 --> 00:53:03.919
Are you okay. Mom?

1235
00:53:03.963 --> 00:53:05.312
Totally fine.

1236
00:53:07.096 --> 00:53:09.447
I just need to make
an appointment with the doctor.

1237
00:53:12.276 --> 00:53:14.234
Yes. I... Okay. Doctor. Yes.

1238
00:53:14.278 --> 00:53:16.802
Thank you. Doctor.
I'll look at the test results.

1239
00:53:20.066 --> 00:53:23.243
Hey. turd ball. there's
a matter baby on your chair.

1240
00:53:23.287 --> 00:53:25.202
What's a matter baby?

1241
00:53:25.245 --> 00:53:28.030
Nothing. What's the matter
with you. baby?

1242
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:41.174
Confirm your name
and birth date for me. please.

1243
00:53:41.218 --> 00:53:42.697
Christopher Cowan.

1244

Allergies?

1246
00:53:48.094 --> 00:53:50.183
Hot yoga. shareable plates.

1247
00:53:52.751 --> 00:53:54.013
Penicillin.

1248
00:53:59.192 --> 00:54:01.586
And what's your relationship
to the patient?

1249
00:54:04.284 --> 00:54:06.243
The plan is to get in there

1250
00:54:06.286 --> 00:54:08.027
and take a piece of it
and send it off for testing.

1251
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:09.289
There's a chance
that you'll go in.

1252
00:54:09.333 --> 00:54:10.638
you'll find out it's nothing.

1253
00:54:10.682 --> 00:54:11.987
and then we'll just
move on from...

1254
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:13.989
Michael. relax.
Everything's fine.

1255
00:54:14.033 --> 00:54:16.122
I'm gonna be fine. okay?

I'm concerned about Christopher.

1261
00:55:04.562 --> 00:55:06.912
The growth was a lot bigger
than I anticipated.

1262

So it's cancer?

1263
00:55:08.435 --> 00:55:10.002
It's basically...
It's definitely cancer?

We won't know
until the results come back.

apparently the best oncologists
in New York.

1310
00:57:29.358 --> 00:57:30.969

1314

I don't care where we are
right now.

are in Manhattan.

1319
00:57:47.376 --> 00:57:49.727

00:58:00.825 --> 00:58:03.784
-I'm scared. too.
-Mm.

1322
00:58:03.828 --> 00:58:05.786
Generally speaking.
rectal cancer

1323
00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:08.441
is fairly common
and highly treatable.

1324
00:58:08.485 --> 00:58:10.225
Christopher. I was telling
your brother when...

1325
00:58:10.269 --> 00:58:11.400
No. no. no.
I'm not his brother.

1326
00:58:11.444 --> 00:58:12.489
Oh. sorry.

1327
00:58:12.532 --> 00:58:14.708
Uh. there are multiple nodules

1328
00:58:14.752 --> 00:58:17.798
adjacent to the inferior rectum
which are presumably related

1329
00:58:17.842 --> 00:58:20.018
to the neuroendocrine tumor
that was biopsied.

1330
00:58:20.061 --> 00:58:21.541
Well. you sound optimistic.

1331
00:58:21.585 --> 00:58:23.587
There's definitely room
for optimism here.

1332
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:25.632
With a neuroendocrine tumor.

1333
00:58:25.676 --> 00:58:28.505
particularly with what I see
in the pathology report.

1334
00:58:28.548 --> 00:58:30.550
it's very amenable to therapy.

1335
00:58:30.594 --> 00:58:32.334
So this is not one of
the more aggressive ones?

1336
00:58:32.378 --> 00:58:36.208
Correct. Neuroendocrine tumors
are not. uh. aggressive.

1337
00:58:36.251 --> 00:58:38.210
So. take a deep breath.

1338
00:58:38.253 --> 00:58:40.560
MICHAEL:
It was beginning to seem like

1339
00:58:40.604 --> 00:58:43.563
we might dodge a worst-case
cancer diagnosis.

1340
00:58:43.607 --> 00:58:46.392
And as if to seal the deal.
our final doctor looked like

1341
00:58:46.435 --> 00:58:48.481
she stepped straight out
of hair and makeup

1342
00:58:48.525 --> 00:58:50.570
and onto the set of a TV show.

1343
00:58:50.614 --> 00:58:52.006
A good one.

1344
00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:53.530
I was in love with her.

1345
00:58:55.357 --> 00:58:57.359
Until she opened her mouth.

1346
00:58:57.403 --> 00:58:59.187
You have an extremely
aggressive form

1347
00:58:59.231 --> 00:59:00.972
of neuroendocrine cancer.

1348
00:59:02.756 --> 00:59:04.715
Your tumor is what we call
high-grade.

1349
00:59:04.758 --> 00:59:06.194
I'm sorry. what?

1350
00:59:06.238 --> 00:59:08.022
If you decide to get
your treatment here.

1351
00:59:08.066 --> 00:59:09.720
I would like to start
as soon as possible.

1352
00:59:09.763 --> 00:59:11.765
The other doctors
that we talked to.

1353
00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:13.767
they said that this wasn't
the aggressive kind.

1354
00:59:13.811 --> 00:59:15.639
And they're wrong.

1355
00:59:15.682 --> 00:59:18.032
And his is already
at a very advanced stage.

1356
00:59:18.076 --> 00:59:19.686
What stage are we talking?

1357
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:21.383
Stage four.

1358
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:25.170
I'm sorry.

1359
00:59:32.743 --> 00:59:35.920
How soon should he start
treatment?

1360
00:59:35.963 --> 00:59:39.924
DR. LUCAS: Ideally. Monday. uh.
he would start chemotherapy.

1361
00:59:39.967 --> 00:59:42.230
I need a minute.

1362
01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:20.355
This good?

1363
01:00:20.399 --> 01:00:22.183
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1364
01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:36.720
What are you gonna get?

1365
01:00:36.763 --> 01:00:38.809
What I always get.

1366
01:00:40.114 --> 01:00:41.768

01:00:47.252 --> 01:00:48.645
Okay.

1370

-Sure.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.698
Have you talked
to your mom lately?

1374
01:00:58.742 --> 01:00:59.917
No.

1375
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.658
Because she keeps calling me.

1376
01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:03.137
And I'm running out of excuses

1377
01:01:03.181 --> 01:01:05.009
of where you are
and why you can't talk to her.

1378
01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:07.707
And I think
she's getting worried.

1379
01:01:08.752 --> 01:01:10.884
She doesn't even know
we're not living together.

1380
01:01:11.885 --> 01:01:14.192
I think maybe we should
drive down there this weekend.

1381
01:01:15.236 --> 01:01:17.325
I'm not ready to tell them.

1382
01:01:18.326 --> 01:01:19.980
I think we have to.

1383
01:01:29.076 --> 01:01:31.513
I love this song.

1384
01:01:40.871 --> 01:01:42.829
What?

1385
01:01:42.873 --> 01:01:44.526
What?

1386
01:01:45.571 --> 01:01:47.704
You're looking at me.

1387
01:02:57.904 --> 01:03:01.342
♪ Lay me down

1388
01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:05.607
♪ Lay me down

1389
01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:10.047
♪ Lay me down

1390
01:03:11.135 --> 01:03:13.702
♪ Lay me down

1391
01:03:14.703 --> 01:03:17.794
♪ Lay me down

1392
01:03:18.838 --> 01:03:22.233
♪ Lay me down

1393
01:03:23.277 --> 01:03:26.280
♪ Lay me down

1394
01:03:27.325 --> 01:03:30.676
:
♪ Lay me down.

1395
01:03:33.244 --> 01:03:34.941
-Mom.

1396
01:03:34.985 --> 01:03:37.944
Ah!

1397
01:03:37.988 --> 01:03:40.120
-Ah! They're here.
-Hi.

1398
01:03:40.164 --> 01:03:42.035
Oh. hi.

1399
01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:43.558
:
Yay!

1400
01:03:43.602 --> 01:03:45.734
-Hi. Marilyn. Hi.
-Hi. Michael. Hi.

1401
01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:47.562
-It's good to see you.
-Oh. come in. come in. come in.

1402
01:03:47.606 --> 01:03:49.216
-How was the drive?
-Oh. it was good.

1403
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.827
-Yeah. it was fine.
-You know. long as usual.

1404
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:52.089
-but I like making it.
-Ooh. Mom.

1405
01:03:52.132 --> 01:03:53.742
Your hair. it's nice.

1406
01:03:53.786 --> 01:03:55.396
-Oh. it got so gray.
-It's got volume and bounce.

1407
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.876
-It's pretty. Marilyn.
-I don't know. do you think

1408
01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.443
-I should color it?
-No. I love the color.

1409
01:03:58.486 --> 01:03:59.879
It's beautiful.
Something smells delicious.

1410
01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:00.837
-Don't-don't you touch that!
-What... Oh.

1411
01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.881
I'm cooking something.

1412
01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.100
-Wait. Wait.
-Okay.

1413
01:04:03.143 --> 01:04:04.710
Bob! The boys are here!

1414
01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:06.146
-I'm coming!
-Oh. come...

1415
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:07.844
come grab their bags. will you?

1416
01:04:07.887 --> 01:04:09.280
I'm just gonna take the bag.
It's fine.

1417
01:04:09.323 --> 01:04:10.672
You boys must be starving.
Are you starving?

1418
01:04:10.716 --> 01:04:12.022
-I'm okay.
-I can make you snacks.

1419
01:04:12.065 --> 01:04:13.588
No. I was just checking
the fridge.

1420
01:04:13.632 --> 01:04:15.068
We-we got some sandwiches
at the gas station. so...

1421
01:04:15.112 --> 01:04:16.765
-From a gas station?
-They were fine.

1422
01:04:16.809 --> 01:04:18.289
You can't eat sandwiches
that come from a gas station.

1423
01:04:18.332 --> 01:04:19.943
We didn't want to spend
much time in the...

1424
01:04:19.986 --> 01:04:21.901
-It was easy.
-Oh. for... Bob!

1425
01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:23.511
-Come on and get their bags!
-Mom.

1426
01:04:23.555 --> 01:04:24.904
-Come on. They're here.
-I'm coming. Mare!

1427
01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:26.688
He hears you. He's coming.

1428
01:04:26.732 --> 01:04:28.647
Oh. why didn't you just give me
some time to clean up?

1429
01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:30.170
-You call and say you're
on your way. -It's clean.

1430
01:04:30.214 --> 01:04:31.519
You just have to give me
just a little bit

1431
01:04:31.563 --> 01:04:32.912
-of notice. you know.
-It's fine.

1432
01:04:32.956 --> 01:04:34.348
Well. look what
the cat dragged in.

1433
01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:36.524
-Hello. you handsome devil.
-Hey. Dad.

1434
01:04:36.568 --> 01:04:38.048
Hi. Kitty.
How are you? How are you?

1435
01:04:38.091 --> 01:04:39.310
-Good to see you.
-How are you? Good to see you.

1436
01:04:39.353 --> 01:04:40.877
-Hey. Bob.
-Equally handsome devil.

1437
01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.487
-Thank you very much.
That's very kind. -Hello!

1438
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:44.968
-Um. Michael. I love this coat.
-Oh. thank you.

1439
01:04:45.011 --> 01:04:47.144
Is it camel hair?
Because I'm hearing

1440
01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:49.711
that camel hair is-is very...
is big this season.

1441
01:04:49.755 --> 01:04:51.452
-I think it... I think it's...
-Camel hair?!

1442
01:04:51.496 --> 01:04:53.106
You wouldn't know camel hair
from a hole in the ground.

1443
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:54.803
-I have some style.
-What do you mean. camel hair?

1444
01:04:54.847 --> 01:04:56.283
-You do. Bob. You have style.
-Style?

1445
01:04:56.327 --> 01:04:57.806
-Thank you. Michael.
-Look at you. My God.

1446
01:04:57.850 --> 01:04:59.069
-And you wear it well.
-Totally cisgender.

1447
01:04:59.112 --> 01:05:00.548
Dad. let me help you
with those bags.

1448
01:05:00.592 --> 01:05:01.723
The last coat you got
was from JCPenney.

1449
01:05:01.767 --> 01:05:03.421
for goodness' sakes.

1450
01:05:03.464 --> 01:05:05.249
...like. a camera situated
right on the runway.

1451
01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:07.164
-See? You can see there.
A-And you... -MICHAEL: Mm-hmm.

1452
01:05:07.207 --> 01:05:08.992
I mean. you can just
watch planes

1453
01:05:09.035 --> 01:05:10.863
take off and land all day long.

1454
01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:12.734
-Oh. look at that.
-Which he does.

1455
01:05:12.778 --> 01:05:15.085
-Uh. Mare. I do not.
-You do. too.

1456
01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:17.174
Well. I mean.
it is in real time.

1457
01:05:17.217 --> 01:05:20.438
Look. it's. uh...
the little Cessna CTT.

1458
01:05:20.481 --> 01:05:22.657
-Very nice.
-Hold out... Hold out your arm.

1459
01:05:22.701 --> 01:05:25.008
He's not high-style
like a... like a Learjet.

1460
01:05:25.051 --> 01:05:27.010
-Oh. you're knitting me
a sweater. -MICHAEL: Right.

1461
01:05:29.229 --> 01:05:31.275
Last week was this great.
big race in Toledo.

1462
01:05:31.318 --> 01:05:33.973
Which is a really nice town.
I'd never been before.

1463
01:05:34.017 --> 01:05:35.932
It's-it's known
for glass factories.

1464
01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:37.890
but who knows if that's
actually true?

1465
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.153
Listen. you boys should come
one year. It's so much fun.

1466
01:05:40.197 --> 01:05:42.199
Oh. they take over
the whole town. too.

1467
01:05:42.242 --> 01:05:44.027
-We take over the whole town.
-Yeah. It's true.

1468
01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:45.593
-Go ahead. Mare.
-Anyway. this woman I know.

1469
01:05:45.637 --> 01:05:47.117
Trish O'Neil.

1470
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.988
who won the race.
she's in my age-group. but...

1471
01:05:49.032 --> 01:05:51.599
-Wins races all the time.
-So. the race starts.

1472
01:05:51.643 --> 01:05:54.994
I saw her for the first
five miles of the bike ride.

1473
01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:57.736
'cause she and I were riding
fairly close together.

1474
01:05:57.779 --> 01:06:00.173
And then after that.
she just kind of disappears.

1475
01:06:00.217 --> 01:06:02.175
-Oh.
-Huh.

1476
01:06:02.219 --> 01:06:04.047
I don't see her the whole
rest of the race.

1477
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:06.440
Did you like the rosé.
Michael? Is it...

1478
01:06:06.484 --> 01:06:07.876
-Oh. yes. I love this.
-Good.

1479
01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.791
I love all rosé.
but this is very good.

1480
01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:12.707
Last mile of the race--

1481
01:06:12.751 --> 01:06:14.709
da-dum!-- she reappears.

1482
01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:16.842
-She cheated.
-You know. with not one single

1483
01:06:16.885 --> 01:06:18.409
drop of sweat on her.

1484
01:06:18.452 --> 01:06:20.367
she just trots across
the finish line--

1485
01:06:20.411 --> 01:06:21.586
-the winner!
-Yeah.

1486
01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:26.504
And we were all very upset.

1487
01:06:29.115 --> 01:06:30.508
:
So...

1488
01:06:30.551 --> 01:06:32.031
You know what.
we have been talking

1489
01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:33.728
-a blue streak...
-No.

1490
01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:35.208
...ever since
you guys got here.

1491
01:06:35.252 --> 01:06:37.297
-Yeah. so... so...
-Wonderful.

1492
01:06:38.342 --> 01:06:40.561
Honestly. uh. what's going on
with you guys?

1493
01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:44.478
Um...

1494
01:06:49.614 --> 01:06:51.485
Um...

1495
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:53.183
I don't know where to start.

1496
01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:59.319
Uh. about two or three
months ago.

1497
01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:03.106
I started experiencing
a lot of pain

1498
01:07:03.149 --> 01:07:05.151
when going to the bathroom.

1499
01:07:05.195 --> 01:07:07.153
:
And. uh...

1500
01:07:12.202 --> 01:07:14.813
We thought there were
a lot of things it could be.

1501
01:07:14.856 --> 01:07:16.945
How many doctors have you seen?

1502
01:07:16.989 --> 01:07:18.730
We saw three.

1503
01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:21.689
It was the longest
20 minutes of my life.

1504
01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:26.259
I'll never forget how brave
you were telling them.

1505
01:07:34.311 --> 01:07:36.748
Obviously.
you're gonna fight it.

1506
01:07:38.924 --> 01:07:40.795
And you'll beat it.

1507
01:07:43.581 --> 01:07:44.712
Yeah.

1508
01:07:44.756 --> 01:07:46.279
MARILYN:
Who wants cake?

1509
01:07:46.323 --> 01:07:48.238
-It's flourless.
-I'd love cake.

1510
01:07:48.281 --> 01:07:49.935
Here. let me do it.
It's all right.

1511
01:07:49.978 --> 01:07:51.154
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

1512
01:07:51.197 --> 01:07:53.199
I'll just... Okay.

1513
01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:54.896
Here.

1514
01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:13.132
I didn't sleep
one wink last night.

1515
01:08:13.176 --> 01:08:15.178
Not one single wink.

1516
01:08:15.221 --> 01:08:17.528
Everything kept rolling around
in my head.

1517
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:19.530
Just racing around and around.

1518
01:08:19.573 --> 01:08:20.966
MICHAEL:
I felt the same.

1519
01:08:21.009 --> 01:08:22.794
MARILYN:
I kept thinking about Trish.

1520
01:08:22.837 --> 01:08:25.318
Oh. Right.

1521
01:08:25.362 --> 01:08:27.059
I mean. it's just so insulting.

1522
01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.539
-Right.
-Like a...

1523
01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:31.063
like a big middle finger
to the rest of us.

1524
01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.326
I mean. there we are.
pushing ourselves

1525
01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:36.155
as hard as we can.
and-and honestly...

1526
01:08:36.199 --> 01:08:38.375
honestly. for what?

1527
01:08:38.418 --> 01:08:39.593
For what?

1528
01:08:39.637 --> 01:08:40.942
I don't know. For-for what?

1529
01:08:40.986 --> 01:08:43.467
Just to see if we can.

1530
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:45.817
-Oh. sure. Yeah. that.
-If we can do it.

1531
01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:47.427
I mean. there's no glory in it.

1532
01:08:47.471 --> 01:08:49.081
There's certainly
no money in it.

1533
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.952
-It's-it's killing my knees.

1534
01:08:50.996 --> 01:08:52.476
But-but I just do it.

1535
01:08:52.519 --> 01:08:53.825
Well. you should take it easy
on your knees.

1536
01:08:53.868 --> 01:08:55.435
And then someone like Trish
shows up.

1537
01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:57.437
who hasn't got a clue. She...

1538
01:08:57.481 --> 01:08:59.874
Honestly. what race
does she think she's running?

1539
01:08:59.918 --> 01:09:02.181
She thinks she can just bypass
all the hard parts?

1540
01:09:02.225 --> 01:09:05.271
Well. you can't. You have to
run the race in front of you.

1541
01:09:05.315 --> 01:09:07.055
because that's all there is.

1542
01:09:07.099 --> 01:09:08.927
-Marilyn. do you want to...
-You do the best you can.

1543
01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:12.148
But she thinks... she thinks

Hello. What a morning. huh?

1717
01:21:28.622 --> 01:21:30.581
MICHAEL:
Right?

1718
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:35.673
How did you ever
find this place?

1719
01:21:36.674 --> 01:21:38.458
I've been here before.

1720
01:21:38.502 --> 01:21:41.026
My family. we used to take
vacations here

1721
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:42.767
when I was a kid.

1722
01:21:45.248 --> 01:21:47.206
Thank you for inviting us.

1723
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:48.947
Oh. no. no. It was Kit's idea.

1724
01:21:48.991 --> 01:21:51.036
He wanted you here.

1725
01:21:53.691 --> 01:21:56.215
I was vehemently opposed to it.

1726
01:21:56.259 --> 01:21:58.261
-You brat.

1727
01:22:19.151 --> 01:22:21.327
I have a headache.

1728
01:22:21.371 --> 01:22:24.113
We found a number of nodules
on the brain.

1729
01:22:24.156 --> 01:22:26.898
Several of them located
near the brain stem.

1730
01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:29.031
which is likely what's been
causing your headaches.

1731
01:22:31.033 --> 01:22:33.078
How big are they?

1732
01:22:34.732 --> 01:22:37.953
Well. they're small.
but there are a lot of them.

1733
01:22:40.651 --> 01:22:42.696
And your primary tumor
has been growing again.

1734
01:22:43.697 --> 01:22:45.003
How long?

1735
01:22:45.047 --> 01:22:46.178
We don't like to predict
these things.

1736
01:22:46.222 --> 01:22:47.614
Six weeks? Six months?

1737
01:22:49.268 --> 01:22:51.879
More than six weeks.

1738
01:22:51.923 --> 01:22:54.273
I've been feeling
so much better.

1739
01:22:55.796 --> 01:22:58.625
DR. LUCAS: The radiation
bought you some time.

1740
01:22:59.626 --> 01:23:03.239
At this point. all we can do
is address your symptoms

1741
01:23:03.282 --> 01:23:05.545
and manage your pain.

1742
01:23:11.464 --> 01:23:13.423
I'm so sorry. Kit.

1743
01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.879
MICHAEL:
There are still options here.

1744
01:23:34.922 --> 01:23:37.012
There's this targeted treatment.

1745
01:23:37.055 --> 01:23:38.622
It's for N.E.T.'s.

1746
01:23:38.665 --> 01:23:40.319
It's being developed in Germany.

1747
01:23:40.363 --> 01:23:41.973
and I can't remember
what it's called.

1748
01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.322
Michael.

1749
01:23:43.366 --> 01:23:45.237
"Affinator" or "Afinator"
or something.

1750
01:23:45.281 --> 01:23:47.152
-Michael.
-But I just... It blocks...

1751
01:23:47.196 --> 01:23:50.677
I-I think a protein signaling
pathway that's in the-the...

1752
01:23:50.721 --> 01:23:52.549
-It can malfunction...
-Really? Germany?

1753
01:23:52.592 --> 01:23:54.159
...and leads to greater
tumor growth or something.

1754
01:23:54.203 --> 01:23:56.205
I just... I'm telling you
that there are still

1755
01:23:56.248 --> 01:23:58.076
experimental things
going on out there.

1756
01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.947
There was somebody
I read about who's from Italy.

1757
01:23:59.991 --> 01:24:02.515
-Michael. stop. Stop.
-He had a doctor...

1758
01:24:04.343 --> 01:24:06.345
It's everywhere.

1759
01:24:06.389 --> 01:24:08.130
It's in my brain.

1760
01:24:08.173 --> 01:24:10.436
And actually. I'm relieved.

1761
01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.919
I know where I stand now.

1762
01:24:20.446 --> 01:24:21.926
Come on.

1763
01:25:14.065 --> 01:25:15.849
Are you...

1764
01:25:22.073 --> 01:25:24.293
Are you afraid to die?

1765
01:25:26.425 --> 01:25:29.124
I'm afraid of what the end
looks like. but...

1766
01:25:32.257 --> 01:25:34.172
...am I afraid of dying?

1767
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:39.830
No.

1768
01:25:41.788 --> 01:25:43.877
I've had a great life. Mike.

1769
01:25:57.978 --> 01:26:00.198
And I want you to be happy. too.

1770
01:26:01.634 --> 01:26:03.201
That includes meeting someone.

1771
01:26:03.245 --> 01:26:04.855
No. Please don't do... Shh.

1772
01:26:07.988 --> 01:26:09.425
I really appreciate that.

1773
01:26:09.468 --> 01:26:11.557
but I can't talk about that
right now.

1774
01:26:13.516 --> 01:26:14.821
Okay.

1775
01:26:42.719 --> 01:26:45.374
Did you have sex with Sebastian?

1776
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:54.209
Yes.

1777
01:27:00.606 --> 01:27:02.478
I'm sorry I lied to you.

1778
01:27:04.958 --> 01:27:06.743
I'm sorry. too.

1779
01:27:06.786 --> 01:27:08.353
I'm sorry that I made you carry

1780
01:27:08.397 --> 01:27:11.138
so much of my baggage
for so many years

1781
01:27:11.182 --> 01:27:14.098
and making you feel like
the bad guy so many times

1782
01:27:14.141 --> 01:27:16.883
when you didn't deserve to.

1783
01:27:16.927 --> 01:27:19.103
I'm sorry I never told you

1784
01:27:19.146 --> 01:27:21.105
how good your ass looks
in your khaki pants.

1785
01:27:21.148 --> 01:27:23.238
-'Cause it does.

1786
01:27:23.281 --> 01:27:25.240
And I couldn't do it
'cause I was afraid

1787
01:27:25.283 --> 01:27:27.285
if you understood
how beautiful you are

1788
01:27:27.329 --> 01:27:29.069
that you'd leave me.

1789
01:27:32.377 --> 01:27:35.206
And I'm sorry
you're going through this.

1790
01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.254
Thank you.

1791
01:27:42.605 --> 01:27:44.563
I would like to try
some of this pot.

1792
01:27:44.607 --> 01:27:46.913
:
Oh. my God.

1793
01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:51.266
Don't laugh. I'm not kidding.

1794
01:27:55.313 --> 01:27:57.663
If I don't try pot with you...

1795
01:27:58.751 --> 01:28:00.100
Okay.

1796
01:28:00.144 --> 01:28:01.667
:
I can't believe it.

1797
01:28:01.711 --> 01:28:02.886
Okay. take this.

1798
01:28:02.929 --> 01:28:04.322
-I can...
-That's the pot?

1799
01:28:04.366 --> 01:28:05.802
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1800
01:28:12.069 --> 01:28:13.766
-No. Other end. You...
-Oh.

1801
01:28:14.854 --> 01:28:16.987
-Gonna eat it.
-Jesus.

1802
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:18.380
That's right.

1803
01:28:18.423 --> 01:28:19.642

1804
01:28:21.905 --> 01:28:23.254

1805
01:28:27.214 --> 01:28:28.651
-Oh. wow.
-Ooh.

1806
01:28:28.694 --> 01:28:30.087
Oh. God.

1807
01:28:30.130 --> 01:28:31.871
-Have a...
-It hurts.

Take a sip. Take a sip.

1809
01:28:34.178 --> 01:28:35.745
Okay.

1810
01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:40.880
I don't feel it.
It's not working.

1811
01:28:40.924 --> 01:28:43.143
Well. try again.
Have a... Have another hit.

1812
01:28:43.187 --> 01:28:44.536
-Okay.
-You can do it.

1966
01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:54.118
I-I know you're super busy.
but I was wondering

1967
01:39:54.162 --> 01:39:56.338
if you wouldn't mind answering
a-a few quick questions.

1968
01:39:56.381 --> 01:39:57.556
Uh. yeah. Yeah. sure.

-Go ahead.
-Great.

1970

I'd love to stay and talk.
but it looks like

1973
01:40:03.301 --> 01:40:04.737
-I've... I got to...
-Oh. gosh.

1974
01:40:04.781 --> 01:40:06.522
If you don't mind.
I'd really like to get

1975
01:40:06.565 --> 01:40:08.828
your feelings. your thoughts
on a couple of things.

1976
01:40:08.872 --> 01:40:10.178
Hey. Kit.
They're calling for you.

1977
01:40:10.221 --> 01:40:11.831
Please. this won't take long.

1978
01:40:11.875 --> 01:40:14.095

a moment with him.

1979

-Okay? Okay?
-It's okay. It's fine.

1980

-It's fine.
-Okay.

1981
01:40:16.706 --> 01:40:18.447
-Go ahead.
-First question:

1982
01:40:18.490 --> 01:40:22.146
Your character on the show
has been very popular.

1983
01:40:22.190 --> 01:40:24.235
and everyone hates
to see you go.

1984
01:40:24.279 --> 01:40:27.760
so what is next for you?

1985
01:40:27.804 --> 01:40:29.458
I-I-I don't know.

1986
01:40:29.501 --> 01:40:31.851
Um. there are a lot of
possibilities out there. so...

1987
01:40:31.895 --> 01:40:33.462
I don't know what's next
for me. honestly.

1988
01:40:33.505 --> 01:40:35.638
Um... you know. it's strange.

1989
01:40:35.681 --> 01:40:40.077
Uh. everyone will still be here.

1990
01:40:40.121 --> 01:40:44.560
and I'll be gone.

1991
01:40:45.561 --> 01:40:47.563
And how do you feel right now?

1992
01:40:47.606 --> 01:40:49.565
Ooh. Uh. great question.

1993
01:40:51.784 --> 01:40:55.527
I guess I feel like I'll...

1994
01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.356
...miss this.

1995
01:41:01.359 --> 01:41:02.969
I'll miss this a lot.

1996
01:41:03.013 --> 01:41:04.797
Camera's ready.
Kit. we really got to go.

1997
01:41:04.841 --> 01:41:06.756
No. Please. one more second.
Just one more.

1998
01:41:06.799 --> 01:41:08.627
-Just one question.
-Shoot. Go ahead.

1999
01:41:10.542 --> 01:41:13.371
What about me. Kit?

2000
01:41:13.415 --> 01:41:15.460
What should I do next?

2001
01:41:15.504 --> 01:41:16.853
You'll know.

2002
01:41:16.896 --> 01:41:19.116
Okay. we're back in.

2003
01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:21.292

Kit.

2014
01:42:08.383 --> 01:42:10.167
You can go now.

2015
01:42:34.670 --> 01:42:38.413
I was always afraid
Kit would break my heart.

2016
01:42:38.456 --> 01:42:40.545
And eventually. he did.

2017
01:42:40.589 --> 01:42:43.069
But not in the way
I feared he would.

2018
01:42:43.113 --> 01:42:45.202
He broke it open in a way

2019
01:42:45.246 --> 01:42:48.945
that somehow made room
for even more love.

2020
01:42:48.988 --> 01:42:51.948
both to receive and to give.

2021
01:42:51.991 --> 01:42:55.995
And so. I hope that
you'll understand me

2022
01:42:56.039 --> 01:43:00.783
when I say that this ride
with Kit was. to me. a gift.

2023
01:43:01.958 --> 01:43:06.180

01:44:05.804 --> 01:44:08.242
I've never been to Spain.
and I always...

2035

-Yes. Yes.

2038
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:18.164

it looks like a big ship.

Yeah. all the running
stays the same

2046

-Mm.

♪

2050
01:45:10.173 --> 01:45:12.958
The hardest thing
about a story ending

2051
01:45:13.002 --> 01:45:17.485
is that you have to say goodbye
to your favorite characters.

2052
01:45:17.528 --> 01:45:19.530
To your favorite people.

2053
01:45:20.836 --> 01:45:23.099
A good TV show
can make real life

2054
01:45:23.142 --> 01:45:25.319
seem like it makes sense.

2055
01:45:25.362 --> 01:45:28.670
And a good ending can feel like
the end of one thing

2056
01:45:28.713 --> 01:45:30.976
and the beginning of another.

2057
01:45:32.151 --> 01:45:34.850
Sometimes the hero dies.

2058
01:45:34.893 --> 01:45:37.156
Sometimes we only get
14 Christmas trees

2059

2060

reminded me

2061
01:45:44.338 --> 01:45:46.470
