00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:22.761
The impulse to dance
existed long before

4
00:00:22.892 --> 00:00:25.329
our primate ancestors
evolved into humans.

5
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.897
Evolutionary biologists
suggest that dance

6
00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.246
was used by early humans

7
00:00:29.377 --> 00:00:30.900
to promote
the social cooperation

8
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.945
essential for our survival.

9
00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:34.512
Indeed.
studies have found that

10
00:00:34.643 --> 00:00:36.340
today's best dancers all share

11
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:38.386
the two specific genes
associated

12
00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:40.475
with excellent
interpersonal skills.

13
00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:43.521
But despite its power
to save our species.

14
00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:45.045
dance could not save

15
00:00:45.175 --> 00:00:46.916
a small furniture company
in Miami

16
00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:51.007
from the economic tsunami
of a global pandemic.

17
00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:54.837
so like many 40-year-old
Millennial white males.

18
00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:56.621
Mike Lane found himself

19
00:00:56.752 --> 00:01:00.147
alone and adrift in an ocean
of failed relationships

20
00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:01.931
and unrealized dreams.

21
00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.759
Excuse me?
Hello!

22
00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:06.675
This area is off-limits.

23
00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:09.156
Oh. Well. then

24
00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:11.071
you really shouldn't
be here then. should you?

25
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.725
Cute.

26
00:01:13.856 --> 00:01:16.859
Get dressed. start unloading.
Trucks just pulled in.

27
00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:18.078
All right.

28
00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:23.648
So. is she
living in Miami now. or...

29
00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:25.476
Well.
she can't go back to London.

30
00:01:25.607 --> 00:01:27.087
Roger's there.

31
00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:28.914
She has to
go back. for the daughter.

32
00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:30.742
Roger still wants it to work.

33
00:01:30.873 --> 00:01:32.266
according to Bob.

34
00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:33.658
She should have just canceled

35
00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.051
instead of walking around
like a zombie.

36
00:01:35.182 --> 00:01:36.531
Totally.

37
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:38.359
-And here she is.

38
00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:40.012
Hi.

39
00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:41.971
Thank you so much.
This is absolutely beautiful.

40
00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.930
-Oh. thank you
for your contribution.
-You look stunning.

41
00:01:53.678 --> 00:01:55.724
-Scotch. please.
-Neat or rocks?

42
00:01:55.854 --> 00:01:56.986
Neat.

43
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.729
You getting what you want?

44
00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:06.561
With the fundraiser. It looks
like it's going all right.

45
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:09.433
Nobody here knows what the
Big Blue Rescue Project is

46
00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:11.522
and yet they give me
their money every year.

47
00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:13.959
Well. I just think
people like to

48
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.309
look at what they can't have.

49
00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:25.232
I guess.

50
00:02:30.237 --> 00:02:32.064
What's up. bro?
Two vodka sodas.

51
00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:33.718
Two vodka sodas.

52
00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.851
-So. what do you think? Yeah?
-Yeah. Sounds good.

53
00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:40.116
Wait. I know you.
You went to State. right?

54
00:02:40.247 --> 00:02:42.162
State?
No. definitely not.

55
00:02:42.292 --> 00:02:44.729
Huh. We've definitely met.

56
00:02:45.817 --> 00:02:48.211
Uh. no. I don't know. Sorry.

57
00:02:48.342 --> 00:02:53.825
-Don't freak the guy out. hon.
-I'm not.

58
00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:57.089
Holy shit. I got it.
You really don't remember?

59
00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:00.571
I don't know.
Was it at my store? Huh?

60
00:03:00.702 --> 00:03:03.748
No. You were a cop. right?

61
00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:09.624
-What's your name?
-Kim.

62
00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:16.631
Uh. yeah. Like way
back in the day. Yeah.

63
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:18.067
Yeah. Yeah.

64
00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.416
Right. right. right.
Got it.

65
00:03:19.547 --> 00:03:21.636
Nice pull. hon!
Did you arrest her?

66
00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:24.291
Uh. no. I think I let you off
with a warning. Right?

67
00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:26.162
Mm-hmm.
It was my pledge party.

68
00:03:26.293 --> 00:03:28.251
I was being very disorderly.

69
00:03:28.382 --> 00:03:30.384
You being good now?
You behaving?

70
00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:32.081
-Yes. I'm great. actually.
-Good.

71
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:35.867
I'm on Maxandra's legal team
so... here to support.

72
00:03:35.998 --> 00:03:37.956
That's cool. What kind of law
do you practice?

73
00:03:38.087 --> 00:03:41.743
Family Law generally. But.
I do specialize in divorce.

74
00:03:41.873 --> 00:03:43.962
-Well. it was good to see you.
-See you in another 10 years.

75
00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:48.010
-Cheers. Be good.
-I'll do my best.

76
00:04:00.327 --> 00:04:01.980
You!
Bartender.

77
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:04.505
Mrs. Rattigan
would like a word.

78
00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:06.333
Uh. we're not done
breaking down.

79
00:04:06.463 --> 00:04:07.638
Did you hear what I said?

80
00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.336
She'd like
to see you right now.

81
00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:11.816
Bullshit. Hey. look.

82
00:04:11.947 --> 00:04:14.079
you don't have to explain it
to me. All right?

83
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.517
Explain it to Zadie.

84
00:04:16.647 --> 00:04:17.866
Ma'am?

85
00:04:17.996 --> 00:04:20.303
Of course.
I'm super uncomfortable

86
00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:22.653
doing that and I won't do it.

87
00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:26.048
Because that's a date
with chaperones.

88
00:04:26.178 --> 00:04:27.528
I'm not stupid. Roger.

89
00:04:27.658 --> 00:04:29.399
Ma'am. uh.
they said to come see you.

90
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.705
Should I just wait outside?

91
00:04:30.835 --> 00:04:32.533
I don't want to see you!
All right?

92
00:04:32.663 --> 00:04:35.057
Get it into your head.
if you need to talk to me

93
00:04:35.187 --> 00:04:36.667
then bring the lawyers.

94
00:04:37.407 --> 00:04:39.235
Um. bartender?

95
00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:40.671
I'm sorry. They said to come
see you. I didn't mean to--

96
00:04:40.802 --> 00:04:42.238
Yes. yes. please come back.

97
00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:43.892
Okay.

98
00:04:46.634 --> 00:04:48.636
-Yeah?

99
00:04:54.032 --> 00:05:00.256
You know...
Do you like bartending?

100
00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:03.215
Sure. Uh. it's not
really what I do.

101
00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:04.565
but yeah. Why not?

102
00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:06.828
So. what is it
that you really do?

103
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.439
Uh. yeah-- Well.
it's-- That's a long story.

104
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.267
Did you want me for something?

105
00:05:11.398 --> 00:05:13.225
Yeah...

106
00:05:16.577 --> 00:05:18.840
Um. what's your name?

107
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.145
Mike.

108
00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.018
Nice to meet you. Mike.

109
00:05:23.148 --> 00:05:24.324
Nice to meet you.

110
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:29.459
How much?

111
00:05:31.722 --> 00:05:33.550
How much for what?

112
00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:38.773
You know. Please don't make me

113
00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:40.122
spit it out

114
00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:41.166
because this is the first time
I do this

115
00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:44.082
and it's not comfortable.

116
00:05:44.213 --> 00:05:45.345
Look. I don't know

117
00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:46.302
what you're talking about.
What?

118
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.353
But Kim told me that she
knew you. and run into you.

119
00:05:53.483 --> 00:05:54.745
and that you were a dancer.

120
00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:57.313
-Oh. Kim-- Kim told you that?
-Yeah.

121
00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.750
-Right.

122
00:05:59.881 --> 00:06:04.059
Uh. look. I don't really
do that anymore. so--

123
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:05.234
Uh. what was your name?

124
00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.714
Max.

125
00:06:06.844 --> 00:06:09.369
Max. it was nice to meet you.
Uh. thanks for--

126
00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:12.154
I'm s-- I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

127
00:06:12.284 --> 00:06:13.547
No. you didn't offend me.
Don't worry. It's all--

128
00:06:13.677 --> 00:06:15.244
Really. I have no idea
what I'm doing.

129
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.941
It's just I'm not
normally like this...

130
00:06:17.072 --> 00:06:18.726
it's just that I've had
like the shittiest day

131
00:06:18.856 --> 00:06:20.292
and the shittiest week...

132
00:06:20.423 --> 00:06:21.511
and the shittiest month.
and the shittiest year.

133
00:06:21.642 --> 00:06:23.121
Same here.
Welcome to the club.

134
00:06:23.252 --> 00:06:25.080
Don't worry.
you didn't offend me.

135
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.168
Okay.

136
00:06:28.475 --> 00:06:30.172
It was nice
to meet you.

137
00:06:30.302 --> 00:06:32.783
So. let's say...

138
00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:37.266
if you were to do this just.
like. one last time.

139
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.572
Mm-hmm?

140
00:06:38.702 --> 00:06:40.791
How much would something
like that go for?

141
00:06:40.922 --> 00:06:42.053
How much would something

142
00:06:42.184 --> 00:06:44.491
like that go for?

143
00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:47.624
Uh. $60.000? Maybe.

144
00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:50.497
-$60.000?
-Yeah. Yeah. 60.

145
00:06:50.627 --> 00:06:52.194
Let's call it 60.

146
00:06:52.324 --> 00:06:55.066
What the fuck do you do?
She said it was a silly dance.

147
00:06:55.197 --> 00:06:58.200
Who said that? Kim?
Kim said that? It was silly?

148
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.637
Yeah. She said
it was a silly dance.

149
00:07:00.768 --> 00:07:03.118
but that it would
get my mind off of things.

150
00:07:03.248 --> 00:07:06.991
And if she's right.
I'm willing to pay six.

151
00:07:09.254 --> 00:07:10.995
What?
You're serious right now?

152
00:07:11.126 --> 00:07:12.954
You're gonna pay me $6.000
to give you a dance?

153
00:07:15.043 --> 00:07:17.175
Yeah. but no happy endings.
huh?

154
00:07:18.742 --> 00:07:20.135
So we have a deal?

155
00:07:29.536 --> 00:07:31.407
Are you leaving?

156
00:07:32.843 --> 00:07:34.932
You know I have security.

157
00:07:35.063 --> 00:07:36.020
Mm-hmm.

158
00:07:37.544 --> 00:07:39.459
What are you doing?

159
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:42.897
Um. you seem like
you need a drink.

160
00:07:44.551 --> 00:07:47.205
I really. really do.

161
00:08:02.307 --> 00:08:04.614
Why are you moving my flowers?

162
00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:07.008
These will work better here.

163
00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:09.880
You have a really. really.

164
00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:11.403
really nice house.

165
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.494
Thank you.

166
00:08:14.624 --> 00:08:16.017
Everything's made really well.

167
00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:26.462
Are you redecorating?

168
00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:29.770
Maybe. Do you have music?

169
00:08:32.947 --> 00:08:34.731
You might want to
finish your drink.

170
00:08:48.092 --> 00:08:51.618
So. I don't know if you
really know what you bought...

171
00:08:51.748 --> 00:08:55.970
but I'm gonna give it
to you anyway.

172
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.668
And at any point I take you
past your comfort zone--

173
00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:00.540
I fucking slap you.

174
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.804
You can slap me.
That's perfect.

175
00:09:05.327 --> 00:09:06.328
May I touch you?

176
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:09.549
I guess.

177
00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:41.429
Thanks.

178
00:13:42.473 --> 00:13:44.388
You don't know what I said.

179
00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:45.955
What are you talking about?
Yeah. I do.

180
00:13:46.782 --> 00:13:48.740
What did I say?

181
00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:50.612
You said I move like water.

182
00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:56.836
I didn't mean for you to
understand that.

183
00:13:56.966 --> 00:13:59.360
Well. maybe you should be

184
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.927
a little more careful
what you say.

185
00:14:01.057 --> 00:14:03.190
Remember. I am from Florida.

186
00:14:08.978 --> 00:14:11.894
If I had known what this night
was going to be like...

187
00:14:13.504 --> 00:14:16.594
I would have gladly paid you
the 60 thousand.

188
00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:19.641
It wouldn't have
mattered anyway.

189
00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:21.251
I'm not gonna take your money.

190
00:14:21.382 --> 00:14:24.298
I'm not even gonna take
the six grand.

191
00:14:31.609 --> 00:14:33.220
Who are you?

192
00:14:35.787 --> 00:14:38.834
Um. I don't know.

193
00:14:40.401 --> 00:14:41.445
What do you mean?

194
00:14:45.275 --> 00:14:46.624
Come with me to London.

195
00:14:48.713 --> 00:14:50.063
What's in London?

196
00:14:50.193 --> 00:14:52.456
My life.

197
00:14:52.587 --> 00:14:55.633
Your life's in London?
I thought this was your house.

198
00:14:55.764 --> 00:14:59.028
This is a house.
but it's not  the house.

199
00:15:01.248 --> 00:15:03.859
Max. I can't just
go to London.

200
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.730
I got. like.
stuff here. I got--

201
00:15:05.861 --> 00:15:07.819
Like there's a whole mess.
I got a job.

202
00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.734
I can't just go to London.

203
00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:12.520
I'm gonna get you
a much better job in London.

204
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:13.869
You're gonna get--

205
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.045
No. well. I have a job
for you in mind.

206
00:15:16.176 --> 00:15:19.919
It's creative.
And all you have to do

207
00:15:20.049 --> 00:15:21.355
is come with me for a month

208
00:15:21.485 --> 00:15:24.967
and I will give you
your 60 thousand.

209
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.884
Max. I can't just up and leave
my entire life here for you--

210
00:15:29.015 --> 00:15:30.364
Yes. you can. Yes. you can.
Listen. Listen.

211
00:15:30.494 --> 00:15:32.192
Not for a mon-- I can't.
Not for a whole month.

212
00:15:32.322 --> 00:15:33.976
You should come with me

213
00:15:34.107 --> 00:15:36.370
and then if it's out of your
comfort zone then you just--

214
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.720
-I get to fucking slap you?
-You can fucking slap me.

215
00:15:41.114 --> 00:15:42.115
Let's go.

216
00:15:47.033 --> 00:15:47.990
Thank you.

217
00:15:55.215 --> 00:15:56.694
What are you doing?

218
00:15:56.825 --> 00:15:58.958
I don't really
fuck with vegetables.

219
00:16:00.176 --> 00:16:02.700
How do you
have that body then?

220
00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:06.095
I don't know. Genetics.
Mom and Pops.

221
00:16:06.226 --> 00:16:08.271
How'd you get so rich?

222
00:16:09.577 --> 00:16:12.972
-Genetics. I guess.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah?

223
00:16:13.102 --> 00:16:15.713
No. Roger's family
is in media.

224
00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:18.673
Oh. that's cool.
Is that like TV and shit?

225
00:16:18.803 --> 00:16:21.328
It's more like
everything and shit.

226
00:16:21.458 --> 00:16:23.156
Right.

227
00:16:23.286 --> 00:16:26.855
So. um. I don't know.
What happened. with that?

228
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.380
Marriage happened.

229
00:16:31.338 --> 00:16:32.339
Mmm.

230
00:16:32.469 --> 00:16:34.167
Are you married?

231
00:16:34.297 --> 00:16:38.780
Am I married? Um. would it
be a problem if I was?

232
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.914
No. This is
100 percent business.

233
00:16:43.045 --> 00:16:46.135
Right. You keep talking
about this "job."

234
00:16:46.266 --> 00:16:48.485
But you always leave out
what the actual job is.

235
00:16:48.616 --> 00:16:51.227
It's what you were meant
to be doing all along.

236
00:16:52.837 --> 00:16:55.057
Okay. I've made it
really clear though.

237
00:16:55.188 --> 00:16:57.146
I'm not--
I don't dance anymore.

238
00:16:57.277 --> 00:17:00.889
Then I can claim that I got
Magic Mike's Last Dance.

239
00:17:03.674 --> 00:17:06.025
So what else could you
possibly be paying me for?

240
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:10.377
We are not having sex.

241
00:17:10.507 --> 00:17:12.161
Completely
out of the question.

242
00:17:13.684 --> 00:17:15.121
Why?

243
00:17:15.251 --> 00:17:17.079
You know. Mike.
I actually think you have...

244
00:17:18.994 --> 00:17:21.649
other talents. And this is
what I'm invested in.

245
00:17:21.779 --> 00:17:23.912
Okay. But just. you know.
hear me out.

246
00:17:26.306 --> 00:17:30.527
You've purchased me for
a month. um. let's just say...

247
00:17:30.658 --> 00:17:33.008
you say. "Jump."
I say. "Which bed?"

248
00:17:33.139 --> 00:17:35.141
Look. last night was...

249
00:17:36.577 --> 00:17:40.624
kind of magical.
It was amazing.

250
00:17:40.755 --> 00:17:44.280
So. let's not fuck that up.

251
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:47.066
Okay?

252
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.242
Okay.

253
00:17:49.372 --> 00:17:52.071
Uh. and no.
I'm not. by the way.

254
00:17:53.115 --> 00:17:54.203
What?

255
00:17:54.334 --> 00:17:55.509
Married.

256
00:17:59.208 --> 00:18:03.299
Okay. Are you
in a relationship?

257
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.084
Mm-mm. No.

258
00:18:05.214 --> 00:18:06.476
Me and relationships

259
00:18:06.607 --> 00:18:08.478
don't have a tendency
to. uh. work out.

260
00:18:11.786 --> 00:18:13.440
Yeah. I can understand that.

261
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.529
-To freedom.
-To freedom.

262
00:19:01.444 --> 00:19:05.187
Now. sir. the brown hamper
is for dry cleaning

263
00:19:05.318 --> 00:19:07.885
and the beige hamper
is for regular laundry.

264
00:19:08.016 --> 00:19:10.540
Uh. I'm probably
not gonna have

265
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:11.889
any dry cleaning and I.
by the way

266
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.239
I can do my own clothes. man.

267
00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:14.631
Just show me
where the machines are.

268
00:19:14.762 --> 00:19:16.807
Ms. Mendoza would
never allow that. sir.

269
00:19:16.938 --> 00:19:18.635
Aw. man. you can call me Mike.
It's all good.

270
00:19:18.766 --> 00:19:21.421
As you wish. sir. The loo
is through this door here.

271
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:25.164
Uh. the toilet. sir.

272
00:19:25.294 --> 00:19:26.469
Right.
Do you have any idea

273
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.079
what the fuck I'm doing here?

274
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.691
Uh. regrettably... no. sir.

275
00:19:30.821 --> 00:19:31.996
Yeah. but you wouldn't tell me

276
00:19:32.127 --> 00:19:33.476
even if you did know.
would you?

277
00:19:33.607 --> 00:19:36.131
I would be lying
if I said I wasn't lying. sir.

278
00:19:36.262 --> 00:19:37.306
Right.
It's Mike. man.

279
00:19:37.437 --> 00:19:38.960
Just call me Mike.

280
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.355
Well. "Mike." Ms. Mendoza
does love a good surprise.

281
00:19:42.485 --> 00:19:45.314
I'll collect you at half past.

282
00:19:45.445 --> 00:19:47.882
Collect me at half past
for the surprise. Cool.

283
00:19:53.888 --> 00:19:56.064
Shit.

284
00:20:00.677 --> 00:20:02.288
I never like
to give credit to Victor

285
00:20:02.418 --> 00:20:04.986
because he becomes
unbearable...

286
00:20:05.116 --> 00:20:07.510
but I wouldn't own the place
that we're going to

287
00:20:07.641 --> 00:20:09.077
if he hadn't convinced me

288
00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.035
to fight for it
in the settlement.

289
00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:12.341
Her only other option

290
00:20:12.472 --> 00:20:15.518
was a sand and gravel pit
in High Wycombe.

291
00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:20.393
And the only value I saw in it
was that my mother-in-law...

292
00:20:20.523 --> 00:20:22.003
didn't want to give it away.

293
00:20:22.133 --> 00:20:25.354
But now.
I have found its purpose.

294
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.229
What's my purpose there?
If we're going there.

295
00:20:31.012 --> 00:20:33.232
Well...

296
00:20:33.362 --> 00:20:35.234
just pretend
that today is Christmas

297
00:20:35.364 --> 00:20:37.758
and you're about to open
your presents.

298
00:20:37.888 --> 00:20:39.238
Okay.

299
00:20:39.368 --> 00:20:42.066
As a matter of fact. Victor.

300
00:20:42.197 --> 00:20:43.938
I think we should stop
at Liberty's first.

301
00:20:44.068 --> 00:20:45.069
Don't you think?

302
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.854
I would let Harj know.

303
00:20:46.984 --> 00:20:48.377
so that he can
mentally prepare.

304
00:20:48.508 --> 00:20:49.857
Good idea.

305
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:52.076
What's a Harj?

306
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.697
Hello. Harj.

307
00:21:03.827 --> 00:21:06.874
Good afternoon.
Madame Rattigan!

308
00:21:07.004 --> 00:21:09.485
Don't you "madame" me
and it's Mendoza now.

309
00:21:11.444 --> 00:21:14.795
So where's
"the big tear-down"?

310
00:21:14.925 --> 00:21:17.406
What--
This does not cost that.

311
00:21:17.537 --> 00:21:18.973
What is this in dollars?

312
00:21:19.103 --> 00:21:20.409
Do you like--
What. do you drop a zero or...

313
00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:22.672
So cute.

314
00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:31.551
Do you know what Victor does?

315
00:21:31.681 --> 00:21:33.204
So you own this place?

316
00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:34.989
I do now.

317
00:21:35.119 --> 00:21:38.079
When this very same play
opened in 2004.

318
00:21:38.209 --> 00:21:39.994
the owner of the theater

319
00:21:40.124 --> 00:21:43.302
fell madly in love with this
horribly insecure actress.

320
00:21:43.432 --> 00:21:45.478
And so...

321
00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:48.132
here's where my love story
with Roger began

322
00:21:48.263 --> 00:21:50.178
and here is where
it's going to end.

323
00:21:51.484 --> 00:21:53.094
He must have loved
your performance.

324
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.879
I had three lines.

325
00:22:02.103 --> 00:22:05.106
Well. you certainly
look the part.

326
00:22:05.236 --> 00:22:08.196
So relax. have fun

327
00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:10.851
and I promise there won't be
any more surprises.

328
00:22:10.981 --> 00:22:12.069
but you're gonna like
this one.

329
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.157
You swear?

330
00:22:14.507 --> 00:22:15.812
Deal.

331
00:22:15.943 --> 00:22:18.032
Miss Mendoza!
Right on time as usual.

332
00:22:18.162 --> 00:22:19.860
Stop it. Woody.
I'm half an hour late.

333
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.644
As usual. Is this. uh--

334
00:22:21.775 --> 00:22:23.211
Yeah. Mike. meet Woody.

335
00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:25.082
the best stage manager
in all of London.

336
00:22:25.213 --> 00:22:27.694
Easy. I'm just here to serve
your vision. gov.

337
00:22:28.825 --> 00:22:30.566
My vision?

338
00:22:30.697 --> 00:22:34.396
Mm-hmm. Your vision. Let's go.

339
00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:37.312
Oh. fuck.

340
00:22:38.705 --> 00:22:39.793
Voilà.

341
00:22:40.533 --> 00:22:41.577
Wow.

342
00:22:41.708 --> 00:22:42.883
Right on time.

343
00:22:49.498 --> 00:22:51.195
Listen. I-- Hugh.

344
00:22:51.326 --> 00:22:54.373
are we actually going again
because I'm not sure.

345
00:22:54.503 --> 00:22:55.765
But if you go back
to the start of the scene

346
00:22:55.896 --> 00:22:57.071
please just go
to the top of the scene

347
00:22:57.201 --> 00:22:58.377
and imbue it
with a little more--

348
00:22:58.507 --> 00:22:59.508
So what's this
shit about?

349
00:22:59.639 --> 00:23:01.031
It's the same old

350
00:23:01.162 --> 00:23:03.164
will-she-marry-for-love
or-money bullshit.

351
00:23:03.294 --> 00:23:05.079
Hmm.

352
00:23:05.209 --> 00:23:07.081
So. what does she pick?
Love or money?

353
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:08.691
Who cares?

354
00:23:08.822 --> 00:23:10.693
The real question is:

355
00:23:10.824 --> 00:23:12.521
why does she feel like
she has to choose?

356
00:23:12.652 --> 00:23:14.001
I think
I've run out of words.

357
00:23:14.131 --> 00:23:15.394
Hell yeah.

358
00:23:15.524 --> 00:23:16.786
Well. this is your joint.
right?

359
00:23:16.917 --> 00:23:18.179
Why don't you just
give them that note?

360
00:23:18.309 --> 00:23:19.267
Show me.

361
00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:20.703
have you got the script or--

362
00:23:20.834 --> 00:23:21.704
Jessica.
do you have a script?

363
00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:25.621
Oh. this is a jolly good

364
00:23:25.752 --> 00:23:26.840
waste of time. isn't it?

365
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.798
Bravo!
Bravo. everybody.

366
00:23:28.929 --> 00:23:31.322
Absolutely flawless.
thank you.

367
00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:32.976
Excuse me?
Who the fuck is talking?

368
00:23:33.107 --> 00:23:36.153
Oh. Maxandra.
My sincere apologies.

369
00:23:36.284 --> 00:23:38.155
I couldn't see you
in the light.

370
00:23:38.286 --> 00:23:40.157
Nice to see you again. uh...

371
00:23:41.245 --> 00:23:43.204
-Matthew.
-Right.

372
00:23:43.334 --> 00:23:45.641
-The director.
-Of course.

373
00:23:45.772 --> 00:23:47.382
To what
do we owe the pleasure?

374
00:23:47.513 --> 00:23:48.905
I'm here to make
an announcement.

375
00:23:49.036 --> 00:23:51.604
Oh! Oh. Tell me.

376
00:23:51.734 --> 00:23:53.083
Well. if I only told you

377
00:23:53.214 --> 00:23:55.303
it wouldn't be
an announcement. would it?

378
00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:58.349
I suppose not.
Um. attention. everyone!

379
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.613
Gang.
this is Maxandra Rattigan.

380
00:24:00.743 --> 00:24:02.136
The wife of our owner and--

381
00:24:02.266 --> 00:24:05.444
Actually.
it's Maxandra Mendoza

382
00:24:05.574 --> 00:24:07.924
and I'm the legal owner
of this theater.

383
00:24:10.492 --> 00:24:13.321
I am here
to give you all notice

384
00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:15.802
Isabel Ascendant is closed...

385
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.326
effective immediately.

386
00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:19.545
On what fucking grounds?

387
00:24:19.675 --> 00:24:21.198
We are at capacity
every night!

388
00:24:21.329 --> 00:24:25.638
Relax. It's only a four-week
course correction.

389
00:24:25.768 --> 00:24:30.120
An evolution. A revelation!

390
00:24:31.774 --> 00:24:34.168
And no one is fired.

391
00:24:34.298 --> 00:24:35.561
Christ.

392
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:37.476
Except for. um...

393
00:24:39.347 --> 00:24:41.784
-Matthew.
-Matthew. Yes.

394
00:24:41.915 --> 00:24:44.221
Matthew will be replaced

395
00:24:44.352 --> 00:24:46.920
by a brilliant
new choreographer

396
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.184
that I recently
discovered in Miami.

397
00:24:50.314 --> 00:24:53.274
His artistry
made me feel. uh...

398
00:24:56.364 --> 00:24:59.193
There are
no words. It's just...

399
00:25:00.063 --> 00:25:01.064
ecstasy.

400
00:25:01.978 --> 00:25:04.111
And in exactly one month.

401
00:25:04.241 --> 00:25:08.463
I want every woman that
walks into this theater

402
00:25:08.594 --> 00:25:11.814
to feel the same kind
of ecstasy that I did.

403
00:25:11.945 --> 00:25:16.471
To transcend. To break free.

404
00:25:16.602 --> 00:25:18.342
So. without further ado...

405
00:25:18.473 --> 00:25:22.259
I give you
the visionary artist...

406
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:26.133
that inspired me
so profoundly

407
00:25:26.263 --> 00:25:29.049
and that will take us
to the promised land.

408
00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:31.225
Ladies and gentlemen...

409
00:25:31.355 --> 00:25:33.706
Michael Jeffrey Lane.

410
00:25:43.063 --> 00:25:44.586
'Sup?

411
00:25:44.717 --> 00:25:48.503
The look on Roger's face
when he sees this!

412
00:25:48.634 --> 00:25:51.419
It's worth every pound.
every shilling.

413
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.638
No. Yeah.
You could've given me

414
00:25:52.768 --> 00:25:54.291
just a little
heads-up before

415
00:25:54.422 --> 00:25:55.728
you threw me
to the wolves in there!

416
00:25:55.858 --> 00:25:57.120
You would've been
in your head.

417
00:25:57.251 --> 00:25:58.469
over-thinking everything.

418
00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.688
It was better
than not thinking

419
00:25:59.819 --> 00:26:00.907
anything at all. Like--

420
00:26:01.037 --> 00:26:02.648
And what are you
so excited about?

421
00:26:02.778 --> 00:26:04.127
Like every single person
in there quit!

422
00:26:04.258 --> 00:26:07.130
We don't need actors.
we need dancers.

423
00:26:07.261 --> 00:26:09.176
Plus. by not firing them.

424
00:26:09.306 --> 00:26:11.613
we saved thousands
on labor-union fees.

425
00:26:11.744 --> 00:26:13.876
-More money for you.

426
00:26:14.007 --> 00:26:17.488
Yeah. but-- Okay. I--
Look. no offense...

427
00:26:17.619 --> 00:26:18.925
but there's got to be
easier ways

428
00:26:19.055 --> 00:26:20.666
to get back
at your husband for...

429
00:26:20.796 --> 00:26:23.016
I don't know. whatever.
than putting on a strip show.

430
00:26:23.146 --> 00:26:26.802
Oh. I'm not a scorned woman.
and this is not a strip show.

431
00:26:26.933 --> 00:26:29.239
We are bringing
the tsunami to London!

432
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.198
Okay.
All right. This--

433
00:26:31.328 --> 00:26:32.416
And I'm down for that.

434
00:26:32.547 --> 00:26:33.592
I just think that
you haven't--

435
00:26:33.722 --> 00:26:35.202
Can't you see?
People are numb.

436
00:26:35.332 --> 00:26:37.552
disconnected. desensitized.

437
00:26:37.683 --> 00:26:39.641
We're going to wake them up

438
00:26:39.772 --> 00:26:43.036
with a wave of passion
they've never felt before.

439
00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:45.778
Okay. I just--
There's one little thing

440
00:26:45.908 --> 00:26:47.344
that I think you're forgetting

441
00:26:47.475 --> 00:26:49.608
is that I don't know shit
about directing theater.

442
00:26:49.738 --> 00:26:51.435
-And that's why you have me!
-What?

443
00:26:51.566 --> 00:26:53.176
It will be a historical.

444
00:26:53.307 --> 00:26:56.702
one-night collaboration
between the stage. and the...

445
00:26:56.832 --> 00:26:58.660
-The thongs?
-Eh. I don't know.

446
00:26:58.791 --> 00:27:00.749
-Exactly. That's what--
-Who the hell are you?

447
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.185
I don't know. Who are you?

448
00:27:02.316 --> 00:27:04.623
Zadie.
what are you doing here?

449
00:27:04.753 --> 00:27:06.537
Um. this is my daughter.
Zadie.

450
00:27:06.668 --> 00:27:09.497
Oh. shit. Hi.
Nice to meet you!

451
00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:11.978
-We had a meeting. Maxandra.
-Yeah.

452
00:27:12.108 --> 00:27:14.633
Oh. my God. I'm so sorry.

453
00:27:14.763 --> 00:27:16.765
I completely
lost track of time.

454
00:27:16.896 --> 00:27:18.811
Completely. I'm so sorry.

455
00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:20.334
I can see that.
I'm more interested

456
00:27:20.464 --> 00:27:22.815
in why you lost track of time.

457
00:27:22.945 --> 00:27:25.992
Well. um. I've been
handling some business

458
00:27:26.122 --> 00:27:28.037
with the new director
of  Isabel Ascendant.

459
00:27:28.168 --> 00:27:29.604
-Mm-hmm.
-Michael Jeffrey Lane.

460
00:27:29.735 --> 00:27:32.433
Ah. yeah. That's not my name.
But-- It's just--

461
00:27:32.563 --> 00:27:33.652
But it's got gravitas.

462
00:27:33.782 --> 00:27:35.218
Yeah. it's just--
It's Mike Lane.

463
00:27:35.349 --> 00:27:36.437
But you do need a stage name.

464
00:27:36.567 --> 00:27:38.744
-Are you two hooking up?
-Zadie!

465
00:27:38.874 --> 00:27:40.354
Well. I-- What's funny
about that is. uh...

466
00:27:40.484 --> 00:27:42.530
your mom actually
is paying me to not hook up.

467
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:45.359
We are not hooking up.

468
00:27:45.489 --> 00:27:48.057
But he will be
staying at the house

469
00:27:48.188 --> 00:27:50.146
just until he gets settled.
Okay?

470
00:27:50.277 --> 00:27:51.844
How convenient.

471
00:27:51.974 --> 00:27:53.802
Tell me. Mike. what do you
plan to do with Act Three?

472
00:27:53.933 --> 00:27:56.762
Yeah. we're gonna have one.

473
00:27:56.892 --> 00:28:00.766
I was pl-- I was. uh. planning
on doing Act Three like a--

474
00:28:00.896 --> 00:28:02.289
Everybody knows

475
00:28:02.419 --> 00:28:04.030
Isabel Ascendant
has a wildly outdated.

476
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.118
painfully misogynistic climax.

477
00:28:05.248 --> 00:28:06.336
Mm-hmm.

478
00:28:06.467 --> 00:28:08.512
Exactly.
And that's why our take

479
00:28:08.643 --> 00:28:10.340
is going to be so exciting

480
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:11.864
because they will be
expecting that

481
00:28:11.994 --> 00:28:13.692
and instead.
they're gonna see

482
00:28:13.822 --> 00:28:14.910
that a woman can have
whatever she wants.

483
00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:16.869
-whenever she wants it.
-Mm-hmm.

484
00:28:16.999 --> 00:28:19.132
Since when do you
believe that?

485
00:28:19.262 --> 00:28:21.177
Since Mike and I have
been exploring this theme.

486
00:28:21.308 --> 00:28:25.965
Yeah. your m-- Yeah. we've
been exploring those themes.

487
00:28:26.095 --> 00:28:29.011
You're in another one
of your phases. aren't you?

488
00:28:29.142 --> 00:28:32.623
Baby. don't you have some
schoolwork to do?

489
00:28:32.754 --> 00:28:35.017
Uh. what's the phases thing?

490
00:28:35.148 --> 00:28:37.628
Every few years
she starts a big new project.

491
00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:39.935
Sometimes it's a charity.
a documentary.

492
00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:41.763
-a new best friend.
-Right.

493
00:28:41.894 --> 00:28:44.070
Each time it's like
she's a new person.

494
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.462
So what?

495
00:28:45.593 --> 00:28:47.464
Sue me for exploring myself

496
00:28:47.595 --> 00:28:50.467
and my contributions
to the world!

497
00:28:50.598 --> 00:28:52.687
But your contributions
never see the light of day.

498
00:28:52.818 --> 00:28:54.428
There's always some obstacle.

499
00:28:54.558 --> 00:28:56.038
We call her
The Queen of the First Act.

500
00:28:56.169 --> 00:28:58.084
Our therapist.
whom she stood up to be here.

501
00:28:58.214 --> 00:28:59.781
says she tries on these new

502
00:28:59.912 --> 00:29:02.001
personas as a way from running
from the guilt about--

503
00:29:02.131 --> 00:29:03.611
I already said how sorry I am

504
00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:04.917
about missing
that appointment

505
00:29:05.047 --> 00:29:07.223
and I am going
to reschedule it.

506
00:29:28.027 --> 00:29:30.116
Uh. you know.
pardon my French.

507
00:29:30.246 --> 00:29:32.858
but. uh. y'all are being
rude as fuck.

508
00:29:32.988 --> 00:29:33.989
Sorry.

509
00:29:37.384 --> 00:29:40.387
-Pleasure. Zadie.
-Zadie. wait. don't go.

510
00:29:40.517 --> 00:29:43.129
You want some cake? Baby.

511
00:29:47.437 --> 00:29:48.438
What's going on?

512
00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.837
No. I didn't know
until you sent it.

513
00:29:55.968 --> 00:29:57.708
Well. technically.
she does have the right.

514
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.713
I have no idea.
Maybe Zadie will tell me.

515
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.456
Change the agreement how?

516
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.895
Mother-- Mother. I think

517
00:30:10.025 --> 00:30:12.114
you should pursue this
on your own.

518
00:30:12.245 --> 00:30:13.899
I can't get dragged
into a fight.

519
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:15.639
Not about this.
not right now.

520
00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:17.903
Yo!

521
00:30:18.033 --> 00:30:21.210
Holy shit! Naysayers.
we have proof of life!

522
00:30:21.341 --> 00:30:22.777
All right.

523
00:30:22.908 --> 00:30:25.519
What's up. man?
I know. look. I know. I-I--

524
00:30:25.649 --> 00:30:28.043
And I'm sorry. okay. I know
I've been ducking you all.

525
00:30:28.174 --> 00:30:29.958
Uh. I apologize. I just--

526
00:30:30.089 --> 00:30:32.178
It's a long story.
but I'm in London

527
00:30:32.308 --> 00:30:33.483
and I just want you guys
to know

528
00:30:33.614 --> 00:30:34.833
I'm gonna be able
to pay you back.

529
00:30:34.963 --> 00:30:36.443
I just need a few weeks. Okay?

530
00:30:36.573 --> 00:30:37.836
Oh. come on. man!

531
00:30:37.966 --> 00:30:39.533
How many times
do we have to tell you

532
00:30:39.663 --> 00:30:42.666
you don't need to pay us back!
It was an investment.

533
00:30:42.797 --> 00:30:44.016
I know. I know. But I'm--

534
00:30:44.146 --> 00:30:45.452
As many times
as you guys say that.

535
00:30:45.582 --> 00:30:46.627
I'm not just gonna burn
my friends' money

536
00:30:46.757 --> 00:30:48.281
and not care. All right?
I don't--

537
00:30:48.411 --> 00:30:51.980
No. Money is water. Mike.
It flows in both directions.

538
00:30:52.111 --> 00:30:53.939
That's a good point.
but still.

539
00:30:54.069 --> 00:30:57.594
You-- Yeah. hold up.
You buried the lede here.

540
00:30:57.725 --> 00:31:00.032
Why are you in London?

541
00:31:00.162 --> 00:31:03.339
I don't know. short story
is that...

542
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:07.256
I was bartending at. uh.
this charity event

543
00:31:07.387 --> 00:31:08.736
and then
at the end of the night

544
00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:10.825
I ended up giving
this rich lady a lap dance

545
00:31:10.956 --> 00:31:12.566
and now I'm living
in her house in London

546
00:31:12.696 --> 00:31:14.046
and gonna put on a show

547
00:31:14.176 --> 00:31:16.483
at this famous theater
that she owns. So. yeah.

548
00:31:16.613 --> 00:31:18.702
Cool. Hey. sex work

549
00:31:18.833 --> 00:31:20.704
is nothing to be
embarrassed about. Mikey.

550
00:31:20.835 --> 00:31:22.924
Especially when
it's the live-in kind.

551
00:31:23.055 --> 00:31:25.405
Hey. look. thanks. Tarzan.

552
00:31:25.535 --> 00:31:26.667
Look. I basically
am just saying

553
00:31:26.797 --> 00:31:27.929
though I'm gonna
have your money...

554
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.975
I don't exactly know. uh.

555
00:31:30.105 --> 00:31:32.542
what I said yes to
so I hope it works out.

556
00:31:32.673 --> 00:31:35.197
Mikey. Mikey.
this is great news.

557
00:31:35.328 --> 00:31:37.330
I was looking
at your chart last night...

558
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.592
you know you're in a once-

559
00:31:38.722 --> 00:31:41.769
in-33-year Jupiter cycle.
right?

560
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.947
I-- No. I didn't. but that
explains a lot I guess. Yeah.

561
00:31:46.078 --> 00:31:48.907
Yeah. it does. so whatever
existential confusion

562
00:31:49.037 --> 00:31:50.038
you're feeling right now.

563
00:31:50.169 --> 00:31:51.822
it's an initiation.

564
00:31:51.953 --> 00:31:55.087
It's wiping the slate clean
for you to self-actualize.

565
00:31:55.217 --> 00:31:58.742
Uh. I'm just trying
to survive to be honest.

566
00:31:58.873 --> 00:32:01.397
Surviving?
Bro. you are a gig worker.

567
00:32:01.528 --> 00:32:03.747
Magic Mike's coming back
to the main stage.

568
00:32:03.878 --> 00:32:05.575
I-- But that's the thing
I'm not even dancing though.

569
00:32:05.706 --> 00:32:06.925
I'm putting on the show.

570
00:32:07.055 --> 00:32:08.927
I guess I'm directing
or whatever.

571
00:32:09.057 --> 00:32:10.929
I mean. it's--
I'm only here for a month.

572
00:32:11.059 --> 00:32:12.582
it's for one show only.

573
00:32:12.713 --> 00:32:15.237
to basically get back
at her ex or something.

574
00:32:15.368 --> 00:32:17.631
I don't know. It's totally
bonkers over here.

575
00:32:17.761 --> 00:32:19.850
Who gives a shit. man?
She's rich.

576
00:32:19.981 --> 00:32:24.377
Trust me. Do not leave
that situation. Okay?

577
00:32:24.507 --> 00:32:26.553
Look at me.
I'm basically a freaking

578
00:32:26.683 --> 00:32:28.555
glorified dog walker. Okay?

579
00:32:28.685 --> 00:32:31.253
You just need to make sure
she doesn't wake up.

580
00:32:31.384 --> 00:32:32.689
and all of a sudden

581
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.300
want you out of the house.

582
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.912
which I have tips on
by the way if you want them.

583
00:32:38.043 --> 00:32:40.436
Okay. I-I--
We don't have dogs here

584
00:32:40.567 --> 00:32:42.047
so maybe that's a good idea.

585
00:32:42.177 --> 00:32:45.746
I feel it. I feel it
in my solar plexus. brother.

586
00:32:45.876 --> 00:32:48.009
This is your dharma.

587
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.403
-Just stay in the flow.
-Victor?

588
00:32:50.533 --> 00:32:52.013
What are you doing there?

589
00:32:52.144 --> 00:32:54.668
Oh. you know. waiting
for passing fucking trade.

590
00:32:54.798 --> 00:32:56.975
He's on a private call.

591
00:32:57.105 --> 00:32:59.151
Since when has that
stopped you?

592
00:32:59.281 --> 00:33:00.891
Oh. boys. I miss you.

593
00:33:02.284 --> 00:33:03.938
-Are you decent?
-Yep.

594
00:33:04.069 --> 00:33:05.070
Is that her?

595
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.636
Are we interrupting something?

596
00:33:06.767 --> 00:33:09.596
No. I was just. uh.
looking for some ideas.

597
00:33:09.726 --> 00:33:12.729
Oh. I've been
"scouting" myself.

598
00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.341
And come take a look at
what I found.

599
00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:18.997
Look at that.

600
00:33:26.439 --> 00:33:28.049
Isn't he magnificent?

601
00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.137
Hmm.

602
00:33:31.313 --> 00:33:34.403
He has such an innate
elegance and intelligence

603
00:33:34.534 --> 00:33:36.275
to the way he moves.

604
00:33:36.405 --> 00:33:37.711
And then at the same time

605
00:33:37.841 --> 00:33:40.496
there's this savage thing.
you know...

606
00:33:40.627 --> 00:33:43.499
like a primal animal.

607
00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:47.025
Just incredible.

608
00:33:47.155 --> 00:33:49.201
I think this is what we need
for the show.

609
00:33:49.331 --> 00:33:51.551
Trained dancers.
not strippers.

610
00:33:52.856 --> 00:33:55.555
Yeah. but. I mean.
as the director.

611
00:33:55.685 --> 00:33:57.992
I-I-I promise you...

612
00:33:58.123 --> 00:33:59.994
I know exactly what
we're looking for. Yeah.

613
00:34:02.866 --> 00:34:04.868
I love the way
you just did that.

614
00:34:04.999 --> 00:34:05.956
What?

615
00:34:06.087 --> 00:34:07.306
"As the director."

616
00:34:08.959 --> 00:34:12.006
You're really owning
that place. You know?

617
00:34:12.137 --> 00:34:14.356
It comes to you so naturally.

618
00:34:14.487 --> 00:34:15.879
Mm-hmm.

619
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.795
I can tell that you already
have a vision.

620
00:34:18.926 --> 00:34:22.669
And I'm sure that you agree
that this would be fantastic.

621
00:34:22.799 --> 00:34:24.801
-Yeah. he's great.
-For the show. I mean.

622
00:34:24.932 --> 00:34:26.107
Yeah. Yeah. really.
I mean. he's--

623
00:34:26.238 --> 00:34:28.544
Antonio is what we need.

624
00:34:28.675 --> 00:34:30.242
Uh. he's great. Like I said.

625
00:34:30.372 --> 00:34:32.940
he's just--
But he's also in Italy.

626
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:35.290
-Roma.
-Roma. see. I can't--

627
00:34:35.421 --> 00:34:37.336
I don't have time
to go find him in Roma

628
00:34:37.466 --> 00:34:38.859
and then bring him
all the way back here.

629
00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:40.817
Oh. no. That would be
out of the question.

630
00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:43.385
But that's why you have
a genius producer!

631
00:34:45.039 --> 00:34:46.736
He's arriving on Thursday.

632
00:34:46.867 --> 00:34:49.609
If you approve.
Creatively. I mean.

633
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:57.051
Yeah. look. if you want him.
um. sure. I-I-I approve.

634
00:34:57.182 --> 00:34:58.096
Creatively. of course.

635
00:34:58.226 --> 00:34:59.749
I'm so excited!

636
00:35:01.142 --> 00:35:02.361
Are you excited?

637
00:35:02.491 --> 00:35:05.015
Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I am.

638
00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:07.453
You don't sound excited.

639
00:35:07.583 --> 00:35:09.411
I'm very. very. very excited.
I promise.

640
00:35:09.542 --> 00:35:10.847
Oh. man. me.
I don't even think

641
00:35:10.978 --> 00:35:12.501
I am gonna be able to sleep.

642
00:35:13.154 --> 00:35:14.112
No?

643
00:35:21.206 --> 00:35:22.250
Good night.

644
00:35:25.253 --> 00:35:26.559
Sweet dreams.

645
00:35:26.689 --> 00:35:27.647
Okay.

646
00:35:29.344 --> 00:35:31.694
Wait. wait.
where are you going? Hey.

647
00:35:31.825 --> 00:35:33.870
To bed?

648
00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:35.916
We got like 10
other dancers to find.

649
00:35:36.046 --> 00:35:39.528
And that's why we have Renata.
Good night.

650
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:48.972
Per your instructions

651
00:35:49.103 --> 00:35:52.280
I've assembled
the top-tier of talent

652
00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:54.978
across multiple
movement disciplines.

653
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:58.765
And they're all
very eager to please...

654
00:35:58.895 --> 00:36:02.595
and quite athletic.
as you requested.

655
00:36:02.725 --> 00:36:05.554
Excellent work
as usual. Renata.

656
00:39:19.879 --> 00:39:21.228
She couldn't explain

657
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:22.795
the full extent
of her feelings...

658
00:39:22.925 --> 00:39:24.231
but Max knew
that she had crossed

659
00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:26.276
some kind of strange Rubicon.

660
00:39:26.407 --> 00:39:27.626
She was desperate to know

661
00:39:27.756 --> 00:39:29.454
more about
why she felt this way.

662
00:39:29.584 --> 00:39:33.719
so she purchased a litany of
books on the history of dance.

663
00:39:33.849 --> 00:39:37.070
For Mike. The Rattigan
had no symbolic weight.

664
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.029
it was simply
where he had to work.

665
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.988
And he reminded himself.

666
00:39:42.118 --> 00:39:45.339
in order to finish something.
you have to make a start.

667
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:48.951
For Maxandra. The Rattigan
had been transformed.

668
00:39:49.082 --> 00:39:51.954
It went from existing
only in the past

669
00:39:52.085 --> 00:39:54.043
to being a source of renewal.

670
00:39:54.174 --> 00:39:56.481
-Hello. hello. hello.
-Hey! Hey!

671
00:39:56.611 --> 00:39:59.484
Are you ready to transform
theater forever?

672
00:40:00.746 --> 00:40:01.834
-Whoo!
-Yeah.

673
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.447
All right.
Calm down. calm down.

674
00:40:06.578 --> 00:40:08.101
We ain't done shit yet.

675
00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:10.625
All right. you guys have
all the talent in the world.

676
00:40:10.756 --> 00:40:12.105
Ain't no questioning that.

677
00:40:12.235 --> 00:40:13.628
Each and every
single person here

678
00:40:13.759 --> 00:40:15.021
was hand selected
because they bring

679
00:40:15.151 --> 00:40:16.326
something unique to the table

680
00:40:16.457 --> 00:40:17.415
that we ain't
never seen before.

681
00:40:18.198 --> 00:40:19.591
All right?

682
00:40:19.721 --> 00:40:21.419
But I have a question for you.

683
00:40:21.549 --> 00:40:22.898
Who here. by show of hands

684
00:40:23.029 --> 00:40:24.422
has stood in front
of a thousand women

685
00:40:24.552 --> 00:40:25.597
and had to get butt-ass naked?

686
00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:31.733
Exactly.

687
00:40:31.864 --> 00:40:33.256
You want to find out how fast

688
00:40:33.387 --> 00:40:35.520
a group of sweet.
nurturing moms can make you

689
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:37.435
just go running. cowering

690
00:40:37.565 --> 00:40:39.480
into a dark corner.
wishing you were never born?

691
00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:41.134
I promise you it can happen.

692
00:40:41.264 --> 00:40:42.527
I've seen it.
And it can happen

693
00:40:42.657 --> 00:40:43.963
just like that.

694
00:40:45.747 --> 00:40:48.010
Now I can't believe I'm about
to say these words out loud.

695
00:40:48.141 --> 00:40:49.316
but we got one month.

696
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:50.709
Oh. yeah.

697
00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:52.754
We got one month to turn y'all

698
00:40:52.885 --> 00:40:54.234
into the greatest
group of strippers

699
00:40:54.364 --> 00:40:57.193
that has ever been assembled
on planet Earth.

700
00:40:57.324 --> 00:40:58.717
And to do that.

701
00:40:58.847 --> 00:41:00.196
you boys got to be ready
to get your hands dirty

702
00:41:00.327 --> 00:41:02.155
your noses wet. and them
nuts chafed as shit.

703
00:41:03.722 --> 00:41:06.376
And look. if.
if we do our jobs right...

704
00:41:06.507 --> 00:41:09.075
you're gonna have a whole
other problem on your hands.

705
00:41:09.205 --> 00:41:10.729
You're gonna have to learn

706
00:41:10.859 --> 00:41:13.079
to protect yourself
in a zombie apocalypse

707
00:41:13.209 --> 00:41:14.646
of repressed desire.

708
00:41:15.647 --> 00:41:16.648
Any questions?

709
00:41:16.778 --> 00:41:17.736
I have a question.

710
00:41:20.086 --> 00:41:22.305
Can you. you know.
fuck a zombie to death?

711
00:41:22.436 --> 00:41:24.133
Or is it still a kill shot
to the head?

712
00:41:25.526 --> 00:41:27.354
Excuse me.
what are you doing here?

713
00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:29.791
I mean. you didn't
technically fire me.

714
00:41:29.922 --> 00:41:35.101
so I'm still drawing out
that salary.

715
00:41:35.231 --> 00:41:38.757
Oh. I'm sorry. I should
have been more clear.

716
00:41:38.887 --> 00:41:40.062
You're still getting paid.

717
00:41:40.193 --> 00:41:42.108
but we no longer
need your services.

718
00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:45.807
I shouldn't have gotten
my hopes up.

719
00:41:45.938 --> 00:41:49.681
I was just really inspired
by our new director's vision.

720
00:41:50.899 --> 00:41:52.727
What-- Um. what did I say?

721
00:41:52.858 --> 00:41:54.512
He didn't say anything.

722
00:41:54.642 --> 00:41:57.732
It's not what you said.
It's who you are.

723
00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:01.040
Do you have any idea
of how long

724
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.129
I've been dreaming
of someone to walk through

725
00:42:03.259 --> 00:42:05.523
that door with a flame thrower

726
00:42:05.653 --> 00:42:09.048
and burn this whole
fucking shit to the ground?

727
00:42:09.178 --> 00:42:11.398
I can't stand
playing Lady Isabel.

728
00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:13.226
For the last six months.

729
00:42:13.356 --> 00:42:17.099
I've wanted to choke the life
out of that entitled prude.

730
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:20.189
I mean. get a grip. woman.
Jesus Christ.

731
00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.061
Like you're rich.

732
00:42:22.191 --> 00:42:23.758
send a fucking
carriage to town.

733
00:42:23.889 --> 00:42:25.934
buy up
every able-bodied man...

734
00:42:26.065 --> 00:42:28.371
soldier. sailor
instead of wasting your time

735
00:42:28.502 --> 00:42:29.982
worrying about
which boring old sod

736
00:42:30.112 --> 00:42:31.418
you're going
to sign your life away to

737
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:32.767
and have a lovely

738
00:42:32.898 --> 00:42:36.554
half-decent shag
with every last one! I--

739
00:42:42.211 --> 00:42:46.302
But it's a really good job.
it's so stable. and. um...

740
00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:49.654
so usually
I don't say all of that.

741
00:42:49.784 --> 00:42:51.873
Well. that was poetic.

742
00:42:52.004 --> 00:42:54.354
You're definitely
our audience.

743
00:42:54.484 --> 00:42:56.269
Woody. make sure
she gets an invitation.

744
00:42:56.399 --> 00:42:58.967
Hey. we're still calling this
Isabel Ascendant. right?

745
00:42:59.098 --> 00:43:00.273
Yeah. but that's just a trick

746
00:43:00.403 --> 00:43:01.622
to get the audience
into the theater

747
00:43:01.753 --> 00:43:02.710
so then we can give them
something else.

748
00:43:02.841 --> 00:43:04.320
Right. but if. what if we use

749
00:43:04.451 --> 00:43:06.453
the actual old opening
to  Isabel Ascendant?

750
00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:08.934
I mean. it could be a really
big surprise actually.

751
00:43:09.064 --> 00:43:10.544
And if I'm honest...

752
00:43:10.675 --> 00:43:11.937
if you want to make a show

753
00:43:12.067 --> 00:43:13.503
about women
getting what they want.

754
00:43:13.634 --> 00:43:14.853
wouldn't it be
a little fucking chauvinistic

755
00:43:14.983 --> 00:43:16.158
to not have
a female lead in it?

756
00:43:16.289 --> 00:43:17.246
Are you calling me
chauvinistic?

757
00:43:17.377 --> 00:43:18.508
No.

758
00:43:18.639 --> 00:43:19.771
Because
I'm the feminist here.

759
00:43:19.901 --> 00:43:20.859
-Right.
-I'm the flame-thrower.

760
00:43:20.989 --> 00:43:22.730
This whole thing was my idea.

761
00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.994
You heard her.
She's the flame-thrower.

762
00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:28.083
Uh. you're hired as Isabel

763
00:43:28.214 --> 00:43:29.432
because you were
already hired.

764
00:43:29.563 --> 00:43:30.520
Oh.
Go-- I am thrilled!

765
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:32.000
Thank you both so much.

766
00:43:34.176 --> 00:43:37.310
Will you be dancing in it?

767
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.443
Uh. no. Just. uh. directing.
Right?

768
00:43:40.574 --> 00:43:43.708
Aw. shame.

769
00:43:43.838 --> 00:43:47.929
Well now that we have
a leading lady again

770
00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.844
maybe the director
should walk us

771
00:43:49.975 --> 00:43:52.891
through the beats
of the first act.

772
00:43:53.021 --> 00:43:56.590
Yep.
Uh. first act. coming up.

773
00:43:56.721 --> 00:43:58.287
Enter Jackson.

774
00:43:58.418 --> 00:44:00.420
the low-class but sexy friend
of the husband. Line?

775
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.509
Harold said you didn't want
to go to Calais this year.

776
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.858
Is that still settled?

777
00:44:03.989 --> 00:44:05.773
-I'm sick to death of Calais.
-Theo?

778
00:44:05.904 --> 00:44:07.949
I won't hear of it.
You're going and that's that.

779
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.647
Perfect. Hit it.

780
00:44:12.127 --> 00:44:14.303
Oh. come on. No. No. No. no.

781
00:44:14.434 --> 00:44:15.740
Come on. Mike. Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

782
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:17.524
Hey. All right.
stop. stop. stop. stop.

783
00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:19.221
Stop. What's up?

784
00:44:19.352 --> 00:44:21.615
They can't just start dancing
on her out of nowhere.

785
00:44:21.746 --> 00:44:24.313
I mean. I'm down as fuck.

786
00:44:24.444 --> 00:44:25.619
Okay. Uh.
isn't that the point?

787
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:26.664
No. no. no.

788
00:44:26.794 --> 00:44:28.361
You cannot interrupt the plot.

789
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:30.102
If you want
a strong female lead

790
00:44:30.232 --> 00:44:31.581
she has to have an objective.

791
00:44:31.712 --> 00:44:33.192
At least we should know
what she wants.

792
00:44:33.322 --> 00:44:35.803
Okay. What do you
think she wants then?

793
00:44:35.934 --> 00:44:39.807
I don't know. I know she
doesn't want this life.

794
00:44:39.938 --> 00:44:41.504
So she wants to run away?

795
00:44:41.635 --> 00:44:43.593
She can't do that.

796
00:44:43.724 --> 00:44:46.161
Why?
She's a free person. right?

797
00:44:46.292 --> 00:44:49.556
She has a family.
There would be consequences.

798
00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:51.210
Right.
So it's about the money.

799
00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.733
Oh. that's the least of it.

800
00:44:52.864 --> 00:44:54.953
She would lose her friends.
opportunities.

801
00:44:55.083 --> 00:44:58.696
Her identity. Her whole world
would be torn apart.

802
00:44:58.826 --> 00:45:01.133
I don't know. It sounds to me
that she just needs to let go.

803
00:45:01.263 --> 00:45:03.439
-And some good dick!
-Maybe that as well.

804
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:07.269
This show is not about
getting dick. Only.

805
00:45:08.575 --> 00:45:10.359
She needs to solve
her dilemma.

806
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:12.797
It's not like some
magic unicorn is gonna

807
00:45:12.927 --> 00:45:15.495
come down and make all her
wildest fantasies come true.

808
00:45:17.018 --> 00:45:18.759
Uh. what was that?

809
00:45:22.502 --> 00:45:24.504
Could be not the worst idea.

810
00:45:26.288 --> 00:45:27.768
Oh. no way.

811
00:45:27.899 --> 00:45:30.902
Hear me out.
Just-- What about--

812
00:45:31.032 --> 00:45:33.513
Where the fuck am I
gonna get a horse?

813
00:45:33.643 --> 00:45:35.341
What about a  caballito?
Like a tiny one.

814
00:45:35.471 --> 00:45:36.821
I don't have  caballito budget.

815
00:45:36.951 --> 00:45:38.692
Wait. What-- How-- Okay.
what if you don't see it?

816
00:45:38.823 --> 00:45:39.737
What if you don't
see the horse?

817
00:45:42.609 --> 00:45:44.219
No. that's not right.

818
00:45:46.482 --> 00:45:47.483
No.

819
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:51.531
How long have you
been standing there?

820
00:45:51.661 --> 00:45:54.664
-Long enough. May I?
-Yes.

821
00:45:59.408 --> 00:46:00.627
So you've worked with Max

822
00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:02.716
and this Roger dude
a long time?

823
00:46:02.847 --> 00:46:05.023
All 18 wonderful years.

824
00:46:05.153 --> 00:46:06.764
Wow. So you must know
these friends

825
00:46:06.894 --> 00:46:08.026
that we're going
to see tonight.

826
00:46:08.156 --> 00:46:09.592
What are they like?

827
00:46:09.723 --> 00:46:12.204
Hmm. They like things
to stay the same. sir.

828
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.685
All right.

829
00:46:15.816 --> 00:46:18.079
How do I look? And don't
give me any bullshit answer.

830
00:46:19.646 --> 00:46:21.213
You know something...

831
00:46:22.388 --> 00:46:24.477
they'd just laugh at you
in a tie.

832
00:46:33.312 --> 00:46:35.096
Holy shit.

833
00:46:35.227 --> 00:46:38.447
-What?
-You! That suit.

834
00:46:38.578 --> 00:46:40.710
You look incredibly expensive.

835
00:46:41.711 --> 00:46:43.713
You have no idea.

836
00:46:52.418 --> 00:46:54.550
One of the most
primal feelings

837
00:46:54.681 --> 00:46:57.858
human beings experience
is the desire to belong

838
00:46:57.989 --> 00:46:59.947
to feel connected
to other beings.

839
00:47:00.078 --> 00:47:01.949
and to be part of a tribe.

840
00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.038
In fact.
brain scans have shown

841
00:47:04.169 --> 00:47:06.562
that social rejection
creates virtually

842
00:47:06.693 --> 00:47:09.043
identical brain activity
as physical assault.

843
00:47:09.174 --> 00:47:10.915
Mike didn't know that...

844
00:47:11.045 --> 00:47:13.004
but he knew dancing could
bring people together.

845
00:47:13.134 --> 00:47:16.007
Even if some of those
people are snobs.

846
00:47:16.137 --> 00:47:18.487
And he knew
that Victor was right.

847
00:47:18.618 --> 00:47:20.185
they would have laughed
at him in a tie.

848
00:47:26.147 --> 00:47:28.236
And he says. "Now
that's how you wave a towel!"

849
00:47:31.674 --> 00:47:34.112
Anyways. so. give us
the latest gossip. Max.

850
00:47:34.242 --> 00:47:37.289
-Yeah. go on.
-And don't hold back a lick.

851
00:47:37.419 --> 00:47:39.465
You know
I don't hold back my licks.

852
00:47:39.595 --> 00:47:41.554
-True.

853
00:47:41.684 --> 00:47:43.469
But there's nothing for me
to tell you.

854
00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:45.036
You already know everything...

855
00:47:45.166 --> 00:47:48.387
since you double agents
are all talking to Roger.

856
00:47:48.517 --> 00:47:49.649
-Oh. come on.
-That's not true.

857
00:47:49.779 --> 00:47:51.303
-That's not true.
-I'm offended.

858
00:47:51.433 --> 00:47:52.957
Last I heard.

859
00:47:53.087 --> 00:47:55.176
he had at least broken it off
with the girl. So...

860
00:47:55.307 --> 00:47:58.397
And so. she should just run
back to him then. should she?

861
00:47:58.527 --> 00:48:00.312
No. that's not
what I'm implying.

862
00:48:00.442 --> 00:48:02.009
I'm just-- You know.
it's something. isn't it?

863
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.403
-It takes time. Bill.
-Of course.

864
00:48:04.533 --> 00:48:05.883
Or have you forgotten?

865
00:48:06.013 --> 00:48:07.797
Ooh. hello.

866
00:48:07.928 --> 00:48:11.192
Thank you for your concern.
but you must know that...

867
00:48:12.672 --> 00:48:15.283
I'm the happiest
I've ever been in my life.

868
00:48:15.414 --> 00:48:16.676
Oh. that's really good
to hear.

869
00:48:16.806 --> 00:48:17.895
Oh. rubbish.

870
00:48:18.025 --> 00:48:19.635
Phoebe!

871
00:48:19.766 --> 00:48:22.769
He can do whatever he wants.
and so can I.

872
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.466
-Yeah.
-How modern.

873
00:48:24.597 --> 00:48:26.512
But what does that actually
mean for the divorce?

874
00:48:26.642 --> 00:48:28.035
The divorce. The divorce.

875
00:48:28.166 --> 00:48:30.516
Don't you have something else
to talk about?

876
00:48:30.646 --> 00:48:33.301
I mean. besides. uh.
Bill jokes. Let's have fun.

877
00:48:33.432 --> 00:48:34.912
Mike. why don't you
tell them--

878
00:48:35.042 --> 00:48:36.696
-I was just telling--
-Wait. no. listen to this.

879
00:48:36.826 --> 00:48:39.046
You have to hear his vision
for  Isabel Ascendant.

880
00:48:39.177 --> 00:48:40.352
-Oh. yeah.
-Oh. yes.

881
00:48:40.482 --> 00:48:42.397
Uh. yeah. Well. I mean.

882
00:48:42.528 --> 00:48:44.443
as we were talking about
we think it's. uh...

883
00:48:44.573 --> 00:48:45.923
it's very important to honor.

884
00:48:46.053 --> 00:48:48.490
uh. the original
source material.

885
00:48:48.621 --> 00:48:50.144
Yeah.
but to do that properly--

886
00:48:50.275 --> 00:48:54.279
And say no more.
It has to be a surprise.

887
00:48:54.409 --> 00:48:55.802
-Right.
-Okay.

888
00:48:55.933 --> 00:48:57.151
It's so smart
to revive a classic.

889
00:48:57.282 --> 00:48:58.283
Absolutely.

890
00:48:58.413 --> 00:48:59.588
That is very hot right now.

891
00:48:59.719 --> 00:49:01.155
Yeah. Yeah.
I mean. I don't know

892
00:49:01.286 --> 00:49:02.983
if I would exactly call it
a classic revival...

893
00:49:03.114 --> 00:49:04.680
uh. Phoebe. but I--

894
00:49:04.811 --> 00:49:06.378
You know. the way that I think
we were looking at it is

895
00:49:06.508 --> 00:49:07.553
that it really needed to be
stripped down.

896
00:49:07.683 --> 00:49:08.684
oiled. and spanked.

897
00:49:11.165 --> 00:49:14.168
No. No.

898
00:49:14.299 --> 00:49:16.431
He loves metaphors.

899
00:49:16.562 --> 00:49:19.043
So Mike. is there a vibrant
theatrical community in Miami?

900
00:49:19.173 --> 00:49:20.305
Yeah. for the right amount
of dollars

901
00:49:20.435 --> 00:49:21.349
I think you can have
as vibrant

902
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.481
of a time as you would like.

903
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:26.441
I imagine you've done a lot
of work with Art Basel.

904
00:49:26.572 --> 00:49:28.487
No. no. I don't-- Who's that?
I don't know him.

905
00:49:32.882 --> 00:49:34.580
-Come on. guys.
-Oh. my God.

906
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:37.975
Of course. I know Art Basel.
It's the most famous art fair.

907
00:49:38.105 --> 00:49:40.238
It happens in my city
every single year.

908
00:49:40.368 --> 00:49:42.892
-Wow. Your face just now...

909
00:49:43.023 --> 00:49:44.982
Well. I mean. if the show's
anything like him.

910
00:49:45.112 --> 00:49:46.548
count me in.

911
00:49:46.679 --> 00:49:48.420
You better talk to him
while you can because

912
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:52.424
he's about to get super famous
and super unavailable.

913
00:49:52.554 --> 00:49:53.903
Wow.

914
00:49:54.034 --> 00:49:54.861
Well. that's quite
a build-up.

915
00:49:54.992 --> 00:49:56.123
That's a deal.

916
00:49:56.254 --> 00:49:57.907
I don't know about all that.
but yes.

917
00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.650
She is looking unusually
radiant tonight.

918
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:04.784
Yeah. I guess. um...
I don't know.

919
00:50:04.914 --> 00:50:08.048
It must be good for the soul.
the whole divorce.

920
00:50:08.179 --> 00:50:11.312
-Divorce.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

921
00:50:11.443 --> 00:50:12.661
Yeah. I'm-- What?

922
00:50:12.792 --> 00:50:14.141
Do you guys
have a different word

923
00:50:14.272 --> 00:50:15.621
for the ending
of a marriage here?

924
00:50:15.751 --> 00:50:18.189
Uh. yeah. When it's untrue.
Yeah.

925
00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:20.060
I mean. yes. they have an
agreement at the moment.

926
00:50:20.191 --> 00:50:21.453
Yeah.

927
00:50:21.583 --> 00:50:23.672
But. I mean.
that family pre-nup

928
00:50:23.803 --> 00:50:25.109
is going to take a decade
to litigate.

929
00:50:25.239 --> 00:50:26.501
Exactly.

930
00:50:26.632 --> 00:50:27.633
Plus she knows
that at the end of it

931
00:50:27.763 --> 00:50:28.764
she'll get absolutely nothing.

932
00:50:28.895 --> 00:50:30.331
-Which she'll hate.
-Yeah.

933
00:50:30.462 --> 00:50:31.724
What she needs is to be
able to stay with him.

934
00:50:31.854 --> 00:50:34.422
but not actually be with him.

935
00:50:34.553 --> 00:50:36.033
That would be
the golden ticket.

936
00:50:36.163 --> 00:50:37.469
I wish you had gotten up.

937
00:50:37.599 --> 00:50:39.601
and really taken
your clothes off.

938
00:50:39.732 --> 00:50:40.907
Okay. let's go back there.

939
00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:42.300
I'll take my clothes off
right now.

940
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:43.431
I would have loved
to see their faces.

941
00:50:43.562 --> 00:50:44.954
-Yeah.
-They are so fake.

942
00:50:45.085 --> 00:50:46.739
They are the fakest people
I know.

943
00:50:46.869 --> 00:50:50.525
I think the only person that
is real in my life is Zadie.

944
00:50:50.656 --> 00:50:52.179
She's about as real
as it gets at times.

945
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:54.051
Yes. She'll tell you
what she thinks.

946
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.010
What about you. Mike?

947
00:50:58.751 --> 00:51:00.492
Are you real?

948
00:51:00.622 --> 00:51:03.103
What do you mean. am I real?
Am I-- Do you think I'm real?

949
00:51:04.278 --> 00:51:05.279
I don't know.

950
00:51:07.064 --> 00:51:11.068
You know. sometimes
you kind of feel like a dream.

951
00:51:11.633 --> 00:51:13.070
Hmm.

952
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.028
I mean. you look like a dream.

953
00:51:15.159 --> 00:51:16.073
Mm-hmm.

954
00:51:18.423 --> 00:51:20.077
You smell like a dream.

955
00:51:20.207 --> 00:51:21.121
Mm-hmm.

956
00:51:23.167 --> 00:51:25.169
You taste like a dream.

957
00:51:32.393 --> 00:51:35.570
Wait. I just want
to make sure. Listen.

958
00:51:35.701 --> 00:51:37.572
No. it's okay.
No. I get it. I get it.

959
00:51:37.703 --> 00:51:39.183
No. no. no. No. no. no.
Wait. wait. wait.

960
00:51:39.313 --> 00:51:41.098
-That was really stupid.
-No. I just--

961
00:51:41.141 --> 00:51:42.577
No. I just want to tell you--
No. no. I'm sorry. I didn't--

962
00:51:42.621 --> 00:51:44.057
You know what? I'm sorry.
I'm just so drunk.

963
00:51:44.188 --> 00:51:45.450
-I shouldn't have stopped--

964
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.973
What? You had. like.
one glass of wine.

965
00:51:47.104 --> 00:51:48.105
No. look. that was my fault.
That was my--

966
00:51:48.148 --> 00:51:49.367
Are you saying I'm crazy?

967
00:51:49.497 --> 00:51:50.455
No. I'm definitely not
saying you're crazy.

968
00:51:50.585 --> 00:51:52.109
Are you telling me I'm crazy?

969
00:51:52.239 --> 00:51:53.371
I'm saying I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to stop you.

970
00:51:53.501 --> 00:51:54.807
Well. this was
uncalled for so...

971
00:51:54.937 --> 00:51:56.156
obviously if I'm not drunk.
I'm crazy.

972
00:51:56.287 --> 00:51:57.462
I didn't mean to stop you.
Come here.

973
00:51:57.592 --> 00:51:58.941
Stop. Hey-- Max. stop.
I'm sorry.

974
00:51:59.072 --> 00:52:00.117
And I'm not crazy.
I am very drunk actually.

975
00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.119
Stop. Stop. Listen to my--

976
00:52:02.249 --> 00:52:04.425
No. you stop.
I don't want to listen to you.

977
00:52:04.556 --> 00:52:08.299
Right now. anything that you
say to me is gonna be wrong.

978
00:52:09.996 --> 00:52:13.565
I already said I'm sorry.
Okay? I get it. I get it.

979
00:52:13.695 --> 00:52:16.655
You don't have to like.
rub it in.

980
00:52:16.785 --> 00:52:18.004
All right.

981
00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:20.398
No pity talking or anything.
I get it.

982
00:52:26.273 --> 00:52:29.798
Can you put some music on.
Victor?

983
00:52:39.025 --> 00:52:42.898
♪ Why don't we steal away

984
00:52:43.029 --> 00:52:44.552
♪ Into the night

985
00:52:46.859 --> 00:52:48.687
♪ I know it ain't right

986
00:52:59.088 --> 00:53:01.613
Oh. hello. Good morning.

987
00:53:01.743 --> 00:53:03.005
Good morning.

988
00:53:03.136 --> 00:53:04.659
What are you doing up
so early?

989
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.270
I'm writing a novel.

990
00:53:07.184 --> 00:53:09.708
-A novel?
-Mm-hmm.

991
00:53:09.838 --> 00:53:12.580
They make you write novels
in school over here?

992
00:53:12.711 --> 00:53:14.800
Do you assume that
because of my age

993
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:15.888
I only have
the mental capacity

994
00:53:16.018 --> 00:53:17.759
to write a novel for school?

995
00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:20.197
No. I just don't know anyone
that's ever written a novel.

996
00:53:21.285 --> 00:53:22.982
What is it about?

997
00:53:23.112 --> 00:53:26.246
It's about some people who
know each other and do things.

998
00:53:26.377 --> 00:53:28.422
It's about every time I draw

999
00:53:28.553 --> 00:53:30.859
another gentrified breath
into my helpless body.

1000
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:33.514
And it's about 40 pages.

1001
00:53:33.645 --> 00:53:35.081
That's a good amount of pages.

1002
00:53:35.212 --> 00:53:36.169
It is.

1003
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.301
How many are you gonna go for?

1004
00:53:38.258 --> 00:53:40.042
A few more.

1005
00:53:40.173 --> 00:53:41.740
-What's up. Vic?
-Yeah. right.

1006
00:53:43.916 --> 00:53:46.658
What? What?
Why is he like that?

1007
00:53:46.788 --> 00:53:49.400
If he acts like he likes you.
he hates you.

1008
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:51.228
And if he acts like
he hates you...

1009
00:53:51.358 --> 00:53:55.057
it's a sign of respect because
he actually does hate you.

1010
00:53:55.188 --> 00:53:58.583
Yeah. that's not helpful.
Why doesn't he just quit?

1011
00:53:58.713 --> 00:54:01.542
Same reason you don't quit.
Systemic economic inequality.

1012
00:54:03.152 --> 00:54:06.243
Speaking of. have you seen
Maxandra this morning?

1013
00:54:06.373 --> 00:54:08.593
No. And why do you
call her that?

1014
00:54:08.723 --> 00:54:09.898
You know she hates it.

1015
00:54:10.029 --> 00:54:11.291
She brought me
from an orphanage.

1016
00:54:11.422 --> 00:54:12.945
saying "mother"
would feel like a lie.

1017
00:54:13.075 --> 00:54:15.556
Come on.
That's a little strong.

1018
00:54:15.687 --> 00:54:17.602
Look. she's doing
the best she can.

1019
00:54:17.732 --> 00:54:19.647
And she loves
the shit out of you.

1020
00:54:19.778 --> 00:54:21.388
I think the real question is

1021
00:54:21.519 --> 00:54:22.998
why do you love
the shit out of her?

1022
00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:28.656
Love is a really.
really big word. Zadie.

1023
00:54:28.787 --> 00:54:30.658
And. look. the truth is

1024
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:33.313
no one's believed in me
like your mom has. so I--

1025
00:54:33.444 --> 00:54:36.273
-Zadie?
-Hi. Roger.

1026
00:54:36.403 --> 00:54:37.752
Hello. dear.

1027
00:54:37.883 --> 00:54:39.972
That's your--

1028
00:54:40.102 --> 00:54:44.063
-Is your mother around?
-Maxandra is upstairs.

1029
00:54:44.193 --> 00:54:45.934
And who's this?

1030
00:54:46.065 --> 00:54:47.501
This is Mike.

1031
00:54:47.632 --> 00:54:50.330
Mike is the new director
for  Isabel Ascendant.

1032
00:54:50.461 --> 00:54:52.767
-Ah. right.
-What's up?

1033
00:54:53.507 --> 00:54:54.769
Roger Rattigan.

1034
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.468
Michael Jeffrey Lane.

1035
00:54:57.598 --> 00:54:58.773
I hope Max didn't schedule

1036
00:54:58.904 --> 00:55:00.166
to meet both of us
at the same time.

1037
00:55:01.472 --> 00:55:03.300
-He's staying here.
-Ah.

1038
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:06.564
-Mm-hmm.
-Well. no conflict then.

1039
00:55:07.391 --> 00:55:09.001
No.

1040
00:55:09.131 --> 00:55:11.395
I hope the theater itself

this specific dance

than dancing.

is called "Permission."

1129

Some scholars
suggest that dance

1130
01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:39.897
once was a form
of communication

1131
01:00:40.027 --> 01:00:43.161
as integral to our daily life
as eating or sleeping.

1132
01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:45.772
Traditionally.
tribal courtship dances

1133
01:00:45.903 --> 01:00:47.556
allowed dancers
of opposite sexes

1134
01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:49.558
to engage
in socially acceptable

1135
01:00:49.689 --> 01:00:51.473
physical contact
before they were even

1136
01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:53.519
allowed to speak
to one another.

1137
01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.303
Only when
a leisure class began

1138
01:00:55.434 --> 01:00:57.741
to emerge out of early
economic development

1139
01:00:57.871 --> 01:00:59.046
did humans begin to view dance

1140
01:00:59.177 --> 01:01:00.395
as a source of pleasure apart

1141
01:01:00.526 --> 01:01:02.223
from its original purpose.

1142
01:01:02.354 --> 01:01:05.009
to bridge people together
from different worlds...

1143
01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:07.664
to heal wounds
when words would not suffice.

1144
01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:15.889
All right. you all ready?

1145
01:01:16.977 --> 01:01:18.544

Stop the music! Stop!

Hey! Excuse me.

01:01:36.736 --> 01:01:38.520

1150
01:01:41.262 --> 01:01:44.222

01:01:45.136 --> 01:01:46.659
Oh. I would think so.

1152
01:01:53.274 --> 01:01:54.406
Anything else?

1153
01:01:56.756 --> 01:01:58.279
You'll be hearing from us.

1154
01:02:03.371 --> 01:02:04.590
We're fucked.

1155
01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:09.726
"The owner must obtain

approval or special exemption.

1158
01:02:14.687 --> 01:02:15.862

the theater
to its original condition

1160

for approval with the city."

trying to control me.

1163
01:02:25.872 --> 01:02:26.960
and in the middle of a divorce

1164
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:28.832
because he fucked
the assistant.

I'm sorry. baby.

1166
01:02:33.619 --> 01:02:34.881
but it's not like
it's a secret.

1167
01:02:36.274 --> 01:02:38.189
What if we just do it anyway?

1168
01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:40.060
I mean. what are they
really gonna do?

1169
01:02:40.191 --> 01:02:41.758
"Failure to comply will result

1170
01:02:41.888 --> 01:02:43.847
in a fine of 10.000 pounds
per day...

1171

and/or seizure of the property

1172

Even if I pay the fine.

1173
01:02:48.895 --> 01:02:51.724
he'll find a way to exert
pressure on these people

1174
01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:53.595
and force them
to bend the rules.

1175
01:02:53.726 --> 01:02:55.162
That's just the way
he operates.

1176
01:02:55.293 --> 01:02:56.729
-Isn't it. Victor?
-Well. in my opinion--

1177
01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:58.383
We have to go
all the way to the top

1178
01:02:58.513 --> 01:03:00.733
because our freedom
is an illusion.

1179
01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:02.517
Yes. see when you start
with no rights at all--

1180
01:03:02.648 --> 01:03:04.389
So who is this person
we need to seduce

1181
01:03:04.519 --> 01:03:05.782
and get them on our side?

1182
01:03:05.912 --> 01:03:08.001
I.e.. the definition
of corruption.

1183
01:03:09.263 --> 01:03:10.699
Zadie. baby...

1184
01:03:12.223 --> 01:03:13.746
you should know that the law

1185
01:03:13.877 --> 01:03:15.530
is useless
when you're dealing

1186
01:03:15.661 --> 01:03:18.098
with entrenched
male power structures.

1187
01:03:18.229 --> 01:03:20.361
-Not all male.
-What do you mean?

1188
01:03:20.492 --> 01:03:21.972
Edna Eaglebauer.

1189
01:03:22.102 --> 01:03:23.538
As the chairwoman.

1190
01:03:23.669 --> 01:03:24.888
she has the power
to grant a special exemption.

1191
01:03:25.018 --> 01:03:27.151
Hey. Z. what else
do we know about Edna?

1192
01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:35.942
Um. not much about her
on Google.

1193
01:03:36.073 --> 01:03:37.596
Housing records indicate

1194
01:03:37.726 --> 01:03:38.771
she's most likely single
and lives alone.

1195
01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:40.817
That's promising.

1196
01:03:40.947 --> 01:03:43.210
Um. she's got
no presence on social media.

1197
01:03:43.341 --> 01:03:46.866
Asides her bio
on the council website.

1198
01:03:46.997 --> 01:03:49.695
Check if she has
a pet or a hobby.

1199
01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:53.830
Not that I can tell.
She's a ghost.

1200
01:04:48.362 --> 01:04:49.494
I'll tell you what...

1201
01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:50.669
this bird's got to have
a heart of stone

1202
01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:52.236
to shut down  Swan Lake.

1203
01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:54.499
Maybe. but everybody
wants something.

1204
01:04:54.629 --> 01:04:56.893
We just got to keep looking.

1205
01:04:57.023 --> 01:04:59.678
What if she didn't even know
what she wants?

1206
01:04:59.808 --> 01:05:01.419
Well. that never stopped men

1207
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:03.900
from coming up
with the wrong answer.

1208
01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:05.510
Come on. guys.
give me something.

1209
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.946
Victor. don't just sit there.

1210
01:05:07.077 --> 01:05:08.643
I'll murder her
for the right price.

1211
01:05:08.774 --> 01:05:10.210
That might be the best idea.

1212
01:05:10.341 --> 01:05:11.559
But. look. this feels like

1213
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:13.431
a woman's perspective
sort of a thing.

1214
01:05:13.561 --> 01:05:15.781
Like what did you want
before Miami?

1215
01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.391
I just wanted
to escape my life.

1216
01:05:19.698 --> 01:05:21.700
But then...

1217
01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:26.792
someone came along and
gave me this unexpected

1218
01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:32.972
magical moment that made
me remember who I really was.

1219
01:05:33.103 --> 01:05:35.148
It was like a little treasure.

1220
01:05:35.279 --> 01:05:37.934
Okay. so we need to figure out
who Edna was before

1221
01:05:38.064 --> 01:05:40.240
she became a bureaucrat
and tap into that then.

1222
01:05:41.633 --> 01:05:42.677
That's it!

1223
01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.694
I don't understand why
you don't want "Suavemente."

1224
01:07:26.825 --> 01:07:28.044
I don't think-- No.
I love "Suavemente."

1225
01:07:28.174 --> 01:07:29.654
It's a great song.

1226
01:07:29.784 --> 01:07:30.959
-It's a different beat.
-It is great. I agree.

1227
01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:32.396
We just don't need it
right now.

1228
01:07:32.526 --> 01:07:33.745
Look. it-- Look.
hear me out. It's Isabel...

1229
01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:35.094
Unicorn. "Champagne."
"Sex Machine..."

1230
01:07:35.225 --> 01:07:36.400
-Oh. trust me...
-"Permission." "Suits."

1231
01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:37.705
I know it by heart.
And you know what's more

1232
01:07:37.836 --> 01:07:39.011
important than "Suavemente"?

1233
01:07:39.142 --> 01:07:40.621
We still don't have
a grand finale.

1234
01:07:40.752 --> 01:07:42.058
Well. great. We'll make one.
It's a group number.

1235
01:07:42.188 --> 01:07:43.537
Most important part
of the whole show.

1236
01:07:43.581 --> 01:07:44.582
And then everybody
will dance out into the crowd.

1237
01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:45.931
It'll be amazing.

1238
01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:48.064
-Oh. that's so random.
-Why is that random?

1239
01:07:48.194 --> 01:07:49.152
Everybody dancing
in the crowd.

1240
01:07:49.282 --> 01:07:50.501
We've done that already.

1241
01:07:50.631 --> 01:07:51.719
It's got to be
something different.

1242
01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:53.243
something personal.

1243
01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:54.679
They're all good and personal.

1244
01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:55.984
and they're there
for a reason. I don't--

1245
01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:57.725
Why are you doing this
right now?

1246
01:07:57.856 --> 01:08:00.119
Why are you making it. like.
we don't have a good show?

1247
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:03.296
I know. You should be
dancing in it.

1248
01:08:03.427 --> 01:08:05.820
You have lost your mind.
What are you talking about?

1249
01:08:05.951 --> 01:08:07.300
I'm not dancing in the show.

1250
01:08:07.431 --> 01:08:08.867
Why are you saying no
to everything I say?

1251
01:08:08.997 --> 01:08:10.347
-I'm not saying no.
-Have you noticed that?

1252
01:08:10.477 --> 01:08:12.175
I've said yes on every
single part of the show.

1253
01:08:12.305 --> 01:08:15.569
We need something climactic.
different. something personal.

1254
01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.876
Great. then do
something personal.

1255
01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:19.312
Give me something
that I don't know about you.

1256
01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:21.314
Why is it about me?
This is about women.

1257
01:08:21.445 --> 01:08:22.881
You're a woman. I'm not.

1258
01:08:23.011 --> 01:08:24.187
I'm not gonna be dancing
in the show.

1259
01:08:24.317 --> 01:08:25.623
Why don't you
make it personal?

1260
01:08:25.753 --> 01:08:27.146
Well. do whatever you want.

1261
01:08:27.277 --> 01:08:28.930
Do the thing that you and
Antonio have been making.

1262
01:08:29.061 --> 01:08:31.107
It's great.
That's personal. ain't it?

1263
01:08:31.237 --> 01:08:33.152
Hey. it's your show.

1264
01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:34.980
Give me something
that's yours.

1265
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.895
Open up.

1266
01:08:37.025 --> 01:08:39.071
-I did.
-When?

1267
01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:40.812
The whole--
This whole time.

1268
01:08:40.942 --> 01:08:42.205
And if you haven't seen it.

1269
01:08:42.335 --> 01:08:43.902
I don't know
what to tell you about it.

1270
01:08:44.032 --> 01:08:45.338
Well. I don't know what
to tell you about it since

1271
01:08:45.469 --> 01:08:47.558
I tried to kiss you
and you pulled away.

1272
01:08:47.688 --> 01:08:49.516
You don't know how to open up.

1273
01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:51.431
That's why you need
the "Suavemente."

1274
01:08:51.562 --> 01:08:55.348
Oh! Still waiting for passing
trade. you nosy fuck!

1275
01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:58.134
Your turn; he's impossible.

1276
01:09:15.238 --> 01:09:16.804
Yes. Victor?

1277
01:09:16.935 --> 01:09:18.502
I did not say anything.

1278
01:09:18.632 --> 01:09:20.156
Yeah. Yeah. You're always
saying something in your head.

1279
01:09:20.286 --> 01:09:21.635
Just say it out loud. man.

1280
01:09:23.985 --> 01:09:26.858
You see.
the problem with Max is

1281
01:09:26.988 --> 01:09:29.165
she tends to
overcomplicate things.

1282
01:09:29.295 --> 01:09:30.731
Yeah.

1283
01:09:30.862 --> 01:09:33.038
Especially when she knows
exactly what she wants.

1284
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.083
And she knows exactly
what she wants

1285
01:09:35.214 --> 01:09:36.302
when it comes to you.

1286
01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:43.657
Why do you work for her?

1287
01:09:43.788 --> 01:09:45.398
You could easily
work for Roger.

1288
01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:48.401
She's got bigger balls.

1289
01:09:52.536 --> 01:09:53.885
Listen. motherfucker.

1290
01:09:54.015 --> 01:09:55.147
-I rest my case.
-Yeah.

1291
01:09:55.278 --> 01:09:56.670
You better make up your mind

1292
01:09:56.801 --> 01:09:58.063
because you're
driving me crazy.

1293
01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.195
Oh. just-- Yeah.
you're driving me crazy.

1294
01:09:59.325 --> 01:10:00.500
What are you doing?

1295
01:10:00.631 --> 01:10:01.849
Just stop.

1296
01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.243
-Okay. just shut up.
-No. you stop.

1297
01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:06.376
You shut up.

1298
01:10:06.506 --> 01:10:09.074
I just want a happy ending.

1299
01:10:13.034 --> 01:10:15.254
You're an insane
person. You know that. right?

1300
01:10:15.385 --> 01:10:16.734
Mm-hmm.

1301
01:10:44.892 --> 01:10:46.938
Given the debate
and confusion

1302
01:10:47.068 --> 01:10:49.157
around the word
"love" generally...

1303
01:10:49.288 --> 01:10:51.421
what are we to make
of the word "love"

1304
01:10:51.551 --> 01:10:53.423
in the context of dancing?

1305
01:10:53.553 --> 01:10:55.903
If you love dancing
with someone.

1306
01:10:56.034 --> 01:10:58.645
does that mean on some level
that you love them?

1307
01:10:58.776 --> 01:11:01.909
What other feelings are
exchanged during a dance?

1308
01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.434
Can you dance with someone
you don't trust?

1309
01:11:04.564 --> 01:11:07.524
Should you trust someone
just because they can dance?

1310
01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:10.004
Max and Mike weren't
thinking about this.

1311
01:11:10.135 --> 01:11:11.484
but they should have been.

1312
01:11:11.615 --> 01:11:13.138
Stop the music!

1313
01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.619
Stop the music!
Stop the music.

1314
01:11:16.837 --> 01:11:18.274
-Edna?
-Edna?

1315
01:11:18.404 --> 01:11:20.145
I am so sorry. Ms. Mendoza.

1316
01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:21.755
I am so deeply sorry

1317
01:11:21.886 --> 01:11:24.323
to each and every one of you
beautiful creatures.

1318
01:11:24.454 --> 01:11:25.672
Sorry for what?

1319
01:11:25.803 --> 01:11:27.413
Height restrictions
for stage risers.

1320
01:11:27.544 --> 01:11:29.110
Apparently. your new stage

1321
01:11:29.241 --> 01:11:30.503
is three quarters of an inch
too high.

1322
01:11:30.634 --> 01:11:32.157
Your exemption
has been denied.

1323
01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.725
You're to shut down
immediately.

1324
01:11:34.855 --> 01:11:36.901
But you had already
approved it!

1325
01:11:37.031 --> 01:11:40.861
I got a call from an
MP's office. It's law.

1326
01:11:40.992 --> 01:11:42.298
There's nothing I can do.

1327
01:11:44.561 --> 01:11:47.781
Keep working. I'll take care
of this. I'll be right back.

1328
01:11:47.912 --> 01:11:48.869
Okay.

1329
01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:05.886
How fucking dare you?

1330
01:12:06.017 --> 01:12:08.672
You're not shutting me
down again. Not this time.

1331
01:12:08.802 --> 01:12:11.631
Max. I sincerely
want to rebuild our trust.

1332
01:12:11.762 --> 01:12:13.024
-In the meantime.

1333
01:12:13.154 --> 01:12:14.982
I'm just trying
to look out for you.

1334
01:12:15.113 --> 01:12:17.245
How is shutting down my show
looking out for me?

1335
01:12:17.376 --> 01:12:18.595
I'm not talking
about the show.

1336
01:12:18.725 --> 01:12:19.900
Then what are you
talking about?

1337
01:12:20.031 --> 01:12:21.946
I'm talking
about your judgment.

1338
01:12:22.076 --> 01:12:24.122
I'm talking what I witnessed
in the kitchen

1339
01:12:24.252 --> 01:12:25.384
in front of our daughter.

1340
01:12:25.515 --> 01:12:28.039
Roger. I wouldn't
get into a dispute

1341
01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:29.867
about judgment with me
right now.

1342
01:12:29.997 --> 01:12:33.392
You handed my family's theater
over to a fucking stripper.

1343
01:12:35.133 --> 01:12:37.396
You don't know anything
about Mike.

1344
01:12:37.527 --> 01:12:41.008
I know when you're being used.
Don't you see that?

1345
01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:42.488
No.

1346
01:12:43.881 --> 01:12:46.884
Darling. I know
we're all getting old.

1347
01:12:47.014 --> 01:12:49.365
but I didn't know
you were so desperate.

1348
01:12:49.495 --> 01:12:52.585
Fuck you!
We care for each other.

1349
01:12:52.716 --> 01:12:55.632
Max. have you even read
our settlement agreement?

1350
01:12:55.762 --> 01:12:59.200
The language about denigrating
or harming the family brand?

1351
01:12:59.331 --> 01:13:01.115
The moment that show goes up.

1352
01:13:01.246 --> 01:13:03.030
mother's barristers
will be clawing back

1353
01:13:03.161 --> 01:13:04.945
every last shilling in court

1354
01:13:05.076 --> 01:13:06.773
and I won't be able
to stop her.

1355
01:13:06.904 --> 01:13:10.211
But if you're still too
deluded to help yourself.

1356
01:13:10.342 --> 01:13:12.518
please be mindful of Zadie.

1357
01:13:12.649 --> 01:13:15.695
She shouldn't have to pay
the price for your fantasies.

1358
01:13:21.571 --> 01:13:22.789
Would you please stop it?

1359
01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.704
What?

1360
01:13:24.835 --> 01:13:26.489
I know what you're thinking.

1361
01:13:26.619 --> 01:13:28.404
You're thinking.
"What was she thinking?"

1362
01:13:28.534 --> 01:13:30.144
You weren't thinking.
were you?

1363
01:13:30.275 --> 01:13:31.407
You were falling in love.

1364
01:13:31.537 --> 01:13:33.104
Oh. shut the fuck up.

1365
01:13:33.234 --> 01:13:34.845
You think I don't know that?

1366
01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:37.282
And don't you dare judge me.
You were not there.

1367
01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:39.676
That one fucking dance...

1368
01:13:40.677 --> 01:13:42.505
changed everything in me.

1369
01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:49.642
It feels like it made me
the best version of myself...

1370
01:13:49.773 --> 01:13:51.035
but everybody's
laughing at me.

1371
01:13:51.165 --> 01:13:52.863
I'm a joke. An embarrassment.

1372
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.475
Not to him though.

1373
01:13:58.695 --> 01:14:00.523
He believes in me.

1374
01:14:00.653 --> 01:14:02.394
I have to go tell him

1375
01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:05.658
that our show about empowering
women is dead...

1376
01:14:05.789 --> 01:14:08.400
because I'm so
fucking powerless.

1377
01:14:10.315 --> 01:14:12.839
The most frightening part
is that...

1378
01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:15.015
I'm about to find out
if that dance

1379
01:14:15.146 --> 01:14:17.975
meant as much to him
as it did to me.

1380
01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:23.850
Or if I'm just another
goddamn Tuesday.

1381
01:14:23.981 --> 01:14:26.026
No. you're more like
a Thursday. madame.

1382
01:14:28.551 --> 01:14:31.205
Have I always
been this adolescent?

1383
01:14:31.336 --> 01:14:34.426
No. Only when it's raining.

1384
01:14:36.994 --> 01:14:40.650
One. two. three. four. five.
six. seven. eight.

1385
01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.999
One.

1386
01:14:42.129 --> 01:14:43.087
Mike.

1387
01:14:45.045 --> 01:14:47.047
Uh. Jack. keep taking
them through.

1388
01:14:52.183 --> 01:14:54.359
What the fuck you mean
"we're done"?

1389
01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:59.059
I'm sorry. I did my best.
but I failed.

1390
01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:01.105
-Wait. What-- All right.
-Victor will come back

1391
01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:02.628
and pick you up.

1392
01:15:02.759 --> 01:15:04.151
and he can arrange
a flight for you tomorrow.

1393
01:15:04.282 --> 01:15:06.414
No. no. no. What happened?
This isn't you.

1394
01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:07.981
What the fuck is going on
with you. Max?

1395
01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:13.857
Nothing.

1396
01:15:13.987 --> 01:15:16.512
What? Un-fucking-believable.

1397
01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:19.645
You really are the Queen of
the First Act. huh? Holy shit.

1398
01:15:22.605 --> 01:15:23.867
You don't know
anything about me.

1399
01:15:23.997 --> 01:15:25.912
And you don't
understand anything.

1400
01:15:26.043 --> 01:15:27.523
It's Friday.

1401
01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:30.221
They wouldn't pull the plug
on us until Monday.

1402
01:15:30.351 --> 01:15:32.005
But you're walking away.

1403
01:15:32.136 --> 01:15:34.138
You have no show.

1404
01:15:34.268 --> 01:15:36.270
You couldn't even come up
with an ending.

1405
01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:38.098
You cannot say that
what we've created so far

1406
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:39.622
isn't fucking special.

1407
01:15:39.752 --> 01:15:41.624
You cannot say that.
I know you can't.

1408
01:15:46.454 --> 01:15:50.371
I'm sorry. but we're gonna
have to let it go.

1409
01:15:52.765 --> 01:15:54.593
You'll still get paid.

1410
01:15:54.724 --> 01:15:57.727
Hey! Hey. look. I don't give
a fuck about the money.

1411
01:15:57.857 --> 01:15:59.119
I don't fucking care.

1412
01:15:59.685 --> 01:16:01.165
Okay?

1413
01:16:01.295 --> 01:16:02.862
We're good at this
and I'm not gonna

1414
01:16:02.993 --> 01:16:04.690
fucking just let us
give up on it.

1415
01:16:04.821 --> 01:16:06.083
You're so good at this.

1416
01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:12.785
I bet you he never cared about
what you were good at. Did he?

1417
01:16:17.224 --> 01:16:18.878
Don't let this be the end.

1418
01:16:25.842 --> 01:16:26.843
Uh. Uh.

1419
01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:07.623
-Woody!
-Lay it on me. gov.

1420
01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:09.668
I need a plumber
and a ballerina.

1421
01:17:11.539 --> 01:17:14.412
The princess
is on a hunger strike.

1422
01:17:14.542 --> 01:17:15.935
Won't even open the door.

1423
01:17:16.066 --> 01:17:17.284
What? She's not even drinking?

1424
01:17:17.415 --> 01:17:18.938
I'm afraid not.

1425
01:17:19.069 --> 01:17:21.549
Did you try using your
"wise British butler" voice?

1426
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.380
Trust me. I went full metal
Downton Abbey on her ass.

1427
01:17:26.511 --> 01:17:29.645
And if that bloke doesn't pull
his head from his own ass...

1428
01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:32.038
you'll be parented
from behind a closed door

1429
01:17:32.169 --> 01:17:34.127
for months. Years. even.

1430
01:17:34.258 --> 01:17:37.000
But you didn't tell her
you slipped Mike the keys?

1431
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:38.871
Please.

1432
01:17:39.002 --> 01:17:41.657
If the lawyers found out
her careless manservant...

1433
01:17:41.787 --> 01:17:43.267
failed to lock
The Rattigan doors.

1434
01:17:43.397 --> 01:17:45.573
she'll need
plausible deniability.

1435
01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:47.184
If there's anything
I've learned.

1436
01:17:47.314 --> 01:17:49.186
it's that you can't tell
people anything.

1437
01:17:49.316 --> 01:17:50.927
They have to have
an experience.

1438
01:17:54.017 --> 01:17:55.148
Message from Mike.

1439
01:17:56.759 --> 01:17:58.108
"End is not ending.

1440
01:17:58.238 --> 01:18:00.545
"Sunday at- 00 we roll.
The Grand Finale."

1441
01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:01.851
Let me see that.

1442
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:06.290
Crikey. it's a haiku.

1443
01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:10.207
Seventeen syllables
in a five-seven-five pattern.

1444
01:18:10.337 --> 01:18:12.688
Purely coincidence.
but still...

1445
01:18:12.818 --> 01:18:14.646
there's hope for him
after all.

1446
01:18:14.777 --> 01:18:17.344
Sounds like Sunday's
gonna be an experience.

1447
01:18:17.475 --> 01:18:19.825
Doesn't it just?

1448
01:20:04.016 --> 01:20:05.583
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1449
01:20:09.195 --> 01:20:10.240
Follow me.

1450
01:20:22.295 --> 01:20:24.210
Put some clothes on. Maxandra.

1451
01:20:27.431 --> 01:20:29.085
Why would I do that?

1452
01:20:29.215 --> 01:20:30.521
We have to go.

1453
01:20:32.566 --> 01:20:33.916
Where?

1454
01:20:34.046 --> 01:20:35.308
You know where.

1455
01:20:40.661 --> 01:20:42.185
-He didn't.
-He did.

1456
01:20:42.315 --> 01:20:44.448
No. he didn't.

1457
01:20:44.578 --> 01:20:49.061
Oh. my God. Oh. my God. No.
No. it's gonna be a disaster.

1458
01:20:49.192 --> 01:20:50.410
No. it's not.

1459
01:20:50.541 --> 01:20:52.064
Oh. it's going to be
a disaster.

1460
01:20:52.195 --> 01:20:53.761
No. no. no. I can't. I can't.
Uh. uh. no.

1461
01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:55.198
-Yes. you can.
-No. I can't go.

1462
01:20:55.328 --> 01:20:56.590
Come on.

1463
01:20:56.721 --> 01:20:58.288
No. I won't go
and you can't make me.

1464
01:20:58.418 --> 01:20:59.680
Mom.

1465
01:21:01.552 --> 01:21:02.858
We have to go.

1466
01:21:28.753 --> 01:21:30.886
Here you go. There.

1467
01:21:31.016 --> 01:21:32.278
Victor.

1468
01:21:35.455 --> 01:21:36.935
The rumors
about the show

1469
01:21:37.066 --> 01:21:39.416
were a form of entertainment
for some.

1470
01:21:39.546 --> 01:21:41.853
But for the two people
who created it.

1471
01:21:41.984 --> 01:21:43.724
the terror of
the opening night

1472
01:21:43.855 --> 01:21:45.683
could only be managed
by remembering

1473
01:21:45.813 --> 01:21:47.903
there would be
no record of it.

1474
01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:51.428
Only the people who were
there would ever experience

1475
01:21:51.558 --> 01:21:55.040
the story of Max and Mike
as told through dance.

1476
01:21:55.171 --> 01:21:56.650
There's small ships.
there's tall ships.

1477
01:21:56.781 --> 01:21:58.435
there're ships
that sail the sea...

1478
01:21:58.565 --> 01:21:59.871
there's no ships
like friendships.

1479
01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:02.395
so here's to you and me.
One. two. three.

1480
01:22:02.526 --> 01:22:03.831
Let's go.

1481
01:22:03.962 --> 01:22:05.311
We are strippers!

1482
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:07.618
Whoo!

1483
01:22:23.373 --> 01:22:24.461
All right. man.

1484
01:22:24.591 --> 01:22:26.332
-Let's go.
-Yes.

1485
01:22:26.463 --> 01:22:29.466
Break a leg. everyone.
Alex. cue one and sound. Go.

1486
01:22:41.217 --> 01:22:42.392
The light is different.

1487
01:22:43.871 --> 01:22:45.395
It's November. It's lower.

1488
01:22:50.617 --> 01:22:51.923
Harold's worried about lunch.

1489
01:22:52.054 --> 01:22:53.620
He said the menu
is diabolical.

1490
01:22:53.751 --> 01:22:55.971
The menu is diabolical?

1491
01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:57.668
How can a menu be diabolical?

1492
01:22:57.798 --> 01:22:59.844
Only a person
can be diabolical.

1493
01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:01.498
A menu isn't alive.

1494
01:23:01.628 --> 01:23:03.021
Well. either way.
he's worried.

1495
01:23:03.152 --> 01:23:04.544
And you're worried about him?

1496
01:23:04.675 --> 01:23:06.242
I don't envy him finding out.

1497
01:23:06.372 --> 01:23:08.287
-Well. I'll tell him.
-Isabel. no. It's impossible.

1498
01:23:08.418 --> 01:23:10.159
-He has to know.
-He can never know.

1499
01:23:11.551 --> 01:23:12.552
Harold.

1500
01:23:13.771 --> 01:23:16.339
Hello. darling. Walter.

1501
01:23:17.818 --> 01:23:19.124
Drinks?

1502
01:23:19.255 --> 01:23:20.691
Will you still be
going to Calais?

1503
01:23:20.821 --> 01:23:23.694
No. I've decided
to spend the summer here.

1504
01:23:23.824 --> 01:23:26.697
You see. Isabel is pregnant.

1505
01:23:26.827 --> 01:23:29.047
Oh. Congratulations.

1506
01:23:29.178 --> 01:23:31.658
Yes.
We are very pleased.

1507
01:23:31.789 --> 01:23:34.183
We are hoping
to have a son. of course.

1508
01:23:34.313 --> 01:23:37.838
That way the legacy of
Chuffingham will be secure.

1509
01:23:37.969 --> 01:23:41.233
And if not.
we will keep trying.

1510
01:23:41.364 --> 01:23:44.889
One of the benefits
of having a young wife.

1511
01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.239
I'm sure Isabel
will make a wonderful mother.

1512
01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:51.200
No doubt.
And of course my mother

1513
01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:53.202
will be here to help.

1514
01:23:53.332 --> 01:23:54.855
Unicorn! Unicorn! Unicorn!

1515
01:24:04.256 --> 01:24:05.866
- Hello. Lady Isabel.

1516
01:24:05.997 --> 01:24:07.477
Unicorn?

1517
01:24:07.607 --> 01:24:12.047
Why. yes. it's me. Unicorn.
Did you call for me?

1518
01:24:12.177 --> 01:24:15.572
Yeah. but I didn't expect you
to show up out of the blue.

1519
01:24:15.702 --> 01:24:16.877
I haven't spoken
to my imaginary friend

1520
01:24:17.008 --> 01:24:18.053
since I was a child.

1521
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:21.491
Am I okay?

1522
01:24:21.621 --> 01:24:23.188
Hmm. well. that depends

1523
01:24:23.319 --> 01:24:25.277
on what your definition
of okay is

1524
01:24:25.408 --> 01:24:27.975
but first things first.

1525
01:24:28.106 --> 01:24:30.108
why don't you tell us
how you really feel.

1526
01:24:43.252 --> 01:24:44.644
Well...

1527
01:24:47.212 --> 01:24:48.213
I don't know.

1528
01:24:50.346 --> 01:24:53.044
These two guys shouldn't be
my only two options

1529
01:24:53.175 --> 01:24:55.090
in the world. should they?

1530
01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:59.572
I mean. why do I even need
to feel like I choose?

1531
01:24:59.703 --> 01:25:02.227
Like. it's between
the shitty rich guy

1532
01:25:02.358 --> 01:25:04.011
and the poor guy
with a heart of gold.

1533
01:25:04.142 --> 01:25:07.493
I mean. come on.
all I really want right now

1534
01:25:07.624 --> 01:25:09.016
is to tell these boring

1535
01:25:09.147 --> 01:25:12.846
bags of dicks
to leave me alone!

1536
01:25:15.849 --> 01:25:17.808
That's right.
Lady Isabel.

1537
01:25:17.938 --> 01:25:19.331
See. I'm here to tell you

1538
01:25:19.462 --> 01:25:21.203
that you can have
anything you want.

1539
01:25:21.333 --> 01:25:23.857
All you have to do is ask.

1540
01:25:23.988 --> 01:25:27.687
What? Okay. Really?

1541
01:25:28.819 --> 01:25:31.082
-Really.
-Okay.

1542
01:25:31.213 --> 01:25:36.566
Well. I am a modest lady.
so...

1543
01:25:36.696 --> 01:25:39.699
what if all I wanted
was just a guy

1544
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:41.658
in a tank top and some jeans?

1545
01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:51.624
Okay. well.
if I can have that then...

1546
01:25:51.755 --> 01:25:53.322
what about a bad boy--

1547
01:25:53.452 --> 01:25:55.150
hold up. hold up--

1548
01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.108
who always responds
to my texts.

1549
01:25:59.545 --> 01:26:02.287
Ooh. All right.

1550
01:26:02.418 --> 01:26:07.249
And now.
if I can have that then...

1551
01:26:07.379 --> 01:26:12.167
a sexy CEO who pays his
women more than his men!

1552
01:26:14.081 --> 01:26:16.432
-Ooh. me-ow.

1553
01:26:16.562 --> 01:26:18.477
What about a guy with a puppy?

1554
01:26:24.091 --> 01:26:26.268
Okay. let me just swallow
my saliva

1555
01:26:26.398 --> 01:26:28.444
that's literally dripping out
of my mouth right now.

1556
01:26:28.574 --> 01:26:31.273
If I could have all of that.
why stop there?

1557
01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.068
Wait a minute.

1558
01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:47.202
I can't be the only person
in this room

1559
01:26:47.332 --> 01:26:48.942
to feel what I'm feeling
right now. Am I?

1560
01:26:49.073 --> 01:26:50.335
No!

1561
01:26:50.466 --> 01:26:51.771
I didn't think so.

1562
01:26:51.902 --> 01:26:54.209
I can tell by the looks
on your faces.

1563
01:26:54.339 --> 01:26:57.603
Now I want every single one
of you to know

1564
01:26:57.734 --> 01:27:01.303
how I'm feeling
right this very second.

1565
01:27:01.433 --> 01:27:04.262
I managed to have
a little bit of everything.

1566
01:27:04.393 --> 01:27:07.744
And now. it's your turn.

1567
01:27:07.874 --> 01:27:11.400
So. by the power vested in me
through this Magic Mike...

1568
01:27:11.530 --> 01:27:16.666
I command thee. Unicorn.
send everything to us all

1569
01:27:16.796 --> 01:27:18.755
right now!

1570
01:28:44.362 --> 01:28:45.320
Uh...

1571
01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:10.736

How do you feel about

1578
01:29:55.868 --> 01:30:00.656
Make some bloody noise.

1579
01:30:00.786 --> 01:30:04.747
Give it up. Give it up

1580

who busted into a sweat
just for all of you.

1581
01:30:08.272 --> 01:30:10.187
Come on. make a little noise.

1582
01:30:12.276 --> 01:30:15.148
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1583
01:30:15.279 --> 01:30:18.761
That's what I like to hear.
That's what I love to hear.

1584
01:30:18.891 --> 01:30:20.719
A little bit of noise
on this stage

1585
01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:22.808
doesn't go amiss. sweethearts.

1586
01:30:22.939 --> 01:30:26.638
And let me tell you one thing.
a body at rest...

1587
01:30:26.769 --> 01:30:29.206
is a body at rest. Right?

1588
01:30:29.336 --> 01:30:32.992
Eh. you know. not bad.
But a body in motion...

1589
01:30:36.605 --> 01:30:41.697
There is absolutely
nothing sexier...

1590
01:30:41.827 --> 01:30:44.439
than a body in motion.
Am I right?

1591
01:30:48.704 --> 01:30:52.011
So for our next act.
I want you to give it up...

1592
01:30:52.142 --> 01:30:53.317
ladies and gentlemen

1593
01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:56.799
for the trickster prince
him bloody self.

1594
01:30:56.929 --> 01:31:02.021
Give it up. everybody.
for Mr. JD Rainey.

"
by James Brown plays]

1596
01:34:48.117 --> 01:34:50.380
-I think we should leave now.
-Where are we going?

1597
01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:51.947
Mike said to leave
at the end of "Suits"

1598
01:34:52.077 --> 01:34:53.296
and return
at the end of "Pony."

1599
01:34:53.426 --> 01:34:55.211
Oh. yes. yes. So you go.

1600
01:34:55.341 --> 01:34:59.345
And no peeking.
He'll be watching you.

1601
01:34:59.476 --> 01:35:02.392
Now folks.
this next dance

1602
01:35:02.522 --> 01:35:05.308
is one that
I'm well-acquainted with.

1603
01:35:05.438 --> 01:35:09.660
Things are about
to get intimate.

1604
01:35:12.576 --> 01:35:17.102
Now. a real man isn't afraid
to act on his desire...

1605
01:35:17.233 --> 01:35:20.802
but the sexiest act
of submission...

1606
01:35:20.932 --> 01:35:23.892
is asking for permission.

1607
01:37:17.919 --> 01:37:19.268
-Break a leg. gov.

1608
01:37:19.398 --> 01:37:20.573
Aw. bless ya.

1609
01:37:36.067 --> 01:37:38.069
I know. I know.

1610
01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.637
We all want
a little bit of everything

1611
01:37:40.767 --> 01:37:42.857
all of the time. Don't we?

1612
01:37:42.987 --> 01:37:44.249
But...

1613
01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:47.513
sometimes you just want to be

1614
01:37:47.644 --> 01:37:51.343
everything to someone. Right?

1615
01:37:53.519 --> 01:37:58.046
Sometimes. the greatest
fantasy of them all...

1616
01:37:58.176 --> 01:38:00.265
is knowing
that you're the only one.

1617
01:43:22.631 --> 01:43:24.763
You said to go hard.
and so I did what you said.

1618
01:43:24.894 --> 01:43:25.982
I mean. you know.

1619
01:43:26.112 --> 01:43:27.070
Oh. God.

1620
01:43:27.201 --> 01:43:28.158
We showed up.

1621
01:43:34.904 --> 01:43:35.948
That's "Pony."

1622
01:43:36.079 --> 01:43:37.254
Mike said after "Pony."

1623
01:43:37.385 --> 01:43:39.169
No. he just said "Pony."

1624
01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:41.040
He definitely said
after "Pony"

1625
01:43:41.171 --> 01:43:43.173
and they're still
on their ponies. Now sit.

1626
01:44:34.311 --> 01:44:35.269
Yes!

1627
01:44:45.366 --> 01:44:47.411
Come on. they're applauding.
It must be over now.

1628
01:44:47.542 --> 01:44:48.760
Very well.

1629
01:45:06.909 --> 01:45:08.737
So amazing.

1630
01:45:14.133 --> 01:45:16.005
Wait a minute. Just a second.

1631
01:45:16.135 --> 01:45:17.702
Thank you very much. Mr. Mike.

1632
01:45:17.833 --> 01:45:19.095
Very nice. my friend.

1633
01:45:37.592 --> 01:45:39.550
-You look beautiful.
-Congratulations.

1634
01:45:39.681 --> 01:45:42.205
-Huh?
-Congratulations. You did it.

1635
01:45:42.336 --> 01:45:43.337
What are you talking about?
We did it.

1636
01:45:43.467 --> 01:45:44.816
You did it. It was amazing.

1637
01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:45.861
Look around.
All this is because of you.

1638
01:45:45.904 --> 01:45:47.210
You are sublime.

1639
01:45:47.341 --> 01:45:48.907
Look. I just want you to know
I love you. Okay?

1640
01:45:55.174 --> 01:45:56.480
Wait. Wait. wait. wait.

1641
01:45:56.611 --> 01:45:57.873
If you're not gonna leave him.

1642
01:45:58.003 --> 01:46:00.136
I don't want this
to be more confusing.

1643
01:46:00.266 --> 01:46:05.097
It's done. I'm never. ever.
ever going back to him.

1644
01:46:05.228 --> 01:46:08.579
I am free and I am broke.

1645
01:46:08.710 --> 01:46:11.843
What do you mean? You're--
What do you mean you're broke?

1646
01:46:11.974 --> 01:46:13.715
-Yeah.
-Like broke. broke?

1647
01:46:15.369 --> 01:46:17.501
I'm s-- I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1648
01:46:17.632 --> 01:46:19.024
It's okay. I don't care.

1649
01:46:19.155 --> 01:46:22.724
No. I'm-- I'm just--
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1650
01:46:31.689 --> 01:46:32.821
I hate you.

1651
01:46:39.697 --> 01:46:41.438
Come on. let's go.

1652
01:46:45.964 --> 01:46:47.575
No one can claim

1653
01:46:47.705 --> 01:46:50.578
to fully understand
what exactly dance is...

1654
01:46:50.708 --> 01:46:52.406
but what is abundantly clear

1655
01:46:52.536 --> 01:46:56.105
is that dance seeks
no meaning for its desires.

1656
01:46:56.235 --> 01:47:00.675
It does not value age
or status. logic or reason.

1657
01:47:00.805 --> 01:47:04.113
It is a compass orientated
only to liberty.

1658
01:47:04.243 --> 01:47:05.984
not unlike the human heart.

1659
01:47:06.115 --> 01:47:07.986
I stumbled upon these wisdoms

1660
01:47:08.117 --> 01:47:12.426
when I met a lonely stripper
named Mike.
