about. like. how I didn't fit into society
or something. [chuckles]

to music like that.

that. like. hits these. like. deep parts
of the human psyche.

I think being a songwriter is actually.
like. the best job and the best craft.

[Rodrigo] So much of the album was written
between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles.

87
00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:54.748
And so I thought it would be fun
to do a road trip one last time.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:58.501
I wanna play the songs in these places
that meant so much to me.

90
00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.313
I remember posting
the song "happier" online

91
00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:21.733
and looking back on it and being like.
"Oh. my God. This song is terrible.

92
00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:25.945
It got no likes. I sang it really badly.
Why did I do that?"

93
00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:31.826
But I had this. like.
gut feeling to keep it up.

94
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:38.333
That feeling served me well. 'cause
that song changed everything for me.

95
00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.921
The fact that I posted it
was the reason that I met Dan

96
00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:44.881
'cause he found it and was like.

97
00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:47.092
"Oh. my God. I love this song.
We should work together."

98
00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:52.055
That was the first song that
we produced together. was-- was "happier."

[Rodrigo] This relationship was definitely
like the heartbreak that kept on giving.

127
00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:19.017
[laughs] It was like I was
in the situation where I had to see him.

128
00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:23.313
He was with someone else. which was…

Nobody understood how I was feeling
or related to it.

131
00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:40.163
And so I think by writing songs
about exactly how I felt.

I was creating. like. a friend for me.

133
00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:57.347
"jealousy. jealousy" was
the second song I wrote for the album.

134
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.599
And I remember writing it in a time

135
00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:03.353
where I was just so obsessed
with social media in a very negative way.

136

A very highly anticipated achievement.

249
00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:11.966
All my relatives called
to congratulate me.

250
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.220
I realized part of the reason
I wanted to get my license so bad

251
00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.931
was because of this boy.

252
00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:20.809
I always felt bad about being too young
to drive over to see him.

253
00:18:20.892 --> 00:18:22.644
too young to have any real freedom.

254
00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:25.063
I thought he should be
with a girl who had those liberties.

255
00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:28.692
I feel his hold on me loosen more
and more lately. That's a lovely feeling.

256
00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:32.195
I'm still very much not able to fall
for anyone else though.

257

I can't even fathom it at the moment."

258
00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:40.870

that it might be something special.

260
00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:47.669

just really captured devastation

261
00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.088

that I hadn't been able to capture before.

to your house or whatever.

266
00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:06.563
But I remember at that time I was really.
like. reconciling with the fact

267
00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.732
that sometimes.
when you love a person so much

268
00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:11.151
and you spend so much time with them.

269
00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:13.570
like. that's who you feel the most
at home with.

270
00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:17.073
And I remember listening to that song.
even when I hadn't put it out.

271
00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:20.618

and I'd drive around and listen to it.

272

my stomach would drop

273
00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:24.164

275
00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:38.386

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:02.160
And how do you transform that
into something like a song?

286
00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:06.456
I don't know. For me and. like.
my style of songwriting and music is

287
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:10.210
sometimes it gets a little overwhelming.

288
00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:13.046
I think that sometimes storytelling
doesn't necessarily have to come

289
00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:14.964
-from a place of devastation.
-Yes.

290

for the rest of my career.

361
00:24:55.453 --> 00:24:58.498
[Rodrigo] The success of "drivers license"
changed everything.

362
00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:03.211
I went from performing it alone
in my bedroom or in the studio with Dan

363
00:25:03.294 --> 00:25:07.382
to performing it live in these super high-
stakes environments for the first time.

364
00:25:08.216 --> 00:25:09.426
It was very intense.

365
00:25:18.977 --> 00:25:21.438
Having a big song like that.
you put it out and you're also like.

366
00:25:21.521 --> 00:25:22.647
"Oh. my God. this is amazing."

367
00:25:22.731 --> 00:25:26.109
And then everyone's like. "What's next?
Can you follow it up? What's coming next?"

368
00:25:26.192 --> 00:25:29.320
And you're like.
"Jesus. like… [chuckles] …I just did this.

369
00:25:29.404 --> 00:25:31.489
Like. can-- can't this be enough?"

370
00:25:32.157 --> 00:25:35.368
Did we talk about making an album?
Did I run that by you?

371
00:25:35.452 --> 00:25:36.870
-No. No. you didn't.
-No?

372
00:25:36.953 --> 00:25:39.039
You didn't talk to me about it.
You just. like. literally--

373
00:25:39.122 --> 00:25:41.332
I just was like. "I'm making an album.
You wanna do it. Dan?"

374
00:25:41.416 --> 00:25:43.585
It was just like. "Hey. we're going.
We're making an album."

375
00:25:43.668 --> 00:25:48.048
I remember you called me stressed out
in Salt Lake City one day.

376
00:25:48.131 --> 00:25:50.258
And you were just like.
"You gotta come here now."

377
00:25:50.342 --> 00:25:53.303
And I was like. "Oh. okay.
All right. Let's go. Let's do it."

378
00:25:53.386 --> 00:25:56.890
I probably made the call to my label
that I wanted to make an album

379
00:25:56.973 --> 00:25:58.683
like a week
after "drivers license" came out.

380
00:25:58.767 --> 00:26:02.771
I was like. "Oh. shoot. Like.
there are gonna be so many more people

381
00:26:02.854 --> 00:26:05.815
that are listening to this music
than I initially thought.

382
00:26:05.899 --> 00:26:07.650
And I really wanna put
my best foot forward."

383
00:26:07.734 --> 00:26:09.944
Made the call. and they were all.
"I don't know about that."

384
00:26:10.028 --> 00:26:12.947
But I was. like.
so dead set and determined.

391
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:44.104
♪ When she's with you
Do you get déjà vu? ♪

392
00:26:44.187 --> 00:26:47.190
In this album.
and in "deja vu" in particular.

393
00:26:47.273 --> 00:26:50.402
I'm. like. very obsessed
and. like. weirded out

394
00:26:50.485 --> 00:26:53.571
with the idea of all relationships
just being so recycled.

395
00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:56.991
'Cause I think I was just learning about
relationships and love for the first time.

396
00:26:57.075 --> 00:26:59.202
And I was. "Wait. none of it is special.

397
00:26:59.285 --> 00:27:00.954
Like. it happens over and over and over."

398
00:27:02.622 --> 00:27:04.874
When Dan and I wrote "deja vu" together.

399
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:09.546
we really wanted to write a song
that was really vivid and specific.

400
00:27:09.629 --> 00:27:11.506
And I think
"deja vu" really accomplishes that.

401
00:27:11.589 --> 00:27:14.384
Especially in the verses.
Really paints a picture.

402
00:27:14.467 --> 00:27:17.512
And I think specificity
and also authenticity

403
00:27:17.595 --> 00:27:20.098
are my two favorite things
that a song can have.

404
00:27:20.181 --> 00:27:22.392
And I learned that
from country music. I think.

405
00:27:22.475 --> 00:27:25.020
I think country music songs are always
very specific and authentic.

406
00:27:25.103 --> 00:27:27.689
and I think that's why they're
so heartbreaking sometimes.

407
00:27:27.772 --> 00:27:29.983
If I write a song
and it doesn't have those things.

408
00:27:30.066 --> 00:27:31.860
I generally don't really love it.

409
00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:41.619
I. to be completely honest.

410
00:27:41.703 --> 00:27:43.913
did not wanna put this song out
after "drivers license."

411
00:27:43.997 --> 00:27:46.332
I remember thinking it was a bad song.

412
00:27:46.416 --> 00:27:49.044
and I didn't like it.
and no one's going to like it.

413
00:27:49.544 --> 00:27:53.965
And I remember. like. calling my manager
like three. four days

414
00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:57.010
before we announced "deja vu"
was coming out and being like.

415
00:27:57.093 --> 00:27:59.929
"Pull the plug. I don't want to do it.
I can't do it. I hate it."

416
00:28:00.013 --> 00:28:01.306
I like the song now.

417
00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:04.642
but "drivers license" was obviously
so well received.

418
00:28:04.726 --> 00:28:08.438
The thought of coming out
with another song. that was fairly scary.

419
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:11.191
"deja vu" was a completely different song
than "drivers license" too.

420
00:28:11.274 --> 00:28:12.525
in every single way.

421
00:28:13.068 --> 00:28:17.697
There was so much drama that was
around "drivers license" and so much hate.

422
00:28:17.781 --> 00:28:19.741
I. like. thought if I put this song out.

423
00:28:19.824 --> 00:28:25.080
then I was also. like. playing into this.
like. drama. love triangle.

424
00:28:25.163 --> 00:28:28.333
like. "let's hate on other girls" thing.
and I just did not wanna do that.

425
00:28:28.416 --> 00:28:31.878
And that was-- I never write any
of my songs from that point of view

426
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:33.588
'cause that's not something that I feel.

427
00:28:33.672 --> 00:28:36.299
I feel like I've given so many notes.
It's just the same notes.

428
00:28:36.383 --> 00:28:38.718
Just in my head about it.
I'm just always gonna find things.

429
00:28:38.802 --> 00:28:40.595
I need to pull the trigger and do it.

430
00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:43.390
[Morris on phone] If it makes you
feel any better. I am the same way.

484
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:39.793
I was thinking a lot about this idea of.
in order to get over a heartbreak.

485
00:32:39.876 --> 00:32:42.462
I think you have to forgive
that person who caused you pain.

486
00:32:42.545 --> 00:32:45.674
but I think also a big part of it
is forgiving yourself.

487
00:32:48.385 --> 00:32:53.515
I found this little poem
that I wrote in my Notes app on my phone.

488
00:32:53.598 --> 00:32:56.643
"I know that I loved you so bad.
I let you treat me like that."

489
00:32:57.894 --> 00:32:59.813
I really liked that.
I thought it grabbed you.

00:32:59.896 --> 00:33:01.898

like crazy.

[Rodrigo chuckles]

665
00:43:59.764 --> 00:44:00.765
Being a child actor.

666
00:44:00.849 --> 00:44:03.351
where you're constantly told
everything you do is amazing.

667
00:44:03.435 --> 00:44:06.354
you did the bare minimum and they're like.
"Oh. you're a star."

668
00:44:08.064 --> 00:44:10.442
And I was always. like.
really disillusioned by that

669
00:44:10.525 --> 00:44:11.526
from a very young age.

670
00:44:11.609 --> 00:44:13.778
I was like.
"They're just gonna tell me whatever."

671
00:44:13.862 --> 00:44:17.032
And so. I kind of. like.
went to the other side of the spectrum.

672
00:44:17.115 --> 00:44:19.826
and started thinking
that everything that I did was really bad.

673
00:44:19.909 --> 00:44:22.245
And started being. like. my own critic
and being like.

674
00:44:22.328 --> 00:44:24.456
"No. you can always do better.
Always do better."

675
00:44:24.539 --> 00:44:27.042
Never accepted when anyone told me
that I did a good job.

676
00:44:27.959 --> 00:44:31.796
I remember really gravitating
towards my dad in that time

677
00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.216
'cause he was the only person
who I felt. like. would tell me the truth.

678
00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.219
and that was really hard
for me to grapple with at a young age.

679
00:44:38.303 --> 00:44:39.763
feeling like you couldn't trust anyone

680
00:44:39.846 --> 00:44:42.349
and no one was gonna tell you
if you were messing up.

681
00:44:44.601 --> 00:44:46.603
I also think Dan is like that for me too.

682
00:44:46.686 --> 00:44:49.105
Dan's very much someone in my life

683
00:44:49.189 --> 00:44:52.067
who will be. like. unabashedly like.

684
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:54.819
"No. you shouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that if I were you."

685
00:44:54.903 --> 00:44:56.404
Which I. like. really appreciate.

686
00:44:56.488 --> 00:44:59.657
'cause not a lot of people care enough
to be honest with people.

687

You know what I mean?

688
00:45:00.825 --> 00:45:03.411
I think there's a certain level of care
and kindness

689

to. like. help someone like that.
