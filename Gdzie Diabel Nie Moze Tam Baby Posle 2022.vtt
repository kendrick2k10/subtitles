3
00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.416
It was a man's world.

4
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.416
The roles were assigned.
The cards were dealt.

5
00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:57.083
Men made the big money.

6
00:00:57.416 --> 00:00:59.958
We women kept in the background

7
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.583
and we were fine with it.

8
00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:02.458
Ten dollars!

9
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.541
Such were the times.

10
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:06.125
When I met Antek. he was
my professor at university.

11
00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:08.833
He dated my friend Helena.

12
00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:10.375
I was deeply impressed.

13
00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:13.416
I had no idea what he did after hours.

14
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.791
This is what I told you about.

15
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.583
Splendid.

16
00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:20.875
A Red dragon?

17
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.833
Careful! It's an 18th century icon.

18
00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:30.666
Full discretion as discussed.

19
00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:35.000
It disappeared from police evidence.
so they won't look for it.

20
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:37.250
Would be embarrassing.

21
00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:50.041
This is what I told you about.

22
00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:57.666
Careful! It's a 18th century work of art!

23
00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.416
Do you know what this is?

24
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.083
They say it's all about
the right time and place.

25
00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:04.184
12 December 1981 11:50 pm
10 minutes before the martial law

26
00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:07.375
The partners were about
to meet at a historic time –

27
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.833
the introduction or martial law in Poland.

28
00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:14.083
It's the story of the first Polish fortunes.

29
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:16.541
And I was there to watch
how they made their millions.

30
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.750
Gentlemen.

31
00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:21.166
you are under arrest for fencing.

32
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.250
Fencing?

33
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.666
I can explain.

34
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.208
Did you sell this icon?

35
00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:29.125
I did.

36
00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:30.416
But it's not stolen.

37
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.458
He claimed it came from police evidence.

38
00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:36.083
Badmouthing the state police?

39
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:38.958
You're under arrest.
Take him away.

40
00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:41.333
The work of generations…

41
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:43.958
What is this Muppet show?

42
00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:46.000
…is being laid to ruins.

43
00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:49.333
Key areas stop functioning.

44
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.583
The dwindling economy…

45
00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:54.000
That's what rock-stars do in the West.

46
00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:55.250
Open the window!

47
00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:57.958
Kazik!

48
00:02:58.125 --> 00:02:59.916
Kazik! Kazik!

49
00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:05.125
Off you go!

50
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:12.625
This is how Kazimierz Bączek rocks!

51
00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:16.708
Kazimierz Bączek. A janitor. currency dealer
and small time crook.

52
00:03:17.083 --> 00:03:20.333
Protected by the deal he struck
with state security.

53
00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:22.083
Do you know what you did?

54
00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:24.000
I killed a man with a TV-set.

55
00:03:24.541 --> 00:03:25.541
Worse.

56
00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:28.083
You killed a state security agent!

57
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.333
What's the penalty?

58
00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:32.875
Death.

59
00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:36.958
I am so sorry.

60
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.666
These things happen.

61
00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:43.291
- Is there no other solution?
- Sign this.

62
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.458
And never mention any of this again.

63
00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:53.625
I'll sign anything.

64
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.666
What's in it for me?

65
00:03:56.916 --> 00:03:58.541
Colonel Starczewski.

66
00:03:58.625 --> 00:03:59.666
A true villain.

67
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.291
Military intelligence.

68
00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:04.750
He was like the mafia.
spinning his web.

69
00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:13.000
Do you know this man?

70
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:16.083
Barely. Small-time crook.

71
00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:18.000
You are best friends now.

72
00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:20.250
Everything you see.

73
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.500
everything you find out…

74
00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:22.625
Know what I mean?

75
00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:26.958
I'm so sorry!

76
00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.166
There you are!

77
00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:29.666
I was worried sick!

78
00:04:29.708 --> 00:04:30.708
There's war!

79
00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:33.916
Curfew after 10 pm. the phones are off.

80
00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:35.750
I'm so happy they let you go.

81
00:04:35.916 --> 00:04:38.250
Nobody would to talk to me.

82
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.083
Well. you know…

83
00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:43.375
Through Antek. Bączek met Komar.

84
00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:44.250
Good day!

85
00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:45.416
A famous tennis player

86
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.500
and party animal.

87
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.875
In reality he was most famous for

88
00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.208
running luxury escorts.

89
00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:55.458
Allow me to introduce
doctor Antoni Kafer!

90
00:04:56.541 --> 00:05:01.083
Artist and Art school faculty.

91
00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:05.583
- Maestro Antoni Kafer!
- That should fire up my ego.

92
00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:08.375
And yet you're still idling.

93
00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:09.458
Better than misfiring.

94
00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:10.833
We've met.

95
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.708
It's good to see you.
I need more.

96
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.750
No problem.

97
00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.625
Are you Antoni's friend?

98
00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:21.041
Please. join us.

99
00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:24.333
Friends of friends are also my friends.

100
00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:27.000
The three musketeers were soon
joined by a fourth one.

101
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.041
The son of a general in the Polish Army.

102
00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:31.208
Karol Lis.

103
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.958
Also under colonel Starczewski's umbrella.

104
00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:36.791
Will she remain your wife after she
learns of your indiscretions?

105
00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.083
How do you know?

106
00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:40.000
The wives were not stupid.

107
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:41.041
They knew.

108
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.583
They had their reasons not to leave.

109
00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:46.125
Dorota was the toughest.

110
00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:48.875
She ran a sewing business
and was doing good.

111
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:52.375
Denim was in fashion. but it
wasn't available anywhere.

112
00:05:52.583 --> 00:05:55.291
Thank you. lieutenant.

113
00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:57.583
for this well carried out search.

114
00:05:57.625 --> 00:06:00.541
I'll gladly report your dedication
to your superiors.

115
00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:02.416
I don't understand.

116
00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:03.833
One word is enough.

117
00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:08.291
Talent can't go to waste
on such low level.

118
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.625
You could get promoted…

119
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.833
Krysia was Bączek's wife.

120
00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:13.708
I have work.

121
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.750
Well…

122
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.416
She just loved him too much.

123
00:06:17.458 --> 00:06:18.625
And he did what he wanted.

124
00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:20.083
I made you some beef tartare!

125
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:24.250
Beef tartare?
Janitors living the high life!

126
00:06:24.541 --> 00:06:26.041
Been queuing three days for the meat!

127
00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:28.250
- They sold beef. so…
- Queuing. Right…

128
00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:31.416
I always thought this was
the wrong company for Antek.

129
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:33.833
I was young. naive and very much in love.

130
00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:35.500
I resisted for a long time.

131
00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:37.875
Didn't want to be one of his flings.

132
00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:40.708
Love plays by its own rules.

133
00:06:41.041 --> 00:06:43.708
Nothing to do with rational thinking.

134
00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:45.416
Oh…

135
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.166
Is it not too late?

136
00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:54.291
Absolutely not. professor.

137
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.291
Can I come in?

138
00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:04.041
Yes. please.

139
00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:25.333
Are you painting with artificial lighting?

140
00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:28.041
It's just a touch-up.

141
00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:35.333
I only have loose-leaf…

142
00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:37.208
I'll have some.

143
00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:16.958
Compared to the Polish transformation.
the Wild West was a sandbox.

144
00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:19.791
Bączek was turning everything into money.

145
00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.375
Stolen cars. forged fuel coupons…

146
00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:23.708
This is the key.

147
00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:25.583
Tricking tourists.

148
00:08:25.708 --> 00:08:26.708
What is that?

149
00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.625
I wanted railway worker. not miner!

150
00:08:30.666 --> 00:08:33.125
It's my in-law's. The man
dreamed of being a railway worker!

151
00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:38.791
Lower the barrier.
They're coming.

152
00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:50.958
How much?

153
00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:53.125
100!

154
00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:55.458
Bitte!

155
00:08:56.833 --> 00:08:57.833
Change money?

156
00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:02.458
There's the train!

157
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.666
- We need to do something!
- Leave it!

158
00:09:09.041 --> 00:09:11.375
No. my bad! The train will let you through.

159
00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:17.500
Crooks can smell other crooks.

160
00:09:17.708 --> 00:09:20.291
And when the lieutenant didn't get promoted.

161
00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:22.791
he stuck with Bączek's group.

162
00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:25.416
I do not only business protection.

163
00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:28.250
I became a businessman myself.

164
00:09:28.541 --> 00:09:29.541
Much like you.

165
00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:31.625
I have access to wholesalers.

166
00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:34.000
If you need something. just…

167
00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:36.916
I run everything from here.

168
00:09:37.416 --> 00:09:38.416
Room 102.

169
00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:15.958
Good evening. Mr. Lis.

170
00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:17.458
What? Here?

171
00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:20.083
Are you crazy?

172
00:10:20.291 --> 00:10:24.291
Relax. I'm not on duty.

173
00:10:26.583 --> 00:10:28.250
Sorry for bothering you.

174
00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:51.416
Bravo!

175
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:04.541
If you need anything.

176
00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:09.125
Denim. threads. rivets.

177
00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:10.166
Anything.

178
00:11:11.083 --> 00:11:14.083
I run things from here. Room 102.

179
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.125
102 for denim. you say?

180
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.625
Tell him.

181
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.791
She didn't take your letter.

182
00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:22.916
Why not?

183
00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:25.083
Because she wanted to speak in person!

184
00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:32.083
How about you offer me a drink?

185
00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:34.625
Of course!

186
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.333
Vodka?

187
00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:41.083
A drink! Campari with juice.

188
00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:43.833
Can-can with juice for the lady!

189
00:11:44.333 --> 00:11:45.333
Coming up.

190
00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:48.000
How long has it been?

191
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.416
Seven years I was away.

192
00:11:53.541 --> 00:11:56.458
You're famous. Saw you at a festival.

193
00:11:58.666 --> 00:11:59.916
I wanted…

194
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.250
We could've had it all!

195
00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:05.791
All!

196
00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:07.458
I know.
I regret it.

197
00:12:10.583 --> 00:12:12.541
What about the child?

198
00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:15.250
I was 17! I wasn't ready!

199
00:12:16.416 --> 00:12:18.250
- Did you have an abortion?
- A miscarriage!

200
00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:24.125
Kazik…

201
00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:26.291
What if this is a sign?

202
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.250
Our second chance?

203
00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:33.083
Is there some place we can talk?

204
00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:38.750
There is.

205
00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:45.583
Bring the order to room 210
and put it on room 102.

206
00:12:45.708 --> 00:12:46.708
Certainly.

207
00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:48.041
Good evening.

208
00:12:48.833 --> 00:12:50.541
Are you Kazimierz Bączek?

209
00:12:52.791 --> 00:12:55.208
Did you too turn to some business?

210
00:12:58.083 --> 00:12:59.291
Here's some seed money.

211
00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:03.500
My name is Maciejak. I'm with the police.

212
00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:05.416
You're coming with us.

213
00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:07.791
Where are you taking him?

214
00:13:07.916 --> 00:13:09.541
Put this back.

215
00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:12.875
Take him away.

216
00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:14.750
That was a great performance!

217
00:13:18.166 --> 00:13:20.708
For Lis and Bączek this was nothing unusual.

218
00:13:20.916 --> 00:13:22.250
They were always dirty.

219
00:13:23.458 --> 00:13:24.666
State police!

220
00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:27.541
- Let's talk about this!
- Not this time!

221
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.666
Nice. Grab them.

222
00:13:32.416 --> 00:13:34.750
I'm only here for the denim.

223
00:13:34.875 --> 00:13:36.708
Denim? What denim?

224
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.583
He came here with the bale
and is leaving with it.

225
00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:41.875
Very well.
I'm leaving.

226
00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:43.666
You're leaving with us.

227
00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.458
Time in jail and orders from your handler.

228
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.208
Good base for a solid friendship.

229
00:13:59.291 --> 00:14:01.166
Did you see the guy who just left?

230
00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.083
You'll work together.

231
00:14:06.041 --> 00:14:07.541
You'll keep an eye on him.

232
00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:11.916
What should I do?

233
00:14:12.708 --> 00:14:14.166
What you are. Just more actively.

234
00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:16.208
More actively.

235
00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:18.875
70% of every dime you make goes to us.

236
00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:21.208
And everything will be forgotten.

237
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.500
Dorota was also very active.

238
00:14:29.666 --> 00:14:30.666
Hello?

239
00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:32.625
It's you.

240
00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:35.625
All is well. Don't worry.

241
00:14:36.916 --> 00:14:40.833
Can you call me later?
I am hiring a new seamstress.

242
00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:45.125
Do you need a lift?

243
00:14:45.208 --> 00:14:47.416
Yes! The bus stop is miles away!

244
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.166
We'll be grateful.

245
00:14:50.916 --> 00:14:52.958
I saw him inside. He's got friends.

246
00:14:53.708 --> 00:14:54.708
After you.

247
00:14:58.458 --> 00:15:00.708
Kazik felt that Karol might be useful.

248
00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:03.666
And he was right about that.

249
00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:09.958
I was gathering cards all over town.

250
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:12.041
- Where's the money?
- Safe.

251
00:15:14.208 --> 00:15:15.208
Mind you head!

252
00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:23.916
By meeting Karol and Dorota
Kazik struck gold.

253
00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:28.333
POZNAŃ. 1987

254
00:15:28.833 --> 00:15:31.666
Back then we were doing
better than most people.

255
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.333
For Bączek this wasn't enough.

256
00:15:33.416 --> 00:15:34.416
Way to go. Komar!

257
00:15:35.333 --> 00:15:36.333
Keep it up!

258
00:15:36.375 --> 00:15:38.458
He was getting increasingly greedy.

259
00:15:40.291 --> 00:15:44.416
Dorota's idea brought him
the millions he desired.

260
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:49.291
Kazik!

261
00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:50.625
Karol!

262
00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:53.041
You didn't say you'd bring Dorota!

263
00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:54.125
Hi!

264
00:15:54.541 --> 00:15:57.833
Don't you know I love tennis?

265
00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.958
What's the score?

266
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:01.791
Our champ is winning.

267
00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:06.833
Because Becker and Lendl didn't make it.

268
00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:13.666
Pour us a drink!

269
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.750
Why does a tennis player
make a good barman?

270
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:21.875
Because he can serve!

271
00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:26.250
I'll check on the juniors.

272
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:32.208
People spend their last dime
to buy decent vodka.

273
00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:36.166
We should share the state's
monopoly on vodka and taxes.

274
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.583
- None for me.
- Like the US during the prohibition.

275
00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:41.000
I like what I hear.

276
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.583
Who needs all that tax money?

277
00:16:44.708 --> 00:16:45.875
It's all a waste!

278
00:16:45.916 --> 00:16:46.916
That's right.

279
00:16:47.375 --> 00:16:49.458
A sea of taxes!

280
00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:53.000
Let's change state's money into our money.

281
00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:58.083
We can put it to better use
than those bureaucrats.

282
00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:05.083
That is a wicked idea!

283
00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:11.000
Hit him with a backhand!

284
00:17:15.875 --> 00:17:18.375
We need to flood the country with vodka.

285
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.291
400-600% profit.

286
00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:22.625
800%!

287
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.916
Like Escobar on cocaine!

288
00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.625
He's in the paper!

289
00:17:29.041 --> 00:17:30.291
You'll be just as famous!

290
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.416
I need to pick up some wares.

291
00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:43.375
Remember who pointed you
towards big business.

292
00:17:43.583 --> 00:17:45.041
I'll always help you.

293
00:17:45.125 --> 00:17:47.125
I will never forget this.

294
00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:49.791
The devil is always in the details.

295
00:17:55.583 --> 00:17:59.541
And no more sewing for my playboy husband.

296
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.958
I'm always helping!

297
00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:03.833
Fuck off.

298
00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:06.958
Kazik!

299
00:18:07.833 --> 00:18:11.666
Substitution!
Komar for Lis!

300
00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.666
Heard you're looking for
someone to sell us the booze?

301
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.625
I know just the guy!

302
00:18:18.041 --> 00:18:19.458
In Berlin.

303
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:23.041
I hope he's more real than
our trip to DeNiro's private island…

304
00:18:23.166 --> 00:18:24.833
Don't bullshit a bullshitter!

305
00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:28.166
If at first you don't succeed…

306
00:18:28.458 --> 00:18:29.708
Let the others do the deed!

307
00:18:31.541 --> 00:18:34.375
And here's our friend from the coast!

308
00:18:34.458 --> 00:18:36.208
And no wife!

309
00:18:36.291 --> 00:18:37.291
Gentlemen!

310
00:18:37.458 --> 00:18:40.333
I took care of the fun part of the evening!

311
00:18:42.083 --> 00:18:43.208
Sounds interesting.

312
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:46.125
It's time for some friendly family feud!

313
00:18:57.958 --> 00:18:59.291
Shall we dance. pretty boy?

314
00:19:01.916 --> 00:19:03.500
Maybe later. princess.

315
00:19:08.125 --> 00:19:10.250
There was a slight mix-up.

316
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.791
Is everyone happy?

317
00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.375
Where are you going?

318
00:19:21.125 --> 00:19:24.583
Relax. bro. Family stuff.

319
00:19:25.708 --> 00:19:26.708
I'll be back.

320
00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:28.458
Stick around.

321
00:19:35.666 --> 00:19:37.583
Just look at our life!

322
00:19:53.791 --> 00:19:54.833
Hello. my dear!

323
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.583
I can't. I'm sorry.

324
00:19:57.333 --> 00:20:00.125
I met the Art School dean from Cracow.

325
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.166
The fat one. Have to talk to him.

326
00:20:06.791 --> 00:20:07.791
Krystyna!

327
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.625
How big he is!

328
00:20:12.375 --> 00:20:14.875
I won't go further. I know what's going on.

329
00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:18.458
Can you get me some paintings?

330
00:20:20.625 --> 00:20:22.125
Hold on a second.

331
00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:24.458
- Krystyna…
- Call me Krysia.

332
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:29.166
I know about the women
and your men's business.

333
00:20:29.916 --> 00:20:31.250
I won't agree to a divorce.

334
00:20:31.791 --> 00:20:32.791
"For better or worse."

335
00:20:33.041 --> 00:20:34.291
I swore it in church.

336
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.333
He can't mess with God's will.

337
00:20:37.416 --> 00:20:39.250
Keep it down. please.

338
00:20:39.416 --> 00:20:40.416
I have a kid!

339
00:20:41.125 --> 00:20:42.583
I need security!

340
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:45.833
Get me some paintings.
I know you can.

341
00:20:46.666 --> 00:20:48.958
I'll keep you in mind.

342
00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:51.791
Let me walk you to your cab.

343
00:20:56.458 --> 00:20:59.000
Or maybe your icons?

344
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.000
I heard you talking about value increase!

345
00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:03.833
How it's a good investment.

346
00:21:03.916 --> 00:21:05.791
Those icons…

347
00:21:06.916 --> 00:21:08.041
…are quite rare.

348
00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:09.708
I'll call around.

349
00:21:12.458 --> 00:21:13.458
I'll ask.

350
00:21:28.583 --> 00:21:29.583
Marzena?

351
00:21:29.708 --> 00:21:32.625
See. I got rid of the fat guy.

352
00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.291
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

353
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.125
Maybe we can go to the movies?

354
00:21:38.208 --> 00:21:39.291
Top Gun at 8 pm?

355
00:21:40.041 --> 00:21:41.458
I have to go to Berlin soon.

356
00:21:42.916 --> 00:21:43.916
Bye.

357
00:22:08.416 --> 00:22:09.416
What the hell?

358
00:22:12.625 --> 00:22:14.125
Get behind the wheel.

359
00:23:09.458 --> 00:23:11.416
WEST BERLIN. 1988

360
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Halt!

361
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:17.541
CA.

362
00:23:17.833 --> 00:23:19.500
Store for rich Germans.

363
00:23:19.791 --> 00:23:20.791
Let's go.

364
00:23:20.958 --> 00:23:21.958
You bet!

365
00:23:22.458 --> 00:23:23.791
I'll be right back.

366
00:23:26.166 --> 00:23:27.166
Paradise!

367
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.291
Look! Perfect for you!

368
00:23:59.708 --> 00:24:01.958
Leave the bling.

369
00:24:03.125 --> 00:24:05.958
A Casio is good enough.
And it plays music!

370
00:24:07.291 --> 00:24:08.375
Your suitcases!

371
00:24:08.625 --> 00:24:09.625
Excuse me!

372
00:24:11.333 --> 00:24:12.333
Guys!

373
00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:14.666
Vielen Dank!

374
00:24:15.125 --> 00:24:16.958
I bought western briefcases.

375
00:24:17.375 --> 00:24:18.375
Danke.

376
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:21.083
To Poland? Together?

377
00:24:21.166 --> 00:24:23.083
No. thank you.

378
00:24:24.458 --> 00:24:26.125
I… come back.

379
00:24:26.208 --> 00:24:27.208
Ich warte.

380
00:24:27.375 --> 00:24:30.083
Warte? That's the river in Poznań!

381
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:32.750
Warthe.

382
00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:38.208
She knows our river! In Poznań!

383
00:25:11.958 --> 00:25:13.125
Hello. gentlemen!

384
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:16.916
Let's take care of this vodka business.

385
00:25:17.041 --> 00:25:18.750
It's all a piece of cake.

386
00:25:19.083 --> 00:25:22.666
My lawyers and I are in a hurry.

387
00:25:22.708 --> 00:25:25.500
We're meeting Saudi investors.

388
00:25:25.833 --> 00:25:28.500
Come on in! Don't be shy.

389
00:25:29.333 --> 00:25:30.333
Wait.

390
00:25:31.666 --> 00:25:33.541
Nice to see you. Kazik.

391
00:25:34.208 --> 00:25:35.375
Hallo. Karol!

392
00:25:36.708 --> 00:25:38.375
Wieviel wollen sie kaufen?

393
00:25:39.458 --> 00:25:40.458
Kazik…

394
00:25:41.416 --> 00:25:42.458
Open the vault!

395
00:25:50.666 --> 00:25:51.666
Dough.

396
00:25:52.916 --> 00:25:53.916
Money.

397
00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:02.333
Meine Herren.

398
00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:05.791
We could call this a…

399
00:26:07.208 --> 00:26:09.125
…misunderstanding.

400
00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:12.083
I wish you

401
00:26:13.625 --> 00:26:14.875
a pleasant day.

402
00:26:22.375 --> 00:26:24.000
To Poland? Together?

403
00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:25.458
Where did he go?

404
00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:26.625
To think?

405
00:26:26.666 --> 00:26:30.458
No! He's selling us the vodka
with delayed payment!

406
00:26:30.541 --> 00:26:32.125
Bullshit. He told us to get out.

407
00:26:35.083 --> 00:26:37.625
Our 20.000 German marks are nothing to him.

408
00:26:41.708 --> 00:26:42.708
Pack it up and let's go.

409
00:26:42.791 --> 00:26:43.833
I come back.

410
00:26:54.791 --> 00:26:56.166
I don't believe it!

411
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.000
Parking this junk right here?

412
00:26:59.083 --> 00:27:00.000
Get in.

413
00:27:00.083 --> 00:27:01.416
What are you doing?

414
00:27:01.666 --> 00:27:02.666
Are you crazy?

415
00:27:02.833 --> 00:27:03.833
Bloody SS!

416
00:27:03.958 --> 00:27:05.625
He's a very important man!

417
00:27:05.666 --> 00:27:06.666
Stop him!

418
00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:08.125
He knows Schwarzenegger!

419
00:27:08.166 --> 00:27:09.875
He sails with Navratilova!

420
00:27:11.333 --> 00:27:12.708
What are you doing?

421
00:27:17.208 --> 00:27:18.416
Give me a chance!

422
00:27:18.958 --> 00:27:21.333
I'll get you as much as you want!

423
00:27:22.666 --> 00:27:23.666
Verstanden?

424
00:27:24.666 --> 00:27:25.666
Tell him!

425
00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:40.375
Don't you have distilleries in Poland?

426
00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:44.375
He asks about Polish distilleries.

427
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.791
Why buy here?

428
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.166
Let's make a different deal.

429
00:27:51.208 --> 00:27:53.208
Bring me your spirit.

430
00:27:53.708 --> 00:27:55.041
Spirit? Alcohol?

431
00:27:55.583 --> 00:27:56.791
Poland. Russia...

432
00:27:57.125 --> 00:27:58.125
Tank trucks!

433
00:27:58.708 --> 00:27:59.708
Tank trucks.

434
00:28:01.083 --> 00:28:03.125
I'll fill it in bottles

435
00:28:03.166 --> 00:28:04.833
and sell it back to you.

436
00:28:04.916 --> 00:28:07.083
No questions asked. no customs. no taxes.

437
00:28:07.833 --> 00:28:08.833
Nothing.

438
00:28:08.916 --> 00:28:11.625
Why share profits with the state?

439
00:28:12.458 --> 00:28:14.875
He wants you to bring him pure spirit.

440
00:28:15.291 --> 00:28:16.416
He'll bottle it.

441
00:28:16.541 --> 00:28:18.000
No taxes. no customs.

442
00:28:18.416 --> 00:28:24.000
And you can sell it cheaper than vodka.

443
00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:26.041
Gut?

444
00:28:27.125 --> 00:28:28.291
Is that possible?

445
00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:33.958
New laws will be passed soon.
You have to hurry.

446
00:28:34.833 --> 00:28:36.666
It won't last forever.

447
00:28:37.541 --> 00:28:39.833
Everything is possible.

448
00:28:48.958 --> 00:28:50.416
My friend!

449
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.250
My friends!

450
00:28:55.708 --> 00:28:56.708
I come back!

451
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.500
Thank you!

452
00:29:42.708 --> 00:29:44.291
The army is brilliant.

453
00:29:45.666 --> 00:29:49.000
A base in every town.
Like McDonald's in the West.

454
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.916
Our branches!

455
00:29:53.416 --> 00:29:55.333
This gives us contacts all over the country.

456
00:29:56.416 --> 00:29:59.500
Just need some spirit
to send to Germany.

457
00:29:59.541 --> 00:30:04.083
The army can help us
move the bottled spirit

458
00:30:05.333 --> 00:30:09.000
to wholesalers all over Poland.

459
00:30:11.125 --> 00:30:12.458
That's the deal.

460
00:30:20.791 --> 00:30:22.000
See you tomorrow!

461
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:36.166
I'm Maciejak. with the Polish police.

462
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.416
How's the weather in Berlin?

463
00:30:39.958 --> 00:30:40.958
So that's the deal.

464
00:30:42.416 --> 00:30:44.583
Want us to work on collective farms?

465
00:30:44.916 --> 00:30:47.250
Report each time we take a leak?

466
00:30:49.916 --> 00:30:54.083
Harassing people who want freedom of trade!

467
00:30:54.375 --> 00:30:56.958
Meaningless malcontents!

468
00:30:57.208 --> 00:30:59.750
I'm not here to harass you!

469
00:31:00.833 --> 00:31:01.875
I want to help!

470
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.125
You and Marzena.

471
00:31:04.458 --> 00:31:06.000
How could you help me?

472
00:31:16.791 --> 00:31:20.708
We can talk nicely

473
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
or not.

474
00:31:22.083 --> 00:31:24.625
Someone less nice could beat you up.

475
00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:32.041
What do you want?

476
00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:37.333
Lis.

477
00:31:38.416 --> 00:31:39.416
And Bączek.

478
00:31:41.166 --> 00:31:45.750
It's not you who runs your

479
00:31:45.833 --> 00:31:47.541
small time cartel.

480
00:31:50.666 --> 00:31:51.750
Hello. darling!

481
00:31:52.125 --> 00:31:53.125
Hi!

482
00:31:53.583 --> 00:31:55.041
Everything all right?

483
00:31:55.875 --> 00:31:56.875
Just talking.

484
00:31:57.416 --> 00:32:00.125
I was leaving.

485
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.791
You should also think about it!

486
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.583
Do you want to live like this?

487
00:32:09.791 --> 00:32:13.833
Drive in old Fiats to Berlin
with new Mercs parked here?

488
00:32:14.041 --> 00:32:17.458
Can't we show some patriotic spirit?

489
00:32:17.875 --> 00:32:19.458
We all know it's a lie!

490
00:32:19.791 --> 00:32:21.166
The Merc is stolen!

491
00:32:21.208 --> 00:32:24.416
As soon as it crosses the border
you get in trouble.

492
00:32:24.708 --> 00:32:28.625
We don't cooperate with agencies
in the West. Yet!

493
00:32:30.375 --> 00:32:31.583
This will change.

494
00:32:33.208 --> 00:32:34.875
You still have a chance!

495
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:37.541
Right. Come on!

496
00:32:40.333 --> 00:32:42.333
I'm not naive!

497
00:32:42.416 --> 00:32:45.166
I know it's not easy doing business here.

498
00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.583
It's getting to dangerous.

499
00:32:47.125 --> 00:32:48.833
It's time to step away.

500
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.916
If this deal works out.
we'll talk about this.

501
00:32:52.958 --> 00:32:54.125
Okay?
Come on.

502
00:32:58.041 --> 00:32:59.041
Don't be mad.

503
00:33:05.791 --> 00:33:07.250
You said you had a present?

504
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.375
Right. where is my mind.

505
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Ready?

506
00:33:20.208 --> 00:33:21.208
Jesus!

507
00:33:22.416 --> 00:33:23.416
Is it real?

508
00:33:23.458 --> 00:33:25.291
Straight from Berlin!
A Big Mac!

509
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.416
I'm sorry it's cold.

510
00:33:33.208 --> 00:33:34.208
Jesus!

511
00:33:35.916 --> 00:33:37.166
It smells so good!

512
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:38.250
Told you!

513
00:33:40.083 --> 00:33:41.083
Thank you!

514
00:33:44.583 --> 00:33:45.750
Want to split it?

515
00:33:45.791 --> 00:33:47.000
No. I've had one.

516
00:33:49.125 --> 00:33:50.125
I have more!

517
00:33:50.375 --> 00:33:52.250
- It's so good!
- You like it?

518
00:34:14.958 --> 00:34:15.958
Hey! Romeo!

519
00:34:17.541 --> 00:34:20.000
Where's this Army-McDonald's?

520
00:34:22.875 --> 00:34:25.375
- Anybody coming?
- Coming.

521
00:34:33.166 --> 00:34:34.208
That's alcohol!

522
00:34:35.416 --> 00:34:36.791
Vodka down the drain!

523
00:34:38.791 --> 00:34:40.958
That's communist negligence.

524
00:34:41.291 --> 00:34:46.000
In the US you'd get fired for this.

525
00:35:02.083 --> 00:35:05.083
Guys. this is colonel Zabieło.

526
00:35:05.458 --> 00:35:08.000
The commander of the local army base.

527
00:35:08.958 --> 00:35:10.333
You have to be the husband.

528
00:35:10.625 --> 00:35:11.666
The lieutenant.

529
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:15.125
I am lieutenant Lis. Cunning as a fox.

530
00:35:15.416 --> 00:35:16.791
We'll see about that.

531
00:35:20.375 --> 00:35:22.083
And here's the plant manager.

532
00:35:22.458 --> 00:35:23.750
No deal!

533
00:35:24.416 --> 00:35:26.458
You can send them home.

534
00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:27.833
What's wrong?

535
00:35:27.875 --> 00:35:29.166
They have a buyer!

536
00:35:29.791 --> 00:35:32.208
- I won't sell.
- Why not?

537
00:35:33.083 --> 00:35:34.083
Do something!

538
00:35:34.791 --> 00:35:37.166
Unless you have… dollars.

539
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.250
I will take dollars.

540
00:35:39.416 --> 00:35:41.541
Why only dollars?

541
00:35:42.791 --> 00:35:45.041
Because I need a new line!

542
00:35:45.375 --> 00:35:46.375
And gaskets!

543
00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:48.250
The old line is falling apart.

544
00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:52.625
And since the army is in charge
I can't get any gaskets!

545
00:35:52.666 --> 00:35:53.833
You are forgetting yourself!

546
00:35:53.916 --> 00:35:55.750
Stop talking!

547
00:35:55.833 --> 00:35:57.473
With the old government
we had everything!

548
00:35:57.541 --> 00:35:59.791
Now with the army in charge?

549
00:35:59.875 --> 00:36:01.000
There's nothing!

550
00:36:02.125 --> 00:36:03.375
Without the gaskets

551
00:36:03.666 --> 00:36:05.250
I'll have to listen

552
00:36:05.708 --> 00:36:08.291
about communist negligence!

553
00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:10.083
I am a good manager!

554
00:36:11.458 --> 00:36:12.458
Listen.

555
00:36:15.875 --> 00:36:16.875
I like you.

556
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.666
I can do business with you.

557
00:36:20.083 --> 00:36:21.083
We'll get you dollars.

558
00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.500
Everything.

559
00:36:23.916 --> 00:36:26.666
Our customer provided 2 million dollars.

560
00:36:27.291 --> 00:36:29.166
He's a big player.

561
00:36:31.791 --> 00:36:34.000
Excuse us for a second!

562
00:36:36.166 --> 00:36:37.625
We don't have that kind of money!

563
00:36:38.458 --> 00:36:39.458
The dollars?

564
00:36:40.625 --> 00:36:42.208
How can you get it?

565
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.041
One has to steal the first million!

566
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:50.750
Gentlemen.

567
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.708
is there a phone I could use?

568
00:36:54.291 --> 00:36:56.375
Certainly. This way.

569
00:37:08.958 --> 00:37:10.250
Hello. Mr. Bączek!

570
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:14.583
70:30 for you.

571
00:37:15.166 --> 00:37:16.208
It's all there.

572
00:37:40.208 --> 00:37:41.208
Are we good?

573
00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:44.958
I'd like my briefcase back.

574
00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.375
From last month.

575
00:37:46.833 --> 00:37:48.250
They're not cheap.

576
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.791
More people are coming?

577
00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:02.166
Indeed.

578
00:38:02.333 --> 00:38:03.541
But individually.

579
00:38:03.916 --> 00:38:04.916
Beef tartare?

580
00:38:05.083 --> 00:38:06.875
Two eggs. the way you like it.

581
00:38:08.708 --> 00:38:09.708
Some bread.

582
00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:11.041
Mr. Bączek?

583
00:38:16.333 --> 00:38:18.375
I need dollars.

584
00:38:19.666 --> 00:38:21.416
For the spirit for the German.

585
00:38:22.375 --> 00:38:23.708
Business of a lifetime.

586
00:38:24.333 --> 00:38:25.833
You deal in currency.

587
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:27.833
So you're not going to help?

588
00:38:29.875 --> 00:38:31.000
Piece of advice.

589
00:38:32.208 --> 00:38:33.916
Big money stinks.

590
00:38:34.083 --> 00:38:37.041
That's why we'll after it
like flies after shit.

591
00:38:37.958 --> 00:38:41.166
But wise men know
that shit needs some perfume.

592
00:38:44.208 --> 00:38:45.208
Some dessert?

593
00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:48.458
Apple pie.

594
00:38:48.583 --> 00:38:49.583
Or no…

595
00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:51.916
I want a whole cake!

596
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Chocolate?

597
00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:57.375
It's good. Swiss.

598
00:38:58.500 --> 00:38:59.875
Shokotella.

599
00:39:00.291 --> 00:39:01.958
All children like chocolate.

600
00:39:02.833 --> 00:39:04.083
And everyone likes

601
00:39:04.333 --> 00:39:05.333
children.

602
00:39:05.375 --> 00:39:06.375
So…

603
00:39:06.708 --> 00:39:07.708
So what?

604
00:39:09.291 --> 00:39:13.375
So we'll contact you with
the Shokotella guy.

605
00:39:13.875 --> 00:39:16.208
You'll be the representative for Poland.

606
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.958
You won't make money.

607
00:39:18.333 --> 00:39:21.333
but it'll turn you into
legitimate businesspeople.

608
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.375
putting a smile on kids' faces.

609
00:39:25.458 --> 00:39:28.125
But how will I pay for the spirit?

610
00:39:32.166 --> 00:39:34.000
See Wacław Trojan.

611
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.916
- Banker.
- And diplomat.

612
00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:38.000
Just came back from Luxembourg.

613
00:39:38.916 --> 00:39:41.166
Wants to get our financial market going.

614
00:39:42.833 --> 00:39:46.291
So he'll buy the chocolate
and get us the currency?

615
00:39:46.375 --> 00:39:47.375
No.

616
00:39:49.041 --> 00:39:50.916
You eat the chocolate.

617
00:39:53.666 --> 00:39:55.333
Tell Trojan everything.

618
00:39:56.708 --> 00:39:58.291
Mr. Bączek is leaving.

619
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:06.250
Grab a business-card.

620
00:40:06.666 --> 00:40:08.791
BANKER
Wacław Trojan

621
00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:30.666
Honorary Consulate
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg

622
00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:00.208
Nobody noticed that the diplomat
was military intelligence.

623
00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:02.500
Everything was set up.

624
00:41:02.583 --> 00:41:06.416
He was the same guy
they spoke to in Berlin.

625
00:41:09.416 --> 00:41:10.875
And ready.

626
00:41:11.333 --> 00:41:13.833
Tea in seconds.

627
00:41:15.625 --> 00:41:16.625
That's magic.

628
00:41:18.166 --> 00:41:19.541
I need to touch it.

629
00:41:24.458 --> 00:41:26.375
What's it called again? Micro…

630
00:41:27.125 --> 00:41:28.125
Micro-well?

631
00:41:29.416 --> 00:41:30.416
Micro-WAVE.

632
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:34.833
Wait until you see
the trick with a credit card.

633
00:41:35.708 --> 00:41:38.750
You put it in a microwave and boom!

634
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:41.666
What's in this card?

635
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.375
Piece of plastic.

636
00:41:46.541 --> 00:41:48.875
You put it in a wall
and money comes out.

637
00:41:49.625 --> 00:41:51.791
Where can I get this plastic?

638
00:41:52.083 --> 00:41:53.291
Only in the West.

639
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:56.583
The West has to be…

640
00:41:56.875 --> 00:41:57.916
paradise.

641
00:41:58.958 --> 00:42:00.500
I want to go to the West!

642
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:02.250
Ladies.

643
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.625
how about you go for a smoke?

644
00:42:06.041 --> 00:42:09.791
We'll discuss our visit
with the Sultan of Brunei.

645
00:42:10.166 --> 00:42:12.791
the wealthiest man alive.

646
00:42:27.166 --> 00:42:28.708
So how much do you need?

647
00:42:31.416 --> 00:42:32.416
Two…

648
00:42:32.708 --> 00:42:34.916
Don't inhale.

649
00:42:36.166 --> 00:42:37.875
Two? Did I hear right?

650
00:42:40.458 --> 00:42:41.958
- Two.
- Two what?

651
00:42:43.875 --> 00:42:44.875
Two million.

652
00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:16.250
They say one has to steal the first million.

653
00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:19.041
Told you!

654
00:43:20.083 --> 00:43:21.083
Given…

655
00:43:21.583 --> 00:43:24.333
…we steal the first million.

656
00:43:24.666 --> 00:43:26.541
we'd still be one million short.

657
00:43:27.166 --> 00:43:28.750
Doesn't solve anything.

658
00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:30.291
And that is why

659
00:43:31.416 --> 00:43:33.416
you won't steal anything.

660
00:43:34.416 --> 00:43:36.083
Just cut it out. From newspapers.

661
00:43:36.125 --> 00:43:37.125
Cut it out?

662
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.500
What newspapers?

663
00:43:38.583 --> 00:43:39.833
Any paper will do.

664
00:43:39.916 --> 00:43:40.916
Got a light?

665
00:43:43.208 --> 00:43:46.000
- Are you crazy? So much money?
- Easy!

666
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:48.541
It's not your two dollars.

667
00:43:57.041 --> 00:44:00.375
Once you have more money.
you'll see it's just paper.

668
00:44:00.875 --> 00:44:02.083
Just paper.

669
00:44:11.208 --> 00:44:12.375
Grab some newspapers.

670
00:44:13.583 --> 00:44:14.875
And start cutting.

671
00:44:15.458 --> 00:44:16.958
I'll handle the rest.

672
00:44:17.333 --> 00:44:19.000
And the tennis pro will come in handy.

673
00:44:20.666 --> 00:44:22.208
Always glad to help.

674
00:44:22.375 --> 00:44:23.958
To keep up appearances.

675
00:44:24.041 --> 00:44:26.583
I'll contact you with a cooperative bank.

676
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:28.583
You need to own

677
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.875
a state company.

678
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Be quiet.

679
00:44:46.333 --> 00:44:47.291
Is something wrong?

680
00:44:47.333 --> 00:44:49.833
Just looking for a place to smoke.

681
00:44:50.041 --> 00:44:51.458
Do you have a light?

682
00:44:57.375 --> 00:44:58.375
Thank you.

683
00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:07.250
Thanks.

684
00:45:07.375 --> 00:45:08.666
Are you a snitch?

685
00:45:09.125 --> 00:45:11.083
- What?
- Who do you work for?

686
00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:13.458
- It's not like that.
- You have a minute to explain.

687
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:17.708
I worry about Antoni.

688
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:20.708
That he ends up shit creek.

689
00:45:21.416 --> 00:45:24.208
Who the hell is this consul?
Damn porno fan.

690
00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:27.625
Thinks we're stupid
and he can keep us in the kitchen.

691
00:45:28.541 --> 00:45:29.958
Give me that lighter.

692
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.708
You might be right.

693
00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:35.875
But what can we do?

694
00:45:42.958 --> 00:45:44.666
Maybe we should join forces?

695
00:46:13.041 --> 00:46:16.500
Polish Socialist Youth Union

696
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:23.500
That is great!

697
00:46:23.833 --> 00:46:24.958
Got something else?

698
00:46:25.083 --> 00:46:26.083
Sure!

699
00:46:26.166 --> 00:46:29.625
There's a flight simulator.
Brilliant.

700
00:46:29.708 --> 00:46:31.250
And strategy games.

701
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:34.166
My… Our boy plays them for hours!

702
00:46:36.375 --> 00:46:37.375
And I'm dead.

703
00:46:39.541 --> 00:46:40.541
Wanna try?

704
00:46:42.041 --> 00:46:44.958
If only you were so brilliant in other areas…

705
00:46:46.958 --> 00:46:48.458
Chanel No.5

706
00:46:49.125 --> 00:46:50.291
Only available for dollars.

707
00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:53.666
Interesting thing that Commodore.

708
00:46:53.833 --> 00:46:54.833
Commodore

709
00:46:55.208 --> 00:46:56.416
with a K.

710
00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.833
Can we talk about that chocolate?

711
00:47:01.541 --> 00:47:02.541
Short story.

712
00:47:06.833 --> 00:47:10.000
You become chairman of the board.
nominated by the Youth Union.

713
00:47:10.375 --> 00:47:13.458
The Union becomes majority shareholder.

714
00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:16.958
While in reality the company is yours.

715
00:47:17.083 --> 00:47:18.083
Ours.

716
00:47:18.291 --> 00:47:19.750
Ours and the Union's.

717
00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:21.791
He's the

718
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:26.500
CEO and shareholder.

719
00:47:26.833 --> 00:47:28.333
Soldier. Servant of the state.

720
00:47:28.625 --> 00:47:31.083
Son of a general from
the Military Council!

721
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:32.916
Of National Salvation!

722
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
And you!

723
00:47:34.583 --> 00:47:37.500
On paper.
For the optics.

724
00:47:38.416 --> 00:47:40.041
People trust the army.

725
00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:45.000
What would I have to do?

726
00:47:45.333 --> 00:47:47.500
On the supervisory board?

727
00:47:47.916 --> 00:47:49.166
Just be present.

728
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:51.333
As a young politician

729
00:47:51.708 --> 00:47:53.416
you should not ask "what".

730
00:47:53.666 --> 00:47:54.708
Ask "how much".

731
00:47:58.583 --> 00:47:59.583
Right.

732
00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:01.708
How much?

733
00:48:01.958 --> 00:48:02.958
100.

734
00:48:03.125 --> 00:48:04.125
100?

735
00:48:07.083 --> 00:48:10.250
I like a good negotiator.

736
00:48:11.708 --> 00:48:13.500
150$ a month.

737
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.666
Shall we start printing and visit the notary?

738
00:48:29.375 --> 00:48:32.375
What's the name of the company?

739
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:37.500
Maybe something patriotic?

740
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Posnania?

741
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.625
What about that?

742
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.083
Posnania Import Export.

743
00:48:44.458 --> 00:48:46.208
Short
PIE!

744
00:48:47.166 --> 00:48:48.166
Pie!

745
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.208
Goes well with chocolate.

746
00:48:54.708 --> 00:48:56.791
You forgot the Commandore.

747
00:48:57.625 --> 00:49:00.333
It's a present.
Play with your kids.

748
00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:04.416
With the TV-set it goes for 500$.

749
00:49:04.958 --> 00:49:06.625
Welcome to hard currency paradise.

750
00:49:11.375 --> 00:49:12.375
Think fast!

751
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.250
Good enough for Stockholm.

752
00:50:01.708 --> 00:50:03.375
Mr. Komar! It's an honor!

753
00:50:04.041 --> 00:50:05.333
Welcome to our humble abode.

754
00:50:05.375 --> 00:50:06.708
Hallo!

755
00:50:06.791 --> 00:50:11.208
I didn't know the consul
knew such famous people!

756
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.500
Thank you.

757
00:50:12.625 --> 00:50:15.291
I can't remember where I met him.

758
00:50:15.791 --> 00:50:17.625
Must've been at Roman Polanski's.

759
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:19.208
In his Alpine hut.

760
00:50:19.791 --> 00:50:21.791
Wouldn't mind owning one myself.

761
00:50:22.875 --> 00:50:25.291
Beautiful banks you have in Poland.

762
00:50:26.291 --> 00:50:27.500
Call me Filip.

763
00:50:28.541 --> 00:50:30.291
I have a present for you.

764
00:50:31.291 --> 00:50:33.541
I hear your son is interested in sports?

765
00:50:34.541 --> 00:50:36.541
I have a daughter.

766
00:50:36.875 --> 00:50:37.958
Two. actually.

767
00:50:38.041 --> 00:50:41.750
Great! Maybe one of them
will be a new Navratilova!

768
00:50:41.958 --> 00:50:43.833
Just better looking.

769
00:50:44.333 --> 00:50:48.416
I used this in the semi-final
in Stockholm.

770
00:50:48.916 --> 00:50:50.541
Must've been a tough match.

771
00:50:50.625 --> 00:50:53.958
Looks as if someone hit it on the pavement.

772
00:50:55.208 --> 00:50:57.416
You know how it is.
It's not easy.

773
00:50:58.625 --> 00:50:59.750
Before I forget.

774
00:51:00.208 --> 00:51:01.708
One small matter.

775
00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:04.750
- I have friends who sell chocolate.
- Sweet.

776
00:51:04.833 --> 00:51:07.750
It's a Socialist Youth company.
so it's political.

777
00:51:07.958 --> 00:51:08.958
Posnania.

778
00:51:09.333 --> 00:51:12.791
They put a smile on kids' faces.

779
00:51:13.875 --> 00:51:17.208
If you could help them out…

780
00:51:17.583 --> 00:51:19.625
You're not trying to bribe me?

781
00:51:21.166 --> 00:51:23.041
I would never…

782
00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:28.375
Kidding!

783
00:51:29.083 --> 00:51:31.708
For you? Anything!

784
00:51:31.875 --> 00:51:32.875
Great!

785
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:37.000
There will be some gentlemen here tomorrow.

786
00:51:37.166 --> 00:51:39.416
- What was the name?
- Posnania.

787
00:51:40.208 --> 00:51:42.416
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

788
00:51:44.333 --> 00:51:45.416
Funny guy.

789
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Here you go.

790
00:51:52.625 --> 00:51:54.500
Stop slacking off!
Start cutting!

791
00:51:56.125 --> 00:51:57.125
It stands here…

792
00:51:57.625 --> 00:51:59.416
It says.

793
00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:02.291
About our Polish river.

794
00:52:04.083 --> 00:52:07.708
It stands here that Warta is overflowing.

795
00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:09.208
It says!

796
00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.500
All right. gentlemen.

797
00:52:18.916 --> 00:52:21.625
Let's open the bags and start counting.

798
00:52:22.583 --> 00:52:26.208
There are Mr. Komar's friends.
The tennis pro's!

799
00:52:26.708 --> 00:52:28.375
Rules are rules.

800
00:52:29.875 --> 00:52:32.791
For all I know it could be
cut up papers.

801
00:52:32.875 --> 00:52:34.208
You must be joking!

802
00:52:34.458 --> 00:52:35.458
Some trust. maybe?

803
00:52:35.625 --> 00:52:38.375
Trust. but verify!

804
00:52:39.125 --> 00:52:40.833
Do you know who said that?

805
00:52:40.916 --> 00:52:41.916
I do.

806
00:52:42.083 --> 00:52:43.083
Lenin.

807
00:52:44.416 --> 00:52:47.500
Just leave it.
You don't want our money?

808
00:52:47.583 --> 00:52:49.250
Let's go somewhere else.

809
00:52:49.916 --> 00:52:52.958
That won't be necessary.

810
00:52:53.166 --> 00:52:54.833
Thank you for your vigilance.

811
00:52:55.083 --> 00:52:57.708
Let me handle this personally.

812
00:52:57.875 --> 00:53:00.208
A famous client. a respected company.

813
00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:01.625
entrepreneurship spirit

814
00:53:02.291 --> 00:53:04.541
of the Polish Socialist Youth Union!

815
00:53:04.583 --> 00:53:07.000
Gentlemen! To the right. please.

816
00:53:07.583 --> 00:53:09.000
Don't be shy.

817
00:53:09.625 --> 00:53:12.666
It's a political matter
of international reach.

818
00:53:14.916 --> 00:53:18.000
If you vouch for them.

819
00:53:18.708 --> 00:53:20.750
then so be it.

820
00:53:21.958 --> 00:53:24.916
Let's assume it's twenty billion złoty.

821
00:53:25.125 --> 00:53:29.333
Here's a deposit confirmation.

822
00:53:29.416 --> 00:53:34.750
This will allow you to buy 2 million dollars.

823
00:53:34.791 --> 00:53:40.000
You have a month to turn your chocolate over.

824
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.041
If I don't have the money back by then.
I will have to look into those bags.

825
00:53:46.125 --> 00:53:48.708
I hope all is clear.

826
00:53:49.708 --> 00:53:51.291
Yes. sir.

827
00:53:51.375 --> 00:53:53.625
We will switch the bags before then.

828
00:53:53.708 --> 00:53:54.958
Great!

829
00:53:57.291 --> 00:53:58.291
Very well.

830
00:54:19.541 --> 00:54:20.666
Can you tell me.

831
00:54:21.083 --> 00:54:23.041
why the Germans need so much spirit?

832
00:54:23.125 --> 00:54:24.250
The hell I know!

833
00:54:26.166 --> 00:54:27.458
Disinfecting hospitals?

834
00:54:28.708 --> 00:54:29.708
But this much?

835
00:54:30.041 --> 00:54:31.708
Germans like it clean.

836
00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:09.291
OUTSKIRTS OF WEST BERLIN

837
00:55:09.375 --> 00:55:13.000
Time for the baptism of fire.

838
00:55:13.458 --> 00:55:16.083
That is new in the People's Republic!

839
00:55:16.166 --> 00:55:17.708
I hope they let us in.

840
00:55:18.291 --> 00:55:19.666
Remember what to say?

841
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:24.750
According to the Ministry

842
00:55:24.958 --> 00:55:26.750
of Foreign Trade.

843
00:55:26.875 --> 00:55:29.250
I can't remember.
Do I have to say it?

844
00:55:30.083 --> 00:55:33.166
Remember! Business is a show!

845
00:55:34.125 --> 00:55:37.791
You can't stand the pressure?
You're out!

846
00:55:38.916 --> 00:55:40.291
Keep calm.

847
00:55:42.458 --> 00:55:44.916
What if they ask me what the vodka is for?

848
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.583
Say we're selling it through Posnania.

849
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:50.500
Just don't mention my husband. the chairman.

850
00:55:50.583 --> 00:55:52.875
and your husband. the vice-chairman.

851
00:55:53.666 --> 00:55:54.666
Guys!

852
00:55:55.333 --> 00:55:56.333
It's finished?

853
00:55:56.458 --> 00:55:57.458
That's all?

854
00:55:57.625 --> 00:55:58.625
Let's go!

855
00:55:59.041 --> 00:56:00.416
Close the door please.

856
00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.500
Faster!

857
00:56:06.583 --> 00:56:07.583
And go!

858
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:18.791
Oh my gosh.

859
00:56:20.166 --> 00:56:22.208
Fingers crossed!

860
00:56:25.875 --> 00:56:28.833
Do I have to explain this racket
to the customs guys?

861
00:56:30.083 --> 00:56:31.875
It's not a racket!

862
00:56:32.416 --> 00:56:36.333
And the whole transport is in your name.

863
00:56:36.541 --> 00:56:40.375
So you have to put it through customs.

864
00:56:44.125 --> 00:56:45.125
Go!

865
00:56:52.958 --> 00:56:53.958
Good evening.

866
00:56:55.875 --> 00:56:56.875
Trunk please.

867
00:56:59.708 --> 00:57:01.791
Look. I have

868
00:57:02.125 --> 00:57:04.375
trousers for my husband.

869
00:57:04.875 --> 00:57:06.583
an electric piano for my son

870
00:57:07.208 --> 00:57:10.375
and three trucks.

871
00:57:12.541 --> 00:57:15.250
And what is inside said trucks?

872
00:57:16.583 --> 00:57:17.583
Vodka.

873
00:57:18.208 --> 00:57:19.875
Spirit.
Very good.

874
00:57:20.083 --> 00:57:21.458
Even Reagan likes it!

875
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.166
Do you have a concession?

876
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:24.250
Concession?

877
00:57:25.458 --> 00:57:27.125
The trade foreign minister

878
00:57:27.625 --> 00:57:31.125
will bring the alcohol in December.

879
00:57:31.291 --> 00:57:33.791
Do you understand any of this?
Crazy woman.

880
00:57:34.708 --> 00:57:37.583
What am I supposed to do
with all the vodka?

881
00:57:37.875 --> 00:57:38.875
Dear madam.

882
00:57:39.375 --> 00:57:42.625
this vodka will not enter the
People's Republic of Poland.

883
00:57:43.458 --> 00:57:44.916
It's not a booze den!

884
00:57:45.375 --> 00:57:46.666
You're in trouble.

885
00:57:48.416 --> 00:57:54.166
According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade.

886
00:57:54.708 --> 00:57:58.250
the import of alcohol not for sale

887
00:57:58.333 --> 00:58:01.750
is as of today excluded from concessioning.

888
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.791
Entering Poland with alcohol
for private use

889
00:58:07.208 --> 00:58:10.958
requires merely a bill of sale.
which I have here.

890
00:58:16.916 --> 00:58:18.541
Do you know about this?

891
00:58:21.375 --> 00:58:22.916
I need to call Warsaw.

892
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.708
Everything seems in order.

893
00:58:52.708 --> 00:58:53.708
You can go.

894
00:58:54.791 --> 00:58:56.250
Good-bye!

895
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.000
Now that was something!

896
00:59:15.875 --> 00:59:17.916
The devil himself
couldn't have pulled it off.

897
00:59:17.958 --> 00:59:19.375
But two women could!

898
00:59:20.541 --> 00:59:22.083
They will make movies about us!

899
00:59:22.291 --> 00:59:23.291
You'll see.

900
01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:04.166
Hello again!

901
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:05.291
Hello!

902
01:00:05.375 --> 01:00:07.833
Personal use. is it?
How much do you have?

903
01:00:07.958 --> 01:00:08.958
This time it's

904
01:00:09.625 --> 01:00:11.458
154.

905
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.375
Almost had me fooled.

906
01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:17.708
You're something!

907
01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:25.208
I thought she was crazy.

908
01:00:25.291 --> 01:00:28.416
but she really had 154 trucks
filled with booze.

909
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:31.208
For personal use.

910
01:00:31.791 --> 01:00:33.458
I'd like to see her liver.

911
01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:50.333
Guten Tag!

912
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:51.875
How can we help?

913
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:53.375
Rolex watches.

914
01:00:53.833 --> 01:00:54.833
Daytona.

915
01:00:59.041 --> 01:01:00.041
Rolex.

916
01:01:01.583 --> 01:01:02.583
I'm Kazik.

917
01:01:03.125 --> 01:01:04.458
The watch is Rolex.

918
01:01:18.625 --> 01:01:20.000
35.000 German marks.

919
01:01:22.291 --> 01:01:23.500
How much is that?

920
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.083
20.000.

921
01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:28.333
That's dollars.
How much in złoty?

922
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
200 million.

923
01:01:36.166 --> 01:01:37.375
We'll take three.

924
01:01:38.875 --> 01:01:41.166
Ask whether we get a discount.

925
01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:50.041
Do we get a discount if we buy three?

926
01:01:50.833 --> 01:01:52.625
Certainly.

927
01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:24.500
Ask for something for a daughter.

928
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.666
You don't have a daughter!

929
01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:34.208
Nothing for the wife?

930
01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:37.791
Remember this.

931
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.291
A wife gets her kids in the summer

932
01:02:40.541 --> 01:02:42.041
and slip-ons in winter.

933
01:02:42.083 --> 01:02:43.416
Not golden watches.

934
01:02:46.166 --> 01:02:47.208
I'll take that.

935
01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.500
This one. please.

936
01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:51.208
Und!

937
01:02:53.541 --> 01:02:56.791
I rented those safe deposit boxes.

938
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.375
How much do we have?

939
01:03:01.458 --> 01:03:02.458
Millions!

940
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.791
But you were wrong with your 400% margin.

941
01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:08.875
But we're doing good?

942
01:03:10.166 --> 01:03:11.625
It's 800%!

943
01:03:13.083 --> 01:03:14.791
We're making more than Escobar!

944
01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.666
While he is being chased
by all the police in the world.

945
01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:19.583
we have just one stubborn cop.

946
01:03:20.708 --> 01:03:22.083
And round it goes!

947
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.166
They told me I could get trousers here?

948
01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:20.416
Used to. We are changing businesses.

949
01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:22.791
To what?

950
01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:26.041
Best spirit… I mean chocolate!

951
01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:28.666
Chocolate. you say?

952
01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:30.291
Here.

953
01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:34.958
What is going on here?

954
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.041
The man wanted to buy trousers
and I explained the situation.

955
01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:40.166
I was just leaving.

956
01:04:41.708 --> 01:04:42.708
Good-bye.

957
01:04:49.916 --> 01:04:51.875
Police training sucks these days.

958
01:04:53.041 --> 01:04:54.083
Was that a cop?

959
01:04:55.541 --> 01:04:56.666
Surplus jacket?

960
01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:59.166
Pretends to be cool.
spiteful eyes?

961
01:04:59.208 --> 01:05:00.625
Everybody would notice!

962
01:05:00.666 --> 01:05:02.333
And we never had walk-ins!

963
01:05:02.375 --> 01:05:03.833
Plainclothes cop.

964
01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.500
Damn.

965
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.958
Five more minutes?

966
01:05:26.666 --> 01:05:28.208
Sabina…

967
01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:35.208
Feels like old times.

968
01:05:37.125 --> 01:05:38.833
I'd like to go back in time.

969
01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:44.875
Our child – would it be a girl or a son?

970
01:05:46.166 --> 01:05:47.166
Don't know.

971
01:05:47.625 --> 01:05:49.083
I was in shock. Didn't ask.

972
01:05:52.208 --> 01:05:54.333
It was nice. but your Kaz has to

973
01:05:55.041 --> 01:05:57.125
go back to big business.

974
01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:00.250
Time to swallow some tiny fish.

975
01:06:03.666 --> 01:06:04.916
Go get them. shark!

976
01:06:04.958 --> 01:06:06.500
Or they will swallow you!

977
01:06:22.791 --> 01:06:24.208
For some shopping.

978
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Do you have some left?

979
01:06:29.166 --> 01:06:30.166
Stupid!

980
01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:34.041
Bye!

981
01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:14.583
Kaz? Did you forget something?

982
01:07:22.458 --> 01:07:23.458
It's you.

983
01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.333
Brought you some presents.

984
01:07:35.541 --> 01:07:37.000
You really are stupid.

985
01:07:37.041 --> 01:07:38.750
Think I can't afford coffee?

986
01:07:39.833 --> 01:07:41.041
Never refuse presents.

987
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:43.250
Never.

988
01:07:47.458 --> 01:07:48.958
You know what I want.

989
01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:51.041
And you know what I want.

990
01:07:51.625 --> 01:07:54.000
Where is she?
Where is my daughter?

991
01:07:57.208 --> 01:07:58.208
Address!

992
01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:07.041
Your report.

993
01:08:22.875 --> 01:08:24.083
What a naughty boy!

994
01:08:25.666 --> 01:08:27.500
Hiding his income.

995
01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:32.000
Did you find out anything about Marzena?

996
01:08:33.458 --> 01:08:34.666
I'm working on it.

997
01:08:34.708 --> 01:08:36.208
She's starting to trust me.

998
01:08:36.291 --> 01:08:40.125
Keep working.
You might even get a medal.

999
01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:46.750
Her address.

1000
01:08:52.291 --> 01:08:53.666
You have to make do with pictures.

1001
01:09:05.291 --> 01:09:07.208
You should not have given her up.

1002
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.250
I just want to see her.

1003
01:09:11.125 --> 01:09:12.750
Yours and Bączek's.

1004
01:09:15.791 --> 01:09:17.458
I hope he doesn't know about her.

1005
01:09:17.541 --> 01:09:19.166
I told him I had a miscarriage.

1006
01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:20.875
Let's keep it that way.

1007
01:09:27.416 --> 01:09:32.333
Soon we'll allow private currency exchange.

1008
01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:36.791
Kazik. that's something up our alley?

1009
01:09:37.666 --> 01:09:39.291
I'm done with currency.

1010
01:09:40.208 --> 01:09:43.000
Olek might be interested.

1011
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.291
For the country. Prime minister!

1012
01:09:47.083 --> 01:09:48.666
Keep the vodka flowing.

1013
01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:51.041
Are you doing so well?
With the chocolate?

1014
01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:52.750
It's good money.

1015
01:09:53.416 --> 01:09:54.416
Chocolate?

1016
01:09:59.166 --> 01:10:00.416
To go with the chocolate.

1017
01:10:01.208 --> 01:10:02.208
No hangover!

1018
01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:05.833
This needs to be diluted.

1019
01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:07.666
It's all on the label.

1020
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.875
And here's the sports version.

1021
01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:14.791
Limited edition.

1022
01:10:16.166 --> 01:10:17.416
That's good.

1023
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:20.333
People are bored.
Let them play with spirits.

1024
01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:24.708
There's this company in Sweden.

1025
01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:27.458
They sell you furniture

1026
01:10:27.541 --> 01:10:29.333
which you have to assemble yourself.

1027
01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.750
And people buy it!

1028
01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:32.625
They line up for it!

1029
01:10:32.708 --> 01:10:34.375
Just like here. but they didn't have war.

1030
01:10:34.458 --> 01:10:37.083
Like on this TV show!

1031
01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:38.875
„Do it yourself” with Adam Słodowy.

1032
01:10:40.166 --> 01:10:43.166
Maybe it's his family's business!

1033
01:10:44.333 --> 01:10:46.625
How much do you make on that chocolate?

1034
01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:48.666
4-5 million dollars.

1035
01:10:49.666 --> 01:10:50.666
Per week.

1036
01:10:51.958 --> 01:10:54.541
Once I wanted to be like Al Capone.

1037
01:10:55.208 --> 01:10:57.291
Now we're bigger.

1038
01:10:59.083 --> 01:11:01.416
Prime minister. the press is waiting.

1039
01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:02.875
Let them in.

1040
01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:05.416
Hide the booze!

1041
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:08.166
Don't hide anything!

1042
01:11:09.375 --> 01:11:12.125
Let them see how good we're doing.

1043
01:11:12.541 --> 01:11:15.458
They'll show some respect.

1044
01:11:17.416 --> 01:11:22.000
How are the relations between the government
and private sector?

1045
01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:23.125
Excellent.

1046
01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:27.416
I've just had a great meeting
with top entrepreneurs.

1047
01:11:28.166 --> 01:11:31.583
Supported by a world-famous tennis pro.

1048
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.541
Can there be a better answer?

1049
01:11:33.708 --> 01:11:38.541
Few people know that Poznań is
the business capital of Poland.

1050
01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:41.000
Thank you very much.

1051
01:11:42.041 --> 01:11:43.041
Thank you.

1052
01:11:44.583 --> 01:11:45.583
Ladies and gentlemen.

1053
01:11:46.708 --> 01:11:47.708
please enjoy!

1054
01:11:48.375 --> 01:11:50.083
Compliments of the house!

1055
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.708
This guy's suit?

1056
01:11:55.833 --> 01:11:57.250
Must be worth 200$.

1057
01:11:57.416 --> 01:11:59.416
A year's wages.

1058
01:12:01.625 --> 01:12:05.958
How did they turn this town into
Poland's booze El Dorado

1059
01:12:06.041 --> 01:12:07.958
even though there are no distilleries here?

1060
01:12:08.166 --> 01:12:10.375
Holier than thou?

1061
01:12:10.541 --> 01:12:12.291
Leave the private business be!

1062
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.791
Go pray to Lenin!

1063
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.125
Hello. neigbor!

1064
01:13:10.083 --> 01:13:12.916
You're good for nothing!

1065
01:13:13.541 --> 01:13:15.583
Didn't make it again?

1066
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:17.250
Leave me be.

1067
01:13:17.916 --> 01:13:19.708
Should've left it to me.

1068
01:13:19.916 --> 01:13:23.458
We would have swapped the bags with ease.

1069
01:13:27.791 --> 01:13:29.791
Leave me alone!

1070
01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.416
You gave me a bloody nose!

1071
01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.333
Maciejak. state police.

1072
01:13:44.958 --> 01:13:47.458
We received a tip that you robbed a bank.

1073
01:13:47.625 --> 01:13:49.333
That's false information.

1074
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:51.708
I paid out my savings.

1075
01:13:51.833 --> 01:13:53.625
The company's. that is.

1076
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:54.875
It's a political matter.

1077
01:13:54.958 --> 01:13:57.000
- Bag the evidence.
- All the money?

1078
01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.625
There was a big transaction.

1079
01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:00.541
What can you possibly know.

1080
01:14:01.791 --> 01:14:05.916
You'll never make even half
of what I have here.

1081
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.375
What about this?

1082
01:14:13.541 --> 01:14:15.250
- Leave it!
- Are those savings too?

1083
01:14:15.291 --> 01:14:16.458
That's the boy's.

1084
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:19.125
Neighbour’s boy's! They play Monopoly!

1085
01:14:19.791 --> 01:14:21.916
He has too many bags at home.

1086
01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:24.291
He stored them here.

1087
01:14:24.458 --> 01:14:27.041
Are you persecuting children now?

1088
01:14:27.333 --> 01:14:29.916
Some big fish. those kids.

1089
01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:32.333
Listen up!

1090
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:35.875
I know what you are up to.

1091
01:14:36.916 --> 01:14:37.916
I don't know how.

1092
01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:39.958
but I will find out.

1093
01:14:41.125 --> 01:14:42.125
Do you know why?

1094
01:14:42.416 --> 01:14:43.541
Because I am hard-headed.

1095
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:46.875
Take everything!

1096
01:14:47.375 --> 01:14:49.083
Lis and his Monopoly too.

1097
01:14:49.208 --> 01:14:52.500
I am an officer of the Polish army!
My father is a general.

1098
01:14:53.083 --> 01:14:55.041
Yes. we know.

1099
01:14:55.875 --> 01:14:59.916
I don't see an officer.
Just a small-time crook

1100
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.791
on a pile of dirty money.

1101
01:15:02.333 --> 01:15:03.333
Take him away.

1102
01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.083
But gentlemen!

1103
01:15:06.583 --> 01:15:07.583
Gentlemen!

1104
01:15:09.125 --> 01:15:11.416
Grab everything!

1105
01:15:27.708 --> 01:15:28.708
Kazik?

1106
01:15:28.916 --> 01:15:30.333
They arrested Karol!

1107
01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:31.875
Do something!

1108
01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:03.166
Easy!

1109
01:16:25.666 --> 01:16:27.333
That was the district commander!

1110
01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:29.125
I know the big man.

1111
01:16:30.333 --> 01:16:31.916
We have to let your suspect go!

1112
01:16:32.458 --> 01:16:35.375
Keep him for 48 hours and send him home.

1113
01:16:36.833 --> 01:16:38.291
But we secured the money!

1114
01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:42.083
- I am so close to a testimony!
- Not anymore!

1115
01:16:44.125 --> 01:16:46.250
Warsaw wanted us
to fight illegal booze!

1116
01:16:47.833 --> 01:16:48.833
Wait a second!

1117
01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:51.333
I don't believe it.

1118
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.750
Are we cops or not?

1119
01:16:54.541 --> 01:16:56.333
Arrest those "King Vodka"-guys.

1120
01:16:56.666 --> 01:16:57.666
They're small time!

1121
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.250
- Posnania is our Al Capone!
- That was an order!

1122
01:17:01.375 --> 01:17:02.625
Leave Posnania be.

1123
01:17:03.333 --> 01:17:04.958
Exhibition
Marzena Pazik

1124
01:17:15.583 --> 01:17:17.458
You should put a band-aid on it.

1125
01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:20.166
Am I under arrest?

1126
01:17:21.916 --> 01:17:25.791
Please. don't be overly dramatic.

1127
01:17:27.333 --> 01:17:28.541
I'm being dramatic now?

1128
01:17:29.083 --> 01:17:30.708
Can't we just talk?

1129
01:17:31.125 --> 01:17:32.333
Do you need help?

1130
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:33.750
No.

1131
01:17:34.291 --> 01:17:35.291
It's fine.

1132
01:17:35.625 --> 01:17:36.916
Put it over there.

1133
01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:49.250
I am not the enemy.

1134
01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:51.250
I am not trying to hurt you.

1135
01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:53.166
I'd like to help you!

1136
01:17:55.291 --> 01:17:58.208
Help me and I'll help both of you.

1137
01:18:00.541 --> 01:18:01.541
How?

1138
01:18:02.083 --> 01:18:04.458
I need something on Lis and Bączek.

1139
01:18:17.416 --> 01:18:18.416
Is that you?

1140
01:18:22.625 --> 01:18:24.291
That cop knows everything!

1141
01:18:25.375 --> 01:18:26.708
Times are changing!

1142
01:18:27.041 --> 01:18:29.041
Soon you'll lose all protection.

1143
01:18:30.125 --> 01:18:31.333
We need to leave.

1144
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.250
Now! No discussion!

1145
01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:35.083
I can't take it no more!

1146
01:18:37.458 --> 01:18:40.125
Either we leave or I leave!

1147
01:18:56.041 --> 01:18:57.041
Marzena.

1148
01:19:03.541 --> 01:19:04.750
I am way ahead of you.

1149
01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:07.250
I've had enough.

1150
01:19:08.791 --> 01:19:11.291
We'll get married and leave.

1151
01:19:11.875 --> 01:19:13.208
Berlin. USA.

1152
01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:16.208
Some remote island.

1153
01:19:17.083 --> 01:19:19.416
And we'll never leave.

1154
01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:21.791
We have enough money.

1155
01:19:23.083 --> 01:19:24.125
Yes!

1156
01:19:27.916 --> 01:19:28.916
Remember!

1157
01:19:30.833 --> 01:19:32.583
This is just in case.

1158
01:19:32.666 --> 01:19:33.791
Emergency only.

1159
01:19:36.166 --> 01:19:37.875
- Got it?
- Yes.

1160
01:19:42.208 --> 01:19:43.208
Finally.

1161
01:19:44.583 --> 01:19:45.583
I love you!

1162
01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:58.583
Excuse me. I am looking for Mrs. Dorota.

1163
01:19:58.666 --> 01:20:01.333
What are you doing here?

1164
01:20:01.791 --> 01:20:03.791
I am buying spirit from you!

1165
01:20:03.958 --> 01:20:05.875
It's good stuff!

1166
01:20:05.958 --> 01:20:06.958
Sells quickly.

1167
01:20:07.083 --> 01:20:09.791
Even President Reagan like it!
Pure!

1168
01:20:10.166 --> 01:20:11.333
I'm in a hurry.

1169
01:20:11.458 --> 01:20:12.708
I sold you spirit.

1170
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:14.916
Good for you!

1171
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.583
I have a second production line!

1172
01:20:16.666 --> 01:20:17.666
Domestic!

1173
01:20:17.916 --> 01:20:19.625
This is how we make money!

1174
01:20:20.083 --> 01:20:23.375
I supply 40 stores!

1175
01:20:23.541 --> 01:20:24.666
Congratulations!

1176
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:26.916
Our product is too expensive!

1177
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.875
That's why we buy your stuff!
It's cheaper!

1178
01:20:30.083 --> 01:20:32.541
To keep the stores open
and people employed!

1179
01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:35.000
I am buying back
what I sold you!

1180
01:20:35.291 --> 01:20:36.833
The invisible hand in economics!

1181
01:20:37.041 --> 01:20:38.291
- Normal thing!
- Normal?

1182
01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:39.750
What is normal about that?

1183
01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.500
I have to go.

1184
01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:46.416
Thank you. sir.

1185
01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:49.708
11 billion złoty. as agreed.

1186
01:20:50.083 --> 01:20:51.375
You're like family to me!

1187
01:20:51.708 --> 01:20:52.708
Antek!

1188
01:20:52.833 --> 01:20:54.541
How much is that in dollars?

1189
01:20:54.625 --> 01:20:56.958
I'm used to counting. but so many zeros…

1190
01:20:57.375 --> 01:20:58.541
Around 1 million.

1191
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:04.000
Here's 2 percent commission.

1192
01:21:04.916 --> 01:21:06.708
Tax. if you like.

1193
01:21:07.333 --> 01:21:08.541
And a racket.

1194
01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:11.125
As they say in the West – excise tax!

1195
01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:13.958
Here's our lost boy!

1196
01:21:14.166 --> 01:21:17.541
Sorry guys. I had a run-in
with the authorities.

1197
01:21:18.291 --> 01:21:20.333
Right. now we're complete.

1198
01:21:21.458 --> 01:21:24.458
I hereby open the monthly
friendly family feud!

1199
01:21:25.083 --> 01:21:26.083
Enjoy yourselves!

1200
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:29.833
Great speech!

1201
01:21:30.333 --> 01:21:31.333
I know!

1202
01:21:35.416 --> 01:21:36.541
Leaving already?

1203
01:21:37.708 --> 01:21:39.125
I don't feel so well.

1204
01:21:39.291 --> 01:21:42.666
But tomorrow is still on?
I have a new exercise VHS!

1205
01:21:42.875 --> 01:21:43.875
Yes.
Bye.

1206
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:46.125
Please tell Kazik we left.

1207
01:21:46.208 --> 01:21:49.458
It'll be a wild night.
He won't even notice.

1208
01:21:49.916 --> 01:21:51.750
Know what? I'll come with you.

1209
01:21:52.541 --> 01:21:54.916
Kazik has to watch over business anyway.

1210
01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:01.166
Girls!

1211
01:22:02.125 --> 01:22:03.250
Leaving already?

1212
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:05.666
- Can you give Edyta a lift?
- Of course.

1213
01:22:06.208 --> 01:22:08.208
I'll be with you in an hour!

1214
01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:10.833
I'll take you.

1215
01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:17.458
Karol! Good to see you!

1216
01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:20.958
Meet our beautiful ladies.

1217
01:22:21.041 --> 01:22:24.041
Żaneta. Monika and Magda!

1218
01:22:24.125 --> 01:22:26.500
I noticed her earlier!

1219
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:27.958
Come back to bed!

1220
01:22:32.166 --> 01:22:33.875
I'm not done with you yet!

1221
01:22:35.625 --> 01:22:37.291
Shouldn't you go back?

1222
01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:39.625
This whole family feud?

1223
01:22:40.708 --> 01:22:42.375
Look after the business?

1224
01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:44.291
Why?

1225
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.833
Let the boys think
they have some authority.

1226
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:51.916
Don't they?

1227
01:22:53.583 --> 01:22:55.916
I am the one running things!

1228
01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.708
They just play bookkeeping.

1229
01:23:00.416 --> 01:23:01.416
And more.

1230
01:23:02.375 --> 01:23:03.958
I like it when you talk like this.

1231
01:23:04.708 --> 01:23:05.708
How?

1232
01:23:06.208 --> 01:23:07.208
Tough.

1233
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.541
Just like…

1234
01:23:10.833 --> 01:23:12.541
There is no "like"!

1235
01:23:14.083 --> 01:23:16.541
I am better and tougher

1236
01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:18.625
than the lot of you!

1237
01:23:34.083 --> 01:23:35.083
Army.

1238
01:23:36.791 --> 01:23:37.791
Then we have

1239
01:23:37.916 --> 01:23:39.791
central trade administrators.

1240
01:23:44.666 --> 01:23:45.666
State police.

1241
01:23:47.041 --> 01:23:48.458
Military intelligence.

1242
01:23:49.833 --> 01:23:51.250
And politicians.

1243
01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.500
So? How about it then?

1244
01:24:01.958 --> 01:24:02.958
And off!

1245
01:24:03.583 --> 01:24:04.583
Look at them.

1246
01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:07.500
As if they had never seen a naked broad.

1247
01:24:08.666 --> 01:24:10.000
Maybe they haven't.

1248
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:15.416
What was that on the phone?
Didn't catch a word.

1249
01:24:28.958 --> 01:24:33.500
Ladies. there's a police raid.
We have to evacuate you.

1250
01:24:34.083 --> 01:24:35.333
Police?

1251
01:24:35.916 --> 01:24:37.041
I can't be seen here!

1252
01:24:37.583 --> 01:24:42.125
I am having breakfast
with Princess Diana!

1253
01:24:42.583 --> 01:24:44.375
Take the ladies out through the rear.

1254
01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:45.625
Let's get going!

1255
01:24:51.958 --> 01:24:55.125
Get the girls and Filip
and go to the next hotel.

1256
01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:57.291
Just make it a decent one!

1257
01:24:57.333 --> 01:24:58.625
It'll be all right. Let's go.

1258
01:25:00.208 --> 01:25:02.041
Mr. Komar will take care of it.

1259
01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.291
I'm still drunk.

1260
01:25:10.041 --> 01:25:11.041
Just remain calm.

1261
01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:14.625
- Where?
- One o'clock.

1262
01:25:15.791 --> 01:25:18.500
Our dearest wives!

1263
01:25:19.166 --> 01:25:22.291
We've been working through the night…

1264
01:25:23.833 --> 01:25:26.166
…with the board of directors.

1265
01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:30.333
About to have breakfast.

1266
01:25:32.458 --> 01:25:34.333
Maybe you could join us?

1267
01:25:35.083 --> 01:25:37.458
Gladly. our dearest husbands!

1268
01:25:37.791 --> 01:25:39.000
Who are you here to see?

1269
01:25:39.791 --> 01:25:41.750
Excellent idea. this family feud!

1270
01:25:43.041 --> 01:25:45.958
Karol. what is that "family feud"?

1271
01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:47.083
It's just…

1272
01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:50.416
Where's that police raid?

1273
01:25:51.791 --> 01:25:53.083
That's the raid?

1274
01:25:53.666 --> 01:25:56.416
Seems worse than the police.

1275
01:25:56.500 --> 01:26:01.208
"Family feud" is the meeting
of store managers.

1276
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.333
We are almost like a big family!

1277
01:26:07.583 --> 01:26:10.833
And the other hotel was crap.

1278
01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:14.333
Filip is abroad. from what I hear?

1279
01:26:14.541 --> 01:26:17.166
And he left us 2 dollars.

1280
01:26:17.625 --> 01:26:18.625
Bye then!

1281
01:26:22.333 --> 01:26:24.041
Four beef tartare. please.

1282
01:26:26.416 --> 01:26:27.416
Karol!

1283
01:26:30.250 --> 01:26:32.041
Cheating is for the competent!

1284
01:26:32.166 --> 01:26:34.458
Our husbands will pay for the cleaning.

1285
01:26:45.916 --> 01:26:46.916
Lead the way!

1286
01:27:05.791 --> 01:27:08.750
Let me introduce you.
Captain Jan Sebastian.

1287
01:27:08.791 --> 01:27:11.083
We have already met.

1288
01:27:21.916 --> 01:27:24.583
I never asked his first name.

1289
01:27:24.916 --> 01:27:27.875
Ladies like men in uniform.
Am I right?

1290
01:27:32.916 --> 01:27:34.750
How dare you cheat on me!

1291
01:27:37.375 --> 01:27:39.333
You sluts!

1292
01:27:41.416 --> 01:27:44.875
How can you not care about the parties?

1293
01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:49.375
We have our own deal.

1294
01:27:49.541 --> 01:27:51.333
He has to look after the business.

1295
01:27:51.708 --> 01:27:53.583
Push your pelvis out.

1296
01:27:54.041 --> 01:27:55.375
That's so pretty!

1297
01:27:57.166 --> 01:27:58.583
Antek gave it to you?

1298
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:02.833
Did he propose?

1299
01:28:04.208 --> 01:28:06.750
Yes. but… don't tell!
It's a secret!

1300
01:28:06.916 --> 01:28:08.500
Sure thing.

1301
01:28:09.041 --> 01:28:11.166
That is great news!

1302
01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.125
Tell me all about it!

1303
01:28:31.041 --> 01:28:32.583
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1304
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.666
Wasn't that Marzena?

1305
01:28:59.416 --> 01:29:00.833
Do you have something to tell me?

1306
01:29:01.208 --> 01:29:02.208
Anything?

1307
01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:12.000
Antek and Marzena have enough.

1308
01:29:12.083 --> 01:29:13.541
They met this stubborn cop

1309
01:29:14.041 --> 01:29:16.500
with ties to Warsaw.

1310
01:29:16.583 --> 01:29:21.041
And he guaranteed them immunity.

1311
01:29:22.541 --> 01:29:24.666
Provided Antek rats on Kazik and Karol.

1312
01:29:28.541 --> 01:29:29.541
And?

1313
01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:34.166
They'll get married. go on honeymoon

1314
01:29:34.208 --> 01:29:35.625
and never come back.

1315
01:29:36.041 --> 01:29:37.041
Live abroad.

1316
01:29:38.083 --> 01:29:39.708
Good job. Sabrina!

1317
01:29:42.416 --> 01:29:43.958
And now the address.

1318
01:30:00.166 --> 01:30:01.666
This country has laws.

1319
01:30:16.916 --> 01:30:18.625
You gave your child away.

1320
01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:22.083
You can't be in touch.

1321
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.416
And I still need you.

1322
01:30:34.541 --> 01:30:37.833
Your time is over!

1323
01:30:44.666 --> 01:30:47.291
Our time is about to begin. Goldilocks!

1324
01:31:24.541 --> 01:31:25.958
There's this saying.

1325
01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:28.375
Lord. protect me from my friends.

1326
01:31:28.541 --> 01:31:30.208
I can take care of my enemies.

1327
01:31:30.291 --> 01:31:31.500
That was the case with Bączek.

1328
01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:34.750
Starczewski told him that we wanted out.

1329
01:31:35.541 --> 01:31:36.958
He had no scruples.

1330
01:32:09.833 --> 01:32:11.125
Antoni Kafer!

1331
01:32:15.791 --> 01:32:18.500
An interesting car
for an interesting man!

1332
01:32:21.083 --> 01:32:22.291
Courtesy of me and Karol.

1333
01:32:22.458 --> 01:32:23.458
All the best!

1334
01:32:25.791 --> 01:32:27.125
Good luck. Marzena!

1335
01:32:28.666 --> 01:32:29.708
Like the colour?

1336
01:32:32.250 --> 01:32:33.666
Do you know how much power it has?

1337
01:32:34.208 --> 01:32:39.458
You have to go 150 km/h to feel it.

1338
01:32:40.583 --> 01:32:43.000
The speedo maxes out at 160.

1339
01:32:43.708 --> 01:32:45.375
Sorry for being late!

1340
01:32:46.791 --> 01:32:48.500
You've met Helena. I believe.

1341
01:32:48.833 --> 01:32:51.208
- I know you!
- I'm pregnant.

1342
01:32:52.083 --> 01:32:53.958
Congratulations!

1343
01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.375
How could this happen?

1344
01:32:58.541 --> 01:33:01.291
I thought you never took the rubber off.

1345
01:33:01.958 --> 01:33:04.333
I am scratching my head over this myself.

1346
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:06.791
What a pimped out ride!

1347
01:33:06.875 --> 01:33:09.083
- Whose is it?
- I guess it's ours now.

1348
01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:10.916
We have to go for a cruise!

1349
01:33:40.875 --> 01:33:42.583
Our last night in Poland.

1350
01:33:59.916 --> 01:34:02.416
We'll leave all the shit behind.

1351
01:34:03.333 --> 01:34:04.375
And we'll have…

1352
01:34:04.458 --> 01:34:05.708
Beautiful children!

1353
01:34:06.125 --> 01:34:07.791
Oh yes!

1354
01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.166
And we shall raise them…

1355
01:34:11.416 --> 01:34:12.833
To be honest people!

1356
01:34:35.708 --> 01:34:37.083
I love you!

1357
01:36:13.625 --> 01:36:15.125
Remember me. wise-ass?

1358
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:17.250
Barely.

1359
01:36:17.333 --> 01:36:19.625
You sold me a fake icon.
I got locked up!

1360
01:36:20.625 --> 01:36:22.125
It's a misunderstanding.

1361
01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:24.291
My marriage was a misunderstanding.

1362
01:36:25.166 --> 01:36:26.375
Go to the police then!

1363
01:36:28.333 --> 01:36:30.875
- I take care of business personally!
- I'm in a hurry.

1364
01:36:34.333 --> 01:36:35.875
You bastard!
Get him!

1365
01:38:17.541 --> 01:38:19.000
The well is dry.

1366
01:38:20.833 --> 01:38:23.250
Next week we're out of business.

1367
01:38:23.333 --> 01:38:24.958
Taxes and customs on booze.

1368
01:38:26.625 --> 01:38:28.041
Prohibition is over.

1369
01:38:29.625 --> 01:38:30.833
Bye. bye. Capone!

1370
01:38:30.916 --> 01:38:31.916
Really?

1371
01:38:32.125 --> 01:38:34.791
Antek is fighting for his life
and all you can think of is booze?

1372
01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:36.083
He's your friend!

1373
01:38:37.458 --> 01:38:38.458
You are right.

1374
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:39.750
Sorry.

1375
01:38:41.583 --> 01:38:45.625
And he had all the passwords.

1376
01:38:46.791 --> 01:38:48.208
To access the money.

1377
01:39:35.625 --> 01:39:36.916
My dearest Marzena!

1378
01:39:37.916 --> 01:39:39.500
If you're reading this.

1379
01:39:39.541 --> 01:39:40.625
things are bad.

1380
01:39:41.291 --> 01:39:42.291
Don't weep.

1381
01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:43.500
Not now.

1382
01:39:44.083 --> 01:39:45.500
There's always time to mourn.

1383
01:39:46.041 --> 01:39:47.291
You have to act now.

1384
01:39:47.583 --> 01:39:48.583
And for that…

1385
01:39:49.291 --> 01:39:50.333
You need money.

1386
01:39:51.375 --> 01:39:54.291
I divided the company's assets
in three equal parts.

1387
01:39:55.041 --> 01:39:57.041
The passwords are hidden at home.

1388
01:39:57.416 --> 01:39:58.458
You know where.

1389
01:39:59.291 --> 01:40:00.541
Now the important part.

1390
01:40:01.166 --> 01:40:04.416
Get your money before you
give the guys their share.

1391
01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:05.500
That is crucial!

1392
01:40:05.583 --> 01:40:07.083
You first. Then them.

1393
01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.041
It's your only chance.

1394
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:12.125
Do it now.
Instantly.

1395
01:40:18.416 --> 01:40:21.500
Life creates the most unbelievable stories.

1396
01:40:21.958 --> 01:40:23.875
This story has a colorful continuation.

1397
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.041
Even though I was convinced my life was over.
