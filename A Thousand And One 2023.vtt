No. you know I was in Rikers.

He at the hospital.

87
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:06.078
The hospital? Why?
What happened?

88
00:06:06.078 --> 00:06:07.663
Running from our foster mother.

89
00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:10.416
Fell out the window. hit his head.

90
00:06:19.174 --> 00:06:20.175
Let me see.

91
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.472

92
00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:29.810
You know. you could've died
doing something like that?

93
00:06:37.818 --> 00:06:39.653
What's wrong with the one I gave you?

94
00:06:39.653 --> 00:06:40.946
It's corny.

95
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.199
All right. well.

96
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.875
What you like?

97
00:06:54.793 --> 00:06:56.503
Power Rangers.

99
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.136
You like her?

100
00:07:09.642 --> 00:07:11.644
She probably gone anyway.

101
00:07:12.478 --> 00:07:15.689
When I was in foster care.
stuff like this happened all the time.

102
00:07:17.942 --> 00:07:19.860
My sister used to look out for me.

103
00:07:20.653 --> 00:07:22.279
But she ran away.

104
00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:23.864
Where's she at now?

105
00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:26.200
I don't know.

106
00:07:28.118 --> 00:07:29.495
I can't find her.

107
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:33.040
My family's gone. boo.

108
00:07:43.384 --> 00:07:46.178
You left me on the street corner?

109
00:07:51.684 --> 00:07:53.560
Who would tell you something like that?

110
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.231
Why the fuck would they tell you
some shit like that?

111
00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:04.071
Get that out your head.

112
00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.836

Want to split this?

118
00:09:11.722 --> 00:09:12.806

Just for a little while.

124
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.583
Um...

131
00:10:10.406 --> 00:10:11.490
When?

132
00:10:15.035 --> 00:10:16.203
I don't know yet.

133
00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:23.627
Why you keep leaving me?

134
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:42.563
Well. that means you have bad luck.

135
00:10:42.563 --> 00:10:47.651
because I'm about to do a karate kick!

136
00:10:48.652 --> 00:10:50.404
Pow! Pow!

137
00:11:25.022 --> 00:11:27.733
Would it make you feel better
if you came to stay with me?

Just for a couple days?

139

You wouldn't have liked him anyway.
I got somebody else in mind.

156

You miss your old friends?

157
00:12:48.689 --> 00:12:50.441
They're not my friends.

158
00:12:51.275 --> 00:12:54.570
Yeah. Sometimes
I feel like I ain't got no friends either.

159
00:12:57.865 --> 00:12:58.866
Except you.

160
00:13:04.204 --> 00:13:05.205
Ugh.

161
00:13:27.937 --> 00:13:29.563
How much longer?

162
00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:35.194

163
00:13:35.194 --> 00:13:36.946

All right. then shut the fuck up

All you got is me. Okay?

Against anybody.

177
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.188
Against this whole fucked-up city.

178
00:14:11.188 --> 00:14:12.564
They can try all they want.

179
00:14:12.564 --> 00:14:15.985
They can try all they want.
but they not breaking us up this time.

180
00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:18.612
You want to find a new home?

181
00:14:19.363 --> 00:14:20.364
Hmm?

182
00:14:20.364 --> 00:14:22.157
Yes.

183
00:14:22.157 --> 00:14:24.451
But I need to know
we in this thing together.

184
00:14:25.286 --> 00:14:26.495
Tell me.

185
00:14:26.495 --> 00:14:29.540
- We're in this together.
- Tell me!

186
00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.333
We're in this together!

187
00:14:55.232 --> 00:14:56.275
<i>Hello?</i>

188
00:14:56.275 --> 00:14:58.277
Kim? Boo. it's Inez.

189
00:14:58.277 --> 00:15:00.529
Oh. my God.
thank God you got the same number.

190
00:15:00.529 --> 00:15:01.989
Listen. I'm uptown.

191
00:15:10.623 --> 00:15:13.584
Y'all go sit in the living room
while I talk to her real quick.

192
00:15:13.584 --> 00:15:15.502
- Is that Ghetto Inez in my living room?
- Shh!

193
00:15:15.502 --> 00:15:17.004
When did you start hanging
with her again?

194
00:15:17.004 --> 00:15:19.465
She's with her son.
Please don't say anything.

195
00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:22.885
She needs a place to stay.

196
00:15:24.511 --> 00:15:26.263
Want to come say hi?

197
00:15:26.263 --> 00:15:28.849
Girl. I'm tired.

198
00:15:31.268 --> 00:15:32.478
For how long?

199
00:15:33.354 --> 00:15:34.813
I don't know.

200
00:15:34.813 --> 00:15:36.857
We'll deal with this tomorrow.

201
00:15:39.443 --> 00:15:41.362
Good morning. sunshine.

202
00:15:43.155 --> 00:15:45.616
If y'all are hungry.
I'ma make breakfast downstairs.

203
00:15:45.616 --> 00:15:47.201
Come on. dance with me.

204
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.956
Oh.

205
00:15:51.956 --> 00:15:54.875
Look at you. Look at you.

206
00:15:57.795 --> 00:15:59.672
You get your GED?

207
00:15:59.672 --> 00:16:02.424
- Inside.
- Really?

208
00:16:02.424 --> 00:16:04.760
Yo. that's fly.

209
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.888
Bruh. you get. like. excited
about the weirdest things.

210
00:16:07.888 --> 00:16:10.099
- I'm proud of you!

211
00:16:10.808 --> 00:16:11.809
So what's your plan?

212
00:16:12.393 --> 00:16:14.853
You up here for good or...

213
00:16:15.396 --> 00:16:18.565
I don't know.
I'm tired of these catty-ass shops.

214
00:16:19.858 --> 00:16:22.486
- Start your own.
- With what money?

215
00:16:22.486 --> 00:16:24.822
What am I supposed to do right now?

216
00:16:24.822 --> 00:16:27.241
Me and my son
need something to eat right now.

217
00:16:28.951 --> 00:16:30.369
Yeah.

218
00:16:30.369 --> 00:16:34.331
You know. I've been meaning
to ask you about Terry.

219
00:16:36.083 --> 00:16:40.004
So. you have him with. uh. Lucky?

220
00:16:43.632 --> 00:16:46.010
Me and Lucky were broken up
when I had T.

221
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.428
He still locked up?

222
00:16:48.262 --> 00:16:49.471
Yeah.

223
00:16:49.471 --> 00:16:51.098
I'll introduce them when he gets out.

224
00:17:00.441 --> 00:17:01.609
The city had him.

225
00:17:01.609 --> 00:17:03.777
He's not supposed
to be with me.

226
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:07.239
Yo. can't you get locked up
for some shit like that?

227
00:17:07.239 --> 00:17:09.157
Not if you keep it to yourself.

228
00:17:15.455 --> 00:17:16.749
Um...

229
00:17:20.961 --> 00:17:22.253
It's safe with me.

230
00:17:31.931 --> 00:17:33.515
Nez. we good.

231
00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:38.354
Look at the cute little dinosaurs.

232
00:17:39.772 --> 00:17:41.732
- They look dumb.
- Okay. no. they don't.

233
00:17:41.732 --> 00:17:43.484
Stop being mean.

234
00:17:45.235 --> 00:17:46.695
She working?

235
00:17:46.695 --> 00:17:48.989
I think she went job hunting today.

236
00:17:49.865 --> 00:17:52.618
You can't go to anybody's place
looking and talking like that.

237
00:17:52.618 --> 00:17:54.078
And all that yakking.

238
00:17:54.078 --> 00:17:55.996
Ma. she can borrow my stuff.

239
00:17:57.456 --> 00:17:59.625
Terry. you like the coloring books. baby?

240
00:18:00.834 --> 00:18:04.380
Good. You know. when I was your age.
my mother taught me how to read.

241
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.006
She spent a lot of time with me.

242
00:18:06.006 --> 00:18:08.592
Well. let me get a loosie. a Big Burst

243
00:18:08.592 --> 00:18:11.011
and some sunflower seeds.

00:18:25.484 --> 00:18:27.278
I don't know that story.

250
00:18:27.278 --> 00:18:29.488
All right. matter of fact.
let me get a newspaper too.

251

254
00:18:50.926 --> 00:18:53.053

you keep Terry in your sight.

255
00:18:53.053 --> 00:18:55.097
-<i>Don't let him out of your sight.</i>
- What?

256
00:18:55.889 --> 00:18:57.766
Just keep him in the house.

257
00:18:57.766 --> 00:19:01.145
- Inez. where are you?
-<i>Just do it! Please. Kim!</i>

- Of course.

260
00:19:10.404 --> 00:19:12.072
- She say where she was at?
- Uh-uh.

261
00:19:12.072 --> 00:19:14.950
Doesn't make sense. It doesn't
take this long to look for work.

262
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:17.411
You like to play games. Terry?
- This is ridiculous.

263
00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.248
So quiet.

264
00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:25.836
Who's hiding in there?

265
00:19:29.423 --> 00:19:30.591
Mmm?

266
00:19:35.262 --> 00:19:36.764
I found work.

267
00:19:43.729 --> 00:19:45.856
Come on. boo.
so you can try these on.

268
00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:49.944
You like 'em?

269
00:19:51.654 --> 00:19:53.238
They're too big.

270
00:19:53.989 --> 00:19:55.282
You'll grow into them.

271
00:19:57.201 --> 00:19:58.786
Why don't you take 'em upstairs?

272
00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:06.752
Kim. check the stove for me. please.

273
00:20:07.294 --> 00:20:08.629

Can you just at least
act like you see me here?

277
00:20:19.014 --> 00:20:22.268
Exactly what do you expect
and want from me?

278
00:20:23.018 --> 00:20:24.937
Strolling in here
after being God-knows-where...

279
00:20:24.937 --> 00:20:26.146
Doing what I had to.

280
00:20:26.146 --> 00:20:28.148
Like some kind of streetwalker.

281
00:20:28.941 --> 00:20:30.609
What the fuck did you just call me?

282
00:20:30.609 --> 00:20:32.278
Shit.

283
00:20:32.278 --> 00:20:33.696
Run that back again.

284
00:20:33.696 --> 00:20:35.114
Ma. Inez...

285
00:20:35.114 --> 00:20:38.325
You always treated me like I'm not
good enough to be around your daughter.

286
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:41.870
Whatever you think of me.
just spit it out!

287
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.956
I don't think anything of you.

288
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.085
- Inez. what's up with you?
- What!

289
00:20:48.085 --> 00:20:50.337
- What!
- No! I'm fine.

290
00:20:50.879 --> 00:20:52.840
- Glass almost cut my foot.

291
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.676
Turning my house
into damn 125th Street.

292
00:20:56.635 --> 00:20:58.512
- Ma!
- No. no.

293
00:21:02.016 --> 00:21:04.476
The hell are you teaching
that little boy up there?

294
00:21:06.687 --> 00:21:09.773
Twenty-two years old.
acting like a child.

295
00:21:09.773 --> 00:21:13.027
You want them to take you serious.
be from Harlem. not of Harlem.

296
00:21:16.196 --> 00:21:17.531
So that's it?

297
00:21:18.198 --> 00:21:20.284
You don't have nothing else to say?

298
00:21:23.704 --> 00:21:25.205
- I said I was...
- To me!

299
00:21:28.709 --> 00:21:30.753
Was I wrong? Yes.

300
00:21:30.753 --> 00:21:34.465
But what else do you want me to say?
That I'm nothing? A streetwalker?

301
00:21:34.465 --> 00:21:37.676
You can't keep fighting
everyone you disagree with.

302
00:21:38.177 --> 00:21:40.304
We got to grow up.

303
00:21:40.304 --> 00:21:42.973
Okay. look. my mom's gonna be
who she's gonna be. but. like...

304
00:21:42.973 --> 00:21:44.516
But. like. what?

305
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.563
When are you going to realize
that you are enough?

306
00:21:49.563 --> 00:21:51.357
Who cares what she says?

307
00:21:51.357 --> 00:21:54.818
Why even let any of that shit get to you?

308
00:22:00.407 --> 00:22:01.408
She...

309
00:22:03.452 --> 00:22:05.287
She said I was a bad mother.

310
00:22:10.125 --> 00:22:12.586
Come here. Come here.

311
00:22:20.427 --> 00:22:23.013
She forgets you don't have one.

312
00:22:30.562 --> 00:22:31.563
Hey. you.

313
00:22:32.356 --> 00:22:34.900
You better get that chip
off your shoulder.

314
00:22:36.277 --> 00:22:37.611
I know you hear me.

315
00:22:40.155 --> 00:22:41.156
Come on.

316
00:22:46.078 --> 00:22:48.455
All right. promise me
you're gonna be good for Mommy?

317
00:23:17.484 --> 00:23:18.652
T. don't go up.

318
00:23:20.487 --> 00:23:22.573
We don't really know anybody here.

319
00:23:25.326 --> 00:23:26.327
I lied.

320
00:23:33.334 --> 00:23:35.002
Don't look at me like that.

321
00:23:35.002 --> 00:23:36.170
Get off me.

322
00:23:37.504 --> 00:23:40.299
- Why you being mean to me?
- 'Cause you keep fucking up!

323
00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:41.926
Ow!

324
00:23:41.926 --> 00:23:43.844
Who said you could talk to me like that?

325
00:23:43.844 --> 00:23:46.597
- I liked them!
- Okay. well. yeah. What about me?

326
00:23:46.597 --> 00:23:48.140
What about me. Terry?

327
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.851
Some shit is more important
than some coloring books.

328
00:23:59.652 --> 00:24:01.070
I didn't mean to hurt you.

329
00:24:09.787 --> 00:24:11.538
- Wait right here.

330
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:24.301
<i>Hey. this is Wanda.</i>

331
00:24:24.301 --> 00:24:26.720
<i>Leave a message after the beep.

- Hi. This Cynthia?

333
00:24:51.662 --> 00:24:53.247
-<i>Who this</i>?
- Listen. I need a favor.

334
00:24:53.247 --> 00:24:54.748
-<i>What?</i>
- The building that I'm living in.

335
00:24:54.748 --> 00:24:56.667
it got asbestos.
and they cleared everybody out.

336
00:24:56.667 --> 00:24:58.419
<i>Inez. I'm sorry. You can't stay here.</i>

337

<i>The number you are calling
is no longer in service.</i>

338

<i>Hello.</i>
- It's your old hairdresser. Inez.

339
00:25:05.134 --> 00:25:06.552
-<i>You said who?</i>
- Just give me the address.

340
00:25:06.552 --> 00:25:08.554
- and we'll come by later. Terry!
-<i>I did not say...</i>

341
00:25:13.392 --> 00:25:15.227
Terry. are you crazy?
Where were you going!

342
00:25:15.227 --> 00:25:17.396
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Are you crazy?

343
00:25:17.396 --> 00:25:18.939
- Our stuff was in there!

344
00:25:56.602 --> 00:25:58.395
I can't go back to that shelter.

345
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.981
How long you been
on the street?

346
00:26:02.107 --> 00:26:03.108
Long enough.

347
00:26:05.986 --> 00:26:07.112
Where are your people?

348
00:26:12.284 --> 00:26:13.285
Gone.

349
00:26:13.911 --> 00:26:14.912
Gone where?

350
00:26:15.704 --> 00:26:17.206
You from up here?

351
00:26:19.792 --> 00:26:20.918
I lost 'em.

352
00:26:21.835 --> 00:26:23.045
Lost them how?

353
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:34.682
Yeah.

354
00:26:35.683 --> 00:26:37.059
You and the rest of us.

355
00:26:40.521 --> 00:26:42.648
My baby girl's still struggling.

356
00:26:42.648 --> 00:26:45.192
Her son's about the same age
as your little boy.

357
00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:49.530
Pea?

358
00:26:51.073 --> 00:26:52.283
Pea?

359
00:26:52.283 --> 00:26:54.660
You can take the little room
on the second floor.

360
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.786
Yes?

361
00:26:55.786 --> 00:26:58.622
Clear your things
from Sadie's old room. Mmm?

362
00:26:58.622 --> 00:27:00.040
- Okay?
- Okay.

363
00:27:01.083 --> 00:27:02.835
And like I tell all my tenants.

364
00:27:03.544 --> 00:27:05.713
try anything. I keep a .44 ready.

365
00:27:07.631 --> 00:27:09.425
Go show him where to go. baby.

366
00:27:09.425 --> 00:27:10.551
Is this your house?

367
00:27:13.178 --> 00:27:15.889
Ooh!

368
00:27:16.557 --> 00:27:17.933
Mmm!

369
00:27:17.933 --> 00:27:19.184
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

370
00:27:19.184 --> 00:27:21.520
Mmm. Girl.

371
00:27:22.062 --> 00:27:23.564
It's nothing.

372
00:27:23.564 --> 00:27:25.399
Does that mean
I don't have to pay you?

373
00:27:27.568 --> 00:27:28.569
Well...

374
00:27:29.695 --> 00:27:31.530
Girl. I feel like something.

375
00:27:40.873 --> 00:27:42.791
- Thank you. sweetie.
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:27:47.004 --> 00:27:48.756
I can't even get it this time.

377
00:27:48.756 --> 00:27:50.466
Where does the rent go?

378
00:27:50.466 --> 00:27:51.800
That-- No.

379
00:27:52.635 --> 00:27:54.762
Just leave it right there.

380
00:27:55.429 --> 00:27:57.014
Got him.

381
00:27:57.014 --> 00:27:58.390
Yeah.

382
00:27:59.433 --> 00:28:00.434
Oh. no. wait.

383
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.104
- You ever see her?
Who? Oh. Crystal?

384
00:28:04.104 --> 00:28:05.439
Yeah. your daughter.

385
00:28:06.065 --> 00:28:07.066
She. um...

386
00:28:09.109 --> 00:28:11.445
She's cleaned up a few times.

387
00:28:12.071 --> 00:28:13.739
That's a battle I can't fight.

388
00:28:15.282 --> 00:28:17.576
She'll come home for good
when she's ready.

389
00:28:21.664 --> 00:28:23.958
By the way.
if you're still looking for better money.

390
00:28:23.958 --> 00:28:28.712
uh. a friend of mine
might have a job for you.

391
00:28:28.712 --> 00:28:30.631
Really? Where at?

392
00:28:30.631 --> 00:28:33.217
Cleaning staff for a nursing home
on Jamaica Avenue.

393
00:28:33.217 --> 00:28:34.969
- In Queens?
- Yes. Queens.

394
00:28:34.969 --> 00:28:36.428
That's. like. a two-hour train ride.

395
00:28:36.428 --> 00:28:39.515
Well...
...do what you want.

396
00:28:39.515 --> 00:28:42.184
Just don't waste anymore time
feeling sorry for yourself.

397
00:28:47.481 --> 00:28:50.567
Your generation don't know
just how good you have it.

398
00:28:58.951 --> 00:29:01.870
<i>Jaywalking is a fact of life here.</i>

399
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:03.872
<i>"No more." says Mayor Giuliani.</i>

400
00:29:03.872 --> 00:29:05.916
<i>He plans to crack down on pedestrians</i>

401
00:29:05.916 --> 00:29:08.127
<i>who cross where and when
they're not supposed to.</i>

402
00:29:08.127 --> 00:29:10.004
I'll walk where I want to walk!
Motherfucker...

403
00:29:10.004 --> 00:29:11.547
<i>Plan with me</i>

{\an8}<i>that will actually make people's lives</i>

406
00:29:16.927 --> 00:29:18.887
<i>better than they are right now.</i>

407
00:29:18.887 --> 00:29:21.348
<i>and work hard with me</i>

408
00:29:21.348 --> 00:29:25.185

<i>Dream. believe.</i>

410
00:29:28.939 --> 00:29:31.275
<i>plan and work.</i>

411
00:29:31.275 --> 00:29:35.154
<i>This is the foundation
for the process of change.</i>

412
00:29:49.251 --> 00:29:50.669
Say. "Hi. Mommy."

413
00:29:51.378 --> 00:29:53.047
- Hey.
- Hi.

414
00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:56.175
Tell Mommy what books we read today.

415
00:29:57.509 --> 00:29:58.594
Hey. girl.

416
00:30:12.191 --> 00:30:13.317
The dash is missing.

417
00:30:13.984 --> 00:30:14.985
Huh?

418
00:30:17.404 --> 00:30:18.822
Never mind.

419
00:30:25.955 --> 00:30:27.498
Yo. how much they charge you?

420
00:30:28.248 --> 00:30:30.668
- 350.
- Okay.

421
00:30:30.668 --> 00:30:32.211
You did good. babe.

422
00:30:34.588 --> 00:30:36.257
How you like the job?

423
00:30:39.802 --> 00:30:41.262
I miss doing hair.

424
00:30:45.391 --> 00:30:47.059
He back in school yet?

425
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:49.311
Hand me a screw.

426
00:30:56.568 --> 00:30:59.405
Got to get a copy
of his birth certificate and all that.

427
00:31:02.116 --> 00:31:04.285
I. um. started applying too.

428
00:31:05.953 --> 00:31:07.997
I'm going to Clark Atlanta in the fall.

429
00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:11.875
- You leaving us?
- I wouldn't say it like that.

430
00:31:18.966 --> 00:31:21.010
I'm happy for you.

431
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:22.428
You could go back too.

432
00:31:23.762 --> 00:31:26.223
Even if it's part-time
or something like that.

433
00:31:28.142 --> 00:31:29.768
Yeah. someday.

434
00:31:35.024 --> 00:31:36.066
All right. baby.

435
00:31:36.066 --> 00:31:39.695
You got cereal and milk.
Leftovers is in the fridge.

436
00:31:39.695 --> 00:31:42.197
And don't heat it up
for over 60 seconds.

437
00:31:42.197 --> 00:31:44.074
'cause if you do.
your mouth will get burnt.

438
00:31:44.074 --> 00:31:46.994
And do not answer the door for anybody.

439
00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.829
If the phone rings.

440
00:31:48.829 --> 00:31:51.332
wait for the answering machine
to come on to see if it's me.

441
00:31:53.459 --> 00:31:54.543
Okay?

442
00:31:56.503 --> 00:31:58.505
I'll be back from work around 6:00.

443
00:32:08.057 --> 00:32:09.058
Okay?

444
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.601
Be good. boo.

445
00:32:33.666 --> 00:32:37.002
<i>Today the streets
are even more dangerous than you think.</i>

446
00:32:37.002 --> 00:32:38.462
<i>You like flying?</i>

447
00:32:38.462 --> 00:32:41.465
<i>I got something
that'll really make you fly.</i>

448
00:32:41.465 --> 00:32:43.467
<i>So talk to your kids
about drugs. or...</i>

449
00:33:04.071 --> 00:33:06.490
<i>Quincy Jones has made his mark in music</i>

450
00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.493
<i>as a composer. conductor
and arranger</i>

451
00:33:09.493 --> 00:33:11.787
<i>during a time
when it was almost unheard of</i>

452
00:33:11.787 --> 00:33:14.415
<i>for a Black composer
to do a Hollywood movie.</i>

453
00:33:15.249 --> 00:33:19.128
<i>The imagination's always been
a comfort zone. safety zone. really.</i>

454
00:33:19.128 --> 00:33:22.506
<i>because it's something you can run to</i>

455
00:33:22.506 --> 00:33:25.092
<i>and make it anything you want. really.</i>

456
00:33:46.405 --> 00:33:47.406
This house look--

457
00:33:52.369 --> 00:33:53.412
Everything okay?

458
00:33:59.126 --> 00:34:01.462
Why nobody looking for me?

459
00:34:04.798 --> 00:34:06.884
Because we made it too hard for them.

460
00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:10.804
That was the whole point. remember?

461
00:34:16.142 --> 00:34:17.144
Come here.

462
00:34:25.986 --> 00:34:26.987
Hey.

463
00:34:32.618 --> 00:34:33.619
Look.

464
00:34:34.495 --> 00:34:36.622
I don't know what the fuck to tell you. T.

465
00:34:37.665 --> 00:34:40.209
But there's more to life
than fucked-up beginnings.

466
00:34:44.588 --> 00:34:46.173
You're not holding it right!

467
00:34:47.548 --> 00:34:49.677
Hey. talk to me nice. I got this.

468
00:34:51.135 --> 00:34:52.095
You ready?

469
00:34:52.095 --> 00:34:53.805
You ready-ready?

470
00:34:57.517 --> 00:34:58.936
Yeah!

471
00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:01.105
You did it! You did it! You did it!

472
00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:06.360
You gonna throw it all the way over--

473
00:35:10.572 --> 00:35:12.324
Throw that thing better than that.

474
00:35:18.789 --> 00:35:21.375
Now you just being lazy.

475
00:35:23.377 --> 00:35:24.378
You ready?

476
00:35:25.796 --> 00:35:26.797
Yeah.

477
00:35:27.756 --> 00:35:28.799
Mmm.

478
00:35:32.469 --> 00:35:33.637
Ooh!

479
00:35:33.637 --> 00:35:35.347
Okay. yeah. you did it.

480
00:35:37.933 --> 00:35:40.019
I never had my own room growing up.

481
00:35:40.936 --> 00:35:42.187
You wanna try?

482
00:35:43.147 --> 00:35:44.815
Who lived here before us?

483
00:35:45.899 --> 00:35:47.651
I don't know. A bunch of immigrants.

484
00:35:47.651 --> 00:35:49.987
- And before them?
- I don't know. baby.

485
00:35:49.987 --> 00:35:52.072
We can go to the library
and look it up.

486
00:35:53.282 --> 00:35:56.493
Down and up. Down--

487
00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.922
Who's that?

488
00:36:12.635 --> 00:36:13.969
This is me.

489
00:36:14.845 --> 00:36:17.222
When I was first coming out
of the group home.

490
00:36:18.057 --> 00:36:19.183
Cute little thing.

491
00:36:23.854 --> 00:36:26.899
My body was a playground for
a thousand niggas before you came along.

492
00:36:26.899 --> 00:36:28.317
- That's nasty.

493
00:36:28.317 --> 00:36:29.860
Hey. I got more of us.

494
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.321
but things get lost
when we moving around so much.

495
00:36:32.321 --> 00:36:34.281
Yo. Open up.
- Hold on. hold on.

496
00:36:35.324 --> 00:36:36.533
It's Rudy.

497
00:36:38.285 --> 00:36:39.954
- Hello.
- Hey.

498
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.753
My bad I'm late.
Some of the papers took longer to get.

499
00:36:47.753 --> 00:36:49.713
What if he needs to go
to the doctor?

500
00:36:49.713 --> 00:36:52.049
Just show up and say he's sick.

501
00:36:52.049 --> 00:36:54.176
And I got one for the city
so it looks legit.

502
00:36:54.176 --> 00:36:55.261
Okay.

Okay. I went with Daryl.

We just moved in from Jersey.

508
00:37:14.321 --> 00:37:16.615
- Your middle name is Terry.

509
00:37:16.615 --> 00:37:18.117
I don't like it.

510
00:37:21.954 --> 00:37:22.955
Hi. Kim.

511
00:37:26.709 --> 00:37:27.960

512
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.255
<i>...three. two. one. Now!</i>

513
00:37:46.687 --> 00:37:47.688
That's him?

514
00:37:53.277 --> 00:37:55.321
Why you standing there
looking scared?

515
00:37:59.366 --> 00:38:02.369
Neighbor down the hall
walks him home for me after school.

516
00:38:04.496 --> 00:38:06.749
Terry. I want you to meet Lucky.

517
00:38:13.213 --> 00:38:14.214
Hey. Lucky.

518
00:38:15.883 --> 00:38:17.217
What's up. little man?

519
00:38:17.927 --> 00:38:19.887
Lucky's gonna be moving in with us.

520
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.890
For how long?

521
00:38:24.892 --> 00:38:26.018
Damn.

522
00:38:29.229 --> 00:38:32.149
Little nigga trying
to kick me out already.

523
00:38:32.149 --> 00:38:33.400
Come here.

524
00:38:40.074 --> 00:38:41.575

Let me get one for good luck. babe.

You can get a shot. You want a shot?
You can get a shot. Go ahead. Take a shot.

528
00:38:57.675 --> 00:38:59.927

Yeah. get it. Pea!

530
00:39:01.095 --> 00:39:02.680
- Pea. out! Pea. out!
Out of my kitchen!

531
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.140
- Out of my kitchen!
Look at the D! Look at the D!

532
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.934
Good job. Pea.

533
00:39:09.937 --> 00:39:11.730
Shoot! Pass it. Pass it.

534
00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.190
- Let me get another.
- No.

535
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:14.275
Pass it.

536
00:39:16.277 --> 00:39:17.695
Want to go again?

537
00:39:20.239 --> 00:39:21.615
What's wrong?

538
00:39:36.964 --> 00:39:38.382
Where was he before?

539
00:39:40.092 --> 00:39:41.927
How many times
you gonna ask me that?

540
00:39:41.927 --> 00:39:43.095
Till I get an answer.

541
00:39:46.098 --> 00:39:48.309
He belongs with his mother.

542
00:39:49.143 --> 00:39:50.436
Nobody's even looking for him.

543
00:39:51.145 --> 00:39:53.564
Course they're not looking for him
because they're looking for me.

544
00:39:53.564 --> 00:39:56.317
And every other nigga round here
with a target on they back.

545
00:39:56.817 --> 00:39:59.194
Hey. how many times
I been locked up for you. Lucky?

546
00:39:59.194 --> 00:40:00.821
I just got out. man!

547
00:40:01.822 --> 00:40:04.241
Trying to move on from all that shit.

548
00:40:04.241 --> 00:40:07.328
Do you remember what it felt like
to grow up without a father?

549
00:40:10.623 --> 00:40:13.500
Just want us to be a family. That's all.

550
00:40:15.461 --> 00:40:17.046
That's not my fucking kid.

551
00:40:19.798 --> 00:40:21.175
I just wanted you.

552
00:40:26.013 --> 00:40:27.598
But you fucked up in the head.

553
00:40:27.598 --> 00:40:30.351
Yeah. nuts for thinking
you would fucking understand.

554
00:40:30.351 --> 00:40:32.227
I didn't sign up for this shit.

555
00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.820
{\an8}"You are not a cow."

556
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.950
{\an8}"You are not a boat
or a plane or a snore."

557
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:47.618
{\an8}-"Snort."
-"Snort."

558
00:40:48.577 --> 00:40:51.622
{\an8}- Stop.
-<i>"You are not a boat."</i>

559
00:40:51.622 --> 00:40:53.791
{\an8}-"Or..."
-"Or a plane

560
00:40:53.791 --> 00:40:55.626
{\an8}- or a snort."
-"Snort."

561
00:40:57.878 --> 00:40:59.713
"You are my mother."

562
00:40:59.713 --> 00:41:02.299
"You are a bird.

563
00:41:02.299 --> 00:41:03.968
{\an8}and you are my mother."

564
00:41:03.968 --> 00:41:05.386
{\an8}Yeah.

565
00:41:06.053 --> 00:41:09.098
"And you are my mother.

566
00:41:09.098 --> 00:41:11.684
And you are my mother.
And you are..."

567
00:41:51.056 --> 00:41:54.101
I literally saw you look at her
with my own eyes.

568
00:41:56.437 --> 00:41:58.063
Is it 'cause she lighter than me?

569
00:41:58.939 --> 00:42:01.191
- 'Cause her hair's nicer?
- You're too sensitive.

570
00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:03.402
Well. then just be sensitive
to my sensitivity.

571
00:42:08.907 --> 00:42:10.784
Where'd you stay this whole time?

572
00:42:12.119 --> 00:42:14.163
Was posted up with Mike.

573
00:42:14.163 --> 00:42:17.082
- That bike not hot. is it?
- No.

574
00:42:20.753 --> 00:42:21.795
One.

575
00:42:25.132 --> 00:42:26.842
All right.
I need another can of broth.

576
00:42:29.011 --> 00:42:30.721
Come on. let me do that after the game.

577
00:42:30.721 --> 00:42:32.640
No. Can you go now?

578
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:35.309
And why don't you take Terry with you?

579
00:42:59.583 --> 00:43:01.168
How you doing. Lucky?

580
00:43:01.168 --> 00:43:03.379
I'm good. 'Licia.
How you doing. shorty?

581
00:43:03.379 --> 00:43:04.588
You should call me.

582
00:43:10.302 --> 00:43:11.762
Do me a favor.

583
00:43:11.762 --> 00:43:13.555
Walk on this side of me.

584
00:43:14.682 --> 00:43:16.058
It's for your protection.

585
00:43:23.148 --> 00:43:24.525
You always this quiet?

586
00:43:28.404 --> 00:43:29.822
Sometimes.

587
00:43:30.447 --> 00:43:32.157
And what you thinking about?

588
00:43:34.368 --> 00:43:35.869
Well. it sounds like a lot.

589
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:40.708
How did you get that name Lucky?

590
00:43:42.918 --> 00:43:44.712
Made a few mistakes. that's all.

591
00:43:45.713 --> 00:43:47.339
That's a story for another time.

592
00:43:48.382 --> 00:43:51.594
- And I'm a mistake too?
- Who told you that?

593
00:43:51.594 --> 00:43:53.637
It's why you don't want me around.

594
00:43:53.637 --> 00:43:54.722
That's not true.

595
00:43:57.057 --> 00:43:58.058
You're a blessing.

596
00:43:58.851 --> 00:44:00.352
For your mom especially.

597
00:44:02.062 --> 00:44:03.105
Everything is just...

598
00:44:06.233 --> 00:44:07.693
just complicated.

599
00:44:09.194 --> 00:44:10.988
Aight? Come on.

600
00:44:23.208 --> 00:44:24.668
How'd you get that one?

601
00:44:31.258 --> 00:44:33.010
Guy cut me with a knife.

602
00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:34.094
Why?

603
00:44:42.061 --> 00:44:43.479
He wanted something I took.

604
00:45:00.496 --> 00:45:01.705
You see this one right here?

605
00:45:02.957 --> 00:45:03.958
See it?

606
00:45:06.168 --> 00:45:07.711
On the East Side.

607
00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:10.297
everybody hide they box cutters
right here.

608
00:45:10.839 --> 00:45:12.216
It hurt?

609
00:45:14.802 --> 00:45:16.178
Yeah. a little bit.

610
00:45:22.893 --> 00:45:25.646
<i>HOT 97.</i>

611
00:45:34.613 --> 00:45:36.407
Everything's changing.

612
00:45:37.324 --> 00:45:38.742
A couple of years from now.

613
00:45:38.742 --> 00:45:41.120
we're not gonna have to worry
about this at all.

614
00:45:57.219 --> 00:46:00.097
What do two crooks know
about raising a family?

615
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:11.358
<i>Yeah!</i>

616
00:46:12.192 --> 00:46:13.319
<i>Yes!</i>

617
00:46:13.319 --> 00:46:14.862

Yes. girl. show me the ring!
Okay! All right!

623
00:46:29.043 --> 00:46:30.544
What the ring like?

624
00:46:31.086 --> 00:46:33.130
That's exactly

But I want you to know

00:46:56.028 --> 00:46:57.696

You scared

00:47:06.747 --> 00:47:07.957
No.

637
00:47:09.583 --> 00:47:11.710
Nobody's going anywhere.
from this point on.

638
00:47:13.754 --> 00:47:15.714
I promise
to protect you and your mother.

639
00:47:16.882 --> 00:47:17.925
You understand?

640
00:47:18.926 --> 00:47:19.969
Yes.

641
00:47:20.928 --> 00:47:23.180
We're gonna give you

Aight? You hear me?

643

Mmm?

Come here.

645
00:47:37.778 --> 00:47:40.531
Up-up-up. There we go. There we go.

646
00:47:40.531 --> 00:47:42.783
Girl. you got you a family now.

647
00:47:42.783 --> 00:47:45.327
Whoo!

648

King of the world!

649
00:47:47.621 --> 00:47:48.664
Aw.

We got to get this.
Hold on. hold on. Here we go.

651
00:47:50.666 --> 00:47:51.959
Wait.

653
00:47:53.836 --> 00:47:54.962
Ah!

Say. "Family!"

Family.

656
00:48:04.763 --> 00:48:06.265
I'm so happy for y'all.

657
00:48:21.989 --> 00:48:23.157
Let me see.

658
00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:42.760
What you want to hear?

659
00:48:43.802 --> 00:48:45.846
- That one.

660
00:48:46.764 --> 00:48:49.516
<i>If Federal Court
lets new zoning laws take effect.</i>

661
00:48:49.516 --> 00:48:50.601
<i>starting today.</i>

662
00:48:50.601 --> 00:48:53.646
<i>42nd Street will have
to take on a different look. or else.</i>

663
00:48:53.646 --> 00:48:56.065
<i>According to the mayor.
the crackdown on low-level offenses</i>

664
00:48:56.065 --> 00:48:57.274
<i>is a quality-of-life issue.</i>

665
00:48:57.274 --> 00:48:59.652
<i>If you change. in fact.</i>

666
00:48:59.652 --> 00:49:01.695
<i>the true nature of the establishment.</i>

667
00:49:01.695 --> 00:49:03.530
<i>then you probably have a defense
under the law.</i>

668
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:05.407
Turn it up!
<i>Today. at 11:00.</i>

669
00:49:05.407 --> 00:49:07.242
<i>the police officer said
he sodomized Abner Louima</i>

<i>in the presence of another officer.</i>

671
00:49:08.535 --> 00:49:10.746
<i>although. he did not implicate
any of the four other officers.</i>

672
00:49:10.746 --> 00:49:13.332
<i>...there are serious questions
about police practice and race.</i>

673

679

680
00:49:30.766 --> 00:49:32.810

<i>stop-question-frisk.</i>

682
00:49:41.443 --> 00:49:42.444

Them shorties
don't want you.

690
00:49:56.792 --> 00:49:59.795
No. nigga. that's standards.
Don't fault me for caring about my heart.

691
00:50:01.714 --> 00:50:02.715
Go get that!

692
00:50:04.758 --> 00:50:06.844
Nah. Nah.

693
00:50:06.844 --> 00:50:08.512
- I'm good.
-"Nah." Keep not listening.

694
00:50:08.512 --> 00:50:09.680
I am listening!

695
00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.557
See how they respond
to that nice shit. man?

696
00:50:11.557 --> 00:50:14.393
- What's good with that?
- I just got my own style.

697
00:50:14.393 --> 00:50:16.604
Since when is "bum nigga" a style?

698
00:50:16.604 --> 00:50:18.939
Hey. hey! You. you. Now.
Up against the wall. right now.

699
00:50:18.939 --> 00:50:20.691
Yeah. just put your hands
where I can see 'em.

700
00:50:20.691 --> 00:50:22.901
- Don't make any sudden move.
Damn. bro.

701
00:50:22.901 --> 00:50:24.153
Thought you looked older.

702
00:50:24.153 --> 00:50:26.530
<i>Daryl can be a little aloof sometimes.</i>

703

He daydreams a lot.

704
00:50:28.365 --> 00:50:31.285
But. overall. he's a very bright kid.

705
00:50:31.285 --> 00:50:33.787
I was surprised to see
that you were his mother.

706
00:50:33.787 --> 00:50:37.750
Most of our students here
aren't as articulate.

707
00:50:40.628 --> 00:50:42.379
Oh. is that so?

708
00:50:42.379 --> 00:50:45.716
To be honest. Mrs. Raymond. um.

709
00:50:46.842 --> 00:50:48.969
I don't think Daryl belongs here.

710
00:50:50.054 --> 00:50:54.016
Have you thought about applying
to the specialized high schools?

711
00:50:55.267 --> 00:50:56.268
No.

712
00:50:56.977 --> 00:50:58.771
I'd like you to meet Ms. Tucker.

713
00:50:58.771 --> 00:51:00.105
Hi.

714
00:51:00.105 --> 00:51:02.816
She's a counselor
at Tech. Science and Leadership.

715
00:51:02.816 --> 00:51:05.736
I also run an outreach program
on the side

716
00:51:05.736 --> 00:51:08.489
to get more students like Daryl
to take the test.

717
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:11.992
Would you be open to that. Daryl?

718
00:51:14.536 --> 00:51:16.038
If they got girls.

719
00:51:17.164 --> 00:51:21.585
A lot of the kids
go on to MIT. Harvard.

720
00:51:21.585 --> 00:51:23.712
It might take some getting used to.

721
00:51:23.712 --> 00:51:26.465
There wouldn't be as many minorities.

722
00:51:26.465 --> 00:51:28.092
Ma. you know
the laundromat shut down?

723
00:51:28.092 --> 00:51:30.094
Yeah. They sold the building.

724
00:51:30.094 --> 00:51:31.679
So. where we supposed to go?

725
00:51:32.513 --> 00:51:35.307
Go down to Ramirez.
What's a couple of blocks?

726
00:51:36.016 --> 00:51:37.518
I don't like going over there.

727
00:51:38.477 --> 00:51:39.478
Well...

728
00:51:41.438 --> 00:51:42.898
We got stopped by the cops again.

729
00:51:45.401 --> 00:51:47.403
Um. were they looking for someone?

730
00:51:47.403 --> 00:51:48.487
I don't know.

731
00:51:49.113 --> 00:51:50.489
Did they take your name?

732
00:51:51.365 --> 00:51:52.366
No.

733
00:51:52.908 --> 00:51:55.202
I'm just calling it out
so you know it ain't me.

734
00:51:57.371 --> 00:52:00.040
Girl. and then
he talk about he want to move in.

735
00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.709
I'm like. "Are you paying half the rent?"

736
00:52:01.709 --> 00:52:04.128
- Hey. girl. How you doing?
- Hey. girl. what's up?

737
00:52:04.128 --> 00:52:05.754
Hello.

738
00:52:05.754 --> 00:52:07.631
Girl. so you know.
like. I'm a woman.

739
00:52:07.631 --> 00:52:10.134
I shouldn't be paying rent
if a man stay here.

740
00:52:10.134 --> 00:52:12.428
- You know what I'm saying?
- What's going on over there?

741
00:52:12.428 --> 00:52:13.887
Girl. you know
they bought the building.

742
00:52:15.723 --> 00:52:18.142
But anyway. girl.
what you think I should do. though?

743
00:52:18.142 --> 00:52:20.978
You think I should.
like. split the rent?

744
00:52:20.978 --> 00:52:22.271
Girl. I don't know.

745
00:52:22.271 --> 00:52:24.523
Right. 'cause I ain't doing that.

746
00:52:31.488 --> 00:52:33.073
Ah!
- Scared me half to death!

747
00:52:33.073 --> 00:52:35.075
- Here. let me get that.
- Anything else?

748
00:52:36.535 --> 00:52:37.911
Mom. I'm hungry.

749
00:52:39.496 --> 00:52:41.332
Well then. go to the store.

750
00:52:41.332 --> 00:52:42.416
With what money?

751
00:52:42.416 --> 00:52:44.543
I gave you money earlier this week. Terry.

752
00:52:44.543 --> 00:52:46.253
Come on.

753
00:52:48.297 --> 00:52:51.425
Look. I only got ten dollars to my name.
I'm giving you five.

754
00:52:52.551 --> 00:52:53.552
Here.

755
00:52:58.557 --> 00:53:00.684
You thought any more about what she said?

756
00:53:00.684 --> 00:53:03.228
- Who said?
- Your teacher.

757
00:53:03.228 --> 00:53:05.481
Why does everything good mean
I got to go somewhere else?

758
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.650
Well...

759
00:53:10.444 --> 00:53:12.029
- You'll probably fit right in.

760
00:53:12.029 --> 00:53:15.282
As soft as you are. I'd rather that
than you chasing after Pea.

761
00:53:16.033 --> 00:53:17.785
Speaking of him.
I'm switching to the night shift

762
00:53:17.785 --> 00:53:19.578
so I can be here after school.

763
00:53:20.287 --> 00:53:22.247
Make sure you're not just running around.

764
00:53:22.247 --> 00:53:23.749
What's up with you and Luck?

765
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:26.585
Excuse me?

766
00:53:26.585 --> 00:53:28.337
Y'all not talking or something?

767
00:53:32.967 --> 00:53:35.469
Stop trying to change the subject.

768
00:53:38.138 --> 00:53:39.223
Listen.

769
00:53:40.307 --> 00:53:42.101
I'm not saying you gotta go.

770
00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:44.353
But at least think about it.

771
00:53:46.105 --> 00:53:48.023
I'll buy you a new pair of Jordans.

772
00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:52.569
In each portion.

773
00:53:52.569 --> 00:53:55.322
you will have approximately ten minutes
per section...

774
00:54:23.601 --> 00:54:26.186
You want me to pull up there
with you or something?

775
00:54:26.186 --> 00:54:27.771
'Cause you acting mad-pussy right now.

776
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:39.325
Anything else?

777
00:54:39.325 --> 00:54:41.160
Yeah. where can I call you?

778
00:54:42.536 --> 00:54:44.079
Simone. quit playing!

779
00:54:44.079 --> 00:54:47.499
- Aight. give me your name on AOL.
-"Unavailable222."

780
00:54:47.499 --> 00:54:48.959
Wow.
So I can't even get to know you?

781
00:54:48.959 --> 00:54:50.044
Yeah. get her. T.

782
00:54:50.044 --> 00:54:53.088
Listen. there's nothing else
I need to know about you

783
00:54:53.088 --> 00:54:55.966
or your little dirty-ass.
smelly-ass friend.

784
00:54:55.966 --> 00:54:58.677
Stop acting like
we ain't doing you a favor. Midnight.

785
00:54:58.677 --> 00:55:01.764
- Nappy-head ass.
Next customer.

786
00:55:07.895 --> 00:55:09.271
Knew you wasn't getting that.

787
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:11.315
I ain't tripping on her.

788
00:55:11.315 --> 00:55:13.233
'Cause I already tried four times.

789
00:55:13.233 --> 00:55:15.778
- Got to be a dyke!
- Shut the hell up. Pea.

790
00:55:15.778 --> 00:55:18.113
That's why I want one
of them Indian-looking girls.

791
00:55:18.113 --> 00:55:19.490
Shoot. they fire.

792
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:22.576
Let me see. Let me see it.

793
00:55:24.411 --> 00:55:25.412
Oh. my...

794
00:55:26.413 --> 00:55:27.915
You got into Tech?

795
00:55:28.582 --> 00:55:30.000
I don't see the big deal.

796
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.753
Thought all I had to do
was prove that I can get in.

797
00:55:33.712 --> 00:55:34.964
I changed my mind.

798
00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:36.840
Well. I didn't! I ain't going!

799
00:55:37.424 --> 00:55:40.803
Boy. you know how hard I'm busting my ass
to get you chances I never had?

800
00:55:42.388 --> 00:55:43.931
You make me feel like a damn fool.

801
00:55:43.931 --> 00:55:46.600
- Be a fool. then.
- Boy!

802
00:55:50.813 --> 00:55:53.816
I need you to talk some sense
into him. Please.

803
00:55:58.612 --> 00:56:00.531
Saying what. exactly?

804
00:56:00.531 --> 00:56:02.616
That he should go
to a better school.

805
00:56:04.743 --> 00:56:06.203
He doesn't want to be controlled.

806
00:56:06.203 --> 00:56:08.497
Who gives a fuck
about what he wants?

807
00:56:08.497 --> 00:56:09.957
What does he need?

808
00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:12.376
I don't know.

809
00:56:21.802 --> 00:56:23.387
Matter of fact. I do.

810
00:56:25.889 --> 00:56:27.182
It's you.

811
00:56:28.142 --> 00:56:29.602
Like how?

812
00:56:31.145 --> 00:56:32.646
You're too tough.

813
00:56:36.483 --> 00:56:38.402
Okay. What else?

814
00:56:38.402 --> 00:56:39.862
I'm listening.

815
00:56:43.449 --> 00:56:45.618
Maybe if you quiet down some...

816
00:56:48.203 --> 00:56:50.164
he would actually hear
what you have to say.

817
00:56:54.418 --> 00:56:55.586
Okay.

818
00:56:55.586 --> 00:56:58.672
I don't even remember
the last time I raised my voice.

819
00:56:59.506 --> 00:57:02.009
He'd do good at any school.

820
00:57:11.185 --> 00:57:13.646
You used to like when I got spicy.

821
00:57:17.149 --> 00:57:19.276
"Try and be quiet."

822
00:57:21.695 --> 00:57:24.073
"You should try and be quiet."

823
00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:25.324
Right?

824
00:57:26.867 --> 00:57:28.786
Quiet like when
you went missing for weeks.

825
00:57:28.786 --> 00:57:30.579
and I sat here and said nothing?

826
00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.791
- And never mind who you was with.
- See. there it go.

827
00:57:33.791 --> 00:57:37.002
If I get any more quieter.
I won't even have a fucking voice at all.

828
00:57:37.002 --> 00:57:38.754
I'm not about to sit here
and argue with you.

829
00:57:38.754 --> 00:57:41.882
That's real easy for you to say.
'cause you get to be the saint. right?

830
00:57:41.882 --> 00:57:43.133
You get to be the saint.

831
00:57:43.133 --> 00:57:45.177
while I'm stuck here
fighting these wars all by myself.

832
00:57:45.177 --> 00:57:47.263
- See how loud you're getting?
- What...

833
00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:49.890
- Well. then fucking show up for me. Lucky.
- Fuck this shit.

834
00:57:50.891 --> 00:57:52.393
Show up for me!

835
00:58:01.235 --> 00:58:03.862
I wonder what'd happen if I leave too.

836
00:58:19.169 --> 00:58:20.838
You scared.

837
00:58:23.882 --> 00:58:25.593
Something's gonna happen.

838
00:58:28.596 --> 00:58:30.806
I can feel it.

839
00:58:32.474 --> 00:58:34.101
- I can feel it.

840
00:58:34.101 --> 00:58:36.895
Did he tell you
he got stopped by the cops again?

841
00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.315
A few times.

842
00:58:40.899 --> 00:58:42.776
Then let him use his other name.

843
00:58:43.986 --> 00:58:46.780
- He doesn't have an--
- That's not the fucking point. Lucky!

844
00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.701
Shit. I don't know. aight?

845
00:58:50.701 --> 00:58:53.287
They's bound to come any-fucking-where.

846
00:59:14.808 --> 00:59:16.644
Take care of your moms. T!

847
00:59:17.811 --> 00:59:19.355
Where Luck going?

848
00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:21.857
And you-- I'ma say this one time.

849
00:59:21.857 --> 00:59:23.817
You look at me when I'm fucking talking.

850
00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:29.073
It's either you go to that school.
or you find somewhere else to live.

851
00:59:29.073 --> 00:59:30.157
You hear me?

852
01:00:07.903 --> 01:00:09.613
<i>...where to push
and where not to push.</i>

853
01:00:09.613 --> 01:00:12.241
<i>But I'ma take but so much.
and she gon' take but so much.</i>

854
01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:14.076
<i>so we compromise.</i>

855
01:00:14.076 --> 01:00:17.871
<i>It works out for you guys.
So. you gonna get married or...</i>

856
01:00:18.539 --> 01:00:20.958
<i>Uh--</i>
<i>All right. all right. all right.</i>

857
01:00:20.958 --> 01:00:22.126
<i>That's a whole 'nother show.</i>

858
01:00:22.126 --> 01:00:23.877
<i>I'm sorry. You had a comment. Yes?</i>

859
01:00:23.877 --> 01:00:25.838
<i>You say you do it for the attention.</i>

860
01:00:25.838 --> 01:00:27.298
<i>There are other ways of getting attention.</i>

861
01:00:27.298 --> 01:00:30.134
<i>Doesn't it cost you a lot of friendships
and relationships. being a bitch?</i>

862
01:00:30.134 --> 01:00:33.971
<i>Well. it has cost me a lot
of friendships and a lot of relationships.</i>

863
01:00:33.971 --> 01:00:36.599
<i>but I find in life that sometimes.</i>

864
01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:39.435
<i>having a friend in yourself
is better than having--</i>

865
01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:40.978
<i>worrying about having people
as your friends.</i>

866
01:00:40.978 --> 01:00:42.730
<i>'cause no one's
gonna look out for you but you.</i>

867
01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:44.481
-<i>and I've learned that in life.</i>

868
01:00:44.481 --> 01:00:47.067
<i>I've looked out for people.
you know. but--</i>

869
01:00:47.901 --> 01:00:49.987
<i>You seem to make some sense.</i>

870
01:00:49.987 --> 01:00:53.115
<i>I mean. I'm saying.
I have friends now.</i>

871
01:00:53.115 --> 01:00:55.993
-<i>They're bitchy like me. so we get along.</i>

872
01:00:55.993 --> 01:00:58.454
<i>We-- I'm serious.
We understand each other.</i>

873
01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:00.789
-<i>And. like. I'm generous...</i>
<i>They got a little dog pound.</i>

874
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:03.834
<i>Right. And I help--
I help out some of my family members.</i>

875
01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:05.294
<i>as well as they help me.</i>

876
01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:08.380
<i>But they also know
where to push my buttons</i>

877
01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:10.841
<i>and where to go also. as Paul said.</i>

878
01:01:10.841 --> 01:01:11.926
<i>Okay. yes?</i>

879
01:01:11.926 --> 01:01:13.844
<i>I know I like to get what I want.</i>

880
01:01:13.844 --> 01:01:15.512
<i>but I think there are other ways
to do that--</i>

881
01:01:15.512 --> 01:01:17.181
<i>That only makes people...</i>

882
01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:38.577
- Come shoot some hoops with me.

883
01:01:38.577 --> 01:01:40.037
I'm about to go to the store.

884
01:01:40.788 --> 01:01:41.956
Come here.

885
01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:49.713
You need some money?

886
01:01:49.713 --> 01:01:51.507
- Ma gave me some.
- Here.

887
01:01:53.634 --> 01:01:54.802
Take it anyway.

888
01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:58.430
A man should always have some money
in his pocket.

889
01:02:01.433 --> 01:02:03.769
So. um. where you been at?

890
01:02:15.155 --> 01:02:16.782
I needed some time to clear my head.

891
01:02:24.415 --> 01:02:26.959
Feels like it's been a lot longer
than that this time.

892
01:02:27.835 --> 01:02:29.503
Y'all breaking up or something?

893
01:02:33.215 --> 01:02:34.550
Want to shoot?

894
01:02:47.354 --> 01:02:49.106
Your mother ever tell you how we met?

895
01:02:54.028 --> 01:02:55.070
No.

896
01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:58.866
She used to work at this coffee shop
that closed down a few years ago.

897
01:02:59.658 --> 01:03:01.952
I used to get my hair cut
right across the street.

898
01:03:01.952 --> 01:03:04.246
I'd go in.
I'd order me a bagel or whatever.

899
01:03:04.246 --> 01:03:06.999
But I'm still not sure
how I'ma kick it to her.

900
01:03:07.875 --> 01:03:09.710
And ended up telling her the truth.

901
01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:14.715
That she was the most beautiful woman...

902
01:03:17.217 --> 01:03:18.677
that I ever seen.

903
01:03:23.057 --> 01:03:24.516
Were you nervous?

904
01:03:28.687 --> 01:03:30.564
I just felt like she should know.

905
01:03:33.067 --> 01:03:35.069
But something told me to go back. right?

906
01:03:36.528 --> 01:03:38.697
This is when I had my other bike.

907
01:03:38.697 --> 01:03:43.243
A few days later.
I said. "Let me take you for a ride."

908
01:03:44.161 --> 01:03:46.080
We been rocking ever since.

909
01:03:56.924 --> 01:03:58.092
T...

910
01:04:01.595 --> 01:04:04.306
don't get caught up in none of this shit
that you see around here.

911
01:04:04.306 --> 01:04:05.516
Have I ever?

912
01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.895
Took me too long to learn that.

913
01:04:10.562 --> 01:04:14.108
I don't want to see you fall into
the same traps as me and your mother.

914
01:04:18.112 --> 01:04:20.114
I want you
to make better choices than me.

915
01:04:20.948 --> 01:04:22.741
When it comes to her.

916
01:04:23.284 --> 01:04:24.827
When it comes to everything.

917
01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:32.209
I. uh...

918
01:04:34.211 --> 01:04:36.422
I got into the specialized high school.

919
01:04:37.464 --> 01:04:39.133
Oh. yeah?

920
01:04:40.259 --> 01:04:42.553
- So what you gon' do?
- I don't know.

921
01:04:43.596 --> 01:04:45.055
What you think?

922
01:04:45.055 --> 01:04:46.473
It's not up to me. T.

923
01:04:49.101 --> 01:04:50.603
You getting older now.

924
01:04:52.313 --> 01:04:54.565
Time for you
to start thinking for yourself.

925
01:05:21.342 --> 01:05:22.635
What?

926
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:29.725
I love you.

927
01:05:31.226 --> 01:05:33.228
You hear me?

928
01:05:33.228 --> 01:05:34.313
Yeah.

929
01:05:37.358 --> 01:05:38.525
Check up.

930
01:05:45.699 --> 01:05:47.034
Oh. got it.

931
01:05:50.496 --> 01:05:52.206
Psst. psst.

932
01:05:52.206 --> 01:05:53.832
Ayo. ma!

933
01:05:55.626 --> 01:05:57.336
What are you doing here?

934
01:05:57.336 --> 01:05:59.421
I can't walk with my lady?

935
01:06:14.228 --> 01:06:17.231
- How was work?
- Good.

936
01:06:17.231 --> 01:06:20.276
Good morning.

937
01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:22.528
Yo. you remember what it's like
when we were coming up?

938
01:06:22.528 --> 01:06:23.612
I remember.

939
01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:26.782
You should be proud of yourself. Inez.

940
01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.076
We made it.

941
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:38.043
You don't seem happy.

942
01:06:42.673 --> 01:06:44.425
Think Terry resents me?

943
01:06:47.678 --> 01:06:49.179
Teenagers hate everybody.

944
01:06:49.179 --> 01:06:51.348
But I do sense a little void in him.

945
01:06:52.266 --> 01:06:55.019
First couple years of his life.
he ain't had nobody.

946
01:06:55.019 --> 01:06:57.896
Kid's still walking around here
with a broken heart.

947
01:07:00.691 --> 01:07:03.027
Maybe it's time for y'all
to have that conversation.

948
01:07:04.278 --> 01:07:07.072
Give him some of the answers
that he been looking for.

949
01:07:09.116 --> 01:07:11.452
Yeah. I'll know when the time's right.

950
01:07:15.873 --> 01:07:16.957
Um...

951
01:07:18.292 --> 01:07:20.210
I was thinking.
when Terry goes off to school.

952
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:23.213
maybe I'll get to doing hair again.

953
01:07:23.213 --> 01:07:25.049
Maybe open up a shop.

954
01:07:28.802 --> 01:07:30.304
Can't wait.

955
01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:42.316
<i>Thank you.</i>

956
01:07:43.651 --> 01:07:47.279

959
01:07:53.077 --> 01:07:56.038
<i>"New York is the last true city."</i>

960
01:07:56.038 --> 01:08:01.085
<i>And it is the vitality
of our neighborhoods that define us.</i>

961
01:08:01.085 --> 01:08:02.711
<i>In the next four years.</i>

962
01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:06.257
<i>I will devote myself
to building a better New York--</i>

963
01:08:06.257 --> 01:08:07.508

Let me hear that one.

01:08:42.793 --> 01:08:45.129
It's mad old. though.

973
01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:47.464
Old?

974
01:08:47.464 --> 01:08:49.300
The fuck is The Delfonics. B?

975
01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.134
Why don't you pass me

976

What does it say?

978
01:09:03.856 --> 01:09:05.441
The sample.

979
01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:08.819
Wasn't too old for the Fugees.

980
01:09:10.821 --> 01:09:13.782
Yo. come on.

981
01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:15.492

T.

987
01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:34.428
Hey. I want you to hang on to that.

988
01:09:37.598 --> 01:09:41.059
That way. you can take your time
flipping through everything.

989
01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.442
So. which college you decided on?

990
01:09:50.902 --> 01:09:51.904
I don't know yet.

991
01:09:51.904 --> 01:09:53.864
You should be more excited.

992
01:09:55.908 --> 01:09:57.076
Nah.

Well. go somewhere far.

You know. my era.

997
01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:10.297
Yeah.

998
01:10:10.923 --> 01:10:12.258
Maybe.

999
01:10:13.008 --> 01:10:15.636
Go on and show off
that legacy of Harlem.

1000
01:10:24.311 --> 01:10:26.480
Hi. I'm Jerry.

1001
01:10:27.481 --> 01:10:29.483
Uh. I'm your new landlord.

1002
01:10:31.902 --> 01:10:35.239
The lady across the hall said
that your husband has cancer.

1003
01:10:35.239 --> 01:10:36.490
Really sorry to hear that.

1004
01:10:37.449 --> 01:10:38.867
It's all right.

1005
01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:41.412
So you own those buildings
across the street too?

1006
01:10:41.412 --> 01:10:42.997
Yeah. Yeah.

1007
01:10:43.956 --> 01:10:46.417
Everything working okay?

1008
01:10:46.417 --> 01:10:49.878
Heat coming up?
Hot water? All that?

1009
01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:51.839
I actually just realized that. um.

1010
01:10:51.839 --> 01:10:54.592
I got a few loose tiles
around my shower area.

1011
01:10:54.592 --> 01:10:56.969
Oh! Yeah. Let's go look at it.

1012
01:10:57.678 --> 01:10:58.846
Uh-oh.

1013
01:11:00.848 --> 01:11:02.016
Something happen here?

1014
01:11:02.975 --> 01:11:04.435
Yeah.

1015
01:11:04.435 --> 01:11:08.147
We tried to fix it a few times.
but it keeps falling off.

1016
01:11:09.857 --> 01:11:11.984
- I can fix this for you.
- Really?

1017
01:11:11.984 --> 01:11:14.320
Yeah.
This is no problem at all.

1018
01:11:15.529 --> 01:11:16.947
Um...

1019
01:11:16.947 --> 01:11:18.198
Wow.

1020
01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:20.534
Maybe some new cabinets. too.

1021
01:11:20.534 --> 01:11:23.537
because these have to be
at least 20 years old.

1022
01:11:24.163 --> 01:11:26.582
- Have you met Javier?
- Who?

1023
01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:29.126
- Uh. the new super.

1024
01:11:29.126 --> 01:11:32.296
Okay. let me see

Manna's. Simone speaking.

01:14:09.662 --> 01:14:11.288
Oh. uh...

1058
01:14:11.288 --> 01:14:13.123
Si-- Simone?

1059
01:14:13.123 --> 01:14:14.208
<i>Yes?</i>

1060
01:14:15.334 --> 01:14:16.585
Oh. um...

1061
01:14:17.461 --> 01:14:18.545
Yeah. I just. um--

1062
01:14:20.214 --> 01:14:23.717
Yeah. I-- I just wanted to let you know
I think you're the most. uh...

1063
01:14:26.262 --> 01:14:30.641
well. you're the most. uh. beautiful girl.
you know. or whatever. you know.

1064
01:14:30.641 --> 01:14:32.142
I was just trying to see if you...

1065
01:14:32.142 --> 01:14:34.728
Would you please
stop fucking calling here? I'm working.

1066
01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.276
Well. call me tonight. then.

1067
01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:44.863
Fine.

1068
01:14:52.204 --> 01:14:53.747
To stay or to go?

1069
01:14:54.415 --> 01:14:57.751
Look. The whole sink is gone.
Look at the hole by the shower.

1070
01:14:58.544 --> 01:15:00.754
It wasn't so big at first.

1071
01:15:00.754 --> 01:15:03.841
but more fell down this morning.

1072
01:15:03.841 --> 01:15:05.509
All we got left is the kitchen sink.

1073
01:15:05.509 --> 01:15:09.305
Yeah. I know. I know. I know.

1074
01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:13.309
- Let me show you the kitchen.
- No. no. I already saw it.

1075
01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:14.727
Um...

1076
01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:20.107
Inez. this--
this is my... this is my mistake.

1077
01:15:20.107 --> 01:15:23.277
The guys.
they thought this was a full flip.

1078
01:15:23.277 --> 01:15:24.528
like some of the other units.

1079
01:15:24.528 --> 01:15:27.489
so I'm happy to have them
come back in and finish up.

1080
01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.450
and I won't charge you anything or...

1081
01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:31.535
Okay. yeah. just let me know the day.

1082
01:15:31.535 --> 01:15:34.538
I can stay home from work or Terry
could be here. if it's after school.

1083
01:15:34.538 --> 01:15:38.250
Well. we'd actually need you to--
uh. to clear out of the apartment.

1084
01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:40.210
'Cause there's--
there's just too much damage.

1085
01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:42.379
I mean. everything's got to get lifted--

1086
01:15:42.379 --> 01:15:43.464
Like how long?

1087
01:15:43.464 --> 01:15:46.133
I mean. as long as it--
you know. until it's done.

1088
01:15:46.133 --> 01:15:47.384
A couple months.

1089
01:15:47.384 --> 01:15:49.219
What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

1090
01:15:49.219 --> 01:15:50.971
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

1091
01:15:50.971 --> 01:15:52.640
Like two adults. okay?

1092
01:15:53.349 --> 01:15:55.225
There's no reason here to get loud.

1093
01:15:57.978 --> 01:16:01.565
We have no bathroom.
no shower. Jerry.

1094
01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:05.945
- We have no stove. Jerry.

1095
01:16:05.945 --> 01:16:09.531
Is-- There's not. like. a family member
or a friend you could stay with?

1096
01:16:10.449 --> 01:16:12.576
Look. this building is too old.

1097
01:16:12.576 --> 01:16:14.244
I come in and fix something.

1098
01:16:14.244 --> 01:16:17.206
I got to come back a couple months later
and do it again.

1099
01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:20.250
You know. this way. we come in here.

1100
01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:22.419
we replace everything all at once.

1101
01:16:22.419 --> 01:16:24.797
There's got to be another option.

1102
01:16:24.797 --> 01:16:26.507
Or you could leave.

1103
01:16:31.971 --> 01:16:33.555
My hands are tied.

1104
01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:35.975
Give me a call.
Let me know what you decide.

1105
01:16:41.855 --> 01:16:44.233

1119
01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:21.854
Can you walk
on the other side of me?

1120
01:17:22.563 --> 01:17:23.814
Hmm?

1121
01:17:23.814 --> 01:17:25.899
It's for your protection.

1122
01:17:29.069 --> 01:17:30.070
Come on.

1123
01:17:45.252 --> 01:17:47.254
Think you put enough?

1124
01:17:47.254 --> 01:17:49.089
You know you want one.

1125
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:50.674
Mmm.

1126
01:17:50.674 --> 01:17:53.302
Why you always acting all stank
whenever we come around?

1127
01:17:53.302 --> 01:17:57.306
That's not a act. Your friends
are dumb as fuck. especially Pea.

1128
01:17:57.306 --> 01:17:59.725
"What you gonna do about that kitchen?"

1129
01:17:59.725 --> 01:18:02.269
"Damn. when you gonna eat
some more meals?"

1130
01:18:02.269 --> 01:18:05.481
-"Wow! What up. Midnight?"

1131
01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:07.274
Aight. aight. I get it. I get it.

1132
01:18:08.776 --> 01:18:10.861
I'm sorry. I know those are your friends.

1133
01:18:10.861 --> 01:18:12.112
Is that how you act too?

1134
01:18:17.034 --> 01:18:18.619
You see me here. right?

1135
01:18:19.662 --> 01:18:22.414
I'm not here for anybody
trying to make me hate myself.

1136
01:18:26.126 --> 01:18:29.088
So how'd you miss a year of school
and still end up at Tech?

1137
01:18:29.088 --> 01:18:30.172
You like it?

1138
01:18:32.508 --> 01:18:33.509
It's okay.

1139
01:18:33.509 --> 01:18:36.470
Okay? And? What else?
What don't you like about it?

1140
01:18:37.054 --> 01:18:41.517
I don't know. Just don't.

1141
01:18:42.977 --> 01:18:45.145
There's nothing wrong
with being smart. you know.

1142
01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:47.648
We could use a few more engineers
around here.

1143
01:18:47.648 --> 01:18:49.483
I just don't care
about none of that. though.

1144
01:18:49.483 --> 01:18:51.485
Okay. So. what you want to do?

1145
01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:53.654
Oh.

1146
01:18:53.654 --> 01:18:57.116
I mean. I like a lot of things. you know. Uh...

1147
01:18:58.659 --> 01:19:01.078
Right now. I'm-- I'm into music.

1148
01:19:01.829 --> 01:19:02.997
You want to rap?

1149
01:19:02.997 --> 01:19:04.623
Nah. Like...

1150
01:19:06.458 --> 01:19:07.459
Like. uh...

1151
01:19:09.670 --> 01:19:11.088
You ever seen <i>The Wiz</i>?

1152
01:19:11.755 --> 01:19:12.590
Yeah.

1153
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:14.633
Yeah. like. stuff like that.

1154
01:19:16.468 --> 01:19:18.596
This Black dude. uh. Quincy Jones.

1155
01:19:18.596 --> 01:19:22.600
he. uh. did the whole score
for the movie. you know.

1156
01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.435
Did some other movies too.

1157
01:19:24.435 --> 01:19:27.938
Like a composer.

1158
01:19:27.938 --> 01:19:30.274
Yeah. Yeah.

1159
01:19:32.359 --> 01:19:34.111
PS. I know who Quincy Jones is.

1160
01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:36.864
You should be in some art school.

1161
01:19:37.781 --> 01:19:39.283
You could go to Juilliard.

1162
01:19:39.283 --> 01:19:41.160
I can help you figure out what it takes.

1163
01:19:42.369 --> 01:19:43.370
No.

1164
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:46.206
Kids trying to get in there
have been training for years.

1165
01:19:46.206 --> 01:19:47.791
Well. where'd Quincy Jones go?

1166
01:19:51.545 --> 01:19:52.880
He didn't go to school.

1167
01:20:13.233 --> 01:20:14.568
I want to see you again.

1168
01:20:17.905 --> 01:20:19.740
I should be honest with you. Um...

1169
01:20:21.075 --> 01:20:23.118
I'm moving in a couple weeks.

1170
01:20:23.744 --> 01:20:25.245
To my uncle's in Florida.

1171
01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:29.416
This white guy
was trying to help us save the house.

1172
01:20:29.416 --> 01:20:31.168
but took the deed or something.

1173
01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:35.172
But we can keep in touch. though.

1174
01:20:36.757 --> 01:20:38.259
I'm gonna miss Harlem.

1175
01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:43.138
<i>What's her name?</i>

1176
01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:44.932
I don't know what you talking 'bout.

1177
01:20:46.016 --> 01:20:48.269
So who's the girl
I saw you hanging out with?

1178
01:20:48.269 --> 01:20:49.770
Just a girl. Ma.

1179
01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:51.397
Well. is she your girlfriend?

1180
01:20:51.397 --> 01:20:56.110
Come on.
You know I like Spanish girls. Ma.

1181
01:20:57.319 --> 01:20:58.320
Pardon me?

1182
01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:02.074
What. she look too much like you
for you to take seriously?

1183
01:21:04.243 --> 01:21:05.369
You know what. little boy?

1184
01:21:05.369 --> 01:21:08.622
I love you. I really do.

1185
01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.542
But I'm starting not to like you anymore.

1186
01:21:29.059 --> 01:21:30.853
Now. what's this all about?

1187
01:21:30.853 --> 01:21:33.564
Showing up late. not handing in your work.

1188
01:21:33.564 --> 01:21:35.024
Something's on your mind.

1189
01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:39.403
I said I'm fine.

1190
01:21:39.403 --> 01:21:41.947
What's going on with college?
You make a decision yet?

1191
01:21:45.492 --> 01:21:46.493
Daryl?

1192
01:21:50.831 --> 01:21:52.875
- Not yet.
- And why's that?

1193
01:21:52.875 --> 01:21:54.668
You discuss it with your mother?

1194
01:21:56.545 --> 01:21:57.588
Yeah.

1195
01:21:58.631 --> 01:21:59.632
A little.

1196
01:22:04.345 --> 01:22:06.597
You know this is a safe place.

1197
01:22:12.686 --> 01:22:15.189
How have things been at home
since your father got worse?

1198
01:22:19.276 --> 01:22:23.322
They. uh... They don't think
he's gonna come home.

1199
01:22:26.867 --> 01:22:28.535
I'm sorry to hear that.

1200
01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:37.378
I think the landlord's trying
to push us out or something.

1201
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:45.886
Do you wanna come work
with me at CCA?

1202
01:22:47.554 --> 01:22:49.223
I run the after-school program.

1203
01:22:50.891 --> 01:22:52.559
Part-time. a few hours.

1204
01:22:54.895 --> 01:22:56.188
How much it pay?

1205
01:22:56.188 --> 01:22:57.773
Enough to help.

1206
01:22:58.983 --> 01:23:02.319
You do good. we'll work
on something better this summer.

1207
01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:06.115
I don't need working papers from you
since you're turning 18 soon.

1208
01:23:06.115 --> 01:23:09.285
Just ask your mother for
your birth certificate and Social. okay?

1209
01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:20.462
Um...

1210
01:23:21.213 --> 01:23:23.257
Thank you. Ms. Tucker.

1211
01:23:23.257 --> 01:23:25.009
I'm happy to help.

1212
01:23:30.264 --> 01:23:31.265
Yo. Ma!

1213
01:24:26.987 --> 01:24:29.365
Hey. hey. hey. Hey. hey.

1214
01:24:30.074 --> 01:24:31.241
Okay. breathe.

1215
01:24:34.411 --> 01:24:35.955
Okay. okay. Okay.

1216
01:24:38.165 --> 01:24:40.167
Maybe you should try
and eat some food.

1217
01:24:41.877 --> 01:24:42.920
Yeah?

1218
01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.713
- I'm not hungry.
- Okay.

1219
01:24:56.767 --> 01:24:58.185
Why do you love me?

1220
01:25:00.145 --> 01:25:02.231
The same reason everybody does.

1221
01:25:05.526 --> 01:25:06.986
That's not an answer.

1222
01:25:10.823 --> 01:25:12.283
I wanna know why.

1223
01:25:13.993 --> 01:25:15.202
You should. um...

1224
01:25:16.537 --> 01:25:19.123
You should probably stop talking
and get some rest. okay?

1225
01:25:27.214 --> 01:25:29.717
I never really knew where it came from.

1226
01:25:34.847 --> 01:25:36.140
Or whether or not...

1227
01:25:42.271 --> 01:25:44.189
whether or not I deserved it.

1228
01:25:48.736 --> 01:25:50.571
Maybe that's why I never...

1229
01:25:53.741 --> 01:25:55.868
I never fully gave it back.

1230
01:25:58.746 --> 01:26:00.039
Now I wonder...

1231
01:26:02.625 --> 01:26:04.418
I wonder if it's too late.

1232
01:26:07.755 --> 01:26:10.174
Damaged people
don't know how to love each other.

1233
01:26:11.842 --> 01:26:12.843
That's all.

1234
01:26:54.218 --> 01:26:55.386
T. sit down.

1235
01:26:56.804 --> 01:26:59.014
I need to talk to you
about a few things.

1236
01:27:13.654 --> 01:27:14.947
Um...

1237
01:27:16.282 --> 01:27:19.285
Before Lucky got sick. we wanted to
have a conversation with you about...

1238
01:27:19.285 --> 01:27:20.911
I don't wanna talk to you about Lucky.

1239
01:27:20.911 --> 01:27:22.037
It's not about him.

1240
01:27:22.037 --> 01:27:24.456
Yo. I don't wanna talk to you
about anything!

1241
01:27:25.958 --> 01:27:26.959
Yeah?

1242
01:27:28.085 --> 01:27:31.839
Only thing I ever wanted more
than a mother was a fucking father!

1243
01:27:38.304 --> 01:27:39.388
Maybe...

1244
01:27:41.849 --> 01:27:44.268
Maybe if you--
if you weren't so hard on him.

1245
01:27:44.268 --> 01:27:45.936
walking around here
so miserable all the time.

1246
01:27:45.936 --> 01:27:47.688
he'd still fucking be here!

1247
01:27:50.608 --> 01:27:51.734
Hmm.

1248
01:28:00.367 --> 01:28:01.660
You don't mean that.

01:28:23.766 --> 01:28:27.269

1256

Yo. Ma.

1257
01:28:50.334 --> 01:28:52.544
- Ma.
- What?

1258
01:28:53.462 --> 01:28:56.340
This lady over there.
she keep looking over here.

1259
01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:57.508
Who is that?

1260
01:29:00.803 --> 01:29:03.055
That's Lucky's daughter
and her mother.

1261
01:29:05.891 --> 01:29:07.434
Make 'em a plate.

1262
01:29:08.769 --> 01:29:09.770
She's what?

1263
01:29:11.105 --> 01:29:12.439
We'll talk about it later.

1264
01:29:49.184 --> 01:29:50.269
Fuck!

1265
01:29:53.314 --> 01:29:55.524
- Terry!
- Ma. what happened?

1266
01:29:55.524 --> 01:29:56.900
Come move this stuff!

1267
01:29:58.235 --> 01:30:00.112
One of the pipes!

1268
01:30:00.112 --> 01:30:01.196
I-- I got it!

1269
01:30:01.989 --> 01:30:04.033
Ma! Yo.

1270
01:30:04.033 --> 01:30:05.326
Come on. come on.

1271
01:30:21.842 --> 01:30:22.843
Sweetheart.

1272
01:30:25.512 --> 01:30:27.014
You seen Javier?

1273
01:30:27.014 --> 01:30:29.224
- Who?
- The super.

1274
01:30:29.224 --> 01:30:31.435
Oh. um. not since yesterday.

1275
01:30:32.186 --> 01:30:33.187
Sorry.

1276
01:30:44.198 --> 01:30:46.075
Daryl. we need to talk.

1277
01:30:46.075 --> 01:30:47.701
Your paperwork was denied.

1278
01:30:49.119 --> 01:30:50.287
What?

1279
01:30:50.287 --> 01:30:53.290
The Social Security number
you gave me isn't valid.

1280
01:30:53.290 --> 01:30:55.459
I'm glad I caught it
before somebody else did.

1281
01:30:55.459 --> 01:30:58.671
Yeah-- I-- I forgot. It-- It expired.

1282
01:30:59.463 --> 01:31:01.048
That's not how it works.

1283
01:31:01.882 --> 01:31:06.136
So. then wh--
That mean. like. I don't get the job or...

1284
01:31:06.136 --> 01:31:08.305
Well. before I can even look
into any of that.

1285
01:31:08.305 --> 01:31:11.600
we need to sort out
how you ended up with phony papers.

1286
01:31:12.184 --> 01:31:13.811
Did you really ask your mom?

1287
01:31:17.231 --> 01:31:19.316
She don't-- She don't have 'em.

1288
01:31:20.567 --> 01:31:21.860
You're from here. right?

1289
01:31:23.237 --> 01:31:25.739
- What you mean?
- Born in the States.

1290
01:31:26.782 --> 01:31:29.952
Yea-- Yeah. Nah. yeah. yeah.

1291
01:31:30.744 --> 01:31:34.123
Well...
...this could mean a lot of hell for you.

1292
01:31:34.123 --> 01:31:36.292
To get a job. to do anything.

1293
01:31:36.292 --> 01:31:39.461
I mean. it's still probably. you know.
like. with the city.

1294
01:31:40.254 --> 01:31:42.590
From when I was in foster care.

1295
01:31:45.009 --> 01:31:46.093
Huh.

1296
01:31:50.139 --> 01:31:52.975
Oh. I have a friend
down in Social Services who can help.

1297
01:31:52.975 --> 01:31:55.019
No. no. it's cool. it's cool. it's cool.

1298
01:31:55.019 --> 01:31:57.021
It's all good. It's all good.
We just-- It's all good.

1299
01:31:57.021 --> 01:31:58.856
Hey. Janice.

1300
01:31:59.773 --> 01:32:02.318
Listen. I need a favor.
I have a student here whose paperwork is...

1301
01:32:02.318 --> 01:32:04.945
Hey. no. no.
Hey. yo. yo. Ms. Tucker. come on!

1302
01:32:07.781 --> 01:32:09.408
It's all-- It's all good.

1303
01:32:12.286 --> 01:32:13.454
Um...

1304
01:32:15.414 --> 01:32:18.208
They-- They don't--
They don't know I'm with my mother.

1305
01:32:18.208 --> 01:32:19.501
- You know?
- And why is that?

1306
01:32:19.501 --> 01:32:21.170
Who are you supposed to be with?

1307
01:32:22.671 --> 01:32:25.049
- Um...
- Have you told anyone else about this?

1308
01:32:27.134 --> 01:32:29.803
- Nah.
- Is Daryl your real name?

1309
01:32:31.972 --> 01:32:34.642
If you lied on your college applications.
it's a felony.

1310
01:32:34.642 --> 01:32:35.893
It's Terry!

1311
01:32:43.484 --> 01:32:45.778
It's-- It's Terry Wallace.

1312
01:32:50.824 --> 01:32:52.534
How long ago did this happen?

1313
01:32:56.455 --> 01:32:58.123
When-- When I was little.

1314
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.961
I was a social worker for years.

1315
01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:06.382
If the city didn't want to give you back.
it's likely because something happened.

1316
01:33:06.382 --> 01:33:09.551
Regardless of what.
you are still a ward of the state.

1317
01:33:09.551 --> 01:33:11.428
By law. I have to report this.

1318
01:33:11.428 --> 01:33:14.265
No. Do any of that even matter. though?

1319
01:33:14.265 --> 01:33:16.892
You know. I'm finna be 18
in a few weeks. you know. so...

1320
01:33:16.892 --> 01:33:18.143
I can't keep this to myself.

1321
01:33:19.144 --> 01:33:20.729
I have to speak with your mother.

1322
01:33:33.409 --> 01:33:36.370
- Can I talk to you?
- It'd be nicer if you could help.

1323
01:33:37.663 --> 01:33:39.873
- What happened?
- What does it look like. Terry?

1324
01:33:40.833 --> 01:33:43.002
Called the super ten times
since yesterday.

1325
01:33:44.378 --> 01:33:45.921
It's about the job with Ms. Tucker.

1326
01:33:45.921 --> 01:33:49.758
She. um-- She want
my birth certificate and my Social.

1327
01:33:49.758 --> 01:33:51.594
The real ones.

1328
01:33:51.594 --> 01:33:53.053
What do you mean. the real one?

1329
01:33:53.053 --> 01:33:55.264
The papers I found in your room.
they didn't work--

1330
01:33:55.264 --> 01:33:57.558
What do you mean. the papers you found
in my room? You went through my stuff?

1331
01:33:57.558 --> 01:33:59.893
- Why wouldn't you ask me?
- I didn't know I had to!

1332
01:34:01.687 --> 01:34:05.024
She want to come by tomorrow evening
and talk to you.

1333
01:34:05.024 --> 01:34:06.108
For what?

1334
01:34:06.108 --> 01:34:08.944
Well. I mean. I don't know.
What was I supposed to say?

1335
01:34:16.035 --> 01:34:18.412
I don't know how the hell
we gonna get ahold of those.

1336
01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:25.878
Come with me outside. I...

1337
01:34:27.379 --> 01:34:28.505
I need to smoke.

1338
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:31.508
Starting to smell in here.

1339
01:34:44.772 --> 01:34:46.148
You wanted to leave me.

1340
01:34:49.068 --> 01:34:50.069
No.

1341
01:34:51.695 --> 01:34:52.780
No. Ma.

1342
01:34:53.697 --> 01:34:55.449
Why would you say something like that?

1343
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:58.911
Forget it.

1344
01:35:03.832 --> 01:35:05.960
What time
your teacher coming tomorrow?

1345
01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:08.963
- Around 6:00 or something. I think.

1346
01:35:17.137 --> 01:35:18.180
T. you should probably see

1347
01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:21.767
if you can stay with Pea
and Miss Annie a little while.

1348
01:35:21.767 --> 01:35:24.061
till they finish working on the apartment.

1349
01:35:29.316 --> 01:35:30.526
Where you gonna go?

1350
01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.321
I'll figure it out.

1351
01:35:37.157 --> 01:35:38.993
I'll go to your school tomorrow

1352
01:35:39.618 --> 01:35:43.330
and get everything straightened out
with Ms. What's-Her-Face.

1353
01:36:02.474 --> 01:36:03.559
Yo. Ma.

1354
01:36:14.695 --> 01:36:17.031
Yo. hey. Titi. What's up?

1355
01:36:17.865 --> 01:36:19.408
Um...

1356
01:36:19.408 --> 01:36:21.952
Yeah. you-- you heard from my mother yet?

1357
01:36:24.913 --> 01:36:29.710
Nah. I been--
I been trying to call her all morning.

1358
01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:31.253
No. she. um...

1359
01:36:32.338 --> 01:36:33.505
Yeah. just. um...

1360
01:36:35.674 --> 01:36:38.385
Yeah. just give me a call back
when you-- when you do.

1361
01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:47.937
Hey. y-yeah.

1362
01:36:47.937 --> 01:36:50.189
Yeah. Aunt Kim. Hold on. Let me...

1363
01:36:51.023 --> 01:36:53.150
Hey. no. let. uh--
let me give you a call back.

1364
01:36:57.696 --> 01:37:00.616
Hi. Terrance. Is your mother home?

1365
01:37:01.408 --> 01:37:02.534
Um...

1366
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:04.578
N-- No.

1367
01:37:05.496 --> 01:37:06.872
She left for work already?

1368
01:37:08.248 --> 01:37:11.418
Yeah. um. I think so.

1369
01:37:14.338 --> 01:37:17.216
Do you mind if we come in
and talk for a bit?

1370
01:37:18.133 --> 01:37:19.176
Uh...

1371
01:37:20.094 --> 01:37:22.596
Yeah. I mean. yeah. yeah. yeah. Okay.

1372
01:37:23.222 --> 01:37:24.556
Thank you.

1373
01:37:25.432 --> 01:37:27.643
- This is Anne.
- Hey.

1374
01:37:27.643 --> 01:37:31.063
And this is Officer Philips.
Officer Russo.

1375
01:37:31.939 --> 01:37:33.190
May we have a seat?

1376
01:37:34.650 --> 01:37:36.568
How long ago did she leave?

1377
01:37:38.529 --> 01:37:39.780
Yesterday evening.

1378
01:37:40.406 --> 01:37:42.866
What was the last thing
she said to you?

1379
01:37:42.866 --> 01:37:45.202
Did she say anything
out of the ordinary?

1380
01:37:45.202 --> 01:37:47.121
Anything unusual?

1381
01:37:47.621 --> 01:37:51.292
Well... not that I remember.

1382
01:37:52.126 --> 01:37:53.877
Everything seemed fine.

1383
01:37:53.877 --> 01:37:55.337
Excuse me. sir. could you--
could you--

1384
01:37:55.337 --> 01:37:58.215
could y'all. you know.
not go through all our stuff?

1385
01:37:58.215 --> 01:38:00.884
Terrance. we really need
your cooperation on this.

1386
01:38:00.884 --> 01:38:03.220
Uh. she. like. gonna get in trouble
or something?

1387
01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:06.223
You know. 'cause. I mean.
you know. why does it even matter?

1388
01:38:06.223 --> 01:38:08.809
I mean. you know.
I'm almost 18. you know. so.

1389
01:38:10.477 --> 01:38:11.687
Um...

1390
01:38:12.438 --> 01:38:13.606
Well. about that.

1391
01:38:15.441 --> 01:38:18.819
It's difficult for me to say
what I have to say right now.

1392
01:38:21.989 --> 01:38:22.990
Inez...

1393
01:38:24.450 --> 01:38:26.160
is not your biological mother.

1394
01:38:30.748 --> 01:38:31.790
N--

1395
01:38:32.666 --> 01:38:34.501
Like some joke or something?

1396
01:38:34.501 --> 01:38:35.836
No. it's not.

1397
01:38:43.093 --> 01:38:45.054
This is the woman who abducted you.

1398
01:38:47.932 --> 01:38:51.018
Whatever story she told you
was just a lie that she cooked up.

1399
01:38:53.187 --> 01:38:55.898
I am so sorry
you have to find out like this.

1400
01:38:55.898 --> 01:38:58.108
Are you sure
you don't know where she is?

1401
01:38:58.108 --> 01:38:59.360
Any ideas at all?

1402
01:39:01.278 --> 01:39:02.905
Give him some room. please.

1403
01:39:05.032 --> 01:39:09.119
For now. we need to focus on
what's best for Terry moving forward.

1404
01:39:09.119 --> 01:39:10.788
What's best for me?

1405
01:39:10.788 --> 01:39:13.332
He doesn't have any known relatives
that we can trust.

1406
01:39:13.332 --> 01:39:14.959
That's all right.

1407
01:39:14.959 --> 01:39:17.503
We can place him at Sheltering Arms
for the time being.

1408
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:20.798
It's a family services program. It's...

1409
01:39:20.798 --> 01:39:22.091
I know what it is.

1410
01:39:22.091 --> 01:39:25.928
Just for a couple of weeks.
until we can navigate next steps.

1411
01:39:29.682 --> 01:39:31.433
If that's all right with you.

1412
01:39:33.477 --> 01:39:35.980
I don't know if your parents
are still on the street.

1413
01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:37.731
but we can work on that.

1414
01:39:39.650 --> 01:39:41.610
Everything was such a mess back then.

1415
01:39:43.737 --> 01:39:46.407
In my office. the only record
you had on some kids was...

1416
01:39:48.242 --> 01:39:49.743
just an index card.

1417
01:39:57.251 --> 01:39:58.377
Hello?

1418
01:39:59.253 --> 01:40:00.963
- Terry. is that you?

1419
01:40:00.963 --> 01:40:03.632
<i>Yeah. Y-- Titi--</i>

1420
01:40:04.758 --> 01:40:08.304
I stopped by the group home. but
nobody seems to know where you are.

1421
01:40:08.304 --> 01:40:09.888
<i>I'm at-- I'm at a pay phone.</i>

1422
01:40:09.888 --> 01:40:12.349
<i>I can't stay there.</i>

1423
01:40:12.349 --> 01:40:13.934
You want to meet me back here?

1424
01:40:15.019 --> 01:40:17.354
<i>I want you to come stay with me.</i>

1425
01:40:17.354 --> 01:40:19.523
- Yeah.
-<i>Okay.</i>

1426
01:40:19.523 --> 01:40:22.151
<i>I think you should
stop by the house first.</i>

1427
01:40:22.151 --> 01:40:24.903
pick up any last things
you might want to take with you.

1428
01:40:27.281 --> 01:40:28.699
Yeah.

1429
01:40:28.699 --> 01:40:31.243
-<i>I'll see you soon. baby.</i>
- Okay.

1430
01:40:33.621 --> 01:40:34.747
Okay.

1431
01:41:09.323 --> 01:41:11.992
- Ma?
- Hey. Terry.

1432
01:41:17.289 --> 01:41:18.874
What you-- What you doing?

1433
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.335
I left some things.

1434
01:41:22.169 --> 01:41:24.213
Look. don't stand over there
looking over me.

1435
01:41:24.213 --> 01:41:27.466
I'm sure they already got to you.
so feel free to run along.

1436
01:41:31.428 --> 01:41:32.763
Can we talk. though?

1437
01:41:33.514 --> 01:41:34.682
Talk about what?

1438
01:41:35.808 --> 01:41:37.101
You serious right now?

1439
01:41:40.187 --> 01:41:42.690
Fine. You want to talk. let's talk.

1440
01:41:52.032 --> 01:41:53.534
Fetch me my Newports.

1441
01:41:55.494 --> 01:41:57.830
- You was just over there...
- Over on the stand.

1442
01:42:11.844 --> 01:42:13.178
What you want me to say?

1443
01:42:13.846 --> 01:42:15.639
That I fucked up?

1444
01:42:15.639 --> 01:42:17.474
Yeah. T. I fucked up.

1445
01:42:17.474 --> 01:42:18.809
But life goes on. So what?

1446
01:42:18.809 --> 01:42:20.394
Well. as long as it's your call. right?

1447
01:42:20.394 --> 01:42:22.521
Who was the one who made the choice.
standing in that hospital?

1448
01:42:22.521 --> 01:42:24.273
- Was it you or me?
- Thinking you was my fucking mother!

1449
01:42:24.273 --> 01:42:25.691
Lower your fucking tone!

1450
01:42:26.567 --> 01:42:29.069
You better watch
how the fuck you talking to me.

1451
01:42:31.405 --> 01:42:32.406
Did Lucky know?

1452
01:42:37.911 --> 01:42:39.496
Yes. he knew.

1453
01:42:41.415 --> 01:42:43.667
He didn't agree with it. but he knew.

1454
01:42:44.835 --> 01:42:46.920
Why? Why you do it?

1455
01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:54.470
I don't know why I did it. T.

1456
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:57.181
It was something small
that turned into something else.

1457
01:42:57.181 --> 01:42:59.099
And that's supposed
to make it right or something?

1458
01:42:59.099 --> 01:43:01.101
Who made you the chief
of right or wrong?

1459
01:43:02.311 --> 01:43:04.229
You don't think I have feelings too?

1460
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:07.775
After all those years I took care of you.
who the fuck was there to take care of me?

1461
01:43:07.775 --> 01:43:10.694
I stood up for everybody else!
What the fuck was it for?

1462
01:43:11.779 --> 01:43:13.364
Every chance you had.

1463
01:43:13.364 --> 01:43:15.991
every chance you had.
you turned your back on me!

1464
01:43:15.991 --> 01:43:17.952
- That's not true.
- Oh. please.

1465
01:43:17.952 --> 01:43:20.454
Nobody else give a shit about Black women
except for other Black women.

1466
01:43:20.454 --> 01:43:22.456
and even that shit get messy.

1467
01:43:29.296 --> 01:43:31.298
Who heard me when I was hurt?

1468
01:43:33.968 --> 01:43:35.135
It wasn't you.

1469
01:43:35.970 --> 01:43:37.554
And it damn sure wasn't Lucky.

1470
01:43:37.554 --> 01:43:39.223
But you were my mother!

1471
01:43:40.849 --> 01:43:44.144
Mmm? Now. how am I supposed to feel?

1472
01:44:02.913 --> 01:44:05.332
I need to know what was real.

1473
01:44:20.514 --> 01:44:22.683
I never left you on that corner.

1474
01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:27.730
I was the one that found you.

1475
01:44:32.359 --> 01:44:36.363
Little two-year-old
running around outside the shelter.

1476
01:44:40.034 --> 01:44:43.787
I waited outside on that block
for hours with you.

1477
01:44:45.956 --> 01:44:48.626
Waiting for anybody to show up.

1478
01:44:50.878 --> 01:44:53.422
I saw so much of myself.

1479
01:44:56.383 --> 01:44:59.553
I just... I just wanted
to look out for you.

1480
01:45:01.972 --> 01:45:04.308
I didn't want you getting chewed out
like I was.

1481
01:45:06.018 --> 01:45:09.146
I seen somebody who needed me.

1482
01:45:09.146 --> 01:45:10.314
But...

1483
01:45:11.357 --> 01:45:13.901
But maybe I'm the one who needed you.

1484
01:45:15.027 --> 01:45:16.862
And. T. for that. I'm sorry.

1485
01:45:18.739 --> 01:45:20.699
I'm... I'm sorry.

1486
01:45:25.579 --> 01:45:27.081
I tried to change.

1487
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.253
But I don't-- I don't want it.
I don't want this.

1488
01:45:34.922 --> 01:45:38.384
Not if... Not if it's built on a lie.

1489
01:45:40.094 --> 01:45:44.431
Not if being loved by you or anybody else
means not loving myself.

1490
01:45:47.142 --> 01:45:49.478
They not gonna let you get away with it.

1491
01:45:49.478 --> 01:45:50.771
I ain't going to jail.

1492
01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:54.066
I already know what the fuck
they gonna say anyway.

1493
01:45:54.066 --> 01:45:55.693
Already know. And guess what?

1494
01:45:55.693 --> 01:45:57.736
I don't give a fuck.

1495
01:45:57.736 --> 01:45:59.321
Because I still won.

1496
01:46:00.781 --> 01:46:02.032
I won.

1497
01:46:03.075 --> 01:46:05.786
Because I know you gonna grow up
to be somebody.

1498
01:46:10.416 --> 01:46:13.085
I wish I didn't know.

1499
01:46:16.046 --> 01:46:19.717
I wish-- I wish you could've did a better
job of keeping that lie to yourself.

1500
01:46:20.634 --> 01:46:24.013
I wish it could've continued
so that we could've continued. and I...

1501
01:46:27.683 --> 01:46:29.560
I wish I knew how to be better to you

1502
01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:32.229
so you didn't feel like
you had to leave me alone.

1503
01:46:36.066 --> 01:46:37.484
'Cause I'm scared.

1504
01:46:41.071 --> 01:46:43.741
I'm scared
that I won't have no home no more.

1505
01:46:45.117 --> 01:46:46.577
And one day I'm gonna show up.

1506
01:46:46.577 --> 01:46:49.246
and it's gonna feel like
we ain't never happened.

1507
01:46:51.081 --> 01:46:52.499
Ma!

1508
01:46:53.417 --> 01:46:55.461
Like this wasn't our living room?

1509
01:46:57.087 --> 01:46:58.255
Our home?

1510
01:47:02.676 --> 01:47:04.678
I miss my bed. Ma.

1511
01:47:09.683 --> 01:47:11.685
The one that you made for me.

1512
01:47:21.195 --> 01:47:22.905
Where's home for me now?

1513
01:49:38.248 --> 01:49:39.833
This isn't goodbye.

1514
01:49:41.835 --> 01:49:45.172
I promise. This isn't goodbye. T.

1515
01:49:47.007 --> 01:49:48.175
I promise.

1516
01:49:54.848 --> 01:49:56.100
I love you. Ma.

1517
01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:01.230
I love you.

1518
01:50:06.277 --> 01:50:07.736
I think you should go.

1519
01:51:07.922 --> 01:51:10.716
Okay. miss. Where to?
