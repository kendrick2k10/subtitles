in the town center. over.

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:38.844
- Roger.

9
00:00:38.947 --> 00:00:41.346
Where'd the call
come from. over?

10
00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:43.916
- We've
have several reports now.

11
00:00:44.018 --> 00:00:45.344
Apparently it's
coming from behind

12
00:00:45.446 --> 00:00:47.682
the Alcoholic House. over.

13
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.249
- Roger. Alpha one.

- Roger.
1120. in attendance.

17
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.858
- Where'd you
say the call came from?

18
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.221
- Last
report came from the

19
00:01:26.323 --> 00:01:28.357
Alcoholic House on Queen Street.

20
00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:31.264
He said it sounded like somebody
beating up an animal. over.

21
00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:34.867
- An animal?

22
00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.399
- Yes. confirmed.

23
00:01:36.502 --> 00:01:38.733
Sounded like an animal
in pain is what he said.

24
00:01:44.807 --> 00:01:47.247
- Alpha. I
think I see something now.

25
00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:51.383
It looks like a young male.

26
00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:49.073
- Marjorie. how's
the report going?

27
00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:51.608
- It's all right. I'm
just doing it now.

28
00:02:53.642 --> 00:02:55.312
- This in no way
reflects on you.

29
00:02:55.414 --> 00:02:57.110
You had three very
good cases before.

30
00:02:57.213 --> 00:02:58.681
- I know.

31
00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:01.585
- Personnel says you refused
the offer of counseling.

32
00:03:03.087 --> 00:03:04.121
- I'm alright.

33
00:03:04.223 --> 00:03:06.458
It goes with the territory.

34
00:03:06.727 --> 00:03:07.955
- Good.

35
00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:10.297
- Well. when you're quite ready.
just step inside my office.

36
00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:12.662
There's something I'd like
you to have a little look at.

37
00:03:33.287 --> 00:03:34.751
He's only given us
the name. Nathan.

38
00:03:34.853 --> 00:03:36.883
We think he's under 18. but
with no way of confirming it.

39
00:03:37.152 --> 00:03:39.590
They found him sleeping rough
under the railway arches.

40
00:03:40.123 --> 00:03:41.359
- They?

41
00:03:41.462 --> 00:03:43.693
- The police. they found
him torturing an animal.

42
00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:47.598
There was a struggle and
he assaulted one of them.

43
00:03:48.698 --> 00:03:50.167
Oh. when they got
into the station.

44
00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.399
they realized he had problems.

45
00:03:51.501 --> 00:03:52.972
They took him to be assessed.

46
00:03:53.074 --> 00:03:54.273
And the mental health nurse

47
00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:55.968
very kindly recommended
they bring him here.

48
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.438
What do you expect me to
do at five in the morning?

49
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.504
I've got no idea. he's here.

50
00:03:58.606 --> 00:04:00.842
He's waiting to be seen.

51
00:04:03.546 --> 00:04:05.115
- Can't you give it to Elaine?

52
00:04:05.217 --> 00:04:06.919
She's more than capable.

53
00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:08.683
- Elaine's over booked.

54
00:04:08.786 --> 00:04:10.351
I've got two staff on
long term sick leave.

55
00:04:10.453 --> 00:04:12.484
I've got one on holiday.

56
00:04:13.054 --> 00:04:15.857
I keep telling the
council I need more staff.

57
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:19.630
And that's what I'm asking
you. you're all I've got.

58
00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:21.967
- Thanks.

59
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:23.798
- You know what I mean.

60
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.340
Look. I wouldn't ask you
under these circumstances

61
00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:30.036
if it wasn't
absolutely essential

62
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.907
but the show must go on.

63
00:04:33.808 --> 00:04:36.350
Can't you just.
just take a look?

64
00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:43.387
- Is he violent?

65
00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:45.189
- Well. got no
reason to believe so.

66
00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:46.520
I mean. he did resist arrest.

67
00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:48.858
but that's probably out of fear.

68
00:04:49.827 --> 00:04:52.060
- What about mental health
team. what do they say?

69
00:04:52.462 --> 00:04:54.494
- No obvious psychopathy.

70
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.495
but he seems perfectly
healthy and normal.

71
00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:58.633
He won't talk to us.

72
00:04:58.802 --> 00:05:01.540
Not even a surname.
he's a bit of a mystery.

73
00:05:05.178 --> 00:05:07.211
- There's nothing in here.

74
00:05:07.714 --> 00:05:09.944
There's no medical history.
nothing about family.

75
00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:12.516
Nothing where he's been.

76
00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:14.647
What exactly am I
supposed to do with that?

77
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.083
- Well. I mean.
you had such a good

78
00:05:18.092 --> 00:05:19.524
rapport with the Swan boy.

79
00:05:19.626 --> 00:05:22.022
I thought you might be
able to get it out of him.

80
00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:27.126
- Look. no one could have
known what was gonna happen.

81
00:05:29.904 --> 00:05:31.466
- I should have.

82
00:05:31.568 --> 00:05:33.199
- You win some. you lose some.

83
00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:36.608
You gotta get used to that
if you wanna be a supervisor.

84
00:05:41.578 --> 00:05:43.817
Look. you can't save everybody.

85
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.751
You've gotta focus on those
you can still do something for.

86
00:05:49.488 --> 00:05:51.887
Can't you at least
just have a try?

87
00:06:05.874 --> 00:06:07.699
- Nathan?

88
00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:10.205
Nathan. my name's
Marjorie Dawson.

89
00:06:10.407 --> 00:06:12.646
I'm a social worker.

90
00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.213
Look. I understand the
police arrested you.

91
00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:17.345
but that was just a mistake.

92
00:06:17.614 --> 00:06:19.849
Nobody's gonna harm you now.

93
00:06:22.721 --> 00:06:24.824
It's all right mate.
you can leave us now.

94
00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:25.892
- You sure?

95
00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:28.023
- Yeah. we're fine.

96
00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:30.096
- You wanna keep an eye on him.

97
00:06:30.198 --> 00:06:32.229
He's a vicious little bleeder.

98
00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:34.463
- I find that hard to believe.

99
00:06:34.832 --> 00:06:37.438
You're not gonna attack
me. are you. Nathan?

100
00:06:39.736 --> 00:06:41.970
Honestly. we'll be
fine. thank you.

101
00:06:42.538 --> 00:06:44.775
- It's your funeral.

102
00:06:49.484 --> 00:06:51.815
- You don't seem very
worried or upset?

103
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.150
- Everyone's afraid of me.

104
00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:00.388
- Why is that?

105
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.925
'Cause of the animal you killed?

106
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:05.829
Dog. wasn't it?

107
00:07:06.464 --> 00:07:08.700
What did you want it for?

108
00:07:12.567 --> 00:07:14.808
It's okay.

109
00:07:15.043 --> 00:07:17.076
You can talk to me.

110
00:07:17.612 --> 00:07:20.580
Police are not gonna file
any charges against ya.

111
00:07:22.715 --> 00:07:25.178
Last boy I looked after.
he'd done much worse

112
00:07:27.323 --> 00:07:28.451
And there people
here that have done

113
00:07:28.553 --> 00:07:31.217
some terrible things themselves.

114
00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:36.926
- I wanted it all.

115
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.931
The blood.

116
00:07:40.433 --> 00:07:42.669
It's not good when it's cold.

117
00:07:52.475 --> 00:07:54.713
- I'll take him.

118
00:08:44.527 --> 00:08:46.566
All right?

119
00:08:46.668 --> 00:08:49.834
I know it don't look much.
but at least it's dry.

120
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.070
Come on.

121
00:08:55.873 --> 00:08:58.106
- I've never stayed
indoors before.

122
00:08:59.241 --> 00:09:02.308
- What. do you mean
you've never slept inside?

123
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.951
Hey.

124
00:09:08.253 --> 00:09:09.421
Come on.

125
00:09:09.523 --> 00:09:11.757
It's all right.
I'll be with you.

126
00:09:12.257 --> 00:09:14.287
Let's go

127
00:09:29.303 --> 00:09:32.173
You get your own room
and real bed in it.

128
00:09:38.785 --> 00:09:41.017
Get breakfast. lunch
and dinner as well.

129
00:09:45.055 --> 00:09:47.628
I'm sure you'll get
used to it in time.

130
00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:04.678
There somewhere else
you'd rather be?

131
00:10:14.653 --> 00:10:17.284
You've not touched your tea.

132
00:10:31.901 --> 00:10:33.867
I'm gonna get going now. Nathan.

133
00:10:33.969 --> 00:10:35.134
I'll be back tomorrow. okay?

134
00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:37.373
And there's someone
on duty all night.

135
00:10:37.475 --> 00:10:39.175
His name's Alan.

136
00:10:39.277 --> 00:10:42.408
Everyone thinks he's pretty
cool 'cause he plays a guitar.

137
00:10:43.618 --> 00:10:45.318
It's quiet air this
weekend as well

138
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.117
so enjoy that while it lasts.

139
00:10:50.887 --> 00:10:52.925
You're not a prisoner. you know?

140
00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:56.257
You could leave anytime you
like. the doors are not locked.

141
00:10:57.432 --> 00:11:00.030
But I'd really like you to stay.

142
00:11:01.098 --> 00:11:03.330
I hope you give us a
chance to help you.

143
00:11:06.307 --> 00:11:08.368
Oh. I nearly forgot.

144
00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:11.878
Got this.

145
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:15.013
This belonged to the last
boy that I looked after.

146
00:11:15.715 --> 00:11:17.949
He said it was his
good luck charm.

147
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.349
You can have it.

148
00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:33.393
- The last boy you helped.

149
00:11:35.831 --> 00:11:38.068
did he get better?

150
00:11:38.734 --> 00:11:40.972
- Yeah. he did.

151
00:11:45.578 --> 00:11:48.045
All right. goodnight then.

152
00:16:49.176 --> 00:16:50.779
- Hi. Nathan.

153
00:16:50.881 --> 00:16:52.912
I'm Alan Mayer.

154
00:16:53.214 --> 00:16:55.451
Breakfast's ready.

155
00:17:00.328 --> 00:17:04.328
Well. we'll be in the kitchen
whenever you're ready now.

156
00:17:58.183 --> 00:18:00.417
- Nathan. where
do you come from?

157
00:18:00.985 --> 00:18:03.222
I mean. originally.

158
00:18:09.459 --> 00:18:11.692
You know any friends
or relatives?

159
00:18:12.727 --> 00:18:15.399
is there anybody that
I can call for you?

160
00:18:25.113 --> 00:18:27.477
Nathan. why did you
attack that policeman?

161
00:18:39.222 --> 00:18:41.458
- He was stopping me.

162
00:18:44.127 --> 00:18:46.364
Getting what I need.

163
00:18:55.804 --> 00:18:58.706
- The report says you were
trying to eat that dog.

164
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.348
Did you kill it?

165
00:19:13.154 --> 00:19:15.393
- Yeah.

166
00:19:16.729 --> 00:19:18.761
- Why?

167
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.462
If you were that desperate.

168
00:19:20.565 --> 00:19:22.595
why didn't you just get
something out of a bin

169
00:19:22.764 --> 00:19:26.503
or at the back of a
restaurant or something?

170
00:19:28.172 --> 00:19:30.408
- I wasn't eating it.

171
00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:33.906
- Then I don't understand.

172
00:19:39.117 --> 00:19:41.353
- I wanted it for blood.

173
00:19:46.322 --> 00:19:48.558
The blood of the life.

174
00:20:15.657 --> 00:20:17.686
- Nathan?

175
00:20:20.859 --> 00:20:22.155
Nathan?

176
00:20:22.257 --> 00:20:24.495
You all right?

177
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.292
You seem very busy.
how's it going?

178
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.154
- Okay.

179
00:20:55.256 --> 00:20:56.928
Okay.

180
00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.963
It's hard to ask someone

181
00:20:58.065 --> 00:20:59.364
if they've been abused or not

182
00:20:59.466 --> 00:21:01.026
when all you know about
them is their first name.

183
00:21:01.128 --> 00:21:03.567
Have we still not got anything
as all on his parents?

184
00:21:04.504 --> 00:21:06.867
- Well. the police have
checked their records.

185
00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.570
So far. no one's been reported

186
00:21:09.672 --> 00:21:11.910
as missing that matches
his description.

187
00:21:12.212 --> 00:21:14.446
They're checking
the other forces.

188
00:21:15.314 --> 00:21:17.116
- What about DNA
and fingerprints?

189
00:21:17.218 --> 00:21:19.250
- Well. they took
them at the station.

190
00:21:19.419 --> 00:21:20.886
but either he's never
done anything wrong

191
00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:22.448
or he's never been caught.

192
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.515
Has he said anything?

193
00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.854
- One or two things.

194
00:21:28.395 --> 00:21:30.627
Do you know what the
blood of the life means?

195
00:21:31.227 --> 00:21:33.132
- No. why?

196
00:21:33.234 --> 00:21:35.467
- No. it's just
something that he said.

197
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.002
Probably not important.

198
00:21:37.104 --> 00:21:39.069
- I'll leave you to carry on.

199
00:21:39.171 --> 00:21:40.536
Oh. I'm up to my eyes

200
00:21:40.638 --> 00:21:42.605
and I've got five new
cases coming today

201
00:21:42.707 --> 00:21:44.738
and God knows where they
think I'm gonna put them.

202
00:21:45.007 --> 00:21:47.611
The sooner you get him through
the system. the better.

203
00:21:48.412 --> 00:21:50.409
Well. keep up the good work.

204
00:22:55.344 --> 00:22:57.078
- You want that?

205
00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.419
Stab me.

206
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.499
So. what are you in for?

207
00:23:17.336 --> 00:23:19.571
You're quiet.
That's cool.

208
00:23:20.272 --> 00:23:22.040
I got done selling weed.

209
00:23:22.142 --> 00:23:24.171
You know. wacky backer.

210
00:23:24.406 --> 00:23:26.375
Made a fortune.

211
00:23:26.477 --> 00:23:27.772
But then my stepdad found out

212
00:23:27.874 --> 00:23:31.550
and that's how I ended up here.

213
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.584
My real dad's in
Australia though.

214
00:23:34.886 --> 00:23:37.116
That's where I'm going as
soon as I get out of here.

215
00:23:38.057 --> 00:23:40.086
What about you?

216
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.794
- I killed a dog and ate it.

217
00:23:47.762 --> 00:23:50.602
- Well. it's just a sandwich.

218
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:04.203
- You said you don't
remember your parents.

219
00:25:05.378 --> 00:25:06.939
You've been able to remember

220
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:09.274
anything about
where you come from?

221
00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:20.318
I was wondering. have you ever
been in a church or a mosque?

222
00:25:21.627 --> 00:25:24.564
Any kind of organized
religion thing?

223
00:25:26.132 --> 00:25:28.161
A cult maybe.

224
00:25:37.837 --> 00:25:40.074
What about friends?

225
00:25:41.649 --> 00:25:43.880
You can't have been on
your own your entire life.

226
00:25:44.513 --> 00:25:46.751
Must be someone.

227
00:25:49.056 --> 00:25:51.085
- No one.

228
00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:55.826
- Don't worry.
you've got me now.

229
00:26:58.488 --> 00:27:00.492
Hey Nathan.

230
00:27:00.594 --> 00:27:02.827
I'm just gonna ask
you a few questions.

231
00:27:03.729 --> 00:27:05.495
It's just so the
people that I work for

232
00:27:05.597 --> 00:27:07.398
can see that I'm helping you

233
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.363
'cause that's my job. you see?

234
00:27:08.465 --> 00:27:10.703
To help people.

235
00:27:13.605 --> 00:27:15.840
- People like me?
- Yeah.

236
00:27:20.211 --> 00:27:23.441
You told me that you killed
the dog to drink it's blood.

237
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:27.984
Why do do you like
to kill animals?

238
00:27:31.718 --> 00:27:33.957
- Dogs

239
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.621
are easier.

240
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:39.127
Cats are easier to.

241
00:27:40.797 --> 00:27:43.032
- Easier than what. Nathan?

242
00:27:43.566 --> 00:27:45.804
Than people?

243
00:27:48.304 --> 00:27:53.174
Nathan. are you saying you'd
hunt people if you could?

244
00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:57.376
It's okay. nothing you tell
me is gonna leave this room.

245
00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.418
- Animals are okay

246
00:28:07.525 --> 00:28:09.762
when you're hungry.

247
00:28:15.565 --> 00:28:17.434
- All right.

248
00:28:17.536 --> 00:28:19.772
We'll come back to that.

249
00:28:22.905 --> 00:28:23.936
I asked you if you remembered

250
00:28:24.038 --> 00:28:26.273
anything about your childhood.

251
00:28:29.079 --> 00:28:31.311
Sometimes it's easier
to remember things

252
00:28:32.345 --> 00:28:36.019
if you just sit and
close your eyes.

253
00:28:36.785 --> 00:28:38.716
- I don't like to.

254
00:28:38.819 --> 00:28:40.523
- Why not?

255
00:28:40.625 --> 00:28:42.861
- You can get attacked.

256
00:28:44.225 --> 00:28:46.491
People are weak
when they're asleep.

257
00:28:49.965 --> 00:28:52.200
- Do you like girls. Nathan?

258
00:28:55.638 --> 00:28:57.876
- Sometimes.

259
00:28:59.072 --> 00:29:01.440
- What about other times?

260
00:29:03.448 --> 00:29:05.477
It depends.

261
00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.018
- On what?

262
00:29:14.662 --> 00:29:17.489
What do you think
about me. Nathan?

263
00:29:21.433 --> 00:29:23.463
- You're old.

264
00:29:23.699 --> 00:29:25.937
Older woman

265
00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:29.270
wearing brown.

266
00:29:33.074 --> 00:29:35.309
You have weak arms and legs.

267
00:29:38.519 --> 00:29:40.286
You couldn't run very fast.

268
00:29:40.388 --> 00:29:42.415
I'd catch you easily.

269
00:29:46.085 --> 00:29:48.326
You're nervous now.

270
00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:50.555
I can hear you breathing

271
00:29:54.867 --> 00:29:57.100
And you have a
stain on you. there.

272
00:30:31.035 --> 00:30:33.270
- Sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

273
00:30:33.572 --> 00:30:34.506
- Sorry. my fault.

274
00:30:34.608 --> 00:30:36.634
I was miles away. just reading.

275
00:30:38.911 --> 00:30:40.640
- How you getting on
with that new boy?

276
00:30:40.743 --> 00:30:41.807
- Nathan?

277
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:42.843
Yeah. good.

278
00:30:42.945 --> 00:30:44.378
He's truly opening up.

279
00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.018
In fact. I think we're on
the verge of a breakthrough.

280
00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:50.120
- Really?
I thought he was catatonic.

281
00:30:51.123 --> 00:30:53.354
- No. you just have to
know how to speak to them.

282
00:30:54.491 --> 00:30:56.929
Once they know that you're
there for them no matter what.

283
00:30:57.861 --> 00:31:00.097
they tell you everything.

284
00:31:02.737 --> 00:31:03.667
- I've been meaning
to talk to you.

285
00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:05.799
you know. about what happened.

286
00:31:06.301 --> 00:31:07.464
It must have been
terrible for you.

287
00:31:07.566 --> 00:31:10.305
You know. finding
that boy like that.

288
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.211
I don't know what I'd do. you
know. if one of my boys OD'd.

289
00:31:16.276 --> 00:31:18.511
Said you've refused counseling.

290
00:31:19.246 --> 00:31:20.614
- Mr. Josh put you up to this?

291
00:31:20.717 --> 00:31:22.752
- No. no.

292
00:31:23.321 --> 00:31:25.554
You know. I was just concerned
'cause of what happened.

293
00:31:25.656 --> 00:31:26.951
I thought--

294
00:31:27.053 --> 00:31:28.552
- I'm fine.

295
00:31:28.655 --> 00:31:31.260
Thanks for your concern.
but honestly I'm fine.

296
00:31:37.602 --> 00:31:38.963
- Really?

297
00:31:39.065 --> 00:31:41.004
What's that?

298
00:31:41.107 --> 00:31:43.602
- Just exploring some
different possibilities.

299
00:31:45.076 --> 00:31:47.106
He's just in the
grip of a delusion.

300
00:31:47.409 --> 00:31:50.147
- Yeah. well delusions
can be dangerous.

301
00:31:51.482 --> 00:31:52.581
You know. you don't have to
deal with this on your own.

302
00:31:52.683 --> 00:31:54.313
I can help you.

303
00:31:54.415 --> 00:31:55.819
I can sit on the
interviews with you.

304
00:31:55.921 --> 00:31:57.952
Like you said. if
he's opening up.

305
00:31:58.054 --> 00:32:00.292
Two heads are better than one.

306
00:32:00.694 --> 00:32:02.720
- Yeah. I let you know. cheers.

307
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.407
- Where you going?

308
00:32:20.809 --> 00:32:23.048
- Out.

309
00:32:24.817 --> 00:32:26.780
- Saw you go out the other day.

310
00:32:26.882 --> 00:32:29.120
Where'd you go?

311
00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.886
- Nowhere.

312
00:32:30.988 --> 00:32:33.224
- Don't go all psycho on me.

313
00:32:33.993 --> 00:32:36.023
Look. I know loads
of people in town.

314
00:32:36.393 --> 00:32:38.756
Big time dealers. we can
go score if you want.

315
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.727
Gotta watch it though.

316
00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:46.698
It'd be safer if we go together.

317
00:32:51.042 --> 00:32:53.276
All right. I lied
about the weed.

318
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.379
Know why I really got sent here?

319
00:32:56.481 --> 00:33:00.085
My parents both died when our
boat turned over on holiday.

320
00:33:01.185 --> 00:33:02.446
Right in the middle
of the ocean.

321
00:33:02.548 --> 00:33:04.782
I was the only one
that got saved.

322
00:33:06.654 --> 00:33:09.094
Could really do with
getting out of here though.

323
00:33:09.892 --> 00:33:12.130
- Oi!

324
00:33:13.093 --> 00:33:13.960
What's going on?

325
00:33:14.062 --> 00:33:15.626
- It's only. Alan.

326
00:33:15.728 --> 00:33:18.334
Give him some drama and
he won't tell on us.

327
00:33:21.508 --> 00:33:23.541
Tomorrow?

328
00:33:23.676 --> 00:33:25.704
It's a date. yeah?

329
00:33:38.052 --> 00:33:40.086
- Okay. Nathan.

330
00:33:40.321 --> 00:33:41.886
Now you were telling me you like

331
00:33:41.988 --> 00:33:46.824
to drink the blood of animals.
but you didn't tell me why.

332
00:33:49.562 --> 00:33:51.796
- Something on
your mind. Nathan?

333
00:33:56.769 --> 00:33:59.540
- All right. let's talk
about something else

334
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.313
That day when the
police found you.

335
00:34:04.179 --> 00:34:06.415
where did you come from?

336
00:34:08.786 --> 00:34:10.815
- I walked.

337
00:34:13.527 --> 00:34:15.427
- Where from?

338
00:34:15.529 --> 00:34:17.558
- Don't know.

339
00:34:17.927 --> 00:34:20.165
I walk a lot.

340
00:34:21.762 --> 00:34:24.235
- How long have you
lived on the streets for?

341
00:34:26.099 --> 00:34:28.032
A week?

342
00:34:28.134 --> 00:34:29.902
Month?

343
00:34:30.004 --> 00:34:32.243
Longer?

344
00:34:36.716 --> 00:34:38.744
- Don't remember.

345
00:34:41.553 --> 00:34:44.849
Do you remember anything at
all about where you came from?

346
00:34:47.726 --> 00:34:49.755
- Just dreams.

347
00:34:58.737 --> 00:35:00.766
- Like what?

348
00:35:05.877 --> 00:35:07.905
I remember a town.

349
00:35:09.915 --> 00:35:13.680
A castle over a field.

350
00:35:15.251 --> 00:35:18.256
- Is that where you came from?

351
00:35:18.957 --> 00:35:21.193
- No. there were men.

352
00:35:22.662 --> 00:35:24.691
Soldiers.

353
00:35:25.833 --> 00:35:28.497
The walls fell. I ran away.

354
00:35:32.267 --> 00:35:34.503
- Where did you go next?

355
00:35:37.139 --> 00:35:39.376
- I can't remember.

356
00:35:40.845 --> 00:35:42.874
I see faces.

357
00:35:44.518 --> 00:35:46.548
More men

358
00:35:47.854 --> 00:35:49.914
and the other golden bird.

359
00:35:51.891 --> 00:35:53.918
Long knives in their hand.

360
00:35:56.357 --> 00:35:58.593
- You mean like swords?

361
00:36:01.431 --> 00:36:04.401
What about the faces.
what do they do?

362
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.670
We have to burn them.
it's the only way.

363
00:36:14.815 --> 00:36:16.813
I have to go sleep now.

364
00:36:16.915 --> 00:36:17.715
But I don't want to.

365
00:36:17.817 --> 00:36:19.845
I want to remember.

366
00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:24.289
- What happens when you sleep?

367
00:36:26.689 --> 00:36:29.888
- That's how I get away
from them. the faces.

368
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.958
I sleep for a long time.

369
00:36:33.461 --> 00:36:35.696
When wake up. they're gone.

370
00:36:36.462 --> 00:36:38.699
They're all gone.

371
00:36:42.306 --> 00:36:44.903
I wake up.
everything's different.

372
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.908
Castle's are gone.

373
00:36:54.284 --> 00:36:56.519
- How long do you sleep for?

374
00:36:58.451 --> 00:37:00.688
I don't remember.

375
00:37:06.999 --> 00:37:09.026
Nathan. how old are you?

376
00:37:11.838 --> 00:37:12.970
- I don't remember.

377
00:37:13.073 --> 00:37:15.101
- All right. can
we stop the tape

378
00:37:15.203 --> 00:37:17.441
and have a word?

379
00:37:21.044 --> 00:37:23.080
- What is it?

380
00:37:23.382 --> 00:37:25.616
- It's a delusion and
you are feeding it.

381
00:37:25.785 --> 00:37:27.815
- What. how?

382
00:37:28.384 --> 00:37:29.650
By trying to understand him?

383
00:37:29.752 --> 00:37:32.918
- Come on. he needs
medication and counseling.

384
00:37:34.059 --> 00:37:35.957
- We were making progress.

385
00:37:36.059 --> 00:37:38.030
- No we weren't.

386
00:37:38.132 --> 00:37:39.693
He was just feeding
you this story

387
00:37:39.795 --> 00:37:42.664
and you were swallowing
everything he was saying.

388
00:37:44.402 --> 00:37:46.432
- You heard him. he
was in a war zone.

389
00:37:46.667 --> 00:37:50.573
- God. what. where
they had swords?

390
00:37:53.641 --> 00:37:55.540
I'm telling you
this as a friend.

391
00:37:55.642 --> 00:37:57.881
If you went to charge with this.

392
00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.049
they'd laugh you out the office.

393
00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:02.387
- So we're back to me.

394
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:05.621
- This kid is telling
you a fantastical story

395
00:38:07.455 --> 00:38:09.691
and you are believing it.

396
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.894
- He trusts me.
He was opening up.

397
00:38:16.066 --> 00:38:18.469
- How. by lying?

398
00:38:19.902 --> 00:38:22.135
He's just trying to get you
on his side. that's all.

399
00:38:22.704 --> 00:38:25.102
Teenagers can be
manipulative. you know?

400
00:38:27.811 --> 00:38:30.041
Do you really think that
he was attacked by soldiers

401
00:38:32.513 --> 00:38:34.416
and escaped by hibernating

402
00:38:34.518 --> 00:38:37.048
until everything
around him disappeared?

403
00:38:40.025 --> 00:38:42.053
- I'm not stupid.

404
00:38:43.596 --> 00:38:45.826
- I'm really glad you're
getting yourself back to work.

405
00:38:47.162 --> 00:38:49.131
I am.

406
00:38:49.233 --> 00:38:50.433
I'm just a bit concerned

407
00:38:50.535 --> 00:38:52.767
he might be taking you
for a bit of a ride.

408
00:38:54.701 --> 00:39:00.071
- I do have to be on my own.

409
00:40:27.233 --> 00:40:29.633
- Have you seen the new kid?

410
00:40:34.272 --> 00:40:36.541
Don't eat much. does he?

411
00:40:37.604 --> 00:40:39.841
- Hadn't noticed.

412
00:41:02.429 --> 00:41:04.668
- Shit!

413
00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:07.836
Call the ambulance!

414
00:41:14.006 --> 00:41:15.740
- Anemia. ame me
more than likely.

415
00:41:15.842 --> 00:41:17.678
Should have brought him before.

416
00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.013
- It has been a
little bit difficult.

417
00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.950
- Right.

418
00:41:23.652 --> 00:41:25.084
I have to give you a little exam

419
00:41:25.186 --> 00:41:28.087
just to make sure you don't
have any diseases. okay?

420
00:41:29.123 --> 00:41:31.563
Let's start by having a
little listen. shall we?

421
00:41:37.465 --> 00:41:39.703
Breathe in.

422
00:41:40.501 --> 00:41:42.739
Breathe out.

423
00:41:44.538 --> 00:41:46.776
Breath in.

424
00:41:47.376 --> 00:41:49.614
Breathe out.

425
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.314
Any fever.

426
00:41:52.516 --> 00:41:55.279
headaches. dizziness. itchiness?

427
00:41:56.188 --> 00:41:58.216
Any pains anywhere?

428
00:42:00.554 --> 00:42:02.589
That seems fine.

429
00:42:03.058 --> 00:42:06.323
I'd just like to take a
little blood sample then.

430
00:42:17.773 --> 00:42:20.876
You can just raise
up your sleeve.

431
00:42:21.873 --> 00:42:24.110
- Nathan!
Nathan!

432
00:42:27.382 --> 00:42:28.820
Nathan?

433
00:42:28.922 --> 00:42:30.952
Nathan?

434
00:42:35.159 --> 00:42:36.361
Nathan.

435
00:42:36.463 --> 00:42:38.696
Nathan. it's all
right. it's alright.

436
00:42:40.066 --> 00:42:41.059
It's okay.

437
00:42:41.161 --> 00:42:42.760
Honestly. we're not
gonna do this test now.

438
00:42:42.862 --> 00:42:44.227
We're not gonna do it.

439
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:46.563
We need to go back in
just for one minute.

440
00:42:47.032 --> 00:42:49.105
One more. little quick thing.

441
00:42:49.207 --> 00:42:50.367
We're done.

442
00:42:50.469 --> 00:42:52.908
I'm gonna stay with you
every single step of the way.

443
00:42:53.377 --> 00:42:55.413
I'll be with you.

444
00:42:55.615 --> 00:42:57.847
I'm gonna make sure that
you are right. okay?

445
00:42:58.447 --> 00:43:00.685
You trust me?

446
00:43:14.932 --> 00:43:16.962
- Okay. well. we'll skip
the blood test for now.

447
00:43:17.131 --> 00:43:19.363
Just keep an eye out
for some symptoms. hey?

448
00:43:20.606 --> 00:43:22.839
You don't mind if
we do an oral exam?

449
00:43:24.011 --> 00:43:26.040
Open wide.

450
00:43:26.541 --> 00:43:28.779
Open. sorry.

451
00:43:32.712 --> 00:43:34.950
And underneath.

452
00:43:37.057 --> 00:43:39.088
Say. "Ah."

453
00:43:52.398 --> 00:43:54.838
Look. if I was you I'd
get a second opinion.

454
00:43:55.738 --> 00:43:56.835
I mean. I'd even get a third.

455
00:43:56.937 --> 00:43:58.169
I've done as much as I can.

456
00:43:58.272 --> 00:43:59.741
You haven't even told us
what's wrong with him.

457
00:43:59.843 --> 00:44:01.240
- Look. he has
something up his tongue.

458
00:44:01.342 --> 00:44:03.781
I've not seen anything like
it apart from an animal's.

459
00:44:04.481 --> 00:44:05.578
- Is it dangerous?

460
00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.080
- I don't think so.

461
00:44:07.182 --> 00:44:08.786
But I mean. I could
speculate on it's purpose.

462
00:44:08.888 --> 00:44:11.118
Look. I know some friends
who run a medical facility.

463
00:44:12.018 --> 00:44:13.257
They can have a look at him.

464
00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:14.856
They'd pay you to do it.

465
00:44:14.959 --> 00:44:17.128
- That's not. I don't
think I could do that.

466
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.955
It's not my place.

467
00:44:18.057 --> 00:44:19.461
- Please. just take the card.

468
00:44:19.563 --> 00:44:21.594
Have a think about it.

469
00:44:21.729 --> 00:44:23.762
Phone this number.

470
00:44:23.898 --> 00:44:26.136
Tell them I recommended you.

471
00:44:26.371 --> 00:44:27.865
They pay very well.

472
00:44:27.967 --> 00:44:30.401
It's fascinating. really.

473
00:46:45.244 --> 00:46:46.244
- Hi.

474
00:46:46.346 --> 00:46:48.374
Are you Valentin?

475
00:46:49.513 --> 00:46:51.111
- Who's asking?

476
00:46:51.213 --> 00:46:54.446
- We spoke by email
yesterday. I'm Marjorie.

477
00:46:55.453 --> 00:46:56.751
- Who's this?

478
00:46:56.853 --> 00:46:59.088
She looks like a tax inspector.

479
00:46:59.922 --> 00:47:01.593
- I wanted to know a bit more

480
00:47:01.695 --> 00:47:04.522
about you all
being. you know ...

481
00:47:06.497 --> 00:47:08.526
Vampires.

482
00:47:10.129 --> 00:47:12.365
- Let me talk to her.

483
00:47:19.543 --> 00:47:21.572
Have a seat.

484
00:47:32.053 --> 00:47:34.020
- The site said after midnight.

485
00:47:34.122 --> 00:47:37.291
So I thought I'd
just come and see.

486
00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:40.090
Just. I've got some questions.

487
00:47:40.192 --> 00:47:41.961
- I've got a few for you.

488
00:47:42.063 --> 00:47:43.464
Do you work for the police?

489
00:47:43.567 --> 00:47:44.335
- No. no.

490
00:47:44.437 --> 00:47:45.602
I'm a social worker.

491
00:47:45.704 --> 00:47:47.939
- You don't work for the church?

492
00:47:48.774 --> 00:47:50.104
Not come to rid
me of my evil ways

493
00:47:50.206 --> 00:47:52.438
or for corrupting
the mind's of others?

494
00:47:53.545 --> 00:47:55.375
So what do you want?

495
00:47:55.544 --> 00:48:01.051
- I've got a young boy that
I'm working with and he thinks.

496
00:48:03.688 --> 00:48:05.717
he thinks he's like you.

497
00:48:06.053 --> 00:48:08.289
He wants to drink blood.

498
00:48:09.857 --> 00:48:11.595
- How old is he?

499
00:48:11.697 --> 00:48:15.164
- 16. 17. we're not too sure.

500
00:48:15.965 --> 00:48:18.001
We found him on the street.

501
00:48:18.203 --> 00:48:23.172
I'm just trying to find someone
similar who can tell me.

502
00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:26.037
can it be reversed?

503
00:48:26.139 --> 00:48:28.375
- You mean like a cure?

504
00:48:29.815 --> 00:48:31.245
There's not really
a cure for it.

505
00:48:31.347 --> 00:48:34.282
You either drink blood
or you don't drink blood.

506
00:48:36.522 --> 00:48:38.554
- She's still here?

507
00:48:38.889 --> 00:48:41.124
- She wants to know what we do.

508
00:48:44.157 --> 00:48:46.393
- Why don't we show you.

509
00:49:33.074 --> 00:49:35.109
Maybe I should just go.

510
00:49:35.211 --> 00:49:37.576
- Don't worry. it's
safe enough here.

511
00:49:40.919 --> 00:49:43.153
I was 15 when I
first drank blood.

512
00:49:44.723 --> 00:49:46.289
First I drank my own.

513
00:49:46.391 --> 00:49:49.654
Then I discovered the internet
and other people like me.

514
00:49:51.092 --> 00:49:53.328
Now we're everywhere.

515
00:49:55.595 --> 00:49:59.268
- But I thought you
like to hunt people.

516
00:50:01.006 --> 00:50:03.239
- God. no.
What do you think we are?

517
00:50:03.908 --> 00:50:06.143
We never take anything by force.

518
00:50:06.744 --> 00:50:08.340
- Is it dangerous?

519
00:50:08.442 --> 00:50:10.680
- What we do here is
purely consensual.

520
00:50:10.882 --> 00:50:13.117
We only drink from each other.

521
00:50:13.884 --> 00:50:15.249
We never sleep around.

522
00:50:15.351 --> 00:50:18.056
We get tested for
diseases once a month

523
00:50:19.056 --> 00:50:21.290
and we never drink
from strangers.

524
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:26.559
- So. it's a compulsion?

525
00:50:27.634 --> 00:50:29.661
- Does it disgust you?

526
00:50:31.165 --> 00:50:33.129
Are you appalled by us?

527
00:50:33.231 --> 00:50:35.469
- Should I be?

528
00:50:37.669 --> 00:50:39.903
Sorry. I think I've
wasted your time.

529
00:50:40.238 --> 00:50:41.943
- Wait a minute.

530
00:50:42.045 --> 00:50:44.280
How real do you want this to be?

531
00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:47.382
When we don't drink
blood. we get sick.

532
00:50:48.248 --> 00:50:50.484
Real physical sickness.

533
00:50:51.417 --> 00:50:53.023
What do you want me to say?

534
00:50:53.126 --> 00:50:55.357
That my name's Steven
and I work in insurance?

535
00:50:56.026 --> 00:50:58.054
And Talia's an art student?

536
00:50:58.656 --> 00:51:00.197
That's what we are
during the day.

537
00:51:00.299 --> 00:51:03.464
But when we come here.
we're whoever we want to be.

538
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:07.166
You get that?

539
00:51:07.268 --> 00:51:09.503
We're here living our dreams.

540
00:51:10.271 --> 00:51:12.506
Reality is all in the mind.

541
00:51:13.238 --> 00:51:15.476
- Not for me.

542
00:51:17.145 --> 00:51:19.381
Thank you for your time.

543
00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:23.847
- What is it you want to see?

544
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:26.788
- What's her problem?

545
00:52:27.183 --> 00:52:29.583
You're just gonna sit there?

546
00:52:32.319 --> 00:52:34.555
Please eat something.

547
00:52:47.171 --> 00:52:48.933
Nathan. I'm so
worried about you.

548
00:52:49.035 --> 00:52:52.870
but I can't help you if you
won't tell me what's wrong.

549
00:52:54.907 --> 00:52:57.644
Are you're trying to
starve yourself to death?

550
00:53:07.288 --> 00:53:09.524
- You don't believe me.

551
00:53:10.663 --> 00:53:12.692
- Believe what?

552
00:53:14.527 --> 00:53:15.426
If this carries on they're gonna

553
00:53:15.528 --> 00:53:17.763
take you away to a hospital.

554
00:53:18.365 --> 00:53:20.601
Is that what you want?

555
00:53:22.873 --> 00:53:24.902
- I'm not sick.

556
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:27.740
I'm hungry.

557
00:53:28.409 --> 00:53:31.007
Are you sick when you're hungry?

558
00:53:40.451 --> 00:53:41.386
- What is that?

559
00:53:41.488 --> 00:53:43.822
That thing under your tongue?

560
00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:47.826
Has it always been there?

561
00:53:50.131 --> 00:53:52.369
Does it hurt?

562
00:53:54.368 --> 00:53:56.604
- It feels like I'm dying.

563
00:54:00.207 --> 00:54:02.445
I'm hungry.

564
00:54:12.222 --> 00:54:14.457
- Tell me how I can help you.

565
00:54:19.029 --> 00:54:20.292
- Oh.
- Sorry.

566
00:54:20.394 --> 00:54:22.427
- Marjorie. you all right?

567
00:54:23.029 --> 00:54:25.468
- I've been thinking. you
know. about what you're saying?

568
00:54:26.199 --> 00:54:27.569
- Yeah?

569
00:54:27.671 --> 00:54:30.737
About talking. everything
that happened with Curtis.

570
00:54:32.341 --> 00:54:34.577
And I'd like to. if that's okay.

571
00:54:34.912 --> 00:54:35.746
- Yeah. good.

572
00:54:35.848 --> 00:54:37.040
- Is that all right?

573
00:54:37.142 --> 00:54:38.241
- Maybe should go somewhere
a bit more private though.

574
00:54:38.343 --> 00:54:40.378
- Yeah.

575
00:54:40.814 --> 00:54:43.046
- Do you think we could
go to the care home?

576
00:54:43.954 --> 00:54:44.880
- Care home?

577
00:54:44.982 --> 00:54:47.216
- Just that. that's
where it happened

578
00:54:47.919 --> 00:54:49.991
and everything
that went on there.

579
00:54:50.093 --> 00:54:51.225
- No. I understand.

580
00:54:51.327 --> 00:54:52.456
- I feel. is that all right?

581
00:54:52.558 --> 00:54:54.296
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

582
00:54:54.398 --> 00:54:56.198
Are you free now?
I can take us there.

583
00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:58.334
- Yeah. I'll just
grab your coat.

584
00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.496
I'll put a note in the diary
so they no where we've gone.

585
00:55:00.598 --> 00:55:01.999
- Cheers. brilliant.

586
00:55:02.101 --> 00:55:04.336
- I'm really glad you've decided
to ask for help. you know?

587
00:55:05.005 --> 00:55:07.444
'Cause we all need a sympathetic
ear every now and then.

588
00:55:32.038 --> 00:55:33.637
- That's where I found him.

589
00:55:33.739 --> 00:55:35.139
- Yeah.

590
00:55:35.241 --> 00:55:37.474
- And keeping a secret
stash of heroin.

591
00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:39.635
No one knew.

592
00:55:39.904 --> 00:55:41.675
- Must have been
terrible for you.

593
00:55:41.777 --> 00:55:44.008
You can't keep blaming
yourself though. you know?

594
00:55:44.677 --> 00:55:46.912
No. I know now. it was my fault.

595
00:55:48.187 --> 00:55:50.421
He trusted me and
I let him down.

596
00:55:51.619 --> 00:55:53.320
I think this is
my second chance.

597
00:55:53.422 --> 00:55:56.020
- Yeah. everybody gets one.

598
00:55:59.263 --> 00:56:01.060
- Just in the corner over there.

599
00:56:01.162 --> 00:56:02.391
- Yeah.

600
00:56:02.494 --> 00:56:04.034
Come here.

601
00:56:04.136 --> 00:56:06.668
Come on. it'll be all right.

602
00:58:36.951 --> 00:58:40.888
Everything will be
all right. you'll see.

603
00:58:43.362 --> 00:58:44.656
I've spent my life
helping people

604
00:58:44.758 --> 00:58:46.996
with no one else to turn to.

605
00:58:47.298 --> 00:58:49.327
People who didn't fit in.

606
00:58:49.996 --> 00:58:52.229
Who couldn't look
after themselves.

607
00:58:53.568 --> 00:58:55.805
I won't leave you now.

608
00:58:56.341 --> 00:58:58.741
It'll be all right. you'll see.

609
00:59:00.004 --> 00:59:02.712
Everything's gonna be fine.

610
00:59:16.589 --> 00:59:18.827
Better now?

611
01:01:42.467 --> 01:01:44.908
- Marjorie. I'm gonna
be tied up for a bit.

612
01:01:45.177 --> 01:01:45.770
Take my calls.

613
01:01:45.872 --> 01:01:47.707
- Is everything okay?

614
01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:49.844
- It's Elaine. she's missing.

615
01:01:49.946 --> 01:01:52.181
Her family hasn't
seen her for two days.

616
01:01:52.283 --> 01:01:52.976
- Her family?

617
01:01:53.078 --> 01:01:54.377
I thought she was divorced.

618
01:01:54.479 --> 01:01:56.014
- Yes. but she's got two
children. boy and a girl.

619
01:01:56.116 --> 01:01:58.116
They've been looked
after by an uncle.

620
01:01:58.219 --> 01:02:00.454
Apparently didn't come
home the other night.

621
01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:02.318
I know I'm gonna have to
reallocate all her work.

622
01:02:02.421 --> 01:02:04.595
I don't know where I'm
supposed to move it to.

623
01:02:04.697 --> 01:02:06.323
They're not gonna
give us anybody else.

624
01:02:06.425 --> 01:02:08.664
And now. I've gotta speak
to the police as well.

625
01:02:08.833 --> 01:02:11.098
They're trying to
retrace her movements.

626
01:02:49.575 --> 01:02:51.607
- Yes?
- Sorry to interrupt.

627
01:02:52.043 --> 01:02:54.070
Printer's jammed. I really
need that court document.

628
01:02:54.372 --> 01:02:55.838
I've gotta get going
in a few minutes.

629
01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.877
- No. really?

630
01:02:57.979 --> 01:03:00.213
That's the second
time this week.

631
01:03:00.912 --> 01:03:02.947
Oh. right.

632
01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:04.714
Excuse me.
- Okay.

633
01:03:04.816 --> 01:03:05.917
- Sorry.

634
01:03:06.019 --> 01:03:07.116
- It's all right.

635
01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:09.153
Well just let me grab that.

636
01:03:09.255 --> 01:03:10.185
Do you want anything.
tea or coffee?

637
01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:11.327
- No. I'm all right. thank you.

638
01:03:11.429 --> 01:03:13.457
- All right. cheers.

639
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.369
- Nathan?

640
01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.538
Do you wanna go to the shops?

641
01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.577
Did I tell you I won
the lottery once?

642
01:03:30.779 --> 01:03:32.008
It's in a trust fund.

643
01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:34.346
Can't get it 'til I'm 18.

644
01:04:19.991 --> 01:04:22.229
- Nathan?

645
01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.628
What have you done?

646
01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:29.768
Jesus Christ.

647
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:32.107
You fucking nutcase.

648
01:04:47.556 --> 01:04:48.517
- Hey.

649
01:04:48.619 --> 01:04:51.060
Maybe they won't come
looking after all.

650
01:04:55.427 --> 01:04:57.660
I should have
planned this better.

651
01:05:00.935 --> 01:05:03.171
This is all my fault.

652
01:05:05.773 --> 01:05:07.804
It's so stupid.

653
01:05:08.073 --> 01:05:10.310
Can you forgive me?

654
01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:18.414
- Sorry about this.

655
01:05:18.516 --> 01:05:19.719
But we have to check
up on every lead.

656
01:05:19.821 --> 01:05:21.251
- No. I understand.

657
01:05:21.353 --> 01:05:22.922
- Ms. Harding sent
a text message

658
01:05:23.024 --> 01:05:24.490
from her phone to her ex-husband

659
01:05:24.592 --> 01:05:26.822
about picking her kids up
the day that she disappeared.

660
01:05:27.692 --> 01:05:29.931
It also said that she
was coming here with you

661
01:05:30.033 --> 01:05:31.961
and then she'd be
making her way home.

662
01:05:32.063 --> 01:05:33.465
- That's right.

663
01:05:33.567 --> 01:05:35.802
I brought her up from the
office. brought her with me.

664
01:05:36.304 --> 01:05:38.536
I got a new boy now.
he's pretty vulnerable.

665
01:05:40.442 --> 01:05:42.674
I thought she might be able
to help me out with him.

666
01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:43.777
- Did she?

667
01:05:43.879 --> 01:05:44.946
- Yeah. she was amazing.

668
01:05:45.048 --> 01:05:46.848
I couldn't have
managed without her.

669
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:48.246
She didn't stay
that long though.

670
01:05:48.348 --> 01:05:50.680
About an hour or so
and then she left.

671
01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:54.423
- Can I ask how?

672
01:05:54.592 --> 01:05:55.656
- What'd you mean?

673
01:05:55.758 --> 01:05:57.191
- How did she leave?

674
01:05:57.293 --> 01:05:58.759
You say that she came
here with you in your car.

675
01:05:58.861 --> 01:06:00.729
So did she walk home?

676
01:06:00.831 --> 01:06:03.066
- Yeah. yeah. she walked home.

677
01:06:07.431 --> 01:06:08.897
- Is there someone else here?

678
01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:11.437
- Just Nathan. the young boy
that I brought Elaine to see.

679
01:06:13.538 --> 01:06:15.476
- I think I better
talk to him then.

680
01:06:15.578 --> 01:06:17.608
- Okay.

681
01:06:19.846 --> 01:06:21.882
Nathan?

682
01:06:22.151 --> 01:06:23.817
Nathan. there's a
police officer here.

683
01:06:23.919 --> 01:06:26.155
He'd like to speak to you.

684
01:06:28.792 --> 01:06:31.028
Come in. he's pretty shy.

685
01:07:05.024 --> 01:07:07.056
- Charlie 2480--

686
01:07:22.506 --> 01:07:23.546
- Charlie 2--

687
01:07:47.139 --> 01:07:51.537
- Imagine you'll have to
hit the road again soon.

688
01:07:55.079 --> 01:07:57.312
We just sleep 'til
this is all over.

689
01:07:59.849 --> 01:08:01.877
How long this time?

690
01:08:02.553 --> 01:08:05.287
10. 15?

691
01:08:06.558 --> 01:08:08.587
100 years?

692
01:08:14.593 --> 01:08:17.893
That's all that
hibernation for you.

693
01:08:21.133 --> 01:08:23.371
Go to sleep.

694
01:08:24.676 --> 01:08:26.704
When you wake up.

695
01:08:28.079 --> 01:08:31.280
everyone who's ever
hurt you. dead.

696
01:08:38.119 --> 01:08:40.355
Sure I could do that.

697
01:08:57.042 --> 01:09:00.408
You might like that.
don't you think?

698
01:09:08.887 --> 01:09:10.913
There's another boy like you.

699
01:09:11.954 --> 01:09:14.191
His name was Curtis.

700
01:09:16.554 --> 01:09:18.855
I couldn't save him either.

701
01:09:21.493 --> 01:09:23.728
He died right in front of me.

702
01:09:26.401 --> 01:09:28.634
I tried to keep his
heart beating but

703
01:09:31.008 --> 01:09:33.243
in the end it just stopped.

704
01:09:44.252 --> 01:09:46.118
You best need to get going.

705
01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.456
Police will be here soon.

706
01:09:49.459 --> 01:09:51.954
You're gonna need something
to slide you over.

707
01:09:54.359 --> 01:09:55.891
It must be so hard.

708
01:09:55.993 --> 01:09:58.532
never knowing when you'll
get your next meal.

709
01:10:03.504 --> 01:10:06.771
At least I can do
something. right?
