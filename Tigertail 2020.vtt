She moved here recently.
and it just sort of happened.

Some guys get all the luck.

104

You have a girl like that.
you ask her to marry you.

105
00:10:33.625 --> 00:10:36.416
Her parents would never allow it.
They're well off.

106

I'm a poor kid from a nothing village.

while you can. then.

108

Maybe Faye Dunaway.

122

Never mind. Don't come.

123
00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:58.041

00:53:56.125 --> 00:54:00.833
You wouldn't have to do anything.
You could retire. like we talked about.

533

[Minghua]
<i>[ I don't know anyone there. ]</i>

534
00:54:04.958 --> 00:54:10.375
I didn't either. but you can meet
people once you're here.

[ I don't even speak the language! ]

536
00:54:13.041 --> 00:54:15.291
We talked about this before I left.

537
00:54:15.791 --> 00:54:17.625
I thought this is what you wanted.

538
00:54:17.708 --> 00:54:20.375
[ It's what you wanted.
not what I wanted! ]

539
00:54:21.208 --> 00:54:23.041

Hello?

543
00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:31.000
Hello?

544
00:55:03.416 --> 00:55:04.625
Where were you?

545
00:55:05.583 --> 00:55:07.208
I went to Peijing's for dinner.

546
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:10.875
You didn't tell me.

547
00:55:12.666 --> 00:55:16.333
I thought you'd be at work.
I lost track of time.

548
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:19.333
There was no food in the house.

549
00:55:22.375 --> 00:55:23.291
I'm sorry.

550
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.458
Peijing thinks
if I go to school for just a few years.

551
00:55:32.041 --> 00:55:33.666
I can get a teaching credential.

552
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:35.416
What for?

553
00:55:37.416 --> 00:55:39.375
Then maybe I could become a teacher.

554
00:55:42.666 --> 00:55:43.833
Forget about it.

555
00:55:43.916 --> 00:55:46.625
After we have kids.
you won't have time to work anyway.

556
00:55:49.458 --> 00:55:51.750
Well. we don't have them yet.

557
00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:03.416
Screw him!

558
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:06.708
Just take the classes
and see what happens.

559
00:56:09.083 --> 00:56:11.791
Mmm. I think you're right.

560
00:56:13.625 --> 00:56:16.875
I'll look into when they start.

561
00:56:16.958 --> 00:56:20.833
Good. You won't regret it.

562
00:56:22.125 --> 00:56:24.250
Let's go get ice cream.

563
00:56:24.333 --> 00:56:27.125

Do you want to pack these?

568
00:57:23.916 --> 00:57:25.250
No. You can throw them out.

569
00:57:25.833 --> 00:57:26.708

-Yes.

572
00:58:39.125 --> 00:58:40.416
Is something wrong?

573
00:58:42.833 --> 00:58:44.666
You asked me to have lunch with you.

574
00:58:46.458 --> 00:58:48.166
And I appreciate that.

575
00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:52.291
But then. after we sat down. you just...

576
00:58:52.791 --> 00:58:55.375
sat there for an hour
and barely said anything.

577
00:58:58.666 --> 00:59:00.500
Didn't seem like you wanted to talk.

578
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:09.333
How you doing?

579
00:59:12.875 --> 00:59:14.000
Is everything okay?

580
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.500
[shakily] Yeah. I'm fine.

581
00:59:23.666 --> 00:59:26.125
Actually. that's not true. I'm not fine.

582
00:59:31.416 --> 00:59:32.500
Eric left me.

583
00:59:35.166 --> 00:59:36.791
I don't think he's coming back.

584
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:41.083
I'm sorry.

585
00:59:45.791 --> 00:59:47.541
It's been really hard.

586
00:59:50.583 --> 00:59:52.750
And the worst part is...

587
00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:55.875
I think it was my fault.

588
01:00:07.583 --> 01:00:09.166
Are you gonna say anything?

589
01:00:13.166 --> 01:00:14.583
Sounds difficult.

590
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:21.291
What else is there to say?

591
01:00:23.208 --> 01:00:24.250
I don't know.

592
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:26.250
Something.

593
01:00:28.666 --> 01:00:31.458
Didn't you go through
the same thing with Mom?

594
01:00:34.208 --> 01:00:35.208
It was different.

595
01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:41.041
I wouldn't know
because you never told me what happened.

596
01:00:43.125 --> 01:00:44.333
[Pin-Jui] Would that help?

597
01:00:49.833 --> 01:00:52.208
Why can't you just say something nice?

598
01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:56.416
You could try to make me feel better.

599

You could tell me that
everything's gonna be okay.

600
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.250
All I ever wanted. my whole life...

601
01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.125
was to feel like I had someone

602
01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:12.958
who cared about me.
no matter what happened.

603
01:01:18.625 --> 01:01:20.958
I never got that from you.

604
01:01:28.833 --> 01:01:30.541
You're my father.

605
01:01:31.791 --> 01:01:34.500
I don't even know how to talk to you.
I never have.

606
01:01:42.541 --> 01:01:45.083
Maybe it's easier if we just stop trying.

What happened to the hedges out front?

611
01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:30.541
I told the gardeners they could trim them.

612
01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:32.416
Why did you do that?

613
01:02:33.125 --> 01:02:34.375
They trimmed too much.

614
01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:38.958
You weren't here.
I didn't know what you wanted.

615

Hey.
They'll take forever to grow back now.

What?

I want a divorce.

No. you don't.

-I don't care about your stupid house.

Nice clothes. a nice car.

That's not how we do things.

Don't forget.
I was the one who brought you here.

635
01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:54.208
My dad paid for it.

636
01:03:54.791 --> 01:03:56.666
You had nothing.

637
01:03:56.750 --> 01:04:00.250
Yes. I came here with nothing.

638
01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:02.958
And I built all of this myself.
while you stayed at home.

639
01:04:03.041 --> 01:04:06.958
I raised our children
while you were never home.

640

Where were you all those nights? Where?

641
01:04:10.916 --> 01:04:12.625
I never cheated on you.

642
01:04:18.875 --> 01:04:19.833
It doesn't matter.

643
01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:25.375
You take me for granted.

644
01:04:26.125 --> 01:04:28.833

Go.

I used to think you could learn to care
about anyone other than yourself.

648
01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:57.541
But you can't.

649
01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:00.958
And you never will.

650
01:05:03.458 --> 01:05:05.458

01:12:14.083 --> 01:12:15.083
That's nice.

711
01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:20.041
-And you?
-Hmm?

712
01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:21.166
How are your kids?

713
01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:24.833
Good. Bobby has a band
that's done very well.

714
01:12:25.416 --> 01:12:27.541
He just got back from a tour in Europe.

715
01:12:29.208 --> 01:12:30.250
What about Angela?

716
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.833
She's having a harder time.

717
01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:35.750
She works too much.

718
01:12:36.875 --> 01:12:38.250
She has trouble getting along with people.

719
01:12:39.583 --> 01:12:42.916
I don't know how to talk to her.

720
01:12:44.458 --> 01:12:45.583
She's very stubborn.

721
01:12:48.708 --> 01:12:50.750
You should know something about that.

722
01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:55.541
Maybe before she opens up.
she needs you to open up to her first.

723
01:12:55.625 --> 01:12:57.125
It's never too late.

724
01:13:00.416 --> 01:13:01.250
Mmm.

725
01:13:03.416 --> 01:13:06.458
This was fun. Thank you for lunch.

726
01:13:06.541 --> 01:13:09.666
You're welcome. It was good to see you.

727
01:13:14.875 --> 01:13:17.125

731
01:15:09.833 --> 01:15:11.125
[in English] Hi. everybody.

732
01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:14.333
I just wanted to say a little something.

733
01:15:15.833 --> 01:15:19.208
As you know.
this hasn't been the easiest year for me.

734
01:15:19.291 --> 01:15:21.458
but it really means a lot
to see all your faces again.

735
01:15:21.541 --> 01:15:25.166
and be able to celebrate together.
Thank you so much for coming.

736
01:15:26.333 --> 01:15:27.833
Happy Chinese New Year.

737
01:15:27.916 --> 01:15:29.708
[all] Happy New Year.

[imperceptible]

739
01:15:44.375 --> 01:15:47.208
Do you want anything else to drink? Wine?

740
01:15:49.958 --> 01:15:52.250
No. Tea's fine.

741
01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:54.916
Okay.

742
01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:07.958
-Here you go. Of course.
-[man] Thank you.

743
01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:10.666
I'm so glad you guys
could make it out here for the party.

744
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:12.666
You should visit more often.

745
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:16.208
It's hard for me to miss work.
My students miss me! [chuckles]

746
01:16:16.291 --> 01:16:18.333
I substitute for her sometimes.

747
01:16:18.416 --> 01:16:20.500
They love her.
They think she's very funny.

748
01:16:21.125 --> 01:16:24.291
I'm sure they do.
Are you guys traveling anywhere this year?

749
01:16:24.375 --> 01:16:27.166
For spring break.
we're gonna go to Costa Rica

750
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:30.666
and then. in the summer.
we go back to Croatia.

751
01:16:31.208 --> 01:16:33.333
Wow! That sounds really fun.

752
01:16:33.416 --> 01:16:35.041
-Yeah.
-We can't wait.

[footsteps approaching]

755
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.208
I thought you'd left.

756
01:17:02.666 --> 01:17:03.500
No.

757
01:17:14.791 --> 01:17:16.708
You don't have to help. I got it.

758
01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:21.000
It's okay.

759
01:17:53.666 --> 01:17:54.500
Thanks.

760
01:17:58.416 --> 01:17:59.500
I can do the rest.

761
01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:03.208
Why don't you go to the dining room?
I'll make us some tea.

762
01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:07.166
Okay.

763
01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:49.625
Mom seems happy.

764
01:18:52.333 --> 01:18:53.500
I'm glad for her.

765
01:18:58.750 --> 01:19:01.791
This is the first time
I've hosted this party by myself.

766
01:19:03.208 --> 01:19:04.333
without Eric.

767
01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:11.958
Sometimes. I wonder
if I'll ever find anyone like him again.

768
01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:15.833
When we were together...

769
01:19:18.166 --> 01:19:19.916
it just felt different.

770
01:19:22.208 --> 01:19:23.416
Do you know what I mean?

771
01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:31.291
[exhales]

772
01:19:34.791 --> 01:19:36.375
There was a woman once.

773
01:19:38.125 --> 01:19:40.166
I knew her before your mother.

774
01:19:42.666 --> 01:19:43.791
In Taiwan.

775
01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:48.708
I didn't know that.

776
01:19:51.583 --> 01:19:54.208
There are many things I never told you.

777
01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:07.166
What did you do after Mom left?

778
01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:12.916
I went home.

785
01:22:49.125 --> 01:22:50.208
<i>Like you.</i>

786
01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:02.916

01:23:22.375 --> 01:23:24.333
This was our house.

789
01:23:35.166 --> 01:23:37.791
It didn't look like this
the last time I was here.

790
01:23:47.666 --> 01:23:49.458
There was a bar down there.

791
01:23:51.208 --> 01:23:55.333
The girl and I used to go there to dance.

792
01:24:00.541 --> 01:24:02.375
What was her name?

793
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:09.916
