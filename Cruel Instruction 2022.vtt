5
00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:37.986
They're going to kill her
in here.

6
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.288
She's going to die.

7
00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.623
Get this door open! We have
to stop her right now!

8
00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:53.260
Okay. flash cards away.
Quiz time.

9
00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.888
As soon as you are finished.
you can go.

[bell rings]

11
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.073
Hey. Good Will.

12
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.575
Who died so you could have
those clothes?

13
00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.994
Look at her. she dresses
like my dad.

14
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.122
We didn't say you could go.

15
00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:04.498
I've got Bio.

16
00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:06.792
As if. You're dumb as dog shit.
everyone knows that.

17
00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:15.175
-Come back here!
-Don't let her get away!

18
00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.223
-Going somewhere?
-Nowhere to run.

19
00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:23.725
What now?

20
00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:27.354
[alarm wailing]

21
00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:31.316
In the woods we return
to reason and faith.

22
00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:33.435
You do not drown by falling
in the water.

23
00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:35.654
you drown by staying there.

24
00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:38.448
Let's move it. Scheff.

25
00:02:38.576 --> 00:02:40.784
I gotta go... number two.

26
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:42.619
We just took a bathroom break.

27
00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:45.581
You gotta let me poop.
It's in the rules.

28
00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.292
Fine.

29
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.214
Over there is good.

30
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.471
You've got three minutes.

31
00:03:08.564 --> 00:03:10.606
You mind?

32
00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:38.383
That's your third flight
attempt. Scheff.

33
00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:39.593
[laughs]

34
00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.011
You know what that means.

35
00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:43.338
Sorry. Steven. You're gonna have
to come get me.

36
00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:44.890

00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:56.443
[police radio chatter]

38
00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:01.573
Thank you for bringing
her home. Officer.

39
00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.533
This won't happen again.
I promise.

40
00:04:12.628 --> 00:04:14.378
You broke the law today.

41
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:16.871
I told you... I didn't have
a choice.

42
00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:18.757
They're just silly boys.
Kayla.

43
00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.592
We've talked about this.

44
00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:25.264
Mom. I told you... ignoring
them doesn't work.

45
00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.932
Well. then we're going
to have to figure this out

46
00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:31.019
because this behavior of yours
is completely unacceptable.

47
00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:33.230
I'm not just talking
about today.

48
00:04:33.357 --> 00:04:34.556
You've been failing
all of your classes

49
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.108
since the start of
the school year.

50
00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:37.484
You're not studying.

51
00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.894
You blow off the tutor
your mother and I paid for.

52
00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:41.738
Honey. just talk to us.
please.

53
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.157
I've tried talking to you
but you don't listen.

54
00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:48.287
I just...

55
00:04:48.372 --> 00:04:51.248
I feel so alone.

56
00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:53.575
No one likes me.

57
00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.413
And I get this tightness
in my chest all the time

58
00:04:58.507 --> 00:05:00.081
and it just doesn't go away.

59
00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.416
And I can't sleep.

60
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.011
And then sometimes I just.
I feel like I can't.

61
00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:05.637
I can't breathe.

62
00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:10.183
And I just... I want to be
someone else.

63
00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:12.427
Kayla. you're not stupid.

64
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.563
You just need to try hard
and apply yourself.

65
00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:17.265
Then you can be anybody
you want to be.

66
00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.442
Yeah? Ray?

67
00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:19.484
Like you?

68
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.102
I should just hide
in my homework

69
00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:22.821
and not feel anything. ever?

70
00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.324
Alright. That's enough.
Go to your room.

71
00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:26.700
Go on!

72
00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:27.942
Ray...

73
00:05:28.037 --> 00:05:29.328
No. no. no. I'm not going
to have this.

74
00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:31.038
we don't talk like this
in my own house.

75
00:05:31.123 --> 00:05:32.706
Go on!

76
00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.875
Go. Now.

77
00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:39.588
She used to be so happy.

78
00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:40.955
I just don't understand...

79
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.132
-I know. I know.
-what's. what's happened to her.

80
00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:43.050
It's alright.

81
00:05:44.428 --> 00:05:49.097
Can I get some O.J.?
I know I'm allowed juice!

82
00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:50.640
[buzzer]

83
00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.907
Does my mom know
I'm here?

84
00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:08.817
She does.

85
00:06:08.911 --> 00:06:10.327
She ask to talk to me?

86
00:06:10.454 --> 00:06:12.704
I'm sorry Amanda.
she didn't.

87
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.997
What else is new?

88
00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.749
I'm here to walk you through
your options

89
00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.501
and talk about what's next.

90
00:06:17.628 --> 00:06:18.919
Let me guess.

91
00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:23.382
I get my choice between
wilderness adventure in Montana.

92
00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:25.133
therapy camp in Georgia...

93
00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:28.345
Actually. there really isn't
a choice at this point.

94
00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:32.432
There's a treatment facility
in Utah for girls like you.

95
00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:36.353
It's either that or
juvenile detention.

96
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.513
This is what the judge
on your case has ordered

97
00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:41.024
and your mom has signed off.

98
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:45.070
Girls like me. huh?

99
00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.613
You think you know me?

100
00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.532
I don't know you. Amanda.

101
00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:51.192
All I know is what's
in your file.

102
00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:54.871
You've been in and out of
therapy since you were eight.

103
00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.124
It's your fourth time
in a psych ward.

104
00:06:57.209 --> 00:07:00.585
You've been diagnosed
with Bipolar II. ADHD...

105
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:02.871
Yeah. and my dad split
when I was born

106
00:07:02.965 --> 00:07:05.465
and my mom's a lying.
manipulative piece of work

107
00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:09.210
and blah. blah. blah...
guess I'm just certifiable.

108
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.763
Not worth saving.

109
00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:13.515
Lock me up in another one
of these schools

110
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.717
and throw away the key.
Right?

111
00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:16.852
Look...

112
00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:23.391
I know these places
are rough.

113
00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:26.561
I know the things they make
you do.

114
00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:30.157
And if you were my daughter.
I would never send you there.

115
00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.237
Can't you do something?

116
00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:40.000
I wish I could.
It's out of my hands.

117
00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:41.960
Let me give you some advice.

118
00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.921
No matter how bad it gets.

119
00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:51.920
never forget that you are free
up here.

120
00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:57.058
No one can take away
your freedom of the mind.

121
00:07:57.144 --> 00:08:01.095
Utah's your last stop so just
keep your head down.

122
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.606
stay out of trouble.

123
00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:04.816
Just get to your 18.

124
00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:09.696
'cause once you're 18 you can go
wherever you want.

125
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.657
You can do whatever you want

126
00:08:12.743 --> 00:08:15.952
and you can figure out
what kind of help you need.

127
00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.997
To be the person
that you want to be.

128
00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.208
You understand
what I'm saying?

129
00:08:21.293 --> 00:08:22.834
Yeah.

130
00:08:24.296 --> 00:08:26.120
I know we all just want
the best for Kayla.

131
00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:28.340
Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.467
You know. but unfortunately
this is her second suspension

133
00:08:30.594 --> 00:08:33.294
so we can't welcome her
back at school

134
00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:35.430
without additional treatment.

135
00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:38.183
Additional treatments?
Like what?

136
00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:39.801
I'd like to bring in

137
00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:43.522
our outside educational
consultant. Mr. Davis
to join us.

138
00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:51.196
Mr. and Mrs. Adams. hello.

139
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:52.480
Hi.

140
00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:54.699
I've been looking through
Kayla's file

141
00:08:54.785 --> 00:08:57.661
and it's clear to me
that she's a good kid.

142
00:08:57.788 --> 00:08:59.871
Mm-hmm. she's a good kid.
She's great.

143
00:08:59.957 --> 00:09:01.456
I'm going to list
some behaviors

144
00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:05.835
and I want you to tell me if any
of them sound familiar. Okay?

145
00:09:05.963 --> 00:09:09.130
Difficulty focusing on tasks.
like schoolwork.

146
00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:11.675
Low self-esteem.
Low motivation.

147
00:09:11.802 --> 00:09:14.261
Mood swings.
Oversleeping.

148
00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.513
Slow development
of social skills.

149
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.506
Outbursts of anger.

150
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.059
You just described Kayla to a T.

151
00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:22.519
Have you ever heard of

152
00:09:22.646 --> 00:09:24.854
residential behavioral
health centers?

153
00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:26.022
Is that like a hospital?

154
00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:27.682
Oh. no. no. no.
nothing like that.

155
00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:30.360
It's a school with a whole lot
of added help

156
00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:32.687
for teens like Kayla
who are struggling

157
00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:35.356
with this difficult time
of transition.

158
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.534
They offer a change
of environment.

159
00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:39.911
Get kids into a new
and dynamic setting

160
00:09:39.997 --> 00:09:41.997
to practice their coping skills.

161
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:45.867
They. they also provide one
on one and group therapy

162
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.920
with trained and
board-certified professionals.

163
00:09:49.006 --> 00:09:50.872
Kayla would be surrounded
by girls

164
00:09:50.966 --> 00:09:54.092
who are all working through
the same issues as she is.

165
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:57.387
And the best part is
they're all in it together.

166
00:09:57.514 --> 00:10:00.056
I have to admit. seems like
this would help Kayla

167
00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:03.051
get back on track. but
this doesn't seem cheap.

168
00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:05.020
There's no need to worry
about that. Mr. Adams.

169
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.230
I've taken the liberty of
checking with your insurance

170
00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:10.609
and the... the expense
is fully covered.

171
00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:21.903
How many times
I gotta tell you?

172
00:10:21.997 --> 00:10:24.998
Use a goddamn cup
like a normal person.

173
00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:30.420
When's Amanda coming home?

174
00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.339
She's going to Utah.

175
00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:34.090
What's in Utah?

176
00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.719
Her last chance.

177
00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:46.019
[notification alert]

178
00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:48.146
Oh. shit!

179

A special school.

183

What the hell?

184
00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:13.797
You changed my school
and you didn't even tell me?

185
00:11:13.924 --> 00:11:15.965
We're telling you now.

186
00:11:17.094 --> 00:11:18.218

187
00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.636

version of yourself.

194
00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.533

Thank you. Trent.

234
00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:40.568
Oh. honey. There's nothing
to worry about.

235
00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:42.195
You're going to be in and out
in no time

236
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.531

right here for you.

237
00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:46.825
-Okay.
-Okay.

238

Welcome to Appaloosa.

239
00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:56.709
Clothes off.

240
00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:04.259
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

241
00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.219
Clothes off. now.

242
00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:26.981
For you.

243
00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:29.158
And you.

244
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.621
And just over here.
you're first.

245
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:45.633
[urinating]

246
00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:50.013
Thank you.

247
00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.812
Adams. this way.

248
00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:11.326
[urinating]

249
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.996
Thank you.

250
00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:23.421
Great.

251
00:15:24.633 --> 00:15:27.008
Adams. you'll be up first.

252
00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:32.513
Okay.

253
00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.019
Get your heels there.

254
00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.898
And. uh. scooch forward.

255
00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:43.724
Just move your butt forward
as far as possible.

256
00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.059
Good. good. good.

257
00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.061
I've never done this before.

258
00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:48.571
It's standard procedure.
Come on.

259
00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.898
But I'm 15. Do I have to?

260
00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:53.201
Girls like you try and smuggle
in all kinds of things.

261
00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:54.735
I've seen it all.

262
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.329
Come on.

263
00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:00.541
Let's just get your
underwear there.

264
00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:05.713
Okay. I'll put those there.

265
00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:06.914
Good.

266
00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.508
So now you're going to feel
some pressure

267
00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:10.635
and it's going to feel cold.

268
00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.768
Hymen's still intact.

269
00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:20.728
Good girl.

270
00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.942
Don't let them see you cry.

271
00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.080
Ugh. it's the worst. I know.

272
00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:44.002
But it's over now so let me
show you around.

273
00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:46.546
Over here is our
pill dispensary.

274
00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:49.215
You'll be visiting that
at least once a day.

275
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.011
And then over here
we have the cafeteria

276
00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:56.305
which will be serving up
some very delicious food.

277
00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:59.058
And in here you'll have
your group therapy.

278
00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:00.968
twice a week.
with your unit.

279
00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:02.145
We have four units here.

280
00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:04.230
There's two upstairs.
there's two downstairs.

281
00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:07.859
But you will only have therapy
with your own.

282
00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:12.196
Speaking of...
this is Unit 2.

283
00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:15.533
Everybody please welcome
our two new members.

284
00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:18.494
Kayla Adams and Amanda Scheff.

285
00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.041
I said. say hello.

286
00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:25.543
All: Hi Kayla and Amanda.

287
00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.128
You'll be getting
your meds later.

288
00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:30.381
just helps you sleep a little
better after your long travels.

289
00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.050
Miss Harris?

290
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.344
You didn't take your meds.

291
00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:38.172
I'm not going to take
your stupid pills!

292
00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:39.340
Dial nine.

293
00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:40.391
No. I'll take the meds.
I'll take the meds.

294
00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:42.935
Girls stand up.
Turn around!

295
00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:45.346
-It's too late.
-Face the walls.

296
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.148
No. no. I'll take the pills!

297
00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.316
It's too late.

298
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.651
I'll take the pills.
I'll take the pills.

299
00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:51.694
[thud]

300
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:02.872
Dibs!

301
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.706
This door stays open
at all times. Understood?

302
00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:17.053
-What. even at night?
-Especially at night.

303
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.388
Okay. phones please.

304
00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:28.481
If you have music downloaded
you can still listen.

305
00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.691
Before bed only.

306
00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:38.533
[sighs]

307
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:45.906
First day's always rough.

308
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.908
Did you hear that girl's head?

309
00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:49.252
Like when it. when it
hit the ground?

310
00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:50.419
You gotta forget it.

311
00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:52.380
But what if she's. like.
seriously hurt?

312
00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.842
You can't think about anybody
but yourself in here.

313
00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:58.094
I do not think I'm supposed
to be here.

314
00:18:58.221 --> 00:18:59.762
My parents they thought
that they were sending me

315
00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.140
someplace different.

316
00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:03.141
Yeah. no shit.

317
00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:04.142
The parents never know
the truth.

318
00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:05.268
that's the whole point.

319
00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:08.146
You don't get it.
I can't stay here.

320
00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:12.316
No. Kayla.

321
00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:14.026
You don't get it.

322
00:19:14.112 --> 00:19:15.194
[knocks]

323
00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:19.157
Dinner! You can
settle in afterwards.

324
00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:25.246
Um... may I please speak
to my parents?

325
00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:26.998
Oh. honey. I'm afraid not.

326
00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:30.451
Phone privileges must be earned
and we really encourage

327
00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:34.288
all newcomers to have no outside
contact for at least a week.

328
00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:37.592
It's for your own benefit.
just helps you get acclimated

329
00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:41.053
without all of
the outside noise.

330
00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:45.349
But I can assure you that
your parents have been updated

331
00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:48.636
and all is well.

332
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.229
It's urgent.

333
00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:52.982
There's been. uh...
a mistake.

334
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.319
A mistake?

335
00:19:56.446 --> 00:20:01.282
I'm serious. I need
to call them.

336
00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:04.535
Why don't we have a seat
and have a little chat. Hmm?

337
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.542
In here. Kayla Adams. I'm your
mommy and your daddy

338
00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:14.161
and this is my house.

339
00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:19.333
And rule number one in my house
is no talking back. ever.

340
00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:20.718
Understood?

341
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.849
I asked you a question.

342
00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:45.034
No talking and no moving
until I say so.

343
00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:48.412
And every time you push back.
that will be another week

344
00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.197
without phone privileges.

345
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.699
And if this still continues.

346
00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.876
you will find yourself
in Investment.

347
00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:56.879
Is that understood?

348
00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:02.969
Dinner time!
Line structure.

349
00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:07.139
Arm's length apart.

350
00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:09.558
Dawn. take your hands
out of the pocket.

351
00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:11.519
[coughing]

352
00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:15.606
You need to ask my permission
every time you scratch your nose

353
00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:16.732
or you burp.

354
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.402
Do you got that?

355
00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:23.447
Why don't we tell Amanda
our five free phrases.

356
00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:24.907
Girls: Thank you. Sorry.

357
00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:28.119
Excuse me. You're welcome.
Bless you.

358
00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:29.161
Very good.

359
00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:32.206
Okay. Taco night!

360
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.254
Be glad you're missing
taco night.

361
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:41.090
I'll see you around hopefully.

362
00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:54.020
Miss Connie?

363
00:21:54.105 --> 00:21:56.147
Yes?

364
00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:59.483
Uh... you came down hard
on the new girls.

365
00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:02.445
Well. I find that it's best
to scare them

366
00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:04.271
right in the beginning.

367
00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:08.617
Then they fall in line quicker
and they learn to listen.

368
00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:12.997
Uh. yeah... Adams
is in shock though.

369
00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:15.666
What is our job here.
remember?

370
00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:16.784
To teach them discipline.

371
00:22:16.878 --> 00:22:18.786
No elbows on the tables.

372
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.046
Because?

373
00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:21.505
Discipline in here equals
success out there.

374
00:22:21.591 --> 00:22:22.956
That's exactly right.

375
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:25.092
What we're doing
is helping them.

376
00:22:25.178 --> 00:22:27.136
We are giving them the tough
love that they needed

377
00:22:27.263 --> 00:22:29.180
and they never got at home.

378
00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:32.058
Adams is going to be just fine.

379
00:22:32.143 --> 00:22:33.851
Okay.

380
00:22:40.234 --> 00:22:42.068
Under your pillow.

381
00:22:43.404 --> 00:22:45.154
It's all I could sneak out.

382
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:46.989
Thanks.

383
00:22:48.493 --> 00:22:50.818
You gotta drop
the parents thing.

384
00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:52.745
Trust me.

385
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.823
You've been in a place
like this?

386
00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:56.916
Four?

387
00:22:57.001 --> 00:22:59.543
I just loved the first three
so much.

388
00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:05.666
You think I'm crazy now. huh?

389
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.842
I didn't say that.

390
00:23:06.969 --> 00:23:08.886
You didn't have to.

391
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:12.431
Gonna want to work on
your poker face in here. rookie.

392
00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:18.020
Well?

393
00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:21.014
Are you?

394
00:23:21.109 --> 00:23:24.276
Crazy?

395
00:23:24.362 --> 00:23:28.072
In a place like this
nobody's a perfect angel.

396
00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:31.367
Not even you.

397
00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:33.369
That's not what I meant.

398
00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:38.040
[sighs]

399
00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:41.419
My mom had me real young.

400
00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:42.795
Not that much older
than we are now

401
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.213
and it just messed everything
up for her.

402
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.548
My dad split when I was born.

403
00:23:45.675 --> 00:23:48.384
leaving just me there
to soak up all her anger.

404
00:23:48.511 --> 00:23:49.760
She's hated me my whole life.

405
00:23:49.846 --> 00:23:52.880
She lies about me. says
I did things I didn't do.

406
00:23:52.974 --> 00:23:54.882
I think she just wanted people
to feel sorry for her

407
00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:58.602
for having such
a screwed up kid.

408
00:23:58.688 --> 00:23:59.770
Jeez.

409
00:23:59.856 --> 00:24:01.889
That's awful. I'm... I'm sorry.

410
00:24:01.983 --> 00:24:02.890
Don't get me wrong.

411
00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:04.400
I've done some really
stupid shit.

412
00:24:04.527 --> 00:24:07.278
My brain's definitely
not normal. you know?

413
00:24:07.363 --> 00:24:08.779
I've got anger issues.

414
00:24:08.865 --> 00:24:10.406
Big time mood swings.

415
00:24:10.533 --> 00:24:13.784
But. like. I can't remember
who I was when I was little.

416
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.569
It's like the chicken
or the egg thing.

417
00:24:15.663 --> 00:24:16.996
Was I messed up
before these places

418
00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:20.207
or did these places
mess me up?

419
00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:23.127
I can't even tell anymore.

420
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:26.005
How do you know
all of that?

421
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.591
A lot of therapy.

422
00:24:28.718 --> 00:24:30.551
If my mom knew that I was
in a place like this

423
00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:33.420
she'd come and take me home
in a minute.

424
00:24:33.514 --> 00:24:34.430
Yeah?

425
00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:36.474
You sure about that?

426
00:24:37.602 --> 00:24:40.478
First centre I was at they
woke me up at 3:00A.M.

427
00:24:40.563 --> 00:24:42.104
Dragged me out of bed.
screaming.

428
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:45.149
I thought I was being kidnapped
until I saw Mommy there.

429
00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:47.526
just watching it all.

430
00:24:53.534 --> 00:24:57.778
Hey... you've gotta find
something to focus on.

431
00:24:57.872 --> 00:25:00.113
Your guiding star.

432
00:25:00.208 --> 00:25:02.249
For me it's 18.

433
00:25:02.335 --> 00:25:04.502
When I turn 18.
I'm outta here.

434
00:25:04.587 --> 00:25:09.465
I can go anywhere. be anything.
and nobody can stop me.

435
00:25:09.592 --> 00:25:11.800
Ten months and I'm free.

436
00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:17.389
What's your star?

437
00:25:22.146 --> 00:25:24.355
I don't know.

438
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.190
Better find one.

439
00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:29.142
Otherwise this place
will chew you up.

440
00:25:29.237 --> 00:25:31.028
Or just fake it
'til you make it.

441
00:25:31.113 --> 00:25:32.863
Voice: Shut down!

442
00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:38.994
What's this Investment place?

443
00:25:39.121 --> 00:25:40.746
You gotta listen better.

444
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:43.165
Listen?

445
00:25:43.292 --> 00:25:44.542
We're not even allowed to talk.

446
00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:46.085
Oh. there's talking.

447
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.629
You just gotta be all ears.

448
00:25:48.714 --> 00:25:50.998
The Investment Unit
sounds like solitary.

449
00:25:51.092 --> 00:25:52.332
They keep you alone
in a classroom

450
00:25:52.426 --> 00:25:53.759
doing homework for days.

451
00:25:53.844 --> 00:25:55.553
It's not too bad.

452
00:25:55.638 --> 00:25:59.223
Obs is what you want to avoid.

453
00:25:59.308 --> 00:26:00.099
Obs?

454
00:26:00.184 --> 00:26:01.433
Observation room.

455
00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:03.769
I heard the girls talking
about it at dinner.

456
00:26:03.854 --> 00:26:05.512
Like a cinder block cell.

457
00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:08.691
They throw you in there.
maybe with clothes.

458
00:26:08.818 --> 00:26:10.734
maybe without.

459
00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:11.852
Yeah.

460
00:26:11.946 --> 00:26:14.655
Our very own Guantanamo. baby.

461
00:26:15.658 --> 00:26:17.616
'Night.

462
00:26:37.513 --> 00:26:40.097
I like where you're going
with this. Kayla.

463
00:26:40.182 --> 00:26:42.349
Let's talk after class.
okay?

464
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.896
[bell rings]

465
00:26:48.024 --> 00:26:50.524
Remember. reports due Friday!

466
00:27:02.872 --> 00:27:04.079
Kayla...

467
00:27:04.206 --> 00:27:06.874
So how are you doing?
Overall.

468
00:27:09.378 --> 00:27:12.087
I know it can be
a hard adjustment.

469
00:27:12.214 --> 00:27:14.247
Lots of rules.

470
00:27:14.342 --> 00:27:16.416
But you'll get used to it.

471
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.584
I hope so.

472
00:27:17.678 --> 00:27:19.428
You're a smart girl.

473
00:27:19.555 --> 00:27:22.589
Has anybody ever talked to you
about dyslexia?

474
00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:24.725
Do you know the term?

475
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.061
It's a learning disability

476
00:27:27.146 --> 00:27:29.730
that has absolutely nothing
to do with intelligence.

477
00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:33.767
It can just. you know.
mix up some of the letters.

478
00:27:33.861 --> 00:27:35.611
Switch them around.

479
00:27:35.738 --> 00:27:39.198
It makes it harder to. uh.
read or spell.

480
00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:44.111
Even though you know exactly
what you want to say.

481
00:27:44.205 --> 00:27:45.454
I thought I was just stupid.

482
00:27:45.581 --> 00:27:47.748
No. you are definitely
not stupid.

483
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.282
Do me a favor.

484
00:27:49.377 --> 00:27:51.251
Take a look at the board real
quick and then back at me.

485
00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:56.840
Can you tell me what
word's on top?

486
00:27:56.926 --> 00:27:58.717
Cat or cot?

487
00:28:05.643 --> 00:28:07.810
Alright. it's okay.
It's alright.

488
00:28:07.937 --> 00:28:11.972
Next week we will do the full
test and then go from there.

489
00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:13.107
Okay?

490
00:28:15.778 --> 00:28:17.194
Thank you.

491
00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.478
Good.

492
00:28:18.572 --> 00:28:22.282
Um. sir. can I ask you
a question?

493
00:28:22.368 --> 00:28:24.076
Yeah.

494
00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:27.487
Um. do you know about
this place?

495
00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:29.915
I'm not sure I know
what you mean.

496
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.500
Like how they treat us.

497
00:28:31.627 --> 00:28:33.001
My first day I saw a girl
get tackled-

498
00:28:33.129 --> 00:28:36.046
Kayla. it's not my job
to supervise

499
00:28:36.132 --> 00:28:38.665
anything outside this classroom.

500
00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:40.000
But don't you care-

501
00:28:40.094 --> 00:28:41.677
I do know that there's likely
a very good reason

502
00:28:41.804 --> 00:28:43.679
why you're here.

503
00:28:44.807 --> 00:28:46.557
You want my advice?

504
00:28:49.812 --> 00:28:52.354
Just keep your nose clean
and do as you're told.

505
00:28:52.481 --> 00:28:55.182
Now. I need to get back
to grading

506
00:28:55.276 --> 00:28:57.359
and you should get to class.

507
00:28:59.655 --> 00:29:02.865
Bryce: Nevertheless.
because those miracles

508
00:29:02.992 --> 00:29:05.451
were worked by small means.

509
00:29:05.536 --> 00:29:09.997
It did show unto them
marvelous works.

510
00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:14.126
The show of their countenance
doth witness against them

511
00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:18.464
and doth declare their sin
to be even as sodden

512
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:20.299
And they cannot hide it.

513
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:25.804
Thank you. Bryce. Okay. girls.
time for achievements.

514
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:30.434
Anderson. Perez.
Lewis and Garcia.

515
00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:33.020
TV privileges next week.

516
00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:35.230
Torres and Green.

517
00:29:35.357 --> 00:29:37.775
You get to go to the library.

518
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.361
Uh. Scheff... you get
a phone call.

519
00:29:41.447 --> 00:29:45.157
And Adams. let's see here...
hmm.

520
00:29:45.242 --> 00:29:49.745
Looks like Adams was
spreading lies and negativity

521
00:29:49.872 --> 00:29:51.246
as she was making up stories

522
00:29:51.373 --> 00:29:53.332
that she told her teacher
during class.

523
00:29:53.417 --> 00:29:54.458
What? No. I...

524
00:29:54.543 --> 00:29:56.960
And as a result.

525
00:29:57.046 --> 00:30:00.714
I'm sorry. but there are no
phone privileges for a month.

526
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.090
That's not fair.

527
00:30:02.218 --> 00:30:04.968
Everything that is concealed
will be brought to light

528
00:30:05.054 --> 00:30:06.428
and made known to all.

529
00:30:06.555 --> 00:30:10.265
You know. you are
a very lucky girl.

530
00:30:10.392 --> 00:30:12.851
I happen to be in a fantastic
mood this week.

531
00:30:12.937 --> 00:30:16.313
Otherwise. the consequences
for what you did would be

532
00:30:16.398 --> 00:30:19.608
a week on the Investment Unit.
Isn't that right. girls?

533
00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:20.818
All: Yes. Miss Connie.

534
00:30:20.903 --> 00:30:23.654
And for upholding
the rules here.

535
00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:27.366
Fry has earned herself a trip
to the drive-thru.

536
00:30:27.451 --> 00:30:29.609
Isn't that great?

537
00:30:29.703 --> 00:30:31.203
Snitch.

538
00:30:32.248 --> 00:30:34.039
What did you call me?

539
00:30:34.124 --> 00:30:36.333
Get up. Say it again
to my face!

540
00:30:36.418 --> 00:30:37.668
-Hey!
-Do it again. I dare you!

541
00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:38.794
Hey.

542
00:30:39.463 --> 00:30:40.954
[gasps]

543
00:30:41.757 --> 00:30:43.790
Miss Connie. don't dial nine!
I lost my head.

544
00:30:43.884 --> 00:30:45.592
I promise I won't do it again.

545
00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:50.556
And what do you think would be
an appropriate consequence

546
00:30:50.641 --> 00:30:52.391
for that behavior?

547
00:30:52.476 --> 00:30:54.226
No drive-thru.

548
00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:55.519
And?

549
00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:57.104
Investment.

550
00:30:57.189 --> 00:30:59.356
For how long?

551
00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:00.983
Three days.

552
00:31:02.736 --> 00:31:04.820
A week.

553
00:31:04.947 --> 00:31:06.238
Go.

554
00:31:06.323 --> 00:31:07.781
Now!

555
00:31:11.245 --> 00:31:12.819
Stand up.

556
00:31:12.913 --> 00:31:16.823
I know you started this and
I'm not going to forget that.

557
00:31:16.917 --> 00:31:18.709
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

558
00:31:18.794 --> 00:31:21.661
You know you are
a very nasty girl

559
00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:25.382
who thinks you're smarter
than everybody else.

560
00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:27.384
No. I'm not.

561
00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:29.928
Well. it's true.
That's why you're here.

562
00:31:30.014 --> 00:31:31.221
That's why your mom
sent you here

563
00:31:31.307 --> 00:31:35.508
because she knows
who you are.

564
00:31:35.603 --> 00:31:38.937
So. I'd like to hear you say it.

565
00:31:39.023 --> 00:31:41.773
I'm a nasty girl and
I deserve to be here.

566
00:31:41.859 --> 00:31:43.516
Louder.

567
00:31:43.611 --> 00:31:46.653
I'm a nasty girl and I
deserve to be here.

568
00:31:46.739 --> 00:31:48.780
Again.

569
00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:52.451
I'm a nasty girl and I
deserve to be here.

570
00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:02.586
All the days just
blur together here.

571
00:32:02.671 --> 00:32:04.922
It's freaky.

572
00:32:05.007 --> 00:32:07.040
I don't even know how long
we've been here.

573
00:32:07.134 --> 00:32:08.091
We've been here
for three months.

574
00:32:08.177 --> 00:32:10.010
one week and two days.

575
00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:17.726
How do you know all of that?

576
00:32:17.853 --> 00:32:19.144
Gotta pay attention.
Adams.

577
00:32:19.229 --> 00:32:21.772
They want you to get
used to this.

578
00:32:21.857 --> 00:32:24.274
My guiding star. Remember?

579
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.403
I turn 18 in six months.
three weeks and five days.

580
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:30.238
That's why I count.

581
00:32:33.535 --> 00:32:36.078
I just don't have
a guiding star.

582
00:32:36.205 --> 00:32:39.790
Well. stop moping around.
Maybe you'll find it.

583
00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:48.757
Miss Torres.

584
00:32:54.223 --> 00:32:55.806
Good.

585
00:32:57.393 --> 00:33:00.060
Ah. Miss Scheff.
Welcome.

586
00:33:02.356 --> 00:33:03.480
Okay.

587
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.775
Okay.

588
00:33:06.902 --> 00:33:09.778
Harris. It's your turn to share.

589
00:33:21.125 --> 00:33:23.750
My older brother.
Andrew. he...

590
00:33:23.836 --> 00:33:28.380
Louder please.
We can't hear you.

591
00:33:30.884 --> 00:33:36.805
My brother. Andrew.
has this friend. Kevin.

592
00:33:36.932 --> 00:33:41.852
and Kevin used to come over
every day after school

593
00:33:41.937 --> 00:33:45.689
to play video games.

594
00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:47.399
I would make them
bagel bites sometimes

595
00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:49.443
when they would get hungry.

596
00:33:54.450 --> 00:34:00.245
One time. um. I went in the
kitchen and Kevin followed me.

597
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.205
Andrew was in the bathroom
or something. I don't know.

598
00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:10.213
But Kevin was there and he...
pulled down my shorts and...

599
00:34:13.302 --> 00:34:15.177
Finish the share.

600
00:34:15.304 --> 00:34:17.679
This is for the benefit
of the group.

601
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:27.647
He pulled down my shorts and he
jammed his fingers inside of me.

602
00:34:27.733 --> 00:34:31.401
And it hurt really bad.

603
00:34:31.487 --> 00:34:34.780
And I heard him
tell my brother.

604
00:34:34.865 --> 00:34:39.910
Andrew didn't look at me
for a month.

605
00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:43.789
Great. Let's hear some feedback
from the group. please.

606
00:34:43.874 --> 00:34:45.865
How short were your shorts?

607
00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:47.084
Yes. Good.

608
00:34:47.169 --> 00:34:50.703
What was your participation
in the event?

609
00:34:50.798 --> 00:34:52.255
You must've said something
to him.

610
00:34:52.341 --> 00:34:54.382
Like something flirty to make
him think you were into it.

611
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:55.759
Very good.

612
00:34:55.844 --> 00:34:58.929
And in what way were you giving
Kevin mixed signals?

613
00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:03.308
Maybe you were trying
to tempt him?

614
00:35:03.393 --> 00:35:07.771
Resist the devil and he will
flee from you.

615
00:35:07.856 --> 00:35:10.148
Court him and you will
have shackles.

616
00:35:10.234 --> 00:35:15.728
Not on your wrist
but on your soul.

617
00:35:15.823 --> 00:35:18.073
Don't duck under accountability.

618
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.244
You are not a victim.
Tears are just an escape.

619
00:35:22.371 --> 00:35:24.704
Face your flaws.

620
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.123
Adams.

621
00:35:28.043 --> 00:35:30.252
Let's hear some feedback.

622
00:35:34.216 --> 00:35:35.757
This is the third time

623
00:35:35.884 --> 00:35:40.345
you've refused to participate
in group therapy.

624
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:41.888
I'm gonna have to report you
to Miss Connie

625
00:35:41.974 --> 00:35:44.057
if things don't change.

626
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.192
[knocking]

627
00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.281
Oh. I didn't know we were
allowed in each other's rooms.

628
00:35:59.408 --> 00:36:00.657
We're not.

629
00:36:00.742 --> 00:36:02.993
Staff said that you weren't
opening up

630
00:36:03.078 --> 00:36:05.954
and they offered me leadership
points to talk to you.

631
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.501
So. you're just here
for privileges?

632
00:36:11.587 --> 00:36:13.587
No. uh. it's a bonus.

633
00:36:13.672 --> 00:36:16.673
I... I wanted to see
you anyways.

634
00:36:16.758 --> 00:36:19.384
You know. I've been thinking
about you.

635
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:23.430
And... like. how
you've been doing.

636
00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:27.058
Well. invite the girl in.

637
00:36:27.144 --> 00:36:29.436
Oh. yeah. yeah... here.

638
00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:39.779
So. how long have you been
at Appaloosa?

639
00:36:39.865 --> 00:36:42.657
Almost a year.

640
00:36:42.784 --> 00:36:46.995
Does it get any easier?

641
00:36:47.122 --> 00:36:49.372
That depends what
you mean by "easy".

642
00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:51.491
I feel like I'm in jail.

643
00:36:51.585 --> 00:36:54.252
You have to find things
to look forward to.

644
00:36:54.338 --> 00:36:56.254
Things that they can't take.

645
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.506
Yeah. that's what Amanda
was saying

646
00:36:58.634 --> 00:37:00.592
that I have to find a guiding
star. you know.

647
00:37:00.677 --> 00:37:04.137
something to think about
while I'm in here.

648
00:37:04.223 --> 00:37:06.681
Until I'm out.

649
00:37:06.808 --> 00:37:08.725
I like that.

650
00:37:10.771 --> 00:37:11.811
-Scheff?
-[knocks]

651
00:37:13.732 --> 00:37:15.607
You've got a family call.

652
00:37:18.612 --> 00:37:21.196
Martinez. Back
in your room in 10.

653
00:37:27.079 --> 00:37:28.912
I think it's pretty cool that
you didn't give feedback

654
00:37:28.997 --> 00:37:31.248
to Ashley.

655
00:37:31.333 --> 00:37:33.416
Well. yeah. Poor girl.

656
00:37:33.502 --> 00:37:36.703
It's not her fault that
that happened to her.

657
00:37:36.797 --> 00:37:39.372
No. of course not.

658
00:37:39.466 --> 00:37:42.217
Everybody just kind of goes
with it here.

659
00:37:42.344 --> 00:37:45.512
I thought it was pretty brave
that you refused.

660
00:37:50.435 --> 00:37:54.312
It's pretty hard to be brave
in a place like this.

661
00:37:54.398 --> 00:37:55.438
Yeah.

662
00:37:59.111 --> 00:38:01.561
Wait for it to ring.
You don't dial out.

663
00:38:01.655 --> 00:38:02.904
If you dial out.
we cut the call.

664
00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:04.063
you get a consequence.

665
00:38:04.157 --> 00:38:05.398
I know the rules by now.

666
00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:07.534
I have to say them every time.

667
00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:09.619
Careful.

668
00:38:09.705 --> 00:38:11.913
No talk of the past.

669
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.292
I know. Keep it in the present.

670
00:38:24.553 --> 00:38:26.261
I'll be back in 20.

671
00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:35.520
[ringing]

672
00:38:35.605 --> 00:38:37.022
-Hello?
-Hey Panda.

673
00:38:37.107 --> 00:38:38.931
Hey Mom.

674
00:38:39.026 --> 00:38:40.650
-Getting ready for work?
-Yeah.

675
00:38:40.736 --> 00:38:42.769
I only got a minute.
You doing okay?

676
00:38:42.863 --> 00:38:43.862
Yeah. I'm fine.

677
00:38:43.947 --> 00:38:45.196
What are they feeding you
out there?

678
00:38:45.282 --> 00:38:46.448
Anything good?

679
00:38:46.575 --> 00:38:47.615
Same shit as always.

680
00:38:47.743 --> 00:38:49.275
You know I don't like it
when you swear.

681
00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:50.452
Where do you think
I learned it?

682
00:38:50.579 --> 00:38:52.162
Oh right. this is my fault.

683
00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:54.831
'Cause everything
is always my fault.

684
00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:59.252
Forget it. forget it. forget it.
Um... how's Jason?

685
00:38:59.338 --> 00:39:01.621
Uh... Jason's doing fine.

686
00:39:01.715 --> 00:39:05.467
He's outside skateboarding
near every chance he gets.

687
00:39:05.594 --> 00:39:06.801
A little Tony Hawk.

688
00:39:06.928 --> 00:39:08.127
He wears a helmet and pads.
right?

689
00:39:08.221 --> 00:39:09.629
Of course he does.

690
00:39:09.723 --> 00:39:11.389
God. You really think I'm
a terrible mother. don't you?

691
00:39:11.475 --> 00:39:13.475
I was just asking.

692
00:39:13.602 --> 00:39:15.852
Because raising kids is so easy.

693
00:39:15.937 --> 00:39:18.521
Can't wait 'til it's your turn.

694
00:39:18.607 --> 00:39:22.108
Okay. um... how's what's
his name... Steve?

695
00:39:22.194 --> 00:39:24.194
Long gone. He split
last month.

696
00:39:24.279 --> 00:39:27.405
Sorry. Mom. I... I knew
you liked him.

697
00:39:27.491 --> 00:39:29.908
Yeah. you don't know
nothing about anything.

698
00:39:29.993 --> 00:39:31.701
Liking someone ain't enough.

699
00:39:31.787 --> 00:39:33.745
Look. I gotta go. Okay?

700
00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:35.663
So... stay out of trouble.

701
00:39:35.791 --> 00:39:38.416
-I miss you...
-[dial tone]

702
00:39:47.803 --> 00:39:51.504
Seems like you and your mother
have a history.

703
00:39:51.598 --> 00:39:54.006
I love my mother very much.

704
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:59.345
You know. I used to be mad
at my mother all the time.

705
00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:01.564
Was she mean to you?

706
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:04.401
I thought so at the time
but then I grew up

707
00:40:04.486 --> 00:40:07.353
and I realized she was
just trying to help me.

708
00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:09.447
Just trying to make me stronger.

709
00:40:09.533 --> 00:40:12.492
Like a 'break you down.
build you up' sort of thing.

710
00:40:14.538 --> 00:40:17.205
You are a very smart girl.

711
00:40:17.332 --> 00:40:21.292
And I am sure that all of
our rules here drive you crazy.

712
00:40:21.378 --> 00:40:23.711
But if you just follow
the rules.

713
00:40:23.839 --> 00:40:24.838
every last one of them.

714
00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:27.882
you are going to make it
out there.

715
00:40:28.009 --> 00:40:29.509
You really believe that?

716
00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:31.261
I do.

717
00:40:33.014 --> 00:40:34.514
Room checks!

718
00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:36.641
Lights out in 10.

719
00:40:48.363 --> 00:40:49.863
Hey. that's for me.

720
00:41:11.553 --> 00:41:12.760
Ow!

721
00:41:12.888 --> 00:41:14.420
Do you think I'm blind?

722
00:41:14.514 --> 00:41:16.181
I forgot it was there
from class!

723
00:41:16.266 --> 00:41:17.974
Did I give you permission
to speak?

724
00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:21.060
You just asked me
a question!

725
00:41:21.146 --> 00:41:23.429
And you have just gotten
yourself some time

726
00:41:23.523 --> 00:41:26.274
on the Investment Unit.
Go!

727
00:42:03.563 --> 00:42:06.397
You don't seem very happy.
Kayla.

728
00:42:06.483 --> 00:42:08.316
Happy?

729
00:42:08.443 --> 00:42:12.320
How could anyone be happy
in a place like this?

730
00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:16.533
Why don't you tell me about
the school you were at before.

731
00:42:19.412 --> 00:42:21.320
It sucked.

732
00:42:21.414 --> 00:42:23.656
I was failing all my classes

733
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:28.378
and these boys used to bully me.
like. every day.

734
00:42:28.463 --> 00:42:31.664
And what did they say?

735
00:42:31.758 --> 00:42:34.467
Made fun of the way I dressed.

736
00:42:34.553 --> 00:42:37.169
Called me stupid.

737
00:42:37.264 --> 00:42:40.006
Did you tell your parents?

738
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.891
I tried.

739
00:42:41.977 --> 00:42:44.060
And?

740
00:42:44.145 --> 00:42:49.274
My step-dad said to ignore them
because 'boys will be boys'.

741
00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:51.025
And my mom's...

742
00:42:53.321 --> 00:42:55.905
Tell me what you're feeling.

743
00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:02.245
I feel like no one believes me.

744
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:05.081
I tried to tell my teachers
that I see letters.

745
00:43:05.166 --> 00:43:07.533
um. different. and then
they just said

746
00:43:07.627 --> 00:43:09.869
that I wasn't trying
hard enough.

747
00:43:09.963 --> 00:43:13.298
My mom was just like.

748
00:43:13.383 --> 00:43:15.708
"Maybe the boys are just
flirting with you.

749
00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:17.677
"Did you ever think about that?"

750
00:43:22.684 --> 00:43:24.884
It was like I tried to tell
the adults in my life

751
00:43:24.978 --> 00:43:26.561
what's going on and then
they just think

752
00:43:26.688 --> 00:43:29.522
that I'm some liar.

753
00:43:29.608 --> 00:43:32.275
I'm like a sneaky little liar
and then I come here

754
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.610
and oh. my God.

755
00:43:33.695 --> 00:43:34.736
everyone's constantly
telling me that it's true.

756
00:43:34.863 --> 00:43:36.904
That I am an addict.
that I am a liar

757
00:43:37.032 --> 00:43:38.573
and that I'm just
a bad person.

758
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:43.578
And then... then I'm just.
like. scared.

759
00:43:43.705 --> 00:43:50.251
I'm just. like. so scared
that maybe...

760
00:43:50.378 --> 00:43:52.962
maybe deep down
they're right.

761
00:43:53.048 --> 00:43:56.507
Maybe my parents shouldn't
believe me.

762
00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:04.515
Maybe I am a terrible person.

763
00:44:06.895 --> 00:44:10.930
Thank you for telling me
how you feel.

764
00:44:11.024 --> 00:44:13.775
You don't think I'm bad?

765
00:44:13.902 --> 00:44:15.902
No. Kayla.

766
00:44:15.987 --> 00:44:17.487
I think you're having
trouble processing

767
00:44:17.572 --> 00:44:22.108
everything you're feeling but
you're doing the best you can.

768
00:44:22.202 --> 00:44:25.578
And I'm going to help you.

769
00:44:25.664 --> 00:44:27.830
If you let me.

770
00:44:30.251 --> 00:44:34.295
Teacher: Starting with the line
segment already provided.

771
00:44:34.422 --> 00:44:38.132
We're going to continue
constructing our polygon

772
00:44:38.259 --> 00:44:40.885
using a series of similar edges.

773
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:46.683
Now. measuring from...

774
00:45:00.907 --> 00:45:02.907
[screams]

775
00:45:02.992 --> 00:45:04.650
Teacher: Dial 9. dial 9!

776
00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:06.577
Security needed in Classroom 4!

777
00:45:06.663 --> 00:45:09.038
Security in Classroom 4!

778
00:45:09.124 --> 00:45:12.250
Class: Booty juice! Booty juice!
Booty juice!

779
00:45:12.335 --> 00:45:14.919
Booty juice! Booty juice!
Booty juice!

780
00:45:15.004 --> 00:45:17.672
Teacher: We need the nurse
to the math class right away!

781
00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:25.680
I just want everyone
to know that Green

782
00:45:25.807 --> 00:45:27.673
is going to be just fine.

783
00:45:27.767 --> 00:45:29.976
She's in the nurse's unit
and she'll be back soon.

784
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:32.678
It looked much worse
than it actually was.

785
00:45:32.772 --> 00:45:33.896
Permission to speak.

786
00:45:33.982 --> 00:45:35.181
Yes. Torres?

787
00:45:35.275 --> 00:45:36.348
What about Lindsay?

788
00:45:36.443 --> 00:45:39.694
Fry is cooling off
in observation.

789
00:45:39.821 --> 00:45:41.353
Now. onto achievements.

790
00:45:41.448 --> 00:45:42.905
Harris: Gym.

791
00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:45.450
Torres. McDonald: TV.

792
00:45:45.535 --> 00:45:47.034
Adams...

793
00:45:49.706 --> 00:45:51.539
Adams?

794
00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:54.033
Hello?

795
00:45:54.127 --> 00:45:58.671
You have earned yourself a phone
call with your family.

796
00:45:58.757 --> 00:46:00.256
That'll be all.

797
00:46:05.346 --> 00:46:12.769
â™ª

798
00:46:12.854 --> 00:46:18.316
â™ª Love can be understood â™ª

799
00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:25.907
â™ª I am sick of attachments
I recently learned â™ª

800
00:46:26.034 --> 00:46:33.122
â™ª I can't relax and
I'm scared of myself â™ª

801
00:46:33.208 --> 00:46:37.251
â™ª I'm scared for my health â™ª

802
00:46:37.378 --> 00:46:44.342
â™ª Tell me you'll take me
back home â™ª

803
00:46:44.427 --> 00:46:46.552
Back to your room. Scheff!

804
00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.656
Hey!

805
00:47:08.034 --> 00:47:10.276
Hey. I wasn't gone that long.

806
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:12.278
Well... Are you okay?

807
00:47:12.372 --> 00:47:13.830
Of course I'm okay.

808
00:47:13.915 --> 00:47:16.374
I just got a cramp from writing
out all that religious bullshit.

809
00:47:16.459 --> 00:47:18.626
Well. you missed the drama.

810
00:47:18.753 --> 00:47:20.119
And the blood.

811
00:47:20.213 --> 00:47:21.170
Tell me everything.

812
00:47:21.256 --> 00:47:22.121
Okay.

813
00:47:22.215 --> 00:47:23.289
[giggles]

814
00:47:23.383 --> 00:47:26.625
But first... what the hell
is booty juice?

815
00:47:26.719 --> 00:47:29.971
You have been here
how long now?

816
00:47:30.098 --> 00:47:32.631
Five months and three days.

817
00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:34.225
And yet you don't know
what booty juice is

818
00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:35.601
after five months.

819
00:47:35.687 --> 00:47:39.397
Okay. Well. like. I've heard
the girls talk about it.

820
00:47:39.482 --> 00:47:40.481
Haldol.

821
00:47:40.608 --> 00:47:42.400
It's an antipsychotic
and sedative.

822
00:47:42.485 --> 00:47:44.151
Knocks you out stone cold.

823
00:47:44.279 --> 00:47:45.361
Oh. you've had it before?

824
00:47:45.446 --> 00:47:47.697
Yup. Shoot you right here.

825
00:47:47.782 --> 00:47:50.324
That's why they call it
"booty juice".

826
00:47:50.451 --> 00:47:52.368
That can't be legal.

827
00:47:52.453 --> 00:47:53.995
Girl. you've been
paying attention.

828
00:47:54.122 --> 00:47:55.830
all this ain't legal.

829
00:47:58.042 --> 00:47:59.166
Yeah.

830
00:48:04.924 --> 00:48:07.592
This is the longest I've gone
without talking to my mom.

831
00:48:07.677 --> 00:48:09.677
Well. then relax and enjoy.

832
00:48:09.804 --> 00:48:11.596
Why can't I talk to them
in private.

833
00:48:11.681 --> 00:48:13.055
like Amanda does?

834
00:48:13.141 --> 00:48:15.683
Well. remember everyone here
is on a different timeline.

835
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:17.602
And the staff determines if
you've earned that privilege.

836
00:48:17.687 --> 00:48:18.853
not me.

837
00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.680
But let's start here
and if all goes well

838
00:48:21.774 --> 00:48:24.442
I'm sure you'll have your
private phone time soon.

839
00:48:24.527 --> 00:48:25.943
Okay.

840
00:48:28.364 --> 00:48:30.323
[ringing]

841
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.858
Hello Mr. and Mrs. Adams.

842
00:48:32.952 --> 00:48:35.119
This is Doctor Jameson.
we spoke last week.

843
00:48:35.204 --> 00:48:39.165
I have Kayla here with me and
she's very eager to say hello.

844
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.207
Mom?

845
00:48:40.335 --> 00:48:41.542
Hi honey!

846
00:48:41.669 --> 00:48:44.420
It feels so good
to hear your voice.

847
00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:45.204
Yours too.

848
00:48:45.298 --> 00:48:46.297
Hi Kay.

849
00:48:46.382 --> 00:48:47.882
Hey Ray.

850
00:48:48.009 --> 00:48:49.550
We've been trying to get in
touch with you for a while.

851
00:48:49.677 --> 00:48:51.877
honey. but I guess
somebody's having too
much fun to talk. huh?

852
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:53.429
Mm-hmm.

853
00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:55.848
Here at Appaloosa it takes time
for the students

854
00:48:55.934 --> 00:48:58.217
to earn phone privileges.

855
00:48:58.311 --> 00:49:00.895
They're each on
a different path.

856
00:49:01.022 --> 00:49:04.482
Well. what you been up to?
You been horseback riding yet?

857
00:49:04.567 --> 00:49:06.067
Uh... no.

858
00:49:06.194 --> 00:49:07.777
Swimming? You gotta get
in that pool. girl.

859
00:49:07.862 --> 00:49:10.571
Summer's almost done!
Get in that pool!

860
00:49:12.283 --> 00:49:15.159
Honey? Is everything okay?

861
00:49:18.998 --> 00:49:20.706
Mom. you gotta come get me.
It's terrible here.

862
00:49:20.792 --> 00:49:22.166
They give us these pills.
they scream at us.

863
00:49:22.251 --> 00:49:23.626
and this girl got stabbed!
By a-

864
00:49:33.471 --> 00:49:34.920
Yes. it's Doctor Jameson.

865
00:49:35.014 --> 00:49:37.589
I'm very sorry but as
we warned you last week.

866
00:49:37.684 --> 00:49:39.266
Kayla is concocting
these stories

867
00:49:39.394 --> 00:49:41.102
to try to manipulate you.

868
00:49:41.229 --> 00:49:44.897
To make you feel guilty
so you'll come get her.

869
00:49:44.983 --> 00:49:46.983
No. No one was stabbed.

870
00:49:47.068 --> 00:49:48.776
There's no need for concern.
really.

871
00:49:48.903 --> 00:49:50.778
This is a common tactic.

872
00:49:50.905 --> 00:49:52.613
The important thing is we stick
to the program.

873
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.774
Now. Kayla is doing
very well here.

874
00:49:55.868 --> 00:49:57.785
She's taking time to adjust
to the full program

875
00:49:57.912 --> 00:50:00.329
but that's completely normal.

876
00:50:00.415 --> 00:50:01.414
Thank you.

877
00:50:01.499 --> 00:50:03.124
I'll check in next week.

878
00:50:04.919 --> 00:50:07.044
Kayla. I'm very disappointed
in you.

879
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:09.588
Now. if you promise never
to do anything like that again

880
00:50:09.674 --> 00:50:12.124
I won't tell Miss Connie.

881
00:50:12.218 --> 00:50:14.010
No. I. I promise.

882
00:50:16.973 --> 00:50:19.598
â™ª I can get
I can get through it â™ª

883
00:50:19.684 --> 00:50:22.685
â™ª I can get
I can get through it â™ª

884
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.646
â™ª I can get
I can get through it â™ª

885
00:50:25.773 --> 00:50:28.807
â™ª

886
00:50:28.901 --> 00:50:32.194
â™ª When the rain comes down
it really pours in â™ª

887
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.813
â™ª Pours in. pours in â™ª

888
00:50:34.907 --> 00:50:37.983
â™ª Don't believe the lies.
you know it's poison â™ª

889
00:50:38.077 --> 00:50:41.162
â™ª It's poison. it's poison â™ª

890
00:50:41.289 --> 00:50:44.123
â™ª You could turn the rain
to a rainbow â™ª

891
00:50:44.208 --> 00:50:46.709
â™ª You could turn a horn
to a halo â™ª

892
00:50:46.794 --> 00:50:48.419
â™ª When you don't
what you're gonna do â™ª

893
00:50:48.504 --> 00:50:50.880
I can't do it!

894
00:50:50.965 --> 00:50:52.923
It's okay.

895
00:50:53.009 --> 00:50:56.469
â™ª I've gone through some
things in my time yeah â™ª

896
00:50:56.554 --> 00:50:59.338
â™ª I can turn a penny
to a dime yeah â™ª

897
00:50:59.432 --> 00:51:00.639
Amanda.

898
00:51:01.768 --> 00:51:03.392
-I'll push you up.
-Okay.

899
00:51:05.188 --> 00:51:07.897
â™ª And I've seen some things that can make your skin crawl â™ª

900
00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:11.358
â™ª You gotta get up
every time that you fall â™ª

901
00:51:11.486 --> 00:51:13.519
â™ª You know what
you gotta do â™ª

902
00:51:13.613 --> 00:51:15.854
[cheering]

903
00:51:15.948 --> 00:51:17.114
Go. go. go!
Go. go. go!!!

904
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.243
â™ª I'll get get
I can get through it â™ª

905
00:51:21.329 --> 00:51:22.861
â™ª I'll get get
I can get through it â™ª

906
00:51:22.955 --> 00:51:25.456
â™ª I'll get get
I can get through it â™ª

907
00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:27.333
Go. go. go!!!

908
00:51:27.418 --> 00:51:29.368
â™ª I'll get get
I can get through it â™ª

909
00:51:29.462 --> 00:51:32.538
â™ª I'll get get
I can get through it â™ª

910
00:51:32.632 --> 00:51:34.673
Go. go. go!
Go. go. go!

911
00:51:34.759 --> 00:51:38.719
â™ª I'll get get
I can get through it â™ª

912
00:51:38.846 --> 00:51:41.097
[cheering]

913
00:51:41.182 --> 00:51:43.933
â™ª I'll get get
I can get through it â™ª

914
00:51:46.854 --> 00:51:47.895
Hey.

915
00:51:48.898 --> 00:51:51.232
What are you doing in here?

916
00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:53.359
I just wanted to see you.

917
00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:55.069
We're gonna get in
so much trouble.

918
00:51:55.196 --> 00:51:57.947
No. they can't see.

919
00:51:59.826 --> 00:52:01.367
Just five minutes.

920
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.540
What's wrong?

921
00:52:09.752 --> 00:52:14.171
I just never realized how touch
makes you feel so human.

922
00:52:14.257 --> 00:52:18.584
and so alive. you know?

923
00:52:18.678 --> 00:52:21.262
I know.

924
00:52:21.389 --> 00:52:27.226
If I couldn't touch you...
I think I'd die in here.

925
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.321
You were a warrior today.

926
00:52:39.407 --> 00:52:41.365
You're my guiding star.

927
00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:45.536
-I should go.
-Bye.

928
00:53:08.269 --> 00:53:09.635
So. you're doing better. honey?

929
00:53:09.729 --> 00:53:11.812
Yup. Doing great.

930
00:53:11.939 --> 00:53:13.647
Ray: How are those
classes going?

931
00:53:13.774 --> 00:53:16.650
Kayla is doing very well.
especially in algebra.

932
00:53:16.777 --> 00:53:18.485
Oh. I like the sound of that.

933
00:53:18.613 --> 00:53:20.112
Oh. and we did this ropes course

934
00:53:20.198 --> 00:53:23.315
and I helped all the girls in my
unit climb this really big wall.

935
00:53:23.409 --> 00:53:25.409
Sounds impressive!

936
00:53:25.494 --> 00:53:29.496
Unfortunately there is something
we all need to discuss.

937
00:53:29.624 --> 00:53:31.665
Something quite serious.

938
00:53:31.792 --> 00:53:33.542
Do you want to tell them
or should I?

939
00:53:33.628 --> 00:53:34.501
Tell them what?

940
00:53:34.629 --> 00:53:36.420
Honey. what's going on?

941
00:53:36.505 --> 00:53:38.964
I'm sorry to tell you that
your daughter is engaging

942
00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:41.667
in homosexual activity
here at Appaloosa.

943
00:53:41.761 --> 00:53:43.669
We're not sure how long
it's been going on

944
00:53:43.763 --> 00:53:45.971
but she is in some kind of
relationship with another girl.

945
00:53:46.057 --> 00:53:47.172
That's not true!

946
00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:49.934
She's just a friend.
There's been a mistake.

947
00:53:50.019 --> 00:53:51.268
I don't know what to say.

948
00:53:51.354 --> 00:53:52.686
I'm telling you Mom.
nothing...

949
00:53:52.813 --> 00:53:54.730
Kayla is exactly where
she needs to be.

950
00:53:54.815 --> 00:53:56.515
This is a psychological
disorder

951
00:53:56.609 --> 00:53:59.193
and we can begin treatment
right here. right now.

952
00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.362
Now. we'll discuss this more
at the next session.

953
00:54:01.489 --> 00:54:03.572
It's nothing we can't
figure out.

954
00:54:03.658 --> 00:54:06.617
Many girls have struggled
just like Kayla.

955
00:54:06.702 --> 00:54:09.954
They all found their way
with Jesus's love.

956
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:24.677
Stop looking at my body.
pervert.

957
00:54:26.347 --> 00:54:28.430
I wasn't looking at you.

958
00:54:32.061 --> 00:54:33.102
[blows whistle]

959
00:54:36.357 --> 00:54:38.607
Martinez...

960
00:54:38.693 --> 00:54:41.235
You're transferred
to Unit 3.

961
00:54:41.362 --> 00:54:43.237
You have 10 minutes
to pack your stuff.

962
00:54:43.364 --> 00:54:45.614
I'll meet you upstairs.

963
00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:47.408
Now! Let's go!

964
00:55:04.927 --> 00:55:07.803
Everyone will forget
about it soon.

965
00:55:07.888 --> 00:55:12.141
It'll all blow over.
just give it time.

966
00:55:12.226 --> 00:55:15.093
You could write to each other.

967
00:55:15.187 --> 00:55:17.438
I'll help pass notes.

968
00:55:19.775 --> 00:55:21.817
Have you ever been in love?

969
00:55:25.114 --> 00:55:26.155
No.

970
00:55:29.827 --> 00:55:34.997
I don't think I can do this
without her.

971
00:55:43.424 --> 00:55:47.009
She was my guiding star.

972
00:55:47.094 --> 00:55:50.137
Honestly. you sound like a kid.

973
00:55:50.264 --> 00:55:51.680
We won't be in here forever.

974
00:55:51.766 --> 00:55:55.351
There's a whole world waiting
for us out there.

975
00:55:55.436 --> 00:55:57.186
Voice: Shut down!

976
00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:08.364
Hey... it'll be okay.

977
00:56:40.606 --> 00:56:43.181
[screaming]
Help!

978
00:56:43.275 --> 00:56:45.109
Help!

979
00:56:45.194 --> 00:56:46.235
Help!

980
00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:58.705
Help me!

981
00:56:58.833 --> 00:57:00.040
Only you control
what's in your mind!

982
00:57:00.167 --> 00:57:01.333
That's your freedom!

983
00:57:01.419 --> 00:57:07.297
Don't give it away. Kayla!
Do you hear me?!

984
00:57:07.383 --> 00:57:09.883
Hold her up!
She's still breathing.

985
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:12.094
Girls. get back in your rooms.

986
00:57:12.179 --> 00:57:14.263
She put herself there.
She won't talk.

987
00:57:23.983 --> 00:57:26.400
I know what this is.

988
00:57:26.527 --> 00:57:30.228
You want attention.
plain and simple.

989
00:57:30.322 --> 00:57:32.230
If you think I'm gonna
let you sit here

990
00:57:32.324 --> 00:57:37.235
and soak up all this attention.
think again.

991
00:57:37.329 --> 00:57:40.456
If you want to throw a pity
party for yourself

992
00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:44.001
you can do that in Obs.

993
00:58:11.238 --> 00:58:13.438
Amanda: You gotta find something
to focus on.

994
00:58:13.532 --> 00:58:15.782
Your guiding star. remember?

995
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:18.944
What's your star?

996
00:58:19.038 --> 00:58:20.329
It's me.

997
00:58:23.501 --> 00:58:25.083
It's inside me.

998
00:58:29.632 --> 00:58:31.089
[laughs]

999
00:58:37.264 --> 00:58:38.805
Miss Connie?

1000
00:58:38.933 --> 00:58:42.133
How long should we keep
Adams in Obs?

1001
00:58:42.228 --> 00:58:45.103
Until I tell you to take
her out.

1002
00:58:47.274 --> 00:58:48.690
Spit it out. Trent.

1003
00:58:48.776 --> 00:58:52.143
What if she was really...
should we call her parents?

1004
00:58:52.238 --> 00:58:54.980
Are you kidding?
They would take her out.

1005
00:58:55.074 --> 00:58:56.031
Yeah. but...

1006
00:58:56.116 --> 00:58:57.533
The educational advisor
at her school

1007
00:58:57.618 --> 00:59:00.986
sent her here and we paid him
for it.

1008
00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.829
And now there's at least
six months left

1009
00:59:02.957 --> 00:59:04.540
on her parents' insurance
and that's how

1010
00:59:04.625 --> 00:59:08.377
we are able to offer
this service to these girls.

1011
00:59:08.462 --> 00:59:09.378
Yes. ma'am.

1012
00:59:09.463 --> 00:59:10.671
You're a hard worker.

1013
00:59:10.798 --> 00:59:15.509
I hired you with only a GED.
Isn't that right?

1014
00:59:15.636 --> 00:59:19.337
Adams. poor girl. she had
a lapse in judgement

1015
00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:24.351
and I feel for her. I really do.

1016
00:59:24.478 --> 00:59:26.186
That'll be all. Trent.

1017
00:59:30.651 --> 00:59:31.900
Miss Adams...

1018
00:59:33.988 --> 00:59:37.698
Your back. We missed
you the last two weeks.

1019
00:59:38.659 --> 00:59:40.242
Excellent.

1020
00:59:50.004 --> 00:59:52.087
[crying]

1021
00:59:52.172 --> 00:59:53.755
I'm not seeing what
I think I'm seeing.

1022
00:59:53.841 --> 00:59:54.873
Ma'am?

1023
00:59:54.967 --> 00:59:57.208
I have been very clear
with the staff.

1024
00:59:57.303 --> 00:59:59.052
I don't ever want to see
that kind of conduct.

1025
00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:00.220
Understood?

1026
01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:01.763
Yes. ma'am.

1027
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.142
I want you to keep an eye
on Adams.

1028
01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:08.562
Ever since she came back
from Obs she's been willful.

1029
01:00:08.689 --> 01:00:11.231
I don't like it and I don't
think it's good for the others.

1030
01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.233
Keep her off balance.

1031
01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:27.080
I'm worried about you.

1032
01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:29.041
I'm fine. it's okay.

1033
01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:33.545
Really and truly?

1034
01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:35.380
Really and truly.

1035
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.177
Hey. I just want
to say something.

1036
01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:43.513
Look at me.

1037
01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.185
Look at me.

1038
01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:53.732
What?

1039
01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:02.699
There is nothing wrong
with being gay.

1040
01:01:02.785 --> 01:01:04.943
Hey.

1041
01:01:05.037 --> 01:01:07.079
I love you for exactly
who you are.

1042
01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:10.999
Don't change for anybody.

1043
01:01:11.085 --> 01:01:13.794
Hmm?

1044
01:01:13.921 --> 01:01:16.838
And I have something for you.

1045
01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:23.294
â™ª Happy birthday to you. â™ª

1046
01:01:23.389 --> 01:01:24.221
[laughing]

1047
01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:26.431
â™ª Happy birthday to you. â™ª

1048
01:01:26.517 --> 01:01:29.226
â™ª Happy birthday.
dear Kayla. â™ª

1049
01:01:29.311 --> 01:01:33.138
â™ª Happy birthday to you. â™ª

1050
01:01:33.232 --> 01:01:34.648
Okay.

1051
01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:35.816
The candle's dripping.

1052
01:01:35.943 --> 01:01:37.401
Better make a wish fast!

1053
01:01:41.615 --> 01:01:43.657
What'd you wish for?

1054
01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:45.033
You know I can't tell you that.

1055
01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:46.535
Rude!

1056
01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.869
[laughing]

1057
01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:06.054
Look at these wrinkles.

1058
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:07.889
Lazy!

1059
01:02:07.975 --> 01:02:09.850
Make it again.

1060
01:02:11.437 --> 01:02:13.270
Yes. ma'am.

1061
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.738
Well?

1062
01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:25.282
I guess I can tell you
what I wished for

1063
01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:26.992
since it wasn't a real cake.

1064
01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.034
Rude.

1065
01:02:28.162 --> 01:02:29.786
[laughing]

1066
01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:37.702
I wished that we could get
in a car.

1067
01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:41.840
just you and me. and we can
just... take off.

1068
01:02:44.762 --> 01:02:46.094
Where we going?

1069
01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:50.974
Oh... anywhere we want.
It's an open road.

1070
01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.934
[laughs]

1071
01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.644
It's kind of a lame wish.
Adams.

1072
01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:56.062
What?

1073
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:57.939
Dream bigger!

1074
01:02:58.025 --> 01:03:00.233
I mean. please tell me
it's a sexy red convertible

1075
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.236
we're driving off into
the sunset in. Thelma.

1076
01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:10.535
Okay. let's get some feedback.

1077
01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:12.245
Torres?

1078
01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:14.989
You've got anger issues.

1079
01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:16.333
You don't even try
to get better.

1080
01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.959
It's like you're more
comfortable in here

1081
01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:19.494
than you are out there.

1082
01:03:19.588 --> 01:03:21.004
It's really sad.

1083
01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:22.297
Okay. great!

1084
01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:24.674
Gives you a sense of what
you need to work on.

1085
01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.053
Who's up next?

1086
01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:29.971
I'll go.

1087
01:03:30.057 --> 01:03:33.058
Adams. Yeah. excellent!
Way to volunteer.

1088
01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:38.179
You act like you don't
belong here.

1089
01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:40.315
Like you're better
than everyone.

1090
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.275
Like your shit don't stink.

1091
01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:45.529
No one feels safe around you

1092
01:03:45.656 --> 01:03:47.364
'cause we know what
you're really thinking.

1093
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.282
You're a pervert and if you ever
try to touch me...

1094
01:03:49.368 --> 01:03:51.701
No threats. please.

1095
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:52.953
We're giving Adams feedback

1096
01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:55.247
on what she can improve
about herself.

1097
01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:58.291
Okay. my feedback is to ask
God to straighten you out.

1098
01:03:58.377 --> 01:04:00.043
Literally.

1099
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.379
[coughing]

1100
01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:03.922
She's doing it on purpose.

1101
01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:05.215
[coughing]

1102
01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:07.217
Adams!

1103
01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:09.010
Your family are here for you.

1104
01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:11.096
[coughing]

1105
01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.056
Maggie: Let's not keep
them waiting.

1106
01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:15.684
Kayla is doing so well
in all of her classes.

1107
01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:17.811
We couldn't be more proud
of her.

1108
01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:18.645
Thank you.

1109
01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:19.980
You know. in the brochure

1110
01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:22.774
it said that there was a heated
swimming pool?

1111
01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:27.279
Oh yeah. it is. uh... under
construction for the winter.

1112
01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:30.657
So. let me show you where you
can have a little time together.

1113
01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:32.492
Just right through here.

1114
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.080
-Yeah!
-Yay!

1115
01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:49.250
-Happy birthday. sweetheart.
-Thanks. mom.

1116
01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:50.427
16.

1117
01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.262
I can hardly believe it.

1118
01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:53.430
I know.

1119
01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:55.265
We want you to know how proud
we are of you.

1120
01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:58.351
I've been making up lots
of ground and learning

1121
01:04:58.437 --> 01:05:03.940
emotional coping strategies for
when I'm back at school at home.

1122
01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:04.816
You know?

1123
01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:06.943
Mm-hmm. yeah. Um...

1124
01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:12.449
You know. um... why don't we
stick to what's been working?

1125
01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:13.909
Mmmhmm.

1126
01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:20.949
Nice to see your parents?

1127
01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:22.000
I guess?

1128
01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.835
Do they know about?

1129
01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:26.546
Not a clue.

1130
01:05:26.632 --> 01:05:28.289
No.

1131
01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:30.300
At least they came
to see you.

1132
01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.971
I don't even know what to say
to them anymore.

1133
01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:36.848
You know. like. they don't
trust me to tell the truth

1134
01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:38.558
and I don't trust them
to believe me.

1135
01:05:38.644 --> 01:05:40.727
And then we're all
just sitting there.

1136
01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:43.396
playing pretend.

1137
01:05:43.482 --> 01:05:48.401
I hate to break it to you but
we're all just playing pretend.

1138
01:05:48.487 --> 01:05:49.861
What. you don't think so?

1139
01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:52.447
No. I... I just love it

1140
01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:55.116
when you randomly say
something really wise.

1141
01:05:55.202 --> 01:05:58.870
It's like Yoda.

1142
01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:01.247
[Yoda voice]
Give up. do not.

1143
01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:07.662
Free soon. you shall be.
Yes. mmm.

1144
01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:09.339
You're a freak.

1145
01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:10.882
Junk on the bunk!

1146
01:06:10.968 --> 01:06:11.833
Now?

1147
01:06:11.927 --> 01:06:13.259
Now.

1148
01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:23.728
Just a bra. Bryce.

1149
01:06:31.238 --> 01:06:33.989
What. you think her parents put
drugs inside the birthday cake?

1150
01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:36.282
Standard procedure
after a visit.

1151
01:06:36.368 --> 01:06:38.159
Hey. Bryce.

1152
01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:42.205
You know I turn 18 in three
months and eight days.

1153
01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.457
[giggling]

1154
01:06:44.543 --> 01:06:46.626
I don't give a rat's ass.

1155
01:06:46.712 --> 01:06:50.296
I'm gonna miss you. Bryce.

1156
01:06:50.382 --> 01:06:51.706
No talking.

1157
01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.425
It's shut down.

1158
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:54.926
Good night.

1159
01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.444
I'll miss you.
Like. so much.

1160
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:13.728
Don't start.

1161
01:07:13.822 --> 01:07:16.865
February 22nd is
a long way off.

1162
01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:20.785
Go to sleep.

1163
01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:31.296
Here we go.

1164
01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:33.965
And no talking
during the movie.

1165
01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:37.260
â™ª

1166
01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:39.095
Popcorn or candy.

1167
01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:43.516
Popcorn with lots of butter.

1168
01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:45.935
Coke or Sprite?

1169
01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:48.646
I mix them together.

1170
01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:50.148
Eww.

1171
01:07:50.901 --> 01:07:55.653
[coughing]

1172
01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.864
Hey! Hey! Out!

1173
01:07:57.949 --> 01:07:59.032
-Out.
-Turn it up.

1174
01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:14.005
[coughing]

1175
01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:15.924
[coughing]

1176
01:08:28.105 --> 01:08:29.104
[coughs]

1177
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:30.471
Did I give you permission
to cough?

1178
01:08:30.565 --> 01:08:31.815
No.

1179
01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:35.944
You know the rules. Scheff.

1180
01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:37.904
Would you like us all to wait
until you ask?

1181
01:08:37.989 --> 01:08:40.406
[coughing]

1182
01:08:40.492 --> 01:08:42.575
If you make one more sound
without my permission

1183
01:08:42.661 --> 01:08:45.161
you will be headed off
to Investment.

1184
01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:47.155
She's clearly sick
and needs help!

1185
01:08:47.249 --> 01:08:48.748
What is wrong with you?

1186
01:08:48.834 --> 01:08:51.835
Who asks permission
to cough?

1187
01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:54.379
If you learn the rules in here.

1188
01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:58.091
out there. the rules
will be easy as pie.

1189
01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:00.510
And thank you so much
for volunteering

1190
01:09:00.637 --> 01:09:02.554
to take Scheff's place
in Investment.

1191
01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:04.305
You may go.

1192
01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.977
Adams. you keep this up

1193
01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:12.689
and I promise you I will
transfer you to another unit.

1194
01:09:23.118 --> 01:09:24.534
Okay.

1195
01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.995
It's hot dog night.

1196
01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.121
[stifled cough]

1197
01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:42.719
Well. I've been coughing
a lot lately

1198
01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:46.097
and my chest feels
really heavy.

1199
01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:48.183
Like it's full of something.

1200
01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:50.393
And at night it hurts so bad
to breathe

1201
01:09:50.478 --> 01:09:53.521
I can barely take a breath in
without coughing.

1202
01:09:53.607 --> 01:09:55.148
Mmm.

1203
01:09:55.275 --> 01:09:56.566
You're fine.

1204
01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:58.067
Just drink more water.

1205
01:09:58.153 --> 01:10:00.987
Nurse Patty.
something is really wrong.

1206
01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:02.363
I can tell.

1207
01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:05.742
Oh. you can tell?
Are you a doctor now?

1208
01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:07.577
I need help.

1209
01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:10.038
I'm spitting up blood.

1210
01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:17.337
Okay.

1211
01:10:17.464 --> 01:10:19.756
You may have the start
of a low-grade fever.

1212
01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:21.299
Go rest up in your room.

1213
01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:23.760
You can take the rest
of the day off class.

1214
01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:24.886
That's it?

1215
01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:25.929
That's it.

1216
01:10:26.014 --> 01:10:27.847
Should do the trick.

1217
01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:39.776
[whimpering]

1218
01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:42.570
Oh. my god. Amanda!
Oh. my god.

1219
01:10:42.656 --> 01:10:43.780
It hurts to breathe.

1220
01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:46.532
We need to get you help.

1221
01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.201
[coughs]

1222
01:10:51.248 --> 01:10:54.123
Okay. um. tell me your mom's
phone number.

1223
01:10:54.209 --> 01:10:56.876
She won't believe you.

1224
01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:58.795
And how are you going
to get near a phone?

1225
01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.797
Don't worry about that. okay?

1226
01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:07.762
8-4-3. 4-5-5-5.

1227
01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:10.848
I swear on my life that
I'm going to get you help.

1228
01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:12.141
Your life. huh?

1229
01:11:12.227 --> 01:11:14.602
Yeah. it means something
that I...

1230
01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:16.721
it means something
and it's because of you.

1231
01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:19.399
Don't get all sappy on me.
Adams.

1232
01:11:21.569 --> 01:11:23.111
Adams. get your stuff.

1233
01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:23.945
What? Why?

1234
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:25.280
You're being transferred.

1235
01:11:25.365 --> 01:11:26.155
Why?

1236
01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:27.156
I warned you.

1237
01:11:27.242 --> 01:11:28.658
You need an attitude adjustment

1238
01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:31.202
and you're going to do it in

Ms. Scheff. hello.

I would love an explanation as
to why somebody was calling me

1315
01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:11.941
late last night. screaming
about my daughter dying?

1316
01:16:12.026 --> 01:16:13.818
And why it's taken me hours
to get through to you.

I am so sorry.

1318
01:16:15.655 --> 01:16:17.613
One of the students got into
the phone room last night.

1319
01:16:17.699 --> 01:16:20.908
They're just trying to cause
as much trouble as possible

1320
01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:22.577
and making things up
to get attention.

1321
01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:24.036
Well. she certainly got mine.

1322
01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:26.831
I can assure you Ms. Scheff.
Amanda is doing just fine.

1323
01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:29.125
I would like to talk to her.

1324
01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:33.212
Unfortunately. she is in group
therapy at the moment

1325
01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:36.507
and it is not possible to take
her out in the middle.

1326
01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:38.467
Well. then have her call me
when she's done.

1327
01:16:38.553 --> 01:16:40.886
Um. Amanda has a very full day.

1328
01:16:41.014 --> 01:16:43.306
So perhaps she could call you
later this week?

1329
01:16:43.391 --> 01:16:46.309
Look. I know my kid
ain't no angel. alright?

1330
01:16:46.394 --> 01:16:48.561
But what kind of a school
is this

1331
01:16:48.688 --> 01:16:52.231
that I don't get to talk to
my own kid when I want to?

1332
01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:54.567

01:16:54.694 --> 01:16:58.729
I'm sorry Ms. Scheff.
it's just not possible.

but if you won't let me talk

to my daughter then
I am coming to her.

when I get there.

Then how'd you let her get so
sick before calling for help?

all the time.

she was this sick?

We did.

1351
01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:54.669
You said she was faking.

01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:39.852
Excuse me.

1413
01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:42.229
You're welcome.

1414
01:21:42.315 --> 01:21:44.398
And screw you.

1415
01:21:49.947 --> 01:21:51.155
Okay.

1416
01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:01.290
â™ª

1417
01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:07.880
[chattering]

1418
01:22:08.007 --> 01:22:09.840
Jason. go play outside. okay?

1419
01:22:09.926 --> 01:22:11.383
Ugh!

1420
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:12.843
Whatever.

1421
01:22:14.013 --> 01:22:16.555
They said no unnecessary
movement.

1422
01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:19.266
It's just a video game.
You're treating me like a baby.

1423
01:22:19.352 --> 01:22:21.727
Well. that's because
you're acting like a baby.

1424
01:22:28.027 --> 01:22:29.401
You sure that's her?

1425
01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:31.487
Pretty sure.

1426
01:22:31.572 --> 01:22:36.075
Wait. Mom... I need you
to help me talk to her.

1427
01:22:36.202 --> 01:22:39.161
But I don't even know the lady.

1428
01:22:39.246 --> 01:22:42.122
You know how you didn't want
to believe me at first?

1429
01:22:42.208 --> 01:22:43.791
Kayla's mom's not going
to either.

1430
01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:44.833
That's what Appaloosa does.

1431
01:22:44.919 --> 01:22:47.628
They train you
not to believe us.

1432
01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:49.079
Uh... I don't know.

1433
01:22:49.173 --> 01:22:51.173
She will listen to you!

1434
01:22:51.258 --> 01:22:53.759
Can you talk to her.
mom to mom.

1435
01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:55.344
Please?

1436
01:22:57.932 --> 01:22:59.014
You've been here so long

1437
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.975
we might as well move
your bed in here.

1438
01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:02.810
Sounds good to me.

1439
01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:05.187
You know. I do care about
you girls.

1440
01:23:05.272 --> 01:23:07.022
And I care about Amanda.

1441
01:23:08.943 --> 01:23:11.276
You would've let her die.

1442
01:23:11.404 --> 01:23:13.862
And for what?
Insurance money?

1443
01:23:13.948 --> 01:23:15.406
I made a mistake.

1444
01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:17.491
I should've called the doctor
much sooner.

1445
01:23:17.576 --> 01:23:19.451
You know. I think I figured out
what I wanna do

1446
01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:21.328
when I leave here.

1447
01:23:21.414 --> 01:23:23.122
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

1448
01:23:23.249 --> 01:23:26.000
I've narrowed it down
to three choices.

1449
01:23:26.085 --> 01:23:29.670
A teacher. an engineer.
or lawyer...

1450
01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:32.006
so I can shut places
like this down.

1451
01:23:40.266 --> 01:23:41.849
Ray!

1452
01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.434
Come upstairs. now!

1453
01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:45.302
Ray: Baby. it's the fourth
quarter. I'll be up in a bit.

1454
01:23:45.396 --> 01:23:47.980
Come upstairs. now! I'm not
going to ask you again!

1455
01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:49.639
We're leaving
and you're driving.

1456
01:23:49.734 --> 01:23:50.733
What's going on?

1457
01:23:50.818 --> 01:23:52.693
I'll explain in the car.

1458
01:23:56.866 --> 01:23:58.407
Grab your stuff.

1459
01:23:58.492 --> 01:24:00.159
Your parents are here
to take you home.

1460
01:24:00.286 --> 01:24:01.994
What'd I do?

1461
01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:03.454
Is this some sort of trick?

1462
01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:05.414
It's a new year's miracle.

1463
01:24:05.499 --> 01:24:07.499
You got five minutes.

1464
01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:23.390
â™ª

1465
01:24:23.476 --> 01:24:29.313
â™ª Take heart my love. â™ª

1466
01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:31.065
Don't look at her.

1467
01:24:31.150 --> 01:24:33.984
â™ª I can be your
sweet remedy. â™ª

1468
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:38.280
â™ª Just hold my hand. â™ª

1469
01:24:38.365 --> 01:24:42.826
â™ª Out into the night find peace
by the moonlight â™ª

1470
01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:44.861
I said don't look at her!

1471
01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:49.458
â™ª Fear not my love â™ª

1472
01:24:49.543 --> 01:24:51.701
Clean up this mess!

1473
01:24:51.796 --> 01:24:54.129
â™ª Just fly with me â™ª

1474
01:24:54.215 --> 01:24:55.798
[Door buzzing]

1475
01:24:55.883 --> 01:24:59.802
â™ª Across the land â™ª

1476
01:24:59.887 --> 01:25:02.096
â™ª And over the sea â™ª

1477
01:25:02.181 --> 01:25:06.016
â™ª The sky that we breathe â™ª

1478
01:25:06.102 --> 01:25:09.886
â™ª I want you to know â™ª

1479
01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:12.481
â™ª You can lean on me â™ª

1480
01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:16.560
â™ª You can lean on â™ª

1481
01:25:16.654 --> 01:25:20.531
â™ª I just want you
to know â™ª

1482
01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:23.158
â™ª I will always be â™ª

1483
01:25:23.244 --> 01:25:28.163
â™ª I will always... â™ª

1484
01:25:28.249 --> 01:25:30.707
It's a very nice thing
you've done for your friend.

1485
01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:36.079
Well. she's the reason
I'm home.

1486
01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:39.883
-Hey. Mom. Ray...
-Yes.

1487
01:25:39.969 --> 01:25:44.847
This is all. like. really nice
but... it's not Amanda.

1488
01:25:44.932 --> 01:25:49.059
She'd. like. hate all of this.

1489
01:25:49.145 --> 01:25:50.477
[car horn honking]

1490
01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:53.772
Um... can I borrow the car?

1491
01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:55.691
Please?

1492
01:25:55.776 --> 01:25:57.818
-Sure. Ray?
-Yeah. Of course.

1493
01:25:59.238 --> 01:26:01.113
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1494
01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.407
I promise we'll be careful
and we'll be back really soon.

1495
01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:05.492
Like. maybe an hour.
or something?

1496
01:26:05.578 --> 01:26:10.664
[laughing]

1497
01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:19.506
â™ª

1498
01:26:19.592 --> 01:26:21.258
Oh. my God.

1499
01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:26.638
Wanna go for a ride?

1500
01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:28.223
Where we going?

1501
01:26:28.309 --> 01:26:29.600
Anywhere we want.

1502
01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:31.727
Open road. baby.

1503
01:26:36.609 --> 01:26:39.067
What's there?

1504
01:26:39.153 --> 01:26:41.695
Our new guiding star.

1505
01:26:44.325 --> 01:26:48.327
[laughing]
I love you.

1506
01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:51.663
Let's go. Thelma.
