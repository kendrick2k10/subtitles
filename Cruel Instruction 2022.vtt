of them sound familiar. Okay?

health centers?

00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:26.022
Is that like a hospital?

154
00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:27.682

nothing like that.

of added help

They. they also provide one
on one and group therapy

162
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.920
with trained and
board-certified professionals.

163
00:09:49.006 --> 00:09:50.872

by girls

164

the same issues as she is.

And the best part is
they're all in it together.

166

this would help Kayla

A special school.

183

What the hell?

184
00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:13.797
You changed my school
and you didn't even tell me?

185
00:11:13.924 --> 00:11:15.965
We're telling you now.

186
00:11:17.094 --> 00:11:18.218

187
00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.636

version of yourself.

194
00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.533

Thank you. Trent.

234
00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:40.568
Oh. honey. There's nothing
to worry about.

235
00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:42.195
You're going to be in and out
in no time

236
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.531

right here for you.

237
00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:46.825
-Okay.
-Okay.

238

Welcome to Appaloosa.

239
00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:56.709
Clothes off.

240
00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:04.259
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

241
00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.219
Clothes off. now.

242
00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:26.981
For you.

243
00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:29.158
And you.

244
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.621
And just over here.
you're first.

245
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:45.633
[urinating]

246
00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:50.013
Thank you.

247
00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.812
Adams. this way.

248
00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:11.326
[urinating]

249
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.996
Thank you.

250
00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:23.421
Great.

251
00:15:24.633 --> 00:15:27.008
Adams. you'll be up first.

252
00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:32.513
Okay.

253
00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.019
Get your heels there.

254
00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.898
And. uh. scooch forward.

255
00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:43.724
Just move your butt forward
as far as possible.

256
00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.059
Good. good. good.

257
00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.061
I've never done this before.

258
00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:48.571
It's standard procedure.
Come on.

259
00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.898
But I'm 15. Do I have to?

260
00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:53.201
Girls like you try and smuggle
in all kinds of things.

261
00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:54.735
I've seen it all.

262
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.329
Come on.

263
00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:00.541
Let's just get your
underwear there.

264
00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:05.713
Okay. I'll put those there.

265
00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:06.914
Good.

266
00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.508
So now you're going to feel
some pressure

267
00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:10.635
and it's going to feel cold.

268
00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.768
Hymen's still intact.

269
00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:20.728
Good girl.

270
00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.942
Don't let them see you cry.

271
00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.080
Ugh. it's the worst. I know.

272
00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:44.002
But it's over now so let me
show you around.

273
00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:46.546
Over here is our
pill dispensary.

274
00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:49.215
You'll be visiting that
at least once a day.

275
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.011
And then over here
we have the cafeteria

276
00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:56.305
which will be serving up
some very delicious food.

277
00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:59.058
And in here you'll have
your group therapy.

278
00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:00.968
twice a week.
with your unit.

279
00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:02.145
We have four units here.

280
00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:04.230
There's two upstairs.
there's two downstairs.

281
00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:07.859
But you will only have therapy
with your own.

282
00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:12.196
Speaking of...
this is Unit 2.

283
00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:15.533
Everybody please welcome
our two new members.

284
00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:18.494
Kayla Adams and Amanda Scheff.

285
00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.041
I said. say hello.

286
00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:25.543
All: Hi Kayla and Amanda.

287
00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.128
You'll be getting
your meds later.

288
00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:30.381
just helps you sleep a little
better after your long travels.

289
00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.050
Miss Harris?

290
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.344
You didn't take your meds.

291
00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:38.172
I'm not going to take
your stupid pills!

292
00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:39.340
Dial nine.

293
00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:40.391
No. I'll take the meds.
I'll take the meds.

294
00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:42.935
Girls stand up.
Turn around!

295
00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:45.346
-It's too late.
-Face the walls.

296
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.148
No. no. I'll take the pills!

297
00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.316
It's too late.

298
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.651
I'll take the pills.
I'll take the pills.

299
00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:51.694
[thud]

300
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:02.872
Dibs!

301
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.706
This door stays open
at all times. Understood?

302
00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:17.053
-What. even at night?
-Especially at night.

303
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.388
Okay. phones please.

304
00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:28.481
If you have music downloaded
you can still listen.

305
00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.691
Before bed only.

306
00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:38.533
[sighs]

307
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:45.906
First day's always rough.

308
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.908
Did you hear that girl's head?

309
00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:49.252
Like when it. when it
hit the ground?

310
00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:50.419
You gotta forget it.

311
00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:52.380
But what if she's. like.
seriously hurt?

312
00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.842
You can't think about anybody
but yourself in here.

313
00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:58.094
I do not think I'm supposed
to be here.

314
00:18:58.221 --> 00:18:59.762
My parents they thought
that they were sending me

315
00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.140
someplace different.

316
00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:03.141
Yeah. no shit.

317
00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:04.142
The parents never know
the truth.

318
00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:05.268
that's the whole point.

319
00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:08.146
You don't get it.
I can't stay here.

320
00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:12.316
No. Kayla.

321
00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:14.026
You don't get it.

322
00:19:14.112 --> 00:19:15.194
[knocks]

323
00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:19.157
Dinner! You can
settle in afterwards.

324
00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:25.246
Um... may I please speak
to my parents?

325
00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:26.998
Oh. honey. I'm afraid not.

326
00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:30.451
Phone privileges must be earned
and we really encourage

327
00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:34.288
all newcomers to have no outside
contact for at least a week.

328
00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:37.592
It's for your own benefit.
just helps you get acclimated

329
00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:41.053
without all of
the outside noise.

330
00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:45.349
But I can assure you that
your parents have been updated

331
00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:48.636
and all is well.

332
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.229
It's urgent.

333
00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:52.982
There's been. uh...
a mistake.

334
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.319
A mistake?

335
00:19:56.446 --> 00:20:01.282
I'm serious. I need
to call them.

336
00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:04.535
Why don't we have a seat
and have a little chat. Hmm?

337
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.542
In here. Kayla Adams. I'm your
mommy and your daddy

338
00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:14.161
and this is my house.

339
00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:19.333
And rule number one in my house
is no talking back. ever.

340
00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:20.718
Understood?

341
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.849
I asked you a question.

342
00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:45.034
No talking and no moving
until I say so.

343
00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:48.412
And every time you push back.
that will be another week

344
00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.197
without phone privileges.

345
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.699
And if this still continues.

346
00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.876
you will find yourself
in Investment.

347
00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:56.879
Is that understood?

348
00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:02.969
Dinner time!
Line structure.

349
00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:07.139
Arm's length apart.

350
00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:09.558
Dawn. take your hands
out of the pocket.

351
00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:11.519
[coughing]

352
00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:15.606
You need to ask my permission
every time you scratch your nose

353
00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:16.732
or you burp.

354
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.402
Do you got that?

355
00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:23.447
Why don't we tell Amanda
our five free phrases.

356
00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:24.907
Girls: Thank you. Sorry.

357
00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:28.119
Excuse me. You're welcome.
Bless you.

358
00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:29.161
Very good.

359
00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:32.206
Okay. Taco night!

360
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.254
Be glad you're missing
taco night.

361
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:41.090
I'll see you around hopefully.

362
00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:54.020
Miss Connie?

363
00:21:54.105 --> 00:21:56.147
Yes?

364
00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:59.483
Uh... you came down hard
on the new girls.

365
00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:02.445
Well. I find that it's best
to scare them

366
00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:04.271
right in the beginning.

367
00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:08.617
Then they fall in line quicker
and they learn to listen.

368
00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:12.997
Uh. yeah... Adams
is in shock though.

369
00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:15.666
What is our job here.
remember?

370
00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:16.784
To teach them discipline.

371
00:22:16.878 --> 00:22:18.786
No elbows on the tables.

372
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.046
Because?

373
00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:21.505
Discipline in here equals
success out there.

374
00:22:21.591 --> 00:22:22.956
That's exactly right.

375
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:25.092
What we're doing
is helping them.

376
00:22:25.178 --> 00:22:27.136
We are giving them the tough
love that they needed

377
00:22:27.263 --> 00:22:29.180
and they never got at home.

378
00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:32.058
Adams is going to be just fine.

379
00:22:32.143 --> 00:22:33.851
Okay.

380
00:22:40.234 --> 00:22:42.068
Under your pillow.

381
00:22:43.404 --> 00:22:45.154
It's all I could sneak out.

382
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:46.989
Thanks.

383
00:22:48.493 --> 00:22:50.818
You gotta drop
the parents thing.

384
00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:52.745
Trust me.

385
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.823
You've been in a place
like this?

386
00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:56.916
Four?

387
00:22:57.001 --> 00:22:59.543
I just loved the first three
so much.

388
00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:05.666
You think I'm crazy now. huh?

389
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.842
I didn't say that.

390
00:23:06.969 --> 00:23:08.886
You didn't have to.

391
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:12.431
Gonna want to work on
your poker face in here. rookie.

392
00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:18.020
Well?

393
00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:21.014
Are you?

394
00:23:21.109 --> 00:23:24.276
Crazy?

395
00:23:24.362 --> 00:23:28.072
In a place like this
nobody's a perfect angel.

396
00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:31.367
Not even you.

397
00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:33.369
That's not what I meant.

398
00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:38.040
[sighs]

399
00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:41.419
My mom had me real young.

400
00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:42.795
Not that much older
than we are now

401
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.213
and it just messed everything
up for her.

402
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.548
My dad split when I was born.

403
00:23:45.675 --> 00:23:48.384
leaving just me there
to soak up all her anger.

404
00:23:48.511 --> 00:23:49.760
She's hated me my whole life.

405
00:23:49.846 --> 00:23:52.880
She lies about me. says
I did things I didn't do.

406
00:23:52.974 --> 00:23:54.882
I think she just wanted people
to feel sorry for her

407
00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:58.602
for having such
a screwed up kid.

408
00:23:58.688 --> 00:23:59.770
Jeez.

409
00:23:59.856 --> 00:24:01.889
That's awful. I'm... I'm sorry.

410
00:24:01.983 --> 00:24:02.890
Don't get me wrong.

411
00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:04.400
I've done some really
stupid shit.

412
00:24:04.527 --> 00:24:07.278
My brain's definitely
not normal. you know?

413
00:24:07.363 --> 00:24:08.779
I've got anger issues.

414
00:24:08.865 --> 00:24:10.406
Big time mood swings.

415
00:24:10.533 --> 00:24:13.784
But. like. I can't remember
who I was when I was little.

416
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.569
It's like the chicken
or the egg thing.

417
00:24:15.663 --> 00:24:16.996
Was I messed up
before these places

418
00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:20.207
or did these places
mess me up?

419
00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:23.127
I can't even tell anymore.

420
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:26.005
How do you know
all of that?

421
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.591
A lot of therapy.

422
00:24:28.718 --> 00:24:30.551
If my mom knew that I was
in a place like this

423
00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:33.420
she'd come and take me home
in a minute.

424
00:24:33.514 --> 00:24:34.430
Yeah?

425
00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:36.474
You sure about that?

426
00:24:37.602 --> 00:24:40.478
First centre I was at they
woke me up at 3:00A.M.

427
00:24:40.563 --> 00:24:42.104
Dragged me out of bed.
screaming.

428
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:45.149
I thought I was being kidnapped
until I saw Mommy there.

429
00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:47.526
just watching it all.

430
00:24:53.534 --> 00:24:57.778
Hey... you've gotta find
something to focus on.

431
00:24:57.872 --> 00:25:00.113
Your guiding star.

432
00:25:00.208 --> 00:25:02.249
For me it's 18.

433
00:25:02.335 --> 00:25:04.502
When I turn 18.
I'm outta here.

434
00:25:04.587 --> 00:25:09.465
I can go anywhere. be anything.
and nobody can stop me.

435
00:25:09.592 --> 00:25:11.800
Ten months and I'm free.

436
00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:17.389
What's your star?

437
00:25:22.146 --> 00:25:24.355
I don't know.

438
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.190
Better find one.

439
00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:29.142
Otherwise this place
will chew you up.

440
00:25:29.237 --> 00:25:31.028
Or just fake it
'til you make it.

441
00:25:31.113 --> 00:25:32.863
Voice: Shut down!

442
00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:38.994
What's this Investment place?

443
00:25:39.121 --> 00:25:40.746
You gotta listen better.

444
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:43.165
Listen?

445
00:25:43.292 --> 00:25:44.542
We're not even allowed to talk.

446
00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:46.085
Oh. there's talking.

447
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.629
You just gotta be all ears.

448
00:25:48.714 --> 00:25:50.998
The Investment Unit
sounds like solitary.

449
00:25:51.092 --> 00:25:52.332
They keep you alone
in a classroom

450
00:25:52.426 --> 00:25:53.759
doing homework for days.

451
00:25:53.844 --> 00:25:55.553
It's not too bad.

452
00:25:55.638 --> 00:25:59.223
Obs is what you want to avoid.

453
00:25:59.308 --> 00:26:00.099
Obs?

454
00:26:00.184 --> 00:26:01.433
Observation room.

455
00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:03.769
I heard the girls talking
about it at dinner.

456
00:26:03.854 --> 00:26:05.512
Like a cinder block cell.

457
00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:08.691
They throw you in there.
maybe with clothes.

458
00:26:08.818 --> 00:26:10.734
maybe without.

459
00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:11.852
Yeah.

460
00:26:11.946 --> 00:26:14.655
Our very own Guantanamo. baby.

461
00:26:15.658 --> 00:26:17.616
'Night.

462
00:26:37.513 --> 00:26:40.097
I like where you're going
with this. Kayla.

463
00:26:40.182 --> 00:26:42.349
Let's talk after class.
okay?

464
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.896
[bell rings]

465
00:26:48.024 --> 00:26:50.524
Remember. reports due Friday!

466
00:27:02.872 --> 00:27:04.079
Kayla...

467
00:27:04.206 --> 00:27:06.874
So how are you doing?
Overall.

468
00:27:09.378 --> 00:27:12.087
I know it can be
a hard adjustment.

469
00:27:12.214 --> 00:27:14.247
Lots of rules.

470
00:27:14.342 --> 00:27:16.416
But you'll get used to it.

471
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.584
I hope so.

472
00:27:17.678 --> 00:27:19.428
You're a smart girl.

473
00:27:19.555 --> 00:27:22.589
Has anybody ever talked to you
about dyslexia?

474
00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:24.725
Do you know the term?

475
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.061
It's a learning disability

476
00:27:27.146 --> 00:27:29.730
that has absolutely nothing
to do with intelligence.

477
00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:33.767
It can just. you know.
mix up some of the letters.

478
00:27:33.861 --> 00:27:35.611
Switch them around.

479
00:27:35.738 --> 00:27:39.198
It makes it harder to. uh.
read or spell.

480
00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:44.111
Even though you know exactly
what you want to say.

481
00:27:44.205 --> 00:27:45.454
I thought I was just stupid.

482
00:27:45.581 --> 00:27:47.748
No. you are definitely
not stupid.

483
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.282
Do me a favor.

484
00:27:49.377 --> 00:27:51.251
Take a look at the board real
quick and then back at me.

485
00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:56.840
Can you tell me what
word's on top?

486
00:27:56.926 --> 00:27:58.717
Cat or cot?

487
00:28:05.643 --> 00:28:07.810
Alright. it's okay.
It's alright.

488
00:28:07.937 --> 00:28:11.972
Next week we will do the full
test and then go from there.

489
00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:13.107
Okay?

490
00:28:15.778 --> 00:28:17.194
Thank you.

491
00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.478
Good.

492
00:28:18.572 --> 00:28:22.282
Um. sir. can I ask you
a question?

493
00:28:22.368 --> 00:28:24.076
Yeah.

494
00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:27.487
Um. do you know about
this place?

495
00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:29.915
I'm not sure I know
what you mean.

496
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.500
Like how they treat us.

497
00:28:31.627 --> 00:28:33.001
My first day I saw a girl
get tackled-

498
00:28:33.129 --> 00:28:36.046
Kayla. it's not my job
to supervise

499
00:28:36.132 --> 00:28:38.665
anything outside this classroom.

500
00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:40.000
But don't you care-

501
00:28:40.094 --> 00:28:41.677
I do know that there's likely
a very good reason

502
00:28:41.804 --> 00:28:43.679
why you're here.

503
00:28:44.807 --> 00:28:46.557
You want my advice?

504
00:28:49.812 --> 00:28:52.354
Just keep your nose clean
and do as you're told.

505
00:28:52.481 --> 00:28:55.182
Now. I need to get back
to grading

506
00:28:55.276 --> 00:28:57.359
and you should get to class.

507
00:28:59.655 --> 00:29:02.865
Bryce: Nevertheless.
because those miracles

508
00:29:02.992 --> 00:29:05.451
were worked by small means.

509
00:29:05.536 --> 00:29:09.997
It did show unto them
marvelous works.

510
00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:14.126
The show of their countenance
doth witness against them

511
00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:18.464
and doth declare their sin
to be even as sodden

512
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:20.299
And they cannot hide it.

513
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:25.804
Thank you. Bryce. Okay. girls.
time for achievements.

514
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:30.434
Anderson. Perez.
Lewis and Garcia.

515
00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:33.020
TV privileges next week.

516
00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:35.230
Torres and Green.

517
00:29:35.357 --> 00:29:37.775
You get to go to the library.

518
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.361
Uh. Scheff... you get
a phone call.

519
00:29:41.447 --> 00:29:45.157
And Adams. let's see here...
hmm.

520
00:29:45.242 --> 00:29:49.745
Looks like Adams was
spreading lies and negativity

521
00:29:49.872 --> 00:29:51.246
as she was making up stories

522
00:29:51.373 --> 00:29:53.332
that she told her teacher
during class.

523
00:29:53.417 --> 00:29:54.458
What? No. I...

524
00:29:54.543 --> 00:29:56.960
And as a result.

525
00:29:57.046 --> 00:30:00.714
I'm sorry. but there are no
phone privileges for a month.

526
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.090
That's not fair.

527
00:30:02.218 --> 00:30:04.968
Everything that is concealed
will be brought to light

528
00:30:05.054 --> 00:30:06.428
and made known to all.

529
00:30:06.555 --> 00:30:10.265
You know. you are
a very lucky girl.

530
00:30:10.392 --> 00:30:12.851
I happen to be in a fantastic
mood this week.

531
00:30:12.937 --> 00:30:16.313
Otherwise. the consequences
for what you did would be

532
00:30:16.398 --> 00:30:19.608
a week on the Investment Unit.
Isn't that right. girls?

533
00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:20.818
All: Yes. Miss Connie.

534
00:30:20.903 --> 00:30:23.654
And for upholding
the rules here.

535
00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:27.366
Fry has earned herself a trip
to the drive-thru.

536
00:30:27.451 --> 00:30:29.609
Isn't that great?

537
00:30:29.703 --> 00:30:31.203
Snitch.

538
00:30:32.248 --> 00:30:34.039
What did you call me?

539
00:30:34.124 --> 00:30:36.333
Get up. Say it again
to my face!

540
00:30:36.418 --> 00:30:37.668
-Hey!
-Do it again. I dare you!

541
00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:38.794
Hey.

542
00:30:39.463 --> 00:30:40.954
[gasps]

543
00:30:41.757 --> 00:30:43.790
Miss Connie. don't dial nine!
I lost my head.

544
00:30:43.884 --> 00:30:45.592
I promise I won't do it again.

545
00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:50.556
And what do you think would be
an appropriate consequence

546
00:30:50.641 --> 00:30:52.391
for that behavior?

547
00:30:52.476 --> 00:30:54.226
No drive-thru.

548
00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:55.519
And?

549
00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:57.104
Investment.

550
00:30:57.189 --> 00:30:59.356
For how long?

551
00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:00.983
Three days.

552
00:31:02.736 --> 00:31:04.820
A week.

553
00:31:04.947 --> 00:31:06.238
Go.

554
00:31:06.323 --> 00:31:07.781
Now!

555
00:31:11.245 --> 00:31:12.819
Stand up.

556
00:31:12.913 --> 00:31:16.823
I know you started this and
I'm not going to forget that.

557
00:31:16.917 --> 00:31:18.709
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

558
00:31:18.794 --> 00:31:21.661
You know you are
a very nasty girl

559
00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:25.382
who thinks you're smarter
than everybody else.

560
00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:27.384
No. I'm not.

561
00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:29.928
Well. it's true.
That's why you're here.

562
00:31:30.014 --> 00:31:31.221
That's why your mom
sent you here

563
00:31:31.307 --> 00:31:35.508
because she knows
who you are.

564
00:31:35.603 --> 00:31:38.937
So. I'd like to hear you say it.

565
00:31:39.023 --> 00:31:41.773
I'm a nasty girl and
I deserve to be here.

566
00:31:41.859 --> 00:31:43.516
Louder.

567
00:31:43.611 --> 00:31:46.653
I'm a nasty girl and I
deserve to be here.

568
00:31:46.739 --> 00:31:48.780
Again.

569
00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:52.451
I'm a nasty girl and I
deserve to be here.

570
00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:02.586
All the days just
blur together here.

571
00:32:02.671 --> 00:32:04.922
It's freaky.

572
00:32:05.007 --> 00:32:07.040
I don't even know how long
we've been here.

573
00:32:07.134 --> 00:32:08.091
We've been here
for three months.

574
00:32:08.177 --> 00:32:10.010
one week and two days.

575
00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:17.726
How do you know all of that?

576
00:32:17.853 --> 00:32:19.144
Gotta pay attention.
Adams.

577
00:32:19.229 --> 00:32:21.772
They want you to get
used to this.

578
00:32:21.857 --> 00:32:24.274
My guiding star. Remember?

579
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.403
I turn 18 in six months.
three weeks and five days.

580
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:30.238
That's why I count.

581
00:32:33.535 --> 00:32:36.078
I just don't have
a guiding star.

582
00:32:36.205 --> 00:32:39.790
Well. stop moping around.
Maybe you'll find it.

583
00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:48.757
Miss Torres.

584
00:32:54.223 --> 00:32:55.806
Good.

585
00:32:57.393 --> 00:33:00.060
Ah. Miss Scheff.
Welcome.

586
00:33:02.356 --> 00:33:03.480
Okay.

587
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.775
Okay.

588
00:33:06.902 --> 00:33:09.778
Harris. It's your turn to share.

589
00:33:21.125 --> 00:33:23.750
My older brother.
Andrew. he...

590
00:33:23.836 --> 00:33:28.380
Louder please.
We can't hear you.

591
00:33:30.884 --> 00:33:36.805
My brother. Andrew.
has this friend. Kevin.

592
00:33:36.932 --> 00:33:41.852
and Kevin used to come over
every day after school

593
00:33:41.937 --> 00:33:45.689
to play video games.

594
00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:47.399
I would make them
bagel bites sometimes

595
00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:49.443
when they would get hungry.

596
00:33:54.450 --> 00:34:00.245
One time. um. I went in the
kitchen and Kevin followed me.

597
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.205
Andrew was in the bathroom
or something. I don't know.

598
00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:10.213
But Kevin was there and he...
pulled down my shorts and...

599
00:34:13.302 --> 00:34:15.177
Finish the share.

600
00:34:15.304 --> 00:34:17.679
This is for the benefit
of the group.

601
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:27.647
He pulled down my shorts and he
jammed his fingers inside of me.

602
00:34:27.733 --> 00:34:31.401
And it hurt really bad.

603
00:34:31.487 --> 00:34:34.780
And I heard him
tell my brother.

604
00:34:34.865 --> 00:34:39.910
Andrew didn't look at me
for a month.

605
00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:43.789
Great. Let's hear some feedback
from the group. please.

606
00:34:43.874 --> 00:34:45.865
How short were your shorts?

607
00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:47.084
Yes. Good.

608
00:34:47.169 --> 00:34:50.703
What was your participation
in the event?

609
00:34:50.798 --> 00:34:52.255
You must've said something
to him.

610
00:34:52.341 --> 00:34:54.382
Like something flirty to make
him think you were into it.

611
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:55.759
Very good.

612
00:34:55.844 --> 00:34:58.929
And in what way were you giving
Kevin mixed signals?

613
00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:03.308
Maybe you were trying
to tempt him?

614
00:35:03.393 --> 00:35:07.771
Resist the devil and he will
flee from you.

615
00:35:07.856 --> 00:35:10.148
Court him and you will
have shackles.

616
00:35:10.234 --> 00:35:15.728
Not on your wrist
but on your soul.

617
00:35:15.823 --> 00:35:18.073
Don't duck under accountability.

618
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.244
You are not a victim.
Tears are just an escape.

619
00:35:22.371 --> 00:35:24.704
Face your flaws.

620
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.123
Adams.

621
00:35:28.043 --> 00:35:30.252
Let's hear some feedback.

622
00:35:34.216 --> 00:35:35.757
This is the third time

623
00:35:35.884 --> 00:35:40.345
you've refused to participate
in group therapy.

624
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:41.888
I'm gonna have to report you
to Miss Connie

625
00:35:41.974 --> 00:35:44.057
if things don't change.

626
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.192
[knocking]

627
00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.281
Oh. I didn't know we were
allowed in each other's rooms.

628
00:35:59.408 --> 00:36:00.657
We're not.

629
00:36:00.742 --> 00:36:02.993
Staff said that you weren't
opening up

630
00:36:03.078 --> 00:36:05.954
and they offered me leadership
points to talk to you.

631
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.501
So. you're just here
for privileges?

632
00:36:11.587 --> 00:36:13.587
No. uh. it's a bonus.

633
00:36:13.672 --> 00:36:16.673
I... I wanted to see
you anyways.

634
00:36:16.758 --> 00:36:19.384
You know. I've been thinking
about you.

635
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:23.430
And... like. how
you've been doing.

636
00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:27.058
Well. invite the girl in.

637
00:36:27.144 --> 00:36:29.436
Oh. yeah. yeah... here.

638
00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:39.779
So. how long have you been
at Appaloosa?

639
00:36:39.865 --> 00:36:42.657
Almost a year.

640
00:36:42.784 --> 00:36:46.995
Does it get any easier?

641
00:36:47.122 --> 00:36:49.372
That depends what
you mean by "easy".

642
00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:51.491
I feel like I'm in jail.

643
00:36:51.585 --> 00:36:54.252
You have to find things
to look forward to.

644
00:36:54.338 --> 00:36:56.254
Things that they can't take.

645
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.506
Yeah. that's what Amanda
was saying

646
00:36:58.634 --> 00:37:00.592
that I have to find a guiding
star. you know.

647
00:37:00.677 --> 00:37:04.137
something to think about
while I'm in here.

648
00:37:04.223 --> 00:37:06.681
Until I'm out.

649
00:37:06.808 --> 00:37:08.725
I like that.

650
00:37:10.771 --> 00:37:11.811
-Scheff?
-[knocks]

651
00:37:13.732 --> 00:37:15.607
You've got a family call.

652
00:37:18.612 --> 00:37:21.196
Martinez. Back
in your room in 10.

653
00:37:27.079 --> 00:37:28.912
I think it's pretty cool that
you didn't give feedback

654
00:37:28.997 --> 00:37:31.248
to Ashley.

655
00:37:31.333 --> 00:37:33.416
Well. yeah. Poor girl.

656
00:37:33.502 --> 00:37:36.703
It's not her fault that
that happened to her.

657
00:37:36.797 --> 00:37:39.372
No. of course not.

658
00:37:39.466 --> 00:37:42.217
Everybody just kind of goes
with it here.

659
00:37:42.344 --> 00:37:45.512
I thought it was pretty brave
that you refused.

660
00:37:50.435 --> 00:37:54.312
It's pretty hard to be brave
in a place like this.

661
00:37:54.398 --> 00:37:55.438
Yeah.

662
00:37:59.111 --> 00:38:01.561
Wait for it to ring.
You don't dial out.

663
00:38:01.655 --> 00:38:02.904
If you dial out.
we cut the call.

664
00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:04.063
you get a consequence.

665
00:38:04.157 --> 00:38:05.398
I know the rules by now.

666
00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:07.534
I have to say them every time.

667
00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:09.619
Careful.

668
00:38:09.705 --> 00:38:11.913
No talk of the past.

669
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.292
I know. Keep it in the present.

670
00:38:24.553 --> 00:38:26.261
I'll be back in 20.

671
00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:35.520
[ringing]

672
00:38:35.605 --> 00:38:37.022
-Hello?
-Hey Panda.

673
00:38:37.107 --> 00:38:38.931
Hey Mom.

674
00:38:39.026 --> 00:38:40.650
-Getting ready for work?
-Yeah.

675
00:38:40.736 --> 00:38:42.769
I only got a minute.
You doing okay?

676
00:38:42.863 --> 00:38:43.862
Yeah. I'm fine.

677
00:38:43.947 --> 00:38:45.196
What are they feeding you
out there?

678
00:38:45.282 --> 00:38:46.448
Anything good?

679
00:38:46.575 --> 00:38:47.615
Same shit as always.

680
00:38:47.743 --> 00:38:49.275
You know I don't like it
when you swear.

681
00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:50.452
Where do you think
I learned it?

682
00:38:50.579 --> 00:38:52.162
Oh right. this is my fault.

683
00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:54.831
'Cause everything
is always my fault.

684
00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:59.252
Forget it. forget it. forget it.
Um... how's Jason?

685
00:38:59.338 --> 00:39:01.621
Uh... Jason's doing fine.

686
00:39:01.715 --> 00:39:05.467
He's outside skateboarding
near every chance he gets.

687
00:39:05.594 --> 00:39:06.801
A little Tony Hawk.

688
00:39:06.928 --> 00:39:08.127
He wears a helmet and pads.
right?

689
00:39:08.221 --> 00:39:09.629
Of course he does.

690
00:39:09.723 --> 00:39:11.389
God. You really think I'm
a terrible mother. don't you?

691
00:39:11.475 --> 00:39:13.475
I was just asking.

692
00:39:13.602 --> 00:39:15.852
Because raising kids is so easy.

693
00:39:15.937 --> 00:39:18.521
Can't wait 'til it's your turn.

694
00:39:18.607 --> 00:39:22.108
Okay. um... how's what's
his name... Steve?

695
00:39:22.194 --> 00:39:24.194
Long gone. He split
last month.

696
00:39:24.279 --> 00:39:27.405
Sorry. Mom. I... I knew
you liked him.

697
00:39:27.491 --> 00:39:29.908
Yeah. you don't know
nothing about anything.

698
00:39:29.993 --> 00:39:31.701
Liking someone ain't enough.

699
00:39:31.787 --> 00:39:33.745
Look. I gotta go. Okay?

700
00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:35.663
So... stay out of trouble.

701
00:39:35.791 --> 00:39:38.416
-I miss you...
-[dial tone]

702
00:39:47.803 --> 00:39:51.504
Seems like you and your mother
have a history.

703
00:39:51.598 --> 00:39:54.006
I love my mother very much.

704
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:59.345
You know. I used to be mad
at my mother all the time.

705
00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:01.564
Was she mean to you?

706
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:04.401
I thought so at the time
but then I grew up

707
00:40:04.486 --> 00:40:07.353
and I realized she was
just trying to help me.

708
00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:09.447
Just trying to make me stronger.

709
00:40:09.533 --> 00:40:12.492
Like a 'break you down.
build you up' sort of thing.

710
00:40:14.538 --> 00:40:17.205
You are a very smart girl.

711
00:40:17.332 --> 00:40:21.292
And I am sure that all of
our rules here drive you crazy.

712
00:40:21.378 --> 00:40:23.711
But if you just follow
the rules.

713
00:40:23.839 --> 00:40:24.838
every last one of them.

714
00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:27.882
you are going to make it
out there.

715
00:40:28.009 --> 00:40:29.509
You really believe that?

716
00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:31.261
I do.

717
00:40:33.014 --> 00:40:34.514
Room checks!

718
00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:36.641
Lights out in 10.

719
00:40:48.363 --> 00:40:49.863
Hey. that's for me.

720
00:41:11.553 --> 00:41:12.760
Ow!

721
00:41:12.888 --> 00:41:14.420
Do you think I'm blind?

722
00:41:14.514 --> 00:41:16.181
I forgot it was there
from class!

723
00:41:16.266 --> 00:41:17.974
Did I give you permission
to speak?

724
00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:21.060
You just asked me
a question!

725
00:41:21.146 --> 00:41:23.429
And you have just gotten
yourself some time

726
00:41:23.523 --> 00:41:26.274
on the Investment Unit.
Go!

727
00:42:03.563 --> 00:42:06.397
You don't seem very happy.
Kayla.

728
00:42:06.483 --> 00:42:08.316
Happy?

729
00:42:08.443 --> 00:42:12.320
How could anyone be happy
in a place like this?

730
00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:16.533
Why don't you tell me about
the school you were at before.

731
00:42:19.412 --> 00:42:21.320
It sucked.

732
00:42:21.414 --> 00:42:23.656
I was failing all my classes

733
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:28.378
and these boys used to bully me.
like. every day.

734
00:42:28.463 --> 00:42:31.664
And what did they say?

735
00:42:31.758 --> 00:42:34.467
Made fun of the way I dressed.

736
00:42:34.553 --> 00:42:37.169
Called me stupid.

737
00:42:37.264 --> 00:42:40.006
Did you tell your parents?

738
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.891
I tried.

739
00:42:41.977 --> 00:42:44.060
And?

740
00:42:44.145 --> 00:42:49.274
My step-dad said to ignore them
because 'boys will be boys'.

741
00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:51.025
And my mom's...

742
00:42:53.321 --> 00:42:55.905
Tell me what you're feeling.

743
00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:02.245
I feel like no one believes me.

744
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:05.081
I tried to tell my teachers
that I see letters.

745
00:43:05.166 --> 00:43:07.533
um. different. and then
they just said

746
00:43:07.627 --> 00:43:09.869
that I wasn't trying
hard enough.

747
00:43:09.963 --> 00:43:13.298
My mom was just like.

748
00:43:13.383 --> 00:43:15.708
"Maybe the boys are just
flirting with you.

749
00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:17.677
"Did you ever think about that?"

750
00:43:22.684 --> 00:43:24.884
It was like I tried to tell
the adults in my life

751
00:43:24.978 --> 00:43:26.561
what's going on and then
they just think

752
00:43:26.688 --> 00:43:29.522
that I'm some liar.

753
00:43:29.608 --> 00:43:32.275
I'm like a sneaky little liar
and then I come here

754
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.610
and oh. my God.

755
00:43:33.695 --> 00:43:34.736
everyone's constantly
telling me that it's true.

756
00:43:34.863 --> 00:43:36.904
That I am an addict.
that I am a liar

757
00:43:37.032 --> 00:43:38.573
and that I'm just
a bad person.

758
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:43.578
And then... then I'm just.
like. scared.

759
00:43:43.705 --> 00:43:50.251
I'm just. like. so scared
that maybe...

760
00:43:50.378 --> 00:43:52.962
maybe deep down
they're right.

761
00:43:53.048 --> 00:43:56.507
Maybe my parents shouldn't
believe me.

762
00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:04.515
Maybe I am a terrible person.

763
00:44:06.895 --> 00:44:10.930
Thank you for telling me
how you feel.

764
00:44:11.024 --> 00:44:13.775
You don't think I'm bad?

765
00:44:13.902 --> 00:44:15.902
No. Kayla.

766
00:44:15.987 --> 00:44:17.487
I think you're having
trouble processing

767
00:44:17.572 --> 00:44:22.108
everything you're feeling but
you're doing the best you can.

768
00:44:22.202 --> 00:44:25.578
And I'm going to help you.

769
00:44:25.664 --> 00:44:27.830
If you let me.

Teacher: Starting with the line
segment already provided.

771
00:44:34.422 --> 00:44:38.132
We're going to continue
constructing our polygon

772
00:44:38.259 --> 00:44:40.885
using a series of similar edges.

773
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:46.683
Now. measuring from...

Security needed in Classroom 4!

777
00:45:06.663 --> 00:45:09.038
Security in Classroom 4!

Booty juice! Booty juice!
Booty juice!

Teacher: We need the nurse
to the math class right away!

781
00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:25.680
I just want everyone
to know that Green

782
00:45:25.807 --> 00:45:27.673
is going to be just fine.

783
00:45:27.767 --> 00:45:29.976
She's in the nurse's unit
and she'll be back soon.

784
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:32.678
It looked much worse
than it actually was.

785
00:45:32.772 --> 00:45:33.896
Permission to speak.

786
00:45:33.982 --> 00:45:35.181
Yes. Torres?

What about Lindsay?

But first... what the hell
is booty juice?

815

You have been here
how long now?

816
00:47:30.098 --> 00:47:32.631
Five months and three days.

817
00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:34.225
And yet you don't know
what booty juice is

818
00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:35.601
after five months.

819
00:47:35.687 --> 00:47:39.397

the girls talk about it.

Haldol.

821
00:47:40.608 --> 00:47:42.400
It's an antipsychotic
and sedative.

Knocks you out stone cold.

Oh. you've had it before?

824
00:47:45.446 --> 00:47:47.697
Yup. Shoot you right here.

825
00:47:47.782 --> 00:47:50.324
That's why they call it
"booty juice".

826
00:47:50.451 --> 00:47:52.368
That can't be legal.

827
00:47:52.453 --> 00:47:53.995
Girl. you've been
paying attention.

828
00:47:54.122 --> 00:47:55.830
all this ain't legal.

829
00:47:58.042 --> 00:47:59.166
Yeah.

00:48:04.924 --> 00:48:07.592
This is the longest I've gone
without talking to my mom.

Well. then relax and enjoy.

00:48:09.804 --> 00:48:11.596
Why can't I talk to them
in private.

833
00:48:11.681 --> 00:48:13.055
like Amanda does?

834
00:48:13.141 --> 00:48:15.683
Well. remember everyone here
is on a different timeline.

835
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:17.602
And the staff determines if
you've earned that privilege.

836
00:48:17.687 --> 00:48:18.853
not me.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.680
But let's start here
and if all goes well

This is Doctor Jameson.
we spoke last week.

I have Kayla here with me and
she's very eager to say hello.

Hi honey!

846
00:48:41.669 --> 00:48:44.420
It feels so good
to hear your voice.

847
00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:45.204
Yours too.

00:48:45.298 --> 00:48:46.297
Hi Kay.

00:48:46.382 --> 00:48:47.882
Hey Ray.

850
00:48:48.009 --> 00:48:49.550
We've been trying to get in
touch with you for a while.

851
00:48:49.677 --> 00:48:51.877
honey. but I guess
somebody's having too
much fun to talk. huh?

852
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:53.429
Mm-hmm.

853
00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:55.848
Here at Appaloosa it takes time
for the students

854
00:48:55.934 --> 00:48:58.217
to earn phone privileges.

855
00:48:58.311 --> 00:49:00.895
They're each on
a different path.

00:49:01.022 --> 00:49:04.482
Well. what you been up to?
You been horseback riding yet?

Uh... no.

in that pool. girl.

It's terrible here.

they scream at us.

00:49:22.251 --> 00:49:23.626
and this girl got stabbed!
By a-

00:49:33.471 --> 00:49:34.920
Yes. it's Doctor Jameson.

865
00:49:35.014 --> 00:49:37.589
I'm very sorry but as
we warned you last week.

866
00:49:37.684 --> 00:49:39.266
Kayla is concocting
these stories

867
00:49:39.394 --> 00:49:41.102
to try to manipulate you.

868
00:49:41.229 --> 00:49:44.897
To make you feel guilty
so you'll come get her.

869
00:49:44.983 --> 00:49:46.983
No. No one was stabbed.

870
00:49:47.068 --> 00:49:48.776
There's no need for concern.
really.

871
00:49:48.903 --> 00:49:50.778
This is a common tactic.

872
00:49:50.905 --> 00:49:52.613
The important thing is we stick
to the program.

873
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.774
Now. Kayla is doing
very well here.

874
00:49:55.868 --> 00:49:57.785
She's taking time to adjust
to the full program

875
00:49:57.912 --> 00:50:00.329
but that's completely normal.

876
00:50:00.415 --> 00:50:01.414

in you.

to do anything like that again

1066
01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:37.702
I wished that we could get
in a car.

1067
01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:41.840
just you and me. and we can
just... take off.

1068

Where we going?

1069

You've got anger issues.

1079

You don't even try
to get better.

1080
01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.959
It's like you're more
comfortable in here

1081
01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:19.494
than you are out there.

1082
01:03:19.588 --> 01:03:21.004
It's really sad.

Adams. Yeah. excellent!
Way to volunteer.

1088
01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:38.179
You act like you don't
belong here.

1089
01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:40.315
Like you're better
than everyone.

1090
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.275
Like your shit don't stink.

1091
01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:45.529
No one feels safe around you

1092
01:03:45.656 --> 01:03:47.364
'cause we know what
you're really thinking.

1093
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.282
You're a pervert and if you ever
try to touch me...

No threats. please.

We're giving Adams feedback

about herself.

1097
01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:58.291
Okay. my feedback is to ask
God to straighten you out.

1098

Thank you.

1109
01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:19.980
You know. in the brochure

1110
01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:22.774
it said that there was a heated
swimming pool?

1111
01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:27.279
Oh yeah. it is. uh... under
construction for the winter.

1112
01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:30.657

can have a little time together.

We want you to know how proud
we are of you.

1120
01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:58.351
I've been making up lots
of ground and learning

1121

stick to what's been working?

Mmmhmm.

1126
01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:20.949
Nice to see your parents?

Not a clue.

No.

At least they came
to see you.

1132
01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.971
I don't even know what to say
to them anymore.

1133
01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:36.848
You know. like. they don't
trust me to tell the truth

1134
01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:38.558
and I don't trust them
to believe me.

1135

just sitting there.

something really wise.

Ms. Scheff. hello.

01:16:05.979 --> 01:16:08.437
I would love an explanation as
to why somebody was calling me

1315
01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:11.941
late last night. screaming
about my daughter dying?

1316
01:16:12.026 --> 01:16:13.818
And why it's taken me hours
to get through to you.

I am so sorry.

1318
01:16:15.655 --> 01:16:17.613
One of the students got into
the phone room last night.

1319
01:16:17.699 --> 01:16:20.908
They're just trying to cause
as much trouble as possible

1320
01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:22.577
and making things up
to get attention.

1321
01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:24.036
Well. she certainly got mine.

1322
01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:26.831
I can assure you Ms. Scheff.
Amanda is doing just fine.

1323
01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:29.125
I would like to talk to her.

1324
01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:33.212
Unfortunately. she is in group
therapy at the moment

1325
01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:36.507
and it is not possible to take
her out in the middle.

1326
01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:38.467
Well. then have her call me
when she's done.

1327
01:16:38.553 --> 01:16:40.886
Um. Amanda has a very full day.

1328
01:16:41.014 --> 01:16:43.306
So perhaps she could call you
later this week?

1329
01:16:43.391 --> 01:16:46.309
Look. I know my kid
ain't no angel. alright?

1330
01:16:46.394 --> 01:16:48.561
But what kind of a school
is this

1331
01:16:48.688 --> 01:16:52.231
that I don't get to talk to
my own kid when I want to?

1332
01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:54.567
Put her on the phone... now!

1333
01:16:54.694 --> 01:16:58.729
I'm sorry Ms. Scheff.
it's just not possible.

plane and I'm coming out there.

but if you won't let me talk

1336

to my daughter then
I am coming to her.

1337

And if she's not okay
when I get there.

1338
01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:10.458

she has to family right now.

She's like one of my own.

1343
01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:35.775
Then how'd you let her get so
sick before calling for help?

These girls fake being sick
all the time.

she was this sick?

01:17:52.085 --> 01:17:53.125
We did.

1351
01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:54.669
You said she was faking.
