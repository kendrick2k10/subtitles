3
00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.059
I remember that.

4
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.978
Yeah. you remember that?

5
00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.835
Aubrey was like. she had a dream.

6
00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:42.420
I'm like. "What was the dream?"

7
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.089
She had a dream that I was in jail.

8
00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.139
Every morning I take her to school.

9
00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.809
One morning
I wasn't there to take her to school.

10
00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.020
That was the morning I was arrested.

11
00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:04.317
I wish I'd have slept with her that night.

12
00:14:08.722 --> 00:14:09.682
Hello!

13
00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:14.478
You know. I definitely can't wait for
the father-daughter dance

14
00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:15.896
on June 1st.

15
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.608
Yeah. What's going on down there?

16
01:00:59.405 --> 01:01:00.615
I didn't even know that was you

17
01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:02.241
when I seen you coming through.

18
01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:04.744
Your hair was just so pretty. I think…

19
01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.120
You didn't know who I was?

20
01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:08.206
I didn't.
'Cause you had your hair blown out.

21
01:01:08.289 --> 01:01:10.249
I didn't know that was you
'cause it's looking different.

22
01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.876
Like you see Daddy bald head.

23
01:01:11.959 --> 01:01:13.586
But I knew who you were.

24
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.004
so I just ran to you.

25
01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:16.047
Yeah. yeah.

26
01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:18.341
If I run to you…

27
01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:21.344
if I look different.
and I don't look like Aubrey.

28
01:01:21.427 --> 01:01:23.721
-and I run to you. I'm Aubrey.
-Yeah. you're right.

29
01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:25.056
Okay.

30
01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:35.168
Not flash. That one was flash.

31
01:02:36.377 --> 01:02:38.755
Hold on. did you get this one working?

32
01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:45.219
It doesn't work when you…

33
01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:46.971
No. they don't work…

34
01:02:47.054 --> 01:02:48.514
The flash ain't on.

35
01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.600
You gotta…
You gotta wind it.

36
01:02:57.064 --> 01:02:59.901
This pink matches my color.

37
01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.827
We learnin' about new songs like...

38
01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:13.790
We are family

39
01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:16.334
Come on everybody with…

40
01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:20.630
I don't know how to say it.

41
01:03:26.844 --> 01:03:28.513
We are a family…

42
01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:46.168
So. what is this whole big building?

43
01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:48.504
Um. it's. uh. it's like a gym.

44
01:06:48.587 --> 01:06:50.297
It's where we come play basketball.

45
01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:52.133
Y'all could play basketball?

46
01:06:52.216 --> 01:06:53.050
Yeah.

47
01:06:54.051 --> 01:06:54.885
Yep.

48
01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:57.596
Like y'all go to the gym at school.

49
01:06:58.097 --> 01:06:59.098
That's how it be.

50
01:06:59.765 --> 01:07:02.476
We go outside and play basketball.

51
01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.145
or we come in the gym.

52
01:07:04.228 --> 01:07:05.855
When you get out?

53
01:07:05.938 --> 01:07:09.233
Um. I don't know. I'm hopin' I…

54
01:07:09.316 --> 01:07:11.986
I'm supposed to go to court July 16th.

55
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:14.613
You said you were
supposed to go to court last Monday…

56
01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.282
I know. but they pushed it off.

57
01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:19.201
They pushed it…
I was supposed to go May the 7th.

58
01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:20.411
They pushed it off.

59
01:09:22.074 --> 01:09:24.702
It's wrong. You don't really…

60
01:09:24.785 --> 01:09:27.163
She don't make me think that you start it.

61
01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:29.248
I think she be startin' it sometimes.

62
01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:31.458
And I think
she just want something to fight about.

63
01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:33.627
-And I think the same about you.
-It's okay.

64
01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:35.713
What I'm saying is.
y'all shouldn't do that.

65
01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:36.839
You ain't gotta worry 'bout it no more.

66
01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.849
We're not gonna
be able to visit you anymore?

67
01:12:33.932 --> 01:12:36.435
Yeah. you can still visit me.
Why do you say that?

68
01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:37.895
But where are you going?

69
01:12:37.978 --> 01:12:38.979
Oh. you're talking about when I go?

70
01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:41.315
I'm probably
going to New Jersey or something.

71
01:12:41.398 --> 01:12:43.275
So. we gotta drive
all the way out to New Jersey?

72
01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:44.818
-Do you want to?
-Yes.

73
01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:46.362
-Why?
-Because.

74
01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:48.697
A'ight. You gonna come see me then?

75
01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:50.115
We gotta drive them little buses.

76
01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.867
-You know what this mean?
-No.

77
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:53.535
This mean I gotta make a promise to you.

78
01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:55.621
Want me to tell you my promise?

79
01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:56.747
Mm-hmm.

80
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:58.999
I promise to never leave you again.

81
01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:01.043
-Okay.
-You don't want that. do you?

82
01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:03.629
You want me to stay in your life forever?

83
01:13:04.755 --> 01:13:06.256
So. you gonna keep that forever?

84
01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:08.342
You sure?

85
01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:12.096
-Who love you more than Daddy?
-Nobody.

86
01:14:36.513 --> 01:14:37.347
I'm sorry.

87
01:14:41.852 --> 01:14:42.853

90
01:14:53.864 --> 01:14:55.365
My change starts here…

91
01:14:56.366 --> 01:14:57.367
before I get out.

92
01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:01.830
I give you this.
for protecting our promise.

93
01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:03.540
I love you.

94
01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:41.537
-I'mma miss you.

I'm gonna be okay.

97
01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:55.968
Take three deep breaths.

98
01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:58.303
and then we gonna say. "See you later."

99
01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:00.597

147
01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:39.360
Hey. Bre!

148
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:41.988
Can you hear me?

149
01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:44.574
The phone is in and out.

150
01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:48.161
Baby?

151
01:26:51.164 --> 01:26:52.582
You see. you know
how to answer the phone now

152
01:26:52.665 --> 01:26:53.958
when Daddy call?

153
01:26:55.752 --> 01:26:57.170
So. make sure when Daddy call.

154
01:26:57.253 --> 01:26:58.880
when you see Daddy calling.

155
01:26:58.963 --> 01:27:01.424
put that--
put that game down and answer the phone.

156
01:27:09.098 --> 01:27:10.642
I wish I can too. baby.

157
01:29:50.593 --> 01:29:52.637
I always think about that dance

158
01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:55.056
when I can touch him. it's like…

159
01:29:55.681 --> 01:29:58.393
it's like nothing else on Earth.

160
01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:29.718
When I came out.
she really didn't recognize me.

161
01:37:40.896 --> 01:37:43.065
There was plexiglass between us.

162
01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.570
Couldn't hear-- I couldn't hear.

163
01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:50.656
She wouldn't open up to me.

164
01:37:54.285 --> 01:37:56.829
I thought it was like.
oh. she was upset with me.

165
01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:04.628
It got to me a lot. you know?

166
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:07.089
I thought it would be better.

167
01:38:30.613 --> 01:38:33.532
I would like to touch her.
so it could reset.

168
01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:44.919
When she asked to leave.
I was just like. "Oh…"

169
01:38:47.630 --> 01:38:49.381
It was like very hard on me.

170
01:38:59.892 --> 01:39:01.101
Yeah. I can hear you now.

171
01:39:01.185 --> 01:39:03.145
I can hear you way better now.

172
01:39:05.481 --> 01:39:07.942
Did you ever get--
you finally got something to eat?

173
01:39:10.653 --> 01:39:11.487
Okay.

174
01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:15.449
Huh?

175
01:39:18.285 --> 01:39:19.119
Yeah.

176
01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:22.164
I tried calling you. I tried calling you.

177
01:39:22.247 --> 01:39:24.208
You didn't answer.
so I figured you probably was eating.

178
01:39:27.878 --> 01:39:28.712
Okay.

179
01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.716
You had a good visit on Daddy?

180
01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.677
