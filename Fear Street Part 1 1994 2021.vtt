that this witch shit is real.

874
00:51:41.166 --> 00:51:44.291
Yeah. it's something babysitters make up
to scare kids.

875
00:51:44.375 --> 00:51:45.750
No. no. Just listen to me.

876
00:51:45.833 --> 00:51:50.083
1666. Sarah Fier was hanged
for witchcraft. fact.

877
00:51:50.583 --> 00:51:53.333
But ever since she was executed.
she's been possessing people.

878
00:51:53.416 --> 00:51:55.958
turning them into killers.
to take revenge on the town.

879
00:51:56.041 --> 00:51:59.000
-[Simon] It's like the nursery rhyme.
-[Josh] Yeah. Yeah.

880
00:51:59.083 --> 00:52:03.083
[Simon] "Before the witch's final breath.
she found a way to cheat her death."

881
00:52:04.125 --> 00:52:06.833
"By cutting off her cursed hand.

882
00:52:06.916 --> 00:52:09.916
she kept her grip upon our land."

883
00:52:10.708 --> 00:52:14.666
"She reaches from beyond the grave

884
00:52:15.458 --> 00:52:18.875
to make good men her wicked slaves."

885
00:52:18.958 --> 00:52:20.500
Yes. exactly.

886
00:52:20.583 --> 00:52:24.166
Don't you see what's happening to us?
This is all proof.

887
00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:26.750
Shadyside isn't just
some hotbed for psychos.

888
00:52:26.833 --> 00:52:29.666
All these massacres are connected
to Sarah Fier.

889
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:31.250
The witch's curse is real!

890
00:52:31.333 --> 00:52:34.541
Fine. Let's assume that the witch
has been possessing people

891
00:52:34.625 --> 00:52:36.875
for some sort of messed-up vendetta.

892
00:52:36.958 --> 00:52:40.416
This isn't the same as the mall massacre.
Something different is happening to us.

893
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:41.750
Something way worse.

894
00:52:41.833 --> 00:52:46.125
OK. we have two of her killers after us
and both of them are dead.

895
00:52:46.708 --> 00:52:48.333
Why is she so mad at us?

896
00:52:48.416 --> 00:52:49.416
[Sam] I saw her.

897
00:52:51.833 --> 00:52:53.166
Last night. I don't…

898
00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:57.166
I don't know. you know.
I thought I hit my head…

899
00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:00.291
It was…

900
00:53:00.791 --> 00:53:01.875
It was her.

901
00:53:03.958 --> 00:53:05.416
I saw the witch.

907

It's her grave.

922

Oh no. no. No!

This is bad! This is really bad!

924
00:54:28.625 --> 00:54:31.208
No wonder the witch is pissed at us.
I'd be pissed too.

925
00:54:31.291 --> 00:54:32.541
Sam disturbed her grave.

926
00:54:34.291 --> 00:54:36.791

her henchmen after us.
