1
00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:54.692
l have sailed the world
Beheld its wonders

2
00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:59.322
From the Dardanelles
To the mountains of Peru

3
00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:03.618
But there's no place like London

4
00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:07.747
No. there's no place like London

5
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.290
Mr. Todd?

6
00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:14.795
You are young
Life has been kind to you

7
00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:22.553
You will learn

8
00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.403
There's a hole in the world
like a great black pit

9
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.364
And the vermin of the world inhabit it

10
00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.491
And its morals aren't worth
what a pig could spit

11
00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:46.118
And it goes by the name of London

12
00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:49.288
At the top of the hole
sit a privileged few

13
00:04:49.373 --> 00:04:51.290
Making mock of the vermin
in the lower zoo

14
00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:53.125
Turning beauty into filth and greed

15
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.547
l too have sailed the world
and seen its wonders

16
00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:03.135
For the cruelty of men
is as wondrous as Peru

17
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.556
But there's no place like London

18
00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:27.868
ls everything all right. Mr. Todd?

19
00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:31.455
l beg your indulgence. Anthony.

20
00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.291
My mind is far from easy.

21
00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:41.424
ln these once familiar streets
l feel shadows everywhere.

22
00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:43.050
Shadows?

23
00:05:44.553 --> 00:05:45.886
Ghosts.

24
00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:56.689
There was a barber and his wife

25
00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.734
And she was beautiful

26
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:04.238
A foolish barber and his wife

27
00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:07.366
She was his reason and his life

28
00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:10.661
And she was beautiful

29
00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:15.249
And she was virtuous

30
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.879
And he was

31
00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:25.634


naive

32
00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.729
There was another man who saw

33
00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.899
that she was beautiful

34
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.070
A pious vulture of the law

35
00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:47.531
Who. with a gesture of his claw

36
00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:51.160
Removed the barber from his plate

37
00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:55.748
Then there was nothing but to wait

38
00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:58.250
And she would fall

39
00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:04.799
So soft. so young
so lost and. oh. so beautiful

40
00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:11.764
And the lady. sir. did she succumb?

41
00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:16.227
Oh. that was many years ago

42
00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:23.275
I doubt if anyone would know

43
00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.120
l'd like to thank you. Anthony.

44
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:38.290
lf you hadn't spotted me.
l'd be lost on the ocean still.

45
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.335
Will l see you again?

46
00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.964
You might find me if you like.

47
00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.468
Around Fleet Street. l wouldn't wonder.

48
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.347
Until then. my friend.

49
00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:05.651
There's a hole in the world
like a great black pit

50
00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.820
And it's filled with people
who are filled with shit

51
00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.614
And the vermin of the world inhabit it

52
00:09:04.628 --> 00:09:05.669
A customer!

53
00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.546
Wait! What's your rush?
What's your hurry?

54
00:09:07.631 --> 00:09:09.882
You gave me such a fright
I thought you was a ghost!

55
00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:12.593
Half a minute. can't you sit?
Sit you down. Sit!

56
00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:15.221
All l meant is that l haven't seen
a customer for weeks!

57
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.765
Did you come here for a pie. sir?

58
00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:20.100
Do forgive me
if me head's a little vague

59
00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.227
What was that?

60
00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:25.022
But you'd think we had the plague!
From the way that people keep avoiding

61
00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:26.106
No. you don't.

62
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.317
Heaven knows I try. sir!

63
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:31.070
But there's no one
comes in even to inhale

64
00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:33.906
Right you are. sir
would you like a drop of ale?

65
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.201
Mind you. I can hardly blame them

66
00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:41.622
These are probably
the worst pies in London

67
00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:44.250
I know why nobody cares to take them

68
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:47.586
l should know. l make them
But good? No!

69
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:50.714
The worst pies in London

70
00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:54.677
Even that's polite
The worst pies in London

71
00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:57.304
If you doubt it. take a bite

72
00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:03.435
Is thatjust disgusting?
You have to concede it

73
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.604
It's nothing but crusting

74
00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:11.277
Here. drink this. you'll need it
The worst pies in London

75
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.946
And no wonder
with the price of meat what it is

76
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.949
When you get it
Never thought I'd live to see the day

77
00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.160
Men'd think it was a treat
Finding poor animals

78
00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:21.412
What are dying in the street

79
00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:23.872
Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop

80
00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.500
Does her business
but I noticed something weird

81
00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:29.128
Lately all her neighbors' cats
have disappeared

82
00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:32.298
Have to hand it to her
What I calls enterprise

83
00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.049
Popping pussies into pies

84
00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.302
Wouldn't do in my shop

85
00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:38.971
Just the thought of it's enough
to make you sick

86
00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.141
And I'm telling you
them pussycats is quick

87
00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:45.602
No denying times is hard. sir!

88
00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:49.648
Even harder than
the worst pies in London

89
00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:53.402
Only lard and nothing more
Is thatjust revolting

90
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.487
All greasy and gritty

91
00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.781
It looks like it's molting

92
00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.867
And tastes like

93
00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:01.368
Well. pity

94
00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:04.705
A woman alone!

95
00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:08.500
With limited wind

96
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:13.589
And the worst pies in London

97
00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:16.133
Sir

98
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:24.641
Times is hard

99
00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:31.315
Trust me. dearie. it's gonna take a lot
more than ale to wash that taste out.

100
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.611
Come with me.
We'll get you a nice tumbler of gin. eh?

101
00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.208
lsn't this homey. now?

102
00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:53.545
The cheery wallpaper
was a real bargain. too.

103
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.256
lt was only partly singed when
the chapel burned down.

104
00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.760
There you go.
You sit down. warm your bones.

105
00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:03.305
You've a room over the shop here?

106
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.724
Times is so hard.
why don't you rent it out?

107
00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:08.811
What. up there? No. l won't go near it.

108
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.065
People think it's haunted.

109
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.859
-Haunted?
-Yeah.

110
00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:19.488
And who's to say they're wrong?

111
00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:23.951
You see. years ago.
something happened up there.

112
00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.120
Something not very nice.

113
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.959
There was a barber and his wife

114
00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:36.672
And he was beautiful

115
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:40.134
A proper artist with a knife

116
00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:43.512
But they transported him for life

117
00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:47.057
And he was beautiful

118
00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:52.688
Barker. his name was. Benjamin Barker.

119
00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.732
What was his crime?

120
00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:57.693
Foolishness.

121
00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:01.488
He had this wife. you see

122
00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.782
Pretty little thing. silly little nit

123
00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:07.995
Had her chance
for the moon on a string

124
00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:14.168
Poor thing

125
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.963
There was this judge. you see

126
00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:22.634
Wanted her like mad
Every day he sent her a flower

127
00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:25.429
But did she come down from her tower?

128
00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:28.974
Sat up there and sobbed by the hour

129
00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.560
Poor fool

130
00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:35.022
But there was worse yet to come
poor thing

131
00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:46.408
Well. Beadle calls on her all polite
Poor thing

132
00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.494
Poor thing

133
00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:51.663
The Judge. he tells her is all contrite

134
00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:55.000
He blames himself
for her dreadful plight

135
00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:58.170
She must come straight
to his house tonight

136
00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:01.006
Poor thing. poor thing

137
00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:09.181
Of course. when she goes there
Poor thing. poor thing

138
00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:12.142
They're having this ball all in masks

139
00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:15.395
There's no one she knows there
Poor dear. poor thing

140
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.482
She wanders tormented and drinks
Poor thing

141
00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:21.527
The Judge has repented. she thinks
Poor thing

142
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:24.696
"Oh. where is Judge Turpin?"
she asks

143
00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:29.368
He was there all right
Only not so contrite

144
00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:35.249
She wasn't no match for such craft
you see

145
00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.043
And everyone thought it so droll

146
00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:41.046
They figured she had to be daft
you see

147
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.132
So all of them stood there and laughed
you see

148
00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.551
Poor soul

149
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.554
Poor thing...

150
00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:57.813
No!

151
00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.818
Would no one have mercy on her?

152
00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:05.654
So. it is you.

153
00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.198
Benjamin Barker?

154
00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.577
Where is Lucy?

155
00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.746
Where is my wife?

156
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.291
She poisoned herself.

157
00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:21.086
Arsenic. from the apothecary
around the corner.

158
00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:25.674
Tried to stop her.
but she wouldn't listen to me.

159
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.346
And he's got your daughter.

160
00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:34.850
He?

161
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.603
Judge Turpin?

162
00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:42.065
Adopted her. Like his own.

163
00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:45.527
Fifteen years.

164
00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:49.865
l've sweated in a living hell
on a false charge.

165
00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:56.455
Fifteen years dreaming l might
come home to a wife and child.

166
00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:01.460
Well. l can't say the years have been
particularly kind to you. Mr. Barker.

167
00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:04.087
No. Not Barker.

168
00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:07.049
That man is dead.

169
00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:11.136
lt's Todd now. Sweeney Todd.

170
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:15.140
And he will have his revenge.

171
00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.758
Come in.

172
00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:52.469
Nothing to be afraid of. love.

173
00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:42.394
When they came for the girl. l hid them.

174
00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:45.147
Could've sold them. but l didn't.

175
00:17:56.993 --> 00:18:00.036
Those handles is chased silver.
ain't they?

176
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:04.082
Silver. Yes.

177
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.179
These are my friends

178
00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:22.893
See how they glisten

179
00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:27.147
See this one shine

180
00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:32.486
How he smiles in the light

181
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.906
My friend

182
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:40.202
My faithful friend

183
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:46.625
Speak to me. friend

184
00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:51.213
Whisper. I'll listen

185
00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:55.634
l know. l know

186
00:18:55.718 --> 00:19:02.390
You've been locked
out of sight all these years

187
00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:07.229
Like me. my friend

188
00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:11.441
Well. l've come home

189
00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:15.737
To find you waiting

190
00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.491
Home

191
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:23.578
And we're together

192
00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:28.124
And we'll do wonders

193
00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:32.128
Won't we?

194
00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:36.049
You there. my friend

195
00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:40.053
-I'm your friend. too. Mr. Todd
-Come. let me hold you

196
00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:43.598
-If you only knew. Mr. Todd
-Now. with a sigh

197
00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:44.933
Oh. Mr. Todd

198
00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:48.687
-you're warm in my hand
-You grow warm in my hand

199
00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:50.772
My friend

200
00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:54.609
-You've come home
-My clever friend

201
00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:58.488
Always had a fondness for you. I did

202
00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:01.283
Rest now. my friends

203
00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:05.662
-Never you fear. Mr. Todd
-Soon l'll unfold you

204
00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:08.498
-You can move in here. Mr. Todd
-Soon you'll know

205
00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:11.751
-Splendors you never
-Splendors you never

206
00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:15.046
-have dreamed all your days
-have dreamed all your days

207
00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:16.715
Will be yours

208
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:19.384
My lucky friends

209
00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:23.555
-I'm your friend and now you're mine
-Till now your shine...

210
00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:27.934
-Don't they shine beautiful?
-...was merely silver

211
00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:30.562
Silver's good enough for me

212
00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:36.526
-Friends. you shall drip rubies
-Mr. T

213
00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:41.531
You'll soon drip precious

214
00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:46.161
rubies

215
00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:55.378
Leave me.

216
00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:13.563
At last. my arm is complete again.

217
00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:19.254
Green finch and linnet bird
Nightingale. blackbird

218
00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:22.590
How is it you sing?

219
00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:27.679
How can you jubilate
Sitting in cages

220
00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:30.849
Never taking wing?

221
00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:36.521
Outside the sky waits
Beckoning. beckoning

222
00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:39.399
Just beyond the bars

223
00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:44.154
How can you remain
Staring at the rain

224
00:22:44.238 --> 00:22:48.158
Maddened by the stars?

225
00:22:49.577 --> 00:22:53.788
How is it you sing anything?

226
00:22:54.457 --> 00:22:58.501
How is it you sing?

227
00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:16.561
My cage has many rooms
Damask and dark

228
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:22.108
Nothing there sings
Not even my lark

229
00:23:22.193 --> 00:23:26.613
Larks never will. you know
When they're captive

230
00:23:26.697 --> 00:23:31.993
Teach me to be more adaptive

231
00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:41.586
Green finch and linnet bird
Nightingale. blackbird

232
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:45.799
Teach me how to sing

233
00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:50.845
If I cannot fly

234
00:23:52.098 --> 00:23:58.770
Let me sing

235
00:24:10.157 --> 00:24:11.699
Alms!

236
00:24:11.784 --> 00:24:16.579
Alms for a miserable woman

237
00:24:18.374 --> 00:24:24.420
On a miserable chilly morning

238
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:28.800
-Thank you. sir!
-Ma'am?

239
00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:32.929
Could you tell me whose house this is?

240
00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:36.307
That's the great
Judge Turpin's house. that is.

241
00:24:36.392 --> 00:24:38.810
And the young lady who resides there?

242
00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:42.897
Oh. that's Johanna.
his pretty little ward.

243
00:24:43.065 --> 00:24:46.442
Keeps her snug. he does. All locked up.

244
00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:51.865
So don't you go trespassing there.
or it's a good whipping for you.

245
00:24:51.949 --> 00:24:55.827
or any other young man
with mischief on his mind.

246
00:24:56.704 --> 00:24:58.163
Alms!

247
00:24:58.247 --> 00:25:03.376
Alms for a desperate woman

248
00:25:08.174 --> 00:25:12.302
I feel you

249
00:25:12.386 --> 00:25:16.347
Johanna

250
00:25:16.432 --> 00:25:20.768
I feel you

251
00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:24.772
l was half convinced l'd waken

252
00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:28.860
Satisfied enough to dream you

253
00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:35.074
Happily I was mistaken. Johanna

254
00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:40.288
I'll steal you

255
00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:44.209
Johanna!

256
00:25:44.293 --> 00:25:48.880
I'll steal you

257
00:26:03.437 --> 00:26:05.605
Come in. lad. Come in.

258
00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:14.989
You were looking for Hyde Park.
you say?

259
00:26:15.115 --> 00:26:16.407
Yes.

260
00:26:16.951 --> 00:26:20.453
lt's very large on the map.
but l keep getting lost.

261
00:26:20.537 --> 00:26:22.664
Sit down. lad. sit down.

262
00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:28.044
lt's embarrassing for a sailor
to lose his bearings. but there you are.

263
00:26:32.675 --> 00:26:34.175
A sailor?

264
00:26:35.636 --> 00:26:38.388
Yes. sir. The Bountiful. out of Plymouth.

265
00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:42.141
A sailor must know
the ways of the world. yes?

266
00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:46.562
Must be practiced
in the ways of the world.

267
00:26:46.647 --> 00:26:48.690
Would you say you were practiced. boy?

268
00:26:48.857 --> 00:26:52.193
-Sir?
-Oh. yes.

269
00:26:53.362 --> 00:26:56.698
Such practices.

270
00:26:58.367 --> 00:27:02.620
The geishas of Japan.
The concubines of Siam.

271
00:27:02.705 --> 00:27:07.208
The catamites of Greece.
The harlots of lndia.

272
00:27:08.794 --> 00:27:12.505
l have them all here. Drawings of them.

273
00:27:12.589 --> 00:27:18.177
Everything you've ever dreamed
of doing with a woman.

274
00:27:19.555 --> 00:27:21.472
Would you like to see?

275
00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:25.059
l think there's been some mistake.

276
00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:27.395
l think not.

277
00:27:29.606 --> 00:27:34.527
You gandered at my ward. Johanna.
You gandered at her.

278
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:38.990
-Yes. sir. you gandered.
-l meant no harm.

279
00:27:39.074 --> 00:27:41.242
Your meaning is immaterial.

280
00:27:42.703 --> 00:27:44.162
Mark me.

281
00:27:44.246 --> 00:27:51.169
lf l see your face again on this street.
you'll rue the day you were born.

282
00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:57.800
Hyde Park is that way. young sir!

283
00:27:57.885 --> 00:28:01.054
A left and a right and straight on.
you see?

284
00:28:01.138 --> 00:28:03.139
Move on. now!

285
00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:15.193
You heard what Judge Turpin said.
little man.

286
00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:20.907
Next time. it'll be your pretty little brains
all over the pavement.

287
00:28:45.182 --> 00:28:49.060
I'll steal you

288
00:28:49.144 --> 00:28:53.106
Johanna

289
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:57.485
I'll steal you

290
00:28:57.569 --> 00:29:01.406
Do they think that walls can hide you?

291
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:05.410
Even now. I'm at your window

292
00:29:05.494 --> 00:29:10.039
I am in the dark beside you

293
00:29:10.124 --> 00:29:15.169
Buried sweetly in your yellow hair

294
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:25.596
I feel you

295
00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:29.517
Johanna

296
00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:33.479
And one day

297
00:29:33.564 --> 00:29:38.443
I'll steal you

298
00:29:38.527 --> 00:29:42.321
Till I'm with you then
I'm with you there!

299
00:29:42.406 --> 00:29:47.326
Sweetly buried in your yellow hair!

300
00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:13.394
He's here every Thursday.
ltalian. All the rage he is.

301
00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:16.564
Best barber in London. they say.

302
00:30:48.013 --> 00:30:49.263
Hang on.

303
00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:25.383
Ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention. please?

304
00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:28.719
Do you wake every morning
in shame and despair

305
00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:31.722
To discover your pillow
is covered with hair

306
00:31:31.807 --> 00:31:33.766
What ought not to be there?

307
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:37.728
Well. ladies and gentlemen
From now on you can waken at ease

308
00:31:37.813 --> 00:31:39.730
You need never again
have a worry or care

309
00:31:39.815 --> 00:31:42.567
I will show you a miracle
marvelous rare

310
00:31:43.527 --> 00:31:45.361
Gentlemen. you are about
to see something

311
00:31:45.445 --> 00:31:48.364
What rose from the dead!

312
00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:51.284
On the top of my head!

313
00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:57.248
'Twas Pirelli's Miracle Elixir

314
00:31:57.332 --> 00:32:00.751
That's what did the trick. sir
True. sir. true

315
00:32:00.836 --> 00:32:04.422
Was it quick. sir? Did it in a tick. sir?

316
00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:08.092
Just like an elixir ought to do

317
00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:12.597
How about a bottle. mister?
Only costs a penny. guaranteed

318
00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:18.811
Does Pirelli's stimulate the growth. sir?

319
00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:22.273
You can have my oath. sir
'Tis unique

320
00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:25.818
Rub a minute
Stimulating. isn't it?

321
00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:29.655
Soon you'll have to thin it
Once a week!

322
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.449
Pardon me. ma'am
what's that awful stench?

323
00:32:31.533 --> 00:32:33.159
Are we standing in an open trench?

324
00:32:33.243 --> 00:32:34.243
Must be standing near an open trench!

325
00:32:34.328 --> 00:32:35.328
Pardon me. sir
what's that awful stench?

326
00:32:35.412 --> 00:32:38.331
Buy Pirelli's Miracle Elixir

327
00:32:38.415 --> 00:32:42.001
Anything what's slick. sir
Soon sprouts curls

328
00:32:42.085 --> 00:32:45.504
Try Pirelli's
When they see how thick. sir

329
00:32:45.589 --> 00:32:49.216
You can have your pick. sir
Of the girls

330
00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:50.468
Want to buy a bottle. missus?

331
00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:52.136
-What is this?
-What is this?

332
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.764
-Smells like piss
-Smells like...

333
00:32:54.848 --> 00:32:56.641
-Looks like piss!
-Wouldn't touch it if I was you. dear!

334
00:32:56.725 --> 00:33:00.186
-This is piss. piss with ink
-Let Pirelli's activate your roots. sir!

335
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.812
Keep it off your boots. sir
Eats right through

336
00:33:01.897 --> 00:33:04.774
Yes. get Pirelli's. use a bottle of it
Ladies seem to love it

337
00:33:04.858 --> 00:33:06.776
Flies do. too

338
00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:11.489
l am Adolfo Pirelli

339
00:33:11.573 --> 00:33:13.658
The king of the barbers
The barber of kings

340
00:33:13.742 --> 00:33:17.036
E buon giorno. good day!
I blow you a kiss!

341
00:33:17.579 --> 00:33:19.455
And l

342
00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:21.749
the so famous Pirelli
l wish-a to know-a

343
00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:24.710
Who has-a the nerve-a to say

344
00:33:24.795 --> 00:33:27.004
My elixir is piss

345
00:33:27.923 --> 00:33:30.174
Who says this?

346
00:33:32.678 --> 00:33:33.928
l do.

347
00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:38.808
l am Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street.

348
00:33:39.976 --> 00:33:42.353
l have opened a bottle of Pirelli's Elixir.

349
00:33:42.437 --> 00:33:46.440
And l say to you that it is nothing
but an arrant fraud.

350
00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:50.194
concocted from piss and ink.

351
00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:54.990
Furthermore. Signor.
l have serviced no kings.

352
00:33:56.159 --> 00:34:00.955
yet l wager that l can shave a cheek
with 1 0 times more dexterity.

353
00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:03.457
than any street mountebank.

354
00:34:08.296 --> 00:34:10.297
Do you see these razors?

355
00:34:11.174 --> 00:34:13.801
l lay them against £5.

356
00:34:14.594 --> 00:34:16.637
You are no match. sir.

357
00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:22.017
Either accept my challenge.
or reveal yourself as a sham.

358
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.147
You hear this foolish man?

359
00:34:26.815 --> 00:34:32.153
Now. please. you will see
how he will-a regret-a his-a folly.

360
00:34:33.155 --> 00:34:34.613
Toby!

361
00:34:34.698 --> 00:34:36.657
Who's for a free shave?

362
00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:01.682
Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?

363
00:35:01.767 --> 00:35:06.479
Glad. as always.
to oblige my friends and neighbors.

364
00:35:17.908 --> 00:35:19.158
Ready?

365
00:35:19.785 --> 00:35:21.035
Ready!

366
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.912
Ready.

367
00:35:23.538 --> 00:35:28.042
The fastest.
smoothest shave is the winner!

368
00:35:52.734 --> 00:35:55.444
Now. signorini. signori
We mix-a the lather

369
00:35:55.529 --> 00:35:58.447
But first-a
You gather around. signorini. signori

370
00:35:58.532 --> 00:36:01.575
You looking a man who have
had-a the glory to shave-a the Pope!

371
00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.869
Mr. Sweeney. whoever
I beg-a you pardon

372
00:36:03.954 --> 00:36:06.372
You'll probably say
it was only a cardinal

373
00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:07.832
Nope!

374
00:36:07.916 --> 00:36:09.792
It was-a the Pope!

375
00:36:12.128 --> 00:36:17.007
To shave-a the face
To cut-a the hair

376
00:36:17.092 --> 00:36:22.137
Require the grace
Require the flair

377
00:36:22.222 --> 00:36:24.723
For if-a you slip
You nick the skin

378
00:36:24.808 --> 00:36:27.434
You clip-a the chin
You rip-a the lip a bit

379
00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:29.854
Beyond-a repair

380
00:36:30.438 --> 00:36:32.606
To shave-a the face

381
00:36:33.358 --> 00:36:37.152
Or even a part
Without it-a smart

382
00:36:37.863 --> 00:36:40.739
Require the heart

383
00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:43.367
Notjust-a the flash

384
00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:48.998
It take-a panache
It take-a the passion for the art

385
00:36:50.876 --> 00:36:55.379
To shave-a the face
To trim-a the beard

386
00:36:55.964 --> 00:37:00.217
To make-a the bristle
Clean like a whistle

387
00:37:00.302 --> 00:37:06.307
This is from early infancy
The talent give to me

388
00:37:06.516 --> 00:37:09.602
By God

389
00:37:12.772 --> 00:37:16.817
lt take-a the skill
lt take-a the brains

390
00:37:17.277 --> 00:37:22.990
lt take-a da will
To take-a the pains

391
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:28.913
It take-a the pace
It take-a the grace

392
00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:40.841
The winner is Todd!

393
00:37:52.354 --> 00:37:56.273
Sir. l bow to a skill
far greater than my own.

394
00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:59.193
The £5.

395
00:38:05.659 --> 00:38:08.160
May the good Lord smile on you.

396
00:38:09.621 --> 00:38:11.538
Until we meet again.

397
00:38:12.248 --> 00:38:14.208
Come. boy. Come!

398
00:38:23.677 --> 00:38:25.302
Suppose it's just me gentle heart.

399
00:38:25.387 --> 00:38:28.514
but l do hate to see a boy
treated like that.

400
00:38:28.598 --> 00:38:31.100
Congratulations. Mr. Todd.

401
00:38:31.184 --> 00:38:34.019
May l ask you. sir.
do you have your own establishment?

402
00:38:34.104 --> 00:38:35.688
He certainly does.

403
00:38:35.772 --> 00:38:38.148
Sweeney Todd's Tonsorial Parlor.

404
00:38:38.233 --> 00:38:41.318
above my Meat Pie Emporium
in Fleet Street.

405
00:38:44.948 --> 00:38:47.032
l thank you. sir.

406
00:38:47.117 --> 00:38:49.910
You are a paragon of integrity.

407
00:38:49.995 --> 00:38:54.206
Well. l try to do my best for
my friends and neighbors.

408
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.419
Your establishment
is in Fleet Street. you say?

409
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.130
-Yes. sir.
-Then. Mr. Todd.

410
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:05.718
you shall surely see me there
before the week is out.

411
00:39:05.969 --> 00:39:08.512
You will be welcome. Beadle Bamford.

412
00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:12.850
And l can guarantee to give you.
without a penny's charge.

413
00:39:12.934 --> 00:39:15.602
the closest shave you will ever know.

414
00:39:26.156 --> 00:39:27.823
Come on. love.

415
00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:49.780
lt's not much of a chair. but it'll do.

416
00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:53.033
lt was me poor Albert's chair.
Sit in it all day long he did.

417
00:40:53.118 --> 00:40:55.410
after his leg gave out with the gout.

418
00:40:55.495 --> 00:40:57.454
Why doesn't the Beadle come?

419
00:40:57.539 --> 00:41:00.749
"Before the week is out."
that's what he said.

420
00:41:00.834 --> 00:41:04.169
Well. who says the week's out?
lt's only Tuesday.

421
00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:12.928
Easy now
Hush. love. hush

422
00:41:13.012 --> 00:41:17.307
Don't distress yourself
What's your rush?

423
00:41:17.392 --> 00:41:21.645
Keep your thoughts
Nice and lush

424
00:41:21.729 --> 00:41:23.397
Wait

425
00:41:26.234 --> 00:41:30.487
Hush. love. hush
Think it through

426
00:41:30.572 --> 00:41:34.658
Once it bubbles
Then what's to do?

427
00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:38.954
Watch it close
Let it brew

428
00:41:39.038 --> 00:41:40.330
Wait

429
00:41:42.125 --> 00:41:46.837
I've been thinking flowers
Maybe daisies

430
00:41:46.921 --> 00:41:49.047
To brighten up the room

431
00:41:50.383 --> 00:41:55.179
Don't you think some flowers
Pretty daisies

432
00:41:55.263 --> 00:41:57.848
Might relieve the gloom?

433
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:00.934
Wait

434
00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:05.230
Love. wait

435
00:42:05.315 --> 00:42:08.108
And the Judge? When'll we get to him?

436
00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:12.696
Can't you think of nothing else?
Always brooding away on your wrongs

437
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.741
and what happened
heaven knows how many years ago.

438
00:42:15.825 --> 00:42:17.367
Come on.

439
00:42:17.452 --> 00:42:21.205
Slow. love. slow
Time's so fast

440
00:42:21.789 --> 00:42:26.043
Now goes quickly
See. now it's past

441
00:42:26.127 --> 00:42:30.130
Soon will come
Soon will last

442
00:42:30.215 --> 00:42:31.632
Wait

443
00:42:34.636 --> 00:42:38.764
Don't you know
Silly man

444
00:42:38.848 --> 00:42:42.434
Half the fun is to plan the plan?

445
00:42:43.102 --> 00:42:47.189
All good things
come to those who can

446
00:42:47.273 --> 00:42:48.523
Wait

447
00:42:51.694 --> 00:42:56.406
Gillyflowers. maybe
'Stead of daisies

448
00:42:56.574 --> 00:43:01.078
I don't know. though
What do you think?

449
00:43:10.964 --> 00:43:12.631
Oh. l'm sorry. excuse me.

450
00:43:12.715 --> 00:43:15.425
-Mrs. Lovett. sir.
-A pleasure. ma'am.

451
00:43:16.261 --> 00:43:18.345
Mr. Todd.
there's a girl who needs my help.

452
00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:20.472
Such a sad girl and lonely.
but beautiful. too and...

453
00:43:20.556 --> 00:43:24.184
-Slow down. son.
-Yes. l'm sorry.

454
00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:27.521
This girl has a guardian
who keeps her locked away.

455
00:43:27.605 --> 00:43:29.690
but then. this morning.
she dropped this.

456
00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:32.067
Surely a sign
that Johanna wants me to help her.

457
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:33.735
That's her name. Johanna.

458
00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.072
And Turpin is her guardian.
He's a judge of some sort.

459
00:43:37.156 --> 00:43:39.116
Once he goes to court.
l'm going to slip into the house.

460
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.576
release her and beg her
to come away with me tonight.

461
00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:44.079
-Oh. this is very romantic.
-Yes.

462
00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:47.165
But l don't know anyone in London.
you see.

463
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.295
And l need somewhere safe to bring her
till l've hired a coach to take us away.

464
00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:53.422
lf l could keep her here
just for an hour or two.

465
00:43:53.506 --> 00:43:55.757
l'd be forever in your debt.

466
00:43:59.512 --> 00:44:02.973
-Bring her here. love.
-Thank you. ma'am.

467
00:44:03.891 --> 00:44:05.309
Mr. Todd?

468
00:44:07.186 --> 00:44:09.396
Oh. thank you.
Thank you. thank you. my friend.

469
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.231
Thank you. ma'am.

470
00:44:14.277 --> 00:44:17.821
Seems like the Fates
are favoring you at last. Mr. T.

471
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.743
What is it? You'll have her back
before the day is out.

472
00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:24.828
What about him?

473
00:44:25.747 --> 00:44:26.955
Him?

474
00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.666
Oh. well. Let him bring her here.

475
00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:32.669
And then. since you're so hot for a little.

476
00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.423
that's the throat to slit. my dear.

477
00:44:38.176 --> 00:44:39.968
Poor little Johanna.

478
00:44:40.053 --> 00:44:43.513
All those years without a scrap
of motherly affection.

479
00:44:43.973 --> 00:44:47.100
Well. l'll soon see to that.

480
00:44:55.276 --> 00:44:58.612
Hello. What's he doing here?

481
00:45:00.615 --> 00:45:02.908
Keep the boy downstairs.

482
00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.630
Signora. is Mr. Todd at home?

483
00:45:16.714 --> 00:45:18.882
Plying his trade upstairs.

484
00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:21.593
Would you look at it now?

485
00:45:21.677 --> 00:45:24.221
You wouldn't mind if l gave it a nice
juicy meat pie. would you?

486
00:45:24.305 --> 00:45:28.141
-Sì. sì. sì. Whatever you want.
-Come on. lad.

487
00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:30.977
Your teeth are strong. l hope.

488
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.108
Close the door.
Get you a nice lovely pie.

489
00:45:38.903 --> 00:45:41.279
Sit down. Make yourself comfy.

490
00:45:48.704 --> 00:45:50.163
Come in.

491
00:45:59.006 --> 00:46:01.758
-Mr. Todd.
-Signor Pirelli.

492
00:46:03.344 --> 00:46:04.845
Call me Davey.

493
00:46:05.847 --> 00:46:09.266
Davey Collin's the name
when it's not professional.

494
00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:12.936
l'd like me five quid back.
if you don't mind.

495
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.104
Why?

496
00:46:14.188 --> 00:46:18.275
Because you entered into our little
wager under false pretenses. my friend.

497
00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:22.988
So that you might remember
to be a bit more forthright in the future.

498
00:46:23.072 --> 00:46:25.031
l'll be taking half your profits
from herewith.

499
00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:27.075
Share and share alike.

500
00:46:28.578 --> 00:46:31.037
Mr. Benjamin Barker.

501
00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:36.626
Here we are. Tuck in.

502
00:46:40.214 --> 00:46:43.133
l like to see a man
with a healthy appetite.

503
00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:45.552
Reminds me of my dear Albert.

504
00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:49.764
Liked to gorge himself
to bloatation. he did.

505
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:52.142
He didn't have
your nice head of hair. though.

506
00:46:52.226 --> 00:46:55.520
To tell the truth. it gets awful hot.

507
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.860
Yes. this'll do nicely.

508
00:47:05.448 --> 00:47:08.825
You don't remember me. do you?
Why should you?

509
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:11.244
l was just a little nip
that you hired for a couple of weeks.

510
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:13.330
sweeping up hair.

511
00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:16.333
But l remember these.

512
00:47:17.126 --> 00:47:20.212
And how could
l ever forget you. Mr. Barker.

513
00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:26.676
l used to sit right here.

514
00:47:27.595 --> 00:47:30.472
Dream of the day
when l could be a proper barber myself.

515
00:47:30.556 --> 00:47:34.309
You might say that you was
inspiration to me.

516
00:47:46.614 --> 00:47:48.532
So. is we got a deal?

517
00:47:49.909 --> 00:47:53.954
Or should l run down the street
to me old pal. Beadle Bamford?

518
00:47:57.542 --> 00:48:01.795
What do you say to that. now.
Mr. Sweeney Todd?

519
00:48:24.402 --> 00:48:27.445
My. my. my. Always work to be done.

520
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.906
Spic and span. that's my motto.

521
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:45.797
So. how'd you end up
with that dreadful ltalian?

522
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:50.260
Got me from the workhouse.
Been there since l was born.

523
00:48:50.344 --> 00:48:52.971
Oh. God!
He's got an appointment with his tailor!

524
00:48:53.055 --> 00:48:54.681
lf he's late. he'll blame me!

525
00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:56.057
Wait!

526
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:05.233
Signor! You got an appointment!

527
00:49:10.448 --> 00:49:14.284
Signor Pirelli's been called away.
Better run after him.

528
00:49:15.202 --> 00:49:19.664
No. sir. l should stay here.
or it'll be a lashing.

529
00:49:19.749 --> 00:49:22.500
He's a great one for the lashings.

530
00:49:28.341 --> 00:49:29.549
So.

531
00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:34.763
-Mrs. Lovett gave you a pie. did she?
-She's a real lady.

532
00:49:35.598 --> 00:49:37.265
That she is.

533
00:49:42.104 --> 00:49:47.150
But if l know a growing boy.
there's still room for more pie. eh?

534
00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:48.568
Yes. sir.

535
00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:52.614
Then why don't you wait
for your master downstairs?

536
00:49:52.698 --> 00:49:57.077
-Be another pie in it for you. l'm sure.
-No. l should stay here.

537
00:49:59.789 --> 00:50:03.750
Tell you what.
why don't you tell Mrs. Lovett

538
00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:07.337
that l said to give you
a nice big tot of gin.

539
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:09.005
Thank you. sir!

540
00:51:16.991 --> 00:51:19.284
This is the second time. sir.

541
00:51:19.368 --> 00:51:22.537
you have been brought
before this bench.

542
00:51:23.748 --> 00:51:27.876
Though it is my earnest wish ever
to temperjustice with mercy.

543
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.129
your persistent dedication
to a life of crime

544
00:51:31.213 --> 00:51:34.924
is an abomination before God and man.

545
00:51:35.009 --> 00:51:38.470
l therefore sentence you
to hang by the neck until you're dead.

546
00:51:38.554 --> 00:51:41.556
And may the Lord
have mercy on your soul.

547
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.392
Court is adjourned.

548
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.862
Thank you. Your Honor.

549
00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:59.407
-Just the sentence we wanted.
-Was he guilty?

550
00:51:59.492 --> 00:52:00.617
Well. if he didn't do it.

551
00:52:00.701 --> 00:52:03.161
he's surely done
something to warrant a hanging.

552
00:52:03.245 --> 00:52:05.997
-What man has not?
-Sorry?

553
00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:10.752
No matter. Come.

554
00:52:11.921 --> 00:52:13.630
Walk home with me.

555
00:52:16.634 --> 00:52:19.344
l have news for you. my friend.

556
00:52:19.428 --> 00:52:22.472
ln order to shield her
from the evils of this world.

557
00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:25.934
l have decided to marry
my dear Johanna.

558
00:52:26.018 --> 00:52:28.436
Sir. happy news indeed.

559
00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:30.104
Strange though.

560
00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:36.402
when l offered myself to her.
she showed a certain reluctance.

561
00:52:37.238 --> 00:52:39.989
Excuse me. my lord
May I request. my lord

562
00:52:40.074 --> 00:52:42.492
Permission. my lord. to speak?

563
00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:44.828
Forgive me if I suggest. my lord

564
00:52:44.912 --> 00:52:47.330
You're looking less
than your best. my lord

565
00:52:47.414 --> 00:52:52.126
There's powder upon your vest. my lord
And stubble upon your cheek

566
00:52:55.256 --> 00:52:59.175
And ladies. my lord. are weak

567
00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:02.262
Stubble. you say?

568
00:53:05.558 --> 00:53:09.060
Perhaps l am
a little overhasty in the mornings.

569
00:53:10.104 --> 00:53:12.605
Fret not though. my lord
I know a place. my lord

570
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.233
A barber. my lord. of skill

571
00:53:15.317 --> 00:53:17.527
Thus armed with a shaven face. my lord

572
00:53:17.611 --> 00:53:19.946
Some eau de cologne to grace. my lord

573
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.532
And musk to enhance the chase
my lord

574
00:53:22.616 --> 00:53:25.493
You'll dazzle the girl until

575
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.787
Until?

576
00:53:28.289 --> 00:53:32.542
She bows to your every will

577
00:53:33.586 --> 00:53:34.919
Barber?

578
00:53:36.171 --> 00:53:37.213
Take me to him.

579
00:53:37.298 --> 00:53:42.051
His name is Todd. my lord. and he is
the very last word in barbering.

580
00:53:48.684 --> 00:53:52.145
You ought to slow down a bit. lad.
lt'll go straight to your head.

581
00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:53.855
They used to give it to us
in the workhouse

582
00:53:53.939 --> 00:53:55.732
so as we could sleep.

583
00:53:55.816 --> 00:53:57.984
Not that you'd want
to sleep in that place. ma'am.

584
00:53:58.068 --> 00:54:00.445
Not with the things
what happen in the dark.

585
00:54:00.529 --> 00:54:01.905
That's nice. dear.

586
00:54:01.989 --> 00:54:03.823
Think l'll just pop in
on Mr. Todd for a tick.

587
00:54:03.908 --> 00:54:06.784
-You all right. there?
-Leave the bottle.

588
00:54:11.749 --> 00:54:15.168
That lad is drinking me
out of house and home.

589
00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:18.504
How long till Pirelli gets back?

590
00:54:19.131 --> 00:54:20.882
He won't be back.

591
00:54:22.718 --> 00:54:24.636
Mr. T. you didn't.

592
00:54:35.814 --> 00:54:39.442
You're barking mad.
Killing a man what done you no harm.

593
00:54:40.235 --> 00:54:44.197
He recognized me from the old days.
Tried to blackmail me.

594
00:54:45.449 --> 00:54:47.116
Half me earnings.

595
00:54:47.785 --> 00:54:50.620
Oh. well. it's a different matter then.

596
00:54:51.497 --> 00:54:55.041
For a moment there.
l thought you'd lost your marbles.

597
00:54:58.045 --> 00:54:59.712
All that blood.

598
00:55:01.215 --> 00:55:02.715
Poor bugger.

599
00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:04.926
Oh. well.

600
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:15.728
Well. waste not. want not.

601
00:55:17.356 --> 00:55:20.650
So. what are we gonna do
about the boy then?

602
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:23.695
Send him up.

603
00:55:24.571 --> 00:55:27.573
Oh. we don't need to worry about him.
He's a simple thing.

604
00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:29.242
Send him up!

605
00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:35.581
Now. Mr. T.
surely one's enough for today.

606
00:55:36.709 --> 00:55:40.211
Besides. l was thinking of hiring the lad
to help me run the shop.

607
00:55:40.295 --> 00:55:43.297
Your poor knees
aren't what they used to be.

608
00:55:44.049 --> 00:55:45.508
All right.

609
00:55:47.511 --> 00:55:49.846
Course. we're gonna
have to stock up on the gin.

610
00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:51.973
Boy drinks like a sailor.

611
00:55:56.103 --> 00:55:57.437
The Judge.

612
00:56:00.899 --> 00:56:02.191
Get out.

613
00:56:04.236 --> 00:56:05.528
Get out!

614
00:56:21.879 --> 00:56:23.421
Mr. Todd?

615
00:56:24.423 --> 00:56:26.090
At your service.

616
00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:30.386
An honor to receive
your patronage. my lord.

617
00:56:31.638 --> 00:56:33.347
You know me. sir?

618
00:56:33.724 --> 00:56:38.978
Who in this wide world
does not know the great Judge Turpin?

619
00:56:45.569 --> 00:56:47.487
These premises
are hardly prepossessing.

620
00:56:47.571 --> 00:56:49.405
and yet the Beadle tells me

621
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:53.451
you're the most accomplished
of all the barbers in the city.

622
00:56:54.078 --> 00:56:56.496
That is gracious of him. sir.

623
00:56:57.498 --> 00:56:59.999
What may l do for you today. sir?

624
00:57:00.709 --> 00:57:03.544
A stylish trimming of the hair?

625
00:57:03.629 --> 00:57:05.630
Soothing skin massage?

626
00:57:05.714 --> 00:57:07.507
Sit. sir. Sit.

627
00:57:08.634 --> 00:57:13.596
You see. sir. a man infatuate with love
Her ardent and eager slave

628
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:18.601
So fetch the pomade and pumice stone
And lend me a more seductive tone

629
00:57:18.685 --> 00:57:23.189
A sprinkling perhaps of French cologne
But first. sir. l think

630
00:57:24.191 --> 00:57:26.859
a shave

631
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:31.697
The closest I ever gave

632
00:57:36.328 --> 00:57:38.621
You're in a merry mood today. Mr. Todd.

633
00:57:38.705 --> 00:57:43.918
'Tis your delight. sir. catching fire
From one man to the next

634
00:57:44.002 --> 00:57:46.587
'Tis true. sir. love can still inspire

635
00:57:46.672 --> 00:57:49.090
The blood to pound
the heart leap higher

636
00:57:49.174 --> 00:57:50.550
-What more
-What more

637
00:57:50.634 --> 00:57:52.802
-can man require than love. sir
-can man require

638
00:57:52.886 --> 00:57:54.137
More than love. sir

639
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:55.513
-What. sir?
-Women

640
00:57:55.597 --> 00:57:58.057
-Yes. women
-Pretty women

641
00:58:29.256 --> 00:58:33.426
Now then. my friend

642
00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:38.431
Now to your purpose

643
00:58:39.391 --> 00:58:43.144
Patience. enjoy it

644
00:58:43.979 --> 00:58:48.441
Revenge can't be taken in haste

645
00:58:48.525 --> 00:58:50.735
Make haste. and if we wed
You'll be commended. sir

646
00:58:50.819 --> 00:58:52.236
My lord

647
00:58:54.781 --> 00:58:57.241
And who. may it be said
Is your intended. sir?

648
00:58:57.326 --> 00:58:59.869
My ward

649
00:59:01.079 --> 00:59:03.414
A pretty little rosebud.

650
00:59:03.498 --> 00:59:05.458
Pretty as her mother?

651
00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.045
What? What was that?

652
00:59:09.129 --> 00:59:13.466
Nothing. sir. Nothing. May we proceed?

653
00:59:15.177 --> 00:59:16.802
Pretty women

654
00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:21.807
Fascinating
Sipping coffee

655
00:59:22.643 --> 00:59:27.772
Dancing
Pretty women!

656
00:59:27.856 --> 00:59:30.233
Are a wonder

657
00:59:30.317 --> 00:59:32.818
Pretty women

658
00:59:35.614 --> 00:59:40.493
Sitting in the window or

659
00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:45.498
Standing on the stair

660
00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:52.213
Something in them
Cheers the air

661
00:59:55.842 --> 00:59:57.677
Pretty women

662
00:59:58.679 --> 01:00:00.513
Silhouetted

663
01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:03.557
Stay within you

664
01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:06.185
Glancing!

665
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.562
Stay forever

666
01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:11.274
Breathing lightly

667
01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.484
Pretty women

668
01:00:13.568 --> 01:00:15.987
-Pretty women
-Pretty women

669
01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:20.866
-Blowing out their candles or
-Blowing out their candles or

670
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:24.245
-Combing out their hair
-Combing out their hair

671
01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:25.871
Then they leave

672
01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:27.873
-Even when they leave...
-Even when they

673
01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.500
leave you and vanish...

674
01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:32.503
-...they still...
-...they somehow can still remain...

675
01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:38.092
-...are there. they're there
-...there with you

676
01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:39.218
-Pretty women
-Pretty women

677
01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:40.845
-At their mirrors
-In their gardens

678
01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:42.471
-Letter-Writing
-Flower-picking

679
01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:43.639
weather-Watching

680
01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:48.519
-How they make a man sing
-How they make a man sing

681
01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:51.147
-Proof of heaven

682
01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:53.607
-As you're living
-As you're living

683
01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:56.110
-Pretty women. sir!
-Pretty women. sir!

684
01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:58.321
-Pretty women. yes!
-Pretty women. yes!

685
01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:01.824
-Pretty women. sir
-Pretty women. pretty women

686
01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:03.492
Mr. Todd! l've seen Johanna

687
01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:06.370
and she said
she'd leave with me tonight.

688
01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:09.999
You.

689
01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:14.337
There is indeed a higher power
to warn me thus in time.

690
01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:16.339
Johanna elope with you?

691
01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:19.216
l'll make sure that neither you

692
01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:22.636
nor any other man
shall ever set eyes on her again.

693
01:01:23.305 --> 01:01:24.805
As for you. barber.

694
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:27.350
it's all too clear
what company you keep.

695
01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.518
Service them well
and hold their custom.

696
01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:31.437
for you'll have none of mine.

697
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.773
-Mr. Todd. You have to help me.
-Out.

698
01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:35.274
-Mr. Todd. please.
-Out.

699
01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:37.318
-Mr. Todd!
-Out!

700
01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:44.283
All this shouting and running about.

701
01:01:44.368 --> 01:01:46.535
-What's happened?
-l had him.

702
01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.870
The sailor busted in. l know.

703
01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:49.372
And then l saw them both
running down the stairs.

704
01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:50.956
l had him!

705
01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:53.125
His throat was bare beneath my hand

706
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:56.128
-There. there. dear. Calm down.
-No. l had him!

707
01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:58.672
His throat was there
And he'll never come again!

708
01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:01.717
Easy now. Hush. love. hush

709
01:02:01.802 --> 01:02:03.844
-I'll keep telling you
-When?

710
01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:06.055
-What's your rush?
-Why did I wait?

711
01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:10.059
You told me to wait!
Now he'll never come again!

712
01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.480
There's a hole in the world
like a great black pit

713
01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.482
And it's filled with people
who are filled with shit

714
01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.735
And the vermin of the world inhabit it

715
01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:22.405
But not for long!

716
01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:29.745
They all deserve to die

717
01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:34.250
Tell you why. Mrs. Lovett
Tell you why

718
01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:37.086
Because in all of
the whole human race. Mrs. Lovett

719
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.547
There are two kinds of men
and only two

720
01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:41.757
There's the one staying put
In his proper place

721
01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:44.135
And the one with his foot
ln the other one's face

722
01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:46.429
Look at me. Mrs. Lovett. look at you!

723
01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:50.850
No. we all deserve to die

724
01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:55.396
Even you. Mrs. Lovett
Even l

725
01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.232
Because the lives of the wicked
should be made brief

726
01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.526
For the rest of us. death will be a relief

727
01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:04.947
We all deserve to die

728
01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:11.162
And l'll never see Johanna

729
01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:17.418
No. I'll never hug my girl to me

730
01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.253
Finished!

731
01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:24.300
All right! You. sir. How about a shave?

732
01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:28.179
Come and visit
your good friend Sweeney.

733
01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:31.140
You. sir. too. sir.
Welcome to the grave!

734
01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:35.227
I will have vengeance

735
01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:40.483
l will have salvation

736
01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:43.402
Who. sir?

737
01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:46.155
You. sir? No one's in the chair.
Come on. come on.

738
01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:49.825
Sweeney's waiting! l want you bleeders.

739
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:53.245
You. sir! Anybody!
Gentlemen. now don't be shy!

740
01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:59.001
Not one man. no. nor ten men

741
01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:05.549
Nor a hundred can assuage me

742
01:04:05.634 --> 01:04:09.595
I will have you

743
01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:13.682
And I will get him back
Even as he gloats

744
01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:17.061
ln the meantime
I'll practice on less honorable throats

745
01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:23.442
And my Lucy lies in ashes

746
01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:30.199
And I'll never see my girl again

747
01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:33.786
But the work waits!

748
01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:37.957
l'm alive at last!

749
01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:44.588
And I'm full ofjoy!

750
01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:53.013
That's all very well.
but what are we gonna do about him?

751
01:04:58.562 --> 01:04:59.853
Hello?

752
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.984
Do you hear me?

753
01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.613
Come on.

754
01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:12.491
You great useless thing.

755
01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:20.332
Sit down.

756
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.187
There. Drink it down.

757
01:05:44.232 --> 01:05:47.860
Now. we got a body
moldering away upstairs.

758
01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:50.863
Now. what do you intend
we should do about that. then?

759
01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:53.240
Later on when it's dark.

760
01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:56.619
we'll take it to some secret place
and bury it.

761
01:05:56.703 --> 01:05:59.371
Oh. yeah. Course we could do that.

762
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.959
Don't suppose he's got any relatives

763
01:06:04.044 --> 01:06:05.961
that's gonna come poking around
looking for him.

764
01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:14.053
Seems a downright shame

765
01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:15.679
Shame?

766
01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:19.558
Seems an awful waste

767
01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:25.564
Such a nice plump frame
What's his name has

768
01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:28.025
Had. has

769
01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:31.236
Nor it can't be traced

770
01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:34.948
Business needs a lift

771
01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:38.243
Debts to be erased

772
01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:42.289
Think of it as thrift. as a gift

773
01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:45.084
lf you get my drift.

774
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:49.129
Seems an awful waste

775
01:06:51.383 --> 01:06:54.551
I mean. with the price of meat what it is

776
01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:57.930
When you get it. if you get it

777
01:06:58.431 --> 01:06:59.598
Good. you got it

778
01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:03.686
Take. for instance
Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop

779
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:07.856
Business never better
using only pussycats and toast

780
01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:11.860
Now a pussy's good for
maybe six or seven at the most

781
01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.862
And I'm sure they can't
compare as far as taste

782
01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:16.532
Mrs. Lovett. what a charming notion
Eminently practical

783
01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:18.909
-And yet appropriate as always
-Well. it does seem a waste

784
01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:21.787
Mrs. Lovett. how I've lived without you
All these years I'll never know!

785
01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:22.871
Think about it

786
01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:24.039
-lots of other gentlemen'll...
-How delectable!

787
01:07:24.124 --> 01:07:25.457
-...soon be coming for a shave
-Also undetectable

788
01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:28.377
-Won't they? Think of all them pies!
-How choice! How rare!

789
01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:32.047
For what's the sound
of the world out there?

790
01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:35.092
What. Mr. Todd. what. Mr. Todd
What is that sound?

791
01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:38.721
Those crunching
noises pervading the air?

792
01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:41.724
Yes. Mr. Todd
Yes. Mr. Todd. yes. all around

793
01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:45.102
It's man devouring man. my dear

794
01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:49.773
-And who are we to deny it in here?
-And who are we to deny it in here?

795
01:07:53.111 --> 01:07:56.029
These are desperate times. Mrs. Lovett.

796
01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:59.658
And desperate measures are called for.

797
01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:03.328
Here we are. hot out of the oven.

798
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.581
What is that?

799
01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:08.709
It's priest
Have a little priest

800
01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:12.212
-Is it really good?
-Sir. it's too good. at least

801
01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:15.591
Then again
they don't commit sins of the flesh

802
01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:17.551
So it's pretty fresh

803
01:08:19.179 --> 01:08:20.846
Awful lot of fat

804
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.431
Only where it sat

805
01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:26.101
Haven't you got poet
or something like that?

806
01:08:26.186 --> 01:08:30.981
No. you see the trouble with poet is
how do you know it's deceased?

807
01:08:31.065 --> 01:08:33.150
Try the priest

808
01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:43.952
Lawyer's rather nice.

809
01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:45.871
If it's for a price

810
01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:50.876
Order something else. though. to follow
Since no one should swallow it twice

811
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.669
Anything that's lean?

812
01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:57.633
Well. then. if you're British and loyal
You might enjoy Royal Marine

813
01:08:57.717 --> 01:08:59.468
Anyway. it's clean

814
01:08:59.552 --> 01:09:02.763
Though. of course
it tastes of wherever it's been

815
01:09:02.847 --> 01:09:06.266
Is that squire on the fire?

816
01:09:06.351 --> 01:09:09.812
Mercy no. sir. look closer
You'll notice it's grocer

817
01:09:09.896 --> 01:09:12.898
Looks thicker
More like vicar

818
01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:16.318
No. it has to be grocer
It's green

819
01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:23.534
The history of the world. my love

820
01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:26.328
Save a lot of graves
Do a lot of relatives favors

821
01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:30.374
Is those below serving those up above

822
01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:33.043
Everybody shaves
So there should be plenty of flavors

823
01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:36.296
How gratifying for once to know

824
01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:37.840
-That those above
-That those above

825
01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:41.927
-Will serve those down below!
-Will serve those down below!

826
01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:49.184
What is that?

827
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:52.688
It's fop
Finest in the shop

828
01:09:52.772 --> 01:09:57.526
Or we have some shepherd's pie
peppered with actual shepherd on top

829
01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.361
And I've just begun

830
01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:04.366
Here's the politician. so oily
It's served with a doily. have one

831
01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.201
Put it on a bun

832
01:10:06.286 --> 01:10:09.705
Well. you never know if it's going to run

833
01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:12.916
Try the friar. fried. it's drier

834
01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:16.795
No. the clergy is really
Too coarse and too mealy

835
01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.048
Then actor
It's compacter

836
01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:23.051
But always arrives overdone

837
01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:26.555
l'll come again
when you have judge on the menu.

838
01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:36.481
Have charity towards the world. my pet

839
01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:39.526
Yes. yes. I know. my love

840
01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:43.238
We'll take the customers
that we can get

841
01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:45.949
High-born and low. my love

842
01:10:46.034 --> 01:10:49.077
We'll not discriminate great from small

843
01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:51.246
No. we'll serve anyone

844
01:10:51.331 --> 01:10:52.915
-We'll serve anyone
-Meaning anyone

845
01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:57.169
-And to anyone at all!
-And to anyone at all!

846
01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:18.065
So. it's true.

847
01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:23.695
Sir. a gentleman knocks
before entering a lady's room.

848
01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:26.573
lndeed he does. but l see no lady.

849
01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:31.954
l told myself the sailor was lying.

850
01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:36.458
that my Johanna would never betray me.
never hurt me so.

851
01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:39.336
Sir. l will leave this place.

852
01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:43.215
l think that only appropriate

853
01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:47.552
since you no longer find
my company to your liking.

854
01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:53.016
We shall provide you with new lodgings.

855
01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:59.648
Until this moment l have spared the rod.

856
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.611
But the ungrateful child
has broken my heart.

857
01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:08.156
When you've learned
to appreciate what you have.

858
01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:09.950
perhaps we shall meet again.

859
01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:11.618
Until then

860
01:12:13.121 --> 01:12:16.039
think on your sins.

861
01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:24.423
No!

862
01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:30.095
No. please!

863
01:12:33.433 --> 01:12:36.601
Johanna! Where are you taking her?
Tell me or l swear l'll...

864
01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.271
You'd kill me. boy? Here l stand!

865
01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:42.607
Johanna!

866
01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:53.428
I feel you

867
01:13:53.513 --> 01:13:57.349
Johanna

868
01:13:57.433 --> 01:14:01.353
I feel you

869
01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:05.565
Do they think that walls can hide you?

870
01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:09.486
Even now. I'm at your window

871
01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:14.032
I am in the dark beside you

872
01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:19.287
Buried sweetly in your yellow hair

873
01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:23.875
Johanna

874
01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:35.470
And are you beautiful and pale

875
01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:38.640
With yellow hair. like her?

876
01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:42.227
I'd want you beautiful and pale

877
01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:48.567
The way I've dreamed you were
Johanna

878
01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:58.410
And if you're beautiful
what then with yellow hair. like wheat

879
01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:02.080
I think we shall not meet again

880
01:15:02.165 --> 01:15:05.167
My little dove. my sweet Johanna

881
01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:11.590
I'll steal you. Johanna!

882
01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:14.050
Goodbye. Johanna!

883
01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:18.180
You're gone. and yet you're mine

884
01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:20.599
l'm fine. Johanna

885
01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:27.439
-l'm fine!
-Johanna

886
01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:40.577
Smoke! Smoke! Sign of the devil
Sign of the devil. City on fire!

887
01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:43.788
Witch! Witch! Smell it. sir
An evil smell

888
01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:45.582
Every night at the vespers bell

889
01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:47.334
Smoke that comes from
the mouth of hell

890
01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:50.378
City on fire!

891
01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:53.715
City on fire

892
01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:57.093
Mischief! Mischief! Mischief!

893
01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:11.983
And if I never hear your voice
My turtledove. my dear

894
01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:17.739
I still have reason to rejoice
The way ahead is clear

895
01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:22.077
Johanna

896
01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:24.871
l feel

897
01:16:24.956 --> 01:16:30.543
And in that darkness when l'm blind
With what I can't forget

898
01:16:30.628 --> 01:16:31.670
Johanna

899
01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:34.798
It's always morning in my mind

900
01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:41.179
My little lamb. my pet. Johanna

901
01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:47.352
-You stay. Johanna...
-Johanna

902
01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:50.188
...the way I've dreamed you are

903
01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:54.276
Oh. look. Johanna! A star!

904
01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:58.947
Buried sweetly in your yellow hair

905
01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:02.492
A shooting star!

906
01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:10.292
There. there. somebody. somebody
look up there. Didn't I tell you?

907
01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:14.296
Smell that air. City on fire!

908
01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:17.299
Quick. sir. run and tell
Warn them all of the witch's spell

909
01:17:17.383 --> 01:17:19.050
There it is. there it is. the unholy smell

910
01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.344
Tell it to the Beadle and police as well
Tell them! Tell them

911
01:17:21.429 --> 01:17:25.307
Help. fiend! City on fire!

912
01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:28.810
City on fire

913
01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:30.729
Mischief. Mischief.

914
01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:46.995
And though I'll think of you. I guess
Until the day I die

915
01:17:47.079 --> 01:17:52.792
I think I miss you less and less
As every day goes by

916
01:17:52.877 --> 01:17:59.632
-Johanna
-Johanna

917
01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:06.056
And you'd be beautiful and pale
And look too much like her

918
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:11.853
If only angels could prevail
We'd be the way we were

919
01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:18.818
-Johanna
-I feel you. Johanna

920
01:18:18.903 --> 01:18:21.946
Wake up. Johanna

921
01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:25.158
Another bright red day

922
01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:31.956
We learn. Johanna. to say

923
01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:35.126
Goodbye

924
01:18:38.798 --> 01:18:42.384
l'll steal

925
01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:50.308
you

926
01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:31.558
Ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention. please?

927
01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:35.103
Are your nostrils a-quiver
and tingling as well

928
01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:38.273
At that delicate
luscious ambrosial smell?

929
01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:40.483
Yes. they are. I can tell

930
01:19:40.568 --> 01:19:44.446
Well. ladies and gentlemen
That aroma enriching the breeze

931
01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:46.448
Is like nothing
compared to its succulent source

932
01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:50.243
As the gourmets among you
will tell you. of course

933
01:19:50.327 --> 01:19:55.206
Ladies and gentlemen
You can't imagine the rapture in store

934
01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:58.543
Just inside of this door!

935
01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:06.259
There you'll sample
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies

936
01:20:06.343 --> 01:20:09.804
Savory and sweet pies
As you'll see

937
01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:13.391
You who eat pies
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies

938
01:20:13.476 --> 01:20:17.020
Conjure up the treat
pies used to be!

939
01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:22.484
-Toby!
-Coming!

940
01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:25.278
-Ale there!
-Right. ma'am!

941
01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:26.779
Quick. now!

942
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:31.659
Nice to see you. dearie
How have you been keeping?

943
01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:35.330
Cor. me bones is weary
Toby! One for the gentleman

944
01:20:35.414 --> 01:20:39.000
Hear the birdies cheeping
Helps to keep it cheery

945
01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:42.545
Toby! Throw the old woman out!

946
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:46.466
What's my secret?
Frankly. dear. forgive my candor

947
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:50.011
Family secret
All to do with herbs

948
01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:53.598
Things like being
careful with your coriander

949
01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:56.434
That's what makes the gravy grander!

950
01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:09.822
Eat them slow and feel the crust
How thin she rolled it

951
01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:13.535
Eat them slow
'cause every one's a prize!

952
01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:17.080
Eat them slow 'cause that's the lot
and now we've sold it!

953
01:21:17.164 --> 01:21:18.456
Come again tomorrow!

954
01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:19.874
Hold it!

955
01:21:20.834 --> 01:21:22.961
Bless my eyes!

956
01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:26.506
Fresh supplies!

957
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:27.966
-How about it. dearie?
-Is that a pie...

958
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.884
-Be here in a twinkling!
-...fit for a king

959
01:21:29.969 --> 01:21:32.595
-Just confirms me theory. Toby!
-A wondrous sweet

960
01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.888
-and most delectable thing?
-God watches over us

961
01:21:33.973 --> 01:21:35.682
Didn't have an inkling. positively eerie

962
01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:37.058
You see. ma'am
why there's no meat pie

963
01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:39.852
Toby! Throw the old woman out!

964
01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:51.197
Still got to keep an eye
on the household expenditure.

965
01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:55.451
Which isn't to say we couldn't get
some nice taxidermy animals.

966
01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:57.870
bring a touch of gentility to the place.

967
01:21:57.955 --> 01:22:00.498
You know. a boar's head or two?

968
01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:05.461
-Mr. T? You listening to me?
-Of course.

969
01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:11.092
-Then what did l just say?
-There must be a way to the Judge.

970
01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:14.345
Judge. Always harping
on the bloody old judge.

971
01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:17.599
We got a nice
respectable business now.

972
01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:19.601
Money coming in regular-like.

973
01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.394
And since we're careful
to pick and choose.

974
01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:25.690
strangers. people who won't be missed.
who's gonna catch on?

975
01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.444
Mr. Todd. I'm so happy

976
01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:31.654
I could eat you up. I really could

977
01:22:31.739 --> 01:22:34.991
You know what l'd like to do. Mr. Todd?
What l dream?

978
01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:38.828
If the business stays as good
Where I'd really like to go

979
01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:43.750
In a year or so?
Don't you want to know?

980
01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:44.959
Of course.

981
01:22:45.044 --> 01:22:46.919
Do you really want to know?

982
01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:48.921
Yes. l do.

983
01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:06.648
By the sea. Mr. Todd
That's the life l'll covet

984
01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:09.609
By the sea. Mr. Todd
Oh. l know you'd love it

985
01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:14.739
You and me. Mr. T. we could be alone
ln a house what we'd almost own

986
01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:18.076
-Down by the sea
-Anything you say

987
01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.995
Wouldn't that be smashing?

988
01:23:21.872 --> 01:23:24.999
Think how snug it'll be
Underneath our flannel

989
01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:28.086
When it's just you and me
And the English Channel

990
01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:31.005
In our cozy retreat
Kept all neat and tidy

991
01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:36.260
We'll have chums over every Friday
By the sea

992
01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:41.891
Don't you love the weather
by the sea?

993
01:23:42.726 --> 01:23:45.853
We'll grow old together

994
01:23:46.105 --> 01:23:50.608
By the seaside
By the beautiful sea

995
01:23:55.698 --> 01:23:58.700
It'll be so quiet that who'll come by it

996
01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:01.160
except a seagull?

997
01:24:01.995 --> 01:24:06.457
We shouldn't try it
though. till it's legal for two!

998
01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:10.962
But a seaside wedding could be devised

999
01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:13.881
Me rumpled bedding legitimized

1000
01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:19.637
Me eyelids'll flutter. I'll turn into butter
The moment l mutter "l do!"

1001
01:24:19.722 --> 01:24:23.433
Will you take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1002
01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:29.605
You may kiss your bride.

1003
01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:47.832
Down by the sea
Married nice and proper

1004
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.629
By the sea
Bring along your chopper

1005
01:24:53.714 --> 01:25:00.219
To the seaside
By the beautiful sea

1006
01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:21.073
l brought you some breakfast. dear.

1007
01:25:24.912 --> 01:25:27.997
Mr. T? Can l ask you a question?

1008
01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:30.291
What?

1009
01:25:31.335 --> 01:25:33.669
What did your Lucy look like?

1010
01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:38.883
Can't really remember. can you?

1011
01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:42.178
She had yellow hair.

1012
01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:47.016
You gotta leave this all behind.
you know.

1013
01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:50.394
She's gone.

1014
01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:54.398
Life is for the alive. my dear.

1015
01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:58.236
We could have a life. us two.

1016
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.404
Maybe not like l dreamed.

1017
01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:03.616
Maybe not like you remember.

1018
01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.494
But we could get by.

1019
01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:19.215
-Mr. Todd! Mrs. Lovett. ma'am?
-What is it. Anthony?

1020
01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:23.177
-He has her locked in a madhouse.
-Johanna.

1021
01:26:23.262 --> 01:26:24.762
Fogg's Asylum.

1022
01:26:24.847 --> 01:26:29.642
l've circled the place a dozen times.
There's no way in. lt's a fortress.

1023
01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:32.645
-l've got him.
-Mr. Todd?

1024
01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:35.565
We've got her.

1025
01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:38.234
Where do you suppose
all the wigmakers

1026
01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:40.778
in London go to obtain their hair?

1027
01:26:41.572 --> 01:26:42.822
Bedlam.

1028
01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:47.493
-They get it from the lunatics at Bedlam.
-l don't understand.

1029
01:26:48.954 --> 01:26:52.039
We shall set you up
as a wigmaker's apprentice.

1030
01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:55.293
That'll gain you access.
And then you take her.

1031
01:26:55.961 --> 01:26:57.670
Go. quickly. go!

1032
01:26:59.131 --> 01:27:00.590
Fetch the boy.

1033
01:27:00.674 --> 01:27:04.051
Don't you think you should
leave the boy behind?

1034
01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:22.695
-Toby. Mr. Todd needs you.
-Yes. ma'am.

1035
01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:37.001
Mr. T?

1036
01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:43.549
-Do you know where the Old Bailey is?
-Yes. sir. Not that l ever been there.

1037
01:27:43.634 --> 01:27:47.762
Take this there.
Seek out a Judge Turpin. Repeat that.

1038
01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:50.306
Go to Old Bailey. Find Judge Turpin.

1039
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:53.851
You put that into his hands.
Only to him. you understand?

1040
01:27:53.936 --> 01:27:55.061
Yes. sir.

1041
01:27:55.145 --> 01:27:57.438
And while l'm out. do you mind
if l stop by the grocerjust to pick...

1042
01:27:57.522 --> 01:28:00.191
No. You're not to stop.
you're not to speak.

1043
01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:02.902
You're to deliver the letter.
Do you understand?

1044
01:28:02.986 --> 01:28:04.528
Yes. sir.

1045
01:28:34.685 --> 01:28:36.143
Where you been. lad?

1046
01:28:36.228 --> 01:28:40.940
We had quite the rush at dinner time.
Me poor bones is ready to drop.

1047
01:28:41.024 --> 01:28:43.317
Mr. Todd sent me on an errand.

1048
01:28:43.402 --> 01:28:44.443
And on the way back.

1049
01:28:44.528 --> 01:28:47.405
l went by the workhouse.
just to take a look.

1050
01:28:47.489 --> 01:28:51.325
And l was thinking. but for you.
l'd be there now.

1051
01:28:52.411 --> 01:28:54.203
Or someplace worse.

1052
01:28:54.287 --> 01:28:56.330
Seems like the good Lord
sent you for me.

1053
01:28:56.415 --> 01:28:59.792
Oh. love. l feel quite the same way.

1054
01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:01.794
Listen to me. please.

1055
01:29:01.878 --> 01:29:04.171
You know there's nothing
l wouldn't do for you.

1056
01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:07.425
Say. if there were someone around.

1057
01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:10.094
someone bad?

1058
01:29:10.637 --> 01:29:13.055
Only you didn't know it.

1059
01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:16.934
What is this?
What are you talking about?

1060
01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:25.526
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while l'm around

1061
01:29:26.945 --> 01:29:32.491
Nothing's gonna harm you
No. sir. not while l'm around

1062
01:29:32.576 --> 01:29:34.118
What do you mean "someone bad"?

1063
01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:40.791
Demons are prowling everywhere
nowadays

1064
01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:47.882
I'll send them howling. I don't care
I got ways

1065
01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:52.094
Hush. darling. there's no need for this.

1066
01:29:53.805 --> 01:30:00.186
No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna dare

1067
01:30:01.438 --> 01:30:07.109
Others can desert you
Not to worry. whistle. I'll be there

1068
01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:11.697
Demons will charm you
With a smile

1069
01:30:11.782 --> 01:30:17.578
For a while. but in time

1070
01:30:17.662 --> 01:30:20.498
Nothing can harm you

1071
01:30:21.666 --> 01:30:26.837
Not while l'm around

1072
01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:32.134
That's nice. dear.

1073
01:30:32.803 --> 01:30:37.473
Now. what is all this foolishness?
What are you talking about?

1074
01:30:38.183 --> 01:30:42.061
Little things that
l've been thinking about Mr. Todd.

1075
01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:48.025
Not to worry. not to worry
I may not be smart. but I ain't dumb

1076
01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:54.532
I can do it. put me to it
Show me something l can overcome

1077
01:30:55.742 --> 01:30:59.829
Not to worry. ma'am

1078
01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:07.128
Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true

1079
01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:13.717
l don't need to. l won't never
Hide a thing from you

1080
01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:17.221
Like some

1081
01:31:18.974 --> 01:31:23.185
Now. Toby. dear. haven't we
had enough of this foolish chatter?

1082
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:24.645
Here.

1083
01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:29.900
How about l give you
a nice shiny new penny

1084
01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:32.736
and you go get us some toffees?

1085
01:31:35.073 --> 01:31:36.740
That's Signor Pirelli's purse!

1086
01:31:36.825 --> 01:31:39.660
No. it's not. Just something Mr. T
gave me for my birthday.

1087
01:31:39.744 --> 01:31:41.662
That proves it! We gotta go. ma'am.

1088
01:31:41.746 --> 01:31:43.914
We gotta find the Beadle
and get the law here!

1089
01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.876
Toby. Hush. lad.
you're not going anywhere.

1090
01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:52.006
You just sit here. nice and quiet.
next to me. That's right. right.

1091
01:31:54.885 --> 01:31:57.553
How could you think
such a thing of Mr. Todd?

1092
01:31:57.637 --> 01:32:00.222
He's been so good to us.

1093
01:32:04.394 --> 01:32:10.941
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while l'm around

1094
01:32:12.736 --> 01:32:18.282
Nothing's gonna harm you. darling
Not while l'm around

1095
01:32:19.492 --> 01:32:25.206
Demons'll charm you with a smile
For a while

1096
01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:28.417
But in time

1097
01:32:28.501 --> 01:32:32.546
Nothing's gonna harm you

1098
01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:38.302
Not while l'm around

1099
01:32:42.015 --> 01:32:45.017
Funny we should be having
this little chat right now.

1100
01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:47.311
'Cause l was just thinking...

1101
01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:50.856
You know how you've always fancied
coming into the bake house with me

1102
01:32:50.941 --> 01:32:54.109
-to help make the pies?
-Yes. ma'am.

1103
01:32:54.236 --> 01:32:58.614
Well. no time like the present. eh?

1104
01:33:18.468 --> 01:33:21.929
l feel bad for you. going up
and down all these stairs.

1105
01:33:22.013 --> 01:33:25.849
-Well. that'll be yourjob now.
-Yes. ma'am.

1106
01:33:30.230 --> 01:33:32.523
Quite a stink. ain't there?

1107
01:33:36.236 --> 01:33:37.611
You see those grates?

1108
01:33:37.696 --> 01:33:40.489
They go right down to the sewers.
and the smells come up.

1109
01:33:40.573 --> 01:33:42.992
Always a few rats gone home
to Jesus down there.

1110
01:33:43.076 --> 01:33:46.996
Now. this'll be the bake oven.
Three dozen at a time.

1111
01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:49.873
Always be sure
the door is closed properly. like this.

1112
01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:53.585
-Door's closed properly.
-This is a grinder.

1113
01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:57.548
Pop in the meat. Give it a good grind.

1114
01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.511
Pops out there.

1115
01:34:04.389 --> 01:34:05.764
You try.

1116
01:34:07.434 --> 01:34:08.726
Good grind.

1117
01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:12.062
Comes out there.

1118
01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:15.399
That's my boy.

1119
01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:18.319
l'm just gonna pop upstairs.
back in two shakes. all right?

1120
01:34:18.403 --> 01:34:21.655
You mind if l have a pie while l wait?

1121
01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:23.782
As many as you like. son.

1122
01:34:36.588 --> 01:34:37.963
Yes. sir. l agree.

1123
01:34:38.048 --> 01:34:39.506
lt would be to our mutual interest

1124
01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:43.552
to come to some arrangement
in regard to my poor children's hair.

1125
01:34:43.636 --> 01:34:45.095
Brunettes.

1126
01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:48.182
Redheads.

1127
01:34:50.852 --> 01:34:53.354
l keep the blondes in here.

1128
01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:56.023
lt was yellow hair
you was looking for. sir?

1129
01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:57.483
Yes.

1130
01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:32.643
-That one there has the shade l need.
-Come. child.

1131
01:35:39.317 --> 01:35:42.861
Smile for the gentleman
and you shall have a sweetie.

1132
01:35:44.823 --> 01:35:47.157
Now. where shall l cut?

1133
01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:51.912
Not another word. Mr. Fogg.
or it will be your last.

1134
01:35:53.832 --> 01:35:58.710
Now. l leave you
to the mercy of your children.

1135
01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:12.433
l got him locked in.
But if he escapes. he'll go to the law.

1136
01:36:12.517 --> 01:36:14.768
-Then he won't escape.
-l don't know. Mr. Todd.

1137
01:36:14.853 --> 01:36:17.187
The Judge'll be here soon.

1138
01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:21.567
'Scuse me. sir. Gave me a fright.

1139
01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:24.695
Not my intention. good madam.
l assure you.

1140
01:36:25.405 --> 01:36:28.449
Though l am here on official business.

1141
01:36:29.075 --> 01:36:34.371
You see. there's been some complaints
about the stink from your chimney.

1142
01:36:34.456 --> 01:36:37.541
They say at night
it is something most foul.

1143
01:36:38.376 --> 01:36:41.462
Health regulations
and the general public welfare

1144
01:36:41.546 --> 01:36:43.464
naturally being my duty.

1145
01:36:43.548 --> 01:36:46.717
l'm afraid l'm gonna have to take a look

1146
01:36:49.554 --> 01:36:51.305
at your bakehouse.

1147
01:36:52.682 --> 01:36:54.183
Of course. sir.

1148
01:36:54.267 --> 01:36:57.978
But first. why don't you come upstairs?
Let me pamper you.

1149
01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:02.649
Much as l do appreciate
tonsorial doormen

1150
01:37:02.734 --> 01:37:05.235
l really ought to see
to my official obligations first.

1151
01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:07.362
l completely understand.

1152
01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:15.287
lf you'll indulge me. sir.
what is that exotic aroma?

1153
01:37:18.249 --> 01:37:21.293
Me secret. is a touch of ambergris.

1154
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:25.339
Dare l offer you something
a tad more appropriate

1155
01:37:25.423 --> 01:37:27.841
for a gentleman of your standing?

1156
01:37:27.926 --> 01:37:30.886
The ladies will greatly appreciate it. sir.

1157
01:37:33.723 --> 01:37:37.017
You're the expert in these matters.

1158
01:37:37.101 --> 01:37:39.061
Only take a moment.

1159
01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:45.692
Would you like a bit of bay rum. sir?

1160
01:37:45.777 --> 01:37:48.070
Bay rum is very bracing.

1161
01:38:53.845 --> 01:38:57.514
Let me out! Please. let me out!

1162
01:39:00.268 --> 01:39:01.935
Let me out!

1163
01:39:19.537 --> 01:39:20.746
Toby?

1164
01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.124
Where is he?

1165
01:39:28.212 --> 01:39:33.091
Toby. where are you. love?

1166
01:39:35.178 --> 01:39:36.470
Toby?

1167
01:39:40.391 --> 01:39:44.061
Nothing's gonna harm you

1168
01:39:44.145 --> 01:39:47.397
Not while l'm around

1169
01:39:47.482 --> 01:39:48.774
Toby?

1170
01:39:50.568 --> 01:39:52.903
Where are you hiding?

1171
01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:55.572
Toby?

1172
01:39:56.741 --> 01:39:59.993
Nothing's gonna harm you. darling

1173
01:40:02.455 --> 01:40:05.082
Not while l'm around

1174
01:40:09.087 --> 01:40:10.420
Toby?

1175
01:40:12.507 --> 01:40:13.965
Mr. Todd!

1176
01:40:15.968 --> 01:40:17.594
You wait for him here.

1177
01:40:17.679 --> 01:40:21.181
l'll return with a coach
in less than half an hour.

1178
01:40:21.265 --> 01:40:25.769
Don't worry. No one'll recognize you.
You're safe now.

1179
01:40:26.771 --> 01:40:31.608
Safe? So. we run away
and then all our dreams come true?

1180
01:40:32.694 --> 01:40:34.403
l hope so.

1181
01:40:35.154 --> 01:40:38.407
l've never had dreams. Only nightmares.

1182
01:40:39.367 --> 01:40:40.784
Johanna.

1183
01:40:41.494 --> 01:40:44.996
when we're free of this place
all the ghosts will go away.

1184
01:40:45.081 --> 01:40:48.542
No. Anthony. They never go away.

1185
01:40:49.585 --> 01:40:53.338
l'll be right back to you.
Half an hour and we'll be free.

1186
01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:31.418
Beadle! Beadle!

1187
01:41:32.587 --> 01:41:37.382
No good hiding. I saw you

1188
01:41:37.467 --> 01:41:42.429
Are you in there still. Beadle?
Beadle?

1189
01:41:42.513 --> 01:41:45.348
Beadle. dear Beadle?

1190
01:41:47.477 --> 01:41:50.604
Beadle deedle deedle
deedle deedle dumpling

1191
01:41:50.688 --> 01:41:52.939
Beadle dumpling...

1192
01:41:59.906 --> 01:42:02.991
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1193
01:42:05.203 --> 01:42:06.703
Evil is here. sir.

1194
01:42:06.788 --> 01:42:11.416
The stink of evil. from below. from her!
Oh. she's the Devil's wife.

1195
01:42:11.501 --> 01:42:15.545
Beware her. sir.
She with no pity in her heart.

1196
01:42:17.507 --> 01:42:20.383
Don't l know you. mister?

1197
01:42:20.468 --> 01:42:21.968
Mr. Todd?

1198
01:42:33.397 --> 01:42:34.981
Where is she?

1199
01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.027
Below. Your Honor. With my neighbor.

1200
01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:43.573
Thank heavens
the sailor did not molest her.

1201
01:42:43.658 --> 01:42:48.245
Thank heavens. too.
she has seen the error of her ways.

1202
01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:51.414
-She has?
-Oh. yes.

1203
01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:54.543
Your lesson was well-learned.

1204
01:42:54.627 --> 01:42:58.755
She speaks only of you.
Longing for forgiveness.

1205
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:02.759
Then she shall have it.

1206
01:43:03.761 --> 01:43:07.180
-She'll be here soon. you say?
-Yes.

1207
01:43:07.765 --> 01:43:09.766
Excellent. my friend.

1208
01:43:11.727 --> 01:43:13.436
How about a shave?

1209
01:43:14.772 --> 01:43:16.773
Sit. sir. Sit.

1210
01:43:19.735 --> 01:43:25.782
-Oh. pretty women
-Pretty women. yes

1211
01:43:25.867 --> 01:43:28.952
Johanna. Johanna

1212
01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:32.664
Pretty women
Pretty women are a wonder

1213
01:43:32.748 --> 01:43:34.374
Pretty women!

1214
01:43:34.458 --> 01:43:37.377
What we do for pretty women!

1215
01:43:37.461 --> 01:43:41.131
-Blowing out their candles
-Blowing out their candles

1216
01:43:41.215 --> 01:43:44.843
-Or combing out their hair
-Or combing out their hair

1217
01:43:44.927 --> 01:43:46.636
Then they leave

1218
01:43:46.721 --> 01:43:50.307
-Even when they leave
-Even when they leave you and vanish

1219
01:43:50.391 --> 01:43:53.310
-They still are there
-They somehow can still remain

1220
01:43:53.394 --> 01:43:58.356
-There with you. there
-They're there

1221
01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:02.736
How seldom it is
one meets a fellow spirit.

1222
01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:07.157
With fellow tastes in women. at least.

1223
01:44:07.909 --> 01:44:09.409
What's that?

1224
01:44:10.286 --> 01:44:13.204
The years. no doubt.
have changed me. sir.

1225
01:44:13.289 --> 01:44:16.207
But then. l suppose the face of a barber.

1226
01:44:16.292 --> 01:44:20.378
the face of a prisoner.
a dog. is not particularly memorable.

1227
01:44:27.094 --> 01:44:29.554
Benjamin Barker.

1228
01:44:29.847 --> 01:44:32.724
Benjamin Barker!

1229
01:45:10.554 --> 01:45:14.057
Rest now. my friend

1230
01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:20.397
Rest now forever

1231
01:45:21.857 --> 01:45:27.153
Sleep now the untroubled

1232
01:45:27.238 --> 01:45:32.826
Sleep of the angels

1233
01:45:43.963 --> 01:45:46.089
Come for a shave. have you. lad?

1234
01:45:46.173 --> 01:45:47.799
No. l...

1235
01:45:51.637 --> 01:45:54.431
Everyone needs a good shave.

1236
01:46:01.605 --> 01:46:03.732
Forget my face.

1237
01:46:07.528 --> 01:46:10.780
Die! God in heaven. die!

1238
01:46:24.628 --> 01:46:26.129
You.

1239
01:46:35.056 --> 01:46:36.890
Why did you scream?

1240
01:46:36.974 --> 01:46:39.934
He was clutching onto me dress.
but he's finished now.

1241
01:46:40.019 --> 01:46:42.479
l'll take care of it. Open the door.

1242
01:46:42.563 --> 01:46:44.898
Open the door. l said.

1243
01:47:39.036 --> 01:47:41.704
"Don't l know you?" she said.

1244
01:47:51.423 --> 01:47:53.299
You knew she lived.

1245
01:47:55.219 --> 01:47:57.554
l was only thinking of you.

1246
01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:03.101
You lied to me.

1247
01:48:03.185 --> 01:48:06.771
No. no. not lied at all
No. l never lied

1248
01:48:06.856 --> 01:48:08.523
-Lucy...
-Said she took a poison

1249
01:48:08.607 --> 01:48:10.525
she did. never said that she died

1250
01:48:10.609 --> 01:48:12.819
-I've come home again
-Poor thing. she lived

1251
01:48:12.903 --> 01:48:14.195
But it left her weak in the head

1252
01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:16.781
All she did for months
was just lie there in bed

1253
01:48:16.866 --> 01:48:18.241
Should've been in hospital

1254
01:48:18.325 --> 01:48:21.077
Wound up in Bedlam instead
Poor thing!

1255
01:48:21.162 --> 01:48:23.413
-Better you should think she was dead
-Oh. my God!

1256
01:48:23.497 --> 01:48:26.374
Yes. I lied 'cause I love you!

1257
01:48:26.458 --> 01:48:29.210
-l'd be twice the wife she was!
-Lucy...

1258
01:48:29.295 --> 01:48:31.629
-I love you!
-What have l done?

1259
01:48:31.714 --> 01:48:34.924
Could that thing have
cared for you like me?

1260
01:48:35.009 --> 01:48:38.094
Mrs. Lovett. you're a bloody wonder
Eminently practical

1261
01:48:38.179 --> 01:48:40.972
And yet appropriate as always
As you've said repeatedly

1262
01:48:41.056 --> 01:48:42.724
There's little point in dwelling
on the past

1263
01:48:42.808 --> 01:48:43.808
-Now. come here. my love...
-Do you mean it?

1264
01:48:43.893 --> 01:48:45.143
Everything I did. I swear. I thought

1265
01:48:45.227 --> 01:48:46.477
-Was only for the best
-Not a thing to fear

1266
01:48:46.604 --> 01:48:50.148
-my love. what's dead Is dead
-Can we still be married?

1267
01:48:50.232 --> 01:48:53.193
The history of the world. my pet

1268
01:48:53.277 --> 01:48:56.446
Oh. Mr. Todd. oh. Mr. Todd
Leave it to me

1269
01:48:56.530 --> 01:48:59.824
Is learn forgiveness and try to forget

1270
01:48:59.909 --> 01:49:01.576
By the sea. Mr. Todd
We'll be comfy-cozy

1271
01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:03.369
By the sea. Mr. Todd
Where there's no one nosy

1272
01:49:03.454 --> 01:49:08.708
And life is for the alive. my dear
So let's keep living it

1273
01:49:08.792 --> 01:49:13.630
-Just keep living it. really living it!
-Just keep living it. really living it!

1274
01:50:00.094 --> 01:50:04.180
There was a barber and his wife

1275
01:50:05.516 --> 01:50:09.978
And she was beautiful

1276
01:50:12.523 --> 01:50:16.859
A foolish barber and his wife

1277
01:50:17.695 --> 01:50:22.156
She was his reason and his life

1278
01:50:22.908 --> 01:50:27.370
And she was beautiful

1279
01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:32.709
And she was virtuous

1280
01:50:34.878 --> 01:50:38.172
And he was...
