TODAY'S AGENDA

7
00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:13.083
THE CONFERENCE

8
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:21.041
All through the town

9
00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:24.708
The doors of the bus
Are opened and shut

10
00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:28.416
Opened and shut

11
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.625
The doors of the bus
Are opened and shut

12
00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:35.416
All through the town

13
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.041
The driver of the bus says
Go back in the bus

14
00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.333
Go back in the bus

15
00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:42.875
All through the town

16
00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.208
Are we there?

17
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:47.833
Okay. guys.
We'll be making a short stop soon.

18
00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:50.750
The dad on the bus goes
Hush. hush. hush

19
00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:57.791
All through the town

20
00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:02.833
Okay. guys. it's about to become reality.

21
00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.833
Kolarängen shopping mall.

22
00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:08.125
Not bad for a bunch of municipal workers

23
00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:12.000
who just make coffee
and fill out forms all day.

24
00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:14.583
No. joking aside.

25
00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:17.583
tomorrow will be a historic day
for the municipality.

26
00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:20.708
When the ground is broken
in front of the press.

27
00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:24.000
we should be proud
of all the amazing opportunities

28
00:03:24.083 --> 00:03:26.333
that the mall will give Kolarängen.

29
00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:29.875
So. fasten your seatbelts.
'cause here we go!

30
00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:35.583
Now that we've all gathered here.

31
00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:38.375
I'd like to draw attention to the person

32
00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:43.291
who. despite all the difficulties.
has made this project a reality.

33
00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:46.125
And I'm talking about you. Jonas.

34
00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:48.833
The king!

35
00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:50.583
Awesome as hell!

36
00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:53.125
You really fought for this!

37
00:03:53.708 --> 00:03:56.125
Yeah.

38
00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:59.500
Well. being a project manager…

39
00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:04.083
Strange expression.

40
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:08.333
Project. Manager.

41
00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:11.958
To manage a project…

42
00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:16.583
That's what I've done.
And I couldn't have done it without you.

43
00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:21.583
Especially not without you. Ingela.
Your trust in me has been invaluable.

44
00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:22.958
Thank you. Jonas.

45
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:25.208
Now let's all enjoy ourselves.

46
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:28.708
We're going to socialize
and get to know each other better.

47
00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:31.291
And we'll indulge in some luxury.

48
00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:35.083
We're going to combine work and pleasure.
especially pleasure.

49
00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:36.166
Yeah!

50
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.541
If anyone asks. we're here
for "competence development."

51
00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:43.750
It's a requirement
to make it tax-deductible.

52
00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:46.291
-That's right.
-Very important. Thank you.

53
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.291
Kaj?

54
00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:56.333
-Should I take a picture?
-What a journey.

55
00:05:31.208 --> 00:05:34.458
KOLARSJÖN HOLIDAY VILLAGE

56
00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:52.125
Would you look at this bunch!

57
00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:54.958
Hello and welcome
to Kolarsjön Holiday Village!

58
00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:58.708
Hi. I'm Jenny. This is Roger.

59
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:01.458
If you need anything. ask him. Or me.

60
00:06:01.541 --> 00:06:04.875
Or both of us.
But if your toilet is blocked. ask Roger.

61
00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:06.750
Hi there. Welcome.

62
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.041
This is Cleo. She'll take care of you
during the team-building exercise.

63
00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:14.916
I hope you brought durable clothes.
'cause we're going to have fun!

64
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.166
And here's Karl. our chef.

65
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.458
I hope you brought Imodium.

66
00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:22.125
Nah…

67
00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:24.791
I'm just kidding. of course.

68
00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:29.916
Anyway. we work closely
with our local grocery store…

69
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.375
Who the hell brought fireworks
and put them on my bags?

70
00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:34.666
Those are mine.

71
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.583
-What for?
-Surprise. For the gang. later.

72
00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:43.125
-Okay. so tonight we'll serve a…
-We can go over that later.

73
00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:44.333
Great. Karl.

74
00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:49.416
But now. let's go up to the guesthouse
to get you your cabin keys.

75
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.375
Come with me.

76
00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:54.166
Yeah… Here is the…

77
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.000
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

78
00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:57.083
Fuck!

79
00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:58.833
Excuse me.

80
00:06:58.916 --> 00:07:03.208
I've just returned to work
after taking some time off. so…

81
00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:05.291
Oh. how nice.

82
00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:10.333
Yeah. and I've been told
to avoid unnecessary stress.

83
00:07:10.416 --> 00:07:12.250
This durable clothes thing…

84
00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:16.333
There'll be no unnecessary stress.
It'll be nice and relaxed and fun.

85
00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:17.875
Don't you worry.

86
00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.000
Let's see.

87
00:07:19.083 --> 00:07:22.500
We have Eva and Lina.
You'll share cabin one.

88
00:07:22.583 --> 00:07:25.291
Aren't we a bit too old
for a pajama party? No?

89
00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:28.375
And then we have Jonas and…

90
00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:30.333
Ka-ka-ka-Kajan!

91
00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:32.916
-Yes. cabin number two.
-Número dos.

92
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.125
-Then we have Amir and Torbjörn.
-Congrats. Amir.

93
00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:37.541
-Cabin three.
-Thank you.

94
00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:39.291
Nadja and Anette in four…

95
00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:42.041
Excuse me. who decided
the living arrangements?

96
00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:44.083
You're grouped by astrological signs.

97
00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:46.541
You're a Cancer. You fit with a Scorpio.

98
00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:48.541
-I'm a Scorpio.
-I'm a Cancer.

99
00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:50.708
How exciting! Astrological signs.

100
00:07:50.791 --> 00:07:54.791
That means. Ingela. that you're
by yourself in our luxury cabin.

101
00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:58.541
We're an uneven number.
so someone had to sacrifice themselves.

102
00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:00.916
Look. Anette. This is cultural history.

103
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.583
They weren't afraid
to roll up their sleeves.

104
00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:05.625
-No.
-Look how dirty he is.

105
00:08:05.708 --> 00:08:07.208
Who are these stars?

106
00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:10.416
It's nice that someone is on our side
after all the fuss.

107
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.583
Fuss? More like an uprising.
All the complaints and reports…

108
00:08:14.666 --> 00:08:18.000
I don't think people understand
what this means.

109
00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:22.291
We think the mall will be a boost
for our municipality and for us…

110
00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:24.291
I mean. we've already read this.

111
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:27.000
-Yeah…
-Why do you think we're here?

112
00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:29.416
Maybe because nobody else wants us.

113
00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.750
Roger!

114
00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:09.250
Dammit!

115
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.125
-Where are you going?
-To fill up the gas. It's Roger's job.

116
00:09:20.208 --> 00:09:21.125
Where is he?

117
00:09:21.208 --> 00:09:24.958
In the cabins. finishing up.
But they're having lunch in two hours!

118
00:09:30.416 --> 00:09:35.208
…a petition where the majority
vote against the shopping mall.

119
00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:39.000
But there are no plans
to stop construction.

120
00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:41.041
according to Backmann-Kroon.

121
00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:44.625
Groundbreaking will happen tomorrow.
in front of the press.

122
00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:47.625
with representatives
from the exploitation group…

123
00:09:51.916 --> 00:09:53.375
What the hell?

124
00:10:26.916 --> 00:10:27.916
Damn.

125
00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:32.541
-Sorry.
-What?

126
00:10:32.625 --> 00:10:34.541
Vindaloo. it just…

127
00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:38.750
-Oh. No. it's not you.
-There's no toilet paper. if you're going.

128
00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:42.250
Thanks. It's the cabin.
It smells like old. moldy cardboard.

129
00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:45.000
-Do you smell it?
-This is so damn depressing.

130
00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:49.000
But the standard will be higher
at next year's conference. right?

131
00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:50.541
Beer?

132
00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:55.375
I heard that Backmann-Kroon
flew their entire crew to Dubai last year.

133
00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:59.125
Don't talk too much about that
before it's official.

134
00:10:59.916 --> 00:11:01.083
Okay.

135
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.000
But it will happen. right?

136
00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:11.125
Of course it will.

137
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:19.208
Did you see today's agenda?

138
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:22.000
-Environmental goals…
-Will you play guitar. Torbjörn?

139
00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:23.375
Yeah. but it's sold out.

140
00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:27.791
-Guns N' Roses?
-We don't have environmental goals.

141
00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:30.458
You can't have a conference facility
without Wi-Fi.

142
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:32.541
-No…
-No. you can't.

143
00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:36.375
We do have Wi-Fi.
It's just a bit unstable at times.

144
00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:37.833
We'll sort it out!

145
00:11:37.916 --> 00:11:39.375
-Roger. stop.
-What?

146
00:11:39.458 --> 00:11:41.500
-Go fix the internet.
-Again?

147
00:11:41.583 --> 00:11:43.083
-Yes!
-Is this a joke?

148
00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:44.458
-Hurry. please!
-Yes.

149
00:11:49.666 --> 00:11:51.666
"WE WON'T GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT"

150
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.500
KOLARÄNGEN SHOPPING MALL

151
00:12:17.333 --> 00:12:20.291
More and more families
report an increased threat

152
00:12:20.375 --> 00:12:24.750
to the safety we should be able
to take for granted in our society.

153
00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:27.958
In a world characterized
by gang-related crime.

154
00:12:28.041 --> 00:12:31.000
it's difficult to find a place
to call home.

155
00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:39.125
But there is still one municipality that
strives for solidarity and compassion.

156
00:12:39.708 --> 00:12:42.250
A municipality where you can start anew.

157
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.125
-Hi!
-Hey there!

158
00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:50.000
Here. community and neighborliness
are combined with traditional values.

159
00:12:50.583 --> 00:12:51.458
Hey there!

160
00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:53.458
Well. hi there!

161
00:12:56.875 --> 00:13:00.375
If you're young with dreams of becoming
a drainage engineer.

162
00:13:00.458 --> 00:13:04.166
please apply
at our construction high school.

163
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.708
Your imagination is the only limit
to your future.

164
00:13:07.791 --> 00:13:08.625
Yeah!

165
00:13:08.708 --> 00:13:11.375
A municipality to call your home.

166
00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:14.416
your family. your life. your work.

167
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.958
or simply Kolarängen.

168
00:13:18.583 --> 00:13:20.375
Welcome home!

169
00:13:25.833 --> 00:13:30.708
"Welcome home."
A little inspiration to kick off the day.

170
00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:35.208
Was I the only one who got goosebumps?

171
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.250
I'm sorry.
but did Nordfront make that movie?

172
00:13:43.333 --> 00:13:45.625
There are white gang members there. too.

173
00:13:45.708 --> 00:13:48.916
-Is everyone in Kolarängen white?
-Not in real life.

174
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.791
But this wasn't real life.

175
00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:54.541
A bouquet of flowers
doesn't just consist of… of roses.

176
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:58.250
It's all kinds of flowers.
And all the flowers need to bloom.

177
00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:01.875
Hey. Ingela… I have to ask you something.

178
00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.875
What channel will air this crap?

179
00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.166
Torbjörn. we're not airing it
on a regular TV channel.

180
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.208
-No?
-We'll upload it to YouTube.

181
00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:12.833
How the hell can we waste resources
on these things?

182
00:14:12.916 --> 00:14:15.708
I mean. back in my day. we handed out--

183
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:18.125
Everything was better back in your day.

184
00:14:18.208 --> 00:14:21.416
You and the other men
could read porno mags in the break room

185
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.583
and eat liver pâté from the box.

186
00:14:23.666 --> 00:14:26.666
Seriously.
I think we should consider if this

187
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.166
is really how we want to sell Kolarängen.

188
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.125
No. but perhaps
we could just shorten it a bit?

189
00:14:33.375 --> 00:14:37.541
Just remove the beginning.
the middle and the end.

190
00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.583
You're so funny. you guys.
You're so incredibly funny.

191
00:14:42.666 --> 00:14:46.625
But how about you finish
one of your work tasks for once?

192
00:14:46.708 --> 00:14:49.125
Everything you do just comes to nothing.

193
00:14:49.875 --> 00:14:53.333
What about the invitations
for the ceremony tomorrow?

194
00:14:53.416 --> 00:14:57.291
You were supposed to handle it.
Did that also come to nothing?

195
00:15:05.208 --> 00:15:10.708
Now. how about we all sing
"We Shall Overcome"?

196
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.708
No. but perhaps a little break
to gather some energy?

197
00:15:18.708 --> 00:15:21.750
-There's coffee in the lobby!
-We can't accept this.

198
00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:24.000
-Coffee!
-Can you grab me a cup. Eva?

199
00:15:24.083 --> 00:15:25.083
Yes.

200
00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:31.958
That's great. Anette.

201
00:16:09.833 --> 00:16:13.291
We got. what was it.
15 million for the land.

202
00:16:13.375 --> 00:16:15.708
All the big chains will be there.

203
00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:19.583
I got Backmann-Kroon
to keep the rents down

204
00:16:19.666 --> 00:16:22.666
so local entrepreneurs
can get established in Kolarängen.

205
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.458
What large chains are coming?

206
00:16:24.541 --> 00:16:28.541
A small furniture store that makes you
put together your own shelves.

207
00:16:29.416 --> 00:16:31.500
-IKEA.
-We don't talk about that.

208
00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:33.125
-Hey!
-Hi.

209
00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:37.125
Hi. How does it feel to be back?
Did you miss us?

210
00:16:38.041 --> 00:16:39.500
I missed you. of course.

211
00:16:39.583 --> 00:16:41.541
I don't know about the rest.

212
00:16:45.541 --> 00:16:46.666
No!

213
00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:52.541
I really regret not sticking up for you
more before you went on sick leave.

214
00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:58.250
I saw how overworked you were.
so I really wanted to talk to Ingela. but…

215
00:16:58.333 --> 00:17:00.791
-It just…
-It's okay.

216
00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:03.000
She wouldn't have listened anyway.

217
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.958
Okay. guys. let's continue.

218
00:17:07.041 --> 00:17:09.625
Everyone's sharp after some caffeine.

219
00:17:11.708 --> 00:17:14.000
Now. you youngsters…

220
00:17:16.583 --> 00:17:19.500
Okay! Let's go!

221
00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:26.625
Hi. Karl here! Call or leave a message…

222
00:17:26.708 --> 00:17:30.250
Since we'll have so many new residents
in the municipality…

223
00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:33.500
-What about my bus route proposal?
-Let's deal with that later.

224
00:17:33.583 --> 00:17:35.208
Did you even present it?

225
00:17:35.291 --> 00:17:39.208
I have presented your proposal.
It's been presented. thank you.

226
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:42.625
I can't see anything
about the actual costs here.

227
00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:45.666
It sure must have cost a pretty penny.

228
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.541
I'm just saying. blueprints aren't free.

229
00:17:48.625 --> 00:17:51.250
And building the road.
and the water and sewage…

230
00:17:51.333 --> 00:17:54.541
Wait!

231
00:17:57.041 --> 00:18:01.125
Of course it costs money
to invest in the future. right?

232
00:18:06.833 --> 00:18:10.125
But the land is worth more
than what you sold it for.

233
00:18:10.208 --> 00:18:13.708
Nadja. I've gone through the numbers
multiple times. They add up.

234
00:18:13.791 --> 00:18:17.958
-Exactly. there's nothing more to discuss.
-But the mall hasn't been built yet.

235
00:18:18.041 --> 00:18:21.541
But we're breaking ground tomorrow. dear.
Tomorrow!

236
00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:23.458
In front of the entire press corps.

237
00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:28.208
-You haven't worked with us for that long.
-No. So?

238
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:31.500
So you may not be familiar
with how we do things here.

239
00:18:31.583 --> 00:18:34.041
Jonas has everything under control.

240
00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:43.500
-Nadja. can I have a peek at that?
-Sure. I'll be quiet.

241
00:18:43.583 --> 00:18:47.750
With an increase in population.
we're facing

242
00:18:47.833 --> 00:18:50.833
an interesting situation
regarding housing…

243
00:18:50.916 --> 00:18:53.791
Hold on. I don't recognize this. either.

244
00:18:53.875 --> 00:18:55.666
Oh God. I can't take any more.

245
00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:01.000
But where is the compensation agreement
for the farmer and his family. Pålsson?

246
00:19:03.416 --> 00:19:07.125
We demolished his whole farm.
They have to be compensated.

247
00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:11.791
Lina. we went through all of this
in the spring.

248
00:19:13.541 --> 00:19:14.458
We did?

249
00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:16.458
You signed the contracts.

250
00:19:16.541 --> 00:19:20.250
Sure. it's my signature.
but it's the wrong contract.

251
00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:24.500
-I wouldn't have signed this.
-So who signed it if you didn't?

252
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.916
Yet again with the speculations.

253
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.208
All these speculations.
We're supposed to be a team!

254
00:19:30.291 --> 00:19:33.583
We can't question every little thing
if we're to make progress.

255
00:19:33.666 --> 00:19:37.833
Do you remember what happened last time
we argued about petty things?

256
00:19:37.916 --> 00:19:39.208
What happened?

257
00:19:46.666 --> 00:19:47.958
Hey. Frans…

258
00:19:48.791 --> 00:19:49.625
Frasse!

259
00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:51.375
I was attacked.

260
00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:54.041
Tearing down a family farm to build a mall

261
00:19:54.125 --> 00:19:55.875
is no petty thing. is it?

262
00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.208
It's capitalist depravity.

263
00:19:58.291 --> 00:20:02.750
The shopping mall is part of
the municipality's welfare structure.

264
00:20:02.833 --> 00:20:06.916
Listen. you have to break a few eggs

265
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.125
to make a pancake.

266
00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.375
-Omelet.
-Right?

267
00:20:11.458 --> 00:20:15.541
-What do you mean?
-Pancake. I heard the word "pancake."

268
00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:16.791
Let's have lunch.

269
00:20:40.666 --> 00:20:42.375
Hot dogs?

270
00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:44.833
Is that all we get for lunch?

271
00:20:44.916 --> 00:20:48.833
Yeah. we've had some issues
with our food deliveries. Here you go.

272
00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:50.625
I thought we were having salmon.

273
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.458
Damn. this hot dog is cold. Stone cold.

274
00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:23.000
Lina?

275
00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:26.125
Lina?

276
00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:28.875
-Hi.
-God. you scared me.

277
00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:30.416
How are you?

278
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.125
Yeah. I'm… I'm fine.

279
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Can we just have a quick word?

280
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.791
-Sure.
-Cool.

281
00:21:42.541 --> 00:21:43.750
What are you doing?

282
00:21:45.333 --> 00:21:46.375
What do you mean?

283
00:21:46.458 --> 00:21:50.791
You're questioning the contracts
in front of everyone.

284
00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:53.250
Can't you see it's embarrassing for me?

285
00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:56.833
Like I did something wrong?
And Ingela gets nervous as hell.

286
00:21:56.916 --> 00:22:00.625
I just think it feels really difficult.

287
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.291
Okay. but I just told you what I saw.

288
00:22:05.375 --> 00:22:07.958
-I didn't sign those contracts. Jonas.
-No.

289
00:22:08.041 --> 00:22:10.666
-I don't recognize them at all.
-So who did?

290
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.541
Was it… the Little Ghost Godfrey. maybe?

291
00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:17.666
Or maybe you don't remember?
Is that possible?

292
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.750
It's normal for your memory to fail a bit

293
00:22:20.833 --> 00:22:23.375
when you've been stressed for a long time.

294
00:22:23.458 --> 00:22:26.250
You start to disassociate
and fabricate things…

295
00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:28.875
Think about what you say from now on.
Okay?

296
00:22:35.416 --> 00:22:36.458
Yes?

297
00:22:36.541 --> 00:22:38.958
We're out of crap paper in cabin two.

298
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:41.291
-We'll sort that out. No worries.
-Yup…

299
00:22:58.625 --> 00:23:02.375
-So. where's the chef?
-He's preparing food. or dinner.

300
00:23:02.458 --> 00:23:05.750
My main question is. really.
who has done the pricing…

301
00:23:05.833 --> 00:23:09.458
All your questions are starting to feel
like the Nuremberg Trials.

302
00:23:09.541 --> 00:23:14.000
But I have to be able to question things.
Aren't we here to discuss?

303
00:23:14.083 --> 00:23:16.750
You have to be able to discuss it
the right way.

304
00:23:16.833 --> 00:23:19.750
The last thing we want
is another Frans situation.

305
00:23:19.833 --> 00:23:21.083
Who's Frans?

306
00:23:24.375 --> 00:23:25.583
Frans? Who's Frans?

307
00:23:28.666 --> 00:23:30.208
Did I miss something?

308
00:24:52.625 --> 00:24:55.708
This is such a goddamn farce.

309
00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.166
Remember back in the day. Eva.
when municipal workers

310
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:02.375
cared about farmlands
and understood their worth?

311
00:25:02.458 --> 00:25:03.541
Do you understand?

312
00:25:07.083 --> 00:25:10.250
-Look. Anette.
-What the hell is this?

313
00:25:10.333 --> 00:25:13.916
Yeah. I think he's supposed to be
a charcoal burner.

314
00:25:14.583 --> 00:25:16.166
Howdy. gang!

315
00:25:18.291 --> 00:25:20.291
Well. I'm Sooty!

316
00:25:20.375 --> 00:25:25.000
Yes. I'm here to inaugurate
a shopping mall here in Kolarängen.

317
00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.708
We're going to have so much fun!

318
00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:33.125
Does anyone happen to have seen
a little shopping mall

319
00:25:33.208 --> 00:25:37.666
that's ready to be inaugurated?

320
00:25:39.166 --> 00:25:42.458
It's Sooty! Kolarängen's very own mascot.

321
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:43.916
What's a charcoal burner?

322
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.291
They were the proletarians of the forest
and supplied the furnaces with coal.

323
00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:51.541
The land we're now ravaging
to build malls on.

324
00:25:51.625 --> 00:25:53.291
Give me a break. Anette.

325
00:25:53.375 --> 00:25:56.583
Our municipality has the country's
most ambitious climate goals!

326
00:25:56.666 --> 00:26:00.791
Do you know the difference
between climate and environmental goals?

327
00:26:00.875 --> 00:26:03.500
-Don't bring politics into everything.
-Tell me.

328
00:26:03.583 --> 00:26:06.291
If we are going on to bring in politics…

329
00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:08.083
Someone's trying to make…

330
00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:09.625
She does have a point.

331
00:26:09.708 --> 00:26:13.166
Hey!

332
00:26:14.791 --> 00:26:17.250
What is this goddamn attitude?

333
00:26:17.916 --> 00:26:20.833
When I make an effort.
dress up and put on a show?

334
00:26:21.916 --> 00:26:23.000
Entertainment.

335
00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:27.708
I only have one thing to say:
pearls before swine.

336
00:26:37.708 --> 00:26:38.916
Are you happy now?

337
00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:02.166
There's cottage cheese pie and jam.

338
00:27:04.666 --> 00:27:07.833
Don't worry about
what the others think and feel.

339
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.041
I… I don't care.

340
00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:14.833
I feel sorry for them.

341
00:27:15.916 --> 00:27:16.958
I do.

342
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.416
They have no humor.

343
00:27:20.291 --> 00:27:23.833
What will happen to them. I wonder.
without creativity. "visionarity…"

344
00:27:23.916 --> 00:27:25.291
Jonas. listen to me.

345
00:27:25.375 --> 00:27:29.041
Those who truly mean something
know what you've accomplished.

346
00:27:30.416 --> 00:27:32.208
And that's what's important.

347
00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:36.375
People can't stand it when someone is…

348
00:27:37.166 --> 00:27:41.875
When someone is as successful
and young and visionary as you.

349
00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:45.333
They can't handle it. And you know what?

350
00:27:50.083 --> 00:27:54.875
That's why I've decided to let you get
the first crack at the shovel tomorrow.

351
00:27:55.416 --> 00:27:56.250
You.

352
00:28:25.916 --> 00:28:27.083
Try it. Jonas.

353
00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:29.041
Shovel.

354
00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:31.375
Try shoveling a bit.

355
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.958
Just like that. Great.

356
00:28:35.458 --> 00:28:37.625
That way. Like so.

357
00:28:38.416 --> 00:28:39.500
A bit stronger.

358
00:28:49.333 --> 00:28:52.666
A strong team is the foundation
of a successful organization.

359
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:56.083
so through communication and cooperation

360
00:28:56.166 --> 00:28:59.291
we will understand each other better.

361
00:29:00.875 --> 00:29:02.083
Exactly right!

362
00:29:04.708 --> 00:29:07.625
That's so fucking well said. Ingela.
Like this…

363
00:29:16.125 --> 00:29:20.041
And by communication.
I mean real communication.

364
00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:23.000
Conversations. human interaction.

365
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.583
So that means no cell phones.

366
00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:29.458
You have a lovely Christian energy.

367
00:29:30.166 --> 00:29:33.125
So we can spend some time
together with our bodies.

368
00:29:33.208 --> 00:29:35.583
Great. Put it in here.

369
00:29:36.083 --> 00:29:38.208
Good. Really great.

370
00:29:38.291 --> 00:29:42.791
We'll take that. and you can smoke
when you're back home and not here.

371
00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:45.625
That's lovely.
You'll get to listen to me for a while.

372
00:29:45.708 --> 00:29:47.666
Hey. such lovely energy!

373
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:51.666
And now I want all of you
to run back to your cabins

374
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.375
and change into durable clothes.

375
00:29:54.458 --> 00:29:56.666
because now it's team-building time!

376
00:29:58.833 --> 00:30:03.375
-I've made a quiz with topical questions.
-We won't have time for that.

377
00:30:03.458 --> 00:30:04.833
-Amir.
-Yeah?

378
00:30:06.208 --> 00:30:08.416
-You believe me. right?
-Yes. what?

379
00:30:10.291 --> 00:30:14.083
-I didn't sign those documents.
-Okay. So who did?

380
00:30:15.208 --> 00:30:16.583
I don't know. but…

381
00:30:17.458 --> 00:30:20.625
We have to compensate the farmer.
It would be mad not to.

382
00:30:20.708 --> 00:30:23.375
-How?
-We'll have to squeeze it into the budget.

383
00:30:23.458 --> 00:30:27.125
-We'll have to contact him.
-Contact who? Pålsson?

384
00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:28.125
Yeah.

385
00:30:30.125 --> 00:30:31.583
But Lina…

386
00:30:32.333 --> 00:30:33.541
Pålsson is dead.

387
00:30:33.625 --> 00:30:34.916
Didn't you know?

388
00:30:36.083 --> 00:30:37.333
What? When did he die?

389
00:30:37.416 --> 00:30:39.500
After they demolished the farm.

390
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.166
He killed himself.

391
00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:48.916
Shit.

392
00:30:50.333 --> 00:30:55.000
Ingela doesn't want us talking about it.
because of the "negative connotations."

393
00:30:56.333 --> 00:30:57.458
Of course.

394
00:30:59.791 --> 00:31:02.208
Each team will build a raft!

395
00:31:02.291 --> 00:31:06.625
At your disposal you have two pallets.

396
00:31:06.708 --> 00:31:10.875
sixty PET bottles. two rolls of duct tape.

397
00:31:10.958 --> 00:31:12.458
all your power animals

398
00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:16.750
and a large bag of fighting spirit.
Let's go!

399
00:31:21.166 --> 00:31:22.916
I'll start with the bags!

400
00:31:23.541 --> 00:31:24.958
Tape it!

401
00:31:27.916 --> 00:31:28.833
Torbjörn!

402
00:31:28.916 --> 00:31:29.958
Bottles!

403
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:33.250
-Let me tape the bottles!
-And a shitload of tape!

404
00:31:36.291 --> 00:31:39.291
-Jonas? Hello. do you hear me?
-Yes.

405
00:31:41.708 --> 00:31:43.541
Come on. red team!

406
00:31:46.041 --> 00:31:48.416
Hey. put those on the side. Tape it!

407
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.916
Come on! Screw that! Carry!

408
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.125
Come on!

409
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.833
The boys go!

410
00:32:11.916 --> 00:32:12.750
Paddle!

411
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:17.833
This is so goddamn stupid.

412
00:32:22.875 --> 00:32:24.875
-We won. Anette!
-Yeah. great.

413
00:32:24.958 --> 00:32:27.541
-To hell with this.
-We won!

414
00:32:27.625 --> 00:32:30.750
-Come on. let's have a beer.
-Brown team!

415
00:33:03.208 --> 00:33:04.125
Roger?

416
00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:06.166
Karl?

417
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.375
Cleo?

418
00:33:08.458 --> 00:33:09.416
Hello!

419
00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:13.250
Roger?

420
00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:15.125
What the…

421
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:17.666
God…

422
00:33:31.416 --> 00:33:33.708
What the fuck is this?

423
00:33:35.791 --> 00:33:36.708
Oh. God…

424
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.625
Jump!

425
00:34:01.708 --> 00:34:06.666
Jonas!

426
00:35:04.916 --> 00:35:07.708
You are on a sinking ship.

427
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.125
You have been given a list of things.

428
00:35:12.458 --> 00:35:16.958
During a limited time. you need to make
a joint decision as a team

429
00:35:17.041 --> 00:35:20.416
about which of the things on this list
you will save.

430
00:35:22.375 --> 00:35:26.000
You'll have to prioritize and compromise
under time pressure.

431
00:35:26.083 --> 00:35:27.833
which generates stress.

432
00:35:28.958 --> 00:35:32.791
Try to find a method
to deal with that stress.

433
00:35:33.416 --> 00:35:35.291
You have one minute.

434
00:35:36.375 --> 00:35:37.416
Okay.

435
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.583
Toilet paper seems very important.
That's a given.

436
00:35:40.666 --> 00:35:44.875
But cans of food. they're hard work.
so maybe we can ditch them?

437
00:35:44.958 --> 00:35:46.583
Then what will you eat?

438
00:35:47.166 --> 00:35:49.583
I can drink myself full. I'm good at that.

439
00:35:49.666 --> 00:35:51.083
Yeah. me too.

440
00:35:51.166 --> 00:35:52.416
The laptop is coming.

441
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.125
So you'll swim
with a laptop under your arm?

442
00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.375
Why's the laptop so important?

443
00:35:58.458 --> 00:36:03.041
Well. Lina. everyone's different.
but for me. it's extremely important.

444
00:36:03.125 --> 00:36:05.625
So you'd rather bring a laptop
than a life jacket?

445
00:36:06.208 --> 00:36:10.083
Yes. I know how to swim.
but I can't recover hard drives.

446
00:36:10.166 --> 00:36:12.166
Can't I recover the hard drives?

447
00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:14.916
Yes. but no… Amir!
The laptop is coming right away!

448
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.250
But Jonas.
you can pull out the hard drive.

449
00:36:17.333 --> 00:36:20.500
Let him take his laptop!
As long as I get a bottle of wine.

450
00:36:20.583 --> 00:36:23.083
But it's all about
what matters to oneself.

451
00:36:23.166 --> 00:36:25.500
If the laptop is important for Jonas…

452
00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:28.250
Seven. six. five…

453
00:36:29.458 --> 00:36:32.000
But guys!

454
00:36:32.083 --> 00:36:33.583
Guys! Quiet!

455
00:36:35.666 --> 00:36:40.083
How are we going to handle the oil spill
that happens when the boat sinks?

456
00:36:40.166 --> 00:36:42.916
You're analyzing this task wrong!

457
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.458
Ring the gong!

458
00:36:49.333 --> 00:36:52.583
THE HOLIDAY VILLAGE
WELCOMES THE SHOPPING MALL

459
00:36:58.708 --> 00:37:00.875
…Costa Rica. in the jungle.

460
00:37:01.416 --> 00:37:02.750
It was awesome as hell.

461
00:37:08.416 --> 00:37:09.333
Watch this!

462
00:37:14.625 --> 00:37:16.250
-Go. Jonas!
-You can't keep up?

463
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.291
You have awesome thighs!

464
00:37:22.291 --> 00:37:24.791
-Are you ready for the baptism of fire?
-Yes!

465
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.291
Do we have a volunteer?

466
00:37:30.291 --> 00:37:31.375
You. over there.

467
00:37:31.458 --> 00:37:32.708
Up for it?

468
00:37:33.333 --> 00:37:36.041
There won't be any stress.
It's just for fun.

469
00:37:36.125 --> 00:37:38.666
Isn't it time to rip the band-aid off?
Just do it.

470
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:43.750
We're here to challenge ourselves.
To step out into the unknown.

471
00:37:47.291 --> 00:37:53.291
Lina!

472
00:37:53.375 --> 00:37:57.666
Lina!

473
00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.916
Hey. guys.

474
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.083
You guys…

475
00:38:02.625 --> 00:38:03.750
Not like that.

476
00:38:04.833 --> 00:38:07.958
It's great that you want
to encourage Lina. really.

477
00:38:09.125 --> 00:38:12.500
But we know how fragile she is right now.

478
00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:15.875
It's no damn picnic.

479
00:38:17.041 --> 00:38:19.791
So if she's scared to…

480
00:38:21.958 --> 00:38:25.375
If she doesn't want to.
she doesn't need to.

481
00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:40.916
There is no shame in giving up.

482
00:38:41.708 --> 00:38:44.500
-Sometimes you win by giving up.
-No. I…

483
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.083
I'll go.

484
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.250
No. Kaj.

485
00:38:49.083 --> 00:38:50.625
That's not the way to go.

486
00:38:58.083 --> 00:38:59.375
Come on.

487
00:39:01.916 --> 00:39:03.708
Yeah. no… I don't want to.

488
00:39:08.208 --> 00:39:10.291
I do want to remind all of you.

489
00:39:10.375 --> 00:39:13.750
that this is the stuff
that makes you grow as a person.

490
00:39:14.625 --> 00:39:16.791
We're here to have fun. you know.

491
00:39:16.875 --> 00:39:20.208
So Cleo. I'm thinking about…

492
00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:23.583
How often are these facilities inspected?

493
00:39:25.125 --> 00:39:27.166
I've heard that these wires…

494
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.958
Back in my day. we went on conferences
to get a break from our daily routine.

495
00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:48.333
and we went on conferences
to eat good food and drink beer.

496
00:40:48.416 --> 00:40:50.500
That sounds a bit backwards. doesn't it?

497
00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:52.625
I'm hearing disagreement in the group.

498
00:40:52.708 --> 00:40:57.583
so let me say that honest disagreement
is often a sign of development.

499
00:40:57.666 --> 00:40:59.958
-Who do you think said that?
-Phil Collins.

500
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:01.208
Tony Robbins.

501
00:41:01.291 --> 00:41:03.416
Great guesses. everyone.

502
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.916
But it was in fact Mahatma Gandhi.
What did he mean by that?

503
00:41:09.375 --> 00:41:12.291
No. he meant that respectful disagreement

504
00:41:12.375 --> 00:41:13.541
between two people

505
00:41:13.625 --> 00:41:16.750
is a way to reach success
in any path of life.

506
00:41:16.833 --> 00:41:18.500
Damn well said.

507
00:41:25.708 --> 00:41:27.500
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
BACKMANN-KROON

508
00:41:30.458 --> 00:41:31.916
ABOUT THE PROCUREMENT

509
00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:36.875
A PROFITABLE DEAL FOR YOU

510
00:41:36.958 --> 00:41:39.791
THE LAND WILL BE WORTH SIGNIFICANTLY LESS

511
00:41:41.375 --> 00:41:42.833
Got you. bastard.

512
00:41:46.541 --> 00:41:48.083
Hey. guys.

513
00:41:48.166 --> 00:41:51.583
It's about damn time
we took a group photo.

514
00:41:51.666 --> 00:41:52.833
I need content.

515
00:41:58.625 --> 00:42:01.500
-Cleo. can we have our phones back?
-Yeah.

516
00:42:01.583 --> 00:42:05.708
Okay. so the taller people in the back.
and the shorter ones here.

517
00:42:05.791 --> 00:42:07.625
Let's bunch up a little.

518
00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:09.125
-Cleo?
-Yeah. no…

519
00:42:09.208 --> 00:42:13.708
Let's wait until the withdrawal
wears off completely.

520
00:42:13.791 --> 00:42:14.750
What?

521
00:42:14.833 --> 00:42:17.791
You can talk to each other instead.

522
00:42:17.875 --> 00:42:21.250
Why don't you analyze your disagreements.
and I'll…

523
00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:23.666
-Where's my head?
-What's going on?

524
00:42:26.958 --> 00:42:29.208
Bro. see you at the hot tub. hey?

525
00:42:31.166 --> 00:42:34.833
-Hey! Where the fuck is my head?
-Is that a trick question. or what?

526
00:42:34.916 --> 00:42:37.458
-It's there. between your shoulders.
-Funny.

527
00:42:37.541 --> 00:42:40.958
-I brought a huge fucking head.
-No. I haven't seen it.

528
00:42:46.875 --> 00:42:48.166
…this bullshit.

529
00:42:51.666 --> 00:42:54.541
"It's between your shoulders." Yes. it is.

530
00:42:54.625 --> 00:42:58.666
My head is between my shoulders.
Where the hell is yours? Up your ass?

531
00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.166
I should have said that.

532
00:43:03.166 --> 00:43:04.583
Whatever.

533
00:43:14.041 --> 00:43:16.291
Fuck you.

534
00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:18.666
No. it's fine.

535
00:44:14.875 --> 00:44:15.958
Wow!

536
00:44:18.458 --> 00:44:21.458
I spent two days
creating a playlist on my phone

537
00:44:21.541 --> 00:44:25.416
for this exact occasion.
It's so goddamn annoying.

538
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:29.875
They'll probably want to see
who goes mad first without their phone.

539
00:44:29.958 --> 00:44:34.125
I think it'll be Kaj. actually.
What if your 12 followers on Instagram

540
00:44:34.208 --> 00:44:38.000
can't experience
this exciting life of yours?

541
00:44:38.083 --> 00:44:39.500
Hashtag YOLO.

542
00:44:39.583 --> 00:44:43.791
-Haha. Eva. But I have 83 followers.
-Okay.

543
00:44:43.875 --> 00:44:47.416
Besides. no one even says "YOLO" anymore.
so you fail again.

544
00:44:48.416 --> 00:44:50.541
-Oh. wow…
-Oh. Ledin!

545
00:44:51.125 --> 00:44:57.083
A part of my heart
Will always beat for you

546
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.333
YOLO!

547
00:45:02.625 --> 00:45:03.458
YOLO.

548
00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:13.583
-Cheers!
-Cheers to you!

549
00:45:14.083 --> 00:45:15.416
And cheers to us. guys!

550
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:16.875
Jenny?

551
00:45:19.875 --> 00:45:20.875
Roger?

552
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:24.291
Karl?

553
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:26.875
Damn it!

554
00:45:28.791 --> 00:45:30.291
What the…

555
00:45:32.958 --> 00:45:34.083
Hello?

556
00:46:47.083 --> 00:46:49.708
Oh my God…

557
00:47:01.666 --> 00:47:03.041
Pour!

558
00:47:05.541 --> 00:47:07.416
A little flower!

559
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.958
Dear friends.
I'd like to pause to reflect on…

560
00:47:14.666 --> 00:47:18.500
…this day we've had together.

561
00:47:19.958 --> 00:47:22.208
It's been a breathtaking day.

562
00:47:22.875 --> 00:47:26.291
We've all opened up to each other
and taken off our masks.

563
00:47:26.375 --> 00:47:30.291
and together we become who we really are.

564
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:34.791
You've opened up your hearts
to each other.

565
00:47:34.875 --> 00:47:37.541
-I need the bathroom. Amir!
-Your masks…

566
00:47:38.875 --> 00:47:42.583
This new opening
gives us the chance to do wonders.

567
00:47:42.666 --> 00:47:43.500
Yes.

568
00:47:43.583 --> 00:47:46.333
Tomorrow will be
an absolutely fantastic day.

569
00:47:46.833 --> 00:47:48.833
Because now. we're all so close.

570
00:47:48.916 --> 00:47:51.208
Feel! Our skin is touching.

571
00:47:51.708 --> 00:47:53.041
Hey. Ingela?

572
00:47:54.958 --> 00:47:57.458
That scar. can you still feel it?

573
00:47:57.541 --> 00:47:59.708
I mean. physically. I don't feel it.

574
00:47:59.791 --> 00:48:03.500
But you have to understand.
mentally. being attacked like that…

575
00:48:03.583 --> 00:48:04.625
It's so hurtful.

576
00:48:04.708 --> 00:48:07.500
That a co-worker can attack you like that…

577
00:48:07.583 --> 00:48:10.000
You have to be able to feel safe at work.

578
00:48:10.083 --> 00:48:12.916
-Right now we are.
-It doesn't go away.

579
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.958
No.

580
00:48:14.708 --> 00:48:16.583
I went through Jonas' computer.

581
00:48:16.666 --> 00:48:18.875
The compensation agreements.
the land sale.

582
00:48:18.958 --> 00:48:21.958
the e-mails between Jonas.
Backmann-Kroon. and Kaj…

583
00:48:22.041 --> 00:48:24.291
-Something's off here.
-Let me see.

584
00:48:25.375 --> 00:48:29.041
All my documents are dated
a week before I went on sick leave.

585
00:48:29.125 --> 00:48:30.000
Okay?

586
00:48:30.083 --> 00:48:34.375
But the contracts they used were created
a month before they were signed.

587
00:48:34.458 --> 00:48:36.458
So they backdated the contracts?

588
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:39.916
Apparently. and forged my signature.

589
00:48:40.875 --> 00:48:41.708
No…

590
00:48:42.625 --> 00:48:43.916
-One more thing.
-What?

591
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.833
There are no contracts with any chains.
No one's interested.

592
00:48:47.916 --> 00:48:50.625
What about IKEA?
They're taking the big premises.

593
00:48:51.208 --> 00:48:56.000
No. And when the shit hits the fan.
Jonas will be working for Backmann-Kroon.

594
00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.791
There's a contract.

595
00:48:59.833 --> 00:49:01.000
It's all here.

596
00:49:04.625 --> 00:49:07.333
No. dammit.
my stomach is starting to rumble.

597
00:49:07.416 --> 00:49:10.583
-Do you know what time it is. Eva?
-The time is…

598
00:49:13.958 --> 00:49:16.208
-It's 7 p.m.
-It's 7 already?

599
00:49:16.291 --> 00:49:18.458
Christ. they're an hour late.

600
00:49:18.541 --> 00:49:21.958
Why can't they stick to the schedule
at this goddamn place?

601
00:49:22.041 --> 00:49:24.416
It's freezing.
Do you want to come to my cabin?

602
00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.541
Well. do you have anything to eat?

603
00:49:26.625 --> 00:49:27.791
Potato chips. red wine.

604
00:49:28.958 --> 00:49:30.125
Deal.

605
00:49:37.125 --> 00:49:39.708
-The Wolf of Wall Street.
-What a great film.

606
00:49:40.375 --> 00:49:41.500
You need an ISK.

607
00:49:41.583 --> 00:49:44.333
ISK? Isk? Isk's the thing.

608
00:49:44.416 --> 00:49:48.750
But if you really mean business.
you'll go with a crypto wallet.

609
00:49:49.458 --> 00:49:50.291
Damn.

610
00:49:50.375 --> 00:49:52.708
Did you get Kaj to forge my signature?

611
00:49:52.791 --> 00:49:54.125
You're good at that.

612
00:49:54.208 --> 00:49:56.208
Letting others do your dirty work.

613
00:49:56.291 --> 00:49:57.625
Whoa.

614
00:49:58.458 --> 00:50:01.291
Hold your horses.
What are you talking about?

615
00:50:01.375 --> 00:50:03.166
Yeah. what are you talking about?

616
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.833
Did Backmann-Kroon offer you a job. too?

617
00:50:06.375 --> 00:50:08.875
A pay raise and conference trips to Dubai?

618
00:50:09.416 --> 00:50:11.541
That's not official. is it?

619
00:50:12.666 --> 00:50:14.333
You know… Lina. damn it…

620
00:50:14.416 --> 00:50:15.833
I know what you've done.

621
00:50:17.875 --> 00:50:19.083
IKEA's not coming.

622
00:50:20.375 --> 00:50:21.583
No one's coming.

623
00:50:35.666 --> 00:50:37.666
Can you and I talk in private?

624
00:50:46.375 --> 00:50:50.333
-Bro. you want me to tag along?
-No. hell no. I've got this.

625
00:50:50.416 --> 00:50:53.291
You just sit there and enjoy. Enjoy!

626
00:51:00.958 --> 00:51:03.583
Now I see why you gave me
all that extra work.

627
00:51:04.333 --> 00:51:08.500
You had Ingela give me a lot
of unnecessary tasks to distract me.

628
00:51:08.583 --> 00:51:10.708
And then you used my sick leave

629
00:51:10.791 --> 00:51:13.208
to make everyone believe
that I was in the wrong.

630
00:51:13.291 --> 00:51:14.333
Lina…

631
00:51:16.375 --> 00:51:17.666
Look at me.

632
00:51:19.458 --> 00:51:20.416
I like you.

633
00:51:22.125 --> 00:51:24.708
Because you're smart. Up here.

634
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
But I'm wondering.
what are you really doing here?

635
00:51:30.083 --> 00:51:32.416
You shouldn't be here.
you should be there.

636
00:51:33.708 --> 00:51:37.625
You belong
on a much larger playing field. Lina.

637
00:51:41.791 --> 00:51:44.458
This just hit me.
and it has to stay between us…

638
00:51:46.291 --> 00:51:49.291
but I happen to know
that Backmann-Kroon are hiring.

639
00:51:52.708 --> 00:51:56.666
In my position.
I could get you a sweet job over there.

640
00:51:58.541 --> 00:51:59.958
With a great salary.

641
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.500
One where you'd actually be happy.

642
00:52:06.625 --> 00:52:10.750
And we'll forget this bullshit.
What do you think?

643
00:52:21.583 --> 00:52:22.416
No…

644
00:52:23.958 --> 00:52:25.166
Screw that. then.

645
00:52:29.666 --> 00:52:32.458
Why are you saying that IKEA's not coming?

646
00:52:33.791 --> 00:52:35.791
-Well. are they?
-Yes. they are.

647
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:39.750
But they'll come in their own time.

648
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.333
And I don't need someone who…
walks around like this.

649
00:52:44.416 --> 00:52:48.041
We're here because of me!
Did you forget that? It's mine!

650
00:52:48.125 --> 00:52:51.375
I'm under so much pressure.
I'm digging tomorrow. with the shovel!

651
00:52:51.458 --> 00:52:52.416
Do you get that?

652
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.333
I'll stand in front of the press and dig!

653
00:52:58.083 --> 00:53:00.250
There'll be no revenue. No tourists.

654
00:53:00.333 --> 00:53:02.416
The mall will be a fiasco.

655
00:53:03.375 --> 00:53:05.416
The municipality will go bankrupt.

656
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:11.416
Where the hell are you getting this from?

657
00:53:14.625 --> 00:53:16.625
Your extremely valuable laptop.

658
00:53:28.708 --> 00:53:33.500
You're way out of your depth now. Lina.
You know that. right?

659
00:53:36.041 --> 00:53:38.750
Either you come clean
and stop the construction

660
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:42.416
or I'm taking this to the police.

661
00:53:56.708 --> 00:53:58.416
Damn. I love this song.

662
00:53:59.083 --> 00:54:00.791
Anette. turn up the volume.

663
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.833
-Anette?
-What?

664
00:54:03.916 --> 00:54:06.875
Turn up the volume!
This song means a lot to me.

665
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:13.583
What kind of shitty song is this?

666
00:55:22.208 --> 00:55:24.250
No. it's getting late.

667
00:55:30.458 --> 00:55:32.291
And here comes that one.

668
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:39.625
Hey. Sooty! Bro!

669
00:55:41.833 --> 00:55:43.041
Hey. Sooty. my man!

670
00:55:44.375 --> 00:55:47.750
It's cool. I'm just paranoid
about this Lina stuff and…

671
00:55:47.833 --> 00:55:49.791
What are you doing with that? What?

672
00:56:40.333 --> 00:56:42.541
Hello! Jenny?

673
00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:46.208
We're starting to get hungry here. Hello?

674
00:57:19.708 --> 00:57:24.166
Dear God…
True and righteous are Your Judgments.

675
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:33.208
Jonas!

676
00:58:04.833 --> 00:58:08.208
Are you seeing this?
He's fucking hanging her up!

677
00:58:08.291 --> 00:58:09.458
Who's that?

678
00:58:10.375 --> 00:58:11.625
Sooty? What?

679
00:58:13.958 --> 00:58:16.250
Run. Lina!

680
00:58:16.833 --> 00:58:19.208
Run!

681
00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:42.250
Get up!

682
00:58:45.125 --> 00:58:47.166
What the fuck is going on?

683
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:49.208
The police. Call the police!

684
00:58:54.166 --> 00:58:56.083
Hello? It's fucking dead!

685
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:59.500
What should we do?

686
00:59:00.208 --> 00:59:01.875
The raft. Come on. the raft!

687
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:05.083
Ow!

688
00:59:07.416 --> 00:59:08.375
Lift!

689
00:59:10.666 --> 00:59:12.791
Dammit! I'll go first!

690
00:59:16.791 --> 00:59:18.583
-Oh my God…
-Damn it!

691
00:59:18.666 --> 00:59:20.625
There's blood everywhere.

692
00:59:22.041 --> 00:59:25.666
Eva! Let's calm down. Eva.
Everything will be just fine…

693
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:27.500
Let go of me!

694
00:59:50.375 --> 00:59:51.708
Fuck…

695
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.875
What sick bastard has done this?

696
01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:11.875
It's that goddamn Frans
from the environmental office.

697
01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:34.750
What are you doing?

698
01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:36.333
Keep paddling!

699
01:00:38.208 --> 01:00:39.208
The flash drive.

700
01:00:40.541 --> 01:00:42.333
-What?
-Give it to me.

701
01:00:43.541 --> 01:00:48.125
And we'll go ashore. call the police
and forget our old grudges. okay?

702
01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:53.083
Give it to me.

703
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.125
Give it to me!

704
01:01:02.666 --> 01:01:04.291
You're out of your mind.

705
01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:21.625
If only you'd listened to me. Lina!

706
01:01:22.125 --> 01:01:24.833
What a fucking team
we could have been. huh?

707
01:01:24.916 --> 01:01:29.625
Such a fucking good
little fucking girl. aren't you?

708
01:01:29.708 --> 01:01:32.083
Why the fuck is everyone against me?

709
01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.458
Let's see.

710
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:36.791
Let's inhale through our nose
and exhale through our mouth.

711
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:40.833
We're on a sinking ship.

712
01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:44.791
What do you need to survive
on a sinking ship?

713
01:02:44.875 --> 01:02:46.416
What things do you need?

714
01:02:51.625 --> 01:02:52.833
Okay.

715
01:02:57.833 --> 01:02:59.291
I think you need to…

716
01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:01.333
-For fuck's sake. Amir!
-You have to…

717
01:03:01.416 --> 01:03:04.333
Quit nagging me. goddamn it!
I know these things.

718
01:03:04.416 --> 01:03:06.250
-Yes.
-There.

719
01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:10.041
Do you see anything?

720
01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:11.666
No.

721
01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:15.416
Hey. listen up.

722
01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:18.375
We need to come up
with a damn good strategy.

723
01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:20.333
-The minivan.
-What about it?

724
01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:21.583
-The minivan.
-Yes?

725
01:03:21.666 --> 01:03:24.875
-Jonas has the keys…
-You can't go to the minivan. please!

726
01:03:24.958 --> 01:03:29.041
I'm not leaving this house.
I'm not taking a step from here.

727
01:03:29.125 --> 01:03:31.291
How can it be so damn hard to understand?

728
01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:34.375
-Are you choosing Jonas' cabin or death?
-I'm staying here!

729
01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:36.666
-Torbjörn?
-Yeah. No.

730
01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:38.375
You're unbelievable.

731
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.583
-Nadja!
-Nadja!

732
01:03:41.666 --> 01:03:42.541
Hush!

733
01:03:43.083 --> 01:03:45.458
-And Amir. where the hell is Amir?
-Huh?

734
01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:46.416
What the hell?

735
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:50.583
Lina?

736
01:04:08.125 --> 01:04:09.041
Lina!

737
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:17.083
Lina!

738
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:25.958
Ouch! Damn it!

739
01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.208
Lina?

740
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.708
Turn off the light.

741
01:05:52.625 --> 01:05:54.666
-Did you see him?
-Is he out there?

742
01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:02.125
-No!
-No…

743
01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:04.500
No!

744
01:06:07.125 --> 01:06:08.291
Fuck! No.

745
01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:14.333
Fuck…

746
01:06:26.125 --> 01:06:27.208
No…

747
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.875
No! Someone's here.

748
01:07:02.666 --> 01:07:04.208
Calm down! It's us!

749
01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:03.291
This is insane.

750
01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:05.833
Listen… Listen. all of you.

751
01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:09.083
From now on. we stick together.
We all stick together. okay?

752
01:08:09.958 --> 01:08:11.208
Oh dear God…

753
01:08:13.916 --> 01:08:14.958
What is it?

754
01:08:16.541 --> 01:08:17.791
Anette…

755
01:08:54.666 --> 01:08:56.666
Who was that with the mask and…

756
01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:02.583
Little Kaj!

757
01:09:05.458 --> 01:09:09.333
Did you see what happened to Kaj?

758
01:09:09.416 --> 01:09:12.041
He just laid there like…

759
01:09:12.125 --> 01:09:15.416
Kaj… There was so much… It was horrible.

760
01:09:18.708 --> 01:09:20.458
We need to get it in place!

761
01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:25.458
No. wait. Let me do that.

762
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.708
I'll do it.

763
01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:35.000
There. there. Yuck.

764
01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:36.875
Yuck. that's gross.

765
01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:42.666
-Are you ready?
-Yeah…

766
01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:44.250
This will sting a little…

767
01:09:48.041 --> 01:09:50.791
Mother… fucking… bitch!

768
01:09:50.875 --> 01:09:52.791
Quiet. or I won't stitch you up.

769
01:09:55.166 --> 01:09:56.416
Fucking…

770
01:09:57.375 --> 01:10:00.125
-Time for another one. Are you ready?
-Yes!

771
01:10:01.291 --> 01:10:03.333
Like that…

772
01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:12.333
-There we go. I'll pull a little now.
-Yes!

773
01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:14.916
There.

774
01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:22.291
Fuck…

775
01:10:22.791 --> 01:10:25.500
I look terrible. Fuck.

776
01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.000
Oh. my…

777
01:10:33.083 --> 01:10:36.291
Who's this fucking psycho?
Who would do this?

778
01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:39.250
Maybe it was…

779
01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:42.416
Maybe it was my fault.

780
01:10:43.166 --> 01:10:44.833
-What?
-Maybe.

781
01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:50.666
-What are you talking about?
-I mean. I…

782
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:53.875
-What are you talking about?
-Yeah. I…

783
01:10:54.791 --> 01:10:58.583
I told him we were going here
for our conference.

784
01:10:58.666 --> 01:11:01.291
-Who? Told who?
-I told him…

785
01:11:01.375 --> 01:11:03.208
I told Frans.

786
01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:06.625
-Frans?
-Yes.

787
01:11:07.375 --> 01:11:10.583
Why the fuck are you talking to Frans?

788
01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.000
We are friends.

789
01:11:12.708 --> 01:11:14.041
-Friends?
-Yes.

790
01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:18.375
-Oh. my…
-Right. that explains everything.

791
01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:22.166
-What?
-You're unharmed. Aren't you?

792
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.666
-Yes… I'm sorry.
-Everyone is against me. damn it.

793
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.625
Everyone's so fucking stupid.
I need to get away.

794
01:11:30.708 --> 01:11:34.375
Wait for me! I need to come with you!

795
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:41.833
Wait for me. Jonas. Wait for me!

796
01:11:44.625 --> 01:11:46.583
Wait for me. Jonas.

797
01:11:47.125 --> 01:11:48.541
Wait for me!

798
01:11:52.958 --> 01:11:56.958
Push. now! Push. he's coming!

799
01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.291
Push. for fuck's sake!

800
01:11:59.375 --> 01:12:02.083
He's coming! Push. make yourself useful!

801
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.958
Stop!

802
01:12:06.041 --> 01:12:08.583
-Ow. Jonas! No!
-Let go!

803
01:12:10.166 --> 01:12:12.458
Wait for me! Jonas!

804
01:12:22.708 --> 01:12:24.875
I know why you're doing this. Frans.

805
01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:30.416
But please. listen. That's enough.

806
01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:31.791
I…

807
01:12:34.875 --> 01:12:36.583
I'm on your team.

808
01:12:39.333 --> 01:12:42.708
I've really tried to make them understand

809
01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:47.541
how this shopping mall
will impact the environment

810
01:12:47.625 --> 01:12:49.541
and the citizens and…

811
01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:52.750
But no one listens to me.

812
01:12:53.416 --> 01:12:56.000
I can see why you're angry. I'm angry too.

813
01:13:01.666 --> 01:13:05.875
Don't you want me to help you
take this silly head off? Huh?

814
01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:12.833
It must be really heavy
and difficult to breathe and…

815
01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:24.666
You're not Frans. Who are you?

816
01:13:46.583 --> 01:13:51.333
We shall overcome…

817
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.916
We don't have any vehicles to get us out.

818
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.333
we can't call anyone

819
01:14:18.416 --> 01:14:21.083
and there's a killer
waiting for us out there.

820
01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:23.333
If we're lucky. He might be in here.

821
01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:25.833
We should stay here until help arrives.

822
01:14:25.916 --> 01:14:27.625
He might kill us before that.

823
01:14:27.708 --> 01:14:32.958
That chef has to come back some time.
How delayed can a dinner really get. huh?

824
01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:33.958
The zipline.

825
01:14:35.125 --> 01:14:37.458
It would take us right across the lake.

826
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:43.375
We'll go there together. guys. Come on.

827
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:45.666
Come on. Eva.

828
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:56.458
"WE WON'T GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT"

829
01:14:56.541 --> 01:14:59.333
Amir. come on now.
What's going on? Let's go.

830
01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:01.583
I don't think it's Frans doing this.

831
01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:04.083
What's that?

832
01:15:06.833 --> 01:15:09.083
Oh. shit… It's Pålsson's boy.

833
01:15:20.666 --> 01:15:23.708
He was the one
who found his dad in the stable.

834
01:15:25.083 --> 01:15:25.916
Damn…

835
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.291
-Let's go. Amir.
-Come on.

836
01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:33.166
-Let's do this. damn it.
-Is there gasoline in this?

837
01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:46.041
Can anyone see anything?

838
01:16:14.625 --> 01:16:15.458
Be quiet!

839
01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:23.958
There he is!

840
01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:28.250
Back up!

841
01:16:29.083 --> 01:16:31.083
Run!

842
01:16:31.666 --> 01:16:32.583
Eva!

843
01:16:32.666 --> 01:16:33.791
No. come back!

844
01:16:33.875 --> 01:16:35.125
Run. Eva!

845
01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:37.291
Wait. Eva!

846
01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:39.750
Run!

847
01:16:40.958 --> 01:16:43.000
-Run. Lina!
-Keep on running!

848
01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:44.666
No! Here!

849
01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:59.041
Here.

850
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:02.083
There.

851
01:18:14.416 --> 01:18:16.291
Come on.

852
01:18:17.583 --> 01:18:19.958
What the hell… Eva?

853
01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:33.125
What the hell…

854
01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:34.583
Eva?

855
01:18:35.458 --> 01:18:36.833
Eva. what the hell?

856
01:18:44.583 --> 01:18:48.791
…then I'll call Mom
and hope she's in a good mood…

857
01:18:48.875 --> 01:18:51.875
Eva? What the hell?

858
01:18:51.958 --> 01:18:54.125
What are you doing. Eva?

859
01:18:54.208 --> 01:18:58.083
You can't be here.
Surely you understand that. Eva? Come on.

860
01:18:58.833 --> 01:19:00.791
Don't touch me!

861
01:19:02.416 --> 01:19:04.333
One more step. Lina. Come on!

862
01:19:07.166 --> 01:19:10.708
Come on. One more step. You can do this.

863
01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:13.416
What the hell?

864
01:21:15.375 --> 01:21:16.625
What the…

865
01:21:18.375 --> 01:21:21.125
Perhaps it's Anette. Torbjörn. be careful.

866
01:21:21.791 --> 01:21:22.666
Anette?

867
01:21:24.291 --> 01:21:25.416
Anette?

868
01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:27.041
Is it the police?

869
01:21:27.125 --> 01:21:29.041
Maybe it's the police. Torbjörn.

870
01:21:30.208 --> 01:21:31.791
Be careful. Torbjörn.

871
01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:37.000
-Anette?
-Is it Anette?

872
01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:39.333
Anette. is…

873
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.166
Run. Eva. damn it. Run!

874
01:21:57.916 --> 01:21:59.916
You perverted son of a bitch!

875
01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:03.000
Oh. come on.

876
01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:07.250
Come on!
