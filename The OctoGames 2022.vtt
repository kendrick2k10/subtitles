3
00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:25.441
I was watching videos on the

4
00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.778
internet the other night.
I like to stay educated. you know?

5
00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.947
And I saw this one about octopuses.

6
00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:36.035
Turns out
they have mini brains in each of their

7
00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:39.706
eight legs. allowing them to act
independently of one another.

8
00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:43.793
And that gave me an idea.

9
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.630
The OctoGames.

10
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.926
eight games. eight players. one winner.

11
00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:54.721
each player acts independently.

12
00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.016
but are all part of the same game.

13
00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.728
My game. my totally sick.

14
00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:03.187
Totally epic.

15
00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.231
Totally awesome game.

16
00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.944
How sick is that. bro?

17
00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.447
Oh. that's harsh

18
00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:14.783
Can you turn that down.

19
00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:22.582
Name?

20
00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:24.959

Okay. sign here.

22
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:32.675
What's a place this big doing
in the middle of nowhere?

23
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.636
It's JaxPro's studio.

24
00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.639
Wow. okay!

25
00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.977

Oh. uh...

27
00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:46.773
We'll return them to you
at the end of the games.

28
00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:49.067
OK. Yeah. I get that

29
00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:51.861
this way.

30
00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:52.611
Alright.

31
00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:53.571
Thanks.

32
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.088
Have y'all seen JaxPro yet?

33
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:15.635
Don't bother. he barely talked to me.

34
00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:17.637
I'm focused.

35
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.013
That prize is mine.

36
00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:21.723
We don't even know what it is yet.

37
00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:24.811
JaxPro is running this.
so it's going to be huge.

38
00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:28.355

39
00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:30.524

It's nice to meet you.

41
00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.069
Nice to meet you.

42
00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:34.403
Oh my gosh.

43
00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:36.990
Aren't you so excited?
We get to be in the new JaxPro video.

44
00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.117
I'm just here to get more followers.

45
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.078
Okay.

46
00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:43.662
What do you think?

47
00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:44.913
Oh. I'm going to win this.

48
00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:45.664
Is that so?

49
00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.333
Yeah. How hard can it be?

50
00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.545
Walt Brentwood. Entrepreneur.

51
00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:52.297
Carrie.

52
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.508
You look like you'd be great

53
00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.677
at selling real estate.

54
00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:00.471
What?

55
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.486
Hey. Moneybags.

56
00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:17.822
Switch with me.

57
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:20.825
Who. me?

58
00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:28.999
What's up. guys?

59
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.087
My name is JaxPro. and welcome
to game one of the OctoGames.

60
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.344
I hope you all found everything OK.

61
00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:44.057
You have each been invited here due
to your promising social media presence.

62
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.187
This is the first of eight games
and only eight of you will move forward.

63
00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.607
Now you've probably seen
the room is full of cameras.

64
00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.650
Once the games are over.

65
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:58.529
everything will be uploaded to my channel
for the world to see.

66
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.948
What's the prize?

67
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.158
Well. I was going to wait
until after the first game

68
00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.368
to say but.

69
00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:05.620
Oh. come on!

70
00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:06.955
Boo! Come on!

71
00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.207
All right.

72
00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:13.211
After the games.
I'll be retiring from social media.

73
00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:15.837
Wait. what? You can't!

74
00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:16.964
Whoa whoa! It's OK.

75
00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:21.969
It's all right because the winner
is going to win all of my social media

76
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.349
accounts. my sponsorships
and my one hundred and fifteen

77
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.476
million followers.

78
00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:34.106
So let's not waste any time.

79
00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:38.611
The first game is. Simon Says.

80
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.738
Simon Says like the kids game?

81
00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.032
The game is simple.

82
00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:47.078
All players must obey
any command. beginning with the words.

83
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:51.748
"Simon Says". If I say.
"Simon Says take a step"

84
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:53.501
then all players must take a step.

85
00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:57.421
But if I say "jump" without saying.
"Simon Says" first

86
00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.465
the players must not jump.

87
00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:05.221
If you do a command without "Simon Says"
in front of it. you'll be eliminated.

88
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.058
The last eight
standing will move on to Game two.

89
00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:10.518
Good luck.

90
00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.731
This is the Eliminator.

91
00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.608
He will escort the losers out.

92
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.781
You've gotta be kidding me!

93
00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:27.952
What is he.
like a dog or something?

94
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.926
Simon says.

95
00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.471
Clap once.

96
00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:52.685
Simon says.

97
00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:54.479
Touch your nose.

98
00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.865
Simon says. put your hand down.

99
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.453
Put your hand on your head.

100
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.042
Simon didn't say to put
your hand on your head.

101
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.504
Sadly. you are eliminated.

102
00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.156
No! No!

103
00:06:49.992 --> 00:06:50.743
Oh my god...

104
00:06:55.456 --> 00:06:57.124
Stay calm.

105
00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.627
Anyone
attempting to leave will be eliminated.

106
00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.386
What's up. guys?

107
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.555
I thought I made the rules clear.

108
00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.558
You never said you were going to kill us.

109
00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.981
Yeah. Simon didn't say speak.

110
00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:23.108
Only twelve players remain.

111
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.235
Good luck.

112
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.114
Simon says.

113
00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:31.159
Stand on one foot.

114
00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.180
Carrie.

115
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.431
What?

116
00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:56.809
He's leaning against the wall.

117
00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.353
He's cheating.

118
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.422
Simon says.

119
00:08:28.132 --> 00:08:30.384
Hold your breath.

120
00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:55.785
Oh. Jesus.

121
00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:17.264
Hey!

122
00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:28.484
Simon says the game is over.

123
00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:30.151
Congratulations.

124
00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:32.613
The eight of you were able to complete
Game one.

125
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.700
You've qualified for the chance
to win my accounts.

126
00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:39.245
And my one hundred and
fifteen million followers.

127
00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:43.291
Approach the camera
and state your name and occupation.

128
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:47.044

Luna. honey?

152
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:23.139
Are you tanning?

153
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.349
It's freezing!

154

155
00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:27.436
Oh my god...

Well. I have the footage from Simon says.

157
00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:35.235
I cannot wait to see it all cut together.

158
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:39.615
Gosh. honey. I am so excited to retire
and run away with you.

159
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.367
I can't wait to get fat.

160
00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:46.080
Oh. we're going to get so fucking fat
with no one around to judge us.

161
00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.081
You'll finally. let yourself go bald

162
00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:50.208
and you'll stop tanning
and the cold.

163
00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.669
We'll be hideous.

164
00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.587
Oh. you're so out of my league.

165
00:11:54.588 --> 00:11:56.340
Not for long.

166
00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:00.511
But like. how fat?

167
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.240
Clothes.

168
00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:29.790
This is so surreal.

169
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.501
I'm still in shock.

170
00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:35.963
You and everyone else.

171
00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:39.550
I gotta call. my sister. I gotta...

Hey. You okay?

173
00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:49.559
I'm scared.

174
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.352
Yeah. us too.

175
00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:54.565
I'm just a preschool
teacher. I'm not going to make it far.

176
00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:59.612
Hey. the
three of us. we'll stick together.

177
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.613
Alright?

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:03.490
Oh. please.

179
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.241
Are you serious?

180
00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:06.993
This surprises you?

181
00:13:06.994 --> 00:13:09.078
This is the big time. honey.

182
00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:12.583
Famous people drink the blood of babies
to stay young all the time.

183
00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:16.378
You really thought winning a hundred
million followers would be easy?

184
00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.090
Good luck. sweetheart.

185
00:13:22.259 --> 00:13:24.553
Hey. Take a deep breath.

186
00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.137
Think about it. we're dead!

187
00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.514
Just breathe! Hey!

188
00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.265
In.

189
00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:30.184
Out.

190
00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:35.439
You're right.

191
00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:37.191
I've got this.

192
00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:41.195
I'm motivated. I'm driven. I'm fit.

193
00:13:41.862 --> 00:13:42.695
I can do this.

194
00:13:42.696 --> 00:13:43.488
We can do this.

195
00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:45.574
We're going to be all right. OK?

196
00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:55.125
What a bunch of stinkers am I right?

197
00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:57.253
Stinkers?

198
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.379
Yeah.

199
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.589
You and me.

200
00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:02.466
We're smart.

201
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.468
We know stuff.

202
00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.304
Everybody else is just ruled
by their emotions.

203
00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:13.853
Yeah. I'm not looking to make friends.

204
00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:15.396
You sure?

205
00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:19.065
I can start charming these ladies.

206
00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:20.109
Get us an advantage.

207
00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.947
Yeah? Think so?

208
00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:28.659
Dude. I could charm the
panties off Mother Teresa.

209
00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.708
Yeah. I'm not looking to make friends.

210
00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:39.545
But I could use an ally.

211
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:42.131
Maxine.

212
00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:43.424
Look.

213
00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:48.721
Here we go.

214
00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.650
Where are we?

215
00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:04.778
Lights on!

216
00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:12.828
Whoa!

217
00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:15.496
What's up. guys?

218
00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:18.082
Game number two is hopscotch.

219
00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:20.335
The rules are simple.

220
00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:22.420
First. you'll draw a number.

221
00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:25.007
That number will represent the order
you'll go.

222
00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:31.513
Each player must hop across to win. but
if the board turns red. you can't move.

223
00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:36.185
If you do move when the board is red.
you will be eliminated.

224
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.355
The game ends after the first elimination.

225
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.440
Good luck.

226
00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:43.901
First contestant!

227
00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:46.737
Okay...

228
00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:14.390
How are you feeling?

229
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:16.308
Good.

230
00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:19.561
Like I said. I'm a preschool teacher.

231
00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:23.107
hopscotch is my specialty.

232
00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:25.609
What were you whistling?

233
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.861
You'll see.

234
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:31.031
Next contestant.

235
00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:40.290
OK. All right.

236
00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:41.250
Here we go.

237
00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.021
That. What is that?

238
00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.648
Shh!

239
00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.077
Almost there.

240
00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:19.329
Almost there. Almost there. Almost there.

241
00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:22.124
You think she'll make it?

242
00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:24.209
Quiet!

243
00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:36.763
Trade with me.

244
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.098
What? Why? You have the best number.

245
00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:40.224
I feel good about this.

246
00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:42.478
I'm trying to do you a favor.

247
00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:44.395
OK. Sure.

248
00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:45.397
Thanks.

249
00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:50.110
Next contestant.

250
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.021
Yes!

251
00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:29.650
Yes! Send the flowers.
she's done! She's done!

252
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.236
She's done! Oh. yes!

253
00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:36.698
No. no. no. no. no!

254
00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:40.077
No! Stop!

255
00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.329
Please! Stop!

256
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.374
No no no no!

257
00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:48.210
No! Stop! Please!

258
00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:51.964
Please. stop! Stop!

259
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.138
Stop it. you're torturing her!

260
00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:29.458
That wasn't smart.

261
00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:32.753
I couldn't just let him torture her.

262
00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:34.464
You could have been killed.

263
00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:36.842
Hey.

264
00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:39.635
You were really brave back there.

265
00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:40.595
The hell do you want?

266
00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:41.138
Wait.

267
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:43.640
Let him talk.

268
00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:45.976
Why'd you switch numbers with me?

269
00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:51.106
I told Squish

270
00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.566
I was on his side.

271
00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:55.860
I told him I'd get in with you
for his benefit.

272
00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:57.403
So are you on our side?

273
00:19:57.404 --> 00:19:59.990
I'm on whose
ever side helps me to take him down.

274
00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:01.157
How can we trust you?

275
00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:01.825
You can't.

276
00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.787
So what do you say?

277
00:20:06.955 --> 00:20:07.706
You in?

278
00:20:13.086 --> 00:20:15.630
You look like you could use a friend.

279
00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:16.339
Do I?

280
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.341
Sure.

281
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.969
You're a strong young man
and that helps me in the games

282
00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:25.474
and I'm a woman and I might be able
to help you in a different way.

283
00:20:26.683 --> 00:20:27.643
Really?

284
00:20:27.684 --> 00:20:28.518
Yeah.

285
00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:30.437
No.

286
00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.111
Hey. handsome.

287
00:20:39.112 --> 00:20:41.365
I have a question.

288
00:20:43.158 --> 00:20:45.076
Hey. I'm talking to you.

289
00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.371
Go away.

290
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.997
I'm meditating.

291
00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:51.667
Leave me alone.

292
00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.628
You know. I've seen your videos before.

293
00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:58.882
all that motivational stuff
you did after you got out of prison.

294
00:20:59.466 --> 00:21:01.884
It's empowering.

295
00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:02.802
Where are you going?

296
00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:03.844
Anywhere else.

297
00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:04.595
Hold on.

298
00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.472
I want to tell you about my cooking show.

299
00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:08.976
Why? Only one of us
are going to make it out of here anyway.

300
00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:13.396
I have a cooking show and I have great
ideas for cookware and kitchen items.

301
00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:15.439
If you don't leave me the fuck alone

302
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.275
I swear I will beat the shit out of you.

303
00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.528
You can't do that. I'm a woman.

304
00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:21.904
It's never stopped me before.

305
00:21:21.905 --> 00:21:24.908
You really need to learn
to control your emotions.

306
00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:35.167
Hey. are you OK?

307
00:21:35.168 --> 00:21:36.211
(Mumbling)

308
00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:38.797
I'm warning everybody right now

309
00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:42.384
do not fuck with me!

310
00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:51.726
Fucking jackass.

311
00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:52.727
I could have taken him.

312
00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:54.520
I just didn't see it coming.

313
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:56.023
How? He warned you?

314
00:21:56.356 --> 00:21:57.316
Tilt your head back a bit.

315
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:01.610
You seem to really know what you're doing.

316
00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:03.946
I was in med school before I was a gamer.

317
00:22:03.947 --> 00:22:06.533
Talk about a real downgrade. huh?

318
00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:12.163
I'm AJ. by the way.

319
00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:13.247
I don't think we formally met

320
00:22:13.248 --> 00:22:14.040
Maxine

321
00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:15.208
Carrie

322
00:22:16.251 --> 00:22:17.836
Sorry about your friend.

323
00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:19.879
This is ridiculous.

324
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.841
We need to find a way out of here.

325
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.219
Everyone. please prepare yourself for Game
three

326
00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:28.305
Already?

327
00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:29.889
Tonight.

328
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.682
Let's look for a way out.

329
00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:32.517
Deal.

330
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.899
Hey. baby.

331
00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:39.649
What's up?

332
00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:42.069
Any missing persons reports yet?

333
00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:45.780
No. I have been texting the families.
so no suspects anything.

334
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:47.240
Oh. good. Good.

335
00:22:48.158 --> 00:22:50.243
You know. I really
think this is going to be my masterpiece.

336
00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:53.080
the perfect way to go out.

337
00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:59.044
How long. do you think.
until people realize it's real?

338
00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:01.045
Don't know. don't care.

339
00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:04.049
As long as we're on an island somewhere
when it all happens.

340
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.218
Two more days...

341
00:23:06.802 --> 00:23:07.511
Two...

342
00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:09.721
No. three more days.

343
00:23:11.098 --> 00:23:13.015
Oh. duh.

344
00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:14.434
Three more days. Right.

345
00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:17.604
Good work.

346
00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:33.619
What's up. guys?

347
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.831
You can take your blindfolds off.

348
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.795
Welcome to the obstacle course.

349
00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:45.924
This game. however. is optional.

350
00:23:46.842 --> 00:23:49.511
You guys have tugged at my heartstrings.

351
00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:53.222
so I wanted to give you a way out.

352
00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:55.891
The rules are simple make it to

353
00:23:55.892 --> 00:23:59.438
the end in under sixty seconds
and you get to go home.

354
00:24:00.063 --> 00:24:02.314
No questions asked.

355
00:24:02.315 --> 00:24:04.567
Any volunteers?

356
00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:05.652
I'll do it.

357
00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:09.738
Bitch. I'm not going.

358
00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:11.615
Why not? You've had the shit
beaten out of you

359
00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:13.701
If you think a little bruise
is going to keep me

360
00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:16.955
from winning a hundred million followers.
you've got another thing coming.

361
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:17.873
Whatever.

362
00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:32.386
This is too easy.

363
00:24:32.387 --> 00:24:33.889
What's the catch?

364
00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:41.146
Your time starts now.

365
00:24:56.703 --> 00:24:58.413
There's the catch.

366
00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:24.147
You gonna do it?

367
00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:26.690
What? Are you kidding? No way.

368
00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:28.652
We got a game to win.

369
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.142
I did it!

370
00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:02.561
I did it!

371
00:26:13.655 --> 00:26:15.740
The contestant has
gone over the time limit.

372
00:26:17.784 --> 00:26:19.119
She's right.

373
00:26:24.624 --> 00:26:27.210
Would anyone else like to try?

374
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:32.215
I'll go.

375
00:26:33.174 --> 00:26:34.341
What are you doing?

376
00:26:34.342 --> 00:26:35.217
I can do this.

377
00:26:35.218 --> 00:26:36.720
Don't you want to get out of here alive?

378
00:26:38.054 --> 00:26:39.598
I'm sorry.

379
00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:43.810
Carrie. this is suicide.

380
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.157
And your time starts now.

381
00:26:57.198 --> 00:26:58.867
Wait. wait. wait.

382
00:27:09.544 --> 00:27:12.005
Help me understand

383
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.425
This is a way out.

384
00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:19.304
It's risky. but it is a way out.

385
00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:22.932
And I want out.

386
00:27:24.267 --> 00:27:26.352
But I'm risking my whole life anyway.

387
00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:31.274
if I just go back to my stupid retail job
and singing in

388
00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:36.946
bars. whatever. I get the chance to drunks
who aren't even paying attention to me.

389
00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:41.743
It's a risk either way

390
00:27:43.953 --> 00:27:45.996
But something

391
00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:48.124
got us all here in the first place.

392
00:27:51.127 --> 00:27:53.671
Or I could stay here.

393
00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:56.299
and I can try to change things for myself

394
00:27:57.801 --> 00:28:00.302
and to have an audience of people

395
00:28:00.303 --> 00:28:03.890
who actually care to listen.

396
00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:08.603
Now that I've finally got my shot.

397
00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:11.731
I gotta fucking take it.

398
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.957
Women. right?

399
00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:33.920
Wow! Only six contestants left.

400
00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:38.466
Now put your blindfolds on and
you'll be escorted back to the barracks.

401
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.846
Game four is up next.

402
00:28:57.193 --> 00:28:58.069
Hey

403
00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:02.741
Ready to bring the contestants back in?

404
00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:09.080
You understand
any disloyalty will be punished by death.

405
00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.624
Jesus. again. with a loyalty thing?

406
00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.502
JaxPro saved my life.

407
00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:16.421
And he gave me millions.

408
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:18.381
We all have our reasons.

409
00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:22.509
Hand it over.

410
00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:26.055
Listen. I'm here to do a job
and do it well. so please...

411
00:29:39.235 --> 00:29:41.571
Why are you packing already?

412
00:29:41.654 --> 00:29:43.990
I'm just excited.

413
00:29:52.081 --> 00:29:52.874
Who's that?

414
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.043
Just my mom.

415
00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:57.212
Ew. Gross.

416
00:29:59.047 --> 00:30:01.341
I'm going to go call her.

417
00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:03.259
Mm hmm.

418
00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:16.648
You got it?

419
00:30:20.568 --> 00:30:21.652
How much do I use?

420
00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:23.905
A teaspoon. Any more.
and he'll taste it.

421
00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:25.156
Got it.

422
00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:28.075
When am I getting paid?

423
00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:30.160
He's cashing out after Game seven.

424
00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:31.871
That's what I'm going
to do it stop by then.

425
00:30:32.372 --> 00:30:32.956
Got it.

426
00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:37.043
Thank you.

427
00:30:37.752 --> 00:30:39.796
It's my pleasure. believe me.

428
00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:01.776
Let's find a way out here.

429
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.652
What about him?

430
00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:05.696
He hasn't moved in two hours.

431
00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:07.448
Something's wrong.

432
00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:09.701
This is our chance.

433
00:31:09.993 --> 00:31:10.785
Go check.

434
00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:55.746
What's up. guys?

435
00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:58.750
Welcome to round four of the OctoGames.

436
00:31:59.375 --> 00:32:01.668
Musical chairs.

437
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:05.172
I think these are all going to be kids
games.

438
00:32:05.173 --> 00:32:08.175
Kids games to have a winner
and a loser. Walt.

439
00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:10.261
The rules are simple.

440
00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.557
There are five chairs and six of you.

441
00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:18.561
when the music starts.
you'll walk in a circle around them.

442
00:32:18.978 --> 00:32:22.982
When the music stops.
you must sit down in one of the chairs.

443
00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:25.860
Whoever doesn't is out.

444
00:32:26.653 --> 00:32:29.447
The first person out will be eliminated.

445
00:32:29.822 --> 00:32:33.117
After that.
we will play to determine a winner.

446
00:32:33.743 --> 00:32:37.455
Speaking of winner.
this game does have a prize.

447
00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:43.378
This winner will have one million dollars
deposited into their bank account.

448
00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:47.340
Why would we want a million dollars
if you're just going to kill us?

449
00:32:48.424 --> 00:32:50.717
Don't you guys have like families

450
00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:53.054
that would want it or something?

451
00:32:54.013 --> 00:32:55.807
May the best player win.

452
00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:33.970
AJ!

453
00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:42.061
AJ. no! No!

454
00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:53.156
All rise.

455
00:34:04.083 --> 00:34:06.335
Now to get that million.

456
00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:09.963
Split it with me
if I get myself eliminated?

457
00:34:09.964 --> 00:34:11.465
How does fifty grand sound?

458
00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:13.176
Works for me.

459
00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.526
Stop. stop. stop. stop. stop.

460
00:34:31.527 --> 00:34:33.529
It's OK. it's OK.

461
00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.318
Fuck you.

462
00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:19.951
Fuck it. Whatever.

463
00:35:42.682 --> 00:35:44.809
Don't even try it.

464
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:56.237
This is fun!

465
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.833
AJ! You're OK.

466
00:36:11.377 --> 00:36:14.672
Barely. but yeah.

467
00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:19.135
Wait. what's going on?

468
00:36:19.802 --> 00:36:20.886
Hey. guys.

469
00:36:20.887 --> 00:36:23.556
So I wanted to make this game
a little more interesting.

470
00:36:24.056 --> 00:36:27.226
Eliminating the first person.
is a little boring.

471
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.397
so I decided why not make winning
this prize more intense?

472
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:35.818
Two of you remain
one of you will get the prize.

473
00:36:36.485 --> 00:36:38.029
The other will die.

474
00:36:39.572 --> 00:36:40.781
Good luck.

475
00:36:45.161 --> 00:36:48.163
Well. may the best man win.

476
00:36:48.164 --> 00:36:49.540
Bite me.

477
00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:35.044
We gotta take him down.

478
00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.182
Look. I'm not asking you to help me win.

479
00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:52.603
I'm asking you to help me stop him.

480
00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:00.945
I'm in.

481
00:38:02.154 --> 00:38:03.447
Me. too.

482
00:38:07.994 --> 00:38:08.536
Thank you.

483
00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:10.288
You won't regret it.

484
00:38:15.584 --> 00:38:17.295
I was wrong about you.

485
00:38:17.837 --> 00:38:18.713
Sorry.

486
00:38:19.213 --> 00:38:20.047
I know.

487
00:39:04.884 --> 00:39:07.094
There she is.

488
00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.597
Where am I?

489
00:39:10.598 --> 00:39:13.809
That doesn't matter.
you impressed me back there.

490
00:39:14.393 --> 00:39:16.937
I wanted to meet you.

491
00:39:17.146 --> 00:39:18.188
JaxPro?

492
00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.565
In the flesh.

493
00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:23.401
Oh my God.

494
00:39:23.402 --> 00:39:26.280
No offense. but you're fucking crazy.

495
00:39:27.448 --> 00:39:29.241
And I like that.

496
00:39:29.617 --> 00:39:32.453
So I have a little proposition for you.

497
00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:35.873
I want you to help me

498
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.918
with the rest of the games.

499
00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:43.171
Are you going to kill me?

500
00:39:43.172 --> 00:39:45.424
No. I'm going to hire you.

501
00:39:45.841 --> 00:39:47.968
Two million dollars.

502
00:39:48.177 --> 00:39:50.596
And once we're done. I'll let you go.

503
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.100
I'm in

504
00:39:54.642 --> 00:39:55.476
good.

505
00:39:56.143 --> 00:39:57.603
And you know what?

506
00:39:59.313 --> 00:40:02.108
The fun is just beginning.

507
00:40:11.325 --> 00:40:12.492
Fifty grand.

508
00:40:12.493 --> 00:40:13.786
Man of my word.

509
00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:15.538
It was beautiful.

510
00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:18.374
Carrie actually thought
I was doing her a favor.

511
00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:20.917
So how's that going. huh?

512
00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:21.876
Any new information?

513
00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:24.129
Not really. Just a bunch of ditzy kids.

514
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:25.673
just like I suspected.

515
00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:29.301
So what's this I hear...

516
00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:31.470
about y'all trying to take me down?

517
00:40:33.514 --> 00:40:35.099
How'd you hear that?

518
00:40:35.474 --> 00:40:36.142
I didn't.

519
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:38.393
Just a lucky guess.

520
00:40:38.394 --> 00:40:39.811
No. no. See what I was doing. I was...

521
00:40:39.812 --> 00:40:40.896
Listen. Walt.

522
00:40:41.355 --> 00:40:43.899
I will break your fat fucking neck

523
00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:45.443
if you betray my trust.

524
00:40:47.319 --> 00:40:48.194
You understand me?

525
00:40:48.195 --> 00:40:49.113
Yes. sir.

526
00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:52.158
Atta boy.

527
00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:01.834
I don't trust him.

528
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.211
Don't have to.

529
00:41:04.587 --> 00:41:07.506
We just have to believe that taking down
Squish is in his best interest.

530
00:41:08.716 --> 00:41:09.925
Which it is.

531
00:41:11.844 --> 00:41:13.846
I think he's playing the field.

532
00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:16.014
That can only backfire for him.

533
00:41:16.015 --> 00:41:17.599
He can't be that dumb.

534
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.184
Oh my God.

535
00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:21.060
This is driving me crazy.

536
00:41:21.061 --> 00:41:22.938
I feel so hopeless.

537
00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.277
I mean.
it's basically a hostage situation.

538
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:31.614
I just wanted to boost my music career.

539
00:41:33.866 --> 00:41:35.325
This isn't your fault.

540
00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:37.119
You know that. right?

541
00:41:38.245 --> 00:41:40.414
I could have gotten out
through the obstacle course.

542
00:41:40.748 --> 00:41:43.416
Hey. that thing was a death trap

543
00:41:43.417 --> 00:41:44.668
and you know it.

544
00:41:47.755 --> 00:41:49.381
I guess so.

545
00:41:57.223 --> 00:42:00.226
I really wish we had met
on the outside of all this.

546
00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:05.064
We could have done. like. a
project together or something.

547
00:42:12.947 --> 00:42:14.447
Put on your blindfolds

548
00:42:14.448 --> 00:42:16.992
and prepare for Game five.

549
00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:20.704
Who is that?

550
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:30.797
Second half.

551
00:42:30.798 --> 00:42:32.049
we still good?

552
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.733
Everyone take off your blindfolds.

553
00:43:00.202 --> 00:43:02.829
We need to find a way out of here.

554
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:04.747
We should go for a window.

555
00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:06.499
The doors are probably locked.

556
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.334
Let's just keep an eye out.

557
00:43:08.335 --> 00:43:11.130
And if one of us escapes we'll send help.

558
00:43:11.297 --> 00:43:13.173
Man. that new guard is kind of short.

559
00:43:14.842 --> 00:43:15.842
Looks like the old guard

560
00:43:15.843 --> 00:43:16.969
got left in the dryer.

561
00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:21.056
What. you don't recognize her?

562
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:22.766
No. should I?

563
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.355
What's up. guys?

564
00:43:29.356 --> 00:43:31.274
Welcome to Game five.

565
00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:32.942
Hide and seek.

566
00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.902
Only five of you remain.

567
00:43:34.903 --> 00:43:36.989
The rules are obvious

568
00:43:37.531 --> 00:43:40.868
You will have sixty seconds to hide
anywhere in this house.

569
00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:44.872
After that.
The Eliminator will try to find you

570
00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:48.667
the first person he finds is out.

571
00:43:49.877 --> 00:43:51.295
Good luck.

572
00:43:57.134 --> 00:44:01.513
60. 59. 58.

573
00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:06.477
57. 56. 55

574
00:44:48.894 --> 00:44:49.894
Shit

575
00:44:49.895 --> 00:44:50.395
Maxine.

576
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:52.730
Get over here with me.

577
00:44:52.731 --> 00:44:53.606
It's fine.

578
00:44:53.607 --> 00:44:55.776
I'll find somewhere else to hide.

579
00:44:56.944 --> 00:44:59.446
24. 23.

580
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.659
22. 21. 20.

581
00:45:04.785 --> 00:45:10.624
19. 18. 17. 16. 15.

582
00:45:11.458 --> 00:45:13.627
14. 13.

583
00:45:19.133 --> 00:45:20.299
Can I squeeze
back there with you?

584
00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.635
I mean. you can try.

585
00:45:22.928 --> 00:45:23.846
Maxine.

586
00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:30.936
Ten. Nine.

587
00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:35.524
Eight. Seven. Six.

588
00:45:39.486 --> 00:45:40.362
Thank you.

589
00:45:41.697 --> 00:45:43.949
Five. Four.

590
00:45:44.658 --> 00:45:48.579
Three. Two. One.

591
00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:51.706
Ready or not.

592
00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:53.584
here he comes.

593
00:47:41.275 --> 00:47:43.234
No. no!

594
00:47:43.235 --> 00:47:44.778
Get the fuck out!

595
00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.826
Stop!

596
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.247
What are you doing?

597
00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:58.500
Please.

598
00:48:01.962 --> 00:48:03.213
I'm sorry.

599
00:48:32.367 --> 00:48:33.035
What are you doing?

600
00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:34.211
What are you doing?

601
00:48:34.703 --> 00:48:35.704
What are you doing?

602
00:48:35.871 --> 00:48:36.788
I'm so sorry.

603
00:49:07.736 --> 00:49:08.986
Hey. hey. hey.

604
00:49:08.987 --> 00:49:10.112
Look at me.

605
00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:11.114
It was you or her.

606
00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:12.031
Okay?

607
00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:13.199
You or her.

608
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.034
You did good.

609
00:49:21.249 --> 00:49:22.334
Please.

610
00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:24.461
Please.

611
00:49:36.348 --> 00:49:37.641
Carrie!

612
00:49:38.225 --> 00:49:39.643
Maxine!

613
00:49:47.693 --> 00:49:49.111
Maxine!

614
00:50:11.758 --> 00:50:16.847
I'm so sorry. Maxine.

615
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.729
What happened.

616
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:27.691
Squish. crammed into the closet
with me and Maxine

617
00:50:27.983 --> 00:50:30.318
and then he threw out when he heard
somebody coming in.

618
00:50:35.407 --> 00:50:36.323
It's nothing personal.

619
00:50:36.324 --> 00:50:38.243
Someone has to lose.

620
00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:40.579
We're down to four.

621
00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:46.167
Carrie. I'm so sorry. it happened so fast.

622
00:50:46.168 --> 00:50:47.544
Go away.

623
00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:03.101
Ruth

624
00:51:06.146 --> 00:51:06.979
You were still breathing

625
00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.648
when they drug you out.

626
00:51:11.026 --> 00:51:13.028
I'm going to make sure you lose.

627
00:51:26.666 --> 00:51:29.251
So. game seven's coming up.

628
00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:30.086
Mm-Hmm.

629
00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:31.337
What's the plan?

630
00:51:31.338 --> 00:51:34.965
Well. we're going to cash out that night
and then right after Game eight.

631
00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:38.095
we're going to upload the video and he's
going to fly us out to the island.

632
00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:39.930
Good. good.

633
00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:42.766
How are things with Ruth?

634
00:51:43.642 --> 00:51:46.019
As if on cue.

635
00:51:51.149 --> 00:51:53.401
Hi!

636
00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:01.367
Ruth. this is my girlfriend.

637
00:52:01.368 --> 00:52:03.787
Oh. Luna Laughlin.

638
00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:07.207
Oh my God.
you're just as gorgeous in person.

639
00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:10.168
You're so sweet.

640
00:52:11.169 --> 00:52:11.710
Come on.

641
00:52:11.711 --> 00:52:13.171
I'll give you the tour.

642
00:52:17.175 --> 00:52:20.846
Enjoy him while you can. honey.

643
00:52:26.434 --> 00:52:27.018
Hey.

644
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:29.896
Good work. back there.

645
00:52:30.063 --> 00:52:30.814
Thanks.

646
00:52:33.859 --> 00:52:35.360
Final four.

647
00:52:37.612 --> 00:52:40.198
Happens when it's just you and me?

648
00:52:40.532 --> 00:52:43.451
Well. I guess the best man wins.

649
00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:57.506
I was

650
00:52:57.507 --> 00:53:00.427
almost out.

651
00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:05.140
If the guard didn't see you.
you would have escaped. right?

652
00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:07.058
Right.

653
00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:09.894
That means there's holes in their design.

654
00:53:09.895 --> 00:53:12.564
We just have to wait for the next one.

655
00:53:13.732 --> 00:53:16.318
What if I'm not alive in the next one?

656
00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:34.127
Oh my god. will you quit your whining?

657
00:53:35.587 --> 00:53:37.797
Who the hell do you think you are?

658
00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.511
I'm just a guy in a game of life or death
and treating it as such.

659
00:53:43.803 --> 00:53:46.431
You killed an innocent person.

660
00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:49.309
No. I didn't.

661
00:53:49.976 --> 00:53:51.061
He did.

662
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:58.693
You're evil.

663
00:53:58.735 --> 00:53:59.402
You know?

664
00:53:59.861 --> 00:54:01.362
Yeah? Why?

665
00:54:01.363 --> 00:54:03.865
Because I'm fighting for my survival
just like you?

666
00:54:05.158 --> 00:54:07.993
Because you only think about yourself.

667
00:54:07.994 --> 00:54:10.956
So you tell me.
what do I get out of helping any of you?

668
00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:14.793
Right.

669
00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:22.926
This.

670
00:54:23.677 --> 00:54:25.010
Is my studio.

671
00:54:25.011 --> 00:54:28.515
Oh. wow.
so this is where everything happens.

672
00:54:31.017 --> 00:54:32.142
What's up. guys?

673
00:54:32.143 --> 00:54:33.520
JaxPro here.

674
00:54:36.648 --> 00:54:37.315
Locked.

675
00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:38.774
Now...

676
00:54:38.775 --> 00:54:42.404
there is one more thing
I'm going to need you to do for me.

677
00:54:43.488 --> 00:54:45.699
Anything for you.

678
00:54:57.919 --> 00:55:01.756
Today was your audition and you passed.

679
00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:04.384
Congratulations.

680
00:55:04.843 --> 00:55:08.972
This one was caught by another guard
carrying cyanide

681
00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:12.851
most likely to try and kill me.

682
00:55:17.022 --> 00:55:18.440
You know what to do?

683
00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:55.643
Y'know we could just take our chances
and run for it.

684
00:55:56.311 --> 00:55:57.687
They'd shoot us on sight.

685
00:55:59.314 --> 00:56:00.189
What if we rushed them?

686
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:01.565
They can't take us all out at once.

687
00:56:01.566 --> 00:56:03.400
You rush them. I'll
fight every one of you.

688
00:56:03.401 --> 00:56:04.860
The hell is wrong with you?

689
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:06.862
I'm about to win this thing
and everybody knows it.

690
00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:09.949
You almost lost the last game.

691
00:56:10.742 --> 00:56:12.202
Careful. Carrie.

692
00:56:12.952 --> 00:56:15.205
You remember what happened to Ruth?

693
00:56:16.581 --> 00:56:18.207
What's up. guys?

694
00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.418
Welcome to Game six.

695
00:56:20.919 --> 00:56:23.671
tether ball. a playground favorite.

696
00:56:23.922 --> 00:56:26.340
What's with all the kids games?

697
00:56:26.341 --> 00:56:28.468
Who do you think watches my videos?

698
00:56:30.011 --> 00:56:32.554
The rules are simple.

699
00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:34.848
hit the ball all the way around the pole

700
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:40.271
and you win. we'll be playing three rounds
of one on one tether ball

701
00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:44.567
AJ versus Walt and Carrie versus Squish.

702
00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.654
The losers will
then play each other in the final round

703
00:56:48.655 --> 00:56:50.906
to determine who is eliminated.

704
00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:52.825
Still feeling so cocky?

705
00:56:52.826 --> 00:56:56.704
We will be playing Game
seven later this evening and tomorrow

706
00:56:57.038 --> 00:56:59.165
we'll be playing the final game.

707
00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:00.750
Good luck.

708
00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:14.263
Oh. my God.

709
00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:16.141
God... Okay...

710
00:57:27.527 --> 00:57:30.405
first up is Walt and A.J..

711
00:57:46.713 --> 00:57:49.256
Sorry we have to do this.

712
00:57:49.257 --> 00:57:51.258
I can see right through you.

713
00:57:51.259 --> 00:57:54.929
I don't know what it is you think you see.
but I promise you. I want what you want.

714
00:57:55.221 --> 00:57:57.598
I know you killed Maxine.

715
00:57:57.599 --> 00:57:58.391
What?

716
00:57:58.892 --> 00:57:59.559
Why would I?

717
00:58:00.518 --> 00:58:01.478
Ah! Jesus!

718
00:58:02.645 --> 00:58:04.939
AJ. you got this. C'mon c'mon c'mon!

719
00:58:05.482 --> 00:58:07.692
Go. A.J.. Come on.

720
00:58:08.902 --> 00:58:10.528
Come on. Walt.

721
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.533
Come on. you can do this.

722
00:58:16.534 --> 00:58:17.827
Come on. keep going.

723
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.123
Yes!

724
00:58:24.501 --> 00:58:27.753
Oh. fuck me!

725
00:58:27.754 --> 00:58:29.130
And that's for Maxine.

726
00:58:36.596 --> 00:58:39.390
The winner is A.J.

727
00:58:41.893 --> 00:58:43.727
Take that. Boomer.

728
00:58:43.728 --> 00:58:46.648
Next up is Carrie and Squish.

729
00:58:52.987 --> 00:58:54.113
For the record...

730
00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:57.282
Walt killed Maxine.

731
00:58:57.283 --> 00:58:58.408
Only because I told him to.

732
00:58:58.409 --> 00:59:00.202
That's not true.

733
00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:03.373
I guess it's your word against mine.

734
00:59:32.026 --> 00:59:32.944
Good job

735
00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:35.905
The winner is Squish.

736
00:59:40.034 --> 00:59:41.619
What the hell was that?

737
00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:45.581
Think about it. I could either
lose to you. hurt my hands

738
00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:47.792
and then play Walt. Or...

739
00:59:48.876 --> 00:59:51.045
I could let you win.

740
00:59:51.129 --> 00:59:54.132
And play Walt with clean hands.

741
00:59:55.174 --> 00:59:57.843
You're not the only one who can play
smart.

742
00:59:57.844 --> 00:59:59.971
That's not fair.

743
01:00:01.889 --> 01:00:04.809
That's what I'm talking about.
that's playing smart.

744
01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:08.021
Next up is Walt and Carrie.

745
01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:13.067
Well.

746
01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.695
Nice knowing you. Walt.

747
01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:19.240
Goddammit...

748
01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:31.711
Carrie. please. no...

749
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:34.255
you know. to do this
to me. Carrie. please.

750
01:00:36.382 --> 01:00:37.717
Yes. come on.

751
01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:43.931
He's fucking done.

752
01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:58.529
Winner is Carrie.

753
01:01:03.117 --> 01:01:05.745
Please. please. no.

754
01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:09.082
I don't want to die.

755
01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:12.000
I see you're finally catching on.

756
01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:12.960
Good job.

757
01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:18.299
Give me one more game.

758
01:01:19.258 --> 01:01:20.385
I don't wanna die.

759
01:01:21.427 --> 01:01:22.970
Guys. do something!

760
01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.764
They're gonna kill me!

761
01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:26.516
Carrie...

762
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.476
oh. Jesus Christ.

763
01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:30.853
Do something!

764
01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:46.285
No...

765
01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:47.995
You were supposed to

766
01:02:27.201 --> 01:02:29.787
I thought we had a deal. You were...

767
01:03:00.401 --> 01:03:02.069
What are you looking at?

768
01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:10.912
Whoa! That was a great game!

769
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:13.038
Only three of you remain.

770
01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:16.666
Carrie. Squish. and AJ

771
01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:19.212
Game seven will be played later tonight.

772
01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:23.174
I'm so excited!

773
01:03:29.013 --> 01:03:31.182
What do we do now?

774
01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:33.851
All I know

775
01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:37.021
is that one of us is going
to make it out of here alive.

776
01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:40.399
It's going to be you or me.

777
01:03:41.859 --> 01:03:43.778
How do you know that?

778
01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:49.116
Cause we're going to
make sure Squish dies.

779
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.663
What if it ends up being you versus me?

780
01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:59.126
We're not going to think about that yet.

781
01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.889
Honey. where's my G-fuel?

782
01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:13.057
It's coming.

783
01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:30.449
Thank you.

784
01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.499
Have you tried this?

785
01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:41.168
Oh. yeah. I hate it.

786
01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:43.880
But like this flavor?

787
01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.090
It's all gross to me.

788
01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:50.553
Every flavor? Come on.

789
01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:53.347
I've tried that one.

790
01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:56.349
No. you haven't this is a new flavor.

791
01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:56.892
Come on.

792
01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.643
Would you just take a sip for me?

793
01:04:58.644 --> 01:05:00.771
Why do you want me
to try this shit so much?

794
01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:05.150
Because I like sharing things
with the people I love. Sue me.

795
01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:07.777
Please just take a sip.

796
01:05:07.778 --> 01:05:09.739
I don't want it.

797
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.210
Luna. try it.

798
01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:25.504
It's nasty.

799
01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:29.759
Try it or I'll hurt you.

800
01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.179
I just had Ruth

801
01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:37.516
kill a guard
because they were caught carrying cyanide.

802
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:41.187
Now I don't know if they were trying
to fuck with the games

803
01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:47.026
or if they were trying to kill me
or they were trying to give it to you.

804
01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:50.988
And if there's nothing in here.
we have nothing to worry about.

805
01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:53.866
Get back here!

806
01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:14.804
You shot her.

807
01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:19.849
Yes. But when I stopped by to

808
01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:23.312
bring you the footage from the game.
I heard you arguing upstairs.

809
01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:28.108
And so when she came down the stairs. I
I just wanted to protect you. JaxPro. I...

810
01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:30.235
I didn't know
what she was going to do to you.

811
01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:32.154
Give me the gun.

812
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.678
Just to be sure.

813
01:06:56.762 --> 01:06:58.639
You did the right thing.

814
01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:01.017
I won't forget this.

815
01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:06.814
You might think what I've done is shocking

816
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:10.233
to me. the OctoGames was the natural

817
01:07:10.234 --> 01:07:12.987
answer to the myriad of problems
life had given me.

818
01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:17.199
Life and the internet treated me
like a product to be bought and sold.

819
01:07:17.616 --> 01:07:20.286
like something to be watched
rather than understood.

820
01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:24.664
So I held the OctoGames. a real life
fight to the death

821
01:07:24.665 --> 01:07:29.545
where people are treated the way
I was treated my entire life as product.

822
01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:35.259
Hmm. That's a hell of a suicide note.

823
01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:38.804
What now?

824
01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:42.433
I pack my bags
and I leave the country after Game eight.

825
01:07:44.643 --> 01:07:45.978
Alone?

826
01:07:47.688 --> 01:07:48.898
I guess so.

827
01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:51.232
What about me?

828
01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:53.778
I'll pay you the two million
tomorrow morning.

829
01:07:54.445 --> 01:07:57.740
You know that's not what I meant.

830
01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:01.409
We couldn't

831
01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:03.537
Why not? We're made for each other.

832
01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:05.456
Yeah. but

833
01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:07.583
you're. like. old and stuff.

834
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.378
But we'll be on an island!
No one can judge us.

835
01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:14.090
I guess that's true

836
01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.635
Better with someone old than
no one at all.

837
01:08:21.222 --> 01:08:25.226
That might just be insane enough to work

838
01:08:26.143 --> 01:08:28.270
you like insane. remember?

839
01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:32.667
What's up. guys?

840
01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:35.796
Welcome to Game seven. Hangman.

841
01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.423
A classroom favorite.

842
01:09:38.424 --> 01:09:40.676
The rules are simple.

843
01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:45.180
We have a mystery phrase
and each of you will take turns

844
01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:48.726
guessing one letter for each letter
you get wrong

845
01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:52.855
you will receive a bigger and bigger
electric shock.

846
01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:56.984
If you guess the phrase.
you'll be released from your chair.

847
01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:59.945
The first person to stop breathing loses.

848
01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:02.280
This one's a fun one.

849
01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:05.409
You have two seconds per guess. Good luck.

850
01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:11.540
Squish.

851
01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:13.209
You're up.

852
01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:16.545
Time's up.

853
01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:21.550
T

854
01:10:25.638 --> 01:10:26.305
L

855
01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:32.310
F

856
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.938
Wrong.

857
01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:39.318
Focus on the vowels.

858
01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:40.236
A

859
01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:43.405
E

860
01:10:46.158 --> 01:10:46.825
O

861
01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:50.996
I

862
01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:54.166
N

863
01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:01.632
Time!

864
01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:13.769
B

865
01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:15.187
Wrong.

866
01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:23.279
S

867
01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:26.739
D

868
01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:28.325
Wrong again

869
01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.546
He's bombing.

870
01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:43.257
It's not over yet.

871
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:45.634
R

872
01:11:46.677 --> 01:11:47.344
Wrong.

873
01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:52.933
M

874
01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:58.397
Time.

875
01:11:59.106 --> 01:12:00.481
No. no. no. no. no. no.

876
01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:01.567
I'll solve it.

877
01:12:04.945 --> 01:12:05.988
Shock him

878
01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.449
No. wait. wait. wait. wait.

879
01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:12.661
Maxine lost the OctoGames.

880
01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:23.088
Shit.

881
01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:36.602
Congratulations.

882
01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:38.687
You can stand over there.

883
01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:47.571
Don't try anything.

884
01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.759
What do we do?

885
01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:15.307
There's no way out.

886
01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:18.394
What are you saying?

887
01:13:25.442 --> 01:13:27.820
You want to compete?

888
01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:32.032
I got this.

889
01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:36.620
Begin

890
01:13:37.538 --> 01:13:38.622
A

891
01:13:45.295 --> 01:13:46.296
Time.

892
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.177
E

893
01:13:52.803 --> 01:13:54.263
AJ. what are you doing?

894
01:13:57.724 --> 01:13:58.725
Time.

895
01:14:01.728 --> 01:14:03.021
AJ. stop!

896
01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:04.940
I

897
01:14:06.191 --> 01:14:07.276
Wrong.

898
01:14:15.075 --> 01:14:16.160
Time.

899
01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:24.001
AJ. please!

900
01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:34.344
U

901
01:14:37.347 --> 01:14:38.682
No...

902
01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:42.227
Time.

903
01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.525
No. no. No no no no.

904
01:15:09.546 --> 01:15:11.797
Very good game. everyone.

905
01:15:11.798 --> 01:15:14.467
Such a tender moment.

906
01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:16.720
I'll see you all tomorrow morning

907
01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:19.723
for the final game.

908
01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:36.657
What do you want?

909
01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:37.866
May the best man win.

910
01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:42.788
Best man?

911
01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:51.338
You have cheated your
way through this whole game.

912
01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:54.173
You have almost lost twice.

913
01:15:54.174 --> 01:15:56.843
You should be dead instead of. AJ

914
01:15:57.636 --> 01:16:00.138
instead of Maxine instead of all of them.

915
01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:04.850
You know.
it doesn't really matter what you think.

916
01:16:04.851 --> 01:16:05.519
Right?

917
01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:15.571
You think this world belongs to you?

918
01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:20.284
To nice people.
to people that play by the rules

919
01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:22.995
that bend over for the will of others?

920
01:16:24.204 --> 01:16:24.871
No.

921
01:16:26.623 --> 01:16:27.123
No.

922
01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:30.168
It belongs to us.

923
01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:33.212
Those that will do whatever it takes.
even if it means throwing

924
01:16:33.213 --> 01:16:36.091
everybody else under the bus.
that's who it belongs to.

925
01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:38.385
Wake up!

926
01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:45.601
You are going to die tomorrow.

927
01:16:47.894 --> 01:16:49.855
And I can't wait.

928
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.806
Uh. I'm looking for Mr. JaxPro?

929
01:17:25.766 --> 01:17:27.267
You're looking at him.

930
01:17:27.851 --> 01:17:28.351
Oh.

931
01:17:29.853 --> 01:17:31.188
Are you... Are you...

932
01:17:33.231 --> 01:17:35.941
Mr. JaxPro. sir. Hi.

933
01:17:35.942 --> 01:17:37.361
It's an honor to finally see your face

934
01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:40.280
Okay just come in.

935
01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:46.787
Wow.

936
01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:52.000
Do you know why I called you here?

937
01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.296
Yes. sir.

938
01:17:56.922 --> 01:17:59.549
Oh. Why?

939
01:18:02.469 --> 01:18:05.013
Because during the. um...

940
01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:06.389
You wanted to

941
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:10.310
Because you ruined the goddamn illusion
during tetherball!

942
01:18:11.728 --> 01:18:12.938
I'm sorry.

943
01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:17.401
You let a boomer take off your mask.

944
01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:22.114
Do you know how
un-scary your fucking face is?

945
01:18:22.322 --> 01:18:24.783
You're a fucking dweeb!

946
01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:26.868
What does that?

947
01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:29.787
The tattoo?

948
01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:30.455
Yes!

949
01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:32.833
Yeah. that's yours.

950
01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:35.167
I know it's my tattoo.

951
01:18:35.168 --> 01:18:36.920
Why do you have it?

952
01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:38.671
Because I look up to you.

953
01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:39.338
That...

954
01:18:39.339 --> 01:18:39.922
Eww!

955
01:18:39.923 --> 01:18:40.589
No!

956
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:43.218
I'm a brand. you're nothing.

957
01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:45.095
I know.

958
01:18:46.012 --> 01:18:46.972
I'm sorry.

959
01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:49.641
Look. I know you hear this a lot.

960
01:18:49.933 --> 01:18:52.394
but I really am your biggest fan. OK?

961
01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:55.105
And I killed all those people.
just like you asked.

962
01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:57.566
Did you enjoy it?

963
01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:01.403
Well. yeah.

964
01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:03.405
very much.

965
01:19:04.656 --> 01:19:06.656
You know. it's always been a fantasy
of mine to kill someone.

966
01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:09.661
And...

967
01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:13.373
For a kid who never
had anywhere to belong.

968
01:19:14.332 --> 01:19:18.294
who didn't want to end up like everybody
fucking else in this shithole world.

969
01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:20.964
I'm sorry for cussing sir.
but you gave me someone to be.

970
01:19:22.549 --> 01:19:24.717
So you decided to be me.

971
01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:25.635
That's fucking pathetic.

972
01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.636
Ruth!

973
01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:28.596
Wait. wait. no. no.

974
01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.849
Wait. please. please.
no. no. JaxPro. please!

975
01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:31.599
Wait!

976
01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.768
No. no. no. no. no!

977
01:19:39.065 --> 01:19:40.691
What's up. guys?

978
01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:45.071
Welcome to Game eight.
one of you will win it all.

979
01:19:45.655 --> 01:19:47.949
The other will lose their life

980
01:19:48.992 --> 01:19:50.618
as soon as this is over.

981
01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:54.539
Everything will be uploaded to my channel
to be seen by hundreds

982
01:19:54.706 --> 01:19:56.665
of millions of people.

983
01:19:56.666 --> 01:19:58.918
They'll see what you've been through.

984
01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:03.131
The police will ask
all sorts of questions. but I'll be gone.

985
01:20:04.007 --> 01:20:06.510
The final game starts now.

986
01:20:07.135 --> 01:20:09.053
Capture the flag.

987
01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:11.097
The rules are simple.

988
01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:15.018
The first person
to hold the flag for three seconds wins.

989
01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:18.230
You cannot kill
or knock out the other contestant.

990
01:20:18.855 --> 01:20:21.775
If you do. you will be eliminated.

991
01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:25.195
And remember. play smart.

992
01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:27.697
Good luck.

993
01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:31.201
Five.

994
01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:32.536
Four.

995
01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:34.204
Three.

996
01:20:34.704 --> 01:20:35.747
Two.

997
01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:37.666
One.

998
01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:42.796
Here goes nothing.

999
01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:57.894
Hey!

1000
01:21:00.105 --> 01:21:01.147
Let go. Carrie.

1001
01:21:01.648 --> 01:21:03.691
Everything I did was for this moment.

1002
01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:05.860
You will not take this from me.

1003
01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:07.236
He's going to knock her out.

1004
01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:07.903
Wait.

1005
01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:10.407
I have a clear shot right now.

1006
01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.409
Not yet.

1007
01:21:12.492 --> 01:21:15.244
You played well. Let it go.

1008
01:21:15.245 --> 01:21:16.830
It's nothing personal.

1009
01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:45.478
Congratulations! You're the
official winner of the OctoGames!

1010
01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:56.174
Hello?

1011
01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:04.641
It's OK. it's OK. it's OK.

1012
01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:07.435
You're safe now.

1013
01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:08.812
You won.

1014
01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:13.942
Where am I?

1015
01:25:14.984 --> 01:25:16.528
Your new home.

1016
01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:21.032
The video has been uploaded.

1017
01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:23.784
The police will likely start

1018
01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.703
an investigation.

1019
01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:28.873
Carrie.

1020
01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:33.294
What you do next

1021
01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:35.547
is up to you.

1022
01:25:42.262 --> 01:25:43.138
Wait.

1023
01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:49.394
Who are you?

1024
01:26:05.285 --> 01:26:06.744
Be careful.

1025
01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:11.457
I'm still rooting for you.

1026
01:26:36.482 --> 01:26:39.777
911. what's your emergency?

1027
01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:51.289
Hey. did you watch the song I just posted?

1028
01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:54.918
Yeah. 200.000 views in one night.
I mean. that's amazing.

1029
01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:56.127
How do you feel?

1030
01:26:57.837 --> 01:27:00.256
You mean... To be the OctoGames girl?

1031
01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:03.258
Yeah. but people are watching.

1032
01:27:03.259 --> 01:27:05.720
That's what she wanted. isn't it?

1033
01:27:07.388 --> 01:27:09.890
I guess I really don't know anymore.

1034
01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:12.184
Hey. did you see the video I sent you?

1035
01:27:12.185 --> 01:27:13.560
No. not yet.

1036
01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:15.563
Watch it and call me back.

1037
01:27:15.813 --> 01:27:16.856
Ok.

1038
01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:22.986
What is up. you guys.

1039
01:27:22.987 --> 01:27:26.824
it is your boy. Chip Chip Chippy McDaniel
here coming at you with another video.

1040
01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:29.953
I'm here. girlfriend. Ruth!

1041

We're going to try candies from all
over the world. including Japan! Kawaii!

1042
01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:38.044
But first.
we're filming from a secure compound.

1043
01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:40.088
You know what's not
secure? Your wi-fi at a...
