00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.440
GERMANY. SPRING 1945

4
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.600
There he is!

5
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.480
Yeah!

6
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.800
Let's go!

7
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.560
Right.

8
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.720
Now we shoot for real.

9
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.960
Fuck!

10
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.320
Move! Get that son of a bitch!

11
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.600
The rest of you too!

12
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.120
Keep going!

13
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.560
Got you. Private.

14
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.240
I want him alive.

15
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.640
Our mission can wait.

16
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.960
Sergeant…

17
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.440
Desertion is treason. Private.

18
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.960
Treason against the Führer.
treason against the Fatherland…

19
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640
Treason.

20
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.960
Poland. France. Italy. Russia.
You've been around.

21
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.440
Shit. Köhler. Be careful. you dumbass.

22
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.440
"Iron Cross."

23
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.160
"Tank Destruction Badge."

24
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.720
Close Combat Clasp in bronze.

25
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.320
And a face like something Arno Breker
sculpted in marble to go with it.

26
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.200
Aryan blood in the veins.
but the heart of a coward.

27
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.360
You're a disgrace.

28
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.000
What is your reason
for betraying the Fatherland?

29
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.120
I never wanted this war.

30
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.000
Nobody asked me.

31
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.560
They just put me in this uniform.
and I fought anyway.

32
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.520
For six years. Six senseless years.

33
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.000
I'm done with this madness.

34
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.960
We've all had to take a lot of beatings.
and. yes. we're on our knees.

35
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.400
But we're not down yet.

36
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.680
We will get back up.
and we will strike back.

37
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.600
It's in our blood!

38
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.000
We fight. we suffer. we bleed. and we die.

39
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.080
But we are a nation of winners.

40
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.600
We are a nation of murderers.

41
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.240
You're a tough son of a bitch.
I'll give you that.

42
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.920
It won't break your neck right away.

43
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.120
That way. you'll suffer a little longer.

44
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.400
Once you've pissed and shat your pants

45
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.560
and your swollen tongue is hanging
out of your mouth like an old rag.

46
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.560
you'll be glad to finally get to croak.

47
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.200
Dörfler. you sick bastard!

48
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.680
We're ready.

49
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.400
-And now let's go get the gold.
-At last!

50
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.880
There's Daddy!

51
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.480
Daddy. come with us.

52
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.240
No. Karl. he can't.
Daddy has to stay here.

53
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.600
He needs to take care of Lottchen now.

54
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.160
-Farewell.
-Mommy. Karl! Wait for me!

55
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.560
Lottchen…

56
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.320
Daddy?

57
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.680
Daddy?

58
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.720
Daddy. don't leave me on my own.

59
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.080
Soldiers!

60
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.000
Dad. soldiers!

61
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.680
What. here in our village?
Brigitte. the Americans are here!

62
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.800
No. Dad. It's our people. The SS. I think.

63
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.240
What?

64
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.080
Oh God. Get the portrait
from the cellar and hang it up again.

65
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.840
I'm not your lackey. Robert.

66
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.160
Elisabeth…

67
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.080
My name is Elsa. soldier.

68
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.400
Hey! Let go of her!

69
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.840
It's all right. Paule.

70
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.640
That's my brother.

71
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.360
The paste helps.

72
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.720
Elsa made it herself.

73
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.920
Paule has a very special gift.

74
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.440
You're pretty strong.
Just like Reichsmarschall Gustav.

75
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.000
Our old ox.

76
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.320
Right. now we can strap you
to our plow too.

77
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.720
I don't think that's a good idea.
You have to rest.

78
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.640
You must be hungry. soldier.

79
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.120
My name

80
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.200
is Heinrich.

81
00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.800
Lieutenant Colonel!

82
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.480
Robert Schlick.

83
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.360
Mayor and local group leader.
at your service.

84
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.280
Johannes Löwenstein.

85
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.800
Does the name mean anything to you. Mayor?

86
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.800
Yes. he was a Jew
who used to live here in the village.

87
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.600
Well. his parents and siblings did.

88
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.120
Löwenstein himself lived in Essen
but came to visit them regularly.

89
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.520
Take us to the Löwensteins' house.

90
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.720
But they're not here anymore.

91
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.880
I'm proud to report that our village
has been free of Jews since November '38--

92
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.200
Take us to the house.

93
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.920
Just as you wish.

94
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.680
Please follow me
through our lovely village.

95
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.680
It was a beautiful house
but also a beautiful fire.

96
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.120
A few days after we chased away
the Jewish scum.

97
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.440
If you play with fire--

98
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.600
What happened to the Jews' belongings?
Did they take anything with them?

99
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.760
We allowed them to take some clothes.
That's all.

100
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.080
Was the house looted?

101
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.480
Well. Möller took
some pieces of furniture.

102
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.000
and some of the women took dishes
and bedding and stuff.

103
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.080
But nothing else.

104
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.400
American low-fliers.

105
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.480
They've been buzzing around like mosquitos
for days. More and more of them.

106
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.560
You can go.

107
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.240
If I need you. I'll send for you.

108
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.800
With pleasure. Lieutenant Colonel.

109
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.040
Oh. I just wanted to say.

110
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.200
I also run the Kronprinz Rudolf inn
here in the village.

111
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.880
And. well. we don't have much.

112
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.560
but what we have. we'd be happy to share
with you and your men. Lieut--

113
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.480
-That goes without saying.
-Yes.

114
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.600
We have to take it apart. stone by stone.
It'll be a pain in the ass.

115
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.920
If you'd shown a bit more restraint.

116
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.800
the Jew would have told us
the exact hiding place.

117
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.720
They want the gold.

118
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.080
-Tell me. Robert.
-Yes. yes. yes.

119
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.520
Then let's get out of here.
We can start over somewhere else.

120
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.680
How do you imagine that working?
It's not as simple as that.

121
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.800
I have children.

122
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.200
Yes. funny that.
Even though you've got no balls.

123
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.560
Sonja!

124
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.640
Why are you helping me?

125
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.920
Because I hate those Nazi bastards.

126
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.840
Those pigs killed our father.

127
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.400
They took him two years ago
for making subversive statements.

128
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.800
He never came back.

129
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.120
The same people who ratted on him
then drove us from our farm.

130
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.920
I wouldn't want anyone
to take a closer look at Paule.

131
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.920
Because I'm such a handsome guy!

132
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.240
Yes. We've been here ever since.

133
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.520
Now I've ruined your appetite. huh?

134
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.560
-I'll tell you one of Dad's Hitler jokes.
-Oh yeah!

135
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.880
Come on. Brigitte.
Get a move on. The gentlemen are thirsty.

136
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.800
See to it. then.

137
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.960
"My dear Yank whore…"

138
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.360
-Here you go.
-What the hell. Dörfler. you asshole!

139
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.480
What? For a few nylon stockings.
she'd suck any cock.

140
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.880
Control yourselves. gentlemen.

141
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.360
Don't you have
anything better than this slop?

142
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.960
I'm sorry. Sergeant.

143
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.560
We've got turnips
coming out of our ears too.

144
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.800
For someone who's starving.
your boy looks in good shape.

145
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.360
-That's right.
-Tell me.

146
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.680
Why is a strapping lad
such as yourself not at the front.

147
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.760
defending our Fatherland. huh?

148
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.800
Micha. go to the kitchen. Peel potatoes.

149
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.920
Order a foraging expedition
to all farmyards tomorrow morning.

150
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.840
We need rations urgently.

151
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.400
Who knows when we'll get
another opportunity.

152
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.320
Three beers.

153
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.160
This inn is my headquarters now.

154
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.880
Civilians may not enter.

155
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.600
Look.

156
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.280
I think that's Dresden.

157
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.840
Shit. My aunt lives there.

158
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.440
The early bird catches the worm!

159
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.680
Speaking of gold.

160
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.800
the disfigured man doesn't really think
he'll take it to the Führer?

161
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.720
Wait a sec.

162
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.880
I rounded up everyone who could hold
a shovel. We're making good progress.

163
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.840
We have no time to lose.

164
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.960
The French have crossed the Rhine.

165
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.720
and the Americans are approaching
from the south and west.

166
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.080
Lieutenant Colonel!

167
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.920
What?

168
00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.760
Do you really think we'll manage
to break through enemy lines?

169
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.960
We'll find a way.

170
00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.120
Our men are exhausted.

171
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.720
They will regain strength
in the Alpine Fortress.

172
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.320
We'll be surrounded just as much
in the mountains.

173
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.920
Are you questioning the Führer. Sergeant?

174
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.440
-Have you lost faith in the final victory?
-No--

175
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.960
Or are you thinking of deserting as well?

176
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.320
Like that private.

177
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.120
Of course not!

178
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.080
Victory…

179
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.520
or death.

180
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.040
There is no other option.

181
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.960
I ordered you to secure provisions.

182
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.400
Rogge. move. Get provisions.

183
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.480
You'll take care of it yourself.

184
00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:01.160
-Wouldn't it be better if I stayed here--
-I gave you an order. Sergeant!

185
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.840
Yes. sir!

186
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.720
You're the best. Rita.

187
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.080
Good morning.

188
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.720
I have to go.

189
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.480
You badly needed that sleep.

190
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.160
And a good breakfast. too. I'm sure.

191
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.840
Paule is just getting fresh eggs.

192
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.720
No need.

193
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.840
Why are you in such a hurry to go?

194
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.120
I have to.

195
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.640
Regain your strength first.

196
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.920
Thanks.

197
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.360
I could use some help here.

198
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.080
My wife and my son were killed
in a bombing raid on Hagen.

199
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.160
Elisabeth was seven months pregnant.

200
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.480
But Lottchen survived.

201
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.640
Neighbors wrote to me to say
they took her in.

202
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.800
Then at least put on
some other clothes first.

203
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.440
Or they'll string you up again
at the next corner.

204
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.480
Elsa. there are people coming! A truck!

205
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.360
The same ones?

206
00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.720
Yes.

207
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.440
Krause. Niemann. Get the critters.

208
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.360
Yes. sir!

209
00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.600
Come here. chicken.

210
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.480
Cluck. cluck. here. Come here. Come on!

211
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.080
What an idiot.

212
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.840
Just catch the fucking chicken. Niemann!

213
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.680
What are you doing?

214
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.680
I'm getting provisions for my troops.
Do you have a problem with that?

215
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.600
Great. Niemann. You chicken thief!

216
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.320
But don't take them all.
We need to live too.

217
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.560
You're a dangerous one. huh?

218
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.760
Paule.

219
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.920
Why are they killing our animals?
They're not allowed to.

220
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.840
Don't worry.

221
00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.360
They'll be gone in a minute.

222
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.400
I thought that kind of vermin
had long been eradicated.

223
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.320
-You're not allowed to kill our animals.
-Shut up. moron.

224
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.800
I'm not a moron!

225
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.120
-Who else lives here?
-No one. Just my brother and me.

226
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.640
Why are there three cups?

227
00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.120
My brother doesn't like to drink
from the same cup twice.

228
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.320
So he is a moron.

229
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.640
Disgusting coffee substitute.

230
00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.640
What I wouldn't give
for a really delicious coffee bean!

231
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.080
Don't you have a man?

232
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.040
My fiancé is at war.

233
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.040
Oh yeah? When did he last write to you?

234
00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.920
Long time ago. huh? He's not coming back.

235
00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.400
You know that as well as I do.

236
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.320
Handsome boy.

237
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.480
But he's worm food by now.

238
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.640
Give it back.

239
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.800
Come and get it.

240
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.560
Elsa!

241
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.000
Come on. throw him out!

242
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.480
You miserable little slut!

243
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.840
Stay outside. you subhuman.

244
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.040
No. no. no. no.

245
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.320
Don't just stand there like an idiot!
Hold on to the slut!

246
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.600
-Dörfler. you can't do this.
-Come on. buddy.

247
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.760
Stop!

248
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.080
Let go of me. you pig!

249
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.800
Guys. stop it. please.

250
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.720
Come on.
you haven't fucked for ages either.

251
00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.520
But it's my turn first.

252
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.960
-We're not the fucking Red Army.
-Shut the fuck up. you wimp!

253
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.000
If this gets out. we'll all be shot.

254
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.400
If this gets out. then I'll shoot you.

255
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.440
Here. Just imagine it's him.

256
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.720
Get those long johns off!

257
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.920
You're dead.

258
00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.760
What's going on in there?

259
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.040
Oh fuck!

260
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.040
Fuck!

261
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.200
Paule.

262
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:14.960
It's all right.

263
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.840
It's all right.

264
00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.680
Thanks for the clothes.

265
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.480
These assholes are vacationing
in Sonnenberg.

266
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.480
His name was Hans.

267
00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.720
We'd known each other since childhood.

268
00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.760
We have to go.

269
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.560
We have to take Rita with us!

270
00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.120
Not now.

271
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.000
We can spend the night here.

272
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.600
-What's wrong?
-We have to go back.

273
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.760
We can't go back.

274
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.200
But I have to milk Rita.
Or else she'll scream.

275
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.600
Forget the stupid cow!

276
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.240
Rita isn't stupid.
Rita is having a baby calf!

277
00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.920
They wanted to kill us.
Don't you get that?

278
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.120
There. That was the last stitch.

279
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.600
How could the private have survived?

280
00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.680
No idea.

281
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.880
The farm girl must have cut him down
from the tree.

282
00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.080
-I still have to bandage you up.
-Oh. kiss my ass.

283
00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.920
Are you injured anywhere else?

284
00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.360
No.

285
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.760
Don't worry.

286
00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.280
I'll go back to that fucking farm
tomorrow morning.

287
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.320
To let him escape a third time?

288
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.520
I'll get that bastard.

289
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.240
Come on. Paule. you have to eat something.

290
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.280
Get some rest.

291
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.840
Everything okay?

292
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.760
Paule misses his cow.

293
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.560
I meant how you were doing.

294
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.280
Everything's fine.

295
00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.520
Thanks.

296
00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.040
I've only seen my daughter once
since she was born.

297
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.040
She basically has no idea who I am.

298
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.720
Maybe she's better off without me.

299
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.840
Are you kidding me?

300
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.040
You run through the woods for weeks
and now you're chickening out?

301
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.880
What did I cut you down from the tree for?
I risked my life for you.

302
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.040
Your daughter is the reason
you're still alive.

303
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.360
I'm sure you're a good father.

304
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.600
Elsa?

305
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.120
All good. Paule.

306
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.800
What are you doing?

307
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.280
Nothing. Go to sleep.

308
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.400
Good morning.

309
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.040
Good morning.

310
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.440
Are you still sitting there?

311
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.040
I closed my eyes briefly.

312
00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.680
Blinked or what?

313
00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.680
Hasn't Paule made a peep yet?

314
00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.080
Not yet.

315
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.920
Paule? Where's my coffee?

316
00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.520
Paule?

317
00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.080
Shit.

318
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.200
We have to get out of here fast. Rita.

319
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.400
Look how he runs.

320
00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.440
Look at that moron.

321
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.000
Where are they? Where's the private?

322
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.200
I made them disappear.

323
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.480
Moron.

324
00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.760
You can kill him. Dörfler.
He won't tell you anything.

325
00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.600
Rita!

326
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.600
Rita!

327
00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.440
Throw that sack of meat onto the truck.
And the cow too.

328
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.120
We'll have goulash tonight!

329
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.240
Rita!

330
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.160
Paule!

331
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.320
We'll get him out.

332
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.960
We searched everywhere.
turned over every stone. There's no gold.

333
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.600
-Bring me the mayor.
-Yes. sir.

334
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.640
Have you found the gold?

335
00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.080
What's that?

336
00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.840
The farm girl's brother.

337
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.280
The private?

338
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.560
-No trace.
-Lieutenant Colonel…

339
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.840
Lieutenant Colonel.
how can I be of assistance?

340
00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.840
Where's the gold?

341
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.840
Gold?

342
00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.680
The Jew Löwenstein wanted
to buy his way out.

343
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.160
-From the concentration camp.
-I know nothing about that.

344
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:15.320
We know that the Jew hid a box
with 31 bars in it inside this house.

345
00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.480
All residents of this dump
to the village square.

346
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.840
At twelve o'clock sharp.

347
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.920
Ready…

348
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.200
I AM UNWORTHY OF LIFE

349
00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.640
Don't look.

350
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.120
Come on. This way.

351
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.320
In the name of God. stop!

352
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.200
"Unworthy of life"?

353
00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.680
No life is unworthy.

354
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.800
Stand aside.

355
00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:46.000
Your Jesus. preacher.
was only the son of a Jewish whore.

356
00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.640
and he won't protect you.

357
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.000
What are they going to do to him?

358
00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.920
-Is there another entrance?
-This way.

359
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.760
You there in the house. get out!

360
00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.200
-To the marketplace.
-Elsa?

361
00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.920
The SS have Paule.

362
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.080
Come on. hurry up!

363
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.760
What's going on?

364
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.760
Come with us.

365
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.800
Come on. hurry up!

366
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.840
You can do a gallows knot. right?

367
00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.400
Let's see if his head is torn off
or if he dangles.

368
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:37.040
Ladies and gentlemen. may I present
the Hunchback of Sonnenberg!

369
00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.240
The Hunchback had a hump. you moron!

370
00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.600
Come on!

371
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.040
"Unworthy of life"?

372
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.800
I'll show you who's unworthy of life!

373
00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.480
Move! Find somewhere else.

374
00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.200
They took Paule to the top.

375
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.600
Don't leave me behind!

376
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.440
My rifle!

377
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.360
Come on. Köhler. show us
what you learned at your fucking Napola.

378
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.960
Come on. move!

379
00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.320
I'll show you. Yeah!

380
00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.360
Who's the moron now. huh?

381
00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.600
Paule!

382
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.680
Elsa?

383
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.760
No!

384
00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.480
Paule!

385
00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.600
Paule…

386
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.720
We have to get out of here.

387
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.720
I'll take him.

388
00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.400
Either you tell me now
where the Jew's gold is

389
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.320
or I start shooting people.
one after the other.

390
00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.560
until you tell me!

391
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.480
Please don't!

392
00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.640
-I'll start with your failure of a son!
-Elsa.

393
00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.640
-Please don't!
-Please don't!

394
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.480
Elsa. don't…

395
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.640
Don't shoot!

396
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.640
Private!

397
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.800
Come on. you dogs!

398
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.960
He ran upstairs. Come on. inside!

399
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:09.880
-Yes. sir!
-Inside!

400
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.520
Come on. get the guy!

401
00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.720
Look out!

402
00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.360
Fuck!

403
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.920
-Come on. keep going!
-What about Schröder?

404
00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.520
Private!

405
00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.400
Give me your weapon!

406
00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.320
Private! What's wrong. no more ammo?

407
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.160
He's trapped.

408
00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.120
Go on. get the bastard!

409
00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.520
Move your fat ass. you fucking coward.

410
00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.280
Can you see him anywhere?

411
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.680
Fuck!

412
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.080
Go to hell!

413
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.760
Fuck!

414
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.560
He's going into the house. Go. get him!

415
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.560
Hello. Private.

416
00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.240
Private!

417
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.080
Take cover!

418
00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.120
Come on! Everyone over here!

419
00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.520
Move. you lazy bastards!

420
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.200
You two go that way!

421
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.560
You come with me!

422
00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.960
Look in the barn.
The cockroach must be somewhere.

423
00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.120
Oh my God.

424
00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.160
We've searched the barns. He's not there.

425
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.280
Seal off the streets
so that he can't escape across the fields.

426
00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.200
Yes. sir.

427
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.960
-You come with me.
-Yes. sir.

428
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:55.320
There. I hope this will last
for a while now.

429
00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.520
Thank you.

430
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.640
Are you a soldier?

431
00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.720
I was a soldier.

432
00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.480
My sons.

433
00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.160
Friedhelm was killed in Italy.
Peter in Stalingrad.

434
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.440
Irmgard?

435
00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.400
Wait.

436
00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.880
Where were you?
I've been looking for you all over.

437
00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:32.640
What happened?

438
00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:45.720
This is Heinrich.

439
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.240
He tried to help Elsa free her brother.

440
00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.280
I've buried Paule.

441
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.520
What about Elsa?

442
00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.640
The SS took her to the inn.

443
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.000
Stop.

444
00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.760
You'd better not put
any strain on your leg.

445
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:17.040
It can start bleeding again at any time.
You need to rest now.

446
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.520
Do you know why the SS are here?

447
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.280
They're here for the gold.

448
00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.160
They're serious.

449
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.080
It's a complicated situation.

450
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.040
You saw them. They're going
to shoot everyone. one after the other.

451
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.480
So. what are we going to do?

452
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:13.000
You're crazy. I didn't do this
just to lose everything now.

453
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:17.200
Robert. the war will be over soon.
Then we'll be rich.

454
00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.880
They were going to shoot my son.
We're not in control anymore.

455
00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.440
Robert. wait!

456
00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.520
You'll keep your mouth shut. understand?

457
00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.720
You don't understand.
You don't have a family!

458
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.840
Stay here. You'll keep your mouth shut!

459
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.160
Robert. we can do it!

460
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.840
It's over.

461
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.360
What's all this about?

462
00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.280
Playing cowboys and Indians
without little Sonja?

463
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.360
Just like old times? I was never allowed
to join in then either.

464
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.000
Don't let him suffer too long.

465
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:15.720
Give it to me.

466
00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.640
Please. Wilhelm. Please!

467
00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:27.600
There.

468
00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:29.240
Now what?

469
00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.080
Now we get the gold.

470
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.360
…reached the outskirts of the capital.

471
00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.080
Berlin has thus become a frontline city.

472
00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.120
Defenders of Berlin.

473
00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:51.560
the eyes of your wives. of your mothers.
and of your children are upon you!

474
00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.000
Why aren't you eating?

475
00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.760
The meat is so tender.

476
00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.280
She must have been a happy cow.

477
00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.360
-Hofer.
-Yes. sir.

478
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.640
Take this away.

479
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.240
Wait.

480
00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.520
This too.

481
00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.520
You needn't be afraid of me.

482
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.560
You remind me of a girl I once knew.

483
00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.320
I loved her very much.

484
00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.320
But I couldn't marry her.

485
00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.920
Rebecca was a Jew.

486
00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:29.400
I couldn't stay with her.

487
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.640
And so I shot her.

488
00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:49.160
I didn't want her to be sent to a camp.

489
00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:53.920
I wanted it…

490
00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.520
to be over quickly.

491
00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.920
But I'll make up for it.

492
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.600
I will never leave you.

493
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.080
I will forever protect you.

494
00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.600
Come with me…

495
00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.080
Rebecca.

496
01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.320
The Löwensteins were
the only Jewish family in the village.

497
01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.520
They were such lovely people.

498
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.760
Suddenly. people stirred up hatred
against them.

499
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.560
The mayor was the loudest voice
at community meetings.

500
01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:19.360
He said we had to "fulfill our duty
as National Socialists."

501
01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.040
"This Jewish scum doesn't belong here."

502
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.720
…calling for war on the German people.
shooting down German officials.

503
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.640
That's right!

504
01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.280
That's why I demand vengeance for Rath!

505
01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.720
Vengeance for Rath!

506
01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.400
And in the fall of '38.
shortly before the November pogrom.

507
01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.320
their eldest son. Johannes.
came back to the village.

508
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.600
He lived in Essen.

509
01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.200
He had married into
a wealthy merchant family there

510
01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.840
and taken over the company.

511
01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.240
Then came Kristallnacht.

512
01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.200
Get out! Go! Get out! Your stench
has polluted our town for long enough!

513
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.280
Your town?
My ancestors helped build your town.

514
01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.920
Have you forgotten that already.
Mr. Robert Schlick?

515
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.360
I don't understand you.

516
01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.080
We've never done anything to you.

517
01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.240
You! You murdered Jesus!

518
01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.400
You scum! That's right!

519
01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.200
Since when have you cared about the Lord.
Wilhelm Reinkober?

520
01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.520
I haven't seen you in church for years.

521
01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.920
I care about the well-being
of the German people.

522
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.640
That's right. Die. Jew. die!

523
01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.360
Johannes was sure that something terrible
lay in store for them as Jews here.

524
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.720
He and his wife sold the company

525
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.680
and wanted to go into exile
in Palestine with the Löwensteins.

526
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.320
But… his parents didn't want to go.

527
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.040
They refused.

528
01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.440
This was their home.

529
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.160
They were Germans.

530
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.720
Jewish whore!

531
01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.040
Have you gone mad?
What are you doing? For God's sake!

532
01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.480
The gold must have come from
the proceeds of the company sale.

533
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.360
The angry mob didn't notice it.

534
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.160
Except for Sonja and the other scoundrels.

535
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.160
Just wait!

536
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.000
How is this possible?

537
01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.160
Have you ever seen people in a blood rage?

538
01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.720
I've been at war for six years.

539
01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.640
I've seen myself in a blood rage.

540
01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.960
Die. you swine!

541
01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.960
I was paralyzed.

542
01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.080
I couldn't believe
this was really happening.

543
01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.080
No one ever spoke of that night again.

544
01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.600
It's as if it had never happened.

545
01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.120
As if the Löwensteins had never existed.

546
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.480
There were rumors that Johannes Löwenstein
and his wife were arrested

547
01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.560
before they could board a ship
to Palestine.

548
01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:04.640
That would explain why the SS have left
no stone unturned in the Löwenstein ruin.

549
01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.560
And the gold?

550
01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.880
The mayor. Reinkober. and Wirtz hid it.

551
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.880
They probably wanted to wait
until the dust settled. Then the war came.

552
01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.520
-And now the SS will get the gold.
-No. they won't.

553
01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.400
This isn't possible.

554
01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:32.920
There's…

555
01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:35.840
nothing here.

556
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.040
Where is it?

557
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.160
What is it?
Do you think one of us took it?

558
01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.760
You tell me.

559
01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.560
Robert.

560
01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.920
It could only have been Robert.

561
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.400
Now he's dead.

562
01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.520
Where is the gold?

563
01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.040
You're seeing ghosts.

564
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:02.880
Is she? Or where did you get the money
to repair your roof?

565
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.080
Are you singing the same tune now?
What is this? Maybe you've got it!

566
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.360
Stay away from me. you rotten skunk!

567
01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.800
Shut up. you damn cripple!

568
01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.520
You stupid ass.
Give me my leg back right now!

569
01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.600
Wait. there's something here!

570
01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.160
What is it? The gold?

571
01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.240
"Thou shalt not steal."

572
01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.320
"Thou shalt not kill."

573
01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.520
The goddamn preacher.

574
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.560
Where's the gold now?

575
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.880
In the church.

576
01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.920
We didn't want the murderers
to get the gold.

577
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.320
Show me where the gold is.

578
01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.520
What's your plan?

579
01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.400
We'll give the SS what they want.

580
01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:24.680
If people knew what they'd been praying
in front of all this time…

581
01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.880
What are you doing down there?

582
01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.000
The ring slipped off my finger.
It's a little too big.

583
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.160
We'll adjust it.

584
01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.000
Did you really mean what you said?

585
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.640
What?

586
01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.520
That you'll always protect me.

587
01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.840
Till the end of our days.

588
01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.280
Thank you.

589
01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.440
What have you done?

590
01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.160
I loved my brother. you bastard.

591
01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.080
All right. sleep well. okay?

592
01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.640
No way!
We'll drag the preacher out of bed.

593
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:48.920
No need.

594
01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.640
Don't beat this one to death.
We still need him.

595
01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.320
Oh. he can take it.

596
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:08.360
Right. preacher?

597
01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.040
Here you go.

598
01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.160
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

599
01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.480
Shit!

600
01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.120
The Yanks have broken through the entire
frontline. They'll be here within hours.

601
01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.800
-We're not leaving without the gold.
-The war is lost. You know that.

602
01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.120
What can I do? As long as that madman
in his chimney-sweep outfit is--

603
01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.760
Get down!

604
01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.160
Hey. you in there!

605
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.760
That goddamn private.

606
01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.640
What do you want?

607
01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.560
The girl.

608
01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.400
You get the gold in return.

609
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.320
He has the gold.

610
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.080
No shit.

611
01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.120
I'll get her. Private!

612
01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200
Hurry up!

613
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.040
Lieutenant Colonel!

614
01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.640
Lieutenant Colonel!

615
01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.920
Lieutenant Colonel! The private is here!

616
01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:07.920
He has the gold!

617
01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.440
Lieutenant Colonel?

618
01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:18.560
What's going on?

619
01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.080
Shit.

620
01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:51.040
Where's von Starnfeld?

621
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.000
The fucking coward ate his cyanide capsule

622
01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.000
after preaching to us about final victory.

623
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.040
What an asshole.

624
01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.720
-And the girl?
-The girl's gone.

625
01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.760
Now what?

626
01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.160
Now I'm in charge.

627
01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.200
What about the girl?

628
01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.240
She's with me!

629
01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.040
I'm bringing her out now!

630
01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.480
Stop!

631
01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.800
Send her over alone.

632
01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.360
Go on. fuck off. farm girl!

633
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.120
Faster. Elsa. Hurry up.

634
01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.960
Pull the jacket down.

635
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.280
Get down!

636
01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.200
Braun! What's he doing?

637
01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.080
No idea.

638
01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.280
Cover me.

639
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.720
Understood.

640
01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.720
Thank God!

641
01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:34.640
Where's Heinrich?

642
01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.440
-Why do you ask?
-He wanted to buy your freedom.

643
01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.960
I heard an explosion. And gunshots.

644
01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.160
I have to go back.

645
01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:46.880
But not like that.

646
01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:48.720
Come with me.

647
01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.200
Who do you think shot them all?

648
01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:14.600
Ten-pointers. twelve-pointers. wild boars.
I've had them all in my sights.

649
01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:17.480
It gets dangerous
if you only wound the animal.

650
01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.400
Then you need the hunting knives
and to get up close.

651
01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:23.920
Once. in Nimmertal.
a wounded boar came right at me.

652
01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.920
-I stopped it with this.
-I'd love to hear the story.

653
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.200
But first we have
some Nazi pigs to hunt down.

654
01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.360
Where's the gold?

655
01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.240
Whatever happened to that wonderful girl?

656
01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.680
The one I baptized?

657
01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.800
"Thou shalt not steal"?

658
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.640
Start talking. you dirty thief!

659
01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.280
Did you hear the bang? What was that?

660
01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.520
Hit his knee with the pickax.

661
01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.440
Sonja. please stop.
His screams will rouse the whole village.

662
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.720
Do what you want.

663
01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.480
Then we'll go to Irmgard.

664
01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.840
I know you share a bed with the widow.

665
01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.120
Whatever happened to celibacy?

666
01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.920
They're bandaging him up.

667
01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.840
But we won't call off the hunt
because of that.

668
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.120
"Dear Heinrich."

669
01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.680
"It is so painful
to have to write you these words."

670
01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.000
"Lisbeth and Karl
did not survive the raid."

671
01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.080
"They were buried in the cellar."

672
01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.000
"But Lotte is alive and well."

673
01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.080
"We took her in."

674
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.080
"Take care."

675
01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.320
"Grete."

676
01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.360
It breaks your heart. doesn't it?

677
01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.840
I'm welling up here.

678
01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.440
Nice to have you back. Private.

679
01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.000
You're lucky we have the same blood type.

680
01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.080
And now you show me where the gold is.

681
01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.280
Or else I'll go to Hagen.

682
01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.400
I'll find your brat. I promise you.

683
01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.440
And then I'll drown her in a bucket.

684
01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.720
So.

685
01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.840
where's the gold?

686
01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.880
Okay. where?

687
01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.600
In the altar.

688
01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.080
The marble top can be moved.

689
01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.760
What are you waiting for?

690
01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.200
Okay.

691
01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.400
What were you planning to do?

692
01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.080
Have a nice life together with the widow?

693
01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.360
Maybe not everyone is like you. Sonja.

694
01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.400
Don't act all holier-than-thou.

695
01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.480
Move it. Private.

696
01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.800
Don't pretend to be tired.

697
01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.200
Off to the church!

698
01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:28.960
Wait.

699
01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.960
They're in for a surprise there.

700
01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:34.760
Yes!

701
01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:36.680
The gold is here.

702
01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.400
What's this?

703
01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.320
Motherfucker.

704
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.360
What the fuck was that?

705
01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.720
No idea. Maybe the wrath of God.

706
01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.160
Good morning. preacher!

707
01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.720
Just in time for morning mass!

708
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.960
Holy shit.

709
01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.960
You're a couple
of callous sons of bitches.

710
01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.920
A booby trap?

711
01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.400
-Heinrich.
-Elsa!

712
01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.880
Elsa. stop.

713
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.960
Braun. get a crate from the truck.

714
01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:43.880
Yes. sir.

715
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.120
And you.

716
01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:48.560
come here.

717
01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:59.440
Maybe I'll visit your daughter after all.
What do you think of that?

718
01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.640
Private?

719
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.920
I can't hear you.

720
01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.040
