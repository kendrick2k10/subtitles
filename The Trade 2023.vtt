00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:54.583
Come down from that car now!

4
00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:04.667
Come down!

5
00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:08.958

6
00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.333
Move. are you not listening?

7
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Where is the cloth?

8
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.500
Come...

9
00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:51.375
Are you Chibuzor's boys?

10
00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:52.542
Mister. shut up there.

11
00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:55.875
Van Damme.
where did you say you put the cloth?

12
00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:03.542
Only Ekene can use
children for a job like this.

13
00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:14.083
So. Ekene still operates from prison?

14
00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:17.333
Lion.

15
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.917
- How do you...
- Who are you?

16
00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:26.083
Eric.

17
00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:31.292
How do we know you are really Eric?

18
00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:32.833
Listen...

19
00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:36.042
Do you know who I am to Ekene?

20
00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:39.750
Look at these little things!

21
00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:43.667
Oh! You wanted to kidnap me for Ekene?

22
00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.125
Come on. call him now.

23
00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:48.208
Idiot.

24
00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:57.000
Your phone is ringing.

25
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.875
Hello.

26
00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:07.958
Boss. there is a situation.

27
00:04:08.042 --> 00:04:09.208
What is happening?

28
00:04:09.292 --> 00:04:10.309
The man we carried.
he said he knows you.

29
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.042
The man we carried.
he said he knows you.

30
00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:13.375
He said he's Eric.

31
00:04:14.292 --> 00:04:15.458
Give him the phone.

32
00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:23.917
Ah! Eric!

33
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.458
What are you doing in the East?

34
00:04:25.542 --> 00:04:26.667
My brother.

35
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.292
I was just leaving Uyo
when these little rats shot my tire.

36
00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:33.625
They just spoilt my car.

37
00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:36.333
Where did you even
see these children?

38
00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:42.375
Please don't be angry.
they don't understand the work yet.

39
00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:44.292
How is it over there?

40
00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:46.417
We are managing.

41
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.208
Don't worry. I will send madam something.

42
00:04:49.292 --> 00:04:52.167
Eric! I trust you.

43
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.042
Strong man!

44
00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:56.750
Get this thing away from me.

45
00:04:58.625 --> 00:04:59.625
Hello sir.

46
00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:02.833
You stupid boy.
don't you know who you carried?

47
00:05:02.917 --> 00:05:03.958
Sorry sir.

48
00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:05.601
You better take him back
where you picked him up from.

49
00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:07.208
Nonsense.

50
00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:12.667
Turn around.

51
00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:15.167
Bring my phone.

52
00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:22.167
Hello.

53
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.417
Lawrence.

54
00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:33.458
My name is
Barrister Lawrence Ihemelo. Esq.

55
00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:36.250
My client came to this country
to do business.

56
00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:39.333
but within one month
he was kidnapped.

57
00:05:40.792 --> 00:05:42.583
We paid a ransom last night.

58
00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:48.708
and he was already on the first flight
out of this country. today!

59
00:05:48.792 --> 00:05:52.792
It is you people that paid them.
Did you tell the police?

60
00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:54.042
Tell the police?

61
00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:57.667
So that they will kill him. right?

62
00:05:59.083 --> 00:06:00.083
Okay.

63
00:06:07.792 --> 00:06:14.333
These are the documents of the car.
and we are expecting immediate release.

64
00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:23.458
It's okay.

65
00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:28.542
You will pay twenty five thousand Naira.
to clear this car.

66
00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:30.000
What?

67
00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:32.500
Yes! For the towing and other
miscellaneous services.

68
00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:37.417
What did you say?

69
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.250
ACP Abubakar. please.

70
00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:21.417
Thanks.

71
00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:40.000
What is it?

72
00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:42.917
Sir.

73
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.917
Oh. it’s you. Come in.

74
00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:56.417
So you are the one?

75
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.833
Sir?

76
00:08:58.792 --> 00:09:00.875
The one everybody is talking about.

77
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:02.750
Sir.

78
00:09:04.167 --> 00:09:08.000
You are my biggest inspiration
on the force sir. I just want to learn.

79
00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:10.208
I want to learn from the best. sir.

80
00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:19.167
Hello.

81
00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:21.083
Yes. sir.

82
00:09:23.917 --> 00:09:28.542
I was thinking. this is not the kind of
case we should be handling.

83
00:09:30.792 --> 00:09:34.125
No. sir. I am not questioning...

84
00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:37.958
Okay. sir.

85
00:09:40.417 --> 00:09:41.750
Immediately. sir.

86
00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:53.042
Is my driver outside?

87
00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.375
Yes. sir.

88
00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:57.417
- Mr. Whizkid. are you still standing?
- No. sir.

89
00:10:00.542 --> 00:10:02.583
I am sorry you had to go through all this.

90
00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:07.417
I read the statement you gave the officer
in charge and I have a few questions.

91
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.500
Okay.

92
00:10:09.792 --> 00:10:11.583
Surely this is a case for SARS.

93
00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:13.958
Why will the head of
the Intelligence Response Team

94
00:10:14.042 --> 00:10:15.458
be asked to attend to this?

95
00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:18.375
Welcome to Abuja.

96
00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:22.833
Where a politician's girlfriend
can have even the Inspector General

97
00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:24.500
on her house robbery case.

98
00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:29.500
I thought the IRT is supposed
to be the FBI of Nigeria?

99
00:10:32.292 --> 00:10:33.292
Sorry. sir.

100
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.500
So. this is why you are so gingered?

101
00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:44.375
FBI agent.

102
00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:48.250
Look. I just want to attend to cases
that actually make a difference.

103
00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:52.167
Don't worry.

104
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.417
When you see a case.
you will know that you have seen one.

105
00:11:41.542 --> 00:11:42.792
Welcome. boss.

106
00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:47.375
Good morning.

107
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.500
Is that your brother?

108
00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:53.417
Yes. he just came yesterday
and I have started training him.

109
00:11:55.917 --> 00:11:57.583
Is he smoking weed?

110
00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:00.583
He only smokes it outside.

111
00:12:02.583 --> 00:12:05.208
Please don't be angry.
he won't do it again.

112
00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:10.500
Welcome.

113
00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:17.000
Morning. sir.

114
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.583
Oh no...

115
00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.250
You are getting lean!

116
00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.958
Don't you eat food again?

117
00:12:54.792 --> 00:12:56.542
Kids these days.

118
00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.708
Don't worry.
your mother has finished paying my money.

119
00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:15.833
What?

120
00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:18.583
Yes. you are going home today.

121
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.625
Oh my God.

122
00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:32.333
Alright. come and take the mummy's boy.

123
00:13:43.208 --> 00:13:44.208
Park here.

124
00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:57.750
Take.

125
00:13:57.833 --> 00:13:59.083
What?

126
00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:01.167
Come down. do you want to go back with us?

127
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.250
No.

128
00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:42.750
- Dad!
- My daughter!

129
00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:47.083
- You are not sleeping.
- Good evening.

130
00:14:47.167 --> 00:14:49.333
Alright. let's go.

131
00:14:51.042 --> 00:14:52.562
- Good evening. daddy.
- Daddy welcome.

132
00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:54.250
- How are you?
- Fine.

133
00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:01.750
Good girl.

134
00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:12.958
David. pray for us.

135
00:15:15.417 --> 00:15:19.208
In the name of the Father. and of
the Son. and of the Holy Spirit.

136
00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:21.083
Father Lord...

137
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.833
Hello.

138
00:15:45.917 --> 00:15:49.708
Yes. Shotubo. Shotubo Bakare.

139
00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:52.083
Mr. Bakare. long time.

140
00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:55.958
DCP Bukar.
I need to see you urgently please.

141
00:15:56.042 --> 00:15:59.292
I'm on the way to Abuja.
I'm catching a flight now.

142
00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:00.458
Okay.

143
00:16:04.708 --> 00:16:07.208
He was finally released last night.

144
00:16:07.292 --> 00:16:09.583
in the middle of nowhere
on the way to Epe.

145
00:16:10.292 --> 00:16:13.125
The boy is a shadow of himself now.

146
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.000
Why didn’t you come to me earlier?

147
00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:18.292
It was the mother!

148
00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:22.542
My sister in-law.
she was scared to involve the police.

149
00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:26.250
Well. I have been on this case
for years now.

150
00:16:26.333 --> 00:16:27.708
The last time we got close to him.

151
00:16:27.792 --> 00:16:31.542
we got one of his boys who took us
to the body of a hostage.

152
00:16:32.542 --> 00:16:36.958
The poor victim had been buried for weeks.
yet he continued collecting ransom.

153
00:16:37.042 --> 00:16:38.083
Can you imagine?

154
00:16:38.167 --> 00:16:40.917
And no one has come forward to report.

155
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.708
See Bukar. you can’t imagine the threats.

156
00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:48.625
The guy knows a lot about my family.

157
00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:51.625
He even claims he has informants
within the police.

158
00:16:54.750 --> 00:17:01.208
DCP. with all due respect.
you know how corrupt the police is.

159
00:17:04.208 --> 00:17:07.667
That was why
I flew in to see you myself. okay?

160
00:17:10.583 --> 00:17:15.958
See. this is the number
he gave to the family to contact him on.

161
00:17:16.042 --> 00:17:18.125
I am sure he will have thrown
it away by now.

162
00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:20.417
but I just thought this might be helpful.

163
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.750
Do not worry. we have our ways.

164
00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:24.375
Bukar.

165
00:17:25.042 --> 00:17:26.042
See...

166
00:17:27.083 --> 00:17:29.292
My family has gone through so much.

167
00:17:30.042 --> 00:17:34.208
We have lost so much already
because of this mad man.

168
00:17:35.292 --> 00:17:38.333
You have to catch him. whatever it takes.

169
00:17:49.125 --> 00:17:50.125
Thirty.

170
00:17:51.083 --> 00:17:52.083
Wow!

171
00:17:53.042 --> 00:17:54.292
Foreign money.

172
00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:57.750
Thank you.

173
00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.042
Why are you thanking me? It is your money.

174
00:18:01.125 --> 00:18:04.583
When you appreciate someone
for what he has done. he will do more.

175
00:18:06.667 --> 00:18:12.250
Chairman! High five. you are great.

176
00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:13.208
That's right.

177
00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:14.292
But...

178
00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:19.042
If not for you in this town.
my brother. I would have died.

179
00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:20.375
Forget about it.

180
00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:23.542
The guy has come.

181
00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:43.333
Good afternoon. sir.

182
00:18:44.542 --> 00:18:46.750
- Ebuka.
- Yes. sir.

183
00:18:46.833 --> 00:18:49.000
- Sit down.
- Thank you. sir.

184
00:18:57.917 --> 00:19:04.417
So. I need you to transfer the money
tomorrow for the containers.

185
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.333
or else we lose the shipment.

186
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.625
That is no problem. it’s a normal thing.

187
00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:21.292
5.000 Dollars.

188
00:19:21.375 --> 00:19:25.000
Okay. I will pay it in installments.

189
00:19:25.583 --> 00:19:29.167
5.000 Dollars into your corporate account

190
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.667
and the other account each time...

191
00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:33.417
In five days.

192
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:38.167
so that will make everything.
plus the one in the other account...

193
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.542
Eighty five thousand Dollars.

194
00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:47.042
Okay.

195
00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:54.250
Your own.

196
00:19:56.583 --> 00:20:00.125
Chairman. this is too much.

197
00:20:03.042 --> 00:20:05.583
Alex said you have something to tell us.

198
00:20:12.417 --> 00:20:13.792
Talk.

199
00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:17.750
There is a woman that comes
to our branch very well.

200
00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:23.250
I'm not her account officer.
Jude is her account...

201
00:20:24.417 --> 00:20:31.083
Anyway. the woman's father just died
and she is the man's only child...

202
00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:33.042
and she already works for the company.

203
00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:36.917
so now that the man is dead
she has taken over the whole business.

204
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.042
They are the owners
of God's Protection Transit.

205
00:20:43.667 --> 00:20:45.250
You don't know them?

206
00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:49.000
They are the biggest transport company
in Nigeria.

207
00:20:49.083 --> 00:20:51.542
They make a lot of money.

208
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.750
The money might not be legit.

209
00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:10.750
My brother. Francis.
wants to learn this work.

210
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.250
It's only 15.000 Naira
per month for an apprenticeship.

211
00:21:16.042 --> 00:21:19.375
Okay. take. 10.000.

212
00:21:25.542 --> 00:21:28.833
And it seems like she knows a guy
that works in the government.

213
00:21:28.917 --> 00:21:30.625
because it did not take long after

214
00:21:30.708 --> 00:21:33.309
she took over. they gave her a contract
for two hundred and forty cars.

215
00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:36.167
She was at our branch two weeks
ago to collect the LC.

216
00:21:38.083 --> 00:21:40.625
And she has a child.

217
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.083
A little boy that goes to the office
with her sometimes.

218
00:21:52.167 --> 00:21:54.250
This is her house address.

219
00:22:00.542 --> 00:22:03.292
Chairman. I am telling you.
these people are loaded.

220
00:22:03.375 --> 00:22:06.583
You will need a truck
to carry the kind of money they have.

221
00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:11.542
But. please don't forget my cut.
You know. as your boy.

222
00:22:22.208 --> 00:22:23.583
What is that?

223
00:22:24.417 --> 00:22:26.208
You are looking for a case. right?

224
00:22:28.083 --> 00:22:29.375
A case has found you.

225
00:22:30.417 --> 00:22:32.167
Nice one! So...

226
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.083
- Morning. sir.
- Good morning.

227
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.458
Wale. what do you have for me?

228
00:22:43.542 --> 00:22:45.625
Sir. the device
has had 13 sim cards in it

229
00:22:45.708 --> 00:22:47.750
in the last four years since
it has been active.

230
00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:50.083
Each sim card has been
used to dial only one number.

231
00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:52.976
with the exception of one of the sim
cards which was used to dial two numbers

232
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.018
but we will get to that soon.

233
00:22:54.042 --> 00:22:56.442
- So who did he call?
- That’s where it gets interesting sir.

234
00:22:57.583 --> 00:23:00.375
With the data we have been able to
collect from the Telcos and banks.

235
00:23:00.458 --> 00:23:02.143
what they have in common
is they are all of significant means.

236
00:23:02.167 --> 00:23:04.375
HNIs. we are talking billions.

237
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.250
Really?

238
00:23:07.708 --> 00:23:11.583
They all live in affluent parts of Lagos
and they all own big businesses.

239
00:23:11.667 --> 00:23:13.500
Evidently these are his victims.

240
00:23:14.417 --> 00:23:17.377
Yes sir. but there is one exception.
the sim card used to dial two numbers.

241
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.542
The second number he dialed was
to a hotel in South Africa.

242
00:23:20.625 --> 00:23:21.792
Interesting.

243
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.875
We are waiting to hear back
from the hotel.

244
00:23:25.958 --> 00:23:28.583
- Forward me all the details you have.
- Right away sir.

245
00:23:33.042 --> 00:23:35.292
Hi. I’m Charles.

246
00:23:35.375 --> 00:23:38.167
I am also working on the case
so I will need those docu -

247
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.500
- Do you want something?
- Yes.

248
00:24:43.583 --> 00:24:46.208
- I will bring you something.
- Thank you.

249
00:24:51.125 --> 00:24:52.375
Two again.

250
00:25:13.083 --> 00:25:14.083
Leave her alone.

251
00:25:15.083 --> 00:25:17.333
Is it not who can pay
for it that will take it?

252
00:25:18.625 --> 00:25:19.750
It is my turn.

253
00:25:20.458 --> 00:25:22.500
Leave her. immediately!

254
00:25:26.708 --> 00:25:28.250
Leave me alone.

255
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.250
Turn off your headlights.
Are you mad?

256
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.167
Who is that?

257
00:25:50.167 --> 00:25:51.167
Eric!

258
00:25:54.458 --> 00:25:55.458
Eric!

259
00:25:56.542 --> 00:25:57.750
Eric please!

260
00:26:00.667 --> 00:26:04.083
Eric! Please stop! Leave him alone.

261
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.500
My love.

262
00:26:23.667 --> 00:26:24.667
Thank you.

263
00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:29.417
You see this thing that you have done...

264
00:26:30.458 --> 00:26:32.167
Nonso can never do it.

265
00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.583
I have told you.
do not talk about him like that.

266
00:26:35.667 --> 00:26:37.167
But am I lying?

267
00:26:38.208 --> 00:26:42.208
My dear. I did it because of you.

268
00:26:42.292 --> 00:26:45.458
Yes. but a husband that cannot take care
of his wife. is that one a husband?

269
00:27:22.292 --> 00:27:26.417
You are the father of my children.

270
00:27:36.125 --> 00:27:41.625
The only man that continues
to fight for me.

271
00:27:55.292 --> 00:27:56.500
My love.

272
00:28:14.167 --> 00:28:17.042
Boko haram caught
the attention of the world

273
00:28:17.125 --> 00:28:22.583
with the kidnapping
of 270 school girls in 2014.

274
00:28:23.417 --> 00:28:28.917
But perhaps. they earned the lowest ransom
per single hostage in Nigeria.

275
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.042
Next slide. please.

276
00:28:32.417 --> 00:28:35.500
At least 100 million dollars

277
00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:39.292
in kidnap ransom has been paid
in the country in the last ten years.

278
00:28:40.042 --> 00:28:43.958
With the following states
having the highest incidences.

279
00:28:44.042 --> 00:28:45.042
Next.

280
00:28:47.083 --> 00:28:50.542
These are some of the victims

281
00:28:50.625 --> 00:28:53.708
of the most ruthless and perhaps the
most organized kidnapper

282
00:28:53.792 --> 00:28:56.958
in the country in the last four
years alone.

283
00:28:57.042 --> 00:29:01.458
His minimum ransom per hostage.
one million dollars.

284
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:07.000
The level of organization. the planning
of the kidnappings. the money laundry.

285
00:29:07.083 --> 00:29:08.375
This is no petty criminal;

286
00:29:08.458 --> 00:29:12.083
this is an intelligent and
sophisticated mind.

287
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:20.000
Sir. you know my team is so small now.
we can’t be able to handle this alone.

288
00:29:21.458 --> 00:29:25.125
What do you want me to do. Bukar?
We simply don’t have the funds.

289
00:29:25.208 --> 00:29:27.667
Sir. I know I have made
mistakes in the past.

290
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.875
but that’s behind me now.

291
00:29:29.958 --> 00:29:34.583
Bukar. you don’t seem to understand...

292
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.667
my hands are tied.

293
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.167
Ten months into the financial year.

294
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:44.375
they have only just disbursed 40 percent
of our total budget.

295
00:29:46.292 --> 00:29:50.000
For the service commission to pay salary.
it’s a problem.

296
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.625
300.000 police officers on the force.

297
00:29:54.708 --> 00:29:59.583
Yet our total salary is less than that
of a 100 men at the national assembly.

298
00:29:59.667 --> 00:30:02.458
Yet they can be able
to disburse that one in full.

299
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.500
Now you see what I mean.

300
00:30:09.667 --> 00:30:11.833
Let's just see what I can do.

301
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.542
Thank you sir.

302
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:45.208
Good morning. we would like
to speak with Mr. Ikeji. please.

303
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.333
We will need you to follow
us to the station.

304
00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:56.625
We have some questions in relation
to an ongoing investigation.

305
00:30:58.875 --> 00:31:00.684
I really don’t know what
you are talking about.

306
00:31:00.708 --> 00:31:03.542
I don’t know how our number got on
this phone you are talking about.

307
00:31:03.625 --> 00:31:04.945
it must have been a wrong number.

308
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.250
Look. don’t put me in trouble.

309
00:31:10.292 --> 00:31:14.083
We don’t have anything to say.
Can we go now?

310
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.500
Move and let us go home. do I have time
for the rubbish they are doing here?

311
00:31:18.583 --> 00:31:20.292
Useless people!

312
00:31:20.375 --> 00:31:22.000
Police indeed!

313
00:31:22.083 --> 00:31:23.563
It shall not be well with the police!

314
00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:27.500
Bose. I'm coming. I forgot my phone.

315
00:31:29.583 --> 00:31:30.583
Bukar.

316
00:31:32.083 --> 00:31:33.625
My nephew wants to talk.

317
00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:35.625
the boy is very angry
what happened to him.

318
00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:36.976
but the mother will not let him talk.

319
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.292
I noticed.

320
00:31:38.375 --> 00:31:41.625
So we have to arrange.
nowhere near the police. okay?

321
00:31:41.708 --> 00:31:44.500
- Only you. just you.
- When can we do this?

322
00:31:44.583 --> 00:31:48.667
The boy is leaving for the US tomorrow.
so it has to be tonight.

323
00:31:51.583 --> 00:31:54.917
So we walked for what seem
like hours and hours

324
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.583
and eventually they
led me into a house.

325
00:31:57.667 --> 00:31:59.417
I mean I was blindfolded the entire time.

326
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:04.000
the only time I wasn’t blindfolded
was when I had to use the toilet.

327
00:32:04.083 --> 00:32:05.500
For three months?

328
00:32:05.583 --> 00:32:08.417
Yeah. fucking bastards.

329
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.500
Sorry. uncle.

330
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.667
So how much was paid in ransom?

331
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:18.042
We paid one million dollars.
Bukar. one million dollars!

332
00:32:18.125 --> 00:32:22.917
Technically. we paid 999.960 dollars.

333
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.958
I mean. they gave me 15.000 Naira

334
00:32:25.042 --> 00:32:27.184
when they dropped me
in the middle of Epe to find a taxi.

335
00:32:27.208 --> 00:32:29.583
He was even generous enough to do that.

336
00:32:32.292 --> 00:32:33.917
I need to record this conversation.

337
00:32:35.083 --> 00:32:36.458
We need every detail.

338
00:32:36.542 --> 00:32:39.208
Everything you saw. everything you heard.

339
00:32:39.292 --> 00:32:42.542
Any and everything could
be the key that unlocks it for us.

340
00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.958
What the hell.
I'm leaving tomorrow anyway. so...

341
00:32:51.042 --> 00:32:52.042
Thank you.

342
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:11.625
So they have paid one 100.000 dollars.
and we have released the boy.

343
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.208
Francis. 5.000.

344
00:33:16.292 --> 00:33:18.000
- Uche. 10.000.
- Boss.

345
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.500
Sunday. 10.000.

346
00:33:20.583 --> 00:33:23.333
My second-in-command. 15.000.

347
00:33:24.125 --> 00:33:28.167
Even the boys at the house
will share 25.000.

348
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.500
Count it. I don't want to hear excuses.

349
00:33:31.583 --> 00:33:34.125
- Iron root.
- Is it complete?

350
00:33:34.208 --> 00:33:35.500
It is complete.

351
00:33:43.417 --> 00:33:46.208
Eric. please...

352
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.292
This money that you have shared...

353
00:33:49.833 --> 00:33:56.083
I want to use it to pay off my debts.

354
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.667
That will be difficult.

355
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:00.333
What?

356
00:34:00.417 --> 00:34:06.000
Because I also have a lot of things
that I have to take care of.

357
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.667
Eric. please.

358
00:34:11.625 --> 00:34:16.125
My wife is sick.

359
00:34:16.208 --> 00:34:21.167
They are asking for one million Naira.

360
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:25.333
And that's aside the two million
I am owing people already.

361
00:34:25.417 --> 00:34:30.458
If there is any way you can help me.

362
00:34:30.542 --> 00:34:31.583
Please.

363
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.083
If you can't take care of your family.
you are not a man.

364
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.250
But...

365
00:34:41.542 --> 00:34:43.500

366
00:34:43.583 --> 00:34:44.958

00:34:45.042 --> 00:34:46.309
But I will take it from the next pay.

368
00:34:46.333 --> 00:34:50.500
I am lending you the money.
I will take it from the next job's pay.

369
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:55.292
- Okay?
- Okay. God bless you.

370
00:34:55.375 --> 00:34:58.083

371
00:34:58.167 --> 00:34:59.542

Mister. leave the road!

381
00:37:38.167 --> 00:37:42.167
Some idiot bike man just hit us
and I just had the body work done.

382
00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:43.250
Are you blind?

383
00:37:45.542 --> 00:37:48.458
- What is your problem?
- Fuck!

384
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.250

386
00:37:59.333 --> 00:38:01.583

Mister. lie down! I said lie down!

389
00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:15.417
Don't try it.

390
00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:25.667
Open the door.

391
00:38:27.625 --> 00:38:28.625

This thing that is good for your body.
It's all natural herbs.

400
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.750
Keep on deceiving yourself.

401
00:39:46.542 --> 00:39:47.542
Come...

402
00:39:48.417 --> 00:39:50.667
They are not looking for your type there.

403
00:39:51.417 --> 00:39:54.917
In this hot weather.
you decided to tie a bandana.

404
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.625
Come off it!

405
00:39:56.708 --> 00:39:57.708

One day. very soon. I will leave all of
you in this shit hole you call a country.

407
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.375
Oh please!

408
00:40:04.458 --> 00:40:07.058
You have not seen a passport before
and you want to travel abroad.

409
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.958
Look at this one.

410
00:40:09.042 --> 00:40:11.667
- Continue strangling yourself.
- What do you know?

411
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.542
I am who you are trying to be.
Let me tell you some...

412
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:16.917
Guy. forget about that.

413
00:40:17.667 --> 00:40:18.667
Hello.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.667
Turn on the inner light.

419
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.750
It's not working.
I am just going to repair it.

420
00:40:58.417 --> 00:41:02.000

- Nothing sir. I have a cough.

421
00:41:07.083 --> 00:41:09.417

427
00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:35.750
Idiot.

428
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:51.458
- Boss. leave her.
- Alright! Put your head down!

429
00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:52.542
Watch her head.

430
00:41:56.417 --> 00:41:57.417
Watch her head.

431
00:42:13.292 --> 00:42:15.458
This woman is too slow.

432
00:42:15.542 --> 00:42:17.125
Move.

433
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.583
Move!

434
00:42:20.667 --> 00:42:22.250
Guy. why did you do that?

435
00:42:22.333 --> 00:42:23.167
I don't like this.

436
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.458
Take it easy.

437
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.643
We haven't gotten to our destination yet.
she is not tired yet.

438
00:42:26.667 --> 00:42:28.583
She still has enough energy.
Get up.

439
00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:31.375
Guy. take it easy.

440
00:42:32.667 --> 00:42:34.500
I'm even pitying her.

441
00:42:45.417 --> 00:42:46.708
Easy.

442
00:42:48.125 --> 00:42:49.292
Easy.

443
00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.500
Easy.

444
00:43:01.292 --> 00:43:03.250
Close your eyes.

445
00:43:09.917 --> 00:43:12.333
Your hands like this. Pray!

446
00:43:16.292 --> 00:43:18.333
Keep your legs still.
You will hurt yourself.

447
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.250
Move.

448
00:43:42.042 --> 00:43:43.667
Sorry. okay?

449
00:43:46.417 --> 00:43:50.250
Do you want some water?

450
00:43:50.333 --> 00:43:51.417
Okay.

451
00:43:57.417 --> 00:43:59.625
Please. give it to her.

452
00:43:59.708 --> 00:44:01.292
Open your mouth.

453
00:44:04.583 --> 00:44:05.750
Sorry.

454
00:44:16.292 --> 00:44:19.083
Don't worry. okay?

455
00:44:19.167 --> 00:44:24.875
They are cooking for you.
rice and chicken stew.

456
00:44:24.958 --> 00:44:27.958
Did you hear me?

457
00:44:28.042 --> 00:44:32.500
Alright. what is your husband's number?

458
00:44:40.625 --> 00:44:43.625
This woman.

459
00:44:49.208 --> 00:44:53.250
There are only two ways
you are going to leave this place.

460
00:44:54.708 --> 00:44:58.042
If your husband pays me my money.

461
00:44:58.125 --> 00:44:59.458
all of us are happy.

462
00:44:59.542 --> 00:45:01.662
If your husband pays me my money.
all of us are happy.

463
00:45:02.625 --> 00:45:04.042
Check this out.

464
00:45:06.292 --> 00:45:11.000
I will even buy you that Chinese food
that you always buy

465
00:45:11.083 --> 00:45:15.333
anytime you are going
to your boyfriend’s house.

466
00:45:15.417 --> 00:45:19.625
Of course!
I know you are seeing someone else.

467
00:45:19.708 --> 00:45:25.292
What is my business?
Nobody is a saint. It is not my business.

468
00:45:34.208 --> 00:45:36.708
But if your husband doesn't pay...

469
00:45:38.083 --> 00:45:43.083
It's your son. Samuel. that I pity.

470
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.500
Samuel.

471
00:45:57.625 --> 00:46:02.542
So. what is your husband's number?

472
00:46:08.292 --> 00:46:10.542
- Welcome. sir.
- Thank you.

473
00:46:10.625 --> 00:46:12.125
Is madam not upstairs?

474
00:46:12.208 --> 00:46:14.888
I have been trying to reach her but
her number is not going through.

475
00:46:15.125 --> 00:46:16.125
No. sir.

476
00:46:17.292 --> 00:46:18.167
Sir...

477
00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:19.643
What do you have to say? Speak it out!

478
00:46:19.667 --> 00:46:20.708
Her driver is here.

479
00:46:20.792 --> 00:46:24.250
he is in the boy's quarters.
he has been waiting for you sir.

480
00:46:29.667 --> 00:46:30.958
What the heck is this?

481
00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:36.542
<i>Mr. Madueke.</i>

482
00:46:36.625 --> 00:46:37.708
Yes. who is this?

483
00:46:38.583 --> 00:46:40.417
I have your wife.

484
00:46:41.417 --> 00:46:44.417
Please tell me this is a joke.

485
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:49.833
Wow. so you think this is a joke?

486
00:46:49.917 --> 00:46:54.208
This is not a joke.
Have you seen the picture?

487
00:47:06.333 --> 00:47:09.542
Yes. but...

488
00:47:09.625 --> 00:47:11.042
<i>No buts.</i>

489
00:47:11.708 --> 00:47:13.417
If you want to see her again.

490
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.292
You are going to pay me
one million American Dollars.

491
00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:17.250
Watch her head.

492
00:47:17.333 --> 00:47:23.042
One million...

493
00:47:28.125 --> 00:47:32.625
My brother.
we don't have that kind of money.

494
00:47:32.708 --> 00:47:37.333
My brother. what are you saying?

495
00:47:38.042 --> 00:47:39.542
Now you are lying to me.

496
00:47:39.625 --> 00:47:41.333
I'm not.

497
00:47:42.333 --> 00:47:44.750
Let me tell you something.

498
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:48.417
There's this joke:

499
00:47:49.083 --> 00:47:53.292
a British. an American and a Nigerian.

500
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:56.458
All of them were billionaires.

501
00:47:56.542 --> 00:47:59.250
The three of them died and went to hell.

502
00:48:00.583 --> 00:48:01.958
When they got there.

503
00:48:02.042 --> 00:48:05.667
the British man took the phone

504
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.670
from the devil to call his family
for one minute.

505
00:48:09.167 --> 00:48:11.417
After the call.

506
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.958
the devil told him his bill
was 5 million Dollars.

507
00:48:16.583 --> 00:48:21.083
The American took the phone
and called for two minutes.

508
00:48:22.292 --> 00:48:26.083
The devil told him his bill
was ten million Dollars.

509
00:48:28.333 --> 00:48:31.458
Then the Nigerian took the phone.

510
00:48:33.167 --> 00:48:36.333
The Nigerian talked
on the phone for five hours.

511
00:48:38.042 --> 00:48:39.792
He asked the devil for the bill.

512
00:48:40.292 --> 00:48:42.333
The devil said it was five Dollars.

513
00:48:46.083 --> 00:48:49.417
People asked how come?

514
00:48:51.167 --> 00:48:55.833
Then the devil said it was a local call.

515
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:07.125
My brother.
you know we are already in hell.

516
00:49:07.208 --> 00:49:11.167
My brother. this is Nigeria.
All of us are thieves.

517
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.667
You and your wife have joined
your senator friends to steal. right?

518
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:20.417
No problem. All of you are sharing
the nation's profits.

519
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:25.375
Since you don't want to share it with us.
we will take it by force!

520
00:49:27.542 --> 00:49:29.750
After all. it's our money.

521
00:49:30.375 --> 00:49:34.750
I only want my compensation. That's all.

522
00:49:43.042 --> 00:49:50.000
Anybody that wants
to betray you will die before their time!

523
00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:01.500
- Do you like it?
- I like it. I love you.

524
00:50:08.708 --> 00:50:10.125
Yes. hello.

525
00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:12.375
Honey.
you need to see where I am right now!

526
00:50:12.458 --> 00:50:16.250
The furniture comes with the house.

527
00:50:16.333 --> 00:50:21.167
Baby. you need to see this place
for yourself. It's beautiful!

528
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:24.125
It's okay. Give Michael the phone.

529
00:50:24.208 --> 00:50:27.125
Okay. he wants to talk to you.

530
00:50:27.208 --> 00:50:30.375
Hello sir. When are you coming to Accra?

531
00:50:30.958 --> 00:50:33.417
Madam has already
bought the properties.

532
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.167
No problem.

533
00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:39.292
Even the owners of the property
are ready to move today.

534
00:50:39.375 --> 00:50:42.417
I will make a transfer. okay?

535
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.458
Good. have you sorted out the papers?

536
00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:48.667
Yes. sir. My company will pay
for the property

537
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:50.059
and we will have it in your son's name.

538
00:50:50.083 --> 00:50:51.375
- Of course.
- That is it.

539
00:50:51.458 --> 00:50:52.542
Okay. thank you sir.

540
00:50:53.333 --> 00:50:54.333

Yes. Ali. make the transfer.

543
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:22.500
The regular.

544
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.750
Your food.

545
00:51:39.417 --> 00:51:40.667
Eat.

546
00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:49.333
Okay.
our spaghetti is not good enough for you.

547
00:51:49.417 --> 00:51:53.625
You only eat special dishes at Ikoyi.

548
00:51:53.708 --> 00:51:55.250
I'm just not hungry.

549
00:51:57.292 --> 00:51:59.833
I'm just not hungry.

550
00:52:02.167 --> 00:52:05.583
You better eat.

551
00:52:05.667 --> 00:52:08.167
Your husband has forgotten you.

552
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:11.417
If you die of hunger here.
he will take all your money.

553
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.667
Oh just shut up.

554
00:52:26.083 --> 00:52:27.458
Jeez.

555
00:52:28.875 --> 00:52:32.583
Do you think you are talking
to your husband that cannot control you?

556
00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.458
Do you. Doris?

557
00:52:35.458 --> 00:52:37.458
Mind yourself.

558
00:52:38.417 --> 00:52:39.875
Ask around about me.

559
00:52:46.833 --> 00:52:48.792
If you like. don't eat.

560
00:52:52.458 --> 00:52:53.583
Please...

561
00:52:58.625 --> 00:53:01.500
Can I get a bucket of water?

562
00:53:04.458 --> 00:53:09.708
And a sanitary pad.
or even a toilet roll. please.

563
00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:16.125
No wonder!
So you have been the one smelling.

564
00:53:19.458 --> 00:53:25.583
Sister Caro.
come and see your fellow woman.

565
00:53:38.542 --> 00:53:40.708
Ifeanyi. where is my money?

566
00:53:40.792 --> 00:53:43.417
Yes. I have it now.

567
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:47.625
We have 350.000 dollars.
we'll have more soon.

568
00:53:47.708 --> 00:53:48.708
Good.

569
00:53:49.792 --> 00:53:54.375
Now. go to your car and open the door.

570
00:53:55.583 --> 00:54:00.125
Now. remove the interior door cover.

571
00:54:00.208 --> 00:54:03.750
Put the money there and close it.

572
00:54:03.833 --> 00:54:05.375
Now. listen.

573
00:54:06.375 --> 00:54:12.875
You will drive to Onitsha.
When you get there. call me.

574
00:54:12.958 --> 00:54:15.333
Do not let us look for you.

575
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.625
Hello.

576
00:54:34.708 --> 00:54:41.000
Yes. keep coming. Straight on.

577
00:54:43.375 --> 00:54:48.417
Yes. I am here now.

578
00:54:49.042 --> 00:54:50.458
Walk forward a bit.

579
00:54:51.042 --> 00:54:55.875
I'm at the bush part.
I'm trying to locate where to drop it off.

580
00:54:55.958 --> 00:55:01.958
You will see a tree. with a red cloth.

581
00:55:02.625 --> 00:55:04.292
Okay. I have seen it.

582
00:55:04.375 --> 00:55:07.750
Yes. drop it there.

583
00:55:09.167 --> 00:55:10.750
I have dropped it.

584
00:55:19.833 --> 00:55:22.667
Alright. time to have your bath.

585
00:55:31.333 --> 00:55:32.500
Thank you.

586
00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:38.833
Quickly.

587
00:56:16.458 --> 00:56:17.458
Hello...

588
00:56:18.125 --> 00:56:21.292
Hello. Yes. I have sent the money.

589
00:56:23.583 --> 00:56:24.583
No.

590
00:56:26.667 --> 00:56:27.833
You can't say that.

591
00:56:28.708 --> 00:56:30.292
After I already gave you 500.000.

592
00:56:30.792 --> 00:56:33.500
Is 500.000 a small amount?
Where am I supposed to get this one from?

593
00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:38.958
I'm not saying you should return my money.

594
00:56:39.042 --> 00:56:41.750
What I am saying is that I don't have
that kind of money!

595
00:56:44.792 --> 00:56:45.792
I'm coming.

596
00:56:46.583 --> 00:56:49.375
Guy. I don't have that kind of money.

597
00:56:49.458 --> 00:56:53.083
Okay. I'll call you back.
I'll call you back this night.

598
00:56:57.667 --> 00:57:00.833
Yes. open!

599
00:57:04.458 --> 00:57:05.583
Come forward!

600
00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:09.167
Forward.

601
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:21.958
Is everything okay?

602
00:57:24.333 --> 00:57:26.125
How is that any of your business?

603
00:57:26.208 --> 00:57:30.875
Sorry. I thought it was a family member
or something.

604
00:57:30.958 --> 00:57:32.333
Sorry.

605
00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:39.208
I want to ask a question.

606
00:57:39.292 --> 00:57:41.708
Do you know how much
he is collecting from my husband?

607
00:57:44.667 --> 00:57:45.667
You mean my boss?

608
00:57:45.708 --> 00:57:46.833
Yes.

609
00:57:48.833 --> 00:57:50.625
That is between you both.

610
00:57:50.708 --> 00:57:54.583
What is my business?
As long as my boss gives me my cut.

611
00:57:54.667 --> 00:57:58.667
What if you call my husband.

612
00:57:59.625 --> 00:58:03.083
and I tell him to send you some money?

613
00:58:06.833 --> 00:58:10.042
About five million Naira.

614
00:58:11.167 --> 00:58:12.500
What do you think?

615
00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:26.750
Look at Doris. Look at this manipulator.

616
00:58:26.833 --> 00:58:29.208
Doris. do you want my boss to kill me?

617
00:58:30.833 --> 00:58:33.583
How would he find out?

618
00:58:33.667 --> 00:58:36.292
Is the money for free? Bring your hand!

619
00:58:43.833 --> 00:58:48.417
Honey. thank you for this church donation.

620
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:52.833
The priest has been disturbing
me for six months now.

621
00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:58.750
I don't know how any
of this is your business.

622
00:58:59.333 --> 00:59:02.417
They want to build a sunday school
for the children.

623
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:03.500
Is it your business?

624
00:59:04.833 --> 00:59:06.542
The children like this church

625
00:59:06.625 --> 00:59:09.667
and Adanna is singing
in the children's choir today.

626
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:12.708
My daughter. really?

627
00:59:14.625 --> 00:59:19.583
Chukwudi. I don't have any friends.

628
00:59:20.583 --> 00:59:27.250
The chidren's friends from school.
my people from home. nobody visits us.

629
00:59:28.333 --> 00:59:35.583
At least. let us connect with people
from the church from time to time. please.

630
00:59:35.667 --> 00:59:40.708
It's enough. I have heard.

631
00:59:40.792 --> 00:59:42.500
Thank you.
Come back early.

632
00:59:43.667 --> 00:59:45.667
Don't go anywhere else.

633
00:59:46.208 --> 00:59:47.417
Come straight home.

634
00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.250
Okay. I have heard.

635
01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:10.500
We just wasted two weeks here.
Interview upon interview. yet nothing!

636
01:01:11.375 --> 01:01:15.333
We've combed the whole area. it's like
searching for a needle in a haystack.

637
01:01:16.125 --> 01:01:19.083
Hello. Wale. Tell me you have good news.

638
01:01:19.167 --> 01:01:21.143
Yes sir. we have heard back
from the hotel in South Africa.

639
01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:22.167
And?

640
01:01:22.208 --> 01:01:25.750
There was a Nigerian staying in the hotel
during that period. he's from Imo state.

641
01:01:25.833 --> 01:01:28.875
From the exact same village
the victim say the chairman is from.

642
01:01:28.958 --> 01:01:29.875
Really?

643
01:01:29.958 --> 01:01:32.375
Yes. sir. The SA police have
not been very cooperative

644
01:01:32.458 --> 01:01:34.750
and the hotel has refused to send
us his scanned passport.

645
01:01:34.833 --> 01:01:38.125
We managed to get them to send
us the form he filled though.

646
01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:40.875
his credit card is registered
to a UK address.

647
01:01:40.958 --> 01:01:45.417
Great! Forward me the details.
I will get in touch with Scotland Yard.

648
01:02:20.125 --> 01:02:21.125
Meshach!

649
01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:29.917
Meshach!

650
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.208
Meshach! Where are you?

651
01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:29.250
I'm coming.

652
01:04:03.458 --> 01:04:05.250
Hello. Blessing.

653
01:04:05.333 --> 01:04:08.167
My brother. good evening.

654
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:09.500
Good evening.

655
01:04:09.583 --> 01:04:11.250
How is everything?

656
01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:15.167
My brother. I'm fine. But...

657
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:17.625
Dad is sick.

658
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.750
How much do you need?

659
01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:25.625
My brother. it is bad. He is dying.

660
01:04:25.708 --> 01:04:27.875
If he dies. we'll bury him.

661
01:04:28.583 --> 01:04:29.583
No!

662
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.458
How can you say a thing like that?

663
01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:38.417
Dad has not seen you
for almost nineteen years.

664
01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.500
Listen. Ngozi.

665
01:04:42.083 --> 01:04:47.708
Since morning.
I have been working. I am very tired.

666
01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:50.083
So do you want the money or not?

667
01:04:50.167 --> 01:04:56.333
Money is not everything.
family is everything.

668
01:04:56.417 --> 01:05:00.417
I have been in Lagos for seven years now

669
01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:03.917
but I have not been to your house.

670
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.833
Our children meet in a hotel.
is that a good life?

671
01:05:09.917 --> 01:05:14.625
A man that cannot take care
of his family. is he really a man?

672
01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:23.750
Dad is just poor.
He did not kill anyone.

673
01:05:23.833 --> 01:05:26.250
Poverty is not a sin.

674
01:05:26.333 --> 01:05:27.625
Laziness is.

675
01:05:27.708 --> 01:05:28.875
Look. Ngozi.

676
01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:36.250
I can't talk for long.
when you need the money call me.

677
01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:00.542
How many times have I warned
you not to take pictures of me?

678
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:02.250
Never!

679
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:18.333
Quiet please.

680
01:06:22.292 --> 01:06:24.667
Come open the gate.

681
01:06:31.333 --> 01:06:33.083
Have you said thank you to daddy?

682
01:06:33.167 --> 01:06:35.000
Thank you daddy.

683
01:06:35.083 --> 01:06:37.250
It's okay.

684
01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:47.083
How will I eat now?

685
01:06:48.167 --> 01:06:50.833
You have to find a way.
beause I am not moving.

686
01:06:53.333 --> 01:06:57.250
Move so I can eat.

687
01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:01.250
I have missed you.

688
01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:03.708
Really?

689
01:07:08.417 --> 01:07:10.375
You are so lovely.

690
01:07:12.833 --> 01:07:17.417
Wait! I am begging you.

691
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.708
I need to travel. there's nothing
left for me in this country.

692
01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:27.875
I have sold everything.
there's nothing left!

693
01:07:29.875 --> 01:07:34.667
Travelling to Italy is my last hope.
please!

694
01:07:38.792 --> 01:07:43.625
Wait. give me one week.

695
01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:51.583
Caro! Where is that woman's food
so I can give it to her to eat.

696
01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:54.042
- Why?
- Let me give her the food to eat.

697
01:07:54.125 --> 01:07:55.559
Don't worry about it.
I'll give it to her myself.

698
01:07:55.583 --> 01:07:57.000
Don't you worry. Caro. where is it?

699
01:07:57.083 --> 01:07:59.167
Why are you angry?
I said I will give it to her!

700
01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:00.333
Look at this guy!

701
01:08:00.417 --> 01:08:02.292
Why must you be so aggressive?

702
01:08:02.375 --> 01:08:05.417
They have banned you from going
inside to give her food.

703
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.833
You're always trying to prove
that you're strong.

704
01:08:15.083 --> 01:08:18.417
Madam Doris. I'm ready.

705
01:08:20.833 --> 01:08:22.333
What's the plan?

706
01:08:26.542 --> 01:08:28.917
I'm sorry. I don’t have any better news.

707
01:08:30.333 --> 01:08:31.750
Hello. can you hear me?

708
01:08:31.833 --> 01:08:34.250
Yes. continue. we can hear you.

709
01:08:34.333 --> 01:08:37.625
He doesn’t appear
to have any ties to Nigeria.

710
01:08:37.708 --> 01:08:39.583
At least not for the last ten years.

711
01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:43.958
What about his financial records?
His family?

712
01:08:44.042 --> 01:08:48.625
He's been married for 15 years
and they have three children.

713
01:08:48.708 --> 01:08:50.875
His financial records check out.

714
01:08:50.958 --> 01:08:56.417
No inflows from any unexplained sources.
he's only had two jobs since

715
01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:00.250
he moved here to a University in 1999
and as I said before.

716
01:09:00.333 --> 01:09:02.958
the South Africa trip was just for work.

717
01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:07.250
I will be honest.
I don’t think this is your guy.

718
01:09:07.333 --> 01:09:08.708
Come on!

719
01:09:09.583 --> 01:09:10.833
Thanks. Harry.

720
01:09:13.458 --> 01:09:14.542
Calm down.

721
01:09:16.333 --> 01:09:18.583
We should be on a plane
to London right now!

722
01:09:18.667 --> 01:09:23.833
It is not every clue you must follow.
this isn’t enough. you need to focus.

723
01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:25.333
So is it a coincidence

724
01:09:25.417 --> 01:09:28.792
that a man from the same village
was in the same hotel that he called?

725
01:09:28.875 --> 01:09:29.875
Come on now!

726
01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:33.667
Young man. do you think you want
to catch this bastard more than me?

727
01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.500
Get out of my office.

728
01:09:37.792 --> 01:09:40.625
- Sir...
- I said get out of my office!

729
01:09:48.458 --> 01:09:51.417
- Calm down!
- Stop telling me to calm down!

730
01:09:53.167 --> 01:09:54.500
Okay. good night.

731
01:09:56.708 --> 01:10:00.000
We're just here. wasting time!
Come on!

732
01:10:00.083 --> 01:10:03.042
Calm down. just hold on.
let’s go and talk.

733
01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:04.167
Let's go.

734
01:10:15.375 --> 01:10:19.417
He is just wasting time.
and not getting anywhere.

735
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:24.375
First. he took those people
to the police station.

736
01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:25.667
of course they won’t talk.

737
01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:31.583
We went to Lagos. walking around.
And still. nothing!

738
01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:34.667
Now. this London.

739
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:36.375
He is just being cautious.

740
01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:41.208
Oh please!
This is more than just being cautious.

741
01:10:41.792 --> 01:10:45.375
Charles.
there are things that you do not know.

742
01:10:45.458 --> 01:10:46.958
Things like what?

743
01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:51.500
Look. I am tired of everyone telling
me nonsense! What don't I know?

744
01:10:52.167 --> 01:10:55.042
Look. any wrong move now.

745
01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:58.167
and he will be sent to one obscure state
where nothing is happening

746
01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.333
and his career will be in the toilet.

747
01:11:00.417 --> 01:11:04.917
Then maybe they should send him there.
because he has lost it!

748
01:11:05.667 --> 01:11:09.333
After the man basically built
the IRT from scratch.

749
01:11:09.417 --> 01:11:11.667
he made just one mistake.

750
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:15.875
And the people who already resented
how fast he was rising joined forces

751
01:11:15.958 --> 01:11:17.958
to take him down.

752
01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:21.833
That wasn't a small mistake.

753
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:25.125
So. you know?

754
01:11:25.792 --> 01:11:28.500
Who in the Police Force
hasn't heard of Red Wednesday?

755
01:11:29.542 --> 01:11:31.667
He lost almost his whole team
in a shootout

756
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:33.833
because of a stupid. arrogant decision.

757
01:11:37.792 --> 01:11:41.333
It's easy for you to judge now.
but you weren't there.

758
01:11:41.417 --> 01:11:43.167
And I really don't care!

759
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:44.750
I don't think you understand.

760
01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:48.042
I came to the Police Force
with an open mind.

761
01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:50.042
to learn from the great Bukar.

762
01:11:51.042 --> 01:11:54.083
But. I can see it's all past glory.

763
01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:12.333
Do you want some?

764
01:12:13.292 --> 01:12:14.292
Come.

765
01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:17.500
Good.

766
01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:27.708
That's enough.

767
01:12:29.667 --> 01:12:30.917
Do you like it?

768
01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:38.000
Don't tell your mum
that I gave you palm wine.

769
01:12:38.083 --> 01:12:39.417
Never.

770
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.125
Like father. like son.

771
01:12:41.208 --> 01:12:42.208
Go to bed.

772
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.500
Daddy.

773
01:12:48.167 --> 01:12:49.167
Yes?

774
01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:52.417
I'm sorry for taking a picture of you.

775
01:12:54.792 --> 01:12:58.458
I didn't know. I was just...

776
01:12:58.542 --> 01:13:01.083
It's okay.

777
01:13:11.167 --> 01:13:12.167
David.

778
01:13:14.792 --> 01:13:16.792
You are now a man.

779
01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:21.500
In this world. people are very wicked.

780
01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:26.792
You cannot trust anybody.

781
01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:42.542
Madam Doris.

782
01:13:42.625 --> 01:13:44.708
your husband has paid.

783
01:13:45.583 --> 01:13:47.875
Now listen to me very carefully.

784
01:13:47.958 --> 01:13:52.167
I will open these padlocks
and open the backdoor.

785
01:13:52.833 --> 01:13:56.083
Anything that happens after is up to you.

786
01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.042
Listen.

787
01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:04.250
If I catch you running.

788
01:14:04.958 --> 01:14:07.958
I will cock my gun and shoot you.

789
01:14:08.917 --> 01:14:11.750
- Do you understand?
- Yes. it's okay. I understand.

790
01:14:11.833 --> 01:14:16.333
Just help me with these padlocks
and the door. Leave the rest to me.

791
01:14:18.625 --> 01:14:19.708
Safe journey.

792
01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.708
- Honey.
- Yes?

793
01:14:33.667 --> 01:14:35.083
Won't you sleep?

794
01:14:35.667 --> 01:14:36.833
Leave me alone.

795
01:14:39.333 --> 01:14:41.708
Okay. goodnight.

796
01:14:41.792 --> 01:14:42.958
Okay.

797
01:14:48.708 --> 01:14:50.148
<i>Fifteen of the girls from the kidnap</i>

798
01:14:50.208 --> 01:14:52.708
<i>which occurred a month ago
have been found.</i>

799
01:14:52.792 --> 01:14:54.333
<i>The girls were said to have escaped</i>

800
01:14:54.417 --> 01:14:57.042
<i>while they were being transported
to another state.</i>

801
01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:59.208
<i>- The minister of information has...</i>
- Amateurs.

802
01:17:21.458 --> 01:17:22.458
Who are you?

803
01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:24.458
I'm looking for someone.

804
01:17:26.292 --> 01:17:29.625
Shach. come over here.

805
01:17:38.167 --> 01:17:40.667
Fuck! Who did this?

806
01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:41.750
My brother...

807
01:17:42.417 --> 01:17:44.250
- I don't like this!
- Get out!

808
01:17:44.333 --> 01:17:46.125
- I don't like this!
- Get out!

809
01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:47.083
You're the one that
that let that woman go!

810
01:17:47.167 --> 01:17:48.333
Look at this guy!

811
01:17:48.417 --> 01:17:51.178
- You're the one that let her go!
- Are you all listening to this boy?

812
01:17:52.375 --> 01:17:55.375
Why did you let her go?
You were fucking her. right?

813
01:17:55.458 --> 01:17:57.250
Look at this guy!

814
01:17:57.333 --> 01:17:58.750
I will shoot you!

815
01:17:58.833 --> 01:18:00.542
You can't do anything!

816
01:18:01.792 --> 01:18:03.000
Are the both of you mad?

817
01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.333
Stop this nonsense!

818
01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:12.708
- Meshach.
- Sir.

819
01:18:12.792 --> 01:18:14.667
Go out and watch the area.

820
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:17.333
Spark. Bring the bus.

821
01:18:17.417 --> 01:18:19.417
You all think I'm playing. right?

822
01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:22.417
Let me just not see that woman
in this house tonight.

823
01:18:38.542 --> 01:18:40.333
-Hello.<i>-Boss.</i>

824
01:18:40.417 --> 01:18:42.208
Chukwuka. what is it?

825
01:18:43.167 --> 01:18:46.000
<i>It's the lady. she has escaped.</i>

826
01:18:47.667 --> 01:18:48.708
What?

827
01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:51.333
How did that happen?

828
01:18:52.333 --> 01:18:55.083
Boss. I don't even know.

829
01:18:55.167 --> 01:18:58.625
We've searched for her everywhere.
we can't find her!

830
01:19:03.417 --> 01:19:05.250
Okay. listen to me.

831
01:19:05.333 --> 01:19:08.458
Pack up everything that can be used
to trace you guys.

832
01:19:09.375 --> 01:19:10.495
What about the other person?

833
01:19:12.542 --> 01:19:13.792
Kill him.

834
01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:16.250
Okay.

835
01:19:17.167 --> 01:19:22.625
Take all the sim cards and burn them.
including yours.

836
01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.500
Yes. sir.

837
01:19:29.375 --> 01:19:31.750
Pack up everything. we're leaving.

838
01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:32.833
Okay. sir.

839
01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:16.250
Bag him.

840
01:20:30.042 --> 01:20:31.042
<i>Hello.</i>

841
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:33.292
<i>Amadi. what's up?</i>

842
01:20:33.375 --> 01:20:37.083
Nothing much. I'm at the crime scene.

843
01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:40.250
-Are you in Isolo?<i>-Of course.</i>

844
01:20:40.333 --> 01:20:41.934
Is there anything there
that can link to me?

845
01:20:41.958 --> 01:20:44.875
No. nothing like that.

846
01:20:44.958 --> 01:20:47.417
Just the usual.

847
01:20:49.375 --> 01:20:52.667
Okay. I will call you later
so you can give me an update.

848
01:20:53.375 --> 01:20:54.458
No problem.

849
01:21:03.333 --> 01:21:08.750
<i>2IC. call your friend. Fred.
I want to sell my Sienna.</i>

850
01:21:08.833 --> 01:21:10.667
I hope there's no problem?

851
01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:12.625
That woman has escaped.

852
01:21:14.667 --> 01:21:15.708
What did you say?

853
01:21:15.792 --> 01:21:18.292
Relax. don't panic.

854
01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:21.125
Tell the boys to lay low.

855
01:21:21.208 --> 01:21:25.083
I will call to tell you when
to come take the Sienna.

856
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.208
Okay. boss.

857
01:21:48.292 --> 01:21:49.667
Mummy!

858
01:22:10.333 --> 01:22:13.542
I see you have informants on our team.

859
01:22:14.167 --> 01:22:15.917
We are all one team.

860
01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:18.000
Yeah.

861
01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:20.875
So. the raid has been completed?

862
01:22:20.958 --> 01:22:23.375
They are logging the evidence.

863
01:22:23.458 --> 01:22:28.833
I really am not sure why they had
to trouble you all the way from Abuja.

864
01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:32.708
We are here under the order
of the Inspector General.

865
01:22:35.833 --> 01:22:40.542
We will like to access the evidence
collected at the crime scene. sir.

866
01:22:41.292 --> 01:22:43.583
Well as I said.

867
01:22:44.708 --> 01:22:49.000
evidence is being logged and until
that is done. no one touches anything.

868
01:22:49.083 --> 01:22:52.250
I’m sure you know that time
is of the essence.

869
01:22:52.333 --> 01:22:54.083
we can’t sit around here waiting for...

870
01:22:54.167 --> 01:22:57.750
Hey! Bukar control your officer!

871
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.375
If you do not have respect in your unit.
don’t bring it here.

872
01:23:04.708 --> 01:23:08.417
Charles. wait for me outside.

873
01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:26.167
Well DCP Amadi. as the young man said.
we don’t have time.

874
01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:30.042
When you were doing
your own investigation.

875
01:23:30.917 --> 01:23:32.833
did you carry us along?

876
01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:36.083
We have been observing you guys.

877
01:23:36.958 --> 01:23:40.500
We have already solved the case
you guys haven't been able to.

878
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.917
All of a sudden. you've become arrogant.

879
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.125
You want to see evidence.

880
01:23:48.208 --> 01:23:51.292
Evidence that we collected.

881
01:23:54.083 --> 01:23:56.125
You think you're the FBI?

882
01:23:58.875 --> 01:24:01.667
This is not America.

883
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:07.750
Bukar. Calm down.

884
01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:13.667
Calm down.
because we're experts at this job.

885
01:24:25.375 --> 01:24:28.625
Get the arms ready.
and make sure everything is intact

886
01:24:28.708 --> 01:24:31.417
before I come.
I need to get to the office to get some.

887
01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:32.417
Good day. sir.

888
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.083
Good day. Edit. Can you take us
to the crime scene. please?

889
01:24:35.167 --> 01:24:37.167
Okay. sir. This way sir.

890
01:24:47.667 --> 01:24:50.458
<i>In the early hours of this morning.</i>

891
01:24:50.542 --> 01:24:56.583
<i>the latest victim of a vicious kidnapper
whose identity we are yet to uncover</i>

892
01:24:56.667 --> 01:25:02.208
<i>escaped from the house where she had
been held hostage for the past six weeks.</i>

893
01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:09.333
<i>Mrs. Doris Madueke.
the CEO of God’s Protection Transit.</i>

894
01:25:09.417 --> 01:25:13.083
<i>was kidnapped on her way home
from work.</i>

895
01:25:13.167 --> 01:25:16.792
<i>In the process.
a police officer was killed.</i>

896
01:25:17.625 --> 01:25:21.375
<i>Our officers were called
to the scene of the crime.</i>

897
01:25:21.458 --> 01:25:26.292
<i>were a security guard was found to have
died from a gunshot wound.</i>

898
01:25:26.375 --> 01:25:33.333
<i>Inside the house. we also found another
victim who died from suffocation.</i>

899
01:25:34.833 --> 01:25:40.417
<i>These ruthless kidnappers have
terrorized Lagos for the past few years.</i>

900
01:25:41.083 --> 01:25:46.417
<i>Collecting a minimum of one million
Dollars from each of the hostages.</i>

901
01:25:50.708 --> 01:25:52.708
One million?

902
01:25:52.792 --> 01:25:59.083
<i>This morning. I announce a reward
of 35 million Naira</i>

903
01:25:59.167 --> 01:26:02.833
<i>to anyone who comes forward
with information</i>

904
01:26:02.917 --> 01:26:07.000
<i>that leads to
the capture of these criminals.</i>

905
01:26:18.167 --> 01:26:21.458
Come on sir.
We've been here for over eight hours.

906
01:26:21.958 --> 01:26:23.000
And?

907
01:26:24.208 --> 01:26:26.458
And there’s nothing here. sir.

908
01:26:26.542 --> 01:26:27.893
We should go back and get
the evidence we already have.

909
01:26:27.917 --> 01:26:29.792
If you want to go. you can go.

910
01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:53.833
Come see this.

911
01:27:03.125 --> 01:27:04.250
Bag it.

912
01:27:08.167 --> 01:27:10.125
Hello. Wale.

913
01:27:10.208 --> 01:27:14.833
I just sent an ATM receipt to your
WhatsApp. send it to CIU for data.

914
01:27:21.333 --> 01:27:23.708
<i>His full name is Nonso Meshach Ikedieze.</i>

915
01:27:23.792 --> 01:27:27.000
<i>forwarding you his registered address
and photograph from the ATM.</i>

916
01:28:06.417 --> 01:28:07.417
Where is Meshach?

917
01:28:45.833 --> 01:28:47.726
<i>The last number he called
was one Thomas Ezekiel.</i>

918
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:49.667
Sending you the address now sir.

919
01:28:52.292 --> 01:28:54.083
- Where is Chukwuka?
- He's not here.

920
01:28:54.167 --> 01:28:57.500
- Where is Chukwuka?
- I will show you.

921
01:29:25.417 --> 01:29:27.042
Hello. Wale.

922
01:29:27.125 --> 01:29:29.042
So CIU sent all the data
from Chukuka’s phone.

923
01:29:29.125 --> 01:29:31.417
he got a call from new line
that is now inactive.

924
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:32.625
And?

925
01:29:32.708 --> 01:29:36.750
Well that line dialed only one other
number registered to one Fred Agbata.

926
01:29:36.833 --> 01:29:37.833
a car dealer.

927
01:29:45.333 --> 01:29:46.333
Fred?

928
01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:48.583
Fred Agbata?

929
01:29:48.667 --> 01:29:53.000
Sir. let me lead the interrogation.

930
01:29:53.083 --> 01:29:54.167
What?

931
01:29:55.167 --> 01:29:56.417
These are my people. sir.

932
01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:59.083
They will talk to me before
they will talk to you.

933
01:30:00.792 --> 01:30:03.625
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Of course not.

934
01:30:06.792 --> 01:30:08.583
Oh my God!

935
01:30:08.667 --> 01:30:12.042
I don't know anything
about any kidnapping.

936
01:30:12.125 --> 01:30:13.250
I don't know anything.

937
01:30:13.333 --> 01:30:16.167
Calm down.

938
01:30:18.292 --> 01:30:20.833
This number called you three days ago.

939
01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:25.042
It was an unknown number.

940
01:30:25.667 --> 01:30:26.958
What did he call you for?

941
01:30:28.542 --> 01:30:30.333
That he wants to sell a car.

942
01:30:30.417 --> 01:30:32.625
My brother. let me tell you the truth...

943
01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:38.417
Actually.
it was a car I sold to him two years ago.

944
01:30:44.333 --> 01:30:46.625
He is calling me now. Alex.

945
01:30:47.458 --> 01:30:50.667
We are supposed to meet up
to inspect a car with Mr. Edward.

946
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:51.958
Answer it.

947
01:30:52.042 --> 01:30:53.667
Put him on speaker.

948
01:30:56.333 --> 01:30:59.042
-Hello. sir.<i>-Fred. I'm coming now.</i>

949
01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:04.292
Okay. sir.

950
01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.250
I have information!

951
01:31:24.708 --> 01:31:29.042
I have information. about the kidnapper!

952
01:31:29.125 --> 01:31:35.542
Eric. he is wicked. greedy and a bastard!

953
01:31:36.125 --> 01:31:40.292
We put our lives at risk in this business.

954
01:31:40.375 --> 01:31:46.000
but he was making One Million Dollars!
Can you imagine that?

955
01:31:46.083 --> 01:31:48.250
So. how much did he pay you?

956
01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:54.167
The last time I was paid.
he gave me 15.000 dollars.

957
01:31:55.833 --> 01:31:59.375
But when my wife was sick
and needed an operation.

958
01:31:59.458 --> 01:32:02.250
he gave me an additional 2.000 dollars.

959
01:32:02.333 --> 01:32:04.250
But he only lent me the money.

960
01:32:04.333 --> 01:32:08.500
In fact. any information you need
to know about him. I will give you.

961
01:32:09.792 --> 01:32:12.250
But. I want to ask...

962
01:32:12.833 --> 01:32:18.333
But the 35 million Naira you want to give
someone with information.

963
01:32:19.292 --> 01:32:20.750
how are you guys going to pay it?

964
01:32:23.083 --> 01:32:24.333
Calm down.

965
01:32:24.833 --> 01:32:26.667
One step at a time. okay?

966
01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:29.500
So. how do you know him?

967
01:32:30.375 --> 01:32:33.000
Eric and I have been in business
together for a long time now.

968
01:32:33.083 --> 01:32:37.708
We started with the drug business.
but that collapsed.

969
01:32:37.792 --> 01:32:41.542
Then I went to the east
to hustle for jobs.

970
01:32:41.625 --> 01:32:45.167
Then five years ago. Eric called to tell
me about another business opportunity.

971
01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:47.125
He asked me to join him.

972
01:32:49.083 --> 01:32:51.958
I'm the driver for all their jobs.

973
01:32:53.833 --> 01:32:57.792
Eric. is that his real name?

974
01:32:59.042 --> 01:33:02.292
Nobody knows his real name. nobody!

975
01:33:02.375 --> 01:33:03.934
So you've been working
for him all these years

976
01:33:03.958 --> 01:33:05.598
and you never asked him
for his real name?

977
01:33:06.625 --> 01:33:11.042
Who has the guts
to ask Eric for his real name?

978
01:33:11.125 --> 01:33:12.292
We don't know where he lives.

979
01:33:12.375 --> 01:33:15.292
In fact.
he calls us with a private number.

980
01:33:15.375 --> 01:33:20.667
Even his second-in-command
doesn't know his number or where he lives.

981
01:33:21.375 --> 01:33:22.375
Yes!

982
01:33:23.208 --> 01:33:24.583
So you know Alex?

983
01:33:24.667 --> 01:33:26.708
I know Alex.

984
01:33:26.792 --> 01:33:32.583
I get my jobs through Alex. He lets
me know once there is a job.

985
01:33:37.083 --> 01:33:39.125
We know you are not the leader.

986
01:33:41.167 --> 01:33:43.583
You've probably never
killed anyone yourself.

987
01:33:45.583 --> 01:33:47.208
It was all him...

988
01:33:51.208 --> 01:33:53.583
It was all Eric.

989
01:33:59.208 --> 01:34:03.625
Look my brother. there is no need
to go to prison because of this man.

990
01:34:19.542 --> 01:34:21.500
People die everyday in this cell.

991
01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:26.333
My brother...

992
01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:28.333
I will kill you...

993
01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:32.375
- if you don't tell me what I want to hear!
- Charles! What is wrong with you?

994
01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:34.000
Charles!

995
01:34:38.833 --> 01:34:40.542
Look at this fine boy.

996
01:34:41.167 --> 01:34:42.625
Animal.

997
01:34:43.333 --> 01:34:45.667
He thinks I'm scared of a gun.

998
01:34:47.542 --> 01:34:49.083
You see him? Just forget him.

999
01:34:49.167 --> 01:34:51.792
Alex will not tell you anything.

1000
01:34:51.875 --> 01:34:54.375
The two of them are very close.

1001
01:34:54.458 --> 01:34:57.042
It's almost as if they made a blood oath.

1002
01:34:58.333 --> 01:35:05.417
And as it seems. I'm sure that Eric pays
Alex more than he pays me.

1003
01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:07.708
Okay. we need your help.

1004
01:35:07.792 --> 01:35:11.167
I will help you guys.
I'm already helping.

1005
01:35:11.250 --> 01:35:13.792
I'm all in.

1006
01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:16.333
as long as you do not charge me

1007
01:35:16.417 --> 01:35:21.250
and pay me the 35 million Naira.

1008
01:35:21.792 --> 01:35:25.000
If you help us catch him.
we will give you a cheque. immediately!

1009
01:35:25.083 --> 01:35:28.917
I'm already helping. I'm all in!

1010
01:35:35.167 --> 01:35:37.500
Hello. is that you?

1011
01:35:38.083 --> 01:35:39.667
There's a big problem here.

1012
01:35:40.333 --> 01:35:45.417
Sunday is here. he has given information
to collect the bounty!

1013
01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:46.917
Alex is here too.

1014
01:35:48.542 --> 01:35:52.083
Please. don't call me again.

1015
01:35:56.833 --> 01:35:57.833
Chidinma!

1016
01:36:03.333 --> 01:36:04.375
Chidinma!

1017
01:36:05.625 --> 01:36:07.292
I'm in the kitchen!

1018
01:36:09.250 --> 01:36:10.333
Chidinma!

1019
01:36:10.417 --> 01:36:12.167
I'm in the kitchen.

1020
01:36:14.792 --> 01:36:16.250
-Chidinma!
=What is it?

1021
01:36:16.333 --> 01:36:17.542
Listen to me.

1022
01:36:17.625 --> 01:36:21.125
Go and pack your things.

1023
01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:24.167
Get your passport. the children's too.
You are going to Ghana now!

1024
01:36:24.250 --> 01:36:25.650
Stop scaring me. what is happening?

1025
01:36:25.708 --> 01:36:27.375
Don't ask me stupid questions!

1026
01:36:28.167 --> 01:36:31.375
Food is on the fire. I'm preparing...

1027
01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:43.458
Listen to me. Our live are in danger.
Be fast!

1028
01:36:51.625 --> 01:36:53.500
Where are my children?
I want my children!

1029
01:36:54.250 --> 01:36:55.708
Daddy is mummy sick?

1030
01:36:57.375 --> 01:36:59.458
Daddy why are we going home now?

1031
01:37:08.833 --> 01:37:10.167
So. what do we know?

1032
01:37:11.667 --> 01:37:14.042
Absolutely nothing.

1033
01:37:14.833 --> 01:37:17.708
We know a lot about how
he carries out his operations.

1034
01:37:17.792 --> 01:37:21.500
but absolutely nothing about the man.

1035
01:37:22.292 --> 01:37:26.917
We don’t know his name. where he lives.
if he is married. if he has kids.

1036
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.792
And no one has a picture of him.

1037
01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:32.750
I mean. how can you know someone
for 10 years

1038
01:37:32.833 --> 01:37:35.292
and you don’t even have one picture?
One!

1039
01:37:35.375 --> 01:37:39.750
I think there’s something we’re missing.
because no one can be that careful.

1040
01:37:40.667 --> 01:37:42.059
Have you gone through the call logs?

1041
01:37:42.083 --> 01:37:46.417
Call logs from 126 sim cards.
when will I go through all of them?

1042
01:37:47.167 --> 01:37:51.417
Sir. this man has probably already
left the country by now.

1043
01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:53.167
Where are they?

1044
01:38:01.417 --> 01:38:04.042
Daddy. please come with us.

1045
01:38:04.125 --> 01:38:05.268
I don’t want to go.
I want to stay with you.

1046
01:38:05.292 --> 01:38:07.125
Tomorrow. go in.

1047
01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.417
Hello. Tony.

1048
01:38:37.917 --> 01:38:41.833
I want to sell my G-Wagon. and the Lexus.

1049
01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:46.500
Eighty million. how?
How much did I buy and renovate the house?

1050
01:38:46.583 --> 01:38:49.083
Okay. pay one-fifty.

1051
01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:52.500
Okay. one-twenty.

1052
01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:56.208
Okay. pay 100 so I can sell it now!

1053
01:38:58.542 --> 01:39:02.125
<i>The number you found is a frequently
called number registered to an Nneka.</i>

1054
01:39:02.208 --> 01:39:03.833
<i>Sending her details now. sir.</i>

1055
01:39:24.208 --> 01:39:27.042
How do you know Eric?

1056
01:39:27.125 --> 01:39:29.250
- I don't know any Eric.
- Think!

1057
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:32.750
I already have your brother.

1058
01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:36.083
so I know that you know him.

1059
01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:42.125
Look here...

1060
01:39:43.333 --> 01:39:44.333
Madam.

1061
01:39:46.292 --> 01:39:48.875
This is a serious matter.

1062
01:39:48.958 --> 01:39:51.500
He has been charged
with murder and kidnapping.

1063
01:39:52.292 --> 01:39:53.917
He's not that kind of person.

1064
01:39:55.042 --> 01:39:56.792
He's not that kind of person.

1065
01:39:58.500 --> 01:39:59.833
What does he do?

1066
01:40:00.583 --> 01:40:06.125
He's into shipping. import.
export. container...

1067
01:40:07.250 --> 01:40:08.500
Liar!

1068
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.042
You and I know that's a lie!

1069
01:40:25.417 --> 01:40:26.583
Look here...

1070
01:40:28.583 --> 01:40:30.125
Let me tell you the truth.

1071
01:40:30.833 --> 01:40:34.083
I’m sure you must have heard about the
35 mllion Naira reward

1072
01:40:34.167 --> 01:40:36.042
for anyone who will help us catch Eric.

1073
01:40:40.333 --> 01:40:44.458
If you help us catch him.
you too can get part of the reward.

1074
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:48.667
Take the money.
take care of your children.

1075
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:51.250
and we will not charge you with anything.

1076
01:40:53.542 --> 01:40:54.625
Or...

1077
01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:58.792
You can decide to stay loyal to Eric

1078
01:40:58.875 --> 01:41:02.292
and be charged as an accomplice
to murder and kidnapping.

1079
01:41:04.583 --> 01:41:07.583
A ten year sentence
at Kirikiri maximum prison.

1080
01:41:14.333 --> 01:41:16.833
Where does he live?

1081
01:41:19.417 --> 01:41:22.625
To God who made me. I don't know.

1082
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:28.333
I remember.
the name of his gateman is Joseph.

1083
01:41:30.208 --> 01:41:31.833
How do you know him?

1084
01:41:31.917 --> 01:41:36.542
Because whenever he's driving home.
he calls me.

1085
01:41:36.625 --> 01:41:40.292
and then when he gets to his gate.
he'd tell me to hold on.

1086
01:41:40.375 --> 01:41:43.292
then he'd call Joseph
on his other phone to open the gate.

1087
01:41:45.875 --> 01:41:48.083
You have been selected as

1088
01:41:48.167 --> 01:41:52.083
a part of the special task force
for Operation Chairman.

1089
01:41:53.208 --> 01:41:55.542
This is a highly classified operation.

1090
01:41:56.125 --> 01:41:58.500
That is why you were
all flown in from Abuja.

1091
01:41:59.708 --> 01:42:03.458
We are going to have eight of his close
associates under surveillance.

1092
01:42:03.542 --> 01:42:05.875
so there will be four of you on each team.

1093
01:42:05.958 --> 01:42:10.208
This suspect has been under investigation
for five years.

1094
01:42:10.292 --> 01:42:13.417
finally we have him backed into a corner.

1095
01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:16.792
All we have to do is smoke him out.

1096
01:42:28.125 --> 01:42:29.125
Hello.

1097
01:42:29.583 --> 01:42:31.000
Yes. Ike.

1098
01:42:31.833 --> 01:42:33.208
Is Sunday there?

1099
01:42:35.333 --> 01:42:36.667
Yes.

1100
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:38.708
<i>Is there anyone else with him?</i>

1101
01:42:41.333 --> 01:42:42.708
I'm not sure.

1102
01:42:43.417 --> 01:42:45.500
Okay. I will call you again.

1103
01:42:57.250 --> 01:42:58.542
Do you like your ice cream?

1104
01:42:58.625 --> 01:42:59.750
Yes

1105
01:42:59.833 --> 01:43:00.958
Good.

1106
01:43:05.708 --> 01:43:07.792
I need to use the restroom. I'll be back.

1107
01:43:18.083 --> 01:43:19.792
Do you want to go in with me?

1108
01:43:59.333 --> 01:44:01.792
Hello. are you not done?

1109
01:44:05.333 --> 01:44:06.375
Old man.

1110
01:44:07.625 --> 01:44:08.667
Shit.

1114
01:44:34.083 --> 01:44:36.042
Yes. I have been trying to call you.

1115
01:44:36.667 --> 01:44:38.375
Oh yeah. I was in the air.

1116
01:44:38.458 --> 01:44:40.083
<i>I need to travel tomorrow.</i>

1117
01:44:41.083 --> 01:44:43.542
Yes. around 4.

01:44:43.625 --> 01:44:45.292
Of course. Yes.

1119
01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.667
My brother. I've been waiting all day.

1120
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:53.708
Let's go in and talk.

1121
01:44:58.333 --> 01:45:01.000
This is 200.000 dollars.

1122
01:45:02.333 --> 01:45:03.333
What?

1123
01:45:05.708 --> 01:45:06.708
Brother...

You're leaving?

Respect yourself.

1131
01:45:39.625 --> 01:45:41.500
When are you coming back?

1132
01:45:56.667 --> 01:45:59.250
Three policemen here. and this happens?

1133
01:46:00.667 --> 01:46:02.417
Is this guy a ghost?

1134
01:46:03.167 --> 01:46:05.750

1135
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:20.875

01:46:35.583 --> 01:46:37.083
<i>Meet me outside.</i>

1141
01:46:38.667 --> 01:46:40.250
He said I should go outside.

1142
01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:44.083
Okay. I'm coming.

1143
01:46:44.167 --> 01:46:45.583
<i>Don't end the call.</i>

1144
01:46:47.292 --> 01:46:49.000
Just keep on talking and come outside.

1145

So. I should keep on talking
and come outside?

1146

01:47:18.458 --> 01:47:22.292
<i>Just keep coming towards the main road.</i>

1149
01:47:28.333 --> 01:47:30.500
I can see her.

1150
01:47:31.542 --> 01:47:35.375
Eric. I cannot see your car.

1151
01:47:47.125 --> 01:47:50.667
Yes. she's walking towards a Nissan.

1152
01:47:51.542 --> 01:47:54.875
A green Nissan Sunny. 1992 model.

1153
01:48:07.625 --> 01:48:09.167
<i>Can you move closer?</i>

1154
01:48:09.250 --> 01:48:12.333
No. I'm really close to them already.

1155
01:48:13.042 --> 01:48:15.542
If I move any closer. he will see me.

1156
01:48:38.458 --> 01:48:40.583
Hello. Amina.

1157
01:48:41.208 --> 01:48:43.083
Sir. there's an issue.

1158
01:48:55.125 --> 01:48:56.833
Is everything okay?

1159
01:48:58.500 --> 01:48:59.625
Why are you asking?

1160
01:49:00.583 --> 01:49:02.542
Oh. nothing.

1161
01:49:02.625 --> 01:49:06.792
It's just that you've never done
anything like this before.

1162
01:49:08.125 --> 01:49:10.042
I just wanted to ask.

1163
01:49:11.708 --> 01:49:15.750
It's not yet morning.

1164
01:49:16.792 --> 01:49:20.125
Eric. my body is exposed.

1165
01:49:21.333 --> 01:49:22.792
Am I complaining?

1166
01:49:28.125 --> 01:49:29.583
I'm leaving.

1167
01:49:31.833 --> 01:49:33.167
To where?

1168
01:49:35.333 --> 01:49:38.208
Nneka.
I didn't come here for questioning. okay?

1169
01:49:40.458 --> 01:49:42.917
I came to see you before I go.

1170
01:49:52.333 --> 01:49:53.458
Go where?

1171
01:50:01.833 --> 01:50:03.417
No problem.

1172
01:50:04.333 --> 01:50:05.958
But before you go.

1173
01:50:06.542 --> 01:50:12.958
at least come back
and say goodbye to the children.

1174
01:50:19.167 --> 01:50:20.458
Right. Eric?

1175
01:50:21.250 --> 01:50:24.208
Even when you come over.

1176
01:50:24.292 --> 01:50:30.583
I can make some food so
we can all eat before you go.

1177
01:50:30.667 --> 01:50:32.333
A very nice soup.

1178
01:50:41.458 --> 01:50:42.958
Okay...

1179
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:46.583
After that we can relax.

1180
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:51.833
You said you're going. let's relax first.

1181
01:50:52.625 --> 01:50:53.625
My love.

1182
01:51:03.125 --> 01:51:06.167
My love. come and relax.

1183
01:51:10.917 --> 01:51:11.917
Eric.

1184
01:51:19.583 --> 01:51:20.667
They stopped.

1185
01:51:26.042 --> 01:51:27.750
- What?
- Where are they?

1186
01:51:29.833 --> 01:51:30.750
Who?

1187
01:51:30.833 --> 01:51:33.792
The police. DSS.
What did they give you?

1188
01:51:35.208 --> 01:51:37.125
Eric. nobody gave me anything.

1189
01:51:47.125 --> 01:51:48.583
I can't see what's happening.

1190
01:51:48.667 --> 01:51:50.500
Tell me now!

1191
01:51:54.375 --> 01:51:55.958
They said they would arrest me.

1192
01:51:57.583 --> 01:52:01.625
For kidnapping and killing
a police officer.

1193
01:52:01.708 --> 01:52:07.125
They said they would give
me ten years imprisonment.

1194
01:52:12.875 --> 01:52:14.167
Shit!

1195
01:52:40.375 --> 01:52:43.333
-Hello.<i>-Hello. Samuel.</i>

Listen to me! I will pay you double.
plus 3.000 dollars!

1203
01:53:11.667 --> 01:53:16.167
Okay. I will pay five times
what we agreed on!

1204
01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:22.167
Give me 30 minutes.
I'll see what I can do.

1205
01:53:38.542 --> 01:53:39.625
He just had an accident!

1206
01:53:39.708 --> 01:53:41.417
<i>- Really?</i>

01:53:42.833 --> 01:53:47.625
-Look. I'm going closer.<i>-No.

1208
01:53:47.708 --> 01:53:49.083
There's no time!

1209
01:53:52.375 --> 01:53:55.083
<i>Charles!</i>

1210
01:54:16.667 --> 01:54:17.667

Sorry.

01:55:38.458 --> 01:55:40.500
Why didn't you call me since?

1214
01:55:40.583 --> 01:55:42.792
Sir. I have been trying
to reach you for an hour now.

1215
01:55:44.875 --> 01:55:45.875
Who is this?

1216
01:55:58.125 --> 01:55:59.125
Where is he now?

1217
01:55:59.208 --> 01:56:00.625
He threw away his phone.

1218
01:56:00.708 --> 01:56:02.476
but luckily Charles' phone
is still in the car.

1219
01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:03.780
I am asking you where he is now.

1220
01:56:04.667 --> 01:56:05.708

Joseph!

1226

Open!

1227
01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:39.583
- Sir. I think he's gone.
- You don't mean it.

1228
01:58:39.667 --> 01:58:40.833
Get out!

1229
01:58:47.667 --> 01:58:49.542

-Amina. Hello. Amina.<i>-Sir.</i>

1231
01:58:52.875 --> 01:58:56.000
She says she saw
a Ghanaian passport in his car.

1232
01:58:56.083 --> 01:58:58.333
I think he is on his way to the airport.

1233
01:58:58.417 --> 01:58:59.625
- Okay.

on this flight with a Ghanaian passport.
