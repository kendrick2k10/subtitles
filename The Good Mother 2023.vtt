00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:22.316
<i>According
to the CDC.</i>

00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:25.493
<i>overdose deaths
have tripled...</i>

5
00:02:27.843 --> 00:02:30.802
<i>The numbers continue
to surge...</i>

6
00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:33.142
Barry?
One second.

7
00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:36.188
- Sheep and wool?
- Yeah.

8
00:04:36.798 --> 00:04:38.103
It's on my desk?

9
00:04:38.103 --> 00:04:41.019
- Sheep and wool?
- Yeah. I need it today.

10
00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:42.847
Oh. yeah.
I have that. Hum...

11
00:04:43.457 --> 00:04:45.633
Sorry. I got an insane
number of hits

12
00:04:45.633 --> 00:04:47.635
on those democratic donkey
videos I posted last week.

13
00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:50.594
so I've been trying to crank
those out. but I have it.

14
00:04:50.594 --> 00:04:52.030
Great. great...

15
00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:02.171
Listen. Thomas.

16
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:03.999
What you're proposing.
however clickable.

17
00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.131
does it really feel like news?

18
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.352
And that remains
our first obligation.

19
00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:11.702
We understand we're getting
clobbered on physical.

20
00:05:11.702 --> 00:05:14.792
but we need to use the election
as a barometer.

21
00:05:15.663 --> 00:05:17.447
If paper doesn't start moving
in six months.

22
00:05:17.447 --> 00:05:19.971
then we'll know the jig is up.

23
00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:22.539
but we have to follow
the rules now.

24
00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.541
It's a new age.

25
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:26.326
That's not what
I'm fighting. here.

26
00:05:27.022 --> 00:05:29.677
I've been around long enough
to recognize a sea change...

27
00:05:30.547 --> 00:05:32.897
...but we have to be able
to do our job.

28
00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:37.075
Okay. so let's please move on.
so we can get

29
00:05:37.075 --> 00:05:39.991
to the very important work
I know you all have.

30
00:05:40.992 --> 00:05:43.255
Gill. you said it was
a heavy night?

31
00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.823
Sorry to interrupt.

32
00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:47.695
Toby?

33
00:05:48.304 --> 00:05:52.526
I need to talk to Marissa. something...

34
00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:55.137
What's going on?

35
00:05:55.137 --> 00:05:56.660
Something...
something's wrong.

36
00:06:01.665 --> 00:06:04.581
Okay. back to business.

37
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:05.930
Gill. what do you got?

38
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.497
Homicide in Arbor Hill.

39
00:06:07.497 --> 00:06:09.412
young kid gunned down...

40
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.259
You can't blame yourself
for this one.

41
00:07:14.782 --> 00:07:15.957
Mm.

42
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:36.847
Such a sudden loss.

43
00:07:38.283 --> 00:07:40.547
We pray that that this family
might find peace

44
00:07:40.547 --> 00:07:43.288
in the promise of God's
almighty kingdom.

45
00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:46.988
And while there are no words
which can undo

46
00:07:46.988 --> 00:07:50.426
the anger and despair
of such a tragedy.

47
00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:53.168
we pray that those
who have gathered

48
00:07:53.168 --> 00:07:56.998
show this grieving family
that they are not alone

49
00:07:56.998 --> 00:07:58.652
in their sorrow.

50
00:07:58.652 --> 00:08:02.743
that the son we have lost
is surrounded by love.

51
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:07.748
Now. in such tragic circumstances.

52
00:08:07.748 --> 00:08:12.187
we're sometimes tempted
by rage to dismiss God's plan...

53
00:08:13.144 --> 00:08:15.059
...to lose our own place...

54
00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:16.800
- It's not worth it.
- ...in his mercy.

55
00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:19.063
But we must remember...

56
00:08:19.063 --> 00:08:20.717
You knew she'd be here.

57
00:08:20.717 --> 00:08:23.111
...that death is but another
step closer to God.

58
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:36.603
- I'll never forget him.
- Thanks so much.

59
00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.519
Thank you.

60
00:08:43.914 --> 00:08:45.916
Mrs. Bennings.
I'm pregnant.

61
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:49.572
Ma. what the fuck
are you doing?

62
00:09:07.677 --> 00:09:09.505
I'm sorry I hit you.

63
00:09:09.505 --> 00:09:11.420
I wouldn't if I had known.

64
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.248
Yeah. I know.

65
00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:16.207
Just because of your
condition. doesn't mean I...

66
00:09:16.207 --> 00:09:17.774
Look. you don't need
to like me.

67
00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:22.866
Just this weird. shrivelled
little person.

68
00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:25.739
You sure it's his?

69
00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:27.697
Yeah. unless someone
snuck into my pussy

70
00:09:27.697 --> 00:09:28.959
and forgot it there.

71
00:09:32.484 --> 00:09:34.095
You know. I didn't
make him a junkie.

72
00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:35.357
No. I don't know that.

73
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.838
I know you made him a thief.

74
00:09:37.838 --> 00:09:40.144
He had never stolen anything
from me in his life before you.

75
00:09:40.144 --> 00:09:41.755
Is this really
about the Vitamix?

76
00:09:41.755 --> 00:09:43.191
No. It's about the lying.

77
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:45.628
stealing. money. jewelry.
and then the Vitamix.

78
00:09:45.628 --> 00:09:47.587
He gave that to me
for my fortieth birthday.

79
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.414
- You never used it.
- And you did?

80
00:09:57.684 --> 00:09:59.120
How was he living?

81
00:10:01.644 --> 00:10:03.254
We got our own place
to get clean.

82
00:10:04.952 --> 00:10:06.344
He'd been having these freakouts

83
00:10:06.344 --> 00:10:09.260
and getting really sick.
and he was scared.

84
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.047
Was he still dealing?

85
00:10:13.047 --> 00:10:14.701
Well. that's the thing.
he had stopped.

86
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:16.441
When all that tainted shit
came through here.

87
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:18.052
he decided it was time
to get away.

88
00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:21.011
He was looking to buy
this place near Chatham.

89
00:10:21.664 --> 00:10:23.231
He was excited
to start a family.

90
00:10:23.231 --> 00:10:24.624
Buy a place?

91
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.321
How was he going to afford
to buy a place?

92
00:10:26.321 --> 00:10:28.715
He made it sound like Ducky
and him had it all figured out.

93
00:10:29.237 --> 00:10:30.847
He was still hanging out
with Ducky?

94
00:10:30.847 --> 00:10:32.022
Oh. yeah.

95
00:10:32.022 --> 00:10:34.590
He was like a brother
to both of us.

96
00:10:40.901 --> 00:10:45.079
Look. I didn't come here
to argue or beg or whatever.

97
00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:47.516
I'm here because
I loved Michael.

98
00:10:47.516 --> 00:10:49.736
and I'm sad he's gone.
and I know that you are too.

99
00:10:50.824 --> 00:10:52.608
Even if you're only capable
of being mad right now.

100
00:10:52.608 --> 00:10:53.827
I know that really.
you're just sad.

101
00:11:23.944 --> 00:11:25.641
Yeah. I miss him. too.

102
00:12:40.237 --> 00:12:42.022
You got it. Mike!

103
00:12:47.462 --> 00:12:49.769
It's okay. kiddo!
That was a good pitch!

104
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.903
Who do you think
did it?

105
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.558
Well. we've got a lead.

106
00:13:40.558 --> 00:13:42.691
but I don't think that's

107
00:13:42.691 --> 00:13:44.606
what you should be thinking
about right now.

108
00:13:48.392 --> 00:13:49.437
Ugh.

109
00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:51.091
Okay.

110
00:13:52.483 --> 00:13:54.050
You remember Mike's friend.
Ducky?

111
00:13:54.877 --> 00:13:56.270
Everett Dukowski.

112
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.445
Yeah. of course.

113
00:13:58.402 --> 00:13:59.926
Well. at this point we're
pretty certain

114
00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:01.623
Everett's responsible
for bringing fentanyl

115
00:14:01.623 --> 00:14:02.711
to the South End.

116
00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:05.148
That shit is brutal.

117
00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:07.977
Junkies who get tied up in it

118
00:14:07.977 --> 00:14:10.110
don't last long.
one way or another.

119
00:14:13.504 --> 00:14:16.333
So. Michael
was tied up in it?

120
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.772
We think him and Ducky might
have been in business together.

121
00:14:20.772 --> 00:14:23.123
selling this Mother's Milk shit.

122
00:14:23.123 --> 00:14:25.125
heroin. coke and fentanyl.

123
00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:29.520
Maybe there was a fight between
them or a deal gone wrong.

124
00:14:30.434 --> 00:14:31.958
What makes you think that?

125
00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.524
Mike was killed up the block

126
00:14:33.524 --> 00:14:35.570
from one of Ducky's
stash houses.

127
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.572
And he matches a description
from a neighbour.

128
00:14:38.486 --> 00:14:41.706
When was the last time
you saw him? Mike?

129
00:14:42.664 --> 00:14:47.582
I don't know. three.
four months ago. maybe.

130
00:14:48.931 --> 00:14:50.933
Well. you got me beat.

131
00:15:08.864 --> 00:15:11.736
Jesus. you still haven't
thrown that thing out yet?

132
00:15:13.695 --> 00:15:14.870
It helps.

133
00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.004
I figured it would
make it harder.

134
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.658
Not if you don't carry
a light.

135
00:15:23.096 --> 00:15:24.924
Alright. give me
a fucking drag.

136
00:15:32.279 --> 00:15:33.541
Mmm.

137
00:15:34.846 --> 00:15:35.935
Wow.

138
00:15:37.023 --> 00:15:38.807
Pretending kind of does help.

139
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.988
I'll get Ducky. I promise.

140
00:16:23.504 --> 00:16:24.592
Come in!

141
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.774
Marissa. what are you
doing here?

142
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.343
Just wanted to make sure you
weren't too buried without me.

143
00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.825
Yeah. everything's
going okay.

144
00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:43.132
That's great.

145
00:16:43.698 --> 00:16:44.916
Um...

146
00:16:46.353 --> 00:16:48.790
We weren't expecting you back
for a month at least.

147
00:16:52.663 --> 00:16:53.969
How are you holding up?

148
00:16:55.144 --> 00:16:56.580
I want to come back to work.

149
00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:03.457
You took three months off
for Frank.

150
00:17:03.457 --> 00:17:05.459
Yeah. that was different.

151
00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:07.200
I need to come back.

152
00:17:08.679 --> 00:17:10.551
And tell me what that
looks like to you.

153
00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:15.773
Same thing as it did before.

154
00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:18.124
You hate editing.

155
00:17:21.127 --> 00:17:23.477
Walk out there right now and
look at the shit

156
00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:25.305
that Barry's been writing
since you've been gone.

157
00:17:25.305 --> 00:17:26.610
Fucking Barry?

158
00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:30.962
The one who turned the A and C
section into a donkey show?

159
00:17:30.962 --> 00:17:33.095
Okay. let's take
a second here.

160
00:17:33.095 --> 00:17:36.620
You hate Barry
and all those guys out there.

161
00:17:37.099 --> 00:17:38.318
Why?

162
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.972
Because they aren't writers.

163
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.585
They're all about numbers
and formatting

164
00:17:44.585 --> 00:17:46.587
and words per click.
or whatever.

165
00:17:47.457 --> 00:17:49.938
Hell. you barely know
what the Internet does.

166
00:17:51.592 --> 00:17:54.334
Marissa. you are my best writer.

167
00:17:54.334 --> 00:17:56.858
but for some reason.
you refuse to write.

168
00:17:57.815 --> 00:18:01.950
Take your time. but write.

169
00:18:19.837 --> 00:18:21.926
Alright. clean.

170
00:18:22.666 --> 00:18:24.581
Bullshit. it's touching
my ball.

171
00:18:24.581 --> 00:18:26.235
Watch and learn. sucker.

172
00:18:27.845 --> 00:18:29.717
- Lucky.

173
00:18:29.717 --> 00:18:31.545
I learned from the best.

174
00:18:31.545 --> 00:18:32.546
Another.

175
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.899
Alright. your shot.

176
00:18:41.294 --> 00:18:43.034
She didn't even want to join.

177
00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:45.559
She didn't want to intrude.

178
00:18:46.386 --> 00:18:49.128
She said we should have
some alone time together

179
00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.738
to just grieve.

180
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:53.654
Is that what we're doing?

181
00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:02.271
You going to be okay. Mom?

182
00:19:03.011 --> 00:19:05.274
One ball at a time.

183
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.473
Watch this. to the left!

184
00:20:14.865 --> 00:20:15.997
Let's make this quick!

185
00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:27.356
A leather case.

186
00:20:33.014 --> 00:20:34.755
It's got to be here somewhere.

187
00:20:49.857 --> 00:20:51.424
There's a back room.

188
00:20:52.903 --> 00:20:54.209
Oh. fuck.

189
00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:57.734
There!

190
00:22:14.637 --> 00:22:15.899
What are you doing?

191
00:22:16.726 --> 00:22:18.685
I've always wanted
to do that.

192
00:22:25.126 --> 00:22:26.693
Sounds weird. doesn't it?

193
00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.348
What's that?

194
00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:32.176
Paige said that Michael.
Ducky and her

195
00:22:32.176 --> 00:22:35.266
were moving into a farm.
or a house.

196
00:22:35.266 --> 00:22:36.616
something in Chatham?

197
00:22:37.443 --> 00:22:39.923
Mike. a farmer?

198
00:22:41.882 --> 00:22:44.450
I know.
It doesn't make sense.

199
00:22:46.713 --> 00:22:49.019
Listen. you've got to be
careful with that girl.

200
00:22:58.115 --> 00:22:59.465
What the fuck are you
doing here?

201
00:22:59.465 --> 00:23:00.770
Fuck. fuck. fuck.

202
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.163
Sorry. I meant to stay awake.

203
00:23:02.163 --> 00:23:03.425
What are you doing here?

204
00:23:03.425 --> 00:23:05.340
Someone broke into my house.

205
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.604
and I just didn't have
anywhere else to go.

206
00:23:10.563 --> 00:23:11.868
Were you hurt?

207
00:23:11.868 --> 00:23:13.392
Did you see who it was?

208
00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:15.742
No. but I found this.

209
00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:20.399
Hum... I think it's what
they were looking for.

210
00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.705
I found it right before
they came in.

211
00:23:23.924 --> 00:23:25.099
What is that?

212
00:23:25.578 --> 00:23:28.145
That's about $50.000 worth
of dirty heroin.

213
00:23:44.335 --> 00:23:45.772
I like the other way better.

214
00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.165
Me too.

215
00:23:48.165 --> 00:23:49.645
This baby business is tough

216
00:23:49.645 --> 00:23:51.908
but Whatever works. right?
- Right.

217
00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:01.788
How was she tonight?

218
00:24:02.484 --> 00:24:03.442
Drunk.

219
00:24:05.356 --> 00:24:06.401
Did she cry?

220
00:24:07.924 --> 00:24:10.579
She said she'd already
cried for him.

221
00:24:11.624 --> 00:24:13.190
The drinking isn't
going to help.

222
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.063
Remember how bad it got
after Frank?

223
00:24:16.063 --> 00:24:18.979
- Yeah. I definitely remember.

224
00:24:20.807 --> 00:24:22.591
Hey. Mom.
What's going on?

225
00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:26.552
Yeah. I recognize the logo.

226
00:24:28.292 --> 00:24:29.990
This is the shit
I was telling you about.

227
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.687
You're not going
to charge her. right?

228
00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:34.603
No.

229
00:24:35.648 --> 00:24:36.910
You did the right thing.

230
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.869
Is this everything?
- Everything?

231
00:24:41.654 --> 00:24:44.265
Any chance you saw the person
that broke in?

232
00:24:44.265 --> 00:24:45.962
No. I got out pretty quick.

233
00:24:48.965 --> 00:24:50.532
So. what does this mean?

234
00:24:50.532 --> 00:24:52.752
- I'm going to take this...
- This means shit just got real.

235
00:24:53.448 --> 00:24:54.841
Somebody called him that night.

236
00:24:54.841 --> 00:24:56.277
He left all freaked out.

237
00:24:56.277 --> 00:24:58.540
I had no idea what was going on.
and then. bam!

238
00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.455
You know who called him.
Paige?

239
00:25:01.543 --> 00:25:02.979
It was Ducky.

240
00:25:07.027 --> 00:25:08.028
Alright?

241
00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:10.596
We checked his phone.

242
00:25:13.033 --> 00:25:13.990
Thank you. Paige.

243
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.210
I'm going to take this
to the station.

244
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:17.298
Okay?

245
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:29.789
I'll get you a blanket
for the couch.

246
00:25:30.572 --> 00:25:31.921
Thank you.

247
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.379
Did my puking wake you up?

248
00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.381
No.

249
00:25:57.381 --> 00:25:58.731
You feeling any better?

250
00:25:59.993 --> 00:26:01.385
Not at all.

251
00:26:04.258 --> 00:26:05.868
Did you ever have
any weird cravings

252
00:26:05.868 --> 00:26:07.261
when you were pregnant?

253
00:26:09.872 --> 00:26:11.395
Necco wafers.

254
00:26:11.395 --> 00:26:12.962
What the hell's
a necco wafer?

255
00:26:12.962 --> 00:26:16.183
It's like this little
disk-shaped candy. you know?

256
00:26:16.183 --> 00:26:18.794
It tastes like...
tastes like chalk.

257
00:26:18.794 --> 00:26:20.796
I must have eaten
my body weight in them.

258
00:26:21.754 --> 00:26:23.016
I want Play-doh.

259
00:26:23.973 --> 00:26:25.061
Play-doh?

260
00:26:25.845 --> 00:26:27.237
That can't be good for the baby.

261
00:26:27.237 --> 00:26:28.978
Kids eat it all the time
and they're fine.

262
00:26:30.023 --> 00:26:32.329
Well. you should ask
your doctor about that.

263
00:26:36.246 --> 00:26:37.291
Yeah.

264
00:26:38.466 --> 00:26:39.728
You have a doctor. right?

265
00:26:40.816 --> 00:26:43.645
Yeah. well. we went to one
straight when we found out.

266
00:26:43.645 --> 00:26:45.604
but the budget
was pretty tight. so...

267
00:26:46.387 --> 00:26:49.303
We were saving up to go again.

268
00:26:49.303 --> 00:26:52.175
Come on. you need
to see a doctor.

269
00:26:52.175 --> 00:26:54.830
- What. right now?
- No. like a month ago.

270
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.572
but yeah. now's better
than later.

271
00:27:01.315 --> 00:27:03.796
Uh. I have to stop by work.
but it won't take long.

272
00:27:04.492 --> 00:27:06.799
I'll give you a ride home
when I'm done.

273
00:27:07.887 --> 00:27:09.671
Depends on what you mean
by "home".

274
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.068
- I'll see you soon.
- See you.

275
00:27:20.726 --> 00:27:22.902
<i>Pick up the phone.
come on!</i>

276
00:27:22.902 --> 00:27:26.557
<i>I just wanted to say that
I figured some things out</i>

277
00:27:26.557 --> 00:27:30.387
<i>and I have a plan. you know.</i>

278
00:27:32.215 --> 00:27:35.044
<i>They said it made sense. I...</i>

279
00:27:36.829 --> 00:27:40.746
<i>I know you were right
to kick me out of the house...</i>

280
00:27:42.443 --> 00:27:46.012
<i>...but. you know. a little bit
of fucking cash right now</i>

281
00:27:46.012 --> 00:27:48.231
<i>would really go a long way
to getting...</i>

282
00:27:49.537 --> 00:27:51.147
<i>I know you're in the house!</i>

283
00:27:51.147 --> 00:27:53.541
<i>I can see you moving
in the house!</i>

284
00:27:54.847 --> 00:27:56.892
<i>Let me in. it's my shit!</i>

285
00:27:56.892 --> 00:27:59.329
<i>You changed the fucking
locks. Mom!</i>

286
00:27:59.329 --> 00:28:01.505
<i>What the... Mom!</i>

287
00:28:01.505 --> 00:28:04.508
<i>Hey. Mom. I can't expect you
to pick up this time.</i>

288
00:28:04.508 --> 00:28:08.382
<i>I just want to say...</i>
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

289
00:28:08.382 --> 00:28:09.992
<i>So does Paige.</i>

290
00:28:09.992 --> 00:28:13.866
<i>Um. I want you to know that
we're doing a lot better.</i>

291
00:28:13.866 --> 00:28:16.956
<i>Um. there's something I want
to tell you in person.</i>

292
00:28:18.392 --> 00:28:19.828
<i>I love you so much.</i>

293
00:28:20.829 --> 00:28:22.178
<i>Bye.</i>

294
00:28:40.283 --> 00:28:41.850
Are you fucking serious?

295
00:28:46.202 --> 00:28:47.508
Paige?

296
00:28:48.161 --> 00:28:49.292
It's Gina.

297
00:28:49.292 --> 00:28:50.424
Hey!

298
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:52.295
What are you doing here?

299
00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:55.342
Um. same as me. I guess.

300
00:28:55.342 --> 00:28:57.387
Marissa's supposed
to be picking me up.

301
00:28:57.387 --> 00:28:58.693
Oh.

302
00:28:59.563 --> 00:29:01.652
Do you mind if I join you?

303
00:29:02.566 --> 00:29:03.742
Sure.

304
00:29:09.225 --> 00:29:10.400
Ugh...

305
00:29:12.838 --> 00:29:14.056
I like your necklace.

306
00:29:16.189 --> 00:29:17.581
I stole it from Target.

307
00:29:17.581 --> 00:29:20.584
- It suits you. I guess.

308
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.804
Thanks.

309
00:29:23.892 --> 00:29:26.155
Uh. I just mean...

310
00:29:26.155 --> 00:29:28.027
No. it's okay.
I know what you meant.

311
00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:30.072
Sorry.

312
00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:34.860
Can I ask you a question?

313
00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:37.688
What's it like being
married to a cop?

314
00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.910
Um. it's not so different
from anything else.

315
00:29:44.565 --> 00:29:46.045
There's just a part of you
that accepts

316
00:29:46.045 --> 00:29:47.786
he might not come home one day.

317
00:29:50.353 --> 00:29:52.355
Sounds a lot like dating
a junkie.

318
00:29:57.883 --> 00:29:59.406
She's not fucking coming.

319
00:30:00.015 --> 00:30:01.234
I can give you a ride.

320
00:30:02.888 --> 00:30:04.585
- You sure?
- Yeah. of course.

321
00:30:29.566 --> 00:30:31.133
Didn't go so well
at work. huh?

322
00:30:31.655 --> 00:30:33.005
Sorry. I forgot.

323
00:30:34.267 --> 00:30:35.921
You had important things
to do.

324
00:30:35.921 --> 00:30:37.748
- Stop it.

325
00:30:37.748 --> 00:30:39.489
No. you fucking stop it!

326
00:30:39.489 --> 00:30:40.882
Excuse me?

327
00:30:40.882 --> 00:30:42.797
You just keep fucking hiding
from everything.

328
00:30:42.797 --> 00:30:44.103
and it's really fucking hard
to look at.

329
00:30:44.103 --> 00:30:45.321
It's shitty for all of us.

330
00:30:45.321 --> 00:30:46.583
Just stop pretending
you're alone.

331
00:30:54.722 --> 00:30:56.680
I want to go back to Al-Anon.

332
00:30:57.594 --> 00:30:58.857
Well. that's a good start.

333
00:30:59.901 --> 00:31:02.773
I'll come with you. make sure
it's not a drunk promise.

334
00:31:02.773 --> 00:31:03.862
Mm.

335
00:31:20.226 --> 00:31:21.792
For what it's worth.
Michael used to say

336
00:31:21.792 --> 00:31:23.446
you were a really good writer.

337
00:31:25.971 --> 00:31:27.233
Oh. yeah?

338
00:31:29.757 --> 00:31:31.237
What else did he say?

339
00:31:35.719 --> 00:31:37.547
He said that before
Frank died.

340
00:31:37.547 --> 00:31:39.158
he remembered you were happy.

341
00:31:44.859 --> 00:31:46.252
When did he say that?

342
00:31:46.252 --> 00:31:47.427
All the time.

343
00:31:48.167 --> 00:31:49.777
I wish I got to meet him.

344
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:54.042
No. well then you'd know...

345
00:31:54.042 --> 00:31:55.957
you'd know what
an asshole he was.

346
00:31:57.045 --> 00:31:58.699
Even when he got sick?

347
00:31:58.699 --> 00:32:00.657
Especially when he got sick.

348
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:04.096
Yeah. but...

349
00:32:07.012 --> 00:32:08.535
Did you ever stop missing him?

350
00:32:13.018 --> 00:32:14.106
Never.

351
00:32:18.719 --> 00:32:20.547
Well. that's a drag.

352
00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:25.944
Oh. god.

353
00:32:27.858 --> 00:32:29.773
- Who's that?
- That's Toby.

354
00:32:29.773 --> 00:32:32.080
- Oh. man.
- Look at his hair.

355
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.473
Sweet.

356
00:32:33.473 --> 00:32:35.040
We should get yours
one of these.

357
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.085
It makes nursing easier.
- Yeah?

358
00:32:48.662 --> 00:32:49.968
I'm going to bed.

359
00:32:50.794 --> 00:32:51.926
Okay.

360
00:32:52.709 --> 00:32:53.710
Goodnight.

361
00:32:54.233 --> 00:32:55.364
Goodnight.

362
00:33:09.683 --> 00:33:11.815
I think I still have
one of these at the house.

363
00:33:11.815 --> 00:33:13.034
believe it or not.

364
00:33:13.034 --> 00:33:14.296
Mm-hmm.

365
00:33:16.037 --> 00:33:17.778
Oh. hey. we could use these.

366
00:33:17.778 --> 00:33:19.823
especially if we go
with the pump.

367
00:33:20.781 --> 00:33:21.912
Yeah...

368
00:33:22.522 --> 00:33:23.653
Nothing?

369
00:33:24.611 --> 00:33:27.657
Okay. well. I'm glad it's
my baby we're shopping for.

370
00:33:27.657 --> 00:33:29.137
Oh. fuck yes!

371
00:33:29.137 --> 00:33:30.312
Excuse me?

372
00:33:31.357 --> 00:33:33.098
- We got a lead.
- A what?

373
00:33:33.098 --> 00:33:34.534
We got a lead.

374
00:33:37.885 --> 00:33:40.670
Let them do their investigation.
but in the meantime.

375
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.325
it can't hurt to get the story
ourselves. you know?

376
00:33:43.325 --> 00:33:45.371
I mean. maybe it'll be the same
thing they told the cops.

377
00:33:45.371 --> 00:33:47.068
but I want to hear it myself.

378
00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:48.852
Listen. it's something
we can actually do

379
00:33:48.852 --> 00:33:50.811
instead of sitting
around moping.

380
00:33:50.811 --> 00:33:52.160
It's a lead!

381
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.032
You know. this isn't
ethical or legal.

382
00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:55.337
Sure it is.

383
00:34:14.008 --> 00:34:15.053
- Hey.
- Jeremy?

384
00:34:15.053 --> 00:34:16.054
Come on in.

385
00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:17.185
I heard the shots.

386
00:34:17.185 --> 00:34:18.839
but Jack was the one who saw it.

387
00:34:20.101 --> 00:34:21.929
He's a little out of it
from his meds.

388
00:34:22.625 --> 00:34:24.366
Grandpa sits a lot
because of his hip.

389
00:34:24.366 --> 00:34:26.151
He was sitting right
there when it happened.

390
00:34:26.151 --> 00:34:28.153
Hi. Jack. nice to meet you.

391
00:34:28.153 --> 00:34:29.415
I'm Marissa.

392
00:34:29.415 --> 00:34:31.504
I work for the Times Union.

393
00:34:32.418 --> 00:34:34.202
So. you saw what happened?

394
00:34:35.551 --> 00:34:38.467
Grandpa. you remember
what happened the other night?

395
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.427
Marissa's son was shot.

396
00:34:41.427 --> 00:34:43.385
He was killed. remember?

397
00:34:43.385 --> 00:34:45.866
He was the one you saw die
in front of the house.

398
00:34:45.866 --> 00:34:47.215
That's too bad.

399
00:34:47.737 --> 00:34:49.261
I'm sorry.

400
00:34:49.261 --> 00:34:51.567
I thought you said he saw
what happened that night.

401
00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:53.961
Come on. nothing?
- Paige. hey.

402
00:34:53.961 --> 00:34:55.963
Jack. just think.
Please. just think.

403
00:34:55.963 --> 00:34:57.965
- Let's not be rude.
- I'm not being rude.

404
00:34:58.618 --> 00:35:01.577
Grandpa. you said there was
someone outside yelling.

405
00:35:01.577 --> 00:35:02.883
and then...
- With the truck?

406
00:35:02.883 --> 00:35:04.450
Yeah. with the truck.

407
00:35:08.323 --> 00:35:12.327
The boy was standing in the
street yelling his head off.

408
00:35:12.327 --> 00:35:14.895
Then. I heard the truck.

409
00:35:15.983 --> 00:35:18.290
I think the kid he was
calling for lives there.

410
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.161
because I've seen him
there before.

411
00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:21.467
Ducky!

412
00:35:34.741 --> 00:35:36.046
Hope
that was helpful.

413
00:36:18.263 --> 00:36:20.352
- Hey. Laurie.
- Hey.

414
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:22.354
How you been?

415
00:36:23.485 --> 00:36:24.878
Just getting by.

416
00:36:24.878 --> 00:36:27.185
Thank you for being here. everyone.

417
00:36:28.229 --> 00:36:31.101
Come. come into the circle.

418
00:36:31.798 --> 00:36:33.147
Have a seat.

419
00:36:33.147 --> 00:36:34.844
It's a sunny day and we're all
in a basement.

420
00:36:34.844 --> 00:36:38.108
but we're going to get to know
each other and talk.

421
00:36:39.675 --> 00:36:43.331
I see some new faces. welcome.

422
00:36:43.331 --> 00:36:46.900
And some who we haven't seen
for a while.

423
00:36:47.901 --> 00:36:49.424
It's good to have you back.

424
00:36:50.469 --> 00:36:51.687
Our...

425
00:36:52.819 --> 00:36:54.777
We had you in our prayers.

426
00:36:54.777 --> 00:37:00.261
Uh. okay. so. who wants
to start us off today?

427
00:37:03.395 --> 00:37:05.005
Any thoughts? Any...

428
00:37:05.353 --> 00:37:07.312
Oh. Laurie!

429
00:37:10.793 --> 00:37:17.191
I lost my daughter. Jessica.
about three months ago now.

430
00:37:20.673 --> 00:37:21.848
Haven't...

431
00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:24.416
... haven't really felt capable

432
00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:27.070
of sharing too much about it
until now.

433
00:37:28.115 --> 00:37:29.856
I'm sure a lot of you
know the feeling.

434
00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:32.946
Mm.

435
00:37:34.164 --> 00:37:37.124
Jessica was a hard kid to raise.

436
00:37:38.473 --> 00:37:43.130
I think. sometimes. we paint
our kids as saints.

437
00:37:46.394 --> 00:37:49.049
Jessica was not a saint...

438
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.269
...the opposite.

439
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:53.314
She was kind of a pain
in the ass.

440
00:37:56.186 --> 00:37:59.538
So. anyway. the morning
I found her.

441
00:37:59.538 --> 00:38:01.061
I was about to go to work.

442
00:38:01.061 --> 00:38:03.106
so I went to her room
to wake her up.

443
00:38:18.339 --> 00:38:22.169
You don't realize it
at the time...

444
00:38:23.953 --> 00:38:27.217
...but that walk to the door
is the last time

445
00:38:27.217 --> 00:38:30.525
you are who you think you are.

446
00:38:33.354 --> 00:38:35.008
But you don't know.

447
00:38:36.052 --> 00:38:37.358
I didn't know.

448
00:38:39.273 --> 00:38:43.799
So. I opened the door.
and there she is.

449
00:38:43.799 --> 00:38:47.150
laying on the bed.
fully clothed.

450
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.152
candles lit around her.

451
00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.157
At first. I was furious.

452
00:38:54.157 --> 00:38:58.466
You know. she had fallen asleep
with candles burning.

453
00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:02.427
And I start screaming at her.
"Are you crazy?

454
00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:05.343
You're going to burn
the house down."

455
00:39:13.916 --> 00:39:19.226
And then. I see it. a tiny
little bag on the carpet.

456
00:39:20.009 --> 00:39:23.273
And I... I just look at it.

457
00:39:26.189 --> 00:39:28.801
I remember the logo on the bag.

458
00:39:28.801 --> 00:39:31.499
It's seared into my head.
you know?

459
00:39:33.283 --> 00:39:35.198
M.M.

460
00:39:36.635 --> 00:39:39.159
When you see something
like that.

461
00:39:39.159 --> 00:39:41.379
you know. everything cracks.

462
00:39:42.597 --> 00:39:44.904
The stories you made crack.

463
00:39:45.774 --> 00:39:49.387
Who you thought
your kid was cracks.

464
00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:53.434
Who you thought you were cracks.

465
00:39:54.957 --> 00:39:57.307
You're that family. now.

466
00:39:59.092 --> 00:40:02.400
You never realized
you were that family.

467
00:40:22.202 --> 00:40:24.770
Hey. I'm going to walk back.

468
00:40:26.162 --> 00:40:28.164
You should offer Laurie a ride.

469
00:40:28.164 --> 00:40:30.993
Uh. I'm pretty sure she wants
to be left alone.

470
00:40:30.993 --> 00:40:32.560
No. that's what you want.

471
00:40:33.735 --> 00:40:35.607
I'm going to check
some of Ducky's spots.

472
00:40:49.359 --> 00:40:51.492
Hey. Laurie. Hey!

473
00:40:51.492 --> 00:40:52.711
Marissa!

474
00:40:52.711 --> 00:40:54.277
Do you want a ride?

475
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.530
I can't believe I'm actually
going to ask this. but...

476
00:41:31.532 --> 00:41:33.055
...could I interview you?

477
00:41:33.926 --> 00:41:35.449
Interview me?

478
00:41:35.449 --> 00:41:38.321
You... put some things
into words

479
00:41:38.321 --> 00:41:40.541
I haven't been able to yet.

480
00:41:40.541 --> 00:41:43.544
You know all that stuff
is confidential. right?

481
00:41:43.544 --> 00:41:46.547
Yeah. of course.
That's the point.

482
00:41:46.547 --> 00:41:49.681
I want you to talk to me on the
record. you know. mom to mom.

483
00:41:50.377 --> 00:41:51.552
For what?

484
00:41:53.685 --> 00:41:56.078
Well. I don't know yet.

485
00:41:56.078 --> 00:41:59.865
But baybe if I write it.
I'll know.

486
00:42:02.302 --> 00:42:03.521
Thanks again.

487
00:42:04.173 --> 00:42:06.349
Hey. what's going on here?

488
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:11.354
This is a safe injection site
and needle exchange for users.

489
00:42:12.312 --> 00:42:13.574
What?

490
00:42:13.574 --> 00:42:16.490
Maybe if my baby had gone
to one of these

491
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:20.276
instead of hiding in her room.
she wouldn't have died.

492
00:42:22.061 --> 00:42:24.367
This at least takes
that danger away.

493
00:42:28.371 --> 00:42:30.199
You should come check it out.

494
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:35.161
If helping and healing
is actually what you want.

495
00:42:35.161 --> 00:42:37.990
you really need to see it
for what it is.

496
00:43:06.845 --> 00:43:09.325
- Alright. ready?
- Yeah.

497
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.424
Hey. John.
Hey. Diane.

498
00:43:21.424 --> 00:43:24.732
Marissa. this is Diane.

499
00:43:24.732 --> 00:43:29.215
She coordinates the distribution
of fentanyl test strips.

500
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:33.872
She tells me where to go.
how to help.

501
00:43:33.872 --> 00:43:36.178
how to stay out of...

502
00:43:36.178 --> 00:43:37.571
Hey. you okay?

503
00:43:37.571 --> 00:43:38.920
Marissa?

504
00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.357
Uh. excuse me.

505
00:43:51.454 --> 00:43:52.978
<i>You're looking
for Toby Bennings.</i>

506
00:43:52.978 --> 00:43:54.632
<i>Leave a message.</i>

507
00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:58.287
Ducky! Ducky. I just want
to talk to you!

508
00:44:14.303 --> 00:44:15.653
Ducky!

509
00:46:01.367 --> 00:46:03.021
- Paige!
- Hey.

510
00:46:04.674 --> 00:46:06.328
- Is everything alright?
- Yeah.

511
00:46:06.328 --> 00:46:08.113
Yeah. Everything's cool. sorry.

512
00:46:08.113 --> 00:46:10.942
I just came by to talk
to Gina. actually.

513
00:46:10.942 --> 00:46:15.337
Uh. she went out
with some friends after work.

514
00:46:15.337 --> 00:46:17.644
so she's not going to be back
until later.

515
00:46:17.644 --> 00:46:19.124
Oh. okay. of course.

516
00:46:19.124 --> 00:46:20.778
Sorry for being creepy.

517
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:22.605
I just thought it would be nice
to talk to someone

518
00:46:22.605 --> 00:46:24.477
who doesn't actually feel
like a parent

519
00:46:24.477 --> 00:46:27.393
and. like. actually has
their shit together.

520
00:46:27.393 --> 00:46:28.611
Yeah. I get you.

521
00:46:28.611 --> 00:46:30.048
I'll tell her you stopped by.
- Okay.

522
00:46:30.048 --> 00:46:31.876
- Have a good night.
- See you.

523
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:38.708
Uh. Paige. if you want.
you can come in.

524
00:46:38.708 --> 00:46:40.406
- Yeah?
- In a way...

525
00:46:41.363 --> 00:46:46.020
...we're kind of family now.
so... come on.

526
00:47:16.921 --> 00:47:18.836
Fuck. you alright?

527
00:47:19.575 --> 00:47:21.839
I thought I killed you.

528
00:47:23.579 --> 00:47:25.407
What the fuck are you doing
following me?

529
00:47:27.627 --> 00:47:28.933
You killed my son.

530
00:47:28.933 --> 00:47:30.760
No. I fucking didn't.

531
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.719
You fucking believe that shit?

532
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:38.377
So. what happened. then?

533
00:47:40.074 --> 00:47:41.641
What happened. Ducky?

534
00:47:43.034 --> 00:47:45.036
Look. all I know
is somebody called me

535
00:47:45.036 --> 00:47:46.907
and told me Mike was in trouble

536
00:47:46.907 --> 00:47:49.040
and that he needed
to get out of his house.

537
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:51.999
So. I called him
and I told him to meet me

538
00:47:51.999 --> 00:47:53.609
at the squat house right away.

539
00:47:53.609 --> 00:47:55.437
I thought I was protecting him.

540
00:47:55.437 --> 00:47:57.135
What the fuck would you do?

541
00:47:57.135 --> 00:47:58.832
I didn't know they were going
to fucking kill him.

542
00:47:58.832 --> 00:48:00.007
That's convenient.

543
00:48:00.007 --> 00:48:01.879
No. It sucks. Mrs. Bennings.

544
00:48:03.793 --> 00:48:05.795
I was his fucking best friend.

545
00:48:05.795 --> 00:48:07.928
Then. who killed him?

546
00:48:10.452 --> 00:48:12.498
I never met the guy.
but he drives around

547
00:48:12.498 --> 00:48:13.934
in this white truck

548
00:48:13.934 --> 00:48:16.197
and has this fucking
stupid tattoo on his hand.

549
00:48:17.764 --> 00:48:18.896
That's all I know.

550
00:48:22.377 --> 00:48:24.118
Nobody fucking believes me.

551
00:48:26.077 --> 00:48:27.426
Ducky!

552
00:48:27.426 --> 00:48:29.863
Hey. you! What are
you doing in there?

553
00:48:38.611 --> 00:48:40.395
Holy shit. Mom.
Are you okay?

554
00:48:40.395 --> 00:48:41.831
Yeah. I'm fine.

555
00:48:41.831 --> 00:48:43.137
I just needed to talk to you.

556
00:48:43.137 --> 00:48:44.443
Fuck. Marissa. what happened?

557
00:48:47.185 --> 00:48:50.449
I... found your friend Ducky.

558
00:48:51.276 --> 00:48:53.147
- What?
- Yeah.

559
00:48:55.062 --> 00:48:56.672
Yeah. he was at the food bank.

560
00:48:56.672 --> 00:49:00.502
I followed him to the train
yard down on Church Street.

561
00:49:00.502 --> 00:49:01.634
You followed him?

562
00:49:01.634 --> 00:49:02.940
He snuck up

563
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.376
and hit me with something.

564
00:49:04.376 --> 00:49:05.638
He could have killed you. Mom.

565
00:49:05.638 --> 00:49:07.466
I know. but he talked to me.

566
00:49:07.466 --> 00:49:08.902
Talked to you?

567
00:49:11.165 --> 00:49:12.775
You got any whisky?

568
00:49:12.775 --> 00:49:14.473
I'm going to go out
and look for him.

569
00:49:14.473 --> 00:49:15.648
He couldn't have gotten far.

570
00:49:19.391 --> 00:49:20.783
You sure it was him?

571
00:49:21.393 --> 00:49:22.611
I'm sure.

572
00:49:23.221 --> 00:49:24.874
Well. did he say anything?

573
00:49:24.874 --> 00:49:27.268
He said it was a guy
with a tattoo on his hand.

574
00:49:27.268 --> 00:49:28.878
that he didn't do it.

575
00:49:28.878 --> 00:49:30.141
No shit he didn't do it.

576
00:49:30.141 --> 00:49:31.446
He's not a fucking murderer.

577
00:49:31.446 --> 00:49:33.231
You expect me to believe
that the man

578
00:49:33.231 --> 00:49:35.407
who just knocked me unconscious
isn't a violent person?

579
00:49:35.407 --> 00:49:37.583
What would you do if someone
followed you like that?

580
00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:39.541
You really don't understand.

581
00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:41.326
He told Mike to meet him there.

582
00:49:41.326 --> 00:49:42.980
He set him up. Paige.

583
00:51:17.117 --> 00:51:18.379
Ducky!

584
00:51:25.908 --> 00:51:27.171
Ducky!

585
00:51:38.182 --> 00:51:39.270
Hello!

586
00:52:04.556 --> 00:52:05.861
Ducky!

587
00:54:26.132 --> 00:54:27.699
Hey. sorry. I was downstairs.

588
00:54:27.699 --> 00:54:30.789
- Can I come inside?
- Uh. yeah. okay.

589
00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:35.707
What's happening?
You alright?

590
00:54:35.707 --> 00:54:36.838
Ducky's dead.

591
00:54:38.362 --> 00:54:41.713
Uh. how do you know?

592
00:54:42.757 --> 00:54:45.325
Because I went to that old
house and I found him.

593
00:54:45.325 --> 00:54:46.979
He killed himself.

594
00:54:49.198 --> 00:54:50.852
Fuck. okay...

595
00:54:50.852 --> 00:54:52.071
Uh...

596
00:54:52.071 --> 00:54:53.333
Oh. god.

597
00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:57.772
Alright. look. just sit down.

598
00:54:57.772 --> 00:54:59.992
I'll get you some water.
You okay?

599
00:54:59.992 --> 00:55:01.298
Yeah.

600
00:55:05.563 --> 00:55:06.999
Just have a drink.

601
00:55:06.999 --> 00:55:08.435
Take a few deep breaths.

602
00:55:12.874 --> 00:55:14.441
Fuck.

603
00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:17.488
Was anyone else there?

604
00:55:17.488 --> 00:55:18.837
No. it was just me.

605
00:55:18.837 --> 00:55:20.142
And. um...

606
00:55:21.143 --> 00:55:24.190
Yeah. I saw his body.
and then I left.

607
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:26.279
Got it. okay.

608
00:55:26.801 --> 00:55:29.674
Uh. why didn't you call 911?

609
00:55:29.674 --> 00:55:31.719
Because I knew I wasn't
supposed to be there.

610
00:55:31.719 --> 00:55:34.026
That's why I'm here.
I knew that you could help.

611
00:55:34.026 --> 00:55:35.854
Sure. I'm sorry.

612
00:55:35.854 --> 00:55:38.465
I'm really sorry for your loss.

613
00:55:39.074 --> 00:55:41.250
I'll get someone to go around
there right away.

614
00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:45.690
You just take it easy
and make yourself at home.

615
00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:47.909
I'm just going to be
two minutes. alright?
- Okay.

616
00:56:37.872 --> 00:56:39.047
Oh...

617
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:03.202
Fuck.

618
00:57:37.279 --> 00:57:39.325
Hi. I need someone to go
to the address

619
00:57:39.325 --> 00:57:42.763
and just check it out
right away.

620
00:57:45.505 --> 00:57:46.898
Yeah. that's right.

621
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:51.163
I need someone to go to 1-2-5-8
and check if possible.

622
00:57:57.778 --> 00:57:59.388
This one's personal.

623
00:59:25.518 --> 00:59:26.693
Paige?

624
01:00:04.992 --> 01:00:06.603
Paige. give me the phone.
- Get back.

625
01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.169
- Just give me the phone.
- No.

626
01:00:08.169 --> 01:00:09.867
- Give me the phone.
- Back the fuck off.

627
01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:11.303
- Paige...
- No.

628
01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:19.964
Listen to me.

629
01:00:19.964 --> 01:00:21.879
You don't understand
what's going on here.

630
01:00:21.879 --> 01:00:23.445
- Toby. no.
- Please.

631
01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:25.143
- Back up.
- I can explain.

632
01:00:25.143 --> 01:00:27.319
- Back the fuck up.
- Listen to me.

633
01:00:27.319 --> 01:00:29.060
Just give me the phone.
- Back the fuck away.

634
01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.452
I'm telling you.
- Back the fuck up!

635
01:00:30.452 --> 01:00:32.106
I can explain!
I can explain this. Paige!

636
01:00:32.106 --> 01:00:33.281
Just calm down!

637
01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:35.501
Just stop. okay!

638
01:00:35.501 --> 01:00:37.329
Calm down. give me the phone.

639
01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:39.244
Fuck you!
Get the fuck away from me!

640
01:00:39.244 --> 01:00:41.115
- Paige!
- Just back the fuck up!

641
01:00:41.115 --> 01:00:42.726
Get out of my way!
Don't touch me!

642
01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:44.162
- Just give me...
- Away!

643
01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:46.294
- Give me the fucking phone!
- Get the fuck off me!

644
01:00:46.294 --> 01:00:47.905
Give me the phone!
Paige!

645
01:00:47.905 --> 01:00:49.123
Stop!

646
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.361
Fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck.

647
01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:11.363
Paige! Paige!

648
01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:13.365
Hey. hey.

649
01:01:13.365 --> 01:01:15.715
Oh. fuck.

650
01:01:18.022 --> 01:01:19.110
Oh. fuck.

651
01:01:56.538 --> 01:01:57.670
Fuck.

652
01:02:17.124 --> 01:02:18.256
Fuck.

653
01:03:06.347 --> 01:03:07.784
Hey. I'm home.

654
01:03:09.437 --> 01:03:10.525
Gina!

655
01:03:10.525 --> 01:03:12.179
Call an ambulance. quick!

656
01:03:12.179 --> 01:03:14.225
Gina. it's Paige.
call an ambulance!

657
01:03:14.225 --> 01:03:15.835
She fell in the bathroom.

658
01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:17.663
I think she OD'd!
She's bleeding!

659
01:03:19.273 --> 01:03:20.797
Just get an ambulance
right now!

660
01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.059
Okay. okay!

661
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:25.497
Hi. um...

662
01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:29.109
Fuck. fuck!

663
01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:37.074
Toby. I think Paige
is hiding something.

664
01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:38.597
Yeah. you're right.

665
01:03:39.293 --> 01:03:41.208
She's using again
and she overdosed.

666
01:03:41.208 --> 01:03:42.601
What?

667
01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:44.690
She's on her way
to the hospital right now.

668
01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:47.562
<i>Meet us at St. Peter's.</i>

669
01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:35.523
The forceps. please.

670
01:04:40.528 --> 01:04:42.139
A little more space.

671
01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:45.490
Alright.

672
01:04:49.842 --> 01:04:50.887
Alright.

673
01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:53.715
We have a flatline.

674
01:04:53.715 --> 01:04:54.803
Get the crash cart.

675
01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:34.458
Hi. cat.

676
01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:36.024
There's a baby.

677
01:08:36.547 --> 01:08:37.809
Make acquaintance.

678
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:35.171
Jesus Christ.
You scared me.

679
01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.085
Sorry. I let myself in.

680
01:09:37.695 --> 01:09:38.826
You okay?

681
01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:40.959
It's a nice room.

682
01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:44.745
Perfect for the little angel.

683
01:09:46.834 --> 01:09:48.619
I've got to get her
her bottle.

684
01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:50.577
Here. come on.

685
01:09:52.579 --> 01:09:53.580
Here.

686
01:09:57.628 --> 01:09:59.325
There you go.

687
01:10:01.762 --> 01:10:02.937
Yeah.

688
01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:08.552
What's going on?

689
01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:12.860
I found something.

690
01:10:24.655 --> 01:10:27.745
Marissa. I found it under
the stairs. in the basement.

691
01:10:28.528 --> 01:10:31.227
I thought it was some kind
of miracle...

692
01:10:32.358 --> 01:10:35.231
...like a gift.
left as a reminder.

693
01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:37.407
But then I saw the blood.

694
01:10:37.407 --> 01:10:40.366
- How...
- I don't know...

695
01:10:41.846 --> 01:10:45.023
I've been trying to think
of every possible reason.

696
01:10:45.023 --> 01:10:46.198
I...

697
01:11:02.388 --> 01:11:03.955
Have you asked him about it?

698
01:11:03.955 --> 01:11:04.956
No.

699
01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.002
I can't find the words.

700
01:11:14.661 --> 01:11:16.141
So. what are you going to do?

701
01:11:23.627 --> 01:11:25.585
I don't know what
the right thing to do is.

702
01:11:27.457 --> 01:11:29.328
I don't know if I could do it. anyways.

703
01:11:38.598 --> 01:11:40.600
<i>I know.
I feel guilty too.</i>

704
01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.646
<i>I've got to leave.
but I don't think</i>

705
01:11:42.646 --> 01:11:44.865
<i>that's what you should be
thinking about right now. Mom.</i>

706
01:11:44.865 --> 01:11:47.912
<i>He was responsible for bringing
fentanyl into the South End.</i>

707
01:11:47.912 --> 01:11:51.568
<i>Come on.
Pick up the phone... Come on.</i>

708
01:11:51.568 --> 01:11:53.613
<i>Ducky's not
getting away with this shit.</i>

709
01:11:54.397 --> 01:11:57.269
<i>We think he and Michael might
have been in business together.</i>

710
01:11:57.835 --> 01:12:00.359
<i>Maybe there was a dispute
or something.</i>

711
01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:02.579
<i>I can't expect you
to pick up this time.</i>

712
01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:05.495
<i>There is something I want
to tell you in person.</i>

713
01:12:06.409 --> 01:12:08.149
<i>Okay. Mom...</i>

714
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:10.413
<i>Listen. you've got
to be careful with that girl.</i>

715
01:12:10.413 --> 01:12:11.979
<i>...I love you
so much.</i>

716
01:12:11.979 --> 01:12:13.677
<i>Bye.</i>

717
01:12:13.677 --> 01:12:15.200
<i>You know
who called him. Paige.</i>

718
01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:17.507
<i>It was Ducky.</i>

719
01:12:17.507 --> 01:12:19.465
<i>We checked his phone.</i>

720
01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:52.150
Hi.

721
01:12:52.803 --> 01:12:54.021
She's sleeping.

722
01:12:56.633 --> 01:12:58.025
You feeling okay. Mom?

723
01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.161
No. Not really.

724
01:13:06.686 --> 01:13:07.905
Wow.

725
01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:10.124
Haven't seen this thing
in years.

726
01:13:11.778 --> 01:13:14.433
This was dad's nicest suitcase.

727
01:13:15.826 --> 01:13:18.306
They covered it
in fucking stickers.

728
01:13:23.616 --> 01:13:25.183
The stuff's in there.

729
01:13:32.495 --> 01:13:34.410
You think that's
what killed her?

730
01:13:41.852 --> 01:13:43.419
Yeah. it seems like it.

731
01:13:47.727 --> 01:13:49.686
They both had fentanyl in them.

732
01:13:54.038 --> 01:13:55.343
Seriously. Mom.

733
01:13:55.866 --> 01:13:57.433
You should go see a doctor.

734
01:14:00.914 --> 01:14:02.742
Yeah... I will.

735
01:14:05.789 --> 01:14:07.617
Okay. I tried.

736
01:14:21.282 --> 01:14:22.370
Okay.

737
01:17:29.993 --> 01:17:32.517
Thank you.
I told you.

744
01:20:56.895 --> 01:21:00.203
Remember when Mike threw
that perfect game...

745
01:21:01.595 --> 01:21:03.162
...until the final inning...

746
01:21:04.294 --> 01:21:06.078
...and then he gave it up
to them?

747
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:13.738
That was just his luck.

748
01:21:16.828 --> 01:21:18.874
I didn't mean for any of this
to happen.

749
01:21:21.398 --> 01:21:23.269
It was supposed to be simple.

750
01:21:25.489 --> 01:21:28.231
When Mike found out
what was in it.

751
01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:30.320
he wouldn't sell it
or give it back.

752
01:21:31.277 --> 01:21:33.279
What did he think
they were going to do?

753
01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.239
I guess that's my luck.

754
01:21:37.457 --> 01:21:39.982
This doesn't have anything
to do with luck.

755
01:21:41.592 --> 01:21:43.289
I'm scared. Mom.

756
01:21:50.993 --> 01:21:52.081
Me too.

760

761
01:22:59.148 --> 01:23:01.367
<i>But Michael had something different...</i>

762
01:23:01.367 --> 01:23:02.803
<i>he had an arm.</i>

763
01:23:02.803 --> 01:23:04.327
Oh. just water for me.

764
01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:08.026
<i>He threw 70 miles per hour
by 14.</i>

765
01:23:08.026 --> 01:23:10.768
<i>The scouts started telling us
he had a real shot.</i>

766
01:23:11.769 --> 01:23:14.032

of damage he was doing</i>

767

768

769
01:23:20.734 --> 01:23:22.954

770
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:27.089

wouldn't be totally true...</i>

771
01:23:27.089 --> 01:23:28.699
Thanks.

772
01:23:28.699 --> 01:23:31.180
<i>...but I knew a kid shouldn't
be in that much pain.</i>

773
01:23:34.052 --> 01:23:36.402
<i>Then. I started seeing
his behaviour changing.</i>

774
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:40.711
<i>Toby was a different story.</i>

775
01:23:40.711 --> 01:23:42.974
<i>He was the one we didn't have
to worry about...</i>

776
01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:46.412
<i>...the civil servant.

777
01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:50.373
<i>That might be the only thing
I still recognize in him.</i>

778
01:23:50.373 --> 01:23:52.679
<i>that toxic ambition.</i>

779
01:23:54.681 --> 01:23:56.988
<i>As different as Mike
and Toby were.</i>

780
01:23:56.988 --> 01:23:58.555
<i>their lives stayed intertwined</i>

781
01:23:58.555 --> 01:24:00.470
<i>more than they could
ever let me know.</i>

782
01:24:11.655 --> 01:24:14.223
I assume you know
the implications of this.

783
01:24:17.487 --> 01:24:19.315
I know more than anyone.

784
01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.493
Take a couple of days...

785
01:24:24.146 --> 01:24:26.061
...a week. whatever.

786
01:24:29.586 --> 01:24:33.894
Take that time and if then.

787
01:24:33.894 --> 01:24:38.421
you still want to publish it.
I'll have your back.

788
01:24:54.741 --> 01:24:56.047
It's good.

789
01:25:28.427 --> 01:25:30.168
Thanks for letting us
have her for the day.

790
01:25:31.082 --> 01:25:32.257
Can I take her?

791
01:25:34.651 --> 01:25:36.479
Hello. baby!

792
01:25:37.175 --> 01:25:39.134
Hello. baby!

793
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:42.180
Are we going to have
some fun today?

794
01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.921
Oh. yeah.

795
01:25:43.921 --> 01:25:45.618
Thanks. Mom.
See you later.

796
01:25:46.184 --> 01:25:47.490
Oh!

797
01:25:51.407 --> 01:25:52.799
Let's do it!

798
01:25:52.799 --> 01:25:54.149
