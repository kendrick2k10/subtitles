8
00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.248
- Greetings. oh masterful one.

9
00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.250
I am but a lowly minion
sitting here before you

10
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.753
crisscross applesauce.
consummately at your

11
00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:56.890
infernal service and forever
in your eternal debt.

12
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.358
I dunno.

13
00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:01.194
My name is Marcus J.
Trillbury. but my friends.

14
00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:06.199
my many. many friends call
me Onyx the Fortuitous.

15
00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.902
slayer of the bright realm.

16
00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.271
I dunno.

17
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.806
I have been a devilish devotee
of yours

18
00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.407
for more years than I can
count.

19
00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.943
I have purchased all of your
books.

20
00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:18.945
Huh. Interesting.

21
00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:21.414
Listened to all of your
records.

22
00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.917
And even attempted to complete
your at-home workout regime.

23
00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.052
"The Beelzebub Beef Up."

24
00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:28.221
But most importantly. I've
been a diligent student

25
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.256
of your teachings. having
completed the online

26
00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.559
certification process for
Letting a Lil Devil In.

27
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:35.395
levels 101. 201. and 301.

28
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.997
And I was approved for
401. but my mom said

29
00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.200
I had to stop spending money
on the internet. full stop.

30
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.202
And yes. that did include
bidding on rare

31
00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.871
Battle K.A.T.T.S. minifigs.
even though last summer I was

32
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.774
this close to winning a
glow-in-the-dark. ultra blue

33
00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:51.744
pumaman variant. Goddamn. I
wanted that minifig so bad.

34
00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:54.314
So when I heard. oh Lord. that
you were running a contest

35
00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:56.749
for five of your most devoted
followers to take part

36
00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.019
in a once-in-a-lifetime demonic
ritual with you in person.

37
00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.856
I just knew it was my destiny
to attend.

38
00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.658
For I am the most devoted
of darkened disciples.

39
00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.494
the most fiery of fervent
fanatics.

40
00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.829
and the most perpetuitous
of putrid pupils.

41
00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:13.967
I guess the only thing left
to say is.

42
00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.202
notice me. Senpai. notice me!
(door bangs)

43
00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.670
Oh. God. Mom.
- What the hell

44
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.705
are you doing in here?
- I told you I was making

45
00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:19.839
a video.
- Are those my dolls?

46
00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.040
- They're for the video
- Did you

47
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.242
rip my dolls' heads off?
- I promise I'll put

48
00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.776
them back. but you can't take
them now.

49
00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:26.646
You'll disrupt the magick!
You'll disrupt the magick!

50
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.382

51
00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:37.323

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:45.098
(computer keys clacking)

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.877

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:01.981

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:14.093
(fork thudding)

58
00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:20.066
- [Todd] Oh my God. (laughing)

59
00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.107
- Did you put everything
back where you found it?

60
00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:29.409
- Yes. Mom.

61
00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.512
- Even Holly Little Puddin'
Pants?

62
00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.547
- Even Holly Little Puddin'
Pants. Woo!

63
00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.518
- Where you headed? You
don't work on Fridays.

64
00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:40.320
- Oh. thanks for invading
my privacy. Todd.

65
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.821
You don't know me.

66
00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:43.590
Hard truth is Travis was fired
for pissin in the sweet tea tank

67
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.726
for the third time this month.
so I'm picking up his shift.

68
00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.829
- All right. then. What
time can I expect you home?

69
00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.898
Would you like us to save you
some dinner?

70
00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.200
- Oh. nah. Nah. nah. nah. nah.
nah.

71
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.069
I might be out pretty late.
actually.

72
00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.871
- (belches) Wow. Big plans
after work.

73
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.808
Plans so big that we
shouldn't save you dinner.

74
00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:04.377
- Yeah. actually. Todd. (laughs)
me and some of my friends

75
00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:06.913
might just go out and tear
around town. you know.

76
00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:10.016
flipping stuff up and
ripping stuff down. (laughs)

77
00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:11.818
- Oh. fun.

78
00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:13.753
- (scoffs) Yeah. That'll be
the day.

79
00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:14.988
- What's that?

80
00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.023
- Hey. if you got so many
friends.

81
00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:19.859
how about I. uh. save a spot
for 'em at the table. right?

82
00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.695
That way they can all join us
for dinner. all your friends!

83
00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:24.697
- Why do you wear a full suit
and tie every goddamn day.

84
00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:26.199
Todd. you sell
wholesale buckets

85
00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.534
of doomsday mac and cheese
over the phone.

86
00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:31.938
- Because the clothes
define the man. Marcus.

87
00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.873
Clearly a lesson you could
stand to learn.

88
00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:36.175
- I told you not to
call me Marcus anymore.

89
00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:38.444
My name is Onyx the
Fortuitous. and I'm proud

90
00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.580
of what we accomplish at
the Meat Hut every day.

91
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.982
- Boys! Boys! (sighs)

92
00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:45.151
You two have been family
for over a year now.

93
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:49.622
and I will not tolerate these
yelling matches anymore.

94
00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.958
Marcus. I could understand if
your father

95
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.427
was still in the house. but
this is Todd.

96
00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:57.063
your stepfather. and my lover.

97
00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:58.598
- Ugh.

98
00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:01.801
- Now. I want you two to
breathe with me. okay?

99
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:06.272
Breathe in. (inhales)

100
00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.841
(Nancy exhales)
- Fuck you. Todd.

101
00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:09.776
- Good. In.

102
00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:14.280
And out.

103
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.983
- Fuck you. Onyx the
Fart-uitous.

104
00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.954
- Fuck you. Todd!
- Fuck you. Marcus!

105
00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:23.289
- Boys!
(microwave dings)

106
00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.892
(bright music)

107
00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:30.530
(bell dings)
- Order up. number 46.

108
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.865
Hold the slaw. extra slaw.
prairie pepper hot sauce

109
00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:35.101
on the side with a slap of
pickles.

110
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.704
(upbeat music)

111
00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:43.843
Ah. ah. ah. ah.

112
00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:46.179
Check the weight on that.

113
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:50.316
You're one fry short.

114
00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:52.885
(bright music)

115
00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:03.696

116
00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.367
Cash run. Derrell.
Low on fives.

117
00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:17.643
(computer game beeping)

118
00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.081
Um. Masha?

119
00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:24.350
- What. Marcus? Fuck!

120
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.686
- I was just wondering if you
got my new name tag in yet.

121
00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.187
- Your what?

122
00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:30.456
- Remember a few weeks ago
I requested a new name tag.

123
00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:32.592
one that read Onyx the
Fortuitous?

124
00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:34.927
I even applied for one through
corporate and everything.

125
00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:37.363
- That's not your name.

126
00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:40.800
- Oh. yeah. uh. um. well.
this one's not my name either.

127
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.669
because my name is Marcus
Trillbury. yeah.

128
00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.606
but this says
Marquay Dickberry.

129
00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:48.107
And it's been like that since
day one.

130
00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:49.375
I've been here six years.

131
00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.310
- Look. if you want a
different name tag.

132
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.246
check the junk box.

133
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.384
(computer game beeping)

134
00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:00.319
- You lose.
- Oh. fuck!

135
00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.189
Fuck. fuck. fuck me in my
dirty cunt!

136
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.459
(drawer bangs)

137
00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:07.827
- Oh. God!

138
00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.362
- What's up. Pussyhound?

139
00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:14.000
- What's up. Tanner.
Tanner's bois?

140
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.004
(Tanner's bois barking)

141
00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.106
How can I make your day a
bit beefier?

142
00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.641
- (sucks teeth) Yeah. we're
gonna need 12

143
00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:24.277
Beefy Bad Boy meals.
Monster Style curly fries.

144
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.446
I'm gonna need some sodas for
my hounds.

145
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.215
And you know-
(Boi whispers indistinctly)

146
00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:32.685
Yeah. and a Sweet N' Sugary
Strawberry Shimmy Shake.

147
00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:36.522
and Vanilla Bean Cream Supreme.
mixed.

148
00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.892
- Is that all?
- No.

149
00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:43.863
I want a Peter Plumpkin
Toaster Pie. but slightly cool.

150
00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:46.766
I don't want it to be too
hot for my baby mouth.

151
00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:51.804
Hey. it's free in five on
Fridays. right?

152
00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:53.506
- Yes. sir.

153
00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:57.877
- Well then you better
hop to it.

154
00:07:57.877 --> 00:08:01.814
(Tanner's bois laugh)

155
00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:04.417
(upbeat music)

156
00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:13.392
(upbeat music continues)

157
00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:18.664
- There you are. Tanner.
Tanner's bois.

158
00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.600
(Tanner's bois bark)

159
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.034
We're just waiting on
the burgers.

160
00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:23.002
- Time's almost up.

161
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.371
(Tanner's bois bark)

162
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:27.573
- Hurry. hurry. patty slinger.

163

Gross.

164
00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:31.344
- [Tanner] Uh. uh. uh. uh. uh.

165
00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:35.648
- When in doubt. skewer it out.

166

(upbeat music)

167
00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:44.423

three. two. one.

170
00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.969
Uh-uh. times up.

171
00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:58.271
- But I-
- Lean in.

172
00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:00.673
Lean in. Come on.

173
00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:13.319

176
00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:25.131
(Tanner's bois barking)

177
00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:26.299
Patty slinger.

178
00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:32.104
- Tell Masha I quit!
- What?

179
00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:33.606
- Tell Masha I quit!

180
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.711

182
00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:50.523
- Dear God.

183
00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:52.658
Or the devil.

184

Whichever one's listening.
I guess. (sobs)

185
00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:00.700
Um. I was wondering

186
00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:03.970
if maybe he could give
me a different life.

187
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.742
Yeah. different than the one
I have right now currently.

188
00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:14.246
(gentle music)

189
00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:18.384
Yeah. I'd really like a
different life. please.

190
00:10:20.753 --> 00:10:22.822
'Cause this one's not working
out so well.

Bartok's mansion

to take part in a
once-in-a-lifetime ritual

204
00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:04.196
in which he. along with five
of his most loyal followers.

205
00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:05.398
will attempt to raise
the spirit

206
00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:06.899
of the ancient demon. Abaddon.

207
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.770
- That's nice. dear. but
you're not going anywhere

208
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.405
until you scoop that
litter box.

209
00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:18.377
(litter rustling)

210
00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:23.082

213
00:11:37.296 --> 00:11:40.866

- Ah. Briardale Manor.
Bartok's estate. Astounding.

219
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.996
Truly a sight to behold.

220
00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:12.631
- It's the kind of house
that makes you wanna recreate

221
00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:14.800
the 1993 Michael Bay directed
music video

222
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.336
for Meat Loaf's "I'd
Do Anything for Love."

223
00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:21.107
I dunno. But I won't do that.

224
00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:25.311
(Mack giggles)
- How do we get in?

225
00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:29.415
- Oh! Let's explore.
(giggles)

226
00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:32.051
- This is wonderful.
(Shelley laughing)

227
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:35.721
Carpe diem. (laughs)

228
00:12:35.721 --> 00:12:39.525
- I'm Mackenzie. You can
call me Mack. or Zee.

229
00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:42.728
- Oh. cool. my name is Marcus.
but. uh-

230
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.364
- But...

231
00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:50.469
- I'd really love it if you
called me Onyx the Fortuitous.

232
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.540
- Sounds good. Nice to meet
you. Onyx.

233
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:57.777
- Nice to meet you. Zee.

234
00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:01.747
(cheery music)

235
00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:07.787
- Ooh. wowy. wowy.
wowy. wowy!

236
00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.389
(cheery music)

237
00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:16.662
(gasps) Oh. Ah.

238
00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:20.032
♪ Emerald is my favorite ♪

239
00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:20.866
- Peridot.

240
00:13:22.401 --> 00:13:23.969
- Pardon me?

241
00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:25.471
- Oh. it's peridot.

242
00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:28.974
Emerald tends to have a
deeper. more verdant hue.

243
00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:33.979
whereas peridot is lighter
and more olive-colored.

244
00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:37.950
- I love that you know that.
Power in knowledge. eh?

245
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.119
- Yeah.
(both laugh)

246
00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:41.654
- There's a note.
- (gasps) Ooh!

247
00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:44.990
(Shelley laughs and
clears throat)

248
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.493
"A warm welcome to the
most devoted

249
00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.795
and devout of Bartok's
betrothed.

250
00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:55.434
These necklaces are to cleanse
you of any unwelcome spirits

251
00:13:55.434 --> 00:13:59.071
before you enter this
sacred and unholy space.

252
00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:02.641
Please place a personal item
in the box.

253
00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:05.177
Leaving this item will help
ground you to the house

254
00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:08.681
and act as an offering of
familiarity.

255
00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:11.383
Once you have left your
item. please. each of you

256
00:14:11.383 --> 00:14:15.287
place a crystal around your
neck and step into the foyer."

(Onyx breathing heavily)

258
00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:22.294
(whimsical music)

259
00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:27.299
- Mm-mm.
(whimsical music)

260
00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:33.939
Mm-mm.
(whimsical music)

261
00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:42.548
Ah.

262
00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:46.485
- Is that the only luggage
you brought?

263
00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:47.887
- It's got everything I need.

264
00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.723
(whimsical music)

265
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.494

(all laughing)

268
00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.514
Did y'all see that?
- Yes.

269
00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:17.049
- Did everyone see that
little shimmer thing?

270
00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:18.884
(laughs) That's tight.

271
00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:22.254
(laughs) That's tight.

272
00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:24.723
(chiming music)
(Onyx gasps)

273
00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:27.326
(door squeaks)

274
00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:33.565
- Come on.
(person giggles)

275
00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:37.336
- What? No way.
- Oh. dear God.

276
00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:40.039
(dramatic music)

277
00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:43.008
(body thuds)

278
00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:43.943
- Oh. fuck!

279
00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:47.947
(TV crackles)

280
00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:51.116
- I hate to disappoint
you all.

281
00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:56.121
my oh so loyal followers.
but I am dead.

282
00:15:57.589 --> 00:15:58.557
Dead as a doornail.

283
00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:03.462
This is not a trick or
an illusion.

284
00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:07.333
Go ahead. check my pulse.
I'll wait.

285
00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:09.835
(eerie music)

286
00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:23.849
What this is. is your
first test.

287
00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:29.488
a test of faith. one that
can bring me back to life.

288
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:36.428
So if you have faith in me
now. show it.

289
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.632
Speak it with me now with
hearts full of faith!

290
00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.737
Let him rise!

291
00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:45.838
Let him rise!

292
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:51.643
- [All] Let him rise!
Let him rise!

293
00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:53.879
Let him rise! Let him rise!

294
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.416
Let him rise! Let him rise!

295
00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:01.653
Let him rise! Let him rise!

296
00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:07.793
(fire crackles)
(Bartok gasps)

297
00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.228
- [Onyx] Huh? Oh!

298
00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:13.098
(dramatic music)

299
00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:27.980
(blood squelching)
(all gasp)

300
00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:33.519
(knife clatters)

301
00:17:34.853 --> 00:17:37.022
- What do I see before me?

302
00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:45.764
Children. ancient beings.
ideas.

303
00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:50.069
Atoms.

304
00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:55.407
But what are you really?

305
00:17:56.809 --> 00:18:01.346
Do you even know what
you are?

306
00:18:03.682 --> 00:18:04.850
Have no fear.

307
00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:11.123
This weekend you will take
part in three rituals.

308
00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:17.329
the first two in preparation
for the third and final.

309
00:18:18.197 --> 00:18:21.667
the ritual of Abaddon Rising.

310
00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:25.170
And in that ritual under
a blood moon.

311
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.108
all of you shall be renewed

312
00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.777
as disciples in his name.

313
00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:36.782
disciples of Abaddon with
renewed purpose.

314
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.287
knowledge. power. and yes.
my children. immortality!

315
00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:45.390
- Nice.
- Schwa?

316
00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:48.927
(all laughing)

317
00:18:50.095 --> 00:18:54.800
- Tonight. drink and eat

318
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.969
in communion with one another.

319
00:18:56.969 --> 00:19:00.205
Make merry and rest.

320
00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:06.078
For tomorrow. you will
take the first steps

321
00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:07.112
towards your rebirth.

322
00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:12.918
(all laughing)

323
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.787
- [Onyx] Thank you. Bartok!

324
00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:19.091
(all clapping)
- Outstanding.

325
00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:21.693
(all laughing)

326
00:19:30.702 --> 00:19:34.306
(glass clinking)

327
00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:37.109
May I. uh. break the
proverbial ice. as it were.

328
00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:39.878
and ask what led each of
you to Lucifer

329
00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:41.613
and the teachings of Bartok?

330
00:19:41.613 --> 00:19:42.881
- Fuck. is that absinthe?

331
00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:46.752
- Well. why don't you start.
Mr. Duke?

332
00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:48.120
Break that proverbial ice.

333
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.821
- Oh. well. I'd be delighted.

334
00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:51.857
My name is John Duke.

335
00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.560
I'm a teacher. so I'm used
to being called Mr. Duke.

336
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.429
and that is just fine by me.

337
00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:59.965
I'm a man of literature and
languages.

338
00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:03.202
I've studied many religions
and theologies over the years.

339
00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:04.870
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

340
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.905
- In the Christian Bible.

341
00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:10.576
man is punished for seeking
knowledge.

342
00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:14.279
In the garden of Eden. the
closer you get to the devil.

343
00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:17.349
the closer you get to
the truth.

344
00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:20.419
And I believe that Bartok
hears the truth

345
00:20:20.419 --> 00:20:23.055
directly from Lucifer.

346
00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:27.993
And truth. ah. truth is
what I seek above all.

347
00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:30.862
- I'll go next. (giggles)

348
00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:32.331
Mine is quick.

349
00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:36.702
Um. I actually have a poem
memorized that tells my story.

350
00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:38.437
- Oh. cool.

351
00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:44.276
(Shelley clears throat)

352
00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:49.715
There was a young woman
who worshiped the Lord.

353
00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:52.751
In church every Sunday.
her God she adored.

354
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:55.587
She would help run the
service collect all the tithes.

355
00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:58.857
her husband and children
always by her side.

356
00:20:58.857 --> 00:21:02.127
She was taught that a
Christian's work isn't in vain.

357
00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:05.864
She hoped serving Jesus
might shield her from pain.

358
00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:10.002
Then one day she got word
that her husband had perished.

359
00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:12.638
taken by a drunk driver
in a flash.

360
00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:15.674
All she cherished was
broken and twisted up

361
00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:17.609
in shards of metal.

362
00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:20.145
That young woman in her grief

363
00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:25.150
took solace in the devil.

364
00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:28.253
(somber music)

365
00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:31.256
Thank you.

366
00:21:33.325 --> 00:21:36.194
- Your husband died. so you
started worshiping the devil?

367
00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:40.232
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I get it.

368
00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:41.600
It's like that one time
in middle school.

369
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.435
I asked out my crush.
Rebekah Love Rodriguez.

370
00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:44.970
and she told me to
go suck an egg.

371
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.405
So I just listened to the
"Phantom of the Opera"

372
00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:48.040
soundtrack for weeks.

373
00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:50.208
- Oh.

374
00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:53.879
- Well. what brought you
to Bartok. Marcus. hmm?

375
00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:56.815
What started you down this
lighted path that led you here?

376
00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:01.320
- Mine's a pretty darkened
tale as well. I dunno.

377
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.821
So I might need a little
something. something

378
00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:04.756
to loosen up the tongue to
spin this tortured yarn.

379
00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:06.625
- You want some of that?
- Oh. nah. nah. nah. nah.

380
00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:08.026
Nah. nah. nah. nah. nah. nah.

381
00:22:09.194 --> 00:22:11.363
Dangerous personality
types run in my family.

382
00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:13.065
so I've gotta be very
intentional when it comes

383
00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:15.600
to my libatious intake.
I dunno.

384
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.235
I stick to my tiny wines.

385
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.245
Mama always said. "Too mooch
juice and the beast gets loose."

386
00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:30.048
(laughs) But I just need
enough to get my courage up.

387
00:22:30.048 --> 00:22:32.984
(objects rustling)

388
00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:43.795
(objects continue rustling)

389
00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:47.599
(gentle music)

390
00:22:57.142 --> 00:23:00.345
(Onyx exhales shakily)

391
00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:03.148
I was eight years old when
my father left.

392
00:23:03.148 --> 00:23:04.916
That weekend. my mama
took me to the flea market

393
00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:07.986
and gave me five bucks to
spend on anything I wanted.

394
00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:10.655
I dunno. to help
keep my mind off things.

395
00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:13.692
At first. I saw a Cabbage
Patch Doll with my name on it.

396
00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:16.762
Hooey. that doll was
something fierce.

397
00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:18.463
Spotted freckles. (laughs)

398
00:23:18.463 --> 00:23:21.199
A little twist of red
yarn hair.

399
00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:23.802
Goddamn. it was a sight
to behold.

400
00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:27.172
And I always did think I'd
be a daddy to a ginger.

401
00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:28.006
- Oh.

402
00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:30.742
- But just before I handed
that fine doll seller

403
00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:33.111
my crispy Lincoln. I saw it.
one rack over

404
00:23:33.111 --> 00:23:35.414
behind a Lou Ferrigno
Christmas album.

405
00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:37.716
Bartok's first record.

406
00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:41.887
- Ah. "The Devil's Due."
- "The Devil's Due."

407
00:23:41.887 --> 00:23:45.891
I don't know what made me buy
it. Curiosity. compulsion?

408
00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:46.725
- Fate.

409
00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:48.593
- Mayhaps. Mayhaps.

410
00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:51.830
It also might have been
the goatee.

411
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.065
Ever since ALF. I've had
an obsession with hair.

412
00:23:54.065 --> 00:23:58.370
both body and facial. wanting
more of it. wanting less.

413
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.072
Having too mooch.
but never enoof.

414
00:24:01.072 --> 00:24:02.641
ALF's real name is
Gordon Shumway.

415
00:24:02.641 --> 00:24:05.076
- Can you finish your
story? Bartok. the record.

416
00:24:05.076 --> 00:24:06.611
- Oh. yeah. so I bought
the record. took it home.

417
00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.947
listened to it a bunch.
been a big fan ever since.

418
00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:12.050
- Oh. beautiful. (laughs)

419
00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:14.953
What about you. Jesminder?

420
00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:16.721
Oh. come on.

421
00:24:16.721 --> 00:24:20.392
The harder the shell.
the deeper the crack.

422
00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:21.393
Oh. Oh.

423
00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:27.165
- I am Jesminder. You can
call me Jesminder. not Jess.

424
00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:30.035
I am a tattoo artist
from Vegas.

425
00:24:30.035 --> 00:24:32.737
and do not ask me how many
tattoos I have.

426
00:24:32.737 --> 00:24:34.973
The question is rote
and basic.

427
00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.508
- Yeah.

428
00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:39.611
- My reason for being here
is different.

429
00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:44.182
I was Bartok's wife in a
past life.

430
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.453
many past lives actually. and
I'm here to be with him again.

431
00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:52.624
We have already died a
thousand deaths together.

432
00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:56.261
and I would die a thousand
more just to be here now.

433
00:24:57.529 --> 00:25:00.532
I'm here for him. and not
to make merry.

434
00:25:00.532 --> 00:25:02.334
and not to mince words.

435
00:25:04.135 --> 00:25:06.905
- Oh. yeah. no. I don't
think you are mincing words.

436
00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:08.306
I dunno.

437
00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:09.708
- Why do you. why do you
keep saying that?

438
00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:10.542
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

439
00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:14.980
- I dunno.

440
00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.951
- (laughs) Well. I'm Mack.
they/them.

441
00:25:21.152 --> 00:25:24.289
And feel free to ask me
how many tattoos I have.

442
00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:26.791
The answer's 12. My
favorite's Snoopy on my ankle.

443
00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:29.394
- Oh. I love Snoopy.
- Oh. me too.

444
00:25:29.394 --> 00:25:34.065
- And much like Mr. Duke. I'm
an investigator. a seeker.

445
00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:36.301
I believe in the power of
the elements.

446
00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:38.637
the natural elements.

447
00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:43.408
Bartok. I came across in high
school. consumed all his work.

448
00:25:43.408 --> 00:25:46.578
Through him. I've come to
learn more about myself

449
00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:49.548
and my place in the
world around me.

450
00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:52.050
(lips pop)

451
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:55.220
- (chuckles) Wow. Will
you look at us. huh?

452
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.156
Five individuals from
differing backgrounds

453
00:25:58.156 --> 00:26:02.561
in various walks of life.
all assembled here. now.

454
00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:05.630
to take part in
something extraordinary

455
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.900
and unprecedented
in his unholy name.

456
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.969
(chuckles) Cheers to that.

457
00:26:10.969 --> 00:26:12.737
- To immortality!

458
00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.973
- [All] To immortality!

459
00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:18.243
- [Onyx] To immortality!
(all laugh)

460
00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:22.080
(voices echoing indistinctly)

461
00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:26.251
I'm so happy to be here
in Bartok's mansion.

462
00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:31.923
- [Mr. Duke] So. Onyx. Onyx.
tell me more about this ALF.

463
00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:35.727
- [Onyx] Yeah. so ALF's
real name is Gordon Shumway.

464
00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:37.495
- Where is he from?
- Yeah. well. he's from

465
00:26:37.495 --> 00:26:40.632
the planet Melmac.
but he crash lands-

466
00:26:40.632 --> 00:26:44.302
- [Attendee] And then
I chopped my hair off.

467
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.172
- Well. what do you see?

468
00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:53.945
(eerie music)
(all laughing)

469
00:26:55.847 --> 00:26:58.617
- The chubby one didn't drink.
- What?

470
00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:03.755
The patty slinger?
Can't you make him?

471
00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:06.224
- It doesn't really work that
way. They have to be willing.

472
00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:10.328
- Well. what of everyone else?

473
00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:12.464
- Everything seems to
be going as planned.

474
00:27:13.298 --> 00:27:14.165
- Seems?

475
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.935
You don't sound so sure.

476
00:27:17.936 --> 00:27:18.770
- I-

477
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.939
(all laughing)

478
00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:23.041
- Do we have anything to
worry about?

479
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:24.776
Is the ritual going to work?

480
00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:28.413
(dramatic music)

481
00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:31.249
- No.

482
00:27:31.249 --> 00:27:33.251
- No. the ritual won't work?

483
00:27:33.251 --> 00:27:35.086
- No. we have nothing to
worry about.

484
00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:40.925
- Good. Then we move forward.

485
00:27:42.193 --> 00:27:45.296
Tomorrow you will guide them

486
00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:50.268
through the first ritual.
"The Book of Blood."

487
00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:54.406
This will quell any
uncertainty

488
00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:58.877
and lead us one step
closer to the talisman.

489
00:27:58.877 --> 00:28:01.579
(ethereal music)

490
00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:06.084
(birds chirping)

491
00:28:06.084 --> 00:28:07.485
(microphone squealing)

492
00:28:07.485 --> 00:28:11.056
Good morning. Marcus. Jesminder.
John. Shelley. and Mack.

493
00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:13.758
This is a reminder to please
wear your cleansing stones

494
00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:16.795
at all times during your
stay at Briardale Manor.

495
00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:19.364
After your meal. we will
meet in the ritual room

496
00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:22.701
with full bellies. steady
hearts. and willing spirits.

497
00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:27.405
(microphone squeals)

498
00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:30.175
(dramatic music)

499
00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:34.312
(Shelley giggles)

500
00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:40.218
(door clangs)

501
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.658
Good morning. all.

502
00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:49.027
I am Farrah.
delegate to Bartok.

503
00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:50.762
servant to our great
Lord Lucifer.

504
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.432
This is the Grand Grimoire.

505
00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:56.134
(all gasp)

506
00:28:56.134 --> 00:28:56.968
- Oh.

507
00:28:57.836 --> 00:28:59.137
What's that?

508
00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:01.005
- It's like the devil's bible.

509
00:29:01.005 --> 00:29:04.209
- All the unholy knowledge
in the world

510
00:29:04.209 --> 00:29:08.046
bound in the skin of
fallen angels.

511
00:29:09.147 --> 00:29:10.482
- Sick.

512
00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:13.051
- You were not chosen
at random.

513
00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:16.721
The souls required to perform
the ritual of Abaddon Rising

514
00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:19.724
were called out a
millennia ago by this book.

515
00:29:21.192 --> 00:29:24.195
You will each need to bleed
on the primary sigil. here.

516
00:29:24.195 --> 00:29:25.663
The book will tell me
whether or not

517
00:29:25.663 --> 00:29:27.265
you have a rightful place.

518
00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:32.670
Who would like to
approach first?

519
00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:34.806
- Let's do this.

520
00:29:37.475 --> 00:29:39.377
I know my place.

521
00:29:39.377 --> 00:29:40.979
- Your hand.

522
00:29:40.979 --> 00:29:45.283
(dramatic music)
Et In Nomine Tuo.

523
00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:48.052
(dramatic music)

524
00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.161
Next.

525
00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:59.564
(attendee gasps)
(dramatic music)

526
00:29:59.564 --> 00:30:02.700
(Marcus whimpers)

527
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.136
- Mm. ow! Fuck. fuck. fuck.

528
00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:08.206
Ow. fuck. Fuck. fuck.
fuck. fuck. fuck. mm.

529
00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:09.374
- The book. Marcus.

530
00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:13.211
- Mm. How many squeezes?

531
00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.712
How many squeezes?
- That. that's enough.

532
00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:15.547
That's enough.

533
00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:21.319
(Farrah whispers indistinctly)

534
00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:24.088
(dramatic music)

535
00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:34.933
Yes.

536
00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:36.668
- What does it mean?

537
00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:39.804
- You have royal blood
dating back generations.

538
00:30:39.804 --> 00:30:43.174
You are the queen.
And you are allowed.

539
00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:44.142
- I knew it.

540
00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:50.715
(Shelley gasps)

541
00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:51.950
- The viking.

542
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:52.917
- Wow. What?

543
00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:57.555
- You exist within an
ancient Nordic bloodline

544
00:30:57.555 --> 00:31:00.925
that flows forward and
backward from your family.

545
00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:02.560
You are allowed.

546
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.431
- Ooh. holy crap!
Can you believe it?

547
00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:10.068
I'm a Viking. y'all. (growls)

548
00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:15.073
(laughs) Up top. up top!
(laughs)

549
00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:27.051
- Leave it to our dark
father to surprise us.

550
00:31:27.051 --> 00:31:32.056
Turns out this polished. refined
man built of tweed and twee

551
00:31:33.524 --> 00:31:35.360
is also a werewolf.

552
00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:38.463
Lycanthrope blood pulses
through your veins.

553
00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.733
Whatever the amount and
however dormant it may be.

554
00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.534
it is still present nonetheless.

555
00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:46.437
And you are allowed.

556
00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:52.844
(dramatic music)

557
00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:56.114
A mystic. Spellcaster.

558
00:31:57.482 --> 00:32:00.351
The witch in this
lifetime and many others.

559
00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.488
- Really?
- You have great power.

560
00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:04.756
but you already knew that.

561
00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:06.724
Use it wisely.

562
00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:10.561
You. Mackenzie. are allowed.

563
00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:20.171
- Huh?

564
00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:23.708
- You are the virgin.
And you are allowed.

565
00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:25.476
- What the fuck?

566
00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:26.611
- You're just as an
important piece

567
00:32:26.611 --> 00:32:28.613
to this puzzle as anyone else.

568
00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:31.282
- Bullshit. Jesminder's
an ancient queen.

569
00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:33.051
Shelley found out
she's a viking.

570
00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:34.986
Oh. how cool and against
type is that?

571
00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:39.257
Mr. Duke is part fucking
werewolf. Are you kidding me?

572
00:32:39.257 --> 00:32:41.059
And Mack's an
all-too-powerful witch.

573
00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:43.628
but I'm just a fat fucking.
fat fucking virgin.

574
00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:49.100
Oh. goddamn. they did your
boy dirty.

575
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.970
- Well. are you a virgin?

576
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:53.604
- Huh?

577
00:32:53.604 --> 00:32:56.641
- Are you a virgin. Marcus?

578
00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:58.109
There's no shame in it.

579
00:32:58.109 --> 00:32:59.210
- Well. first of all.
Mr. Duke.

580
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.678
there is shame in everything.

581
00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:02.447
I'm surprised they didn't
teach you that in Yale school.

582
00:33:02.447 --> 00:33:04.849
And besides that. yes.
I am a virgin. goddamn.

583
00:33:04.849 --> 00:33:06.351
The only thing that's
ever touched my wee-wee

584
00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:08.619
is my never washed pair of
Battle K.A.T.T.S. Underoos.

585
00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:10.989
(book slams)

586
00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:13.157
- The point is. all is
in place

587
00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:15.426
for the ritual of
Abaddon Rising.

588
00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:18.296
a ritual that requires one
lycan. one witch. one viking.

589
00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:21.366
one queen. and yes.
one virgin.

590
00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:23.434
- Goddammit.

591
00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:26.237
- I must report my findings.
You will hear from me soon.

592
00:33:31.042 --> 00:33:32.543
- So you've never even...

593
00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:39.884
- What? No. (laughs)

594
00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:43.521
I mean. what would that
even do?

595
00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:48.593
(Onyx laughs)

596
00:33:52.964 --> 00:33:56.100
- Each are devoted.
each bled for you.

597
00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.168
All five are present.

598
00:33:59.637 --> 00:34:01.773
- They're all here. All five.

599
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.574
- All of them.

600
00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:07.178
We're so close. So close.

601
00:34:09.647 --> 00:34:10.915
- Open it.

602
00:34:10.915 --> 00:34:13.684
(dramatic music)

603
00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:19.991
Okay.

604
00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:26.030
Show me the way. Lord.

605
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.633
Show me the way to
the talisman.

606
00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:33.905
Show me the way to true power.

607
00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:38.276
Pay me back for all the years
of service. Show me the way!

608
00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:42.313
Show me the fucking way.

609
00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:48.419
Ooh.

610
00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:50.888
Ooh.

611
00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:56.094
Yes.

612
00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:58.229
Thank you. Father. (laughs)

613
00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:07.105
(dramatic music)

614
00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:13.611
Boom.

615
00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:19.117
Tonight. we capture

616
00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:22.787
eternity.

617
00:35:23.688 --> 00:35:26.424
(dramatic music)

618
00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:30.695
(crickets chirping)
(Shelley laughing)

619
00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:33.698
(Mr. Duke laughing)

620
00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:40.371
- So have you ever
like. transformed?

621
00:35:42.673 --> 00:35:44.308
- Never.

622
00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:48.646
I've never even imagined being
anything more than a man.

623
00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:52.116
Never even dreamt
it a possibility.

624
00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:54.652
That is until...

625
00:35:57.355 --> 00:35:59.524
- Until when?

626
00:35:59.524 --> 00:36:01.025
- I have kissed
somebody before.

627
00:36:01.025 --> 00:36:02.927
so I've lost my
mouth virginity.

628
00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:05.696
But I guess that's just not
enough for that stupid book.

629
00:36:07.064 --> 00:36:08.599
- I had a dream last night.

630
00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:12.236
And I believe it
was preparing me

631
00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:14.505
for what the Book of Blood
would reveal.

632
00:36:15.907 --> 00:36:20.912
In it. I. I saw my hands
growing claws.

633
00:36:23.948 --> 00:36:26.984
and my face. my face
covered in fur.

634
00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:32.089
I was inside of my own body.

635
00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:34.325
but somehow outside of
it as well.

636
00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:35.159
- Me too.

637
00:36:36.394 --> 00:36:37.995
I had a dream just like it.

638
00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:40.431
I mean. not the werewolf part.

639
00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:44.302
But it was a foreshadowing
of sorts.

640
00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:50.208
I was on the ocean in
a great. great big boat

641
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.046
surrounded by men.

642
00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.016
all looking to me for orders.

643
00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:02.119
- Sounds legit.

644
00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:04.822
- My friend Elijah thought
I got a hand job once

645
00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:06.424
from Kim Greene when we all
skipped school

646
00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:08.459
to go see a matinee of
"Ever After."

647
00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:10.061
I don't know. but in reality.

648
00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:12.096
Kim had just dropped a
piece of popcorn on my lap

649
00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:15.733
and had a wicked hard time
retrieving that rogue kernel.

650
00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:17.101
- I dreamt I was on a throne

651
00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:20.438
with an ever-expanding
army at my beck and call.

652
00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:25.676
A queen surveying many lands.

653
00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:33.050
- Oh. cool. well. I dreamt I
didn't fuck anybody last night.

654
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:36.087
so I guess we all had
pretty fortuitous dreams.

655
00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:39.023
(lighter clicking)

656
00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:45.863
(door clicking)

657
00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:50.301
(ominous music)

658
00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:55.706
- [Bartok] This way.
Stay close.

659
00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:56.841
- [Farrah] Yes. master.

660
00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:04.882
- Mack. did you have a
dream last night?

661
00:38:04.882 --> 00:38:05.716
- Who's asking?

662
00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:08.519
- Well. Mr. Duke's asking.

663
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.088
- Yeah. I. I. did.

664
00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:13.824
- You mind sharing?

665
00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:18.496
(Mack sighs)

666
00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:19.563
- I was a witch

667
00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:24.802
levitating above a
circle of other witches.

668
00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.973
all chanting my name
and lifting me up.

669
00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:33.978
- That's fucking tight too.

670
00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:36.180
Meanwhile. I slept like a
dumb-dumb baby.

671
00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.848
If I had a nightmare.
y'all'd know.

672
00:38:37.848 --> 00:38:40.084
I'd wake up gripping the
sheets something fierce

673
00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:41.252
and yelling. "Jesus!"

674
00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:43.087
- Interesting.

675
00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:47.958
We all. well. most of us.
had vivid dreams last night

676
00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:50.394
foretelling our callings
from the Book of Blood.

677
00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:53.731
But (sighs) what.
what does it mean?

678
00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:56.033
- How about this?

679
00:38:57.601 --> 00:39:02.173
We break into Bartok's study.
look at the Grimoire ourselves

680
00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:04.408
and find out what the
fuck it all means.

681
00:39:04.408 --> 00:39:05.843
- Schwa?

682
00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:08.579
- Well. Bartok and. uh. delegate
just left for the evening.

683
00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:11.115
I mean. I saw them go that way.

684
00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:12.950
Oh. come on. Mr. Duke.

685
00:39:14.318 --> 00:39:16.220
Think about all that juicy
knowledge

686
00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.055
that resides in that book.

687
00:39:18.055 --> 00:39:19.890
Don't you wanna sink
your little

688
00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.726
truth-seeking fangs into it?

689
00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:25.696
- I would die to know
more about that ritual.

690
00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:26.997
- Yes.

691
00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:29.533
- Tempted by the forbidden
fruit. huh?

692
00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:33.404
Dare we take a bite?

693
00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:35.506
- Dare we?

694
00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:39.810
(Mr. Duke and Onyx laugh)

695
00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:41.245
- Dare we?

696
00:39:41.245 --> 00:39:44.014
(dramatic music)

697
00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:47.218
(thunder crashes)

698
00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:49.987
(dramatic music)

699
00:39:55.292 --> 00:39:57.762

(Mr. Duke grunts)

702
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:06.537
Let me try.

703
00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:08.005
I've got a surprisingly
firm grip due to the amount

704
00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:10.341
of marshmallow fluff jars
I've opened up over the years.

705
00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:13.544
(laughs) I used to put
that shit on everything.

706
00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:17.381
(Onyx grunts)

707
00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:22.686
(dramatic music)

708
00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:24.688
- What? Are we close?

709
00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:28.092
- Yes. I think so.

710
00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:34.665
(Onyx grunts)

711
00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:37.401
- I'm talking English muffins.
I'm talking Pop-Tarts.

712
00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:41.038
Fuck. I'm even talking bean
burritos. I don't give a shit.

713
00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:42.239
(Onyx grunts)

714
00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:44.975
(dramatic music)

715
00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:55.619
- Here.

716
00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:59.390
The map says here.

717
00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:02.059
(dramatic music)

718
00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:07.031

724
00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:37.094
(Onyx panting)

725
00:41:38.896 --> 00:41:43.901
(thunder crashes)
(dramatic music)

726
00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:47.171
- Well. can anyone pick a lock?

727
00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:48.839
- Wait. my Meat Hut
skeleton key.

728
00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.741
- Your what?

729
00:41:50.741 --> 00:41:52.877
- This key opens everything.

730
00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:54.578
I inherited it from my former
boss. Rick.

731
00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:56.580
the night he quit the Meat
Hut. left me in charge.

732
00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.415
and promptly killed himself.

733
00:41:58.415 --> 00:42:00.818
I don't know. I think Rick's
wife might've left him.

734
00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:03.254
or maybe Rick never had a
wife at all.

735
00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:06.957
- Marcus. this lock is most
likely 200 years old or more.

736
00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:09.293
There is no way your
fast food key is gonna...

737
00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:12.596
Oh.
(Mack laughs)

738
00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:14.164
Oh. I stand corrected.

739
00:42:14.164 --> 00:42:16.934
(dramatic music)

740
00:42:21.805 --> 00:42:25.175
Unholy Father. how you
blessed us.

741
00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:28.879
- [Onyx] Oh.

742
00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.881
- There.

743
00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:33.984
- [Mack] The book.

744
00:42:33.984 --> 00:42:37.721
(Onyx imitates horn playing)

745
00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:42.526
(Onyx laughs)

746
00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:43.360
- Ah.

747
00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:48.732
- [Mr. Duke] Ah. here it is.
(laughs)

748
00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:50.868
- [Mack] Well. can you read it?

749
00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:52.803
- In. in. in pieces.

750
00:42:52.803 --> 00:42:54.638
It's written in an
ancient language

751
00:42:54.638 --> 00:42:58.943
I'm not entirely familiar
with. possibly Samarian or.

752
00:42:58.943 --> 00:43:00.811
or a derivative of such.

753
00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:04.515
I brought my compact mini
library of dead languages

754
00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:06.750
with me.
but they're in my room.

755
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.018
- Nerd.

756
00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:09.520
- [Onyx] What does it
say about the virgin?

757
00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.754
That he has the power to
cradle his flacid wee-wee

758
00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:12.656
in his hands and cry
for hours on end?

759
00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:16.327
- Ah. here it is.

760
00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:21.332
"The ritual of Abaddon
Rising is meant to empower.

- Oh. yes.

764
00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:42.987
- "But first. the Knife
of Dagon must be acquired.

765
00:43:42.987 --> 00:43:47.157
then the five devoted souls
must be..."

766
00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:49.793
- Must be what?

767
00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:52.262
- It. it. it's a word I'm
not entirely familiar with.

768
00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:56.100
Captivated? Enraptured?

769

present. the map of Sammael

00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:20.591

So if. if. if I'm to
understand this correctly.

784
00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.476
once Abaddon has risen-

785
00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:15.713

- Our immortality is gained.

kidding me?

- The what? The prophecy of
the what?

I don't know. it's gone.

(door creaking)

798
00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:56.120

expecting you.

- Welcome. my dear.

826
00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:18.962
Please. have a seat.

You know. you and I have
met many times

over thousands and
thousands of years.

830
00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:40.384
And it has all culminated
into this moment.

That's it.

844
00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:43.747
Give me all of you.
All of you.

Every last drop.

- Oh. hey. (laughs)

857
00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.349
What are y'all doing in here?

858
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:21.718
- Uh. Mr. Duke is just
trying to write down

859
00:50:21.718 --> 00:50:23.954
everything he can remember
from the book.

860
00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:25.989
We're trying to learn more
about the final ritual.

861
00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:28.458
- Oh. awesome. (chuckles)
Hell yeah.

862
00:50:29.626 --> 00:50:31.762
- Are you okay?

863
00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:34.831
- Ah. yeah. nah.
it's just. huh?

864
00:50:34.831 --> 00:50:37.667
What. how does that? Oh.
(laughs)

865
00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:39.202
There's a. I was wondering
how it.

866
00:50:39.202 --> 00:50:41.705
there's a little button
on the side so that. yeah.

867
00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:45.909
that just off and then back on
again. it's so cute. (laughs)

868
00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:49.846
Oh. I love the mechanics
of these vintage lamps.

869
00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:52.182
- Yeah. Onyx. you don't
really seem okay.

870
00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:54.117
Did something happen to you?

871
00:50:54.117 --> 00:50:56.520
- No. I just. (laughs)

872
00:50:58.388 --> 00:50:59.189
Huh.

873
00:51:02.659 --> 00:51:05.829
So when y'all left. I got
stuck behind this painting.

874
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:08.131
- Aw. man. we're sorry. We
just didn't know where you were.

875
00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:10.267
- Oh. nah. nah. nah. nah.
nah. nah. nah.

876
00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:11.635
It's fine. It's fine.

877
00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:16.473
It's just. I saw
Jesminder and Bartok.

878
00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:18.809
and at first they were
just talking.

879
00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:24.481
But then they got a little
smoochie. which is fine.

880
00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:25.315
That's fine.

881
00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:28.385
But then-
- Then?

882
00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:34.057
- He stabbed her and stabbed
her until she was dead!

883
00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.492
- What?

884
00:51:35.492 --> 00:51:37.160
- With the Knife of
Dagon. right in the chest.

885
00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.429
And I watched all the
life drain from her eyes

886
00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:41.098
until she passed out
and turned into

887
00:51:41.098 --> 00:51:43.100
some kind of soulless ghoul.

888
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.936
♪ Somewhere out there ♪

889
00:51:45.936 --> 00:51:47.737
- Wait. what the fuck
is happening?

890
00:51:47.737 --> 00:51:50.874
- Sorry. When I get nervous.
I start singing Fievel.

891
00:51:50.874 --> 00:51:52.142
Can I get one of those?

892
00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:52.943
- Yeah.

893
00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:56.746
(Onyx sighs)

894
00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:59.349
It doesn't sound like
immortality Mr. Duke.

895
00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:01.451
What the fuck is going on?

896
00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:03.086
Why did they really
bring us here?

897
00:52:04.521 --> 00:52:08.225
- Marcus. are you sure you
saw what you think you saw?

898
00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:09.693
- Oh. huh. Well. no.

899
00:52:09.693 --> 00:52:11.528
Let me think about it.
Maybe I. no. maybe I did.

900
00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:13.196
Yes. I fucking saw what
I think I saw.

901
00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:14.331
- Okay. okay.

902
00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:16.066
- The knife took out all
of her soul goo.

903
00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:19.569
And the handle glowed like
a bedazzled Lite-Brite.

904
00:52:19.569 --> 00:52:22.672
- Marcus. do you think you can
draw what that looked like?

905
00:52:22.672 --> 00:52:23.507
- Yes. sir.

906
00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:27.210
- Did he say anything or
speak anything

907
00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.045
while these actions occurred?

908
00:52:29.045 --> 00:52:31.314
Yeah. Some kind of incantation.

909
00:52:31.314 --> 00:52:32.549
- Do you remember any of it?

910
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:35.685
- Yeah. it was like. uh.
uh. dada.

911
00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:37.854
or doo doo. dada doo doo.
or no.

912
00:52:37.854 --> 00:52:39.122
maybe doo doo came first.

913
00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:42.259
Doo doo. dada. doo doo. uh.
Scooby-Doo.

914
00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:44.227
uh. yabba-dabba-doo.

915
00:52:48.398 --> 00:52:50.100
- My word.

916
00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.702
This is. I believe. the
Talisman of Souls.

917
00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:55.939
- Hmm. Interesting.

918
00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:57.107
- What?

919
00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:59.242
- The smoke burns as it
fills my lungs.

920
00:52:59.242 --> 00:53:00.710
I've never had a
cigarette before.

921
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:02.445
and I feel like I'm gonna
vomit my entrails out.

922
00:53:02.445 --> 00:53:03.880
(Onyx retches)
- Okay.

923
00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.017
Uh. we really have to
find that missing page.

924
00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:08.285
- The what?

925
00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:11.288
- In the Grimoire. after
the ritual of Abaddon.

926
00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:12.856
there was a warning.

927
00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:15.825
It stated. "Beware the
prophecy of the."

928
00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.594
and then the next page
was missing.

929
00:53:19.095 --> 00:53:20.564
- I think I saw
the missing page.

930
00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:21.831
- You did?
- Where?

931
00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:23.333
- It was taped behind the
painting.

932
00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:26.036
I saw it when Jesminder was
getting zoinked and mcgoink'd.

933
00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:27.470
- Goodnight. honored guests.

934
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.573
Please retire to your
individual quarters

935
00:53:29.573 --> 00:53:31.641
and meet downstairs in
the morning.

936
00:53:31.641 --> 00:53:34.578
for tomorrow we will prepare
for our second ritual.

937
00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:36.446
- Ah. that's it.

938
00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:43.019
- Which will lead us one
step closer to immortality.

939
00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:48.491
- During the second ritual.
one of us

940
00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:51.228
sneaks off to retrieve
the missing page.

941
00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:55.365
That page might help me put all
these puzzle pieces together

942
00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:57.968
and uncover what awaits us.

943
00:53:57.968 --> 00:54:01.304
Something tells me that
Bartok and delegate

944
00:54:01.304 --> 00:54:04.140
have a puzzle of their
own to solve.

945
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:08.044
Let's just hope we solve
ours first.

946
00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:14.718
(birds chirping)
(gentle music)

947
00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:18.855
- Welcome to the Ritual of
the Box Demon.

948
00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:22.559
You will each enter
this room alone. empty.

949
00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:25.462
except for a peculiar
wooden box.

950
00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:27.530
Open the doors to that box.

951
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.800
There you will confront a
small yet powerful demon.

952
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.271
To this demon you will
unburden yourself.

953
00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:37.974
Share with it a secret that
weighs heavily on your heart.

954
00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:41.011
Yes. Mackenzie?

955
00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:42.379
- Where's Jesminder?

956
00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:43.813
I mean. don't we need her
for the ritual?

957
00:54:43.813 --> 00:54:45.282
- Yeah.

958
00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:48.652
- Jesminder is helping
our master with something

959
00:54:48.652 --> 00:54:49.986
of great importance.

960
00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:53.723
A preparation for the

961
00:54:56.393 --> 00:54:57.861
final ritual.

962
00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:03.767
In exchange for that secret.
you will request a truth.

963
00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:04.834
Ask wisely.

964
00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:08.805
Ask for an answer that
no one could give you.

965
00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:13.176
No one except for our
Eternal Father.

966
00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:18.114
But beware. for the truth
this creature speaks

967
00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:20.317
is not for the faint of heart.

968
00:55:20.317 --> 00:55:22.952
For what he knows about
you could challenge

969
00:55:22.952 --> 00:55:24.621
the very essence of self

970
00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:29.893
and untether you with a singular
devastating proclamation.

971
00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:32.595
(dramatic music)

972
00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:35.298
Yes. Marcus?

973
00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:37.834
- I gotta take a big ol' shit.

974
00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:40.737
- Now?
- Um. let me check.

975
00:55:40.737 --> 00:55:44.941
(groans) Yeah. now. For sure.

976
00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:46.843
- Fine. then go. We'll start
without you.

977
00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.745
But if you're not back
before your turn.

978
00:55:48.745 --> 00:55:50.980
by Satan's unholy name. you
will be rendered ineligible

979
00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:53.516
and ejected from Bartok's
mansion post-haste.

980
00:55:53.516 --> 00:55:54.951
- Got it.

981
00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:58.121
Shit quick else be deemed
unworthy.

982
00:55:59.322 --> 00:56:01.925
- Mackenzie. would you
like to go first?

983
00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:03.727
- I'd be honored.

984
00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:10.467
(door clanging)
(Shelley giggles)

985
00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:17.340
(Shelley giggling)

986
00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:22.479
(dramatic music)

987
00:56:27.183 --> 00:56:29.953
(door squeaking)

988
00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:39.362
(bats squealing)

989
00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:41.164
- (coughs) Goddammit.

990
00:56:41.164 --> 00:56:44.167
How are all these cobwebs
at exactly mouth level?

991
00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:51.908
(dramatic music)

992
00:56:57.046 --> 00:57:00.150
- Keeping it beefy.
Keeping it beefy.

993
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:02.986
Keeping it beefy.
Keeping it beefy.

994
00:57:02.986 --> 00:57:05.388
Keeping it beefy.
Keeping it beefy.

995
00:57:05.388 --> 00:57:06.222
- [Onyx] Huh.

996
00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:09.993
(door squeaks)

997
00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:14.964
(Mack sobs)
- Yes.

998
00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:19.502
The box demon speaks directly
to your soul's cradle.

999
00:57:19.502 --> 00:57:23.673
Steady yourselves and steel
your nerves for his truths.

1000
00:57:23.673 --> 00:57:24.507
Mr. Duke.

1001
00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:31.714
(door squeaks)

1002
00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:39.923
- I'm ready to go in.

1003
00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:42.292
- [Farrah] Hmm.

1004
00:57:43.693 --> 00:57:45.695
- [Onyx] (grunts) Gotta
get back for the box demon.

1005
00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:48.398
Gotta get back for the
box demon.

1006
00:57:48.398 --> 00:57:50.066
- [Mr. Duke] Uh-huh.

1007
00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:54.170
(door slams)

1008
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.840
- Oh. how's it going down here
with all the box demon stuff?

1009
00:57:58.541 --> 00:58:01.611
- Shelley.
(Shelley squeals)

1010
00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.648
- I gave him the page.

1011
00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:07.050
- Shut the fuck up.
- Yep.

1012
00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:09.786
(dramatic music)

1013
00:58:13.022 --> 00:58:15.458
(Shelley screams)
Oh!

1014
00:58:15.458 --> 00:58:18.228
- [Shelley] You've shattered
my mind!

1015
00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:21.264
Oh. oh. there's a raccoon
in the car!

1016
00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:23.867
(door squeaks)

1017
00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:29.873
(Shelley sobbing)

1018
00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:36.946
- Whatever's going on in there
must be pretty heavy stuff.

1019
00:58:36.946 --> 00:58:38.214
(laughs) It's probably
for the better

1020
00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:39.949
that I emptied out my
system first.

1021
00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:42.585
- [Shelley] No. don't ever
let go. Don't ever let go.

1022
00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:48.124
(door squeaks and slams)

1023
00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:54.597
(chiming music)

1024
00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.370
- Go to him. Go to your master.

1025
00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.906
(Shelley sobs)

1026
00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:11.047
- Shelley. where are you going?

1027
00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:15.251
- She's going to her master.
She's in quite a state.

1028
00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:16.920
- Yeah. we all are. but
I think it'd be better

1029
00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.855
if we just stay together.
I mean. right. Shelley?

1030
00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:20.757
Stay with me.
- I...

1031
00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:23.660
- Mackenzie. please. We
all have free will here.

1032
00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.794
- I'm not gonna let him
do to her what he did

1033
00:59:24.794 --> 00:59:26.763
to Jesminder. you hear me?

1034
00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:29.966
- Jesminder?
Whatever could you mean?

1035
00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:32.368
- Yes. Mack.
whatever could you mean?

1036
00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:37.740
Shelley. he's ready for
you now.

1037
00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.842
- What the fuck?

1038
00:59:39.842 --> 00:59:42.579
- [Shelley] I want
to see Bartok.

1039
00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:45.682
- Wait here for your friend.

1040
00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:48.418
(dramatic music)

1041
00:59:53.056 --> 00:59:55.825
(cabinet squeaks)

1042
00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:58.561
(box demon coos)

1043
01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:02.231
- Come closer. my son.

1044
01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:07.770
Closer.

1045
01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:14.243
(box demon groans and sneezes)

1046
01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:17.981
(Onyx gasps)

1047
01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.482
Let it in. my son.

1048
01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.051
Let it in.

1049
01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:27.123
Now. won't you feed me a
secret. Marcus?

1050
01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.094
- I dunno.

1051
01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:32.695
- Dig deep. my son.

1052
01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:37.834
Go to the darkest. most
shameful parts of you.

1053
01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.603
What is there?

1054
01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.773
- Oh. uh. I guess.

1055
01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:48.177
huh.

1056
01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:52.382
Sex?

1057
01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:53.916
- Yes.

1058
01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:58.788
What do you see when you think
of your most carnal desires?

1059
01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.226
- Well. I guess I think
about my.

1060
01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:06.863
my fantasies.
- Ooh.

1061
01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:08.531
Tell me more.

1062
01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:12.568
Ooh. ooh. ooh. what's buried
in the core

1063
01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.671
of your chamber of shame?

1064
01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.540
- Uh. yeah. my shame-ber?

1065
01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:22.178
Uh. well. my deepest.
darkest fantasies

1066
01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:24.981
revolve around a series
of fan fiction I wrote.

1067
01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:27.483
Short novellas really.
based on Gadget Hackwrench

1068
01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:28.951
from "Chip 'n Dale's
Rescue Rangers."

1069
01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:31.988
- Oh. yes.

1070
01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.990
- In it. I play a mix
between Dale

1071
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.259
and Marky Mark's character
from "Boogie Nights."

1072
01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:39.195
I call myself Dale Diggler.
(laughs)

1073
01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:41.464
And. uh. let's just say
the things we get to fixing

1074
01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:43.099
in the Ranger Plane after
hours.

1075
01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:47.603
well. (laughs) yeah. it's more
than just rusty propellers.

1076
01:01:47.603 --> 01:01:50.073
(Onyx laughs)

1077
01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:54.744
'Cause eventually she
starts fixing my wiener.

1078
01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:57.747
- (laughs) Mm. Tasty.

1079
01:01:57.747 --> 01:02:02.652
Num. num. num. That secret
will do.

1080
01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:07.123
Now. what truth do you seek?

1081
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.095
- Anything?

1082
01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:13.863
- Anything.

1083
01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:24.474
- Oh. demon in a box.
how I beg of you.

1084
01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:28.111
Oh. demon in a box. please
answer me true.

1085
01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:31.614
Oh. demon in a box. how I
wish to see

1086
01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:38.788
why my father Carl left my
mother and me.

1087
01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:44.594
- [Box Demon] Oh. Marcus.
Don't you know?

1088
01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:48.231
It was because of you.

1089
01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:54.003
- What?

1090
01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:58.908
- [Box Demon] You simply
weren't enough.

1091
01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:02.612
You weren't enough to keep
him there.

1092
01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:07.049
Weren't enough to keep
them together.

1093
01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:12.121
Think hard. go deep.
You'll remember.

(cabinet slams)

1121
01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:42.011
- Onyx. are you okay? What
did the demon say to you?

1122
01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:43.579
- Huh? Oh. yeah. I'm good.

1123
01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:45.248
He actually said a bunch
of cool stuff to me.

1124
01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:46.749
He was like. "I bet you
got a big ol' wiener.

1125
01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:48.351
and you probably fuck a
lot too."

1126
01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:50.086
So yeah. I just wanted
to celebrate

1127
01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:52.521
all the cool stuff he said.
(laughs)

(dramatic music)

1129
01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.496
- Well. Mr. Duke wants
us to rendezvous with him

1130
01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:01.831
to discuss his findings.

1131
01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.099
He's been deciphering the
prophecy. and-

1132
01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:05.301
- Oh. cool. Yeah. prophecies
are so fun.

1133
01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:07.270
Yeah. let's do it.
Let's rendezvous.

(Onyx chugging)

1137
01:05:23.886 --> 01:05:28.090
- Onyx. maybe you wanna
slow down a little.

1138
01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.659
- Loud and clear. boss.

1139
01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:34.664
- "It is foretelling a
prophecy that will disrupt

1140
01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:38.868
the rising of Abaddon.

1141
01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:43.873
Beware the prophecy of
the unexpected."

1142
01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:45.474
no. "unforeseen."

1143
01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.613
Oh. come on. John.

1144
01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.417

1145

of the Fortuitous One."

1146
01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:03.326

- What?

1147
01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:05.394
- What?
- What?

1148
01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:08.164
(Shelley yells)
- What?

1149
01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:10.199
(Shelley whimpers)

1150
01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:11.167
- Nothing. I-

1151
01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:14.637
(Shelley thuds)

1152
01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.006
- That's right.

1153
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.176
Give me everything.

1154
01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:26.148
Every last drop.

1155
01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:29.251
(Shelley whimpering)

1156
01:06:32.054 --> 01:06:35.891
- Onyx. what did you call
yourself when we first met?

1157
01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.626
- Huh? Oh. I don't remember.

1158
01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:40.730
- It was Onyx the Fortuitous.
wasn't it?

1159
01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.898
- Nah. nah. nah. nah. nah.
Nah. nah. nah.

1160
01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:44.700
I might have said Onyx the
Fortunate One.

1161
01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.570
because I am ever so fortunate
to have won this contest

1162
01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:50.773
and be invited here to be with
all of you wonderful people.

(Onyx chugging)

1164
01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:53.642
- What else does it say?

1165
01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:56.312
I mean. what happens if
the ritual is disrupted?

1166
01:06:56.312 --> 01:06:57.246
What happens if it isn't?

1167
01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:59.849
- I. I. I. I. I don't know.

1168
01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.417
I need more time with the page.

1169
01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:03.085
There. there's so much here.

1170
01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:04.086
- Onyx. if you...

1171
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:08.324
(Mack sighs)

1172
01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:13.329

(Onyx chugging)

1173
01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:18.501
Onyx. what are you doing?

1174
01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.837
- Huh? Oh. I'm just
trying to relax. (laughs)

1175
01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:24.373
I mean. all this talk of
demons and prophecies.

1176
01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:28.210
I mean. whoo. it is too
mooch. (laughs)

1177
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:31.013
And I just wanna party.
Don't you?

1178
01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:33.582
I mean. everyone's so stuffy
here. right?

1179
01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:37.453
Bartok and Farrah and all
their fucking bullshit.

1180
01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:41.490
Huh? All their fucking
bullshitty robes.

1181
01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.025
And they're dumb-dumb hats.

1182
01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:47.763
I mean. what kind of dumb-dumb
wears a hat like this?

1183
01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:50.299
It's stupid. And this.

1184
01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:55.271
Fuck this goofy-ass emerald
bullshit.

1185
01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:58.407
- It's. it's peridot.

1186
01:07:58.407 --> 01:08:01.143
- Well. fuck this peridot
bullshit.

(Onyx chugging)

1192
01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.432
- What's happening?

1193
01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.968
- I don't think he liked
what the demon said to him.

1194
01:08:25.968 --> 01:08:27.603
- Ah. You know what's weird?

1195
01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.006
No one has danced since
we got here.

1196
01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:33.642
And that's a real shame. huh?

1197
01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:36.545
'Cause dancing really
frees you up. huh?

1198
01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:40.583
Dancing gets you loose. (laughs)
gets you outta your head.

1199
01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:44.920
Farrah. you wanna dance
with me? Come on. baby.

1200
01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.590
(laughs) Nah? All right.
that's fine.

1201
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.892
I can dance by myself. (laughs)

1202
01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:54.163
Oh. yeah. she gets it. Come on.

1203
01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:57.566
Let it take you over. Let
the rhythm take you over.

1204
01:08:57.566 --> 01:09:00.035
Rhythm take you over.

1205
01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:02.071
Oh. fuck. She's a ghoul.
(laughs)

1206
01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:04.306
- What. what did he say?

1207
01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:07.042
- He said. "Oh. fuck.
she's so cool."

1208

1209

1245
01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:40.462
- Then be with me. Free
me from Bartok's rule.

1246
01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:41.563
- Schwa?

1247
01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:45.267
- He raised me from the
depths. gave me life.

1248
01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:48.570
but a life of enslavement
is no life at all.

1249
01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.907
I can be given a new life by
the one the prophecy speaks of.

1250
01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:54.009
Together you and I can
defeat Bartok.

1251
01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:56.378
But if we don't. he will
complete the final ritual

1252
01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:59.548
and use the power of Abaddon
to take the souls of millions.

1253
01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:02.384
But if you and I-
(growling)

1254
01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:04.153
Oh. no. It's too late.

1255
01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:09.058
He found us.
- Who?

1256
01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:12.127
- Abaddon.

1257
01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:16.098
- [Abaddon] Come to me.
patty slinger.

1258
01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:20.769
Come to me. (growls)

1259
01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:25.374
(dramatic music)

1260
01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:30.245
(Abaddon growling)

1261
01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:38.854
- How can I make your day a
bit beefier?

1262
01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:42.491
- Marcus J. Trillbury.

1263
01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:46.095
we meet at last.

1264
01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:50.833
I've heard so much about you.

1265
01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:57.673
The patty slinger. The virgin.

1266
01:12:57.673 --> 01:13:01.744
The fool. Know this. Marcus.

1267
01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:04.513
You are many things.

1268
01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:08.717
but you are not the
Fortuitous One.

1269
01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:13.055
I have seen the
Fortuitous One.

1270
01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:19.061
Does that look like you.
Onyx the Fart-uitous?

1271
01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:25.634
(creature squelching)

1272
01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:26.468
Does it?

1273
01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:29.438
- No. sir. it does not.

1274
01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:33.142
- In less than one day's time.

1275
01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:38.147
I will rise through an unholy
vessel and enslave the Earth.

1276
01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.417
Face it. patty slinger.

1277
01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:45.621
your time is up. (roars)

1278
01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:49.691
(Onyx screams)
(Abaddon laughs)

1279
01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:54.696
There's nowhere to run.
(laughs)

1280
01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:57.332
Patty slinger. Patty slinger.

1281
01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:03.939
I'm coming to get you.
patty slinger. (laughs)

1282
01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:13.048
How can I make your day
a bit beefier? (laughs)

1283
01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:21.390
When in doubt. skewer it out.

1284
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:24.359
Yahhh!
- Jesus!

1285
01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:25.194
Jesus!

1286
01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:28.363
- Hey. it's okay. Onyx.

1287
01:14:28.363 --> 01:14:30.098
It's all right. Lay. lay down.

1288
01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:30.933
You're all right.

1289
01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:32.868
Here. drink this.

1290
01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:35.904
- What is it?

1291
01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:40.509
- Ginger. turmeric. mint.
elder flower.

1292
01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:43.111
some other things that'll
help your stomach.

1293
01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:49.818
- I'm sorry. Zee. I don't
know what came over me.

1294
01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:51.887
- It's all good.

1295
01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:54.590
Uh. your little episode
was the perfect distraction

1296
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.825
Mr. Duke needed to work
on his translations.

1297
01:14:58.227 --> 01:15:00.295
- Oh. sick.
(stomach gurgles)

1298
01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:01.830
Mm.
- Drink.

1299
01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:06.235
I spent some time in the walls.

1300
01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:09.071
This place is a maze.

1301
01:15:10.472 --> 01:15:13.308
Dozens of corridors all
leading somewhere different.

1302
01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.145
- Thanks for taking
care of me. Zee.

1303
01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:22.017
- That's what friends
are for. Onyx.

1304
01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:25.354
- Oh. yeah. For sure.

1305
01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:29.992
Yeah. I know what friends are

1306
01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:33.795
and what their general
responsibilities consist of.

1307
01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:36.431
(Mack cries)

1308
01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:39.034
(somber music)

1309
01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:44.306
Zee. are you okay?

1310
01:15:47.075 --> 01:15:48.410
- No. I. um.

1311
01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:55.050
I feel stupid. Onyx.

1312
01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:00.556
Stupid for trusting Bartok.

1313
01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:04.059
Trusting anyone. really.

1314
01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.896
I should have known better.

1315
01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:11.567
And I'm.

1316
01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:17.105
I'm scared.

1317
01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:20.576
I'm really scared.

1318
01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.179
(solemn music)

1319
01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:31.253
- I used to get scared
whenever I'd go on sleepovers.

1320
01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:35.691
Even to my best friend
Billy Davis's house.

1321
01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:40.195
'Cause it all felt so
weird and unfamiliar.

1322
01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:46.501
That's when his mom.
Linda. taught me that song.

1323
01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:52.307
And just like Fievel. my
fears would be soothed

1324
01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:55.310
and I'd be asleep in no time.

1325
01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:03.118
'Cause she reminded me that
no matter how alone we feel.

1326
01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:09.558
no matter how far away
from home we might be.

1327
01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:14.997
we're still underneath the
same sky as the people we love.

1328
01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.434
Just remember.
you do have friends.

1329
01:17:21.336 --> 01:17:22.838
And you're never really alone.

1330
01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.742
Because we're all under
the same moon.

1331
01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:32.648
(Mack chuckles)

1332
01:17:36.952 --> 01:17:39.821
- That's all you saw
in the dream.

1333
01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:41.790
the chubby one playing
the piano

1334
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:44.559
and smashing mirrors
with a cane?

1335
01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:48.530
- Yes. What I saw is what
I told you.

1336
01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:52.100
- Hmm.

1337
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.870
(ghoul wheezing)

1338
01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:00.442
Farrah?

1339
01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:03.612
- Yes. master?

1340
01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:09.785
- Why do you insist on
mocking my intelligence.

1341
01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:14.589
undermining my power.
deriding my virility?

1342
01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:16.925
- Master. I-
- Do you not think

1343
01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:18.093
he speaks to me?

1344
01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:24.366
Do you not think Lucifer
himself speaks directly to me?

1345
01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:26.935
To me!

1346
01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:32.240
Or a succubus shrew who
sleeps in a shed?

1347
01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:39.548
Give it to me.
(Farrah moans)

1348
01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.783
Put it in my hand.

1349
01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:43.285
Put it in my hand.

1350
01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:52.127
(Bartok grunts)
(the figurine shatters)

1351
01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:54.863
(dramatic music)

1352
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.939
What's the point of having a
psychic demon bitch's power

1353
01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:09.544
at my disposal if all she
does is fucking lie to me?

1354
01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:13.582
- I didn't lie to you. master.

1355
01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:17.786
- Oh. no. you just chose
not to tell me

1356
01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:20.288
that you sensed something
when they first arrived.

1357
01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:22.057
You just chose not to tell me

1358
01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:24.192
when they witnessed the
taking of a soul.

1359
01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:27.863
You just chose not to
tell me that they stole

1360
01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:32.868
the fucking prophecy right
from underneath our noses!

1361
01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:36.404
(ghouls wheezing)

1362
01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:40.308
Now. if you don't tell
me what you're sensing.

1363
01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:44.946
what you're seeing when
you see it. I swear to you-

1364
01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:46.915
(metal clangs)
(Farrah gasps)

1365
01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:51.920
I will take this fucking
life from you.

1366
01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:55.290
- You can't kill a demon
with the Knife of Dagon.

1367
01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:58.827
- You know what? I know that
I can't kill you with this.

1368
01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:03.498
But what I can do is
sever your fucking head

1369
01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:07.235
and put it in a display
case for all eternity.

1370
01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:09.905
shielded in unbreakable
Nazarene glass.

1371
01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:12.707
That I can do!

1372
01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.145
- He is here.

1373
01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:21.116
- Who?

1374
01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:22.751
- The Fortuitous One.

1375
01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:26.121
(dramatic music)

1376
01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:28.690
(bright music)

1377
01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:38.700
(bright music continues)

1378
01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:45.073
(Mr. Duke whispering
indistinctly)

1379
01:20:47.075 --> 01:20:47.876
- Yes.

1380
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:50.712
Yes. that's it.

1381
01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:52.781
That's it. I see it now.

1382
01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:53.782
I see it all now.

1383
01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:59.120
(laughs) Outstanding.

1384
01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.455
- It's the teacher. isn't it?

1385
01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:04.292
- Mm-mm. The patty slinger.

1386
01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:08.296
- Oh. fucking right.

1387
01:21:08.296 --> 01:21:10.131
(object clattering)

1388
01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:11.700
How dare you?

1389
01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.302
You still try to make a fool
out of me?

1390
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:17.439
- No. I swear. I saw him.

1391
01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:22.244
- You saw the man of destiny.

1392
01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:26.882
the demon killer. the
slayer of the bright realm?

1393
01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:31.586
- Here within these walls.

1394
01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:34.189
(dramatic music)

1395
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:36.758
(Bartok gasps)

1396
01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:41.496
One more lie.

1397
01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:45.700
and I swear.

1398
01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:50.972
- It was the teacher. You
were right. I was wrong.

1399
01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:53.241
I just wasn't seeing as
clearly as you.

1400
01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:56.444
(dramatic music)
(Farrah sighs)

1401
01:21:56.444 --> 01:21:57.412
- I knew it.

1402
01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:04.886
(Farrah growling)

1403
01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:16.364
I have no doubt our Father
looks down upon you in shame.

1404
01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:21.836
(ghoul grunts)

1405
01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:26.107
(dramatic music)

1406
01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:33.581
(knocking)
- Yes?

1407
01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:35.917
- [Bartok] Mr. Duke.
I wondered

1408
01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:37.652
if you had a moment to spare.

1409
01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:52.500
- Of course. I would
be honored.

1410
01:22:57.973 --> 01:22:59.040
- Wow.

1411
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:06.781
You really are a man
of studies. aren't you?

1412
01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:10.218
- Well. what can I say?
Knowledge excites me.

1413
01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:13.321
- I can see that.

1414
01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:20.996
So tell me. what knowledge

1415
01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:25.834
have you discovered tonight?

1416
01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:32.540
- That you are not the
person you've said you are.

1417
01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.976
and that your plans for
us. hmm.

1418
01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:38.513
well. they aren't what
we were led to believe.

1419
01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:44.719
- (laughs) Well. that
is a matter

1420
01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:48.156
of perspective. isn't it?

1421
01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:53.294
After all. I am offering
you immortality.

1422
01:23:55.864 --> 01:24:00.835
- (chuckles) You only gain
Abaddon's power

1423
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:04.372
by offering the demon
five souls.

1424
01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.242
We would live eternally.

1425
01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:09.711
as your prisoners.

1426
01:24:11.112 --> 01:24:13.681
locked within the talisman
until the end of time.

1427
01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:17.385
Immortality.

1428
01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:22.390
No. undying pain and suffering

1429
01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:24.592
as we remain cognizant

1430
01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:27.529
of our never-ending state
of purgatorial stasis.

1431
01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:31.833
Now. that. that is more
like it. yes?

1432
01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:36.471
- Eh. Tomato. tah-mah-toe.

1433
01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:41.443
(dramatic music)
(Mr. Duke yells)

1434
01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:46.648
(ominous music)

1435
01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:52.353
(Mr. Duke yells)
(Mack gasps)

1436
01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:54.289
(Mr. Duke hums)
(door squeaks)

1437
01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:56.758
- Mr. Duke. are. are you
okay? What did you find?

1438
01:24:56.758 --> 01:24:58.726
- Oh. don't be silly.
Of course I'm fine.

1439
01:24:58.726 --> 01:25:01.629
And I found nothing.
Nothing but the truth.

1440
01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:04.833
That we should follow
Bartok's words to the letter

1441
01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.968
and join him for the
final ritual.

1442
01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:09.104
Right fucking now.

1443
01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:14.375
- Are you seeing regular
Mr. Duke or ghoul Mr. Duke?

1444
01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.144
- What? Regular.

1445
01:25:17.312 --> 01:25:20.215
- Huh. Because he's
definitely a ghoul now.

1446
01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:22.784
(Mr. Duke growls)

1447
01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:24.452
We should run!

1448
01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:27.088
(Mr. Duke growling)

1449
01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:28.756
- [Mack] Come on.

1450
01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:31.226
(Onyx shrieks)
(Mr. Duke growling)

1451
01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:34.229
- Keep your mouth closed. These
cobwebs are something fierce.

1452
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:36.097
Oh. fuck. Are you getting
them or nah?

1453
01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:38.800
Just me? I'm fucking
choking on webs.

1454
01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:42.971
(door rattles and squeaks)

1455
01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:45.740
Why could I see the ghoul
and you couldn't. Huh?

1456
01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.642
Why could I see the
ghoul and you couldn't?

1457
01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:49.944
- Stand guard. I need to
study this.

1458
01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:52.447
(Onyx groans)

1459
01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:56.184
Okay. Mr. Duke.

1460
01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:58.253
The peridot necklaces.

1461
01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:04.492
These crystals. Farrah's been
using them to control us.

1462
01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:06.895
Influence our will.

1463
01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.801
- Well. what else does it say?

1464
01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:15.036
Did Mr. Duke have a plan?

1465
01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:17.705
Huh? What do we do?

1466
01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:20.808
- Yeah. he had a plan.
- What's the plan?

1467
01:26:20.808 --> 01:26:22.644
Do we reanimate one of these
dead bobcats

1468
01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:24.512
and ride it straight
outta town?

1469
01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:26.481
Or do we race this old
dentist's chair downhill

1470
01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:28.316
until it picks up enough
speed to shoot us

1471
01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:31.953
into space like "Radio Flyer"?
(whimpers)

1472
01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:36.457
Or do we light this place on
fire and perish in the flames?

1473
01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:38.393
Or build a makeshift
cannon out of paperclips

1474
01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:41.729
and old white out that
we find in Bartok's desk?

1475
01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:44.499
- No.
(dramatic music)

1476
01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:50.705
I stay here and you go.

1477
01:26:52.407 --> 01:26:55.376
- What? Go where?

1478
01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:56.678
Stay here? Why?

1479
01:26:58.112 --> 01:27:00.215
- Follow the map to get out
and head to the old cemetery.

1480
01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:01.382
Find the fallen angel.

1481
01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:02.684
Once the blood moon has risen.

1482
01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:04.752
that's where the final
ritual will take place.

1483
01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:07.522
- What? They're gonna kill
you. Zee.

1484
01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:08.790
Suck out your soul like
some kind

1485
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:11.092
of demonic Dyson set on
overdrive.

1486
01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:14.462
- Listen. everything you
need is in here.

1487
01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:17.465
- What's gonna happen?

1488
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:25.139
(lips smack)

1489
01:27:25.139 --> 01:27:28.009
- You have everything you need.

1490
01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:30.211
- No! Zee. don't do this!

1491
01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:31.879
Don't do this! Don't leave me!

1492
01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:34.115
Don't leave me! I can't do
this alone!

1493
01:27:34.115 --> 01:27:37.485
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm not the Fortuitous One.

1494
01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:39.554
I'm just a fat fucking
patty slinging chubby

1495
01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:42.857
fat fucking virgin.
(door slams)

1496
01:27:42.857 --> 01:27:43.691
Zee!

1497
01:27:45.326 --> 01:27:46.160
Zee!

1498
01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:51.032
(liquid dripping)

1499
01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.743
(ominous music)

1500
01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.448
(microphone squeals)
- Paging. Mr. Bartok.

1501
01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:09.817
Paging Mr. Bartok. I'm in
your office

1502
01:28:09.817 --> 01:28:11.219
fucking up your shit.

1503
01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:12.587
What you gonna do about it?

1504
01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:18.526
(glass shattering)
(objects clattering)

1505
01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:22.297
(dramatic music)

1506
01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:25.633
(thunder crashes)

1507
01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:28.303
(ominous music)

1508
01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.639
Bartok. where are you?

1509
01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:35.343
Come and get me!
(glass shatters)

1510
01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:40.348
(Onyx panting)
(crickets chirping)

1511
01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:42.984
(eerie music)

1512
01:28:46.054 --> 01:28:49.791
(objects clattering)

1513
01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:52.627
(glass crunching)

1514
01:28:57.031 --> 01:28:59.767
(dramatic music)

1515
01:29:03.705 --> 01:29:06.474
(ethereal music)

1516
01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:16.050
(ethereal music continues)

1517
01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:24.292
- [Mr. Duke Voiceover] Dear
Onyx. if you are reading this.

1518
01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:26.627
I know things must seem
pretty grim.

1519
01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:30.598
It looks as though you
are all alone

1520
01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:34.769
facing something insurmountable.

1521
01:29:34.769 --> 01:29:38.539
But I assure you. that
isn't the case.

1522
01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:43.544
We. your friends. are with you.

1523
01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:47.081
The prophecy of the
Fortuitous One is clear.

1524
01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:50.284
If the souls are collected
underneath the blood moon.

1525
01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:53.721
a portal will open
leading directly

1526
01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:55.857
to Abaddon's lair in hell.

1527
01:29:57.258 --> 01:30:00.428
If the Fortuitous One throws
themselves into the pit.

1528
01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:03.798
they will not only be
reborn from beyond.

1529
01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:06.934
they will also have the
power to reanimate

1530
01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:10.304
the ones who have perished
by the Knife of Dagon.

1531
01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:15.543
All of this must be done under
the gaze of the blood moon.

1532
01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:18.946
lasting only 300 seconds.

1533
01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:23.951
That's five minutes.
- Got it.

1534
01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:25.052
(dramatic music)
(Mack grunts)

1535
01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:26.621
- Ade due Damballa.

1536
01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:31.225
Give me the power.
I beg of you.

1537
01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:32.660
Ade due Damballa.

1538
01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:36.831
Give me the power.
I beg of you!

1539
01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:39.801
Ade due Damballa.

1540
01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:46.607
Give me the power-
♪ Somewhere ♪

1541
01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:49.510
♪ Out there ♪

1542
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:54.315
(knife slams)
(Mack screams)

1543
01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:56.984
- [Mr. Duke Voiceover] Onyx.
I cannot say whether or not

1544
01:30:56.984 --> 01:30:59.554
you are the one the
prophecy speaks of.

1545
01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:03.024
That could not be
determined by my studies.

1546
01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:06.394
You must search within yourself

1547
01:31:06.394 --> 01:31:08.996
and find what you know
in your heart to be true.

1548
01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:13.468
However. if you are not the
Fortuitous One

1549
01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:15.870
and you throw yourself
into the hell mouth.

1550
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:19.407
you will burn alive as you
fall for miles and miles.

1551
01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:21.809
hurdling toward Abaddon's
pit deep beneath

1552
01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:23.945
the Earth's surface.
fully awake and aware

1553
01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:26.214
for the entirety of the fall.

1554
01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:29.917
Then once arriving in his lair.
undoubtedly face centuries

1555
01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:32.086
of torture at the hands
of Abaddon

1556
01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:34.689
and his many demonic minions.

1557
01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:35.690
Good luck.

1558
01:31:37.725 --> 01:31:38.559
- Huh.

1559
01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:43.431
(dramatic music)

1560
01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:50.238
I have everything I need. huh?
(dramatic music)

1561
01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:58.112
(ghouls snarling)
(dramatic music)

1562
01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:02.350
- Patty slinger!

1563
01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:06.354
The time has come.

1564
01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:10.258
The blood moon blesses us

1565
01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:14.161
and Abaddon is waiting.

1566
01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:19.000
(ghoul wheezing)
- Zee.

1567
01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:23.271
(dramatic music)

1568
01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:29.877
- No. Kneel and accept
your fate.

1569
01:32:34.749 --> 01:32:36.851
Put your magic to some
good use

1570
01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:39.186
and make this fool do
as I say.

1571
01:32:42.323 --> 01:32:44.392
- Kneel in the name of Bartok.

1572
01:32:45.793 --> 01:32:48.829
(Onyx grunts)

1573
01:32:48.829 --> 01:32:51.198
- Now we can begin.

1574
01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:55.002
Father. hear me.

1575
01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:57.872
I have done as you have asked.

1576
01:32:58.906 --> 01:33:02.176
The talisman of souls is
nearly full.

1577
01:33:02.176 --> 01:33:06.414
You have commanded.
and I have obeyed.

1578
01:33:07.848 --> 01:33:12.553
With this final offering.
we make way for Abaddon.

1579
01:33:18.025 --> 01:33:21.562
It's sad. For you. I mean.

1580
01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:26.434
But they're not really
in there anymore.

1581
01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:28.436
They're in here.

1582
01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:31.172
(dramatic music)

1583
01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:38.145
Do you know how I know

1584
01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:41.816
you aren't the Fortuitous One.
Marcus?

1585
01:33:42.683 --> 01:33:46.754
Because you don't impress me.

1586
01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:52.793
(knife slams)
(Onyx groaning)

1587
01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:56.397
Farrah. the book.

1588
01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:59.133
(dramatic music)

1589
01:34:01.836 --> 01:34:03.037
Ade due Damballa.

1590
01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:08.275
Give me the power. I beg of you.

1591
01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:12.613
Secoise entienne mais
pois de morte.

1592
01:34:12.613 --> 01:34:14.015
Ade due Damballa.

1593
01:34:16.183 --> 01:34:19.420
Give me the power.
I beg of you.

1594
01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.423
Secoise entienne
mais pois de morte.

1595
01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:26.193
Ade due Damballa.

1596
01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:31.232
Give me the power.
I beg of you!

1597
01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:36.037
Secoise entienne mais
pois de morte!

1598
01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:41.909
Rise. Abaddon! Come to me!

1599
01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:44.879
Give me power!

1600
01:34:47.148 --> 01:34:49.884
(dramatic music)

1601
01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:55.189
- Hey. Bartok!

1602
01:34:56.457 --> 01:34:58.125
I just wanted to tell
you something real quick

1603
01:34:58.125 --> 01:35:00.027
before all my soul goo is gone.

1604
01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:03.230
Hey. I just wanted to say
(indistinct whispering).

1605
01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:08.903
- What?

1606
01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:10.604
I was just trying to tell
you (whispers indistinctly).

1607
01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:18.179
- What are you saying.
patty slinger?

1608
01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:22.149
- Uh. this isn't one of Farrah's
crystals at all. (chuckles)

1609
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:24.218
It's an ultra green
pumaman variant.

1610
01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:26.120
Surprised you didn't know that.

1611
01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.856
So I'm free to do
whatever the fuck I want.

1612
01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.024
(head thuds)

1613
01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:33.360
(Bartok and Onyx groan)

1614
01:35:34.695 --> 01:35:37.998
Oh. Oh!

1615
01:35:37.998 --> 01:35:41.068
How deep does that hole go?

1616
01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:45.005
Well. here goes nothing.

1617
01:35:46.273 --> 01:35:48.709
(Onyx yells)

1618
01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:55.716
- My life's work!

1619
01:35:55.716 --> 01:35:58.252
Gone. in a flash.

1620
01:35:58.252 --> 01:36:01.722
because you wouldn't
do as you were told.

1621
01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:03.791
You couldn't keep them in line.

1622
01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:05.025
You couldn't protect years

1623
01:36:06.994 --> 01:36:11.999
of my work for one fucking
weekend! (sobs)

1624
01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:17.104
I've spent my life
preparing for this one night.

1625
01:36:21.308 --> 01:36:23.811
(Bartok sobs)

1626
01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:27.615
- [Ghouls] Let him rise.

1627
01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:30.384
Let him rise.

1628
01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.221
Let him rise.

1629
01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:38.259
- What?
- Let him rise.

1630
01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:41.529
- What?
- Let him rise.

1631
01:36:43.364 --> 01:36:47.868
- What are they saying?
Why are they saying that?

1632
01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:50.805
(flames crackling)

1633
01:36:57.311 --> 01:37:00.214
(triumphant music)

1634
01:37:09.723 --> 01:37:13.494
(triumphant music continues)

1635
01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:20.901
- I stand before you now
not as the man you once

1636
01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:22.970
knew me to be. but as a
man revivified.

1637
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:24.972
no longer made of earthly
flesh and bone.

1638
01:37:24.972 --> 01:37:26.740
but rather built of
supernatural sinew

1639
01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.210
and metaphysical muscle. not
unlike the genetic builds

1640
01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:30.978
of angels and demons
that wage forever war

1641
01:37:30.978 --> 01:37:33.314
in opposing kingdoms.
battling over the fates

1642
01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:35.649
of monsters and mites
until both time and space

1643
01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:40.087
stretch to bleak nothingness
and the stars refuse to expand.

1644
01:37:40.087 --> 01:37:42.189
But for what is this
battle raging. you ask.

1645
01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:44.158
I dunno. What stands at
the center?

1646
01:37:44.158 --> 01:37:46.126
To that I say my soul is at
the center.

1647
01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:49.263
for I am Onyx the Fortuitous.
slayer of the bright realm.

1648
01:37:49.263 --> 01:37:51.799
an altered warrior destined
to return my friends' souls

1649
01:37:51.799 --> 01:37:55.636
to their bodies and seal this
weeping hell portal thusly.

1650
01:37:55.636 --> 01:37:59.139
(majestic music)

1651
01:37:59.139 --> 01:38:03.444
I dunno. Being reborn is
pretty cool.

1652
01:38:03.444 --> 01:38:06.780
(dramatic music)

1653
01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.450
(Bartok groans)

1654
01:38:11.285 --> 01:38:13.287
Not much time left!

1655
01:38:13.287 --> 01:38:16.490
Quick. ghoul buddies.
single file.

1656
01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:19.426
(triumphant music)

1657
01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:24.331
- Farrah. please!
(shovel thuds)

1658
01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:26.267
- Our Father was wrong to
choose you.

1659
01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:29.236
His faith in foolish men
never ceases to amaze me.

1660
01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:33.707
- Is this how you repay me
after all I've done for you?

1661
01:38:33.707 --> 01:38:35.409
(ghouls gurgling)

1662
01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:36.877
- This is gonna feel weird
at first.

1663
01:38:36.877 --> 01:38:39.346
but then it'll feel good 'cause
you'll get your souls back.

1664
01:38:39.346 --> 01:38:42.349
(laughs) When in doubt.
skewer it out.

1665
01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:47.321
(dramatic music)
(ghouls yelling)

1666
01:38:48.188 --> 01:38:49.523
- What are you going to do?

1667
01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:53.027
Kill me?
- No. Worse.

1668
01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:55.562
Klaatu barada nikto.

1669
01:38:55.562 --> 01:38:58.399
(ghouls groaning)

1670
01:39:00.034 --> 01:39:04.972
(blood squelching)
(Bartok gurgles)

1671
01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.776
(ghouls moaning)

1672
01:39:09.843 --> 01:39:12.780
(ghoul yells)

1673
01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:14.048
I guess that's what you get
for trusting

1674
01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:16.150
a psychic demon bitch.

1675
01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:18.852
(dramatic music)

1676
01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:24.858
- [Onyx] Hmm.

1677
01:39:26.293 --> 01:39:28.796
- Now's the time. Onyx. what
I spoke about in your dreams.

1678
01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:30.197
- What?
- Your destiny.

1679
01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:32.633
the way forward for you. for us.

1680
01:39:33.834 --> 01:39:37.638
- Woah! You mean like a sexy
way forward?

1681
01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:39.606
- If the Fortuitous One
joins with a demon.

1682
01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:41.575
they can take Abaddon's
power and rule together

1683
01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:43.110
as kings and queens in hell.

1684
01:39:45.012 --> 01:39:48.015
- Uh. when you say join with
a demon. you mean to like

1685
01:39:48.015 --> 01:39:49.016
get married?
- Fuck.

1686
01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:50.584
- Oh. fuck. Okay. right.
got it.

1687
01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:53.620
So reign with you in hell
and leave my friends behind.

1688
01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:57.491
or stay here with them and
be without my demon bride.

1689
01:39:57.491 --> 01:39:59.393
- I knew it was you all along.

1690
01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:01.095
I know you could feel me too.

1691
01:40:01.095 --> 01:40:02.930
guiding you. pulling
you through.

1692
01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:04.264
Stay with me. Onyx.

1693
01:40:04.264 --> 01:40:05.632
Together. hell can be what
we make of it.

1694
01:40:05.632 --> 01:40:08.535
Slave to no master. a
kingdom of our very own.

1695
01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:10.237
- But-

1696
01:40:11.238 --> 01:40:14.541
(ghouls moaning)

1697
01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:16.043
My friends.

1698
01:40:16.043 --> 01:40:17.544
- This is our last chance.
Onyx.

1699
01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:19.913
Be with me now or leave me
and forever be my enemy.

1700
01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:22.850
(suspenseful music)

1701
01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:23.951
- I'm sorry. Farrah.

1702
01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:26.954
but I can't rule with you
in hell.

1703
01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:29.223
My place is here.

1704
01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:32.526
With my-
(dramatic music)

1705
01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:35.162
- With what? A band of
losers. know nothings?

1706
01:40:35.162 --> 01:40:38.165
Is that what you want over
loyalty and exaltation?

1707
01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:39.533
Then take your rightful
place as the leader

1708
01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:42.002
of the forever forsaken
ugly fuck-ups.

1709
01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:44.104
- Farrah!

1710
01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:46.540
- Farewell.
Onyx the Fortuitous.

1711
01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:48.442
Until we meet again
in your nightmares.

1712
01:40:49.343 --> 01:40:51.612
(Farrah growls)

1713
01:40:51.612 --> 01:40:54.314
(dramatic music)

1714
01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:06.360
- Ah. you're better off
without her. Fortuitous One.

1715
01:41:07.494 --> 01:41:11.265
- Yeah. I think you're right.
Oh. shit.

1716
01:41:11.265 --> 01:41:15.769
(laughs) Y'all transformed.
That's fucking tight.

1717
01:41:15.769 --> 01:41:19.773
That is fu-. that's.
that's tight (laughs)

1718
01:41:19.773 --> 01:41:21.875
Yeah. And he's dead.

1719
01:41:24.078 --> 01:41:27.381
(liquid squelches)
- [All] Aw. Huh.

1720
01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:30.384
(knocking)
- (laughs) Hello?

1721
01:41:32.052 --> 01:41:34.354
Oh. come on. Oh. you're
so bad.

1722
01:41:35.222 --> 01:41:37.825
- Welcome to Briardale Manor.

1723
01:41:39.726 --> 01:41:41.261
- The fuck?

1724
01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:42.496
(kids laughing)

1725
01:41:42.496 --> 01:41:46.066
- (laughs) Ah. the children.
(laughs)

1726
01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:52.239
This is our room of focus
and meditation.

1727
01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:54.441
Currently our resident
witch is using it to hone

1728
01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:57.144
their newfound insights and
skills.

1729
01:41:59.012 --> 01:41:59.813
- Hey.

1730
01:42:02.249 --> 01:42:03.083
- Hi.

1731
01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:06.620
- This is the study.

1732
01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:10.290
Here. you'll find volumes upon
volumes of satanic writings.

1733
01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:11.925
If you've got a thirst for

1734
01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:15.195
it can be quenched within
these walls.

1735
01:42:17.397 --> 01:42:20.200
(Mr. Duke grunts)

1736
01:42:22.136 --> 01:42:24.738
But here is where we'll take
our lunch.

1737
01:42:24.738 --> 01:42:26.373
A place set for everyone.

1738
01:42:27.674 --> 01:42:31.545
Ah. I'm being summoned.
Excusez moi.

1739
01:42:31.545 --> 01:42:34.148
(bright music)

1740
01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:38.285

(bright music)

1742
01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:42.456
I'd be honored.

1743
01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.469
- Oh. Mr. Duke.

1744
01:42:56.236 --> 01:42:58.372
- Wonderful. (laughs)

1756
01:43:45.452 --> 01:43:48.488
- Soon. But we must
have patience.

1757
01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:50.424
We must wait until the
time is right.

1758

01:46:10.364 --> 01:46:13.333
Maybe I'm Onyx the Fortuitous.
slayer of the bright realm.

1779
01:46:13.333 --> 01:46:14.501
I dunno.

1780
01:46:14.501 --> 01:46:15.936
I do hope his eyes
gaze upon me

1781
01:46:15.936 --> 01:46:18.438
and that my allegiance is
recognized. I dunno.

1782
01:46:18.438 --> 01:46:21.375
Notice me. Senpai. notice me.

1783
01:46:21.375 --> 01:46:24.478
No. I didn't wash my shirt
in between shifts. Masha.

1784
01:46:24.478 --> 01:46:25.879
So what if I smell like
roast beef?

1785
01:46:25.879 --> 01:46:28.215
This whole place smells like
roast beef.

1786
01:46:28.215 --> 01:46:29.683
As I stared into the
darkened void.

1787
01:46:29.683 --> 01:46:31.551
imagining the hordes of
devils soon to spring forth.

1788
01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:33.053
I couldn't help but ponder.

1789
01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:35.489
how deep does that hole go?

1790
01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:39.359
I was sitting on the
orange velvet couch

1791
01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:41.595
watching "Catteries Not
Included" when suddenly

1792
01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:43.864
an arousingly confident
Gadget Hackwrench appeared

1793
01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:45.465
and asked for my help in fixing

1794
01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:47.167
the ever-beleaguered
Screaming Eagle.

1795
01:46:47.167 --> 01:46:49.236
I don't know. I acquiesced.

1796
01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:51.738
And as I handed her the hog
ring pliers. her fuzzy digits

1797
01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:56.376
grazed mine. and in that
moment. truly. I was woke.

1798
01:46:57.811 --> 01:46:59.880
But with one last look of a
warrior's accord. we vaulted.

1799
01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.415
vaulted higher than
Meat Loaf's motorcycle

1800
01:47:01.415 --> 01:47:03.884
bursting through the devilish
graveyard's stony sod.

1801
01:47:03.884 --> 01:47:05.719
and just like the Loaf.
we soared.

1802
01:47:05.719 --> 01:47:08.355
And just like the Loaf.
we sang.
