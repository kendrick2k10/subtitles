3
00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:34.125
-Ugh! This pick sucks.

4
00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:46.250
-My strap's not right. That's…

5
00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:48.250
Okay. Okay. there we go.

6
00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:53.541
-Cocks.

7
00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:55.916
All right. hold on.
Let's scoop that midrange.

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.583
-Nice.

9
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:06.541
One. two. three. four!

10
00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:13.208
Stop. stop. stop. stop. stop. stop. stop.

11
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:15.208
What was that?

12
00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:19.458
I was just-- You said play something fast.

13
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.041
Did you read the music
that I wrote for you?

14
00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:24.000
Yeah.

15
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.083
Do you know what polyrhythms are?

16
00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:29.375
Yeah.

17
00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:30.833
<i> I don't.</i>

18
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.000
<i>These aren't my drums.</i>
<i>They belong to Hunter.</i>

19
00:01:35.583 --> 00:01:39.541
<i>And he came up with the band name.</i>
<i>I don't play the drums. I play the drum.</i>

20
00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:43.041
<i>This drum. in marching band for two years.</i>

21
00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:47.125
<i>I do it to get out of PE.</i>
<i>but Hunter says that doesn't matter.</i>

22
00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:50.041
<i>All it takes to be great</i>
<i>is commitment and sacrifice.</i>

23
00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:51.666
<i>which is what metal's all about.</i>

24
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.250
<i>Or maybe it's about power.</i>

25
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:57.708
<i>or sticking it to the man.</i>
<i>or denim. or motorcycles. or speed.</i>

26
00:01:57.791 --> 00:01:59.166
<i>or the devil.</i>

27
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.083
<i>I don't totally understand it.</i>
<i>but Hunter says I don't have to.</i>

28
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.291
<i>All I have to do is--</i>

29
00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:05.083
-Play something heavy. man.
-Okay.

30
00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.083
Like. uh… "Rock of Ages"?

31
00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:09.916
Heavy.

32
00:02:12.208 --> 00:02:16.125
Play… something heavy.

33
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:21.541
Play… something heavy.

34
00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:39.708
We need a bass player.

35
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:41.958
-Mm.
-A bass player will be huge for us.

36
00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:43.875
-Yeah. no doubt.
-No doubt.

37
00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:46.041
No doubt.

38
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.458
-Stop. Stop.

39
00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:30.958
That's enough for today.

40
00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:33.416
Emily. can I talk to you for a second?

41
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.875
The song you're playing
is not the song they are playing.

42
00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.208
I'm not sure you're even playing a march.

43
00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:45.375
We've talked about this.
You have to listen and play.

44
00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:48.041
It's an orchestra. right?
I know we're in a marching band. but--

45
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.250
I see you're upset.

46
00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:51.583
Fuck you!

47
00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:53.250
Fuck you!

48
00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.875
Fuck! I don't give a fuck
about what I'm playing!

49
00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.125
I don't give a fuck
about what they're playing!

50
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.208
Fuck you!

51
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:02.208
Fuck your shitty band!

52
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:03.625
-Fucking bullshit!

53
00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:07.083
-Too bad she can't play like she throws.
-I don't give a fuck. so fuck you!

54
00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:08.166
Fuck you!

55
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.000
-Cunt!

56
00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:12.708
You can't say that in America.

57
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:15.250
<i> That seems pretty metal to me.</i>
<i>but I'm not sure.</i>

58
00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.083
<i>-I'll ask Hunter about it.</i>

59
00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:20.416
<i>He's been into many things</i>
<i>since I met him.</i>

60
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.583
<i>but he's stuck with metal</i>
<i>longer than any of them.</i>

61
00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:26.666
<i>When his mom left in seventh grade.</i>
<i>he decided it was the key to everything.</i>

62
00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:31.375
<i>If we devote ourselves to metal.</i>
<i>we'll own this school.</i>

63
00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:32.583
Watch it.

64
00:04:34.083 --> 00:04:37.375
<i>Everybody will see what we</i>
<i>really are and worship us like gods.</i>

65
00:04:40.458 --> 00:04:42.041
<i>I'm willing to give it a try.</i>

66
00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:43.708
<i>Hunter's been my best friend</i>

67
00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:47.333
<i>ever since he stopped Molly Levine</i>
<i>from pulling out my hair in third grade.</i>

68
00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:48.791
<i>He always looks out for me.</i>

69
00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:59.541
Skip Hoffman sucks pig dicks.

70
00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:03.833
I don't think he was trying to hit me.
I was just in the way.

71
00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:06.500
-Clay Moss.
-You ready for the game?

72
00:05:06.583 --> 00:05:09.458
What I'm ready for
is your homecoming after-party. man.

73
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:11.333
Yep. my parents are in Geneva.

74
00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:14.041
So bring the whole school
if you want. man. seriously.

75
00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:16.500
-Tell whoever. Everybody's invited.
-All right.

76
00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.166
-Peace out. bro.
-Catch you.

77
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:41.375
Hey. man.

78
00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:44.041
What's up?

79
00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:50.208
Asked your mom about the double bass kit?

80
00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:52.458
What'd she say?

81
00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.458
She said she doesn't have
a thousand dollars.

82
00:05:58.083 --> 00:06:00.000
Okay. well. what about
a double bass pedal?

83
00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:02.083
Won't get the resonance.
but we'll have that attack.

84
00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:04.916
Yeah. she said
she doesn't have $150 either.

85
00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.916
She's in my speech class.
I think she's English.

86
00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:19.458
Scottish. I don't know.

87
00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.375
I heard she went apeshit
on the band teacher.

88
00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:23.333
Yeah.

89
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.625
That's one messed up chick.

90
00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:44.291
<i> I've never been to a party.</i>

91
00:06:44.375 --> 00:06:46.625
<i>I always wondered</i>
<i>what people like this did at them.</i>

92
00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:49.416
<i>People whose bands</i>
<i>didn't have names like Skullfucker.</i>

93
00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:51.375
<i>Now I know.</i>

94
00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:53.458
<i>Here we are…</i>

95
00:06:54.458 --> 00:06:55.875
<i>in the middle of it all.</i>

96
00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:03.333
This rules.

97
00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:04.916
Awesome idea.

98
00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:08.000
He said everybody's invited.

99
00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:12.250
How do they do it?

100
00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:13.958
What are you talking about?

101
00:07:14.666 --> 00:07:17.791
This is like three chords and they still
can't get it right. They suck.

102
00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:18.791
Look at the drummer.

103
00:07:18.875 --> 00:07:20.750
-He's high out of his mind.

104
00:07:20.833 --> 00:07:25.750
I mean. them. all of them.
How did they just… do this.

105
00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.625
like it's the easiest thing ever?

106
00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:32.458
Okay. listen to me.
Things are gonna happen for us.

107
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:34.708
Someday. all these people
are gonna be like.

108
00:07:34.791 --> 00:07:38.958
"Holy shit!
Kevin Schlieb and Hunter Sylvester?"

109
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.875
"I went to high school with those guys."

110
00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.458
"I could've even hung out
with them. maybe."

111
00:07:44.208 --> 00:07:45.583
But it's gonna be too late.

112
00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:48.750
'cause we're gonna be too busy hanging out
with the guys from Iron Maiden.

113
00:08:04.166 --> 00:08:05.041
Great.

114
00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:11.208
Hunter. it's not that bad. actually.
once you get used to it. Seriously.

115
00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:15.041
Hunter. seriously.
our band is gonna be so awesome.

116
00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:18.541
I'm gonna practice like five hours a day.
I'm gonna be better than Ringo Starr.

117
00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:20.375
-Mmm.
-Hey!

118
00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:26.583
Whoo! Heavy metal rules!

119
00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:27.791
I have to go pee.

120
00:08:28.916 --> 00:08:32.416
-I'll drive you home when you're finished.
-After. After pee-pee.

121
00:09:04.916 --> 00:09:07.083
What are you staring at?

122
00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:11.500
You.

123
00:09:13.083 --> 00:09:14.083
Why?

124
00:09:14.166 --> 00:09:16.750
Because you're pretty.
Why else do people stare at you?

125
00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.666
People don't stare at me.

126
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.333
-That's dumb.
-What?

127
00:09:21.416 --> 00:09:22.583
Why don't they?

128
00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:24.958
I could give you a million reasons.

129
00:09:25.041 --> 00:09:26.625
My face is too narrow…

130
00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:30.375
<i>I am talking to a girl.</i>
<i>I'm not even afraid of her.</i>

131
00:09:30.458 --> 00:09:31.500
<i>Beer is amazing.</i>

132
00:09:31.583 --> 00:09:32.708
…and I'm very pale.

133
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:35.458
<i>This party was a great idea.</i>
<i>I don't care what Hunter says.</i>

134
00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:37.625
-And my nose…
<i>-Even he must be having fun right now.</i>

135
00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:39.583
What's happening. man?

136
00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:42.291
Hey. he just called you a dipshit.

137
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:45.041
-No. No. I--
-What did you call me?

138
00:09:45.125 --> 00:09:46.958
I didn't say anything to anybody. I swear.

139
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:48.291
Yes. you did.

140
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.583
Really?

141
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.958
Really.

142
00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:56.208
That's why they don't stare at me.

143
00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.166
They all stare at her.

144
00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:02.208
Her? I could've stared at her.

145
00:10:02.291 --> 00:10:06.416
I-- I don't-- I don't know either of you.
I'm an impartmentege.

146
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.458
I'm an impart-- impartial judge.

147
00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:12.500
You're funny.

148
00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:17.208
-Ow!

149
00:10:17.291 --> 00:10:18.333
Ah!

150
00:10:23.583 --> 00:10:24.583
Ah!

151
00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:30.291
Dude. what the fuck?

152
00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:33.541
Are you good. bruh? You hurt?

153
00:10:33.625 --> 00:10:36.250
-Here. let me help you.
-No. no. Let me help you.

154
00:10:36.333 --> 00:10:37.500
Take lessons.

155
00:10:37.583 --> 00:10:40.166
-You guys suck… bruh.
-Ooh.

156
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.500
I'm sorry that you feel that way.
Do you play?

157
00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:45.041
Yeah. I have a band.

158
00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:47.583
Me and my friend over here. A real band.

159
00:10:47.666 --> 00:10:49.291
A serious band.

160
00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:50.708
Not like you fucktards.

161
00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:58.958
Got it. Um. I guess we'll be seeing you
at the Battle of the Bands then.

162
00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:03.625
There hasn't been a Battle of the Bands
since Dave Migdall hung brain on stage.

163
00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:05.083
There is this year.

164
00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:08.666
Go sign up with Dean Swanson.
but maybe don't say "fucktard."

165
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.083
'cause she's
a Special Olympics ambassador.

166
00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:18.291
All right. guys.
Let's keep this party going!

167
00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:19.708
Give me your car keys.

168
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.333
-Come on.

169
00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:29.166
Mm.

170
00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:01.208
Hey.

171
00:12:01.291 --> 00:12:02.750
I was next.

172
00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:07.833
Hunter. I am busy.

173
00:12:07.916 --> 00:12:10.375
If you'd like to wait
until I am done with the Merinos--

174
00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:12.541
I demand you let us compete
in the Battle of the Bands.

175
00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:14.208
Okay.

176
00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:16.666
Not letting us play just because
we're a post-death metal band

177
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.291
would be a complete violation
of our First Amendment rights.

178
00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:22.333
Your First Amendment rights
as a minor are unclear.

179
00:12:22.416 --> 00:12:24.916
but I agree it would be wrong
to exclude you.

180
00:12:26.583 --> 00:12:29.041
So why didn't
anybody tell us about it?

181
00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:32.250
-I wasn't aware you had a death metal--
-Post-death.

182
00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:34.500
Thank you. Frank.

183
00:12:35.083 --> 00:12:36.625
A post-death metal band.

184
00:12:37.375 --> 00:12:38.958
You're welcome to participate.

185
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:42.000
as long as your performance
is appropriate.

186
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.291
I had to work on her. but we're in.

187
00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:53.791
Awesome.

188
00:12:55.791 --> 00:12:58.583
So I guess we should start
looking for a bass player. huh?

189
00:12:58.666 --> 00:13:00.125
Yeah. Yeah. definitely.

190
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:02.791
This is huge for us.

191
00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:05.791
Battle of the Bands is where
it starts for people. Check it out.

192
00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:09.041
-Troy Nix.

193
00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:10.791
Jesus.

194
00:13:10.875 --> 00:13:15.375
Guitarist and singer of Kiloton.
Battle of the Bands winners 1996.

195
00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:19.916
They were gods.

196
00:13:20.791 --> 00:13:22.791
No one in this school
liked heavy music same as now.

197
00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:25.750
but Kiloton terrorized their way
straight to victory.

198
00:13:25.833 --> 00:13:26.958
By 1997.

199
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:29.833
they were considered the greatest
unsigned metal band in the country.

200
00:13:29.916 --> 00:13:33.083
They could have been right up there
with Metallica or Pantera.

201
00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:34.541
but they broke up.

202
00:13:35.333 --> 00:13:36.958
I think drinking was involved.

203
00:13:39.208 --> 00:13:41.916
But you and me.
that's not gonna happen to us.

204
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.958
This is our moment.
Heavy music is gonna rise up.

205
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:47.833
We win the Battle of the Bands.
parlay that win into gigs.

206
00:13:47.916 --> 00:13:49.750
and then those gigs score us a deal.

207
00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:51.916
Okay. Uh…

208
00:13:52.458 --> 00:13:54.875
-What kind of deal?

209
00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.916
Cocks. Okay.
I've gotta get all the way to C Hall.

210
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.500
But. um. meet me after school.
We've got work to do.

211
00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:05.333
Hail Satan.

212
00:14:05.916 --> 00:14:06.916
'Sup. Robbie?

213
00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:10.875
-Hop in.
-Where are we going?

214
00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:17.916
<i> It doesn't seem metal</i>
<i>to ask if he's got his dad's permission.</i>

215
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.375
<i>-so I won't.</i>

216
00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:23.541
<i>But this…</i>

217
00:14:25.708 --> 00:14:29.000
<i>This definitely seems metal. right?</i>
<i>I mean. I think it does.</i>

218
00:14:30.166 --> 00:14:31.833
<i>I'm not sure my mom and dad will.</i>

219
00:14:31.916 --> 00:14:34.291
These drums
are gonna be huge for us.

220
00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:35.625
<i> He's right.</i>

221
00:14:37.125 --> 00:14:38.541
<i>-They're huge.</i>

222
00:15:00.916 --> 00:15:02.125
Shut the fuck up!

223
00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:06.333
Can I borrow the car?

224
00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:08.916
If you drop your brother off first.

225
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.208
Your father will pick him up
between shifts.

226
00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.875
I'm the best at crawl.
and I can tread water the second longest.

227
00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:20.875
That's good. Earl.

228
00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.041
And I can do the best cannonball.
everybody says.

229
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.041
What's all this stuff?

230
00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:30.500
My drums.

231
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.625
Drums are dumb.

232
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:35.625
Yeah.

233
00:16:43.375 --> 00:16:45.166
I thought you were a clarinet player.

234
00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:47.416
No. No.

235
00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:50.875
That was just so
I could do marching band instead of PE.

236
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I do that too.

237
00:16:55.333 --> 00:16:56.166
I'm Kevin.

238
00:16:57.083 --> 00:16:57.916
Emily.

239
00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:00.791
Um…

240
00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.166
I saw you on the field.

241
00:17:08.291 --> 00:17:09.875
Yeah. that was my fault.

242
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.291
I hadn't taken my meds for. like…

243
00:17:12.375 --> 00:17:14.166
…a week.

244
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.291
I-- I take Pepcid. so…

245
00:17:19.458 --> 00:17:20.291
Mm.

246
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:29.250
Do you like… heavy metal at all?

247
00:17:29.833 --> 00:17:31.666
Like <i>Rock of Ages?</i>

248
00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:34.791
Uh. no.

249
00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:36.916
More like…

250
00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:40.875
post-death doom metal?

251
00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:43.458
I don't know what that is.

252
00:18:31.666 --> 00:18:36.500
And the Slippers of Spider Climbing
go to Malmsteen of Gorgoroth.

253
00:18:38.291 --> 00:18:43.250
What kind of girlie name
is Malmsteen of Gorgoroth?

254
00:18:43.333 --> 00:18:46.000
I don't know. Dad. Why don't you ask
one of your real housewives

255
00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.125
while you're shoving water balloons
into their tits?

256
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.458
Plastic surgeon.

257
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:56.666
<i> I understand </i>Dungeons & Dragons
<i>even less than metal.</i>

258
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.208
<i>but it's a chance for us</i>
<i>to hang out with new people.</i>

259
00:18:59.291 --> 00:19:01.541
<i>especially ones who play the bass.</i>

260
00:19:01.625 --> 00:19:02.458
Malmsteen…

261
00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:05.250
<i> If he joins Skullfucker.</i>
<i>then we're a band. right?</i>

262
00:19:05.333 --> 00:19:07.541
<i>-So we can play Battle of the Bands.</i>

263
00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:10.500
<i>If people like us.</i>
<i>maybe they'll ask us to play some parties.</i>

264
00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:11.750
<i>I hope Hunter likes this guy.</i>

265
00:19:12.333 --> 00:19:15.000
<i>Sometimes he's not so nice to people</i>
<i>when he's uncomfortable.</i>

266
00:19:15.083 --> 00:19:16.333
<i>Being around his dad makes him--</i>

267
00:19:16.416 --> 00:19:19.541
Well. Malmsteen just can't believe

268
00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:23.083
that a halfling rogue
would be dumb and ungrateful enough

269
00:19:23.166 --> 00:19:25.625
to try and rip off a half-orc barbarian

270
00:19:25.708 --> 00:19:28.916
who just saved him from five ice toads.

271
00:19:30.875 --> 00:19:32.625
But he thinks he'll show mercy.

272
00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:36.666
Until he remembers
that mercy is for the weak.

273
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.250
Malmsteen pulls out Hell Slinger.
his +3 great sword…

274
00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:40.166
Hunter.

275
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.208
…and he tells Auriac Stormhollow
to shut his glory hole

276
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:45.250
before he starts his first attack.

277
00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:49.625
-Plus ten. that's a hit.
-Hunter. don't be an idiot.

278
00:19:49.708 --> 00:19:52.666
He runs the blade
between the thief's ribs.

279
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.333
-Second attack.

280
00:19:54.416 --> 00:19:55.375
Uh-oh!

281
00:19:55.458 --> 00:19:56.500
There goes the leg.

282
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.625
And for the final attack…

283
00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:01.250
Oh. shit.

284
00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:04.333
Head over to Dr. Sylvester's
for some post-op implants.

285
00:20:04.416 --> 00:20:07.041
because I just chopped off your dick.

286
00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:12.625
Sure. Sure.

287
00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:16.958
You just remember that those implants
are what paid for your guitar.

288
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:18.583
your incel action figures.

289
00:20:18.666 --> 00:20:22.541
and all your dumbass
Satan-worship T-shirts!

290
00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:26.500
I'm gonna go play tennis!

291
00:20:28.416 --> 00:20:29.916
Did you see my American Express?

292
00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:37.583
Where are you going?

293
00:20:37.666 --> 00:20:38.791
Leaving.

294
00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:42.916
This sucks compared to<i> Call of Duty.</i>
Kevin. see you in class.

295
00:20:43.583 --> 00:20:46.958
Hunter. we were going to ask him
to play bass for us.

296
00:20:48.625 --> 00:20:50.291
He says he's pretty good.

297
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:53.125
It's for the best.
We can never trust a guy like that.

298
00:20:57.708 --> 00:20:59.333
I'm telling you.
she's really good.

299
00:20:59.416 --> 00:21:02.083
We need a bass player.
A metal bass player.

300
00:21:02.166 --> 00:21:03.166
She can be metal.

301
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.583
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

302
00:21:05.666 --> 00:21:08.500
Why? Why is that the most ridiculous thing
you've ever heard?

303
00:21:08.583 --> 00:21:10.333
Because a cello-playing girl
is so non-metal

304
00:21:10.416 --> 00:21:13.000
that even thinking about it
is evaporating my balls.

305
00:21:13.708 --> 00:21:16.708
A lot of the time. Hunter.
I don't know what you're talking about.

306
00:21:16.791 --> 00:21:18.708
Metal. not metal… Uh…

307
00:21:19.375 --> 00:21:21.458
Maybe I'm just not right for Skullfucker.

308
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.500
Okay. switch places with me.

309
00:21:40.458 --> 00:21:42.041
-What?
-Just do it.

310
00:21:43.083 --> 00:21:45.333
Slide over.
Open the door. but don't get out.

311
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.208
-Did you get her number?
-Of course I got it.

312
00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:51.458
Then. what is it?

313
00:21:51.541 --> 00:21:54.000
I know I said I'd get her number.
but I got her Snapchat.

314
00:21:54.083 --> 00:21:56.666
-Snapchat is actually…
-No! No. no. no. no.

315
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.666
-No. no. no. no.
-It's fine.

316
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.500
-It's the same thing.
-It's not the same thing. You know it.

317
00:22:02.125 --> 00:22:02.958
What?

318
00:22:03.708 --> 00:22:05.041
Suck it. cunt.

319
00:22:05.125 --> 00:22:06.666
Ow!

320
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.750
Go. go! Fuck!

321
00:22:08.833 --> 00:22:10.333
Go! Fuck! Fuck!

322
00:22:10.916 --> 00:22:12.208
Go. go. go. go. go!

323
00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:16.083
Why? Why did you do that?

324
00:22:16.166 --> 00:22:17.833
Truth to power. bitch! Drive!

325
00:22:18.625 --> 00:22:19.458
Why?

326
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:31.750
Drive. If he gets close enough.
you're just as fucked as I am.

327
00:22:31.833 --> 00:22:34.958
You slow down. you die. That's metal.

328
00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:37.333
That is a dumb Keanu Reeves movie!

329
00:22:41.208 --> 00:22:42.416
Oh. shit.

330
00:22:45.208 --> 00:22:47.250
Watch out. He'll see you in the mirrors
if he gets close enough.

331
00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:50.291
What am I doing? Oh. God!

332
00:22:52.708 --> 00:22:54.541
You're an asshole.

333
00:23:03.291 --> 00:23:04.833
Okay. We can shake him.

334
00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:06.583
-Turn left on Aspen.

335
00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:14.125
Oh.

336
00:23:17.666 --> 00:23:20.166
-Don't slow down. Keep going straight.
-To where? Where?

337
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.916
-There!
-I… We will not fit in there!

338
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.125
I know this car!

339
00:23:24.916 --> 00:23:26.458
-Fucking do it!

340
00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:28.166
-Whoo!

341
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.958
-No. no. no!
-Whoo!

342
00:23:34.458 --> 00:23:35.708
Oh. fuck!

343
00:23:35.791 --> 00:23:38.208
-Oh. shit.

344
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:39.458
Whoa!

345
00:23:39.541 --> 00:23:41.916
Fuck you! Fuck you!

346
00:23:50.958 --> 00:23:51.791
Dude.

347
00:24:00.166 --> 00:24:01.625
<i> I understand now.</i>

348
00:24:01.708 --> 00:24:03.041
<i>Metal is commitment.</i>

349
00:24:03.125 --> 00:24:06.500
<i>and speaking truth to power.</i>
<i>and sticking it to the man. and speed.</i>

350
00:24:06.583 --> 00:24:08.083
That was fucking awesome.

351
00:24:09.208 --> 00:24:11.083
<i> Metal is taking the wheel.</i>

352
00:24:12.833 --> 00:24:13.666
What's this?

353
00:24:14.875 --> 00:24:17.250
-Homework.

354
00:24:17.875 --> 00:24:18.708
Black Sabbath.

355
00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.208
Iron Maiden.

356
00:24:22.708 --> 00:24:23.958
Judas Priest.

357
00:24:25.333 --> 00:24:26.333
Metallica.

358
00:24:26.916 --> 00:24:28.125
Anthrax.

359
00:24:28.208 --> 00:24:29.125
Slayer.

360
00:24:29.625 --> 00:24:30.583
Megadeth.

361
00:24:30.666 --> 00:24:31.500
Motörhead.

362
00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:32.875
Guns N' Roses.

363
00:24:32.958 --> 00:24:34.583
Rage Against the Machine.

364
00:24:34.666 --> 00:24:36.041
Pantera.

365
00:24:36.125 --> 00:24:38.625
Emperor. Tool. Dio.

366
00:24:38.708 --> 00:24:40.875
Meshuggah. Opeth. Slipknot.

367
00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:42.625
Mastodon. Lamb of God.

368
00:24:42.708 --> 00:24:44.208
This is your history now.

369
00:24:44.708 --> 00:24:46.500
Learn it. Live it.

370
00:24:47.416 --> 00:24:49.000
Do lines of it in the bathroom.

371
00:24:52.875 --> 00:24:54.125
I'll be working on this.

372
00:24:54.208 --> 00:24:56.000
It's the solo to "Machinery."

373
00:24:56.083 --> 00:24:57.250
It fucking shreds.

374
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:01.250
-I had these made up.

375
00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:03.666
For luck.

376
00:25:06.833 --> 00:25:08.416
I'll get to work on this. then.

377
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:20.958
Cocks.

378
00:25:23.791 --> 00:25:25.333
Fuck me. okay.

379
00:26:41.708 --> 00:26:42.541
Ah!

380
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:45.666
Fuck.

381
00:29:20.083 --> 00:29:21.041
Hey. Um…

382
00:29:21.625 --> 00:29:23.666
Hi.

383
00:30:28.208 --> 00:30:29.750
<i>Man. she's amazing.</i>

384
00:30:30.833 --> 00:30:33.916
<i>Maybe Hunter'll change his mind about her</i>
<i>when I tell him how much she shreds.</i>

385
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.500
…enunciation and projection.

386
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.041
These are two of the most important tools
in your communications toolbox.

387
00:30:42.833 --> 00:30:47.500
Enunciation is the way we shape
the sounds that come out of our mouths.

388
00:30:49.291 --> 00:30:50.333
Uh…

389
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.875
Dean Swanson
wants to see Hunter Sylvester.

390
00:31:30.083 --> 00:31:32.375
They only got
suspended two weeks.

391
00:31:32.458 --> 00:31:35.250
Swanson wanted a month.
but their ass-rapist coach intervened.

392
00:31:35.333 --> 00:31:37.000
Yeah. still. they're gone.

393
00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:38.833
They can't come back
to campus or anything.

394
00:31:38.916 --> 00:31:40.916
But when they come back.
they'll totally ass-rape me

395
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.750
for getting them suspended
in the first place.

396
00:31:42.833 --> 00:31:44.708
Getting them suspended? It's their fault.

397
00:31:44.791 --> 00:31:45.833
They defaced your hair.

398
00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:47.416
I flicked him in the chops first.

399
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.458
Okay. well. at Clay Moss's party.

400
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:51.666
they pushed you into the speaker
in front of everybody.

401
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.625
They started it.

402
00:31:52.708 --> 00:31:56.375
Yeah. I don't think
your average suburban Nazi shitbag

403
00:31:56.458 --> 00:31:57.458
is gonna see it that way.

404
00:32:03.833 --> 00:32:04.666
How is it?

405
00:32:07.291 --> 00:32:09.125
It's cool. Yeah. it's cool. Yeah.

406
00:32:09.208 --> 00:32:10.041
Yeah.

407
00:32:10.541 --> 00:32:14.000
Yeah. I kind of look like Jason Newsted
from Metallica. the bass player.

408
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.333
Hmm.

409
00:32:16.125 --> 00:32:17.791
Oh. right. the one who got fired.

410
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:22.458
It's more Viking than Newsted.

411
00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:24.416
Yeah. like the school mascot.

412
00:32:25.416 --> 00:32:27.375
No. No. not like the school mascot.

413
00:32:27.458 --> 00:32:29.416
Less like the school mascot
than anything on Earth.

414
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.333
More like a baby's dick
than the school mascot.

415
00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:34.375
If a baby's dick grew its own baby dick.
then my hair would be more like--

416
00:33:53.083 --> 00:33:55.583
Sorry I'm so late.
Glad you guys are still here.

417
00:33:56.208 --> 00:33:57.583
No… No problem.

418
00:33:57.666 --> 00:33:59.166
No. yeah. not at all.

419
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:01.541
Uh… Yeah. Um. so…

420
00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:03.083
Um…

421
00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:04.791
What do you know?

422
00:34:04.875 --> 00:34:08.083
Well. how about you guys start playing
and I'll work my way in.

423
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.333
Cool.

424
00:34:11.791 --> 00:34:12.625
Um…

425
00:34:13.791 --> 00:34:15.500
How far have you gone in the… the thing--

426
00:34:15.583 --> 00:34:18.541
Yeah. I… I got through Metallica.
Judas Priest.

427
00:34:18.625 --> 00:34:21.666
I'm in the middle of Slayer right now
and I'm having a little bit of trouble--

428
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.916
Okay. Okay. Let's try. uh…

429
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.958
Let's try "For Whom the Bell Tolls."
Okay? You got it. Kev?

430
00:34:27.833 --> 00:34:29.000
Yeah. okay.

431
00:34:30.416 --> 00:34:33.041
One. two. three. four. One. two.

432
00:35:03.041 --> 00:35:05.000
Yeah. Okay. cool. All right. man.

433
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.833
Let's…

434
00:35:09.583 --> 00:35:12.125
That was cool.
Le-- Um. let's try playing the song.

435
00:35:12.208 --> 00:35:13.291
Let's try playing the song.

436
00:35:13.375 --> 00:35:15.291
and we can see
how we vibe together as a band.

437
00:35:15.375 --> 00:35:20.000
and then we'll work on
all the stage-show elements later.

438
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.083
Right. Cool.

439
00:35:24.041 --> 00:35:27.208
-Two. three. four.

440
00:35:49.625 --> 00:35:50.500
I just--

441
00:35:50.583 --> 00:35:54.583
Um. I'm. like. kind of getting confused.
'cause I just don't know what else to do.

442
00:35:54.666 --> 00:35:57.541
Dude. you can play.
or you can be wasted.

443
00:35:57.625 --> 00:35:59.541
but you can't play wasted.
It's not working out.

444
00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:02.000
We don't need a bass player
to beat those stooges.

445
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.708
Just keep it us two.

446
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:07.541
Okay. Like. uh… White Stripes.

447
00:36:07.625 --> 00:36:10.416
Weak. No. here. check this out.

448
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:12.541
It's just two guys.

449
00:36:15.958 --> 00:36:19.375
It means that we wouldn't have to split
our contest winnings three ways…

450
00:36:20.625 --> 00:36:22.166
Something to consider.

451
00:36:56.833 --> 00:36:57.916
That's mean.

452
00:36:59.125 --> 00:37:00.000
Yeah. it is.

453
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.083
<i>It doesn't feel</i>
<i>like a good time</i> <i>to tell Hunter</i>

454
00:37:05.166 --> 00:37:08.083
<i>that I don't wanna be in a band</i>
<i>that sounds like people being tortured.</i>

455
00:37:08.166 --> 00:37:12.166
<i>But I think it's time for him to seriously</i>
<i>consider the only good option we have.</i>

456
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:13.666
<i>No. it's a great option.</i>

457
00:37:14.333 --> 00:37:16.625
<i>It is time to speak truth to power.</i>

458
00:37:16.708 --> 00:37:20.583
We have. like. two weeks.
and she can learn everything in two days.

459
00:37:20.666 --> 00:37:22.375
It's nothing personal. Emily.

460
00:37:22.458 --> 00:37:25.916
It's just you're not consistent
with the image we're trying to project…

461
00:37:27.541 --> 00:37:28.916
like I told Kevin.

462
00:37:30.666 --> 00:37:31.791
Is it because she's a girl?

463
00:37:32.666 --> 00:37:33.625
No.

464
00:37:33.708 --> 00:37:37.000
Well… what about Joan Jett?

465
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.083
Doesn't she rock?

466
00:37:39.708 --> 00:37:41.750
Um. the-- What about The Runaways?

467
00:37:41.833 --> 00:37:42.875
That's Joan Jett.

468
00:37:42.958 --> 00:37:46.291
-Okay. Well. there's Lita Ford.
-That's The Runaways.

469
00:37:46.375 --> 00:37:47.458
And there's. um…

470
00:37:47.541 --> 00:37:49.541
There's. uh… What's her-- Um…

471
00:37:50.125 --> 00:37:51.791
-Kevin.
-Uh. what-- what's…

472
00:37:51.875 --> 00:37:53.541
-What's the one with the song…
-Kevin.

473
00:37:53.625 --> 00:37:55.625
Kevin. Kevin. Kevin. Kevin.

474
00:37:55.708 --> 00:37:56.916
Kevin. we are a metal band.

475
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.666
We are not an indie metal band.
We are not an alt-metal band.

476
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.083
We are not a sort of metal band.
We are a metal band.

477
00:38:02.166 --> 00:38:05.541
And for us to have a cello player
instead of a bass player

478
00:38:05.625 --> 00:38:06.916
would be completely gay.

479
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.083
-Uh…

480
00:38:24.708 --> 00:38:26.625
You've gotta take all that in context.

481
00:38:27.208 --> 00:38:28.416
Gay?

482
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.333
Gay? Our band is called Skullfucker.

483
00:38:31.416 --> 00:38:32.791
Skullfucker.

484
00:38:32.875 --> 00:38:34.958
You named it that to impress girls?

485
00:38:35.041 --> 00:38:37.416
We're gonna die virgins
in a band called Skullfucker.

486
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.458
What I meant was. we're not--

487
00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:45.500
Oh. come on. Like she didn't know.

488
00:38:59.583 --> 00:39:00.416
Hello?

489
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.000
<i>-Hey. It's Kevin.</i>
-Oh.

490
00:39:03.583 --> 00:39:04.458
<i> Hey.</i>

491
00:39:06.375 --> 00:39:09.916
Uh. hey. I… wanted to apologize

492
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.083
<i>again for Hunter being so rude. and…</i>

493
00:39:13.875 --> 00:39:16.250
<i>-That stuff he said. He--</i>
It's okay.

494
00:39:17.208 --> 00:39:18.541
I'm one too.

495
00:39:19.291 --> 00:39:20.291
Hm?

496
00:39:20.875 --> 00:39:22.416
A virgin.

497
00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.625
I know. it's a shocker.

498
00:39:25.208 --> 00:39:26.458
Oh. um… Uh. no.

499
00:39:26.541 --> 00:39:31.458
I was talking about that stuff
he said about girl cello players

500
00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:33.125
<i>in a metal band being gay.</i>

501
00:39:33.208 --> 00:39:34.708
Right. Sorry. Eh…

502
00:39:34.791 --> 00:39:36.833
<i>First of all.</i>
<i>that's a totally messed up thing to say.</i>

503
00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:38.041
Well. maybe he's right.

504
00:39:38.125 --> 00:39:41.375
No. he's not. and…you're not.

505
00:39:41.458 --> 00:39:42.375
<i>Not what?</i>

506
00:39:42.458 --> 00:39:45.958
Are we talking gayness.
or heavy metal. or virginity?

507
00:39:46.875 --> 00:39:47.875
Uh. um…

508
00:39:49.041 --> 00:39:50.416
All of them. I think. Uh…

509
00:39:51.083 --> 00:39:53.041
They seem related.

510
00:39:54.416 --> 00:39:56.416
You are. right?

511
00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.000
Gay? I don't think so.

512
00:39:58.083 --> 00:39:59.833
<i>I guess there's sort of a spectrum.</i>

513
00:39:59.916 --> 00:40:00.750
A virgin.

514
00:40:03.625 --> 00:40:04.625
Oh. um…

515
00:40:06.541 --> 00:40:08.083
Yes. definitely.

516
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:10.583
Hm…

517
00:40:10.666 --> 00:40:14.458
Do… you want to?

518
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.583
To…

519
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.500
Do you want to not be?

520
00:40:24.916 --> 00:40:26.125
I. uh…

521
00:40:27.125 --> 00:40:29.083
Y-- yes.

522
00:40:29.166 --> 00:40:31.291
Uh. um… Uh. do you?

523
00:40:31.958 --> 00:40:34.958
-You know where Temple Solel is?
-On Cleavy? Yeah.

524
00:40:35.041 --> 00:40:37.625
<i>Will you meet me</i>
<i>in the car park in a half hour?</i>

525
00:40:37.708 --> 00:40:39.708
Oh. and can you bring thingies?

526
00:40:41.791 --> 00:40:42.875
For your thingy?

527
00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:48.333
Hey. Mom. Uh…

528
00:40:49.291 --> 00:40:50.875
-I need the car.
-Okay.

529
00:40:50.958 --> 00:40:54.833
Well. your father should be back
from the shop around 8:00.

530
00:40:54.916 --> 00:40:56.875
-And then we--
-Mom. I need the car.

531
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:03.750
Fucking…

532
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.666
-I know. I know.

533
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.625
-We said 6:15.

534
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.791
It is now 8:00.

535
00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:27.000
-Well. something came up.
-What?

536
00:42:27.583 --> 00:42:28.750
What came up?

537
00:42:33.541 --> 00:42:34.375
Nothing.

538
00:42:34.458 --> 00:42:36.541
I thought it was something.
You said it was something.

539
00:42:36.625 --> 00:42:39.125
Well. I was wrong. It was nothing.

540
00:42:39.791 --> 00:42:43.625
I can imagine something
being more important than a band practice.

541
00:42:44.375 --> 00:42:45.791
Actually. I can't.

542
00:42:45.875 --> 00:42:49.291
But I definitely can't see how nothing
could be more important. Kevin.

543
00:42:49.375 --> 00:42:51.583
Well. nothing
is more important.

544
00:42:51.666 --> 00:42:54.291
Or nothing isn't more important.

545
00:42:54.375 --> 00:42:55.208
What I mean--

546
00:42:55.291 --> 00:42:57.375
I don't need Abbott and Costello
from you. okay?

547
00:42:57.458 --> 00:42:59.541
I need a drummer. A real drummer.

548
00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:02.708
Metal is commitment. Kevin.

549
00:43:02.791 --> 00:43:04.708
It's dedication. sacrifice.

550
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:07.208
mortification of the flesh
and all that shit.

551
00:43:07.291 --> 00:43:08.291
It's serious.

552
00:43:08.375 --> 00:43:09.666
And if you're not gonna be.

553
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.583
if you'll be all "girls with cello.
showing up whenever I feel like it."

554
00:43:12.666 --> 00:43:13.916
then this isn't gonna work.

555
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.750
And we won't win the Battle of the Bands.

556
00:43:15.833 --> 00:43:18.750
and then you're gonna be a loser
for the rest of your life.

557
00:43:53.333 --> 00:43:54.166
Hey.

558
00:43:56.958 --> 00:43:57.791
Hey!

559
00:43:58.375 --> 00:43:59.958
-Hey!
-Oh. hey.

560
00:44:02.791 --> 00:44:03.750
Hi.

561
00:44:03.833 --> 00:44:05.458
Where did you learn how to play?

562
00:44:05.541 --> 00:44:06.541
Uh…

563
00:44:06.625 --> 00:44:07.458
I don't know.

564
00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:10.791
My friend just gave me these songs.
and I practiced them.

565
00:44:11.666 --> 00:44:14.041
I'm not. you know.
a real drummer or anything.

566
00:44:14.125 --> 00:44:15.583
Are you fucking high?

567
00:44:16.083 --> 00:44:17.458
That was intense.

568
00:44:19.125 --> 00:44:20.041
Yeah?

569
00:44:20.666 --> 00:44:22.000
Have you got a minute?

570
00:44:34.041 --> 00:44:37.916
Are they all like this? Just pretty much
the same beat all the way through?

571
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.083
-Yeah.
-Pretty much.

572
00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:43.708
Please. Kevin. I promised my sister.
and she's so psyched to have us play.

573
00:44:43.791 --> 00:44:46.500
But Ray's not getting out of rehab
for another month.

574
00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:49.291
and we're tired of playing
with a wasted drummer.

575
00:44:49.375 --> 00:44:51.166
-Yeah. man.
- Fuck that dummy.

576
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.708
I would like to.

577
00:44:52.791 --> 00:44:55.750
but it's like I said.
I'm in this band with Hunter.

578
00:44:55.833 --> 00:44:58.958
and Battle of the Bands
is really important to him.

579
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:02.250
-Lots of guys are in two bands.
-Eric Clapton was in. like. 60 bands.

580
00:45:02.333 --> 00:45:03.916
And I heard you play. man.

581
00:45:04.458 --> 00:45:06.666
You could learn our songs in ten minutes.

582
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.625
Don't even worry
about the Battle of the Bands for now.

583
00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:12.083
just my sister's wedding.

584
00:45:14.416 --> 00:45:16.583
-Let me think about it.
-I feel you.

585
00:45:17.083 --> 00:45:18.791
But the wedding's this weekend.

586
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.250
<i>so don't think too long.</i>

587
00:45:30.291 --> 00:45:31.791
-Fuck.

588
00:45:31.875 --> 00:45:32.708
You blinked.

589
00:45:33.208 --> 00:45:34.791
-I blunk.
-You blunk.

590
00:45:36.791 --> 00:45:37.875
Three out of five?

591
00:45:39.208 --> 00:45:41.625
I'm pretty sure
you're better at staring than me.

592
00:45:41.708 --> 00:45:42.583
Mm-hmm.

593
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.250
Those your meds?

594
00:45:48.958 --> 00:45:49.833
Mm-hmm.

595
00:45:50.583 --> 00:45:52.166
My happy pills.

596
00:45:55.083 --> 00:45:57.333
-Don't you need more?

597
00:45:57.416 --> 00:45:58.250
Mm-mm.

598
00:46:06.333 --> 00:46:07.666
Lay on top of me.

599
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:23.833
Not yet.

600
00:46:26.291 --> 00:46:27.291
Let's just. um.

601
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:29.500
lie like this.

602
00:46:30.666 --> 00:46:31.500
I like it.

603
00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:35.875
Makes me feel… smooshed.

604
00:46:41.166 --> 00:46:43.791
On the field. when I first saw you…

605
00:46:44.291 --> 00:46:45.125
Yeah.

606
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.416
…did it feel… good to

607
00:46:50.208 --> 00:46:52.166
throw stuff and yell at people?

608
00:46:56.875 --> 00:46:57.708
No.

609
00:46:59.916 --> 00:47:04.541
Feels good to not want to throw stuff
and yell at people.

610
00:47:08.416 --> 00:47:09.666
You're my happy pill.

611
00:47:17.333 --> 00:47:18.333
Mm.

612
00:47:26.583 --> 00:47:27.833
It's only a wedding.

613
00:47:28.875 --> 00:47:31.958
Look. you've got to understand something.
Kevin. We don't fit in.

614
00:47:32.041 --> 00:47:35.208
You can try as hard as you want.
You can get yourself a girlfriend.

615
00:47:35.291 --> 00:47:36.875
or whatever. but you still won't fit in.

616
00:47:36.958 --> 00:47:40.291
She doesn't fit in either.
Why can't we all not fit in together?

617
00:47:40.375 --> 00:47:42.833
We're not talking about that now.
I don't even wanna go there.

618
00:47:42.916 --> 00:47:44.500
We're talking about you being a traitor--

619
00:47:44.583 --> 00:47:45.708
Maybe I wanna talk about it.

620
00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:48.750
I'm the founding member of Skullfucker.
and I say no Yokos.

621
00:47:48.833 --> 00:47:49.958
You said "fuck."

622
00:47:50.041 --> 00:47:51.875
We are both founding members
of Skullfucker.

623
00:47:51.958 --> 00:47:53.500
-Don't!
-I am way more founding.

624
00:47:53.583 --> 00:47:55.916
I write songs. buy equipment.
designed our Facebook page--

625
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.041
Oh. fuck our Facebook page!

626
00:47:57.125 --> 00:47:59.375
I'm the founding member of Skullfucker.
and I say no Yokos!

627
00:47:59.458 --> 00:48:01.000
-No more fuck!
-Shut up!

628
00:48:01.083 --> 00:48:02.291
End of conversation.

629
00:48:02.375 --> 00:48:05.208
No. you-- No. You can't just declare
end of conversation.

630
00:48:05.291 --> 00:48:06.458
You don't have that authority.

631
00:48:10.541 --> 00:48:11.875
Fine. end of conversation.

632
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.333
And that is how you knit a sweater.

633
00:48:21.708 --> 00:48:23.583
Very good. Andrea.

634
00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:27.750
Did you hear
how she enunciated and projected?

635
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:30.041
Get her all the way in the back. right?

636
00:48:30.625 --> 00:48:32.375
And now. Hunter.

637
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:38.750
<i>"Death closes all</i>

638
00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:41.916
<i>But something ere the end</i>

639
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.666
<i>Some work of noble note</i>

640
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:45.916
<i>May yet be done</i>

641
00:48:47.416 --> 00:48:50.791
<i>Not unbecoming men that strove with gods."</i>

642
00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:55.875
Tennyson's "Ulysses."

643
00:48:55.958 --> 00:48:57.875
You might know it from your English class.

644
00:49:00.125 --> 00:49:01.791
This speech is about metal.

645
00:49:10.333 --> 00:49:12.708
Metal is about what "Ulysses" was about.

646
00:49:12.791 --> 00:49:14.750
Striving with gods.

647
00:49:14.833 --> 00:49:17.750
Striking out for unknown territory.

648
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:21.000
The people that crossed the Bering Strait
12.000 years ago?

649
00:49:25.791 --> 00:49:26.625
Metal.

650
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:29.250
That Kon-Tiki guy?

651
00:49:34.041 --> 00:49:34.875
Metal.

652
00:49:35.625 --> 00:49:38.166
The people on the Mayflower…

653
00:49:38.666 --> 00:49:41.041
…would've been metal
if it weren't for all the Jesus crap.

654
00:49:41.625 --> 00:49:43.333
And Ulysses. what did he do?

655
00:49:43.416 --> 00:49:44.250
Huh?

656
00:49:45.958 --> 00:49:48.125
Read Dante. He'll tell you.

657
00:49:49.208 --> 00:49:52.708
Ulysses got together
the baddest ass crew he could find.

658
00:49:52.791 --> 00:49:55.958
and then he sailed off
beyond the Pillars of Hercules.

659
00:49:56.041 --> 00:49:58.250
and then he was drowned.

660
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:02.500
and pulled right down to hell.

661
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.541
Eighth circle.

662
00:50:11.625 --> 00:50:14.208
What is more metal than that?

663
00:50:14.958 --> 00:50:16.291
Only the ninth circle.

664
00:50:18.208 --> 00:50:22.875
So… achieving your dreams
with fellow badasses.

665
00:50:22.958 --> 00:50:25.375
going to hell if you have to…

666
00:50:26.375 --> 00:50:28.125
Oh. that sounds great. right?

667
00:50:29.208 --> 00:50:31.458
But it wasn't so easy for Ulysses.

668
00:50:33.041 --> 00:50:34.166
See. he had. um…

669
00:50:35.791 --> 00:50:36.750
He had Penelope.

670
00:50:38.208 --> 00:50:41.166
Mrs. Ulysses. keeping him down.

671
00:50:43.375 --> 00:50:45.041
"Stay home."

672
00:50:45.666 --> 00:50:46.708
"Be king."

673
00:50:47.916 --> 00:50:50.541
"Go to work every day."

674
00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:56.000
He wasted decades of his life
on that shit.

675
00:50:56.083 --> 00:50:57.416
-Hunter.

676
00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.250
-Stop it.

677
00:50:59.333 --> 00:51:02.833
But one day. Ulysses decided
he was finished with his woman.

678
00:51:02.916 --> 00:51:04.416
Hunter. that's enough!

679
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.875
It was inevitable.

680
00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:09.291
Sooner or later. the metal inside him
was bound to rise up…

681
00:51:09.375 --> 00:51:12.333
…and crush
whatever stood in its path!

682
00:51:12.416 --> 00:51:14.625
-Fucker! Fucking cunt!
-You're fucking crazy!

683
00:51:14.708 --> 00:51:16.916
I'll fucking-- I will fucking kill you!

684
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.041
-Don't you ever come near me again!
-Ow!

685
00:51:20.291 --> 00:51:22.208
-Not the guitar!

686
00:51:24.208 --> 00:51:27.375
That was inappropriate.
bordering on inexcusable.

687
00:51:27.458 --> 00:51:28.666
I completely agree.

688
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:30.000
I'm talking about you.

689
00:51:31.083 --> 00:51:31.916
Wait. what?

690
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.458
Is that what you've learned
from your interactions

691
00:51:34.541 --> 00:51:36.958
with the vicious morons like Skip Hoffman?

692
00:51:37.833 --> 00:51:39.583
How to torment people weaker than you?

693
00:51:39.666 --> 00:51:41.791
Look. I've got
some personal issues with her--

694
00:51:41.875 --> 00:51:45.625
I could give a shit about
your personal issues with that poor girl.

695
00:51:47.125 --> 00:51:49.666
You're going to write down
exactly what you did.

696
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.375
If Miss Johnson corroborates your account.

697
00:51:52.458 --> 00:51:55.625
I'll include it in the disciplinary notice
I'll send to your father.

698
00:51:55.708 --> 00:51:59.000
If she doesn't. I will suspend you.

699
00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:27.833
Your friend's a massive dick.

700
00:52:33.958 --> 00:52:35.208
What the fuck?

701
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:38.916
The fuck you doing?

702
00:52:39.416 --> 00:52:44.583
You are afraid of everybody.
and instead of showing it like I do.

703
00:52:44.666 --> 00:52:48.041
you treat everybody like shit
and you make them hate you.

704
00:52:48.125 --> 00:52:50.708
Great. They leave you alone.
they leave me alone.

705
00:52:50.791 --> 00:52:53.458
Both of us are alone.
Mission accomplished.

706
00:52:53.541 --> 00:52:54.875
-No. no. no--
-No. shut up.

707
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.833
You need me a lot more than I need you.

708
00:52:59.375 --> 00:53:02.250
Without me.
all of your dumb fantasies disappear.

709
00:53:02.833 --> 00:53:05.333
But without you.
I might actually live a real life.

710
00:53:08.041 --> 00:53:10.333
You… You can't.

711
00:53:10.416 --> 00:53:11.291
You can't.

712
00:53:14.875 --> 00:53:16.083
We're Skullfucker.

713
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:28.041
Fine. Fine. Go enjoy
your new fucking wacko girlfriend

714
00:53:28.125 --> 00:53:30.375
and your new---
and your new shitty band and--

715
00:53:30.958 --> 00:53:32.583
And<i> Rock of Ages!</i>

716
00:53:33.541 --> 00:53:34.500
It's my fault.

717
00:53:35.083 --> 00:53:37.208
It's Hunter's fault. He's a massive dick.

718
00:53:37.291 --> 00:53:38.875
But I never would've lost it like that

719
00:53:38.958 --> 00:53:42.000
-if I hadn't stopped taking my meds.
-It was not your fault! Wh--

720
00:53:47.833 --> 00:53:48.916
No. don't…

721
00:53:51.958 --> 00:53:53.625
-I'm not mad.

722
00:53:55.666 --> 00:53:58.583
You didn't do anything wrong.
There's nothing wrong with you.

723
00:53:58.666 --> 00:53:59.708
Yeah. there is.

724
00:54:00.291 --> 00:54:03.708
The concentration of serotonin
in my synapses is too low.

725
00:54:05.416 --> 00:54:09.375
Okay. but there's something more wrong
with everyone else.

726
00:54:10.958 --> 00:54:14.083
You have a right to be mad.
especially at Hunter.

727
00:54:14.166 --> 00:54:16.625
Why am I like this?

728
00:54:18.833 --> 00:54:21.583
Everybody else
didn't make me like this.

729
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:25.208
Hunter didn't make me like this.

730
00:54:25.708 --> 00:54:27.916
-My parents love me.

731
00:54:28.875 --> 00:54:30.833
They try as hard as they can.

732
00:54:33.041 --> 00:54:34.708
Nah. not their fault.

733
00:54:35.541 --> 00:54:37.041
You're not anybody's fault.

734
00:54:37.125 --> 00:54:38.208
Huh.

735
00:54:38.291 --> 00:54:39.333
You're not…

736
00:54:41.666 --> 00:54:42.500
a fault.

737
00:54:42.583 --> 00:54:43.416
You--

738
00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:52.708
There may be something…
wrong with you. but…

739
00:54:56.416 --> 00:54:57.375
you're perfect.

740
00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:21.750
You ever get angry?

741
00:55:22.916 --> 00:55:23.875
Sometimes.

742
00:55:29.416 --> 00:55:30.250
I get it.

743
00:55:30.958 --> 00:55:33.791
Sometimes… also sad.

744
00:55:39.875 --> 00:55:40.791
You know why?

745
00:55:41.958 --> 00:55:43.000
I don't know.

746
00:55:44.916 --> 00:55:47.541
It's because people treat you
like you're invisible.

747
00:55:49.416 --> 00:55:51.250
Like you're not even there.

748
00:55:51.333 --> 00:55:52.500
Like you're nothing.

749
00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.500
But you're more than that.
You're better than that.

750
00:55:56.583 --> 00:55:58.791
You're not nothing. You're something.

751
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.166
You're somebody.

752
00:56:02.166 --> 00:56:03.041
I'm Robbie.

753
00:56:04.416 --> 00:56:05.583
Fuck yeah. you are.

754
00:56:14.958 --> 00:56:16.750
We're done taking shit. you and me.

755
00:57:18.625 --> 00:57:20.958
Take off the costume. Krusty the Clown.

756
00:57:21.041 --> 00:57:24.375
We gotta talk about this. uh. "What I did
at school today" essay right here.

757
00:57:24.458 --> 00:57:27.625
Sorry. you're just a little late
with the whole parenting thing.

758
00:57:28.458 --> 00:57:29.833
Get back inside!

759
00:57:29.916 --> 00:57:31.625
Go bang another nurse!

760
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:39.833
Fuck.

761
00:59:02.416 --> 00:59:03.916
This is private property.

762
00:59:05.166 --> 00:59:06.500
My drummer's in there.

763
00:59:07.041 --> 00:59:08.208
I'm going in.

764
00:59:08.291 --> 00:59:10.333
No. you ain't. Get the hell out of here.

765
00:59:11.041 --> 00:59:12.375
Who are you

766
00:59:13.083 --> 00:59:14.875
to stop a man

767
00:59:15.541 --> 00:59:17.708
who strives with gods?

768
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:32.291
That was great. brother.
Really great.

769
00:59:32.375 --> 00:59:33.708
Yeah. it was fun.

770
00:59:33.791 --> 00:59:37.000
You killed that shit. We never sounded
anything like that before.

771
00:59:37.083 --> 00:59:38.958
I want you to know. man. if…

772
00:59:39.458 --> 00:59:41.541
If you wanna play with us
at the Battle of the Bands.

773
00:59:41.625 --> 00:59:43.041
we would love to have you.

774
00:59:43.875 --> 00:59:45.416
Or even if you don't.

775
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.708
I mean. if you just wanna hang.
it's… It's all good.

776
00:59:49.458 --> 00:59:50.291
Thanks.

777
00:59:50.958 --> 00:59:53.125
Yeah. I might take you up
on both of those.

778
00:59:54.208 --> 00:59:55.083
Respect.

779
00:59:57.625 --> 00:59:59.125
Wanna come hang with the other dudes?

780
00:59:59.208 --> 01:00:00.375
Yeah. Yes.

781
01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:02.416
Let me just finish up here.

782
01:00:14.958 --> 01:00:16.458
You're lucky they didn't press charges.

783
01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:18.125
I want my stuff back.

784
01:00:18.208 --> 01:00:21.208
Weapons confiscated from a minor
at the time of an arrest

785
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:23.250
shall be considered forfeit
to the township.

786
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.416
This is the last straw. No. wait.

787
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.708
No.

788
01:00:31.791 --> 01:00:34.166
This is the last straw.

789
01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:37.708
Mm? Right there.

790
01:00:44.333 --> 01:00:46.458
-What are you gonna do?

791
01:00:56.833 --> 01:00:57.666
Listen. look.

792
01:00:57.750 --> 01:01:00.333
-The Battle of the Bands is on Friday--
-Not for you it ain't!

793
01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:10.500
Let's go.

794
01:01:11.583 --> 01:01:13.083
-Go. go. go.

795
01:01:20.708 --> 01:01:21.541
Hey!

796
01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:24.333
Drummer boy!

797
01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:27.958
I…

798
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.166
I don't have a bathing suit.

799
01:01:50.458 --> 01:01:53.291
Every time I see you. you are wasted.

800
01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:54.208
Yeah.

801
01:01:55.208 --> 01:01:56.833
Hey. let me try your glasses.

802
01:02:03.166 --> 01:02:04.208
I like these.

803
01:02:04.708 --> 01:02:07.791
I saw Timothée Chalamet
wearing glasses like this on Insta once.

804
01:02:07.875 --> 01:02:09.791
I like <i>Call Me by Your Name.</i>

805
01:02:09.875 --> 01:02:11.500
It's so sweet. right?

806
01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:13.500
He's so hot in that.

807
01:02:13.583 --> 01:02:16.250
My cousin in Santa Barbara
totally fucked him.

808
01:02:21.375 --> 01:02:23.375
You're staring at me again.

809
01:02:23.458 --> 01:02:24.291
Uh…

810
01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:26.500
I can't even see you.

811
01:02:26.583 --> 01:02:29.250
Hmm. Yeah.
Well. I don't even know your name.

812
01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:30.833
It's Kevin.

813
01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:33.208
Kendall.

814
01:02:44.583 --> 01:02:45.541
See me now?

815
01:02:51.875 --> 01:02:54.958
Yo. dude.
What. are you waiting for a tutorial?

816
01:02:55.875 --> 01:02:59.833
Come on. man. What about Emily?
They've got a real relationship.

817
01:02:59.916 --> 01:03:02.208
One built on trust and emotional honesty.

818
01:03:02.291 --> 01:03:05.666
And this? I mean. come on. dude.
What's really going on here?

819
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:08.750
Hold on. Tom. Kendall's a person too.

820
01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:11.750
She likes Kevin.
She's making her desires known.

821
01:03:11.833 --> 01:03:13.750
There's absolutely nothing wrong
with that.

822
01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:17.000
Yeah. maybe. but Emily's really loyal.
This would ruin her.

823
01:03:17.083 --> 01:03:18.833
Back in the day. we all got up to stuff.

824
01:03:18.916 --> 01:03:21.208
He's only a drummer.
He should have what he wants.

825
01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:23.250
If he's in that hot tub.
he'll have what he gets.

826
01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:25.541
<i>A year ago.</i>
<i>I didn't know who these guys were.</i>

827
01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:27.416
<i>But now. after a bottle of champagne.</i>

828
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.166
<i>they're all making</i>
<i>some really good points.</i>

829
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.208
Oy.

830
01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:32.083
Oy!

831
01:03:32.666 --> 01:03:34.333
You found someone who loves you.

832
01:03:35.083 --> 01:03:36.125
Do you love her back?

833
01:03:36.958 --> 01:03:38.000
Uh-huh.

834
01:03:38.083 --> 01:03:40.083
Then. don't be an asshole. Kevin.

835
01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:45.708
I'm sorry.

836
01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:47.458
I have to go.

837
01:03:49.291 --> 01:03:50.541
I have a girlfriend.

838
01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:59.041
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Rob Halford of Judas Priest.</i>

839
01:04:00.541 --> 01:04:02.875
<i>You don't turn your back</i>
<i>on the people who love you.</i>

840
01:04:13.833 --> 01:04:14.958
I'm gonna get this.

841
01:04:16.708 --> 01:04:17.666
You don't have to.

842
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:18.791
I want to.

843
01:04:26.666 --> 01:04:28.666
Oh. Here it is.

844
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:35.500
I've been looking for this
for. like. forever.

845
01:04:36.875 --> 01:04:38.583
-I should have it.
-What?

846
01:04:40.041 --> 01:04:41.833
-I found it.
-What? Give me that.

847
01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:48.250
You wouldn't even know
about Lamb of God if it wasn't for me?

848
01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:54.416
Cunt.

849
01:05:43.791 --> 01:05:45.625
Listen. I've got to get out
of here immediately.

850
01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:46.750
I've got this important--

851
01:05:46.833 --> 01:05:49.708
We are doing
a preliminary eval on you. right?

852
01:05:49.791 --> 01:05:52.083
Let's get started.

853
01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:53.250
I'm Dr. Nix.

854
01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:01.208
Troy Nix?

855
01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:02.125
Yeah.

856
01:06:04.041 --> 01:06:05.333
The Troy Nix?

857
01:06:07.666 --> 01:06:08.625
From Kiloton?

858
01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:12.583
Yeah. that's right.

859
01:06:15.291 --> 01:06:17.916
Dude. Dude. you guys were gods.

860
01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.375
-I-- I go to Glenwood Lake High. man.
-I see that.

861
01:06:21.875 --> 01:06:23.333
Hmm. My condolences.

862
01:06:24.666 --> 01:06:27.000
-So you're a doctor now?
-Yeah.

863
01:06:28.666 --> 01:06:30.041
Was an alcoholic.

864
01:06:30.125 --> 01:06:33.333
Place like this saved me
from a slow fucking suicide.

865
01:06:33.416 --> 01:06:35.416
so I went back to school. got my Psy D.

866
01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:38.458
Give something back. that kind of shit.

867
01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:40.333
What happened to Kiloton?

868
01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:42.625
My bandmates happened.

869
01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:47.125
They wouldn't practice.
wouldn't learn the songs.

870
01:06:47.208 --> 01:06:49.333
-So that's why you broke up?
-That was part of it.

871
01:06:49.416 --> 01:06:51.750
But mostly it was because
those guys were fuck-holes.

872
01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:53.625
They wouldn't go an inch
out of their own way

873
01:06:53.708 --> 01:06:55.083
for anybody but themselves.

874
01:06:56.416 --> 01:07:00.125
Look. if you're gonna record with people.
you're gonna tour with people.

875
01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:03.083
you're gonna spend all day. every day.
with them for years.

876
01:07:03.166 --> 01:07:05.125
you sure as shit
better like hanging out with them.

877
01:07:05.208 --> 01:07:07.166
Otherwise. your life is gonna suck.

878
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:09.791
Then you're gonna start drinking
to forget how bad your life sucks.

879
01:07:09.875 --> 01:07:11.041
and before you know it…

880
01:07:14.416 --> 01:07:15.333
You a drinker?

881
01:07:17.083 --> 01:07:18.166
No.

882
01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:19.458
Drugs? Weed?

883
01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:21.333
-Coke?
-No.

884
01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:22.250
-Meth?
-No.

885
01:07:22.333 --> 01:07:24.083
-H?
-No.

886
01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:25.250
-Acid?
-No.

887
01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:26.541
-Molly?
-No.

888
01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:28.375
-You vaping?
-No.

889
01:07:28.458 --> 01:07:29.625
-Self-harm?
-No.

890
01:07:29.708 --> 01:07:31.666
-Sleep too much?
-No.

891
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:33.166
-Too little?
-No.

892
01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.541
Suicidal ideation?

893
01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:36.541
-Did you destroy any property?

894
01:07:37.625 --> 01:07:38.916
Not that they know about.

895
01:07:40.083 --> 01:07:40.958
What. then?

896
01:07:43.958 --> 01:07:45.791
Just fucking metal. man.

897
01:07:51.541 --> 01:07:54.791
I get this kind of shit all the time.
Okay. come on.

898
01:07:56.333 --> 01:07:57.416
Up. Let's go.

899
01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:03.208
Yo. hold up.

900
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:05.041
Where are you going?

901
01:08:05.125 --> 01:08:06.291
You're fine. dude.

902
01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:08.666
Now. this motherfucker…

903
01:08:09.833 --> 01:08:10.708
Hey.

904
01:08:11.375 --> 01:08:13.833
He's a mess.
He and I have a lot of work to do.

905
01:08:13.916 --> 01:08:17.958
Which is why I can't babysit your ass just
because you like brutal fucking music.

906
01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:20.000
I'm recommending you for discharge.

907
01:08:20.083 --> 01:08:23.208
The board will follow my recommendations.
They always do.

908
01:08:23.291 --> 01:08:26.333
-I scare the shit out of them.
-Thank you. man. Thank you.

909
01:08:26.416 --> 01:08:29.500
No problem.
We will have you out of here by Monday.

910
01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:31.375
Monday? Why Monday?

911
01:08:31.958 --> 01:08:33.958
They review recommendations
over the weekend.

912
01:08:34.666 --> 01:08:37.416
Okay. Um. is there any way
we could get that review done tonight?

913
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.500
Nah. no way in hell.

914
01:08:38.583 --> 01:08:41.958
They're already driving home
in their Jaguars listening to Sting. Why?

915
01:08:42.041 --> 01:08:46.416
The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow.
and my band is totally poised to win.

916
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.208
Okay. look. check it out.

917
01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:49.208
Hmm.

918
01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:52.291
Skullfucker.

919
01:08:52.958 --> 01:08:53.791
Nice.

920
01:08:54.916 --> 01:08:57.083
Fucking Battle of the motherfucking Bands.

921
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.666
Sorry.

922
01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:07.875
Anyway. give you another year to practice.

923
01:09:09.166 --> 01:09:10.500
See you around. bitch.

924
01:09:22.666 --> 01:09:24.333
Nah. Thank you. man.

925
01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:27.708
Hey. Clay.

926
01:09:28.666 --> 01:09:31.208
Yeah. are we going to practice before?

927
01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:36.166
No? Okay. No. We don't need to. It's fine.

928
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.875
Yeah. I'll see you
at 7:00 at the cafeteria.

929
01:09:40.958 --> 01:09:43.500
-All right. Thanks. Clay.

930
01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:12.583
<i>It's Hunter. I'm not here. Deal.</i>

931
01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:13.916
Fuck.

932
01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:24.458
Who the fuck calls on a landline?

933
01:10:25.875 --> 01:10:26.916
Hello?

934
01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:30.375
Oh. hey. Kevin. Uh…

935
01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:33.708
No. Hunter isn't here right now.

936
01:10:35.541 --> 01:10:37.208
He-- He what?

937
01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:38.833
So where is he?

938
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:46.541
<i>I feel like this is his way</i>
<i>of begging me to come back to the band.</i>

939
01:10:46.625 --> 01:10:48.208
He doesn't belong in there.

940
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:50.541
Maybe he does.

941
01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:53.916
There's definitely something wrong
with him. He's shitty to everyone.

942
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.541
Even you.
You're supposed to be his best friend.

943
01:11:02.708 --> 01:11:05.250
You said it yourself. he's a massive dick.

944
01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:09.333
I would have never understood what
a massive dick he is if it wasn't for you.

945
01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:12.166
And I wouldn't have met you
if it wasn't for metal.

946
01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:16.583
and I wouldn't have thought about metal
for five seconds if it wasn't for Hunter.

947
01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:18.416
So you owe him?

948
01:11:20.416 --> 01:11:21.458
He's my best friend.

949
01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:23.750
I gotta get him out of there.

950
01:11:27.833 --> 01:11:29.250
Will you come with me?

951
01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:34.000
Wait. so first you tell me
that I should hate him.

952
01:11:34.083 --> 01:11:35.666
and now you want me to help him?

953
01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:39.750
Uh. you'd sort of be helping me help him.

954
01:11:42.291 --> 01:11:43.375
It's okay. It's okay.

955
01:11:43.458 --> 01:11:46.208
No. I can't!
Not after what he did.

956
01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:48.666
You don't have to. It's okay. I mean it.

957
01:11:50.416 --> 01:11:51.250
Okay?

958
01:11:53.833 --> 01:11:54.666
Okay.

959
01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:57.416
I have to go.

960
01:12:38.125 --> 01:12:39.125
Can I help you?

961
01:12:39.208 --> 01:12:41.708
Yeah. Yeah. I… I hope so.

962
01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:45.291
My best friend.
he's-- he's got problems. He's a. uh…

963
01:12:46.416 --> 01:12:47.416
A sniffer.

964
01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:48.625
Gasoline?

965
01:12:48.708 --> 01:12:51.500
-Turpentine. butane. propane?
-Yep. yep. yep. all those.

966
01:12:51.583 --> 01:12:54.458
He mixes them.
and his parents don't know what to do.

967
01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:58.208
so I wanted to get them a brochure.

968
01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:01.000
You're a good friend.
They're right back there.

969
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:05.666
Wait right here. I'll get some more.

970
01:13:18.125 --> 01:13:20.333
<i>You four have outdone yourselves</i>
<i>yet again.</i>

971
01:13:20.416 --> 01:13:22.291
<i>It definitely looks like a party in here.</i>

972
01:13:22.375 --> 01:13:23.708
<i> Thank you.</i>

973
01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:26.416
<i>Now. before you tell us</i>
<i>which dessert you're taking.</i>

974
01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.416
<i>why don't you--</i>

975
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:30.875
Where's the remote?

976
01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:38.583
<i>All right. you two.</i>
<i>which dessert are you choosing?</i>

977
01:13:38.666 --> 01:13:41.208
<i>-We are choosing…</i>

978
01:13:45.583 --> 01:13:46.708
-Come on.

979
01:13:46.791 --> 01:13:48.166
Are you serious?

980
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:52.833
Kevin.

981
01:13:52.916 --> 01:13:54.541
Shh. Come on.

982
01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:56.750
Look. man. I gotta tell you. I'm just--

983
01:13:56.833 --> 01:13:59.083
-I. uh…
-Tell me later. Please. Come on.

984
01:14:02.041 --> 01:14:05.333
You know Ray.
He's the drummer from Mollycoddle.

985
01:14:05.416 --> 01:14:06.958
Anyway. he's a good guy.

986
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:08.583
Bring him.

987
01:14:09.166 --> 01:14:11.750
You do know we have to bring you back
after Battle of the Bands?

988
01:14:12.333 --> 01:14:13.208
That's cool.

989
01:14:13.708 --> 01:14:17.000
Can't deal on the outside.
I don't have the coping mechanisms.

990
01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:18.500
Okay. wait. How are we getting out?

991
01:14:24.708 --> 01:14:26.833
-Okay.
-Right. come on.

992
01:14:26.916 --> 01:14:28.375
Move out. please.

993
01:14:34.333 --> 01:14:36.250
-Let's go. Come on.
-No running.

994
01:14:36.333 --> 01:14:37.583
Outside.

995
01:14:53.958 --> 01:14:54.958
You!

996
01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:01.125
Fuck. Fuck.

997
01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:50.666
This thing… it's fucking useless.

998
01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:54.208
You'll never get clean articulation
at high speeds with a pick this thin.

999
01:15:59.791 --> 01:16:00.833
Here.

1000
01:16:02.583 --> 01:16:03.416
Try this one.

1001
01:16:07.041 --> 01:16:07.875
Thank you.

1002
01:16:08.375 --> 01:16:09.833
-This your car?
-Yeah.

1003
01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:11.625
It's a real piece of shit.

1004
01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:24.958
You deserve a better best friend.

1005
01:16:26.125 --> 01:16:28.541
Yeah. probably. but you're the one I got.

1006
01:16:32.875 --> 01:16:34.125
I'm sorry. Kevin.

1007
01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:37.583
Don't say it to me.

1008
01:17:15.416 --> 01:17:17.083
You nearly cracked my fucking skull. dude.

1009
01:17:18.041 --> 01:17:20.250
And you put a really large dent
in my guitar.

1010
01:17:21.083 --> 01:17:24.208
Your behavior has been violent
and unpredictable.

1011
01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:30.833
You are metal beyond reproach.

1012
01:17:35.625 --> 01:17:39.250
So will you please. please. please.

1013
01:17:40.333 --> 01:17:41.666
please accept my apology

1014
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:45.250
and come crack some fucking skulls with us
at the Battle of the Bands?

1015
01:17:56.791 --> 01:17:57.833
I--

1016
01:17:57.916 --> 01:17:58.750
I can't.

1017
01:18:00.083 --> 01:18:01.166
Emily.

1018
01:18:02.041 --> 01:18:02.916
I'm not ready.

1019
01:18:06.041 --> 01:18:06.958
Oh. God.

1020
01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:36.000
Mollycoddle. you guys are up next.

1021
01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:42.083
Dude.

1022
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:45.333
-Dude?
-I'm sorry.

1023
01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:48.541
You guys have been great.
and I'd love to play with you again. but…

1024
01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.208
I can only be in one band.

1025
01:18:54.416 --> 01:18:55.458
I brought you your drummer.

1026
01:18:57.083 --> 01:18:58.208
Is he wasted?

1027
01:19:01.416 --> 01:19:02.416
I feel you. man.

1028
01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:03.875
It's all good.

1029
01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:06.583
Hey. brother.

1030
01:19:07.166 --> 01:19:10.541
I've been meaning to apologize
for what happened at my party.

1031
01:19:10.625 --> 01:19:12.416
Yeah. and I apologize

1032
01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:16.041
for the whole… wedding thing.

1033
01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:18.708
-That was--
-That was weird.

1034
01:19:18.791 --> 01:19:22.291
Yup. and I'm sorry
about the things I said about your band.

1035
01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:23.875
You guys are good…

1036
01:19:25.875 --> 01:19:27.041
at what you do.

1037
01:19:27.958 --> 01:19:29.708
So may the best band win.

1038
01:19:31.958 --> 01:19:34.125
So you guys like a duo?

1039
01:19:35.958 --> 01:19:37.375
Yeah. it looks that way.

1040
01:19:37.875 --> 01:19:39.625
Like the White Stripes?

1041
01:19:41.166 --> 01:19:43.708
Yeah. like the White Stripes.

1042
01:19:43.791 --> 01:19:44.625
Nice.

1043
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:47.333
You're lucky to have this guy. man.

1044
01:19:49.583 --> 01:19:50.500
Yeah. I am.

1045
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.083
-Yo. Suspension's over. bitch.
-Hey.

1046
01:20:27.166 --> 01:20:28.375
Welcome back. big man.

1047
01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:31.458
-I got a bottle of Jack in the new truck.
-Let's go!

1048
01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:35.291
Thank you. Glenwood Lake.
GLHS is lit!

1049
01:20:35.375 --> 01:20:37.375
-I love you!
-Nix was right about this pick.

1050
01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:39.958
I can do this.
We're gonna crush this shit.

1051
01:20:40.041 --> 01:20:40.875
But I don't know.

1052
01:20:40.958 --> 01:20:43.791
How will it sound with nothing
on the bottom. no chords. no riff?

1053
01:20:44.583 --> 01:20:46.333
No. it-- it'll be like. uh…

1054
01:20:46.833 --> 01:20:48.000
Like jazz…

1055
01:20:48.791 --> 01:20:49.625
…ish.

1056
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:25.875
Now I'm ready.

1057
01:21:25.958 --> 01:21:27.500
-Dude.

1058
01:21:30.666 --> 01:21:31.708
Let's do this shit.

1059
01:21:32.916 --> 01:21:35.416
One. two. three…

1060
01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.750
Skullfucker!

1061
01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:41.041
Nope. That is not appropriate.
It's got to go.

1062
01:21:41.125 --> 01:21:43.166
-No. it can't go.

1063
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:44.500
It is painted on the heads.

1064
01:21:44.583 --> 01:21:46.916
Well. I can't let you
bring those in there. so…

1065
01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:55.041
-Wha--

1066
01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:56.666
Oy.

1067
01:21:58.541 --> 01:22:02.166
-Eli. I need a favor.
-Of course. Emily. What do you need?

1068
01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.125
I need to get into the art room.

1069
01:22:06.625 --> 01:22:10.458
Ladies and gentlemen.
a round of applause for Skullflower.

1070
01:22:32.083 --> 01:22:35.500
This is a little song… about…

1071
01:22:36.208 --> 01:22:41.416
…the machinery of torment!

1072
01:23:54.833 --> 01:23:57.875
Hey. isn't that Hunter Sylvester
and Kevin Schlieb?

1073
01:23:58.375 --> 01:24:01.041
And what's-her-name.
the-- the shitty clarinetist.

1074
01:24:01.125 --> 01:24:03.416
Could've been in a band with those guys.

1075
01:24:14.791 --> 01:24:16.083
This blows.

1076
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:28.833
Dude.

1077
01:24:29.916 --> 01:24:30.958
-No.

1078
01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:44.333
Woo-woo.

1079
01:24:44.416 --> 01:24:46.583
Yeah! Metal! Woo!

1080
01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:57.708
-Ah!

1081
01:27:06.083 --> 01:27:07.791
-Oh. shit.

1082
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:11.416
Oh. shit. Oh…

1083
01:27:18.416 --> 01:27:20.583
Call an ambulance. Someone call 911.

1084
01:27:20.666 --> 01:27:22.875
Hunter. don't look at your leg. okay?

1085
01:27:37.833 --> 01:27:39.041
My toes are so numb.

1086
01:27:39.916 --> 01:27:42.125
Gotta wiggle them.
Come on. little fuckers.

1087
01:27:55.958 --> 01:27:58.958
This fucking bow is fucked.

1088
01:27:59.041 --> 01:28:00.583
-Ow. dude.

1089
01:28:00.666 --> 01:28:02.500
-Dude.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1090
01:28:05.708 --> 01:28:06.625
Ah! That's better.

1091
01:28:23.708 --> 01:28:26.208
Congratulations.

1092
01:28:26.291 --> 01:28:27.791
Bronze medalists.

1093
01:28:27.875 --> 01:28:30.458
Silver medalists. We came in second.

1094
01:28:30.958 --> 01:28:34.458
Oh. hey. uh.
looks like you're going viral.

1095
01:28:37.458 --> 01:28:40.291
Well… at least I didn't get arrested.

1096
01:28:41.291 --> 01:28:42.166
So.

1097
01:28:43.416 --> 01:28:44.500
progress?

1098
01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:46.083
Well.

1099
01:28:47.208 --> 01:28:48.708
no bad publicity. right?

1100
01:28:52.708 --> 01:28:54.916
All right. well.

1101
01:28:56.166 --> 01:28:57.083
I got a date.

1102
01:28:57.166 --> 01:28:59.375
Yeah. she's a pediatrician.

1103
01:29:00.041 --> 01:29:01.791
Big tits. Natural.

1104
01:29:01.875 --> 01:29:03.666
Not a client.

1105
01:29:08.958 --> 01:29:10.500
I can't believe we lost.

1106
01:29:15.041 --> 01:29:16.666
It's fine. It's cool.

1107
01:29:17.333 --> 01:29:20.583
They're nice guys. The people have spoken.
This is what they want.

1108
01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.291
-No. fuck 'em.

1109
01:29:23.375 --> 01:29:25.000
Fuck 'em. every single one.

1110
01:29:25.083 --> 01:29:27.208
Who are people gonna remember? Us.

1111
01:29:27.291 --> 01:29:29.125
That is us right there. headlining.

1112
01:29:29.208 --> 01:29:31.875
-We were good.
-No. we were fucking great.

1113
01:29:31.958 --> 01:29:34.291
You smashed that intro. dude.

1114
01:29:34.375 --> 01:29:37.208
Yes. she did. That was some Yo-Yo Ma shit.

1115
01:29:37.291 --> 01:29:39.458
-And your solo…
-Holy fuck. that was unreal.

1116
01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:41.500
But what about this motherfucker?

1117
01:29:41.583 --> 01:29:44.791
Oh. my man slapped them in their faces
with his double bass dick.

1118
01:29:47.666 --> 01:29:49.750
Yes. Uh. yes. I did.

1119
01:29:50.708 --> 01:29:52.500
-You know what?

1120
01:29:52.583 --> 01:29:55.708
Let them have their fads.
Fads come and go.

1121
01:29:55.791 --> 01:29:56.875
But not us.

1122
01:29:57.416 --> 01:29:58.250
We're forever.

1123
01:29:58.333 --> 01:30:00.833
Now it starts for us.
Now people know our name.

1124
01:30:01.958 --> 01:30:03.333
We're Skullflower.

1125
01:30:03.916 --> 01:30:05.416
Skullflower!

1126
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.083
<i>Fuck. we rip.</i>
