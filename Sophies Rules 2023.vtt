00:00:10.707 --> 00:00:12.175
Hey. Kitty.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.375
I'm here when you need me. Call me.

5
00:00:15.123 --> 00:00:16.125
Love you.

6
00:00:17.257 --> 00:00:19.460
Hi. hon. Call me when you get this message.

7
00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:20.671
Love you.

8
00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:23.468
Hey. hon. It's me. Call me.

9
00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:26.087
Hey. hon. I'm in between meetings.

10
00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:27.406
I just. I wanted to say hi.

11
00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:29.458
I love you.

12
00:00:30.153 --> 00:00:34.023
Kathy. Call me. text me.
send me a smoke signal.

13
00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:35.733
Let me know you're all right.

14
00:00:37.073 --> 00:00:39.093
I wanna make sure I don't lose you too.

15
00:00:57.437 --> 00:00:58.703
Kathy. thank God.

16
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.976
I was getting worried. Is everything okay?

17
00:01:01.112 --> 00:01:02.273
I am okay.

18
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.046
There's no easy way to say this. Kathy.

19
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.453
My meetings are running longer.

20
00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:07.281
and I won't be back for a few more days.

21
00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:09.351
I'm sorry I can't be there with you.

22
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.726
That's okay.

23
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.850
I'm keeping busy.

24
00:01:11.953 --> 00:01:13.080
Are you seeing Dr. Myers?

25
00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:16.648
He's a grief counselor. I'm not grieving.

26
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.906
You need to deal with
Derek's loss. not keep denying it.

27
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.968
He can help. He helped me.

28
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.226
Helped you what?

29
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.703
Accept that he's gone?

30
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.998
He's not!

31
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.653
The insurance company
cleared his passing.

32
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.570
We received the death gratuity.

33
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.804
They're wrong!

34
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.183
I am not touching that
check. because he's not gone!

35
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.445
Derek is out there lost.
maybe on the streets.

36
00:01:44.523 --> 00:01:46.203
Do you know how many vets are homeless?

37
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.671
It's unlikely. Kitty.

38
00:01:47.763 --> 00:01:49.203
You have no faith.

39
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.687
He's out there. and you can't accept that.

40
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.570
I'll be home soon. We'll
get through this together.

41
00:01:58.062 --> 00:01:59.078
I love you.

42
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:02.553
I have to go. My bath is ready.

43
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.023
♪ And it takes me back home ♪

44
00:02:10.744 --> 00:02:15.744

45
00:02:15.972 --> 00:02:20.390
♪ And it takes me back home ♪

46
00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:44.312
Hey.

47
00:02:48.454 --> 00:02:49.804
Hello.

48
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.203
Lady. hey. Lady.

49
00:02:53.457 --> 00:02:56.040
Wake up. would you? Well. wake up.

50
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:59.614
Oh. lady. What's?

51
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.273
Hey. what? I can help.

52
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.984
I used to be a medic in Nam.

53
00:03:27.064 --> 00:03:28.132
You okay?

54
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.630
Are you okay?

55
00:03:31.953 --> 00:03:32.993
Are you okay?

56
00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.779
I don't know.

57
00:03:34.857 --> 00:03:35.991
There's vacancy. but

58
00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:37.725
you have to wait to speak with Ms Sophie.

59
00:03:37.788 --> 00:03:38.793
You seem lost.

60
00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:40.183
I don't know where I am.

61
00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:41.882
What happened to your head?

62
00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.412
I. I. I tripped and fell.

63
00:03:49.144 --> 00:03:51.039
Look. I can sneak you in.

64
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.695
and get you cleaned up.

65
00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:07.983
and maybe something to eat.

66
00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:11.725
But we have to be quick. 'cause technically

67
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.624
you can't be here until
Ms Sophie says you can.

68
00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:15.999
It's one of her rules.

69
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.662
What is this place?

70
00:04:24.483 --> 00:04:27.178
Officially it's the
Cottonwood Rescue Shelter.

71
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.069
This is a safe haven for us.

72
00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.999
What do you mean us?

73
00:04:31.257 --> 00:04:33.428
The lost. the plundered. the forgotten.

74
00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:34.609
The streets aren't safe.

75
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.467
Just a few days ago. a homeless
man was beaten to death.

76
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.610
Can you believe that?

77
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:41.018
Do you live here?

78
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.655
Nobody really lives
here. except Ms Sophie.

79
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:46.331
It's her place and her
son. Bobby. and Blue.

80
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.023
He's our security man. But he wanders off.

81
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.440
She lets strangers stay here?

82
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.296
Like that famous quote says.
there are no strangers here.

83
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.603
just friends you haven't met yet.

84
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.585
Hi. I'm Amber. What's your name?

85
00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:29.952
You look like an Alice. I
used to have an Aunt Alice.

86
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:31.796
Amber!

87
00:05:32.577 --> 00:05:33.903
She shouldn't be here.

88
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.889
Come on. You know the rules.

89
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.975
Hi. Pleasure.

90
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.452
Sophie's gonna be here any second now.

91
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.467
This is not the way they should meet.

92
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.085
I'm sorry. What's your name?

93
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.327
Her name's Alice.

94
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.882
Pleasure. I'm Maude.

95
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.600
This isn't the way. how
Sophie should meet Alice. okay?

96
00:05:50.803 --> 00:05:53.640
She's bleeding. and she needs help.

97
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.139
I doubt Ms Sophie would
turn her away like this.

98
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.468
What happened? Did
somebody do this to you?

99
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.591
Is somebody maybe after you?

100
00:06:01.374 --> 00:06:02.694
Are we in danger?

101
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.936
Relax. She fell. Just go
keep an eye out for Ms Sophie.

102
00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:09.703
I'm not gonna be a part of
one of your other schemes here.

103
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.093
Just let me know when
Ms Sophie gets here.

104
00:06:14.258 --> 00:06:16.116
Okay. fine. You talked me into it.

105
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.206
Looks superficial. no stitches needed.

106
00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:23.260
Than...

107
00:06:23.302 --> 00:06:26.225
Someday. I'm gonna be a
nurse. just like Ms Sophie.

108
00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:28.149
She's taught me everything I know.

109
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.186
You could say I'm kind of
like her medical assistant.

110
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.694
Purple! My scrubs will be purple.

111
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:35.466
What's your favorite color? - Hum...

112
00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:37.584
How long have you been out on the streets?

113
00:06:37.653 --> 00:06:39.607
I only ask 'cause you
don't have a lot of stuff.

114
00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.089
and that's a good thing.

115
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.802
Not that it's a good
thing not to have things.

116
00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:45.459
Sophie's here.

117
00:06:45.584 --> 00:06:46.770
Maude.

118
00:06:46.818 --> 00:06:49.380
go into Andrew's hocus
pocus bag and grab his flask.

119
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:51.698
I'll just go. I don't want
to get anyone in trouble.

120
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.711
Weren't you listening.
the streets aren't safe.

121
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.795
One thing we do here is.
we look after each other.

122
00:07:06.432 --> 00:07:07.521
Amber.

123
00:07:08.502 --> 00:07:09.740
Amber!

124
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.370
I wasn't here.

125
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.533
I want you to smell like booze.

126
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.732
Remember. we don't
want to think you're trouble.

127
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.498
or she'll send you straight
to the police station.

128
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.662
They do terrible things to you there.

129
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.107
It's okay. Just let me do all the talking.

130
00:07:27.262 --> 00:07:28.679
Amber!

131
00:07:30.903 --> 00:07:33.126
Stay right here. Okay?

132
00:07:42.912 --> 00:07:44.584
You know the rules.

133
00:07:45.803 --> 00:07:49.138
Everyone with two able hands helps.

134
00:07:50.253 --> 00:07:51.633
I was helping.

135
00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:54.663
Yes. Ms Sophie. Good evening to you too.

136
00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:59.475
Are you... hiding someone...

137
00:08:00.197 --> 00:08:01.507
in the bathroom?

138
00:08:03.414 --> 00:08:04.977
Hiding?

139
00:08:05.103 --> 00:08:08.632
No. No. no. no. Fixing. yeah.

140
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.694
That's more like it. I was fixing.

141
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.850
I would never bring someone
into your house. your bathroom.

142
00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:22.881
especially when they're
bleeding all over the floor.

143
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.311
You are a horrible liar.

144
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.374
Lying is bad.

145
00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:30.267
Maude already told me.

146
00:08:30.366 --> 00:08:32.220
I'm sorry. But you know how it is.

147
00:08:32.296 --> 00:08:33.749
When Sophie looks at you.

148
00:08:33.819 --> 00:08:35.914
How could you snitch on
me? You're my best friend.

149
00:08:35.956 --> 00:08:38.073
I am your best friend.
but you asked me to lie.

150
00:08:38.128 --> 00:08:39.620
I didn't have time to clean up.

151
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:42.471
That's enough.

152
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.843
Who's in the room?

153
00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:53.526
This woman was drunk. and she fell.

154
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.398
And I met her outside.

155
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.417
when I was reading my nursing textbook.

156
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.229
You know. the one about
ligaments and muscles.

157
00:09:01.345 --> 00:09:03.055
People have those. right?

158
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.883
The muscles. and eyelashes. and elbows.

159
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.223
She needs help.

160
00:09:20.122 --> 00:09:21.122
Are you all right?

161
00:09:26.194 --> 00:09:27.904
What happened to you?

162
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.581
She fell down. somewhere.

163
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.237
I fell.

164
00:09:48.603 --> 00:09:49.870
How many fingers do you see?

165
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.096
Two.

166
00:09:54.617 --> 00:09:56.717
No immediate signs of concussion.

167
00:09:56.825 --> 00:09:58.331
For a more in depth diagnostic.

168
00:09:58.378 --> 00:10:01.180
you'll have to go to the county
hospital around the corner.

169
00:10:02.017 --> 00:10:03.594
Have you been drinking?

170
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.760
Yes Ma'am.

171
00:10:08.057 --> 00:10:09.947
What were you drinking?

172
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.979
Wine. Lots of it.

173
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.313
Please don't send me to the police.

174
00:10:15.479 --> 00:10:16.721
What's your name?

175
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.970
Alice.

176
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.143
Well. Alice. I'm Sophie
Hagan. This is my place.

177
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.034
Our place.

178
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.315
We help everyone who needs it.

179
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.890
But there are rules to follow.

180
00:10:28.947 --> 00:10:30.562
and you will have to come back tomorrow.

181
00:10:30.604 --> 00:10:32.542
Please. Sophie.

182
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.990
She has know where to go.

183
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.565
Is that right?

184
00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:37.682
Please.

185
00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:39.708
I vouch for her.

186
00:10:41.925 --> 00:10:44.518
Well. it looks like someone
has taken a liking to you.

187
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.448
I remind her of her Aunt.

188
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.604
Well. I'm not gonna break total protocol.

189
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.331
Amber. take Alice to the shower.

190
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.958
Bring her a towel. something to wear.

191
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.346
Put her clothes in the wash.

192
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.901
Then bring her to my study.
so we can have our interview.

193
00:10:58.572 --> 00:11:01.005
Yes. Ms Sophie. Right away. Ms Sophie.

194
00:11:03.854 --> 00:11:04.964
Bobby?

195
00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:07.510
Yeah?

196
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.542
You're in charge of
putting everything away.

197
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.456
When you're done. get
back to that essay. please.

198
00:11:13.565 --> 00:11:14.945
Yes. Mom.

199
00:11:15.078 --> 00:11:16.078
Thank you.

200
00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.390
Try and keep that dry. I'll
see you in a few minutes.

201
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.234
Okay. come with me.

202
00:11:30.343 --> 00:11:34.113
Don't you just love this
beautiful how. how...

203
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.179
Hey. Bobby.

204
00:11:39.534 --> 00:11:40.593
Hi. Amber.

205
00:11:41.765 --> 00:11:42.804
Do you need help?

206
00:11:43.789 --> 00:11:46.713
Amber focus. Get Alice ready.

207
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.914
Next time.

208
00:11:55.573 --> 00:11:56.835
Is he your boyfriend?

209
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.633
Oh. I wouldn't stand a chance.

210
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.218
I'm not really his type.

211
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.650
What type is that?

212
00:12:01.713 --> 00:12:02.886
The non junkie kind.

213
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.843
Hey.

214
00:12:18.456 --> 00:12:19.828
I'm mad at you.

215
00:12:19.891 --> 00:12:21.242
Don't be.

216
00:12:21.343 --> 00:12:22.360
Okay.

217
00:12:22.423 --> 00:12:23.580
Hey. Alice.

218
00:12:23.648 --> 00:12:26.047
Now you have to remember
to be completely honest.

219
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.226
If you don't want to say something.

220
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.633
don't worry. Sophie won't mind.

221
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.883
But just make sure you don't lie to her.

222
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.803
Another one of her rules.

223
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:57.961
Have a seat.

224
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.836
Have a little drink. for your nerves.

225
00:13:15.103 --> 00:13:17.351
That's what I thought.

226
00:13:17.442 --> 00:13:19.750
What brought you here?

227
00:13:19.905 --> 00:13:21.405
Amber let me in.

228
00:13:29.445 --> 00:13:33.573
What are the events
that led you to end up here?

229
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.133
I fell. and haven't
been able to get back up.

230
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.013
Everyone here has fallen.

231
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.226
Some of us get up and keep going.

232
00:13:50.338 --> 00:13:54.031
Others keep tripping and
falling right back down again.

233
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.613
I turned this home into a
shelter to help everyone stand.

234
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.583
Do you need help?

235
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.080
Can you talk about it?

236
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.023
Do you want to talk about it?

237
00:14:11.787 --> 00:14:16.563
Are you willing to accept
the help that is here for you?

238
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.367
Because if not.

239
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.643
then there is no point to
this. and there is the door.

240
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.343
This is not a house of lingering.

241
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.960
but a house of getting better.

242
00:14:29.105 --> 00:14:32.031
Everyone here has accepted
they need help and are trying.

243
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.263
Are you willing to try?

244
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.031
I don't abide by regulations.

245
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.148
But I do have rules
that have to be followed.

246
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.515
Do you understand?

247
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:48.664
Yes.

248
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.652
We don't have deep pockets funding us.

249
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.894
I raise money.

250
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:56.582
Good people and local
shops donate to keep us going.

251
00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:03.066
Before I let you stay. I need to know...
Yes!

252
00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.703
Are you in danger of hurting yourself?

253
00:15:17.952 --> 00:15:20.110
Are you in danger of hurting others?

254
00:15:20.188 --> 00:15:21.801
No.

255
00:15:21.852 --> 00:15:23.472
Is someone looking to hurt you?

256
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.558
No.

257
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.136
Are you wanted by the authorities?

258
00:15:29.243 --> 00:15:30.660
No.

259
00:15:31.594 --> 00:15:33.543
Alice is not your real name. is it?

260
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.902
What's your real name?

261
00:15:45.011 --> 00:15:46.344
I like Alice.

262
00:15:50.805 --> 00:15:52.965
Okay. I understand.

263
00:15:53.177 --> 00:15:54.730
You can be Alice here.

264
00:15:56.676 --> 00:15:58.833
And that's as formal as it's going to get.

265
00:16:00.332 --> 00:16:02.372
Is there anything to fill out?

266
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.472
No. this is a place to find peace.

267
00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:06.000
and help you find yourself.

268
00:16:06.109 --> 00:16:07.222
Is that what you seek?

269
00:16:07.814 --> 00:16:09.194
More than anything.

270
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.316
No one here is to be judged.

271
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.250
But we have to be honest
with ourselves in order to heal.

272
00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:17.113
She can stay.

273
00:16:18.883 --> 00:16:21.121
See. I knew she'd let her stay.

274
00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.246
Sophie's an angel.

275
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.746
Maude. I want you to
take Alice to the kitchen.

276
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.097
Can you ask Andrew to
give Alice something to eat?

277
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.551
And then you can all give
her the rundown of the rules.

278
00:16:29.662 --> 00:16:32.793
- There's more rules?
- I will do as you ask.

279
00:16:34.778 --> 00:16:36.990
Andrew. we've talked about you doing-

280
00:16:37.032 --> 00:16:38.637
your magic in my study! I know.

281
00:16:38.704 --> 00:16:43.637
But I wanted to give the
grand entrance to the new lady.

282
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:46.054
I am the Amazing Andrew.

283
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.743
It's a pleasure to meet you. Alice.

284
00:16:58.243 --> 00:16:59.438
Come. Let's eat.

285
00:17:03.347 --> 00:17:05.548
Don't mind them. They're just curious.

286
00:17:05.649 --> 00:17:07.209
How many people live here?

287
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.946
At a time? No
more than a dozen. max.

288
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.173
But it varies.

289
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.353
Here you go. Eat
up while it's still warm.

290
00:17:23.988 --> 00:17:25.368
Can I get a spoon. please?

291
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.376
Of course. Spoons are my specialty.

292
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.696
They really are.

293
00:17:35.423 --> 00:17:36.540
Thank you.

294
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.493
You're welcome. Okay.

295
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.774
Here's the deal. Alice.

296
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.423
Sophie's house is modeled
after the temporary shelters.

297
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.000
Over there. you get a maximum

298
00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:50.329
of 72 hours before you have to leave.

299
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.415
Here. we get 82 hours.

300
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.891
As of today. we got two days left.

301
00:17:55.946 --> 00:17:56.959
What happens then?

302
00:17:57.001 --> 00:17:59.704
Well. we have to leave
the premises for 48 hours.

303
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.891
No exception. It's a hard rule.

304
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.352
If we don't. we're considered residents.

305
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.132
and we lose this safe haven.

306
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.230
Where do you go?

307
00:18:07.288 --> 00:18:08.468
Wherever the day takes us.

308
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.570
Can you come back?

309
00:18:09.624 --> 00:18:11.280
Well. of course. after two days.

310
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.679
during which time Sophie cleans the place.

311
00:18:13.744 --> 00:18:15.263
and looks for paraphernalia

312
00:18:15.305 --> 00:18:16.976
and other things that shouldn't be here.

313
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.329
Like your flask.

314
00:18:19.109 --> 00:18:20.342
You little snitch.

315
00:18:20.398 --> 00:18:21.518
Shhhh.

316
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.086
It's such a drag. but we have to do this

317
00:18:24.131 --> 00:18:25.928
'cause the city already dinged her once

318
00:18:25.976 --> 00:18:27.780
for having too many people in here.

319
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.528
Is giving
shelter to people illegal?

320
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.289
No. it's not.

321
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.023
They act like it's the end of the world.

322
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.341
All the storage bins are taken.

323
00:18:35.383 --> 00:18:37.161
You'll have to bring
all your stuff with you.

324
00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:38.554
I don't have anything.

325
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.741
That's good. the less
attachments you have.

326
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:42.328
the easier it is to survive.

327
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.250
As long as you don't fight.

328
00:18:44.312 --> 00:18:46.226
or you don't do drugs on the premises.

329
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.670
the doors will remain open.

330
00:18:49.805 --> 00:18:51.255
Here's the rest of the rules.

331
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.734
How long have you been coming back?

332
00:18:56.787 --> 00:18:57.906
A year and a half.

333
00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.156
14 Months.

334
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.008
A year and a half.

335
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.898
Why do you keep coming back?

336
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.103
It's hard out there.

337
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.242
I left nine months ago. and
next thing I know I'm using.

338
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.258
and my boyfriend's pimping me out again.

339
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.765
She has a soft spot for that loser.

340
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.320
You'll meet him. He's always coming around.

341
00:19:20.406 --> 00:19:21.734
He knows you're here?

342
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.836
He used to come with me.

343
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.893
We both got clean at one point.

344
00:19:27.092 --> 00:19:28.778
I'm staying clean as long as I'm here.

345
00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.586
Don't you have parents
you can go home to?

346
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.453
They kicked me out.

347
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.273
I can't blame them.

348
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.336
I was stealing from them. and
always promising to clean up.

349
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.578
only to come home high the next day.

350
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.083
I'm gonna go for a smoke break.

351
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.578
I told you. I'm not interested.

352
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.130
It's not about
being interested or not.

353
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.613
You need to take the deal.

354
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.149
Do you know how many
people depend on this house?

355
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.821
What you do is commendable. but the bank

356
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.634
isn't interested in your
humanitarian endeavors.

357
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.530
They just want their money.

358
00:20:16.587 --> 00:20:19.602
You are months behind in your payments.

359
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.693
You don't have many options left.

360
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.594
I know. I know.

361
00:20:25.681 --> 00:20:28.171
I know everything you've
done for us. Georgina.

362
00:20:28.265 --> 00:20:30.345
And it's very much appreciated. but

363
00:20:31.414 --> 00:20:33.938
there's got to be something more.

364
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.954
We're barely charging
you interest as it is.

365
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.977
Donations are slow to come in this time.

366
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.344
If you were to register the Cottonwood

367
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.420
as a proper shelter. you
would get government help.

368
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.602
I can't do that. You know that.

369
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.263
I don't agree with
some of their regulations.

370
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.040
Humm.

371
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.333
We can do a reverse mortgage.

372
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.821
Don't I have to be dead for that?

373
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.696
No. it's not like that.

374
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.024
I can promise you that we at the World Bank

375
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.649
have your best interest at heart.

376
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:10.782
Let me show you.

377
00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.165
We're gonna have to take
an assessment of the property.

378
00:21:15.267 --> 00:21:16.557
And once we assess the property.

379
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.773
then we can see how much
is this property actually worth.

380
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.173
Blue is not at his post?

381
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.868
He must be doing his rounds.

382
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.870
Sophie knows
what she's talking about.

383
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.985
She's a been there.
done that type of person.

384
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.665
She has a scary look
to her. but she's all heart.

385
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:49.001
Rumors say she was quite
the beauty when she was my age.

386
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.946
Whenever she walked out of the house.

387
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.696
it was like someone dropped
ice cream on the sidewalk.

388
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.751
All the neighborhood boys
would swarm around her like ants.

389
00:21:56.829 --> 00:21:58.229
Sophie?

390
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.690
She could have had her
pick up any boy she wanted.

391
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.153
Unfortunately she was into bad boys.

392
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.493
Sounds familiar.

393
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.073
Johnny Hagan was his name.

394
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.854
He went to jail for shooting a guy.

395
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.456
And then he was stabbed
to death two weeks in.

396
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.175
leaving her pregnant with Bobby.

397
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.237
Amber. you should go inside.

398
00:22:17.321 --> 00:22:19.253
- Speak of the devil himself.
- What's wrong?

399
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.198
Amber's ex. L'il shawty!

400
00:22:21.256 --> 00:22:22.516
What do you want?

401
00:22:22.581 --> 00:22:24.900
Nothing with you Grand-Maude.
so mind your business.

402
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.463
Hey. watch yourself.

403
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.643
You should all mind your business.

404
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.776
I'm here to talk to my baby girl.

405
00:22:32.853 --> 00:22:34.953
Ex. ex baby girl.

406
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.087
Come on. You're my bae.

407
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.253
You promised to be my forevah.

408
00:22:40.893 --> 00:22:43.581
My princess... get in da car.

409
00:22:43.643 --> 00:22:45.693
You're scoopable as they getz.

410
00:22:47.128 --> 00:22:50.151
Like before. just yous and me. baby girl.

411
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.633
Leave her alone.

412
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.432
Baby. It's me. You know I wont hurt you.

413
00:22:58.633 --> 00:23:00.633
I still got mad love for you.

414
00:23:01.518 --> 00:23:02.637
Do you still love me?

415
00:23:03.918 --> 00:23:04.956
I love you.

416
00:23:06.063 --> 00:23:07.620
Tell me you love me too.

417
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:11.846
I d...
That's enough. Clarence.

418
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.331
That's not my name. bitch.

419
00:23:13.603 --> 00:23:14.845
But it was before you dropped

420
00:23:14.892 --> 00:23:16.862
your snotty face out of school.

421
00:23:17.225 --> 00:23:18.665
This is between me and Amber.

422
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.980
This is my home.

423
00:23:20.026 --> 00:23:21.786
Whatever business you
bring goes through me.

424
00:23:22.325 --> 00:23:24.365
If it isn't Ms Badass Sophie.

425
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.890
You need to get going.

426
00:23:25.952 --> 00:23:26.979
Is that right?

427
00:23:27.566 --> 00:23:28.603
Blue!

428
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.413
Ms Soph' says you
gotta go. Mr. Yo. So go.

429
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.050
When you get bored at
playing house. come find me.

430
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.776
You better watch yourself. old hag.

431
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.104
Or you're gonna get yourself
in a shit load of trouble.

432
00:23:47.448 --> 00:23:48.534
Creep!

433
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.463
Okay. everyone. Let's get back in.

434
00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:01.143
Yes.

435
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:03.635
I do.

436
00:24:04.032 --> 00:24:06.651
I've wanted you since I was 14.

437
00:24:07.497 --> 00:24:09.292
♪ Da da da ♪

438
00:24:09.457 --> 00:24:10.893
♪ Da da da da ♪

439
00:24:11.026 --> 00:24:12.550
I got the cake.

440
00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:17.120
We're gonna be together forever and ever.

441
00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.520
And I got the flowers.

442
00:24:19.899 --> 00:24:21.135
And ever.

443
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.870
I do. Mr. Yo.

444
00:24:23.173 --> 00:24:24.487
I do.

445
00:24:26.987 --> 00:24:28.448
But wait. What about Bobby?

446
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.850
Is Amber okay?

447
00:24:29.948 --> 00:24:31.290
He's her kryptonite.

448
00:24:31.393 --> 00:24:33.065
She's not as strong as she used to be.

449
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.495
She's been trying to stay clean.

450
00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:36.401
but she's been failing at it.

451
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.753
Last time she went with him
was on an eight day binger.

452
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.667
Are you okay?

453
00:24:44.862 --> 00:24:46.729
Maybe we should get Sophie.

454
00:24:46.826 --> 00:24:50.560
No. it's okay. She
just needs to process it.

455
00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:08.258
What's going on?

456
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.253
That's Huevo. He's
one of our broken vets.

457
00:25:12.383 --> 00:25:13.826
Why do you call him 'egg'?

458
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.500
Well. he does anything for eggs.

459
00:25:16.565 --> 00:25:20.643
Scrambled. fried. poached. boiled.

460
00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.737
I've even seen him eat raw eggs.

461
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.729
Now sometimes he

462
00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:31.917
yells out of the blue. mostly at night.

463
00:25:32.065 --> 00:25:33.123
Lucky us.

464
00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.143
Great.

465
00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.940
She isn't always
gonna be there to cradle him.

466
00:25:48.053 --> 00:25:50.333
Sophie has a
way of talking with him.

467
00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.076
getting to him.

468
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.087
What's going on in
that brain of yours. child?

469
00:26:21.332 --> 00:26:22.832
I have to leave.

470
00:26:23.758 --> 00:26:27.128
To go where? With Mr. Yo?

471
00:26:27.722 --> 00:26:30.572
Why do you care so much for him?

472
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.198
He was there for me
when I was at my lowest.

473
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.682
He was the reason
you were at your lowest.

474
00:26:36.879 --> 00:26:39.249
And he'll drag you right back down again.

475
00:26:39.358 --> 00:26:41.190
I can help him.

476
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.456
Isn't that a rule? Help those in need?

477
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.620
You can only help those
who want to be helped.

478
00:26:47.735 --> 00:26:49.085
He needs me.

479
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.979
Yes. to make him money.

480
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.153
It's not love. It's a business arrangement.

481
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.733
It's so hard.

482
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.979
They say you are what you are.

483
00:27:00.387 --> 00:27:02.883
Maybe. maybe I'm just a junkie.

484
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.175
You are so much more than that.

485
00:27:07.704 --> 00:27:09.241
You're young. You're bright.

486
00:27:09.319 --> 00:27:11.029
You have a great future ahead of you.

487
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.850
as long as you set your mind to it.

488
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.206
What happened with finishing high school?

489
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.667
Your dreams of being a nurse?

490
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.850
I don't belong in school.

491
00:27:20.932 --> 00:27:24.093
You don't belong
here. School is a way out.

492
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.245
Why don't I ask Bobby to
bring the application again?

493
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.083
Will you fill it out this time?

494
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:38.043
Don't let it become one
big problem. Keep it small.

495
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.063
It's a 'mini prob'.

496
00:27:42.956 --> 00:27:44.050
'Mini prob.'

497
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.870
Come here.

498
00:27:51.745 --> 00:27:53.905
Miss Sophie.
can I please come in?

499
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.300
Yes. of course.

500
00:27:56.917 --> 00:27:59.138
I'm not having a very good day today.

501
00:27:59.193 --> 00:28:01.425
It's okay. hon. It's okay.

502
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.276
Thank you.

503
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.534
You're a really good gardener.

504
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.353
Of all the chores.
gardening is my favorite.

505
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.081
This is a really big place.

506
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.073
Used to belong to a lady
by the name of Cottonwood.

507
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.120
Sophie was her nurse for 20 years.

508
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.133
She inherited the place when she died.

509
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.835
She could have made a
bundle of cash if she sold it.

510
00:28:44.992 --> 00:28:46.932
And she turned it into a shelter?

511
00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.083
It's more of a Transition place.

512
00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.970
It's a temporary shelter
for people to get a leg up.

513
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.073
No one likes their own situation.

514
00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.643
Getting out as soon as
possible is most ideal.

515
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.863
See that guy. Tom?

516
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.323
He's a grad with a BA.

517
00:29:08.333 --> 00:29:09.596
His drinking got him in here.

518
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:15.476
Now he goes to AA meetings
regularly. and job interviews.

519
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:16.679
He's gonna get out.

520
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.883
Some of us are a little complacent.

521
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.773
Hey. Tom. Are you going for an interview?

522
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.437
Yeah. Today's life insurance.

523
00:29:29.562 --> 00:29:30.590
Yeah!

524
00:29:30.632 --> 00:29:32.161
It's door to door. but I'll take it.

525
00:29:32.203 --> 00:29:33.727
You need help with that tie?

526
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:35.119
I do. I totally do.

527
00:29:37.031 --> 00:29:38.335
That's good.

528
00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:40.028
Thank you. I'm looking forward to it.

529
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:41.418
I think it's gonna go well.

530
00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.598
Okay. good luck.

531
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.896
Good luck. - Good luck. Tom.

532
00:29:43.975 --> 00:29:45.890
Thanks guys. - Good luck. Tom.

533
00:30:04.977 --> 00:30:06.577
Oops. sorry.

534
00:30:10.906 --> 00:30:12.656
Vroom vroom.

535
00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:16.421
Vroom vroom.

536
00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:30.953
Hey guys. Sophie's
having issues with payments.

537
00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.260
It takes a lot of moolah
to run a place like this.

538
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:34.984
She had to take a loan out on the house.

539
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.867
Can't she file as a shelter?

540
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.625
No. This is a home. not a business.

541
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.226
Which the other shelters are.

542
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.390
Businesses have the right

543
00:30:42.476 --> 00:30:44.820
to refuse services to anyone they want.

544
00:30:45.031 --> 00:30:46.843
Some places claim to help the homeless.

545
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.820
but they're more concerned
with their quotas and agendas.

546
00:30:50.532 --> 00:30:52.750
Well. I had a friend...

547
00:30:53.917 --> 00:30:54.937
Maude.

548
00:30:55.812 --> 00:30:57.250
Lucia was her name.

549
00:30:58.007 --> 00:30:59.280
Her life was in a rut.

550
00:30:59.359 --> 00:31:01.723
and she decided to go
to Chicago to start over.

551
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.113
As a Cali girl. she
didn't even have a coat.

552
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.449
So I bought her one with
the little money that I had.

553
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.066
Nothing worked for her.

554
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.953
She ended up becoming
depressed. developed a habit.

555
00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.003
Didn't have any money.
started living on the streets.

556
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.503
One shelter one night refused
her entry because she was gay.

557
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.598
What did she do?

558
00:31:25.897 --> 00:31:27.245
It was in the news.

559
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.660
they found her dead
one night on a cold night.

560
00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:33.426
If only she had a real coat.

561
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.441
It wasn't your fault.

562
00:31:35.568 --> 00:31:39.594
No. I know. It's just. Sophie
would never let that happen.

563
00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.704
This place is special.

564
00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:42.930
She's made it a home.

565
00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.282
And no one can tell her
what she can or cannot do.

566
00:31:55.594 --> 00:31:56.618
Keep it.

567
00:31:56.673 --> 00:31:58.719
Isn't there something we can do?

568
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.555
I've said let's rob a bank before.

569
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:03.570
but everyone looks at me like that.

570
00:32:04.634 --> 00:32:06.084
Yeah. we're not doing that.

571
00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:09.523
I will figure everything out. Now. come on.

572
00:32:09.972 --> 00:32:12.398
Let's go. We're going
inside. Let's get creative.

573
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.547
We have a full day ahead of us.

574
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.742
First we have art therapy.
and then we have group talk.

575
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.515
And then we have therapy
therapy. Come on. Maude.

576
00:32:20.675 --> 00:32:23.086
No. I'm just gonna be
here for a few minutes.

577
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.993
Tell Sophie I'll be in soon.

578
00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:27.078
I'll stay with you.

579
00:32:27.133 --> 00:32:29.031
No. I wanna be alone. I'm fine.

580
00:32:29.234 --> 00:32:30.359
You know the rules. Maude.

581
00:32:30.422 --> 00:32:32.153
I can't leave you alone right now.

582
00:32:32.255 --> 00:32:33.258
Okay. fine.

583
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.350
I'll wander. okay.

584
00:32:34.392 --> 00:32:36.017
You let me know when you're ready to go.

585
00:32:36.062 --> 00:32:37.069
Okay.

586
00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.213
Who's that?

587
00:32:57.303 --> 00:32:58.720
My son.

588
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.323
Is he waving hello or goodbye?

589
00:33:27.457 --> 00:33:28.873
Who is this?

590
00:33:28.983 --> 00:33:30.027
Her son.

591
00:33:30.648 --> 00:33:31.878
Tell me about him.

592
00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.838
His name is Derek. and he's 27.

593
00:33:35.897 --> 00:33:37.815
But he'll always be my baby boy.

594
00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:41.343
Why is he waving?

595
00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:44.417
I'll never forget the first time

596
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.786
Harold and I took a trip without him.

597
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:48.372
He was with his grandparents.

598
00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:51.317
And this is him waving to
us as we left for the airport.

599
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.213
I was all smiles.

600
00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:57.363
But I was crying inside.

601
00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.794
Where is he now?

602
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.170
On a mission.

603
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.890
Is he a spy?

604
00:34:07.984 --> 00:34:09.005
He's a Marine.

605
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.280
He was deployed two years ago.

606
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.433
And he's still there?

607
00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.320
Maybe we can talk about him later?

608
00:34:24.027 --> 00:34:25.841
What do we have here?

609
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.809
The 'emptiness of life'.

610
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.670
Oh. and the 'human condition'.

611
00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:32.286
Here you can see my purple scrubs.

612
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.387
And you can see my name
tag. It says Nurse Amber.

613
00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:37.747
You see? You see it. right? Yeah.

614
00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.122
And then I have three
of these little tear drops.

615
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.262
because this guy didn't make it.

616
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:44.044
In jail they say that every

617
00:34:44.086 --> 00:34:46.340
tear drop you have is somebody...

618
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:48.827
You know what I'm saying?

619
00:34:48.965 --> 00:34:51.370
Okay. We'll talk.

620
00:35:39.145 --> 00:35:40.432
Hey. Blue.

621
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.543
Have you met Alice? She's brand new here.

622
00:35:43.877 --> 00:35:46.337
Oh yeah. the other day. I'm security.

623
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.801
Yeah. Blue keeps us safe.
'cause he is the toughest

624
00:35:48.894 --> 00:35:50.970
mean machine man out here. right Blue?

625
00:35:51.071 --> 00:35:52.136
Hells yeah.

626
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.465
I'm gonna go on my rounds.

627
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.683
Okay. thank you.

628
00:35:58.941 --> 00:36:00.558
His real name is Sam.

629
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.963
He used to be an all pro
tackle for the Springfield Colts.

630
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.121
Wears that blue jersey everywhere.

631
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.680
Name Blue just kind of stuck.

632
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.368
He took a pretty serious blow to the head.

633
00:36:12.454 --> 00:36:14.430
It left him a little

634
00:36:14.751 --> 00:36:16.037
Blue actually lives here.

635
00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:17.643
Sophie's his full time caregiver.

636
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.790
Sophie wants to know

637
00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:22.063
if you are going to attend
the fourth night party.

638
00:36:22.467 --> 00:36:24.117
I can move some of my meetings around.

639
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.630
Yeah. I can probably make it.

640
00:36:26.757 --> 00:36:27.952
What's that about?

641
00:36:27.999 --> 00:36:30.147
It's a sweet way to send us off.

642
00:36:30.469 --> 00:36:31.725
It's our last night together.

643
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:33.570
before we'll have to leave the house.

644
00:36:33.646 --> 00:36:35.241
House rul...

645
00:36:35.312 --> 00:36:36.812
Isn't this a pretty picture?

646
00:36:39.678 --> 00:36:40.865
Is that new blood I see?

647
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.104
Leave us alone. We're calling the police.

648
00:36:43.206 --> 00:36:44.253
Here I am.

649
00:36:44.323 --> 00:36:46.643
trying to welcome this little
bitch into the neighborhood.

650
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:48.417
You're acting like you don't know me?

651
00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.151
That's cold blooded Grand-Maud.
Screw o...

652
00:36:51.214 --> 00:36:53.667
You're gonna talk back
like that to your employer?

653
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.979
I don't work for you anymore.

654
00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.276
You're wrong. little girl.

655
00:36:57.362 --> 00:36:58.932
You still haven't paid off your debt.

656
00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:03.259
Why don't you two butt heads

657
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.830
get the hell outta here and
leave these fine people alone?

658
00:37:06.017 --> 00:37:07.225
Why don't you come on up?

659
00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:08.931
I have a little something here for you.

660
00:37:08.978 --> 00:37:10.853
Hey! Teddy!

661
00:37:10.908 --> 00:37:12.491
Don't you call me that. you old hag.

662
00:37:12.533 --> 00:37:13.830
You know that's not my name.

663
00:37:13.916 --> 00:37:18.830
You're right. it isn't. It's
Theodore. Theodore Bullock.

664
00:37:20.752 --> 00:37:22.802
T-bullshit is more like it.

665
00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:27.529
Why don't you boys leave? Go home.

666
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.240
Your mothers are probably worried sick.

667
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.927
I'm looking at my Mamacita right now.

668
00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.750
I'm here for Amber.

669
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.693
Are they here for you. Amber?

670
00:37:36.779 --> 00:37:38.724
I don't know what they're doing here.

671
00:37:38.892 --> 00:37:41.959
Oh. come on. That just
simply hurts my feelings.

672
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.170
You're not the emotional type.

673
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.563
Just leave. There's nothing here for you.

674
00:37:47.413 --> 00:37:49.033
Amber. go inside.

675
00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:52.503
I'm not afraid... Amber. get inside now.

676
00:37:54.648 --> 00:37:56.178
Yeah. you'll listen to that old hag.

677
00:37:56.248 --> 00:37:57.597
She'll keep you safe.

678
00:37:57.643 --> 00:38:00.104
along with Mr. Big Security Man over here.

679
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.854
Get on your way. now!

680
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.450
You can't keep her forever.

681
00:38:06.822 --> 00:38:08.267
We'll come back for you.

682
00:38:08.345 --> 00:38:10.854
And you're a little older than we take.

683
00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.903
but come and find me.

684
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:15.869
We'll find something for you to do.

685
00:38:18.431 --> 00:38:20.500
Let's go. dirt bags. Let's go.

686
00:38:25.619 --> 00:38:26.784
Don't let the door hit you

687
00:38:26.846 --> 00:38:29.079
where the good Lord splits you. bitches.

688
00:38:29.149 --> 00:38:30.319
What's their deal?

689
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:31.971
They belong to a gang.

690
00:38:32.081 --> 00:38:33.731
They called themselves the Five X's.

691
00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.612
I noticed the X burns
on parts of their bodies.

692
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:38.737
Every time one of them does something

693
00:38:38.792 --> 00:38:41.823
they consider remarkable.
they get branded with an X.

694
00:38:41.893 --> 00:38:43.578
You don't become a full member of the gang

695
00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.883
until you have five X's.

696
00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:47.471
What do they want with Amber?

697
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.348
Oh. they go way back with Amber.

698
00:38:50.537 --> 00:38:53.207
They recruited her in high school.

699
00:38:53.277 --> 00:38:54.895
Yo and her were sweethearts.

700
00:38:54.957 --> 00:38:56.181
They used to keep her high.

701
00:38:56.223 --> 00:38:57.653
and forced her to work the streets.

702
00:38:57.699 --> 00:38:59.349
Pieces of crap even filmed her.

703
00:39:17.382 --> 00:39:18.727
Hey. Georgina. - Hey.

704
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.966
How are things going? - Good. good.

705
00:39:24.321 --> 00:39:27.799
Oh. Georgina. you better be
bringing me some good news.

706
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.610
Well. I have done all the paperwork.

707
00:39:29.684 --> 00:39:31.684
So I hope. you know. we
can make something work.

708
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.913
I have the assess...

709
00:39:33.403 --> 00:39:36.864
Hm. can we go inside
where is a bit more private?

710
00:39:36.922 --> 00:39:38.012
Yes. of course.

711
00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:40.220
Please step into my
office. I'll see you a little bit.

712
00:39:40.262 --> 00:39:42.778
Bobby. can you please tell
Andrew to bring us some tea?

713
00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.841
And when you see Steph.
tell her to start with Alice.

714
00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:48.420
Okay. - Thank you. hun.

715
00:39:55.153 --> 00:39:56.192
How bad is it?

716
00:39:56.286 --> 00:39:59.614
It's very bad. Missed more
than a couple payments.

717
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.669
How much is owed?

718
00:40:01.779 --> 00:40:02.794
20.000.

719
00:40:05.463 --> 00:40:07.233
We applied for a grant.

720
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.333
We should hear back any day now.

721
00:40:09.381 --> 00:40:11.731
That'll bring us up to
date and keep us afloat.

722
00:40:12.958 --> 00:40:14.458
In the meantime. we'll continue

723
00:40:14.505 --> 00:40:16.310
to reach out to our regular benefactors.

724
00:40:18.152 --> 00:40:21.325
Hey. where's Amber? I
brought her GED application.

725
00:40:22.024 --> 00:40:23.508
She just needs a few minutes alone.

726
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:24.731
She'll join us shortly.

727
00:40:28.248 --> 00:40:30.059
What are you studying?

728
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.309
I'm finishing my Gen Ed.

729
00:40:32.522 --> 00:40:33.989
Thinking about getting into pre-law.

730
00:40:34.051 --> 00:40:36.120
'cause it's the best
way to help around here.

731
00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:38.640
Maybe business.

732
00:40:38.731 --> 00:40:43.640
That sounds boooring.
Bobby. I see you as an artist.

733
00:40:44.156 --> 00:40:46.076
What we need is to be more money savvy.

734
00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:47.820
not have another painting on the wall.

735
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:50.605
Those are good degrees.
Derek. They'll get your work.

736
00:40:50.813 --> 00:40:52.613
You know you just called me Derek.

737
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.191
I did?

738
00:40:54.238 --> 00:40:55.301
I'm sorry.

739
00:40:55.363 --> 00:40:58.246
It's okay. Do you want to talk about him?

740
00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:00.160
He was my son.

741
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.402
He studied philosophy.

742
00:41:02.883 --> 00:41:04.413
He ended up in the military.

743
00:41:04.523 --> 00:41:06.223
Is he no longer with us?

744
00:41:07.061 --> 00:41:08.861
What do you mean? Why would you say that?

745
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.105
I'm sorry for assuming.

746
00:41:10.183 --> 00:41:12.350
It's just that you said
was. in the past tense.

747
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.373
Well. you're wrong. He's not.

748
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.093
Ladies and gentleman!

749
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.691
Steph is here.

750
00:41:21.733 --> 00:41:23.030
Thanks. Andrew.

751
00:41:23.122 --> 00:41:24.273
Thanks.

752
00:41:27.465 --> 00:41:29.535
Steph is our therapist.

753
00:41:29.637 --> 00:41:31.677
Sophie wanted you to
be the first to see her.

754
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:32.788
Do I have to?

755
00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:34.843
It's a Sophie rule.

756
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.507
I have no say?

757
00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.608
You don't have to say anything.

758
00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:40.608
What if I don't feel like it?

759
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:41.763
Nobody does.

760
00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.463
But we all do.

761
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.522
We all do.

762
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.686
We all do.

763
00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:12.938
We have a mandatory 45 minutes.

764
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:19.436
We could talk.

765
00:42:20.809 --> 00:42:22.189
or continue to stare at each other

766
00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.647
and let the clock run out.

767
00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.880
What am I supposed to say?

768
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.893
Anything you want.

769
00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:42.393
What's the point of
talking about anything?

770
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:46.233
Well. it's something.
if it's important to you.

771
00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:48.783
Talking helps.

772
00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:53.343
Be it with a stranger.
a pet. even a puppet.

773
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:57.273
It doesn't help me understand you better.

774
00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.144
It helps you understand yourself.

775
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:05.160
I know exactly how
I'm feeling all the time.

776
00:43:06.112 --> 00:43:07.642
And what is that?

777
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:11.313
Scared. anxious. apprehensive.

778
00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:13.383
About what?

779
00:43:14.539 --> 00:43:17.226
Those emotions
are triggered by fear.

780
00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.803
What scares you? Is it
being here in the shelter?

781
00:43:21.651 --> 00:43:23.004
Are you afraid of someone?

782
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.073
Of a loss that you won't accept?

783
00:43:27.619 --> 00:43:28.879
Whom have you lost?

784
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:31.713
I saw a grief counselor.
but it was pointless.

785
00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.843
Because my son is still alive.

786
00:43:51.832 --> 00:43:53.328
How did therapy go?

787
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.781
Bobby tells me you got upset at him

788
00:44:00.101 --> 00:44:02.253
over a comment he made about your son.

789
00:44:06.778 --> 00:44:08.758
I know you're not a drunk.

790
00:44:08.899 --> 00:44:11.299
And I know you haven't
been on the streets long.

791
00:44:12.406 --> 00:44:14.013
Your teeth are very white.

792
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.183
What are you hiding from?

793
00:44:22.055 --> 00:44:24.125
What are you so afraid of that you'd rather

794
00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.730
take your chances out
on the street than facing it?

795
00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:29.110
I just need...

796
00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:31.961
to be away.

797
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.933
from everything.

798
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.043
from everyone I know.

799
00:44:43.732 --> 00:44:45.622
You want a clean slate.

800
00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:49.799
What? I mean a vacay to
reorganize your thoughts.

801
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.893
One hell of a way you chose to do it.

802
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.073
Going on a cruise is more my thing.

803
00:45:00.545 --> 00:45:04.388
But. you are here now.
And I'm responsible for you.

804
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:09.451
Are you coming back after the reset?

805
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.613
Where else would I go?

806
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:21.123
The truth? Not here. and not out there.

807
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:24.601
I mean our society is broken.

808
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.101
We're overworked. overstressed.

809
00:45:27.177 --> 00:45:29.247
living paycheck to paycheck.

810
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:32.133
with little savings. and hugely in debt.

811
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.764
We're over medicated. fatigued.

812
00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.288
dying of heart disease and cancer.

813
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.624
We've confused keeping
up with the Jones' with living.

814
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.370
and are dying with regret

815
00:45:44.456 --> 00:45:46.409
of all the things we wish we had done.

816
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.793
Why would anyone want to go back to that?

817
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:59.403
The truth. the truth is in here.

818
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.173
You have to be brave
to face what's in here.

819
00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:10.477
Find yourself. find your
balance in this world of ours.

820
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.680
and live the best life you can.

821
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.693
This here is limbo.

822
00:46:17.107 --> 00:46:19.060
Don't get comfortable.

823
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:28.282
Or you'll get trapped. like
many of these other lost souls.

824
00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:34.188
At the end of every reset.

825
00:46:35.104 --> 00:46:37.777
I hope I never see anyone come back.

826
00:46:39.378 --> 00:46:41.313
And I continue to be disappointed.

827
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:46.983
I've had too many losses.

828
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.001
I need a win.

829
00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.568
♫ Running through life
searching for what's right

830
00:47:08.765 --> 00:47:10.958
There you are. We've
been looking all over for you.

831
00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:12.713
Are you ready for a big adventure?

832
00:47:14.551 --> 00:47:17.691
♫ It may just be you and I

833
00:47:18.199 --> 00:47:21.646
♫ The way I see the light within your eyes

834
00:47:21.954 --> 00:47:25.215
♫ And sound is turned off inside my mind

835
00:47:25.451 --> 00:47:28.255
Amber. Bobby brought the GED application.

836
00:47:28.304 --> 00:47:30.199
You wanna fill it out
tomorrow before you leave?

837
00:47:30.241 --> 00:47:31.259
Yeah!

838
00:47:31.301 --> 00:47:34.060
I hear it's somebody's special day.

839
00:47:35.234 --> 00:47:36.891
Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue.

840
00:47:37.274 --> 00:47:38.849
Is it Blue's birthday?

841
00:47:40.033 --> 00:47:42.583
No. this is the cake we
started as a last night tradition.

842
00:47:42.715 --> 00:47:44.424
We take turns with the names.

843
00:48:23.687 --> 00:48:27.463
♫ The clock is ticking down
and we're living it up right now

844
00:48:39.068 --> 00:48:41.686
I am the Amazing Andrew.

845
00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:30.020
Look after the place. Blue.

846
00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.569
Bye. guys.

847
00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:38.569
Be safe.

848
00:49:43.337 --> 00:49:44.587
She's coming.

849
00:49:51.747 --> 00:49:53.827
Hey. guys. Where Amber?

850
00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:55.835
She's in the garden waiting for you.

851
00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.840
We'll get her later.
when we go to the store.

852
00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.950
Okay. I'll remind her. Stay of trouble.

853
00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:09.993
There you are.

854
00:50:11.495 --> 00:50:13.358
You had me worried for a bit.

855
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:15.169
I'm sorry.

856
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.513
I just didn't want the
others to see me off.

857
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.678
Why?

858
00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.632
I was afraid that if I left with them.

859
00:50:23.674 --> 00:50:25.842
I don't know if I would've come back.

860
00:50:26.228 --> 00:50:28.875
I wanna try this nurse thing. Ms Sophie.

861
00:50:29.907 --> 00:50:31.643
I look good in purple.

862
00:50:31.705 --> 00:50:34.022
Well. they'll be picking you
up on the way to the store.

863
00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:36.633
Hey. Soph'. The freaking
bank's on the phone.

864
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:39.933
I'm on my way.

865
00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.693
Hey. Amber. I got your GED application.

866
00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:48.439
Are you gonna help me fill it out?

867
00:50:48.542 --> 00:50:49.622
You bet.

868
00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.210
Come on up. Let's work on it.

869
00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.283
Sure.

870
00:50:56.182 --> 00:50:57.189
It's just two pages.

871
00:50:57.268 --> 00:50:58.924
So we can get this done really quick.

872
00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.510
Okay. yeah. Easy.

873
00:51:00.564 --> 00:51:02.041
She hasn't come out yet.

874
00:51:04.942 --> 00:51:07.242
Let's get outta here.
We'll come back later.

875
00:51:32.051 --> 00:51:34.978
Hey. Andy. Where you
going? The park's this way.

876
00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:37.068
Y'all go on ahead. I'll
catch up with you. okay?

877
00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:39.410
Don't you worry. I won't
miss my curtain call.

878
00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.775
You just go out. and already
thinking about the bottle?

879
00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:44.583
Don't judge me. Egg Man.

880
00:51:45.929 --> 00:51:47.552
He'll be back. Let's just go.

881
00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.968
We're going to the park first.

882
00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:52.025
to see Huevo's brother. Bubba.

883
00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.321
And then later on tonight.

884
00:51:53.363 --> 00:51:55.150
we're going to crash at his store.

885
00:51:55.596 --> 00:51:56.713
It's a convenience store.

886
00:51:56.799 --> 00:51:58.263
He let's us stay on the roof.

887
00:51:59.959 --> 00:52:02.041
I sleep in the car. I don't do heights.

888
00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:04.510
Hey. I have a joke.

889
00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:07.974
What came first. the chicken or the huevo?

890
00:52:11.037 --> 00:52:12.185
It's funny.

891
00:52:17.706 --> 00:52:19.045
Bubba!

892
00:52:19.316 --> 00:52:20.326
Hermano.

893
00:52:26.693 --> 00:52:27.829
Hey. Jen.

894
00:52:27.899 --> 00:52:29.326
Hi. Maude. Hi. Huevo.

895
00:52:29.408 --> 00:52:30.987
Hey. Jen.

896
00:52:31.029 --> 00:52:32.810
Will the roof be available tonight?

897
00:52:32.857 --> 00:52:34.995
Of course. Just head
on up whenever you want.

898
00:52:35.037 --> 00:52:36.052
I'm here until three.

899
00:52:36.099 --> 00:52:39.013
You're an angel. Bubba. This is Alice.

900
00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:42.101
I can make some dogs and
fresh juice if you all want some.

901
00:52:42.218 --> 00:52:43.748
You're a real peach.

902
00:52:47.873 --> 00:52:49.279
I'll be back shortly. Bubba.

903
00:52:49.334 --> 00:52:51.638
I wanna do some restock
for a bit. earn a bit of money.

904
00:52:51.708 --> 00:52:54.091
Espera. I got something for you.

905
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:03.006
Buy. Huevo.

906
00:53:03.067 --> 00:53:04.065
Bye.

907
00:53:04.107 --> 00:53:06.420
Anyone have
a small white balloon that

908
00:53:06.498 --> 00:53:08.724
I can use? You. young lady

909
00:53:08.787 --> 00:53:10.608
with the fuzzy head. Come here.

910
00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:14.823
For my first trick. I'm gonna
turn this balloon into an...

911
00:53:16.177 --> 00:53:17.177
An egg!

912
00:53:17.904 --> 00:53:20.584
Oh! That was good. right?

913
00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:23.560
Thank you. young lady.
For you. some flowers.

914
00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:25.498
Thank you very much.

915
00:53:25.597 --> 00:53:27.100
Off you go. There you go.

916
00:53:27.275 --> 00:53:28.865
Now. for my next trick.

917
00:53:28.974 --> 00:53:31.966
The children are
really enjoying his tricks.

918
00:53:32.036 --> 00:53:33.279
You're allowed to clap.

919
00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:35.904
He's actually quite
incredible with an audience.

920
00:53:35.955 --> 00:53:38.240
You'd never know it. but he
used to have a show in Vegas.

921
00:53:38.294 --> 00:53:39.636
That’s big. what happened?

922
00:53:39.678 --> 00:53:40.787
Ready on the count of 3

923
00:53:40.904 --> 00:53:42.439
His wife was his assistant

924
00:53:42.482 --> 00:53:43.927
and something happened between them.

925
00:53:43.998 --> 00:53:45.318
1.2.3. blow.

926
00:53:45.412 --> 00:53:47.961
After that. he was
drinking and missing performances.

927
00:53:48.039 --> 00:53:50.500
Very good. A
little wet. but that's okay!

928
00:53:50.858 --> 00:53:52.450
He ended up bottoming out here.

929
00:53:52.492 --> 00:53:54.192
in this very park one night four years ago.

930
00:53:55.281 --> 00:53:57.231
If he can find a
way to beat the alcohol.

931
00:53:57.273 --> 00:53:58.754
maybe he can start over again.

932
00:54:00.265 --> 00:54:02.265
Well. not unless he can get an agent

933
00:54:02.449 --> 00:54:05.008
that will get him a new
liver as part of his contract.

934
00:54:05.171 --> 00:54:06.796
Is it that bad?

935
00:54:07.281 --> 00:54:09.530
He only drinks at Sophie's. he doesn't

936
00:54:09.586 --> 00:54:10.676
even eat any food anymore.

937
00:54:10.718 --> 00:54:12.317
I am going to need a volunteer.

938
00:54:12.359 --> 00:54:13.380
Oh. that's my cue.

939
00:54:13.422 --> 00:54:16.984
Yes. young lady with
the... new one. yes aaah.

940
00:54:17.054 --> 00:54:19.468
here we go. Another volunteer.

941
00:54:19.675 --> 00:54:20.875
Thank you very much.

942
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:21.961
What's your name?

943
00:54:22.023 --> 00:54:23.047
Maude.

944
00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:25.476
Maude. and we've never met before. have we?

945
00:54:25.596 --> 00:54:26.656
Okay. let's sta...

946
00:54:27.256 --> 00:54:28.320
What is that? What?

947
00:54:29.087 --> 00:54:30.257
Oh my God! - What?

948
00:54:30.335 --> 00:54:31.595
Oh my God! - What?

949
00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:32.670
Did you see that?

950
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:33.960
You ready for this?

951
00:54:34.023 --> 00:54:38.140
Now we're gonna put this
egg in your forehead. Tada!

952
00:54:39.999 --> 00:54:41.172
Alice.

953
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:43.353
Gracias. This looks wonderful.

954
00:54:43.797 --> 00:54:44.797
Try it.

955
00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:47.422
Did you make this?

956
00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:48.533
Yeah.

957
00:54:48.625 --> 00:54:49.812
Yum.

958
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:52.923
Has Huevo gotten help for his PTSD?

959
00:54:53.867 --> 00:54:55.336
He had an episode the other night.

960
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.039
Si. Military shrink gave him some pills.

961
00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.164
and told him to shake it off.

962
00:55:01.274 --> 00:55:03.554
At home. he never wants
to talk about what happened.

963
00:55:04.571 --> 00:55:06.811
We were okay with that because he said he.

964
00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.820
he did some horrible things out there.

965
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.083
Latinos don't easily accept mental illness.

966
00:55:13.984 --> 00:55:15.383
And that's why most of the family

967
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:16.773
stays away. scared of him.

968
00:55:18.025 --> 00:55:20.425
So we help Senorita
Sophie with whatever we can.

969
00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:22.970
No other shelter will take him.

970
00:55:24.537 --> 00:55:26.097
He seems so harmless.

971
00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:29.153
He's a sweet man. but he
can't hold down a steady job.

972
00:55:29.886 --> 00:55:32.216
He kind of loses it sometimes.

973
00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.163
It ranges from verbal
abuse to physical violence.

974
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:39.359
He spent many nights in a cell.

975
00:55:41.164 --> 00:55:42.208
Huevo.

976
00:55:43.423 --> 00:55:44.973
Did I miss the show?

977
00:55:46.675 --> 00:55:48.765
It's gonna be
amazing. Are you ready?

978
00:55:48.852 --> 00:55:51.215
Abby. I think you're gonna
like this one. You ready?

979
00:55:51.297 --> 00:55:52.297
Haa!

980
00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:55.742
A tie dyed wind sock. Thank you very much.

981
00:55:56.336 --> 00:55:58.818
Thank you. Thank you. thank you. Okay.

982
00:56:01.685 --> 00:56:03.405
This is what we're gonna do. Are you ready?

983
00:56:03.521 --> 00:56:06.251
Close your eyes. I'm gonna disappear.

984
00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.253
And open your eyes.

985
00:56:12.182 --> 00:56:13.413
Where'd he go?

986
00:56:13.519 --> 00:56:14.600
Where did he go?

987
00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:15.742
And I'm back.

988
00:56:16.375 --> 00:56:17.984
Wow!

989
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.953
Did you see that. Abby?

990
00:56:21.724 --> 00:56:23.704
Thank you. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

991
00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:26.945
If you have it in your
heart to spare a few dollars

992
00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:29.660
or coins or something. I
would really appreciate it.

993
00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:32.490
Thank you very much.
guys. Thank you very much.

994
00:56:34.188 --> 00:56:35.853
Enjoy the rest of your day.

995
00:56:36.618 --> 00:56:38.787
We're getting
together this weekend at Mom's.

996
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:40.563
You're welcome to come too. Alice.

997
00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.516
Huevo's friends are my friends.

998
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.485
Is your mom a good cook?

999
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:46.673
She makes the best gorditas in the world.

1000
00:56:47.001 --> 00:56:48.696
You like chili rellenos?

1001
00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.149
You are very good.

1002
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:53.516
Maybe you could do private events.

1003
00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:54.743
Thank you. my dear.

1004
00:56:54.821 --> 00:56:57.165
But sadly. I'm an even more Amazing Drunk.

1005
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:59.973
I can't get a decent booking anywhere.

1006
00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.605
You goof.

1007
00:57:03.418 --> 00:57:04.805
The only booking you're gonna get

1008
00:57:04.847 --> 00:57:06.574
is for ripping off liquor stores.

1009
00:57:06.636 --> 00:57:09.483
Amazing Andrew uses
his hands for shoplifting.

1010
00:57:10.303 --> 00:57:12.913
Anyways. Did you see what he did?

1011
00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.110
It looked like he actually
put an egg through my head.

1012
00:57:16.204 --> 00:57:18.305
What does Andy do with
the eggs after the show?

1013
00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:20.985
I have taken a magician's oath.

1014
00:57:21.266 --> 00:57:25.251
I assure you no eggs have
been harmed during the prestige.

1015
00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.993
Actually it's silicone and
it's in his back pocket.

1016
00:57:28.898 --> 00:57:30.125
You see?

1017
00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.516
It's not bad. guys.

1018
00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:37.829
I got enough for a nice
Cabernet here. Any takers?

1019
00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.590
All right. listen.

1020
00:57:41.667 --> 00:57:44.969
I'm gonna go get myself
a couple two buck chucks.

1021
00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:47.329
You guys go get whatever you want.

1022
00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:48.927
and I'll meet you back at the roof.

1023
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:50.688
Why don't you just join us for lunch?

1024
00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:52.475
I mean. there's plenty here for everyone.

1025
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:55.469
And there'll still be
enough for wine afterwards.

1026
00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.535
I made enough for pizza.

1027
00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:00.210
And ruin a beautiful
bottle of wine with food?

1028
00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:02.673
Why are you doing this to yourself?

1029
00:58:04.082 --> 00:58:06.944
Madam. please don't dare judge me

1030
00:58:07.085 --> 00:58:09.813
until you have walked
a mile in my wingtips.

1031
00:58:10.897 --> 00:58:11.960
You know what?

1032
00:58:12.033 --> 00:58:13.090
You are so hell bent

1033
00:58:13.158 --> 00:58:15.310
on ending your life as soon as possible.

1034
00:58:15.443 --> 00:58:17.021
Are you all right?

1035
00:58:17.208 --> 00:58:19.338
Look at the two of us. huh sweetheart?

1036
00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:22.920
We both suck them back to dull the pain.

1037
00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:25.474
We both drink to forget.

1038
00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:27.349
I tell you what. my good friend.

1039
00:58:27.431 --> 00:58:28.871
Why don't you wait up for me?

1040
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:31.271
And we can be terminal together too!

1041
00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:35.404
Oh. you're Amazing all
right. You're an amazing A-hole.

1042
00:58:35.719 --> 00:58:36.739
What is that about?

1043
00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:38.160
Last year Maude found out

1044
00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:40.443
she got a inoperable tumor in her stomach.

1045
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:43.210
The pain must be terrible.

1046
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:46.743
Sophie gives her medicines. but out here.

1047
00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:49.773
Maude. I'm so sorry.

1048
00:58:50.904 --> 00:58:53.341
You know what? Just ignore
what that piece of shit said.

1049
00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:55.896
I don't need you people
feeling sorry for me.

1050
00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:57.920
Hell. if I wanted that. I'd call my kids.

1051
00:58:57.995 --> 00:58:59.363
Is there something I can do?

1052
00:58:59.405 --> 00:59:00.691
Yeah. you know what you can do?

1053
00:59:00.733 --> 00:59:01.870
You can do something for me.

1054
00:59:01.912 --> 00:59:03.739
You can put some food in Andy's body.

1055
00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:06.379
so he doesn't starve himself to death.

1056
00:59:26.975 --> 00:59:27.975
Humm!

1057
00:59:52.863 --> 00:59:55.635
♪ Don't act like you love me ♪

1058
00:59:56.915 --> 00:59:59.643
♪ Don't act like you care ♪

1059
01:00:00.156 --> 01:00:01.939
Do you have any family?

1060
01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:03.360
Three kids.

1061
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.706
My husband is deceased.

1062
01:00:05.971 --> 01:00:07.104
Do they know?

1063
01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.220
Of course they know.

1064
01:00:08.292 --> 01:00:10.600
You have family. What
are you doing out here?

1065
01:00:10.717 --> 01:00:13.084
Cause I don't want
to be a burden to them.

1066
01:00:13.216 --> 01:00:14.521
Didn't they care?

1067
01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:17.170
Of course they
care. from a distance.

1068
01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.537
They all want to look after me.

1069
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:21.779
as long as I'm not with them.

1070
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:25.201
Johnny's offered me
a live-in nurse at his expense.

1071
01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:29.584
Julie said she'll pay my hospital
bills when the time comes.

1072
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.033
And Nora. she said
she'll fly out for a few weeks.

1073
01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:35.326
What do you want?

1074
01:00:36.605 --> 01:00:39.548
No one's ever asked me that.

1075
01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:41.614
You know what I don't want?

1076
01:00:41.825 --> 01:00:44.939
I don't wanna be in a nursing
home. or even a hospital

1077
01:00:44.981 --> 01:00:47.598
with tubes stuck in me just waiting to die.

1078
01:00:47.855 --> 01:00:50.278
I wanna be with people I enjoy.

1079
01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:52.910
people who are alone. but not lonely.

1080
01:00:52.996 --> 01:00:55.878
At Cottonwood.
I'm a part of something there.

1081
01:00:55.964 --> 01:00:58.309
I'm doing something. I'm not just dying.

1082
01:00:58.434 --> 01:00:59.996
I'm part of a cause.

1083
01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.170
I know it's not much.

1084
01:01:01.239 --> 01:01:04.963
My social security check
helps with the groceries.

1085
01:01:05.277 --> 01:01:07.437
And Sophie. she's helped me find a program

1086
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.009
that gets my medicine at a lower cost.

1087
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:11.830
You contribute to the shelter?

1088
01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:15.750
Then you don't need to be out here.

1089
01:01:15.845 --> 01:01:19.689
No. actually I do.
It all adds up. medicine. rent.

1090
01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:22.580
Some of us have jobs. and
we can't even make ends meet.

1091
01:01:23.721 --> 01:01:26.456
What about you?
What's your story about?

1092
01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:29.971
I wanna be alone. but not lonely.

1093
01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.471
You have a boy. Does
he play a part in this?

1094
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:36.714
My son went missing in action for months.

1095
01:01:36.895 --> 01:01:39.143
And then we got a notice that he was dead.

1096
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.750
That can't be. because

1097
01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.943
I don't feel it. you know?

1098
01:01:45.867 --> 01:01:49.120
And a mother would
know if her son was gone.

1099
01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:50.443
But the letter.

1100
01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:53.103
Letters can be
wrong. sent by accident.

1101
01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:55.083
It can't be true.

1102
01:01:56.461 --> 01:01:57.593
Married?

1103
01:01:57.711 --> 01:01:59.664
Business trip. He's accepted it.

1104
01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:02.320
He thinks I'm crazy for wanting to hold on.

1105
01:02:02.477 --> 01:02:04.078
You're not.

1106
01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:06.963
Sometimes you gotta lie
to yourself to keep going.

1107
01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:14.493
Be warned. The truth is going
to come out. Prepare yourself.

1108
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:19.554
Greet it with a smile. and not with fear.

1109
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:24.323

1110
01:02:25.806 --> 01:02:28.533

Hey. Andy. We gotta get Amber.

1116
01:03:00.066 --> 01:03:01.703
Get up. you bum!

1117
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.973
There's no bum here.

1118
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:10.039
Just people who haven't
found the right way in life yet.

1119
01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:12.761
We gotta get going.

1120
01:03:19.267 --> 01:03:20.656
Come on!

1121
01:03:54.787 --> 01:03:56.252
Hey. guys.

1122
01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:58.536
We're all ready here.

1123
01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:00.903
Gonna head to the store.
get it all ready for tonight.

1124
01:04:01.202 --> 01:04:02.555
See you there?

1125
01:04:03.145 --> 01:04:04.419
Bye. Huevo.

1126
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.395
We're moving in.

1127
01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:17.600
What about the big guy?

1128
01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:21.333
I brought an old friend for him.

1129
01:04:24.776 --> 01:04:26.283
Okay.

1130
01:04:42.825 --> 01:04:46.088
Exactly - Oh yeah. I
think that looks right.

1131
01:04:46.204 --> 01:04:47.817
And that's your autograph.

1132
01:04:47.974 --> 01:04:49.091
Oh. yes! - Yes.

1133
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:51.523
So I'm signing right
here. blah blah blah.

1134
01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.062
yeah... okay.

1135
01:04:53.297 --> 01:04:54.625
Don't forget this.

1136
01:04:54.717 --> 01:04:57.054
Have you been accepted
to the US Military before?

1137
01:04:57.343 --> 01:04:58.367
No.

1138
01:04:58.495 --> 01:04:59.717
Are you sure?

1139
01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:01.567
I might have to double check.

1140
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:02.672
Okay.

1141
01:05:05.188 --> 01:05:07.390
- Hm. no I don't see...
- Say No to that.

1142
01:05:07.432 --> 01:05:08.843
Oh Yeah! Maybe one here.

1143
01:05:08.917 --> 01:05:10.437
And one more autograph there.

1144
01:05:10.492 --> 01:05:11.815
Okay nice.

1145
01:05:45.981 --> 01:05:47.468
You can't be here.

1146
01:05:47.679 --> 01:05:49.984
Hey. big man. I'm here for Amber.

1147
01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:51.733
No visitors allowed.

1148
01:05:51.797 --> 01:05:53.804
I'm not visiting.
just picking her up.

1149
01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:55.164
You can't be here.

1150
01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:56.400
Says who?

1151
01:05:56.468 --> 01:05:58.468
Ms Sophie. you dumb ass.

1152
01:05:58.654 --> 01:05:59.764
I don't see her.

1153
01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:01.898
So I guess it doesn't
matter what she thinks.

1154
01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:03.773
You're gonna get in b... big trouble.

1155
01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.390
Is that right?

1156
01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:07.325
You're a little slow
there aren't you. biggie?

1157
01:06:07.367 --> 01:06:09.140
I'm security.

1158
01:06:10.812 --> 01:06:12.200
That was sick.

1159
01:06:14.117 --> 01:06:16.008
Let me get this on Snap.

1160
01:06:32.853 --> 01:06:34.293
That's it?

1161
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:36.086
There you go!

1162
01:06:36.179 --> 01:06:38.025
Oh my gosh. thank you so much Bobby.

1163
01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:40.117
I couldn’t have done it with you.

1164
01:06:40.414 --> 01:06:43.030
All signed. sealed and ready to deliver.

1165
01:06:43.297 --> 01:06:45.430
Umm hmm. oh and just in time too

1166
01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.422
the group should
be here to pick me up.

1167
01:06:47.492 --> 01:06:48.612
Yeah.

1168
01:06:49.414 --> 01:06:51.506
Hey. well
what are friends for right

1169
01:06:51.548 --> 01:06:52.571
Yeah.

1170
01:06:52.617 --> 01:06:54.762
let's send it off
first thing in the morning.

1171
01:06:54.804 --> 01:06:55.954
Okay.

1172
01:06:56.563 --> 01:06:57.664
She's mine!

1173
01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:04.352
Oh!

1174
01:07:04.664 --> 01:07:05.704
Shhh.

1175
01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:08.179
I told you I'd be back for you.

1176
01:07:08.523 --> 01:07:09.881
Stay put. - BLUE!

1177
01:07:09.937 --> 01:07:11.590
Not so tough without the big guy huh!

1178
01:07:11.632 --> 01:07:12.694
What did you do to him?

1179
01:07:12.749 --> 01:07:15.031
Same thing we'll do
to you if you get in our way.

1180
01:07:15.089 --> 01:07:16.523
Bobby! What did you do to my son?

1181
01:07:16.583 --> 01:07:18.586
You can tend to him
as soon as we get Amber.

1182
01:07:18.633 --> 01:07:20.014
I'm not going anywhere with you!

1183
01:07:20.056 --> 01:07:21.817
I'm not leaving without
my number one earner.

1184
01:07:21.859 --> 01:07:23.070
I don't do that anymore.

1185
01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:24.640
Cut that out. You owe me.

1186
01:07:24.714 --> 01:07:27.078
And with that pretty face.
you'll pay your debt in no time.

1187
01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:28.676
You're coming with us. otherwise

1188
01:07:28.718 --> 01:07:30.348
the old hag is paying off your debt. okay?

1189
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:31.656
Okay.

1190
01:07:31.836 --> 01:07:34.297
I'll go. Just please don't hurt her.

1191
01:07:34.476 --> 01:07:35.547
Go Amber. go.

1192
01:07:35.625 --> 01:07:36.703
Hey!

1193
01:07:38.217 --> 01:07:39.217
Oh!

1194
01:07:43.813 --> 01:07:45.413
Blue. stop!

1195
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:47.617
Blue stop it!

1196
01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:55.946
Let's go!

1197
01:08:00.559 --> 01:08:02.059
Come on. Let's go!

1198
01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.234
Hey. Amber.

1199
01:08:05.406 --> 01:08:06.442
Woo!

1200
01:08:06.484 --> 01:08:07.604
Oh no!

1201
01:08:08.086 --> 01:08:09.160
No!

1202
01:08:09.202 --> 01:08:10.511
Let's go!

1203
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.545
Alice. go check on Sophie.

1204
01:08:12.859 --> 01:08:14.888
And for my next trick.

1205
01:08:14.945 --> 01:08:16.901
I'm gonna spit up a little blood.

1206
01:08:16.956 --> 01:08:18.806
and then pass out for a little while.

1207
01:08:18.922 --> 01:08:21.311
You're okay here. Help is coming.

1208
01:08:24.318 --> 01:08:25.759
Get in the car!

1209
01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:27.672
Whoo! Let's go.

1210
01:08:47.515 --> 01:08:48.734
Derrick!

1211
01:09:06.748 --> 01:09:08.273
How's he doing?

1212
01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:13.053
He'll be fine.

1213
01:09:14.127 --> 01:09:15.227
He's just resting now.

1214
01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.193
He's doing fairly well.

1215
01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.312
What he needs is some good. healthy food.

1216
01:09:20.375 --> 01:09:22.128
He's really malnourished.

1217
01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:25.638
He'll recover from the beating.
but the damage he's doing

1218
01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.473
with the alcohol might be irreversible.

1219
01:09:29.523 --> 01:09:31.323
Thank you. Nurse Palmer. is it?

1220
01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:34.703
You haven't told us anything
we didn't know already.

1221
01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:37.086
Can I ask how long he's
been drinking like this?

1222
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:38.508
He's been drinking

1223
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:40.468
night and day ever since we've known him.

1224
01:09:40.530 --> 01:09:42.133
A year and a half?

1225
01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.103
As someone who's been there.

1226
01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:48.508
if he wants some help.

1227
01:09:48.564 --> 01:09:51.148
I'd be more than happy
to take him to a meeting.

1228
01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:52.380
Thanks.

1229
01:09:52.422 --> 01:09:53.656
We'll try.

1230
01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:54.734
It's a real long shot.

1231
01:09:54.783 --> 01:09:56.148
I'll bring him out too shortly.

1232
01:09:56.203 --> 01:09:57.812
Okay.

1233
01:10:00.233 --> 01:10:05.233
This is the second time
in my life I've felt powerless.

1234
01:10:07.911 --> 01:10:09.234
It really humbles you.

1235
01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:15.000
He'll pull through.

1236
01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:21.097
This is what happens when
you get caught up in this life.

1237
01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:24.511
I lost my husband and
my oldest son to addiction.

1238
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:26.840
I'll be damned if I lose my baby boy

1239
01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:28.443
because of some junkies.

1240
01:10:30.313 --> 01:10:33.283
Who is waiting for you. Alice?

1241
01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:35.763
Go back to them before you lose them too.

1242
01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:39.332
My name is Kathy.

1243
01:10:45.619 --> 01:10:48.097
It's a pleasure to meet you. Kathy.

1244
01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.652
My son

1245
01:10:51.138 --> 01:10:53.863
was killed in a mission in the Middle East.

1246
01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:57.425
My denial hurt my marriage and my career.

1247
01:10:57.837 --> 01:10:59.637
I lost many friends.

1248
01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:02.472
I didn't cash the death gratuity.

1249
01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.761
because taking the money meant

1250
01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:06.785
accepting that he was truly gone.

1251
01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:10.437
And I didn't wanna exist
in a world without him in it.

1252
01:11:15.166 --> 01:11:17.566
Had it not been for Bobby.

1253
01:11:17.837 --> 01:11:19.941
I'd be where you are right now.

1254
01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:25.618
I had to save him from that life.

1255
01:11:27.689 --> 01:11:29.410
Instead. he saved me.

1256
01:11:29.504 --> 01:11:32.543
When I saw him bloodied
on the floor like that.

1257
01:11:32.606 --> 01:11:33.996
I snapped.

1258
01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:36.393
In a way. he saved me too.

1259
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:39.824
Does it ever get easier?

1260
01:11:40.175 --> 01:11:41.597
The pain

1261
01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:43.503
Comes in waves.

1262
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:46.793
Not easier.

1263
01:11:49.814 --> 01:11:52.894
But the waves are less frequent.

1264
01:11:57.154 --> 01:11:58.357
Have you seen Kathy.

1265
01:12:01.438 --> 01:12:03.017
Heard from her?

1266
01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:12.210
Go home. Your husband needs you.

1267
01:12:13.694 --> 01:12:14.705
Thank you.

1268
01:12:14.901 --> 01:12:17.605
Thank you for giving me a win.

1269
01:12:19.737 --> 01:12:21.723
You know. Andrew.

1270
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:25.965
you really should come see us sometime.

1271
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.463
It's not that bad. I promise.

1272
01:12:31.429 --> 01:12:32.683
They got an open bar?

1273
01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.916
Thank you.

1274
01:12:35.136 --> 01:12:36.249
She cares.

1275
01:12:38.933 --> 01:12:41.323
Hey Andrew. you look like a mess.

1276
01:12:41.370 --> 01:12:43.473
Next time you should wear a helmet.

1277
01:12:45.646 --> 01:12:46.855
How you doing. Sophie?

1278
01:12:48.341 --> 01:12:49.961
I've seen better days.

1279
01:12:50.142 --> 01:12:51.912
Where's Alice? I
thought she was with you.

1280
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:53.853
She was called away.

1281
01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:56.170
Good for her.

1282
01:12:57.403 --> 01:12:59.080
I'm sorry about Blue.

1283
01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:00.810
I hate myself for not being there.

1284
01:13:00.879 --> 01:13:02.777
There's nothing you could have done.

1285
01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:05.152
No! If I see them again. I kill them.

1286
01:13:05.195 --> 01:13:06.198
Excuse me.

1287
01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.477
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1288
01:13:07.519 --> 01:13:09.840
Look at me. Let the
authorities deal with it.

1289
01:13:09.904 --> 01:13:11.332
There will be no more killing.

1290
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:15.542
Let's hold hands and
let's give a minute to Blue.

1291
01:13:21.807 --> 01:13:25.096
And they're doing a CT scan
and we should hear the results soon.

1292
01:13:25.287 --> 01:13:26.400
Ms Sophie?

1293
01:13:27.022 --> 01:13:28.042
Leslie!

1294
01:13:28.121 --> 01:13:30.214
- It's good to see you.
- You look terrific.

1295
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.010
You guys know each other?

1296
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:34.042
Oh. we go way back.

1297
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:36.284
Your boy. Andrew here is very talented.

1298
01:13:36.406 --> 01:13:38.182
Ooh. What did he do?

1299
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.081
There were a couple
of kids waiting for X-rays.

1300
01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:44.514
And even as banged up
as he is. he managed to do

1301
01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:47.763
some very impressive magic
tricks to keep their mind off it.

1302
01:13:49.233 --> 01:13:51.343
It was kind wonderful.

1303
01:13:51.389 --> 01:13:52.480
She means Amazing.

1304
01:13:52.522 --> 01:13:55.077
If you're up for an encore performance.

1305
01:13:55.152 --> 01:13:56.543
there's a little girl who came in.

1306
01:13:56.585 --> 01:13:59.507
She had a seizure. I
think she's a bit frightened.

1307
01:13:59.663 --> 01:14:00.777
A couple magic tricks

1308
01:14:00.819 --> 01:14:03.296
might help take her
mind off things for a while.

1309
01:14:03.514 --> 01:14:04.583
Go. do it.

1310
01:14:05.663 --> 01:14:07.514
Be Amazing for that little girl.

1311
01:14:11.671 --> 01:14:13.653
Apres toi. mademoiselle.

1312
01:14:14.913 --> 01:14:16.037
Merci. monsieur.

1313
01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:17.628
Who wants some coffee?

1314
01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:18.678
Oh. I do.

1315
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:23.059
I'll buy. if you go get it.

1316
01:14:23.105 --> 01:14:24.948
That's a fair trade.

1317
01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:26.263
Come with me. Huevo.

1318
01:14:26.305 --> 01:14:28.060
We're just gonna take a little bit longer.

1319
01:14:28.102 --> 01:14:32.183
We wanna catch the show
of the Amazing Andrew.

1320
01:15:00.226 --> 01:15:01.329
Hi.

1321
01:15:03.858 --> 01:15:05.622
Drop it. Drop it.

1322
01:15:07.242 --> 01:15:08.242
Hehehe.

1323
01:15:17.696 --> 01:15:18.696
Come on.

1324
01:15:25.344 --> 01:15:26.344
Hehehe.

1325
01:15:29.015 --> 01:15:30.070
Kathy!

1326
01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:35.250
You're back!

1327
01:16:02.649 --> 01:16:03.797
Somebody. quickly.

1328
01:16:03.884 --> 01:16:05.874
We got a live one here. We need a medic.

1329
01:16:05.921 --> 01:16:06.941
Nurse!

1330
01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:09.441
Female. 20's. lacerations on her face.

1331
01:16:11.049 --> 01:16:12.051
I know.

1332
01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:14.152
Derek is dead.

1333
01:16:15.315 --> 01:16:16.695
He's here.

1334
01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.273
He'll always be here.

1335
01:16:19.855 --> 01:16:22.152
I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused you.

1336
01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.693
I know you miss him as much as I do.

1337
01:16:25.615 --> 01:16:27.043
Can you ever forgive me?

1338
01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.988
There's nothing to forgive.

1339
01:16:29.150 --> 01:16:30.574
We have each other again.

1340
01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:31.988
That's all that matters.

1341
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:34.418
Can we do this? Can we move on?

1342
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:36.816
Moving on doesn't mean forgetting.

1343
01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:38.832
It means opening your heart

1344
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.300
to accept with love the
memories we've made.

1345
01:16:43.287 --> 01:16:45.147
Together. we can do it.

1346
01:16:48.831 --> 01:16:50.008
I love you.

1347
01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:54.871
Hey. you're awake.

1348
01:16:54.945 --> 01:16:56.488
I'm lucky I have a thick skull.

1349
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:58.027
Don't mind if I do. - Thank you.

1350
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:59.658
Nurse Palmer let us see Andy

1351
01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.221
with the kids in the children's ward.

1352
01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:03.984
The kids were so excited.
they forgot about everything.

1353
01:17:04.026 --> 01:17:05.135
And this little boy.

1354
01:17:05.206 --> 01:17:07.354
he didn't have any hair
and he couldn't even sit up.

1355
01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:11.979
His eyes lit up when Andy
pulled a coin out of his ear.

1356
01:17:12.237 --> 01:17:14.028
And the nurse said
that it was the first time

1357
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:16.036
he smiled since his last chemo treatment.

1358
01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:18.387
I am so proud of you. Andrew.

1359
01:17:18.652 --> 01:17:21.239
And I think nurse Palmer
kinda of likes Andy too.

1360
01:17:21.325 --> 01:17:22.434
Don't kid yourself.

1361
01:17:22.567 --> 01:17:24.473
She's just trying to get
me to an AA meeting.

1362
01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:27.286
Miss Leslie Palmer was as
big a mess as you are right now.

1363
01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:30.755
And she turned her life
around. You should listen to her.

1364
01:17:30.853 --> 01:17:32.419
She got herself out?

1365
01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:34.559
It takes
somebody to care a little bit.

1366
01:17:34.609 --> 01:17:36.674
It's enough to just get
you back on the right track.

1367
01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.668
Ms Sophie. Can I see you a minute?

1368
01:17:39.801 --> 01:17:42.645
Yeah. yes of course. I'll be right back.

1369
01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:45.939
What is it Leslie?

1370
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:48.356
We had a young girl come
in. and she gave you her name

1371
01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.590
and Cottonwood as her contact information.

1372
01:17:50.730 --> 01:17:52.473
Is it Amber? Is she here?

1373
01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.520
That is the name she gave us. yeah.

1374
01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:55.920
How is she? Can I see her?

1375
01:17:55.981 --> 01:17:57.343
She's still being assessed.

1376
01:17:57.385 --> 01:17:59.723
She's stable for now.
We gave her a sedative.

1377
01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:04.239
What is it. Leslie?

1378
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:06.000
Her wounds were self inflicted.

1379
01:18:07.530 --> 01:18:09.872
What did she do to herself?

1380
01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.395
She gouged the skin off
her face with her fingernails.

1381
01:18:14.130 --> 01:18:16.301
How? Why? Has she said anything?

1382
01:18:16.410 --> 01:18:18.036
She hasn't spoken to anybody.

1383
01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.683
We're running a tox screen.

1384
01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:22.300
We think drugs were involved.

1385
01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.100
Thank you.

1386
01:18:33.794 --> 01:18:34.920
Hi.

1387
01:18:41.517 --> 01:18:44.262
I'm so happy you're alive.

1388
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:46.692
The cops went to the X's hang out.

1389
01:18:46.794 --> 01:18:48.645
and when they didn't find you there

1390
01:18:49.579 --> 01:18:51.723
we were expecting the worst.

1391
01:18:56.413 --> 01:18:58.413
I did it. Ms Sophie.

1392
01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:03.272
I didn't hesitate. Ms Sophie.

1393
01:19:03.347 --> 01:19:06.600
I did it. I wouldn't be pretty no more.

1394
01:19:06.848 --> 01:19:09.100
They couldn't sell me no more.

1395
01:19:09.210 --> 01:19:10.440
I made up my mind.

1396
01:19:10.521 --> 01:19:13.879
I was gonna go to school and

1397
01:19:15.294 --> 01:19:16.981
get me a GED.

1398
01:19:18.022 --> 01:19:19.439
I was no good to them.

1399
01:19:22.408 --> 01:19:23.777
They told me that

1400
01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:26.946
I was useless now. and

1401
01:19:27.211 --> 01:19:28.985
that I'm worthless.

1402
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:31.009
And then

1403
01:19:32.438 --> 01:19:34.384
they threw me out of the car.

1404
01:19:35.673 --> 01:19:37.262
because I'm garbage.

1405
01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.590
I'm so sorry.

1406
01:19:41.724 --> 01:19:43.474
It's okay. It's okay.

1407
01:19:44.455 --> 01:19:47.150
You're going to be okay. I got you now.

1408
01:19:53.838 --> 01:19:54.998
Mini Prob.

1409
01:19:55.049 --> 01:19:56.049
Hoo.

1410
01:20:24.343 --> 01:20:26.732
This is such a cute check.

1411
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.236
I can't wait to see
Georgina's face when I give it to her.

1412
01:20:30.674 --> 01:20:32.977
We wanted to
put the money to good use.

1413
01:20:33.103 --> 01:20:36.693
It was an appropriate way
to honor Derek's memory.

1414
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:38.564
Thank you.

1415
01:20:39.424 --> 01:20:40.523
A toast.

1416
01:20:42.878 --> 01:20:46.361
Cottonwood welcomes
the motley crew of society.

1417
01:20:46.854 --> 01:20:49.884
We're safe. It's our home.

1418
01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:51.310
May her doors never close.

1419
01:20:52.168 --> 01:20:53.897
Salud! - Salud.

1420
01:20:56.105 --> 01:20:57.105
Hum. hm!

1421
01:20:58.223 --> 01:20:59.762
It's time.

1422
01:21:10.768 --> 01:21:12.096
Work hard. okay?

1423
01:21:13.347 --> 01:21:15.206
I will. You too. - You got this.

1424
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:16.518
Argh! Come here!

1425
01:21:17.909 --> 01:21:19.081
