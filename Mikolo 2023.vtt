3
00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:41.458
And there I was.

4
00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.375
hiding for my precious life.

5
00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:49.208
Making sure these
monsters don't find me.

6
00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:04.625
(Babablu)- Ah!

7
00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.666
How did I get here?

8
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.458
Oh my!
What am I doing in a forest

9
00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:13.291
by a volcanic mountain inside Gbagi village?

10
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.250
And suddenly "boom"!

11
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.250
This big demon appeared behind me.

12
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.250
I turned around.

13
00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:24.833
and screamed

14
00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:27.833
Oh my goodness!

15
00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:30.083
(Habeeb)- Ahhhhh...

16
00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:31.541
Nope!

17
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.416
It's not a demon...

18
00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:36.833
Maybe a jaguar or gorilla.

19
00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:38.500
Demons don't even live in forest...

20
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.750
(Habeeb)- Why are we even talking about that?
(Funke)-Habeeb!

21
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.791
(Habeeb)- They live in...

22
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:42.916
(Funke)- Stop interupting!
That is very rude.

23
00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:44.291
(Habeeb)- Oh I am sorry.

24
00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:45.916
(Funke)- Baba blu. please continue.

25
00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:48.125
(Babablu)- Alright!
Where was I?

26
00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:58.833
I wasn't afraid...

27
00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:02.250
I picked up a piece of rock and shouted

28
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.041
Come at me!

29
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.041
Come at me all of you!

30
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:09.041
Fight me!

31
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:10.916
Ahhhh!

32
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.041
Oh you don't me? It's okay.

33
00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:36.125
So what happened next?

34
00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:39.250
I was ready to destroy them.

35
00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:43.875
Suddenly!

36
00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:50.000
The warrior of the forest appeared.

37
00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958
Yes! Irumole forest.

38
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.541
They call him "Abula".

39
00:02:57.791 --> 00:03:02.125
He controls all the creatures with a flute.

40
00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:18.083
I have never seen anything
like that before in my life.

41
00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:54.916
I saw it.

42
00:03:55.083 --> 00:03:57.000
I saw everything!

43
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.125
He has a pointy ear like a cat.

44
00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:01.708
No you did not.

45
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.625
Oh babablu! We are already running late.

46
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:06.791
I am sorry ma.
I will be done in a giffy.

47
00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:09.791
- Mummy.
- Yes?

48
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.625
Where does grandma live?

49
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.750
Babablu said where she lives
has a lot of mountains and..

50
00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:17.458
there is a volcanic mountain there too.

51
00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:21.041
Funke.

52
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:24.958
Where your grandma lives
is a small quite town.

53
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.333
With lots of mountains around it.

54
00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.541
What kind of mountains?

55
00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:32.875
I don't know.

56
00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:33.708
But you grew up there.

57
00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:35.208
Funke!

58
00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:38.375
Have you packed all your things?

59
00:04:38.541 --> 00:04:40.291
Oh!
My comic!

60
00:05:01.416 --> 00:05:03.125
Look at this.

61
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.916
These are wild animals.

62
00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:07.250
I know what I saw.

63
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.333
Maybe you were tired and fell asleep.

64
00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:10.458
No!

65
00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:13.375
It was a secret place in the kingdom.

66
00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:15.000
And only you saw it?

67
00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:19.375
Can you draw them?

68
00:05:19.458 --> 00:05:20.916
Do they look like this?

69
00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:22.000
Like how?

70
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.041
I know more than you. stop arguing.

71
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:27.041
- It's okay.
- Yes ma.

72
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.458
Please...

73
00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:38.625
- Please help me give the trash
to the collectors when they come.
- Okay ma

74
00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.916
Alright.
Thank you very much.

75
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:46.625
Not animals. Demons. strange creatures.

76
00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:49.208
Not true. prove it.

77
00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:50.791
No I won't

78
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:51.750
You're an unbeliever.

79
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.458
Me. unbeliever!

80
00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:55.791
Me? A scientist? You're calling me an unbeliever?

81
00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:58.250
Look at this nine years old boy with a big mouth.

82
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.125
- I am ten actually
- Nine-plus

83
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.291
- Ten!
{Yoruba}- You're Nine-plus!

84
00:06:01.291 --> 00:06:02.083
Oh God!

85
00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:05.333
- See I don't have your time.
- You won't have my time.

86
00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:07.333
{Yoruba}- Such little child.

87
00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:08.083
Babablu!

88
00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:10.333
Funke?

89
00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:12.541
How do I find the forest?

90
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:22.541
- Funke
- What is this?

91
00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:25.208
To find the forest.

92
00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:27.791
- Coming
- Let's go!

93
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:30.583
- She's already going into the car.
- Are you not the one wasting her time?

94
00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:33.250
Unbeliever!
Nine-plus.

95
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.291
What's that?

96
00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:56.708
None of your business.

97
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:06.375
Humans can't survive in forests alone.

98
00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:09.500
- He is lying.
- Yes they can. Tarzan. Mowgli.

99
00:07:09.708 --> 00:07:10.458
They are not real.

100
00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:12.208
- Yes they are..
- No they are not..

101
00:07:12.208 --> 00:07:14.000
Yes they are. you're just dumb.

102
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.500
No I'm not. You are the one that's just so childish.

103
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.333
Childish! You big head.

104
00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:19.333
- I'm big head?
- Yes!

105
00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:20.833
- You are big ...
- Big what?

106
00:07:20.833 --> 00:07:22.958
- Say it! I will just slap you.
- Funke

107
00:07:23.666 --> 00:07:25.583
- Mummy he started it!
- I didn't.

108
00:07:25.583 --> 00:07:27.291
I don't want to hear it.

109
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:29.125
One more word from the both of you.
I will park this car

110
00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:30.291
and smack the two of you.

111
00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:33.083
I have a headache for goodness sake!

112
00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:36.083
{Yoruba}- What is it.
do you want to kill me?

113
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.125
Funke!

114
00:07:50.416 --> 00:07:53.416
- Mummy
- Yes. funke

115
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:56.541
- Do you want to ease yourself as well?
- No.

116
00:07:57.333 --> 00:07:59.416
Okay.

117
00:08:00.583 --> 00:08:03.583
Will daddy come this holiday?

118
00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:07.250
It's been a whole year.

119
00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:13.125
I miss daddy.

120
00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:18.416
Okay! Don't worry I will ask him.

121
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.750
Okay. we have to go now
it's getting late. let's go.

122
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.333
- Are you okay now?
- Yes I'm okay.

123
00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:35.791
Your grandma will be
very excited to see you two.

124
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:39.583
Do you remember
what she looks like?

125
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:43.166
I bet you two
will have a lot of fun.

126
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.000
Are you divorcing daddy?

127
00:08:47.041 --> 00:08:48.708
What?

128
00:08:48.708 --> 00:08:49.875
Oh my goodness!

129
00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:51.708
Funke. where
did you hear that?

130
00:08:51.708 --> 00:08:53.541
He never comes
to the house anymore.

131
00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:55.791
and this is the
second holiday without him.

132
00:08:55.791 --> 00:08:56.500
Yeah but I have told you.

133
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.375
your father works
far away from home.

134
00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:00.166
Then why don't you
let us call him?

135
00:09:00.166 --> 00:09:01.500
Young lady!

136
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.583
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I want my own phone.

137
00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:05.500
There's no way
I'm giving you a phone.

138
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.208
and. you and I have
talked about this Funke.

139
00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:11.750
I've told you. your father is a very busy man.

140
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.375
and he calls whenever he can.

141
00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:16.375
And I always let him
talk to you when he calls.

142
00:09:18.916 --> 00:09:20.166
I've been calling him
for the past one week.

143
00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:23.166
he has not responded
to my calls or messages.

144
00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:26.958
I'm doing everything I possibly can.

145
00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:31.041
and that is very very unfair of you Funke.

146
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:37.458
I'm sorry Mum.

147
00:09:37.916 --> 00:09:39.833
I just...

148
00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.666
I miss him.

149
00:09:45.708 --> 00:09:48.708
I miss him too.

150
00:10:23.541 --> 00:10:26.541
It's okay.

151
00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:30.416
Mummy look at this.

152
00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:33.166
When you believe in the
impossible things long enough.

153
00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:34.500
they become possible.

154
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.250
hmmm...

155
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.375
I'll remember that.

156
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:42.416
Funke my baby!

157
00:10:42.416 --> 00:10:45.000
Grandma!

158
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.375
Hello my dear.

159
00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:48.875
- Hello.
- How are you doing?

160
00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:52.541
My boy. how are you?

161
00:10:53.916 --> 00:10:56.916
What did I tell you
guys about greeting your elders?

162
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
{Yoruba}- Good evening Ma!
{Yoruba}- Good evening Ma!

163
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.291
{Yoruba}- That's it.
welcome my beautiful grandchildren.

164
00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:05.083
{Yoruba}- That's better.

165
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.750
Wow...

166
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:18.375
You have a pendulum clock. home tv. a compact disc.

167
00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:22.208
- Grandma!
- Yes my love.

168
00:11:22.208 --> 00:11:25.500
- Is this a gramophone?
- Habeeb.

169
00:11:26.291 --> 00:11:28.333
I'm not that old.

170
00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:30.166
That's not a gramophone.

171
00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:33.166
It's just a record player.

172
00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:36.791
Be careful with it.

173
00:11:36.791 --> 00:11:38.625
And who's going to
carry your bags inside for you?

174
00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:41.208
{Yoruba}- Please don't stress my grandchildren

175
00:11:41.208 --> 00:11:45.166
- Lara! Lara!
- Ma!

176
00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958
{Yoruba}- Go bring the kids' lauggage inside.

177
00:11:51.666 --> 00:11:53.791
Habeeb! Stop
touching everything.

178
00:11:53.791 --> 00:11:57.458
It's okay. they're just kids.
Leave them alone.

179
00:11:57.833 --> 00:12:00.833
And why is she this skinny?

180
00:12:01.291 --> 00:12:02.041
Habeeb!

181
00:12:02.041 --> 00:12:05.041
Because she's very
choosy. she will not eat anything.

182
00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:09.458
But mummy you
were also a skinny little girl.

183
00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:19.541
- Look at her classmates.
- Give me that.

184
00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:24.833
That's a greeting card.
people used to give this

185
00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:27.291

186
00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:30.291
Wow!

187
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.500

188
00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:46.416
- What's it's name?
- Oh that one. it's name is "Tanko".

189
00:12:46.916 --> 00:12:51.500
Your mother brought
it home on her fifth birthday.

190
00:12:52.083 --> 00:12:55.083
as a gift for herself.

191
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.958

- Wow.
- Wait. mummy you were an explorer?

194
00:13:19.083 --> 00:13:24.458
Your mother? She was
a wild adventurous little girl.

195
00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:31.958
And that is why people called her
"Lola the inquisitive girl".

196
00:13:34.083 --> 00:13:38.916
You know what that means?
An inquisitive person.

197
00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:45.166
Your mother. she wants
to know anything and everything.

198
00:13:45.333 --> 00:13:46.583
She will always ask questions.

199
00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:49.583
Okay... It's time for you to go and change.

200
00:13:49.583 --> 00:13:52.416
-Quickly go and freshen up.

Freshen up and then come back.

202
00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.958
We'll continue the gist
and you'll have your juice.

203
00:13:58.291 --> 00:14:06.583
(singing)- Lola the inquisitive girl.

204
00:14:10.458 --> 00:14:13.875
Whoa! This must have been mummys' room.

205
00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:22.833
Habeeb! We can see
the mountains from here.

206
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:30.291
Whoa! Kites!

207
00:14:34.458 --> 00:14:36.541

208
00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.875
Where's the Imulore forest?

209
00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:53.125
"IRUMOLE'
Now say it correctly!

210
00:14:53.666 --> 00:14:56.083
I-ru-mo-le.

211
00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:57.708
Good girl.

212
00:14:57.708 --> 00:15:00.000
And where did that one come from?

213
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.416
It's an old neighbour. who
likes to tell them silly stories.

214
00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.625
Do you know what Irumole means?

215
00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:10.083
Magical creatures. spirits!

216
00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:13.541
The only thing I've ever seen in the forest

217
00:15:13.541 --> 00:15:18.666
are animals and some of them can be so wild.

218
00:15:20.458 --> 00:15:21.291
I told...

219
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:23.916

Careful. careful boy. take it easy.

223
00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958
Why were you talking while you're eating?

224
00:15:35.666 --> 00:15:38.666
Are you alright? Sure?

225
00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:42.791
You see that's what
happens when you talk too much.

226
00:15:42.791 --> 00:15:45.125
Funke!

227
00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:51.916
When you believe in impossible things long enough.
they become possible.

228
00:16:02.583 --> 00:16:05.041
Funke baby!

229
00:16:05.041 --> 00:16:07.083
Grandma. good morning.

230
00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:10.083
Would you like to do something today?

231
00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:13.041
Would you like to go
visit the warm springs?

232
00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:14.375
Though it's a river.

233
00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:17.750
- but the water inside is hot.
- Oh my God. thank you!

234
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.125
I know what a warm spring... I know what it is.

235
00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:22.083
Thank you grandma!

236
00:16:22.083 --> 00:16:25.083
- And you know what?
- What?

237
00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:33.791
If you leave early. you might be able to
catch a rare golden catfish.

238
00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:37.125
What! Oh my god! Habeeb!

239
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.541

- A what?
- You need to hurry up.

241
00:16:46.416 --> 00:16:49.416
If you want to see the golden catfish.

242
00:16:51.458 --> 00:16:54.458
Wait! But there's no such thing as the golden catfish.

243
00:16:55.708 --> 00:16:58.708
- Yes there is.
- But I don't want to go any...

244
00:17:00.166 --> 00:17:03.166
- What's that?
- Mind your business and get ready.

245
00:17:08.708 --> 00:17:11.333
Mummy I have to go.

246
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:16.875
- Today?
- Yes.

247
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.875
I have a training.
it will take four weeks

248
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.750
And I need it for my promotion.

249
00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958
I..I need to start thinking of my own future.

250
00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:32.583
- Omolola.
- Yes Mummy.

251
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.125
Is this about your husband?

252
00:17:38.083 --> 00:17:39.000
{Yoruba}- Answer me.

253
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
- Is this about Malik?
- It doesn't matter.

254
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.750
He can stay over there in the U.K.

255
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.750
I personally don't have any plans to go over there
and stay with him.

256
00:17:48.916 --> 00:17:51.250
because my career is here.

257
00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.750
I cannot leave my career behind...

258
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.666
Will you atleast tell your children?

259
00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:58.583
I don't know.

260
00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:02.041
I have made so much sacrifices for those children.

261
00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:06.458
Mummy I have to go to Lagos.

262
00:18:06.458 --> 00:18:09.916
It's okay. I will handle things here.

263
00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:13.083
The children will be fine!

264
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:18.208
But my dear. think about your children?

265
00:18:18.708 --> 00:18:21.000
I know Malik will do the right thing.

266
00:18:21.666 --> 00:18:25.000

- No it's fine..

{Yoruba}- Look. leave my
grandson alone. Let him be.

296
00:20:01.416 --> 00:20:05.583
Not this way.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:11.333
Hey. young lady come here.

Habeeb put your ipad inside.

319
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:18.333
Ah! No one steals phones here.

320
00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:22.250
This isn't Lagos. this is
Gbagi they don't steal here.

00:22:25.666 --> 00:22:26.958
How hot is the spring?

Ah! See. you
can use it to make hot "Eba".

Hmmm.

338
00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:34.416
Does that mean the hot water is going to go
"poof" from the ground?

339
00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:38.375
Those are geysers. and you can only find
geysers near volcanic mountains.

340
00:22:39.166 --> 00:22:40.833
Mr know-it-all! What makes you think

341
00:22:40.833 --> 00:22:43.041
that there are no volcanic
mountains around here?

342
00:22:43.041 --> 00:22:46.041
Uncle Jay-Jay! Is there a
volacanic mountain around?

Just say lava! Ah!

347

{Yoruba}- Irumole forest?

350
00:23:06.958 --> 00:23:09.958
Ah! It's real? I knew
it. I knew it was real.

351
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.791
That means I'm right and you're wrong.

352
00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:13.208
and Babablu was right too.

353
00:23:13.208 --> 00:23:16.208
- Come on
- Let's go. let's go.

354
00:23:16.416 --> 00:23:19.416
Wait!

355
00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:32.833
- Where is it. where is it?
- It's here. see it.

356
00:23:32.833 --> 00:23:35.375
Your grandma said I should take
you to see the gold catfish.

357
00:23:35.375 --> 00:23:37.041
- No...
- Yes!

358
00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:39.041
Why do you like
dangerous things Funke?

359
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:41.166
Because I'm not a coward like you.

360
00:23:41.166 --> 00:23:44.166
Haha. very funny. I'm not a coward.

361
00:23:44.166 --> 00:23:45.916
- Yes you are.
- No I'm not.

362
00:23:45.916 --> 00:23:48.166
- Yes you are.
- Fine!

363
00:23:48.166 --> 00:23:51.166
Uncle Jay-Jay. take us to the Iramole forest.

364
00:23:51.583 --> 00:23:52.958
{Yoruba}- Irumole forest.

365
00:23:52.958 --> 00:23:53.791
The forest.

366
00:23:53.791 --> 00:23:54.708
Ah!

367
00:23:54.708 --> 00:23:57.708
You people don't want
to see the gold catfish again?

368
00:23:57.833 --> 00:24:00.833
Okay. get ready to walk. Let's go.

369
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:04.583
You''ll walk. I'm saying it now.
Don't say I did not tell you.

370
00:24:04.583 --> 00:24:07.666
You'll walk! It's okay. let's go.

371
00:24:08.125 --> 00:24:10.833
I have told you.

372
00:24:17.375 --> 00:24:20.375
- You guys. hurry up!
- I'm coming.

373
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Habeeb. walk faster.

374
00:24:32.875 --> 00:24:35.875
You guys are being too slow.

375
00:24:37.541 --> 00:24:39.916
Ah...

376
00:24:42.666 --> 00:24:47.041
Whoa! That's a
huge tooth. is it real?

377
00:24:47.916 --> 00:24:50.916
Leave me alone. It's
from the big bush meat.

378
00:24:51.583 --> 00:24:53.708
Like a Lion?

379
00:24:53.708 --> 00:24:56.000
Like a Jaguar?

380
00:24:56.166 --> 00:24:59.166
{Yoruba}- Don't stress me.

381
00:25:02.166 --> 00:25:05.166
- Uncle Jay-jay.
- Yes.

382
00:25:24.041 --> 00:25:26.625
That's the Irumole forest!

383
00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:29.625
It's so beautiful.

384
00:25:30.583 --> 00:25:33.208
Echo!

385
00:25:33.208 --> 00:25:34.958
That's amazing.

386
00:25:34.958 --> 00:25:37.958
This was so worth it.

387
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.750
Hurry up. take a picture.

388
00:25:52.416 --> 00:25:55.583
You guys. go and take your pictures and
let's leave here on time.

389
00:25:55.583 --> 00:25:56.375
Ah.

390
00:25:56.375 --> 00:25:56.833
What are we doing?

391
00:25:57.041 --> 00:25:58.416
{Yoruba}- This has taken all day.

392
00:25:58.916 --> 00:26:04.250
It's so beautiful. I could
literally live here forever.

393
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.750
There're so many mountains.

394
00:26:15.708 --> 00:26:17.333
Whoa!

395
00:26:17.333 --> 00:26:20.333
Let me see.

396
00:26:20.708 --> 00:26:21.958
Whoa!

397
00:26:21.958 --> 00:26:24.916
Babablu was right.
there's smoke coming out.

398
00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:26.875
Who's Babablu?

399
00:26:26.875 --> 00:26:30.583
He's a neighbour. He says that the forest
has spirits and monsters.

400
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.833
{Yoruba}- Babablu does not
know what he is talking about.

401
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.791
How does he know?
Nobody knows. there's no bridge.

402
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:41.166
Nothing comes to this place. nothing!

403
00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:43.791
Yes. I knew it. it was fake!

404
00:26:43.791 --> 00:26:45.750
I was right. In your face!

405
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.375
Now give me that.

406
00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:52.041
Hold on. do you know what this is?

407
00:26:52.458 --> 00:26:53.583
Is this sweet?

408
00:26:54.625 --> 00:26:55.791
[Yoruba]- This looks like
that 'babadudu' sweet.

409
00:26:55.833 --> 00:26:57.750
I don't know what this is.

410
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.541
Habeeb. we have to come back tomorrow.

411
00:26:59.541 --> 00:27:01.375
- Maybe we can like ...
- Wait. you and who will come

412
00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:04.125
back to this place? Me. come
back to this place tomorrow?

413
00:27:04.125 --> 00:27:06.250
Even if it is said that it's on this mountain
that my problems

414
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.291
would be solved. I will
never come back to this place.

415
00:27:08.291 --> 00:27:10.333
Despite how you have stressed me?

416
00:27:10.333 --> 00:27:14.041
You both still have strong bones unlike
mine that is weak already.

417
00:27:14.083 --> 00:27:15.333
So I should come back to this place?

418
00:27:15.375 --> 00:27:17.666
{Yoruba}- Don't try that nonsense with me.

419
00:27:17.708 --> 00:27:20.000
Are you both done with your pictures?

420
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.333
{Yoruba}- let's go!

421
00:27:25.833 --> 00:27:27.083

Yeah. I hope you're still
watching over my kids for me?

425
00:27:34.375 --> 00:27:36.208
Yes. I'm watching over them.

426

[Crowds jubilating]

427
00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:42.625
I know she's going to be worrying you
that she wants to go to a forest.

428
00:27:42.958 --> 00:27:45.958
{Yoruba}- Don't listen
to her. please I'm begging you.

429
00:27:45.958 --> 00:27:48.958
- Don't take her to any forest.
- That will never happen ma.

430
00:27:49.208 --> 00:27:51.416
- No. don't worry ma.
- And I hope she's not running

431
00:27:51.416 --> 00:27:53.083
around causing
any problems for you?

432
00:27:53.083 --> 00:27:56.083
Ah. not at all.

433
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.500
Is it not her voice I am
hearing in the background?

434
00:28:03.833 --> 00:28:06.000
Hello?

435
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.208
Jay-Jay?

436
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.833
{Yoruba}- I'm in trouble. this
girl has caused big trouble for me.

437

Please. please!

00:28:11.416 --> 00:28:12.583
(Fisherman) Who is
your father in this village?

439
00:28:12.583 --> 00:28:21.833
{Yoruba}- Please don't be angry. Please
don't get angry with her.

440
00:28:22.041 --> 00:28:23.791
She threw our food away.
Please be patient with her.

441
00:28:23.791 --> 00:28:26.000
- they came from Lagos.
- So what if they are from Lagos?

442
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.166
I'm sorry.

443
00:28:27.166 --> 00:28:30.166
Funke. what are you doing? Don't
you know this is people's food?

444
00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:33.416
{Yoruba}- I'm sorry.
please don't get angry.

445
00:28:33.416 --> 00:28:35.625
This way. this way.

(Fisherman) I'm sorry. my friend.

447
00:28:39.666 --> 00:28:42.666
I will report you to your
mummy. naughty children!

448
00:28:42.708 --> 00:28:47.708
- Just to receive a call...
- Oh! I forgot my binoculars!

449
00:28:48.333 --> 00:28:49.500
'Bino" what?

450
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.708
Binoculars!. It's on the cliff.

451
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:53.250
What sort of...?

452
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.250
What kind of. what
kind of rubbish is this?

453
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.166
- Uncle Jay-Jay.
- Yes.

454
00:29:04.166 --> 00:29:07.166
I thought you said animals don't come here?

455
00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:13.833
- Maybe it's a bird.
- No. look at the teeth marks.

456
00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:18.541
Look. lets get going. Maybe you had
finished it before leaving it behind.

457
00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:21.833
What was that?

458
00:29:24.791 --> 00:29:28.708
- Stange magical creat...
- No. let's just go.

459
00:29:28.708 --> 00:29:30.916

Let's go!

{Yoruba}- Ma'am there were some trouble.

467
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.125
Especially with Funke. She carried a man's fish

468
00:31:20.125 --> 00:31:20.916
and threw it into the spring.

469
00:31:20.916 --> 00:31:23.916
Because of this. fish has become scarce in the village.

470
00:31:23.916 --> 00:31:28.125
Everywhere was scattered
and it was very chaotic.

471
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.916
Good evening grandma.

472
00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:21.583

This isn't funny!

Oh no. no. no. no. no. no!

Oh my God!

Strange... Magical... Creature.

00:38:19.916 --> 00:38:22.916
Are you from the 'Irumole' forest?

00:38:27.708 --> 00:38:28.625
(Screams)

490
00:38:28.625 --> 00:38:29.791
Please. please. please. please. Stop!

491
00:38:29.791 --> 00:38:32.791
I love all creatures. I promise.

492
00:38:49.041 --> 00:38:52.041
What are you?

493
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:09.750
It's okay. You can come out now.

494
00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:13.541
Come here.

495
00:39:22.708 --> 00:39:25.708
You scared me.

496
00:39:32.125 --> 00:39:35.125
What am I going to do with you?

497
00:39:35.625 --> 00:39:39.500
Oh! Do you know what this is?

498
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:43.750
Do you know Babablu?

499
00:39:45.041 --> 00:39:49.166
You don't like it?
That's.. That's fine.

500
00:39:52.833 --> 00:39:58.333
Are you lost? Do
you want to go home?

501
00:39:59.125 --> 00:40:05.000
Where's your
home? Are you okay?

502
00:40:07.041 --> 00:40:11.625
Eww! Uh great.
you ruin my book.

503
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:20.708
Are you hungry?
What exactly do you eat?

504
00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:28.250
Oh. you like the dog from
my book? His name is Mikolo.

505
00:40:28.458 --> 00:40:31.458
And he loves food just like you.

506
00:40:35.958 --> 00:40:41.000
I shall call you "Mikolo".

507
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.833
Mikolo!

508
00:40:49.833 --> 00:40:52.458
Don't worry. tomorrow
I will try to get you home

509
00:40:52.458 --> 00:40:58.583
and get you food too. But for now.
we have to keep this a secret.

510
00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:04.416
This is like our little secret!

511
00:41:29.708 --> 00:41:32.708
Funke! I...
I had a bad dream.

512
00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:37.833
- O--kay
- No. really. I saw a monster

513
00:41:37.833 --> 00:41:41.416
- He was breathing fire. like he was so big.
- Fire?

514
00:41:41.791 --> 00:41:45.958
But you said Monsters don't exist?

515
00:41:46.083 --> 00:41:51.250
- Well.
- Exactly. so you are lying?

516
00:41:51.333 --> 00:41:54.333
No I am not. it's just a bad dream.

517
00:41:54.458 --> 00:41:55.625
Monsters don't exist.

518
00:41:55.625 --> 00:41:58.625
- And no animal can breathe.
- Fire.

519
00:42:00.166 --> 00:42:03.166
What?

520
00:42:06.083 --> 00:42:10.000
- Look!
- What's funny?

521
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.541
- Look at it now.
- What! So you have a new teddy bear?

522
00:42:16.291 --> 00:42:19.416
I don't want a teddy.... Ah!

523
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.583
What is that? Grandma!! Open the door.

524
00:42:27.416 --> 00:42:30.833
I am going to die... Grandma open the door!

525
00:42:30.833 --> 00:42:34.250
Habeeb. you are not going to die.

526
00:42:34.583 --> 00:42:37.583
Calm down. it's harmless. Look.

527
00:42:39.791 --> 00:42:44.500
- Oh my god. I am gonna die.
- We are not gonna die.

528
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.583
and it's not a dragon.

529
00:42:46.583 --> 00:42:49.541
- It's a big wolf with fat face feathers.
- No it's not!

530
00:42:49.541 --> 00:42:50.666
That's not even a real thing.

531
00:42:50.833 --> 00:42:55.916
- Habeeb calm down.
- So what is it?

532
00:42:56.708 --> 00:42:59.708
Meet Mikolo!

533
00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:02.958
- What is a Mikolo?
- So you know those creatures

534
00:43:02.958 --> 00:43:04.333
Babablu is always telling us about right?

535
00:43:04.333 --> 00:43:08.458
Yeah the other time when we went to the
I-MU-LO-RE forest.

536
00:43:08.458 --> 00:43:09.083
while we were on the cliff.

537
00:43:09.083 --> 00:43:11.458
it must have entered our
bag because the other night.

538
00:43:11.458 --> 00:43:14.291
I saw a lot of fire flies and
then they were like "poof"

539
00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:18.291
and I was like "ahhhh"
and then I met. "Mikolo".

540
00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:25.458
Come on. he is harmless.
Habeeb. come. he is harmless.

541
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:32.208
I promise. he is harmless. Habeeb.

542
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:36.291
Come...

543
00:43:43.583 --> 00:43:50.166
What a baby! Habeeb wake up.

544
00:43:52.083 --> 00:43:56.750
- Are you children okay?
- Yes granny.

545
00:43:58.291 --> 00:44:00.458
But why did you lock the door?

546
00:44:00.458 --> 00:44:03.291
It's jammed. we will open it.

547
00:44:04.083 --> 00:44:09.958
Jammed? Alright. open it so that aunty
Clara can come clean the room.

548
00:44:10.083 --> 00:44:11.833
- Aunty Clara!
- Grandma don't worry.

549
00:44:11.833 --> 00:44:13.166
we will clean it ourselves.

550
00:44:13.166 --> 00:44:16.083
- Really?
- Yes granny.

551
00:44:16.083 --> 00:44:20.333
Ahh. good children.
I will be going out now.

552
00:44:20.458 --> 00:44:24.125
- Aunty Clara will take care of you okay?
- Okay granny.

553
00:44:24.166 --> 00:44:26.583
- Bye.
- There is a special open market

554
00:44:26.583 --> 00:44:29.500
this evening. when I come
back. we will go together.

555
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:33.541
- Okay.
- Alright.

556
00:44:35.083 --> 00:44:37.333
That was close.

557
00:44:37.333 --> 00:44:41.541
What. shouldn't we
tell mum? Or grandma?

558
00:44:41.541 --> 00:44:43.958
No! Never. never ever!

559
00:44:43.958 --> 00:44:45.750
Do you know what they
would do if they find out?

560
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.416
- Call the police?
- No. you know old people.

561
00:44:48.416 --> 00:44:50.708
they will scream everywhere.
they will tell the neighbours

562
00:44:50.708 --> 00:44:55.250
All the villagers will come here and
you know what they would do next?

563
00:44:55.333 --> 00:44:58.333
They will torture him to death.

564
00:45:01.958 --> 00:45:04.958
So what should we do now?

565
00:45:18.166 --> 00:45:20.208
We have to get rid of it.

566
00:45:20.208 --> 00:45:22.875
No! We just need to take him back home.

567
00:45:22.916 --> 00:45:26.666
- What! What if it's a carnivore?
- He is not.

568
00:45:26.666 --> 00:45:29.916
- How do you know?
- I don't but like...

569
00:45:29.916 --> 00:45:32.916
What if?

570
00:45:37.416 --> 00:45:42.375
- Yep! We have to tell mum
- No...

571
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.541
Mikolo!

572
00:45:50.958 --> 00:45:52.500
Mikolo!

573
00:45:55.333 --> 00:45:58.333
Oh no...

574
00:46:03.041 --> 00:46:07.708
Come down.. Come down...
Someone might see us.

575
00:46:08.958 --> 00:46:11.500
Hold on. I think...

576
00:46:19.625 --> 00:46:21.916
Mikolo. do you want this?

577
00:46:22.166 --> 00:46:25.166
Hey boy! Do you want some sweets?

578
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:38.333
Oh. my God! Oh my God.

579
00:46:42.291 --> 00:46:45.291
Eww...

580
00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:00.750
Oh my God. oh my God.

581
00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:11.041
Carnivore! He is going to eat us.

582
00:47:11.708 --> 00:47:13.916
Oh my god. I am
too smart to die.

583
00:47:13.916 --> 00:47:16.916
I have not even gotten
my nobel prize yet!

584
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:19.791
What if he has diseases?

585
00:47:19.791 --> 00:47:23.208
Like rabies. or ebola

586
00:47:23.375 --> 00:47:26.000
or even the corona
virus. it's still out there.

587
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.958
Funke you are not
listening to me.

588
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Don't shut me... That's...

589
00:47:32.208 --> 00:47:35.208
Mikolo!

590
00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.750
Spit him out!

591
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:41.500
Now!

592
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.916
Carnivore..

593
00:47:45.916 --> 00:47:48.458
Yup!

594
00:47:56.291 --> 00:47:57.208
How do we feed him?

595
00:47:57.208 --> 00:47:59.708
- I...
- Take it back to the cliff.

596
00:47:59.708 --> 00:48:04.041
We can't even leave it here.
grandma will be back soon.

597
00:48:04.041 --> 00:48:07.041
I know but then she'd
go to the market.

598
00:48:07.375 --> 00:48:11.833
- Wait! we can go to the market.
- What did you say?

599
00:48:11.833 --> 00:48:14.541
Yes. we can go and try
to find something he loves.

600
00:48:14.541 --> 00:48:16.041
- No.
- Yes.

601
00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:18.291
-No
-Ye...

602
00:48:18.291 --> 00:48:21.125
- Why are you making him to dissappear?
- I don't know?

603
00:48:22.416 --> 00:48:24.291
Just keep it quite.

604
00:48:24.291 --> 00:48:27.250
- We are coming!
- We are coming!

605
00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:31.458
Hello.

606
00:48:31.458 --> 00:48:33.583
Grandma said I should put this in the kitchen.

607
00:48:33.583 --> 00:48:34.708
No don't worry I'll take it.

608
00:48:34.708 --> 00:48:36.083
- It's heavy.
- No...

609
00:48:36.083 --> 00:48:38.541
- Let me carry it for you.
- Habeeb. Habeeb will help me.

610
00:48:38.541 --> 00:48:41.333
Habeeb come.. come here.

611
00:48:41.333 --> 00:48:42.875
If you need anything.
I would be at the shop.

612
00:48:42.875 --> 00:48:47.333
Okay. Bye..

613
00:49:10.833 --> 00:49:13.833
- Are you thinking what I am thinking?
- Of course!

614
00:49:30.458 --> 00:49:36.125
Funke! Habeeb! Get dressed grandma is waiting.

615
00:49:36.916 --> 00:49:39.375
Okay Aunty Clara.

616
00:49:44.916 --> 00:49:50.250
- This is a very bad idea
- Better don't tell anyone.

617
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.250
or else. I will change
your ipad password.

618
00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:56.750
- You don't know my ipad password
- Yes I do.

619
00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:02.875
BigHab1b. capital letter 'B'.

620
00:50:09.083 --> 00:50:14.166
So... You want to buy a bucket full of meat.

621
00:50:15.125 --> 00:50:17.583
- Umm..

622
00:50:17.583 --> 00:50:21.750
Well. we umm... Habeeb

623
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:24.458
Habeeb wants to draw them.

624
00:50:26.208 --> 00:50:31.291
Draw? So you want to waste a
whole bucket of meat because

625
00:50:31.291 --> 00:50:33.541
Habeeb wants to draw them?

626
00:50:33.541 --> 00:50:36.125
Then we can get fish
instead.. Big fishes.

627
00:50:36.125 --> 00:50:38.333
lots of them.

628
00:50:38.333 --> 00:50:41.333

636
00:51:22.833 --> 00:51:26.125
{Yoruba}- Please prepare this for us.
we will come back and get it.

637
00:51:26.291 --> 00:51:29.541
Funke! Don't you
want the fish again?

638
00:51:29.541 --> 00:51:32.541
I do.

639
00:51:32.875 --> 00:51:37.375
- Come. what's in that bag?
- Nothing.

640
00:51:42.041 --> 00:51:43.666
{Yoruba}- What is inside that bag?

641
00:51:43.666 --> 00:51:47.458
Habeeb. come here. Is

642
00:51:48.166 --> 00:51:51.166
{Yoruba}- What's happening with these children?

643
00:51:51.166 --> 00:51:54.166
Funke!

644
00:51:56.125 --> 00:51:59.125
What is wrong with children?

645
00:52:02.791 --> 00:52:06.916
Mikolo! Stop.

646
00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:12.375
Mikolo!

647
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.125
- Oh my god.
- Mikolo. Carnivore.

648
00:52:22.958 --> 00:52:28.083
No. Stop. stop. He's
not dangerous guys. stop.

649
00:52:29.791 --> 00:52:32.791
Leave him alone..

650
00:52:34.625 --> 00:52:37.625
Mikolo!

651
00:53:42.541 --> 00:53:43.750
- Grandma is awake
- Where am I?

652
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:46.000
Clara. Clara. bring water for grandma.

653
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:46.416
Grandma please stay calm.

654
00:53:46.416 --> 00:53:47.916
Where are my grand children?

655
00:53:47.916 --> 00:53:49.958
That thing carried Funke away.

656
00:53:49.958 --> 00:53:52.916
What took Funke?

657
00:53:52.916 --> 00:53:55.916
- What about Habeeb?
- Habeeb is in his room.

658
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:58.000
I'm in serious trouble.
What took Funke away?

659
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.791
Habeeb. Habeeb.

660
00:54:00.791 --> 00:54:05.958
Wait! If you could fly this high. why
didn't you just fly home?

661
00:54:08.416 --> 00:54:11.416
Did you do something
bad and run away?

662
00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:17.458
I knew it! You are naughty boy.
and you ran away from home.

663
00:54:17.458 --> 00:54:20.458
right?

664
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.583
Never do that again.

665
00:54:35.875 --> 00:54:40.250
Habeeb. where is that thing? And for
how long have you people had it?

666
00:54:40.791 --> 00:54:43.791
I'm talking to you? What
has it done to my Funke?

667
00:54:45.208 --> 00:54:51.041
Grandma. it's not dangerous.
We just found it lost at the cliff.

668
00:54:55.875 --> 00:54:56.875
I know how you feel.

669
00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:00.791
Sometimes I just want to leave
home and explore the world.

670
00:55:00.791 --> 00:55:05.041
You know. There's so much to see. Adventure
is really out there.

671
00:55:07.708 --> 00:55:10.708
But my mum gets worried a lot.

672
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.625
My Dad is the explorer.
He would have loved to meet you.

673
00:55:20.333 --> 00:55:23.791
I don't know what happened to them.
we used to travel together alot.

674
00:55:23.875 --> 00:55:26.875
and have lots of fun.

675
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:35.125
How about you. how are your parents?
Do you even have parents?

676
00:55:38.291 --> 00:55:41.291
Are there others like you?

677
00:55:49.708 --> 00:55:52.708
I think we should start going home.

678
00:55:58.458 --> 00:56:02.750
It's always hungry! It spoilt the tablet.
He even tried eating Tanko.

679
00:56:02.916 --> 00:56:03.416
- Really?
- Look

680
00:56:06.583 --> 00:56:11.833
- Where? What is it?
- Whoa! He doesn't appear in photos.

681
00:56:24.791 --> 00:56:27.791
{Yoruba}- Good evewning Ma.

682
00:56:35.875 --> 00:56:36.208
Good!

683
00:56:36.208 --> 00:56:39.208
{Yoruba}- Lock the door and come in here.

684
00:56:39.416 --> 00:56:42.125
Come in and close that door for me.

685
00:56:42.125 --> 00:56:43.708
{Yoruba}- Didn't you hear me?

686
00:56:43.708 --> 00:56:46.958
Close the door!

687
00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:57.958
Jesus!!!!

688
00:57:05.666 --> 00:57:08.291
So where is that thing?

689
00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:13.708
- Grandma. I can explain.
- Funke if you dare lie to me.

690
00:57:14.166 --> 00:57:17.791
I'm going to spank you.
So tell me where is it now?

691
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.166
Grandma. he was just scared.
he is not harmful. I promise!

692
00:57:21.416 --> 00:57:24.000
He is not harmful? That
strange looking thing?

693
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.375
Where is it? Tell me.

694
00:57:26.375 --> 00:57:29.375
{Yoruba}- Where is it?

695
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:37.541
Where is it?

696
00:57:42.291 --> 00:57:45.291
Mikolo.

697
00:57:46.958 --> 00:57:49.541
Blood of Jesus!

698
00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:02.125
- Jesus...
-No.. No. Stand back. get away.

699
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.916
{Yoruba}- Funke. come here now!

700
00:58:03.916 --> 00:58:10.500
Grandma tell him to leave. Get out!
What are you doing here? leave!

701
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:15.958
Leave Mikolo alone. I won't let you have him. Leave!

702
00:58:16.583 --> 00:58:19.583
- What have you done?
- Jesus!

703
00:58:19.916 --> 00:58:24.333
Leave him alone.
Leave him!

704
00:58:24.875 --> 00:58:28.000
- Funke I said come back here.
- He's not yours. drop him!

705
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.958
You are going to hurt him!

706
00:58:31.958 --> 00:58:33.208
Drop him and leave!

707
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:35.416
- Funke!
- Habeeb what are you doing?

708
00:58:35.416 --> 00:58:39.583
Leave him alone. Leave him!

709
00:58:40.583 --> 00:58:43.583
{Yoruba}- What's happening?
what's going on?

710
00:58:46.958 --> 00:58:50.375
- No... He's leaving!
- Come back here.

711
00:58:50.625 --> 00:58:53.625
No! Grandma get him!

712
00:58:54.916 --> 00:58:57.916
No! It's Mikolo.

713
00:59:02.958 --> 00:59:04.166
(Thug) - Who is this?

714
00:59:04.166 --> 00:59:07.000
Give us that animal.
don't make us hurt you.

715
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000
What is he doing?

716
00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:17.250
Give us that animal now.

717
01:00:21.666 --> 01:00:26.791
{Yoruba}- Don't let him leave.
Follow him.

718
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:41.041
Habeeb! You will come
and sleep in my room tonight.

719
01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:44.541
Leave Funke be.
okay. Let her be.

720
01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:48.750
Funke. your mother wants to speak with you.

721
01:00:54.625 --> 01:00:57.625
Hello. Funke.

722
01:00:59.958 --> 01:01:02.958
Funke. Pick up that phone
I want to see your face.

723
01:01:04.125 --> 01:01:07.125
Let me see your face.

724
01:01:10.916 --> 01:01:14.583
Funke. What have I told you about
this reckless behaviour?

725
01:01:14.666 --> 01:01:19.375
Oh Mummy! It was real.
There're real creatures out there.

726
01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:22.458
It found us. we were
just trying to take it home.

727
01:01:22.458 --> 01:01:26.416
What nonsense strange
creature? Where is the proof?

728
01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:29.416
Because Habeeb couldn't
show me any photos.

729
01:01:29.666 --> 01:01:31.500
Yes. but that's...

730
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:32.708
Will you keep quite
while I'm talking to you!

731
01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:34.041
I'm sorry.

732
01:01:34.041 --> 01:01:35.958
For God sake Funke!

733
01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:38.291
Why did you do this to me?

734
01:01:38.791 --> 01:01:41.583
I can't catch a break with you.

735
01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:44.458
You were supposed to be
mature and watch your brother.

736
01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:50.083
But no. you don't care.
All you care about is yourself.

737
01:01:50.083 --> 01:01:52.250
And that is a very selfish
behaviour. you know that.

738
01:01:52.583 --> 01:01:55.583
You care about only yourself and
your silly strange creatures.

739
01:01:55.791 --> 01:01:58.791
That's enough. you've scolded her enough.

740
01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:02.291
Everything is over now.

741
01:02:02.291 --> 01:02:05.291
Don't be so angry. she's just a child.

742
01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:07.958
Yes.

743
01:02:24.416 --> 01:02:27.416
- Is this bush meat?
- It seems like it's bush meat.

744
01:02:52.916 --> 01:02:55.916
Funke.

745
01:02:59.875 --> 01:03:02.875
I now believe in impossible things.

746
01:03:03.416 --> 01:03:06.416
Let's find Mikolo.

747
01:03:13.583 --> 01:03:16.375
I love you so much.

748
01:03:17.875 --> 01:03:21.541
You're the best brother
in the whole wide world.

749
01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:35.833
- But no. I can't drive a tricycle.
- You can. you still have one at home.

750
01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:39.333
- No. That was my 7th birthday gift
- It's the same thing.

751
01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.083
No. it's not. This is a machine.

752
01:03:42.083 --> 01:03:46.250
- Where did you even get the keys?
- It's an internal combustion engine.

753
01:03:46.375 --> 01:03:50.041
You know. like a car or a generator.

754
01:03:50.041 --> 01:03:55.125
And besides. this tricycle
belongs to grandma. Let's drive.

755
01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:03.916
- I said press the throttle
- That's what I'm doing.

756
01:04:03.916 --> 01:04:06.916
- No you're not.
- Yes I am.

757
01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:11.750
And you said this would
be easy peezy anyway.

758
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:15.291
Come on. it is easy peezy.
You're not just listening to me.

759
01:04:15.291 --> 01:04:18.750
- Just press that throttle.
- That's what I'm doing.

760
01:04:19.125 --> 01:04:24.958
- We will get caught.
- I think I've figured it out.

761
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:34.291
- You'll get us killed..
- What! I can't hear you.

762
01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:38.708
- I said you would get us killed.
- This is so much fun.

763
01:04:39.083 --> 01:04:43.416
- Funke. you're terrible driver!
- I'm the best driver in the whole world.

764
01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:47.708
- Oh my God. you're going the wrong way.
- What?

765
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.875
- I said you're going the wrong way.
- We're going to go get Mikolo.

766
01:04:53.708 --> 01:04:55.958
Oh my God!

767
01:04:59.125 --> 01:05:02.125
Stop the...tricycle!

768
01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:08.333
- What?
- He's not on the cliff.

769
01:05:09.458 --> 01:05:10.375
Huh!

770
01:05:10.625 --> 01:05:14.583
I've been trying to tell you this. they
did not make it to the irumole forest.

771
01:05:15.416 --> 01:05:18.416
- How do you know that?
- Look.

772
01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:22.875
- What is that?
- You don't know what this is?

773
01:05:23.375 --> 01:05:24.833
GPS!

774
01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:28.291
- It shows you where you are on earth.
- I know what GPS is.

775
01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:32.125
- What is that?
- That? That's from my watch.

776
01:05:33.208 --> 01:05:36.708
The one daddy bought for me. It's
very special that it let's him know

777
01:05:36.708 --> 01:05:38.958
everywhere we are.

778
01:05:38.958 --> 01:05:42.083
- Oh my God!
- I know right? It's so cool.

779
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:45.250
No.. It's not cool. Does
mum know about this?

780
01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:47.916
This is very bad. you know they
are fighting right? Oh my God!

781
01:05:47.916 --> 01:05:49.666
Everything is going to get much worse.

782
01:05:49.666 --> 01:05:54.833
Funke..Funke..Funke..Funke.
Don't even go there. Calm down.

783
01:05:55.916 --> 01:06:00.208
I put my watch in my bag before
giving it to that strange man.

784
01:06:05.416 --> 01:06:08.416
There are probably on this surulere street.

785
01:06:11.041 --> 01:06:14.041
Oh my goodness that evil man
is probably trying to eat him.

786
01:06:14.083 --> 01:06:15.916
- I know.
- Poor Mikolo.

787
01:06:15.916 --> 01:06:18.916
Alright. let's go.

788
01:06:19.333 --> 01:06:24.208
I'd be tracking but
slow down. don't kill me.

789
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:31.500
Just calm down.

790
01:06:32.875 --> 01:06:35.875
Alright. turn. Turn.

791
01:06:53.166 --> 01:06:56.166
So.... What's the plan?

792
01:06:58.458 --> 01:07:01.458
We don't have a plan?

793
01:07:03.458 --> 01:07:05.916
This is a bad idea.
We're going to get into trouble.

794
01:07:05.916 --> 01:07:09.583
- Shut up and stop being such a baby.
- But I am a baby.

795
01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:17.875
Come on.

796
01:07:28.291 --> 01:07:31.291
You have to distract them
so I can go get Mikolo.

797
01:07:31.375 --> 01:07:34.125
- How?
- I don't know.

798
01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:35.500
Aren't you a genius?

799
01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.958
- I am but...
- Just go!

800
01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:57.500
Goal!!!

801
01:08:22.583 --> 01:08:24.708
Mikolo.

802
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:30.291
Mikolo.

803
01:08:59.375 --> 01:09:02.958
{Yoruba}- Where did Habeeb go?

804
01:09:02.958 --> 01:09:05.958
Has he gone to sleep
in his sister's room?

805
01:09:10.208 --> 01:09:13.208
Habeeb...

806
01:09:15.083 --> 01:09:17.916
Funke!

807
01:09:18.833 --> 01:09:22.166
Habeeb!

808
01:09:22.166 --> 01:09:28.833
{Yoruba}- I'm in trouble! Where
are these children. Habeeb!

809
01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:32.166
Funke!

810
01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:37.791
Funke1

811
01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:42.250
Mikolo.

812
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Come on let's go see the football match.

813
01:10:13.708 --> 01:10:17.041
Mikolo.. You're alive!

814
01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:25.333
Oh!!!

815
01:10:31.583 --> 01:10:34.583
Habeeb...

816
01:10:35.666 --> 01:10:38.083
Mikolo.

817
01:10:38.083 --> 01:10:40.583
- Is the generator not coming on?
- Stop shouting at me.

818
01:10:40.583 --> 01:10:43.583
the generator isn't coming on.

819
01:11:15.041 --> 01:11:18.041
It serves you right!

820
01:11:19.625 --> 01:11:22.625
Where's Mikolo?

821
01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:29.125
What have you done
to him? Where's he?

822
01:11:30.291 --> 01:11:33.291
Answer me!

823
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:51.541
{Yoruba}- Pick up. pick up.

824
01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:53.125
Hello. Bose's mother.

825
01:11:53.125 --> 01:11:56.125
I'm sorry. but are
my grandchildren with you?

826
01:11:57.333 --> 01:12:00.416
They are not with you? Thank you.

827
01:12:02.083 --> 01:12:05.083
Who else do I call?... Jay-Jay.

828
01:12:11.041 --> 01:12:14.583
Goal!!!

829
01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:28.208

830
01:12:31.791 --> 01:12:37.875
Hold on okay..
Hold on I'm trying.

831
01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:42.666
Mikolo. Hold on. I'm
getting you out of here.

832
01:12:42.666 --> 01:12:45.666
I'm trying okay. I'm trying.

01:12:47.791 --> 01:12:50.791
Hold on.

Please take this girl out of here.
Take her out of here please.

835
01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:59.250
Leave me alone!

836
01:13:03.416 --> 01:13:06.416
Go on.

837
01:13:12.958 --> 01:13:15.750
Hold on.

838
01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:25.750
Mikolo! Stay back.

839
01:13:27.291 --> 01:13:32.666

01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:37.625
Mikolo we have to leave.
Stand back.

841
01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:30.958
You're the Abula? Protector
of the Irumole forest creatures.

842
01:14:49.208 --> 01:14:52.208
Mikolo!

843
01:14:55.541 --> 01:15:01.333

Alright. time to go.

848
01:15:59.208 --> 01:16:01.291
Oh my God.

849
01:16:01.291 --> 01:16:06.166
Ah! Get off the car Funke. it's the crazy man.

850
01:16:06.166 --> 01:16:08.250
- It's the Abula.
- The what?

851
01:16:08.333 --> 01:16:11.208

854
01:16:17.958 --> 01:16:20.958
- But they are coming.
- Oh my God!

855
01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:29.916
Come on. start the tricycle!

856
01:16:30.291 --> 01:16:31.875
Why didn't you just
leave your ipad for them?

857
01:16:31.875 --> 01:16:33.458
What? no way.

858
01:16:33.458 --> 01:16:35.958
Argh!

859
01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:39.958
Oh my God! It's not working.

860
01:16:40.916 --> 01:16:44.583
- Mikolo..Grrrr...
- Grrrr

861
01:16:44.583 --> 01:16:48.000
Come on...

Let's go.

866
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:52.208
- Tell Mikolo to help us go faster.
- No. he's tired.

867
01:17:52.208 --> 01:17:55.125
- Oh no!!!
- What?

868
01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:58.000
- Brakes are not working anymore.
- Push harder.

869
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.625
Come on Habeeb.

870
01:18:03.833 --> 01:18:12.208
- Ah!
- Oh my God! Mikolo!

871
01:18:24.958 --> 01:18:27.958
Come on Mikolo.
go faster. hurry up!

872
01:18:30.666 --> 01:18:33.666
Are we almost there?

873
01:19:03.666 --> 01:19:11.541
Please go. go.
go. go. Get down.

874
01:19:43.125 --> 01:19:46.125
Hello mother.

875
01:19:48.833 --> 01:19:50.291
Mikolo!

876
01:19:50.291 --> 01:19:53.083
- Move. move. move.
- Hurry up we need to go Mikolo.

877
01:19:53.083 --> 01:19:55.750
I know you're tired
but we have to go.

878
01:19:57.791 --> 01:20:00.791
Keep going Mikolo.

879
01:20:07.291 --> 01:20:10.291
Hurry up!

880
01:20:26.708 --> 01:20:31.125
- What's he doing?
- I think he's calling to his parents

881
01:20:35.458 --> 01:20:40.083
- What now?
- We wait.

882
01:21:17.875 --> 01:21:21.875
- What's happening to Mikolo?
- I think he's using all his energy.

883
01:21:21.875 --> 01:21:24.125
to build the bridge.

884
01:21:24.125 --> 01:21:28.333
This is beautiful.
This is impossible!

885
01:21:28.375 --> 01:21:32.625
(Chuckles.. ) Strange..
Magical.. Creatures.

886
01:21:33.583 --> 01:21:36.583
I now believe..

887
01:21:58.416 --> 01:22:01.416
Habeeb come come.
let's go. Come on!

888
01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:07.458
Go Mikolo.

889
01:22:31.583 --> 01:22:33.541
- Habeeb walk fast!
- You're holding me.

890
01:22:33.541 --> 01:22:36.125
so how can I walk fast?

891
01:22:54.625 --> 01:22:57.625
Mikolo!!!

892
01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.916
- Umm... Funke.
- What?

893
01:23:15.916 --> 01:23:19.916
- You want to see this?
- Oh my God. Oh my God.

894
01:25:46.916 --> 01:25:48.708
{Yoruba}- Mother!
- Yes?

895
01:25:48.708 --> 01:25:50.875
I have been calling you but haven't
been picking my calls.

896
01:25:51.125 --> 01:25:54.125
I'm sorry. My phone ran out of power.

897
01:25:54.333 --> 01:25:55.708
Where are my children?

898
01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:58.125
We have been searching
for them since last night.

899
01:25:58.125 --> 01:26:01.000
Infact I have not slept a wink.

900
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.375
- Officer
- Madam. calm down!!

901
01:26:02.375 --> 01:26:05.041
There's already a search
party out for your children.

902
01:26:05.041 --> 01:26:10.458
{Yoruba}- Please go get
updates from them. Thank you.

903
01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:13.666
My children? Gone missing in one day?

904
01:26:13.666 --> 01:26:20.083
It's okay my dear. The head
hunter has sent all his men.

905
01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:24.083
Since last night. they have
been looking everywhere

906
01:26:24.083 --> 01:26:27.083
around the mountain. searching..

907
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:31.583
I don't know. Nothing
will happen to them.

908
01:26:31.583 --> 01:26:36.333
And I don't know what that strange
creature has done to the children.

909
01:26:37.291 --> 01:26:39.666
Strange creature?

910
01:26:39.666 --> 01:26:45.041
{Yoruba}- Lola. I'm sorry.
I didn't want to tell you.

911
01:26:46.125 --> 01:26:50.083
The strange creature. It came
home with them the other time.

912
01:26:51.125 --> 01:26:57.250
You cannot even place it. It doesn't look
like an animal. you can't call it a bird.

913
01:26:57.250 --> 01:27:00.250
Neither can you call it a... I don't know.

914
01:27:01.166 --> 01:27:06.791
And the strangest thing. is that when
you take a picture of the creature.

915
01:27:07.541 --> 01:27:10.916
it dissappears. It dissappears.

916
01:27:11.166 --> 01:27:14.583
{Yoruba}- All my years on earth.
I have never seen anything like it.

917
01:27:14.583 --> 01:27:18.625
I've never seen such a
thing before in my life.

918
01:27:20.458 --> 01:27:23.458
It doesn't appear in pictures.

919
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.625
My daughter. Please
don't cry my daughter.

920
01:27:48.708 --> 01:27:50.208
- Mother.
- Yes?

921
01:27:50.208 --> 01:27:54.666
She told me everything. She told
me everything. I did not believe her.

922
01:27:54.666 --> 01:27:59.375
I shouted at her. My mother.
I'm a terrible mother.

923
01:27:59.375 --> 01:28:01.916
Omolola don't blame yourself!

924
01:28:01.916 --> 01:28:04.333
Let me tell you some
thing. we will find them.

925
01:28:04.333 --> 01:28:08.958
No weapon fashioned against
my grandchildren shall prosper.

926
01:28:08.958 --> 01:28:16.208
We are going to find them. and I've
never seen such a brave child as my Funke.

927
01:28:16.375 --> 01:28:22.166
Sorry. we will find
them by god's grace.

928
01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:29.375
Ah! My Son. Thank you for coming.

929
01:28:29.375 --> 01:28:33.458
Welcome! Thank you my
son. It shall be well with you.

930
01:28:33.458 --> 01:28:39.041
Thank you so much. Look at her.
I can't stop her from crying.

931
01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.500
Please. console her.

932
01:28:48.875 --> 01:28:52.041
I'm a terrible mother.

933
01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:56.875
I shouted at my baby and
she was right the whole time.

934
01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:14.250
It's okay... Everything will be fine.

935
01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:17.500
I'm here now. I'm
not going anywhere.

936
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:25.250
And please don't say that. you're upset
but you're not. You're a fantastic mum.

937
01:29:26.083 --> 01:29:30.416
Okay. I'm the one who's terrible.
I'm sorry okay but we will find them.

938
01:29:30.416 --> 01:29:35.958
I promise you. We will
find them. I promise we will.

939
01:29:37.833 --> 01:29:39.708
- They've not found them?
- Not yet. but we're looking everywhere.

940
01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:41.541
Head Hunter. thank you.

941
01:29:41.541 --> 01:29:41.916
We've not found them yet.

942
01:29:41.916 --> 01:29:45.958
- Any luck?
- They were sited with a funny looking man

943
01:29:45.958 --> 01:29:48.541
in a tricycle last night.

944
01:29:48.708 --> 01:29:50.125
They saw them with him.

945
01:29:50.125 --> 01:29:53.125
- And which way did they go?
- By the warm spring

946
01:29:54.250 --> 01:29:57.125
Alright. thank you.

947
01:29:57.125 --> 01:30:06.458
Malik! And you my darling. the Head
Hunter said some men spotted them

948
01:30:06.458 --> 01:30:09.875
inside a tricycle yesterday with a black man.

949
01:30:11.708 --> 01:30:14.708
- I think I know who the man is.
- Mother who?

950
01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:21.125
He was a strange looking man you
know. The man that came to pick

951
01:30:21.125 --> 01:30:25.958
the strange creature I described to you.

952
01:30:25.958 --> 01:30:29.625
He himself. you cannot
say he is a man or a boy.

953
01:30:29.666 --> 01:30:32.875
He's ... He has.. He has a...

954
01:30:33.625 --> 01:30:36.500
Does he have white
marks painted on his face?

955
01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:39.500
Yes. Yes.

956
01:30:40.458 --> 01:30:42.333
- Does he play flute?
- Flute?

957
01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:46.083
- Flute
- Yes. yes. When he wanted to...

958
01:30:47.333 --> 01:30:50.333
He played the flute.
He had a flute with him.

959
01:30:50.625 --> 01:30:51.833
Babablu...

960
01:30:51.833 --> 01:30:54.208
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

961
01:30:54.208 --> 01:30:56.833
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

962
01:30:56.833 --> 01:31:00.750
Okay. let's go... Olo-lo-lo..

963
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:03.041
- Olo-lo-lo..
- Bugawon

964
01:31:03.041 --> 01:31:05.416
- Olo-lo-lo..
- Bugawon

965
01:31:05.416 --> 01:31:09.416
O-lo-lo.... Olo-lo-lo..

966
01:31:09.416 --> 01:31:11.625
- Olo-lo-lo..
- Bugawon

967
01:31:11.625 --> 01:31:14.625
O-lo lo.... Sorry

968
01:31:15.458 --> 01:31:18.458
- Hello Babablu!
- Hello Madam.

969
01:31:18.583 --> 01:31:21.583
I came to your house.
I didn't see your car.

970
01:31:21.625 --> 01:31:24.083
- Babablu
- Madam

971
01:31:24.083 --> 01:31:26.625
Funke and Habeeb are gone!

972
01:31:26.625 --> 01:31:30.500
Gone where?
Where?

973
01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:33.250
They've found the creatures
you were talking about Babablu.

974
01:31:33.416 --> 01:31:37.000
And that man.

975
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.708
The Abula?

976
01:31:38.708 --> 01:31:41.291
I think so..

977
01:31:41.291 --> 01:31:44.958
Ah! Then they are safe.

978
01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:49.291
- He will protect them.
- But he's the protector of the spirits

979
01:31:49.291 --> 01:31:50.916
and not people.

980
01:31:50.916 --> 01:31:54.333
Hmmm. You have a point.

981
01:31:54.333 --> 01:31:59.000
So Babablu. what do we do?
How can we find this 'Irumole' forest ?

982
01:32:00.458 --> 01:32:03.083
We have to be sure they are there.

983
01:32:03.083 --> 01:32:08.083
No one can enter the Irumole forest.
without the permission from the trees.

984
01:32:10.083 --> 01:32:15.458
I.. I gave Funke an
amulet. that is the key.

985
01:32:15.458 --> 01:32:17.083
Find it!

986
01:32:17.083 --> 01:32:20.375
- What does it look like?
- Like a wooden coin.

987
01:32:20.375 --> 01:32:25.333
with a rope attached to it. You
should see the image of a creature

988
01:32:25.333 --> 01:32:28.333
on it. looks like a monkey.

989
01:32:40.291 --> 01:32:42.958
- I've found it!
- Good.

990
01:32:42.958 --> 01:32:46.000
So go. when you get to the cliff call me.

991
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.416
I'll tell you what to do.

992
01:32:48.416 --> 01:32:50.250
Okay. please keep
your phone close to you.

993
01:32:50.250 --> 01:32:52.416
I will don't worry.

994
01:32:52.416 --> 01:32:57.208
See. Funke is a warrior!
Habeeb is a genius!

995
01:32:57.958 --> 01:33:00.833
I'm sure they're out there. somewhere

996
01:33:00.833 --> 01:33:06.041
flying with 'Jankoriko' and then
rolling with 'blabalamama'.

997
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.708
Okay. thank. thank you Babablu.

998
01:33:09.708 --> 01:33:14.875
Wait! How do you even
know all these things?

999
01:33:28.208 --> 01:33:29.000
I think they made it into the forest.

1000
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
What? How do you know?

1001
01:33:32.583 --> 01:33:35.916
You're tracking them? How?
It's Habeeb's smart watch.

1002
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
The one you bought for him?

1003
01:33:40.291 --> 01:33:45.291
So you prefer to be tracking your children.
rather than coming here to stay with them

1004
01:33:45.291 --> 01:33:48.250
and protect them.

1005
01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:51.583
Lola... Look we can talk about
this later. but we need to go now!

1006
01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:04.500
But I said I was sorry.

1007
01:34:05.708 --> 01:34:11.750
You won't call. you will not return
my calls. my messages. Nothing!

1008
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:18.125
Sorry now. What else do you want me to say?

1009
01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.125
Is it that you think I
cannot handle the kids?

1010
01:34:21.125 --> 01:34:23.500
That you're tracking their
movement up and down.

1011
01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:26.375
Lola this thing was Habeeb's
idea from the start.

1012
01:34:26.458 --> 01:34:28.291
I didn't know I could track his watch.

1013
01:34:28.291 --> 01:34:30.541
And if my mother didn't call
you. you wouldn't have come.

1014
01:34:30.541 --> 01:34:35.583
No! I did not call him.
I did not call him.

1015
01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:45.500
How. How long have you been around?

1016
01:34:46.583 --> 01:34:51.458
I bought my flight ticket as soon as I
got off the phone after our argument.

1017
01:34:52.166 --> 01:34:56.166
I came to the house. I was calling
and calling. You didn't even answer.

1018
01:35:00.416 --> 01:35:03.416
Well it's your house as well.
you should have just knocked.

1019
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:05.541
Lola!

1020
01:35:07.833 --> 01:35:10.333
Lola!

1021
01:35:11.375 --> 01:35:15.916
I guess I just wanted to surprise
the kids that's why I showed up.

1022
01:35:16.791 --> 01:35:24.458
And then I called your mother. That's when she
told me you were here and broke the news to...

1023
01:35:24.458 --> 01:35:28.166
We are here! This is the place.

1024
01:35:28.666 --> 01:35:30.875
Funke!

1025
01:35:30.875 --> 01:35:33.583
Habeeb!

1026
01:35:33.583 --> 01:35:36.958
Funke! Habeeb!

1027
01:35:37.291 --> 01:35:41.083
Did you hear anything?

1028
01:35:41.708 --> 01:35:44.708
Funke!

1029
01:35:46.875 --> 01:35:48.166
Habeeb!

1030
01:35:48.166 --> 01:35:52.958
Lola what happened to you? You
used to really love adventures like this.

1031
01:35:53.041 --> 01:35:55.958
Well I got married to you.
I started having children.

1032
01:35:55.958 --> 01:35:58.958
- Funke!
- Don't you get it?

1033
01:35:59.208 --> 01:36:05.833
Funke is exactly like the old you.
Brave. adventurous. caring.

1034
01:36:05.833 --> 01:36:09.291
And Habeeb is just like the new you.
Keeping secrets from me.

1035
01:36:09.291 --> 01:36:12.291
and always focused on his computer.

1036
01:36:13.125 --> 01:36:14.750
Habeeb!

1037
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:16.375
Well. that's not entirely true.

1038
01:36:16.375 --> 01:36:18.250
{Yoruba}- That's enough both of you!

1039
01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:21.250
Both of you are just
behaving like your children.

1040
01:36:21.958 --> 01:36:26.041
See. I am tired. I can't go further. I will be here waiting.

1041
01:36:26.250 --> 01:36:29.000
Habeeb! Funke!

1042
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.208
- Habeeb!
- Funke!

1043
01:36:33.708 --> 01:36:37.125
- Babablu.
- Now. both of you.

1044
01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:40.041
knee down at the edge of the cliff.

1045
01:36:40.041 --> 01:36:43.041
Put the amulet down.

1046
01:36:43.958 --> 01:36:46.958
- Knee down?
- Yeah.

1047
01:36:50.875 --> 01:36:55.875
Now. hold each other's hands.

1048
01:36:56.166 --> 01:36:59.041
Okay. then what?

1049
01:36:59.041 --> 01:37:01.500
Now look into each other's eyes.

1050
01:37:01.541 --> 01:37:03.958
- Are you looking into each other's eyes?
- Yes!

1051
01:37:03.958 --> 01:37:05.333
Look into my eyes.

1052
01:37:05.333 --> 01:37:07.625
Okay and now what?

1053
01:37:07.625 --> 01:37:10.625
Give your husband a sweet kiss.

1054
01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:14.500
- Babablu!
- Oh yes. yes. yes.. The Amulet.

1055
01:37:14.958 --> 01:37:17.958
Touch the ground and repeat after me.

1056
01:37:20.541 --> 01:37:24.291
- Bangadulaga.
- Bangadulaga.

1057
01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:28.250
- Swanga zurangaga
- Swanga zurangaga

1058
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:31.250
- Zudanga zungaga
- Zudanga zungaga

1059
01:37:31.333 --> 01:37:36.416
- Zungangan zungangangan
- Zungangan zungangangan

1060
01:38:05.791 --> 01:38:09.833
Dont look down. Come.

1061
01:39:36.541 --> 01:39:39.333
And hence if you believe in
the impossible long enough.

1062
01:39:39.333 --> 01:39:42.291
they become possible.

1063
01:39:53.333 --> 01:39:55.916
Funke!

1064
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:58.625
- Funke!
- Habeeb!

1065
01:39:58.625 --> 01:40:01.625
Funke!

1066
01:40:02.083 --> 01:40:03.333
Habeeb!

1067
01:40:03.333 --> 01:40:06.333
Funke!

1068
01:40:07.666 --> 01:40:09.041
Habeeb!

1069
01:40:22.708 --> 01:40:25.708
Let's go.

1070
01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:34.500
- Funke.
- Habeeb

1071
01:40:35.333 --> 01:40:38.333
- Habeeb.
- Funke.

1072
01:40:39.041 --> 01:40:42.041
- Hey baby.
- Funke.

1073
01:40:44.541 --> 01:40:48.000
Funke. Funke!

1074
01:40:53.208 --> 01:41:00.791
Funke. I just came to say that I'm sorry.

1075
01:41:02.291 --> 01:41:06.500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for...

1076
01:41:07.041 --> 01:41:14.583
being too harsh on you. I'm
sorry for not believing in you.

1077
01:41:15.791 --> 01:41:19.791
I was just afraid. I was. I was afraid.

1078
01:41:20.333 --> 01:41:26.875
But now. now I believe.
I believe in the impossible.

1079
01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:35.041
And the two of you. you mean the
world. You mean the world to me.

1080
01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:47.416
Funke. please come back.
Habeeb! Your daddy is here come back.

1081
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:50.125

1082
01:41:50.291 --> 01:41:51.708
Hey!

1083
01:41:52.166 --> 01:42:00.250
My little warrior princess.

1084
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.500
Daddy is here.

1085
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.541
I'm sorry I haven't been around
enough. all that is going to change now.

1086
01:42:12.541 --> 01:42:15.541
Again here. and I'm
not going anywhere.
