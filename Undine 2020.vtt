3
00:01:02.742 --> 00:01:05.816
Would you like another drink?
A coffee?

4
00:01:06.376 --> 00:01:07.516
I'll get you one.

5
00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:09.441
Don't bother.

6
00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:25.675
You must have suspected something.

7
00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.483
"We have to meet".

8
00:01:30.242 --> 00:01:33.762
I always say "We have to see each other".
But this time...

9
00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:35.983
"We have to meet".

10
00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:40.108
"I have to see you".

11
00:01:43.242 --> 00:01:45.082
You said. "I have to see you".

12
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.570
It's on the voicemail. You can listen.

13
00:01:52.284 --> 00:01:53.649
Forget it. Undine.

14
00:01:56.284 --> 00:01:57.649
Fine. okay.

15
00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.191
I will have a coffee after all.

16
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.025
After that I have to go.

17
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.734
Was that her?

18
00:04:18.868 --> 00:04:20.776
I have to go now.

19
00:04:21.952 --> 00:04:24.151
You said you love me.

20
00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:27.151
For ever.

21
00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:32.192
- Undine. please.
- You can't go.

22
00:04:35.327 --> 00:04:37.737
If you leave me. I'll have to kill you.

23
00:04:39.827 --> 00:04:41.526
You know that.

24
00:04:47.202 --> 00:04:48.484
Stop this crap.

25
00:04:59.618 --> 00:05:00.734
Johannes?

26
00:05:01.623 --> 00:05:04.943
I'm going to work now.
I have a break in half an hour.

27
00:05:05.077 --> 00:05:06.776
then I'll come back.

28
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.650
You're going to wait here
and tell me that you still love me.

29
00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:18.568
If you leave. you have to die.
Do you understand?

30
00:05:21.202 --> 00:05:24.484
- Do you understand. Johannes?
- Yes.

31
00:06:21.994 --> 00:06:23.901
Morning. Ms Wibeau.

32
00:07:20.536 --> 00:07:21.652
Ms Wibeau!

33
00:07:22.286 --> 00:07:23.902
They're waiting for you.

34
00:08:03.787 --> 00:08:05.611
Hello. ladies and gentlemen.

35
00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:10.962
I welcome you on behalf of the Senator
for Urban Development and Housing.

36
00:08:11.162 --> 00:08:14.444
here at 3. Kollnische Strasse
in Berlin-Mitte.

37
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.561
My name is Undine Wibeau.

38
00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:21.694
I'm a historian and my job at the Senate
is to take care of national...

39
00:08:22.328 --> 00:08:23.936
and international guests.

40
00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:28.111
I was informed that you all have
a good command of German. so...

41
00:08:28.412 --> 00:08:31.902
if no one objects.
I will give my talk in German.

42
00:08:33.537 --> 00:08:35.686
So. let's begin. First of all.

43
00:08:35.787 --> 00:08:38.894
I'll give you some information
on the four models.

44
00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:43.194
The main attraction
is the model of Berlin dating from 1991.

45
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:47.653
After reunification in 1990.
construction efforts were focused

46
00:08:48.287 --> 00:08:52.736
on the former East Berlin inner city.
known as the "historic centre".

47
00:08:53.598 --> 00:08:57.728
To better assess the effects
of building projects on urban planning.

48
00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.228
this blueprint was created.

49
00:09:00.329 --> 00:09:04.486
The pre-1990 building stock
is presented here in white.

50
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.853
the brown buildings are those
that have been built since.

51
00:09:07.954 --> 00:09:12.653
and those with incomplete facades
are planned but have yet to be built.

52
00:09:13.454 --> 00:09:16.403
The GDR planning model on your right

53
00:09:17.037 --> 00:09:21.770
shows the city council's
building stock in East Berlin's centre

54
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:24.070
before 1989.

55
00:09:24.704 --> 00:09:27.645
It is. so to speak.
an idealized self-portrait

56
00:09:27.746 --> 00:09:30.978
of the socialist city
shortly before its collapse.

57
00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:35.445
The loving attention to detail
in the facades is remarkable.

58
00:09:35.621 --> 00:09:39.778
The coloured plastic gives this model
its East German charm.

59
00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:42.861
inasmuch as one might appreciate that.

60
00:09:43.355 --> 00:09:47.645
Unfortunately. part of the model is
on loan to a GDR nostalgia exhibit.

61
00:09:47.746 --> 00:09:50.728
As I'm sure you know.
the collapse of the GDR.

62
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:54.199
which some call a revolution.
has its 30th anniversary.

63
00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:56.436
The model will be complete in autumn.

64
00:09:56.537 --> 00:10:00.403
and it can only be seen here
in its entirety as a photograph.

65
00:10:01.954 --> 00:10:04.228
The model on the opposite wall

66
00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:07.820
extends the focus
to areas of the western inner city.

67
00:10:08.454 --> 00:10:11.134
The detailed presentation
of the courtyards

68
00:10:11.704 --> 00:10:13.978
provides a good insight

69
00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.353
into typical Wilhelmine
tenement housing in Berlin

70
00:10:17.454 --> 00:10:22.653
in the "Grunderzeit" era of the 1900s.
I'll return to that later in more detail.

71
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:27.778
The tactile model for our blind
or visually impaired visitors

72
00:10:28.413 --> 00:10:30.820
covers the largest area.

73
00:10:31.154 --> 00:10:34.062
None of the models here
come close to representing

74
00:10:34.163 --> 00:10:36.570
the full extent of Berlin.

75
00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:38.895
The tactile model

76
00:10:38.996 --> 00:10:42.816
doesn't even encompass the area
inside the S-Bahn train line.

77
00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:47.187
Due to its distinctive and
easily recognisable shape on the map.

78
00:10:47.288 --> 00:10:51.937
this area is called the "dog's head".
It covers an area of 90 square km.

79
00:10:52.038 --> 00:10:55.612
which makes up
about one tenth of Berlin's total area.

80
00:10:58.163 --> 00:11:01.187
The modern-day boundaries of Berlin

81
00:11:01.288 --> 00:11:05.229
can be traced back
to the Greater Berlin Act of 1920.

82
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.145
which consolidated Berlin
and its outlying towns and suburbs

83
00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:12.237
into a single administrative entity.

84
00:11:12.996 --> 00:11:16.487
We need not look far
to find Berlin's origins:

85
00:11:16.687 --> 00:11:19.229
They lie
just a few hundred metres downriver.

86
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.987
where the Muhlendamm Bridge
crosses the River Spree.

87
00:11:23.163 --> 00:11:25.362
Can any of you show us

88
00:11:25.538 --> 00:11:27.654
where we are right now?

89
00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:29.737
I can!

90
00:11:31.188 --> 00:11:32.484
Here.

91
00:11:47.872 --> 00:11:49.112
Am I right?

92
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.487
Yes.

93
00:11:52.706 --> 00:11:55.896
The exact date Berlin was founded
remains a mystery.

94
00:11:55.997 --> 00:12:00.854
but the first structures probably emerged
at the turn of the 13th century

95
00:12:00.955 --> 00:12:03.571
when traders built settlements here:

96
00:12:04.205 --> 00:12:07.437
One on the east side
with St. Nicholas' Church.

97
00:12:07.538 --> 00:12:10.821
the other on Colin Island
with St. Peter's Church.

98
00:12:10.997 --> 00:12:12.529
Why here?

99
00:12:12.913 --> 00:12:15.863
The name Berlin.
which is Slavic in origin.

100
00:12:16.164 --> 00:12:20.529
means "marsh"
or "dry place in the marsh".

101
00:13:30.164 --> 00:13:31.446
Johannes?

102
00:13:39.081 --> 00:13:40.238
Johannes?

103
00:14:01.873 --> 00:14:02.988
Undine!

104
00:14:20.623 --> 00:14:22.238
Excuse me?

105
00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:27.780
I just wanted to say
that your talk was great.

106
00:14:28.915 --> 00:14:31.985
I'm usually underwater.
I'm an industrial diver.

107
00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:36.572
I'm checking the bridges here.
and I came here for a coffee.

108
00:14:37.206 --> 00:14:39.072
I was thinking maybe...

109
00:14:39.706 --> 00:14:42.614
you'd like to have a coffee
during your break?

110
00:14:49.748 --> 00:14:52.072
Your phone's on the floor.

111
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.697
I'll get it for you. okay?

112
00:14:55.873 --> 00:15:00.239
I didn't want to impose.
it was a bit rude of me.

113
00:15:02.456 --> 00:15:04.364
No problem. I'll be off. then.

114
00:15:47.498 --> 00:15:49.156
Don't move!

115
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.864
Does it hurt?

116
00:16:00.999 --> 00:16:02.781
I'll pull it out. okay?

117
00:16:08.415 --> 00:16:10.031
Here's another one.

118
00:16:14.665 --> 00:16:16.531
It looks pretty deep.

119
00:16:19.165 --> 00:16:20.905
Is this an industrial diver?

120
00:16:34.249 --> 00:16:35.906
You assholes!

121
00:16:36.541 --> 00:16:39.740
Stupid assholes!
I hope you're well insured.

122
00:16:43.374 --> 00:16:45.240
I can't believe this!

123
00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:31.067
What was wrong?
We thought we might have to pull you up.

124
00:19:33.667 --> 00:19:34.817
I saw the catfish.

125
00:19:35.417 --> 00:19:36.824
The catfish?

126
00:19:36.959 --> 00:19:38.316
Yes.

127
00:19:38.417 --> 00:19:42.199
You mean THE catfish?
Big Gunther?

128
00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:55.908
So. how big is he? This big?

129
00:19:57.042 --> 00:19:59.074
This big? Or maybe this big?

130
00:19:59.209 --> 00:20:00.908
Hey. guys!

131
00:20:03.042 --> 00:20:04.866
Let's pack up.

132
00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:10.241
Well. I'd say at least two metres.

133
00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:12.575
I don't believe a word of it.

134
00:20:18.834 --> 00:20:22.524
I don't want to get stuck
at Kamener junction for two hours!

135
00:20:38.501 --> 00:20:39.783
Guys!

136
00:20:48.209 --> 00:20:50.700
- Did you record it?
- Why?

137
00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:52.950
- Did you?
- Of course.

138
00:20:55.584 --> 00:20:58.742
- Is something wrong?
- I want to see it.

139
00:20:59.376 --> 00:21:01.192
- He saw Gunther.
- Who?

140
00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:03.817
- Gunther. the catfish.
- Nonsense!

141
00:21:03.918 --> 00:21:06.200
Christoph is absolutely sure of it.

142
00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:09.908
- She doesn't believe me.
- I don't believe him.

143
00:21:10.043 --> 00:21:11.900
Watch it while we're driving.

144
00:21:12.001 --> 00:21:13.983
- Christoph isn’t coming.
- No?

145
00:21:14.084 --> 00:21:16.275
- He's not coming.
- He's staying here?

146
00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:18.825
- The whole weekend.
- What for?

147
00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:20.908
He's waiting for Undine.

148
00:21:22.043 --> 00:21:23.533
That's up to him.

149
00:21:24.709 --> 00:21:26.450
Oh. shit!

150
00:21:27.376 --> 00:21:30.075
- Gunther is really ugly.
- Yes. he is..

151
00:21:30.918 --> 00:21:32.783
Let's pack up.

152
00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:36.788
Come on.
I don't want to get stuck in traffic.

153
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.784
I messed up.

154
00:22:42.418 --> 00:22:43.451
How?

155
00:22:44.585 --> 00:22:45.742
The hotel.

156
00:22:47.877 --> 00:22:49.117
Did it explode?

157
00:22:50.752 --> 00:22:52.492
It's a pity it didn't.

158
00:22:55.168 --> 00:22:56.576
I see.

159
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.784
They took the stitches out.

160
00:23:26.419 --> 00:23:27.868
Did it hurt?

161
00:23:29.585 --> 00:23:31.401
- Keep going.
- Six stitches.

162
00:23:31.502 --> 00:23:32.993
Keep going!

163
00:23:46.127 --> 00:23:48.326
Now you can go in the water again.

164
00:27:48.587 --> 00:27:49.995
Undine!

165
00:28:26.129 --> 00:28:28.787
- Christoph!
- Spit it out! - That hurts.

166
00:28:29.463 --> 00:28:30.953
But you have to...

167
00:28:31.629 --> 00:28:33.245
I'm okay.

168
00:28:36.379 --> 00:28:39.578
I only let go for a second.
to show you something.

169
00:28:41.254 --> 00:28:43.620
Your name's written down there.

170
00:28:51.755 --> 00:28:53.329
What were you singing?

171
00:28:54.463 --> 00:28:56.120
Stayin' alive.

172
00:28:58.796 --> 00:29:00.245
We learned it.

173
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.120
Because of the rhythm.

174
00:29:11.338 --> 00:29:13.245
Can you revive me again?

175
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.204
What? Now?

176
00:29:16.838 --> 00:29:17.954
Please.

177
00:29:21.171 --> 00:29:23.162
If anyone sees us.

178
00:29:24.421 --> 00:29:27.287
- they'll think it's an emergency.
- Please!

179
00:29:30.422 --> 00:29:32.704
I can revive you at home.

180
00:30:45.839 --> 00:30:47.288
Why are you dressed?

181
00:30:47.547 --> 00:30:49.071
I have to get my train.

182
00:30:49.172 --> 00:30:51.538
Yes. I have to go too.

183
00:30:52.672 --> 00:30:56.080
- You can sleep some more. Christoph.
- No. wait a sec.

184
00:31:01.714 --> 00:31:03.413
Chop-chop!

185
00:31:05.631 --> 00:31:06.913
Come on.

186
00:31:28.047 --> 00:31:29.830
I didn't fall asleep.

187
00:31:30.464 --> 00:31:31.696
Yes. you did.

188
00:31:31.797 --> 00:31:34.621
- I just closed my eyes.
- You fell asleep!

189
00:31:35.756 --> 00:31:37.738
- Shut your eyes.
- Why?

190
00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:39.538
Close your eyes!

191
00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:42.438
How long have we been sitting here?

192
00:31:44.048 --> 00:31:45.372
Three minutes?

193
00:31:46.006 --> 00:31:47.955
Five minutes?

194
00:31:49.673 --> 00:31:51.538
I love you.

195
00:31:53.673 --> 00:31:55.497
Ten minutes?

196
00:31:56.631 --> 00:31:58.372
25 minutes.

197
00:32:19.506 --> 00:32:21.289
Your train's here.

198
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.997
This is for you.

199
00:33:04.673 --> 00:33:06.164
I'll call you!

200
00:33:06.298 --> 00:33:07.706
I'll call you!

201
00:34:14.999 --> 00:34:18.581
When plans to rebuild East Berlin
were presented in Moscow.

202
00:34:18.715 --> 00:34:22.031
they were categorically rejected
by political leaders there.

203
00:34:22.132 --> 00:34:25.823
The workers' apartments designed by
Scharoun's collective were too modest.

204
00:34:25.924 --> 00:34:29.156
the family homes with small gardens
were too bourgeois.

205
00:34:29.257 --> 00:34:31.448
the street layout was too provincial.

206
00:34:31.549 --> 00:34:35.156
They demanded a prestigious solution.
using Moscow as a model.

207
00:34:35.257 --> 00:34:40.073
that would express their grand ideas
for social change and progress.

208
00:34:40.174 --> 00:34:46.040
Architecture worthy of the significance
of Germany's socialist capital:

209
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:50.040
A city centre with large axes
and monumental buildings.

210
00:34:50.174 --> 00:34:54.406
not faceless. boxy. American-style
architecture with no sense of history.

211
00:34:54.507 --> 00:34:58.240
In short. an architecture
in keeping with national traditions.

212
00:34:58.341 --> 00:35:02.698
Just years after the war. hadn't the term
"national" been forever discredited

213
00:35:02.799 --> 00:35:04.956
by National Socialism?

214
00:35:05.132 --> 00:35:08.582
According to Soviet revolutionary theory:
certainly not.

215
00:35:12.883 --> 00:35:14.373
Undine?

216
00:35:17.008 --> 00:35:18.008
Undine?

217
00:35:26.216 --> 00:35:28.540
Undine. I'm sorry but...

218
00:35:28.674 --> 00:35:31.123
You were fast asleep. and...

219
00:35:31.758 --> 00:35:34.990
The group from Leverkusen
is coming at 11 tomorrow.

220
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:37.415
You'll do Humboldt Forum. okay?

221
00:35:38.049 --> 00:35:40.359
- Gloria's doing it.
- Gloria's sick.

222
00:35:41.458 --> 00:35:44.948
But I'd have to start from scratch!
Can't I do the Hobrecht-Plan?

223
00:35:45.049 --> 00:35:48.290
They want the forum.
Apparently they have a palace too.

224
00:35:48.424 --> 00:35:50.990
- and they have similar plans.
- How will I manage it?

225
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:54.391
You'll manage.
We need it in text form. unfortunately.

226
00:35:54.591 --> 00:35:58.082
- But I could use Gloria's text.
- We can't reach Gloria!

227
00:35:59.716 --> 00:36:02.665
Okay. see you tomorrow. And thanks.

228
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:18.250
Over the next three centuries the palace
was extended and altered several times...

229
00:36:20.675 --> 00:36:23.665
until the beginning
of the 18th century...

230
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.790
when it had more or less...

231
00:36:29.925 --> 00:36:33.665
reached its final form.

232
00:36:35.341 --> 00:36:36.790
The...

233
00:36:37.125 --> 00:36:41.741
The Berlin Palace was the largest Baroque
secular structure north of the Alps.

234
00:36:41.842 --> 00:36:44.416
with a floor area of nine hectares.

235
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.332
Nine hectares. and...

236
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:53.124
Nine hectares...
Nine hectares. and...

237
00:36:56.258 --> 00:36:59.874
Nine hectares and 1.200 rooms.

238
00:37:01.508 --> 00:37:03.207
Nine hectares...

239
00:37:06.883 --> 00:37:08.916
Nine hectares. 1.200 rooms...

240
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:12.624
It was difficult to heat
and disliked by its owners.

241
00:37:12.958 --> 00:37:16.324
The palace was initially located
at the western boundary of the city.

242
00:37:16.425 --> 00:37:19.241
As the city expanded westwards.
it shifted

243
00:37:19.342 --> 00:37:23.074
towards the city centre
and became the focal point of the city.

244
00:37:23.175 --> 00:37:27.699
forming the hub for the surrounding
buildings and the starting point

245
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:33.249
for the avenue named "Unter den Linden".
the Prussian "Via Triumphalis".

246
00:37:47.384 --> 00:37:48.791
Undine?

247
00:37:50.925 --> 00:37:52.583
Christoph?

248
00:38:22.301 --> 00:38:26.125
The control unit on turbine 2
is defective and...

249
00:38:34.459 --> 00:38:37.325
...the hub for the surrounding buildings
and the starting point

250
00:38:37.426 --> 00:38:41.796
for the avenue named "Unter den Linden".
the Prussian "Via Triumphalis".

251
00:38:42.259 --> 00:38:46.979
Thus the layout of the palace district.
with the Berlin Cathedral. Zeughaus...

252
00:38:48.676 --> 00:38:51.926
becomes evident with the palace
as a reference point.

253
00:38:52.437 --> 00:38:55.617
This aspect.
the revival of the city's lost centre.

254
00:38:55.718 --> 00:39:00.125
would later serve
as the key argument in the debate...

255
00:39:08.759 --> 00:39:10.458
It fell onto the floor.

256
00:39:11.134 --> 00:39:12.375
Yeah?

257
00:39:12.509 --> 00:39:15.375
The leg broke off.
but I glued it on again.

258
00:39:18.009 --> 00:39:19.833
I was so angry. I cried.

259
00:39:20.968 --> 00:39:23.498
I love this diver.
I was so upset that...

260
00:39:24.093 --> 00:39:25.750
that it fell down.

261
00:39:26.384 --> 00:39:28.375
You can't even notice it.

262
00:39:29.009 --> 00:39:30.959
You glued it really well.

263
00:39:34.718 --> 00:39:36.334
Are you practicing?

264
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:40.459
- I have to give a talk tomorrow.
- Really? What about?

265
00:39:40.593 --> 00:39:43.667
- The stupid Humboldt Forum.
- When? - At 11 a.m.

266
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:46.200
Oh. at 11. Okay.

267
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:48.334
I'll be at work by then.

268
00:39:50.093 --> 00:39:52.709
I'd have liked to hear it.

269
00:39:53.343 --> 00:39:55.334
I bet it's going to be great.

270
00:40:02.468 --> 00:40:03.792
I'm sorry.

271
00:40:03.926 --> 00:40:05.159
I'll fix it.

272
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.742
- What?
- I'll paint it.

273
00:40:06.843 --> 00:40:09.167
- Forget it.
- I'm a good painter.

274
00:40:13.427 --> 00:40:15.334
Screw the wall.

275
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:21.084
Wait a moment!

276
00:40:27.218 --> 00:40:29.042
Can you do your talk for me?

277
00:40:31.177 --> 00:40:32.417
What?

278
00:40:34.552 --> 00:40:35.792
Please?

279
00:40:36.927 --> 00:40:38.667
- Now?
- Yes.

280
00:40:41.302 --> 00:40:42.659
It's totally boring.

281
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.626
No. it isn't.
Not at all.

282
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.584
You say such clever things.

283
00:40:50.218 --> 00:40:53.167
So many clever things.
and in such a nice way.

284
00:41:03.802 --> 00:41:05.376
The palace

285
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:09.060
was initially located
at the western boundary of the city.

286
00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.868
As the city expanded westwards.
it shifted towards the city centre

287
00:41:12.969 --> 00:41:17.019
becoming the focal point of the city.
the hub for the surrounding buildings.

288
00:41:17.219 --> 00:41:20.076
and the starting point
for the avenue named "Unter den Linden".

289
00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:22.668
the Prussian "Via Triumphalis".

290
00:41:23.502 --> 00:41:26.368
The layout of the palace district.
with the Cathedral. Zeughaus.

291
00:41:26.469 --> 00:41:28.534
Lustgarten and Altes Museum

292
00:41:28.635 --> 00:41:32.076
only becomes evident
with the palace as a reference point.

293
00:41:32.177 --> 00:41:36.227
This aspect. the revival of the city's
lost centre. was the key argument

294
00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:39.793
for the reconstruction
of the city palace.

295
00:41:40.793 --> 00:41:43.793
In World War II
most of the palace was destroyed.

296
00:41:43.927 --> 00:41:46.910
although in the early post-war years.
some rooms

297
00:41:47.011 --> 00:41:49.751
were still used for exhibitions etc.

298
00:41:50.586 --> 00:41:53.243
If the GDR socialist party
had been interested.

299
00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:56.160
it certainly could have been rebuilt.

300
00:41:56.261 --> 00:42:00.835
as proven by the reconstruction
of Charlottenburg Palace in the West.

301
00:42:01.469 --> 00:42:04.410
But East Berlin's
urban development planners

302
00:42:04.511 --> 00:42:07.368
wanted to use the palace site
as a parade ground

303
00:42:07.469 --> 00:42:09.918
where. according to Walter Ulbricht.

304
00:42:10.752 --> 00:42:14.868
the people could express their will
to fight and rebuild their nation.

305
00:42:14.969 --> 00:42:17.493
So in autumn 1950.

306
00:42:17.594 --> 00:42:19.368
despite numerous protests.

307
00:42:19.469 --> 00:42:23.710
the ruins of the palace were demolished
because. as it was rumoured

308
00:42:23.928 --> 00:42:27.468
they couldn't demolish
both the cathedral and the palace.

309
00:42:29.094 --> 00:42:33.993
The empty space was partially filled by
the Palace of the Republic in the 1970s.

310
00:42:34.094 --> 00:42:38.710
but a gaping. almost surreal wasteland
remained in the centre of the city.

311
00:42:38.844 --> 00:42:41.043
at least to Western eyes.

312
00:42:41.261 --> 00:42:45.085
And one sensed the phantom pain
of a violent amputation.

313
00:42:48.719 --> 00:42:50.877
Can anyone maybe show me the spot

314
00:42:51.511 --> 00:42:53.377
where the palace once stood?

315
00:42:54.594 --> 00:42:56.752
- How about you?
- Me?

316
00:42:58.511 --> 00:43:00.001
Come on. I'll help you.

317
00:43:12.511 --> 00:43:14.627
Well? Have you got an idea?

318
00:43:25.761 --> 00:43:26.877
There!

319
00:43:28.511 --> 00:43:29.710
Not bad.

320
00:43:32.345 --> 00:43:35.327
After reunification.
a discussion soon developed

321
00:43:35.428 --> 00:43:38.702
about how to make use
of this space in the city centre.

322
00:43:38.803 --> 00:43:41.377
In 2002 the Bundestag voted to rebuild

323
00:43:41.511 --> 00:43:43.952
the palace
with a replica of the old facade.

324
00:43:44.053 --> 00:43:47.535
We owe the reconstruction of the palace
to a sleight of hand:

325
00:43:47.636 --> 00:43:51.494
In 1993 the association for the
reconstruction of the palace

326
00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:54.702
created a simulation of the palace facade

327
00:43:54.803 --> 00:43:59.836
to show Berlin residents what
they had lost in the heart of the city.

328
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:05.300
It was a success. The public supported
a historical reconstruction of the palace

329
00:44:05.845 --> 00:44:10.711
which would mainly serve as a museum
space under the name Humboldt Forum.

330
00:44:15.345 --> 00:44:18.044
Modern architectural theory teaches us

331
00:44:18.378 --> 00:44:20.911
that the design of a building
can be derived

332
00:44:21.012 --> 00:44:25.169
from the best possible realization
of its intended use

333
00:44:25.803 --> 00:44:27.419
Form follows function.

334
00:44:28.053 --> 00:44:30.411
In the centre of Berlin now stands

335
00:44:30.512 --> 00:44:33.461
a museum built in the 21st century...

336
00:44:35.095 --> 00:44:38.336
in the form
of an 18th-century ruler's palace.

337
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:44.244
The deceptive part lies in the hypothesis
that this makes no real difference.

338
00:44:44.345 --> 00:44:47.169
which is the same as claiming

339
00:44:47.804 --> 00:44:50.336
that progress is impossible.

340
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:54.378
Quite a statement.
even if one doesn't agree.

341
00:46:26.971 --> 00:46:28.462
Call me.

342
00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.129
- Do you have a moment?
- No.

343
00:47:18.763 --> 00:47:20.712
Your talk starts at 11.

344
00:47:21.721 --> 00:47:23.754
So you have a bit of time.

345
00:47:24.472 --> 00:47:25.921
The...

346
00:47:27.722 --> 00:47:30.462
The thing with Nora
was a huge mistake.

347
00:47:30.638 --> 00:47:32.462
I'm sorry.

348
00:47:35.222 --> 00:47:37.379
I'm going to split up with her.

349
00:47:40.638 --> 00:47:42.671
Johannes. I'm going now.

350
00:47:44.305 --> 00:47:46.171
Listen. when is your break?

351
00:47:46.805 --> 00:47:48.879
I'll wait in our cafe. okay?

352
00:47:50.138 --> 00:47:51.254
See you.

353
00:49:22.889 --> 00:49:24.663
Hello. ladies and gentlemen.

354
00:49:24.764 --> 00:49:28.981
I welcome you on behalf of the Senator
for Urban Development and Housing.

355
00:49:29.181 --> 00:49:32.713
here at 3. Kollnische Strasse
in Berlin-Mitte.

356
00:49:33.348 --> 00:49:36.088
My name is Undine Wibeau.
I'm a historian

357
00:49:36.223 --> 00:49:40.538
and my job at the Senate is to take care
of national and international guests.

358
00:49:40.639 --> 00:49:44.463
Over the next 30 minutes
I'd like to give you a cursory overview

359
00:49:44.598 --> 00:49:48.997
of some aspects of urban development in
Berlin with the help of the models here.

360
00:49:49.098 --> 00:49:51.955
Together we will take a special look

361
00:49:52.056 --> 00:49:54.463
at the history of Berlin Palace.

362
00:50:36.098 --> 00:50:39.255
I've never seen you
in your work clothes before.

363
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:42.830
You look great.

364
00:50:42.931 --> 00:50:44.505
Sexy.

365
00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.630
It suits you.
Come on.

366
00:50:47.765 --> 00:50:49.172
Sit down.

367
00:50:50.306 --> 00:50:51.714
Come on.

368
00:51:03.848 --> 00:51:05.808
Do you have to go straight back?

369
00:51:06.807 --> 00:51:10.672
You have time for a cappuccino. hm?
A cappuccino for the lady.

370
00:51:11.348 --> 00:51:13.756
She's not getting a cappuccino.

371
00:51:15.747 --> 00:51:18.297
- Pardon me?
- She's not getting anything.

372
00:51:18.432 --> 00:51:21.214
She's banned from here. and she knows it.

373
00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:25.256
You have three minutes to leave.

374
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:34.720
Did I miss something?

375
00:51:39.223 --> 00:51:40.223
Listen:

376
00:51:40.557 --> 00:51:44.714
I just called the "Bleiche"
and booked us that room.

377
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:47.849
Remember?

378
00:51:48.474 --> 00:51:51.006
The one overlooking the pond. Our room.

379
00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.631
The one you liked so much.

380
00:51:57.465 --> 00:51:59.789
I'll wait here. and when you're done.

381
00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:01.714
we'll drive straight there.

382
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:10.582
- Hello?
- Stayin' alive!

383
00:53:10.683 --> 00:53:12.123
What?

384
00:53:12.224 --> 00:53:14.548
- Hello?
- I'm listening to it.

385
00:53:14.977 --> 00:53:18.207
I heard all the covers.
but the original's the best.

386
00:53:18.308 --> 00:53:20.007
Undine?

387
00:53:20.641 --> 00:53:22.371
I have to ask you something.

388
00:53:23.474 --> 00:53:24.998
In the café...

389
00:53:25.099 --> 00:53:27.090
the place that banned us.

390
00:53:27.552 --> 00:53:28.832
with the aquarium...

391
00:53:28.933 --> 00:53:30.923
I followed you back then.

392
00:53:31.558 --> 00:53:34.068
- in your break...
- Christoph? Christoph?

393
00:53:34.308 --> 00:53:36.215
- Christoph?
- Hello?

394
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:38.673
Wait. I can't hear you very well.

395
00:53:38.808 --> 00:53:41.257
- Can you hear me?
- Yes. try it now.

396
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:44.423
Were you waiting for someone?

397
00:53:46.099 --> 00:53:48.132
For someone in particular?

398
00:53:49.766 --> 00:53:51.632
I wasn't waiting for anyone.

399
00:53:51.766 --> 00:53:54.706
If you love someone.
you have to tell the truth.

400
00:53:57.308 --> 00:53:59.257
I wasn't waiting for anyone!

401
00:54:02.933 --> 00:54:04.549
You're lying.

402
00:54:07.683 --> 00:54:08.882
No!

403
00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:12.540
This morning on the way
to the train station.

404
00:54:12.641 --> 00:54:14.715
we saw a couple on the path.

405
00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:20.582
You stared after the man.

406
00:54:20.683 --> 00:54:22.840
I could feel your heart beating.

407
00:54:26.058 --> 00:54:29.840
When he walked past
your heart skipped a beat.

408
00:54:30.975 --> 00:54:32.007
Was it him?

409
00:54:32.141 --> 00:54:35.049
- I don't know...
- Is that who you were waiting for?

410
00:54:35.183 --> 00:54:37.424
what you expect me to say.

411
00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:41.466
- You lied to me.
- No!

412
00:54:42.725 --> 00:54:45.174
No... Christoph!

413
00:55:13.933 --> 00:55:17.424
Hello. you have reached the voicemail...

414
00:55:40.059 --> 00:55:43.049
Hello. you have reached the voicemail...

415
00:55:51.184 --> 00:55:52.674
Christoph?

416
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:55.758
Yes.

417
00:55:57.392 --> 00:56:00.091
I was waiting for someone in the café.

418
00:56:01.226 --> 00:56:03.050
His name is Johannes.

419
00:56:05.184 --> 00:56:07.216
I was waiting for him.

420
00:56:09.851 --> 00:56:13.050
I loved him. but he didn't show up.

421
00:56:14.184 --> 00:56:16.883
I thought I couldn't live without him.

422
00:56:25.517 --> 00:56:27.091
And you're right:

423
00:56:27.726 --> 00:56:29.383
I was crying.

424
00:56:32.517 --> 00:56:35.675
And the guy on the bridge...
That was him.

425
00:56:36.809 --> 00:56:39.550
Maybe my heart did skip a beat.

426
00:56:40.267 --> 00:56:43.383
but then it started beating again
under your hand.

427
00:56:45.018 --> 00:56:47.383
And then I understood

428
00:56:47.601 --> 00:56:51.508
that I wasn't waiting for him:
I was waiting for you.

429
00:56:52.143 --> 00:56:53.925
And that made me happy.

430
00:56:55.059 --> 00:56:57.967
More happy than
I'd ever been in my life.

431
00:57:01.601 --> 00:57:03.633
Call me. okay?

432
00:59:13.519 --> 00:59:15.499
- Hey. there. Sorry.
- Christoph!

433
00:59:15.844 --> 00:59:16.944
Could you please.

434
00:59:17.144 --> 00:59:19.334
- Stay here please. madam.
- Let go of me!

435
00:59:19.435 --> 00:59:21.968
Let go of me! Christoph!

436
00:59:22.602 --> 00:59:24.009
Stop!

437
00:59:24.144 --> 00:59:28.009
- Are you Undine?
- Yes. Tell them to let me go.

438
00:59:29.144 --> 00:59:31.343
- Keep hold of her.
- What the hell?

439
00:59:31.602 --> 00:59:33.593
Christoph had an accident.

440
00:59:33.852 --> 00:59:37.722
The turbine suddenly opened
and we couldn't get him up in time.

441
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:42.210
His leg got trapped and he was
deprived of oxygen for a long time.

442
00:59:42.311 --> 00:59:44.641
- The control unit...
- Which hospital?

443
00:59:46.398 --> 00:59:48.718
- I'm sorry. Undine.
- Which hospital?

444
00:59:48.894 --> 00:59:51.694
Solingen Accident Unit.
They're specialists.

445
00:59:52.269 --> 00:59:54.969
If you wait a moment.
I'll drive you there.

446
01:00:16.436 --> 01:00:17.635
Undine?

447
01:00:23.269 --> 01:00:25.302
He went 12 minutes without air.

448
01:00:26.936 --> 01:00:28.802
They say he's brain dead.

449
01:00:45.936 --> 01:00:48.218
Did... he say anything?

450
01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:51.510
He was unconscious when we...

451
01:00:51.644 --> 01:00:53.760
finally pulled him out.

452
01:00:55.394 --> 01:00:58.510
- It was 12 minutes...
- I mean before that.

453
01:01:00.144 --> 01:01:01.885
Before?

454
01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.844
He called me last night.

455
01:01:06.978 --> 01:01:09.302
- Last night?
- Yes. and...

456
01:01:10.436 --> 01:01:13.677
- I lied to him.
- Last night?

457
01:01:16.311 --> 01:01:18.271
You two didn't talk last night.

458
01:01:18.978 --> 01:01:20.260
What?

459
01:01:20.895 --> 01:01:23.435
You didn't talk to each other last night.

460
01:01:24.978 --> 01:01:26.052
We did. I...

461
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:30.669
- We argued on the phone. and...
- He began his dive

462
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.052
at 2:30 p.m. yesterday afternoon.

463
01:01:33.186 --> 01:01:36.052
We pulled him out at 2:57 p.m.

464
01:01:36.311 --> 01:01:40.177
He was declared brain dead
here in the hospital at 3:40 p.m.

465
01:01:40.811 --> 01:01:43.135
So stop talking bullshit. okay?

466
01:01:44.811 --> 01:01:47.002
No. we talked last night.

467
01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:50.427
He's dead.
and you're saying such bullshit!

468
01:02:17.562 --> 01:02:19.094
Undine!

469
01:02:35.229 --> 01:02:36.511
Christoph!

470
01:04:36.771 --> 01:04:38.004
Aren't you hungry?

471
01:04:38.105 --> 01:04:40.137
Just six more lengths.

472
01:04:42.271 --> 01:04:44.345
You call that the butterfly?

473
01:05:39.183 --> 01:05:42.363
- Johannes. it's almost nine. Come on!
- I'm coming.

474
01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:44.943
Your parents are almost here. Hurry up.

475
01:05:45.522 --> 01:05:46.554
Okay.

476
01:07:17.772 --> 01:07:18.971
Johannes?

477
01:08:45.148 --> 01:08:46.889
Undine!

478
01:08:48.315 --> 01:08:49.847
Undine!

479
01:09:37.023 --> 01:09:39.222
I want to see Undine.

480
01:10:07.357 --> 01:10:09.473
Calm down. my friend.

481
01:10:51.598 --> 01:10:56.548
Secondly. officials were unaware of the
cause of Berlin's poor housing situation.

482
01:10:56.649 --> 01:11:00.032
Was it the high purchasing costs.
service costs. or the financing costs

483
01:11:00.232 --> 01:11:05.131
on the mortgage market?
Or was it certain speculative practices

484
01:11:05.232 --> 01:11:07.007
on the real estate market?

485
01:11:07.108 --> 01:11:09.473
This discussion lasted almost 50 years

486
01:11:09.733 --> 01:11:12.848
until they finally agreed on an answer:

487
01:11:12.983 --> 01:11:16.007
The decisive factor was land value.
and that was determined

488
01:11:16.108 --> 01:11:19.015
by pricing the anticipated yield

489
01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:20.423
into the sales price.

490
01:11:20.524 --> 01:11:25.757
Attempts at social housing construction
reform remained unsuccessful for years.

491
01:11:25.858 --> 01:11:30.215
Despite all the discussions.
speeches. exhibits. treatises. protests.

492
01:11:30.316 --> 01:11:34.098
during the entire Wilhelmine era.
nothing changed.

493
01:11:36.316 --> 01:11:39.765
After its end. on November 9. 1918.

494
01:11:39.941 --> 01:11:41.765
everything changed.

495
01:12:11.358 --> 01:12:15.557
1871/72 at the court of the Great...

496
01:12:18.316 --> 01:12:21.846
- I was just at your talk. and...
- We'll continue shortly.

497
01:12:27.483 --> 01:12:30.049
Excuse me. but I need the break.

498
01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:34.320
- The Hobrecht-Plan isn't my strong point.
- I'm looking for Undine.

499
01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:36.599
- Undine Wibeau?
- Yes.

500
01:12:37.858 --> 01:12:40.382
I haven't seen her for months.

501
01:12:40.483 --> 01:12:42.932
Do you know where I can find her?

502
01:12:43.567 --> 01:12:45.257
No idea. Didn't she...

503
01:12:45.358 --> 01:12:49.099
- live in a block at Hackescher Markt?
- I already went there.

504
01:12:52.733 --> 01:12:55.349
Do you know anyone who knows her?

505
01:12:58.483 --> 01:13:02.391
She was a freelancer.
I don't know. Okay...

506
01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:04.432
I have to go.

507
01:13:08.549 --> 01:13:09.549
You see.

508
01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:12.533
- I can't find her anywhere.
- I'm sorry. but...

509
01:13:12.733 --> 01:13:15.391
I have to carry on now. you see.

510
01:14:38.276 --> 01:14:41.475
TWO YEARS LATER

511
01:15:13.693 --> 01:15:15.267
Jochen called.

512
01:15:15.901 --> 01:15:17.642
He's got a job for us.

513
01:15:17.901 --> 01:15:20.225
Two turbines in the Lingese.

514
01:15:20.652 --> 01:15:24.842
He said you don't have to do it.
He can get a stand-in from Hamburg.

515
01:15:24.943 --> 01:15:27.767
- Ludger Feigl. He has time...
- I'll do it.

516
01:15:29.401 --> 01:15:30.725
I'll call him.

517
01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:34.768
I have to drink this crap.
and you want to risk it again?

518
01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.350
Hey...

519
01:15:46.526 --> 01:15:48.309
It was so long ago.

520
01:15:50.443 --> 01:15:52.267
Everything will be fine.

521
01:15:54.901 --> 01:15:57.142
- I felt it move.
- Oh. come on!

522
01:15:57.401 --> 01:15:58.967
- It moved.
- Stop it!

523
01:15:59.068 --> 01:16:02.142
- I swear it!
- No way. it's only the 16th week!

524
01:16:02.276 --> 01:16:04.767
It's huge. Such gigantic...

525
01:16:05.401 --> 01:16:07.559
- movements.
- Stop it!

526
01:18:17.528 --> 01:18:19.810
What's he doing down there?

527
01:18:19.986 --> 01:18:21.435
Can you see anything?

528
01:18:22.069 --> 01:18:23.477
No.

529
01:18:24.736 --> 01:18:26.310
Bring him up.

530
01:19:12.653 --> 01:19:14.185
What happened?

531
01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:15.977
Nothing.

532
01:19:17.861 --> 01:19:20.769
I just dropped something. It's fine.

533
01:20:28.779 --> 01:20:30.478
I was scared.

534
01:21:11.321 --> 01:21:13.061
What was it?

535
01:21:14.196 --> 01:21:15.196
I don't know.

536
01:21:47.821 --> 01:21:49.978
The welding joints look great.

537
01:21:53.113 --> 01:21:54.478
Everything's fine.

538
01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:40.146
Undine!

539
01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.271
Christoph!
