00:18:31.583 --> 00:18:34.041
I think we got more pressing issues
to talk about.

344
00:18:34.125 --> 00:18:36.041
-And what's that?
-They shot your ass.

345
00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:37.958
Nigga. where the money at?

346
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:40.708
Do you not remember
getting lit the fuck up?

347
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:43.500
You should be breathing
through some tubes right now.

348
00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:47.083
-Look. I don't have time--
-You took it. Fontaine. you took it.

349
00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:49.416
You came in here.
you went through my haberdasheries.

350
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.208
You passed up on my beige bitch.
and you went outside and pulled a 50 Cent.

351
00:18:53.291 --> 00:18:54.166
[Charles panting]

352
00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.250
-I told your ass if you wanna settle--
-We can settle it another way.

353
00:18:57.333 --> 00:18:58.791
Ain't no way. Shit.

354
00:18:58.875 --> 00:19:01.375
You Ghost of Christmas Past-ass nigga.

355
00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:03.791
What the fuck kind of shit
you playing on. huh?

356
00:19:03.875 --> 00:19:07.958
You done sold your soul to the devil.
I know what you did. I know what you did.

357
00:19:08.041 --> 00:19:11.166
If there ain't no juice in this
motherfucker. throw the damn bottle away!

358
00:19:13.916 --> 00:19:15.041
[whispering] Fontaine.

359
00:19:15.708 --> 00:19:17.958
I seen them niggas
shoot your ass six times.

360
00:19:18.041 --> 00:19:18.958
Mm-hmm.

361
00:19:21.375 --> 00:19:22.541
[Charles panting]

362
00:19:22.625 --> 00:19:24.000
You think I'm lying. nigga?

363
00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:28.458
You ask Yo-Yo. She took off on me
just before your ass got in here.

364
00:19:29.208 --> 00:19:32.250
Ask that trifling ass bitch
which one of us is crazy.

365
00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:34.166
[funky music playing]

366
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.583
-Uh-uh.
-[man] Come on. baby.

367
00:19:35.666 --> 00:19:38.666
You ain’t getting no motherfucking
David Carradine for 50 bucks.

368
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.625
Most I can do for you is a Susan Sarandon.

369
00:19:40.708 --> 00:19:42.458
-Let me get that.
-[Yo-Yo] Maybe a Shalamar.

370
00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:44.041
Nigga. you better get this good deal.

371
00:19:44.125 --> 00:19:46.750
My bad. Yo-Yo.
Need to steal you for a minute.

372
00:19:47.583 --> 00:19:49.125
[man] Don't you see we busy here?

373
00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:51.166
Don't you see
we'll split your wig down the middle

374
00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.125
and you'll be a half a nigga?

375
00:19:53.208 --> 00:19:57.083
Get your beige ass the fuck out of here.
You fake Obama-looking motherfucker.

376
00:19:57.166 --> 00:19:58.666
That ain't Michelle. nigga.

377
00:19:59.375 --> 00:20:00.750
Y'all owe me 50 dollars.

378
00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:02.458
I am retired.

379
00:20:02.541 --> 00:20:05.000
I just need some more dough
before I can get to Memphis.

380
00:20:05.083 --> 00:20:07.625
[Charles] There it is again.
that slippery slope of recidivism.

381
00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:10.666
-I hate to see it.
-When I'm there. I'mma find me a real man.

382
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.500
Yeah. I'll find you a real man.
'cause I'm a real motherfucker.

383
00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:16.708
[Yo-Yo] Not some McDonald’s-dollar-menu
has-been-ass nigga in a Goodwill suit.

384
00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:19.541
Keep talking goddamnit.
and I'mma slip out of this Goodwill suit

385
00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:21.958
-and slap that fake-ass wig off…
-What the fuck did you--?

386
00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:23.750
…with nothing but my Gucci boxers on

387
00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:25.250
and be back in this coat
before it wrinkles.

388
00:20:25.333 --> 00:20:26.291
You know I can do it.

389
00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:28.500
[Yo-Yo] Oh. here you go
with this ninja pimp shit.

390
00:20:28.583 --> 00:20:29.583
Hey!

391
00:20:31.083 --> 00:20:33.583
I just need to clear something up
with you real quick.

392
00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:35.958
And you can be right back
on your merry hoeing way.

393
00:20:36.041 --> 00:20:37.000
Uh…

394
00:20:37.083 --> 00:20:37.958
Okay.

395
00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:41.750
You seen me last night?

396
00:20:41.833 --> 00:20:42.833
[Yo-Yo] Not like that.

397
00:20:43.333 --> 00:20:45.833
No. Like. literally.

398
00:20:47.125 --> 00:20:48.166
You seen me?

399
00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:50.625
Are you Kevin Bacon?

400
00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:51.875
Wait. What?

401
00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:54.166
Hollow Man. [chuckling]

402
00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:58.166
-That was a good one. You liked it.
-Good movie. Good movie. Yeah.

403
00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.333
And I picked that one. You… mm-hmm. Okay.

404
00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:02.291
Yes. nigga. I saw you.

405
00:21:02.375 --> 00:21:03.958
You heard them shots after?

406
00:21:04.458 --> 00:21:07.583
I mean. I got ears. don’t I?
Somebody was letting them bitches loose.

407
00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:10.666
To be honest. I thought it was you
doing me a favor.

408
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.791
Yo-Yo.

409
00:21:11.875 --> 00:21:14.000
So. what you tryin' to say?
You ain't seen nothin'?

410
00:21:14.083 --> 00:21:16.083
I mean.
I didn't say all of that. [scoffing]

411
00:21:16.166 --> 00:21:18.625
You know your girl gotta know
what’s going on in these streets.

412
00:21:18.708 --> 00:21:21.916
So. yeah.
I doubled back after a cool little minute.

413
00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:25.000
I think I saw the perpetrators leaving.

414
00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:26.583
-[Charles] I told you.
-[Yo-Yo grunting]

415
00:21:27.583 --> 00:21:28.625
Well. and?

416
00:21:28.708 --> 00:21:29.666
[Yo-Yo scoffing]

417
00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:35.208
Yeah. I recognize the whip.
'cause I do house calls over on Second.

418
00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:37.333
Hold on. I ain't sanctioned that shit.

419
00:21:37.416 --> 00:21:40.250
Sometimes. I see the car parked
a few driveways down.

420
00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:42.041
So. yeah. It looked mad familiar.

421
00:21:45.208 --> 00:21:47.250
-Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!
-[car engine starting]

422
00:21:47.333 --> 00:21:50.625
[scoffing] I'm done. You said I could go
on my merry hoeing way.

423
00:21:50.708 --> 00:21:54.375
[DJ] It's your boy. DJ Strangelove.
I know it's been a long day.

424
00:21:54.458 --> 00:21:57.625
I know you need that tall glass of wine.
I got that new Ruckus.

425
00:21:57.708 --> 00:21:59.166
"So Tired."

426
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.125
Damn. I hate this motherfucking song.

["So Tired" by Twelve'len playing]

428
00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:05.291
Fontaine. can you change
this depressing-ass shit?

429
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.083
Every time this song come on. I get…

430
00:22:08.583 --> 00:22:10.000
[yawning] …sleepy as hell.

431
00:22:10.083 --> 00:22:11.625
[all yawning]

432
00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:19.000
Mm. The house coming up on the left
over here. Oh. that's the car right there.

433
00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:21.583
What the hell you looking at?
That ain’t the car.

434
00:22:21.666 --> 00:22:23.750
-That is the car.
-Yo-Yo. that ain't the car.

435
00:22:23.833 --> 00:22:26.250
-I know what I saw. Don't tell me--
-Wait a minute.

436
00:22:26.833 --> 00:22:28.333
[Fontaine] I know that car.

437
00:22:28.416 --> 00:22:30.083
[Charles] What you talking about?

438
00:22:30.166 --> 00:22:33.375
[Fontaine] I saw it earlier the other day
at the liquor store.

439
00:22:33.458 --> 00:22:36.166
[Charles] So? Every rapper

You know what. Fontaine? You got this.

So I'mma let you go and do your thing.
and I'mma just sit right here in the car.

444
00:22:51.916 --> 00:22:53.916
Fresh air might be good
for a nigga. though.

445
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.291
[funky music playing]

446
00:23:01.083 --> 00:23:03.625

447
00:23:03.708 --> 00:23:06.916
[Charles] Fontaine. this ain't no pimpin'.
There ain't nothing pimp about this.

448
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.458
Fuck! I dropped my ring.

449
00:23:08.541 --> 00:23:09.458

Oh. yeah. See. this is cute.
This could be the living room.

461
00:23:32.458 --> 00:23:35.541
Maybe some dark wood.

462
00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:37.916
[whispering] Where this room go?

Girl. you done lost your rabbit-ass mind?
Why you got a gun?

[Moss talking indistinctly]

685
00:34:26.583 --> 00:34:28.375
[Moss] Hey. man. It's all good!

686
00:34:28.958 --> 00:34:31.500
Even players mess up

687
00:34:32.083 --> 00:34:35.083
Look. you know what? Matter of fact?
We all about to get some water.

Hey! Hey. man! I thought…
I thought we were riding with you.

692
00:34:46.166 --> 00:34:49.916
It's different now. Like. they got

693
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.125
-What about the lab?
-[Fontaine] Gone.

694
00:34:52.208 --> 00:34:54.416
That creepy-ass elevator? That's gone too.

695
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.500
Damn. They did have good walls.

696
00:34:57.583 --> 00:34:59.250
Either that or I'm going crazy.

697
00:35:00.458 --> 00:35:03.125
And last night. that shit happened. right?

698
00:35:03.208 --> 00:35:05.291
[Charles] I had a nightmare
that the shit happened.

699
00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:06.416
So. yeah. it happened.

700

Ho ain't got no crackers or nothing?
You got pots and pans.

Your grandma ain't cook nothing?

702
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.958
[Yo-Yo] Yo. shut up. Will you let me think
for five seconds? Just stop.

703
00:35:14.041 --> 00:35:15.458
What would that Scooby-Doo bitch do?

704
00:35:15.541 --> 00:35:16.916
Nancy Drew?

705
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.541

00:35:27.541 --> 00:35:30.666
why don't we sit around a table
that's got some food on it?

711
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.041
A pimp's blood sugar is falling fast.

712
00:35:33.125 --> 00:35:34.833
[funky music playing]

713
00:35:34.916 --> 00:35:37.291
We could use some comfort food

[narrator] Limited time only.
Hot Box spicy. fried-chicken

-Right. Right.

723
00:36:00.666 --> 00:36:01.708
Okay.

724
00:36:01.791 --> 00:36:04.666
As with any mystery.
you gotta lay out the facts.

725
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:05.625
[Charles] Mm-hmm.

726
00:36:05.708 --> 00:36:07.083
[Yo-Yo] What is it we know?

727
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:10.541

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.541
[Charles and Yo-Yo laughing]

731
00:36:18.625 --> 00:36:21.000

-Which makes what? Two Fontaines?
-Two Fontaines. Double 'Taine.

734
00:36:26.708 --> 00:36:32.000
And we also know there's
an underground trap-house laboratory.

735
00:36:32.083 --> 00:36:34.625
[all chuckling]

736
00:36:34.708 --> 00:36:38.291
[Yo-Yo] But Deebo here.
he said the damn elevator gone.

737
00:36:38.375 --> 00:36:42.916
And that shit or whatever clues we had

738
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.458
[all laughing]

739
00:36:45.541 --> 00:36:48.833
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
It won't hurt to smile once in a while.

740
00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:53.208
You know. I've known this motherfucker
for years. I ain't never seen him laugh.

741
00:36:53.291 --> 00:36:54.125
Not once.

742
00:36:54.791 --> 00:36:56.166
I've never seen him laugh.

743
00:36:56.958 --> 00:36:58.875
I've never seen you laugh.

744
00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:00.750
Yeah.

745
00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:03.416
You know. I ain't seen him laugh once.

746
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.166
[patrons laughing]

747
00:37:12.458 --> 00:37:14.458

748
00:37:22.791 --> 00:37:24.875

749
00:37:29.125 --> 00:37:30.208
[Charles] Shit!

-It's the goddamn chicken.
-[Yo-Yo] What?

752
00:37:34.125 --> 00:37:34.958
It's the chicken.

753
00:37:36.375 --> 00:37:37.583
The… the powder.

754
00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:39.625
The powder in the chicken.

755
00:37:39.708 --> 00:37:42.291
Look. When I was in the trap house.
there was a white powder there.

756
00:37:42.375 --> 00:37:44.625
I thought it was cocaine.
I took some. it wasn't cocaine.

757
00:37:44.708 --> 00:37:47.625
I start laughing. you break something.
I shoot a nigga. Now we're here.

We eat this chicken. we all laughing.

759
00:37:50.291 --> 00:37:52.041
It's in the fucking chicken.

760
00:37:56.458 --> 00:37:58.875
That Muppet-looking motherfucker
is the one who sold it to us.

761
00:37:58.958 --> 00:38:00.166
Are you connecting these dots?

762

00:38:05.625 --> 00:38:09.291
-We know how you ask questions.
-Nigga. you ain't got good bedside manner.

765
00:38:09.958 --> 00:38:12.000
-Let… let me go talk to him.
-What?

766
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.833
Let me do my thing.

767
00:38:13.916 --> 00:38:15.041
Five minutes.

768
00:38:15.125 --> 00:38:19.041
Teamwork. guys. Teamwork. Don't forget.
There's no "I" in "Got Damn."

769

[both giggling]

775
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.333
It's our motto.

776
00:38:30.416 --> 00:38:33.833
There's just something
about that new spicy chicken.

777

-You know. pimps stay buttoned up--
-[Yo-Yo] Okay. Save that for later.

This is my fault.

Yes. sir.

the brighter side of things.

1955
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.375
[man] Maybe when this is over.
I'll have the boys come down

1956
01:40:46.458 --> 01:40:49.541
and scrape up some of your cells.
grow me a secretary.

1957
01:40:49.625 --> 01:40:50.833
[Yo-Yo] Well. you know what?

1958
01:40:50.916 --> 01:40:53.291
I might have
a few complaints to file with HR

1959
01:40:53.375 --> 01:40:55.750
about the working conditions
in this bitch.

1960
01:40:55.833 --> 01:40:59.250
[man] Speaking of Human Resources.
where are your friends?

1961
01:40:59.333 --> 01:41:01.375
Fucking up your shit as we speak.

1962

01:41:07.125 --> 01:41:08.125
You're

1965
01:41:09.083 --> 01:41:09.916
me.

1966
01:41:11.125 --> 01:41:11.958
No.

1967
01:41:13.125 --> 01:41:14.500
You're me.

1968
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.625
One of the many
I've had to create over the years.

1969
01:41:18.208 --> 01:41:21.000
So. what. you… you working for them?

1970
01:41:21.833 --> 01:41:25.791
Let's just call it
a marriage of convenience.

1971
01:41:26.875 --> 01:41:29.625
I'm the lead geneticist of this operation.

1972
01:41:30.625 --> 01:41:32.041
But… but why?

1973
01:41:34.541 --> 01:41:35.416
Ronnie.

1974
01:41:37.208 --> 01:41:38.083
Ronnie.

1975
01:41:39.166 --> 01:41:40.000
is he--

1976
01:41:40.083 --> 01:41:40.958
No. no.

1977
01:41:41.958 --> 01:41:42.791
He died

1978
01:41:43.666 --> 01:41:45.458
just the way you remember.

1979
01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:49.000
It's the one thing
I wanted you all to have.

1980
01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:53.083
But yes. he is the reason
I made a deal with the devil.

1981
01:41:53.583 --> 01:41:54.416
[gun firing]

1982
01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:57.708
[man] A lot of paperwork. Yo-Yo.
You know I hate paperwork.

1983
01:41:57.791 --> 01:41:59.625
-[Yo-Yo] Fuck paperwork!
-[whispering] Patience.

1984
01:41:59.708 --> 01:42:02.125
-[Yo-Yo] I hope you get buried in it!
-Pimp hand raised.

1985
01:42:02.208 --> 01:42:04.041

-Ready.

[gun firing]

1989
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:08.583
Shit.

1990
01:42:08.666 --> 01:42:11.125
[man] You know.
we got operations everywhere.

1991
01:42:11.666 --> 01:42:14.083
-Los Angeles. Chicago.
-Fuck.

-[Charles grunting]
-[gun firing]

1993
01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:18.500
[man] But I picked the Glen
because it was supposed to be quiet.

1994
01:42:19.166 --> 01:42:21.250
Well. here you are causing a racket.

1995
01:42:22.041 --> 01:42:25.541
You see. Fontaine.
the… the powers that be.

1996
01:42:25.625 --> 01:42:29.083
the invisible people above me
who pull the strings.

1997
01:42:29.166 --> 01:42:31.166
weren't getting the results they wanted.

1998
01:42:31.708 --> 01:42:33.833
Years of experimentation.

1999
01:42:33.916 --> 01:42:37.875
Billions of dollars spent.
yet no true peace in America.

2000
01:42:39.208 --> 01:42:40.541
Hair products.

2001
01:42:41.791 --> 01:42:44.291
songs on the radio. fried chicken.

2002
01:42:46.166 --> 01:42:49.250
Clones maintaining the charade.

2003
01:42:51.375 --> 01:42:54.458
Short-sighted. waste of resources.

2004
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:58.750
All because they couldn't see
what's so obvious to you and me.

2005
01:43:00.083 --> 01:43:02.000
It's not enough to think the same.

2006
01:43:03.333 --> 01:43:05.625
we have to be the same.

2007
01:43:06.708 --> 01:43:08.250
Nah. You tripping. man.

2008
01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:13.916
My work in the Cloning Initiative
helped me track down 378 unique genes

2009
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.416
that separate you and your ghettos

2010
01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:21.875
from your counterparts
in the suburbs. the barrios…

2011
01:43:24.083 --> 01:43:25.041
Chinatown.

2012
01:43:25.958 --> 01:43:27.625
Once I sequenced them all.

2013
01:43:27.708 --> 01:43:30.875
I approached my superiors
with an addendum.

2014
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:34.666
and I'm sure you're aware
of our first test subjects.

2015
01:43:36.708 --> 01:43:37.708
In the lab.

2016
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:39.666
the tech.

2017
01:43:40.625 --> 01:43:41.541
the manager.

2018
01:43:41.625 --> 01:43:45.041
Not complete successes. but they pass.

2019
01:43:46.125 --> 01:43:47.125
It's the hair.

2020
01:43:47.208 --> 01:43:50.125
It's stubborn.

2021
01:43:51.333 --> 01:43:53.666
But we have since perfected the process.

2022
01:43:54.166 --> 01:43:55.541
I think niggas might notice

2023
01:43:55.625 --> 01:43:58.666
if they wake up one morning
with blond hair and blue eyes.

2024
01:43:59.250 --> 01:44:01.500
This won't happen overnight. Fontaine.

2025
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:05.791
It'll happen over generations.

2026
01:44:07.125 --> 01:44:12.541
And now we are at the precipice
of our true national rollout.

2027

2029
