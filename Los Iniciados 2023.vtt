00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:46.875
POLICE

4
00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.083
Frank Molina.

5
00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:55.208
Even the rain won't stop
the vultures from coming.

6
00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:57.666
Can I take a look?

7
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.250
It's easy. Almagro.

8
00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:06.208
You either let me in.
and I write about it or I'll go home

9
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:09.875
and write about you
and your awful police department.

10
00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:11.750
Two minutes.

11
00:01:58.666 --> 00:01:59.916
Young couple.

12
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:02.500
In their 30s.

13
00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:09.916
Call an ambulance! Almagro!

14
00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:15.250
All three of us were going to die.

15
00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:52.708
Happy?

16
00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.000
You can leave now.

17
00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.541
You know they overdosed.

18
00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:02.875
It's not even worth an article
on that shitty magazine.

19
00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.750
They died from drinking toxic rainwater.

20
00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:11.625
No one's stupid enough to drink that shit.

21
00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:15.166
They died from too much faith.

22
00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:23.958
The girl was alive.

23
00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:28.958
Had you done your job well.
you could have saved her.

24
00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:53.916
Come on! Hit hard!

25
00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:58.666
Come on!

26
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:05.916
Ladies and gentlemen.

27
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.791
everyone's favorite!

28
00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:14.333
Lady Massacre!

29
00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:17.250
- Lady!
- Lady!

30
00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:21.625
RESIST
FIGHT

31
00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:23.458
NO FEAR

32
00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:30.291
Introducing this season's
undefeated champion!

33
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.916
The lady of the night.

34
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.375
The Queen of Chaos!

35
00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:41.708
Okay. ladies. Let's put on a great show.

36
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:45.083
No low blows. No scratching.

37
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.791
Hey. hey. hey!

38
00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:57.083
Break it up or you're out!

39
00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:58.291
Break it up!

40
00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:01.875
Both back to your corners. On my count.

41
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.000
- Lady!
- Lady!

42
00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:16.208
Come on!

43
00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:18.541
Get up! Fight.

44
00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:24.166
This is Lady Massacre?

45
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.750
What are you doing? You were told to lose!

46
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.291
- Lady!
- Lady!

47
00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.750
THE INITIATED

48
00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:34.791
It's no secret that the past ten years
were the most challenging for all of us.

49
00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:40.666
The city saw
all of its potable water sources dry up.

50
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.041
Killing us. one after another.

51
00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:44.250
Not only from thirst.

52
00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:47.666
but also from diseases
that we hadn't suffered for centuries.

53
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.708
This relentless acid rain
floods our streets. poisoning our bodies.

54
00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:57.541
like a castaway dying of thirst
in an ocean full of water

55
00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:01.291
from which he cannot drink a single drop.

56
00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:04.791
Water scarcity is real.
we can't deny that.

57
00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:07.208
But it must not cloud our judgment.

58
00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:11.250
That's why today.
it's my pleasure to introduce to you

59
00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:13.500
the Kasbah Development Plan.

60
00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:17.250
A project intended
to revolutionize this space

61
00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:20.375
towards a future
never seen before in this city.

62
00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:25.500
Mayor. do you have your father's approval
to promote such a change?

63
00:07:25.583 --> 00:07:29.625
Since the start of my candidacy.
I've been an independent leader.

64
00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:32.916
His political machine isn't independent.

65
00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:35.875
Thank you.

66
00:07:45.708 --> 00:07:49.333
The fight was two hours ago.
If you came to cheer me on. you're late.

67
00:07:49.416 --> 00:07:50.791
You don't need a cheerleader.

68
00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:55.083
What you need is a responsible adult
to help remove your makeup.

69
00:07:55.166 --> 00:07:58.750
- How have you survived so long without me?
- I don't know.

70
00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.041
What's wrong?

71
00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:05.458
The family from the shop disappeared too.

72
00:08:09.583 --> 00:08:12.208
- The house is empty.
- You have to publish it.

73
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:16.000
- I need to talk to Frank Molina first.
- The drunk journalist?

74
00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:19.250
- This is too big for me.
- Don't ever say that again.

75
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:21.125
You're the best at what you do.

76
00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:23.750
Let's go home. I'll tell you all about it.

77
00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:27.916
- I don't know if I'll sleep at home.
- I forgot tonight's your date.

78
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.708
- I can see him tomorrow.
- No. you waited a long time to see him.

79
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:34.416
I know you. Moni.
You came here because you need me.

80
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.000
- Let's go home.
- Girl. I'm fine.

81
00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:43.750
- Bye.
- Listen. if anyone can fix this. it's you.

82
00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:47.666
- I love you.
- Love you too.

83
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.541
Naughty.

84
00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:53.208
Always.

85
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:06.041
You're welcome.

86
00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:31.750
Pass.

87
00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:33.125
Gentlemen.

88
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:35.833
I won this one.

89
00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:37.166
Yeah!

90
00:09:40.791 --> 00:09:41.875
Deal.

91
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.958
What's up. Molina?

92
00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:47.666
You even owe your soul.

93
00:10:01.541 --> 00:10:02.458
Pass.

94
00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.291
What are you doing?

95
00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:10.000
What do you mean. Molina?

96
00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:11.583
Do you think I'm stupid?

97
00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:13.833
- Be a good sport.
- Or learn to play.

98
00:10:13.916 --> 00:10:15.250
What are you going to do?

99
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.166
Mr. Frank Molina.

100
00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:37.833
MÃ³nica Perea.

101
00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:40.666
I've been looking for you for hours.

102
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.791
Next time. follow the rats
and you'll find me.

103
00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:47.916
- How are you. Moni?
- I bought an apartment.

104
00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:53.750
- How's freelance journalism going?
- See for yourself.

105
00:10:54.666 --> 00:10:55.500
KASBAH

106
00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:56.625
I like the title.

107
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.958
You're always fighting.

108
00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:01.708
The only thing I know
in this life is to fight.

109
00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:04.333
Sorry about
what happened to you at the paper.

110
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:08.750
That paper wasn't for me.
I write for The Evening Chronicle now.

111
00:11:08.833 --> 00:11:10.500
You deserve a better place.

112
00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.458
What did you need me for?

113
00:11:18.666 --> 00:11:20.208
When I was in your class.

114
00:11:20.291 --> 00:11:23.083
you told me there are cases
you're scared to face.

115
00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:27.458
And those were the ones we needed to face.
and never turn our backs on.

116
00:11:28.833 --> 00:11:33.625
- That teacher no longer exists.
- People from the Kasbah are disappearing.

117
00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:37.791
I have data. witnesses...

118
00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:43.291
Like I said. then why do you need me?

119
00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:47.000
I need a journalist to help me
figure out what's going on.

120
00:11:47.083 --> 00:11:51.458
Publish it yourself. You've got
what it takes to make some noise.

121
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.666
Frank. I just need a few hours.

122
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.166
Tomorrow.

123
00:12:03.833 --> 00:12:06.416
Let's talk tomorrow.
You know where to find me.

124
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:11.458
- I never thought I'd end up in a ring.
- Why?

125
00:12:11.541 --> 00:12:13.458
Because of my dad.

126
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:17.291
He'd come home with a broken nose
and a swollen face after each fight.

127
00:12:18.375 --> 00:12:20.166
He was like this house. you know?

128
00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:23.750
He had so much potential.

129
00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:28.000
but his soul was full of secrets
and spiderwebs.

130
00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:32.791
It belonged to my family.

131
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.750
It's been empty for years.

132
00:12:36.666 --> 00:12:39.416
My brother and I used to come hide here.

133
00:12:40.333 --> 00:12:42.166
Looks like you're still doing it.

134
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.375
I'm not hiding. Gaby.

135
00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:48.625
This is who I am.
I don't hide anything from you.

136
00:12:50.666 --> 00:12:51.833
What?

137
00:12:53.208 --> 00:12:54.833
I'm staring into your soul.

138
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.208
And. what do you see?

139
00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:00.375
Fear.

140
00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:02.583
But not of you.

141
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:05.791
Everything but me.

142
00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:09.166
Wait.

143
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.375
I have a gift for you.

144
00:13:18.333 --> 00:13:22.541
Do you know how a woman feels
when she gets a gift after sex?

145
00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:25.541
It's not like that.
I've spent months planning this.

146
00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:29.541
If I only allow you to give me
one present in this life.

147
00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:30.916
will it be this one?

148
00:13:40.458 --> 00:13:41.541
Do you like it?

149
00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:43.916
It's beautiful. I love it.

150
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.291
Put it on.

151
00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:47.333
No.

152
00:13:48.583 --> 00:13:51.125
Let's save it for my next fight.

153
00:13:59.333 --> 00:14:00.875
KASBAH
RESISTS

154
00:14:07.166 --> 00:14:08.166
THE BEAUTY IS ON THE STREETS

155
00:14:42.708 --> 00:14:43.708
Gaby?

156
00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:03.083
Gaby?

157
00:16:04.708 --> 00:16:08.583
- What happened?
- A girl jumped from the third floor.

158
00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:39.916
How ironic that in a place
where it never stops raining.

159
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.041
you can't drink the water
because it's toxic.

160
00:16:45.916 --> 00:16:50.125
This family knew. and they said.
"Enough is enough."

161
00:16:51.916 --> 00:16:57.666
We're like a plummeting plane.
and every passenger refuses to believe it.

162
00:16:59.833 --> 00:17:02.750
The moment we realize it...

163
00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:09.500
It'll be so late that we'll see our bodies
crash violently against the pavement.

164
00:17:10.083 --> 00:17:13.958
"The only power we have left.
our last rebellious act.

165
00:17:14.041 --> 00:17:18.958
will be to choose to either die of thirst.
or die by drinking toxic rainwater."

166
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.541
What the hell is this. Molina?

167
00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:26.416
Five pages of nonsense?
Not even one picture.

168
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.333
You've been working here for months.
and no graphic work yet.

169
00:17:31.416 --> 00:17:33.791
No big scoops. I gave you a camera.

170
00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:36.958
Once again. you know
I'm not a photographer.

171
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:40.291
Then why are you sitting there?
I don't get it.

172
00:17:44.791 --> 00:17:47.041
Look. this is what I need.

173
00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:50.458
Sensationalism.
not the bullshit you gave me.

174
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.875
People have a morbid curiosity.

175
00:17:56.458 --> 00:17:57.958
What's this?

176
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:09.125
A trans girl who jumped out of a window.
I don't know.

177
00:18:09.208 --> 00:18:12.250
Molina. I'm going to tell you something
so that we are clear.

178
00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:14.083
See what I'm asking for?

179
00:19:20.583 --> 00:19:21.583
Frank.

180
00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:29.916
Frank.

181
00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:40.250
Frank. Frank!

182
00:19:41.291 --> 00:19:44.041
Calm down. It's me. Carmen.

183
00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:46.166
Relax.

184
00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.625
What are you doing here?

185
00:19:49.708 --> 00:19:51.958
I was worried.
You wouldn't answer your phone.

186
00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:54.041
We haven't talked in a year.

187
00:19:57.541 --> 00:19:59.375
Siblings can feel each other here.

188
00:19:59.458 --> 00:20:02.541
This time. your sixth sense failed.

189
00:20:03.083 --> 00:20:04.958
I'm fine.

190
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.916
- I'll make you soup for your hangover.
- I'm not hungry.

191
00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:13.875
- Why won't you let me help?
- I don't need anyone's help.

192
00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.458
Especially you.

193
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:17.583
When did you last take your pills?

194
00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:21.166
I took them.
I'm taking my pills regularly.

195
00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:27.250
You need help. Frank. Professional help.

196
00:20:27.333 --> 00:20:29.416
No. forget it.

197
00:20:33.083 --> 00:20:34.291
You're bipolar. Frank.

198
00:20:38.083 --> 00:20:40.041
I won't go back to the mental hospital.

199
00:20:49.125 --> 00:20:50.416
What's this?

200
00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:54.208
No. that's...

201
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.875
A friend who committed suicide.

202
00:20:59.666 --> 00:21:01.916
Why are you looking at that?

203
00:21:03.458 --> 00:21:06.083
Something doesn't add up.

204
00:21:06.583 --> 00:21:09.625
- So. you're investigating?
- I'm not investigating.

205
00:21:09.708 --> 00:21:12.875
- Why don't you investigate that?
- I'm not a detective.

206
00:21:14.125 --> 00:21:18.666
I'm just a fucking loser
floating in a shithole.

207
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.833
You want to feel sorry for yourself?
That's on you.

208
00:21:21.916 --> 00:21:25.250
- I won't play along.
- You don't need to.

209
00:21:25.333 --> 00:21:27.458
Did I ask you to come? Did I call you?

210
00:21:29.541 --> 00:21:33.333
I'll tell you one thing.
and I won't say it again.

211
00:21:37.875 --> 00:21:39.166
Okay. what is it?

212
00:21:40.083 --> 00:21:42.500
You're the best journalist
in this shithole.

213
00:21:43.666 --> 00:21:48.458
Wash your face.
Take your pills. Go to work.

214
00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:51.958
Your friend died and you'll just sit here?

215
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.708
You're not like this. Frank.
You care about people.

216
00:22:00.125 --> 00:22:03.375
I'll make you soup.
whether you like it or not.

217
00:22:45.208 --> 00:22:48.500
The police won't do anything.
The government won't do a thing.

218
00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:51.166
No one cares what happens in the Kasbah.

219
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.375
This is bullshit.
Are we supposed to stay silent?

220
00:22:54.458 --> 00:22:56.000
Not do anything?

221
00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:57.500
How can we change that?

222
00:22:58.791 --> 00:23:00.083
By resisting.

223
00:23:00.625 --> 00:23:02.041
Like Moni did.

224
00:23:02.125 --> 00:23:03.458
- Like Moni did.
- Like Moni did.

225
00:23:03.541 --> 00:23:05.166
Like Moni did.

226
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.750
- To Moni.
- To Moni.

227
00:23:08.791 --> 00:23:09.875
Gaby...

228
00:23:19.041 --> 00:23:20.708
FOR MONI

229
00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:23.458
Frank.

230
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:25.250
What are you doing here?

231
00:23:26.416 --> 00:23:28.583
I talked to Moni the night she died.

232
00:23:28.666 --> 00:23:31.458
- I told her not to talk to you.
- I'm on your side.

233
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:36.291
- We're nowhere near on the same side.
- We both know Moni didn't kill herself.

234
00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:39.958
No! Moni would have never done that.

235
00:23:40.041 --> 00:23:41.791
That's why I have some questions.

236
00:23:41.875 --> 00:23:43.708
You spoke to her the night she died.

237
00:23:43.791 --> 00:23:46.791
Moni must have told you
what you need to know.

238
00:23:47.458 --> 00:23:48.791
No. that night I couldn't...

239
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.375
I couldn't do anything for her.

240
00:23:53.458 --> 00:23:57.750
If you couldn't while she was alive.
what can you do for her now?

241
00:23:57.833 --> 00:23:59.833
- Let me help.
- Want to help?

242
00:23:59.916 --> 00:24:01.333
Start by finding her.

243
00:24:03.083 --> 00:24:05.083
I don't get it. Finding her?

244
00:24:05.166 --> 00:24:08.041
The body's missing.
It's not at the fucking morgue.

245
00:24:08.125 --> 00:24:10.333
The police don't know anything.

246
00:24:10.416 --> 00:24:12.083
No one knows where she is.

247
00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:23.000
Do you know
how many bodies are here. Molina?

248
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.791
We have a tuberculosis
and leprosy outbreak.

249
00:24:28.875 --> 00:24:31.625
The water shortage
is taking us back to the Middle Ages.

250
00:24:31.708 --> 00:24:33.125
It won't take much time.

251
00:24:33.958 --> 00:24:37.000
I know you take the unclaimed bodies

252
00:24:37.083 --> 00:24:40.250
and run all sorts of experiments
with them.

253
00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:43.416
I just want to know
if my friend ended up that way.

254
00:24:44.208 --> 00:24:47.083
- When was she brought in supposedly?
- Saturday.

255
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:54.750
- What was her name?
- MÃ³nica Perea.

256
00:24:59.833 --> 00:25:01.708
Your friend wasn't brought here.

257
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.583
I don't get it.

258
00:25:12.666 --> 00:25:15.750
We're not the only ones
who make bodies disappear.

259
00:25:15.833 --> 00:25:17.458
Give me a hand.

260
00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:20.333
This girl was important to me.

261
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:23.958
If you want to know
what happened to her...

262
00:25:25.083 --> 00:25:27.000
go ask the police.

263
00:25:35.875 --> 00:25:37.958
Aren't you going to pay for that?

264
00:25:38.041 --> 00:25:39.166
Molina.

265
00:25:40.125 --> 00:25:43.416
Hey. I waited for your article

266
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.333
about the alleged poisoned families.

267
00:25:47.416 --> 00:25:48.833
What happened?

268
00:25:48.916 --> 00:25:51.166
I didn't know you were a loyal reader.

269
00:25:52.291 --> 00:25:55.041
See? I respect your job.

270
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.625
You're always fucked up and miserable.
and still go to work every morning.

271
00:26:00.708 --> 00:26:01.875
I admire that.

272
00:26:03.958 --> 00:26:06.125
Here. On the house.

273
00:26:06.208 --> 00:26:08.958
Go crawl back
into that hole you came from.

274
00:26:13.666 --> 00:26:15.833
If you didn't come to beg.
why are you here?

275
00:26:16.583 --> 00:26:18.458
What happened to MÃ³nica Perea's body?

276
00:26:18.541 --> 00:26:20.166
What do you mean?

277
00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:24.000
It disappeared after the crime scene.
What happened to the body?

278
00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:26.708
A lot of things are disappearing.

279
00:26:26.791 --> 00:26:29.958
Maybe it was a clerical mistake.
Nothing to investigate.

280
00:26:30.041 --> 00:26:32.208
- Who gave the order?
- What order?

281
00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:35.166
The order to make
MÃ³nica Perea's body disappear.

282
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.916
What are you trying to hide?

283
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.791
Why don't you stop making stuff up?

284
00:26:40.583 --> 00:26:44.875
- You think someone's hiding something?
- Why don't you do your job properly?

285
00:26:44.958 --> 00:26:46.708
Fuck you.

286
00:26:46.791 --> 00:26:49.375
Why did you get rid
of MÃ³nica Perea's body?

287
00:26:51.916 --> 00:26:53.583
If you have something to accuse us of.

288
00:26:53.666 --> 00:26:56.416
why don't you publish it
in that paper you work at?

289
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.666
Leave me the fuck alone.

290
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:01.625
Someone wants to make a murder
look like a suicide. and you know who.

291
00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:04.166
Really?

292
00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:08.041
That sounds dangerous. right?

293
00:27:09.833 --> 00:27:13.750
Maybe she was sticking her head
where she shouldn't and that was her end.

294
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.708
You're smart. Molina.

295
00:27:18.416 --> 00:27:20.166
What's the lesson here?

296
00:27:25.833 --> 00:27:26.833
Good luck.

297
00:28:36.666 --> 00:28:37.958
What's that?

298
00:28:38.916 --> 00:28:41.333
What are you doing here? Let me see.

299
00:28:41.416 --> 00:28:43.500
- Nothing.
- Let me see.

300
00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.208
"Deadly Wrestler."

301
00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:51.916
- Do you like it?
- That's the worst name I've ever heard.

302
00:28:52.958 --> 00:28:53.833
Guess what.

303
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:57.416
- What?
- I have something you'll love.

304
00:28:58.416 --> 00:28:59.958
- Show me.
- Guess.

305
00:29:00.041 --> 00:29:01.791
- Come on.
- Guess!

306
00:29:01.875 --> 00:29:03.958
What do you have there? Show me.

307
00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:14.708
"Lady Massacre."

308
00:29:15.708 --> 00:29:16.750
Do you like it?

309
00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:18.708
I love it.

310
00:29:19.083 --> 00:29:20.166
I love you.

311
00:29:23.958 --> 00:29:25.416
What would I do without you?

312
00:30:23.958 --> 00:30:26.458
I don't get the media obsession
with my dad.

313
00:30:26.541 --> 00:30:31.000
- It's normal. He left an important legacy.
- But they should move on.

314
00:30:31.083 --> 00:30:32.625
Don't worry about that.

315
00:30:32.708 --> 00:30:38.208
You must focus on getting the votes
you need for the Kasbah renovation.

316
00:30:38.291 --> 00:30:40.750
That'll keep you in the spotlight.

317
00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:45.416
How's my approval rating?

318
00:30:47.916 --> 00:30:50.791
Well. it's very high in the Kasbah.

319
00:30:52.041 --> 00:30:53.750
Because we're doing things right.

320
00:30:53.833 --> 00:30:58.541
Yes. but the councilmen's approval
has really dropped off.

321
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.083
I'll talk to them individually.
Let's organize an event.

322
00:31:09.166 --> 00:31:11.416
We need those votes. whatever it takes.

323
00:31:13.791 --> 00:31:15.500
No one cares about a button.

324
00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:17.875
It's important.

325
00:31:18.666 --> 00:31:21.500
Especially to the people
you need on your side.

326
00:31:22.291 --> 00:31:26.000
The closer you're to the Kasbah.
the farther you are from your own people.

327
00:31:26.083 --> 00:31:29.875
Yes. you must know I work
for the councilmen and the Kasbah.

328
00:31:30.416 --> 00:31:33.208
You're either on their side.
or on this side.

329
00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:34.583
It's simple.

330
00:31:38.166 --> 00:31:40.750
See? It's never about just a button.

331
00:31:46.791 --> 00:31:48.458
On our wedding night...

332
00:31:50.666 --> 00:31:52.083
Will you unbutton me?

333
00:31:54.958 --> 00:31:57.125
We'll see on our wedding night.

334
00:32:33.875 --> 00:32:34.958
Sir.

335
00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:39.583
Tell VerÃ³nica I've to make a call.

336
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:53.416
I talked to the police chief.
but nobody knows what happened.

337
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.708
Really? The police are useless.

338
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:58.583
I don't know what else to do.
I've asked around.

339
00:32:58.666 --> 00:33:01.958
- If you can't. then who will?
- We must change the system.

340
00:33:02.041 --> 00:33:04.041
I can't wait for a damn change.

341
00:33:06.208 --> 00:33:08.250
What they did to her is horrible.

342
00:33:09.666 --> 00:33:11.000
Were you able to sleep?

343
00:33:12.583 --> 00:33:13.708
We'll talk later.

344
00:33:32.958 --> 00:33:34.833
Leviathan Lopez was a legend.

345
00:33:35.416 --> 00:33:37.583
- You knew my dad?
- Of course. like everyone.

346
00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.708
You know how it all ended.

347
00:33:40.625 --> 00:33:45.166
- They took his mask during a fight.
- The worst humiliation for a wrestler.

348
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:47.958
I read somewhere that

349
00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:54.208
he had Morgellons from drinking rainwater.
and that's why he had trouble wrestling.

350
00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:56.083
He had an alcohol problem.

351
00:33:59.458 --> 00:34:00.750
How did you meet Moni?

352
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.625
She never told me.

353
00:34:04.333 --> 00:34:05.541
She was my student.

354
00:34:06.541 --> 00:34:07.791
At the university.

355
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.416
I remember she refuted everything
in our first class.

356
00:34:13.458 --> 00:34:15.333
Then. we became good friends.

357
00:34:15.416 --> 00:34:18.583
In fact. she gave me this tape recorder.

358
00:34:19.458 --> 00:34:20.625
I still use it.

359
00:34:22.208 --> 00:34:23.583
How did you meet her?

360
00:34:24.208 --> 00:34:26.166
Moni wrote an article about me.

361
00:34:28.583 --> 00:34:30.958
When I read it.
I felt I didn't really know myself.

362
00:34:31.916 --> 00:34:33.375
She had that effect.

363
00:34:34.666 --> 00:34:35.791
She had...

364
00:34:36.583 --> 00:34:38.833
an extraordinary talent.

365
00:34:39.958 --> 00:34:41.666
Frank. what do you think happened?

366
00:34:43.583 --> 00:34:48.875
Gaby. like I said earlier.
I don't buy the suicide thing.

367
00:34:50.916 --> 00:34:52.500
Look under the table.

368
00:35:07.333 --> 00:35:09.583
Moni was defending herself from someone.

369
00:35:10.666 --> 00:35:12.458
The night she tried to talk to me.

370
00:35:12.541 --> 00:35:15.500
she said she was investigating
some disappearances.

371
00:35:15.583 --> 00:35:18.166
- Do you know about that?
- It's all in this box.

372
00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:21.166
There are files. phone numbers.

373
00:35:23.166 --> 00:35:24.458
Let's see.

374
00:35:24.791 --> 00:35:26.666
This is Moni's notebook.

375
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.625
Let me see if there's something here.

376
00:35:30.916 --> 00:35:33.541
There must be information
about who killed her.

377
00:35:41.458 --> 00:35:43.291
She never took that medallion off.

378
00:35:45.375 --> 00:35:48.750
- When did she become religious?
- Moni was an atheist.

379
00:35:52.208 --> 00:35:54.541
Since she started
investigating disappearances.

380
00:35:54.625 --> 00:35:57.791
she started going to church.
and talking to Father LÃ¡zaro.

381
00:36:08.958 --> 00:36:11.458
Where did you get all that water. Father?

382
00:36:11.541 --> 00:36:15.125
Help me. Put all the water up here.

383
00:36:22.458 --> 00:36:23.541
Come in.

384
00:36:25.625 --> 00:36:26.875
Welcome.

385
00:37:06.125 --> 00:37:07.083
Frank.

386
00:37:08.791 --> 00:37:09.875
I'm busy.

387
00:37:10.708 --> 00:37:13.250
It's just a minute. Father.
It's important.

388
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.541
It was a tragedy.
She used to welcome migrants.

389
00:37:19.625 --> 00:37:21.833
She was our contact
with the drought zones.

390
00:37:21.916 --> 00:37:25.500
She was investigating some disappearances.

391
00:37:25.583 --> 00:37:28.125
Do you know about that?
Did she tell you anything?

392
00:37:28.208 --> 00:37:30.458
Well. I don't know if this is useful.

393
00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:33.791
but she asked about some people
who didn't come back to church.

394
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.208
Do you remember their names?
Do you know who they were?

395
00:37:41.583 --> 00:37:42.708
Wait for me here.

396
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.958
I dreamt about you.

397
00:37:52.875 --> 00:37:54.083
What?

398
00:37:54.166 --> 00:37:55.708
I dreamt about you.

399
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:06.500
What's your name?

400
00:38:09.333 --> 00:38:12.041
Her name is Alicia. She's dying.

401
00:38:23.458 --> 00:38:25.083
These are the names.

402
00:38:27.416 --> 00:38:29.708
Leonidas Chamorro. Yara's brother?

403
00:38:35.125 --> 00:38:37.583
Do you know where these people lived?

404
00:39:04.291 --> 00:39:05.583
ABANDONED

405
00:39:18.916 --> 00:39:19.958
Hello?

406
00:39:27.458 --> 00:39:28.791
ABANDONED

407
00:39:49.125 --> 00:39:51.250
ABANDONED

408
00:40:22.208 --> 00:40:23.875
I thought you were dead. Frank.

409
00:40:25.083 --> 00:40:26.708
I need your help. Yara.

410
00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:31.416
It's about your brother.

411
00:40:36.875 --> 00:40:38.458
What about Leo?

412
00:40:40.375 --> 00:40:42.208
I want to know what happened to him.

413
00:40:45.833 --> 00:40:47.958
Leo had a foundry at the Kasbah.

414
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.458
They threatened him to sell it.

415
00:40:51.833 --> 00:40:55.833
He kept saying no
until one day he just disappeared.

416
00:40:57.125 --> 00:40:59.458
People said he left. but...

417
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:03.250
He would have never left
without telling me.

418
00:41:04.833 --> 00:41:09.625
When someone disappears like that.
it's like they have stolen your life.

419
00:41:11.666 --> 00:41:13.166
I'm very sorry. Yara.

420
00:41:16.041 --> 00:41:17.833
I apologize for insisting. but...

421
00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:21.833
What happened to the foundry?

422
00:41:24.791 --> 00:41:26.625
It's completely abandoned.

423
00:41:29.333 --> 00:41:30.833
Where is it located?

424
00:42:30.791 --> 00:42:33.458
Keep investigating. watch what happens.

425
00:43:44.375 --> 00:43:47.291
The meaning of the artifact is ambiguous.

426
00:43:49.083 --> 00:43:51.541
That's just how things are.

427
00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:58.250
Ambiguity is the daughter of ignorance.

428
00:44:02.916 --> 00:44:05.666
Are you sure
this is the artifact I asked for?

429
00:44:06.458 --> 00:44:10.541
Absolutely. The museum
has been tracking it for a decade.

430
00:44:10.958 --> 00:44:14.333
Besides its historical value.
I don't think it has any meaning.

431
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.916
That's not possible.

432
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.083
It's a map for the Snake's Nest.

433
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.708
We've been looking for it for years.

434
00:44:50.583 --> 00:44:52.250
I was right.

435
00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:56.041
The Snake's Nest does exist.

436
00:45:14.625 --> 00:45:18.291
DANGER DO NOT CROSS

437
00:50:32.041 --> 00:50:33.333
He's dead!

438
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:34.916
Run!

439
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:14.541
The police investigated the crime scene.
but they didn't find anything.

440
00:51:14.625 --> 00:51:17.125
They said there weren't any ashes.

441
00:51:17.208 --> 00:51:20.041
The paper will need actual facts.

442
00:51:20.125 --> 00:51:22.000
They're killing and cremating people.

443
00:51:22.083 --> 00:51:24.000
- They threw Moni in there.
- Why?

444
00:51:24.083 --> 00:51:27.208
Because a suicide
was more convenient than a murder.

445
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:30.291
What was their plan?
To kill her and take her.

446
00:51:30.375 --> 00:51:32.375
She defended herself with a box cutter.

447
00:51:32.458 --> 00:51:35.291
They fought.
and she fell through the window.

448
00:51:35.375 --> 00:51:38.625
They weren't prepared for that.
The body couldn't end up at the morgue.

449
00:51:40.125 --> 00:51:43.125
- Evidence. brother. Evidence.
- I don't need evidence.

450
00:51:46.458 --> 00:51:48.500
Are you taking your pills?

451
00:51:56.791 --> 00:51:58.291
Did you bring what I asked?

452
00:52:11.416 --> 00:52:13.166
This can't be right.

453
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:18.083
It can't be right. It says here that
the foundry is owned by Evelio Torres.

454
00:52:18.166 --> 00:52:19.375
This can't be right.

455
00:52:19.458 --> 00:52:22.583
The foundry's owner is Leonidas Chamorro.

456
00:52:22.666 --> 00:52:25.416
Leonidas Chamorro owns the foundry.

457
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.000
- And he's also missing?
- Exactly!

458
00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:31.958
What do you know about Torres?

459
00:52:34.375 --> 00:52:35.708
No one knows anything.

460
00:52:36.708 --> 00:52:39.166
A DA was working on his case. but...

461
00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:41.708
Can't you see. Palestina?

462
00:52:41.791 --> 00:52:44.833
Something big is happening.
Everything's connected.

463
00:52:44.916 --> 00:52:48.333
What can MÃ³nica. Chamorro.
Evelio and the rest of your map

464
00:52:48.416 --> 00:52:50.541
have in common? I don't get it.

465
00:52:50.625 --> 00:52:53.583
That's what I mean. they're all missing.

466
00:52:53.666 --> 00:52:56.000
We don't know where they are.
It's not the same.

467
00:52:56.083 --> 00:52:58.333
Okay. I know.

468
00:53:00.708 --> 00:53:03.666
- Which DA had Torres's case?
- No...

469
00:53:06.375 --> 00:53:07.583
DA Gamboa.

470
00:53:07.666 --> 00:53:09.958
Get me in touch.
I bet she knows something.

471
00:53:10.041 --> 00:53:14.125
Do you know what the paper will do to me
if they know I helped you?

472
00:53:14.833 --> 00:53:16.916
They've never noticed before.

473
00:53:17.875 --> 00:53:20.125
I need to talk to that DA.

474
00:53:34.083 --> 00:53:35.416
What are you doing here?

475
00:53:55.041 --> 00:53:56.291
Everything will be fine.

476
00:53:58.916 --> 00:53:59.875
Hey.

477
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.291
Everything will be fine.

478
00:54:04.375 --> 00:54:05.541
Nice.

479
00:54:05.625 --> 00:54:06.750
Welcome. Mr. Mayor.

480
00:54:06.833 --> 00:54:08.083
It's been so long.

481
00:54:09.333 --> 00:54:10.625
Well...

482
00:54:10.708 --> 00:54:11.833
The usual?

483
00:54:26.041 --> 00:54:27.625
She is schooling us.

484
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.083
- I'm glad we're not playing for money.
- Watch and learn. Okay.

485
00:54:33.291 --> 00:54:34.750
Tonight's winner.

486
00:54:45.916 --> 00:54:50.208
This is the only place
where he can just be Ignacio.

487
00:54:50.291 --> 00:54:52.041
Being here is like therapy for him.

488
00:54:52.125 --> 00:54:56.708
He told me you took him to the fights.
You're the reason we met.

489
00:54:56.791 --> 00:54:58.541
Here's to Cupid.

490
00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:04.625
Cupid needs to pee.

491
00:55:17.875 --> 00:55:19.791
You're holding the cue the wrong way.

492
00:55:24.375 --> 00:55:26.416
Pay attention. You have to grab-- Here.

493
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:56.583
I remember that case perfectly.

494
00:55:57.166 --> 00:56:00.958
Torres had worked for years
to buy that land.

495
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.625
He and his wife grew cassava and potatoes.

496
00:56:07.208 --> 00:56:08.208
Thanks.

497
00:56:08.291 --> 00:56:09.458
Enjoy.

498
00:56:13.916 --> 00:56:17.541
Then a man told them someone
was interested in buying their land.

499
00:56:17.625 --> 00:56:19.666
- Torres refused.
- Why?

500
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:22.208
Do you know how many years
a peasant must work

501
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:24.875
in this country
to be able to own something?

502
00:56:28.541 --> 00:56:31.083
Torres didn't want to lose what he had.

503
00:56:32.333 --> 00:56:34.333
They threatened him in every way.

504
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.250
Until one day.
Torres went to town to buy diapers.

505
00:56:38.333 --> 00:56:39.791
and never came back.

506
00:56:39.875 --> 00:56:41.458
Imagine how hard that was.

507
00:56:41.541 --> 00:56:43.625
She had to declare her husband dead

508
00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:48.250
to be able to sell the land to the people
who most probably killed him.

509
00:56:48.333 --> 00:56:51.666
They paid whatever they wanted.
Next to nothing.

510
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.291
The poor woman was practically left
on the streets with her girls.

511
00:56:59.458 --> 00:57:01.833
What happened to her?
Where did she end up?

512
00:57:11.916 --> 00:57:14.291
- I'll talk to her.
- Leave her alone.

513
00:57:14.375 --> 00:57:17.916
That woman has gone through a lot
to survive with her girls.

514
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.083
She doesn't even know I took that case.

515
00:57:23.166 --> 00:57:25.916
- Who did she sell the land to?
- I couldn't track them.

516
00:57:26.541 --> 00:57:27.541
Look...

517
00:57:29.958 --> 00:57:34.583
Whoever killed Torres.
uses his name to buy more properties.

518
00:57:34.666 --> 00:57:36.541
Do you think this is a systematic plan?

519
00:57:36.625 --> 00:57:42.333
The foundry owner is Leonidas Chamorro.
Like Torres. he disappeared.

520
00:57:42.416 --> 00:57:46.916
Torres appears as the owner now.

521
00:57:47.666 --> 00:57:50.458
Lots of people
from the Kasbah disappeared.

522
00:57:50.958 --> 00:57:53.625
I bet they're doing
the same thing to them.

523
00:57:54.250 --> 00:58:00.041
How can I find out what other properties
our late Torres has been buying?

524
00:58:04.958 --> 00:58:06.500
Want some advice. Molina?

525
00:58:07.666 --> 00:58:09.916
Leave this alone
and stop asking questions.

526
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.166
You could have told me on the phone.
You came because you want to help.

527
00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:15.916
- Fuck you.
- You and I owe her.

528
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.916
How will we repay her? By buying her soup?

529
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:21.041
Or by helping her?

530
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:27.833
Wait here. I'll make a call.

531
00:58:47.791 --> 00:58:48.833
Molina.

532
00:58:50.625 --> 00:58:53.416
Promise me you won't stop
until you publish this.

533
00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:55.458
so those fuckers pay for what they did.

534
00:58:55.541 --> 00:58:57.083
I promise.

535
00:59:00.958 --> 00:59:04.750
You have no idea how many properties
are under Torres's name.

536
01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:56.541
Frank.

537
01:03:59.708 --> 01:04:02.083
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

538
01:04:02.166 --> 01:04:04.625
What's this place? What's going on?

539
01:04:11.708 --> 01:04:13.791
It's the last source of water in the city.

540
01:04:14.916 --> 01:04:16.708
Drinking water?

541
01:04:16.791 --> 01:04:18.875
Like it's never even been touched by men.

542
01:04:20.083 --> 01:04:23.166
The natives called it "The Snake's Nest."

543
01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:27.625
They also believed
it had healing properties.

544
01:04:28.541 --> 01:04:30.541
People should know about it.

545
01:04:30.625 --> 01:04:34.208
- No one can know. Promise me.
- Listen to me.

546
01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:37.458
Someone very dangerous
already knows about this place.

547
01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.333
That's impossible.

548
01:04:39.416 --> 01:04:42.500
They're taking over
all the properties near your church.

549
01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:46.458
That's why they killed Moni.
They wanted her apartment.

550
01:04:46.541 --> 01:04:48.958
The same
with the people from her building.

551
01:04:49.041 --> 01:04:51.458
The same happened to Leonidas Chamorro.

552
01:04:52.041 --> 01:04:53.708
Leonidas... left.

553
01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:57.166
He was murdered and cremated.
They're cremating people.

554
01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.833
And I'm sure you're next.

555
01:05:00.583 --> 01:05:01.791
Look. Father.

556
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.416
This medallion was inside
a furnace at the foundry.

557
01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:12.125
Look at it. Look carefully.

558
01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:22.833
MÃ³nica.

559
01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:27.625
They're coming for the water.
They want the water.

560
01:05:27.708 --> 01:05:29.375
No. the water is for everyone.

561
01:05:30.541 --> 01:05:32.625
What's underground belongs to the people.

562
01:05:33.375 --> 01:05:36.791
It's useless owning
all the properties around it.

563
01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:39.000
Nothing belongs to the people.

564
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.125
Whoever is behind this.

565
01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:49.333
has enough power
and knows exactly what he's doing.

566
01:05:49.416 --> 01:05:52.916
- How bad is it?
- The illness is getting worse.

567
01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:55.583
You need clean water soon.

568
01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:01.208
What's this?

569
01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.416
A little addition to the bill.

570
01:06:05.583 --> 01:06:06.875
We can't do this.

571
01:06:06.958 --> 01:06:09.875
You're the mayor.
You can do whatever you want.

572
01:06:09.958 --> 01:06:12.791
The whole bill might not pass
if I add this now.

573
01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:16.083
People will vote for you
if they believe in your leadership.

574
01:06:16.166 --> 01:06:18.500
They won't accept
the privatization of the subsoil.

575
01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:23.333
Why not?
You'll work to renovate the surface.

576
01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:27.125
And we'll take what's below.

577
01:06:27.208 --> 01:06:28.500
The water.

578
01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:31.458
I work for the people.
not for some property.

579
01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:33.083
It's not just some property.

580
01:06:33.166 --> 01:06:37.500
- There's nothing underground.
- Everything's underground.

581
01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:41.708
Look at all this.

582
01:06:41.791 --> 01:06:46.250
It's all part of your imagination.
How many more people will die for this?

583
01:06:46.333 --> 01:06:49.958
The lack of water rots the body.

584
01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:53.833
and poisons the soul.

585
01:06:53.916 --> 01:06:57.833
I'm building a future for this town.
not you and your crazy ideas.

586
01:06:57.916 --> 01:06:58.875
I am.

587
01:07:00.291 --> 01:07:02.375
This is the most important thing for me.

588
01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:04.791
I'm changing history.

589
01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:06.875
Our world...

590
01:07:08.833 --> 01:07:10.416
is like a beast

591
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.083
that has been growing and getting fatter

592
01:07:14.166 --> 01:07:17.666
for many years. and has a clear fate.

593
01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:21.666
You're not changing anything.

594
01:07:22.333 --> 01:07:25.791
You're only making the beast stronger.

595
01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:29.125
- The beast is dying.
- The beast is immortal.

596
01:07:29.958 --> 01:07:34.416
Are you hearing the nonsense
and the insane things you're saying?

597
01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:38.583
Is that how you want people
to remember you? As a crazy king?

598
01:07:42.916 --> 01:07:45.458
I won't add it to the law.

599
01:07:45.541 --> 01:07:46.500
Lady Massacre.

600
01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:48.416
Does it ring a bell?

601
01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:52.875
Look at the last page.

602
01:07:55.916 --> 01:08:01.791
There's a local journalist
that wants money for those pictures.

603
01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:08.333
Can you imagine how people will
remember you if those get published?

604
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:14.958
If your father. this crazy king.
wasn't here to protect you.

605
01:08:15.041 --> 01:08:16.458
what would happen?

606
01:08:16.916 --> 01:08:18.083
Who else knows about it?

607
01:08:18.166 --> 01:08:20.416
I can make it disappear right now.

608
01:08:21.333 --> 01:08:26.000
as long as you commit to pass that bill.

609
01:08:26.083 --> 01:08:31.791
And also.
end the relationship with that wrestler.

610
01:09:06.333 --> 01:09:08.916
THE KASBAH

611
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.916
REFORM
THE MAYOR AND HIS FATHER

612
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.791
"DISAPPEARED LEAVING NO TRACE"
SAYS HIS WIFE

613
01:09:32.458 --> 01:09:37.125
Palestina. call your editor and demand
he publish this thing about the mayor.

614
01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:40.791
There's no evidence.

615
01:09:41.458 --> 01:09:45.166
The mayor wanting a meeting
to add a section to a bill

616
01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:47.625
to privatize the underground
is not enough.

617
01:09:47.708 --> 01:09:49.666
Palestina. evidence of what?

618
01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:55.083
Isn't it a coincidence that the mayor
added this after this massacre?

619
01:09:55.166 --> 01:09:58.458
It's obvious that the mayor's
responsible for these murders.

620
01:09:58.541 --> 01:10:02.833
The mayor's responsible for Moni's death.
Do you think it's not enough?

621
01:10:02.916 --> 01:10:04.000
No.

622
01:10:04.666 --> 01:10:06.333
I know.

623
01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:10.500
One thing is to say they want the water.

624
01:10:10.583 --> 01:10:12.458
and another one is to ask the paper

625
01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:16.125
to publish with no evidence
that they cremated people in a furnace.

626
01:10:16.666 --> 01:10:19.958
Do you want to die in prison
for slander or libel?

627
01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:21.416
I don't.

628
01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.083
Look. let's do this.

629
01:10:24.041 --> 01:10:27.416
Give me the editor's number.
I'll call. show him my investigation--

630
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.041
I believe you.

631
01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:34.375
I believe you.

632
01:10:35.916 --> 01:10:37.958
I need you to understand something.

633
01:10:39.708 --> 01:10:43.416
- Your mind isn't working right.
- Why won't you listen to me?

634
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:48.000
This is not a manic episode.
I'm seeing things clearly.

635
01:10:48.083 --> 01:10:50.458
- Do you know what I see?
- What?

636
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:53.666
I see the Frank from six months ago.

637
01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:57.291
I see the Frank who fucked up his career.

638
01:11:00.541 --> 01:11:02.416
We've been through this. brother.

639
01:11:03.083 --> 01:11:05.000
We know how it ends.

640
01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:33.375
You're working for the mayor.

641
01:11:33.458 --> 01:11:36.458
- Fuck you.
- How much is he paying you?

642
01:11:38.125 --> 01:11:40.583
He sent you here to talk to me.

643
01:11:40.666 --> 01:11:43.916
How much is he paying?
Or are you fucking him? Tell me.

644
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.541
- Tell me what your deal is?
- I can't do this anymore.

645
01:11:47.625 --> 01:11:50.875
No... Are you fucking
the son or the father?

646
01:11:51.833 --> 01:11:55.458
Tell him I already know everything.
Tell him I know everything.

647
01:11:56.625 --> 01:11:58.458
And tell him I'll send him to jail.

648
01:11:59.291 --> 01:12:02.375
I'll make sure he pays
for what he did to Moni.

649
01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:04.250
Tell him I said so.

650
01:12:04.333 --> 01:12:06.625
If I'm the only one willing
to defy the monster.

651
01:12:06.708 --> 01:12:09.083
to face him head on.
to look him in the eyes.

652
01:12:09.166 --> 01:12:11.625
I'm going to do it.
because I can't stop now.

653
01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:13.916
Because I can finally see
everything clearly.

654
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.375
I am getting to the other side.
emerging from this putrefaction.

655
01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:20.583
I'll stand up for Moni.
and justice will be done.

656
01:12:20.666 --> 01:12:23.333
Because. no. I can't be afraid.

657
01:12:23.416 --> 01:12:27.291
I can't be afraid. Moni knew very well
we were initiated into the horror.

658
01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:30.791
She knew we were being pushed
into a bottomless pit.

659
01:12:30.875 --> 01:12:33.041
an infinite abyss.

660
01:12:33.125 --> 01:12:36.250
Hitting against the walls.
bouncing off of them.

661
01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:37.583
Getting smashed.

662
01:12:37.666 --> 01:12:41.250
Me. my voice. the dead.
the water. the rain. the blood.

663
01:12:41.333 --> 01:12:43.625
everyone under the same fucking fear.

664
01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:45.000
We have to stop this fall.

665
01:12:45.083 --> 01:12:47.791
this abomination taking our lives.
our water.

666
01:12:47.875 --> 01:12:51.041
We've gotten to this point
without knowing. planning. understanding.

667
01:12:51.125 --> 01:12:54.666
If I have to bury myself
in the walls of the abyss

668
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:58.000
and tear myself open to stop it. so be it.

669
01:12:58.083 --> 01:13:01.125
We're overlapping demons.
one on top of the other.

670
01:13:01.208 --> 01:13:05.875
We see everything from outside. from afar.
from the sewer...

671
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:14.916
From the place where the rats live.
pretending to be gods.

672
01:14:18.875 --> 01:14:19.875
Gaby.

673
01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:22.708
Frank. hello.

674
01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:24.458
No...

675
01:14:25.958 --> 01:14:29.041
No. not you. Anyone but you.

676
01:14:31.125 --> 01:14:34.041
- Everyone has their secrets.
- Secrets?

677
01:14:34.125 --> 01:14:36.583
- Shame on you.
- What are you talking about?

678
01:14:36.666 --> 01:14:38.166
What's in it for you?

679
01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:41.416
I have a fight in half an hour.

680
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:45.875
What did he offer you?
To introduce you to everyone? To his dad?

681
01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:49.625
- I don't have to explain myself.
- You'll never keep up with them.

682
01:14:50.666 --> 01:14:53.583
- What's your problem?
- I looked behind your mask.

683
01:14:53.666 --> 01:14:55.250
I know exactly who you are.

684
01:14:58.375 --> 01:15:01.625
You're a crazy drunk
who has no idea where he's standing.

685
01:15:01.708 --> 01:15:05.166
If you think you can judge me.
you're very wrong.

686
01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:08.250
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care if you don't.

687
01:15:08.708 --> 01:15:10.666
The mayor had Moni killed.

688
01:15:11.416 --> 01:15:12.708
And you helped him.

689
01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:15.500
Frank...

690
01:15:20.666 --> 01:15:22.125
What are you talking about?

691
01:16:43.041 --> 01:16:44.291
Get up!

692
01:16:47.791 --> 01:16:49.000
Fight!

693
01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:51.791
Fight!

694
01:16:59.375 --> 01:17:00.458
Fight!

695
01:17:02.416 --> 01:17:03.541
Gaby!

696
01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:05.416
Fight!

697
01:17:08.083 --> 01:17:10.625
Come on. get up!

698
01:17:21.125 --> 01:17:22.083
Gaby!

699
01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:26.416
- Gaby!
- Let's go.

700
01:18:25.083 --> 01:18:27.791
Mr. Mayor. Miss VerÃ³nica. Welcome.

701
01:18:29.291 --> 01:18:32.000
- Ma'am. Mr. Mayor.
- Well done.

702
01:18:32.083 --> 01:18:35.041
Congratulations. The project is amazing.

703
01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:37.208
- Congratulations.
- Antonio. my pleasure.

704
01:18:37.291 --> 01:18:41.500
I'm sure that with your support.
this project will change the city.

705
01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:43.291
All the best. Mr. Mayor.

706
01:18:45.333 --> 01:18:46.416
Good.

707
01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:49.791
You have all their votes.

708
01:18:52.791 --> 01:18:53.791
Are you sure?

709
01:18:54.458 --> 01:18:55.708
Good evening. Mayor.

710
01:18:55.791 --> 01:18:57.791
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

711
01:18:59.291 --> 01:19:01.000
The last vote you needed.

712
01:19:03.916 --> 01:19:05.541
This has never happened before.

713
01:19:07.958 --> 01:19:09.166
Not even to the old man.

714
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:13.375
The city has the leader it needs.

715
01:19:15.291 --> 01:19:17.250
Not even Augusto has this much power.

716
01:19:21.833 --> 01:19:23.958
Mayor. nice to meet you. Congratulations.

717
01:19:24.041 --> 01:19:25.458
Thank you very much.

718
01:19:26.291 --> 01:19:29.583
- We hadn't seen each other since...
- Your campaign. Mr. Mayor.

719
01:19:32.958 --> 01:19:34.083
Stay with the mayor.

720
01:19:42.666 --> 01:19:43.583
What is it?

721
01:19:45.083 --> 01:19:46.208
A journalist.

722
01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.541
Let me pat you down.

723
01:19:58.916 --> 01:19:59.791
Come in.

724
01:20:02.458 --> 01:20:03.666
May I? Thank you.

725
01:20:07.041 --> 01:20:08.208
Why in here?

726
01:20:08.291 --> 01:20:09.750
Mr. Augusto wants to see you.

727
01:20:11.041 --> 01:20:13.625
- Okay.
- Done?

728
01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:15.166
- Done?
- Relax.

729
01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:18.291
Okay. I'm fine.

730
01:20:32.291 --> 01:20:34.083
- Did you search him?
- Yes. sir.

731
01:20:39.416 --> 01:20:42.583
- Frank Molina.
- I need to talk to the mayor.

732
01:20:42.666 --> 01:20:47.583
Since when is The Evening Chronicle
interested in politics?

733
01:20:47.666 --> 01:20:51.583
Since I had to investigate
systematic displacements and killings.

734
01:20:52.958 --> 01:20:54.333
No one killed anyone here.

735
01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:56.833
I have enough evidence that your son

736
01:20:56.916 --> 01:20:59.708
has been having people killed
to get their properties.

737
01:20:59.791 --> 01:21:01.291
You've got nothing.

738
01:21:01.375 --> 01:21:04.583
All you have on your wall
are the speculations of a madman.

739
01:21:05.458 --> 01:21:06.625
How do you know that?

740
01:21:06.708 --> 01:21:09.583
Why do you have
that church marked in the map?

741
01:21:09.666 --> 01:21:13.708
What were you looking for?
Tell me. Did you discover something?

742
01:21:16.166 --> 01:21:18.333
Did you find water. Molina?

743
01:21:20.666 --> 01:21:23.875
- It wasn't the mayor.
- Is the water under the church?

744
01:21:23.958 --> 01:21:26.083
You got all those people killed...

745
01:21:26.166 --> 01:21:30.458
Did you get all those people killed
just to bottle the water?

746
01:21:30.541 --> 01:21:33.666
Do you really need more money?
What else do you need to buy?

747
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:38.000
That water isn't going to be bottled.

748
01:21:39.583 --> 01:21:43.125
That water is for healing.

749
01:21:44.791 --> 01:21:46.208
You're dying.

750
01:21:48.583 --> 01:21:51.000
How long did they say you had left?

751
01:21:52.416 --> 01:21:58.333
You'll rot before seeing
even a drop of that fucking water.

752
01:21:58.958 --> 01:22:01.250
And I promise I'll ruin you.

753
01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.000
That water...

754
01:22:04.375 --> 01:22:06.250
will be mine.

755
01:22:06.333 --> 01:22:09.750
And there's nothing you can do to stop me.

756
01:22:11.083 --> 01:22:15.583
If a million people have to die

757
01:22:16.916 --> 01:22:19.291
for me to live one more day.

758
01:22:20.875 --> 01:22:21.833
so be it.

759
01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:28.750
Now. bow your head.
and leave through the back door.

760
01:22:29.958 --> 01:22:32.541
like the measly dog you are.

761
01:22:32.625 --> 01:22:37.333
unless you want your sister Carmen
to die in a furnace

762
01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:40.333
like your friend MÃ³nica Perea.

763
01:23:16.708 --> 01:23:18.083
You look beautiful.

764
01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.916
This is a farce!

765
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.708
That criminal is systematically killing
dozens of people in the Kasbah!

766
01:23:28.625 --> 01:23:31.958
Just to own the last water source!

767
01:23:42.958 --> 01:23:47.583
He had the journalist MÃ³nica Perea killed
and made it look like suicide.

768
01:23:47.666 --> 01:23:50.166
MÃ³nica Perea didn't commit suicide!

769
01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:52.000
She was murdered!

770
01:23:52.083 --> 01:23:53.291
Ignacio.

771
01:23:54.041 --> 01:23:56.291
Gaby knows everything you did!

772
01:23:56.375 --> 01:24:00.750
She already knows everything!
Gaby knows everything!

773
01:24:00.833 --> 01:24:02.458
Murderers! I'll bring you down!

774
01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:04.125
Dear friends. please ignore him.

775
01:24:04.208 --> 01:24:08.916
He's just an alcoholic journalist
with mental issues.

776
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.791
but let's continue with the party.
Right. son?

777
01:24:12.375 --> 01:24:15.000
Conductor. play some music!
And a round of applause!

778
01:24:17.958 --> 01:24:19.583
Thank you.

779
01:24:23.916 --> 01:24:29.000
...unless you want your sister Carmen
to die in a furnace

780
01:24:29.083 --> 01:24:32.208
like your friend MÃ³nica Perea.

781
01:24:41.458 --> 01:24:45.500
People are clamoring
for their great mayor.

782
01:24:45.583 --> 01:24:48.041
You'd better go and show your face.

783
01:24:48.125 --> 01:24:50.416
Did you see the scandal you just caused?

784
01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:53.500
- No one will believe--
- Public opinion will fuck me up.

785
01:24:53.583 --> 01:24:55.375
That journalist will die tonight.

786
01:24:56.583 --> 01:24:59.000
But we have a loose end.

787
01:24:59.791 --> 01:25:02.125
Your lover knows what we're doing.

788
01:25:03.166 --> 01:25:05.000
I know what you're thinking.

789
01:25:05.083 --> 01:25:09.416
If you blame me. you'll be off the hook.

790
01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:13.958
If I go down. you go down with me.

791
01:25:16.958 --> 01:25:19.375
We have to get rid of your lover.

792
01:25:20.666 --> 01:25:22.541
I can persuade her not to talk.

793
01:25:22.625 --> 01:25:26.750
Do you think I became Augusto Pombo
by persuading people?

794
01:25:26.833 --> 01:25:28.083
I am not Augusto Pombo.

795
01:25:28.166 --> 01:25:33.291
No? You think you rule the city
just because you passed a bill?

796
01:25:33.375 --> 01:25:37.083
Do you know how many bills I have passed?

797
01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:39.083
None of them were unanimously voted.

798
01:25:39.166 --> 01:25:42.916
So. why would you destroy it all?

799
01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.375
For a fucking affair?

800
01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:50.125
I didn't build this empire
to hand it down to a coward.

801
01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:54.625
Think like a Pombo...

802
01:25:55.125 --> 01:25:56.250
Mayor.

803
01:26:08.333 --> 01:26:09.291
Ignacio!

804
01:26:51.208 --> 01:26:52.541
It's not the mayor.

805
01:27:18.625 --> 01:27:19.625
Gaby!

806
01:27:22.291 --> 01:27:23.333
Gaby!

807
01:27:25.041 --> 01:27:26.541
Open up. please.

808
01:27:26.625 --> 01:27:30.625
- Go away. I know what you did.
- Augusto killed Moni behind my back.

809
01:27:30.708 --> 01:27:32.208
- You knew.
- I just found out.

810
01:27:32.291 --> 01:27:33.500
Am I to believe you?

811
01:27:33.583 --> 01:27:36.458
It's the only thing that matters to me.
Please. open up.

812
01:27:40.166 --> 01:27:41.791
There's your research.

813
01:27:54.708 --> 01:27:56.208
You can't burn this.

814
01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:01.291
You can't burn this.

815
01:28:02.208 --> 01:28:04.416
You can't burn this.

816
01:28:10.125 --> 01:28:12.541
Look. you said
you could stare into my soul.

817
01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:17.583
Open. so you know I'm not lying.
Open the door.

818
01:28:18.208 --> 01:28:19.708
Open up. please.

819
01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:27.666
What do you want from me?

820
01:28:33.416 --> 01:28:35.083
Please. for now...

821
01:28:37.166 --> 01:28:39.041
Don't tell anyone what you know.

822
01:28:40.625 --> 01:28:42.250
How can you ask me that?

823
01:28:43.083 --> 01:28:45.958
- Your father killed Moni.
- I know. and he'll pay for it.

824
01:28:46.041 --> 01:28:48.375
- Just give me time.
- No.

825
01:28:49.125 --> 01:28:50.583
Please. Look...

826
01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:55.875
They'll vote the bill next week. If it
doesn't pass. everything will fall apart.

827
01:28:56.916 --> 01:29:00.416
Fall apart?
Your father killed lots of people!

828
01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.166
I know. and he'll pay.
Just give me a week.

829
01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:04.291
Please.

830
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.541
I want to do things right.
Let's go to the police.

831
01:29:11.416 --> 01:29:12.416
No.

832
01:29:16.458 --> 01:29:18.291
Here's his confession.

833
01:29:18.375 --> 01:29:23.208
I promise you once this ends.
I'll go to the police and show it to them.

834
01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:24.708
Please. give me time.

835
01:29:24.791 --> 01:29:26.250
- How did you get it?
- Never mind.

836
01:29:26.333 --> 01:29:29.250
- Give me time. and promise not to tell.
- It's Frank's.

837
01:29:29.333 --> 01:29:32.291
Give me time. Don't tell anyone.
Promise me that.

838
01:29:32.375 --> 01:29:34.916
- I need to hear it.
- Not now. It doesn't matter.

839
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.208
- I must hear it.
- No. Focus on what I'm saying.

840
01:29:37.291 --> 01:29:38.416
Not now!

841
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:43.958
No.

842
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:46.916
No...

843
01:29:49.125 --> 01:29:50.958
You still don't get it. do you?

844
01:29:56.166 --> 01:29:57.583
I'll burn this place down.

845
01:29:59.041 --> 01:30:00.666
I'll throw you in the furnace.

846
01:30:01.375 --> 01:30:04.125
And then. I'll watch you burn.

847
01:30:23.291 --> 01:30:24.666
You can't do this to me.

848
01:30:26.166 --> 01:30:29.500
- You're not doing this to me.
- Get out of my house.

849
01:30:31.625 --> 01:30:33.083
You can't do this to me.

850
01:30:38.125 --> 01:30:39.875
Did you come here to kill me?

851
01:30:39.958 --> 01:30:41.333
Just give me time. okay?

852
01:30:41.958 --> 01:30:43.125
Look me in the eye.

853
01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.875
- You're not doing this to me.
- Look me in the eye.

854
01:30:48.916 --> 01:30:50.583
Did you come here to kill me?

855
01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:54.291
You're not doing this to me.

856
01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:58.583
Not you.

857
01:37:28.166 --> 01:37:29.166
No.

858
01:38:03.541 --> 01:38:04.875
How did you get that?

859
01:38:07.791 --> 01:38:09.041
By dying a little.

860
01:38:14.833 --> 01:38:16.833
Will you be able to live with that?

861
01:38:22.458 --> 01:38:23.791
Do I have a choice?

862
01:38:31.166 --> 01:38:32.583
Where will you go?

863
01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:43.166
I'll resist.

864
01:38:52.791 --> 01:38:53.750
Frank.

865
01:38:56.208 --> 01:38:58.291
Moni would be proud of you.

866
01:40:02.291 --> 01:40:04.208
Do you have evidence for this?

867
01:40:07.458 --> 01:40:10.500
Look. I have
Augusto Pombo's confession here.

868
01:40:13.208 --> 01:40:15.875
They'll want you back
in the paper after this.

869
01:40:15.958 --> 01:40:17.083
No.

870
01:40:17.166 --> 01:40:18.583
I don't want to go back.

871
01:40:19.416 --> 01:40:20.750
What will you do now?

872
01:40:21.708 --> 01:40:23.750
I don't know. I don't know yet.

873
01:40:24.916 --> 01:40:29.375
I'm asking because you're making
one of the worst enemies you could have.

874
01:40:32.083 --> 01:40:35.583
We're looking for the wrestler
who killed your son.
