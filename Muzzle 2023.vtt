00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:11.830
Fuck you!

4
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:48.108
Whew. It's hot out there today.

5
00:01:50.662 --> 00:01:53.389
It's no Iraq.

6
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:58.083
I know I've said it before.
but it's so hot there.

7
00:01:58.187 --> 00:02:00.016
you can literally
fry an egg on a rock.

8
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.569
Literally.

9
00:02:03.985 --> 00:02:06.022
"Literally."

10
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.506
That's a funny word. huh?

11
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.301
It means the opposite
of figurative.

12
00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:12.304
but now it's a synonym.

13
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.446
What?

14
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.621
I mean. it's not the worst
thing. but you got to admit

15
00:02:18.724 --> 00:02:21.624
that when a word that means
something so concrete

16
00:02:21.727 --> 00:02:26.076
can actually now mean
the exact opposite. that's--

17
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.114
that's nuts. right?

18
00:02:29.218 --> 00:02:32.393
Like. something weird
is going on.

19
00:02:32.497 --> 00:02:34.430
Something weird. man.

20
00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:37.466
You know what I heard
the other day?

21
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:40.228
Huh? You'll think this is
hilarious. It's so messed up.

22
00:02:40.332 --> 00:02:43.646
Apparently. they sell chairs now

23
00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.406
designed to feel like
they're hugging you.

24
00:02:46.511 --> 00:02:48.823
You see what I'm saying? And
I don't mean that figuratively.

25
00:02:48.927 --> 00:02:50.308
I mean that literally.

26
00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:52.724
They literally feel
like they're hugging you.

27
00:02:52.827 --> 00:02:54.208
They got these--

28
00:02:54.312 --> 00:02:56.555
I don't know. like.
long. fuzzy. dangly arms.

29
00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.248
They wrap around you.
make you feel good.

30
00:03:02.354 --> 00:03:04.356
What is that?

31
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.669
I'll tell you what it is.

32
00:03:06.772 --> 00:03:08.498
It's loneliness. man.

33
00:03:11.743 --> 00:03:13.883
People don't know
how to be lonely.

34
00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:17.266
Hey. Officer!

35
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.270
Hey. Looking good.

36
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.896
1-Adam-12.
Failure to yield.

37
00:03:28.587 --> 00:03:32.108
Failure to--
There you go. Failure to yield.

38
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.144
Smart man. 1-Adam-12.

39
00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:35.767
Driver's roughly 6 foot.

40
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.252
- Skip that paperwork.
- Requesting K-9.

41
00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:40.012
Ohh. now you got
paperwork. bro.

42
00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:42.083
10-57 Foxtrot. 612 Crocker.

43
00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:44.224
Repeat. 612 Crocker.
Requesting K-9.

44
00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:45.777
This is King 1.
Show me en route.

45
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.227
10-9 that location.

46
00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.642
Okay. 612 Crocker.
King 1 en route.

47
00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:51.300
10-4.

48
00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:55.235
What do you say. bud?

49
00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:35.413
There you go.

50
00:04:35.516 --> 00:04:38.519
Five-oh rolling up.
What's up. boys?

51
00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:41.281
What are y'all doing here?!

52
00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:45.595
Fuck off. Blue!
Nobody wants you here!

53
00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:50.497
Dude rolled a stop.
Tried pullin' him over.

54
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.706
He started driving
like a bat out of hell.

55
00:04:52.808 --> 00:04:55.329
Jumped the curb here
and took off running that way.

56
00:04:55.433 --> 00:04:57.297
- Dangerous?
- Eh.

57
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.159
The fuck took you so long. man?

58
00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:01.542
You walk your fucking dog
over here?

59
00:05:01.646 --> 00:05:04.373
I'll get him out.
You can ask him yourself.

60
00:05:07.203 --> 00:05:08.825
Hasn't been reported stolen.

61
00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:11.828
Something tells me
we're now looking for a...

62
00:05:11.932 --> 00:05:15.522
some Chinese X-I-A...

63
00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:18.145
Hernandez. you got this. buddy.
Now. what's the rule?

64
00:05:18.248 --> 00:05:21.010
"I" before "E"
except after "C." seÃ±or.

65
00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:22.252
You got a description?

66
00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:24.496
Average height.
Hispanic. Skinny.

67
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.567
Definitely not Chinese.

68
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:29.881
Probably undocumented.
Got spooked and ran.

69
00:05:29.984 --> 00:05:32.401
My man Dante over here
got a look.

70
00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:34.126
Seems credible.

71
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.612
- Solid.
- Dante's alright.

72
00:05:36.715 --> 00:05:40.236
Knows everything
on these streets.

73
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.755
Alright. Give me a sec.

74
00:05:41.858 --> 00:05:44.965
Get the fuckin' dog
away from here!

75
00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.455
Alright.
It's time to go to work.

76
00:06:21.207 --> 00:06:22.934
Good. Got drugs.

77
00:06:26.316 --> 00:06:28.111
1-Adam-12 requesting backup.

78
00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:31.356
Copy that. 1-Adam-12. Sending
backup to your location.

79
00:06:37.604 --> 00:06:39.088
- Bingo.

80
00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:44.783
Search. Search. Search.

81
00:06:44.887 --> 00:06:46.233
Come on.

82
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:49.961
Search.

83
00:06:51.859 --> 00:06:54.068
Back there. it's just
a bunch of animals in there.

84
00:06:54.172 --> 00:06:56.105
No place for animals.

85
00:07:03.388 --> 00:07:05.528
Ah. shit!

86
00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:09.049
How are we supposed to clean
their shit off the street

87
00:07:09.152 --> 00:07:12.328
if we can't even get
their shit off the street?!

88
00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.295
Yeah. whatever!

89
00:07:17.402 --> 00:07:20.647
Greene! Make sure no one
wanders the fuck over here!

90
00:07:28.137 --> 00:07:31.105
Hey. LAPD. man.
Hey. We just want to talk.

91
00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.904
Don't run. okay?
I've got a dog.

92
00:07:37.008 --> 00:07:39.251
We just wanna resolve this
without anybody getting hurt!

93
00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.088
Shots fired!
I repeat. shots fired!

94
00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:50.504
Where's my backup?!

95
00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:52.610
Are you hit?

96
00:07:52.713 --> 00:07:54.474
No. I'm okay.

97
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:57.994
- No! Don't touch that!

98
00:08:09.765 --> 00:08:11.836
Go!

99
00:08:13.803 --> 00:08:16.185
Ace!

100
00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:18.014
Just pull back.
Wait for backup!

101
00:08:18.118 --> 00:08:21.155
Son of a bitch.
He put glass on the ground!

102
00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:23.882
Come here. Let me look at you.
Come here.

103
00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:26.471
You're okay. huh?
Yeah? Alright.

104
00:08:26.575 --> 00:08:28.128
Let's go.

105
00:08:38.138 --> 00:08:39.346
Come on.

106
00:09:08.858 --> 00:09:11.067
You good? Huh? Okay.

107
00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:24.840
Show me your hands!

108
00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:27.567
Give me your hands.

109
00:09:30.673 --> 00:09:34.056
Who gave you this jacket?
Where'd they go?

110
00:09:39.337 --> 00:09:42.443
Hey! Hey!
Get on the ground!

111
00:09:42.547 --> 00:09:43.997
Drop the gun!

112
00:10:03.326 --> 00:10:06.019
Ace! Ace?

113
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:10.610
- Ace!

114
00:10:32.114 --> 00:10:34.495
Officer down!

115
00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:36.705
Officer down!

116
00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:40.881
That's good. right?

117
00:10:40.985 --> 00:10:43.712
Hey!
This officer needs attention!

118
00:10:43.815 --> 00:10:47.129
We heard you. man!
We'll get to your dog.

119
00:10:47.232 --> 00:10:50.339
He's a police officer.
He needs help. Now!

120
00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.686
People first. Okay?

121
00:10:54.308 --> 00:10:57.001
Let dispatch know they're gonna
start transporting...

122
00:10:57.104 --> 00:10:58.554
Roger that.

123
00:11:01.868 --> 00:11:03.214
Hey. Get your fucking hands--

124
00:11:03.317 --> 00:11:06.458
Jake! Jake!
Come on! Jake! Come on!

125
00:11:06.562 --> 00:11:08.702
Jake! Calm down!

126
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:14.397
LAPD to King 1.

127
00:11:16.296 --> 00:11:18.091
LAPD to King 1.

128
00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:23.683
LAPD to King 1?

129
00:11:23.786 --> 00:11:26.582
K-9 Ace is 10-7.

130
00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.480
Gone but never forgotten.

131
00:11:28.584 --> 00:11:32.243
Rest in peace. dear friend.
and protect us from above.

132
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.594
We are here today
to remember a true hero...

133
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.907
in every sense of the word.

134
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.910
Ace was not only
a great police K-9.

135
00:11:44.013 --> 00:11:48.362
but was also a loyal partner
of Officer Jake Rosser.

136
00:11:48.466 --> 00:11:52.125
His unwavering bravery
will never be forgotten.

137
00:11:54.092 --> 00:11:57.682
Good and merciful Lord.
we humbly pray

138
00:11:57.786 --> 00:12:00.133
that you will safely keep
all of those

139
00:12:00.236 --> 00:12:03.550
who serve and protect
our communities every day.

140
00:12:03.653 --> 00:12:07.312
In Jesus' name. we pray. Amen.

141
00:12:07.416 --> 00:12:10.212
Port. Arms.

142
00:12:10.315 --> 00:12:13.940
Ready. Aim. Fire.

143
00:12:14.043 --> 00:12:15.320
Ready.

144
00:12:15.424 --> 00:12:17.495
Aim. Fire.

145
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.119
I know.

146
00:12:22.914 --> 00:12:25.572
I know you'd forgive me.

147
00:12:25.675 --> 00:12:27.367
You were always the bigger man.

148
00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:31.440
I don't know how you did it.

149
00:12:33.235 --> 00:12:36.203
I know. I know. I should
stop crying and go home.

150
00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:42.831
Have a little sympathy. man.
I gotta live with this.

151
00:12:45.454 --> 00:12:47.145
Okay.

152
00:12:50.597 --> 00:12:52.185
You're a good boy.

153
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.167
People are angry.

154
00:13:09.271 --> 00:13:11.894
They have expressed
that anger...

155
00:13:11.998 --> 00:13:14.448
And you look no further
than the video to see why.

156
00:13:14.552 --> 00:13:16.450
Again. a warning.
What you're about to see

157
00:13:16.554 --> 00:13:18.487
may be considered upsetting.

158
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.490
After the officer... EMS.

159
00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:24.493
he's seen violently attacking
a Hispanic man.

160
00:13:32.777 --> 00:13:34.227
Oh. hey.

161
00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:39.335
Guys don't find
my night shifts convenient.

162
00:13:40.889 --> 00:13:42.960
Go ahead.

163
00:13:52.038 --> 00:13:53.798
- Lucky dog.
- Huh?

164
00:13:53.902 --> 00:13:55.765
New bed.

165
00:13:55.869 --> 00:13:58.320
Uh. right.

166
00:14:30.835 --> 00:14:33.493
Hey. Uh...

167
00:14:33.596 --> 00:14:35.322
What happened?

168
00:14:37.186 --> 00:14:39.913
Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

169
00:14:40.017 --> 00:14:42.847
Jake. for real...

170
00:14:42.951 --> 00:14:45.746
I'm around if you want to talk.

171
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.991
No pressure or anything.
I just wanted you to know that.

172
00:14:50.061 --> 00:14:53.202
Thanks. I'm good.

173
00:14:56.757 --> 00:14:58.138
Okay.

174
00:15:09.425 --> 00:15:11.393
You entered the building
without backup.

175
00:15:11.496 --> 00:15:14.637
pursued the suspect
up several flights of stairs.

176
00:15:14.741 --> 00:15:16.156
and were ambushed.

177
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.847
My partner and I
entered the building.

178
00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:20.264
and we were ambushed.

179
00:15:20.367 --> 00:15:23.474
But Officer O'Keefe
wasn't with you.

180
00:15:23.577 --> 00:15:27.374
O'Keefe went back to help
after the vehicle exploded.

181
00:15:29.825 --> 00:15:31.758
And you chose not to help?

182
00:15:31.861 --> 00:15:34.209
Even though there was
an officer down.

183
00:15:34.312 --> 00:15:38.627
Well. at that point.
two officers were down.

184
00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.457
And the suspect posed
a significant. violent threat

185
00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:43.908
to the community.

186
00:15:44.012 --> 00:15:46.324
I read the manual.

187
00:15:46.428 --> 00:15:50.190
Tennessee vs. Garner.
It's settled law.

188
00:15:50.294 --> 00:15:52.192
You carried your partner
to first responders.

189
00:15:52.296 --> 00:15:54.470
where you proceeded
to attack one of them.

190
00:15:54.574 --> 00:15:55.713
Is that correct?

191
00:15:55.816 --> 00:15:57.128
You gonna jump in here
any time?

192
00:15:57.232 --> 00:15:58.647
Union's hands are tied.

193
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.994
But don't worry.
I'm taking notes.

194
00:16:01.098 --> 00:16:03.100
Great. Thanks.

195
00:16:03.203 --> 00:16:04.549
We're not the enemy. Jake.

196
00:16:04.653 --> 00:16:06.275
We're just trying
to paint the picture.

197
00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:08.105
I just want to know
what happened to my partner

198
00:16:08.208 --> 00:16:10.176
and who the shooter was.
- Just take a breath.

199
00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:12.316
The suspect commanded my dog.

200
00:16:12.419 --> 00:16:14.870
In German.
Like he was one of us.

201
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:18.529
Okay. We get it.
Now let us do our jobs.

202
00:16:18.632 --> 00:16:21.221
Everything involved
in this mess is S.I.U. now.

203
00:16:21.325 --> 00:16:23.292
under our review
of force investigation.

204
00:16:23.396 --> 00:16:25.674
You mean.
homicide investigation.

205
00:16:32.267 --> 00:16:34.579
You were in the service?

206
00:16:34.683 --> 00:16:36.409
Marines.

207
00:16:36.512 --> 00:16:39.343
Have you ever been diagnosed
with PTSD?

208
00:16:44.244 --> 00:16:47.696
You know the answer.
You knew that when you hired me.

209
00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.663
It wasn't disqualifying.

210
00:16:49.767 --> 00:16:51.700
No. it wasn't.

211
00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:53.322
Did you ever get any treatment?

212
00:16:53.426 --> 00:16:56.084
Maybe prescriptions
or recreational drugs?

213
00:16:56.187 --> 00:16:57.602
Anger issues?

214
00:16:57.706 --> 00:16:59.156
I just wanna know what happened
to my partner.

215
00:16:59.259 --> 00:17:01.779
Alright. gentlemen.
Let's call it a day.

216
00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:14.999
Very helpful. Jake.
Good luck.

217
00:17:15.103 --> 00:17:16.621
Just hang on. Jake.

218
00:17:16.724 --> 00:17:18.140
Hmm.

219
00:17:22.075 --> 00:17:23.973
Okay. Jake.

220
00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:26.459
This is how this is gonna work.

221
00:17:26.561 --> 00:17:29.600
You're gonna see someone.
A professional.

222
00:17:29.703 --> 00:17:32.085
They're gonna help you
work through your issues.

223
00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:34.122
and then you're gonna
get a new partner

224
00:17:34.225 --> 00:17:37.021
and you're gonna
get back out there.

225
00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:39.575
We'll set up a therapist
for you. You got it?

226
00:17:42.302 --> 00:17:44.580
I wanna see Ace's autopsy.

227
00:17:44.684 --> 00:17:46.893
Yeah. well...

228
00:17:46.996 --> 00:17:49.723
I just want you
to shut the fuck up

229
00:17:49.827 --> 00:17:51.829
and do what you're told.

230
00:17:51.932 --> 00:17:54.935
Those are your options.

231
00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:58.629
Then fire me.
I could care less.

232
00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:02.771
You sleep on that.

233
00:18:12.263 --> 00:18:14.196
- Clown.
- ...fucking circus.

234
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.198
- Yeah.

235
00:18:16.302 --> 00:18:20.064
Easy. Jake. You need
to use the back door.

236
00:18:20.168 --> 00:18:21.686
Come on.

237
00:18:23.688 --> 00:18:25.759
How's the view
from under the bus?

238
00:18:25.863 --> 00:18:30.385
I think they'd prefer a view
in front of a moving train.

239
00:18:30.488 --> 00:18:34.354
Listen. I need to find out
Ace's cause of death.

240
00:18:34.458 --> 00:18:36.805
Sorry. Jake.
I figured it was obvious.

241
00:18:38.462 --> 00:18:41.258
He was a good boy.
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. Thanks.

242
00:18:43.329 --> 00:18:45.814
Just anything peripheral.

243
00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:48.057
I need the closure.

244
00:18:48.161 --> 00:18:50.163
I'll see what I can do.

245
00:19:22.264 --> 00:19:23.679
Unh! Oop. oop. oop. Come on.

246
00:19:23.783 --> 00:19:25.440
Come-- Oh. you got it.
You got it.

247
00:19:25.543 --> 00:19:28.546
What a good dog.
What a good dog you are.

248
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.445
Jake.

249
00:19:30.548 --> 00:19:33.620
Come on.
Can you take over here?

250
00:19:33.724 --> 00:19:35.622
Hey. Good dog.

251
00:19:38.867 --> 00:19:40.662
Okay. Let's go.

252
00:20:30.298 --> 00:20:32.783
Getting a new dog? Fuck.

253
00:20:34.819 --> 00:20:36.338
No.

254
00:20:38.513 --> 00:20:41.550
Unsolicited advice.

255
00:20:41.654 --> 00:20:44.519
Longer you wait.
the harder it gets.

256
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:55.046
Thanks.

257
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.565
Yeah.

258
00:21:03.572 --> 00:21:05.436
- What's up with him?
- Her.

259
00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.163
Last handler
fucked her up but good.

260
00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:11.477
- How so?
- Can't say.

261
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.997
But not because you don't know.

262
00:21:15.101 --> 00:21:18.829
Sealed in some plea deal that
Command wanted to keep quiet.

263
00:21:18.932 --> 00:21:20.934
They didn't give two shits
about Socks. though.

264
00:21:21.038 --> 00:21:23.109
so I took her back.

265
00:21:23.212 --> 00:21:24.697
She's a narcotics animal.

266
00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.183
You want to know
what happened to her?

267
00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:30.012
Use your imagination.

268
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.296
Hey. girl.

269
00:22:40.428 --> 00:22:44.017
Hey. man.
Any of you guys know Dante?

270
00:22:44.121 --> 00:22:45.743
Dante?

271
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.177
Nice tricks. honey.

272
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.149
Might as well nail a badge
to your forehead.

273
00:23:12.252 --> 00:23:14.220
Like a sore thumb. huh?

274
00:23:14.323 --> 00:23:18.500
Baby. you ain't
even close to passing.

275
00:23:18.604 --> 00:23:20.399
That makes two of us.

276
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.652
Know anyone down here
named Dante?

277
00:23:32.756 --> 00:23:34.827
Missing a couple legs?

278
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:38.071
A thousand dudes down here
named Dante.

279
00:23:38.175 --> 00:23:40.660
All missing somethin'.

280
00:23:40.764 --> 00:23:44.043
It's like looking
for a needle in a...

281
00:23:45.734 --> 00:23:48.288
We got a lot of those. too.

282
00:23:48.392 --> 00:23:52.983
Even if I did know. what good
would it be if I tell you?

283
00:23:59.921 --> 00:24:04.132
Face that pretty
in a place like this.

284
00:24:04.235 --> 00:24:05.582
Careful.

285
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.378
Thanks for the smoke. honey.

286
00:24:28.846 --> 00:24:31.331
Hey!
Looking to score. white boy?

287
00:24:31.435 --> 00:24:33.472
- Up against the wall.

288
00:24:33.575 --> 00:24:35.991
- I got him on this side.
- Suspicious white male.

289
00:24:36.095 --> 00:24:38.028
Satanistas was ready
to smoke you. fool.

290
00:24:38.131 --> 00:24:40.237
Yeah. yet you chose
to arrest me.

291
00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.997
They control these streets.

292
00:24:42.101 --> 00:24:43.999
The streets of
downtown Los Angeles?

293
00:24:44.103 --> 00:24:47.520
- Gun!
- Now you're really fucked.

294
00:24:47.624 --> 00:24:50.350
Whoa. whoa. Hold up.

295
00:24:50.454 --> 00:24:53.595
Aren't you the dude on the news
who fucked up that EMT?

296
00:24:53.699 --> 00:24:57.047
Oh. shit.
The one with the dead dog.

297
00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:00.360
Damn. bro.
What are you doing down here?

298
00:25:00.464 --> 00:25:04.192
Errands. You know an informant
down here named Dante?

299
00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:05.676
Aren't you suspended?

300
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.507
You shouldn't
fuck with this clique.

301
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.026
Best to get lost.
- Easy enough.

302
00:25:46.475 --> 00:25:48.892
Hey! You got a dollar?!
Heh-heh!

303
00:25:48.995 --> 00:25:51.308
Hey. I just want
some alcohol. man.

304
00:25:53.724 --> 00:25:56.865
Well. I'll use that.
but. uh. hey.

305
00:26:02.768 --> 00:26:05.564
Thank ya! Thank ya.

306
00:26:05.667 --> 00:26:08.532
Hey. you know a guy
named Dante?

307
00:26:08.636 --> 00:26:10.016
Dante?

308
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.950
Uh. who?
No. but you got a dollar?

309
00:26:13.054 --> 00:26:14.952
You still got a dollar
you can give me?

310
00:26:15.056 --> 00:26:17.437
- Get out of here.

311
00:26:17.541 --> 00:26:20.095
Yeah. I-I just need a dollar
for some alcohol. man.

312
00:26:20.199 --> 00:26:21.856
You got a dollar? Heh!

313
00:26:21.959 --> 00:26:24.721
Come on.
I just need a dollar. man.

314
00:26:24.824 --> 00:26:26.205
Please. man. Just a dollar.

315
00:26:26.308 --> 00:26:29.242
- Please?

316
00:26:29.346 --> 00:26:31.003
Fuck you. man.

317
00:26:34.144 --> 00:26:37.975
...story of an LAPD officer's
shooting caught on camera.

318
00:26:38.079 --> 00:26:40.978
Well. as you can see here
in this cellphone video.

319
00:26:41.082 --> 00:26:43.291
after shooting
and killing a suspect.

320
00:26:43.394 --> 00:26:46.915
Officer Jake Rosser
violently and without warning

321
00:26:47.019 --> 00:26:49.021
assaults paramedic
Gonzalo Robles.

322
00:26:49.124 --> 00:26:51.299
who was treating officers
on the scene.

323
00:26:53.473 --> 00:26:55.234
...reporting live

324
00:26:55.337 --> 00:26:57.581
outside City Hall.
where earlier today

325
00:26:57.685 --> 00:27:00.170
LA Council members
were up in arms

326
00:27:00.273 --> 00:27:01.792
about what they'd seen.

327
00:27:01.896 --> 00:27:04.277
including council member
Priscilla Cross.

328
00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:05.934
who held a press conference.

329
00:27:06.038 --> 00:27:08.972
Police brutality cannot.
will not...

330
00:27:09.075 --> 00:27:12.285
Introducing the middleweight
champ of the world.

331
00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:14.287
Ah. Did you place a bet?

332
00:27:14.391 --> 00:27:17.463
- That's a low blow.
- Yeah.

333
00:27:17.566 --> 00:27:19.085
Watching too much TV lately.

334
00:27:19.189 --> 00:27:20.949
...allocate the city's
law-enforcement budget

335
00:27:21.053 --> 00:27:23.434
to underserved neighborhoods
and low-income housing

336
00:27:23.538 --> 00:27:24.988
for our un-homed Angelinos.

337
00:27:25.091 --> 00:27:26.783
When did the City of Angels
turn to Hell?

338
00:27:26.886 --> 00:27:28.888
You forget
Lucifer was an angel.

339
00:27:28.992 --> 00:27:31.546
We get what we deserve.
I guess.

340
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.929
Yeah. Let's see it.

341
00:27:35.032 --> 00:27:37.172
It's best to keep this shit analog.

342
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.280
You shouldn't have this.

343
00:27:49.391 --> 00:27:51.048
Fentanyl.

344
00:27:55.328 --> 00:27:58.504
Have you seen
anything like that before?

345
00:27:58.607 --> 00:27:59.850
You know I like poker.

346
00:27:59.954 --> 00:28:02.715
- Ramos!
- Yeah. I know it.

347
00:28:02.819 --> 00:28:05.511
It's killed more people in the
past year than the Vietnam War.

348
00:28:05.614 --> 00:28:09.032
I saw that symbol on the street
before Ace got shot.

349
00:28:09.135 --> 00:28:11.551
I need to know more about
the crew producing it.

350
00:28:11.655 --> 00:28:13.346
Jake...

351
00:28:15.038 --> 00:28:17.143
What? Go ahead. Say it.

352
00:28:18.731 --> 00:28:20.733
Thank you.

353
00:28:23.391 --> 00:28:25.358
You're playing a game
when you don't have a team.

354
00:28:25.462 --> 00:28:28.361
Yeah. but they're using some BS
from my past as ransom.

355
00:28:28.465 --> 00:28:32.676
So let 'em!
If it gets you back in the mix.

356
00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.472
See the shrink.

357
00:28:35.575 --> 00:28:38.164
The longer you stick with this
"angry lone wolf" thing.

358
00:28:38.268 --> 00:28:40.719
the longer
you're gonna get iced out.

359
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.621
Do yourself a favor.

360
00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:48.450
Do what lonely people do.

361
00:28:50.763 --> 00:28:52.420
Get a dog.

362
00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:05.640
Leland!

363
00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:06.986
I'm here.

364
00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.126
I wanna pick a new dog.

365
00:29:11.888 --> 00:29:15.305
Socks? Socks is a puzzle.

366
00:29:15.408 --> 00:29:19.343
You need a turnkey.
not a fixer-upper.

367
00:29:19.447 --> 00:29:22.830
Hey. Take it easy.
She's been known to snap.

368
00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:27.317
I know the feeling.

369
00:29:29.457 --> 00:29:31.459
Hey. girl.

370
00:29:31.562 --> 00:29:35.704
Yeah. Hey. Come here.
Let's get this off you.

371
00:29:35.808 --> 00:29:39.363
Yeah. Come on. girl.
Come here.

372
00:29:40.709 --> 00:29:42.711
Uh-huh.

373
00:29:42.815 --> 00:29:47.026
Hey. now. Hey. you.

374
00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.305
Huh? Let me see that.

375
00:29:50.409 --> 00:29:52.307
Titanium.

376
00:29:52.411 --> 00:29:54.896
Lost some teeth
doing whatever that...

377
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.761
son-of-a-bitch handler
had her doing.

378
00:29:57.865 --> 00:29:59.832
He used her
like a blunt instrument.

379
00:29:59.936 --> 00:30:02.041
Not like you would. Jake.

380
00:30:04.561 --> 00:30:06.701
Yeah. she's the one.

381
00:30:09.531 --> 00:30:11.154
So?

382
00:30:15.606 --> 00:30:17.229
Come on.

383
00:30:19.438 --> 00:30:22.303
Come here.
Let's get that off of you.

384
00:30:24.408 --> 00:30:25.513
Yeah.

385
00:30:30.414 --> 00:30:32.589
You hungry?

386
00:30:32.692 --> 00:30:34.556
And I'm not on the menu.

387
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.041
You and me. girl.

388
00:30:36.144 --> 00:30:39.458
We're gonna help each other out.

389
00:30:39.561 --> 00:30:42.633
Nobody will take you on. and
everybody's got me frozen out.

390
00:30:47.328 --> 00:30:49.606
Looks like
you've seen some stuff.

391
00:30:51.988 --> 00:30:53.921
And I've seen some stuff.

392
00:30:54.024 --> 00:30:55.750
There you go. bud.

393
00:30:58.546 --> 00:31:00.789
Let's go. Come on.

394
00:31:19.325 --> 00:31:21.638
Boy. am I hungry.

395
00:31:33.788 --> 00:31:35.583
Thoughts of suicide?

396
00:31:39.276 --> 00:31:41.520
More officers died from suicide

397
00:31:41.623 --> 00:31:45.317
than any other line-of-duty
death this year.

398
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.629
Line-of-duty deaths were down.

399
00:31:47.733 --> 00:31:50.425
not suicides.

400
00:31:50.529 --> 00:31:52.289
That's true.

401
00:31:56.086 --> 00:31:58.157
Suicide is a...

402
00:31:58.261 --> 00:32:00.435
It's a universal idea.

403
00:32:02.403 --> 00:32:05.682
"Suicide." That's a funny word.

404
00:32:05.785 --> 00:32:07.684
German. too. Selbstmord.

405
00:32:11.826 --> 00:32:13.690
To murder oneself.

406
00:32:20.041 --> 00:32:22.492
Have you been
in therapy before?

407
00:32:26.082 --> 00:32:29.464
Would you say
you struggle with anger?

408
00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:32.674
No.

409
00:32:32.778 --> 00:32:35.781
Jake...

410
00:32:35.884 --> 00:32:38.853
You killed a man.

411
00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:42.926
You assaulted a paramedic.

412
00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:45.411
You're a combat veteran.

413
00:32:50.071 --> 00:32:52.522
You asked
if I struggle with it.

414
00:32:54.765 --> 00:32:56.388
I don't.

415
00:32:58.735 --> 00:33:00.840
I let anger win a long time ago.

416
00:33:06.777 --> 00:33:08.641
Are you alone?

417
00:33:19.445 --> 00:33:20.653
Hi.

418
00:33:20.757 --> 00:33:22.517
You want a cup of coffee?

419
00:33:31.871 --> 00:33:34.253
No TV?

420
00:33:34.357 --> 00:33:36.738
I just use the neighbor's
as a radio.

421
00:33:49.061 --> 00:33:51.374
- Can I ask what happened?
- You haven't heard?

422
00:33:51.477 --> 00:33:54.066
No.

423
00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.104
You must be the only one.
The whole town hates me.

424
00:33:57.207 --> 00:33:59.589
Fuck the whole town.

425
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:10.737
It's very nice.

426
00:34:10.841 --> 00:34:12.429
You're not a very good liar.

427
00:34:12.533 --> 00:34:14.224
No.

428
00:34:14.328 --> 00:34:16.433
I'm not a good liar.

429
00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:20.817
That's a good thing.

430
00:34:22.888 --> 00:34:25.304
So...

431
00:34:25.408 --> 00:34:28.549
do you ever do anything for fun?

432
00:34:28.652 --> 00:34:31.759
Besides read?

433
00:34:31.862 --> 00:34:33.726
Sometimes I watch movies.

434
00:34:36.143 --> 00:34:37.730
Where?

435
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:43.322
You have a nice smile.

436
00:34:43.426 --> 00:34:46.152
Something tells me
sightings of it are rare.

437
00:34:52.952 --> 00:34:54.540
You keep it all in.

438
00:34:57.819 --> 00:34:59.476
It's okay.

439
00:35:10.625 --> 00:35:14.422
She begs when I don't give her
what she wants.

440
00:35:14.526 --> 00:35:16.562
She knows you'll give in.

441
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:32.923
So. we did break
some records yesterday.

442
00:35:33.027 --> 00:35:36.548
You know. LAX. Long Beach
Anaheim all broke records.

443
00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:38.895
We saw temperatures
topping out into the 90s

444
00:35:38.998 --> 00:35:40.414
for a lot of these places.

445
00:35:40.517 --> 00:35:42.347
Things are finally
gonna start to cool down

446
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.039
because we still have these
lingering offshore winds.

447
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.765
but those winds
are slowly weakening.

448
00:35:48.284 --> 00:35:50.009
Alright. Let's go.

449
00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:57.569
Hey.

450
00:36:11.272 --> 00:36:13.378
Every morning.
Every fucking morning!

451
00:36:13.481 --> 00:36:15.863
Pay me my fucking toll!

452
00:36:15.966 --> 00:36:18.797
Pay me my fucking toll!

453
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.971
Hey! Hey!

454
00:36:21.075 --> 00:36:23.422
Hey. Your dog looks burnt-out!

455
00:36:29.808 --> 00:36:31.534
For some of you.
it's your first day.

456
00:36:31.637 --> 00:36:33.984
For others. it's a refresher.

457
00:36:34.088 --> 00:36:37.091
Keep in mind. there's always
something new to learn.

458
00:36:39.921 --> 00:36:43.649
Handling is intuitive. right?
It's about instinct.

459
00:36:43.753 --> 00:36:47.964
The dog's instincts.
but your instincts. as well.

460
00:36:48.067 --> 00:36:49.724
Now. these dogs. your dog.

461
00:36:49.828 --> 00:36:52.520
they can run faster than you.
hear better.

462
00:36:52.624 --> 00:36:57.422
smell better.
react quicker than you can.

463
00:36:57.525 --> 00:36:59.803
And they will read

464
00:36:59.907 --> 00:37:03.048
every little suggestion
that you make to them.

465
00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:04.705
Hopp. hopp. hopp.

466
00:37:04.808 --> 00:37:08.295
Your dog will become
completely addicted to you.

467
00:37:08.398 --> 00:37:10.193
Don't abuse that power.

468
00:37:10.297 --> 00:37:13.921
There's one thing
your dog can't do.

469
00:37:14.024 --> 00:37:18.132
Your dog can't think ahead.

470
00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:20.099
Look. Bottom line is...

471
00:37:20.203 --> 00:37:23.724
if you keep your dog safe.
your dog will keep you safe.

472
00:37:23.827 --> 00:37:25.243
So...

473
00:37:25.346 --> 00:37:27.590
let's get back to basics. uh...

474
00:37:27.693 --> 00:37:30.386
a few confidence builders. yeah?

475
00:37:31.732 --> 00:37:33.320
Socks. Hier.

476
00:37:36.978 --> 00:37:38.566
Socks. Platz.

477
00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.328
Platz.

478
00:37:41.431 --> 00:37:42.467
- She ain't listening to him.

479
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.400
Socks. platz.
Come on. girl.

480
00:37:44.503 --> 00:37:47.506
Come on. girl.
Socks. hier.

481
00:37:51.924 --> 00:37:53.340
Socks.

482
00:37:59.138 --> 00:38:01.865
She doesn't listen
to a word I say.

483
00:38:01.969 --> 00:38:05.006
Hmm. Well...

484
00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:08.665
Maybe it's got nothing to do
with what you're saying.

485
00:38:12.324 --> 00:38:13.843
Here he goes again.

486
00:38:17.156 --> 00:38:18.986
Socks. hier.

487
00:38:21.126 --> 00:38:23.611
Socks. platz.

488
00:38:23.715 --> 00:38:26.027
Platz.

489
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:27.201
Socks. platz.

490
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.103
Hey. Socks.
Come here. Platz.

491
00:38:33.207 --> 00:38:35.278
Sit. Sitz.

492
00:38:35.382 --> 00:38:38.799
Hey. Socks.
You're killing me. Socks.

493
00:38:38.902 --> 00:38:41.905
Look. What am I telling you
that I'm not saying?

494
00:38:42.009 --> 00:38:43.838
Huh? Yeah.

495
00:38:43.942 --> 00:38:45.875
Look. I know
I seem bitter and angry.

496
00:38:45.978 --> 00:38:47.428
but I'm not mad at you.

497
00:38:47.532 --> 00:38:49.499
No. it's just--
since I've been back--

498
00:38:49.603 --> 00:38:51.984
It's a long story.
I'll tell you some other time.

499
00:38:52.088 --> 00:38:54.504
You know I can't magically
drop all this shit

500
00:38:54.608 --> 00:38:55.954
and be as easygoing as you.
just like that.

501
00:38:57.162 --> 00:39:00.199
Hey! Whoa!

502
00:39:00.303 --> 00:39:02.409
Ho-ho!

503
00:39:02.512 --> 00:39:04.031
Hey. hey. hey!

504
00:39:04.134 --> 00:39:07.068
There you go. Congratulations.

505
00:39:07.172 --> 00:39:10.071
You flunked first grade.
but you passed second and third.

506
00:39:12.108 --> 00:39:13.937
Good girl. Good girl.

507
00:39:40.757 --> 00:39:43.450
My dad drank coffee
at night. too.

508
00:39:45.072 --> 00:39:49.179
He drank coffee to go to bed. literally.

509
00:39:49.283 --> 00:39:52.907
He drank a cup of coffee
before bed every night to relax.

510
00:39:59.466 --> 00:40:02.400
Do you drink
anything besides coffee?

511
00:40:02.503 --> 00:40:04.332
I try not to.

512
00:40:14.446 --> 00:40:16.897
You're seeing someone.

513
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.174
Hey. beautiful.

514
00:40:18.277 --> 00:40:19.658
I am.

515
00:40:21.488 --> 00:40:24.111
Human connection is crucial.

516
00:40:30.289 --> 00:40:33.465
Any anger issues lately?

517
00:40:33.569 --> 00:40:35.260
None whatsoever.

518
00:40:38.505 --> 00:40:40.955
And your former partner?

519
00:40:41.059 --> 00:40:43.751
How are you managing
those feelings?

520
00:40:45.788 --> 00:40:48.480
Well. I'm-- I'm...

521
00:40:48.584 --> 00:40:50.827
learning to let go.

522
00:41:02.252 --> 00:41:04.013
I need keys to my vehicle.

523
00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:11.986
You're not on the roster.

524
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:15.162
I-- I left his collar
in the car.

525
00:41:17.613 --> 00:41:19.200
- Oh. fuck. man.
- Hey.

526
00:41:19.304 --> 00:41:21.030
I'm sorry.

527
00:41:25.448 --> 00:41:27.001
Thank you.

528
00:41:54.719 --> 00:41:57.031

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:30.271
Dante. why am I hearing
that you're getting kidnapped?

538
00:42:30.375 --> 00:42:33.136
Hmm? Who's fucking with you?
Huh?

539
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.519
Is that true?
Have you been getting kidnapped?

540
00:42:36.623 --> 00:42:38.107
Dante. I need a name.

541
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:39.833
211 in progress.
800 block of Maple.

542
00:42:39.936 --> 00:42:41.386
Repeat. 800 block of Maple.

543
00:42:41.489 --> 00:42:43.043
Units in the area.
please respond.

544
00:42:43.146 --> 00:42:46.978
Yo. we gotta roll.

545
00:42:47.081 --> 00:42:49.256
Be safe.

546
00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:51.396
What's up. dawg?

547
00:43:11.002 --> 00:43:13.245
- Dante!
- What's up. dawg?

548
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:14.522
What's it doing. man?

549
00:43:14.626 --> 00:43:16.766
- Oh. shit.

550
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:19.424
Hey. man. Chill out.
I'm not here to hassle you.

551
00:43:21.702 --> 00:43:23.601
Don't worry about her.
She's not coming out.

552
00:43:23.704 --> 00:43:25.533
You know about everything
that's going around

553
00:43:25.637 --> 00:43:27.018
on these streets. don't ya?

554
00:43:27.121 --> 00:43:28.882
You see everything. don't ya?

555
00:43:28.985 --> 00:43:30.884
- Hey. man. listen to me.

556
00:43:30.987 --> 00:43:33.818
Listen to me.
I need you to talk to me. okay?

557
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.824
I know her.

558
00:43:39.927 --> 00:43:41.584
- No. you don't.
- I know her.

559
00:43:41.688 --> 00:43:43.344
No. man. That's a new dog.

560
00:43:43.448 --> 00:43:45.692
But you know a lot. don't ya?
What else can you tell me?

561
00:43:45.795 --> 00:43:47.555
I'm trying to find out
who killed the last one.

562
00:43:47.659 --> 00:43:49.488
Ask you a few questions?

563
00:43:49.592 --> 00:43:51.145
I'm good.

564
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.873
I'll be right back. alright?

565
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.390
Mmm! Mmm!

566
00:44:29.494 --> 00:44:33.015
I just need you to answer a few
simple questions. alright?

567
00:44:52.759 --> 00:44:54.312
Come on. man.
I'm not squeezing you.

568
00:44:54.415 --> 00:44:56.555
I just need a name.

569
00:44:56.659 --> 00:44:58.557
I don't know nothin'
about nothin'.

570
00:45:05.323 --> 00:45:07.981
Who's calling shots
for the Satanistas?

571
00:45:11.225 --> 00:45:12.399
Hmm?

572
00:45:16.058 --> 00:45:18.577
China.

573
00:45:18.681 --> 00:45:20.821
Dirty secrets.

574
00:45:20.925 --> 00:45:22.650
Hidden in plain sight.

575
00:45:24.929 --> 00:45:29.623
Nobody gives a fuck
'cause it feels so good.

576
00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:31.659
They don't make it
to this side of town.

577
00:45:31.763 --> 00:45:33.938
Huh? What side of town?

578
00:45:34.041 --> 00:45:36.112
Town. One side of the world.

579
00:45:38.839 --> 00:45:40.496
- I thought she was a ghost.

580
00:45:40.599 --> 00:45:42.256
But you ain't him.

581
00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.535
What are you talking about?
You know my dog?

582
00:45:45.639 --> 00:45:48.228
- I remember.
- No. Dante.

583
00:45:48.331 --> 00:45:50.437
I just told you.
That's my new dog.

584
00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:51.679
You don't remember?

585
00:45:51.783 --> 00:45:53.923
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

586
00:45:54.027 --> 00:45:56.443
You don't remember enough.

587
00:45:56.546 --> 00:45:58.928
I remember too much.

588
00:45:59.032 --> 00:46:02.242
Alright. Dante.
Stay out of the sun. okay?

589
00:46:02.345 --> 00:46:03.864
Yeah.

590
00:46:03.968 --> 00:46:05.797
Leave him alone!

591
00:46:14.495 --> 00:46:16.118
Preach to the choir.

592
00:46:27.715 --> 00:46:29.476
- What's up. dawg?
- Hey.

593
00:46:34.722 --> 00:46:36.828
Jesus!

594
00:46:36.932 --> 00:46:39.003
I see you made a new friend.

595
00:46:39.106 --> 00:46:41.695
Yeah.
Good advice is good advice.

596
00:46:41.799 --> 00:46:44.111
Regardless of who gives it.

597
00:46:44.215 --> 00:46:46.044
Why do they call it "China"?

598
00:46:46.148 --> 00:46:47.839
'Cause that's where it's from.

599
00:46:47.943 --> 00:46:51.360
Along with everything else. now
you have synthetic opioids. too.

600
00:46:51.463 --> 00:46:54.294
Right.

601
00:46:54.397 --> 00:46:58.160
Jake. What do you want?

602
00:46:58.263 --> 00:47:01.749
Vehicle registration.
The car that blew up.

603
00:47:08.239 --> 00:47:10.482
I haven't forgotten
what you did for me.

604
00:47:12.484 --> 00:47:14.762
And you've kept it on the DL
like you promised.

605
00:47:14.866 --> 00:47:17.075
Ramos. drop it.

606
00:47:17.179 --> 00:47:18.697
Don't make me feel guilty.

607
00:47:18.801 --> 00:47:20.768
You're doing that
all by yourself.

608
00:47:20.872 --> 00:47:23.357
Yeah. knowing that I'm the root
of my own problems doesn't help.

609
00:47:23.461 --> 00:47:26.429
You gambled a little.
It's no big deal.

610
00:47:26.533 --> 00:47:28.431
It was only a three-hour drive
to pick you up.

611
00:47:28.535 --> 00:47:30.813
Yeah. while my daughter
was at home alone.

612
00:47:30.917 --> 00:47:33.195
Okay. You win. You owe me.

613
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.372
How do you feel?

614
00:47:38.476 --> 00:47:40.236
Better.

615
00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:42.480
You're not just saying that.
are you?

616
00:47:42.583 --> 00:47:43.791
No. why would I do that?

617
00:47:45.103 --> 00:47:47.312
No.

618
00:47:47.416 --> 00:47:52.076
So I would sign off here
and say you're good to go.

619
00:47:52.179 --> 00:47:54.078
Healthy as a horse.

620
00:47:59.566 --> 00:48:01.533
I'd like to believe that...

621
00:48:03.535 --> 00:48:07.091
...that you've actually
thought about the things

622
00:48:07.194 --> 00:48:09.196
that you've been through. Jake.

623
00:48:22.002 --> 00:48:23.831
You like art?

624
00:48:23.935 --> 00:48:26.420
Sure. Do you?

625
00:48:26.524 --> 00:48:30.666
I do. I do.

626
00:48:30.769 --> 00:48:32.150
I think it's...

627
00:48:34.428 --> 00:48:36.154
...what we do
to remind ourselves

628
00:48:36.258 --> 00:48:39.054
that we can. you know.

629
00:48:39.157 --> 00:48:41.919
escape the swamp
of being an animal.

630
00:48:44.818 --> 00:48:46.682
There's a lot of truth in that.

631
00:48:46.785 --> 00:48:51.480
I've seen how creative
people can be in the art of...

632
00:48:51.583 --> 00:48:53.378
combat. killing...

633
00:48:57.865 --> 00:49:01.145
...and things
outright ingenious...

634
00:49:01.248 --> 00:49:03.423
and the destruction
of innocence.

635
00:49:07.634 --> 00:49:11.638
Used to signal to people
with any shred of virtue...

636
00:49:16.505 --> 00:49:19.301
...that you won't win
by being the bigger person.

637
00:49:22.545 --> 00:49:26.618
That causes you
to reject people.

638
00:49:26.722 --> 00:49:29.000
Because you know...

639
00:49:29.104 --> 00:49:32.107
more than most...

640
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:34.833
we can never escape
being animals.

641
00:49:42.876 --> 00:49:44.602
More or less.

642
00:50:04.898 --> 00:50:08.074
Xiang Xi. Xiang Xi.

643
00:50:08.177 --> 00:50:10.110
2806 Pinecrest.

644
00:50:10.214 --> 00:50:12.078
Just another stolen car. Jake.

645
00:50:12.181 --> 00:50:14.287
That's it. We're square.

646
00:50:27.645 --> 00:50:30.234
You ready to get
back out there?

647
00:50:30.337 --> 00:50:31.614
Hmm?

648
00:50:34.169 --> 00:50:37.551
Hey. Don't let me
blow it today. okay?

649
00:50:41.693 --> 00:50:44.593
Well. let's see how long
it takes before she quits.

650
00:50:47.113 --> 00:50:48.976
You show 'em. girl.

651
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.323
Such!

652
00:51:07.754 --> 00:51:10.136
Oh. Hey!

653
00:51:13.104 --> 00:51:16.073
Whoa. ho. ho! Hey!

654
00:51:16.176 --> 00:51:18.489
That dog moved
the whole damn tire!

655
00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.841
Come here. Thatagirl.
Thatagirl! Come on.

656
00:51:41.132 --> 00:51:42.996
Socks. Ablegen.

657
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.756
Come here. Socks...

658
00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.551
- Good girl.

659
00:51:46.655 --> 00:51:50.693
Oh. yeah! Good girl!
Good girl! Thatagirl.

660
00:51:50.797 --> 00:51:52.695
I'd say!

661
00:51:57.907 --> 00:52:00.462
Whew!

662
00:52:00.565 --> 00:52:03.361
I knew I smelled something.

663
00:52:03.465 --> 00:52:05.708
They got you walking
a new dog. Rosser?

664
00:52:05.812 --> 00:52:08.228
Hernandez. how the hell
were you ever a sniper

665
00:52:08.332 --> 00:52:10.196
if you can't shut the fuck up?

666
00:52:10.299 --> 00:52:12.853
Hey. I'm just
making conversation.

667
00:52:12.957 --> 00:52:15.028
Which reminds me.

668
00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:16.409
You didn't happen to. uh.

669
00:52:16.512 --> 00:52:19.308
roll up on my man Dante.
did you?

670
00:52:19.412 --> 00:52:20.792
I know it was you.

671
00:52:20.896 --> 00:52:23.036
You shake down
an informant of mine again

672
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.245
without talking to me first.

673
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:27.661
I swear to God.
I will fuck you up.

674
00:52:31.044 --> 00:52:34.289
Get that bitch under control.

675
00:52:34.392 --> 00:52:36.532
Socks. platz.

676
00:52:38.431 --> 00:52:42.124
You know something. Rosser?

677
00:52:42.228 --> 00:52:44.091
I'm starting to like her.

678
00:52:44.195 --> 00:52:46.163
She got bigger balls than you.

679
00:52:54.136 --> 00:52:56.242
- Welcome back. Jake.
- Thanks. Parnell.

680
00:52:58.692 --> 00:53:03.007
Hey. Sarge?
How about you put me on 8?

681
00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:05.492
- The Spa? You. Rosser?
- Yeah. I think it would be good

682
00:53:05.596 --> 00:53:07.874
for us to work our way
back in. you know?

683
00:53:07.977 --> 00:53:10.773
Like a warm-up.
- Okay.

684
00:53:10.877 --> 00:53:14.121
Not a lot of guys would show
that type of humility.

685
00:53:14.225 --> 00:53:17.124
- Thanks.
- It wasn't a compliment.

686
00:53:34.072 --> 00:53:38.145
Come on. Let's go.
You gotta sit up here with me.

687
00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.081
Seriously?

688
00:53:43.185 --> 00:53:45.360
Hey. Fetch!

689
00:53:45.463 --> 00:53:47.707
See you later. putobitch!

690
00:53:58.683 --> 00:54:01.134
That's ridiculous. Did you
tell Larry to lock the door?

691
00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:02.825
- Yeah.
- See that. Socks?

692
00:54:02.929 --> 00:54:05.207
They talk to themselves
over here. too.

693
00:54:10.005 --> 00:54:11.593
I knew a...

694
00:54:45.903 --> 00:54:48.043
- ABD Security.
- Hey. How you doing?

695
00:54:48.146 --> 00:54:50.459
Uh. this is Officer Rosser. LAPD.

696
00:54:50.563 --> 00:54:52.910
- How can I help you?
- Was driving by and saw

697
00:54:53.013 --> 00:54:55.222
a possible sign of forced entry
at one of your locations.

698
00:54:55.326 --> 00:54:56.362
Which location?

699
00:54:56.465 --> 00:54:58.433
2806 Pinecrest.

700
00:54:58.536 --> 00:54:59.917
Do you have
an emergency to report?

701
00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.644
- Is your system active?
- System looks good.

702
00:55:02.747 --> 00:55:04.370
Yeah. yeah.
You should test it.

703
00:55:04.473 --> 00:55:05.957
No problem.

704
00:55:14.276 --> 00:55:17.797
Possible burglary.
2806 Pinecrest.

705
00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:20.075
This is King 8.
I'm in the vicinity.

706
00:55:20.178 --> 00:55:21.041
Show me en route.

707
00:55:21.145 --> 00:55:22.698
10-4.

708
00:56:15.717 --> 00:56:17.512
King 8.
Sounds inside the residence.

709
00:56:17.615 --> 00:56:19.859
Going to investigate.
- 10-4. Requesting backup?

710
00:56:19.962 --> 00:56:21.239
Negative.

711
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:12.118
Platz.

712
00:57:29.584 --> 00:57:31.758
Socks. here! Socks!

713
00:57:37.868 --> 00:57:39.076
Socks!

714
00:57:51.398 --> 00:57:52.779
Socks.

715
00:58:11.418 --> 00:58:14.145
Hey.
Boy. where'd you come from?

716
00:58:14.249 --> 00:58:15.353
Faas!

717
00:59:12.203 --> 00:59:16.691
How did you manage this?
You don't have a scratch on you.

718
00:59:16.794 --> 00:59:18.347
- Breaking news.
- Ugh! Thanks!

719
00:59:18.451 --> 00:59:21.661
Another deadly incident
involving an LAPD officer

720
00:59:21.765 --> 00:59:24.043
in Bel-Air
has local residents reeling

721
00:59:24.146 --> 00:59:28.288
and LAPD bracing for social
pushback. turmoil. unrest.

722
00:59:28.392 --> 00:59:29.911
pressure from the commu--

723
00:59:33.224 --> 00:59:34.743
Hey. Cut it out.

724
00:59:39.783 --> 00:59:41.578
What? You have to pee again?

725
00:59:44.408 --> 00:59:47.653
What? Food?

726
00:59:57.145 --> 00:59:59.526
This? Is this
what you're looking at?

727
00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:02.115
Hey. girl. Oh. oh. Come here.

728
01:00:04.566 --> 01:00:06.948
There's something
you're not telling me.

729
01:00:35.355 --> 01:00:37.081
Made in China.

730
01:01:10.149 --> 01:01:11.806
Do you think you have a thing
for heat?

731
01:01:11.909 --> 01:01:13.980
Or are you just
really fuckin' lucky?

732
01:01:14.084 --> 01:01:18.951
Sir. I was in Bel-Air.
The Spa. How could I have known?

733
01:01:19.054 --> 01:01:20.711
You know.
that's a really good question.

734
01:01:20.815 --> 01:01:24.853
Ramos. how could Rosser here
have known?

735
01:01:24.957 --> 01:01:26.613
- I'm sorry?
- Are you?

736
01:01:28.892 --> 01:01:31.757
I've only got
one other report here

737
01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.036
with that address in Bel-Air.

738
01:01:35.139 --> 01:01:38.349
And you know
whose name is on it.

739
01:01:38.453 --> 01:01:42.319
We cased the house a few years
ago. but nothing materialized.

740
01:01:42.422 --> 01:01:45.115
Sure as fuck has
materialized now. hasn't it?

741
01:01:45.218 --> 01:01:47.220
Do you have any idea
how much fucking grief

742
01:01:47.324 --> 01:01:49.775
I'm getting
because we busted a meth lab

743
01:01:49.878 --> 01:01:52.225
in the middle of
Bel fucking Air?

744
01:01:52.329 --> 01:01:54.469
You know who lives
in that neighborhood?!

745
01:01:54.572 --> 01:01:56.298
Not meth. sir. Fentanyl.

746
01:01:56.402 --> 01:01:58.369
They sweat it down
for street product and--

747
01:01:58.473 --> 01:02:00.061
Oh. shut the fuck up. Ramos.

748
01:02:00.164 --> 01:02:03.064
I called you in here
so that you could thank Rosser

749
01:02:03.167 --> 01:02:06.515
for finishing the job
that you couldn't do.

750
01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:08.172
So. go ahead.

751
01:02:08.276 --> 01:02:10.381
Tell him how you sent
in the human torpedo here.

752
01:02:10.485 --> 01:02:14.351
the guy with all the issues.
to do the job you couldn't!

753
01:02:14.454 --> 01:02:16.008
Jake. look. I--

754
01:02:16.111 --> 01:02:18.355
I don't know if you assholes
have heard this.

755
01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:21.910
but the mob has its boot
on the throat of City Hall.

756
01:02:22.014 --> 01:02:23.981
We are getting gutted.

757
01:02:24.085 --> 01:02:28.814
and I'm looking at two
prime reasons why right here!

758
01:02:28.917 --> 01:02:30.954
Now get the fuck out!

759
01:02:34.233 --> 01:02:36.338
You do the job
I tell you to do. Ramos.

760
01:02:36.442 --> 01:02:38.858
You don't get to just make up
the rules as you go along.

761
01:02:38.962 --> 01:02:40.895
- Come on.
- And. you...

762
01:02:40.998 --> 01:02:42.966
You get to go back to therapy.

763
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:45.313
What. you shot one guy
and you stabbed another.

764
01:02:45.416 --> 01:02:48.281
What the hell are you
gonna think of next?

765
01:02:48.385 --> 01:02:50.697
Oh. I'm sure
I'll think of something.

766
01:02:58.533 --> 01:03:01.191
Jake. Listen.

767
01:03:01.294 --> 01:03:04.815
Ramos. take it easy.
What? You got a nice seizure.

768
01:03:04.919 --> 01:03:06.541
and I got one of the guys
that killed my dog.

769
01:03:08.405 --> 01:03:10.579
Sitz.

770
01:03:10.683 --> 01:03:13.824
He spoke German.
Like the other guy.

771
01:03:13.928 --> 01:03:15.446
I need to know
what that's about.

772
01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:17.103
I don't know.

773
01:03:17.207 --> 01:03:20.451
Find out who handled Socks
before me. It's at S.I.U.

774
01:03:20.555 --> 01:03:23.627
Could be a grand-jury
indictment. sealed.

775
01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:25.491
- It's not gonna happen.
- Come on. Ramos.

776
01:03:25.594 --> 01:03:28.943
you're a good detective.
I know you can figure it out.

777
01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:37.952
Hey!

778
01:03:38.055 --> 01:03:40.678
Hey. Jake. Where you going?

779
01:03:40.782 --> 01:03:42.508
Going for a walk.

780
01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:44.475
Do you wanna watch a movie
when you get back?

781
01:03:44.579 --> 01:03:45.960
I can't tonight. babe.

782
01:03:46.063 --> 01:03:48.617
I'm gotta go take care
of something.

783
01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:51.137
Alright. Be safe.

784
01:03:55.935 --> 01:03:57.385
Come on.

785
01:04:21.927 --> 01:04:23.963
What's going on. Socks?

786
01:04:25.792 --> 01:04:27.622
Huh?

787
01:04:30.659 --> 01:04:32.178
I told you not to come.

788
01:04:47.331 --> 01:04:48.954
Hey. hey. No.

789
01:04:49.057 --> 01:04:51.197
Shh. Hey. You no get us killed.

790
01:04:51.301 --> 01:04:52.923
Shh!

791
01:04:54.821 --> 01:04:57.169
You're a complicated dog.
You know that?

792
01:04:57.272 --> 01:05:00.103
You think too much
for your own good.

793
01:05:00.206 --> 01:05:01.656
Come on. Let's go.

794
01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:05.867
Let's go.

795
01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.614
Turn around. Slowly.

796
01:07:15.238 --> 01:07:16.998
Hey! Turn around!

797
01:07:17.102 --> 01:07:18.655
Stay where you are.

798
01:07:26.663 --> 01:07:28.423
Who do you work for?

799
01:07:30.356 --> 01:07:32.462
- Nobody.
- Take off your mask.

800
01:07:43.404 --> 01:07:45.820
I thought Socks was dead.

801
01:07:45.923 --> 01:07:48.167
- What'd you say?
- Where's Santiago?

802
01:07:48.271 --> 01:07:50.756
Who's Santiago?
Who-- Who are you?

803
01:07:50.859 --> 01:07:54.173
- Who's Santiago?!
- Alright. Come on. Careful.

804
01:07:54.277 --> 01:07:56.934
One drop of this.
and you're a goner.

805
01:07:57.038 --> 01:07:58.522
Who's Santiago?!

806
01:08:06.599 --> 01:08:08.670
Socks. ablegen.

807
01:08:16.299 --> 01:08:18.508
Socks. faas!

808
01:08:18.611 --> 01:08:19.888
Nein.

809
01:08:21.752 --> 01:08:24.134
Faas!

810
01:08:24.237 --> 01:08:25.962
Toeten.

811
01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:37.251
You brought her back to me.

812
01:08:39.011 --> 01:08:41.047
Socks. hier.

813
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:42.911
Nein.

814
01:08:57.478 --> 01:08:59.652
It's time to choose.

815
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:05.348
There is our side...
or suicide.

816
01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:08.729
You'll bring me more dogs.

817
01:09:08.834 --> 01:09:10.491
I'm not dirty.

818
01:09:14.736 --> 01:09:15.702
I know you.

819
01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:20.225
I know you're an animal.

820
01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:38.993
You using again?

821
01:10:41.719 --> 01:10:43.860
The stress of this job
can be a lot.

822
01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:47.795
What is this?

823
01:10:47.898 --> 01:10:51.592
This... is the third incident
in a month.

824
01:10:53.352 --> 01:10:55.492
They took my dog.

825
01:10:55.596 --> 01:10:59.565
- Who?
- The Satanistas.

826
01:11:01.532 --> 01:11:03.535
They got a paint factory
in Vernon.

827
01:11:03.638 --> 01:11:07.539
where they cut fentanyl.
like the place in Bel-Air.

828
01:11:07.642 --> 01:11:11.059
They killed Ace and took Socks.

829
01:11:11.163 --> 01:11:12.544
Xiang Xi.

830
01:11:12.647 --> 01:11:15.754
EXIS Therapeutics. Look it up.

831
01:11:15.857 --> 01:11:18.826
Yeah. we'll get
right on that. Jake.

832
01:11:18.929 --> 01:11:20.690
But what we need to decide
right now

833
01:11:20.793 --> 01:11:22.623
is whether your
substance-abuse problem

834
01:11:22.726 --> 01:11:25.384
is something we need to
be concerned about.

835
01:11:25.487 --> 01:11:27.523
I don't know. Maybe it's been
brought on by your PTSD?

836
01:11:27.628 --> 01:11:29.526
- I was drugged.
- Well. it wouldn't be

837
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:32.391
the first time.
according to your file.

838
01:11:32.495 --> 01:11:34.324
Jake. what
he's trying to say...

839
01:11:34.428 --> 01:11:35.946
What I'm trying to say is.

840
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:39.916
we think it's time for you
to take a break.

841
01:11:40.019 --> 01:11:41.469
A long one.

842
01:11:59.418 --> 01:12:02.800
Hey. Rosser! Hop in. man.

843
01:12:02.904 --> 01:12:04.389
I'm good.

844
01:12:04.492 --> 01:12:07.840
No. Seriously. Jake.

845
01:12:07.943 --> 01:12:09.532
Get in.

846
01:12:19.887 --> 01:12:22.234
They're sweeping the underpass
for Socks' body.

847
01:12:24.823 --> 01:12:27.170
A waste of time.

848
01:12:27.273 --> 01:12:29.621
I know.

849
01:12:29.724 --> 01:12:33.452
I don't believe
that S.I.U. bullshit.

850
01:12:33.556 --> 01:12:35.903
I know they got your partner.

851
01:12:37.559 --> 01:12:40.804
Who told you that?

852
01:12:40.907 --> 01:12:42.496
Ramos?

853
01:12:47.121 --> 01:12:48.847
Why the fuck do you care?

854
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:53.264
If they fuck with your partner
and they fuck with you...

855
01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:55.094
they fuck with me.

856
01:12:58.443 --> 01:13:01.755
Find Socks. brother.

857
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:05.346
And when you do.
we're gonna hit 'em so hard

858
01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:08.142
they'll be shitting
blood and fucking teeth.

859
01:13:27.989 --> 01:13:30.267
- What are you doing?
- I'm going away for a while.

860
01:13:30.371 --> 01:13:32.407
What are you talking about?

861
01:13:36.204 --> 01:13:37.758
You know. you do this stoic.

862
01:13:37.861 --> 01:13:41.244
"I can handle my shit" thing.
but open your eyes.

863
01:13:41.347 --> 01:13:42.693
You keep so much bottled up.

864
01:13:42.797 --> 01:13:44.281
you're blowing up
everything around you.

865
01:13:44.385 --> 01:13:45.835
You're probably right. Yeah.

866
01:13:45.938 --> 01:13:47.250
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

867
01:13:47.353 --> 01:13:48.562
I'm agreeing with you.

868
01:13:48.665 --> 01:13:50.046
So you don't
have to argue with me.

869
01:13:50.148 --> 01:13:51.634
That is not the same thing.

870
01:13:51.737 --> 01:13:53.014
Mia. this is the last thing
that I need right now.

871
01:13:53.118 --> 01:13:54.430
But it was the first thing

872
01:13:54.532 --> 01:13:55.879
when you wanted
to get back on the job?

873
01:13:55.983 --> 01:13:58.710
Your friends from
the Special Investigations Unit.

874
01:13:58.813 --> 01:14:01.575
Officer Reed and Hasting.
came by the hospital.

875
01:14:01.678 --> 01:14:04.059
They mentioned you needed
to look normal. stable...

876
01:14:04.163 --> 01:14:06.303
so your shrink would sign
your permission slip.

877
01:14:06.407 --> 01:14:09.202
That has nothing
to do with this.

878
01:14:09.306 --> 01:14:11.067
The fucked-up thing...

879
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:13.414
I actually would have been
okay with that...

880
01:14:13.518 --> 01:14:16.175
if it wasn't for
everything else.

881
01:14:16.279 --> 01:14:18.419
Look.

882
01:14:18.523 --> 01:14:23.286
I don't know
what happened to Socks. but...

883
01:14:23.389 --> 01:14:25.046
I hope she's okay.

884
01:14:35.712 --> 01:14:37.990
Thoughts of suicide. Jake?

885
01:14:48.276 --> 01:14:49.933
No.

886
01:15:22.103 --> 01:15:25.590
Hey. I told you to
stay off my fucking bridge.

887
01:15:25.693 --> 01:15:29.421
This is my bridge! It's mine!

888
01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:32.182
Get off my fucking bridge!

889
01:15:32.286 --> 01:15:35.151
You pay me my fucking toll.

890
01:15:35.254 --> 01:15:37.429
Pay me my fucking toll!

891
01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.406
Shit. Shit.

892
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:53.169
Nice! Nice!

893
01:15:53.272 --> 01:15:55.343
Hey! Where's your dog?

894
01:15:57.862 --> 01:16:00.107
Hey. where's your fucking dog?!

895
01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.831
Just ran out of road.

896
01:16:37.178 --> 01:16:39.146
Listen. Jake.

897
01:16:39.249 --> 01:16:43.150
I know a guy
if you're looking for work.

898
01:16:43.253 --> 01:16:45.911
Luis' Lumber in Tehachapi.

899
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:53.298
Look him up.
Luis in Tehachapi.

900
01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:56.197
If you're looking. For work.

901
01:17:02.478 --> 01:17:04.273
There's always more road.

902
01:18:00.227 --> 01:18:02.056
...weather together
on the fives

903
01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.713
as we head
into the holiday weekend.

904
01:18:03.817 --> 01:18:05.577
It's gonna be a spicy
Fourth of July.

905
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.752
High temperatures into
the upper 90s in the Valley.

906
01:18:07.855 --> 01:18:09.512
80s at the beaches.

907
01:18:09.615 --> 01:18:11.996
Let's go live to Bella Ericson
in our traffic...

908
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:53.521
Santiago.

909
01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.871
What did you just call me?

910
01:18:57.974 --> 01:18:59.562
You heard me.

911
01:18:59.665 --> 01:19:01.288
You got the wrong guy.

912
01:19:03.566 --> 01:19:06.603
It's about Socks.

913
01:19:06.707 --> 01:19:09.606
I don't wear any.

914
01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:12.886
So get off my fucking property.

915
01:19:12.989 --> 01:19:15.129
If you're still here
by the time I get back.

916
01:19:15.233 --> 01:19:16.821
I'm gonna cut you
in fuckin' half.

917
01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:19.099
You're not gonna do that.

918
01:19:19.202 --> 01:19:22.032
You won't because you don't
want them finding you.

919
01:19:22.136 --> 01:19:23.759
Who?

920
01:19:23.862 --> 01:19:26.209
The people who took our dog.

921
01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:31.594
Let's get a cup of coffee.

922
01:19:31.697 --> 01:19:34.389
I don't drink any.

923
01:19:34.493 --> 01:19:36.495
I gotta work.

924
01:19:38.635 --> 01:19:42.225
You wanna talk to me?

925
01:19:42.329 --> 01:19:43.986
Tag along.

926
01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:53.892
My indictment
is still under seal.

927
01:19:53.996 --> 01:19:56.170
- Yeah.
- How did you find me?

928
01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:01.279
You know I can't say.

929
01:20:11.219 --> 01:20:15.776
You can take your hand
off your gun now.

930
01:20:24.233 --> 01:20:27.443
I got a contract
with Forest Services.

931
01:20:27.546 --> 01:20:29.169
To clear out this shit.

932
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:36.003
When you see it...

933
01:20:36.107 --> 01:20:38.109
it looks healthy.

934
01:20:43.459 --> 01:20:45.737
But inside...

935
01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:50.397
it's diseased. broken.

936
01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:54.434
I give it a new life like a--
a nice piece of glulam.

937
01:20:56.541 --> 01:20:58.992
Did you know that that shit
is stronger than steel?

938
01:20:59.094 --> 01:21:02.166
Santiago.
I don't have a lot of time.

939
01:21:04.445 --> 01:21:06.791
I gotta know what you and Socks
were mixed up in.

940
01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:08.553
where I can find her.

941
01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.903
She's a great fuckin' dog.

942
01:21:14.007 --> 01:21:16.077
The best.

943
01:21:19.529 --> 01:21:23.395
I had a family once.
She was part of it.

944
01:21:27.054 --> 01:21:29.091
Look what I did.

945
01:21:32.957 --> 01:21:36.925
You tell yourself
that they're family. but...

946
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:38.928
they're just tools.

947
01:21:39.032 --> 01:21:40.965
Gotta realize that.

948
01:21:44.313 --> 01:21:46.280
What are you talking about?

949
01:21:54.875 --> 01:21:56.566
She got sick.

950
01:22:01.502 --> 01:22:04.609
My daughter.

951
01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:08.130
I couldn't keep up.

952
01:22:08.233 --> 01:22:10.580
The co-pays and all that shit.

953
01:22:10.684 --> 01:22:12.478
They were charging me
thousands of dollars

954
01:22:12.582 --> 01:22:13.998
for the same painkillers

955
01:22:14.101 --> 01:22:16.585
I was confiscating
from those dudes downtown.

956
01:22:16.690 --> 01:22:19.279
you know. the ones
that shit their pants.

957
01:22:22.213 --> 01:22:24.422
I had to learn
how to make lemonade.

958
01:22:27.701 --> 01:22:29.392
Make ends meet.

959
01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:38.574
You got them their dogs.

960
01:22:40.852 --> 01:22:42.543
Yeah.

961
01:22:44.442 --> 01:22:46.996
Taught them how to--
how to use them.

962
01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.447
They'd fuck them up.

963
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:54.797
They had them chasing highs
instead of tennis balls.

964
01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:58.628
But when I saw
what they did to Socks...

965
01:22:58.732 --> 01:23:00.285
she was half-dead.

966
01:23:00.389 --> 01:23:03.184
So I told 'em that she had
worms. that worms spread.

967
01:23:03.288 --> 01:23:05.221
that they will crawl
into your skin

968
01:23:05.325 --> 01:23:07.223
and make their way
up to your eyes

969
01:23:07.327 --> 01:23:08.914
and get into your brain.
which is true.

970
01:23:09.018 --> 01:23:10.571
but when they heard that shit...

971
01:23:12.642 --> 01:23:15.128
...they wanted nothing
to do with her.

972
01:23:17.094 --> 01:23:19.132
So I got her back.

973
01:23:21.755 --> 01:23:23.446
I got her clean.

974
01:23:28.555 --> 01:23:30.212
Where are they?

975
01:23:32.766 --> 01:23:34.492
Xiang Xi house?

976
01:23:34.594 --> 01:23:36.735
Xiang.

977
01:23:36.839 --> 01:23:38.668
Xiang Xi.

978
01:23:38.772 --> 01:23:40.463
There's a new opium war.

979
01:23:40.567 --> 01:23:42.534
The Chinese smuggle that shit
to Mexico.

980
01:23:42.638 --> 01:23:45.227
and the cartels flood
that shit up though the border.

981
01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:46.675
They drop it right...

982
01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:49.196
in the actual dog shit.
right in the city.

983
01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.646
Nobody's gonna look at that.

984
01:23:50.749 --> 01:23:53.718
Nobody's gonna--
Who gives a shit about that?

985
01:23:53.821 --> 01:23:56.996
And the Satanistas sweat it
into street product.

986
01:23:57.101 --> 01:24:02.278
Anything anybody shoots.
smokes. snorts...

987
01:24:03.934 --> 01:24:06.593
The Chinese scratches.

988
01:24:06.696 --> 01:24:08.422
The most addictive thing
I've ever seen in my life.

989
01:24:08.526 --> 01:24:10.804
I've never seen
anything like that.

990
01:24:10.907 --> 01:24:13.289
And we're to blame for that--
'cause if there's one thing

991
01:24:13.393 --> 01:24:15.671
that we're more addicted
than anything else...

992
01:24:15.773 --> 01:24:17.500
is addiction itself.

993
01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.710
Santiago.

994
01:24:23.955 --> 01:24:25.646
Where's Socks?

995
01:24:29.166 --> 01:24:31.583
Shit rolls downhill. Jake.

996
01:24:34.207 --> 01:24:36.416
Follow it.

997
01:24:38.383 --> 01:24:40.420
What about your daughter?

998
01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.603
When I realized I didn't have
the balls to shoot myself...

999
01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.610
...I gave Socks a button.

1000
01:25:00.302 --> 01:25:03.374
The one thing
you never teach a K-9.

1001
01:26:50.826 --> 01:26:54.036
I found her.
I'll text you the address.

1002
01:26:59.490 --> 01:27:01.733
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1003
01:29:03.441 --> 01:29:05.063
Faas!

1004
01:29:12.692 --> 01:29:14.763
Watch your back. Rosser.

1005
01:29:27.707 --> 01:29:29.121
Aah!

1006
01:30:25.178 --> 01:30:27.629
Hey. man.

1007
01:30:27.732 --> 01:30:29.941
I just want my dog.

1008
01:30:30.045 --> 01:30:31.978
She isn't yours anymore.

1009
01:30:49.513 --> 01:30:52.723
Call her.
Go ahead. Call her.

1010
01:30:57.313 --> 01:30:58.798
Socks. here.

1011
01:31:02.594 --> 01:31:04.769
Socks! Come!

1012
01:31:08.221 --> 01:31:11.085
Socks. Here.

1013
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:13.019
Come here. girl! Come on!

1014
01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:19.612
Socks. Come on.

1015
01:31:31.657 --> 01:31:35.386
She belongs with me.

1016
01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:37.181
Hm?

1017
01:31:55.717 --> 01:31:58.236
- You're right.
- I know.

1018
01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:00.825
She's yours.

1019
01:32:00.929 --> 01:32:02.206
Fuck this.

1020
01:32:02.309 --> 01:32:05.139
Kill me.
Put me out on my misery.

1021
01:32:05.243 --> 01:32:06.900
Sic your dogs on me.

1022
01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:13.907
What was it you said the other
day? "Our side or suicide"?

1023
01:32:15.875 --> 01:32:17.946
I guess it's suicide then. huh?

1024
01:32:22.398 --> 01:32:24.159
"Suicide."
That's a funny word. huh?

1025
01:32:24.262 --> 01:32:26.023
Very.

1026
01:32:26.126 --> 01:32:28.577
What is "suicide" in German?
You speak German. don't you?

1027
01:32:28.681 --> 01:32:29.889
What is it?

1028
01:32:29.992 --> 01:32:31.822
- Selbstmord.

1029
01:32:59.469 --> 01:33:02.887
No answers yet about the
human remains of five victims

1030
01:33:02.991 --> 01:33:05.545
discovered among
100 million tons of garbage

1031
01:33:05.648 --> 01:33:07.305
in an area landfill.

1032
01:33:07.409 --> 01:33:10.136
Investigators say the bodies
are so badly decomposed.

1033
01:33:10.239 --> 01:33:12.794
it could take months
to uncover the identity

1034
01:33:12.897 --> 01:33:14.761
of these victims. if ever.

1035
01:33:14.865 --> 01:33:16.798
In our continuing coverage
of this story.

1036
01:33:16.901 --> 01:33:19.455
we will. of course.
keep you updated.

1037
01:33:30.535 --> 01:33:32.503
This is nothing.

1038
01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:35.057
Did I ever tell you
how hot Iraq gets?

1039
01:33:36.645 --> 01:33:40.200
130. And I'm not talking
like two days a year.

1040
01:33:40.304 --> 01:33:43.134
I'm talking about every
single day. 130 degrees.

1041
01:33:43.237 --> 01:33:45.032
You can literally
fry an egg on a rock.

1042
01:33:45.136 --> 01:33:47.138
You could have eggs all--
as many as you want.

1043
01:33:47.242 --> 01:33:50.693
If you carried eggs around Iraq.
you know.

1044
01:33:50.797 --> 01:33:52.696
you had a dozen eggs
for the day. you know.

1045
01:33:52.799 --> 01:33:55.215
and. uh. you were just
walking around Iraq.

1046
01:33:55.318 --> 01:33:58.771
you could literally fry up
an egg every single hour

1047
01:33:58.874 --> 01:34:00.704
and have an egg. fried egg.
every single hour.

1048
01:34:00.807 --> 01:34:02.326
You'd just throw it
on the ground--

1049
01:34:02.429 --> 01:34:04.085
boom. you got a fried egg.

1050
01:34:04.190 --> 01:34:06.192
If you carried some. you know.
rice and some beans.

1051
01:34:06.295 --> 01:34:09.228
you'd have a little taco.

1052
01:34:09.333 --> 01:34:12.129
I mean. not that you would
actually wanna eat it.

1053
01:34:14.062 --> 01:34:15.511
Well. youactually might.

1054
01:34:15.615 --> 01:34:17.686
You seem to want
to eat everything.

1055
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:19.826
Mama's waiting for us.
