00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.821
Good dog. Luula!

4
00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:08.084
Okay.
You want the gumdrop?

5
00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:09.781
- You want it?

6
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.830
- Go fetch!

7
00:02:20.314 --> 00:02:22.142
- I'll get it.

8
00:02:30.324 --> 00:02:32.108
Whoa!
What's that?

9
00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:37.592
Come on!
Let's check it out.

10
00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:51.214
It's so beautiful.

11
00:02:53.564 --> 00:02:54.609
And shiny.

12
00:03:00.354 --> 00:03:01.746
Marzipan!

13
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.618
Marzipan!

14
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.316
In a minute. Mom!

15
00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:09.885
Huh?
Wait.

16
00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:12.757
What just happened?

17
00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:15.151
Marzipan?

18
00:03:16.413 --> 00:03:17.414
Come on. Luula.

19
00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.774
Mom! I saw something
amazing in the woods.

20
00:03:29.948 --> 00:03:32.212
It was this...
sparkle-thingy.

21
00:03:33.517 --> 00:03:35.040
A sparkle-thingy. huh?

22
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.564
It was so pretty.

23
00:03:36.738 --> 00:03:41.003
It all was like...

24
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:43.310
What do you
think it was?

25
00:03:43.484 --> 00:03:44.789
I don't know.

26
00:03:44.963 --> 00:03:47.575
Maybe it was
a giant firefly?

27
00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:50.360
Or...
Or a really slow meteor.

28
00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:55.278
that was like. "I'm crashing
to Earth. but in my own time."

29
00:03:55.452 --> 00:03:56.801
Well. whatever it was.

30
00:03:56.975 --> 00:03:58.107
why don't you play in
the village today.

31
00:03:58.281 --> 00:03:59.935
just to be safe?

32
00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:05.201
Mom... I'm all grown up.
I'm like two feet tall.

33
00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:07.943
And I'll never.
ever get used to it.

34
00:04:08.117 --> 00:04:09.814
Have a great day.
sugar plum.

35
00:04:15.472 --> 00:04:17.822
We love you too. Luula.

36
00:04:17.996 --> 00:04:19.824
Have fun at work.

37
00:04:19.998 --> 00:04:22.827
You're gonna make a great...
Assistant Workshop Manager

38
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:26.178
of Elf Operations
and Toy Distribution...

39
00:04:26.353 --> 00:04:27.615
Whatever that is.

40
00:04:28.398 --> 00:04:29.704
Aww. Thanks.

41
00:04:29.878 --> 00:04:31.706
Let's hope
my boss agrees with you.

42
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.061
Walk with me. Cinnameg.

43
00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:41.759
You've gotta keep up. if you're
going to be my new manager.

44
00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:43.979
Got it.
Mr. Starsnaps.

45
00:04:44.153 --> 00:04:46.851
And please.
call me Crumble.

46
00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:48.810
Will do. sir.

47
00:04:48.984 --> 00:04:51.291
I have a lot of exciting ideas
to help improve the workshop.

48
00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:53.075
Improve the workshop?

49
00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:57.340
Why? Everything is
fine just the way it is.

50
00:04:57.514 --> 00:04:59.516
But we haven't
made enough toys.

51
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.084
and Christmas
is only a week away.

52
00:05:03.912 --> 00:05:05.000
Already?

53
00:05:05.174 --> 00:05:07.394
Huh.
I missed that somehow.

54
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.312
Eh. calendar schmalendar!
It always works out in the end.

55
00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:17.055
Morning. Estrellastar.

56
00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.883
How's Santa's List
coming along?

57
00:05:20.363 --> 00:05:22.147
We're in
the groove. Crumble.

58
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:29.807
Are we checking it twice?

59
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:30.939
Always!

60
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.130
See?
Everything's fine.

61
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.486
Whoa!

62
00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:03.624
You wanna play?
Here you go! Come and get it.

63
00:06:06.844 --> 00:06:09.456
Twelve Lords a-Leaping!

64
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.632
Luula!
Cathedral Cavern!

65
00:06:11.806 --> 00:06:12.894
There's that sparkle again!

66
00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:16.245
- Hey! Hey!

67
00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.290
Did you see
that bright light?

68
00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:22.033
Anyone? Anyone?
Am I talking to myself here?

69
00:06:26.081 --> 00:06:27.735
We gotta find out
what it is.

70
00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:30.520
Come on. Luula!

71
00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:40.878
Attention. everyone!

72
00:06:41.052 --> 00:06:42.010
Attention!

73
00:06:42.184 --> 00:06:43.751
Apparently.

74
00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:47.407
there are only seven
days left before Christmas.

75
00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:51.846
I know.
Time flies. right?

76
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.891
Anyway.

77
00:06:54.065 --> 00:06:56.241
we're a gumdrop
behind schedule.

78
00:07:00.811 --> 00:07:01.812
Hit me!

79
00:07:07.252 --> 00:07:09.516
We're gonna have fun.
eat cookies.

80
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.910
and keep making toys
with heart!

81
00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:16.131
See how I handled that?

82
00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:19.656
There's no low
elf-esteem in my workshop.

83
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.049
You get it?

84
00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:25.706
Oh. I kill me!

85
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.405
Crumble. I love your
confidence - and your jokes -

86
00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:32.016
but those are things
the elves were already doing.

87
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.368
We need to modernize.
You know. like the reindeer did!

88
00:07:36.543 --> 00:07:39.154
Okay. I have that report back on
the status of the sleigh polish.

89
00:07:39.328 --> 00:07:40.808
It's looking
really good right now.

90
00:07:43.637 --> 00:07:46.074
Looks like we've got
a weather alert in Sector 5.

91
00:07:46.248 --> 00:07:47.597
Zoom in.

92
00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:49.469
Roger. Donner. Zooming.

93
00:07:50.513 --> 00:07:51.601
Optimizing Antler Radar.

94
00:08:01.306 --> 00:08:04.745
It's a snowstorm.
and it's headed our way.

95
00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:08.488
Great work. team. High hoof.
Don't leave me hanging.

96
00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:12.927
We don't need any
of that fancy-fangled

97
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:15.973
reindeer
modernization around here.

98
00:08:16.147 --> 00:08:19.716
For us elves. Christmas
is about one thing...

99
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.065
heart!

100
00:08:23.415 --> 00:08:26.593

Hi. llamacorns!

137
00:10:31.108 --> 00:10:33.197
You're looking extra
pepperminty this morning!

138
00:10:39.203 --> 00:10:41.728
Hello. Winter Wishes Moose!
Merry almost Christmas!

139
00:10:41.902 --> 00:10:44.600
Hmm. You. too!

140
00:10:52.086 --> 00:10:54.001
Hi. Gingerbread bunnies!

141
00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:06.666
"Grizzly Gap"?
I've never been here before.

142
00:11:12.149 --> 00:11:13.934
Luula. look!

143
00:11:14.108 --> 00:11:15.805
The sparkle is still there!

144
00:11:15.979 --> 00:11:17.241
Let's go!

145
00:11:23.944 --> 00:11:27.817
Hey. Boss. I know you're on a
cookie break. but got a moment?

146
00:11:28.905 --> 00:11:30.646
Sure do.
What's up?

147
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.779
I've been crunching
the numbers on my Elfpad

148
00:11:32.953 --> 00:11:35.782
and this toy shortage
is worse than I thought.

149
00:11:35.956 --> 00:11:38.959
We don't have enough trains.
or dolls. or puzzles.

150
00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:41.570
and don't even get me
started about the robots.

151
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:46.618
Yes!

152
00:11:47.358 --> 00:11:49.099
Hey. Edgar.
you want a cookie?

153
00:11:49.273 --> 00:11:50.405
Go long!

154
00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:52.276
Oh! Ah! Oh! Agh!

155
00:11:58.108 --> 00:11:59.327
Nice catch!

156
00:12:00.502 --> 00:12:02.896
Cinnameg. what's this?

157
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.463
Heart.

158
00:12:05.637 --> 00:12:09.467
And what is every toy in
Santa's workshop made with?

159
00:12:10.555 --> 00:12:11.861
I see where you're
going with this.

160
00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:13.471
and I'm not trying
to get rid of the heart.

161
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:16.474
I love heart. I'm. like.
the captain of team heart!

162
00:12:16.648 --> 00:12:18.999
I just want to make sure we
have enough toys for Christmas.

163
00:12:20.043 --> 00:12:22.393
I've been doing this
for a 129 years

164
00:12:22.567 --> 00:12:25.396
and we've always
had enough toys.

165
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.139
I even got a pin for it.
What's that say?

166
00:12:31.054 --> 00:12:33.317
"Chief Workshop Manager".

167
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:37.495
That's right.
So. stop worrying.

168
00:12:37.669 --> 00:12:39.497
You're in the North Pole.

169
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:42.587
Chill out!

170
00:12:43.632 --> 00:12:46.113
Heart you!
Good talk.

171
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.656
I don't know if I like
this place either. Luula.

172
00:13:14.445 --> 00:13:16.404
Now. I definitely
don't like it!

173
00:13:20.887 --> 00:13:21.931
Ahh!

174
00:13:26.022 --> 00:13:28.895
Oh. thank tinsel.
It's just an owl.

175
00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:32.899
Um. hi. Mr. Owl?
Can you help us?

176
00:13:33.073 --> 00:13:35.684
We're looking for
a mystical sparkly thing.

177
00:13:37.077 --> 00:13:38.208
Hoot-hoot!

178
00:13:39.862 --> 00:13:42.125
One more time.
A little slower.

179
00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:45.563
Hoot. Hoot.

180
00:13:46.564 --> 00:13:47.914
Oh. Okay.

181
00:13:48.088 --> 00:13:49.959
I've really gotta
learn how to speak owl.

182
00:13:50.655 --> 00:13:52.353
No. no. no. no. no!

183
00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.705
Well. Luula. we should
probably head back.

184
00:13:58.663 --> 00:13:59.839
It's getting late.

185
00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:03.668
Huh?

186
00:14:05.366 --> 00:14:07.368
What's that?

187
00:14:12.025 --> 00:14:12.852
Wait!

188
00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:23.297
Is that you. sparkle thingy?

189
00:14:26.517 --> 00:14:28.476
And why do I hear snoring?

190
00:14:30.304 --> 00:14:31.740
Ahh!

191
00:14:33.524 --> 00:14:35.135
- You're not a sparkle!

192
00:14:41.054 --> 00:14:43.752
You're a... bear!

193
00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.411
Luula. don't move.

194
00:14:50.585 --> 00:14:51.891
We don't want
to look like prey.

195
00:14:54.067 --> 00:14:57.548
Not that kind of pray.
Although. it couldn't hurt.

196
00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:02.553
It's not working.

197
00:15:02.727 --> 00:15:05.165
Uh... look fierce.

198
00:15:10.344 --> 00:15:13.260
Feel my tickle power.
you giant bear.

199
00:15:13.434 --> 00:15:16.176
Take... Take that. Mr. Bear!

200
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.351
And that!

201
00:15:17.525 --> 00:15:19.483
And here's
under the armpit!

202
00:15:19.657 --> 00:15:21.442
Ooh. yeah.
this should do it.

203
00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:22.573
Tickle. tickle. tickle.

204
00:15:24.401 --> 00:15:25.663
Oh. right under
the foot.

205
00:15:25.837 --> 00:15:27.317
Yeah. it's a weak spot.

206
00:15:28.884 --> 00:15:29.972
What are you doing?

207
00:15:30.146 --> 00:15:31.800
I'm defending myself.

208
00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:33.062
From what?

209
00:15:34.063 --> 00:15:37.110
From you.
You're Grizzly da Bear.

210
00:15:37.284 --> 00:15:39.634
Everyone says
you're really mean.

211
00:15:39.808 --> 00:15:40.983
No offense.

212
00:15:41.157 --> 00:15:42.898
Uh. none taken.

213
00:15:43.594 --> 00:15:46.119
You know. you elves have been
giving me a bad rap for years.

214
00:15:46.293 --> 00:15:49.905
And yes. I admit.
I... have a temper.

215
00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:52.734
I may have pulled
one or two Christmas trees

216
00:15:52.908 --> 00:15:55.345
out of the ground because
they were blocking my view.

217
00:16:00.742 --> 00:16:02.048
That was you?

218
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.225
But I gave all
that up years ago.

219
00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:07.053
Yeah. I'm
a good grizzly now.

220
00:16:07.227 --> 00:16:08.619
Although. I still run

221
00:16:08.793 --> 00:16:10.621
with the wrong pack
of wolves on occasion.

222
00:16:10.795 --> 00:16:13.494
You know. a bear's gotta have
some fun. you know what I mean?

223
00:16:14.756 --> 00:16:16.366
Kind of.

224
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.934
I'm saying there's a lot
more to me than meets the eye.

225
00:16:19.108 --> 00:16:23.460
like right now I'm hibernating.
or at least I'm trying to.

226
00:16:23.634 --> 00:16:25.985
Ah. something's
been stuck in my hide.

227
00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:27.943
Haven't gotten
any sleep in a month.

228
00:16:28.117 --> 00:16:29.075
Want me to look?

229
00:16:29.249 --> 00:16:30.728
No. I got it.

230
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.560
You clearly don't.

231
00:16:36.734 --> 00:16:38.040
Let me help you.

232
00:16:38.214 --> 00:16:40.564
Why would you help me?

233
00:16:40.738 --> 00:16:43.263
Because I'm an elf;
it's what we do.

234
00:16:43.437 --> 00:16:45.352
Now. stand still.

235
00:16:49.921 --> 00:16:51.532
Oh. it's only
a little thorn.

236
00:16:51.706 --> 00:16:52.881
I'll get it.

237
00:16:53.055 --> 00:16:54.839
No! Ow! Ow! Ow!

238
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.711
I... didn't
touch you yet.

239
00:16:56.885 --> 00:16:58.582
Yeah. but-- but
you're gonna.

240
00:16:59.888 --> 00:17:01.455
On a count of three.

241
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:03.805
One... two...

242
00:17:03.979 --> 00:17:06.460
Ahh! Ow!

243
00:17:06.634 --> 00:17:07.461
Done.

244
00:17:07.635 --> 00:17:09.028
You big bear cub.

245
00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:17.166
Whoa. Look at the size
of that thing.

246
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.255
It could have
punctured something.

247
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:20.648
You're welcome.

248
00:17:22.258 --> 00:17:23.694
Oh. thank you.

249
00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:25.914
Anyway. if you're done
making noise out here.

250
00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:27.872
I. uh...
I gotta get some sleep.

251
00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:29.091
Capisce?

252
00:17:29.265 --> 00:17:31.137
Wait! Mr. da Bear?

253
00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:35.228
You haven't seen a magical
sparkle. have you?

254
00:17:35.402 --> 00:17:36.968
No.

255
00:17:37.143 --> 00:17:38.709
And if I haven't seen
something in the North Pole.

256
00:17:38.883 --> 00:17:40.494
it don't exist. kid.

257
00:17:40.668 --> 00:17:42.235
Good luck. though.

258
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:44.976
If you need anything.
my friends call me 'Grizz'.

259
00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:46.587
You know where to find me.

260
00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.515
Um. I think it's time
we made our way back home.

261
00:18:03.343 --> 00:18:06.389
Okay. Elflings.
snuggle up.

262
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.740
It's time for
your bedtime story.

263
00:18:09.914 --> 00:18:12.003
And tonight.
we're going to read

264
00:18:12.178 --> 00:18:15.311
about how reindeer
learned to fly.

265
00:18:21.187 --> 00:18:22.536
Oh. my elf!

266
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.364
You're never gonna
believe what happened!

267
00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:26.409
Marzipan. there you are.

268
00:18:26.583 --> 00:18:30.196
Sage Evergreen. I saw this
amazing sparkle today.

269
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.937
and it looked
kind of like that.

270
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.765
Really?

271
00:18:34.939 --> 00:18:38.813
Well. then you're going to
enjoy this story very much.

272
00:18:38.987 --> 00:18:41.381
Now. where were we?

273
00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:43.948
At the beginning!

274
00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:45.298
Oh. yes.

275
00:18:46.647 --> 00:18:50.738
"A long time ago. in a
village much like this one -

276
00:18:50.912 --> 00:18:53.001
because it was this one -

277
00:18:53.567 --> 00:18:56.874
there's a very
special snow deer

278
00:18:57.048 --> 00:18:59.268
named... Glisten.

279
00:19:00.051 --> 00:19:02.445
She was made
of pure stardust

280
00:19:02.619 --> 00:19:06.406
and could fly as fast
as a shooting star."

281
00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:08.451
Whoa!
That's so fast!

282
00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:10.627
My dad says
that shooting stars

283
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:13.108
can go like fifty billion
miles an hour.

284
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.546
Sounds scientifically accurate.

285
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.982
Anyway...

286
00:19:19.419 --> 00:19:20.942
"One day.

287
00:19:21.116 --> 00:19:23.858
Glisten sprinkled stardust
on the elves' garden.

288
00:19:24.032 --> 00:19:28.210
And when Santa's reindeer
ate the corn on Christmas Eve.

289
00:19:28.428 --> 00:19:29.429
they could fly."

290
00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:30.865
What the...?

291
00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:32.954
This is different.

292
00:19:33.128 --> 00:19:37.437
"And every year after that.
Glisten led Santa's sleigh.

293
00:19:37.611 --> 00:19:40.962
so they could deliver
toys all around the world.

294
00:19:41.484 --> 00:19:42.877
And when children saw her.

295
00:19:43.051 --> 00:19:46.054
she sparkled with Christmas
spirit."

296
00:19:47.273 --> 00:19:50.189
Green garland!
That's the sparkle I saw.

297
00:19:50.363 --> 00:19:51.712
I saw Glisten!

298
00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:54.802
Hi. I'm home!

299
00:19:54.976 --> 00:19:56.238
Mom!

300
00:19:56.412 --> 00:19:57.718
Hi. sugarplum.

301
00:19:57.892 --> 00:19:59.459
Guess what?

302
00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:01.678
I saw Glisten.
the snow deer!

303
00:20:01.852 --> 00:20:05.291
That's impossible.
Glisten vanished years ago.

304
00:20:05.465 --> 00:20:09.686
Uh. you ruined
the end of my story.

305
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.123
- Oh. man!

306
00:20:12.298 --> 00:20:13.429
Sorry.

307
00:20:13.603 --> 00:20:14.778
It's okay.

308
00:20:14.952 --> 00:20:16.345
We'll read another
one tomorrow.

309
00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:19.305
Come on. time for
slumber noggins. everyone.

310
00:20:19.479 --> 00:20:20.219
Let's go.

311
00:20:23.526 --> 00:20:25.441
- Sweet dreams.
Good night.

312
00:20:32.753 --> 00:20:34.755
But why did Glisten
go away?

313
00:20:35.321 --> 00:20:36.887
No one knows
for sure.

314
00:20:37.061 --> 00:20:39.760
But. according
to the story.

315
00:20:39.934 --> 00:20:44.112
Glisten disappeared because
people stopped believing in her.

316
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.549
Oh.

317
00:20:46.723 --> 00:20:50.336
So. maybe you have to
believe in Glisten

318
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.599
before you can
really see her.

319
00:20:52.773 --> 00:20:54.775
It's certainly possible.

320
00:20:55.906 --> 00:20:58.518
Okay. sugarplum.
off to bed.

321
00:20:58.692 --> 00:21:01.390
- I love you.
- Love you. too.

322
00:21:01.564 --> 00:21:03.827
Good night.
Good night. Sage Evergreen.

323
00:21:12.532 --> 00:21:13.924
Thank you. Sage.

324
00:21:15.317 --> 00:21:17.624
What a day.

325
00:21:17.798 --> 00:21:21.149
You know.
Marzipan has a point.

326
00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:22.890
Maybe. sometimes.

327
00:21:23.064 --> 00:21:26.285
you do have to believe in
something before you can see it.

328
00:21:27.764 --> 00:21:28.939
I know this much:

329
00:21:29.113 --> 00:21:30.724
there's no way we're
going to get

330
00:21:30.898 --> 00:21:33.727
all those toys made in time
for Christmas.

331
00:21:33.901 --> 00:21:35.076
Oh. no.

332
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.817
Not enough toys
for Christmas?

333
00:21:36.991 --> 00:21:39.036
Luula. we've got
to help Mom.

334
00:21:44.477 --> 00:21:46.957
Cinnameg. have faith.

335
00:21:48.698 --> 00:21:50.396
I guess.

336
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.835
Believing is the first step
to making a dream come true.

337
00:21:55.009 --> 00:21:58.186
Do you see anything
between us right now?

338
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.623
Uh. no.

339
00:22:00.797 --> 00:22:03.670
Well. I do. Love.

340
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:09.676
Remember. just because
you can't see something

341
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.504
doesn't mean it's not there.

342
00:23:00.814 --> 00:23:02.598
I miss you. Jinglestar.

343
00:23:06.994 --> 00:23:09.953
Cinnameg.
now that we're engaged.

344
00:23:10.127 --> 00:23:14.741
I want you to have this:
the double-star amulet.

345
00:23:14.915 --> 00:23:17.526
It sparkles when you believe
in the spirit of Christmas.

346
00:23:19.223 --> 00:23:22.575
I'll always believe.
as long as you're by my side.

347
00:23:55.346 --> 00:23:58.567
Six days until Christmas!

348
00:24:00.308 --> 00:24:01.614
Ah. sir?

349
00:24:01.788 --> 00:24:02.919
Sir. could you
look at this. please?

350
00:24:03.093 --> 00:24:04.399
All right.
let's tighten that up.

351
00:24:04.573 --> 00:24:06.227
Merry morning everyone!
You needed me?

352
00:24:06.401 --> 00:24:08.534
There's a storm headed
to the North Pole.

353
00:24:08.708 --> 00:24:11.754
It's a few days away.
but it looks bad.

354
00:24:11.928 --> 00:24:13.843
How bad?

355
00:24:14.017 --> 00:24:15.671
See for your elf.

356
00:24:31.165 --> 00:24:33.123
Hop for your lives!

357
00:24:33.297 --> 00:24:35.474
Ahh!

358
00:24:36.605 --> 00:24:38.520
Oh. crumpled
wrapping paper!

359
00:24:38.694 --> 00:24:41.175
We've got to launch Santa's
sleigh before that storm hits.

360
00:24:41.349 --> 00:24:44.352
which is impossible because
I don't have enough toys.

361
00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:47.268
What's with Crumble not
taking any of your ideas?

362
00:24:50.532 --> 00:24:51.968
Every time
I make a suggestion.

363
00:24:52.142 --> 00:24:54.623
he starts elf-splaining
to me about having heart.

364
00:24:54.797 --> 00:24:56.364
Well. you know elves.

365
00:24:56.538 --> 00:24:59.846
they love lots of heart...
and lots of dancing.

366
00:25:03.414 --> 00:25:05.373
Crumble!
What's going on?

367
00:25:05.547 --> 00:25:08.158
We're having
a bit of a jig break.

368
00:25:13.599 --> 00:25:15.862
But there's only
six days till Christmas!

369
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.342
Come on. it's fun!

370
00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:20.040
Ahh!

371
00:25:20.214 --> 00:25:21.607
What about the toys?

372
00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:23.434
Can't help it. Cinnameg.

373
00:25:23.609 --> 00:25:25.567
When the music gets ya.
ya gotta give in!

374
00:25:25.741 --> 00:25:27.700
Ahh!

375
00:25:27.874 --> 00:25:29.919
This is why
I didn't become a dancer.

376
00:25:47.328 --> 00:25:48.329
Whoa!

377
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:51.854
Whoa!

378
00:25:52.028 --> 00:25:53.334
Whoo!

379
00:25:55.902 --> 00:25:57.381
But what if
something else goes wrong?

380
00:25:57.556 --> 00:26:00.080
It's Christmas!
Chill out.

381
00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:05.694
- Oh. no!

382
00:26:05.868 --> 00:26:08.088
Holy holly.
that's the alarm.

383
00:26:08.262 --> 00:26:09.568
What's happening?

384
00:26:10.612 --> 00:26:11.744
Oh. no!

385
00:26:11.918 --> 00:26:13.223
Help!

386
00:26:13.397 --> 00:26:15.095
The Nice Machine
is being very naughty!

387
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:16.662
ELF
<i>Emergency!</i>

388
00:26:16.836 --> 00:26:18.794
<i>Code Red Suit!
I repeat. emergency!</i>

389
00:26:18.968 --> 00:26:20.274
<i>Code Red Suit!</i>

390
00:26:20.448 --> 00:26:23.364
Don't panic. elf-ybody.
Don't panic...

391
00:26:31.328 --> 00:26:34.157
And that's how
you draw a snow deer.

392
00:26:34.331 --> 00:26:36.725
Now. let's see
your drawings.

393
00:26:42.513 --> 00:26:44.298
] <i>Emergency!</i>

394
00:26:44.472 --> 00:26:47.083
<i>Code Red Suit!
I repeat. emergency!</i>

395
00:26:47.257 --> 00:26:48.955
<i>Code red suit!</i>

396
00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.705
- Oh. no!
- Help!

397
00:26:59.879 --> 00:27:02.055
- Mom!

398
00:27:14.067 --> 00:27:15.459
Excuse you.

399
00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:17.026
That wasn't me.

400
00:27:19.594 --> 00:27:22.118
What do we do?
What do we do?!

401
00:27:22.292 --> 00:27:23.467
You're the boss.

402
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:24.947
We gotta shut it down.

403
00:27:26.035 --> 00:27:26.906
But how?

404
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.559
I don't know.

405
00:27:28.734 --> 00:27:30.692
Nothing's ever gone wrong
in the workshop before.

406
00:27:30.866 --> 00:27:32.868
There's a switch!
On the wall!

407
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:35.523
Come on!

408
00:27:41.094 --> 00:27:43.487
Hurry! I'm about
to get checked twice!

409
00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:46.012
Aah! It's got
me. too!

410
00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:48.057
- Mom!

411
00:27:48.231 --> 00:27:49.276
I'll save you!

412
00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.452
Marzipan. stay there.

413
00:27:51.626 --> 00:27:53.149
We've got this.

414
00:27:53.323 --> 00:27:56.065
Don't got this!
Definitely don't got this!

415
00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:59.634
This machine is not nice!

416
00:27:59.808 --> 00:28:01.114
Turn it off!

417
00:28:02.115 --> 00:28:03.769
I'm coming!

418
00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:13.126
Aah! Paper cut!
Paper cut!

419
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.910
So many paper cuts!

420
00:28:16.738 --> 00:28:18.784
Phew. Made it.

421
00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:23.223
But... I can't reach.

422
00:28:23.397 --> 00:28:25.225
I know! Luula!

423
00:28:34.277 --> 00:28:35.844
Woo-hoo!

424
00:28:36.018 --> 00:28:38.455
Phew! Yay!

425
00:28:38.629 --> 00:28:41.850
Marzipan. that was elf-mazing!

426
00:28:42.024 --> 00:28:43.634
But never do it again.

427
00:28:43.809 --> 00:28:46.768
The machine was jammed.
That's why it's been so glitchy.

428
00:28:46.942 --> 00:28:48.727
All these extra names
were stuck inside.

429
00:28:48.901 --> 00:28:50.380
Oh. no!

430
00:28:50.554 --> 00:28:52.818
So. now. we have
to make even more toys?

431
00:28:52.992 --> 00:28:57.170
What? We can't do that.
That's impossible.

432
00:28:57.344 --> 00:29:00.173
Don't panic. We'll...
We'll figure something out.

433
00:29:00.347 --> 00:29:02.175
I'm panicking.

434
00:29:02.349 --> 00:29:03.916
I'm definitely panicking.

435
00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:06.048
Remember what
Albert Elfstein said:

436
00:29:06.222 --> 00:29:08.224
"We can't solve problems
with the same thinking

437
00:29:08.398 --> 00:29:09.878
that we used to create them."

438
00:29:10.052 --> 00:29:11.837
Yeah. yeah.
Yeah. you're... You're right.

439
00:29:12.011 --> 00:29:14.056
You're right. it's all good.

440
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.320
as good as a gumdrop.
good as a golden goose.

441
00:29:18.408 --> 00:29:19.932
At least Santa's not here.

442
00:29:20.106 --> 00:29:21.977
Ho-ho-ho. everyone.

443
00:29:22.151 --> 00:29:23.500
Santa!

444
00:29:23.674 --> 00:29:27.026
Ahh! Calendars?
Toys?! Nice kids?!

445
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.507
Lists?

446
00:29:30.681 --> 00:29:32.466
Cinnameg.

447
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.773
I think it's time for you to
be in charge of the workshop.

448
00:29:34.947 --> 00:29:37.340
Oh! Um. okay.

449
00:29:37.514 --> 00:29:41.431
Everyone. Cinnameg
is now the official

450
00:29:41.605 --> 00:29:44.521
Chief Workshop Manager.

451
00:29:44.695 --> 00:29:46.915
Um. what just happened?

452
00:29:47.089 --> 00:29:50.223
I think you just
got promoted... again!

453
00:29:50.397 --> 00:29:52.094
- Congratulations. Cinnameg.

454
00:29:52.268 --> 00:29:55.271
I'll see you in
my office immediately.

455
00:29:55.445 --> 00:29:58.579
Ugh...
I need a cookie.

456
00:30:00.711 --> 00:30:02.670
Well. well. well. Cinnameg.

457
00:30:02.844 --> 00:30:04.585
I don't know what to do.

458
00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:08.502
We don't have enough toys. and
there's this big storm coming.

459
00:30:08.676 --> 00:30:10.373
Hmm. hmm. hmm...

460
00:30:15.291 --> 00:30:19.121
Cinnameg. do you know about
the tradition of the pickle?

461
00:30:19.295 --> 00:30:20.949
There's a pickle
tradition?

462
00:30:21.123 --> 00:30:24.823
Yes. Very popular
in Germany...

463
00:30:24.997 --> 00:30:26.302
and all the best
sandwich shops.

464
00:30:29.784 --> 00:30:31.133
You see. on Christmas Eve.

465
00:30:31.307 --> 00:30:32.918
a pickle is hidden
on the Christmas tree.

466
00:30:33.092 --> 00:30:36.356
and whoever finds it.
gets an extra present.

467
00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:40.490
So. the pickle isn't just
a pickle; it's a gift.

468
00:30:40.664 --> 00:30:42.275
It is?

469
00:30:42.449 --> 00:30:45.191
The nice machine broke.
and that created a pickle.

470
00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:49.456
But then. you got promoted.
so it's also a gift.

471
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:53.503
I have faith you'll be able to
get us out of all our pickles.

472
00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:56.115
You really think so?

473
00:30:56.289 --> 00:30:58.030
Because it's going to take
a miracle

474
00:30:58.204 --> 00:31:00.206
for Christmas
to happen this year.

475
00:31:01.468 --> 00:31:03.992
Mom needs help
making toys.

476
00:31:04.688 --> 00:31:08.475
and there's only one bear
big enough for that job.

477
00:31:09.737 --> 00:31:11.347
We need Grizz!

478
00:31:11.521 --> 00:31:13.088
- Come on!

479
00:31:19.747 --> 00:31:20.791
Hello again. llamacorns!

480
00:31:29.713 --> 00:31:31.498
Merry. merry.
almost. almost Christmas!

481
00:31:36.938 --> 00:31:38.722
What's up.
Gingerbread bunnies?

482
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.074
Aww. Love you more.

483
00:31:46.643 --> 00:31:49.342
We made it. Luula:
Grizzly Gap!

484
00:31:49.516 --> 00:31:50.691
Oh!

485
00:31:54.303 --> 00:31:55.957
Hoot hoot!

486
00:31:56.131 --> 00:31:58.568
Hi. Mr. Owl.
Have you seen Grizz?

487
00:31:59.656 --> 00:32:01.658
Hoot.

488
00:32:04.792 --> 00:32:06.881
I have no idea
what he said.

489
00:32:07.055 --> 00:32:09.231
- We need our map.

490
00:32:20.764 --> 00:32:22.679
This looks familiar.

491
00:32:24.594 --> 00:32:27.206
Grizz? Grizz?

492
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.816
Are you here?

493
00:32:33.081 --> 00:32:34.953
Snore once
if you can hear me!

494
00:32:38.217 --> 00:32:39.870
Grizz!

495
00:32:50.229 --> 00:32:52.971
Hey. please tell me this
is some sort of bad dream.

496
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:57.714
Nope.
It's real.

497
00:32:59.194 --> 00:33:00.413
I'm really sorry
to wake you up.

498
00:33:00.587 --> 00:33:02.067
I don't believe you.

499
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:04.504
It's just...
my mom's in trouble.

500
00:33:04.678 --> 00:33:08.508
and there's this storm coming.
and Glisten is gone!

501
00:33:08.682 --> 00:33:10.423
Are you still
stuck on this thing?

502
00:33:10.597 --> 00:33:12.773
It's. uh. your eyes
playing tricks on you.

503
00:33:16.081 --> 00:33:18.997
You said you'd help me.
and that's why I'm here.

504
00:33:19.171 --> 00:33:20.781
I didn't mean that.

505
00:33:20.955 --> 00:33:23.479
It's... It's like when you say.
uh. "How you doing?"

506
00:33:23.653 --> 00:33:26.656
But you don't really
want to know. you know?

507
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.223
Why would you do that?

508
00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:33.750
Ah. never mind.
What's up. huh? Spill it.

509
00:33:33.924 --> 00:33:36.318
The elves need help
making toys for Christmas.

510
00:33:37.319 --> 00:33:38.973
Christmas. huh?

511
00:33:39.147 --> 00:33:41.062
Yeah. I ain't
never had one.

512
00:33:41.236 --> 00:33:42.542
Tinsel on a tree!

513
00:33:42.716 --> 00:33:45.240
You've never
celebrated Christmas?

514
00:33:45.414 --> 00:33:47.547
Wow. you really
are loud.

515
00:33:47.721 --> 00:33:52.508
As for Christmas. no. okay?
I haven't had one.

516
00:33:52.682 --> 00:33:55.337
Um...
First. I'm usually asleep.

517
00:33:55.511 --> 00:33:57.992
But mostly because.
you know. I'm naughty.

518
00:33:58.166 --> 00:34:00.125
or at least
that's what the elves think...

519
00:34:00.299 --> 00:34:03.128
and the bunnies.
llamacorns. of course.

520
00:34:03.302 --> 00:34:05.739
owls. most other birds.

521
00:34:05.913 --> 00:34:07.697
Christmas trees.
if they could talk.

522
00:34:07.871 --> 00:34:10.439
Anyway. you get
the point. right?

523
00:34:10.613 --> 00:34:12.963
There it is:
no Christmas presents

524
00:34:13.138 --> 00:34:14.965
for naughty.
naughty Grizz.

525
00:34:16.141 --> 00:34:17.881
This is not okay.

526
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:20.754
Now. you have to come
to Santa's workshop.

527
00:34:20.928 --> 00:34:22.669
No thanks.

528
00:34:22.843 --> 00:34:24.236
But. Grizz...

529
00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:26.368
I'm on
the naughty list. kid.

530
00:34:26.542 --> 00:34:29.937
The world sees me as a big.
scary. naughty predator.

531
00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:31.765
But you're not.

532
00:34:31.939 --> 00:34:35.812
I know that. and you know that.
but they don't know that.

533
00:34:38.902 --> 00:34:41.296
But we need
your help. Please?

534
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:43.559
Forget it.
Not happening.

535
00:34:43.733 --> 00:34:45.692
I'll be
your best friend.

536
00:34:45.866 --> 00:34:47.085
Please?

537
00:34:47.259 --> 00:34:48.912
Please? Please?
Please? Please?

538
00:34:49.087 --> 00:34:50.392
Please? Please? Please?
Please? Please? Please? Please?

539
00:34:50.566 --> 00:34:52.351
- No. no. no. no. no.
- Please? Please? Please?

540
00:34:52.525 --> 00:34:53.743
- Infinity.
- Please? Please? Please?

541
00:34:53.917 --> 00:34:54.962
- No backsies.
- Please?!

542
00:34:56.703 --> 00:35:01.534
Please?!

543
00:35:01.708 --> 00:35:03.318
Fine. I'll go.

544
00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.409
But you're lucky
I have sensitive ears.

545
00:35:07.583 --> 00:35:11.239
Yay! You're gonna love
Christmas. I promise.

546
00:35:11.413 --> 00:35:13.502
Okay. that's never
happening again.

547
00:35:13.676 --> 00:35:15.678
Now. let's go
before I change my mind.

548
00:35:48.929 --> 00:35:51.714
Attention. everyone!
Attention!

549
00:35:53.629 --> 00:35:56.284
I found someone
to help make all our toys.

550
00:35:56.458 --> 00:36:00.723
It's my new best friend.
Drumroll. please.

551
00:36:02.943 --> 00:36:04.423
Mm. close enough.

552
00:36:04.597 --> 00:36:06.990
Grizzly da Bear!

553
00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:24.007
Hey.

554
00:36:30.405 --> 00:36:32.712
Hmm. That went better
than expected.

555
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.063
Say hello. everyone.

556
00:36:36.237 --> 00:36:37.978
Don't be shy.

557
00:36:38.152 --> 00:36:41.547
Grizz has given up his winter
'hy-bear-nation' to help us out!

558
00:36:44.854 --> 00:36:46.508
Yo. what's up?
How you doing?

559
00:36:46.682 --> 00:36:48.815
Don't worry.
I really want to know this time.

560
00:36:51.339 --> 00:36:54.821
So. I. uh. hear you elves
make a mean cup of hot toffee.

561
00:36:54.995 --> 00:36:57.737
I could sure use a pick me up.
and then... badda bang!

562
00:37:04.352 --> 00:37:05.962
That means
I'll be ready to work.

563
00:37:08.095 --> 00:37:10.010
Oh. um. good...
good to know.

564
00:37:13.666 --> 00:37:16.103
Sorry. I. uh.
skipped lunch.

565
00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.715
Uh. will someone get
this bear some cookies.

566
00:37:19.889 --> 00:37:22.631
so he doesn't get hungry
for an elf-sized snack?

567
00:37:24.329 --> 00:37:25.068
I'll help.

568
00:37:25.243 --> 00:37:26.374
- On it!
- Me too!

569
00:37:33.338 --> 00:37:35.992
Edgar. you and Grizz
have a lot in common.

570
00:37:36.166 --> 00:37:37.820
- We do?
- Yes.

571
00:37:37.994 --> 00:37:39.474
You already
love Christmas.

572
00:37:39.648 --> 00:37:42.085
and Grizz is going
to love Christmas.

573
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:44.349
- Cool.
- Cool.

574
00:37:47.787 --> 00:37:49.136
Here's your snack.

575
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:58.493
Please don't eat me.

576
00:38:05.979 --> 00:38:08.721
Wow. that's a mean cup
of toffee.

577
00:38:08.895 --> 00:38:10.418
Thanks. Pal.

578
00:38:12.768 --> 00:38:14.596
Oh! Sorry!

579
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.119
I'm okay.

580
00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:18.905
So. uh. how can I help?

581
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:33.267
Um. that one's broken.

582
00:38:35.138 --> 00:38:37.967
Let's find a
different way to help.

583
00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:40.056
How about
video game testing?

584
00:38:52.939 --> 00:38:55.158
Or building
doll houses.

585
00:39:03.863 --> 00:39:07.432
That thing's like
a bear trap with curtains.

586
00:39:07.606 --> 00:39:08.650
Or roller skates.

587
00:39:08.824 --> 00:39:10.609
Ahh!

588
00:39:10.783 --> 00:39:12.959
Why would you make
standing on two legs harder?

589
00:39:13.133 --> 00:39:14.352
Ahh!

590
00:39:19.574 --> 00:39:23.839
Beep. Beep.
Beep. Beep.

591
00:39:24.013 --> 00:39:26.755
I think we
figured it out. Grizz.

592
00:39:26.929 --> 00:39:28.670
- Wow!
Wow.

593
00:39:30.411 --> 00:39:32.457
Thanks for
the talk. Santa.

594
00:39:32.631 --> 00:39:35.590
Christmas is about
believing. Cinnameg.

595
00:39:35.764 --> 00:39:39.028
It's about finding our faith
when difficult things happen.

596
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:43.424
It's about
the pickle.

597
00:39:43.598 --> 00:39:45.121
I'll never
forget it.

598
00:39:47.254 --> 00:39:48.734
And delivering toys

599
00:39:48.908 --> 00:39:51.214
is what helps keep
the Christmas spirit alive.

600
00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:53.260
It's our Merry Mission.

601
00:40:02.138 --> 00:40:05.272
Santa. Marzipan
thinks she saw Glisten.

602
00:40:06.316 --> 00:40:08.580
Is it really possible?

603
00:40:08.754 --> 00:40:12.497
Hmm. hmm. hmm...
That's a good question.

604
00:40:12.671 --> 00:40:16.675
Glisten is made of stardust
and faith. like all of us.

605
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:19.852
Her magic comes from
the spirit of Christmas.

606
00:40:20.026 --> 00:40:23.638
When our belief is strong.
so are Glisten's powers.

607
00:40:23.812 --> 00:40:26.119
and that's
when we can see her.

608
00:40:26.293 --> 00:40:29.209
And when the spirit of
Christmas is strongest.

609
00:40:29.383 --> 00:40:33.735
the wishing star and the star
of Christmas will align.

610
00:40:35.258 --> 00:40:37.696
My husband gave me an amulet
with those stars on it

611
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:39.654
a long time ago.

612
00:40:39.828 --> 00:40:42.657
Maybe it's
not a coincidence.

613
00:40:42.831 --> 00:40:45.530
Now. go find
that pickle. Chief.

614
00:40:45.704 --> 00:40:46.966
Will do. sir.

615
00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.882
I don't know why
I'm saluting right now.

616
00:41:02.634 --> 00:41:04.897
Grizz!
You're doing great.

617
00:41:07.116 --> 00:41:09.379
Amazing. actually.

618
00:41:09.554 --> 00:41:11.381
Who would
have thought?

619
00:41:11.556 --> 00:41:14.907
We're building toys with
the help of Grizzly da Bear -

620
00:41:15.081 --> 00:41:17.387
the notorious
and scariest bear

621
00:41:17.562 --> 00:41:21.696
in the North Pole.
who is on the naughty list!

622
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:23.132
Ahh!

623
00:41:23.306 --> 00:41:24.482
What did you just say?

624
00:41:27.093 --> 00:41:28.050
- Oh.

625
00:41:29.095 --> 00:41:30.705
Really. huh?

626
00:41:30.879 --> 00:41:32.098
Uh...

627
00:41:32.272 --> 00:41:33.839
That's still all
I am to you. just some...

628
00:41:34.013 --> 00:41:36.494
naughty list grizzly bear
from the woods. huh?

629
00:41:39.148 --> 00:41:41.673
Grizz. try
to stay positive.

630
00:41:41.847 --> 00:41:44.763
He's been working
on his anger management.

631
00:42:03.956 --> 00:42:06.741
No. I'm sorry.
I... I didn't mean it!

632
00:42:09.918 --> 00:42:11.616
Wait! Don't go!

633
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:14.401
I have a temper.
but I'm working on it.

634
00:42:14.575 --> 00:42:17.056
Grizz. it's okay.
Look at me.

635
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:18.666
We can fix this.

636
00:42:19.798 --> 00:42:22.365
Grizzly da Bear!

637
00:42:30.504 --> 00:42:32.767
What's that?
Zoom in.

638
00:42:36.249 --> 00:42:39.295
What the...?
Emergency!

639
00:42:39.469 --> 00:42:41.776
<i>Code Red Suit!
I repeat. emergency!</i>

640
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:43.778
<i>Code Red Suit!</i>

641
00:42:43.952 --> 00:42:47.129
Okay. this is gonna
be harder to fix.

642
00:42:52.787 --> 00:42:54.659
Grizz. wait!

643
00:43:06.801 --> 00:43:09.238
Oh no. What now?

644
00:43:11.371 --> 00:43:13.591
Grizz. please!

645
00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:15.897
Wait!

646
00:43:26.691 --> 00:43:29.694
I thought they would
accept you. like I did.

647
00:43:30.999 --> 00:43:32.522
I'm so sorry.

648
00:43:32.697 --> 00:43:35.830
No crying. And what
did I say about hugs?

649
00:43:36.657 --> 00:43:38.137
Look. it's probably
not your fault.

650
00:43:38.311 --> 00:43:40.269
I'm Grizzly da Bear.

651
00:43:40.443 --> 00:43:43.882
and that means... I'll always
be on the naughty list.

652
00:43:44.056 --> 00:43:45.492
Not to me.

653
00:43:46.841 --> 00:43:47.799
Thanks.

654
00:43:49.148 --> 00:43:50.149
See ya around. kid.

655
00:43:50.976 --> 00:43:52.542
And it felt good to help.

656
00:43:52.717 --> 00:43:54.588
even if it was only
for a little while.

657
00:43:56.851 --> 00:43:58.070
Oh. Luula...

658
00:43:59.724 --> 00:44:01.551
Marzipan! Sugarplum!

659
00:44:01.726 --> 00:44:03.292
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

660
00:44:03.466 --> 00:44:05.468
Mom. I'm fine.

661
00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:07.557
Thank elfness.

662
00:44:07.732 --> 00:44:11.605
What were you doing bringing
Grizzly da Bear to the workshop?

663
00:44:11.779 --> 00:44:12.911
He's nice!

664
00:44:13.085 --> 00:44:15.565
That naughty stuff
isn't even true.

665
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.785
Honey. you have a big heart.

666
00:44:17.959 --> 00:44:20.353
but. sometimes. there are
things we can't change.

667
00:44:20.527 --> 00:44:23.269
I thought Christmas
was about being kind.

668
00:44:23.443 --> 00:44:25.619
even to mean
old grizzly bears.

669
00:44:25.793 --> 00:44:27.447
Shouldn't that
count for something?

670
00:44:36.064 --> 00:44:39.981
Marzipan. your mom and I know
you were just trying to help.

671
00:44:40.155 --> 00:44:44.464
but how in the glacier
did you meet a bear?

672
00:44:44.638 --> 00:44:46.509
I met him when I was
looking for Glisten.

673
00:44:47.728 --> 00:44:50.035
Do you think
Glisten's real?

674
00:44:50.209 --> 00:44:52.385
As real as the magic
of Christmas.

675
00:44:52.559 --> 00:44:55.997
Remember. you never
know what can happen

676
00:44:56.171 --> 00:44:58.652
when you
truly believe.

677
00:45:10.925 --> 00:45:12.884
Well Jinglestar.

678
00:45:13.058 --> 00:45:15.800
I might be the first
workshop manager in history

679
00:45:15.974 --> 00:45:18.759
to not deliver
toys on Christmas.

680
00:45:18.933 --> 00:45:21.631
Ugh. I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

681
00:45:21.806 --> 00:45:23.155
Or if you can even
hear me.

682
00:45:37.996 --> 00:45:40.476
Five days until Christmas!

683
00:45:45.786 --> 00:45:47.222
Okay. everyone.

684
00:45:47.396 --> 00:45:49.268
how are we gonna
save Christmas?

685
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.969
Don't look at us.

686
00:45:55.143 --> 00:45:56.971
It's not our fault
there's not enough toys.

687
00:45:57.145 --> 00:45:58.843
Here we go again.

688
00:45:59.017 --> 00:46:02.194
"The elves did this.
the elves did that.

689
00:46:02.368 --> 00:46:05.850
"The elves used my
antlers as a coat hanger."

690
00:46:06.024 --> 00:46:08.635
Uh. it's getting old.

691
00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:13.683
Everyone focus.

692
00:46:13.858 --> 00:46:16.164
We need to solve this
before Santa gets here.

693
00:46:16.338 --> 00:46:18.079
Ho-ho-ho.

694
00:46:18.253 --> 00:46:21.648
Every Christmas has a story.
but they're all about believing.

695
00:46:21.822 --> 00:46:24.607
So. here I am!
Wow me.

696
00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:26.131
You got it. Santa!

697
00:46:33.616 --> 00:46:35.314
That's what
I'm talking about.

698
00:46:41.102 --> 00:46:43.017
If we're making
all these extra toys.

699
00:46:43.191 --> 00:46:45.715
shouldn't we make
enough for everyone?

700
00:46:46.499 --> 00:46:48.066
Even if
they were naughty?

701
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.415
- What?

702
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:52.461
- That's not tradition!

703
00:46:52.635 --> 00:46:56.857
I know. but just because
someone was naughty once.

704
00:46:57.031 --> 00:46:59.077
doesn't mean
they're not good.

705
00:46:59.251 --> 00:47:01.166
Now. that's wowing me.

706
00:47:03.995 --> 00:47:05.735
Okay.

707
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:10.479
So. if everyone gets
a toy. then. let's see...

708
00:47:10.653 --> 00:47:15.571
Uh. maybe we can make enough
toys. if we automate production.

709
00:47:15.745 --> 00:47:16.659
But...

710
00:47:17.704 --> 00:47:18.748
But what?

711
00:47:18.923 --> 00:47:21.142
We can only make
one kind of toy.

712
00:47:21.316 --> 00:47:23.318
One kind of toy?!

713
00:47:23.492 --> 00:47:25.799
For every girl
and boy?

714
00:47:25.973 --> 00:47:27.453
Hear me out.

715
00:47:27.627 --> 00:47:30.238
It could be a gift that
every kid would love.

716
00:47:30.412 --> 00:47:31.631
Like what?

717
00:47:31.805 --> 00:47:33.372
I know! Carrots.

718
00:47:33.546 --> 00:47:36.766
No. no. corn!
They love corn.

719
00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:39.160
Stick to
the weather. flyboy.

720
00:47:39.334 --> 00:47:40.814
Hm. hm. hm.

721
00:47:40.988 --> 00:47:43.556
Yes. Cinnameg may have
just solved the pickle.

722
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:48.561
In all my Christmases.
there's one toy everyone loves -

723
00:47:48.735 --> 00:47:52.870
boys. girls. young and old.
all over the world!

724
00:47:53.044 --> 00:47:54.219
Well?

725
00:47:54.393 --> 00:47:56.656
Are you going to
tell us what it is?

726
00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:58.484
Oh. yes.
of course.

727
00:47:58.658 --> 00:48:01.487
It's... a teddy bear.

728
00:48:02.227 --> 00:48:03.315
What?

729
00:48:03.489 --> 00:48:04.838
Santa's right.

730
00:48:05.012 --> 00:48:07.101
Everyone deserves
a good bear in their life.

731
00:48:07.275 --> 00:48:08.886
Where's the heart?

732
00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:12.150
Elves can't make billions
of bears with no heart.

733
00:48:12.324 --> 00:48:15.109
We'll never make
gifts without heart.

734
00:48:15.283 --> 00:48:17.982
Love is why
we make the toys.

735
00:48:18.156 --> 00:48:21.420
They'll always be filled
with the spirit of Christmas.

736
00:48:21.594 --> 00:48:23.509
It's our
Merry Mission.

737
00:48:23.683 --> 00:48:26.033
That reminds me
of a story.

738
00:48:27.817 --> 00:48:31.778
<i>Long ago. when I decided to
dedicate my life to Christmas.</i>

739
00:48:31.952 --> 00:48:34.694
<i>I told Mrs. Claus
my plans.</i>

740
00:48:38.263 --> 00:48:41.875
<i>And the next morning. she gave
me the most wonderful present:</i>

741
00:48:43.485 --> 00:48:45.139
<i>a tiny heart...</i>

742
00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.710
...so her love would
be with me forever.

743
00:48:52.103 --> 00:48:53.582
Wait a minute.

744
00:48:53.756 --> 00:48:56.759
What if we put a heart
like that in each bear?

745
00:48:56.934 --> 00:48:59.197
Then. the elves can make
a holiday wish on the heart.

746
00:48:59.371 --> 00:49:02.722
so children know the teddy bears
were made with love.

747
00:49:07.118 --> 00:49:11.035
Marzipan. you are on fire
today. like a Yule log.

748
00:49:11.209 --> 00:49:12.775
Let's do it!

749
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:16.040
Okay. you heard the man.
All hands and hooves on deck.

750
00:49:16.214 --> 00:49:18.956
It's teddy bears
with heart for everyone!

751
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.696
Woo-hoo!
Nice job.

752
00:49:30.271 --> 00:49:32.970

That's it!

766
00:50:49.785 --> 00:50:52.136
We've made enough
bears for everyone!

767
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:54.225
That's what
I'm talking about!

768
00:50:56.314 --> 00:50:58.968
Merry Christmas!

769
00:50:59.143 --> 00:51:01.232
Whoo!

770
00:51:01.406 --> 00:51:03.886
- You did it. Mom!

771
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:05.845
I knew you'd be
an amazing

772
00:51:06.019 --> 00:51:10.241
Chief Workshop Manager of Toy
Operations and Elf Distribution

773
00:51:10.415 --> 00:51:11.938
or whatever it is.

774
00:51:12.112 --> 00:51:13.592
I did do it!

775
00:51:13.766 --> 00:51:17.117
I mean. we all did.

776
00:51:17.291 --> 00:51:18.771
Elf-gratulations.
everyone!

777
00:51:18.945 --> 00:51:21.034
Woo-hoo!

778
00:51:21.513 --> 00:51:24.516
Wow. Look at
what you did.

779
00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:26.605
I can't say
I'm surprised.

780
00:51:26.779 --> 00:51:29.869
After all. I taught you
everything you know.

781
00:51:31.262 --> 00:51:32.915
You sure
it's gonna work?

782
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.482
It has to work.

783
00:51:41.228 --> 00:51:43.622
One day until Christmas!

784
00:51:43.796 --> 00:51:47.626
Otherwise known
as Christmas Eve!

785
00:51:59.203 --> 00:52:00.421
Ho-ho-hello. everyone!

786
00:52:00.595 --> 00:52:02.380
- And Merry Christmas Eve!

787
00:52:05.339 --> 00:52:08.734
- Santa!

788
00:52:08.908 --> 00:52:11.563
Welcome. Santa.
We're ready for you.

789
00:52:11.737 --> 00:52:13.913
Please take
the seat of honor.

790
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.620
Look at all these
beautiful teddy bears.

791
00:52:25.794 --> 00:52:27.666
Yup. we did it.

792
00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.842
Let's check your weight
and get you up in the air.

793
00:52:30.016 --> 00:52:31.887
Edgar. activate
the scale.

794
00:52:48.991 --> 00:52:53.257
One reindeer.
two reindeer. three...

795
00:52:53.431 --> 00:52:54.997
Come on. stop.

796
00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:58.566
Four... five...

797
00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.220
six...

798
00:53:01.874 --> 00:53:03.963
seven...

799
00:53:04.137 --> 00:53:05.530
eight...

800
00:53:12.972 --> 00:53:14.582
Eight!

801
00:53:14.756 --> 00:53:19.108
Oh. that's a relief.
Okay. we are ready for launch!

802
00:53:19.283 --> 00:53:20.458
- Woo-hoo!

803
00:53:20.632 --> 00:53:24.592
- Yeah!

804
00:53:24.766 --> 00:53:26.638
- Yes!
- See that?

805
00:53:26.812 --> 00:53:28.770
Never missed
a Christmas.

806
00:53:32.209 --> 00:53:33.122
- Ho-ho...

807
00:53:33.297 --> 00:53:36.169
- Uh-oh.

808
00:53:36.343 --> 00:53:37.953
Oh. no!
Oh. no!

809
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.525
Oh. my mistletoe.

810
00:53:45.004 --> 00:53:47.746
Phew. Glad
I'm not in charge.

811
00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.443
- Launch is a no-go.

812
00:53:49.617 --> 00:53:52.316
We're too dang heavy
with all these teddy bears.

813
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:53.708
I gotta think.

814
00:53:53.882 --> 00:53:57.495
Why can't anything be easy?

815
00:53:57.669 --> 00:54:00.193
Don't suppose you know where to
find another flying reindeer?

816
00:54:01.412 --> 00:54:05.198
Glisten.
But does she even exist?

817
00:54:06.504 --> 00:54:09.768
I have to believe.
Come on. Luula. Hurry!

818
00:54:41.495 --> 00:54:46.108
Whoa.

819
00:54:46.283 --> 00:54:47.588
Whoa!

820
00:55:07.086 --> 00:55:08.392
Hoot!

821
00:55:09.175 --> 00:55:10.655
Hoot! Hoot!

822
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:13.484
I say. quite a storm
we're having. isn't it?

823
00:55:13.658 --> 00:55:14.659
Hoot!

824
00:55:14.833 --> 00:55:17.444
Wait.
Now you can talk?

825
00:55:17.618 --> 00:55:21.492
I've been brushing up
on my elfish. Hoot!

826
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:23.842
Ahh!
My map!

827
00:55:29.064 --> 00:55:30.414
Hoo-hoo!

828
00:55:33.242 --> 00:55:36.898
Okay. Fine.
I'll get there myself...

829
00:55:37.072 --> 00:55:38.291
somehow.

830
00:55:39.901 --> 00:55:41.555
Pull.

831
00:55:41.729 --> 00:55:42.904
- Pull.
- Come on. team!

832
00:55:43.078 --> 00:55:44.645
Pull.

833
00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:45.777
Put your backs into it!

834
00:55:45.951 --> 00:55:47.387
Harder. Pull.

835
00:55:47.561 --> 00:55:48.867
- Everybody together now.

836
00:55:49.041 --> 00:55:50.956
It's going to make it...

837
00:55:59.617 --> 00:56:02.228
Cinnameg. there's no way to get
this sleigh off the ground

838
00:56:02.402 --> 00:56:04.578
without removing
some teddy bears.

839
00:56:04.752 --> 00:56:05.971
That's not an option.

840
00:56:06.145 --> 00:56:08.103
Those children
are counting on us.

841
00:56:12.194 --> 00:56:14.066
Wait a minute.
Where's Marzipan?

842
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.807
Umm. I haven't
seen her since...

843
00:56:15.981 --> 00:56:18.375
I asked you if you knew
any other flying reindeer.

844
00:56:21.639 --> 00:56:22.901
Oh. no.
She's looking for Glisten.

845
00:56:23.075 --> 00:56:24.424
In this weather?

846
00:56:24.598 --> 00:56:25.947
I gotta find her.

847
00:56:26.992 --> 00:56:28.210
Need a ride?

848
00:56:28.385 --> 00:56:30.169
I'll get you
some snow shoes.

849
00:56:30.343 --> 00:56:33.346
I don't need no
stinkin' snow shoes!

850
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.522
I'm a flying reindeer.

851
00:56:37.132 --> 00:56:38.917
Cinnameg.
what's happening?

852
00:56:39.091 --> 00:56:42.050
Marzipan's missing.
I'm going to get her.

853
00:56:42.224 --> 00:56:44.009
Remember what
I told you.

854
00:56:44.183 --> 00:56:46.751
Have faith!
You'll need it.

855
00:56:49.188 --> 00:56:50.537
Thank you.

856
00:56:54.019 --> 00:56:56.238
Just keep believing. Cinnameg.

857
00:56:56.413 --> 00:56:57.805
I'll try. Santa.

858
00:57:07.293 --> 00:57:09.034
She has
to be here.

859
00:57:09.643 --> 00:57:11.471
This is the end
of the map.

860
00:57:12.733 --> 00:57:13.908
I don't want to judge.

861
00:57:14.082 --> 00:57:15.910
but if I was
a magical snow deer.

862
00:57:16.084 --> 00:57:18.652
I'd hang out in a
much less scary cave.

863
00:57:24.484 --> 00:57:25.485
I don't like what I'm seeing.

864
00:57:25.659 --> 00:57:26.965
Can we get
a read on that?

865
00:57:27.139 --> 00:57:28.401
Let's get the
light strips out there.

866
00:57:28.575 --> 00:57:30.229
I don't like
the look of that storm.

867
00:57:30.403 --> 00:57:31.926
Oh. it's big.

868
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:33.624
and Donner and Cinnameg are
heading straight for it.

869
00:58:24.196 --> 00:58:27.199
Oh! There it is!

870
00:58:29.462 --> 00:58:31.420
With any luck.
we can beat her there!

871
00:58:31.595 --> 00:58:34.859
But I'm gonna have to fly real
low to get out of these clouds.

872
00:58:44.999 --> 00:58:46.218
We made it!

873
00:59:21.427 --> 00:59:24.996
Oh... So. this
is Cathedral Cavern.

874
00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:28.129
Okay. Now. I get why
Glisten hangs out here.

875
00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.358
Glisten?
Are you in here?

876
00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.884
Glisten?

877
00:59:52.893 --> 00:59:53.981
There you are!

878
00:59:58.203 --> 01:00:00.161
And... you
have friends.

879
01:00:01.772 --> 01:00:03.425
...who are
growling at me.

880
01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.781
This is not good.

881
01:00:17.744 --> 01:00:19.006
The storm's
getting worse.

882
01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.052
We gotta pull Donner
and Cinnameg back!

883
01:00:21.226 --> 01:00:23.663
Donner. the storm
has gone from bad to coal.

884
01:00:23.837 --> 01:00:24.925
Return to base.

885
01:00:27.406 --> 01:00:28.625
No can do. Cupid.

886
01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:40.637
Oh. I'm so glad
I'm not a giraffe.

887
01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:47.948
Okay. wolves. Just one question
before I run for my life.

888
01:00:49.776 --> 01:00:52.649
You haven't seen a sparkly
snow deer. have you?

889
01:00:54.607 --> 01:00:55.652
Didn't think so.

890
01:00:55.826 --> 01:00:58.132
Bye! Ah!

891
01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:12.581
Grizz! How did you
know I was here?

892
01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:15.236
You have no idea
how loud you are. do you?

893
01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.544
Wait.
Grizz?

894
01:01:18.718 --> 01:01:20.894
As in
Grizzly da Bear?

895
01:01:21.068 --> 01:01:23.114
What's up. pups?
How ya doing?

896
01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:26.639
Ah. you know. just having
fun and being naughty.

897
01:01:26.813 --> 01:01:29.598
Looks like we might have
a Christmas feast tonight.

898
01:01:29.773 --> 01:01:31.731
Wanna join. Grizz?

899
01:01:31.905 --> 01:01:33.341
Come soon. Glisten.

900
01:01:33.515 --> 01:01:34.952
I believe in you.

901
01:01:35.517 --> 01:01:36.954
Sorry.
She's with me.

902
01:01:37.128 --> 01:01:38.912
Really?

903
01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.220
Too bad for you.

904
01:01:42.394 --> 01:01:46.180
because it's winter and
we are hangry.

905
01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:49.009
Too bad for you.
because I'm nice now.

906
01:01:49.183 --> 01:01:50.445
- Nice?
- Yeah.

907
01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:52.752
but I'm still
all grizzly about it.

908
01:02:18.082 --> 01:02:18.647
Grizz!

909
01:02:21.128 --> 01:02:22.564
How you like that?

910
01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.436
- Or that?

911
01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:26.220
- Ah!

912
01:02:28.353 --> 01:02:29.528
Ah!

913
01:02:45.674 --> 01:02:47.328
That's it.
straight ahead!

914
01:02:48.329 --> 01:02:49.330
On it.

915
01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:11.352
Ah!

916
01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.051
Aw. dang flab it.

917
01:03:14.225 --> 01:03:15.792
We're in a vortex.
Hold on.

918
01:03:22.276 --> 01:03:24.801
Ah! Ah!

919
01:03:30.241 --> 01:03:31.198
Ah!

920
01:03:38.031 --> 01:03:39.032
Ah!

921
01:03:46.518 --> 01:03:47.519
Run!

922
01:03:56.658 --> 01:03:57.703
Grizz. stop!

923
01:03:57.877 --> 01:03:59.357
It's going
to break!

924
01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:00.924
But this is
the only way out.

925
01:04:01.098 --> 01:04:02.621
What else
are we gonna do?

926
01:04:02.795 --> 01:04:03.665
Uh...

927
01:04:09.106 --> 01:04:10.847
We let them
get closer.

928
01:04:11.021 --> 01:04:11.848
Closer?

929
01:04:12.022 --> 01:04:13.066
Just do what I do.

930
01:04:22.902 --> 01:04:24.121
Come on. wolves!

931
01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:25.122
Is that all you got?

932
01:04:30.736 --> 01:04:33.086
Ah!

933
01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:37.351
- Oh. I get it now.

934
01:04:53.672 --> 01:04:55.195
Avalanche!

935
01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:57.545
Run for cover!
Now!

936
01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:17.609
Whoa!

937
01:05:17.783 --> 01:05:18.915
No!

938
01:05:31.362 --> 01:05:32.450
No. no. no. no!

939
01:05:34.713 --> 01:05:36.628
Grizz!

940
01:05:46.899 --> 01:05:48.814
Grizz!
Hold on!

941
01:05:49.467 --> 01:05:51.251
Don't worry
about me. kid.

942
01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:52.949
I got this.

943
01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.214
Come on. Marzipan.

944
01:05:57.388 --> 01:06:00.217
Believe. I know
you can do it.

945
01:06:00.391 --> 01:06:01.696
I know you can do it.

946
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:02.654
I know you can...

947
01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:08.529
I'm coming
for you. Grizz!

948
01:06:11.097 --> 01:06:13.926
<i>Believe. I know you can do it.</i>

949
01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.407
<i>I know you can do it.
I know you can do it.</i>

950
01:06:16.581 --> 01:06:17.712
I believe.

951
01:07:02.496 --> 01:07:05.456
Okay. I believe.

952
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:07.110
I believe
I can do this.

953
01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.029
Ah!

954
01:07:14.595 --> 01:07:15.814
Whoa!

955
01:07:17.424 --> 01:07:18.599
Whoa!

956
01:07:20.732 --> 01:07:22.864
Pull up!
Pull up!

957
01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.170
On it.

958
01:07:28.696 --> 01:07:29.784
Marzipan. stop!

959
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:34.267
I'm fine.

960
01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:37.053
Ah!

961
01:07:56.985 --> 01:07:58.857
Can't do it.
We're going down.

962
01:07:59.945 --> 01:08:02.687
- We're going down.
- Ah!

963
01:08:06.995 --> 01:08:08.084
Oh. no.
What?

964
01:08:08.258 --> 01:08:09.563
We lost Donner.

965
01:08:09.737 --> 01:08:10.912
He's gone.

966
01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:12.827
Donner. Donner.
do you read me?

967
01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:14.264
Donner. are you there?

968
01:08:21.488 --> 01:08:22.446
Ah!

969
01:08:25.188 --> 01:08:26.667
- Ah!

970
01:08:30.541 --> 01:08:33.500
Ah!

971
01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:38.331
Ah. I can't look.

972
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.865
Woo-hoo!

973
01:08:54.652 --> 01:08:56.610
You can look. Grizz.

974
01:08:56.784 --> 01:08:57.785
You can look.

975
01:08:57.959 --> 01:09:00.092
Glisten saved me!

976
01:09:00.266 --> 01:09:02.355
Whoa.
You're real?

977
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:07.882
Hey. watch out
for those antlers.

978
01:09:08.056 --> 01:09:09.145
Gentle. gentle.

979
01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.365
Whoa.
Close one.

980
01:09:12.539 --> 01:09:14.150
Are you okay. Grizz?

981
01:09:14.324 --> 01:09:15.716
Me?
Never better.

982
01:09:17.762 --> 01:09:19.938
Now. don't you
have Christmas to save?

983
01:09:20.112 --> 01:09:21.461
Get out of here. kid.

984
01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.989
- Come on. Luula.

985
01:09:28.164 --> 01:09:30.035
Let's go
save Christmas!

986
01:09:44.615 --> 01:09:46.399
Ho. ho. holy star.

987
01:09:48.358 --> 01:09:49.272
She did it.

988
01:09:49.446 --> 01:09:50.795
Marzipan did it!

989
01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:52.753
Yahoo!

990
01:09:56.844 --> 01:09:58.194
Now. that's
one good elf.

991
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.544
Woo-hoo!

992
01:10:00.718 --> 01:10:02.981
Come on. Donner.
Work with me here.

993
01:10:07.115 --> 01:10:09.770
My amulet.
It's glowing.

994
01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:13.034
What's that?

995
01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:16.473
My daughter.

996
01:10:16.647 --> 01:10:17.822
Come on!

997
01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:24.263
Hi. Mom!

998
01:10:24.437 --> 01:10:26.352
Marzipan.
hang on tight!

999
01:10:26.526 --> 01:10:27.962
Fly. Glisten.
fly!

1000
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:35.927
- I got Donner!

1001
01:10:36.101 --> 01:10:37.189
He's back!

1002
01:10:37.363 --> 01:10:39.060
And there's someone
with him!

1003
01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.280
Yes!

1004
01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:42.673
We're back.

1005
01:10:42.847 --> 01:10:44.196
Donner?
Is that you?

1006
01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:46.938
It sure is.
and Glisten.

1007
01:10:47.112 --> 01:10:48.244
Prep the launch pad.

1008
01:10:48.418 --> 01:10:50.942
This Merry Mission
is on.

1009
01:10:53.423 --> 01:10:54.293
Woo-hoo!

1010
01:10:54.467 --> 01:10:56.252
Let's go. everybody.

1011
01:10:58.079 --> 01:10:59.907
It's game time.

1012
01:11:00.081 --> 01:11:01.909
We have three hours
until Christmas.

1013
01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:03.302
Move out!

1014
01:11:03.476 --> 01:11:04.738
Opening launch
bay doors.

1015
01:11:22.582 --> 01:11:25.193
Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

1016
01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:27.065
All the time.

1017
01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:35.160
Glisten. it's you.

1018
01:11:35.334 --> 01:11:36.944
I always knew
you'd be here

1019
01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:38.598
when we needed
you most.

1020
01:11:38.772 --> 01:11:40.296
I believe.

1021
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:42.123
It's good
to see you again.

1022
01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.300
It's good
to be seen. Santa.

1023
01:11:49.392 --> 01:11:52.612
Mom! I love you
so much.

1024
01:11:52.786 --> 01:11:54.092
I love you. sugarplum.

1025
01:11:56.268 --> 01:11:57.965
And this is Glisten.

1026
01:11:58.139 --> 01:11:59.315
I see that.

1027
01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:02.666
Thank you
so much.

1028
01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.408
It was Marzipan's faith
that brought me back.

1029
01:12:05.582 --> 01:12:08.324
You have the true spirit
of Christmas in your heart.

1030
01:12:10.413 --> 01:12:11.544
She gets it
from her father.

1031
01:12:13.024 --> 01:12:15.156
And I hope
I get it from her.

1032
01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:16.375
We got to go.

1033
01:12:16.549 --> 01:12:19.030
Glisten. tonight is all you.

1034
01:12:19.204 --> 01:12:20.336
Take the lead.

1035
01:12:21.685 --> 01:12:23.774
Goodbye for now. Marzipan.

1036
01:12:23.948 --> 01:12:25.558
Thank you
for believing in me.

1037
01:12:25.732 --> 01:12:27.343
Thank you
to all of you.

1038
01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:42.053
Hold on tight.

1039
01:12:42.227 --> 01:12:44.011
I like to fly fast.

1040
01:12:44.185 --> 01:12:46.623
Launching in ten. nine--

1041
01:12:46.797 --> 01:12:50.191
Uh. uh. blast off?

1042
01:12:57.416 --> 01:12:58.809
Whoa-ho-ho!

1043
01:12:58.983 --> 01:13:01.464
Merry Christmas!

1044
01:13:24.922 --> 01:13:26.271
Did I miss anything?

1045
01:13:26.445 --> 01:13:28.752
And why is Edgar
covered in glitter?

1046
01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:32.930
Grizz!
You're here!

1047
01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:36.847
If I'm allowed
to be.

1048
01:13:37.021 --> 01:13:39.023
Of course you are!

1049
01:13:39.197 --> 01:13:42.287
From now on. you're always
welcome in Christmas Village.

1050
01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:46.030
Aw. Can we get in
on this hug?

1051
01:13:46.204 --> 01:13:47.205
Me. too.

1052
01:13:48.598 --> 01:13:50.948
Oh. you're so soft.

1053
01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:53.211
And musky.

1054
01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:57.215
Thanks. Now. I finally get
why they call it a bear hug.

1055
01:14:00.174 --> 01:14:03.090
Well. I guess now that
the crisis is over.

1056
01:14:03.264 --> 01:14:04.962
you can have this back.

1057
01:14:05.136 --> 01:14:08.226
Oh. no. After
all that's happened.

1058
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.924
I'm pleased to
announce that you are

1059
01:14:11.098 --> 01:14:15.146
the permanent
Chief Workshop Manager...

1060
01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.104
of everything!

1061
01:14:17.278 --> 01:14:19.498
Are you serious?

1062
01:14:19.672 --> 01:14:21.500
Do I ever
joke around?

1063
01:14:21.674 --> 01:14:23.720
Wait. Forget
I said that.

1064
01:14:23.894 --> 01:14:25.722
Mom. you did it!

1065
01:14:25.896 --> 01:14:27.724
Thank you. Crumble.

1066
01:14:27.898 --> 01:14:29.943
and as my first
