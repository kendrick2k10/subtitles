00:10:02.253 --> 00:10:04.734
Guys. it could not be more dark
down there.

182
00:10:04.865 --> 00:10:06.040
All right. guys. Let's. uh...

183
00:10:06.214 --> 00:10:09.217
Whoa. You okay?

184
00:10:09.478 --> 00:10:11.045
Thomas?THOMAS: It's okay. it's okay.

185
00:10:11.175 --> 00:10:14.309
It's all right.
Just a little nosebleed.

186
00:10:14.483 --> 00:10:15.876
Come on. Let's take care of you.

187
00:10:16.006 --> 00:10:19.227
Come here. Y... You okay?
I got some tissue.

188
00:10:19.662 --> 00:10:21.359
It's okay.Here. Tilt your head back.

189
00:10:21.446 --> 00:10:22.796
Can you tilt your head back?

190
00:10:22.883 --> 00:10:24.188
There you go. Hold that there.
Hold it.

191
00:10:24.319 --> 00:10:28.410
All right. All right.
little man. Let's go.

192
00:10:30.717 --> 00:10:32.675
Bloody... bloody nose?ELLIE: Yeah.

193
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.766
I used to get those
as a kid. They're the worst.

194
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.652
Spencer!BEN: Oh. my God.

195
00:10:55.002 --> 00:10:56.090
Whoa. dude.

196
00:10:56.481 --> 00:11:00.094
Spencer. you have to be careful!

197
00:11:01.835 --> 00:11:04.185
Are you listening?
Oh. my God.

198
00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:05.839
Is he okay?

199
00:11:05.969 --> 00:11:06.927
He's fine.

200
00:11:09.538 --> 00:11:11.583
It's okay. it's okay.MARGARET: I think it's. uh...

201
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.933
I got you....time to go.

202
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.630
I'm so glad
you were there.

203
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:16.284
Oh. yeah. thanks. babe.

204
00:11:28.383 --> 00:11:30.254
Cabrón. technically.
the actual term is. uh.

205
00:11:30.341 --> 00:11:33.562
"Macho cabrío."
like the male goat.

206
00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:35.912
Really?Yeah.

207
00:11:36.043 --> 00:11:37.218
Oh. no. THOMAS: That. um. that...

208
00:11:37.479 --> 00:11:38.523
That doesn't
translate literally.

209
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.829
The kids are zonked.

210
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.396
That hike really
took it out of them.

211
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.007
They're sleeping like
the dead in there.

212
00:11:44.355 --> 00:11:46.706
Did you give Spencer
that gift you brought him?

213
00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:48.708
Oh. no. I was gonna do it
after dinner.Hmm.

214
00:11:51.014 --> 00:11:52.189
I got him devil sticks.

215
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.930
Hmm.I saw them at a shop
on our last trip.

216
00:11:54.017 --> 00:11:55.540
and I... I had some
when I was a kid.

217
00:11:55.627 --> 00:11:57.020
I loved them.
I thought he'd like them.

218
00:11:58.108 --> 00:11:59.675
They're harmless hippie toys.

219
00:11:59.762 --> 00:12:02.156
Uh. yeah.
They kind of are.

220
00:12:02.243 --> 00:12:04.462
Harmless as that souvenir
slingshot

221
00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:05.637
he almost took my eye out with

222
00:12:05.768 --> 00:12:07.030
last summer?Mm-hmm.

223
00:12:07.552 --> 00:12:09.990
That was maybe
not the best gift.

224
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.382
Thought that counts.

225
00:12:11.469 --> 00:12:13.341
Babe. can you pass me a beer?Yeah.

226
00:12:14.908 --> 00:12:16.866
You guys should look
into. like.

227
00:12:16.997 --> 00:12:19.086
the Badlands.BEN: Dude.

228
00:12:20.174 --> 00:12:21.131
How'd you do that?

229
00:12:21.305 --> 00:12:23.220
It's easy. You want to try?Yeah. I do.

230
00:12:23.307 --> 00:12:24.700
Just. uh. just put the cap

231
00:12:24.787 --> 00:12:26.223
against the table.Cap goes there.

232
00:12:26.354 --> 00:12:28.095
Firm grip on the neck.BEN: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

233
00:12:28.225 --> 00:12:30.053
So. you guys going on
any other trips?

234
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.186
Hold it really tight.MARGARET: Yeah.
Going to Florida.

235
00:12:32.273 --> 00:12:34.101
You got to hold it really tight.
And then slam on it.

236
00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:38.583
Ow. Damn it.All right. Try again.

237
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.542
Next year.
maybe you can join us for that.

238
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:41.717
Oh. nice.THOMAS: Try again.

239
00:12:42.239 --> 00:12:43.763
The kids could stay
with your parents.BEN: I'm gonna get this.

240
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:44.894
You almost got it.BEN: Jesus Christ.

241
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:46.243
It's all right. I can do it.

242
00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:48.550
No. I can open my own beer.THOMAS: I'm just...
I'm just saying.

243
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.726
Try again.BEN: Super tight.

244
00:12:50.857 --> 00:12:51.771
Very tight.

245
00:12:51.988 --> 00:12:53.773
Ow! But I did it.THOMAS: There you go.

246
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.904
You did it.MARGARET: Oh. wow.

247
00:12:54.991 --> 00:12:56.427
You did it in. uh.
in your own way.

248
00:12:56.514 --> 00:12:58.299
That's fantastic.

249
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.910
Yay? BEN: I guess you just got
to do it harder.

250
00:13:01.084 --> 00:13:03.260
You got to do it harder.
There you go. man.

251
00:13:03.391 --> 00:13:05.132
Oh. cheers.ELLIE: College.

252
00:13:05.959 --> 00:13:07.047
Babe. come on.

253
00:13:07.482 --> 00:13:08.700
Do you really have to keep
doing that

254
00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:09.919
on someone else's furniture?

255
00:13:12.052 --> 00:13:13.880
No. yeah. you're right.
Uh. that would be...

256
00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:15.751
so inappropriate.

257
00:13:27.067 --> 00:13:28.633
Hey.
you want to go.

258
00:13:28.764 --> 00:13:30.070
um. toss some horseshoes?Yep.

259
00:13:30.157 --> 00:13:31.767
Uh. wh... okay.

260
00:13:37.947 --> 00:13:40.297
Ellie. would you like to help me
make a salad?

261
00:13:41.733 --> 00:13:42.952
Sure.

262
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:48.436
Okay.
I chop. you spill.

263
00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:50.307
It's... honestly. it's nothing.

264
00:13:50.525 --> 00:13:52.135
He's been acting so weird

265
00:13:52.222 --> 00:13:54.094
since we got here.

266
00:13:54.224 --> 00:13:56.444
You. too. So out with it.

267
00:13:56.792 --> 00:13:58.968
I really. really shouldn't.

268
00:13:59.316 --> 00:14:00.578
"Oh. I really shouldn't."

269
00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:04.365
You want to tell me so bad.
Look at you.

270
00:14:04.626 --> 00:14:08.108
Plus. you know. it might...
might make you feel better.

271
00:14:11.241 --> 00:14:13.243
Okay. we're gonna need
some drinks.

272
00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:15.419
Wine.Yeah.

273
00:14:16.029 --> 00:14:18.118
Hey. about this morning.
can't thank you enough.

274
00:14:18.248 --> 00:14:19.597
Ah. dude. it was nothing.

275
00:14:20.163 --> 00:14:24.124
Um. so Spencer...
he's a little crazy.

276
00:14:24.472 --> 00:14:26.213
Oh. he's a lunatic. Absolutely.

277
00:14:26.343 --> 00:14:29.042
But you're great with him.
Uncle Ben.

278
00:14:29.172 --> 00:14:30.130
Eh.

279
00:14:30.913 --> 00:14:32.001
So?

280
00:14:32.828 --> 00:14:34.047
When are you. uh.
when are you guys

281
00:14:34.134 --> 00:14:35.135
gonna have your own?

282
00:14:35.222 --> 00:14:36.919
Uh. I... you know.

283
00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:39.966
I don't know that we're really
quite ready for that yet. so...

284
00:14:40.096 --> 00:14:41.358
Bro. nobody's ever ready.

285
00:14:41.489 --> 00:14:42.490
Like. I think of our parents.

286
00:14:42.838 --> 00:14:44.666
and I'm surprised
we even made it to adulthood.

287
00:14:44.796 --> 00:14:47.495
No. you just got to.
you got to jump in.

288
00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:50.672
Headfirst. De cabeza.

289
00:14:53.022 --> 00:14:56.069
So. Kyle...Mm-hmm.

290
00:14:58.462 --> 00:14:59.724
...and Katie?

291
00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:01.639
Mm-hmm.

292
00:15:02.466 --> 00:15:04.033
How exactly did that work?

293
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.992
A lot of alcohol.

294
00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:07.863
And the kids
were at my parents'.

295
00:15:07.994 --> 00:15:10.213
I can't believe Katie.
Kyle maybe.

296
00:15:10.344 --> 00:15:11.867
Oh. Kyle definitely.

297
00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:13.869
But. I mean. you know.
they got married after college

298
00:15:13.956 --> 00:15:15.088
just like Thomas and me.

299
00:15:15.262 --> 00:15:17.220
W... Was it just.
like. all of you

300
00:15:17.307 --> 00:15:18.787
in one big. like...

301
00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:21.311
blob or...

302
00:15:23.444 --> 00:15:24.619
I want details.

303
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:27.100
I need another sip.

304
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.496
So you and Kyle are on the bed.

305
00:15:32.627 --> 00:15:35.151
And where are Thomas and Katie
during all this?

306
00:15:35.282 --> 00:15:37.893
Uh. on the chair in the corner.Mm-hmm.

307
00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:40.243
That little blue one?

308
00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:41.462
Okay.

309
00:15:41.897 --> 00:15:44.508
And so. she's. like.
sitting in Thomas's lap...

310
00:15:44.595 --> 00:15:45.857
Mm-hmm....her back to me

311
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.469
clothes still on. mind you.Mm-hmm.

312
00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:53.778
And Thomas. you know.
starts kissing her neck.

313
00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:56.607
and then looks over
her shoulder at me.

314
00:15:56.694 --> 00:15:58.870
and it just felt like.

315
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:02.396
"This is it. Let's... let's go."

316
00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:07.140
I'm not opposed to it
in theory.

317
00:16:07.314 --> 00:16:10.404
It's more... in practice
I'm not so sure about.

318
00:16:10.578 --> 00:16:11.666
Uh-huh.

319
00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:14.321
You do know you still have fun
when you have kids. right?

320
00:16:15.757 --> 00:16:18.020
It's just slightly
different fun.

321
00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:21.937
I like kids.
We both like kids. It's just...

322
00:16:22.068 --> 00:16:24.940
It's kind of like
the high-end Airbnb. you know?

323
00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:27.464
It's great for the weekend.
just...

324
00:16:27.595 --> 00:16:29.945
not so sure
it's really our lifestyle.

325
00:16:30.076 --> 00:16:32.034
Yeah. you'd be surprised
how your lifestyle can change.

326
00:16:32.165 --> 00:16:33.427
Is it hard?

327
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.647
Sometimes. sure.
but it's the best thing. man.

328
00:16:36.778 --> 00:16:37.997
Mm.

329
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.304
Sometimes it feels like
it's the only thing.

330
00:16:43.524 --> 00:16:48.355
So things...
progress between Kyle and me.

331
00:16:48.485 --> 00:16:51.793
Okay. like. you took
your clothes off or...

332
00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:53.142
Mm-hmm.

333
00:16:55.188 --> 00:16:57.799
Ellie. Did you guys actually...

334
00:16:57.929 --> 00:16:59.018
Oh. we fucked.

335
00:17:03.848 --> 00:17:06.634
And?

336
00:17:06.938 --> 00:17:08.549
And it was great.

337
00:17:09.202 --> 00:17:11.595
Until I look over
at Thomas and Katie.

338
00:17:11.726 --> 00:17:14.685
and they're just watching us.
sort of...

339
00:17:15.686 --> 00:17:18.689
I don't know. like.
half-heartedly canoodling.

340
00:17:19.386 --> 00:17:20.300
Canoodling?

341
00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.564
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. it was weird. Margo.

342
00:17:23.912 --> 00:17:26.045
But did you finish?

343
00:17:26.567 --> 00:17:30.223
So. I told Thomas
that I faked it.

344
00:17:32.138 --> 00:17:33.661
Off the fucking charts.

345
00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:36.185
Okay. Kyle.

346
00:17:36.316 --> 00:17:38.274
Yes.

347
00:17:38.405 --> 00:17:42.496
And so it's been weird
ever since.

348
00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:45.064
Mm-hmm.
I mean. you saw. I just...

349
00:17:45.673 --> 00:17:49.503
I don't know. I... I feel like
I cheated on him or something.

350
00:17:50.591 --> 00:17:52.245
He'll get over it.Mm.

351
00:17:52.897 --> 00:17:54.725
Like. he hasn't
touched me since.

352
00:17:55.161 --> 00:17:57.946
To be fair. you know.
it's just been busy with work...Hmm.

353
00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:00.035
...and the kids and my parents.

354
00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.559
We haven't really
had any time to ourselves.

355
00:18:03.386 --> 00:18:07.086
Well. why don't the kids
just stay here tonight?

356
00:18:08.565 --> 00:18:09.566
Could they?

357
00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.873
I mean. I don't see why not.

358
00:18:12.003 --> 00:18:13.483
Ben actually seems
to kind of like

359
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.789
having them around.

360
00:18:15.006 --> 00:18:16.747
Yes. he does. doesn't he?

361
00:18:16.878 --> 00:18:18.140
Don't get any ideas.

362
00:18:18.358 --> 00:18:19.794
We're still not
having any of our own.

363
00:18:19.924 --> 00:18:21.056
Mm.

364
00:18:21.274 --> 00:18:23.493
You know. we're focusing
on our careers right now.

365
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.235
and we're not kid people
at the end of the day.

366
00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:28.542
We like to go out
on a whim and travel

367
00:18:28.672 --> 00:18:30.500
and. you know. all the stuff
you and I used to do

368
00:18:30.587 --> 00:18:31.632
before you...

369
00:18:32.676 --> 00:18:34.591
Before I had kids.

370
00:18:35.462 --> 00:18:37.377
You know what I mean.

371
00:18:39.509 --> 00:18:42.773
Well. maybe it's for the best.
you know?

372
00:18:47.387 --> 00:18:49.084
A double Cancer?

373
00:18:49.215 --> 00:18:50.825
Yep. the other one's
a Cancer. too.

374
00:18:50.955 --> 00:18:52.827
It's just... it's not
common when you're. like.

375
00:18:52.914 --> 00:18:55.090
a triple of one sign.

376
00:18:55.221 --> 00:18:56.439
Is it a bad sign?

377
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.833
Yes. BEN: Uh. focus. Oh! Hey.

378
00:18:58.963 --> 00:19:00.443
All right. Whoa. whoa.
whoa. Careful. dude.

379
00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:02.097
You're gonna whack yourself
in the head. okay?

380
00:19:02.184 --> 00:19:04.099
Look. took me a while
to figure it out.

381
00:19:04.534 --> 00:19:06.797
but you'll get the hang of it.
Just practice.

382
00:19:06.928 --> 00:19:09.104
You're doing great. Um. just...

383
00:19:13.456 --> 00:19:15.719
Ah. you... I know.
It's just frustrating.

384
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.113
Great. No. Ooh. watch your face.
Ooh. sh...

385
00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:19.767
All right. go get them.

386
00:19:19.854 --> 00:19:22.683
I was thinking maybe the kids
could stay with us tonight.

387
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.685
Say what?

388
00:19:25.294 --> 00:19:27.340
That's a great idea.

389
00:19:29.951 --> 00:19:32.432
Yeah. Sure. That should be fun.

390
00:19:33.346 --> 00:19:35.478
Won't that be fun. guys?
A little sleepover?

391
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.570
You guys can stay...
Okay?

392
00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:43.182
Can I get
some verbal confirmation?

393
00:19:45.662 --> 00:19:47.403
No. that's all right.
You don't have to turn around.

394
00:19:47.534 --> 00:19:49.884
Uh. yeah. I think
we've already been replaced.

395
00:19:50.014 --> 00:19:51.451
Mm-hmm.BEN: That's it.

396
00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:52.887
Okay. Okay. okay.

397
00:19:54.018 --> 00:19:55.542
Okay. Hand them over.

398
00:19:57.065 --> 00:19:58.022
Hold my beer.

399
00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:04.333
Devil sticks. See?
Just finesse. finesse.

400
00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.726
You just got to feel
them sticks.

401
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.162
Give it a flippity flip.

402
00:20:07.293 --> 00:20:09.425
Okay? You want to see
the helicopter?

403
00:20:12.602 --> 00:20:14.387
How about them hot moves?

404
00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:18.217
Yeah? Yeah? See how easy?
Remember the balance?

405
00:20:19.043 --> 00:20:22.046
Just keep practicing.
and you will get the hang of it.

406
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.571
Promise.
Well. I'm about ready to go.

407
00:20:26.094 --> 00:20:27.835
Right now?Mm-hmm.

408
00:20:27.922 --> 00:20:29.532
Okay? Yeah?Yeah.

409
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:34.494
All right. kids.
we're gonna go. so be good.

410
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:37.061
So. this
is the simple stuff.

411
00:20:37.192 --> 00:20:38.454
It's for babies. okay?

412
00:20:38.585 --> 00:20:39.890
Once you get good.

413
00:20:39.977 --> 00:20:42.545
you start doing the flips. okay?

414
00:20:42.676 --> 00:20:43.807
Oh!MARGARET: Ooh.

415
00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:45.592
Nice. Demon Sword.BEN: Wait. I have a Demon Sword.

416
00:20:45.853 --> 00:20:47.507
Uh. wait.

417
00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:49.422
...that he's put his card down
or do we have to wait...

418
00:20:49.509 --> 00:20:51.250
You can't do that.MARGARET: You had two
Demon Swords?

419
00:20:51.337 --> 00:20:52.729
I'm gonna referee.You can't do that.

420
00:20:52.903 --> 00:20:54.122
There's no order.
This isn't Uno.

421
00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:56.385
Guys. it's...
it's not that complicated.

422
00:20:56.603 --> 00:21:00.084
Unless you get the Rabid Queen.
That changes everything.

423
00:21:00.215 --> 00:21:01.738
Ooh. what happens
if you get the Rabid Queen?

424
00:21:01.869 --> 00:21:02.826
Yeah. what happens?

425
00:21:02.957 --> 00:21:04.306
You don't want to know.

426
00:21:05.655 --> 00:21:07.483
We just asked.Here.

427
00:21:07.918 --> 00:21:09.877
Moving on. I'm playing this one.

428
00:21:10.138 --> 00:21:11.487
Normally.

429
00:21:11.618 --> 00:21:13.402
Here?LUCY: No. Let me...

430
00:21:14.142 --> 00:21:15.404
Quiero volver.

431
00:21:15.535 --> 00:21:17.014
What's up?

432
00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:20.235
Quiero volver.I don't know. What's that mean?

433
00:21:20.366 --> 00:21:21.845
He wants to go back.

434
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.501
Back where?LUCY: The bright place.

435
00:21:26.154 --> 00:21:28.504
The place that shines.
In the woods.

436
00:21:28.896 --> 00:21:30.158
Oh. that old fort?

437
00:21:30.332 --> 00:21:31.899
Nah. dude. I don't think
we're gonna go back there.

438
00:21:31.986 --> 00:21:33.640
Ah. we got lots of fun things
we can do here.

439
00:21:33.727 --> 00:21:35.337
like teach you some new tricks
with your sticks.

440
00:21:35.511 --> 00:21:37.426
See if you can pick those up.

441
00:21:37.557 --> 00:21:39.341
I got a lot of cool stuff...

442
00:21:47.697 --> 00:21:49.133
Sounds great. Ben.

443
00:21:49.264 --> 00:21:51.571
I'm gonna pull.
I feel like...Okay.

444
00:21:52.267 --> 00:21:54.313
Oh. shit!Good.

445
00:21:54.443 --> 00:21:56.576
I got the Serpentine Lord.BEN: Mm.

446
00:21:56.706 --> 00:21:58.578
That's bad. right?You swore.

447
00:21:59.143 --> 00:22:00.406
Um...

448
00:22:00.623 --> 00:22:02.886
if I give you 20 bucks.
will you not tell your mom?

449
00:22:03.017 --> 00:22:04.453
You're bribing children now?

450
00:22:06.934 --> 00:22:08.762
Guys. let's just play this game.

451
00:22:08.979 --> 00:22:10.111
Yeah. sorry.I win.

452
00:22:16.683 --> 00:22:17.771
MARGARET:
We'll be right out here

453
00:22:17.858 --> 00:22:19.250
if you need anything. okay?

454
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.558
Do you want the door open
or closed?

455
00:22:22.993 --> 00:22:25.256
Closed.Okay. Good night.

456
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.482
They're out like a light.

457
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:36.006
That wasn't so bad.

458
00:22:37.094 --> 00:22:38.313
Kids are fine.

459
00:22:38.574 --> 00:22:40.489
It's what it does to the parents
that I don't like.

460
00:22:41.316 --> 00:22:42.709
You talking about Thomas?

461
00:22:43.144 --> 00:22:44.319
No. I'm talking about
both of them.

462
00:22:44.406 --> 00:22:45.799
They were at each other's
throats all day.

463
00:22:47.757 --> 00:22:51.370
Well. that is not
the kids' fault.

464
00:22:52.806 --> 00:22:55.591
Wait. wait. wait.
What do you know?

465
00:22:56.897 --> 00:22:58.289
What aren't you telling me?

466
00:23:00.553 --> 00:23:02.685
Why don't we enjoy
the night air?

467
00:23:03.425 --> 00:23:05.427
Okay.

468
00:23:09.475 --> 00:23:11.477
Wow. Just wow.

469
00:23:11.564 --> 00:23:13.130
I know.

470
00:23:13.914 --> 00:23:15.306
Kyle I can see. but...

471
00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:16.569
Right?

472
00:23:16.656 --> 00:23:18.571
Makes me wonder about

473
00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:21.138
all those date nights
my parents had when I was a kid.

474
00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:31.453
What?

475
00:23:32.454 --> 00:23:33.716
Do you want kids?

476
00:23:33.934 --> 00:23:36.502
What?

477
00:23:37.807 --> 00:23:38.808
I...

478
00:23:40.506 --> 00:23:41.637
I mean...

479
00:23:42.682 --> 00:23:44.814
well. you kind of decided
this for us.

480
00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:46.033
See. that.

481
00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:51.430
That there.
I made the decision. not us.

482
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:55.042
You know. I see how great
you are with Lucy and Spencer.

483
00:23:55.129 --> 00:23:56.347
and I just...

484
00:23:56.522 --> 00:23:59.525
I wonder if it's something
I'm keeping you from.

485
00:23:59.873 --> 00:24:01.788
You know? Like. I just...
I want to make sure

486
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:04.443
that we're still
on the same page.

487
00:24:07.097 --> 00:24:09.056
Look. we don't have to decide
tonight. all right?

488
00:24:09.143 --> 00:24:10.536
We've got time.

489
00:24:10.666 --> 00:24:13.103
I mean. you got time.
I have an expiration date.

490
00:24:14.888 --> 00:24:16.498
Fair enough. Okay.

491
00:24:16.803 --> 00:24:18.587
Okay.

492
00:24:19.414 --> 00:24:21.982
You want to talk about it?
Let's talk about it.

493
00:24:25.768 --> 00:24:28.423
I mean. yes.
I don't... I don't know. I...

494
00:24:29.772 --> 00:24:31.121
I just don't want to feel like

495
00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:33.210
I'm the only person
that has to figure it out.

496
00:24:35.038 --> 00:24:36.344
What do you mean by that?

497
00:24:41.305 --> 00:24:42.306
Never mind.

498
00:24:44.874 --> 00:24:47.877
Okay.

499
00:24:52.969 --> 00:24:55.668
Oh. I just feel
so real right now.

500
00:24:55.755 --> 00:25:00.324
What do you mean?Like... connected.

501
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:02.892
That's the word.
I feel connected.

502
00:25:03.937 --> 00:25:05.504
Connected to what?

503
00:25:07.027 --> 00:25:10.378
This. This... fire.

504
00:25:10.944 --> 00:25:13.120
These trees. these bugs.

505
00:25:13.207 --> 00:25:17.254
Um. I want to feel this way
all the time.

506
00:25:17.341 --> 00:25:19.213
I just feel like
I'm a part of everything.

507
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.998
like everything is connected

508
00:25:22.085 --> 00:25:24.784
and it's bigger than me.
you know?

509
00:25:24.871 --> 00:25:28.048
And you think about the city
and how disjointed it is.

510
00:25:28.135 --> 00:25:29.484
and... I don't know.

511
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:31.051
When I think about it
sometimes.

512
00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:34.489
it just makes me...

513
00:25:36.447 --> 00:25:40.626
Love... you are very high.

514
00:25:43.106 --> 00:25:45.239
No.Oh. no. I... I promise.

515
00:25:45.369 --> 00:25:47.197
You got to trust me on this one.

516
00:25:47.284 --> 00:25:50.113
I'm a little high.

517
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.593
You're high as hell.

518
00:25:51.854 --> 00:25:53.595
Come here. Okay.

519
00:25:53.682 --> 00:25:56.076
Let's feel connected.

520
00:25:58.252 --> 00:26:01.255
I'll take that.I'm a one-hit wonder.

521
00:26:01.342 --> 00:26:02.909
You took like six hits.

522
00:26:34.331 --> 00:26:36.246
Oh. good morning.

523
00:26:36.551 --> 00:26:38.597
Here you go.

524
00:26:39.554 --> 00:26:41.556
Mm. thank you.BEN: Yeah.

525
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:46.474
You look incredible
this morning.

526
00:26:46.692 --> 00:26:48.258
You're a liar.

527
00:26:51.522 --> 00:26:53.568
Do we have Advil?

528
00:26:54.743 --> 00:26:56.702
Yeah. We do.

529
00:26:57.964 --> 00:27:01.576
You're a saint. you know that?

530
00:27:21.596 --> 00:27:23.467
Yes. Get it. girl.

531
00:27:34.043 --> 00:27:35.305
The kids awake?

532
00:27:35.436 --> 00:27:37.264
No. they're. uh. still
sleeping. I think.

533
00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:42.225
Lucky they sleep so late.

534
00:27:45.707 --> 00:27:47.970
Rise and shine. sleepyheads.

535
00:27:55.761 --> 00:27:57.197
Lucy? Spencer?

536
00:27:57.719 --> 00:28:01.070
I think I can convince Ben
to make us some pancakes.

537
00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:05.335
Luce? Spencer?

538
00:28:07.642 --> 00:28:09.818
I'm gonna open the door. okay?

539
00:28:21.308 --> 00:28:22.526
They're not in there.

540
00:28:23.049 --> 00:28:25.616
Did you check the bathroom?Mm-hmm. Yeah.

541
00:28:26.617 --> 00:28:29.142
Uh. maybe they're just playing
outside or something.

542
00:28:41.763 --> 00:28:43.243
I don't see them out there.

543
00:28:43.939 --> 00:28:45.027
Really?

544
00:28:45.854 --> 00:28:47.726
Maybe they're. um...
Go check and see

545
00:28:47.813 --> 00:28:49.031
if they're playing
over by the pond.

546
00:29:08.181 --> 00:29:09.573
You don't see them?

547
00:29:12.707 --> 00:29:15.536
Huh.

548
00:29:18.278 --> 00:29:20.715
Okay. I'm freaking out.

549
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.369
No. no. You know what?

550
00:29:22.543 --> 00:29:24.806
Remember they were playing
hide-and-seek yesterday?

551
00:29:25.067 --> 00:29:26.852
Probably just hiding
and want us to...

552
00:29:26.982 --> 00:29:29.158
Right. well... Lucy.
we're not playing right now!...find them.

553
00:29:29.332 --> 00:29:33.946
Spencer?Hey. guys? Hey. Breakfast.

554
00:29:38.341 --> 00:29:39.473
Lucy?

555
00:29:42.824 --> 00:29:44.521
They're not in any
of the closets.

556
00:29:44.608 --> 00:29:45.958
Okay. wait.

557
00:29:46.088 --> 00:29:47.829
Look. hey. they probably
just went back over

558
00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.744
to Thomas and Ellie's place.She just texted me.

559
00:29:49.831 --> 00:29:51.398
There's no way
they're over there.

560
00:29:55.184 --> 00:29:56.707
The kids' shoes are gone.What?

561
00:29:57.883 --> 00:30:00.363
They took their shoes.No. they wouldn't have.

562
00:30:01.364 --> 00:30:04.803
They wouldn't have what. Ben?
Ben. where you gonna go?

563
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:07.196
They wouldn't have what?

564
00:30:08.067 --> 00:30:10.156
I'm just gonna check the path.
They can't have gone far.

565
00:30:10.243 --> 00:30:12.071
Okay. well. I'll go with you.

566
00:30:12.158 --> 00:30:14.725
No. no. no. stay at the house
in case they come back.

567
00:30:15.117 --> 00:30:17.424
Were they even in the cabin
when we came back in last night?

568
00:30:17.554 --> 00:30:18.947
They didn't sneak out.
all right?

569
00:30:19.034 --> 00:30:20.775
The sun came up. they thought
they'd go for a walk.

570
00:30:20.862 --> 00:30:22.342
They probably just went
back down this path.

571
00:30:22.429 --> 00:30:24.474
They can't have gone far.

572
00:30:25.693 --> 00:30:28.348
They're fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.

573
00:30:29.218 --> 00:30:30.829
We're gonna find them.

574
00:30:51.545 --> 00:30:53.547
Lucy.

575
00:30:56.855 --> 00:31:00.293
Lucy!
Spencer!

576
00:31:13.741 --> 00:31:15.003
Guys?

577
00:31:16.178 --> 00:31:19.703
Jesus Christ. there you are.
What are you guys doing in here?

578
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.882
Hey! You know you can't
be here without an adult.

579
00:31:25.971 --> 00:31:26.972
Guys.

580
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:31.498
Es brilliante.

581
00:31:33.021 --> 00:31:34.893
Okay. I need you
to come down here right now.

582
00:31:38.026 --> 00:31:39.898
No. I'm... I'm serious.
Right now.

583
00:31:41.682 --> 00:31:43.640
No. no. no. Stop! No!

584
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.384
Oh. God.

585
00:32:24.725 --> 00:32:26.292
Why aren't you answering
your phone?

586
00:32:35.518 --> 00:32:37.042
Fuck.

587
00:32:49.924 --> 00:32:51.665
Margaret.MARGARET: Where are you?

588
00:32:51.795 --> 00:32:53.884
Have you found them?
Please tell me you found them.

589
00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:58.237
I went up to the lookout. and...

590
00:32:58.367 --> 00:33:00.065
Ben? I followed the flowers.

591
00:33:00.239 --> 00:33:01.588
No. Ben. you're breaking up. I followed...

592
00:33:01.762 --> 00:33:03.938
I followed the flowers.Ben?

593
00:33:04.634 --> 00:33:06.158
I'm alm... I'm almost home.

594
00:33:11.772 --> 00:33:12.729
Hey.

595
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.471
Hey.

596
00:33:17.082 --> 00:33:18.822
Thank God.

597
00:33:19.432 --> 00:33:22.304
Thank God. No. Ben.
they're here. They're here.

598
00:33:22.391 --> 00:33:23.610
I was so sure I was gonna see

599
00:33:23.697 --> 00:33:24.828
their little bodies
floating in the lake.

600
00:33:24.915 --> 00:33:27.527
Could you even imagine?

601
00:33:27.962 --> 00:33:29.442
I... I see you.

602
00:33:30.834 --> 00:33:34.664
No. I can't. I can't imagine.

603
00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:05.217
You know
how much he loves to hike...

604
00:34:05.304 --> 00:34:07.045
...so he had to fit one in.

605
00:34:07.175 --> 00:34:09.743
Damn. Ben.
you look like hell.

606
00:34:09.873 --> 00:34:11.310
I was just telling Ellie

607
00:34:11.397 --> 00:34:13.442
how quickly the kids
petered out this morning.

608
00:34:13.573 --> 00:34:15.575
Uh. yeah. yeah. yeah.

609
00:34:15.705 --> 00:34:17.838
And how you took them out
for a hike. brought them back

610
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.492
and then went out on your own.

611
00:34:20.493 --> 00:34:21.363
Right.

612
00:34:26.934 --> 00:34:28.153
You good. man?

613
00:34:28.327 --> 00:34:31.721
Uh. yeah.
Th... They're... they're okay?

614
00:34:32.113 --> 00:34:34.855
Yeah. except they're bouncing
off the freaking walls.

615
00:34:34.985 --> 00:34:37.727
What'd you guys give them
for breakfast. pure sugar?

616
00:34:37.858 --> 00:34:39.903
Wait for me.ELLIE: No...

617
00:34:40.034 --> 00:34:42.210
I'm busy. I'm... Stop. No.

618
00:34:42.776 --> 00:34:43.951
Okay.

619
00:34:44.473 --> 00:34:45.996
I'm coming to get you!

620
00:34:46.127 --> 00:34:49.130
Well. it looks like
you two enjoyed your night off.

621
00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:02.317
Okay.
We're still standing here.

622
00:35:02.448 --> 00:35:04.972
Mom. why is Ben staring at me?

623
00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:22.946
I saw them.

624
00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:29.518
I know I saw them.

625
00:35:59.853 --> 00:36:01.071
Hey. guys.

626
00:36:03.987 --> 00:36:07.382
Did. uh...
you sleep all right last night?

627
00:36:08.035 --> 00:36:10.951
Of course we did. silly.Dead bugs.

628
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.649
Those aren't dead.

629
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.439
Like I said.

630
00:36:26.836 --> 00:36:30.318
Uh... L...
let me ask you something.

631
00:36:30.449 --> 00:36:33.408
Did you two go for a little walk
this morning?

632
00:36:41.547 --> 00:36:43.070
What was that all about?

633
00:36:43.723 --> 00:36:45.203
It's our secret language.

634
00:36:45.986 --> 00:36:47.466
You want to know
what he said to me?

635
00:36:47.596 --> 00:36:48.771
Stop messing around.
I need to know

636
00:36:48.858 --> 00:36:49.990
where you went this morning.

637
00:36:53.602 --> 00:36:54.908
Hold this under your chin.

638
00:36:55.038 --> 00:36:56.692
If your chin glows yellow...Okay. did you go back

639
00:36:56.823 --> 00:36:57.780
to the fort. all right?

640
00:36:58.041 --> 00:36:59.739
If you did. it's okay.
I just need to know.

641
00:36:59.869 --> 00:37:03.221
Do the thing first.
then I'll tell you. Promise.

642
00:37:07.703 --> 00:37:09.139
Está brillando.

643
00:37:09.923 --> 00:37:11.707
Means you have a secret. too.

644
00:37:11.838 --> 00:37:13.056
Okay. well?

645
00:37:13.666 --> 00:37:15.102
Yes. we went there.

646
00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:17.626
But you won't tell on us.
will you?

647
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:20.063
Wait. what did you do there?

648
00:37:20.194 --> 00:37:21.413
Careful. Ben.

649
00:37:22.414 --> 00:37:25.068
Or we'll run off
and join the circus.

650
00:37:29.812 --> 00:37:31.858
Hey. Little man.

651
00:37:33.163 --> 00:37:34.730
Careful with those. all right?
They're heavy.

652
00:37:34.817 --> 00:37:36.515
If you hit yourself in the head.
it'll hurt.

653
00:37:37.907 --> 00:37:39.518
Hey. just don't go so high.

654
00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:42.390
Stop.

655
00:37:54.402 --> 00:37:55.882
Is it glowing?

656
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:10.940
I'm starving.THOMAS: Mm-hmm.

657
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:12.812
Yeah. you think
that I'd leave this?

658
00:38:12.942 --> 00:38:14.422
No.ELLIE: That's not how it works.

659
00:38:14.553 --> 00:38:16.163
But this is why. like.
I live in a house.

660
00:38:19.427 --> 00:38:22.648
Oh. I'm full.

661
00:38:38.403 --> 00:38:39.491
You all right?

662
00:38:40.666 --> 00:38:43.843
Ben? Ben.

663
00:38:46.585 --> 00:38:49.979
Um... what...
what were they doing?

664
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.373
The kids when you found them.

665
00:38:52.852 --> 00:38:54.070
Oh. I didn't.

666
00:38:54.897 --> 00:38:56.812
Ellie said that they came
into the cabin

667
00:38:56.899 --> 00:38:58.074
right before they saw us.

668
00:38:58.423 --> 00:39:01.077
She thought we sent them over
to get them up in the morning.

669
00:39:01.208 --> 00:39:02.122
They must have been

670
00:39:02.252 --> 00:39:03.776
in the backwoods
behind the cabin

671
00:39:03.906 --> 00:39:05.168
or something
and we just missed them.

672
00:39:05.255 --> 00:39:06.996
They... they went...
they went back there.

673
00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:09.912
Where?T... To that old fort. the pit.

674
00:39:11.044 --> 00:39:13.176
"The place that shines."
They told me that.

675
00:39:13.307 --> 00:39:15.788
That's a really strenuous hike
for two little kids to make.

676
00:39:15.918 --> 00:39:17.224
They're probably
just putting you on.

677
00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:19.879
Wait. you haven't noticed?What?

678
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.272
The way they look at you now?
The... the... the nosebleeds?

679
00:39:22.403 --> 00:39:23.883
And... and Spencer
with the sticks.

680
00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:25.363
He couldn't fucking keep
those things in the air

681
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:26.451
for two seconds yesterday.

682
00:39:26.538 --> 00:39:27.887
and now he's a goddamn
majorette.

683
00:39:27.974 --> 00:39:29.279
That's not possible.

684
00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:31.543
I was really scared
this morning. too.

685
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.023
but they're here now
and they're safe and it's fine.

686
00:39:34.154 --> 00:39:36.983
No. I... I need you
to just listen to me

687
00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.115
'cause what I'm gonna tell you
is gonna sound impossible.

688
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.857
Just please hear me.

689
00:39:44.425 --> 00:39:47.776
I saw them jump into that pit.

690
00:39:48.124 --> 00:39:53.391
I saw them just tip
right into it like they were in

691
00:39:53.521 --> 00:39:55.915
some sort of a trance.

692
00:39:56.045 --> 00:39:59.005
I don't think that's them
out there anymore.

693
00:40:11.191 --> 00:40:12.410
Margo.

694
00:40:15.369 --> 00:40:16.370
What?

695
00:40:17.676 --> 00:40:19.242
How you been feeling lately?

696
00:40:19.939 --> 00:40:21.767
Are you serious right now?

697
00:40:22.724 --> 00:40:24.030
I'm just asking.

698
00:40:25.335 --> 00:40:27.207
Look. you've seen that.

699
00:40:27.294 --> 00:40:29.339
That is not this.
This is not that.

700
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:31.994
I don't know what this is.Yeah. but you don't believe me.

701
00:40:32.125 --> 00:40:35.433
I think you were
in an agitated state.

702
00:40:35.563 --> 00:40:40.307
and you maybe saw something
that you can't quite explain

703
00:40:40.394 --> 00:40:44.442
or process
in some rational way just yet.

704
00:40:45.486 --> 00:40:48.881
"Rationally." Yeah. no.
Uh. way to parse words. Margo.

705
00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:55.975
Look. we're both really...
a little overtired right now.

706
00:40:56.802 --> 00:40:58.368
You know.
why don't you lie down?

707
00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:00.458
Have a nap.

708
00:41:00.675 --> 00:41:03.461
Yeah. No. you're right.

709
00:41:03.548 --> 00:41:05.332
I should probably
just get some rest.

710
00:41:05.463 --> 00:41:06.681
Okay.

711
00:41:35.405 --> 00:41:37.103
Jesus Christ.

712
00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:38.757
You shouldn't swear.

713
00:41:39.018 --> 00:41:41.586
What are you doing in here?

714
00:41:42.282 --> 00:41:44.110
Just wanted to see
what you were up to.

715
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.200
Okay. well. I'm not in the mood.
so just get out.

716
00:41:47.461 --> 00:41:49.507
But we want to play
a game with you.

717
00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.292
What game?

718
00:42:29.416 --> 00:42:31.157
Did you ever play.
like. powder-puff?

719
00:42:31.287 --> 00:42:32.680
Why'd they call it
"Powder-puff?"

720
00:42:32.854 --> 00:42:34.247
I don't know.
'Cause they have to call it.

721
00:42:34.508 --> 00:42:36.162
like. a little bitchy name
'cause you're a girl.

722
00:42:36.466 --> 00:42:38.468
I don't know.That's what I was thinking.
Like. why isn't it just

723
00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:41.210
"Girls football?"It's called "girlie girl
girl football."

724
00:42:41.297 --> 00:42:43.473
"Do you play football
or do you play powder-puff?"

725
00:42:45.475 --> 00:42:46.389
I don't even remember

726
00:42:46.738 --> 00:42:47.956
what was on the back
of my jersey. like...

727
00:42:48.217 --> 00:42:49.915
Hey.

728
00:42:50.872 --> 00:42:52.570
I thought
you were gonna lie down.

729
00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.051
Uh. I didn't want to miss
all the fun.

730
00:43:01.622 --> 00:43:03.581
So. I think
that would be good.

731
00:43:04.016 --> 00:43:06.453
Hey. They ever. uh...

732
00:43:09.238 --> 00:43:11.501
They ever scare you?Those two?

733
00:43:11.676 --> 00:43:13.808
Yeah. Absolutely. All the time.

734
00:43:13.939 --> 00:43:18.073
No. not them.
Kids. Your... your kids.

735
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.119
What. you mean like...

736
00:43:20.249 --> 00:43:22.121
I don't know. just. like--
Oh. geez!

737
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:23.731
Okay.

738
00:43:24.776 --> 00:43:26.995
Good timing. Spence.

739
00:43:27.213 --> 00:43:29.041
I'm hungry.THOMAS: All right. just...

740
00:43:29.171 --> 00:43:30.956
Just have some chips.
but don't overdo it.

741
00:43:31.217 --> 00:43:32.261
Dinner's almost ready.

742
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.915
Hey. Ben!

743
00:43:36.352 --> 00:43:38.050
Just like a super. like. tiny...

744
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.181
Look at me.

745
00:43:40.792 --> 00:43:41.836
Whoa. hey! Hey!

746
00:43:44.578 --> 00:43:45.753
What?

747
00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.626
Um...

748
00:43:52.064 --> 00:43:53.326
Do you want a beer?

749
00:43:54.457 --> 00:43:56.329
Uh. no. we're drinking wine.

750
00:43:59.724 --> 00:44:00.855
Cool.

751
00:44:03.466 --> 00:44:04.685
You want some?
They're my favorite.

752
00:44:05.381 --> 00:44:09.690
Jesus Christ. No.But aren't you hungry. Ben?

753
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.003
Hey. Not everybody wants
to spoil their dinner. bud.

754
00:44:19.613 --> 00:44:20.832
You feeling all right?

755
00:44:21.571 --> 00:44:23.051
Yeah. no. I'm...

756
00:44:23.573 --> 00:44:24.792
...just tired.

757
00:44:26.011 --> 00:44:28.361
Excuse me. young lady.
What do you think you're doing?

758
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:30.580
Oh. my God.

759
00:44:30.798 --> 00:44:34.323
What... Lucy.
That was inappropriate.

760
00:44:35.324 --> 00:44:36.717
And amazing.

761
00:44:36.848 --> 00:44:38.153
Thank you.

762
00:44:43.463 --> 00:44:45.987
That's a really good pour.
Too good.

763
00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:58.608
For you. Daddy.

764
00:44:58.957 --> 00:45:00.741
No. no. no.Oh. my God.
What the hell. dude?

765
00:45:01.002 --> 00:45:02.787
Whoa.THOMAS: The hell's your problem?

766
00:45:02.917 --> 00:45:04.658
Uh. hey. wait.
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

767
00:45:04.745 --> 00:45:06.878
Just show. um. show them.

768
00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:10.142
Show them!Hey. don't yell at my son.

769
00:45:10.272 --> 00:45:12.100
Ben. what are you doing?

770
00:45:12.231 --> 00:45:15.016
Give me the bottle.
Give me the goddamn...

771
00:45:15.147 --> 00:45:16.322
Hey. Ben!Hey!

772
00:45:16.409 --> 00:45:17.715
Hands off him!BEN: Give me the goddamn bottle.

773
00:45:17.845 --> 00:45:19.629
Ow!All right. hey. look.

774
00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.153
Hey. Ben!What?

775
00:45:21.675 --> 00:45:23.242
You're on mood stabilizers.
So what?

776
00:45:24.504 --> 00:45:26.245
Wait. th... these...
these were empty.

777
00:45:26.985 --> 00:45:30.466
He-- You showed me--
She was gonna put the. um...

778
00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.425
them into...SPENCER: My hand.

779
00:45:32.512 --> 00:45:35.080
He hurt my hand.Jesus Christ. Ben.

780
00:45:35.167 --> 00:45:36.603
What's wrong with you?
Are you okay?

781
00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:38.170
I thought they were candy.

782
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.475
No. they're fucking with me.

783
00:45:39.606 --> 00:45:41.608
Ben. he's nine.No. Wh... Whatever he is.

784
00:45:41.695 --> 00:45:42.652
he's fucking with me.

785
00:45:43.131 --> 00:45:44.698
He showed me this bottle.
It was empty. all right?

786
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:46.613
And she was gonna put
them in... into your drink.

787
00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:49.181
and somehow he got the pills...
you got the pills back in here.

788
00:45:49.311 --> 00:45:51.400
Somehow he put them back in here
to make me look like--

789
00:45:51.487 --> 00:45:53.794
To what? To make me overdose?
Is that what you're saying.

790
00:45:53.881 --> 00:45:55.230
that my kids were gonna
make me overdose?

791
00:45:55.404 --> 00:45:56.797
I... I don't.
I don't. I don't...

792
00:45:56.928 --> 00:45:59.626
Just breathe. Okay?
Take a breath.

793
00:46:10.419 --> 00:46:11.899
They went out on their own
this morning.

794
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.987
Ben.What?

795
00:46:13.074 --> 00:46:14.075
Yeah.
they... they went out.

796
00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:15.860
What are you talking about?BEN: No. no. they...

797
00:46:15.947 --> 00:46:17.470
they snuck out.
and... and I went after them

798
00:46:17.557 --> 00:46:19.602
to the... to the ruins.
And you know what I saw?

799
00:46:19.733 --> 00:46:20.778
No.Yes.

800
00:46:21.039 --> 00:46:22.823
I saw them jump into the pit.
And then I saw

801
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.521
your broken little bodies at
the bottom of that fucking pit!

802
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.262
Ben. shut the fuck up!That's what--

803
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.264
Shut up. Shut up.

804
00:46:32.833 --> 00:46:34.182
Okay. Uh...

805
00:46:35.314 --> 00:46:36.881
Kids. go... go play.

806
00:46:37.055 --> 00:46:39.927
But I want to listen.THOMAS: Lucy.

807
00:46:40.101 --> 00:46:41.320
Vamos.

808
00:46:44.845 --> 00:46:46.542
You let them go out alone?

809
00:46:46.673 --> 00:46:49.850
No. We didn't let them go out.
They just went.

810
00:46:49.981 --> 00:46:52.331
They just-- What do you mean
they just went?

811
00:46:52.505 --> 00:46:54.420
Well. when we woke up.
they were gone.

812
00:46:54.507 --> 00:46:56.509
Hold... hold on a s--
I'm... I'm missing something.

813
00:46:56.639 --> 00:46:58.859
When I texted you this morning.
why didn't you mention that?

814
00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:00.252
Well. I didn't know then.

815
00:47:00.382 --> 00:47:03.559
and we just didn't
tell you afterward.

816
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:04.778
We just didn't want to worry you

817
00:47:04.865 --> 00:47:06.171
if there was nothing
to worry about.

818
00:47:06.388 --> 00:47:08.347
Margaret. what the fuck?I'm still trying to understand

819
00:47:08.477 --> 00:47:10.218
how you let them
out of your sight like that.

820
00:47:10.305 --> 00:47:11.567
They were sleeping.
What. are we supposed

821
00:47:11.698 --> 00:47:13.352
to tie them in a tree
to protect them from bears?

822
00:47:13.482 --> 00:47:15.136
No. Ben. we wanted you
to be responsible adults.

823
00:47:15.223 --> 00:47:16.921
but clearly we made
a bad judgment call

824
00:47:17.008 --> 00:47:18.313
on you and your goddamn
mental health.

825
00:47:18.444 --> 00:47:20.794
Okay. Thomas. that's enough.

826
00:47:20.925 --> 00:47:23.014
Those are our children.
Margaret.

827
00:47:23.101 --> 00:47:24.537
Okay. maybe you don't know
what that feels like.

828
00:47:24.624 --> 00:47:27.018
but it would be really
fucking nice if you'd try.

829
00:47:27.888 --> 00:47:30.021
Okay. so because
I haven't experienced

830
00:47:30.151 --> 00:47:31.979
the miracle of childbirth.

831
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.590
I don't know what it takes
to babysit your kids?

832
00:47:34.721 --> 00:47:37.202
You don't understand
the responsibility.

833
00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:40.292
What? You say that you guys
aren't kid people

834
00:47:40.379 --> 00:47:42.642
because your jet-setting life
is so full.

835
00:47:42.772 --> 00:47:45.079
you're so focused
on your career.

836
00:47:45.514 --> 00:47:47.777
Give me a fucking break. okay?
You're not fooling anyone.

837
00:47:47.908 --> 00:47:48.996
Are you serious?

838
00:47:49.257 --> 00:47:51.085
Like you two are the paragons
of responsibility?

839
00:47:51.216 --> 00:47:52.652
Okay. you need to stop
right now.

840
00:47:52.739 --> 00:47:54.654
Oh. oh.
Mr. Moral Authority speaks.

841
00:47:54.784 --> 00:47:57.135
I'm not fucking around. Ben.BEN: Oh. great.

842
00:47:57.265 --> 00:47:58.788
I'm glad you're serious.
Then we can all talk

843
00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:00.878
about the fact that we're only
in this situation

844
00:48:00.965 --> 00:48:03.271
because the two of you
pawned your creepy-ass kids

845
00:48:03.358 --> 00:48:04.533
off on the two of us...What?

846
00:48:04.664 --> 00:48:05.883
...to save
your shitty-ass marriage.

847
00:48:06.013 --> 00:48:07.841
Okay. Ben.Oh. wait. right.

848
00:48:07.972 --> 00:48:10.365
You guys live. like. a mile
away from your parents. right?

849
00:48:10.496 --> 00:48:12.063
That's super convenient.
So then you can just

850
00:48:12.193 --> 00:48:13.934
pawn your creepy kids off
on them. too.

851
00:48:14.065 --> 00:48:15.762
whenever you guys
want to go have a foursome.

852
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:17.938
Ben.

853
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:19.897
Yeah. I'm sorry. I know.
It was more of a...

854
00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:22.290
two-and-a-half-some. right?MARGARET: Ben!

855
00:48:24.423 --> 00:48:25.903
Are you fucking kidding me?ELLIE: No.

856
00:48:26.251 --> 00:48:27.513
I...THOMAS: You...

857
00:48:27.948 --> 00:48:30.603
Babe. I'm sorry.This is fucked.

858
00:48:31.734 --> 00:48:32.997
I'm sorry.You're all fucked.

859
00:48:33.562 --> 00:48:35.086
You're all fucked!Mm.

860
00:48:37.827 --> 00:48:40.178
Ellie. I'm sorry.

861
00:48:43.224 --> 00:48:45.357
Well. I see everything's
all out on the table.

862
00:48:48.534 --> 00:48:49.622
What?

863
00:48:51.493 --> 00:48:52.668
Come on. Ben.

864
00:48:52.842 --> 00:48:54.801
You think we don't
tell each other everything?

865
00:48:55.149 --> 00:48:57.064
About your little
manic episodes?

866
00:48:57.151 --> 00:48:58.500
Ellie. shut up.

867
00:48:59.545 --> 00:49:01.460
How you went off the deep end
and lost another job?

868
00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:03.679
Ellie.ELLIE: You know.
maybe it's not that

869
00:49:03.984 --> 00:49:05.725
Margaret doesn't want
to have kids.

870
00:49:06.204 --> 00:49:08.771
Maybe she just doesn't want
to have them with you.

871
00:49:16.127 --> 00:49:17.215
Fucking nice.

872
00:49:26.398 --> 00:49:27.442
Ben.

873
00:49:51.814 --> 00:49:52.728
What's wrong?

874
00:49:52.859 --> 00:49:55.514
Stop doing that.

875
00:49:55.644 --> 00:49:57.342
I didn't mean to scare you.

876
00:49:58.778 --> 00:49:59.909
Fuck.

Hello? This is Thomas Huerta.

End of Churchill Road.

956
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:47.719
A few hours?

957
00:54:47.806 --> 00:54:50.025
Yeah. we can wait.
We'll be here.

958
00:56:06.841 --> 00:56:08.321
Margo.

959
00:56:08.452 --> 00:56:12.107
Hey. No. no. It's not me.
Hey. Hey. Hey.

960
00:56:12.194 --> 00:56:13.718
You got to believe me.

961
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.981
I don't know what to say to you.

962
00:56:16.111 --> 00:56:18.897
This all started when we...
when we went to the ruins.

963
00:56:19.332 --> 00:56:20.594
Th... Think about it.

964
00:56:20.681 --> 00:56:23.336
The kids have been obsessed
with going back there.

965
00:56:23.467 --> 00:56:25.251
"The place that shines."

966
00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:27.862
They jumped in. and something
down there took their place.

967
00:56:27.993 --> 00:56:29.951
Their bodies
must still be there.

968
00:56:30.082 --> 00:56:33.041
Oh. Ben.No. no. I'm not crazy. I'm not.

969
00:56:33.607 --> 00:56:35.261
You know. if you come with me.
you'll see.

970
00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:36.915
Come on. come on.Ben. let go of me.

971
00:56:37.002 --> 00:56:38.656
No. you just need to see.Let go of my arm.

972
00:56:38.786 --> 00:56:39.918
No. come on.Ben!

973
00:56:40.179 --> 00:56:42.442
You're just making things worse.
What will this prove?

974
00:56:42.573 --> 00:56:45.184
I need you to believe me.
I need you to be on my side.

975
00:56:46.577 --> 00:56:48.448
Fine. Fine. let's go.

976
00:56:48.535 --> 00:56:51.625
And when there's nothing there.
what then? What do we do then?

977
00:58:22.542 --> 00:58:23.848
They were there.

978
00:58:26.415 --> 00:58:29.549
Margaret.
they were just right there.

979
00:58:31.856 --> 00:58:33.466
Margaret. please.

980
00:58:36.121 --> 00:58:37.514
Do not look at me like that.

981
00:58:40.342 --> 00:58:41.953
There's nothing there. Ben.

982
00:58:42.083 --> 00:58:43.258
No. I know what I saw.

983
00:58:43.345 --> 00:58:45.478
They were right there. okay?

984
00:58:45.609 --> 00:58:48.002
Just right...
just right fucking there!

985
00:58:48.133 --> 00:58:49.961
All right. all right. okay.

986
00:58:50.091 --> 00:58:52.311
I'll j... I'll...
I can climb down and I...

987
00:58:54.661 --> 00:58:58.012
What the fuck? Okay. Okay. okay.

988
00:58:58.099 --> 00:58:59.840
I bet an animal
dragged them away or something.

989
00:58:59.927 --> 00:59:01.363
Some... Something happened!
Some...

990
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:02.756
Th... There's something
I just don't understand yet...

991
00:59:02.843 --> 00:59:04.149
Ben. Ben....but I will.

992
00:59:04.279 --> 00:59:05.585
Okay. no. no. no!
I'm gonna understand.

993
00:59:05.672 --> 00:59:08.022
and then you'll see it.Ben! Just stop!

994
00:59:09.067 --> 00:59:14.115
Even with all of the evidence
just staring right at you.

995
00:59:14.202 --> 00:59:18.511
you can't admit. you can't even
acknowledge just for one moment

996
00:59:18.598 --> 00:59:20.469
that you might be wrong!

997
00:59:21.558 --> 00:59:24.517
Everything that's happening...
it's just in your head!

998
00:59:28.521 --> 00:59:30.871
I know what I saw.

999
00:59:31.306 --> 00:59:34.092
You need to listen to me.

1000
00:59:34.701 --> 00:59:38.313
Ben. Spencer is dead.

1001
00:59:39.184 --> 00:59:42.187
He is dead.
And it's not because of

1002
00:59:42.622 --> 00:59:45.756
some old building
or a hole in the ground.

1003
00:59:45.886 --> 00:59:48.889
It's because your actions.
they have consequences.

1004
00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:53.459
Your ac... You. You did this.
Just you.

1005
00:59:56.593 --> 00:59:57.942
That's how it is?

1006
00:59:59.987 --> 01:00:01.815
Yeah. that's how it is.

1007
01:00:11.912 --> 01:00:13.392
Ben.

1008
01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:26.535
We have to go back and...
sort it out.

1009
01:00:28.712 --> 01:00:31.497
But... when we're there...

1010
01:00:33.499 --> 01:00:35.501
we can keep talking.

1011
01:00:36.676 --> 01:00:39.636
Ben. for me. please.
Let's just go back together.

1012
01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:09.421
Oh.

1013
01:02:17.821 --> 01:02:19.561
You should be with your parents.

1014
01:02:20.171 --> 01:02:23.174

1015
01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:28.788

Sure.

1017
01:02:36.404 --> 01:02:40.626
Oh. Lucy. I think we should stay
by the cabin with your parents.

1018
01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:44.412
I'll get them soon.

1019
01:02:45.065 --> 01:02:46.110
What?

1020
01:02:47.285 --> 01:02:48.939
I want to play with you now.

1021
01:02:52.377 --> 01:02:53.421
Honey...

1022
01:02:53.552 --> 01:02:55.423
I want to show you
what's in the woods.

1023
01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:00.515
Lucy.

01:03:03.649 --> 01:03:06.347
I want to show you
what's in the woods.

1025
01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:14.094
Please?

1026

Oh. honey.

Hey.

1031

Lucy. come here right now.

1033
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:59.792
But...She just wanted to...

1034
01:03:59.879 --> 01:04:01.707
Don't tell me what she wants.

1035
01:04:04.492 --> 01:04:05.798
I'm gonna go check
on your mother.

1036

Are you okay?

1039
01:04:21.727 --> 01:04:23.424
Can I show you something
in the woods?

1040
01:04:56.675 --> 01:04:57.806
Ellie?

1041
01:05:07.033 --> 01:05:08.165
Ellie?

1042
01:05:21.352 --> 01:05:22.744
Ellie?

1043
01:05:38.282 --> 01:05:39.370
Ellie?

1044
01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.160

Fuck.

1051
01:07:09.764 --> 01:07:13.942
Oh. come on. Ben.
Pick up. Ben.

1052
01:08:24.317 --> 01:08:25.449
Ellie?

1053
01:08:33.587 --> 01:08:34.588
What the fuck?

1054
01:08:50.517 --> 01:08:53.564
Oh. m... Oh. my God!

1055
01:08:53.651 --> 01:08:56.175
Ellie! Ellie!

1056
01:08:56.306 --> 01:08:59.918
Ellie! Ellie. what...

1057
01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:03.139
Oh. my God. what happened?

1058
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:06.359
What happened?

1059
01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:14.759
Oh. my God.

1060
01:09:32.342 --> 01:09:34.344
Spencer?

1061
01:09:48.096 --> 01:09:50.055
What did you do to your mom.
Spencer?

1062
01:11:38.206 --> 01:11:42.776
Want to play a game. Margaret?
It's fun. I promise.

1063
01:11:44.256 --> 01:11:45.910
You play the Rabid Queen.

1064
01:11:46.084 --> 01:11:48.086
And I'll even give you
a head start.

1065
01:11:50.088 --> 01:11:53.831
You want to know what happens
when we catch the Rabid Queen?

1066
01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.486
I never got to tell you.

1067
01:12:15.069 --> 01:12:16.462
Ten.

1068
01:12:18.595 --> 01:12:19.813
Nine.

1069
01:12:22.773 --> 01:12:24.775
Eight.

1070
01:12:26.646 --> 01:12:28.735
Seven.

1071
01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:33.044
Six.

1072
01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:36.613
Five.

1073
01:12:39.006 --> 01:12:40.268
Four.

1074
01:12:42.749 --> 01:12:44.011
Three.

1075
01:12:46.536 --> 01:12:48.146
Two.

1076
01:12:51.279 --> 01:12:52.629
One.

1077
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:59.287
Ready or not.
here we come.

1078
01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:54.255
Off with her head.

1079
01:14:01.393 --> 01:14:03.351
She's dead. They killed her.PARK RANGER: Whoa. whoa.

1080
01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:05.223
Slow down. Slow down.
Are you Ms. Huerta?

1081
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:07.225
No. She's dead. They killed her.

1082
01:14:07.312 --> 01:14:08.618
You're not listening to me.Okay. I received

1083
01:14:08.705 --> 01:14:09.923
a call about a dead boy.

1084
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:11.577
It's Ms. Huerta who's dead?

1085
01:14:11.664 --> 01:14:14.319
No. he's not dead.
He came back and he killed her.

1086
01:14:14.406 --> 01:14:16.800
Listen. I need you
to take a deep breath. okay?

1087
01:14:16.887 --> 01:14:17.888
Just breathe.

1088
01:14:18.018 --> 01:14:20.151
It's them.
It's the fucking children.

1089
01:14:20.238 --> 01:14:22.327
We... we need to get
into your truck right now.

1090
01:14:22.414 --> 01:14:24.416
All... all right. ma'am.
Why don't we go inside

1091
01:14:24.503 --> 01:14:26.505
and you can just show me
what happened. okay?

1092
01:14:26.592 --> 01:14:28.159
Everything's gonna be all right.
We'll work this out.

1093
01:14:28.246 --> 01:14:29.769
I don't want to go in there.
She's in there.

1094
01:14:29.856 --> 01:14:32.163
Ms. Huerta?No. it's... it's her kids.

1095
01:14:32.293 --> 01:14:33.991
She's dead in the bedroom.

1096
01:14:34.078 --> 01:14:35.253
Okay. okay.And now her...

1097
01:14:35.427 --> 01:14:38.474
Actually. why don't you stay
out here instead. okay?

1098
01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:40.563
I'll just go in
and check things out.

1099
01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:42.129
see what's what and...

1100
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:44.784
Stay right there. Do not move.

1101
01:14:46.351 --> 01:14:48.396
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

1102
01:15:07.459 --> 01:15:08.634
Fuck this.

1103
01:15:10.854 --> 01:15:13.552
All right. Stop right there.
ma'am. Stop. Okay?

1104
01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.424
There's a lot of blood in there.
You're right about that.

1105
01:15:16.555 --> 01:15:18.165
But there's no dead boy

1106
01:15:18.252 --> 01:15:20.167
and there's no dead lady
in there either.

1107
01:15:21.342 --> 01:15:23.649
That's not possible. I...

1108
01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:26.173
Listen. I'm gonna need you
to come down with me to... to...

1109
01:16:19.313 --> 01:16:24.101
Margaret.
Where are you?

1110
01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:27.670
Come out. come out.
wherever you are.

1111
01:17:10.408 --> 01:17:13.367
Olly olly oxen free.

1112
01:18:34.535 --> 01:18:35.711
Ben?

1113
01:18:37.321 --> 01:18:38.539
Ben?

1114
01:18:45.285 --> 01:18:46.634
Ben?

1115
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:49.246
Ben. where are you?

1116
01:18:52.858 --> 01:18:54.251
Margaret.

1117
01:18:54.468 --> 01:18:58.559
Oh. my God.
Okay.

1118
01:18:58.690 --> 01:18:59.735
Okay. we need to go.

1119
01:18:59.865 --> 01:19:00.997
What?We need to go.

1120
01:19:01.084 --> 01:19:02.563
I'm so sorry
that I didn't listen to you.

1121
01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:04.478
but everything you said was true
so we have to go now.

1122
01:19:04.565 --> 01:19:05.741
No. no. no.
Why would we do that?

1123
01:19:05.871 --> 01:19:07.699
Because they're trying
to kill us.

1124
01:19:07.786 --> 01:19:09.353
No. it's beautiful.

1125
01:19:09.962 --> 01:19:11.268
I didn't understand
why the kids were

1126
01:19:11.398 --> 01:19:14.967
so drawn to it before.
but now... now I do.

1127
01:19:15.054 --> 01:19:16.316
I know why
they followed it down.

1128
01:19:16.403 --> 01:19:17.796
Hey. I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

1129
01:19:17.883 --> 01:19:19.667
but we need to. we need to.
we need to go now.

1130
01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:21.408
The place that shines.

1131
01:19:23.454 --> 01:19:25.195
And you can see it. too.

1132
01:19:25.935 --> 01:19:28.807
I don't...
I don't want to see it.

1133
01:19:28.981 --> 01:19:31.767
I want to... I want to go. Ben.

1134
01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:33.464
There's nowhere else to go.

1135
01:19:36.815 --> 01:19:38.774
I think we should settle down.

1136
01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.435
We should start a family.

1137
01:19:53.919 --> 01:19:59.185
You decided for us before.
but now... I'm weighing in.

1138
01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:02.319
Those fucking things
are trying to fucking kill us!

1139
01:20:02.928 --> 01:20:04.843
We don't even know
where Thomas is.

1140
01:20:05.626 --> 01:20:08.064
Those things. they killed Ellie.

1141
01:20:08.194 --> 01:20:10.675
They're young. They'll learn.

1142
01:20:11.719 --> 01:20:14.461
And we can be together.
All of us.

1143
01:20:14.722 --> 01:20:17.377
That feeling of connection
you've been searching for.

1144
01:20:17.943 --> 01:20:20.293
It's being part
of something bigger.

1145
01:20:22.078 --> 01:20:25.733
I've found that. I can show you.

1146
01:20:30.608 --> 01:20:32.523
I don't know what you are.
but you're not Ben.

1147
01:20:38.921 --> 01:20:40.226
You'll see.

1148
01:20:41.358 --> 01:20:42.750
And you'll make more of them.

1149
01:20:44.317 --> 01:20:47.973
We'll make more.
We'll make them together.

1150
01:26:49.465 --> 01:26:50.553
Margaret.

1151
01:26:52.424 --> 01:26:54.209
No.

1152
01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:58.082
No.

1153
01:27:04.044 --> 01:27:08.484
Just... just let me go.
Let me go.

1154
01:27:12.923 --> 01:27:14.011
Go!

1155
01:27:15.708 --> 01:27:16.970
Go!

1156
01:27:28.373 --> 01:27:30.245
Margaret!

1158
01:31:28.874 --> 01:31:30.354
