70
00:04:32.107 --> 00:04:34.176
Uh. we can talk here

71
00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:37.412
or. uh. our office is
about five minutes away.

72
00:04:37.412 --> 00:04:39.380
uh. if you want to.
if you'd rather talk there.

73

either one.

00:04:41.183 --> 00:04:42.721
It makes no difference
to me.

- Taylor: Do you have any pets?

- 'Cause you-you've
been gone a while.

use the bathroom.
stuff like that?

I. uh. I-I do.

80
00:04:56.264 --> 00:04:58.333
Um. would you mind

81
00:04:58.333 --> 00:05:00.302
if I at least get some
perishables into the fridge?

82
00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:01.436
Taylor:
And we can do that. too.

83
00:05:01.436 --> 00:05:03.072
But what we're gonna
have to do is. uh...

84
00:05:03.072 --> 00:05:04.609
(brakes squeal)

85
00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:06.811

Yes.

87
00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:10.645
Taylor:
Okay. What we're
gonna have to do is

88
00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:12.514
we're gonna have to go
into the house first.

89
00:05:12.514 --> 00:05:14.653
make sure it's.
it's safe.

90
00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:18.020
We have a search warrant.
so we-we're. uh.

91
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.691
we're going to.

92
00:05:21.392 --> 00:05:22.391
- Absolutely.
- Taylor: Okay.

93
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:23.826
And what we'll do is

94
00:05:23.826 --> 00:05:25.427
we'll keep you out here
until we do that

95
00:05:25.427 --> 00:05:27.495
and once we secure it.
we'll. uh...

96
00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:29.064
then we can kind of
go from there. okay?

97
00:05:29.064 --> 00:05:30.435
Of course.

98
00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:34.673
(dog barking)

99
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.509
So is your dog friendly?

100
00:05:39.677 --> 00:05:41.947
(chuckles)
Okay. well. uh. so...

101
00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:45.881
she doesn't... like men.

102
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:47.617
- Okay.
- So... (laughs)

103
00:05:47.617 --> 00:05:49.684
- So that's a problem.
- Yeah.

104
00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:52.420
- Um. she may come
towards you. but...
- Okay.

105
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.723
She's never bitten anybody.
She's not aggressive.

106
00:05:54.723 --> 00:05:56.758
She's just got. you know.
a really good growl going.

107
00:05:56.758 --> 00:05:58.994
- Okay.
- She'll probably
hide under my desk.

108
00:05:58.994 --> 00:06:00.929
Do you have a.
a leash or--

109
00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:02.058
- I have a leash.
- Okay.

110
00:06:02.058 --> 00:06:03.668
I can. I can get her
leashed up.

111
00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:07.269
So what we might
want to do is maybe let you
go in there with her.

112
00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:08.503
You're not to touch
anything else.

113
00:06:08.503 --> 00:06:10.539
You're not to do
anything else
but get the dog

114
00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:11.739
and bring it out here.

115
00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:13.842
- We cool? We...
- Of course. I understand.

116
00:06:13.842 --> 00:06:16.078
Because otherwise.
if. if we have a problem.

117
00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:17.246
we're not gonna do that.

118
00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:18.980
I can move her
straight to the backyard.

119
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.215
- Taylor: Okay.
- Okay.

120
00:06:20.215 --> 00:06:21.686
Taylor:
Uh. house key?

121
00:06:25.122 --> 00:06:26.158
House key.

122
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.458
We also have a warrant
to search the car too.

123
00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:29.794
Do you have a cell phone?

124
00:06:38.034 --> 00:06:41.640
We'll take that. and we'll. uh.
kind of go from there. okay?

125
00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:44.406
Uh. but like he said.
we're completely voluntary.

126
00:06:44.406 --> 00:06:45.773
completely up to you on...

127
00:06:45.773 --> 00:06:48.009
But. you know. I think maybe
it'd be worth your time...

128
00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:49.778
- No. definitely.
- ...to listen. at least
for a little bit.

129
00:06:49.778 --> 00:06:51.280
- Um. definitely here...
- Okay?

130
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.381
And we can
kind of figure out

131
00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:53.515
what's. what's going on.

132
00:06:53.515 --> 00:06:55.885
- ...to. uh. comply.
- Okay.

133
00:06:55.885 --> 00:06:58.486
Her leash is two feet
inside the door

134
00:06:58.486 --> 00:06:59.621
where I left it
this morning.

135
00:06:59.621 --> 00:07:01.556
I can move her
straight to the backyard.

136
00:07:01.556 --> 00:07:03.595
Are there
any weapons in the car?
In the house?

137
00:07:05.596 --> 00:07:08.167
- In the house. yes.
- What do you have?

138
00:07:11.102 --> 00:07:12.905
I have an AR-15.

139
00:07:15.974 --> 00:07:17.042
Is it pink?

140
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:21.310
- It's pink.
- Okay.

141
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.182
(chuckles)
How'd you know?

142
00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:29.351
Uh. I have a Glock Nine
under the bed

143
00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:33.656
- and a. uh. a 15-gauge.
- Taylor: Okay.

144
00:07:33.656 --> 00:07:35.491
You sound like my house.

145
00:07:35.491 --> 00:07:37.529
Okay. we're good. then.

146
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:39.427
Garrick: Alright.
Just don't make any.

147
00:07:39.427 --> 00:07:41.766
any movements for those
and then we're...

148
00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:44.600
- Yeah.
- Taylor: Yeah.

149
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.971
I mean. we're all cool.

150
00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:48.173
- Yeah.
- Garrick: Yeah.

151
00:07:49.373 --> 00:07:51.143
I mean. kind of obvious.

152
00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:53.008
- Yeah.
- Taylor: You can put. put...

153
00:07:53.008 --> 00:07:55.714
There's a little
fenced-in area
where you can put her?

154
00:07:56.648 --> 00:07:58.447
Uh. yes. yes.

155
00:07:58.447 --> 00:07:59.881
And you won't even
take your eyes off me.

156
00:07:59.881 --> 00:08:01.751
Taylor:
And we'll get water
and stuff like that.

157
00:08:01.751 --> 00:08:04.386
And this other guy. uh.
is with us as well.

158
00:08:04.386 --> 00:08:05.721
And we'll probably have
a few more people

159

169
00:08:31.447 --> 00:08:33.349

170
00:08:33.349 --> 00:08:34.517
Hey. Mickey.

171
00:08:34.517 --> 00:08:35.584
Hey there.

172
00:08:35.584 --> 00:08:36.922
(dog barks)

173
00:08:39.957 --> 00:08:41.961
She doesn't know
what's going on. though.

174
00:08:45.196 --> 00:08:47.930
{\an8}(dog barking)

175
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.798
{\an8}(gate clanking)

176
00:08:49.798 --> 00:08:51.301
{\an8}Reality:
<i>There you go.</i>

177
00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:53.205
{\an8}(dog panting)

178
00:08:59.943 --> 00:09:02.714
You don't have any weapons
or anything on you. do you?

179
00:09:03.247 --> 00:09:05.114
- No.
- None in the car?

180
00:09:05.114 --> 00:09:07.010
Um. in the car? No.

181
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.054
- (door rattling)
- Hey.

182
00:09:10.354 --> 00:09:11.987
Hang on.
Hang on. hang on just--

183
00:09:11.987 --> 00:09:13.825
Can I close the door
for my cat?

184
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.162
Alright.

185
00:09:21.999 --> 00:09:24.069
'Cause that-that's all
I care about right now.

186
00:09:27.938 --> 00:09:31.507
Okay. uh. so the only thing
in there now that's alive

187
00:09:31.507 --> 00:09:32.611
is the cat?

188
00:09:33.044 --> 00:09:35.575
- Reality: Yes.
- There's not a person?

189
00:09:36.581 --> 00:09:37.849
No person.

190
00:09:39.216 --> 00:09:40.281
They're on their way?

191
00:09:40.281 --> 00:09:41.581
Yeah. they're pulling up.

192
00:09:56.701 --> 00:10:00.305
(car doors closing)

193
00:10:03.474 --> 00:10:04.977
Taylor:
Why don't we. uh...

194
00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:08.043
Do you want to wait out here
with her for a minute?

195
00:10:08.043 --> 00:10:09.281
And Joe and I
will walk through.

196
00:10:10.714 --> 00:10:12.348
Again. just to explain.
we have a search warrant.

197
00:10:12.348 --> 00:10:13.748
It's...

198
00:10:13.748 --> 00:10:15.720
- I-I understand.
- Taylor: It's en route. So...

199
00:10:28.199 --> 00:10:31.667
(inaudible chatter)

200
00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:34.739
(tense music playing)

201
00:10:56.861 --> 00:10:59.362
(objects clattering)

202
00:10:59.362 --> 00:11:00.895
It's alright.

203
00:11:00.895 --> 00:11:02.665
They're just making sure. uh.
just checking to make sure

204
00:11:02.665 --> 00:11:04.432
there's nobody else
in there

205
00:11:04.432 --> 00:11:06.468
or nothing... surprise!
(chuckles)

206
00:11:06.468 --> 00:11:08.371
Surprise us
or anything like that.

207
00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:10.172
- Yup.
- So...

208
00:11:10.172 --> 00:11:11.606
I'm gonna make this

209
00:11:11.606 --> 00:11:13.743
as easy as possible
for you guys.

210
00:11:13.743 --> 00:11:15.811
Okay. Likewise.

211
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:17.713
So hopefully
explain things.

212
00:11:17.713 --> 00:11:20.382
get to. uh.
figure this all out

213
00:11:20.382 --> 00:11:22.285
and. uh. wrap it up.

214
00:11:22.285 --> 00:11:23.788
(dog barking)

215
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.125
How. uh.
(clears throat)

216
00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:31.263
how. how old is she?

217
00:11:33.765 --> 00:11:35.798
We don't know.
She's one of those.

218
00:11:35.798 --> 00:11:37.666
Oh yeah. Yeah.
My. uh.

219
00:11:37.666 --> 00:11:39.271
(clears throat)
one of my dogs is a rescue.

220
00:11:39.838 --> 00:11:42.574
And when I got him.
he wouldn't. uh...

221
00:11:43.207 --> 00:11:45.374
I was the only guy
who could touch him.

222
00:11:45.374 --> 00:11:46.375
Huh?

223
00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:47.943
Anybody else came
in the house.

224
00:11:47.943 --> 00:11:51.881
especially male.
he'd pee all over the place.

225
00:11:51.881 --> 00:11:53.449
But I could touch him.
and it was fine.

226
00:11:53.449 --> 00:11:54.453
(Reality chuckles)

227
00:11:56.253 --> 00:11:59.688
So whoever had him
before was a real. uh.

228
00:11:59.688 --> 00:12:01.860
phew. real piece of work.

229
00:12:02.293 --> 00:12:06.031
Yeah. She was left in a kennel
and neglected her whole life.

230
00:12:08.766 --> 00:12:10.465
Taylor:
Why don't we. uh...

231
00:12:10.465 --> 00:12:12.802
Let's get the groceries.
throw 'em in the fridge
real quick.

232
00:12:12.802 --> 00:12:14.506
then we'll bring you
back out here. okay?

233
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.047
(clattering)

234
00:12:28.886 --> 00:12:32.291
(indistinct chatter)

235
00:12:51.008 --> 00:12:56.015
{\an8}(objects thudding)

236
00:12:59.818 --> 00:13:01.617
{\an8}(paper crinkling)

237
00:13:01.617 --> 00:13:02.951
{\an8}Joe:
<i>Is that...</i>

238
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:05.057
{\an8}Garrick: <i>Uh. no. that's it
for the perishables.</i>

239
00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:08.493
Should be.

240
00:13:09.861 --> 00:13:11.263
(car door closes)

241
00:13:15.133 --> 00:13:17.502
(clears throat)
The neighbors.

242
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.209
(Taylor clears throat)

243
00:13:27.209 --> 00:13:29.745
Alright. If you could
just. uh. step over.

244
00:13:29.745 --> 00:13:30.782
Just here.

245
00:13:31.282 --> 00:13:33.185
Yeah.
Just stop right there.

246
00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:38.290
Look up here.

247
00:13:41.386 --> 00:13:42.461
(camera shutter clicks)

248
00:13:46.531 --> 00:13:47.566
Joe:
Just...

249
00:14:00.912 --> 00:14:03.311
There's a cat in the house.
in the bed.

250
00:14:03.311 --> 00:14:04.947
- or it's on the bed.
- On the bed?

251
00:14:04.947 --> 00:14:07.115
- Or was on the bed.
- It's...

252
00:14:07.115 --> 00:14:09.451
It-it'll probably go
under the bed at some point.

253
00:14:09.451 --> 00:14:12.324
Garrick: The dog is in
the backyard in the fence.

254
00:14:14.593 --> 00:14:15.627
Does...

255
00:14:18.563 --> 00:14:20.190
does she need water?

256
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.363
She'll be fine.

257
00:14:21.363 --> 00:14:23.568
She's been inside all day
with her water.

258
00:14:24.736 --> 00:14:25.865
Garrick:
Okay.

259
00:14:26.804 --> 00:14:28.974
- (door closes)
- Alrighty.

260
00:14:30.709 --> 00:14:31.674
Alright.

261
00:14:31.674 --> 00:14:33.442
So would you like
to talk here

262
00:14:33.442 --> 00:14:35.378
or talk. uh.

263
00:14:35.378 --> 00:14:36.448
talk at the office?

264
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:39.047
Uh. we can go ahead
and talk here.

265
00:14:39.047 --> 00:14:40.716
Do you want
to talk here?

266
00:14:40.716 --> 00:14:42.585
- Sure.
- Okay.

267
00:14:42.585 --> 00:14:44.356
Uh. let's. uh...

268
00:14:45.756 --> 00:14:47.717
I'm trying to think
if we have any

269
00:14:47.717 --> 00:14:50.225
private place. uh.
there in the house that--

270
00:14:50.225 --> 00:14:51.661
D-do you have anything
there in the house

271
00:14:51.661 --> 00:14:53.933
that we can kind of sit
that's away...

272
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:57.602
Away?

273
00:15:04.408 --> 00:15:06.809
There's one bedroom
that's empty.

274
00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:09.111
I don't...

275
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:12.351
I-I don't. I don't really like
to go in there...

276
00:15:13.951 --> 00:15:15.487
other than...

277
00:15:16.354 --> 00:15:19.855
I guess I don't really have
anything else other than that.

278
00:15:19.855 --> 00:15:21.524
that back room.

279
00:15:21.524 --> 00:15:22.594
That back room?

280
00:15:25.196 --> 00:15:28.130
Okay. And it's. uh.
it's completely empty?

281
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.398
Yeah. You'll go in there.

282
00:15:29.398 --> 00:15:30.599
There's. uh.

283
00:15:30.599 --> 00:15:32.471
there's one
dog kennel cage.

284
00:15:33.104 --> 00:15:34.870
Other than that.
I don't use it.

285
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.933
Garrick:
Okay. Alright. Um.

286
00:15:36.933 --> 00:15:40.075
y-y-you said you don't like
to go in there. But. uh...

287
00:15:40.075 --> 00:15:42.678
Oh. gosh.
No. it's just... weird.

288
00:15:42.678 --> 00:15:43.912
It's just creepy.

289
00:15:43.912 --> 00:15:45.150
It's like an addition to the.

290
00:15:45.649 --> 00:15:47.115
the back of the house
behind the kitchen.

291
00:15:47.115 --> 00:15:49.418
and it's always dirty.

292
00:15:49.418 --> 00:15:50.481
Okay. Alright.

293
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:51.920
We. we can talk
back there

294
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.458
if. if you're fine
going back there.

295
00:15:54.424 --> 00:15:56.758
- It's. uh... (clears throat)
- Yeah. we can go back there.

296
00:15:56.758 --> 00:16:00.562
Okay. Alright.
There's a. uh.
there's a back room there

297
00:16:00.562 --> 00:16:02.064
- that we can...
- Taylor: Kind of
like the laundry?

298
00:16:02.064 --> 00:16:03.065
Garrick:
...that she'd like to talk in.

299
00:16:03.065 --> 00:16:04.700
Taylor:
Yeah. that'll work.

300
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.134
It's too hot
out here for...

301
00:16:06.134 --> 00:16:07.302
Oh. well.
I can make a pitstop

302
00:16:07.302 --> 00:16:10.109
and take out the AC
if you need that.

303
00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:12.908
Well. there's.
they've gotta do their thing

304
00:16:12.908 --> 00:16:14.009
for a minute.
and then we can go in.

305
00:16:14.009 --> 00:16:14.977
We can go in.

306
00:16:14.977 --> 00:16:16.378
Oh. get the password.

307
00:16:16.378 --> 00:16:18.179
Oh. what's the. uh.
how do you open this?

308
00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:19.618
- Uh--
- Just hang on.

309
00:16:21.052 --> 00:16:23.155
Joe:
What kind is it?
An iPhone?

310
00:16:48.112 --> 00:16:49.381
(Garrick clears throat)

311
00:16:50.849 --> 00:16:52.184
How long you lived
in Augusta?

312
00:16:53.985 --> 00:16:56.685
Uh... I was out here

313
00:16:56.685 --> 00:17:00.792
October 2015
to April 2016.

314
00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:04.596
um. TDY. and then moved back
this past December.

315
00:17:04.828 --> 00:17:06.631
Garrick:
What do-- (chuckles)
what do you think of it?

316
00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:09.965
Well. I willingly moved
back here as a civilian.

317
00:17:09.965 --> 00:17:11.166
so I guess
it must be alright.

318
00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:12.300
Willingly.
(chuckles)

319
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.772
You say that.
you say that begrudgingly.

320
00:17:14.305 --> 00:17:16.942
Yeah. I. I mean.
originally. I--

321
00:17:17.275 --> 00:17:20.109
My big plan is to deploy
as a Pashto linguist

322
00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:21.409
and be in Bagram
for a bit.

323
00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:24.146
But then they hired me
out here for Farsi. so...

324
00:17:24.146 --> 00:17:26.015
Wait. you're-you're
Farsi and Pashto?

325
00:17:26.015 --> 00:17:28.083
Farsi. Dari. Pashto.

326
00:17:28.083 --> 00:17:29.752
Wow! That's...

327
00:17:29.752 --> 00:17:31.623
(laughs)
that's impressive.

328
00:17:32.256 --> 00:17:35.055
I can barely. I-I'm barely
able to speak English.

329
00:17:36.661 --> 00:17:37.696
English is hard.

330
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.060
Hmm.

331
00:17:41.365 --> 00:17:43.494
Uh. but yeah.
I noticed that with--

332
00:17:43.494 --> 00:17:46.405
(coughing. sniffling)

333
00:17:47.204 --> 00:17:48.871
Especially here at Augusta.

334
00:17:48.871 --> 00:17:50.338
it's. uh.
it's great for families.

335
00:17:50.338 --> 00:17:53.441
But. uh. single. it's.
it's kind of tough.

336
00:17:53.441 --> 00:17:57.212
Like. I can't imagine
coming back.

337
00:17:57.212 --> 00:17:58.817
Taylor:
What's the. um...

338
00:17:59.183 --> 00:18:01.649
Do you. uh. do you have
a password or anything?

339
00:18:01.649 --> 00:18:04.086
- No password.
- How do we. how do we do it?

340
00:18:04.086 --> 00:18:05.588
Show me how to do it
or tell me how to do it.

341
00:18:05.588 --> 00:18:06.722
Swipe that?

342
00:18:06.722 --> 00:18:08.257
Uh. yeah.

343
00:18:08.257 --> 00:18:09.528
Taylor:
No security?

344
00:18:10.028 --> 00:18:11.296
No security.

345
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.462
You don't have a password
or anything that--

346
00:18:14.462 --> 00:18:16.764
No password. Nothing.
Just anytime it locks.

347
00:18:16.764 --> 00:18:19.601
- you just press
the side there...
- Okay.

348
00:18:19.601 --> 00:18:22.141
...until you see the circle
and just slide up a bit.

349
00:18:23.107 --> 00:18:24.409
Okay. so it...

350
00:18:25.442 --> 00:18:27.342
(Taylor quietly muttering)

351
00:18:27.342 --> 00:18:28.813
Did you already show her
the warrant?

352
00:18:30.314 --> 00:18:31.650
Garrick:
Uh. no. I haven't.

353
00:18:34.151 --> 00:18:37.156
I was going to. We're going to.
we're going to sit down
and show it to her.

354
00:18:38.689 --> 00:18:42.161
(rustling)

355
00:18:51.269 --> 00:18:53.238
Garrick: What made you
get out of the Air Force?

356
00:18:56.741 --> 00:18:59.278
I. I wanted to deploy.

357
00:19:00.178 --> 00:19:02.611
I mean. I learned Pashto
for a reason

358
00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:04.947
and those opportunities aren't
in the Air Force right now.

359
00:19:04.947 --> 00:19:06.181
Mm.
(chuckles)

360
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:07.482
You figure that
with that language.

361
00:19:07.482 --> 00:19:09.351
you could just
raise your hand and they'd go.

362
00:19:09.351 --> 00:19:11.123
- Right here!
- "Yeah. go."

363
00:19:11.622 --> 00:19:13.488
Yeah. No.
Where I was in Maryland.

364
00:19:13.488 --> 00:19:15.524
they only had one billet
per year for Afghanistan.

365
00:19:15.524 --> 00:19:17.659
and it was all
always airborne.

366
00:19:17.659 --> 00:19:19.064
Not even language.

367
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.333
So I imagine people
are just crawling for it.

368
00:19:21.865 --> 00:19:24.667
Yeah. And I don't have
my airborne physical. So...

369
00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:26.669
(dog barking)

370
00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:28.103
Joe:
Is your dog okay?

371
00:19:28.103 --> 00:19:29.942
- Does it need anything?
- She's fine.

372
00:19:30.407 --> 00:19:32.440
- She?
- Yeah. she's--

373
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.610
If you can tell
we're all dog people.

374
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.215
(laughs)

375
00:19:37.047 --> 00:19:38.650
Yeah. I can.
I can tell.

376
00:19:44.488 --> 00:19:45.688
Is she destructive at all

377
00:19:45.688 --> 00:19:47.589
when she. when you
leave her alone?

378
00:19:47.589 --> 00:19:50.190
Yeah. she's just
a nervous chewer.

379
00:19:53.197 --> 00:19:54.163
Man:
Whoa!

380
00:19:54.163 --> 00:19:56.501
(man laughing)

381
00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.576
(keyboard clacking)

382
00:20:11.482 --> 00:20:12.784
Where do you CrossFit at?

383
00:20:15.387 --> 00:20:18.890
Uh. I'm at SEC.

384
00:20:19.523 --> 00:20:23.125
It used to be
on. uh. Enterprise Court...

385
00:20:23.125 --> 00:20:24.392
- Mm-hmm.
- ...off of Bobby Jones.

386
00:20:24.392 --> 00:20:26.365
and then we moved
to Wheeler.

387
00:20:28.632 --> 00:20:31.533
Uh. but my-my friend's
reopening the Under Box.

388
00:20:31.533 --> 00:20:34.269
Garrick:
You. you going to go off?

389
00:20:34.269 --> 00:20:36.005
Yeah. I'm just. I'm just
waiting for her gym

390
00:20:36.005 --> 00:20:37.639
to open to. to jump ship.

391
00:20:37.639 --> 00:20:39.775
- (Taylor talking indistinctly)
- (Joe laughing)

392
00:20:39.775 --> 00:20:41.310
Garrick: I did it
for. like. six months.

393
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.610
and I hurt myself.

394
00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.514
- Oh.
- Just every single day
was just pain.

395
00:20:45.514 --> 00:20:47.215
- Yeah.
- So. I don't know.

396
00:20:47.215 --> 00:20:49.321
I guess I'm just too old
and broken.

397
00:20:53.691 --> 00:20:56.224
Yeah. I always say that
I. I don't do CrossFit.

398
00:20:56.224 --> 00:20:57.592
- I do competitive powerlifting.
- Garrick: Okay.

399
00:20:57.592 --> 00:20:59.495
And then I do CrossFit
when it's convenient.

400
00:20:59.495 --> 00:21:00.865
Garrick:
No. Uh-huh.

401
00:21:01.532 --> 00:21:03.966
Taylor:
What's your. uh...
(chuckles)

402
00:21:03.966 --> 00:21:05.370
Powerlifting?

403
00:21:07.137 --> 00:21:09.171
What's your.
y-your preference on?

404
00:21:09.171 --> 00:21:11.073
What's your favorite stuff?

405
00:21:11.073 --> 00:21:14.479
Oh. I'm just
all upper body.

406
00:21:15.012 --> 00:21:16.511
So. bench.

407
00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:18.479
It's kind of sad.
I tested my lifts this week

408
00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:20.382
because I have a competition
on June 24th.

409
00:21:20.382 --> 00:21:24.385
and my max bench is 180.
and then my max back squat--

410
00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:26.221
I have a.
I have a back injury.

411
00:21:26.221 --> 00:21:28.458
so my max back squat is 195.

412
00:21:28.458 --> 00:21:30.326
- But I don't--
- Still!

413
00:21:30.326 --> 00:21:31.760
Still not shabby.

414
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.929
No. it should not be
that close.

415
00:21:33.929 --> 00:21:35.567
How'd you hurt
your back?

416
00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:39.668
Uh. doing power cleans.

417
00:21:39.668 --> 00:21:42.438
My. uh. pelvis
wasn't rotating.

418
00:21:42.438 --> 00:21:45.007
so I separated that joint.

419
00:21:45.007 --> 00:21:46.645
- Sounds painful.
- Reality: Yeah.

420
00:21:47.344 --> 00:21:49.177
I did. um.
I was doing box jumps

421
00:21:49.177 --> 00:21:50.545
and this hand just...

422
00:21:50.545 --> 00:21:53.448
I was doing it by myself.
It hit the box.

423
00:21:53.448 --> 00:21:57.119
And. I-I mean. I thought
I just fractured every bone

424
00:21:57.119 --> 00:22:00.292
in the body.
in the. in the hand.

425
00:22:00.857 --> 00:22:03.491
And I went to. I had to go
to the doctor to get the x-ray.

426
00:22:03.491 --> 00:22:06.194
They said.
"So how did you do this?"
CrossFit.

427
00:22:06.194 --> 00:22:08.030
Four times they asked me.

428
00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.666
I said. "No. I didn't get
in a fight. It was CrossFit."

429
00:22:10.666 --> 00:22:12.004
(chuckles)

430
00:22:13.471 --> 00:22:14.804
I. I. um.
I thought I could see

431
00:22:14.804 --> 00:22:16.900
the bone on my shin
from that one.

432
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.473
Garrick:
Wow. What was that?

433
00:22:18.473 --> 00:22:20.909
Box jumps.
Just missed the box.

434
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:23.244
That's a moment
you really hope.
did anybody see that?

435
00:22:23.244 --> 00:22:25.450
(winces) I really hope
nobody saw that.

436
00:22:42.433 --> 00:22:44.970
So I do have
to ask just

437
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.838
however this goes.
and I don't want to make
any assumptions.

438
00:22:48.838 --> 00:22:52.240
but this is going to be
a thing where. like.

439
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.708
I brought my phone
into the building

440
00:22:53.708 --> 00:22:56.015
and I don't see that phone
for three weeks or...

441
00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.947
- So. we'll go over the--
- So. we have a warrant
for the phone.

442
00:22:58.947 --> 00:23:00.248
Yeah. no. and I don't.
I don't want to make

443
00:23:00.248 --> 00:23:01.817
any assumptions
or anything like that.

444
00:23:01.817 --> 00:23:02.922
Just. uh...

445
00:23:03.587 --> 00:23:06.656
I'm. I'm teaching
yoga tomorrow.

446
00:23:06.656 --> 00:23:08.693
and my phone has
the music on it.

447
00:23:17.302 --> 00:23:18.703
Okay.

448
00:23:20.104 --> 00:23:23.238
I mean. there are...
bigger problems in the world.

449
00:23:23.238 --> 00:23:25.106
So I. I can make do.
I guess.

450
00:23:25.106 --> 00:23:29.181
Yeah. And. uh. we'll. we'll talk
about that once we sit down.

451
00:23:29.713 --> 00:23:32.447
Is there. uh. do you have
just a few chairs?

452
00:23:32.447 --> 00:23:35.017
Like. kitchen table chairs
we can pull into that.

453
00:23:35.017 --> 00:23:37.620
that back room
or are we gonna be
sitting on the floor?

454
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.524
Reality:
No. Uh...

455
00:23:40.124 --> 00:23:44.663
yeah. if you want to sit.
I'm not too big on furniture.

456
00:24:10.588 --> 00:24:11.721
(camera beeps)

457
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:15.090
(indistinct radio chatter)

458
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.761
(camera beeps. shutter clicks)

459
00:24:38.382 --> 00:24:40.248
Would it be too much
to ask if I can get

460
00:24:40.248 --> 00:24:42.083
the cat on a leash
and tied up?

461
00:24:42.083 --> 00:24:43.855
Just. um...

462
00:24:45.323 --> 00:24:48.190
I just don't want to be. like.
asking someone in the FBI

463
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.460
to keep the front door closed
if you guys are doing a search.

464
00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.528
I don't see.
I don't see an issue.

465
00:24:53.528 --> 00:24:56.799
Uh. uh. where is
the cat right now?

466
00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:58.300
- In the bedroom.
- Uh. on the bed.

467
00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.434
In the bed.

468
00:24:59.434 --> 00:25:02.304
- Okay.
- Still in the bed?

469
00:25:02.304 --> 00:25:03.271
Joe:
Yeah. I think so.

470
00:25:03.271 --> 00:25:04.676
(camera beeps. shutter clicks)

471
00:25:11.148 --> 00:25:13.615
Taylor: Where... um.
just safety's sake.

472
00:25:13.615 --> 00:25:15.951
where are the. uh...
there's your weapon
and the--

473
00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:17.920
The weapon. it's right by
the little table

474
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.891
with the lamp
right under the bed.

475
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.722
Your cat's under there.

476
00:25:21.722 --> 00:25:24.363
He's under the bed.
or she's under the bed.

477
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:26.762
Taylor: The AR is
in the case in here?

478
00:25:26.762 --> 00:25:27.563
Yes.

479
00:25:27.563 --> 00:25:28.897
Where's the other gun?

480
00:25:28.897 --> 00:25:30.532
Reality:
It's behind it.
more against the wall

481
00:25:30.532 --> 00:25:31.600
in the black case.

482
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.202
{\an8}Can you get your cat?

483
00:25:33.202 --> 00:25:34.937
- Do you want to get your cat?
- Joe: Can you...

484
00:25:34.937 --> 00:25:36.305
Taylor:
Do you want to get your cat?

485
00:25:36.305 --> 00:25:37.407
Joe: Do you want
to get your cat?

486
00:25:37.407 --> 00:25:38.710
Just-- Get your cat.

487
00:25:57.061 --> 00:25:58.130
(purrs softly)

488
00:26:07.237 --> 00:26:09.137
Reality (on recording):
<i>Alright. She's good.</i>

489
00:26:09.137 --> 00:26:11.543
{\an8}- Taylor: (sighs) <i>Okay.</i>
- Garrick: <i>Alright.</i>

490
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:13.941
{\an8}<i>Taylor:
Uh. you wanna go back here?</i>

491
00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:16.278
{\an8}Garrick:
<i>Yeah. you can go ahead
and go back in there.</i>

492
00:26:16.278 --> 00:26:17.983
{\an8}(clattering)

493
00:26:20.284 --> 00:26:21.320
(switch clicks)

494
00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:40.005
(door closes)

495
00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:44.209
(tense music playing)

496
00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:49.982
(blinds rattle)

497
00:26:57.088 --> 00:26:59.758
This room is dirty.
I'm so sorry.

498
00:27:05.229 --> 00:27:06.231
(blinds rattle)

499
00:27:13.438 --> 00:27:14.739
Alrighty.

500
00:27:16.708 --> 00:27:19.578
So. uh. again.
my name is Justin.

501
00:27:20.144 --> 00:27:22.077
You probably
don't re-remember
any idea of who I am.

502
00:27:22.077 --> 00:27:25.117
So. Justin Garrick
with the FBI.

503
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:27.953
Uh. this is Wally.
He's my partner.

504
00:27:28.552 --> 00:27:30.285
Um. so what I want to do
is kind of explain

505
00:27:30.285 --> 00:27:32.391
that. you know. we do have
a search warrant.

506
00:27:33.057 --> 00:27:34.456
Uh. you're welcome
to see the warrant.

507
00:27:34.456 --> 00:27:35.857
You're welcome
to read the warrant.

508
00:27:35.857 --> 00:27:37.525
And then explain
a little bit about it.

509
00:27:37.525 --> 00:27:40.499
Now. if you're willing
to talk to me.

510
00:27:40.999 --> 00:27:43.832
I'd like to kind of go through
just how this started

511
00:27:43.832 --> 00:27:46.234
and. you know.
give your. your side of it.

512
00:27:46.234 --> 00:27:48.136
We'll figure out
what's going on here.

513
00:27:48.136 --> 00:27:51.110
Does that sound. uh.
sound good to you?

514
00:27:53.378 --> 00:27:54.674
Okay.

515
00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.249
Okay?

516
00:27:59.517 --> 00:28:00.819
Yes.

517
00:28:02.353 --> 00:28:04.014
Now I'm
gonna take. uh...

518
00:28:04.014 --> 00:28:05.090
(clears throat)

519
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.591
Right here.

520
00:28:06.958 --> 00:28:09.294
I'm gonna take.
uh. notes.

521
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.660
uh. just random basis.

522
00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.694
You gotta take notes.

523
00:28:12.694 --> 00:28:14.497
(Reality chuckles)

524
00:28:14.497 --> 00:28:16.001
(Garrick clears throat)

525
00:28:17.501 --> 00:28:18.734
Now. do you need water
or anything?

526
00:28:18.734 --> 00:28:20.439
Ar-are you thirsty?

527
00:28:23.207 --> 00:28:25.177
You're what?
If you need water.
shout it out.

528
00:28:27.044 --> 00:28:30.249
Uh... okay.
I'll let you know. Thanks.

529
00:28:31.315 --> 00:28:32.548
Are you thirsty?

530
00:28:32.548 --> 00:28:33.986
Uh. not right now.

531
00:28:34.218 --> 00:28:35.715
Okay. Alright.

532
00:28:37.955 --> 00:28:39.421
Um. if you need
to use the restroom.

533
00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:40.490
any of that. let me know.

534
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.627
It's not a big deal. Okay?

535
00:28:43.327 --> 00:28:45.628
Okay. So currently.
you're employed

536
00:28:45.628 --> 00:28:48.364
as a contract. uh. linguist

537
00:28:48.364 --> 00:28:50.402
with Pluribus?

538
00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:52.000
Yes.

539
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.237
I'm sorry. what languages
you said?

540
00:28:54.237 --> 00:28:55.404
Um. I-I heard...

541
00:28:55.404 --> 00:28:57.376
Uh. Farsi. Dari. Pashto.

542
00:29:01.413 --> 00:29:02.678
Garrick:
Okay.

543
00:29:02.678 --> 00:29:04.116
(clears throat)
Any other?

544
00:29:07.151 --> 00:29:09.488
- No.
- Garrick: (laughing)
I'm kidding.

545
00:29:10.588 --> 00:29:11.890
I think that's enough.

546
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.722
(clears throat)
That's really impressive.

547
00:29:14.722 --> 00:29:17.396
Uh. and you live here.
uh. sorry. by yourself?

548
00:29:18.863 --> 00:29:21.196
- Yes.
- Garrick: Okay.

549
00:29:21.196 --> 00:29:22.864
(pen scratching)

550
00:29:22.864 --> 00:29:25.037
It's really hard
without a table and chairs.

551
00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:27.002
(clears throat)

552
00:29:27.002 --> 00:29:29.241
- I-I'm so sorry.
- It's...

553
00:29:29.841 --> 00:29:32.011
You don't have to apol--
It's your house.

554
00:29:33.077 --> 00:29:34.943
Um. if you do feel like.
you know.

555
00:29:34.943 --> 00:29:36.979
you want to sit
or anything. we'll sit.

556
00:29:36.979 --> 00:29:38.747
Okay? I mean.
if you sit on the floor.

557
00:29:38.747 --> 00:29:39.982
I'll sit on the floor.
I don't care.

558
00:29:39.982 --> 00:29:41.386
- Hmm?
- Reality: Mm-hmm.

559
00:29:42.687 --> 00:29:43.956
Okay.

560
00:29:45.089 --> 00:29:46.755
Um. and I'm serious
about that.

561
00:29:46.755 --> 00:29:47.756
If you want to sit. please.

562
00:29:47.756 --> 00:29:49.294
I'll. I'll sit down too.

563
00:29:51.363 --> 00:29:52.762
Okay.

564
00:29:52.762 --> 00:29:54.463
Um. so. again.

565
00:29:54.463 --> 00:29:56.326
We have a warrant.

566
00:29:56.326 --> 00:29:57.767
and it's...
do you...

567
00:29:57.767 --> 00:29:59.504
Would you like to see it?

568
00:30:00.605 --> 00:30:02.942
- Yes. please.
- Garrick: Okay.

569
00:30:05.309 --> 00:30:06.875
That just gave us
the authority to search

570
00:30:06.875 --> 00:30:08.914
the residence.
the car. and then you.

571
00:30:17.722 --> 00:30:20.559
125 pounds.
You guys flatter me.

572
00:30:23.622 --> 00:30:25.460
Sorry. I have
a sense of humor.

573
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.200
- That was on your
driver's license.
- Taylor: That's right.

574
00:30:29.901 --> 00:30:31.634
Okay. well. I lied.

575
00:30:31.634 --> 00:30:32.768
(both chuckle)

576
00:30:32.768 --> 00:30:34.239
Don't we all?

577
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.673
Attachment "B"
just explains the property

578
00:30:38.673 --> 00:30:40.776
- that we're authorized
to search for and seize.
- (loud bang)

579
00:30:40.776 --> 00:30:42.447
Any questions
about any of that?

580
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:45.550
Um...

581
00:30:48.419 --> 00:30:49.488
No.

582
00:30:49.687 --> 00:30:50.655
Okay.

583
00:30:51.155 --> 00:30:53.192
We'll just leave
a copy of that for you.

584
00:30:53.758 --> 00:30:55.294
Garrick:
Yeah. we'll leave a copy.

585
00:30:57.295 --> 00:31:00.265

Garrick:

589
00:31:35.263 --> 00:31:37.632
<i>all this stems from

590

00:31:43.972 --> 00:31:46.411

It-it does now. Um...

596
00:31:56.151 --> 00:31:59.124
When I started working
at White Law. I...

597
00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:03.028
- Do you guys know PKI passwords?
- Taylor: Mm-hmm.

598
00:32:03.527 --> 00:32:07.095
So I had a printed-out email.
and I put it in a folder.

599
00:32:07.095 --> 00:32:09.697
I didn't have a desk yet.
so I. I took it with me

600
00:32:09.697 --> 00:32:12.267
and passed through security
and went to Starbucks.

601
00:32:12.267 --> 00:32:16.037
And when I came back.
they searched through it.

602
00:32:16.037 --> 00:32:17.538
And unfortunately.

603
00:32:17.538 --> 00:32:20.142
the email I had printed out
was classified.

604
00:32:20.142 --> 00:32:22.044
and. uh. they. they
filed a report for that.

605
00:32:22.044 --> 00:32:23.345
Garrick:
Okay. Alright.

606
00:32:23.345 --> 00:32:25.046
And. uh. what's
your work role there

607
00:32:25.046 --> 00:32:26.151
at. at White Law?

608
00:32:26.583 --> 00:32:30.622
Currently. I translate
graphics documents.
and. um...

609
00:32:32.322 --> 00:32:34.426
- Yeah. that's all I do.
- Garrick: Okay.

610
00:32:34.859 --> 00:32:36.161
From Farsi to English.

611
00:32:36.995 --> 00:32:40.195
So you're assigned
to a specific section.

612
00:32:40.195 --> 00:32:41.563
- I guess. or group?
- Reality: Yes.

613
00:32:41.563 --> 00:32:44.699
Uh. it's the Iranian
Aerospace Forces Office.

614
00:32:44.699 --> 00:32:47.306
Have you been assigned there
your entire time there?

615
00:32:47.667 --> 00:32:49.208
Reality:
Yes. since February.

616
00:32:50.708 --> 00:32:51.774
Okay.
(clears throat)

617
00:32:51.774 --> 00:32:53.142
Uh. is there
any other issues

618
00:32:53.142 --> 00:32:55.076
or anything you're aware of
that might explain

619
00:32:55.076 --> 00:32:56.846
why that report
was generated?

620
00:32:56.846 --> 00:33:00.019
Like. ah. maybe this.
maybe that.

621
00:33:00.985 --> 00:33:02.221
No.

622
00:33:03.654 --> 00:33:04.723
No. Okay.

623
00:33:05.256 --> 00:33:08.924
Um. so you currently hold
Top Secret/SCI clearance?

624
00:33:08.924 --> 00:33:10.229
Yes.

625
00:33:11.428 --> 00:33:14.029
Garrick:
How long have you had that?

626
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:18.837
Uh. I would say
since January 2013.

627
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:21.373
- While you were
in the Air Force?
- Reality: Yes.

628
00:33:22.607 --> 00:33:24.143
So you kept it through...

629
00:33:26.578 --> 00:33:27.612
through the...

630
00:33:28.374 --> 00:33:29.481
Did you...

631
00:33:30.647 --> 00:33:33.583
<i>I guess when you left
the Air Force.
you kept the...</i>

632
00:33:33.583 --> 00:33:34.653
<i>When did you lea--</i>

633
00:33:35.252 --> 00:33:37.385
When did you process
out of the Air Force?

634
00:33:37.385 --> 00:33:39.889
Uh. I processed out
of the Air Force.

635
00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:42.024
um. December.

636
00:33:42.024 --> 00:33:46.056
uh. December 14th. um. 2016.

637
00:33:46.056 --> 00:33:48.563
And up until that time.
I was looking for contracts

638
00:33:48.563 --> 00:33:50.498
to try and get
my clearance renewed.

639
00:33:50.498 --> 00:33:53.001
So your. uh. clearance
just kind of passed through?

640
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:54.706
It passed through. Yeah.

641
00:33:57.208 --> 00:33:58.610
Okay. Alright.

642
00:33:58.977 --> 00:34:02.510
Um. so. again.
as far as you're aware.

643
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.847
you haven't committed
any security violations

644
00:34:04.847 --> 00:34:06.214
or anything you're aware of

645
00:34:06.214 --> 00:34:08.083
other than this. this

646
00:34:08.083 --> 00:34:10.185
PKI thing?

647
00:34:10.185 --> 00:34:13.525
Other than
the PKI thing. no.

648
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:22.234
I mean...

649
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.436
I-I do print out
documents at work

650
00:34:27.436 --> 00:34:30.972
because it's easier for me
to translate them by hand.

651
00:34:30.972 --> 00:34:33.442
- Taylor: Hmm.
- Reality: But then
I put them in the box.

652
00:34:33.442 --> 00:34:35.143
and then I don't
get it mixed up

653
00:34:35.143 --> 00:34:37.112
with. like. my.
my classified notes

654
00:34:37.112 --> 00:34:38.583
because they. uh...

655
00:34:40.217 --> 00:34:42.787
I use pretty paper.

656
00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.624
<i>So I don't take out
white paper.</i>

657
00:34:47.592 --> 00:34:49.561
Mm. Got it.

658
00:34:50.127 --> 00:34:51.559
An-and I know it sounds
really dumb.

659
00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:55.267
but it's just. uh.
it's how I can do it now.

660
00:34:55.733 --> 00:34:58.800
And after this stupid
PKI thing. I was like.

661
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.603
no more white paper
out of the building.
(soft chuckle)

662
00:35:01.603 --> 00:35:04.640
You. you said
you printed out stuff.

663
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.041
Yeah. I printed out--

664
00:35:06.041 --> 00:35:07.509
Garrick:
Is there a. a...

665
00:35:07.509 --> 00:35:10.449
why did that come to mind
as far as security?

666
00:35:14.386 --> 00:35:15.654
I guess

667
00:35:16.287 --> 00:35:18.790
I'm. um. just trying
to think about

668
00:35:19.924 --> 00:35:21.121
actual paper.

669
00:35:21.692 --> 00:35:23.758
Um. I can't imagine
any other way

670
00:35:23.758 --> 00:35:26.398
to get things out
of the building. I guess.

671
00:35:26.697 --> 00:35:30.365
I mean. I-I'm old fashioned.
so thinking about that.

672
00:35:30.365 --> 00:35:34.469
And (sighs)
just with this PKI thing.

673
00:35:34.469 --> 00:35:36.171
just making sure I don't
accidentally have anything

674
00:35:36.171 --> 00:35:37.705
in my lunch box
or anything like--

675
00:35:37.705 --> 00:35:39.574
- Taylor: Nothing got
out of the building?
- Nothing.

676
00:35:39.574 --> 00:35:41.410
You didn't carry anything
out of the building?

677
00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.612
No. No. And I definitely
let everything get searched
all the time.

678
00:35:44.612 --> 00:35:47.182
So I haven't had
any other accidents.

679
00:35:47.182 --> 00:35:48.487
(Taylor sighs)

680
00:35:50.021 --> 00:35:51.590
Do you work
on any other matters?

681
00:35:52.022 --> 00:35:52.954
No.

682
00:35:52.954 --> 00:35:54.259
Okay.

683
00:35:55.492 --> 00:35:58.593
Have you ever inadvertently.
either by accident

684
00:35:58.593 --> 00:36:00.728
or. or intentionally
or whatever.

685
00:36:00.728 --> 00:36:04.636
uh. gone outside your
need to know on items?

686
00:36:05.169 --> 00:36:08.504
Outside my
need to know on items?

687
00:36:08.504 --> 00:36:09.608
Um...

688
00:36:11.075 --> 00:36:13.241
I do from time to time

689
00:36:13.241 --> 00:36:15.280
look at a website
called My Online.

690
00:36:15.679 --> 00:36:18.646
- It's. uh. drone feeds.
- Garrick: Okay.

691
00:36:18.646 --> 00:36:22.217
I used to work a drone mission.
so it's all Afghan stuff.

692
00:36:22.217 --> 00:36:25.224
But other than that.
just. uh...

693
00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.890
reading basic
news articles on NSA Net.

694
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.060
But I've never accessed
anything that's outside of--

695
00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.196
Okay. Have you ever
gone searching for stuff

696
00:36:34.196 --> 00:36:37.361
that's not related to your.
uh. your work role?

697
00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:38.470
No.

698
00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:40.439
Garrick:
Okay.

699
00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:43.872
You kind of already
answered this.

700
00:36:43.872 --> 00:36:48.143
But outside of the PKI.
have you ever taken anything

701
00:36:48.143 --> 00:36:50.946
outside of the.
uh. uh. the NSA facility?

702
00:36:50.946 --> 00:36:52.714
- No.
- Garrick: No?

703
00:36:52.714 --> 00:36:55.383
Uh. have you
downloaded anything?
Emailed anything out?

704
00:36:55.383 --> 00:36:57.752
- No.
- Garrick: No? Okay.

705
00:36:57.752 --> 00:37:00.422
Have you ever discussed.
uh. any classified material

706
00:37:00.422 --> 00:37:01.623
with anybody
who wouldn't have

707
00:37:01.623 --> 00:37:03.925
the. uh. prior
US government authorization?

708
00:37:03.925 --> 00:37:05.826
Who wouldn't have the clearance
or anything like that?

709
00:37:05.826 --> 00:37:07.996
Who wouldn't have the clearance
and the need to know?

710
00:37:07.996 --> 00:37:09.334
No.

711
00:37:10.034 --> 00:37:12.471
No? Okay.

712
00:37:13.132 --> 00:37:16.204
Not many people ask
about Iranian aerospace.

713
00:37:16.204 --> 00:37:18.710
so. uh... I lucked out.

714
00:37:19.343 --> 00:37:21.176
So you never discussed.
uh. discussed work

715
00:37:21.176 --> 00:37:22.982
or anything classified
with anybody?

716
00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:26.685
Uh-uh.

717
00:37:29.553 --> 00:37:30.990
Taylor:
How's the neighborhood?

718
00:37:34.858 --> 00:37:37.460
I. I did not look at a map
when I signed the lease.

719
00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.495
But I am well armed.

720
00:37:40.495 --> 00:37:42.431
- You seem to be.
- (Reality chuckles)

721
00:37:42.431 --> 00:37:43.899
What's your plans?

722
00:37:43.899 --> 00:37:45.200
You gonna stay in the house

723
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.301
or you gonna move
somewhere else or...

724
00:37:46.301 --> 00:37:48.164
Di-did you sign
a lease. I guess?

725
00:37:48.164 --> 00:37:50.338
I signed a lease.
and I would only break it

726
00:37:50.338 --> 00:37:51.374
if I get a deployment.

727
00:37:51.374 --> 00:37:52.544
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

728
00:37:53.044 --> 00:37:56.212
Have you had any issues here
since you moved here?

729
00:37:56.212 --> 00:37:57.913
I did. yeah.

730
00:37:57.913 --> 00:37:59.018
Garrick:
What happened?

731
00:37:59.616 --> 00:38:03.485
I was coming home from a concert
in Atlanta and it was 3:00 a.m..

732
00:38:03.485 --> 00:38:08.323
and. uh. there was a. a guy
standing on the street.

733
00:38:08.323 --> 00:38:10.921
And I wanted to make sure
that he didn't see me go

734
00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:12.360
from like my car
to my. my door.

735
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.995
And I thought
I'd timed it out well.

736
00:38:13.995 --> 00:38:16.431
But then I was standing
at the sink getting water

737
00:38:16.431 --> 00:38:18.234
and then someone starts knocking
at the door and I was like--

738
00:38:18.234 --> 00:38:19.471
(door opens)

739
00:38:20.637 --> 00:38:22.908
- Do you have a toothpick?
- Taylor: Huh?

740
00:38:25.243 --> 00:38:26.411
(door slams)

741
00:38:29.113 --> 00:38:31.379
Uh. it's. uh. 3:00 a.m..

742
00:38:31.379 --> 00:38:34.750
and. uh. my-my-my keys
and my phone were by the door

743
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:36.351
'cause that's where
I dropped them.

744
00:38:36.351 --> 00:38:38.057
'cause I had to pee.
so. uh.

745
00:38:38.889 --> 00:38:41.557
very glad to have a.
a Glock Nine in the back.

746
00:38:41.557 --> 00:38:42.892
Garrick:
Oh. yeah.

747
00:38:42.892 --> 00:38:43.792
Did not sleep.

748
00:38:43.792 --> 00:38:45.097
- (Garrick laughing)
- Taylor: I'm sure.

749
00:38:46.598 --> 00:38:48.328
Anything other than that?

750
00:38:50.034 --> 00:38:52.501
Other than that? Um...

751
00:38:52.501 --> 00:38:54.069
(Garrick coughs and sniffles)

752
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:55.407
There's this...

753
00:38:55.972 --> 00:38:59.674
(chuckles) People always ask
if you want your lawn done.

754
00:38:59.674 --> 00:39:02.310
And. uh. someone came
and mowed my lawn

755
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:03.779
while I was
in Belize last week.

756
00:39:03.779 --> 00:39:06.214
so. uh. not really cool
with that.

757
00:39:06.214 --> 00:39:07.983
- I imagine not.
- Yeah.

758
00:39:07.983 --> 00:39:09.245
They're probably
gonna come by.

759
00:39:09.245 --> 00:39:10.653
knock on the door.
and ask for compensation.

760
00:39:10.653 --> 00:39:12.054
Reality: Yeah.
(laughs)

761
00:39:12.054 --> 00:39:13.254
I mean.
if it's the same guy

762
00:39:13.254 --> 00:39:14.422
I paid last time.

763
00:39:14.422 --> 00:39:16.324
he's like this
little old man.

764
00:39:16.324 --> 00:39:19.128
like. in his 80s.
so I won't really be mad.

765
00:39:19.128 --> 00:39:21.196
- But--
- When. uh.

766
00:39:21.196 --> 00:39:23.035
when did you go
to Belize?

767
00:39:24.568 --> 00:39:28.103
I left on Saturday morning
and flew back

768
00:39:28.103 --> 00:39:29.708
Monday morning. uh.

769
00:39:30.442 --> 00:39:31.743
last weekend.

770
00:39:33.244 --> 00:39:34.476
That was a quick trip
to Belize.

771
00:39:34.476 --> 00:39:35.680
(Reality chuckles)

772
00:39:37.181 --> 00:39:38.650
It was a quick trip.

773
00:39:39.211 --> 00:39:40.648
Taylor:
What you go down there for?

774
00:39:40.648 --> 00:39:44.053
I wanted to see
the Mayan pyramids.

775
00:39:44.053 --> 00:39:45.186
{\an8}Taylor:
Okay.

776
00:39:45.186 --> 00:39:46.755
{\an8}Reality: (chuckles)
<i>So. yeah.</i>

777
00:39:46.755 --> 00:39:48.557
{\an8}Taylor:
<i>That's pretty cool.</i>

778
00:39:48.557 --> 00:39:50.091
{\an8}Reality:
I-I didn't have any leave.

779
00:39:50.091 --> 00:39:53.595
so I was tired of waiting
for the stars to align.

780
00:39:53.595 --> 00:39:55.664
- So I just said...
- Taylor: Sure.

781
00:39:55.664 --> 00:39:57.293
...got three days.
let's do it.

782
00:39:57.293 --> 00:39:58.600
- Taylor: That's cool.
- Garrick: Fair enough.

783
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.705
Spur of the moment.
that's pretty cool.

784
00:40:01.671 --> 00:40:03.675
Did you go down there
by yourself or...

785
00:40:04.376 --> 00:40:06.542
Yeah. by myself.

786
00:40:06.542 --> 00:40:08.343
Garrick:
Okay. Did you

787
00:40:08.343 --> 00:40:10.482
do any tours or anything
down there?

788
00:40:11.115 --> 00:40:12.148
I did.

789
00:40:12.148 --> 00:40:14.282
Um. I...

790
00:40:14.282 --> 00:40:16.419
The. the first day.
I went on. like.

791
00:40:16.419 --> 00:40:18.653
a Altun Ha tour.

792
00:40:18.653 --> 00:40:21.256
Uh... that was one of
the first sites.

793
00:40:21.256 --> 00:40:24.259
And then the second day.
we did. um.

794
00:40:24.259 --> 00:40:26.261
uh. we took a boat
on a river

795
00:40:26.261 --> 00:40:27.730
down to the Lamanai pyramids.

796
00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:29.134
And then we came back and...

797
00:40:30.969 --> 00:40:32.137
Yeah.

798
00:40:33.438 --> 00:40:35.207
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

799
00:40:36.106 --> 00:40:37.876
Saw a bunch of monkeys.

800
00:40:39.076 --> 00:40:42.444
So you're positive you've
never printed anything out

801
00:40:42.444 --> 00:40:44.549
that was outside
of your work role?

802
00:40:48.052 --> 00:40:49.051
(sighs)

803
00:40:49.051 --> 00:40:50.852
Uh. I'm trying to think.

804
00:40:50.852 --> 00:40:51.991
Um...

805
00:40:52.924 --> 00:40:54.122
uh...

806
00:40:54.122 --> 00:40:57.025
because there's. um. there's.

807
00:40:57.025 --> 00:40:58.521
there's NSA Pulse.

808
00:40:58.521 --> 00:41:01.934
and. uh. from time to time.
I. I do print out articles

809
00:41:02.599 --> 00:41:05.634
from that and use
as scratch paper.

810
00:41:05.634 --> 00:41:08.469
Uh. th-that sounds
really dumb.

811
00:41:08.469 --> 00:41:10.705
Uh. (laughs) now that
I'm thinking about it.

812
00:41:10.705 --> 00:41:13.641
the things that I. I did
were r-r-r-really dumb. uh.

813
00:41:13.641 --> 00:41:16.011
But then. I always threw it out
in the burn bin.

814
00:41:16.011 --> 00:41:17.279
Garrick:
Okay.

815
00:41:17.279 --> 00:41:18.914
<i>What kind of articles
from Pulse do you pull out?</i>

816
00:41:18.914 --> 00:41:20.681
- (keyboard clacking)
- (dog barking)

817
00:41:20.681 --> 00:41:23.018
Reality:
<i>Uh. usually reference
material about. like...</i>

818
00:41:23.018 --> 00:41:24.486
(beeping)

819
00:41:24.486 --> 00:41:26.789
<i>...uh. just making sure.
like. so many references</i>

820
00:41:26.789 --> 00:41:28.823
<i>that I keep having
to re-look up.</i>

821
00:41:28.823 --> 00:41:32.694
so that's probably
a fraud. waste.
and abuse right there.

822
00:41:32.694 --> 00:41:35.200
Taylor:
We're not worried about
fraud. waste. and abuse.

823
00:41:36.067 --> 00:41:37.166
Okay.

824
00:41:37.166 --> 00:41:38.270
No.

825
00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:42.770
I use a lot of papers.

826
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.707
but nothing outside
of Iranian stuff or anything

827
00:41:46.707 --> 00:41:49.345
other than that. and never
outside of the building.

828
00:41:49.345 --> 00:41:50.549
Okay.

829
00:41:51.149 --> 00:41:52.217
Reality.

830
00:41:52.983 --> 00:41:55.017
what if I said that I have
the information

831
00:41:55.017 --> 00:41:56.752
to suggest that
you did print out stuff

832
00:41:56.752 --> 00:41:58.657
that was outside
of that scope?

833
00:42:02.226 --> 00:42:03.996
I mean. I would...

834
00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:06.231
I would try to remember.

835
00:42:07.465 --> 00:42:08.531
Garrick:
Okay.

836
00:42:08.531 --> 00:42:09.665
What if I said

837
00:42:09.665 --> 00:42:12.300
that you
printed out information

838
00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.370
related to. uh.
reports on--

839
00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.608
(distortion)

840
00:42:22.112 --> 00:42:23.148
Taylor:
Reality?

841
00:42:24.348 --> 00:42:25.580
Uh...
(chuckles)

842
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.682
we obviously know
a lot more than.

843
00:42:27.682 --> 00:42:29.588
than what we're
telling you at this point.

844
00:42:30.988 --> 00:42:32.720
And I think. I think
you know a lot more

845
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.493
than what you're telling us
at this point.

846
00:42:35.226 --> 00:42:37.593
I don't want you
to go down the wrong road.

847
00:42:37.593 --> 00:42:40.029
I think you need to. to stop

848
00:42:40.029 --> 00:42:42.631
and think about
what you're saying

849
00:42:42.631 --> 00:42:43.969
and what you're doing.

850
00:42:44.668 --> 00:42:47.269
I think it-it-it's an.
an opportunity

851
00:42:47.269 --> 00:42:48.538
to maybe tell the truth.

852
00:42:48.538 --> 00:42:50.672
Because t-telling a.

853
00:42:50.672 --> 00:42:53.809
telling a lie
to an FBI agent

854
00:42:53.809 --> 00:42:55.680
is not going to be
the right thing.

855
00:42:56.448 --> 00:42:57.379
Okay?

856
00:42:57.379 --> 00:42:59.919
Uh. you know.
uh. again.

857
00:43:00.718 --> 00:43:02.918
we're here voluntarily.

858
00:43:02.918 --> 00:43:05.790
You're talking voluntarily.

859
00:43:06.123 --> 00:43:09.525
I'm not asking you.
forcing you to do anything

860
00:43:09.525 --> 00:43:10.795
but think.

861
00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:14.133
That-that-that's what
I'm asking you to do is think.

862
00:43:15.566 --> 00:43:17.299
So...

863
00:43:17.299 --> 00:43:19.504
think about
what he just asked you

864
00:43:19.837 --> 00:43:21.140
and let. you know...

865
00:43:32.377 --> 00:43:33.816
There's one
I. uh. printed out

866
00:43:33.816 --> 00:43:35.354
because I wanted to read it.

867
00:43:40.958 --> 00:43:42.861
Can you remember
what day that was?

868
00:43:44.162 --> 00:43:46.731
I might mess up
the dates. but. um...

869
00:43:47.832 --> 00:43:51.070
late. late March.
early. uh...

870
00:43:52.169 --> 00:43:54.339
- early April.
- Taylor: And what was it?

871
00:43:56.106 --> 00:43:58.073
It was an
NSA Pulse article about--

872
00:43:58.073 --> 00:44:00.179
(distortion)

873
00:44:02.613 --> 00:44:05.017
- Garrick: Okay.
- And. uh...

874
00:44:06.317 --> 00:44:07.647
I did print that one out.

875
00:44:10.422 --> 00:44:11.390
Garrick:
Okay.

876
00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:14.393
Why...
(clears throat)

877
00:44:14.892 --> 00:44:16.328
Why did you print
that one out?

878
00:44:17.962 --> 00:44:20.495
Um. because I wanted
to read it. (scoffs)

879
00:44:20.495 --> 00:44:23.599
Uh. the way
I. I downloaded it.
it was hard to read.

880
00:44:23.599 --> 00:44:25.201
so. um...

881
00:44:25.201 --> 00:44:27.135
uh. just.

882
00:44:27.135 --> 00:44:29.632
it looked like
a. a piece of history.
you know?

883
00:44:29.632 --> 00:44:32.077
And I. I wanted it on my desk
for. like. a day.

884
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.080
Did you. uh...
H-how did you find it?

885
00:44:36.748 --> 00:44:38.747
Uh. so if you go
on Pulse.

886
00:44:38.747 --> 00:44:40.950
there's a...

887
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:43.452
uh. the top right.
they have a tab

888
00:44:43.452 --> 00:44:46.656
that says "articles."
and I. I scroll through those.

889
00:44:46.656 --> 00:44:48.757
(stammers) Uh...

890
00:44:48.757 --> 00:44:49.858
I don't know
if you guys saw the one

891
00:44:49.858 --> 00:44:51.960
about the
miniature ponies. but...

892
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.329
- We missed that one.
- Reality: Yeah.

893
00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:54.529
No. that was.

894
00:44:54.529 --> 00:44:55.865
uh. that was number one
for. like. a year.

895
00:44:55.865 --> 00:44:57.733
so obviously I go
to check to see

896
00:44:57.733 --> 00:44:58.901
if there's any other gems.

897
00:44:58.901 --> 00:45:01.036
And then there was.
there was that one.

898
00:45:01.036 --> 00:45:04.105
and I saw it on the news
and I was just like.

899
00:45:04.105 --> 00:45:06.912
yeah. I. uh.
I wanted to read it.

900
00:45:07.745 --> 00:45:09.181
So. yeah.

901
00:45:09.713 --> 00:45:11.383
- Okay.
- What did you do
with the article?

902
00:45:11.949 --> 00:45:15.154
I kept it on my desk
for. like. three days.

903
00:45:17.321 --> 00:45:19.491
(heavy breathing)

904
00:45:20.525 --> 00:45:21.927
I'm going to be honest.

905
00:45:25.195 --> 00:45:27.166
I only read. like.
half of it.

906
00:45:27.999 --> 00:45:30.065
It was the stupidest thing ever.

907
00:45:30.065 --> 00:45:31.832
Uh. and then. and then
I burned bagged it

908
00:45:31.832 --> 00:45:34.473
in the box with the slat.
uh. next to the fridge.

909
00:45:35.105 --> 00:45:38.206
Taylor: Okay. Uh. did you
print out any other articles?

910
00:45:38.206 --> 00:45:40.476
No. no. I just.
just. only the one.

911
00:45:40.476 --> 00:45:42.138
Garrick:
Okay.

912
00:45:42.138 --> 00:45:43.248
Talking around it.

913
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:46.214
You're pretty sure it was
late April. early March.

914
00:45:46.214 --> 00:45:47.983
Think about. uh.
try to remember. like.

915
00:45:47.983 --> 00:45:49.217
details in your personal life.

916
00:45:49.217 --> 00:45:52.415
I know! I-I'm trying.
I d-- I don't...

917
00:45:52.415 --> 00:45:53.722
{\an8}<i>I don't.
I don't remember.</i>

918
00:45:53.722 --> 00:45:55.558
{\an8}<i>Um. I got in a fight</i>

919
00:45:55.558 --> 00:45:58.360
{\an8}<i>with the boyfriend that week.</i>

920
00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.865
God.
when did I break up with him?
I-I don't remember.

921
00:46:01.432 --> 00:46:03.498
God. I'm. I'm really
blanking on what week.

922
00:46:03.498 --> 00:46:05.300
what the. what the weekend
was like before that.

923
00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.869
- I-I'm so sorry.
- Garrick: It's okay.

924
00:46:06.869 --> 00:46:09.308
Uh. I'm trying. God.

925
00:46:09.806 --> 00:46:12.708
Yeah. Mid-. mid-April
is all I'm thinking.

926
00:46:12.708 --> 00:46:13.742
Garrick:
Okay. Alright.

927
00:46:13.742 --> 00:46:15.343
What if I tell you
that I know

928
00:46:15.343 --> 00:46:17.547
that you searched for
and printed out a document

929
00:46:17.547 --> 00:46:19.251
on the ninth of May?

930
00:46:20.619 --> 00:46:21.987
The ninth of May?

931
00:46:23.248 --> 00:46:24.756
{\an8}<i>Uh. let me see.</i>

932
00:46:25.289 --> 00:46:29.028
{\an8}The CrossFit competition
was on the 12th.

933
00:46:29.994 --> 00:46:32.994
God. was it really that late?
Um...

934
00:46:32.994 --> 00:46:34.462
I-I-I mean.
I can't argue that.

935
00:46:34.462 --> 00:46:37.132
If-if you know. you know.
I mean. obviously you know.

936
00:46:37.132 --> 00:46:39.799
- I mean. I-I just.
I can't imagine.
- Okay. uh...

937
00:46:40.437 --> 00:46:43.442
I mean. I guess
we're already June already.

938
00:46:45.676 --> 00:46:48.143
It's. it's been a really
bad month for me.

939
00:46:48.143 --> 00:46:49.678
Taylor:
Do you remember what you did

940
00:46:49.678 --> 00:46:51.116
to get to that article?

941
00:46:52.249 --> 00:46:54.583
Other than seeing it
on the.

942
00:46:54.583 --> 00:46:55.785
on the front page
or linking it--

943
00:46:55.785 --> 00:46:57.653
Uh. do you remember
what search terms

944
00:46:57.653 --> 00:46:58.754
you might have put in?

945
00:46:58.754 --> 00:47:00.259
(sighs)

946
00:47:08.065 --> 00:47:09.935
Probably--
(distortion)

947
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:14.736
I'm not very sophisticated.

948
00:47:14.736 --> 00:47:16.408
Okay. So...

949
00:47:16.908 --> 00:47:18.607
you did print out
a document.

950
00:47:18.607 --> 00:47:20.609
uh. an intelligence report.

951
00:47:20.609 --> 00:47:22.081
Y-you do recall that?

952
00:47:22.914 --> 00:47:24.984
Yeah. I do remember now. Yeah.

953
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:27.552
Garrick:
Okay. What did you do
with that report?

954
00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.787
I kept it on my desk
for three days.

955
00:47:32.787 --> 00:47:35.757
and. um. I thought
it was interesting
and I would read it.

956
00:47:35.757 --> 00:47:38.761
And then I said. no. I sh--
I should not have this
on my desk.

957
00:47:38.761 --> 00:47:40.496
And so I put it
in the burn bag.

958
00:47:40.496 --> 00:47:42.001
Where's the burn bag?

959
00:47:42.434 --> 00:47:44.066
Reality:
Okay. uh.

960
00:47:44.066 --> 00:47:46.438
it's in the. uh. break room.

961
00:47:47.071 --> 00:47:50.400
Uh. it's the white box
with the little slat on it.

962
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.373
one over from the fridge.

963
00:47:51.373 --> 00:47:53.575
Garrick: So you just
slide it in there and--

964
00:47:53.575 --> 00:47:55.280
- And it's taken care of?
- Yeah.

965
00:47:57.309 --> 00:47:59.051
Okay. Reality...

966
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:01.817
are you sure that's what
you did with it?

967
00:48:01.817 --> 00:48:03.088
Yes.

968
00:48:04.055 --> 00:48:05.390
Garrick:
You're positive?

969
00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:08.691
- Yes.
- Taylor: You didn't take it
out of the building?

970
00:48:08.691 --> 00:48:09.958
No.

971
00:48:09.958 --> 00:48:11.026
Garrick: You didn't take it
out of the building

972
00:48:11.026 --> 00:48:12.127
and give it to anybody?

973
00:48:12.127 --> 00:48:13.996
- No.
- Garrick: You didn't send it?

974
00:48:13.996 --> 00:48:16.265
- No.
- Taylor: You didn't
send it to anyone?

975
00:48:16.265 --> 00:48:17.369
No.

976
00:48:18.235 --> 00:48:19.868
Garrick:
Reality. can you guess
how many people

977
00:48:19.868 --> 00:48:21.440
might have printed out
that article?

978
00:48:23.475 --> 00:48:24.707
Reality:
No.

979
00:48:24.707 --> 00:48:26.278
It's not many.
(chuckles)

980
00:48:26.778 --> 00:48:29.177
That article has made it
outside of NSA.

981
00:48:29.177 --> 00:48:31.683
Okay? Obviously.
because we're here.

982
00:48:33.284 --> 00:48:35.083
And the most likely candidate

983
00:48:35.083 --> 00:48:38.090
by far and away is you.

984
00:48:39.691 --> 00:48:41.457
So now.

985
00:48:41.457 --> 00:48:44.026
I-I-I don't think--

986
00:48:44.026 --> 00:48:45.193
I don't think you're a.
you know.

987
00:48:45.193 --> 00:48:47.997
a. a big bad master spy
or anything.

988
00:48:47.997 --> 00:48:50.065
Okay? I don't.
I don't think that.

989
00:48:50.065 --> 00:48:51.601
I think that I've looked
at the evidence.

990
00:48:51.601 --> 00:48:53.973
and it's compelling.

991
00:48:55.172 --> 00:48:56.905
Now. I'm not sure
why you did it.

992
00:48:56.905 --> 00:48:58.940
and I'm curious
as to that.

993
00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.208
but I think

994
00:49:00.208 --> 00:49:02.043
you might have been angry
over everything

995
00:49:02.043 --> 00:49:04.083
that's going on
politics-wise.

996
00:49:04.983 --> 00:49:06.451
Because you
can't turn on the...

997
00:49:07.385 --> 00:49:09.688
you can't turn on the TV
without getting pissed off.

998
00:49:10.588 --> 00:49:11.623
Or at least I can't.

999
00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:15.427
I think you might have
just made a mistake.

1000
00:49:16.193 --> 00:49:18.160
Now. why I'm here
and why I want to talk to you

1001
00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.662
is to figure out
the why behind this.

1002
00:49:20.662 --> 00:49:22.565
Okay?

1003
00:49:22.565 --> 00:49:24.965
So... I ask you again.

1004
00:49:26.337 --> 00:49:28.007
Did you take it out
and send it?

1005
00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:32.611
I... I didn't.

1006
00:49:33.878 --> 00:49:35.711
I-I-I put it
in the burn bag.

1007
00:49:35.711 --> 00:49:37.712
I mean.
I'm trying to deploy.

1008
00:49:37.712 --> 00:49:39.781
I'm not trying to be
a whistleblower.
That's crazy.

1009
00:49:39.781 --> 00:49:42.051
Garrick: So how would
you think that a document
would end up getting out?

1010
00:49:42.051 --> 00:49:44.320
Uh. I mean...

1011
00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.724
I. I mean...

1012
00:49:48.693 --> 00:49:50.192
Let's be honest. there's.

1013
00:49:50.192 --> 00:49:53.161
there's little to no security
on the documents.

1014
00:49:53.161 --> 00:49:55.130
- I mean. nobody pats you down.
- Garrick: Mm-hmm.

1015
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:56.732
We talk about it all the time
at work. like.

1016
00:49:56.732 --> 00:49:57.866
"Oh. you have
to show our lunch.

1017
00:49:57.866 --> 00:49:58.967
Oh. you eat so healthy."

1018
00:49:58.967 --> 00:50:00.703
like every day.
all the time.

1019
00:50:00.703 --> 00:50:02.104
And people just. they...

1020
00:50:02.104 --> 00:50:05.473
I mean. we. we have a building
full of geniuses. right?

1021
00:50:05.473 --> 00:50:08.243
And. I mean.
I guess I'm just...

1022
00:50:08.243 --> 00:50:10.312
I'm. I'm. I'm talking
and I'm nervous.

1023
00:50:10.312 --> 00:50:12.952
but I-I didn't.
I didn't do anything with it.

1024
00:50:13.617 --> 00:50:15.417
I mean. I-I'm trying
to go somewhere else.

1025
00:50:15.417 --> 00:50:17.585
- I'm trying to increase
my clearance.
- Garrick: Okay.

1026
00:50:17.585 --> 00:50:19.816
I mean. I-- and I know
it was sensitive

1027
00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:21.056
and I thought it
would be cool to have

1028
00:50:21.056 --> 00:50:22.324
on my desk
for a couple days.

1029
00:50:22.324 --> 00:50:23.525
Okay. But do you remember.
you said you remember

1030
00:50:23.525 --> 00:50:25.427
putting it in the.
in the. the burn bag.

1031
00:50:25.427 --> 00:50:26.629
- Reality: Yeah.
- Just sliding it in there.

1032
00:50:26.629 --> 00:50:27.730
Okay.
(clears throat)

1033
00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:29.301
I remember that.
Folded in half.

1034
00:50:30.768 --> 00:50:32.337
Folded in half?

1035
00:50:35.674 --> 00:50:37.676
Yeah. Yeah. um...

1036
00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:39.811
Because it didn't...

1037
00:50:41.713 --> 00:50:43.115
Yeah. uh. folded in half.

1038
00:50:45.415 --> 00:50:47.552
What if I tell you
that that document

1039
00:50:48.481 --> 00:50:49.588
folded in half

1040
00:50:50.354 --> 00:50:52.624
made its way
outside of NSA?

1041
00:50:54.491 --> 00:50:56.324
- I. I don't. I don't--
- Garrick: Made its way out

1042
00:50:56.324 --> 00:50:58.830
in an envelope
postmarked Augusta. Georgia.

1043
00:50:59.629 --> 00:51:02.667
See. things are starting
to get a little specific.

1044
00:51:05.203 --> 00:51:07.603
- Yeah.
- Garrick: Made its way
to an online news source

1045
00:51:07.603 --> 00:51:09.271
that you subscribe to.

1046
00:51:09.271 --> 00:51:11.071
Getting really specific.

1047
00:51:13.477 --> 00:51:15.180
So I'm going
to ask you again.

1048
00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:23.222
What is very. very...

1049
00:51:24.556 --> 00:51:26.191
very compelling...

1050
00:51:29.694 --> 00:51:30.993
I'd like to know
the reason

1051
00:51:30.993 --> 00:51:33.395
because I. I-I don't think

1052
00:51:33.395 --> 00:51:36.432
you make a habit
out of this at all.

1053
00:51:36.432 --> 00:51:38.300
At all.

1054
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.640
I think you just...
messed up.

1055
00:51:42.673 --> 00:51:44.205
Now. I'm not sure
why you did it.

1056
00:51:44.205 --> 00:51:46.411
and I'd like to hear
from you on that.

1057
00:51:47.411 --> 00:51:50.512
But the what and the how

1058
00:51:50.512 --> 00:51:53.452
would you agree...
looks awfully bad?

1059
00:51:55.019 --> 00:51:56.455
It looks really bad. Yeah.

1060
00:51:58.456 --> 00:52:00.359
If you're angry
about what's going on.

1061
00:52:01.358 --> 00:52:02.727
if there's anything that...

1062
00:52:05.897 --> 00:52:07.530
Look. you've had
a good career.

1063
00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:08.667
You have.

1064
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.595
If there's something
that just pushed you

1065
00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:12.771
over the edge on this...

1066
00:52:14.438 --> 00:52:16.136
now is the perfect time.

1067
00:52:17.609 --> 00:52:18.743
This is a podium.

1068
00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.947
Taylor:
You know.

1069
00:52:24.947 --> 00:52:27.920
like... like he said.

1070
00:52:29.287 --> 00:52:31.019
I. I don't think
we're coming in here to say

1071
00:52:31.019 --> 00:52:34.822
you're some big. bad mastermind.
prolific spy kind of thing.

1072
00:52:34.822 --> 00:52:38.560
I think what we both think is
that maybe you made a mistake.

1073
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.462
Maybe you weren't thinking
for a minute.

1074
00:52:40.462 --> 00:52:42.334
Maybe you got angry.
like he said.

1075
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.305
I mean.
th-that's what I'm hoping.

1076
00:52:47.071 --> 00:52:48.236
If th-that's the case.

1077
00:52:48.236 --> 00:52:49.704
then that makes us feel
a little better

1078
00:52:49.704 --> 00:52:54.442
knowing we don't have a.
a real serious problem here.

1079
00:52:54.442 --> 00:52:57.382
You know. that's something
that concerns us. too.

1080
00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:01.053
That. that this isn't
an. an ongoing problem.

1081
00:53:01.686 --> 00:53:03.384
But we need
to figure it out.

1082
00:53:03.384 --> 00:53:05.690
And if it was
a mistake...

1083
00:53:07.324 --> 00:53:08.624
let's deal with it.

1084
00:53:08.624 --> 00:53:10.360
(door opens)

1085
00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.961
Agent:
Is this...

1086
00:53:11.961 --> 00:53:13.532
is this a room?

1087
00:53:15.299 --> 00:53:16.668
Agent 2:
Is that a room?

1088
00:53:18.169 --> 00:53:19.371
(door closes)

1089
00:53:29.347 --> 00:53:31.250
So how'd you get it
out of the office?

1090
00:53:49.634 --> 00:53:51.770
Folded in half
in my pantyhose.

1091
00:53:54.505 --> 00:53:58.643
(tense music playing)

1092
00:54:06.751 --> 00:54:07.819
Garrick:
Okay.

1093
00:54:09.053 --> 00:54:10.252
And what did you do
with it?

1094
00:54:10.252 --> 00:54:14.359
(fluorescent lights buzzing)

1095
00:54:19.998 --> 00:54:22.698
I put it in an envelope
and sent it to--
(distortion)

1096
00:54:22.698 --> 00:54:24.669
Taylor:
Anybody specifically there?

1097
00:54:25.303 --> 00:54:27.139
I don't think I put a name.
I just put--

1098
00:54:27.705 --> 00:54:29.671
Had you communicated with them
prior to you doing that? With--

1099
00:54:29.671 --> 00:54:32.368
No. I wasn't trying to be
a Snowden or anything.

1100
00:54:32.368 --> 00:54:33.976
Taylor: And that's what--
I don't think you were either.

1101
00:54:33.976 --> 00:54:35.276
I really don't.

1102
00:54:35.276 --> 00:54:38.080
But I. I. I think
you made a mistake.

1103
00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:40.248
But...
(stammers)

1104
00:54:40.248 --> 00:54:41.684
I don't think
either one of us

1105
00:54:41.684 --> 00:54:43.855
think you were trying
to be Snowden.

1106
00:54:44.721 --> 00:54:47.622
(echoing)
No. it was. it was just
the one document.

1107
00:54:47.622 --> 00:54:49.357
- And like you said. because...
- Taylor: Right.

1108
00:54:49.357 --> 00:54:52.928
...I've had. um. a.
a really hard time at work.

1109
00:54:52.928 --> 00:54:55.797
Uh. I've. I've. I've filed
formal complaints

1110
00:54:55.797 --> 00:54:59.234
about them having
Fox News on all the time

1111
00:54:59.234 --> 00:55:02.337
<i>and. and. like.
for God's sake.
put Al-Jazeera on</i>

1112
00:55:02.337 --> 00:55:04.306
or a slideshow
of people's pets.

1113
00:55:04.306 --> 00:55:05.607
Like. I've tried everything
to get that changed.

1114
00:55:05.607 --> 00:55:07.003
Taylor:
It would probably
be a good thing.

1115
00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:08.076
Unfortunately.
it doesn't matter

1116
00:55:08.076 --> 00:55:09.077
which side you're watching.

1117
00:55:09.077 --> 00:55:10.445
they're all pretty bad.

1118
00:55:10.445 --> 00:55:12.184
- (softly) Yeah.
- Taylor: But...

1119
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:15.720
<i>uh. I think the pets may be
the way to go.</i>

1120
00:55:16.421 --> 00:55:18.181
(rustling)

1121
00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:19.959
Reality: <i>The pets
would have been great.</i>

1122
00:55:20.792 --> 00:55:21.826
<i>Uhm...</i>

1123
00:55:22.726 --> 00:55:25.060
<i>but just having that
every day and then--</i>

1124
00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.366
(distortion)

1125
00:55:30.963 --> 00:55:32.637
Where'd you mail it from?

1126
00:55:40.379 --> 00:55:42.244
Uh. mailbox

1127
00:55:42.244 --> 00:55:45.180
on. uh. Baston Road.

1128
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.514
Taylor:
Okay.

1129
00:55:46.514 --> 00:55:48.717
It's. uh. it's.
uh. the shopping center

1130
00:55:48.717 --> 00:55:52.621
with the bank and
the Earth Fare
gro-gro-grocery store.

1131
00:55:52.621 --> 00:55:54.156
Okay. I know
where you're talking about.

1132
00:55:54.156 --> 00:55:56.025
At the intersection
of Baston Road

1133
00:55:56.025 --> 00:55:57.492
and F-Fury's Ferry.

1134
00:55:57.492 --> 00:55:58.793
- Taylor: Fury's Ferry. Okay.
- Garrick: Mm-hmm.

1135
00:55:58.793 --> 00:56:01.930
I never could say that right.
Fur-Fury's Ferry.

1136
00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:03.498
Taylor: And it was just
a mailbox sittin' out

1137
00:56:03.498 --> 00:56:05.195
in the middle
of the parking lot?

1138
00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:06.939
Reality: <i>Mm-hmm.
Just a metal box. yeah.</i>

1139
00:56:09.273 --> 00:56:11.043
- Okay.
- Garrick: Okay.

1140
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:20.652
Taylor:
Do you remember
what day it was?

1141
00:56:22.519 --> 00:56:25.424
(sighs)
What day of the week
was the ninth?

1142
00:56:26.023 --> 00:56:27.857
Let's see. Um...

1143
00:56:27.857 --> 00:56:28.994
Uh. we'll check.

1144
00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.692
Need some water
or something?

1145
00:56:31.692 --> 00:56:33.261
I'd like some water
once we figure out

1146
00:56:33.261 --> 00:56:34.295
what day of
the week it was.

1147
00:56:34.295 --> 00:56:35.263
- Okay.
- Taylor: Let's see.

1148
00:56:35.263 --> 00:56:37.232
I want to say
it was. uh.

1149
00:56:37.232 --> 00:56:39.300
if I can figure out
this crazy phone.

1150
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:40.703
I want to say
it was a Tuesday.

1151
00:56:40.703 --> 00:56:42.174
- Tuesday?
- Taylor: Yeah.

1152
00:56:42.972 --> 00:56:45.107
Garrick: Is there something
significant about the ninth

1153
00:56:45.107 --> 00:56:47.376
- in other ways?
- No. Uh. it was.

1154
00:56:47.376 --> 00:56:49.545
it was just
the first day I saw it. uh.

1155
00:56:49.545 --> 00:56:51.246
If it... if. if...

1156
00:56:51.246 --> 00:56:53.182
It might have been
the 11th or the 12th

1157
00:56:53.182 --> 00:56:56.151
if. if I subbed yoga
on the.

1158
00:56:56.151 --> 00:56:57.519
on the night of the 11th.

1159
00:56:57.519 --> 00:56:59.220
then. uh. the yoga studio
is right there.

1160
00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.423
Taylor:
So it would have been
a Thursday or Friday?

1161
00:57:01.423 --> 00:57:03.195
- (whispers) Thursday or Friday.
- Taylor: Okay.

1162
00:57:04.262 --> 00:57:06.194
What yoga studio?

1163
00:57:06.194 --> 00:57:09.197
Uh. it's called
Oh Yeah Yoga.

1164
00:57:09.197 --> 00:57:10.666
So. you said maybe

1165
00:57:10.666 --> 00:57:13.168
you mailed it
Thursday or Friday?

1166
00:57:13.168 --> 00:57:15.370
- Reality: Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

1167
00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:19.375
How did you know to.
uh. mail it to--

1168
00:57:19.375 --> 00:57:21.680
(distortion)

1169
00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:30.122
(tense music playing)

1170
00:57:47.271 --> 00:57:48.804
(scoffs. mutters)

1171
00:57:48.804 --> 00:57:51.243
(distortion)

1172
00:57:52.742 --> 00:57:54.980
Garrick: So you wanted
to be able to publish it?

1173
00:57:56.281 --> 00:57:57.216
Yeah.

1174
00:57:57.849 --> 00:57:59.415
Taylor:
Did you send it
anywhere else?

1175
00:57:59.415 --> 00:58:00.920
- No.
- Taylor: No?

1176
00:58:01.652 --> 00:58:02.952
No other publications

1177
00:58:02.952 --> 00:58:04.920
you've shown it to
or given it to?

1178
00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.755
No. (sniffles)

1179
00:58:06.755 --> 00:58:07.889
Is there gonna be
anything here

1180
00:58:07.889 --> 00:58:09.424
that we're gonna be
surprised to find?

1181
00:58:09.424 --> 00:58:11.159
No. I. I never took
the document
out of my car.

1182
00:58:11.159 --> 00:58:13.598
Taylor: Is there anything
on your phone or your computer?

1183
00:58:14.799 --> 00:58:16.765
On my. on my phone.
you might.

1184
00:58:16.765 --> 00:58:18.199
I don't. I don't know
if I deleted it.

1185
00:58:18.199 --> 00:58:19.935
but you guys are probably going
to be able to see it anyway.

1186
00:58:19.935 --> 00:58:23.608
but there will be
a screenshot of the address.

1187
00:58:27.546 --> 00:58:29.748
- Okay.
- Taylor: Okay.

1188
00:58:30.848 --> 00:58:32.751
Uh. you mentioned
you wanted some water?

1189
00:58:33.813 --> 00:58:35.750
Yeah.

1190
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:37.789
- Yeah. Why don't we. uh...
- No. I'll make it.

1191
00:58:38.417 --> 00:58:41.026
Uh. I'm just gonna
get somebody out here.

1192
00:58:41.993 --> 00:58:44.026
(door opens)

1193
00:58:44.026 --> 00:58:46.361
Hey. can I. can I have
somebody in here. please?

1194
00:58:46.361 --> 00:58:48.528
Uh. do you want
a bottle of water?

1195
00:58:49.568 --> 00:58:50.802
Um...

1196
00:58:52.536 --> 00:58:53.669
Garrick: Do you have
a filter in the fridge

1197
00:58:53.669 --> 00:58:55.170
or do you just want
tap water or...

1198
00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:56.266
Ta-tap water.

1199
00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:59.140
There's. um. a.
a mason jar glass

1200
00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:00.312
next to the sink.

1201
00:59:01.378 --> 00:59:03.278
Garrick:
Can I get one person
to stand here. please.

1202
00:59:03.278 --> 00:59:04.984
so I can go to the kitchen?

1203
00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:34.042
Joe:
You guys. uh.

1204
00:59:34.042 --> 00:59:35.747
you're not going
to fit in there anymore.

1205
00:59:37.781 --> 00:59:39.284
She's not going to fit
in there anymore.

1206
00:59:46.023 --> 00:59:47.422
Taylor:
She's still under the bed?

1207
00:59:47.422 --> 00:59:49.424
- Joe: Huh?
- Taylor: The cat.

1208
00:59:49.424 --> 00:59:51.591
Is the cat
still under the bed?

1209
00:59:53.264 --> 00:59:54.666
She's a big girl.

1210
00:59:56.368 --> 00:59:57.300
(laughs)

1211
00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:00.772
{\an8}(laugh echoes)

1212
01:00:02.674 --> 01:00:04.372
Oh yeah.
we-we're trying.

1213
01:00:04.372 --> 01:00:06.011
(echoing)
Taylor: How old is she?

1214
01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.650
She's three years now.

1215
01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:18.687
But girl likes to eat.

1216
01:00:18.687 --> 01:00:20.025
(slow. distorted)
Joe: Oh yeah.

1217
01:00:20.525 --> 01:00:21.857
Reality:
She likes carbs.

1218
01:00:21.857 --> 01:00:23.926
She's got
a little slim fit on her.

1219
01:00:23.926 --> 01:00:25.064
Mm-hmm.

1220
01:00:25.463 --> 01:00:27.263
She came out.
I was like...

1221
01:00:27.263 --> 01:00:28.597
Both: Whoa!

1222
01:00:28.597 --> 01:00:30.233
(Joe laughs)

1223
01:00:30.233 --> 01:00:31.533
Yeah. (laughs)

1224
01:00:31.533 --> 01:00:33.603
She'll snatch bread
right out of my mouth.

1225
01:00:33.603 --> 01:00:34.703
- Like...
- Taylor: Wow.

1226
01:00:34.703 --> 01:00:36.739
...girl.
you do not need those.

1227
01:00:36.739 --> 01:00:41.641
(Taylor and Joe laughing)

1228
01:00:46.551 --> 01:00:48.320
(raucous laughter)

1229
01:00:50.254 --> 01:00:52.187
(laughter echoes)

1230
01:00:52.187 --> 01:00:53.358
(Garrick clears throat)

1231
01:00:56.661 --> 01:00:58.898
(audio clears)

1232
01:01:01.132 --> 01:01:02.167
Water.

1233
01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:09.774
Thanks.

1234
01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:14.879
(Garrick sighs)

1235
01:01:15.645 --> 01:01:17.979
So other than the screenshot
on the phone.

1236
01:01:17.979 --> 01:01:19.147
there shouldn't be
anything else?

1237
01:01:19.147 --> 01:01:21.484
And there should be nothing
on the laptop?

1238
01:01:21.484 --> 01:01:22.854
Nothing on the laptop.

1239
01:01:26.524 --> 01:01:28.127
I do have a Tor browser.

1240
01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:37.102
Which probably looks bad. but...

1241
01:01:38.537 --> 01:01:40.935
Okay.

1242
01:01:40.935 --> 01:01:43.842
What do you... use.
what do you use
the Tor browser for?

1243
01:02:12.236 --> 01:02:14.236
Garrick:
Have you had any contact
with anyone from--

1244
01:02:14.236 --> 01:02:16.075
(distortion)

1245
01:02:24.415 --> 01:02:25.951
(echoes)
The Intercept?

1246
01:02:27.117 --> 01:02:28.950
Garrick:
Have you tried to reach out?

1247
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:32.087
Like you said.
I saw the article.

1248
01:02:32.087 --> 01:02:34.259
and I couldn't believe
it wasn't a thing.

1249
01:02:35.226 --> 01:02:36.361
It made you mad.

1250
01:02:37.962 --> 01:02:39.932
It made me very mad.

Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

1304
01:04:50.127 --> 01:04:51.330
Say?

1305
01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:53.665
Talk about why?

1306
01:05:03.475 --> 01:05:04.905
I was just...

1307
01:05:07.411 --> 01:05:11.183
I just thought that...
that week

1308
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:15.520
there was just too much
to sit back
and watch it and think.

1309
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:19.658
why do I have this job
if I'm going to be helpless?

1310
01:05:21.325 --> 01:05:22.361
It was just...

1311
01:05:24.395 --> 01:05:25.430
I'm sorry.

1312
01:05:27.998 --> 01:05:29.501
It was just the final straw.

1313
01:05:31.368 --> 01:05:33.438
Was there something
that just

1314
01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:36.375
just... did it.
(snaps fingers)

1315
01:05:37.942 --> 01:05:39.844
Because you don't seem
the type to do this.

1316
01:05:40.544 --> 01:05:42.811
- I-I-I'm not.
- Garrick: I-I-I believe in it.
I wanna believe in it.

1317
01:05:42.811 --> 01:05:44.183
I'm not. I--

1318
01:05:45.883 --> 01:05:48.687
I want to go out
With our Special Forces.

1319
01:05:49.386 --> 01:05:51.587
I mean. that's why I got
out of the Air Force.

1320
01:05:51.587 --> 01:05:52.554
I-I-I...

1321
01:05:52.554 --> 01:05:54.556
It's wh--
it's why I'm here in Augusta.

1322
01:05:54.556 --> 01:05:56.224
I-I was trying to get
my clearance back

1323
01:05:56.224 --> 01:05:57.892
so I could get deployments.

1324
01:05:57.892 --> 01:06:00.961
I-- It just was at a time
I wasn't applying
for deployments. I...

1325
01:06:02.633 --> 01:06:05.100
I had seven. eight months
left of a job

1326
01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.567
that didn't mean
anything to me

1327
01:06:06.567 --> 01:06:08.971
because it's. it's Iran.
and I'm a Pashto linguist.

1328
01:06:08.971 --> 01:06:11.340
Like. what am I doing
translating Farsi?

1329
01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.644
I-I just...

1330
01:06:14.579 --> 01:06:15.944
I felt hopeless.

1331
01:06:15.944 --> 01:06:17.980
And seeing that information

1332
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.115
be contested back
and forth.

1333
01:06:20.115 --> 01:06:22.084
back and forth
in the public domain

1334
01:06:22.084 --> 01:06:24.086
with everything else
that just keeps getting released

1335
01:06:24.086 --> 01:06:26.088
and everything that keeps
getting leaked. like.

1336
01:06:26.088 --> 01:06:28.724
why can't this
get out there?

1337
01:06:28.724 --> 01:06:30.462
Why can't this be public?

1338
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:39.138
Were you surprised
to see us today?

1339
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.977
Yeah. Actually. I thought

1340
01:06:45.542 --> 01:06:47.009
you were here to ask
about the house

1341
01:06:47.009 --> 01:06:49.244
because it's still
for lease online.

1342
01:06:49.244 --> 01:06:51.850
Because you didn't seem
surprised when we pulled up.

1343
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:55.754
Oh. God. That's just because
I have a resting bitch face.

1344
01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:00.522
You guys turn around
and. and "FBI."

1345
01:07:00.522 --> 01:07:03.095
I was like. what is going on.
you know?

1346
01:07:03.693 --> 01:07:07.199
And then you showed
your badge right up and. uh...

1347
01:07:10.334 --> 01:07:13.235
I submitted my
security packet yesterday

1348
01:07:13.235 --> 01:07:14.603
for my clearance on E-QIP.

1349
01:07:14.603 --> 01:07:15.707
So I thought

1350
01:07:16.807 --> 01:07:18.273
that was what it's for.

1351
01:07:18.273 --> 01:07:20.108
I was like.
why are you guys questioning me

1352
01:07:20.108 --> 01:07:21.209
for my own clearance?

1353
01:07:21.209 --> 01:07:22.814
- But...
- Garrick: Okay.

1354
01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:26.485
That's. that's not going
to happen.

1355
01:07:27.685 --> 01:07:29.051
Garrick:
Uh...

1356
01:07:29.051 --> 01:07:30.555
Taylor: Anything else
you can think of?

1357
01:07:31.522 --> 01:07:33.622
Garrick:
What we have to do is
we have to do the search.

1358
01:07:33.622 --> 01:07:34.890
Of course.

1359
01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:37.529
Uh. you said--
(coughs)

1360
01:07:38.095 --> 01:07:39.294
(hacking cough)

1361
01:07:39.294 --> 01:07:41.262
Sorry. I have
a sinus infection.

1362
01:07:41.262 --> 01:07:42.567
- so I sound...
- It's okay?

1363
01:07:43.567 --> 01:07:45.467
Garrick:
I sound awful.
(clears throat)

1364
01:07:45.467 --> 01:07:47.202
Well. this is the best room
to be in it with.

1365
01:07:47.202 --> 01:07:48.503
(Garrick chuckles)

1366
01:07:48.503 --> 01:07:50.442
Taylor:
Do you remember
the site from memory?

1367
01:07:51.742 --> 01:07:55.243
Uh. if you scroll down
to the bottom. there's contact.

1368
01:07:55.243 --> 01:07:57.179
but it-it's not as obvious
as you think

1369
01:07:57.179 --> 01:07:58.680
because it's closer.

1370
01:07:58.680 --> 01:07:59.547
Mm-hmm.

1371
01:07:59.547 --> 01:08:01.186
How long did it
take you to find it?

1372
01:08:03.787 --> 01:08:06.621
<i>About probably three minutes
of scrolling.</i>

1373
01:08:06.621 --> 01:08:09.794
which felt like an eternity
sitting in my car.

1374
01:08:11.295 --> 01:08:12.661
- Taylor: Mm-hmm.
- Garrick: Okay.

1375
01:08:12.661 --> 01:08:14.299
- Yeah.
- Garrick: Uh...

1376
01:08:15.066 --> 01:08:17.236
you said the documents
stayed in your car.

1377
01:08:19.303 --> 01:08:22.207
- Yeah.
- Garrick: Where did you
get the envelope?

1378
01:08:24.241 --> 01:08:26.745
The box of envelopes is...

1379
01:08:28.346 --> 01:08:31.013
it's on the back seat
in the car

1380
01:08:31.013 --> 01:08:32.884
behind the driver's seat.
I--

1381
01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:37.085
I had a bunch of forms
I had to mail out last December.

1382
01:08:37.085 --> 01:08:38.921
so it's been in my car
since December.

1383
01:08:38.921 --> 01:08:40.923
Garrick:
Okay.

1384
01:08:40.923 --> 01:08:42.261
And the stamps?

1385
01:08:42.927 --> 01:08:44.229
Stamps.

1386
01:08:45.362 --> 01:08:48.130
I think I have about one
or two left in there.

1387
01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:50.332
uh. but I-I keep stamps
in the glove box

1388
01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:52.635
in case I have
to mail anything out.

1389
01:08:52.635 --> 01:08:54.202
like bills and stuff.

1390
01:08:54.202 --> 01:08:56.705
Garrick:
Okay. In. in your glove box?

1391
01:08:56.705 --> 01:08:57.842
In the glove box. yeah.

1392
01:08:58.609 --> 01:09:01.342
Garrick: Alright.
Uh. I'm trying to think
if I have anything else.

1393
01:09:01.342 --> 01:09:04.549
Uh. the search. the. the guys
will continue the search.

1394
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:07.115
(voice fading)
Search the vehicle
and the house.

1395
01:09:07.115 --> 01:09:09.421
and they'll photograph everything.

1396
01:09:09.915 --> 01:09:12.353
Um. you. uh.
the search team leader.

1397
01:09:12.353 --> 01:09:14.756
uh. is gonna sit down with you
and go through things...

1398
01:09:14.756 --> 01:09:18.330
(voice inaudible)

1399
01:09:21.265 --> 01:09:23.098

(collar jingles)

1401
01:09:26.503 --> 01:09:28.873
Garrick:
<i>Do you have. uh.
any questions for me?</i>

1402
01:09:30.141 --> 01:09:31.610
Reality:
<i>So many. um.</i>

1403
01:09:34.011 --> 01:09:36.381
This sounds really bad.

1404
01:09:38.348 --> 01:09:40.180
Am I going to jail tonight?

1405
01:09:42.852 --> 01:09:45.187
Garrick: I don't know
how to answer that yet.

1406
01:09:45.187 --> 01:09:46.687
- Okay.
- Taylor: What was the question?

1407
01:09:46.687 --> 01:09:49.257
- Uh. if she's
going to jail tonight.
- Oh.

1408
01:09:49.257 --> 01:09:51.296
Said I don't have the answer
to that quite yet.

1409
01:09:53.497 --> 01:09:55.800
Of course. the. the search
is still going on. uh.

1410
01:09:56.468 --> 01:09:57.802
In the case that...

1411
01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:01.103
I don't have memorized...

1412
01:10:01.103 --> 01:10:03.405
The woman.
her name is Cathy.

1413
01:10:03.405 --> 01:10:05.906
She works at
the Augusta Humane Society.

1414
01:10:05.906 --> 01:10:08.772
- Taylor: Okay.
- She can come and pick up
the dog in the case that

1415
01:10:08.772 --> 01:10:09.811
I-I-I-I'm not here tonight.

1416
01:10:09.811 --> 01:10:12.848
- Taylor: Well. let's don't...
- Garrick: Okay.

1417
01:10:12.848 --> 01:10:14.116
It's just...

1418
01:10:14.116 --> 01:10:15.217
Taylor:
Let's don't put the cart

1419
01:10:15.217 --> 01:10:16.655
before the horse right now.

1420
01:10:17.155 --> 01:10:18.821
Okay.

1421
01:10:18.821 --> 01:10:20.755
Taylor:
Okay?

1422
01:10:20.755 --> 01:10:22.290
- That's just. um...
- Taylor: I understand.

1423
01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:23.758
...my only concern
is getting her

1424
01:10:23.758 --> 01:10:26.294
and then maybe one more phone
call to get the cat covered.

1425
01:10:26.294 --> 01:10:27.796
Taylor:
We'll. we'll figure that out.

1426

that out.

Garrick: And I don't have
the answer to that yet.
And I'm going to...

1429
01:10:34.469 --> 01:10:36.805
We'll. we'll cross that bridge
when we get to it. Okay?

1430
01:10:36.805 --> 01:10:38.207
Okay.

1431

{\an8}One an Air Force veteran.

1469
01:14:20.462 --> 01:14:22.197
{\an8}a loving daughter.
and a yoga instructor.

1470
01:14:22.197 --> 01:14:24.933
{\an8}The other. a person who
had taken a keen interest

{\an8}in the Middle East

01:14:42.851 --> 01:14:45.587
{\an8}could be valuable
to our adversaries
