respect. Mr. Curtis.

185
00:12:19.706 --> 00:12:22.342
I'm a real estate agent.
I'm not your chauffeur.

186
00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:27.680
(sirens wailing)

187
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.383
(suspense music)

188
00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:47.567
- Hey. I like to
apply for the job.

189
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:52.439
- Hey man. We hired a somebody.

190
00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:54.074
we don't need a nobody.

191
00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:55.042
- Ciao.

192
00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:57.044
(man speaks in foreign language)

193
00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:04.084
(cars honking)

194
00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:06.753
(ominous music)

195
00:13:06.753 --> 00:13:09.389
(upbeat music)

196
00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:24.571
- Hey. what can I get you?

197
00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:25.805
- A glass of water please?

198
00:13:28.075 --> 00:13:30.777
(Laura chuckles)

199
00:13:32.445 --> 00:13:33.446
- Thank you.

200
00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:36.249
- Hi.

201
00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:38.451
- Hi.

202
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.820
I'm Laura.

203
00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.457
- I'm Claude.

204
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:52.599
- I haven't seen you in here.

205
00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:55.268
- Out of town.

206
00:13:57.304 --> 00:13:58.138
- Business?

207
00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:00.173
- Sort of.

208
00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:02.809
- What do you do?

209
00:14:04.978 --> 00:14:09.449
- A little bit of this. a
little bit of that. (chuckles)

210
00:14:12.452 --> 00:14:13.653
- Where are you staying?

211
00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:20.660
- Here and there. (chuckles)

212
00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.668
- Well. I hope you
have a nice day

213
00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:32.172
wherever doing whatever.

214
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.342
- Wait. did I say
something wrong?

215
00:14:35.342 --> 00:14:36.376
What did I say?

216
00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:54.327
- Let me guess you like olives?

217
00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:56.496
- Mm-hmm.

218
00:14:56.496 --> 00:14:57.730
- Penny for your thoughts.

219
00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:01.368
- I was thinking I don't
have a place to stay tonight.

220
00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:05.705
- Pita Banger.

221
00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:09.542
Claude Reno.

222
00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:13.413
- Did you say banger?

223
00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:28.061
- Go. go to the bedroom.

224
00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:30.063
I'm gonna slip into
something more comfortable.

225
00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:45.878
- Oh boy.

226
00:15:51.918 --> 00:15:53.920
(yawns)

227
00:15:55.255 --> 00:15:56.423
Tired. (laughs)

228
00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:57.590
- What. hey?
- Come here big boy.

229
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.791
- Hey.

230
00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.927
(laughs) Hey.

231
00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:02.429
Listen. Rita.

232
00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:05.065
- Pa. P. Pita.

233
00:16:05.065 --> 00:16:09.269
- Okay listen. Pita. this
is very embarrassing.

234
00:16:10.937 --> 00:16:12.572
- What?

235
00:16:12.572 --> 00:16:14.074
- I can't.

236
00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:16.476
- (chuckles) Don't tell
me you can't get it up.

237
00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:18.311
- Yeah.

238
00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.279
- Oh. no problemo.

239
00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:22.482
Nothing the big V
here Won't cure.

240
00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.617
- I actually. it's
not even about that.

241
00:16:24.617 --> 00:16:25.452
- What?

242
00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:27.954
- Are you gay?

243
00:16:30.157 --> 00:16:30.990
Shit!

244
00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:37.597
- Good night.

245
00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:42.469
(Pita snores)

246
00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:24.477
- (gasps) Who are you?

247
00:17:24.477 --> 00:17:25.645
What are you doing here?

248
00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:27.480
- My name is Claude.
I'm with Pita.

249
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.848
I'm Pita's friend.

250
00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:31.718
and just I couldn't
sleep with that music.

251
00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:34.154
so I thought we could
talk.

252
00:17:34.154 --> 00:17:35.655
- Are you crazy?

253
00:17:35.655 --> 00:17:36.856
You're waking me up in
the middle of the night

254
00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:37.724
to talk to me.

255
00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:39.359
- I didn't wake you.

256
00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:40.560
- Pita. Pita.

257
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.365
- (shushes) Okay (shushes).

258
00:17:45.365 --> 00:17:47.734
- Get out you son of a bitch.

259
00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:51.070
(door bangs)

260
00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:54.507
(knocking)
- Pita.

261
00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:56.876
(door opens)

262
00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:03.750
- I can't believe it you
brought a total stranger home.

263
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.352
- I'm sorry.

264
00:18:05.352 --> 00:18:07.687
This must have been
especially scary for you.

265
00:18:08.888 --> 00:18:10.523
- Well. at least
he was a looker.

266
00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:15.862
(dog barks)

267
00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:19.031
- Yo check this dude out.

268
00:18:22.068 --> 00:18:24.404
My man how about a cigarette?

269
00:18:24.404 --> 00:18:25.738
- I don't smoke.

270
00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:27.874
- How about forking
over your wallet?

271
00:18:27.874 --> 00:18:29.276
- I don't have one.

272
00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:31.378
- How about we make wallet
out of your face then?

273
00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:32.212
(dramatic music)

274
00:18:32.212 --> 00:18:33.045
- Wait. what the fuck?

275
00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:35.382
(bag thuds)

276
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.253
- Dog. my fucking nose.

277
00:18:40.253 --> 00:18:42.755
(tense music)

278
00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:54.801
- Come on. let's
check that alley.

279
00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:55.635
- Aight.

280
00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:00.273
(woman screams)

281
00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:04.744
- Police. there's somebody
on the fire escape.

282
00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:06.946
- Yo. you see him?

283
00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:10.617
(tense music)

284
00:19:10.617 --> 00:19:13.753
- I can't believe that son of
a bitch broke my nose. man.

285
00:19:13.753 --> 00:19:14.621
- Ah. stop crying.

286
00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:16.423
- Yeah. what's in the bag.

287
00:19:16.423 --> 00:19:19.426
- Shit man. Underwear.
- It figures.

288
00:19:19.426 --> 00:19:20.627
(bottle shutters)

289
00:19:20.627 --> 00:19:21.794
- Don't worry about
it. We'll get his ass.

290
00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:30.136
- Okay. hold it
right there. buddy.

291
00:19:30.136 --> 00:19:31.971
Put your hands where
we can see them.

292
00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:34.307
- What'd you find on him?

293
00:19:34.307 --> 00:19:35.808
- Look like I
can't believe this.

294
00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:38.311
four packs of peanuts
and a dozen condoms.

295
00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:39.812
- Hold him for
suspicion or book him

296
00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:41.814
for attempted
burglary. his choice.

297
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.451
- I'm happy to stay.

298
00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:47.320
- Get this wise ass outta here.

299
00:19:49.989 --> 00:19:52.825
- The city of New York
allows you one phone call.

300
00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:54.494
Make it quick. huh.

301
00:19:54.494 --> 00:19:55.328
- Thanks.

302
00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:02.802
(suspense music)

303
00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:11.010
- I accept the charges.

304
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.979
- Lawrence. what's going on?

305
00:20:12.979 --> 00:20:14.847
- I paid the 60 million
from Chase and Citibank.

306
00:20:14.847 --> 00:20:17.149
but we may need more
shares if we want control.

307
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:19.319
- No there's no if
do whatever it takes.

308
00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:22.188
sell the 20 million
treasuries if you must.

309
00:20:22.188 --> 00:20:23.690
- Who does he
think he's kidding?

310
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.326
- All we need is another wacko
thinking he's Howard Hughes.

311
00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:29.529
I'll call you back.

312
00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:34.867
- [Man] Yo. let me
outta here. man.

313
00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:38.538
- Listen. behave yourself. okay?

314
00:20:38.538 --> 00:20:39.906
Stay out of trouble.

315
00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:41.708
- No problem. officer.

316
00:20:41.874 --> 00:20:44.711
What do you means
stay out of trouble?

317
00:20:44.711 --> 00:20:47.680
(man clears throat)

318
00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:55.422
- What you in for handsome?

319
00:20:56.389 --> 00:20:58.725
- Peeping through a window.

320
00:20:58.725 --> 00:20:59.559
How about you?

321
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.732
- Me?
- Yeah.

322
00:21:05.732 --> 00:21:08.067
- I fucked a goat at
the children's zoo.

323
00:21:08.067 --> 00:21:09.268
- That's very nice.

324
00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:11.070
- Just think about that. huh?

325
00:21:12.572 --> 00:21:14.073
- Is that a felony
or misdemeanor?

326
00:21:14.073 --> 00:21:16.242
Because I really get confused

327
00:21:16.242 --> 00:21:17.243
- You hear that?

328
00:21:18.244 --> 00:21:19.579
- No.

329
00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:21.213
(prisoner bleats)

330
00:21:21.213 --> 00:21:22.048
Hey.

331
00:21:22.048 --> 00:21:23.950
(prisoner bleats)

332
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.084
- Can you purr like that?

333
00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:28.220
You get over here.

334
00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:31.591
(punch thuds)

335
00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:33.125
(prisoner laughs)

336
00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.093
Come here. bitch.

337
00:21:34.093 --> 00:21:36.729
(Ferro groans)

338
00:21:37.897 --> 00:21:38.931
- Fight!
- Yeah. bitch.

339
00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:39.766
Rough for me. man.

340
00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:41.401
Yeah. you liked that. huh?

341
00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:42.435
You really better
like what I got this.

342
00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:44.136
- Hey. big man. back off.

343
00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:45.805
- Come on. I was just
messing with him. man.

344
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.239
(door squeaks open)

345
00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:47.974
Ah God.

346
00:21:49.108 --> 00:21:50.109
I was just kidding. man. damn.

347
00:21:50.109 --> 00:21:51.110
- You aint acting the part.

348
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.612
I aint joking. let's go out.

349
00:21:55.081 --> 00:21:58.117
- I'm engaged to the
system. okay. easy. man.

350
00:21:58.117 --> 00:21:59.952
My finger hurts.

351
00:21:59.952 --> 00:22:03.122
- Promise me.

352
00:22:03.122 --> 00:22:04.657
- I promise you. papa.

353
00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:07.293
(somber music)

354
00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:15.001
- Rise and shine. yo.

355
00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:16.335
Come on. get up.

356
00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:17.637
You can go.

357
00:22:17.637 --> 00:22:18.671
We arrested the two punks.

358
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:19.806
Your story checks out.

359
00:22:19.806 --> 00:22:21.307
You're free to go.

360
00:22:22.141 --> 00:22:23.810
- Can I leave after breakfast.

361
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:24.944
- Come on. you can leave now.

362
00:22:24.944 --> 00:22:26.813
I had enough of this. let's go.

363
00:22:26.813 --> 00:22:27.814
This aint a hotel.

364
00:22:27.814 --> 00:22:28.648
Come on.

365
00:22:34.654 --> 00:22:37.990

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:09.561
- I'm only getting a million.

549
00:32:11.063 --> 00:32:13.432
(man laughs)

550
00:32:19.238 --> 00:32:21.407
- Claude. drop out what
you're doing to get over here.

551
00:32:21.407 --> 00:32:22.408
- Yes. sir.

552
00:32:22.408 --> 00:32:24.076
- Bob.
- Hey. (laughs)

553
00:32:24.076 --> 00:32:25.111
- Bob.
- What?

554
00:32:26.245 --> 00:32:27.546
- Bob.
- What?

555
00:32:27.546 --> 00:32:28.747
Bob. Claude is gonna
take you home now.

556
00:32:28.747 --> 00:32:31.917
- Take Mr. Bod home now.
- No. daddy. no.

557
00:32:32.084 --> 00:32:33.085
- Take--
- No. wait.

558
00:32:33.085 --> 00:32:35.587
- Bob. you're going home now.

559
00:32:35.587 --> 00:32:36.755
- I want Nancy.
- It's okay.

560
00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:37.589
- Help him up.
- Sure sir. sure.

561
00:32:37.589 --> 00:32:39.125
- I want Nancy.
- Daddy.

562
00:32:40.926 --> 00:32:43.429
(phone rings)

563
00:32:48.267 --> 00:32:49.935
- Hello. hello.

564
00:32:49.935 --> 00:32:53.105
- Good work. I
heard on the news.

565
00:32:53.105 --> 00:32:55.407
- (sighs) It's
you're doing. Ferro.

566
00:32:56.775 --> 00:33:00.279
- Listen Lawrence. I want
you to give a bonus of $5.000

567
00:33:00.279 --> 00:33:02.281
to each of my employees.

568
00:33:02.281 --> 00:33:03.815
- [Lawrence] What for?.

569
00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:06.085
- Just tell them it's
from my father's will.

570
00:33:07.153 --> 00:33:08.787
- Okay.

571
00:33:08.787 --> 00:33:10.322
Listen. there's something else.

572
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.292
Dunbar has been
very quiet lately.

573
00:33:14.126 --> 00:33:15.794
but he's promised
to fight it on.

574
00:33:16.628 --> 00:33:17.629
I know he's up to something.

575
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:19.298
but I don't know what it is.

576
00:33:19.298 --> 00:33:20.632
- Goodnight night. Lawrence.

577
00:33:27.473 --> 00:33:28.774
(door closes)

578
00:33:28.774 --> 00:33:30.842
- You took a long
time getting back.

579
00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:31.777
- Jesus.

580
00:33:33.812 --> 00:33:34.646
Mrs. Curtis.

581
00:33:35.781 --> 00:33:36.615
- Kat.

582
00:33:39.485 --> 00:33:40.486
- Mrs. Kat.

583
00:33:40.486 --> 00:33:42.988
( knocks on door)

584
00:33:42.988 --> 00:33:44.156
Go under the bed. under the bed.

585
00:33:44.156 --> 00:33:44.990
- Shit.

586
00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:47.025
- Who is that?

587
00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:47.959
- [Nancy] Nancy.

588
00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:48.794
- Nancy.

589
00:33:51.497 --> 00:33:52.864
Ms. Curtis.

590
00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:53.665
- Surprise.

591
00:33:56.335 --> 00:33:58.337
- Look. I'm really tired and--

592
00:33:58.337 --> 00:34:00.206
- Are you're telling
me you don't want me?

593
00:34:00.206 --> 00:34:03.675
- No. no. no. just
remember I made a choice.

594
00:34:03.675 --> 00:34:05.177
I'm celibate.

595
00:34:05.177 --> 00:34:06.178
- Bad choice.

596
00:34:07.546 --> 00:34:10.048
(Mr. Curtis knocks)

597
00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:10.882
- Who is it?

598
00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.519
- [Curtis] It's Mr. Curtis.

599
00:34:13.519 --> 00:34:15.521
- Shit!
- Yeah.

600
00:34:15.521 --> 00:34:19.691
No. no. no. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. bad choice.

601
00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:27.566
Mr. Curtis.

602
00:34:27.566 --> 00:34:28.867
- I heard your car drive in.

603
00:34:28.867 --> 00:34:30.702
I thought we might
have a little chat.

604
00:34:30.702 --> 00:34:32.037
- Yeah.

605
00:34:32.037 --> 00:34:36.074
(yawns) Can we talk tomorrow?

606
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:37.243
It's really late.

607
00:34:37.243 --> 00:34:40.546
- No. come sit next to me.

608
00:34:42.848 --> 00:34:43.682
- Right there?

609
00:34:43.682 --> 00:34:44.516
Right here.

610
00:34:45.717 --> 00:34:47.519
- Okay.

611
00:34:47.519 --> 00:34:48.854
Right.

612
00:34:48.854 --> 00:34:51.022
- Right there.
- Right there. (chuckles)

613
00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:53.725
- Claude. I'd like
to think of you

614
00:34:53.725 --> 00:34:56.395
as more than just an employee.

615
00:34:56.395 --> 00:34:59.398
- That's very kind of you. sir.

616
00:35:00.732 --> 00:35:03.235
- When I take an
interest in someone

617
00:35:03.235 --> 00:35:04.736
I like to get to know them...

618
00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:08.607
intimately.

619
00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:10.542
- Oh.

620
00:35:13.412 --> 00:35:14.580
I like you too. sir.

621
00:35:17.616 --> 00:35:19.418
I like your whole family.

622
00:35:19.418 --> 00:35:23.088
In fact. it's such a comfort
for a man in my condition

623
00:35:23.088 --> 00:35:26.225
to be in the bosom of
such a warm family.

624
00:35:28.394 --> 00:35:29.261
- What condition?

625
00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:36.802
- I'm really having a hard
time talking about it.

626
00:35:36.802 --> 00:35:37.636
but...

627
00:35:39.905 --> 00:35:44.776
well. it's not contagious
unless you. you know. you--

628
00:35:44.776 --> 00:35:46.745
- We'll talk about
this some other time.

629
00:35:46.745 --> 00:35:48.447
- Okay. good night. sir.

630
00:35:49.948 --> 00:35:52.418
(door bangs)

631
00:35:56.788 --> 00:35:57.623
No.

632
00:35:59.291 --> 00:36:02.794
- You are not going to
be celibate tonight.

633
00:36:02.794 --> 00:36:05.664
- Listen Nancy. please
wait. wait. wait. wait.

634
00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:08.967
actually he's not even
that. I'm impotent.

635
00:36:08.967 --> 00:36:10.469
- Leave it to me
I'll cure you that.

636
00:36:10.469 --> 00:36:13.305
- No. no. the only thing you
can do right now is just leave.

637
00:36:13.305 --> 00:36:14.139
okay?

638
00:36:14.139 --> 00:36:15.140
Just leave.

639
00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.142
- Nobody throws me out of bed.

640
00:36:17.142 --> 00:36:18.477
especially not the help.

641
00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:20.812
You'll pay for this.

642
00:36:20.812 --> 00:36:22.814
- I guess I can live with that.

643
00:36:22.814 --> 00:36:24.316
- You arrogant bastard.

644
00:36:24.316 --> 00:36:25.150
- Good night.

645
00:36:29.655 --> 00:36:30.489
Okay.

646
00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.529
Hey.

647
00:36:44.002 --> 00:36:45.504
Hey.

- Listen Claude.

651
00:37:01.687 --> 00:37:04.523
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

652
00:37:07.192 --> 00:37:08.026
- Good.

653
00:37:09.361 --> 00:37:12.063

654
00:37:13.365 --> 00:37:15.367
Get back to the house.
- Yes. sir.

655
00:37:27.212 --> 00:37:29.047
Have a good day. sir.

00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:32.050
We met before. right?

657
00:37:37.055 --> 00:37:37.889
- I'm afraid so.

658
00:37:43.695 --> 00:37:46.197
(phone dials)

659
00:37:56.742 --> 00:37:58.744
- Pita. you're not
gonna believe this.

660
00:37:58.744 --> 00:37:59.578
- What?

661
00:38:00.746 --> 00:38:03.048

663

- Could I live there with him?

664
00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.722
because I--
- Hey.

665
00:38:10.722 --> 00:38:12.924
Wow. you really
blew him off. huh?

666
00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:15.927
- I heard you rented
the Broderick penthouse.

667
00:38:15.927 --> 00:38:17.062
- Yep.

668
00:38:17.062 --> 00:38:18.263
- That's six
apartments this week.

669
00:38:18.263 --> 00:38:19.798
- It was a good week.

670
00:38:19.898 --> 00:38:21.600
and that creep takes most of it.

671
00:38:23.101 --> 00:38:26.605
- Oh my God. I
think I'm in love.

672
00:38:26.605 --> 00:38:28.106
Did you see him?

673
00:38:28.106 --> 00:38:29.240
- Oh. I know.

674
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.776

Claude was just helping
me with my begonias.

00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:22.754
I'm sorry about what happened
at your friend's place.

703
00:40:22.754 --> 00:40:25.356
- I was more than a
bit surprised to see
you at the office.

704
00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:26.357
- So was I.

705
00:40:27.893 --> 00:40:29.194
Did you like the flowers?

706
00:40:32.063 --> 00:40:33.264
- They were from you?

707
00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:34.399
- It's the least I could do.

708
00:40:34.399 --> 00:40:36.034
I know I scared you.

709
00:40:37.035 --> 00:40:38.069
- You certainly did.

710
00:40:39.938 --> 00:40:40.906
- Am I forgiven?

711
00:40:45.076 --> 00:40:46.077
- I'm Diane.

712
00:40:47.913 --> 00:40:48.747

713
00:40:51.082 --> 00:40:53.585
So where are we going?

716
00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:00.058
- Some miserable old relative.

717
00:41:01.092 --> 00:41:01.927
- I have an idea.

718
00:41:03.094 --> 00:41:03.929
- What?

719
00:41:03.929 --> 00:41:05.263
- Can I come with you?

720
00:41:05.263 --> 00:41:06.431
- Are you're kidding?

721
00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:07.432
- No. I'm dressed for it.

722
00:41:07.432 --> 00:41:10.902
- (laughs) What about Curtis?

723
00:41:10.902 --> 00:41:12.270
- I guess I can have a flat.

724
00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.309
- Hey listen. Diane. can
I buy you a cup of coffee?

725
00:41:19.645 --> 00:41:21.412
That's all I can
afford right now.

726
00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:23.248
- Sure.

727
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:27.318
There's one good thing
about this funeral.

728
00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:28.787
- What?

729
00:41:28.787 --> 00:41:31.122
- The cheaper the funeral.
the faster it goes.

730
00:41:31.122 --> 00:41:32.624
And boy. this guy was cheap.

731
00:41:32.624 --> 00:41:35.293
(Claude laughs)

732
00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:38.964
(organ music)

733
00:41:46.838 --> 00:41:49.140
(priest thuds)

734
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.943
(Claude chuckles)

735
00:41:53.979 --> 00:41:56.982
(priest blows nose)

736
00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:00.318
- Welcome.

737
00:42:00.318 --> 00:42:02.988
Welcome dear bereaved friends.

738
00:42:02.988 --> 00:42:07.358
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the life

739
00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:09.995
not mourn the death of...

740
00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:18.136
- [Man] Silvio Kartorini.

741
00:42:19.204 --> 00:42:21.673
- Yes. not mourn the
death of Silvio Katorini.

742
00:42:24.009 --> 00:42:28.513
He's joining his beloved
wife who died here last year.

743
00:42:29.848 --> 00:42:31.516
Well not here. she...

744
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:33.018
She died last year

745
00:42:33.018 --> 00:42:36.554
and she was well worth
her weight in gold.

746
00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:37.388
(blows nose)

747
00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:40.058
(playful music)

748
00:42:42.027 --> 00:42:44.029
- [Man] Come on guys.

749
00:42:44.029 --> 00:42:48.333
- [Man] Come on. man.

750
00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:50.535
(both laughing)

751
00:42:50.535 --> 00:42:53.171
(car screeches)

752
00:42:56.875 --> 00:42:59.377
- There. there. he's
in a better place.

753
00:43:01.212 --> 00:43:03.581
(blows nose)

754
00:43:18.396 --> 00:43:21.566
- You don't look
like a chauffeur.

755
00:43:21.566 --> 00:43:24.035
You're a little mysterious.

756
00:43:24.035 --> 00:43:25.403
Are you running from the law?

757
00:43:25.403 --> 00:43:27.372
- No. I never had any
trouble with the law

758
00:43:27.372 --> 00:43:28.239
until I got here.

759
00:43:29.274 --> 00:43:30.275
- What happened?

760
00:43:30.275 --> 00:43:33.444
- Mh. it's a long story.

761
00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:35.080
Tell me about you.

762
00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.582
- That is even a longer story.

763
00:43:37.582 --> 00:43:40.752
I grew up. I was an only child
and I was very sheltered.

764
00:43:40.752 --> 00:43:42.587
- Me too.
- You were sheltered?

765
00:43:42.587 --> 00:43:43.922
- No. I was an only child.

766
00:43:43.922 --> 00:43:44.923
I'm sorry. go ahead.

767
00:43:47.258 --> 00:43:48.559
- Are you married?

768
00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:52.097
- No. I love my fun
and freedom too much.

769
00:43:54.399 --> 00:43:55.801
You know I don't
think I'm gonna fit

770
00:43:55.801 --> 00:43:57.268
into your fun and freedom.

771
00:43:57.268 --> 00:43:58.436
so I think ii should just--
- Whoa. whoa.

772
00:43:58.436 --> 00:43:59.771
wait. wait. wait.
wait. what did I say?

773
00:43:59.771 --> 00:44:01.139
- finish it.
- Did I say something wrong?

774
00:44:02.273 --> 00:44:03.441
Okay. let's start over.

775
00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:05.744
This is our first date.
- This is not a date.

776
00:44:05.744 --> 00:44:08.446
- Okay. you said it so
harsh. so emphatically.

777
00:44:08.446 --> 00:44:09.781
what's wrong with the date?

778
00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:13.084
- Nothing. I guess.

779
00:44:13.084 --> 00:44:16.421
I just. I haven't been on
a date like over a year.

780
00:44:16.421 --> 00:44:18.489
- And why is that?

781
00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.759
- My husband died
in the Iraqi war.

782
00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:22.427
- I'm sorry.

783
00:44:24.129 --> 00:44:25.931
How long you
guys were married?

784
00:44:25.931 --> 00:44:27.432
- Nine years.
- Nine years.

785
00:44:29.134 --> 00:44:31.336
Maybe it's time for
now to. I don't know.

786
00:44:31.336 --> 00:44:33.338
start going out a little bit.

787
00:44:33.338 --> 00:44:34.806
just a little tiny. tiny bit.

788
00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:39.010
- (laughs) I don't know why
I feel comfortable talking

789
00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.511
to you about myself.

790
00:44:42.814 --> 00:44:44.315
- I'm glad you feel that way.

791
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.789
- I don't wanna get into it.

792
00:44:50.789 --> 00:44:53.658
but there's another
reason why I was forced

793
00:44:53.658 --> 00:44:56.828
to live back with my
parents after David died.

794
00:44:56.828 --> 00:44:59.697
but it is a hell living
back with my parents.

795
00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:01.499
The pressure never stops.

796
00:45:01.499 --> 00:45:03.501
- I'm keeping my
mouth shut. look.

797
00:45:03.501 --> 00:45:05.636
- (chuckles) No. I
like your concern.

798
00:45:07.005 --> 00:45:09.707
- So we got almost like two
or three hours this time.

799
00:45:09.707 --> 00:45:11.509
I mean if (indistinct).

800
00:45:11.509 --> 00:45:14.012
(piano music)

801
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.884
- I don know why I'm
talking to you about myself.

802
00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:26.357
- I am glad we ran
into each other.

803
00:45:27.993 --> 00:45:30.695
even if this is not a date.
- Me too.

804
00:45:33.031 --> 00:45:35.033
- Anything else?
- No. thanks.

805
00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:38.369
- Can you believe
we've been sitting here

806
00:45:38.369 --> 00:45:40.071
for over two hours?

807
00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:41.206
- I believe it.

808
00:45:43.708 --> 00:45:45.043
- She believes it.

809
00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:55.186
(piano music)

810
00:46:04.229 --> 00:46:07.198
- How long have you been
working with Curtis?

811
00:46:07.198 --> 00:46:09.567
- Three years.
- Three years.

812
00:46:09.567 --> 00:46:10.869
What do you think of him?

813
00:46:11.736 --> 00:46:14.205
- Confidentially. I think
he's a miserable person.

814
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.242
I'm looking for another agency.

815
00:46:19.277 --> 00:46:20.745
How about you?

816
00:46:20.745 --> 00:46:23.414
- Oh. I think they're screwiest
people I ever heard of.

817
00:46:23.414 --> 00:46:24.782
let alone met.

818
00:46:27.886 --> 00:46:31.756
- Can I lend you some money
until your next paycheck?

819
00:46:31.756 --> 00:46:34.092
- No thanks. I'll be okay.

820
00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:35.927
I appreciate it.

821
00:46:40.098 --> 00:46:41.266
So...

822
00:46:50.141 --> 00:46:52.643
- Who is she with?
- I don't know.

823
00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:53.811
- Who is that?

824
00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:58.316
(rising romantic music)

825
00:47:06.157 --> 00:47:08.259
- Tuesday is my day off.

826
00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.295
Can I see you?

827
00:47:13.464 --> 00:47:14.765
- Tuesday is a date.

828
00:47:24.442 --> 00:47:26.144
- Who is that?

829
00:47:26.144 --> 00:47:27.512
- Claude.

830
00:47:27.512 --> 00:47:29.680
He drives for Curtis.

831
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.282
- You've gotta be joking.

832
00:47:32.283 --> 00:47:35.453
You won't give the time of
day to a man. like Stanley

833
00:47:35.453 --> 00:47:37.122
who's been after you for months.

834
00:47:37.122 --> 00:47:40.525
but you have no trouble
kissing the chauffeur.

835
00:47:40.525 --> 00:47:43.161
- I don't care what
he does for a living.

836
00:47:43.161 --> 00:47:44.996
He's a really nice man.

837
00:47:44.996 --> 00:47:45.964
I like him.

838
00:47:48.333 --> 00:47:50.001
Were you spying on me?

839
00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:56.341
- Will you say something.
dear. why do I. oh.

840
00:47:56.341 --> 00:47:58.143
- No. no spying.

841
00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:00.211
She asked.

842
00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:01.046
- All right.

843
00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:06.851
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

844
00:48:07.518 --> 00:48:08.519
I know he thinks it's too much.

845
00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:10.388
I think it's too little.

846
00:48:10.388 --> 00:48:11.356
No. you tell him.

847
00:48:11.356 --> 00:48:12.323
that's what I pay you for.

848
00:48:12.323 --> 00:48:13.191
Just a second.

849
00:48:13.291 --> 00:48:15.893
Here. check out these
apartments for tomorrow.

850
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:19.364
I have Plans. tomorrow is
my day off. Mr. Curtis.

851
00:48:19.364 --> 00:48:21.199
- Change your plans. huh?

852
00:48:21.199 --> 00:48:23.001
We'll just tell them that.

853
00:48:23.001 --> 00:48:23.834
No.

854
00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:27.205
Well. it's not possible.

855
00:48:28.406 --> 00:48:30.008
That's cute.

856
00:48:30.008 --> 00:48:31.209
- Hey. you have to work.

857
00:48:31.209 --> 00:48:32.210
Dont. uh...

858
00:48:34.512 --> 00:48:36.681
Don't distract yourself
with the windows.

859
00:48:36.681 --> 00:48:39.684
- (laughs) I'm
sorry that you have

860
00:48:39.684 --> 00:48:41.519
to spend your day off like this.

861
00:48:41.519 --> 00:48:44.222
- It was hard enough getting
you to say yes to a date.

862
00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:48.526
- Let's get a cab.

863
00:48:48.526 --> 00:48:49.894
- Wait. it's only seven blocks.

864
00:48:49.894 --> 00:48:52.397
Put it on the bosses'
expense account.

865
00:48:57.568 --> 00:48:59.737
(car revs)

866
00:49:03.374 --> 00:49:05.876
(door closes)

867
00:49:13.418 --> 00:49:14.252
Hey.
- Hey.

868
00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:19.624
- (knocks) Wanted to me. sir?

869
00:49:22.093 --> 00:49:23.928
- How dare you!

870
00:49:25.563 --> 00:49:26.597
- Dare what?

871
00:49:26.597 --> 00:49:28.933
- Nancy told me everything.

872
00:49:30.468 --> 00:49:31.769
- Told you what?

873
00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:35.773
- You went to her bedroom.

874
00:49:35.773 --> 00:49:36.774
- That's not true.

875
00:49:36.774 --> 00:49:38.443
- Oh my peaches is lying. right?

876
00:49:38.443 --> 00:49:43.448
- Yes.
- Get outta here you sick bum.

877
00:49:43.448 --> 00:49:45.116
You're fired.
- I'm fired?

878
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:46.117
- You're fired!
- I quit.

879
00:49:46.117 --> 00:49:47.285
Wait a--
- Nothing!

880
00:49:47.285 --> 00:49:48.286
Get out!

881
00:49:48.486 --> 00:49:50.788
- Please Mr. Curtis. why do
you have to talk like that?

882
00:49:50.788 --> 00:49:53.291
- Don't tell me how
that talk you moron.

883
00:49:54.992 --> 00:49:56.627
- You know what. Mr. Curtis?

884
00:49:56.627 --> 00:49:58.263
You can go fuck yourself.

885
00:49:59.164 --> 00:49:59.997
- Oh.

886
00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:02.433
- Wow.

887
00:50:04.969 --> 00:50:05.803
- Shut up!

888
00:50:06.671 --> 00:50:07.838
- I can't believe you did that.

889
00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:09.440
that was fabulous.

890
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.143
(suspense music)

891
00:50:18.316 --> 00:50:19.817
- Let's just get outta here.

892
00:50:19.817 --> 00:50:21.018
- Okay.

893
00:50:21.018 --> 00:50:22.653
- I still don't
know what happened.

894
00:50:22.653 --> 00:50:24.489
- His peaches' memory is fuzzy.

895
00:50:24.489 --> 00:50:25.490
She came on to me.

896
00:50:27.125 --> 00:50:28.826
- Well. you came on to me.

897
00:50:28.826 --> 00:50:30.661
- First of all. she isn't you.

898
00:50:30.661 --> 00:50:32.630
She's a little kid.

899
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:34.665
Secondly. I had a witness.

900
00:50:34.665 --> 00:50:35.500
- Who?

901
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:38.336
- I was tempted to tell him.

902
00:50:38.336 --> 00:50:39.137
- What?

903
00:50:40.171 --> 00:50:41.306
- You really wanna know?

904
00:50:41.306 --> 00:50:43.040
- His wife was under my bed.

905
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.175
- You're kidding.

906
00:50:44.175 --> 00:50:46.477
- No. and there is more.

907
00:50:46.477 --> 00:50:48.346
The daughter is in the closet.

908
00:50:48.346 --> 00:50:49.680
and he tries to hit on me.

909
00:50:50.681 --> 00:50:52.183
- You're telling me he's gay.

910
00:50:52.183 --> 00:50:55.186
- I don't know. maybe
AC/DC. not outted yet.

911
00:50:56.221 --> 00:50:57.555
- How did you get rid of him?

912
00:50:57.555 --> 00:50:59.857
- I told him that I have
a communicable disease.

913
00:51:01.025 --> 00:51:02.493
- That's why he
called you a sick bum.

914
00:51:02.493 --> 00:51:03.561
- Yep. yep.

915
00:51:04.695 --> 00:51:07.698
And wanna know some more?

916
00:51:07.698 --> 00:51:09.200
- What?

917
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.369
- The dog tried to hump my leg.

918
00:51:13.738 --> 00:51:15.240
Is that a sick family or what?

919
00:51:16.741 --> 00:51:18.409
- Do you like his wife?

920
00:51:18.409 --> 00:51:19.244
- She's okay.

921
00:51:21.379 --> 00:51:23.581
So what are we gonna do now?

922
00:51:26.551 --> 00:51:28.386
- You need a place to stay.

923
00:51:28.386 --> 00:51:29.354
Do you have any money?

924
00:51:29.354 --> 00:51:30.721
- Yeah. oh yeah. I got paid.

925
00:51:33.391 --> 00:51:35.693
- Would it scare you if I
asked you to have dinner

926
00:51:35.693 --> 00:51:37.428
at my parents' house?

927
00:51:37.428 --> 00:51:38.696
- No. it sounds great.

928
00:51:48.406 --> 00:51:49.574
- So where do you live?

929
00:51:51.742 --> 00:51:52.543
- California.

930
00:51:53.878 --> 00:51:55.580
- So what are you
doing in New York?

931
00:51:57.282 --> 00:51:59.250
- Looking for a job now.

932
00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:00.585
- Driving a car?

933
00:52:00.585 --> 00:52:01.419
- Dad?

934
00:52:01.419 --> 00:52:02.720
- It's okay. it's okay.

935
00:52:03.788 --> 00:52:06.591
The truth is I just
got fired today.

936
00:52:06.591 --> 00:52:10.060
and I'm afraid I cost
Diane her job too.

937
00:52:11.095 --> 00:52:12.096
- What?

938
00:52:12.096 --> 00:52:14.098
- I wanted a new job.
anyway. dad.

939
00:52:14.098 --> 00:52:16.634
Curtis was a pig. Besides
I'll find a better job.

940
00:52:16.634 --> 00:52:17.435
don't worry.

941
00:52:17.435 --> 00:52:18.436
- Don't worry?

942
00:52:21.439 --> 00:52:23.441
Okay. I won't worry.

943
00:52:27.778 --> 00:52:29.447
- Can I talk to you? Excuse me.

944
00:52:33.784 --> 00:52:38.423
Look. listen. this is
the first time since David

945
00:52:38.423 --> 00:52:40.157
that I've really liked somebody.

946
00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:41.459
please don't ruin it for me.

947
00:52:41.459 --> 00:52:43.127
- Well. how old is he?

948
00:52:44.795 --> 00:52:46.631
- 32. what does it matter?

949
00:52:46.631 --> 00:52:48.999
- 32. doesn't have a job.

950
00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:50.801
Let alone a career
and you're...

951
00:52:53.638 --> 00:52:54.672
Let's go back.

952
00:52:54.672 --> 00:52:56.341
- Probably a lapsed Catholic.

953
00:52:57.308 --> 00:52:59.510
- God. just go
back just be nice.

954
00:53:00.478 --> 00:53:03.147
(whimsical music)

955
00:53:25.002 --> 00:53:26.837
- Do you intend to
stay in New York?

956
00:53:28.506 --> 00:53:31.842
- No. I think I'll do
much better in California.

957
00:53:34.512 --> 00:53:36.847
- You're leaving
New York. Claude?

958
00:53:36.847 --> 00:53:38.048
- Oh. not for awhile.

959
00:53:39.517 --> 00:53:42.186
- A man has to be where he
can do the best for himself.

960
00:53:43.321 --> 00:53:45.990
(whimsical music)

961
00:53:47.325 --> 00:53:50.027
- Well. thank you. We
have to go.

962
00:53:50.027 --> 00:53:51.195
- Thank you.

963
00:53:51.195 --> 00:53:52.029
Thank you.

964
00:53:55.733 --> 00:53:58.503
(playful music)

965
00:54:01.539 --> 00:54:02.840
- You like my pasta?

966
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.675
- Oh. you out did yourself.

967
00:54:04.675 --> 00:54:06.043
- It was good tonight. huh?

968
00:54:08.012 --> 00:54:09.514
- He's got good
manners. you know.

969
00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:12.717
- He acted like he
hadn't eaten in a month.

970
00:54:12.717 --> 00:54:13.718
- Who knows?

971
00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:15.886
- No one knows.

972
00:54:18.723 --> 00:54:21.058
- Oh. I wish I could
live on my own again.

973
00:54:21.926 --> 00:54:22.760
- Why can't you?

974
00:54:25.062 --> 00:54:28.599
- Not now. it's
a very long story.

975
00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:29.434
- Okay.

976
00:54:30.568 --> 00:54:32.870
Hey. what do we do about job?

977
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:34.238
- A job?

978
00:54:34.238 --> 00:54:35.406
Let's look together.

979
00:54:37.575 --> 00:54:41.712
- Hey. can I have yours I
don't like nuts. (laughs)

980
00:54:44.615 --> 00:54:46.717
- You're not gonna believe this.

981
00:54:46.717 --> 00:54:47.918
- [Pita] What?

982
00:54:47.918 --> 00:54:49.587
- We both got fired today.

983
00:54:50.421 --> 00:54:52.089
- What the hell happened?

984
00:54:52.089 --> 00:54:54.425
- [Diane] Curtis's daughter
accused Claude of going

985
00:54:54.425 --> 00:54:55.760
into her room.

986
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:58.896
- (scoffs) Yeah.
yeah. that figures.

987
00:54:58.896 --> 00:55:00.097
- No. it's not like that.

988
00:55:00.097 --> 00:55:01.399
I don't think he did it.

989
00:55:01.399 --> 00:55:03.768
- [Pita] Yeah. yeah. I'm sure.

990
00:55:03.768 --> 00:55:06.270
- Wait. are you seeing this guy?

991
00:55:07.938 --> 00:55:08.773
- Sorta.

992
00:55:10.641 --> 00:55:11.576
- You're nuts.

993
00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:14.479
- Well. I'm tired.

994
00:55:14.479 --> 00:55:15.446
I'm gonna go to bed.

995
00:55:15.446 --> 00:55:17.314
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

996
00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:18.115
Bye.

997
00:55:23.954 --> 00:55:26.323
- Hey. what are you
doing up so early?

998
00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:30.461
- I'm sorry you were fired.

999
00:55:30.461 --> 00:55:31.295
- It's okay.

1000
00:55:32.463 --> 00:55:33.297
- We both know.

1001
00:55:34.599 --> 00:55:35.600
You know what? Take this.

1002
00:55:35.633 --> 00:55:36.467
- What is it?

1003
00:55:37.301 --> 00:55:40.438
- Severance. (chuckles)

1004
00:55:40.438 --> 00:55:41.972
- Thank you.

1005
00:55:41.972 --> 00:55:43.608
- You got a place to stay?

1006
00:55:43.608 --> 00:55:44.442
- Yeah.

1007
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:46.644
- Keep in touch.

1008
00:55:46.644 --> 00:55:49.179
(suspense music)

1009
00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:51.315
- (chuckles) They spent
the entire night trying

1010
00:55:51.315 --> 00:55:53.451
to convince me never
to see you again.

1011
00:55:53.451 --> 00:55:56.487
- (laughs) I'm glad
you didn't agree.

1012
00:55:57.822 --> 00:55:59.189
- You know. there's
something I've been thinking

1013
00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:02.192
about a lot.
particularly last night.

1014
00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:03.027
- What?

1015
00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:06.296
- Why don't we open
our own agency?

1016
00:56:09.834 --> 00:56:10.835
Why the hell not?

1017
00:56:10.835 --> 00:56:12.503
I've saved up a lot of money.

1018
00:56:12.503 --> 00:56:14.171
and I have excellent credit.

1019
00:56:15.339 --> 00:56:16.507
What?

1020
00:56:16.507 --> 00:56:20.377
- Nothing. I'm.
wow. you're willing

1021
00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:21.812
to risk all your savings.

1022
00:56:24.348 --> 00:56:25.683
- If you'll be my partner.

1023
00:56:28.352 --> 00:56:29.854
- What's your plan.

1024
00:56:29.854 --> 00:56:32.389
- We'll probably get some
concessions on the rent.

1025
00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:33.891
We'll charge half commission

1026
00:56:33.891 --> 00:56:35.893
and this way we'll
attract good agents.

1027
00:56:35.893 --> 00:56:37.828
and the tenants
will be better off.

1028
00:56:39.864 --> 00:56:42.900
And all we need are some
desks. and some telephones.

1029
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:46.370
and some money to run some
ads. and we'll be in business.

1030
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:48.172
- You're something else.

1031
00:56:48.205 --> 00:56:49.707
Can you get listings?

1032
00:56:50.207 --> 00:56:51.041
- Yes.

1033
00:56:52.543 --> 00:56:53.544
- I have an idea.

1034
00:56:54.912 --> 00:56:57.381
Let's get the three agents
you used to work with.

1035
00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:01.919
Offer each one of them
15% of the company.

1036
00:57:01.919 --> 00:57:04.221
We'll keep control with 55%.

1037
00:57:04.221 --> 00:57:05.890
How about that?

1038
00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:08.593
- (chuckles) That'll give
Curtis a heart attack.

1039
00:57:08.593 --> 00:57:10.094
- Yep.

1040
00:57:10.094 --> 00:57:11.729
- Can this really happen?

1041
00:57:11.729 --> 00:57:12.897
- You can make it happen.

1042
00:57:16.734 --> 00:57:18.402
- Let's celebrate. tonight.

1043
00:57:18.402 --> 00:57:20.104
It'll be on me.

1044
00:57:20.104 --> 00:57:21.105
- Sounds good to me.

1045
00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:24.942
(claps) Cameriere.
champagne. lobster.

1046
00:57:24.942 --> 00:57:26.410
and (speaks in
foreign language)!

1047
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:27.411
It's on her.

1048
00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:35.285
* When we two were near
I knew... *

1049
00:57:35.419 --> 00:57:36.754
- What's this?

1050
00:57:36.754 --> 00:57:38.923
- I'm not much of a drinker.

1051
00:57:38.923 --> 00:57:41.425
I'll probably be drunk
with the first three sips.

1052
00:57:41.425 --> 00:57:42.893
- That's good.

1053
00:57:42.893 --> 00:57:44.461
Salute.

1054
00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:47.264
(glasses clinks)

1055
00:57:49.133 --> 00:57:50.300
- This is delicious.

1056
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.936
What is this?
- Whiskey sour.

1057
00:57:55.139 --> 00:57:57.107
- I never knew a
drink tastes so good.

1058
00:57:57.107 --> 00:57:57.942
I love it.

1059
00:57:57.942 --> 00:57:58.943
- Keep drinking it.

1060
00:57:58.943 --> 00:58:00.578
- This is so exciting.

1061
00:58:00.578 --> 00:58:02.780
What are we gonna
call our business?

1062
00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:04.649
- I don't know.

1063
00:58:04.649 --> 00:58:06.250
- Reno and Mancini limited.

1064
00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.953
- Mancini and Reno. I'm the
one financing the company.

1065
00:58:08.953 --> 00:58:11.088
- Okay. Mancini and Reno it is.

1066
00:58:12.823 --> 00:58:15.793
(glasses clinking)

1067
00:58:18.796 --> 00:58:20.965
- You know. I really
appreciate the fact

1068
00:58:20.965 --> 00:58:23.133
that you're making me a partner.

1069
00:58:23.133 --> 00:58:23.968
Thank you.

1070
00:58:26.637 --> 00:58:27.471
Wanna dance?

1071
00:58:28.639 --> 00:58:35.279
* When we two were near

1072
00:58:35.479 --> 00:58:41.786
* I knew my love was here

1073
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:49.827
* But his words were
sweet and kind *

1074
00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:57.534
* And his love gave
peace of mind *

1075
00:58:58.669 --> 00:59:04.541
* And the way he
kissed and cared *

1076
00:59:04.975 --> 00:59:13.317
* I believed every
word he said *

1077
00:59:14.018 --> 00:59:16.520
(ambient music)

1078
00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:17.722
What?

1079
00:59:17.722 --> 00:59:19.189
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

1080
00:59:19.189 --> 00:59:20.490
- I think you're drunk.

1081
00:59:22.226 --> 00:59:24.161
- Diane. I never
met anyone like you.

1082
00:59:26.163 --> 00:59:27.898
This is a change for me.

1083
00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:29.199
a great. wonderful change.

1084
00:59:41.846 --> 00:59:43.380
- I can't. I can't.

1085
00:59:44.715 --> 00:59:45.716
I'm sorry.

1086
00:59:45.716 --> 00:59:46.550
- Why can't you?

1087
00:59:51.055 --> 00:59:53.557
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1088
00:59:55.726 --> 00:59:56.894
- I wish you'd tell me.

1089
00:59:57.728 --> 00:59:59.596
You can trust me just tell me.

1090
01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.701
(Diane sighs)

1091
01:00:03.701 --> 01:00:09.073
- All right. well. after. you
know. I found out David died.

1092
01:00:09.573 --> 01:00:11.776
I just can't explain it.

1093
01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:13.243
I just felt numb.

1094
01:00:14.745 --> 01:00:18.749
And I wanted to know if he
said anything before he died.

1095
01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:22.419
So I made like dozens of calls.

1096
01:00:22.419 --> 01:00:24.588
and finally I found someone
who said he was there

1097
01:00:24.588 --> 01:00:25.422
when he got shot.

1098
01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:29.626
(suspense music)

1099
01:00:50.781 --> 01:00:51.615
- Come on in.

1100
01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:56.286
- So what happened?

1101
01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:04.628
- Something terrible
I can't talk about it.

1102
01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.632
- What happened to that guy?

1103
01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.302
- Well. he got off scot-free.

1104
01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:15.139
and it turned out
he wasn't even there

1105
01:01:15.139 --> 01:01:17.507
when David died.

1106
01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:20.110
He'd been kicked out for drugs.

1107
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:23.613
and then I found out
he overdosed and died.

1108
01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:27.651
I still. I really
hate talking about it.

1109
01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:29.319
- I'm very sorry.

1110
01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.127
It's okay.

1111
01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:38.162
Come.

1112
01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:42.632
It's okay. it's okay.

1113
01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:58.015
(jolly music)

1114
01:01:58.015 --> 01:02:00.851
(people chattering)

1115
01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:10.861
- Do you know how much
money we've netted so far?

1116
01:02:10.861 --> 01:02:11.829
- How much?

1117
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:14.064
- Over $12.000.
- $12.000?

1118
01:02:14.865 --> 01:02:17.034
- Yeah. our business has
been doubling every day.

1119
01:02:17.534 --> 01:02:19.203
- Well. if that
up we'll be richer

1120
01:02:19.203 --> 01:02:20.871
than a Rockefeller in a month.

1121
01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:22.239
(Diane laughs)

1122
01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:23.240
Don't laugh.

1123
01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:26.210
Let me ask you something.

1124
01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:29.013
What if you only had one penny.

1125
01:02:29.013 --> 01:02:32.182
and you double that penny
each day for 40 days?

1126
01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:37.187
What if I told you he would
come to over 10 billion.

1127
01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:39.589
but not 10 billion
pennies. $10 billion.

1128
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.759
- Get outta here.
- I'm telling the truth.

1129
01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.196
Incidentally. what
do your parents think

1130
01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:47.431
about your business?

1131
01:02:49.399 --> 01:02:52.903
- They would go crazy if they
knew I invested everything.

1132
01:02:52.903 --> 01:02:55.705
especially with you. (laughs)

1133
01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.875
- Just keep assuring
them I'll be gone soon.

1134
01:02:59.743 --> 01:03:02.246
- (sighs) I really don't
like thinking about that.

1135
01:03:03.914 --> 01:03:06.416
(ambient music)

1136
01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:08.919
What if we opened up a
branch in California?

1137
01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:11.788
- What about the business
you just open here?

1138
01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:15.592
- That's a diplomatic answer.

1139
01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.595
It's not exactly the
one I wanted to hear.

1140
01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:29.306
(dogs barking)

1141
01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:31.775
- Hey. little puppy.

1142
01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:34.444
Hey puppy. puppy. puppy.

1143
01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:35.412
(dog growls)

1144
01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:36.780
(Claude laughs)

1145
01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.815
- Wait right here I'm gonna
be back in one minute.

1146
01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.450
- Okay. I won't move.

1147
01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:42.786
(dog barks)

1148
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.324
(phone dials)

1149
01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.295
- Lawrence. it's Ferro.

1150
01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:53.097
- I'm sorry to be the
bearer of bad news

1151
01:03:53.097 --> 01:03:55.665
but Dunbar has made a
serious move to take control

1152
01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:57.467
of Olivetti Enterprises.

1153
01:03:57.467 --> 01:04:00.304
He made a tender
offer of $65 a share.

1154
01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:04.474
- Okay. counter it
with $70 a share

1155
01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:06.310
and knock the son
of a bitch out.

1156
01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:07.644
- [Lawrence] If
it's not too late.

1157
01:04:07.644 --> 01:04:09.279
The judge was very angry
when you didn't show

1158
01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:10.280
up the last time.

1159
01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.149
- The same judge?
- Yes.

1160
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:14.018
Jesus Ferro. it
comes down to this.

1161
01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:16.320
if you show up you win.

1162
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.990
If not. you lose control of
Ferro Olivetti Enterprises.

1163
01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.328
- Hey. I gotta call you back.

1164
01:04:24.328 --> 01:04:26.830
(phone beeps)

1165
01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:30.034
- Where are my anti-acids?

1166
01:04:30.034 --> 01:04:31.668
- You got off the phone quickly.

1167
01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:34.504
- A gift?

1168
01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:37.674
- It's a little
memento from New York.

1169
01:04:37.674 --> 01:04:39.476
- (laughs) Thank you.

1170
01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:50.187
(jets revving)

1171
01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:59.196
(people cheering)

1172
01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:02.699
That's so close. it's
incredible!

1173
01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:05.402
(jets soaring)

1174
01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:09.073
(crowd cheers and applauds)

1175
01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:23.087
- I can't stand thinking
about you leaving.

1176
01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:29.026
- If you know all about me
you wouldn't want me to stay.

1177
01:05:29.726 --> 01:05:31.895
- I know you better
than you think I do.

1178
01:05:35.232 --> 01:05:37.101
I love you. Claude.

1179
01:05:44.074 --> 01:05:46.576
(jets soaring)

1180
01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:55.419
- Your client has been
very elusive thus far.

1181
01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:57.921
I expect I'm here
9:00 AM Monday.

1182
01:05:57.921 --> 01:05:59.256
- This Monday?
- Yes.

1183
01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:03.760
- Would your honor consider
next Monday? (chuckles)

1184
01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.095
- Well. maybe you
didn't hear me.

1185
01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:06.763
I said this Monday.

1186
01:06:06.763 --> 01:06:07.597
(gavel drops)

1187
01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:08.598
Next case.

1188
01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:13.903
- How did it go?

1189
01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:15.305
- Judge Franklin wants
to see you in court

1190
01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:16.606
on Monday at 9:00 AM.

1191
01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:19.909
- Is there any way
we can postpone it?

1192
01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:21.611
- No. we tried.

1193
01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:23.647
I told you. you show up you win.

1194
01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:26.950
you don't show up you lose
control of your company.

1195
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:30.287
- Then I guess you have to
take Claude as me to court.

1196
01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:31.955
- What? That's crazy.

1197
01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:34.291
That's too dangerous.

1198
01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:36.093
We could wind up in jail.

1199
01:06:36.093 --> 01:06:38.095
- Just make sure you
do all the talking.

1200
01:06:39.463 --> 01:06:42.266
(Lawrence sighs)

1201
01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:45.001
Listen. I gotta go.

1202
01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:45.969
I'll call you back.

1203
01:06:51.975 --> 01:06:54.478
(phone rings)

1204
01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:56.613
- Hello.

1205
01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:58.182
- Lawrence. I think your
home phone is bugged.

1206
01:06:58.182 --> 01:07:00.817
Do not use your home
phone use your cell phone.

1207
01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:01.651
Okay?

1208
01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:07.357
Hey. can I talk to you later?

1209
01:07:08.992 --> 01:07:11.328
- Yeah. I can take a hint.

1210
01:07:18.668 --> 01:07:19.836
(phone rings)

1211
01:07:19.836 --> 01:07:21.138
- Yeah.

1212
01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:23.840
- You were right. the
bastards bugged my phone.

1213
01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.209
- [Ferro] You sure?

1214
01:07:25.209 --> 01:07:26.343
- Yeah. I'm holding it.

1215
01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.813
- Okay. send the plane
to LaGuardia at 2 AM.

1216
01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:33.016
- Now you're talking.

1217
01:07:33.016 --> 01:07:35.152
They're gonna think
it's not you in court.

1218
01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:39.356
(phone beeps)

1219
01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.496
- Chair is still empty.

1220
01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:47.997
Where's your client?

1221
01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:50.700
- Ah. your honor. my client has.

1222
01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.203
he's been unavoidably detained.

1223
01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:55.872
- I'm afraid we can't
wait any longer.

1224
01:07:55.872 --> 01:07:58.041
I'm sorry. counselor. by
the absence of your client

1225
01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:59.343
I have no choice but to decide

1226
01:07:59.343 --> 01:08:00.877
for Mr. Dunbar by default.

1227
01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:02.879
- Your honor. please.

1228
01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:12.589
- Your honor we believe
that the person standing

1229
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.224
before you is an imposter.

1230
01:08:14.224 --> 01:08:16.059
and not Mr. Olivetti.

1231
01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:17.861
- This is a very
serious accusation.

1232
01:08:20.063 --> 01:08:21.398
Are you Ferro Olivetti?

1233
01:08:21.398 --> 01:08:23.066
- Yes. your honor.

1234
01:08:23.066 --> 01:08:24.568
- [Franklin] You have
proof of identity?

1235
01:08:24.568 --> 01:08:25.735
- Of course. your honor.

1236
01:08:25.735 --> 01:08:26.603
- Bailiff?

1237
01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:40.417
Show this to Mr. Dunbar's
attorney. please.

1238
01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:41.251
Thank you.

1239
01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.431
- We apologize. your honor.

1240
01:08:54.431 --> 01:08:57.234
- You should save your
apology for Mr. Olivetti.

1241
01:08:57.234 --> 01:08:59.102
Well. it's been quite
a morning counselor.

1242
01:08:59.102 --> 01:09:00.237
but things are looking up.

1243
01:09:00.237 --> 01:09:02.606
Congratulations. case dismissed.

1244
01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:04.140
(gravel drops)

1245
01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.810
(ominous music)

1246
01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:15.585
(plane engine roaring)

1247
01:09:18.288 --> 01:09:20.290
- Both of these are in this-

1248
01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:21.491
Oh. excuse me.

1249
01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:24.428
- Hey.

1250
01:09:24.428 --> 01:09:25.829
- Where have you been all day?

1251
01:09:27.464 --> 01:09:28.965
- I can't tell you.

1252
01:09:28.965 --> 01:09:30.934
- I'm sick of all these secrets.

1253
01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:33.637
- Just trust me. please.

1254
01:09:33.637 --> 01:09:34.471
Okay?

1255
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:40.510
- Sorry about that.

1256
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:44.314
So yes. this one is
literally two blocks.

1257
01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:46.015
and you can look at
the outside of it.

1258
01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:48.184
and then one more block.

1259
01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:49.986
Yeah. so look at
them and call me.

1260
01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:53.156
and let me know if
you like this one.

1261
01:09:53.156 --> 01:09:54.157
- Yeah.

1262
01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:57.160
- So. you know. a
couple blocks from here.

1263
01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.662
- You may as well.

1264
01:09:58.662 --> 01:10:00.029
- Yeah. just two down.

1265
01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:04.167
- What are you doing here?
- Hi baby.

1266
01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:05.969

(whispering indistinctly)

1267
01:10:06.002 --> 01:10:08.037
- No. no. no. no.
- What's the matter?

1268
01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.172
What is the matter?
- No.

1269
01:10:09.172 --> 01:10:10.640
- What is the matter?
- No. no. no.

1270
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.176
- What is--
- Diane. wait.

1271
01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:17.547
Diane wait. wait.

1272
01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:23.019
Diane wait.

1273
01:10:23.019 --> 01:10:24.388
Let me explain.
- I hate you.

1274
01:10:24.388 --> 01:10:26.556
- Wait. wait.
- I hate you.

1275
01:10:28.525 --> 01:10:31.027
(truck honks)

1276
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:36.366
(somber music)

1277
01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:51.047
(phone rings)

1278
01:10:51.047 --> 01:10:52.215
- Hello.

1279
01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:54.384
- Mrs. Mancini. this is Fer...

1280
01:10:54.384 --> 01:10:55.552
This is Claude.

1281
01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:56.720
Is Diane home?

1282
01:10:59.689 --> 01:11:00.857
- Ooh. God.

1283
01:11:00.857 --> 01:11:03.059
- (chuckles) Who was that?

1284
01:11:03.059 --> 01:11:04.227
- Oh. it's just a--
- Are you all right?

1285
01:11:04.227 --> 01:11:07.364
- No. it was just an
irritating sales pitch.

1286
01:11:07.364 --> 01:11:08.598
That's what it was.

1287
01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:14.203
- Hi. Mrs Mancini.
it's me again.

1288
01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:15.238
Maybe we've got dis--

1289
01:11:23.413 --> 01:11:26.082
(suspense music)

1290
01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:32.255
(people chattering)

1291
01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:45.935
(phone rings)

1292
01:11:45.935 --> 01:11:47.236
- Hello?
- Hello. Mrs. Mancini

1293
01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:49.072
please don't hang up.

1294
01:11:49.072 --> 01:11:50.607
Don't hang up. please.

1295
01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:53.242
Listen. there's been a big
misunderstanding with Diane.

1296
01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:54.644
I need to speak to her.

1297
01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:56.446
It's very important.

1298
01:11:56.446 --> 01:11:57.947
I'm going back to
California.

1299
01:11:57.947 --> 01:12:01.284
- Now look. Mr. Reno. how
many times must you be told

1300
01:12:01.284 --> 01:12:03.753
that my daughter does
not wanna talk to you.

1301
01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:06.956
hear from you. or
see you ever again?

1302
01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:09.493
So please. will you
stop harassing us?

1303
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.634
- Did anyone call?

1304
01:12:17.634 --> 01:12:18.935
- Oh no.

1305
01:12:18.935 --> 01:12:20.470
That was Stanley
from Poughkeepsie.

1306
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:22.472
I've asked him to help
us with our taxes.

1307
01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:31.648
(ambient music)

1308
01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:39.789
- Hey.

1309
01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:47.130
- He's gone for good. isn't he?

1310
01:12:52.502 --> 01:12:54.370
- He asked me to say goodbye.

1311
01:12:57.173 --> 01:12:58.341
- Did he leave a number?

1312
01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:02.546
- No.

1313
01:13:05.549 --> 01:13:08.217
(ambient music)

1314
01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:15.492
- Yeah?

1315
01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.861
- Sorry to bother you do
you remember Claude Reno

1316
01:13:17.861 --> 01:13:19.062
who worked for you?

1317
01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:20.196
- What happened to him?

1318
01:13:21.531 --> 01:13:22.532
- Look at this.

1319
01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:26.903
- I just got this $50.000 check

1320
01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:28.337
from him in this letter.

1321
01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:30.039
but he signed it Ferro Olivetti.

1322
01:13:30.039 --> 01:13:32.008
- He said he worked for him.

1323
01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:33.510
- The billionaire?
- Yeah.

1324
01:13:35.211 --> 01:13:36.345
- I miss him terribly.

1325
01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:39.549
- Me too.

1326
01:13:39.549 --> 01:13:41.050
It's very lonely
without him.

1327
01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:43.920
- His last wish taught me a lot.

1328
01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.054
He was very wise.

1329
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:47.390
- I know.

1330
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:49.893
- And to top it
all I met someone.

1331
01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:54.263
Someone so different from
anyone I ever met before.

1332
01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:56.399
- Is she with you?

1333
01:13:56.399 --> 01:13:58.535
- [Ferro] I think I lost her.

1334
01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:00.770
- I have never known
you to be a quitter.

1335
01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:02.939
Go to her.

1336
01:14:04.207 --> 01:14:05.208
- Okay.

1337
01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:08.912
(car engine revs)

1338
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:16.419
(ambient music)

1339
01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:25.795
(Ferro knocks)

1340
01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:32.602
- Now. how do you say
get lost in Italian?

1341
01:14:32.602 --> 01:14:35.572
- Mrs. Mancini. please. I need
to speak to Diane. please.

1342
01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:37.974
- Diane.
- My God. Claude.

1343
01:14:39.442 --> 01:14:40.910
Why didn't you call me?

1344
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:42.111
I did.

1345
01:14:42.111 --> 01:14:44.614
I did call you many times.

1346
01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:46.783
Diane. I need to
speak to you. please.

1347
01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:01.130
(door shuts)

1348
01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:03.800
(ambient music)

1349
01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:48.978
- When are you leaving?

1350
01:15:49.012 --> 01:15:50.013
- Today.

1351
01:15:54.017 --> 01:15:56.185
- Can I visit you in
California sometime?

1352
01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:01.691
- I have an idea.

1353
01:16:02.692 --> 01:16:03.693
- What?

1354
01:16:03.693 --> 01:16:04.661
- Come with me.

1355
01:16:06.362 --> 01:16:09.065
- Oh my God. I can't
believe you just said that.

1356
01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:14.570
- (laughs) I hate to see
your parents expression

1357
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:17.206
when you tell them. (laughs)

1358
01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:24.080
- I know how I feel.

1359
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.849
I just wanna be near you.

1360
01:16:25.849 --> 01:16:28.517
(ambient music)

1361
01:16:39.562 --> 01:16:41.397
- What about the business?

1362
01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:44.233
- Just. let's give our
shares to our agents.

1363
01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:47.704
- That's why you
can't save any money.

1364
01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:49.906
Anything you don't spend
you're giving away.

1365
01:17:01.785 --> 01:17:04.253
(door opens)

1366
01:17:05.588 --> 01:17:08.457
- You should think
about it more carefully.

1367
01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:09.759
- Why don't you go next week?

1368
01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:10.894
- Next week!

1369
01:17:12.428 --> 01:17:15.464
- What if he asks you?

1370
01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.233
- Asks me what?

1371
01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:18.467
- To marry him?

1372
01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.069
- Oh. don't worry mom.

1373
01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:21.470
He's a free spirit.

1374
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:24.073
He has no intentions of
being held down by marriage.

1375
01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:24.941
- Oh. well I.

1376
01:17:30.279 --> 01:17:33.082
(suspense music)

1377
01:17:34.818 --> 01:17:37.320
(Taxi starts)

1378
01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:55.972
- Don't forget your
promise. no more secrets.

1379
01:17:55.972 --> 01:17:57.140
- Okay.

1380
01:18:00.643 --> 01:18:01.845
Anything to drink?

1381
01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:06.649
- A dry martini
and a whiskey sour.

1382
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:07.817
- Thank you.

1383
01:18:15.959 --> 01:18:16.960
- Bye.

1384
01:18:20.163 --> 01:18:21.630
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1385
01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:26.702
- Good afternoon. Mr. Olivetti.

1386
01:18:26.803 --> 01:18:28.204
- Good to see you. Claude.

1387
01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:31.841
Diane Mancini. Claude Reno.

1388
01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:32.675
- Madam.

1389
01:18:40.683 --> 01:18:41.985
- How do you do?

1390
01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:50.860
(door shuts)

1391
01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.229
- I'm Ferro Olivetti.

1392
01:18:56.032 --> 01:18:58.501
- You mean the Ferro Olivetti--
- Yes. yes.

1393
01:18:59.368 --> 01:19:00.837
- You're crazy.

1394
01:19:01.905 --> 01:19:04.373
Oh my God. Claude.
- Ferro.

1395
01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:09.012
- What in the world
are you talking about?

1396
01:19:09.012 --> 01:19:10.546
Why didn't you tell me?

1397
01:19:10.546 --> 01:19:12.215
What the hell were
you doing in New York?

1398
01:19:12.215 --> 01:19:13.182
- I'm sorry.

1399
01:19:16.886 --> 01:19:18.888
When we met I told you
it was a long story.

1400
01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:21.090
I wish I could explain
it then but

1401
01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:22.091
I couldn't.

1402
01:19:23.359 --> 01:19:24.560
(car engine revs)

1403
01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.395
- It all started with
my father's will.

1404
01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:31.067
(ambient music)

1405
01:19:31.067 --> 01:19:33.602
(water ebbing)

1406
01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:37.907
Hello. Barbara.

1407
01:19:37.907 --> 01:19:38.908
- Hi. how are you?

1408
01:19:38.908 --> 01:19:40.076
- Ah. give me a hug

1409
01:19:41.577 --> 01:19:44.080
Barbara. this is Diane Mancini.

1410
01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.049
- Hi. nice to meet
you. Ms. Diane.

1411
01:19:46.049 --> 01:19:47.917
- This place is amazing.

1412
01:19:50.253 --> 01:19:51.087
- Come.

1413
01:19:51.087 --> 01:19:51.921
- I'll show you around.

1414
01:19:58.094 --> 01:20:01.730
- Oh my God. I
can't believe this.

1415
01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:03.766
(laughs)

1416
01:20:05.969 --> 01:20:07.136
- You like it?

1417
01:20:07.971 --> 01:20:09.072
- Yeah.

1418
01:20:09.072 --> 01:20:12.575
(ambient music continues)

1419
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:22.418
This is all really wonderful.

1420
01:20:22.418 --> 01:20:24.820
but I've just started
thinking about a job.

1421
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:25.754
- I have an idea.

1422
01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:29.926
- What. we open
an agency here?

1423
01:20:29.926 --> 01:20:31.494
- Not exactly.

1424
01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:32.962
Maybe.

1425
01:20:32.962 --> 01:20:34.430
- Then what?

1426
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:35.631
- I'll tell you later.

1427
01:20:35.631 --> 01:20:37.133
- That's not fair.
tell me your idea.

1428
01:20:37.133 --> 01:20:39.635
(Ferro laughs)

1429
01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:43.973
- Before I met you.

1430
01:20:45.141 --> 01:20:47.676
every other day I used to
think I loved another woman.

1431
01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:51.981
Now I know that you're the
only woman I ever loved.

1432
01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.488
- That's the first time
you've ever said that.

1433
01:20:59.488 --> 01:21:00.990
- It's the first
time I meant it.

1434
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:02.491
and you know what?

1435
01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:03.659
- What?

1436
01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:05.161
- In New York you
made me a full partner

1437
01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:06.329
with everything you had.

1438
01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:11.000

in California I'm asking you

1439
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.302
to be my partner with
everything I have.

1440
01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:22.678
- Is that your way of proposing?

1441
01:21:22.678 --> 01:21:24.313
- Yes.

1442
01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:26.015
Will you please marry me?

1443
01:21:26.015 --> 01:21:28.684
(ambient music)

1444
01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:12.561
- You may now kiss the bride.

1445
01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:22.238

and Mrs. Ferro Olivetti.
