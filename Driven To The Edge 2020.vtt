You should worry about me.

'Cause I'm dangerous.

Cool.

You don't seem impressed.

-Am I supposed to be?
-Yeah.

73
00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.826
No app this time.
I just met a guy.

-In real life?
-In the flesh!

75
00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.788
-What?
-Can you believe it?

76
00:07:36.832 --> 00:07:39.499
-How'd you meet him?
-Roller.

77
00:07:39.543 --> 00:07:41.126
You mean. like.
he was another passenger?

78
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.421
-No. He was my driver.
-Really?

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:47.007
Yeah. really. I mean.
w-what's wrong with that?

80
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.383
No. I didn't say
anything was wrong.

I just want you to be safe.

82
00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:51.470
you don't know anything
about this guy.

83
00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:54.222
No. but what's there to know?

84
00:07:54.266 --> 00:07:56.600
Like. I've already put
my whole life in his hands.

85
00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.268
I was in his car.

86
00:07:58.312 --> 00:08:00.395
he had the perfect opportunity
to kill me.

87
00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:01.938
and he didn't.

88
00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:03.857
Wow.

89
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:05.692

-Oh.

98
00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:33.094
Yup. My ride got canceled.

99
00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.222
-Hate it when that happens.
-Oh...

100
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:38.892
-Well. which way are you going?
-Uh. I have a meeting downtown.

101
00:08:38.936 --> 00:08:41.102
I'm headed that way.
Do you want a ride?

Good luck.

You really don't mind?
'Cause I am in kind of a hurry.

-I'll tip you extra.
-Oh. no. no. no. I'll tip him.

-Nice to meet you. Jaye.
-It's nice to meet you.

116
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.482
I'm curious about what kind
of portfolio you got there.

117
00:09:27.526 --> 00:09:30.235
Oh. Any guesses?

118
00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.487
Let me see.

119
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:37.117
Something to do with fashion?

120
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.827
Whoa. I'm impressed.

121
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.453
-I was right?
-Yeah.

122
00:09:41.832 --> 00:09:43.707
-Can I take a look?
-Yeah.

123
00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:51.214
They're beautiful.

124
00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:55.051

who can be so creative.

I sell real estate
for a living. so...

126
00:09:56.972 --> 00:09:58.221
Well. what's wrong with that?

[siren blaring]

128
00:10:06.857 --> 00:10:09.899

know. unpaid parking tickets

murder or something.

130
00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.281
Yeah.

131
00:10:16.325 --> 00:10:18.283
Um. you know what.
I-I actually.

132
00:10:18.327 --> 00:10:21.369
I don't have that far to go.
so I think I'm just gonna walk.

133
00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:24.122
-Oh. me. too.
-Okay.

134
00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:31.713
Doesn't Roller do
background checks?

135
00:10:31.757 --> 00:10:34.466
Supposedly.
but that doesn't stop somebody

136
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:38.303
from impersonating a driver.
like what happened in Boston.

137
00:10:38.347 --> 00:10:40.180
What happened in Boston?

138
00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.349
Somebody pretending to be
a driver killed three people.

139
00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:43.892
-Are you serious?
-Yes!

140
00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.310
Don't you watch Dateline?

141
00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:02.661
[Tess] Um. okay.

142
00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:04.871
Yeah. this is.
this is where my meeting is.

143
00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:09.167
-Knock 'em dead.
-Thank you.

144
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:10.585
Okay. see ya.

Tess?

146
00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:17.092
I know we're a-adults and all.

147
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:19.177
and for some reason
we're not supposed

148
00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:23.390
to randomly make new friends.
but. um...

149
00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.768
would you like to be my friend?

150
00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:31.898
Yeah. sure. Yeah.

[Jaye] Come on.
Don't you remember me?

158
00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:02.614
You know this is the third time
I've picked you up. Tess.

159
00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:07.911
You really should pay attention
once in a while.

160
00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:10.246
I could be
some kind of sick maniac.

161
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.417
[sighs]
But it's not just you.

162
00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:18.004
[Jaye] Everyone is so trusting
nowadays.

163
00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:20.256
Most riders
barely even notice me.

164
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.802
But I notice everything
about them.

165
00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.763
Everyone is so careless
with their secrets.

166
00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:32.268
I feel so close to you.

167
00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.729
even though we barely even
know each other.

168
00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:40.401
But that's all about to change.

169
00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:43.238
I've got a lot
planned for us. Tess.

[Jaye on video] Lights.

182
00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:42.333
[woman] Get out of my h...
[gasps]

183
00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:44.127
[man] Whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. hey.

184
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.545
-Relax. relax!
-[woman screams]

185
00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:47.797
[man] Oh. my God!
Oh. my God!

186
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.260
Help! Oh. my God!

187
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.228
-[thuds]
-[man] Ah!

188
00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:04.647
No! Stop. please! No! Ah...

189
00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:05.857
[cell phone beeps]

190
00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:12.947
Finally.

191
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.800
Jolly Jane.

192
00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:34.552
Jane is jolly.

193
00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:39.849
[birds chirping]

194
00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:58.076
Smile.

195
00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:01.204
Smile big even when
you don't feel like it.

196
00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:04.457
Practice every day.

197
00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.671
Smiling can actually
trick your brain.

198
00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:13.299
The facial muscles you use
when you're smiling

199
00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.468
make you feel happy.

200
00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:17.178
[indistinct whisperings]

201
00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:21.891
It's good for you...
like talking to yourself.

202
00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:25.311
Talking to yourself can make you
a good conversationalist.

203
00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:28.648
Talking to yourself makes you
a better conversationalist.

204
00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:30.066
[indistinct whisperings]

205
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.484
And it keeps you company.

206
00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:35.488
Not to mention.
it can keep you company.

207
00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:38.658
Just remember. you're only crazy
if somebody talks back to you.

208
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:40.785
...someone talking back to you.

209
00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:44.205
Jolly Jane. Jane. Jane.
Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane.

210
00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:45.373
Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane.

211
00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:46.916
Jolly Jane.

212
00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:56.342
[dramatic music]

213
00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:06.769
Oh. man. I have not done this
in forever.

214
00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:09.605
-When was the last time?
-Geez. not since I was a kid.

215
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.482
I mean. I played
in middle school. but I kinda

216
00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:15.486
lost interest in high school.
and now I kind of suck.

217
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.989
-What was your position?
-Pitcher.

218
00:19:18.032 --> 00:19:22.118
-Ah. I was a catcher.
-Wow. You are braver than me.

219
00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:24.078
Being a catcher
always scared me.

220
00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:26.706
Girls sliding into home.
their cleats out.

221
00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:28.374
It must've been pretty tough.

222
00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:31.752
Yeah. well.
my dad kinda made me do it.

223
00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:34.046
He was all about being tough.

224
00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.258
[chuckles] My dad
was the complete opposite.

225
00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:39.552
[Jaye] Oh. yeah? Not so tough?

226
00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.721
No. uh...

227
00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:45.391
Well. my parents adopted me when
I was really little. you know.

228
00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:47.977
and they were older.
so I think they thought

229
00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:51.439
they missed their chance
to have kids or something. so...

230
00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:53.274
They took it pretty easy on me.

231
00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:57.570
So where are they now?

232
00:19:57.614 --> 00:20:00.781
Uh. they passed away. actually.

233
00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:04.869
-I'm sorry.
-[Tess] Yeah.

234
00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:06.329
Mine. too.

235
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.042
-[Tess] Really?
-Yeah.

236
00:20:11.085 --> 00:20:13.628
It's kind of weird not having
parents anymore. right?

237
00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:18.007
Yeah. Like you don't have roots.

238
00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:22.887
I get really lonely if I think
about it too much. you know?

239
00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:26.224
Most people
just don't understand.

240
00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:28.976
I do.

241
00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.864
[dramatic music]

242
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.616
Hey.

243
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.160
-You're up.
-Cool.

244
00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:48.663
Wow. This thing looks
well loved.

245
00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:50.581
Yeah. My dad gave it to me.

246
00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.750
Always reminds me of him.

247
00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:56.295
So you took a Roller here.
Do you not drive?

248
00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:58.005
-I'm between vehicles.
-Oh.

249
00:20:58.049 --> 00:20:59.548
[chuckles]
No. uh...

250
00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:02.677
I'm actually in no rush
to get a new car.

251
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.220
I used to be so against
ride-share apps.

252
00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:05.596
How come?

253
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.600
Ugh. it's a long boring story.

254
00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.686
But I guess I've seen the light.
you know?

255
00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:14.313
No car payments. no maintenance.

256
00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:17.275
no parking. no insurance.

257
00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:19.402
-Works for me.
-Yeah. makes sense.

258
00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:21.612
-Okay.
-Okay. Let's do this.

259
00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:26.033
Yeah! You're good...

260
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:30.454
-[Olive on phone] Softball?
-Yes.

261
00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.790
-Are you jealous?
-Um. of course I'm jealous.

262
00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:34.875
We've never done
anything athletic together.

263
00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:37.128
Okay. well. then let's start.

264
00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:39.922
How about racquetball?

265
00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:41.716
[Olive] How about drinks.
instead?

266
00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:43.592
[chuckles]
Yeah. okay. sure.

267
00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.594
I really want you
to meet Isaac.

268
00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.888
-The Roller driver?
-Mm-hmm.

269
00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:50.433
And invite your new friend if
you want. I wanna size her up.

270
00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:01.193
I think you'll like her.

271
00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:11.662
For Steve?

272
00:22:13.207 --> 00:22:14.915
Yes. For Steve.

273
00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:17.877
Okay. Thank you.

274
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:24.800

277
00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:17.978
What the hell? Give me my phone.

278
00:23:18.022 --> 00:23:20.231
I said. give me my phone.

279
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.653
Stop it. This isn't funny.

280
00:23:28.866 --> 00:23:31.826
[music continues]

281
00:23:37.208 --> 00:23:38.958
Slow down.

282
00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:41.877
Why'd you get into my car.
Steve?

283
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:44.171
I don't even have the app open.

284
00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:46.507
I actually had
other plans tonight.

285
00:23:46.551 --> 00:23:50.594
but you just assumed that I was
your driver. and here we are.

286
00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:53.722
Pretty careless.
don't you think?

287
00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:56.142
I mean. come on.
whatever comes next.

288
00:23:56.185 --> 00:23:58.477
it's got to be your fault.
isn't it?

289
00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:02.064
And now you're pondering
what your next move is.

290
00:24:02.108 --> 00:24:04.358
Do you attack me?

291
00:24:04.402 --> 00:24:06.902
Maybe you could take me.

292
00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:09.071
I mean. I'm just a girl. right?

293
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:13.117
But I seem unpredictable.

294
00:24:14.412 --> 00:24:16.328
You know what I think you'll do?

295
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.664
Nothing.

296
00:24:20.376 --> 00:24:22.168
That's what they all do.

297
00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:24.044
Because even now
you truly believe

298
00:24:24.088 --> 00:24:25.880
that I'm gonna let you go.

299
00:24:28.217 --> 00:24:31.218
[dramatic music]

300
00:24:34.432 --> 00:24:35.681
Please...

301
00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:40.227
Let me go.

302
00:24:40.271 --> 00:24:43.105
I. I can give you money.

303
00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:47.109
I-I won't. I won't tell anyone.

304
00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:51.447
[Jaye on video] Oh. yes?

305
00:24:51.491 --> 00:24:54.450

-Olive! Hi.
-Exac... Tess!

309
00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:52.216
-Hey. hi. Mwah.
-Mwah.

310
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.301
-Tess. this is Isaac.
-Hi. Isaac.

311
00:25:54.345 --> 00:25:55.594
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

312
00:25:55.638 --> 00:25:56.971
I've heard a lot about you.

313
00:25:57.014 --> 00:25:58.597
Oh? Good things. I hope?

314
00:25:58.641 --> 00:26:00.224
-Uh. no.
-Hey!

315
00:26:00.268 --> 00:26:02.685
-Hey. guys.
-Guys. this is my friend Jaye.

316
00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:05.521
Hi. Oh. my gosh.
thank you so much for coming.

317
00:26:05.565 --> 00:26:08.107
-Oh. yeah. thanks.
-Hi. I'm. I'm Isaac.

318
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.234
Hi. nice to meet you. Isaac.

319
00:26:10.278 --> 00:26:13.112
-Have we met before?
-No. I don't think so.

320
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:16.282
Hey. you look familiar. Have
I seen you around somewhere?

321
00:26:16.325 --> 00:26:18.325
Maybe you just gave her a ride
or something.

322
00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:20.619
-Oh. you're on Roller?
-Yeah. I just got out of one.

323
00:26:20.663 --> 00:26:22.788
-Oh. nice.
-Smelled kinda funky. actually.

324
00:26:22.832 --> 00:26:24.164
-Yikes.
-No.

325
00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:26.333
See. they always
blame the driver.

326
00:26:26.377 --> 00:26:29.336
but most times it was. like.
the last rider's fault.

327
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.505
Okay. so then the cops
pull us over

328
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:33.465
and they arrest our driver.

329
00:26:33.509 --> 00:26:34.717
-What for?
-We don't know.

330
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.552
They wouldn't tell us anything.

331
00:26:36.596 --> 00:26:38.387
What about you two.
how did you meet?

332
00:26:38.431 --> 00:26:41.557
-Yup.
-Uh. we also met through Roller.

333
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:44.810
-Oh. yeah?
-Yeah. I. I picked her up.

334
00:26:44.854 --> 00:26:46.895
And then I picked her up.

335
00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:49.690
Why. you make it sound
so sleazy. It was really cute.

336
00:26:49.734 --> 00:26:51.900
It was so cute.
so I'm talking a lot

337
00:26:51.944 --> 00:26:53.777
like my mouth is running.

338
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:58.115
and. uh. I'm checking her out
in the rearview mirror.

339
00:26:58.159 --> 00:27:01.035
and then she was like.
"Oh. my God! Look out!"

340
00:27:01.078 --> 00:27:03.954
'cause I almost rear-ended
the guy in front of me.

341
00:27:03.998 --> 00:27:06.498
Because he was
so enamored by me. right?

342
00:27:06.542 --> 00:27:08.959
-Still am.
-Hm.

343
00:27:09.003 --> 00:27:11.128
It's crazy how much trust
we put into strangers

344
00:27:11.172 --> 00:27:12.755
these days. isn't it?

345
00:27:14.467 --> 00:27:16.508
I mean. she didn't know you.

346
00:27:16.552 --> 00:27:18.385
You could have been anybody.

347
00:27:18.429 --> 00:27:22.765
And she just got in your car
alone. defenseless.

348
00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:25.184
I mean.
anything could have happened.

349
00:27:27.021 --> 00:27:30.272
Whoo. you took that
in a dark direction.

350
00:27:30.316 --> 00:27:32.191
But you used to say
the same thing.

351
00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:34.234
But I mean. it makes sense
'cause with everything

352
00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:36.195
that you went through
and stuff...

353
00:27:36.238 --> 00:27:40.282
-Hm.
-What does she mean?

354
00:27:40.326 --> 00:27:44.078
I had my identity stolen
a couple of years ago.

355
00:27:44.121 --> 00:27:48.791
And it was really. uh. invasive.

356
00:27:48.834 --> 00:27:50.250
And the person who was doing it
would send me

357
00:27:50.294 --> 00:27:52.670
all these weird emails.
like taunting me.

358
00:27:52.713 --> 00:27:54.338
-Oh. ....
-Yeah.

359
00:27:54.382 --> 00:27:56.006
So I didn't really trust anybody
after that.

360
00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.008
I wrote off all apps
and basically all technology

361
00:27:58.052 --> 00:27:59.635
that I didn't absolutely
have to use.

362
00:27:59.679 --> 00:28:01.637
-Wait. w-w-wait. guys.
-What?

363
00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:03.639
I have a brilliant idea. Okay.

364
00:28:03.683 --> 00:28:07.768
So. like. the four of us met
through Roller. right?

365
00:28:07.812 --> 00:28:10.062
What if there was. like.
a-a ride-share app

366
00:28:10.106 --> 00:28:12.773
that was also a dating app?

367
00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:14.358
Yeah. personally I like it.

368
00:28:14.402 --> 00:28:15.734
-[Isaac] Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

369
00:28:15.778 --> 00:28:16.777
Okay. well. you wanna invest?

370
00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:19.029
-Okay.
-[Isaac laughing]

371
00:28:19.073 --> 00:28:20.114
You wanna invest?

372
00:28:20.157 --> 00:28:23.117

[echoing] Jolly Jane.

376
00:29:04.452 --> 00:29:06.118
Jolly Jane.

377
00:29:09.248 --> 00:29:10.873
[upbeat music]

378
00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:13.000
[Isaac] Yo. J!

379
00:29:13.043 --> 00:29:15.127
-OJ?
-No. no. no.

380
00:29:15.171 --> 00:29:18.672
I said. yo. J! You're funny.

381
00:29:18.716 --> 00:29:21.300
Uh. I finally figured it out.

382
00:29:21.343 --> 00:29:24.052
-Figured what out?
-Where I remember you from.

383
00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:27.389
Uh. I was getting
my vehicle inspection for Roller

384
00:29:27.433 --> 00:29:29.141
and you were there
getting one. too.

385
00:29:29.185 --> 00:29:31.393
One what?

386
00:29:31.437 --> 00:29:33.812
Um. a vehicle inspection.

387
00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:37.107
Look. I don't know
why you're trying

388
00:29:37.151 --> 00:29:39.318
to keep this all a secret.

389
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:42.279
You and. you and Tess are
just... You're friends. right?

390
00:29:42.323 --> 00:29:45.199
It's not.
you're not like a couple?

391
00:29:45.242 --> 00:29:46.658
I mean. maybe.
maybe you want her to think

392
00:29:46.702 --> 00:29:47.701
that you're more successful

393
00:29:47.745 --> 00:29:50.579
than you are or something.

394
00:29:50.623 --> 00:29:52.915
I don't know.
but. I. she seems really chill.

395
00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:54.833
I don't.
I don't think she would care.

396
00:29:54.877 --> 00:29:58.962
But I know. it's not my place.

397
00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:01.799
It wasn't me. Isaac.
You're mistaken.

398
00:30:01.842 --> 00:30:04.843
[sighs] Well.
if that is the truth.

399
00:30:04.887 --> 00:30:07.262
uh. then you better look out

400
00:30:07.306 --> 00:30:10.182
'cause. 'cause you got an evil
twin running around out there.

401
00:30:10.226 --> 00:30:12.059
[laughs]

402
00:30:12.102 --> 00:30:14.019
What makes you think
I'm not the evil one?

403
00:30:15.397 --> 00:30:16.647
What. what?

404
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.023
You just assumed
I'm the good one.

405
00:30:18.067 --> 00:30:19.483
But what if I'm the evil twin?

406
00:30:19.527 --> 00:30:21.902
[intense music]

407
00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:27.449

Just call me Jolly Jane.

[dramatic music]

409
00:30:57.523 --> 00:30:59.314
[Isaac] Then you better
look out... [echoing]

410
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:05.195
'cause you got an evil twin
running around out there.

411
00:31:07.241 --> 00:31:08.657
I'm the bad one.
you're the good one.

412
00:31:08.701 --> 00:31:10.617
I'm the bad one.
you're the good one.

413
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:12.536
I'm the bad one.
you're the good one.

414
00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.247
I'm the good one.
you're the bad one.

Livinia.

420
00:32:16.852 --> 00:32:19.061
It's a pretty name. Livinia.

421
00:32:20.564 --> 00:32:21.939
You know.
we're basically neighbors

422
00:32:21.982 --> 00:32:23.899
'cause I. I live
right around the corner.

00:32:58.394 --> 00:32:59.893
Is this the right place?

426
00:32:59.937 --> 00:33:02.479
-Door's stuck.
-Is it?

427
00:33:02.523 --> 00:33:04.815
[Jaye] Yeah. do you have
child locks on?

428
00:33:04.858 --> 00:33:07.442
No. Hold on.

00:33:07.486 --> 00:33:08.860

-Ow! Ow! Ow...

431
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:18.870
[Isaac] Hey. hey. hey. hey.
relax. Wait. Wa-wa-wait.

432
00:33:18.914 --> 00:33:22.165
What? Wait. Jaye?

433
00:33:22.209 --> 00:33:24.001
You know.
I'm pretty hard on most riders.

434
00:33:24.044 --> 00:33:26.378
It's like what we were
talking about last night.

435
00:33:26.422 --> 00:33:29.548
And why do people put their
trust in complete strangers?

436
00:33:29.591 --> 00:33:32.092
I don't trust you. Isaac.
I mean...

437
00:33:32.136 --> 00:33:34.761
-Look at what you're wearing.
-What's wrong with my shirt?

438
00:33:34.805 --> 00:33:37.931
And you definitely
shouldn't trust me.

439
00:33:37.975 --> 00:33:41.560
But it goes both ways. I mean.
most drivers are just as stupid.

440
00:33:41.603 --> 00:33:43.103
We don't know
who's sitting behind us.

441
00:33:43.147 --> 00:33:44.771
We don't know where we're going.

442
00:33:44.815 --> 00:33:46.440
The smart ones.
they have weapons.

443
00:33:46.483 --> 00:33:49.276
-But you don't. do you. Isaac?
-No.

444
00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:53.655
You don't even have a dash cam.
I love my dash cam.

445
00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:55.532
The sunglasses cam
is pretty good. too.

446
00:33:55.576 --> 00:33:57.993
Wait. wait. no. no. no!
Wait. no. no. no!

-Mm.

before I show some houses.

Yeah.

Hey. do you wanna
come over tonight?

462
00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:31.711
Uh. yeah. yeah. sure.
Can I bring anything?

463
00:35:31.755 --> 00:35:33.922
[Jaye] No. I got it covered.

464
00:35:33.966 --> 00:35:36.591

so I gotta go.

465
00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:38.385
I'll text you my address. okay?

I'll talk to you later. Bye.

Bye.

Uh. smells like
disgusting fast food in here.

469
00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:05.704
Did you know Nannie Doss killed
four of her five husbands?

470
00:36:05.747 --> 00:36:08.915
They called her
The Lonely Hearts Killer.

471
00:36:08.959 --> 00:36:11.751
You have any idea why
she didn't kill that fifth guy?

472
00:36:13.922 --> 00:36:16.590
I have my theories.

473
00:36:16.633 --> 00:36:19.342
Aren't we going the wrong way?

474
00:36:19.386 --> 00:36:21.636
I don't know.
I don't know where you're going.

475
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.806
Isn't the address in the app?

476
00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:27.934
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have picked you up.

477
00:36:27.978 --> 00:36:31.730
I'm tired and I. I really don't
have time for this right now.

478
00:36:31.773 --> 00:36:35.317
I just couldn't help myself.
I just had to see.

479
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.612
you know. if you were dumb
enough to get in the car.

480
00:36:38.655 --> 00:36:41.323
like that last one. Steve.

481
00:36:42.951 --> 00:36:46.786
And guess what?
You're just as dumb as Steve.

482
00:36:47.956 --> 00:36:49.456

[Jaye] Help me. somebody!

[knocking on door]

494
00:38:06.702 --> 00:38:07.450
Hello?

495
00:38:13.917 --> 00:38:16.543
-You made it.
-Oh. jeez. you scared me.

496
00:38:16.586 --> 00:38:18.545
[laughs]
Thank you.

497
00:38:18.588 --> 00:38:21.881
-Welcome.
-Uh. this place is insane.

498
00:38:21.925 --> 00:38:23.883
How long have you lived here?

499
00:38:23.927 --> 00:38:25.844
How long have I lived here?

500
00:38:25.887 --> 00:38:28.596
Um. I guess about two years.

501
00:38:29.558 --> 00:38:31.099
Do you have roommates?

502
00:38:32.644 --> 00:38:33.852
I think what you're trying
to ask is

503
00:38:33.895 --> 00:38:36.604
how I can afford to live here.

504
00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:39.357
-Maybe.
-Fair question.

505
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:40.984
I have clients over a lot.

506
00:38:41.028 --> 00:38:44.029
so gotta have a decent place
for. you know...

507
00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:45.405
-Your image?
-Yeah.

508
00:38:45.449 --> 00:38:47.073
A lot of agents rent bus stops.

509
00:38:47.117 --> 00:38:49.534
This is like my bus stop.

510
00:38:49.578 --> 00:38:51.453

Mm.

514
00:38:57.502 --> 00:39:00.211
So what made you
get into fashion?

515
00:39:02.174 --> 00:39:05.175
I think I've always just
felt I need to dress-up.

516
00:39:05.218 --> 00:39:09.471
-Mm.
-And decided to make my own.

517
00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:11.097
Kind of bored
with what was out there.

518
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:13.183
Okay. let's see
what you got here...

519
00:39:13.226 --> 00:39:16.978
That's cute. Oh. you have
a lot of power suits.

520
00:39:17.022 --> 00:39:20.023
- Uh. yuck.
- I like this one.

521
00:39:20.067 --> 00:39:22.442
-Put that on with this guy.
-Oh. Yeah.

522
00:39:22.486 --> 00:39:23.943
-Put this guy. Okay
-Okay.

523
00:39:23.987 --> 00:39:25.362
-Now what about you?
-Me...

524
00:39:25.405 --> 00:39:27.739
Let's see. let's see.

525
00:39:27.783 --> 00:39:30.617
Whoa! What's this?

526
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.160
-Mm-hmm.
-This is amazing.

527
00:39:32.204 --> 00:39:33.745
This is mine. Dibs.
I'm wearing it.

[Jaye laughing]

530
00:39:56.395 --> 00:39:57.685
Oh. man.

531
00:39:59.481 --> 00:40:00.980
You know. I-I have to say.
I think this is

532
00:40:01.024 --> 00:40:02.690
some of the best wine
I've ever had.

533
00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:04.776
You should take a few bottles.
I've got tons.

534
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.903
No. I'm not gonna take
your wine.

535
00:40:06.947 --> 00:40:08.780
If you like something.
you should take it.

536
00:40:08.824 --> 00:40:10.657
That's what I do.

537
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.909
[cell phone beeping]

538
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.746
Oh. Oh! It's Olive.

539
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.540
She keeps trying to talk to me
about Isaac. but honestly.

540
00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:20.250
I really just can't deal with it
right now.

541
00:40:20.293 --> 00:40:24.295
-So just ignore her.
-Yeah. but then I feel guilty.

542
00:40:24.339 --> 00:40:28.049
Hm. that's something
I've never felt before.

543
00:40:28.093 --> 00:40:32.095
-That's hard to believe.
-It's true.

544
00:40:32.139 --> 00:40:35.348
You've never feel guilty
about anything in your life?

545
00:40:35.392 --> 00:40:37.642
What's the point?

546
00:40:37.686 --> 00:40:40.979
I mean. I-I could feel bad
about the slave labor

547
00:40:41.022 --> 00:40:43.064
that goes
into making my cell phone.

548
00:40:43.108 --> 00:40:47.819
But I like my cell phone.
so I-I don't really care.

549
00:40:47.863 --> 00:40:50.113
Do you?

550
00:40:50.157 --> 00:40:53.283
Yeah. I don't love the idea
of slave labor.

551
00:40:53.326 --> 00:40:56.536
Ah. but I mean. we all do it.
Look at us.

552
00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.123
We're sitting here in
the richest country in the world

553
00:41:00.167 --> 00:41:02.250
drinking a bottle of wine
that cost more

554
00:41:02.294 --> 00:41:04.002
than some people make
in a whole month.

555
00:41:04.045 --> 00:41:06.504
I-is it fair? Of course not.

556
00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:08.673
But do I care?

557
00:41:10.385 --> 00:41:11.926
Not even a little bit.

558
00:41:13.054 --> 00:41:14.929
What about you? Do you care?

559
00:41:15.682 --> 00:41:17.640
Yeah. What?

560
00:41:17.684 --> 00:41:20.977
Yeah. of course I care
that things aren't fair.

561
00:41:21.021 --> 00:41:23.813
-Really?
-Yes.

562
00:41:27.819 --> 00:41:30.028

Good.

563
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:33.031

when I drink.

Oh. Whoa.

566
00:41:38.038 --> 00:41:40.747
Olive's calling me. and she
never does that. I'll be back.

-Hey.
-[Olive on phone] Hey. um...

569
00:41:45.504 --> 00:41:47.670
Isaac's been radio silent
all day.

570
00:41:47.714 --> 00:41:49.547
No big deal. right?
Even though he's never played

571
00:41:49.591 --> 00:41:51.382
the I'll-wait-two-days-
to-text-you-back game.

572
00:41:51.426 --> 00:41:53.676
And we're supposed to hang out
tonight. and I still haven't

573
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.678
heard back from him.
so it just kinda makes sense.

574
00:41:55.722 --> 00:41:57.514
-I'm kind of freaking out. r--
-Whoa. slow down.

575
00:41:57.557 --> 00:42:00.308
When's the last time you heard
from him? Like. yesterday?

576
00:42:01.061 --> 00:42:03.102
This morning.

577
00:42:03.146 --> 00:42:05.438
Okay. Olive. you need to relax.

578
00:42:05.482 --> 00:42:07.565
-I'm sure he's fine.
-[Olive] You're sure?

579
00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:09.067
How can you be so sure of that?

580
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:11.778
Just take a deep breath
and try not to worry.

581
00:42:11.821 --> 00:42:14.697
Have I just been moving too fast
with this whole thing?

582
00:42:14.741 --> 00:42:18.910
Um... I. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't think so.

583
00:42:18.954 --> 00:42:21.579
You do think so. otherwise
you'd have just said no.

584
00:42:21.623 --> 00:42:24.249
-Olive.
-You're right. I'm sorry.

585
00:42:24.292 --> 00:42:26.793
What are you doing?

586
00:42:26.836 --> 00:42:30.380
I am at Jaye's house.

587
00:42:31.841 --> 00:42:34.801
Okay. I'll let you go then.

588
00:42:34.844 --> 00:42:36.511
[Tess] Okay. well. let me know
when you hear from him.

589
00:42:36.555 --> 00:42:38.680
and. you know.
just try to stay calm. okay?

590
00:42:38.723 --> 00:42:41.808
Yeah. I'm so calm. Have fun.

591
00:42:41.851 --> 00:42:43.726
[Tess] All right. bye.

-[exhales sharply]
-Is Isaac ghosting her?

593
00:42:46.398 --> 00:42:51.192
Hardly. She hasn't heard
from him since this morning.

594
00:42:51.236 --> 00:42:53.194
And she's. of course.
already assuming the worst.

595
00:42:53.238 --> 00:42:55.697
-That he's dead?
-God. no!

596
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.032
That he's ignoring her.

597
00:42:58.076 --> 00:43:00.743
Which I mean. maybe he is.
She barely knows the dude.

598
00:43:00.787 --> 00:43:02.328
Do you wanna crash here?

599
00:43:02.372 --> 00:43:05.331
We could watch movies.
tell secrets

600
00:43:05.375 --> 00:43:07.458
and. obviously. drink more wine.

601
00:43:07.502 --> 00:43:11.254
Mm. uh. yeah. maybe.

602
00:43:11.298 --> 00:43:14.007

Livinia Fisher.

She was the first female serial
killer in the United States.

This was in the 1800s.

613

Livinia and her husband
ran an inn together.

614
00:44:32.337 --> 00:44:36.297
She would give her guests
cups of poisoned tea.

615
00:44:36.341 --> 00:44:40.677
Most of them just went up
to their room and died.

616

But some of them
who weren't all the way dead.

617

her husband finished them off.

618

that they had a common interest.

some play cards.

to some clients.

00:47:42.527 --> 00:47:46.529
so there's something
I haven't told you.

how Isaac said

that he recognized Jaye?

-Yeah. kinda.
-Okay.

660
00:47:51.369 --> 00:47:53.327
Well. apparently. he saw Jaye

661
00:47:53.371 --> 00:47:56.664
getting a vehicle inspection
for Roller.

662
00:47:56.708 --> 00:47:58.708
An inspection?
Like. to drive for them?

663
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:01.252
-Yeah. Why would you say that?
-I seriously doubt that.

664
00:48:01.296 --> 00:48:03.754
Because you should see
her house. The girl's got money.

665
00:48:03.798 --> 00:48:06.007
Yeah. but. like. she's already
lied to you about her job.

666
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.175
-Right?
-According to her ex-husband.

667
00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:10.219
Maybe he's the one lying.

668
00:48:10.263 --> 00:48:11.846
-Why would he do that?
-I don't know.

669
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:12.972
I don't know
why either one of them

670
00:48:13.016 --> 00:48:14.432
would lie about any of this.

671
00:48:14.475 --> 00:48:17.184
I don't know.
this whole thing's weird.

672
00:48:17.228 --> 00:48:19.937
And also if Jaye's on
social media. I can't find her.

673
00:48:19.981 --> 00:48:22.815
-You checked?
-Yeah. I mean. you?

674
00:48:22.859 --> 00:48:25.401
No. I only do that with guys.

00:48:25.445 --> 00:48:28.237
-Oh. speaking of...
-What?

676
00:48:28.281 --> 00:48:31.324
-Danny's in town.
-Ooh. Ken Doll Danny.

677
00:48:31.367 --> 00:48:33.367
Well. that's not how I have him
saved in my contacts.

678
00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:34.660
but. yes. that Danny.

679
00:48:34.704 --> 00:48:37.580
Are you gonna have sex with him?

680
00:48:37.624 --> 00:48:39.332
Yes. thanks for asking.
I do think

681
00:48:39.375 --> 00:48:40.833
I'm going to have sex with him.

00:49:45.608 --> 00:49:48.401
-Oh. Who?
-Myles.

695
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:51.696
-Oh.
-Yeah.

696
00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:53.990
He said
you don't sell real estate.

697
00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:57.201
[chuckles]
He did?

698
00:49:57.245 --> 00:49:59.203
Have you ever driven
for Roller?

699
00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:03.207
Have you ever driven
for Roller?

700
00:50:03.251 --> 00:50:07.712
Um. no. Why?

701
00:50:07.755 --> 00:50:10.506
Because Isaac told Olive
that you did.

702
00:50:11.467 --> 00:50:14.301
Well. Isaac's wrong.

703
00:50:14.345 --> 00:50:17.013
I don't know. Listen. I have
to get back to work. okay?

704
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:20.808
-Okay.

710
00:51:34.258 --> 00:51:35.591
[Jaye] Hello.

711
00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.139
Hm. How's your cell signal?

712
00:51:42.183 --> 00:51:45.059
-Not good all of a sudden.
-Yeah. imagine that.

713
00:51:46.854 --> 00:51:51.190
-Jaye?
-You caught me.

714
00:51:51.275 --> 00:51:53.692
.... so Isaac was right.

715
00:51:53.736 --> 00:51:55.486
-Who's Myles?
-What?

716
00:51:55.655 --> 00:51:58.572
Tess said she met someone
named Myles.

717
00:51:58.616 --> 00:52:00.658
Like that was supposed to mean
something to me.

718
00:52:00.701 --> 00:52:03.786
Well. yeah.
Isn't he your ex-husband?

719
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:07.331
Oh. Yeah. she was married.
Like Livinia and Nannie.

720
00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:08.916
I should have known that one.

721
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.085
I don't really get it.
Is he your ex or not?

722
00:52:11.129 --> 00:52:13.045
Apparently.

723
00:52:13.089 --> 00:52:16.757
It's not like I do a lot of
research when I choose somebody.

724
00:52:16.801 --> 00:52:19.718
Okay. pull over.
I want to get out. Ahem.

725
00:52:19.762 --> 00:52:21.554
Say hi. You're on camera.

726
00:52:25.935 --> 00:52:28.352
Okay. come on. come on.
I-I said to pull over.

727
00:52:28.396 --> 00:52:30.980
Did you know that Isaac
doesn't have a dash cam?

728
00:52:31.023 --> 00:52:34.608
I mean. can you believe that?
It's the best part of this job.

729
00:52:34.652 --> 00:52:37.778
-How do you know that?
-How do I know what?

730
00:52:37.822 --> 00:52:39.655
[mumbling]
Yeah. I'm calling the police.

731
00:52:39.699 --> 00:52:42.032
You know what's almost as cool
as the camera

732
00:52:42.076 --> 00:52:44.785
is this thing right here.

733
00:52:44.871 --> 00:52:46.287
Do you know what it is?

734
00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:48.789
Cell-phone jammer.

735
00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:53.127
It's sort of legal. sort of not.
It's like a grey area.

736
00:52:53.171 --> 00:52:55.880
I can't believe it took me
so long to pick one up.

737
00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.884
Oh. yeah. Child locks.

738
00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:02.052
Now's about the time that
they start screaming for help.

739
00:53:02.096 --> 00:53:05.014
but if we could just
skip that tonight...

740
00:53:05.057 --> 00:53:06.849
-I've got kind of a headache.
-Come on.

741
00:53:06.893 --> 00:53:09.351
J-just pull it.
just pull over. okay?

742
00:53:09.395 --> 00:53:11.103
Like. I-Isaac's waiting for me
and I--

743
00:53:11.147 --> 00:53:12.646
I'm taking you to Isaac.

744
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:14.190
No. but we're going
the wrong way.

745
00:53:14.233 --> 00:53:16.567
He's not at home.

746
00:53:16.611 --> 00:53:17.902
What do you mean? Where is he?

747
00:53:17.945 --> 00:53:20.321
Just sit-sit back. relax.

748
00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:22.281
Enjoy the ride.

749
00:53:22.325 --> 00:53:24.200

Hey. where's Isaac?

753
00:54:19.048 --> 00:54:21.465
Oh. he's around here somewhere.

754
00:54:21.509 --> 00:54:23.342
What did you do to him?

755
00:54:23.386 --> 00:54:26.428
-You can go now.
-[Olive mumbles]

756
00:54:26.472 --> 00:54:28.430
I just need your phone first.

757
00:54:30.518 --> 00:54:32.309
-And your passcode?
-What?

758
00:54:32.353 --> 00:54:33.936
Do you want to get out
of this car?

759
00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.814
Okay. okay. 7-7-7-7.

-[Jaye] You're not kidding.

762
00:54:40.528 --> 00:54:42.528
Can you just let me out of here?

763
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:50.661
Isaac?

764
00:54:57.336 --> 00:54:58.544

-Isaac!

766
00:55:03.676 --> 00:55:08.637
[Isaac] Is anybody there?
Please! Help me!

767

don't hurt me anymore. Please.

No. No.

No.

[screaming] No!

774
00:55:41.005 --> 00:55:43.213
Hey. Myles.

[Myles groaning]

776
00:56:06.405 --> 00:56:09.281
Jane Toppan was a nurse.

777
00:56:09.325 --> 00:56:11.492
They called her Jolly Jane.

778
00:56:11.535 --> 00:56:15.829
She killed
over 30 of her own patients.

779
00:56:15.873 --> 00:56:19.208
Her favorite thing to do
was to sit with them...

780
00:56:19.251 --> 00:56:22.252
when they were dying.
watching their eyes.

781
00:56:22.296 --> 00:56:24.546
imagining how they were feeling.

782
00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:27.633
what they were seeing
as they slipped away.

783
00:56:28.886 --> 00:56:30.636
Jolly Jane.

784
00:56:32.765 --> 00:56:34.139

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

790
00:57:22.731 --> 00:57:24.606
[Tess] Jaye?

791
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:26.525
Oh...

792
00:57:26.569 --> 00:57:28.694
Oh. boy. Hey.

793
00:57:28.737 --> 00:57:31.405
-Hey. Tess.
-So you do drive for Roller.

794
00:57:32.199 --> 00:57:33.699
This is awkward.

795
00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:35.909
[Tess] Yeah.

796
00:57:35.953 --> 00:57:37.911
[Jaye] Tess. wait.

797
00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:41.999
What's wrong?

798
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:45.711
I owe you an apology.

799
00:57:45.754 --> 00:57:47.963
Really. Tess. I-I'm-I'm sorry.

800
00:57:48.007 --> 00:57:49.673
You know what. you don't have
to do this right now.

801
00:57:49.717 --> 00:57:52.009
Yeah. I do. I lied to you.

802
00:57:52.052 --> 00:57:55.095
I mean. obviously.
I. I drive for Roller.

803
00:57:55.139 --> 00:57:57.890
And I lied about being
a real-estate agent. too.

804
00:57:57.933 --> 00:58:01.435
I'm sort of a part-time
assistant to an agent

805
00:58:01.479 --> 00:58:04.521
hoping to get my license
someday soon.

806
00:58:04.565 --> 00:58:06.940
I was in a really bad marriage.

807
00:58:06.984 --> 00:58:11.820
and I'm trying to get out
of it. but it's not easy.

808
00:58:11.864 --> 00:58:14.948
Myles has me locked out
of all the bank accounts.

809
00:58:14.992 --> 00:58:17.910
It'll get sorted out in court.
but for now

810
00:58:17.953 --> 00:58:20.287
I have to make
all the cash I can.

811
00:58:20.331 --> 00:58:22.372
But why wouldn't you just
tell me all of this?

812
00:58:22.416 --> 00:58:25.792
I know. I should have.

813
00:58:25.836 --> 00:58:27.503
But you were just so fun
to be with.

814
00:58:27.546 --> 00:58:30.756
and I guess I was trying to be
who I wanted to be

815
00:58:30.799 --> 00:58:33.258
and not who I am

816
00:58:33.302 --> 00:58:36.094
'cause who I am
is kind of a mess right now.

817
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:40.849
Well. um...

818
00:58:40.893 --> 00:58:43.310
let me at least get you guys
where you're going.

819
00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.773
-Yeah. okay.
-[Jaye] You both look great.

-You passed where we're going.

826
00:59:37.992 --> 00:59:39.992
Oh. Sorry. I'm a little
distracted up here.

00:59:47.543 --> 00:59:50.711
Oh. look at me. Not exactly
five-star service. huh?

828
00:59:53.007 --> 00:59:54.381
Hang in there.

[Jaye] All of these women
who came before you.

844
01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:05.929
what did they have in common?

845
01:02:05.973 --> 01:02:10.976
Besides the killings.
they all got caught.

846
01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:15.147
And you're gonna get caught.
too. unless you get out of here.

847
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:18.024
Even if you do get out of here.
it's only a matter of time.

the videos are for.

Morning.

854
01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.260
So how'd it go with Tess?

855
01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:29.221
You seal the deal?

856
01:03:30.891 --> 01:03:32.390
What is this?

857
01:03:32.434 --> 01:03:34.392
I know.
What a coincidence. right?

858
01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:36.686
You get into my car again?

859
01:03:36.772 --> 01:03:39.356
No. this is a different car.

860
01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:41.399
Yeah. variety. Spice of life.

[Danny scoffs]

862
01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:45.737
Were you just waiting outside
Tess's place to pick me up?

863
01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.198
That's it. isn't it?

864
01:03:48.242 --> 01:03:49.825
You just wait there

865
01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:51.618
hoping I call for a ride.

866
01:03:51.662 --> 01:03:52.911
then you get first dibs on me

867
01:03:52.955 --> 01:03:54.454
because you're right there.

868
01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:56.456
[Jaye] No. That's not
what just happened.

869
01:03:57.626 --> 01:03:59.376
That's what I did yesterday.

870
01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:04.381
Are you serious?

871
01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:07.509
[chuckles]
No. I'm kidding.

872
01:04:07.553 --> 01:04:09.135
Of course I'm serious.
you dum-dum.

873
01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:13.223
... You're a stalker.

874
01:04:13.267 --> 01:04:15.267
Serial killer.

875
01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:19.354
Though stalking
is admittedly part of the gig.

876
01:04:19.398 --> 01:04:22.107
[Jaye] You ever heard
of Dorothea Puente?

877
01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:25.068
All right. You had your fun.
Pull the car over.

878
01:04:25.112 --> 01:04:28.488
-Nah.
-I said. pull the car over.

879
01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:31.283
-And I said "Nah."
-[Danny scoffs]

880
01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:36.371
You know Isaac called me OJ.

881
01:04:36.415 --> 01:04:37.414
Do you want me to call the cops?

882
01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:39.708
Uh. yeah. sure.

883
01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:40.876
[Danny] Deal. All right.

884
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.505
No signal?

885
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:49.342
Don't you hate
when that happens?

886
01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:53.013
Who's your provider?
Are you on an unlimited plan?

887
01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:55.473
...! Pull over the car!

888
01:04:55.517 --> 01:04:59.561
Hey! Are you hearing me?
Pull over the car!

889
01:04:59.605 --> 01:05:00.645
-Pull...
-[tires screeching]

891
01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:06.651
[Danny groans]

[Danny screaming]

895
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:24.669
[cell phone ringing]

896
01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:32.052
-Hey.
-[Jaye on phone] Hey.

897
01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:35.972
-Thanks for answering.
-Yeah. yeah. no problem.

898
01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:37.891
I know this is awkward.

899
01:05:37.935 --> 01:05:41.728
but I was hoping that we could still be friends.

900
01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:45.315
Yeah. of course. It's not
that big of a deal. Jaye.

901
01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:47.108
And I was wondering
if you wanted

902
01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:49.194
to come over
for drinks tonight.

903
01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:51.613
Oh. um. you know what.

904
01:05:51.657 --> 01:05:54.449
I'm-I'm actually.
I'm super busy with work.

905
01:05:54.493 --> 01:05:56.326
No pressure.

906
01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:59.120
I just wanted to see you
before I go out of town.

907
01:05:59.247 --> 01:06:02.999
-Where are you going?
-Long story.

908
01:06:03.043 --> 01:06:05.293
Well. we'll be here
if you change your mind.

909
01:06:05.337 --> 01:06:06.753
"We?"

910
01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:08.922
Isaac and Olive
are coming over.

911
01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:12.425
Oh? That's cool.

912
01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:14.761
Yeah. they're supes cool.

913
01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:16.846
[chuckles]
O-okay.

914
01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:20.141
Well. um. yeah. I'll let you
know how I'm doing with work

915
01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:21.768
and I'll just text you.

916
01:06:22.771 --> 01:06:24.270
Tight.

917
01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.272
[chuckles]
Okay. bye.

918
01:06:27.818 --> 01:06:29.025
Bye.

919
01:06:35.826 --> 01:06:36.866
[cell phone beeps]

920
01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:51.589
Jolly Jane.

921
01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:54.050
Jolly Jane.

922
01:06:54.094 --> 01:06:57.637
Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane.

923
01:06:58.682 --> 01:06:59.723
[cell phone beeps]

924
01:07:00.976 --> 01:07:02.350
Jolly Jane.

[indistinct whisperings]

930
01:08:37.405 --> 01:08:39.989
[knocking on door]

931
01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:42.826
Tess. sorry to keep you waiting.

932
01:08:42.869 --> 01:08:44.619
Thanks for coming.
It means a lot to me.

933
01:08:44.663 --> 01:08:46.579
Oh. Yeah. of course.
Thanks for inviting me.

934
01:08:46.623 --> 01:08:48.456
-Wine?
-Yes. please.

935
01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:52.585
Oh. Um. are Olive and Isaac
here?

936
01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:54.337
[Jaye] Oh. they're on their way.

937
01:08:55.966 --> 01:08:58.716
So how was your ride?

938
01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:02.929
Uh. it was fine.
Pretty uneventful.

939
01:09:02.973 --> 01:09:05.181
How many stars
did you give your driver?

940
01:09:05.225 --> 01:09:08.309
-Oh. I never do that.
-Tess. come on.

941
01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:09.602
It's part of the whole deal.

942
01:09:09.646 --> 01:09:10.520
We're all out there hustling

943
01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:12.522
for those five stars.

944
01:09:12.566 --> 01:09:14.691
Uh. yeah. I don't know.
it just...

945
01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:16.234
I don't like the idea that
I'm supposed to do something

946
01:09:16.278 --> 01:09:17.777
other than just pay for my ride.

947
01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.821
-It takes like one second.
-Well...

948
01:09:19.865 --> 01:09:22.365
What if I don't have a second
to spare?

949
01:09:22.409 --> 01:09:24.159
I mean. who looks
at those ratings anyway?

950
01:09:24.202 --> 01:09:26.035
What's your rider rating?

951
01:09:26.079 --> 01:09:27.996
-Oh. I have no clue.
-Let me see.

952
01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:29.706
Okay.

953
01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:34.627
Oh. Tess.

954
01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:37.338
-Three point three?
-Is that bad?

955
01:09:37.382 --> 01:09:38.840
[chuckles] I can't believe
you're even

956
01:09:38.884 --> 01:09:40.967
getting any rides
with a number that low.

957
01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:43.261
Whatever. I don't know who would
give me less than five stars.

958
01:09:43.305 --> 01:09:45.471
It's not like I've ever
thrown up in a car or something.

959
01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:47.515
Hope not. That's unacceptable.

960
01:09:47.559 --> 01:09:49.392
Well. then why do I have
such a low number?

961
01:09:49.436 --> 01:09:52.478
Mm... Do you ever make
your driver wait?

962
01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:55.273
Like he gets there
and you're not ready yet?

963
01:09:55.317 --> 01:09:56.941
Not really.

964
01:09:56.985 --> 01:10:00.028
Do you ever get into a car
with your headphones on?

965
01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:02.739
-What's wrong with that?
-Some drivers think it's rude.

966
01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:06.409
-I have to admit I did.
-Did what?

967
01:10:06.453 --> 01:10:08.286
I thought it was kind of rude
when you got into my car

968
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:11.039
with headphones on.

969
01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:13.333
I sort of picked you up
once or twice

970
01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:15.210
before we officially met.

971
01:10:16.046 --> 01:10:18.213
Once or twice?

972
01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:20.506
And you're just now
telling me this?

973
01:10:22.177 --> 01:10:23.259
Excuse me.

974
01:10:23.929 --> 01:10:25.220
Bathroom.

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:29.766

[gasps]

982
01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:22.360
[Olive] Yeah. okay. pull over.
I want to get out.

983
01:11:22.404 --> 01:11:24.320
[Tess on video] Say hi.
You're on camera.

984
01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:30.868
Okay. come on. come on.
I-I said to pull over.

985
01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:32.745
[Jaye] Did you know that
Isaac doesn't have a dash cam?

986
01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:33.955
-[footsteps approaching]
-[gasps]

987
01:11:33.999 --> 01:11:35.790
-Can you believe that?
-Ah!

988
01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:43.464
[indistinct whisperings]

989
01:11:48.763 --> 01:11:51.889
[dramatic music]

990
01:12:06.406 --> 01:12:08.281
[Jaye] Sorry about that.

991
01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:13.036
I would suggest
you don't do anything rash.

992
01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:14.829
I've seen it all before.

993
01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:19.083
What did you do to Olive?

994
01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:21.377
[Jaye] I'm taking you to her
right now.

995
01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:22.503
Where?

996
01:12:23.048 --> 01:12:24.213
You'll see.

997
01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:29.177
[music continues]

998
01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:37.352
This is my last ride.
As Jaye. I mean.

999
01:12:37.437 --> 01:12:39.729
It's time for me to move on
to a new city.

1000
01:12:39.773 --> 01:12:41.189
So this...

1001
01:12:43.401 --> 01:12:45.109
This is what you do?

1002
01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:49.322
Yeah. This is what I do.

1003
01:12:52.369 --> 01:12:55.161
I was on the East Coast.
and I needed to make some money.

1004
01:12:55.205 --> 01:12:57.497
So I thought
I'd start driving for Roller.

1005
01:12:59.793 --> 01:13:02.585
My very first night driving.
I had a passenger attack me.

1006
01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:07.507
Didn't go so well for that guy.

1007
01:13:07.634 --> 01:13:12.095
But it did make me realize

1008
01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:14.263
that I could use
this whole ride-share revolution

1009
01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:17.850
to pursue my own interests.

1010
01:13:20.063 --> 01:13:21.020
Who are you?

1011
01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:24.690
You don't know?

1012
01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:30.613
I'm Jaye.

1013
01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:34.826
And before Jaye I was Charlotte.

1014
01:13:34.869 --> 01:13:36.702
Before Charlotte I was Stella.

1015
01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:39.122
But that was all just practice.

1016
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.500
Getting me ready...

1017
01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:46.212
to come back home.

1018
01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:55.638
[crickets chirping]

1019
01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.867
-Where are we?
-This is where I grew up.

1020
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:17.535
I still own it.
though as you can see.

1021
01:14:17.579 --> 01:14:19.620
I haven't exactly
kept the place up.

1022
01:14:21.291 --> 01:14:23.207
So what now?

1023
01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:24.584
Olive's inside.

1024
01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:25.835
Try to run back.

1025
01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:28.546
Why should I believe you?

1026
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:31.883
I could have easily killed you
at Jaye's house.

1027
01:14:31.926 --> 01:14:34.969
That's not what this is about.
Tess. I swear.

1028
01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:37.972
[car door unlocks]

1029
01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:49.984
[dramatic music]

1030
01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:00.912
Olive?

1031
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.089
Olive?

1032
01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:16.761
Olive?

1033
01:15:20.642 --> 01:15:23.726
-[Olive] Tess? Tess. help me!
-Olive!

1034
01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:26.729
-Olive?
-[Olive] Yeah.

1035
01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:28.189
-I'm in here.
-Oh. my God. Olive.

1036
01:15:28.233 --> 01:15:29.273
[Olive] Can you help me. please?
God...

1037
01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.775
-Hey. hey. hey.
-Oh. my God.

1038
01:15:30.818 --> 01:15:32.944
[shushing] It's okay. all right?

1039
01:15:32.987 --> 01:15:34.779
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay. okay?

1040
01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:36.948
[sobbing]
Hurry.

1041
01:15:36.991 --> 01:15:38.991
-She's crazy.
-I know.

1042
01:15:39.077 --> 01:15:41.035
She killed Isaac.

1043
01:15:41.079 --> 01:15:43.538
-What?
-She killed Isaac!

1044
01:15:43.581 --> 01:15:45.581
-Isaac's dead?
-Yes.

1045
01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:47.416
Oh. my...

1046
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.336
Okay. okay. it's gonna be okay.

1047
01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:53.506
-Okay.
-Keep them tight.

1048
01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:55.216
[Jaye on tape] Tell you what.
I'll let you go.

1049
01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:56.175
but there's a price to pay.

1050
01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:56.926
[Olive on tape] Okay. anything.

1051
01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:58.678
[Jaye] If I let you go.

1052
01:15:58.805 --> 01:16:00.221
Tess has to die.

1053
01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:02.098
Is that okay with you?

1054
01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:03.849
-What?
-[Olive] Yes.

1055
01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.768
[Jaye] So you're okay
with me killing Tess?

1056
01:16:05.812 --> 01:16:07.687
-As long as I let you go?
[Olive] Yes. Yes.

1057
01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:09.397
Just do whatever. okay?

1058
01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.023
We're-we're not even.
like. friends anymore.

1059
01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:12.692
so just. just let me go. okay?
Please!

1060
01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:15.278
Can you believe that. Tess?

1061
01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:18.614
That's your best friend.

1062
01:16:18.658 --> 01:16:21.867
She sold you out
just to save her own ass.

1063
01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:24.036
Because you hurt her.
You killed her boyfriend.

1064
01:16:24.122 --> 01:16:26.956
[scoffs] Yeah.
I've killed a lot of people.

1065
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.500
What do you think
the smell from the garage is?

1066
01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:34.630
But even I wouldn't kill
my best friend.

1067
01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.716
I-I didn't mean it.

1068
01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.845
[Jaye] Yeah. she did.

1069
01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:42.680
But. Tess. I don't want
to kill you. not at all.

1070
01:16:42.724 --> 01:16:44.724
I wanna help you.

1071
01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:48.019
-Then just let us go.
-That's not helping you.

1072
01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:51.105
I want you to know what it feels
like to have real power.

1073
01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.734
I want you to kill her.

1074
01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:03.200
[Jaye] I know.
I know it sounds crazy.

1075
01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:06.245
It sounded crazy to me
at first. too.

1076
01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:13.961
You will tell them
he was hurting mommy.

1077
01:17:14.047 --> 01:17:15.755
-Do you understand me?
-Okay.

1078
01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:18.549
Nobody's gonna blame you.

1079
01:17:18.593 --> 01:17:21.427
You're just a little girl
trying to protect her mother.

1080
01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:24.388
-Hm.
-You'll be a hero.

1081
01:17:24.432 --> 01:17:27.475
[indistinct whisperings]

1082
01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:30.770
Okay. I'm gonna go.

1083
01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:32.897
I shouldn't be here
when it happens.

1084
01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:35.775
-Okay?
-Okay.

1085
01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:39.570
I love you. Cindy.

[intense music]

1088
01:18:17.944 --> 01:18:20.236
[exhales]
I didn't wanna do it.

1089
01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:25.241
Even though he could be so mean
and even though he hurt her.

1090
01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:26.992
he was still my dad.

1091
01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:29.036
And I thought
it would feel horrible...

1092
01:18:31.749 --> 01:18:35.084
but it didn't feel horrible.

1093
01:18:35.128 --> 01:18:36.836
It didn't feel horrible at all.

1094
01:18:45.513 --> 01:18:48.347
It was the best feeling
I had ever felt in my life.

1095
01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:51.267
I finally didn't feel afraid.

1096
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:54.311
I felt so powerful.

1097
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:58.482
Why?

1098
01:18:58.526 --> 01:19:00.568
Why are you telling me this?

1099
01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.488
You still don't know?

1100
01:19:05.992 --> 01:19:08.951
[baby bawling]

1101
01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:21.005
It's okay. Tess.

1102
01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:23.007
[echoing] Everything's okay now.

1103
01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:26.761
[Jaye] But it wasn't okay.

1104
01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:29.388
They blamed mom
and they separated us.

1105
01:19:30.892 --> 01:19:33.267
-No.
-Yes.

1106
01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:37.980
-We're sisters.
-No...

1107
01:19:42.487 --> 01:19:45.654
I couldn't protect you then.
but I can now.

1108
01:19:45.698 --> 01:19:48.491
I want you to know what
it feels like to have real power

1109
01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:51.869
so that you never have to feel
like a victim ever again.

1110
01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:57.708
Just kill her.

1111
01:20:03.382 --> 01:20:05.466
Come on. Tess. it'll be fun.

1112
01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.645
Oh.

1113
01:20:17.688 --> 01:20:21.649
I-I can't. I can't trust you
with the bat yet.

1114
01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:24.610
I don't know. just strangle
the bitch or something.

1115
01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:27.071
-No. Tess. Tess. don't--

Okay. okay. okay.

Come on. Come on. come on.

01:22:27.193 --> 01:22:28.400
Oh. my God. what happened?

1133
01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:30.110
Can you call someone. please?

1134
01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:32.947
