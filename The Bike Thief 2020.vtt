3
00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:19.675
Did you smoke?

4
00:08:00.708 --> 00:08:02.308
Morning duckling.

5
00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:05.408
How am I supposed to work
with him screaming non-stop?

6
00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:11.975
Good morning. grumpy.

7
00:08:12.408 --> 00:08:13.975
I'm going to put some Palinca in his milk.

8
00:08:14.275 --> 00:08:15.941
Give him to the gypsies.

9
00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:19.241
Hey!

10
00:08:19.608 --> 00:08:20.441
I'm finished.

11
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:22.541
- Finished...
- I'm finished!

12
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:24.808
- You haven't finished. Sit down and eat!
- I'm full!

13
00:08:24.908 --> 00:08:26.675
Easy. easy...

14
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:30.241
You're going to get it!

15
00:08:40.508 --> 00:08:41.775
I'm almost done.

16
00:08:42.575 --> 00:08:44.308
Take your time and finish.

17
00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:58.941
I'll be back in a minute. yes?

18
00:09:01.475 --> 00:09:02.241
Yes?

19
00:10:12.741 --> 00:10:13.975
I love you. bye.

20
00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:16.441
Will you talk to Yusuf about the heating?

21
00:10:18.508 --> 00:10:20.808
- Are you so scared?
- I'm not scared.

22
00:10:21.608 --> 00:10:22.775
Time to go.

23
00:10:23.808 --> 00:10:24.775
Talk to him!

24
00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:29.575
Funny guy!

25
00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:50.608
What?

26
00:13:30.908 --> 00:13:32.408
Good luck!

27
00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:28.408
What?

28
00:18:28.508 --> 00:18:29.875
Are you friends with that boy?

29
00:18:59.416 --> 00:19:01.549
Why don't you come and ask him yourself?

30
00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:07.549
Flying away?

31
00:19:35.016 --> 00:19:36.216
Bye. duckling.

32
00:19:36.249 --> 00:19:37.149
Bye.

33
00:19:39.583 --> 00:19:41.016
Do you have a lot to do?

34
00:19:44.949 --> 00:19:46.349
Don't stay up too late.

35
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:59.549
Maybe go talk to mum if you finish before bed...

36
00:20:00.983 --> 00:20:01.549
Okay.

37
00:20:03.316 --> 00:20:04.583
She'd like that...

38
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:13.116
Sleep well.

39
00:23:12.683 --> 00:23:14.216
Have you heard from dad?

40
00:23:14.516 --> 00:23:15.616
Not yet.

41
00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:30.549
Have you got your hot water bottle?

42
00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:37.483
Enough with the phone.

43
00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.383
Just a bit longer.

44
00:23:47.016 --> 00:23:48.016
Goodnight.

45
00:31:00.483 --> 00:31:01.683
What happened?

46
00:31:02.183 --> 00:31:04.916
- Why are you up so early?
- What happened?

47
00:31:05.649 --> 00:31:07.249
- Babies are sleeping...
- Tell me!

48
00:31:09.983 --> 00:31:11.383
There was a little thing with the bike.

49
00:31:13.316 --> 00:31:15.049
It broke down but it's okay.

50
00:31:15.683 --> 00:31:16.583
How much?

51
00:31:17.316 --> 00:31:18.983
I just took it to the garage.

52
00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:22.949
At four in the morning?

53
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:38.583
It's just some guys.

54
00:31:39.683 --> 00:31:40.916
What guys?

55
00:31:43.249 --> 00:31:45.049
And then Victor gave me a lift home.

56
00:31:47.349 --> 00:31:48.149
Did you smoke?

57
00:31:52.583 --> 00:31:54.349
I guess I'm taking the bus...?

58
00:32:09.583 --> 00:32:11.283
Miri's old enough to walk.

59
00:32:11.349 --> 00:32:12.583
I have time to walk her.

60
00:32:12.949 --> 00:32:13.949
Are you sure?

61
00:32:14.683 --> 00:32:17.049
I don't like her walking alone around here.

62
00:32:18.283 --> 00:32:20.916
We have enough to pay the rent.

63
00:32:22.449 --> 00:32:24.016
How long 'til the bike's fixed?

64
00:32:24.916 --> 00:32:27.016
Tonight... tonight.

65
00:32:27.383 --> 00:32:28.949
What if it's not ready?

66
00:32:29.916 --> 00:32:31.549
They will just lend you another?

67
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:39.016
You had me worried...

68
00:32:51.416 --> 00:32:53.349
I don't need you to walk with me.

69
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:55.949
I thought it would be nice.

70
00:32:57.016 --> 00:32:58.249
We can chat.

71
00:32:58.649 --> 00:32:59.983
About what?

72
00:33:00.249 --> 00:33:02.083
Whatever you want.

73
00:33:04.516 --> 00:33:06.216
What is it now?

74
00:33:09.183 --> 00:33:10.016
Come here!

75
00:33:10.416 --> 00:33:12.016
Dad. what are you doing?!

76
00:33:12.283 --> 00:33:13.516
Dad. stop!

77
00:33:13.916 --> 00:33:15.116
What did you do?

78
00:33:18.116 --> 00:33:18.683
Let go of him!

79
00:33:27.449 --> 00:33:28.249
Dad... please!

80
00:33:28.516 --> 00:33:29.616
You don't understand!

81
00:33:29.916 --> 00:33:30.549
What?

82
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:55.616
Come back!

83
00:34:00.016 --> 00:34:01.583
Come back here right now!

84
00:34:02.249 --> 00:34:03.116
Stop!

85
00:34:03.283 --> 00:34:04.149
Leave me alone!

86
00:34:04.483 --> 00:34:05.416
Stop now!

87
00:52:47.199 --> 00:52:48.199
It's me.

88
00:52:48.733 --> 00:52:49.733
- What's up?

89
00:52:50.866 --> 00:52:52.499
Any word on the bike?

90
00:52:54.366 --> 00:52:55.733
It's fine.

91
00:52:56.499 --> 00:52:58.833
- I have kind of bad news.

92
00:52:59.499 --> 00:53:00.633
Are you okay?

93
00:53:00.766 --> 00:53:05.866
- The lady I was working for today.
she came home early. found Toma...

94
00:53:06.366 --> 00:53:07.466
So what?

95
00:53:07.799 --> 00:53:09.466
You know this...

96
00:53:09.699 --> 00:53:11.733
I'm not allowed to bring the kid to work.

97
00:53:14.433 --> 00:53:16.233
I think she made a complaint.

98
00:53:21.233 --> 00:53:23.433
- I don't know what we're going to do.

99
00:53:26.766 --> 00:53:28.366
- Are you picking up Miri?

100
00:53:30.833 --> 00:53:32.266
I'll try.

101
00:53:32.399 --> 00:53:33.699
- I thought you said you could?

102
00:53:34.433 --> 00:53:35.499
I will!

103
00:53:36.299 --> 00:53:38.199
- You'll be able to work this evening?

104
00:53:39.733 --> 00:53:40.599
- Hello?

105
00:53:40.799 --> 00:53:41.766
Got to run.

106
00:53:41.833 --> 00:53:44.299
- Did you talk about the heating?
- I love you
