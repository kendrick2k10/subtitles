3
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.960
Move those boxes. Faster!

4
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.320
Are we almost done?

5
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.400
Come on. boys.

6
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.360
"Empty nets today. full nets tomorrow."

7
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.120
Isn't that what they say?

8
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.480
Go home and eat your greens.

9
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.120
Come on. Elliott.

10
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.800
Good work today. boys.

11
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.960
But the ocean was still asleep.

12
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.960
-Yet again. Esben?
-Isn't that what they say?

13
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.480
No. but you do.

14
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.480
Use your energy at sea
and you might get a full envelope.

15
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.720
Paycheck on the table.

16
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.880
-See you.
-Seriously. man.

17
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.600
-You want to lose your wages?
-Can it.

18
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.000
Tell Oliver he owes me from last time.
If he doesn't pay up. I'll kill him!

19
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.520
-Want to join me for a bite to eat?
-No. thanks.

20
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.640
Oliver's playing at a gig this evening.

21
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.200
I promised I'd play some guitar.

22
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.720
Are you sure about Oliver?

23
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.720
I thought you didn't care.

24
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.720
It's fine. See you tomorrow.

25
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.040
Get that chain oiled.

26
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.040
What's going on? What are you doing?

27
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.920
It's called a job. Ring a bell?

28
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.040
-I kissed a lot of ass to get this gig.
-I thought you enjoyed kissing ass.

29
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.360
Thank you. everybody.

30
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.400
-Do I smell?
-Go away.

31
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.880
You idiot. That's Suzanne Taylor in there.

32
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.960
Vince Taylor's widow. And Patrick.
who produced his biggest hits.

33
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.520
They can fix everything.
The biggest stages.

34
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.080
-Understand?
-Yes.

35
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.560
-Yeah?
-Do you have my money?

36
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.720
-Here you go. 2.000.
-Thanks.

37
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.120
The two of us. right?
We own that stage tonight.

38
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.920
We go in there and kill it. Understood?

39
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.720
-Got it. You own the stage.
-Totally. This is going to be great.

40
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.400
-Do you want a chord?
-Yeah.

41
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.520
-First line?
-Sure.

42
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.200
You've got it. Stay low during the bridge.

43
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.200
Save the falsetto for the chorus.

44
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.960
Let's celebrate.

45
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.720
Cheers!

46
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.400
And congratulations.

47
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.240
Thanks for coming.

48
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.600
Thanks for being here.

49
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.040
It's a huge opportunity for me.

50
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.480
-It's gonna happen!
-Great.

51
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.400
I'm ready.

52
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.880
Yes. Good evening.

53
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.120
Good evening.

54
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.480
You look amazing.

55
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.120
My name's Oliver.

56
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.760
And Suzanne.

57
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.560
-This song's for you.
-Thanks.

58
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.920
Hey!

59
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.240
Don't just fuck off.
We have to find out if she liked it.

60
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.280
Don't worry. Go inside and ask her.

61
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.320
No. I want you to come.

62
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.360
Hey.

63
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.800
Who was supposed to sing?

64
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.520
Seriously?

65
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.000
Okay. I fucked up.

66
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.840
And you saved my ass in there.
and you were great. Okay?

67
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.040
-What the hell's your problem?
-My problem?

68
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.880
You make me go up on stage
in front of all those people

69
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.520
and make a fool of myself
just to save your ass.

70
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.000
-You don't know your shit.
-Chill.

71
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.600
-This is your fucking job.
-Chill.

72
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.400
-It's you and me.
-Is it?

73
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.520
It is.

74
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.440
Hey.

75
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.640
I'd die for you. okay?

76
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.480
You're my best friend.

77
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.360
-Just shut up now.
-You shut up.

78
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.840
If we have nothing to die for.
what the hell do we live for?

79
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.960
-Huh?
-Good night.

80
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.120
Come on. man.

81
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.880
Well. look at that. It's Tom and Jerry.

82
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.960
-Beat it. Dennis.
-Zip it!

83
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.480
-Girls' night out? Hey!
-Fuck!

84
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.720
I've been calling you all day.
What's going on?

85
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.040
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

86
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.800
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

87
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.480
We play cards and you lose.
You don't pay up. What's with that?

88
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.120
Did you spend all your dad's money?

89
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.480
Show me your watch.

90
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.160
-Fuck off!
-So you're a tough guy. huh?

91
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.720
You want me to punch you in the gut?

92
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.640
Dennis!

93
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.080
No!

94
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.680
Hey! Let him go!

95
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.720
No. Elliott!

96
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.640
Elliott. stop!

97
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.160
Elliott!

98
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.920
Did I ruin your birthday party?

99
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.000
You know who my husband was.

100
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.320
Twenty-two years at number one.

101
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.000
Sixteen platinum records.

102
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.200
Better sales figures
than the rest of the top ten combined.

103
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280
Wow.

104
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.800
That's impressive.

105
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.280
That song you sang. who wrote it?

106
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.480
I did.

107
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.600
I haven't heard many good songs
since he died.

108
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.840
What do you want?

109
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.120
Why are you here?

110
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.440
I can get you out of here.

111
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.160
But

112
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.160
you'd need to commit
to spending some time with me.

113
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.680
Ten thousand a week.

114
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.160
Come and hang out for a bit.

115
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.120
We'll see how it goes.

116
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.040
See you tomorrow.

117
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.240
This is Oliver.

118
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.840
Don't leave a message.

119
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.840
Hello?

120
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.360
It's me.

121
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.080
Yeah.

122
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.960
What's going on?
Why aren't you picking up?

123
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.920
What the hell do you think is going on?

124
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.720
I'm in Hamburg. That's what's going on.

125
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.960
At my dad's office.

126
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.680
He forced me down here after your stunt.

127
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.520
I was trying to help.

128
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.680
Help? Okay.

129
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.240
You're a great friend. you know?

130
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.960
I told you to leave him alone.

131
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.160
Now my dad knows I owe
those fucking losers because of you.

132
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.920
Don't call me again. okay?

133
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.000
Ollie.

134
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.400
What are you doing?

135
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.200
-I thought it was over.
-What are you talking about?

136
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.640
Dennis is in bed at home
with a face like a massive fish cake.

137
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.880
-He didn't like the gig.
-Listen.

138
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.600
If you go to jail.

139
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.800
you can't work for me.

140
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.640
You'll lose the boat
and never get out of here.

141
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.160
She offered me a job.

142
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.600
-Who?
-That woman. Suzanne.

143
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.160
Why are you still here. then?

144
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.440
Fuck that shit.

145
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.720
-I want nothing to do with her.
-She pays more than me.

146
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.400
Spend it on the boat.

147
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.040
Or buy me something.
I could use another truck.

148
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.760
A foxtail for your antenna?

149
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.120
Load the boxes onto the truck.

150
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.800
Yeah. Those right there.

151
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.640
Check out the pad. dude.

152
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.160
What are we dropping off?

153
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.120
You.

154
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.760
Shut up!

155
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.680
-Shut the fuck up.
-No.

156
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.520
You shut the fuck up.
Move your ass and get in there.

157
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.480
Look at me.

158
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.400
Elliott.

159
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.000
I'll be 48 soon.

160
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.080
I'll be lugging boxes
until my legs give out.

161
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.360
-Your big chance is in there.
-No. it isn't.

162
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.440
-Yes. it is.
-No.

163
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.640
Yes.

164
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.200
-No.
-Yes. it is.

165
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.200
Now scram.

166
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.280
-You're fired.
-You can't fire me.

167
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.120
But I just did.

168
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.640
You damn well didn't.

169
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.240
Out!

170
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.680
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

171
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.320
-Your old legs will miss me.
-I'll have to get prosthetics.

172
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.600
I owe you. man.

173
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.240
Where are you going?

174
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.800
I'm leaving.

175
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.480
I'm going back to London.
I have loads of stuff to do.

176
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.960
But you just got here.

177
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.880
-I haven't talked to you yet.
-Patrick asked me to come.

178
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.520
Okay?

179
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.280
It was good seeing you.

180
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.600
Happy birthday.

181
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.440
There is no job waiting in London.

182
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.560
John hasn't seen you in months.

183
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.880
We haven't spoken either.
Where have you been?

184
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.720
-See you.
-Lilly.

185
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.760
Hi. Elliott.

186
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.240
Come in.

187
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.080
Great you could make it.

188
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.120
Why's he here?

189
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.280
I promised Julie at the police station

190
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.120
he'd learn how to behave a bit better.

191
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.720
Don't look at me.

192
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.080
Let's see what happens.

193
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.720
Maybe he can write some stuff.

194
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.880
Maybe you could stay.

195
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.960
Produce it.

196
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.720
This is so typical.

197
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.120
You heard the same as me.

198
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.320
What I heard I've heard before.

199
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.680
He has no training. no direction.

200
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.240
He's a drunken fisherman with a guitar.

201
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.000
But he can sing. And he can write.

202
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.840
You're the best producer I know.

203
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.160
This is great.

204
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.560
Anything I can do?

205
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.440
You can stop being such a smart-ass.

206
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.640
And start doing whatever she says.

207
00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.720
Okay?

208
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.800
See what he's got.

209
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.800
If it's crap.
there's another flight on Monday.

210
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.400
Is that what you want?

211
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.840
No.

212
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.120
Why are you here?

213
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.120
For the money.

214
00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.160
Pick up a guitar.

215
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.400
Aye. aye.

216
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.200
Play.

217
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.120
What song?

218
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.720
Whatever you feel like.

219
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.240
Can I swap this?

220
00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.560
Good morning. birthday kid.

221
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.960
-Morning.
-I got shit-faced last night.

222
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.000
What the hell's he doing here?

223
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.160
Su. no!

224
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.320
What are you thinking?

225
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.040
She needs to succeed at something.

226
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360
Sure. Suz.

227
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.440
I get that.

228
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.480
They could go places together.

229
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.560
-If we give them a hand.
-Sure. but…

230
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.800
That guy?

231
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.800
I mean…

232
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.400
He's no Vince Taylor.

233
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.080
Nobody is.

234
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.520
No.

235
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.040
You got her home.

236
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.800
And you want her to stay.

237
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.360
Don't you know any other songs?

238
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.120
Sure.

239
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.200
-Have you written any other songs?
-Loads.

240
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.560
Okay. so play one of them.

241
00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.280
-What?
-What's that song called?

242
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.000
It's called "Original."

243
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.360
Okay.

244
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.080
That's the most unoriginal thing
I've heard in a long time.

245
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.640
Okay. Pretty impressive
after hearing only eight seconds of it.

246
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.000
You can sing.

247
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.120
Sing something
that means something to you.

248
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.480
Something that makes you happy

249
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.640
or that's painful.

250
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.520
Why didn't you say so?

251
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.080
That'll be all.

252
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.520
I agree it's been a great day.

253
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.880
Good morning.

254
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.720
Have you been here long?

255
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.040
Four hours.

256
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.400
-You're four hours late.
-Right.

257
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.800
Why are you here?

258
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.360
Why are you?

259
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.560
My mom thinks you've got something.

260
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.520
I don't.

261
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.640
I think this is a waste of our time.

262
00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.520
-So why are you here?
-I wish I knew.

263
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.000
In a moment of weakness.

264
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.880
I thought there was something
hidden beneath that arrogant exterior.

265
00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.320
You think you're so amazing. don't you?

266
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.080
How's it going?

267
00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.840
He can sing.

268
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.920
But he's afraid to.

269
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.520
He keeps me at arm's length.

270
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.800
He keeps himself at arm's length.

271
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.040
There's something there.

272
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.520
I meant how you're doing.

273
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.040
Fine.

274
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.120
I'm just fine.

275
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.720
-Lilly. can't we try--
-Stop.

276
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.400
He can't do it here.

277
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.400
It's Vincent Taylor's studio.
It stresses him out.

278
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.640
The whole…

279
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
weight of it.

280
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.920
It's difficult.

281
00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.040
What do you think?

282
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.600
You live here?

283
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.120
No. I dropped by and decided to undress.

284
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.280
Listen.

285
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.560
If we're going to do this.
we've got to do it right.

286
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.640
Quit bullshitting.

287
00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.800
Get dressed.

288
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.720
Get your hands off my radio.

289
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.640
Thanks.

290
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.360
You listen to that?

291
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.600
That's Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2
in C minor. Yes. I listen to that.

292
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.800
"Rach" what?

293
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.680
"Maninoff."

294
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.880
Rachmaninoff.

295
00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.600
Of course. That's really special.

296
00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.840
D minor.

297
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.920
C minor.

298
00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:56.560
It might have been composed in C.
but this is in D minor.

299
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.760
Listen.

300
00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.880
I'm listening.

301
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.960
What about you. Elliott?
How long have you been singing?

302
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.360
Forever. I think.

303
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.240
As long as I remember.

304
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.920
-Since I was a child.
-Did you play in a band? Take classes?

305
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
No.

306
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.960
I think I just play whatever I hear.

307
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.680
I think.

308
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.000
Why is someone with your voice
sorting lobsters at the docks?

309
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.280
Because people like you
pay big money for them.

310
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.560
Touché.

311
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.920
It doesn't matter who you are.

312
00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.840
What's important is who you can be.

313
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.480
So what's the plan?

314
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.920
We need to make a demo.

315
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.360
Easy now. We have a bridge.

316
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.720
A bridge isn't a song.
We need verses and a chorus.

317
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.520
It'll come.

318
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.480
-So…
-Patrick has at least ten in his drawer.

319
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.160
Who's producing it? You or me?

320
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.320
-Barbecue. A little more barbecue.
-It's magic.

321
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.320
-There you go.
-It looks great.

322
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.520
Would you like some?

323
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.800
Okay. Tuck in.

324
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.480
It was so fucking crazy. bro.
The stadium was packed.

325
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.080
It was almost like a riot in there.

326
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.160
There were just as many people
outside without tickets.

327
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.240
Vince was in the zone.

328
00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.560
He played flat out
for the next three hours.

329
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.280
And we. idiots that we are.

330
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.400
were at the airport.

331
00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.800
waiting for him.

332
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.680
Do you remember. Lilly?

333
00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.120
We were supposed to fly back to Europe.

334
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.240
You were maybe 14 or 15. right?

335
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.160
No. I was nine.

336
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.560
Nine? No.

337
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.520
I turned ten the next day.
That's why we had to go home.

338
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.120
We waited at the airport.
but he never showed.

339
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.640
He'd gone to a park to play a concert

340
00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.280
for those who couldn't
get into the stadium.

341
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.200
All night.

342
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.720
We only left the next day.

343
00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.200
He went straight to a huge job in Berlin.

344
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.320
On my tenth birthday.

345
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.840
Sure. he was very…

346
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.120
dedicated.

347
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.480
You need to be able to prioritize work
and perform under pressure.

348
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.920
Your dad understood that.
I'm sure you do too.

349
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.760
Dad's songs were crap at the end.

350
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.640
He prioritized work
and lost himself along the way.

351
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.520
-You can't have this life and a family.
-Sure you can.

352
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.360
You just have to decide to do it.

353
00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.960
-Your dad made his own choices.
-You never stopped him.

354
00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.240
-Lilly.
-Not when he bailed on my birthday.

355
00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.920
Not when he left us for three years.
and not when he jumped.

356
00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.360
Lilly.

357
00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:33.600
Morning.

358
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.160
You always fell asleep like that.

359
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.880
Where were you that night?

360
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.920
You had a lot of calls
from his hotel room that night.

361
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.040
-Listen.
-Why didn't you pick up?

362
00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.400
Lilly.

363
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.080
-Good morning.
-Morning.

364
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.440
Play the first verse.

365
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.760
Did you add the guitar?

366
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.560
Very cool. Did you do just do that?

367
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.480
Yes.

368
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.400
-Awesome.
-Let's start with the bridge.

369
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.920
-The bridge?
-Okay?

370
00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:45.960
Great.

371
00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.960
This is great.

372
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.680
Great work.

373
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.520
Both of you.

374
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.600
-Do you have a chorus?
-No.

375
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.880
It'll come when he's ready.

376
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.440
We need to solicit offers
from a record label.

377
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.720
We do that by showing
that we have an audience.

378
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.840
We'll post the song on social media
and take it from there.

379
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.680
I'm not on social media.

380
00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.040
No. Vince has four million followers.

381
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.320
Nothing's been posted since he died.

382
00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.440
-Your song will be the first.
-That's genius. Suz.

383
00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:13.080
We'll do a live recording
of you singing the song to the camera.

384
00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.680
We'll post it and link to the demo.

385
00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.680
What do you mean by a live recording?

386
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.120
-A recording where you sing the song.
-You said 10.000 a week.

387
00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.600
To avoid jail.

388
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.560
Just hang out here. You remember that?

389
00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.040
Did you expect a free ride?
Think this was some kind of holiday?

390
00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.840
You hang out. get free food and board?

391
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.920
This is no joke.

392
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.600
Fuck this.

393
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.880
-Great.
-Lilly.

394
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.760
Elliott.

395
00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.840
Elliott.

396
00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.400
-Did you know about this?
-No.

397
00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.640
She says some silly things sometimes.

398
00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.800
Just drop this shit.

399
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.840
I know you're having a tough time.

400
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.120
Sure. Rich girl from the Taylor family.
You know about things being tough.

401
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.320
You think you're the only one
who's had a fucked up life?

402
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.880
-Shut up.
-You feel so sorry for yourself.

403
00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:18.280
You're alone in this world
because you don't put yourself out there.

404
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.640
You know shit about who I am.

405
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.080
You're a coward.

406
00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.280
Wasting your talent because you're afraid.

407
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.280
Who do you sing for when you sing?

408
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.560
A song doesn't exist on its own.

409
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.920
It comes to life between two people.

410
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.120
The singer

411
00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.720
and the listener.

412
00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.560
Whether you're here. in the studio.

413
00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.560
or in a packed stadium
full of thousands of people.

414
00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.200
you don't sing into a void.

415
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.840
You have to choose a person

416
00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.640
or imagine there's someone
you're singing to.

417
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.480
Singing for.

418
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.440
If you're not singing for anyone. then…

419
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.520
Then it's all for nothing.
The song doesn't matter.

420
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.760
You don't matter.

421
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.800
Suz.

422
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.040
Honestly. I don't know.

423
00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.360
I think he's a nobody.

424
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.120
We've all been a nobody.

425
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.320
Sure.

426
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.760
Is she okay?

427
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.000
I don't know.

428
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.040
Are you okay?

429
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.440
What happened there?

430
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.960
Do you understand my Swedish. bro?

431
00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.120
I fucking love this shit.

432
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.240
Thanks. What the hell just happened. man?

433
00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.840
Awesome. man.

434
00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.000
Hi. My name's Elliott Winther and I'm…

435
00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.720
No. bro. A little cheerier. Bro. come on.

436
00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.800
Give me a bit more confidence. okay?

437
00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.680
From the beginning. More confidence.

438
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.600
Okay. bro.

439
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.480
Hi. My name's Elliott Winther.
and I hope this song is for you.

440
00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.680
Watch your head.

441
00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.760
It's beautiful.

442
00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.240
It was my dad's.

443
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.320
Is that you?

444
00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.360
I was seven.

445
00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.240
One of the last times I saw them.

446
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.440
What happened to them?

447
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.360
They went out on this boat.

448
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.520
There was a storm.

449
00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.480
They fell overboard.

450
00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.320
Yeah.

451
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.640
It was kept on land for ten years

452
00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.640
while I lived in other places.

453
00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.640
What other places?

454
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.560
With foster families.
In three or four children's homes.

455
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.160
I guess I wasn't…

456
00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.040
What's the expression?

457
00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.200
An easy child.

458
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.200
Have you sailed since?

459
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.200
I'm saving up.

460
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:28.840
And…

461
00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.800
I'm hoping to take it out.

462
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.920
-Soon. I hope.
-Okay. Where to?

463
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.760
Around the world.

464
00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.800
Why?

465
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.600
My parents never made it.

466
00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.640
Travelling the world
isn't as great as people think.

467
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.560
New people.

468
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.760
New places.

469
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:02.840
New languages.

470
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:05.880
All the time.

471
00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.000
Always. Your whole life.

472
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.440
Just to follow a father
who was never there anyway.

473
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.640
Does that explain your French accent?

474
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.760
It's not French.

475
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.280
How did he die? Your dad?

476
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.960
He jumped from the balcony
of his hotel room.

477
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.680
After a concert.

478
00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.520
Shit.

479
00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.640
Do you remember them?

480
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.040
Yes.

481
00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.640
I remember they always sang to me.

482
00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.800
Music everywhere. the whole time.

483
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.000
A competition to see
who could sing loudest.

484
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.440
My dad never sang to me.

485
00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.280
He sang to the world.

486
00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.080
But never for me.

487
00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.120
-Don't look at me like that.
-Like what?

488
00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.120
-How?
-Like that.

489
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.200
-I'm not doing anything.
-You are.

490
00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.360
I hope you like baked beans.

491
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.560
-Are they hot?
-You want them hot?

492
00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.400
Rise and shine. little piggies!

493
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.960
We have a new king in town.

494
00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.360
-Hi. darling.
-Hi.

495
00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.840
What are you guys doing?

496
00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.760
Having breakfast.

497
00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.760
Having breakfast?

498
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.120
Super romantic. right?

499
00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.320
-Holy shit. What is this?
-Baked beans.

500
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.000
You won't be eating this again.
You know why?

501
00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.320
"This Song Is For You"

502
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.680
isn't just for you. Lilly.

503
00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.360
We've had over 500.000 views
since yesterday.

504
00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:34.880
It's trending at number one on YouTube
and has gone viral on TikTok.

505
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.600
What does that mean?

506
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.560
Goldilocks. you're a fucking star. bro.

507
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.320
-You're messing with me.
-No.

508
00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.040
-You're kidding.
-No. bro.

509
00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.160
It's true.

510
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.600
Let's go.

511
00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.360
We're rolling.

512
00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.440
Come on!

513
00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.040
Are you ready?

514
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.440
At number one for the fifth week in a row.

515
00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.920
former fisherman turned pop star.

516
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.880
the man it's impossible to ignore.
Elliott Winther.

517
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.880
Here's "I Hope This Song Is For You."

518
00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.640
We know him from TikTok.
from Instagram and YouTube.

519
00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.360
"I Hope This Song Is For You." Huge hit.

520
00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:39.680
Exploded out of the stratosphere.
This has got to be every man's dream.

521
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.080
It's crazy.

522
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.080
I don't think I've…

523
00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:45.280
I just need to understand what's going on.

524
00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.920
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-Come here.

525
00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:29.760
I couldn't abandon my best friend.

526
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.280
Shit. you look crazy.

527
00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.080
-What about your dad?
-Fuck him.

528
00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.240
Now we're going to live it up. okay?

529
00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:38.920
Rock star.

530
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.360
Come inside.

531
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.520
No. I'll just…

532
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.600
-It's fine. Have fun.
-Come on.

533
00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.760
Hey. come on.

534
00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:49.760
You need to air this place out.

535
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.840
On the house. my friend.

536
00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.800
Is it? On the house?

537
00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.360
What's up. man? Seriously!

538
00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.680
What a stud.

539
00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:18.120
So what's up with Lilly?

540
00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.680
-What about her?
-What about her? Is she good?

541
00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.960
Is she up for it?

542
00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.560
-Sure.
-She's up for it?

543
00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.640
Sure. She's up for it. But she's…

544
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.000
She's talented.

545
00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.240
She's talented?

546
00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:33.600
What's she talented at?

547
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.200
-Shut up.
-How talented?

548
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.520
Stop it.

549
00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.360
You're messing with me.
She's talented. Right!

550
00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.280
So tell me.

551
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.720
What happened?
Did she just reach out to you?

552
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.360
Suzanne.

553
00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:53.800
When?

554
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.080
After the gig.

555
00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.120
My gig?

556
00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.720
-I've got to run.
-No.

557
00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.240
Stay put. man. Stay.

558
00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.760
-We only just got here.
-I'm singing tomorrow.

559
00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.240
I get all this pussy when you're around.

560
00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.800
-It's crazy. man.
-Stop it.

561
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.280
Huge star. People love you. man.

562
00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.880
Right? And I've always known it.

563
00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.640
Always. I've always said it.

564
00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:17.600
I'm happy everyone can see it now.

565
00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.560
You're a fucking star.

566
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:21.040
Cheers.

567
00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:30.440
Look at that.
Fucking hell. it's your song.

568
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.480
Thank you. DJ.

569
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.200
They're playing your song.
We own this place. dude.

570
00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.080
He's sitting right here.
ladies and gentlemen.

571
00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.200
Elliott Winther!

572
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.080
-The king…
-Stop it!

573
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.520
Come here! Something to drink?
Yes. you two.

574
00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:47.520
-This is embarrassing.
-Girls!

575
00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:23.160
-The two of them are a good fit.
-Right. They're spot on.

576
00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.840
-They're…
-It works well.

577
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.320
Hi.

578
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:27.800
Hi.

579
00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.360
Sorry we're late. Oliver's fault.

580
00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.320
-Shut up.
-But it was.

581
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.080
Hi. guys.

582
00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.880
That looks crazy. What is it?

583
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.440
We need to talk about a few things.

584
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.960
-Confidentially.
-Sure.

585
00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.080
-That's fine.
-I won't say anything.

586
00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:50.280
Okay. Several companies are interested.
so we have to make that album in a hurry.

587
00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.080
We have seven out of ten songs.

588
00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.880
You and Lilly do the last three.

589
00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:57.400
I'll arrange the last interviews.

590
00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:59.520
Okay. This is crazy.

591
00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.840
We've hired two social media consultants

592
00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:04.560
to run your TikTok. Snapchat.
Insta. and Facebook.

593
00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:06.720
They'll manage them and reply for you.

594
00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:07.680
Patrick.

595
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.040
So you have your shoes. your clothes.

596
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.400
And there's your stage. your set design.

597
00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.040
We keep it all blue.

598
00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.760
-This looks crazy.
-There's your shoot as well.

599
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:21.960
-Yes.
-We think…

600
00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.520
-These three are super cool. Right.
-Yes.

601
00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:28.400
We have to pick an album cover
for you as well. so…

602
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.040
What do you think?

603
00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:32.960
I think…

604
00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.960
I don't really know. Isn't that a bit…

605
00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.160
A bit what?

606
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.880
You look angry.

607
00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:45.440
-I'd go with the blue one.
-Sure. That one's really cool.

608
00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:49.120
If you want your balls to be the star.
Can't see your face. bro.

609
00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.880
The band has been waiting
since nine. Lilly?

610
00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.800
I'm ready when Elliott is.

611
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.320
I'm ready. Let's get started.

612
00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.840
Use that one. That one's cool.
It works well with that one.

613
01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.080
-Super cool.
-Elliott?

614
01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.520
It's cool. He's just hanging out.

615
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.440
It's fucking great.

616
01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.280
That guy is a fucking bad singer.

617
01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.800
Fuck. that's great. It's crazy.

618
01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.520
-He's insane. man.
-Please sit down.

619
01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.240
-What?
-You're disturbing me.

620
01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.120
Okay. I just said that…

621
01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.800
You're here because Elliott insisted.

622
01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.480
I don't need you here.

623
01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.040
Do we understand each other?

624
01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.960
Well? Just sit down.

625
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.160
-Hey.
-Hi.

626
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.120
What's up?

627
01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.440
Great. right?

628
01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.360
Stay and do a few takes on the vocals.

629
01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.480
Why?

630
01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.720
You missed a few beats.

631
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.720
Can't you get Patrick to Melodyne it.
or do it in the mix or something?

632
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.080
What?

633
01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.960
Sure. Okay.

634
01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:10.960
Hey.

635
01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.400
See you later. okay?

636
01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.280
Why are you suddenly so self-righteous?

637
01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.600
-I'm not.
-You are.

638
01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.720
That girl was ready for a threesome.

639
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.920
She really was.

640
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.600
-Shut up.
-Come here.

641
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.840
I've missed you. man.

642
01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.600
Fucking Hamburg.
What was I supposed to do there?

643
01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.760
I have to be here.

644
01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.640
You and me. man. The two of us.

645
01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.640
All that. Our dreams and stuff.

646
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.520
I have to be here.

647
01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.520
My finances are pretty bad.

648
01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.240
Your finances?

649
01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.600
What about your dad?

650
01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.600
He closed the account.

651
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.320
-What?
-He was pissed off I left the office.

652
01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.640
-He'll come around. He's your dad.
-Shut up about my dad.

653
01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:05.760
Please stop.

654
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.400
Okay?

655
01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.960
I don't wanna talk about him.

656
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.280
Is there anything I can do? We can do?

657
01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.960
You don't have that much.

658
01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.200
-What do you need?
-Nothing.

659
01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.280
Nothing?

660
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.520
Hey.

661
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.760
What you have…

662
01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.920
What you've landed.

663
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.280
-That was ours. Make me part of it.
-Stop.

664
01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.640
-That's not how it works.
-We're friends. We promised each other.

665
01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.040
-It doesn't work that way.
-No?

666
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.120
So how does it work. Elliott?

667
01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.480
You can take my words
and use them in your songs?

668
01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.680
Is that how it works?

669
01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.760
That's what you did.

670
01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.760
Come on. That's my hook. right?

671
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.680
"If we've nothing to die for.
what are we living for?" I said that.

672
01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.080
-You don't mean that.
-I do.

673
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.080
I really do.

674
01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:12.760
Get me on the album.

675
01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.680
I wrote all those songs.

676
01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.160
You've never written a song.
Not one fucking line.

677
01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.000
I saved your ass.

678
01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.280
You stole my words! Get it into your head!

679
01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.960
Who would you be if it weren't for me?

680
01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.160
Where would you be? On the docks.

681
01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:36.320
I got you that gig.
I paid for you to come.

682
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:39.320
You'd have nothing if it weren't for me.

683
01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.360
The least you can do is take me with you.

684
01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.120
You're living my life. Do you understand?

685
01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.600
This is my dream. man.

686
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.880
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Seriously? What the hell?

687
01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.560
Fuck you.

688
01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.000
One.

689
01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.760
One song. Then we'll forget all this.

690
01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.760
One song.

691
01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.640
You can do that.

692
01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.280
-We'll do it again.
-Okay.

693
01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.120
-Relax. From the top.
-Okay.

694
01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:48.320
Definitely. Cool.

695
01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.200
It's not working.

696
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.160
Not working.

697
01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.880
One more time. Ollie.
We're just having some technical issues.

698
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.080
Get it together.

699
01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.080
-Ollie? Come on.
-Yes?

700
01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.840
-What's going on?
-From the top.

701
01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.040
Bro. we don't have time for this.

702
01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.320
This is shit!

703
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.520
Again!

704
01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.920
This sounds so…

705
01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:31.920
Fuck!

706
01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.160
-Can I say something?
-Can't you auto-tune him?

707
01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.720
No. I can't. Come on.

708
01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.680
Bro. I can't tune that.

709
01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.320
I can mute him.

710
01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.000
I can…

711
01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.120
I can replace his ass
with a real fucking singer.

712
01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.400
You understand?
We don't have time for this.

713
01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.840
-Come on.
-Elliott. can't you just…

714
01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.600
Again. Let's go.

715
01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.080
I want him out. Why's he here?

716
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.040
Oliver's his only friend.
What do you want me to do?

717
01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.920
-No!
-Suzanne.

718
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.680
Not everyone fits in the same mold.

719
01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.760
He has to be on board or it won't work.

720
01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.040
"Not everyone."

721
01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.520
He's not Dad. You can't turn him into Dad.
Dad's gone.

722
01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.560
I thought you could handle this task.
If you can't. I'll do it myself.

723
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.440
-He's not ready!
-Your job was to get him ready.

724
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:50.000
My job is to set him free
to become who he needs to be.

725
01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.280
Give him a long life of music.

726
01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:55.240
If you force him through the machine.
he'll break.

727
01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.040
And we both know how that ends.

728
01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.720
You got what you could out of him.

729
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.800
Fine. Quit like you always do
when things get tough.

730
01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.800
Go back to London.
John might give you another chance.

731
01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.360
Or wherever you think
it's more important to be.

732
01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:22.560
Shit.

733
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.440
Thank you. X Factor.

734
01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.520
Give me one more chance. Hello!

735
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.120
Safe travels. Oliver.

736
01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.280
Sit down.

737
01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.440
-You think I'm a fucking amateur?
-No.

738
01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.120
You know what's at stake.

739
01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.200
For all of us.

740
01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.400
In 48 hours. you'll be performing
in front of 48.000 people.

741
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.880
And you'll be the first Dane
to perform on Rocket in London.

742
01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.680
Do you realize what that can do for you?

743
01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.960
The show will give you access
to the whole world.

744
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.600
If you nail that.

745
01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.680
it'll open every door.

746
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.200
And all the crap you're dealing with

747
01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.440
will be gone.

748
01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.160
All of it.

749
01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.880
Or be friends with an idiot
and pack lobsters at the docks.

750
01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.200
Until you're killed in a fight someday.

751
01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.520
And no one goes to the funeral
because nobody knows who you are.

752
01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.480
Or

753
01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.600
you can become a star.

754
01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.400
The whole fucking world
will know your name.

755
01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.600
Difficult choice. huh?

756
01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:06.920
Fuck you.

757
01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.600
Don't waste my time. Get out.

758
01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.080
Elliott.

759
01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.360
-We need to talk.
-Talk about what?

760
01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.880
That the songs aren't good enough?

761
01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.880
That I can't hang out with Oliver?
Or no tour before I'm ready?

762
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.080
I'm pregnant.

763
01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.040
Please say something.

764
01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.840
I can't.

765
01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:42.920
No.

766
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:56.760
No!

767
01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.200
No! Let me in.

768
01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.400
Stay here.

769
01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.680
-Let go of me!
-Elliott. Take it easy.

770
01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.720
-Let me go!
-Take it easy.

771
01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.720
No!

772
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.440
Dad!

773
01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.640
They're in there!

774
01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:14.520
Dad!

775
01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.560
Dad!

776
01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.480
Elliott! Elliott!

777
01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.600
THURSDAY 18TH AUGUST

ELLIOTT
MISSED CALL

779
01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.480
Elliott! Elliott!

780
01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.680
We're here. bro.

781
01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.240
Everything

782
01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:51.720
we've worked for

783
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.240
depends on you nailing this song.

784
01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.560
It's make or break. baby.

785
01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.320
I can't do it.

786
01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.120
-Sure you can. You can do this. bro.
-I can't.

787
01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.520
Of course you can.

788
01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.520
Since I met you guys.

789
01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.480
I've lost my best friend.

790
01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.560
my job.

791
01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.840
my boat. my fucking home.

792
01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:19.000
So stop talking to me
like I'm a fucking child!

793
01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:22.800
Sure.

794
01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:25.640
That's great.

795
01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.120
-What else?
-Shut up.

796
01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.520
-What?
-Shut up.

797
01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:32.760
Hey. look at me.

798
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I never had a family of my own.
Do you understand?

799
01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:38.520
Like you.

800
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.160
All I have is the music.

801
01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.680
Bro.

802
01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.040
I bet everything on this.

803
01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.360
Understand?

804
01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.920
I'm not a star like you.

805
01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:56.520
I'm not.

806
01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.360
But I have the music.

807
01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.120
And I have my family.

808
01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.800
They are my family.

809
01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:07.200
You know what?
They're your family too. man.

810
01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.480
-My family died years ago.
-No.

811
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.440
Don't say that. Suz is your family.

812
01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.320
I'm your family.

813
01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:20.920
You and Lilly?
You two are a family now as well.

814
01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.880
Do you understand?
Can you get that into your head?

815
01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.160
Hey.

816
01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:39.040
We've all lost something.

817
01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.320
We have.

818
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.040
There's only one thing that's worse.

819
01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.000
Losing the fear of losing again.

820
01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.520
Don't do it.

821
01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:56.400
Okay?

822
01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:28.880
Why are you here?

823
01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.240
I didn't pick up the night Dad called

824
01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:47.080
because the last time I did.
and the time before.

825
01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.680
there were other women.

826
01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.920
I was afraid
that if I picked up the phone…

827
01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.840
he'd tell me it was over.

828
01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.120
So I let it ring.

829
01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.120
Why didn't you tell me?

830
01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:14.720
You loved him.
I didn't want to take that from you.

831
01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.120
It wasn't Dad calling you.

832
01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:37.720
That night.

833
01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.280
It was me.

834
01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.320
From his hotel room.

835
01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.280
-I'd gone there to look for him.
-Lilly.

836
01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:52.800
I didn't make it.

837
01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.760
The only thing I could think of…

838
01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.560
The only thing I needed…

839
01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.680
was my mom.

840
01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.480
You weren't there.

841
01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.960
And I've missed him so much.

842
01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.680
I miss you so much. Mom.

843
01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.160
My darling.

844
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
What's he doing?

845
01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:41.120
