00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.481
(uplifting music)

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:36.578
(soft piano music)

6
00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:42.042
- (Narrator) Every now and
then we get a little lost.

7
00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.752
We expect people in our
circle to elevate us.

8
00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:47.630
Yet sometimes our expectations
are so high that we're led

9
00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:51.051
down a path much. much darker.
(person sobbing)

10
00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:54.304
(hiphop music starts)

11
00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.843
Call it fate. destiny.
whatever you want to.

12
00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.762
One thing was for sure.

13
00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:39.557
my life changed forever
the day he walked into it.

14
00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.602
(soft ominous music)

15
00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:48.858
(knocking on door)

16
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.236
- I'm almost done. I swear.

17
00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:55.365
- Damn. you look beautiful.

18
00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:58.201
- You sure?

19
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.791
(phone vibrating)

20
00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:11.589
(soft music continues)

21
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:12.340
Just go.

22
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.218
- You sure?

23
00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:19.139
- I mean. Mike already walked.

24
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.224
It's been pretty quiet
around here lately.

25
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.475
I'll be fine.

26
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:29.107
(lips smacking softly)

27
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.942
- Promise to call you
when my flight lands.

28
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.485
- Have a safe trip.

29
00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:35.780
- What is taking you so -

30
00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.242
- I was just leaving.

31
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.202
- Yes you were. sorry.

32
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:45.373
Oh. my.

33
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.335
Look at you!

34
00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.797
Yes. you look beautiful. girl.

35
00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:53.548
Yes!

36
00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:58.136
You know you don't need
validation from him. right?

37
00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.513
- I know. I know.

38
00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.349
(sighs)

39
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.559
- Yes. we need to
get going. yes.

40
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.437
You great. that's
my for it. yes!

41
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:09.773
- Where's Angel?

42
00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:12.359
She's supposed to be
here a long time ago.

43
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.694
- I told you it's
not always a friend.

44
00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.946
You know she's probably some
where at somebody's house

45
00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.198
I think.

46
00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.158
She said she had a
date earlier. so.

47
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.118
I guess that worked out.

48
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.995
But. we'll get some. baby.

49
00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.081
I have everything under control.

50
00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:27.332
Just breathe.

51
00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.834
Yes. we got a plan.

52
00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:34.923
- Nice. okay.
(laughs)

53
00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:38.468
(soul music begins)
* I know

54
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.222
* That this ain't real
* This ain't real

55
00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:45.558
* It's just a fantasy. you'll-

56
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.854
- Yo. what'd I tell you about
blowing my phone up like that.

57
00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.399
- Um. my sister. she's
gone for the weekend.

58
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.984
so we got the
place to ourselves.

59
00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.111
- That's your big emergency?

60
00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.320
- Yes!

61
00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.239
You have been gone for weeks.

62
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.365
I miss you.

63
00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.117
Let me prove it to you.

64
00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.911
(r&b music starts)

65
00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.416
(traffic flowing)

66
00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:13.336
(tense music starts)

67
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:23.138
- (Announcer) And now your host

68
00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.223
coming from backstage.

69
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:30.145
Candace Maxwell!
(audience cheering)

70
00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:33.648
(tense music continues)

71
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.818
- Candace. duck!

72
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.944
(gun fires)

73
00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:38.778
(woman screams)
(gun fires repeatedly)

74
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.197
- Oh my god. Candy!

75
00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:42.991
Candy! (sobs)

76
00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.826
She's been hit!

77
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.203
- Call an ambulance!
- She's been hit!

78
00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.121
Dammit!

79
00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.622
- He got away.

80
00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.958
- Damn it. Mike. I knew I
should have hired security.

81
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.792
Stupid!

82
00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:53.585
Dammit!

83
00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:02.010
(upbeat music starts)

84
00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:02.844
* Big moves

85
00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.721
* We bout big moves

86
00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:08.767
* Big plays. we make big plays

87
00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:15.357
(exhales forcefully)

88
00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.197
(weights clanking)

89
00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:25.075
(breathing loudly)

90
00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.287
(door creaks)

91
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.374
(dramatic music)

92
00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:40.924
(suspenseful music starts)
(gun clicks)

93
00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.567
(shoes scuffing)

94
00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:09.494
(door creaks)

95
00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.542
(sighs)

96
00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:28.430
(door creaks)

97
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.438
- Drop it.

98
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.365
(gun clanks)

99
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.491
Good boy.

100
00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:59.002
We had a bargain.

101
00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:04.299
What kind of man doesn't
keep his end of a bargain?

102
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.259
- You know for a hit man.

103
00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:08.803
you sure know how
to miss a target.

104
00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:11.931
I'm not a hitman.
I'm a businessman.

105
00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.058
And you shot me.

106
00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:16.061
- And you shot me. too.

107
00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.314
As far as I'm concerned.

108
00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:23.068
you and me are even.

109
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.238
And how the hell was I
supposed to know it was you?

110
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.407
Dressed like some goddamned bum.

111
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.785
- So I guess I signed
up for a fashion shoot.

112
00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:34.954
You said she's worth more
dead than alive. right?

113
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.123
- See. you listen.
you could have told -

114
00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:40.126
- You said she's worth more
dead than alive. right?

115
00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:42.128
Then as long as the
business is taken care of.

116
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.464
then what the fuck does
it matter how I'm dressed?

117
00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:47.008
You had one job. one
motherfucking job.

118
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.386
and that was to fucking
stay out of my way.

119
00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:50.845
- I thought you would've told me

120
00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.263
you was planning on doing
something that night.

121
00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.181
- You thought?

122
00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.015
Oh! (laughs)

123
00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:54.808
You thought!

124
00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:55.558
You don't think little man.

125
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.143
You don't fucking think.

126
00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.019
I think!

127
00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.146
- Keep your hands off me. man.

128
00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:00.939
- Or what?

129
00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:03.149
- I'm warning you. man.

130
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.317
- You warning me?

131
00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:07.237
- Keep your hands off me man.
(laughs)

132
00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.072
- You warning me?

133
00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:10.407
I'm warning you.

134
00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.492
You have 24 hours to
put 50 K in my account.

135
00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:13.451
- No. that's not -

136
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.328
That's not what we agreed on.

137
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.162
50.000?

138
00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.414
- Yes. yes.

139
00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:17.997
- That's not what we
talked about. man.

140
00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.416
- Yes.

141
00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:20.750
Call it insurance.

142
00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:24.295
Write it off as
pain and suffering.

143
00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.425
I want my money -
- Fuck you and your insurance.

144
00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:29.342
(laughs)

145
00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:30.468
You want your money?

146
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.428
Huh?

147
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:32.470
You want your money?

148
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:33.304
(glass slams)

149
00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.055
Hey you go.

150
00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:36.433
Keep the change.

151
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:37.892
(hands slap)
Fuck is that. lunch money?

152
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:42.689
Look. I am not fucking. I am
not fucking playing with you.

153
00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.441
(grunts)
Yeah. look at you.

154
00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:45.483
Look at you.

155
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.277
Look at you.

156
00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:49.237
Calm down. there you go.

157
00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.614
There you go. calm down.
- Get your hands off me. man.

158
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:54.409
Is that a way. is that a way
you talk to your employer?

159
00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.828
- Get your -
- Hmm?

160
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.329
Hmm?

161
00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.330
(struggles to speak)

162
00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.623
- Listen -
- What?

163
00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.500
I want to hear it. what?
- If you want your money -

164
00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:03.293
- Huh?

165
00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:04.210
I can't hear you.

166
00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:05.837
- Double it!

167
00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:06.588
- Ah!

168
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.049
(gasps for breath)

169
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.716
Good.

170
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.051
- You want your -

171
00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:12.177
- Very good.

172
00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:14.220
(coughs loudly)

173
00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:15.597
- If you want your money.

174
00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:17.349
- Huh?

175
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.183
- Finish the job. man.

176
00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.434
Okay?

177
00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:21.770
I double. (breaths
deeply) all right?

178
00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:23.855
I double it.

179
00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.398
- That's why I like to hear.

180
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.693
That's exactly what
I like to hear.

181
00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.112
You know. Mike?

182
00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:33.865
Hey. hey!

183
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.284
Look at me.

184
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.871
The quickest way for
a man to lose his life

185
00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:43.249
is to forget he has one to live.

186
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.378
(Mike breaths deeply)

187
00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:48.672
I like you.

188
00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.174
I like you a lot. Mike.

189
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.595
So I brought you a gift. bro.

190
00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:56.429
- Come on. man.

191
00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:57.514
Come on.

192
00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:58.640
- Calm down.

193
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.434
It's all right. brother.

194
00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:02.602
Calm down.

195
00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.104
- You wouldn't kill a cop. huh?

196
00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:08.441
Come on.
- Calm down.

197
00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:09.234
- Come on.

198
00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:13.780
- It's yours.

199
00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.200
It's a token of my appreciation.

200
00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.160
Here you go.

201
00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:22.664
- Damn!

202
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.291
You out your
goddamned mind. man.

203
00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.919
(laughs loudly)

204
00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:35.593
You are out your goddamned mind.

205
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:36.803
Whose finger is that. man?

206
00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.723
(continues laughing)

207
00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.683
- Just be happy it's not yours.

208
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.103
24 hours. 50 K.

209
00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:49.024
Have a good day. Mike.

210
00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:05.248
- I have to tell you something.

211
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.209
(soft music begins)

212
00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.674
- Are you?

213
00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.968
- Hmm (laughs)

214
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.680
So. now that I
have you to myself.

215
00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:24.059
We can finally start
being a family.

216
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.520
- Listen. something I
need to talk to you about.

217
00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:30.023
- What baby. you
full of surprises.

218
00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:30.857
What is it?

219
00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:35.695
- Down payment on
the condo. car.

220
00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:38.031
I don't care what you
do with the money.

221
00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:40.408
- Oh. baby you is so sweet.

222
00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:45.872
Hold on. a condo?

223
00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.875
I thought we was getting
a place together.

224
00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:51.544
You said that you called it off.

225
00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.338
- I can't keep sneaking around.

226
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.006
I had a change of heart. and -

227
00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:57.050
- And this is what
I'm worth to you?

228
00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:59.636
You think that you can come
give some bullshit sob story

229
00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:00.720
and that's just gonna be it?

230
00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.222
You get to have a
change of heart?

231
00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:04.349
You don't get to have
a change of heart

232
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.059
when I'm carrying your child.

233
00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:08.269
- Listen.

234
00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:12.524
I know you're upset. but I ain't
even know you was pregnant.

235
00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.402
And I never said I wouldn't
help you take care of the baby.

236
00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.736
I just.

237
00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.030
- As long as this baby is
breathing in the same air

238
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:22.450
as his daddy. you gonna
be seeing me all right.

239
00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:24.786
- Listen.

240
00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.496
I'm getting married to Candace.

241
00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:28.415
Wedding's in a couple weeks.

242
00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:29.249
End of story.

243
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.793
(hand slapping)

244
00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:35.046
Oh. don't call my phone again.

245
00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:37.716
- Sean. wait.

246
00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.885
(sad piano music)

247
00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:43.763
- (Candace) I heard it'll
be lonely at the top.

248
00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:46.766
but I never considered
myself to be at the top.

249
00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:51.479
Shit. I had bigger hopes
and dreams. real plans.

250
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:52.689
(upbeat music begins)

251
00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:57.819
* Bad girl boss. drip

252
00:12:58.737 --> 00:12:59.654
* Bad girl boss. drip

253
00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:02.282
* I keep it 100 365

254
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:04.951
* Spot a bad girls and
they down to ride

255
00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.704
* CEO. I was born to shine

256
00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:10.123
* I'm a girl boss 'til I die

257
00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:12.751
* I got the ice.
I got the crib

258
00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.712
* I got my day one
girls in the whip

259
00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:18.298
* I got the cash.
I got the hits

260
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.217
* And you're going to need
a bucket for all this drip

261
00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:26.348
* Bad girl boss drip
(music trails off)

262
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.606
(fist knocking)

263
00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:40.487
(knocking continues)

264
00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:43.239
(sad piano music)

265
00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:51.748
(birds chirping)
(wind rustling)

266
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.878
(tense music begins)
(sighs loudly)

267
00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.549
- Bro!

268
00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:02.592
What the hell. man?

269
00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:04.052
- Hey man. you jumpy bro.

270
00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:07.013
You was up last night watching
all them scary movies again?

271
00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:10.016
- First off. you talking about
the Michael Myers collection?

272
00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.726
That's classic man.

273
00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:12.894
Shit never gets old.

274
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.522
- Ah. man. scared.
- Hold on. hold on.

275
00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:16.815
How'd you get in my house. man?

276
00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.858
- Your back door unlocked.

277
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.944
Man. anybody could
have gotten in here.

278
00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.990
(lock rattles)

279
00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:31.162
(door slams)

280
00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:42.048
Hey bro. listen though.

281
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.842
I'm thinking about
what you said.

282
00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.760
I'm always on the road.

283
00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.429
and I need somebody
to look after Candace.

284
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:48.555
you know. just in case.

285
00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:52.851
- I told you. you don't
need no bodyguard.

286
00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:56.187
You know how much
money you'd be wasting?

287
00:14:57.272 --> 00:15:01.276
- Look bro. appreciate
everything you've done.

288
00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:04.612
(touching piano music)

289
00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:07.157
Hey. I thought I lost you. bro.

290
00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.910
Candace thought
she'd lost you. too.

291
00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.787
She might be my wife. though.

292
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:13.913
- I feel you bro.

293
00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:16.166
- Man. I'd do anything
to protect her.

294
00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.126
Don't matter the cost.

295
00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:19.794
Listen. the reason
why I'm over here?

296
00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:21.296
It's Angel. bro.

297
00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:23.798
- You gonna be
seeing me. all right.

298
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.550
- I told you about
that chick. man.

299
00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:27.969
The moment she came sniffing
around you. what did I say?

300
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.554
Gotti. Gotti.

301
00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:30.430
That's what I said.

302
00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:32.849
What blows my mind?

303
00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:33.892
Why do you insist
to hang with chicks

304
00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.101
who are lower than
your standards.

305
00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:36.811
When you got one
that exceeds it. bro.

306
00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:39.230
- I know.
- Tell me that. come on.

307
00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:41.900
- Caught up in the
moment. I guess. man.

308
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.109
- This guy.

309
00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:44.277
- I know. I always been
a player all my life.

310
00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:46.613
- You a player now. this guy.

311
00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:47.447
- You. you know me!

312
00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:48.114
- You a player. bro.

313
00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:49.949
- You know me. man.

314
00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:51.826
- I get you that. you
was not for a second.

315
00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:53.286
I get I you that bro. (laughs)

316
00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:54.954
- It's cool though. I can't
let Angel get in the way

317
00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:56.289
with what me and Candace got.

318
00:15:56.331 --> 00:16:00.585
I know she can't have kids
but Candace is special.

319
00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:05.298
- Say less bro.

320
00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:09.135
Let big baby bro handle
as always. all right?

321
00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:09.969
- Appreciate you bro.

322
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:10.887
- I got you.

323
00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:11.930
All right?

324
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.139
(hands slapping)

325
00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.432
- I appreciate you bro.

326
00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:15.809
- Absolutely.
- I gotta make a play though.

327
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.727
- Yeah?
- I'll hit you up later.

328
00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.437
- All right. brother.

329
00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:21.856
- Oh. hey.

330
00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:24.526
You'll know when
it's dealt with.

331
00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.236
(door opens)

332
00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.488
(door creaks and closes)

333
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.491
Hey. don't forget
to lock your door!

334
00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:33.910
(door closes)

335
00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:36.579
(doorbell rings)
(fist knocking)

336
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:37.997
- Who is it?

337
00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:41.626
(suspenseful music)

338
00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:44.504
- We got a call about
a domestic dispute?

339
00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:45.755
- You got the wrong house.

340
00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:48.174
- No. I'm pretty sure
I got the right house.

341
00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:49.801
Mind if I come in. take a look?

342
00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:52.804
- Um.

343
00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.433
okay. come on.

344
00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:57.642
Persistent huh?

345
00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:03.273
I really should be careful. man.

346
00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:05.150
- Anyone else here?

347
00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.193
- No. like I told you.
everything is good.

348
00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.820
Y'all had calls in
the neighborhood?

349
00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:09.863
- No.

350
00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:10.697
- Whoa!

351
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:13.324
(scuffling)

352
00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.909
(grunts)

353
00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.036
- Ah!

354
00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:19.205
(bodies struggling)

355
00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.879
- Right now.
(grunts)

356
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.631
(gasping for air)

357
00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:37.182
(breaths deeply)

358
00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:40.310
(suspenseful music)

359
00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:01.456
(body dragging)

360
00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.923
(fist knocking)

361
00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:12.592
- Hey you!
(knocking continues)

362
00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:13.385
Open up!

363
00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:19.474
(door squeaks)

364
00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:20.350
- Bro. I quit.

365
00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:22.227
I can't deliver no more flowers.

366
00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:25.647
I ain't deliver no
more flowers. bro.

367
00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:26.481
- What happened?

368
00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.274
- Bro. do you know who this is?

369
00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.110
This Candace fucking Maxwell. G.

370
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:31.778
Girl worth over a
billion dollars.

371
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.406
and dude paying 10 bands
just to be a bodyguard.

372
00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:37.283
Shit. gimme a thousand.
I'll fight them like a pro.

373
00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:42.872
Oh. shit!

374
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.083
Bro. what the hell
happened here?

375
00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.543
Did you do that?

376
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.086
- Calm down.

377
00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:49.963
- Bro. did you do that?

378
00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:51.464
- Calm down.

379
00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:53.174
- I mean if you did I ain't
gonna nobody. I ain't no snitch.

380
00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:55.385
- Look man. it's time
for you to go. okay?

381
00:18:55.427 --> 00:18:56.970
- Bro. I can help you with that.

382
00:18:57.012 --> 00:18:58.096
- Time for you go. man.

383
00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.806
- Bro. I can help you with this.

384
00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:00.765
(door slams)

385
00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:02.308
Bro. let me help you with this.

386
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.560
- You too young. man.

387
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:04.269
- Young?

388
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.146
Bro. I'm 21 years old.

389
00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:07.814
I can buy alcohol. I'm legal.

390
00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:21.244
- Grab both feet.

391
00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.832
(lock snicks)

392
00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.795
(birds chirping)

393
00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:35.258
(uplifting choral music)

394
00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:46.353
- Hey girl!

395
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.730
How you been?

396
00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:49.731
- I'm all right.

397
00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:50.732
- What's wrong?

398
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.902
- This damn Candace
running me crazy.

399
00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:58.656
- Oh. I told you. you cannot
worry about your children.

400
00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:01.117
How long are you gonna
be mad at this girl?

401
00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:03.119
- Until she comes to her senses.

402
00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:04.579
Sean is a disaster.

403
00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:08.166
And I know they
were cute at first.

404
00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:11.169
but now they're not
even compatible anymore.

405
00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:13.213
She's not even happy.

406
00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.215
- Can't buy nobody's happiness.

407
00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:16.424
They got to want it.

408
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.220
That girl almost lost her life.

409
00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.680
Cut her some slack.

410
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.391
- Girl. he is
nothing but a player.

411
00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.810
And he puts his hands on her.

412
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.228
How do you think I don't know.

413
00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:29.729
- Have you seen any bruises?

414
00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:30.522
How do you know?

415
00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:34.693
You know I live with them.

416
00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:37.362
That boy ain't put his
finger on that girl.

417
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:42.867
You know. you got to stop
with all these accusations.

418
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.494
I know you can't stand him.

419
00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:47.247
However. if I were you.

420
00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:50.250
I would stop trying to
live my child's life.

421
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.877
You'll push her into
the arms of another man.

422
00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:56.047
and. and it'll be
worse than that.

423
00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:00.427
Speaking of that. I got to go.

424
00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:01.261
- Where you going?

425
00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.345
- I got a date.

426
00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:04.347
- I can't do nothing with you.

427
00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:05.515
- I see you

428
00:21:05.557 --> 00:21:06.558
- All right.
- Thank you.

429
00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.184
Love you. too. take care.

430
00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:10.020
- You a mess.

431
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.397
(birds chirping)

432
00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:15.984
(intense music building)

433
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:23.074
(siren blares)

434
00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:37.339
(grumbles)

435
00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:41.134
(suspenseful music)

436
00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:42.427
- Ah!

437
00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:44.763
(tires squealing)

438
00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:46.181
(screams loudly)

439
00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:48.016
(car thumps)

440
00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:49.851
- Oh my god. holy shit!

441
00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:56.608
Someone please come and help me!

442
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.155
(tires squealing)

443
00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:05.700
(tense music fading out)

444
00:22:10.205 --> 00:22:14.292
(romantic music begins)

445
00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:17.337
- All right. so. what's wrong?

446
00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:18.755
- Is this cold?

447
00:22:20.924 --> 00:22:22.258
- It's my favorite part.

448
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.845
- Did you forget I do
not like cold food?

449
00:22:29.307 --> 00:22:30.809
You know we don't
do anything anymore.

450
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.894
You haven't took
me out in months.

451
00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:35.063
(cellphone vibrates)

452
00:22:35.105 --> 00:22:36.606
- Let me get you something else.

453
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.531
(tense music)

454
00:22:56.751 --> 00:22:57.919
Hey.

455
00:22:57.961 --> 00:22:58.670
- What?

456
00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:02.215
- Dance with me.

457
00:23:02.257 --> 00:23:03.550
(sensual music)

458
00:23:03.591 --> 00:23:08.138
- Our thing. look at you
being all considerate.

459
00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:08.972
So babe.

460
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.768
I was thinking that maybe I
should just cancel the event

461
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:17.313
since you weren't
going to be there.

462
00:23:17.355 --> 00:23:18.523
- All right.

463
00:23:18.565 --> 00:23:20.066
That's what I need
to talk to you about.

464
00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:24.237
I'm in the process of
hiring a body guard.

465
00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:26.448
I think I might have
found a perfect guy.

466
00:23:29.034 --> 00:23:29.826
- Why?

467
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:38.251
Reese dropped this
off a little while ago

468
00:23:38.293 --> 00:23:39.836
before she went on her date.

469
00:23:39.878 --> 00:23:42.172
I feel safe carrying
that around.

470
00:23:42.213 --> 00:23:43.340
- Is thing loaded?

471
00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:44.466
You even know how
to use this thing?

472
00:23:44.507 --> 00:23:47.427
- I scheduled a session
at the gun range.

473
00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:49.596
and I'll learn how to use it.

474
00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:52.557
- Man. I had holes in my
drugs bigger than this thing.

475
00:23:53.808 --> 00:23:55.310
The best thing you can
do is scare somebody off.

476
00:23:55.352 --> 00:23:57.437
- How do you expect me
to get anything done

477
00:23:57.479 --> 00:24:00.690
with someone watching my
every move over my shoulder.

478
00:24:00.732 --> 00:24:02.609
If anything. I'd rather
have my man there with me

479
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.110
at all my events.

480
00:24:07.113 --> 00:24:08.073
- Babe.

481
00:24:08.114 --> 00:24:10.158
you've had thousands of events.

482
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.285
I'm sure you'll have tons more.

483
00:24:12.327 --> 00:24:14.162
I promise I'll be
at the next one.

484
00:24:16.331 --> 00:24:18.625
Just do you. and
I'm gonna do me.

485
00:24:18.667 --> 00:24:20.502
Let your man take care of you.

486
00:24:21.419 --> 00:24:23.713
That's what husband's
supposed to do.

487
00:24:23.755 --> 00:24:27.801
- (sighs) Fine.
events only though.

488
00:24:31.554 --> 00:24:34.474
- All right now. get your
fine ass in the next room.

489
00:24:34.516 --> 00:24:37.894
(hand slaps)

490
00:24:37.936 --> 00:24:40.522
(door knocks)

491
00:24:44.025 --> 00:24:45.360
What you doing here?

492
00:24:45.402 --> 00:24:47.654
(muffled speaking)

493
00:24:47.696 --> 00:24:50.073
- Seven-o-clock at night?

494
00:24:50.115 --> 00:24:52.492
Give me a chance to introduce
the idea to her first.

495
00:24:52.534 --> 00:24:54.244
- Who's at the door. babe?

496
00:24:54.285 --> 00:24:55.328
- One sec.

497
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.622
Man. it's just a neighbor.

498
00:25:06.339 --> 00:25:09.509
Man. presentation is everything.

499
00:25:09.551 --> 00:25:11.720
You dressed like you going
out for a late night run.

500
00:25:13.346 --> 00:25:14.556
- My job is to protect.

501
00:25:15.807 --> 00:25:17.684
My resume speaks for itself.

502
00:25:19.394 --> 00:25:20.687
- You're a hitman.

503
00:25:22.397 --> 00:25:23.565
- I'm a contractor.

504
00:25:24.399 --> 00:25:25.650
- Same thing.

505
00:25:27.527 --> 00:25:29.029
- There's a dark color sedan

506
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:32.323
that's been circling the
property since I arrived.

507
00:25:32.365 --> 00:25:33.825
In life.

508
00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:35.410
we have to choose whether
we want our problems

509
00:25:35.452 --> 00:25:37.579
to be permanent or temporary.

510
00:25:38.413 --> 00:25:39.748
But the choice. Mr. Rivers.

511
00:25:40.582 --> 00:25:42.125
is always yours.

512
00:25:43.209 --> 00:25:44.461
- Sean. don't be rude.

513
00:25:44.502 --> 00:25:47.339
You gonna introduce me
to your handsome friend?

514
00:25:49.007 --> 00:25:52.552
- Aunt V. this isn't
the time. hit the hay.

515
00:25:52.594 --> 00:25:54.596
- Hit the hay?

516
00:25:54.637 --> 00:25:56.598
I don't smoke that stuff.

517
00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.560
- Enjoy the rest of your night.

518
00:26:00.602 --> 00:26:02.604
I'll take care of it.

519
00:26:11.446 --> 00:26:14.115
(lock clicks)

520
00:26:17.869 --> 00:26:21.790
(sensual music begins)

521
00:26:21.831 --> 00:26:22.374
- Sean?

522
00:26:24.417 --> 00:26:26.044
Sean?

523
00:26:26.086 --> 00:26:27.587
(snoring)

524
00:26:27.629 --> 00:26:28.630
Sean. Sean?

525
00:26:33.176 --> 00:26:35.553
(record scratches)

526
00:26:35.595 --> 00:26:38.306
(pillow slaps)

527
00:26:40.141 --> 00:26:41.184
(loud snores)

528
00:26:41.226 --> 00:26:42.686
- My great aunt
Vanessa always said

529
00:26:42.727 --> 00:26:45.313
a woman could think better
on her feet than on her back

530
00:26:45.355 --> 00:26:46.606
with her legs in the air.

531
00:26:46.648 --> 00:26:48.692
And that loving a man more
than you love yourself

532
00:26:48.733 --> 00:26:50.610
stunts your eternal growth.

533
00:26:50.652 --> 00:26:54.114
(upbeat music)

534
00:26:54.155 --> 00:26:56.658
(meat sizzling)

535
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.661
(liquid gurgling)

536
00:27:02.914 --> 00:27:06.292
- What could she
possibly see in him?

537
00:27:06.334 --> 00:27:07.460
- She's in deep now.

538
00:27:07.502 --> 00:27:09.087
It could be the money.

539
00:27:09.129 --> 00:27:12.966
- I know your handicapped ass
isn't out here clout chasing.

540
00:27:13.008 --> 00:27:14.342
- Girl. people have
been sending me

541
00:27:14.384 --> 00:27:16.845
all types of gifts and cash
app since that happened.

542
00:27:16.886 --> 00:27:18.346
It's only been a couple of days

543
00:27:18.388 --> 00:27:20.181
but I've already been getting
hundreds of views and likes.

544
00:27:20.223 --> 00:27:23.643
I think I'm finally starting
to get my own fan base.

545
00:27:23.685 --> 00:27:25.645
- Sometimes I wonder about you.

546
00:27:25.687 --> 00:27:27.147
For somebody
majoring in business.

547
00:27:27.188 --> 00:27:29.315
you sure don't use
your brain much.

548
00:27:29.357 --> 00:27:31.109
Everyone isn't like you.

549
00:27:31.151 --> 00:27:32.777
K. he doesn't have
money to burn.

550
00:27:32.819 --> 00:27:34.654
Candace is the one he likes.

551
00:27:34.696 --> 00:27:38.491
- Um. Sean worked very
hard to get what he has.

552
00:27:38.533 --> 00:27:40.660
You need to give
that man some credit.

553
00:27:40.702 --> 00:27:45.498
- Good credit is something
that fool will never have.

554
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.209
(shoes clicking)

555
00:27:51.504 --> 00:27:52.505
- What are you up to?

556
00:27:52.547 --> 00:27:53.256
- Nothing.

557
00:28:00.638 --> 00:28:01.890
- Angel. my God.

558
00:28:02.557 --> 00:28:04.059
How are you doing?

559
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.477
- Hey. I'm good.

560
00:28:05.518 --> 00:28:06.853
- Have they found
the driver yet?

561
00:28:06.895 --> 00:28:09.189
- No. not yet.
happened too fast.

562
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.941
- Yeah. I didn't even get
a good look at the vehicle.

563
00:28:11.983 --> 00:28:14.611
- Hmm. what did you expect?

564
00:28:14.652 --> 00:28:15.862
These women are getting
sick and tired of you

565
00:28:15.904 --> 00:28:17.697
running around with their men.

566
00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:18.782
Hell. I've been surprised

567
00:28:18.823 --> 00:28:20.700
that you didn't
try to hit on Sean.

568
00:28:20.742 --> 00:28:21.910
- Excuse you?

569
00:28:23.953 --> 00:28:25.497
- Anyway. um. yeah.

570
00:28:25.538 --> 00:28:27.415
you're the reason why Miss
Conwell was there last week.

571
00:28:27.457 --> 00:28:30.210
She heard about you trying
to sleep with her husband.

572
00:28:30.251 --> 00:28:31.920
- Please do not tell me

573
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:34.839
you just ruined our
relationship with Miss Conwell.

574
00:28:34.881 --> 00:28:37.842
She draws in more
clients than anyone.

575
00:28:37.884 --> 00:28:40.845
- Okay. but in my defense. he
didn't even have his ring on.

576
00:28:40.887 --> 00:28:42.722
Like. I didn't even know
that he was with the girl

577
00:28:42.764 --> 00:28:45.684
until I saw him out publicly.

578
00:28:45.725 --> 00:28:47.936
And then after that
I just cut him off!

579
00:28:47.977 --> 00:28:49.562
- Damn. you immature.

580
00:28:49.604 --> 00:28:50.689
You so damn immature.

581
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.232
If I was Candace.

582
00:28:52.273 --> 00:28:54.317
your ass would've been in an
unemployment line weeks ago.

583
00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:55.735
- Well. this is a good
thing that you not my boss.

584
00:28:55.777 --> 00:28:56.653
then. huh?

585
00:28:56.695 --> 00:28:57.862
- All right!

586
00:28:57.904 --> 00:29:00.657
- And we all know you
wanna be Candace anyway.

587
00:29:00.699 --> 00:29:02.450
- No I don't.

588
00:29:02.492 --> 00:29:04.369
I'm not the one who's an intern.

589
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:05.662
Shit. I'm my own woman.

590
00:29:05.704 --> 00:29:07.539
Something that you
could never be.

591
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.790
- All right.

592
00:29:08.832 --> 00:29:10.208
that is enough.

593
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.293
What you heifers
are not gonna do.

594
00:29:12.335 --> 00:29:15.130
is tear anything in
my goddamn house.

595
00:29:17.215 --> 00:29:23.388
Now. I decided that Angel
is going to be staying here

596
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:27.267
until she can find a
nicer place to live.

597
00:29:27.308 --> 00:29:28.518
- What?

598
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.564
- Yeah. I mean. your
neighborhood isn't safe. so.

599
00:29:32.605 --> 00:29:35.150
I asked Kim if I could stay
with her for a little while.

600
00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:36.443
- Is that right?

601
00:29:41.406 --> 00:29:45.785
- Look. you two are the
only real friends I have.

602
00:29:45.827 --> 00:29:48.204
I have so much pressure
on me right now.

603
00:29:49.414 --> 00:29:51.916
Everybody is depending on me.

604
00:29:51.958 --> 00:29:54.336
The last time me and my mom
talked. we got in an argument.

605
00:29:54.377 --> 00:29:58.214
She hasn't answered any of
my calls or my text messages.

606
00:29:59.632 --> 00:30:01.801
And I don't even have a man.

607
00:30:01.843 --> 00:30:03.762
I walked into my
bedroom the other day

608
00:30:03.803 --> 00:30:05.847
and it's like Sean's
lost interest in me.

609
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.393
I mean at least you
guys have a man.

610
00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:12.854
They enjoy being around you.

611
00:30:16.691 --> 00:30:19.986
- Well. did you
try to massage him?

612
00:30:21.613 --> 00:30:23.490
- Maybe. pop rocks.

613
00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:25.033
First you take the.

614
00:30:25.075 --> 00:30:28.536
then you take pop rocks
and put it on top.

615
00:30:28.578 --> 00:30:29.329
Nevermind.

616
00:30:30.914 --> 00:30:33.500
- Okay. have you tried
dressing up sexy?

617
00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:34.834
Men love that.

618
00:30:34.876 --> 00:30:36.795
Makes them feel like
they're cheating.

619
00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:37.879
Or. so I've heard.

620
00:30:37.921 --> 00:30:40.048
- I don't know you
bitches right now.

621
00:30:41.508 --> 00:30:42.842
- You know ladies.

622
00:30:42.884 --> 00:30:44.594
I can really use something
to take the edge off.

623
00:30:44.636 --> 00:30:46.846
- Yes. same here!

624
00:30:46.888 --> 00:30:48.139
- Drink up. ladies!

625
00:30:48.181 --> 00:30:49.224
- Oh. oh!

626
00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:51.059
- Congratulations
to my best friend

627
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:53.561
for closing your
publishing deal.

628
00:30:53.603 --> 00:30:54.979
- Yes!

629
00:30:55.021 --> 00:30:56.690
- I know people who kill to
be in your shoes right now.

630
00:30:56.731 --> 00:30:58.274
- Ain't that the truth.

631
00:30:58.316 --> 00:31:00.985
(upbeat music)

632
00:31:07.742 --> 00:31:10.412
(door knocking)

633
00:31:12.706 --> 00:31:13.665
- Q. my man.

634
00:31:14.541 --> 00:31:16.042
- Bless baby.

635
00:31:16.084 --> 00:31:18.169
- Cash. baby. come here.

636
00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:23.049
- Angel is not to
have wine. again.

637
00:31:23.091 --> 00:31:24.884
It should have me
out like a light.

638
00:31:24.926 --> 00:31:27.387
My head is still pounding.

639
00:31:27.429 --> 00:31:28.722
- This is Quincy Powell.

640
00:31:28.763 --> 00:31:29.639
Your new bodyguard.

641
00:31:29.681 --> 00:31:31.057
Call him Q cause he likes it.

642
00:31:31.099 --> 00:31:33.560
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

643
00:31:33.601 --> 00:31:36.062
Although I am surprised
that a woman of your caliber

644
00:31:36.104 --> 00:31:39.149
doesn't already have bodyguards
surrounding this place.

645
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.817
- See. I knew the day

646
00:31:40.859 --> 00:31:42.902
that my husband insinuated
that I get a bodyguard

647
00:31:42.944 --> 00:31:45.113
it was a stupid decision.

648
00:31:45.155 --> 00:31:47.282
But it's really a stupid
decision when someone like you

649
00:31:47.323 --> 00:31:50.201
come walking up in my house
talking about protecting me.

650
00:31:51.661 --> 00:31:53.747
- Okay. what's the problem?

651
00:31:53.788 --> 00:31:54.706
You don't like my attire?

652
00:31:54.748 --> 00:31:55.999
- Hell no.

653
00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:57.542
You look like you just
walked outta a refuge camp.

654
00:31:57.584 --> 00:31:59.919
You ain't going nowhere
with me looking like that.

655
00:31:59.961 --> 00:32:03.048
- (laughs) Right. like.

656
00:32:03.089 --> 00:32:05.925
Listen. where your muscles at?

657
00:32:05.967 --> 00:32:08.428
You need a strong man.

658
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:09.512
Uh-oh!

659
00:32:09.554 --> 00:32:13.308
Well. I guess he
is strong. (laughs)

660
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.518
But you still don't look
like a bodyguard. though.

661
00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.394
Just saying.

662
00:32:18.813 --> 00:32:20.273
(fist knocking on door)

663
00:32:20.315 --> 00:32:22.817
- Don't just stand
there looking stupid.

664
00:32:22.859 --> 00:32:24.444
Go get the door.

665
00:32:24.486 --> 00:32:26.446
(laughs)

666
00:32:28.948 --> 00:32:32.494
- Girl. my head is killing me.

667
00:32:32.535 --> 00:32:33.370
(door clicking)

668
00:32:33.411 --> 00:32:34.496
- Oh. we. bam!

669
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:36.956
Yo. this is nice!

670
00:32:36.998 --> 00:32:39.834
You got a Picasso. and shit.

671
00:32:39.876 --> 00:32:42.796
Oh. this is my kind
of place. this!

672
00:32:42.837 --> 00:32:45.799
Oh. sorry. this came in for you.

673
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.467
- Man. what are you doing here?

674
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:50.136
- Well. shit. what
you doing here?

675
00:32:50.178 --> 00:32:52.597
- Yo. I already told you
I hired somebody already.

676
00:32:52.639 --> 00:32:53.932
- What!

677
00:32:53.973 --> 00:32:55.934
- You aren't even going
to play me like that. bro!

678
00:32:55.975 --> 00:32:56.976
Bro. I'm the one who told you

679
00:32:57.018 --> 00:32:57.811
about the job in
the first place!

680
00:32:57.852 --> 00:32:59.062
- Shit.

681
00:32:59.104 --> 00:33:00.563
- Bro. you know I
needed to do the job.

682
00:33:00.605 --> 00:33:02.774
Otherwise my parole officer
would send my black ass

683
00:33:02.816 --> 00:33:04.109
back to the halfway house.

684
00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:05.985
- (both) Parole officer?

685
00:33:06.027 --> 00:33:07.320
- Oh hell no.

686
00:33:07.362 --> 00:33:09.614
Get his jail bait
ass out my house.

687
00:33:09.656 --> 00:33:10.365
- For real.

688
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.326
(grumbles)

689
00:33:13.368 --> 00:33:14.994
( bangs)

690
00:33:15.036 --> 00:33:15.995
- What was that?

691
00:33:16.037 --> 00:33:16.955
(door clicking)

692
00:33:16.996 --> 00:33:18.748
Y'all got a ghost or some shit?

693
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.793
(something smashing)

694
00:33:26.798 --> 00:33:29.718
(music crescendos)

695
00:33:30.927 --> 00:33:32.053
- What happened?

696
00:33:32.887 --> 00:33:33.972
- Did you get him?

697
00:33:34.014 --> 00:33:35.098
- He got away.

698
00:33:36.641 --> 00:33:38.101
- Now you see why I hired him.

699
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:41.021
- Man. you was fast as hell.

700
00:33:41.062 --> 00:33:42.856
You like a linebacker
on that ass.

701
00:33:42.897 --> 00:33:47.110
- What good are you if you're
just gonna let him get away?

702
00:33:47.152 --> 00:33:48.987
What if he comes back?

703
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:50.155
- I tried. all right?

704
00:33:51.281 --> 00:33:52.699
- As far as I'm concerned.

705
00:33:52.741 --> 00:33:55.952
neither one of you are ever
gonna step foot in here again.

706
00:33:55.994 --> 00:33:58.204
I'll hire my own damn bodyguard.

707
00:33:59.873 --> 00:34:00.707
- Don't mind her.

708
00:34:01.916 --> 00:34:04.878
I can't let her stay in
here by herself again.

709
00:34:04.919 --> 00:34:06.713
That's the last thing I need.

710
00:34:06.755 --> 00:34:09.924
I got some business I need
to take care of tonight.

711
00:34:09.966 --> 00:34:11.176
Can you stay with her?

712
00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:13.845
- Yeah.

713
00:34:13.887 --> 00:34:14.971
- Hold up. what about me?
- I can stay.

714
00:34:15.013 --> 00:34:16.431
- Me?

715
00:34:16.473 --> 00:34:18.433
Same me was standing behind
me shaking like a leaf.

716
00:34:19.684 --> 00:34:21.186
Man. you little scary ass
can't protect yourself.

717
00:34:21.227 --> 00:34:22.437
let alone my wife.

718
00:34:22.479 --> 00:34:25.899
- In all honesty. Derek
is actually a good guy.

719
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.901
And besides I can
use an assistant.

720
00:34:27.942 --> 00:34:29.694
I'm sure if something
happens again.

721
00:34:29.736 --> 00:34:32.280
he'll be there to
help me take him down.

722
00:34:32.322 --> 00:34:32.906
Right?

723
00:34:32.947 --> 00:34:33.948
- Please man.

724
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.908
I can be a good cook.

725
00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:36.076
I can do laundry.

726
00:34:36.117 --> 00:34:37.744
I can take the dog for a walk.

727
00:34:37.786 --> 00:34:39.079
I can even watch the kid.

728
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.246
Come on.

729
00:34:40.288 --> 00:34:41.456
I can be very
useful around here.

730
00:34:41.498 --> 00:34:42.999
Look. you ain't even
gotta pay me 10 stack.

731
00:34:43.041 --> 00:34:44.626
Just pay me four. we good.

732
00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.671
- Four for what you just did?

733
00:34:47.712 --> 00:34:48.421
How about three?

734
00:34:49.923 --> 00:34:51.800
- And a half? Three and a half.

735
00:34:53.051 --> 00:34:56.721
- Listen. we don't
even have any kids.

736
00:34:56.763 --> 00:34:58.056
but for that much.

737
00:34:58.098 --> 00:35:00.934
I want you help Reese
with whatever she needs.

738
00:35:00.975 --> 00:35:03.103
That'll take stress off Candace.

739
00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:04.187
- I'll help Reese for free.

740
00:35:04.229 --> 00:35:05.772
Just let me know
what I need to do.

741
00:35:05.814 --> 00:35:08.400
(lips smacking)

742
00:35:13.405 --> 00:35:15.740
- Bring your little scary ass.

743
00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:20.286
(door clicking)

744
00:35:21.454 --> 00:35:23.415
(sighs)

745
00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:28.920
(door clicking)

746
00:35:28.962 --> 00:35:30.463
- Girl. I'm jealous.

747
00:35:30.505 --> 00:35:32.716
Your aunt gets more
action than us.

748
00:35:32.757 --> 00:35:34.759
The hell is that about?

749
00:35:34.801 --> 00:35:36.636
- Don't be hating on me.

750
00:35:36.678 --> 00:35:38.847
I am living my best life.

751
00:35:40.348 --> 00:35:43.184
- I see Auntie. (laughs)

752
00:35:51.067 --> 00:35:53.778
(birds chirping)

753
00:35:57.907 --> 00:36:00.326
(inquisitive music)

754
00:36:00.368 --> 00:36:02.370
- He never sleeps. does he?

755
00:36:02.412 --> 00:36:04.497
- Check his records.

756
00:36:04.539 --> 00:36:07.417
He's been reprimanded multiple
times for his misconduct.

757
00:36:07.459 --> 00:36:10.003
but. all they do is
suspend him with pay

758
00:36:10.045 --> 00:36:13.340
and put him right back
on the task force.

759
00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.678
- What do you make of it?

760
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.223
- Honestly. Mrs. Evans needs
to watch the company she keeps.

761
00:36:26.811 --> 00:36:29.689
(music fades away)

762
00:36:39.783 --> 00:36:40.867
- Officer Miller.

763
00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:42.285
- Mind if we have a word?

764
00:36:43.078 --> 00:36:43.745
- Sure.

765
00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.748
- I doubt Lieutenant Gladstone
will be happy to learn

766
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.375
that two of his best
guys are out here

767
00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:49.542
committing more felonies

768
00:36:49.584 --> 00:36:52.379
than the convicts
they put behind bars.

769
00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.714
- A little birdie told us
that you and Officer River

770
00:36:54.756 --> 00:36:58.051
have been very.
very close lately.

771
00:36:58.093 --> 00:36:59.469
- Your birdie must be on crack

772
00:36:59.511 --> 00:37:01.137
'cause there's no way I would -

773
00:37:01.179 --> 00:37:03.264
- Oh. you have fucked up. now.

774
00:37:03.306 --> 00:37:04.683
- Look. tell us the truth.

775
00:37:04.724 --> 00:37:06.226
- I am!

776
00:37:06.267 --> 00:37:10.105
- We've got a female
officer that's been missing

777
00:37:10.146 --> 00:37:11.272
for almost a week.

778
00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:14.192
And I've got
something to tell you.

779
00:37:14.234 --> 00:37:16.861
Officer Rivers is
not untouchable.

780
00:37:16.903 --> 00:37:19.364
So I would think long and hard

781
00:37:19.406 --> 00:37:22.117
if you're willing to
leave behind a beautiful -

782
00:37:22.158 --> 00:37:24.369
- Young wife

783
00:37:24.411 --> 00:37:27.163
that could potentially
get her back blown out

784
00:37:27.205 --> 00:37:29.416
while you sit there and
piss and rot in jail.

785
00:37:29.457 --> 00:37:31.960
- All right. but
I want protection.

786
00:37:33.169 --> 00:37:35.422
You don't know what this
guy's put me through.

787
00:37:35.463 --> 00:37:37.257
He's got this tape of me.

788
00:37:37.298 --> 00:37:38.425
- Of what?

789
00:37:39.259 --> 00:37:40.593
- I'd rather not say.

790
00:37:40.635 --> 00:37:42.971
but I will say if my wife
saw it. she would leave me.

791
00:37:47.434 --> 00:37:50.353
He knew I had this thing
for Candace Maxwell.

792
00:37:50.395 --> 00:37:53.231
And he got all this
material that I had of her

793
00:37:53.273 --> 00:37:55.525
and paid me to break
into her house.

794
00:37:55.567 --> 00:37:57.819
- Wait. he put out
the hit on her life?

795
00:37:58.987 --> 00:38:00.238
- Why?

796
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.074
- I don't know. but I
couldn't go through with it.

797
00:38:03.116 --> 00:38:05.285
And I tried to tell her but she
just got scared and ran off.

798
00:38:05.326 --> 00:38:07.829
I mean. I was wearing
a mask and everything.

799
00:38:09.164 --> 00:38:09.956
But.

800
00:38:12.167 --> 00:38:14.127
I. I didn't want to
show my face 'cause

801
00:38:14.169 --> 00:38:15.837
I thought she would turn me in.

802
00:38:17.255 --> 00:38:20.091
- Well at least your wife
won't see these tapes.

803
00:38:20.133 --> 00:38:21.634
- Because you are
going to help us

804
00:38:21.676 --> 00:38:24.095
put away this psycho for life.

805
00:38:24.137 --> 00:38:25.930
Before he ruins more lives.

806
00:38:25.972 --> 00:38:30.560
Otherwise. we'll do more
than expose you to your wife.

807
00:38:33.188 --> 00:38:36.358
(crickets chirping)

808
00:38:43.907 --> 00:38:45.658
- Hey. can I talk
to you for a moment?

809
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.328
- What part of leave -
Have you lost your mind?

810
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.497
- No. I miss you too!

811
00:38:50.538 --> 00:38:52.290
- I'm getting married
to your brother.

812
00:38:52.332 --> 00:38:53.375
- Ah. Sean.

813
00:38:56.294 --> 00:38:57.796
- What is wrong with you?

814
00:38:57.837 --> 00:39:02.342
Whatever you think we
have. forget about it.

815
00:39:02.384 --> 00:39:04.511
- I miss you. too.

816
00:39:04.552 --> 00:39:05.887
- I'm getting married
to your brother.

817
00:39:05.929 --> 00:39:07.347
- Ah. yes. Sean.

818
00:39:07.389 --> 00:39:09.099
You know you can't
even do this. right?

819
00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:09.933
(gasps)

820
00:39:09.974 --> 00:39:10.767
You know that.

821
00:39:10.809 --> 00:39:11.601
(door clicks)

822
00:39:11.643 --> 00:39:12.227
- Babe?

823
00:39:12.268 --> 00:39:13.395
Sorry I'm late.

824
00:39:14.896 --> 00:39:15.647
You all right?

825
00:39:17.357 --> 00:39:19.150
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

826
00:39:19.192 --> 00:39:20.318
- What's he doing here?

827
00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.237
- Tell him what I'm doing here.

828
00:39:22.278 --> 00:39:23.405
Huh?

829
00:39:24.239 --> 00:39:26.032
Came over to talk
to Candace. bro.

830
00:39:26.991 --> 00:39:28.243
She was nervous about
the wedding. man.

831
00:39:28.284 --> 00:39:29.703
She has some doubts.

832
00:39:29.744 --> 00:39:33.748
- Ah. whatever doubts you
think I have. they're gone now.

833
00:39:35.709 --> 00:39:37.711
- She think you cheating on her
man. 'cause you always gone.

834
00:39:37.752 --> 00:39:38.461
- What?

835
00:39:39.504 --> 00:39:40.463
- Mike. stop it!

836
00:39:40.505 --> 00:39:41.923
Get the hell outta my house.

837
00:39:47.762 --> 00:39:50.473
You sure you wanna leave
me here with all these men?

838
00:39:52.267 --> 00:39:53.560
- What can they do?

839
00:39:53.601 --> 00:39:55.395
You got all these witnesses
living around anyway.

840
00:39:55.437 --> 00:39:57.313
You didn't even ask me
to put my permission

841
00:39:57.355 --> 00:39:59.941
for you to hide your
intern and stay with us.

842
00:39:59.983 --> 00:40:03.069
- For some reason. I
feel like her situation

843
00:40:03.111 --> 00:40:04.696
is my responsibility.

844
00:40:04.738 --> 00:40:06.197
I should have been
looking out for her.

845
00:40:06.239 --> 00:40:09.075
And she needs a place to stay
until she gets on her feet.

846
00:40:09.117 --> 00:40:10.493
- That's a grown ass woman.

847
00:40:10.535 --> 00:40:12.746
You barely even know her.

848
00:40:15.457 --> 00:40:17.083
- Everything is secure.

849
00:40:17.125 --> 00:40:22.297
If you don't mind. we need
to make a few changes.

850
00:40:22.339 --> 00:40:25.467
Anybody can walk
up to the house.

851
00:40:26.301 --> 00:40:27.635
Whatever. sir.

852
00:40:43.068 --> 00:40:45.779
(lighthearted music)
(knuckles knocking)

853
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:46.404
- Girl!

854
00:40:46.446 --> 00:40:47.322
You look ten -

855
00:40:47.364 --> 00:40:50.825
(door slamming)

856
00:40:50.867 --> 00:40:53.620
(knob jiggling)

857
00:40:57.832 --> 00:41:00.251
(door clicking)

858
00:41:04.464 --> 00:41:07.467
(vibrator buzzing)

859
00:41:07.509 --> 00:41:09.761
(moaning)

860
00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:17.060
(suspenseful music)

861
00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.170
(gasps)

862
00:41:53.555 --> 00:41:55.682
* I really. really.
really. really want that

863
00:41:55.724 --> 00:41:57.517
* Good thing that
I get what I want

864
00:41:57.559 --> 00:41:59.519
* I stay balling and
my cards stay alling

865
00:41:59.561 --> 00:42:02.105
* Get your face
out of my frame

866
00:42:02.147 --> 00:42:04.441
* Everyone's stopping
when they see me copping

867
00:42:04.482 --> 00:42:07.068
* They just can't
do it the same

868
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:08.069
* What's that?

869
00:42:08.111 --> 00:42:09.821
* What's that?
* What's that?

870
00:42:09.863 --> 00:42:13.783
* Is that what I think it is?

871
00:42:15.243 --> 00:42:17.037
- What do you think about this?

872
00:42:17.078 --> 00:42:18.288
Cute. huh?

873
00:42:18.329 --> 00:42:20.832
- I think if you like
it. you should buy it.

874
00:42:20.874 --> 00:42:23.043
- You're the one
suggested coming with me.

875
00:42:23.084 --> 00:42:26.671
Usually it's Reese.
or Angel here with me.

876
00:42:27.756 --> 00:42:30.425
You know. I don't
really understand.

877
00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:32.969
I really treat people nicely.

878
00:42:33.011 --> 00:42:34.804
I do like to make
everyone happy.

879
00:42:34.846 --> 00:42:37.349
I don't understand why
anybody would wanna kill me.

880
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.142
And why the constant threats?

881
00:42:39.184 --> 00:42:40.477
- With all due respect.

882
00:42:40.518 --> 00:42:42.228
you're not quite Mother Theresa.

883
00:42:43.855 --> 00:42:47.567
- You know. growing up I
used to wanna be a nurse

884
00:42:47.609 --> 00:42:49.694
but I couldn't stand
the sight of blood.

885
00:42:50.904 --> 00:42:52.906
and I damn sure wasn't
going to scrub those toilets

886
00:42:52.947 --> 00:42:54.991
or change sheets like my mother.

887
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.120
Especially not for no white man.

888
00:43:01.122 --> 00:43:03.416
- You and your mom
don't get along?

889
00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:05.460
- She looks down
on me momentarily.

890
00:43:05.502 --> 00:43:07.921
Thinks I'm selling
my soul to the devil

891
00:43:07.962 --> 00:43:11.424
and out here selling
my body for sex.

892
00:43:11.466 --> 00:43:12.801
She's embarrassed of me.

893
00:43:15.178 --> 00:43:16.638
Although I could.

894
00:43:17.472 --> 00:43:19.349
But. that's not what I'm doing.

895
00:43:20.558 --> 00:43:24.312
I genuinely like to
make people happy.

896
00:43:24.354 --> 00:43:26.106
That's what excites me.

897
00:43:26.147 --> 00:43:29.651
- Oh. so that's why you have
everyone living with you.

898
00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.782
Other people's happiness
isn't your responsibility.

899
00:43:35.824 --> 00:43:38.118
- What's that supposed to mean?

900
00:43:38.159 --> 00:43:39.911
- I mean. you're
beautiful. intelligent -

901
00:43:39.953 --> 00:43:43.331
- You don't know a damn
thing about me. okay?

902
00:43:44.332 --> 00:43:46.710
- I know that you're
lonely and misunderstood.

903
00:43:48.503 --> 00:43:52.507
And it's been a while since
anyone made you feel special.

904
00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:54.300
You probably got cobwebs
down there right now.

905
00:43:54.342 --> 00:43:55.135
- Oh shit.

906
00:43:55.176 --> 00:43:57.137
(laughs)

907
00:44:01.891 --> 00:44:03.601
- Oh my God. Candace!

908
00:44:03.643 --> 00:44:05.145
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. back up!

909
00:44:05.186 --> 00:44:05.770
- What is your problem?

910
00:44:05.812 --> 00:44:07.397
They're just kids!

911
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.359
What are they possibly
going to do to me?

912
00:44:12.569 --> 00:44:14.404
Does anyone have a pen?

913
00:44:14.446 --> 00:44:15.572
Thank you.

914
00:44:15.613 --> 00:44:18.158
- Miss Maxwell. girl.
you look so good!

915
00:44:18.199 --> 00:44:19.451
- Thank you.

916
00:44:19.492 --> 00:44:21.286
- You know we really
appreciate you coming to speak

917
00:44:21.327 --> 00:44:22.662
at the Girl Scout event.

918
00:44:22.704 --> 00:44:23.913
The girls just loved you.

919
00:44:23.955 --> 00:44:24.706
- Aww.

920
00:44:25.582 --> 00:44:26.833
- Well we're having another one!

921
00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:28.793
You wouldn't mind
coming and talk to them

922
00:44:28.835 --> 00:44:30.503
about fame and how they
can be humble like you.

923
00:44:30.545 --> 00:44:31.713
would you?

924
00:44:31.755 --> 00:44:33.840
- I would be honored to.

925
00:44:33.882 --> 00:44:34.424
Yes!

926
00:44:42.599 --> 00:44:45.226
(calm music)

927
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.857
- Girl. these tacos are good!

928
00:44:51.775 --> 00:44:55.070
Oh. have you used those
candles I got you?

929
00:44:55.111 --> 00:44:56.279
- They stink.

930
00:44:56.321 --> 00:44:57.530
- Girl!

931
00:44:57.572 --> 00:44:58.865
They're not supposed
to smell like roses.

932
00:44:58.907 --> 00:45:00.241
They're therapeutic.

933
00:45:00.283 --> 00:45:01.576
They're supposed to
get you to relax.

934
00:45:01.618 --> 00:45:03.370
stimulate your mind.

935
00:45:03.411 --> 00:45:07.290
You're supposed to sit
around them and meditate.

936
00:45:07.332 --> 00:45:09.918
And my grandma also said that
they helped with fertility.

937
00:45:13.713 --> 00:45:16.049
Oh. all that meat
under one roof.

938
00:45:16.091 --> 00:45:18.218
Lord have mercy!

939
00:45:18.259 --> 00:45:19.386
- He's not all that.

940
00:45:20.303 --> 00:45:21.554
- Girl. you tripping.

941
00:45:21.596 --> 00:45:23.890
It seems like soon-to-be
married life got you blind

942
00:45:23.932 --> 00:45:25.225
because that man's all
that and them some.

943
00:45:26.685 --> 00:45:28.228
(murmurs affirmatively)

944
00:45:28.269 --> 00:45:31.690
- Truthfully. I feel a
lot safer with him around.

945
00:45:31.731 --> 00:45:32.982
- Who. Beavis and Butthead?

946
00:45:33.024 --> 00:45:36.027
- Shut up.
(laughs)

947
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:38.071
- What's going on. girls?

948
00:45:38.113 --> 00:45:39.572
- Okay.

949
00:45:39.614 --> 00:45:40.615
- Hi. hi.

950
00:45:40.657 --> 00:45:41.783
- Ain't no shame
in your game. huh?

951
00:45:41.825 --> 00:45:43.243
- Never have been.
never will be.

952
00:45:43.284 --> 00:45:46.413
I can't help all the
fellas following after me.

953
00:45:46.454 --> 00:45:47.205
- Okay.

954
00:45:49.582 --> 00:45:50.917
- How is she?

955
00:45:50.959 --> 00:45:56.047
- Your mother's stubborn.
but. she's gonna be okay.

956
00:45:56.089 --> 00:45:57.507
Trust me.

957
00:45:57.549 --> 00:46:00.593
She just gets so bored in the
house being all by herself.

958
00:46:00.635 --> 00:46:01.928
- That's what scares me.

959
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.889
Her being in the house
all alone by herself.

960
00:46:04.931 --> 00:46:06.307
- She'll be fine.

961
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:07.475
Just give her some time.

962
00:46:14.899 --> 00:46:16.776
- You like the new
security system I put in?

963
00:46:16.818 --> 00:46:18.069
- It's alright.

964
00:46:18.111 --> 00:46:20.238
- You need to
chill a little bit.

965
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.114
Just chill.

966
00:46:22.741 --> 00:46:25.827
(music fades away)

967
00:46:29.164 --> 00:46:31.374
- Why nobody tell me
we having a party?

968
00:46:31.416 --> 00:46:34.627
I've always dreamed of making
it with some company to match.

969
00:46:34.669 --> 00:46:37.088
- Why. thank you!

970
00:46:37.922 --> 00:46:39.758
- Damn you got some soft hands.

971
00:46:39.799 --> 00:46:41.092
- Yeah. I'm soft all over.

972
00:46:41.134 --> 00:46:43.386
- Excuse me. this isn't
the time or place for that.

973
00:46:43.428 --> 00:46:44.804
- My bad.

974
00:46:44.846 --> 00:46:46.806
- I mean. leave that boy alone
before you give him worms.

975
00:46:46.848 --> 00:46:49.100
- You need to shut up.

976
00:46:50.101 --> 00:46:51.978
I haven't even sent
him back to his mama.

977
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.897
he'll be thanking her
for giving him life.

978
00:46:53.938 --> 00:46:56.024
- Whatever. (laughs)

979
00:46:57.192 --> 00:46:58.568
- And you need to stop anyway.

980
00:46:58.610 --> 00:46:59.611
'cause you are hating.

981
00:46:59.652 --> 00:47:00.945
- I'm not hating.

982
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:05.492
(dramatic music starts)

983
00:47:06.618 --> 00:47:08.161
- Thanks for checking up on me.

984
00:47:10.705 --> 00:47:11.873
- You're welcome.

985
00:47:12.791 --> 00:47:14.668
- I was being sarcastic.

986
00:47:14.709 --> 00:47:16.378
How could you know
it's still night?

987
00:47:22.217 --> 00:47:23.885
- Because I don't give a fuck.

988
00:47:28.264 --> 00:47:31.309
(object smashes)

989
00:47:31.351 --> 00:47:33.895
(birds singing)

990
00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.444
- Be careful. you already
skating on thin ice.

991
00:47:41.486 --> 00:47:43.863
- You hit the iceberg
too. it looks like.

992
00:47:43.905 --> 00:47:45.740
- Look. I asked you to help me

993
00:47:45.782 --> 00:47:47.659
because I want the bitch gone.

994
00:47:47.701 --> 00:47:49.577
But if you can't
even handle the job.

995
00:47:49.619 --> 00:47:52.622
- If it weren't for him
right there. she'd be dead.

996
00:47:52.664 --> 00:47:53.707
I'm pulling every rabbit

997
00:47:53.748 --> 00:47:55.709
out of my motherfucking
hat right now.

998
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:57.919
Except for that
motherfucker right there.

999
00:48:07.345 --> 00:48:10.557
He's the reason she's
breathing this very second.

1000
00:48:10.598 --> 00:48:11.599
Motherfucker.

1001
00:48:13.393 --> 00:48:14.227
- Do your job.

1002
00:48:14.269 --> 00:48:15.103
- I'm going to handle business.

1003
00:48:15.145 --> 00:48:17.022
- Yeah. you gotta do something.

1004
00:48:21.484 --> 00:48:22.861
- Officer Rivers?

1005
00:48:22.902 --> 00:48:24.320
- Now's not a good time.

1006
00:48:24.362 --> 00:48:25.697
- Well. when is a
good time for you

1007
00:48:25.739 --> 00:48:28.283
to speak about your relationship
with Candace Maxwell?

1008
00:48:31.578 --> 00:48:33.747
- There is no relationship.

1009
00:48:33.788 --> 00:48:34.664
She's a good friend.

1010
00:48:35.582 --> 00:48:37.083
- My sources say different.

1011
00:48:37.959 --> 00:48:39.836
You don't have any friends.

1012
00:48:39.878 --> 00:48:42.630
In fact. no one at the
precinct likes you.

1013
00:48:45.383 --> 00:48:46.718
Internal Affairs.

1014
00:48:47.927 --> 00:48:51.473
I'm reporting on an
incident involving your own.

1015
00:48:51.514 --> 00:48:53.016
accident some months back.

1016
00:48:54.017 --> 00:48:55.352
- Yeah. suspect got away.

1017
00:48:55.393 --> 00:48:56.144
Case closed.

1018
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:58.980
- You know. this
isn't how this works.

1019
00:49:00.315 --> 00:49:05.111
It's my job to look
after upstanding
officers like yourself.

1020
00:49:06.488 --> 00:49:09.783
For Christ's sake. man. you
were nearly fucking killed.

1021
00:49:09.824 --> 00:49:11.284
Wouldn't you like to get justice

1022
00:49:11.326 --> 00:49:13.745
for you and your
so-called friend?

1023
00:49:15.914 --> 00:49:18.041
All I want to know is -
- Listen. listen.

1024
00:49:18.083 --> 00:49:19.876
I know what you know.

1025
00:49:19.918 --> 00:49:21.920
You seem to know
a lot. don't you?

1026
00:49:21.961 --> 00:49:23.880
So you probably know my lawyer.

1027
00:49:23.922 --> 00:49:25.090
Give him a call. all right?

1028
00:49:25.131 --> 00:49:26.049
I'm done. man.

1029
00:49:26.925 --> 00:49:29.594
(door clicks)

1030
00:49:44.567 --> 00:49:47.195
(ominous music)

1031
00:49:53.034 --> 00:49:55.537
- I hope you're moving back in.

1032
00:49:55.578 --> 00:49:56.913
- Why would I do that?

1033
00:49:56.955 --> 00:49:58.164
- Because it's not healthy
to live under the same roof

1034
00:49:58.206 --> 00:49:59.416
as a man that you're
sleeping with.

1035
00:49:59.457 --> 00:50:02.335
Besides. what if
Candace finds out?

1036
00:50:02.377 --> 00:50:05.213
- She's not gonna find out.
Like. mind your business. dang.

1037
00:50:06.548 --> 00:50:08.925
- Out of all the men
in the city. why him?

1038
00:50:08.967 --> 00:50:10.844
Ain't your friendship
more valuable than that?

1039
00:50:10.885 --> 00:50:11.886
- My friend?

1040
00:50:11.928 --> 00:50:14.556
That bitch is not my friend.

1041
00:50:14.597 --> 00:50:15.765
He don't even love her.

1042
00:50:15.807 --> 00:50:17.183
He loves me.

1043
00:50:17.225 --> 00:50:20.437
- And he's doing this
by showing you what?

1044
00:50:20.478 --> 00:50:22.522
- Girl. this is why I don't
have any conversations with you.

1045
00:50:22.564 --> 00:50:23.940
You don't even
understand what we got.

1046
00:50:23.982 --> 00:50:25.984
- I understand that when
a man loves a woman.

1047
00:50:26.026 --> 00:50:27.152
he shows her off.

1048
00:50:27.193 --> 00:50:29.487
He does not hide her
or his unborn baby.

1049
00:50:29.529 --> 00:50:31.698
That's something you
will never have with him.

1050
00:50:32.991 --> 00:50:33.783
- Girl.

1051
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:40.123
- What you got. your
man rolling out?

1052
00:50:40.165 --> 00:50:43.335
- Maybe it's not for you to see.

1053
00:50:43.376 --> 00:50:45.003
- If I'm on. I can
only do so much.

1054
00:50:45.045 --> 00:50:46.046
(hand slapping)

1055
00:50:46.087 --> 00:50:47.422
- Creep.

1056
00:50:47.464 --> 00:50:49.090
Get out of here!

1057
00:50:49.132 --> 00:50:52.218
(ominous music begins)

1058
00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.845
- All that shit you playing at.

1059
00:50:55.096 --> 00:50:57.891
Let's just say you
won. all right?

1060
00:50:57.932 --> 00:50:59.100
- What are you talking about?

1061
00:50:59.142 --> 00:51:00.935
- Cut the shit. man.

1062
00:51:00.977 --> 00:51:03.021
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

1063
00:51:03.063 --> 00:51:04.939
You think you can stop me?

1064
00:51:04.981 --> 00:51:06.399
Huh?

1065
00:51:06.441 --> 00:51:08.068
- You know. it just
warms my heart.

1066
00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:09.194
to watch you squirm.

1067
00:51:10.862 --> 00:51:13.073
See. I know that was you that
sent your little cop friend

1068
00:51:13.114 --> 00:51:14.324
to my place the other night.

1069
00:51:15.492 --> 00:51:16.284
I forgive you.

1070
00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:19.829
By the way. did she
give you a call?

1071
00:51:20.955 --> 00:51:21.790
I thought not.

1072
00:51:23.416 --> 00:51:26.795
You see. the best
part about this?

1073
00:51:26.836 --> 00:51:28.004
I'm gonna do something

1074
00:51:28.046 --> 00:51:29.964
that you or your lame
ass brother never could.

1075
00:51:30.006 --> 00:51:30.715
- What's that?

1076
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.760
- Make her love me.

1077
00:51:33.802 --> 00:51:36.721
- Motherfucker. are you
ready to die on this bitch?

1078
00:51:36.763 --> 00:51:38.056
Huh?

1079
00:51:38.098 --> 00:51:40.058
You ready to give
your life for hers?

1080
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:44.020
- You know. I've given
this some thought.

1081
00:51:44.062 --> 00:51:45.355
I asked myself.

1082
00:51:45.397 --> 00:51:47.941
why on God's green Earth
would this shell of a man

1083
00:51:47.982 --> 00:51:53.238
want this beautiful. brilliant.
successful woman there?

1084
00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:57.784
And then it came to me.

1085
00:51:59.786 --> 00:52:02.622
You're living in your
brother's shadow.

1086
00:52:02.664 --> 00:52:03.957
(sighs)

1087
00:52:03.998 --> 00:52:05.583
No. no. no. hear
this. hear this.

1088
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:09.295
You're living in
your brother's shadow

1089
00:52:09.337 --> 00:52:10.964
and you can't step out of it.

1090
00:52:11.006 --> 00:52:13.049
So you resort to
schoolyard games

1091
00:52:13.091 --> 00:52:15.135
because you don't have
the testicular fortitude

1092
00:52:15.176 --> 00:52:17.178
to stand up and carry
weight in this world.

1093
00:52:18.513 --> 00:52:20.390
You're nothing
more than a coward.

1094
00:52:21.391 --> 00:52:22.726
And everybody knows it.

1095
00:52:24.602 --> 00:52:27.439
So. my brother.

1096
00:52:28.231 --> 00:52:29.315
I got a job to do.

1097
00:52:30.525 --> 00:52:31.401
Have a good day.

1098
00:52:41.369 --> 00:52:45.248
- This is so nice.
I'm so proud of you!

1099
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:48.126
Look at all these
people here to see you.

1100
00:52:48.168 --> 00:52:49.627
I am so sorry your
mom is not here.

1101
00:52:49.669 --> 00:52:51.379
but. you know. she's
gonna come around.

1102
00:52:51.421 --> 00:52:53.757
We'll just keep her in prayer.

1103
00:52:53.798 --> 00:52:54.799
All right?

1104
00:52:54.841 --> 00:52:56.301
- Okay. Auntie.

1105
00:52:56.343 --> 00:52:57.677
- Okay. I'm just so -

1106
00:52:57.719 --> 00:52:59.637
- Motherfucker!
(bodies scuffling)

1107
00:52:59.679 --> 00:53:01.181
- Hey. get down!

1108
00:53:01.222 --> 00:53:02.223
- What. oh!

1109
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.268
- Stay down!

1110
00:53:07.562 --> 00:53:09.022
Stop moving!

1111
00:53:09.064 --> 00:53:09.814
Stay down!

1112
00:53:13.026 --> 00:53:14.861
(rain splashes)

1113
00:53:14.903 --> 00:53:17.364
(sad music)

1114
00:53:20.116 --> 00:53:23.328
(thunder crashes)

1115
00:53:24.079 --> 00:53:25.914
(sobs)

1116
00:53:28.166 --> 00:53:30.960
- You know. that doesn't
make the pain go away.

1117
00:53:31.002 --> 00:53:34.422
- Who the hell
asked you anything?

1118
00:53:34.464 --> 00:53:36.466
- You should know me by now.

1119
00:53:36.508 --> 00:53:39.052
I don't wait for anyone
to ask my own opinion.

1120
00:53:39.094 --> 00:53:42.263
- Well do yourself
a favor and go away.

1121
00:53:43.306 --> 00:53:45.141
- How about you do me a favor?

1122
00:53:45.183 --> 00:53:46.768
Put this knife down.

1123
00:53:48.353 --> 00:53:50.146
- Just leave me alone.

1124
00:53:50.188 --> 00:53:50.939
Leave.

1125
00:53:53.274 --> 00:53:54.401
- I'm here.

1126
00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:58.321
What's wrong?

1127
00:54:01.408 --> 00:54:02.617
- Everything.

1128
00:54:06.079 --> 00:54:07.288
- Like?

1129
00:54:09.374 --> 00:54:11.584
- Me and my mother
don't get along.

1130
00:54:14.629 --> 00:54:16.756
My friends aren't
even my friends.

1131
00:54:17.799 --> 00:54:20.635
Like. friends
understand each other.

1132
00:54:20.677 --> 00:54:21.636
They listen.

1133
00:54:21.678 --> 00:54:24.180
They genuinely
listen. they care.

1134
00:54:24.222 --> 00:54:27.475
- I'm a friend
and I'm listening.

1135
00:54:32.022 --> 00:54:33.398
I care about you. okay?

1136
00:54:35.608 --> 00:54:38.153
You have to be stronger than
what they think you are.

1137
00:54:38.194 --> 00:54:40.113
- They who?

1138
00:54:40.155 --> 00:54:41.614
- I'm just speaking in general.

1139
00:54:44.409 --> 00:54:47.328
I know anxiety and depression
get the best in you.

1140
00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:50.582
But do me a favor.

1141
00:54:51.958 --> 00:54:54.044
before you go off the deep end.

1142
00:54:55.754 --> 00:54:56.838
call me. okay?

1143
00:54:59.132 --> 00:55:00.842
We can talk about it.

1144
00:55:02.218 --> 00:55:02.969
- Alright.

1145
00:55:04.179 --> 00:55:06.389
- Come here. give me a hug.

1146
00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:11.811
I need you around. okay?

1147
00:55:13.229 --> 00:55:15.190
Who else is gonna yell at me?

1148
00:55:15.231 --> 00:55:16.816
Talk about my clothes.

1149
00:55:16.858 --> 00:55:18.860
(laughs)

1150
00:55:20.195 --> 00:55:21.321
All right?

1151
00:55:21.363 --> 00:55:23.156
- All right.

1152
00:55:23.198 --> 00:55:23.907
- Come on.

1153
00:55:32.248 --> 00:55:33.249
(sensual music starts)

1154
00:55:33.291 --> 00:55:37.170
* Sometimes I feel like

1155
00:55:37.212 --> 00:55:40.131
* I totally lost control

1156
00:55:40.173 --> 00:55:43.051
(moans loudly)

1157
00:55:43.093 --> 00:55:47.305
* There's a whole lot of
strings attached to me

1158
00:55:47.347 --> 00:55:51.309
* My eyes see. but my
mouth don't speak

1159
00:55:51.351 --> 00:55:54.479
* Can't you see what
you doing to me?

1160
00:55:54.521 --> 00:55:59.234
* Feel that strong hold
that don't wanna go

1161
00:55:59.275 --> 00:56:00.568
(moans continue)

1162
00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:05.031
* I know that this ain't real

1163
00:56:05.073 --> 00:56:06.991
- (Narrator) It's human
nature to lean on others.

1164
00:56:07.033 --> 00:56:08.410
to fill an eternal void.

1165
00:56:08.451 --> 00:56:11.079
That mistake can
cost you everything.

1166
00:56:14.457 --> 00:56:17.419
(car door slams)

1167
00:56:19.421 --> 00:56:22.257
- Oh. I'm sorry.

1168
00:56:22.298 --> 00:56:24.384
I mean I tried.

1169
00:56:24.426 --> 00:56:25.719
I'm sorry. I did.

1170
00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.344
- You did.

1171
00:56:26.386 --> 00:56:27.387
You did good.

1172
00:56:27.429 --> 00:56:28.221
You did good.

1173
00:56:28.263 --> 00:56:29.055
- I'm good?

1174
00:56:29.097 --> 00:56:30.098
- Yes.

1175
00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:30.890
- Whew.

1176
00:56:32.183 --> 00:56:35.145
(bodies struggling)

1177
00:56:36.062 --> 00:56:38.690
(gasps for air)

1178
00:56:47.323 --> 00:56:50.535
* Broken promises

1179
00:56:55.373 --> 00:56:57.459
- Mind I join you?

1180
00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.211
- As long as you don't use
any of those corny lines.

1181
00:57:01.629 --> 00:57:03.256
- You make me nervous. woman.

1182
00:57:03.298 --> 00:57:04.341
I'm trying to come
at you the right way.

1183
00:57:04.382 --> 00:57:06.384
Why you so hard on men?

1184
00:57:06.426 --> 00:57:08.887
- Because you all
think women are easy.

1185
00:57:08.928 --> 00:57:10.513
- Is that why your
date never showed up?

1186
00:57:10.555 --> 00:57:12.932
- Hold up. he's not my date.

1187
00:57:12.974 --> 00:57:14.267
He's my ex.

1188
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:16.269
And he's gonna stay that way.

1189
00:57:16.311 --> 00:57:17.979
Enough of the
questions about me.

1190
00:57:18.021 --> 00:57:20.774
What's up with you.
what's your story?

1191
00:57:20.815 --> 00:57:22.442
- How about we go someplace?

1192
00:57:22.484 --> 00:57:24.444
- Okay. cool.

1193
00:57:24.486 --> 00:57:26.988
(upbeat music)

1194
00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:42.045
- You should know I'm
calling off the wedding.

1195
00:57:42.087 --> 00:57:42.962
- What about Sean?

1196
00:57:44.047 --> 00:57:44.881
- What about him?

1197
00:57:45.924 --> 00:57:47.967
- You know dude's
crazy over you.

1198
00:57:48.009 --> 00:57:50.303
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

1199
00:57:50.345 --> 00:57:52.514
- He doesn't want
kids. but I do.

1200
00:57:54.641 --> 00:57:56.309
- I'm surprised nobody
put a little bun

1201
00:57:56.351 --> 00:57:57.477
in that oven already.

1202
00:57:57.519 --> 00:57:58.311
- Shut up.

1203
00:57:58.353 --> 00:58:00.563
(laughs)

1204
00:58:02.232 --> 00:58:03.817
- I told you not
to hire his ass.

1205
00:58:04.818 --> 00:58:06.736
He been playing
you the whole time.

1206
00:58:09.197 --> 00:58:10.281
- I hired this man.

1207
00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.411
He been fucking my
wife this whole time?

1208
00:58:14.452 --> 00:58:16.871
(tense music)

1209
00:58:21.501 --> 00:58:23.545
You knew about this. huh?

1210
00:58:28.591 --> 00:58:31.302
- Oh. you think I
knew about this?

1211
00:58:31.344 --> 00:58:32.762
He out here fucking Candace.

1212
00:58:32.804 --> 00:58:34.305
You think I knew about this?

1213
00:58:36.391 --> 00:58:37.767
Bro. let me handle this. man.

1214
00:58:38.727 --> 00:58:41.187
Let me tighten this
up for you. man.

1215
00:58:41.229 --> 00:58:41.980
Come on.

1216
00:58:43.815 --> 00:58:45.025
Bro. let me get this.

1217
00:58:48.987 --> 00:58:49.738
(birds chirping)

1218
00:58:49.779 --> 00:58:51.322
- It's really nice out here.

1219
00:58:51.364 --> 00:58:52.240
- Yeah.

1220
00:58:52.282 --> 00:58:54.701
(laughs)

1221
00:58:54.743 --> 00:58:56.411
- What's this on your necklace?

1222
00:58:56.453 --> 00:59:00.623
- It's my Grandma. she
died October 19th. 2016.

1223
00:59:00.665 --> 00:59:02.834
- Oh man. sorry to hear that.

1224
00:59:02.876 --> 00:59:04.210
- Thanks.

1225
00:59:04.252 --> 00:59:05.462
- Were y'all close?

1226
00:59:05.503 --> 00:59:06.796
- Oh yeah.

1227
00:59:06.838 --> 00:59:09.049
When she left. my
world went upside down.

1228
00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:10.425
You know?

1229
00:59:10.467 --> 00:59:11.926
I went through hard surgery.

1230
00:59:13.178 --> 00:59:15.513
and just learned how to deal
with it on a daily basis.

1231
00:59:15.555 --> 00:59:16.806
- Yeah.

1232
00:59:16.848 --> 00:59:18.558
- But back to your ex.

1233
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:19.726
(hisses)

1234
00:59:19.768 --> 00:59:21.519
A man would be crazy
to stand you up.

1235
00:59:21.561 --> 00:59:23.146
Especially how
beautiful you are.

1236
00:59:23.188 --> 00:59:27.442
- Listen. commitment changes
everything. for some people.

1237
00:59:27.484 --> 00:59:29.569
(laughs)

1238
00:59:29.611 --> 00:59:32.030
- You know. married men.
they never leave home.

1239
00:59:32.072 --> 00:59:33.198
They just stray.

1240
00:59:33.239 --> 00:59:34.949
But they always go back to her.

1241
00:59:34.991 --> 00:59:38.453
- Okay. who said anything
about him being married?

1242
00:59:38.495 --> 00:59:40.121
- I know that man that
doesn't show for a date.

1243
00:59:40.163 --> 00:59:41.664
that's the one who isn't
supposed to be on one

1244
00:59:41.706 --> 00:59:43.667
to begin with.
just being nothing.

1245
00:59:43.708 --> 00:59:45.919
- (laughs) Whatever.

1246
00:59:49.422 --> 00:59:51.007
Don't be looking
at me like that.

1247
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:54.803
Don't be trying to be
romantic and stuff. (laughs)

1248
00:59:57.305 --> 01:00:00.308
- What you see is what you
get with me. baby. (laughs)

1249
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:04.521
- So. not every woman gets
the golden treatment. huh?

1250
01:00:04.562 --> 01:00:05.689
- Nah.

1251
01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:08.149
What you see is what
you get. unlike your ex.

1252
01:00:10.235 --> 01:00:11.695
Now I don't discriminate.

1253
01:00:11.736 --> 01:00:15.073
but I'm very selective about
who I pour my heart out to.

1254
01:00:15.115 --> 01:00:16.574
- Okay.

1255
01:00:16.616 --> 01:00:17.325
I got you.

1256
01:00:18.785 --> 01:00:21.579
- Man. before I took this gig.
I didn't know what I wanted.

1257
01:00:21.621 --> 01:00:24.165
All I can think about is
find a woman of my own.

1258
01:00:24.207 --> 01:00:26.209
somebody I can come
home to every night.

1259
01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:29.379
Cook for and spoil.
mentally. physically.

1260
01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:31.506
I mean. mentally and physically.

1261
01:00:31.548 --> 01:00:32.799
- I know what you mean.

1262
01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:34.634
But hold up. cook for?

1263
01:00:34.676 --> 01:00:36.302
I didn't know you cooked.

1264
01:00:36.344 --> 01:00:37.762
- Oh yeah.

1265
01:00:37.804 --> 01:00:39.264
'cause I have to show you how
I throw down in the kitchen.

1266
01:00:39.305 --> 01:00:40.515
(laughs)

1267
01:00:40.557 --> 01:00:41.850
But just so you know.

1268
01:00:41.891 --> 01:00:44.644
I was the one that made that
food for the book event.

1269
01:00:44.686 --> 01:00:45.854
- Wait a minute.

1270
01:00:46.688 --> 01:00:49.149
I thought that fool was catered.

1271
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:53.028
Angel told me that she got a
special deal on them trays.

1272
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:54.738
- Yeah. she got a
deal. all right.

1273
01:00:54.779 --> 01:00:57.323
She threw me a little
something through. for it.

1274
01:00:57.365 --> 01:00:59.701
I guess she didn't feel like
damn bother with the task.

1275
01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:01.536
- Typical. damn Angel.

1276
01:01:01.578 --> 01:01:03.163
That girl. I don't
know about her.

1277
01:01:03.204 --> 01:01:06.207
She is something
else. like. I swear.

1278
01:01:08.293 --> 01:01:09.127
Damn Angel

1279
01:01:09.169 --> 01:01:10.670
- She can be shady to me though.

1280
01:01:10.712 --> 01:01:12.297
But that kind always is.

1281
01:01:12.339 --> 01:01:13.673
- Yeah.

1282
01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:15.133
- And the way she's
creeping with Candace's man

1283
01:01:15.175 --> 01:01:17.010
shows the level of
standards she has.

1284
01:01:17.052 --> 01:01:18.011
- Excuse me?

1285
01:01:18.053 --> 01:01:19.679
Wait. what are
you talking about?

1286
01:01:19.721 --> 01:01:21.348
Sean would never
do that to Candace.

1287
01:01:21.389 --> 01:01:22.807
- If you say so.

1288
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:24.351
A brother knows when there's
a little something. something

1289
01:01:24.392 --> 01:01:25.727
going on between two adults.

1290
01:01:25.769 --> 01:01:27.228
And the way she acts around him.

1291
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:30.315
if she isn't sleeping with him.
she sure as hell trying to.

1292
01:01:32.359 --> 01:01:35.904
But for what it's worth. I
joke and play around a lot.

1293
01:01:35.945 --> 01:01:37.113
But you really beautiful.

1294
01:01:37.155 --> 01:01:38.698
You deserve to be
treated like a queen.

1295
01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.367
not secondhand trash.

1296
01:01:40.408 --> 01:01:43.328
- (laughs) Thank you. I guess.

1297
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:44.579
- Trust me.

1298
01:01:44.621 --> 01:01:46.456
I can make you feel things
you never felt before.

1299
01:01:46.498 --> 01:01:48.041
- Ooh! (laughs)

1300
01:01:48.083 --> 01:01:48.750
Hold up now.

1301
01:01:50.919 --> 01:01:53.630
You are something else. Derek.

1302
01:01:53.672 --> 01:01:56.091
(gentle music)

1303
01:02:03.431 --> 01:02:05.308
- Why not adopt?

1304
01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:06.768
- That's what I said.

1305
01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.228
He doesn't wanna adopt.

1306
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:09.646
He wants to take
care of his own kids.

1307
01:02:09.688 --> 01:02:12.607
He doesn't want to
bother nobody else's.

1308
01:02:12.649 --> 01:02:15.652
- Man. it's messed up.

1309
01:02:15.694 --> 01:02:16.778
- So what about you?

1310
01:02:18.321 --> 01:02:19.114
- Nah.

1311
01:02:21.157 --> 01:02:23.535
all my hopes of fatherhood
went down the toilet.

1312
01:02:26.621 --> 01:02:27.664
I don't think I have
a choice anymore.

1313
01:02:27.706 --> 01:02:29.541
I can't move on like that.

1314
01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:33.003
- Is that why you don't
talk about your ex anymore?

1315
01:02:35.714 --> 01:02:37.298
- Pretty much. I mean.

1316
01:02:43.638 --> 01:02:45.807
I kind of feel like
it was my fault.

1317
01:02:46.683 --> 01:02:48.935
- I thought she
committed suicide?

1318
01:02:48.977 --> 01:02:51.771
- That's what all covered
up crimes are said to be.

1319
01:02:51.813 --> 01:02:52.981
- I don't understand.

1320
01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.776
- I knew her too well.

1321
01:02:56.818 --> 01:02:58.528
There's no way she
would've killed herself.

1322
01:03:00.113 --> 01:03:01.614
- This why you ain't been
answering your phone?

1323
01:03:01.656 --> 01:03:02.657
You out here acting like a ho?

1324
01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:03.616
- What the hell
is wrong with you!

1325
01:03:03.658 --> 01:03:04.868
- Stay away from my wife.

1326
01:03:04.909 --> 01:03:06.411
- Hey. don't make
a scene. big fella.

1327
01:03:07.495 --> 01:03:09.456
- Babe. this man's not
who you think he is.

1328
01:03:09.497 --> 01:03:10.957
- Stop acting jealous. Sean.

1329
01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:12.584
- Look all these
kids around here.

1330
01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:14.044
- Get your hands off me.

1331
01:03:14.085 --> 01:03:16.546
- You don't want them to witness
a murder. do you? (laughs)

1332
01:03:16.588 --> 01:03:17.464
- It's gonna be
all right. Candace

1333
01:03:17.505 --> 01:03:19.007
- Want that on your conscience?

1334
01:03:19.049 --> 01:03:20.592
You got one of them?

1335
01:03:20.633 --> 01:03:21.676
- Sean. go home!

1336
01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:22.802
Just go home.

1337
01:03:22.844 --> 01:03:24.137
- Hey. we ain't going nowhere.

1338
01:03:24.179 --> 01:03:25.764
He playing you.

1339
01:03:25.805 --> 01:03:26.765
- It's okay. Candace. chill out.

1340
01:03:26.806 --> 01:03:28.099
Play the tape.

1341
01:03:28.141 --> 01:03:30.643
- Oh. you wanna
hear the tape. bro?

1342
01:03:30.685 --> 01:03:31.770
Don't move. big fella.

1343
01:03:31.811 --> 01:03:33.146
Don't move. big fella.

1344
01:03:33.188 --> 01:03:33.980
Yeah.

1345
01:03:34.022 --> 01:03:36.483
- Hey. listen to that. Huh?

1346
01:03:36.524 --> 01:03:37.942
(tape plays)

1347
01:03:37.984 --> 01:03:39.986
- I asked you to help me 'cause
I wanted that bitch gone.

1348
01:03:40.028 --> 01:03:42.280
- You have 24 hours to
put 50 K in my account.

1349
01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:45.658
- Huh. sure do sound
like you. don't it?

1350
01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.786
- Yeah. told you.

1351
01:03:47.827 --> 01:03:48.995
- Is this true?

1352
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:51.539
Where is she?

1353
01:03:51.581 --> 01:03:52.332
- We don't know.

1354
01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:55.919
- Drop this off
and then disappear.

1355
01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.253
Hey. I got it though.

1356
01:03:57.295 --> 01:03:58.588
I'll find it.

1357
01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:00.715
- Him and Angel been skimming
against you all along.

1358
01:04:00.757 --> 01:04:01.549
- You're lying.

1359
01:04:06.262 --> 01:04:08.682
Don't ever come near me again.

1360
01:04:08.723 --> 01:04:11.685
(groans loudly)

1361
01:04:11.726 --> 01:04:13.395
- Be lucky you got that.

1362
01:04:13.436 --> 01:04:15.772
Next time I'm brought
you into jail myself.

1363
01:04:15.814 --> 01:04:17.607
Mike told to me save you.

1364
01:04:20.735 --> 01:04:23.029
- How the mighty fall. big boy.

1365
01:04:23.071 --> 01:04:26.700
24 hours. get the money.

1366
01:04:26.741 --> 01:04:27.492
Let's go.

1367
01:04:30.412 --> 01:04:32.205
(sensual music starts)

1368
01:04:32.247 --> 01:04:35.792
* Now I'm breaking
all the rules

1369
01:04:35.834 --> 01:04:38.461
* Got me feeling so feel

1370
01:04:38.503 --> 01:04:41.798
* Baby. because of the
crowds in the air

1371
01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.885
* I just sit back.
relax. baby still

1372
01:04:45.927 --> 01:04:49.055
* Disguises don't go

1373
01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:52.350
* And you too far
away from home

1374
01:04:52.392 --> 01:04:53.810
* Sometimes I really.
really want to go

1375
01:04:53.852 --> 01:04:56.438
(door clicks)

1376
01:04:59.733 --> 01:05:01.484
- Hey. miss Glenda.

1377
01:05:02.902 --> 01:05:04.946
- Oh. I remember. them!

1378
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:08.742
Still got them shorts.

1379
01:05:08.783 --> 01:05:10.994
(laughs)

1380
01:05:14.414 --> 01:05:15.206
- Oh God.

1381
01:05:17.751 --> 01:05:19.753
Oh. look.

1382
01:05:19.794 --> 01:05:22.422
Talking about what
happened to Angel.

1383
01:05:22.464 --> 01:05:23.840
- What the hell?

1384
01:05:23.882 --> 01:05:26.217
- I didn't like that bitch.

1385
01:05:26.259 --> 01:05:28.094
But even I know that she
loves herself too much

1386
01:05:28.136 --> 01:05:29.346
to take herself out.

1387
01:05:29.387 --> 01:05:30.055
- Right?

1388
01:05:30.096 --> 01:05:30.930
- Doesn't makes sense.

1389
01:05:30.972 --> 01:05:32.640
- Something is not adding up.

1390
01:05:32.682 --> 01:05:33.433
- It's not.

1391
01:05:36.644 --> 01:05:37.979
You sure you gonna be okay?

1392
01:05:39.314 --> 01:05:41.274
- Nobody's seen or heard
from Angel all day.

1393
01:05:41.316 --> 01:05:43.818
Her sister's been
blowing me up like crazy.

1394
01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.071
I don't know how to feel.

1395
01:05:47.405 --> 01:05:49.240
- Do you think he really
would've took your life

1396
01:05:49.282 --> 01:05:51.951
after he gave you one
worth of living for?

1397
01:05:51.993 --> 01:05:52.952
- I don't know.

1398
01:05:52.994 --> 01:05:54.454
I don't really care right now.

1399
01:05:54.496 --> 01:05:56.956
All I want think about is this
vacation that we're going on.

1400
01:05:56.998 --> 01:05:58.583
I'm gonna go check in online.

1401
01:05:58.625 --> 01:06:00.043
- All right.

1402
01:06:00.085 --> 01:06:02.462
Well I just kept my
stuff in the car.

1403
01:06:02.504 --> 01:06:03.213
- Okay.

1404
01:06:05.465 --> 01:06:08.093
(bags rustling)

1405
01:06:10.011 --> 01:06:12.681
(door clicks)

1406
01:06:15.183 --> 01:06:16.976
- What are you doing here?

1407
01:06:17.018 --> 01:06:18.520
What are you doing here?

1408
01:06:18.561 --> 01:06:19.771
What. what. ah!

1409
01:06:19.813 --> 01:06:22.524
(taser snapping)

1410
01:06:22.565 --> 01:06:26.319
(car engine revving)

1411
01:06:26.361 --> 01:06:27.946
- Sean. Sean!

1412
01:06:27.987 --> 01:06:29.197
- What you doing here. bro?

1413
01:06:29.239 --> 01:06:31.157
- Look. I know you
don't believe me.

1414
01:06:31.199 --> 01:06:32.867
but your brother
set all of this up.

1415
01:06:32.909 --> 01:06:34.077
Candace is in trouble

1416
01:06:34.119 --> 01:06:35.954
and if we don't make
it to her right now.

1417
01:06:35.995 --> 01:06:37.997
Candace's blood's
gonna be on your hands!

1418
01:06:38.039 --> 01:06:40.125
Come on brother. let's go.

1419
01:06:42.002 --> 01:06:44.713
(car door slams)

1420
01:06:46.965 --> 01:06:48.758
- Oh. shit!

1421
01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.720
(bodies struggling)

1422
01:06:52.971 --> 01:06:54.472
- Leave her alone.

1423
01:06:54.514 --> 01:06:57.851
- (laughs) Look who

that I'm the luckiest
man in the world.

Never underestimate
the will of God.
