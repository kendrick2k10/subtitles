anyone about this.

1041
01:19:16.664 --> 01:19:19.145
We can't let anyone
hurt them.

1042
01:19:20.059 --> 01:19:21.234
Please let this go.

1043
01:19:24.281 --> 01:19:25.282
Okay.

1044
01:19:26.109 --> 01:19:27.066
I'll let it go.

1045
01:19:32.724 --> 01:19:34.246
TYLER: Will we ever
see you again?

1046
01:19:35.118 --> 01:19:36.510
Of course. you will.

1047
01:19:38.121 --> 01:19:41.254
We're gonna hold this memory
in our hearts forever.

1048
01:19:41.298 --> 01:19:43.343
It's gonna keep us bonded
for the rest of our lives.

SARAH:
Okay. dude. let her go.

1050

HANNAH: Bye. Travis.

1051
01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.575
Bye.

1052
01:19:59.011 --> 01:20:00.186
All right.
let's get out of here.

1053
01:20:02.885 --> 01:20:03.886
HANNAH: Bye.

1054
01:20:16.246 --> 01:20:19.031
ADULT TRAVIS:
So that's my story
about Mysti. the mermaid.

1055
01:20:19.075 --> 01:20:21.338
a lost sea creature

1056
01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:23.166
that helped us form a family.

1057
01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:27.213
Five misfits make
one big happy family.

1058
01:20:27.257 --> 01:20:28.648
and friends for life.

1060
01:21:31.625 --> 01:21:34.541
I stayed in Adventure Harbor
and helped my mom more.

1061
01:21:35.281 --> 01:21:36.326
It was weird.

1062
01:21:36.369 --> 01:21:37.501
The more helpful I was.

1063
01:21:37.544 --> 01:21:39.111
the happier she was.

1064
01:21:39.155 --> 01:21:41.679
and we got closer
and closer.

1065
01:21:41.722 --> 01:21:43.942
I shared with others
all the magic

1066
01:21:43.986 --> 01:21:45.509
that the harbor
had to offer.

1067
01:21:47.119 --> 01:21:49.425
Nate and Tyler moved on
after high school.

1068
01:21:49.469 --> 01:21:51.732
and became
comic book sensations.

1069
01:21:53.082 --> 01:21:55.780
Sarah became a model
and a fashion designer.

1070
01:21:55.823 --> 01:21:57.434
All her dreams came true.

1071
01:21:58.696 --> 01:22:00.567
Hannah and I got married.

1072
01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:02.439
Just kidding.

1073
01:22:02.482 --> 01:22:03.657
She followed her dream.

1074
01:22:03.701 --> 01:22:05.398
and became a very
successful reporter.

1075
01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:11.491
Friends are the family
you choose.
