3
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.110
Tobias!

4
00:01:52.373 --> 00:01:53.765
Tobias!

5
00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:04.167
That'’s okay.

6
00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:07.605
There we go.

7
00:02:14.873 --> 00:02:15.874
You'’re okay. right?

8
00:02:16.048 --> 00:02:18.529
Tobias!

9
00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:20.183
Tobias!

10
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.974
Tobias.

11
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.548
Here. hold it down!

12
00:02:37.722 --> 00:02:38.680
Yes. sir!

13
00:02:39.463 --> 00:02:41.117
Where'’s your sister?

14
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:43.032
She'’s fetching what she can
from the well.

15
00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:46.035
We can distill
our drinking water
from the snow.

16
00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.689
Hitch up Fable
and go fetch her.

17
00:02:47.863 --> 00:02:48.907
Time is wasting.

18
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:50.126
Yes. sir.

19
00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:09.319
We have to go.

20
00:03:09.493 --> 00:03:11.452
It'’s too early
for a storm like this.

21
00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:13.802
We'’ve held as long
as we can.

22
00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:16.283
We have
to get off this mountain
or we'’ll starve.

23
00:03:16.457 --> 00:03:19.024
Freeze or starve?
It seems the Lord
has forsaken us.

24
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.330
He is testing us.

25
00:03:20.504 --> 00:03:21.766
And the children?

26
00:03:23.246 --> 00:03:25.770
The Lord
be a capricious fiend
if he tries the helpless.

27
00:03:25.944 --> 00:03:27.119
Hush. Mother!

28
00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:35.476
We can brave the storm.

29
00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:39.044
We'’ll be safe
in the valley.

30
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.091
We should never
have come here.

31
00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:49.272
Abigale!

32
00:03:55.322 --> 00:03:56.453
Abigale!

33
00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.413
Abigale!

34
00:03:59.587 --> 00:04:01.284
You know better
than to venture
beyond the path at night.

35
00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:02.546
I just wanted to--

36
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.244
What is snow made of?

37
00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:05.984
Water.

38
00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:08.073
You are not to wander
out of my sight

39
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.597
without your Pa
or Tobias.

40
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:11.512
Is that understood?Yes. ma'’am.

41
00:04:12.817 --> 00:04:14.428
Finish stowing the wagon

42
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:17.735
so we can leave
this horrid place.

43
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.957
Have faith in your father.

44
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:24.742
He will get us
off the mountain.

45
00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:26.048
Have faith.

46
00:04:26.744 --> 00:04:28.442
Have faith.

47
00:04:28.616 --> 00:04:33.142
We must have faith
that our suffering
has a reason

48
00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:37.494
and that by the grace of God
we will be delivered.

49
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:42.978
"Blessed is the one
who endureth these trials.

50
00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.981
For having stood the test.

51
00:04:46.155 --> 00:04:48.375
he will receive
the crown of life.

52
00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:50.594
which the Lord
hath promised those

53
00:04:50.768 --> 00:04:52.292
who persevere in love.

54
00:04:53.684 --> 00:04:56.861
And you shall pass
through the river.

55
00:04:57.035 --> 00:04:59.255
but the water
will not wash over you.

56
00:04:59.429 --> 00:05:03.607
And you shall walk
through the fire.
but you shall not be burned.

57
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:06.741
No. the flames
will not set you ablaze.

58
00:05:06.915 --> 00:05:10.484
for always as you walk.
I am with you."

59
00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:14.488
"Consider it pure joy.
brothers and sisters.

60
00:05:14.662 --> 00:05:17.012
when you face
diverse trials.

61
00:05:17.186 --> 00:05:22.626
for these trials
worketh patience
and compassion.

62
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.023
Let patience and compassion
have her perfect work.

63
00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:31.853
that ye may be perfect
and entire.

64
00:05:32.027 --> 00:05:33.420
lacking nothing."

65
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.955
We got out
from underneath the storm.

66
00:06:32.261 --> 00:06:34.176
Why have we stopped?

67
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.830
He'’s no spring colt.

68
00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:38.267
He'’ll drop from exhaustion.
we push him too hard.

69
00:06:39.616 --> 00:06:41.444
This is a good place
to camp.

70
00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:47.058
Tobias.

71
00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:50.105
You scout ahead.

72
00:06:51.367 --> 00:06:54.370
Make sure there'’s not
a better spot to set up camp.

73
00:06:56.503 --> 00:06:57.895
If you don'’t object.

74
00:06:59.157 --> 00:07:00.202
I don'’t.

75
00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:08.558
Abigale.

76
00:07:09.777 --> 00:07:12.606
Stay here.
gather snow for water.

77
00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:35.846
You mind your work. girl.

78
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.979
There'’s no need
to court misfortune.

79
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.857
Well...

80
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:48.642
How many we got left?

81
00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:50.600
Only need one.

82
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.779
Right.

83
00:07:56.563 --> 00:07:57.781
Can I load it?

84
00:08:36.777 --> 00:08:37.778
There you go.

85
00:08:40.694 --> 00:08:41.695
Yeah.

86
00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:45.525
Ah. tamp it.
Slowly.

87
00:08:48.136 --> 00:08:50.225
We can'’t risk it
jamming up on us.

88
00:08:51.226 --> 00:08:52.227
Easy.

89
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:55.622
Good.

90
00:09:18.035 --> 00:09:19.254
Good.

91
00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:23.650
Can I go?

92
00:09:24.868 --> 00:09:26.435
Your place is here.
sweetheart.

93
00:09:27.262 --> 00:09:28.568
We won'’t be long.

94
00:09:50.894 --> 00:09:52.679
Goddamn it!

95
00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:55.072
What are you standing
around for?

96
00:09:55.246 --> 00:09:57.292
Go after him
while I reload.Yes. sir.

97
00:10:28.889 --> 00:10:30.499
You might'’ve got her!

98
00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:27.572
Quiet. boy.

99
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.400
They could still be here.

100
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.480
Shh.

101
00:13:05.654 --> 00:13:07.003
We'’re not gonna hurt you!
We'’re not gonna hurt you.

102
00:13:07.177 --> 00:13:08.744
Shh. Miss. Miss.

103
00:13:08.918 --> 00:13:09.832
Shh.

104
00:13:10.006 --> 00:13:11.355
Miss. we'’re on your side.

105
00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:14.576
Miss. it'’s not safe.
You have to be quiet.

106
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:15.838
Quiet.

107
00:13:16.012 --> 00:13:18.101
Shh.

108
00:13:18.275 --> 00:13:20.538
Shh.

109
00:13:28.982 --> 00:13:30.679
Tobi-- Tobias.

110
00:13:30.853 --> 00:13:31.854
Yeah.

111
00:13:33.638 --> 00:13:35.031
Snap off the arrow. huh?

112
00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:37.251
What? No. no.

113
00:13:37.425 --> 00:13:39.035
No! No! No!

114
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.562
Shh.

115
00:13:53.876 --> 00:13:56.705
I saw some moss.
A few of the trees
when we came in.

116
00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:58.054
Go.
Collect as much
as you can.

117
00:13:58.228 --> 00:13:59.360
Go. go.Yes. sir. Yes. sir.

118
00:13:59.534 --> 00:14:01.884
And get two thin branches.
Go.

119
00:14:02.058 --> 00:14:03.059
Got you.

120
00:14:03.233 --> 00:14:05.105
Okay. All right.
Shh.

121
00:14:06.323 --> 00:14:08.673
Hey. hey. hey.
None of that.
none of that.

122
00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:09.936
Stay awake.

123
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.720
What'’s your name?

124
00:14:11.894 --> 00:14:13.113
What'’s your name?

125
00:14:13.722 --> 00:14:14.679
Cassidy.

126
00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.290
I'’m Abraham.

127
00:14:16.464 --> 00:14:17.813
Do you know what happened?

128
00:14:21.556 --> 00:14:22.992
You have family elsewhere?

129
00:14:35.091 --> 00:14:37.050
You'’re welcome
to join my family.

130
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:40.444
We'’re gonna take--

131
00:14:42.533 --> 00:14:45.362
We'’ll take--
We'’ll take you somewhere safe.

132
00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:51.499
Here.Strip the bark
from the wood.

133
00:14:51.673 --> 00:14:53.283
Yes. sir.

134
00:14:53.457 --> 00:14:55.546
What-- What--
What are you doing?

135
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.636
What are you doing?I have nothing
to stitch your hand with.

136
00:14:59.463 --> 00:15:00.464
All right.

137
00:15:01.465 --> 00:15:02.510
All right.

138
00:15:04.599 --> 00:15:05.861
Hold steady.
Breathe.

139
00:15:06.035 --> 00:15:07.254
Breathe deep.
breathe deep.

140
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:09.691
Breathe deep.

141
00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:11.127
Tobias.

142
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:12.346
It'’s ready.

143
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.478
Moss. Okay.

144
00:15:14.652 --> 00:15:17.525
Take two sticks
and place '’em
on both sides of her arm.

145
00:15:17.699 --> 00:15:19.048
Yes. sir.

146
00:15:20.615 --> 00:15:23.313
Okay.
Put '’em in her coat.
Put '’em in her coat.

147
00:15:23.487 --> 00:15:25.576
Hold them there.
Yeah. hold them.

148
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.449
Hold them.
but keep '’em tight.Yes. sir.

149
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:30.930
Oh!

150
00:15:34.107 --> 00:15:35.760
Okay.

151
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.502
All right.
Brace yourself. Cassidy.
This is gonna hurt.

152
00:15:50.514 --> 00:15:52.168
Where did you learn
to do that?

153
00:15:54.692 --> 00:15:56.956
I was a medic
during the war.

154
00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:01.612
We had to make do
with whatever we had.

155
00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:12.667
Let'’s finish the job.

156
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:15.975
Okay.

157
00:17:00.149 --> 00:17:01.498
Fetch a needle
and thread. Mother.

158
00:17:01.672 --> 00:17:03.370
Mama!
Quickly!

159
00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:05.633
Oh. God.
What on earth?

160
00:17:07.243 --> 00:17:09.028
Here.
Clear out that chair.

161
00:17:09.202 --> 00:17:10.681
What happened
to her?

162
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.816
She. uh...
She was--

163
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:16.383
Her party. uh...

164
00:17:17.906 --> 00:17:21.388
Tobias found her camp.
She'’s lucky to be alive.

165
00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:25.479
Mother.
where'’s the thread?

166
00:17:25.653 --> 00:17:27.046
I...Mother.

167
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.526
I got it.We couldn'’t abandon her.

168
00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:32.138
No. of course not.

169
00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:35.271
I don'’t think
they'’re infected.
Not yet. at least.

170
00:17:35.967 --> 00:17:37.665
We'’ll know come dawn.

171
00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:39.406
Tobias. finish the hunt.

172
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.581
Yes. sir.

173
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.801
You did well today.

174
00:18:15.703 --> 00:18:18.053
You ready?
I got you. I got you.

175
00:18:21.796 --> 00:18:24.973
Yep. I got you.

176
00:18:25.147 --> 00:18:26.801
It'’s all right.
Miss.

177
00:18:26.975 --> 00:18:28.759
You'’re safe.
Pa will take good
care of you. I promise.

178
00:18:28.933 --> 00:18:30.892
There. there.
There. there now.

179
00:18:31.066 --> 00:18:32.720
There.
There now.

180
00:18:34.896 --> 00:18:37.420
All right.

181
00:18:37.594 --> 00:18:38.769
I got you. I got you.

182
00:18:38.943 --> 00:18:41.076
There. There now.

183
00:18:46.342 --> 00:18:48.431
Hold it still.I got you-- I got her.

184
00:18:48.605 --> 00:18:49.998
Hold it still.I got you.
I got you.

185
00:18:51.478 --> 00:18:52.479
All right.

186
00:18:55.482 --> 00:18:56.874
All right.
all right.

187
00:18:57.048 --> 00:18:58.572
That'’s it.
That'’s it. honey.

188
00:18:58.746 --> 00:19:01.183
That'’s it. honey.
Are you okay?

189
00:19:01.357 --> 00:19:03.403
Are you okay? Yeah?

190
00:19:03.577 --> 00:19:04.578
Yeah.

191
00:19:06.275 --> 00:19:09.713
All right.

192
00:19:09.887 --> 00:19:11.062
Okay.

193
00:19:11.237 --> 00:19:13.195
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

194
00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:14.588
Stay with me. dear.

195
00:19:14.762 --> 00:19:16.024
It'’s almost done.

196
00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:18.113
Stay with me. Stay with me.

197
00:19:18.287 --> 00:19:20.071
There now.
There now.

198
00:19:20.246 --> 00:19:21.856
Abigale.
help her in the wagon.

199
00:19:44.139 --> 00:19:45.619
You'’re safe with us.

200
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.100
None of us are.

201
00:20:10.296 --> 00:20:13.995
We need to be gone
before daybreak.

202
00:20:15.866 --> 00:20:18.608
Whoever attacked her
might still be close by.

203
00:20:18.782 --> 00:20:20.784
You could'’ve led them
right to us.

204
00:20:23.047 --> 00:20:25.354
No one was around
as far as I could see.

205
00:20:28.705 --> 00:20:30.446
We couldn'’t just
leave her there.

206
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:33.710
There'’s barely enough food
to feed ourselves.

207
00:20:33.884 --> 00:20:35.277
let alone a stray.

208
00:20:57.343 --> 00:20:59.083
This was all you could find?

209
00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:01.347
It'’s something. Abraham.

210
00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:07.483
We must'’ve lost the ammunition
at the other camp.

211
00:21:15.709 --> 00:21:16.971
And you caught these how?

212
00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:20.714
I made a snare.
Like you taught me.

213
00:21:26.372 --> 00:21:27.634
I'’ll brine it overnight.

214
00:21:27.808 --> 00:21:31.377
Do you need help?No. it won'’t take long.

215
00:21:32.552 --> 00:21:33.553
You rest.

216
00:21:34.423 --> 00:21:35.729
You'’ve done too much today.

217
00:24:28.336 --> 00:24:31.774
I'’ll take the man.
You take the woman.

218
00:25:57.556 --> 00:25:59.514
Hey. Hey.

219
00:25:59.688 --> 00:26:01.516
Don'’t you touch her.
Don'’t you touch her.

220
00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:02.691
Don'’t touch her.

221
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.180

You don'’t think
I have a good singing voice?

229
00:27:02.185 --> 00:27:04.144
I'’ve been told
I have the voice
of an angel.

230
00:27:04.318 --> 00:27:06.973
Ooh!What motherfucker
told you that?

231
00:27:07.147 --> 00:27:09.715
Well. funny enough.
it was your mother.

232
00:27:09.889 --> 00:27:11.847
She told me
while I was fucking her.

233
00:27:15.677 --> 00:27:17.374
You think
that shit'’s funny.
Felix?

234
00:27:18.201 --> 00:27:19.681
No. No. I don'’t think that.

235
00:27:19.855 --> 00:27:21.596
You think it'’s funny. boy?No. No. I don'’t.

236
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.206
He thinks
it'’s very funny.

237
00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.295
Ah. hell with all y'’all.

238
00:27:25.469 --> 00:27:27.950
Oh. Rhys.
there'’s no reason
for you to be upset.

239
00:27:28.124 --> 00:27:30.605
If anything. I'’m the one
who should be upset.

240
00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:33.173
Yeah?
Why is that. Logan?

241
00:27:33.347 --> 00:27:36.263
Because I thought
I was the only one
fucking your mother.

242
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.962
Whoo!

243
00:27:41.834 --> 00:27:43.574

We'’ve crossed a line.

Apologies. Rhys.

245
00:27:45.402 --> 00:27:47.404
And since you are new here.

246
00:27:47.578 --> 00:27:50.190

What say you?
Left bank or right?

255
00:29:57.839 --> 00:30:03.845
In this hand.
1864 Château Lafite.

256
00:30:04.019 --> 00:30:07.457
Dominant grape.
Cabernet Sauvignon.

257
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:10.199
Sturdy vintage.
to be sure.

258
00:30:10.373 --> 00:30:15.465
Characterized by notes
of smoke. incense tar
and saddle leather.

259
00:30:15.639 --> 00:30:19.643
Thomas Jefferson himself
never drank its like.

260
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:21.297
Brody?Dang!

261
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:24.039
Well said.

262
00:30:24.213 --> 00:30:28.522
And in this hand.
a more recent Saint-EÉmilion.

263
00:30:28.696 --> 00:30:30.089
a Merlot.

264
00:30:30.263 --> 00:30:34.006
Redolent of blackberry. spice.
vanilla and jam.

265
00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:40.229
Both bottles liberated
from their oppressors!

266
00:30:40.403 --> 00:30:43.145
Whoo!En route across
our territory!

267
00:30:43.319 --> 00:30:45.931
Whoo!To the San Francisco
boomtown.

268
00:30:46.105 --> 00:30:47.106
Felix?

269
00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.542
It'’s real good.
Thank you.

270
00:30:50.022 --> 00:30:54.287
Here. my friend.
Take both.

271
00:30:55.244 --> 00:30:56.985
They'’re each worth
about $40.

272
00:30:57.159 --> 00:30:58.987
Whoo.

273
00:31:00.336 --> 00:31:01.729
Enjoy.

274
00:31:06.952 --> 00:31:08.867
Don'’t know
why we'’re celebratin'’.

275
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:10.477
Anything good?

276
00:31:10.651 --> 00:31:13.262
Shit and more shit. Hey!
Get your hand out of there.

277
00:31:14.698 --> 00:31:16.787
We could probably get something
for the horse.

278
00:31:16.962 --> 00:31:20.574
She'’s worth more as glue.Yeah.

279
00:31:20.748 --> 00:31:23.882
There'’s only one thing
in this camp worth a shit.

280
00:31:24.056 --> 00:31:27.320
and that shit
belongs to Logan.

281
00:32:20.025 --> 00:32:22.418
God. it'’s good
to have you back.

282
00:32:23.419 --> 00:32:24.855
It'’s good to be warm.

283
00:32:29.686 --> 00:32:31.210
They was decent folk.

284
00:32:32.298 --> 00:32:34.474
Most would'’ve just put me
out of my misery.

285
00:32:36.737 --> 00:32:38.260
Is that what you want?

286
00:32:40.262 --> 00:32:41.916
You know it'’s not.

287
00:32:43.613 --> 00:32:46.529
After last time. who knows
what I know about you.

288
00:32:53.493 --> 00:32:54.581
But they...

289
00:32:59.281 --> 00:33:01.849
Let me fix that for you.

290
00:33:11.946 --> 00:33:15.558
If you hadn'’t tried to run.
we wouldn'’t have
had to do that to you.

291
00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:20.433
If you try and run again...

292
00:33:24.567 --> 00:33:26.004
it'’ll be much worse.
savvy?

293
00:33:37.754 --> 00:33:38.799
Yes.

294
00:33:40.235 --> 00:33:41.932
Oh!

295
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.070
Oh!

296
00:34:00.081 --> 00:34:02.649
You didn'’t bring me
all the way here
just to shoot me.

297
00:34:02.823 --> 00:34:04.346
I wouldn'’t waste a bullet
on you.

298
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.565
Mmm.

299
00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:09.525
Hey.

300
00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:12.833
Leave her out of this.

301
00:34:13.007 --> 00:34:15.749
You were about her age
when you started.

302
00:34:17.446 --> 00:34:22.538
The way I see it.
you can show her the way
we do things around here.

303
00:34:24.888 --> 00:34:26.890
Or I can put you both
out of my misery.

304
00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:28.718
Hmm?

305
00:34:28.892 --> 00:34:30.981
Okay!
Okay. Okay.

306
00:34:31.156 --> 00:34:32.592
Hey.

307
00:34:36.552 --> 00:34:38.250
Just don'’t hurt her.

308
00:34:41.209 --> 00:34:43.081
Holster my guns.

309
00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:52.916
Don'’t drop '’em.

310
00:35:46.274 --> 00:35:47.797
Mmm.

311
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.535
If Logan catches you.
he'’ll kill us both.

312
00:36:31.232 --> 00:36:33.147
You brought me here.
Help me.

313
00:36:33.321 --> 00:36:35.280
Them boys out there
aren'’t so bad.

314
00:36:35.454 --> 00:36:37.282
Just do what they want.
you'’ll be okay.

315
00:36:37.456 --> 00:36:40.023
And what do they want?
To whore me out?

316
00:36:40.937 --> 00:36:42.983
No. nothing like that.

317
00:36:44.506 --> 00:36:45.986
Then what?

318
00:36:47.814 --> 00:36:50.251
Get folks to stop
on the road.
take me in.

319
00:36:54.473 --> 00:36:55.561
It was you.

320
00:36:56.736 --> 00:36:58.390
You don'’t know what
you'’re talking about--

321
00:36:58.564 --> 00:37:00.783
My family'’s dead
because of you!I never killed no one.

322
00:37:00.957 --> 00:37:02.568
Fuck you!I saved your life.

323
00:37:02.742 --> 00:37:05.005
I wish you'’d
just killed me instead!

324
00:37:06.354 --> 00:37:07.312
You don'’t mean that.

325
00:37:09.183 --> 00:37:10.489
Leave me alone.

326
00:37:11.446 --> 00:37:13.231
Leave me alone! Go!

327
00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:48.309
Where'’d you get that?

328
00:37:48.483 --> 00:37:50.093
Ah. found it.

329
00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:51.399
Stole it.
more like.

330
00:37:53.096 --> 00:37:56.012
We'’re thieves.
Practicing.

331
00:38:04.456 --> 00:38:07.110
How come
you'’re not wearing gloves?

332
00:38:07.285 --> 00:38:09.112
Don'’t that hurt?No.

333
00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:11.201
Well. why in the hell not?

334
00:38:14.857 --> 00:38:17.904
All right. all right.
Okay.

335
00:38:19.209 --> 00:38:20.646
What you doing. man?

336
00:38:21.734 --> 00:38:23.039
What the fuck you doing. man?

337
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.041
Watch this.

338
00:38:26.347 --> 00:38:27.479
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

339
00:38:28.654 --> 00:38:29.698
Cut it out!

340
00:38:31.744 --> 00:38:32.788
Stop it!

341
00:38:32.962 --> 00:38:34.137
Quit it. man.

342
00:38:35.182 --> 00:38:37.315
Stop!
You'’re fucking crazy. man!

343
00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.060
I don'’t feel nothin'’.

344
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.325
I'’ve been that way
my whole life.

345
00:38:48.413 --> 00:38:51.024
Doctors got no explanation
for it.

346
00:38:52.199 --> 00:38:53.505
I don'’t feel nothin'’.

347
00:39:01.556 --> 00:39:05.604
This trade here.
I learned in the workhouse.

348
00:39:05.778 --> 00:39:09.695
I work.
You'’re just takin'’ up space.

349
00:39:09.869 --> 00:39:11.218
I got my uses.

350
00:39:11.392 --> 00:39:13.351
Yeah. tippin'’ that bottle
ain'’t useful.

351
00:39:13.525 --> 00:39:15.788
Fuck you.I'’m good.

352
00:39:15.962 --> 00:39:19.400
I'’m just waitin'’ on Logan.
then.

353
00:39:19.574 --> 00:39:22.795
Why don'’t you
make yourself useful.
let him know.

354
00:39:23.796 --> 00:39:24.884
Not you.

355
00:39:27.887 --> 00:39:29.410
Hey. I'’m talking to you. Brody.

356
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.371
Now.

357
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.076
Put your fuckin'’ britches on.

358
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:44.730
I'’m comin'’ in.

359
00:39:45.644 --> 00:39:47.297
Y'’all decent?

360
00:39:47.863 --> 00:39:49.517
Aw. fuck.

361
00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:52.041
Y'’all is decent.

362
00:39:52.215 --> 00:39:56.045
I was hoping
you'’d be in mid-orgy
or some shit.

363
00:39:56.219 --> 00:39:59.005
What-- What is that
you call it? Uh...

364
00:39:59.179 --> 00:40:02.312
A ménage à trois?
"Menagerie de todd!"

365
00:40:02.487 --> 00:40:04.619
Someday. maybe.

366
00:40:04.793 --> 00:40:06.621
Yes. bonne chance.

367
00:40:06.795 --> 00:40:08.710
And please knock
before entering
from now on.

368
00:40:08.884 --> 00:40:10.146
Were you raised
in a barn?

369
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.583
Yes. sir. I was.

370
00:40:14.368 --> 00:40:15.848
The horses are ready.

371
00:40:17.719 --> 00:40:19.068
Whenever you are.

372
00:40:19.242 --> 00:40:20.983
In a moment.

373
00:40:21.157 --> 00:40:25.510
All right.
There'’s a storm comin'’ up
over the ridge.

374
00:40:26.815 --> 00:40:29.383
I'’m gonna get my chaps on.
get ready.

375
00:40:29.557 --> 00:40:31.777
Get the girl ready.
She'’ll be joining us.

376
00:40:37.478 --> 00:40:38.479
She ain'’t ready.

377
00:40:38.653 --> 00:40:41.351
Well. she'’ll learn.
You did.

378
00:40:41.526 --> 00:40:43.528
Put her on the trail.
she'’s gonna run.

379
00:40:43.702 --> 00:40:46.095
She can'’t outrun
a bullet.

380
00:41:01.197 --> 00:41:03.373
Let go of me!

381
00:41:03.548 --> 00:41:05.637
Put me down!You motherfucker!

382
00:41:08.596 --> 00:41:09.902
Let me go!

383
00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.820
Stop it!

384
00:41:17.953 --> 00:41:19.259
Let me go!

385
00:41:25.265 --> 00:41:27.702
Untie me and let me go!You bitch!

386
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:35.493
You see this?
You gotta contain yourself.
woman.

387
00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:39.235
I'’m gonna cut your ropes--

388
00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:45.981
I think we'’ll just keep
the ropes on then. shall we?

389
00:41:46.155 --> 00:41:48.114
We'’ve got business
to attend to.

390
00:41:48.288 --> 00:41:49.768
Okay?

391
00:42:20.799 --> 00:42:22.322
It'’s a day away.
at least.

392
00:42:22.496 --> 00:42:24.367
I don'’t like
the look of it.

393
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:27.240
We need to keep the storm
at our backs.

394
00:42:27.414 --> 00:42:28.720
What you thinkin'’?

395
00:42:30.809 --> 00:42:33.246
You bring
the German?Of course.

396
00:42:46.607 --> 00:42:49.697
It'’s a crossroads
next to a split pine.

397
00:42:49.871 --> 00:42:50.872
See it?

398
00:42:52.265 --> 00:42:54.397
Uh-huh.We can plant
the girls there

399
00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:56.399
and wait it out
further down.

400
00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:58.271
Should we do
a walk-around first?

401
00:42:58.445 --> 00:43:00.708
Nah.
it'’ll take too long.Get ready.

402
00:43:00.882 --> 00:43:03.145
The horses aren'’t going to
like crossing this ice.

403
00:43:11.023 --> 00:43:13.199
Where do you think
you'’re going. huh?

404
00:43:14.417 --> 00:43:16.419
Ah! Oh. God.

405
00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:18.900
Oh. for fuck'’s sake.Where do you think
you'’re running?

406
00:43:19.074 --> 00:43:21.990
Can no one bring
this puckish bitch to heel?

407
00:43:32.914 --> 00:43:37.310
Damn it! I'’ve had enough
of your girlish fuckery
for one day!

408
00:43:37.484 --> 00:43:40.574
Now stand down.
or I don'’t know
what I'’m liable to do!

409
00:43:46.841 --> 00:43:47.799
Oh.

410
00:44:01.029 --> 00:44:01.943
Hey. grab up the rope!

411
00:44:02.117 --> 00:44:03.031
No!

412
00:44:08.297 --> 00:44:09.864
Grab the rope!

413
00:44:10.691 --> 00:44:12.562
Get the rope!
Grab it!

414
00:44:13.346 --> 00:44:14.956
Where is she?

415
00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:16.697
This is a river.

416
00:44:16.871 --> 00:44:18.699
Current'’s taking her
anywhere downstream.

417
00:44:18.873 --> 00:44:20.483
I think downstream
is that way.

418
00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:23.182
I don'’t care
if you bring her back
as a corpse.

419
00:44:23.356 --> 00:44:26.359
That little bitch
better be strapped
to the ass of your horse

420
00:44:26.533 --> 00:44:27.926
by the time the storm
blows over.

421
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.362
or the last camp
I left you at

422
00:44:29.536 --> 00:44:31.756
will seem like a matinee
at the panto!

423
00:44:33.279 --> 00:44:34.933
Huh?

424
00:44:47.249 --> 00:44:48.816
My daddy got this
in the army.

425
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.992
I got it when he died.

426
00:44:51.166 --> 00:44:52.385
Felix. no. I--

427
00:44:52.559 --> 00:44:54.735
You can give it back
when you'’re done.

428
00:44:56.389 --> 00:44:58.043
You'’ll be all right.

429
00:44:58.217 --> 00:45:01.481
Come on. Romeo.
Get on your horse.

430
00:45:01.655 --> 00:45:02.961
You read Shakespeare?

431
00:45:05.572 --> 00:45:07.356
What the fuck
is Shakespeare?

432
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.575
Let'’s go.

433
00:45:48.441 --> 00:45:49.834
Oh. yeah.

434
00:45:55.927 --> 00:45:56.928
There we go.

435
00:45:58.843 --> 00:46:00.888
Juniper Christmas!

436
00:46:01.062 --> 00:46:04.152
Don'’t move! Don'’t move!
Your sleeve will freeze
to the ice.

437
00:46:23.215 --> 00:46:27.175
Got a fire right yonder.
We can get you warmed up.

438
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:29.351
We need to go now.

439
00:46:29.525 --> 00:46:32.137
Soon as we get you
warm enough.Now. please!

440
00:46:32.964 --> 00:46:34.052
Who you running from?

441
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:37.969
Devils.

442
00:46:38.752 --> 00:46:40.406
Come on now.

443
00:47:15.136 --> 00:47:16.311
What happened?

444
00:47:16.485 --> 00:47:18.313
Fell through some thin ice.
I reckon.

445
00:47:18.487 --> 00:47:21.186
Just stable Orion.
I'’ll draw a bath
for this one.

446
00:47:25.755 --> 00:47:28.758
Get you warmed up
in no time.

447
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:33.024
What'’s your name?

448
00:47:33.981 --> 00:47:35.330
Abigale.

449
00:47:37.115 --> 00:47:38.203
Nora.

450
00:47:38.377 --> 00:47:40.509
My husband is Erik.

451
00:47:41.815 --> 00:47:44.862
Do you have any family
we could...

452
00:47:46.689 --> 00:47:48.169
They'’re all dead.

453
00:47:50.302 --> 00:47:51.912
Oh.

454
00:47:52.086 --> 00:47:54.654
You could stay with us
as long as you need.

455
00:48:32.344 --> 00:48:35.086
She was terrified.
That'’s for sure.

456
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:36.826
Well. where she come from?

457
00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:38.524
Can'’t have been far.

458
00:48:38.698 --> 00:48:41.527
But I didn'’t see no smoke.
so it'’s hard to say.

459
00:48:42.615 --> 00:48:44.051
She say how they died?

460
00:48:44.225 --> 00:48:45.357
No.

461
00:48:45.531 --> 00:48:47.620
What do we do with her?

462
00:48:47.794 --> 00:48:49.448
Take her in.

463
00:48:49.622 --> 00:48:51.667
The Lord sent you
to be her savior.

464
00:48:52.842 --> 00:48:54.888
What if the devil sent her
to be our demise?

465
00:48:55.062 --> 00:48:56.629
Don'’t be an old fool.

466
00:48:56.803 --> 00:48:59.153
You didn'’t see the look
in her eyes. Nora.

467
00:49:00.546 --> 00:49:03.549
What about that blood
you washed from her hair?

468
00:49:03.723 --> 00:49:05.333
The current washed
most of it away.

469
00:49:05.507 --> 00:49:06.856
You find a wound?

470
00:49:08.336 --> 00:49:13.428
Just a few lumps
and bruises.

471
00:49:29.314 --> 00:49:34.014
She can stay with us
for a time. but I'’d feel
better about the situation

472
00:49:34.188 --> 00:49:36.190
if we found someone
who knows her family.

473
00:49:37.017 --> 00:49:38.801
You'’re right.Yeah. well.

474
00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:40.673
I don'’t wanna be.

475
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:52.119
Would you like
to stay in longer?

476
00:49:52.293 --> 00:49:55.731
I could boil
some more water.

477
00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:59.344
I don'’t want
to be a burden.

478
00:49:59.518 --> 00:50:03.391
I wouldn'’t have offered
if it was any inconvenience.

479
00:50:07.787 --> 00:50:08.831
You'’re with child?

480
00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:10.616
Maybe a little.

481
00:50:11.486 --> 00:50:14.185
I don'’t--Well. Erik and I

482
00:50:14.359 --> 00:50:19.146
are happy to have you here
safe with us.

483
00:51:42.055 --> 00:51:44.144
Mmm.

484
00:51:48.627 --> 00:51:52.196
She been gone too long.
She ain'’t coming back.

485
00:51:53.458 --> 00:51:54.763
You don'’t know that.

486
00:51:57.288 --> 00:52:01.988
That was pretty of you
to sacrifice your gun.

487
00:52:03.032 --> 00:52:04.425
Least now.
it might get some use.

488
00:52:04.599 --> 00:52:06.210
Oh. it'’s been fired plenty.

489
00:52:06.384 --> 00:52:08.386
By who? Your daddy?

490
00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.823
To hell with you.
You even have a daddy?

491
00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.825
No.

492
00:52:15.523 --> 00:52:17.873
You might as well
have thrown it in the river.

493
00:52:19.223 --> 00:52:20.702
You ain'’t ever
gonna see it again.

494
00:52:21.747 --> 00:52:23.488
Mmm.

495
00:52:23.662 --> 00:52:25.794
Logan should'’ve slit her throat
last time she tried to run.

496
00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.799
Or did you forget
that part already?

497
00:52:42.985 --> 00:52:46.119
Even a shitty gun like yours
deserves to ride with someone
who'’d use it.

498
00:53:05.312 --> 00:53:06.313
Mmm.

499
00:53:07.401 --> 00:53:09.142
Them sure is good.

500
00:53:15.322 --> 00:53:16.323
Pardon.

501
00:53:20.545 --> 00:53:21.546
Good boy.

502
00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:13.195
You remember me.
right?

503
00:56:48.317 --> 00:56:50.450
Son of a bumble bee.

504
00:56:50.624 --> 00:56:51.843
Nora!

505
00:56:56.935 --> 00:56:58.893
I done told you. Nora!

506
00:57:09.513 --> 00:57:11.384
...brought that girl home.Is she gone?

507
00:57:11.558 --> 00:57:13.560
Didn'’t I say there was
something off about that girl?

508
00:57:13.734 --> 00:57:16.476
But she can'’t have gone far.
not in her condition.She'’s taken Orion.

509
00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:17.956
You are not
going after her.

510
00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:20.611
We need that horse.
Nora.No. I need you.

511
00:57:20.785 --> 00:57:24.789
This. All of this.
this is our miracle.

512
00:57:24.963 --> 00:57:27.792
We'’ve worked too hard not
to see it through together.

513
00:57:27.966 --> 00:57:30.403
Well. I wouldn'’t exactly
call it "work." now.

514
00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:34.973
You know what I mean.

515
00:57:35.626 --> 00:57:37.454
Come here.

516
00:57:37.628 --> 00:57:40.369
If I don'’t find them
in a few hours.
I'’ll turn back.

517
00:57:41.675 --> 00:57:43.721
Promise me.I promise.

518
00:57:46.288 --> 00:57:49.248
You do what needs to be done.
but don'’t you dare
leave us alone.

519
00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:52.991
Sure enough.

520
00:58:59.013 --> 00:59:00.711
I was hoping
you'’d return.

521
00:59:02.539 --> 00:59:05.237
Hey.
I'’m not gonna hurt you.

522
00:59:06.151 --> 00:59:07.500
Look at me.

523
00:59:07.674 --> 00:59:09.197
Couldn'’t hurt you
if I wanted to.

524
00:59:13.027 --> 00:59:15.203
Where is my family?

525
00:59:15.377 --> 00:59:16.727
What have you done
with them?

526
00:59:30.392 --> 00:59:31.959
I was afraid
you were dead.

527
00:59:35.702 --> 00:59:36.703
Come--

528
00:59:37.878 --> 00:59:39.488
Come warm yourself
by the fire.

529
00:59:41.708 --> 00:59:42.709
Please?

530
01:00:06.341 --> 01:00:07.952
Why are you doing
all this?

531
01:00:10.084 --> 01:00:11.216
Why are you here?

532
01:00:16.438 --> 01:00:18.571
They sent me out
to find you.

533
01:00:18.745 --> 01:00:20.268
Bring you back.

534
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:23.402
But I ain'’t gonna do that.

535
01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:26.405
I'’m never going back.

536
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:31.671
And...

537
01:00:34.848 --> 01:00:37.416
I don'’t know why I done
what I done.

538
01:00:40.114 --> 01:00:43.291
I-- I tried to run away.

539
01:00:43.465 --> 01:00:46.904
but then they--
they done this
to my hands. and...

540
01:00:50.429 --> 01:00:52.605
I didn'’t know what else
to do then.

541
01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.695
But that don'’t matter.
'’cause...

542
01:00:58.611 --> 01:01:00.613
I'’m the cause
of your suffering.

543
01:01:05.836 --> 01:01:08.142
Too much suffering.

544
01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:14.496
I ain'’t gonna
cause no more.

545
01:01:27.379 --> 01:01:29.686
You'’ll ruin your hands
if you don'’t let them heal.

546
01:01:34.038 --> 01:01:35.561
They'’re already ruined.

547
01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.281
Where'’d you find
that horse?

548
01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:02.719
A rancher pulled me
from the water.

549
01:02:04.895 --> 01:02:07.245
So. you stole it?Borrowed it.

550
01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:13.730
I have every intention
of returning him
once I get Fable back.

551
01:02:16.645 --> 01:02:17.864
Tell me you'’re jokin'’.

552
01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.260
You'’re going back
to them fiends
for a horse?

553
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:26.264
He'’s the only family
I got left.

554
01:02:28.222 --> 01:02:29.615
That'’s suicide.

555
01:02:31.443 --> 01:02:34.228
Either way.
I'’ll end up
with my family.

556
01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.024
We can return after the thaw.
if you'’d like.

557
01:02:47.198 --> 01:02:48.634
Bury '’em proper.

558
01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:53.857
You'’d do that?

559
01:02:56.163 --> 01:02:57.774
If you'’d let me.

560
01:03:16.662 --> 01:03:17.837
Fucking bitch!

561
01:03:18.011 --> 01:03:20.884
Stole the arrowheads.
I know it.

562
01:03:21.972 --> 01:03:23.974
What are you
talking about?

563
01:03:24.148 --> 01:03:26.977
I made a cache of them
before we left.Well. now they'’re gone.

564
01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:29.022
Why would she steal
a bunch of scrap arrowheads?

565
01:03:29.196 --> 01:03:31.808
Cause it'’s the best proof
she'’s got!

566
01:03:31.982 --> 01:03:35.594
They could lead the law
right to us.
if she'’s turned on us.

567
01:03:35.768 --> 01:03:39.772
Felix. saddle up.
find Cass
and bring her back!

568
01:03:39.946 --> 01:03:41.208
I'’m doing it.

569
01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:42.775
I'’ll do it.

570
01:03:42.949 --> 01:03:45.125
Sit the fuck down. junior.
This is man'’s work.

571
01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:48.520
Hey.
you bring her back alive.

572
01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:52.785
If you harm her.
I'’ll know about it.

573
01:03:52.959 --> 01:03:55.266
I won'’t harm her any worse
than you already have.

574
01:03:56.876 --> 01:03:59.661
They'’re my arrowheads.
I'’m doing it.

575
01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:04.014
Okay. If you don'’t.
it'’s your neck!

576
01:04:05.015 --> 01:04:08.105
Rhys.
don'’t make it mine!

577
01:06:00.608 --> 01:06:01.827
Good evening.

578
01:06:03.524 --> 01:06:05.396
Can I get me some
of that?

579
01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:07.746
I'’ll pay if you want.

580
01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:08.965
Oh.

581
01:06:16.537 --> 01:06:17.669
No trouble.

582
01:06:17.843 --> 01:06:19.671
Obliged to you.

583
01:06:21.455 --> 01:06:24.545
You walked all the way
from Wicker?
In the dark?

584
01:06:26.721 --> 01:06:28.288
I should'’ve charged you
for the coffee.

585
01:06:29.463 --> 01:06:30.508
Mmm.

586
01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:35.252
What you know
about these?

587
01:06:38.603 --> 01:06:40.431
Not worth the price
of the coffee.

588
01:06:40.605 --> 01:06:43.347
Not looking to sell them.
Asking what you know.

589
01:06:43.521 --> 01:06:47.264
Okay. Well. that'’s--
that'’s handmade. so--

590
01:06:47.438 --> 01:06:51.833
I only do
first-quality stuff here.
so thank you. but no. thank you.

591
01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:53.096
That'’s not what I asked.

592
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:55.228
I don'’t know anything
about them.

593
01:06:56.403 --> 01:06:58.014
And neither do you.

594
01:06:58.188 --> 01:07:00.103
Go home. friend.

595
01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:19.122
Can I have a look
at '’em?

596
01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:24.127
You know what?
I-It'’s getting late.
I think I'’ll--

597
01:07:29.523 --> 01:07:32.352
You got a name?To hell with you!

598
01:07:32.526 --> 01:07:34.267
Okay.

599
01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:40.491
You ain'’t got a gun?

600
01:07:40.665 --> 01:07:43.233
No.

601
01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:45.931
Hey. you stay right there.
friend.

602
01:07:46.932 --> 01:07:48.847
Hey there.

603
01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:56.942
Sorry. sorry. sorry.

604
01:07:58.335 --> 01:08:00.424
Sorry.
I'’m sorry. I'’m sorry.

605
01:08:00.598 --> 01:08:03.949
This man I just nailed
to the bar. who is he?

606
01:08:04.123 --> 01:08:05.733
I'’ve never seen him before
in my life.

607
01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:12.044
He owns
the Wicker Creek Ranch!

608
01:08:12.218 --> 01:08:13.611
I want a name. old man.

609
01:08:13.785 --> 01:08:15.700
Sir. I do not know.You ain'’t gotta do that.

610
01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:18.137
Erik! Erik!
His name is Erik!

611
01:08:18.311 --> 01:08:19.443
That'’s enough. now.

612
01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:23.969
He has a pregnant wife!
He has a pregnant wife!

613
01:08:24.143 --> 01:08:25.275
Thank you.

614
01:08:25.449 --> 01:08:29.888
Now. Mr. Erik
with the pregnant wife

615
01:08:30.062 --> 01:08:32.891
from Wicker Creek Ranch.

616
01:08:33.065 --> 01:08:34.632
where'’d you get
them arrowheads?

617
01:08:36.938 --> 01:08:39.071
Where'’d you find them?

618
01:08:39.245 --> 01:08:40.420
No. no.

619
01:08:40.594 --> 01:08:43.031
I-- I found them
in some trees.

620
01:08:43.206 --> 01:08:44.598
They led me here.

621
01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:45.817
What are you lookin'’ for?

622
01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:50.343
Could you--
Could you not
hurt him no more. Please?

623
01:08:50.517 --> 01:08:54.042
Tell me
what I want to know.
and I'’ll consider it.

624
01:08:55.827 --> 01:08:58.090
M-My horse.
She stole my horse.

625
01:08:58.264 --> 01:08:59.874
Who?

626
01:09:00.048 --> 01:09:02.094
I don'’t know!
She ain'’t never
told me her name.

627
01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:13.801
No! No! No!

628
01:09:24.638 --> 01:09:26.379
No!
Good Lord have mercy!

629
01:09:26.553 --> 01:09:28.120
Oh!

630
01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:45.355
Mr. Erik?
Mr. Erik?

631
01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:48.662
Looks like you and me'’s
partners now.

632
01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:51.317
Let'’s go find your horse.

633
01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:09.422
Why don'’t you carry a gun.
rancher?

634
01:10:10.467 --> 01:10:11.729
You lose it?

635
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.822
In the war. I done pointed
too many a gun
at too many men.

636
01:10:17.996 --> 01:10:19.040
and. um...

637
01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:23.915
just won'’t do it
no more.

638
01:10:25.873 --> 01:10:27.701
Well.
that'’s a pretty notion.

639
01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:30.922
Pretty fuckin'’ stupid.

640
01:10:33.141 --> 01:10:34.491
You see any more?

641
01:10:59.342 --> 01:11:01.866
Cassidy.
good to see you again.

642
01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:04.956
But...

643
01:11:06.174 --> 01:11:09.003
you ain'’t got the strength
to pull that trigger.

644
01:11:10.744 --> 01:11:11.832
Do you?

645
01:11:14.705 --> 01:11:16.837
Go on. rancher.
Fetch.

646
01:12:01.578 --> 01:12:02.796
Mm-hmm.

647
01:12:06.887 --> 01:12:09.281
Never cared
for the Schofield
much myself.

648
01:12:10.195 --> 01:12:12.893
Too much maintenance.
Mmm.

649
01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:18.464
Where'’s the girl?

650
01:12:19.683 --> 01:12:21.162
She never came out
of the water.

651
01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:22.773
Don'’t lie to me.

652
01:12:22.947 --> 01:12:24.209
I'’m not.

653
01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:25.471
Why did you come back here?

654
01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:27.604
Give these folks
a proper burial.

655
01:12:27.778 --> 01:12:29.606
More than you'’ve ever
done for anyone.

656
01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.783
They get where they'’re going
one way or another.

657
01:12:34.872 --> 01:12:38.832
Come on.
Get on your horse.
Let'’s go.

658
01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.400
What?

659
01:12:41.574 --> 01:12:43.402
You went through the trouble
of stealin'’ it.

660
01:12:43.576 --> 01:12:45.273
We ain'’t just
leavin'’ it behind.

661
01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:48.320
Don'’t give me
no trouble now.

662
01:12:48.494 --> 01:12:50.061
Ain'’t them hands
had enough?

663
01:12:50.235 --> 01:12:52.455
I was coming back anyhow.

664
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:56.937
I left them arrowheads
so I could find my way back.
Ain'’t no Natty Bumppo.

665
01:13:15.478 --> 01:13:18.219
Erik! Erik! Erik!

666
01:13:20.787 --> 01:13:24.356
Oh. God. Come on.

667
01:13:27.272 --> 01:13:29.405
Oh!
Oh. thank God.

668
01:13:29.579 --> 01:13:31.537
Yeah. praise him.

669
01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:33.800
Maybe not just yet.
though.

670
01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.541
I'’m so sorry.

671
01:13:39.719 --> 01:13:41.721
Oh. Yeah.

672
01:13:41.895 --> 01:13:46.117
My wife said it'’d make me
look more intimidating
to a predator.

673
01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:47.684
She'’s a smart woman.

674
01:13:47.858 --> 01:13:49.207
Sure enough.

675
01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:56.562
What did he do
to your hand?Nothing nice.

676
01:13:56.736 --> 01:13:58.999
Fella got some sort
of trademark.

677
01:14:09.227 --> 01:14:11.011
This will apply
enough pressure
to the wound

678
01:14:11.185 --> 01:14:13.013
without cutting off
circulation.

679
01:14:13.187 --> 01:14:15.407
How-- How do you know
how to do that?

680
01:14:16.756 --> 01:14:18.192
My father taught me.

681
01:14:19.324 --> 01:14:21.631
Well.
he taught my brother.
but I watched.

682
01:14:26.723 --> 01:14:28.986
You know. you'’re lucky
you ain'’t caught pneumonia yet.

683
01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.553
You can thank Nora
for that.

684
01:14:30.727 --> 01:14:32.816
You can thank her yourself.

685
01:14:35.993 --> 01:14:38.212
I should'’ve never
stolen your horse.

686
01:14:38.386 --> 01:14:39.692
Why did you?

687
01:14:58.755 --> 01:15:00.060
He do this?

688
01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:02.802
He was one of them.How many are there?

689
01:15:03.847 --> 01:15:06.066
Four to begin with.
One'’s already dead.

690
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.807
So. what you
gonna do now?

691
01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:12.116
Get our horses back.

692
01:15:15.075 --> 01:15:16.686
I can follow their tracks.

693
01:15:17.861 --> 01:15:20.211
We should move out
before sundown.

694
01:15:21.342 --> 01:15:22.866
You'’re not going
with me.

695
01:15:23.736 --> 01:15:25.825
Look here.

696
01:15:25.999 --> 01:15:30.177
From this point on.
I'’m choosing to accompany you
and get our horses back.

697
01:15:30.351 --> 01:15:33.572
After that.
you can make your mind up

698
01:15:33.746 --> 01:15:37.707
as to whether or not
you want to come back
to the ranch with me.

699
01:16:02.688 --> 01:16:05.473
Hey. easy. easy.
Easy. easy.

700
01:16:33.893 --> 01:16:35.591
You ain'’t gonna run away
no more.

701
01:16:41.031 --> 01:16:42.815
Ain'’t gonna walk
nowhere neither.

702
01:16:45.644 --> 01:16:47.646
Leave her.

703
01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.213
But she'’ll freeze.

704
01:16:49.387 --> 01:16:51.258
I'’m not asking.

705
01:16:52.825 --> 01:16:55.088
Go take care
of the horses.

706
01:17:23.726 --> 01:17:26.076
You'’re gonna bleed out
if that isn'’t
treated properly.

707
01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:27.164
Yeah.
I'’ll be all right.

708
01:17:27.338 --> 01:17:28.644
Bullshit.That language--

709
01:17:28.818 --> 01:17:30.123
You'’d rather die
of blood loss

710
01:17:30.297 --> 01:17:32.473
than see your life out
with Nora and your child?

711
01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:35.215
I can'’t let you
go in there alone.

712
01:17:35.389 --> 01:17:37.522
I'’m not some
helpless little girl
who can'’t fend for herself.

713
01:17:37.696 --> 01:17:39.567
Oh. come on.
You know that'’s not
what I meant.

714
01:17:39.742 --> 01:17:41.221
What did you mean?

715
01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.138
We'’re walking
into a snake pit.

716
01:17:45.312 --> 01:17:47.445
but I intend
to retrieve what'’s ours.

717
01:17:47.619 --> 01:17:48.707
So.
what we gonna do then?

718
01:17:48.881 --> 01:17:51.144
Just wait outside
until one of them

719
01:17:51.318 --> 01:17:53.277
decides to take the horses
for a stroll?

720
01:17:54.713 --> 01:17:56.280
For now.
we'’re gonna rest.

721
01:17:57.803 --> 01:17:59.413
Just for a minute.

722
01:18:10.163 --> 01:18:12.557
Yeah.

723
01:18:40.933 --> 01:18:44.589
She may not be able to run.
but she'’s still a traitor.

724
01:18:46.199 --> 01:18:50.290
Oh. she just needs
a little correction
every now and again.

725
01:18:50.464 --> 01:18:52.553
which I'’m happy to supply.

726
01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:54.381
That'’s not tough enough.

727
01:18:57.863 --> 01:18:59.386
She'’ll run on us again.

728
01:19:00.866 --> 01:19:02.563
What do you want me
to do?

729
01:19:04.478 --> 01:19:07.264
Cut the bitch'’s head off
and use it as a knocker
at the gate?

730
01:19:07.438 --> 01:19:09.745
If you can'’t control
your own woman.

731
01:19:09.919 --> 01:19:12.617
then she'’ll get us
all killed.

732
01:19:15.794 --> 01:19:18.144
Makes me wonder

733
01:19:18.318 --> 01:19:20.625
who'’s the real bitch here.

734
01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:31.462
She'’s not the one
pushing boundaries now. is she?

735
01:19:56.661 --> 01:19:59.142
I'’ve always wondered
how these things work.

736
01:20:27.126 --> 01:20:28.475
You still alive. old man?

737
01:20:28.649 --> 01:20:30.303
Fuck you!

738
01:20:31.957 --> 01:20:33.350
No. thanks.

739
01:20:33.524 --> 01:20:35.526
You ain'’t got the equipment
for it no more.

740
01:20:51.498 --> 01:20:52.499
Hey!

741
01:20:52.673 --> 01:20:54.762
Hey. what the hell
are you doing?

742
01:20:59.202 --> 01:21:00.681
I'’m doing
what need be done.

743
01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:04.990
Now.
you either stand with me.

744
01:21:05.164 --> 01:21:07.514
or you lie bloody
with him.

745
01:21:08.254 --> 01:21:09.690
Make your choice.

746
01:21:11.649 --> 01:21:13.390
Good boy.

747
01:21:17.046 --> 01:21:18.699
And you. old friend...

748
01:21:20.353 --> 01:21:22.225
...you already made
your choice.

749
01:21:22.965 --> 01:21:24.488
Die with it.

750
01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.850
Come here. girl.

751
01:21:39.024 --> 01:21:40.765
You see me?

752
01:21:40.939 --> 01:21:42.201
Can you see me?

753
01:21:44.595 --> 01:21:46.727
You may still have a chance.

754
01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:50.209
if you survive the night
with me

755
01:21:50.383 --> 01:21:52.690
and by my good graces.

756
01:21:54.344 --> 01:21:59.131
If you choose to betray me
like you did him. well...

757
01:22:01.873 --> 01:22:02.918
Do you see him?

758
01:22:03.092 --> 01:22:05.224
Do you see him?

759
01:22:07.096 --> 01:22:08.097
Good.

760
01:22:15.104 --> 01:22:16.540
When he dies.

761
01:22:17.889 --> 01:22:19.935
you drag him out back
with the rest of the waste.

762
01:22:25.592 --> 01:22:26.985
Now'’s fine.

763
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:53.664
Oh. no.

764
01:22:53.838 --> 01:22:56.232
Goddamn!
That'’s nasty!

765
01:23:31.658 --> 01:23:34.705
Cass? Cass?

766
01:23:36.402 --> 01:23:38.013
Here. drink this.

767
01:23:38.752 --> 01:23:39.927
Careful. It'’s hot.

768
01:23:42.495 --> 01:23:44.758
I'’ll bring more
when I can.

769
01:23:44.932 --> 01:23:47.892
Help me.

770
01:23:51.896 --> 01:23:53.724
Wait.It'’s almost morning.

771
01:23:58.598 --> 01:23:59.904
Felix!

772
01:24:00.861 --> 01:24:02.167
Felix!

773
01:24:03.603 --> 01:24:04.952
Felix!

774
01:24:06.954 --> 01:24:08.217
Help me!

775
01:24:09.087 --> 01:24:11.437
Help me!

776
01:24:12.873 --> 01:24:14.179
Quiet!

777
01:24:15.615 --> 01:24:16.616
You okay?

778
01:24:21.752 --> 01:24:24.581
Sounds close.
Any idea
where we are?

779
01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:26.670
No.

780
01:24:28.193 --> 01:24:31.196
We should wait until dawn
so we can see
where we'’re going.

781
01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:33.938
Who says she survives
that long?

782
01:25:19.331 --> 01:25:21.725
Why won'’t you
just kill me?

783
01:25:27.165 --> 01:25:29.515
Well. you dead
ain'’t what I want.

784
01:25:32.214 --> 01:25:34.129
I don'’t belong
to no man.

785
01:25:37.828 --> 01:25:40.135
You keep
telling yourself that.

786
01:25:41.527 --> 01:25:42.702
Maybe it'’ll come true.

787
01:26:00.633 --> 01:26:02.026
Fiery.

788
01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:21.263
There'’s a guard.

789
01:26:21.437 --> 01:26:23.134
He won'’t even know
I'’m there.

790
01:26:23.308 --> 01:26:26.093
Are you crazy?
We don'’t even know
how many are in there.

791
01:26:27.443 --> 01:26:29.967
I'’ll slip in.
get our horses.
and slip out.

792
01:26:30.141 --> 01:26:31.969
Then you can go.I'’m not leaving
without you.

793
01:26:32.143 --> 01:26:34.667
It don'’t make sense
for us to both go in there.

794
01:26:40.369 --> 01:26:42.762
I could use some help
with that wall.
though.

795
01:26:57.908 --> 01:26:59.649
Now. please.

796
01:28:27.867 --> 01:28:30.522
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?

797
01:28:30.696 --> 01:28:32.176
What'’s it look like?

798
01:28:56.592 --> 01:28:58.158
Take it.

799
01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.117
We don'’t have long.

800
01:29:17.526 --> 01:29:19.354
Go get the horses.
I'’ll meet you at the gate.

801
01:29:19.528 --> 01:29:21.573
Go. Go.

802
01:29:21.747 --> 01:29:22.748
Thank you.

803
01:29:37.676 --> 01:29:40.549
Come here.
Okay. It'’s okay.

804
01:29:40.723 --> 01:29:42.072
Are you ready to go?

805
01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:44.901
I'’ll be back for you.

806
01:29:49.688 --> 01:29:51.864
It'’s okay.
It'’s okay.

807
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:55.390
Almost there.

808
01:30:01.352 --> 01:30:05.051
How did Romeo and Juliet
end again?

809
01:30:06.009 --> 01:30:07.445
I forget.

810
01:30:21.067 --> 01:30:23.679
You'’re gonna be fine.
You'’re gonna make it.

811
01:30:30.381 --> 01:30:33.428
Take her. and keep her close.
She won'’t survive
in the cold.

812
01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:41.740
Take care of her
for me.Sure enough.

813
01:30:48.094 --> 01:30:50.793
Take this.
It'’s all I got left.

814
01:30:50.967 --> 01:30:52.229
Orion'’s still in there.

815
01:30:52.403 --> 01:30:54.492
Hold on.

816
01:30:57.669 --> 01:31:00.237
Run. Now.
Forget the horse.No. Orion!

817
01:31:00.411 --> 01:31:03.153
We got to get to move on.
Now or never.

818
01:31:26.829 --> 01:31:28.570
Finally grew a pair.
huh?

819
01:31:29.919 --> 01:31:31.529
Good boy.

820
01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:54.726
Jammed.

821
01:31:56.641 --> 01:32:00.079
It'’s pretty.
but useless.

822
01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:04.170
Like you
and that whore.

823
01:32:08.697 --> 01:32:09.698
Hey.

824
01:32:11.395 --> 01:32:13.702
You know
how your daddy died?

825
01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.531
You know?

826
01:32:16.705 --> 01:32:18.054
In--

827
01:32:18.924 --> 01:32:20.143
In the revolution.

828
01:32:20.317 --> 01:32:21.797
Oh.

829
01:32:22.537 --> 01:32:24.190
Suffering for his people?

830
01:32:25.104 --> 01:32:26.976
My daddy died a hero.

831
01:32:28.281 --> 01:32:29.761
Suffering ain'’t noble.

832
01:32:30.457 --> 01:32:31.850
It'’s just suffering.

833
01:34:11.167 --> 01:34:12.516
There you go.

834
01:34:13.996 --> 01:34:15.301
Good girl.

835
01:34:16.868 --> 01:34:19.262
All right. Hey.

836
01:34:21.656 --> 01:34:22.657
All right.

837
01:34:39.325 --> 01:34:40.370
Hey.

838
01:34:41.632 --> 01:34:42.677
Abigale.

839
01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:46.768
I know.You know nothin'’.

840
01:34:49.248 --> 01:34:50.815
Don'’t you do that
to yourself.

841
01:34:50.989 --> 01:34:52.991
Nothing good
can come from it.

842
01:34:55.864 --> 01:34:57.213
I miss them.

843
01:35:07.702 --> 01:35:08.877
What were their names?

844
01:35:13.142 --> 01:35:17.886
Abraham. Celeste.
and Tobias. my brother.

845
01:35:20.976 --> 01:35:23.195
They were all I had.
and I failed them.

846
01:35:23.369 --> 01:35:26.982
No. No. I don'’t--
I don'’t see it that way.

847
01:35:27.809 --> 01:35:29.158
Everything I know.

848
01:35:29.332 --> 01:35:30.942
I learned
from watching my parents.

849
01:35:31.116 --> 01:35:34.250
but I never got the chance
to do anything for myself.

850
01:35:39.864 --> 01:35:41.213
I didn'’t mean...

851
01:35:43.215 --> 01:35:44.216
I understand.

852
01:35:46.915 --> 01:35:47.872
You know. I was...

853
01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:55.358
brought up to keep quiet.
stay in my place
and not make a fuss.

854
01:35:55.532 --> 01:35:57.839
and that'’s exactly
what I did.

855
01:36:00.711 --> 01:36:03.235
I let them die.

856
01:36:03.409 --> 01:36:05.194
It'’s my fault.
and there ain'’t...

857
01:36:06.412 --> 01:36:09.241
nothing I can do
to bring them back.

858
01:36:09.415 --> 01:36:12.505
And there ain'’t nothing
I can do to make it up.
I can'’t be saved.

859
01:36:12.679 --> 01:36:14.769
Don'’t you start thinking
that way now.

860
01:36:17.336 --> 01:36:20.557
It wasn'’t you
who brought this hell
down upon your family.

861
01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:38.749
I don'’t think
she did either.

862
01:36:40.098 --> 01:36:42.884
She was a prisoner.
just like I was
intended to be.

863
01:36:45.147 --> 01:36:48.541
She saved my life twice.

864
01:36:48.715 --> 01:36:53.285
She could'’ve let them
turn me into whatever it was
that they made her be.

865
01:36:53.459 --> 01:36:55.418
But she'’s got a good heart.
deep down.

866
01:36:56.636 --> 01:36:58.421
I'’m not gonna
let her die here.

867
01:37:01.076 --> 01:37:04.775
I'’m sorry about Orion.

868
01:37:06.690 --> 01:37:10.825
Well. I'’m just glad
the both of y'’all safe.

869
01:37:15.699 --> 01:37:19.137
I'’ll feel better about that
once we'’re away
from this place.

870
01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:09.753
There. there. there.

871
01:38:24.072 --> 01:38:26.422
How far
to the homestead?

872
01:38:26.596 --> 01:38:29.991
Not far
if you'’re on a horse.
but walking...

873
01:38:32.167 --> 01:38:33.733
Should we rest
for a bit?

874
01:38:33.908 --> 01:38:35.648
I'’ll let you know.

875
01:39:39.886 --> 01:39:40.975
You'’re home.

876
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:42.628
We'’re home.

877
01:39:44.979 --> 01:39:46.632
Can you get her inside?

878
01:39:48.330 --> 01:39:49.548
Think I'’ll manage.

879
01:40:02.083 --> 01:40:03.562
Hey. boy.

880
01:40:05.347 --> 01:40:07.175
What you doing?

881
01:40:34.854 --> 01:40:37.031
Ah.

882
01:40:38.119 --> 01:40:39.903
Man of the house

883
01:40:40.077 --> 01:40:42.993
makes his triumphant return
from the dead.

884
01:40:44.168 --> 01:40:46.431
Nora. come here. love.

885
01:40:46.605 --> 01:40:48.825
No. No. No.

886
01:40:49.782 --> 01:40:52.611
She'’s happy here
with me.

887
01:40:54.570 --> 01:40:55.614
What you want?

888
01:40:57.138 --> 01:40:59.749
I want-- I want
what every man wants.

889
01:41:01.185 --> 01:41:03.100
A nice home. and...

890
01:41:07.017 --> 01:41:08.192
a loving family.

891
01:41:08.366 --> 01:41:09.802
Well. you ain'’t gonna
find it here.

892
01:41:09.976 --> 01:41:13.589
Oh.
I think I'’m gonna
like it here.

893
01:41:13.763 --> 01:41:16.026
My last family.

894
01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.897
it didn'’t work out
too good.

895
01:41:19.856 --> 01:41:21.118
Disobedient.

896
01:41:22.859 --> 01:41:25.731
These ladies shouldn'’t be
too hard to train.

897
01:41:25.905 --> 01:41:28.343
Nora. you all right?She'’s fine.

898
01:41:28.517 --> 01:41:30.910
Women in this house
can speak for themselves.

899
01:41:31.955 --> 01:41:33.565
But...

900
01:41:35.611 --> 01:41:37.308
...it ain'’t your house
no more.

901
01:41:37.482 --> 01:41:39.745
Well. it sure as hell
ain'’t yours!

902
01:41:44.968 --> 01:41:48.014
Let her go.
Please.

903
01:41:51.105 --> 01:41:52.541
And what if I don'’t?

904
01:41:52.715 --> 01:41:53.933
Huh?

905
01:41:54.108 --> 01:41:57.720
Oh. are you--
you gonna draw on me. huh?

906
01:41:58.764 --> 01:42:00.070
I ain'’t no gunslinger.

907
01:42:00.897 --> 01:42:02.942
No. no.

908
01:42:03.769 --> 01:42:05.293
You'’re just a rancher.

909
01:42:05.467 --> 01:42:09.471
I could use someone
to keep this place up.

910
01:42:10.994 --> 01:42:13.214
You can sleep
in the stable.

911
01:42:16.347 --> 01:42:19.089
Take the house.
Let them leave.

912
01:42:22.136 --> 01:42:23.876
And why would I
do that?

913
01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:27.053
Take your fucking hands
off my wife!

914
01:42:35.497 --> 01:42:39.675
I don'’t think you understand
the predicament
that you'’re in. rancher.

915
01:42:39.849 --> 01:42:44.462
You see. I'’m going to do more
than just put my hands on her.

916
01:42:44.636 --> 01:42:45.942
She ain'’t yours no more.

917
01:42:59.173 --> 01:43:01.610
What happened to
your pretty notions. rancher?

918
01:43:01.784 --> 01:43:03.786
I thought you weren'’t
pointing guns no more.

919
01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:07.877
Forgot to say.
that one'’s jammed.

920
01:43:10.009 --> 01:43:14.275
I'’m afraid I ain'’t got much use
for a crippled ranch hand.

921
01:43:14.449 --> 01:43:15.798
No!

922
01:43:19.628 --> 01:43:21.630
She ain'’t gonna be your whore.
None of us is.

923
01:43:26.852 --> 01:43:29.507
Well. you ain'’t.
that'’s for damn sure.

924
01:43:29.681 --> 01:43:30.682
No!

925
01:43:54.445 --> 01:43:56.447
Goddamn it!

926
01:44:18.426 --> 01:44:21.167
This is my house!

927
01:44:21.342 --> 01:44:23.692
And you bitches
will do as I say.

928
01:44:23.866 --> 01:44:27.304
Get your fucking hands
off of her.

929
01:44:46.628 --> 01:44:49.152
You'’re about
to breathe your last.

930
01:44:49.326 --> 01:44:52.634
And ain'’t nobody
ever loved you.

931
01:44:57.595 --> 01:45:00.903
You feel that?

932
01:45:23.534 --> 01:45:24.840
Sweet Jesus.

933
01:45:25.014 --> 01:45:26.929
Erik?
Erik. can you hear me?

934
01:45:27.495 --> 01:45:28.757
Erik?

935
01:45:28.931 --> 01:45:30.149
Erik?

936
01:45:30.324 --> 01:45:33.239
Oh. thank God.
Oh. Abigale. he'’s alive.

937
01:46:43.962 --> 01:46:46.748
There there. Cassie.
