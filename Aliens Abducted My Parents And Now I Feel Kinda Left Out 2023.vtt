00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:53.887
Anything?

4
00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.264
No.

5
00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:57.891
Huh. I don't get why
it's not working yet.

6
00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.518
Okay. read it off again.

7
00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:04.231
Oh. here we go.

8
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.817
Did we calibrate the rear glass?

9
00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:08.068
Yes.

10
00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.655
35 millimeter camera
attachment secured?

11
00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:13.615
Definitely.

12
00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.576
Took the lens cap off?

13
00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.663
Yeah. of course we
took the lens cap off.

14
00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:20.956
What do you think we are?

15
00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:22.541
But I think I do
know what's wrong.

16
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:25.419
Maybe we just need a
little Kipler elbow rub.

17
00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.588
What's a Kipler elbow rub?

18
00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:28.964
Observe. my son.

19
00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:31.925
Okay. so my father taught me
this and now I'm teaching you.

20
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.510
So you take your elbow.

21
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.722
and you just rub at the
problem area. right?

22
00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:37.514
Pay attention to the elbow.

23
00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:38.807
You paying attention?

24
00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:39.808
Yup.

25
00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:41.602
All the action
is in the elbow.

26
00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.729
And you snap (snapping
fingers) and that should do it.

27
00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.022
Take another look.

28
00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:47.608
It's working.

29
00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:50.068
Yeah.
Kipler elbow rub.

30
00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:51.945
No sign of the comet. though.

31
00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.114
Hey. patience. okay?

32
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.699
Jesper's Comet
has been traveling

33
00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.784
almost 10 years to get here.

34
00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.036
It'll get here.

35
00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:00.954
Hey.

36
00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:03.123
Listen. kiddo.

37
00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.416
There's actually something

38
00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:05.876
I've been meaning to
talk to you about.

39
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.921
So your mom and I-

40
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:11.215
Whose car is that?

41
00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:12.424
Oh. okay.

42
00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:13.342
Stay here.

43
00:02:13.342 --> 00:02:14.801
I'll be right back. 'kay?

44
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.220
But the comet!

45
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.137
30 Seconds.

46
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.013
Start the countdown. 'kay?

47
00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:21.850

48
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.895

87
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.719
We just stopped
like 30 minutes ago.

88
00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.221
Okay. well I need to go again.

89
00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:23.889
Maybe you have a UTI.

90
00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.182
You know. they make you urinate

91
00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:27.142
two to three times
more than usual.

92
00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.019
Evan. I don't have a UTI.

93
00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:30.270
We're only about 20
minutes from our new house.

94
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.063

95
00:04:31.063 --> 00:04:32.689
No. I cannot wait.

96
00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.276
Definitely sounds like
a urinary tract infection.

97
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.027
Okay.

98
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:42.074
Looks like there's a convenience
store .2 miles up the road.

99
00:04:42.074 --> 00:04:43.283
Maybe we can all grab
a snack while Itsy

100
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.618
flushes out her system.

how to use this thing?

outdated anyway.

Oh. we're lucky.

156
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.151

critical to a nice. easy flip.

157
00:07:24.403 --> 00:07:25.529

you a nice. easy flip.

I'm in my room.

163

to replace the insulation.

you take a picture of us

172
00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:07.196

173
00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:08.697
open-door policy.

174

run over to the neighbors

180
00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.241

181
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:53.575
And maybe a screwdriver.

182
00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.786
And some duct tape.
and a handful of screws.

183
00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:57.371
Heck. a spare door
if they've got one.

184
00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:00.874
Why can't we just go
to the hardware store?

185
00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:03.252
Uh. well. the hardware
store's about two hours away

186
00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:06.296
and we still have to unpack.
and do all that stuff.

187
00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:07.965
It'll be good for us
to meet the neighbors.

188
00:09:07.965 --> 00:09:09.883
And by us. you mean me. right?

189
00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.009
Uh. no.

190
00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:13.470
I mean you and Lewis and Clark.

191
00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.890
Orienteering.

192
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.808
Remember?

193
00:09:17.808 --> 00:09:19.017
Remember the maps and stuff?

194
00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:20.686
Yeah. I remember.

195
00:09:22.938 --> 00:09:24.982
Have fun.

196
00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:26.066
We've been walking
for 10 minutes

197
00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.985
and I haven't seen
a single neighbor.

198
00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:29.820
A single human neighbor.

199
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.698
We've seen prairie
dogs. gophers.

200
00:09:32.698 --> 00:09:34.116
sparrows. and grasshoppers-

201
00:09:34.116 --> 00:09:36.410
I'm gonna die out here!

202
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.202
Hey. look.

203
00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:38.453
There's a neighbor.

204
00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:44.168
Looks like the road
curves up and around.

205
00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:45.502
Oh. offroading.

206
00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.546
I'm right behind ya.

207
00:09:47.546 --> 00:09:50.924
Another common neighbor is
the prairie rattlesnake.

208
00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:52.676
who will not
hesitate to bite you-

209
00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:53.927
Shut up. Evan.

210
00:09:56.013 --> 00:09:57.848
Let's go to this house.

211
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:20.621
Hello.

212
00:10:21.872 --> 00:10:22.915
I think there's
someone back here.

213
00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:27.377
You know. on second thought.

214
00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.880
tomorrow might be a better
day for an adventure.

215
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.923
I thought you
liked adventuring.

216
00:10:30.923 --> 00:10:32.299
Let's go.

217
00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:33.091
Come on. Itsy.

218
00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:33.884
I just wanna go home.

219
00:10:33.884 --> 00:10:35.469
Evan. it's fine.

220
00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:38.722
I've got a bad feeling
about this place.

221
00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:40.098
Evan. I thought you
wanted to come out here.

222
00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:40.891
I just don't want...

223
00:10:50.943 --> 00:10:51.985
I think there's
someone in there.

224
00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.028
Oh. really?

225
00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:54.488
What gave that away?

226
00:10:54.488 --> 00:10:56.573
The mysterious noises. or
the blood-curdling scream?

227
00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.659
Okay. Ev. can you just
help me open the door?

228
00:10:58.659 --> 00:10:59.785
Hard pass.

229
00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:00.702
Evan!

230
00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.418
Okay. can we go now?

231
00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.211
No.

232
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:11.046
What does that say?

233
00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:12.381
Unidentified flying object-

234
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:13.966
Intruder alert!

235
00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:16.134
No. let go of me!

236
00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.719
Save yourself!

237
00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:19.972
Okay. let's go!

238
00:11:21.265 --> 00:11:23.809
It smelled of dust.
talcum powder. and danger.

239
00:11:23.809 --> 00:11:25.853
But I had to know
what was in that shed.

240
00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:26.854
You were terrified.

241
00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:28.188
Of course.

242
00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:30.274
But what is bravery but
courage in the face of fear?

243
00:11:30.274 --> 00:11:32.776
So I pulled open that
40-pound hinged door-

244
00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:34.736
We pulled open.

245
00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.114
I pulled open that
40-pound hinged door

246
00:11:37.114 --> 00:11:39.741
and single-handedly battled
that masked villain.

247
00:11:41.285 --> 00:11:43.829
And then I shouted.
"Save yourself. Itsy.

248
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:44.872
"I'll save you."

249
00:11:44.872 --> 00:11:45.664
Good job. kiddo.

250
00:11:45.664 --> 00:11:46.790
Then I grabbed him.

251
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.917
I'm sure it was real scary.

252
00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.711
I'll check it out.

253
00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:52.171
I'm gonna die here. Mom.

254
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.380
Die.

255
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.007
I'll have your
father go check it out.

256
00:11:55.007 --> 00:11:57.134
I'm sure the neighbors were
just in the middle of something.

257
00:11:57.134 --> 00:11:58.468
That's not what I mean.

258
00:11:58.468 --> 00:11:59.928
I have to get back to the city.

259
00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.013
There's nothing here for me.

260
00:12:01.013 --> 00:12:03.140
Nothing but
possibilities. you mean.

261
00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.725
You can do whatever
you want here.

262
00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:06.018
You should take the extra room

263
00:12:06.018 --> 00:12:07.978
and turn it into a darkroom
for your photographs.

264
00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:08.979
That'll be fun.

265
00:12:08.979 --> 00:12:09.980
I can't stay here.

266
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.649
And the second I
graduate. I'm gone.

267
00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:13.942
Uh huh.

268
00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.068
With what money?

269
00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.113
Scholarship money.

270
00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:19.281
Oh. I like the sound of that.

271
00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:20.908
Does that mean you're
gonna study more?

272
00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:21.909
No!

273
00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:24.286
You're not going to die. Itsy.

274
00:12:24.286 --> 00:12:25.579
I am.

275
00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:27.664
Things are gonna
get better soon.

276
00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:28.790
Soon is a relative term.

277
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.459
I need you to be more specific.

278
00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:31.752
Hm. tomorrow.

279
00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.087
What's tomorrow?

280
00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:35.339
First day of school.

281
00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:37.799
I am not going
to school tomorrow.

282
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.844
Have fun
at school. guys.

283
00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:42.095
Shall we?

284
00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.472
You're not in high school.

285
00:12:43.472 --> 00:12:45.224
Pebble Falls is K through 12.

286
00:12:45.224 --> 00:12:47.476
and that includes me. baby.

287
00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:51.271
Okay.

288
00:13:05.369 --> 00:13:09.998
Micah Merrill. please
report to the front desk.

289
00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:15.295
Is something funny?

290
00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:16.964
Oh. not at all.

291
00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:21.927
We're just wondering if you're
sure you wanted to sit there.

292
00:13:23.095 --> 00:13:25.472
You're welcome to
come sit with us.

293
00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:27.599
By the looks of things.
it's gonna take a little bit

294
00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:31.770
for you to make friends.
but I'm happy to help out.

295
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:32.521
For now.

296
00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:39.653
You know. you guys seem
really cool. but I'm good here.

297
00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:40.988
Suit yourself.

298
00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:44.408
How was everybody's weekend?

299
00:13:44.408 --> 00:13:47.911
I said. how was
everybody's weekend?

300
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:50.581
Good.

301
00:13:50.581 --> 00:13:51.957
Who said that?

302
00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:56.420
Oh. you must be one
of our new students.

303
00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.713
Would you like to stand up

304
00:13:57.713 --> 00:14:00.382
and tell us a little
about yourself?

305
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:08.182
Um. my
name is Itsy Levan.

306
00:14:08.182 --> 00:14:08.932
I'm 17.

307
00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:11.977
My dream job

308
00:14:11.977 --> 00:14:13.187
is to work at the "New York
Times" as a journalist.

309
00:14:13.187 --> 00:14:14.438
No. no. no. no. no.

310
00:14:14.438 --> 00:14:16.190
That's too "new kid at school."

311
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.566
Just tell us your name

312
00:14:17.566 --> 00:14:20.360
and three things you
think are cheujy.

313
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.446
and what cheujy means.

314
00:14:22.446 --> 00:14:23.614
You mean cheugy?

315
00:14:26.158 --> 00:14:28.285
Mr. Kipler. if you
can't use the doorknob

316
00:14:28.285 --> 00:14:31.163
like everyone else. you need
to remove whatever apparatus

317
00:14:31.163 --> 00:14:33.582
is preventing you from doing so.

318
00:14:33.582 --> 00:14:35.709
It's not an
apparatus. Mr. Sterman.

319
00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.628
it's my gravity
equilibrium suit.

320
00:14:37.628 --> 00:14:38.921
I need to acclimate.

321
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:40.923
Do they not have
doorknobs in space?

322
00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.800
Calvin. get your butt in here!

323
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.220
Okay. okay. hold on.

324
00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.311
Glad you could make it.

325
00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:56.939
I'm sure the commute from the
stratosphere was terrible.

326
00:14:56.939 --> 00:14:58.232
You mean the exosphere?

327
00:14:58.232 --> 00:14:59.691
The stratosphere is the
layer right above us.

328
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:01.443
Nothing orbits in
the stratosphere.

329
00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:02.694
What is that smell?

330
00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.780
Oh it's uh. coconut
oil and squid ink.

331
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.114
A natural lubricant

332
00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:07.699
for me to slip in and
out of my spacesuits.

333
00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:09.243
Just take a seat. Mr. Kipler.

334
00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:09.993
Okay.

335
00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:13.497
Still happy with
your seat choice?

336
00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:15.707
Oh. whoops. sorry.

337
00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:16.500
Eww!

338
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.251
Oh. eww!

339
00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:20.879
So
today is the 11th.

340
00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:22.381
So you know what that means?

341
00:15:22.381 --> 00:15:24.550
That's right. it's
group activity day.

342
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.094
Yeah. yeah. you
expressive radical.

343
00:15:27.094 --> 00:15:28.428
Get it?

344
00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:31.056
Little mathematics
joke for you guys.

345
00:15:32.808 --> 00:15:36.186
Anywho. since you all didn't
like that last scenario-

346
00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.981
How did you find
my command center?

347
00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:39.940
Hmm?

348
00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.734
That was you outside
my shed. right?

349
00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:44.903
You hit my arm with a stick.

350
00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:46.530
Oh. yeah!

351
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:47.823
Sorry. me and my brother

352
00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:49.950
were just looking
for a screwdriver.

353
00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:50.826
And a door.

354
00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:53.412
So what was going on in there?

355
00:15:53.412 --> 00:15:55.414
Uh. it's top secret for
anyone who isn't a friendly.

356
00:15:55.414 --> 00:15:57.875
Well. I come in peace.

357
00:15:57.875 --> 00:15:59.001
How do you know about that?

358
00:15:59.001 --> 00:15:59.918
About what?

359
00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:01.879
The galactic sign for peace.

360
00:16:01.879 --> 00:16:03.172
I mean. I'm glad that I
can trust someone else

361
00:16:03.172 --> 00:16:06.383
on this planet. but where'd
you learn about that?

362
00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:08.844
From "Star Trek?"

363
00:16:08.844 --> 00:16:11.096
What trek. and to what star?

364
00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:12.723
All
right. everyone.

365
00:16:12.723 --> 00:16:14.766
You and the person sitting
next to you have 15 minutes

366
00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:17.019
to figure out how
long it takes a ship

367
00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:19.980
traveling at the speed of
light to get to Jupiter.

368
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.190
Go!

369
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.068
Okay. so it says
that the speed of light

370
00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:27.362
is one billion. eighty
million kilometers an hour-

371
00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:28.280
Wrong.

372
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.698
It is one billion.

373
00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:31.658
seventy nine million
kilometers per hour. actually.

374
00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:32.576
But the teacher-

375
00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:34.077
Is a adequate math teacher.

376
00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:35.329
however. he is woefully ignorant

377
00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:37.372
when it comes to
interstellar travel.

378
00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:39.208
Oh. what. and
you're an expert?

379
00:16:39.208 --> 00:16:41.251
As a matter of fact. I am.

380
00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:44.087
Okay. well then you
can figure this one out.

381
00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:45.631
All right.

382
00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:47.466
Well. first we have to adjust
the size of the vessel.

383
00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:48.258
We do?

384
00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:49.551
Well. yeah.

385
00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:50.844
Any spacecraft traveling
at the speed of light

386
00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:52.262
it has to be at
least 1/3 the size

387
00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:55.015
of today's clunky.
120-meter rocketships.

388
00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.935
So like. what. 50 meters?

389
00:16:59.102 --> 00:16:59.853
40.

390
00:17:01.522 --> 00:17:03.398
You can calculate space
travel but not fractions?

391
00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:05.567
Fractions will be obsolete
within the next 100 years.

392
00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:07.986
So. what day will it be leaving?

393
00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:08.987
I don't know.

394
00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:10.072
Why does that matter?

395
00:17:10.072 --> 00:17:11.698
Because depending
on the time of year.

396
00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:15.744
Jupiter will obviously be in
a different orbital position.

397
00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:17.746
Yes?

398
00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:18.997
What day is the
spacecraft leaving?

399
00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:19.915
Why does that matter?

400
00:17:21.667 --> 00:17:22.960
Okay. yeah.

401
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.336
Because depending
on the time of year.

402
00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:27.506
Jupiter will obviously be in
a different orbital position.

403
00:17:27.506 --> 00:17:29.049
Huh. that's a great point.

404
00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:30.926
Let's say tomorrow.

405
00:17:30.926 --> 00:17:32.594
So if we were
leaving tomorrow.

406
00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:35.681
it would be about 900 million
kilometers away from Jupiter.

407
00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:36.974
But the board says 1.200.

408
00:17:36.974 --> 00:17:37.891
Wrong again.

409
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.226
Our spacecraft will be traveling

410
00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:40.894
to Jupiter's future location.
so the curved flight path

411
00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.604
will be 1.4 times longer.

412
00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:45.482
We would get there in about
an hour and 15 minutes.

413
00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:47.192
How do you know all this?

414
00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:48.819
Just common sense. really.

415
00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:53.282
If it was common sense.
I would know it. too.

416
00:17:53.282 --> 00:17:57.786
You know. maybe you should
go on more "Star Treks."

417
00:18:01.874 --> 00:18:03.000
I'm Heather.

418
00:18:04.543 --> 00:18:05.878
I'm Itsy.

419
00:18:05.878 --> 00:18:07.171
I know.

420
00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:09.423
I feel really good about
us being besties now.

421
00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:11.383
Especially 'cause I was the
lead in this years' play.

422
00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:13.969
"My Fair Ladybug" and I'm also
running for class president.

423
00:18:13.969 --> 00:18:16.305
which everyone says I've
already got in the bag.

424
00:18:16.305 --> 00:18:19.099
So I'm just a really
good person to know.

425
00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.684
Anyway. I'm also the head editor

426
00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:22.019
for our Young Journalists Club.

427
00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:24.062
and I wanted to
invite you to enter

428
00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:26.899
into a writing competition
for NYU with me.

429
00:18:26.899 --> 00:18:28.942
The winners get to go to
their summer writing program.

430
00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:30.903
Oh my gosh. that's awesome.

431
00:18:30.903 --> 00:18:32.154
So where's this program?

432
00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:33.739
Right in New York City. baby.

433
00:18:33.739 --> 00:18:36.033
That's amazing; I'm in.

434
00:18:36.033 --> 00:18:37.409
So what's the subject about?

435
00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:39.453
The prompt is to write
about the strangest thing

436
00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:40.954
in your hometown.

437
00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:42.206
Oh. well I just moved here.

438
00:18:42.206 --> 00:18:43.790
so I don't know much
about Pebble Falls.

439
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:44.875
but I'm sure I
can figure it out.

440
00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:48.003
Oh. no. I've already
figured that part out.

441
00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:51.715
The problem is because of a
certain incident in 2nd grade

442
00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:55.219
involving a fairy tea party
and a mock alien invasion.

443
00:18:55.219 --> 00:18:57.971
I'm unable to do the research
on the perfect subject.

444
00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:00.098
But that's where you come in.

445
00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:01.308
I'm still confused.

446
00:19:01.308 --> 00:19:02.601
What's the subject?

447
00:19:02.601 --> 00:19:04.895
Not so much a what. but a who.

448
00:19:04.895 --> 00:19:05.979
Anyone here that cares
about the future of the world?

449
00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:09.566
I'm raising money to
go to outer space.

450
00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:11.818
So. I'm actually
gonna be streaming it.

451
00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.403
Anybody that wants
to see the stream?

452
00:19:14.947 --> 00:19:16.782
Hey. could you spare some
money for my grandma's surgery?

453
00:19:16.782 --> 00:19:18.534
Just kidding. it's
way cooler than that.

454
00:19:18.534 --> 00:19:19.993
It's for outer space.

455
00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:21.203
No?

456
00:19:21.203 --> 00:19:22.538
You want me to
write about that guy?

457
00:19:22.538 --> 00:19:23.830
The requirements
are to write about

458
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.207
the strangest thing
in your hometown.

459
00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:27.042
That is definitely
Calvin Kipler.

460
00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:28.794
Obviously. he's not
gonna open up to me.

461
00:19:28.794 --> 00:19:31.296
but if you and I work
to write this thing.

462
00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:33.590
we'll be in New York
City in no time.

463
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.801
Hey guys. I need to
acclimate this suit.

464
00:19:35.801 --> 00:19:36.844
I can't take it off.

465
00:19:37.636 --> 00:19:39.221
Ooh. my nunchucks.

466
00:19:39.221 --> 00:19:40.973
Unless. you want to stay
in Pebble Falls forever.

467
00:19:40.973 --> 00:19:42.975
No. no. definitely not.

468
00:19:42.975 --> 00:19:45.143
So what do you think I
should do to get started?

469
00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:47.020
You're a journalist. right?

470
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.230
You'll figure it out.

471
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.523
Bye.

472
00:19:49.523 --> 00:19:51.108
Let me
hear you say. "Hey."

473
00:19:51.108 --> 00:19:51.984
if you wanna give me some
money for outer space.

474
00:19:51.984 --> 00:19:53.026
Hey.

475
00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:53.777
Who said that?

476
00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.491
Whoops. sorry.

477
00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:00.325
Didn't realize anybody
was sitting here.

478
00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:02.703
No. you can stay.

479
00:20:02.703 --> 00:20:04.913
But don't you wanna sit here?

480
00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:06.957
Yeah. with you.

481
00:20:06.957 --> 00:20:07.958
Sit.

482
00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:15.048
So. you live in Pebble Falls?

483
00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:16.133
Mm hm.

484
00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:18.051
I guess that was
a dumb question.

485
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:20.387
Um. how long have
you lived here for?

486
00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:22.306
Uh. 207 months.

487
00:20:22.306 --> 00:20:24.933
Or 103 weeks and two days.

488
00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:27.895
I like the accuracy.

489
00:20:29.855 --> 00:20:32.107
Where did you come up with that?

490
00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:33.025
A sandwich?

491
00:20:33.025 --> 00:20:35.360
No. like. the Doritos
on the sandwich?

492
00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:38.197
Oh. garnish.

493
00:20:38.197 --> 00:20:38.906
It's cool.

494
00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:41.950
What's the town like?

495
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.746
It's an adequate
place of residence.

496
00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:50.876
What are you doing?

497
00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:54.171
Okay. that's gross.

498
00:20:54.171 --> 00:20:54.963
No. it's not.

499
00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:55.923
Here. try one.

500
00:20:55.923 --> 00:20:58.008
No. maybe another time.

501
00:20:59.343 --> 00:21:01.803
So I actually wanted to
talk to you about something.

502
00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:03.639
Something supernatural.

503
00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:06.767
Go on.

504
00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:12.439
So late last night I was
walking in front of my house.

505
00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:14.900
and I was listening to some
music on my headphones-

506
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.527
What kind of headphones?

507
00:21:16.527 --> 00:21:18.278
I don't know. that's not
important to the story-

508
00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:21.448
Everything is
important to the story.

509
00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:22.824
Marshall cans.

510
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.410
What song?

511
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.286
Elton John.

512
00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:27.246
What song?

513
00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:29.831
"Tiny Dancer."

514
00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:33.293
So I was listening
to "Tiny Dancer"

515
00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:34.920
on my Marshall headphones.

516
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.464
when all of a sudden
the music cuts out.

517
00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.800
And then I look up
and the street lamps.

518
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.760
they're flashing. going crazy.

519
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.054
And then all the
sudden they just stop.

520
00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:46.890
Yeah. and then
everything goes quiet.

521
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.685
The crickets and the birds.
everything just stops.

522
00:21:49.685 --> 00:21:52.062
And then right above me
this series of lights

523
00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:55.566
starts flashing. and
it's like red and white.

524
00:21:55.566 --> 00:21:57.442
and then splashes of blue.

525
00:21:57.442 --> 00:22:00.445
Then as soon as it arrived.
it just disappeared.

526
00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:01.280
It just went whoosh.

527
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:01.989
It was gone.

528
00:22:01.989 --> 00:22:03.532
Then what?

529
00:22:03.532 --> 00:22:07.077
Then everything
went back to normal.

530
00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:08.954
So what's your take on it?

531
00:22:08.954 --> 00:22:10.414
I know what that is.

532
00:22:10.414 --> 00:22:13.083
Sounds like what you
encountered is a Super Galaxy.

533
00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:14.168
A Super Galaxy?

534
00:22:14.168 --> 00:22:16.753
Is that some sort
of alien technology?

535
00:22:16.753 --> 00:22:18.589
A celestial disturbance?

536
00:22:18.589 --> 00:22:20.340
An intersection
between our world

537
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.843
and another parallel universe?

538
00:22:22.843 --> 00:22:24.011
Nope.

539
00:22:24.011 --> 00:22:25.137
A Lockheed C-5 Super Galaxy

540
00:22:25.137 --> 00:22:27.681
is a large military
transport aircraft.

541
00:22:27.681 --> 00:22:28.724
Wait. what?

542
00:22:29.725 --> 00:22:30.684
That's rude.

543
00:22:32.352 --> 00:22:34.479
But the crickets went silent.

544
00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:36.148
Crickets go silent when
anything gets too close.

545
00:22:36.148 --> 00:22:37.608
I know. this was different

546
00:22:37.608 --> 00:22:39.610
because the lights
were flickering.

547
00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.361
Super Galaxies are equipped
with a frequency jammer

548
00:22:41.361 --> 00:22:43.197
that's similar to what the
old sodium-vapor streetlights

549
00:22:43.197 --> 00:22:44.198
work off of.

550
00:22:44.198 --> 00:22:45.782
They need to be replaced.

551
00:22:45.782 --> 00:22:47.576
I've gone to the city council
about this several times.

552
00:22:47.576 --> 00:22:50.162
and they're always like.
"Ooh. those work just fine."

553
00:22:50.162 --> 00:22:51.872
and "Oh. we don't
have the budget."

554
00:22:51.872 --> 00:22:54.541
or "Uh. don't stand on the
podium." blah. blah. blah.

555
00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:59.421
Okay. but then how do you
explain the sequence of notes?

556
00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:00.547
Sequence of notes?

557
00:23:00.547 --> 00:23:01.548
Did I not tell you?

558
00:23:01.548 --> 00:23:02.883
When the lights were flashing.

559
00:23:02.883 --> 00:23:04.968
there was a sequence of
notes that was playing.

560
00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:05.969
Twice.

561
00:23:07.095 --> 00:23:10.098
Can you remember these notes?

562
00:23:10.098 --> 00:23:11.350
Yeah. probably.

563
00:23:15.103 --> 00:23:16.647
Very well.

564
00:23:16.647 --> 00:23:18.065
I have a piano in my workshop.

565
00:23:18.065 --> 00:23:20.526
Meet me in the parking lot
10 minutes after the bell.

566
00:23:20.526 --> 00:23:21.276
Okay.

567
00:23:23.362 --> 00:23:25.030
Yes. yes. yes. yes!

568
00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:36.250
You ready?

569
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.376
Evan. what are you doing here?

570
00:23:37.376 --> 00:23:38.961
What do you mean?

571
00:23:38.961 --> 00:23:40.128
This is where Mom and
Dad told us to meet them.

572
00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:41.129
Okay. well. I'm
not going home.

573
00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:42.172
I have stuff to do.

574
00:23:42.172 --> 00:23:43.340
What kind of stuff?

575
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.591
Secret stuff.

576
00:23:44.591 --> 00:23:45.926
What kind of secret stuff?

577
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:53.392
Wow.

578
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:59.773
Crap; Evan. just don't
say anything embarrassing.

579
00:24:01.692 --> 00:24:02.818
All right. you ready to go?

580
00:24:02.818 --> 00:24:03.610
Holy moly!

581
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.988
This is incredible!

582
00:24:05.988 --> 00:24:07.030
Wait. sorry.

583
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:07.823
Who is this?

584
00:24:07.823 --> 00:24:08.866
Evan Lean.

585
00:24:10.117 --> 00:24:12.035
So your name is spelled
Evan. and then an L.

586
00:24:12.035 --> 00:24:13.537
and another Evan?

587
00:24:14.413 --> 00:24:15.998
I think you're my hero.

588
00:24:18.166 --> 00:24:18.959
Hey. kids.

589
00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:20.627
Hey. hop in.

590
00:24:20.627 --> 00:24:21.879
Some guy's listing a bunch of
half-used cream paint buckets

591
00:24:21.879 --> 00:24:22.671
for a dollar each.

592
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:23.964
We gotta go.

593
00:24:23.964 --> 00:24:25.174
Oh. are we not
going to my house?

594
00:24:25.174 --> 00:24:26.300
Well. hello there.

595
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.885
Who might you be?

596
00:24:27.885 --> 00:24:29.261
Well. that's a
complicated question.

597
00:24:29.261 --> 00:24:31.096
But for now. suffice it to
say that I'm an astrologist.

598
00:24:31.096 --> 00:24:32.389
junior SETI researcher.
pog champion.

599
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:33.891
Smithsonian star
cataloger. omnivore.

600
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:35.684
and proud member
of the human race.

601
00:24:35.684 --> 00:24:36.935
You can call me Calvin Kipler.

602
00:24:36.935 --> 00:24:38.896
Teach me everything.

603
00:24:38.896 --> 00:24:40.898
Me and Calvin are just
working on a research project

604
00:24:40.898 --> 00:24:42.232
at his house. so that's all.

605
00:24:42.232 --> 00:24:43.025
End of story.

606
00:24:43.025 --> 00:24:44.067
Sounds fun.

607
00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:44.860
What's the project?

608
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.861
So it's a. um-

609
00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:47.279
It's top secret.

610
00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:48.864
Right. right.

611
00:24:48.864 --> 00:24:52.034
Yeah. so we'll be at his
house working on the project.

612
00:24:52.034 --> 00:24:52.868
For school.

613
00:24:52.868 --> 00:24:54.119
Well. all right.

614
00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:55.787
That sounds like a plan.

615
00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:57.122
All right. well. it was
very nice to meet you all.

616
00:24:57.122 --> 00:24:58.957
- Oh. yeah.
- Oh. yeah.

617
00:24:58.957 --> 00:24:59.750
Yes.

618
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.667
Live long and prosper.

619
00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:02.920
Don't. don't. don't do that.

620
00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.546
It's "Star Trek."

621
00:25:04.546 --> 00:25:05.297
Bye.

622
00:25:22.231 --> 00:25:24.024
So what do your parents do?

623
00:25:24.024 --> 00:25:27.361
Oh. um. I actually
live with my grandma.

624
00:25:28.654 --> 00:25:30.364
Oh. no. no. no. I
don't think she's home.

625
00:25:30.364 --> 00:25:33.867
She. uh. she's a
volunteer brain surgeon.

626
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:35.619
Cool grandma.

627
00:25:35.619 --> 00:25:37.579
Yeah. so it's this way.

628
00:25:42.918 --> 00:25:43.919
Shall we?

629
00:25:45.379 --> 00:25:47.464
Right. the notes. yeah.

630
00:25:49.174 --> 00:25:49.925
Totally.

631
00:25:57.182 --> 00:25:58.433
What's wrong?

632
00:25:58.433 --> 00:26:01.937
Nothing. I'm just
trying to remember them.

633
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:04.565
Okay. uh...

634
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:16.827
Interesting.

635
00:26:20.163 --> 00:26:22.541
This does feel otherworldly.

636
00:26:29.006 --> 00:26:30.924
Did you take that photo?

637
00:26:30.924 --> 00:26:35.762
Oh. yeah. that's from the
night my parents disappeared.

638
00:26:35.762 --> 00:26:36.513
What?

639
00:26:38.515 --> 00:26:39.683
What happened?

640
00:26:40.642 --> 00:26:43.228
It's a long story.

641
00:26:43.228 --> 00:26:47.274
You don't have to tell
me if you don't want to.

642
00:26:48.442 --> 00:26:49.359
I don't know.

643
00:26:49.359 --> 00:26:50.819
I just feel like if I do.

644
00:26:50.819 --> 00:26:53.322
you won't want to hang
out with me anymore.

645
00:26:53.322 --> 00:26:54.907
That's not true.

646
00:26:56.617 --> 00:26:57.784
I'm listening.

647
00:27:00.704 --> 00:27:05.667
Okay. well. October
21st. 2012 at 9:44 p.m..

648
00:27:08.045 --> 00:27:09.463
Jesper's Comet made
its 10-year journey

649
00:27:09.463 --> 00:27:11.131
back into Earth's orbit.

650
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:13.467
So my dad and I
set up our homemade

651
00:27:13.467 --> 00:27:15.636
camera telescope
to photograph it

652
00:27:15.636 --> 00:27:18.889
and my parents were
never able to see it.

653
00:27:19.932 --> 00:27:20.933
Where did they go?

654
00:27:20.933 --> 00:27:23.268
They didn't go anywhere.

655
00:27:23.268 --> 00:27:24.978
They were taken.

656
00:27:24.978 --> 00:27:26.271
Taken?

657
00:27:26.271 --> 00:27:27.814
Taken by who?

658
00:27:36.615 --> 00:27:37.533
Aliens?

659
00:27:37.533 --> 00:27:38.784
UFO spottings happen all along

660
00:27:38.784 --> 00:27:39.910
Jesper's Comet's flight path.

661
00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:41.954
See. it's all here.

662
00:27:41.954 --> 00:27:43.997
And it's coming
back. Jesper's Comet.

663
00:27:43.997 --> 00:27:46.041
It'll make its 10-year
appearance again in 41 days.

664
00:27:46.041 --> 00:27:50.879
And if I'm right. which I
am. they're coming back. too.

665
00:27:50.879 --> 00:27:53.632
My parents are
coming back for me.

666
00:27:55.008 --> 00:27:56.301
Calvin. this is-

667
00:27:56.301 --> 00:27:57.594
Please. don't say
crazy. because it is all-

668
00:27:57.594 --> 00:27:59.429
Incredible!

669
00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:01.723
Calvin. this is incredible.

670
00:28:06.395 --> 00:28:07.145
Really?

671
00:28:08.897 --> 00:28:09.648
Yeah.

672
00:28:11.775 --> 00:28:14.111
Can you tell me more about it?

673
00:28:17.656 --> 00:28:18.740
Yeah. yeah.

674
00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:24.162
And then he's telling me
he's tracking this comet

675
00:28:24.162 --> 00:28:26.331
because he thinks that the
aliens that abducted his parents

676
00:28:26.331 --> 00:28:28.876
are following it. and I'm
like. "Why?" and he's like.

677
00:28:28.876 --> 00:28:31.086
"Because so when it comes
back. I'm gonna go with them."

678
00:28:33.714 --> 00:28:35.799
Wow. this is fantastic.

679
00:28:37.426 --> 00:28:38.677
Really?

680
00:28:38.677 --> 00:28:40.679
Yeah. I mean.
it's no Nobel Prize.

681
00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:43.015
but I can see the title now:

682
00:28:43.015 --> 00:28:45.309
"Delusional Pebble Falls
High Schooler Thinks Parents

683
00:28:45.309 --> 00:28:49.021
"Were Abducted by Aliens and
He's Finna Get Abducted Too."

684
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:50.939
Well. I don't think
he's delusional.

685
00:28:50.939 --> 00:28:52.566
I think he's more.
kind of like a sad.

686
00:28:52.566 --> 00:28:54.860
like. pathetic little
puppy. you know?

687
00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:55.986
Right. sad and pathetic.

688
00:28:55.986 --> 00:28:56.904
I love that.

689
00:28:56.904 --> 00:28:57.946
No. I didn't say that.

690
00:28:57.946 --> 00:29:00.032
I just mean he's like.
I don't know. he's-

691
00:29:00.032 --> 00:29:01.074
Crazy?

692
00:29:01.074 --> 00:29:03.035
No. I mean. yeah but.

693
00:29:03.952 --> 00:29:06.705
that one sounds a
little bit insensitive.

694
00:29:06.705 --> 00:29:08.123
You may be right.

695
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.251
There's an emotional
heart to this story

696
00:29:11.251 --> 00:29:12.878
that I think we're overlooking

697
00:29:12.878 --> 00:29:14.671
because we're getting too
wrapped up in the whole

698
00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:17.049
spectacle of the alien
abduction. you know?

699
00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:19.718
This is a story of a boy
looking for his parents.

700
00:29:19.718 --> 00:29:21.803
And they just so happen
to be abducted by aliens.

701
00:29:21.803 --> 00:29:23.096
That's the hook.

702
00:29:23.096 --> 00:29:24.264
But the heart of the
story is the fact

703
00:29:24.264 --> 00:29:25.849
that he's trying to find them.

704
00:29:25.849 --> 00:29:27.935
Like if he finds
them. he's completed.

705
00:29:27.935 --> 00:29:29.269
he's great. he's amazing.

706
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:33.315
If not. well. like who
even is he. you know?

707
00:29:33.315 --> 00:29:34.107
Itsy?

708
00:29:34.107 --> 00:29:36.235
Hello?

709
00:29:36.235 --> 00:29:36.985
Yeah.

710
00:29:38.862 --> 00:29:39.613
Okay.

711
00:29:40.781 --> 00:29:42.157
So you keep on hanging
out with Calvin

712
00:29:42.157 --> 00:29:45.035
and I want as much
information as possible. okay?

713
00:29:45.035 --> 00:29:48.038
I'm talking photos.
documentation. everything.

714
00:29:48.038 --> 00:29:50.249
And then I'll write it
into a readable format.

715
00:29:50.249 --> 00:29:53.001
and we will be in
NYC in no time.

716
00:29:53.001 --> 00:29:54.795
Well. can I see what
you've written so far?

717
00:29:57.381 --> 00:30:00.092
This is a team
effort. remember?

718
00:30:00.092 --> 00:30:01.844
So I'll handle all the writing.

719
00:30:01.844 --> 00:30:04.221
and you focus on our
weird little friend. okay?

720
00:30:04.221 --> 00:30:05.055
Sound good?

721
00:30:05.055 --> 00:30:06.890
Sounds good.

722
00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:07.891
Good.

723
00:30:09.142 --> 00:30:13.522
Um. well I have to get to
horseback riding lessons. so...

724
00:30:13.522 --> 00:30:14.314
That's cool.

725
00:30:14.314 --> 00:30:16.024
Yeah. okay.

726
00:30:16.024 --> 00:30:16.942
Oh. I leave; okay.

727
00:30:16.942 --> 00:30:18.861
Yeah. that's great.

728
00:30:24.908 --> 00:30:27.077
You're cleared to enter.

729
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.580
Hey. cutie bug.

730
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:32.207
What's all this for?

731
00:30:32.207 --> 00:30:33.876
These are photos for a
article that me and Calvin

732
00:30:33.876 --> 00:30:35.961
are working on for
a summer program

733
00:30:35.961 --> 00:30:38.589
at NYU's School of Journalism.

734
00:30:38.589 --> 00:30:40.048
Wow. what's the article on?

735
00:30:40.048 --> 00:30:42.301
We're leaning towards aliens.

736
00:30:42.301 --> 00:30:44.761
You mean like. SETI. right?

737
00:30:44.761 --> 00:30:45.846
What's SETI?

738
00:30:45.846 --> 00:30:48.015
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

739
00:30:48.015 --> 00:30:49.850
Well.
that sounds amazing-

740
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.852
Don't drink that.

741
00:30:51.852 --> 00:30:53.228
Actually. go ahead.

742
00:30:53.228 --> 00:30:55.647
By the way. your
mom and I are gonna be

743
00:30:55.647 --> 00:30:59.193
flying into the city to
tie up some loose ends-

744
00:30:59.193 --> 00:31:00.861
Whoo.

745
00:31:00.861 --> 00:31:02.988
So we'd like for you to
take care of each other

746
00:31:02.988 --> 00:31:04.281
for the next few days.

747
00:31:04.281 --> 00:31:05.782
You know. take Evan
to school and whatnot.

748
00:31:05.782 --> 00:31:07.159
Can I go?

749
00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:08.952
Please. you guys know that
I've been dying to go back!

750
00:31:08.952 --> 00:31:10.037
You guys have school-

751
00:31:10.037 --> 00:31:11.246
Yeah.

752
00:31:11.246 --> 00:31:14.374
And it's more of a
romantic weekend getaway. so.

753
00:31:14.374 --> 00:31:16.001
no kids allowed.

754
00:31:18.337 --> 00:31:19.963
So dinner's in 15.

755
00:31:19.963 --> 00:31:21.131
Don't worry. sis.

756
00:31:21.131 --> 00:31:22.883
I'll stay out of your way.

757
00:31:22.883 --> 00:31:24.301
Probably.

758
00:31:26.178 --> 00:31:29.056
Can you at least
close the door?

759
00:31:29.056 --> 00:31:29.806
Evan!

760
00:31:31.433 --> 00:31:32.684
So when's the next
time Jesper's Comet

761
00:31:32.684 --> 00:31:34.019
is supposed to come back?

762
00:31:34.019 --> 00:31:36.480
Approximately 38 days.
seven hours. and 32 minutes.

763
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.065
And then what happens
when it comes back?

764
00:31:38.065 --> 00:31:40.192
Well. I will be there
to greet them. duh.

765
00:31:40.192 --> 00:31:42.861
But have you ever
seen the aliens before?

766
00:31:42.861 --> 00:31:45.364
Well. I have seen
evidence of them.

767
00:31:45.364 --> 00:31:46.990
But not them-them.

768
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:48.033
More or less.

769
00:31:48.033 --> 00:31:49.034
Philips head?

770
00:31:50.452 --> 00:31:51.662
More-more. or more-less?

771
00:31:51.662 --> 00:31:52.996
Um. more-more.

772
00:31:53.997 --> 00:31:55.499
How do you even know
that this is safe.

773
00:31:55.499 --> 00:31:57.918
trying to contact
aliens and such?

774
00:31:57.918 --> 00:31:59.002
It totally is.

775
00:32:01.046 --> 00:32:01.922
Probably.

776
00:32:09.179 --> 00:32:10.764
We'll see.

777
00:32:10.764 --> 00:32:11.598
Not safe.

778
00:32:13.392 --> 00:32:14.893
Now it's safe.

779
00:32:14.893 --> 00:32:16.520
Wow do you even know
they're still out there?

780
00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.897
Well. when was the last time
you saw your grandparents?

781
00:32:18.897 --> 00:32:20.065
I don't know.

782
00:32:20.065 --> 00:32:20.732
It's been a couple years.

783
00:32:20.732 --> 00:32:22.067
Why?

784
00:32:22.067 --> 00:32:23.110
Well. how do you know
they're still out there?

785
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:24.027
Okay. that's not
even the same thing.

786
00:32:24.027 --> 00:32:25.320
and I can call my grandparents

787
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.572
to make sure that
they're still there.

788
00:32:26.572 --> 00:32:27.948
Yeah. so can I.

789
00:32:27.948 --> 00:32:29.658
You can call aliens?

790
00:32:29.658 --> 00:32:30.450
When? Where?

791
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:31.243
With what? With who?

792
00:32:31.243 --> 00:32:32.035
Why? How?

793
00:32:32.035 --> 00:32:33.161
How often? How come?

794
00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:34.454
What took you so long?

795
00:32:34.454 --> 00:32:35.873
My legs haven't
fully developed yet.

796
00:32:35.873 --> 00:32:38.000
Also. I'm not a very
good bike rider.

797
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.252
So you were saying
you can contact aliens by-

798
00:32:40.252 --> 00:32:42.129
Wait. does this PB&J
have mustard on it?

799
00:32:42.129 --> 00:32:42.921
No.

800
00:32:42.921 --> 00:32:43.922
Dang it.

801
00:32:45.632 --> 00:32:47.301
Thank you.

802
00:32:49.094 --> 00:32:50.679
What's going on?

803
00:32:50.679 --> 00:32:52.181
Intercepting a signal.

804
00:32:52.181 --> 00:32:53.849
Holy cow. this is happening!

805
00:32:53.849 --> 00:32:54.892
How do you know
when it's gonna-

806
00:32:54.892 --> 00:32:55.684
Shhh.

807
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.944
Subway drive through.
what can I get for you?

808
00:33:05.944 --> 00:33:08.822
Hey. so we just
ordered some sandwiches

809
00:33:08.822 --> 00:33:10.824
but the PB&Js didn't come
with mustard on them.

810
00:33:10.824 --> 00:33:12.201
Hi. Calvin.

811
00:33:12.201 --> 00:33:13.994
If you wanna swing by. we'll
make another sandwich for you.

812
00:33:13.994 --> 00:33:15.037
Awesome.

813
00:33:15.037 --> 00:33:15.829
Thank you. Heidi.

814
00:33:15.829 --> 00:33:17.372
I will see you soon.

815
00:33:18.498 --> 00:33:19.291
Yeah.

816
00:33:19.291 --> 00:33:20.209
Where's the bathroom?

817
00:33:20.209 --> 00:33:21.335
Uh. second bush on your right.

818
00:33:21.335 --> 00:33:22.085
Okay.

819
00:33:22.961 --> 00:33:24.880
And you. follow me.

820
00:33:26.757 --> 00:33:28.008
You could have called them.

821
00:33:28.008 --> 00:33:30.802
Okay. but that
was so much cooler.

822
00:33:33.222 --> 00:33:34.515
So what's that?

823
00:33:34.515 --> 00:33:37.476
It measures Earth's
electromagnetic fields.

824
00:33:37.476 --> 00:33:39.353
And then what's that button?

825
00:33:39.353 --> 00:33:44.191
Broadcasts a warning to all
networks in a 50-mile radius.

826
00:33:47.486 --> 00:33:48.403
What's that?

827
00:33:48.403 --> 00:33:49.613
That is an alarm signifying

828
00:33:49.613 --> 00:33:50.906
that something has
entered our atmosphere.

829
00:33:50.906 --> 00:33:51.865
and we've got less
than 30 seconds

830
00:33:51.865 --> 00:33:52.783
to launch a counterattack.

831
00:33:52.783 --> 00:33:53.534
Are you serious right now?

832
00:33:53.534 --> 00:33:54.451
Are we about to die?

833
00:33:54.451 --> 00:33:55.035
Why aren't you taking notes?

834
00:33:55.035 --> 00:33:55.994
I don't know.

835
00:33:55.994 --> 00:33:56.954
What am I supposed to write?

836
00:33:56.954 --> 00:33:58.455
November 11th at 4:13 p.m.

837
00:33:58.455 --> 00:34:00.082
Calvin proves he is the
smartest. coolest person

838
00:34:00.082 --> 00:34:01.250
that Itsy knows.

839
00:34:04.086 --> 00:34:05.838
I'm gonna kill you.

840
00:34:05.838 --> 00:34:06.922
That was evil.

841
00:34:06.922 --> 00:34:08.590
"OMG. are we gonna.
like. die right now?"

842
00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:09.466
That's not what I said.

843
00:34:09.466 --> 00:34:10.342
Hey. what's the-

844
00:34:10.342 --> 00:34:12.010
You're not funny.

845
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:13.512
Hey Calvin. I didn't know
which one was the pee bush.

846
00:34:13.512 --> 00:34:16.473
so I peed a little
on all of them...

847
00:34:17.975 --> 00:34:19.852
What's going on here?

848
00:34:19.852 --> 00:34:22.020
- Nothing.
- Nothing. what?

849
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:22.980
Nothing.

850
00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.314
- What?
- Nothing.

851
00:34:26.817 --> 00:34:28.777
So. who wants to
talk to some aliens?

852
00:34:28.777 --> 00:34:30.028
Yes. When?

853
00:34:30.028 --> 00:34:30.988
Right now.

854
00:34:34.241 --> 00:34:35.617
Anything?

855
00:34:35.617 --> 00:34:36.952
Nope.

856
00:34:36.952 --> 00:34:37.911
Don't probe me!

857
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:38.829
I'm sensitive!

858
00:34:41.498 --> 00:34:42.833
Hello?

859
00:34:43.876 --> 00:34:44.960
Hello. is anybody there?

860
00:34:45.878 --> 00:34:47.004
This is Calvin Kipler speaking.

861
00:34:47.004 --> 00:34:47.754
Hello.

862
00:34:49.756 --> 00:34:51.008
Dang it.

863
00:34:51.008 --> 00:34:51.925
What?

864
00:34:51.925 --> 00:34:53.719
We just missed it.

865
00:34:57.472 --> 00:34:58.265
Going to the bathroom.

866
00:34:58.265 --> 00:34:59.057
I'll be right back.

867
00:34:59.057 --> 00:34:59.850
Oh. no. no. no.

868
00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.226
You can't go in there.

869
00:35:01.226 --> 00:35:02.394
Calvin. I'm not
gonna pee in a bush.

870
00:35:02.394 --> 00:35:03.312
Just let me go inside.

871
00:35:03.312 --> 00:35:05.606
But. my grandma's sleeping.

872
00:35:05.606 --> 00:35:06.356
Naked.

873
00:35:07.441 --> 00:35:08.859
And she sleepwalks.

874
00:35:11.904 --> 00:35:16.700
Your grandma doesn't actually
live with you. does she?

875
00:35:18.619 --> 00:35:19.369
No.

876
00:35:21.038 --> 00:35:22.831
Then where is she?

877
00:35:22.831 --> 00:35:24.333
Well. that depends on if
you believe in an afterlife

878
00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:26.210
and that sort of thing.

879
00:35:28.504 --> 00:35:29.254
Shoot.

880
00:35:30.964 --> 00:35:33.008
Calvin. I'm really sorry.

881
00:35:34.426 --> 00:35:36.011
When did she pass?

882
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.972
Couple years back.

883
00:35:38.972 --> 00:35:41.600
But she knew if we
didn't keep it a secret.

884
00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.477
that once she died they'd
put me in a foster home

885
00:35:43.477 --> 00:35:46.730
and then I couldn't keep
looking for my parents.

886
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.900
So. she taught me
how to pay the bills

887
00:35:51.318 --> 00:35:52.528
and take care of myself.

888
00:35:52.528 --> 00:35:56.031
and I have been doing
that ever since.

889
00:35:56.031 --> 00:35:57.491
You've been on your
own all these years?

890
00:35:57.491 --> 00:35:59.451
Yeah well. there's
nothin' new about that.

891
00:35:59.451 --> 00:36:02.037
So um. the bathroom
is in on the.

892
00:36:05.624 --> 00:36:06.792
on your right.

893
00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:15.342
Um. yeah. the bathroom.

894
00:36:17.094 --> 00:36:18.595
Yes.

895
00:36:18.595 --> 00:36:19.346
Wait!

896
00:36:20.389 --> 00:36:22.558
Look. make a wish.

897
00:36:22.558 --> 00:36:25.811
I didn't think
you'd do that. too.

898
00:36:25.811 --> 00:36:28.230
I thought you'd just say there's
no point in wishing on it.

899
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.815
Yeah. well. shooting
stars are basically

900
00:36:29.815 --> 00:36:32.442
just metallic particles with
gases like hydrogen and helium.

901
00:36:32.442 --> 00:36:36.530
but I've spent so much
time looking at the sky

902
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:39.950
I figure if one in a
million grant my wish.

903
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:42.077
I'm already halfway there.

904
00:36:42.077 --> 00:36:46.248
You know. my dad said the light
from each one of those stars

905
00:36:46.248 --> 00:36:47.958
took millions and-

906
00:36:47.958 --> 00:36:50.502
Millions of
years to get to us.

907
00:36:50.502 --> 00:36:53.797
I mean. just think of
what it was like here

908
00:36:53.797 --> 00:36:56.675
when that light
was first sent out.

909
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.887
You mean. like dinosaurs?

910
00:36:59.887 --> 00:37:03.974
Oh much. much before
dinosaurs. kiddo.

911
00:37:03.974 --> 00:37:08.103
Most likely just noxious
gas and raw elements.

912
00:37:08.103 --> 00:37:10.772
But it's possible that some
of that starlight was sent out

913
00:37:10.772 --> 00:37:14.610
when the earth was just
bits of stardust. too.

914
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:17.404
Back when the universe
was brand new. and cold.

915
00:37:17.404 --> 00:37:20.824
and just starting
to form itself.

916
00:37:20.824 --> 00:37:22.367
How awesome is that?

917
00:37:24.912 --> 00:37:29.875
And who knows. maybe there's
an alien dad and alien kid

918
00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:32.085
out there looking at us. too.

919
00:37:33.253 --> 00:37:34.213
You think?

920
00:37:35.964 --> 00:37:38.008
Only one way to find out.

921
00:37:39.927 --> 00:37:41.845
Hello out there!

922
00:37:41.845 --> 00:37:43.347
My name is Cyrus!

923
00:37:43.347 --> 00:37:45.891
And this is my
alien son. Calvin!

924
00:37:45.891 --> 00:37:47.809
Hello out there. aliens.

925
00:37:47.809 --> 00:37:49.061
Oh. you gotta be
louder than that.

926
00:37:49.061 --> 00:37:50.145
They can't hear that.

927
00:37:50.145 --> 00:37:52.022
Hello out there!

928
00:37:52.022 --> 00:37:54.399
Hello. can you hear us?

929
00:37:54.399 --> 00:37:57.903
Hello. nice to meet
you. alien buddies!

930
00:37:57.903 --> 00:38:00.906
Hello. aliens!

931
00:38:00.906 --> 00:38:01.698
Hello!

932
00:38:03.992 --> 00:38:05.410

This is a gold mine!

00:38:43.574 --> 00:38:44.366
I love it.

948
00:38:44.366 --> 00:38:45.909
This is perfect.

949
00:38:45.909 --> 00:38:46.910
I think this is finally
enough to finish our article.

950
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:47.703
Really?

951
00:38:47.703 --> 00:38:49.037
You think that's enough?

952
00:38:49.037 --> 00:38:51.707
Yeah. I mean. he
is a crazy person.

953
00:38:51.707 --> 00:38:54.877
Forget the UFOs. the peanut
butter and jelly and mustard.

954
00:38:54.877 --> 00:38:56.879
that is enough for the
kid to be an outcast.

955
00:38:56.879 --> 00:39:01.091
For his own sake. I
hope Jasper's Comet
does come to town.

956
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:02.176
It's Jesper.

957
00:39:03.886 --> 00:39:05.888
Okay. whatever.

958
00:39:05.888 --> 00:39:07.181
Still going to be
a great article.

959
00:39:07.181 --> 00:39:09.975
and NYU's going to love it.

960
00:39:09.975 --> 00:39:11.602
I just. I don't know.

961
00:39:11.602 --> 00:39:13.187
I feel like we need
a different title.

962
00:39:13.187 --> 00:39:14.855
You know. maybe like.

963
00:39:14.855 --> 00:39:18.984
"Aliens Aren't the Weirdest
Thing in Pebble Falls."

964
00:39:18.984 --> 00:39:20.861
Yeah. no. I...

965
00:39:20.861 --> 00:39:23.488
Or "Pebble-Brained
in Pebble Falls?"

966
00:39:23.488 --> 00:39:25.824
Oh. wait. no. no. no. I have it.

967
00:39:25.824 --> 00:39:29.494
"Bit Space Delusions.
Small-Town Dope."

968
00:39:29.494 --> 00:39:32.080
But he's not an idiot.

969
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:32.998
What?

970
00:39:32.998 --> 00:39:33.916
I said. he's not an idiot.

971
00:39:33.916 --> 00:39:36.043
He's actually
really. really smart.

972
00:39:36.043 --> 00:39:37.127
I mean. look at this stuff.

973
00:39:37.127 --> 00:39:39.880
Telescopes. radiation
detector. magnometers.

974
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.090
and he made all of
it from scratch.

975
00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:44.968
If anything. he's the smartest
person in this stupid town.

976
00:39:44.968 --> 00:39:47.012
And yeah. his story's a
little bit far-fetched.

977
00:39:47.012 --> 00:39:50.599
but he's fighting for something.
and he has goals. and...

978
00:39:51.475 --> 00:39:53.936
he has a good heart.

979
00:39:53.936 --> 00:39:56.772
I think I know what
our title should be.

980
00:39:56.772 --> 00:39:59.107
"City Girl Falls
for Village Idiot."

981
00:39:59.107 --> 00:40:00.484
I'm not
falling for him.

982
00:40:00.484 --> 00:40:01.276
Oh. really?

983
00:40:01.276 --> 00:40:02.903
Then do you believe him?

984
00:40:02.903 --> 00:40:05.364
Do you believe his parents
were abducted by aliens?

985
00:40:05.364 --> 00:40:06.823
No. of course not.

986
00:40:06.823 --> 00:40:08.909
Are you sure?

987
00:40:12.496 --> 00:40:14.373
I think I'm gonna go.

988
00:40:17.376 --> 00:40:19.962
Don't publish the article yet.

989
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:23.715
Talk to you later.

990
00:40:40.023 --> 00:40:41.441
Calvin?

991
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:42.150
Yeah?

992
00:40:43.485 --> 00:40:47.322
Um. you know. I was. I
was kinda just thinking.

993
00:40:50.033 --> 00:40:52.744
What if your parents
weren't abducted by aliens?

994
00:40:52.744 --> 00:40:55.497
Well. that is impossible
because I saw it.

995
00:40:55.497 --> 00:40:58.959
I get that. but it was
a really long time ago.

996
00:40:58.959 --> 00:41:01.545
And you were really young.
and kids have a hard time

997
00:41:01.545 --> 00:41:03.046
remembering traumatic
things like-

998
00:41:03.046 --> 00:41:06.341
Like their parents
being abducted by aliens?

999
00:41:06.341 --> 00:41:08.510
Like their parents
abandoning them.

1000
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.846
My parents didn't
abandon me. Itsy.

1001
00:41:10.846 --> 00:41:12.389
I can prove it.

1002
00:41:12.389 --> 00:41:14.474
'Kay. December 5th. 2016.

1003
00:41:16.059 --> 00:41:18.812
The star called Nimbus in
the constellation Andromeda

1004
00:41:18.812 --> 00:41:23.317
blinked the morse
code for P-N-C-A-K-S.

1005
00:41:23.317 --> 00:41:24.818
What am I missing here?

1006
00:41:24.818 --> 00:41:26.069
It's pancakes.

1007
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:28.113
Duh. I mean. my
dad made pancakes

1008
00:41:28.113 --> 00:41:29.990
the very morning he disappeared.

1009
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:31.241
It's obviously a
message from them

1010
00:41:31.241 --> 00:41:34.620
telling me that they're
still out there.

1011
00:41:35.954 --> 00:41:40.667
Calvin. I think you need
real evidence of a UFO.

1012
00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:45.589
Okay. well I do have.
like. photographic memory.

1013
00:41:47.132 --> 00:41:49.092
I have photographic memory.

1014
00:41:49.092 --> 00:41:49.885
It's very rare.

1015
00:41:49.885 --> 00:41:51.011
Self-diagnosed.

1016
00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:54.723
But I have plenty of
pictures of the comet

1017
00:41:54.723 --> 00:41:56.016
in here somewhere.

1018
00:42:08.028 --> 00:42:09.530
Are these them?

1019
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.156
Hmm?

1020
00:42:11.156 --> 00:42:13.867
Is this your parents?

1021
00:42:13.867 --> 00:42:15.160
Yeah. yeah. that is.

1022
00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.620
Now. where is it?

1023
00:42:25.003 --> 00:42:25.838
Ah. okay.

1024
00:42:25.838 --> 00:42:26.964
See. here it is.

1025
00:42:30.092 --> 00:42:32.052
Okay. but this is only
the 8-millimeter preview

1026
00:42:32.052 --> 00:42:34.304
of the original
35-millimeter film.

1027
00:42:34.304 --> 00:42:37.057
so it's like one sixth
the original scale.

1028
00:42:37.891 --> 00:42:38.934
One fourth.

1029
00:42:39.935 --> 00:42:41.979
For a genius. you are
so bad at fractions.

1030
00:42:41.979 --> 00:42:43.021
Okay.

1031
00:42:43.021 --> 00:42:44.147
See. okay. but it's there.

1032
00:42:44.147 --> 00:42:46.066
Right there.

1033
00:42:46.066 --> 00:42:47.693
Yeah. it's kinda hard to see.

1034
00:42:47.693 --> 00:42:49.528
Why don't you develop it?

1035
00:42:49.528 --> 00:42:51.196
I mean. there's an old
photo shop back in town.

1036
00:42:51.196 --> 00:42:53.866
but it closed down
a couple years ago.

1037
00:42:53.866 --> 00:42:58.078
I already know it's there.
so like. what's the point?

1038
00:43:00.998 --> 00:43:03.375
Why don't I just take this

1039
00:43:03.375 --> 00:43:07.880
and I'll put it in my next
batch of film to be developed.

1040
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.964
Yeah. sure.

1041
00:43:10.757 --> 00:43:13.844
Anyways. I was
thinking it's a good idea

1042
00:43:13.844 --> 00:43:15.971
to start applying to some
schools for the fall.

1043
00:43:15.971 --> 00:43:17.264
I'm not going to college.

1044
00:43:17.264 --> 00:43:18.891
What do you mean?

1045
00:43:18.891 --> 00:43:19.683
You'd probably get a really
good scholarship somewhere

1046
00:43:19.683 --> 00:43:20.976
like MIT or NYU.

1047
00:43:20.976 --> 00:43:22.019
I'm not going to college

1048
00:43:22.019 --> 00:43:23.312
because I don't plan on
being on this planet.

1049
00:43:23.312 --> 00:43:25.022
not because I don't
think I could get in.

1050
00:43:29.985 --> 00:43:32.946
You really think
they're still out there?

1051
00:43:32.946 --> 00:43:34.448
Yeah. I do.

1052
00:44:23.288 --> 00:44:24.331
Oh my gosh.

1053
00:44:26.041 --> 00:44:26.875
Calvin.

1054
00:44:34.716 --> 00:44:36.760
Since the
discovery of the solar system.

1055
00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:37.678
mankind has-

1056
00:44:37.678 --> 00:44:39.012
Hey. where are you going?

1057
00:44:39.012 --> 00:44:40.138
By the
endless possibilities-

1058
00:44:40.138 --> 00:44:41.974
Camping with Calvin.

1059
00:44:41.974 --> 00:44:43.934
Um. take the bus
to school. okay?

1060
00:44:43.934 --> 00:44:48.313
And here is the money that
Mom and Dad gave me for food.

1061
00:44:48.313 --> 00:44:50.649
Order whatever you
want for dinner.

1062
00:44:50.649 --> 00:44:52.818
Triple pepperoni pizza?

1063
00:44:52.818 --> 00:44:54.069
I don't care.

1064
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.820
Bye.

1065
00:44:55.821 --> 00:44:58.407
Camping in the winter?

1066
00:45:00.033 --> 00:45:03.245
Point
of experimentation.

1067
00:45:04.955 --> 00:45:05.956
Get in.

1068
00:45:06.832 --> 00:45:08.041
What?

1069
00:45:08.041 --> 00:45:10.335
Get in. we're
going on a road trip.

1070
00:45:10.335 --> 00:45:11.587
Road trip?

1071
00:45:11.587 --> 00:45:12.880
But I was about to
oxidize my moon boots.

1072
00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.965
Well. I recently
made a discovery

1073
00:45:14.965 --> 00:45:17.426
regarding our
top-secret project.

1074
00:45:17.426 --> 00:45:18.218
Really?

1075
00:45:18.218 --> 00:45:19.636
What is it?

1076
00:45:19.636 --> 00:45:20.971
Well. obviously. I can't say.

1077
00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:23.515
Somebody could be listening.

1078
00:45:25.017 --> 00:45:26.310
Time is of the essence.

1079
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:27.853
and we need to be in Billings.
Montana by this weekend.

1080
00:45:27.853 --> 00:45:29.104
Wait. but the
orbit isn't happ-

1081
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:35.986
Your discovery needs to be
discovered this weekend?

1082
00:45:35.986 --> 00:45:36.987
Yes. but it's fine.

1083
00:45:36.987 --> 00:45:38.906
We'll be back in
time for the comet.

1084
00:45:38.906 --> 00:45:41.575
So are you in or not?

1085
00:45:41.575 --> 00:45:44.286
I'm gonna go
grab my space suit.

1086
00:45:56.673 --> 00:45:58.008
Any music requests?

1087
00:45:58.008 --> 00:46:00.511
Oh. Super Space Talk
Radio with Hank Fujiwara.

1088
00:46:00.511 --> 00:46:01.512
episode 429.

1089
00:46:02.804 --> 00:46:04.139
Why 429?

1090
00:46:04.139 --> 00:46:05.849
'Cause I love that one.

1091
00:46:05.849 --> 00:46:06.892
So good.

1092
00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.353
I'm Hank Fujiwara.

1093
00:46:09.353 --> 00:46:11.063
You may remember me
from my other podcast.

1094
00:46:11.063 --> 00:46:13.065
"Inner Space with
Hank Fujiwara."

1095
00:46:13.065 --> 00:46:14.316
Today's episode-

1096
00:46:14.316 --> 00:46:15.108
it's a real doozy.

1097
00:46:15.108 --> 00:46:16.693
What was that?

1098
00:46:16.693 --> 00:46:17.986
It's probably just something
tipping over in the back.

1099
00:46:17.986 --> 00:46:18.570
Ever heard
about space-time?

1100
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:19.488
Not space time-

1101
00:46:19.488 --> 00:46:20.405
Ooh. but I love this part.

1102
00:46:20.405 --> 00:46:21.907
See. Hank's theory is that time

1103
00:46:21.907 --> 00:46:23.283
functions differently in space.

1104
00:46:23.283 --> 00:46:25.035
And he's got this crazy
idea where if you were to

1105
00:46:25.035 --> 00:46:28.080
go into space with the.
like. space continuum.

1106
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.957
it kind of builds up.

1107
00:46:29.957 --> 00:46:33.585
It's interesting
.

1108
00:46:33.585 --> 00:46:34.837
You've seen "Toy Story"

1109
00:46:34.837 --> 00:46:36.046
which I'm sure
that you all have.

1110
00:46:36.046 --> 00:46:38.423
Oh. I brought some snacks.

1111
00:46:41.426 --> 00:46:42.845
Oreos and-

1112
00:46:42.845 --> 00:46:44.721
Orange juice.

1113
00:46:44.721 --> 00:46:45.556
You're joking.

1114
00:46:45.556 --> 00:46:46.849
Just try one.

1115
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:48.934
This is gonna
ruin Oreos for me.

1116
00:46:48.934 --> 00:46:49.852
Uh uh.

1117
00:46:49.852 --> 00:46:51.478
It's gonna blow your mind.

1118
00:46:58.610 --> 00:46:59.903
Now. in space-

1119
00:46:59.903 --> 00:47:00.654
Well?

1120
00:47:01.989 --> 00:47:03.031
Mm hm!

1121
00:47:03.031 --> 00:47:04.074
Yes!

1122
00:47:04.074 --> 00:47:04.825
Whoa!

1123
00:47:05.742 --> 00:47:06.493
The problem is that-

1124
00:47:06.493 --> 00:47:07.244
They're good. right?

1125
00:47:08.412 --> 00:47:10.080
There it was again.

1126
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.248
Is there anything?

1127
00:47:11.248 --> 00:47:12.833
No. nothing.

1128
00:47:12.833 --> 00:47:15.460
Slinky Dog's caboose.
and hits you all at once.

1129
00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.964
If there's some
sort (fades out).

1130
00:47:18.964 --> 00:47:23.260
Unable to move faster than
.

1131
00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:24.928
Geez. hungry much?

1132
00:47:24.928 --> 00:47:25.846
Yeah. a little.

1133
00:47:25.846 --> 00:47:28.265
Yeah. you wanna hand 'em over?

1134
00:47:28.265 --> 00:47:30.225
I just gave them to you.

1135
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:37.024
I'm gonna strangle
you. you idiot!

1136
00:47:37.024 --> 00:47:37.941
Don't kill me!

1137
00:47:37.941 --> 00:47:39.902
Calvin save me!

1138
00:47:39.902 --> 00:47:41.904
Taking him back would
be a 6-hour round trip.

1139
00:47:41.904 --> 00:47:43.697
We could put him on a bus.

1140
00:47:43.697 --> 00:47:44.948
He'd probably just
get off at the next stop

1141
00:47:44.948 --> 00:47:46.575
and get on one
headed our direction.

1142
00:47:46.575 --> 00:47:47.868
How?

1143
00:47:47.868 --> 00:47:48.619
He doesn't even know
where we're going.

1144
00:47:48.619 --> 00:47:49.369
Billings. Montana.

1145
00:47:49.369 --> 00:47:50.704
Shut up. Evan.

1146
00:47:50.704 --> 00:47:52.039
See. I think we
gotta take him with us.

1147
00:47:52.039 --> 00:47:53.373
No.

1148
00:47:53.373 --> 00:47:54.666
What do you wanna do?

1149
00:47:54.666 --> 00:47:56.043
Leave him tied up on
the side of the road?

1150
00:47:56.043 --> 00:47:57.461
We'll leave him with water.

1151
00:47:57.461 --> 00:47:58.921
Mom and Dad said you were
supposed to take care of me

1152
00:47:58.921 --> 00:48:00.214
while they were gone.

1153
00:48:00.214 --> 00:48:02.925
Unless you want me to tell
them you left me at home alone.

1154
00:48:02.925 --> 00:48:05.594
Poor little old Evan.

1155
00:48:05.594 --> 00:48:08.055
Fine. under one condition.

1156
00:48:08.055 --> 00:48:10.807
You obey all orders.
you do everything I ask.

1157
00:48:10.807 --> 00:48:14.770
and you don't annoy me
or else I'm ditching you.

1158
00:48:15.854 --> 00:48:16.939
That's like three conditions-

1159
00:48:16.939 --> 00:48:17.981
Evan!

1160
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:19.691
Okay. deal.

1161
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:21.193
All right. well. we should
probably hit the road.

1162
00:48:21.193 --> 00:48:22.486
Ooh. can I have shotgun?

1163
00:48:22.486 --> 00:48:23.862
No!

1164
00:48:27.783 --> 00:48:30.285
Ooh. should we
put some tunes on?

1165
00:48:31.912 --> 00:48:33.622
Are these salt
and vinegar chips?

1166
00:48:33.622 --> 00:48:34.998
They look del...

1167
00:48:37.501 --> 00:48:38.252
Fine.

1168
00:48:45.759 --> 00:48:47.010
I farted.

1169
00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:47.803
Oh!

1170
00:48:47.803 --> 00:48:48.887
Oh. that one's bad.

1171
00:48:48.887 --> 00:48:49.930
Oh. that's bad.

1172
00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.431
Geez. Evan.

1173
00:48:51.431 --> 00:48:52.558
Oh. oh!

1174
00:48:52.558 --> 00:48:54.643
You were asking for it.

1175
00:48:55.602 --> 00:48:57.855
Geez. my eyes can smell it.

1176
00:49:00.023 --> 00:49:01.900
Still no service.

1177
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.068
Okay. well. there
should be a map

1178
00:49:03.068 --> 00:49:04.778
in the glove compartment.

1179
00:49:19.877 --> 00:49:21.336
I don't know how to use this.

1180
00:49:21.336 --> 00:49:23.088
Of course you don't.

1181
00:49:23.088 --> 00:49:26.049
You have it upside
down. by the way.

1182
00:49:27.843 --> 00:49:28.844
Okay.

1183
00:49:30.137 --> 00:49:31.680
This is where you
almost left me for dead

1184
00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.682
on the side of the highway.

1185
00:49:33.682 --> 00:49:36.768
This is where we saw
that dead possum.

1186
00:49:36.768 --> 00:49:41.064
This about where we
should be. right there.

1187
00:49:41.064 --> 00:49:42.900
learn it.

1188
00:49:43.901 --> 00:49:46.069
Fine. you can be in
charge of the map then.

1189
00:49:47.654 --> 00:49:49.740
Ah. much better.

1190
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.033

Awesome. thanks. Itsy.

1202
00:50:34.826 --> 00:50:37.538
'Kay. who wants to
tell a campfire story?

1203
00:50:37.538 --> 00:50:38.914
I'll start.

1204
00:50:38.914 --> 00:50:42.960
This is the story of Daniel
and the hungry beaver.

1205
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:46.630
So Daniel was out fishing.
and he saw a beaver.

1206
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:48.048
He took it home-

1207
00:50:48.048 --> 00:50:50.008
I think I'm gonna
grab some firewood.

1208
00:50:50.008 --> 00:50:51.301
Okay.

1209
00:50:51.301 --> 00:50:53.679
He was out fishing
and he found a beaver

1210
00:50:53.679 --> 00:50:55.681
who was always hungry.

1211
00:50:55.681 --> 00:50:56.932
He took him home and-

1212
00:50:56.932 --> 00:50:59.560
I think I'm
gonna go help Itsy.

1213
00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.561
Okay.

1214
00:51:00.561 --> 00:51:02.479
I'll just stay by the fire.

1215
00:51:02.479 --> 00:51:03.772
Guarding it.

1216
00:51:03.772 --> 00:51:04.648
From water.

1217
00:51:07.442 --> 00:51:09.987
Guess I'll just continue
the story by myself.

1218
00:51:12.239 --> 00:51:14.825
Hey.

1219
00:51:14.825 --> 00:51:16.285
Um. are you having fun?

1220
00:51:16.285 --> 00:51:18.662
Oh. yeah. I love
collecting wood.

1221
00:51:18.662 --> 00:51:21.874
No. I mean on this
trip in general.

1222
00:51:21.874 --> 00:51:24.376
Oh. of course. um...

1223
00:51:24.376 --> 00:51:25.335
Are you?

1224
00:51:25.335 --> 00:51:27.880
Yeah. I'm having a lot of fun.

1225
00:51:29.965 --> 00:51:31.091
Um. hey. Itsy.

1226
00:51:32.384 --> 00:51:34.553
There was something I
wanted to say to you.

1227
00:51:34.553 --> 00:51:35.929
and I'm sure you
can already tell.

1228
00:51:35.929 --> 00:51:39.975
But I'm not really somebody
that has a lot of friends.

1229
00:51:39.975 --> 00:51:42.060
People kinda think I'm weird.

1230
00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:42.936
You're not weird.

1231
00:51:42.936 --> 00:51:43.770
No. I am.

1232
00:51:45.147 --> 00:51:47.983
But I like that part
of me. you know?

1233
00:51:47.983 --> 00:51:50.903
Just makes it difficult for
other people to really like me.

1234
00:51:50.903 --> 00:51:53.280
I found it really
easy to like you.

1235
00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:53.989
Really?

1236
00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:57.409
Yeah.

1237
00:51:58.702 --> 00:52:00.412
I find it really easy.

1238
00:52:01.872 --> 00:52:03.999
To really like you.

1239
00:52:03.999 --> 00:52:05.000
I um...

1240
00:52:07.377 --> 00:52:09.004
I really like you. too.

1241
00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.011
I-I wanna ask you something.

1242
00:52:16.011 --> 00:52:17.054
What is it?

1243
00:52:17.054 --> 00:52:19.014
Well. I was wondering.

1244
00:52:20.933 --> 00:52:23.852
Itsy. may I have your consent?

1245
00:52:23.852 --> 00:52:25.062
My consent?

1246
00:52:25.062 --> 00:52:27.147
Yeah. to like. you know...

1247
00:52:27.147 --> 00:52:30.025
Geez. Calvin. I don't
think we're ready for that.

1248
00:52:30.025 --> 00:52:31.652
Right. I'm sorry.

1249
00:52:31.652 --> 00:52:34.238
Kissing's a huge step. and we
should really take that slow.

1250
00:52:34.238 --> 00:52:35.531
Hold on.

1251
00:52:35.531 --> 00:52:38.200
You were asking for my
consent just to kiss me?

1252
00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.535
Of course.

1253
00:52:39.535 --> 00:52:40.911
I mean. consent is
really important.

1254
00:52:40.911 --> 00:52:44.081
Well. in that case. of
course you can kiss me.

1255
00:52:44.081 --> 00:52:44.831
Really?

1256
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.292
Thank you.

1257
00:52:47.292 --> 00:52:48.502
Um. it's an honor.

1258
00:52:48.502 --> 00:52:49.920
I. um...

1259
00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:50.963
Okay.

1260
00:52:50.963 --> 00:52:51.964
Well. if I may.

1261
00:53:01.056 --> 00:53:03.267
How much frickin' firewood
are you guys getting?

1262
00:53:03.267 --> 00:53:05.435
Oh. oh. oops.

1263
00:53:05.435 --> 00:53:07.354
Oh. is that firewood?

1264
00:53:07.354 --> 00:53:09.731
I think I'll go investigate.

1265
00:53:11.358 --> 00:53:12.985
Um. anyways.

1266
00:53:14.528 --> 00:53:15.946
Hey. my foot is stuck.

1267
00:53:15.946 --> 00:53:17.656
I stepped in something squishy.

1268
00:53:17.656 --> 00:53:21.618
It might be dead. but it
is most certainly squishy.

1269
00:53:21.618 --> 00:53:22.828
He'll be fine.

1270
00:53:22.828 --> 00:53:23.871
Okay.

1271
00:53:23.871 --> 00:53:25.706
Ouch. that hurt!

1272
00:53:25.706 --> 00:53:26.748
Okay. it bit me!

1273
00:53:26.748 --> 00:53:28.625
I need to see a doctor.

1274
00:53:30.335 --> 00:53:32.087
Okay. well. we should
probably go help him.

1275
00:53:32.087 --> 00:53:32.838
Yeah.

1276
00:53:36.258 --> 00:53:38.719
I think
it's licking me.

1277
00:53:40.888 --> 00:53:42.639
Larry. the Hungry.

1278
00:53:42.639 --> 00:53:44.016
This kid
is always hungry.

1279
00:53:44.016 --> 00:53:45.893
I'm starving.

1280
00:53:45.893 --> 00:53:47.561
I could eat a cow. horse-

1281
00:53:47.561 --> 00:53:49.021
Or Oreos.

1282
00:53:49.021 --> 00:53:51.982
Guys. there's an
old tire someone left here.

1283
00:53:51.982 --> 00:53:53.192
When are we gonna get there?

1284
00:53:53.192 --> 00:53:54.943
There it is right there.

1285
00:53:54.943 --> 00:53:55.944
Yes!

1286
00:53:57.571 --> 00:54:00.282
You know. we've seen seven
deer on the side of the road.

1287
00:54:00.282 --> 00:54:01.325
Only seven?

1288
00:54:01.325 --> 00:54:02.868
We've been driving for so long.

1289
00:54:02.868 --> 00:54:03.619
I know.

1290
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:07.956
Hey. gotta keep
track of something.

1291
00:54:09.041 --> 00:54:10.918
They sell moose here?

1292
00:54:10.918 --> 00:54:12.461
Gross.

1293
00:54:12.461 --> 00:54:13.587
'Kay. so we're
having lunch here

1294
00:54:13.587 --> 00:54:15.839
and then are we almost there?

1295
00:54:15.839 --> 00:54:18.133
Actually. we're here.

1296
00:54:18.133 --> 00:54:19.593
This is the last place.

1297
00:54:19.593 --> 00:54:20.928
Welcome. guys.

1298
00:54:20.928 --> 00:54:23.639
Anything I can get
you started with?

1299
00:54:23.639 --> 00:54:24.389
Mom?

1300
00:54:28.101 --> 00:54:28.852
Calvin?

1301
00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:39.321
Hey.

1302
00:54:51.875 --> 00:54:53.961
So um. how's Cyrus doing?

1303
00:54:55.629 --> 00:54:56.797
You mean. Dad?

1304
00:54:56.797 --> 00:54:58.006
Oh. I'm sorry.

1305
00:54:58.006 --> 00:55:00.384
It's probably weird
for me to ask.

1306
00:55:00.384 --> 00:55:01.552
I was just curious.

1307
00:55:01.552 --> 00:55:03.887
You don't have to answer.

1308
00:55:03.887 --> 00:55:06.807
He knows that you're
here at least. right?

1309
00:55:06.807 --> 00:55:08.016
No. he doesn't because-

1310
00:55:08.016 --> 00:55:11.395
Oh. Calvin. he
must be worried sick!

1311
00:55:11.395 --> 00:55:12.604
No. he's not-

1312
00:55:12.604 --> 00:55:15.148
Hey. no. you need to call him.

1313
00:55:18.151 --> 00:55:18.902
I um

1314
00:55:20.362 --> 00:55:21.113
I can't.

1315
00:55:22.948 --> 00:55:25.450
Okay. why can't you?

1316
00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:27.911
'Cause I don't
know where he is.

1317
00:55:27.911 --> 00:55:32.708
I haven't seen him since that
night that you guys. um...

1318
00:55:34.543 --> 00:55:36.879
That. that. that night what?

1319
00:55:38.755 --> 00:55:42.426
Ms. Kipler. um. from
what Calvin's told me.

1320
00:55:42.426 --> 00:55:46.180
he believes that you and Cyrus
disappeared 10 years ago.

1321
00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.222
Disappeared?

1322
00:55:47.222 --> 00:55:48.307
What do you mean?

1323
00:55:48.307 --> 00:55:49.349
He thought.

1324
00:55:50.392 --> 00:55:51.435
he thinks...

1325
00:55:52.936 --> 00:55:53.687
What?

1326
00:55:55.939 --> 00:55:57.274
What does he think?

1327
00:55:57.274 --> 00:56:00.527
Someone please explain
to me what's going on.

1328
00:56:00.527 --> 00:56:01.445
No. wait.

1329
00:56:04.406 --> 00:56:05.949
You need to explain.

1330
00:56:08.869 --> 00:56:10.662
Where have you been?

1331
00:56:13.457 --> 00:56:14.291
Oh. geez.

1332
00:56:16.793 --> 00:56:20.172
Where haven't I
been?

1333
00:56:20.172 --> 00:56:21.882
I've been all over.

1334
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.635
But I. I saw it.

1335
00:56:25.844 --> 00:56:26.678
I saw it.

1336
00:56:26.678 --> 00:56:28.305
Saw what?

1337
00:56:28.305 --> 00:56:29.765
What did you see?

1338
00:56:31.683 --> 00:56:33.644
I thought both of
you both were abducted.

1339
00:56:33.644 --> 00:56:34.520
Abducted?

1340
00:56:35.854 --> 00:56:37.814
By aliens. or something?

1341
00:56:42.945 --> 00:56:43.946
No.

1342
00:56:45.948 --> 00:56:49.952
No. Calvin. that's not
at all what happened?

1343
00:56:49.952 --> 00:56:51.828
Your father and I
were separating.

1344
00:56:51.828 --> 00:56:52.829
We were.

1345
00:56:54.957 --> 00:56:56.250
we were getting a divorce.

1346
00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:59.878
He was supposed to explain
all of that to you.

1347
00:56:59.878 --> 00:57:02.506
Vera. Vera. slow down.

1348
00:57:02.506 --> 00:57:03.924
Come on.

1349
00:57:03.924 --> 00:57:04.925
Come inside and let's sit
down and talk about this.

1350
00:57:04.925 --> 00:57:06.009
No.

1351
00:57:06.009 --> 00:57:06.760
No. Cy.

1352
00:57:07.845 --> 00:57:08.887
If I don't do this now.

1353
00:57:08.887 --> 00:57:10.848
it'll just be another
thing that I never did.

1354
00:57:10.848 --> 00:57:13.475
and I can't. I can't do this.

1355
00:57:13.475 --> 00:57:15.936
I know we had so many plans.

1356
00:57:15.936 --> 00:57:19.022
And living in a broken-down
house in the middle of nowhere

1357
00:57:19.022 --> 00:57:20.023
was not one them.

1358
00:57:20.023 --> 00:57:23.235
Cy. I don't know
what happened to us.

1359
00:57:23.235 --> 00:57:25.863
We became a family. Vera.

1360
00:57:25.863 --> 00:57:27.906
That's what happened to us.

1361
00:57:29.366 --> 00:57:31.493
Vera. please.

1362
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:34.037
I'll let you go.

1363
00:57:34.037 --> 00:57:35.831
I promise I will.

1364
00:57:35.831 --> 00:57:38.917
At least say goodbye to him.

1365
00:57:38.917 --> 00:57:40.502
You know I can't do that.

1366
00:57:40.502 --> 00:57:41.253
Why?

1367
00:57:42.754 --> 00:57:46.967
Because if I do that
then I will never leave.

1368
00:57:46.967 --> 00:57:49.511
Well then maybe you shouldn't.

1369
00:57:50.846 --> 00:57:52.848
We can figure it out.

1370
00:57:52.848 --> 00:57:55.934
Just tell me what
to do. anything.

1371
00:57:55.934 --> 00:57:57.978
Just tell me what you need.

1372
00:57:59.813 --> 00:58:02.024
Tell Calvin I'm sorry.

1373
00:58:14.036 --> 00:58:15.579
Why did you leave?

1374
00:58:18.582 --> 00:58:21.043
Uh.

1375
00:58:21.043 --> 00:58:23.504
I don't know. Calvin.

1376
00:58:23.504 --> 00:58:24.254
I just...

1377
00:58:25.464 --> 00:58:26.215
No.

1378
00:58:28.675 --> 00:58:30.886
No. 'cause you need a reason.

1379
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:34.723
Did you need to go somewhere?

1380
00:58:34.723 --> 00:58:36.350
Did something happen?

1381
00:58:37.935 --> 00:58:40.896
Did I do something wrong?

1382
00:58:40.896 --> 00:58:41.688
Did I make you mad?

1383
00:58:41.688 --> 00:58:42.940
No. no. no!

1384
00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:44.191
You were good.

1385
00:58:44.191 --> 00:58:47.736
You did nothing
.

1386
00:58:47.736 --> 00:58:49.029
You did nothing wrong.

1387
00:58:49.029 --> 00:58:51.490
You're really

1388
00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:53.992
a great kid.

1389
00:58:53.992 --> 00:58:55.244
Great kid.

1390
00:58:55.244 --> 00:58:56.870
I think that I just.

1391
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:59.998
listen. I think that I
wasn't meant to be a mom.

1392
00:58:59.998 --> 00:59:02.334
At least not a very
good one. obviously.

1393
00:59:02.334 --> 00:59:04.670
No. no. no. 'cause
you were to me.

1394
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:05.420
You were.

1395
00:59:07.965 --> 00:59:09.341
You were my mom.

1396
00:59:13.637 --> 00:59:15.681
The truth is
that I left because

1397
00:59:15.681 --> 00:59:17.683
when your father and I
married. I was so young.

1398
00:59:17.683 --> 00:59:21.186
and I barely knew who I was.

1399
00:59:21.186 --> 00:59:25.357
And once I figured it out.
I was just so desperate

1400
00:59:27.359 --> 00:59:30.529
to get out of that little
town and see the world.

1401
00:59:30.529 --> 00:59:33.949
and it felt like
life was out there.

1402
00:59:33.949 --> 00:59:36.785
And I was so scared that
I was gonna miss it.

1403
00:59:36.785 --> 00:59:40.122
that I was going to
give up anything.

1404
00:59:40.122 --> 00:59:42.207
Give up anything. yeah.

1405
00:59:43.417 --> 00:59:44.459
You mean me.

1406
00:59:44.459 --> 00:59:45.252
No.

1407
00:59:45.252 --> 00:59:46.461
Don't say it like that.

1408
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:49.006
No. I wanted to come back.

1409
00:59:49.006 --> 00:59:52.551
But the thought of facing you

1410
00:59:54.094 --> 00:59:56.847
and your dad.

1411
00:59:56.847 --> 00:59:59.766
How could I after I left you?

1412
01:00:01.435 --> 01:00:04.980
So just easier to
let it go. you know.

1413
01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:08.400
like water under the bridge.

1414
01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.652
So you can understand
that. right?

1415
01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:11.653
Yeah. yeah.

1416
01:00:11.653 --> 01:00:12.404
Yeah.

1417
01:00:15.908 --> 01:00:17.576
It's easier just
to forget I exist.

1418
01:00:17.576 --> 01:00:18.368
I get it.

1419
01:00:18.368 --> 01:00:19.953
No.

1420
01:00:19.953 --> 01:00:21.955
Calvin. you're taking all
of this the wrong way.

1421
01:00:21.955 --> 01:00:25.417
I'm saying that all
of this is behind us.

1422
01:00:26.793 --> 01:00:28.003
We can be friends now.

1423
01:00:28.003 --> 01:00:31.006
I don't wanna
to be your friend.

1424
01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:34.468
I wanted to be your son.

1425
01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:40.933
So. let's go.

1426
01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:13.924
I'm Hank Fujiwara.

1427
01:01:13.924 --> 01:01:17.928
You may remember me
from my other podcast.

1428
01:01:33.902 --> 01:01:35.863
See you later. Calvin.

1429
01:01:36.989 --> 01:01:38.240
See you. buddy.

1430
01:01:46.123 --> 01:01:49.459
Well. thank you
for the road trip.

1431
01:01:49.459 --> 01:01:50.294
It was. um.

1432
01:01:53.005 --> 01:01:54.339
well. thank you.

1433
01:01:55.299 --> 01:01:56.800
Calvin. I'm sorry.

1434
01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.554
I didn't know what I
expected your mom to be like-

1435
01:02:00.554 --> 01:02:01.972
It's no big deal.

1436
01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:07.561
It's not like it was
your fault. or anything.

1437
01:02:07.561 --> 01:02:11.940
Well. actually. I've been
meaning to tell you that

1438
01:02:12.983 --> 01:02:13.859
me and Heather. we start-

1439
01:02:16.528 --> 01:02:18.530
Well. I gotta get going.

1440
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:19.823
See you at school tomorrow.

1441
01:02:21.283 --> 01:02:22.618
Good night.

1442
01:02:22.618 --> 01:02:24.244
We're back!

1443
01:02:25.579 --> 01:02:27.748
What's up. Cal?

1444
01:02:27.748 --> 01:02:29.249
It's so
good to see you!

1445
01:02:29.249 --> 01:02:31.376
You too.

1446
01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:33.003
Calvin was here?

1447
01:02:33.003 --> 01:02:33.921
Yeah.

1448
01:02:34.963 --> 01:02:36.757
You ready for bed?

1449
01:02:36.757 --> 01:02:39.593
No. I gotta
hear all the stories.

1450
01:02:39.593 --> 01:02:40.844
All the stories?

1451
01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:42.679
Yeah.
every single story.

1452
01:02:42.679 --> 01:02:44.389
and that thing about Daniel

1453
01:02:44.389 --> 01:02:48.143
and the hungry beaver
named Larry. part two.

1454
01:02:56.944 --> 01:02:57.903
There she is!

1455
01:02:59.947 --> 01:03:01.615
Heather. what's going on?

1456
01:03:01.615 --> 01:03:04.701
OMG. that's right. you
played hooky on Friday.

1457
01:03:04.701 --> 01:03:05.452
We won.

1458
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.623
New York City. here we come.

1459
01:03:09.623 --> 01:03:11.500
Heather. why would
you turn this in?

1460
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.376
'Cause that was the plan?

1461
01:03:12.376 --> 01:03:13.126
What?

1462
01:03:14.962 --> 01:03:15.963
Calvin.

1463
01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:20.968
Calvin. I'm sorry.

1464
01:03:20.968 --> 01:03:22.928
Calvin. I can
explain. I promise.

1465
01:03:22.928 --> 01:03:25.347
Calvin. can you wait?

1466
01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:26.890
Calvin. stop.

1467
01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:27.850
Calvin. wait. serious-

1468
01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:29.810
Was it before or after?

1469
01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:31.770
What do you mean?

1470
01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:35.107
Did you start writing that
paper before or after our trip?

1471
01:03:35.107 --> 01:03:36.441
Before-

1472
01:03:36.441 --> 01:03:37.359
Was it before or
after you told me

1473
01:03:37.359 --> 01:03:38.861
you wanted to be my friend?

1474
01:03:38.861 --> 01:03:40.237
Before.

1475
01:03:40.237 --> 01:03:43.615
Was it before or after
you told me you liked me?

1476
01:03:43.615 --> 01:03:44.366
Before.

1477
01:03:46.243 --> 01:03:48.036
So all of that

1478
01:03:48.036 --> 01:03:51.874
was just to get out of
this stupid town. right?

1479
01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:55.169
Calvin. I didn't know
you like I know you now.

1480
01:03:55.169 --> 01:03:56.461
Yeah well. my mom knew me too.

1481
01:03:56.461 --> 01:03:57.921
and that is exactly
what she did.

1482
01:03:57.921 --> 01:03:59.298
I wouldn't do that.

1483
01:03:59.298 --> 01:04:01.008
Oh hey. Calvin.
any word from E.T.

1484
01:04:01.008 --> 01:04:02.301
on how Mom and Dad are doing?

1485
01:04:02.301 --> 01:04:03.260
I heard probing was a thing.

1486
01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.803
That's not true.

1487
01:04:04.803 --> 01:04:05.721
Yes. it is.

1488
01:04:05.721 --> 01:04:06.722
I saw it on the SYFY channel.

1489
01:04:06.722 --> 01:04:08.015
No. his mom wasn't abducted.

1490
01:04:08.015 --> 01:04:10.309
We found her this
weekend in Montana.

1491
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:11.059
Oh.

1492
01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:15.022
So she just ran out?

1493
01:04:15.022 --> 01:04:15.939
No. I mean-

1494
01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:17.024
Well. you were right. Itsy.

1495
01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:18.358
Isn't that what you said?

1496
01:04:18.358 --> 01:04:21.778
You said that he was so
sad and pathetic. right?

1497
01:04:23.113 --> 01:04:25.699
Aww. look. he's so sad now.

1498
01:04:25.699 --> 01:04:26.909
Hey. maybe Mommy
will kiss it better

1499
01:04:26.909 --> 01:04:28.243
if she hasn't run off again.

1500
01:04:28.243 --> 01:04:29.328
What is wrong with you?

1501
01:04:29.328 --> 01:04:30.245
No!

1502
01:04:30.245 --> 01:04:30.913
You're such a jerk. Heather!

1503
01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:33.999
Get off me!

1504
01:04:33.999 --> 01:04:36.293
Fight.
fight. fight!

1505
01:04:36.293 --> 01:04:37.586
Come at me. you mongrels!

1506
01:04:37.586 --> 01:04:38.754
You're not ready!

1507
01:04:38.754 --> 01:04:40.005
I'm built different!

1508
01:04:42.674 --> 01:04:43.550
That's my sister!

1509
01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.468
Get off me!

1510
01:04:44.468 --> 01:04:45.761
Help me!

1511
01:04:45.761 --> 01:04:46.887
I've been waiting a
long time to do this!

1512
01:04:48.472 --> 01:04:50.349
So I take one out. give
the ol'

1513
01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:52.476
and then the other one
comes at me like aahh.

1514
01:04:52.476 --> 01:04:53.977
and then I'm like. so I'm
like "Today's my lucky day."

1515
01:04:55.479 --> 01:04:57.231
Okay. okay. we get it. honey.

1516
01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:58.482
I mean. we're just lucky

1517
01:04:58.482 --> 01:04:59.775
they didn't suspend
the both of you.

1518
01:04:59.775 --> 01:05:01.235
Yeah. speaking of which.

1519
01:05:01.235 --> 01:05:04.238
I was thinking we ground
you guys for like. 2 days.

1520
01:05:04.238 --> 01:05:06.573
Oh. our first grounding.

1521
01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:07.866
How fun.

1522
01:05:07.866 --> 01:05:10.452
We can make you guys
pull weeds. or something.

1523
01:05:10.452 --> 01:05:12.037
Sand the banisters?

1524
01:05:12.037 --> 01:05:14.206
I've got some ottomans that
need to be reupholstered.

1525
01:05:14.206 --> 01:05:15.207
You can do that. too.

1526
01:05:15.207 --> 01:05:16.792
Ooh. exciting.

1527
01:05:16.792 --> 01:05:19.419
I have no clue
what that means. whatsoever.

1528
01:05:25.926 --> 01:05:29.930
Hey. you remember that
you're grounded. right?

1529
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:31.682
Just be back before dinner.

1530
01:05:31.682 --> 01:05:32.933

What's wrong?

1542
01:06:42.377 --> 01:06:43.629
Dinner.

1543
01:06:43.629 --> 01:06:45.589
You can just leave it.

1544
01:06:47.674 --> 01:06:48.926
These from Calvin's shed?

1545
01:06:48.926 --> 01:06:51.136
Yeah. he was
tracking this comet.

1546
01:06:51.136 --> 01:06:53.013
the one he believed that the UFO

1547
01:06:53.013 --> 01:06:55.891
that took his parents
were following.

1548
01:06:55.891 --> 01:06:57.809
'Til I blew it all up.

1549
01:06:57.809 --> 01:06:59.561
That was pretty uncool of you.

1550
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:00.562
But he still deserved to know

1551
01:07:00.562 --> 01:07:02.731
that his mom was
still out there.

1552
01:07:02.731 --> 01:07:04.942
even if she was a total jerk.

1553
01:07:06.693 --> 01:07:07.903
What are these?

1554
01:07:07.903 --> 01:07:11.073
Those were taken the
night his parents left.

1555
01:07:11.073 --> 01:07:14.535
and he didn't have a way
to develop them. so I did.

1556
01:07:14.535 --> 01:07:16.245
What this. though?

1557
01:07:16.245 --> 01:07:17.538
I just told you.

1558
01:07:17.538 --> 01:07:20.123
No. this. right here.

1559
01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:21.124
Is that a UFO?

1560
01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:22.251
That's a UFO?

1561
01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:23.377
Shh!

1562
01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:26.213
It's tonight.

1563
01:07:26.213 --> 01:07:27.548
Huh?

1564
01:07:27.548 --> 01:07:28.757
That's why he's
not at the shed.

1565
01:07:28.757 --> 01:07:30.884
Jesper's Comet
flies over tonight!

1566
01:07:30.884 --> 01:07:33.011
How many times do I
have to say orienteering

1567
01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:34.972
before you listen to me?

1568
01:07:36.306 --> 01:07:39.893
With these coordinates
measuring for travel time.

1569
01:07:39.893 --> 01:07:43.063
huh. the comet path
should be right here.

1570
01:07:43.063 --> 01:07:46.233
but it looks like he mixed up
the 1/3 and 1/4 mile marker

1571
01:07:46.233 --> 01:07:49.111
and went to a spot
2 miles south.

1572
01:07:49.111 --> 01:07:51.113
You are a genius!

1573
01:07:51.113 --> 01:07:52.531
Freakin' fractions.

1574
01:07:52.531 --> 01:07:53.866
Oh. man.

1575
01:07:53.866 --> 01:07:56.034
Unless we tell him.
he's gonna miss the comet.

1576
01:07:56.034 --> 01:07:57.244
You forget. we're grounded.

1577
01:07:57.244 --> 01:07:59.997
You forget that
I'm very clever.

1578
01:08:01.874 --> 01:08:02.916
Hello. Mother and Father.

1579
01:08:02.916 --> 01:08:06.753
I'm just going to the
kitchen for sustenance.

1580
01:08:08.881 --> 01:08:09.882
Oh. no!

1581
01:08:09.882 --> 01:08:11.133
I've broken something.

1582
01:08:11.133 --> 01:08:13.760
Gasp! I think it's
Mother's favorite tea mug!

1583
01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.262
Better not be!

1584
01:08:15.262 --> 01:08:16.847
Never mind.

1585
01:08:16.847 --> 01:08:18.015
I think it's Dad's entire
shot glass collection

1586
01:08:18.015 --> 01:08:19.641
from Venezuela.

1587
01:08:19.641 --> 01:08:21.935
If you mean Nicaragua.
I'm gonna be really upset.

1588
01:08:33.947 --> 01:08:36.200
Hold it right there. missy.

1589
01:08:37.743 --> 01:08:39.536
I'm guessing your brother
orchestrated that whole thing

1590
01:08:39.536 --> 01:08:42.372
as a distraction so
you could sneak out?

1591
01:08:42.372 --> 01:08:43.707
Mm hm.

1592
01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:44.917
And you're going
to go find Calvin?

1593
01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:45.918
Mm hm.

1594
01:08:49.046 --> 01:08:51.924
Then you should
probably take my car.

1595
01:08:51.924 --> 01:08:54.259
Wait. you'll need this.

1596
01:08:54.259 --> 01:08:55.802
It's dark out there.

1597
01:08:56.803 --> 01:08:58.764
You guys are okay with this?

1598
01:08:58.764 --> 01:09:01.934
Ah. you can be
grounded some other time.

1599
01:09:01.934 --> 01:09:04.895
Maybe next Thursday.

1600
01:09:09.566 --> 01:09:10.859
Go get 'em. kiddo.

1601
01:09:10.859 --> 01:09:11.652
Love you guys.

1602
01:09:11.652 --> 01:09:12.528

Calvin.

1630
01:10:25.475 --> 01:10:27.978
Calvin. I am so sorry
about everything.

1631
01:10:27.978 --> 01:10:29.479
I shouldn't have written
that article about you.

1632
01:10:29.479 --> 01:10:30.772
and I shouldn't have
said those things.

1633
01:10:30.772 --> 01:10:32.065
and you were right
about everything

1634
01:10:32.065 --> 01:10:33.775
except your mom being abducted.
who just turned out to be

1635
01:10:33.775 --> 01:10:34.568
a total jerk-

1636
01:10:34.568 --> 01:10:35.903
Itsy.

1637
01:10:35.903 --> 01:10:37.237
And I'm sorry. I was
just focused on trying

1638
01:10:37.237 --> 01:10:38.197
to get back to my old life.
so I was self-centered.

1639
01:10:38.197 --> 01:10:39.239
and selfish. and a jerk!

1640
01:10:39.239 --> 01:10:39.948
Itsy.

1641
01:10:41.992 --> 01:10:42.993
You're right.

1642
01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:45.913
You don't have to
agree that quickly.

1643
01:10:45.913 --> 01:10:49.041
No. no. what I
mean is I've realized

1644
01:10:50.584 --> 01:10:53.045
I've spent so much time thinking
about leaving this planet.

1645
01:10:53.045 --> 01:10:56.006
I haven't thought about
what I'd do if I stayed.

1646
01:10:56.006 --> 01:10:58.217
So I came here to say goodbye.

1647
01:10:58.217 --> 01:11:00.552
Not to Earth. but to my dad.

1648
01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:07.017
I have to move on.

1649
01:11:07.017 --> 01:11:09.520
I can't keep pretending like
he's coming back for me.

1650
01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.896
or that UFOs exist-

1651
01:11:10.896 --> 01:11:12.648
No. but they do exist!

1652
01:11:12.648 --> 01:11:14.233
Calvin. you were
right about the UFOs.

1653
01:11:14.233 --> 01:11:15.776
but you were wrong
about the location.

1654
01:11:15.776 --> 01:11:17.945
We're supposed to be
two miles that way.

1655
01:11:17.945 --> 01:11:19.154
You might be a genius.

1656
01:11:19.154 --> 01:11:20.948
but you're still
horrible at fractions.

1657
01:11:22.824 --> 01:11:23.784
I was right?

1658
01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:24.785
You were right.

1659
01:11:24.785 --> 01:11:25.827
My dad was abducted by aliens?

1660
01:11:25.827 --> 01:11:28.872
Your dad was totally
abducted by aliens!

1661
01:11:28.872 --> 01:11:30.165
We've got 23 minutes.

1662
01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:31.083
Okay. we need to go.

1663
01:11:41.927 --> 01:11:43.846

1669
01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:06.243
We made it.

1670
01:12:10.956 --> 01:12:11.999
Okay. it's coming.

1671
01:12:11.999 --> 01:12:13.542
It's coming.

1672
01:12:14.877 --> 01:12:16.003
There it is!

1673
01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:23.635
It's so beautiful.

1674
01:12:30.851 --> 01:12:32.811
Okay. okay. get ready.

1675
01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.873
Calvin?

1676
01:12:54.458 --> 01:12:57.044
I really thought
he was coming.

1677
01:12:58.587 --> 01:12:59.838
Are you okay?

1678
01:13:05.302 --> 01:13:06.178
I'm okay.

1679
01:13:09.598 --> 01:13:11.642
I think I'm finally okay.

1680
01:13:14.186 --> 01:13:17.356
I've got everything
I need right here.

1681
01:13:18.982 --> 01:13:20.150
Let's go home.

1682
01:13:56.311 --> 01:13:57.604
Calvin. look.

1683
01:14:12.369 --> 01:14:13.662
Pardon?

1684
01:14:16.206 --> 01:14:18.333
Nice to meet you. buddy.

1685
01:14:20.002 --> 01:14:23.797
Oh. yeah. it's nice
to meet you too. buddy.

1686
01:14:27.342 --> 01:14:28.093
Calvin?

1687
01:14:34.892 --> 01:14:35.642
Dad?

1688
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:40.772
Dad!

1689
01:14:55.078 --> 01:14:56.163
Oh. Calvin.

1690
01:14:57.039 --> 01:14:58.498
I can't believe you're here.

1691
01:14:58.498 --> 01:14:59.791
Me?

1692
01:14:59.791 --> 01:15:00.959
I can't believe
that you're here.

1693
01:15:00.959 --> 01:15:01.877
And look at you.

1694
01:15:01.877 --> 01:15:03.003
You're huge!

1695
01:15:03.003 --> 01:15:03.921
Look at you!

1696
01:15:03.921 --> 01:15:06.131
You look. the exact same.

1697
01:15:06.131 --> 01:15:07.716
Yeah. it's crazy. right?

1698
01:15:07.716 --> 01:15:09.843
Yeah. there's something
about chasing Jesper's Comet

1699
01:15:09.843 --> 01:15:11.345
that stops you from aging.

1700
01:15:11.345 --> 01:15:14.306
You know. I've been up
in space for 109 years.

1701
01:15:14.306 --> 01:15:17.684
Wait. so how many earth years
have passed since I left?

1702
01:15:17.684 --> 01:15:19.436
You've been gone
for 10 years. Dad.

1703
01:15:19.436 --> 01:15:22.064
Oh. I'm so sorry. son.

1704
01:15:22.064 --> 01:15:24.858
Look. I've been trying to reach
you since the moment I left.

1705
01:15:24.858 --> 01:15:27.945
Did you get my message
about pancakes?

1706
01:15:27.945 --> 01:15:29.947
I knew that was you.

1707
01:15:29.947 --> 01:15:31.865
Well. I'm here now.

1708
01:15:36.828 --> 01:15:38.539
Calvin?

1709
01:15:42.042 --> 01:15:43.126
Who's this?

1710
01:15:43.126 --> 01:15:44.253
Hi. I'm Itsy.

1711
01:15:44.253 --> 01:15:45.045
Oh. hi. Itsy.

1712
01:15:45.045 --> 01:15:47.881
I'm Cyrus. Calvin's dad.

1713
01:15:47.881 --> 01:15:49.716
Are you. uh...

1714
01:15:49.716 --> 01:15:51.885
Well. it's um...

1715
01:15:51.885 --> 01:15:53.428
I'm his girlfriend.

1716
01:15:53.428 --> 01:15:55.681
I see. all right.

1717
01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:56.974
Hmm.

1718
01:15:56.974 --> 01:15:58.851
Well. it's very nice
to meet you. Itsy.

1719
01:15:58.851 --> 01:16:00.477
Nice to meet buddy.

1720
01:16:04.857 --> 01:16:06.567
Wait. Dad. your hair.

1721
01:16:06.567 --> 01:16:07.734
You're getting older.

1722
01:16:07.734 --> 01:16:09.069
Oh no.

1723
01:16:09.069 --> 01:16:10.863
I was afraid this would happen.

1724
01:16:10.863 --> 01:16:11.780
What's going on?

1725
01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.198
Time is catching up to me.

1726
01:16:13.198 --> 01:16:14.992
That 109 years I spent in space

1727
01:16:14.992 --> 01:16:18.036
must be affecting
me all at once.

1728
01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:29.131
Okay.

1729
01:16:29.131 --> 01:16:30.299
What are they saying?

1730
01:16:30.299 --> 01:16:32.801
Well. the bad news is uh...

1731
01:16:34.303 --> 01:16:35.554
You can't stay.

1732
01:16:35.554 --> 01:16:36.388
Well. no.

1733
01:16:36.388 --> 01:16:37.723
I can.

1734
01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:39.349
I've come all this
way to see you.

1735
01:16:39.349 --> 01:16:40.684
I'm staying here.

1736
01:16:40.684 --> 01:16:44.062
Dad. you've aged 20
years in five minutes.

1737
01:16:44.062 --> 01:16:47.691
Another 15 and you'll have
aged 60 years and probably die.

1738
01:16:47.691 --> 01:16:49.026
You need to go.

1739
01:16:49.026 --> 01:16:50.068
All right.

1740
01:16:50.068 --> 01:16:51.695
Give me a second.

1741
01:16:59.912 --> 01:17:01.830
Okay. great news.

1742
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:03.624
They said that you
guys can come with us.

1743
01:17:03.624 --> 01:17:05.834
Yeah. but we need to
leave ASAP. all right.

1744
01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:08.253
These guys are kind of obsessed
with chasing Jesper's Comet

1745
01:17:08.253 --> 01:17:10.547
because they think the tail
tastes like cotton candy.

1746
01:17:10.547 --> 01:17:12.341
By the way. it's very good.

1747
01:17:12.341 --> 01:17:13.217
Cotton candy?

1748
01:17:13.217 --> 01:17:14.718
Yeah.

1749
01:17:14.718 --> 01:17:15.969
But the tails of
comets are mostly made up

1750
01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:17.971
of ionized gases and
metallic microparticles.

1751
01:17:17.971 --> 01:17:19.932
Oh. my sweet. sweet boy.

1752
01:17:19.932 --> 01:17:22.434
There's so much
for you to learn.

1753
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:25.812
Oh. there's the departure bell.

1754
01:17:25.812 --> 01:17:26.605
Come on. let's go.

1755
01:17:26.605 --> 01:17:27.648
We better go.

1756
01:17:29.233 --> 01:17:29.983
Calvin.

1757
01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:32.945
I can't leave.

1758
01:17:32.945 --> 01:17:34.196
My family's here.

1759
01:17:37.449 --> 01:17:38.534
But my dad.

1760
01:17:40.202 --> 01:17:40.994
I know.

1761
01:17:48.544 --> 01:17:49.294
You go.

1762
01:17:52.756 --> 01:17:53.507
Calvin?

1763
01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:03.600
Come on.

1764
01:18:06.311 --> 01:18:07.479
Dad. I. I...

1765
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:11.191
Yeah. it's okay.

1766
01:18:11.191 --> 01:18:12.860
I understand.

1767
01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:17.573
Just know I'll be up
there looking down on you.

1768
01:18:17.573 --> 01:18:20.325
Oh. I'm so proud of you. Son.

1769
01:18:20.325 --> 01:18:21.702
So proud of you.

1770
01:18:31.128 --> 01:18:32.796
Love you. kiddo.

1771
01:18:32.796 --> 01:18:34.715
Love you. too. Dad.

1772
01:18:41.722 --> 01:18:43.682
And hey. the
comet will be making

1773
01:18:43.682 --> 01:18:46.018
its way back around to
Earth every 10 years.

1774
01:18:46.018 --> 01:18:48.103
Maybe one day you guys
will change your minds

1775
01:18:48.103 --> 01:18:49.938
and wanna come with us.

1776
01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:18.884
Wait. look.

1777
01:19:21.011 --> 01:19:22.763
Make a wish. Calvin.

1778
01:19:26.016 --> 01:19:28.769
Well. um. if now
is a good time.
