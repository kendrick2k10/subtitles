00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.727
She arrived first.
sat waiting for 30 minutes

5
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.816
and boyfriend shows up.

6
00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:03.906
They usually hang.
have some drinks. then head out.

7
00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:05.255
A romance.

8
00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:07.170
Something.

9
00:02:09.172 --> 00:02:10.913
Come on. guys.
We can't stop now.

10
00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:13.002
A few more and who knows...

11
00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:15.309
And who knows what might happen.

12
00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:18.703
No. no. not enough for that yet.
Come on. pay up.

13
00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:21.010
What's all that?

14
00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:22.664
She comes through
every week or so.

15
00:02:22.838 --> 00:02:25.057
talks to guys.
gets 'em to buy her drinks.

16
00:02:25.797 --> 00:02:27.886
disappears before anything bad
can happen.

17
00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.324
As long as there's no trouble.
I let it slide.

18
00:02:30.498 --> 00:02:32.021
Yeah.

19
00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:34.154
Besides. she tips good
with other people's money.

20
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.465
- A little dark?
- Sure thing.

21
00:02:58.221 --> 00:02:59.266
He's coming over.

22
00:02:59.918 --> 00:03:02.269
- I know.
- Can I have another round?

23
00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:03.922
Who the fuck are you?

24
00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:05.489
I'm gonna need you
to give me that camera.

25
00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:06.490
No.

26
00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:10.146
I could have-
- I know you are Dexter Conell.

27
00:03:10.668 --> 00:03:12.104
Yeah. One of four partners

28
00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:15.717
at Conell. Ajax and O'Connor.

29
00:03:15.891 --> 00:03:19.199
Yeah. You know.
I've been hired by your firm.

30
00:03:19.982 --> 00:03:24.073
I mean. to say your partners.
including your wife. Elizabeth.

31
00:03:24.247 --> 00:03:27.337
Yeah. Just to see who
you are stepping out with.

32
00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:31.080
And you. you are Ashley. right?

33
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.952
- Hi.
Hey.

34
00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:35.476
You're the mail girl?

35
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.304
I'm an assistant. actually.

36
00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:40.655
Yeah. well.
just some advice. Ashley.

37
00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:44.136
don't fall for the first
swinging dick douche bag.

38
00:03:44.311 --> 00:03:46.487
especially. if they own
the firm. You know?

39
00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:48.750
You're better than that.

40
00:03:48.924 --> 00:03:50.360
Listen. you son of a bitch.

41
00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:52.362
you have no right
to be invading my privacy.

42
00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:55.931
You don't have an expectation
of privacy in public. no.

43
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.977
But I do have something for you.

44
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:02.285
Here. you've been served.

45
00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.123
- Oh.

46
00:04:14.297 --> 00:04:15.298
Go. go.

47
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:19.955
Maybe it's better
if you just head for the door

48
00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:22.218
and don't make it any worse
than it already is.

49
00:04:32.924 --> 00:04:34.099
You saw that?

50
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:35.536
Man was threatening.

51
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.885
Yeah. definitely threatening.

52
00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:38.147
Hey. thanks.

53
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.107
No. I mean. thank you
for telling the girl to leave.

54
00:04:43.195 --> 00:04:45.285
- Oh. no. No worries.
Yeah.

55
00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:50.594
All right. boys.

56
00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:53.336
this is the last round.

57
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.251
After this. I'm leaving.

58
00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:59.386
Not if we don't let you leave.

59
00:04:59.647 --> 00:05:03.215
Oh. baby. that is a road
you do not want to go down.

60
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.479
And I'm calling you baby.
because...

61
00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:09.309
I don't remember
any of your names.

62
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.528
You all just look
the same to me.

63
00:05:12.268 --> 00:05:13.313
But after I leave.

64
00:05:13.487 --> 00:05:15.053
whatever you do.
don't follow me.

65
00:05:15.227 --> 00:05:17.621
because as fucked up as I am.

66
00:05:17.795 --> 00:05:21.277
I could cause each and every one
of you serious...

67
00:05:21.843 --> 00:05:23.235
physical harm.

68
00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:48.304
Shit.

69
00:05:49.218 --> 00:05:52.308
- You want me to call the law?
- No. not yet.

70
00:06:04.842 --> 00:06:07.279
Let our friend go
and we won't hurt you.

71
00:06:07.454 --> 00:06:08.411
Much.

72
00:06:08.977 --> 00:06:10.805
- Oh. hey!

73
00:06:11.588 --> 00:06:12.502
Hi.

74
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:18.508
Go away. old man!

75
00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:20.728
Old man? Wow.

76
00:06:28.997 --> 00:06:30.390
So. now what are you gonna do?

77
00:06:34.306 --> 00:06:36.657
There's nothing really
you can do. I have the gun.

78
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:39.094
- I would drop the baton.

79
00:06:39.268 --> 00:06:40.922
Good. thank you.

80
00:06:41.096 --> 00:06:43.054
Now take your friends
and get the fuck out of here.

81
00:06:43.228 --> 00:06:44.273
Yes. sir.

82
00:06:46.275 --> 00:06:48.190
Thank you. eh?
Thank you very much.

83
00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:53.325
I'm just gonna
get my bag there. so...

84
00:06:56.154 --> 00:06:57.852
- Right then.
- Are you okay?

85
00:06:58.026 --> 00:06:59.070
Yeah.

86
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.942
That was...

87
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.031
'Cause in there you carried
yourself a bit differently.

88
00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:04.946
so you... I mean.
that was quite...

89
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.426
That was quite impressive.

90
00:07:10.517 --> 00:07:13.128
Well... are you happy of...

91
00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:15.347
living a life...

92
00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:19.700
that leads you
to situations like that?

93
00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:21.876
It's...

94
00:07:23.007 --> 00:07:24.922
You know. kind of pathetic.

95
00:07:25.488 --> 00:07:26.663
- Oh.
- Don't you think?

96
00:07:28.143 --> 00:07:29.187
Right.

97
00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:33.278
Uh...
Well. most people would say.

98
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.845
"You're welcome.
Have a nice life."

99
00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:37.021
But you. you have
a "you're a piece of shit"

100
00:07:37.195 --> 00:07:38.675
- bedside manner.
- No. no. no. no.

101
00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:40.634
I didn't say that
you are a piece of shit

102
00:07:40.808 --> 00:07:42.244
because you are not one.

103
00:07:44.202 --> 00:07:45.377
You're a drunk.

104
00:07:48.293 --> 00:07:49.381
And one day

105
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.559
it'll kill you. slowly. it will.

106
00:08:01.306 --> 00:08:03.787
Are you tired of being a drunk?

107
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:36.994
This cocktail thing. man.

108
00:08:37.168 --> 00:08:39.040
you know. 20 odd years
in Dublin.

109
00:08:39.214 --> 00:08:40.215
get through that.

110
00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:42.870
go back to where I grew up.

111
00:08:43.044 --> 00:08:44.785
become Detective Sergeant.

112
00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:47.178
and spent a few years
like that yank Andy Griffith.

113
00:08:47.352 --> 00:08:49.920
No. Worst thing Andy ever faced
was a town drunk.

114
00:08:51.792 --> 00:08:53.315
You had rich people
getting themselves killed.

115
00:08:53.489 --> 00:08:55.839
Yeah. and some other rich people
running interference.

116
00:08:56.013 --> 00:08:57.885
Then out of nowhere.
my lead investigator

117
00:08:58.059 --> 00:09:00.931
or my only investigator.
gets a job consulting.

118
00:09:01.628 --> 00:09:02.933
three times the pay.

119
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.241
- Maybe they'll offer me a job.

120
00:09:06.415 --> 00:09:07.895
So. listen. uh.

121
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:10.506
I know you are bringing me
on this site. man.

122
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.856
Isn't stuff like this
need to be approved by...

123
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:15.729
your superintendent
or the bureau?

124
00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:18.514
No. we need to keep this
on the down low.

125
00:09:18.688 --> 00:09:19.863
There's too many
important people

126
00:09:20.037 --> 00:09:21.299
that don't want this
be looked at.

127
00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:23.432
so no one's
gonna investigate it.

128
00:09:30.004 --> 00:09:33.050
I'll come by at 930
and go over today's interviews.

129
00:09:33.834 --> 00:09:35.705
I can't figure
these bastards out.

130
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.620
- Some hinky shit.
- Yeah.

131
00:09:37.794 --> 00:09:39.100
Wanna grab your bag
from the office?

132
00:09:39.274 --> 00:09:40.405
No. I'm gonna go
back to the room

133
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.624
and just take a nap.

134
00:09:41.798 --> 00:09:42.843
- Okay.
- Okay.

135
00:09:43.017 --> 00:09:44.105
- See you later.
- See ya. Bye.

136
00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.073
Excuse me.

137
00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:27.888
You thought you could find me?

138
00:10:28.802 --> 00:10:29.846
I found you first.

139
00:11:40.656 --> 00:11:42.614
- Mm.

140
00:11:45.617 --> 00:11:46.836
Hello?

141
00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:48.142
Hello?

142
00:11:58.369 --> 00:11:59.327
Sorry. what?

143
00:12:04.985 --> 00:12:07.204
Oh. um.
I don't need your address.

144
00:12:07.378 --> 00:12:09.467
No. I don't need
to write it down.

145
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:12.166
I know where it is.

146
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.210
I'm...

147
00:12:14.603 --> 00:12:16.083
I'm two hours away. I'll need...

148
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.871
I'll need three hours.
I'll be there at 9:00. Bye.

149
00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:24.891
Fuck.

150
00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:29.460
Fuck.

151
00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:35.858
Fuck.

152
00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:44.127
One year.

153
00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:46.173
Yeah.

154
00:13:46.869 --> 00:13:47.914
Who would've thunk?

155
00:13:49.045 --> 00:13:50.003
Me.

156
00:13:50.568 --> 00:13:51.656
I have faith.

157
00:13:52.396 --> 00:13:55.878
Well. I'm glad you did
'cause sometimes I wondered.

158
00:13:56.096 --> 00:13:57.706
When you wondered. you called.

159
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.056
That's how this works.

160
00:14:04.104 --> 00:14:06.976
I know they gave you
the one last night. but...

161
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.545
I think this one might be a...

162
00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:12.199
a better fit.

163
00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.288
If you want it. of course.

164
00:14:17.465 --> 00:14:18.727
Grateful I'm not dead.

165
00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:22.339
That's perfect.

166
00:14:26.604 --> 00:14:28.389
No. I will not bloody cry.

167
00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:33.916
Thank you.

168
00:14:37.137 --> 00:14:38.312
You're a dickhead.

169
00:14:41.924 --> 00:14:42.882
Well.

170
00:15:22.617 --> 00:15:24.532
You worked for Tallini
for how long?

171
00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:27.187
Three years. and a couple
of years before that

172
00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:28.449
doing research.

173
00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:31.800
I'm quite good at research.

174
00:15:32.366 --> 00:15:34.498
Yeah. he mentioned that.
information studies.

175
00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:36.022
He spoke about me?

176
00:15:42.289 --> 00:15:44.204
Yeah. Yes. Information Studies.

177
00:15:45.292 --> 00:15:47.250
He was also my sponsor and...

178
00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:51.776
um. last night I fucked it up.

179
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.041
No. it happens. I don't judge
and neither would he.

180
00:15:56.042 --> 00:15:58.566
If you want there's a place
nearby to take a meeting.

181
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:00.872
Um...

182
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:04.311
What I really want is
to pick up Mikeal's case.

183
00:16:04.485 --> 00:16:06.530
I owe Mikeal
for a thousand things.

184
00:16:06.704 --> 00:16:08.532
and I really think
that I would be good at this.

185
00:16:08.706 --> 00:16:10.752
and I promise you
that I am ready to take on--

186
00:16:10.926 --> 00:16:12.188
Detective Sergeant.

187
00:16:13.407 --> 00:16:14.451
Good morning.

188
00:16:16.932 --> 00:16:18.542
It appears you and I

189
00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:20.936
need to have
yet another conversation

190
00:16:21.197 --> 00:16:23.112
about this--
this little witch hunt

191
00:16:23.286 --> 00:16:25.680
you're orchestrating
against my client.

192
00:16:25.854 --> 00:16:27.247
This witch hunt
you're referring to

193
00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:29.162
is an investigation
into the murder

194
00:16:29.336 --> 00:16:30.598
of one of your clients

195
00:16:30.772 --> 00:16:31.903
who's also a golfing buddy.

196
00:16:32.078 --> 00:16:33.253
and I don't know.

197
00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:35.081
secret sect member.

198
00:16:35.255 --> 00:16:36.952
something.

199
00:16:37.126 --> 00:16:40.086
Well. the only relationship
germane to this conversation

200
00:16:40.695 --> 00:16:42.392
is that of solicitor and client.

201
00:16:42.566 --> 00:16:44.090
and my clients

202
00:16:44.264 --> 00:16:46.353
are private people.

203
00:16:47.223 --> 00:16:49.965
They don't take very well
to your little private Gestapo.

204
00:16:50.139 --> 00:16:52.924
God. witch hunt. Gestapo.
is there any other metaphors

205
00:16:53.099 --> 00:16:54.491
you wanna throw
into this conversation?

206
00:16:54.665 --> 00:16:55.840
Well.
I don't know. maybe.

207
00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.320
Let me introduce you
to Cassie Holt.

208
00:16:57.494 --> 00:16:58.408
Hi.

209
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.498
She's a colleague
of my late friend

210
00:17:01.672 --> 00:17:02.934
and private Gestapo.

211
00:17:03.109 --> 00:17:04.327
Mikeal Tallini.

212
00:17:05.937 --> 00:17:07.548
I'm sorry. did you say late?

213
00:17:09.115 --> 00:17:10.638
He was stabbed to death.

214
00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:12.292
much like your former client.

215
00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:14.685
And his wounds were excessive.

216
00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:16.078
much like your former client.

217
00:17:17.166 --> 00:17:21.866
Jesus. my... my deepest
sympathies for your loss.

218
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:23.564
Yeah. maybe now you'll...

219
00:17:23.738 --> 00:17:25.696
you'll call off this
absurd little investigation.

220
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:27.046
Well. you see. I can't now

221
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.786
because
it's an international crime.

222
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.049
I'm sorry. what?

223
00:17:30.745 --> 00:17:33.400
The laws on the murder
of a law enforcement officer

224
00:17:33.574 --> 00:17:35.402
extend past service and borders.

225
00:17:35.576 --> 00:17:37.317
So. if I make
one phone call here.

226
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:39.971
it's gonna rain investigators
all over the fucking place.

227
00:17:40.146 --> 00:17:42.974
And I'm sure their departments
will be interested in a cabal.

228
00:17:43.149 --> 00:17:45.368
Yeah. Victor.
I've read up on your history

229
00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:50.373
wherein you had investigators
close this case prematurely.

230
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.942
which now might be related
to the murder

231
00:17:54.116 --> 00:17:55.813
of a brother investigator.

232
00:17:56.336 --> 00:17:58.990
I hereby appoint you.
Cassie Holt.

233
00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:02.342
special investigator
to the murder of Mikeal Tallini.

234
00:18:02.516 --> 00:18:03.386
Catch.

235
00:18:04.735 --> 00:18:07.042
Actually. while you're here.
Victor. would you mind?

236
00:18:07.216 --> 00:18:08.652
We need a witness
while she signs.

237
00:18:08.826 --> 00:18:11.133
Absolutely. Do you want me to--
Go fuck yourself!

238
00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:14.484
I'll show myself out.

239
00:18:14.832 --> 00:18:16.269
Yeah. please do.

240
00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.966
Sharon. actually.

241
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.011
would you mind
witnessing this because... Yeah.

242
00:18:20.186 --> 00:18:21.622
And get her ID'd up. Thanks.

243
00:18:30.979 --> 00:18:32.372
Well. there she is.

244
00:18:33.329 --> 00:18:35.505
- It's about god damn time.
What do you want?

245
00:18:36.071 --> 00:18:38.073
Well. he's hired
another fucking PI.

246
00:18:38.291 --> 00:18:39.640
Hmm. Really?

247
00:18:39.814 --> 00:18:41.337
Some girl who used
to work for Tallini...

248
00:18:41.511 --> 00:18:43.470
- Hmm.
- ...who turns out is dead.

249
00:18:44.253 --> 00:18:45.428
Did you have anything
to do with that?

250
00:18:45.602 --> 00:18:47.735
No. Categorically not.
Had no idea.

251
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:49.302
You're sure about that?

252
00:18:49.476 --> 00:18:51.086
Yeah.
I don't like you bastards enough

253
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.566
to help you without being paid.

254
00:18:53.523 --> 00:18:55.917
The feeling
is absolutely mutual.

255
00:18:57.875 --> 00:18:59.486
You're in it
just as deep as the rest of us.

256
00:19:00.356 --> 00:19:02.053
If one of us goes down.

257
00:19:02.228 --> 00:19:04.534
you remember
what I've got on you.

258
00:19:04.708 --> 00:19:06.754
Oh. spare me the threats.
tough guy.

259
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.409
Do you want me to find out
what I can on this new PI?

260
00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.280
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

261
00:19:11.802 --> 00:19:13.456
- Give me a couple of hours.
- I will.

262
00:19:14.065 --> 00:19:15.284
So. what do you think?

263
00:19:16.242 --> 00:19:17.199
I make it official?

264
00:19:17.373 --> 00:19:18.461
Well. I thought you'd never ask.

265
00:19:19.462 --> 00:19:20.768
Wait. are we getting married
or...

266
00:19:20.942 --> 00:19:22.291
- No.
- ...are you offering me a job?

267
00:19:22.465 --> 00:19:25.076
No. Married one time.
One time only.

268
00:19:25.251 --> 00:19:27.557
No. no.
this is about work. you <i>tonta.</i>

269
00:19:27.731 --> 00:19:29.298
<i>Tonta?</i> Hardly.

270
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.257
You have seen
the better part of the job

271
00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:33.041
over the last couple of years.

272
00:19:33.302 --> 00:19:35.609
Now I'll show you
how to run a business.

273
00:19:36.262 --> 00:19:37.828
fine tune investigation.

274
00:19:38.002 --> 00:19:40.266
and how to protect yourself.
how to shoot.

275
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.354
I get a gun?

276
00:19:41.528 --> 00:19:43.399
Eh! Keep it down.

277
00:19:45.532 --> 00:19:47.925
But. yeah.
you can carry it and--

278
00:19:48.317 --> 00:19:50.798
- Okay.
- Once licensed. Okay? Yeah.

279
00:19:51.581 --> 00:19:52.539
Right.

280
00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:00.460
- This is easy to hide.
- Yep.

281
00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:04.594
Nasty little bullets that go
and can fuck up someone's day.

282
00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:06.161
Open it.

283
00:20:07.118 --> 00:20:08.642
Open it. Right. Okay.

284
00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:12.298
Heavier than it looks.
- Oh. God.

285
00:20:12.863 --> 00:20:15.431
Easy to shoot.
Yeah. Okay. Right.

286
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.477
Lovely.

287
00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:21.132
Cassie?

288
00:20:22.133 --> 00:20:23.134
Cassie!

289
00:20:23.613 --> 00:20:25.267
Sorry. Sorry.
I didn't hear you. what?

290
00:20:26.834 --> 00:20:28.096
Are you packing?

291
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:30.316
Well. I'm a single girl
living in a shitty part of town.

292
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.665
and my best friend
was just murdered.

293
00:20:31.839 --> 00:20:33.188
so yeah. I'm packing. why?

294
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:36.409
Is it a Walther
with the letter E on the grip?

295
00:20:37.801 --> 00:20:38.846
It is.

296
00:20:39.586 --> 00:20:40.630
How did you know?

297
00:20:41.501 --> 00:20:43.372
It's Ellie's. Mikeal's wife.

298
00:20:51.162 --> 00:20:52.381
That I did not know.

299
00:20:54.514 --> 00:20:58.039
Here's notes on the interviews
Mikeal tried to conduct.

300
00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:00.607
Let's just bring you
up the speed.

301
00:21:17.841 --> 00:21:20.888
<i>We're gonna have
so much fun tonight.</i>

302
00:21:22.063 --> 00:21:23.586
<i>Come here.</i>

303
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.024
<i>We're not gonna hurt you.
just come here.</i>

304
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.034
Fuck.

305
00:21:59.927 --> 00:22:00.797
Wallace...

306
00:22:01.581 --> 00:22:03.278
Now. outside of punctuality.

307
00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:05.367
you need to learn hierarchy.

308
00:22:06.586 --> 00:22:08.065
See. you work for me.

309
00:22:08.892 --> 00:22:11.199
You don't call me
and tell me where to meet you.

310
00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:13.680
Oh. I'd be happy
to come to your office.

311
00:22:14.115 --> 00:22:15.334
but someone might see us.

312
00:22:15.508 --> 00:22:16.813
Makes it a little bit
more difficult.

313
00:22:16.987 --> 00:22:18.554
one of your buddies
decides to accidentally

314
00:22:18.728 --> 00:22:20.034
- kill someone again.
- Ah. Jesus. That was one time.

315
00:22:20.208 --> 00:22:22.036
Now do you want
this profile or not?

316
00:22:22.428 --> 00:22:23.603
- Let's hear it.
Okay.

317
00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:26.475
It's Catherine Elate Holt.

318
00:22:26.649 --> 00:22:28.738
She's 35 years old
born in London.

319
00:22:28.912 --> 00:22:31.350
She went to LCC
for her Library Science degree.

320
00:22:31.959 --> 00:22:33.613
She worked
at a couple city libraries.

321
00:22:33.787 --> 00:22:36.006
- but got fired for being drunk.
- Ha!

322
00:22:36.703 --> 00:22:38.792
After being fired.
she moved here.

323
00:22:39.793 --> 00:22:42.056
became an AA member.
met Tallini.

324
00:22:42.448 --> 00:22:44.101
He became her sponsor.

325
00:22:44.754 --> 00:22:46.016
and he eventually
started hiring her

326
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.627
for doing some
of his small jobs.

327
00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:49.019
Have you got a picture of her?

328
00:22:50.194 --> 00:22:52.153
- Yep.
- Oh.

329
00:22:52.327 --> 00:22:54.285
- He's probably fucking her.

330
00:22:56.679 --> 00:22:59.508
She had reoccurring sexual abuse
by her step-grandfather.

331
00:22:59.856 --> 00:23:01.989
started at a young age
up until university.

332
00:23:02.946 --> 00:23:04.644
She came home for the break.
He tried again.

333
00:23:04.818 --> 00:23:06.689
- She kicked his ass.
- Ooh.

334
00:23:07.821 --> 00:23:09.344
No one told the old man
that she's taking

335
00:23:09.518 --> 00:23:11.781
- Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

336
00:23:11.955 --> 00:23:13.783
He went away
for a couple of years.

337
00:23:14.871 --> 00:23:16.873
Well. his solicitor
was probably shite.

338
00:23:17.483 --> 00:23:19.354
Those allegations
are easy enough to deflect.

339
00:23:20.703 --> 00:23:23.227
Well. she started hiding
her phone in secondary school

340
00:23:23.532 --> 00:23:25.404
and started videotaping
the assaults.

341
00:23:25.578 --> 00:23:26.405
Damn!

342
00:23:28.494 --> 00:23:29.582
Do you want deeper?

343
00:23:29.756 --> 00:23:31.366
No. this is good enough.

344
00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:33.716
Just gives us a heads up
who we're dealing with.

345
00:23:34.543 --> 00:23:36.719
She's not as experienced
as Tallini. see?

346
00:23:37.372 --> 00:23:38.547
So. I'm not that worried.

347
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.158
Oh. There's your money.

348
00:23:41.507 --> 00:23:42.551
Yeah. Thank you.

349
00:23:43.857 --> 00:23:44.858
Give it to me.

350
00:23:49.036 --> 00:23:50.994
And we left the pub
late afternoon.

351
00:23:51.168 --> 00:23:53.649
Mikeal went west
towards his hotel.

352
00:23:53.954 --> 00:23:55.521
and I went home.

353
00:23:56.783 --> 00:23:57.827
I can't.

354
00:23:58.611 --> 00:23:59.568
Focus.

355
00:24:01.004 --> 00:24:02.702
Look. I know it's hard. but...

356
00:24:03.311 --> 00:24:06.096
eventually.
you build up these compartments

357
00:24:06.706 --> 00:24:09.448
and I'm not sure
if it's healthy. but it works.

358
00:24:11.406 --> 00:24:14.104
All right. photo number three
shows how the body was found.

359
00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:15.715
The positioning
leads us to believe

360
00:24:15.889 --> 00:24:18.108
that the killer
came from behind.

361
00:24:18.282 --> 00:24:20.154
The decedent. Mikeal. turned

362
00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:21.634
and he was stabbed

363
00:24:21.808 --> 00:24:23.026
<i>- eight times.</i>

364
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:25.115
And after he hit the ground.

365
00:24:25.812 --> 00:24:27.596
the coup de grace
was the cutting

366
00:24:27.857 --> 00:24:28.945
of the carotid artery.

367
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:31.687
His pockets were gone through.

368
00:24:31.861 --> 00:24:34.124
his phone and his room key
were taken.

369
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.039
His ID was left beside the body.

370
00:24:36.213 --> 00:24:37.780
and his gun was left
in the holster.

371
00:24:37.954 --> 00:24:40.957
Yes. they didn't take the gun.
That doesn't make sense.

372
00:24:41.218 --> 00:24:43.003
No. it does not.

373
00:24:43.177 --> 00:24:45.179
It was also incredibly ballsy
to attack him in broad daylight.

374
00:24:48.356 --> 00:24:50.053
I... I...

375
00:24:50.227 --> 00:24:52.578
Well. I suppose
we should go to the hotel.

376
00:24:52.752 --> 00:24:53.796
Agreed.

377
00:25:01.412 --> 00:25:02.631
Why can't I go?

378
00:25:03.806 --> 00:25:06.592
Mainly because my man
doesn't have the value

379
00:25:06.766 --> 00:25:08.376
to pay for two investigators.

380
00:25:08.942 --> 00:25:10.726
Second. I need you
to run the office

381
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.293
while I am down there.

382
00:25:12.772 --> 00:25:14.208
- But it's a murder.
- Mm. Yeah.

383
00:25:14.382 --> 00:25:15.905
You said that hardly
ever happens in our world.

384
00:25:16.079 --> 00:25:17.777
The last time
a private investigator

385
00:25:17.951 --> 00:25:20.388
solved a murder
was like never. ever.

386
00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:23.434
What if some hard boiled
film noir shit happens?

387
00:25:23.609 --> 00:25:24.958
Like what?

388
00:25:25.132 --> 00:25:26.263
Well. I don't know.
you've seen movies.

389
00:25:26.437 --> 00:25:27.917
No. none of that is gonna happen

390
00:25:28.091 --> 00:25:29.789
because those things
don't happen in real life.

391
00:25:30.311 --> 00:25:33.836
All I'm gonna do is interview
friends of the dead guy.

392
00:25:34.184 --> 00:25:36.360
just to see
if they have any idea

393
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.624
of who wanted
their friend killed.

394
00:25:38.798 --> 00:25:39.973
That's it.

395
00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:44.151
Meanwhile. you run the office
for the week I am gone.

396
00:25:44.325 --> 00:25:46.327
continue tracking the--
the money trail

397
00:25:46.501 --> 00:25:48.198
and that construction thing.

398
00:25:48.372 --> 00:25:50.026
and when I am back. well.

399
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.420
we'll present it
to the client's solicitor

400
00:25:52.594 --> 00:25:55.031
and we get paid. and that's it.

401
00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:57.164
Okay.

402
00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.820
- But I'm officially protesting.
- Noted and filed. Yeah.

403
00:26:01.342 --> 00:26:03.083
- And you have to promise me.
- No. no. no.

404
00:26:03.257 --> 00:26:07.261
If some film noir shit happens.
I'll call you.

405
00:26:07.435 --> 00:26:08.262
- Okay.
- Okay?

406
00:26:08.436 --> 00:26:09.219
- All right.
- Okay.

407
00:26:09.393 --> 00:26:10.394
- Deal.
- Yeah.

408
00:26:25.453 --> 00:26:26.933
Hi. Cassie.
Nice to meet you.

409
00:26:27.107 --> 00:26:28.412
Hi. Cassie. Glenn.

410
00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:29.805
- Nice to meet you.
Hi. Glenn.

411
00:26:29.979 --> 00:26:31.502
Glenn. thanks for
sitting out here.

412
00:26:31.677 --> 00:26:32.852
How's it going?

413
00:26:33.026 --> 00:26:34.505
This is Cassie.
She worked with Tallini.

414
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.029
Yeah. we just met. Yeah.

415
00:26:36.203 --> 00:26:37.552
Yeah. She's gonna be
helping us out here.

416
00:26:37.726 --> 00:26:39.119
Okay. Perfect.
Picked this up last night.

417
00:26:39.293 --> 00:26:41.338
Ah. good call. Anything weird?
Did you go in?

418
00:26:41.512 --> 00:26:43.514
I did not. Nope.
Just sat up on it and watched.

419
00:26:43.689 --> 00:26:45.168
Okay. cool.

420
00:26:45.342 --> 00:26:46.648
Right. well. then we're gonna go
check out the room

421
00:26:46.822 --> 00:26:48.084
and you go ahead.
go home. get some rest.

422
00:26:48.258 --> 00:26:49.346
- Will do.
Nice to meet you.

423
00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.521
Nice to meet you.

424
00:27:25.513 --> 00:27:28.124
Whatever they were looking for.
I'm guessing they didn't find.

425
00:27:28.472 --> 00:27:30.126
What time did your man get here?

426
00:27:31.214 --> 00:27:32.694
Got here right at 10:00.

427
00:27:32.868 --> 00:27:35.305
I got the call at 8:00
that Mik's body been found.

428
00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:36.959
Then covering the crime scene.

429
00:27:37.133 --> 00:27:38.918
realized that the phone and key
had been taken.

430
00:27:39.092 --> 00:27:40.267
sent Glenn over.

431
00:27:41.094 --> 00:27:42.269
Should have had him enter.

432
00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:43.836
Hindsight.

433
00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:46.665
They must have come here
right after killing him.

434
00:28:13.126 --> 00:28:15.128
Hello. Cassie Holt.

435
00:28:51.599 --> 00:28:53.122
So. this is the murder house?

436
00:28:54.036 --> 00:28:55.908
This is where
Mikeal was investigating?

437
00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.953
Yeah. this is it.

438
00:29:00.303 --> 00:29:02.392
John Abernathy.
So. what's his story?

439
00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:06.005
Oh. he's part of the remaining
old money in this area.

440
00:29:06.179 --> 00:29:08.659
Like most of them.
living on past family glory.

441
00:29:08.921 --> 00:29:11.358
Don't think he's ever worked
a day in his life.

442
00:29:11.532 --> 00:29:14.491
He's a widower. for a couple
of decades now. at least.

443
00:29:15.928 --> 00:29:17.190
What the hell is this?

444
00:29:20.019 --> 00:29:21.585
May I help you. sir?

445
00:29:23.022 --> 00:29:25.328
Yeah. I've come to show
my investigator the crime scene.

446
00:29:26.503 --> 00:29:27.983
Unfortunately.
that won't be possible.

447
00:29:28.723 --> 00:29:29.898
I'm sorry. say that again.

448
00:29:30.072 --> 00:29:32.031
We're unable to let you
into the house.

449
00:29:32.901 --> 00:29:36.513
Uh. Active murder investigation.
crime scene.

450
00:29:36.687 --> 00:29:38.341
Is any of this computing
with you. pal?

451
00:29:38.515 --> 00:29:40.430
The predicament
isn't lost on me. sir.

452
00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:42.302
But our instructions
were quite clear.

453
00:29:42.737 --> 00:29:44.130
No one enters without a warrant.

454
00:29:45.914 --> 00:29:48.482
- Do you have a warrant. sir?
- Who hired you?

455
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.006
I'm afraid
I'm not liberty to say. sir.

456
00:29:51.702 --> 00:29:53.704
Look. you're not getting in.

457
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:55.706
So. go ahead and go.

458
00:29:57.099 --> 00:29:59.145
Sir. I'm gonna tell
your buddy here

459
00:29:59.319 --> 00:30:00.711
to take his finger
off the trigger

460
00:30:00.886 --> 00:30:02.670
and render that weapon safe

461
00:30:02.975 --> 00:30:04.150
or it's gonna hurt

462
00:30:04.324 --> 00:30:06.021
coming back out of his ass.

463
00:30:09.242 --> 00:30:10.983
I will fucking murder you. bitch.

464
00:30:11.635 --> 00:30:14.987
She's a little excited.
so pay attention to me. closely.

465
00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.687
Now remove the gun.
drop the magazine.

466
00:30:19.861 --> 00:30:22.429
and rack the slide to clear it.
Do it now.

467
00:30:22.603 --> 00:30:23.647
Slow.

468
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:27.129
Your boy got anything else?

469
00:30:27.434 --> 00:30:29.088
No. just the rifle.

470
00:30:29.262 --> 00:30:30.872
Just a rifle. Okay. Yeah.

471
00:30:31.046 --> 00:30:32.047
Dipshits.

472
00:30:36.095 --> 00:30:38.706
At least you have an amount
of professional about you.

473
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:46.192
Ditch these two.

474
00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:47.584
or they're gonna
get you killed someday.

475
00:30:52.981 --> 00:30:55.592
And that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

476
00:30:55.766 --> 00:30:57.116
We're gonna go get a warrant.

477
00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:58.334
and we're gonna go
into this crime scene.

478
00:30:58.944 --> 00:31:00.293
We'll be back tomorrow morning.

479
00:31:01.033 --> 00:31:03.078
Alert who ever hired you.

480
00:31:11.957 --> 00:31:13.001
You hungry?

481
00:31:19.834 --> 00:31:21.270
- Thank you.
Thanks.

482
00:31:24.447 --> 00:31:28.190
"I'll fucking murder you.
bitch."?

483
00:31:28.756 --> 00:31:30.627
- It got his attention.
- That it did.

484
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.500
Are you actually gonna
get a warrant

485
00:31:33.674 --> 00:31:35.241
to go into a house
you have every right to enter?

486
00:31:35.632 --> 00:31:37.069
No. not at all.

487
00:31:38.331 --> 00:31:42.291
- You're gonna go in on your own.
- Good.

488
00:31:48.558 --> 00:31:50.865
So. what's it like
being a private investigator?

489
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.520
I never intended to be one.

490
00:31:54.347 --> 00:31:58.307
I was in the Interpol
for 26 years.

491
00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:01.702
retired and had other plans.
you know?

492
00:32:02.442 --> 00:32:03.443
Then...

493
00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:07.055
Ellie got sick. died. yeah.

494
00:32:09.753 --> 00:32:12.452
So. I knew if I didn't find
something to do.

495
00:32:12.626 --> 00:32:14.541
loneliness and boredom

496
00:32:15.194 --> 00:32:16.412
would take me out.

497
00:32:18.023 --> 00:32:21.156
So. I got the license.
started working. and...

498
00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.203
It's not terribly different

499
00:32:24.377 --> 00:32:26.248
than what I was doing before.
you know.

500
00:32:26.727 --> 00:32:29.860
Paper trails. interviews.
all that.

501
00:32:32.037 --> 00:32:33.125
What?

502
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:36.911
Get beat up in alleys.
bring down crooked governments.

503
00:32:37.085 --> 00:32:40.436
bad women with hearts of gold
and turbo hot bodies.

504
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.221
Yeah. sure. Yeah.

505
00:32:42.395 --> 00:32:44.397
I wish. Yeah. Yeah.

506
00:32:44.832 --> 00:32:47.704
I read all of those books
when I was growing up.

507
00:32:47.878 --> 00:32:52.361
you know. but... they're fun
and complete bullshit.

508
00:32:55.103 --> 00:32:56.931
- No.
Now. first of all.

509
00:32:57.584 --> 00:32:59.586
forget everything
you see in movies.

510
00:33:00.717 --> 00:33:03.503
The job is almost always boring.

511
00:33:04.547 --> 00:33:06.114
You sit up for hours.

512
00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:09.378
watching something
with binoculars.

513
00:33:10.814 --> 00:33:14.253
You get really good at peeing
in a bottle.

514
00:33:14.427 --> 00:33:17.169
Yeah. It's-- It is what it is.

515
00:33:17.343 --> 00:33:19.084
You know?

516
00:33:19.258 --> 00:33:23.088
Plus side. you-- you work when
you want or you need to. and...

517
00:33:23.262 --> 00:33:24.393
money is. uh...

518
00:33:25.394 --> 00:33:27.440
decent. So. yeah.

519
00:33:30.617 --> 00:33:32.010
That sounds perfect.

520
00:33:32.184 --> 00:33:33.446
Yeah.
- Sign me up.

521
00:33:39.234 --> 00:33:40.366
Are you serious?

522
00:33:41.454 --> 00:33:42.933
Well. I need a job

523
00:33:43.108 --> 00:33:44.761
and I'm good with searches.
data sheets and stuff.

524
00:33:44.935 --> 00:33:47.025
You know. I'm a trained
librarian. Remember?

525
00:33:54.554 --> 00:33:56.599
Okay. we-- we-- we--

526
00:33:56.773 --> 00:33:59.124
We-- we can talk about it
and try it out.

527
00:34:00.168 --> 00:34:01.691
'Cause you had me
at peeing in a bottle.

528
00:34:02.997 --> 00:34:04.651
It will be spectacular.

529
00:34:04.825 --> 00:34:07.610
I can't pee in a bottle.

530
00:34:12.876 --> 00:34:14.704
Okay. so the assholes
are outside.

531
00:34:14.878 --> 00:34:16.489
I'm guessing they're not
allowed in the house.

532
00:34:16.663 --> 00:34:17.968
<i>Would you let them?</i>

533
00:34:18.143 --> 00:34:19.318
Point.

534
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:21.885
So. I'm gonna swing
around the other side

535
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.062
and see if I can find
a place to go in.

536
00:34:27.717 --> 00:34:28.849
Oh. my God.

537
00:34:29.023 --> 00:34:31.852
That was close. Woo!

538
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:49.739
Okay.

539
00:34:51.001 --> 00:34:52.829
I'm gonna make a dash for it.
Wish me luck.

540
00:34:53.003 --> 00:34:54.092
<i>Good luck.</i>

541
00:34:55.615 --> 00:34:56.616
Fuck!

542
00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:12.936
Goddamn it.

543
00:35:13.459 --> 00:35:15.287
<i>What is it?</i>
- This one's locked as well.

544
00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:18.899
<i>Well. we can
call it off. Find another way.</i>

545
00:35:19.073 --> 00:35:20.596
No. let me see if I can
pick the lock.

546
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.163
If I learned
anything from Mikeal.

547
00:35:22.903 --> 00:35:24.905
this will be my virgin effort.

548
00:35:30.215 --> 00:35:31.694
- I'm in.
<i>Really?</i>

549
00:35:31.868 --> 00:35:32.869
<i>- That was quick.</i>
- That was quick. wasn't it?

550
00:35:38.571 --> 00:35:40.268
Everything looks as it should.

551
00:35:41.487 --> 00:35:43.402
It's like the Gardaí
were never here.

552
00:35:45.578 --> 00:35:47.406
Where was
old man Abernathy killed?

553
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.885
<i>Murder file says
upstairs.</i>

554
00:35:49.059 --> 00:35:50.626
<i>towards the end of the hall.</i>

555
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.933
- Going upstairs.
<i>Copy that.</i>

556
00:36:34.061 --> 00:36:36.063
Nothing unusual so far.

557
00:36:37.064 --> 00:36:39.762
<i>Like I suspected.
a complete whitewash.</i>

558
00:36:40.502 --> 00:36:42.504
<i>Investigators made the book
and got out.</i>

559
00:36:42.678 --> 00:36:44.811
<i>Old world money
trying to make this go away.</i>

560
00:37:14.971 --> 00:37:16.234
Strange.

561
00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:20.847
It looks like certain contents
have been removed.

562
00:37:21.674 --> 00:37:23.284
<i>What the hell?</i>

563
00:37:23.458 --> 00:37:24.938
<i>The file says nothing
was removed into evidence.</i>

564
00:37:25.112 --> 00:37:26.244
<i>except for the mattress.</i>

565
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.768
He was killed in bed. wasn't he?

566
00:37:28.942 --> 00:37:29.812
<i>Yeah.</i>

567
00:37:30.335 --> 00:37:32.032
Yeah. The bed's here.

568
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.646
No mattress. no box springs.

569
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.084
Isn't there a lot of blood
in the pictures?

570
00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:42.651
<i>Yeah. everywhere.</i>

571
00:37:43.652 --> 00:37:44.871
There's no more blood.

572
00:37:50.529 --> 00:37:52.531
It feels like the investigators
haven't done anything.

573
00:37:52.705 --> 00:37:54.359
This room should have been
thoroughly upturned.

574
00:37:54.533 --> 00:37:56.274
and it's like
it hasn't been touched.

575
00:38:00.495 --> 00:38:02.454
Did it say anything
about a hidden room?

576
00:38:03.455 --> 00:38:04.543
<i>There's not supposed to be</i>

577
00:38:04.717 --> 00:38:05.718
<i>any hidden rooms.</i>

578
00:38:06.936 --> 00:38:08.198
Stand by.

579
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.575
Fuck.

580
00:38:37.837 --> 00:38:38.838
<i>What is it?</i>

581
00:38:39.142 --> 00:38:40.187
<i>Are you okay?</i>

582
00:38:41.014 --> 00:38:43.886
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

583
00:38:45.497 --> 00:38:46.846
I'll send you a picture.

584
00:38:52.417 --> 00:38:54.201
Christ.

585
00:39:02.122 --> 00:39:04.429
That's where I'd sleep
when they brought me over here.

586
00:39:08.258 --> 00:39:09.303
Hang up.

587
00:39:09.564 --> 00:39:11.174
Hey. Bob. I'll. uh...

588
00:39:11.914 --> 00:39:13.612
I'll call you back
in a second. okay?

589
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.400
Glenn. grab Sam and Alex.

590
00:39:19.574 --> 00:39:21.228
we're heading
to the Abernathy house!

591
00:39:28.191 --> 00:39:29.367
Hey. Cassie Holt.

592
00:39:33.893 --> 00:39:35.677
It's pretty much soundproof
in there.

593
00:39:36.548 --> 00:39:37.984
You cry. you scream.

594
00:39:38.158 --> 00:39:40.116
it doesn't bother anybody else
in the house.

595
00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.728
I slept in there the night I
killed him for old times'’ sake.

596
00:39:42.902 --> 00:39:43.816
Who are you?

597
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:49.517
I'm Jamie.
What are you doing here?

598
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.390
The guys outside wouldn't let
the Detective Sergeant and I in

599
00:39:52.564 --> 00:39:53.826
to look around.

600
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.305
- You broke in.
Yeah.

601
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.655
That's not very legal.

602
00:40:01.486 --> 00:40:02.661
Did you kill Mikeal?

603
00:40:03.488 --> 00:40:05.011
I did.

604
00:40:05.838 --> 00:40:07.448
Yeah. I thought
he was working for them.

605
00:40:07.622 --> 00:40:08.971
It was before I knew more.

606
00:40:09.145 --> 00:40:10.538
I-- I've seen you
with the sergeant.

607
00:40:10.712 --> 00:40:14.194
like he was. looking for me.
instead of them.

608
00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.026
I may have been premature.

609
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.681
- You fucking think?
- Shh!

610
00:40:23.508 --> 00:40:24.422
Cassie Holt.

611
00:40:25.814 --> 00:40:27.729
We don't need them
in here right now.

612
00:40:28.817 --> 00:40:29.775
So...

613
00:40:30.732 --> 00:40:31.690
that Tallini guy...

614
00:40:32.952 --> 00:40:33.866
He your boyfriend?

615
00:40:34.867 --> 00:40:35.998
- Husband?
- No.

616
00:40:38.523 --> 00:40:39.872
No. no. Nothing like that.

617
00:40:40.046 --> 00:40:42.091
He helped me
out of a bad stretch and...

618
00:40:42.962 --> 00:40:44.442
Well. he gave me a purpose.

619
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.313
And a few days ago
I let him down.

620
00:40:46.487 --> 00:40:47.836
so now I'm looking for you.

621
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:50.535
In actual fact.
if you want to know.

622
00:40:50.709 --> 00:40:53.059
he's the only man I've ever met
who didn't try to fuck me.

623
00:40:55.627 --> 00:40:57.106
I don't know what that's like.

624
00:40:58.499 --> 00:40:59.544
Hmm.

625
00:41:00.719 --> 00:41:02.111
I'm sorry about your friend.

626
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.245
I'm gonna kill you.

627
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.379
I can't be mad at that.

628
00:41:14.036 --> 00:41:16.256
We're alike. you and I.

629
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:19.999
Like hell we are.

630
00:41:20.739 --> 00:41:22.175
No. not that.

631
00:41:23.002 --> 00:41:24.743
Someone did
something to us that--

632
00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.713
Disarm
and detain these men.

633
00:41:41.324 --> 00:41:43.501
You called for help.
You sneaky...

634
00:41:45.677 --> 00:41:46.504
Cassie!

635
00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.245
Cassie!

636
00:41:52.597 --> 00:41:54.860
Okay. Jamie Elizabeth Douglas.

637
00:41:55.034 --> 00:41:57.863
January 11th. '94. Look me up.

638
00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:06.654
- Fuck me.
- What happened?

639
00:42:06.959 --> 00:42:08.395
- It's a girl.
- What? Who is?

640
00:42:08.569 --> 00:42:10.049
Mikeal's killer.
killed Abernathy.

641
00:42:10.223 --> 00:42:11.485
It's a goddamn girl.
She just admitted it to me.

642
00:42:11.659 --> 00:42:13.139
What? Okay. right.
Just calm down.

643
00:42:13.313 --> 00:42:14.706
Look at me. Look at me.
Now what did she look like?

644
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.098
I couldn't really see her.
She was 5'6".

645
00:42:16.272 --> 00:42:17.926
She had a hoodie. brown hair.

646
00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.406
<i>Rest of the house is clear.</i>

647
00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.103
All right. Just stay down there.
No one comes in.

648
00:42:21.277 --> 00:42:22.757
She said. "You could be in there
crying and screaming.

649
00:42:22.931 --> 00:42:24.367
and you wouldn't bother
anyone else in the house."

650
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:25.717
What happened with her
and Abernathy? I mean. I know--

651
00:42:25.891 --> 00:42:27.283
- She knew who I was!
- What?

652
00:42:27.457 --> 00:42:28.850
<i>Victor Harrison's out here.</i>

653
00:42:29.024 --> 00:42:30.330
<i>- raising holy hell.</i>
- Of course he is.

654
00:42:30.504 --> 00:42:32.027
Just keep him there!
I'll be right down.

655
00:42:32.201 --> 00:42:34.160
All right. photograph every inch
of this sick shit.

656
00:42:34.334 --> 00:42:35.814
- You have two minutes.
- Yeah.

657
00:42:40.209 --> 00:42:42.168
Mr. Harrison. as I've stated.

658
00:42:42.342 --> 00:42:44.518
you will not be entering
at this time.

659
00:42:44.692 --> 00:42:47.913
McMahon. What the fuck
are you doing in my house?

660
00:42:48.087 --> 00:42:50.219
We received a call
from a concerned citizen

661
00:42:50.393 --> 00:42:52.134
about men with guns.

662
00:42:52.308 --> 00:42:54.310
So. we detain them
to ascertain why they were here

663
00:42:54.484 --> 00:42:55.877
and why they were armed.

664
00:42:56.051 --> 00:42:57.357
Further investigation.
we discovered that

665
00:42:57.531 --> 00:42:59.751
- the back door was open.
- Men with guns?

666
00:43:01.013 --> 00:43:04.190
Well. I don't care
if the whole fucking place

667
00:43:04.364 --> 00:43:06.584
is lit up like a Christmas tree

668
00:43:06.845 --> 00:43:08.847
and every door
and window is open.

669
00:43:09.717 --> 00:43:12.285
You've no business
inside my house.

670
00:43:12.459 --> 00:43:13.547
Your house?

671
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:15.854
I thought this was
John Abernathy's home.

672
00:43:16.028 --> 00:43:17.812
been in his family
a few generations.

673
00:43:17.986 --> 00:43:19.422
Well. he died and left it to me.

674
00:43:19.814 --> 00:43:21.686
Anyway. it's none
of your goddamn business.

675
00:43:23.296 --> 00:43:24.645
Mr. Harrison.

676
00:43:24.993 --> 00:43:27.692
you will address me
as Detective Sergeant. sir.

677
00:43:27.866 --> 00:43:29.128
or not at all.

678
00:43:30.042 --> 00:43:31.391
Are we understood on that?

679
00:43:32.958 --> 00:43:36.483
Uh. Well. I. I apologize. sir.

680
00:43:37.745 --> 00:43:40.008
It's been
a very stressful time. sir.

681
00:43:41.009 --> 00:43:43.708
I miss my fucking friend. sir.

682
00:43:44.447 --> 00:43:45.492
I understand.

683
00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.930
I'll be back down
to get them out shortly.

684
00:43:49.104 --> 00:43:51.237
- just so you know.
- Oh. they're not under arrest.

685
00:43:51.411 --> 00:43:52.717
No. we're just gonna
have a little chat.

686
00:43:52.891 --> 00:43:54.370
but I have a feeling one of 'em

687
00:43:54.544 --> 00:43:56.634
- is gonna sing like a bird.
- Do you. now?

688
00:43:59.245 --> 00:44:00.159
Mr. Harrison?

689
00:44:00.333 --> 00:44:01.421
Yes.

690
00:44:03.684 --> 00:44:05.468
Jamie Douglas sends her regards.

691
00:44:08.341 --> 00:44:10.082
Well. I don't know who that is.

692
00:44:21.876 --> 00:44:23.486
Well. how about that.

693
00:44:28.187 --> 00:44:29.231
So...

694
00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:32.713
the guy who messed with you.

695
00:44:32.887 --> 00:44:35.107
- he was your--
- Step-grandfather.

696
00:44:35.847 --> 00:44:37.587
Yeah. Right. Let me guess.

697
00:44:38.414 --> 00:44:42.375
As far as everyone was
concerned. a great guy. right?

698
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:44.377
-  Pretty much.
Yeah.

699
00:44:47.206 --> 00:44:50.252
That's the...
the predator's strength.

700
00:44:50.949 --> 00:44:52.211
his camouflage.

701
00:44:53.168 --> 00:44:57.738
The drooling. howl at the moon.
crazy predator exist.

702
00:44:57.912 --> 00:45:00.436
but you know. they are rare.

703
00:45:01.873 --> 00:45:03.788
This one makes the news.

704
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:07.748
But these look like...

705
00:45:08.967 --> 00:45:10.577
everyone else out there.

706
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.712
But they're missing the thing

707
00:45:14.886 --> 00:45:16.670
that make human beings human.

708
00:45:18.411 --> 00:45:19.412
Empathy.

709
00:45:24.634 --> 00:45:25.984
It started when I was eight.

710
00:45:36.298 --> 00:45:38.866
And it lasted all the way
till I went to university.

711
00:45:39.301 --> 00:45:40.476
which is a long time.

712
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.436
And I was there a year.

713
00:45:44.176 --> 00:45:46.265
And as well as school.

714
00:45:46.439 --> 00:45:49.137
I learned to
take care of myself.

715
00:45:50.008 --> 00:45:52.227
uh. ju-jitsu and Krav Maga.

716
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:55.143
at the same time. daily.

717
00:45:55.361 --> 00:45:56.536
So I was sore.

718
00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.279
No. I was fucking sore.

719
00:46:09.723 --> 00:46:11.290
Not a victim anymore.

720
00:46:11.464 --> 00:46:12.770
No. never again.

721
00:46:16.512 --> 00:46:17.731
After a year.

722
00:46:18.514 --> 00:46:21.039
I came home for Christmas and...

723
00:46:21.996 --> 00:46:23.258
that night

724
00:46:23.868 --> 00:46:26.261
sure as shit.
he was at my door. drunk...

725
00:46:27.045 --> 00:46:28.220
<i>"Hey. baby."</i>

726
00:46:33.399 --> 00:46:35.009
And he reaches for me...

727
00:46:37.664 --> 00:46:40.058
And... arm bar.

728
00:46:41.015 --> 00:46:43.278
like hyper-extended it.
twisted it with my left hand

729
00:46:43.452 --> 00:46:45.715
and broke his fucking elbow
with my left hand.

730
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:47.979
and the sound
of that bone breaking

731
00:46:48.153 --> 00:46:49.502
was so fucking glorious.

732
00:46:49.676 --> 00:46:52.374
I can't tell you
how fucking glorious it was.

733
00:46:57.902 --> 00:47:00.078
I wanted to break
every fucking bone in his body.

734
00:47:00.252 --> 00:47:01.383
but I didn't.

735
00:47:04.517 --> 00:47:05.387
Yeah.

736
00:47:06.432 --> 00:47:07.476
You didn't.

737
00:47:11.176 --> 00:47:12.830
You didn't let the monster win.

738
00:47:14.266 --> 00:47:15.180
No.

739
00:47:16.442 --> 00:47:17.835
You stayed a human being.

740
00:47:18.748 --> 00:47:20.054
You protected yourself.

741
00:47:21.403 --> 00:47:23.536
When the threat was over.
you stopped.

742
00:47:26.408 --> 00:47:27.627
What happened then?

743
00:47:30.456 --> 00:47:31.457
He went away.

744
00:47:32.937 --> 00:47:34.808
And my family abandoned me.

745
00:47:34.982 --> 00:47:36.679
even after
they'd seen the evidence.

746
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.117
Meaning the videos. right?

747
00:47:39.291 --> 00:47:41.293
Yeah. so they're dead to me.

748
00:47:45.079 --> 00:47:48.082
You know. just because
they're related to you.

749
00:47:48.996 --> 00:47:50.693
doesn't mean
you have to like them.

750
00:47:53.827 --> 00:47:55.394
You make your own family. right?

751
00:48:01.748 --> 00:48:02.749
<i>Jamie?</i>

752
00:48:03.837 --> 00:48:05.360
I don't remember who that is.

753
00:48:06.144 --> 00:48:08.494
She was the one
who stayed with us the longest.

754
00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:12.280
See if that jogs your memory.

755
00:48:14.587 --> 00:48:15.588
Oh.

756
00:48:16.545 --> 00:48:17.807
The screamer.

757
00:48:18.852 --> 00:48:20.854
She stole from us when she left.

758
00:48:21.768 --> 00:48:23.161
Marty left things unattended.

759
00:48:23.335 --> 00:48:25.206
That brings up
an excellent question.

760
00:48:26.599 --> 00:48:27.817
Where is Marty?

761
00:49:17.215 --> 00:49:18.520
You stole his phone.

762
00:49:20.044 --> 00:49:21.349
Hey. Cassie Holt.

763
00:49:22.263 --> 00:49:24.483
Hello. Jamie.
What are you doing?

764
00:49:25.223 --> 00:49:26.311
Oh. you know.

765
00:49:28.182 --> 00:49:29.879
This is exciting.

766
00:49:31.055 --> 00:49:33.405
The private investigator
talking to the murder suspect.

767
00:49:33.579 --> 00:49:35.668
Well. I mean.
you're not exactly a suspect.

768
00:49:36.277 --> 00:49:38.192
I guess not.

769
00:49:38.627 --> 00:49:39.628
And here you are.

770
00:49:40.934 --> 00:49:42.414
So. let me tell you
a little story.

771
00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:45.243
When I was 14.

772
00:49:46.113 --> 00:49:49.073
my mother's boyfriend
did stuff to me...

773
00:49:50.074 --> 00:49:51.162
he shouldn't have.

774
00:49:51.901 --> 00:49:54.730
And when I told dear old Mom.
she hit me.

775
00:49:54.904 --> 00:49:56.950
Right. Mine too.

776
00:49:58.082 --> 00:50:01.650
She told me I was horrible
and let it continue.

777
00:50:02.434 --> 00:50:04.262
So. I never mentioned it again.

778
00:50:06.438 --> 00:50:07.439
I thought so.

779
00:50:08.614 --> 00:50:10.659
Those of us with secrets.
we can tell.

780
00:50:11.921 --> 00:50:13.053
So. what happened?

781
00:50:15.708 --> 00:50:17.318
Oh. I ran away.

782
00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:20.930
Slummed it on the streets
of New York as a teenager.

783
00:50:22.323 --> 00:50:25.152
Eventually got myself
to London. and...

784
00:50:25.587 --> 00:50:27.850
wound up begging
on the streets in Dublin.

785
00:50:30.375 --> 00:50:31.463
This lady comes up.

786
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.596
She's... older.

787
00:50:35.293 --> 00:50:38.035
pretty. and offers
to buy me food.

788
00:50:39.688 --> 00:50:40.776
But then we talk.

789
00:50:42.126 --> 00:50:43.910
Okay. That's different.

790
00:50:46.565 --> 00:50:48.132
And I'm hungry so...

791
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:52.397
<i>She was the worst of them
in their dirty little club.</i>

792
00:50:55.878 --> 00:50:57.880
Well. I've invited Wallace here.

793
00:50:58.055 --> 00:50:59.404
I wondered why she was here.

794
00:50:59.578 --> 00:51:01.493
She's not even
supposed to be here.

795
00:51:01.667 --> 00:51:03.712
I'm here for the reason
that I usually am.

796
00:51:03.886 --> 00:51:05.192
to clean up your shit.

797
00:51:06.019 --> 00:51:07.455
That was an accident.

798
00:51:09.153 --> 00:51:10.197
So...

799
00:51:10.763 --> 00:51:13.026
what do you suggest we do
in this situation?

800
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.289
Wallace and I
have discussed it. and...

801
00:51:15.463 --> 00:51:17.509
we think it's best
if we all just leave.

802
00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:19.076
Leave?

803
00:51:19.946 --> 00:51:21.252
I'm not leaving.

804
00:51:22.035 --> 00:51:23.558
And neither should anyone else.

805
00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:27.040
We built this entire part
of the country.

806
00:51:27.214 --> 00:51:29.347
Actually. your grandfathers
and your great-grandfathers

807
00:51:29.521 --> 00:51:31.349
built this part of the country.

808
00:51:31.523 --> 00:51:32.915
Listen. we've discussed it.

809
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:37.050
and I agree. I think
we should all just go away.

810
00:51:37.877 --> 00:51:39.139
until she's caught

811
00:51:39.792 --> 00:51:40.836
or killed.

812
00:51:42.447 --> 00:51:43.970
Could we just kill them both?

813
00:51:47.104 --> 00:51:48.279
Kill them both?

814
00:51:49.018 --> 00:51:50.324
From what you say.

815
00:51:50.498 --> 00:51:52.109
they're obviously
working together.

816
00:51:53.153 --> 00:51:54.546
Maybe even that first one.

817
00:51:55.329 --> 00:51:56.591
Except Jamie gutted him.

818
00:51:58.202 --> 00:52:00.073
She's obviously deranged.

819
00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:02.249
Well. it's...

820
00:52:02.989 --> 00:52:05.905
it's possible the Holt girl
could be convinced

821
00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:07.559
to drop the case.

822
00:52:08.342 --> 00:52:09.822
Boys you hired.

823
00:52:09.996 --> 00:52:11.693
put the fear of God in her. yeah?

824
00:52:12.085 --> 00:52:13.130
But Jamie...

825
00:52:14.653 --> 00:52:15.784
I think we...

826
00:52:16.481 --> 00:52:19.179
we can all agree
she should just go away.

827
00:52:21.007 --> 00:52:22.487
I mean. Jesus Christ.

828
00:52:23.052 --> 00:52:25.794
fallout from what she knows. catastrophic.

829
00:52:26.665 --> 00:52:27.579
And...

830
00:52:29.798 --> 00:52:31.539
she did draw first blood.

831
00:52:31.713 --> 00:52:32.888
She what?

832
00:52:34.803 --> 00:52:36.979
You guys both own
this playhouse here

833
00:52:37.154 --> 00:52:38.546
and she drew the first blood?

834
00:52:43.377 --> 00:52:47.686
Somewhere during the meal.

835
00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:50.428
- I'm getting sleepy...
Roofies.

836
00:52:53.039 --> 00:52:54.606
I woke up in a cage.

837
00:52:55.476 --> 00:52:57.957
And I didn't wear clothes
for the next five years.

838
00:52:58.131 --> 00:52:59.393
Oh. my God.

839
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:02.527
I don't really believe in God.

840
00:53:02.701 --> 00:53:03.528
No.

841
00:53:05.834 --> 00:53:07.184
No. I understand.

842
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:12.711
Do you. believe in God?

843
00:53:15.627 --> 00:53:16.715
Um...

844
00:53:18.369 --> 00:53:20.414
Yeah. I can't. actually.

845
00:53:21.067 --> 00:53:24.462
So. we all agree that the boys
should scare the Holt girl

846
00:53:24.636 --> 00:53:25.811
to convince her to leave town.

847
00:53:28.117 --> 00:53:29.510
Okay. I'll tell them.

848
00:53:30.903 --> 00:53:32.687
They're gonna need a little bit
more for this though.

849
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:34.559
Edgar.

850
00:53:36.082 --> 00:53:37.388
Yeah. that's fine.

851
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:39.128
Just get her out here.

852
00:53:43.872 --> 00:53:45.047
I'm so bored.

853
00:53:46.788 --> 00:53:48.573
We need something to play with.

854
00:53:52.272 --> 00:53:55.406
I understand
your need to get revenge.

855
00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.886
Believe me. I do get it.

856
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:01.455
But you don't have to kill them.

857
00:54:02.326 --> 00:54:04.328
If you let us put them away.

858
00:54:05.633 --> 00:54:07.940
you can let them
be scared for a change.

859
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.944
They're scared now. Cassie Holt.

860
00:54:12.466 --> 00:54:14.468
I know.
but you've let the monster win.

861
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:17.471
No.

862
00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.517
I chose to be a monster.

863
00:54:23.608 --> 00:54:24.478
They're vile.

864
00:54:26.175 --> 00:54:27.351
And horrible.

865
00:54:28.352 --> 00:54:29.918
The wife is the worst.

866
00:54:30.658 --> 00:54:33.531
The husband is weaker.
in comparison to her.

867
00:54:33.705 --> 00:54:34.923
He likes choking.

868
00:54:35.576 --> 00:54:37.839
They all tease him
for accidentally killing

869
00:54:38.013 --> 00:54:39.058
a little boy.

870
00:54:39.798 --> 00:54:40.625
Tease.

871
00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.975
The solicitor...

872
00:54:43.541 --> 00:54:45.194
He's just a sleaze.

873
00:54:46.108 --> 00:54:46.979
Harrison?

874
00:54:48.633 --> 00:54:50.069
And so were the other two.

875
00:54:51.984 --> 00:54:53.681
Sorry. wait a second.
the other two?

876
00:54:53.855 --> 00:54:57.468
Oh. See? That's what they call
a plot twist. Cassie Holt.

877
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.431
I will talk to you later.
I gotta go do some monster shit.

878
00:55:24.625 --> 00:55:26.758
What's up? You sounded frantic
on the phone.

879
00:55:26.932 --> 00:55:28.412
She's done it again.
She's killed another one.

880
00:55:28.586 --> 00:55:30.457
She has? Who is it? Where?

881
00:55:30.762 --> 00:55:32.329
I don't know.

882
00:55:32.503 --> 00:55:34.418
- Then how do you know?
- She called me? She told me.

883
00:55:34.592 --> 00:55:36.376
- She called?
- Yeah. on Mikeal's phone.

884
00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:38.335
At Abernathy's house.
she said keep your phone on.

885
00:55:38.509 --> 00:55:39.901
so I did and she called.

886
00:55:40.075 --> 00:55:41.338
Do you think
you might have mentioned this?

887
00:55:42.382 --> 00:55:44.645
I'm telling you now. She told me
she killed another one.

888
00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:47.953
All right. Okay. Okay. okay.
Just take a deep breath and...

889
00:55:48.127 --> 00:55:50.129
- ...tell me about the call.

890
00:55:53.567 --> 00:55:56.004
- Sick little clubhouse.
Hmm.

891
00:55:56.962 --> 00:55:59.834
And did she give any indication
as to where or what that is?

892
00:56:00.008 --> 00:56:02.141
No. she mentioned it like that
though.

893
00:56:03.316 --> 00:56:05.013
They have companies everywhere.

894
00:56:05.231 --> 00:56:06.363
Together or otherwise.

895
00:56:07.364 --> 00:56:08.756
Maybe look into holdings.

896
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:10.149
property taxes.

897
00:56:10.323 --> 00:56:11.716
- Yeah.
- Their companies and others.

898
00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:13.413
find a connection between them.

899
00:56:15.284 --> 00:56:17.722
Do you really think that
she killed another one of them

900
00:56:17.896 --> 00:56:19.593
or is she full of shit?

901
00:56:19.767 --> 00:56:21.290
Oh. no. I think she did it.
She was delighted to tell me

902
00:56:21.465 --> 00:56:23.205
and she tried to make it sound
like it was a slip.

903
00:56:25.294 --> 00:56:26.383
Tell you what.

904
00:56:27.427 --> 00:56:28.950
Let's stir the pot a little.

905
00:56:33.955 --> 00:56:35.609
We need another plaything.

906
00:56:37.132 --> 00:56:38.090
No. Dottie.

907
00:56:38.264 --> 00:56:39.961
No. not now.

908
00:56:40.484 --> 00:56:42.311
Not for a good long while.

909
00:56:43.008 --> 00:56:45.227
- Whatever.

910
00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:48.056
Ah. hell. I'm sorry.

911
00:56:50.363 --> 00:56:51.843
What now. McMahon?

912
00:56:52.452 --> 00:56:55.020
Have you done a headcount
on all your surviving buddies?

913
00:56:55.194 --> 00:56:56.195
Anyone missing?

914
00:56:58.284 --> 00:57:00.634
Haven't heard from Marty
in a while. Why do you ask?

915
00:57:00.808 --> 00:57:03.463
What the fuck!?

916
00:57:08.686 --> 00:57:09.643
<i>Victor?</i>

917
00:57:10.165 --> 00:57:11.166
Victor?!

918
00:57:15.954 --> 00:57:18.304
Something freaked him
the fuck out there.

919
00:57:19.218 --> 00:57:21.873
I think I have an idea
of what that might be.

920
00:57:41.719 --> 00:57:43.198
Hello. Cassie Holt.

921
00:57:47.072 --> 00:57:48.377
What did you just do?

922
00:57:48.552 --> 00:57:49.596
I told you.

923
00:57:50.249 --> 00:57:51.424
Monster shit.

924
00:57:51.903 --> 00:57:53.078
Monster shit.

925
00:57:54.122 --> 00:57:55.428
How'd you know?

926
00:57:55.602 --> 00:57:56.995
We were on the phone
with the solicitor

927
00:57:57.169 --> 00:57:58.387
when something happened.

928
00:57:58.562 --> 00:58:01.086
- We?
- The Detective Sergeant and I.

929
00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.609
Ah.

930
00:58:03.915 --> 00:58:05.786
- I'm on speaker?
- Yeah.

931
00:58:07.353 --> 00:58:08.789
Hi. Detective Sergeant.

932
00:58:09.442 --> 00:58:11.139
Quite the investigator
you got here.

933
00:58:13.359 --> 00:58:16.667
You would make both our jobs
easier if you'd just come in

934
00:58:16.841 --> 00:58:18.756
and we could
put them away together.

935
00:58:19.365 --> 00:58:21.236
Well. I'm not exactly
what they'd call

936
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:22.499
a sympathetic witness.

937
00:58:22.673 --> 00:58:23.804
Maybe not.

938
00:58:24.936 --> 00:58:27.547
But bad people
did bad things to you

939
00:58:27.721 --> 00:58:29.331
and they need to be punished.

940
00:58:30.376 --> 00:58:31.638
They're being punished.

941
00:58:33.031 --> 00:58:34.032
Jamie...

942
00:58:35.163 --> 00:58:36.164
come in.

943
00:58:37.296 --> 00:58:38.427
We can do it.

944
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:40.604
It's sweet you think so.

945
00:58:40.778 --> 00:58:42.301
- Gotta go.
- Wait. wait.

946
00:58:42.475 --> 00:58:44.129
before you leave.
just tell us about this place.

947
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:46.827
- The playhouse?
- Yeah.

948
00:58:47.001 --> 00:58:49.526
Yeah. Okay.
Well. that's what they call it.

949
00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:54.705
You can find it. Cassie Holt.
I have faith in you.

950
00:58:54.879 --> 00:58:58.056
Ooh. Look for Wallace.
works for the solicitor.

951
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:59.623
takes care of problems.

952
00:59:00.014 --> 00:59:01.538
<i>All right.
I'm actually gonna go now.</i>

953
00:59:02.321 --> 00:59:03.322
I'll be around.

954
00:59:14.899 --> 00:59:16.857
Over the years
I've seen criminals fixate

955
00:59:17.031 --> 00:59:19.164
on their pursuers
for any number of reasons.

956
00:59:19.338 --> 00:59:20.731
They think they're best friends.

957
00:59:20.905 --> 00:59:23.124
or they think
they're Holmes and Moriarty.

958
00:59:24.038 --> 00:59:25.387
The way you two have gone on.

959
00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:27.825
it's just the most bizarre thing
I've ever seen.

960
00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:29.304
Hm.

961
00:59:30.305 --> 00:59:33.091
She must recognize
a shared experience.

962
00:59:33.265 --> 00:59:35.920
although. I've never been
through anything like she had.

963
00:59:37.443 --> 00:59:39.837
I'm sure Mikeal
told you about that stuff.

964
00:59:40.011 --> 00:59:41.534
No. No. not at all.

965
00:59:42.187 --> 00:59:44.276
He would never
share things like that.

966
00:59:45.712 --> 00:59:48.715
I just had a feeling that
there's something in your past.

967
00:59:49.455 --> 00:59:51.239
You know. hunches. signs.

968
00:59:51.892 --> 00:59:52.937
Signs?

969
00:59:54.503 --> 00:59:55.592
I have signs?

970
00:59:57.681 --> 00:59:58.682
That's a bummer.

971
01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:05.036
I had a handle on the drinking
till the bastard called.

972
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:06.254
Who called?

973
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:08.648
Your abuser.

974
01:00:11.303 --> 01:00:15.002
You know. "I'm sorry"
and "I didn't mean to hurt you."

975
01:00:15.916 --> 01:00:18.527
And then. he said "baby doll."

976
01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:20.051
which is what he said during.

977
01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:22.053
and I just lost it.
you know. I hung up

978
01:00:22.227 --> 01:00:24.098
and walked straight
into a bottle.

979
01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:25.709
which is where you found me.

980
01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:28.189
halfway into letting
Mikeal down.

981
01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:32.150
- No. no. you didn't.
- Sorry. I'm freezing. I just...

982
01:00:35.022 --> 01:00:36.850
Just got a real shiver.

983
01:00:38.939 --> 01:00:40.724
The thing is.
if I saw this girl's story

984
01:00:40.898 --> 01:00:42.247
in an article or in a movie.

985
01:00:43.074 --> 01:00:45.076
I would've been
fully supportive of it.

986
01:00:45.946 --> 01:00:48.775
Believe me.
I understand the desire.

987
01:00:49.907 --> 01:00:51.822
If she hadn't killed Mikeal.
I would not care.

988
01:00:51.996 --> 01:00:53.127
But she did.

989
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:54.999
Yes. so for that.
we'll catch her.

990
01:00:56.087 --> 01:00:58.132
But the other side.
that's your end.

991
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.222
I understand fighting
the monster.

992
01:01:01.396 --> 01:01:04.312
I did it and I won.
but it's way tempting.

993
01:01:04.878 --> 01:01:05.705
What?

994
01:01:06.924 --> 01:01:08.403
That's Mikeal.

995
01:01:09.622 --> 01:01:11.145
We talked
about the monsters and...

996
01:01:11.929 --> 01:01:13.321
how they get inside you.

997
01:01:14.496 --> 01:01:15.672
He was a good teacher.

998
01:01:16.324 --> 01:01:18.631
Yeah. He was.

999
01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.942
I'm gonna head back
to the office.

1000
01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:26.465
Do you need a lift?

1001
01:01:26.639 --> 01:01:28.293
Oh. no. I'm fine.
My car's in the back.

1002
01:01:29.033 --> 01:01:30.948
I'm gonna stay
and do some research.

1003
01:01:31.949 --> 01:01:34.647
see if I can find anything
on Wallace and the playhouse.

1004
01:01:35.735 --> 01:01:39.608
Okay. so here's my logins
for the databases.

1005
01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:43.612
If I were able
to find information

1006
01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:45.571
through what might be called...

1007
01:01:46.964 --> 01:01:49.706
- extralegal means.
- Hacking?

1008
01:01:50.097 --> 01:01:51.055
Yeah.

1009
01:01:51.229 --> 01:01:53.274
Well. it wouldn't be admissible.

1010
01:01:53.448 --> 01:01:56.451
but if it steers us
to something that could be...

1011
01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:20.040
All right.
Victor Harrison. Esquire.

1012
01:03:19.578 --> 01:03:21.754
Jesus.

1013
01:03:22.059 --> 01:03:24.496
You people and your passwords.

1014
01:03:28.761 --> 01:03:29.980
Idiots.

1015
01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:44.081
Wallace is on the payroll...

1016
01:03:45.082 --> 01:03:47.214
for quite the hefty sum.

1017
01:04:05.972 --> 01:04:09.019
Playhouse.
Proprietor of Wallace.

1018
01:04:40.398 --> 01:04:41.660
So. what did you learn?

1019
01:04:41.834 --> 01:04:43.357
I learned I suck.

1020
01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:46.230
Well. everyone sucks
at first. You know?

1021
01:04:46.795 --> 01:04:49.755
Not getting discouraged is...
that's the trick. all right?

1022
01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:50.843
Yeah.

1023
01:04:51.017 --> 01:04:52.889
Now when you started jiujitsu...

1024
01:04:54.325 --> 01:04:55.848
- I sucked.
- Yeah. But now?

1025
01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:57.676
- Well. I don't suck.
- Yeah.

1026
01:04:58.503 --> 01:04:59.591
Let's go again.

1027
01:04:59.765 --> 01:05:00.635
Now remember.

1028
01:05:00.809 --> 01:05:02.637
slow is smooth.

1029
01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:04.988
Smooth is fast.

1030
01:05:05.162 --> 01:05:06.293
Correct. Go.

1031
01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:09.862
Yeah. Open.

1032
01:05:10.036 --> 01:05:12.560
Boom. Hey... Slow. slow.

1033
01:05:12.734 --> 01:05:14.911
Here you go.
And now change. Here you go.

1034
01:05:15.563 --> 01:05:16.608
One. Two.

1035
01:05:41.633 --> 01:05:43.461
Help me. man. Help me!

1036
01:05:46.681 --> 01:05:47.987
We're only supposed
to scare you.

1037
01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:59.433
If I don't kill you. it won't be
because I didn't try to.

1038
01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:15.188
Oh. shit.

1039
01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:20.210
Your dreams and mind should
fight it out to see who's worse.

1040
01:07:29.697 --> 01:07:32.048
You were doing great
until he kicked you in the twat.

1041
01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:38.097
"Thank you. Jamie.
I'm glad I'm not dead."

1042
01:07:41.013 --> 01:07:42.014
Yeah.

1043
01:07:43.363 --> 01:07:45.365
I'd much rather them dead
than me.

1044
01:07:46.279 --> 01:07:47.367
Thank you.

1045
01:07:50.718 --> 01:07:51.980
Why am I tied up?

1046
01:07:54.374 --> 01:07:56.333
Some people are grumpy
when they wake up.

1047
01:08:03.818 --> 01:08:05.646
Fuck.

1048
01:08:06.343 --> 01:08:08.606
Well. that's badass.

1049
01:08:13.132 --> 01:08:15.656
Oh. fuck.

1050
01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:24.187
Where's all my stuff?

1051
01:08:26.276 --> 01:08:27.451
It's in here.

1052
01:08:28.234 --> 01:08:30.889
And if you suddenly have to go.
I won't believe you.

1053
01:08:34.022 --> 01:08:35.111
When does this end?

1054
01:08:36.199 --> 01:08:37.722
When I've done them all.

1055
01:08:37.896 --> 01:08:39.245
And then what?

1056
01:08:39.419 --> 01:08:41.204
What else
do I have to live for?

1057
01:08:41.378 --> 01:08:43.162
They've ruined me
for anything normal.

1058
01:08:45.382 --> 01:08:47.384
It doesn't actually have
to be like this. you know.

1059
01:08:47.558 --> 01:08:49.647
because McMahon and I
can build a case.

1060
01:08:50.474 --> 01:08:51.562
One of them will flip.

1061
01:08:51.736 --> 01:08:53.303
One of them always flips.

1062
01:08:54.826 --> 01:08:56.958
That Wallace lady. the. uh...

1063
01:08:57.263 --> 01:08:59.004
troubleshooter
for the solicitor.

1064
01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:01.876
I've done some research on her
and the playhouse

1065
01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:04.357
is owned by a company she runs.

1066
01:09:04.836 --> 01:09:06.011
I knew you'd find it.

1067
01:09:07.491 --> 01:09:08.796
But she doesn't own it.

1068
01:09:09.449 --> 01:09:11.756
They've got something on her.
I don't know what.

1069
01:09:12.713 --> 01:09:14.150
She never participated.

1070
01:09:14.976 --> 01:09:16.152
At least not with me.

1071
01:09:16.761 --> 01:09:18.632
She might be hard to find now.

1072
01:09:19.416 --> 01:09:21.157
but don't worry.
I didn't kill her.

1073
01:09:21.331 --> 01:09:22.723
There was no reason to.

1074
01:09:24.116 --> 01:09:25.552
We just talked.

1075
01:09:41.786 --> 01:09:43.440
What the hell...?

1076
01:09:43.614 --> 01:09:44.789
What. you crazy bitch?!

1077
01:09:44.963 --> 01:09:46.486
Is that petrol?

1078
01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:49.228
Crazy people
really hate being called crazy.

1079
01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:52.623
- You remember me?

1080
01:09:54.059 --> 01:09:55.713
Do you know how petrol works?

1081
01:09:55.887 --> 01:09:56.931
Sparks and fumes.

1082
01:09:57.236 --> 01:09:59.282
Yeah. you would burn too.

1083
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:03.199
Okay.

1084
01:10:04.983 --> 01:10:06.202
Okay. Be cool.

1085
01:10:07.115 --> 01:10:08.682
I'm gonna put this down.

1086
01:10:08.856 --> 01:10:12.643
- Mm. I prefer the back seat.
- Okay. back seat it is.

1087
01:10:16.081 --> 01:10:17.213
Good job.

1088
01:10:18.126 --> 01:10:20.477
Now. there are some items

1089
01:10:20.651 --> 01:10:23.219
I'm looking for
and I have some questions.

1090
01:10:24.089 --> 01:10:25.221
You're gonna answer 'em.

1091
01:10:25.395 --> 01:10:26.787
If I don't like your answers...

1092
01:10:28.572 --> 01:10:29.529
I cook us.

1093
01:10:30.356 --> 01:10:31.966
If I'm happy with your answers.

1094
01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.752
you leave and you stop
hanging out with nasty people.

1095
01:10:35.274 --> 01:10:36.275
Nod.

1096
01:10:42.847 --> 01:10:44.370
You're a piece of shit.

1097
01:10:44.718 --> 01:10:47.025
but you're a piece of shit
that didn't do anything to me.

1098
01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:49.593
so I'm giving you
a second chance.

1099
01:10:54.467 --> 01:10:55.512
Um...

1100
01:10:57.209 --> 01:10:59.255
Pet-- Petrol then. petrol.

1101
01:11:00.865 --> 01:11:02.170
Yeah.
- Yeah.

1102
01:11:02.345 --> 01:11:04.912
I mean...
I had to get her attention.

1103
01:11:05.086 --> 01:11:07.045
and once I did. she...

1104
01:11:07.828 --> 01:11:09.526
got real chatty.

1105
01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.136
How else do you think I knew
it was gonna happen to you?

1106
01:11:12.485 --> 01:11:14.574
Well. I don't know. So...

1107
01:11:15.096 --> 01:11:18.404
so you...
you said you told Wallace

1108
01:11:18.578 --> 01:11:20.014
that you were looking
for things. What are they?

1109
01:11:21.364 --> 01:11:22.800
Pictures. videos.

1110
01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:25.716
They documented everything.
not just me.

1111
01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:28.762
- It's the truth. It's the truth.

1112
01:11:30.764 --> 01:11:33.376
Okay. So... Right. So. how many
times has that gone off?

1113
01:11:33.985 --> 01:11:34.942
A few times.

1114
01:11:35.378 --> 01:11:36.814
It is your sergeant.

1115
01:11:37.641 --> 01:11:40.078
I'm sure it is because you left
a huge crime scene

1116
01:11:40.252 --> 01:11:41.558
and I should be over there.

1117
01:11:41.732 --> 01:11:43.299
So. the thing is. Jamie.

1118
01:11:43.473 --> 01:11:45.823
is that I'm actually
too fucking sore to fight you.

1119
01:11:45.997 --> 01:11:48.565
So. can you just come in here
and watch or please leave.

1120
01:11:48.739 --> 01:11:50.436
because I do have work to do.

1121
01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:55.485
I don't wanna fight you.
Cassie Holt.

1122
01:11:59.837 --> 01:12:02.143
Though. I guess
we'll have to at some point.

1123
01:12:05.451 --> 01:12:08.933
But please don't kill anyone
in the car park on your way out.

1124
01:12:09.107 --> 01:12:10.326
Can't promise.

1125
01:12:11.979 --> 01:12:13.154
Fuck's sake.

1126
01:12:38.615 --> 01:12:39.703
Morning.

1127
01:12:41.052 --> 01:12:42.532
Your car smells funny.

1128
01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:44.925
I wonder how that happened.

1129
01:12:46.579 --> 01:12:48.407
Any sudden moves.
and I'll shoot you in the hip

1130
01:12:48.581 --> 01:12:49.713
and you will never
walk right again.

1131
01:12:49.887 --> 01:12:51.410
so why don't you just sit down?

1132
01:12:59.418 --> 01:13:00.332
All right.

1133
01:13:00.985 --> 01:13:02.552
Avoid head shots.

1134
01:13:03.988 --> 01:13:05.903
Target is just too small.

1135
01:13:06.599 --> 01:13:08.732
Always aim for center mass.

1136
01:13:09.428 --> 01:13:10.603
there's more space.

1137
01:13:11.169 --> 01:13:12.170
Another thing.

1138
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:14.520
the pelvic. you know.

1139
01:13:15.434 --> 01:13:17.001
a shot in the area. you know.

1140
01:13:17.175 --> 01:13:19.525
with a bigger caliber pistol
or a rifle or...

1141
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:21.962
- but yours too. you know?
- Yeah.

1142
01:13:22.136 --> 01:13:24.182
Will incapacitate a threat.

1143
01:13:24.356 --> 01:13:25.270
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1144
01:13:25.444 --> 01:13:26.967
They'll hit the ground like a...

1145
01:13:27.141 --> 01:13:29.100
like a puppet
with the strings cut. okay?

1146
01:13:29.622 --> 01:13:31.189
- Okay.
- It's your turn.

1147
01:13:33.017 --> 01:13:34.671
- Right?
- Okay.

1148
01:13:34.845 --> 01:13:36.890
Okay. Always give the gun
like this to somebody else.

1149
01:13:37.064 --> 01:13:39.371
- Yeah.
- Okay. Never aim to anybody.

1150
01:13:39.719 --> 01:13:41.155
Good. Now this leg
a little bit back.

1151
01:13:41.329 --> 01:13:42.418
There you go. Yeah.

1152
01:13:42.592 --> 01:13:43.810
So you feel steady.

1153
01:13:43.984 --> 01:13:46.030
This finger under. hold the gun.

1154
01:13:46.204 --> 01:13:47.640
Feel that.
you earned that thing.

1155
01:13:47.814 --> 01:13:49.250
It's just part of your body.

1156
01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.427
- Okay.
- Okay. now go for the trigger.

1157
01:13:51.601 --> 01:13:52.515
And...

1158
01:13:53.646 --> 01:13:54.952
it's all yours.

1159
01:13:55.126 --> 01:13:56.344
Shoot?
Yeah.

1160
01:14:06.006 --> 01:14:07.704
Good to finally meet you.
Miss Holt.

1161
01:14:14.885 --> 01:14:17.496
So. you and your friends
did some research on me?

1162
01:14:18.105 --> 01:14:20.543
Not my friends.
but. yes. yes I did.

1163
01:14:20.717 --> 01:14:23.197
Okay. So. what are you.
a mercenary or a pimp?

1164
01:14:23.371 --> 01:14:25.025
I guess it depends on the day
that you catch me.

1165
01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:26.418
I see.

1166
01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:29.987
I work for Harrison though.
Not them.

1167
01:14:30.161 --> 01:14:31.728
I do the same PI stuff as you.

1168
01:14:31.902 --> 01:14:33.512
Oh. I don't know about that.

1169
01:14:33.686 --> 01:14:34.992
I've never had to get rid
of a strangled kid's body.

1170
01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:38.256
- Does that pay well or?
- You've spoken to Jamie?

1171
01:14:38.517 --> 01:14:41.433
Yes. I have spoken to Jamie.
So. here's what's gonna happen.

1172
01:14:41.607 --> 01:14:44.262
If you give me some information
that's incriminating.

1173
01:14:44.436 --> 01:14:45.742
I'll let you go.

1174
01:14:45.916 --> 01:14:48.222
And if you don't.
then I'll tell Jamie

1175
01:14:48.396 --> 01:14:50.660
to reconsider her decision
to let you live.

1176
01:14:51.312 --> 01:14:52.488
Do we have a deal?

1177
01:14:54.577 --> 01:14:55.578
Deal.

1178
01:14:55.752 --> 01:14:56.709
Deal.

1179
01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:00.583
How many of them were there?

1180
01:15:01.279 --> 01:15:02.759
No idea.

1181
01:15:02.933 --> 01:15:04.587
They've been doing it
since they were young.

1182
01:15:04.761 --> 01:15:07.241
Jamie was there the longest.
They get bored really quick.

1183
01:15:07.415 --> 01:15:09.156
Yeah. And then what happens?
Because they don't kill them.

1184
01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:10.810
No. they don't.

1185
01:15:10.984 --> 01:15:12.986
Not when I was there at least.
just that one.

1186
01:15:15.728 --> 01:15:17.513
They get bored
and I relocate them.

1187
01:15:18.078 --> 01:15:20.254
Relocate? Relocate. Explain.

1188
01:15:20.428 --> 01:15:22.082
Explain that to me
like I'm stupid.

1189
01:15:23.214 --> 01:15:24.432
I take them to Russia.

1190
01:15:27.697 --> 01:15:28.915
Fuck.

1191
01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.178
They were unfit for normal life.

1192
01:15:33.746 --> 01:15:34.965
You sell them for money.

1193
01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:37.620
God help you.

1194
01:15:37.794 --> 01:15:39.099
God fucking help you.

1195
01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.235
It's fucking tragic
that she didn't kill you.

1196
01:15:46.716 --> 01:15:48.413
Okay.

1197
01:15:48.935 --> 01:15:51.677
So... where are these trophies?

1198
01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:53.244
Because that's what's
gonna get you cut loose.

1199
01:15:53.418 --> 01:15:54.898
these photos and videos.

1200
01:15:55.463 --> 01:15:57.857
Any half-ass solicitor would
throw that as inadmissible.

1201
01:15:58.031 --> 01:16:00.251
That might be true. but did
you know Harrison has kept

1202
01:16:00.425 --> 01:16:03.123
very detailed notes of every
euro he paid you and what for?

1203
01:16:03.297 --> 01:16:06.823
What? That's black bag shit.
Who keeps records of that?

1204
01:16:06.997 --> 01:16:08.694
In a few hours.
Detective Sergeant McMahon

1205
01:16:08.868 --> 01:16:11.262
and the Gardaí are gonna
raid your boss's office.

1206
01:16:12.176 --> 01:16:13.830
So. pretty please.

1207
01:16:14.004 --> 01:16:15.962
with sugar on fucking top.

1208
01:16:16.267 --> 01:16:17.573
where are the trophies?

1209
01:16:26.799 --> 01:16:28.018
At the playhouse.

1210
01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.020
There's a room full of them.

1211
01:16:30.847 --> 01:16:32.326
But this is gonna get me loose. right?

1212
01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:33.980
Yeah. Glenn.

1213
01:16:34.981 --> 01:16:36.026
Glenn--

1214
01:16:40.639 --> 01:16:42.902
You said if I give you
information. you'd cut me loose.

1215
01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:44.861
I lied.

1216
01:18:37.016 --> 01:18:38.888
Mr. And Mrs. Evans.
I'm Cassie Holt.

1217
01:18:39.062 --> 01:18:40.759
I know who you are.

1218
01:18:40.933 --> 01:18:41.804
So. you know I'm here
to investigate the murders

1219
01:18:41.978 --> 01:18:43.283
of a couple of friends of yours.

1220
01:18:43.457 --> 01:18:45.416
Dottie. don't talk to her.
Get in the car.

1221
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:47.287
Are you investigating?

1222
01:18:47.461 --> 01:18:49.289
Or are you working with that
little bitch picking us off?

1223
01:18:49.463 --> 01:18:50.856
What?

1224
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:53.032
You didn't pay attention
to the message we sent.

1225
01:18:53.206 --> 01:18:55.295
Right. well.
thank you for that confirmation.

1226
01:18:55.643 --> 01:18:57.167
Dottie. come back here.

1227
01:18:57.341 --> 01:18:59.996
Miss Holt. would you please
move your car?

1228
01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:02.346
What is she. your girlfriend?

1229
01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.565
All the broken dollies
playing together.

1230
01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.263
I think that
might be close enough.

1231
01:19:06.437 --> 01:19:07.699
What's the matter?

1232
01:19:07.873 --> 01:19:09.005
Are you afraid
I'm going to hurt you?

1233
01:19:09.179 --> 01:19:10.658
Believe me.

1234
01:19:10.833 --> 01:19:13.313
you are in far more danger
than I am right now.

1235
01:19:13.705 --> 01:19:16.012
Did she tell you
about the time we had her?

1236
01:19:16.186 --> 01:19:17.622
Dottie. stop talking.

1237
01:19:17.796 --> 01:19:19.450
She was with us for years.

1238
01:19:19.624 --> 01:19:22.627
In fact. I'd love to get you
in the playhouse.

1239
01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:24.672
Shame you're so old.

1240
01:19:24.847 --> 01:19:26.979
Dottie! Get in the goddamn car!

1241
01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:30.591
Please.

1242
01:19:31.418 --> 01:19:32.550
move your car.

1243
01:20:06.062 --> 01:20:08.194
Oh. my God.
it's so good to be out.

1244
01:20:08.847 --> 01:20:11.894
I couldn't stand being locked
in that house any longer.

1245
01:20:12.068 --> 01:20:13.460
We should have stayed.

1246
01:20:14.331 --> 01:20:15.811
Jamie's still out there.

1247
01:20:16.594 --> 01:20:17.943
The Holt girl.

1248
01:20:19.597 --> 01:20:21.207
We should have called Victor.

1249
01:20:22.078 --> 01:20:24.341
Victor will lose his mind
when he finds out.

1250
01:20:24.515 --> 01:20:26.952
Jesus. when did you turn
into such a pussy?

1251
01:20:27.735 --> 01:20:29.346
You're not the man I married.

1252
01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.565
let alone the person
I grew up with.

1253
01:20:32.784 --> 01:20:35.178
I saw a little of the old you
when you grabbed me.

1254
01:20:35.352 --> 01:20:36.832
You should let him out more.

1255
01:20:38.007 --> 01:20:39.660
"Victor will be mad."

1256
01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:41.010
Like I give a shit.

1257
01:20:43.926 --> 01:20:44.927
Come on.

1258
01:21:09.342 --> 01:21:10.953
<i>You know. I asked them
what we should do</i>

1259
01:21:11.127 --> 01:21:12.868
<i>'cause we're
in this predicament right now</i>

1260
01:21:13.042 --> 01:21:15.653
<i>and they've instructed me
and I certainly didn't...</i>

1261
01:21:16.001 --> 01:21:18.264
<i>didn't actually go through
with any of it so.</i>

1262
01:21:18.438 --> 01:21:20.136
<i>So. you didn't actually
intend any harm</i>

1263
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:22.790
<i>on the people that
they instructed you to injure?</i>

1264
01:21:22.965 --> 01:21:24.270
<i>No. none whatsoever.</i>

1265
01:21:28.535 --> 01:21:29.536
Hi.

1266
01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:30.798
McMahon's talking to Wallace.

1267
01:21:30.973 --> 01:21:32.583
Sounds like they're wrapping up.

1268
01:21:32.757 --> 01:21:34.628
<i>And how much
of this work</i>

1269
01:21:34.802 --> 01:21:37.718
<i>are you willing
to divulge here today?</i>

1270
01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:39.807
<i>All of it.</i>

1271
01:21:49.643 --> 01:21:50.731
What do you think?

1272
01:21:51.384 --> 01:21:54.039
Tossing the patrons out too.
that was a nice touch.

1273
01:21:54.213 --> 01:21:57.260
Wallace went from combative
to unnerved real quick.

1274
01:21:58.826 --> 01:22:01.133
I mean. you got the confession
of her own free will.

1275
01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:03.353
You'll get the warrant
on Harrison with that.

1276
01:22:04.006 --> 01:22:05.224
All right. Get off my desk.

1277
01:22:17.193 --> 01:22:18.716
Where should we go for dinner?

1278
01:22:19.630 --> 01:22:20.761
I don't know.

1279
01:22:22.459 --> 01:22:23.982
Maybe we should get a takeaway.

1280
01:22:24.156 --> 01:22:25.549
Absolutely not.

1281
01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:27.986
I want a meal fixed
by someone else

1282
01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.033
in a proper dining room.
where I don't have to do dishes.

1283
01:22:32.121 --> 01:22:33.122
Come on.

1284
01:22:35.385 --> 01:22:37.561
It can be fun if we make it fun.

1285
01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:40.651
In fact.
if you do this for me...

1286
01:22:50.182 --> 01:22:51.183
Yes.

1287
01:23:26.784 --> 01:23:28.655
Dottie! Dottie!

1288
01:23:30.527 --> 01:23:31.658
Help me!

1289
01:23:53.158 --> 01:23:54.986
Okay. listen up.

1290
01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.075
We're about to execute
the warrant on the office

1291
01:23:57.249 --> 01:23:59.469
and home of Victor Harrison.

1292
01:24:02.602 --> 01:24:04.474
Detective Sargent's office.
please hold.

1293
01:24:05.475 --> 01:24:06.867
Detective Sar-- What?

1294
01:24:07.303 --> 01:24:08.782
Wait. where?

1295
01:24:09.218 --> 01:24:11.959
What? Hey look. I'm gonna put
you on with Detective Sergeant.

1296
01:24:12.743 --> 01:24:14.440
This is McMahon. How can I...

1297
01:24:14.614 --> 01:24:16.747
Whoa. Slow down. slow down.
Take a breath. Just tell me.

1298
01:24:18.531 --> 01:24:20.316
Okay? Right.
Yeah. we'll be right there.

1299
01:24:20.968 --> 01:24:22.535
Okay. change of plan.

1300
01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:25.103
We're gonna split up.
Glenn. Murphy and O'Brien.

1301
01:24:25.277 --> 01:24:27.497
I want you to head down
to the main street.

1302
01:24:27.671 --> 01:24:31.109
Apparently. our suspect
attacked Edgar and Dottie Evans.

1303
01:24:50.868 --> 01:24:53.175
Pepper spray smarts.
doesn't it?

1304
01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.309
This will make it better.

1305
01:24:57.483 --> 01:25:00.182
I don't know why. but it does.

1306
01:25:11.367 --> 01:25:13.499
You know. you can't get away.

1307
01:25:13.673 --> 01:25:15.066
unless I let you go.

1308
01:25:15.675 --> 01:25:17.199
You know that. right?

1309
01:25:41.875 --> 01:25:42.920
Gentlemen.

1310
01:25:48.882 --> 01:25:50.928
Give me a reason.
you degenerate prick.

1311
01:25:53.539 --> 01:25:55.846
You caught yourself a big fish.
didn't you?

1312
01:26:02.244 --> 01:26:03.288
Fucker.

1313
01:26:03.810 --> 01:26:04.855
Arrest him.

1314
01:26:11.383 --> 01:26:12.341
So...

1315
01:26:15.126 --> 01:26:17.607
you like sharp things.

1316
01:26:38.497 --> 01:26:41.761
This all stops
if you say four little words.

1317
01:26:41.935 --> 01:26:43.241
just like back then.

1318
01:26:44.024 --> 01:26:45.112
- Say...

1319
01:26:45.287 --> 01:26:47.419
..."I love you Mommy."

1320
01:26:48.115 --> 01:26:49.769
"I love you. Mommy."

1321
01:26:51.293 --> 01:26:54.861
Fuck you!

1322
01:26:55.035 --> 01:26:57.777
Fuck you.

1323
01:27:00.302 --> 01:27:01.781
Cassie.

1324
01:27:01.955 --> 01:27:04.044
I've been holding him here
as long as I could.

1325
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:13.663
Cassie Holt.
interviewing Edgar Evans.

1326
01:27:13.837 --> 01:27:15.317
Fuck's sake.

1327
01:27:15.491 --> 01:27:17.275
Edgar. I need you
to explain everything to me.

1328
01:27:18.972 --> 01:27:21.758
Dottie's abandoned you.
She's left you for dead.

1329
01:27:21.932 --> 01:27:23.716
McMahon is raiding
Harrison's office

1330
01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:26.066
and Wallace is being handed over
to the government.

1331
01:27:28.939 --> 01:27:30.680
You're gonna have
to fucking talk. Edgar.

1332
01:27:30.854 --> 01:27:32.203
This is your only chance.

1333
01:27:33.204 --> 01:27:34.249
Fuck.

1334
01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:37.600
No one cared about them.

1335
01:27:38.557 --> 01:27:41.517
No one missed them.
They were just tossed away.

1336
01:27:42.344 --> 01:27:45.260
No one cared about who. Edgar?

1337
01:27:45.434 --> 01:27:47.958
All of them.

1338
01:27:49.873 --> 01:27:50.917
Tell me about Jamie.

1339
01:27:52.528 --> 01:27:54.312
Dottie was always forceful.

1340
01:27:54.486 --> 01:27:56.183
That's why I liked her.

1341
01:27:56.358 --> 01:27:58.011
We grew up together.

1342
01:27:58.447 --> 01:27:59.448
Jamie...

1343
01:27:59.622 --> 01:28:01.232
Jamie was rebellious.

1344
01:28:02.929 --> 01:28:04.714
That's why Dottie liked her.

1345
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:08.152
That's why she took her.

1346
01:28:08.326 --> 01:28:10.415
But you took her too.
didn't you. Edgar?

1347
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:13.375
- You fucking took her too.

1348
01:28:16.726 --> 01:28:18.815
- Fuck! Fuck!
What happened?

1349
01:28:20.382 --> 01:28:21.557
He stroked out.

1350
01:28:22.079 --> 01:28:23.602
Did he give you a confession?

1351
01:28:24.037 --> 01:28:25.343
- No.

1352
01:28:25.517 --> 01:28:26.649
One second.

1353
01:28:28.041 --> 01:28:28.999
Yeah?

1354
01:28:29.173 --> 01:28:30.305
I've got your bitch.

1355
01:28:30.479 --> 01:28:31.958
Hang up. Cassie.

1356
01:28:32.872 --> 01:28:34.918
<i>- Don't listen to her.</i>
<i>Just a moment.</i>

1357
01:28:35.745 --> 01:28:37.877
Jamie has something
she'd like to say to you.

1358
01:28:45.058 --> 01:28:46.146
I'm gonna find you.

1359
01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:47.583
You know where I am.

1360
01:28:51.978 --> 01:28:53.328
Cassie? Cassie!?

1361
01:29:06.558 --> 01:29:08.430
- You want it to stop. do you?
- Please.

1362
01:29:08.604 --> 01:29:10.127
- You want it to stop?
- Yeah.

1363
01:29:10.301 --> 01:29:11.824
Then you can say it.

1364
01:29:12.172 --> 01:29:13.913
Tell me. Come on.

1365
01:29:14.087 --> 01:29:15.785
Say it. Say it.

1366
01:29:16.612 --> 01:29:18.483
What do you say?
What do you say?

1367
01:29:19.092 --> 01:29:20.442
What do you say?

1368
01:29:27.013 --> 01:29:28.363
Yeah. Mommy.

1369
01:29:30.626 --> 01:29:32.932
Mommy! Mommy!

1370
01:29:33.106 --> 01:29:34.630
That's good.

1371
01:29:34.891 --> 01:29:35.979
Say it!

1372
01:30:21.546 --> 01:30:24.375
Jamie! Jamie!

1373
01:30:29.511 --> 01:30:30.425
Jesus.

1374
01:30:33.993 --> 01:30:35.821
- I have to call ambulance.
- No.

1375
01:30:36.735 --> 01:30:37.910
I'm done.

1376
01:30:40.086 --> 01:30:41.305
Can you help me up?

1377
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:50.053
Did Edgar die?

1378
01:30:53.056 --> 01:30:57.103
Oh. He stroked out
while I was talking to him.

1379
01:30:57.277 --> 01:30:58.278
Shit.

1380
01:31:00.324 --> 01:31:01.456
I tried.

1381
01:31:04.981 --> 01:31:07.113
- It's too much.
I know.

1382
01:31:08.288 --> 01:31:10.465
- Can I tell you one more story?
- Yes.

1383
01:31:11.727 --> 01:31:12.684
Yeah.

1384
01:31:14.338 --> 01:31:16.732
Do you mind if I record it.
so I can vindicate you?

1385
01:31:16.906 --> 01:31:19.299
Yeah.

1386
01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:21.084
- Okay.

1387
01:31:21.258 --> 01:31:22.389
Yes.

1388
01:31:28.570 --> 01:31:29.571
Okay.

1389
01:31:31.877 --> 01:31:33.618
They would have these parties

1390
01:31:34.445 --> 01:31:37.100
and we just have to stand there.

1391
01:31:37.274 --> 01:31:39.015
you know. naked

1392
01:31:39.929 --> 01:31:41.844
per usual and...

1393
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:44.281
they would rent...

1394
01:31:45.761 --> 01:31:49.460
they would rent us.
for the night.

1395
01:31:52.768 --> 01:31:54.421
When I got pregnant...

1396
01:31:55.945 --> 01:31:57.816
they made sure
it never would happen again

1397
01:31:57.990 --> 01:32:00.253
because they got a friend
who was a doctor

1398
01:32:00.906 --> 01:32:02.038
to fix it.

1399
01:32:03.605 --> 01:32:05.171
And I wasn't the only one.

1400
01:32:05.781 --> 01:32:07.478
There were
so many others like me.

1401
01:32:12.265 --> 01:32:13.266
Cassie.

1402
01:32:14.441 --> 01:32:15.530
They ruined me

1403
01:32:16.139 --> 01:32:17.314
for everything.

1404
01:32:17.923 --> 01:32:21.710
I can't go on broken
and I can't go back.

1405
01:32:22.449 --> 01:32:23.929
They created a monster

1406
01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.541
and I chose to be a monster.

1407
01:32:26.715 --> 01:32:28.804
And I am going to die a monster.

1408
01:32:28.978 --> 01:32:30.022
Okay.

1409
01:32:31.067 --> 01:32:32.547
That's good. Okay.

1410
01:32:36.855 --> 01:32:39.162
Hey.
I need you to help me.

1411
01:32:39.336 --> 01:32:41.338
Yes. with what? Tell me.

1412
01:32:42.339 --> 01:32:44.036
What you told me when we met.

1413
01:32:44.602 --> 01:32:46.125
Oh. no. no. no. no. no. no.

1414
01:32:46.299 --> 01:32:47.823
No. you promised.

1415
01:32:47.997 --> 01:32:49.085
I know.

1416
01:32:49.825 --> 01:32:52.131
You promised. I'm tired.
- Darling. that was before.

1417
01:32:52.305 --> 01:32:53.306
I'm tired.

1418
01:32:53.611 --> 01:32:55.047
That was before!

1419
01:32:55.352 --> 01:32:56.919
- That was before.
- I need this.

1420
01:32:57.484 --> 01:32:59.835
I need this. I'm tired.

1421
01:33:00.662 --> 01:33:01.967
I'm so tired.

1422
01:33:02.141 --> 01:33:05.188
I'm tired of all of it.
Please. just...

1423
01:33:08.452 --> 01:33:09.584
Come on.

1424
01:33:11.542 --> 01:33:12.499
Please.

1425
01:33:13.326 --> 01:33:14.632
Cassie Holt.

1426
01:33:14.806 --> 01:33:17.722
I-- I can't.
- Cassie Holt.

1427
01:33:18.941 --> 01:33:20.116
Just do it.

1428
01:33:26.426 --> 01:33:28.167
I'm so sorry...

1429
01:33:29.734 --> 01:33:31.518
about what happened to you.

1430
01:33:34.217 --> 01:33:35.522
I'm sorry about him.

1431
01:33:41.703 --> 01:33:42.834
Do it for him.

1432
01:33:46.751 --> 01:33:48.927
It's okay. Do it for me.

1433
01:33:50.189 --> 01:33:51.147
Fuck.

1434
01:33:58.937 --> 01:34:01.374
Ellie and I never got around
to having kids.

1435
01:34:02.071 --> 01:34:03.159
Truth is...

1436
01:34:04.334 --> 01:34:07.119
when we were young.
we were kind of selfish.

1437
01:34:08.425 --> 01:34:09.731
wanted to travel.

1438
01:34:09.905 --> 01:34:12.559
work on careers.
things like that.

1439
01:34:12.734 --> 01:34:13.778
Yeah.

1440
01:34:14.518 --> 01:34:16.694
After a while.
they seemed wrong.

1441
01:34:17.913 --> 01:34:19.218
I regret that now.

1442
01:34:20.089 --> 01:34:22.178
Yeah. no. I would've been
a good father. I think.

1443
01:34:22.352 --> 01:34:24.310
No. you would've been
a great father.

1444
01:34:24.484 --> 01:34:26.399
I like to think so.

1445
01:34:27.792 --> 01:34:30.099
Another thing that happen
when you get to a certain age

1446
01:34:30.273 --> 01:34:34.233
is that you become
both deeply aware of

1447
01:34:34.407 --> 01:34:36.235
and comfortable with death.

1448
01:34:37.367 --> 01:34:38.673
<i>Your own mostly.</i>

1449
01:34:40.326 --> 01:34:42.502
<i>but past a certain age
you understand</i>

1450
01:34:43.503 --> 01:34:46.593
<i>that you have hid
this kind of magical land</i>

1451
01:34:46.768 --> 01:34:49.074
<i>where you can drop dead</i>

1452
01:34:49.248 --> 01:34:51.642
<i>at any time from anything.</i>

1453
01:34:52.817 --> 01:34:55.777
<i>you hope it doesn't.
but it could.</i>

1454
01:35:06.526 --> 01:35:07.658
<i>Some people get...</i>

1455
01:35:08.398 --> 01:35:10.835
obsessed with their legacy.

1456
01:35:12.663 --> 01:35:14.056
But honestly...

1457
01:35:15.971 --> 01:35:18.277
I don't think I've been
too concerned with that.

1458
01:35:19.801 --> 01:35:22.368
Kids are the obvious legacy.
you know.

1459
01:35:22.542 --> 01:35:24.240
but if you don't have those...

1460
01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:39.298
<i>You know. I wish Ellie
could have known you.</i>

1461
01:35:41.126 --> 01:35:42.737
She would've liked you. Yeah.

1462
01:35:44.869 --> 01:35:46.653
She would have been
harder on you than I am.

1463
01:35:46.828 --> 01:35:47.959
Not possible.

1464
01:35:48.133 --> 01:35:50.440
- Yes. it's possible.

1465
01:35:51.484 --> 01:35:53.051
But it would've been because...

1466
01:35:54.009 --> 01:35:55.619
she would've seen
your potential.

1467
01:35:56.751 --> 01:35:58.491
She was very good at that.

1468
01:35:59.971 --> 01:36:02.757
She saw potential in me
when I certainly didn't.

1469
01:36:02.931 --> 01:36:05.672
And...

1470
01:36:05.847 --> 01:36:08.023
and I know she would've been
more than fine with this.

1471
01:36:08.197 --> 01:36:09.024
you know?

1472
01:36:14.290 --> 01:36:15.726
So. uh...

1473
01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:20.383
the company is...

1474
01:36:21.036 --> 01:36:23.429
from this point on
in both our names.

1475
01:36:23.821 --> 01:36:24.866
What?

1476
01:36:26.215 --> 01:36:27.956
It's not a hell of a lot.

1477
01:36:28.913 --> 01:36:30.393
but it is. I guess.

1478
01:36:31.002 --> 01:36:32.351
what legacy I have.

1479
01:36:36.878 --> 01:36:38.705
Really? What?

1480
01:36:40.316 --> 01:36:41.317
Thank you.

1481
01:36:45.234 --> 01:36:47.714
Listen. I am going to head
down to Rory's.

1482
01:36:47.889 --> 01:36:50.108
just to continue working
on the case.

1483
01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:54.721
I'll talk to you
in a couple of days. Okay?
