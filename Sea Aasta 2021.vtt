"Land is the only essential condition
for our existence."

00:00:23.048 --> 00:00:25.357
Hasso Krull 2020

5
00:00:59.669 --> 00:01:02.387
The most intoxicating summer
of the last half century in Estonia

6
00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:04.726
is coming to an end.

7
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:08.941
And I don't agree with those who think
we haven't achieved anything special.

8
00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:11.765
we achieved a lot
and something very important.

9
00:01:12.032 --> 00:01:17.937
And let a thousand winters pass.
we can wait for this special moment.

10
00:01:18.343 --> 00:01:23.828
One day our blue-black-white flag
will be on top of the Tall Hermann tower.

11
00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:28.141
"Year of the Dragon" (1988)
director Andres Sööt

12
00:01:30.637 --> 00:01:34.677
One day. no matter what. we will win!

13
00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:41.278
30 years ago.
when Andres Sööt filmed those shots.

14
00:01:41.442 --> 00:01:44.856
we all believed
that life could only get better.

15
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:48.341
We wanted to decide for ourselves
the fruits of our labor

16
00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:51.364
and to achieve the same prosperity
as in those countries

17
00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:54.559
that set an example for us
with their culture and people.

18
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.286
Now. in the fall of 2018.
that goal seemed to have been achieved.

19
00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:05.145
but the world around us had changed.

20
00:02:14.845 --> 00:02:19.059
Pope Francis. who visited Estonia.
called on people to turn...

21
00:02:19.462 --> 00:02:20.950
towards ecology.

22
00:02:30.405 --> 00:02:33.483
I started making this movie
because it seemed to me

23
00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:36.679
that we had reached a place from which
the road does not go any further.

24
00:02:37.015 --> 00:02:38.820
Sõrve Peninsula. Saaremaa

25
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.423
One of the reasons for my pessimism
was the publicist Kaupo Vipp.

26
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:46.322
who. in his books "Global Hangover"
and "Local Healing".

27
00:02:46.548 --> 00:02:48.736
has painted a rather disillusioned picture

28
00:02:48.816 --> 00:02:52.008
of the future of a society
based on infinite economic growth.

29
00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:58.197
We have a complete catastrophic
contradiction between two disciplines.

30
00:02:58.273 --> 00:03:00.516
such as economics and ecology.

31
00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:02.867
Kaupo Vipp
Estonian Association for the Club of Rome

32
00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:06.165
Ecology is really nothing more than -

33
00:03:06.556 --> 00:03:09.376
"oikos" is home and "logos" is a story.

34
00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:12.642
in short. a description
of what this home is like where we live.

35
00:03:12.837 --> 00:03:17.735
Economics - again. "oikos" is home
and "nomus" is teaching.

36
00:03:17.813 --> 00:03:20.633
Teaching on how to live in this home.

37
00:03:21.032 --> 00:03:23.665
But what kind of schizophrenia must it be.

38
00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:27.118
is the description of our home.
of what our home should be like.

39
00:03:27.227 --> 00:03:29.243
is in absolute contradiction

40
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.954
with the nature of the teaching
on how to behave in this home.

41
00:04:30.472 --> 00:04:33.433
Our system is designed
to grow all the time.

42
00:04:33.495 --> 00:04:36.878
there must be economic growth
because there are more and more people.

43
00:04:37.175 --> 00:04:39.159
In the absence of economic growth.

44
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.323
we would increasingly need
to redistribute what we have.

45
00:05:05.578 --> 00:05:08.641
If our civilization continues
in this form.

46
00:05:09.094 --> 00:05:12.766
then it reaches its limit

47
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:19.180
somewhere between 2030 and 2050.

48
00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:20.969
Then follows the collapse.

49
00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:26.339
Square in front of Parliament

50
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.633
The world had become
more and more restless.

51
00:05:30.672 --> 00:05:34.305
The example of new political movements
soon reached Estonia.

52
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.750
and the existing idols became the enemies.

53
00:05:38.882 --> 00:05:42.492
Suddenly. people were forced
to choose sides again.

54
00:05:43.908 --> 00:05:46.983
There was a new kind of viciousness
and radicalism in the air.

55
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.029
Down with Social Democrats!

56
00:05:50.304 --> 00:05:53.382
This country has become absurd.

57
00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:59.335
since this country is completely alienated
from the masters of this country.

58
00:05:59.762 --> 00:06:01.811
Estonia is a nation state.

59
00:06:02.108 --> 00:06:04.710
Estonia is a country created by Estonians

60
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.225
and our forefathers shed blood
for this land. for us!

61
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.483
There is no force that can change

62
00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:18.248
these established habits or beliefs.

63
00:06:18.983 --> 00:06:25.998
That's where this rather gloomy version
of scenarios comes from for us.

64
00:06:26.326 --> 00:06:28.748
Let's lose the nation state.

65
00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:32.608
let's make a global government.
let's regulate things somehow.

66
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:35.237
But as long as there are nation states.

67
00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.838
they think about their well-being.
and tend to compete with others.

68
00:06:38.971 --> 00:06:40.889
and so the growth continues.

69
00:06:41.162 --> 00:06:45.623
I think it's also absurd. because
the same system can't go on like this.

70
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.826
This same system is still doomed.
whether it is changed in some way or not.

71
00:06:56.625 --> 00:07:00.192
While there was some talk in the autumn
that the system needed to be changed.

72
00:07:00.372 --> 00:07:02.832
the closer to the new year
and the elections.

73
00:07:03.072 --> 00:07:05.076
the less it was reminded.

74
00:07:06.608 --> 00:07:09.786
After all. the economy was growing.
wages were increasing.

75
00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:11.903
department stores were built.

76
00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:19.897
Hello. dear guests. My emotions are high.

77
00:07:24.476 --> 00:07:27.398
Taavi Aas
Mayor of Tallinn

78
00:07:27.686 --> 00:07:30.334
Ladies and gentlemen!

79
00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:35.475
Estonians are doing better and better.

80
00:07:38.702 --> 00:07:41.723
And if our people are doing better.

81
00:07:41.822 --> 00:07:46.631
then there is definitely more reason
to go to the mall.

82
00:07:47.678 --> 00:07:52.772
get some entertainment.
go to a restaurant. go to the cinema.

83
00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:55.225
and it's all available here.

84
00:08:00.366 --> 00:08:06.561
I wish you favorable shopping
and pleasant entertainment.

85
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.293
This was the prologue
at the beginning of the new year.

86
00:08:40.652 --> 00:08:42.273
Thinking of Andres Sööt.

87
00:08:42.329 --> 00:08:46.012
I decided to name this film
also according to the Chinese zodiac.

88
00:08:46.645 --> 00:08:50.113
All the more so since the starting
last year of the cycle

89
00:08:50.207 --> 00:08:53.488
was ruled by the earth element.
which is so important to us.

90
00:09:16.747 --> 00:09:21.699
YEAR OF THE PIG

91
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:29.739
"Our homeland is our faith.
the land under our feet and our king.

92
00:09:29.856 --> 00:09:34.137
What about their homeland?
What is it. does anyone understand?”

93
00:09:34.262 --> 00:09:38.098
A call to the French
counter-revolutionaries in 1794

94
00:09:40.129 --> 00:09:45.110
You can choose a poster here at the tower.
but please bring it back later.

95
00:09:45.188 --> 00:09:46.563
TOGETHER WE CAN DO EVERYTHING!

96
00:09:49.429 --> 00:09:51.376
WOMEN'S MARCH

97
00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:56.212
Take this one:
"I am not a harmful element to society."

98
00:09:58.334 --> 00:10:02.865
I'll take this one.
"Let the violence be…"

99
00:10:03.408 --> 00:10:04.412
Oh...

100
00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:07.355
RAPISTS AND BEATERS TO JAIL!

101
00:10:07.697 --> 00:10:08.717
Oh!

102
00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:12.602
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.
WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE THE WORLD!

103
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:18.790
<i>Estonian man is not a fool.</i>

104
00:10:19.368 --> 00:10:24.904
<i>Estonian man is not a fool.
he's not afraid of Jewish threats...</i>

105
00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:30.690
Attack!

106
00:10:34.304 --> 00:10:39.174
<i>He smashes red commissars
just like bedbugs…</i>

107
00:10:51.255 --> 00:10:56.306
We won the War of Independence
because we dared and decided to resist

108
00:10:56.782 --> 00:11:00.017
and because we were able to find allies.

109
00:11:00.382 --> 00:11:05.596
And 20 years later.
when this statue was to be opened.

110
00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:09.994
we lost our freedom and our country.

111
00:11:10.783 --> 00:11:15.190
We lost because we decided not to resist.

112
00:11:16.104 --> 00:11:18.908
But the 21st century is much more hopeful

113
00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:22.604
because so many are standing with us
and beside us.

114
00:11:23.102 --> 00:11:25.612
And if you know who is with you.

115
00:11:25.932 --> 00:11:30.334
then it doesn't really matter
who is against you.

116
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.041
Happy New Year!

117
00:11:47.403 --> 00:11:49.416
EVERYONE COUNTS!

118
00:11:49.814 --> 00:11:51.572
FAIR STATE FOR ALL!

119
00:11:53.493 --> 00:11:55.587
FATHERLAND IS PROTECTED

120
00:11:56.476 --> 00:11:58.682
BETTER FUTURE!

121
00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:10.883
ELECTION DEBATE 2019

122
00:12:12.844 --> 00:12:15.664
Today. it is nice to read

123
00:12:15.758 --> 00:12:19.500
that the number of births
exceeds the deaths by four thousand.

124
00:12:19.633 --> 00:12:22.649
The birth rate
is pretty seriously positive.

125
00:12:22.772 --> 00:12:27.211
But in fact. in the coming decades.
the Estonian population will decrease.

126
00:12:27.297 --> 00:12:31.851
It is clear that the world is globalizing.
capital is concentrated in the centers.

127
00:12:32.211 --> 00:12:36.254
And if we think about it in a way
that we'll close all the borders

128
00:12:36.336 --> 00:12:39.282
and isolate ourselves.
then we will disappear instead.

129
00:12:39.538 --> 00:12:45.313
But one day we will be in a situation
where we are in the minority

130
00:12:45.485 --> 00:12:47.399
and whether it will be Estonia anymore.

131
00:12:47.485 --> 00:12:48.688
Thank you!

132
00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:54.946
What awaits the world
is a very big change.

133
00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:58.563
But. I repeat.
there are three whales in our wealth -

134
00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:01.164
forest. oil shale and phosphorite!

135
00:13:40.731 --> 00:13:43.164
INCREASE OF CHILD BENEFIT TO 100 EURO

136
00:13:44.608 --> 00:13:46.670
FOR LOWER TAXES!

137
00:13:47.132 --> 00:13:49.195
FOR A PROSPEROUS ESTONIA!

138
00:13:49.386 --> 00:13:51.898
FAIR STATE FOR ALL!

139
00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:12.554
As if in memory
of the War of Independence.

140
00:14:12.702 --> 00:14:15.679
a hundred years later.
we have been given once again

141
00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:19.468
a brighter and lighter and snowier winter.

142
00:14:20.158 --> 00:14:22.820
But there are still shadows somewhere.

143
00:14:23.296 --> 00:14:27.757
In the beginning there is confusion.
because the world around us is changing.

144
00:14:28.342 --> 00:14:31.304
It makes you angry. then comes swearing.

145
00:14:31.882 --> 00:14:38.210
helping us to tear ourselves apart.
to tear our own society apart.

146
00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:47.296
HELP! WOMAN IS NOT HOME AND PREGNANT!

147
00:14:47.928 --> 00:14:50.170
For Estonia!...

148
00:14:51.088 --> 00:14:53.247
FREE ESTONIA - FREE OF RACISM!

149
00:14:56.408 --> 00:14:58.740
EKRE does not know Estonia!

150
00:15:00.827 --> 00:15:05.702
For Estonia!...

151
00:15:19.944 --> 00:15:21.858
Would you like some?

152
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:28.014
It is tartar with rice. rabbit meat.
chicken liver pate and carp.

153
00:15:29.968 --> 00:15:33.490
Hello. would you like some?
- Yes. thank you.

154
00:15:54.182 --> 00:15:59.517
<i>It's dawn. a royal blaze.</i>

155
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:08.376
<i>the victory of light awakens the earth.</i>

156
00:16:10.322 --> 00:16:16.048
<i>The horizon is free.</i>

157
00:16:17.417 --> 00:16:25.145
<i>first ray is falling to our land.</i>

158
00:16:26.455 --> 00:16:31.095
<i>A cry - we'll break everything...</i>

159
00:16:31.536 --> 00:16:35.368
We are a nation
who have not had kingdoms.

160
00:16:35.821 --> 00:16:37.923
who have not had kings.

161
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.645
but who has had something

162
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:46.259
that many nations that have had kings
and kingdoms have not.

163
00:16:46.978 --> 00:16:49.884
It is the will to survive.

164
00:16:50.173 --> 00:16:55.657
Despite the fact that it is said that
nationalism is Europe's greatest enemy

165
00:16:56.004 --> 00:16:59.821
and Europe should move
into post-nation era.

166
00:17:00.048 --> 00:17:05.142
we refuse to make Estonia
a European province.

167
00:17:05.447 --> 00:17:10.212
<i>Faith will lead us forward.</i>

168
00:17:11.891 --> 00:17:17.937
<i>a heavenly ray is walking with us.</i>

169
00:17:20.767 --> 00:17:25.306
<i>Like so - victory</i>

170
00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:33.665
<i>is just one step away.
just a short step...</i>

171
00:17:46.008 --> 00:17:53.196
The question now is whether
the Estonian state will once again

172
00:17:53.469 --> 00:17:57.931
be able to protect Estonia
as a traditional ecological community

173
00:17:58.142 --> 00:18:00.180
from the Estonians themselves.

174
00:18:01.236 --> 00:18:05.665
Well this country and nation.
they can also be such abstract terms.

175
00:18:05.728 --> 00:18:10.822
but the traditional ecological community?
What are we talking about here?

176
00:18:11.743 --> 00:18:16.181
So you're talking about nature
in an intuitive way?

177
00:18:16.539 --> 00:18:18.907
What I mean.

178
00:18:19.007 --> 00:18:25.188
is a very long-term way
of living together.

179
00:18:25.391 --> 00:18:31.258
where people can communicate
with other living beings

180
00:18:31.372 --> 00:18:34.750
for a very long time and well.

181
00:18:34.891 --> 00:18:39.750
And on the other hand.
the landscape in which they live

182
00:18:40.195 --> 00:18:43.532
acquires a certain cosmic dimension
through tradition.

183
00:18:44.486 --> 00:18:46.431
It was an hour and a half?
- Yes.

184
00:18:46.978 --> 00:18:50.499
We have elections coming soon.
the lists of candidates are ready.

185
00:18:50.632 --> 00:18:54.468
I can't imagine that bears.
elk and plants

186
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.203
will run there
in addition to the citizens.

187
00:18:59.085 --> 00:19:06.828
In fact. bears. elk. foxes. wolves.
pines. birches. aspens. heather.

188
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:14.726
the whole undergrowth. insects. etc.
should run in the elections.

189
00:19:16.782 --> 00:19:20.507
No. we know. Jüri.
we know that this wish exists.

190
00:19:20.787 --> 00:19:22.945
Let's start ourselves.

191
00:19:23.132 --> 00:19:26.393
Good evening! The most exciting moments
of the year have arrived.

192
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.725
Tomorrow is the election...

193
00:19:27.796 --> 00:19:32.483
And the heavy artillery of Estonian
politics has lined up in the studio.

194
00:19:32.608 --> 00:19:35.897
At stake is nothing less
than victory in the elections.

195
00:19:36.233 --> 00:19:39.702
Seven is ready. Seven's on - go.

196
00:19:40.544 --> 00:19:43.483
<i>Eight thousand Estonians have returned</i>.
- Four and five. Two is ready. go!

197
00:19:43.546 --> 00:19:45.624
<i>The population of Estonia
has grown by 8.000 people.</i>

198
00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:47.335
<i>It needs to be worked on.</i>
- Seven. ready.

199
00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:51.069
<i>We need to invest more in research
and innovation...</i>

200
00:19:51.366 --> 00:19:54.241
I agree with what
has been said here before.

201
00:19:54.342 --> 00:19:56.764
that education is one of the great issues
- Put the titre!

202
00:19:56.832 --> 00:19:59.506
that will help us out
of this trap of mediocrity.

203
00:19:59.569 --> 00:20:01.186
Where does the money come from?

204
00:20:01.257 --> 00:20:03.139
Money comes from the state budget.
- Two. ready!

205
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.132
money comes from economic growth.

206
00:20:05.186 --> 00:20:07.077
and the reduction of bureaucracy.
- Now four!

207
00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:08.834
But why do we have bureaucracy?
- Five. go!

208
00:20:08.896 --> 00:20:11.866
You've been in the government. I haven't.
you should know it better.

209
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:16.749
I think the kind of false news.
the kind of intimidation

210
00:20:17.108 --> 00:20:20.155
that you. Mart and Kaja. both are doing.

211
00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:23.116
it can not be tolerated in any way.
- Six. ready. Six!

212
00:20:23.249 --> 00:20:25.397
This is the worst you can do
in Estonian society.

213
00:20:25.467 --> 00:20:28.936
There is no way to tolerate your policy!
- Three. Get ready!

214
00:20:29.038 --> 00:20:31.702
This is the worst you can do
in Estonian society.

215
00:20:31.764 --> 00:20:34.913
This is the worst thing you can do
in Estonian society. Exactly.

216
00:20:35.022 --> 00:20:38.655
You scare people...
- You are doing ethnic cleansing.

217
00:21:02.663 --> 00:21:06.139
The Reform Party and the Center Party
could now do the government together.

218
00:21:06.202 --> 00:21:07.764
they have more than 60 votes.

219
00:21:07.928 --> 00:21:11.358
In fact. there is one and the same party.
- Two buttocks on one butt.

220
00:21:11.506 --> 00:21:15.483
Look at this snowflake.
is that a damn party leader?

221
00:21:15.712 --> 00:21:19.499
The money-men
will never gather behind her.

222
00:21:19.762 --> 00:21:21.928
This chick would have been better...

223
00:21:23.812 --> 00:21:26.374
I am very pleased. but not only myself.

224
00:21:26.522 --> 00:21:29.342
but the whole party has done
a fantastic result.

225
00:21:29.725 --> 00:21:32.350
The conservative electorate has given

226
00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:35.209
a strong mandate to both.
us and the Pro Patria Union...

227
00:21:47.374 --> 00:21:52.272
We have been accused of separating people.
of inciting anger.

228
00:21:52.538 --> 00:21:54.643
and I don't know what else.

229
00:21:54.983 --> 00:21:58.052
Populists and radicals and fascists

230
00:21:58.129 --> 00:22:00.920
and nationalists
and what else have we all been?

231
00:22:01.212 --> 00:22:06.307
It's the same rhetoric that Donald Trump
has been hearing for years.

232
00:22:06.516 --> 00:22:08.498
So in that sense. we're doing a Trump.

233
00:22:08.568 --> 00:22:10.498
But we're also doing Trump
in another sense.

234
00:22:10.655 --> 00:22:13.233
What matters is what we think

235
00:22:13.342 --> 00:22:15.831
and without taking
our opinion into account.

236
00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:18.287
there can be no more politics in Estonia.

237
00:22:25.589 --> 00:22:29.886
Helme does not represent us...

238
00:22:31.364 --> 00:22:32.826
OPEN ESTONIA

239
00:22:35.614 --> 00:22:37.630
WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS

240
00:22:40.443 --> 00:22:44.286
WE ALSO HAVE RED LINES!

241
00:22:55.484 --> 00:22:58.492
IT IS JUST SO EMBARRASSING.

242
00:23:11.799 --> 00:23:13.857
Our Estonia!

243
00:23:15.877 --> 00:23:17.829
Our Estonia!

244
00:23:19.384 --> 00:23:20.829
Is it or isn't it?

245
00:23:22.963 --> 00:23:26.478
Is it ours or isn't it? Our Estonia!

246
00:23:28.713 --> 00:23:30.704
Our Estonia!

247
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:39.540
The Center Party and the cynical patriots
want to bring a party to government.

248
00:23:40.142 --> 00:23:45.423
a party whose leaders have threatened
to eliminate the constitutional order.

249
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:50.259
I believe that the rights of any national.

250
00:23:50.482 --> 00:23:54.040
sexual or religious minorities
should be protected!

251
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:10.134
It is sad that our people are divided
into right and wrong

252
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.751
because of their identity.

253
00:24:13.099 --> 00:24:15.499
But. no matter what. we will win!

254
00:24:25.511 --> 00:24:30.138
Government residence

255
00:25:04.118 --> 00:25:08.545
WHERE IS THE PRIME MINISTER'S RED LINE?

256
00:25:32.807 --> 00:25:36.342
DON'T SELL HUMAN RIGHTS FOR POWER!

257
00:25:44.926 --> 00:25:50.455
Yes to freedom. not to lies. That's right!
Contact the Reform Party with that.

258
00:25:51.127 --> 00:25:53.722
We'll contact you.
- No. contact the Reform Party.

259
00:25:54.132 --> 00:25:57.986
They fill the media with everyday lies.
- If you say so.

260
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:37.530
Square in front of Parliament

261
00:26:52.153 --> 00:26:57.133
I'm a half-Estonian half-Russian.
but I love everyone.

262
00:26:58.228 --> 00:27:03.025
Because love is the only thing
our people lack. Love!

263
00:27:03.197 --> 00:27:09.072
Are we ready? Let's say slowly -
yes to freedom!

264
00:27:09.252 --> 00:27:13.978
Let EKRE come to power! They are right.

265
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.478
Yes. yes. yes!
- No. no. no!

266
00:27:17.711 --> 00:27:21.619
Yes. yes. yes! EKRE and Pro Patria!

267
00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:28.697
EKRE to power!
- No. no. no!

268
00:27:29.219 --> 00:27:34.229
Be smart now. let them rule. You see!

269
00:27:35.357 --> 00:27:38.869
PARLIAMENT

270
00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:01.796
As a member
of the Government of the Republic.

271
00:28:02.212 --> 00:28:08.145
I am aware that I have a responsibility
to the Republic of Estonia

272
00:28:08.216 --> 00:28:10.672
and to my conscience.

273
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:13.980
I solemnly promise to remain faithful

274
00:28:14.051 --> 00:28:17.586
to the constitutional order
of the Republic of Estonia

275
00:28:17.978 --> 00:28:20.677
and dedicate my efforts

276
00:28:20.762 --> 00:28:24.664
to securing the well-being
and future of the Estonian people.

277
00:28:27.288 --> 00:28:30.243
SPEECH IS FREE

278
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.180
Minister of Foreign Trade
and Information Technology Marti Kuusik.

279
00:28:55.919 --> 00:28:58.435
Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu.

280
00:29:27.583 --> 00:29:30.231
ERR newsroom

281
00:29:30.441 --> 00:29:35.909
Hello. Thank you. I saw it. understood.

282
00:29:37.889 --> 00:29:40.487
Yes-yes! It arrived now.

283
00:29:40.738 --> 00:29:43.848
Yes! Exactly!

284
00:29:44.748 --> 00:29:48.206
Yeah. Yes. we'll do it. very good.

285
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:54.572
Throughout my previous professional life.
I have proven that I can do my job well.

286
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:59.878
when I approach a certain goal.
I get things done.

287
00:30:00.214 --> 00:30:03.042
And maybe that's the biggest reason

288
00:30:03.144 --> 00:30:08.066
why they really want to steer me
away from work.

289
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.065
Maybe we can take a piece
from the show "Ringvaade".

290
00:30:12.187 --> 00:30:14.956
where he talks about his wife
in the third person.

291
00:30:15.128 --> 00:30:16.550
Let's take a piece from there.

292
00:30:16.788 --> 00:30:19.581
Where the Prime Minister asked
whether the rumors about Kuusik

293
00:30:19.647 --> 00:30:22.088
as a perpetrator of domestic violence
were true.

294
00:30:22.955 --> 00:30:26.987
There. she comes out with a face
and then put in sync from here.

295
00:30:27.072 --> 00:30:29.322
I'll tell you then...
- Yeah. okay.

296
00:30:38.312 --> 00:30:40.976
Oh! Yes. it can be so long.

297
00:30:57.883 --> 00:31:00.319
Good evening! Newscast on Monday evening.

298
00:31:00.373 --> 00:31:01.554
Start!

299
00:31:02.288 --> 00:31:05.210
The second government of Prime Minister
Jüri Ratas started work today.

300
00:31:05.296 --> 00:31:08.679
Minister Marti Kuusik is suspected
of serious domestic violence.

301
00:31:10.757 --> 00:31:14.734
In recent months. Estonia has bought
more electricity than sold it.

302
00:31:17.038 --> 00:31:20.741
President Kersti Kaljulaid left
the Parliament hall as a sign of protest

303
00:31:20.819 --> 00:31:23.756
when Minister of Foreign Trade
and Information Technology.

304
00:31:23.819 --> 00:31:25.889
Marti Kuusik took the oath of office.

305
00:31:25.975 --> 00:31:28.553
President Kersti Kaljulaid
wore blue. black and white

306
00:31:28.667 --> 00:31:30.725
in support of freedom of the press...

307
00:31:30.812 --> 00:31:32.905
You could get the sports robot ready.

308
00:31:32.997 --> 00:31:36.740
I stand here in blue. black and white
and say that the word is free.

309
00:31:37.122 --> 00:31:41.522
But is it really? It's mainly in the hands
of our journalists themselves.

310
00:31:58.954 --> 00:32:03.822
The small town of Kuusalu

311
00:32:24.218 --> 00:32:26.003
Take the songbook...

312
00:32:27.342 --> 00:32:31.084
<i>...sang the woods and the sea
and the Estonian people.</i>

313
00:32:31.194 --> 00:32:35.764
<i>Went to play in the forest.
went to sing in the woods.</i>

314
00:32:35.917 --> 00:32:40.381
<i>Went to play in the forest.</i>

315
00:32:40.618 --> 00:32:44.444
<i>went to sing in the woods.</i>

316
00:32:44.831 --> 00:32:49.514
<i>Went with a song...</i>

317
00:32:52.716 --> 00:32:55.443
Nine's ready. Put nine on the air.

318
00:32:55.942 --> 00:33:00.245
<i>And Ove's on the air...
- Yes. nine's in...</i>

319
00:33:01.596 --> 00:33:05.403
<i>And seven's ready. Seven!</i>

320
00:33:08.363 --> 00:33:10.426
One is ready. One!

321
00:33:14.023 --> 00:33:20.325
The Estonian Song Festival was born
out of love for our country and language.

322
00:33:21.207 --> 00:33:26.325
Through this love.
our people became the Estonian people

323
00:33:26.567 --> 00:33:29.911
and our country became
the Republic of Estonia.

324
00:33:30.661 --> 00:33:32.543
By celebrating the song festival.

325
00:33:32.712 --> 00:33:36.364
we celebrate our mother tongue
and fatherland.

326
00:33:36.754 --> 00:33:39.395
so that we can bequeath them
to our children

327
00:33:39.622 --> 00:33:42.536
and last in the winds of eternity forever.

328
00:34:32.627 --> 00:34:37.340
"What fatherland?...
Now I love only my children's land."

329
00:34:37.505 --> 00:34:40.653
Friedrich Nietzsche
"Thus Spoke Zarathustra"

330
00:34:46.446 --> 00:34:49.270
President Konstantin Päts.
speaks in 1938

331
00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:52.520
Instead of the former large manors.

332
00:34:52.626 --> 00:34:55.012
you can now see
tens of thousands of free farms.

333
00:34:55.145 --> 00:34:58.098
who peacefully cultivate their land

334
00:34:58.238 --> 00:35:03.418
and participate as full citizens
in the reconstruction of their country.

335
00:35:07.528 --> 00:35:12.996
Where there were previously
empty meadows and bushes.

336
00:35:13.176 --> 00:35:17.754
large industries with thousands of people
have come to life.

337
00:35:18.245 --> 00:35:24.020
We have launched a new industry.
it is our oil shale

338
00:35:25.629 --> 00:35:32.543
and our land now gives us
various precious substances.

339
00:35:32.817 --> 00:35:38.918
which our scientists are currently
studying in their laboratories.

340
00:36:12.115 --> 00:36:15.458
I am deeply sorry and embarrassed

341
00:36:15.852 --> 00:36:19.208
that my generation
and generations older than me

342
00:36:19.512 --> 00:36:22.974
have put your future in such danger.

343
00:36:23.052 --> 00:36:27.372
Your life will not be as good
as it has been for me.

344
00:36:27.506 --> 00:36:29.302
Mihkel Kangur
geographer

345
00:36:29.505 --> 00:36:32.028
And what lies ahead

346
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:35.950
is only a suffering and violent future.

347
00:36:36.255 --> 00:36:40.138
There is not much we can do
to prevent this.

348
00:36:40.261 --> 00:36:42.419
since time is running out.

349
00:36:42.678 --> 00:36:44.505
THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING.
WHY AREN'T WE?

350
00:36:49.008 --> 00:36:51.258
We have a lot to learn from birds.

351
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:56.295
There are not many Estonian birds.
all birds are global.

352
00:36:56.483 --> 00:36:58.202
Marek Strandberg
scientist

353
00:36:58.396 --> 00:37:00.507
They have a bird's eye view of the world.

354
00:37:00.656 --> 00:37:04.466
Our swallow is also
a South African swallow.

355
00:37:04.968 --> 00:37:07.352
There are birds that live in Estonia

356
00:37:07.474 --> 00:37:10.211
as well as in the North Pole
and the South Pole.

357
00:37:10.524 --> 00:37:14.969
and understanding them shows us
that man must also be like a bird.

358
00:37:16.563 --> 00:37:22.883
<i>A beautiful distant planet
in the winds of the Milky Way.</i>

359
00:37:24.524 --> 00:37:30.250
<i>Long roads of light lead to it.</i>

360
00:37:32.072 --> 00:37:38.641
<i>Another mystery is
whether there is anyone?</i>

361
00:37:40.168 --> 00:37:46.008
<i>Waiting for us.
leaving tracks on the way.</i>

362
00:37:53.758 --> 00:37:58.516
<i>A beautiful distant planet. Ah...</i>

363
00:38:03.415 --> 00:38:07.766
<i>5-8-1-C. ah...</i>

364
00:38:12.954 --> 00:38:16.586
<i>I'm on my way. Ah...</i>

365
00:38:20.219 --> 00:38:25.649
Of course it's a very aggressive schedule.
it's very ambitious -

366
00:38:25.985 --> 00:38:32.172
building a 103 km tunnel between
Helsinki airport and lake Ülemiste.

367
00:38:32.394 --> 00:38:34.401
But on the other hand.

368
00:38:34.539 --> 00:38:41.000
CRSC has built 18.000 km
of railway tunnels in China alone.

369
00:38:41.226 --> 00:38:44.192
so building a hundred kilometers more
is not a big deal.

370
00:38:44.865 --> 00:38:47.394
<i>Beautiful distant planet.</i>

371
00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:52.558
<i>we still have time</i>

372
00:38:54.002 --> 00:39:01.214
<i>to reach you in the light of the stars.</i>

373
00:39:10.221 --> 00:39:14.089
<i>A beautiful distant strange planet...</i>

374
00:39:19.815 --> 00:39:25.276
The direction in which the world is moving
depends on our decisions.

375
00:39:28.776 --> 00:39:32.029
I urge you. I urge myself

376
00:39:32.166 --> 00:39:37.700
to have a sincere passion
for caring for the world.

377
00:39:38.622 --> 00:39:44.419
I want us young people
to think with our own heads.

378
00:39:44.724 --> 00:39:51.146
So that we do not listen to
what is being fed to us

379
00:39:51.597 --> 00:39:53.802
by large corporations.

380
00:39:54.599 --> 00:39:57.521
WE HAVE NO PLANET B

381
00:39:58.544 --> 00:40:04.529
I wish that we. young people.
would not care so much about money

382
00:40:04.817 --> 00:40:07.130
or our own well-being.

383
00:40:07.255 --> 00:40:12.544
but that the world would really become
even a little better

384
00:40:12.755 --> 00:40:16.982
as a result of our actions.

385
00:40:20.826 --> 00:40:23.208
WE HAVE ONE EARTH

386
00:40:23.708 --> 00:40:28.646
We are the first generation to realize
that we are destroying our planet

387
00:40:28.818 --> 00:40:31.505
and the last generation
who can make a difference.

388
00:40:39.482 --> 00:40:44.450
This concerns us all. and we are all
obliged to deal with it. Now.

389
00:40:47.527 --> 00:40:52.640
WATER AND AIR. TWO THINGS ON WHICH
LIFE DEPENDS. HAVE BECOME A TRASHCAN

390
00:41:24.729 --> 00:41:30.222
We want people in government to panic.

391
00:41:32.722 --> 00:41:36.026
It's no longer an option.
it's an obligation in order to survive.

392
00:41:37.276 --> 00:41:44.081
Yes to renewable energy!
No to oil shale!

393
00:41:44.518 --> 00:41:46.011
Louder!

394
00:41:46.378 --> 00:41:52.675
Yes to renewable energy!
No to oil shale!

395
00:41:52.841 --> 00:41:55.089
Raise the banners!

396
00:41:57.261 --> 00:42:04.956
Yes to renewable energy!
No to oil shale!...

397
00:42:13.465 --> 00:42:18.918
SAVE ESTONIA! GARBAGE OFF THE GROUND!
ANIMALS KEEP DYING OUT!

398
00:42:37.215 --> 00:42:41.426
<i>We move winding toward the sunset.</i>

399
00:42:41.731 --> 00:42:45.699
<i>by day we measure a vast stretch of road.</i>

400
00:42:46.105 --> 00:42:49.887
<i>We move winding toward the sunset.</i>

401
00:42:50.887 --> 00:42:55.300
<i>Our hearts are satisfied. we are glad.</i>

402
00:42:58.019 --> 00:43:01.831
<i>we all rejoice</i>

403
00:43:05.988 --> 00:43:12.535
<i>that in the footsteps of the sunset
a rejuvenating morning follows.</i>

404
00:43:13.005 --> 00:43:19.168
<i>that from the morning
a new sunny road begins.</i>

405
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:26.199
<i>That in the footsteps of the sunset
a rejuvenating morning follows.</i>

406
00:43:27.164 --> 00:43:33.801
<i>that from the morning
a new sunny road begins.</i>

407
00:43:43.783 --> 00:43:47.636
<i>Our faces are turned toward the sunset.</i>

408
00:43:47.941 --> 00:43:51.816
<i>our hearts are satisfied. we are glad</i>

409
00:43:52.488 --> 00:43:56.918
<i>that dawn follows neck and neck
in the footsteps of the sunset.</i>

410
00:43:57.082 --> 00:44:01.386
<i>even before it has time to die.</i>

411
00:44:05.465 --> 00:44:11.652
<i>That in the footsteps of the sunset
a rejuvenating morning follows.</i>

412
00:44:12.371 --> 00:44:18.605
<i>that from the morning
a new sunny road begins.</i>

413
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:26.902
<i>Beautiful is the land.
beautiful is the land.</i>

414
00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:34.113
<i>beautiful. beautiful.
beautiful is the land.</i>

415
00:44:35.012 --> 00:44:40.777
<i>beautiful is the land I love.</i>

416
00:45:01.338 --> 00:45:05.314
<i>We move winding toward the sunset.</i>

417
00:45:05.753 --> 00:45:09.792
<i>by day we measure a vast stretch of road.</i>

418
00:45:10.253 --> 00:45:14.487
<i>We move winding toward the sunset.</i>

419
00:45:14.839 --> 00:45:19.596
<i>our hearts are satisfied. we are glad.</i>

420
00:45:24.253 --> 00:45:30.346
<i>Beautiful is the land.
beautiful is the land.</i>

421
00:45:30.929 --> 00:45:37.088
<i>beautiful. beautiful.
beautiful is the land.</i>

422
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:43.487
<i>beautiful is the land.
beautiful is the land.</i>

423
00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:50.940
<i>beautiful. beautiful.
beautiful is the land.</i>

424
00:45:51.744 --> 00:45:58.159
<i>beautiful is the land I love.</i>

425
00:45:59.268 --> 00:46:04.307
<i>beautiful is the land</i>

426
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:13.151
<i>I love.</i>

427
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:24.928
"We know - the earth does not belong
to man. man belongs to the earth."

428
00:46:25.061 --> 00:46:28.358
Chief Seattle. 1854

429
00:46:35.982 --> 00:46:38.060
On Thursday. the cornerstone was laid

430
00:46:38.135 --> 00:46:40.600
for the railway
with the Central European gauge.

431
00:46:40.662 --> 00:46:42.951
which connects the Baltics with Poland.

432
00:46:43.052 --> 00:46:47.217
This week. the ministers of EKRE
have tried to give the impression.

433
00:46:47.459 --> 00:46:49.522
that there's something wrong in Estonia

434
00:46:49.717 --> 00:46:53.264
if a minister cannot kick the door open
and see what's inside?

435
00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:55.350
It is 13:05 in Tallinn...

436
00:46:55.428 --> 00:47:02.358
We saw a high-ranking national official
sacrificed for political reasons.

437
00:47:04.573 --> 00:47:08.459
Last week in Strasbourg.
the European Parliament voted

438
00:47:08.717 --> 00:47:11.241
that we have a climate disaster and...

439
00:47:11.366 --> 00:47:14.342
We will certainly
also be talking about climate

440
00:47:14.983 --> 00:47:19.764
if we can link it to some kind of scandal.
a specific case.

441
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.178
Look at what is happening in Estonia.
look at what is happening in Europe.

442
00:47:25.373 --> 00:47:30.858
Left-wing parties everywhere.
such as Democrats in America.

443
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:33.483
they have gone completely crazy.

444
00:47:33.592 --> 00:47:35.451
There is no common sense there.

445
00:47:35.522 --> 00:47:38.475
there are no more natural instincts.

446
00:47:38.616 --> 00:47:44.069
There is some kind of distorted brain.
some hallucinations.

447
00:47:45.569 --> 00:47:47.553
I completely condemn this.

448
00:47:48.858 --> 00:47:51.514
This is not a government position.

449
00:47:58.085 --> 00:48:02.975
Sõrve Peninsula. Saaremaa

450
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:25.967
You can just put the number in this box.

451
00:48:26.053 --> 00:48:29.779
We just need to know
how many people are here.

452
00:48:33.733 --> 00:48:38.631
KINGDOM OF TORGU XXVII
Approximate schedule

453
00:48:44.451 --> 00:48:48.076
Today. of course.
we are actually celebrating

454
00:48:48.236 --> 00:48:51.420
the 27th anniversary
of the coronation of the king.

455
00:48:51.925 --> 00:48:55.756
because what kingdom is it
without the crowned king.

456
00:48:56.015 --> 00:48:58.529
But he apologized for his health again.

457
00:48:58.842 --> 00:49:02.412
but this is important.
so I will read out his message:

458
00:49:03.529 --> 00:49:07.779
Good people of Sõrve
and friendly neighbors.

459
00:49:08.326 --> 00:49:10.811
Due to the loss
of the municipality's independence.

460
00:49:10.912 --> 00:49:12.799
the kingdom.
which has slept in the shadows.

461
00:49:12.862 --> 00:49:14.764
is now waking up more and more.

462
00:49:15.264 --> 00:49:18.217
In addition to the flag.
the kingdom now has a coat of arms.

463
00:49:18.292 --> 00:49:20.975
invented by the women of folk dance.

464
00:49:21.514 --> 00:49:25.514
We have our money. which was washed
with vodka by the king's deputy Valdek

465
00:49:25.623 --> 00:49:29.795
and now we also have our anthem.
for which we thank Õie and Peeter.

466
00:49:31.092 --> 00:49:35.217
I know for sure that our friends.
the Seto. also have an anthem.

467
00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:38.647
they established their kingdom
following our example two years later.

468
00:49:39.306 --> 00:49:41.240
There have been no more brave people.

469
00:49:41.391 --> 00:49:44.826
but both the kingdoms of TORGU and Seto
have become indestructible.

470
00:49:45.084 --> 00:49:47.779
because they live in the hearts
of their people.

471
00:49:52.459 --> 00:49:56.678
I. King Kirill of TORGU.
by the grace of Hänga Leevi.

472
00:49:56.748 --> 00:50:00.436
have the pleasure to greet
all the people of Saaremaa. Muhumaa

473
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:02.694
and. of course. the people of Sõrve.

474
00:50:04.904 --> 00:50:11.287
Community life has worked for as long
as we know humanity.

475
00:50:11.701 --> 00:50:13.427
Kaupo Vipp
Guardian of the Kingdom of TORGU

476
00:50:13.513 --> 00:50:16.818
Consequently. the community life
is something we can certainly rely on

477
00:50:16.904 --> 00:50:19.069
when this technocratic system collapses.

478
00:50:27.818 --> 00:50:33.083
Today. at the king's command.
the day is a little longer.

479
00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:36.333
The sun goes down later.

480
00:50:59.967 --> 00:51:01.958
Have you tried this?
- No.

481
00:51:02.036 --> 00:51:03.751
No?
- Where are you from?

482
00:51:03.881 --> 00:51:05.982
I'm from everywhere.

483
00:51:06.138 --> 00:51:10.607
I'm from Big-Sõrve.
this side of the Nasva River.

484
00:51:48.585 --> 00:51:50.763
THE EARTH SUFFERS FROM CONSUMPTION

485
00:51:50.904 --> 00:51:54.310
We are here today to draw attention

486
00:51:54.447 --> 00:51:57.872
to the global climate
and environmental disaster.

487
00:51:59.065 --> 00:52:02.904
Many rural areas
have already become uninhabitable.

488
00:52:03.542 --> 00:52:06.732
In Estonia. the number of days
when the land is covered with snow

489
00:52:06.911 --> 00:52:09.885
has decreased by an average
of thirty-three days a year.

490
00:52:10.169 --> 00:52:14.229
Excessive consumption
and careless use of natural resources

491
00:52:14.354 --> 00:52:16.127
have brought us to the brink of disaster.

492
00:52:22.169 --> 00:52:24.849
There was no snow this year.

493
00:52:25.974 --> 00:52:29.864
The Year of the Earth Pig
ended with a spectacular concert

494
00:52:29.989 --> 00:52:32.778
and the new Year of the Rat was welcomed.

495
00:52:35.168 --> 00:52:37.246
There was a lot of talk
about China in general.

496
00:52:37.588 --> 00:52:39.895
about the growth
of its economic influence.

497
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:45.387
and about a new virus that will soon
make the whole world stand still.

498
00:52:48.092 --> 00:52:52.598
How do we know what nature wants?
How do we know that?

499
00:52:57.730 --> 00:52:59.778
Nature itself is the will.

500
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:18.293
March 22. 2020
