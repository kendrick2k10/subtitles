00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:45.610
<i>Welcome to Boston for
the 2017 AFC Championship game</i>

4
00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:49.049
<i>between the New England Patriots
and the Pittsburgh Steelers.</i>

5
00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:50.702
<i>New England wins the toss</i>

6
00:00:50.876 --> 00:00:52.878
<i>here at Gillette Stadium
in Foxborough. Massachusetts.</i>

7
00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.055
Game'’s about to start!

8
00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.709
<i>These two teams
fighting for the right
to play down in Houston.</i>

9
00:00:57.883 --> 00:01:01.496
Hey. game'’s about to start.
Everyone to your spots.

10
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.151
I got my tea.
Somebody get the guacamole.

11
00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.066
- We didn'’t make guacamole.
- Chips with no guac!

12
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.677
I can'’t believe
- we have to do this.
- It'’s our tradition.

13
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:10.722
Trish. you'’re in
the dining room.
Get the magazine.

14
00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:12.072
You were reading the magazine.

15
00:01:12.246 --> 00:01:13.812
I can'’t see from in here!

16
00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:15.162
- There you go.
- Yeah. Oh. thanks.

17
00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:16.815
- I'’m going to my chair.
- Betty!

18
00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:18.252
What?
I'’m standing next to it.

19
00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:20.167
Just get on the ladder.

20
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:21.994
- Get up on the ladder!
- All right! Here I am.

21
00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.952
Ladder!

22
00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:24.171
I'’m on the ladder.

23
00:01:24.345 --> 00:01:26.042
I think
it'’s a fun tradition.

24
00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:28.044
Yeah. '’cause you'’re sitting
on the couch. drinking tea.

25
00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:30.090
Yeah. sipping.
Drinking is vulgar.
I sip.

26
00:01:30.264 --> 00:01:31.743
Lou. I have to tell you.

27
00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:33.528
this really doesn'’t affect
the outcome of the game.

28
00:01:33.702 --> 00:01:35.182
It'’s just a silly superstition.

29
00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:36.879
Well. what happened
in week eight?

30
00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:39.142
Well. I was standing
on the ladder
fixing a lightbulb

31
00:01:39.316 --> 00:01:40.883
that was flickering
and driving me crazy.

32
00:01:41.057 --> 00:01:43.538
Exactly. You were up
on the ladder at kickoff.

33
00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:46.236
Trish was in the dining room
reading her magazine.

34
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.977
Maura was drinking tea--Sipping.

35
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:50.240
And I spilled the chips.
And what happened?

36
00:01:50.414 --> 00:01:51.589
We beat the Bills.

37
00:01:51.763 --> 00:01:53.417
We killed the Bills.

38
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:55.027
We killed the Bills.

39
00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:56.464
Why chance it?
She'’s got a point.

40
00:01:56.638 --> 00:01:58.248
Oh! There'’s Tom.

41
00:01:58.422 --> 00:02:00.207
[Lou] Oh.
what a beautiful man.

42
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:01.730
Gorgeous.[Maura] Oh. my goodness.

43
00:02:01.904 --> 00:02:02.861
He'’s so well-hydrated.

44
00:02:04.472 --> 00:02:06.691
I prefer Gronkowski
these days.

45
00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:09.172
We know. Trish.
We'’ve all read
your Gronk erotica.

46
00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:10.565
It'’s not erotica.

47
00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.567
It'’s fan fiction.

48
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:14.351
Very sexy fan fiction.

49
00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:15.700
No kidding.

50
00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:16.745
Oh. my God!

51
00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.181
Oh! Get her a new tea!

52
00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:20.009
- I was distracted.
- Trish. get her a new tea!

53
00:02:20.183 --> 00:02:21.532
- Sorry. guys!
- It'’s almost kickoff!

54
00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:23.926
- It'’s not hot!
- Just use the faucet!

55
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.884
I-I prefer it hot. Okay?

56
00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:28.409
- Maura. I'’ve got your tea.
- Lou! The chips!

57
00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:30.062
- Oh. shit. the chips!
- Kickoff in two. one--

58
00:02:30.237 --> 00:02:31.151
<i>It'’s kickoff!</i>

59
00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:37.461
Well--Oh. nice work!

60
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:45.426
<i>Touchback.
Tom Brady comes out.</i>

61
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.212
<i>Once again.
33rd postseason appearance.</i>

62
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.606
<i>The hold by Ryan Allen.</i>

63
00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:54.870
<i>Cardona snaps it back.
The kick is good.</i>

64
00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:56.698
- All right! Okay!
- Brady completes.

65
00:02:56.872 --> 00:02:58.569
All right. Okay.
- We'’re on the board.
- That'’s good.

66
00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:07.143
Third and long!
This is our song!

67
00:03:07.317 --> 00:03:09.885
Third and long!
This is our song!

68
00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:11.495
Yes!

69
00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:22.985
<i>♪ We'’ve got it all
In store for you♪</i>

70
00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.380
<i>♪ From the Berkshires
To the shore♪</i>

71
00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:29.774
<i>♪ Mayflower Auto Mart and more ♪</i>

72
00:03:29.948 --> 00:03:31.211
Oh. man!

73
00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:33.387
She'’s new. She is pretty.

74
00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:35.650
Oh. she'’s just
a knockoff of you.

75
00:03:35.824 --> 00:03:37.826
You'’re the original
Mayflower Girl.

76
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.307
You'’re just as beautiful now
as you were back then.

77
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:41.960
- Oh. God. Thank you.
- Yes.

78
00:03:42.134 --> 00:03:44.136
You know what it cost me
to look like this?

79
00:03:44.311 --> 00:03:45.268
A fortune.

80
00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:51.883
- Give '’em the curse.
- Okay.

81
00:03:54.538 --> 00:03:55.800
Hands!

82
00:03:55.974 --> 00:03:57.498
- <i>Third and goal.
- Breath!</i>

83
00:03:57.672 --> 00:03:59.108
<i>A hike to the 19...</i>

84
00:04:08.073 --> 00:04:09.858
Okay. a toast.

85
00:04:10.032 --> 00:04:12.861
To the man who brought us
all here: Tom Brady.

86
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.692
Who never gives up.
no matter what he'’s up against.

87
00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:22.653
May the hand of fate
continue to bless him
with perfect spirals

88
00:04:22.827 --> 00:04:26.178
and the confidence
to stand tall in the pocket.

89
00:04:27.441 --> 00:04:28.964
- To Tom.
- To Tom!

90
00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:31.183
- To Tom.
- To Tom.

91
00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:34.883
To Tom!
And to our quarterback.

92
00:04:35.057 --> 00:04:36.319
the woman
who brought us together

93
00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:37.668
and made this our tradition.

94
00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:39.453
No. I didn'’t plan
on all this.

95
00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:48.984
Here we go.
This is it.

96
00:04:49.158 --> 00:04:52.901
Five. four. three. two. one.

97
00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:56.339
Tom Brady!

98
00:04:58.036 --> 00:05:00.212
We'’re going
- to the Super Bowl!
- Good job.

99
00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:02.780
We did it![sighs] Oh. boy.

100
00:05:04.216 --> 00:05:06.871
So. I suppose

101
00:05:07.045 --> 00:05:10.701
that gives us two weeks
to plan the Super Bowl party.

102
00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.747
Shall we all
- bring appetizers?
- Why not?

103
00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:14.052
Can I bring Carl?

104
00:05:14.226 --> 00:05:15.619
You know.
things are getting serious.

105
00:05:15.793 --> 00:05:17.839
Who is he again?[Betty] The handsome one.

106
00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:18.970
They'’re all handsome.

107
00:05:19.144 --> 00:05:20.972
What if we went?

108
00:05:21.146 --> 00:05:24.106
Oh. Trish.
you fall in love faster
than any other human on Earth.

109
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.891
Well. we can'’t all be
with the same man
for 50 years. Betty.

110
00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:28.153
Fifty-one.

111
00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.720
Let'’s all go
to the Super Bowl.

112
00:05:29.894 --> 00:05:32.419
Oh. no. Lou.
we'’ve looked into this.

113
00:05:32.593 --> 00:05:34.029
We-- We can'’t afford it.

114
00:05:34.203 --> 00:05:37.772
No. the tickets. the hotels.
it'’s too expensive.

115
00:05:37.946 --> 00:05:40.122
Two years ago.
I could'’ve paid
for us all to go.

116
00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:43.560
But I divorced Ralph
two weeks before the playoffs.[Betty] Oh. geez.

117
00:05:43.734 --> 00:05:45.214
Boy. do I regret that.

118
00:05:45.388 --> 00:05:46.998
- The divorce?
- No. he was terrible.

119
00:05:47.172 --> 00:05:49.131
But the game was amazing.

120
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:51.829
Maura!

121
00:05:52.003 --> 00:05:53.570
Oh. Maura.

122
00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.878
Oh. I'’m sorry.
I'’m sorry.

123
00:05:57.052 --> 00:05:59.228
It'’s just that every time
I hear that word "divorce."

124
00:05:59.402 --> 00:06:01.535
I just think of Francisco.
You know?

125
00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:02.927
Oh. Maura. No. no.

126
00:06:03.101 --> 00:06:04.973
Your husband
didn'’t divorce you.

127
00:06:05.147 --> 00:06:06.235
He died.

128
00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:07.758
It'’s the same thing.

129
00:06:07.932 --> 00:06:10.674
I'’m serious.
Let'’s go to the Super Bowl.

130
00:06:10.848 --> 00:06:12.981
The Super Bowl is no place
for four old women.

131
00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:14.939
This could be Tom'’s last one.

132
00:06:15.113 --> 00:06:16.288
He'’s almost 40.

133
00:06:16.463 --> 00:06:18.290
That'’s like 80 in people years.

134
00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:20.989
Yeah. we'’re 80
- in people years.
- Exactly!

135
00:06:21.163 --> 00:06:23.557
If Tom Brady can make it
to the Super Bowl.

136
00:06:23.731 --> 00:06:25.385
so can we.

137
00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:27.865
I'’d like to clarify.
I'’m not in my 80s.

138
00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:29.171
Neither am I.

139
00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:30.868
<i>...on this
momentous occasion.</i>

140
00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:32.957
<i>We are gonna do
something insane
for our Pats Nation.</i>

141
00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:36.091
Oh. it'’s Nat and Pat.
I love those guys.[Pat] <i>That'’s right.</i>

142
00:06:36.265 --> 00:06:38.920
<i>We'’re gonna have
a Super Bowl ticket giveaway. Aw. baby!</i>

143
00:06:39.094 --> 00:06:42.880
<i>Our four lucky fans
will get to travel
down to Houston</i>

144
00:06:43.054 --> 00:06:46.318
<i>to see the Pats
take on the Falcons.</i>

145
00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:48.712
<i>Just call the hotline. Call the hotline.
leave us a message.</i>

146
00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:50.322
<i>Tell us your story.</i>

147
00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:51.715
<i>Explain to us why
you deserve those tickets</i>

148
00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:53.282
<i>better than anybody else. Yeah.</i>

149
00:06:53.456 --> 00:06:54.675
<i>And we'’re gonna announce
the winner</i>

150
00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:56.198
<i>to our listeners
at the Super Bowl.</i>

151
00:06:56.372 --> 00:06:58.156
- That'’s how we go!
- It'’s a numbers game.

152
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.549
<i>This is not a numbers game.</i>

153
00:06:59.723 --> 00:07:01.029
<i>So don'’t leave us
a thousand messages.</i>

154
00:07:01.203 --> 00:07:02.334
<i>We don'’t want '’em. Please!</i>

155
00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:04.336
<i>We just wanna hear
your story.</i>

156
00:07:04.511 --> 00:07:05.947
<i>And who knows?</i>

157
00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:09.167
<i>Maybe we'’ll see you
in Houston! Houston!</i>

158
00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:13.258
See? He said
the best story wins.

159
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.043
We'’ve got a great story.

160
00:07:15.217 --> 00:07:17.741
We'’re the biggest
Pats fans there are.

161
00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:19.613
We love Tom Brady.

162
00:07:19.787 --> 00:07:22.093
And we'’re all
over 80 years old!

163
00:07:22.267 --> 00:07:23.443
I'’m 75.

164
00:07:23.617 --> 00:07:27.055
So. let'’s experience
a Super Bowl.

165
00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.710
Because this might be
our last chance.

166
00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:32.539
- God. that'’s morbid.
- Well. we gotta work
with what we got.

167
00:07:32.713 --> 00:07:34.715
We'’re gonna do this.
Bring it in.

168
00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:36.107
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Bring it. bring it.

169
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:37.457
- Yes. Oh. yes.
- Yeah. I'’m in.

170
00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:38.719
Super Bowl on three.

171
00:07:38.893 --> 00:07:42.853
One. two. three.
Super Bowl!

172
00:07:43.027 --> 00:07:45.987
Hello. my name is Betty--
Elizabeth Bachman.

173
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:49.077
Look. I crunched the numbers
and based on your viewership.

174
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:54.256
my friends and I have
about a .00013% chance here.

175
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.911
So. I realize that
the probability

176
00:07:57.085 --> 00:08:00.131
of me winning this contest
is very. very low...[Betty'’s husband] Honey!

177
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:05.833
...but I used to be a professor
of applied mathematics at MIT.

178
00:08:06.007 --> 00:08:08.749
back when there were
only two other women
in the whole department.

179
00:08:08.923 --> 00:08:11.534
so I'’m used to
the odds being against me.

180
00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:13.231
Honey?
I have to run to class.

181
00:08:13.405 --> 00:08:14.711
Have you seen my watch?

182
00:08:14.885 --> 00:08:16.539
It'’s on the mantel
over the fireplace.

183
00:08:16.713 --> 00:08:17.888
You'’re also gonna need pants.

184
00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:19.542
Pants? Oh.

185
00:08:19.716 --> 00:08:22.153
Right.
What would I do without you?

186
00:08:22.327 --> 00:08:23.459
I just really need
this trip.

187
00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:26.244
Thank you very much.

188
00:08:27.898 --> 00:08:30.379
Oh. What do you think
of my-- my paper?

189
00:08:30.553 --> 00:08:32.860
I'’m gonna submit it
to the journal.

190
00:08:34.557 --> 00:08:37.342
Look. I love
your principal points. I do.

191
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.910
but the whole paper right now
is rather confusing.

192
00:08:40.084 --> 00:08:42.086
And you can'’t expect
people to understand

193
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.525
unless you weave
the concepts together
a bit better and--

194
00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:46.830
Pants.

195
00:08:47.004 --> 00:08:48.397
Yep. pants. Right.

196
00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:50.921
Hi. My name is Maura.

197
00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:54.011
and my friends and I
are die-hard Pats fans.

198
00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:57.319
Which wasn'’t always the case
growing up in Oregon.

199
00:08:57.493 --> 00:08:59.843
where my mother
was a lumberjack--That'’s great.

200
00:09:00.017 --> 00:09:01.453
but if we want
the advantage here.

201
00:09:01.628 --> 00:09:03.281
it has to sound like
a real story.

202
00:09:03.455 --> 00:09:06.458
So let'’s keep it believable.
Right?

203
00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:08.504
- All right. Sure. Maura.
- Okay.

204
00:09:08.678 --> 00:09:10.201
But she really was
a lumberjack.

205
00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:12.334
Being bullied in
elementary school was hard.

206
00:09:12.508 --> 00:09:14.684
And then when
middle school came.
things got much worse.

207
00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:16.294
Much. much worse.

208
00:09:16.468 --> 00:09:19.559
And my mom started
picking on me too--Uh-- Uh--

209
00:09:19.733 --> 00:09:21.299
Don'’t make it so sad.

210
00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:24.955
It'’s about the best story wins.
not the saddest story.

211
00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:26.174
Okay?

212
00:09:27.088 --> 00:09:28.089
Thank you.

213
00:09:28.263 --> 00:09:29.220
Hello?

214
00:09:29.394 --> 00:09:31.919
Yes.
Uh. my name is Maura.

215
00:09:32.093 --> 00:09:35.400
and my three friends
and I are dying.
Thank you.

216
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.620
Okay. Bye-bye.

217
00:09:37.794 --> 00:09:40.188
We'’re-- We'’re dying
to go to the Super Bowl.

218
00:09:40.971 --> 00:09:42.669
- Oh. right.
- Yeah.

219
00:09:42.843 --> 00:09:44.714
- Oopsie.
- Mmm.

220
00:09:44.888 --> 00:09:45.846
Yeah.

221
00:09:46.455 --> 00:09:47.891
Hey. Maura.

222
00:09:48.065 --> 00:09:49.806
Thank you for including me
in all of this.

223
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.068
This is a lot of fun.

224
00:09:51.242 --> 00:09:52.853
Oh. good.

225
00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:55.682
Hey. do you think
you could round up
some more residents?

226
00:09:55.856 --> 00:09:59.729
Because some of
these performances
aren'’t helping our odds.

227
00:09:59.903 --> 00:10:01.035
You got it.

228
00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:02.863
Thanks. Mick.

229
00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:04.821
<i>I mean. this guy
is like Caesar. No. he'’s perfect.</i>

230
00:10:04.995 --> 00:10:06.431
<i>And he'’s like Genghis Khan.</i>

231
00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.783
"My friends and I
are die-hard"-- No. no.

232
00:10:09.957 --> 00:10:15.179
"My best friends and I
are die-hard Pats fans.

233
00:10:15.353 --> 00:10:19.183
We'’re all ladies over 80
who love Tom Brady.

234
00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:25.102
Twenty years ago.
we didn'’t know anything"--

235
00:10:25.276 --> 00:10:26.321
No. no. no.

236
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:29.454
"It was 16 years ago.

237
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.153
<i>I'’d just finished
my last round of chemo.</i>

238
00:10:32.327 --> 00:10:35.678
<i>and my three best friends
had come over to cheer me up."</i>

239
00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:37.245
How about some TV?

240
00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:38.550
Mmm.

241
00:10:41.466 --> 00:10:43.033
<i>So third down and ten now.</i>

242
00:10:43.207 --> 00:10:45.557
<i>Big play for the Patriots.</i> I can'’t change the channels.

243
00:10:45.732 --> 00:10:47.995
Oh. I can do it.

244
00:10:50.998 --> 00:10:52.303
Yeah. it'’s not working.

245
00:10:52.477 --> 00:10:54.436
Remote'’s been acting funny.

246
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.567
I got it.

247
00:10:55.742 --> 00:10:57.004
<i>Shaun Ellis. 92...</i>

248
00:10:57.178 --> 00:10:58.266
<i>...was carrying...</i> Oh!

249
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.528
What do I do?
What do I do?

250
00:10:59.702 --> 00:11:01.922
- Don'’t hit it.
- I already hit it.

251
00:11:02.096 --> 00:11:03.010
Unplug it.

252
00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:04.141
Hold on.

253
00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:05.360
<i>Two minutes left in this game.</i>

254
00:11:05.534 --> 00:11:07.188
<i>Drew Bledsoe is out.</i>

255
00:11:07.362 --> 00:11:09.233
<i>They'’re gonna have to go
with their backup QB.</i>

256
00:11:09.407 --> 00:11:12.280
<i>Tom Brady. the second-year
quarterback from
the University of Michigan.</i>

257
00:11:12.454 --> 00:11:13.890
Who'’s that?

258
00:11:14.064 --> 00:11:16.110
<i>I think anybody could tell
by looking at Bledsoe...</i>

259
00:11:16.284 --> 00:11:17.459
He is cute.

260
00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:18.808
Oh. I'’ll watch this.

261
00:11:20.636 --> 00:11:22.072
I can turn myself down.

262
00:11:23.944 --> 00:11:26.424
<i>"Maybe it was luck.
maybe it was destiny.</i>

263
00:11:26.598 --> 00:11:28.383
<i>but at that moment.</i>

264
00:11:28.557 --> 00:11:32.256
<i>the Patriots'’
backup quarterback
got called off the bench."</i>

265
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.171
<i>I think
that has to be so difficult.</i>

266
00:11:34.345 --> 00:11:35.782
<i>Oh. my God.</i>

267
00:11:35.956 --> 00:11:37.392
<i>"We eventually
got the remote working.</i>

268
00:11:37.566 --> 00:11:39.916
<i>and one week of football
became two."</i>

269
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.659
You know. for a game
where a bunch of guys
just smash into each other.

270
00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:45.139
it'’s really very complicated.

271
00:11:45.313 --> 00:11:46.575
There are so many patterns.

272
00:11:46.749 --> 00:11:48.403
and if you analyze the data.
you will find--

273
00:11:48.577 --> 00:11:50.710
We'’re just starting
to enjoy it. Betty.

274
00:11:50.884 --> 00:11:52.189
Don'’t make it about math.

275
00:11:52.363 --> 00:11:53.408
Oh. Okay.

276
00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:56.498
<i>"And two weeks
became a season."</i>

277
00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:03.810
<i>"Tom and the Patriots
went on to win
the Super Bowl that year.</i>

278
00:12:03.984 --> 00:12:06.987
<i>And I. well. I'’m still here.
thanks to my team."</i>

279
00:12:07.161 --> 00:12:09.946
And to Lou.
our quarterback.

280
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.687
You didn'’t!

281
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:14.864
<i>"And just like that.
we had a new tradition.</i>

282
00:12:15.038 --> 00:12:18.694
<i>That'’s why
it would mean the world to us
to win these tickets."</i>

283
00:12:18.868 --> 00:12:20.478
<i>What are we talking about?</i>

284
00:12:20.652 --> 00:12:22.132
<i>All right. Pat.
Look. I'’m glad you asked.</i>

285
00:12:22.306 --> 00:12:24.526
<i>Tonight is the end
of our ticket giveaway.</i>

286
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.094
<i>and we have received
a record number of submissions.</i>

287
00:12:27.268 --> 00:12:29.444
<i>But. hey. look. you still got
as about a good a chance</i>

288
00:12:29.618 --> 00:12:31.968
<i>as being the 199th draft pick</i>

289
00:12:32.142 --> 00:12:33.622
<i>and going on to become</i>

290
00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:36.103
<i>the four-time. soon to be
five-time. Super Bowl champ.</i>

291
00:12:36.277 --> 00:12:37.887
<i>We need one
for the thumb here.</i>

292
00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:40.020
<i>Or you could still try
and buy your tickets online.</i>

293
00:12:40.194 --> 00:12:41.891
<i>but for four tickets.
you'’d have to sell your car.</i>

294
00:12:42.065 --> 00:12:43.675
<i>Well. not your car. Yeah.</i>

295
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.373
<i>My car'’s garbage.</i> My--

296
00:12:45.547 --> 00:12:46.940
<i>In your case...</i>

297
00:12:47.114 --> 00:12:49.203
"My best friends and I
are die-hard Pa"--

298
00:12:49.377 --> 00:12:51.248
This isn'’t gonna work.

299
00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:54.599
Oh. what do I do. Tom?

300
00:13:01.563 --> 00:13:02.782
What do I do?

301
00:13:06.742 --> 00:13:08.222
Let'’s go.

302
00:13:19.363 --> 00:13:21.322
<i>CarMax of Andover.
how can I help you?</i>

303
00:13:21.496 --> 00:13:23.324
Lou. what'’s going on?

304
00:13:23.498 --> 00:13:25.065
You'’re acting very strange. Lou.

305
00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:26.544
Just keep your eyes shut.

306
00:13:26.718 --> 00:13:28.851
Lou. I'’ve got to
get home before dinner.

307
00:13:29.025 --> 00:13:30.505
It'’s craps night.

308
00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:32.028
You'’ve got
your own house. Maura.

309
00:13:32.202 --> 00:13:34.030
Why are you still living
in a retirement center?

310
00:13:34.204 --> 00:13:35.815
Frank loved it very much.

311
00:13:36.598 --> 00:13:37.947
Okay. look.

312
00:13:38.121 --> 00:13:42.299
Oh! I love presents.
I love presents.

313
00:13:42.473 --> 00:13:43.474
- Whoo!
- Oh!

314
00:13:43.648 --> 00:13:45.128
Oh. my gosh.
What is happening?

315
00:13:45.302 --> 00:13:47.565
I wanted it to be a surprise.

316
00:13:47.739 --> 00:13:50.177
but all they had
were gender reveal boxes.

317
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:51.482
Who'’s having a baby?

318
00:13:51.656 --> 00:13:53.180
No one.

319
00:13:53.354 --> 00:13:56.183
It'’s not a gender reveal.
It'’s just a reveal.

320
00:13:56.357 --> 00:13:57.184
Of what?

321
00:14:00.013 --> 00:14:02.015
We won the tickets.
We'’re going to the Super Bowl.

322
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:04.104
- Oh. my God!
- Oh. my God!
These are tickets.

323
00:14:04.278 --> 00:14:05.932
How did that happen?
How did that happen?

324
00:14:06.106 --> 00:14:08.978
Teamwork. I just did
what Tommy would do.

325
00:14:09.152 --> 00:14:12.155
Who cares how it happened?
We'’re going to the Super Bowl!

326
00:14:12.329 --> 00:14:13.678
Oh. my God![Betty] Oh. my God!

327
00:14:15.158 --> 00:14:16.899
<i>Welcome back to</i> Pats Nation.

328
00:14:17.073 --> 00:14:19.336
<i>The Super Bowl
is only three days away.</i>

329
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.557
<i>and I am more excited
about this than my own wedding.</i>

330
00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:25.255
<i>I'’m much more excited about it
than I was about your wedding.</i>

331
00:14:26.822 --> 00:14:29.433
No. Carl.
I did not agree that
we could see other people.

332
00:14:29.607 --> 00:14:31.131
That'’s not dating.

333
00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:33.873
That'’s cheating.
and I'’m done talking about it.

334
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:37.093
I do not want to talk to you.

335
00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:41.576
I'’m not interested
in anything you have to say.

336
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.100
Wow. this chapter
is really good.

337
00:14:44.274 --> 00:14:45.493
Oh. it'’s so steamy.

338
00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:47.147
No. it'’s not finished.

339
00:14:48.104 --> 00:14:50.324
No. Not you. Carl.

340
00:14:51.064 --> 00:14:53.196
With you. it is finished.

341
00:14:54.284 --> 00:14:56.678
Oh. Lou. I need a hug.

342
00:14:56.852 --> 00:14:58.419
I need a hug.

343
00:15:01.074 --> 00:15:02.249
Oh. baby.

344
00:15:02.423 --> 00:15:04.207
You'’re too good
for that one anyway.

345
00:15:04.381 --> 00:15:06.731
Oh. God. I'’m just...

346
00:15:11.084 --> 00:15:13.216
Betty'’s right. I-I'’m--

347
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.088
I have to stop
falling in love.

348
00:15:15.262 --> 00:15:18.091
No. You can fall in love.

349
00:15:18.265 --> 00:15:21.311
Just maybe wait till
you'’ve known them
more than a week.

350
00:15:23.531 --> 00:15:25.011
Maybe I just stay home.

351
00:15:25.185 --> 00:15:26.490
And mope around? No.

352
00:15:26.664 --> 00:15:28.492
We'’re going to the Super Bowl

353
00:15:28.666 --> 00:15:31.017
to enjoy men
the way the Romans did:

354
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:34.368
sweaty.
piled on top of one another.

355
00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:35.760
Tight pants.

356
00:15:36.979 --> 00:15:39.155
Okay.

357
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.117
So this one'’s
for your blood pressure.
It says take twice a day.

358
00:15:44.291 --> 00:15:46.032
And this one'’s for you
to go to sleep.

359
00:15:46.206 --> 00:15:49.209
so it'’s very important
you only take it
before bed. all right?

360
00:15:50.471 --> 00:15:52.125
I-- I'’m sorry. What?

361
00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:54.736
This one is for
your blood pressure.

362
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.564
Twice a day. okay?

363
00:15:56.738 --> 00:15:58.566
And this one
is to help you sleep.

364
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.742
It'’s important
to take sleep seriously.

365
00:16:00.916 --> 00:16:04.006
But only take it
when you'’re ready for bed.
okay? Because...

366
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.313
All right. let me know
if you need anything else.

367
00:16:13.842 --> 00:16:17.019
Oh. before you leave.
have you finished
making the corrections?

368
00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:20.283
Honey. you really need
to take another pass at it.

369
00:16:20.457 --> 00:16:23.069
I mean. you need to
add your own voice.

370
00:16:23.243 --> 00:16:25.332
Well. you know my voice
better than I do.

371
00:16:25.506 --> 00:16:27.508
No. no. no. I don'’t.
I never did.

372
00:16:28.726 --> 00:16:30.119
- Listen to me.
- Okay.

373
00:16:30.293 --> 00:16:31.773
You can do it.

374
00:16:32.687 --> 00:16:33.949
Okay. I think so.

375
00:16:34.123 --> 00:16:35.124
Okay.

376
00:16:38.736 --> 00:16:40.216
Mind if I come in?

377
00:16:40.956 --> 00:16:42.479
I see your bags are packed.

378
00:16:44.307 --> 00:16:45.613
So where you headed?

379
00:16:46.353 --> 00:16:48.094
Super Bowl.

380
00:16:48.268 --> 00:16:49.965
- Super Bowl. Really?
- Yeah.

381
00:16:50.139 --> 00:16:51.314
- No. you'’re kidding?
- Mm-mmm.

382
00:16:51.488 --> 00:16:52.533
Oh. man.

383
00:16:52.707 --> 00:16:53.969
You know.
I used to play football.

384
00:16:54.143 --> 00:16:55.101
- High school. Yeah.
- Mmm?

385
00:16:55.275 --> 00:16:56.363
I was a wingback.

386
00:16:56.537 --> 00:16:58.017
A little undersized.

387
00:16:58.191 --> 00:17:00.280
but the coach always said
I had great feet.

388
00:17:00.454 --> 00:17:03.413
My husband always said
that I had great feet.

389
00:17:03.587 --> 00:17:06.721
- Mmm.
- But he just
really liked feet.

390
00:17:13.249 --> 00:17:19.038
I heard that he passed away.

391
00:17:19.212 --> 00:17:20.561
Was it last year?

392
00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:23.085
- Yeah.
- Oh.

393
00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:24.260
Yeah.

394
00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:27.133
My wife. uh.
she passed away too.

395
00:17:27.307 --> 00:17:28.786
Oh. I'’m so sorry.

396
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.267
- I'’m so sorry.
- You know.
these things happen.

397
00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:34.488
Hey.

398
00:17:35.924 --> 00:17:40.276
If you need someone
to accompany you
to the Super Bowl...

399
00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:43.236
Thank you so much.

400
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.673
but I'’m already
going with friends. Thank you.

401
00:17:47.327 --> 00:17:50.417
But. hey. there is a lot
going on in this place

402
00:17:50.591 --> 00:17:52.027
- that you should explore.
- Mm-hmm. Yep.

403
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:53.594
There'’s-- No. really.

404
00:17:53.768 --> 00:17:56.901
There'’s pool aerobics.
There'’s. um...

405
00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.121
There'’s dancing.

406
00:17:59.295 --> 00:18:01.210
- There'’s game night.
- Yeah.

407
00:18:01.384 --> 00:18:03.995
- Uh. lunch.
- Yeah.

408
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.214
Lately. I'’ve...

409
00:18:07.173 --> 00:18:10.176
been realizing that
it'’s less about what you do.

410
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.570
more about
who you do it with. you know?

411
00:18:14.397 --> 00:18:16.660
I look around this place. and...

412
00:18:21.883 --> 00:18:25.365
you'’re the only one
I really wanna be around.
you know?

413
00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:28.368
It seems like you got it
all figured out and...

414
00:18:37.072 --> 00:18:38.378
Talking to myself.

415
00:18:41.468 --> 00:18:43.383
Stop honking.
Betty hates it.

416
00:18:43.557 --> 00:18:44.949
She thinks it'’s bad manners.

417
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.386
I know.
That'’s why I do it.

418
00:18:48.475 --> 00:18:50.433
You know.
you didn'’t have to
honk so many times.

419
00:18:50.607 --> 00:18:52.522
One toot is enough.

420
00:18:53.828 --> 00:18:54.916
Uh--

421
00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.179
This trunk is full.

422
00:18:57.353 --> 00:19:00.835
Lou. why didn'’t
we take your SUV?

423
00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:02.184
It'’s in the shop.

424
00:19:02.358 --> 00:19:03.968
Don'’t worry. Betty.

425
00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.666
This thing has plenty of room.

426
00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:08.495
- It'’s a '’93.
- It is? It'’s--

427
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:10.323
They don'’t make them
like this anymore.

428
00:19:10.497 --> 00:19:12.281
They don'’t make this model
- like they used to.
- Oh. boy.

429
00:19:12.455 --> 00:19:16.459
<i>We are a mere two days away
from the Super Bowl.</i>

430
00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:18.113
<i>Yeah.
Houston better get ready.</i>

431
00:19:18.287 --> 00:19:19.854
<i>I think
they'’re gonna run out of beer.</i>

432
00:19:20.724 --> 00:19:21.638
Oh!

433
00:19:21.812 --> 00:19:23.118
Tight brakes.

434
00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:24.772
What you want me to do?
Not stop?

435
00:19:24.946 --> 00:19:27.818
She'’s not answering.
I'’ve called about ten times.

436
00:19:27.992 --> 00:19:29.211
Here. I'’ll get her.

437
00:19:29.385 --> 00:19:31.039
- It'’s the truth.
- Pacing will not help.

438
00:19:31.213 --> 00:19:32.736
Well. it can'’t hurt.

439
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.868
Afternoon. Bill.

440
00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:35.261
Here he is. Here he is.

441
00:19:35.435 --> 00:19:36.479
- Hey. ladies.
- Yes. Hello.

442
00:19:36.653 --> 00:19:37.741
I'’m sorry.
I went and checked.

443
00:19:37.915 --> 00:19:39.221
but Maura'’s sleeping.

444
00:19:40.091 --> 00:19:40.962
Please wake her up.

445
00:19:41.136 --> 00:19:42.485
Please just wake her up.

446
00:19:42.659 --> 00:19:44.661
We don'’t just
wake anyone up here.

447
00:19:44.835 --> 00:19:46.010
It'’s a very strict policy.

448
00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.056
It'’s part of
our core philosophy.

449
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.363
We take sleep seriously.

450
00:19:52.408 --> 00:19:53.627
See?

451
00:19:54.367 --> 00:19:55.368
Oh! Uh--

452
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.805
Excuse me.

453
00:19:57.979 --> 00:19:59.110
Excuse me.

454
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.200
Excuse me.

455
00:20:01.374 --> 00:20:03.158
Mmm. Mm-mmm.[Lou] Oh. damn it.

456
00:20:03.332 --> 00:20:05.421
- Maura! Maura!
- Oh. oh. Ladies. Seriously.

457
00:20:05.595 --> 00:20:06.770
- Shh! Please. please.
- Maura!

458
00:20:06.944 --> 00:20:08.294
- Okay. Okay. we'’re going.
- Thank you.

459
00:20:08.468 --> 00:20:09.817
- We just had a moment.
- Thank you.

460
00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:12.123
You guys are very fast.
That'’s a good sign.

461
00:20:13.473 --> 00:20:14.648
Where'’s Maura?

462
00:20:14.822 --> 00:20:16.258
She'’s sleeping.

463
00:20:16.432 --> 00:20:18.826
and the manager won'’t let us in
to wake her up.

464
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.089
What do we do?
We'’re gonna miss our flight.

465
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.787
I got it. I came prepared.

466
00:20:23.961 --> 00:20:25.485
There'’s no way
we'’re gonna make it. Where--

467
00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:26.790
What are you doing?

468
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.491
Are all your suitcases
just wigs?

469
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:36.626
Let'’s go.

470
00:20:37.888 --> 00:20:39.586
So you still get
the cute little face.

471
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.240
but you don'’t get
all the breathing problems.

472
00:20:41.414 --> 00:20:43.503
Oh. that is fascinating.

473
00:20:43.677 --> 00:20:45.635
Do you have any photos?

474
00:20:45.809 --> 00:20:47.246
Oh. yeah. Sure.

475
00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.465
All I have is pug photos.

476
00:20:49.639 --> 00:20:51.989
Look at this guy.[gasps] Oh. look at that.

477
00:20:52.163 --> 00:20:53.687
That'’s Toffee... Uh-huh.

478
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:55.602
...and that'’s Bobby
right there.
Let me show you.

479
00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:56.864
Can I take you on a tour?

480
00:20:58.822 --> 00:21:00.737
Wow.
- They have a cooking class.
- Wow. Look at that chef.

481
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:02.348
- Maura was right.
- It'’s Emeril in there.

482
00:21:02.522 --> 00:21:04.132
They have
absolutely everything here.

483
00:21:04.306 --> 00:21:06.439
She'’s been wanting me to take
a pottery class with her.

484
00:21:06.613 --> 00:21:08.571
but honestly. I can'’t
see myself throwing a pot.

485
00:21:08.745 --> 00:21:12.445
<i>I hope that you feel
like you used your time
with him wisely.</i>

486
00:21:12.619 --> 00:21:13.750
<i>because you lied
to him.</i> Excuse me.

487
00:21:13.924 --> 00:21:15.839
Does anyone know
where Maura Martinez is?

488
00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:19.495
Wait for the commercial.

489
00:21:20.496 --> 00:21:21.584
She'’s in her room.

490
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:24.718
Here. I'’ll take you.

491
00:21:26.546 --> 00:21:27.808
Come on. man.

492
00:21:27.982 --> 00:21:29.113
Thank you. sir. Thank you.

493
00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.680
-  Sorry.
- Yeah.

494
00:21:30.854 --> 00:21:32.203
<i>Well.
I think she'’s sleeping.</i>

495
00:21:32.378 --> 00:21:34.641
Well. thanks. um... Mickey.

496
00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:36.251
Look. Mickey.

497
00:21:36.425 --> 00:21:38.993
our flight is leaving
in three hours and 23 minutes.

498
00:21:40.081 --> 00:21:41.822
I'’ll. uh--
Okay. well. I'’ll be here.

499
00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:43.693
- I'’ll be right out here.
- Maura?

500
00:21:43.867 --> 00:21:45.869
I'’ll just be
- standing guard out here.
- Maura? Oh!

501
00:21:46.043 --> 00:21:47.523
Maura? Maura?

502
00:21:47.697 --> 00:21:49.090
- Honey. I can do this.
- Ma-- Okay. All right.

503
00:21:49.264 --> 00:21:51.048
Maura. [shouting] Maura!

504
00:21:51.788 --> 00:21:53.137
She'’s got a pulse.

505
00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:58.012
- I can'’t read that.
- Sleeping pills.

506
00:21:58.752 --> 00:22:00.014
Oh. Get a wheelchair.

507
00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:01.537
- Get a wheelchair.
- Mickey?

508
00:22:01.711 --> 00:22:02.843
- Oh. Mickey. good.
- Yeah?

509
00:22:03.017 --> 00:22:05.367
Could you possibly
get us a wheelchair?

510
00:22:06.063 --> 00:22:08.022
- A wheelchair?
- Yeah.

511
00:22:08.196 --> 00:22:09.676
You'’re breaking her out.
aren'’t you?

512
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.417
Well. no. we'’re actually--
We'’re going--

513
00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:14.245
- No. you'’re breaking her out.
- Okay. Yeah.

514
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.118
Well. it figures
that she'’d have
really cool friends.

515
00:22:17.292 --> 00:22:18.424
He'’s getting one.

516
00:22:19.468 --> 00:22:21.992
Take these with us.
They belong to her.

517
00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:24.604
- This cash too.
- Well. that--

518
00:22:24.778 --> 00:22:26.562
I'’ll give it to her
- in the car.
- All right.

519
00:22:26.736 --> 00:22:28.608
You'’ll witness it.
- You'’ll see it.
- Okay. I'’m witnessing.

520
00:22:28.782 --> 00:22:30.305
-  Is it clear?
- Yeah. it'’s clear.

521
00:22:30.479 --> 00:22:31.741
- Let'’s go. Let'’s go.
- Okay.

522
00:22:31.915 --> 00:22:33.439
- All clear.
- Out of the way.
Out of the way.

523
00:22:33.613 --> 00:22:35.266
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Watch your feet.

524
00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:36.790
This way. to the left.

525
00:22:36.964 --> 00:22:38.487
- To the left. Go. go. go.
- Here we go. Here we go.

526
00:22:38.661 --> 00:22:39.923
That was
our deluxe garden suite.

527
00:22:40.097 --> 00:22:41.969
but you know
our resort is 60 and over.

528
00:22:42.143 --> 00:22:45.973
so you might have to wait
- a few more years to qualify.
- Oh.

529
00:22:46.147 --> 00:22:47.191
Hey!

530
00:22:48.323 --> 00:22:49.280
- Go!
- Where are you going?

531
00:22:49.455 --> 00:22:50.630
- Stop right there.
- Tony. wait.

532
00:22:50.804 --> 00:22:52.022
Do you even care
about my dogs?

533
00:22:52.196 --> 00:22:53.241
No. I don'’t.

534
00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:55.548
Go. Go. I got you.

535
00:22:55.722 --> 00:22:57.811
Hey.
she'’s still sleeping.
Come back. Wait.

536
00:22:57.985 --> 00:23:02.685
Ladies and gentlemen.
Pat Sajak from <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>
is in the house.

537
00:23:02.859 --> 00:23:06.167
Pat Sajak is here.
and he'’s signing autographs
right now.

538
00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:08.125
- Pat Sajak.
- Hey. Cecile.
What'’s going on?

539
00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:10.127
Where is the party at. huh?

540
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:11.825
Oh. What'’s going on? Hey.
There'’s Vanna here too.

541
00:23:14.305 --> 00:23:16.133
Thank you. Mickey.[Betty] Thank you so much.

542
00:23:16.307 --> 00:23:17.613
Oh. Trish. there you are.

543
00:23:17.787 --> 00:23:18.701
Come on!

544
00:23:20.137 --> 00:23:21.530
We did it.

545
00:23:21.704 --> 00:23:23.924
Whoo!

546
00:23:26.187 --> 00:23:28.015
Wh-What are we celebrating?

547
00:23:28.189 --> 00:23:29.712
Oh. Maura.[Trish] We broke you out.

548
00:23:29.886 --> 00:23:31.410
We'’re going
to the Super Bowl!

549
00:23:31.584 --> 00:23:34.413
We'’re going to
- the Super Bowl!
- What? Oh!

550
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.982
<i>We'’re going to
the Super Bowl.</i>

551
00:23:49.297 --> 00:23:50.777
I'’m starving.

552
00:23:50.951 --> 00:23:53.388
Let'’s go to a bar.
- I love bars.
- No kidding.

553
00:23:53.562 --> 00:23:56.130
We'’re not going to a bar
so you can talk to men.

554
00:23:56.304 --> 00:23:58.741
Lou. I told you
I am not gonna flirt.

555
00:23:58.915 --> 00:24:01.178
I know this is a girls trip.

556
00:24:01.352 --> 00:24:03.050
Well. maybe I'’ll flirt.

557
00:24:03.224 --> 00:24:05.052
I don'’t think
I'’ve ever flirted
in my whole life.

558
00:24:05.226 --> 00:24:08.011
-  You can do it.
- Okay. Okay.

559
00:24:13.234 --> 00:24:14.278
Hrishi?

560
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.719
You have a nice head.

561
00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:21.895
Why. thank you.

562
00:24:22.852 --> 00:24:24.158
- We'’ll work on it.
- Okay.

563
00:24:24.332 --> 00:24:25.551
Yeah.

564
00:24:25.725 --> 00:24:27.901
[Lou] Oh. Erhan Suites.

565
00:24:28.075 --> 00:24:30.599
Is this great or what?

566
00:24:30.773 --> 00:24:33.080
And it'’s all
Super Bowl themed.

567
00:24:33.254 --> 00:24:35.648
Yeah. but they only
gave us one room.

568
00:24:35.822 --> 00:24:37.954
And there'’s no more rooms
in the whole hotel.

569
00:24:38.128 --> 00:24:40.348
There'’s no more rooms
in the whole city.

570
00:24:40.522 --> 00:24:42.611
At least this one
has two beds.

571
00:24:42.785 --> 00:24:43.917
Be appreciative.

572
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:45.353
Oh. look. There'’s Tom.

573
00:24:46.833 --> 00:24:49.400
Oh. he'’s much bigger
in real life.

574
00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:51.402
That'’s just a cardboard him.

575
00:24:53.013 --> 00:24:56.756
The real him is
at least twice that size.

576
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.192
Oh. Tom.

577
00:24:58.366 --> 00:25:00.977
Make that pass. Make it.

578
00:25:01.151 --> 00:25:03.719
I'’m taking this one.
He'’s cute.

579
00:25:03.893 --> 00:25:06.592
Maura! Who did you pick?

580
00:25:16.645 --> 00:25:17.951
- Hi. Hi.
- Mmm?

581
00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:19.387
<i>Hey. Mom?</i>

582
00:25:19.561 --> 00:25:22.172
Um. hey. I just got a call
from the hospital

583
00:25:22.346 --> 00:25:24.914
saying they'’re trying
to reach you
and you'’re not answering.

584
00:25:25.088 --> 00:25:28.265
<i>They called me
as your emergency contact.
Is everything okay?</i>

585
00:25:28.439 --> 00:25:31.617
Yes. I'’m fine.
Everything'’s fine.

586
00:25:31.791 --> 00:25:34.271
I-- I just had some tests done.

587
00:25:34.445 --> 00:25:35.838
They'’re calling...

588
00:25:37.144 --> 00:25:38.885
to go over them.

589
00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:40.887
Why are you whispering?

590
00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.890
<i>I'’m in a hotel room.</i>

591
00:25:44.064 --> 00:25:46.066
and the other girls
are sleeping.

592
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.633
<i>W-Where are you?</i>

593
00:25:49.112 --> 00:25:50.723
Uh. New Hampshire.

594
00:25:50.897 --> 00:25:54.074
We took a little trip
to a bed-and-breakfast.

595
00:25:54.248 --> 00:25:55.771
<i>Oh. that sounds nice.</i>

596
00:25:55.945 --> 00:25:58.339
Um. Mom.
call your doctor back. <i>Okay.</i>

597
00:25:58.513 --> 00:25:59.601
Night. sweetie.

598
00:25:59.775 --> 00:26:01.081
All right. love you. Night.

599
00:26:01.255 --> 00:26:02.561
Love you.

600
00:26:11.744 --> 00:26:12.875
I can'’t sleep.

601
00:26:13.528 --> 00:26:15.269
Me neither.

602
00:26:19.012 --> 00:26:20.448
I miss Frank.

603
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.583
I miss sleeping next to him.

604
00:26:26.454 --> 00:26:28.064
Nighttime'’s the worst.

605
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.897
I just lay there. awake.
thinking of him.

606
00:26:36.986 --> 00:26:39.249
I feel like
I'’m just living in the past.

607
00:26:40.555 --> 00:26:42.383
and I can'’t move on.

608
00:26:43.384 --> 00:26:47.040
Maura. you'’re not
living in the past.

609
00:26:47.214 --> 00:26:49.782
You'’re right here with us.

610
00:26:49.956 --> 00:26:51.740
And we'’re here for you.

611
00:26:53.437 --> 00:26:56.005
I love you.

612
00:26:56.179 --> 00:26:58.007
Oh. I love you.

613
00:27:01.881 --> 00:27:06.799
Here. section 138. row 30.
seats four. five. six and seven.

614
00:27:06.973 --> 00:27:08.235
They'’re so shiny.

615
00:27:08.844 --> 00:27:09.976
Can I hold them?

616
00:27:11.717 --> 00:27:13.893
Oh![Lou] Oh! Uh-oh!

617
00:27:14.067 --> 00:27:15.634
- Caught one.
- We can'’t lose those.

618
00:27:15.808 --> 00:27:17.331
- You'’re right.
- Those are gold.

619
00:27:17.505 --> 00:27:19.681
Well. clearly. you shouldn'’t
be holding them. then.

620
00:27:19.855 --> 00:27:22.075
How many reading glasses
have you gone through this year?

621
00:27:22.249 --> 00:27:23.598
That doesn'’t count.

622
00:27:23.772 --> 00:27:26.122
Reading glasses
are designed to be lost.

623
00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.605
Okay. fine.

624
00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:33.129
Who'’s the most responsible one?

625
00:27:33.739 --> 00:27:34.653
Oh!

626
00:27:34.827 --> 00:27:36.045
Me.

627
00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:37.264
Okay.

628
00:27:39.309 --> 00:27:41.137
Good thing
I brought my strap-on.

629
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.097
Um...

630
00:27:44.271 --> 00:27:45.228
...I don'’t think
that'’s what it'’s called.

631
00:27:45.402 --> 00:27:46.273
Sure it is. Look.

632
00:27:46.447 --> 00:27:48.536
You just strap...

633
00:27:50.233 --> 00:27:51.495
- it on.
- Wow.

634
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.236
That'’s a fanny pack.

635
00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.151
Not if you don'’t wear it
around your fanny.

636
00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:58.328
If you wear it like this.
it'’s a strap-on.

637
00:27:59.068 --> 00:28:00.896
And I will keep them safe.

638
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.463
Okay.

639
00:28:02.637 --> 00:28:05.509
Before we head out.
let'’s look at the agenda.

640
00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:08.077
First up.
the NFL Experience.

641
00:28:08.251 --> 00:28:09.862
Wait a minute.
"agenda" sounds like work.

642
00:28:10.036 --> 00:28:10.993
I love a good agenda.

643
00:28:11.167 --> 00:28:12.778
- Let'’s go to a spa.
- No.

644
00:28:12.952 --> 00:28:15.563
We didn'’t win these tickets
to go to a spa.

645
00:28:15.737 --> 00:28:17.696
We came here for football.

646
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.568
We'’re going to have
the NFL experience.

647
00:28:26.095 --> 00:28:28.402
I can'’t believe
we'’re actually here.

648
00:28:28.576 --> 00:28:29.969
I can'’t believe it.

649
00:28:33.537 --> 00:28:35.801
Oh. my gosh.
This place is huge.

650
00:28:35.975 --> 00:28:38.020
Look at all the helmets.

651
00:28:38.194 --> 00:28:39.892
Oh. oh! I wanna get one
for my grandkids.

652
00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:42.590
Oh. this is better
than my wildest dreams.

653
00:28:42.764 --> 00:28:43.678
Not mine.

654
00:28:43.852 --> 00:28:45.201
This morning. I had a dream

655
00:28:45.375 --> 00:28:47.813
I was going down
the Amazon River on a pickle

656
00:28:47.987 --> 00:28:50.380
with my papier-mâché children.

657
00:28:50.554 --> 00:28:52.426
There'’s so much here to do.

658
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.994
Yeah. well. you don'’t need
a brochure to tell you that.

659
00:28:55.168 --> 00:28:56.386
You know what?
I'’ve looked at this.

660
00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.258
If we wanna hit
all the booths.

661
00:28:58.432 --> 00:29:00.782
we have to average
under five minutes
for each one

662
00:29:00.956 --> 00:29:02.523
except. you know. the big--

663
00:29:16.319 --> 00:29:18.017
<i>Welcome to the QB Countdown.</i>

664
00:29:18.191 --> 00:29:21.542
<i>Let'’s see how many passes
you can complete in 45 seconds.</i>

665
00:29:21.716 --> 00:29:22.804
I'’m good at this. Watch.

666
00:29:22.978 --> 00:29:24.284
-  Next.
- I know. I know.

667
00:29:24.458 --> 00:29:26.547
Oh. I thought you was
waiting on your grandson.

668
00:29:26.721 --> 00:29:28.418
Nope. I'’m here to play.

669
00:29:28.592 --> 00:29:30.638
Well. good luck. Nana.

670
00:29:30.812 --> 00:29:32.509
I don'’t want you
to break anything.

671
00:29:32.683 --> 00:29:34.990
Hey. you sound confident.

672
00:29:35.164 --> 00:29:37.558
Would you like to
place a little wager on it?

673
00:29:40.039 --> 00:29:41.605
Ten bucks says
she won'’t hit
more than five.

674
00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.912
That'’s not a bet.

675
00:29:44.086 --> 00:29:46.610
She wins. she gets
your Falcons jersey.

676
00:29:48.395 --> 00:29:50.092
- Deal.
- Deal.

677
00:29:54.009 --> 00:29:55.532
There you go. Okay.

678
00:29:55.706 --> 00:29:57.534
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

679
00:29:57.708 --> 00:29:59.623
Technically.
we don'’t allow betting here.

680
00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:00.842
<i>Hey. Lou.</i>

681
00:30:01.016 --> 00:30:02.148
But they don'’t pay me that much.

682
00:30:02.322 --> 00:30:04.150
so let'’s see
how this plays out.

683
00:30:04.324 --> 00:30:05.847
<i>Lou! Look up.</i> Yeah. Let'’s see
how this plays out.

684
00:30:06.021 --> 00:30:09.068
<i>I'’m up here.
I'’m talking to you.</i>

685
00:30:09.242 --> 00:30:12.158
<i>Louella. don'’t worry about
how hard you throw it.</i>

686
00:30:12.332 --> 00:30:14.813
<i>It'’s all about
accuracy and touch.</i>

687
00:30:16.249 --> 00:30:17.250
All right. now. You'’re up.

688
00:30:18.207 --> 00:30:19.730
All right.[game referee] All right.

689
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.387
Ready. Set. Throw.

690
00:30:24.561 --> 00:30:26.041
Come on. Granny!

691
00:30:26.215 --> 00:30:28.304
Smoke '’em! Smoke '’em. Lou.

692
00:30:29.915 --> 00:30:31.960
- Oh!
- Hey. when are you
gonna start throwing?

693
00:30:32.134 --> 00:30:34.049
- For Pete'’s sake.
- Ma'’am. would you
mind your business?

694
00:30:34.223 --> 00:30:36.399
I'’ve never seen anything
like this in my life.

695
00:30:36.573 --> 00:30:38.053
Is there
- a mute button for her?
- Oh. oh. oh!

696
00:30:38.227 --> 00:30:40.099
- Really?
- I am terrified.

697
00:30:40.273 --> 00:30:42.405
Seriously. the eld--Do you have anything else
to do with your life?

698
00:30:42.579 --> 00:30:44.146
Oh. you'’re killing him.
You'’re killing him.

699
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.061
Ma'’am. you are
stressing me out. okay?

700
00:30:46.235 --> 00:30:47.976
Oh. really?
Is it distracting?

701
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.848
- I hope so.
- You dropped your multivitamin.

702
00:30:50.022 --> 00:30:51.371
Fancy footwork.
Look at that.

703
00:30:51.545 --> 00:30:52.720
Man. that is something.

704
00:30:52.894 --> 00:30:53.764
Whoo!

705
00:30:53.939 --> 00:30:55.288
Oh. my--Will you back up?

706
00:30:55.462 --> 00:30:57.333
- That'’s really unimpressive.
- Oh. my goodness.

707
00:30:57.507 --> 00:30:59.335
- Amazing!
- Ma'’am!

708
00:30:59.509 --> 00:31:02.034
Six. five. four... She'’s definitely
been day drinking.

709
00:31:02.208 --> 00:31:04.471
That'’s what her problem is....three. two. one!

710
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:09.868
- You did it! I told you.
- I knew I'’d make it.
I knew.

711
00:31:10.042 --> 00:31:11.260
That was incredible.

712
00:31:11.434 --> 00:31:12.783
Yeah. you. uh. you scored
over 20 points.

713
00:31:12.958 --> 00:31:14.437
which means you get
a free Super Bowl jersey.

714
00:31:14.611 --> 00:31:16.396
I want the Brady.
I want the Brady.

715
00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.919
What size are you?

716
00:31:19.399 --> 00:31:20.313
I'’m not wearing that.

717
00:31:20.487 --> 00:31:21.444
We can go double or nothing

718
00:31:21.618 --> 00:31:22.750
if you want your jersey back.

719
00:31:22.924 --> 00:31:25.231
But if we win.
you gotta wear that.

720
00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:27.059
Fine.

721
00:31:27.233 --> 00:31:30.627
Trish. we'’re in Houston.
Can'’t we get some barbecue?

722
00:31:31.411 --> 00:31:33.152
Oh. your book! Look.

723
00:31:34.414 --> 00:31:35.719
They have it.

724
00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:37.460
- Look at-- Sign it.
- My God.

725
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.769
- Come on. Really?
- Yes. I have a pen.
It'’s here somewhere.

726
00:31:41.943 --> 00:31:42.901
You'’re bad.

727
00:31:44.467 --> 00:31:45.512
All right.

728
00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:48.428
Excuse me. what are you doing?

729
00:31:48.602 --> 00:31:51.561
Oh. I'’m just
admiring these books.

730
00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:53.172
Uh. you'’re gonna have to
pay for that.

731
00:31:53.346 --> 00:31:55.087
She'’s signing it.

732
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.395
You'’re--
- You'’re Virginia Ledough?
- Ledoux.

733
00:32:00.135 --> 00:32:01.528
Oh. my gosh.

734
00:32:01.702 --> 00:32:04.009
I sell so many copies
of your book.

735
00:32:04.183 --> 00:32:05.358
And I'’m a personal fan.

736
00:32:05.532 --> 00:32:06.837
You know what?
You guys just go ahead.

737
00:32:07.012 --> 00:32:08.448
I'’m gonna find some barbecue.

738
00:32:08.622 --> 00:32:10.319
- I think it'’s outside.
- I'’ll see you in a bit.

739
00:32:10.493 --> 00:32:12.104
Are you working on anything new?

740
00:32:12.278 --> 00:32:15.194
Actually. yeah.
I'’m working on
a holiday-themed book.

741
00:32:15.368 --> 00:32:17.196
<i>I Gronk You
a Merry Christmas.</i>

742
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.632
Can I preorder?

743
00:32:18.806 --> 00:32:20.068
Yeah. absolutely.

744
00:32:20.242 --> 00:32:23.115
Holidays are
a very sexual time for me.

745
00:32:24.377 --> 00:32:25.421
Wow.

746
00:32:26.074 --> 00:32:27.336
Uh. hello?

747
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.511
Excuse me.

748
00:32:29.251 --> 00:32:31.123
Oh. Hi. Um...

749
00:32:31.297 --> 00:32:32.863
I'’d like to get some wings.

750
00:32:33.038 --> 00:32:34.561
Oh. I'’m sorry.
They'’re not for sale.

751
00:32:34.735 --> 00:32:36.650
This is a spicy wings contest.

752
00:32:37.216 --> 00:32:38.478
- Really?
- Yeah.

753
00:32:38.652 --> 00:32:40.610
But I must warn you.
it gets really intense.

754
00:32:40.784 --> 00:32:43.178
They got spices that sound like
they'’re from a horror film.

755
00:32:43.352 --> 00:32:44.875
- Like what?
- California Reaper...

756
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.530
Whoa....ghost pepper.
Teddy Bears Picnic.

757
00:32:47.704 --> 00:32:49.228
Now. that one'’s the most scary

758
00:32:49.402 --> 00:32:51.230
'’cause it sounds like
it'’s all warm and cuddly.

759
00:32:51.404 --> 00:32:54.537
but it'’s not.
- It'’s really not.
- Oh.

760
00:32:54.711 --> 00:32:56.452
Well. I could use
a little spice.

761
00:32:56.626 --> 00:32:57.714
This ain'’t no little spice.

762
00:32:58.672 --> 00:33:00.021
And this is his contest.

763
00:33:00.891 --> 00:33:01.805
Guy Fieri.

764
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.198
Oh.

765
00:33:03.372 --> 00:33:04.547
I mean. look at him.

766
00:33:05.461 --> 00:33:06.897
He even looks spicy.

767
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:09.204
I'’m in.

768
00:33:09.378 --> 00:33:10.597
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

769
00:33:10.771 --> 00:33:12.555
I'’m gonna need
your emergency contacts

770
00:33:12.729 --> 00:33:15.602
- in case something happens.
- Well. that would be
my husband. Mark.

771
00:33:15.776 --> 00:33:17.865
But don'’t call him.
Don'’t call him.

772
00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:20.389
I don'’t want him
knowing I was doing this.

773
00:33:20.563 --> 00:33:22.565
If you black out.
you don'’t want me
to call your husband?

774
00:33:22.739 --> 00:33:25.220
- No. Don'’t call him.
- So who do
you want me to call?

775
00:33:26.917 --> 00:33:28.006
An ambulance?

776
00:33:38.668 --> 00:33:39.930
Yay!

777
00:33:43.412 --> 00:33:45.110
Ladies and gentlemen!

778
00:33:45.284 --> 00:33:49.418
Are you ready for
the Spicy BBQ
Hot Wings Challenge?

779
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:52.900
The rules are simple.

780
00:33:53.074 --> 00:33:55.990
If you don'’t wanna
clear your seat.
you better handle the heat.

781
00:33:56.164 --> 00:33:58.166
You touch the milk. you'’re gone.

782
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.561
Let'’s bring out
the pain train to Flavortown.

783
00:34:01.735 --> 00:34:04.955
In three. two. one.
Bring the pain.

784
00:34:10.309 --> 00:34:12.876
Oh. my God.
- That'’s Betty!
- Oh. my God.

785
00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:15.531
This is the train to pain.

786
00:34:15.705 --> 00:34:17.185
Who can handle the heat?

787
00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:18.795
Hold it together.

788
00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:20.188
Hang in there.

789
00:34:20.362 --> 00:34:22.277
Hang in there. Hang in there.

790
00:34:22.451 --> 00:34:24.062
Oh! You'’re gone.

791
00:34:24.236 --> 00:34:25.324
Go. Go. Go.

792
00:34:25.498 --> 00:34:27.413
Excuse me. Betty?

793
00:34:27.587 --> 00:34:30.416
You don'’t have to
- eat it all.
- It'’s okay. I'’m hungry.

794
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.721
I know her!

795
00:34:31.895 --> 00:34:33.636
"And it was then.

796
00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:37.597
on the hallowed turf
of Gillette Stadium.

797
00:34:37.771 --> 00:34:39.903
that Gronk took her.

798
00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:41.905
and she knew

799
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.084
this was the best
a man could get."

800
00:34:50.305 --> 00:34:52.525
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

801
00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:55.136
This is all so unexpected.

802
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.834
Uh. if I'’m not mistaken.
Mrs. Ledoux.

803
00:34:58.008 --> 00:34:59.314
you are a multi-hyphenate.

804
00:34:59.488 --> 00:35:02.361
Aren'’t you
the original Mayflower Girl?

805
00:35:02.535 --> 00:35:03.666
I love your book.

806
00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.538
Thank you.

807
00:35:05.712 --> 00:35:08.062
Well. that was--
that was a long time ago.

808
00:35:08.236 --> 00:35:10.195
Well. beauty has
no expiration date.

809
00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:12.893
Dan O'’Callahan.

810
00:35:15.852 --> 00:35:17.332
Oh. my God. That ring.

811
00:35:18.638 --> 00:35:20.292
Oh. my God. The fingernails.

812
00:35:21.423 --> 00:35:23.947
Football nails.
- You'’ve got two rings.
- Yep.

813
00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:27.037
I have to assume
- you-- you played.
- I did.

814
00:35:27.212 --> 00:35:29.170
Two Super Bowls.
Two different teams.

815
00:35:29.344 --> 00:35:32.608
So. do I just call you
the Mayflower Girl?

816
00:35:32.782 --> 00:35:33.827
Patricia.

817
00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:35.220
-  Love your book.
- Thank you.

818
00:35:35.394 --> 00:35:36.438
- Saved our marriage.
- Thanks.

819
00:35:36.612 --> 00:35:38.048
Wait a minute.
not Virginia?

820
00:35:39.485 --> 00:35:42.531
Uh. Virginia Ledoux
was the name of my poodle.

821
00:35:42.705 --> 00:35:46.231
Well. your poodle
must have a real thing
for football players.

822
00:35:46.405 --> 00:35:47.449
No.

823
00:35:48.537 --> 00:35:49.973
I do.

824
00:35:50.148 --> 00:35:51.236
Ladies and gentlemen.

825
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.151
here we are
at the pinnacle of pain.

826
00:35:53.325 --> 00:35:54.674
the temple of heat.

827
00:35:54.848 --> 00:35:56.415
Our final round.

828
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:58.982
Dal versus Betty.

829
00:36:00.462 --> 00:36:01.855
Dal. how you feeling. bud?

830
00:36:02.029 --> 00:36:03.857
I'’m feeling great. Guy--All right. Great. Dal.

831
00:36:04.031 --> 00:36:05.424
And. Betty. everything okay?

832
00:36:05.598 --> 00:36:06.860
Yeah.
I'’m just getting ready.

833
00:36:07.034 --> 00:36:08.818
All right.
Remember. embrace the spice.

834
00:36:08.992 --> 00:36:11.560
Lean into this. Don'’t fight it.
It only makes it harder.

835
00:36:11.734 --> 00:36:13.301
- Okay.
- You go big or you go home.

836
00:36:13.475 --> 00:36:14.998
- Okay.
- All right.

837
00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:18.785
All right.
For this final round.
Satan'’s Tongue.

838
00:36:18.959 --> 00:36:20.656
The most difficult wing
we have.

839
00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:23.964
And we'’re going
on three. two. one.

840
00:36:24.573 --> 00:36:25.879
Bring the heat!

841
00:36:26.053 --> 00:36:29.056
Dal gets a nice portion.
So does Betty.

842
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:31.363
Dal with one--
Dal with one bite.

843
00:36:32.494 --> 00:36:33.495
Betty with two.

844
00:36:34.061 --> 00:36:35.062
Dal?

845
00:36:35.236 --> 00:36:36.455
Dal'’s not looking good.

846
00:36:36.629 --> 00:36:38.544
Dal'’s shaking.
Betty has another bite.

847
00:36:38.718 --> 00:36:40.502
Dal spits. Dal'’s out!

848
00:36:40.676 --> 00:36:43.070
Give it up
for our champ. Betty!

849
00:36:44.463 --> 00:36:45.464
Oh. well...

850
00:36:46.682 --> 00:36:48.380
Ladies and gentlemen.
your champ. Betty!

851
00:36:48.554 --> 00:36:50.686
Betty. how'’d you pull that off?

852
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.906
That one had a...
...bit of a kick.

853
00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.647
A b-- Listen.

854
00:36:54.821 --> 00:36:56.823
it was amazing to watch you
knock that out of the park.

855
00:36:56.997 --> 00:36:58.128
How did you do this?

856
00:36:58.303 --> 00:36:59.826
How do you handle
spice at this level?

857
00:37:00.696 --> 00:37:02.437
I don'’t know.

858
00:37:02.611 --> 00:37:05.832
Unless it has extreme flavor.
I can'’t taste anything anymore.

859
00:37:06.006 --> 00:37:07.137
Well. speaking of
extreme flavor.

860
00:37:07.312 --> 00:37:09.314
I got some brisket
you gotta try.

861
00:37:09.488 --> 00:37:12.404
- Can I bring my friends?
- Absolutely!
You'’re the champ!

862
00:37:12.578 --> 00:37:14.101
Give it up for champ Betty!

863
00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:17.670
Maura. would you like
some more brisket?

864
00:37:17.844 --> 00:37:20.716
Oh. I could eat your brisket
all day long. you brute.

865
00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:22.588
There you go. There you go.

866
00:37:22.762 --> 00:37:23.806
Mmm! Mmm!

867
00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.243
It'’s so good.

868
00:37:25.808 --> 00:37:27.593
- Ah!
- Trish!

869
00:37:27.767 --> 00:37:28.898
- Oh. hi.
- Trish!

870
00:37:29.072 --> 00:37:30.204
Are you Guy Fieri?

871
00:37:30.378 --> 00:37:32.250
Of course he is.
Where have you been?

872
00:37:32.424 --> 00:37:33.381
I'’ve been talking to a fan.

873
00:37:33.555 --> 00:37:34.904
and he invited us
to a party.

874
00:37:35.078 --> 00:37:36.645
- Look.
- A fan?

875
00:37:36.819 --> 00:37:38.125
A fan of my writing.

876
00:37:39.126 --> 00:37:40.736
Also a two-time
Super Bowl champion.

877
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:42.042
Trish.

878
00:37:42.216 --> 00:37:44.000
I didn'’t flirt.
I mean. he did.

879
00:37:44.174 --> 00:37:46.873
Don'’t you think
we should rest before
the big game tomorrow?

880
00:37:47.047 --> 00:37:48.483
Wait. If it'’s that party.

881
00:37:48.657 --> 00:37:50.268
oh. you go--
It'’s gonna be off the hook.

882
00:37:50.442 --> 00:37:52.052
I'’m going to that party.

883
00:37:52.226 --> 00:37:53.923
Yeah. I mean. he'’s right.
Look. we'’re not playing.

884
00:37:55.621 --> 00:37:57.971
I thought the whole point
of this trip was having
an adventure together.

885
00:37:58.145 --> 00:37:59.320
This is an adventure.

886
00:37:59.494 --> 00:38:00.539
I'’m there.

887
00:38:00.713 --> 00:38:02.018
Will there be dancing?

888
00:38:02.192 --> 00:38:03.803
If you'’re going.
there'’ll be dancing.

889
00:38:06.893 --> 00:38:08.590
- Oh. gosh. Betty?
- Yes?

890
00:38:08.764 --> 00:38:10.549
Betty. Betty. Betty.
Let me just check your lips.

891
00:38:10.723 --> 00:38:12.420
Oh.

892
00:38:12.594 --> 00:38:14.857
You.
- who never wear lipstick.
- Uh-huh.

893
00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:16.946
Okay. good.
- Don'’t lick your lips.
- All right.

894
00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.296
Let me see
your beauty mark.

895
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:19.862
- Very good.
- Come on. Let'’s go.

896
00:38:20.036 --> 00:38:22.038
Okay. Hot stuff.

897
00:38:23.431 --> 00:38:25.041
Are we gonna be
the oldest people here?

898
00:38:25.215 --> 00:38:27.696
Betty.
don'’t reinforce stereotypes.

899
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:29.916
Oh. there'’s Dan. Dan!

900
00:38:31.526 --> 00:38:33.311
You have a fan named Dan?

901
00:38:33.485 --> 00:38:34.834
Yeah. Dan O'’Callahan.

902
00:38:35.008 --> 00:38:36.357
Hey. come on up!

903
00:38:36.531 --> 00:38:37.358
I thought you said
you'’ve been working out.

904
00:38:37.532 --> 00:38:38.620
I have.

905
00:38:38.794 --> 00:38:40.230
How many leg days
have you skipped?

906
00:38:40.405 --> 00:38:41.928
Look at those chicken legs.

907
00:38:42.102 --> 00:38:44.452
That'’s mean.
He'’s got great legs.

908
00:38:44.626 --> 00:38:47.150
Oh. it'’s called "negging."
It'’s how we flirt.

909
00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:50.240
Why would you focus
- on negative things?
- Can you let them up?

910
00:38:50.415 --> 00:38:52.025
Oh. he'’s getting us in.[bouncer] Sorry. ladies.

911
00:38:52.199 --> 00:38:53.896
You know. he used to
- play for the Pats.
- Sorry.

912
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.768
It is so great
to meet you all.

913
00:38:55.942 --> 00:38:57.552
Dan.
You played for the Pats?

914
00:38:57.726 --> 00:38:59.162
- I did. For three years.
- Wow.

915
00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:01.556
But I spent most of my time
with the Raiders.

916
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:02.644
Hmm.

917
00:39:02.818 --> 00:39:03.863
Okay.

918
00:39:04.037 --> 00:39:06.300
You look lovely.

919
00:39:06.474 --> 00:39:07.475
Thank you.

920
00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:11.174
Well. hey. I wanna
introduce you to
some of my friends.

921
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:12.437
Come on inside.

922
00:39:12.611 --> 00:39:14.047
Where'’s Maura?
Where'’s Maura?

923
00:39:14.221 --> 00:39:16.092
Oh. oh. oh. Come on. Maura.
We gotta stick together.

924
00:39:16.266 --> 00:39:18.356
Christ'’s sake.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Excuse us.

925
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:20.575
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
- It'’s too bad.

926
00:39:20.749 --> 00:39:22.403
- Bye. Thanks a lot.
- You are gentlemen.

927
00:39:22.577 --> 00:39:23.883
I really appreciate it.[Betty] Come on.

928
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:27.016
Where did Trish go?

929
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.237
Wow. I have never been
to a party like this.

930
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.415
The only parties we go to
are faculty parties

931
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:36.461
where they just
have cheap champagne.

932
00:39:36.635 --> 00:39:39.246
Last party I went to
was a funeral.

933
00:39:40.552 --> 00:39:41.770
It was fun.

934
00:39:41.944 --> 00:39:43.424
I bet they'’ve got
tons of drugs here.

935
00:39:43.598 --> 00:39:44.556
Piles of cocaine.

936
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:46.122
I bet they even have

937
00:39:46.296 --> 00:39:48.168
one of those <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>
sex rooms somewhere.

938
00:39:48.342 --> 00:39:49.691
don'’t you think?

939
00:39:49.865 --> 00:39:51.693
You know. I'’m gonna
head back to the hotel.

940
00:39:51.867 --> 00:39:53.826
- I-- I need to relax.
- Here.

941
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.697
Oh. thank you.

942
00:39:56.698 --> 00:39:58.004
Who are you?

943
00:39:58.178 --> 00:40:00.485
Oh. we met outside.
Yes. this is--Sophie.

944
00:40:00.659 --> 00:40:02.704
- Sophie. Oh. this is Sophie.
- Yeah.

945
00:40:02.878 --> 00:40:04.445
What a lovely name.

946
00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:06.578
That'’s my granddaughter'’s name.
- Sophie.
- Mmm!

947
00:40:06.752 --> 00:40:08.231
Just a wonderful name.

948
00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:09.798
- These are good.
- Very good.

949
00:40:09.972 --> 00:40:11.365
Well. careful.
They'’re high dosage.

950
00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:13.280
- What?
- High dosage?

951
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.630
-  Yeah.
- Are they drugs?

952
00:40:16.805 --> 00:40:18.633
Yeah. You said
you wanted to relax.

953
00:40:18.807 --> 00:40:20.200
Mmm.

954
00:40:20.374 --> 00:40:21.636
What-- Sophie!

955
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.464
Say. Sophie!

956
00:40:23.638 --> 00:40:24.639
Lou. where are you going?

957
00:40:24.813 --> 00:40:26.989
I ate two of '’em. Two gummies.

958
00:40:27.163 --> 00:40:29.252
What'’ll happen
if I had three?

959
00:40:31.124 --> 00:40:32.517
Your friend drugged us.

960
00:40:32.691 --> 00:40:34.867
Big deal. You used to
smoke pot all the time.

961
00:40:35.041 --> 00:40:36.259
That was medicinal.

962
00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:39.828
All right. Okay.
We did it. We took drugs.

963
00:40:40.002 --> 00:40:42.614
But let'’s just.
you know. enjoy it.

964
00:40:42.788 --> 00:40:44.224
I'’m going back to the hotel.

965
00:40:44.398 --> 00:40:45.747
I need my ticket.

966
00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:47.096
I'’ve gotta get some sleep

967
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:48.794
so I'’m fresh
for the game tomorrow.

968
00:40:48.968 --> 00:40:49.969
which is why we'’re here.

969
00:40:52.014 --> 00:40:55.278
Unless you two are so hungover
you can'’t join me.

970
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.412
Gimme the ticket.

971
00:40:58.586 --> 00:40:59.718
Oh. God. Wait.

972
00:40:59.892 --> 00:41:01.328
I left it at the hotel.
didn'’t I?

973
00:41:01.502 --> 00:41:02.938
I took it off at the--

974
00:41:03.112 --> 00:41:04.418
God. no. I didn'’t. I didn'’t.

975
00:41:04.592 --> 00:41:06.507
I took it off at
the spicy wings contest.

976
00:41:06.681 --> 00:41:07.769
I-- I put it down on the--

977
00:41:07.943 --> 00:41:09.292
You'’ve lost the tickets?

978
00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:11.294
No. I was trying to pretend
it wasn'’t spicy.

979
00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:12.948
and it was
really. really spicy. and I--

980
00:41:13.122 --> 00:41:14.472
We'’ve got to
find those tickets.

981
00:41:14.646 --> 00:41:17.039
We'’ve got to go to
the NFL Experience now.

982
00:41:17.213 --> 00:41:18.998
- It'’s closed.
- Look. Listen.

983
00:41:19.172 --> 00:41:21.696
Now. just calm down.
Everybody calm down.

984
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:24.482
Guy said he was going to be
at this party tonight.

985
00:41:24.656 --> 00:41:26.092
We just find Guy.

986
00:41:26.266 --> 00:41:28.573
I'’m sure he knows where
the strap-on thing is--

987
00:41:28.747 --> 00:41:33.578
How do you expect to find
one guy in a sea of thousands?

988
00:41:33.752 --> 00:41:35.144
Huh?

989
00:41:35.318 --> 00:41:37.277
- Huh?
- There! There he is.
There he is.

990
00:41:37.451 --> 00:41:39.627
- Where? I don'’t see him.
- He went that way.

991
00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:41.411
I don'’t see him.
Why are you jogging?

992
00:41:41.586 --> 00:41:43.152
I'’m jogging
because he'’s jogging.

993
00:41:43.326 --> 00:41:44.458
Girls?

994
00:42:01.475 --> 00:42:02.911
Guy?

995
00:42:10.353 --> 00:42:11.529
Maura?

996
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.836
Where did Maura go?

997
00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:16.446
Well. I don'’t know.
Where'’s Guy?

998
00:42:16.621 --> 00:42:17.709
I thought
we were looking for him.

Yes. but doesn'’t this music
make you want to dance?

No. we'’ve gotta stay focused.

1013
00:43:38.659 --> 00:43:39.747
I think so.

I'’m so sorry I hit you.

- Let me see.
- Mmm.

1019
00:44:25.793 --> 00:44:27.229
It'’s not bad. It'’s not bad.

1020
00:44:27.403 --> 00:44:28.883
You just--

1021
00:44:29.057 --> 00:44:31.669
It'’s just I like to dance.
I never get to dance.

1022
00:44:34.193 --> 00:44:36.456
That gummy bear
was a humdinger.

1023
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:39.111
Maybe you oughta slow down.

1024
00:44:39.285 --> 00:44:42.157
Yeah. Maybe you oughta
slow down too.

1025
00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:43.985
This is pretty slow.

1026
00:44:44.159 --> 00:44:46.161
At the hottest party
in Houston.
with the hottest people.

1027
00:44:46.335 --> 00:44:48.598
I'’m sitting here
with someone'’s grandma.

1028
00:44:50.862 --> 00:44:52.994
Chomping the gummy bears
or whatever.

1029
00:44:55.736 --> 00:44:58.130
I get it. Oh. I get it.

1030
00:44:58.304 --> 00:44:59.609
I get it.

1031
00:44:59.784 --> 00:45:01.655
It'’s the negative.
you know. the neg--

1032
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:03.875
I can do this. I can do this.

1033
00:45:04.745 --> 00:45:05.746
Let me look at you.

1034
00:45:07.487 --> 00:45:09.097
No. My God.

1035
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:10.882
You'’re. like. perfect.
Stand up.

1036
00:45:12.144 --> 00:45:13.232
Stand up.

1037
00:45:15.364 --> 00:45:16.714
Turn around. Turn around.

1038
00:45:17.323 --> 00:45:19.107
Oh. No. Turn. quick.

1039
00:45:19.281 --> 00:45:20.326
Okay.

1040
00:45:21.588 --> 00:45:24.286
Sit down.
There must be something.

1041
00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:25.635
- Show me your teeth.
- What?

1042
00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:27.072
Let me see your teeth.
Come on. Show me.

1043
00:45:27.246 --> 00:45:28.334
- Oh. there it is.
- What?

1044
00:45:28.508 --> 00:45:29.509
- Look at that. Oh. my God.
- What?

1045
00:45:29.683 --> 00:45:30.945
A snaggletooth.

1046
00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:32.991
Oh. God. you could
eat corn through a fence.

1047
00:45:33.165 --> 00:45:34.079
Oh!

1048
00:45:34.253 --> 00:45:35.254
Yep. yep.

1049
00:45:36.603 --> 00:45:37.735
Yeah.

1050
00:45:37.909 --> 00:45:38.823
Hi. honey.

1051
00:45:38.997 --> 00:45:40.433
Well. hi back to you.

1052
00:45:40.607 --> 00:45:42.174
So. I wanted you to know.

1053
00:45:42.348 --> 00:45:45.264
I-I sent you two versions
of the paper. A and B.

1054
00:45:45.438 --> 00:45:48.006
and I want you to tell me
which one to go with. Okay?

1055
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.355
<i>No. I-I can'’t.</i>

1056
00:45:49.529 --> 00:45:51.574
I'’m at a party
with a bunch of kids.

1057
00:45:51.749 --> 00:45:53.838
I'’m-- I'’m 36. I'’m a man.[Mark] <i>Uh. what?</i>

1058
00:45:54.012 --> 00:45:55.100
You'’re working on it.

1059
00:45:55.274 --> 00:45:56.884
<i>I gotta go.</i> Uh--

1060
00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.104
Uh. o-okay.

1061
00:46:05.675 --> 00:46:07.025
Maura.

1062
00:46:07.199 --> 00:46:08.504
Yeah? Hmm?

1063
00:46:09.462 --> 00:46:11.116
Bet'’s to you. Maura.

1064
00:46:12.857 --> 00:46:14.162
I'’ve been playing?

1065
00:46:14.336 --> 00:46:16.164
No. you'’ve been killing it.

1066
00:46:16.338 --> 00:46:17.513
Killing it.
Come on. Gugu.

1067
00:46:17.687 --> 00:46:19.298
She'’s got
half the table on tilt.

1068
00:46:19.472 --> 00:46:20.821
Every time she raises.

1069
00:46:20.995 --> 00:46:22.127
she says she'’s gonna
take us to Flavortown.

1070
00:46:22.301 --> 00:46:23.302
and then she--

1071
00:46:23.476 --> 00:46:24.738
she nicknamed me "Brisket."

1072
00:46:24.912 --> 00:46:26.392
You know what?
I shouldn'’t be here.

1073
00:46:26.566 --> 00:46:27.959
I should leave
- I don'’t belong here.
- No. no. no.

1074
00:46:28.133 --> 00:46:29.047
You gotta stay.

1075
00:46:29.221 --> 00:46:30.352
- You got to.
- Yes.

1076
00:46:30.526 --> 00:46:32.572
You are meant to be here.

1077
00:46:32.746 --> 00:46:36.271
Sometimes fate puts you
exactly where
you supposed to be.

1078
00:46:36.445 --> 00:46:37.533
It'’s your bet.

1079
00:46:38.578 --> 00:46:40.101
Oh! Yeah. okay.

1080
00:46:40.275 --> 00:46:41.276
Um...

1081
00:46:42.321 --> 00:46:43.235
How much is this?

1082
00:46:43.409 --> 00:46:44.540
Forty.[Maura] Okay.

1083
00:46:44.714 --> 00:46:47.587
I'’ll. uh--
I'’ll raise you $40.

1084
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:49.023
Oh. wow. Really?

1085
00:46:49.197 --> 00:46:50.633
It'’s 40.000.

1086
00:46:51.678 --> 00:46:53.071
Right.

1087
00:46:54.202 --> 00:46:55.508
Right.

1088
00:46:56.117 --> 00:46:57.205
Okay.

1089
00:46:57.945 --> 00:46:59.642
I'’ll raise you $40.000.

1090
00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:01.775
I'’m already out.

1091
00:47:01.949 --> 00:47:03.908
You are a shark.
aren'’t you. Maura?

1092
00:47:04.082 --> 00:47:06.998
No. no.
My late husband loved gambling.

1093
00:47:07.172 --> 00:47:09.696
And he would lose
every single time.

1094
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:11.437
I would win all the time.

1095
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:13.961
so I would slip
some of these chips
under his stack

1096
00:47:14.135 --> 00:47:15.441
so he could keep on playing.

1097
00:47:15.615 --> 00:47:17.269
That'’s a real
sweet story. but...

1098
00:47:17.443 --> 00:47:19.184
Damn....flip '’em. Flavortown.

1099
00:47:19.358 --> 00:47:20.620
Okay.

1100
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.537
Trip twos! Sorceress.

1101
00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:25.930
Come on.[Brisket] Sorceress.

1102
00:47:26.104 --> 00:47:27.540
Dark sorcery.

1103
00:47:27.714 --> 00:47:29.107
Shut it. Brisket.

1104
00:47:29.934 --> 00:47:31.326
Oh. shit.

1105
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.241
Any requests?

1106
00:47:33.415 --> 00:47:34.808
Beastie Boys!

1107
00:47:34.982 --> 00:47:38.681
Try "I Won'’t Dance"
in the original key of C.

1108
00:47:38.856 --> 00:47:41.467
Ma'’am. we'’re not doing karaoke.

1109
00:47:42.729 --> 00:47:43.861
My phone.

1110
00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:48.866
Hello?

1111
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.259
Mom. did you call
the hospital?

1112
00:47:52.565 --> 00:47:53.827
No. not yet.

1113
00:47:54.001 --> 00:47:56.134
Mom. you need to call.
It'’s important.

1114
00:47:56.308 --> 00:47:57.309
<i>Where are you?</i>

1115
00:47:58.092 --> 00:48:00.007
Some Texas mansion.

1116
00:48:00.181 --> 00:48:02.618
<i>But you said
you were in New Hampshire.</i>

1117
00:48:02.792 --> 00:48:06.100
I'’m not. I'’m in Houston
for the Super Bowl.

1118
00:48:06.274 --> 00:48:08.450
<i>The Super Bowl?
How did you afford that?</i>

1119
00:48:08.624 --> 00:48:11.497
<i>It'’s fine.
Don'’t worry about it.</i>

1120
00:48:11.671 --> 00:48:14.674
Wh-- What'’s going on?
Why are you lying to me?

1121
00:48:14.848 --> 00:48:17.851
Everything'’s fine.
I had some tests done.

1122
00:48:18.025 --> 00:48:20.027
They'’re calling me
to go over them.

1123
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:21.637
They mailed me the results.

1124
00:48:21.811 --> 00:48:23.161
And?

1125
00:48:23.335 --> 00:48:25.163
I haven'’t opened them yet.

1126
00:48:25.337 --> 00:48:27.208
<i>What? Mom. open the letter.</i>

1127
00:48:27.382 --> 00:48:28.253
No.

1128
00:48:28.427 --> 00:48:29.863
What?

1129
00:48:30.037 --> 00:48:32.910
Why does it matter?
What'’s another two days?

1130
00:48:33.084 --> 00:48:35.173
This is something
I always wanted to do.

1131
00:48:35.347 --> 00:48:40.439
To go to the Super Bowl
with my friends
and see Tom Brady win.

1132
00:48:42.223 --> 00:48:45.009
So. no. I'’m not gonna
open that envelope.

1133
00:48:45.183 --> 00:48:48.577
Because what'’s inside
could ruin this for everyone.

1134
00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:51.754
Everyone. Where is--

1135
00:48:53.495 --> 00:48:54.583
I gotta go.

1136
00:48:54.757 --> 00:48:57.369
No. Mom. Mom?

1137
00:48:57.543 --> 00:49:00.589
Has anyone seen Guy Ferrari?

1138
00:49:00.763 --> 00:49:03.331
Uh. he looks like
a Flamin'’ Hot Cheeto.

1139
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:06.900
What is this place?

1140
00:49:16.388 --> 00:49:17.302
Hi.

1141
00:49:19.695 --> 00:49:21.959
I'’ll be right back.

1142
00:49:22.133 --> 00:49:23.569
Lou. what'’s the matter?

1143
00:49:24.396 --> 00:49:26.702
I got drugged by gummy bears.

1144
00:49:26.876 --> 00:49:28.008
I should go. I should go.

1145
00:49:28.182 --> 00:49:30.315
Maura and Betty are gone.

1146
00:49:30.489 --> 00:49:32.186
and the tickets are missing.

1147
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.362
What?
What happened to the tickets?

1148
00:49:35.015 --> 00:49:36.364
Hot sauce.

1149
00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:38.410
Betty? Maura?

1150
00:49:38.584 --> 00:49:40.281
How high are you. Lou?

1151
00:49:40.847 --> 00:49:42.501
Substantially.

1152
00:49:42.675 --> 00:49:45.330
Oh. okay.
What you thinkin'’. Maura?

1153
00:49:45.504 --> 00:49:46.635
Wouldn'’t you like to know?

1154
00:49:46.809 --> 00:49:47.985
Maura!

1155
00:49:49.116 --> 00:49:50.291
Are you playing poker
right now?

1156
00:49:50.465 --> 00:49:52.380
Yeah.
- Give me a sec. okay?
- Yeah.

1157
00:49:53.555 --> 00:49:54.469
I have a great hand.

1158
00:49:54.643 --> 00:49:55.688
We'’ve gotta go.

1159
00:49:55.862 --> 00:49:57.733
- No!
- The tickets are lost!

1160
00:49:57.907 --> 00:49:59.170
I know.

1161
00:49:59.344 --> 00:50:02.086
But if I win this hand.
I can buy tickets.

1162
00:50:02.912 --> 00:50:04.001
- Fine. Go beat him.
- Go!

1163
00:50:04.175 --> 00:50:05.915
All right.[Gugu] All right. listen.

1164
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:08.657
I know that we'’ve been having
all of these beautiful moments.

1165
00:50:08.831 --> 00:50:10.442
and I feel
very connected to you.

1166
00:50:10.616 --> 00:50:12.183
All of the things.

1167
00:50:12.357 --> 00:50:13.967
But now I'’ma have to
take all your money.

1168
00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:16.317
- Mmm.
- All in.

1169
00:50:16.491 --> 00:50:18.363
Okay.

1170
00:50:19.625 --> 00:50:20.539
Me too.

1171
00:50:21.931 --> 00:50:24.108
Oh.[Gugu] Well...

1172
00:50:25.935 --> 00:50:27.502
Sha-blam!

1173
00:50:27.676 --> 00:50:28.808
Oh. no.

1174
00:50:28.982 --> 00:50:30.288
Wait for the river.

1175
00:50:31.637 --> 00:50:32.855
Quad queens?

1176
00:50:34.596 --> 00:50:36.511
Yes!
You did it! Yes!

1177
00:50:36.685 --> 00:50:39.210
I'’m dead. I'’m totally dead.

1178
00:50:40.167 --> 00:50:41.821
I'’m totally dead. Okay.

1179
00:50:41.995 --> 00:50:43.475
Oh. my God.

1180
00:50:43.649 --> 00:50:44.911
Oh. my God.

1181
00:50:45.085 --> 00:50:46.217
You know what?

1182
00:50:46.391 --> 00:50:48.480
I think I'’m gonna
cash out. Okay.

1183
00:50:48.654 --> 00:50:50.438
Great. What charity
are you playing for?

1184
00:50:53.311 --> 00:50:55.878
It'’s a charity poker event.

1185
00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.358
Oh. my God.

1186
00:50:58.925 --> 00:51:00.622
-  Charity.
- Right.

1187
00:51:01.188 --> 00:51:02.146
Uh. Gugu?

1188
00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.930
- Mmm?
- What'’s your charity?

1189
00:51:04.104 --> 00:51:05.584
Broadway Cares.

1190
00:51:05.758 --> 00:51:08.065
Give all of my winnings
to Broadway Cares.

1191
00:51:08.239 --> 00:51:11.677
And I wanna thank everybody
for letting me play with you.

1192
00:51:11.851 --> 00:51:15.028
I had a fabulous time.

1193
00:51:15.202 --> 00:51:17.639
Ugh. Charity poker.

1194
00:51:17.813 --> 00:51:19.815
I wasn'’t gonna wear
a retainer for 18 months.

1195
00:51:19.989 --> 00:51:20.903
Right.

1196
00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:22.688
Doctor Wong was right.

1197
00:51:22.862 --> 00:51:24.559
and the teeth just
went right back to
where they started.

1198
00:51:24.733 --> 00:51:26.387
Oh. gosh. that'’s terrible.

1199
00:51:26.561 --> 00:51:30.087
Well. you gotta roll
with the punches. you know.

1200
00:51:30.261 --> 00:51:31.740
It'’s--

1201
00:51:31.914 --> 00:51:33.177
You don'’t understand
how hard dating is these days.

1202
00:51:33.351 --> 00:51:35.744
Oh. I can imagine.
I can imagine.

1203
00:51:35.918 --> 00:51:37.659
But let me just tell you this.

1204
00:51:37.833 --> 00:51:40.836
Listen to me right now.

1205
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:43.187
If you wanna find love...

1206
00:51:43.361 --> 00:51:48.061
...you have to focus
on the positive.
not the negative.

1207
00:51:48.235 --> 00:51:50.455
There'’s always negative things.

1208
00:51:50.629 --> 00:51:55.199
Honestly. if you see someone
you think is interesting.

1209
00:51:55.373 --> 00:51:57.592
you look them
right in the face.

1210
00:51:58.245 --> 00:51:59.551
and you say...

1211
00:52:02.423 --> 00:52:04.425
"I like the way you look."

1212
00:52:06.035 --> 00:52:07.776
Oh. no. not me![Lou] You too?

1213
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:09.735
What are you doing?

1214
00:52:09.909 --> 00:52:11.954
I don'’t know.
I don'’t know what I'’m doing.

1215
00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:14.740
- That'’s the problem.
- It'’s 1:00 a.m.

1216
00:52:14.914 --> 00:52:17.482
Does nobody care that
we don'’t have the tickets?

1217
00:52:17.656 --> 00:52:18.744
Lou. Lou. relax.

1218
00:52:18.918 --> 00:52:20.180
Oh. relax.

1219
00:52:20.354 --> 00:52:22.182
I should be relaxed
and in bed right now.

1220
00:52:22.356 --> 00:52:25.316
but I'’m not because
you'’re too busy gambling.

1221
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:28.406
And you care more about
some guy you just met

1222
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:30.321
than you do your friends.

1223
00:52:30.495 --> 00:52:32.975
And you should be
more responsible.

1224
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:35.848
but clearly
you don'’t give a damn.

1225
00:52:36.022 --> 00:52:39.112
I give a damn. I give a damn.
We'’ll find the tickets.

1226
00:52:39.286 --> 00:52:41.897
When? Tomorrow'’s the game.

1227
00:52:42.071 --> 00:52:45.205
Use that big brain of yours.

1228
00:52:45.379 --> 00:52:47.076
I thought you were
supposed to be the smart one.

1229
00:52:47.251 --> 00:52:48.513
What'’s going on?

1230
00:52:48.687 --> 00:52:51.820
No one knows how much
this trip means to me.

1231
00:52:52.778 --> 00:52:55.215
Well. that'’s just selfish.

1232
00:52:55.389 --> 00:52:56.999
It means a lot to all of us.

1233
00:52:57.174 --> 00:53:00.046
You know. I'’m tired.

1234
00:53:13.799 --> 00:53:16.062
We'’re gonna find
the tickets tomorrow.

1235
00:53:16.236 --> 00:53:19.239
We'’re gonna go to the hotel.
get a good night'’s sleep.

1236
00:53:19.413 --> 00:53:21.937
and wake up all fresh.

1237
00:53:27.682 --> 00:53:29.554
<i>Good morning
from Houston. Texas.</i>

1238
00:53:29.728 --> 00:53:33.949
<i>It'’s Super Bowl Sunday.
February 5. 2017.</i>

1239
00:53:34.123 --> 00:53:36.474
<i>the biggest stage in sports.</i>

1240
00:53:36.648 --> 00:53:38.998
<i>Patriots. Falcons.</i>

1241
00:53:39.172 --> 00:53:40.652
<i>Two storied franchises.</i>

1242
00:53:40.826 --> 00:53:42.480
<i>two inevitable fates. one--</i>

1243
00:53:47.441 --> 00:53:49.226
- Oh. my God.
- Oh. God.

1244
00:53:51.489 --> 00:53:52.490
Oh. my God. my head.

1245
00:53:52.664 --> 00:53:55.014
We all g--
We have to get up.

1246
00:53:55.188 --> 00:53:56.972
We have to find our tickets.

1247
00:53:57.146 --> 00:53:59.497
- I don'’t wanna get up.
- Oh. Oh. God.

1248
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:03.501
Why is champagne
such a violent beverage?

1249
00:54:03.675 --> 00:54:04.632
Shoot.

1250
00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:06.852
Lou. I'’m sorry.

1251
00:54:07.026 --> 00:54:08.636
It'’s my fault
as much as anybody'’s.

1252
00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:10.682
Come on. The game
doesn'’t start for a few hours.

1253
00:54:10.856 --> 00:54:12.031
We'’ll get tickets.

1254
00:54:12.205 --> 00:54:14.120
There'’s gotta be
a scalper somewhere.

1255
00:54:14.294 --> 00:54:16.862
All right. Let'’s meet
back here in an hour
in front of the stadium.

1256
00:54:17.036 --> 00:54:18.342
We'’ll all split up.

1257
00:54:18.516 --> 00:54:19.430
- Okay. Hour.
- In an hour.

1258
00:54:19.604 --> 00:54:20.561
In an hour.

1259
00:54:32.225 --> 00:54:33.444
Do you--

1260
00:54:33.618 --> 00:54:35.794
Do you know where
I could find a scalper?

1261
00:54:35.968 --> 00:54:38.579
- I don'’t think I can.
- Okay. okay. okay. Got it.

1262
00:54:39.841 --> 00:54:41.278
Hey. Has anybody got tickets?

1263
00:54:41.452 --> 00:54:43.323
Okay. sorry. Sorry.

1264
00:54:43.802 --> 00:54:44.846
Shit.

1265
00:54:59.992 --> 00:55:01.167
You a scalper?

1266
00:55:01.341 --> 00:55:02.560
No.

1267
00:55:02.734 --> 00:55:03.648
You a cop?

1268
00:55:03.822 --> 00:55:06.477
No. How much for four tickets?

1269
00:55:06.651 --> 00:55:07.826
Ten thousand.

1270
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.262
Ten thousand?

1271
00:55:09.436 --> 00:55:10.655
Per ticket.

1272
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:12.004
I'’ll tell you what.

1273
00:55:12.178 --> 00:55:15.224
I'’m willing to go
100 per ticket.

1274
00:55:15.399 --> 00:55:16.356
That'’s less than face value.

1275
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:17.575
175.

1276
00:55:17.749 --> 00:55:20.099
Move on.
I gotta find a real buyer.

1277
00:55:20.273 --> 00:55:21.709
- Will 200 happen?
- No.

1278
00:55:21.883 --> 00:55:24.277
You'’re not gonna accept
250 cash in hand?

1279
00:55:24.451 --> 00:55:26.105
What is wrong with you?

1280
00:55:26.279 --> 00:55:28.237
- I'’m offering 300.
- No.

1281
00:55:28.412 --> 00:55:30.022
- 450.
- No.

1282
00:55:30.196 --> 00:55:32.590
500 is my ceiling.
It'’s my ceiling.

1283
00:55:32.764 --> 00:55:34.548
525.

1284
00:55:34.722 --> 00:55:35.810
Come on. Get outta here. No.

1285
00:55:35.984 --> 00:55:37.464
You know what?

1286
00:55:37.638 --> 00:55:41.033
When you are stuck at halftime
with those tickets.

1287
00:55:41.207 --> 00:55:45.167
I'’m gonna lowball
the shit outta you.
you son of a bitch.

1288
00:55:47.779 --> 00:55:48.736
550.

1289
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:50.782
If my bookie were listening.

1290
00:55:50.956 --> 00:55:53.654
I would tell him
to put me down for.
like. five large...

1291
00:55:53.828 --> 00:55:56.744
Whoa....that the Pats
take it by 14.

1292
00:55:56.918 --> 00:55:58.790
All right? But I don'’t
have a bookie. so--Right.

1293
00:55:58.964 --> 00:56:00.531
Well. hey.
you heard him. Mike.

1294
00:56:00.705 --> 00:56:02.141
You heard that.
We'’re gonna be right back.

1295
00:56:02.315 --> 00:56:03.795
Stick around.

1296
00:56:03.969 --> 00:56:06.754
You can'’t blow up Mike
like that on the show.

1297
00:56:06.928 --> 00:56:08.408
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

1298
00:56:08.582 --> 00:56:11.193
Yeah--
We know each other. right?

1299
00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:12.499
God. you look very familiar.

1300
00:56:14.283 --> 00:56:15.807
Well. I was
- the Mayflower Girl.
- That'’s it.

1301
00:56:15.981 --> 00:56:17.504
- Yeah. you were!
- Oh. my God!

1302
00:56:17.678 --> 00:56:19.245
From the commercials
- when we were kids.
- Yeah. I know.

1303
00:56:19.419 --> 00:56:22.248
<i>♪ Tires. parts
And new cars too♪</i>

1304
00:56:22.422 --> 00:56:23.597
<i>♪ We got it all-- ♪</i>

1305
00:56:23.771 --> 00:56:25.512
Are you gonna do
the whole thing?

1306
00:56:25.686 --> 00:56:28.341
I had a humongous thing for you
when I was about ten.

1307
00:56:28.515 --> 00:56:30.299
All right.
- Too much. Too much.
- Thank you.

1308
00:56:30.474 --> 00:56:32.519
That'’s very kind. Thank you.

1309
00:56:33.259 --> 00:56:34.608
Actually. I need your help.

1310
00:56:34.782 --> 00:56:36.567
See. my friend won
the tickets at your giveaway.

1311
00:56:36.741 --> 00:56:38.395
and now we'’ve lost them.

1312
00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:39.787
Uh... I don'’t--

1313
00:56:39.961 --> 00:56:41.267
Your-- Your friend
won the ticket giveaway?

1314
00:56:41.441 --> 00:56:43.095
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. I don'’t--

1315
00:56:43.269 --> 00:56:46.011
'’Cause these guys
won the tickets.[Pat] Yeah.

1316
00:56:46.185 --> 00:56:47.012
They won the tickets?

1317
00:56:47.186 --> 00:56:48.361
Yeah.[Nat] Uh-huh.

1318
00:56:48.535 --> 00:56:50.276
That'’s the Tom Brady
Support Group.

1319
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:51.669
They support Tom Brady?

1320
00:56:51.843 --> 00:56:54.585
No. They'’re all men
named Tom Brady

1321
00:56:54.759 --> 00:56:56.238
who formed a support group

1322
00:56:56.413 --> 00:56:58.110
because they'’re never gonna
live up to that name.

1323
00:56:58.284 --> 00:56:59.677
Are they even Pats fans?

1324
00:56:59.851 --> 00:57:01.766
They'’re conflicted
about it. let'’s say.

1325
00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.463
They seem reluctantly
- like they'’re supporting '’em.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1326
00:57:03.637 --> 00:57:04.943
Yeah. They came.

1327
00:57:05.117 --> 00:57:07.032
Oh.

1328
00:57:07.815 --> 00:57:08.903
Oh. oh. oh. oh.

1329
00:57:10.731 --> 00:57:12.429
Hi. sweetie.

1330
00:57:12.603 --> 00:57:14.213
<i>Okay. I was trying not to
bother you too much.</i>

1331
00:57:14.387 --> 00:57:15.954
<i>but. uh. which one?</i>

1332
00:57:16.128 --> 00:57:17.303
What?

1333
00:57:17.477 --> 00:57:19.218
I sent you an e-mail
with two options.

1334
00:57:19.392 --> 00:57:20.306
A or B?

1335
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.177
What are you talking about?

1336
00:57:22.351 --> 00:57:23.527
<i>My paper.</i>

1337
00:57:23.701 --> 00:57:25.877
Oh. Oh. I didn'’t read it.

1338
00:57:26.051 --> 00:57:28.880
Are-- Are you close
to a computer?
Can you find a Kinko'’s?

1339
00:57:29.054 --> 00:57:30.751
No. No. I--

1340
00:57:30.925 --> 00:57:32.666
I am not going to read it.

1341
00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.148
Well. are you just hungry?

1342
00:57:36.322 --> 00:57:38.063
<i>No. for God'’s sakes. Mark.</i>

1343
00:57:38.237 --> 00:57:41.370
I'’m not hungry.
I'’m at the Super Bowl
with my friends.

1344
00:57:41.545 --> 00:57:43.503
<i>But this is really important.</i>

1345
00:57:43.677 --> 00:57:46.985
To you it is.
To you. Not to me.

1346
00:57:47.159 --> 00:57:50.467
Honestly. it'’s your paper
with your name on it.

1347
00:57:50.641 --> 00:57:52.294
You have to make the decisions.

1348
00:57:56.385 --> 00:57:57.778
Mark. are you still there?

1349
00:57:59.954 --> 00:58:01.390
Yeah.

1350
00:58:01.565 --> 00:58:02.566
<i>Listen.</i>

1351
00:58:03.392 --> 00:58:04.785
<i>Honey. I--</i>

1352
00:58:04.959 --> 00:58:06.744
I have made a lot of sacrifices
over the years.

1353
00:58:06.918 --> 00:58:10.225
and I'’m not saying I wish
I could change any of that.

1354
00:58:10.399 --> 00:58:14.012
I'’m just saying just because
I can solve a problem

1355
00:58:14.186 --> 00:58:16.405
does not mean I should have to.

1356
00:58:18.407 --> 00:58:19.452
Okay.

1357
00:58:22.586 --> 00:58:23.935
I love our life.

1358
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:26.154
I love our kids
and our grandkids.

1359
00:58:26.764 --> 00:58:27.765
I love you.

1360
00:58:29.767 --> 00:58:31.116
I love you too.

1361
00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:33.814
<i>I'’m sorry. Have a great time.</i>

1362
00:58:33.988 --> 00:58:34.989
Okay.

1363
00:58:35.163 --> 00:58:36.382
<i>Okay.</i> Okay.

1364
00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:46.871
Found it! I found it!
I found it! I found it!

1365
00:58:47.045 --> 00:58:50.004
What can I get for you?[chuckles] Oh. is--
is Guy here?

1366
00:58:50.178 --> 00:58:51.963
- Oh. damn. It'’s you.
- Hi.

1367
00:58:52.137 --> 00:58:53.834
- How are you?
- Good.

1368
00:58:54.008 --> 00:58:55.270
How'’s your bowels?

1369
00:58:55.444 --> 00:58:57.621
That'’s none
- of your business.
- Okay.

1370
00:58:57.795 --> 00:58:59.144
I haven'’t seen Guy in a while.

1371
00:58:59.318 --> 00:59:00.493
I think he might be
in the office.

1372
00:59:00.667 --> 00:59:02.016
Where'’s the office?

1373
00:59:05.367 --> 00:59:06.499
Good luck.

1374
00:59:06.673 --> 00:59:08.153
Mr. Fieri.

1375
00:59:08.327 --> 00:59:10.634
Mr. Fieri? Mr. Fieri--

1376
00:59:10.808 --> 00:59:13.158
-  Oh. hi.
- Oh. God. Sorry.

1377
00:59:13.332 --> 00:59:14.812
Mr. Fieri?

1378
00:59:14.986 --> 00:59:16.553
Mr. Fieri?

1379
00:59:16.727 --> 00:59:17.728
Mr. Fieri?

1380
00:59:18.729 --> 00:59:20.034
Guy!

1381
00:59:20.208 --> 00:59:21.296
Yeah?

1382
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:23.298
Oh. thank God. Thank God.

1383
00:59:23.472 --> 00:59:26.432
Mr. Fieri. I'’m sorry.
I think you have my strap-on.

1384
00:59:26.606 --> 00:59:28.129
Hang-- Hang on a second.

1385
00:59:29.174 --> 00:59:31.045
Oh. Oh. thank God.

1386
00:59:31.219 --> 00:59:32.307
Oh. Betty. it'’s you.

1387
00:59:32.481 --> 00:59:33.526
I was expecting
someone else.

1388
00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.789
No. I think
you have my strap-on.

1389
00:59:35.963 --> 00:59:39.445
You know. I took off
during the competition.

1390
00:59:42.274 --> 00:59:43.405
- Your fanny pack.
- Yes.

1391
00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.494
- Your fanny pack.
- Yes. It went this way.

1392
00:59:45.669 --> 00:59:49.281
So you don'’t have any tickets
to get into the actual game?

1393
00:59:49.455 --> 00:59:51.544
No. No.
the tickets are lost.

1394
00:59:51.718 --> 00:59:53.328
Did you try the lost and found?

1395
00:59:53.502 --> 00:59:55.243
- No. no. Where is that?
- Okay.

1396
00:59:55.417 --> 00:59:56.941
Um...

1397
00:59:57.115 --> 00:59:59.639
I don'’t know.
- actually. where that is.
- Oh. G--

1398
00:59:59.813 --> 01:00:02.076
There'’s got to be some way.

1399
01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:05.340
If you don'’t have the tickets.
then you don'’t have a--

1400
01:00:05.514 --> 01:00:07.212
<i>It'’s one of those moments</i>

1401
01:00:07.386 --> 01:00:09.040
<i>where all the work
that you put in</i>

1402
01:00:09.214 --> 01:00:10.258
<i>has brought you
to this moment.</i>

1403
01:00:10.432 --> 01:00:11.695
<i>And it'’s okay to be behind.</i>

1404
01:00:11.869 --> 01:00:13.087
<i>'’cause you gotta
remind yourself</i>

1405
01:00:13.261 --> 01:00:14.785
<i>that it'’s all gonna work out.</i>

1406
01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:17.309
No. Tom. I don'’t think
it'’s going to work out.

1407
01:00:17.483 --> 01:00:18.919
They'’re not going to let us in.

1408
01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:21.748
<i>Lou. whenever I'’m down.</i>

1409
01:00:21.922 --> 01:00:23.271
<i>I say to myself.</i>

1410
01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:26.710
<i>"This is going to be
an amazing comeback.</i>

1411
01:00:26.884 --> 01:00:28.668
<i>When we come back from this.</i>

1412
01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:31.540
<i>this is going to be
a defining moment in my life."</i>

1413
01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:34.413
<i>You have to shift your mind
to think that way.</i>

1414
01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:35.893
<i>It'’s empowering.</i>

1415
01:00:36.067 --> 01:00:37.242
<i>Say it.</i>

1416
01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:39.766
<i>This is going to work out.</i>

1417
01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:43.204
This is gonna work out.

1418
01:00:43.378 --> 01:00:45.163
<i>Come on. Lou.
Like you mean it.</i>

1419
01:00:45.337 --> 01:00:47.121
<i>This is going to work out.</i>

1420
01:00:47.295 --> 01:00:50.124
This is gonna work out!

1421
01:00:53.562 --> 01:00:55.042
- Lou! Lou!
- Oh. my God.

1422
01:00:55.216 --> 01:00:56.653
I found them!
I found them.

1423
01:00:56.827 --> 01:00:59.351
We got the tickets!
We got the tickets!

1424
01:00:59.525 --> 01:01:00.918
- We got the tickets.
- You got the tickets.

1425
01:01:01.092 --> 01:01:02.267
- I got '’em.
- Oh. my God!

1426
01:01:02.441 --> 01:01:04.008
- I got '’em!
- Oh. my God!

1427
01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:06.053
Oh.
- we got to go in now.
- Isn'’t that great?

1428
01:01:06.227 --> 01:01:08.316
Now. Come on.
- Let'’s go.
- Yeah. great. Oh. my God.

1429
01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:09.709
Games. everybody.
Everybody have a ticket?

1430
01:01:09.883 --> 01:01:11.363
- Everybody take their ticket.
- Come on.

1431
01:01:11.537 --> 01:01:14.018
We'’ve got our tickets.
We'’ve got our tickets.

1432
01:01:14.975 --> 01:01:17.151
Oh. my God. This is it.

1433
01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.112
- We did it.
- We did do this.

1434
01:01:22.287 --> 01:01:23.680
Next. Come on.

1435
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:26.465
- Hi. welcome.
- Hi.

1436
01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.251
Oh. Uh...

1437
01:01:30.425 --> 01:01:33.167
Are you guys all together?
This is--

1438
01:01:33.341 --> 01:01:35.213
These aren'’t-- These--

1439
01:01:35.387 --> 01:01:37.476
I'’m sorry. these all
aren'’t Super Bowl tickets. so--

1440
01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:39.478
Yes. those are our tickets.

1441
01:01:39.652 --> 01:01:41.480
That'’s great. but
they'’re not Super Bowl tickets.

1442
01:01:41.654 --> 01:01:43.482
Chip.
- I got another one here.
- Comin'’.

1443
01:01:43.656 --> 01:01:45.266
Hot one.[Chip] Let me see.

1444
01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.486
Four.

1445
01:01:48.617 --> 01:01:50.619
- Yep. they'’re fake.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1446
01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:52.970
You see. ladies.
the official tickets
have a hologram

1447
01:01:53.144 --> 01:01:55.189
that lights up under UV light.

1448
01:01:55.363 --> 01:01:57.496
These do not.
You'’ve been scammed.

1449
01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.281
Well. that'’s not possible.
We won them in a contest.

1450
01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:01.761
No. we didn'’t.

1451
01:02:01.935 --> 01:02:03.110
Lou. tell '’em.

1452
01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.944
I never won the contest.

1453
01:02:11.118 --> 01:02:13.686
A whole bunch
of Tom Brady wannabes did.

1454
01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.732
How'’d you get the tickets?

1455
01:02:16.776 --> 01:02:18.212
I bought them online.

1456
01:02:19.823 --> 01:02:23.522
I maxed out a credit card.
and I sold my car to CarMax.

1457
01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:27.004
Oh. Lou.
why would you do that?

1458
01:02:29.049 --> 01:02:33.010
I wanted to have one last
unforgettable experience

1459
01:02:34.141 --> 01:02:35.839
before it was too late.

1460
01:02:36.013 --> 01:02:38.232
Hey. little ladies.
I'’m gonna need you
to move aside.

1461
01:02:38.406 --> 01:02:39.886
We gotta let other people
through the gate.

1462
01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.801
Well. you can start by
letting us through.

1463
01:02:41.975 --> 01:02:43.672
- Oh. you'’re not getting in.
- Oh!

1464
01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:46.066
Wha--[Trish] Oh.

1465
01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.589
When you do a double.
- they get thick.
- I got you.

1466
01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:48.808
Let'’s make a run.

1467
01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:49.940
- Whoa. No.
- Hey. Wait.

1468
01:02:50.114 --> 01:02:52.203
- Maura. No.
- Come on. ma'’am.

1469
01:02:52.377 --> 01:02:54.596
- No. no. She-- Come on.
- Come on. I'’m not hurting her.
I am not hurting her.

1470
01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:55.859
- We know you'’re not.
- Don'’t touch me!

1471
01:02:56.033 --> 01:02:57.338
- She'’s coming at me.
- Come on.

1472
01:02:57.512 --> 01:02:59.253
Okay. Fine. fine. fine.

1473
01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:03.388
Lou. where are you going?

1474
01:03:03.562 --> 01:03:07.218
Louella. talk to us.
What is going on?

1475
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:10.830
Lou. look at me.

1476
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:13.615
What did you mean
when you said

1477
01:03:15.182 --> 01:03:16.793
"before it'’s too late"?

1478
01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:22.668
I had some tests done.

1479
01:03:22.842 --> 01:03:24.801
and the hospital'’s been
trying to reach me.

1480
01:03:27.194 --> 01:03:29.370
I think maybe
something came up.

1481
01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:31.329
Oh. Lou.

1482
01:03:31.503 --> 01:03:33.200
What did they say?

1483
01:03:33.374 --> 01:03:34.767
I don'’t know. I--

1484
01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:36.421
They sent me a letter.
but I haven'’t opened it.

1485
01:03:36.595 --> 01:03:37.552
Well. open it.

1486
01:03:37.726 --> 01:03:39.032
No. what if it'’s come back?

1487
01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:41.295
I-- I can'’t
go through that again.

1488
01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:50.261
Oh. Lou.
You'’re not alone.

1489
01:03:50.435 --> 01:03:52.437
We'’re here for you. Always.

1490
01:03:52.611 --> 01:03:55.005
We'’re all here
to support you.

1491
01:03:56.354 --> 01:03:57.877
Isn'’t that
what friendship is?

1492
01:03:58.051 --> 01:03:59.487
I mean.

1493
01:03:59.661 --> 01:04:03.230
that we face
the unknown together.
hand in hand?

1494
01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.804
I wouldn'’t wanna go through it
with anyone else.

1495
01:04:11.978 --> 01:04:13.632
I really love you all.

1496
01:04:22.467 --> 01:04:24.904
I guess maybe this Super Bowl
was never meant to be.

1497
01:04:25.078 --> 01:04:26.906
Oh. come on. Lou.

1498
01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.213
If you did this to give us
something to remember.

1499
01:04:29.387 --> 01:04:31.432
honey. it worked.

1500
01:04:31.606 --> 01:04:32.607
Big time.

1501
01:04:32.781 --> 01:04:34.348
We will always remember this.

1502
01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:36.220
Absolutely.

1503
01:04:36.394 --> 01:04:40.441
This has been
the best weekend
of my whole life.

1504
01:04:40.615 --> 01:04:42.835
I'’m not kidding you.
The very. very best.

1505
01:04:43.749 --> 01:04:45.577
Well. except for
the guilt I felt

1506
01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:47.666
because I lost the tickets.
which were fake.

1507
01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.496
And so. in retrospect.
I didn'’t have to feel
that guilty. Did I?

1508
01:04:56.718 --> 01:04:59.243
Oh. hell.
There must be a sports bar
around here somewhere.

1509
01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:01.854
No. no.
No. no. no. no. God.

1510
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:05.902
There'’s got to be
a way into that stadium.

1511
01:05:06.076 --> 01:05:07.425
Come on.
We'’re not gonna give up.

1512
01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:08.992
We'’ve come too far.

1513
01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:11.342
No. we are not gonna
stand around this food court.

1514
01:05:11.516 --> 01:05:13.735
crying like
a bunch of babies.

1515
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:17.087
- Gugu.
- Yeah. Goo-goo. gaga.

1516
01:05:17.261 --> 01:05:18.218
No.

1517
01:05:18.392 --> 01:05:19.524
Gugu!

1518
01:05:19.698 --> 01:05:20.655
- Hold on.
- Gugu. Hi.

1519
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:22.309
- Hey.
- Come on. Come on.

1520
01:05:22.483 --> 01:05:24.007
Maura. How are you. ladies?

1521
01:05:24.181 --> 01:05:25.965
- Y'’all look fabulous.
- Thank you.

1522
01:05:26.139 --> 01:05:27.619
I wanted to thank you properly
for last night.

1523
01:05:27.793 --> 01:05:28.750
but you ran out so fast.

1524
01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.143
Y'’all ran out.

1525
01:05:30.317 --> 01:05:32.319
Your donation was so beautiful.
Thank you.

1526
01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:34.495
You'’re welcome.
I was happy to do it.

1527
01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:36.628
Are you. um...
Are you going into the game?

1528
01:05:36.802 --> 01:05:37.890
Of course.

1529
01:05:38.064 --> 01:05:39.326
I choreographed
the halftime show.

1530
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.199
Oh. you'’re--
You work with Lady Gaga?

1531
01:05:42.373 --> 01:05:43.635
I do everything
with that girl.

1532
01:05:43.809 --> 01:05:45.724
Where you think
she got her name from?

1533
01:05:45.898 --> 01:05:48.770
I'’m Gugu. she'’s Gaga.

1534
01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:51.121
- Oh. she'’s spectacular.
- She is.

1535
01:05:51.295 --> 01:05:53.036
Do you think
you could get us in?

1536
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:54.515
Uh. yeah.
we don'’t have tickets.

1537
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:59.651
Come on. ladies. Follow me.

1538
01:05:59.825 --> 01:06:02.045
- Go. go. go.
- Come on.

1539
01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:06.527
- Hey. there. How are ya?
- Doin'’ all right.

1540
01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:08.877
Hold on.
- Let me see your badges.
- No. No.

1541
01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:11.880
They'’re with me. They'’re good.
These are my dancers.

1542
01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:13.578
They don'’t
look like dancers.

1543
01:06:13.752 --> 01:06:15.928
Well. that'’s ageist.
Isn'’t it?

1544
01:06:16.102 --> 01:06:17.321
I don'’t care
how old they are.

1545
01:06:17.495 --> 01:06:19.279
They just need badges
like these dancers.

1546
01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:20.977
Holy shit.[Trish] Flexible.

1547
01:06:21.151 --> 01:06:23.892
Well. uh.
they'’re all my dancers.

1548
01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:26.721
I mean... [scoffs] What?
You want us to show you?

1549
01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:28.593
Okay.

1550
01:06:29.681 --> 01:06:32.031
Okay. Um...
Y'’all got this. Come on.

1551
01:06:32.205 --> 01:06:33.641
Come on. Let'’s talk
about this for a second.

1552
01:06:34.338 --> 01:06:35.687
Okay. Um...

1553
01:06:35.861 --> 01:06:37.994
So what are some dance moves
you ladies know?

1554
01:06:38.168 --> 01:06:39.865
- The twist.
- Twist.

1555
01:06:40.039 --> 01:06:41.562
The jerk.[Lou] Sh-- Shimmy.

1556
01:06:41.736 --> 01:06:43.782
Yeah. uh. step-touch.

1557
01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:47.916
All right.
So we'’ll do the step-touch.
the twist. the shimmy.

1558
01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:49.396
and then we'’ll end
with some jazz hands.

1559
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:50.441
- How'’s that?
- Oh. yeah.

1560
01:06:50.615 --> 01:06:51.529
Okay?[Trish] Yes.

1561
01:06:51.703 --> 01:06:53.052
One. two. three.[all] Break!

1562
01:06:53.226 --> 01:06:54.358
All right. Let'’s do it.

1563
01:06:55.881 --> 01:06:58.101
Y'’all ready?
A little freestyle here.

1564
01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:03.062
And five. six. seven.

1565
01:07:03.236 --> 01:07:06.326
<i>♪ It'’s my--
And I live here♪</i>

1566
01:07:08.154 --> 01:07:10.765
<i>♪ It'’s my house and I-- ♪</i>

1567
01:07:10.939 --> 01:07:12.071
There you go.

1568
01:07:12.245 --> 01:07:13.551
Oh!

1569
01:07:22.255 --> 01:07:23.996
Oh! And...

1570
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:25.519
Freestyle. ladies.

1571
01:07:26.433 --> 01:07:29.045
Freestyle. ladies.
Come on down.

1572
01:07:33.005 --> 01:07:34.789
Y'’all did so good!

1573
01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:38.402
Five. six. seven and hold!

1574
01:07:43.015 --> 01:07:44.408
Damn. ladies.

1575
01:07:44.582 --> 01:07:46.584
Those were
some sick dance moves.

1576
01:07:46.758 --> 01:07:50.283
I know you'’re not his dancers.
but that was awesome.

1577
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:52.503
Go ahead.

1578
01:07:53.808 --> 01:07:55.332
Extraordinary!

1579
01:07:55.506 --> 01:07:58.117
We have to go to work.
- It'’s been lovely.
- Okay.

1580
01:07:58.291 --> 01:08:01.164
Y'’all better fluff up
'’cause these ladies
are about to take your gig.

1581
01:08:01.338 --> 01:08:02.339
Come on. kids!

1582
01:08:02.513 --> 01:08:03.514
-  Thank you.
- Let'’s go.

1583
01:08:03.688 --> 01:08:05.472
- Yo. how good were they?
- Amazing.

1584
01:08:05.646 --> 01:08:06.821
Good lord.

1585
01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:41.117
<i>In three. two. one!</i>

1586
01:08:55.174 --> 01:08:56.915
Okay. where to?

1587
01:08:57.089 --> 01:08:58.438
Um...

1588
01:08:58.612 --> 01:09:01.485
Oh! Oh!
Empty seats right there.

1589
01:09:01.659 --> 01:09:02.834
- Let'’s go up there.
- Yeah.

1590
01:09:03.008 --> 01:09:04.401
- All right.
- Super Bowl 51.

1591
01:09:04.575 --> 01:09:08.622
Pats Nation.
welcome to Super Bowl LI.Welcome.

1592
01:09:10.537 --> 01:09:12.931
<i>There'’s the kickoff
and we are underway.</i>

1593
01:09:13.105 --> 01:09:15.412
- It'’s Tom. It'’s Tom.
- Okay. Where?

1594
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.371
Do our job now.
Let'’s do our job!

1595
01:09:18.545 --> 01:09:22.984
I think this is
the best sitting down
has ever felt.

1596
01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:30.470
<i>Third and long.
Tom Brady'’s in the--</i>

1597
01:09:30.644 --> 01:09:32.733
<i>Oh. God! He'’s sacked.</i>[Nat] <i>God.</i>

1598
01:09:32.907 --> 01:09:34.648
What the hell was that?

1599
01:09:34.822 --> 01:09:36.824
<i>We are still scoreless
in the first quarter.</i>

1600
01:09:41.438 --> 01:09:42.830
Who keeps texting you?

1601
01:09:43.483 --> 01:09:45.006
Oh. it'’s-- it'’s Dan.

1602
01:09:46.007 --> 01:09:47.705
Well. why-- why
don'’t you answer him?

1603
01:09:49.315 --> 01:09:51.230
I don'’t know.
I'’m ghosting him.

1604
01:09:52.013 --> 01:09:53.580
You know. he keeps calling...

1605
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.631
...but I know
how this works out.

1606
01:10:00.805 --> 01:10:01.806
He'’s--

1607
01:10:03.068 --> 01:10:05.592
He'’s gonna be charming.
I'’m gonna fall for it.

1608
01:10:05.766 --> 01:10:07.203
It'’s gonna all move too fast.

1609
01:10:07.377 --> 01:10:10.206
and then everything'’s gonna
come crashing down.

1610
01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:14.471
You realize ignoring him
is just gonna make him
want you more?

1611
01:10:14.645 --> 01:10:17.300
I mean. look at you.
Honestly. and who you are.

1612
01:10:17.474 --> 01:10:20.303
You'’re always
pushing forward
and doing new things.

1613
01:10:20.477 --> 01:10:22.218
Well... You'’re irresistible.

1614
01:10:22.392 --> 01:10:24.829
You know. honestly.
I don'’t want to be.

1615
01:10:25.003 --> 01:10:26.831
I don'’t wanna be irresistible.

1616
01:10:27.005 --> 01:10:29.312
I'’d like five grandkids
like you have.

1617
01:10:30.704 --> 01:10:33.229
Guess it'’s a little late
- for that.
- Yeah. I guess so.

1618
01:10:33.403 --> 01:10:36.971
I want a man I can sit next to
and not have to talk.

1619
01:10:37.145 --> 01:10:39.757
Well. you can have Mark.
He'’s real good at that.

1620
01:10:39.931 --> 01:10:41.933
Well. I'’d take him.

1621
01:10:42.107 --> 01:10:43.935
but he'’s too much
in love with you.

1622
01:10:44.109 --> 01:10:46.677
Look. that'’s us!
Oh. my God!

1623
01:10:50.985 --> 01:10:52.248
Yay. yay. yay!

1624
01:10:52.422 --> 01:10:56.513
Tom Brady. we love you!
Look down there.

1625
01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:59.559
<i>Let'’s hear it for
our Super Bowl superfans!</i>

1626
01:10:59.733 --> 01:11:02.040
<i>My goodness.
I wish I had those hips.</i>

1627
01:11:02.214 --> 01:11:04.869
Not on me. not on my watch!

1628
01:11:05.043 --> 01:11:06.914
...never been so--
- Sit down.
- Tom. spank me.

1629
01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:09.787
Right here.
Spank me here. Tom.[Betty] Oh. no. Get. get--

1630
01:11:10.918 --> 01:11:13.530
Sit down. Oh. my God.
I'’m so embarrassed.

1631
01:11:13.704 --> 01:11:15.706
The Falcons have no business
being in this contest.

1632
01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.099
<i>I mean.
it'’s gonna be a bloodbath.</i>

1633
01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.014
<i>Oh. come on!
Get him! Get him!</i>

1634
01:11:20.188 --> 01:11:21.929
<i>Damn it!</i>

1635
01:11:22.103 --> 01:11:23.801
<i>Atlanta with the first
touchdown of the game.</i> Nice!

1636
01:11:23.975 --> 01:11:25.846
<i>Bryant. the extra point.</i>

1637
01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.413
<i>7-nothing to Atlanta.</i>

1638
01:11:28.806 --> 01:11:29.981
Hey!

1639
01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:31.069
Let'’s go.

1640
01:11:31.243 --> 01:11:33.506
Out of the seats. Now.

1641
01:11:35.116 --> 01:11:36.466
Come on.

1642
01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.555
Let'’s go. Golden Girls.
Let'’s do this.

1643
01:11:38.729 --> 01:11:41.253
Now. I don'’t know how you ladies
got into this stadium.

1644
01:11:41.427 --> 01:11:43.081
but I know
how you'’re getting out.

1645
01:11:43.255 --> 01:11:44.169
Chip.

1646
01:11:44.343 --> 01:11:45.257
Oh. God.

1647
01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:46.476
Trish?

1648
01:11:47.259 --> 01:11:48.173
Dan.

1649
01:11:48.347 --> 01:11:50.001
I saw you on the Jumbotron.

1650
01:11:50.175 --> 01:11:51.611
You weren'’t answering my texts.

1651
01:11:52.873 --> 01:11:55.180
I was--
I was very preoccupied.

1652
01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:56.616
Dan O'’Callahan?

1653
01:11:58.705 --> 01:12:01.491
When you caught
that 90-yard touchdown
pass against the Oilers!

1654
01:12:01.665 --> 01:12:02.883
Poetry.

1655
01:12:03.057 --> 01:12:05.625
I mean. devastating for me
as an Oilers fan

1656
01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:07.497
- but poetry.
- Thank you.

1657
01:12:07.671 --> 01:12:09.847
- Dan. he'’s kicking us out.
- What?

1658
01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:11.718
Well. yeah.
They don'’t have tickets.

1659
01:12:11.892 --> 01:12:13.633
Well. they'’re in the box
with me.

1660
01:12:15.026 --> 01:12:16.157
See you. Chip.

1661
01:12:20.248 --> 01:12:21.293
Ready?

1662
01:12:30.868 --> 01:12:31.956
Wow.

1663
01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:34.437
This is how
people watch football?

1664
01:12:35.133 --> 01:12:36.221
This is heaven.

1665
01:12:36.395 --> 01:12:38.658
I know.
It'’s called a skybox.

1666
01:12:38.832 --> 01:12:40.965
I'’m sorry
I was angry with you

1667
01:12:41.139 --> 01:12:44.490
for hooking up with him
in that broom closet.

1668
01:12:44.664 --> 01:12:46.013
I'’m glad you did.

1669
01:12:46.187 --> 01:12:47.188
We were just kissing.

1670
01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.408
Come on.
Let'’s see the view.

1671
01:12:50.627 --> 01:12:52.498
Maybe this is heaven.

1672
01:12:52.672 --> 01:12:54.239
Oh. look at this.

1673
01:12:54.413 --> 01:12:56.284
You get such a great sense
of the whole field from up here.

1674
01:12:56.459 --> 01:12:58.635
You can see everything.

1675
01:12:58.809 --> 01:12:59.940
Exactly. Hey.

1676
01:13:00.114 --> 01:13:02.334
You see that box
right across the way?

1677
01:13:02.508 --> 01:13:04.684
That'’s the coordinator'’s booth.[Lou] That'’s where
they call the plays.

1678
01:13:04.858 --> 01:13:07.774
Wait. you mean
those guys are talking
directly to Tom Brady?

1679
01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:09.950
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh. what a dream.

1680
01:13:10.124 --> 01:13:11.430
Hey. grab a seat.

1681
01:13:11.604 --> 01:13:13.693
Let me know
- if you need anything.
- Yeah.

1682
01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:19.569
Dan. I'’m sorry
I didn'’t call you back.

1683
01:13:19.743 --> 01:13:21.266
It'’s just--

1684
01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:25.183
Sometimes I have a tendency
to go too quickly. you know?

1685
01:13:25.357 --> 01:13:27.054
That'’s okay. I get it.

1686
01:13:28.273 --> 01:13:29.796
There'’s no pressure.

1687
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:32.799
Let'’s spend some time together.
see what happens.

1688
01:13:38.805 --> 01:13:40.851
Hey. Mickey. <i>Hey.</i>

1689
01:13:41.025 --> 01:13:42.809
Um. listen.

1690
01:13:42.983 --> 01:13:45.072
Some people around here.
they'’ve been asking about you.

1691
01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:48.336
Some are under the impression
that you'’ve been kidnapped.
you know.

1692
01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:50.904
so they questioned me
for about three hours.

1693
01:13:51.078 --> 01:13:53.254
Of course. I'’m no snitch.
you know that.

1694
01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.995
Thank you.
That'’s really nice.

1695
01:13:55.169 --> 01:13:57.345
but I don'’t want
anybody to worry.

1696
01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.260
You can be a snitch.
Go ahead.

1697
01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:01.045
Okay.

1698
01:14:01.219 --> 01:14:03.003
<i>So. when are you coming back?</i>

1699
01:14:03.177 --> 01:14:04.440
<i>Some of the residents
around here.</i>

1700
01:14:04.614 --> 01:14:08.008
they'’ve been. uh.
been eyeing your room.

1701
01:14:08.182 --> 01:14:10.228
You know. I'’ve been
trying to keep them away.

1702
01:14:10.402 --> 01:14:12.186
but they'’re like vultures.
you know?

1703
01:14:13.666 --> 01:14:14.928
You know what. Mickey?

1704
01:14:16.364 --> 01:14:17.627
Tell them they can have it.

1705
01:14:18.845 --> 01:14:20.543
Does that mean you'’re leaving?

1706
01:14:20.717 --> 01:14:22.414
<i>I'’m moving back to my house.</i>

1707
01:14:22.588 --> 01:14:24.938
<i>but you can come over
whenever you want.</i>

1708
01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:26.592
Oh.

1709
01:14:29.073 --> 01:14:30.161
Yeah. Sure.

1710
01:14:30.335 --> 01:14:31.467
<i>Go Pats. huh?</i>

1711
01:14:31.641 --> 01:14:33.120
Go Pats!

1712
01:14:33.294 --> 01:14:36.776
<i>Second quarter.
still 0-7. Falcons leading.</i>

1713
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:38.212
<i>And...</i>

1714
01:14:38.386 --> 01:14:39.779
<i>...that'’s not gonna do it.</i>

1715
01:14:41.651 --> 01:14:44.741
Hey. what do you think
a box like this costs?

1716
01:14:44.915 --> 01:14:46.743
245.000.

1717
01:14:46.917 --> 01:14:48.135
No.

1718
01:14:48.309 --> 01:14:49.833
- You wanna bet?
- Yeah.

1719
01:14:50.007 --> 01:14:52.270
What kind of buffoon
would spend all that money?

1720
01:14:53.532 --> 01:14:54.533
Me.

1721
01:14:56.013 --> 01:14:57.014
- Oh. really?
- Mm-hmm.

1722
01:14:57.188 --> 01:14:59.059
Well. thank you
for having me.

1723
01:14:59.233 --> 01:15:01.801
Well. I don'’t know who you are.
but I'’m glad you could make it.

1724
01:15:02.672 --> 01:15:03.716
You'’re welcome.

1725
01:15:05.065 --> 01:15:06.632
<i>Ryan drops back.
protection holds up.</i>

1726
01:15:06.806 --> 01:15:07.938
<i>He lets it fly.</i>

1727
01:15:08.112 --> 01:15:10.854
<i>End zone.
touchdown. Austin Hooper.</i>

1728
01:15:11.028 --> 01:15:13.465
<i>Falcons.
now a two-touchdown lead.</i>

1729
01:15:14.031 --> 01:15:14.945
You stink!

1730
01:15:15.119 --> 01:15:16.642
Yeah. you tell '’em.

1731
01:15:16.816 --> 01:15:18.905
- Hooper touchdown.
- Who the hell is this guy?
Come on.

1732
01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:22.953
<i>Brady looks. throws.</i>

1733
01:15:23.127 --> 01:15:24.737
<i>And it'’s picked! Oh!</i>

1734
01:15:24.911 --> 01:15:27.044
<i>Intercepted by Robert Alford.</i>

1735
01:15:28.785 --> 01:15:32.876
<i>It'’s officially
an 82-yard pick-six
for Rocky Alford.</i>

1736
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.833
<i>Touchdown.</i>

1737
01:15:35.269 --> 01:15:37.315
Oh. Tom. come on.

1738
01:15:37.489 --> 01:15:39.578
<i>It'’s only halftime.</i>[Nat] <i>21 to 3.</i>

1739
01:15:39.752 --> 01:15:42.015
Somebody better be saying
something really inspiring

1740
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:43.539
in that locker room
- right now.
- I hope so.

1741
01:15:46.977 --> 01:15:49.588
<i>And we are underway
here in the third quarter.</i>

1742
01:15:49.762 --> 01:15:51.503
<i>It just takes one play.</i>[Nat] <i>Sure.</i>

1743
01:15:51.677 --> 01:15:53.549
It just takes one play.

1744
01:15:53.723 --> 01:15:55.681
One play and then
you got momentum
and then...

1745
01:15:57.901 --> 01:15:59.250
<i>To Coleman.</i>

1746
01:15:59.424 --> 01:16:01.165
<i>End zone touchdown.</i>

1747
01:16:01.339 --> 01:16:04.516
<i>28-3. This one
has been all Atlanta.</i>

1748
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:08.389
- Wow.
- That sucked.

1749
01:16:12.393 --> 01:16:15.222
28-3. What'’s happening?

1750
01:16:15.396 --> 01:16:18.182
Well. it'’s just
the third quarter.

1751
01:16:18.356 --> 01:16:20.053
They could still come back.

1752
01:16:20.227 --> 01:16:22.534
Well. I'’m sorry
for your loss. ladies.

1753
01:16:22.708 --> 01:16:24.188
Well. thank you.

1754
01:16:24.362 --> 01:16:25.972
but we have not lost yet.

1755
01:16:26.146 --> 01:16:27.147
No.

1756
01:16:28.192 --> 01:16:29.672
Do you know
what the Patriots'’ chances

1757
01:16:29.846 --> 01:16:31.238
of pulling this one out are?

1758
01:16:31.978 --> 01:16:33.545
- One percent?
- Close.

1759
01:16:33.719 --> 01:16:36.374
They have
a .7% chance of winning.

1760
01:16:36.548 --> 01:16:39.116
I still think
they can pull it out.

1761
01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:41.814
Oh. hon.
I wouldn'’t bet on it.

1762
01:16:47.298 --> 01:16:49.300
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
as a reminder.</i>

1763
01:16:49.474 --> 01:16:52.172
<i>we will have the official
Lombardi Trophy presentation</i>

1764
01:16:52.346 --> 01:16:54.653
<i>at the conclusion
of this game.</i>

1765
01:16:54.827 --> 01:16:57.961
Pardon my language.
but screw this.

1766
01:16:58.135 --> 01:16:59.397
Are you leaving?

1767
01:16:59.571 --> 01:17:01.399
I'’m gonna do something
about it.

1768
01:17:01.573 --> 01:17:03.009
You can stay here
if you want to.

1769
01:17:03.183 --> 01:17:05.795
but this is not
how my Super Bowl ends.

1770
01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:09.668
- Hey. hang on to this.
- We got a deal.

1771
01:17:11.278 --> 01:17:12.628
- What'’s up?
- Let'’s go. Let'’s go.

1772
01:17:12.802 --> 01:17:13.759
- What?
- Let'’s go. Come on.

1773
01:17:13.933 --> 01:17:14.934
Lou?

1774
01:17:22.507 --> 01:17:24.814
Five minutes to go
in the third quarter.

1775
01:17:24.988 --> 01:17:27.512
and we are down by...

1776
01:17:29.383 --> 01:17:31.647
- a lot. It'’s a lot.
- Yeah.

1777
01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:34.737
It is not looking good.
- Pats Nation.
- No.

1778
01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:40.873
We gotta find a way
to get the ball
in the end zone.

1779
01:17:41.047 --> 01:17:43.093
We got no choice but to stay
in our two-minute offense

1780
01:17:43.267 --> 01:17:45.269
for the rest of the game.
We got no time left.

1781
01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:47.053
Hey!

1782
01:17:49.621 --> 01:17:51.710
Let'’s go cover two.
Cover two. Yeah. Yeah.

1783
01:17:51.884 --> 01:17:53.451
Yeah. Double on Julio.
Watch the scene.

1784
01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:54.974
Over Matt too.

1785
01:17:55.148 --> 01:17:57.194
- Let'’s go. Cover two.
- No. no. Go to cover one.

1786
01:17:57.368 --> 01:17:58.630
- Go to cover one.
- What are you doing?

1787
01:17:58.804 --> 01:18:00.066
- You can'’t be in here.
- Listen to me now.

1788
01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.807
It frees McCourty
to play the run.

1789
01:18:01.981 --> 01:18:04.114
get some sort of
creative blitz going here.

1790
01:18:04.288 --> 01:18:06.507
You'’ve got great linebackers.
Use '’em. for God'’s sakes.

1791
01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:07.987
Why are we in cover one?

1792
01:18:08.161 --> 01:18:10.294
What? No. Cover two. What?

1793
01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:16.779
Yes![coach 2] Let'’s go!

1794
01:18:16.953 --> 01:18:19.564
- Tom?
- Hey. you can'’t touch that.
What--

1795
01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:21.958
You wanna get to her.
you gotta go through me.

1796
01:18:22.785 --> 01:18:24.047
Leave them. They can stay.

1797
01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:25.178
- What else you got?
- Okay.

1798
01:18:25.352 --> 01:18:27.441
Tom? Tom. can you hear me?

1799
01:18:27.615 --> 01:18:29.400
<i>Can you hear me. Tom?</i>

1800
01:18:30.314 --> 01:18:31.489
<i>Up here.</i>

1801
01:18:31.663 --> 01:18:34.144
<i>Tom. can you hear me?</i>

1802
01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:36.450
<i>Can you hear me. Tom?</i>

1803
01:18:36.624 --> 01:18:37.800
Up here. Up here.

1804
01:18:38.409 --> 01:18:39.410
Up here.

1805
01:18:40.367 --> 01:18:43.066
I'’m Louella.
I'’m your biggest fan.

1806
01:18:44.981 --> 01:18:47.374
I don'’t know if this is
the right time to talk.

1807
01:18:47.548 --> 01:18:52.292
Sixteen years ago.
I was in the middle of chemo.

1808
01:18:52.466 --> 01:18:55.513
feeling like I was done.
like I had nothing more in me.

1809
01:18:55.687 --> 01:18:57.515
And then you came on the TV.

1810
01:18:57.689 --> 01:19:00.692
fearless. determined.
a skinny little rookie.

1811
01:19:00.866 --> 01:19:02.999
Watching you play that season

1812
01:19:03.173 --> 01:19:05.566
gave me something extra
to look forward to.

1813
01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:08.178
Each week.
I found strength in that.

1814
01:19:08.352 --> 01:19:10.397
and that strength got me
through my treatments.

1815
01:19:10.571 --> 01:19:13.183
But that was 16 years ago.

1816
01:19:13.357 --> 01:19:14.924
and I'’ve enjoyed
every moment since.

1817
01:19:15.098 --> 01:19:17.970
And I'’m sure you enjoyed
winning all those Super Bowls.

1818
01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:22.105
But that was the past.
and we can'’t live in the past.

1819
01:19:22.279 --> 01:19:25.586
No matter how good
or how bad it was.

1820
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:29.112
Right now
we have this one moment.

1821
01:19:29.286 --> 01:19:31.679
and you'’re down
in this game. a lot.

1822
01:19:31.854 --> 01:19:33.899
But you'’re Tom Brady.

1823
01:19:34.073 --> 01:19:35.771
You have to come back.

1824
01:19:35.945 --> 01:19:37.294
That'’s what you do best.

1825
01:19:37.468 --> 01:19:39.513
And I love you
because you are the best.

1826
01:19:39.687 --> 01:19:42.778
And anyone who doesn'’t
love you respects you

1827
01:19:42.952 --> 01:19:45.171
because you fight
and you never give up.

1828
01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.481
So I'’m not giving up either.

1829
01:19:53.701 --> 01:19:55.529
I don'’t know
what'’s ahead for me.

1830
01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:58.619
but if you fight.
I'’ll fight.

1831
01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:07.672
Now go out there and win.

1832
01:20:09.892 --> 01:20:11.371
Let'’s go!

1833
01:20:15.332 --> 01:20:16.724
Let'’s fucking go!

1834
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:21.207
- How was that?
- That was...

1835
01:20:21.381 --> 01:20:23.209
Beautiful.

1836
01:20:23.383 --> 01:20:24.820
All yours.

1837
01:20:24.994 --> 01:20:26.430
Let'’s go. offense.
Offense is up. Let'’s go.

1838
01:20:26.604 --> 01:20:28.475
<i>Come on.
We got a Super Bowl to win.</i>

1839
01:20:44.143 --> 01:20:46.580
Hey! Hey.
there'’s nine minutes left
and they'’ve got momentum.

1840
01:20:46.754 --> 01:20:49.932
If they pull this off.
it'’ll be the greatest comeback
in NFL history.

1841
01:20:50.106 --> 01:20:51.107
Oh. my God.

1842
01:20:54.023 --> 01:20:55.372
Actually. in '’93.

1843
01:20:55.546 --> 01:20:57.591
the Bills came back
from a much larger deficit.

1844
01:20:57.765 --> 01:20:59.289
but who'’s talking statistics?

1845
01:20:59.463 --> 01:21:01.247
Betty. what are you doing?
Come on.

1846
01:21:04.076 --> 01:21:06.383
All right. That just
puts us two touchdowns

1847
01:21:06.557 --> 01:21:09.995
and two two-point
- conversions away.
- And two-- Yeah.

1848
01:21:10.169 --> 01:21:12.955
Yeah. exactly.
Two touchdowns and two--So that'’s doable.

1849
01:21:13.129 --> 01:21:14.347
That'’s all they gotta do.

1850
01:21:14.521 --> 01:21:16.088
- That'’s all they gotta do.
- Oh. my God.

1851
01:21:16.262 --> 01:21:18.003
We gotta play harder.

1852
01:21:18.177 --> 01:21:20.310
Gotta play tougher.
Harder. tougher everything.

1853
01:21:22.312 --> 01:21:24.880
<i>Ryan gets hit.
and that'’s a fumble.</i>

1854
01:21:25.054 --> 01:21:26.620
<i>New England recovers.</i>

1855
01:21:26.794 --> 01:21:28.622
<i>Something has really
gotten into the Patriots.</i>

1856
01:21:28.796 --> 01:21:30.276
We got the ball back.

1857
01:21:31.190 --> 01:21:33.323
This is too stressful.
Oh. God.

1858
01:21:35.064 --> 01:21:36.108
<i>Brady...</i>

1859
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:40.025
<i>connects with Amendola.
Touchdown Patriots.</i>

1860
01:21:40.634 --> 01:21:41.897
<i>28-18.</i>

1861
01:21:45.639 --> 01:21:47.554
- Amendola.
- Oh. my God.
That was nice.

1862
01:21:47.728 --> 01:21:50.296
He'’s got a skull
like a baby bird'’s.

1863
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:52.995
but his hands
are like Midas.

1864
01:21:53.169 --> 01:21:54.779
<i>Brady throws up two.</i>

1865
01:21:54.953 --> 01:21:56.912
<i>Two-point conversion.
here we go.</i>

1866
01:21:57.086 --> 01:21:59.653
<i>It'’s a direct snap
to James right through.
Right through.</i>

1867
01:21:59.827 --> 01:22:01.612
- He'’s in there!
- Oh. he'’s got it.

1868
01:22:01.786 --> 01:22:03.570
<i>Oh. my God.
Give Tom an Oscar for that.</i>

1869
01:22:03.744 --> 01:22:06.008
<i>I thought that was it.
Oh. my God.</i>

1870
01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:09.098
<i>20-28.</i>

1871
01:22:09.272 --> 01:22:10.969
<i>Someone must have said
something inspiring to Brady.</i>

1872
01:22:11.143 --> 01:22:12.753
<i>'’cause he is on fire.</i>

1873
01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:14.538
<i>It'’s a one-score game.</i>

1874
01:22:16.801 --> 01:22:18.194
<i>Matt up in the pocket.</i>

1875
01:22:18.368 --> 01:22:20.457
<i>Now gonna cut it loose.
looking for Julio.</i>

1876
01:22:20.631 --> 01:22:21.849
<i>What a catch!</i>

1877
01:22:22.024 --> 01:22:24.243
<i>He made a catch! Unbelievable!</i>

1878
01:22:27.551 --> 01:22:30.206
<i>Oh.
they just sacked Matty Ice.[Nat] Oh. my God.</i>

1879
01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:33.165
<i>Oh. my God.
He can'’t kick it from there.</i>

1880
01:22:33.339 --> 01:22:34.384
Attaboy. Flowers. Come on.

1881
01:22:34.558 --> 01:22:35.863
<i>Two and a half minutes left.</i>

1882
01:22:36.038 --> 01:22:37.865
<i>We gotta get
down the field here. kid.</i>

1883
01:22:42.609 --> 01:22:44.133
Oh. God. Oh. God.

1884
01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.398
I caught it. It'’s crazy.
I swear to God.

1885
01:22:48.572 --> 01:22:49.790
- No way. Look at that.
- Watch.

1886
01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:51.401
- Look there.
- Yo.

1887
01:22:51.575 --> 01:22:52.968
<i>Edelman comes down
with the football.</i>

1888
01:22:53.142 --> 01:22:54.317
<i>They'’re saying it'’s a catch.</i>

1889
01:22:54.491 --> 01:22:56.319
<i>It'’s a catch! It'’s a catch!</i>

1890
01:22:56.493 --> 01:22:58.190
<i>It'’s a catch!</i>[Pat] <i>That is
the greatest catch...</i>

1891
01:22:58.364 --> 01:23:00.410
Oh. my freaking Lord....in NFL history.

1892
01:23:00.584 --> 01:23:02.151
Off his leg.

1893
01:23:02.325 --> 01:23:03.848
After review.
the ruling on the field
is confirmed.

1894
01:23:11.029 --> 01:23:12.074
That'’s crazy.

1895
01:23:14.032 --> 01:23:15.468
<i>Passes it off to James White.</i>

1896
01:23:15.642 --> 01:23:17.644
<i>who runs it into the end zone.</i>

1897
01:23:17.818 --> 01:23:20.212
<i>And he'’s in there.
He'’s in there.</i>[Nat] <i>Oh. my God!</i>

1898
01:23:20.386 --> 01:23:22.388
<i>We'’re within two!
Two points away.</i>

1899
01:23:22.562 --> 01:23:24.434
Oh. my God. James White.
You beauty.

1900
01:23:26.305 --> 01:23:28.612
We need a two-point conversion.
We only have a minute left.

1901
01:23:28.786 --> 01:23:30.875
Miracles happen.
They happen every day.

1902
01:23:32.572 --> 01:23:35.184
<i>Quick screen to Amendola
and he'’s in.</i>

1903
01:23:37.882 --> 01:23:39.971
- It'’s tied! It'’s tied!
- He tied it! He tied it!

1904
01:23:40.145 --> 01:23:42.452
<i>The ball crossed the line.
He is in.</i>

1905
01:23:48.153 --> 01:23:49.241
Way to go.

1906
01:23:49.415 --> 01:23:50.329
Let'’s go!

1907
01:23:50.503 --> 01:23:53.593
Tom Brady!

1908
01:23:55.552 --> 01:23:57.771
Oh. my God.
Overtime for the first time

1909
01:23:57.945 --> 01:24:00.296
- in Super Bowl history.
- Oh. my God.

1910
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:03.777
- Holy sh-- Oh. my God.
- We are going to overtime.

1911
01:24:03.951 --> 01:24:06.345
Hey. would somebody get him
his blood pressure cuff?

1912
01:24:06.519 --> 01:24:07.999
Oh. my God.

1913
01:24:08.173 --> 01:24:10.610
It'’s not over. It'’s not over.
Stay focused.

1914
01:24:10.784 --> 01:24:12.743
Gentlemen. we'’re about to
begin an overtime period

1915
01:24:12.917 --> 01:24:15.006
that will continue
until a winner is determined.

1916
01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.616
It is sudden death.

1917
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:18.879
unless the first team
to possess kicks a field goal.

1918
01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:21.186
in which case the other team
will have an opportunity.

1919
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.146
This is heads.
This is tails.

1920
01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.451
New England gets to
call the toss.

1921
01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:27.323
- Heads.
- They have called heads.

1922
01:24:29.934 --> 01:24:32.067
- It is heads.
- We'’ll take the ball.

1923
01:24:32.241 --> 01:24:33.807
- Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

1924
01:24:33.981 --> 01:24:36.419
- Okay. okay. okay.
- Okay. Hear me.

1925
01:24:36.593 --> 01:24:38.247
- Okay. okay.
- Okay. okay. okay.

1926
01:24:39.683 --> 01:24:42.381
Let'’s go score
- and win this thing. baby.
- Yeah. Here we go.

1927
01:24:53.175 --> 01:24:54.480
<i>Amendola with the catch.</i>

1928
01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:06.666
<i>Tom Brady to Hogan.</i>

1929
01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.625
<i>For 16 yards.</i> Let'’s go. Hoge!

1930
01:25:09.756 --> 01:25:12.194
<i>Oh! Oh!
A few more for good measure.</i>

1931
01:25:12.368 --> 01:25:15.022
I think I'’m gonna throw up.
and this is the best
experience of my life.

1932
01:25:20.767 --> 01:25:22.639
<i>Pass to Edelman.
Fifteen yards. Here we go.</i>

1933
01:25:22.813 --> 01:25:24.554
<i>Nice.</i>[Pat] <i>This is it.
piece by piece.</i>

1934
01:25:24.728 --> 01:25:25.685
<i>We'’re marching.</i>

1935
01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:29.646
<i>Here'’s Bennett.</i>

1936
01:25:32.083 --> 01:25:33.780
<i>Couldn'’t hold onto it.</i>

1937
01:25:39.308 --> 01:25:41.353
Come on. Tom. You'’ve got this.

1938
01:25:45.749 --> 01:25:47.229
Green 19!

1939
01:26:04.681 --> 01:26:06.639
[announcer] <i>He'’s in!</i>

1940
01:26:06.813 --> 01:26:09.381
<i>Patriots win the Super Bowl.</i>

1941
01:26:17.084 --> 01:26:20.610
<i>The Pats win
the Super Bowl.</i>[chuckles]

1942
01:26:20.784 --> 01:26:22.351
I cannot be-- Come here.

1943
01:26:25.354 --> 01:26:26.703
- Oh. my God.
- I love you. kid.

1944
01:26:26.877 --> 01:26:28.052
They did it!

1945
01:26:29.314 --> 01:26:30.228
You did it.

1946
01:26:30.402 --> 01:26:32.056
No. we did it.

1947
01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:34.841
We did it. We did it.

1948
01:27:23.194 --> 01:27:25.327
Oh. it was worth every penny.

1949
01:27:27.938 --> 01:27:31.463
Lou. how much
did you spend on this?

1950
01:27:31.637 --> 01:27:33.073
Mmm. A lot.

1951
01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:36.120
I might be able
to help with that.

1952
01:27:36.294 --> 01:27:37.774
What do you mean?

1953
01:27:37.948 --> 01:27:40.167
In the third quarter.
I made a bet with that rich guy

1954
01:27:40.342 --> 01:27:42.431
that the Pats would
come back and win.

1955
01:27:43.083 --> 01:27:44.389
How much did you win?

1956
01:27:44.563 --> 01:27:46.261
A lot.

1957
01:27:46.435 --> 01:27:49.699
But he didn'’t have
enough cash on him.
so the poor guy--

1958
01:27:50.308 --> 01:27:51.527
I just had to. uh...

1959
01:27:52.484 --> 01:27:53.442
take this.

1960
01:27:54.399 --> 01:27:56.749
Oh. my God.

1961
01:27:56.923 --> 01:27:59.709
So you'’re the women
that broke into
the coaches'’ booth.

1962
01:27:59.883 --> 01:28:01.276
I did. I'’m the one.

1963
01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:02.973
I should'’ve known.

1964
01:28:03.147 --> 01:28:05.192
Come with me.
All of you.

1965
01:28:05.367 --> 01:28:07.847
- No. no. Don'’t take them.
- You'’re not going alone.

1966
01:28:08.979 --> 01:28:10.546
You sure walk slow.

1967
01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:12.983
Yeah. Walking with authority.

1968
01:28:14.114 --> 01:28:16.595
I'’m sorry. I know
we shouldn'’t have done it.

1969
01:28:16.769 --> 01:28:18.293
But someone
had to do something.

1970
01:28:18.467 --> 01:28:20.643
They were gonna lose.

1971
01:28:20.817 --> 01:28:23.036
I can'’t believe
- we'’re doing this.
- What'’s gonna happen to us?

1972
01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:26.213
Oh. God.[Lou] I haven'’t been to jail
since '’67.

1973
01:28:26.388 --> 01:28:27.389
Hey!

1974
01:28:41.359 --> 01:28:42.404
Oh. my God.

1975
01:28:42.926 --> 01:28:44.231
Oh. my God.

1976
01:28:44.406 --> 01:28:47.191
Oh. my God.
You'’re Danny Amendola.

1977
01:28:47.365 --> 01:28:48.453
- Yeah.
- Danny Amendola.

1978
01:28:48.627 --> 01:28:49.933
you have
the highest catch percentage

1979
01:28:50.107 --> 01:28:51.108
of anyone out there.

1980
01:28:51.282 --> 01:28:53.023
You are reliable.

1981
01:28:53.197 --> 01:28:55.373
Oh. that'’s the nicest thing
anybody'’s ever said to me.

1982
01:28:55.547 --> 01:28:57.767
What do you mean?
I'’m sure they say that
to you all the time.

1983
01:28:57.941 --> 01:29:00.204
- Is this yours?
- Oh. yeah. I'’m sorry.
It'’s sweaty.

1984
01:29:00.378 --> 01:29:02.685
Oh. yes. it'’s very sweaty.
And does your head actually...

1985
01:29:02.859 --> 01:29:04.469
I wanna shave you.

1986
01:29:05.949 --> 01:29:06.993
Yeah.

1987
01:29:21.007 --> 01:29:23.096
- Gronk.
- Hi.

1988
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:24.489
Have you--
Have you read this book?

1989
01:29:24.663 --> 01:29:27.057
I take it everywhere I go.

1990
01:29:27.231 --> 01:29:29.015
You'’re so big.

1991
01:29:30.016 --> 01:29:31.061
Thank you.

1992
01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:33.368
Louella?

1993
01:29:34.543 --> 01:29:35.587
Tom.

1994
01:29:36.762 --> 01:29:38.938
I wanna thank you
for what you did out there.

1995
01:29:40.113 --> 01:29:41.027
Thank you so much.

1996
01:29:41.201 --> 01:29:43.073
I should say
the same to you.

1997
01:29:44.988 --> 01:29:46.642
Oh. what a day.

1998
01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:50.036
- Can you believe it?
- No.

1999
01:29:59.698 --> 01:30:01.265
Thanks for saying all that.

2000
01:30:05.138 --> 01:30:06.226
I don'’t know how you did it.

2001
01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:09.578
but your words
meant the world to me.

2002
01:30:11.101 --> 01:30:12.407
We were down.

2003
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:15.584
You knew just what I needed.

2004
01:30:17.499 --> 01:30:19.457
You know.
I play a game that I love.

2005
01:30:20.371 --> 01:30:21.590
this game of football.

2006
01:30:21.764 --> 01:30:23.983
and it'’s taught me so much.

2007
01:30:24.157 --> 01:30:28.814
And people say all the time.
"You inspire me." and...

2008
01:30:30.816 --> 01:30:32.209
it'’s just a game.

2009
01:30:33.602 --> 01:30:36.213
What you'’ve been through.
how tough you are.

2010
01:30:37.083 --> 01:30:38.650
you inspire me.

2011
01:30:38.824 --> 01:30:41.261
And your courage
inspires me.

2012
01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:42.480
so thank you.

2013
01:30:46.702 --> 01:30:47.746
You'’re welcome.

2014
01:30:49.748 --> 01:30:51.358
And I love that jersey.

2015
01:30:53.230 --> 01:30:54.274
Wow.

2016
01:30:55.014 --> 01:30:56.494
Could we do a jersey swap?

2017
01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.193
- This jersey for your jersey?
- Yeah.

2018
01:31:00.367 --> 01:31:03.980
And it'’s all sweaty
- and everything?
- It'’s got a lot of sweat on it.

2019
01:31:04.154 --> 01:31:06.330
- All right. I can do it.
- Yes.

2020
01:31:06.504 --> 01:31:09.202
That one is--
I'’ve never had anything
with the sequins like that.

2021
01:31:10.421 --> 01:31:12.379
Where is my jersey?

2022
01:31:12.554 --> 01:31:13.816
It was just right here.

2023
01:31:14.991 --> 01:31:17.515
Well. you know.
you can send it to me.

2024
01:31:18.124 --> 01:31:18.951
I will.

2025
01:31:20.083 --> 01:31:21.127
Of course.

01:31:37.622 --> 01:31:40.799
<i>that hasn'’t even been
to the post-season since 2007.</i>

2030
01:31:40.973 --> 01:31:42.540
<i>At this point.</i>

2031
01:31:42.714 --> 01:31:44.150
<i>I'’ve learned to never doubt
what Brady is capable of.</i>

2032
01:31:44.324 --> 01:31:45.891
<i>but you have to imagine...</i> Game'’s about to start.

2033
01:31:46.065 --> 01:31:47.153
Hey. guys.

2034
01:31:47.327 --> 01:31:48.807
Come on.
The game is about to start.

2035
01:31:48.981 --> 01:31:50.243
- Okay.
- How'’s the guacamole?

2036
01:31:50.417 --> 01:31:51.636
- It'’s done.
- Let'’s see.

2037
01:31:51.810 --> 01:31:53.464
- No. More onion.
- Come on.

2038
01:31:53.638 --> 01:31:55.727
- More onion? Of course.
- I think
you'’re doing just fine.

2039
01:31:55.901 --> 01:31:58.077
Well. she'’s a woman
who knows what she wants.

2040
01:31:58.251 --> 01:32:00.427
Let'’s go.
- It'’s about to begin.
- We'’re coming. We'’re coming.

2041
01:32:00.602 --> 01:32:01.907
Hurry.

2042
01:32:02.081 --> 01:32:04.127
Before anyone else does.
I wanna make a toast.

2043
01:32:05.302 --> 01:32:06.869
To a new season.

2044
01:32:07.043 --> 01:32:08.871
a new team.

2045
01:32:09.045 --> 01:32:11.221
and to the woman
who brought us all together.

2046
01:32:12.265 --> 01:32:13.919
Wait a minute.
where the heck is she?

2047
01:32:14.964 --> 01:32:15.834
Mom. come on!

2048
01:32:16.008 --> 01:32:17.662
We'’re all ready!

2049
01:32:17.836 --> 01:32:20.709
I was in the garage.
getting chips.

2050
01:32:20.883 --> 01:32:25.061
- To our healthy quarterback.
- Oh.

2051
01:32:25.235 --> 01:32:27.063
<i>All set here at Tampa Bay.</i> Kickoff. Hurry up.

2052
01:32:27.237 --> 01:32:30.719
<i>There'’s the whistle.
This is the kickoff.
and we are underway.</i>

2053
01:32:52.871 --> 01:32:54.612
So when are you gonna retire?

2054
01:32:54.786 --> 01:32:57.180
I don'’t like to
use the word "retire."
It sounds so final.

2055
01:32:58.485 --> 01:33:02.228
I don'’t "retire."
I just change careers.

2056
01:33:02.402 --> 01:33:03.882
Often.

2057
01:33:04.056 --> 01:33:05.884
Technically.
I took a sabbatical
many years ago.

2058
01:33:06.058 --> 01:33:07.930
and I just never returned
to work.

2059
01:33:08.104 --> 01:33:12.238
I wasn'’t asking you girls.
I was asking him.

2060
01:33:12.412 --> 01:33:15.154
You know. I'’ve thought a lot
about retirement.

2061
01:33:15.328 --> 01:33:19.419
But it'’d be a shame
to retire if you feel
like you still got it.

2062
01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:20.899
Join the club.

2063
01:33:21.073 --> 01:33:22.509
- Yeah. I'’ll drink to that.
- Hear! Hear!

2064
01:33:22.684 --> 01:33:24.337
- Me too.
- Look at this spot.

2065
01:33:25.208 --> 01:33:27.253
- Cheers.
- Tampa. Who knew?
