3
00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:15.326
This is PAW Patrol.
Mission accomplished. Over.

4
00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.246
This is Baby Shark. Perfect.
Initializing wake up plan.

5
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.706
Cover your ears. okay?

6
00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:24.168
Okay. Always together. Over.

7
00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:27.797
Three.

8
00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.216
Two.

9
00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:32.426
One.

10
00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.027
What? What?

11
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.821
It's the end of the world!

12
00:01:51.904 --> 00:01:54.323
Javier. take the girls to the bunker.

13
00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:55.533
What bunker?

14
00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:58.494
What bunker? The house's bunker!

15
00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:02.540
The house doesn't have a bunker!
I bought a house without one!

16
00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:04.083
Why do you never listen?

17
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:07.294
How will we protect ourselves?

18
00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:15.302
We're not being attacked. idiot.
It's Luna's fireworks.

19
00:02:15.386 --> 00:02:18.514
-Are you sure?
-Yes. I'm sure.

20
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.060
-No!
-I knew it!

21
00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.479
-I found you!
-No!

22
00:02:25.563 --> 00:02:27.731
-Come here! Confess!
-No!

23
00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:29.692
Was it yours or Luna's idea?

24
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:33.070
-Whose idea was it?
-I'll never tell. I'm a good soldier!

25
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.531
-We'll see!
-Sister. come rescue me!

26
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.785
I'll save you. sister! Yes!

27
00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:52.047
-What are you laughing at?
-Your face.

28
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:53.215
Did you see yours?

29
00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.472
Girls. you're grounded.

30
00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:02.725
Where are you going?

31
00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:07.104
-Get ready. we're late for school!
-Listen to your dad!

32
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:09.398
Luna. get dressed now!

33
00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:13.527
TWICE AS PREGNANT 2

34
00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:02.326
Girls!

35
00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:07.456
Hurry. If we're late again.
I'll have to talk to Miss Paty.

36
00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:08.624
and she scares me.

37
00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:10.542
Don't run.

38
00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:22.304
-Ready?
-Yes.

39
00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:26.642
Why are you crying? We do this every day.

40
00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.560
I get emotional to see you go.

41
00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:45.786
Come on. asshole! My buddy.

42
00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.205
Go on. my buddy.

43
00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:52.501
Sol. be careful. I got the seats cleaned.

44
00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:56.422
-Dad. can I rehearse my song?
-Yes. baby.

45
00:04:57.214 --> 00:05:00.342
-But quietly. I have a headache.
-Yes. thank you. Dad.

46
00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:39.798
Okay. we're here. Bye.

47
00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:44.511
Be good. No. the seats. baby.

48
00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.681
-One. two.
-Don't slam the door!

49
00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.349
Javier.

50
00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.644
-How are you?
-Miss Pau. Good.

51
00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:54.521
Am I that ugly?

52
00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:56.398
No. I got scared because--

53
00:05:56.482 --> 00:05:58.650
Relax. Javier. I'm joking.

54
00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:03.197
You seem tight. You're very tense.

55
00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.242
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

56
00:06:07.326 --> 00:06:08.786
-That's tension.
-Yes.

57
00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:10.996
Look like someone needs to have fun.

58
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.708
To relax. To go on a date
with someone tonight.

59
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:19.379
Miss Pau. I'd love that.
but unfortunately. I can't date you.

60
00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:22.174
Why not? I always ask you out and you--

61
00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:26.011
Yes. it's just that
there's a rule you don't know.

62
00:06:26.095 --> 00:06:27.179
What rule?

63
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:33.143
Felipe and I promised the girls
we wouldn't date until they were 18.

64
00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:35.395
-Are you kidding?
-No.

65
00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:39.483
Javier. my 10-year-olds have
more intelligent rules.

66
00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:41.610
You two are pathetic.

67
00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:55.541
So pretty.

68
00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.589
-How am I doing?
-Amazing.

69
00:07:03.132 --> 00:07:06.593
I love how much energy and time
you're taking for it.

70
00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.512
-Right?
-But you know what?

71
00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.474
The most important thing is missing.

72
00:07:12.558 --> 00:07:13.934
What would that be?

73
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.230
Stop painting. dear artists.

74
00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:20.732
I want you to know that

75
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.069
each stroke of yours
represents so much love.

76
00:07:24.153 --> 00:07:25.362
but I feel...

77
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.491
we're not breaking
the limits of the literal world.

78
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.786
And I want to feel it.
I want to feel that love

79
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.872
because we're painting our family.

80
00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:38.375
The people who love us most.
who puts up with us.

81
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.878
who bears with us. who are there for us.

82
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:44.923
So I want you to show that in each stroke.

83
00:07:45.007 --> 00:07:46.175
As you know.

84
00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:51.805
I became an orphan due to an accident
and that's why I can't have kids.

85
00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:55.893
But that doesn't mean
that I don't know what a family is.

86
00:07:57.269 --> 00:07:58.937
I want you to show me that.

87
00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:01.857
I want to see love.

88
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.445
I want you to show me with passion
what it means to have a family.

89
00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:08.697
I want to feel it.

90
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.534
I want laughter.
When a mom takes care of you.

91
00:08:12.618 --> 00:08:14.203
A hot chocolate.

92
00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:16.163
All the love I didn't have.

93
00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.916
that life took from me.
but I know I can have.

94
00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:22.044
With passion. with love. with heart.

95
00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:25.088
This is what I want.

96
00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:32.429
Da Vinci.

97
00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:38.227
Good morning.

98
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.647
Good morning.

99
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.357
Paperwork at three o'clock.

100
00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.169
"Guess what?

101
00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:09.216
"We're a week away from
our 11th anniversary of meeting.

102
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.301
"Since it's a special date.

103
00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:13.720
"I'd like to take
a trip with our family.

104
00:09:13.804 --> 00:09:16.932
"We deserve to celebrate
11 years of being together.

105
00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:20.352
"I ask that you choose
between these two destinations.

106
00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:22.104
"Love. Felipe."

107
00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:27.859
Boss.

108
00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:35.033
I love how thoughtful Felipe is with you.

109
00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:37.411
You're such a cute couple.

110
00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:39.329
I wish my man was like this.

111
00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:42.082
How many times have
I said we're not a couple?

112
00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.959
We live together for the kids.

113
00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:46.420
But you share a bed. I bought it myself.

114
00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:49.047
Yes. but just because Luna burned mine.

115
00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:52.509
We sleep each on one side.
We have a pillow in the middle.

116
00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.053
Javi. the bed burned two years ago.

117
00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:57.681
What do you need. FabiÃ¡n?

118
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:03.103
We need the new project's approved budgets
and the accountant's not answering.

119
00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.355
I sent her 10 emails. and nothing.

120
00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:07.774
Go see her. Her office is 100 meters away.

121
00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:10.777
She scares me. She's intense.

122
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:14.406
She beat up a delivery man once
for forgetting her salsa.

123
00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:15.907
Yes. she's like that.

124
00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:21.204
I'll go take care of it.
You take care of the rest.

125
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.504
Legal needs the...

126
00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:33.383
What is this? Why aren't you working?

127
00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:34.885
I'm taking a break.

128
00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.095
That's how you take it?

129
00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:41.725
Relax. No one dares to come in here.

130
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:43.852
That's not the point.

131
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:46.271
So. what's the point?

132
00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:49.191
You can't be like that.

133
00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:51.109
Like what?

134
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.112
Lying like that.

135
00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.367
Be thankful
I don't take my clothes off for it.

136
00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.911
You know I love being naked.

137
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.622
You can't take breaks whenever you want.

138
00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:06.541
They are scheduled.
You have to follow the rules.

139
00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:10.712
-Because... No. because--
-What? Are you gonna punish me. boss?

140
00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.131
-Yes. I could--
-Tell me. boss.

141
00:11:13.215 --> 00:11:15.217
What will you do to punish me?

142
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.553
I can do many things.
I can lower your salary.

143
00:11:18.637 --> 00:11:20.847
I can suspend you. I can--

144
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:23.725
I can... I can...
I'll figure something out.

145
00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.437
I know a way you can punish me.

146
00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:32.275
No. I didn't come for this.

147
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:35.028
I came for paperwork.
This isn't professional.

148
00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:37.197
Shut up and kiss me.

149
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.783
You promised me a romantic getaway.

150
00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:42.369
but your kids always come up.
and we can't.

151
00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:46.081
Can you give me 10 minutes?

152
00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:47.833
Yes. I can.

153
00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:57.008
Class. thanks for your talent.
That's pure love!

154
00:11:57.426 --> 00:11:58.468
I love it!

155
00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:02.639
-I'm so happy!
-Cami. I have a present.

156
00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:05.058
Are they sugar free?

157
00:12:05.142 --> 00:12:07.561
And lactose free to not upset your tummy.

158
00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:13.733
-Bye!
-Take care!

159
00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:14.860
Bye!

160
00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.487
You are what any woman
could ask for from...

161
00:12:18.155 --> 00:12:20.073
-The universe.
-Hey.

162
00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:22.367
-Thanks.
-Did you like my painting?

163
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:24.870
-I loved it.
-Did I put too much yellow?

164
00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:31.293
That lurid yellow? No. it makes it unique.

165
00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:34.296
Right? I hope that
when you meet my family.

166
00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:36.256
you don't find it too lurid.

167
00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.968
-No. Come to dinner at my house tonight.
-Tonight?

168
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:42.846
Why that face?
Is it too soon? Did I go too far?

169
00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:44.764
I think it's the next step.

170
00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:46.600
Of course. it is.

171
00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:49.853
I just didn't know
you wanted to meet them now.

172
00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.189
I don't just want to meet them.

173
00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.774
I'd like to...

174
00:12:56.276 --> 00:13:01.990
Well. be part of your family.
What do you say?

175
00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.700
-Great plan.
-Yes.

176
00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.285
It's great. the thing is...

177
00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:08.330
-Dinner. dinner. dinner!
-Wait.

178
00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:09.873
Dinner. dinner!

179
00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.041
Hello?

180
00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.502
Hi. we're calling from school.

181
00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:14.669
What?

182
00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:17.964
-I'm coming.
-Is everything okay?

183
00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:21.510
My daughters hit a friend at school.

184
00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:24.721
But they're not like that.

185
00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.015
-Fight. fight!
-Record this.

186
00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.434
Fight. fight!

187
00:13:29.518 --> 00:13:34.314
Fight. fight. fight. fight!

188
00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:36.900
Fight. fight!

189
00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.573
What's going to happen?

190
00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:49.496
Unfortunately. Javier. this institution
has zero tolerance with violence.

191
00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:52.332
Your daughters
will be suspended for two weeks.

192
00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:56.086
Two weeks? Isn't that too much?
It wasn't a big deal.

193
00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:59.214
Miss. what was the context of this?

194
00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.424
In class. Javier.

195
00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:03.802
We just finished a Biology test.

196
00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:07.931
and I told kids to think of ideas
for Mother's Day in two weeks.

197
00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:11.560
And my kids started hitting a schoolmate?
It makes no sense.

198
00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:13.144
My kids aren't violent.

199
00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:16.398
Well. Luna is. But Sol isn't.

200
00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:19.359
They must have been provoked.

201
00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:20.944
That's where I was going.

202
00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:24.322
He said something.
but I didn't want to say on the phone.

203
00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:25.365
What did he say?

204
00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.539
He said it was good
they didn't have a mom.

205
00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:35.584
they wouldn't have to do
anything for Mother's Day.

206
00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:41.339
Are we grounded?

207
00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:43.883
Of course you are.

208
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.261
It wasn't our fault.

209
00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.263
I don't care whose fault it was.

210
00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:53.184
You're our daughters.
and you can't go hitting people.

211
00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:56.771
Like you? You said
when you met Dad. you hit him.

212
00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.025
And he threw you out.

213
00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:01.234
Yes.

214
00:15:01.318 --> 00:15:02.902
No. it wasn't like that.

215
00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:05.322
I stepped on something and fell.

216
00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:10.201
But I was very fit at that time.
I was agile.

217
00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:14.539
That's not the point. The point is
we were adults having a discussion.

218
00:15:14.623 --> 00:15:15.832
And you're kids.

219
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:18.918
So. when we grow up.

220
00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:21.338
-we can get into fights.
-All right.

221
00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:25.050
-No. you can't! See?
-Girls. what Daddy means is

222
00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:26.885
you have to talk it out.

223
00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:28.511
-Exactly.
-Not by fighting.

224
00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:32.932
Go to your room. I need to talk to Dad.

225
00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:34.684
We'll talk punishment later.

226
00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:36.311
-No.
-Yes.

227
00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:37.437
We will.

228
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.107
To your room. and don't make
that cute Shrek kitten's face.

229
00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:42.776
Come on. to your room.

230
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.446
-To the nursery!
-Okay!

231
00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:47.781
Don't run!

232
00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:49.824
-Be careful.
-They don't care.

233
00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:51.076
I'll beat you!

234
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.456
I'm watching you.

235
00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:00.710
We have to talk about the thing.

236
00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:06.466
About what. man?

237
00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.427
The girls need a mom.

238
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.307
What? It was just a school fight.
It's not a big deal.

239
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:16.768
Why do you think they reacted that way?

240
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.603
They didn't like the comment.

241
00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:20.522
Didn't like it? They were hurt.

242
00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:24.067
That's because
they're feeling something inside. I know.

243
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:27.612
I didn't think that.

244
00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:31.074
Well. we knew this would happen.

245
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.285
-We have to do something.
-What?

246
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.499
We have to call her.
She'll know what to do.

247
00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:49.509
Can you see me?

248
00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:50.593
-Cata!
-Cata!

249
00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:53.304
How are you. my babies?

250
00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:54.973
Well. bad.

251
00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:58.560
-We have a problem.
-What happened?

252
00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:01.646
We need to find a mom for our kids.

253
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.440
We don't know where to start.

254
00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:06.735
Do you know
if there's an app or something?

255
00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.778
Mom App? We should look.

256
00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:11.406
Why do you want a mom?

257
00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:14.993
Clearly. our daughters
suffer for not having one.

258
00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:18.329
My babies. no! No!

259
00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:21.166
-Cata?
-You-- Need--

260
00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.208
Cata?

261
00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:24.335
We can't hear you. Cata.

262
00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:26.087
They have--

263
00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:29.883
-Cata.
-You know her--

264
00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.509
-Catalina.
-It was cut-off.

265
00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:40.769
What did she mean?
That we know who the mom is?

266
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.064
I don't know.

267
00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.444
Do you?

268
00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.404
No. that's why I'm asking.

269
00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:56.159
You met someone. right?

270
00:17:57.452 --> 00:18:00.163
Okay. what does
meeting someone really mean?

271
00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:06.211
You damn. dirty. filthy rat! I knew it!
I knew you wouldn't endure it.

272
00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:10.089
I knew whenever you could.
you would date an old woman.

273
00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:13.885
and cheat on me and your kids.
and break our deal!

274
00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.595
What about you?

275
00:18:15.678 --> 00:18:18.598
You think I can't smell
that cheap perfume?

276
00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:20.225
Stop smelling my clothes!

277
00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:22.644
I iron them. I have to smell them!

278
00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:25.730
I want them to smell good.

279
00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:29.067
May I know who this new girlfriend is?

280
00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:33.238
It better not be
a fucking pot smoking hippie like you!

281
00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:36.407
She's not a hippie.
Her name is Camila de la Fuente.

282
00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:41.538
She's an art professor.
She has a master's in Sensory Arts.

283
00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:44.624
She loves nature. animals.

284
00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:48.336
sports. and most importantly.
she's dying to meet the kids.

285
00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:54.509
-And yours?
-My girlfriend is Antonia SÃ¡nchez.

286
00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:57.637
She's head of the Finance department
at my company.

287
00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:01.266
She loves literature.
and a healthy lifestyle.

288
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:06.229
She wants to meet them too.
She always asks when she'll meet them.

289
00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:07.272
Always.

290
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:14.112
Wow. so both of them
could be perfect moms.

291
00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:17.699
So? We don't need two moms.

292
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:21.286
That's what Cata meant.

293
00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:26.708
We have to choose a mom between them.

294
00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:28.251
What are you thinking?

295
00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:31.254
Maternity Hunger Games
to see who's the best mom?

296
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.006
Exactly.

297
00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:36.134
-I was joking. you moron!
-No. that's great.

298
00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:39.888
We volunteer each girlfriend as tribute.

299
00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:43.516
And the first one
to win the girls over. wins.

300
00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:45.560
Are you insane?

301
00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:48.229
If they realize we're making them compete.
they'll kill us.

302
00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:49.772
Especially mine. you don't know her.

303
00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:51.357
No one will know.

304
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.985
We won't say a word.

305
00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:55.194
It's perfect.

306
00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:58.781
No. this is wrong.

307
00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:02.035
Javier. don't think about you or me.

308
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.831
Think of the girls.

309
00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.337
I don't want them to suffer
for not having a mom.

310
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.047
We have to do something!

311
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.382
I can't believe I'll say this. but...

312
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.344
Where would they compete?

313
00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:33.274
-Is everything okay?
-I thought I'd meet them today.

314
00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:35.193
Too bad they got sick.

315
00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:40.990
Don't worry. you'll meet them soon.
I wanted to talk about that.

316
00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:41.991
When?

317
00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.160
Very soon.

318
00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:46.704
You always do that.

319
00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:49.958
You get my hopes up.
and I never meet them.

320
00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:53.461
"Baby. you'll meet them soon."
And I never do.

321
00:20:53.544 --> 00:20:55.838
Baby. I have to tell you something.

322
00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:02.220
Would you...

323
00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.222
What?

324
00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:06.808
Go on a trip with my family?

325
00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:09.936
-Really?
-Yes.

326
00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:10.979
-Yes.
-Yes?

327
00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:12.605
Yes. yes. I do.

328
00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:14.315
Yes. yes!

329
00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:15.650
Careful with my back!

330
00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.194
Can you stop

331
00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.823
throwing things at me? Let's talk!

332
00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:24.242
I'll never talk to you. you liar!

333
00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:25.910
Technically. I never lied.

334
00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:29.163
We're going on a getaway. right?

335
00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:31.708
Yes. but not as a family. it was just us!

336
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:34.877
What's wrong?
My kids are dying to meet you!

337
00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:38.089
You told them about me?

338
00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:41.718
No. Well. yes. a little.

339
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:43.970
Why would you ruin everything?

340
00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:46.389
Wait. Ruin what?

341
00:21:47.348 --> 00:21:51.519
Yes. I didn't want to meet your family.
Let alone your daughters.

342
00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:55.356
We've been together for a year.
This is next.

343
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.443
Javier. I love what we have.

344
00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:01.112
No commitments. no strings. no families.

345
00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:07.118
Rules were clear. and you accepted them.
Why did you have to ruin everything!

346
00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:11.456
Not Javi! Baby!

347
00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.916
Javi! It'll work in a minute. right?

348
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.002
I don't know. Poor Javi.

349
00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.629
Poor baby. I'm sorry. I overreacted.

350
00:22:19.714 --> 00:22:20.548
No.

351
00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:24.093
They're the best thing in my life.

352
00:22:25.178 --> 00:22:27.346
Please. just meet them.

353
00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:31.267
Do it for me. and for little Javi.

354
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.686
Whatever you and little Javi want.

355
00:22:34.228 --> 00:22:36.689
-But on one condition.
-Whatever you want.

356
00:22:36.773 --> 00:22:39.400
I'll have fun with you.
not be anyone's mom.

357
00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:42.487
-You won't be anyone's mom.
-No.

358
00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:47.742
-So. where are we going?
-Acapulco.

359
00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:54.082
Baby. Baby.

360
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:56.876
Baby. Javier.

361
00:22:57.877 --> 00:22:58.920
Javi.

362
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.895
Girls. don't ask any
uncomfortable questions to our guests.

363
00:23:17.188 --> 00:23:19.690
Why don't you call them your girlfriends?

364
00:23:19.774 --> 00:23:21.025
How do you know that?

365
00:23:21.109 --> 00:23:24.070
Dad. we're kids. but we're not stupid.

366
00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:27.824
Besides. you should have seen your faces
talking about them.

367
00:23:27.907 --> 00:23:32.411
Okay. then. No fireworks. no bombs.

368
00:23:35.456 --> 00:23:37.708
-I promise.
-Me too.

369
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.548
Javier! We're late!

370
00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:46.801
I'm coming! I went to the bathroom.

371
00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:50.596
In 20 kilometers. you'll all want to go.

372
00:23:57.728 --> 00:23:59.647
-What?
-What happened to you?

373
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:00.815
About what?

374
00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:05.444
You laugh. but skin cancer is a thing.

375
00:24:05.528 --> 00:24:08.614
It's very dangerous.
Don't laugh. you're next.

376
00:24:09.866 --> 00:24:11.284
Ready for the trip?

377
00:24:14.537 --> 00:24:15.413
Let go of me!

378
00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:17.665
Let's go.

379
00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:22.003
-Dad. can I go to the bathroom?
-What did I say?

380
00:24:22.086 --> 00:24:23.588
What did I say?

381
00:24:30.011 --> 00:24:31.012
Hi!

382
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.347
Wow. she looks like a princess.

383
00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:36.350
I'll help you. baby. Wait.

384
00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:45.359
Hi! You have no idea
how much I wanted to meet you.

385
00:24:46.611 --> 00:24:49.363
Just know you can
count on me for anything.

386
00:24:49.447 --> 00:24:51.699
Don't be afraid to ask for anything.

387
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:56.204
If I want gunpowder and matches.
will you buy me some?

388
00:24:56.787 --> 00:25:00.666
-Luna. stop thinking about burning things.
-Okay. sorry.

389
00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:06.422
Let's go. We're picking up someone else.

390
00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:08.299
Who?

391
00:25:09.383 --> 00:25:10.301
My girlfriend.

392
00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:18.100
Go!

393
00:25:31.113 --> 00:25:31.989
Where?

394
00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:06.482
Dad. is that your girlfriend?

395
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:09.360
Yes. give her time. She's special.

396
00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.154
Give me a kiss.

397
00:26:21.372 --> 00:26:22.957
Hi. my name is Sol.

398
00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:24.375
Hi. Sol.

399
00:26:24.458 --> 00:26:27.753
Nice to meet you.
Do you want to add a song for the trip?

400
00:26:28.212 --> 00:26:32.633
Yes. it's called
Don't bother me. I have to sleep.

401
00:26:32.717 --> 00:26:34.218
Okay. thank you.

402
00:26:36.012 --> 00:26:37.763
I can't find it.

403
00:26:37.847 --> 00:26:39.390
It doesn't exist.

404
00:27:45.206 --> 00:27:46.415
We're here!

405
00:27:53.089 --> 00:27:55.216
Wow. what a beautiful hotel. Dad.

406
00:27:55.674 --> 00:27:57.760
Wow. it's amazing.

407
00:27:57.843 --> 00:28:00.679
It's awesome. right? Girls. be careful.

408
00:28:00.763 --> 00:28:03.849
-I've never stayed at a hotel like this.
-I told you.

409
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.105
-Hello.
-Good afternoon.

410
00:28:09.522 --> 00:28:12.608
Welcome to Resort ParaÃ­so.
the best place to rest.

411
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:15.528
-do you have a reservation?
-Felipe Dumas.

412
00:28:15.611 --> 00:28:19.073
Perfect. Okay.
Three double bedrooms. right?

413
00:28:19.156 --> 00:28:21.075
I guess we're sleeping together.

414
00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:27.081
Sorry. we thought it'd be a good idea
that you shared a room.

415
00:28:29.333 --> 00:28:31.961
Really? You want me
to share a room with her?

416
00:28:32.795 --> 00:28:35.589
-Weren't you buttering my biscuit?
-Antonia.

417
00:28:35.673 --> 00:28:37.049
What biscuit. Dad?

418
00:28:37.675 --> 00:28:40.845
-That's when adults eat biscuits.
-No.

419
00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:42.763
I want to butter a biscuit!

420
00:28:42.847 --> 00:28:44.932
-Me too!
-No. girls.

421
00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:47.977
Why don't we go explore the hotel.
while your dads

422
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.562
-handle all this.
-Yes.

423
00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:52.189
No. I want to know about the biscuits.

424
00:28:52.273 --> 00:28:54.150
-Look what you've done.
-What?

425
00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:56.819
I thought we'd be
together for the weekend.

426
00:28:56.902 --> 00:29:00.322
I guess we're not.
Luckily. I brought toys.

427
00:29:00.406 --> 00:29:02.116
I brought toys too.

428
00:29:02.533 --> 00:29:05.161
-Antonia. stop.
-Fine. I'll shut up.

429
00:29:05.244 --> 00:29:07.246
It's nothing about you. girl.

430
00:29:07.329 --> 00:29:09.957
I just feel anxious
sharing with a stranger.

431
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.501
-Can you change one to two singles?
-Sure.

432
00:29:12.918 --> 00:29:15.087
You don't mind sleeping alone. baby?

433
00:29:15.171 --> 00:29:18.716
Of course not. I prefer to be alone.
I don't like bad smells.

434
00:29:19.258 --> 00:29:22.761
-What smells?
-We came for a good time. not to argue.

435
00:29:22.845 --> 00:29:24.805
There are smells on the beach.

436
00:29:25.848 --> 00:29:26.849
BE THE NEW STAR BEHIND THE MICROPHONE

437
00:29:30.102 --> 00:29:32.897
What? What's wrong? What's going on?

438
00:29:33.481 --> 00:29:35.816
The Microphone auditions are here!

439
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.028
Can I please sign up? Please. please!

440
00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:40.988
Yes. you can. You can.

441
00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:41.906
I can!

442
00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:44.742
Yes. one question. When are the auditions?

443
00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:46.660
In three days. at the beach.

444
00:29:46.744 --> 00:29:48.579
Did you hear? In three days.

445
00:29:49.246 --> 00:29:51.957
I have three days to rehearse. Daddy!

446
00:29:52.041 --> 00:29:53.667
That's the spirit!

447
00:29:54.376 --> 00:29:56.545
Let's eat
and get to know each other.

448
00:29:56.629 --> 00:29:57.588
Yes. please.

449
00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:01.342
I'm going to the pool.
I need to get over my hangover.

450
00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:02.635
Me too.

451
00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:03.802
-No.
-Please!

452
00:30:03.886 --> 00:30:07.640
-Please. let us go with the crazy lady.
-I heard that.

453
00:30:07.723 --> 00:30:10.351
-Fine. let's go to the pool.
-Yes!

454
00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:24.740
You'll see. Cheaters!

455
00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:31.205
I'm an artist. baby.

456
00:30:33.374 --> 00:30:34.375
So relaxing.

457
00:30:35.417 --> 00:30:39.255
-Where's your girlfriend?
-I don't know. I saved her a spot and...

458
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:41.840
No way.

459
00:31:15.708 --> 00:31:16.750
What will she do?

460
00:31:16.834 --> 00:31:19.628
What? What is she doing?

461
00:31:26.677 --> 00:31:29.263
-Wow! I want to do that!
-Me too!

462
00:31:29.346 --> 00:31:30.389
Girls!

463
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:32.725
Girls. be careful.

464
00:31:37.438 --> 00:31:38.689
-Girls!
-Honey.

465
00:31:38.772 --> 00:31:41.942
-Be careful.
-They'll be fine. They can swim.

466
00:31:45.613 --> 00:31:47.364
One. two. three!

467
00:31:48.991 --> 00:31:51.910
Girls! They belly-flopped!

468
00:31:57.041 --> 00:31:58.042
Step aside. baby.

469
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:01.337
Girls. come here!

470
00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:07.635
-Girls!
-Luna has blood on her face.

471
00:32:07.718 --> 00:32:11.680
Come here! I told you you'd be hurt!

472
00:32:11.764 --> 00:32:13.557
Come here!

473
00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:16.727
Dad. can I go again? Can I go again?

474
00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:22.316
You have a bloody nose. Let's go.

475
00:32:30.658 --> 00:32:32.034
I'm okay. Dad.

476
00:32:32.326 --> 00:32:34.828
-There.
-It hurts.

477
00:32:34.912 --> 00:32:37.790
Of course. you hit your face. I told you.

478
00:32:37.873 --> 00:32:39.375
Take a bath. Let's eat.

479
00:32:39.458 --> 00:32:41.794
-To eat? Really?
-To eat! Yes!

480
00:32:41.877 --> 00:32:44.797
Relax. Calm down. please.

481
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.091
-We're going out to eat!
-Honey.

482
00:32:48.217 --> 00:32:49.927
If you want. I can help them.

483
00:32:50.928 --> 00:32:52.012
You don't mind?

484
00:32:52.096 --> 00:32:55.808
Of course not. They have the best energy!

485
00:32:56.392 --> 00:32:58.060
What would I do without you?

486
00:33:03.941 --> 00:33:04.858
Did you see?

487
00:33:05.859 --> 00:33:06.860
What?

488
00:33:08.237 --> 00:33:10.614
Antonia doesn't have motherly instincts.

489
00:33:11.532 --> 00:33:12.908
What are you saying?

490
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:17.913
What am I saying?
Look. mothers are like wild lionesses.

491
00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:21.709
When they see their cubs in danger.
they dive without thinking.

492
00:33:21.792 --> 00:33:26.588
-What does it have to do with Antonia?
-Well. Antonia didn't do anything.

493
00:33:27.423 --> 00:33:28.424
She just stared.

494
00:33:29.675 --> 00:33:33.220
But the lioness Camila
was about to pounce.

495
00:33:35.264 --> 00:33:37.516
Maybe she didn't think it was serious.

496
00:33:39.309 --> 00:33:41.186
-I don't know.
-Look. Look.

497
00:33:42.312 --> 00:33:45.566
Look.
"Can you come to my room? I'm worried."

498
00:33:46.859 --> 00:33:49.153
She's a sweetheart. I told you. man.

499
00:33:51.739 --> 00:33:52.740
I told you so.

500
00:33:57.828 --> 00:33:58.954
Wait. Wait.

501
00:34:01.707 --> 00:34:04.168
What are you doing?
I didn't see anything.

502
00:34:12.551 --> 00:34:15.095
What's this picture? Is this in Acapulco?

503
00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:18.724
Yes. when my dad got the house keys.

504
00:34:18.807 --> 00:34:20.559
I didn't know you lived here.

505
00:34:21.435 --> 00:34:25.022
It wasn't long. My dad had to rent it.

506
00:34:26.273 --> 00:34:29.193
Can I take a picture? It's beautiful.

507
00:34:32.863 --> 00:34:34.072
Are you ready?

508
00:34:34.823 --> 00:34:37.618
For? God damn!

509
00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:43.290
Baby!

510
00:34:50.214 --> 00:34:51.089
Baby.

511
00:34:52.216 --> 00:34:53.383
When you texted me.

512
00:34:54.134 --> 00:34:56.762
I thought you were worried
about the girls.

513
00:34:57.346 --> 00:35:02.142
The girls? I'm worried because you haven't
buttered my biscuit in two weeks.

514
00:35:05.646 --> 00:35:07.439
Baby. wait.

515
00:35:07.523 --> 00:35:09.066
-What? Why?
-Why don't...

516
00:35:10.484 --> 00:35:14.196
Why didn't you help the girls at the pool?

517
00:35:14.279 --> 00:35:16.156
Because nothing happened.

518
00:35:18.784 --> 00:35:22.830
I mean. yes. Wait.
Yes. but it could have been worse.

519
00:35:23.622 --> 00:35:26.917
But it wasn't. Javier.
Do you know what your problem is?

520
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.214
You think your girls are princesses
that need to be saved. but they're not.

521
00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:36.718
If you keep overprotecting them.
they'll turn into brats like Camila.

522
00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:40.138
Let them get hurt. It's part of life.

523
00:35:40.222 --> 00:35:42.057
Yes. you're right.

524
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.018
Javier. not today.

525
00:35:46.353 --> 00:35:48.772
Baby. yes. Why not? Yes.

526
00:36:03.996 --> 00:36:05.706
-Hi.
-What's up?

527
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.047
Man. you...

528
00:36:14.506 --> 00:36:16.925
-What about me?
-What about you?

529
00:36:17.009 --> 00:36:18.552
You don't remember me?

530
00:36:19.011 --> 00:36:20.596
Do you know this yuppie?

531
00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:22.806
No. I've never seen him.

532
00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:25.851
Don't play dumb.
You do remember my brother. right?

533
00:36:25.934 --> 00:36:27.728
She said she doesn't know you.

534
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:29.938
Who the fuck are you. you bitch?

535
00:36:30.022 --> 00:36:33.150
-Who are you calling a bitch?
-No one. No one.

536
00:36:35.611 --> 00:36:41.533
If you keep bothering my friend.
I'll stick your arm up your butt.

537
00:36:41.617 --> 00:36:43.994
-Are we clear?
-Yes. we are.

538
00:36:45.245 --> 00:36:46.663
Yes.

539
00:36:54.046 --> 00:36:56.006
-Are you okay?
-Yes. thank you.

540
00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.470
Orange juice.

541
00:37:11.271 --> 00:37:12.272
Excuse me.

542
00:37:13.273 --> 00:37:16.443
-How many cans do you drink a day?
-It depends.

543
00:37:16.526 --> 00:37:20.656
When I'm working. I drink five.
when I'm not. two or three.

544
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:25.452
I try not to go over five.
I have to watch my figure.

545
00:37:26.495 --> 00:37:29.831
-Well. at least you think about that.
-Yes.

546
00:37:29.915 --> 00:37:32.334
I'll order another one. Want one?

547
00:37:32.417 --> 00:37:35.504
No. thanks.
I don't drink anything with sugar.

548
00:37:35.879 --> 00:37:37.381
Are you diabetic?

549
00:37:37.464 --> 00:37:39.257
No. No.

550
00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:45.764
I don't like consuming things
that can damage my body.

551
00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:48.558
Okay. What a sad life.

552
00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:50.352
The food's here!

553
00:37:50.435 --> 00:37:52.521
-All right.
-Great. I'm so hungry!

554
00:37:52.604 --> 00:37:54.064
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

555
00:37:54.147 --> 00:37:55.482
I'm starving.

556
00:37:55.565 --> 00:37:56.858
For the princess.

557
00:37:56.942 --> 00:37:58.110
Thanks.

558
00:37:58.193 --> 00:37:59.111
Wait.

559
00:38:00.237 --> 00:38:01.321
Let's give thanks.

560
00:38:02.572 --> 00:38:03.740
Thanks.

561
00:38:03.824 --> 00:38:05.784
Hey. they didn't bring your meat.

562
00:38:05.867 --> 00:38:08.203
-Dude. you forgot their meat!
-No.

563
00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:11.164
No. that's fine.
We don't eat meat. Thanks.

564
00:38:11.248 --> 00:38:13.834
We don't eat any animals.

565
00:38:13.917 --> 00:38:15.585
Your loss. Look.

566
00:38:25.095 --> 00:38:26.888
How are you today?

567
00:38:27.389 --> 00:38:28.390
-Fine!
-Fine!

568
00:38:28.473 --> 00:38:30.017
Louder. How are you today?

569
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.102
-Fine!
-Great!

570
00:38:32.185 --> 00:38:34.271
Are you ready for some karaoke?

571
00:38:34.354 --> 00:38:35.689
Yes!

572
00:38:35.772 --> 00:38:38.734
Get up on stage and rock out!

573
00:38:39.985 --> 00:38:41.611
Dad. can I?

574
00:38:41.695 --> 00:38:42.904
Honey. we're eating.

575
00:38:42.988 --> 00:38:47.492
Dad!
Auditions are in two days. Dad. Two days!

576
00:38:47.576 --> 00:38:51.204
Besides. Lady Gaga's book says
that the best way to practice

577
00:38:51.288 --> 00:38:54.207
-is by singing for an audience.
-Honey. wait.

578
00:38:54.875 --> 00:38:56.793
-Okay. but a quiet one.
-Thanks!

579
00:38:57.961 --> 00:38:59.880
Dad. I forgot my earplugs!

580
00:38:59.963 --> 00:39:01.423
Me too.

581
00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:02.799
Earplugs for what?

582
00:39:02.883 --> 00:39:04.718
To plug my ears.

583
00:39:06.136 --> 00:39:08.555
So dramatic! She can't be that bad.

584
00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:10.891
Go. Sol!

585
00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:33.080
Why would you let her sing?

586
00:39:33.163 --> 00:39:35.499
-She's really bad.
-You get used to it.

587
00:39:35.582 --> 00:39:37.209
Your ears stop working.

588
00:39:38.085 --> 00:39:40.170
It's not that bad.

589
00:39:40.921 --> 00:39:42.422
She's expressing herself.

590
00:39:46.093 --> 00:39:48.136
Let's go somewhere else.

591
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.597
Grab your girl. man.

592
00:39:57.979 --> 00:40:01.525
-Okay. all right.
-No. I want to keep dancing.

593
00:40:01.608 --> 00:40:04.820
Let's go get dessert! Yes.

594
00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:07.823
Follow me on Instagram! Solsita official!

595
00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:10.659
-Let's go.
-It'll help your life!

596
00:40:10.742 --> 00:40:12.577
Follow me!

597
00:40:14.454 --> 00:40:15.497
Delicious.

598
00:40:16.123 --> 00:40:18.917
-Cucumber.
-This is the life.

599
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.627
My ice cream is delicious.

600
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:21.962
What did you get?

601
00:40:22.045 --> 00:40:25.590
-Pistachio. You?
-Strawberry. obviously.

602
00:40:25.674 --> 00:40:27.634
Good. but this one's better.

603
00:40:27.717 --> 00:40:29.094
-Let's see.
-Thief!

604
00:40:29.845 --> 00:40:31.555
-What's this one?
-Let me try.

605
00:40:31.638 --> 00:40:32.639
Vanilla.

606
00:40:39.354 --> 00:40:41.148
Learn how to choose ice cream.

607
00:40:44.276 --> 00:40:45.360
Can I try?

608
00:40:47.988 --> 00:40:49.990
Hey. don't steal my ice cream.

609
00:40:52.742 --> 00:40:54.077
-Baby.
-What?

610
00:40:54.161 --> 00:40:55.412
Your allergy.

611
00:40:56.413 --> 00:40:57.873
I took my pills today.

612
00:41:01.251 --> 00:41:04.671
-Can I have a chocolate one?
-Girl. go check your face.

613
00:41:05.297 --> 00:41:08.133
You look like a mutant puffer fish.

614
00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:09.342
Mutant puffer fish?

615
00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:15.015
Don't be dramatic! Stop staring at me.
It's like you saw a monster.

616
00:41:16.141 --> 00:41:17.309
What's wrong?

617
00:41:41.041 --> 00:41:43.376
What are you doing? This is a hospital!

618
00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:47.130
This is medical incense.
It'll help her recover faster.

619
00:41:47.214 --> 00:41:50.550
What are you talking about?
The doctor said she's fine.

620
00:41:50.634 --> 00:41:53.261
Well. it's alternative medicine.

621
00:41:54.888 --> 00:41:59.684
Hey. do you think we're pushing
this mom thing too much?

622
00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:01.937
I think so.

623
00:42:02.604 --> 00:42:05.232
What if we tell them the truth
and end this?

624
00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:07.525
No. it's too late.

625
00:42:08.276 --> 00:42:11.696
If we tell them the truth.
they'll hate us forever.

626
00:42:13.198 --> 00:42:17.160
And we'll be left alone.
And our daughters without a mom.

627
00:42:17.953 --> 00:42:19.496
What would Cristina think?

628
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.164
Cristina.

629
00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:25.126
She'd understand.

630
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:29.547
Okay. So we keep going.

631
00:42:30.131 --> 00:42:31.716
-We keep going.
-Okay.

632
00:42:42.435 --> 00:42:44.062
Stop it.

633
00:42:44.688 --> 00:42:45.689
Stop it.

634
00:43:04.249 --> 00:43:05.583
Will the brat survive?

635
00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:10.088
It was just allergies.
We'll take her out when she wakes up.

636
00:43:10.672 --> 00:43:13.883
I wish I had recorded it.
It'd have gone viral!

637
00:43:13.967 --> 00:43:15.051
Antonia!

638
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.681
What? It wasn't my idea. Luna told me.

639
00:43:20.473 --> 00:43:22.642
That girl is really something.

640
00:43:22.726 --> 00:43:27.605
I know. Please be careful.
Don't let her play with flammable things.

641
00:43:27.689 --> 00:43:30.025
We got kicked out of a hotel over that.

642
00:43:30.108 --> 00:43:32.277
Don't worry. they're sleeping.

643
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.613
What? It's only 10:00 p.m.
How did you do it?

644
00:43:35.697 --> 00:43:39.284
I have six siblings.
How do you think I studied at night?

645
00:43:39.367 --> 00:43:40.869
I have my tricks.

646
00:43:40.952 --> 00:43:44.372
Thanks for taking care of them.
I know you don't like kids.

647
00:43:44.456 --> 00:43:46.249
-You hate them.
-I hate them.

648
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:50.545
But I can stand these ones.
As long as Sol doesn't sing.

649
00:43:51.171 --> 00:43:54.174
-Antonia. that's bullying!
-It's the truth.

650
00:43:54.758 --> 00:43:57.886
-No. it's not. Well. sometimes.
-She sucks.

651
00:44:11.483 --> 00:44:13.443
-Welcome. baby.
-Thanks.

652
00:44:13.526 --> 00:44:15.445
I arranged the room as you like.

653
00:44:15.528 --> 00:44:18.031
Thanks. Thanks for getting me here.

654
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.116
You need anything else?

655
00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:22.160
No. thanks.

656
00:44:22.243 --> 00:44:25.997
I'll be right down.
I'll try to look prettier. Try to...

657
00:44:27.749 --> 00:44:30.335
Baby. and the girls? Where are they?

658
00:44:30.418 --> 00:44:32.670
They're sunbathing with Antonia.

659
00:44:32.754 --> 00:44:36.925
-In fact. I'll go see them and come back.
-No. I'll see you there.

660
00:44:37.008 --> 00:44:39.135
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

661
00:44:39.219 --> 00:44:41.346
-Don't you fall down.
-I won't.

662
00:44:43.473 --> 00:44:44.349
I'll see you.

663
00:45:09.833 --> 00:45:14.337
We'll see who's the best mom.
Let the war begin.

664
00:45:22.178 --> 00:45:24.013
This tastes great!

665
00:45:35.483 --> 00:45:37.110
-Ask for it next time.
-No.

666
00:45:37.193 --> 00:45:39.612
Who wants to jet ski?

667
00:45:39.696 --> 00:45:40.822
-Let's go!
-Me! Me!

668
00:45:40.905 --> 00:45:42.073
Let's go!

669
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:49.414
There are only three for three adults.
Sorry. honey.

670
00:45:50.415 --> 00:45:52.459
Baby. let's go.

671
00:45:52.542 --> 00:45:55.378
No. you go. I'll stay here.

672
00:45:55.462 --> 00:45:57.297
-Go. go. yes.
-No. why?

673
00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.506
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

674
00:46:29.537 --> 00:46:30.497
Are you okay?

675
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.909
Family!

676
00:47:07.992 --> 00:47:11.120
We're going to fly!

677
00:47:11.204 --> 00:47:12.455
No!

678
00:47:32.267 --> 00:47:34.060
-Go. Dad!
-No. no!

679
00:47:53.413 --> 00:47:54.414
It's for the sun.

680
00:47:55.999 --> 00:47:56.874
Wait. wait.

681
00:48:16.144 --> 00:48:19.772
I'm sorry. ma'am!
I will send you my energies.

682
00:48:29.115 --> 00:48:30.908
-Boom. you hit the lady.
-Yes.

683
00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:33.453
Sol. look. ice creams!

684
00:48:33.536 --> 00:48:35.079
Hurry before they're gone.

685
00:48:35.163 --> 00:48:36.998
-Don't run!
-Don't eat too much!

686
00:48:38.458 --> 00:48:40.168
What a great day.

687
00:48:40.752 --> 00:48:43.838
-Thanks.
-Yes. looks like you had a great time.

688
00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:46.174
-Too bad I wasn't invited.
-You were.

689
00:48:46.257 --> 00:48:48.843
Camila asked for your number. She called.

690
00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:50.928
Yes. I have it here.

691
00:48:51.012 --> 00:48:53.181
I called you...

692
00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:57.894
I'm so stupid. I'm sorry.
I called another Antonia.

693
00:48:58.686 --> 00:49:01.189
I see. you are stupid.

694
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:05.318
We have a plan for tomorrow.
Afternoon family hiking.

695
00:49:05.401 --> 00:49:06.402
You can come.

696
00:49:06.486 --> 00:49:08.363
Great. you already have plans.

697
00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:09.864
No. baby. no plans.

698
00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:12.909
They can change.
but it would be great if you came.

699
00:49:12.992 --> 00:49:15.745
-The girls would love--
-No. no. look.

700
00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:21.584
Don't worry. I made plans to do nothing.
I came for a good time. not to babysit.

701
00:49:21.668 --> 00:49:22.627
I told you.

702
00:49:23.086 --> 00:49:24.212
It's all good.

703
00:49:34.138 --> 00:49:36.974
How are the craziest tourists of Acapulco?

704
00:49:37.058 --> 00:49:38.518
-Fine!
-Fine!

705
00:49:38.601 --> 00:49:42.605
All right. come with that energy tonight.
because tonight

706
00:49:42.689 --> 00:49:45.233
we have Saturday Night Fever.

707
00:49:45.316 --> 00:49:47.819
Come with your best 70's clothes

708
00:49:47.902 --> 00:49:51.155
and we'll do the... Okay?

709
00:49:51.864 --> 00:49:53.991
I love it! I'm excited.

710
00:49:55.159 --> 00:49:57.870
-Excuse me. I'll sing a song before--
-No!

711
00:49:58.871 --> 00:49:59.872
No.

712
00:50:00.832 --> 00:50:03.042
Sol. tomorrow is the audition.

713
00:50:03.584 --> 00:50:06.671
You have to save your voice.
So you sing better.

714
00:50:07.588 --> 00:50:08.965
You'll sing better.

715
00:50:13.761 --> 00:50:15.805
Speaking of that. Antonia.

716
00:50:16.222 --> 00:50:19.058
would you like
to come with me to my audition?

717
00:50:21.185 --> 00:50:22.520
Why me?

718
00:50:23.938 --> 00:50:24.897
I don't know.

719
00:50:25.857 --> 00:50:26.816
I like you.

720
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:28.693
You're very fun.

721
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.240
Sure. I'll go to your audition
with you tomorrow.

722
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:36.117
Great. Yeah.

723
00:50:36.743 --> 00:50:38.411
I hope you can get up early.

724
00:50:39.328 --> 00:50:42.874
Because tomorrow
we'll be at the lobby at 8:00 sharp.

725
00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.711
I'll be at the lobby at 8:00 sharp.

726
00:50:46.794 --> 00:50:48.546
Sleepy. but I'll be there.

727
00:50:51.174 --> 00:50:54.260
-This ice cream is delicious.
-Yes. it is.

728
00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:14.442
Follow me!

729
00:53:19.447 --> 00:53:21.240
I'm jumping. You catch me!

730
00:53:22.909 --> 00:53:24.118
One!

731
00:53:25.494 --> 00:53:28.205
Two. three!

732
00:53:33.044 --> 00:53:33.920
I'm fine.

733
00:53:34.921 --> 00:53:36.505
I'm fine. Let's dance!

734
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:39.216
-Let's dance.
-I'm fine. I'm fine!

735
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.427
-No. you're not.
-I'm fine. Go dance!

736
00:53:42.595 --> 00:53:44.472
-Baby.
-I'm fine! Really.

737
00:54:18.089 --> 00:54:21.342
-What are you doing here?
-Nothing.

738
00:54:21.425 --> 00:54:24.261
I came to ask you if you want to get even.

739
00:54:53.916 --> 00:54:55.918
Fire! Help!

740
00:55:02.216 --> 00:55:05.636
Camila! Open the door!
Baby. what's going on?

741
00:55:07.096 --> 00:55:08.139
Fire!

742
00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:12.101
Run! Run!

743
00:55:12.184 --> 00:55:13.894
Wait. Wait.

744
00:55:15.938 --> 00:55:17.898
I thought we were going to die!

745
00:55:17.982 --> 00:55:19.608
My hair burned.

746
00:55:19.775 --> 00:55:23.654
No. no. Your hair will be fine.
It'll grow back.

747
00:55:23.738 --> 00:55:26.073
-It won't!
-Yes. it will.

748
00:55:26.157 --> 00:55:28.034
You can't even see it.

749
00:55:28.117 --> 00:55:29.660
Okay. Nothing.

750
00:55:29.744 --> 00:55:30.870
Can I keep this?

751
00:55:33.164 --> 00:55:36.292
Let's collect some mollusks
because the slime is good.

752
00:55:37.543 --> 00:55:38.586
Sol. help me.

753
00:55:40.004 --> 00:55:41.005
Okay. baby.

754
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:51.265
Another one. please.

755
00:55:52.767 --> 00:55:53.809
I can't beat her.

756
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:56.812
They love her and hate me.

757
00:55:59.648 --> 00:56:03.027
THE MICROPHONE
MASSIVE AUDITIONS IN ACAPULCO

758
00:56:22.296 --> 00:56:26.175
Well. if you're here to kill me.
can I have dinner first?

759
00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.222
I'm not here to kill you.

760
00:56:32.306 --> 00:56:33.933
I come to make peace.

761
00:56:40.648 --> 00:56:44.401
Sorry about your hair.
It was a joke. but it got out of control.

762
00:56:45.361 --> 00:56:47.696
Hair grows.
and you can have a new look.

763
00:56:49.115 --> 00:56:51.992
It doesn't matter.
Since we're being honest.

764
00:56:53.077 --> 00:56:54.912
I want to apologize too.

765
00:56:56.372 --> 00:56:59.416
I'm sorry I kept you out of all plans.

766
00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:04.255
You know what? I felt threatened by you.

767
00:57:05.548 --> 00:57:07.633
I don't wanna lose the competition.

768
00:57:09.426 --> 00:57:10.678
What competition?

769
00:57:11.345 --> 00:57:12.471
What?

770
00:57:13.806 --> 00:57:16.767
Don't tell me Javier
never told you why we're here.

771
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:22.773
I don't get it. Talk.

772
00:57:23.983 --> 00:57:29.655
Well. Javier and Felipe
brought us both to see who-

773
00:57:30.239 --> 00:57:32.658
would be the best mom for the kids!

774
00:57:47.798 --> 00:57:50.593
Do I look like a mail-order mother?

775
00:57:50.676 --> 00:57:52.052
Why would you say that?

776
00:57:52.136 --> 00:57:54.013
I don't know what you did.

777
00:57:54.096 --> 00:57:57.016
but you can't trick me
into being your kid's mom!

778
00:57:58.184 --> 00:58:02.771
-I swear I was going to tell you.
-When? When I took them to school?

779
00:58:02.855 --> 00:58:06.275
Or when I read them a bedtime story.
fucking liar!

780
00:58:06.859 --> 00:58:07.818
Baby. I'm sorry.

781
00:58:09.195 --> 00:58:11.030
I just wanted you to meet them.

782
00:58:11.113 --> 00:58:14.742
I can meet them. but you can't trick me
into being their mom.

783
00:58:15.784 --> 00:58:19.622
Get it straight. Javier.
I don't ever want to be a mom. Ever.

784
00:58:21.081 --> 00:58:23.000
Wait. what does that mean?

785
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:28.714
This doesn't make any sense.

786
00:58:30.925 --> 00:58:34.511
You're looking for a mom for them.
and I can't give you that.

787
00:58:38.974 --> 00:58:40.726
I think we should break up.

788
00:58:50.402 --> 00:58:52.905
And don't worry. I keep my word.

789
00:58:53.822 --> 00:58:56.492
I'll go to Sol's audition
and leave after it.

790
01:00:00.556 --> 01:00:01.807
Dad. where's Antonia?

791
01:00:02.975 --> 01:00:05.894
I don't know. baby.
She promised she'd be here.

792
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.731
Do you think she overslept?

793
01:00:08.814 --> 01:00:10.107
-No.
-No?

794
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.526
No. she wouldn't be so irresponsible.

795
01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:14.820
She won't answer.

796
01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:16.113
RECENT CALLS

797
01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:18.866
Miss. can you call room 812?

798
01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.284
No problem. sir.

799
01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:26.332
She promised she'd come.

800
01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:30.461
-I know. honey.
-I think no one's there.

801
01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:33.547
Sol.

802
01:00:34.506 --> 01:00:35.466
Baby. look.

803
01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:40.095
I know I may not be
as fun or interesting as Antonia.

804
01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:42.765
but I would never leave you alone.

805
01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.309
Especially on this very important day.

806
01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:50.105
I would love to be
by your side today. if you want.

807
01:00:50.189 --> 01:00:52.149
Really? You don't mind?

808
01:00:52.775 --> 01:00:55.277
No. if I were your mom.

809
01:00:56.028 --> 01:01:00.157
I'd be with you
whenever. wherever. always.

810
01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.334
-Who will sing today?
-I am.

811
01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:11.335
Yes!

812
01:01:13.045 --> 01:01:15.297
-Let's go.
-Let's rock that stage.

813
01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:22.805
There was no connection.

814
01:01:28.477 --> 01:01:31.980
And now. singer 456.

815
01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.566
I can't. I'm too scared.

816
01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:36.819
You practiced so much.
You can do it.

817
01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:37.986
Why isn't she out?

818
01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:42.449
Go. Sol!

819
01:01:42.533 --> 01:01:45.452
-Sing with--
-No. she'll lose her focus. Sit down.

820
01:01:46.412 --> 01:01:50.457
This song is for my mom. who is in heaven.

821
01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:53.335
Mom. this song is for you.

822
01:02:06.849 --> 01:02:07.724
I'm sorry.

823
01:02:13.147 --> 01:02:13.981
I saw that!

824
01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:49.766
SOL YOU ARE #1

825
01:02:58.442 --> 01:02:59.651
I'll be right back.

826
01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:13.165
-What are you doing?
-I'm putting fireworks.

827
01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:15.751
-It'll look better.
-Don't leave her alone.

828
01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:16.710
Okay. Go.

829
01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.053
Let's go.

830
01:04:46.425 --> 01:04:47.884
I don't believe you.

831
01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:55.934
No. no. no.

832
01:04:58.103 --> 01:04:59.563
No. no. no. no!

833
01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:03.317
Antonia. we're waiting.
I know you're mad at me.

834
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.777
but it's not Sol's fault. She's excited.

835
01:05:05.861 --> 01:05:06.945
No!

836
01:05:09.197 --> 01:05:14.036
I hope my soda didn't make you sleepy.
This one's for my hair. Bye!

837
01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:33.639
It was awesome!

838
01:05:33.722 --> 01:05:37.643
Everyone was shouting.
"Sol!" They were clapping.

839
01:05:37.726 --> 01:05:41.021
Imagine a full stadium
and the people shouting!

840
01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:42.439
I have an idea.

841
01:05:43.315 --> 01:05:47.736
I know the best singing teacher.
and I can ask him to coach you.

842
01:05:47.819 --> 01:05:50.238
He coaches all the singers in Mexico.

843
01:05:50.739 --> 01:05:51.657
Yes!

844
01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:53.575
Thank you!

845
01:05:53.659 --> 01:05:55.369
I will be Sol's manager!

846
01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:57.371
There you are. you crazy bitch!

847
01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:06.797
Careful!

848
01:06:57.889 --> 01:06:59.766
Stop! Stop!

849
01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:03.895
Honey!

850
01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:05.397
-Sol!
-Sol!

851
01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.858
What's wrong with you?

852
01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:11.319
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
You know I love her.

853
01:07:11.403 --> 01:07:14.865
You love her? That's why
you stood her up on her big day?

854
01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:18.285
That bitch spiked
my drink with sleeping pills!

855
01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:19.494
Stop it. Antonia!

856
01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:22.122
I think you're right.

857
01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:25.459
We want different things.
This is clearly not working.

858
01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:27.836
-But--
-You should leave.

859
01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:30.589
-But I'm telling--
-Nothing!

860
01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.761
Go.

861
01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:51.109
-It's okay.
-Are you okay?

862
01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:22.933
Is everything okay?

863
01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:27.521
I should've known this would happen.

864
01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:32.025
You never know how things will end.

865
01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:39.199
You did what you thought
was right at that time.

866
01:08:41.368 --> 01:08:42.369
For example.

867
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:45.872
I never thought
I'd have a family with you.

868
01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:49.459
You know what?

869
01:08:52.087 --> 01:08:53.588
I loved the surprise.

870
01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:57.467
I love our family too.

871
01:08:59.845 --> 01:09:01.930
-Really?
-Yes. but don't cry.

872
01:09:02.681 --> 01:09:04.307
The feeling. man.

873
01:09:12.858 --> 01:09:13.692
Here.

874
01:09:19.155 --> 01:09:21.992
It's Cristina's ring. I can't accept it.

875
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:26.705
This is Cristina's ring.
and I want you to give it to Camila.

876
01:09:28.373 --> 01:09:31.251
She's clearly
the best mom to our daughters.

877
01:09:33.962 --> 01:09:35.630
I need to talk to the girls.

878
01:09:35.714 --> 01:09:38.049
-I haven't talked to them--
-I did.

879
01:09:38.592 --> 01:09:41.928
They let you marry Camila.
They gave their approval.

880
01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:46.683
Don't cry. man!

881
01:09:51.146 --> 01:09:52.480
-I'll calm down.
-Yes.

882
01:09:52.564 --> 01:09:55.108
-Calm down.
-I have to collect myself.

883
01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.819
I have to channel my energy
into the wedding.

884
01:09:57.903 --> 01:09:58.778
Exactly.

885
01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:02.908
A wedding. a house.
But we'll still sleep together. right?

886
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.660
Not all the time. that's weird.

887
01:10:05.744 --> 01:10:08.455
-Sometimes. right?
-We have to buy another bed.

888
01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.041
Thank you.

889
01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:14.502
I'll burn my feet.

890
01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:46.743
Camila.

891
01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:53.124
Will you be a part of the family
as my wife?

892
01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.627
My daughters' mom?

893
01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:58.296
Yes. yes!

894
01:11:04.511 --> 01:11:07.430
She said yes. girls! Girls. she said yes!

895
01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:09.349
I said yes!

896
01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:24.609
They're sugar free.

897
01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:26.986
It's still chocolate. Take them.

898
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.071
Okay.

899
01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:32.200
What is this?

900
01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:37.997
It says "Zolpidem."

901
01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:41.167
Take them.

902
01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:25.962
Run. run!

903
01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:27.297
Girls!

904
01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:33.761
You are going too far! Stop!

905
01:14:38.433 --> 01:14:40.059
Come here! Come!

906
01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:44.147
Stop! Stop! Now!

907
01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:48.443
I don't know where you get these things.

908
01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:51.946
What's this?

909
01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:56.034
-It was in Camila's bag.
-Shut up.

910
01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:02.916
Was this in Camila's bag?

911
01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:06.085
Yes. Dad. Sorry.

912
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:10.965
Didn't Antonia say Camila drugged her?

913
01:15:11.466 --> 01:15:12.800
That's right.

914
01:15:12.884 --> 01:15:16.596
She said Camila spiked
her soda with sleeping pills.

915
01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:18.723
And that's why she slept so much.

916
01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:22.685
This was in her bag too?

917
01:15:24.896 --> 01:15:26.356
Who bought a soda?

918
01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:28.441
Camila.

919
01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:30.109
Hey. wait.

920
01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:33.655
Camila buying a soda
doesn't mean she did it.

921
01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:36.157
Maybe she wanted one. I always want one.

922
01:15:36.241 --> 01:15:40.495
Yes. and it could have happened.
except she doesn't consume sugar.

923
01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:43.122
It's true!

924
01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:47.627
So. Camila put Antonia to sleep
so she'd miss my sister's audition?

925
01:15:48.419 --> 01:15:51.256
You can't trust someone
who doesn't eat sugar.

926
01:15:51.339 --> 01:15:52.924
Damn liar!

927
01:15:53.007 --> 01:15:55.635
Luna. we don't discriminate diabetics.

928
01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:56.886
Sorry. Dad.

929
01:15:57.929 --> 01:16:00.056
What do we do? The wedding is soon.

930
01:16:03.518 --> 01:16:05.728
We have to tell your dad.

931
01:16:05.812 --> 01:16:08.773
-Run. run!
-My bag! My bag!

932
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.626
Is this a joke?

933
01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:30.586
Dad. how could we be joking?

934
01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:33.548
Your girlfriend put Antonia to sleep.

935
01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:39.637
Camila is an angel. girls.
Why would she do something like that?

936
01:16:39.721 --> 01:16:42.849
Open your eyes.
She wanted to win the girls over.

937
01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:46.602
You're afraid of what's coming. So am I.

938
01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:50.481
It's not easy to welcome
someone new to the family.

939
01:16:50.565 --> 01:16:51.899
but give her a chance.

940
01:16:51.983 --> 01:16:54.235
I'm not afraid of that. Felipe.

941
01:16:54.319 --> 01:16:57.739
but of a liar entering our lives.
our daughters' lives.

942
01:16:57.822 --> 01:17:01.200
Look. no liar is entering our lives.

943
01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:04.829
Just someone
dying to have a family with us.

944
01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:06.831
-Dad. please!
-Stop.

945
01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:07.915
Enough.

946
01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:11.878
Stop playing detective.

947
01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:15.256
I have to go get things ready.
I'll see you in two hours.

948
01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:16.174
-But--
-Hey.

949
01:17:28.895 --> 01:17:30.813
-Can you torch the wedding?
-Yes.

950
01:17:30.897 --> 01:17:33.649
What? Are you crazy?
That's a horrible idea.

951
01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:38.237
-Can you?
-Yes. of course.

952
01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:39.697
No. that's wrong!

953
01:17:40.365 --> 01:17:41.574
We need a plan.

954
01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:43.826
Antonia would know what to do.

955
01:17:44.369 --> 01:17:46.287
If only she were here.

956
01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:48.414
I guess she's back in Mexico City.

957
01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:54.295
No. she's not there.
Her concierge said she didn't arrive.

958
01:17:54.379 --> 01:17:55.922
Then. where is she?

959
01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:07.266
What happened?

960
01:18:09.227 --> 01:18:13.523
Girls. if Dad runs. you run. Run.

961
01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:25.910
Dad. do you really think
your girlfriend is at this dump?

962
01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:28.121
-I have a hunch.
-Then. let's go.

963
01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:29.539
I'm going.

964
01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:32.041
Girls. I have to do this alone.

965
01:18:32.125 --> 01:18:33.876
Dad. we just want to help.

966
01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.462
I know. but this is a couple's thing.

967
01:18:36.546 --> 01:18:37.964
I have to do it alone.

968
01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:39.715
Trust me. okay?

969
01:18:39.799 --> 01:18:42.385
Then go! We don't have that much time.

970
01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:43.761
Yes. I'm going.

971
01:18:46.639 --> 01:18:49.267
-Run!
-Stop. I said I was going.

972
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.561
Where did you get your neurosis from?

973
01:18:53.563 --> 01:18:54.564
Calm down.

974
01:19:04.699 --> 01:19:05.700
Anto.

975
01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:15.918
Go--

976
01:19:17.003 --> 01:19:18.379
Javier. damn!

977
01:19:18.463 --> 01:19:21.174
Are you okay?

978
01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:25.720
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm not fine. but I will be.

979
01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:29.515
-How did you know I was here?
-I didn't.

980
01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:32.268
I had a hunch.

981
01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:37.106
You talked about this place.

982
01:19:39.942 --> 01:19:40.985
I came for you.

983
01:19:42.904 --> 01:19:44.363
I do listen to you.

984
01:19:46.908 --> 01:19:48.242
Only when you want to.

985
01:19:49.202 --> 01:19:50.453
I know.

986
01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:55.625
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
You were right. Camila is a liar.

987
01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:59.504
We have to stop the wedding
so Felipe's life isn't ruined.

988
01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:04.884
No. Javier. we don't have to go.
You have to go.

989
01:20:07.053 --> 01:20:09.805
I can't trust you after you abandoned me.

990
01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:12.016
Look. Antonia.

991
01:20:13.768 --> 01:20:16.687
Antonia. I made a mistake.

992
01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:22.026
If you don't want to see me anymore.
I'll understand.

993
01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:26.113
But please. try to understand me.

994
01:20:28.032 --> 01:20:29.075
I was afraid.

995
01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:34.664
Afraid my daughters wouldn't be happy
without a normal family.

996
01:20:36.666 --> 01:20:37.959
For not having a mom.

997
01:20:40.086 --> 01:20:42.380
We did what we thought was right.

998
01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:45.174
Just like your dad

999
01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:48.219
did what he did for you.

1000
01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:50.221
Renting this house.

1001
01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:54.308
I made a mistake. but...

1002
01:20:56.686 --> 01:20:57.687
I'm sorry.

1003
01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:04.235
Javier. thank you.

1004
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:08.656
You're looking for
a mom for your daughters.

1005
01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:11.701
That's beautiful.

1006
01:21:14.579 --> 01:21:16.372
But I can't be that person.

1007
01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:20.918
It's best if you leave.

1008
01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:25.214
I'm sorry.

1009
01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:02.418
Dad. and Antonia?

1010
01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:04.337
She's not coming.

1011
01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:06.505
What should we do now?

1012
01:22:10.468 --> 01:22:11.594
I don't know.

1013
01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:16.974
Anto!

1014
01:22:17.058 --> 01:22:19.101
I'll tell you once. Javier.

1015
01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:21.937
don't ever trick
or turn your back on me again.

1016
01:22:22.021 --> 01:22:25.149
We're a team.
and I want to be a team for a long time.

1017
01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:26.359
Yes. I promise.

1018
01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:30.154
Believe it or not. you make me
the happiest person in the world.

1019
01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:35.368
-Kiss. kiss.
-Kiss!

1020
01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:38.746
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1021
01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:42.583
I love you. idiot!

1022
01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:49.382
Okay. enough cheesiness.

1023
01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:52.051
What's up? What's going on?

1024
01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:53.678
Okay. This is the thing.

1025
01:22:53.761 --> 01:22:56.681
Camila put you to sleep.
and Dad won't believe us.

1026
01:22:56.764 --> 01:22:58.724
-What should we do?
-We need

1027
01:22:58.808 --> 01:23:02.269
more proof so Camila
won't marry my dad in a few hours.

1028
01:23:02.353 --> 01:23:03.312
Any ideas?

1029
01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.691
Yes. go back to the hotel.

1030
01:23:07.692 --> 01:23:08.818
But fast!

1031
01:23:10.945 --> 01:23:12.029
Fast. you said?

1032
01:23:34.385 --> 01:23:35.428
Watch out. Dad!

1033
01:23:38.264 --> 01:23:41.726
-Dad. look ahead!
-Be careful!

1034
01:23:45.813 --> 01:23:48.190
Why are they crossing?

1035
01:23:48.274 --> 01:23:49.942
-I'm driving!
-Pay attention!

1036
01:24:16.761 --> 01:24:21.056
Buddy. we're looking for a yuppie.
Open shirt. chest hair. an asshole.

1037
01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:24.602
Miss. that's all the guys here.
Be more specific. please.

1038
01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:28.022
He talks like with a potato in his mouth.

1039
01:24:28.105 --> 01:24:32.026
Oh. yes. I saw him.
He's over there with his friends.

1040
01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:33.569
-Thanks. man.
-Thanks!

1041
01:24:35.738 --> 01:24:36.947
What's with you?

1042
01:24:37.782 --> 01:24:39.158
This isn't the yuppie.

1043
01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:41.660
-Which one is it?
-They all look the same.

1044
01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:45.873
-Girl. you again?
-That one.

1045
01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:47.208
-Him?
-That's him.

1046
01:24:49.627 --> 01:24:50.544
Run!

1047
01:24:57.885 --> 01:24:59.303
-Got you!
-Okay.

1048
01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:02.348
I didn't do anything to your friend.
Don't kill me.

1049
01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:04.558
Shut up! I just want some answers.

1050
01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:07.686
-Okay.
-How do you know Camila?

1051
01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:10.564
-What did she do? Tell me everything!
-Come on!

1052
01:25:34.213 --> 01:25:37.174
We're gathered here on this beautiful day.

1053
01:25:37.258 --> 01:25:41.554
in this fantastic place.
to celebrate the marriage--

1054
01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:42.638
I object!

1055
01:25:45.015 --> 01:25:46.559
What are you doing?

1056
01:25:47.184 --> 01:25:50.688
It's not that part yet. What am I doing?

1057
01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:53.941
Saving my friend
from making the worst mistake ever.

1058
01:25:54.525 --> 01:25:57.361
Are you still on that?
Camila is a good woman.

1059
01:25:57.444 --> 01:26:00.281
-She'll be our daughters' mom.
-Listen to me.

1060
01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:03.868
That woman is only with you
because you have a family.

1061
01:26:03.951 --> 01:26:07.204
She's obsessed with having a family.

1062
01:26:07.288 --> 01:26:08.914
What is he talking about?

1063
01:26:08.998 --> 01:26:13.085
Don't listen to me.
listen to what this yuppie has to say.

1064
01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:14.169
Come here. moron.

1065
01:26:15.754 --> 01:26:17.131
-Hurry. asshole!
-Hi.

1066
01:26:17.214 --> 01:26:19.216
At least. listen to this yuppie.

1067
01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:21.468
-What's your name?
-Javi. man.

1068
01:26:22.052 --> 01:26:24.930
Yuppie. The yuppie.
Tell him about your brother.

1069
01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:30.811
Hey. bro. sorry to ruin your day.
but that girl ruined my brother's life.

1070
01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:34.189
She left him with stress--

1071
01:26:34.273 --> 01:26:36.317
-PTSD.
-Yes. PTSD.

1072
01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.527
I don't understand. What did she do?

1073
01:26:38.611 --> 01:26:40.738
She forced my brother to adopt.

1074
01:26:41.488 --> 01:26:44.033
What's wrong with that? That's beautiful.

1075
01:26:44.116 --> 01:26:47.202
-No. she wanted to adopt 10 kids.
-10.

1076
01:26:47.286 --> 01:26:49.914
She was obsessed with having a family.

1077
01:26:49.997 --> 01:26:53.292
so everyone would get the love
she didn't have as a kid.

1078
01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:58.547
Man. after the honeymoon. which was crazy.
she went to every orphanage in Mexico

1079
01:26:58.631 --> 01:27:01.133
to find the lucky 10.

1080
01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:03.969
When he came back.
she had hired six women.

1081
01:27:04.053 --> 01:27:06.347
and I have five. man.

1082
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:09.308
She built 10 extra-large rooms
in the house.

1083
01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:13.729
she bought a five-row bus
for family trips.

1084
01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:16.357
My brother couldn't take it.

1085
01:27:17.107 --> 01:27:20.653
He always wanted a family.
but this was too much for him.

1086
01:27:22.029 --> 01:27:26.909
Bro. she's only marrying you
for your family. man.

1087
01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:29.870
Be careful. man. That chick's crazy.

1088
01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:31.914
Thanks.

1089
01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:38.170
Is that true?

1090
01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:42.508
Are you with me for my girls?

1091
01:27:43.342 --> 01:27:46.095
-Or are you in love with me?
-No. for both.

1092
01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:51.058
First. because of your beautiful family.
but I fell in love with you.

1093
01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:52.893
I can't believe it.

1094
01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:55.562
No. look.

1095
01:27:56.063 --> 01:27:59.984
Look. everything I've done
was to save our family.

1096
01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:03.654
Yes. maybe I overdid it
with the amount of kids.

1097
01:28:03.737 --> 01:28:05.531
but I promise it won't happen.

1098
01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:06.782
I promise.

1099
01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:10.035
I'm happy with Sol and Luna.
I don't need anyone else.

1100
01:28:11.036 --> 01:28:13.622
-Please. don't destroy our family.
-Tell me.

1101
01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:17.334
Did you drug Antonia
to miss Sol's audition?

1102
01:28:19.712 --> 01:28:22.840
-Yes. With my pills.
-Okay.

1103
01:28:24.717 --> 01:28:26.301
No...

1104
01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:29.888
You lied to me.

1105
01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:33.058
I can't be with you.

1106
01:28:34.226 --> 01:28:35.894
-Don't do this to me.
-Sorry.

1107
01:28:35.978 --> 01:28:38.856
No. please. Don't do this to me.

1108
01:28:38.939 --> 01:28:41.191
-I'm the best mom for them.
-Calm down.

1109
01:28:41.275 --> 01:28:42.818
I'm the best mom!

1110
01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:43.944
This ring's mine.

1111
01:28:44.028 --> 01:28:46.447
-No!
-No. that's Cristina's ring!

1112
01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:47.865
No!

1113
01:29:14.308 --> 01:29:15.851
Luna! Luna!

1114
01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:18.312
Help me!

1115
01:29:22.608 --> 01:29:23.692
My sister.

1116
01:29:23.776 --> 01:29:24.985
Sol. stay here!

1117
01:29:25.069 --> 01:29:26.945
-I'll help them.
-Okay.

1118
01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:31.742
-We have to lift this.
-One. two. three.

1119
01:29:31.825 --> 01:29:33.327
Tiger strength. come on!

1120
01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:44.546
Why isn't my sister coming out?

1121
01:29:47.424 --> 01:29:49.551
-Help me!
-Hurry up!

1122
01:29:55.557 --> 01:29:57.810
-Why isn't my sister coming out?
-Luna!

1123
01:30:12.866 --> 01:30:15.119
-Luna! Luna!
-Luna! Luna!

1124
01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:17.037
Breathe. Luna.

1125
01:30:17.121 --> 01:30:18.080
Careful!

1126
01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:20.290
I'm drowning! I'm drowning!

1127
01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:25.254
There. Someone do something!

1128
01:30:25.337 --> 01:30:26.922
-Luna!
-Sister!

1129
01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:28.715
Someone do CPR!

1130
01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:32.052
I know what we have to do.

1131
01:30:32.136 --> 01:30:32.970
-What?
-What?

1132
01:30:33.053 --> 01:30:34.513
-I know.
-A doctor!

1133
01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:35.931
A chakra cleanse.

1134
01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:38.267
-Are you serious!
-What are you saying?

1135
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:40.644
-Luna! Luna!
-A chakra cleanse.

1136
01:30:41.145 --> 01:30:42.688
One. two. chakra cleanse!

1137
01:30:48.402 --> 01:30:50.737
Wait. wait.

1138
01:30:50.821 --> 01:30:54.408
What do you think I have? Ready?
One. two. three!

1139
01:30:56.118 --> 01:30:57.661
Really?

1140
01:30:58.203 --> 01:30:59.746
Tickles!

1141
01:31:01.039 --> 01:31:03.292
The chakras!

1142
01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:26.190
Girls. Dad and I wanted to apologize.

1143
01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:28.567
Apologize for what?

1144
01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:31.778
For not telling you everything.

1145
01:31:33.822 --> 01:31:37.701
This trip wasn't only for our anniversary.

1146
01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:40.329
but to find you a mom.

1147
01:31:41.622 --> 01:31:42.873
Why did you do that?

1148
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.920
Because after your fight at school.

1149
01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:53.342
we thought you needed maternal energy.

1150
01:31:54.468 --> 01:31:57.554
And we can't give you that.

1151
01:31:58.430 --> 01:32:03.060
Dads. we have the best moms in the world.

1152
01:32:04.102 --> 01:32:09.024
You two.
With dads like you. we don't need moms.

1153
01:32:10.609 --> 01:32:13.153
So. why did you fight?

1154
01:32:13.862 --> 01:32:17.449
Because we are tired
that no one at school understands

1155
01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:19.993
you're both mom and dad at the same time.

1156
01:32:24.498 --> 01:32:26.583
-I need a hug.
-Me too.

1157
01:32:32.047 --> 01:32:33.173
-Come!
-Come!

1158
01:32:33.257 --> 01:32:37.135
Anyone else needs a hug?
Someone needs to be a part of this hug.

1159
01:32:37.219 --> 01:32:38.470
Yes. yes.

1160
01:32:42.516 --> 01:32:44.476
Dad. I need to tell you a secret.

1161
01:32:52.317 --> 01:32:53.277
Are you sure?

1162
01:32:54.027 --> 01:32:56.029
-Yes.
-You know what?

1163
01:32:56.738 --> 01:32:58.949
I have another secret.

1164
01:33:01.618 --> 01:33:02.869
You guys are crazy!

1165
01:33:02.953 --> 01:33:04.997
-We're crazy?
-Yes. we are.

1166
01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.290
Kiss attack!

1167
01:33:23.974 --> 01:33:27.060
That's Sol's number.
She wanted me to give it to you.

1168
01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:32.858
Why? I don't understand.

1169
01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:36.653
To tell her about the music coach.

1170
01:33:38.655 --> 01:33:40.365
And take her there.

1171
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:47.622
Despite everything I did.
you want me to take her?

1172
01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:51.335
Didn't you promise?

1173
01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:54.254
If you want to be family.

1174
01:33:56.131 --> 01:33:57.799
you must keep your promises.

1175
01:33:59.217 --> 01:34:00.927
You want me in the family?

1176
01:34:04.389 --> 01:34:05.390
I don't know.

1177
01:34:06.058 --> 01:34:10.312
I don't know. but Sol reminded me
Javier didn't want me in the family.

1178
01:34:11.938 --> 01:34:13.190
and look at us.

1179
01:34:21.198 --> 01:34:23.200
Everyone deserves a second chance.

1180
01:34:27.371 --> 01:34:29.956
Felipe. despite of what I did.

1181
01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:32.751
I do love you.

1182
01:34:38.924 --> 01:34:41.843
Well. we'll go step by step.

1183
01:34:42.969 --> 01:34:45.138
We can be friends. and we'll see.

1184
01:34:46.598 --> 01:34:47.516
In time.

1185
01:34:57.150 --> 01:34:58.110
Thank you.

1186
01:34:58.902 --> 01:35:02.989
Thank you for being
a lioness and saving Luna.

1187
01:35:07.953 --> 01:35:09.162
Want some ice cream?

1188
01:35:12.749 --> 01:35:14.167
Can it be lactose free?

1189
01:35:14.793 --> 01:35:16.545
A vegan one?

1190
01:35:18.004 --> 01:35:19.005
Lactose free.

1191
01:35:22.551 --> 01:35:23.552
-Shall we?
-Yes.

1192
01:35:38.191 --> 01:35:40.110
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY

1193
01:36:16.104 --> 01:36:19.441
Excuse me.
You can't do that. There are trash cans.

1194
01:36:19.524 --> 01:36:21.568
-Who?
-Who what?

1195
01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:22.819
Who asked you?

1196
01:36:24.696 --> 01:36:25.739
So nosy.

1197
01:36:29.242 --> 01:36:30.243
Are you okay?

1198
01:36:31.578 --> 01:36:32.454
Hey.

1199
01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:42.631
Are you okay?

1200
01:36:43.673 --> 01:36:45.300
Well. of course you aren't.

1201
01:36:49.513 --> 01:36:51.681
-You look bad.
-I'm sick.

1202
01:37:01.983 --> 01:37:04.611
I'm really sick. I feel horrible.

1203
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:07.113
Are you pregnant?

1204
01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:10.867
No. that's impossible.

1205
01:37:11.576 --> 01:37:12.953
My doctor says I can't.

1206
01:37:13.537 --> 01:37:15.288
My body isn't ready yet.

1207
01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:17.332
Doctors make mistakes.

1208
01:37:17.415 --> 01:37:20.210
They told my parents
I'd be a boy. and look.
