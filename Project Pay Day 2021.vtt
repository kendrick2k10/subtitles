3
00:00:24.883 --> 00:00:28.390
Good afternoon.
Walsh High School.

4
00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:30.887
It is that time
of the year again.

5
00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:33.725
Seniors. don't forget to
clean out your lockers

6
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.595
by the end of the day.

7
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.335
Note. we will not hold
onto your things for you.

8
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.832
We will see everyone else
next year.

9
00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:45.110
Don't forget to have
a great summer.

10
00:00:56.915 --> 00:01:00.785
- Man. I can't wait
to just do nothing.

11
00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:04.624
- Look. Dave.
I'm not saying

12
00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.230
it's your worst effort ever.

13
00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.397
but it certainly leaves
a lot to be desired.

14
00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:10.058
It'd be so simple to just. say.

15
00:01:10.093 --> 00:01:11.961
have the correct number
of electrons?

16
00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:13.270
I mean. you're only missing one.

17
00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:15.569
- Yeah. yeah.
Whatever. electrons. Okay.

18
00:01:15.604 --> 00:01:18.572
Look. I'm telling you
it's all about the presentation!

19
00:01:18.607 --> 00:01:20.145
Maybe if you get
this model spinning.

20
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.774
no one will care about
how many electrons it's got.

21
00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:25.447
Look. I'm thinking like hook up
a motor rig on the bottom

22
00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:26.910
so it does the spin. Yeah?

23
00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:27.779
- Oh. Yeah. And you're going
to do all of that

24
00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:29.550
in the next five minutes?

25
00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:30.947
- Five minutes?

26
00:01:30.982 --> 00:01:32.289
It was five minutes
five minutes ago!

27
00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:33.488
- It's really a quick fix.

28
00:01:33.523 --> 00:01:34.456
You just need
one more electron--

29
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:35.952
- Don't--don't listen to her.

30
00:01:35.987 --> 00:01:37.591
Look. you get this thing
in motion

31
00:01:37.626 --> 00:01:40.462
and Johnson will let you
teach the class next year.

32
00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:43.399
- Nah. I think it's done.

33
00:01:56.942 --> 00:01:58.249
- Yeah. I mean.
you're right. dude.

34
00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.185
You don't need that kind of
responsibility anyway.

35
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:14.089
- I wonder when
they're gonna release

36
00:02:14.124 --> 00:02:15.761
the summer reading list
for the fall.

37
00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:17.664
I've heard that sophomore
year's much more rigorous.

38
00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:18.995
academically.

39
00:02:19.998 --> 00:02:21.338
- Yow. Curtis!

40
00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:23.703
I hear you can make it
so I can get an "A" in Algebra.

41
00:02:23.738 --> 00:02:25.375
- That might be true.

42
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.871
But it's not gonna be
for free though.

43
00:02:26.906 --> 00:02:28.840
I'm thinking 30 bucks.

44
00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:31.007
Hey. man. you know.
you really want that "A".

45
00:02:31.042 --> 00:02:32.107
- Yeah.

46
00:02:32.142 --> 00:02:34.516
- Perfect. All right.
you got it. dude.

47
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:37.145
- Ah. Curtis.
how're you gonna make it

48
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.388
so he gets an "A" in Algebra?

49
00:02:38.423 --> 00:02:39.884
- Ah. I am not.

50
00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.325
- But you just said--

51
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.393
- I said it might be true.
And who knows?

52
00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:45.791
Maybe tomorrow it will be.
But probably not.

53
00:02:45.826 --> 00:02:46.957
- So. what's gonna happen

54
00:02:46.992 --> 00:02:48.024
when he realizes
he's not getting an "A"?

55
00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.366
Freshman!
- Whoo.

56
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:50.301
- Where's the "A"
you promised me?

57
00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.632
- Whoa. buddy! Look

58
00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:52.864
I--I can totally see
how you misunderstood.

59
00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:54.833
but what I actually said was.
it might be true.

60
00:02:54.868 --> 00:02:55.834
- Hey!

61
00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:56.901
- Okay.

62
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:01.070
- Stupid freshmen.

63
00:03:01.105 --> 00:03:02.709
- That wasn't

64
00:03:02.744 --> 00:03:04.909
Man. somebody should do
something about that guy.

65
00:03:04.944 --> 00:03:06.218
- Ugh.

66
00:03:12.457 --> 00:03:14.919
Uhm. thanks for sticking up
for me back there.

67
00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:16.954
- I thought you handled yourself
quite well.

68
00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:20.562
- Man. the seniors
have got it made.

69
00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:21.728
Done with school.

70
00:03:21.763 --> 00:03:23.235
Basically. just
endless summer vacation

71
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.929
for the rest of their lives.

72
00:03:24.964 --> 00:03:26.568
- What?
Dude. are you kidding me?

73
00:03:26.603 --> 00:03:27.932
They're screwed.

74
00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:29.934
They wish they still had
three years left of summer.

75
00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:31.738
- Yeah. I find that
hard to believe.

76
00:03:31.773 --> 00:03:33.839
- Well. don't take
my word for it.

77
00:03:33.874 --> 00:03:34.939
Follow me.

78
00:03:42.047 --> 00:03:43.079
Summer jobs!

79
00:03:44.654 --> 00:03:47.787
The number one killer
of summer fun.

80
00:03:47.822 --> 00:03:50.119
And the ultimate price
to be paid

81
00:03:50.154 --> 00:03:51.626
for being in your late teens.

82
00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:53.859
- But aren't we entering
our late teens?

83
00:03:53.894 --> 00:03:56.026
- Yeah. I mean.
15 is mid-teens.

84
00:03:56.061 --> 00:03:58.798
You know. 15 is the year
of the optional summer job.

85
00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:00.866
Once you hit 16.
that's when they make you

86
00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:02.131
start earning money.

87
00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:04.100
- Well. earning money
does have the upside of

88
00:04:04.135 --> 00:04:05.574
the money.

89
00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:06.971
I think I definitely
I want to earn money someday.

90
00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:10.414
- I'd literally pay money
not to have to earn money.

91
00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:11.910
- And we get by okay!

92
00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:14.176
And we rock a thrift store
like no one else.

93
00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:17.080
Hey. what's up. wiener?

94
00:04:22.527 --> 00:04:23.988
- You know.
you realize next summer.

95
00:04:24.023 --> 00:04:25.330
we'll be 16?

96
00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.925
- Yeah.
And we'll be the wieners.

97
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.663
- Well. yeah.
But that's next summer.

98
00:04:28.698 --> 00:04:30.467
That's why it's so important
that this summer

99
00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:32.062
be something truly special!

100
00:04:32.097 --> 00:04:32.997
- What do you have in mind?

101
00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:36.935
- Whatever we want!

102
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.740
You know. that's the whole point
of freedom.

103
00:04:39.775 --> 00:04:43.579
While those poor sops are
out there scooping up dog crap.

104
00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:45.482
we'll be having adventures.

105
00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:48.353
- Well. are you thinking
of any specific adventures?

106
00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:49.816
- Anything we can imagine!

107
00:04:49.851 --> 00:04:51.279
You know. think big!

108
00:04:51.314 --> 00:04:53.820
- Well. I think we should have
a brainstorming session.

109
00:04:53.855 --> 00:04:54.986
You know.
narrow down our ideas

110
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:57.021
based on feasibility
and general interest.

111
00:04:57.056 --> 00:05:00.431
and then we can start talking
logistics and execution.

112
00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.191
- Yeah. Lotta big words
in that sentence.

113
00:05:02.226 --> 00:05:03.962
but I'm looking
for some big ideas.

114
00:05:03.997 --> 00:05:05.931
- Well. we're going to
need to plan our pool days

115
00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:07.933
around the Fourth of July
to avoid crowds.

116
00:05:07.968 --> 00:05:09.033
and any long-distance adventures

117
00:05:09.068 --> 00:05:11.200
will require transport
other than bikes.

118
00:05:11.235 --> 00:05:12.773
And those will require
permission.

119
00:05:12.808 --> 00:05:15.039
- Come on. Hannah. pool? Really?

120
00:05:15.074 --> 00:05:17.382
Think big.
Think the moon!

121
00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:20.110
- Or we could just hang out.

122
00:05:20.145 --> 00:05:23.113
I mean. we've got video games.
and food and drink.

123
00:05:23.148 --> 00:05:25.181
knick-knacks.

124
00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:26.985
We could hit up
a garage sale or two.

125
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.053
Just chill.

126
00:05:29.088 --> 00:05:31.121
- But. Dave.
we do that every weekend.

127
00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:33.530
- Yeah. come on.
last summer ever. remember?

128
00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:34.960
Like think big!

129
00:05:34.995 --> 00:05:35.961
- I don't know.
All that big thinkin'

130
00:05:35.996 --> 00:05:38.128
sounds kind of exhausting.

131
00:05:38.163 --> 00:05:43.166
I mean. planning around things.
and permission. feasibility

132
00:05:44.268 --> 00:05:48.006
- Yeah. No.
Move over.

133
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:49.579
I don't know
what I was thinking.

134
00:05:49.614 --> 00:05:51.878
- What?
So. no brainstorming session?

135
00:05:51.913 --> 00:05:54.848
- Hannah. you are welcome
to brainstorm all you want.

136
00:05:54.883 --> 00:05:58.885
but you also have the high score
and as per clubhouse rules.

137
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.427
that allows us to challenge
the reigning champ at any time.

138
00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:04.055
- I challenge the champ.

139
00:06:05.795 --> 00:06:07.894
- Hannah? Hannah?

140
00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:10.094
- Come on.
- Hannah.

141
00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:16.067
- Fine.

142
00:06:16.102 --> 00:06:18.443
I'm so excited to do nothing
with you guys this summer.

143
00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:19.906
- Yes. there we go.

144
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:21.105
Mission to launch.

145
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.416
In three. two. one.

146
00:06:26.717 --> 00:06:28.079
- Hey. guys.
uh. I'm gonna head out.

147
00:06:28.114 --> 00:06:29.278
I'm gonna meet up
with Curtis and Hannah.

148
00:06:29.313 --> 00:06:30.521
I think I'll be going--

149
00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:33.282
- No. no. no. no!
Sit. buster.

150
00:06:33.317 --> 00:06:35.053
We're gonna start having
dinners together

151
00:06:35.088 --> 00:06:36.890
as a family this summer. Sit!

152
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.633
- So. how are you
and your friends

153
00:06:43.668 --> 00:06:45.965
planning on spending the summer?

154
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.297
- Uh. I don't know.
Uh. play some video games.

155
00:06:48.332 --> 00:06:50.805
Hang out.
Have fun. I guess.

156
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.873
That's what
I thought you'd say.

157
00:06:52.908 --> 00:06:54.710
- Well. at least I'm consistent.

158
00:06:54.745 --> 00:06:56.976
That's my boy!

159
00:06:57.011 --> 00:06:58.208
Listen. what your mom's
trying to say--

160
00:06:58.243 --> 00:06:59.484
- What we're saying is that

161
00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:01.717
it's time for you
to get a summer job.

162
00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:06.117
- Very funny.

163
00:07:06.152 --> 00:07:08.284
- What's very funny?

164
00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.989
- I'm 15 years old.

165
00:07:11.828 --> 00:07:14.092
It's the year of
the optional summer job.

166
00:07:14.127 --> 00:07:15.764
- Says who?

167
00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:17.634
- I think
it's in the US Constitution.

168
00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:19.834
Could you pass
that salad dressing?

169
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:21.836
- It's not in the Constitution.

170
00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:23.002
- It must be in the Bible. then.

171
00:07:23.037 --> 00:07:24.003
- It's not in the Bible either.

172
00:07:24.038 --> 00:07:25.807
- Have you read the whole Bible?

173
00:07:25.842 --> 00:07:28.579
- Dave. you're getting
a summer job.

174
00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:31.582
It's time you learn
the value of responsibility.

175
00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:33.749
Now. your father and I
are happy to help you find one.

176
00:07:33.784 --> 00:07:36.752
if you need us.
but wherever you work.

177
00:07:36.787 --> 00:07:39.282
I expect to see
a nice fat bank balance

178
00:07:39.317 --> 00:07:41.592
by the time
August rolls around.

179
00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.693
- Bank balance?

180
00:07:43.728 --> 00:07:44.925
You're serious?

181
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.828
- Yeah.
That's the point of a job. son!

182
00:07:46.863 --> 00:07:48.599
I mean. take your mom
for instance. right.

183
00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:50.029
She built this business
from the ground up.

184
00:07:50.064 --> 00:07:53.934
and fully dedicated herself
to all the consulting.

185
00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:56.101
and advising.
and the promoting--

186
00:07:56.136 --> 00:08:00.105
- The point is to see
the fruits of your hard work.

187
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.812
Advising local retailers
on the benefits and strategies

188
00:08:03.847 --> 00:08:05.440
of community engagement.

189
00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:08.344
- Right.
And that hard work pays off.

190
00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:09.521
Exactly. I know.

191
00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:11.347
Community
benefits advising

192
00:08:11.382 --> 00:08:13.118
Anyway. think of the happiness
your mom gets

193
00:08:13.153 --> 00:08:14.856
when she brings home
her hard-earned money

194
00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:16.154
and put a roof over your head

195
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:18.156
and put all this food
on the table.

196
00:08:18.191 --> 00:08:20.829
That is payoff!

197
00:08:20.864 --> 00:08:22.490
So. at the end
of the summer.

198
00:08:22.525 --> 00:08:25.328
you'll have the experience
of using your own money

199
00:08:25.363 --> 00:08:27.671
to buy your
back-to-school supplies.

200
00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:28.837
We'll go together!

201
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.642
- Back to school ?

202
00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:35.910
- Yep. And you know what?
I'm already proud of you. son.

203
00:08:37.111 --> 00:08:38.044
It's gonna be a good summer.

204
00:08:38.079 --> 00:08:39.078
Yeah.

205
00:08:42.886 --> 00:08:44.919
You guys are
never going to believe this.

206
00:08:44.954 --> 00:08:46.151
- They're making you
get a summer job.

207
00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:47.823
- My parents
are making me get

208
00:08:47.858 --> 00:08:48.989
how did you know that?

209
00:08:49.024 --> 00:08:50.089
- Because my parents
said the same thing.

210
00:08:50.124 --> 00:08:51.893
I have to get one too.

211
00:08:51.928 --> 00:08:54.599
- What happened to
"optional." Curtis?

212
00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:58.031
- It's cruel and unusual!
It's inhumane!

213
00:08:58.066 --> 00:08:59.901
I think it violates
the Geneva Convention!

214
00:08:59.936 --> 00:09:01.870
- Believe me.
I was up all night. checking.

215
00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:03.234
- Yeah. Curtis. I don't know
where you're getting

216
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:05.940
your information from.
but it's clearly out of date.

217
00:09:05.975 --> 00:09:07.711
My parents said that
now that we're in high school.

218
00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:09.779
it's time to grow up
and take some responsibility.

219
00:09:09.814 --> 00:09:11.341
- My parents said
the same thing.

220
00:09:11.376 --> 00:09:12.683
What. are they
coordinating this?

221
00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:14.784
- No. That's it!
It's a conspiracy!

222
00:09:14.819 --> 00:09:16.852
It's collusion!
It's price-fixing.

223
00:09:16.887 --> 00:09:17.952
We'll take 'em to court!

224
00:09:17.987 --> 00:09:19.184
You guys didn't agree
to anything. right?

225
00:09:19.219 --> 00:09:20.449
- I couldn't even get a word in!

226
00:09:20.484 --> 00:09:23.122
- Good. Hannah?

227
00:09:23.157 --> 00:09:26.191
I I already have
three interviews scheduled.

228
00:09:26.226 --> 00:09:27.555
- What?
- I'm sorry.

229
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.095
My parents said that I need to
take some risks!

230
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.636
You know. chart my own path.
and make some money of my own.

231
00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.803
What's so great about money?

232
00:09:33.838 --> 00:09:36.465
We got all this great stuff
for pennies.

233
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.807
Thrift shops. yard sales

234
00:09:37.842 --> 00:09:40.139
and it's worth so much
because of how we found it.

235
00:09:40.174 --> 00:09:42.075
not what we paid for it.

236
00:09:43.144 --> 00:09:45.716
- Wait. what'd your mom
say about money?

237
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:47.916
- That at the end of the summer.
she's gonna check my account

238
00:09:47.951 --> 00:09:51.722
and that the balance
better be fat.

239
00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:52.921
- Same deal?

240
00:09:54.089 --> 00:09:56.584
So. we make some money!

241
00:09:56.619 --> 00:09:58.861
If that's what they care about.
we can do that!

242
00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:02.557
Okay. How much money
do you need to make in a summer?

243
00:10:02.592 --> 00:10:06.935
- Ah. Minimum wage
is about seven dollars an hour.

244
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.398
30 hours a week.

245
00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:10.840
It's about ten weeks
till the end of August.

246
00:10:10.875 --> 00:10:12.138
Twenty-one hundred dollars.

247
00:10:12.173 --> 00:10:15.779
- Okay. Times two
to cover both of you is

248
00:10:15.814 --> 00:10:18.408
uh. carry the one uh.

249
00:10:18.443 --> 00:10:20.850
- It's 4.200 dollars.

250
00:10:20.885 --> 00:10:21.950
- We can totally make that!

251
00:10:21.985 --> 00:10:23.116
Yeah. by getting summer jobs.

252
00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:25.250
- No. We could do
that in a week!

253
00:10:25.285 --> 00:10:28.957
We just gotta do something easy
that has a really great pay-off!

254
00:10:28.992 --> 00:10:30.420
And then we spend the rest
of the summer kickin' it!

255
00:10:30.455 --> 00:10:31.795
- Oh. Get-rich-quick. you mean?

256
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.830
Because that worked out
so well for so many people.

257
00:10:33.865 --> 00:10:35.700
- No. but we'll be different.

258
00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:36.833
We'll be smart about it!

259
00:10:36.868 --> 00:10:38.362
- Oh. 'cause nobody
ever said that before

260
00:10:38.397 --> 00:10:40.870
- Even if we did make
4.200 dollars in a week.

261
00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:42.102
our parents
would still expect us

262
00:10:42.137 --> 00:10:45.039
to go to work every day.

263
00:10:45.074 --> 00:10:47.778
- Yeah.
Well. that's the easy part.

264
00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:48.944
We lie.

265
00:10:48.979 --> 00:10:50.781
And tell them what?

266
00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:53.883
- Doesn't matter.
We just make up a fake job.

267
00:10:53.918 --> 00:10:56.281
You could be. uh. a lifeguard.

268
00:10:56.316 --> 00:10:57.887
and then you could be
a librarian!

269
00:10:57.922 --> 00:11:00.021
- No. No!
I can't lie like that.

270
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:03.024
- And have you met my mom?

271
00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:05.829
Nothing will come between me

272
00:11:05.864 --> 00:11:07.391
and my goals.

273
00:11:07.426 --> 00:11:09.063
Repetition makes habits. right?

274
00:11:09.098 --> 00:11:11.065
So. repeat your affirmations.

275
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.397
- I am confident.
I am capable.

276
00:11:13.432 --> 00:11:14.871
I will reach my goal.

277
00:11:14.906 --> 00:11:17.775
Because what
you focus on becomes true.

278
00:11:18.943 --> 00:11:21.207
Nothing
will come between me

279
00:11:21.242 --> 00:11:22.208
and my goals.

280
00:11:22.243 --> 00:11:23.748
- Uh cool.

281
00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:25.409
Do you mind if I come
between you and the fridge?

282
00:11:26.577 --> 00:11:28.412
- Don't make fun
of my affirmations.

283
00:11:28.447 --> 00:11:30.051
Clearly visualizing
what you want

284
00:11:30.086 --> 00:11:31.822
is a great way
to make it happen.

285
00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:36.024
- Oh. well. visualizing myself
with a glass of milk.

286
00:11:37.027 --> 00:11:39.929
Hey. it works!

287
00:11:39.964 --> 00:11:40.864
- Hilarious.

288
00:11:43.264 --> 00:11:45.396
Speaking of making things
happen.

289
00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:46.562
shouldn't you
be getting dressed?

290
00:11:46.597 --> 00:11:47.937
- For what?

291
00:11:47.972 --> 00:11:48.905
- You've got to start
looking for a new job.

292
00:11:50.205 --> 00:11:51.600
- I don't even get
a single day off?

293
00:11:51.635 --> 00:11:54.273
- No. Start early.
start strong!

294
00:11:54.308 --> 00:11:56.077
- That doesn't answer
my question.

295
00:11:56.112 --> 00:11:58.079
- We should have started
this process earlier.

296
00:11:58.114 --> 00:11:59.850
but I believe in you.

297
00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:01.346
And if you can't find
anything this late.

298
00:12:01.381 --> 00:12:03.887
I'll be happy to have you
as my intern.

299
00:12:03.922 --> 00:12:04.888
The Bayside Mall
is going to need

300
00:12:04.923 --> 00:12:06.219
a lot of extra help this summer.

301
00:12:06.254 --> 00:12:08.221
They've had
a spate of shoplifting

302
00:12:08.256 --> 00:12:12.764
and I am here
to restore community confidence.

303
00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:14.095
- But hold on a second.

304
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.195
if you're gonna be spending
all day with your mom.

305
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.933
I have dibs on the evenings!

306
00:12:16.968 --> 00:12:18.033
'Cause I know your mom.

307
00:12:18.068 --> 00:12:19.199
she can't be having
all the Dave-time.

308
00:12:19.234 --> 00:12:20.200
- huh!
- Ah

309
00:12:20.235 --> 00:12:21.366
Well. actually. the truth is.

310
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:23.533
I--I stopped by the pool
on the way home.

311
00:12:23.568 --> 00:12:26.602
and I got a job.
As a lifeguard.

312
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.736
- You did?

313
00:12:28.771 --> 00:12:29.737
- Are you certified for that?

314
00:12:29.772 --> 00:12:31.475
- Well. when does it start?

315
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:32.784
- August 30th.

316
00:12:34.084 --> 00:12:35.545
Wh-Which is why I told them
I needed something sooner

317
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.756
so they're gonna let me
start next week.

318
00:12:39.782 --> 00:12:40.825
- Fantastic!

319
00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:44.895
Wow. Good for you.

320
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.490
-Way
to grab the bull

321
00:12:46.525 --> 00:12:47.898
by the horns. son.

322
00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:49.658
Eat up. Get strong.

323
00:12:54.632 --> 00:12:55.972
So. now what?

324
00:12:56.007 --> 00:12:57.666
- Now what. what?

325
00:12:57.701 --> 00:13:01.076
- I told my mom
I got a job at the pool.

326
00:13:01.111 --> 00:13:02.770
- You got a job
down at the pool?

327
00:13:02.805 --> 00:13:04.013
Yo. congrats!

328
00:13:04.048 --> 00:13:06.950
- The job isn't real.
The job is a lie.

329
00:13:06.985 --> 00:13:09.282
You told me to lie
about having a job.

330
00:13:09.317 --> 00:13:10.415
That was the plan.

331
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.891
So I'm saying I'm in.
so now what?

332
00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:16.993
- Oh.
Yes. of course. the plan!

333
00:13:17.028 --> 00:13:20.326
The plan! Operation

334
00:13:20.361 --> 00:13:21.899
Let's Have a Great Summer!

335
00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:24.462
Yeah. all right. Yeah.
We'll work on that name.

336
00:13:24.497 --> 00:13:28.004
But. dude. congrats.
Welcome aboard.

337
00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:29.973
First order of business:
A mascot!

338
00:13:30.008 --> 00:13:31.876
And I saw just the thing.

339
00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:39.312
We'll call him Mr. Moneybags.

340
00:13:39.347 --> 00:13:41.215
and he represents
all the cash we're gonna make

341
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.986
to get you out
of your summer job.

342
00:13:43.021 --> 00:13:46.352
- It's called Maneki-neko.
and it represents good fortune.

343
00:13:46.387 --> 00:13:48.354
- Yeah. Literally
what I just said.

344
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:49.487
Are you buying another book?

345
00:13:49.522 --> 00:13:51.720
- Curtis! Plan!

346
00:13:51.755 --> 00:13:55.526
Mascots are great. but what's
our plan to make 4.200 dollars?

347
00:13:55.561 --> 00:13:57.902
My life depends on it!

348
00:14:00.533 --> 00:14:01.873
- Okay.

349
00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:04.304
You guys ever hear of
the Calvin Labash coin robbery?

350
00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:05.976
The what?

351
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:10.178
- Last year. a masked thief
robbed an antique coin shop.

352
00:14:10.213 --> 00:14:11.377
It's a store downtown

353
00:14:11.412 --> 00:14:14.017
owned by a man named
Calvin Labash.

354
00:14:14.052 --> 00:14:15.887
Labash hit the silent alarm.

355
00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:17.713
but by the time
the police arrived.

356
00:14:17.748 --> 00:14:19.352
the thief had already run off.

357
00:14:19.387 --> 00:14:20.991
carrying dozens of gold coins

358
00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:23.158
worth hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

359
00:14:23.193 --> 00:14:25.160
The police spotted him
and chased him.

360
00:14:25.195 --> 00:14:27.261
But he disappeared
down an alley.

361
00:14:27.296 --> 00:14:29.032
It would've been
the perfect crime.

362
00:14:29.067 --> 00:14:30.726
except for one thing.

363
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:33.828
Labash recognized the cologne
the thief was wearing.

364
00:14:33.863 --> 00:14:37.238
He only knew one person
who wore that particular scent:

365
00:14:37.273 --> 00:14:40.604
none other than
City Councilman Ron Haft.

366
00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:41.836
- Why would he do that?

367
00:14:41.871 --> 00:14:43.013
- Apparently.
some politicians lie

368
00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:45.246
about their financial status.

369
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:48.876
Anyway. the police
questioned Councilman Haft

370
00:14:48.911 --> 00:14:51.021
and they even searched
his home and office.

371
00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:53.551
But they found no sign
of the gold coins.

372
00:14:53.586 --> 00:14:56.928
Still. Labash was certain
that Haft had stolen them.

373
00:14:56.963 --> 00:14:59.557
So he went
and confronted him directly.

374
00:14:59.592 --> 00:15:04.298
Tempers flared. and Labash
ended up killing Haft.

375
00:15:04.333 --> 00:15:07.939
Calvin Labash was arrested
for the murder of Ron Haft

376
00:15:07.974 --> 00:15:10.073
and was sentenced to
life in prison.

377
00:15:10.108 --> 00:15:12.570
But he killed himself
the week his sentence began.

378
00:15:14.937 --> 00:15:16.772
And no one heard
another thing about it.

379
00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:20.985
- This felt extremely off-topic.

380
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.956
- The coins. Dave!
The coins were never found!

381
00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:27.255
Haft must have hidden them
somewhere in the city!

382
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.817
And we're gonna find them!

383
00:15:28.852 --> 00:15:31.259
- Sorry. Curtis.
but if this is your big plan.

384
00:15:31.294 --> 00:15:32.821
I do not consent.

385
00:15:32.856 --> 00:15:35.263
I'm better off just going to
my interviews and taking a job.

386
00:15:35.298 --> 00:15:37.397
- Curtis. I cannot believe you.

387
00:15:37.432 --> 00:15:40.004
For once. you came up with
a realistic-sounding idea

388
00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:42.270
and this is how
we're gonna accomplish it?

389
00:15:42.305 --> 00:15:43.975
Hunting through the city
for a treasure

390
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.306
that probably
doesn't even exist.

391
00:15:45.341 --> 00:15:46.604
- Hey. hey. hey!

392
00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:48.144
Look. I know it sounds
a little far-fetched

393
00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:49.508
- Oh. a little?

394
00:15:49.543 --> 00:15:51.312
- But no need to get personal!

395
00:15:51.347 --> 00:15:54.909
'Cause I've got a Plan B.
I always have a Plan B!

396
00:15:54.944 --> 00:15:56.955
- Yeah. your middle name
is Plan B.

397
00:15:59.388 --> 00:16:01.586
- So. I'm listening!

398
00:16:01.621 --> 00:16:02.686
- Uhhh

399
00:16:03.986 --> 00:16:05.458
A garage sale.

400
00:16:05.493 --> 00:16:07.097
A garage sale.
We hold a garage sale.

401
00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:08.527
- You just came up
with that this very minute.

402
00:16:08.562 --> 00:16:10.199
- Look. we sell our stuff.

403
00:16:10.234 --> 00:16:13.499
Our clubhouse has got years
of accumulated merchandise.

404
00:16:13.534 --> 00:16:15.501
All that's gotta be worth
more than 4.000.

405
00:16:15.536 --> 00:16:16.964
- But how are we supposed to
have a fun summer

406
00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:19.439
without all of our stuff?

407
00:16:19.474 --> 00:16:22.046
- Maybe Curtis is right. Dave.

408
00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:23.542
I mean. it's just stuff.

409
00:16:23.577 --> 00:16:25.940
And besides. Operation
Let's All Have a Great Summer

410
00:16:25.975 --> 00:16:27.282
- Not committed to that name.

411
00:16:27.317 --> 00:16:30.186
- was always just about us
spending it together.

412
00:16:30.221 --> 00:16:31.550
I mean. we could
make that choice.

413
00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:32.683
We could sacrifice our stuff

414
00:16:32.718 --> 00:16:34.190
for one last
easy summer together.

415
00:16:35.193 --> 00:16:36.357
- Are you saying you're in?

416
00:16:36.392 --> 00:16:37.886
- Heck. yes. she is.

417
00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:40.724
- All right.
Let's make some summer money.

418
00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:42.957
- So we can have
some summer fun.

419
00:16:42.992 --> 00:16:44.332
Garage sale!

420
00:16:44.367 --> 00:16:47.038
- Okay. But where are we
going to hold it?

421
00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:48.963
- I don't know.
What about your uncle's?

422
00:16:51.506 --> 00:16:53.902
So. we thought
we'd come to you. Uncle Brad.

423
00:16:53.937 --> 00:16:56.641
since you're family and all.

424
00:16:56.676 --> 00:17:00.876
- So. you want to
sell all of your clubhouse gear

425
00:17:00.911 --> 00:17:04.011
and knickknacks to buy
a present for your mom?

426
00:17:04.046 --> 00:17:05.815
- Well. not just any present!

427
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.016
Uh. you know those motivational
videos that she likes?

428
00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:11.194
Well. there's an online guru

429
00:17:11.229 --> 00:17:14.593
that has a whole course
that we want to get her!

430
00:17:14.628 --> 00:17:17.893
- Yeah. she's really into those.

431
00:17:17.928 --> 00:17:19.598
But our garage is full up
now that Uncle Michael

432
00:17:19.633 --> 00:17:21.996
has the new self-driving
electric car.

433
00:17:22.031 --> 00:17:25.538
- Yes. But they could use
the front porch and the yard.

434
00:17:25.573 --> 00:17:29.773
- Right. But you're also
asking me to lie to my sister.

435
00:17:29.808 --> 00:17:33.843
- Not lie!
Just not fully disclose.

436
00:17:33.878 --> 00:17:34.910
- Oh.

437
00:17:34.945 --> 00:17:36.285
We need to keep our eye
on that one.

438
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.452
- It should be a surprise.
after all!

439
00:17:38.487 --> 00:17:39.882
We just want to do something
really nice for her

440
00:17:39.917 --> 00:17:42.489
before we start our summer jobs.

441
00:17:43.888 --> 00:17:45.195
- Uh. I just don't know

442
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.021
if I can keep something
like that from Megan.

443
00:17:47.056 --> 00:17:50.398
She has a way of dragging
the truth out of people.

444
00:17:51.401 --> 00:17:53.236
- Look. I get it. Yeah.

445
00:17:53.271 --> 00:17:56.030
I told Dave that you guys
would never go for this.

446
00:17:56.065 --> 00:17:58.802
You know. kids shouldn't be
encouraged to dream.

447
00:17:58.837 --> 00:18:01.607
have big ideas. right?
It's just too risky.

448
00:18:01.642 --> 00:18:04.280
Dave almost had me convinced
that you guys were different.

449
00:18:04.315 --> 00:18:07.041
That you'd see we just wanted
to do something nice for his mom

450
00:18:07.076 --> 00:18:08.614
because she works
really. really hard.

451
00:18:08.649 --> 00:18:11.078
But. you know.
I'm with you guys.

452
00:18:11.113 --> 00:18:13.454
You know. can't take a chance
on a kid's dream.

453
00:18:15.293 --> 00:18:17.293
Look. you can't
blame 'em. buddy.

454
00:18:17.328 --> 00:18:19.658
You know. they're just adults.

455
00:18:19.693 --> 00:18:21.627
They're all like that.

456
00:18:21.662 --> 00:18:23.992
We'll just. uh.
figure something else out.

457
00:18:26.931 --> 00:18:28.601
- Okay. Wait. wait. wait!

458
00:18:29.802 --> 00:18:32.066
O--okay.
You-- you can do it.

459
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:33.672
- Really?
-  Yes.

460
00:18:33.707 --> 00:18:35.311
- Okay. so the sale
will be on Saturday

461
00:18:35.346 --> 00:18:36.312
from noon to five.

462
00:18:36.347 --> 00:18:37.973
We have a lot of stuff.

463
00:18:38.008 --> 00:18:39.480
so we're gonna need your help
driving everything over here.

464
00:18:39.515 --> 00:18:41.515
and we're gonna need to store
everything in your basement.

465
00:18:42.815 --> 00:18:44.683
- We've just been played.
haven't we?

466
00:18:44.718 --> 00:18:46.157
- I told you
to watch out for him!

467
00:19:02.901 --> 00:19:03.999
- Oh. hey. Mom!

468
00:19:04.034 --> 00:19:05.275
I just put my work schedule
on the fridge

469
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.673
so I don't forget it.

470
00:19:07.708 --> 00:19:08.971
- Dave!

471
00:19:09.006 --> 00:19:11.809
I have never known you
to be so conscientious.

472
00:19:11.844 --> 00:19:14.548
You are really
taking this by storm!

473
00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.782
Are you nervous?

474
00:19:17.817 --> 00:19:19.322
- About what?

475
00:19:19.357 --> 00:19:21.291
- Well. you're going to be in
charge of saving people's lives.

476
00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:22.688
- When?

477
00:19:22.723 --> 00:19:23.821
- At the pool.

478
00:19:25.187 --> 00:19:28.397
- Because I'm a lifeguard
at the pool!

479
00:19:28.432 --> 00:19:30.531
No. I'm not!

480
00:19:30.566 --> 00:19:31.565
Nervous! I mean.

481
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.897
I'm not-- I'm not nervous.

482
00:19:33.932 --> 00:19:37.340
Um. you know. I gotta go!
It's a really long bike ride!

483
00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:38.473
- Well. hold on. hold on.

484
00:19:38.508 --> 00:19:39.870
You have another hour.
so sit down.

485
00:19:39.905 --> 00:19:42.411
I'll make you breakfast
and then I'll drive you over.

486
00:19:42.446 --> 00:19:43.412
- No. Dad! No.

487
00:19:43.447 --> 00:19:45.315
Uh. I want to get there myself.

488
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.175
If you're gonna do something.
do it all the way! Right?

489
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.913
- Yeah. Uh. yeah.

490
00:19:49.948 --> 00:19:52.179
Wake up determined.
go to bed satisfied!

491
00:19:52.214 --> 00:19:54.049
- Okay. bye.

492
00:19:54.084 --> 00:19:56.425
- Truer words. Dad!
Truer words!

493
00:20:29.493 --> 00:20:34.496
Upon a summer's day

494
00:20:39.635 --> 00:20:43.604
Filled with envy

495
00:20:45.641 --> 00:20:50.611
To pass the time away

496
00:21:46.867 --> 00:21:48.163
- You guys look ready.

497
00:21:48.198 --> 00:21:49.164
- Not quite!

498
00:21:53.676 --> 00:21:54.642
For luck.

499
00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:03.882
- Wow. you have
a lot of great stuff here.

500
00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:10.361
Would you take 25?

501
00:22:11.859 --> 00:22:16.862
My lucky day

502
00:22:18.195 --> 00:22:21.064
Hey hey my lucky day

503
00:22:25.675 --> 00:22:28.071
Or to be told

504
00:22:28.106 --> 00:22:33.109
It's my lucky day

505
00:22:34.618 --> 00:22:37.850
It's my lucky day hey hey

506
00:22:54.363 --> 00:22:57.034
Or to be told

507
00:22:57.069 --> 00:22:59.608
It's my lucky day

508
00:23:17.254 --> 00:23:19.089
- So. how much did we make?

509
00:23:19.124 --> 00:23:20.860
- I'm counting. I'm counting!

510
00:23:20.895 --> 00:23:21.993
- Well?

511
00:23:23.425 --> 00:23:24.864
- Four thousand two hundred
thirty seven dollars

512
00:23:24.899 --> 00:23:26.129
and twenty five cents.

513
00:23:26.164 --> 00:23:27.966
We did it.
We actually did it!

514
00:23:28.001 --> 00:23:29.935
- Well. didn't I
tell you guys to trust me?

515
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.366
- Dude. you're saving me a whole
summer's worth of hard labor.

516
00:23:32.401 --> 00:23:33.367
- That's what
I'm talking about.

517
00:23:33.402 --> 00:23:34.643
Hey. buddy!

518
00:23:34.678 --> 00:23:36.744
Sir. what are you
doing with that?

519
00:23:36.779 --> 00:23:37.910
- How much you want for it?

520
00:23:37.945 --> 00:23:39.879
- We made enough. Curtis.

521
00:23:39.914 --> 00:23:41.650
- Well. how much
is it worth to ya?

522
00:23:41.685 --> 00:23:42.915
- It's a piece of junk.
Five bucks?

523
00:23:44.083 --> 00:23:45.489
- You'll have to do
better than that!

524
00:23:45.524 --> 00:23:47.315
- But the sign says
everything must go.

525
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.724
- If it's a piece of junk.
why do you want it so much?

526
00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:51.627
Curtis!
- You can't have it!

527
00:23:59.428 --> 00:24:00.966
- Five thousand dollars?

528
00:24:01.001 --> 00:24:03.771
How does a new windshield
cost 5.000 dollars?

529
00:24:03.806 --> 00:24:06.576
- That windshield could
probably drive the car for you.

530
00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.908
- I don't think Uncle Brad
is gonna rat us out

531
00:24:08.943 --> 00:24:11.746
but that's only because
we gave him the 4.200 bucks

532
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:13.341
we made from selling our stuff.

533
00:24:13.376 --> 00:24:17.851
So. eventually. we're gonna have
to pay him back the difference.

534
00:24:17.886 --> 00:24:19.149
- You do realize that this means

535
00:24:19.184 --> 00:24:21.349
that your brilliant.
simple. can't-miss

536
00:24:21.384 --> 00:24:22.922
Operation
Let's All Have a Great Summer

537
00:24:22.957 --> 00:24:24.352
- We're changing that name!

538
00:24:24.387 --> 00:24:26.354
- has only been in operation
for a single week.

539
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:28.499
and we're already
800 dollars in the hole!

540
00:24:29.491 --> 00:24:30.963
- Look. guys.

541
00:24:30.998 --> 00:24:32.459
Look. this doesn't
actually change anything.

542
00:24:32.494 --> 00:24:33.966
You know. our goal
is still the same.

543
00:24:34.001 --> 00:24:36.837
just. you know.
numbers are a little fudged.

544
00:24:36.872 --> 00:24:37.970
- But this was
your only good idea

545
00:24:38.005 --> 00:24:39.675
on how to make any money at all.

546
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.808
- You lie. sir!

547
00:24:40.843 --> 00:24:42.975
I never lie. Curtis.

548
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.274
- Look. my best idea
still stands!

549
00:24:45.309 --> 00:24:46.440
- What idea?

550
00:24:46.475 --> 00:24:48.552
- The Labash Coin Robbery!

551
00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:49.982
Look. what I didn't tell you is.

552
00:24:50.017 --> 00:24:52.985
I think I know
where the stolen coins are!

553
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.756
The Chinatown Tunnels!

554
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:57.022
- That's an urban legend.

555
00:24:57.057 --> 00:25:00.993
- Oooohhhh.
Or perfect hiding place?

556
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.700
Look. the thief
stole the coins on foot.

557
00:25:04.735 --> 00:25:06.933
so he had to have
some kind of getaway. right?

558
00:25:08.167 --> 00:25:10.002
And if Councilman Haft
did steal the coins

559
00:25:10.037 --> 00:25:11.465
and hide them somewhere.

560
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.302
then the secret underground
Chinatown Tunnels

561
00:25:13.337 --> 00:25:14.875
would have been
the perfect place.

562
00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:16.811
And as City Councilman.

563
00:25:16.846 --> 00:25:18.582
he would have known
the exact location.

564
00:25:20.179 --> 00:25:22.047
That's why the police
didn't find the coins

565
00:25:22.082 --> 00:25:23.510
when they searched his office.

566
00:25:23.545 --> 00:25:26.117
Because he hid them
in the tunnels!

567
00:25:28.055 --> 00:25:32.926
- Dude. my mom thinks
I have a job at the pool.

568
00:25:32.961 --> 00:25:35.731
She expects me to have
cold hard cash in my account

569
00:25:35.766 --> 00:25:37.392
in less than two months.

570
00:25:37.427 --> 00:25:41.869
So. if you do not downshift
into a realistic gear.

571
00:25:41.904 --> 00:25:43.398
she is gonna find out.

572
00:25:43.433 --> 00:25:47.534
and you are literally going to
find my body out in the bay.

573
00:25:47.569 --> 00:25:49.041
- Stay the course. my friend.
All right?

574
00:25:49.076 --> 00:25:51.373
Summer's not even half over yet.

575
00:25:51.408 --> 00:25:54.915
And. as always.
I have a Plan B.

576
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:56.378
- Well. don't you mean Plan C?

577
00:25:56.413 --> 00:25:58.787
- That's the spirit!
Okay. Mall.

578
00:25:58.822 --> 00:26:00.514
Tomorrow morning. first thing.

579
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:03.550
And all you gotta bring
is your hunger for the summer.

580
00:26:03.585 --> 00:26:07.389
We'll call this
Operation Sweet Life!

581
00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:10.326
We've gotta work on that name.

582
00:26:15.069 --> 00:26:16.035
Shortcuts aren't always good

583
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.300
in the long run.

584
00:26:17.335 --> 00:26:19.709
The path may not be
straight or clear.

585
00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:21.975
so just keep your eyes
on your goal.

586
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.977
And repeat your affirmations.

587
00:26:24.012 --> 00:26:26.914
because what you focus on
becomes true.

588
00:26:29.985 --> 00:26:31.578
- Why are you all dressed up?

589
00:26:31.613 --> 00:26:35.054
- Oh. I'm meeting with a few
new retail clients at the mall.

590
00:26:35.089 --> 00:26:36.957
- The mall?

591
00:26:36.992 --> 00:26:39.927
- A couple of the
high-end stores are being
shoplifted regularly.

592
00:26:39.962 --> 00:26:42.457
Antiques. handmade keepsakes.

593
00:26:42.492 --> 00:26:44.899
They're considering
posting a reward.

594
00:26:44.934 --> 00:26:46.494
Even the staff
is being affected.

595
00:26:47.937 --> 00:26:51.004
I am confident. I am capable.
I will reach my goal.

596
00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:54.139
- Dave. do you plan
on saving any lives today?

597
00:26:54.174 --> 00:26:55.140
- Just one.

598
00:26:55.175 --> 00:26:57.010
- Hop to it. Mr. Lifeguard!

599
00:26:57.045 --> 00:26:59.441
Don't let your mom
catch you being late for work!

600
00:26:59.476 --> 00:27:00.508
- But I just--
- Come on.

601
00:27:00.543 --> 00:27:02.015
Uh. do you want me to drive you!

602
00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:03.445
I could drive you.

603
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.688
Are you sure?

604
00:27:07.154 --> 00:27:08.516
'Cause I don't mind
driving you.

605
00:27:15.162 --> 00:27:17.294
- So. my mom is going to be
all over this mall today.

606
00:27:17.329 --> 00:27:19.098
so we gotta
keep our eyes peeled.

607
00:27:19.133 --> 00:27:20.627
- What do we say
if we run into her?

608
00:27:20.662 --> 00:27:22.838
- Don't worry. I'll handle
anything that happens.

609
00:27:22.873 --> 00:27:26.006
This is where our prize is.
this is where we gotta be.

610
00:27:36.018 --> 00:27:37.314
Sorry.
- S'okay.

611
00:27:46.325 --> 00:27:47.995
- So. this is our big prize?

612
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.128
A jar of jelly beans?

613
00:27:49.163 --> 00:27:50.899
We might as well
play the lottery.

614
00:27:50.934 --> 00:27:52.835
We risk running into my mom
for this?

615
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.661
- Ah. It's only gambling
if you're guessing.

616
00:27:54.696 --> 00:27:55.805
- So what. we each take a guess?

617
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.467
- No. They'll be guessing.
We won't be!

618
00:27:58.502 --> 00:27:59.468
That's part two.

619
00:27:59.503 --> 00:28:00.843
- Excuse me!

620
00:28:00.878 --> 00:28:02.207
- Oh! Sorry.

621
00:28:08.853 --> 00:28:11.854
- So. what is part two?

622
00:28:11.889 --> 00:28:13.053
- You'll see!

623
00:28:13.088 --> 00:28:14.648
- Hey. we used to have
a lamp just like this

624
00:28:14.683 --> 00:28:15.858
back at our old clubhouse.

625
00:28:15.893 --> 00:28:17.354
Except oh. wait!

626
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:19.763
You sold it at
our pointless garage sale!

627
00:28:29.104 --> 00:28:31.775
- Hey. this is like
the jar with the jellybeans.

628
00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.844
- Yup. I figured they got it
somewhere inside this mall.

629
00:28:34.879 --> 00:28:36.109
Huh? Huh?

630
00:28:36.144 --> 00:28:37.275
- Now what?

631
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.309
- You'll see!

632
00:28:43.921 --> 00:28:45.855
- Hey. look. we have one
of these back at the clubhouse.

633
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.120
Except-- oh. wait!

634
00:28:47.155 --> 00:28:50.024
You also sold that
at our pointless garage sale!

635
00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:51.586
- Would you just let it go?

636
00:28:51.621 --> 00:28:53.390
Oh. Here we go. Perfect.

637
00:28:53.425 --> 00:28:54.424
Hold that. Thanks.

638
00:28:55.625 --> 00:28:56.591
Hold that.

639
00:28:58.837 --> 00:29:01.101
- So we're gonna put
the jellybeans in the jar?

640
00:29:01.136 --> 00:29:02.399
- Precisely.

641
00:29:02.434 --> 00:29:04.368
- So. you wanna spend
the money we don't have

642
00:29:04.403 --> 00:29:07.206
on jellybeans we can't afford
to fill a jar we don't need

643
00:29:07.241 --> 00:29:08.735
in order to make up
for a garage sale

644
00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.781
that we shouldn't have had
in the first place?

645
00:29:10.816 --> 00:29:12.948
- Hey. you gotta spend money
to make money!

646
00:29:12.983 --> 00:29:14.444
And. uh. Hannah

647
00:29:14.479 --> 00:29:15.786
- What?

648
00:29:15.821 --> 00:29:17.282
- We're gonna need
your math skills.

649
00:29:17.317 --> 00:29:18.745
- For jellybeans?

650
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.583
- For 5.000 dollars
and a summer of sweet.

651
00:29:21.618 --> 00:29:23.090
sweet nothing.

652
00:29:23.125 --> 00:29:24.894
Fine.
Let's crunch the numbers.

653
00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:26.258
- Duck!
I am confident.

654
00:29:26.293 --> 00:29:28.623
I am capable--

655
00:29:28.658 --> 00:29:29.833
- What is she saying?

656
00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:31.263
- They're her
daily affirmations.

657
00:29:31.298 --> 00:29:32.803
She says them constantly.

658
00:29:32.838 --> 00:29:35.102
- I am confident.
I am capable.

659
00:29:35.137 --> 00:29:37.269
I will reach my goal.

660
00:29:37.304 --> 00:29:40.976
- I like condiments.
it's inescapable.

661
00:29:41.011 --> 00:29:43.275
pay the grasshopper's toll?

662
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.013
- Oh. so you read lips now?

663
00:29:57.962 --> 00:29:59.192
- So?

664
00:29:59.227 --> 00:30:00.930
- What?

665
00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:01.931
- What now?

666
00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:03.295
- We count them.

667
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:04.835
- All of them?

668
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:05.968
- Yeah. How did you think
this was gonna work?

669
00:30:06.003 --> 00:30:07.970
- That'll take hours! Days!

670
00:30:08.005 --> 00:30:10.467
- Psh. nah.

671
00:30:10.502 --> 00:30:11.974
Yeah. maybe a day.

672
00:30:12.009 --> 00:30:14.845
- I thought you said we were
gonna need Hannah's math skills!

673
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.341
- Yeah. She's gonna keep count!

674
00:30:16.376 --> 00:30:19.014
- That's just counting!
That's not math!

675
00:30:19.049 --> 00:30:20.708
- Six thousand.
seven hundred and thirty.

676
00:30:20.743 --> 00:30:21.984
- Wow.
- Rain Man?

677
00:30:22.019 --> 00:30:23.051
- Give or take
half of a percent.

678
00:30:23.086 --> 00:30:24.514
I just calculated
the volume of the jar

679
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:27.022
and the volume
of each individual jellybean.

680
00:30:27.057 --> 00:30:28.815
and then I accounted for
the oblong displacement

681
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:30.718
to factor in the empty space
between beans.

682
00:30:30.753 --> 00:30:33.028
It's basic geometry.
You can't argue with it.

683
00:30:33.063 --> 00:30:34.293
- No. you can't!

684
00:30:34.328 --> 00:30:35.998
And you can't argue
with 5.000 big ones either!

685
00:30:36.033 --> 00:30:37.560
See. I told you
we had this made!

686
00:30:37.595 --> 00:30:38.792
- Though I won't give you
full credit

687
00:30:38.827 --> 00:30:40.035
considering you thought
my "math skills"

688
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.564
comprised of only counting.

689
00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:43.874
I will admit
this was a pretty decent plan.

690
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:46.371
- You're welcome.

691
00:30:46.406 --> 00:30:48.472
The very first thing
we're gonna get is a new couch.

692
00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.348
- Excuse me.

693
00:31:03.786 --> 00:31:05.720
Okay.

694
00:31:05.755 --> 00:31:07.755
Is everyone ready to hear
the correct number

695
00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.559
of jellybeans in the jar?

696
00:31:09.594 --> 00:31:12.562
Yes.
- Yes. Okay. Here we go.

697
00:31:12.597 --> 00:31:17.600
And the actual number is 6.721!

698
00:31:18.867 --> 00:31:22.011
- We're within 10 jellybeans!
We have to be the winners!

699
00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:24.013
- And the winner
of the 5.000 dollars.

700
00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:25.916
the person
with the closest guess

701
00:31:25.951 --> 00:31:30.580
to the actual number
of jellybeans. is Emma Gleason!

702
00:31:30.615 --> 00:31:34.419
Whose guess. wow. get this.
was within four jellybeans!

703
00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:40.854
- How?

704
00:31:40.889 --> 00:31:42.064
- But that's impossible!

705
00:31:42.099 --> 00:31:43.725
I accounted for everything.

706
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.936
No one could have made a more
accurate calculation. unless

707
00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:49.137
- Unless she counted
every single bean.

708
00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:53.141
Emma. congrats.

709
00:31:53.176 --> 00:31:54.802
Come on up here.

710
00:31:56.344 --> 00:31:59.609
Wow. This is all yours.

711
00:32:01.349 --> 00:32:02.920
- I don't understand.

712
00:32:22.634 --> 00:32:24.271
So now we're out
800 dollars for the windshield

713
00:32:24.306 --> 00:32:27.241
and 35.50 for the jar
and the jellybeans.

714
00:32:27.276 --> 00:32:29.936
- The plan was
to always count the beans.

715
00:32:29.971 --> 00:32:31.773
I don't know why we didn't
just stick to the plan!

716
00:32:31.808 --> 00:32:33.445
- Hey. calm down. okay?

717
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.941
Counting the beans
would've taken forever!

718
00:32:34.976 --> 00:32:37.020
And Hannah's calculation
was pretty close!

719
00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:38.945
- Yeah.
A fat lot of good it did us.

720
00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.915
And since when do we change
our approach on the fly?

721
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.323
- Curtis!
Literally everything

722
00:32:43.358 --> 00:32:46.029
you've ever come up with
has been on the fly!

723
00:32:46.955 --> 00:32:48.691
- Okay. but I don't see
you and Hannah

724
00:32:48.726 --> 00:32:50.132
coming up with anything!

725
00:32:50.167 --> 00:32:52.332
All you've done is just
shoot down my ideas one by one!

726
00:32:52.367 --> 00:32:53.861
- Hey. Operation Sweet Life

727
00:32:53.896 --> 00:32:54.862
- We're not calling it
that anymore.

728
00:32:54.897 --> 00:32:57.535
- was your big plan!

729
00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.868
- Oh. okay.
So now it's my fault?

730
00:33:00.903 --> 00:33:03.706
It's my fault that you didn't
want to get a summer job?

731
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:06.973
It's my fault that you two
were just gonna give up

732
00:33:07.008 --> 00:33:08.843
your last easy summer?

733
00:33:08.878 --> 00:33:11.714
It's my fault
that I just wanted to spend

734
00:33:11.749 --> 00:33:14.189
some stupid time
with my stupid friends

735
00:33:14.224 --> 00:33:16.554
before the stupid world
sucks all the fun out of us?

736
00:33:16.589 --> 00:33:17.720
Curtis.

737
00:33:17.755 --> 00:33:19.161
- Hey. sit down.

738
00:33:19.196 --> 00:33:20.690
I'm sure there's something
that we can come up with.

739
00:33:20.725 --> 00:33:22.362
The summer's
not even halfway over.

740
00:33:22.397 --> 00:33:25.827
- There's nowhere to sit
because all our stuff is gone.

741
00:33:25.862 --> 00:33:27.334
Dude. I need out.

742
00:33:27.369 --> 00:33:28.863
It's like an oven in here. man.

743
00:33:28.898 --> 00:33:29.831
- Curtis!

744
00:33:33.034 --> 00:33:34.374
- What's gotten into him?

745
00:33:34.409 --> 00:33:35.969
- I don't know.

746
00:33:36.004 --> 00:33:37.212
Okay. I've never heard him
talk like that before.

747
00:33:37.247 --> 00:33:38.675
- I don't know
why he's getting so defensive.

748
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:40.545
- He's doing this for you.
you know.

749
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.712
- You don't think
he's doing it for you?

750
00:33:42.747 --> 00:33:44.912
- For us. maybe.

751
00:33:44.947 --> 00:33:45.979
We can't let him fail.
all right?

752
00:33:46.014 --> 00:33:48.190
We have to keep trying.

753
00:33:48.225 --> 00:33:50.522
- But what if we let this lie
go the entire summer

754
00:33:50.557 --> 00:33:53.723
and at the end. we both still
have empty bank accounts?

755
00:33:53.758 --> 00:33:56.231
There's no way that ends well.

756
00:33:56.266 --> 00:33:58.893
- You know me. I can't tell you
to lie to your parents.

757
00:33:58.928 --> 00:34:01.797
But I could help you
find a real job.

758
00:34:09.114 --> 00:34:12.038
- Maybe if I just tell them
I'm dying.

759
00:34:12.073 --> 00:34:14.744
they'll let me stay in bed
for the rest of the summer.

760
00:35:03.696 --> 00:35:05.927
- Congratulations.

761
00:35:05.962 --> 00:35:07.467
- What's goin' on?

762
00:35:07.502 --> 00:35:10.173
- Your mom. she just scored
two new clients today!

763
00:35:11.869 --> 00:35:13.968
- So. presentations went well?

764
00:35:14.003 --> 00:35:17.147
- And it's all due to
the power of positive thinking.

765
00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:19.611
- Well. yeah.
that and your hard work.

766
00:35:19.646 --> 00:35:24.649
Success: 10 percent inspiration.
90 percent perspiration!

767
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.982
- I now have half the retail
businesses at the mall

768
00:35:28.017 --> 00:35:29.753
as my clients.

769
00:35:29.788 --> 00:35:31.326
So. in addition to
my other clients.

770
00:35:31.361 --> 00:35:34.263
I'm going to be very busy
for the rest of the summer!

771
00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:35.990
- Aren't you already very busy?

772
00:35:36.025 --> 00:35:37.024
- Yeah. Tell me about it!

773
00:35:37.059 --> 00:35:38.861
Between you two
and your new jobs.

774
00:35:38.896 --> 00:35:41.336
I hardly see anyone all day!

775
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:42.865
- I think this little job
at the pool

776
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.208
has been so great for you. Dave.

777
00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:48.035
I see you growing up.

778
00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:50.609
Taking responsibility.

779
00:35:50.644 --> 00:35:52.974
You should come work for me
a few evenings a week.

780
00:35:54.076 --> 00:35:55.977
- Ah. well. hold on. Hold on.

781
00:35:56.012 --> 00:35:57.220
I would never see him!

782
00:35:57.255 --> 00:35:59.981
It'd get kind of
lonely around here.

783
00:36:00.016 --> 00:36:02.049
- Oh. No. please.

784
00:36:02.084 --> 00:36:03.886
- Excuse me?

785
00:36:03.921 --> 00:36:06.020
- Please. I--I--I can't.

786
00:36:06.055 --> 00:36:07.395
- What do you mean?

787
00:36:08.926 --> 00:36:13.929
- Because because I agreed
to work the late shift

788
00:36:14.437 --> 00:36:15.667
at the pool.

789
00:36:15.702 --> 00:36:16.338
It's not on your schedule.

790
00:36:16.373 --> 00:36:17.471
- Just today.

791
00:36:17.506 --> 00:36:19.836
I told them.
so I can't back out now.

792
00:36:19.871 --> 00:36:21.068
I'm really committed!

793
00:36:21.103 --> 00:36:23.345
- I guess you can't.

794
00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.248
- Every evening?

795
00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:27.976
- Well. if you're gonna
do something.

796
00:36:28.011 --> 00:36:29.912
do it all the way.
Right. Dad?

797
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:36.259
- Truer words. Dave.

798
00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:39.526
True er words.

799
00:36:53.036 --> 00:36:54.541
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

800
00:36:54.576 --> 00:36:57.775
I told my mom I'm gonna work
nights at the pool.

801
00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:59.381
So. now. I'm gonna be out
'til 10 pm.

802
00:36:59.416 --> 00:37:00.943
I'm gonna starve to death.

803
00:37:00.978 --> 00:37:02.516
- Extra shifts?

804
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:03.517
That means she's gonna be
expecting more money

805
00:37:03.552 --> 00:37:05.079
at the end of summer. too.

806
00:37:06.115 --> 00:37:07.950
- I didn't even
think about that!

807
00:37:07.985 --> 00:37:10.051
We couldn't even scrape
together five grand.

808
00:37:10.086 --> 00:37:12.229
I'm so toast!

809
00:37:13.463 --> 00:37:14.792
- No worries. pal.

810
00:37:14.827 --> 00:37:17.300
Turns out.
I am your bread and butter.

811
00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:19.027
- What do you mean?

812
00:37:19.062 --> 00:37:20.270
- He was right.

813
00:37:20.305 --> 00:37:22.030
- Ah! Second time
she's said that this summer.

814
00:37:22.065 --> 00:37:23.306
I think she's warming up to me.

815
00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:25.407
- The Chinatown Tunnels
are real.

816
00:37:25.442 --> 00:37:26.771
And I think that's where
Councilman Haft

817
00:37:26.806 --> 00:37:27.805
hid the Labash coins.

818
00:37:29.578 --> 00:37:31.039
- You're kidding.

819
00:37:31.074 --> 00:37:32.612
- I was up all last night
cross-referencing.

820
00:37:32.647 --> 00:37:34.482
There's certainly mention
of historic tunnels

821
00:37:34.517 --> 00:37:35.978
under old Chinatown.

822
00:37:36.013 --> 00:37:37.485
Hints of secret entrances
scattered around.

823
00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.786
It's not obvious. but the traces
are definitely in here.

824
00:37:41.821 --> 00:37:44.624
And. this book belonged to Haft.

825
00:37:44.659 --> 00:37:46.494
It was at his estate sale
where I bought it.

826
00:37:46.529 --> 00:37:47.990
Which means he would have
known about the tunnels

827
00:37:48.025 --> 00:37:49.926
and maybe how to access them.

828
00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:50.927
Would have been
the perfect hiding spot

829
00:37:50.962 --> 00:37:52.258
for his stolen coins.

830
00:37:52.293 --> 00:37:54.436
I mean. this could be
our pay day after all.

831
00:37:54.471 --> 00:37:56.933
- So Operation Sweet Life
lives again.

832
00:37:56.968 --> 00:37:57.934
- Yeah.

833
00:37:57.969 --> 00:37:59.166
- "Pay Day."

834
00:38:02.974 --> 00:38:05.172
It's called
"Project Pay Day."

835
00:38:18.286 --> 00:38:20.253
- Downtown's a lot bigger
than I remember it.

836
00:38:20.288 --> 00:38:22.123
Are we sure we're in
the right neighborhood?

837
00:38:25.799 --> 00:38:27.260
- The tunnels
run under this entire area.

838
00:38:27.295 --> 00:38:28.437
according to the book.

839
00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:29.933
We just have to find
an entrance.

840
00:38:29.968 --> 00:38:30.835
- The book doesn't say
where one is?

841
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.540
- No. it doesn't say.

842
00:38:32.575 --> 00:38:34.036
It wouldn't be a secret
if it did.

843
00:38:34.071 --> 00:38:36.038
Besides. that'll be too easy.

844
00:38:36.073 --> 00:38:37.347
- Too easy?

845
00:38:37.382 --> 00:38:38.612
I don't think
there is such a thing.

846
00:38:45.313 --> 00:38:47.148
- If we recreate
the scene of the crime.

847
00:38:47.183 --> 00:38:49.216
we could find the alleyway
Haft ducked down.

848
00:38:49.251 --> 00:38:51.284
Yo Dave. you pretend to be
a police officer.

849
00:38:51.319 --> 00:38:53.990
and I'll pretend to be Haft
and run from you.

850
00:38:54.025 --> 00:38:55.497
If I channel his thinking--
- Run!

851
00:38:55.532 --> 00:38:57.026
Wait. I haven't started--
- No. really. Run.

852
00:38:57.061 --> 00:38:58.060
It's my mom. Come on.

853
00:39:01.934 --> 00:39:04.231
I need to run.
- In here.

854
00:39:04.266 --> 00:39:05.540
No. the shoplifting
has been focused

855
00:39:05.575 --> 00:39:06.937
entirely around antiques--

856
00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:12.272
Three for lunch?

857
00:39:14.111 --> 00:39:16.012
- Yes. Three for lunch.

858
00:39:25.089 --> 00:39:26.858
Thank you.

859
00:39:26.893 --> 00:39:27.892
- Thanks.

860
00:39:28.895 --> 00:39:29.894
- Thanks.

861
00:39:31.359 --> 00:39:33.568
What are you thinking?
We can't afford this.

862
00:39:33.603 --> 00:39:35.196
- Well. I was thinking
that you need to spend money

863
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:38.672
in order to make money.
Right. Curtis?

864
00:39:38.707 --> 00:39:40.839
You still have the money
from selling fake grades?

865
00:39:40.874 --> 00:39:42.775
- Oh. I completely
forgot about that.

866
00:39:44.372 --> 00:39:45.976
- Yeah.
but what are you thinking?

867
00:39:47.749 --> 00:39:49.045
- That if anyone
must know anything

868
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.046
about these Chinatown Tunnels.

869
00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:51.344
it might be
the Chinese restaurant

870
00:39:51.379 --> 00:39:52.719
right above them.

871
00:39:53.755 --> 00:39:55.018
- You guys know what you want?

872
00:39:55.053 --> 00:39:57.086
- Ah. yes.
Three lunch specials. please.

873
00:39:57.121 --> 00:39:58.692
and some answers.

874
00:39:58.727 --> 00:40:01.090
We're looking for the entrance
to the Chinatown Tunnels.

875
00:40:03.424 --> 00:40:05.600
- I'm so sorry.
- Your father needs you.

876
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.361
I'm so sorry.

877
00:40:08.396 --> 00:40:09.967
My son. he is so clumsy.

878
00:40:10.002 --> 00:40:11.606
- Oh. no.
It-- it was all my fault.

879
00:40:11.641 --> 00:40:13.773
I pulled the glass away
before he could do it.

880
00:40:13.808 --> 00:40:14.906
- Hmm Well.

881
00:40:14.941 --> 00:40:16.237
All right.

882
00:40:16.272 --> 00:40:21.275
Three lunch specials
and what else was there?

883
00:40:22.949 --> 00:40:24.916
- Uh. tea?

884
00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:33.595
- You will find no tunnel
here or elsewhere.

885
00:40:34.796 --> 00:40:38.996
Kindly do not insult us
by inquiring further.

886
00:40:53.683 --> 00:40:55.342
- Ah. Let me.

887
00:41:01.691 --> 00:41:03.449
Um. I'm sorry about before.

888
00:41:03.484 --> 00:41:05.352
I didn't mean to get you
in any trouble.

889
00:41:05.387 --> 00:41:06.958
- Would you like
an extra fortune cookie?

890
00:41:06.993 --> 00:41:08.190
- Oh. no. thanks.

891
00:41:09.963 --> 00:41:11.897
- Go ahead. take it.

892
00:41:14.462 --> 00:41:15.967
- Thanks.

893
00:41:23.471 --> 00:41:24.844
- That lady knows something!

894
00:41:24.879 --> 00:41:27.110
- Yeah. but who's gonna
make her tell us. you?

895
00:41:27.145 --> 00:41:28.848
She was scarier than my mom.

896
00:41:28.883 --> 00:41:31.378
- So. what did I spend
my last 30 bucks for. then?

897
00:41:31.413 --> 00:41:32.918
- For this.

898
00:41:34.251 --> 00:41:35.558
- Aren't you supposed to be
the sensible one

899
00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:36.889
in the band. right?

900
00:41:36.924 --> 00:41:38.319
Like. I'm the cute one.
you're the sensible one.

901
00:41:38.354 --> 00:41:40.123
and then Dave's Ringo.

902
00:41:40.158 --> 00:41:41.564
- He wanted me to have it.

903
00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:43.126
- Looks like Hannah's
the cute one after all.

904
00:41:43.161 --> 00:41:44.501
- Maybe I am.

905
00:41:48.364 --> 00:41:49.902
Look. see.
He wrote something on it.

906
00:41:49.937 --> 00:41:51.541
- Well. what does it say?

907
00:41:51.576 --> 00:41:54.137
- How did he manage to
get it inside the cookie?

908
00:41:54.172 --> 00:41:57.910
- "The entrance to the tunnels
is right in front of your face."

909
00:41:59.375 --> 00:42:00.715
Seems like a dead end.

910
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.310
- Or it's a clue.

911
00:42:02.345 --> 00:42:03.509
"Right in front of your face."

912
00:42:03.544 --> 00:42:04.884
- And how did he get it
out of the cookie

913
00:42:04.919 --> 00:42:06.655
in the first place?

914
00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.382
- Oh. the face on the old clock?

915
00:42:08.417 --> 00:42:10.824
- No. but that's "a" face.
it's not "your" face.

916
00:42:10.859 --> 00:42:12.826
- I wanna know how he got it
out of the cookie

917
00:42:12.861 --> 00:42:14.564
and then back inside again.
- Tweezers!

918
00:42:14.599 --> 00:42:16.192
Would you give it a rest!

919
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.096
- Oh. it's not right
in front of "your face"!

920
00:42:19.131 --> 00:42:21.098
It's "Yuri Pace"!
The town founder!

921
00:42:21.133 --> 00:42:23.034
He just had to write
really fast.

922
00:42:23.069 --> 00:42:24.332
- How would it be Yuri Pace?

923
00:42:24.367 --> 00:42:27.170
Hasn't he been dead
for like a hundred years?

924
00:42:27.205 --> 00:42:29.040
- We passed him on the way here!

925
00:42:43.826 --> 00:42:45.958
- This can't be right.
There's nothing here.

926
00:43:23.965 --> 00:43:26.097
Holy smokes. I was right.

927
00:43:26.132 --> 00:43:27.263
- Hannah was right.

928
00:43:27.298 --> 00:43:29.298
- Curtis was right.

929
00:43:29.333 --> 00:43:30.596
Let's just hope
he was also right

930
00:43:30.631 --> 00:43:33.005
about the stolen coins
being stashed down here.

931
00:43:57.735 --> 00:43:59.493
- Well. which way do we go?

932
00:43:59.528 --> 00:44:01.165
- There's light down that way.

933
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.969
- Looks like the end
of the tunnel.

934
00:44:03.004 --> 00:44:05.708
According to the book. it should
overlook the Greenbelt pier.

935
00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:07.336
- Well. Haft didn't go
that way then.

936
00:44:09.538 --> 00:44:12.011
Keep your eyes peeled
for treasure.

937
00:44:30.592 --> 00:44:33.197
- Somebody painting pottery
down here?

938
00:44:33.232 --> 00:44:34.902
Look!

939
00:44:39.205 --> 00:44:40.600
- Open it.

940
00:44:42.604 --> 00:44:44.010
- I don't believe it.

941
00:44:44.045 --> 00:44:45.572
- If I'm dreaming.
don't wake me up.

942
00:44:45.607 --> 00:44:47.046
- We found it? We're free!

943
00:44:47.081 --> 00:44:48.047
- We're rich!

944
00:44:48.082 --> 00:44:49.444
- We're missing something

945
00:44:50.755 --> 00:44:53.019
these aren't the Labash coins.

946
00:44:53.054 --> 00:44:54.889
What does the map say?

947
00:44:54.924 --> 00:44:56.187
Up this way.

948
00:44:58.521 --> 00:45:00.488
Well. it better be.
'cause I'll kill anyone

949
00:45:00.523 --> 00:45:02.622
who gets between
me and that gold!

950
00:45:05.594 --> 00:45:07.198
What the ?

951
00:45:07.233 --> 00:45:08.969
Who are you?

952
00:45:10.434 --> 00:45:11.906
Who are you?

953
00:45:11.941 --> 00:45:13.600
What are you?

954
00:45:13.635 --> 00:45:16.603
- I am Gangrangle the Elder.
banished from the High Council.

955
00:45:16.638 --> 00:45:18.011
in seek of the Treasure
of Zalmut.

956
00:45:18.046 --> 00:45:20.607
Level 23 Wizard.

957
00:45:20.642 --> 00:45:22.081
- Cosplayers?

958
00:45:22.116 --> 00:45:24.083
- It's LARPers to you.
puny mortal.

959
00:45:24.118 --> 00:45:25.953
- What are you. a level two?

960
00:45:25.988 --> 00:45:28.384
- I'll level you.
you disgraced wand jockey.

961
00:45:28.419 --> 00:45:30.386
- So this gold isn't real?

962
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:31.761
- Look. "real"
is just a concept

963
00:45:31.796 --> 00:45:33.191
society puts on things.

964
00:45:33.226 --> 00:45:35.688
Who's to say what's really real?

965
00:45:35.723 --> 00:45:37.162
- So. it's really not real?

966
00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.034
- So. do you guys play
dress-up down here a lot?

967
00:45:41.069 --> 00:45:42.068
We're LARPers!

968
00:45:42.103 --> 00:45:43.399
- And this is
kind of our territory.

969
00:45:43.434 --> 00:45:45.808
We've been on this quest
for months.

970
00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:47.370
- Months?

971
00:45:47.405 --> 00:45:48.635
- Begone!

972
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:50.912
- Yeah. you're kind of
ruining the climax here.

973
00:45:50.947 --> 00:45:52.441
- So that means

974
00:45:52.476 --> 00:45:53.739
- The coins have probably
already been found.

975
00:45:53.774 --> 00:45:55.785
- Or they were never even here.
to begin with.

976
00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.611
Wait
are you guys LARPing too?

977
00:45:58.823 --> 00:46:00.020
- Narp.

978
00:46:08.965 --> 00:46:10.833
- I just I don't get it.

979
00:46:12.463 --> 00:46:14.969
- Well. try and keep up.

980
00:46:15.004 --> 00:46:16.234
It's halfway through summer.

981
00:46:16.269 --> 00:46:18.940
I'm working a double shift
at a fake job.

982
00:46:18.975 --> 00:46:21.811
and I have
a bank account of zero.

983
00:46:21.846 --> 00:46:23.340
- Yeah.
And we still owe Uncle Mike

984
00:46:23.375 --> 00:46:26.178
that 800 bucks for his car.

985
00:46:26.213 --> 00:46:27.817
- But everything lined up.

986
00:46:27.852 --> 00:46:30.149
All right. it all made sense.
so why didn't we find the coins?

987
00:46:30.184 --> 00:46:32.954
It just it feels strange.

988
00:46:32.989 --> 00:46:34.780
- It feels depressing.

989
00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.057
- It feels itchy.

990
00:46:39.556 --> 00:46:40.995
- It does feel itchy

991
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:44.295
- Yeah. why does it feel itchy?

992
00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:46.231
Curtis. where'd you
get this couch?

993
00:46:47.696 --> 00:46:49.630
Fleas! Oh!

994
00:46:53.009 --> 00:46:54.470
Maybe we can
outrun them!

995
00:46:55.506 --> 00:46:56.846
This way!

996
00:47:14.525 --> 00:47:16.162
Can fleas hold their breath
for long?

997
00:47:16.197 --> 00:47:17.691
Dave?

998
00:47:17.726 --> 00:47:19.726
Aren't you three
supposed to be at work?

999
00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:22.366
Well. when you put it
like that

1000
00:47:24.106 --> 00:47:26.370
it does look sort of bad.

1001
00:47:32.675 --> 00:47:35.643
- I cannot believe you three!

1002
00:47:35.678 --> 00:47:37.546
Especially you. Dave.

1003
00:47:37.581 --> 00:47:39.812
I helped you out
and now I discover that I have

1004
00:47:39.847 --> 00:47:43.057
inadvertently participated
in some grand conspiracy

1005
00:47:43.092 --> 00:47:44.751
to hoodwink your mom.

1006
00:47:44.786 --> 00:47:47.061
I mean. you do realize
she will kill me for this.

1007
00:47:47.096 --> 00:47:49.063
- Right after
she's done killin' me.

1008
00:47:49.098 --> 00:47:51.098
- Ugh. I don't doubt it.

1009
00:47:51.133 --> 00:47:52.396
Jeez. Louise!

1010
00:47:52.431 --> 00:47:54.002
You couldn't just get
normal summer jobs

1011
00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:55.564
like every other teenager
your age?

1012
00:47:55.599 --> 00:47:59.205
- Uncle Brad. Dave isn't like
other teenagers his age.

1013
00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.273
His free time is potentially
very valuable to--

1014
00:48:01.308 --> 00:48:04.012
- Okay. yeah. That's enough
from you. you little sneak.

1015
00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:05.112
I mean. you're the one
who guilted me

1016
00:48:05.147 --> 00:48:06.410
into helping you all
in the first place.

1017
00:48:06.445 --> 00:48:08.082
- Brad! He's a kid.

1018
00:48:08.117 --> 00:48:10.150
It's your own fault
for feeling so guilty!

1019
00:48:13.716 --> 00:48:15.056
- I just don't know
what I'm supposed to do. Dave.

1020
00:48:15.091 --> 00:48:16.618
I mean.
I have to tell your mother.

1021
00:48:16.653 --> 00:48:19.093
And Hannah. aren't you supposed
to have a summer job. too?

1022
00:48:19.128 --> 00:48:21.062
Guys. I'm sorry.
but I think this--

1023
00:48:21.097 --> 00:48:22.888
this little plan of yours
is over.

1024
00:48:24.661 --> 00:48:27.431
- Please. Uncle Brad.
give us one more chance

1025
00:48:27.466 --> 00:48:29.972
to make the money
and pay Uncle Mike back.

1026
00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:32.040
We still have a whole month
before she checks our account!

1027
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:36.473
Yeah. There's no way I could
keep this quiet for a month!

1028
00:48:36.508 --> 00:48:38.475
What? You know my sister!
She gets things out of me!

1029
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.279
There's no way I'd make it.

1030
00:48:40.314 --> 00:48:42.083
- Brad. let's give
them two weeks.

1031
00:48:42.118 --> 00:48:43.447
I mean. we're going to Mexico.

1032
00:48:43.482 --> 00:48:44.382
It's not like
you're gonna see her anyway.

1033
00:48:44.417 --> 00:48:45.647
- We can do it in two weeks!

1034
00:48:45.682 --> 00:48:46.956
Curtis!

1035
00:48:46.991 --> 00:48:48.056
- All right. young man.

1036
00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:50.124
You're so clever.
and so determined.

1037
00:48:50.159 --> 00:48:52.258
What's the big plan
for making all this money?

1038
00:48:52.293 --> 00:48:53.655
- I'll tell you!

1039
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:55.426
The stolen Labash coins

1040
00:48:55.461 --> 00:48:57.791
hidden by the late
Councilman Haft in

1041
00:48:57.826 --> 00:49:00.662
the secret-but-definitely-real
Chinatown Tunnels!

1042
00:49:00.697 --> 00:49:03.467
- How how do you guys
know about those?

1043
00:49:03.502 --> 00:49:06.272
- The tunnels?
They're real. We found them.

1044
00:49:06.307 --> 00:49:07.603
- No. not the tunnels.

1045
00:49:07.638 --> 00:49:08.835
I mean. where did you
learn about the coins

1046
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:10.573
that Mr. Labash had
in his store?

1047
00:49:10.608 --> 00:49:13.444
They were
stolen last year!

1048
00:49:13.479 --> 00:49:15.644
- They were actually stolen
long before that.

1049
00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:19.417
The Labash coins.

1050
00:49:19.452 --> 00:49:21.353
a century before they were
even known by that name.

1051
00:49:21.388 --> 00:49:23.993
were stolen from a local bank
in Old Chinatown

1052
00:49:24.028 --> 00:49:25.918
in the historic section
of the city.

1053
00:49:25.953 --> 00:49:26.820
- How do you know that?

1054
00:49:26.855 --> 00:49:28.459
- Oh. it's legend in my family.

1055
00:49:28.494 --> 00:49:30.362
My mother would tell us
the story often.

1056
00:49:31.728 --> 00:49:33.860
- Well. let's hear it!

1057
00:49:33.895 --> 00:49:37.006
- Well. it all started
in the year 1885.

1058
00:49:37.041 --> 00:49:39.503
That was the year that they ran
every single Chinese resident

1059
00:49:39.538 --> 00:49:40.966
out of town.

1060
00:49:41.001 --> 00:49:42.044
They had brought
the Chinese migrants here

1061
00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.474
for cheap labor.

1062
00:49:43.509 --> 00:49:45.377
But before long. the locals
began to turn against them.

1063
00:49:45.412 --> 00:49:46.708
Began to blame
the Chinese immigrants

1064
00:49:46.743 --> 00:49:48.908
for everything that was
going wrong in the city.

1065
00:49:50.714 --> 00:49:52.813
I guess some things
never change.

1066
00:49:52.848 --> 00:49:55.156
But. that's not the whole story.

1067
00:49:55.191 --> 00:49:57.554
City officials told the Chinese
that they had one week

1068
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:58.555
to leave town.

1069
00:49:58.590 --> 00:49:59.721
But these were their homes.

1070
00:49:59.756 --> 00:50:01.228
and they had
no place else to go.

1071
00:50:01.263 --> 00:50:03.494
When the locals found out that
the Chinese were resisting.

1072
00:50:03.529 --> 00:50:05.958
things got more and more tense.

1073
00:50:05.993 --> 00:50:08.961
All over town.
riots began to break out.

1074
00:50:08.996 --> 00:50:11.832
And as always happens.
looters began to take advantage

1075
00:50:11.867 --> 00:50:13.372
of the chaos.

1076
00:50:13.407 --> 00:50:15.000
The payroll was stolen.

1077
00:50:15.035 --> 00:50:17.343
And the locals tried to blame
the Chinese for the robbery.

1078
00:50:18.907 --> 00:50:23.745
But my great-great grandmother.
a woman named Lei-Lei Tang.

1079
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.582
she knew better.

1080
00:50:25.617 --> 00:50:27.386
She was a renowned gardener.

1081
00:50:27.421 --> 00:50:28.981
and she'd been hired
by some of the locals

1082
00:50:29.016 --> 00:50:30.983
to tend to their flowers.

1083
00:50:31.018 --> 00:50:32.391
And as she was
going about her duties

1084
00:50:32.426 --> 00:50:34.162
during of all the unrest.

1085
00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:35.724
she happened to overhear
the people

1086
00:50:35.759 --> 00:50:38.100
who had actually
committed the robbery.

1087
00:50:38.135 --> 00:50:42.027
She saw what the men had
stolen. Dozens of gold coins.

1088
00:50:42.062 --> 00:50:44.931
each imprinted
with a distinctive seal.

1089
00:50:44.966 --> 00:50:47.901
- So. the coins are real!

1090
00:50:47.936 --> 00:50:50.409
- And Mr. Labash must have
gotten them from his ancestors.

1091
00:50:50.444 --> 00:50:52.114
those bank robbers?

1092
00:50:52.149 --> 00:50:54.710
- Or bought them from
whoever did inherit them!

1093
00:50:54.745 --> 00:50:56.184
- Perhaps you know.

1094
00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:57.944
the Chinese History Museum
tried to purchase those coins

1095
00:50:57.979 --> 00:51:00.518
from Mr. Labash several times
before their disappearance.

1096
00:51:00.553 --> 00:51:02.883
They said those old coins
were part of

1097
00:51:02.918 --> 00:51:04.093
Chinese-American history.

1098
00:51:04.128 --> 00:51:05.589
The history of this city.

1099
00:51:05.624 --> 00:51:07.426
But Mr. Labash always refused.

1100
00:51:07.461 --> 00:51:10.957
The museum could never afford to
pay the real value of the coins.

1101
00:51:12.136 --> 00:51:14.026
But

1102
00:51:14.061 --> 00:51:15.401
What?

1103
00:51:15.436 --> 00:51:17.931
- My mother always told
an extra piece of the story.

1104
00:51:17.966 --> 00:51:20.307
I mean. who knows
whether it's true or not

1105
00:51:20.342 --> 00:51:21.935
- Michael

1106
00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:24.311
But my mother
told me the men got distracted.

1107
00:51:24.346 --> 00:51:26.478
and Nana Lei-Lei
had a chance to steal

1108
00:51:26.513 --> 00:51:29.074
some of those gold coins back.

1109
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:30.944
Lei-Lei was planning on
returning those coins

1110
00:51:30.979 --> 00:51:33.254
to the bank.
but before she could.

1111
00:51:33.289 --> 00:51:34.915
Chinatown was burning.

1112
00:51:36.083 --> 00:51:38.050
She tried to run
to warn her family.

1113
00:51:38.085 --> 00:51:40.954
and somewhere along the way.
she hid those coins.

1114
00:51:40.989 --> 00:51:42.725
But it was too late.

1115
00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.431
They rounded up
all of the Chinese immigrants.

1116
00:51:45.466 --> 00:51:46.729
Lei-Lei tried to tell them

1117
00:51:46.764 --> 00:51:47.763
she knew
where the stolen money was.

1118
00:51:47.798 --> 00:51:49.138
but nobody would listen to her.

1119
00:51:51.604 --> 00:51:54.066
- Did Lei-Lei ever come back
for the coins?

1120
00:51:54.101 --> 00:51:55.804
Well. she
tried to. but by that time.

1121
00:51:55.839 --> 00:51:59.005
the city had sunk the wreckage
of Chinatown into the bay.

1122
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.381
An attempt to erase this
chapter from their history.

1123
00:52:02.813 --> 00:52:04.010
But it wasn't erased.

1124
00:52:04.045 --> 00:52:06.012
Because Lei-Lei
told her daughter.

1125
00:52:06.047 --> 00:52:07.981
And her daughter
told my grandmother.

1126
00:52:08.016 --> 00:52:09.851
And my grandmother
told my mother.

1127
00:52:09.886 --> 00:52:12.194
And she told me.

1128
00:52:13.956 --> 00:52:16.330
- So. maybe Labash
didn't have all the coins!

1129
00:52:16.365 --> 00:52:18.926
Maybe they were never
in the tunnel at all.

1130
00:52:18.961 --> 00:52:21.093
- Wait. guys. I'm lost.

1131
00:52:21.128 --> 00:52:22.468
- Don't you get it?

1132
00:52:22.503 --> 00:52:24.338
If Lei-Lei stole the coins
and hid them.

1133
00:52:24.373 --> 00:52:26.032
the coins are in Old Chinatown!

1134
00:52:26.067 --> 00:52:27.308
We were looking
in the wrong place!

1135
00:52:27.343 --> 00:52:29.442
- But isn't Old Chinatown

1136
00:52:29.477 --> 00:52:31.213
Underwater?

1137
00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:32.247
- The bay.

1138
00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.381
Thank you!
- Yeah.

1139
00:52:34.416 --> 00:52:35.943
Uh. Thanks. Uncle Brad!

1140
00:52:35.978 --> 00:52:37.681
- What--? What did I do?

1141
00:52:37.716 --> 00:52:38.946
We'll see you
in two weeks!

1142
00:52:38.981 --> 00:52:40.255
We're gonna get those coins!

1143
00:52:41.258 --> 00:52:42.785
- Oh

1144
00:53:16.887 --> 00:53:18.227
- Hello. Mister.

1145
00:53:18.262 --> 00:53:21.494
Before you say anything.
have we got a deal for you!

1146
00:53:21.529 --> 00:53:24.662
We know for a fact there's
a 100 percent real treasure

1147
00:53:24.697 --> 00:53:26.532
located at the bottom
of the bay.

1148
00:53:26.567 --> 00:53:28.336
And if you equip us
for the dive.

1149
00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:30.998
we'll cut you in five
percent. No questions asked.

1150
00:53:31.033 --> 00:53:33.033
- I got a question.

1151
00:53:33.068 --> 00:53:34.199
How old are you?

1152
00:53:34.234 --> 00:53:36.509
And you know.
there's a better question.

1153
00:53:36.544 --> 00:53:37.939
How broke are you?

1154
00:53:37.974 --> 00:53:39.248
- We're 15.
- We're 18.

1155
00:53:39.283 --> 00:53:40.876
- And let's just
say all our funds

1156
00:53:40.911 --> 00:53:43.285
are tied up in
this particular venture!

1157
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.881
These are genuine gold coins
from the 1850s

1158
00:53:45.916 --> 00:53:46.915
we're talking about.

1159
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:48.521
Guaranteed to fetch
a handsome price.

1160
00:53:48.556 --> 00:53:49.885
- Well. only if
we can find them.

1161
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.525
- Just imagine
a whole lot of dough.

1162
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.186
And five percent in your pocket.

1163
00:53:54.221 --> 00:53:56.056
- Treasure hunters. huh?

1164
00:53:57.257 --> 00:53:59.466
- So? What do you say?

1165
00:54:08.741 --> 00:54:10.070
- I've got a counter-offer.

1166
00:54:11.315 --> 00:54:12.974
You three come down here
and work for me on the dock

1167
00:54:13.009 --> 00:54:15.977
in exchange for the use
of the dive equipment.

1168
00:54:16.012 --> 00:54:18.947
Let's say
a day's work for a day diving.

1169
00:54:21.754 --> 00:54:24.260
- Could I interest you
in a 10 percent cut?

1170
00:54:45.448 --> 00:54:46.843
-It's my mom!

1171
00:54:46.878 --> 00:54:48.350
Get in the boat.
-  --so much for

1172
00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:50.616
meeting with me. Megan.

1173
00:54:50.651 --> 00:54:53.355
Have you ever considered
opening an outlet version

1174
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:54.983
of the Dive Shop?

1175
00:54:55.018 --> 00:54:58.855
There is a terrific space just
opening up at the Bayside Mall!

1176
00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:00.087
- How does she keep
showing up like that?

1177
00:55:00.122 --> 00:55:01.924
- She's everywhere.

1178
00:55:01.959 --> 00:55:03.596
- I think your mom's Batman.

1179
00:55:13.641 --> 00:55:14.838
- Man. I hope that's everything.

1180
00:55:21.044 --> 00:55:24.276
- Okay. That's one day's work.

1181
00:55:24.311 --> 00:55:25.816
- All right.

1182
00:55:25.851 --> 00:55:26.850
You guys come back
tomorrow morning

1183
00:55:26.885 --> 00:55:28.654
and we'll get you outfitted.

1184
00:55:28.689 --> 00:55:30.150
Just remember
to bring your dive certs.

1185
00:55:30.185 --> 00:55:32.988
and a major credit card
for the deposit.

1186
00:55:33.023 --> 00:55:34.825
- Credit card?
We don't have credit cards!

1187
00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.255
Deposit?

1188
00:55:38.996 --> 00:55:41.062
I'm just
kidding with you!

1189
00:55:41.097 --> 00:55:43.900
You guys leave your student IDs.
and we'll call it a deal.

1190
00:55:43.935 --> 00:55:45.605
Go on. Get outta here.

1191
00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.739
- Thanks.

1192
00:56:15.736 --> 00:56:18.506
- So this is where
they sunk old Chinatown?

1193
00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:20.002
- Amazing. isn't it?

1194
00:56:20.037 --> 00:56:22.873
- All right.
Let's find some stolen coins!

1195
00:56:24.206 --> 00:56:26.107
- It is bigger than
I thought it would be.

1196
00:56:26.142 --> 00:56:29.847
- Well. they did sink a whole
neighborhood into it. so.

1197
00:56:31.983 --> 00:56:33.081
- I'm just thinking

1198
00:56:33.116 --> 00:56:34.522
do you really think
we can find the coins

1199
00:56:34.557 --> 00:56:36.216
before your uncles
get back from Mexico?

1200
00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:37.888
This is a lot of ground
to cover.

1201
00:56:37.923 --> 00:56:39.527
We've got two
whole weeks to look!

1202
00:56:39.562 --> 00:56:40.693
That's like forever!

1203
00:56:40.728 --> 00:56:42.057
- Well. one week. technically.

1204
00:56:43.764 --> 00:56:45.390
Because we'll have to work
another day at the docks

1205
00:56:45.425 --> 00:56:46.732
in order to dive again.

1206
00:56:46.767 --> 00:56:48.195
And the same thing
two days after that.

1207
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:51.264
- Fellas! Look. let's focus on
the positive here. yeah?

1208
00:56:51.299 --> 00:56:53.607
We know exactly where
the coins are for sure!

1209
00:56:53.642 --> 00:56:54.806
It's like basically
all the work.

1210
00:56:54.841 --> 00:56:56.203
Now we just gotta find them!

1211
00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.980
- We've done crazier things
before. Hannah.

1212
00:57:10.351 --> 00:57:11.757
- I'm not too sure

1213
00:57:21.868 --> 00:57:22.933
Anything?

1214
00:57:22.968 --> 00:57:24.066
Nothing.

1215
00:57:24.101 --> 00:57:25.232
It's got to
be here somewhere.

1216
00:57:25.267 --> 00:57:26.266
Let's keep looking!

1217
00:57:41.855 --> 00:57:43.690
Nothing.

1218
00:57:43.725 --> 00:57:45.692
And I think we looked
here already anyway.

1219
00:57:45.727 --> 00:57:46.990
- Then we need to keep looking.

1220
00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.157
- Well. I'm out of air.

1221
00:57:49.192 --> 00:57:51.093
Well. don't
breathe so much!

1222
00:57:51.128 --> 00:57:52.765
And we'll just
come back tomorrow.

1223
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.701
- You mean.
the day after tomorrow.

1224
00:57:54.736 --> 00:57:56.263
Because we need to
work another day.

1225
00:57:56.298 --> 00:57:57.968
- Guys. this is going to work.

1226
00:57:58.003 --> 00:57:59.871
All right? I promise.
Just keep faith!

1227
00:58:02.073 --> 00:58:03.072
What?

1228
00:58:04.141 --> 00:58:05.470
- I don't think we can do this.

1229
00:58:05.505 --> 00:58:06.977
- Well. not with that attitude!

1230
00:58:07.012 --> 00:58:08.979
And what other choice
do we have?

1231
00:58:09.014 --> 00:58:10.475
I'm telling you. it's here.

1232
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:12.015
It's too good not to be true!

1233
00:58:13.084 --> 00:58:14.479
- But we can't have been
the only people

1234
00:58:14.514 --> 00:58:15.524
to have ever dived here.

1235
00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:18.021
- Hannah. he's right.

1236
00:58:18.056 --> 00:58:19.385
As long as we follow the plan

1237
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.992
there's no way
we won't find them.

1238
00:58:42.542 --> 00:58:44.014
- Hey. buck up. guys!

1239
00:58:44.049 --> 00:58:45.345
You think Pizarro

1240
00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:47.688
found the golden city
of El Dorado in a day?

1241
00:58:47.723 --> 00:58:49.855
Or Ponce de Leon
and the Fountain of Youth?

1242
00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:51.824
- Pizarro never found El Dorado.

1243
00:58:51.859 --> 00:58:54.057
And Ponce de Leon didn't find
the Fountain of Youth either.

1244
00:58:56.061 --> 00:58:58.567
My bad.

1245
00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:01.636
- My name's Hannah.
and I know everything.

1246
00:59:38.642 --> 00:59:39.806
Anything?

1247
00:59:40.941 --> 00:59:42.237
Just a whole
lot of these.

1248
00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:46.076
Man.

1249
00:59:59.927 --> 01:00:01.762
- You know. I thought the whole
point of Project Pay Day

1250
01:00:01.797 --> 01:00:04.589
was that we didn't have to
spend the whole summer working.

1251
01:00:04.624 --> 01:00:07.427
- Look. it's not about
not working anymore. Hannah.

1252
01:00:07.462 --> 01:00:11.002
It's about literally surviving
the summer and my mom.

1253
01:00:11.037 --> 01:00:13.235
So. please.
just concentrate on

1254
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:16.843
where we're gonna search
tomorrow. okay?

1255
01:00:16.878 --> 01:00:18.471
- I think we should
just come clean.

1256
01:00:18.506 --> 01:00:20.077
Hey!
Don't talk like that.

1257
01:00:20.112 --> 01:00:21.815
Or you're gonna ruin our mojo.

1258
01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:23.817
I'm telling you.
we're closing in.

1259
01:00:23.852 --> 01:00:25.951
Let's just finish up here.

1260
01:00:25.986 --> 01:00:28.151
get a good night's sleep
and then tomorrow's our day.

1261
01:00:28.186 --> 01:00:29.988
Right? It's gotta be.

1262
01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:32.859
All right? Come on.

1263
01:00:38.966 --> 01:00:40.196
Your power words for today.

1264
01:00:40.231 --> 01:00:43.771
Authenticity.
Transparency. Honesty.

1265
01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.333
And repeat your--

1266
01:00:45.368 --> 01:00:46.873
- Is that the only
bathing suit you have?

1267
01:00:46.908 --> 01:00:49.975
What? I love this suit!

1268
01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:51.878
Come on. If a big-time
lifeguard like Dave

1269
01:00:51.913 --> 01:00:53.506
gets embarrassed
because his old man

1270
01:00:53.541 --> 01:00:54.881
is wearing a suit like this.

1271
01:00:54.916 --> 01:00:56.949
he's got bigger problems.

1272
01:00:56.984 --> 01:00:58.049
Mm.

1273
01:00:58.084 --> 01:00:59.886
I wish I could go with you. but

1274
01:00:59.921 --> 01:01:01.789
with two new clients
having promotions this week.

1275
01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:03.153
I am swamped!

1276
01:01:03.188 --> 01:01:05.892
Ah. that's okay.
I totally understand.

1277
01:01:05.927 --> 01:01:07.894
I was thinking about
going this evening anyway.

1278
01:01:07.929 --> 01:01:10.358
You know. I mean. he's got
his usual double shift.

1279
01:01:10.393 --> 01:01:13.867
plus I'm thinking. eh.
less crowded in the evenings.

1280
01:01:16.872 --> 01:01:18.333
You think he'll be surprised?

1281
01:01:19.908 --> 01:01:21.402
Nothing seems to faze that kid!

1282
01:01:22.944 --> 01:01:24.504
- Come on. Curtis. pick up!

1283
01:01:24.539 --> 01:01:25.813
- Yo. Davy.

1284
01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:27.177
- Dude. emergency. emergency!
I need help!

1285
01:01:27.212 --> 01:01:28.376
Mayday! Now!

1286
01:01:28.411 --> 01:01:29.850
- What? What's going on?

1287
01:01:29.885 --> 01:01:31.478
- Dude. my dad's on his way
to the pool!

1288
01:01:31.513 --> 01:01:32.919
- Is the pool even
open this late?

1289
01:01:32.954 --> 01:01:34.987
- Yeah. it is! And I'm supposed
to be working there!!

1290
01:01:35.022 --> 01:01:37.385
- Oh. Ohhhhhh!

1291
01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.826
Okay. I'm on it. dude.

1292
01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.685
Get there as quickly as you can
and play lifeguard.

1293
01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.896
- Dude. everyone knows
I don't work there.

1294
01:01:42.931 --> 01:01:44.898
- Just for ten minutes!
Pretend for ten minutes.

1295
01:01:44.933 --> 01:01:46.834
And I promise
I'll get you out of there.

1296
01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:47.868
All right. go!

1297
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:55.744
- Dave?

1298
01:01:55.779 --> 01:01:57.240
- You need to get
to the pool right now.

1299
01:01:57.275 --> 01:01:59.044
Dave's dad is on his way there
and you need to delay him.

1300
01:01:59.079 --> 01:02:00.441
Give Dave time to get in.

1301
01:02:00.476 --> 01:02:02.575
- No. No. Curtis.
You know I can't lie to adults.

1302
01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:05.380
Dave needs us.
Hannah. He needs you.

1303
01:02:05.415 --> 01:02:06.953
I need you. To go do this.

1304
01:02:06.988 --> 01:02:08.284
Otherwise. Dave's dead!

1305
01:02:08.319 --> 01:02:09.890
- Why can't you do it?

1306
01:02:09.925 --> 01:02:11.925
- I'll be right behind you.
I just need to grab some things.

1307
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.992
Please. Hannah!

1308
01:02:14.655 --> 01:02:15.687
All right. go.

1309
01:02:35.742 --> 01:02:37.610
Hello. sir.
-  Hi.

1310
01:02:37.645 --> 01:02:39.986
I will take one ticket
for an evening swim.

1311
01:02:42.958 --> 01:02:44.155
Thank you. sir.

1312
01:02:46.027 --> 01:02:46.927
Hey.

1313
01:02:49.756 --> 01:02:50.931
Just one.

1314
01:02:52.198 --> 01:02:53.725
Cool. Thanks. man.

1315
01:03:21.788 --> 01:03:23.293
- Um. hey. Mr. Lucas.

1316
01:03:23.328 --> 01:03:24.756
- Whoa. Hey. Hannah.

1317
01:03:24.791 --> 01:03:26.659
What--what are you doing here?

1318
01:03:26.694 --> 01:03:29.332
- Oh. Well. uh.
um. I--

1319
01:03:29.367 --> 01:03:31.664
I'm meeting. uh. Curtis here
in a little bit.

1320
01:03:31.699 --> 01:03:33.941
- Are you guys
visiting Dave. too?

1321
01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.041
- Yeah.

1322
01:03:35.076 --> 01:03:36.273
- I tell you what.

1323
01:03:36.308 --> 01:03:37.505
there is nothing like
an evening at the pool

1324
01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.012
after a hard day's work. right?

1325
01:03:39.047 --> 01:03:41.278
- Yeah. yeah.
You can say that again. sir!

1326
01:03:41.313 --> 01:03:43.511
- So. how is your
summer job going?

1327
01:03:43.546 --> 01:03:46.855
You're uh Dave told me
you're at the country club?

1328
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.516
N-No

1329
01:03:48.551 --> 01:03:50.023
no. I'm not at--
- Oh. maybe he meant Curtis.

1330
01:03:50.058 --> 01:03:51.288
Maybe Curtis does that.

1331
01:03:51.323 --> 01:03:52.652
which makes sense
because he's so charming.

1332
01:03:52.687 --> 01:03:55.127
He could just charm the pants
right off those

1333
01:03:55.162 --> 01:03:57.624
tennis players.
- I--

1334
01:03:57.659 --> 01:04:01.034
- Is everything okay? You seem
a little a little shaky.

1335
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:04.004
- Uh. No. I am. I am

1336
01:04:04.039 --> 01:04:05.698
- Is everything okay
with your summer job?

1337
01:04:05.733 --> 01:04:07.337
Well. well

1338
01:04:07.372 --> 01:04:08.976
- You can tell me. It's okay.

1339
01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:13.508
- Well. the truth is--is.
um. well. it's been hard

1340
01:04:13.543 --> 01:04:14.883
working at the library.

1341
01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:17.182
It's just--it's so quiet.
I get--I get so lonely.

1342
01:04:17.217 --> 01:04:18.183
Yeah.
- Well. that makes sense.

1343
01:04:18.218 --> 01:04:19.646
I can understand that.

1344
01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:20.922
I'm just so glad
that your good work ethic

1345
01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:22.418
is rubbing off on Dave.

1346
01:04:22.453 --> 01:04:24.024
Because. as I always say.

1347
01:04:24.059 --> 01:04:27.423
"Friends: Great to have them
to rely on."

1348
01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:29.062
- I--I sure hope so. sir.

1349
01:04:29.097 --> 01:04:30.855
- Well. I am anxious
to catch a glimpse

1350
01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:33.561
of lifeguard Dave in action!

1351
01:04:33.596 --> 01:04:35.596
So. I will catch you around?

1352
01:04:35.631 --> 01:04:37.004
- Okay.

1353
01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.566
- Have you ever seen
my cannonball?

1354
01:04:38.601 --> 01:04:39.908
You're in for a treat.

1355
01:05:17.904 --> 01:05:20.575
You have got
a pretty crack team here.

1356
01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:21.950
Oh. we get
the job done.

1357
01:05:24.284 --> 01:05:26.416
- That's my son over there.

1358
01:05:26.451 --> 01:05:27.582
Cool.

1359
01:05:30.488 --> 01:05:32.917
- I lost my goggles.

1360
01:05:32.952 --> 01:05:34.853
- Good. Go over there. okay?

1361
01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:41.464
- You'll uh keep an eye
on him for me. won't you?

1362
01:05:41.499 --> 01:05:43.037
- Not a strong swimmer
or something?

1363
01:05:45.272 --> 01:05:47.041
- Well. you would know
better than me.

1364
01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:49.505
- Oh. he's a regular?

1365
01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.979
- Well. you know.
I'm his father.

1366
01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:53.905
so I wouldn't call him
just regular.

1367
01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.742
But this is his first summer
working on his own.

1368
01:05:55.777 --> 01:05:57.810
and I'm sure he's like
a lot of other teenagers

1369
01:05:57.845 --> 01:05:58.943
who are taking on
responsibility--

1370
01:05:58.978 --> 01:06:00.318
No splashing.

1371
01:06:00.353 --> 01:06:02.353
- Oh. splashing.
Yeah. There you go.

1372
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.587
Eyes like a hawk.

1373
01:06:05.622 --> 01:06:07.886
- You just--just
gotta move away.

1374
01:06:10.231 --> 01:06:12.693
Yeah.
But working with guys like you.

1375
01:06:12.728 --> 01:06:14.530
I'm hoping he picks up
on some of that.

1376
01:06:16.501 --> 01:06:17.929
Ya know

1377
01:06:17.964 --> 01:06:18.974
discipline stuff.

1378
01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:23.044
- Wait a minute

1379
01:06:24.905 --> 01:06:26.344
Working with guys like me?

1380
01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:30.084
- Well. uh. yeah.

1381
01:06:31.582 --> 01:06:34.022
- Which one did you say
your son was?

1382
01:06:34.057 --> 01:06:35.155
- Well. he's. uh--

1383
01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:37.850
- That's lightning!

1384
01:06:38.985 --> 01:06:39.885
Let's go. folks. Let's go.

1385
01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.722
Out of the pool.
Out of the pool.

1386
01:06:41.757 --> 01:06:43.196
Let's go. folks. Let's go!

1387
01:06:43.231 --> 01:06:44.989
-Come
on. I'm saving you.

1388
01:06:45.024 --> 01:06:46.397
Sorry about your goggles.

1389
01:06:57.344 --> 01:06:58.310
Whoo.

1390
01:06:58.345 --> 01:07:00.004
- Yeah. That was close.

1391
01:07:00.039 --> 01:07:01.379
Where have you been?

1392
01:07:01.414 --> 01:07:02.875
If it wasn't for that lightning.
I would've been toast!

1393
01:07:10.423 --> 01:07:11.983
You're a genius.

1394
01:07:13.294 --> 01:07:15.261
Where's Hannah?

1395
01:07:15.296 --> 01:07:18.066
- Uh. I don't know.

1396
01:07:27.539 --> 01:07:30.243
- Hey!
Pretty cool plan. right?

1397
01:07:30.278 --> 01:07:31.937
I can't believe it worked.

1398
01:07:31.972 --> 01:07:33.279
- I can't believe
you made me do that.

1399
01:07:33.314 --> 01:07:35.743
I had to lie to your dad.
Straight to his face.

1400
01:07:35.778 --> 01:07:37.745
- I made you do that?

1401
01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.845
It was Curtis's idea.

1402
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.088
- Look. I don't lie. Dave!

1403
01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:41.254
All right. and your stupid plan

1404
01:07:41.289 --> 01:07:43.223
it's making me act like
someone I'm not!

1405
01:07:43.258 --> 01:07:45.951
- Whoa. slow down. My plan?

1406
01:07:45.986 --> 01:07:48.019
Who's the genius who came up
with Project Pay Day

1407
01:07:48.054 --> 01:07:49.526
in the first place?

1408
01:07:49.561 --> 01:07:51.132
'Cause if there's anyone you
should be yelling at. it's him!

1409
01:07:52.993 --> 01:07:54.597
Yeah. Hannah.

1410
01:07:54.632 --> 01:07:55.664
Why don't you yell at him?

1411
01:07:58.097 --> 01:07:59.701
- Look. Curtis. I'm done.

1412
01:07:59.736 --> 01:08:01.065
All right?
I'm just gonna get a job.

1413
01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.737
It's what I should've done
from the beginning.

1414
01:08:02.772 --> 01:08:04.035
I won't turn you guys in.

1415
01:08:04.070 --> 01:08:06.345
But if anyone asks.
I won't lie for you again.

1416
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:10.382
You know what? I trusted you.

1417
01:08:10.417 --> 01:08:11.845
And you took advantage of that.

1418
01:08:17.787 --> 01:08:19.127
- Dude.

1419
01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:21.756
- So this is all my fault?
You actually think that?

1420
01:08:21.791 --> 01:08:23.164
- Yeah. You made her lie.

1421
01:08:23.199 --> 01:08:24.924
- Yeah. For you. Dave.

1422
01:08:24.959 --> 01:08:26.761
Because your dad
was about to find you out.

1423
01:08:26.796 --> 01:08:28.059
- That's not my fault!

1424
01:08:28.094 --> 01:08:29.236
You're the only reason
there's something to be

1425
01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:30.930
found out in the first place!

1426
01:08:30.965 --> 01:08:33.504
- Why can't you take
any responsibility here?

1427
01:08:33.539 --> 01:08:35.066
Why does it have to all be me?

1428
01:09:17.814 --> 01:09:19.781
- There's my big man! I was
looking for you at the pool.

1429
01:09:19.816 --> 01:09:21.948
I was gonna drive you
for some ice cream!

1430
01:09:21.983 --> 01:09:25.391
But looks like the ice cream
just drove to you!

1431
01:09:25.426 --> 01:09:27.360
- Thanks. I'm not hungry.

1432
01:09:27.395 --> 01:09:29.725
- What? Really?

1433
01:09:31.025 --> 01:09:33.993
Okay. Well. I guess
it's two for me then.

1434
01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.736
You know what. son?

1435
01:09:40.771 --> 01:09:42.474
I'm proud of you.

1436
01:09:42.509 --> 01:09:44.245
Seeing you at the pool.

1437
01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:48.480
All those people putting
their lives in your hands.

1438
01:09:48.515 --> 01:09:50.218
It's a hell of lot of
responsibility.

1439
01:09:50.253 --> 01:09:52.484
And you're taking
good care of 'em.

1440
01:09:52.519 --> 01:09:53.881
I really admire that.

1441
01:09:55.016 --> 01:09:56.521
You're doing good work.

1442
01:09:57.524 --> 01:09:58.523
What if I'm not?

1443
01:10:00.791 --> 01:10:02.989
What if I've never
taken any responsibility

1444
01:10:03.024 --> 01:10:06.058
for anything in my entire life?

1445
01:10:06.093 --> 01:10:09.567
What if I told you
that I'm not a

1446
01:10:09.602 --> 01:10:11.767
who you think I am.

1447
01:10:11.802 --> 01:10:14.770
That I'm not doing
what you think I'm doing.

1448
01:10:18.479 --> 01:10:21.513
- Okay. You listen to me.
All right?

1449
01:10:21.548 --> 01:10:23.042
I'm gonna say this once.

1450
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:27.552
It doesn't matter
what you've done.

1451
01:10:27.587 --> 01:10:30.885
or what you haven't done

1452
01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:33.217
I will always love you.

1453
01:10:33.252 --> 01:10:34.559
Okay?

1454
01:10:34.594 --> 01:10:36.462
Now. your mother.
on the other hand

1455
01:10:38.158 --> 01:10:40.268
No. I'm kidding. seriously.

1456
01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:42.633
You know. everybody
makes mistakes.

1457
01:10:42.668 --> 01:10:43.766
Some people lie.

1458
01:10:43.801 --> 01:10:46.065
Some people get away with it.

1459
01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.639
And other people don't want to.

1460
01:10:48.674 --> 01:10:50.608
Those people.
they own their mistakes.

1461
01:10:50.643 --> 01:10:53.908
and they take responsibility.
and they make them right.

1462
01:10:53.943 --> 01:10:56.108
You just remember that.

1463
01:10:56.143 --> 01:10:58.913
What has happened in the past
isn't nearly as important

1464
01:10:58.948 --> 01:11:00.112
as what you do next.

1465
01:11:01.181 --> 01:11:02.983
What a load of crap!

1466
01:11:06.186 --> 01:11:07.922
More shoplifting!

1467
01:11:07.957 --> 01:11:10.155
This guy is lifting stuff
left and right.

1468
01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:12.333
and ruining the reputation
of the mall.

1469
01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:14.830
And no one's doing
anything serious about it!

1470
01:11:14.865 --> 01:11:17.162
They put up a reward!

1471
01:11:17.197 --> 01:11:18.636
A reward!

1472
01:11:18.671 --> 01:11:20.231
Isn't that the silliest thing
you have ever heard?

1473
01:11:20.266 --> 01:11:22.772
As if 5.000 dollars
is going to convince

1474
01:11:22.807 --> 01:11:26.204
some random vigilante
to track this guy down.

1475
01:11:27.779 --> 01:11:30.582
Oh. I just wish that someone
would take some responsibility

1476
01:11:30.617 --> 01:11:32.617
and belly up
and resolve this thing!

1477
01:11:35.215 --> 01:11:36.390
Anyway. how was the pool?

1478
01:11:53.739 --> 01:11:54.870
Hey.

1479
01:11:56.379 --> 01:11:57.972
Thought
you weren't coming.

1480
01:11:58.007 --> 01:11:59.138
Is Hannah here?

1481
01:12:03.078 --> 01:12:05.012
- Nah. thought she was with you.

1482
01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:09.049
- Curtis. I don't think
we're gonna find anything here.

1483
01:12:09.084 --> 01:12:12.019
I think the best thing to do
is to stop and--

1484
01:12:12.054 --> 01:12:13.086
- BOOM.

1485
01:12:14.892 --> 01:12:15.990
- Uh

1486
01:12:16.025 --> 01:12:18.058
- Found him this morning.

1487
01:12:18.093 --> 01:12:19.961
- But don't

1488
01:12:19.996 --> 01:12:22.370
we have--
- That isn't Mr. Moneybags.

1489
01:12:22.405 --> 01:12:24.196
It's one exactly like him
that I found

1490
01:12:24.231 --> 01:12:26.539
right at the bottom
right over there.

1491
01:12:26.574 --> 01:12:28.739
So. don't say we're not
gonna find anything.

1492
01:12:28.774 --> 01:12:31.071
- Curtis. Uncle Brad gets home
the day after tomorrow!

1493
01:12:31.106 --> 01:12:33.546
And you finding one thing
in two weeks just doesn't help.

1494
01:12:37.882 --> 01:12:41.312
I came here to apologize.

1495
01:12:41.347 --> 01:12:43.215
I know you've been doing
all this for me.

1496
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:44.854
And for us.

1497
01:12:44.889 --> 01:12:47.087
I just don't understand
why we're fighting

1498
01:12:47.122 --> 01:12:48.429
if the whole point
was to be together.

1499
01:12:51.093 --> 01:12:53.225
It's my fault
I'm in this situation.

1500
01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:56.767
and I'm probably gonna
have to come clean to my mom

1501
01:12:56.802 --> 01:12:58.901
and live out the rest
of my days in probation.

1502
01:13:01.268 --> 01:13:04.940
I do have one last idea. though.

1503
01:13:04.975 --> 01:13:07.877
The mall my mom works
at. There's a shoplifter.

1504
01:13:07.912 --> 01:13:10.110
He's been stealing
antiques and stuff.

1505
01:13:10.145 --> 01:13:12.046
- So?

1506
01:13:12.081 --> 01:13:13.883
- So. there's a reward.

1507
01:13:13.918 --> 01:13:15.852
For 5.000 dollars.

1508
01:13:15.887 --> 01:13:17.854
- Why didn't you say so?

1509
01:13:17.889 --> 01:13:19.691
- Because it's really risky.

1510
01:13:19.726 --> 01:13:21.187
My mom's gonna be
all over that place.

1511
01:13:21.222 --> 01:13:23.959
And the odds of us running
into her before the shoplifter

1512
01:13:23.994 --> 01:13:27.468
and if we do.
I'm gonna come clean.

1513
01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:28.601
- I'm in.

1514
01:13:30.429 --> 01:13:31.868
Sorry. little guy.

1515
01:13:31.903 --> 01:13:34.068
You know. these things are
much heavier than they look.

1516
01:13:36.105 --> 01:13:36.939
Friends?

1517
01:13:39.075 --> 01:13:40.074
For life.

1518
01:13:41.814 --> 01:13:45.277
And besides. last-ditch efforts
are always the ones that work.

1519
01:13:45.312 --> 01:13:46.751
- Yeah.

1520
01:13:46.786 --> 01:13:48.379
I don't know why they always
save them till last.

1521
01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:13.074
- So do we stake out.
or search and destroy?

1522
01:14:13.109 --> 01:14:14.944
- Well. search and destroy
makes it harder to avoid my mom

1523
01:14:14.979 --> 01:14:17.617
but we gotta go for it.

1524
01:14:17.652 --> 01:14:18.816
- All right.

1525
01:15:07.196 --> 01:15:08.536
- Oh. I'm sorry.

1526
01:15:08.571 --> 01:15:12.166
I cute kid.
-

1527
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:23.078
Drifting by

1528
01:15:33.123 --> 01:15:36.124
Out in the sun

1529
01:15:44.134 --> 01:15:46.706
- What does a shoplifter
even look like anyway?

1530
01:15:46.741 --> 01:15:47.905
- I don't know.

1531
01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.610
But it looks like
Project Pay Day

1532
01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:52.074
hasn't really paid off. has it?

1533
01:15:52.109 --> 01:15:54.241
Dave?

1534
01:15:54.276 --> 01:15:55.374
- It looks that way now.

1535
01:15:55.409 --> 01:15:56.848
- Why aren't you at the pool?

1536
01:15:56.883 --> 01:16:01.919
- Mom. Ah. ah. Mother. I--

1537
01:16:02.416 --> 01:16:03.052
- Dave. wait.

1538
01:16:03.087 --> 01:16:04.251
- No.

1539
01:16:04.286 --> 01:16:06.121
Look. I made a mistake.
and you need to know.

1540
01:16:06.156 --> 01:16:08.926
But Curtis and Hannah
had nothing to do with it.

1541
01:16:08.961 --> 01:16:11.764
Dave. Explain yourself.

1542
01:16:11.799 --> 01:16:13.524
- Okay. so the truth is--

1543
01:16:13.559 --> 01:16:16.802
- The truth is.
Dave is a great guy.

1544
01:16:16.837 --> 01:16:18.606
and the best friend
I could ever ask for.

1545
01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:21.499
And if he trusts me at all.
he'll follow my lead.

1546
01:16:23.811 --> 01:16:26.009
- Um. be right back.

1547
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:29.848
- What are you doing?

1548
01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:42.663
- Okay. I trust you.
But what are we doing?

1549
01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:44.291
- I think I found
the shoplifter.

1550
01:16:44.326 --> 01:16:45.292
Follow me.

1551
01:17:11.958 --> 01:17:14.156
Not only have I seen him
hanging around the mall.

1552
01:17:14.191 --> 01:17:16.422
but he's the same guy
who tried to take Mr. Moneybags.

1553
01:17:16.457 --> 01:17:18.292
No way!
- Yeah. Stay close.

1554
01:17:38.985 --> 01:17:40.688
- Now what?
Should we call the police?

1555
01:17:40.723 --> 01:17:43.350
- No. We need hard evidence!

1556
01:17:43.385 --> 01:17:45.022
We wait till he leaves.

1557
01:17:45.057 --> 01:17:46.320
grab the stolen goods
from his apartment.

1558
01:17:46.355 --> 01:17:48.124
and get out of there!

1559
01:17:48.159 --> 01:17:49.862
You sure about this?

1560
01:17:49.897 --> 01:17:51.193
- Gotta be.

1561
01:18:45.315 --> 01:18:46.919
- It's locked.

1562
01:18:46.954 --> 01:18:48.118
Why didn't we expect this?

1563
01:18:48.153 --> 01:18:49.757
- Who didn't expect it?

1564
01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.978
- Does this guy have a fake leg?

1565
01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.641
- Maybe that's how
he gets the goods out.

1566
01:19:23.122 --> 01:19:24.484
This place is disgusting.

1567
01:19:35.794 --> 01:19:37.970
- Hey isn't this the book
that Hannah has?

1568
01:19:39.171 --> 01:19:40.973
- Yeah. I think so.
-

1569
01:19:42.977 --> 01:19:44.273
- Ah. In there!

1570
01:19:59.026 --> 01:20:01.422
You think we can
make it to the door?

1571
01:20:01.457 --> 01:20:05.030
- We should grab something to
connect him to the thefts first.

1572
01:20:05.065 --> 01:20:06.559
- I think we're beyond that.

1573
01:20:19.178 --> 01:20:20.573
- It's Hannah.
- Just turn it off.

1574
01:20:29.089 --> 01:20:30.682
- You!
-  Run!

1575
01:20:50.176 --> 01:20:52.539
- It's Hannah again!

1576
01:20:52.574 --> 01:20:54.046
What?!

1577
01:20:54.081 --> 01:20:56.048
What?
Hannah. we're in trouble.

1578
01:20:56.083 --> 01:20:57.676
- I know where the coins are.

1579
01:20:57.711 --> 01:20:58.985
She knows
where the coins are.

1580
01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.382
- Where is she?
- Hannah. where are you?

1581
01:21:01.451 --> 01:21:03.088
Okay. we'll meet you there.

1582
01:21:03.123 --> 01:21:04.089
Chinatown Tunnels.

1583
01:21:04.124 --> 01:21:05.255
- Good a place as any to hide!

1584
01:21:14.794 --> 01:21:16.398
He's got a gun!
-  That is not cool.

1585
01:21:18.105 --> 01:21:19.104
Hannah. Hannah.

1586
01:21:21.141 --> 01:21:22.404
Hannah.

1587
01:21:32.086 --> 01:21:33.679
Guys?

1588
01:21:33.714 --> 01:21:34.922
Curtis?

1589
01:21:34.957 --> 01:21:37.320
Dave? Is that you?
I know where the coins are.

1590
01:21:38.554 --> 01:21:40.092
Guys. where are you?

1591
01:21:40.928 --> 01:21:42.259
Where are
your friends?

1592
01:21:42.294 --> 01:21:43.293
- I don't know.

1593
01:21:44.296 --> 01:21:45.295
What do we do?

1594
01:21:46.727 --> 01:21:48.199
- I don't know.

1595
01:21:48.234 --> 01:21:50.102
What were those
coins you were talking about?

1596
01:21:50.137 --> 01:21:52.203
- Please. I'm just lost.
I don't know.

1597
01:21:52.238 --> 01:21:54.271
- Where's that figurine
you had? That cat.

1598
01:21:59.938 --> 01:22:01.212
- Here.
This is what he wants.

1599
01:22:01.247 --> 01:22:02.774
It must be worth something.

1600
01:22:02.809 --> 01:22:04.116
- Why are you giving it to me?

1601
01:22:05.449 --> 01:22:06.448
- For luck.

1602
01:22:09.123 --> 01:22:10.320
Curtis!
- You.

1603
01:22:10.355 --> 01:22:13.158
- Listen! I'm the one
you want. right?

1604
01:22:13.193 --> 01:22:15.292
- All right. boy.
Where's that figurine?

1605
01:22:15.327 --> 01:22:16.920
You know. that fat cat.

1606
01:22:16.955 --> 01:22:18.933
Come on. Give me the figurine
and then we can talk.

1607
01:22:21.201 --> 01:22:22.937
You want it? You got
it. -

1608
01:22:26.932 --> 01:22:27.898
- Oh. I think for once
in your life.

1609
01:22:27.933 --> 01:22:29.504
you actually got me
out of trouble.

1610
01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:38.018
- Why would you break that
if it was worth so much?

1611
01:22:38.053 --> 01:22:39.415
- Because

1612
01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:42.616
what matters
is on the inside.

1613
01:22:42.651 --> 01:22:44.090
- So. you writing
bad poetry now?

1614
01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.190
- You figured it out. too.

1615
01:22:47.194 --> 01:22:48.523
- Just in time.

1616
01:22:48.558 --> 01:22:51.163
- The Labash coins?
Inside Mr. Moneybags?

1617
01:22:51.198 --> 01:22:53.000
- They've been there all along.

1618
01:22:53.035 --> 01:22:56.168
That's where
Councilman Haft hid the coins.

1619
01:22:56.203 --> 01:22:57.862
He did steal the coins.

1620
01:22:57.897 --> 01:23:00.040
And he did use
the Chinatown Tunnels.

1621
01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:02.603
But that's not where
he decided to hide the coins.

1622
01:23:02.638 --> 01:23:05.672
He decided to hide the coins
right in plain sight

1623
01:23:05.707 --> 01:23:07.179
inside a statue

1624
01:23:07.214 --> 01:23:09.643
that everyone would
always remember him having.

1625
01:23:11.812 --> 01:23:14.021
He put the new statue.
the one with the gold coins.

1626
01:23:14.056 --> 01:23:15.550
where the original had been.

1627
01:23:15.585 --> 01:23:17.618
So. when the police
came to search his office.

1628
01:23:17.653 --> 01:23:19.983
they didn't find anything.

1629
01:23:20.018 --> 01:23:23.624
- So. all that business about
Lei-Lei stealing the coins?

1630
01:23:23.659 --> 01:23:24.988
That was just a red herring?

1631
01:23:25.023 --> 01:23:26.330
Not quite.

1632
01:23:26.365 --> 01:23:28.134
It seems that part of
the story was embellished.

1633
01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:31.071
But without it.
we wouldn't have searched

1634
01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.996
- In the bay!

1635
01:23:33.031 --> 01:23:34.041
- What?

1636
01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:40.003
That's what
I figured.

1637
01:23:40.038 --> 01:23:41.675
That Haft must have disposed
of the original Mr. Moneybags

1638
01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:43.314
from the tunnels.

1639
01:23:43.349 --> 01:23:44.843
What?

1640
01:23:44.878 --> 01:23:46.548
That's where you
found the original

1641
01:23:46.583 --> 01:23:47.747
statue in the water.

1642
01:23:47.782 --> 01:23:49.419
Haft needed to get rid
of the original.

1643
01:23:49.454 --> 01:23:51.058
so no one would
suspect the duplicate.

1644
01:23:51.093 --> 01:23:53.225
So. he found this exit.

1645
01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:55.821
And threw the old statue
into the bay.

1646
01:23:55.856 --> 01:23:57.020
-So
you found the original?

1647
01:23:57.055 --> 01:23:58.857
I was right.

1648
01:23:58.892 --> 01:24:00.529
- We did it.

1649
01:24:00.564 --> 01:24:01.827
What the--!

1650
01:24:01.862 --> 01:24:02.894
- The gold!

1651
01:24:05.272 --> 01:24:07.932
So is this guy dead
or unconscious or what?

1652
01:24:07.967 --> 01:24:12.970
If he rolls higher
than a 15. he can regenerate.

1653
01:24:14.545 --> 01:24:16.039
- Hey!

1654
01:24:16.074 --> 01:24:17.084
- You again?

1655
01:24:17.119 --> 01:24:19.086
- You cosplayers
need a new quest?

1656
01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:20.582
LARPers.

1657
01:24:20.617 --> 01:24:22.089
- What did you have in mind?

1658
01:24:22.124 --> 01:24:24.619
- Well. there's a reward
for this guy's capture.

1659
01:24:24.654 --> 01:24:28.359
Five thousand dolla
5.000 gold pieces.

1660
01:24:28.394 --> 01:24:29.723
You guys up for the challenge?

1661
01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:33.023
- A really real reward?

1662
01:24:33.058 --> 01:24:35.058
Why don't
you want it?

1663
01:24:35.093 --> 01:24:36.103
- Well

1664
01:24:38.734 --> 01:24:41.075
we have our own quest to finish.

1665
01:24:55.355 --> 01:24:56.882
- Okay. Here's what we can say.

1666
01:24:56.917 --> 01:24:58.488
- No. I'm not lying anymore.

1667
01:24:58.523 --> 01:24:59.918
- Curtis. I'm supposed
to be coming clean.

1668
01:24:59.953 --> 01:25:01.590
She already saw us at the mall.

1669
01:25:01.625 --> 01:25:02.987
- We're right behind you. Dave.

1670
01:25:03.022 --> 01:25:04.956
- Who's we. hot stuff?

1671
01:25:04.991 --> 01:25:06.265
I'm in this for the gold.

1672
01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.498
not to see your mom
take your head off.

1673
01:25:10.535 --> 01:25:11.831
- Mom? Dad ?

1674
01:25:11.866 --> 01:25:13.096
- Shhh!

1675
01:25:13.131 --> 01:25:13.833
You don't have to.

1676
01:25:13.868 --> 01:25:17.342
- Dave? What's going on?

1677
01:25:17.377 --> 01:25:19.003
You need to explain yourself.

1678
01:25:19.038 --> 01:25:20.906
- Guys. I have something
to tell you.

1679
01:25:20.941 --> 01:25:24.415
I don't have a summer job.
I don't work at the pool.

1680
01:25:24.450 --> 01:25:26.417
I've been lying to you
all summer.

1681
01:25:26.452 --> 01:25:27.748
Dad. you were right.

1682
01:25:27.783 --> 01:25:29.783
If I can't take
the responsibility to get a job.

1683
01:25:29.818 --> 01:25:31.081
I should at least
take the responsibility

1684
01:25:31.116 --> 01:25:32.588
about lying to you guys.

1685
01:25:32.623 --> 01:25:34.854
I'm really sorry.
And I shouldn't have done it.

1686
01:25:34.889 --> 01:25:36.922
- Well. I. uh
I guess I'm glad

1687
01:25:36.957 --> 01:25:40.090
that you're being honest now.

1688
01:25:40.125 --> 01:25:41.465
- We are livid.

1689
01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.697
Do you think
I'm going to tell you

1690
01:25:42.732 --> 01:25:44.303
it's all okay
just because you ?

1691
01:25:44.338 --> 01:25:47.933
- No! And I've also learned that
some mistakes take time to fix.

1692
01:25:47.968 --> 01:25:50.100
and with hard work.

1693
01:25:50.135 --> 01:25:52.872
So I'm willing to accept
whatever punishment you see fit.

1694
01:25:52.907 --> 01:25:54.874
and I will also work
as your assistant

1695
01:25:54.909 --> 01:25:56.007
until I earn enough money

1696
01:25:56.042 --> 01:25:57.811
to pay for my
back-to-school supplies

1697
01:25:57.846 --> 01:26:00.044
or college fund or
whatever.

1698
01:26:00.079 --> 01:26:01.980
Just like we agreed.

1699
01:26:02.015 --> 01:26:03.487
- Well. I

1700
01:26:03.522 --> 01:26:04.950
- And I know that you wanted me
to take some responsibility

1701
01:26:04.985 --> 01:26:08.118
and work hard this summer.
but I just needed some help

1702
01:26:08.153 --> 01:26:11.231
figuring out the things
that were worth working for.

1703
01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:12.859
- That's why you have friends.

1704
01:26:14.159 --> 01:26:15.631
- Well. friends

1705
01:26:15.666 --> 01:26:18.205
- Great to have them to rely on.

1706
01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.503
- Guys. I guess
I'm not going to be able to

1707
01:26:19.538 --> 01:26:20.702
see you around for a while.

1708
01:26:20.737 --> 01:26:21.868
Oh. stop!

1709
01:26:23.509 --> 01:26:26.873
Dave. you know we love you
more than anything.

1710
01:26:26.908 --> 01:26:30.646
And your honesty.
it means everything to us.

1711
01:26:30.681 --> 01:26:34.078
This is very grown-up of you.

1712
01:26:34.113 --> 01:26:36.421
- Yeah. and I don't
want to rush that.

1713
01:26:36.456 --> 01:26:38.258
but. while I'm being honest.

1714
01:26:38.293 --> 01:26:42.295
there's probably something else
that we should tell you about.

1715
01:26:47.566 --> 01:26:50.534
So my mom's just making me
work nights with her

1716
01:26:50.569 --> 01:26:52.536
for the first two months
of school.

1717
01:26:52.571 --> 01:26:55.902
- Could've been worse!
For both of us.

1718
01:26:55.937 --> 01:26:58.003
- So why didn't you
just keep the coins?

1719
01:26:58.038 --> 01:27:00.170
- Well. we figured they belong
to you more than anyone!

1720
01:27:00.205 --> 01:27:01.842
Your family's story
is the whole reason

1721
01:27:01.877 --> 01:27:03.349
we found them
in the first place.

1722
01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:04.713
Plus. they're an important part

1723
01:27:04.748 --> 01:27:06.451
of the local
Chinese immigrant history.

1724
01:27:06.486 --> 01:27:09.113
- That's why I donated them to
the Chinese History Museum.

1725
01:27:09.148 --> 01:27:10.917
They should have been there
a long time ago.

1726
01:27:10.952 --> 01:27:12.358
- And money isn't everything.

1727
01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:14.756
There are more important
things in life.

1728
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:20.267
- Truer words. Dave.
Truer words.

1729
01:27:21.963 --> 01:27:23.963
- Although
a debt is a debt.

1730
01:27:23.998 --> 01:27:25.701
And since the insurance
finally came through

1731
01:27:25.736 --> 01:27:27.065
on my windshield repair

1732
01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:29.936
I think I owe you about
5.000 dollars.

1733
01:27:31.907 --> 01:27:33.247
Plus interest. of course.

1734
01:27:34.778 --> 01:27:37.581
Consider it a 'thank you'
for all you guys have done.

1735
01:27:37.616 --> 01:27:39.418
- It was nothing.

1736
01:28:14.015 --> 01:28:15.421
- The old adage is true.

1737
01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:17.115
Most opportunities are missed

1738
01:28:17.150 --> 01:28:19.623
because they go around
looking like hard work.

1739
01:28:19.658 --> 01:28:22.626
And remember.
what you focus on becomes--

1740
01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:52.018
- Good morning.
and welcome back.

1741
01:28:52.053 --> 01:28:54.823
Today. we're gonna start with
an old school assignment.

1742
01:28:54.858 --> 01:28:57.155
An essay of what you did
last summer.

1743
01:28:57.190 --> 01:28:59.322
Hopefully.
it's gonna be more interesting

1744
01:28:59.357 --> 01:29:01.665
than just playing video games.

1745
01:29:08.839 --> 01:29:13.336
Talk about forever

1746
01:29:18.112 --> 01:29:22.983
Until I can't breathe

1747
01:29:25.185 --> 01:29:30.188
All the whole night through

1748
01:29:34.799 --> 01:29:39.802
The distant tumbling stars

1749
01:29:46.404 --> 01:29:49.174
That it's your first kiss

1750
01:29:58.086 --> 01:30:02.924
Grow uuuup

1751
01:30:10.604 --> 01:30:12.769
And scream

1752
01:30:24.948 --> 01:30:26.981
Have ever seen

1753
01:30:45.034 --> 01:30:49.135
I don't wanna grow up
