[children shouting playfully in distance]

[laptop buzzing softly]

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.505
[haunting music continues]

12
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.302
-[woman] What are you eating?
-[girl] Guess.

13
00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.097
-[woman] I can't guess.
-[girl in sing-song] Bet you can.

14
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.266
-[woman] How can I guess?
-[girl] What day is it today?

15
00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.809
[woman] Uh. it's Monday.

16
00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:24.853
Oh. Sunday night's pizza night.

17
00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.688
-You're eating leftover pizza.
-[girl giggles]

18
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:30.233
Hey. make Dad go pick you out a pumpkin.
It's that time of year again.

19
00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.734
-They're all over.
-[buzzer rings]

20
00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.194
-[girl] Okay.
-[woman] All right.

21
00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.780
-Let me talk to Daddy. sweetheart.
-[boy over intercom] Delivery.

22
00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.240
-[girl] Daddy!
-[buzzing]

23
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.117
Daddy!

24
00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.000
[meowing]

25
00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.421
-[man] Hey. Slugger.
-[woman] Hey.

26
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.674
[man] Tell me something good.
-[woman] Something good.

27
00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:56.801
[both chuckle]

28
00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.637
-[woman] You were right about 101.
-[man] How's that?

29
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.557
[woman] The Russells are very white.
[chuckles]

30
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.143
[man] There goes the neighborhood.
[chuckles]

31
00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:07.854
[woman] But who moves in
after a one-day paint job?

32
00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.148
[man] Well. you said it was in good shape.

33
00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:14.194
[woman] I wish you were here.

34
00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.864
-[man] Who does that help. saying that?
-[woman] I can beat myself up if I want.

35
00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:20.742
[man] Go for it.
It's just an audience of one.

36
00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:21.993
I'm not playing.

37
00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.621
[woman] Tell me to go outside.

38
00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:28.124
[man] Why not make today
the day you go outside?

39
00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.877
So. what's the latest on the street?

40
00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:34.088
What happened with the barking dog?

41
00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:37.508
I thought we were going
to talk about medications.

42
00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:38.843
We'll get there.

43
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.387
Would you like to take a seat?

44
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.848
Did it get squared away?

45
00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:44.891
The dog?

46
00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.101
Um…

47
00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:50.104
I guess they started bringing him inside.

48
00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:51.940
Did you end up calling 311?

49
00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:54.150
[chuckles] Oh. David talked me out of it.

50
00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:57.820
It's more of a bother for him anyway.
It's louder downstairs.

51
00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.907
So. I… must have talked to somebody.

52
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.325
Peaceful resolution.

53
00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.869
This is the second session
that you've done this.

54
00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.454
Ask about the neighborhood?

55
00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.832
Does that make you uncomfortable?

56
00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.293
I just don't know what you're goin' for.

57
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:15.546
How's the prayer group?

58
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.799
[woman sighs] They're getting by.

59
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.343
[man]
Do you think they know you're watching?

60
00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.512
Is this really what you wanna talk about?

61
00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.057
What about 101?

62
00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.143
Looks like they already moved in.

63
00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:30.645
What'd they pay?

64
00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:32.939
Five-five. They were asking for six.

65
00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:34.148
Who are they?

66
00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:35.275
The Russells.

67
00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.736
Alistair and Jane.
The broker says they're from Boston.

68
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.988
Where's the money from?

69
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.948
She says he's a banker.

70
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:44.117
But there's practically
nothing about them online.

71
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.493
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

72
00:04:45.576 --> 00:04:47.203
What the fuck. Karl?

73
00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:51.291
Curiosity is evidence
of a decreased depression pattern.

74
00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:55.712
People who snoop on their neighbors
don't kill themselves? [chuckles]

75
00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.256
Let's try this.

76
00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:01.342
People who attempt suicide
lose the right to joke about it.

77
00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:06.889
I have a review with Dr. Kenner this week.

78
00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:10.310
Seeing as I've been unable to get you
out the front door for the last 10 months.

79
00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.437
she's gonna wonder about
the source of my optimism.

80
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:15.189
Let's talk about the Elevan.

81
00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:17.525
Now that you've curtailed the drinking.

82
00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:19.569
how are you feeling
about the side effects?

83
00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.363
[sloshing]

84
00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.032
[man] I think you're reading into it.

85
00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:27.744
[woman] I've been a shrink for 15 years.
I know a threat when I hear one.

86
00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.162
[man] He's on your side. Slugger.

87
00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:30.997
He's the reason you're still here.

88
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.666
[woman] It's not really therapy
if there's a knife at your back.

89
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.003
[man] He comes every week. rain or shine.
He's been there all the way through.

90
00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:39.589
[woman]
No. he's getting off on controlling me.

91
00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:42.008
-[man] Really?
-[woman] Yes. Did you read about Elevan?

92
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:43.384
Take a look at the side effects.

93
00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.428
[man]
I know you're not supposed to drink on it.

94
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.430
[woman chuckles] They always say that.

95
00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:50.516
[insistent music playing]

96
00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:07.075
[trumpet playing]

97
00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.332
[sighs]

98
00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:23.841
[woman breathing heavily]

-[gasps]

100
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.681
[glass shatters]

101
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:31.849
Shit.

102
00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.267
[paper rustling]

103
00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.607
[insistent music swelling]

104
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.942
[buzzer rings]

105
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.778
Yes?

106
00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:46.572
[boy over speaker]
I live. um. across the street there.

107
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.825
And?

108
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.494
My mom asked me to give you this.

109
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.413
I'm sorry…

110
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.332
I'm not prepared for visitors.

111
00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.084
[boy] Oh. okay.

112
00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:00.962
Do you have any ideas about
what I should do with this?

113
00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:03.589
You can just…

114
00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.468
Push the door.

115
00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:09.762
[buzzer sounds]

116
00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.807
Hi. I'm Ethan.

117
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:13.766
Yes.

118
00:07:14.308 --> 00:07:15.601
Hi. Anna.

119
00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.771
I'm from… across the street.

120
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.314
[Anna] Yes.

121
00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:23.443
Sorry. I know you're not having.
uh. visitors.

122
00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.153
No. I'm… fine.

123
00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.029
You just surprised me. that's all.

124
00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:29.323
I'm not really a visitor so much.

125
00:07:29.907 --> 00:07:32.034
I'm kind of. uh. more like a neighbor.

126
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.207
-I love lavender.
-Heh.

127
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.586
My mom asked me
to give it to you. like… days ago.

128
00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:44.881
I think that I'm the one
supposed to be giving you a gift. eh…

129
00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.382
Welcome to the neighborhood.

130
00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.925
-[cat meows]
-[Ethan] Mm.

131
00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.725
I like cats' tongues.

132
00:07:57.226 --> 00:07:59.479
Sorry they're not fish fingers. buddy.
[chuckles]

133
00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.730
He likes you.

134
00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:02.523
No.

135
00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:05.693
How do you like your new house?

136
00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:07.278
I miss the old one.

137
00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.031
But we had to leave Boston.

138
00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:13.284
Are those your… people?

139
00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:14.827
Family? Yes.

140
00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:16.913
Are they home?

141
00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:21.501
No. they don't live here. We're separated.

142
00:08:23.127 --> 00:08:24.128
How old is she?

143
00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:26.547
She's eight.

144
00:08:29.717 --> 00:08:30.968
How old are you?

145
00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:33.638
I'm gonna be 16 in six months.

146
00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:34.722
Five months.

147
00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:42.813
What do you do?

148
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.319
Oh. I'm a psychologist. I work with kids.

149
00:08:48.402 --> 00:08:49.278
Really?

150
00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:50.947
Really.

151
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.407
-That's interesting.
-Why is that interesting?

152
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:57.370
I mean. it's more interesting
than. like. working at Taco Bell.

153
00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.497
-[chuckles]
-Why would kids need a psychologist?

154
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.791
You really don't know why
a kid would need a psychologist?

155
00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:04.460
No. I mean. I'm sure they do.
but I mean. like. why?

156
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.463
Like. why do the kids who see you
need a psychologist?

157
00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:10.675
-All sorts of reasons.
-School shootings or torturing someone?

158
00:09:10.758 --> 00:09:14.720
No. it doesn't have to be that dramatic.
Some of them are depressed.

159
00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:16.305
some suffer from anxiety…

160
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:20.142
some of them are… just having
a hard time adjusting to a new place.

161
00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:31.362
I can see your house from my room.

162
00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:34.240
[elusive music plays]

163
00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:35.866
I mean…

164
00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:37.660
normally.

165
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:41.956
Right now. I can see…

166
00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:45.001
my dad from your house.

167
00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:48.296
[Ethan sighs]

168
00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:53.217
Are you okay?

169
00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:55.469
[Ethan] Yeah.

170
00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:57.680
Are you sure?

171
00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.641
No. nothing. I just…

172
00:10:01.642 --> 00:10:02.727
[softly] Hey.

173
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.103
[gasps softly]

174
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.566
You can talk to me.

175
00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.736
I don't know anyone here.

176
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.654
You know me.

177
00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:15.656
Not really.

178
00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.284
Well. you could.

179
00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:19.952
Really?

180
00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:21.954
We-we can be friends?

181
00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:26.000
Sure.

182
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.171
Wow. You have a lot of movies.

183
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.424
Too many. That's what my husband says.

184
00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:36.052
I thought you said
you guys were separated.

185
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.638
He's still my husband. but you're right.

186
00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.682
You're welcome to borrow anything.

187
00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:45.144
Uh… My dad's kind of a tyrant with the TV.

188
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.313
Oh.

189
00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:53.486
-Goodbye. Punch.
-[purrs]

190
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:55.696
I'm sorry I'm so allergic to you.

191
00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:58.491
Why didn't you say something?

192
00:10:59.075 --> 00:10:59.992
Oh.

193
00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.661
I don't wanna offend him.

194
00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:03.954
He's not that sensitive.

195
00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:05.456
Okay.

196
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.250
[Punch meows softly]

197
00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:15.007
Okay. then.

198
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.759
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

199
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.014
See you around?

200
00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.182
Yeah. see you around.

201
00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:27.103
[elusive music turns warmer]

202
00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:31.440
…in some incredibly rustic community
where good manners are unknown…

203
00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.360
[man and Anna] …or you suffer
from the common feminine delusion

204
00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:36.195
that the mere fact of being a woman

205
00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:38.948
exempts you from the rules
of civilized conduct.

206
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.241
[Anna] Conduct.

207
00:11:40.324 --> 00:11:42.034
-[man and Anna] Possibly both.
-[laughing]

208
00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.704
[woman on TV] Possibly.
But here's what I wanted to show you…

209
00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:46.080
[continues laughing]

210
00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.041
[coughing]

211
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:55.548
[laughing]

212
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.675
[loud thud]

213
00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:02.847
-[Anna shudders]
-[electrical ringing]

214
00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:10.271
-[buzzer ringing]
-[kids chattering outside]

215
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.356
[man] I'm headed to Brooklyn.

216
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.277
-You need me to take care of anything?
-Right. Uh. no. Thanks. I'm good.

217
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.028
[man] Sure? Take out the garbage?

218
00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.407
-Okay. As long as you're here.
-[man] Okay.

219
00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.995
You know. David. you've been
my tenant for three months.

220
00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:27.371
You don't have to be so formal.

221
00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.665
You can just come in through
the basement stairs.

222
00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:32.418
-No. I don't wanna startle ya.
-[bottles clinking]

223
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:34.503
It's dark in here.
Do the bulbs need changing?

224
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.298
-I like it dim.
-Okay.

225
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.301
Oh. Halloween tonight.

226
00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:42.762
How do we do it without you going outside?

227
00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:44.722
You want me to get some candy?

228
00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:46.307
I'm not going to give out candy.

229
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.601
I'm going to turn the lights out
and pretend I'm not home.

230
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.733
We could just get a bowl of candy
and leave it on the porch. like…

231
00:12:56.567 --> 00:13:00.154
Any kid would take it within a minute
and then they'd take the bowl.

232
00:13:00.237 --> 00:13:03.449
Why don't we get a bowl of apples?
'Cause kids won't take apples.

233
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.576
Then what's the point?

234
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.040
Yeah. Okay.

235
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.126
Have a nice time.

236
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.337
Sure. Happy Halloween.

237
00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:18.339
[door closes]

238
00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:21.133
[woman on TV] Let your mind
go back to your childhood.

239
00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:22.468
-Was it happy?
-[buzzer rings]

240
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:25.471
-Whom did you know in your childhood?
-[buzzer rings]

241
00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:28.682
[man] I'm haunted but I… [sighs]

242

-I can't see by what.
-[thud]

243
00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:32.895
-[gasps]
-It's no use.

244
00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.396
[woman] You lived somewhere.

245
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.731
-You had a mother.
-[thud]

246
00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.483
You were loved. you had friends.

247
00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:38.484
[man] Yes.

248
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.573

249
00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:48.452

Get away from my house!

257

[thuds]

258
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.774
[kids shouting and laughing]

259
00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:19.817
-[kid] Right there!
-Hey!

260
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.735
-[kid] Get her!
-[gasps]

261
00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.363
[tense music playing]

[tense music fades away]

271
00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:08.908
Hey.

272
00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:12.494
You're gonna have to convince me
I don't need to call an ambulance.

273
00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.121
[Anna] No. don't do that.

274
00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:16.790
Okay. you know who you are?
You know what day it is?

275
00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:20.502
Yeah. I'm Anna. It's Halloween.

276
00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:21.754
Okay. how many fingers?

277
00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:23.547
Three.

278
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:27.051
Okay. You're all right.
You're gonna be all right. Just…

279
00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:28.761
breathing would be good.

280
00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:31.639
I was headed across the street

281
00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.599
when those little shits
started chucking eggs.

282
00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:35.142
and. oof. you went down hard.

283
00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:36.310
You're Jane Russell.

284
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.313
What makes you say that?

285
00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:42.608
[Anna] Your… your son came by.

286
00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:43.984
Ethan.

287
00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:46.195
[Jane]
Sit up in case you got a concussion.

288
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:49.365
-[faucet runs]
-[Jane] Jesus. it's dark in here.

289
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.033
Do you faint a lot?

290
00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.577
I didn't faint.

291
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.788
I mean. it's… like fainting.

292
00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:58.666
-[Jane pours drink]
-I can't go outside.

293
00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:01.418
Um… you didn't go outside.

294
00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:04.421
-No. I get panic attacks.
-Who doesn't?

295
00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:06.590
Here. Have some of this brandy. please.

296
00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.717
Uh. I'm agoraphobic.

297
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:12.721
I can't go outside.

298
00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:16.392
Oh! Oh. [chuckles]

299
00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:19.144
You're stuck inside this shitty house.
Oh. [clicks tongue]

300
00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:22.481
Oh. man. I'd hate to be stuck
inside a house this shitty.

301
00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:24.274
[muffled thud]

302
00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:26.068
Is that your husband coming home?

303
00:16:27.027 --> 00:16:28.696
It's my tenant.

304
00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:30.990
He lives in the basement.

305
00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:35.619
So. um. what do you do all day?

306
00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:37.037
I mean. do you work?

307
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.794
Oh. God. I'm so fucking nosy.

308
00:16:43.877 --> 00:16:47.506
I… I should just go. Um--

309
00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:49.466
-Do you want me to go?
-No.

310
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.218
Um…

311
00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:52.553
No. it's…

312
00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:54.346
It's all right. I'm fine.

313
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.598
I… counsel people.

314
00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.058
You counsel people?

315
00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:01.020
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh. you're a shrink.

316
00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:03.522
Oh! [chuckles] That's a twist.

317
00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:07.026
You married?

318
00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:09.361
-Separated.
-Ah.

319
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.196
And kids?

320
00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:15.034
My daughter Olivia is with her father.

321
00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:16.869
Oh. that's tough.

322
00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:18.328
Yeah.

323
00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:21.290
Yeah. Separated from your kid.
that's really tough.

324
00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:23.959
I talk to them every day.

325
00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:26.420
Yeah. it's just… It's--

326
00:17:27.337 --> 00:17:29.965
It's not the same as them
being here. though. is it?

327
00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:34.553
Take another drink. please.

328
00:17:41.643 --> 00:17:44.521
-Do you wanna go outside?
-You know. I have a shrink of my own.

329
00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:47.775
[laughing] Okay. Okay. I get it. I get it.

330
00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:50.569
All right. sorry. That sounds very wise.

331
00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:51.653
Yeah.

332
00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:54.948
I get it. [chuckles]

333
00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:57.242
Yeah.

334
00:17:57.826 --> 00:17:58.660
Yeah.

335
00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:02.498
We've been trying to get me
to go outside using an umbrella.

336
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:03.665
Uh-huh.

337
00:18:04.708 --> 00:18:06.960
I haven't… been able to do it yet.

338
00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:08.378
Oh. [smacks lips]

339
00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:09.755
You will.

340
00:18:10.672 --> 00:18:11.507
You will.

341
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.716
You'll figure it out.

342
00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:15.010
-[pops cork]
-[Jane] Notice I'm not asking

343
00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.179
-what made you this way.
-[Anna] What way?

344
00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:18.388
Agoraphobic.

345
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:21.391
I have anxiety. I have…

346
00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:23.811
an anxiety disorder.

347
00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:26.230
-Punch. [clicking tongue] Punch.
-So. um…

348
00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:28.273
-[camera clicks]
-Good boy.

349
00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:30.109
That's what all these pills are for?

350
00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:31.235
-[Anna] Mm-hmm.
-Huh.

351
00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:33.779
So. what does… what does this one do?

352
00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:35.072
This. uh. pink one.

353
00:18:35.155 --> 00:18:36.573
Uh. that's Inderal.

354
00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:38.617
Ah. Beta blocker.

355
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.785
How do you know that?

356
00:18:39.868 --> 00:18:42.121
Um. 'cause it says so on the bottle.

357
00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:44.456
[both chuckle]

358
00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:47.793
Pretty sure you're not supposed to be…
taking these with alcohol.

359
00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:49.378
[Anna] Mm.

360
00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:52.548
[inhales deeply]

361
00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:55.092
Thank you for the candle.

362
00:18:56.093 --> 00:18:58.428
Ethan brought it by. Thanks.

363
00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:00.722
Oh. Wow. okay. subject change.

364
00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:02.141
[clicks tongue] Uh-uh.

365
00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:03.725
I think I hurt my neck.

366
00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.978
-[both chuckle]
-He's a nice boy.

367
00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.025
-Look.
-Oh. what a cutie.

368
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:13.152
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

369
00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:16.155
He's my guy. My little baby guy.

370
00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:21.160
You know. when you have a kid.
you say. "He's my kid. my guy."

371
00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:23.495
Like he's yours. like he belongs to you.

372
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:26.248
-That's not really how it feels.
-You belong to them.

373
00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:27.332
Right.

374
00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:29.418
Right.

375
00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:31.003
You belong to them.

376
00:19:31.086 --> 00:19:33.088
And maybe you never belonged
to anybody before.

377
00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:36.383
I mean. maybe. maybe you thought
you belonged to your parents.

378
00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:39.094
You grew out of that. You certainly
didn't belong to your husband.

379
00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.597
Then this kid comes along.
and he's just got you.

380
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:45.851
[laughs] I don't have to tell you that.

381

[Jane sips drink]

382
00:19:56.987 --> 00:19:58.071
I like your earrings.

383
00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:00.949
Oh. Oh. thanks. yeah. A gift.

384
00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.619
They're a gift from an old boyfriend.

385
00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:04.953
Does your husband mind?

386
00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.455
I doubt he knows.

387
00:20:07.497 --> 00:20:10.000
[both laugh]

388
00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:11.501
He has trust issues.

389
00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:12.628
Oh. why is that?

390
00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:14.671
-Oh. I don't know.
-You don't know? Mmm.

391
00:20:14.755 --> 00:20:18.300
No. Come on. no. no.
I don't know. I don't know.

392
00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.177
-No. it's… [clears throat]
-Hmm.

393
00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.223
[sucks teeth] Who knows
why he has them? Um…

394
00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:27.184
He's a good guy. he's a good father.

395
00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:28.310
He's just. you know…

396
00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.938
-He's tight.
-[Anna] Mm.

397
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.397
Controlling. and like…

398
00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:37.152
I have my own issues.
but I work through them and…

399
00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:38.528
I can handle them.

400
00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:41.073
Maybe sometimes I have to…

401
00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:43.617
get in between them and I--

402
00:20:44.534 --> 00:20:46.536
I worry about Ethan. 'cause…

403
00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:48.747
he's sensitive.

404
00:21:00.008 --> 00:21:00.926
Family's…

405
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.803

Why is your family complicated?

-[Jane] Look.
-Oh. wow! That's amazing!

410
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:19.486
Yeah. Jane Russell original.

412
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:23.282
-See how I changed the subject on you?
-I did.

413
00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.534
Yeah. you don't know
who you're fooling with.

Uh. it's Alistair Russell.

I… I'm sorry to bother you.

423
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.894
I just wanted to know…

424
00:22:33.977 --> 00:22:38.774
Well. I'm just curious if any of my family
has come around to see you this evening.

425
00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:41.985
No.

426
00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:46.198
Oh.

427
00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:49.117
No. I-- I've been alone.

Thank your wife.

432
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.256
For the candle. Ethan brought it over.

433
00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:05.133

434
00:23:09.137 --> 00:23:10.097

441
00:23:55.058 --> 00:23:57.227
[Anna] I think there's somebody
in my house.

442
00:23:57.853 --> 00:23:59.396
What's your address. ma'am?

443
00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:03.483
It's 104. West 121st Street.

444
00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:06.862
-[screams] I'm sorry.
-[man] Whoa!

-Ma'am?
-Yeah. I know him.

448
00:24:13.243 --> 00:24:14.661
It's a false alarm. I'm sorry.

449
00:24:14.744 --> 00:24:16.746
I-- I buzzed.
I did buzz half an hour ago.

[sighing heavily]

451
00:24:20.041 --> 00:24:22.210
And I cleaned the eggs
off your front porch.

452
00:24:23.336 --> 00:24:24.796
What are you looking for?

453
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.924
A guy across the street
asked me to help him open some boxes.

454
00:24:28.008 --> 00:24:29.176
store some stuff.

455
00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:31.720
I thought you might have a box cutter.

456
00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:35.432
I didn't know you were a handyman.
I thought you were a singer-songwriter.

457
00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:36.892
Which is why I am a handyman.

458
00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:38.643
[chuckles]

459
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.485
You know you've got mold?

460
00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:47.861
Yeah. I do.

[David] You're gonna need a pro
to seal that roof. It's dangerous.

467
00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:12.385
I'll call somebody.

Yes.

Russell.

472
00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:21.561
You know him?

473
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.439
How did he find you?

474
00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:25.899

Ethan. what's going on over there?

539
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.150
He's not a bad guy.

540
00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:58.236
He has a lot of stress.
It builds up in him and has to get it out.

541
00:28:58.319 --> 00:28:59.779
-It's all right.
-It's not all right.

542
00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:01.948
Stop saying it's all right.
It's clearly not all right.

543
00:29:03.199 --> 00:29:05.201
I've gotta go home.
I should not have come over.

It's okay.

550

Why are you so nice to me?

551
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.725
Because children need protection.

552

I want you to take my number.

555
00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:41.946
Is your mom okay?

556
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:44.324
[Ethan] Yeah. I… I guess so.

557
00:29:45.074 --> 00:29:47.494
I mean. she has to take his side.

558
00:29:47.577 --> 00:29:48.620
[Anna] Okay. Um…

559
00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:50.580
All right. look.

[Anna] You never know
what the right thing is to do.

568
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.160
You want to call
Children's Protective Services.

569
00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:30.954
it's my word against the father's.

570

[Anna] Karl says curiosity is healthy.

573
00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:38.378
[man] You said he was getting off
on controlling you.

574
00:30:38.461 --> 00:30:40.964

-No. I don't think so.
-[chuckles]

580
00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:54.811
If I knew how to work my phone
I could play it back for you.

[Karl] Looks like fun. right?

585
00:31:04.612 --> 00:31:06.239
Looks like he's escaping.

586
00:31:06.322 --> 00:31:08.324
I'm gonna give you another number. Anna.

587
00:31:08.408 --> 00:31:12.370

No.

598

I went because your case
was like my father's.

599
00:31:48.281 --> 00:31:50.325
I know he didn't kill my stepmother.

600

What are you doing in my house?

684

No. why is he here?

that you made a mistake…

You have never met my wife.

We spent the evening together.

No. no. No. I don't think so.

696
00:38:32.393 --> 00:38:35.438
In fact. he came here looking for her.

697
00:38:35.521 --> 00:38:38.316

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.878
-Did you take a picture?
-I did not!

710
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:00.838
She's just admitted
she's spying on our house.

711
00:39:00.921 --> 00:39:02.673
-Mr. Russell…
-Why didn't you take a picture?

712
00:39:02.757 --> 00:39:05.634
The important thing is.
is that everybody's okay. yeah?

713
00:39:05.718 --> 00:39:07.720
[breathes heavily]

714
00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:09.805
Then where is she?

715
00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:12.308
Where's Jane?

716
00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.061

718
00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:22.985
[woman] I'm sorry we haven't met.

719
00:39:25.946 --> 00:39:27.323
I'm Jane Russell.

720
00:39:29.241 --> 00:39:30.284
She's not Jane.

721
00:39:32.995 --> 00:39:34.038
I promise I am.

722
00:39:34.955 --> 00:39:35.956
No. you're not Jane.

723
00:39:36.457 --> 00:39:37.958
She's not Jane. I know Jane.

724
00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:39.168
Jane's been in my house.

725
00:39:39.251 --> 00:39:40.378
This is absurd.

726
00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:41.879
That's Jane Russell.

727
00:39:42.838 --> 00:39:43.923
Get Ethan.

728
00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.596
Are you okay. Dr. Fox?

729

[breathes shakily]

730
00:39:55.768 --> 00:39:56.769
Tell them.

731
00:39:59.313 --> 00:40:00.898
You've never met my mother.

732
00:40:08.948 --> 00:40:11.200
Well. this has been great fun.

733
00:40:11.283 --> 00:40:13.911
[uneasy music continues]

734
00:40:15.287 --> 00:40:16.997
See you at the block party.

735
00:40:22.128 --> 00:40:25.214
You made a 911 call yesterday
about an intruder in your house?

736
00:40:25.714 --> 00:40:26.799
No.

737
00:40:26.882 --> 00:40:29.343
I mean. yes. But that was a mistake.

738
00:40:29.885 --> 00:40:32.012
It's a criminal offense
to make false police reports.

739
00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:33.931
Thank you. Detective.

740
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:37.476
Am I okay to leave you alone. Dr. Fox?

741
00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:41.647
Look. you need anything.
you. um. you call me.

742
00:40:42.189 --> 00:40:43.732
Day or night. Hmm?

743
00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:45.693
I have four kids.

744
00:40:46.193 --> 00:40:47.945
I don't sleep. [chuckles]

745
00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.240
Be well. Dr. Fox.

-[Anna] I was trying to help her.

750
00:41:09.508 --> 00:41:11.886
Not record it for posterity.
Are you doubting me. too?

751
00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:13.929
-[man] I'm on your side.
-You don't sound like it.

752
00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:17.057
-Understandable they don't believe you.
-[Anna] Because I didn't take a picture?

753
00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:20.227
[man] Because you're not healthy.
And I'm not sure you're getting better.

Hi. Shelly.
I'm trying to reach Alistair Russell

761
00:42:15.658 --> 00:42:17.868
and Joan said that I should speak to you.

762
00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:19.036
He doesn't work here.

763
00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:22.206
-I thought he transferred to Manhattan.
-Yes. but not with us.

764
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.501
Oh. he left Atkinson?

765
00:42:25.584 --> 00:42:28.671
[sighs] You could try calling Boston.
I really don't know much about it.

766
00:42:29.755 --> 00:42:32.007
Well. it couldn't have
happened very long ago.

767
00:42:32.675 --> 00:42:34.426
You're gonna wanna call Boston.

[Steve] Oh. sorry. not in Boston.

Big company. small office.
You'd have to call New York.

789
00:43:45.414 --> 00:43:49.335
[Anna] Okay. because they suggested
that I. uh. call up there.

What was her job title?

801
00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:16.820

an executive assistant.

after Miss Nazin's passing.

then why are you asking?

Yes. I have a parole problem.

-No. it was on the floor.
-I'm in violation.

assaulted in Mr. Russell's house.

1036

You know anything about that?

-No.
-Have you ever met Mrs. Russell?

No.

00:59:37.282 --> 00:59:43.705
Her earring is beside his bed
and he borrowed a knife from me.

1056
00:59:43.788 --> 00:59:45.331
and he's been in prison.

1057
00:59:47.625 --> 00:59:51.004
And he was fired from his job.

1058
00:59:52.171 --> 00:59:53.756
His assistant died.

1059
00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:57.802
He threatened me.

1060
00:59:57.885 --> 00:59:59.345
In my home.

1061
01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.015
He beats his child.

1062
01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:03.891
I'm a child psychologist.

1063
01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:07.604
I know how to identify
a child who's in danger.

1064
01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:08.938
who's being abused.

1065
01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:13.610
And I saw Alistair slap Ethan
in my home yesterday.

1066
01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:16.988
Wait-- W--

1067
01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:19.824
Yes. yes. Yesterday.

1068
01:00:22.493 --> 01:00:23.411
I see…

1069
01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:27.123
I see the way
that you're all looking at me.

1070
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.752
I'm not crazy.

1071
01:00:31.836 --> 01:00:34.756
I'm not hallucinating.
Do I seem unreasonable?

1072
01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.467
I have evidence.

1073
01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:42.430
There was that picture
that Jane drew and she signed.

1074
01:00:42.513 --> 01:00:45.725
and there's a photograph
that somebody took of me

1075
01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.060
while I was sleeping.

1076
01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:51.481
Look. it doesn't matter
what you think about me.

1077
01:00:51.564 --> 01:00:55.109
if you approve of me.
if you think that I'm reliable.

1078
01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:59.113
There is a boy in danger in that house.

1079
01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:00.782
Just help him. please.

1080
01:01:00.865 --> 01:01:03.159
[delicate music plays faintly]

1081
01:01:03.242 --> 01:01:04.160
You're a father.

1082
01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:08.998
I would think that you would want
to help a child.

1083
01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:12.335
If my husband were here…

1084
01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:14.671
he would help.

1085
01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:17.465
He would believe me.

1086
01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:20.510
[Norelli] Dr. Fox. your family is dead.

1087
01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:23.680
I don't know how
you can live with yourself

1088
01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:27.684
if you let something happen to a child.

1089
01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:33.481
[Norelli] I'm sorry.
but your family is dead.

1090
01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:38.111
[pulse beating]

1091

1092
01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:42.865
Do you like the mountains. Livy?

1093
01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:45.201
[Olivia] They look like a giant's bed.

1094
01:01:45.284 --> 01:01:47.495
Like a giant.
sleeping under a white blanket.

1095
01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:49.706
[Anna] You're gonna ski in those tomorrow.

1096
01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:52.500
That one looks like a horse.

1097
01:01:52.583 --> 01:01:54.460
What would you name a horse if we got one?

1098
01:01:55.294 --> 01:01:56.337
I'd call him Vixen.

1099
01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:58.131
A vixen is a fox.

1100
01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:01.634
It's a girl fox. sweetheart.

1101
01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:04.971
[Olivia] What would you call
a horse. Mommy?

1102
01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.556
"Of course. of course."

1103
01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.439
It's an old TV show.

1104
01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.403
I can't do it this way.

1105
01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:21.946
Do what?

1106
01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.535
[video game sound effects

1107
01:02:27.618 --> 01:02:28.453
Do what?

1108
01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:32.248
This.

1109
01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:34.792
This happy family vacation.

1110
01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:39.046
You and I spoke in painful detail

1111
01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:42.925
and I thought that we agreed
that we would not ruin Christmas.

1112
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:46.929
And I can't do it anymore. I can't.

1113
01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:50.308
The acting is foolish.

1114
01:02:50.391 --> 01:02:52.143
It doesn't dignify our daughter.

1115
01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.813
You don't care if she gets upset?

1116
01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:58.941
She should be upset. It's upsetting.

1117
01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:04.947
Well. don't blame me
if she's scarred for life.

1118
01:03:06.324 --> 01:03:07.825
I do blame you.

1119
01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:08.951
You're to blame.

[Little]
I talked to your doctor. Dr. Landy.

1157
01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:21.978
And you have had a hell of a time.

1158
01:06:23.437 --> 01:06:26.440
And I think you actually believe
that you met this lady

1159
01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:28.943
just like how you believe
you're talking to your family.

1160
01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:34.240
Your doctor said that your meds
can cause hallucinations.

1161
01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:36.909
Maybe that's okay by you.

1162
01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:40.746

Of course she is.

Of course…

1174
01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:13.320
you are.

1175

I'm really sorry that I involved you in…

that I mixed Ethan up in this.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.691
I understand…

and I'm not sharing that with you.

1190
01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:38.155
[Karl] That's a hard thing to admit.

1191

[voice breaking]
Well. it feels good to say. [sniffles]

1192

And there's some mania. too.

1198
01:09:07.768 --> 01:09:12.273
I just really needed to be
at the center of something.

1199
01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:17.278
I needed a wake-up call.

1200

You got very lucky with that detective.

1201
01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:28.122
You realize how
this could've gone differently.

1202
01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:33.460
I just wanna turn it around.

1203
01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:38.883

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:41.635
Well. that was a mess.

-Is he here?
-No. no.

1206
01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:44.346
He's…

1207
01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:47.266
gonna come back this afternoon and…

1208
01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:50.144
pick up the last of his stuff.

1209
01:09:50.936 --> 01:09:52.897
Which leaves you here alone.

1210
01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.985
You don't think it's paranoid
if I wanna change the locks. do you?

1211
01:09:58.068 --> 01:10:00.112
There's gonna have to be somebody here.

1212
01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:05.117
And then you and I are gonna go back
to three sessions a week.

01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.149
that Ed and I did together.

1232
01:12:43.817 --> 01:12:45.027
After. um…

1233
01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:48.030
Olivia was born.

1234
01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.283
And I'm not gonna be…

1235
01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:54.286
making any. like.
super-significant changes…

1236
01:12:54.828 --> 01:12:55.746
[laughs]

1237
01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:57.706
Super… Super…

1238
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.416
-Fuck. really?
-[camera beeps]

1239
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:04.505
The point of me doing this
is that there's no. um…

1240
01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.091
confusion…

1241
01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:09.593
about. um.

1242
01:13:09.676 --> 01:13:11.553
my soundness of mind.

1243
01:13:16.308 --> 01:13:17.643
My state of mind.

1244
01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:20.896
I-- I--
I especially wanna make sure that. um…

1245
01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:23.649
that you know that David Winters

1246
01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:26.944
has absolutely
nothing to do with my death.

1247
01:13:27.027 --> 01:13:28.904
In fact. I'm waiting for him to come…

1248
01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:32.991
to come and to get his stuff…

1249
01:13:33.784 --> 01:13:35.202
so that I can. um…

1250
01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:40.958
go through with it.

1251
01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:56.181
Go through with it… [scoffs]

1252
01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:00.310
I just wish I could be forgiven.

1253
01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:06.859
I really…

1254
01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:10.237
wish I could just be forgiven.

1255
01:14:14.741 --> 01:14:16.243
I want to go back.

1256
01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.581
I want to do it over.

1257
01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.919
I want to do it different.

1258
01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:32.926
And I can't.

1259
01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:38.140
And I can't.

1260
01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:41.810
[tense music slowly builds]

1261
01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:45.731
[shouts] I can't!

1262
01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:50.694
[suspenseful music playing]

1263
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:13.675
[gasps]

1264
01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:16.386
[suspenseful music continues]

1265
01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:27.481
-[Anna] Punch.
-[camera clicks]

1266
01:15:27.564 --> 01:15:29.775
-Punch. Punch.

1267

[Jane laughing]

1270
01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.955
[chuckles in relief]

1271
01:15:43.747 --> 01:15:44.748
[whispering] Okay.

1272
01:15:46.124 --> 01:15:47.042
[muffled thud]

1273
01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:49.086
Hello?

1274
01:15:49.169 --> 01:15:50.546
[rain pattering]

1275
01:15:59.763 --> 01:16:00.889
Hello?

1276
01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:02.975
[David] Sorry.

1277
01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:07.062
Tried to call. I just need to get
my umbrella and my gloves.

1278
01:16:07.145 --> 01:16:08.480
[Anna] Can you come up?

1279
01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:09.982
Uh. just for a moment.

1280
01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:11.275
[David] I'm soaking wet.

1281
01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:13.193
I had a long day
and it's not about to end soon.

1282
01:16:13.277 --> 01:16:15.362
[Anna] Please. It'll just take a minute.

1283
01:16:15.445 --> 01:16:17.447
[footsteps walking up stairs]

1284
01:16:27.874 --> 01:16:28.792
[Anna gasps]

1285
01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:31.211
Thank you.

1286
01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:32.296
For what?

1287
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.214
[chuckles softly]

1288
01:16:36.383 --> 01:16:38.552
I wanna show you…

1289
01:16:38.635 --> 01:16:39.595
a picture.

1290
01:16:44.808 --> 01:16:45.976
[David sighs]

1291
01:16:53.317 --> 01:16:54.693
The face in the wine glass.

1292
01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:57.779
Yeah. I see it.

1293
01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:00.907
[chuckles softly]

1294
01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:02.909
That is the woman that I saw murdered.

1295
01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:05.078
She said that her name was Jane Russell!

1296
01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:12.669
Her name is Katie.

1297
01:17:13.253 --> 01:17:14.630
[tense music plays]

1298
01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:15.547
What?

1299
01:17:16.506 --> 01:17:18.008
Ethan. the son…

1300
01:17:18.925 --> 01:17:20.135
she is the birth mother.

1301
01:17:23.096 --> 01:17:24.556
You spent the night with her.

1302
01:17:25.098 --> 01:17:26.725
Wednesday. One night.

1303
01:17:27.267 --> 01:17:29.853
She was a total disaster.
Why do you think I bailed?

1304
01:17:30.437 --> 01:17:33.106
I spent the night on a couch in Astoria
on Thursday night

1305
01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:34.816
just so I don't have
to run into her again.

1306
01:17:35.525 --> 01:17:38.153
She ran away on him
when she was eight months pregnant.

1307
01:17:38.236 --> 01:17:40.822
Disappeared.
Alistair spent two years chasing her down…

1308
01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:42.574
and found her in some Oregon meth commune.

1309
01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.660
He took the boy. she went to prison.

1310
01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:46.912
-See how I changed the subject on you?
-I did.

1311
01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:49.456
You don't know who you're fooling with.
[laughing]

1312
01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:53.627
They told you this?

1313
01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:56.129
She did. She wouldn't shut up.

1314
01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:59.675
They've been hiding from her for years.
She found out they were living in Boston.

1315
01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:01.385
He's been paying her to stay away.

1316
01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:04.471
Why did she tell me
her name is Jane Russell?

1317
01:18:04.554 --> 01:18:05.597
You're Jane Russell.

1318
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:06.723
You're Jane Russell.

1319
01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:08.892
What makes you say that?

1320
01:18:08.975 --> 01:18:11.478
[Anna] Your son came by. Ethan.

1321
01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:14.898
I saw her murdered.

1322
01:18:16.274 --> 01:18:17.776
[thunder rumbles]

1323
01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:19.611
Whatever you say. Anna.

1324
01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:20.612
Yeah.

1325
01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:24.616
I showed you… the picture.

1326
01:18:25.617 --> 01:18:28.036
Yeah. looking very much alive.

1327
01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.329
She's real.

1328
01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:33.834
And I need you
to go to the police with me.

1329
01:18:34.334 --> 01:18:35.627
[sighs]

1330
01:18:38.171 --> 01:18:39.297
No.

1331
01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:40.590
No. no.

1332
01:18:40.674 --> 01:18:41.550
David!

1333
01:18:42.342 --> 01:18:44.553
You can't just run away from this!

1334
01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:46.430
[David] Watch me.

1335
01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:48.223
Oh. shit! Please. David!

1336
01:18:49.474 --> 01:18:50.892

David?

[faint creaking]

Oh. my God!

1349
01:19:36.563 --> 01:19:38.398
You know what's so great about this?

1350
01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:41.735
Everyone thinks
I'm in New Hampshire right now.

1351
01:19:41.818 --> 01:19:45.113
They call it a wilderness program
but it's really a prison.

1352
01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.407
I was supposed to go last month

1353
01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:49.993
but they had a fire or something.
[chuckles softly]

1354
01:19:52.662 --> 01:19:54.915
We never had a chance to say goodbye.

1355
01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:56.666
David!

1356
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:59.961
The trick is to run away
before you get there.

1357
01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:01.713
What did you do? [loudly] David!

1358
01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:02.839
He's dead.

1359
01:20:03.673 --> 01:20:04.674
You killed him.

1360
01:20:04.758 --> 01:20:06.927
-No. What?
-It's your knife.

1361
01:20:07.719 --> 01:20:10.597
Your house. Just the two of you.

1362
01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.849
What did you do?

1363
01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:14.351
He deserved it.

1364
01:20:14.434 --> 01:20:17.229
He slept with my mom
and got her all pissed off.

1365
01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.563
And then threw her out.

1366
01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.023
[Anna whimpering]

1367
01:20:20.106 --> 01:20:22.901
She might have just gone away
if he'd left her alone.

1368
01:20:23.902 --> 01:20:25.821
Then maybe none of this
would have happened.

1369
01:20:27.447 --> 01:20:29.324
-Don't scream. Anna.
-[gasps]

1370
01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.993
That'll just be bad for everyone.

1371

[shuddering]

1372
01:20:34.287 --> 01:20:36.289
[breathes deeply]

1373
01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:37.332
Take a deep breath.

[gasping]

1375
01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:41.002
That's what they're always
telling me to do.

1376
01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:43.046
Self-management coping skills.

-Why are you so freaked out?
-[shuddering]

1383
01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:58.937
You're killing yourself anyway. right?

1384
01:21:00.897 --> 01:21:02.774
[tense music playing]

1385
01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.317
No. No.

1386
01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:09.030
I thought it was a really nice video.

1387
01:21:11.074 --> 01:21:13.034
How did you get into my house?

1388
01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:17.122
'Cause you're so vigilant about your keys.

1389
01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:19.332
And sober. Right.

1390
01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:23.003
I've been in here all week.

1391
01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:25.672
You killed your mother.

1392
01:21:32.178 --> 01:21:33.930
That bothers you. right?

1393
01:21:35.473 --> 01:21:36.641
You feel for her?

1394
01:21:38.476 --> 01:21:39.561
You and Katie…

1395
01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:42.230
one job to do.

1396
01:21:43.523 --> 01:21:45.692
One fucking thing.

1397
01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:50.280
Take care of your family. right?

1398
01:21:51.615 --> 01:21:52.616
Both of you.

1399
01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:55.118
And what do you do?

1400
01:21:56.828 --> 01:21:59.831
The real estate lady
who sold my dad the house.

1401
01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:03.209
she talked about you and what happened.

1402
01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:05.921
And I couldn't stop thinking

1403
01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:09.174
what a perfect next person
you were for me.

1404
01:22:10.717 --> 01:22:12.844
I knew exactly what you would like.

1405
01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:17.098
Is that a talent or a skill…

1406
01:22:17.849 --> 01:22:18.850
to know that…

1407
01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:22.562
in your professional opinion?

1408
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:28.318
Okay. see? Now you don't like me anymore.

1409
01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:31.321
Is that what happened in Boston…

1410
01:22:32.405 --> 01:22:34.658
with you and Pam? She got sick of you?

1411
01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:38.411
Pam liked everything I did.

1412
01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:40.705
You don't seem very sure about it.

1413
01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:42.791
She was just a place to start.

1414
01:22:43.708 --> 01:22:45.001
I'm still figuring things out.

1415
01:22:45.085 --> 01:22:47.545

I have so many choices. right?

1418
01:22:53.843 --> 01:22:56.137
What do I wanna be when I grow up?

1419
01:22:57.681 --> 01:23:00.642
I know I like being there
when it happens. feeling it.

1420
01:23:04.854 --> 01:23:07.857
Pam took about five minutes to die
after she hit the ground.

1421
01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:12.404
If you hadn't found that picture of Katie.

1422
01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:15.073
I was just gonna come in at the very end

1423
01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:16.324
and say goodbye.

1424
01:23:17.867 --> 01:23:19.953
