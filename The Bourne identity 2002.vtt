2
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.620
What the hell
are you doing to me?

3
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.130
What are you doing?

4
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.710
Goddamn it! Where am I?

5
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.300
A boat! A fishing boat.
You were in the water.

6
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.640
We pulled you out.

7
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.010
What water?

8
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.600
You were shot. See?
There are the bullets.

9
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.520
Look. there is a number
for a bank.
Why was it in your hip?

10
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.980
My hip?

11
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.650
Why was it in your hip?
My hip.

12
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.440
Yeah. in your hip
under the skin.

13
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.860
Oh. God.

14
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.150
What are you gonna
do with me?

15
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.990
You need to rest.
Wait.

16
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.780
Please. Lie down.

17
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.910
I'm a friend.
I'm your friend.

18
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.040
My name is Giancarlo.

19
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.080
Who are you?

20
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.920
What's your name?

21
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.210
What's your name?

22
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.050
I don't know.

23
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.760
Oh. God.
Lie down.

24
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.960
It's been confirmed. sir.
Mission failed.

25
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.620
If you want to eat.
you'd better
get in there.

26
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.000
You know.
based on
these charts.

27
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.460
I think I may have been
closer to the coast.

28
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.290
What is this?
You tie these knots?

29
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.300
So. it starts to
come back?

30
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.880
No. it doesn't
start to come back.

31
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.260
The knot's like
everything else. I just found
the rope and I did it.

32
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.640
Same way I can read.

33
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.760
I can write.
I can add. subtract.
I can make coffee.

34
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.810
I can shuffle cards.
set up a chessboard.

35
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.140
Yes. it will come back.

36
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.520
No. it's not coming back.
goddamn it!
That's the point!

37
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.690
I'm down here
looking through this.
all this shit!

38
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.690
For two weeks I'm down here.

39
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.900
It's not working.
I don't even know
what to look for.

40
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.830
You need to rest.
It will come back.

41
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.500
What if it
doesn't come back?

42
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.250
We get in there tomorrow.
I don't even have a name.

43
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.790
It's not much.
but it should get you
to Switzerland.

44
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.710
Thank you.

45
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.650
All right.

46
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.240
No. I don't...

47
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.740
I don't have any papers.
I lost my...

48
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:42.530
<i>These people
have threatened my family.
My babies.</i>

49
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.070
<i>So l'm telling you.
when the evidence is clear.</i>

50
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.870
<i>l will have a nice story
for you to read about.</i>

51
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.120
<i>And all my friends out there.
you will read
about yourselves.</i>

52
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.870
<i>'Cause if you want to
play this game</i>

53
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.130
<i>after l have been reasonable.
l will show you.</i>

54
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.300
That's Nykwana Wombosi
speaking in Paris
the day before yesterday.

55
00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.170
He was an irritation
before he took power.
he was a problem

56
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.850
when he was in power.
and he's been a disaster
for us in exile.

57
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.470
He's writing a book
about the Agency's
history in Africa.

58
00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.060
He's going to name names.

59
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.310
It's basically a shakedown.
He's demanding
the Agency's help.

60
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.110
He wants us to put him
back in power
in six months. or else.

61
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.740
This interview. and
I'll make the tape available
to whoever wants it.

62
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.450
he goes on to claim
that he's just survived
an assassination attempt.

63
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.990
He says it's us.
He says he's got proof.

64
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.870
The Director wants to know
if there's any shred of truth

65
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.660
in this accusation.

66
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.750
I've already assured him
there's nobody that reckless
on my senior staff.

67
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.050
I was recalling
a conversation we had
some time ago.

68
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.890
Talking about
Treadstone.

69
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.770
I seem to remember
Wombosi's name
might have come up.

70
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.900
I'm not sure
what we're talking about.

71
00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.690
Someone tried
to take him out.

72
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.690
Tried and failed.

73
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.360
Was this Treadstone?

74
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.820
You're asking me
a direct question?

75
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.450
Yes.

76
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.120
I thought you were
never gonna do that.

77
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.700
What happened?

78
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:21.340
Well. we lost
the communication
with our man.

79
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.130
This was almost
two weeks ago.

80
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.670
We've been working
around the clock.
The whole unit.

81
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.880
We've been
sleeping down there.

82
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.140
We're doing
everything we can.

83
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.260
And you don't
let me know this?

84
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.140
You never wanted
to before.

85
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.180
You never made
a mistake before.

86
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.050
Yes. I'm here about
a numbered account.

87
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.180
If you just enter
your account number here.

88
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.020
I'll direct you to
an appropriate officer.

89
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.350
My name is Jason Bourne.

90
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.900
I live in Paris.

91
00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.560
<i>Yes. in Paris.</i>

92
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.520
<i>Do you have the number
for a Jason Bourne?</i>

93
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.270
<i>Yes. sir.
Would you like me to
connect you?</i>

94
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.730
Yes. please.

95
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.620
<i>This is 46 99 03 84.</i>

96
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.950
<i>Leave a message at the beep.</i>

97
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.350
I'm an American.

98
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.520
Okay.

99
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:55.400
Hold it.

100
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.320
Wait. You have
no jurisdiction here.

101
00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.190
Hold it there.
Okay?

102
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.200
No.

103
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.830
Excuse me. No.
This is not my
current address. okay?

104
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.870
This was my address
until two days ago.

105
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.790
when I started
standing in line.

106
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.080
Now I lose
my apartment. okay?

107
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.000
That means
no address. no phone.
no money. no time.

108
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.550
And I still have no visa!
Miss Kreutz. please.

109
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.710
I'll have to ask you
to keep your voice down.

110
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.050
Excuse me. I mean.
but where's the guy
that I talked to last week?

111
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.600
Every week it's a new person.
How am I supposed to...

112
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.310
I don't know who
you saw last week.

113
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.310
Well. let me help you.
I'm sure I have it.
Wait. Hang on.

114
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.480
Could I have your
attention for a moment?

115
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.650
I have it right here.
Just look at it.

116
00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.980
You staged an effort
to circumvent the immigration
laws of the United States.

117
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.110
This is
a student visa now.

118
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.360
It's not about
a green card anymore.
It's completely different.

119
00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.570
It's not a menu.
Miss Kreutz.
You don't...

120
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.410
I brought
all this proof.

121
00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:51.790
<i>Potential suspect...</i>

122
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:54.160
<i>Help in assault incident.</i>

123
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.920
You! Red bag!
The red bag!

124
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.880
Stop right there!
Put your hands up!

125
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.550
I'm on it.

126
00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:52.260
<i>Move it! Now! Now! Move!</i>

127
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:59.100
<i>Alpha Unit. take
the back stairs and
work your way up. Bravo...</i>

128
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.900
<i>Move in! Move in!</i>

129
00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.950
Okay. clear!

130
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.080
<i>The suspect is...</i>

131
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.410
<i>Bravo Unit.
Moving up staircase.
Proceeding to second floor.</i>

132
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.290
<i>Alpha Unit. you're clear.</i>

133
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.300
<i>Move! Move!</i>

134
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.520
<i>Alpha. Bravo Units.
target may have a radio.</i>

135
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.640
<i>Go to Code 77. Over.</i>

136
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.690
<i>Code 77. copy.</i>

137
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.520
The floor! Down!

138
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.320
Clear!

139
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.700
Go. Move up. Move up.

140
00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:20.470
He's in Zurich now?
Right now?

141
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.140
Yes.
It just came in.

142
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.350
But they're sure?
They're sure it's him?

143
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.640
Yes. He went
to the bank.

144
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:27.520
Our source at the bank.
that's who called.

145
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.650
Come on.

146
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.020
But he's got to assume
we're watching
the bank. right?

147
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.190
I don't know. Come on.

148
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.610
I mean.
he cleaned out the box.

149
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.700
He left a gun.
What does that mean?

150
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.530
I said I don't know!

151
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.910
I liked it better
when I thought
he was dead.

152
00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.260
What are you looking at?

153
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.050
I heard you inside.

154
00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.140
What?

155
00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.510
The consulate.
I heard you talking.

156
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.930
I thought maybe
we could
help each other.

157
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.390
How's that?

158
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.940
You need money.
I need a ride
out of here.

159
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.980
I'm not running
a car service.
Thank you.

160
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.610
I'll give you $10.000
to drive me to Paris.

161
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.120
What is this. a joke?
Some kind of scam?

162
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.000
No. it's no scam.

163
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.380
And I'll give you
another $10.000
when we get there.

164
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.000
Jesus.

165
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:40.550
Is that for you?

166
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.970
Look. You drive. I pay.
It's that simple.

167
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.690
I got enough
trouble. okay?

168
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.190
Okay.

169
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.270
Can I have
my money back?

170
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.000
All right. go.
Keep going.

171
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.580
Go.

172
00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.340
There! Wait!

173
00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.670
No. it's got to be
near the end.

174
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.800
Come on. folks!
We caught a break here!
Let's go!

175
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.010
Okay. I'm up.

176
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:23.140
We're getting grids.
Airline. train.
hotels. hospitals.

177
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.550
Who's getting
the address? The street?

178
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.640
Gemensheidt.

179
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.890
Here we go. I got it.
I think I got it.

180
00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.310
Is it him?

181
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.890
Unreal.

182
00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.650
This is 38 minutes ago.

183
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.320
Zurich police are looking
for an American
carrying a red bank bag.

184
00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.240
He just tore up the embassy
and he put two cops
in the hospital last night.

185
00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.990
Get everybody up.
Do it now.
I want them all activated.

186
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.910
Wait. All of them?
At the same time?

187
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:51.620
You heard me.
I want Bourne in a body bag
by sundown.

188
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.540
All right. let's get
a map up here! Come on. folks!
Let's work it!

189
00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.800
The grids
are getting updated.

190
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.920
<i>...which was
fine with me
because l was ready.</i>

191
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.590
<i>After six months in Amsterdam.
you're not sure</i>

192
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.800
<i>if you've been there
20 minutes or years.
if you know what l mean.</i>

193
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.350
So I went. And I took
all the money I had.
And I went in with friends.

194
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:34.980
and we took over this
cool surf shop outside
Biarritz. right by the water.

195
00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.600
It was amazing.

196
00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:41.150
It was just amazing
for about three months.
until it turned out that this

197
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:45.740
jerk who had fronted us
the lease was actually
shining everyone on and...

198
00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:53.700
And what?

199
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.460
What do you mean "what"?
Listen to me.

200
00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.130
I've been speed-talking
for about 60 kilometers now.

201
00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.460
I talk when I'm nervous.
I mean. I talk like this
when I'm nervous.

202
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.710
I'm gonna shut up now.

203
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.220
No. don't do that.

204
00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:10.220
I haven't talked to
anybody in a while.

205
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.890
Yeah. but we're not
talking. I'm talking.

206
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.810
You've said.
like. 10 words
since we left Zurich.

207
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.520
Well. listening to you.
it's relaxing.

208
00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.400
I haven't
slept in a while and...

209
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.110
And I've had
this headache.

210
00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:29.530
It's like a constant thing
inside my head

211
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:33.080
and it's just starting
to move to the background.

212
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.700
so keep going.

213
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.120
Really. if you want.
please keep talking.

214
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:42.290
Okay.

215
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:45.920
What kind of music
do you like?

216
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.970
What do you like?
Come on.

217
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.220
You know what?
Never mind.

218
00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.760
No. it's fine.
Tell me.

219
00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.560
What do you want to
listen to?

220
00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.730
I don't know.

221
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:03.110
Come on. it's not that hard.
What do you like? Tell me.

222
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.650
I don't know.

223
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.620
Who pays $20.000
for a ride to Paris?

224
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.050
Fuck it.

225
00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:33.550
I can't remember
anything that happened
before two weeks ago.

226
00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.510
Lucky you.
No. I'm serious.

227
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.770
I don't know who I am.
I don't know
where I'm going.

228
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:42.480
None of it.

229
00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:44.350
What? Like amnesia?

230
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.650
Yes.

231
00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.320
Amnesia.
Yes.

232
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:54.620
Right.

233
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.870
And that's the best angle
of the courtyard?

234
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.290
That's the only angle.

235
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.750
What do they have
of the streets?
Or. you know. the area?

236
00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.090
They must have
something.

237
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.380
Hang on.

238
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.010
What is he doing?

239
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.060
Is it a game?
Is he warning us?
Is it a threat?

240
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:22.850
Sir? Look at this.

241
00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:25.770
What's that?

242
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.730
It's an angle of the street.
a sort of alley.

243
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.400
Just enhance it.

244
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.490
Now. who the hell is that?

245
00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.910
Marie Helena Kreutz.

246
00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:43.710
She's 26.
born outside Hanover.
Her father was a welder.

247
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.290
He died in '87.

248
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.080
We still don't
have the mother.

249
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.130
The grandmother.
she's still in Hanover.

250
00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:52.710
It looks like she's
the anchor for this little
domestic disaster.

251
00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.420
And there's a stepbrother.

252
00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.510
It's tough.
The girl's a gypsy.

253
00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:01.100
I mean. she pops up
on the grid here and there.
but it's chaotic at best.

254
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.640
She paid some electric bills
in Spain. '95.

255
00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:06.770
Had a phone in her name
for three months
in Belgium. '96.

256
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.440
No taxes. no credit.

257
00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.360
I don't like her.
I want to go deep.

258
00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.990
Get a phone log for Granny
and the half-brother.

259
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.240
Anybody we can cross-file.

260
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.450
I want to know every place
she's slept in
the past six years.

261
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.250
Have Paris get these out
in the field.

262
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.110
<i>l'm not making this up.</i>

263
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.110
These are real.

264
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.200
Okay.

265
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:09.000
Who has
a safety deposit box
full of

266
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.670
money and six passports
and a gun?

267
00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.130
Who has
a bank account number
in their hip?

268
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:24.640
I come in here. and the
first thing I'm doing is
I'm catching the sightlines

269
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.020
and looking for
an exit.

270
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.310
I see the exit sign. too.
I'm not worried.

271
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.060
I mean. you were shot.

272
00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:34.820
People do all kinds of
weird and amazing stuff
when they are scared.

273
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.660
I can tell you
the license plate numbers
of all six cars outside.

274
00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:47.620
I can tell you
that our waitress
is left-handed

275
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:52.000
and the guy sitting at
the counter weighs 215 pounds
and can handle himself.

276
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.840
I know the best place to look
for a gun is the cab
of the gray truck outside.

277
00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:00.340
And at this altitude. I can
run flat out for a half-mile
before my hands start shaking.

278
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:05.430
Now why would I know that?

279
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.270
How can I know that
and not know who I am?

280
00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.060
Hey.

281
00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:57.900
I slept.

282
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.490
I can't believe it.

283
00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:02.740
Yeah. well.
you were tired.

284
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.160
I haven't slept.

285
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.410
Oh. here. For $20.000.
I like to
throw in breakfast.

286
00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.370
Did you stop for gas?

287
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.250
You were
pretty out of it.

288
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:24.760
So. do you think
there's. like.
a family waiting for you?

289
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:28.010
I don't know.

290
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.560
I've thought about it.

291
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.690
Is that it?

292
00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.360
104.

293
00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:46.320
Yeah. that's the address.
No. no. keep going.
Keep going.

294
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.030
Okay. Where?

295
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.990
Just take a left.
Pull in over here.

296
00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.160
Okay.

297
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.640
So. this is it. right?

298
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.300
Yeah. I guess.

299
00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:13.850
God. I don't recognize
any of this.

300
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.810
Okay. I should go.

301
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:21.320
Jason?

302
00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.700
Oh. God.
The money. Right.

303
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.530
Yeah.

304
00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.280
Here.

305
00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:32.160
Thank you. Okay.

306
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.960
Thanks for the ride.

307
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.830
Anytime.

308
00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.260
Well. you could come up.
I mean. or you can wait here.

309
00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.430
I can go check it out.
But you could wait.

310
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:49.840
Oh. no. no.

311
00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.470
You could wait.

312
00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.980
With you. you would
probably just forget about me
if I stayed here.

313
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:59.850
How could
I forget about you?

314
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.570
You're the only person I know.

315
00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.780
Yeah. That's true.

316
00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.880
I guess you're not home.

317
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.420
Hello?

318
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.070
Are you sure
this is all yours?

319
00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.230
I guess.

320
00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.880
This is my kitchen.

321
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.490
Any clues?

322
00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.490
I think I'm in
the shipping business.

323
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.740
So it's all coming back?

324
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.130
Do you mind
if I use the bathroom?

325
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:28.290
Sure.

326
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:30.300
Okay.

327
00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.990
Yeah. Hello? Hello?

328
00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.330
<i>Yes. sir. Hotel Regina. Paris.
How may l direct your call?</i>

329
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:01.620
Yeah. you're in Paris?

330
00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.790
<i>Yes. sir.</i>

331
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:06.250
I'm looking for
a guest there.

332
00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.130
A Jason Bourne.

333
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:09.380
<i>One moment. please.</i>

334
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.800
Thank you.

335
00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.550
<i>l'm afraid l have
no one by that name
registered. sir.</i>

336
00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:22.310
Okay. Thank you.

337
00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.310
Wait! No. no.
Are you there? Hello?

338
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:26.390
<i>Sir?</i>

339
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.400
Can you check
another name for me.
please?

340
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:31.690
Here. bear with me
one second.

341
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.860
John Michael Kane.
Kane with a "K."

342
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:39.280
<i>One moment. sir.</i>

343
00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:40.700
Thank you.

344
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.250
<i>You call about
Monsieur Kane?
John Michael Kane?</i>

345
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.050
Yeah. that's right.

346
00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.010
<i>You are a friend of his?</i>

347
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:57.180
Yeah.

348
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.100
<i>l have some
very bad news
for you. sir.</i>

349
00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.640
<i>l'm sorry
to tell you this.</i>

350
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.640
<i>but Monsieur Kane
has passed away
almost two weeks ago.</i>

351
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.770
<i>There was an accident.
On the motorway.</i>

352
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.360
<i>Apparently.
he was killed instantly.</i>

353
00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.440
<i>Really. l'm terribly sorry
to be the one
to tell you this.</i>

354
00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:20.820
<i>When they came for his things.
it was made known
for us. you see?</i>

355
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:22.410
Who came?

356
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:23.910
<i>His brother.</i>

357
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:28.290
Did his brother leave a number
or a way
to get in touch with him?

358
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:29.790
<i>l think not.</i>

359
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:32.630
<i>No. l'm sorry.</i>

360
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.990
Jason?
There's no hot water.

361
00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:59.200
It's freezing.

362
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:02.820
I'll go try the water
in the kitchen.

363
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:07.120
Why don't you just
stay in the bathroom?
I'll see if I can get it hot.

364
00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.000
Yeah. it's really cold
in here. too.

365
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.180
The water is still cold.

366
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:32.060
Yeah. it's cold
in the kitchen. too.
I got it running. though.

367
00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.610
So...

368
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:44.660
What?

369
00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:47.870
Nothing.

370
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.330
Are you okay?

371
00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:52.670
Mmm-hmm.

372
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:53.880
Yeah.

373
00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:08.560
What is it?

374
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:11.520
Something wrong?

375
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.760
Jason!

376
00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.080
Open that. Open that.
Tell me what's inside.

377
00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.580
Who are you?

378
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:58.670
Who are you?

379
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.880
Who are you?

380
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:06.880
Oh. my God.

381
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:10.760
God.

382
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.970
Answer me!
Who are you?

383
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:14.680
He's got my picture!

384
00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:15.850
All right.
Just hang on.

385
00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:17.230
This is Zurich.
It's yesterday!

386
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:18.310
No. no. don't...

387
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.940
I don't know.
Where did you get this?

388
00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:21.270
Hang on.
Stay there.

389
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.610
How did you
get my picture?

390
00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:24.730
Where did you
get this from?

391
00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.650
How did you get my...
My God!

392
00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.570
I'll do this!
You stay there.
Stay there!

393
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.260
Where are your shoes?
Get your shoes.

394
00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.180
Sure. Yeah. sure.

395
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:53.970
He went out the window.
Why would someone do that?

396
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.640
We can't stay here.
It's not safe.

397
00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:00.390
I can get us out of here.
but we got to go.
We got to go right now.

398
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:05.780
Okay. look.
you can wait.

399
00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:08.320
You can wait for the cops.
It's okay.

400
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.820
You just wait for them
to get here.
But I can't. I got to go.

401
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.910
Marie?

402
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.250
Marie?

403
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.510
Quiet. Be quiet.

404
00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.980
Don't look.

405
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:56.030
<i>Code in.</i>

406
00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:58.490
Alpha 37509.

407
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:01.960
Yeah.

408
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:09.090
Hang on.

409
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:11.340
Bourne. He went to Paris.
He went to the apartment.

410
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.050
We got him? Tell me.

411
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.970
<i>He killed our man.</i>

412
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:16.760
<i>What? In the apartment?
Yeah.</i>

413
00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.140
<i>Well. you got to
clean that up.</i>

414
00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.560
No. I can't clean it up.

415
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.640
<i>There's a body in the street.
So?</i>

416
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:24.560
There's police.
This is Paris.

417
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:27.690
<i>Put up the scanners.
Get as much radio
information as you can.</i>

418
00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:27.730
<i>Put up the scanners.
Get as much radio
information as you can.</i>

419
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.650
Okay. you stay here.

420
00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:36.120
I'm gonna go find a place
for this money.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

421
00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.450
Hey. I told you
to stay in the car.

422
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:11.170
Jesus Christ.
I told you to
stay in the car.

423
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:15.340
I needed a drink.
I didn't think you would
come back anyway.

424
00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.260
Look. you got to
go to the cops.

425
00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.720
Right now.
You got to go before
this gets any worse.

426
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.600
By myself?
It's gonna be okay.

427
00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.600
You're gonna take
my passport. okay?
You show this to them.

428
00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.850
You have that picture.
you have the $20.000.

429
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.850
You tell them everything
that happened.
They'll believe you.

430
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.520
They have to believe you.

431
00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:38.700
Marie. you can't
just sit here.
It's not safe here.

432
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:40.870
Safe? This is from
inside the embassy.

433
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:42.450
Who can do this?
This is from yesterday.

434
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:43.700
I don't know.

435
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:45.490
How can they know
we're together?

436
00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:47.750
I'm trying to do
the right thing for you.

437
00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:49.670
That's all I'm trying to do.
Right?

438
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:52.330
How will you make this right
by sending me there alone?

439
00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:54.920
You think I want you
to go to the cops?
That's good?

440
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:56.880
You want to go. fine.
If you go. I run!

441
00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:58.050
You go tell them
what happened!

442
00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:59.760
I don't know
what happened!

443
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.180
I don't know
who this guy was
or about that picture!

444
00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.140
I don't know who I am!

445
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.020
Look. I'm...

446
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.610
You act like
I'm trying to burn you.

447
00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:15.230
I'm trying
to do the right thing.

448
00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.440
Nobody does the right thing.

449
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.500
Look. I can't run with you.
I can't.

450
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:33.080
We run. I got to
live like this. I got to...

451
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:35.040
I don't even know
who I'm hiding from.

452
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.090
These people
know who I am.

453
00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:40.590
Yeah. I got to stay here.
I got to figure this out.

454
00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.340
So figure it out.

455
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:02.570
You take care
of this car?

456
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:04.070
What do you mean?

457
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.950
The tires felt
a little splashy
on the way over here.

458
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.330
It pulls a little
to the right.

459
00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:32.560
Last chance. Marie.

460
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:57.270
So...

461
00:53:57.810 --> 00:53:59.980
What?
We got a bump coming up.

462
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:36.480
Turn your head away.
Turn your head away.

463
00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:49.650
We can never come back
to this car.

464
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.900
You understand?

465
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:53.860
Okay. we're gonna
clean it out.

466
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:56.160
and I'll wipe it down.
and we walk away.

467
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.830
That's it.
Okay.

468
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:01.790
Okay. And I'll find a place
for us to rest.
And I got to think.

469
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:04.040
Do you have a hat or
a scarf or something?

470
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.080
For my hair?

471
00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:06.540
Yeah. Just until
we can change it.

472
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:08.710
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

473
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:09.920
Okay.

474
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:49.290
It's not him.

475
00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:14.900
<i>What do you have?</i>

476
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.280
<i>Wombosi went to the morgue.</i>

477
00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.360
<i>He saw the body.
He didn't buy it.</i>

478
00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.410
Where is he now?

479
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:25.290
<i>l told you.
l'm not staffed for this.</i>

480
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:27.580
<i>Where is he now?
Right now!
Where's Wombosi?</i>

481
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:28.960
<i>They were
leaving the morgue.</i>

482
00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.580
They just left.

483
00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:39.430
Sir. what do you
want to do?

484
01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.880
I need to
get the bottle.

485
01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:13.010
Hey.

486
01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.490
You already
cleaned the room?

487
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:29.530
I wiped the whole place down
for fingerprints.

488
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:36.500
Can I walk around
or is it gonna leave
any footprints?

489
01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.470
You can walk around.
It's no problem.

490
01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.510
But we'll just keep track
of everything we touch.

491
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.890
I think it's better
if we leave a room.

492
01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:53.390
that we're not gonna
leave a trail.

493
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:54.890
Why? Where are we going?

494
01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:57.810
I need to go to
the hotel where
John Michael Kane stayed.

495
01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:59.390
The Hotel Regina.

496
01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.020
If I was him.
then they're gonna
have some records.

497
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.280
We need that hotel bill.

498
01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.490
Okay.

499
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:10.570
It gets slightly
complicated. though.

500
01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.070
Because you're dead.

501
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:16.120
Right.

502
01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.040
Sir. please.

503
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:24.210
If they want war.
then we'll
give them war.

504
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.710
If they want to kill me.
they better kill me
the first time.

505
01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.180
They better kill me dead.
They better kill me
when I'm in my sleep.

506
01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.600
Nykwana. listen to me.
We need these people.

507
01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.310
It's hard enough
getting people
that we know to help us.

508
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:37.930
We need to be careful.

509
01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.100
We?

510
01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:40.770
No. you.

511
01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:43.400
You need to bring me back
that bastard kid's head.

512
01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.070
put it in the front
of this house.

513
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:47.230
and show them the war
we're fighting.

514
01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.650
But that is precisely...

515
01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.410
Nykwana!

516
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.220
We'll give the watch
a reference check
before we go.

517
01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:13.130
Okay.

518
01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.890
What's the
pay phone number?

519
01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:20.520
616-2468.

520
01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.770
Exits?

521
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.270
There's three.

522
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.610
Service at the back.
side goes to the street
past the shops.

523
01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.690
front is the best.

524
01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.860
If I think I'm being followed.
I walk out with the bag
over my right shoulder.

525
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:35.410
And if there's no taxi?

526
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:39.120
I keep on walking.
don't look back
until you make contact.

527
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.290
What?

528
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:49.460
We need this. right?

529
01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:53.470
Okay.

530
01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:06.560
<i>l need distances.</i>

531
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:09.400
<i>You walk in. you pick a spot.
Some midpoint in the lobby.</i>

532
01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:13.150
<i>l want you to count your steps
to that spot.
and then remember that number.</i>

533
01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.740
<i>Because after l call you.
l can get you moving.</i>

534
01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.320
<i>You understand?</i>

535
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:19.240
<i>l also need a head count.</i>

536
01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:22.290
<i>How many people
from when you walk in
until you get to the desk.</i>

537
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:25.210
<i>How many hotel employees
are there?
And obviously security.</i>

538
01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:27.500
<i>And it might not be that easy
to see who they are.</i>

539
01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:31.090
<i>So l'll call you.
you give me the layout.
and we'll take it from there.</i>

540
01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:36.840
<i>Regina.</i>

541
01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:59.320
What happened?
I...

542
01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:00.990
Did something
go wrong? What...

543
01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.410
I've got the records.

544
01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:06.460
He. this guy
at the front desk
was smiling at me.

545
01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.540
So I thought. you know.
all this trouble.

546
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:10.790
maybe it's easier to
just ask for them.

547
01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.340
You have the bill?

548
01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:13.840
He made me a photocopy.

549
01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:16.880
You just asked for it?

550
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:21.550
I said I was
Mr. Kane's
personal assistant.

551
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:24.350
Oh.

552
01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:28.560
Okay.
That's good thinking.

553
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:39.860
Sir. can I...
No.

554
01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:47.290
Wombosi was assassinated
in his house
in the middle of Paris.

555
01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:50.000
Yeah. we just heard.

556
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:53.750
It's him. It's Bourne.
We're almost positive.

557
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.340
He had an assignment.
He failed.

558
01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:59.380
He obviously felt compelled
to finish the task.

559
01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:00.510
Jesus.

560
01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:02.600
We think he'll come back
in now.

561
01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:04.510
I mean. it's routine.

562
01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.430
It's like
behavioral software.

563
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:10.310
He's following a protocol.

564
01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:14.690
Now that he's completed
the mission. we think
he'll come back in.

565
01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.940
They always do.

566
01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:18.860
When?

567
01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:21.490
How long
till he checks in?

568
01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.530
Twenty-four hours.
Twenty-four hours?

569
01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:27.290
Yeah. it's usually
something like that.

570
01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.500
Then what?

571
01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:33.000
I told you
we'd clean this up.

572
01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:34.750
It will be clean.

573
01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:42.430
Yeah. I understand
you're a dive shop.
but where are you located?

574
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:45.350
Marseilles?

575
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.080
What specifically does
your company supply?

576
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:15.290
<i>l am sorry.
What did you say
your name was. monsieur?</i>

577
01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.440
What?

578
01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.230
Paris police
found the vehicle.

579
01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.290
<i>You've reached the office
of Simon Rawlins</i>

580
01:08:53.370 --> 01:08:55.880
<i>at Alliance Security.
Maritime Division.</i>

581
01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:59.920
<i>Paris office hours are
from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.</i>

582
01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.220
I got a lead in Paris.

583
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:05.260
The rest were Marseilles.
and two out in Southampton.

584
01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.340
In Paris?
It's what?

585
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:07.970
Alliance Security.
Simon Rawlins.

586
01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.220
I got a machine.

587
01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:36.040
Mr. Kane?

588
01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.380
Mr. Kane!

589
01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:40.840
How are you?

590
01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.380
I'm good. I'm good.
How are you?

591
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.760
Mr. Kane. Come right in.
Please have a seat.

592
01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:52.180
Thank you.

593
01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.270
So. this is the
Palmer Johnson tri-deck.

594
01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:59.940
I'm assuming you're still
in the market.
It's still the same vessel?

595
01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:01.610
Yes.

596
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.770
Yes.

597
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.880
So I'm Kane.

598
01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:28.890
They...
I just had a meeting as Kane.

599
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:30.720
They said...
No. I'm definitely Kane.

600
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.510
I just had a meeting as Kane
and he knew me as Kane.

601
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.430
So I'm definitely Bourne.
I'm also just
definitely Kane.

602
01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.810
It's all just boats.

603
01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.230
I got blueprints and cameras
and security systems.

604
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:42.440
I just found
John Michael Kane's body.

605
01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:45.320
In a morgue here
in Paris.

606
01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:49.990
But if you are
John Michael Kane.
whose body do they have?

607
01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.540
What was the name again?

608
01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:00.630
Kane.

609
01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:01.830
Kane.

610
01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.250
John Michael Kane.

611
01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.000
John Michael Kane.

612
01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:12.800
Kane. It's number 121.

613
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:15.680
I want to see the body.

614
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:19.020
Our boss could come back.
We are not
supposed to do that.

615
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:21.060
Come on.

616
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:39.290
Is this it?
I mean. where is he?

617
01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.370
I don't know.

618
01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:51.720
Who are you?
What's going on here?

619
01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.140
Where's the body
that goes in here?

620
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.640
I said someone
came last night.

621
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.310
I know. Where'd
they take the body?

622
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:58.600
Look. this is not
a carnival. okay?

623
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.480
People call.
they make an appointment.
follow the rules.

624
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.730
Everyone signs in and out.
This is a serious place.
Serious work.

625
01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.400
It's not just to come in
whenever you like!

626
01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.940
You're right.
We didn't sign in.

627
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:10.280
Get the hell
out of here.

628
01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.740
Fine. fine.
No. I'm just gonna
go sign in.

629
01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:13.110
Okay. go.

630
01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:17.410
Is this it?

631
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:18.790
Slow down.
You can't just
take the book.

632
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:19.950
This is it?

633
01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.670
It's okay.
There's a pencil in here.
That's fine.

634
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:25.670
Honey. why don't you go
wait outside? Here it is.

635
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:27.250
We can't have...
Okay.

636
01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:32.720
Jason. what just happened
in there?
What are you looking for?

637
01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.430
Nykwana Wombosi.

638
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:37.640
Wombosi went
to the morgue
to visit Kane.

639
01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.560
See?

640
01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.640
So?

641
01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:43.270
So look.
he's in the Alliance
Security brochure.

642
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:44.600
Same guy.

643
01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:46.270
This guy knows.

644
01:13:18.970 --> 01:13:23.310
My French sucks. I can't...
It says something
about a boat or...

645
01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:29.270
I don't understand.
What does it say?
You read it. Tell me. What?

646
01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:35.450
It says that 3 weeks
before he was killed.
Mr. Wombosi told police

647
01:13:35.530 --> 01:13:39.280
that a man came
onto his yacht. five miles
off the coast of Marseilles

648
01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:41.240
and tried to kill him.

649
01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.670
It says that he chased the man
off the boat and shot him
twice in the back.

650
01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.420
It says I'm an assassin.

651
01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.050
What's going on?

652
01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:42.640
What the hell
are you doing?

653
01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.100
Go. Go.
What are...

654
01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:47.520
We're blown. Come on.

655
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.350
Blown?
What is "blown"?

656
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:57.650
Keep walking.
Keep walking.

657
01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:00.820
What do you think
they're doing back there?
They're on to the hotel.

658
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:02.240
No. You don't
know that.

659
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:03.740
Trust me.
Just keep walking.

660
01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.230
Are you crazy?
What are you doing now?

661
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:31.060
Jason!

662
01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:33.190
This is blown.

663
01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:42.700
Marie?
Get away.

664
01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:43.950
Marie. stop right there.

665
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:45.030
Get away from me.

666
01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.870
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?

667
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:48.250
Marie.
Is that what's next?

668
01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:50.460
Listen. stay calm.
Stay calm.

669
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:52.920
Whatever we do.
we have to do it together.

670
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.340
We have to be...
We?

671
01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:56.090
The only thing
we had in common

672
01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:57.880
was that neither of us
knew who you were.

673
01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:59.840
We've passed that now.
Listen to me!

674
01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:03.340
The police will find us.
The people who took
that picture in the embassy

675
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:06.350
who killed Wombosi.
they're gonna come here
and kill us.

676
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:07.930
The people who you work for.

677
01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:11.980
I will take you
wherever you need to go.

678
01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:14.110
I'll take you there.
I'll leave you there.

679
01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:16.440
You can do whatever you want.
You never have to
see me again.

680
01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:19.440
But not here.
If we stay here.
we die.

681
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:30.660
Boy. great police work!
Really brilliant!

682
01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:34.500
Why don't they just hang out
a banner that says.
"Don't come back!"

683
01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:39.510
Jesus Christ!
What is the French word
for "stakeout"?

684
01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:49.520
Okay. this was 16 minutes ago.

685
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:52.520
This is our starting point.

686
01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.100
They can't fly.
Trains are risky.
Nicky?

687
01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:56.150
<i>Here.</i>

688
01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:59.730
I need to know everything
Paris's finest
is doing on this.

689
01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:00.940
<i>l'm on it.</i>

690
01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.990
<i>You said 24 hours.
and he's not back.</i>

691
01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:09.370
No. But we got a good idea
where he is.

692
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:12.620
<i>You've got a black ops agent
who's off the reservation.</i>

693
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:14.370
<i>He's trashed
an American consulate.</i>

694
01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:15.830
<i>He's on the run
somewhere in Europe.</i>

695
01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.840
You don't know why.
I got to stand before
an oversight committee.

696
01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:20.960
What will I tell them
about Treadstone?

697
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:23.300
You're worried about
a budget meeting?

698
01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:26.510
We don't take care of this.
we don't make it
to the men's room.

699
01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:29.640
Now. is that clear enough
for you?

700
01:17:29.890 --> 01:17:31.770
We will burn for this.

701
01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.480
We will both of us burn.

702
01:17:36.150 --> 01:17:39.820
All right. I want two teams.
Daryl. Ray. stay on the grids.

703
01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.320
Brian. Harris. Steve.

704
01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:44.320
I want to work on this girl.

705
01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.240
Where about this
residency pattern?

706
01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.410
We started it.

707
01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:48.700
Get it out.

708
01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.960
<i>We cross-referenced
numbers from the grandmother.
stepbrother.</i>

709
01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.710
When we found convergence.
we took the numbers.

710
01:17:57.790 --> 01:17:58.710
back-checked them.

711
01:17:58.790 --> 01:18:02.340
ran a search merge
with other data we had.
which wasn't much.

712
01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:03.840
Pins. These pins.

713
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.180
These are all the places
we think she's lived
in the last six years.

714
01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:10.680
<i>One. two. three. four. five.</i>

715
01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:12.560
<i>That's our pool.</i>

716
01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:19.360
No answer.

717
01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:21.940
How many times
you let it ring?

718
01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.490
Look. if you don't
want to go. I'll hitch.

719
01:18:24.570 --> 01:18:26.110
I said I'd take you.

720
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:29.910
Those are the targets.

721
01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:34.950
Beg. borrow. hack.
tap. bypass!
I don't care what you do!

722
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:40.130
I want to know everything
you can tell me about what's
going on at those locations.

723
01:18:58.270 --> 01:19:00.310
How do you know
he still owns this?

724
01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:05.150
Eamon always had money.
He would never sell this.

725
01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.180
Marie?

726
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:37.390
What?

727
01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:40.640
We got to go.

728
01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.520
What?

729
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:44.230
We got to go.

730
01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:49.030
I thought it would...

731
01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:56.790
Oh. shit. that's Eamon.
I'll talk to him.

732
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:57.870
We're leaving.

733
01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.830
Eamon. Surprise.

734
01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:07.460
It's me. Marie.
Wow. God.

735
01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.470
there's a really
good reason for this.

736
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:12.130
There bloody well
better be.

737
01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:13.300
Daddy!

738
01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:14.850
Hang on. Hang on.

739
01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:19.560
I had no idea
you would be here.

740
01:20:20.230 --> 01:20:23.190
Well. why would I be here?
It's only my
bloody house. right?

741
01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.110
Yeah.

742
01:20:26.230 --> 01:20:27.900
Did she get you
into this?

743
01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:31.490
It was just gonna
be for a day.

744
01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:34.160
Daddy. Alain has to go pee!

745
01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.080
All right. all right.
come on. Here.
Get out of the car.

746
01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:41.000
Okay. in you go.

747
01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.620
Come on. Alain.

748
01:20:44.210 --> 01:20:45.330
I'm sorry. I...

749
01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.090
I thought it would be okay.
But I guess I was wrong.

750
01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:50.010
Let's find Mommy.
Mommy?

751
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:51.590
Mommy is away for two days.
thank God.

752
01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:59.310
You've got yourself
all tied up here.

753
01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:00.430
Okay.

754
01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:06.270
What's he do
for a living?

755
01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:09.530
He used to be
in shipping.

756
01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.990
Is he good for you?

757
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.660
Are you happy?

758
01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.330
You know me.
I try too hard.

759
01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:24.080
Here you go.

760
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:26.130
Sleep well.

761
01:21:26.290 --> 01:21:27.670
Good night.

762
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:31.510
I'll sleep on the floor.

763
01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.640
This was when?
11:45 a.m.

764
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:42.890
Which is definitely within
the driving range of Paris.

765
01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:46.690
The call came from
a highway rest stop.
southbound side.

766
01:21:46.770 --> 01:21:48.230
Yeah.
What's this yellow pin?

767
01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.610
She spent
a couple of months
there in 1997.

768
01:21:50.690 --> 01:21:52.480
Closest town is Riom.

769
01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:57.950
We took her family's
phone records and collated
the international calls.

770
01:21:58.030 --> 01:21:59.910
They were in Paris
at 2:00 a.m.

771
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:02.830
They can't fly.
The train's too dangerous.

772
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:05.620
He knows better
than to go anywhere
we might track him.

773
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.500
So this is our best guess.

774
01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:08.270
What are you
doing here?

775
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:10.310
The kids.
I was worried.
I couldn't sleep.

776
01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.610
You're gonna wake them up.
We got to go.

777
01:23:12.690 --> 01:23:14.780
I don't want to know
who I am anymore.

778
01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:17.400
I don't care.
I don't want to know.

779
01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.160
Come on.
We'll talk about...

780
01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:24.080
Everything I found out
I want to forget.

781
01:23:24.450 --> 01:23:25.490
It's okay.

782
01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:27.790
I don't care who I am
or what I did.

783
01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:30.620
It's okay.

784
01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:32.080
We have this money.

785
01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:34.420
We can hide.

786
01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:40.130
Can we do that?
Is there any chance
you can do that?

787
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:49.310
I don't know.

788
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:56.110
Come on.

789
01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:08.910
Here. boy!
Here. boy!

790
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:10.620
Morning.

791
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:12.960
Christ.
You were up early.

792
01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:15.290
Bless you
for making coffee.

793
01:24:23.970 --> 01:24:25.720
One night.
You weren't kidding.

794
01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:28.220
For a change.

795
01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:30.770
He's not there either.

796
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.690
And you looked
by the car?

797
01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:34.350
He's not anywhere.

798
01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.230
All right.
let me get dressed.

799
01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.400
Who?

800
01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:39.820
Bloody dog's
gone missing.

801
01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:41.530
Does that happen a lot?

802
01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:44.070
What? That mutt?
Miss his breakfast?
Not a chance.

803
01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.990
It's always
something. right?

804
01:24:48.330 --> 01:24:50.120
Get in the basement.

805
01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:51.410
What?

806
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Get everyone
in the basement now.

807
01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.420
What the hell
are you talking about?

808
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:58.960
You're in danger.
Your family's in danger.
I don't have time to explain.

809
01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:00.960
Wait a minute. What the...
Eamon.

810
01:25:01.050 --> 01:25:02.420
You should go.

811
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:03.630
What the hell
have you done?

812
01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.180
It's not her.
It's me.

813
01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:08.680
You need to get out of sight
and in the basement
as quick as you can.

814
01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:10.430
Daddy.

815
01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:16.940
I'm sorry.

816
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:18.360
Let's go.

817
01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:38.880
The phone is dead.
Yeah.

818
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:42.920
Jason. who's out there?
Who is it?

819
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.860
What are you doing?

820
01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:03.940
Oh. no.

821
01:26:07.950 --> 01:26:11.240
We should never
have come here.
I... These children...

822
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:12.740
That's not gonna happen.

823
01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:43.060
Where is it?
Where's the weapon?

824
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:50.150
Who else is out here?
Who else?
How many you got with you?

825
01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:51.820
I'm not gonna ask you again.

826
01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:54.570
I work alone. Like you.

827
01:28:57.330 --> 01:28:59.120
We always work alone.

828
01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:01.870
What do you mean?
Who are you? Rome?

829
01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.290
Paris?

830
01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:07.290
Treadstone. both of us.

831
01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:09.170
Treadstone?
Which one?

832
01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:10.840
Paris. I live in Paris.

833
01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.590
You get the headaches?

834
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:14.590
Yeah.

835
01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:16.680
I get such bad headaches.

836
01:29:16.930 --> 01:29:19.350
You know at night
when you're driving a car?

837
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:21.060
Maybe it's to do
with the headlights.

838
01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:22.890
What is Treadstone?

839
01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:26.020
Treadstone said pills.

840
01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:29.730
They said go to Paris.

841
01:29:30.150 --> 01:29:32.320
Is Treadstone in Paris?

842
01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:35.740
Look at this.

843
01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:40.120
Look at what
they make you give.

844
01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:06.810
All right. all right.

845
01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.900
All right. Claudia.
get in the front
and put your belt on.

846
01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:12.190
All right.
we're just gonna put you
in the back.

847
01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:14.360
All right. get in
the front. Claudia.

848
01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:21.660
I'm not waiting. Marie.

849
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:23.750
One minute. Eamon.
I'm not waiting!

850
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:25.500
Please!

851
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:27.920
Take it.

852
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.420
I took out $30.000.
The rest is yours.

853
01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:33.340
That's it?
That's all I got.

854
01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:37.760
No. that's not what I meant.

855
01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:42.350
This is not gonna stop. Marie.
You got to get out now.
Away from me.

856
01:30:43.810 --> 01:30:46.310
You got to get out.
You got to start running.

857
01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.350
You get low.
you stay low.

858
01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:50.310
No more friends.
Nothing familiar.

859
01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:56.780
There's enough in there
for you to make a life.
Any life.

860
01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:58.240
I'm out of here. Marie!

861
01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:59.360
Hey!

862
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:04.290
Get in the car.
You got to go.

863
01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.750
What are you gonna do?

864
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:13.840
I'll end it.

865
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:15.550
Go ahead.

866
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:18.680
Please.

867
01:32:37.130 --> 01:32:38.710
Code in. please.

868
01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:41.050
Code in.

869
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:46.680
<i>Code in.</i>

870
01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:52.310
<i>Who is this?</i>

871
01:32:58.030 --> 01:32:59.820
Who the hell are you?

872
01:33:03.570 --> 01:33:05.320
<i>The man you sent is dead.</i>

873
01:33:05.410 --> 01:33:07.780
<i>So whoever this is.
you better start talking.</i>

874
01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:10.790
<i>Hello. Jason.</i>

875
01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:13.920
<i>So. what are we into now?</i>

876
01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:23.050
It only goes two ways.
Either you come in
and let us make this right.

877
01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:25.340
or we'll have to keep going
until we're satisfied.

878
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:27.180
You mean
until you kill me.

879
01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:31.730
I can't fix this
if I don't know
what the problem is.

880
01:33:31.810 --> 01:33:34.350
Tell me what we're into.
and I'll do the best I can.

881
01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.860
Why don't you talk to
Marie. Jason?

882
01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:48.580
Let's ask Marie
what she wants to do.

883
01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:50.620
<i>Actually. l don't think
she gives a shit.</i>

884
01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:52.450
She's dead.

885
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.800
I'm sorry to hear that.
How did that happen?

886
01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.470
<i>She was slowing me down.</i>

887
01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.470
Jason. all we've been
doing right from...

888
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:09.640
<i>Enough.</i>

889
01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:10.720
Enough.

890
01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:14.390
5:30 p.m. Paris.

891
01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.190
Today. Pont Neuf.

892
01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:18.980
Come alone.
you walk to the middle
of that bridge.

893
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:21.070
<i>You take off your jacket.
Face east.</i>

894
01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:23.070
<i>l'll redial this number.
Jason. wait!</i>

895
01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:38.080
First flight out. Tell Nicky
I'll call from the car.
Tell her to find Picot. Go.

896
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:41.920
So...

897
01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:44.340
What are we gonna do?

898
01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:46.680
I told you I'd clean this up.
That's what I'm doing.

899
01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.430
Can you really bring him in?

900
01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.430
I think we're past that.
don't you?

901
01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:53.600
Do you have a better idea?

902
01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.390
You've given me nothing
but a trail of
collateral damage

903
01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.850
from Zurich to Paris.
I couldn't do much worse.

904
01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:01.690
Why don't you go upstairs
and book a conference room?

905
01:35:01.770 --> 01:35:04.110
Maybe you can talk him
to death.

906
01:36:21.310 --> 01:36:24.190
<i>The bus.
the tour bus.
second level.</i>

907
01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.440
<i>Negative on the target.</i>

908
01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:32.610
<i>Position one?
Negative.</i>

909
01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:34.870
<i>Position two?
Negative.</i>

910
01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:52.760
<i>Position three.
motorcycle.</i>

911
01:36:53.470 --> 01:36:54.640
<i>Negative.</i>

912
01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:55.890
<i>Negative.</i>

913
01:37:20.250 --> 01:37:21.290
Jason?

914
01:37:21.370 --> 01:37:25.120
I told you to come alone.
I guess that
was too complicated.

915
01:37:25.210 --> 01:37:27.000
So try this. I'm gone.

916
01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:32.260
Fuck.

917
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:41.100
<i>Get Nicky on the phone.</i>

918
01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.200
<i>Yeah?</i>

919
01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.660
<i>How long does it take
to wipe the room
down and move it?</i>

920
01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.660
<i>Get rid of everything?
Yeah.</i>

921
01:38:03.370 --> 01:38:04.500
<i>Two to three hours.</i>

922
01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:06.120
<i>All right.
well. get started.</i>

923
01:38:13.170 --> 01:38:14.470
Listen. no breaks.

924
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:17.390
Two men outside.
one in the lobby.
And keep your eyes open.

925
01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:22.060
<i>Keep the truck?
Yeah. keep the truck.</i>

926
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:25.520
I'm gonna close
this unit down. We'll move
the gear in the truck.

927
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.750
They were covering Spain.
Malta. Morocco.

928
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:48.330
Yes. all local police
radio traffic.

929
01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:52.000
No. for northern Europe
we need
an authorized directive. Yeah.

930
01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:56.260
Okay. they're on it.
We'll have a satellite
download in 30 minutes.

931
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:07.750
Where's your field box?

932
01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:13.670
Where's your field box?

933
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:15.380
It's right there.

934
01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:18.130
The whole system's
gone haywire.

935
01:40:19.090 --> 01:40:21.300
That's this window
right here.

936
01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:23.550
Dining room window?

937
01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:26.600
I don't get it.

938
01:40:28.810 --> 01:40:30.940
Dead.
The phones are dead.

939
01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.900
It's Bourne.
isn't it?

940
01:40:35.110 --> 01:40:36.440
Just quiet.

941
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:25.780
You move. you die.

942
01:41:26.490 --> 01:41:27.580
Bourne.

943
01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:28.910
Gun down.

944
01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:36.170
In there.

945
01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:39.800
Okay. so what
do you want...

946
01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.260
Treadstone.

947
01:41:41.670 --> 01:41:44.260
You better take
a look around.
There's not much left.

948
01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:45.430
Are you Treadstone?

949
01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:46.890
Am I Treadstone? Me?

950
01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:48.970
What the hell are
you talking about?

951
01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:50.520
He's lost it.

952
01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:52.600
You better start
filling in the blanks here!

953
01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:54.980
'Cause I thought
we were on the same side.

954
01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:56.270
Whose side is that?

955
01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.190
You don't know what
you're doing. do you?
You don't have a goddamn clue!

956
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:01.820
Who am I?

957
01:42:02.190 --> 01:42:04.150
You're U.S.
government property!

958
01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.410
You're a malfunctioning
$30 million weapon!

959
01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:09.530
You're a total
goddamn catastrophe!

960
01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:12.620
And. by God. if it kills me.
you will tell me
how this happened.

961
01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:13.830
Why are you trying
to kill me?

962
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:15.670
What happened
in Marseilles?

963
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:18.630
You sent me
to kill Wombosi.

964
01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:21.960
Kill Wombosi?
Yeah. we can do that
any time we want.

965
01:42:22.050 --> 01:42:24.420
I can send Nicky to do that.
for Christ's sake.

966
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:27.300
Mr. Wombosi
was supposed to be dead
three weeks ago.

967
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:31.510
He was supposed to have died
in a way where the
only possible explanation was

968
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:34.680
that he'd been murdered
by a member of
his own entourage.

969
01:42:34.770 --> 01:42:36.560
I don't send you to kill.

970
01:42:36.650 --> 01:42:38.270
I send you to be invisible.

971
01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.610
I send you because
you don't exist.

972
01:42:40.690 --> 01:42:42.940
I want to know
what happened
in Marseilles.

973
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:45.860
I don't remember
what happened in Marseilles.

974
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:48.660
Bullshit! This is
unacceptable. soldier.

975
01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:50.410
You hear me? You failed!

976
01:42:50.490 --> 01:42:52.120
Unacceptable?
You failed!

977
01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:53.490
You failed and
you're gonna tell me why!

978
01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:56.040
I can't tell you!
I don't remember!

979
01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:59.170
You brought Kane to life.
You put together
a meeting with Wombosi.

980
01:42:59.250 --> 01:43:01.670
You found the
security company.
You broke into the office!

981
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:05.920
For Christ's sake.
you picked the yacht
as the goddamn strike point!

982
01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.020
<i>You picked the boat.</i>

983
01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:17.940
<i>You picked the day.
You tracked the crew.</i>

984
01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:19.520
<i>The food. the fuel!</i>

985
01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:22.400
<i>You told us where.
You told us when.</i>

986
01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:25.480
<i>You hid out on that boat
five days.</i>

987
01:43:25.610 --> 01:43:27.820
<i>You were in. Jason.
You were in!</i>

988
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:29.360
<i>lt was over!</i>

989
01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:32.180
No. you do remember.

990
01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:36.560
Don't you?

991
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:44.810
I don't want to
do this anymore.

992
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:48.570
I don't think
that's a decision
you can make.

993
01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:56.410
Jason Bourne is dead.
Do you hear me?

994
01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:58.410
He drowned two weeks ago.

995
01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:01.500
You're gonna go tell them
that Bourne is dead.
Understand?

996
01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:03.080
Where are you gonna go?

997
01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:06.130
I swear.
if I even feel somebody
behind me.

998
01:45:06.210 --> 01:45:08.000
there is no measure
to how fast

999
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:11.130
and how hard
I will bring this fight
to your doorstep.

1000
01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:13.090
I'm on my own side now.

1001
01:48:47.770 --> 01:48:48.810
It's done.

1002
01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:51.020
Shut it down.

1003
01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:32.390
<i>The Treadstone project
has actually
already been terminated.</i>

1004
01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:35.650
<i>lt was designed primarily
as a sort of
advanced game program.</i>

1005
01:49:35.730 --> 01:49:38.440
<i>We'd hoped it might build
into a good training platform.</i>

1006
01:49:38.530 --> 01:49:42.070
<i>But quite honestly.
for a strictly
theoretical exercise.</i>

1007
01:49:42.150 --> 01:49:44.450
<i>the cost-benefit ratio
was just too high.</i>

1008
01:49:44.530 --> 01:49:46.620
<i>lt's all but decommissioned
at this point.</i>

1009
01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:48.280
All right.
what's next?

1010
01:49:48.370 --> 01:49:50.660
<i>Okay. this is</i>

1011
01:49:52.290 --> 01:49:53.500
<i>Blackbriar.</i>

1012
01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:56.750
<i>Blackbriar is a joint DOD
communications program</i>

1013
01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.790
<i>that we really feel
has good traction to it.</i>

1014
01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:00.880
<i>lt's got legs.
lt'll run and run.</i>

1015
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:05.340
<i>lt combines elements
of proactive and
reactive fields of security...</i>

1016
01:50:48.930 --> 01:50:50.550
This your store?

1017
01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:51.760
Yeah.

1018
01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:57.270
It's nice. It's a little hard
to find. but...

1019
01:51:01.730 --> 01:51:03.530
Think I could
rent a scooter?

1020
01:51:07.570 --> 01:51:09.070
You have ID?

1021
01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:11.990
Not really.

1022
