4
00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:41.841
I once heard an old proverb
about hunting. It goes like this:

5
00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.645
"Lions are born knowing they're predators.

6
00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:49.940
Antelopes understand that they are prey.

7
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:55.229
Humans are the only creatures
on earth given a choice.”

8
00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:56.860
I don't know who said that.

9
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.944
but I'm pretty sure they never imagined
a place like pensacola.

10
00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:04.913
Jj

11
00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:13.735
This morning.
a $5.000 reward is being offered

12
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.499
by the family of Lucy baylor.

13
00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:19.132
a 16-year-old pensacola girl who
disappeared last week.

14
00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:21.508
Investigators for the county
sheriff's department

15
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.807
said in a press conference
Tuesday morning

16
00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:27.011
that there are people they'd like
to talk to about the disappearance.

17
00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.562
but said
they are not necessarily suspects.

18
00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:09.014
Jj

19
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.660
Holy Christ!

20
00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:08.905
Victim is a Caucasian
female approximately 20 years old...

21
00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.581
Trauma due to...

22
00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:58.232
I didn't know
they'd called y'all already.

23
00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:02.340
No. I was just a bit east of here.
Thought I'd have a look.

24
00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.042
Be my guest.

25
00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:10.174
Jj

26
00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:22.231
Yeah. it looks like he dragged her
from the road.

27
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.070
No. She was killed at a primary location
and dumped here last night.

28
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.074
How the hell can you
reckon that from here?

29
00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.074
You got an ID?

30
00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:37.493
Sarah kellogg.

31
00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:42.498
Twenty-six. couple of possessions.
couple of solicitations.

32
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:46.585
Last known was Tallahassee.
Can't find the missing report.

33
00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:52.340
- How's your wife?
- Pain in the ass as usual.

34
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.263
Get high resolution pictures
of those bite marks

35
00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.769
- before the heat hits triple digits.
- Yeah.

36
00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.564
- You still owe me a beer.
- Yeah. I know.

37
00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:25.632
Hey. no more coke
till I see some titties in this room.

38
00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.835
Shut the fuck up. walton!

39
00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:31.137
Shut the fucking door. bitch!

40
00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.839
Tracey. get out of here.

41
00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:53.804
Evening. ma'am. Care to join me
for some pancakes?

42
00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.967
You need a friend. little girl?

43
00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:19.238
Come on. let's get you out of the rain.

44
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.368
Hey. where you going?

45
00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.997
Hey! Ah!

46
00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.203
Don't make me chase. huh?

47
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.296
You all right?

48
00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:34.555
Hey. you all right?

49
00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:42.974
Come on. Come on. let's get you
somewhere safe.

50
00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:44.895
Come on.

51
00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:55.653
Don't fuck
with me tonight. Karl. Fuck you.

52
00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:59.536
- I just do my job. That's it.
- Why don't we switch places?

53
00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.658
How about you come in here
and shake your ass

54
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.583
and I'll sit in the car
and eat fucking burritos all night?

55
00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.205
I think your guy's here.

56
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:09.792
Copy that. Karl.

57
00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.507
Knock. knock.

58
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.847
Oh. you've got to be
the stupidest bitch in pensacola.

59
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.808
You remember me”?

60
00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:32.982
I see a lot of people. baby.

61
00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:35.485
Not like me. you don't.

62
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.282
You're sexy as fuck!

63
00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.530
Don't worry. I sent
your goofy-ass little date packing.

64
00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.954
so I don't think we'll be disturbed.

65
00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:48.751
I caught you back in Loxley. didn't I?

66
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.212
Which makes this second offense
punishable. doesn't it?

67
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.425
Shit.

68
00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.098
This is not our target.

69
00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.351
Well. this is my beautiful universe.

70
00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:13.772
And every fucking thing in it...

71
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.402
Belongs to me.

72
00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:21.075
Just like earth to god.

73
00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:21.992
What?

74
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.072
So that means all of you working bitches

75
00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:27.373
belong to me too.

76
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.325
You understand what I'm saying?

77
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.206
Fuck this. I'm coming in.

78
00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.297
No.

79
00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.305
Okay.

80
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:44.056
So you're one of those bitches. huh?

81
00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.009
Can't hear unless bleeding. Well.

82
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.846
I'm coming in.
This is not our target.

83
00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.398
- Just give me two minutes.
- For what?

84
00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.396
You gonna do your makeup? Hm?

85
00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:58.563
'Cause what's gonna happen...

86
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:02.487
Doesn't have shit to do
with looking pretty.

87
00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.580
Now. lift up that skirt...

88
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.704
And bend.

89
00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.121
No.

90
00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:19.963
Okay.

91
00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.849
Look what I got.

92
00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:31.521
Now. I could put you in a dumpster
and feed you to the little piggies.

93
00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:32.893
And you know what else?

94
00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.109
Nobody would give a fuck!

95
00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:42.115
Okay.

96
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.284
What about you?

97
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.362
Too much of daddy kicking mommy
around the trailer park?

98
00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:57.004
Ah!

99
00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.718
- No!
- Ah!

100
00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:14.138
- What did you do?
- It's not him.

101
00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:15.895
Goddamn it!

102
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.693
- Oh. Karl.
- You promised me!

103
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.486
What the fuck did you want me to do. Karl?

104
00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.109
He was beating the shit out of me!

105
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.317
- This is gonna be bad.
- Karl...

106
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:28.323
- Let's get the fuck outta here.
- Okay. let's go.

107
00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.826
Oh. fuck.

108
00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:35.251
As we walk through
the valley of the shadow of death.

109
00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:38.830
we see temptation all around us.

110
00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:42.133
Who among us is not tempted
by the earthly delights

111
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.883
of fornication. intoxication.
and the like?

112
00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.260
Who among us is immune

113
00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:53.311
to the urge to partake
in such gratification?

114
00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:57.266
- Who among us...
- That's my daughter. Bethany.

115
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:02.771
Heading home to see her now.

116
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.944
You wanna stay with us tonight?

117
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.081
My daughter would love you.

118
00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:21.466
Yes.

119
00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:24.546
Please.

120
00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:28.546
Well. it's settled then.

121
00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:04.528
I understand this
is emotional for you. Byron.

122
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:06.258
It's not about emotion.

123
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.679
Well. shit. we all got
our nuts kicked in over this shit.

124
00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:12.257
And truth is. you still young.

125
00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:15.640
And you too good a lawman to get wrapped
around the axle over just one case.

126
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.439
Oh. excuse me. Seven unsolved murders
is more than one case. sir.

127
00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:21.265
You know we can't confirm
those connections.

128
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:24.068
Listen. the Sarah kellogg scene.
it matches. sir.

129
00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:26.862
The bite marks. the positioning.
the profile. everything.

130
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:28.905
Let me bottom line this. Byron.

131
00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.700
- You can't reopen this.
- Excuse me?

132
00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.744
- You've been moved to something else.
- When?

133
00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:37.449
- Right now.
- Okay. Let's... let's engage the FBI.

134
00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:41.035
- A multi-jurisdictional capital offender.
- You're joking. right?

135
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.497
You gotta move on. We don't have a choice.

136
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.125
All right.

137
00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:51.425
You know. nobody's ever stood up
for those girls.

138
00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:57.844
And I just can't seem
to reconcile that no more.

139
00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:03.774
Jj

140
00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.706
Headquarters is frustrated.

141
00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:20.499
He is fucking lucky to be alive.

142
00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.668
They pulled the plug on us.

143
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:28.045
Operation safe highway
is moving out of Florida.

144
00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:29.546
- When?
- Now.

145
00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:33.004
On to interstate 5
in the beautiful northwest.

146
00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.511
No. you go to headquarters
and you tell them to fuck off.

147
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.683
It's not your operation.

148
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.206
The minute I got made bait and trap.

149
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.471
it became my operation
and you fucking know that!

150
00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:44.228
There's nothing I can do.

151
00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:46.479
Okay. look. Karl.
last night's fuck-up was on me.

152
00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.732
Okay? I fucked up. I'm sorry.

153
00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:51.360
I have communication
with over a dozen active offenders

154
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.316
who are chasing down these girls.

155
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.618
My biggest target is lined up for tonight.

156
00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.225
I'm tired of having this conversation.

157
00:15:58.374 --> 00:15:59.864
I'm doing that fucking sting tonight.

158
00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:03.125
- Bullshit!
- Watch me.

159
00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:06.984
The sheriff's department

160
00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.794
is working closely
with state law enforcement

161
00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:11.501
to determine if there's a connection
between this case

162
00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:14.053
and a string of similar abduction cases

163
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.678
that have occurred along the I-10 corridor
in recent months.

164
00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:20.510
A spokesperson for the county
said that they cannot comment.

165
00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:23.017
as this is an ongoing investigation.

166
00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:25.894
They are asking anyone
with information to come forward.

167
00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:35.525
Jj

168
00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:53.468
- Help you?
- Good afternoon. ma'am.

169
00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:55.090
My name is Byron Crawford.

170
00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.910
You hear to purchase the property.
Mr. Crawford? Well. it ain't for sale.

171
00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.014
No. ma'am.

172
00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:02.093
I'm with the Florida state police. and...

173
00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:05.893
May I ask if you're related
to Sarah kellogg?

174
00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:16.320
Some prick cop called asking
some downright rude questions.

175
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.776
Said they found her outside pensacola.

176
00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:22.830
I apologize. ma'am.
It shouldn't have happened that way.

177
00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.080
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

178
00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:32.749
You drove all the way down here
just to tell me my daughter been killed?

179
00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:34.761
Yes. ma'am.

180
00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:39.881
That's how it should be.
I'm sorry you heard otherwise.

181
00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.011
You might as well come
and sit for a while.

182
00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:02.224
This the part where you tell me
you ain't gonna rest

183
00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.534
till you catch the son of a bitch
that killed Sarah?

184
00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.206
Uh. no. ma'am.

185
00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:10.583
Anybody that telling you that
is. uh. telling you a lie.

186
00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:12.914
Odds are against us in a big way.

187
00:18:15.678 --> 00:18:18.545
Well. don't beat around the bush
or nothing. Mr. Crawford.

188
00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:20.129
Shit!

189
00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:22.431
I guess I appreciate the honesty.

190
00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.557
Maybe I will take you up
on that drink after all.

191
00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:30.856
Good move.

192
00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:33.434
Some days it's best to be drinking.

193
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:34.860
Yeah.

194
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.026
You from the panhandle.
Mr. Crawford?

195
00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:41.575
- No. not far. up in Marianna.
- Ooh.

196
00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:53.747
Y'all always been. uh. round Tallahassee?

197
00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:56.753
Tallahassee? Shit.

198
00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:59.756
Family's been in this house
damn near 100 years.

199
00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.513
That's me and my twin sister. Caroline.

200
00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:07.180
I still remember getting
that picture taken.

201
00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:10.388
My mother could not stop fussing
with those damn dresses.

202
00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:14.226
Ma died that summer.
coltier factory fire in thomasville.

203
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.062
Oh. that's terrible. I'm sorry.

204
00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:20.114
My father was wounded in Korea.

205
00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:26.238
After my mother died.
it was like a switch flipped in his mind.

206
00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:29.949
He would drink.

207
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.376
Started in the morning
and be talking to himself

208
00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:36.797
by the time we got home
from school.

209
00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:39.045
Scared the hell out of me.

210
00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:41.752
We'd run and hide in the switchgrass.

211
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.431
We'd play for hours.

212
00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.142
It'd get dark.

213
00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:50.602
We never noticed.

214
00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:57.017
Until he'd come out for us...

215
00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.899
Angry like a crazed dog.

216
00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.368
I can still hear his voice.

217
00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:08.195
Sometimes. he caught us.

218
00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:13.200
Sometimes. he didn't.

219
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.915
We'd just wait.

220
00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.632
Just had to wait.

221
00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:29.975
"Till the clock strikes midnight.”
Caroline would say.

222
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.101
Just like cinderella.

223
00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:39.268
Can I get you a beer instead?

224
00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:41.354
No. ma'am. I'm...

225
00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:43.651
I'm fine.

226
00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:49.494
Sarah reminded me so much of Caroline.

227
00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:54.166
Both always looking to escape.

228
00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.118
And shitty taste in men.

229
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:58.621
Sarah had a steady boyfriend?

230
00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:03.505
Hell. I wouldn't even know.

231
00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:05.678
She'd been gone damn near a year.

232
00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:08.683
Well...

233
00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:13.435
I'm gonna get out of here.

234
00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.643
But. um...

235
00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:20.234
If you need anything...

236
00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:24.317
Just give me a call.

237
00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:35.283
- How'd she die?
- Excuse me?

238
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.787
You know. how was Sarah killed?

239
00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:51.424
Well. then can I ask you a favor. Mr.
Crawford?

240
00:21:55.314 --> 00:22:00.104
By the grace of god.
someone happens to catch this...

241
00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:04.353
Devil that killed my baby girl.

242
00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:07.155
will you come back and knock on this door?

243
00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:11.698
Good evening. ma'am.

244
00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:16.241
Jj

245
00:22:54.665 --> 00:22:56.701
Ooh!

246
00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:58.908
Oh! Who's that?

247
00:22:59.003 --> 00:23:01.244
Hi. babe.

248
00:23:01.338 --> 00:23:03.329
Aw...

249
00:23:05.551 --> 00:23:07.633
- Lord. I'm so blessed.
- Mwah.

250
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.587
Is that daddy?

251
00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:14.390
- How was your day?
- Oh. you don't wanna know.

252
00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:18.598
I got two phone calls this morning.

253
00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:22.189
The first was a missing person's report.

254
00:23:22.276 --> 00:23:28.067
Sixteen-year-old girl vanished from
a truck stop outside pensacola last night.

255
00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:35.699
And before that. a concrete salesman found
a dead body off I-10 by the state line.

256
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:38.496
- Was it her?
- Nope.

257
00:23:38.584 --> 00:23:40.745
Just some prostitute
from east Tallahassee.

258
00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:43.543
This job...

259
00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:50.968
I used to feel god's presence. but now...

260
00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:53.421
I don't know.

261
00:23:53.515 --> 00:23:57.554
You've got his love in your heart.
You know that.

262
00:23:58.562 --> 00:24:02.726
And that's why these girls
need someone like you.

263
00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:06.316
- I have faith in you.
- Mm...

264
00:24:11.659 --> 00:24:13.945
Is it burning. mommy?

265
00:24:14.036 --> 00:24:17.119
No. honey. it's just steam
from the hot water.

266
00:24:21.085 --> 00:24:23.167
Mm.

267
00:24:23.253 --> 00:24:25.118
- Good timing.
- Smells good.

268
00:24:27.675 --> 00:24:29.711
Elbows off the table.

269
00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:32.217
Now. what you reading now?

270
00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:34.511
It's called watership down.

271
00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:38.466
You gotta be the smartest
eight-year-old in the whole panhandle.

272
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.425
She's awfully young for that book.

273
00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:49.522
What we got?

274
00:24:49.613 --> 00:24:53.481
- Meatloaf! My favorite.
- Loaf. corn.

275
00:24:53.575 --> 00:24:56.567
Jj

276
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.797
- This is gonna be bad.
- Feel free to leave any time.

277
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:21.054
- Nobody's forcing you to stay.
- We could lose our badges.

278
00:25:21.145 --> 00:25:25.184
We're not gonna lose our badges. Karl.
I've been working this guy since Loxley.

279
00:25:25.274 --> 00:25:29.108
- Call the locals.
- Nobody gives a fuck about these girls.

280
00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:34.905
I don't want you to get hurt.

281
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:37.194
- Okay.
- I mean it.

282
00:25:37.286 --> 00:25:39.527
Okay. fine. this will be the last one.
Okay?

283
00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:41.861
And then we'll pack up and we'll go
to rainy-ass Seattle.

284
00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:45.866
- I'm not going.
- What?

285
00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:49.579
- Kirsten's gonna divorce me.
- Bullshit.

286
00:25:49.673 --> 00:25:52.665
She got a fucking attorney.

287
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.048
Karl. I didn't know. I'm sorry.

288
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.762
Fuck it. He's a no-show.
Let's get out of here.

289
00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:13.202
Johnson's still out sick. I'm gonna have
to ride his load up to mobile.

290
00:26:14.073 --> 00:26:17.156
Tonight? Pete. we were gonna do
that bookshelf.

291
00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:21.155
I know. baby. but there's just so many
jobs right now. and not enough drivers.

292
00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.578
You know. we're out here
in the middle of nowhere

293
00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:25.747
with two neighbors we barely know.

294
00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:30.077
Well. this is why we got full bellies
right now. ain't it?

295
00:26:30.172 --> 00:26:32.834
Just seems to be happening
an awful lot lately.

296
00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:35.667
You wanted me off the road.

297
00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:37.592
A manager has to be available. honey.

298
00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:42.590
Just get a bit lonely out here sometimes.

299
00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:44.299
Mm-hmm.

300
00:26:44.394 --> 00:26:46.806
And I can't help but miss you. Pete.

301
00:26:46.897 --> 00:26:47.897
Aw...

302
00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:55.064
I'll wake you up when I get home.
All right?

303
00:26:55.155 --> 00:26:57.862
- Promise?
- Mm-hmm.

304
00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.236
I'll quit if you want.

305
00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:01.612
- I will.
- No. you wouldn't.

306
00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:03.159
Hell. yeah. I'll quit right now.

307
00:27:03.247 --> 00:27:06.364
- You want me to quit?
- No. don't do that.

308
00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.870
All right.

309
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:12.078
- I love you. baby.
- I love you too.

310
00:27:12.172 --> 00:27:14.458
- Drive safe.
- Love you. baby.

311
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.211
- Good night. daddy.
- Good night. baby.

312
00:27:18.762 --> 00:27:20.844
All right. Bye.

313
00:27:25.978 --> 00:27:28.970
Jj

314
00:28:07.102 --> 00:28:08.102
Lose your key?

315
00:28:10.898 --> 00:28:13.435
Oh. don't be shy. handsome.

316
00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:15.265
Why don't you come have a drink?

317
00:28:20.115 --> 00:28:22.197
I could use the company.

318
00:28:22.284 --> 00:28:23.820
All right.

319
00:28:25.078 --> 00:28:26.284
Why not?

320
00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:46.888
You ain't no cop. right?

321
00:28:57.819 --> 00:28:58.934
How old are you?

322
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.895
Twenty.

323
00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:11.579
I sure do love this song.

324
00:29:24.888 --> 00:29:27.630
Be much obliged if you danced
with me. sugar.

325
00:29:58.922 --> 00:30:01.413
Yeah. that's about it.

326
00:30:01.508 --> 00:30:02.964
You a good girl?

327
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:05.630
What's that. hon?

328
00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:10.722
You a good girl?

329
00:30:11.852 --> 00:30:13.763
Mm-hmm.

330
00:30:41.798 --> 00:30:44.380
You're a dirty little girl. aren't you?

331
00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:56.472
You're a dirty. disgusting prostitute!

332
00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:36.592
It's okay.

333
00:31:36.686 --> 00:31:38.722
Whoo!

334
00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:40.933
Oh. man.

335
00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:13.254
Jj

336
00:32:15.392 --> 00:32:17.804
There you are. Mr. ball.

337
00:32:22.816 --> 00:32:24.852
I wonder if there's anything in here.

338
00:32:35.328 --> 00:32:38.741
Bethany!
Come on in. dear! Time for dinner!

339
00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:41.281
Coming. mommy.

340
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.997
Help! Is anybody there?

341
00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:57.089
Jj

342
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.562
It's a restricted area.
Boss ordered a lockdown.

343
00:33:53.657 --> 00:33:55.818
- Who's in charge over here?
- Detective yarborough.

344
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:56.909
Thank you.

345
00:33:56.993 --> 00:33:58.513
Hey. you gotta sign
the security log. Come on!

346
00:33:58.537 --> 00:34:02.075
- Don't take it personally. kid.
- Shit.

347
00:34:02.165 --> 00:34:03.496
Whoa. whoa!

348
00:34:03.583 --> 00:34:06.950
Did I miss a jurisdiction
reassignment. my friend?

349
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:08.626
Nope. Just having a look.

350
00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:12.171
Uh-huh. Why do I get the feeling that you
ain't being honest with me. Crawford?

351
00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:13.965
And that's no bueno at my crime scene.

352
00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:16.134
I'm being honest with you.
I'm just out here...

353
00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:17.961
Excuse me. Are you in charge here?

354
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:20.047
- Get these bozos outta here!
- Hey. buddy.

355
00:34:20.141 --> 00:34:21.256
We're the FBI.

356
00:34:22.269 --> 00:34:26.979
Well. nice to meet y'all. but what the
hell do you want at my crime scene?

357
00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:31.229
We target assholes who hunt underage.
potentially trafficked girls.

358
00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:34.561
Well. listen.
I appreciate the efforts you making

359
00:34:34.656 --> 00:34:36.567
in our little part of the world.

360
00:34:36.658 --> 00:34:39.400
- But why are we talking here?
- We had set up

361
00:34:39.494 --> 00:34:41.514
a low visibility prostitution sting
here last night.

362
00:34:41.538 --> 00:34:43.654
The sheriff's office never mentioned
anything to me.

363
00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:45.784
It's not a perfect science.

364
00:34:45.875 --> 00:34:47.061
Well. obviously not. all right?

365
00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:50.748
Because I got a 20-year-old girl
with her skull cracked in six places.

366
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.962
This target last night. he have a name?

367
00:34:56.052 --> 00:34:58.885
Okay. no. no. This has gone
far enough. all right?

368
00:34:58.972 --> 00:35:03.386
Protocol dictates that my lieutenant
talks to y'all superior. Okay?

369
00:35:03.476 --> 00:35:06.013
So quit while you're ahead. sweetheart.

370
00:35:22.704 --> 00:35:25.696
- I killed that girl.
- I hope you're kidding.

371
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:29.624
No. I mean. that should've been me.
I'm supposed to be protecting these girls.

372
00:35:29.711 --> 00:35:32.953
Bullshit! You could have died last night.

373
00:35:33.048 --> 00:35:36.666
Hi. My name is Byron Crawford.

374
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.716
and I'm an agent with the fdle.

375
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:43.805
You said this target had no-show
at a scheduled meeting before?

376
00:35:43.892 --> 00:35:47.851
- Uh. where was that?
- A few nights ago.

377
00:35:47.937 --> 00:35:51.475
The oasis motel. Pensacola.

378
00:35:52.776 --> 00:35:54.858
I was afraid of that.

379
00:35:54.944 --> 00:35:58.402
A young woman reported
that her 16-year-old sister went missing.

380
00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:01.232
Thursday night outside the oasis.

381
00:36:01.326 --> 00:36:03.817
I'd love to hear anything else
you got on this guy.

382
00:36:03.912 --> 00:36:07.450
If you remember anything else
from that night or. uh...

383
00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.498
Get any additional info
on the suspect. you know.

384
00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:12.166
give me a shout.

385
00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:17.331
Jj

386
00:36:48.164 --> 00:36:50.155
Jj

387
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:10.402
Jj

388
00:38:49.494 --> 00:38:52.327
- Hi. daddy.
- Hi. baby.

389
00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:55.405
Working on the bookshelf?
Mama will be so happy.

390
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.740
Let me help you.

391
00:38:58.962 --> 00:39:02.125
- I love you. baby.
- I love you too. daddy.

392
00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:04.206
I love you so much.

393
00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:09.510
- Come on. let's go play.
- Mm-hmm.

394
00:39:09.597 --> 00:39:10.882
All right.

395
00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:14.765
Jj

396
00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:25.564
I think I saw that girl at the oasis.

397
00:39:25.655 --> 00:39:29.398
She was walking to the service center.
like a zombie.

398
00:39:29.492 --> 00:39:31.679
How about you come
in here and shake your ass

399
00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:33.973
and I'll sit in the car
and eat fucking burritos all night?

400
00:39:33.997 --> 00:39:36.363
I didn't think too much of it.

401
00:39:36.457 --> 00:39:39.039
And then that assault came in.

402
00:39:39.127 --> 00:39:40.788
Christ.

403
00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:44.631
Well...

404
00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:48.709
We'll get him tomorrow.

405
00:39:50.763 --> 00:39:53.755
Jj

406
00:40:19.125 --> 00:40:20.285
Get up.

407
00:40:25.173 --> 00:40:27.755
Wash your arms and legs off
with the sponge.

408
00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:37.723
Do it.

409
00:40:38.895 --> 00:40:41.102
Now!

410
00:40:43.566 --> 00:40:46.228
I can't see. I can't...

411
00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:48.435
I can't see!

412
00:40:52.158 --> 00:40:55.195
It's right here. sweetheart.
Here we go.

413
00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:57.242
Here we go. Come here.

414
00:41:11.928 --> 00:41:13.213
Is that better?

415
00:41:16.057 --> 00:41:17.467
Use the sponge. Here.

416
00:41:23.106 --> 00:41:25.097
Jj

417
00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:34.647
- Hello.
- Hey.

418
00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:39.076
- What can I get you. man?
- I'll have what she's having. Thanks.

419
00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:43.702
First time the FBI voluntarily showed up
around this stretch. huh?

420
00:41:43.793 --> 00:41:47.160
Doesn't seem to be a shortage
in crime. does there?

421
00:41:47.255 --> 00:41:50.793
Well. I appreciate you reaching out.

422
00:41:50.883 --> 00:41:52.589
I'm gonna give you some background.

423
00:41:52.677 --> 00:41:55.840
Couple years ago.
I got assigned two Jane Doe cases.

424
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:58.546
Both drug-friendly truck stop prostitutes.

425
00:41:58.641 --> 00:42:03.931
Both dumped off the 1-10.
Both strangled. assaulted. bitten.

426
00:42:04.022 --> 00:42:07.230
and bodies suggestively staged
in view from the highway.

427
00:42:07.316 --> 00:42:10.274
Now. nobody wanted to touch it.

428
00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:12.602
Just an impossible to get around.

429
00:42:13.614 --> 00:42:15.229
And then another body turned up.

430
00:42:15.324 --> 00:42:18.487
And then another.

431
00:42:18.578 --> 00:42:20.489
Until we had six.

432
00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.788
And a bona fide serial killer.

433
00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:25.581
Who worked that for the bureau?

434
00:42:25.668 --> 00:42:30.128
A whip-smart analyst
with the state bureau built the profile.

435
00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:34.082
FBI gave it to a behavioral specialist
to confirm what we knew.

436
00:42:34.177 --> 00:42:37.294
White. male. truck driver. mid-30s.

437
00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:39.299
but nothing groundbreaking.

438
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.382
Some people. they just think that...

439
00:42:42.477 --> 00:42:47.722
The girls. the hookers and the druggies.
they got what they had coming.

440
00:42:47.815 --> 00:42:49.055
What do you believe?

441
00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:54.152
Hard luck in life don't make you
any less of a human.

442
00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:57.822
Everybody needs a chance
to get back on their feet.

443
00:42:59.452 --> 00:43:02.615
Few days ago. a body was discovered
up by the state line.

444
00:43:02.705 --> 00:43:06.493
Same m.O. To a t. And then
last night at the motel.

445
00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:10.452
it was still him.
but it was just rushed. improvised.

446
00:43:10.546 --> 00:43:13.253
- Why the break in routine?
- Honestly...

447
00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:17.834
I kinda think he was looking for you.

448
00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:21.217
But my question is... why?

449
00:43:22.225 --> 00:43:25.058
I started communicating a few weeks ago
through an online ad.

450
00:43:25.144 --> 00:43:28.261
Decided to meet up
at a motel in Loxley.

451
00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:32.269
Some locals jumped prematurely.
started making arrests.

452
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.399
I didn't blow my cover.
After a little more... e-flirting.

453
00:43:36.489 --> 00:43:38.901
we decided to meet up
at the oasis a few nights ago.

454
00:43:38.991 --> 00:43:41.107
and some low-level pimp
spooked him off.

455
00:43:41.202 --> 00:43:44.490
Stayed on me. though.

456
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.696
We were supposed to meet
at the mustang last night.

457
00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:50.283
- He'll be long gone by now.
- I can set him up again.

458
00:43:50.378 --> 00:43:53.495
It's too dangerous.
That'll never get authorization.

459
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:55.625
You just said that you think
he's looking for me.

460
00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:57.172
He's gonna wanna try again.

461
00:43:58.845 --> 00:44:02.337
Do you think that girl that disappeared
from the oasis is still alive?

462
00:44:02.431 --> 00:44:05.047
I don't know. Maybe.

463
00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:07.930
Okay then.
who reported her missing?

464
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.682
I got a call from her sister.
Heather Wallace.

465
00:44:13.151 --> 00:44:14.641
- Heather?
- Hmm.

466
00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:16.646
I'm the one that called.

467
00:44:23.578 --> 00:44:25.569
Are you a cop?

468
00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:27.119
Just here to help.

469
00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:29.059
- You brought her here?
- I didn't have a choice.

470
00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:32.996
I borrowed some money
from people that I thought was my friends.

471
00:44:33.087 --> 00:44:35.624
And boom. next thing you know. I'm here.

472
00:44:35.715 --> 00:44:38.923
And I was told I had
to pay it off. You know?

473
00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.875
It's not totally bad all the time.

474
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:43.712
but it's not for no 16-year-old.

475
00:44:43.806 --> 00:44:46.639
That's what I told him.
Said she's off limits.

476
00:44:48.311 --> 00:44:49.847
That shit didn't last long.

477
00:44:57.486 --> 00:45:00.774
- Who?
- The skinny fuck who runs this place.

478
00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:02.105
Calvin.

479
00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.441
Thursday the last night
that you saw your sister?

480
00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:08.744
Yeah. Calvin got his girls
fucked up on something nasty

481
00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:10.913
and had all these guys come over.

482
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.661
Said it was a group thing.

483
00:45:12.752 --> 00:45:15.368
All I remember is telling Tracey
to get the fuck out of here.

484
00:45:15.463 --> 00:45:17.044
Tracey. get out of here.

485
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:20.589
So she left. and never come back.

486
00:45:20.676 --> 00:45:22.382
Where does Calvin stay?

487
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:25.212
The room at the far end.
Since the accident.

488
00:45:25.306 --> 00:45:28.218
Got busted up in a car crash.
It's kind of funny.

489
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:29.594
Ha.

490
00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:32.426
Will you find her for me?

491
00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:34.728
Yeah. I'm just gonna go
have a chat with Calvin.

492
00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:49.618
You said... that if I'm quiet.

493
00:45:49.705 --> 00:45:52.913
and if I'm good. that you'd let me go.

494
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.912
You've been a good girl.

495
00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:03.874
Yeah. you been a good girl now.

496
00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:09.262
Oh. sweetheart.

497
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.766
You got nowhere to go.

498
00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:16.934
Better off here with me.

499
00:46:26.367 --> 00:46:28.107
How can you do this?

500
00:46:32.999 --> 00:46:35.081
You have a daughter.

501
00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:36.998
I know you do!

502
00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:40.044
- I heard her voice!
- Hey!

503
00:46:41.424 --> 00:46:43.380
Don't you talk about my daughter!

504
00:46:49.223 --> 00:46:52.215
I know. I know.

505
00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:56.098
Don't talk about my daughter.

506
00:46:56.188 --> 00:47:00.978
She was sent to this earth
to absolve me of my sins

507
00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:06.688
and bless me with a greater understanding
of eternal. holy love.

508
00:47:12.246 --> 00:47:14.407
I et it out.

509
00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:18.207
I know. I know.

510
00:47:18.294 --> 00:47:21.161
Just let it out. let it out.
It's all right.

511
00:47:21.255 --> 00:47:25.294
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

512
00:47:25.384 --> 00:47:27.545
Mm-hmm.

513
00:47:39.315 --> 00:47:40.315
That's right.

514
00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:49.071
I would never do this to my daughter.

515
00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:13.509
What?

516
00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:16.306
Um. Stacy. she told me to come see you.

517
00:48:16.394 --> 00:48:18.476
like. about a job or something.

518
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.767
Who the fuck is Stacy?

519
00:48:21.857 --> 00:48:23.142
You gotta be

520
00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:25.600
the stupidest motherfucker
in all of pensacola.

521
00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:27.130
I thought you'd be long gone by now.

522
00:48:27.154 --> 00:48:28.690
What the fuck. lady?

523
00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:30.772
I'm only gonna ask you this
one fucking time.

524
00:48:30.866 --> 00:48:33.983
- Who did you send away Thursday night?
- What?

525
00:48:34.078 --> 00:48:35.639
You said you sent my date packing
Thursday.

526
00:48:35.663 --> 00:48:38.700
- Who was he?
- Fuck if I know! I was high. man!

527
00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:42.829
How many girls' lives
can I save right now?

528
00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.232
All right. he was a truck driver
who's been around a couple times.

529
00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:46.256
That's all I know.

530
00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:47.460
All right. I went up to him.

531
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.694
asked him what the fuck was up
and he pulled off quick.

532
00:48:49.718 --> 00:48:52.460
Big Dallas told me
he had some new girl in 106.

533
00:48:52.555 --> 00:48:53.840
so I went up to see who it was.

534
00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:55.826
- And you know what the fuck happened.
- What does he look like?

535
00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:59.058
- A white truck driver!
- Who does he drive for?

536
00:48:59.145 --> 00:49:00.914
- How the fuck should I know?
- Fucking think. you twink!

537
00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:02.929
Okay. I had someone point him out.

538
00:49:03.023 --> 00:49:04.638
He tried to cuff one of my girls.

539
00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:07.058
That's it.

540
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:11.153
Lightning bolt.
He had a lightning bolt on his truck.

541
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.355
It's a pickup.

542
00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.782
If you're not gone in three days.
I'm gonna kill you.

543
00:49:14.869 --> 00:49:17.360
My daddy never beat my mom. all right?

544
00:49:19.832 --> 00:49:21.447
What?

545
00:49:21.542 --> 00:49:25.160
You said I used to watch my daddy
throw my mom around the trailer and shit.

546
00:49:26.755 --> 00:49:29.417
Only thing I ever saw my dad do
was put a 12-Gauge to his head

547
00:49:29.508 --> 00:49:33.251
and blow his brains out
in the bathtub. I was eight.

548
00:49:33.345 --> 00:49:37.930
My mom sat in the station wagon
in our garage until the gas ran out.

549
00:49:40.352 --> 00:49:43.890
We all got excuses. Calvin.

550
00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:45.016
Three days.

551
00:49:51.363 --> 00:49:52.363
Fuck!

552
00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:05.541
Man. So is this the nicest place
you could find for a going-away meal?

553
00:50:05.628 --> 00:50:07.308
- There you go. How about you?
- Thank you.

554
00:50:07.338 --> 00:50:08.578
I'm good. thank you.

555
00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:12.794
Looks like you're feeling better.

556
00:50:13.886 --> 00:50:16.047
Not as good as you.

557
00:50:16.138 --> 00:50:17.924
You look like a giddy fucking schoolgirl.

558
00:50:20.392 --> 00:50:22.792
Last couple of days have stirred up
some shit for me. though.

559
00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:24.013
I'll be honest.

560
00:50:25.105 --> 00:50:27.346
When. um...

561
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:29.978
When I was a freshman.

562
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:32.560
I got myself into a bad situation.

563
00:50:32.655 --> 00:50:35.488
And I'll spare you all the gory details.

564
00:50:35.574 --> 00:50:38.782
but basically it involved
an upperclassman.

565
00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:42.737
too much booze.
and some internal bleeding.

566
00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:46.282
My best friend got worried
and she told her mom.

567
00:50:46.377 --> 00:50:50.461
and her mom told my dad
and then it became a family issue.

568
00:50:50.548 --> 00:50:53.130
- He was a cop. right?
- Mm-hmm.

569
00:50:53.217 --> 00:50:55.583
He went after that kid
and his whole family.

570
00:50:55.678 --> 00:50:57.339
He lost his job.

571
00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:01.338
And. uh... that's when my parents
got divorced.

572
00:51:02.685 --> 00:51:03.800
I had no idea.

573
00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:06.331
Well. maybe if you ask somebody
about their life every once in a while.

574
00:51:06.355 --> 00:51:08.846
you'd know that shit.

575
00:51:08.941 --> 00:51:11.057
Fair enough.

576
00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:14.814
He and I actually started taking
taekwondo classes together after school.

577
00:51:16.865 --> 00:51:19.177
Winning tournaments gave me something
to talk to him about.

578
00:51:19.201 --> 00:51:20.566
something to share and...

579
00:51:22.538 --> 00:51:25.701
It. uh. gave me a way to make him happy.

580
00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:34.125
- I think you should leave too.
- We are leaving.

581
00:51:36.552 --> 00:51:38.213
Leave the operation.

582
00:51:40.556 --> 00:51:43.423
Get reassigned. Let me help you.

583
00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:45.758
I know this shit bothers you.

584
00:51:45.853 --> 00:51:49.095
Oh. you do? You listened to my sad story
for two fucking minutes

585
00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:51.418
and all of a sudden you think you should
tell me what I should be doing?

586
00:51:51.442 --> 00:51:53.478
Fuck that. I like doing this shit.

587
00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:56.231
I like having the opportunity
to blast these motherfuckers.

588
00:51:56.322 --> 00:51:57.778
I know why you're fucking leaving.

589
00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:00.260
What the fuck are you talking about?

590
00:52:00.284 --> 00:52:03.401
You're leaving because you're weak.
but don't project that shit onto me.

591
00:52:06.123 --> 00:52:07.283
You wanna know the truth?

592
00:52:10.919 --> 00:52:12.659
You're fucking toxic.

593
00:52:12.755 --> 00:52:16.122
If I stay. you're gonna get me killed.

594
00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:19.625
Good luck in Seattle.

595
00:52:34.443 --> 00:52:37.435
Jj

596
00:52:43.786 --> 00:52:45.697
These are gonna work like shit in there.

597
00:52:45.788 --> 00:52:49.952
Yeah. he told me he's gonna be wearing
a plaid shirt and some jeans.

598
00:52:50.042 --> 00:52:51.722
I'm supposed to meet him
at the bar at ten.

599
00:52:54.421 --> 00:52:55.752
I don't like this.

600
00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.921
This is an uncontrollable environment.

601
00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.498
Yeah. but we don't need control.

602
00:52:59.593 --> 00:53:02.130
All we need is. you know.
a fingerprint on a beer bottle

603
00:53:02.221 --> 00:53:03.741
or a cigarette butt. a strand of hair.

604
00:53:08.769 --> 00:53:11.806
The handlebar is one
of the wildest spots in the panhandle.

605
00:53:11.897 --> 00:53:15.310
Okay. Just don't blow your cover
if some guy grabs my ass.

606
00:53:15.401 --> 00:53:17.016
On.

607
00:53:17.111 --> 00:53:20.103
["Octane" by Jacob bunton playing I

608
00:53:48.142 --> 00:53:50.383
I'm in position. No sign at the bar.

609
00:54:03.532 --> 00:54:06.740
This is one fucked-up shithole.

610
00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:11.035
Hey. baby. You want a free mustache ride?

611
00:54:11.123 --> 00:54:12.238
Are you good?

612
00:54:14.626 --> 00:54:17.584
You took the wind out
of that motherfucker right there.

613
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:19.002
I told you to behave.

614
00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:21.000
This is on me.

615
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:23.047
We're always looking for a new bouncer.

616
00:54:23.135 --> 00:54:25.126
Jj

617
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:50.742
I think I got a possible hit.

618
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:52.820
That guy wearing flannel.

619
00:54:52.915 --> 00:54:55.952
he is right across the bar from you.

620
00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:01.995
Ah. shit. I think he made me.

621
00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:04.251
I'm gonna go after him. All right.

622
00:55:04.343 --> 00:55:06.254
All right. he's moving.
Hold your position.

623
00:55:08.597 --> 00:55:10.588
Hey! Hey. wait up!

624
00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:14.515
Hey. wait up! I wanna
talk to you for a sec!

625
00:55:22.569 --> 00:55:24.400
Can I get a beer. please?

626
00:55:25.906 --> 00:55:27.146
Thank you.

627
00:55:31.745 --> 00:55:34.862
- Last one for you. buddy.
- Whoo!

628
00:55:34.957 --> 00:55:38.165
Yeah!

629
00:55:39.336 --> 00:55:41.748
Best live music in north county.

630
00:55:41.839 --> 00:55:43.519
but the patrons leave a lot to be desired.

631
00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:47.654
I said wait up! I want to talk to you!

632
00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:49.669
Bro. what the fuck is this?

633
00:55:51.723 --> 00:55:53.304
State police! Don't move!

634
00:55:58.438 --> 00:56:01.555
You sure do look familiar.

635
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:02.890
Have we met?

636
00:56:05.237 --> 00:56:07.228
I'm just passing through.

637
00:56:08.282 --> 00:56:11.115
All right. You sure?

638
00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:14.819
'Cause I'd never forget
such a pretty face. Cheers.

639
00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:19.948
I didn't do nothing. man!
Why you chasing me?

640
00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:22.284
- Why you running?
- It ain't mine. man!

641
00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:23.539
Just holding for my cousin!

642
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:26.212
- Just a drop. man!
- What?

643
00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:31.544
Jj

644
00:56:36.852 --> 00:56:38.592
Get the hell out of here. all right?

645
00:56:40.981 --> 00:56:43.313
Suspect not the target!
Cover could be blown!

646
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.641
Repeat. cover could be blown!
Lombardo!

647
00:56:49.156 --> 00:56:50.896
Now...

648
00:56:50.991 --> 00:56:54.734
They got this funny
little motel down in Loxley.

649
00:56:56.872 --> 00:56:58.487
Off the I-10.

650
00:57:00.542 --> 00:57:02.749
Called the Loxley Piper inn.

651
00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:05.669
Quite the eccentric place.
you know what I'm saying?

652
00:57:05.756 --> 00:57:08.793
Excuse me. Where's
your closest bathroom?

653
00:57:11.345 --> 00:57:13.336
I ombardo! Lombardo!

654
00:57:16.058 --> 00:57:19.971
Best bet to avoid
a line right there.

655
00:57:24.608 --> 00:57:26.439
Keep the seat warm for you.

656
00:57:27.945 --> 00:57:29.355
Excuse me! Hey!

657
00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:30.902
Police! Step aside! Excuse me!

658
00:57:30.989 --> 00:57:33.321
Police! Look out. watch it!

659
00:57:38.538 --> 00:57:40.745
Crawford. I made contact with target.

660
00:57:40.832 --> 00:57:43.790
Yo. Asshole. what you think you're doing?

661
00:57:43.877 --> 00:57:45.833
All right. let him in.

662
00:57:58.350 --> 00:57:59.806
Just hang onto my arm.

663
00:58:01.853 --> 00:58:04.765
Lombardo. answer me!
Lombardo. do you copy?

664
00:58:05.774 --> 00:58:08.766
Jj

665
00:58:25.836 --> 00:58:26.916
Hey. hey. hey.

666
00:58:27.004 --> 00:58:30.292
Did you see that woman with the long
black jacket. dark brown hair?

667
00:58:30.382 --> 00:58:32.919
- Did you see her?
- Yeah. every five minutes.

668
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:34.420
Fucking al

669
00:58:36.054 --> 00:58:37.260
- yo.
- What?

670
00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:39.338
Actually. I saw her.
She was all fucked up.

671
00:58:39.433 --> 00:58:41.344
She could hardly walk.
She left with some dude.

672
00:58:41.435 --> 00:58:43.801
- With who?
- Her brother? I don't know.

673
00:58:43.895 --> 00:58:46.102
She don't have a fucking brother!

674
00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:47.625
She didn't fucking leave
with her fucking brother!

675
00:58:47.649 --> 00:58:49.355
- Hey!
- You got fucking shit for brains?

676
00:58:49.443 --> 00:58:52.651
Goddamn it! Fuck!

677
00:58:59.995 --> 00:59:02.202
- Hi.
- Lombardo?

678
00:59:02.289 --> 00:59:04.475
This is lombardo. Sorry I can't get
to the phone right now.

679
00:59:04.499 --> 00:59:05.579
But leave a message.

680
00:59:06.752 --> 00:59:08.492
Byron.

681
00:59:08.587 --> 00:59:10.356
- Oh. hey. honey.
- Baby. are you coming home?

682
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.541
- Our baby's so fussy.
- She's got a fever?

683
00:59:12.632 --> 00:59:14.247
- Yes. I need you.
- All right. well...

684
00:59:14.342 --> 00:59:16.924
I'm working late tonight.
but I'm gonna come by the house.

685
00:59:17.012 --> 00:59:18.172
- All right?
- Why?

686
00:59:18.263 --> 00:59:20.470
I'm gonna see you soon.
I'm gonna pick up a few things.

687
00:59:20.557 --> 00:59:22.718
- Okay.
- All right. I love you.

688
00:59:22.809 --> 00:59:24.640
I love you. Byron.

689
00:59:48.835 --> 00:59:50.951
Look who's awake.

690
00:59:51.046 --> 00:59:53.708
About time.

691
01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:30.324
Jj

692
01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:29.007
I'm not going through
this again. Byron James.

693
01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:34.221
We agreed that. when I got pregnant.
that this family would come first.

694
01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:36.523
We agreed that that little girl
would come first.

695
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:42.024
I don't mind being here all day
caring for your sick baby

696
01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:45.778
because I know that you're gonna walk
through that door every night.

697
01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:49.111
You gotta promise me
to always walk through that door.

698
01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:55.125
You gotta promise me that you won't leave
Bella and me alone. baby!

699
01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:58.670
Baby. baby. Hey. I promise. okay?

700
01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:02.090
I promise. I'll be back. Okay?

701
01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:04.543
But you need to trust me right now.

702
01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:07.755
And I need to go. I need to do my job.

703
01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.599
I'll be back. All right?

704
01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:13.551
That's how we do it. me and you.

705
01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:18.015
Jj

706
01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:41.922
Hey. you ever heard of Jesus?

707
01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:43.714
Enjoy. Take care.

708
01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:49.345
- Hey. Fred.
- Byron. what brings you out this way?

709
01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:52.845
- Bit of time-sensitive business.
- Mm-hmm.

710
01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:54.722
What can I do to help?

711
01:02:54.813 --> 01:02:56.599
I need to see your video
of that altercation

712
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:59.056
Thursday night from outside
your overnight lot.

713
01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.186
I gave that to the police
the next morning.

714
01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:03.189
Can't one of them local yokels
help you out?

715
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.987
I don't need to see
the mohawk's cameras. Fred.

716
01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:07.314
I need to see your cameras.

717
01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:10.116
Byron. I don't know
what you're talking about.

718
01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:11.603
I only got one set of cameras here.

719
01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.283
How long we known each other for. Fred?

720
01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:15.989
Since high school. I reckon.

721
01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:17.979
And during that time. I've looked
the other way on all types of bullshit

722
01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:19.994
that's come crawling out

723
01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:23.125
of this godforsaken cesspool
under your watch. Fred.

724
01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:27.300
And I never said a goddamn thing
or asked for anything in return. okay?

725
01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:29.218
Now. that's mostly
'cause I never liked you

726
01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:31.171
and this whole operation
makes my skin crawl.

727
01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:36.681
But I'm coming to you now and I am asking
you personally for a favor.

728
01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:39.808
Now. it's fair to assume I'd owe you one.

729
01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:42.958
Mills. can you hold down the gas station?

730
01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:44.588
- Sure. no problem.
- Follow me.

731
01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:49.397
Okay. Okay. right here.

732
01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:53.360
Okay. this fat guy
gets a little handsy with that hooker.

733
01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:55.741
And then... boom!

734
01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:57.788
This guy blasts him from behind.

735
01:03:57.876 --> 01:03:59.867
Wait. stop it there.

736
01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:02.498
- Who's that?
- Hell if I know.

737
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:09.126
Where did they go?
Where does he take her?

738
01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:12.929
I don't know. That's kind
of weird. they just disappear.

739
01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:16.304
No. no. wait. Wait. Wait.

740
01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:18.885
Stop it. There.

741
01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.346
That truck. what freight company is that?

742
01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:24.604
Looks like Southern harbor.
Yep. That's their flag.

743
01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:28.107
Whoo! Thank you. Fred!

744
01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:29.529
All right.

745
01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:42.875
Anh!

746
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:54.390
Fuck.

747
01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:11.441
Shit.

748
01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:14.403
Fucking pervert.

749
01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:17.486
Jj

750
01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:34.510
- Hello?
- Can I help you?

751
01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:37.430
I'm not sure. My name is Byron Crawford.
I'm with the fdle.

752
01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.678
I'm trying to locate
a Southern harbor driver who...

753
01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.790
That would be our customer service
department. on the other side of the dock.

754
01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:44.500
I was just hoping
you'd get logs from last week

755
01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:46.544
and see who might have passed through
the mohawk on I-10

756
01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:48.308
last Thursday evening? I know...

757
01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:50.735
Let me stop you right there. Mr. Crawford.

758
01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:53.529
I know what you're doing.
So I suggest you get a court order

759
01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.219
- and I might be able to help.
- But ma'am...

760
01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:57.199
I can appreciate the thankless

761
01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.448
and difficult nature of your job.
Mr. Crawford.

762
01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:01.871
but I will not get stuck
explaining to my boss

763
01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.620
how this information was obtained outside
the letter of the law.

764
01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.497
I completely understand. ma'am.

765
01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:09.204
I appreciate you
explaining your predicament.

766
01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.836
I appreciate you understanding.

767
01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:16.044
You know. my predicament
is that seven times in the past 26 months

768
01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:19.176
I've sat down with family members
to deliver them the news

769
01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:22.384
that their daughters.
granddaughters. nieces.

770
01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:25.687
sisters. wives. and mothers
had been brutally murdered

771
01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:28.310
and dumped like garbage
along interstate 10.

772
01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:36.440
And I can't drive out to another family...

773
01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.359
And deliver that news again.

774
01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.445
He hurts women. ma'am.

775
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.121
He hurts girls.

776
01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.951
And he's hurting someone right now.

777
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.626
Just give me a minute.
Mr. Crawford. okay?

778
01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:04.718
Jj

779
01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:07.762
Not your fragrance?

780
01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:11.475
That color sure does
look good on you. though.

781
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:16.192
Well. you're a smart one. huh?

782
01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.022
It's okay.

783
01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.694
I kinda like the smart ones.

784
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:25.622
Jj

785
01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:26.743
Shit.

786
01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:34.956
You like that dress?

787
01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:38.585
Belonged to a friend of mine...

788
01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.886
A few years ago.

789
01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:44.887
She sold the most beautiful flowers
from this little roadside stand.

790
01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:47.515
Flowers. sir?

791
01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:50.096
Man.

792
01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:56.568
She was so pretty.

793
01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:04.027
Jj

794
01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:20.543
She made me this little cute bouquet
to give to my wife.

795
01:08:22.181 --> 01:08:24.388
I kept the dress for myself.

796
01:08:26.728 --> 01:08:28.184
You can have it.

797
01:08:32.775 --> 01:08:34.356
I want you to have it.

798
01:08:35.695 --> 01:08:38.687
Jj

799
01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:45.360
That's all right.

800
01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:46.865
Shh...

801
01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:50.407
Get some sleep.

802
01:08:51.753 --> 01:08:53.209
You're gonna need it.

803
01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:58.711
- Shit.
- Hey.

804
01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.041
- Any luck?
- No.

805
01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:02.923
Couldn't find one driver that logged on
to that stretch of the I-10

806
01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:05.005
after 10am last Thursday.

807
01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:08.057
Are you sure this is everybody
that drove on Thursday?

808
01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.224
Yeah.

809
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:12.971
I truly appreciate
your willingness to help.

810
01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:16.308
- Have a good night.
- You too.

811
01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:18.358
Hey. babe.

812
01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:19.777
» - Byron? Ow you doing?

813
01:09:19.864 --> 01:09:21.729
I need you here. you promised.
Our baby...

814
01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:23.906
- She still not feeling better. huh?
- No. she's not.

815
01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.699
Urgent care should be open soon.

816
01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:27.277
- I need you here.
- All right.

817
01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:29.283
- I love you.
- I'll be home soon. I love you.

818
01:09:29.374 --> 01:09:31.160
Please take care of yourself. All right?

819
01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.666
What if a driver calls in sick?

820
01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.801
- The load just doesn't sit. right?
- Of course not.

821
01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.532
Another driver picks it up
or we have a temp driver.

822
01:09:45.556 --> 01:09:48.639
- But it would show up on that list?
- Yeah. or they wouldn't get paid.

823
01:09:48.726 --> 01:09:53.095
You know. but sometimes. supervisors.
if they've previously been drivers before.

824
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:54.770
they'll step in and run the load.

825
01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.126
But they would show up on that log?

826
01:09:56.150 --> 01:10:00.484
No. Managers are salaried. so they don't
have to submit a timesheet log.

827
01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:02.687
Well. how do you like that?

828
01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:03.646
What?

829
01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:06.357
One of our drivers has been out
on medical legve.

830
01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:09.660
A temp has run their load for the past
two weeks. but not Thursday.

831
01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:12.454
- A manager signed for the load.
- Who?

832
01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.294
Peter hillborough.

833
01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.588
Jj

834
01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:33.259
Hey. daddy. Cutting up
some wood before dinner?

835
01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:34.844
Hey there. buttercup.

836
01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:39.691
- What you doing down here?
- I wanna help with the work.

837
01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:44.479
I appreciate that. honey.

838
01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:49.614
But... you know the equipment in the shed
is very. very dangerous.

839
01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:51.569
- I know. I know.
- All right?

840
01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:53.016
I just wouldn't want one of those saws

841
01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.600
to cut your little arm off.

842
01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.784
All right.

843
01:10:57.879 --> 01:10:59.244
Come on. let's go.

844
01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:01.704
- Dinner's gonna be ready soon.
- Mm-hmm.

845
01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:08.377
Hello?

846
01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:11.010
Is somebody there?

847
01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:17.182
Tracey?

848
01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.102
Tracey. are you in here?

849
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.360
Fuck.

850
01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:26.028
Tracey. please tell me
that you're in here.

851
01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.743
I talked to Heather.

852
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:34.991
She misses you so much.

853
01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:39.120
She wants you to come back really bad.

854
01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:42.711
Tracey?

855
01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:46.048
You saw my sister?

856
01:11:48.846 --> 01:11:49.881
Yes.

857
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:56.217
Tracey. baby. are you okay? Are you hurt?

858
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:59.474
I don't know.

859
01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:04.191
My hand and...

860
01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:08.570
My stomach hurt so bad.

861
01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:14.744
He puts a needle in me
every night and I can't move.

862
01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:17.666
Tracey.

863
01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:21.376
I need you to listen
to me very carefully. Okay?

864
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:29.300
I need you to do absolutely everything
that you can to get out right now.

865
01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.674
I can't.

866
01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:34.847
I can't. he locked me in here.

867
01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:37.592
There has to be a way out.

868
01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.769
This is life and death.

869
01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:42.896
I can't.

870
01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:50.521
He's gonna kill you tonight.

871
01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:55.075
Then he's gonna put me
in that fucking thing.

872
01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:00.038
So I need you to do this.

873
01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.993
Okay? I need you to do it for Heather.

874
01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:05.078
'Cause she loves you.

875
01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:08.335
I know you're tired.

876
01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:11.463
But you're so strong
and you're gonna do this.

877
01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:15.217
Because Heather needs you to.

878
01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:18.974
Okay?

879
01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:22.978
Okay.

880
01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:30.770
Jj

881
01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.158
Saturday? Promise?

882
01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.458
I promise.

883
01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:47.582
Zoo. Willy t's. and the creamery.

884
01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:50.460
- It's a date.
- It's a date.

885
01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:51.757
Okay.

886
01:13:58.559 --> 01:14:02.268
It's time for you to get some sleep.
And I'm gonna go to work.

887
01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:03.470
Mm.

888
01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:13.521
Ah!

889
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:21.411
I love you. daddy.

890
01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:26.205
I love you too. baby.

891
01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:37.170
Ugh!

892
01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:41.091
Ah!

893
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:45.602
- See you in your dreams.
- All right.

894
01:14:47.274 --> 01:14:49.981
Get out of those clothes.
Put your pjs on for once.

895
01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:07.951
Jj

896
01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:22.809
Ah!

897
01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:37.439
Jj

898
01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:49.954
One. two...

899
01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:03.802
Three. four. five...

900
01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:11.522
Twelve. 13. 14. 15...

901
01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.698
Twenty-three. 24. 25...

902
01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.004
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

903
01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:43.804
Somebody's outside
running through the field!

904
01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:46.883
Jj

905
01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:03.570
Oh. no. Oh. no...

906
01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:07.956
Fuck!

907
01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:35.222
Tracey!

908
01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.512
Jj

909
01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:09.275
Jj

910
01:19:21.548 --> 01:19:22.754
Pensacola police

911
01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:25.207
are still seeking information
on the disappearance...

912
01:19:25.302 --> 01:19:28.669
I know what they're doing here.

913
01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.807
It's gotta be in there...

914
01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:42.228
Hello?

915
01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:46.149
Hello?

916
01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:53.908
Oh. for the love of god!

917
01:19:57.751 --> 01:20:01.414
- Let me help you.
- Help me. Please help me!

918
01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:04.588
Please!

919
01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:08.964
He has another. Please call the police.

920
01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:46.080
- Hello?
- Hi. ma'am.

921
01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:48.211
How are you?
My name is Byron Crawford.

922
01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:50.839
I was hoping to have a few words
with Peter hillborough.

923
01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:54.171
You just missed him. He went to check
on an elderly neighbor.

924
01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:56.222
On.

925
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.643
But. you know. come on in. Um. he should
be back in just a few minutes.

926
01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:02.767
Mrs. cubber!

927
01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.473
Peter hillborough.

928
01:21:04.568 --> 01:21:06.274
No. no!

929
01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:08.023
No!

930
01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:10.069
Mrs. cubber!

931
01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:11.943
No. please!

932
01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:15.197
No! No! No!

933
01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:16.287
Peter.

934
01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:19.493
How can I help you?

935
01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:22.791
I got somebody here
I believe belongs to you.

936
01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:28.338
Oh. is it Charlie?

937
01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:30.416
I just found him outside in the road.

938
01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:32.627
He almost jumped in front of my truck.

939
01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:36.339
Charlie. now you know better than that.

940
01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:37.994
- Let me bring him in.
- No. no. it's okay.

941
01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:40.246
- You don't have to do that.
- I think he might've hurt a leg.

942
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:43.979
- You don't have to do that.
- Best if I set him down. have a look.

943
01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:50.568
Well. looks like he's just fine after all.

944
01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:53.944
- Thank you. thank you for...
- Folks know you live alone.

945
01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:56.741
I just want to keep an eye out for you.

946
01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:01.822
It'd make my wife feel a lot better
if I had a look around.

947
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:04.829
Well. why don't...

948
01:22:06.296 --> 01:22:08.833
Why don't you come tomorrow?

949
01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:11.916
Jj

950
01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:15.302
I will.

951
01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:22.058
Peter. please.

952
01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:27.894
Suit yourself. Mrs. cubber.

953
01:22:48.422 --> 01:22:52.290
Wouldn't want Charlie to get to chewing
on this beautiful stitching.

954
01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.339
Look. please.

955
01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:08.188
Look. I really gotta ask you. please...

956
01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:18.324
Look. I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave. Now.

957
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:20.116
All right. Mrs. cubber.

958
01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:24.864
Yeah. You go ahead and have yourself
a good night. Mrs. cubber.

959
01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:30.827
We'll keep you in our prayers.

960
01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:39.211
Are you sure I can't
get you something to drink?

961
01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:41.422
Oh. no. ma'am. I'm all set.

962
01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:45.092
Y'all... y'all lived around here long?

963
01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:47.553
We moved out here about five years ago.

964
01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:49.980
How far away is the neighbor's place?

965
01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:52.353
- Um. about half mile. Mm.
- Half a mile.

966
01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:57.188
Wake the fuck up!

967
01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:01.359
Where the fuck'd she go?

968
01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:03.318
Huh?

969
01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:06.742
You hear me. bitch?

970
01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:11.410
Where the fuck is she?

971
01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:13.791
Tell me.

972
01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:14.997
Tell me!

973
01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:17.003
Huh?

974
01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:25.302
You know where she is. don't you?

975
01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:27.726
Don't you?

976
01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:30.976
Don't you!

977
01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:33.899
I I don't know.

978
01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:38.104
Yes. you do. Yes. you do.

979
01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:40.940
Fuck!

980
01:24:41.034 --> 01:24:42.114
Fucking bitch.

981
01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.949
Where the fuck is she?

982
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:51.082
Well. I should be going.

983
01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:52.939
Are you sure? He should
be back at any moment.

984
01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:56.421
He came for the person in the grass.

985
01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:59.295
You won't tell me. huh?

986
01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:01.627
Well...

987
01:25:21.074 --> 01:25:22.074
On.

988
01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.195
Fuck!

989
01:25:31.084 --> 01:25:32.084
Fuck!

990
01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:36.128
Oh. yes. you're gonna tell me.

991
01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:38.751
Tell me where the fuck she is.

992
01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:44.211
I'm gonna fucking tear you apart.

993
01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:47.718
I'm gonna fucking tear you apart!

994
01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:50.224
I ombardo!

995
01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:01.771
Oh...

996
01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:09.404
Well. you sure are something special.
though. aren't you?

997
01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:12.823
Fuck.

998
01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:27.095
I guess I'm gonna have
to take care of some business.

999
01:26:31.144 --> 01:26:32.850
Don't you worry.

1000
01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:34.724
We'll have our time together.

1001
01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:50.535
We'll have a little party.
Just you and me.

1002
01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:53.326
How's that sound?

1003
01:26:53.417 --> 01:26:54.623
Hmm?

1004
01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:08.754
Don't worry.

1005
01:27:08.849 --> 01:27:10.680
I ain't gonna hurt you.

1006
01:27:19.526 --> 01:27:21.232
I won't hurt you.

1007
01:27:22.696 --> 01:27:24.607
I just need you to get some sleep.

1008
01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:37.199
It's gonna be all right.

1009
01:27:37.294 --> 01:27:39.125
Just relax now.

1010
01:27:40.964 --> 01:27:42.420
It'll be dark soon.

1011
01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:46.090
It'll be dark soon. Shh...

1012
01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:49.341
I need you to be extra quiet
for me. all right?

1013
01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:52.339
Hm.

1014
01:27:58.315 --> 01:27:59.600
Shh.

1015
01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:11.824
Go to sleep.

1016
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:14.740
Shh...

1017
01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:17.368
Jj

1018
01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:33.634
Ah!

1019
01:30:13.867 --> 01:30:16.153
I can't leave you alone for one day.

1020
01:30:17.829 --> 01:30:22.914
The doctor said that your throat
has to heal before you can talk.

1021
01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:24.832
Lucky for them. huh?

1022
01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:29.664
You are the toughest son
of a bitch I've ever known.
