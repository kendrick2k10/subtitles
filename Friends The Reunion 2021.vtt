-Wait a minute. I saw that on the Discovery Channel.

540
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Yeah. About jellyfish and how if y--

541
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Eww. -Eww!

542
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
-You -- You peed on yourself?

543
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
-Eww!

544
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
-You can't say that. You don't know.

545
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain.

546
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Anyway. I-I tried.

547
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
but I couldn't.

548
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
I just couldn't bend that way. so...

549
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
-Oh. Monica looks at Joey. -Eww!

550
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
-That's right. I stepped up.

551
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
-[ Laughs ]

552
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
-She's my friend and she needed help.

553
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
If I had to. I'd pee on any one of you.

554
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Only. uh. I couldn't.

555
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
I got the stage fright.

556
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
I wanted to help.

557
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
but there was just too much pressure. so -- so I. uh --

558
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
I turned to Chandler. -[ Muffled scream ]

559
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Joey kept screaming at me. "Do it. do it. do it now."

560
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Sometimes late at night. I can still hear the screaming.

561
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
-That -- That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through the wall

562
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
to freak you out.

563
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
-And scene.

564
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
-You know. I was laughing in that scene.

565
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Do you remember the first table read ever?

566
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
That's the first time I laid eyes on any of you.

567
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
-I don't remember how -- I remember what you wore.

568
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
That's it. -That's unbelievable.

569
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
-I don't remember what the boys wore.

570
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
I do remember what Courteney and you wore.

571
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
That's it. -What did I wear?

572
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
-A white lacy hippie-ish blouse. -Oh. I was trying to be Phoebe.

573
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
-You were being Phoebe. And jeans.

574
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And Courteney had a pink babydoll tee

575
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
from Fred Segal with a white trim.

576
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
-Yeah. I just remember that's when we all met

577
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
or I remember meeting everyone the first time.

578
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
-You don't remember what I was wearing?

579
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
-I don't remember what.

580
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
but I do remember you're the first person I saw.

581
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
And I was like. "Oh. okay. That's why I've been losing out

582
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
on all of these roles over these years.

583
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
I mean. this is the good-- this is the hunk.

584
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
You know. right here. Of course he's Joey."

585
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
And then hearing all of you for the first time.

586
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
I -- that blew me away. -That's what I remember.

587
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
-I just thought everyone was so perfectly cast.

588
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
-Yeah. Yeah. -That's what I remember.

589
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
-Casting the show was really hard.

590
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
much more so than I think we expected it to be.

591
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
-We saw approximately a gazillion people.

592
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
-There are so many different scenarios

593
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
where it wasn't going to be these six people.

594
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
It would have been such a different show.

595
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
We had seen David for another role

596
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
for a pilot we'd done the year before.

597
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
-His hangdog expression stuck with us.

598
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
So when we started doing Ross. that was in our minds.

599
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
-Try to get David. David has quit television.

600
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
He's had a miserable experience doing another show.

601
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
He's moved back to Chicago to just do theater.

602
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
And we had to beg him and beseech him.

603
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
And "We wrote this for you."

604
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
-I believe we sent him gift baskets.

605
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
-I have no recollection of the gift basket.

606
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
I thought we just sent him the script.

607
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
We assured him that whatever his past experience was.

608
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
this was going to be different. we promise.

609
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
And he -- he came on board.

610
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Alright. we got one.

611
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
We saw a bunch of women who read Phoebe.

612
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
and it was nothing.

613
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
And meanwhile. my husband. Jeffrey. was writing

614
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
and producing on "Mad About You." and he said.

615
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
"Phoebe is right here playing Ursula the waitress."

616
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
-Here you go.

617
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Can I get you anything else? -No. thanks. We're fine.

618
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
-Okay. I'm just gonna go get your check. then.

619
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
-Got it right here. -Great. Okay. Right.

620
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
-You could see a lot of the beginnings of Phoebe there.

621
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
but on "Mad About You." she had more of an edge.

622
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Phoebe was a much more positive image.

623
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
-Lisa was someone who came in and nailed the audition.

624
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
She not only did everything we'd hoped.

625
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
she elevated the material.

626
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
-Lisa Kudrow was the second one

627
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
to get cast in "Friends" right after David.

628
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
And that was at the beginning. so we thought we were on a roll.

629
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And then came about two and a half months

630
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
where we cast no one.

631
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
-Matt LeBlanc. if I remember correctly.

632
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
had like $11 in his pocket when he auditioned.

633
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Maybe it was $9. but it wasn't a lot.

634
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
-We saw a lot of guys who you believed were actors.

635
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
guys who liked women. but they weren't funny.

636
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Then Matt came in and suddenly on him. the lines felt funny.

637
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
-He hadn't done an awful lot.

638
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
He'd done another show. but he hadn't done an awful lot.

639
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
-So Matt went right down to the wire.

640
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
auditioned at the network. at NBC with another actor.

641
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
and he killed it. and he got the part as Joey.

642
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
But the funny thing about it is

643
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
the other actor ended up in the show

644
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
in "The One With the Unagi."

645
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
playing Fake Joey. ironically.

646
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
-How are you  doing?

647
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
-No. no. no. no. no.

648
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
How  you  doin'?

649
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
How  you  doin'? Damn it. Carl.

650
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Go wait in the hall.

[ Cheers and applause ]

652
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
-What do you remember about the audition process?

653
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
-I remember I had gone in a bunch of times.

654
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
and I think it was on the final callback.

655
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
I had gone -- I had gone with a friend of mine to run lines

656
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
and he said. you know.

657
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
"So the show's about friends and being friends

658
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
with. you know. just a group of friends?"

659
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
I was like. "Yeah. kind of."

660
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
He goes. "Then we should go out drinking."

661
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
And I was like. "Yeah. that's a good idea."

662
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
So to make a long story short.

663
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
I woke up in the middle of the night at his apartment

664
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
and had to go to the bathroom. and I got up too fast.

665
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
And I can't believe I'm telling this.

666
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
but I kind of blacked out. as you do.

667
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
and fell face first into the toilet.

668
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And I hit my nose on the bottom of the toilet seat

669
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
and a huge. like. chunk of meat came off my nose.

670
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
And I'm looking in the mirror and it's bleeding.

671
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
I was like. "Oh. my God."

672
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
So I have to go in for the big callback.

673
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
And it's like a big. ugly scab on my nose.

674
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
And Marta Kauffman said. "What happened to your face?"

675

[ Laughter ]

676
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000

[ Cheers and applause ]

678
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
-Look at that. -Right? That's what happened.

679
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
-And. David. I know that at the time.

680
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
I think you were -- you were doing a lot of theater.

681
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
What was it about "Friends" that attracted you to it?

682
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
-Marta and David made it clear to me. made it known to me

683
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
that they had written the role of Ross with my voice in mind.

684
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And I was like. "Well. I don't understand."

685
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Ah. it's a bug. It's a bug. -Oh. no!

686
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Is it gone? -No. it's right there.

-Is it gone? -It's gone. it's gone.

694
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
-Can I just say --

695
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
-The important thing is that we dealt with it well.

696
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
-Yeah.

697
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
You even reacted to that like Phoebe.

698
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
-That was great.

699
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
That was much more entertaining than my story.

700
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
It really was.

701
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
-We were having a tough time finding Monica.

702
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
and we really saw Courteney as kind of a Rachel at the time.

703
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
-We met with Courteney Cox. and she explained to us

704
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
why she didn't think she was a Rachel

705
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
and that she herself was more of a Monica.

706
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
And she was right.

707
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Courteney brought this incredible joy to the character.

708
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
-She'd been in the Bruce Springsteen video

709
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
and with Michael J. Fox on "Family Ties."

710
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
So people knew Courteney.

we're gonna take questions from the audience.

1063

There's a lot of fans here.

1064

Has anybody got a question tonight

1065
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
for the cast of "Friends"?

1066
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Yes. there's a lady right here.

1067
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Yes. What's your question?

1068
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
-So. "Friends" was obviously amazing for all of you.

1069
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
but was there anything that you didn't like?

1070
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000
-Way to keep it positive. [ Laughter ]

1071
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Was there anything that you didn't like

1072
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
while you were shooting the show?

1073
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
-The monkey. -And the monkey.

1074
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
-Oh. the monkey. -Not Marcel. Really?

1075
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
-The monkey scared me. -I loved the monkey.

1076
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
-David was not a fan.

1077
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
-Yeah. 'cause you didn't have to touch it.

1078
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
-What? I did too. -Yeah. she did. She did.

1079
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
-Eh. See -- [ Laughter ]

1080
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
First of all. I want to say I love animals.

1081
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
I love primates.

1082
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
I have nothing against animals.

1083
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
I'm an animal lover.

1084
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000
However. I'm --

1085
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Here was my problem.

1086
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Like. the monkey.

1087
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
obviously. it was trained and it had to hit its mark

1088
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
and do its thing right at the. you know. at the perfect time.

1089
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
But what inevitably began to happen

1090
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
was we would all have choreographed.

1091
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
like. bits kind of timed out. and it would get messed up

1092
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000
because the monkey didn't do its job right.

1093
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
So we'd have to -- we'd have to -- we'd have to reset.

1094
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
We'd have to go again because the monkey

1095
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
didn't get it right. -David's so angry still.

1096
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
-So this kept happening over and over

1097
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
where we're about to do something really funny.

1098
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
But the monkey didn't hit its mark.

1099
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
so we have to start again.

1100
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
-I would like you to be more serious about this.

1101
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000
[ Laughter ]

1102
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
-That combined -- See. you didn't have to deal with it.

1103
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
And that combined with when the monkey was resting

1104
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
and just waiting for. you know. for us to roll.

1105
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
it would sit on my shoulder and the trainer would come up

1106
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
and just open and give -- give the monkey live grubs to eat.

1107
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000
So the monkey -- the monkey would be sitting on my shoulder.

1108
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
take some grubs -- take some grubs.

1109
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
like. break them in half. these squirming. live --

1110
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000
then eat it. and then he'd just go like that.

1111
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000
So I'd have monkey grubby hands all over. all over.

1112
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000
And it just wasn't -- it was -- it was time for Marcel to...

You really threw up some good answers there.

Alright. Okay. Let's go --

I think we've got another question.

Yes. There's a couple here in the audience here.

1121

1122
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000

-Eliot. Christina. I'm keen to know.

1128

what do you remember about that time?

1129

-I remember they were awfully nice to us.

1130
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
-Very down-to-earth. real people.

1131
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
-We loved it because they loved us.

1132
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000
And one day we came to work and they said.

1133
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
"The parents are here. the parents are here."

1134
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
And it was so moving.

1135
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
And we really did feel like their parents.

1136
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000
In fact. we used to worry about them quite a lot.

1137
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000
And Elliott said to me.

1138
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
"We're behaving like we're really their parents."

1139
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000
and we really did feel we were because they're so sweet.

1140
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000
-We love you. -That's incredibly sweet.

When I'm missing the kids. when I'm missing the family.

-Well. it's not like I went to Spain.

-Well. you said I had to give you the chair.

1167

You didn't say anything about the cushions.

1168

-The cushions are the essence of the chair.

-That's right. I'm taking the essence.
