00:15:39.155 --> 00:15:40.113
Yeah.Yeah.

352
00:15:40.243 --> 00:15:41.201
Mm-hmm.

353
00:15:41.505 --> 00:15:43.943
Where did it come from. anyways?A fundraiser.

354
00:15:44.813 --> 00:15:46.858
I hope it was for a good cause.It was.

355
00:15:47.294 --> 00:15:48.208
Hmm.

356
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.168
My woodworking shop.Yes. Let's try it.

357
00:15:52.908 --> 00:15:55.955
And it still doesn't work.[LAUGHS] No.

358
00:15:56.346 --> 00:15:58.653
I'm determined. It will find
its home eventually...

359
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.655
which might just be
through donation.

360
00:16:01.003 --> 00:16:02.135
Wait. you're not going
to sell it?

361
00:16:02.265 --> 00:16:03.658
It looks expensive.

362
00:16:03.788 --> 00:16:05.921
No. I'm not really
a material things type of guy.

363
00:16:06.139 --> 00:16:07.749
Could care less
if I get something for it.

364
00:16:10.012 --> 00:16:11.274
Wait. Are you making this?

365
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.320
Yeah. It's a tetrahedral.

366
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:16.236
A tetra-what?A tetrahedral kite.

367
00:16:16.366 --> 00:16:19.326
It's a pyramid kite
with different tiers.

368
00:16:19.587 --> 00:16:20.849
Ah. got it.

369
00:16:21.023 --> 00:16:22.633
Yeah. My dad made me one
when I was a kid.

370
00:16:22.764 --> 00:16:23.765
Figured I'd give it a go.

371
00:16:24.592 --> 00:16:25.462
What talent.

372
00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:27.856
Kind of runs in the family
as a hobby.

373
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.077
My dad was a kite builder--
Is a kite builder

374
00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:32.992
and taught me when I was a kid.

375
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.777
It's likely what inspired me
to become a woodworker.

376
00:16:35.907 --> 00:16:37.866
you know. crafting
and building things
from scratch.

377
00:16:39.824 --> 00:16:41.609
Are these yours. too?Yep.

378
00:16:41.957 --> 00:16:43.741
This one here
is a reclaimed piece
of Douglas fir.

379
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.179
Wow.I'm turning it into shutters
for a friend of mine.

380
00:16:46.483 --> 00:16:47.528
It's so gorgeous.

381
00:16:48.746 --> 00:16:49.965
You know. my sister
and brother-in-law

382
00:16:50.139 --> 00:16:51.967
are looking for a long
reclaimed-wood table

383
00:16:52.054 --> 00:16:53.186
for their restaurant.

384
00:16:53.534 --> 00:16:55.101
and it's their ten-year
wedding anniversary coming up.

385
00:16:55.188 --> 00:16:57.277
so maybe I could commission one
from you as a surprise for them?

386
00:16:57.364 --> 00:16:58.365
Absolutely.

387
00:16:58.539 --> 00:16:59.801
I'll just need
measurements of the place

388
00:16:59.888 --> 00:17:01.498
but I'd be more than happy to.

389
00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:04.806
Oh! Great.

390
00:17:10.855 --> 00:17:14.337
Wow. This house
is still so beautiful.

391
00:17:15.295 --> 00:17:16.687
It was certainly
my mom's dream house

392
00:17:16.774 --> 00:17:18.559
when my dad built it.[HANNAH CHUCKLES]

393
00:17:20.082 --> 00:17:21.649
I feel pretty lucky
it's mine now.

394
00:17:22.302 --> 00:17:24.130
and hopefully one day.
it will be Parker's. too.

395
00:17:25.348 --> 00:17:26.306
That's really sweet.

396
00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:30.658
Yeah. I just feel like
we're gonna be
unpacking forever.

397
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.226
I never realized
we had so much stuff.

398
00:17:33.661 --> 00:17:34.879
Well. do you want some help?

399
00:17:35.619 --> 00:17:36.838
Sure!Mm-hmm.

400
00:17:37.012 --> 00:17:38.057
[LAUGHS]

401
00:17:38.883 --> 00:17:41.886
So... a music teacher.Yeah.

402
00:17:42.452 --> 00:17:43.975
Children?No.

403
00:17:44.498 --> 00:17:46.804
I mean. someday. I hope. but...

404
00:17:48.328 --> 00:17:50.721
I meant. do you teach children?

405
00:17:51.374 --> 00:17:53.202
Oh. right. [LAUGHS]

406
00:17:53.507 --> 00:17:55.639
[CHUCKLES]Um. yes. I do.

407
00:17:55.813 --> 00:17:58.686
I teach just kids.Okay. [CHUCKLES]

408
00:18:04.474 --> 00:18:05.649
Is this Parker's mom?

409
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.521
Yeah.

410
00:18:08.478 --> 00:18:09.436
Yeah. that's her.

411
00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:13.744
She. uh... she passed
a few years ago.

412
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.791
I'm sorry.

413
00:18:17.183 --> 00:18:18.271
She's really beautiful.

414
00:18:19.315 --> 00:18:20.316
Parker looks a lot like her.

415
00:18:21.143 --> 00:18:22.144
Spitting image.

416
00:18:22.971 --> 00:18:24.451
I bet that was really hard.

417
00:18:25.408 --> 00:18:26.322
It was.

418
00:18:26.583 --> 00:18:27.889
But it's getting easier now.

419
00:18:29.412 --> 00:18:30.587
Finally. it feels like

420
00:18:30.674 --> 00:18:32.067
things are starting
to go back to normal.

421
00:18:33.329 --> 00:18:34.591
which I never thought
was possible.

422
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.028
Yeah. I bet.

423
00:18:37.942 --> 00:18:41.250
Her not being with us anymore.
the change it brought.

424
00:18:41.424 --> 00:18:43.948
it really taught Parker and I
to be happy

425
00:18:44.035 --> 00:18:45.298
and thankful for the present.

426
00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.736
Letting go of love is hard.
but...

427
00:18:49.911 --> 00:18:50.999
but I can only hope that...

428
00:18:52.392 --> 00:18:53.697
it will find its way back
one day.

429
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.353
Very philosophical. I know.
There's just... [LAUGHS]

430
00:18:57.832 --> 00:18:59.486
...things that run
through my head.

431
00:18:59.703 --> 00:19:01.618
Well. if you need help
with Parker ever...

432
00:19:02.402 --> 00:19:03.881
I am totally here to help.

433
00:19:04.882 --> 00:19:06.014
Well. I was thinking.
when you said

434
00:19:06.101 --> 00:19:07.450
that you teach music lessons...

435
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.151
well. Parker's been doing
these online singing
and dance videos.

436
00:19:12.499 --> 00:19:13.456
Oh. I know the ones.

437
00:19:13.978 --> 00:19:15.893
Yeah. and she's obsessed
with them.

438
00:19:16.459 --> 00:19:17.678
Anyway. I thought...

439
00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:20.376
it would be wise to harness
that talent.

440
00:19:20.463 --> 00:19:23.249
get her off the iPad.
and into some music lessons.

441
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.033
Maybe we could barter
for the table?

442
00:19:26.643 --> 00:19:28.210
Yeah. Although.

443
00:19:28.384 --> 00:19:30.691
I feel like I might be getting
the better end of the bargain.

444
00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:33.172
considering she's my new
go-to puppy-sitter.

445
00:19:34.956 --> 00:19:36.131
So is that a yes?

446
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.654
Absolutely.

447
00:19:49.362 --> 00:19:52.234
She was right.
Your lemonade is the best. Nana.

448
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:55.063
MARGARET: Oh. so who is
this "she" you're referring to?

449
00:19:55.455 --> 00:19:57.108
Hannah Adams.
She said to say hi.

450
00:19:57.283 --> 00:19:59.763
Hannah Adams? So talented.

451
00:19:59.894 --> 00:20:01.983
At flying kites?MARGARET: Well. that too!

452
00:20:02.113 --> 00:20:03.114
But I meant music.

453
00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:04.681
She moved next door.
didn't she?

454
00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:06.857
Seems so.Is she married?

455
00:20:07.118 --> 00:20:09.208
I don't think so.Oh. Still pretty?

456
00:20:09.817 --> 00:20:10.774
Didn't notice.

457
00:20:11.297 --> 00:20:14.604
She's very pretty. Nana.
and a super-good kite flyer.

458
00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:17.912
and she has a dog named Rusty
that she's letting me dogsit.

459
00:20:18.173 --> 00:20:20.915
Well. that sounds like
a winning combination.

460
00:20:21.002 --> 00:20:22.960
just like
my smart granddaughter.

461
00:20:23.309 --> 00:20:24.266
So how'd you meet?

462
00:20:24.788 --> 00:20:27.617
Actually. it was down
at the kite festival
registration.

463
00:20:28.052 --> 00:20:29.228
and then she came over

464
00:20:29.315 --> 00:20:30.751
after her dog wandered
over onto the beach.

465
00:20:31.404 --> 00:20:33.101
So a little visit?GAVIN: Yeah.

466
00:20:33.406 --> 00:20:34.450
I guess you could call it that.

467
00:20:35.538 --> 00:20:37.845
Want me to go get Dad?Yeah. please.

468
00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:40.064
Otherwise he'll be back there
building all day.

469
00:20:40.151 --> 00:20:42.153
if you let him.Yeah.

470
00:20:42.328 --> 00:20:44.982
Nana. could you teach me
how to make your lemonade?

471
00:20:45.113 --> 00:20:46.114
I would love to.

472
00:20:51.293 --> 00:20:53.382
Wow. What's this
we've got here?

473
00:20:53.469 --> 00:20:56.211
[CHUCKLES] "Ulysses."
single-line Delta.

474
00:20:56.733 --> 00:20:58.518
A single-line Delta?Yeah.

475
00:20:58.822 --> 00:21:01.999
It'll increase the stability
over a better wind range

476
00:21:02.086 --> 00:21:05.133
at the expense of a few degrees
of flying angle.

477
00:21:06.613 --> 00:21:08.441
Anyway. I got it started
for you.

478
00:21:08.658 --> 00:21:09.920
Thanks. Dad.

479
00:21:10.094 --> 00:21:13.576
[CHUCKLES. SIGHS]
I love this shop.

480
00:21:13.837 --> 00:21:15.883
I take it that's why
you wanted me to buy the house
from you?

481
00:21:16.187 --> 00:21:17.841
Well. maybe.

482
00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:21.105
You know I couldn't live
without it.

483
00:21:21.845 --> 00:21:23.456
But I am so glad

484
00:21:23.586 --> 00:21:27.111
that you and I are back here
building kites together again.

485
00:21:27.634 --> 00:21:29.679
The woodworking shop
will always be yours. Dad.

486
00:21:29.984 --> 00:21:31.290
Come work in here
whenever you want.

487
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.161
Aw. thanks. pal.

488
00:21:34.771 --> 00:21:35.946
And-- And by the way.

489
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.688
where did you dig up
that old chestnut?

490
00:21:38.775 --> 00:21:40.168
Found that
when we were unpacking.

491
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:41.604
Oh. boy.

492
00:21:42.083 --> 00:21:45.347
That's one of my first. I think.
Where'd you find it?

493
00:21:45.869 --> 00:21:47.306
It was in the chest
up in the attic.

494
00:21:47.393 --> 00:21:49.395
I think your mother
probably packed it away.

495
00:21:49.482 --> 00:21:51.005
You know. I lose
a lot of stuff that way.

496
00:21:51.092 --> 00:21:52.485
I'm still looking for
a tennis racquet.

497
00:21:52.615 --> 00:21:53.921
GAVIN: So I learned
something interesting

498
00:21:54.138 --> 00:21:55.009
the other day.

499
00:21:55.401 --> 00:21:56.793
Oh? What's that?

500
00:21:57.185 --> 00:21:58.404
You've been telling me
all these years

501
00:21:58.534 --> 00:22:00.144
that I was the reigning
kite champ

502
00:22:00.231 --> 00:22:03.365
when. in fact. I lost that title
a long time ago.

503
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.846
You were so proud
of that title. Gav.

504
00:22:06.194 --> 00:22:08.327
I-- I just didn't want to be
the one to let you know.

505
00:22:08.892 --> 00:22:09.850
Fair enough.

506
00:22:10.198 --> 00:22:11.547
And by the looks
of the kite you're building.

507
00:22:11.634 --> 00:22:12.635
I'm gonna do well this year.

508
00:22:13.114 --> 00:22:15.159
So you think that's your kite?

509
00:22:15.899 --> 00:22:17.814
No. no. my son.

510
00:22:17.988 --> 00:22:20.600
The days of your dear old dad
building your prize-winning kite

511
00:22:20.687 --> 00:22:22.253
are long gone.

512
00:22:22.993 --> 00:22:25.996
That will be
my granddaughter's kite.

513
00:22:26.562 --> 00:22:28.434
Parker's gonna love it.Hope so.

514
00:22:29.086 --> 00:22:30.305
Come on.
Let's go get some lunch.

515
00:22:34.831 --> 00:22:36.180
MARGARET Oh. I almost forgot.

516
00:22:36.267 --> 00:22:37.878
Did Katie Longhorn
get in touch with you

517
00:22:37.965 --> 00:22:39.227
about the transfer of the house?

518
00:22:39.532 --> 00:22:40.489
GAVIN: She did.

519
00:22:41.098 --> 00:22:43.449
and you didn't think to tell me
she was the lawyer you hired?

520
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.452
Is it a problem?GAVIN: No. It's just...

521
00:22:47.104 --> 00:22:48.367
well. you know we used to date.

522
00:22:48.541 --> 00:22:51.195
I did. I also remember
that you broke up.

523
00:22:51.892 --> 00:22:53.154
PARKER: She was your girlfriend?

524
00:22:54.285 --> 00:22:57.071
A long time ago. Parks.
when I was in high school.

00:22:57.332 --> 00:22:58.986
She had
a very strong personality.

It didn't sit well
with your father.

Or with you. as I recall. Mom.

she was good for you. is all.

out of life.

and explore. and...

735

I wanted to stay here
and be close to my family.

to New York.

the long-distance thing. but...

for money or anything.

a crummy old side chair.

looking at his stuff

possibly make from that.
