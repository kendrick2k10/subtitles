what was very much in

or how the election
environment had treated him

151
00:06:04.015 --> 00:06:05.974
because I had
seen things in the news.

152
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:10.021
And I have a lot of
friends who are Muslim-Americans

153

being discriminated against

174
00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:09.603
Several local
leaders say the incidents

175
00:07:09.777 --> 00:07:11.822
have spiked after
the presidential election.

176
00:07:11.996 --> 00:07:14.346
- [Mohammed] He told me.
"You have to respect me."

177
00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:16.610
I turned to him
and I said to him.

178
00:07:16.784 --> 00:07:19.526
"You have to respect the road.
and that's it."

179
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.136
- [Reporter]
Mohammed went around the man.

180
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.139
A block away. here at
the corner of 41st Avenue

181
00:07:24.313 --> 00:07:26.924
and Crescent Street. the
other driver began his tirade.

182
00:07:27.098 --> 00:07:29.623
- Fuck you and your family.
you terrorist fuck.

183
00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:32.582
Video all you want.
you're an Arab.

184
00:07:32.756 --> 00:07:34.976
You're a fucking loser.
sand nigger.

185
00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:40.024
- The America that I
was raised to believe in

186
00:07:40.198 --> 00:07:44.289
is very much an America
where no matter who you are.

187
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.640
as long as you
work hard and play

188
00:07:46.814 --> 00:07:48.729
by the rules.
we're all equal.

189
00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:54.909
And these types of behaviors
and xenophobic overreactions.

190
00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:57.389
especially to people
who are American citizens.

191
00:07:57.564 --> 00:08:00.828
are more
detrimental to the country

192
00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:02.656
than they are beneficial.

193
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.832
Because if you
want to radicalize

194
00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:07.878
anybody who's a Muslim.
make them feel unwanted.

195
00:08:08.052 --> 00:08:10.838
make them feel hated and
that they don't belong here.

196
00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:12.187
That's how
you're gonna recruit

197
00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:14.450
somebody who's
gonna become ISIS.

198
00:08:14.624 --> 00:08:15.886
If you want
them to not do that.

199
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.888
you just treat
them like you're equal.

200
00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:19.890
[electronic beeps]

201
00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:21.631
- Look.
I used to be a liberal.

202
00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:23.415
I used to be a
liberal like you.

203
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.505
I'm not brainwashed anymore.
homie.

204
00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:28.986
Hey. I'm a Latino
and I voted for Trump.

205
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.816
There's a lot of Trump
supporters that are in
the closet

206
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.472
or are not very
outspoken and are very silent.

207
00:08:36.646 --> 00:08:38.169
Why?

208
00:08:38.343 --> 00:08:41.216
It is because we saw the
violence that was happening

209
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.261
to Trump
supporters from the beginning.

210
00:08:43.435 --> 00:08:44.785
- Then what?
- That's good.

211
00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.134
[people shouting]

212
00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:47.483
That's a good start.
- Then what?

213
00:08:47.657 --> 00:08:48.832
Yeah.
it's a good fucking start.

214
00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:50.051
- [Cameraman]
It is a good start.

215
00:08:50.225 --> 00:08:51.052
You don't like Trump.
why?

216
00:08:51.226 --> 00:08:52.183
I'm just asking.
why?

217
00:08:52.357 --> 00:08:53.358
- I am.
- Okay. I got it.

218
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.969
All right.
that's it.

219
00:08:55.143 --> 00:08:57.754
- There's a lot of
hate on the opposition side

220
00:08:57.928 --> 00:08:59.843
coming from the
liberals and the Democrats.

221
00:09:00.017 --> 00:09:01.192
They do attack us.

222
00:09:01.366 --> 00:09:03.194
I personally
have been assaulted.

223
00:09:03.368 --> 00:09:04.631
- Got it.
[skateboard bangs]

224
00:09:04.805 --> 00:09:06.197
[people shouting] Whoa!

225
00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:08.983
- [Man] What the fuck?

226
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.029
- [Cameraman] I see
some damage on your left cheek.

227
00:09:12.203 --> 00:09:13.509
What happened?

228
00:09:13.683 --> 00:09:14.945
- He hit me with a
skateboard. - Okay. shh!

229
00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:16.904
I need it quiet
so I can hear him. go!

230
00:09:17.078 --> 00:09:18.253
- He hit me with a skateboard.
- Okay. what did he look like?

231
00:09:18.427 --> 00:09:19.950
- Shoot.
I didn't even see who hit me.

232
00:09:20.124 --> 00:09:21.648
Somebody came
right on the side.

233
00:09:21.822 --> 00:09:23.650
It's
unfortunate that these people

234
00:09:23.824 --> 00:09:26.261
have to resort to violence.
but I believe

235
00:09:26.435 --> 00:09:29.960
that they resort to violence
because that's all they have.

236
00:09:30.134 --> 00:09:33.050
They have no discussion.
they have no argument.

237
00:09:33.224 --> 00:09:36.924
they have no debate because
they are very misinformed.

238
00:09:37.098 --> 00:09:40.884
Now.
if there is or has been a case

239
00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:43.887
where there has been a Trump
supporter that has committed

240
00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:47.282
violence against the opposition.
I'm totally against it

241
00:09:47.456 --> 00:09:50.024
because that's not
what we're all about.

242
00:09:50.198 --> 00:09:51.416
That is not right.

243
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.070
We have the right
to express ourselves

244
00:09:53.244 --> 00:09:54.724
just like as
well as they do.

245
00:09:54.898 --> 00:09:56.726
[people shouting]

246
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.729
[electronic beeps]

247
00:09:59.903 --> 00:10:01.252
- It was about
a week and a half

248
00:10:01.426 --> 00:10:03.428
after the election
and I found the graffiti.

249
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.516
We saw swastikas.

250
00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:06.301
We saw Trump's name.

251
00:10:07.563 --> 00:10:09.826
We knew that this
needed to be taken care of

252
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.133
by more than just
reporting it to the park.

253
00:10:12.307 --> 00:10:15.527
So I called Senator
Daniel Squadron's office.

254
00:10:15.702 --> 00:10:17.921
He's one of our
state senators locally.

255
00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:19.401
and they got right on it.

256
00:10:19.575 --> 00:10:20.663
They got the parks
department involved.

257
00:10:20.837 --> 00:10:22.926
They had
people over right away.

258
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.450
removing the graffiti
as quickly as possible.

259
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.453
They also
organized a rally in response.

260
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:33.284
and they created
a reaction of love.

261
00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:35.722
- Thousands today
rallied here to send the message

262
00:10:35.896 --> 00:10:37.419
that hate will
not be tolerated.

263
00:10:37.593 --> 00:10:40.117
and they got some
help from a music legend.

264
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:42.424
- Keep your eyes open.
stand up for each other.

265
00:10:42.598 --> 00:10:46.297
don't be afraid to step
in or enlist the help of others

266
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:50.519
because this is
homegrown terrorism. for real.

267
00:10:50.693 --> 00:10:52.042
[crowd cheers]

268
00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:53.870
- [Reporter]
Beastie Boys' Adam Horovitz.

269
00:10:54.044 --> 00:10:55.872
better known as Ad-Rock.
leading a rally

270
00:10:56.046 --> 00:10:58.048
in Brooklyn's
Adam Yauch Park.

271
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.226
- I feel
that this election

272
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.969
has given a
voice to hateful people.

273
00:11:06.143 --> 00:11:09.407
It's one thing to be
conservative in your politics.

274
00:11:09.581 --> 00:11:13.890
but when it devolves
into truly hateful speech.

275
00:11:14.064 --> 00:11:17.546
calling people names.
telling people to go home.

276
00:11:18.503 --> 00:11:20.592
that's not
the United States

277
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.509
that I ever
imagined we lived in.

278
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.207
People are
feeling threatened.

279
00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:31.212
They no longer feel that
this a democratic safe space.

280
00:11:31.386 --> 00:11:34.868
There's a disconnect in
decency in this country now.

281
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.785
[electronic beeps]

282
00:11:45.443 --> 00:11:49.273
- I guess it was maybe
a week after the election.

283
00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:52.624
and it was a
swastika graffiti

284
00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:54.626
on the window
down at the fur place.

285
00:11:54.801 --> 00:11:57.238
- Some racist graffiti
referencing President-elect
Trump

286
00:11:57.412 --> 00:12:00.067
has been removed from a
South Philadelphia storefront.

287
00:12:00.241 --> 00:12:02.330
The graffiti.
which included swastikas

288
00:12:02.504 --> 00:12:04.724
and offensive language.
comes on the 78th anniversary

289
00:12:04.898 --> 00:12:07.422
of Kristallnacht.
when Jews were attacked.

290
00:12:12.383 --> 00:12:14.864
- People on the
block and around the area

291
00:12:15.038 --> 00:12:19.739
wrote on the sidewalk. "Accept
and protect your neighbors"

292
00:12:19.913 --> 00:12:24.918
ultimately with chalk. trying
to turn it into a positive.

293
00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:28.617
As far as this election.
I think we all thought

294
00:12:28.791 --> 00:12:30.097
people had those thoughts.

295
00:12:30.271 --> 00:12:31.576
They were all there.

296
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.578
Their ignorance
has always been there.

297
00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:37.539
and I think the scariest
thing is that now we have to.

298
00:12:37.713 --> 00:12:42.718
as a society. accept
that hatred people want to spew.

299
00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:45.895
[electronic beeps]

300
00:12:48.637 --> 00:12:52.032
- On June 2nd. 2016.
I went to a Trump rally

301
00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:55.339
in San Jose. California.
and at the Trump rally.

302
00:12:55.513 --> 00:12:57.037
I had gotten attacked.

303
00:12:57.211 --> 00:12:59.866
me and several other
dozens of Trump supporters.

304
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.042
- There were violent
clashes between protesters

305
00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:03.521
and
supporters of Donald Trump

306
00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:05.262
outside an
appearance by the candidate.

307
00:13:05.436 --> 00:13:07.047
- [Reporter]
Trump supporters leaving

308
00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:08.962
the San Jose Convention
Center were surrounded. taunted.

309
00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:11.268
and attacked by
anti-Trump protesters.

310
00:13:11.442 --> 00:13:13.793
- [David] Some punched.
some chased down and beaten.

311
00:13:13.967 --> 00:13:15.272
Others had
bottles thrown at them.

312
00:13:15.446 --> 00:13:17.884
- That's not how you
get your message across.

313
00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:20.538
is by being so
forceful and aggressive.

314
00:13:20.712 --> 00:13:23.237
You have to work with people
in order to get anything done.

315
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:25.239
- Our next guest is
a Latino Trump supporter

316
00:13:25.413 --> 00:13:27.241
who actually
attended Thursday night's rally

317
00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:30.505
and who went home with a
broken nose. a mild concussion.

318
00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:32.681
and his clothing
looking like this.

319
00:13:32.855 --> 00:13:34.335
Look at this.
just for supporting

320
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:36.816
his presidential candidate
of choice. Donald Trump.

321
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.123
[static crackles]

322
00:13:40.297 --> 00:13:43.431
- I'm trying to stay
up as they're hitting us.

323
00:13:43.605 --> 00:13:45.868
and you can just
feel the blows coming

324
00:13:46.042 --> 00:13:49.089
on every single side of
you and I could feel scratches.

325
00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:52.788
And. finally. at some point.
I knew. my survival mode.

326
00:13:52.962 --> 00:13:54.877
I had to get up and
I had to do something.

327
00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:57.314
So I turned around and
I struck and I hit one guy.

328
00:13:57.488 --> 00:14:00.056
and I could
see that fist coming

329
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.797
and it clocked
me right in the nose.

330
00:14:01.971 --> 00:14:04.278
And the blood just
started pouring like that.

331
00:14:04.452 --> 00:14:06.193
And people stood back.
I think they were in shock.

332
00:14:06.367 --> 00:14:08.543
and so I grabbed my
friend and we started running.

333
00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:10.197
running over here
to the parking garage.

334
00:14:10.371 --> 00:14:11.938
So after we're
running in here.

335
00:14:12.112 --> 00:14:16.333
thinking that we now
got away from the protesters.

336
00:14:16.507 --> 00:14:17.900
as we're walking in.
we could see

337
00:14:18.074 --> 00:14:20.468
a whole 'nother mob
down there of people.

338
00:14:20.642 --> 00:14:24.211
There was about three
cars that were waiting in line

339
00:14:24.385 --> 00:14:26.039
to come out.
but as you can see.

340
00:14:26.213 --> 00:14:29.346
there's a gate and so
people were just stopped there.

341
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.566
And now. at this point.
now the protesters see us.

342
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.960
- [Reporter] The
protesters shaking cars.

343
00:14:34.134 --> 00:14:35.309
breaking tail lights.

344
00:14:35.483 --> 00:14:37.180
[people shouting]

345
00:14:37.354 --> 00:14:39.269
- [Reporter] Protesters
attacked Trump supporters' cars

346
00:14:39.443 --> 00:14:41.619
in the parking garage
as they tried to leave.

347
00:14:41.793 --> 00:14:45.145
[people shouting]

348
00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:49.018
- They were like animals.
like monkeys on these cars.

349
00:14:49.192 --> 00:14:53.022
And I'm thinking.
just go. just go through it.

350
00:14:53.196 --> 00:14:54.850
The police
aren't doing anything.

351
00:14:56.112 --> 00:14:57.635
When we standing there.
my friend was driving

352
00:14:57.809 --> 00:14:58.898
because I couldn't drive.

353
00:14:59.072 --> 00:15:00.116
I was
lightheaded at this point

354
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.465
'cause so much
blood was coming.

355
00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:03.206
I told him.
push your pedal. go.

356
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.601
Just push the cars
and they will go out.

357
00:15:06.775 --> 00:15:10.474
You have just desperation
because am I gonna die or not?

358
00:15:10.648 --> 00:15:14.087
[dramatic orchestral music]

359
00:15:15.523 --> 00:15:17.742
It's not okay and
this can't set a precedence

360
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.570
that this is gonna
continue the next time.

361
00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:23.487
no matter who you vote for.
Hillary or Bernie or Trump.

362
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:25.881
It doesn't
matter who you vote for.

363
00:15:26.055 --> 00:15:27.230
This isn't
supposed to happen.

364
00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:30.407
[electronic beeps]

365
00:15:37.762 --> 00:15:40.374
- [Chuck] My name is
Chuck Redding. I'm 75 years old.

366
00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:43.768
and right now. it's a
good time of the year for me

367
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.684
to wrap Christmas
presents for people.

368
00:15:46.858 --> 00:15:49.600
but the circumstances
being now that it's

369
00:15:49.774 --> 00:15:53.474
a little bit rougher for
me to do it with only one hand.

370
00:15:53.648 --> 00:15:55.563
- Chuck Redding
says he was followed home

371
00:15:55.737 --> 00:15:57.434
by someone after
dropping off a friend.

372
00:15:57.608 --> 00:15:59.610
and he believes that
person was targeting him

373
00:15:59.784 --> 00:16:02.700
all because of the
stickers on the back of his car.

374
00:16:02.874 --> 00:16:04.876
- I saw him get out of
his car in my rearview mirror

375
00:16:05.051 --> 00:16:07.488
and come up and he
started beatin' on the window.

376
00:16:08.793 --> 00:16:12.406
And he said.
"Our new President says

377
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.669
that we can kill
all you faggots now."

378
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.324
Excuse me?

379
00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:22.851
It was probably
about 6:30 and I was coming

380
00:16:23.025 --> 00:16:24.418
down the main street.

381
00:16:24.592 --> 00:16:27.160
and I noticed that
this car was behind me.

382
00:16:27.334 --> 00:16:31.642
And I thought. I don't know
what this dude's problem is.

383
00:16:31.816 --> 00:16:35.037
So I stopped in the middle
of the street. windows were up.

384
00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:38.388
Unfortunately. the car door
was not locked. and he says.

385
00:16:38.562 --> 00:16:41.478
"You get what you deserve..."
or something to that effect.

386
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.873
Yanked the door open.
pulled me out.

387
00:16:45.047 --> 00:16:46.396
He had ripped my
shirt and everything.

388
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.834
and I was on the ground.
and I started to get up.

389
00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:52.315
and I jumped up and
I started to chase him.

390
00:16:52.489 --> 00:16:55.275
and while I was chasing him.
I realized that his back window

391
00:16:55.449 --> 00:16:57.190
on the
passenger side was open.

392
00:16:58.104 --> 00:17:02.195
And I was trying to
grab it and he flew backwards

393
00:17:02.369 --> 00:17:04.893
maybe 40 miles an hour.
squealing.

394
00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:08.070
and when he turned his
car to go around that curve.

395
00:17:08.244 --> 00:17:10.681
he caught me on
the side of the leg

396
00:17:10.855 --> 00:17:12.640
and knocked
me off balance.

397
00:17:12.814 --> 00:17:16.426
He didn't hurt me then but I
went down and I went down hard.

398
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.343
And this hand.
it's been over a month now.

399
00:17:20.517 --> 00:17:23.999
and it's still
not healing correctly.

400
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.436
The people who
voted for Trump have

401
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.700
no mind of their own.
I'm sorry to say that.

402
00:17:29.874 --> 00:17:31.224
I don't understand.

403
00:17:31.398 --> 00:17:33.008
The only thing
that I would ask him is.

404
00:17:33.182 --> 00:17:34.401
what did I do to you?

405
00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:36.011
Who are you?

406
00:17:36.185 --> 00:17:37.839
I don't know you.
but I must have done something

407
00:17:38.013 --> 00:17:39.928
to you for you
to hate me like this.

408
00:17:40.885 --> 00:17:43.584
[electronic beeps]

409
00:17:49.285 --> 00:17:52.723
- They have a
group called Antifa. okay?

410
00:17:52.897 --> 00:17:56.249
The Antifa's those ones
that wear all the black. okay?

411
00:17:56.423 --> 00:17:58.642
Those are the
people that are the problem.

412
00:17:58.816 --> 00:18:02.211
They are going out
attacking Trump supporters.

413
00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:04.735
I've had to hold
my composure out there

414
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:07.390
in these protests.
several times.

415
00:18:07.564 --> 00:18:08.783
I've been kicked.

416
00:18:08.957 --> 00:18:11.220
An old lady
kicked me and spit on me.

417
00:18:11.394 --> 00:18:14.876
You shouldn't put
your hands on nobody

418
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.575
because of their
own personal opinion.

419
00:18:18.749 --> 00:18:21.317
Everybody is
different in the world.

420
00:18:21.491 --> 00:18:25.495
Everybody is not gonna
agree on the same thing.

421
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:28.716
I might like green beans.
you might not like green beans.

422
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.152
but if I'm
gonna beat you up

423
00:18:30.326 --> 00:18:32.285
because you don't
like green beans. no.

424
00:18:33.286 --> 00:18:36.202
You do not attack somebody

425
00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:39.683
because of their
own personal preference.

426
00:18:39.857 --> 00:18:42.077
[train clanks]

427
00:18:42.251 --> 00:18:43.470
- It doesn't
matter if other people

428
00:18:43.644 --> 00:18:44.862
believe
different things than we do.

429
00:18:45.036 --> 00:18:47.038
We're all part of
the same community here.

430
00:18:47.213 --> 00:18:51.130
And anytime anyone
hears some intolerance

431
00:18:51.304 --> 00:18:54.785
or is aware of
some hateful behavior

432
00:18:54.959 --> 00:18:57.745
or bigoted behavior.
we should denounce it.

433
00:18:57.919 --> 00:18:59.399
If it's a crime. we
should report it to the police.

434
00:18:59.573 --> 00:19:00.965
We should contact
the elected officials.

435
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.054
In that way.
if we organize the community.

436
00:19:03.229 --> 00:19:05.187
I think there's a better
chance that people realize

437
00:19:05.361 --> 00:19:06.841
that this is
unacceptable behavior.

438
00:19:07.015 --> 00:19:08.799
- It is very
challenging to identify

439
00:19:08.973 --> 00:19:10.932
the number of discriminatory
harassment incidents

440
00:19:11.106 --> 00:19:12.716
that have
occurred since the election.

441
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.980
but it's important
information for us to have

442
00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.026
because we wanna
know what's happening

443
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.811
and where it's happening.
so that we can again be

444
00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:22.944
out in communities.
talking to people.

445
00:19:23.118 --> 00:19:26.643
seeing what the needs are
and also collecting the data.

446
00:19:26.817 --> 00:19:29.168
If these things go unreported.
we'll never have

447
00:19:29.342 --> 00:19:31.822
a true sense
of what's going on.

448
00:19:31.996 --> 00:19:34.129
- [Narrator] According to
the Southern Poverty Law Center.

449
00:19:34.303 --> 00:19:36.566
in the 10 days after
the November 8th election.

450
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.309
867 cases of
intimidation and harassment

451
00:19:40.483 --> 00:19:42.224
were reported
across the country.

452
00:19:42.398 --> 00:19:43.965
and the highest
number of incidents happened

453
00:19:44.139 --> 00:19:46.881
the day after the election.
mostly in public spaces

454
00:19:47.055 --> 00:19:49.884
and educational environments.
towards immigrants.

455
00:19:50.058 --> 00:19:52.843
black people.
and the LGBT community.

456
00:19:53.017 --> 00:19:55.194
Even though this data
goes along with publications

457
00:19:55.368 --> 00:19:57.152
from hundreds of
people on social media.

458
00:19:57.326 --> 00:19:59.110
police reports.
and news clips.

459
00:19:59.285 --> 00:20:01.983
there are still several
concerns about this research.

460
00:20:02.157 --> 00:20:04.333
The Southern
Poverty Law Center explains

461
00:20:04.507 --> 00:20:06.509
that they couldn't
verify all these incidents.

462
00:20:06.683 --> 00:20:10.383
yet news companies like
The Washington Post. USA Today.

463
00:20:10.557 --> 00:20:12.820
and other major media
immediately quoted this data

464
00:20:12.994 --> 00:20:14.822
to highlight a
spike in hate crimes.

465
00:20:14.996 --> 00:20:17.259
But most of these
incidents are not even crimes.

466
00:20:17.433 --> 00:20:20.697
They are hateful
messages but not legal crimes.

467
00:20:20.871 --> 00:20:23.352
Later in time. it was found
that several of these cases

468
00:20:23.526 --> 00:20:25.136
were not related
to Trump's election.

469
00:20:25.311 --> 00:20:27.313
and many were
made up completely.

470
00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:31.012
What's more concerning
is that in February 2017.

471
00:20:31.186 --> 00:20:33.362
ThinkProgress released
another study that reported

472
00:20:33.536 --> 00:20:36.452
261 hate
incidents across the country

473
00:20:36.626 --> 00:20:38.585
since November 9th.
and out of those.

474
00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:41.762
42% were directly
related to Trump's victory.

475
00:20:41.936 --> 00:20:44.373
Even though
ThinkProgress and SPLC have

476
00:20:44.547 --> 00:20:46.201
some differences
in their criteria.

477
00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:48.247
these numbers are
significantly different.

478
00:20:48.421 --> 00:20:49.726
All of this
information was published

479
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.250
months before
the FBI released

480
00:20:51.424 --> 00:20:53.426
their
official data from 2016.

481
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.690
which confirmed a spike
in hate crimes since 2015.

482
00:20:56.864 --> 00:20:58.257
But they
didn't find a link

483
00:20:58.431 --> 00:21:00.389
between Trump's
election and the increase.

484
00:21:00.563 --> 00:21:02.696
There is no doubt that
there were legitimate reports

485
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.350
of hate crimes
and hateful incidents

486
00:21:04.524 --> 00:21:06.961
against different people.
especially minorities.

487
00:21:07.135 --> 00:21:09.746
and even one is too many.
but hyping the data

488
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.705
and suppressing
inconvenient information

489
00:21:11.879 --> 00:21:13.750
gives a bias and
misleading perspective

490
00:21:13.924 --> 00:21:15.274
of the
post-election conflict.

491
00:21:15.448 --> 00:21:17.580
This mix of
information works as fuel

492
00:21:17.754 --> 00:21:19.930
for potential
violence in a divided America.

493
00:21:20.104 --> 00:21:22.629
And on top of this.
Trump has not addressed

494
00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:25.240
this issue well enough.
and he has been criticized

495
00:21:25.414 --> 00:21:28.112
for not taking
responsibility for his rhetoric.

496
00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:30.550
- If it helps.
I will say this.

497
00:21:30.724 --> 00:21:32.943
and I'll say it right
to the camera. stop it!

498
00:21:34.989 --> 00:21:37.470
- I think it's
correct for Donald Trump

499
00:21:37.644 --> 00:21:39.602
to say things the
way he says things.

500
00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:44.085
I think that he's
misunderstood in the way

501
00:21:44.259 --> 00:21:49.220
that he says certain things.
and I get it.

502
00:21:49.395 --> 00:21:51.440
I feel like I
get Donald Trump.

503
00:21:51.614 --> 00:21:54.138
- I've worked with
men like Donald Trump.

504
00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:56.315
Yes.
his words are brutal.

505
00:21:56.489 --> 00:22:00.014
but at least he's
honest and he's real.

506
00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:03.104
- I believe
that we need somebody

507
00:22:03.278 --> 00:22:05.498
in office
that's gonna be tough.

508
00:22:05.672 --> 00:22:10.720
that's gonna be speaking
the truth. even if it hurts.

509
00:22:11.155 --> 00:22:14.811
More than anything. I believe
that he's just being assertive

510
00:22:14.985 --> 00:22:16.726
and he's standing
up for our country.

511
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.818
- I believe that the leadership
does have a responsibility

512
00:22:22.732 --> 00:22:25.822
to unify. especially the
President of the United States

513
00:22:25.996 --> 00:22:29.130
has a responsibility
to unify the United States.

514
00:22:31.654 --> 00:22:34.004
I don't think that
they are responsible

515
00:22:34.178 --> 00:22:38.966
or should be held accountable
to the people's behavior

516
00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.230
because we all have a
choice in how we want to act.

517
00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:46.887
- If I thought Trump
was a bigot or a racist.

518
00:22:47.061 --> 00:22:49.585
I would not be supporting him.
but I don't see that.

519
00:22:49.759 --> 00:22:51.544
I see him
saying certain things

520
00:22:51.718 --> 00:22:54.460
and then having
people exaggerating it.

521
00:22:54.634 --> 00:22:56.810
- I'm sure everybody
has let somethin' slip

522
00:22:56.984 --> 00:23:00.727
out of they mouth that
they shouldn't let slip.

523
00:23:00.901 --> 00:23:03.164
a couple of
times in they life.

524
00:23:03.338 --> 00:23:07.081
So stop bein'
harsh on the man. okay?

525
00:23:07.255 --> 00:23:11.520
He has to show
a strength of power

526
00:23:11.694 --> 00:23:15.611
because if not.
those other international people

527
00:23:15.785 --> 00:23:18.484
gonna think we
have a weak President.

528
00:23:18.658 --> 00:23:22.313
a weak.
passive President. okay?

529
00:23:22.488 --> 00:23:24.446
But we need a
man that's strong

530
00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.797
and speaks his mind.
and that's what he's doing.

531
00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:33.150
- I think the
majority of the rhetoric

532
00:23:33.324 --> 00:23:36.719
out there right now
is coming from the media.

533
00:23:36.893 --> 00:23:38.808
- I'm very
angry at the media

534
00:23:38.982 --> 00:23:42.551
because they manipulate
and they deceive people.

535
00:23:42.725 --> 00:23:46.033
and it makes us
make irrational decisions.

536
00:23:46.207 --> 00:23:48.601
- I personally do
think that the media

537
00:23:48.775 --> 00:23:50.907
has also cherry-picked
things that he's said.

538
00:23:51.081 --> 00:23:52.735
And if you listen to.
for instance.

539
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:54.563
the entirety
of a certain speech

540
00:23:54.737 --> 00:23:56.739
and you listen to the
context of what he said before

541
00:23:56.913 --> 00:23:58.611
and the context
of what he said after.

542
00:23:58.785 --> 00:24:00.700
when he says certain things.
then you get

543
00:24:00.874 --> 00:24:04.965
why this one sentence that they
play over and over and over.

544
00:24:05.139 --> 00:24:08.969
on ABC News or whatever.
sounds so bad.

545
00:24:09.143 --> 00:24:11.537
but when you listen
before and after. you get it.

546
00:24:11.711 --> 00:24:13.582
- Donald
Trump and animals.

547
00:24:13.756 --> 00:24:16.019
For the last two days. the
President of the United States

548
00:24:16.193 --> 00:24:20.763
has been trying to rewrite
some people into animals.

549
00:24:20.937 --> 00:24:22.548
- We're taking
people out of the country.

550
00:24:22.722 --> 00:24:24.637
You wouldn't believe
how bad these people are.

551
00:24:24.811 --> 00:24:28.641
These aren't people.
these are animals.

552
00:24:28.815 --> 00:24:30.425
- It's no surprise
that the left-wing media

553
00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:33.602
hates President Trump.
but this next story might be

554
00:24:33.776 --> 00:24:37.388
one of the most grotesquely
irresponsible examples yet.

555
00:24:37.563 --> 00:24:39.695
During yesterday's
Sanctuary State Roundtable.

556
00:24:39.869 --> 00:24:43.046
the President was asked
about the dangerous MS-13 gang.

557
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.658
The mainstream press.
including The New York Times.

558
00:24:45.832 --> 00:24:48.530
USA Today.
Washington Post and many others.

559
00:24:48.704 --> 00:24:51.838
took Trump out of context.
suggesting he called

560
00:24:52.012 --> 00:24:55.972
all illegal immigrants animals.
not just MS-13.

561
00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:58.322
- What did the
President mean when he said

562
00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:01.282
some immigrants are not people.
they're animals?

563
00:25:01.456 --> 00:25:03.676
- The President was
very clearly referring

564
00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:08.028
to MS-13 gang members
who enter the country illegally

565
00:25:08.202 --> 00:25:11.205
and whose deportations
are hamstrung by our laws.

566
00:25:18.429 --> 00:25:20.431
- Yep. we have people
coming into the country

567
00:25:20.606 --> 00:25:23.565
or trying to come in.
we're stopping a lot of 'em.

568
00:25:23.739 --> 00:25:25.349
but we're taking
people out of the country.

569
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:28.265
You wouldn't believe
how bad these people are.

570
00:25:28.439 --> 00:25:31.312
These aren't people.
these are animals.

571
00:25:31.486 --> 00:25:34.881
- We have this bifurcated
media where people can go

572
00:25:35.055 --> 00:25:39.668
and listen and read
information that supports

573
00:25:39.842 --> 00:25:41.365
just what they
want to believe.

574
00:25:42.366 --> 00:25:47.241
So liberals can go to
MSNBC and The New York Times.

575
00:25:47.415 --> 00:25:50.505
and conservatives
can go to Fox News

576
00:25:50.679 --> 00:25:53.769
and The Wall Street Journal
and never really encounter

577
00:25:53.943 --> 00:25:57.033
the other
side of the aisle.

578
00:25:57.207 --> 00:25:58.992
Conflict is a
great business model.

579
00:25:59.166 --> 00:26:01.124
Nobody watches a television
show where everybody gets along.

580
00:26:01.298 --> 00:26:02.473
They want people to fight.

581
00:26:02.648 --> 00:26:03.866
And you can
make money that way.

582
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.738
But it's just
terrible for the country.

583
00:26:05.912 --> 00:26:08.349
It's terrible if
we're trying to establish

584
00:26:08.523 --> 00:26:12.266
a consensual view of what the
basic facts on the ground are.

585
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.920
[people shouting]

586
00:26:14.094 --> 00:26:16.575
- Racist trash!
- Breitbart is racist trash!

587
00:26:16.749 --> 00:26:17.488
- Selling fear.

588
00:26:17.663 --> 00:26:21.405
[people chattering]

589
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.538
- Stay back.

590
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.106
You're brainwashed.

591
00:27:10.324 --> 00:27:11.934
- Can you give me one
minute to just say something?

592
00:27:12.108 --> 00:27:13.370
- Yes. please.
- Yes!

593
00:27:13.544 --> 00:27:14.328
- Can you
give me one minute?

594
00:27:14.502 --> 00:27:16.199
I am not against anybody.

595
00:27:16.373 --> 00:27:18.027
Listen to me.

596
00:27:18.201 --> 00:27:20.508
You guys have the right
to protest just as they do.

597
00:27:20.682 --> 00:27:22.945
I would hope
you keep it peaceful.

598
00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:26.340
so I don't have to call a
whole squad of cops out here.

599
00:27:26.514 --> 00:27:28.559
- If you have to call-
- Hang on a second.

600
00:27:28.734 --> 00:27:29.386
No.

601
00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.172
[people shouting]

602
00:27:32.346 --> 00:27:36.698
I would rather they
patrol and do their jobs

603
00:27:36.872 --> 00:27:40.876
than to stand out here
and monitor a peaceful protest!

604
00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.705
- We're here peacefully.
- But it can only be peaceful

605
00:27:43.879 --> 00:27:46.403
if you guys keep it peaceful!
[crowd applauds]

606
00:27:46.577 --> 00:27:47.404
Okay?

607
00:27:47.578 --> 00:27:49.711
That's all I'm asking!

608
00:27:49.885 --> 00:27:51.408
- Thank you.
sir. thank you. sir.

609
00:27:51.582 --> 00:27:52.932
- All right.
thank you.

610
00:27:53.106 --> 00:27:55.108
- The media has
played an enormous role

611
00:27:55.282 --> 00:27:57.414
not only in
Trump's rise to power

612
00:27:57.588 --> 00:27:59.547
but in his
maintenance of power.

613
00:27:59.721 --> 00:28:04.726
And this was said very clearly
by the president of CBS News

614
00:28:05.161 --> 00:28:08.861
during the election campaign.
when CBS

615
00:28:09.035 --> 00:28:12.516
was criticized by
having Trump on all the time.

616
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:16.259
constantly
putting Trump's image on.

617
00:28:16.433 --> 00:28:21.700
therefore giving him more power.
activating his views

618
00:28:21.874 --> 00:28:24.137
and his
thoughts and his language

619
00:28:24.311 --> 00:28:26.792
in the brains
of people watching.

620
00:28:26.966 --> 00:28:29.664
And what the
president of CBS news said was.

621
00:28:29.838 --> 00:28:33.233
"This may be bad for the
country. but it's very.
very good

622
00:28:33.407 --> 00:28:36.279
for the profits of
CBS." and this is true.

623
00:28:36.453 --> 00:28:39.456
It turns out that when
Trump does something outrageous

624
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.850
and then the press
debates it for days.

625
00:28:42.024 --> 00:28:43.678
it turns out it
gets higher ratings.

626
00:28:43.852 --> 00:28:47.421
People watch those debates
and it's Trump all day long.

627
00:28:47.595 --> 00:28:50.163
He knows how to
control the media.

628
00:28:50.337 --> 00:28:51.860
- [Narrator]
According to MediaQuant.

629
00:28:52.034 --> 00:28:55.168
in a 12-month period
until Election Day in 2012.

630
00:28:55.342 --> 00:28:58.475
Obama received above
$1 billion in media value.

631
00:28:58.649 --> 00:29:03.785
In 2016. Hillary received 3.24
billion but fell behind Trump

632
00:29:03.959 --> 00:29:07.920
who had a total free
media value of $4.96 billion.

633
00:29:09.791 --> 00:29:12.881
[electronic beeps]

634
00:29:16.276 --> 00:29:18.452
- [Man] Shut up.
I was not talking to you!

635
00:29:18.626 --> 00:29:21.455
- [Woman] That's a Democrat
liberal acting like a fool.

636
00:29:21.629 --> 00:29:23.196
- [Man] At least I
didn't grab anybody's pussy.

637
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:24.850
- [Man] You
don't want to debate.

638
00:29:25.024 --> 00:29:27.766
You're so full of
yourself and shove people down.

639
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.811
I was listening but
you didn't let me finish.

640
00:29:29.985 --> 00:29:32.161
- No. the thing is
they would not let me finish.

641
00:29:32.335 --> 00:29:34.860
Every few seconds.
just like Donald Trump

642
00:29:35.034 --> 00:29:36.557
did to Hillary
Clinton at the debate.

643
00:29:36.731 --> 00:29:39.603
you wanted to say.
wrong this. that. the other.

644
00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:40.517
- And guess what?

645
00:29:40.691 --> 00:29:41.954
He's President now.

646
00:29:42.128 --> 00:29:43.564
It worked.
- She lost!

647
00:29:43.738 --> 00:29:45.435
- Thank you very much.
now here's the deal.

648
00:29:45.609 --> 00:29:47.220
I don't care
if you are a--

649
00:29:47.394 --> 00:29:49.309
- If you went out around
the world and you asked people.

650
00:29:49.483 --> 00:29:51.224
who's more biased.
liberals or conservatives?

651
00:29:51.398 --> 00:29:53.530
It would really depend
on who you asked. right?

652
00:29:53.704 --> 00:29:55.881
Liberals would say
conservatives are more biased.

653
00:29:56.055 --> 00:29:58.535
and conservatives would say
that liberals are more biased.

654
00:29:58.709 --> 00:30:01.060
and that's kind of the state
of the world that we're in.

655
00:30:01.234 --> 00:30:03.410
So we did a study
that's called a meta-analysis

656
00:30:03.584 --> 00:30:06.326
where you take the
results of lots of studies

657
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.589
that have been done
and you statistically combine

658
00:30:08.763 --> 00:30:10.460
the results to try
and get a better sense

659
00:30:10.634 --> 00:30:13.028
of what the
body of research says.

660
00:30:13.202 --> 00:30:15.944
We found that both
sides are biased significantly

661
00:30:16.118 --> 00:30:17.467
to sort of a
moderate extent.

662
00:30:17.641 --> 00:30:19.078
They're more
willing to accept

663
00:30:19.252 --> 00:30:20.731
a piece of information
as true if it supports

664
00:30:20.906 --> 00:30:22.864
their political
views than if it doesn't.

665
00:30:23.038 --> 00:30:25.258
And both liberals and
conservatives are biased.

666
00:30:25.432 --> 00:30:28.261
and they're biased to
almost the identical degrees.

667
00:30:28.435 --> 00:30:30.393
- Donald Trump was
actually not elected

668
00:30:30.567 --> 00:30:32.787
by the American
people because the majority

669
00:30:32.961 --> 00:30:35.398
of the American people
elected Hillary Clinton.

670
00:30:35.572 --> 00:30:36.573
It was actually-
- That's not true.

671
00:30:36.747 --> 00:30:39.620
[people shouting]

672
00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.450
- You're right.
you're right. you know what?

673
00:30:43.624 --> 00:30:44.843
You are right.
but guess...

674
00:30:45.017 --> 00:30:46.192
The popular
vote is not important.

675
00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:48.934
The electoral
votes are important.

676
00:30:49.108 --> 00:30:50.674
That's why she lost.

677
00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:55.854
Donald Trump won because
he got 307 and she got 230.

678
00:30:56.245 --> 00:30:58.944
She wasn't even
close to winning.

679
00:30:59.118 --> 00:31:03.122
She had to win to 270.
so the popular vote.

680
00:31:03.296 --> 00:31:05.428
she got the popular
vote because of California

681
00:31:05.602 --> 00:31:08.649
'cause California's
full of minorities. that's why.

682
00:31:08.823 --> 00:31:12.261
But the bottom line.
the Americans voted
for Donald Trump.

683
00:31:12.435 --> 00:31:13.828
That's why he won.

684
00:31:14.002 --> 00:31:15.438
- People think they
think like scientists

685
00:31:15.612 --> 00:31:17.440
when they really
think like lawyers.

686
00:31:17.614 --> 00:31:19.007
Scientists will
think from the ground up.

687
00:31:19.181 --> 00:31:21.183
You take sets of
facts and you follow

688
00:31:21.357 --> 00:31:22.924
those facts
wherever they lead you.

689
00:31:23.098 --> 00:31:25.666
Attorneys. on the other hand.
have some conclusion

690
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.886
that they want to reach
and then they harness facts

691
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.800
to try to
support that conclusion.

692
00:31:29.975 --> 00:31:32.064
We think about
ourselves as rational creatures

693
00:31:32.238 --> 00:31:33.761
when we're really
much more emotional.

694
00:31:33.935 --> 00:31:36.982
and those feelings change
the way we make judgments.

695
00:31:37.156 --> 00:31:40.855
Our moral evaluations
change our factual beliefs.

696
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:42.248
And when
somebody believes something

697
00:31:42.422 --> 00:31:44.511
very different
from what you believe.

698
00:31:44.685 --> 00:31:46.165
there's two sort
of common reactions.

699
00:31:46.339 --> 00:31:49.255
You must be either
stupid or you're lying

700
00:31:49.429 --> 00:31:51.692
or are deluded somehow.

701
00:31:53.607 --> 00:31:55.696
Neither of those
things are good ways

702
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.611
to make friends
and influence people.

703
00:31:57.785 --> 00:32:01.571
And that's what I think creates
a lot of conflict as well.

704
00:32:01.745 --> 00:32:04.531
Not only does it
impede progress toward policy.

705
00:32:04.705 --> 00:32:06.837
but it makes
people dislike each other

706
00:32:07.012 --> 00:32:08.361
because of these kind of.
you know.

707
00:32:08.535 --> 00:32:10.841
I can't understand
why you believe that.

708
00:32:11.016 --> 00:32:12.931
- Go away.
- Tell me. tell me right here.

709
00:32:13.105 --> 00:32:16.064
[people shouting]

710
00:32:16.238 --> 00:32:20.503
Okay. okay. she just said
to me that I don't belong here.

711
00:32:20.677 --> 00:32:21.635
I'm a citizen.

712
00:32:21.809 --> 00:32:23.028
How dare you talk to me?

713
00:32:23.202 --> 00:32:25.465
- She's a racist.
- You're a racist.

714
00:32:25.639 --> 00:32:28.424
[people shouting]

715
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.475
- Last night. we were
at Santa Monica Promenade

716
00:32:35.649 --> 00:32:38.347
where we were
gonna have an event

717
00:32:38.521 --> 00:32:40.436
where we can
engage other people.

718
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.438
We actually
had two microphones.

719
00:32:42.612 --> 00:32:46.442
and we were allowing
the liberals or the Democrats

720
00:32:46.616 --> 00:32:48.879
or the
opposition to have a voice.

721
00:32:49.054 --> 00:32:52.361
and in order that we can
debate and bring up issues.

722
00:32:52.535 --> 00:32:55.147
We are not out there to
make anybody believe anything.

723
00:32:55.321 --> 00:32:57.149
but what we found.
for the most part.

724
00:32:57.323 --> 00:32:59.760
is getting assaulted.
getting cursed out

725
00:32:59.934 --> 00:33:02.719
by the opposition.
and that's very unfortunate.

726
00:33:02.893 --> 00:33:06.723
I was very scared that
Hillary would be President

727
00:33:06.897 --> 00:33:12.773
because she wanted to bring
more illegal immigrants here.

728
00:33:12.947 --> 00:33:16.342
She also wanted to
bring Muslim refugees here.

729
00:33:16.516 --> 00:33:19.910
We know and I know
what's been happening in Europe.

730
00:33:20.085 --> 00:33:22.696
and after Donald J.
Trump became President.

731
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:27.353
I felt a lot safer
because I knew his agenda

732
00:33:27.527 --> 00:33:29.572
was to protect
the American people

733
00:33:29.746 --> 00:33:32.880
from illegal immigrants
and from Muslim refugees.

734
00:33:33.054 --> 00:33:36.927
So I very much felt
very comforted and very safe

735
00:33:37.102 --> 00:33:39.495
and till this day
that our President.

736
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:42.281
Donald J. Trump.
is gonna keep us Americans safe.

737
00:33:42.455 --> 00:33:44.326
So that's why I
feel so much necessary

738
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.459
to go out there
and continue to protest.

739
00:33:46.633 --> 00:33:49.201
continue to rally.
and continue to promote him.

740
00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:53.901
so it could be easier for
him to be reelected with facts

741
00:33:54.075 --> 00:33:57.426
and with my life experiences
and exposing the truth.

742
00:33:58.123 --> 00:34:01.691
- I think
Republicans need to be better

743
00:34:01.865 --> 00:34:05.086
at the narrative.
explaining why.

744
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.004
Oftentimes. I feel like
the values are being attacked

745
00:34:10.178 --> 00:34:13.355
from the other side. and
therefore. you have to speak up.

746
00:34:13.529 --> 00:34:15.314
When you speak up.
you need to do it

747
00:34:15.488 --> 00:34:18.012
in the right way or
else you're gonna be seen

748
00:34:18.186 --> 00:34:21.276
as the hater.
which is so untrue.

749
00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:24.279
People think Republicans
are such bad. awful people.

750
00:34:24.453 --> 00:34:26.934
We've been ridiculed.
we've been demonized.

751
00:34:27.108 --> 00:34:28.370
It's a strategy.

752
00:34:28.544 --> 00:34:31.243
We know better.
we know who we are.

753
00:34:31.417 --> 00:34:33.114
Trump needs to
be very careful.

754
00:34:33.288 --> 00:34:35.682
I think that whenever you're
putting anything out there.

755
00:34:35.856 --> 00:34:38.598
you're taking a risk
that it can be misunderstood.

756
00:34:38.772 --> 00:34:40.078
But we know how Trump is.

757
00:34:40.252 --> 00:34:41.949
We know he's
gonna be unorthodox.

758
00:34:42.123 --> 00:34:44.125
He's out there.
this is who he is.

759
00:34:44.299 --> 00:34:47.737
Basically. I think it's
the spirit of the Tea Party.

760
00:34:47.911 --> 00:34:50.175
whether you call
yourself Tea Party or not.

761
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:55.136
It's that spirit of the
Tea Party that got Trump elected

762
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.139
because we saw what
was happening on the left.

763
00:34:58.313 --> 00:35:01.011
and it was very.
very scary. and it still is.

764
00:35:01.186 --> 00:35:03.101
- I. myself.
living here in West Hollywood.

765
00:35:03.275 --> 00:35:04.754
which is a
very left-wing city.

766
00:35:04.928 --> 00:35:07.322
especially because I'm a
public safety commissioner.

767
00:35:07.496 --> 00:35:10.456
I'm an appointed official.
I've been pretty quiet.

768
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.327
I don't
express my views here.

769
00:35:12.501 --> 00:35:14.112
And the times
that I have. I get

770
00:35:14.286 --> 00:35:17.941
a lot of pushback.
and people's tempers flare.

771
00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:21.815
I think the worst comes out
in people when they feel scared.

772
00:35:21.989 --> 00:35:25.949
I'm not
personally afraid. no.

773
00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:28.778
but I'm also not going
around wearing the red hat

774
00:35:28.952 --> 00:35:30.954
or the shirt or
anything like that.

775
00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:32.652
I know where I live.

776
00:35:32.826 --> 00:35:36.743
If I did that and I
showed up at a protest march

777
00:35:36.917 --> 00:35:39.789
or something that
was against Donald Trump

778
00:35:39.963 --> 00:35:41.313
and I showed
up with my red hat.

779
00:35:41.487 --> 00:35:43.228
yeah. I'd probably
feel a little nervous.

780
00:35:43.402 --> 00:35:44.881
- Where I live.
here in the Bay Area.

781
00:35:45.055 --> 00:35:47.536
you can't go around walking.
telling people

782
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.539
that you're a Republican.
let alone a Trump supporter.

783
00:35:50.713 --> 00:35:52.280
and it
shouldn't be that way

784
00:35:52.454 --> 00:35:55.501
because the other
side can say who they were.

785
00:35:55.675 --> 00:35:58.591
When I came out when I was gay.
I told some friends.

786
00:35:58.765 --> 00:36:01.724
then I told my parents. and
then I told some family members.

787
00:36:01.898 --> 00:36:03.422
You kind of tell
people like that. you know?

788
00:36:03.596 --> 00:36:05.511
You don't come out
with this party. hi. I'm gay.

789
00:36:05.685 --> 00:36:09.558
You tell people and
so it eases in to it.

790
00:36:09.732 --> 00:36:11.212
Coming out as
a Republican is

791
00:36:11.386 --> 00:36:14.520
by far worse
than coming out as gay.

792
00:36:14.694 --> 00:36:17.436
and especially
because it happened at one time

793
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:21.744
that it was just this
influx of hate that I got.

794
00:36:21.918 --> 00:36:23.790
It was exactly what I
thought was gonna happen.

795
00:36:23.964 --> 00:36:27.446
That's why I was an
in-the-closet Republican Trump
supporter

796
00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.971
because I feared what
happened and what is happening.

797
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.368
[train clanks]

798
00:36:38.152 --> 00:36:41.460
- When people go to the polls.
they should be able to vote

799
00:36:41.634 --> 00:36:45.203
for what it is we want. but
instead we've been conditioned

800
00:36:45.377 --> 00:36:48.467
to vote against
what we're most afraid of.

801
00:36:48.641 --> 00:36:50.295
What does that
say about our democracy

802
00:36:50.469 --> 00:36:52.122
that the main
question in our mind is.

803
00:36:52.297 --> 00:36:53.646
who do we hate the most?

804
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.605
And you go and you
vote against that person.

805
00:36:56.779 --> 00:36:57.867
That does not
move us forward.

806
00:36:58.041 --> 00:37:00.130
Democracy
needs a moral compass.

807
00:37:00.305 --> 00:37:02.176
It needs a
positive agenda.

808
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.526
That's what we
need to restore by having

809
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.225
a real democracy
that's working for us.

810
00:37:07.399 --> 00:37:10.358
People are
absolutely right to be cynical

811
00:37:10.532 --> 00:37:12.447
about the
government that's been inflicted

812
00:37:12.621 --> 00:37:15.494
on everyday people.
but the solution to that

813
00:37:15.668 --> 00:37:20.281
is not to descend into darkness
and militarism and violence.

814
00:37:20.455 --> 00:37:23.632
The solution to that is
to take back our democracy

815
00:37:23.806 --> 00:37:26.026
and restore
our human values

816
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.723
on which all of
our lives depend.

817
00:37:27.897 --> 00:37:31.466
[electronic beeps]

818
00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.773
- When Newt Gingrich
became Speaker of the House

819
00:37:33.947 --> 00:37:36.602
in the early 1990s.
he sort of came in

820
00:37:36.776 --> 00:37:39.735
on this wave of
Republican revolution

821
00:37:39.909 --> 00:37:42.825
and shrank the congressional
work week to three days.

822
00:37:42.999 --> 00:37:45.785
so people stopped
living in Washington. D.C.

823
00:37:45.959 --> 00:37:48.266
And so it used to be
the case that congressist

824
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.615
people.
they were neighbors.

825
00:37:49.789 --> 00:37:51.486
Their kids
played soccer together.

826
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.879
They had
barbecues together.

827
00:37:53.053 --> 00:37:54.620
They went out and
drank beer together.

828
00:37:54.794 --> 00:37:56.752
It's harder to demonize
somebody if you know them.

829
00:37:56.926 --> 00:37:59.277
but if I've never met you.
I've barely had any contact

830
00:37:59.451 --> 00:38:01.975
with you.
that's when it's much easier

831
00:38:02.149 --> 00:38:04.369
to demonize
somebody who you don't know.

832
00:38:04.543 --> 00:38:06.806
And so those kind
of simple ideas about.

833
00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.590
well. maybe we
should expand the work week.

834
00:38:08.764 --> 00:38:10.810
maybe we should get people
living back in Washington.

835
00:38:10.984 --> 00:38:12.725
well. maybe
something like that would work.

836
00:38:12.899 --> 00:38:15.858
I think the real
problem in American politics

837
00:38:16.032 --> 00:38:17.730
is the lack
of self-awareness.

838
00:38:17.904 --> 00:38:22.778
9/11 had an effect where it
kind of brought people together.

839
00:38:22.952 --> 00:38:24.780
maybe temporarily.
but it did have

840
00:38:24.954 --> 00:38:26.434
that effect of
bringing people together.

841
00:38:26.608 --> 00:38:29.132
So an external
attack on the United States.

842
00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:31.613
historically. the sort of
thing that changes the game.

843
00:38:31.787 --> 00:38:33.354
It takes two
sides that are fighting

844
00:38:33.528 --> 00:38:35.878
against each other as
enemies and say. well. gee.

845
00:38:36.052 --> 00:38:38.533
now we have to join together
to fight a common enemy.

846
00:38:38.707 --> 00:38:40.318
Those things sort of stop

847
00:38:40.492 --> 00:38:42.320
a political polarization
that we're experiencing.

848
00:38:42.494 --> 00:38:44.409
I'm not sure that
would happen today.

849
00:38:44.583 --> 00:38:46.889
that the polarization is
so bad that's it's not clear

850
00:38:47.063 --> 00:38:50.763
that an attack on the United
States wouldn't get sucked

851
00:38:50.937 --> 00:38:53.156
into that vortex
again and get polarized.

852
00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:54.332
where the right
views it in one way

853
00:38:54.506 --> 00:38:56.029
and the left
views it another.

854
00:38:56.203 --> 00:38:58.336
and people start blaming
each other for what's happening.

855
00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:00.773
And that's what
worries me the most.

856
00:39:00.947 --> 00:39:06.300
is that we're past some
point at which external events

857
00:39:06.474 --> 00:39:10.783
can easily bring us back
together and unite the two
sides.

858
00:39:11.653 --> 00:39:13.612
[people chattering]

859
00:39:13.786 --> 00:39:16.397
- The first thing to understand
about contemporary politics

860
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:20.009
or any politics at all
is that politics is moral.

861
00:39:20.183 --> 00:39:21.533
It's about morality.

862
00:39:21.707 --> 00:39:23.622
It's about
right and wrong.

863
00:39:23.796 --> 00:39:27.974
So if anybody who's running
for office or is in politics

864
00:39:28.148 --> 00:39:31.760
says. "Here's my proposals.
do what I say".

865
00:39:31.934 --> 00:39:33.980
then the assumption
is it's right. not wrong.

866
00:39:34.154 --> 00:39:36.852
They never say.
"Do what I say because it's evil

867
00:39:37.026 --> 00:39:39.681
or it's awful or
it doesn't matter."

868
00:39:39.855 --> 00:39:43.381
The assumption is they think
it's right and that's important

869
00:39:43.555 --> 00:39:47.907
because politics has to
do with your moral worldview.

870
00:39:48.081 --> 00:39:51.737
but mostly your moral
worldview is unconscious.

871
00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:54.740
You're not always
aware of how you understand

872
00:39:54.914 --> 00:39:56.568
the world from a
moral perspective.

873
00:39:56.742 --> 00:39:59.222
You just have a
sense of right and wrong.

874
00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:01.877
even though it's being carried
out by your neural circuitry.

875
00:40:02.051 --> 00:40:03.618
The way it works is this.

876
00:40:03.792 --> 00:40:06.534
morality comes
out of family models.

877
00:40:06.708 --> 00:40:08.841
nurturant-parent
family for progressives

878
00:40:09.015 --> 00:40:11.539
and a strict-father
family for conservatives.

879
00:40:11.713 --> 00:40:14.542
A progressive family.
you have a mother and a father

880
00:40:14.716 --> 00:40:16.979
who are both
equally responsible

881
00:40:17.153 --> 00:40:19.112
for the household
and raising the child.

882
00:40:19.286 --> 00:40:21.331
They have to be empathetic
toward their children.

883
00:40:21.506 --> 00:40:24.944
And this is something that
Barack Obama said very clearly.

884
00:40:25.118 --> 00:40:28.338
that it's the duty of
parents and particularly fathers

885
00:40:28.513 --> 00:40:31.298
to make sure that they
empathize with their children

886
00:40:31.472 --> 00:40:33.953
and they teach their children
to empathize with others

887
00:40:34.127 --> 00:40:36.303
because otherwise you'll
get a generation of people

888
00:40:36.477 --> 00:40:37.870
who don't care
about anybody else.

889
00:40:38.044 --> 00:40:39.437
And that's a
very progressive view.

890
00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:41.917
Now.
the conservative worldview.

891
00:40:42.091 --> 00:40:44.964
that arises from a strict-father
family. and it says.

892
00:40:45.138 --> 00:40:47.706
father knows best.
he knows right from wrong.

893
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.578
And because he knows best.
his word is law.

894
00:40:50.752 --> 00:40:53.320
What he says is
taken as being true.

895
00:40:53.494 --> 00:40:56.671
And he has the authority
and the power within the family

896
00:40:56.845 --> 00:40:59.979
to say what's right and
wrong and to reward and punish.

897
00:41:00.153 --> 00:41:02.677
If you believe in a
strict-father morality.

898
00:41:02.851 --> 00:41:06.028
what that says is
that those who are right.

899
00:41:06.202 --> 00:41:08.204
who are most
powerful in the world.

900
00:41:08.378 --> 00:41:11.077
are powerful because
they have the right morality.

901
00:41:11.251 --> 00:41:14.036
All of that comes
out of moral worldviews.

902
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:17.431
and we see that in the
split in the country today.

903
00:41:17.605 --> 00:41:19.781
What's particularly
interesting about this

904
00:41:19.955 --> 00:41:22.784
is that a lot of people are
not strictly one or the other.

905
00:41:22.958 --> 00:41:25.395
There are people
who are called moderates.

906
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.094
A moderate is
someone who is mostly one

907
00:41:28.268 --> 00:41:30.966
but partly the other.
mostly say progressive

908
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.229
but with some
conservative views or other.

909
00:41:33.403 --> 00:41:35.449
But there's no
worldview of the moderate

910
00:41:35.623 --> 00:41:36.755
that all
moderates agree on.

911
00:41:36.929 --> 00:41:38.539
There's no center.

912
00:41:38.713 --> 00:41:40.541
Now. how can you have
contradictory moral worldviews

913
00:41:40.715 --> 00:41:41.847
in a single brain?

914
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:43.631
And the
answer is very simple.

915
00:41:43.805 --> 00:41:46.678
Each worldview. when turned on.
turns the other one off.

916
00:41:46.852 --> 00:41:49.419
Language activates a
given moral worldview.

917
00:41:49.594 --> 00:41:52.074
and the more you hear it.
the stronger it gets.

918
00:41:52.248 --> 00:41:55.817
What that means is that
if you are constantly exposed

919
00:41:55.991 --> 00:41:59.647
to conservative discourse.
if you start out as a Democrat.

920
00:41:59.821 --> 00:42:01.649
you'll be moving
more and more to the right.

921
00:42:01.823 --> 00:42:03.433
What is Trump about?

922
00:42:03.608 --> 00:42:06.524
He obviously has strict-father
values and he wants to be

923
00:42:06.698 --> 00:42:09.004
the most powerful
strict father in the world.

924
00:42:09.178 --> 00:42:10.919
It means that he believes

925
00:42:11.093 --> 00:42:12.965
that the world
should be run his way.

926
00:42:13.139 --> 00:42:14.575
In order for
that to happen.

927
00:42:14.749 --> 00:42:17.491
he has to maintain his
income and being popular.

928
00:42:17.665 --> 00:42:20.450
And it doesn't matter what
his connections to Russia are.

929
00:42:20.625 --> 00:42:23.062
It doesn't matter whether
he tells the truth or not.

930
00:42:23.236 --> 00:42:26.544
All those things
are secondary to the idea

931
00:42:26.718 --> 00:42:28.502
that America
is going to be run

932
00:42:28.676 --> 00:42:31.244
the way you morally
think it should be run.

933
00:42:31.418 --> 00:42:33.551
That is what
Trump supporters believe.

934
00:42:33.725 --> 00:42:36.336
Under Obama.
those folks lived in a country

935
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:39.034
where the President
was against their world views

936
00:42:39.208 --> 00:42:41.036
and.
therefore. their identity.

937
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.778
And similarly. progressives.
when Trump was elected

938
00:42:43.952 --> 00:42:46.302
and given what he's done.
feel oppressed as well.

939
00:42:46.476 --> 00:42:48.522
There is a
resistance out there.

940
00:42:48.696 --> 00:42:51.569
There is a large
movement to change this.

941
00:42:51.743 --> 00:42:53.005
Why?

942
00:42:53.179 --> 00:42:55.050
Because people
feel that they must do

943
00:42:55.224 --> 00:42:56.704
something to change it.

944
00:42:56.878 --> 00:42:59.228
They feel
oppressed to such a degree

945
00:42:59.402 --> 00:43:02.449
that they feel democracy
is being taken away from them.

946
00:43:02.623 --> 00:43:05.931
and everything they
value is being taken away.

947
00:43:06.105 --> 00:43:07.933
and they have
to do something.

948
00:43:08.107 --> 00:43:09.848
- [Man] Excuse my language.
but on three.

949
00:43:10.022 --> 00:43:11.327
we gonna say.
fuck Trump!

950
00:43:11.501 --> 00:43:12.415
One. two.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.678

[crowd cheers]

957
00:43:21.033 --> 00:43:23.688
- [Narrator] Following
Trump's election. large protests

958
00:43:23.862 --> 00:43:26.342
were held in several major
cities across the United States

959
00:43:26.516 --> 00:43:28.518
and in some
countries around the world.

960
00:43:28.693 --> 00:43:31.347
Thousands of protesters
participated in each city

961
00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:34.612
in the form of walkouts.
business closures. petitions.

962
00:43:34.786 --> 00:43:37.179
rallies.
demonstrations. and marches.

964
00:43:38.746 --> 00:43:39.617

Not my President.
not my President!

967
00:43:48.974 --> 00:43:50.932
- [Narrator] According
to Crowd Counting Consortium.

968
00:43:51.106 --> 00:43:54.719
only in 2017.
it is estimated that between six

969
00:43:54.893 --> 00:43:57.678
and nine million
people protested in the U.S..

970
00:43:57.852 --> 00:44:01.987
and 89% of these people were
protesting Trump or his agenda.

971
00:44:02.161 --> 00:44:04.903
Since the
Women's March in 2017.

972
00:44:05.077 --> 00:44:06.992
which is considered the
biggest single-day protest

973
00:44:07.166 --> 00:44:09.777
in the history of the U.S..
until the end of that year.

974
00:44:09.951 --> 00:44:13.085
over 8.700
protests were listed.

975
00:44:14.086 --> 00:44:16.088

00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:43.305
- What I
learned at Standing Rock

998
00:45:43.479 --> 00:45:47.657
is that when people are united.
not in anger. not in hatred.

999
00:45:47.832 --> 00:45:52.532
but with love. there is no
challenge we cannot overcome!

1000
00:45:52.706 --> 00:45:56.536
We do not need to
resist because we are standing.

1001
00:45:57.537 --> 00:45:59.757
Raise your hand
if you're standing.

1002
00:45:59.931 --> 00:46:01.410
Raise your hand
if you're standing.

00:46:11.116 --> 00:46:13.509
There are
warriors in our households.

We are here to fight!

1008
00:46:15.816 --> 00:46:17.513
Donald Trump
doesn't give a damn

1009
00:46:17.687 --> 00:46:20.734
about whether or not you can
take your child to the doctor.

1010
00:46:20.908 --> 00:46:22.388
This is about money!

1011
00:46:22.562 --> 00:46:27.393
The $500 billion
that are supposed to be cut

1012
00:46:27.567 --> 00:46:29.917
out of the
spending for Obamacare

1013
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:34.966
is $500 billion worth
of tax rebates that are going

1014
00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:38.317
back to the richest
corporations in this nation.

1015
00:46:38.491 --> 00:46:40.667
- Do you
believe that healthcare

1016
00:46:40.841 --> 00:46:43.191
is a
fundamental human right?

00:46:45.585 --> 00:46:48.588
Then we're here
today to save Obamacare.

1019
00:46:48.762 --> 00:46:50.677
and this is
just the beginning.

1020
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:52.505
We're just
starting the fight.

1021
00:46:52.679 --> 00:46:54.028
Today's the kickoff.

1022
00:46:54.202 --> 00:46:56.378
Get ready.
we're gonna go to work!

1023
00:46:56.552 --> 00:47:00.469
[crowd cheers]
[horn blares]

1024
00:47:00.643 --> 00:47:03.472
The fact that
thousands of people.

1025
00:47:03.646 --> 00:47:05.823
with very little notice.
came out into the streets

1026
00:47:05.997 --> 00:47:08.260
of Los
Angeles to demonstrate

1027
00:47:08.434 --> 00:47:10.044
in favor of the
Affordable Care Act

1028
00:47:10.218 --> 00:47:12.917
and against
Trumpcare is not insignificant.

1029
00:47:13.091 --> 00:47:15.354
and we're only
gonna build on that.

1030
00:47:15.528 --> 00:47:18.748
We are gonna continue to fight
for health as a human right.

1031
00:47:18.923 --> 00:47:21.664
I think since
Donald Trump's election.

1032
00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:24.798
there has been a
significant increase in fear

1033
00:47:24.972 --> 00:47:27.627
in the communities that
we serve in South Los Angeles.

1034
00:47:27.801 --> 00:47:29.759
St. John's Well
Child and Family Center

1035
00:47:29.934 --> 00:47:32.632
is the largest
provider of healthcare services

1036
00:47:32.806 --> 00:47:35.461
to undocumented
immigrants in the United States.

1037
00:47:35.635 --> 00:47:38.159
so obviously
we feel like we're

1038
00:47:38.333 --> 00:47:41.380
at the epicenter
of all the anxiety

1039
00:47:41.554 --> 00:47:44.296
that's been created as
a result of the election.

1040
00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:48.343
Many of our patients
are becoming depressed.

1041
00:47:48.517 --> 00:47:50.084
They're worried.

1042
00:47:50.258 --> 00:47:51.303
Many. many people are
afraid that they're gonna be

1043
00:47:51.477 --> 00:47:53.131
separated
from their families.

1044
00:47:53.305 --> 00:47:55.611
So we've been providing
a lot of behavior health

1045
00:47:55.785 --> 00:47:58.005
and mental health
counseling to our patients

1046
00:47:58.179 --> 00:48:01.704
as well as just general
education for them to know

1047
00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:05.099
their rights. so that we
can reduce that anxiety level.

1048
00:48:05.273 --> 00:48:08.102
We're not asking for
Trump voters to send us money.

1049
00:48:08.276 --> 00:48:09.930
There are plenty
of other folks who make

1050
00:48:10.104 --> 00:48:12.715
contributions to
St. John's as a charity

1051
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.196
and support
providing healthcare to the poor

1052
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.895
and to the undocumented
and to the immigrant.

1053
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:19.853
We're gonna have to
keep building the resistance

1054
00:48:20.027 --> 00:48:21.768
to taking away
people's healthcare

1055
00:48:21.942 --> 00:48:24.684
and continue to
build a constituency

1056
00:48:24.858 --> 00:48:27.078
so that people
understand that healthcare is

1057
00:48:27.252 --> 00:48:29.471
an important right and
that people will fight for it.

1058
00:48:29.645 --> 00:48:31.560
[bus rumbles]
[brakes squeaking]

1059
00:48:31.734 --> 00:48:34.694
[electronic beeps]

1060
00:48:59.588 --> 00:49:03.244
- One of the things that began
to come out of the rhetoric

1061
00:49:03.418 --> 00:49:05.681
during the campaign
were some of the young people

1062
00:49:05.855 --> 00:49:08.510
were going to school
and they asked the teachers

1063
00:49:08.684 --> 00:49:12.166
the question. "Does that
mean I got to leave my home?"

1064
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.257
And even some of the kids. what
they heard around the table.

1065
00:49:16.431 --> 00:49:19.478
they would come to school
and they would talk about it.

1066
00:49:19.652 --> 00:49:22.437
We have to
educate our children.

1067
00:49:23.873 --> 00:49:26.224
We got to let
them know there are

1068
00:49:26.398 --> 00:49:30.054
hateful words
that people use

1069
00:49:30.228 --> 00:49:32.708
and they don't even
understand the meaning of 'em.

1070
00:49:33.579 --> 00:49:38.453
They repeat them because
their parents spoke them.

1071
00:49:40.064 --> 00:49:46.113
Parents must become held
accountable for what they say.

1072
00:49:46.287 --> 00:49:50.248
We got to stop allowing
hatred to be resuscitated.

1073
00:49:50.422 --> 00:49:53.077
We gotta
continue to speak peace.

1074
00:49:53.251 --> 00:49:55.166
and so it is
about participation.

1075
00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:58.256
collaboration.
and having that conversation

1076
00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:02.477
and become engaged in
the politics around you.

1077
00:50:02.651 --> 00:50:07.613
[vehicles rumbling]
[contemplative synth music]

1078
00:50:09.354 --> 00:50:12.313
- I think I speak on
behalf of a lot of caring

1079
00:50:12.487 --> 00:50:14.707
and thinking people in North
Carolina and around the country

1080
00:50:14.881 --> 00:50:18.928
when we say we're very
fearful of a Trump presidency.

1081
00:50:20.713 --> 00:50:23.150
I'm not embarrassed to
say that I cried my eyes out

1082
00:50:23.324 --> 00:50:25.283
at three o'clock in the morning
after the election result.

1083
00:50:25.457 --> 00:50:27.198
So though I work for a
nonpartisan organization.

1084
00:50:27.372 --> 00:50:29.461
we don't endorse candidates.
I have

1085
00:50:29.635 --> 00:50:33.465
very strong feelings personally
about our country's future

1086
00:50:33.639 --> 00:50:37.338
and deep-seated fears about
what a Trump presidency means.

1087
00:50:37.512 --> 00:50:39.949
It's a remarkable
position for a politician

1088
00:50:40.124 --> 00:50:43.170
to find him or herself in.
and frightening.

1089
00:50:43.344 --> 00:50:45.129
I suppose. in some
respects for the rest of us

1090
00:50:45.303 --> 00:50:50.830
that people are so seemingly
intensely loyal to this man

1091
00:50:51.004 --> 00:50:53.920
that they're willing to
cheer him when he says one thing

1092
00:50:54.094 --> 00:50:57.445
and then when he says the
opposite. to cheer him as well.

1093
00:50:57.619 --> 00:50:59.317
But I don't think it
should surprise any of us.

1094
00:50:59.491 --> 00:51:04.583
The man has been a
charlatan and a salesman

1095
00:51:04.757 --> 00:51:09.370
his whole life. and has
made it sort of a faith for him

1096
00:51:09.544 --> 00:51:13.026
that he says whatever it
takes to get whatever he wants.

1097
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.201
When you're
talking about the KKK

1098
00:51:14.375 --> 00:51:16.377
and other
racist hate groups.

1099
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:19.728
North Carolina has a long.
troubled history.

1100
00:51:19.902 --> 00:51:22.644
It's depressing and of
concern that groups like that

1101
00:51:22.818 --> 00:51:24.994
would feel at all empowered.
but the rise of Donald Trump

1102
00:51:25.169 --> 00:51:26.822
has given at least
some of those people

1103
00:51:26.996 --> 00:51:29.390
a feeling that they
are now free to come forth

1104
00:51:29.564 --> 00:51:33.307
and spew vitriol and
hate towards other people.

1105
00:51:33.481 --> 00:51:35.570
- Virginia's governor
declared a state of emergency

1106
00:51:35.744 --> 00:51:37.746
in Charlottesville
today as white nationalists

1107
00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:41.098
clashed in the streets
with counter-protesters.

1108
00:51:41.272 --> 00:51:43.926
Groups. including the
Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis.

1109
00:51:44.101 --> 00:51:46.364
came from across
the country to rally

1110
00:51:46.538 --> 00:51:50.063
against plans to remove a
Confederate statue from a park.

1111
00:51:50.237 --> 00:51:52.239
The violence
included an apparent attack

1112
00:51:52.413 --> 00:51:55.503
with a car on a crowd
of peaceful protesters.

1113
00:51:55.677 --> 00:51:57.592
At least one
person was killed.

1114
00:51:57.766 --> 00:51:59.681
This all took
place a short distance

1115
00:51:59.855 --> 00:52:01.161
from the
University of Virginia.

1116
00:52:01.335 --> 00:52:03.250
- Incidents
today were predated

1117
00:52:03.424 --> 00:52:05.818
by three other
major rallies there.

1118
00:52:05.992 --> 00:52:07.646
Last night. torch-wielding
white supremacists

1119
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:09.952
marched through the
University of Virginia campus.

1120
00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:14.043
In July. 50 members of a
North-Carolina-based KKK group

1121
00:52:14.218 --> 00:52:16.133
traveled to
Charlottesville for a rally.

1122
00:52:16.307 --> 00:52:19.005
where they were met by
hundreds of counter-protesters.

1123
00:52:19.179 --> 00:52:21.094
And in May.
prominent white nationalist

1124
00:52:21.268 --> 00:52:23.444
Richard Spencer
protested there as well.

1125
00:52:23.618 --> 00:52:26.795
- We condemn in the
strongest possible terms

1126
00:52:27.927 --> 00:52:31.496
this egregious
display of hatred. bigotry.

1127
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:34.368
and violence on many sides.
on many sides.

1128
00:52:34.542 --> 00:52:36.849
- [Woman] Are you putting
what you're calling the alt-left

1129
00:52:37.023 --> 00:52:39.982
and white supremacists
on the same moral plane?

1130
00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:41.854
- I'm not putting
anybody on a moral plane.

1131
00:52:42.028 --> 00:52:44.683
What I'm saying is this.
you had a group on one side

1132
00:52:44.857 --> 00:52:46.075
and you had a
group on the other.

1133
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:47.903
and they came at
each other with clubs

1134
00:52:48.077 --> 00:52:50.384
and it was vicious and
it was horrible and it was

1135
00:52:50.558 --> 00:52:53.735
a horrible thing to watch.
but there is another side.

1136
00:52:53.909 --> 00:52:56.782
There was a group on this side.
you can call them the left.

1137
00:52:56.956 --> 00:52:58.523
you've just
called them the left.

1138
00:52:58.697 --> 00:53:01.787
that came violently
attacking the other group.

1139
00:53:01.961 --> 00:53:05.182
So you can say what you want.
but that's the way it is.

1140
00:53:05.356 --> 00:53:07.271
- In some respects.
when you talk about hate groups

1141
00:53:07.445 --> 00:53:09.882
like the Klan and
other racist outfits.

1142
00:53:10.056 --> 00:53:11.840
they've always sort of
been there under the surface.

1143
00:53:12.014 --> 00:53:14.452
so an optimist might say.
well. at least Trump

1144
00:53:14.626 --> 00:53:17.672
has helped force them out
into the open so they're there.

1145
00:53:17.846 --> 00:53:19.152
We're gonna combat them.

1146
00:53:19.326 --> 00:53:20.980
We're gonna not
pretend they don't exist.

1147
00:53:21.154 --> 00:53:23.983
We're gonna have
to engage and explain

1148
00:53:24.157 --> 00:53:29.162
and expose these people as
being wrongheaded and ignorant.

1149
00:53:29.815 --> 00:53:32.731
And I suppose that's
my hope that will happen.

1150
00:53:32.905 --> 00:53:35.037
that by forcing
them out into the open.

1151
00:53:35.212 --> 00:53:38.432
we'll be able to
shine a light on this cancer

1152
00:53:38.606 --> 00:53:41.348
and see that it
ultimately dies off.

1153
00:53:41.522 --> 00:53:46.353
But it's gonna take a while.
so these are challenging times.

1154
00:53:46.527 --> 00:53:47.963
[dramatic synth music]

1155
00:53:48.137 --> 00:53:51.010
- [Crowd] No Trump.
no KKK. no fascist USA!

1156
00:53:51.184 --> 00:53:55.014
No Trump.
no KKK. no fascist USA!

1157
00:53:55.188 --> 00:53:58.626
No Trump.
no KKK. no fascist USA!

1158
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.628
No Trump. no KKK!
[explosion booms]

1159
00:54:00.802 --> 00:54:02.151
No fascist USA!

1160
00:54:02.326 --> 00:54:06.199
[people shouting]
No Trump!

1161
00:54:06.373 --> 00:54:09.028
[explosion booms]

1162
00:54:09.202 --> 00:54:12.640
- People are experiencing
a big wake-up moment right now.

1163
00:54:12.814 --> 00:54:15.469
and we see millions of
people out in the streets

1164
00:54:15.643 --> 00:54:17.776
like we haven't
seen in generations.

1165
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:20.126
I think people feel
like they have been thrown

1166
00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.694
under the bus.
and this is when people become

1167
00:54:22.868 --> 00:54:26.306
very susceptible to
demagogues and to fascism.

1168
00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.570
This is how
fascism has always risen.

1169
00:54:29.744 --> 00:54:33.008
when people are
very economically stressed

1170
00:54:33.182 --> 00:54:35.576
and they've lost faith
in our social institutions

1171
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:37.186
and our
institutions of government.

1172
00:54:37.361 --> 00:54:40.494
Then you get big
manipulators like Donald Trump.

1173
00:54:40.668 --> 00:54:43.018
who can connect
with people emotionally.

1174
00:54:43.192 --> 00:54:46.457
so in many ways. it is
the policies of the Democrats

1175
00:54:46.631 --> 00:54:50.287
that have actually given rise
to this right-wing extremism

1176
00:54:50.461 --> 00:54:52.289
that we see now
under Donald Trump.

1177
00:54:52.463 --> 00:54:55.509
[people shouting]

1178
00:54:56.902 --> 00:54:59.557
[fire crackles]

1179
00:55:04.736 --> 00:55:06.172
[explosion booms]

1180
00:55:06.346 --> 00:55:07.565
- [Woman] Hey. hey.
it's not okay to fight!

1181
00:55:07.739 --> 00:55:09.131
Call the cops!
[explosion booms]

1182
00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:10.655

[siren wails]

1185
00:55:14.615 --> 00:55:16.356
[people shouting]

1186
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.185
- I need to wipe it.
I need to wipe it!

1187
00:55:19.359 --> 00:55:22.231
[explosion booms]

1188
00:55:24.451 --> 00:55:27.367
[people chattering]

1189
00:55:32.764 --> 00:55:35.723
- I was trying to save
somebody who was being attacked

1190
00:55:35.897 --> 00:55:38.291
by the Trump
people and on the ground.

1191
00:55:38.465 --> 00:55:42.991
and as I ran towards it.
I hit a cloud of pepper spray.

1192
00:55:43.165 --> 00:55:44.906
And some
comrades dragged me away.

1193
00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.213
gave me first aid.
and now here I am.

1194
00:55:47.387 --> 00:55:48.780
- They're
throwing bombs at us.

1195
00:55:48.954 --> 00:55:50.738
They're throwing
glass candles at us.

1196
00:55:50.912 --> 00:55:53.306
- [Man] Right.
they're throwing bombs at us.

1197
00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.656
- They were grabbing
some of our guys. the scuffle--

1198
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:56.744
[explosion booms]

1199
00:55:56.918 --> 00:55:58.572
Fuck!

1200
00:55:58.746 --> 00:56:02.097
- I came today prepared
for violence from either side.

1201
00:56:02.271 --> 00:56:04.796
I came with medical bandages.
gauze.

1202
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:06.798
milk to
neutralize pepper spray.

1203
00:56:06.972 --> 00:56:11.759
I've bandaged both Antifa
and Liberty Patriots today.

1204
00:56:11.933 --> 00:56:13.544
- You're allowing
the violence to escalate.

1205
00:56:13.718 --> 00:56:15.763
It's on you guys
for not doing anything

1206
00:56:15.937 --> 00:56:18.113
except sitting
here like cowards.

1207
00:56:18.287 --> 00:56:20.551
[helicopter whirs]

1208
00:56:20.725 --> 00:56:22.335
[siren chirps]

1209
00:56:22.509 --> 00:56:25.860
[sirens wailing]

1210
00:56:26.034 --> 00:56:28.036
- We're the Empathy Tent.

1211
00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:30.474
We offer empathic
listening to people.

1212
00:56:31.518 --> 00:56:33.215
We're trying to get
people to have dialogue.

1213
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:36.871
first to listen to them.
then to bring them into dialogue

1214
00:56:37.045 --> 00:56:38.830
because. really.
the only way forward

1215
00:56:39.004 --> 00:56:42.094
is listening.
empathy. and dialogue.

1216
00:56:42.268 --> 00:56:43.791
And then.
like we say here. it's the basis

1217
00:56:43.965 --> 00:56:46.533
for people getting
together and really addressing

1218
00:56:46.707 --> 00:56:49.101
what their needs are
and really solving problems.

1219
00:56:49.275 --> 00:56:51.669
All the people screaming
and yelling at each other.

1220
00:56:51.843 --> 00:56:54.106
they're actually saying.
"Listen to me. listen to me!"

1221
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.890
And the other side's saying.
"No. listen to me!

1222
00:56:56.064 --> 00:56:57.501
"I wanna be heard!"

1223
00:56:57.675 --> 00:56:59.067
So they're both
really asking for listening.

1224
00:56:59.241 --> 00:57:01.940
so there's a deep down.
just biological need

1225
00:57:02.114 --> 00:57:04.638
that we all have
to be heard and seen.

1226
00:57:04.812 --> 00:57:08.033
and so we're trying to kind
of address that for everyone.

1227
00:57:08.207 --> 00:57:10.949
and also give people the
tools of how they can listen

1228
00:57:11.123 --> 00:57:13.952
to each other because
if you just start dialoguing.

1229
00:57:14.126 --> 00:57:15.823
sometimes
that can break down.

1230
00:57:15.997 --> 00:57:19.218
But if you have some rules.
some processes. some tools.

1231
00:57:19.392 --> 00:57:22.700
a facilitator.
it can kinda help that process.

1232
00:57:22.874 --> 00:57:25.485
People can then learn it.
they internalize it.

1233
00:57:25.659 --> 00:57:27.139
and then they can
become better listeners

1234
00:57:27.313 --> 00:57:30.490
in their families.
in their communities. so we feel

1235
00:57:30.664 --> 00:57:33.885
that there needs to be a
voice out to stand for that.

1236
00:57:34.059 --> 00:57:37.149
[people shouting]

1237
00:57:41.196 --> 00:57:42.850
- [Man] Do we
need to disperse?

1238
00:57:43.024 --> 00:57:46.027
[people chattering]

1239
00:57:51.946 --> 00:57:55.646
[contemplative synth music]

1240
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.519
[electronic beeps]

1241
00:58:00.651 --> 00:58:03.218
[vehicles rumbling]

1242
00:58:03.392 --> 00:58:05.177
- [Man] Build the wall!

1243
00:58:05.351 --> 00:58:09.181
- [Crowd] No Trump.
no KKK. no fascist USA!

1244
00:58:09.355 --> 00:58:11.313
[people chattering]

1245
00:58:11.488 --> 00:58:13.751
- [Man] Go back to Europe!

1246
00:58:13.925 --> 00:58:15.492
- We see
division and conflict

1247
00:58:15.666 --> 00:58:17.058
everywhere
around the country.

1248
00:58:17.232 --> 00:58:20.366
between the Trump side
and the progressive side.

1249
00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.108
so after what we saw
and experienced in Berkeley.

1250
00:58:23.282 --> 00:58:26.154
we decided we needed
to take the Empathy Tent

1251
00:58:26.328 --> 00:58:29.593
to as many political
confrontations as possible.

1252
00:58:29.767 --> 00:58:31.508
So the next
big event we went to

1253
00:58:31.682 --> 00:58:34.380
was the Impeachment
March in Los Angeles.

1254
00:58:34.554 --> 00:58:37.514
[people shouting]

1255
00:58:38.732 --> 00:58:40.604
[people chattering]

1256
00:58:40.778 --> 00:58:43.781
We went and actually
set up an Empathy Tent

1257
00:58:43.955 --> 00:58:47.132
at this rally to
offer listening to two sides

1258
00:58:47.306 --> 00:58:49.569
that were there
and have them dialogue

1259
00:58:49.743 --> 00:58:51.310
with each
other and really share

1260
00:58:51.484 --> 00:58:54.705
how they were feeling
about the impeachment issue

1261
00:58:54.879 --> 00:58:57.403
as well as some
other issues as well.

1262
00:58:57.577 --> 00:59:01.581
So I was really taken
that people were really grateful

1263
00:59:01.755 --> 00:59:04.715
to have this
opportunity to dialogue.

1264
00:59:04.889 --> 00:59:06.586
- We need more
dialogue right now

1265
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:09.197
'cause we're. in some ways.
on the edge of a civil war.

1266
00:59:09.371 --> 00:59:10.808
It could
escalate very easily.

1267
00:59:10.982 --> 00:59:12.200
Somebody could get injured

1268
00:59:12.374 --> 00:59:14.202
and they becomes
martyr to either side.

1269
00:59:14.376 --> 00:59:16.030
I feel what
you're doing here today

1270
00:59:16.204 --> 00:59:18.206
and what we all can do.
what you're doing speaking

1271
00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:20.252
to the other side.
I think that's wonderful.

1272
00:59:20.426 --> 00:59:21.819
There's
definitely a need for that.

1273
00:59:21.993 --> 00:59:23.690
- Would you like to
share what you heard?

1274
00:59:23.864 --> 00:59:26.737
- Again. I wish we had
more opportunities to speak.

1275
00:59:26.911 --> 00:59:28.826
and the young man
I was speaking to said

1276
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.697
that the police
wouldn't let them

1277
00:59:30.871 --> 00:59:33.352
cross the street to come to us.
approach us.

1278
00:59:33.526 --> 00:59:34.919
and I was like.
oh. well. that's sad.

1279
00:59:35.093 --> 00:59:36.660
I can
understand during the march.

1280
00:59:36.834 --> 00:59:38.792
but once we're at the location.
you should be able

1281
00:59:38.966 --> 00:59:41.795
to come over and
kinda dialogue and talk

1282
00:59:41.969 --> 00:59:46.974
because emotions without
thought are dangerous. you know?

1283
00:59:47.801 --> 00:59:50.369
- I guess my greatest fear
is that there's a large division

1284
00:59:50.543 --> 00:59:53.024
within the nation of
fundamental differences

1285
00:59:53.198 --> 00:59:57.898
that people are
really not likely to agree on.

1286
00:59:58.072 --> 01:00:00.597
It's tough because
I have family members

1287
01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:02.337
that disagree with me.

1288
01:00:02.511 --> 01:00:04.775
And this country is
founded on certain principles.

1289
01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:08.256
and a portion of that population
believes it in one way

1290
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:11.085
and another portion
believes it in another way.

1291
01:00:12.347 --> 01:00:14.872
Those sides don't look
like they're getting along.

1292
01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:16.743
and it's just
come to a boiling point.

1293
01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:19.224
and I think this has
been going on for a long time.

1294
01:00:19.398 --> 01:00:21.443
It's just the
Trump presidency

1295
01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.881
has just been
the catalyst for it.

1296
01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:26.623
- Yeah. I definitely agree
with him on also the division--

1297
01:00:26.797 --> 01:00:28.494
- [Alex] Oh.
the division?

1298
01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:30.714
You're also concerned about
the division in the country?

1299
01:00:30.888 --> 01:00:33.542
- It seems like our
only way of dealing with things

1300
01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:35.327
is finger-pointing
and just saying

1301
01:00:35.501 --> 01:00:37.285
that this
specific group of people

1302
01:00:37.459 --> 01:00:39.810
are problems.
and it's on both sides.

1303
01:00:39.984 --> 01:00:42.769
And it's not
getting anywhere.

1304
01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:45.642
- I agree with
plenty of liberal ideas.

1305
01:00:45.816 --> 01:00:48.688
but there are plenty
of more conservative ideas

1306
01:00:48.862 --> 01:00:52.213
that I find more reasonable
and I find more attractive.

1307
01:00:52.387 --> 01:00:56.043
For instance. if I say
I'm very pro Second Amendment.

1308
01:00:56.217 --> 01:00:57.958
then somebody will go.
oh. so then you're

1309
01:00:58.132 --> 01:01:01.179
like a right-wing gun nut.
and I'm like. well. hold up. no.

1310
01:01:01.353 --> 01:01:04.878
I'm very much in favor
of having more open borders.

1311
01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:06.924
of people being able
to come into this country

1312
01:01:07.098 --> 01:01:08.621
and work.
legally. obviously.

1313
01:01:08.795 --> 01:01:09.883
So they go. oh.
well. then you're

1314
01:01:10.057 --> 01:01:11.102
like some
kind of libertarian.

1315
01:01:11.276 --> 01:01:12.712
so you're
never just a person.

1316
01:01:12.886 --> 01:01:14.279
- People aren't
seeing you for who you are.

1317
01:01:14.453 --> 01:01:16.150
and that's like a concern.
to be seen.

1318
01:01:16.324 --> 01:01:17.630
So. okay
- Yeah.

1319
01:01:17.804 --> 01:01:19.023
That's a really
good point you're making.

1320
01:01:19.197 --> 01:01:20.459
This is what I don't like.

1321
01:01:20.633 --> 01:01:21.852
What's wrong with
being a conservative?

1322
01:01:22.026 --> 01:01:24.202
What's wrong with
being a right-wing?

1323
01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:25.899
What is wrong with that?

1324
01:01:26.073 --> 01:01:30.687
But it's okay for people
to be accepted as being liberal.

1325
01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:33.037
as being a Democrat.
as being left.

1326
01:01:33.211 --> 01:01:34.778
See.
this is what I think.

1327
01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:36.388
See. I could tell in your
body language and your voice

1328
01:01:36.562 --> 01:01:38.129
that you had
to defend yourself.

1329
01:01:38.303 --> 01:01:39.783
Oh. no. no. I'm not right.
and see. that is wrong.

1330
01:01:39.957 --> 01:01:41.393
And so what
if you are right?

1331
01:01:41.567 --> 01:01:42.263
Who cares?

1332
01:01:42.437 --> 01:01:43.438
You know what?

1333
01:01:43.612 --> 01:01:45.092
At the end.
who cares?

1334
01:01:45.266 --> 01:01:49.357
- I hope that we.
as a society and as a movement.

1335
01:01:49.531 --> 01:01:51.490
we can still
keep speaking out

1336
01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:54.623
against the things he's
doing against our communities

1337
01:01:54.798 --> 01:01:56.495
and the people that are
getting hurt from his actions.

1338
01:01:56.669 --> 01:02:00.455
from the things he's saying.
and from the people motivated

1339
01:02:00.629 --> 01:02:02.762
by his agenda
and by his rhetoric.

1340
01:02:02.936 --> 01:02:04.024
- So are you
saying there's really

1341
01:02:04.198 --> 01:02:05.809
deeper
problems besides Trump?

1342
01:02:05.983 --> 01:02:08.246
There's like real
deeper issues and problems

1343
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.117
that need to be addressed.
- Exactly.

1344
01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:13.730
- Much of my
impression of our opposition.

1345
01:02:13.904 --> 01:02:16.820
or however we would call it.
has been YouTube videos

1346
01:02:16.994 --> 01:02:19.692
of people throwing.
yelling out propaganda.

1347
01:02:19.866 --> 01:02:21.607
one-liners.
and stuff like that.

1348
01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:25.132
It's not often that I've seen
someone speak out to a length

1349
01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:27.178
like he just did.
so that was pretty good.

1350
01:02:27.352 --> 01:02:29.528
- I think my fundamental
concern with right now.

1351
01:02:29.702 --> 01:02:32.618
with the state of the
country with where it is.

1352
01:02:34.011 --> 01:02:37.666
is that there isn't this
type of dialogue happening.

1353
01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:41.366
is that we are
entering into a society

1354
01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:45.500
where people are
afraid to speak out.

1355
01:02:45.674 --> 01:02:50.723
I think that if people
are siloed. and people only talk

1356
01:02:50.897 --> 01:02:54.727
to people whom they agree
with and whom they already have

1357
01:02:54.901 --> 01:02:56.903
that same sort of
thought process with.

1358
01:02:57.077 --> 01:02:59.253
then we'll
never have improvement

1359
01:02:59.427 --> 01:03:03.431
to make this country
what it really could be.

1360
01:03:03.605 --> 01:03:06.086
- I think what concerns
me the most about our country

1361
01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:11.004
is that I feel
that a large portion

1362
01:03:11.178 --> 01:03:15.313
of the population is making
their decisions based on fear.

1363
01:03:17.054 --> 01:03:20.927
and I feel that that's
motivating people's politics.

1364
01:03:21.101 --> 01:03:25.410
and I don't think it's
the strongest. healthiest.

1365
01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:29.849
or most peace-conducive
place to come from.

1366
01:03:30.023 --> 01:03:32.417
- At this point.
to kinda end the conversation.

1367
01:03:32.591 --> 01:03:34.201
how was the
empathic listening.

1368
01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:36.900
having the person
listen to you before you spoke?

1369
01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:39.380
Did that feel
satisfactory at all?

1370
01:03:39.554 --> 01:03:42.906
Was that helpful in terms
of feeling like you were heard?

1371
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.126
- Yeah. I feel that
Spencer is a good listener.

1372
01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:49.956
even though we totally
have different views on this.

1373
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:54.178
I'm pretty sure we'll never
see eye to eye on this stuff.

1374
01:03:54.352 --> 01:03:58.530
but I still got to
appreciate his ability

1375
01:03:58.704 --> 01:04:02.403
and willingness
to sit and listen

1376
01:04:02.577 --> 01:04:04.841
to me and let
me listen to him.

1377
01:04:05.015 --> 01:04:06.799
[reflective synth music]

1378
01:04:06.973 --> 01:04:10.063
- It was something I found.
when we set up at Berkeley too.

1379
01:04:10.237 --> 01:04:13.327
is going out and offering
to do not just listening

1380
01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:15.895
but feeling that warmth.

1381
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:19.725
that human connection.
really calms people down.

1382
01:04:19.899 --> 01:04:22.597
And I hear a lot.
people say. empathy is

1383
01:04:22.771 --> 01:04:25.513
for your personal relationships.
your family. your friend.

1384
01:04:25.687 --> 01:04:29.474
but politics is really
about greed and selfishness.

1385
01:04:29.648 --> 01:04:32.694
and it doesn't really fit
in there. so don't even bother.

1386
01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.784
But I think the functioning
part of the democracy

1387
01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:38.613
that's working right
now is the empathic part.

1388
01:04:38.787 --> 01:04:41.878
People do talk to each other.
or it starts with empathy

1389
01:04:42.052 --> 01:04:45.055
as the gateway.
and then once you understand

1390
01:04:45.229 --> 01:04:47.927
the needs that people have.
the pain that they have.

1391
01:04:48.101 --> 01:04:53.280
the alienation. then you
can start using logic and reason

1392
01:04:53.454 --> 01:04:56.066
and find connection.
and from that connection.

1393
01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.896
they find
solutions to their problems.

Johan Galtung. he says
peace is resolving conflict

1395
01:05:04.117 --> 01:05:07.294
with empathy.
creativity. and nonviolence.

1396
01:05:07.468 --> 01:05:09.340
and it's a
never-ending task.

1397
01:05:09.514 --> 01:05:10.950
It's like it never ends.

1398
01:05:11.124 --> 01:05:13.213
It's like we're
always having to do it.

1399
01:05:13.387 --> 01:05:15.259
so it's not
like we're gonna solve

1400
01:05:15.433 --> 01:05:18.262
the problem
of this division.

1401
01:05:18.436 --> 01:05:22.614
It's an ongoing problem-solving
that we need to do.

1402
01:05:24.442 --> 01:05:27.967
- [Narrator] In 2016.
more than 250 million people

1403
01:05:28.141 --> 01:05:31.928
were eligible to vote.
and only 55% voted.

1404
01:05:32.102 --> 01:05:34.452
Democracy will die
without participation

1405
01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:36.280
and an open dialogue.

1406
01:05:36.454 --> 01:05:39.587
Join the conversation
now before it's too late.
