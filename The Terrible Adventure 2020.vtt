41
00:02:03.976 --> 00:02:04.809
- [Olivia] Okay.

42
00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:06.290
- I hope you didn't leave a mess.

43
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.780
- But won't Maria get it?

44
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.080
- No. she's not coming.

45
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.410
I had to let her go.

46
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.243
- Why?

47
00:02:11.243 --> 00:02:12.350
- We gotta cut back.

48
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.030
- But she cleans up everything.

49
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.620
- We're gonna be on a very
tight budget for a while.

50
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.090
and. with the divorce. probably
gonna lose the house too.

51
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.923
- What?

52
00:02:20.923 --> 00:02:21.930
- Eh. don't worry about that.

53
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.280
That's for me to worry about.

54
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.990
- I just hate that Mom did this.

55
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.420
That she divorced you

56
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.600
and is always out of town.

57
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.480

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.110

- Hey. where's Jackson?

61
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.486

63
00:02:39.177 --> 00:02:40.990
- Oh. well. that's strange.

64
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.970
He just went live.

in a few minutes.

70
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.400
She's gonna drop off some of my things

so I do want it.

92
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.400
- A spoon collection. really?

93
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.790
What kind of man has a spoon collection?

94
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.271
Get it away from me!

95
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:44.240

100
00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:53.821
What's going on?

101
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:55.010
- And this piece of junk

102
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.420
that your sister gave us?

103
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.530
It's the cheapest piece of crap.

104
00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.363
Hi. honey.

105
00:04:59.363 --> 00:05:00.288

Oh. how lovely.

111
00:05:10.575 --> 00:05:12.610
- Mm.

112
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.512

00:05:14.512 --> 00:05:15.345
(Olivia laughing)

114
00:05:15.345 --> 00:05:17.210
- [Janet] Green is my favorite color.

115
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.333
You know that.

116
00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:21.123
We can use a little red.

117
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.800
- Mom.
- Oh. and here's

118
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.280

Okay?

128
00:05:39.073 --> 00:05:40.900
And tell Jackson to put away that drone

129
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.843
and get there on time for once.

130
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.940
- And by the way. we're
leaving for vacation tomorrow.

131
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.800
So don't screw everything
up like you normally do.

132
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.833

of the kids. as usual.

(ominous music)

137
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.300
- This is agent 62563A.

138
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.900
I want to report a weaponized drone.

139
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.610
- [Woman] Weaponized. Paul?

140
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.606
- It's a toxic drone.
toxic to the environment.

141
00:06:24.606 --> 00:06:26.570
- [Woman] Toxic. Paul?

142
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.380
- It could pollute the ocean.

143
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.950
Not on my watch.

144
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.100
- [Woman] Please issue a warning.

145
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.900
- It's going down. downtown.

146
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.833
- [Woman] Downtown?

147
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.038
- It's a saying.

148
00:06:36.038 --> 00:06:37.330
You know what I mean.

149
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.160
It's either here or downtown.

150
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.653
Over and out.

151
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:46.668
(drone buzzing)

152
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.900
Hey. you can't fly that drone here.

153
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.070
- What drone?

154
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.903
- That drone.

155
00:06:53.903 --> 00:06:55.750
If that drone crushes into the water.

156
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.960
it'll be spilling toxic
chemicals into the water

157
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.770
for over 75 years. long
after we're both dead!

158
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.750
- Speak for yourself.

159
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.110
I've never crashed a drone.

160
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.113
I can fly anything.

161
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.620
- It's kids like you that are
destroying our environment

162
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.090
and our natural resources.

163
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.530
- My dad has the only
resource that we need. money.

164
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.910
- Land the drone.

165
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.833
That's it. I'm confiscating it!

166
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.740
- Good luck.

167
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.573
- You land it!

168
00:07:19.347 --> 00:07:20.879
- [Jackson] I-It's not working.

169
00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:21.712
- [Paul] That's it.

170
00:07:21.712 --> 00:07:23.584
You're going down. downtown.

171
00:07:23.584 --> 00:07:26.334

172
00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:44.144
(upbeat music)

173
00:07:49.643 --> 00:07:51.083
- [Jackson] It works every time.

174
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.110
- Hey. Jackson.

175
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.943
- [Jackson] Hey. Olivia.

176
00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:06.340
- Dad said to stop flying your drone.

177
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.900
Anyway. we gotta get to school.

178
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.050

- All right. you have any experience?

202
00:08:50.216 --> 00:08:51.340
- With?

203
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.318
- Ice cream.

204
00:08:52.318 --> 00:08:55.010
- (laughs) It's ice cream.

205
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.390
- Yes. but you gotta sell it.

206
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.550
Let's say a kid comes up.

207
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.440
he wants only one.

I want you to sell three

209
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.674
Here. sell me this Huncha Muncha.

(light music)

211
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.630
- Hey. want a Huncha Muncha?

212
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.800
Kinda sells itself. don't you think?

213
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.060
- What's your name anyway?

214
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.893
- Juan.

215
00:09:18.893 --> 00:09:20.790
- You you don't look like a Juan.

216
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.740

- Junior.

222
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.310
It was my dad's name.

223
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.530
Hey. is it always this chilly in here?

224
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.470

That's what I'm gonna
name you. Chilly Chilly.

229
00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.213
- Okay.

230
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.140
- I need some help here.

231
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.530
My knees aren't what they used to be.

232
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.720
- Be real fun learning

233
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.980
from an expert ice
cream salesman like you.

234
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.921
- All right. I need you to
go to my office door here.

235
00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:12.950
where it says. it's
written right on there.

in the world. incorporated.

238
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.960
Get those two styrofoam
containers in there

239
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.260
that are marked Huncha Muncha.

240
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.300
Bring 'em on out to the truck.

241
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.060
and I'll show you the route.

242
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.670
- The door that says world's greatest

244
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.513
- Yes. my short catchy name.

245
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.863
- Okay.

246
00:10:33.863 --> 00:10:35.470
You got it. Boss.

247
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:40.470
- Kingdom. phylum. class. order.
family. genus and species.

248
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.433
Can someone give me an
example of a species?

249
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.323
- Wolf.

250
00:10:47.323 --> 00:10:48.156
- Very good.

251
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.160
Of a genus?

252
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.793
Yes.

253
00:10:52.793 --> 00:10:53.955
- Albert Einstein.

254
00:10:53.955 --> 00:10:54.788
(kids giggle)

255
00:10:54.788 --> 00:10:56.883
- Albert Einstein was a genius. yes.

256
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.010
- A mud turtle?

257
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.410
- A mud turtle. very good.

258
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.200
Now. can someone give me an example

259
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.193
of my favorite family?

260
00:11:06.326 --> 00:11:07.817
- Anatidae?

261
00:11:07.817 --> 00:11:10.486
- Anatidae. very good job. Olivia.

Engine has some problems too. you know.

All right. Chilly. this
is one of my best spots.

Those kids are gonna
be here any minute now.

268
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.540
and all they wanna do is
try and win this contest.

270

kazillionaire Billy Bob Branson.

271
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.613
- Who?

272
00:11:34.613 --> 00:11:35.446
- He's the guy that gave me

273
00:11:35.446 --> 00:11:37.640
all this promotional stuff for the truck.

274
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.500
Besides. a white. empty ice cream truck

275
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.800
looks kinda creepy.

276
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.120
- He gave all of this to you?

277
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.700
- He gave all this to me.

278
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.420
including that ice
cream samich on the roof

279
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.160
that I may have. uh. ha ha.
modified it a little bit.

280
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.070
- It's too bad you work for Huncha Muncha.

281
00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:57.943
and you can't win the contest yourself.

282
00:11:57.943 --> 00:11:58.776
- Stop right there.

283
00:11:58.776 --> 00:12:00.170
Let me tell you something. buddy.

284
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.460
I'm my own boss.

285
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.920
I don't work for nobody.

286
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.280
and I could win that money.

287
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.350
And if anybody on my
route pulls the winning

288
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.360
contest ticket. I'm the one that better

289
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.720
get a piece of the action.

290
00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.323
- Well. is the contest worldwide?

291
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.050
- According to this. regions are selected

292
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.270
based on environmental factors.

293
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.400
Florida represents the
Southeastern United States

294

and the Caribbean.

295
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.210
- Don't you have all the ice cream here

296
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.290
with all the contests on it?

297
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.550
How about we open a few

298
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.600
and see if we can find an easy one?

299
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.433
- You know what?

300
00:12:34.433 --> 00:12:35.266
You better wrap 'em back up

301
00:12:35.266 --> 00:12:36.310
so we can sell 'em again.

302
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.980
- [Chilly] You try it. Boss.

303
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.511
You seem smart.

- What's the distance to the sun

306
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.100
divided by the circumference of the moon?

307
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.535
Takes this number and times it

308
00:12:50.535 --> 00:12:54.680
times the square root
of the distance to Mars.

309
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.743
And then. uh. oh. man!

310
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.560
- Hey. I think I found one I can solve.

311
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.569
- Wait.

312
00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:06.453
Type it in. type it in!

is. Scrooge McMoneygills.

Looky. looky here.

316
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.600
I got a hunch. Boss.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.680
I have founded. built and sold off

321
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.640
more companies than I can count.

322
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.733
But you never forget your first.

323
00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:39.660
Huncha Muncha ice cream.

324
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.720
My company has factories
all around the world.

325
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.100
and they were made all the more profitable

326
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.840
thanks to some extremely lax
environmental regulations.

327
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.170
Then. in 2014. a category
five hurricane swept

328
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.330
across one of my private islands.

329
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.020
My house was smashed to smithereens.

330
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.750
It was a complete loss.
due in part to the fact

331
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.600
that there is no secondary
market for smithereens.

332
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.250
Now. I studied this event.

333
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.940
and I discovered that extreme
weather events like this

334
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.910
are on the rise around the globe.

335
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.570
And they're caused. in part.

336
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.653
by the type of pollution that
factories like mine emit.

337
00:14:18.532 --> 00:14:21.630
Now. I rebuilt that house
better than ever before.

338
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.050
And in a similar manner.

339
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.320
I want to use my business acumen

340
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.160
to rebuild our relationship
with the planet.

341
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.980
so that we can live in greater harmony

342
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.530
with nature than ever before.

343
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.950
And that's where you come in.

344
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.710
You see. I collaborated

345
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.170
with the top scientists.
expert psychologists

346
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.800
and the very best middle
school science teachers

347
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.260
to design a contest that would unearth

348
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.450
the smartest people in the world.

349
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.660
I call them Planet Puzzlers.

350
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.010
They shall examine questions

351
00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:56.010
such as global warming. war.
poverty and so much more.

352
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.510
This contest will be rolled out in regions

353
00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.124
around the world based on
specific climate change factors

354
00:15:02.124 --> 00:15:04.640
and where my products are sold.

355
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.950
This will be the most fun.

356
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.330
the most challenging contest
the world has ever seen.

357
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.980
fun and challenging as defined

358
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.930

conditions of the contest.

- Ah man. battery's almost dead.

362
00:15:24.885 --> 00:15:26.911
We got a mouse problem.

363
00:15:26.911 --> 00:15:27.744
(mice squeaking)

364
00:15:27.744 --> 00:15:31.870
- Action. not inaction was
the lesson they were taught.

365
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.137
Okay. kids. your assignment is to reread

366
00:15:35.137 --> 00:15:36.860
"Should. Could and Would."

about entrepreneurship.

369
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.680
Now. over the summer. I hope you come back

370
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.230
and have a story about how you took action

371
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.983
to solve a problem either big or small.

372
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.193
(school bell rings)

373
00:15:50.193 --> 00:15:51.511
Okay. kids. have a great summer.

374
00:15:51.511 --> 00:15:54.121
(kids cheering)

375
00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:56.133
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. y'all.

376
00:15:56.133 --> 00:15:58.421
- [Girl] Let's go get ice cream.

this is your principal
Mr. Hucklebuckfinsky.

380
00:16:04.601 --> 00:16:07.029
I just want to wish you and your family

381
00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:09.077
a safe and wonderful-

382
00:16:09.077 --> 00:16:09.910
- Hurry.

383
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.650
The kids are comin'.

384
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.640
- [Olivia] Look. a dollar.

385
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.190
- Well. if we only had 499.999 more.

386
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.380
we could buy a house here in Florida.

387
00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.340
- A house costs half a million dollars?

388
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.310
- Pretty much.

389
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.470
- At least we now have enough

390
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:24.930
to buy us each some ice cream.

391
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:25.935
- We do?

392
00:16:25.935 --> 00:16:26.768
- [Olivia] Yeah.

393
00:16:26.768 --> 00:16:28.135
I didn't spend my lunch money.

394
00:16:28.135 --> 00:16:30.050
- Huncha Muncha. please.

395
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.790
- Hey. Boss. check this out.

396
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.600
You want three?

397
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.870
Sure is a lot of you.

398
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.110
Please pull around to the second window.

399
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.435

402
00:16:44.694 --> 00:16:46.330
- Here you go. kid.

403
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.410
- W-w-w-w-wait!

404
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.020
We haven't checked that one yet. Chilly.

405
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.060
- Ah. don't worry about it.

406
00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.110
It's like a one in a million chance.

407
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.890
Even adults can't solve it.

408
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:02.360
There's no way a dumb little girl will.

409
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.160
Go ahead. little girl.

410
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.093
Show my boss you're a loser!

411
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:09.803
Stupid.

412
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.463
- Okay.

413
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.110
So important are these three.

414
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:19.000
the land. air and sea to all
of life including humanity.

415
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.500
Can you name the family
that lives on all three?

416
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.860
To make the planet better.

417
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.850
what's a family that has eight letters?

418
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:25.779
Oh. that's easy.

419
00:17:25.779 --> 00:17:27.375
Anatidae.

420
00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:28.246
- What?

421
00:17:28.246 --> 00:17:29.570
- Anatidae?

422
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.140
- Anatidae? What?

423
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.970
- Auntie Mandy's my favorite auntie.

424
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:37.090
- It's a scientific family

425
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.980
in the classification of species.

426

My teacher loves birds.

427
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.570
and some birds live on land. air and sea.

428
00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:43.760
It's one of the greatest families

429
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.700
because it lives in all three.

430
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.670
land. air and sea.

431
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.013
- Quick. type it in. type it in!

432
00:17:54.278 --> 00:17:56.228
- [Chilly] How do you spell that. Boss?

433
00:17:59.377 --> 00:18:00.255
- [Olivia] I won.

434
00:18:00.255 --> 00:18:03.249
Oh my golly gee whiz leaner. I won.

435
00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.990
- [Kids] We won!

436
00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.823
- [Chilly] Wha. wha.

437
00:18:06.823 --> 00:18:08.075
Gimme that back!

438
00:18:08.075 --> 00:18:09.161
- [Olivia] No. no!

439
00:18:09.161 --> 00:18:09.994
- Now. get outta here. kids!

440
00:18:09.994 --> 00:18:11.313
Scram!

441
00:18:11.313 --> 00:18:13.896

443

444
00:18:19.227 --> 00:18:21.770
Get back you little thief!

445
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:22.611
Get back!

calling for Mr. Brad Johnson.

- Well. yeah. this is he.

453
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.123

yeah. you're gonna get

454
00:18:41.123 --> 00:18:42.790
foreclosed on.
- You just called.

455
00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.700
- Yeah. foreclosure.
- Hi. Dad.

456
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.340
- Yeah. you're getting
- Foreclosure?

457
00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.680
No.
- Foreclosed on.

458
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.290
- Just a sec. kids.
- You are a loser.

459
00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.123
Loser.

about the contest?

461

- [Brad] In the last hour.

463
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.110
- What are we gonna do?

464
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.943
- About what?

465
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.420
- Did you hear Dad?

466
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.440
He's behind on bills.

467
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.890
He can't pay the mortgage.

468
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.240
- Mortgage?

469
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.610
- It's like a house payment.

470
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.360
We're not gonna be able
to live here anymore.

471
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.890
- Oh yeah. he did mention
that this morning.

472
00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.190
but I thought we had some. you know. time.

473
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.593
- Foreclosure. we're
going to lose the house.

It's a classic children's book

478
00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.580
about three gnomes who
had a beat up old house.

479
00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.980
- You're already reading it?

480
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.847
You just got home from school.

481
00:19:36.847 --> 00:19:39.190
- "Should Could and Would"
had a tiny little spot

482
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.930
found at the top of a large sunny rock.

483
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.910
a simple shanty house
that didn't have a lock.

484
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.020
a healthy. happy home it surely was not.

485
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.510
Action. not inaction was
the lesson they were taught.

486
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.030
- Man. what are we gonna do?

487
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.770
I feel so helpless yet hungry.

488
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.130
- And to make things worse.

489
00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.910
I have homework to do.

490
00:19:58.910 --> 00:19:59.743
- Burn it.

491
00:19:59.743 --> 00:20:01.490
- I can't burn my homework!

492
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:02.670
I'll flunk.

493
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.880
- It's elementary school. who cares?

494
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.540
- Action. not inaction was
the lesson they were taught.

495
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.010
- Action. not inaction?

496
00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:10.630
- Are you thinking that I'm thinking?

497
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:11.880
- Pizza. great idea!

498
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.713
I'll order.

499
00:20:12.713 --> 00:20:15.382
- No. action. not inaction.

500
00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.250
We have to get my ice cream wrapper back.

501
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.067
It's mine. I won it.

502
00:20:19.067 --> 00:20:20.300
and we need to get it back

503
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.890
from those creepy ice cream men.

504
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.400
- We need a plan and a pizza.

505
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.570
- Oh my golly gee whiz leaner!

506
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.410
I hear 'em. those stinkin' ice cream men.

507
00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.206
Sounds like they're pretty close.

You think there's any way to
get our winning wrapper back?

510
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.220
Think we could catch 'em?

511
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.640
- For what?

512
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.700
- To get my winning wrapper back.

513
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.820
- Not on foot.

514
00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.560
- What about on our bikes?

515
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.844
- We don't know where they are.

516
00:20:48.844 --> 00:20:50.750
and. even if we did.
they could just take off.

517
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.650
- Good point.

518
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.323
They are in a truck.

519
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.440
- I have an idea.

520
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.166

529
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.210

cover letter and resume.

they're about to register it.

00:22:08.319 --> 00:22:09.235
(walkie talkie beeps)

545
00:22:09.235 --> 00:22:11.093
Hey. that's not your ticket!

546
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.340
Give it back. you creeps!

547
00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.219
You won't get away with this.
- What?

548
00:22:15.219 --> 00:22:16.640
What the?

549
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.090
Hey. Boss!

550
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.623
There's a helicopter lookin' at me.

551
00:22:20.623 --> 00:22:22.360
- Give us back our winning ticket.

552
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.193
I'm warning you.

553
00:22:23.193 --> 00:22:25.660
- Get outta here!

554
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.790
- [Jackson] You got to the count of three.

555
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:28.623
One.

556
00:22:28.623 --> 00:22:31.530
- I almost got it. Boss.
- Two. three.

557
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.180
- What about your drone?

558
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.013
- It's on warranty.

559
00:22:34.013 --> 00:22:34.890
It doesn't matter.

560
00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.190
Either way. we have to go.

561
00:22:38.429 --> 00:22:39.309
(sneaky music)

562
00:22:39.309 --> 00:22:40.142
- Bye. Dad.

563
00:22:40.142 --> 00:22:41.480
- Where are you guys going?

564
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.570
- To the library for...

565
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.400
- A report about taking action.

566
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.640
- Yeah. action. not inaction

567
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.710
was the lesson they were taught.

568
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:48.543
- Homework?

569
00:22:48.543 --> 00:22:49.440
But it's summer.

570
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.273
- I'm helping her too.

571
00:22:50.273 --> 00:22:51.850
- Do you guys want a ride?

572
00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:52.683
- We're good.

573
00:22:52.683 --> 00:22:53.900
- [Olivia] I'm gonna go get my bag.

574
00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:54.970
- Okay.

575
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.020
Wait. get the smoke bombs.

576
00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:57.853
- Boss!

577
00:22:57.853 --> 00:22:59.350
I got it. Boss!

578
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.680
Says somethin' about town of clues.

579
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.603
high in the sky.

580
00:23:05.818 --> 00:23:07.968
Oh man. it went out again.

581
00:23:07.968 --> 00:23:10.889
(dramatic music)

582
00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:13.093
Boss. we got a problem.

583
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.327
All right. Boss. we got it under control.

584
00:23:16.327 --> 00:23:17.433
- Ah. my truck.

585
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.055
My truck. my truck.

586
00:23:20.055 --> 00:23:21.972
- It's just smoke bomb.

587
00:23:25.062 --> 00:23:27.979
(victorious music)

588
00:23:31.532 --> 00:23:32.883
(lips blowing)

589
00:23:32.883 --> 00:23:33.716
(Boss squeaking)

590
00:23:33.716 --> 00:23:35.270
You happy now. Boss?

591
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:36.220
- Yes. yes.

592
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.790
- You saved your truck?

593
00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:38.980
- It's my truck.

594
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.051
I worked very hard for this truck. buddy.

595
00:23:41.051 --> 00:23:43.634
(sneaky music)

596
00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.580
- [Jackson] The password's on the back.

597
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.143
Change the password so
they can't log in again.

598
00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:51.623
- Got it.

599
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.313
Let's see.

600
00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.135
I'll change it to action not inaction.

601
00:23:58.135 --> 00:23:58.968
We're in!

602
00:24:02.115 --> 00:24:04.865
(exciting music)

603
00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.880
- Well. firstly. if you are watching this.

604
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.100
congratulations. I am very impressed.

605
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.940
You have used your intelligence.

606
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.900
imagination and creativity to successfully

607
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.370
solve the first puzzle.

608
00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.329
All expenses will be reimbursed only

609
00:24:23.329 --> 00:24:24.830
for the contest winners.

610
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.420
We can't afford to fly everyone

611
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.350
all over the world looking for clues.

612
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.820
However. if you win. you win big!

613
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.720
So good luck and Godspeed.

614
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.560
It's not on the land or the sea.

615
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.270
but we can't breathe if you
don't care about our air.

616
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.380
What you must do in the town of clues

617
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.700
is to get high in the sky that is blue.

618
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.010
using the fewest greenhouse

619
00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.027
- Town of clues?
- gas emissions

620
00:24:45.027 --> 00:24:46.190
is your mission.

621
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.480
Find the molecule with many warnings.

622
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.190
It's directly linked to the calamity

623
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.000
known as global warming.

624
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.730
If your spirit is
unbroken within the clue.

625
00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.444
you will discover the token.

626
00:24:56.444 --> 00:24:59.194
(exciting music)

627
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.110
- Carbon emissions?

628
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.943
Town of clues?

629
00:25:03.943 --> 00:25:05.264
Like a clue town.

630
00:25:05.264 --> 00:25:06.097
(suspenseful music)

631
00:25:06.097 --> 00:25:09.520
Let's see. clue town. clues town.

632
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.353
Got it.

633
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.410
There's a town called Clewiston.

634
00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.010
Hmm.

635
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:16.160
Ooh. we can take a bus.

636
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.660
There's one leaving soon.

637
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.320
Glad I've been saving my allowance.

638
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.210
- What are we gonna tell Dad?

639
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.210
- Maybe we can say

640
00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.180
that we're going to Mom.

641
00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.000
- But she's on vacation.

642
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.050
Maybe you can say that
she changed her mind.

643
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.287
- Yeah. because her
idiot boyfriend is sick

644
00:25:32.287 --> 00:25:33.943
and they had to come home early.

645
00:25:34.871 --> 00:25:35.704
- I can do this.

646
00:25:35.704 --> 00:25:36.770
I just need Dad's phone for a bit.

647
00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.340
- Okay.

648
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.590
- [Brad] I do consider
myself to be a person

649
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.580
of good moral character.

650
00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.960
Why are you asking me this?

651
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.793
That doesn't seem-

652
00:25:44.793 --> 00:25:45.690
- [Jackson] Hey. Dad.

653
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:47.390
- Wait. just give me a minute. okay?

654
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:48.550
- Okay.
- What?

655
00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.103
Listen. I.

656
00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:51.963
Okay.

657
00:25:51.963 --> 00:25:52.860
I just need some time.

658
00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.260
We're gonna move.

659
00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.410
I'm going through a divorce.

660
00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.640
and my credit is shot. as you know.

661
00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.770
I just. and my wife.

662
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:04.770
my ex-wife is getting back
to me on some things I.

663
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.363
What's uh.

664
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.140
Jackson. did you need something?

665
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.120
- Huh?

666
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:12.953
No. no. no. no. no.

667
00:26:12.953 --> 00:26:13.786
I'm good. I'm good.

668
00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.580
Mom. you're not going on vacation?

669
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.020
You're picking us up in an hour or two?

670
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:22.853
All right.

671
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:24.960
- Wait. what?

672
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.660
Let me talk to her.
- Well. she had to go.

673
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.230
- Oh. so she's not going on vacation?

674
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:30.580
- No. her boyfriend's sick.

675
00:26:31.584 --> 00:26:32.544
- Oh.
(phone buzzing)

676
00:26:32.544 --> 00:26:35.600
I just got a text from her.

677
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.460
Well. that works out.

678
00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.520
I have a job interview. so. all right.

679
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.960
Man. that ice cream truck
(Jackson gasps)

680
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.439
guy is persistent.

681
00:26:42.439 --> 00:26:43.272
("The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin)

682
00:26:43.272 --> 00:26:44.217
Do you want some?

683
00:26:44.217 --> 00:26:45.260
- Sure.

684
00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.260
- All right.

685
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.620
- Olivia. ice cream.

686
00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.453
- [Olivia] Oh no.

687
00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.000
- Hey. how's it going?

688
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.110
Uh. well. two Huncha Munchas. I guess.

689
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.360
- How about three?

690
00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.026
- No. two.

691
00:27:01.026 --> 00:27:01.859
- That'll be $4.

692
00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:04.610
- Good afternoon. sir.
- How you doin'?

693
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:05.510
- Is that your house?

694
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.590
- Yeah. this is it.

695
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.480
- I noticed a couple of children

696
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.940
there in the window.

697
00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.420
Are those your kids?

698
00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.510
- Yeah. yeah. those are my kids.

699
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.190
Gonna be on their own for a little while

700
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.260
this afternoon. so I figure

701
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.070
I better buy some cooperation.

702
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.540
- They're gonna be home alone you said?

703
00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.732
- Yeah. I got a job
interview. so. you know.

704
00:27:23.732 --> 00:27:25.382
All right.
- That'll be $4.

705
00:27:25.382 --> 00:27:26.720
- Nobody else in the house?
- Nope.

706
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.100
- Two frozen babysitters.
- There you go.

707
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.933
Now we're talkin'.

708
00:27:29.933 --> 00:27:31.940
- Uh. we'll circle around a few times

709
00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.430
to keep an eye on them if you like. sir.

710
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:34.463
If that'd make
- That's really

711
00:27:34.463 --> 00:27:35.930
- you feel more comfortable?

712
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.500
Is that all right?
- not necessary.

713
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.727
- Oh. we're in the neighborhood anyway.

714
00:27:38.727 --> 00:27:39.600
- No.
- It's easy.

715
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.900
- Whatever. you guys.
- Hey. don't worry

716
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.000
about a thing.
- Sure.

717
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.270
- Well. please. have a good day.

718
00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:45.103
- Okay. all right.
- Good luck

719
00:27:45.103 --> 00:27:45.936
with the job interview.
- Okay.

720
00:27:45.936 --> 00:27:47.540
- And take your time.
- That's just fine.

721
00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:48.960
- Don't worry.
- Freaks.

722
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.220
- Don't rush.

723
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.233
Have a nice day.

724
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.093
Arrivederci!

725
00:27:55.795 --> 00:27:57.126
(light music)

726
00:27:57.126 --> 00:27:57.959
- Hi. Dad.

727
00:27:57.959 --> 00:27:59.422
- What are you guys doing?

728
00:27:59.422 --> 00:28:01.781
- Um. well.
- Uh. uh. it's our game.

729
00:28:01.781 --> 00:28:03.290
- Okay.

730
00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.740
I've got my job interview.
- Okay.

731
00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.400
- And your mom's coming soon. right?

732
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.460
- Yeah.
- Um hmm.

733
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.186
- Okay. so I'll see you later.

734
00:28:10.186 --> 00:28:11.019
- You better hurry.

735
00:28:11.019 --> 00:28:12.140
You don't want to be late.

736
00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.511
- You be good.

737
00:28:13.511 --> 00:28:14.717
- Um hmm. all right.
- Okay.

738
00:28:14.717 --> 00:28:15.550
All right.

739
00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.410
- What are we gonna do?

740
00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:21.500
- I have an idea.

741
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.576
Follow me.

(scheming music)

743
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.490
- What are we gonna do?

744
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.767
- I have an idea that's gonna shock 'em.

745
00:28:51.457 --> 00:28:53.355

746
00:28:53.355 --> 00:28:55.272

Yah!

748
00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:01.520
- Hey.

749
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.336
- What's up. Boss?

750
00:29:03.336 --> 00:29:04.190
- See that door?

751
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:05.570
- Right there behind that tree?

752
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.700
- We need to get behind that door

753
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.260
to get those kids that have the clue.

754
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.340
Understand?
- What clue?

755
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.500
- From the Huncha Muncha
wrapper. for the treasure.

756
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.420
- What treasure?

757
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.213
- For the treasure we've
been looking for all day!

758

759

- How many times I need to tell you?

- Oh. all right.

761
00:29:24.363 --> 00:29:25.700
- [Olivia] Are you ready to kill 'em?

762
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.800
- [Jackson] It's good.

763
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.230
- [Chilly] Are you sure he's gone?

764
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.590
- [Boss] He's gone.

765
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.450
All right. now. Chilly.
- Yeah?

766
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:34.700
- [Boss] Kick that door open.

767
00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.600
So we can get in there
and get that wrapper.

768
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.593
- Yah!
- Kick it!

769
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.905
Do it again.
- Chop suey!

770
00:29:40.905 --> 00:29:42.465
- Again.
- Chop suey!

- [Boss] He just got electrocuted.

779
00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:04.059
He's all fried up.

00:30:10.914 --> 00:30:11.750
Do you have those pliers?

783
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.150
- Yeah.
- I have an idea.

784
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:13.983

00:30:13.983 --> 00:30:15.119
Look. there are the kids.

- There. (blubbering)

787
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.733
- Go get 'em.

788
00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:18.717
Go get 'em. Chilly.

Chilly. we got a flat tire now!

792

- Of course we do.
- We gotta get

793
00:30:25.513 --> 00:30:26.970
to the shop now.

right with us. Boss.

- Oh. man.

796
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.370
Here. try cleaning yourself up.

797
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:33.253
You're a mess.

Ay yi yi.

799
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.970
- [Chilly] Let's go fix this flat.

800
00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.360
- [Boss] We gotta figure
out where the clue is.

801
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.350
- [Chilly] There's a
great shop up the road

How are we going to find a molecule?

Town of clues.

high in the sky there. man.

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:11.190
with a rope. and they drag you behind.

you can steer a shopping cart

you can fly a hang glider.

cart's on the ground.

the shopping cart.

875

you knocked over the tomato can display.

- [Olivia] Why not?

879
00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:47.280
- [Jackson] Because there's
no tomato can displays

in the sky.

If there's no mountains to jump off of?

us up by plane or truck.

Y'all don't go nowhere. you hear?

906
00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.277
Get her done.

907
00:34:33.277 --> 00:34:34.110
(frantic music)

908
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:35.360
- [Jackson] Follow me. I have an idea.

909
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.110
- [Olivia] Are you sure about this?

910
00:34:38.533 --> 00:34:39.411
(ice cream truck backfires)

911
00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:40.661
- [Chilly] Yah!

912
00:34:44.391 --> 00:34:47.058
(comical music)

913
00:34:49.323 --> 00:34:51.906
(Boss farting)

914
00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:58.375
(toilet flushes)

915
00:34:58.375 --> 00:35:00.620
- Hey. how you doin'. man?
- Hey.

916
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.280
- How can I help you?

917
00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.690
- Did you see a couple of
kids come through here?

918
00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:04.850
- Yeah. I did.

919
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:06.533
I think they went up that way.

920
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.150
- You gotta get me up into the sky.

921
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.017
- You're not gettin' high
in the sky today. sir.

922
00:35:11.017 --> 00:35:13.640
- Are you tryin' to say I'm too tall?

923
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.730
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

924
00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:16.940
- Would you rather be kidnapped?

925
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.250
- [Olivia] Point taken.

926
00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.310
- Yeah. you're too tall.

927
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:21.260
That's it. yeah.

928
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.120
- You believe this guy?

929
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.880
He's tryin' to tell me
I'm too tall to fly?

930
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.713
- Crazy.

931
00:35:24.713 --> 00:35:25.730
You're not even tall!

932
00:35:26.682 --> 00:35:27.515
- Well. get in the truck.

933
00:35:27.515 --> 00:35:28.350
We gotta go get 'em.

934
00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.559
Let's go get 'em.

935
00:35:29.559 --> 00:35:32.309
(dramatic music)

936
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.890
- Are you sure you can fly this?

937
00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:39.993
- I can fly anything.

938
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.050
Oh. snap. the ice cream men.

939
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:43.883
We gotta go.

940
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.890
- [Olivia] So how does this work?

941
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:48.370
- [Jackson] That rope is
attached to the plane.

942
00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:49.330
It's gonna pull us into the air.

943
00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.278
where. hopefully. we'll find the clue.

944
00:35:51.278 --> 00:35:54.361
- Hey. kids. you can't go without me.

945
00:36:00.375 --> 00:36:01.958
- Full speed ahead!

946
00:36:03.776 --> 00:36:05.552
- Dagnabbit. not again.

947
00:36:05.552 --> 00:36:09.457
- Oh my gosh. we're not gonna make it!

948
00:36:09.457 --> 00:36:11.457
- [Jackson] Yes. we are!

949
00:36:15.281 --> 00:36:17.997
- [Chilly] Hey. you missed 'em.

950
00:36:17.997 --> 00:36:18.830
- Oh.

951
00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:23.095
- Wow. those kids can actually fly.

952
00:36:23.095 --> 00:36:25.970
(adventurous music)

953
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:27.510
- [Olivia] This is awesome.

954
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.080
We're actually flying.

955
00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.180
How are we going to find a
molecule with many warnings

956
00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.520
linked to global warming?

957
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:40.153
- Wait. that looks like.
like. carbon dioxide?

958
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.600
- [Boss] The clue must
be up there somewhere.

959
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.753
You've gotta tow me up.

960
00:36:46.244 --> 00:36:48.080
- [Chilly] You sure about this?

961
00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.988
- [Boss] Don't question me. I'm the boss!

962
00:36:49.988 --> 00:36:51.238
- [Chilly] Yah!

963
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.108
- All right. get the rope.

964
00:36:54.108 --> 00:36:55.320
All right. Chilly. we're
gonna use the truck

965
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.772
to tow me up in the sky.

966
00:36:56.772 --> 00:37:00.360
(suspenseful music)

967
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.333
Hey. hurry up!

968
00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.390
We're gonna fly high in the sky.

969
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:07.150
I'm gonna take off quicker than a wrapper

970
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:08.790
on a Huncha Muncha samich.

971
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.320
I'm gonna be like the sorbet airways.

972
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.023
- You're gonna fly high.

973
00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.330
All set. captain.

974
00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.640
Let's fly!

975
00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.853
He's so gonna die.

976
00:37:23.135 --> 00:37:25.096
- Kick it.

977
00:37:25.096 --> 00:37:25.929
Go.

978
00:37:32.213 --> 00:37:33.070
Oh!

979
00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.740
- [Jackson] Is that carbon dioxide?

980
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.770
That's it!

981
00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:38.100
Let's disconnect and land this thing.

982
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.100
(adventurous music)

983
00:37:54.144 --> 00:37:55.587
- Good landing.

984
00:37:55.587 --> 00:37:56.420
- [Boss] Hit it!

985
00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:57.837
- He thinks he's gonna fly.

986
00:37:57.837 --> 00:37:59.010
- Chilly. kick it!

987
00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.633
- [Chilly] He's probably gonna die!

988
00:38:02.665 --> 00:38:04.300
- Chilly. get me up in the air.

989
00:38:06.286 --> 00:38:08.473
Oh. shoot. the rope broke.

990
00:38:08.473 --> 00:38:09.538
Get the kids!

991
00:38:09.538 --> 00:38:12.310
- (laughing) Tough break. Boss!

992
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.218
I'm gonna get the kids.

993
00:38:14.218 --> 00:38:16.599
(ice cream truck backfiring)

994
00:38:16.599 --> 00:38:19.349
(dramatic music)

995
00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:26.218
(light music)

996
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:37.360
- Charcoal. carbon.

997
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.790
- Tires. muffler. these are all car parts.

998
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:42.923
- Catalytic converter?

999
00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.423
Carbon dioxide.

1000
00:38:49.882 --> 00:38:51.482
- [Chilly] Huncha Muncha!

1001
00:38:51.482 --> 00:38:54.232
(dramatic music)

1002
00:39:00.285 --> 00:39:01.179
- Wow.
- Ooh.

1003
00:39:01.179 --> 00:39:03.929
(wondrous music)

1004
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.800
- [Jackson] A Planet
Puzzler is part of a unique

1005
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.639
group of people who solves
the world's greatest problems?

1006
00:39:09.639 --> 00:39:11.889
- [Olivia] Enter it. quick.

1007
00:39:20.913 --> 00:39:23.663
(exciting music)

1008
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.330
- This next mystery's key lies

1009
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.810
in the theater of the sea.

1010
00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:34.900
where there's a clash between
water. life and trash.

1011
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.930
Don't wait until later.

1012
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.770
there could be alligators.

1013
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:40.280
You'll need a skiff to
look under the cliff.

1014
00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.520
But once you reach the end of the beach.

1015
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.496
listen and you'll hear
the cry of the Lorelei.

1016
00:39:45.496 --> 00:39:48.246
(exciting music)

1017
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.623
- [Jackson] Let's get out of here.

1018
00:39:56.392 --> 00:39:59.879
(frantic music)

1019
00:39:59.879 --> 00:40:01.712
Ice cream men!
- Oh no.

1020
00:40:05.093 --> 00:40:08.843
(ice cream truck backfiring)

1021
00:40:11.574 --> 00:40:13.491
- [Jackson] Keep it up.

1022
00:40:14.521 --> 00:40:16.130
- [Chilly] Hee yah!

1023
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:17.727
Direct hit.

1024
00:40:17.727 --> 00:40:18.560
- I got you. Jackson.

1025
00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.739
- Peekaboo!
- Ugh. ugh.

1026
00:40:19.739 --> 00:40:20.788
- Got you.

1027
00:40:20.788 --> 00:40:21.920
- [Olivia] Ha. take that!

1028
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.608
Ice cream to the face!

1029
00:40:23.608 --> 00:40:24.441
(Chilly grunting)

1030
00:40:24.441 --> 00:40:25.593
Come on. start. start start.

1031
00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.557
- [Boss] Oh. hey. hey. what are you doin'?

1032
00:40:31.557 --> 00:40:32.390
- No. no.
- Come here. you little brat.

1033
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:33.223
- [Olivia] Let go of me.

1034
00:40:33.223 --> 00:40:35.137
Come on. no. let go of me.
- I got you now.

1035
00:40:35.137 --> 00:40:36.200
- [Olivia] No. no.

1036
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.151
- Stop!
- Let go of me!

1037
00:40:38.151 --> 00:40:39.653
Let go!
- Let me down.

1038
00:40:39.653 --> 00:40:41.198
- Get in there.
- Let me down!

1039
00:40:41.198 --> 00:40:44.031
(kids struggling)

1040
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:48.520
- Hey. I know you know where the clue is!

1041
00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.330
Now cough it up!

1042
00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:51.600
- We don't know anything.

1043
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.080
- It's in the Keys.

1044
00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.250
- Hear that. Boss?

1045
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.050
We're goin' to the Keys.

1046
00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.250
- What are you doing?

1047
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.670
- Getting us a ride to the Keys.

1048
00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.010
- Oh. smart.

1049
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:02.350
- Now let's get rid of these little kids!

1050
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:04.620
- You'll never solve
the riddle on your own.

1051
00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:05.500
- Ooh. burn.

1052
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.350
- We need them to solve the clue.

1053
00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:10.740
You know. so we can find the
next token down in the Keys.

1054
00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.800
(cell phone ringing)
- Check. Boss.

1055
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.380
- Answer the phone!

1056
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.213
- [Chilly] Untie 'em?

1057
00:41:15.213 --> 00:41:16.823
- Or the dad's gonna call the cops!

1058
00:41:17.983 --> 00:41:19.633
- You answer that phone.

1059
00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.980
Where is it?

1060
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.897
- [Olivia] It's my dad!

1061
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.280
- [Brad] Hey. Olivia.

1062
00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.753
- Uh. hi. Dad.

1063
00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:31.600
- I finally got back
from my job interview.

1064
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.713
It took forever.

1065
00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.211
But I wanted to tell you guys good night.

1066
00:41:36.211 --> 00:41:37.786
(tinny ice cream truck music)

1067
00:41:37.786 --> 00:41:39.108
What is that music?

1068
00:41:39.108 --> 00:41:40.410
- [Olivia] What music?

1069
00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.340
- Is everything okay?

1070
00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.190
- [Olivia] We're having fun.

1071
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.260
and you don't need to worry about us.

1072
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.620
- You are with your mother. right?

1073
00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.250
- Mom totally gave us permission

1074
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.790
to do this contest.

1075
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:51.623
- Contest?

1076
00:41:51.623 --> 00:41:53.620
- We're. you know. following our hunch.

1077
00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.350
- Following your hunch?

1078
00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:56.410
I don't.

1079
00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:58.400
- You know. like the ice cream?

1080
00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.960
- What-
- Dad. we're totally fine.

1081
00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.390
Don't worry about us.

1082
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:02.440
- Is Jackson with you?

1083
00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.420
Let me talk to him.

1084
00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.410
- Jackson's just kind of
tied up at the moment.

1085
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:07.820
You know. no big deal.

1086
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.299
Gotta go. Dad. bye!

1087
00:42:09.299 --> 00:42:11.516
(worried music)

1088
00:42:11.516 --> 00:42:12.349
- What?

1089
00:42:15.643 --> 00:42:16.708
(tropical music)

1090
00:42:16.708 --> 00:42:17.541
(phone buzzing)

1091
00:42:17.541 --> 00:42:18.400
- Ugh!

1092
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.640
Who's calling me in Fiji?

1093
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.913
Oh. it's the schmuck!

1094
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:24.920
What?

1095
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.410
- You gave the kids
permission to do some contest?

1096
00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:30.590
- Ugh. why would I be talking to the kids?

1097
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:32.930
I'm sitting on a beach in Fiji right now.

1098
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:34.283
- You are in Fiji?

1099
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:38.010
At the beach. in the middle of the night?

1100
00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:41.083
- It's daytime here. you twit.

1101
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.600
- Triple whiskey on the rocks.

1102
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.630
- Thank you.

1103
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:47.224
- Fiji weegee. the spirit of spirits.

1104
00:42:47.224 --> 00:42:48.360
- Thank you.

1105
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.870
- [Waiter] That'll be $57.25.

1106
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:51.254
- Go ahead and put
- No. the kids said

1107
00:42:51.254 --> 00:42:52.420
- it on my room.
- that you stayed home

1108
00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.540
because your stupid boyfriend was sick.

1109
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.174
- They tricked you again.

1110
00:42:56.174 --> 00:42:58.007
You're so manipulable.

1111
00:42:58.878 --> 00:43:00.530
- Manipulable.

1112
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:01.650
- Just find them!

1113
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:02.560
- How am I supposed to-

1114
00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.270
- Hire a detective!

1115
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:06.420
- I'll find one first
thing in the morning.

1116
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:12.750
- You know. my parents were divorced.

1117
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:14.106
but I didn't even know it

1118
00:43:14.106 --> 00:43:17.430
because they did this
thing called co-parenting.

1119
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:19.550
where they worked together to raise us

1120
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:23.210
despite their differences.

1121
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:24.790
- So you're saying I should probably

1122
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.310
go help the kids.

1123
00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:29.050
- Hey. (tongue clicks)
that's a great idea.

1124
00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:33.157
I will have them fuel up the jet.

1125
00:43:33.157 --> 00:43:35.470
(Janet sighs)

1126
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:36.613
- Your card bounced.

1127
00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:38.581
- Ugh.

1128
00:43:38.581 --> 00:43:39.414
- Give it to the girl over there.

1129
00:43:39.414 --> 00:43:40.680
I bet she could do it.

1130
00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.330
She knows how to solve the clues.

1131
00:43:43.866 --> 00:43:46.480
- I could crack it if I had the laptop.

1132
00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.480
- Give her the computer!

1133
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.290
I wanna win this contest already!

1134
00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:51.910
I can't spend all my
time lookin' for clues!

1135
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:54.040
We have ice cream to sell!

1136
00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.647
(suspenseful music)

1137
00:43:55.647 --> 00:43:59.340
- [Olivia] Cliff. Lorelei.
skiff. cry. alligator.

1138
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.263
I think I got it.

1139
00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:03.903
- [Jackson] No. no. no. no. no.

1140
00:44:03.903 --> 00:44:05.970
I know the exact Boolean search to do.

1141
00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:06.803
Untie me.

1142
00:44:06.803 --> 00:44:07.636
- Okay.

1143
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.793
If you say so.

1144
00:44:20.659 --> 00:44:21.742
What are you?

1145
00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:24.505
- [Jackson] Lorelei in
the Theater of the Sea.

1146
00:44:24.505 --> 00:44:25.338
We went there on vacation.

1147
00:44:25.338 --> 00:44:27.077
It's in the Keys.

1148
00:44:27.077 --> 00:44:27.996
- [Olivia] What?

1149
00:44:27.996 --> 00:44:29.610
- Just what I thought. Theater of the Sea.

1150
00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:32.230
It has crocodiles. alligators. everything.

1151
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:33.780
It's at the Theater of the Sea.

1152
00:44:34.678 --> 00:44:38.345
(ice cream truck backfires)

1153
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:44.220
- Okay. so what's the plan. Jacks?

1154
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:45.530
- Inside is a public place.

1155
00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:46.640
They can't keep us tied up.

1156
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.320
We'll make a break for it on my cue.

1157
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.573
- Good plan.

1158
00:44:49.573 --> 00:44:51.391
(Chilly and Boss laughing)

1159
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:53.370
- Now you're gonna show
us where the treasure is.

1160
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:54.630
Get over here.

1161
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:56.712
You better stay close.
- Get over here!

1162
00:44:56.712 --> 00:44:58.453
- [Olivia] Let me go. hey.

1163
00:44:58.453 --> 00:45:01.536
(apprehensive music)

1164
00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:03.884
- Oh.

1165
00:45:03.884 --> 00:45:04.717
Mm hmm.

1166
00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.850
Welcome to Spy-Spot.

1167
00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:09.050
I'm I-Spy.

1168
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:09.974
How can I help you?

1169
00:45:09.974 --> 00:45:11.760
- Are you a detective?

1170
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.710
- I'm a spy.

1171
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:13.543
- Whatever.

1172
00:45:13.543 --> 00:45:14.550
My kids are missing.

1173
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:16.291
- You lost your kids?

1174
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:18.080
Did you call the cops?

1175
00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:18.913
- Yes.

1176
00:45:18.913 --> 00:45:21.060
They won't do anything for 48 hours.

1177
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.440
Can you find them?

1178
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.120
- I-Spy can try.

1179
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.900
- What's your real name?

1180
00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:29.050
- I-Spy. I had it changed
for business purposes.

1181
00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:32.530
So do you have any idea
where your kids could be?

1182
00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:34.210
- All I know is they said something

1183
00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.327
about follow your hunch.

1184
00:45:37.327 --> 00:45:38.994
- Follow your hunch.

1185
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:42.450
Oh. the contest. right.

1186
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:44.160
Where you can win a million dollars?

1187
00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.270
Awesome.

1188
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:49.450
So I'll just get into the contest website.

1189
00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:53.120
But first. I'm just gonna need you to sign

1190
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.870
here. here. here. here.

1191
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.000
That's how much it's gonna be.

1192
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.030
which shouldn't be a problem

1193
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:01.943
if your kids win the contest.

1194
00:46:01.943 --> 00:46:04.290
- Oh ho. we got you kids.
- Let go.

1195
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.383
- You're not gettin' away now.

1196
00:46:06.383 --> 00:46:07.744
(dolphin squeaking)

1197
00:46:07.744 --> 00:46:09.319
(ominous music)

1198
00:46:09.319 --> 00:46:10.551
(men struggling)

1199
00:46:10.551 --> 00:46:11.668
- [Jackson] Now. Olivia.

1200
00:46:11.668 --> 00:46:12.501
- Let 'em go.

1201
00:46:12.501 --> 00:46:15.150
- [Olivia] So where are we going?

1202
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.983
- [Boss] Uh. let 'em go.

1203
00:46:15.983 --> 00:46:17.040
We know where the clue is.

1204
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.383
By the alligator exhibit.

1205
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.513
- [Jackson] The alligator exhibit.

1206
00:46:23.264 --> 00:46:24.597
- [Olivia] What?

1207
00:46:25.559 --> 00:46:28.309
(dramatic music)

1208
00:46:30.517 --> 00:46:31.647
- [Boss] Uh. don't worry about it.

1209
00:46:31.647 --> 00:46:34.800
I know where it is.
- It's an easy contest. Boss.

1210
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.650
- Hurry. they're coming.
- Let's go.

1211
00:46:38.638 --> 00:46:39.970
- Hey look. I see something over there.

1212
00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:40.803
- There it is!

1213
00:46:40.803 --> 00:46:41.834
- It's a clue.
- Get it.

1214
00:46:41.834 --> 00:46:43.017
What's it say?
- It's a paper.

1215
00:46:43.017 --> 00:46:43.940
Let me see what it says.

1216
00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:44.773
Ugh.

1217
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:51.190
You two are idiots!

1218
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:52.023
- Idiots?

1219
00:46:52.023 --> 00:46:53.580
Have you seen any idiots?

1220
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.010
- Yeah. you're the idiot.

1221
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:56.843
- Great!

1222
00:46:56.843 --> 00:46:58.890
Maybe I have the clue.

1223
00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:00.760
Check my pockets.

1224
00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.913
Nope. still nothin'. Boss.

1225
00:47:02.913 --> 00:47:03.746
- Uh uh.

1226
00:47:05.351 --> 00:47:06.184
Let's get outta here.

1227
00:47:06.184 --> 00:47:07.060
Let's go find these kids.

1228
00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:07.950
- Got it!

1229
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.086
- [Olivia] Which way to the Lorelei?

1230
00:47:10.086 --> 00:47:12.836
(dramatic music)

1231
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.353
- It's close.

1232
00:47:19.121 --> 00:47:20.660
We need to get to the beach.

1233
00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:21.493
- They're closed.

1234
00:47:21.493 --> 00:47:22.420
You'll have to get there by sea.

1235
00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.670
- We'll take a boat then.

1236
00:47:24.636 --> 00:47:26.286
- I don't rent boats to children.

1237
00:47:29.543 --> 00:47:30.990
- [Jackson] I have an idea.

1238
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:32.250
- All right. we're gonna
go find these kids now.

1239
00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:33.640
- Check the computer. Boss.

1240
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.210
and see what these kids were lookin' at.

1241
00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:36.943
- Ah. let's see what we got here.

1242
00:47:38.215 --> 00:47:40.965
(Olivia humming)

1243
00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.010
- Hi. we'd like a boat.

1244
00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:46.010
- Aye. a boat.

1245
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:47.733
Clearly. you're over 18.

1246
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.940
We need a signature and a
driver's license number.

1247
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.330
- Yes. yes. that's how
we got here. by car.

1248
00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:55.163
- [Man] By car?

1249
00:47:55.163 --> 00:47:56.840
Then you'll like the Cadillac boat.

1250
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:58.743
- There.

1251
00:47:58.743 --> 00:48:00.772
They're at the Lorelei Restaurant.

1252
00:48:00.772 --> 00:48:02.499
- Lorelei. got it. Boss.
- Lorelei. there it is.

1253
00:48:02.499 --> 00:48:03.332
I got it.

1254
00:48:03.332 --> 00:48:04.180
I got it right on here.

1255
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.013
Here it is.

1256
00:48:08.175 --> 00:48:10.534
("The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin)

00:48:10.534 --> 00:48:12.659

1258

(dramatic music)

1259
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:20.227
- [Jackson] We'll take the
Cadillac around to the beach.

00:48:20.227 --> 00:48:22.090
(ice cream truck backfiring)

1261
00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:24.110
- [Olivia] Can you drive this?

1262
00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:25.673
- [Jackson] I can drive anything.

1263
00:48:26.509 --> 00:48:27.613
- [Olivia] Are we unhooked?

1264
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.540
- Hey. did you see a couple of kids

1265
00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.823
come by here to rent a boat?

1266
00:48:30.823 --> 00:48:32.620
- [Man] I don't rent boats to children!

1267
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.053
But they went that way.

1268
00:48:35.375 --> 00:48:36.208
- Go get 'em.

1269
00:48:36.208 --> 00:48:37.041
Let's go get 'em.

1270
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:38.490
Go get 'em.

1271
00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:40.320
- If we don't hurry up.
- Look. there they go!

1272
00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.354
- [Chilly] we'll never
get those kids. Iceman.

1273
00:48:42.354 --> 00:48:44.070
- They're right over there. Chilly.

1274
00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:47.573
- [Chilly] Let's be real pirates.
Boss. and take this boat.

1275
00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.340
- [Boss] There's a lotta
steps here. you know.

1276
00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.390
The boat's creakin'.

1277
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:52.900
The bows are gonna break.

1278
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.050
- [Chilly] Maybe you're
too tall for this boat.

1279
00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:56.200
- I see 'em over there.

1280
00:48:58.771 --> 00:49:01.181
(dramatic music)

1281
00:49:01.181 --> 00:49:02.680
- [Chilly] Fire in the hole!

1282
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.660
- This whole boat is made out of plastic.

1283
00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:05.498
It's not even real.

1284
00:49:05.498 --> 00:49:06.331
Look. look. look!

1285
00:49:06.331 --> 00:49:07.164
They're goin' slow.

1286
00:49:07.164 --> 00:49:08.902
I think we can catch 'em.

1287
00:49:08.902 --> 00:49:10.220
(slow jazz music)

1288
00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.020
- Do you have your kids' email addresses?

1289
00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:16.400
- Yeah. um. that and
some other stuff there.

1290
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.600
- [I-Spy] Okay.

1291
00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.321
- [Olivia] Is this as fast as it goes?

1292
00:49:19.321 --> 00:49:20.154
(dramatic music)

1293
00:49:20.154 --> 00:49:21.780
- This thing sure is slow!

1294
00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.770
It's like we're movin' backwards. Boss.

1295
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:26.600
- Both boats are slower than molasses!

1296
00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.070
We're never gonna get these kids.

1297
00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:30.611
Go down below and find
something now. will ya?

1298
00:49:30.611 --> 00:49:31.444
They're gonna get away!

1299
00:49:31.444 --> 00:49:32.610
- Got it. Boss.

1300
00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:33.670
- [Olivia] Where is the beach?

1301
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:34.503
- [Jackson] According to the map.

1302
00:49:34.503 --> 00:49:35.410
it's right around the corner.

1303
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:37.890
- So much junk down here.

1304
00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:39.450
Think I found somethin'. Boss!

1305
00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:40.670
- [Iceman] Come on. let's go.

1306
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:42.376
We gotta stop these kids.

1307
00:49:42.376 --> 00:49:45.650
(Chilly laughing)

1308
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:47.870
- Lookit what I got. Boss!

1309
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:49.480
This'll stop 'em.

1310
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.330
- Is there anything they've
been doing this summer?

1311
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:55.355
- Olivia likes unicorns.

1312
00:49:55.355 --> 00:49:56.350
Ugh.

1313
00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:58.423
Mermaids. uh.

1314
00:49:59.287 --> 00:50:01.830
"Should. Could and Would."

1315
00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:02.784
Um.

1316
00:50:02.784 --> 00:50:04.180
(slow jazz music)

1317
00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.780
- Maybe something more personal?

1318
00:50:06.807 --> 00:50:07.640
- This is outrageous!

1319
00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.963
This is just.

1320
00:50:10.065 --> 00:50:11.902
Do me a favor. just get the harpoon.

1321
00:50:11.902 --> 00:50:13.050
and let's shoot these guys already.

1322
00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:13.890
Please!

1323
00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:14.723
Look at this thing.

1324
00:50:14.723 --> 00:50:16.046
I look like a joke!

1325
00:50:16.046 --> 00:50:18.796
(dramatic music)

1326
00:50:20.387 --> 00:50:22.637
All right. Chilly. line
'em up nice and easy.

1327
00:50:23.543 --> 00:50:24.945
Shoot 'em!

1328
00:50:24.945 --> 00:50:26.445
Shoot 'em already!

1329
00:50:28.372 --> 00:50:30.574
(both laughing)

1330
00:50:30.574 --> 00:50:31.470
We got 'em.
- Got 'em!

1331
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:32.539
- We're hit.

1332
00:50:32.539 --> 00:50:33.972
- Yes. yes!
- Yeah!

1333
00:50:33.972 --> 00:50:36.472
(light music)

1334
00:50:37.343 --> 00:50:39.410
- [Olivia] Man. that was a perfect shot.

1335
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:41.330
So much smoke and oil.

1336
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:42.700
It's spraying all over the place.

1337
00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.400
- [Jackson] I can still get us to shore.

1338
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.453
- Victory is ours. (laughs)

1339
00:50:46.453 --> 00:50:47.993
- We got you kids!

1340
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:50.944
Looks kinda shallow there. Boss.

1341
00:50:50.944 --> 00:50:53.469
- [Iceman] (laughing) It's too shallow

1342
00:50:53.469 --> 00:50:54.302
where they're heading.

1343
00:50:54.302 --> 00:50:55.900
- [Chilly] What's the draft on this boat?

1344
00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:56.960
- [Iceman] We have to
double back to the dock.

1345
00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.030
- [Chilly] See what I see?

1346
00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:01.070
They're there. we gotta go there.

1347
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:03.323
- [Iceman] Those kids are
headed to that beach cove.

1348
00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.193
- [Jackson] Lorelei Cove.

1349
00:51:05.193 --> 00:51:07.126
According to the map. it's
too shallow for their boat.

1350
00:51:07.126 --> 00:51:08.426
They'll have to go around.

1351
00:51:11.046 --> 00:51:13.463
(airy music)

1352
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:19.320
- [Olivia] Where do you think the clue is?

1353
00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:20.450
- [Jackson] This is the end of the beach.

1354
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:21.710
The clue has to be here somewhere.

1355
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:24.143
- [Olivia] And what is
that creepy singing?

1356
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:27.010
And what's a skiff?

1357
00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:28.730
- I don't know. a boat maybe?

1358
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:30.570
- [Olivia] We're at the end of the beach.

1359
00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:32.150
Why does everything smell?

1360
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:33.620
I don't see a cliff.

1361
00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.540
There's no rocks or anything.

1362
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:36.470
This is Florida.

1363
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:38.300
We don't have mountains.

1364
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.600
All we have is trash mountains.

1365
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.057
- Mermaids. uh.

1366
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:46.801
- There's no cliffs anywhere!

1367
00:51:46.801 --> 00:51:49.253
- (sighs) Let's just sit
here and be sad about life.

1368
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.170
What are we doing?

1369
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:55.003
- I know.

1370
00:51:55.003 --> 00:51:56.260
We're so far from home.

1371
00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:58.220
Well. at least we're on an adventure.

1372
00:51:58.220 --> 00:51:59.710
- A terrible adventure!

1373
00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:01.483
- Terribly awesome!

1374
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.730
I mean. like. it's all
about the perspective.

1375
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:06.530
Who else gets to go on an adventure?

1376
00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.137
- This is so stupid!

1377
00:52:14.774 --> 00:52:16.703
(illuminating music)

1378
00:52:16.703 --> 00:52:18.090
Liv. get up.

1379
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:18.923
Get up.

1380
00:52:18.923 --> 00:52:20.525
Come on. get up.

1381
00:52:20.525 --> 00:52:21.630
Cliff's skiff.

1382
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:23.280
Skiff is another name for a boat.

1383
00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.247
- Under the cliff.

1384
00:52:28.906 --> 00:52:32.073
(investigating music)

1385
00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:37.580
There's something here.

1386
00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.893
- [Jackson] Can you get it?

1387
00:52:44.875 --> 00:52:45.710
(Olivia gasps)

1388
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.230
(wondrous music)

1389
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.530
- [Olivia] A coin. a clue.

1390
00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:56.066
- [Jackson] We're in.

1391
00:52:56.066 --> 00:52:58.816
(exciting music)

1392
00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.760
- I must say. I am thoroughly impressed.

1393
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.370
I had my doubts that anyone
could make it this far.

1394
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:09.557
but yet. here you are.

1395
00:53:09.557 --> 00:53:11.530
So let's get down to it. shall we?

1396
00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:13.650
We've discussed the air and the sea.

1397
00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:15.390
but at hand is the land.

1398
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:18.260
where we shall solve the biggest mystery.

1399
00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.890
You must find a marker of the sea.

1400
00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:23.510
The key is where the three come to be

1401
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:26.994
at a point established in 1983.

1402
00:53:26.994 --> 00:53:29.470
(exciting music)

1403
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:32.030
- [Olivia] Mom's always
said she was born in 1983

1404
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:34.123
at the Southernmost Point in Key West.

1405
00:53:35.889 --> 00:53:38.500
Excuse me. do you know how
we can get to Key West?

1406
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.770
- [Woman] Yeah. you can
take Wild Bill's Biplanes.

1407
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:42.591
- [Olivia] Thank you.

1408
00:53:42.591 --> 00:53:43.424
(slow jazz music)

1409
00:53:43.424 --> 00:53:44.510
- Action. not inaction.

1410
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:45.343
We're in!

1411
00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:49.670
So here I can actually
see the last location

1412
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:51.470
they were. the last clue they found.

1413
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:53.080
and it looks like that was Islamorada.

1414
00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.538
- [Brad] Wow. that's great.

1415
00:53:54.538 --> 00:53:55.890
(exciting music)

1416
00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:57.470
- What pilot is going to let

1417
00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:00.800
two alone kids fly on his plane?

1418
00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.350
What kind of crazy. insane.
ludicrous pilot would do that?

1419
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:06.810
- Nothing is going to stop us.

1420
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:09.423
Here. take my phone and call Biplane Bill.

1421
00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:11.930
- Here's the phone number.

1422
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:13.480
Got it.

1423
00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.845
- [Bill] Conch Republic Air Force Tours.

1424
00:54:14.845 --> 00:54:15.678
this is Biplane Bill.

1425
00:54:15.678 --> 00:54:17.067
- Hello.
- Howdy. ma'am.

1426
00:54:17.067 --> 00:54:20.350
- My two kids have been
dying to see their dad

1427
00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:22.980
near the Southernmost Point.
- Yes. ma'am. I understand.

1428
00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:23.947
- Yes. yes.
- Yes. how can I help you?

1429
00:54:23.947 --> 00:54:27.560
- You fly from Islamorada
to Key West. don't you?

1430
00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.550
- [Bill] Twice a day.

1431
00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:29.553
but for two kids. you'll have to sign

1432
00:54:29.553 --> 00:54:30.521
that online waiver form.

1433
00:54:30.521 --> 00:54:31.354
- What?

1434
00:54:31.354 --> 00:54:34.069
I have to sign the online waiver?

1435
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.902
- [Bill] Yes. ma'am.

1436
00:54:34.902 --> 00:54:36.860
everybody under 18
- If I must.

1437
00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:39.611
I guess I'll have to go the extra mile.

1438
00:54:39.611 --> 00:54:41.190
- [Bill] Well now. ma'am.
it's not really an extra mile.

1439
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:42.023
It's on the internet.

1440
00:54:42.023 --> 00:54:43.010
You can just sign it right there

1441
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:45.180
on the phone or any kind of tablet.

1442
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.251
- Excuse me.

1443
00:54:46.251 --> 00:54:48.370
You seen these two little
kids runnin' around here?

1444
00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:50.673
- Yeah. they went to Wild Bill's Biplanes.

1445
00:54:50.673 --> 00:54:51.898

1446
00:54:51.898 --> 00:54:53.120

- Two kids. back that way.

1447
00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:53.953

1448
00:54:53.953 --> 00:54:55.287
- All right.
- That way.

1449
00:54:55.287 --> 00:54:56.120

1450
00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.760
- That's it.
- Let's go. Boss.

1451
00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.070
- Okay. I think I got us signed up.

1452
00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:01.630
It should be right over there.

1453
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:02.700
- [Jackson] Let's go!

1454
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.468
Play the dramatic music.

1455
00:55:04.468 --> 00:55:07.218
(dramatic music)

1456
00:55:08.753 --> 00:55:10.170
(slow jazz music)

1457
00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:13.850
- So the Southernmost Point
was established in 1983.

1458
00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:15.393
- By land. air and sea.

1459
00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.900
Let's go. Key West.

1460
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.210
- We'll never make it down there.

1461
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:21.523
The traffic's really bad.

1462
00:55:26.085 --> 00:55:28.502
(Brad sighs)

1463
00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.123
- How about by jet-ski?

1464
00:55:33.685 --> 00:55:38.595
- Mm hmm. (chuckles)

1465
00:55:38.595 --> 00:55:41.345
(dramatic music)

1466
00:55:48.198 --> 00:55:50.865
(frantic music)

1467
00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:55.533
- Hey. kids.

1468
00:55:55.533 --> 00:55:57.880
Welcome to the Conch
Republic Air Force Tours.

1469
00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:59.040
How can I help you today?

1470
00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.820
- We needed a tour to Key West.

1471
00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:03.060
- We go from Islamorada down to Key West.

1472
00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.230
You guys got $200?

1473
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:07.580
It's $200 per person.

1474
00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:10.002
Did your parents sign that online waiver?

1475
00:56:10.002 --> 00:56:11.400
- Yes.

1476
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.940
- Two kids. I got a call about it too.

1477
00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:14.773
One to.

1478
00:56:14.773 --> 00:56:16.312
Oh look. kids. ice cream!

1481
00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.370
I'm gonna go get you some
Huncha Munchas for your ride.

1482
00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:23.000
How's that sound?

1483
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.623
All right. y'all go get
loaded up in the front seat.

1484
00:56:26.938 --> 00:56:28.305
(dramatic music)

1485
00:56:28.305 --> 00:56:32.573
- [Olivia] I guess
somebody's had their coffee.

1486
00:56:32.573 --> 00:56:35.120
- Hey. I need two of them Huncha Munchas.

1487
00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.313
- Why not three?

1488
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.000
- Have you seen a coupla
kids come by here?

1489
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.680
- Yeah. they're in the plane right now.

1490
00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:41.980
- Chilly. see if you can get us a plane

1491
00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:42.813
to get us up there.

1492
00:56:42.813 --> 00:56:43.740
- Can we get a plane to get up there

1493
00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.470
with those dirty faced kids?

1494
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:47.370
- No. I only got the one.

1495
00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:48.973
Be back in a few hours.

1496
00:56:48.973 --> 00:56:51.863
Kids said somethin'

1497
00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:54.510

1498
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:56.100
I have an idea.

1499
00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:57.510

1500
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:59.900

1501
00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.863

1510
00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:21.930
- Well. you're not coming with me.

1511
00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:23.660

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:25.060
and you still owe me the remainder.

1513
00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:25.893

1518
00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.770

The runway is right there.

1530
00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:53.923

- How am I gonna do that. Boss?

1536
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:01.470
- Do you remember when I told you

1537
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:04.310

1538
00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:05.400

00:59:34.094 --> 00:59:36.344
This is actually not speed.

- [Iceman] Hey. there's no way

1612
01:03:12.303 --> 01:03:13.297
these stupid kids are gonna find it.

1613
01:03:13.297 --> 01:03:15.170
- The clue has to be here.
- It's not.

1614
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:17.372
Somebody must've beat us to it.

1615
01:03:17.372 --> 01:03:18.630
- Jackson!
- Look!

1616
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:20.111
- Olivia.

1617
01:03:20.111 --> 01:03:20.944
Hey.
- Hey.

1618
01:03:20.944 --> 01:03:23.180
- I told you nobody could solve it.

1619
01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:25.837
especially a dumb girl like you.

1620
01:03:25.837 --> 01:03:27.897
- You couldn't find the clue
if it bit you in the nose.

1621
01:03:27.897 --> 01:03:28.816
- [I-Spy] Hey!

1622
01:03:28.816 --> 01:03:30.758
- Or if it slapped you in the face.

1623
01:03:30.758 --> 01:03:32.230
- Ugh!

1624
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:33.843
- Get off of me!
- Hey. that's child abuse!

1625
01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:35.100
- Ugh!
- Ow!

1626
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.142
- Get your hands off my kids!

1627
01:03:37.142 --> 01:03:37.975
- Hey!

1628
01:03:37.975 --> 01:03:38.808
I told you I'd find them.

1629
01:03:38.808 --> 01:03:39.700
- Stay there!

1630
01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.560
I'll be right there.

1631
01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.977
Don't move!

1632
01:03:41.977 --> 01:03:43.403
- Just wait.

1633
01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:44.910
- [Olivia] Are you okay?

1634
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:46.020
- [Jackson] Olivia. there's a rope.

1635
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.320
- [Olivia] Where do you think he goes?

1636
01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.174
- [Jackson] In a drain.
kind of suspicious.

1637
01:03:49.174 --> 01:03:50.405
- [Olivia] Let's follow it.

1638
01:03:50.405 --> 01:03:53.155
(dramatic music)

1639
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:57.300
- [Jackson] Look. a marker of the sea.

1640
01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.960
- [Olivia] Where the three come to be.

1641
01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.670
land. air and sea.

1642
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:01.943
Let's pull it in.

1643
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.303
- [Jackson] Come on.

1644
01:04:17.164 --> 01:04:17.997
- Whoa.

1645
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.583
- [Chilly] What are these kids doing now?

1646
01:04:28.924 --> 01:04:30.630
- [Iceman] Uh. these kids
are just wastin' their time.

1647
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:33.138
Look at this. they're playin' with a ball.

1648
01:04:33.138 --> 01:04:33.971
- [Chilly] They're trash collectors.

1649
01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:37.004
- Hurry up. Jackson.
- Trash collectors. Boss.

1650
01:04:37.004 --> 01:04:38.660
- Let's go.
- Kids are dumb.

1651
01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:39.760
- Are you guys okay?

1652
01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.570
- Dad. how did you find us?

1653
01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:42.450
- He didn't.

1654
01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:43.450
I found you.

1655
01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:45.990
Another case solved. 100%.

1656
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:47.300
- Who's this?

1657
01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.670
- Uh. Spy. I-Spy.

1658
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:50.980
- Who are these guys?

1659
01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.534
- Remember the ice cream men?

1660
01:04:53.534 --> 01:04:54.530
- Did they hurt you?

1661
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:55.897
- Nah. they just kidnapped us.

1662
01:04:55.897 --> 01:04:58.080
But we could've gotten away at any point.

1663
01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.000
They're too stupid.

1664
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.060
- We let them kidnap us

1665
01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.020
so we could get down to
the Southernmost Point.

1666
01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.700
It's like reverse psychology.

1667
01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.306
- You hitchhiked with kidnappers?

1668
01:05:07.306 --> 01:05:08.190
- Epic!

1669
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:09.630
Nice move. kids.

1670
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:11.753
- What is wrong with you?

1671
01:05:11.753 --> 01:05:12.771
- Ugh.

1672
01:05:12.771 --> 01:05:15.680
- Looks like it's back to
livin' the dream. huh. Boss?

1673
01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.798
- Yeah well. those kids look real happy.

1674
01:05:17.798 --> 01:05:18.631
- Hmm.

1675
01:05:18.631 --> 01:05:19.760
(funny music)

1676
01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.060
- [I-Spy] Hey. hey. you
still owe me a balance.

1677
01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:23.110
- You didn't do anything.

1678
01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:24.452
I did all the work.

1679
01:05:24.452 --> 01:05:25.285
- [I-Spy] What do you mean?

1680
01:05:25.285 --> 01:05:26.560
I got us all the way here.

1681
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.650
- [Brad] I didn't even want you to come.

1682
01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:29.483
- [I-Spy] Which reminds me.

1683
01:05:29.483 --> 01:05:31.796
do you have a way to get us back?

1684
01:05:31.796 --> 01:05:34.137
- [Brad] (sighs) We'll have to get a car.

1685
01:05:34.137 --> 01:05:35.970
It's gonna cost a fortune.

1686
01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:37.670
- [Olivia] Let's take the jet-ski home.

1687
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:38.690
- [Brad] No. honey.

1688
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:41.240
We can't all fit on the jet-ski.

1689
01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.760
I can't believe you guys.

1690
01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.370
What were you thinking?

1691
01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:46.290
- [Jackson] We were tryin' to
win a million dollars. Dad.

1692
01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:47.620
and save the whole world

1693
01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.753
after your generation screwed it up.

1694

("The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin)

1695
01:05:51.769 --> 01:05:53.150
- Come on. Chilly. let's go.

1696
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:55.120
Those kids look suspicious.

1697
01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.850
I think it's a good idea

1698
01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:58.153
we go stake out the house.

1699
01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:00.243
- A stakeout?

1700
01:06:04.298 --> 01:06:07.381
(light bouncy music)

1701
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.054
- [Jackson] Dad. do we
have to take a shower?

1702
01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:15.790
- Ugh. it's fine.

1703
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:17.540
We'll just clean up in the morning.

1704
01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:23.063
I can't believe we. we made it.

1705
01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.303
We're. we're home.

1706
01:06:29.134 --> 01:06:29.967
Ah.

1707
01:06:32.504 --> 01:06:33.337
Ah.

1708
01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.630
Well. that was some terrible adventure

1709
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:48.100
you two were on.
- Nah. it was awesome.

1710
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:50.420
Well. I could say it was
a terrible adventure.

1711
01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.331
but. the truth is. we had a blast.

1712
01:06:52.331 --> 01:06:53.164
- Really?

1713
01:06:53.164 --> 01:06:54.670
- And. plus. we were doing it for you.

1714
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:55.860
- [Brad] What do you mean?

1715
01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.500
- If we could've solved the puzzle.

1716
01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:01.649
we could've won one
million dollars and a job.

1717
01:07:01.649 --> 01:07:02.620
- Oh. that's sweet. honey.

1718
01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:05.040
but I'm pretty sure you
have to be an adult.

1719
01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.610
- They presume it'll be an adult. I think.

1720
01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:09.500
but I read the terms of services.

1721
01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.360
It doesn't specify any age.

1722
01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.300
Either way. they're
selling it on ice cream!

1723
01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:15.830
- I don't want you guys
to worry about that.

1724
01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:17.480
We're gonna figure something out.

1725
01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.089
All right. kid. time to get some sleep.

1726
01:07:29.089 --> 01:07:31.100
- (sighs) We were so close.

1727
01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.273
We almost won.

1728
01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.010
- Yeah. well. you need to be home

1729
01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:40.593
on electronics. doing
nothing like a normal kid.

1730
01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.052
- Okay.

1731
01:07:43.052 --> 01:07:45.953
- (sighs) I'm sure it goes without saying.

1732
01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:48.820
but you better never.

1733
01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:53.463
ever. ever do anything
like that ever again.

1734
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:59.950
- [Jackson] Okay.

1735
01:08:00.348 --> 01:08:02.931
(sneaky music)

1736
01:08:18.972 --> 01:08:20.924

- I'm gonna pull up around
the corner over here.

1742
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:50.420
See the spot?

1743
01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.660
That's where we're gonna
go do the stakeout.

1744
01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:53.690
- Steak?

1745
01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:55.340
I love steak!

1746
01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.070
- I'm not talkin' about food!

1747
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:59.390
I'm talkin' about watchin'
the house with the kids!

1748
01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:00.963
You keep talking about steak!

01:09:04.008 --> 01:09:07.023
I can't believe that you got
a delivery this time of day!

1751
01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:10.670
- Well. you said it was a stakeout. Boss!

1752
01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:12.350
This is steak.

1753
01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:13.483
and we're out!

- [Olivia] Play it.

1774
01:10:00.791 --> 01:10:01.901
Let's check it out.

1775

1778

for which you must find the key.

and wars to save humanity.

in the fortress of the saint.

1789
01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.230
When you open the lock.

you will find the solution

1791
01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.967

Get over the fence.

1885
01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:42.846

Let me know.
- Got it. Boss.

1895
01:13:55.413 --> 01:13:56.529

1896
01:13:56.529 --> 01:13:59.279
(dramatic music)

1897
01:14:19.572 --> 01:14:22.322
(dramatic music)

1898
01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:26.930
- [Chilly] No kids here.

1899
01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.153

01:14:44.361 --> 01:14:46.280

1901
01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.559

1902
01:14:49.559 --> 01:14:51.976

01:15:16.163 --> 01:15:19.246
(light bouncy music)

1908
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:22.756
- All aboard!

1909
01:15:22.756 --> 01:15:25.480
This train goes to Orlando. St. Augustine

1910
01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.440

1911
01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.010

1915
01:15:37.503 --> 01:15:40.170
(frantic music)

1916
01:15:42.690 --> 01:15:44.133

1917
01:15:54.997 --> 01:15:55.830
Ugh.

1918
01:15:58.459 --> 01:16:01.860

1919
01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:02.850

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.480
- On a train.

1922
01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.880
- On a train?

1923
01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.470
What are you doing on a train?

1924
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:13.160
- We have some unfinished business.

1925
01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.640
- Where are you going?

1926
01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.110

1927
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:16.943
Remember?

1928
01:16:16.943 --> 01:16:17.800
I went there on a school trip.

1929
01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.750
- You can't just go to St. Augustine.

1930
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:20.583
- Why not?

1931
01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:23.050
- Because you're a kid. and
you don't have permission.

1932
01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:24.440
- We're kinda doing it for you.

1933
01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:25.273
- What?

1934
01:16:25.273 --> 01:16:26.810
- We're gonna win the contest.

1935
01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:29.030
get some money and buy the house.

1936
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.900
- No.

1937
01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.940
You need to get off that train right now.

1938
01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.103
- End of discussion.

1939
01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:35.763
- Jackson?

1940
01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:38.580
- What are you looking at?

1941
01:16:40.224 --> 01:16:42.261
- I was just wondering if we
can get some Huncha Munchas.

1942
01:16:42.261 --> 01:16:43.313
- Huncha Munchas?

1943
01:16:43.313 --> 01:16:44.563
- From the ice cream man.

1944
01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:46.648
(perilous music)

1945
01:16:46.648 --> 01:16:48.268
- What are we gonna do?

1946
01:16:48.268 --> 01:16:49.878
- Where you at?

1947
01:16:49.878 --> 01:16:50.961
Where you at?

1948
01:16:57.697 --> 01:16:59.787
Where are you at. kiddos?

1949
01:16:59.787 --> 01:17:01.180

1950
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.648
There you are!

1951
01:17:02.648 --> 01:17:03.731
Say sayonara.

1952
01:17:04.738 --> 01:17:06.347
Here I come.

1953
01:17:06.347 --> 01:17:08.229

1955
01:17:11.083 --> 01:17:13.833
(dramatic music)

1956
01:17:18.315 --> 01:17:19.565

1957
01:17:21.258 --> 01:17:22.696
- Go. go. go.

1958
01:17:22.696 --> 01:17:24.297
- [Olivia] Hurry.

1959
01:17:24.297 --> 01:17:25.547
- [Chilly] Ugh!

1960
01:17:26.784 --> 01:17:28.034
Gimme that key!

1961
01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:30.747
- [Man] Hey!

1962
01:17:30.747 --> 01:17:31.912
- Can't you knock?
- We need to find

1963
01:17:31.912 --> 01:17:32.974
a place to hide.
- I'm gonna get you!

1964
01:17:32.974 --> 01:17:34.632
- Quickly!
- All these rooms are full!

1965
01:17:34.632 --> 01:17:36.320
- [Passenger] Hey. this room is occupied!

1966
01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.770
- [Jackson] Come on. in here.

1967
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:40.478
- [Olivia] Not here. go across.

1968
01:17:40.478 --> 01:17:41.378
Come on. let's go.

1969
01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:48.314
Shh. quiet.

1970
01:17:49.499 --> 01:17:52.210
Ready. go.
- They're in here!

1971
01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:54.071
- Wait for it.
- This is confusing.

1972
01:17:54.071 --> 01:17:55.570
- [Olivia] Let's go.

1973
01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:57.956
- [Chilly] What am I. teleporting?

1974
01:17:57.956 --> 01:17:59.303
Is this a wormhole?

1975
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:04.380
Is there a bend in the
fabric of space time?

1976
01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:05.253
I'm so confused!

1977
01:18:06.719 --> 01:18:08.690
- And now!
- Is this a crazy dream?

1978
01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:11.600
Some kind of weird clown car?
- Let's make a break for it.

1979
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.343
- [Jackson] The coast is clear. hurry!

1980
01:18:15.747 --> 01:18:18.164
(rock music)

1981
01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.140
- No time to explain. Janet.

1982
01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:27.063
I'll be there.

1983
01:18:28.122 --> 01:18:29.540
At the private airport.

1984
01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.663
My truck was repossessed. by the way.

1985
01:18:34.473 --> 01:18:36.283
(sighs) I am gonna get those kids.

1986
01:18:50.585 --> 01:18:52.774
(people talking)

1987
01:18:52.774 --> 01:18:53.950
- [Jackson] I have an idea.

1988
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:56.270
Uh. ma'am. can I take
your bags to the back?

1989
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:57.103
- Oh. sure.

1990
01:18:57.103 --> 01:18:58.403
Thank you so much. young man.

1991
01:18:59.421 --> 01:19:02.504
(light bouncy music)

1992
01:19:04.666 --> 01:19:06.450
- [Jackson] We have to find
something inconspicuous.

1993
01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:07.987
- [Olivia] Got it.

1994
01:19:07.987 --> 01:19:09.323
What does inconspicuous mean?

1995
01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.050
- This is what you
brought. my old scooter?

1996
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.830
- You always hated this scooter.

1997
01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:18.430
and I got it for you.

1998
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:20.260
- We're gonna get there on this thing?

1999
01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:21.420
What are you thinking?

2000
01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.490
- Don't. don't worry about it.

2001
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:23.323
Just get on.

2002
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:32.729
(funny music)

2003
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:37.100
(dramatic music)

2004
01:19:44.355 --> 01:19:45.188
- Yah!

2005
01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:48.366
Hey.

2006
01:19:48.366 --> 01:19:49.510
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

2007
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:50.660
- [Jackson] Act normal.

2008
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:53.460
- Have you seen?

2009
01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.190
Guys. have you seen two little kids

2010
01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:57.490
about yeah big. dirty faces?

2011
01:19:57.490 --> 01:19:58.323
Hey.

2012
01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.270
Excuse me. sir.

2013
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:03.010
Fine. ma'am. (chuckles)

2014
01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:05.525
Have you seen two little kids?

2015
01:20:05.525 --> 01:20:07.320
- About 12 and nine years old?

2016
01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.153
- Yeah.

2017
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:10.440
- No. sorry. I'm just having a spot of tea

2018
01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.455
with the samurai.

2019
01:20:11.455 --> 01:20:14.288
(Olivia slurping)

2020
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.519
- Huh?

2021
01:20:19.519 --> 01:20:20.352
Uh.

2022
01:20:26.744 --> 01:20:27.577
Ew!

2023
01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:34.953
Ugh.

2024
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:41.753
Hmm.

2025
01:20:50.143 --> 01:20:53.220
Hey. wait a minute.

2026
01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:55.127
You're not even old!

2027
01:20:55.127 --> 01:20:56.310
- [Jackson] No. no. waiter!

2028
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.173
- I knew it was you kids.
- Sir. sir. you can't be

2029
01:20:59.173 --> 01:21:00.050
in here without a ticket.

2030
01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:02.200
- Hey. hey. what.

2031
01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.370
- I am so sorry about that.
- But. we're gonna.

2032
01:21:03.370 --> 01:21:04.850
I'm gonna.
- Come on.

2033
01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:06.490
let's go. sir.
- The treasure's ours. kids!

2034
01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:08.447
- [Conductor] Calm down. sir.

2035
01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:10.248
(Chilly struggling)

2036
01:21:10.248 --> 01:21:12.998
(dramatic music)

2037
01:21:15.409 --> 01:21:16.510
(Chilly yells)

2038
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:17.343
- And stay out!

2039
01:21:17.343 --> 01:21:18.830
- No tickets.
- No service.

2040
01:21:21.582 --> 01:21:22.640
(dramatic music)

2041
01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.850
- I know where they're going!

2042
01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:25.730
- Let's go.
- Ha. I know

2043
01:21:25.730 --> 01:21:27.330
where they're goin'. Boss.

2044
01:21:27.330 --> 01:21:30.182
St. Augustine! (laughs)

2045
01:21:30.182 --> 01:21:33.015
(hard rock music)

2046
01:21:47.801 --> 01:21:48.634
- We're gonna make it.
- I don't think

2047
01:21:48.634 --> 01:21:49.467
we're gonna make it!

2048
01:21:49.467 --> 01:21:50.550
I don't know how I let
you talk me into this!

2049
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:52.910
- Just eight more hours.

2050
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:53.743
Hang in there.

2051
01:21:54.979 --> 01:21:57.581
You can do it for the kids.

2052
01:21:57.581 --> 01:22:00.914
(train whistle blowing)

2053
01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:13.000
(suspenseful music)

2054
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:13.993
- [Olivia] Which way is it?

2055
01:22:13.993 --> 01:22:15.780
- Come on. hurry.

2056
01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.633
It's this way.
- It's that way.

2057
01:22:18.670 --> 01:22:19.503
We're close.

2058
01:22:19.503 --> 01:22:20.336
It's right there.

2059
01:22:26.446 --> 01:22:28.400
(light bouncy music)

2060
01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.030
- They're closed.

2061
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:31.693
Liv. ice cream men.

2062
01:22:33.230 --> 01:22:36.190
Look. you go. and I'll hold them off.

2063
01:22:36.190 --> 01:22:37.650
- Action. not inaction.

2064
01:22:37.650 --> 01:22:39.270
Here. take this sword.

2065
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:40.103
You might need it.

2066
01:22:40.103 --> 01:22:42.549
And remember. get that key.

2067
01:22:42.549 --> 01:22:45.299
(dramatic music)

2068
01:22:58.698 --> 01:22:59.584
- [Jackson] Where do you think

2069
01:22:59.584 --> 01:23:00.570
you're going?
- Oh. there you are.

2070
01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:03.069
I got somethin' you're lookin' for.

2071
01:23:03.069 --> 01:23:05.022
- [Jackson] That's ours!

2072
01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:06.019
Ha!
- Ugh.

2073
01:23:06.019 --> 01:23:08.058
Now this is mine.

2074
01:23:08.058 --> 01:23:09.717
Ha ha. it's broken.

2075
01:23:09.717 --> 01:23:10.550
It won't open!

2076
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:11.383
- [Jackson] It's a prop.

2077
01:23:11.383 --> 01:23:12.677
There's no blade. Huncha Muncha man.

2078
01:23:12.677 --> 01:23:13.970
- Oh. a prop.

2079
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:15.313
Well then. it's on.

2080
01:23:16.405 --> 01:23:17.806
- [Jackson] Let's dance.

2081
01:23:17.806 --> 01:23:19.380
- Hee ah!
- Yah!

2082
01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:22.769
(both grunting)

2083
01:23:22.769 --> 01:23:23.602
- Oh!

2084
01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.210
- [Olivia] Clue. clue.

2085
01:23:29.210 --> 01:23:30.580
Under here.

2086
01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:31.413
Nothing here.

2087
01:23:32.303 --> 01:23:33.723
Uh. where could it be?

2088
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:43.460
Illuminated portals three.

2089
01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:44.343
I need the key.

2090
01:23:46.348 --> 01:23:49.015
(both grunting)

2091
01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:57.258
- This is ours.
- You're never gonna get it.

2092
01:23:57.258 --> 01:23:58.747
- It's always been ours.
- Never gonna get it.

2093
01:23:58.747 --> 01:23:59.580
Ugh.

2094
01:24:00.427 --> 01:24:01.844
- I need the key.

2095
01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:05.090
- I was certainly surprised to monitor

2096
01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:06.650
the security cameras to see

2097
01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:10.150
that this puzzle may
be solved by children!

2098
01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:12.010
It was designed for adults.

2099
01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:13.670
designed by adult minds

2100
01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:15.840
to be signed by adult analysis.

2101
01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.350
But these children may
be the most brilliant

2102
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:19.317
geniuses of all.

2103
01:24:19.317 --> 01:24:22.063
and they have solved the
key of the Planet Puzzlers.

2104
01:24:27.768 --> 01:24:30.590
- Whew. we made it.

2105
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:31.833
- We sure did.

2106
01:24:32.802 --> 01:24:34.398
Ew. what happened to your face?

2107
01:24:34.398 --> 01:24:35.231
- Ow. ow. ow!

2108
01:24:35.231 --> 01:24:36.680
- It's all burnt.

2109
01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.573
Why didn't you use sunscreen?

2110
01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:41.970
- How do you still look perfect?

2111
01:24:41.970 --> 01:24:43.930
- Well. number one. I wear sunscreen.

2112
01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:45.730
I exfoliate and moisturize.

2113
01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:48.310
I tone. multivitamins.

2114
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:49.270
eight glasses of water.

2115
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:50.998
- All right.
- A good night's sleep.

2116
01:24:50.998 --> 01:24:51.831
- All right.

2117
01:24:51.831 --> 01:24:53.220
let's just get the kids.
- Vegetables.

2118
01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:54.890
So your truck was repossessed?

2119
01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:56.060
- [Brad] Yeah. I missed a payment.

2120
01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:58.000
Someone drained my bank account.

2121
01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.500
- [Janet] I did go a little crazy.

2122
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:02.100
I think we can be a little more amicable.

2123
01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:03.440
I've been learning about this new thing

2124
01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.800
called co-parenting.

2125
01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.485
- Iceman!
- Chilly. where are you?

2126
01:25:06.485 --> 01:25:09.046
- Iceman. down here!
- Chilly. where are you?

2127
01:25:09.046 --> 01:25:10.155
- Iceman!
- Hey. Chilly. how did

2128
01:25:10.155 --> 01:25:11.640
you get down there?
- Help me out!

2129
01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.400
- What. what. where are the kids?

2130
01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.670
- [Chilly] They got the key!

2131
01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:15.503
- Where's the key?

2132
01:25:15.503 --> 01:25:16.664
They got the key?

2133
01:25:16.664 --> 01:25:17.497
How did they get the key?

2134
01:25:17.497 --> 01:25:19.200
- [Chilly] The little
kid kicked my keister

2135
01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.270
and stole the key!

2136
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:22.550
- You let 'em get away with the key?

2137
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.833
Come on. man.
- They got it. Iceman.

2138
01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.837
Oh. Scrooge McMoneygills.
- You let them

2139
01:25:27.837 --> 01:25:29.535
get away with the key?
- Scrooge McMoneygills.

2140
01:25:29.535 --> 01:25:30.820
- Who. who's that?

2141
01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:32.944
- [Chilly] Scrooge McMoneygills.

2142
01:25:32.944 --> 01:25:35.750
- W-what's he doin' here?

2143
01:25:37.647 --> 01:25:40.647
(suspenseful music)

2144
01:25:47.755 --> 01:25:51.088
(floorboards squeaking)

2145
01:25:58.553 --> 01:25:59.890
- The lock in the box

2146
01:25:59.890 --> 01:26:02.307
in the fortress of the saint.

2147
01:26:12.453 --> 01:26:15.203
(wondrous music)

2148
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:19.080
I saw a code on the key.

2149
01:26:20.845 --> 01:26:21.678
822729.

2150
01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:26.653
It's us!

2151
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:29.770
- [Both] We're the answer.

2152
01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:31.584
- Quick. get your laptop.

2153
01:26:31.584 --> 01:26:34.584
(suspenseful music)

2154
01:26:47.948 --> 01:26:48.872
(celebratory music)

2155
01:26:48.872 --> 01:26:50.169
- [Both] We won!

2156
01:26:50.169 --> 01:26:51.178
- [Billy] Well. congratulations.

2157
01:26:51.178 --> 01:26:52.599
You solved all the clues

2158
01:26:52.599 --> 01:26:53.432
- We won.
- And found out the key

2159
01:26:53.432 --> 01:26:56.040
to solving the world's problems is you.

2160
01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.807
You will be awarded a sum total

2161
01:26:57.807 --> 01:26:59.560
of one million dollars

2162
01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:02.510
and all the Huncha Muncha
samiches you can eat.

2163
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:04.330
My assistant and I have been monitoring

2164
01:27:04.330 --> 01:27:07.130
you on closed circuit
cameras in each location.

2165
01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:09.090
and as sure as you are watchin' this.

2166
01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:11.060
we are on route to shake your hand

2167
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.410
and give you your winnings.

2168
01:27:13.296 --> 01:27:14.695
(exciting music)

2169
01:27:14.695 --> 01:27:16.026
- [Jackson] We won.

2170
01:27:16.026 --> 01:27:17.299

01:27:17.299 --> 01:27:18.659
We won.

2172
01:27:18.659 --> 01:27:19.891
We won.

2173
01:27:19.891 --> 01:27:20.724
We won.

2174
01:27:20.724 --> 01:27:21.557
We won.

2175
01:27:21.557 --> 01:27:22.390
(happy music)

2176
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:23.223
We won.

2177
01:27:23.223 --> 01:27:24.056
We won.

2178
01:27:24.056 --> 01:27:24.889
We won.

2179
01:27:25.781 --> 01:27:26.614
We won.

2180
01:27:27.448 --> 01:27:28.311
We won.

2181
01:27:28.311 --> 01:27:29.144
We did it.

2182
01:27:29.144 --> 01:27:29.977
- Jackson!
- We did it.

2183
01:27:29.977 --> 01:27:31.140
- Olivia!
- We did it.

2184
01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:35.183
You two have no idea how
much trouble you are in.

2185
01:27:36.088 --> 01:27:36.921
- [Olivia] Dad. how did you find us?

2186
01:27:36.921 --> 01:27:38.430
- Dad. why are you yelling?

2187
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:39.660
- I'm yelling?

2188
01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:41.200
Yes.

2189
01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:42.850
Because I'm furious.

2190
01:27:42.850 --> 01:27:45.550
and because I can't hear.

2191
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:48.820
Your mother and I have been riding a moped

2192
01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:50.536
all day to get here.

2193
01:27:50.536 --> 01:27:52.180
(light music)

2194
01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:55.610
You have got to stop running off

2195
01:27:55.610 --> 01:28:00.160
to scenic and historically
significant locations.

2196
01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:04.640
And letting deranged ice
cream truck men kidnap you!

2197
01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.090
- [Olivia] But. Dad. we won.

2198
01:28:06.090 --> 01:28:08.420
- It's just gonna be
a bunch of merchandise

2199
01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.400
you'll probably have a lifetime supply

2200
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.863
of Muncha Huncha Muncha T-shirts!

2201
01:28:13.994 --> 01:28:14.940
- Um.
- Any money

2202
01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:17.940
is just gonna go to taxes and fees.

2203
01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.570
- [Billy] He does have a good point there.

2204
01:28:19.570 --> 01:28:20.750
- [Brad] Thank you.

2205
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:23.410
- However. $600.000 net profit

2206
01:28:23.410 --> 01:28:25.930
is a not inconsiderable
amount of money. is it?

2207
01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:28.160
- It is to the rest of us.

2208
01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:29.240
- Wait. what?

2209
01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:34.240
- You mean you two came up here together?

2210
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:35.840
- We did. and we're going to be

2211
01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.240
doing a lot more together too.

2212
01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.550
- And these children.

2213
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:41.730
these most genius children on the planet.

2214
01:28:41.730 --> 01:28:43.060
have solved the puzzle.

2215
01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:45.270
a puzzle I designed for adults.

2216
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:46.764
I hired the top scientists.

2217
01:28:46.764 --> 01:28:50.560
the best psychologists
and the most amazing

2218
01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:51.850
middle school science teachers.

2219
01:28:51.850 --> 01:28:52.683
and they solved it.

2220
01:28:52.683 --> 01:28:54.440
- You're Billy Bob Branson!

2221
01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.063
- Oh. my God. I am!

2222
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:58.730
- My name is Brad Johnson.

2223
01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:00.640
I have applied for a number of positions

2224
01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:01.600
within your company.

2225
01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.160
I'm still shouting. aren't I?

2226
01:29:05.419 --> 01:29:08.020
- Are you the lovely progenitor

2227
01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:10.150
of these fine genius offspring?

2228
01:29:10.150 --> 01:29:10.983
- Why. yes.

2229
01:29:10.983 --> 01:29:12.440
I'm Janet Johnson.

2230
01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:13.650
- You should be so proud.

2231
01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:16.720
They are the most genius
children on the planet.

2232
01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:20.060
They have solved the puzzle
that was designed for adults.

2233
01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:22.990
I hired the top scientists.
the top psychologists

2234
01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:25.113
and the very best middle
school science teachers.

2235
01:29:25.113 --> 01:29:27.940
and these chosen children have solved it.

2236
01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:30.340
I must enroll them in
my scholarship program

2237
01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:31.860
to take care of their education.

2238
01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:34.190
And. furthermore. put them in charge

2239
01:29:34.190 --> 01:29:35.800
of my Planet Puzzler program

2240
01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:38.350
so that they can teach other children

2241
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:40.150
the kind of genius that they have released

2242
01:29:40.150 --> 01:29:42.198
upon this wonderful world.

2243
01:29:42.198 --> 01:29:44.620
- That is so amazing.

2244
01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:45.990
- I'll see to it that they are paired

2245
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:49.046
with the best possible team
of creatives to assist them.

2246
01:29:49.046 --> 01:29:49.879
- Hmm.

2247
01:29:49.879 --> 01:29:51.130
- Oh my gosh. thank you so much.

2248
01:29:51.130 --> 01:29:52.920
I don't believe it.

2249
01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:53.840
- Wait a minute!

2250
01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:58.000
Mr. Branson. I'm your number
one ice cream sandwich seller

2251
01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.152
in the whole wide world.

2252
01:29:59.152 --> 01:29:59.985
- Mm hmm.

2253
01:29:59.985 --> 01:30:01.600
- And now. these kids.

2254
01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.500
these kids are gonna take all

2255
01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.670
that treasure money away from me?

2256
01:30:05.670 --> 01:30:08.600
After all the work and
effort we put into this?

2257
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.303
Do you know how long I been
looking forward to this?

2258
01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:14.170
I mean. come on!

2259
01:30:14.170 --> 01:30:16.130
You gotta give me something for this. sir.

2260
01:30:16.130 --> 01:30:18.380
- Well. I have been
monitoring this entire contest

2261
01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:19.920
on security cameras.

2262
01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:22.250
and I can tell you that the two of you are

2263
01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:26.790
eligible for 10 to 20 years
in the state penitentiary

2264
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:29.540
if these children should
so choose to press charges.

2265
01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:31.380
- Just a moment here.

2266
01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:33.350
Do you realize how hard we worked?

2267
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:34.183
Do you?

2268
01:30:34.183 --> 01:30:36.030
- But he's the world's greatest ice cream

2269
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:37.717
salesman in the world!

2270
01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:40.760
- How are we gonna get home?

2271
01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:43.110
- How about a trip in
our corporate helicopter?

2272
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:45.270
The ride down to Boca Raton is beautiful.

2273
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:47.340
- [Olivia] Awesome. a helicopter!

2274
01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:48.589
- [Jackson] Can we get a pizza?

2275
01:30:48.589 --> 01:30:51.589
(Iceman stammering)

2276
01:30:55.743 --> 01:30:58.742
- There goes Scrooge
McMoneygills with all our money!

2277
01:30:58.742 --> 01:30:59.620
- [Iceman] Mr. Branson!

2278
01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:00.620
Mr. Branson!

2279
01:31:01.942 --> 01:31:03.534
Ugh!

2280
01:31:03.534 --> 01:31:04.440
Get outta the way.

2281
01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.960
I don't need you anymore!

2282
01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.793
You're fired!

2283
01:31:08.557 --> 01:31:11.350
- I thought we were a team.
- Don't follow me!

2284
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:16.533
(sneaky music)

2285
01:31:25.137 --> 01:31:28.054
(Chilly chuckling)

2286
01:31:29.290 --> 01:31:31.089
- [Chilly] Uh oh.

2287
01:31:31.089 --> 01:31:33.672
(cannon fires)

2288
01:31:36.215 --> 01:31:38.309
(explosion booms)

2289
01:31:38.309 --> 01:31:41.226
(Chilly chuckling)

2290
01:31:44.269 --> 01:31:47.436
(school bell ringing)

2291
01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:53.700
- All right. all right. settle down.

2292
01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:56.040
Settle down. settle down.

2293
01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:57.853
Please take your seats.

2294
01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:02.450
Welcome back from the break. all right.

2295
01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:03.800
I'm your teacher. Mr. Cook.

2296
01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.840
So over the break. I know you guys

2297
01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:06.830
had to do a report

2298
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:09.554
on this wonderful book
called "Should. Could and"

2299
01:32:09.554 --> 01:32:10.733
- [Children] And Would.

2300
01:32:10.733 --> 01:32:11.566
- That's right. so I want to hear examples

2301
01:32:11.566 --> 01:32:13.770
from you guys. and I want you to chime in.

2302
01:32:13.770 --> 01:32:14.603
Don't be afraid.

2303
01:32:14.603 --> 01:32:15.950
Does anyone have any examples

2304
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:18.100
on how you took action over the summer?

2305
01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.610
Yes. Olivia?

2306
01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:21.680
- Well. here's a story
of how we took action.

2307
01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:23.440
won a million dollars. saved our house

2308
01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:26.030
and got our dad a job!

2309
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:28.420
'Cause action. not inaction
was a lesson we were taught.

2310
01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:29.970
- [Mr. Cook] A million dollars?

2311
01:32:31.652 --> 01:32:33.450
I can't wait to hear this story.

2312
01:32:33.450 --> 01:32:36.520
- [Olivia] It all started at
the end of last school year.

2313
01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:37.800
I entered a contest.

2314
01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:40.070
and my brother and I solved the clue.

2315
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:41.460
But these evil ice cream men

2316
01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.910
stole our winning ticket.

2317
01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:45.310
And my brother and I stole it back.

2318
