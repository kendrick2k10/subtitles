9
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.680

<i>Change of shirt.</i>

17
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.400
<i>And I'm good to go for Fiji.</i>

18
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.320
And I'm going to be wearing
a pink wetsuit for the bull sharks.

19
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.160
and I used to in the early days.
and then I was asked

20
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.200
not to wear it anymore
because it made me stand out.

21
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.560
and the bull sharks noticed.

22
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.440
Well. I thought that was good.
but apparently it's not.

23
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.400
<i>I'm looking forward to it</i>
<i>because I'll be seeing a lot</i>

24

<i>of good friends.</i>

25
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.560
<i>I haven't seen them for more than a year.</i>

26
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.000
I usually get out of the water screaming
my head off with joy.

27
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.760
jumping around. "I love it. I love it."
And I do. I love it.

28
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.480
And maybe...

29
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.280
maybe I'm a bit funny...
Actually. but I do.

30
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.160
I just love going down there.

31

MALE TV HOST: <i>Now the spearfishing.</i>
<i>were you successful?</i>

33
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.560
VALERIE:<i> Well.</i>
<i>I was pretty good at it.</i>

34
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.240
<i>I was about as good as a girl can get.</i>

35
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.440
<i>One day I was down there.</i>

36
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.560
a shark came along
and frightened us out of the water.

37
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.920
It's quite exciting.

38
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.440
VALERIE:<i> They don't have hands.</i>

39
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.120
They feel with their nose
or in very few cases.

40
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.280
they feel with their teeth.

41
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.720
MALE VOICE: <i>Val has a little bump</i>
<i>on the bottom of her chin.</i>

42
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.280
<i>She said it's a shark's tooth.</i>

43
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.280
I can feel it in there. It's very painful.

44
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.840
MALE TV HOST:
<i>Valerie. thanks for coming in.</i>

45
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.200
<i>You've been telling us for so many years</i>
<i>that sharks are really nice fellows.</i>

46
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.200
Well. I haven't changed my opinion.

47
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.360
FEMALE VOICE: <i>Are you serious</i>
<i>when you compare sharks to dogs?</i>

48
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.160
VALERIE:<i> Yes.</i>
<i>because it's like any animal.</i>

49
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.160
<i>Once you get to know it</i>
<i>and understand it.</i>

50
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.920
<i>you have a different attitude</i>
<i>towards it altogether.</i>

51
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.480
<i>And there are all sorts of dogs.</i>

52
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.800
<i>And there are all sorts of sharks.</i>

53
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.560
<i>And the dangerous dogs probably bite</i>
<i>more people. and kill more people</i>

54
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.920
<i>than the dangerous sharks in the world.</i>

55
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.480
JEAN-MICHEL:<i> We know so very little</i>
<i>about what's in the ocean.</i>

56
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.680
<i>And Valerie was one of the pioneers.</i>

57
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.560
Now. of course. her name was connected
to sharks. sharks. sharks.

58
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.720
But she was doing many other things.

59
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.080
JEREMIAH: <i>Most of us were afraid of...</i>

60
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.720
Well. not afraid. but we were always
cautious and concerned

61
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.320
when we saw a bunch of sharks around.

62
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.360
With the exception of Valerie.

63
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.640
who thought that was going
to be a good time.

64
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.720
<i>People were making a lot of bold claims</i>
<i>about sharks and so on.</i>

65
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.280
<i>and how dangerous they were.</i>

66
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.640
Valerie was the only one
that I had met... (CHUCKLES)

67
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.040
...at that stage that felt

68
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.920
they weren't that dangerous.
and you could actually

69
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.840
play around with them.

70
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.440
<i>Long before anybody else.</i>

71
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.920
VALERIE:<i> The first time I ever</i>
<i>could see underwater.</i>

72
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.440
<i>I was 14 years old...</i>

73
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.680
<i>and I saw a piece of kelp.</i>

74
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.640
<i>I thought it was amazing.</i>

75
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.720
<i>It was going to and fro and to and fro.</i>

76
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.160
<i>And I knew I had to see more.</i>

77
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.680
<i>I would slide into the water...</i>

78
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.880
<i>from the world we all know...</i>

79
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.840
<i>into another world.</i>

80
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.240
<i>A different world. alien.</i>

81
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.960
<i>I was not part of that world.</i>
<i>I was just a visitor.</i>

82
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.800
<i>And I think that was the start.</i>

83
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.120
<i>My father had stomach ulcers.</i>
<i>and he found it very easy to eat fish.</i>

84
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.400
<i>And you want to please your parents</i>
<i>and I used to go out and spear him fish.</i>

85
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.440
<i>And I was very good at it.</i>

86
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.400
<i>Back in the '50s.</i>
<i>there was so much marine life.</i>

87
00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.760
<i>you learnt how to hunt.</i>

88
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.920
<i>How to stalk a fish</i>
<i>while holding your breath.</i>

89
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.640
<i>The first shark I saw...</i>

90
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.160
<i>was a grey nurse.</i>

91
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.560
<i>I was just terrified.</i>
<i>expecting to be attacked at any minute.</i>

92
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.320
<i>We got out and we were all right.</i>

93
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.920
<i>I just knew that they were killers.</i>

94
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.160
MALE REPORTER 1:<i> The main holiday hazard</i>
<i>in Britain is the weather.</i>

95
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.440
<i>but in Australia. it's sharks.</i>

96
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.520
WENDY:<i> No one wants</i>
<i>to be bitten by a monster.</i>

97
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.120
<i>When you think back</i>
<i>to the '50s and '60s. the saying was.</i>

98
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.640
"Good shark is a dead shark."

99
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.680
That was it.

100
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.760
MALE REPORTER 2:<i> Outside the harbor.</i>
<i>sharks are caught every day</i>

101
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.960
<i>by big game fishermen.</i>

102
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.360
JEREMIAH: <i>In those days. we didn't have</i>
<i>the information that we have today.</i>

103
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.680
Nature was considered
a dark. evil. you know. space.

104
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.360
something to do with the dark side.

105
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.080
VALERIE:<i> Spearfishing was nerve-racking.</i>
<i>but every single step</i>

106
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.000
<i>of the way was an adventure.</i>
<i>a step into the unknown.</i>

107
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.120
<i>And every time you did it.</i>
<i>you came out with a little more knowledge.</i>

108
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.520
<i>I understood my prey.</i>

109
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.240
<i>I eventually joined a club.</i>
<i>It was very exciting.</i>

110
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.400
<i>There were dozens of clubs through Sydney.</i>

111
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.320
<i>Spearfishing was very much</i>
<i>a macho man's sport.</i>

112
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.440
<i>When they had</i>
<i>the first lady spearfishing championships.</i>

113
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.920
<i>there were seven women.</i>

114
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.560
<i>There was about 700 men.</i>
<i>There were just so many men.</i>

115
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.480
MALE VOICE: (CHUCKLES) There we go.

116
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.520
WENDY:<i> In the '50s. diving</i>
<i>was a completely male culture.</i>

117
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.360
<i>I've talked with Valerie.</i>
<i>about what it was like</i>

118
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.080
<i>to be a woman</i>
<i>in this male-dominated culture.</i>

119
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.880
Because it was that way.
she had to be stronger and sharper.

120
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.840
<i>better than everybody. to make it.</i>

121
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.400
JEREMIAH: <i>She was quite lethal.</i>

122
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.240
<i>She would've been</i>
<i>the lady slayer back then.</i>

123
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960
JEREMIAH: And interestingly.

124
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.560
most of the great environmentalists
and conservationists.

125
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.960
they all started with hunting.

126
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.600
<i>Because they were the only ones</i>
<i>who were out. involved in these things.</i>

127
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.680
MALE REPORTER 3:<i> Valerie is responsible</i>
<i>for the boy's safety.</i>

128
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.400
<i>She will demonstrate</i>
<i>how to deal with dangerous sharks.</i>

129
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.720
<i>This dangerous shark</i>
<i>is the largest ever killed</i>

<i>by a lady skin diver</i>
<i>anywhere in the world.</i>

131
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.200
VALERIE:<i> I've only ever killed one shark.</i>

132
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.160
<i>I wish I hadn't.</i>

133
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.080
<i>But at the time. there</i>
<i>was no one to say. "This is a bad thing."</i>

134
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.880
<i>Only say. "Oh. very good."</i>

135
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.200
<i>Killed a lot of fish.</i>

136
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.720
<i>The attitude was there was</i>
<i>so much life in the ocean.</i>

137
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.120
<i>You could take what you wanted.</i>
<i>and never make a difference.</i>

138
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.080
MALE REPORTER:<i> A girl like Valerie Heighes</i>
<i>knows that once she gets ready to dive.</i>

139
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.880
<i>she must also be ready</i>
<i>to defend herself from the dangers</i>

140
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.120
<i>that are always there below the surface.</i>

141
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.080
VALERIE:<i> I think all mothers</i>
<i>wanted their daughters</i>

142
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.920
<i>to get married and have children.</i>

143
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.080
<i>It's not that I didn't want children.</i>
<i>I wanted to do other things.</i>

144
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.400
<i>I wanted to have my own special life.</i>

145
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.840
VALERIE:<i> Well. when I was 12.</i>
<i>I was diagnosed with polio.</i>

146
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.280
<i>infantile paralysis.</i>

147
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.720
VALERIE:<i> They told me until I could walk</i>
<i>I could not go home.</i>

148
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.480
<i>I hated it in there.</i>

149
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.680
<i>They started sending me books.</i>

150
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.440
<i>They sent me the great classics.</i>

151
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.200
Lorna Doone. Treasure Island.
Tom Sawyer. <i>and </i>Huckleberry Finn.

152
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.440
<i>I just loved those books.</i>
<i>I read them over and over.</i>

153
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.840
<i>I read </i>Huckleberry Finn<i> so many times.</i>
<i>It took me on a mental adventure.</i>

154
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.560
<i>I'd made up my mind I was going home.</i>

155
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.360
<i>I struggled and struggled every day.</i>

156
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.760
<i>And in nine weeks...</i>

157
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.520
I walked out
and my mother came and got me.

158
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.480
<i>They said I couldn't and I did it.</i>

159
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.240
VALERIE:<i> I'm grateful that it</i>
<i>didn't paralyze me for life.</i>

160
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:42.920
<i>I'd read those books and it made me see</i>
<i>of all the possibilities in the planet.</i>

161
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.520
<i>I didn't know how to achieve any of them.</i>
<i>but I knew they existed.</i>

162
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.120
MALE REPORTER 4:<i> But no one's anxious</i>
<i>to be slaving over a hot stove.</i>

163
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.280
<i>least of all mermaid Valerie Heighes.</i>

164
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.720
<i>Anyone who's interested in having their</i>
<i>picture taken by a mermaid.</i>

165
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.320
<i>just line up. please.</i>

166
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.320
<i>When someone like Valerie</i>
<i>comes down here with a camera.</i>

167
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.800
<i>you can bet all the best-looking fellows</i>
<i>will offer to pose for her.</i>

168
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.720
VALERIE:<i> The club used</i>
<i>to have these trips. you know.</i>

169
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.560
<i>Ron was there. I noticed him</i>
<i>because I used to see him spearfishing.</i>

170
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.240
<i>He was different from the other guys.</i>

171
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.000
VALERIE:<i> Ron had won</i>
<i>four Australian National titles.</i>

172
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.920
<i>and the World Title at this stage.</i>

173
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.720
<i>He was the best.</i>

174
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.200
<i>I was looking for adventure</i>
<i>in the underwater world.</i>

175
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.840
<i>and I used to take my 16-millimeter</i>
<i>camera out with the team of spearfishermen</i>

176
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.720
<i>that I was with in those days.</i>
<i>Just experimenting.</i>

177
00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.640
VALERIE: <i>I used to be there.</i>
<i>and he would ask me if I'd model for him.</i>

178
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.320
<i>And I was extremely flattered.</i>
<i>Of course I'd model for him!</i>

179
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.160
RON: <i>I clearly remember the first time</i>
<i>that I filmed Valerie underwater.</i>

180
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.080
<i>I was very interested in Valerie</i>
<i>because she was very attractive.</i>

181
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.240
VALERIE:<i> I had fun.</i>
<i>Just flirting away. I guess.</i>

182
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.600
<i>I made my own bikinis.</i>

183
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.320
<i>And then one day. Ron said.</i>
<i>"I'm going to buy you a bathing costume."</i>

184
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.680
<i>It was yellow.</i>

185
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.880
RON: <i>She was interested</i>
<i>in the underwater world like I was.</i>

186
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.760
<i>She was aggressive.</i>
<i>she wasn't one of these wimpish women.</i>

187
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.400
VALERIE:<i> And then we decided</i>
<i>to get married.</i>

188
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.440
<i>I was the woman spearfishing champion.</i>

189
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.560
<i>Ron was the world spearfishing champion.</i>

190
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.320
<i>We were at the top of the trade.</i>

191
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:36.520
<i>Ron and I discovered spearing a fish</i>
<i>often attracted sharks.</i>

192
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.320
RODNEY: <i>During that period of time.</i>
<i>divers were dragging</i>

193
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.680
<i>four or five fish through the water.</i>

194
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.440
And of course we know now that
if you want to attract sharks

195
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.040
you get fish blood.
and you drag it through the water.

196
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.880
and so we were just bringing bait
basically for a shark.

197
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.240
VALERIE:<i> We heard about</i>
<i>Rodney's shark attack with horror.</i>

198
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.640
<i>He was a friend!</i>

199
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.320
RODNEY: <i>There was 485 stitches</i>
<i>in my chest.</i>

200
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.480
and 94 in my hand here.

201
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.520
and every tendon
except this one was broken.

202
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.280
They had to stitch them back again.

203
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.960
MALE REPORTER: Do you hope
to continue skin diving one day?

204
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.760
Oh. I'll get in the water somewhere.
sometime. but I don't know.

205
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.320
VALERIE: <i>We knew it was</i>
<i>a great white shark that bit him.</i>

206
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.480
<i>We were excited about the possibility</i>
<i>of getting footage of this beast.</i>

207
00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.760
<i>Rodney had the idea of doing</i>
<i>a great white shark trip.</i>

208
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.920
<i>Of course I wanted</i>
<i>to go at the time. but I couldn't go.</i>

209
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.400
The owner and captain
did not want a woman on board.

210
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.560
RON: <i>Rodney arranged</i>
<i>an expedition with Alf Dean.</i>

211
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.480
<i>Alf Dean held the world record</i>
<i>for big game fishing</i>

212
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.560
<i>for great white sharks.</i>

213
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.240
DOUGLAS: <i>At the time. other people</i>
<i>had photographed other sharks.</i>

214
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.440
But there were no images
of great white sharks alive. underwater.

215
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.600
RON:<i> I'd never. ever seen it before</i>
<i>on other people's documentaries.</i>

216
00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.840
<i>so I could see the potential.</i>

217
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.560
RODNEY:<i> After a couple of days</i>
<i>we pulled up at Memory Cove and Alf said.</i>

218
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.640
"I've caught and seen
quite a few sharks here."

219
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.600
<i>So. he started his whale oil drip.</i>

220
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.440
<i>We got up in the morning.</i>
<i>and saw great. big sharks.</i>

221
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.960
DOUGLAS:<i> The very first time I saw it.</i>
<i>the hair stood up on the back of my neck</i>

222
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.800
<i>because it was such a big shark.</i>

223
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.080
DOUGLAS:<i> Holy cow!</i>
<i>That's a mean-looking shark.</i>

224
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.440
RODNEY: <i>Ron actually sat on the duckboard</i>
<i>at the back. filming some footage...</i>

225
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.400
and saw submarines with teeth.

226
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.000
RON:<i> I thought this was</i>
<i>a very impressive animal.</i>

227
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.000
<i>I thought I had something unique there.</i>

228
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.960
VALERIE:<i> It's like liking a lion. I guess.</i>

229
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.320
<i>It's a special beast.</i>

230
00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.600
<i>After that. I hate to say it.</i>
<i>it was just kill. kill. kill.</i>

231
00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.360
RODNEY: <i>On that trip.</i>
<i>Alf thought it was his duty</i>

232
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.400
<i>to catch and kill as many sharks</i>
<i>as he could. and we ended up on the boat.</i>

233
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.240
five ten-to fourteen-foot
great white sharks spread out.

234
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.480
<i>And that was actually the first time</i>
<i>I started to realize</i>

235
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.440
we've got these great big.
incredible animals.

236
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.600
just killed and lost forever.

237
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.440
VALERIE:<i> I thought it was sad.</i>

238
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.520
<i>Really changed the way I looked</i>
<i>at the world and spearfishing.</i>

239
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.160
<i>After that. Ron said.</i>
<i>"Actually. killing fish upsets me.</i>

240
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.440
<i>"I'm not doing this anymore."</i>

241
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:20.360
<i>We put our spears down.</i>
<i>and never did another competition again.</i>

242
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.160
<i>We said. "From now on.</i>
<i>I'm shooting them with my camera."</i>

243
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.560
SYLVIA: <i>It was a personal revelation</i>
<i>that made that transition.</i>

244
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.360
<i>experience that convinced them.</i>

245
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.920
It wasn't somebody telling them.
they could see for themselves.

246
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.400
And I admire that.

247
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.440
VALERIE: <i>We were selling more</i>
<i>and more footage for television.</i>

248
00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.000
<i>They wouldn't just buy</i>
<i>any underwater film...</i>

249
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.280
<i>they wanted dangerous marine animals.</i>
<i>Or what they thought were dangerous.</i>

250
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.800
<i>They wanted drama.</i>

251
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.640
<i>And if I could be in the film</i>
<i>fluttering around</i>

252
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.440
<i>amongst all these creatures.</i>

253
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.400
<i>that was even better.</i>

254
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.840
Valerie would go down
and just pick up anything

255
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.040
and bring it up and play with it
and just... It was remarkable.

256
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.760
<i>Here's this beautiful Australian gal</i>
<i>doing all these crazy things</i>

257
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.840
<i>that nobody's supposed to be able to do.</i>

258
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.400
VALERIE:<i> Ron often asked me to do</i>
<i>very dangerous things.</i>

259
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.840
<i>He used to call me sometimes</i>
<i>"Give-it-a-go-Valerie."</i>

260
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.080
<i>whether I was cooking a new food or...</i>

261
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.960
<i>diving with sharks.</i> (CHUCKLES)

262
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.680
<i>I wouldn't say I thought</i>
<i>I was a Bond girl.</i>

263
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.000
<i>Everything thing I did was to make money.</i>

264
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.960
<i>Ron was always wanting</i>
<i>new camera equipment.</i>

265
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.640
<i>He made all his own housings.</i>

266
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.680
<i>He was a genius.</i>

267
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.120
<i>I'd say the cleverest man I've ever met.</i>

268
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.360
<i>We did whatever we could</i>
<i>to make a living</i>

269
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.120
<i>out of what we loved to do.</i>

270
00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.840
Do you want me to feed
those little tiny fish.

271
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.920
or do you want me
to save it up for the big trout?

272
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.680
There's not many of those
little fish around.

273
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.360
We'll look for the tiny yellow shells
in the dendrophilia.

274
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.320
DOUGLAS:<i> Back in the 1960s.</i>

275
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.960
<i>there were a handful of people</i>
<i>in the world</i>

276
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.520
<i>that were shooting film underwater.</i>
<i>There was Hans Hass in Germany.</i>

277
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.480
<i>There was Stan Waterman</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>

278
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.200
<i>There was Cousteau in the South of France.</i>

279
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.280
VALERIE:<i> We saw Jacques Cousteau</i>
<i>on television.</i>

280
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.760
<i>He had a lot of money</i>
<i>from the French government...</i>

281
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.640
<i>and he had a lot of people to help him.</i>

282
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.440
<i>Whereas. we didn't have any of that.</i>

283
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.280
<i>One thing we did copy a little bit</i>
<i>from Captain Jacques.</i>

284
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.480
<i>he always wore a red beret.</i>

285
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.520
<i>So. I always wore a bright hair ribbon.</i>

286
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.680
<i>That was my trademark.</i>

287
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.520
JEREMIAH:<i> The Taylors were out there</i>
<i>doing their thing.</i>

288
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.920
<i>They were owning and exploring. you know.</i>
<i>the marine environment by themselves.</i>

289
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.560
<i>I mean. it was just Ron and Valerie.</i>

290
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.480
<i>This was the golden age</i>
<i>of new underwater information.</i>

291
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.320
VALERIE: <i>Very little was known</i>
<i>around the world about sharks</i>

292
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.480
<i>in those days.</i>

293
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.600
<i>You can watch it</i>
<i>from the boat all you want.</i>

294
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.160
You can cut it up
and study everything about it.

295
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.480
It was like. "Oh. it will do this."
And be a great scientist.

296
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.720
<i>But you still haven't seen it</i>
<i>underwater in action.</i>

297
00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.520
<i>The first great white shark I saw</i>

298
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.360
<i>was like a freight train</i>
<i>coming out of the mist.</i>

299
00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.440
VALERIE:<i> It was magnificent.</i>

300
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.120
<i>After that. I never missed a trip</i>
<i>to go out and see sharks.</i>

301
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.400
<i>I found them very exciting</i>

302
00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.880
<i>and this little tin boat</i>

303
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.880
is sort of freedom
when you get on the ocean.

304
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.240
<i>The whole world is yours.</i>

305
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.320
<i>We were both always thinking of ways</i>
<i>to find an area where there's good sharks.</i>

306
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.320
<i>Marion Reef is in the middle</i>
<i>of the Coral Sea.</i>

307
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.000
<i>A fisherman knew about it.</i>

308
00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.240
<i>And he said.</i>
<i>"There's a lot of sharks out there."</i>

309
00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:01.160
<i>So we baited up and we realized</i>
<i>this was a good spot to film.</i>

310
00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.680
VALERIE: <i>So we got to know them better</i>
<i>than most other animals.</i>

311
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.200
<i>Next year we went back.</i>

312
00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.160
<i>and before we even dropped anchor.</i>

313
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.920
<i>the sharks came up to our tinny.</i>

314
00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.800
<i>They knew the sound of our boat.</i>

315
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.160
<i>They knew there'd be food.</i>
<i>and we realized a shark can learn.</i>

316
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.800
And you can teach one a very simple trick
very quickly if you want to.

317
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.880
<i>I knew what would make a good image.</i>
<i>I was a photographer.</i>

318
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:30.200
<i>There was a nice pink coral and I knew</i>
<i>where the sun was going to set.</i>

319
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.200
<i>I started waving a bit of food around</i>
<i>in front of the coral</i>

320
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.560
<i>and a whitetip came in straight away.</i>
<i>and I bopped him on the nose.</i>

321
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.760
<i>and wouldn't give it to him.</i>

322
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.640
Eventually. he came over to the pink coral
and I gave him the food.

323
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.960
I did that twice and he knew
if he swam over to the pink coral.

324
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.800
in a certain direction. he'd get a piece
of food. just a small piece of fish.

325
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.880
<i>And it worked. It worked.</i>

326
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.000
<i>The shot was exactly what I had planned.</i>

327
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.120
They learn.
Faster than you can teach a dog.

328
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:20.680
JEAN-MICHEL: (CHUCKLES) <i>She had</i>
<i>the courage to face up to a species</i>

329
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:26.080
which we didn't know very much about
in those days. connecting with nature.

330
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.040
and she was able to share her experience.

331
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.600
and adventures with the public.

332
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.200
<i>She helped everybody. including us.</i>

333
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.400
<i>because she would show us</i>
<i>what she was doing.</i>

334
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.120
<i>when historically</i>
<i>we were staying away from them.</i>

335
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.880
<i>Well. she didn't.</i>

336
00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.480
<i>She was the one getting close to it.</i>

337
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.800
and she would follow it
and she was fascinated

338
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.480
to learn not just about the way it looks.
but the behavior of that fish.

339
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.680
VALERIE:<i> And then we got</i>
<i>our very big chance.</i>

340
00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.600
Blue Water. White Death <i>was a film.</i>

341
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.320
<i>was dreamt up</i>
<i>by Peter Gimbel. an American.</i>

342
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.840
<i>And he had a fascination with sharks.</i>

343
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.640
<i>And he wanted to make a feature film.</i>

344
00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.200
<i>Peter had seen two</i>
<i>of Ron's documentaries</i>

345
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.920
<i>and he knew we could work with sharks.</i>

346
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.720
We're looking for the animal
that I think is considered to be

347
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.520
the most dangerous predator
still living in the world.

348
00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:02.000
VALERIE:<i> Peter Gimbel had us along</i>
<i>to guarantee someone there</i>

349
00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.280
<i>who knew how to handle these beasts.</i>

350
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.440
<i>And he gave us. Ron and I.</i>
<i>the adventure of our lives.</i>

351
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:24.000
<i>We set off in search</i>
<i>out of South Africa...</i>

352
00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.720
<i>and we followed the whaling fleet</i>

353
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.240
<i>because they told us that huge</i>
<i>great white sharks came in</i>

354
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.160
<i>to feed on the harpooned whales.</i>

355
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.080
STAN: How far ahead of us
are the other ships now?

356
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.240
Oh. now about...

357
00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:46.000
As an underwater shooter.
I just saw in it a wonderful adventure.

358
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.560
A search taking us to the Indian Ocean.

359
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.640
<i>searching for the great white shark.</i>

360
00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:59.920
I think that Peter. and Ron. and myself.
and Valerie gradually found our courses

361
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.120
narrowing down onto sharks.

362
00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.560
This charisma that they have.

363
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.560
JAYNE: Blue Water. White Death
<i>was probably the first</i>

364
00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:14.240
<i>of its type ever made.</i>

365
00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.880
And to have a female in there.

366
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.800
and a pretty blonde female in it
with all those males.

367
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.880
Well. you're gonna use
the far cylinder first.

368
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.200
We turn this one off and this one on.

369
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.240
-so I...
-Yeah.

370
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.280
JAYNE:<i> She had to earn</i>
<i>her way on that boat.</i>

371
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.360
I've got both.

372
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.400
-Which camera's going. Ron?
-This one here.

373
00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.240
MALE VOICE: There's a shark
right under the bow!

374
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.320
RON: Hold it. there.
there's the other one.

375
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.520
There's another one! There's another one.
There are four down here now.

376
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.920
Four sharks. Now I've lost the other.

377
00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.840
-MALE VOICE: There you go.
-It's like trying to count chickens.

378
00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.320
GIMBEL:<i> With this amount of food</i>
<i>in the water. we expect the great white...</i>

379
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.360
<i>but he doesn't come.</i>

380
00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.000
VALERIE: <i>But other sharks came up</i>
<i>from the great depths.</i>

381
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.760
<i>We never saw the bottom.</i>
<i>there was no land.</i>

382
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:10.000
<i>We'd never encountered</i>
<i>oceanic whitetips before.</i>

383
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.720
<i>The species of shark responsible</i>
<i>for more human deaths</i>

384
00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.840
<i>than all the other sharks</i>
<i>in the world put together.</i>

385
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.680
STAN:<i> The idea of getting</i>
<i>into the water. outside of the cage</i>

386
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:36.480
in the middle of all of those sharks
and everything was pretty mind-blowing.

387
00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.480
but we thought we might get away with it.

388
00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.400
VALERIE:<i> When it was decided</i>
<i>that we would leave the cage. I thought.</i>

389
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.240
<i>"Yeah. we'll die. Now we die."</i>

390
00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.720
Never for a second
did I think of not going.

391
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.200
<i>Carcharhinus longimanus. he's the one</i>

392
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:38.640
<i>that will take 200 people in the water</i>
<i>after a ship sinks. They come in packs.</i>

393
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.320
<i>We had noticed</i>
<i>that before they bit the whale.</i>

394
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.720
<i>even though it was dead.</i>

395
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.720
<i>the shark would bump it</i>
<i>two or three times. then bite it.</i>

396
00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.920
<i>And we figured that the shark</i>
<i>would bump us before it bit.</i>

397
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.040
<i>and if we bumped them back hard</i>

398
00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.880
<i>we could make ourselves</i>
<i>a place in the pack.</i>

399
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.920
<i>The cameramen.</i>
<i>they all had these giant housings</i>

400
00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.840
<i>made out of metal.</i>

401
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.560
<i>I had a stick.</i>

402
00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.000
<i>We went into another world.</i>

403
00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.520
<i>A world that existed 20 million years ago.</i>

404
00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.400
<i>We were accepted as other marine animals</i>
<i>come to feed on the whale...</i>

405
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.720
<i>but only after we had made a place</i>
<i>for ourselves with the pack.</i>

406
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.480
It seemed. to some...

407
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.040
just plain foolhardy.
what they were doing.

408
00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.600
<i>But what they did in the end</i>
<i>was to provide the evidence</i>

409
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.080
<i>that if we mind our business.</i>
<i>they mind theirs.</i>

410
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.320
<i>It's mutual respect.</i>

411
00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.080
You wouldn't believe!
You couldn't believe!

412
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.240
It was fantastic!

413
00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.400
Everything happened!

414
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.440
They hit the whale
and blood went everywhere.

415
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:47.440
and Stan and Peter were miles away.
they were just surrounded by sharks.

416
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.480
and look. there must've been
a dozen sharks.

417
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.480
charging in on them all at once. and then

418
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.480
as Peter said. he just kept his finger
on the button and spun in circles.

419
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.600
that's all he could do.

420
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.760
Well. certainly they were exhilarated
when they came up from those dives

421
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.040
because they didn't know
that they could survive it.

422
00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.200
<i>In those days.</i>
<i>people didn't dive with sharks.</i>

423
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.720
<i>But. when you look at those images...</i>

424
00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.320
<i>a hundred huge oceanic whitetip sharks.</i>

425
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.280
<i>that can't happen today.</i>

426
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.320
<i>There aren't enough sharks.</i>

427
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.920
<i>And those images. I think.</i>
<i>represent a historical record</i>

428
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.600
of what there was at one time.
and that's incredibly valuable.

429
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.920
VALERIE:<i> We were still looking</i>
<i>for the great white shark.</i>

430
00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.280
PETER: I'm sorry and I won't...
I'm not going to accept these predictions.

431
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.320
I still think we can attract
a great white shark to this rig.

432
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.600
VALERIE:<i> Ron and I tried</i>
<i>to tell him where to go?</i>

433
00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.880
<i>We knew we were in the wrong place.</i>

434
00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.840
Hello. darling. Hello. sweetie. Come on.

435
00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.320
<i>Eventually. Peter did listen.</i>

436
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.480
<i>We all went to South Australia.</i>

437
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.600
MALE VOICE 1: Here he comes in now!
There it is! The great white!

438
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.200
-MALE VOICE 2: Oh. he's gotta be 12.
-PETER: Oh. yeah.

439
00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.840
PETER: That is a great white!

440
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.160
STAN:<i> The public loves. of course. danger.</i>

441
00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.840
Yeah. I said you'd get it.
I knew you'd get it.

442
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.160
STAN: <i>Add to that a beautiful woman.</i>

443
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.680
You have a successful documentary
in the makeup of it.

444
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.880
MALE VOICE 1: Tear it up! Hey! Hey!

445
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
VALERIE:<i> I really didn't realize</i>
<i>what a big film it was going to be.</i>

446
00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.880
MALE VOICE 2: Here he comes now. right up!

447
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.720
I bet Gimbel's elated with joy in there!

448
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.600
MALE VOICE: <i>Right up towards the cage!</i>

449
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.040
CARL:<i> There was a genius</i>
<i>in the making of the movie.</i>

450
00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:14.240
Valerie set the standard
by being the first glamourous female

451
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:18.360
<i>to go out and have</i>
<i>these dangerous adventures.</i>

452
00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.800
<i>and I was hooked.</i>

453
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.720
Get back in. Ron! Silly fool.

454
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.320
I don't know what he's doing
out of the cage.

455
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.080
-There. look at him!
-MALE VOICE: Where is he? Where is he?

456
00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.200
VALERIE: Sitting on top of the cage.

457
00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.520
JAYNE:<i> I'm from a little village in Wales.</i>
<i>and our local policeman.</i>

458
00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.440
he had posters of her up
on his wall as a child. (CHUCKLES)

459
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.160
<i>It's worldwide!</i>
<i>She was really. really out there.</i>

460
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.480
MALE VOICE: Get in. Valerie.
Get your hands inside that cage.

461
00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:49.520
Valerie in <i>Blue Water. White Death.</i>
she was a revelation to me.

462
00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.120
<i>She was strong.</i>

463
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.320
VALERIE: <i>There were no divers anywhere</i>
<i>who hadn't seen </i>Blue Water. White Death.

464
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.240
<i>And among them was a diver</i>
<i>called Peter Benchley.</i>

465
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.040
WENDY:<i> Valerie and Ron</i>
<i>were definitely Peter's idols.</i>

466
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.840
<i>He was aware of the excitement of sharks.</i>

467
00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.000
Peter had an idea
for a novel about a fish.

468
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.080
and I said. "Peter. I just don't think
that's gonna work."

469
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.000
RON:<i> Universal Pictures got us a book</i>
<i>from Peter Benchley called </i>Jaws.

470
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.560
VALERIE:<i> They sent us the galley proofs</i>
<i>and a letter saying.</i>

471
00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.800
<i>"Do you think this story</i>
<i>would make a good feature film?"</i>

472
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.480
We both read it
and Ron wrote back and said. "Yes."

473
00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.600
Please help me! Help!

474
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.360
Now this is not a boat accident.
and it wasn't Jack the Ripper.

475
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.760
(SIGHS) It was a shark.

476
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.480
VALERIE: Jaws <i>was our first big</i>
<i>Hollywood deal.</i>

477
00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.480
<i>Ron said. "I've got to do a good job here.</i>
<i>it could be important."</i>

478
00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.440
<i>They had already decided</i>
<i>that Steven Spielberg</i>

479
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.320
<i>was going to be the director.</i>

480
00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:15.120
<i>He said. "Get the live</i>
<i>white shark footage first."</i>

481
00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.520
VALERIE: <i>We had done this sort</i>
<i>of thing so often.</i>

482
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.960
<i>going out and trying to get</i>
<i>a performance out of a shark.</i>

483
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.480
I was pretty proud to get a call asking me
if I could organize a major expedition.

484
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.760
And at that time quite young
and I was pretty excited.

485
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:06.640
Peter postulated in <i>Jaws</i> that the shark
was a big one. a 16-footer.

486
00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.760
<i>And. of course. Spielberg decided</i>
<i>to make it into a 25-foot shark.</i>

487
00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:24.720
<i>And this caused a lot of toing and froing</i>
<i>between Universal and Ron.</i>

488
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.320
<i>backwards and forwards.</i>

489
00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.960
<i>Steven Spielberg was very young.</i>

490
00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:36.880
<i>It was his second major film.</i>
<i>He looked. to me. like a teenager.</i>

491
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.080
RON:<i> I said. "Steven.</i>
<i>there is a problem here.</i>

492
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.400
<i>"Our white sharks</i>
<i>are only about 13-feet long."</i>

493
00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:52.880
<i>He said. "No problem. We'll send down</i>
<i>a half-size man and half-size cages."</i>

494
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:59.080
VALERIE:<i> Everything we filmed</i>
<i>was half-size</i>

495
00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.680
<i>to make our sharks look bigger.</i>

496
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.360
RODNEY: Skippy<i> was</i>
<i>my abalone dive boat.</i>

497
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:14.160
<i>We used my little boat as the stand-in</i>
<i>for the boat in the </i>Jaws<i> movie.</i>

498
00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.560
You're gonna need a bigger boat.

499
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:30.320
VALERIE: <i>They sent out this little man</i>
<i>called Carl Rizzo.</i>

500
00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.200
<i>He was a half-sized man. perfectly formed.</i>

501
00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:38.200
RODNEY:<i> Who used to actually be</i>
<i>a stand-in for children</i>

502
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.360
<i>on horseback riding and stuff.</i>

503
00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:45.560
<i>The little guy comes up to me.</i>
<i>and he says to me.</i>

504
00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.200
"When they pump oxygen into you.

505
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.880
"do you have to suck it in
or is it pushed in?"

506
00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.760
Which. I knew straight away.
he had no idea how to dive.

507
00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.520
VALERIE:<i> He was allergic to the sun.</i>
<i>he was allergic to salt water.</i>

508
00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.080
<i>and he was very allergic to sharks.</i>

509
00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.000
<i>And I remember</i>
<i>when he saw his first great white.</i>

510
00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.200
<i>he was very nervous.</i>

511
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.000
<i>He looked at this big thing</i>
<i>swimming out behind the boat.</i>

512
00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:27.720
<i>and he said. "I should've asked</i>
<i>for more money."</i>

513
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.160
SHAW: <i>If I can get him close enough</i>
<i>to this cage.</i>

514
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.000
-I think I can get him in the mouth...
-That shark will rip that cage to pieces!

515
00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.680
You got any better suggestions?

516
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.640
RODNEY:<i> I'm in the small</i>
<i>half-size boat looking after him.</i>

517
00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.360
<i>and I wound him down in the winch.</i>

518
00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:56.200
<i>When Carl saw those great white sharks</i>
<i>swimming around. he was terrified.</i>

519
00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.680
<i>The director yelled out.</i>
<i>"Quick. pull up Carl.</i>

520
00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.040
<i>He's drowning. he's drowning!"</i>

521
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.480
<i>So. I wound him to the top.</i>
<i>and I was saying.</i>

522
00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.120
<i>"What's the matter? What's the matter?"</i>

523
00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:19.400
And he said. "My mask.
My mask. it was filling up with water."

524
00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.240
VALERIE:<i> It was his reluctance</i>
<i>that saved his life.</i>

525
00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.080
RODNEY:<i> I was about ten meters down.</i>
<i>filming up.</i>

526
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:39.680
<i>There's a shark there and I'm thinking.</i>
<i>"Why isn't Carl getting in the cage?"</i>

527
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.440
VALERIE:<i> Rodney was about</i>
<i>to pick him up and pop him in.</i>

528
00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.360
<i>And the shark came in.</i>
<i>and it bumped into the cage.</i>

529
00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.160
<i>and got its head stuck in the bridle.</i>

530
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.640
MARTIN: Pull him up. Pull it!

531
00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.560
VALERIE:<i> And I picked up</i>
<i>the 16-millimeter camera.</i>

532
00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.800
<i>and I shot it on film.</i>

533
00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.960
When we were shooting
the Australian sequences

534
00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.720
of the great white sharks.

535
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.520
One of the great white sharks
jumped into the cage boat.

536
00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.200
<i>There was a horrible cracking sound.</i>
<i>the bit of the decking</i>

537
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.560
<i>where the winch was attached</i>
<i>to the boat broke off.</i>

538
00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:36.760
MALE VOICE: It's getting away!

539
00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.600
VALERIE:<i> I saw Rodney pull Carl back.</i>

540
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.240
The shark grabbed between its jaws.

grabbed and twisted the cage.

542
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.760
and then sounded with the cage.

543
00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.840
RODNEY: <i>And everything broke off</i>
<i>and came tumbling down past me.</i>

544
00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.920
VALERIE:<i> The shark got out</i>
<i>of it and swam away.</i>

545
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.240
<i>We had what we call a good performer.</i>

546
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:12.960
<i>It wasn't in the script...</i>

547
00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:18.240
<i>but they put it in because it was good.</i>

548
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.480
Well. how'd you get sharks to do that?

549
00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.000
How did they get a shark to do
all those things on cue?

550
00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.840
VALERIE: Well. we better not
tell her the secret.

551
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.720
Well you have to...
You put them in training

552
00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.880
-at least three weeks before the film.
-VALERIE: Yes. training.

"You go diving in the ocean?
It's full of sharks!"

577
00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:10.480

I was very devastated because I said.

"Nobody's gonna want to go in the ocean."

<i>You don't walk around New York</i>

VALERIE:<i> But</i> Jaws<i> did...</i>
<i>It did set things back.</i>

590
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.320
<i>The thing that I regret is that people</i>
<i>went out and killed sharks everywhere.</i>

"And sharks are being killed left
and right. and we are worried

599
00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:59.360
"that there may be actually
an endangerment of some of the species."

600
00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.480
VALERIE:<i> Peter Benchley said</i>
<i>he'd have never written the book</i>

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:08.760
<i>if he had known what</i>
<i>the aftermath would have been.</i>

602
00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.920
HOST:<i> People who saw the movie </i>Jaws
<i>are afraid of sharks.</i>

603
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.560
Have we reason to be afraid of them?

604
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.160
You should treat them with caution.

605
00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.720
but you don't go around
being afraid of motor cars.

606
00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:25.560
Universal took Ron and I to America.
and we toured the States.

607
00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.640
doing every talk show. telling people

608
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.520
<i>that sharks were not like</i>
<i>the shark in </i>Jaws.

609
00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:36.560
RON: <i>But there's an interesting point</i>
<i>that not all sharks are dangerous.</i>

610
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:40.360
You say that sharks are not dangerous.
and yet both of you took part

611
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.760
in two movies that portray sharks
as being very dangerous.

612
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.560
How do you justify something like that?

613
00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:49.120
We have been criticized
for promoting sharks

614
00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.840
as being man-eaters and dangerous.

615
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.120
But<i> Jaws</i> is actually a fictional film.
but it's such a realistic film

616
00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.920
that people tend to believe
sharks are dangerous.

617
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.360
I don't think that people
should stay off the beaches

618
00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.720
because they're afraid
of being attacked by a shark.

619
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:06.280
They're much more likely to fall over
and break a leg on the way to the beach

620
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.520
than they are of being attacked
once they're in the water.

621
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.400
Ron. Valerie Taylor. thank you very much.
We'll be right back after this message.

Take the whole jaw out. teeth fall out.
you put 'em on a gold chain

623
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.760
and then go to the movie and see <i>Jaws.</i>
everybody thinks you're the best.

624
00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.480
VALERIE:<i> I feel if there's a shark</i>
<i>in the area</i>

625
00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.760
<i>and the swimmer stays relatively calm.</i>

626

there's a very good chance
the shark will look at him. say.

627
00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.720
"Well. I don't want that." and go away.

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:37.880
Most sharks just let go.
They test with their teeth.

632
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.040
FEMALE VOICE: <i>We have the fresh teeth</i>
<i>that have been pulled out</i>

633
00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.000
<i>of a shark recently.</i>

634
00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.880
MALE VOICE 1:<i> We ran out of shark's teeth.</i>
<i>out of shark's jaws.</i>

635
00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.160
MALE VOICE 2:<i> It's just a killing machine.</i>

636
00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:47.120
It's more dangerous to have
a backyard pool. Did you know that?

637
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.680
MALE VOICE:<i> Just wish we had</i>
<i>more of it to sell.</i>

638
00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.760
FEMALE VOICE:<i> I find them</i>
<i>very frightening. as a matter of fact.</i>

639
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.520
They didn't listen to me.
Frankly. they didn't care.

640
00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.200
<i>The killing still went on.</i>

641
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.040
Yes. what. what?
Oh. well. that's it. isn't it?

642
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.000
What about you? What are you up to?

643
00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.640
Jaws<i> gave all sharks a bad name.</i>

644
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:33.720
<i>You know. there are over 400 species</i>
<i>of shark in the ocean.</i>

645
00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.760
-Come on.
<i>-Maybe five or six</i>

646
00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:39.440
<i>are potentially dangerous.</i>

647
00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:50.040
<i>Most sharks are totally harmless.</i>
<i>like the grey nurse shark.</i>

648
00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.200
DOUGLAS:<i> Here you have a grey nurse shark</i>
<i>that looks like this fierce animal.</i>

649
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.360
Because their teeth
are hanging out of their face.

650
00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.680
people think.
"We've gotta kill that shark."

651
00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.840
<i>I mean. they were completely exterminated</i>
<i>off the coast of Florida.</i>

652
00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:10.680
<i>And that same thing</i>
<i>could've happened in Australia.</i>

653
00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:17.240
<i>They were being slaughtered.</i>

654
00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:20.560
<i>So I started writing letters.</i>

655
00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.880
<i>And I pleaded with the politicians.</i>

656
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:27.960
<i>And I wanted the grey nurse</i>
<i>to be totally protected.</i>

657
00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:33.960
<i>As a spearo. I had killed</i>
<i>one grey nurse...</i>

658
00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:39.800
<i>and now I wanted to save them.</i>

659
00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.760
<i>I needed to save them.</i>

660
00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:56.400
<i>Once I get my teeth stuck</i>
<i>into an idea. I don't let go.</i>

661
00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:01.920
<i>There's nothing like having a good piece</i>
<i>of underwater film</i>

662
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.560
<i>and saying.</i>
<i>"See. it's harmless. It's like a dog."</i>

663
00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.440
<i>I kept at them. and at them. and at them.</i>

664
00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:23.240
<i>It worked. It's now legally protected.</i>

665
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:30.000
<i>You know. it was the first shark</i>
<i>in the world to be protected.</i>

666
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.640
JEREMIAH:<i> Valerie led the way.</i>

667
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.080
A huge piece of what conservation
has become today

668
00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:48.120
all began. you know. with those
little grey nurse sharks.

669
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:56.880
CARL:<i> Valerie tried to explain</i>
<i>and soften the ignorance</i>

670
00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.720
to create an audience of...

671
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.120
shark lovers.

672
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.760
<i>There was that occasion where they</i>
<i>actually had a shark</i>

673
01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.560
<i>that was tangled in a wire</i>
<i>and they cut it loose.</i>

674
01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.640
VALERIE:<i> When you see a great white</i>
<i>struggling for life. you want to save it.</i>

675
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.760
CARL:<i> Towing a shark tail first</i>
<i>is something you or I might hesitate.</i>

676
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.240
<i>They did not hesitate.</i>

677
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.240
<i>Yes. there was risk. they put that aside.</i>
<i>They instinctively helped the animal.</i>

678
01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.320
VALERIE: <i>Pretty dangerous thing to do.</i>

679
01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.040
<i>But that shark knew exactly</i>
<i>what we were doing.</i>

680
01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:22.040
CARL:<i> Wow. not a sign of aggression.</i>
<i>Remarkable moment.</i>

681
01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.080
VALERIE:<i> It swam out to sea...</i>

682
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.960
<i>and was caught</i>
<i>by a fisherman five months later.</i>

683
01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.880
Conservation?
There is no such thing on killer sharks.

684
01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.400
because the general public
realizes they're killer sharks

685
01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.600
and that's all there is to it.

686
01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.520
VALERIE:<i> Great white sharks</i>
<i>are in big trouble.</i>

687
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.520
<i>They're a very big animal.</i>
<i>they live a long time.</i>

688
01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.040
<i>and they breed very slowly.</i>

689
01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.040
<i>I have a file that must be</i>
<i>half an inch thick of letters I've written</i>

690
01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.560
<i>to have the great white shark</i>
<i>protected before it's too late.</i>

691
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.520
You know what they're doing?
They're actually feeding that garbage

692
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.600
to the government.

693
01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.920
<i>Telling them that they're</i>
<i>an endangered species and all that.</i>

694
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.280
<i>They ought to be in jail.</i>

695
01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.760
VALERIE: <i>The only sharks he knows.</i>
<i>the only sharks he works with.</i>

696
01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:29.000
and he does it from the safety
of the back of his boat I might add.

697
01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.240
are sharks that are fighting to survive.

698
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.960
Those sharks he catches
are trying to escape.

699
01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.400
They want to live. just as you
or I would try to escape.

700
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.800
and want to live if someone
hooked us in the mouth.

701

MALE VOICE 1:<i> This is the stuff</i>
<i>nightmares are made of.</i>

702
01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.640
MALE VOICE 2:<i> Shark. The very word</i>

703
01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.400
<i>is enough to scare most people</i>
<i>out of their wits.</i>

704
01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.440
MALE VOICE 3:<i> Great white sharks</i>
<i>have no peer when it comes to terror.</i>

705
01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:56.280
VALERIE:<i> Anti-conservationists</i>
<i>call sharks "God's mistakes."</i>

706
01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.120
<i>It's just a heap of rubbish.</i>

707
01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.760
<i>They have been around unchanged</i>
<i>for millions of years.</i>

708
01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.600
<i>That's not a mistake.</i>

709
01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.600
RON:<i> Twenty-four hours a day.</i>
<i>they're on the prowl.</i>

710
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.760
VALERIE: <i>I don't really think that a shark</i>
<i>swims around saying.</i>

711
01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.240
<i>"A-ha! There's a human.</i>
<i>I must swim up and eat him."</i>

712
01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.520
<i>They don't think like that.</i>

713
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.520
RON:<i> There's gonna be a major problem.</i>

714
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.080
VALERIE: <i>Ron and I decided</i>
<i>to prove to the general public</i>

715
01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.080
<i>that sharks were not out to get us.</i>

716
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:38.680
I first got the idea for a suit of mail
in 1967 when I saw a commercial diver

717
01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.760
<i>protecting his hands</i>
<i>with butcher's gloves.</i>

718
01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.360
VALERIE:<i> Ron made a decision</i>

719
01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.520
<i>that we would try</i>
<i>ourselves out as shark bait.</i>

720
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.000
<i>Marine biologist Jeremiah Sullivan</i>

721
01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.640
<i>has traveled from America</i>
<i>to join the operation.</i>

722
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.560
JEREMIAH:<i> At the time.</i>
<i>I was just a young student.</i>

723
01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.200
<i>I was studying the sensory systems</i>
<i>of sharks as a marine biologist.</i>

724
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.160
The shark suit provided us
an opportunity to do things

725
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.120
that have never been done before.
to really learn something.

726
01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.800
VALERIE: <i>Everything you do</i>
<i>in life is a calculated risk.</i>

727
01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.040
<i>Even a cup of tea could burn you.</i>

728
01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.360
<i>If only he would bite me</i>
<i>instead of the fish.</i>

729
01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.040
<i>it would be a good test</i>
<i>of the suit's protective qualities.</i>

730
01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.560
SYLVIA:<i> When I heard about Ron</i>
<i>and Valerie's desire to test the theory</i>

731
01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.840
that it's really dangerous
to go in the water. period.

732
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.240
because there's sharks. period.
that they will eat you. period.

733
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.400
<i>And Ron and Valerie wanting</i>
<i>to show that. you know. it's not that way.</i>

734
01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.040
You can bait yourself.
"Well. come and get me."

735
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.000
And the sharks
had to be encouraged somehow.

736
01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.720
JEREMIAH: <i>We still didn't really know</i>
<i>what would happen</i>

737
01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.560
<i>with shark bite pressure.</i>

738
01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:20.840
I knew what probably would happen.
but now. this was the real deal.

739
01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.080
VALERIE:<i> Scientific opinion</i>
<i>had the crush power</i>

740
01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:30.560
<i>of a shark's jaw as very serious indeed.</i>

741
01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.000
<i>Eugenie Clark. the great shark expert.</i>

742
01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.440
<i>said I would have the imprints</i>
<i>of the mesh on my bones.</i>

743
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.360
<i>The sharks don't have crush power.</i>

744
01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.560
<i>This is a misconception.</i>

745
01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.400
<i>We knew how they would bite.</i>

746
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.800
<i>They rely on the cutting edge</i>
<i>of their teeth.</i>

747
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.440
<i>They try to saw through the metal</i>
<i>and nothing happens.</i>

748
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:03.200
<i>They can't get anything in.</i>
<i>And we proved it with the mesh suit.</i>

749
01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:12.000
RON: <i>The editors of National Geographic</i>
<i>wanted to use the story.</i>

750
01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.800
<i>and they sent our story</i>
<i>to some American shark experts.</i>

751
01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.440
<i>and they rejected it as a hoax.</i>

752
01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.720
<i>But then we showed the editors our film.</i>

753
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.720
<i>And the editors realized that</i>
<i>the experts were wrong.</i>

754
01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.480
<i>The editors gave their referees</i>
<i>a kick in the backside.</i>

755
01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.280
JEREMIAH:<i> It's been 40 years</i>
<i>that they've been manufacturing</i>

756
01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.200
<i>these things on a commercial level.</i>

757
01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.240
<i>Now. there's a global shark diving</i>
<i>industry. about a billion dollars a year.</i>

758
01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.320
that. to a certain degree. has been built
out of the information

759
01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.480
that was gathered by use
of the suits that Ron and Val and I

760
01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:08.960
<i>started playing with so long ago.</i>

761
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.200
VALERIE:<i> It used to be brilliant</i>
<i>for blue sharks.</i>

762
01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.200
<i>Back then. we saw them every day.</i>

763
01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:26.800
They're a nice shark.
All the ones that bit me are all dead now.

764
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.840
They were finned.

765
01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.960
They're gone. they didn't deserve that.

766
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.120
RON:<i> There's a big market for sharks.</i>

767
01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:40.800
The shark fin is being taken
in enormous numbers.

768
01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:46.120
And you just can't continually
take something unless you replace it.

769
01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:56.040
In the last twenty years.
with the increase

770
01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.960
of the middle-class in China.

771
01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.760
and the increase
in shark fin soup consumption...

772
01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.160
<i>there were 100 million sharks</i>
<i>killed every year for twenty years.</i>

773

VALERIE: <i>Sharks are part of a web of life.</i>
<i>We've just interfered.</i>

774
01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:28.960
<i>It's a terrible thing to kill</i>
<i>a beautiful wild animal for its fin.</i>

775
01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:34.640
<i>Just like killing an elephant</i>
<i>for its tusk. and the tiger for its skin.</i>

776
01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:42.120
You can't expect a fisherman
on a little island

777
01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.720
to not catch sharks for their fins.

778
01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.600
and sell them to the Chinese traders.

779
01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.920
<i>It means good money.</i>

780
01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.920
<i>I used to climb on</i>
<i>to the shark finning boats...</i>

781

<i>and take photographs.</i>

782
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.280
<i>And one day.</i>
<i>there'll be very few sharks left.</i>

783
01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.560
<i>And these photographs will be proof</i>
<i>of where they went.</i>

784
01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.320
Shark pics. How many. many. many.
Sharks. sharks. sharks.

785
01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.560
SYLVIA:<i> We only have ten percent</i>
<i>of the sharks left.</i>

786
01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.000
<i>And it really is all about knowing.</i>
<i>that leads to caring.</i>

787
01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.080
Come on. These are magnificent creatures.

788
01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.200
every one an individual.

789
01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.760
VALERIE: Look at them.

790
01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.920
SYLVIA:
<i>Every one deserving of our respect.</i>

791
01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.480
VALERIE: Here's one of my old shots
that I really like.

792
01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.120
SYLVIA:<i> We just need to think differently.</i>

793
01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:55.200
VALERIE: See how he smiles.
Big smile on his face.

794
01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.360
<i>The only way to halt</i>
<i>the complete decimation</i>

795
01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.400
is to make enormous
marine national parks

796
01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.360
where you cannot take a thing.

797
01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.000
<i>For a long time. we could guarantee</i>
<i>great white sharks</i>

798
01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.400
<i>off Port Lincoln. South Australia.</i>

799
01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.240
Hello. sharkies!

800
01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.360
RON: Right on top.

801
01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.680
That's a different one!
That's Maria. I'll bet you.

802
01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.240
RON: Fins right out in the water.

803
01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.160
Let me look. I bet it's Maria.

804
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.160
JAYNE: <i>She'd love the whole world</i>
<i>to be protected</i>

805
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.360
<i>if she had half a chance.</i>

806
01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.520
Sweetness. Come on.

807
01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.120
RON: Shark.

808
01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.760
JAYNE: <i>But particularly</i>
<i>in South Australia. you know.</i>

809
01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.240
<i>it has been a huge part of her life.</i>

810
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.440
-RON: Welcome back.
-VALERIE: Hurry. hurry! She's coming back.

811
01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.760
RON: Hurry. She's coming back.

812
01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.320
And great whites. I think Valerie
would chain herself to a cage

813
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.360
if she thought somebody was going
to kill one unnecessarily.

814
01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.080
Just to show that.
"Hey. it's not gonna hurt me."

815
01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.680
VALERIE: <i>I wanted to show all sharks</i>
<i>have different personalities.</i>

816
01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.760
<i>and I've never seen anybody</i>
<i>hand-feeding a great white shark</i>

817
01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.080
<i>off the back of a boat.</i>

818
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.880
<i>There were three sharks around.</i>
<i>And one was very sweet.</i>

819
01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:31.120
<i>I wanted to give that nice shark.</i>
<i>it was a boy shark. my fish.</i>

820
01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:54.480
Mark. my nephew. was so worried about it.
He hung on to my shirt. and I thought.

821
01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.320
"That's not going to do any good.

822
01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:00.200
"If this thing grabs me. all you'll have
left is a handful of shirt."

823
01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:43.240
<i>Don't tell me they don't have</i>
<i>personalities. They do.</i>

824
01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.640
JAYNE:<i> We need people like Valerie</i>
<i>out there to do that.</i>

825
01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:55.360
<i>And she went through government</i>
<i>to get that area protected.</i>

826
01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.120
<i>Thankfully. it happened.</i>

827
01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.920
<i>It was named</i>
<i>Ron and Valerie Taylor Marine Park.</i>

828
01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:11.040
<i>I think it's ironic that the same place</i>
<i>where they filmed </i>Jaws

829
01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.640
<i>is now a place where</i>
<i>great white sharks are protected.</i>

830
01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.160
VALERIE:<i> When we made</i>
<i>our first shark film. Ron said.</i>

831
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:28.120
<i>"Well. we've done the shark film.</i>
<i>now we'll go to something else."</i>

832
01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.920
<i>We were still doing them.</i>

833
01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.640
<i>And we couldn't make a living doing</i>
<i>the same thing with a butterfly.</i>

834
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.920
<i>Gee. it'd have to be some butterfly.</i>

835
01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.960
<i>Our marriage was a type of adventure.</i>

836
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.880
<i>Ron. he liked me to be</i>
<i>in front of his camera.</i>

837
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.600
<i>He liked me to be diving with him.</i>

838
01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:09.800
<i>And it's not just loving someone.</i>
<i>You can love a lot of things.</i>

839
01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.360
<i>There's all sorts of love.</i>

840
01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.840
VALERIE:<i> He didn't feel very well.</i>

841
01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.960
<i>And he went to our doctor.</i>

842
01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:31.880
And the doctor said
he has acute myeloid leukemia.

843
01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.400
<i>He said it's always fatal.</i>

844
01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.600
Getting ready for a night dive.

845
01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:41.840
I like night diving.

846
01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:46.440
It's very interesting
because you see critters at night

847
01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.200
that you don't see during the day.

848
01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.200
MALE VOICE: All right. guys!
Good luck. guys! Learn lots!

849
01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.840
Bye!

850
01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.680
JAYNE: <i>You'd never see Valerie</i>
<i>afraid of anything.</i>

851
01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.120
<i>She knew he was going to die.</i>

852
01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.960
<i>But she didn't face it.</i>

853
01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.640
VALERIE:<i> I didn't think</i>
<i>Ron would ever die.</i>

854
01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:31.000
I'd look at that beautiful man
and think that. "He can't die."

855
01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.400
He was quite beautiful.

856
01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.560
I thought.

857
01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:49.480
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:<i> Ron Taylor and his wife</i>
<i>Valerie gave away hunting to become famous</i>

858
01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.000
<i>for their dedication</i>
<i>to marine conservation.</i>

859
01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.280
<i>Mr. Taylor died peacefully</i>
<i>at a private hospital</i>

860
01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.320
<i>near his Sydney home this morning.</i>

861
01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.280
VALERIE:
<i>I do miss him. I miss him so much.</i>

862
01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:05.720
<i>He was everything.</i>

863
01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.480
<i>Mostly. I miss just cuddling up</i>
<i>in bed. really.</i>

864
01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.240
<i>I go to bed and there's no Ron.</i>

865
01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:20.640
It's a sort of lonely thing.
I take a pillow.

866
01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.600
I put it on my left side. my pillow.

867
01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:57.480
<i>Ron and I did our last dive together</i>
<i>in Fiji with the bull sharks.</i>

868
01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.040

872
01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.320
<i>for her to dive places</i>
<i>that she dived with Ron.</i>

873
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.960
I remember her saying that she thought

<i>Ron and Valerie were instrumental</i>

this great conservation

<i>They became very. very involved</i>
<i>with the local community.</i>

878
01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:47.640
<i>Due to overfishing. you had a completely</i>
<i>dead reef. no fish on it. nothing.</i>

879
01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:54.200
<i>And over time. by feeding the sharks.</i>
<i>now it's the only place I know of</i>

880
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:58.400
<i>where you're likely to see</i>
<i>as many as 80 or 100 bull sharks.</i>

-Okay. So. you're going to look after me?
-I will.

888

-Why is that?
-I'm so old.

890
01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.400
-No.
-And I hurt.

891

-Thank you so much.

I understand that you have a
nice pale wetsuit. is that right?

895
01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.440
I have a pink wetsuit. but I've...

896
01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.360
-Wow.
-...hurt my shoulder...

897
01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.720
-Mm-hmm.
-...and I can't get it on. Anyway.

898

900
01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.600
Concentrate. Concentrate.

901
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:11.760
Ouch. Never mind. It's all right.

904
01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:33.280

906

VALERIE:<i> The village that owns</i>

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.320
It was only his tail.

949
01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.200
I think some of them
probably recognized you.

950
01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.640
-I think so.
-BEN: You were so close.

951
01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.080
-VALERIE: Yeah. They come in.
-(CHUCKLES)

952
01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:36.920
I do know them. Like. I've known them
for a long time I think.

953
01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.040
SYLVIA:<i> No one can do everything.</i>

954
01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:47.480
<i>And Valerie has clearly done</i>
<i>more than her share.</i>

955
01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.960
<i>But there is cause for hope.</i>

956
01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.440
And all we have to do
is look at Valerie and say.

957
01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:57.240
"Look. Look what she's done. why not you?"

958
01:26:58.840 --> 01:26:59.720
Anyhow...

959
01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.560
here's to the sharks!
