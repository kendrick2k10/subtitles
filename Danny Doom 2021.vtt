00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:24.750
[narrator] On September 11th. 2001. something happened that
affected me for the rest of my life.

4
00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:27.708
[baby crying]

5
00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:29.791
[doctor] Look who's ready for the world!

6
00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:32.125
[narrator] I was born.

7
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:38.750
I wasn't the first kid to be born on a bad day.

8
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.375
There were kids born on Sandy Hook. Columbine. Pearl
Harbor...

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.041
but notice how none of them were named by the date on the
calendar?

10
00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:50.083
That only happened with September 11th.

11
00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:52.958
So what am I supposed to do with a birthday like that?

12
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.791
It's not like I can call it "Danny Day" and expect you to
know what I'm talking about.

13
00:00:57.583 --> 00:01:00.291
I have to say it's September 11th.

14
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.875
You can see how I developed some issues.

15
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.833
[narrator] If you think the other kids were nice and
understanding about it

16
00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.500
you've been watching too many movies.

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.416
[laughs] Nice one Danny Doom!

18
00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:14.916
[narrator] That's what they called me.

19
00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:16.083
Danny Doom.

20
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.708
Because somehow everything about me was a disaster.

21
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:20.541
He should have a party.

22
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:21.458
But it's awkward.

23
00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:23.000
Why? 9/11 wasn't his fault.

24
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.458
Right. it wasn't his fault.

25
00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:25.916
No. it was W's. right?

26
00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:28.083
Obama would have saved the day like a superhero!

27
00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:29.458
[mom] Don't you dare make fun of him!

28
00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:33.291
[narrator] After mom left. dad tried having a party for
me...

29
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:34.208
but no one came.

30
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.375
Either because they didn't want to see me. or him.

31
00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:39.625
Happy September 11th.

32
00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:43.833
[narrator] And so. since no one wanted to be my friend.

33
00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:45.916
I developed a life of the mind.

34
00:01:45.916 --> 00:01:47.708
Hello ladies and gentlemen.

35
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:52.583
Today I have something very important to say. so that means
you all must listen.

36
00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:54.916
That includes you. Mr. Ballinger.

37
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.375
[narrator] Then in high school. I met someone who changed
my life.

38
00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:57.916
Hey!

39
00:01:58.208 --> 00:01:59.541
New youth group.

40
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:03.125
Everyone's welcome.

41
00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:05.291
[narrator] His name was Jesus.

42
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.458
See you there!

43
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:08.208
[narrator] I was born again.

44
00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:11.000
Which I was happy about because the first time hadn't gone
so well.

45
00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:12.166
Amen.

46
00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:14.500
[narrator] Things were all right after that.

47
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.041
Until the day I got the news that changed everything.

48
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.291
So what's the news?

49
00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.375
It'll take some time to explain.

50
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.916
Perhaps we could sit down?

51
00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:26.583
Sure.

52
00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:32.333
I appreciate you having me by on such short notice.

53
00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:34.250
I'm always happy to see you. Pastor.

54
00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:36.833
Although I don't know why you couldn't have just texted me.

55
00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:41.333
Well... some things are best said when looking someone in
the eye.

56
00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:46.625
So last night I met with the elders to discuss your
proposal.

57
00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.750
They thought it was very ambitious.

58
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.583
Starting a drama ministry.

59
00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:53.041
joining the church staff.

60
00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:55.875
and all while attending Bible college full time?

61
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:56.541
[text chime]

62
00:02:58.291 --> 00:02:59.666
I know it's a lot.

63
00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:01.583
I can handle it.

64
00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:03.666
That's exactly the question they had.

65
00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:05.541
How would he handle it?

66
00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:06.583
I'll find a way.

67
00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:08.416
I want to help people find hope in Jesus.

68
00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:09.375
Like I have.

69
00:03:09.458 --> 00:03:09.958
[text chime]

70
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:11.791
[text chime]

71
00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:13.875
Could you turn that off. please?

72
00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.583
I'd rather we speak uninterrupted.

73
00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:18.041
Sure. no problem.

74
00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:22.208
What you proposed would be extremely difficult.

75
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.500
Temptation would come your way that you could not give in
to.

76
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:27.250
I know. That's why I want to do it.

77
00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:27.583
[call tone]

78
00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.125
Hey. did you hear the news?

79
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.375
I gotta call you back. Beau.

80
00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:33.625
[Beau] This is an emergency.

81
00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:35.250
Okay. all right. Well tell me later.

82
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.291
Megan Hendrickson broke up with her boyfriend.

83
00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:38.500
♬

84
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.208
So. like I was saying...

85
00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:45.625
Full time ministry is not easy.

86
00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:46.916
And many who are...

87
00:03:46.916 --> 00:03:49.541
[narrator] Megan Hendrickson broke up with her boyfriend?

88
00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:54.333
Megan Hendrickson broke up with her boyfriend!

89
00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:56.500
Danny?

90
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.791
[narrator] Beau was right.

91
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:59.125
This was an emergency.

92
00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:02.958
Excuse me. please.

93
00:04:03.916 --> 00:04:05.916
[narrator] I knew Megan from Bible Club at school.

94
00:04:05.916 --> 00:04:07.625
She had been dating Damian for a year.

95
00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:09.208
even though he wasn't a Christian.

96
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.166
A lucky break.

97
00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:13.208
Finally.

98
00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:14.750
It was time to act.

99
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:41.166
♬

100
00:04:43.332 --> 00:04:44.291
Hey Megan.

101
00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:46.916
Hi. Donny.

102
00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:49.791
It's Danny.

103
00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:52.166
Danny. Right. Sorry.

104
00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:54.582
Nah. that's cool.

105
00:04:57.291 --> 00:04:59.582
So what brings you by?

106
00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:03.875
I... wanted... to see you.

107
00:05:05.416 --> 00:05:06.750
How do you know where I live?

108
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:07.916
I follow you.

109
00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.500
Online. Um...

110
00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.125
You've posted pictures of your house.

111
00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:13.916
Oh. Okay.

112
00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:14.666
Um...

113
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:16.750
So what's up?

114
00:05:17.832 --> 00:05:19.957
I... I heard the news.

115
00:05:20.332 --> 00:05:21.332
And uh...

116
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.041
that's crazy.

117
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.500
You were supposed to go on tour with him. right?

118
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.625
That was the plan.

119
00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:27.207
Ha!

120
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.082
Uh...

121
00:05:30.082 --> 00:05:31.250
listen. Danny...

122
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.416
I'm busy. but...

123
00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.250
thanks for stopping by.

124
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.875
No. no. wait!

125
00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:36.707
Um...

126
00:05:36.707 --> 00:05:38.041
I have to tell you something.

127
00:05:38.332 --> 00:05:38.791
Um...

128
00:05:39.957 --> 00:05:40.916
I wanted to tell you...

129
00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:42.500
that...

130
00:05:43.832 --> 00:05:45.082
you should be encouraged.

131
00:05:46.207 --> 00:05:47.250
Because...

132
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.791
God has someone else for you.

133
00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:50.082
Oh.

134
00:05:50.582 --> 00:05:52.750
You came by to encourage me?

135
00:05:52.832 --> 00:05:53.582
Well...

136
00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:54.791
yeah.

137
00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:57.166
Aw. that's so sweet.

138
00:05:57.332 --> 00:05:58.957
You're such a nice guy. Danny.

139
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:01.041
Thanks. I really needed that.

140
00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:04.916
Yeah? Well. you know. there's more where that came from.

141
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.208
Because. um...

142
00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:09.625
now that you're available...

143
00:06:09.666 --> 00:06:10.875
I thought. um...

144
00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:12.708
that. uh...

145
00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:14.250
you and I...

146
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:15.958
should...

147
00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:17.791
get coffee.

148
00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:21.875
Uh. thanks. Danny. but...

149
00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:22.916
I'm busy.

150
00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:27.082
No. not right now.

151
00:06:27.082 --> 00:06:29.375
I just meant. um. sometime when you're free.

152
00:06:29.457 --> 00:06:30.832
I'll be busy for awhile.

153
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.125
Doing what?

154
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.041
The tour was gonna be all summer.

155
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:36.707
Something came up.

156
00:06:38.125 --> 00:06:40.207
Wait. are you saying...

157
00:06:45.457 --> 00:06:46.332
Really?

158
00:06:49.416 --> 00:06:51.166
But you broke up with Damian.

159
00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:52.666
Yeah. This morning.

160
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:55.250
I know. That's why I came over.

161
00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:58.041
Danny. you can't just ask me for a date out of the blue.

162
00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:59.250
It's not out of the blue.

163
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.416
I've been thinking about this for months.

164
00:07:01.416 --> 00:07:04.625
Thank you. again. for the encouragement. but...

165
00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.500
God has someone else for you. too.

166
00:07:10.416 --> 00:07:14.166
♬

167
00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:19.707
[narrator] Have you ever had a moment where you realized
something you believed in completely was completely wrong?

168
00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:22.541
I had a dream where Megan and Damian broke up

169
00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:24.916
and she went out with me instead.

170
00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:26.916
I thought if the break up happened in real life

171
00:07:26.916 --> 00:07:29.791
it would be a sign from God that I should ask her out.

172
00:07:30.582 --> 00:07:33.332
But then what you just saw happen happened.

173
00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:35.875
Danny Doom strikes again.

174
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:44.791
Danny.

175
00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:47.041
Hey. Pastor.

176
00:07:47.332 --> 00:07:49.041
So glad you're back.

177
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.125
Can we continue?

178
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.707
Sure.

179
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:58.041
It sounded like you had bad news for me?

180
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:00.041
Well. actually. it's good news.

181
00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:02.041
Your proposal's been accepted.

182
00:08:02.708 --> 00:08:05.208
I was trying to be dramatic before.

183
00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:06.791
I thought you'd like that.

184
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:08.458
Then you left for an hour.

185
00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:11.583
And I was thinking. should I stay? Should I go?

186
00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:13.791
Real plot twist for me.

187
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:15.083
Sorry about that.

188
00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:17.125
Something came up.

189
00:08:17.957 --> 00:08:19.791
Well. you got it all.

190
00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:23.041
The internship. The drama program. The scholarship.

191
00:08:23.332 --> 00:08:25.375
You're in full time ministry now.

192
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:30.500
And... the elders and I believe you should not be called
Danny Doom

193
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.415
but Danny Do.

194
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.165
Because you're gonna do great things for the Lord.

195
00:08:37.082 --> 00:08:38.040
Thank you.

196
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.250
That's all I ever wanted.

197
00:08:40.332 --> 00:08:41.750
[narrator] Which was true.

198
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.415
Yesterday.

199
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.500
Did something happen with that girl?

200
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:46.915
No.

201
00:08:48.083 --> 00:08:49.000
What girl?

202
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.083
The one Beau called you about.

203
00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:54.165
Beau's always saying crazy things.

204
00:08:55.165 --> 00:08:56.500
I wouldn't worry about it.

205
00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:58.250
Okay.

206
00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:03.333
Well. even though I'm your boss now.

207
00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:04.958
I'm still your pastor.

208
00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:06.875
You can talk to me.

209
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Thank you.

210
00:09:10.541 --> 00:09:11.875
I appreciate that.

211
00:09:13.541 --> 00:09:14.166
Well...

212
00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:18.541
be ready for joys and sorrows.

213
00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.166
There's a big spotlight on you now.

214
00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:23.041
But it's not about you.

215
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.041
You have to help people see Jesus.

216
00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:28.916
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

217
00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:31.375
And when you're tempted to be selfish...

218
00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:33.750
you'll have to fight yourself.

219
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.915
Are you ready for that?

220
00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.540
It's a beautiful day and the sun is shining on all God made.

221
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.458
What a beautiful day to tell our friend Hambone about Jesus.

222
00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:49.540
Hello there. Hambone!

223
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.540
Hello.

224
00:09:52.165 --> 00:09:53.915
What have you been up to. Hambone?

225
00:09:53.915 --> 00:09:55.958
Playing rockin' shows with my band.

226
00:09:56.458 --> 00:09:58.165
I have a question for you. Hambone.

227
00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:00.791
What do you believe about Jesus?

228
00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:03.875
That dude from a million years ago?

229
00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:05.416
What's it matter?

230
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.708
Jesus died for our sins. Hambone.

231
00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:09.625
It matters lot's.

232
00:10:10.166 --> 00:10:12.500
You know what's a lot cooler than a dead guy?

233
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.625
A live guy.

234
00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.583
Like this guy playing live at the Paramount tonight.

235
00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:20.333
But Hambone. Jesus is alive!

236
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:30.333
But Hambone. Jesus is alive!

237
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.125
But Hambone --

238
00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:41.375
At my show tonight there's gonna be a choir!

239
00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:45.415
A choir of drunk babes!

240
00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:47.875
But Hambone. Jesus is alive --

241
00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:52.083
After the show me and the drunk babes are gonna go scream at
old people

242
00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:54.250
to give them heart attacks.

243
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.165
But Hambone --

244
00:10:55.165 --> 00:10:56.500
And when the paramedics come

245
00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.041
we're gonna steal an ambulance and go joy riding around for
car crashes.

246
00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:03.875
And when the people see us and they say. "We're saved!"

247
00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:06.125
We're gonna smash into them!

248
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:09.208
And then their mothers are gonna show up and cry.

249
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.958
And we will pull their hair out.

250
00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.458
But Hambone. Jesus is alive!

251
00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:23.208
Alive? How is that possible?

252
00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:24.708
Because Jesus is God!

253
00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:27.125
After he died. he rose again!

254
00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:29.083
And if we repent and believe

255
00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:31.416
we'll have life after death with him.

256
00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:34.375
Whoa. You know what I think?

257
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.000
What do you think. Hambone?

258
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.333
Jesus rocks.

259
00:11:44.165 --> 00:11:46.000
Bye. guys! Bye!

260
00:11:46.165 --> 00:11:47.540
What was with the improv?

261
00:11:47.625 --> 00:11:48.875
Inspiration struck.

262
00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:50.500
Well if it strikes again. I'm striking you.

263
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.958
You made us look like idiots.

264
00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:52.708
Who cares?

265
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.083
The kids liked it.

266
00:11:54.083 --> 00:11:56.540
Where was this inspiration when you were writing the script?

267
00:11:56.625 --> 00:11:58.790
The muse visits when she pleases.

268
00:11:58.875 --> 00:12:00.250
You've been nothing but negative lately.

269
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.583
What's the matter with you?

270
00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.208
Oh man. you did it. Didn't you?

271
00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:05.250
Did what?

272
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.708
Asked out Megan Hendrickson.

273
00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:07.958
But she has a boyfriend.

274
00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.208
Not since last week.

275
00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:10.666
When did you do it?

276
00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:11.916
After we talked.

277
00:12:12.208 --> 00:12:14.083
Oh man. right after?

278
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:17.291
Danny Doom strikes again!

279
00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:20.208
You're the one who called the breakup emergency news.

280
00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:22.291
Yeah. cause I never thought it would happen.

281
00:12:22.291 --> 00:12:25.208
I also never thought you'd ask her out the same day.

282
00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:26.291
What's wrong with that?

283
00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:27.500
Well did she say yes?

284
00:12:27.541 --> 00:12:28.083
No.

285
00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:29.208
That's what's wrong with that.

286
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.833
Okay. Everything I do is wrong.

287
00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:31.708
Good talk. guys.

288
00:12:31.833 --> 00:12:34.500
It seems we need to speak in a language you understand.

289
00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:36.750
So may we present...

290
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.165
The Error of Danny's Ways!

291
00:12:39.165 --> 00:12:40.958
A play in one act.

292
00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:42.875
I shall play the part of Megan.

293
00:12:42.915 --> 00:12:44.375
Good luck finding an audience.

294
00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:49.000
Our play begins with the young lady lamenting the loss of
her lover.

295
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.458
[with accent] Lawdy. lawdy. I'm so lonely.

296
00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:54.790
For the bond between my dear Damian and I has been torn
asunder.

297
00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:56.125
Why is she Southern?

298
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:01.750
Hark! It is as if light hath shined from the heavens upon
your fair face. sweet Megan.

299
00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:05.708
My. my. What a sudden and obvious show of affection. I do
declare.

300
00:13:05.833 --> 00:13:08.000
So you're Southern and he's Shakespeare?

301
00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:08.833
That makes no sense.

302
00:13:08.833 --> 00:13:12.250
Dear. sweet Megan. I shall unpack my heart before you.

303
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.791
Tis true. we've never spoken before...

304
00:13:13.791 --> 00:13:14.541
Tis not true!

305
00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:18.041
Yet I have spent hours. days. months

306
00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:22.458
gazing at your image on the screen for I worship your beauty
like an idol.

307
00:13:22.666 --> 00:13:25.708
Land a' Goshen! How uncomfortable this makes me.

308
00:13:25.833 --> 00:13:28.916
I shall take no notice of your discomfort and continue my
entreaty.

309
00:13:29.166 --> 00:13:32.333
For. despite all evidence to the contrary

310
00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:37.958
I do believe this is the perfect time and manner of which to
ask you for a date.

311
00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.500
You and I on a date? [laughs]

312
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.958
Is the Pope Protestant?

313
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.915
What's this?

314
00:13:42.915 --> 00:13:44.208
No. you say?

315
00:13:44.208 --> 00:13:45.665
However could this be?

316
00:13:45.708 --> 00:13:49.625
It is the customary response to those who approach a lady in
such a manner.

317
00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:53.790
Oh. how devastated I am by this unforeseen outcome!

318
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:54.915
Alas...

319
00:13:55.665 --> 00:14:01.375
I shall die alone! For I failed to heed the advice of my
friends.

320
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.875
Two thumbs down.

321
00:14:04.875 --> 00:14:07.791
The contrived narrative was insulting to the audience.

322
00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:09.083
We're trying to help you.

323
00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:12.666
You don't have to do anything crazy to get a girlfriend.
Just be yourself.

324
00:14:12.666 --> 00:14:13.958
And it will happen.

325
00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:17.250
Probably with someone you just happen be around.

326
00:14:19.375 --> 00:14:21.166
Someone I just happen to be around.

327
00:14:23.541 --> 00:14:24.791
Maybe that's what I was missing!

328
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:27.916
So the next few days I happened to be around Megan all the
time.

329
00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:29.958
♬

330
00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:30.875
Hey Megan!

331
00:14:30.875 --> 00:14:32.290
What brings you out here?

332
00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:34.750
Hey Megan!

333
00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:36.165
What brings you out here?

334
00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.583
Hey Megan!

335
00:14:43.625 --> 00:14:45.915
What are the odds that we'd meet out here in the forest?

336
00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:51.165
Hey Megan!

337
00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:53.750
Oh my gosh! Fancy meeting you here.

338
00:14:55.375 --> 00:14:56.083
Hey Megan!

339
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.625
Megan.

340
00:14:58.208 --> 00:14:58.833
Goodness.

341
00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:02.458
Hey Megan!

342
00:15:03.708 --> 00:15:04.416
Hey Megan!

343
00:15:04.583 --> 00:15:05.375
Hey Megan!

344
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:05.958
Hey Megan!

345
00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:06.375
Ah!

346
00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:07.166
Hey Megan!

347
00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:09.291
Oh hey! Here. I'll catch up with you.

348
00:15:12.416 --> 00:15:13.458
Hey Megan!

349
00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.041
Oh. that's right. You live on this street.

350
00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:17.000
[sighs]

351
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.666
I just happened to be purchasing some organic beets

352
00:15:19.666 --> 00:15:21.875
and decided to walk home instead of polluting --

353
00:15:21.875 --> 00:15:23.583
Danny. this has to stop.

354
00:15:24.666 --> 00:15:25.583
What?

355
00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:27.666
Coming up with excuses to see me.

356
00:15:29.583 --> 00:15:31.041
I really did buy the beets.

357
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:34.125
Look. I know you have it in your head that this is going to
work somehow

358
00:15:34.125 --> 00:15:36.415
but it's not. It's working against you.

359
00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:39.458
Did I catch you at a bad time?

360
00:15:39.708 --> 00:15:41.083
Listen. I'll just take my beets and go.

361
00:15:41.165 --> 00:15:42.415
No more. Danny. Okay?

362
00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:43.290
I understand.

363
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.040
See you later.

364
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.458
No. Don't see me later.

365
00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:46.625
Okay. not later.

366
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:47.625
Some other time.

367
00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:49.125
We had Bible Club all year.

368
00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:50.875
Why didn't you say anything then?

369
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.750
You were with Damian.

370
00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:55.875
So you were following the rules?

371
00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:58.708
Here's another one:

372
00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.041
Leave me alone.

376
00:16:58.583 --> 00:17:00.083
Hello. Theresia.

377
00:17:00.375 --> 00:17:02.416
Hey. You don't look ready.

378
00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.083
I thought they cancelled.

379
00:17:04.083 --> 00:17:06.750
The first church did but then a different one booked us.

380
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.500
All that time on your phone. I guess none of it was on
email?

381
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.875
Be ready in 10. I'll pick you up.

382
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.500
Where are we. anyway?

383
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.875
Hope Community Church.

384
00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:34.208
Get me out of here. Now.

385
00:17:34.208 --> 00:17:35.916
But they booked us. We have to perform.

386
00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.750
This is Megan's church.

387
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:38.875
Oh.

388
00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.000
Well it'll be fine. Just don't make a big deal out of it.

389
00:17:41.041 --> 00:17:42.708
No. you have to go on without me.

390
00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:45.416
No. we don't. Because it's not a big deal. Remember?

391
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.500
Beau can be Hambone. You can read the other lines.

392
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.833
You can't just abandon us. This is your program.

393
00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:52.041
She probably won't be here. It's for Jr. High kids.

394
00:17:52.041 --> 00:17:53.958
She works with Jr. High kids!

395
00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.166
Then this is your chance to show her you can be cool about
it.

396
00:17:56.166 --> 00:17:58.916
If she sees me she's not gonna be cool about it.

397
00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:02.333
Did you bring the other costumes?

398
00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:03.416
Yeah. Why?

399
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.458
I have to make sure she can't recognize me.

401
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.791
Rock n' roll.

402
00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:34.541
At my show tonight there's gonna be a choir.

403
00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.958
A choir of drunk babes!

404
00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:42.291
No. I... I already did that one.

405
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.083
There's gonna be a symphony.

406
00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:49.916
A gang symphony.

407
00:18:49.916 --> 00:18:53.000
That uses violin strings to strangle puppies.

408
00:18:53.208 --> 00:18:58.166
And then they throw the dead puppies at pastors while
they're trying to preach their sermons.

409
00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.958
Uh. can I help you?

410
00:19:03.833 --> 00:19:04.833
Hello.

411
00:19:07.458 --> 00:19:09.041
Am I interrupting something?

412
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:13.625
Okay. then.

413
00:19:13.666 --> 00:19:14.791
Good talk.

414
00:19:16.833 --> 00:19:17.708
Hey.

415
00:19:19.083 --> 00:19:20.833
Don't you recognize me?

416
00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:22.333
No.

417
00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:25.166
Are you sure?

418
00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:27.291
I never forget a face tattoo.

419
00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:30.375
Well good.

420
00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:31.625
Cause uh...

421
00:19:32.125 --> 00:19:33.958
if you recognized me that'd be trouble.

422
00:19:34.458 --> 00:19:35.333
Why?

423
00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:37.250
Cause you'd want an autograph.

424
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.916
And then other people would see and then everyone would want
autographs. and...

425
00:19:40.916 --> 00:19:43.291
that would defeat the whole purpose of me hiding back here.

426
00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:46.000
Well you picked a bad place to hide.

427
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.666
There are like a hundred kids on their way to church here.

428
00:19:48.666 --> 00:19:50.166
Ah. cruel irony.

429
00:19:51.916 --> 00:19:53.125
What were you saying before?

430
00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:55.625
Something about dead puppies?

431
00:19:57.083 --> 00:19:59.083
Oh. well that's just a story I like to tell.

432
00:19:59.083 --> 00:20:03.000
About how I defeated the terrible puppy killing gang.

433
00:20:03.166 --> 00:20:05.541
And you like to tell it alone behind a church?

434
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.125
Well. yeah.

435
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.916
Cause you never know who might hear.

436
00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:13.708
Who are you?

437
00:20:16.291 --> 00:20:17.333
I'm Hambone.

438
00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:21.416
Well. Hambone...

439
00:20:21.416 --> 00:20:22.541
I'm Megan.

440
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.583
So how'd you do it?

441
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:29.916
Uh. do what?

442
00:20:30.041 --> 00:20:31.541
Defeat the puppy killing gang.

443
00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:34.833
Well I taught the puppies how to fight back.

444
00:20:35.916 --> 00:20:37.000
You know. you're funny.

445
00:20:37.416 --> 00:20:38.666
I bet you're popular at parties.

446
00:20:38.666 --> 00:20:40.083
Oh. I'm the man at parties.

447
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:42.833
Every year. on my birthday. I have...

448
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.958
a hundred friends over!

449
00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:46.416
It's my favorite day of the year.

450
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:50.375
They usually spend the first hour thanking me for previous
parties and then we --

451
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:53.708
Look. I gotta get in there. but I want to hear more.

452
00:20:54.666 --> 00:20:57.416
Maybe if you're around after we could meet up?

453
00:20:58.291 --> 00:20:59.750
Or you could just join us.

454
00:20:59.875 --> 00:21:03.208
It would be nice to finally have someone interesting in
there.

455
00:21:04.416 --> 00:21:07.250
How about instead you and I get out of here?

456
00:21:08.708 --> 00:21:09.625
Right now?

457
00:21:09.916 --> 00:21:10.916
Yeah.

458
00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:13.125
My dad's the pastor. I can't just skip it.

459
00:21:13.791 --> 00:21:14.833
You can if you're with me.

460
00:21:20.583 --> 00:21:21.666
Danny!

461
00:21:21.875 --> 00:21:24.000
We're on in about seven min...

462
00:21:26.791 --> 00:21:28.208
Danny. where you at?

463
00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:31.416
I'm in Pamplona. Spain. Running with the bulls. right?

464
00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:34.666
And one of them comes along that everybody's afraid of.

465
00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:36.750
El Diablo. they called him.

466
00:21:37.083 --> 00:21:38.458
I see him and I just stop.

467
00:21:39.333 --> 00:21:40.833
And I just stand there looking at him.

468
00:21:41.083 --> 00:21:42.250
In the middle of Spain.

469
00:21:42.666 --> 00:21:43.958
When he gets close...

470
00:21:44.375 --> 00:21:46.875
I turn. backflip. and land right on top of him.

471
00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:49.541
He bucks and he bucks but he can't shake me.

472
00:21:49.583 --> 00:21:52.750
The locals cheer and some old timer starts playing me a
song.

473
00:21:53.375 --> 00:21:57.333
And I shout. "Hey man! Toss me that guitar!"

474
00:21:57.541 --> 00:22:00.625
And I compose a song right there on the bull.

475
00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:02.458
When we get to the arena

476
00:22:02.458 --> 00:22:04.541
I play the song and it...

477
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:06.416
convinces them to let the bulls live.

478
00:22:07.458 --> 00:22:09.041
And to treat animals humanely.

479
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:13.250
El Diablo wanted to marry me after that. but...

480
00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:16.166
the laws in Spain wouldn't allow it at the time.

481
00:22:16.166 --> 00:22:18.250
That's good. You should tell that one tonight.

482
00:22:19.125 --> 00:22:20.583
Isn't that what I just did?

483
00:22:20.583 --> 00:22:21.666
No. I mean at the party.

484
00:22:21.666 --> 00:22:22.416
Whoa.

485
00:22:23.125 --> 00:22:24.791
You never said anything about a party.

486
00:22:24.833 --> 00:22:27.083
That's cause I wasn't sure if I wanted to bring you yet.

487
00:22:27.083 --> 00:22:29.041
But now I am. You'll be a hit.

488
00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:30.625
I don't want to go to a party.

489
00:22:30.958 --> 00:22:31.916
Why?

490
00:22:31.958 --> 00:22:33.000
You don't seem busy.

491
00:22:33.458 --> 00:22:34.458
What if...

492
00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:36.291
somebody recognizes me?

493
00:22:36.625 --> 00:22:37.500
They won't.

494
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.500
How do you know?

495
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.750
Because you're putting on an act.

496
00:22:39.916 --> 00:22:42.166
I mean whoever you are you've got it buried deep.

497
00:22:42.583 --> 00:22:44.250
I could use that kind of crazy tonight.

498
00:22:45.291 --> 00:22:46.666
Are you calling me a liar?

499
00:22:46.791 --> 00:22:50.000
Anyone named Hambone would never tell anyone his real name.

500
00:22:50.083 --> 00:22:52.125
Now you have a chance to prove you're as bold as you say.

501
00:22:52.125 --> 00:22:53.875
This is not how I want to prove it.

502
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.541
Why? What are you afraid of?

503
00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:58.625
I don't want to hang out with a bunch of people I don't
know.

504
00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:00.083
What's bold about that?

505
00:23:00.375 --> 00:23:01.000
[sighs]

506
00:23:01.208 --> 00:23:01.958
Okay.

507
00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:06.583
It's getting pretty late. I should probably go.

508
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:07.791
It's like five.

509
00:23:07.833 --> 00:23:09.375
I know. So late.

510
00:23:10.833 --> 00:23:12.375
It was nice knowing you. Hambone.

511
00:23:18.291 --> 00:23:19.041
Hey!

512
00:23:20.708 --> 00:23:23.333
These uh. people at the party. What are they like?

513
00:23:23.458 --> 00:23:24.291
I mean...

514
00:23:24.791 --> 00:23:25.708
Are they cool?

515
00:23:25.791 --> 00:23:26.666
No.

516
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.250
That's why I need you.

517
00:23:32.291 --> 00:23:33.375
All right. then.

518
00:23:34.083 --> 00:23:35.333
Let's party.

519
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
[narrator] I had never seen the house before.

520
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.666
But I knew whose it was.

521
00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:42.666
And I knew why Megan wanted me there.

524
00:24:05.041 --> 00:24:06.333
Hello. Damian.

525
00:24:18.583 --> 00:24:20.333
You seem surprised to see me.

526
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.166
Did you forget that I was invited to this party?

527
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:26.500
I suppose I did.

528
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.791
Which you can understand. considering what's happened
between then and now.

529
00:24:30.916 --> 00:24:32.916
You said we should still be friends.

530
00:24:32.916 --> 00:24:36.291
So I thought I'd drop by and wish you luck on the tour.

531
00:24:36.791 --> 00:24:38.416
How friendly of you.

532
00:24:41.166 --> 00:24:42.333
How are you. Todd?

533
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.875
I'm good.

534
00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:46.708
You get that fill worked out?

535
00:24:47.375 --> 00:24:48.250
Yep.

536
00:24:50.625 --> 00:24:51.958
Ready for the road.

537
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.625
Now I haven't met you before

538
00:24:56.625 --> 00:24:59.666
but I recognize you from the pictures he's been posting.

539
00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:01.875
This is Jeannie.

540
00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:04.916
She'll be with us for all sixteen cities.

541
00:25:05.625 --> 00:25:06.875
Lucky you.

542
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.541
I'm Megan.

543
00:25:10.166 --> 00:25:12.041
And how do you two know each other?

544
00:25:13.208 --> 00:25:14.666
Oh come on. Jeannie.

545
00:25:15.666 --> 00:25:17.708
I've told you all about Megan.

546
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:22.500
Who'd you bring with you?

547
00:25:23.291 --> 00:25:24.666
This is my new friend. Hambone.

548
00:25:25.166 --> 00:25:26.166
Hambone?

549
00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.083
Is that your real name?

550
00:25:30.375 --> 00:25:31.500
Real name?

551
00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:34.041
What does that even mean?

552
00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:36.208
Hey.

553
00:25:36.208 --> 00:25:37.541
Don't I know you?

554
00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.166
What?

555
00:25:39.166 --> 00:25:41.625
Yeah. didn't we have a class together?

556
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.333
No. I'm not from here.

557
00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:46.166
Todd. if you're watching this. you were right.

558
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:47.958
It was English.

559
00:25:48.791 --> 00:25:50.166
So where are you from?

560
00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:52.458
Kansas.

561
00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:55.208
The roughest city in the whole state.

562
00:25:56.125 --> 00:25:57.875
But I left when I was twelve cause

563
00:25:57.875 --> 00:26:00.625
after seven years on the streets I had nothing left to
prove.

564
00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:04.125
I didn't know there were any cities like that in Kansas.

565
00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:05.708
What's it called?

566
00:26:07.083 --> 00:26:08.375
Some called it hell.

567
00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:10.958
I called it home.

568
00:26:10.958 --> 00:26:13.208
I meant what's the name of the city?

569
00:26:13.833 --> 00:26:15.125
I'm not gonna tell you.

570
00:26:15.458 --> 00:26:16.625
And why's that?

571
00:26:16.625 --> 00:26:19.250
Because I can't have the people there knowing I'm here.

572
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.625
Understand?

573
00:26:20.916 --> 00:26:22.833
How mysterious!

574
00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:25.333
Where'd you find this idiot?

575
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.916
You're not being very nice. Damian.

576
00:26:27.916 --> 00:26:29.833
I came here to be nice to you.

577
00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:31.875
Of course. Just being nice.

578
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.833
You wouldn't be trying to get back at me.

579
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.583
That wouldn't be very Christian.

580
00:26:39.041 --> 00:26:40.916
You know what that's about. right?

581
00:26:41.458 --> 00:26:42.916
What are you talking about?

582
00:26:43.375 --> 00:26:44.583
[chuckles]

583
00:26:46.208 --> 00:26:50.958
Looks like Megan went out and found herself the only guy at
church with a tattoo

584
00:26:50.958 --> 00:26:53.083
and brought him out to try to make me jealous.

585
00:26:53.083 --> 00:26:54.666
Oh. he is not from church.

586
00:26:54.666 --> 00:26:57.166
She's always complaining. you see...

587
00:26:57.708 --> 00:27:02.041
about how the only people she knows are from church or Bible
Club.

588
00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.916
It's convenient...

589
00:27:05.666 --> 00:27:07.291
that today...

590
00:27:07.458 --> 00:27:10.125
the last day before the tour...

591
00:27:10.916 --> 00:27:13.583
she finds herself a bad boy.

592
00:27:14.875 --> 00:27:17.333
You just don't know how to be civil. do you?

593
00:27:17.375 --> 00:27:19.916
If he's such a rebel why's he the only one not drinking?

594
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.125
Looks like my kindness isn't appreciated here.

595
00:27:23.291 --> 00:27:24.541
Let's go.

596
00:27:24.625 --> 00:27:25.916
Running scared.

597
00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:27.791
As usual.

598
00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:31.750
Happens every time she's cut to the quick by the sermonator.

599
00:27:31.791 --> 00:27:32.916
[chuckles]

600
00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.666
I could drink you under the table.

601
00:27:40.583 --> 00:27:41.458
What was that?

602
00:27:41.458 --> 00:27:42.625
You heard me.

603
00:27:46.041 --> 00:27:47.208
All right.

604
00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:50.875
Bad idea. He drinks a lot.

605
00:27:54.208 --> 00:27:55.541
Six pack sprint.

606
00:27:59.541 --> 00:28:00.708
Ladies...

607
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.208
you'll referee.

608
00:28:11.291 --> 00:28:13.791
First one to six empty shells wins.

609
00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:16.291
Starting in five...

610
00:28:17.083 --> 00:28:18.125
Four...

611
00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:19.541
Three...

612
00:28:20.625 --> 00:28:21.583
Two...

613
00:28:21.583 --> 00:28:27.875
[screaming]

614
00:28:33.333 --> 00:28:34.500
Uh...

615
00:28:34.833 --> 00:28:35.791
Okay.

616
00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:38.500
First round disqualification.

617
00:28:38.666 --> 00:28:40.916
Beer is for babies.

618
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.083
You want a duel?

619
00:28:44.916 --> 00:28:46.250
Let's do shots.

620
00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:53.208
Shots go down until someone doesn't get up.

621
00:28:53.416 --> 00:28:54.375
Got it?

622
00:28:56.416 --> 00:28:57.833
Is that all you got?

623
00:29:01.958 --> 00:29:03.958
I could drink that for breakfast.

624
00:29:04.541 --> 00:29:06.416
But it will be enough to take you down.

625
00:29:11.125 --> 00:30:21.041
♬

626
00:30:22.125 --> 00:30:24.208
Hey. you can't spit it out.

627
00:30:24.208 --> 00:30:24.916
What?

628
00:30:24.916 --> 00:30:26.833
I saw you spit it on your sleeve.

629
00:30:26.833 --> 00:30:28.000
No. I didn't.

630
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.833
Is that why you got your shirt wet?

631
00:30:29.833 --> 00:30:32.208
You thought you could spit 'em out and it would blend in?

632
00:30:32.208 --> 00:30:34.208
Are you calling me a cheater?

633
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.125
Yeah.

634
00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:37.083
Those are fightin' words.

635
00:30:37.083 --> 00:30:38.416
He can't fight.

636
00:30:39.208 --> 00:30:41.083
He's gotta stay pretty for the tour.

637
00:30:41.958 --> 00:30:43.916
But you knew that. didn't you?

638
00:30:45.458 --> 00:30:47.666
Well if I cheated. like I'm accused.

639
00:30:47.708 --> 00:30:50.041
then I'll have to prove myself some other way.

640
00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:54.500
Pick the game and I'll beat you.

641
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.416
How about a motorcycle race?

642
00:31:01.583 --> 00:31:02.750
On the roof.

643
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.541
Hit her.

644
00:31:05.958 --> 00:31:06.916
What?

645
00:31:07.583 --> 00:31:09.125
Hit her.

646
00:31:13.833 --> 00:31:14.916
No way.

647
00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:16.250
Not her.

648
00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:18.416
Her.

649
00:31:20.583 --> 00:31:21.916
What would that prove?

650
00:31:22.583 --> 00:31:24.583
That you're no choir boy.

651
00:31:26.583 --> 00:31:27.333
Damian --

652
00:31:27.333 --> 00:31:28.416
Don't worry.

653
00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:30.791
He won't do it.

654
00:31:30.958 --> 00:31:32.458
Cause he's scared.

655
00:31:32.458 --> 00:31:33.625
Let's go. Hambone.

656
00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:35.916
This is one of Damian's stupid mind games.

657
00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:38.833
You said you could beat me at any game.

658
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:40.833
Hit her.

659
00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:42.916
Or you lose.

660
00:31:43.375 --> 00:31:44.625
Hit her and you lose me.

661
00:31:44.625 --> 00:31:45.958
Which he knows you don't want.

662
00:31:45.958 --> 00:31:47.166
No. you won't lose her.

663
00:31:47.791 --> 00:31:48.666
She wants you to do it.

664
00:31:48.666 --> 00:31:49.500
No I don't.

665
00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:52.083
She won't admit it.

666
00:31:52.375 --> 00:31:54.625
But she's been wanting to hit her all night.

667
00:31:54.958 --> 00:31:56.208
Good night. Damian.

668
00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:01.666
A few drinks ago...

669
00:32:02.166 --> 00:32:03.583
I would have just said no.

670
00:32:04.958 --> 00:32:06.333
But that was a few drinks ago.

671
00:32:08.666 --> 00:32:09.916
Hold her steady.

672
00:32:10.958 --> 00:32:12.291
Don't do it. Hambone.

673
00:32:12.291 --> 00:32:26.250
♬

674
00:32:26.291 --> 00:32:26.958
Ow!

675
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.583
You asshole!

676
00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:33.291
Now I'm gonna have a fat lip for the pictures!

677
00:32:34.166 --> 00:32:36.125
It's okay. Maybe it will look tough.

678
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:37.208
That's not our look!

679
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.166
Get out of here. Both of you.

680
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:44.166
Did I win?

681
00:32:44.166 --> 00:32:44.958
Get out!

682
00:32:44.958 --> 00:32:45.916
[door opens]

683
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.541
Was that the kind of crazy you wanted?

684
00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.166
[laughs]

685
00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:00.333
So you didn't swallow any of it?

686
00:33:00.458 --> 00:33:01.166
No.

687
00:33:01.541 --> 00:33:02.291
I don't drink.

688
00:33:02.375 --> 00:33:03.625
Well how'd you learn to fake it?

689
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.083
My dad's always trying to get me to drink with him.

690
00:33:06.083 --> 00:33:09.541
So I learned that trick to keep him off my back.

691
00:33:09.791 --> 00:33:12.416
Wow. my dad won't even touch the stuff.

692
00:33:12.625 --> 00:33:16.458
Every time there's a beer commercial on TV he goes. "Lies.
All lies."

693
00:33:17.125 --> 00:33:18.708
Well. he's not wrong.

694
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.333
So what's up with you and Damian?

695
00:33:22.583 --> 00:33:24.250
We used to date.

696
00:33:24.708 --> 00:33:25.875
Yeah. well I figured that.

697
00:33:26.041 --> 00:33:28.708
But why would you date someone like him?

698
00:33:29.958 --> 00:33:31.958
It's hard to explain.

699
00:33:34.333 --> 00:33:35.541
I've got time.

700
00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:38.875
Growing up in the church. it's...

701
00:33:39.666 --> 00:33:40.500
different.

702
00:33:40.833 --> 00:33:43.625
There were things I couldn't talk to anyone about. but...

703
00:33:44.166 --> 00:33:45.458
I could talk to him.

704
00:33:46.541 --> 00:33:48.583
You couldn't talk to anyone at church?

705
00:33:52.166 --> 00:33:53.666
You should try another church.

706
00:33:54.125 --> 00:33:55.500
They're all the same.

707
00:33:55.791 --> 00:33:57.750
Everyone is so fake.

708
00:33:58.333 --> 00:34:01.666
It's like we're all in a show playing the role of 'Good
Christian' and...

709
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.833
it's exhausting.

710
00:34:05.916 --> 00:34:07.333
But do you believe it?

711
00:34:07.833 --> 00:34:09.541
God and Jesus and all that?

712
00:34:10.375 --> 00:34:11.291
I don't know.

713
00:34:12.041 --> 00:34:14.375
I mean. I don't want to hurt my family. but...

714
00:34:14.375 --> 00:34:16.250
I don't want to be like them. either.

715
00:34:17.708 --> 00:34:18.916
I want to be real.

716
00:34:19.666 --> 00:34:20.833
You know. like you.

717
00:34:21.708 --> 00:34:22.375
What?

718
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.250
The way you punched Damian.

719
00:34:24.541 --> 00:34:26.625
That is what real people do.

720
00:34:27.916 --> 00:34:29.000
He was right.

721
00:34:29.125 --> 00:34:32.250
About Jeannie. I wanted to hit her. but...

722
00:34:33.541 --> 00:34:35.208
Christians aren't supposed to fight.

723
00:34:35.416 --> 00:34:37.041
Only real people can do that.

724
00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:38.916
So was Damian real?

725
00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:40.291
Oh yeah.

726
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.416
Then why'd you break up?

727
00:34:43.375 --> 00:34:47.625
There was something that he wanted to do that a Christian
girl shouldn't.

728
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.166
He said he wouldn't tour without it.

729
00:34:52.125 --> 00:34:54.833
I said fine. but we'd have to get married first.

730
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:57.666
And he dumped me.

731
00:35:00.625 --> 00:35:02.250
I should have punched him harder.

[phone chimes]

734
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.208
What is it?

735
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:15.625
Damian posted something.

736
00:35:16.291 --> 00:35:17.375
A picture.

737
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.125
Of me. but it's fake.

738
00:35:21.833 --> 00:35:24.708
That is my face but that is not my body.

739
00:35:24.708 --> 00:35:25.750
Forget it.

740
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:26.791
The Internet's garbage.

741
00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:30.458
I know. That's why I always tried to make sure that
something like this didn't happen.

742
00:35:30.458 --> 00:35:33.166
I didn't want any scandal and Damian knows it.

743
00:35:33.166 --> 00:35:35.708
Well it doesn't seem like something church people would see.

744
00:35:36.041 --> 00:35:37.000
You don't know them.

745
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.041
They'll see it and they'll tell my dad.

746
00:35:40.125 --> 00:35:42.708
And each other. They'll tell everyone except for me.

747
00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:45.083
Well then tell them it's not you.

748
00:35:45.083 --> 00:35:46.916
It's too good of a photo edit to convince them of that.

749
00:35:46.916 --> 00:35:48.791
Then Damian has to say it's not you.

750
00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:52.041
How would we get him to do that?

751
00:35:53.375 --> 00:35:54.750
I have no idea.

752
00:35:56.041 --> 00:35:58.791
Well you came up with something easy enough back there.

753
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.666
Can't you just think of something else?

754
00:36:04.166 --> 00:36:05.083
What?

755
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:06.666
Nothing.

756
00:36:06.875 --> 00:36:08.208
You're smiling. What is it?

757
00:36:09.291 --> 00:36:10.666
It's something we shouldn't do.

758
00:36:10.791 --> 00:36:12.500
I'll be the judge of that.

759
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.041
So... their van's packed for the tour. right?

760
00:36:17.666 --> 00:36:19.583
But if it went missing...

761
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.375
You want to steal the van?

762
00:36:21.375 --> 00:36:22.875
No. I do not.

763
00:36:23.541 --> 00:36:25.083
But that's the idea.

764
00:36:25.083 --> 00:36:28.625
And then we wouldn't tell him where it was until he admitted
the picture was doctored.

765
00:36:29.416 --> 00:36:30.416
Let's do it.

766
00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.083
No. you're not thinking this through.

767
00:36:32.083 --> 00:36:33.166
What did I miss?

768
00:36:33.333 --> 00:36:36.208
With everything that's happened tonight. you'd be the first
suspect.

769
00:36:36.208 --> 00:36:37.458
No. you would.

770
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:42.333
That's why you'll do the illegal part and then when they ask
me about you I'll just tell them the truth.

771
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.125
I have no idea who you are.

772
00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:51.208
Hey Jeannie.

773
00:36:51.333 --> 00:36:52.125
[Jeannie] What?

774
00:36:52.708 --> 00:36:54.541
[Damian] Which one of our songs...

775
00:36:54.833 --> 00:36:57.833
would most likely make girls want to take their tops off?

776
00:36:58.416 --> 00:36:59.500
[Jeannie] I don't know.

777
00:36:59.625 --> 00:37:01.708
[Damian] If you had to choose just one.

778
00:37:02.416 --> 00:37:05.416
[Jeannie] I didn't know there were multiple songs. I just
thought it was one long one.

779
00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.208
[Damian] Come on.

780
00:37:07.208 --> 00:37:09.000
We gotta know which song to play first.

781
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.125

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.708
What?

785
00:38:03.833 --> 00:38:05.250
[Damian] What are you doing?

786
00:38:08.166 --> 00:38:09.708
Opening the windows.

787
00:38:09.916 --> 00:38:11.250
It stinks in here.

788
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.833
Girl's don't like that.

[clears throat]

795
00:38:39.916 --> 00:38:41.541
I thought you were gonna meet me at the park.

796
00:38:41.708 --> 00:38:44.666
I decided if you're not afraid to get in trouble. I
shouldn't be either.

797
00:38:45.166 --> 00:38:46.375
You inspire me.

Well this has been an enjoyable evening.

801
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.541
For sure.

802
00:39:30.375 --> 00:39:31.916
Damian never fought for me.

803
00:39:32.666 --> 00:39:33.958
Only with me.

804
00:39:34.416 --> 00:39:36.291
This is a whole new world.

805
00:39:36.458 --> 00:39:38.125
Well. I'm happy to do it.

806
00:39:38.791 --> 00:39:39.750
Anytime.

807
00:39:40.083 --> 00:39:41.375
Let me give you my number.

808
00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.958
I don't have a phone.

809
00:39:44.666 --> 00:39:46.125
What? Everyone has a phone.

810
00:39:46.291 --> 00:39:47.250
Not me.

811
00:39:47.666 --> 00:39:48.583
Why?

812
00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:52.125
I couldn't risk it falling into the wrong hands.

813
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:56.333
Anyway. let's just do like they did in the old days and...

814
00:39:56.791 --> 00:39:58.791
make a plan to see each other again.

815
00:39:59.458 --> 00:40:01.458
All right. What's the plan?

816
00:40:02.791 --> 00:40:04.750
Five PM tomorrow night at the park?

817
00:40:05.458 --> 00:40:06.791
It's a date.

818
00:40:08.125 --> 00:40:09.208
Well...

819
00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:10.708
see you then.

820
00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:12.875
Hey.

821
00:40:14.125 --> 00:40:14.916
Is that it?

00:40:16.416 --> 00:40:17.458
What do you mean?

823
00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:19.083
Are you just gonna go?

824
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:22.041
Well I think we've said all we should say.

825
00:40:22.041 --> 00:40:25.625
But have we done all we should do?

826
00:40:28.416 --> 00:40:29.291
Well I think so.

827
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:30.375
Drop the act.

00:40:32.125 --> 00:40:33.333

A dream come true.

834
00:40:50.541 --> 00:40:53.375
I don't remember walking home. I just remember how I felt.

835
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:56.458
It was the greatest sensation I'd ever had

836
00:40:56.541 --> 00:40:57.916
and nothing else mattered.

837
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.333
It didn't matter that she didn't know it was me.

838
00:41:01.333 --> 00:41:03.500
Because. after all. it was me.

839
00:41:03.625 --> 00:41:05.791
And it didn't matter what I had to do to get there.

840
00:41:05.916 --> 00:41:07.375
I skipped drama. So what?

841
00:41:07.375 --> 00:41:09.125
I punched Damian. He'll live.

842
00:41:09.125 --> 00:41:10.875
I stole a van.

843
00:41:12.875 --> 00:41:14.041
Wait a minute.

844
00:41:15.875 --> 00:41:16.875
I stole a van.

845
00:41:17.666 --> 00:41:19.583
I could get in huge trouble for that.

846
00:41:20.458 --> 00:41:22.208
But it wasn't me. It was Hambone.

847
00:41:22.958 --> 00:41:25.250
Could Hambone get in trouble if he doesn't exist?

848
00:41:25.791 --> 00:41:27.166
Hambone had my fingerprints.

849
00:41:28.291 --> 00:41:29.041
Oh crap.

850
00:41:29.791 --> 00:41:31.375
If I got caught I'd go to jail.

851
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:35.083
And get fired from the church and never work in ministry
again.

852
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.083
I had to fix this.

853

♬

854
00:41:38.458 --> 00:41:40.791
The police would be looking for someone with a face tattoo.

855
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:43.500
So I had to unsteal the van as myself.

856
00:41:48.333 --> 00:41:51.625
I knew if I got caught I'd have to explain why I was driving
a stolen van.

857
00:41:52.333 --> 00:41:54.083
To the police and to Megan.

858
00:41:54.833 --> 00:41:56.125
But I couldn't think of anything.

859
00:41:56.375 --> 00:41:59.375
Somehow when I was Hambone the stories just rolled off my
tongue.

860
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:02.375
But for Danny Doom. nothing came to mind.

861
00:42:03.166 --> 00:42:06.750
But I also knew no one would call the police if I returned
the van before the band woke up.

862
00:42:07.416 --> 00:42:09.958
With all the drinking they did. I thought I would have until
noon.

863
00:42:12.541 --> 00:42:13.833
But there they were.

864
00:42:17.041 --> 00:42:18.250
What?!

865
00:42:18.333 --> 00:42:22.083
The van was here the whole time. You woke us up for nothing.
Jeannie.

866
00:42:22.666 --> 00:42:24.875
No. it was stolen. Remember?

867
00:42:25.416 --> 00:42:26.208
Yeah.

868
00:42:26.208 --> 00:42:29.041
That's why we were out looking for it all morning.

869
00:42:30.458 --> 00:42:31.625
Hey guys.

870
00:42:33.208 --> 00:42:34.833
I found your van!

871
00:42:35.416 --> 00:42:36.666
Why'd you take it?

872
00:42:36.791 --> 00:42:40.000
Uh. I didn't take it. I just...

873
00:42:40.875 --> 00:42:41.750
found it.

874
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:42.875
Out in the woods.

875
00:42:42.875 --> 00:42:46.583
Where you just happened to be at the butt-crack of dawn?

876
00:42:47.375 --> 00:42:48.750
Yeah. I uh...

877
00:42:49.208 --> 00:42:51.791
I like to take walks in the woods early.

878
00:42:52.666 --> 00:42:54.416
Before it gets crowded.

879
00:42:54.916 --> 00:42:57.875
How'd you know it was ours? Magic?

880
00:43:00.666 --> 00:43:03.750
Well I knew you guys were leaving on tour today and I saw
the band gear

881
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.916
and put two and two together.

882
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.000
You know our band?

883
00:43:08.458 --> 00:43:09.750
Yeah. I follow you.

884
00:43:10.375 --> 00:43:11.250
Online.

885
00:43:11.416 --> 00:43:12.208
Whoa.

886
00:43:13.083 --> 00:43:14.250
We're famous.

887
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.375
No you're not.

888
00:43:15.583 --> 00:43:17.708
You followed him. didn't you?

889
00:43:18.125 --> 00:43:18.875
Who?

890
00:43:19.041 --> 00:43:20.500
Megan's new boyfriend.

891
00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.750
The one who stole the van.

892
00:43:21.875 --> 00:43:23.125
He stole the van.

893
00:43:23.541 --> 00:43:25.375
Does he look like a van thief to you?

894
00:43:26.166 --> 00:43:27.875
How do you know the other guy took it?

895
00:43:28.916 --> 00:43:32.333
Because he's the type who gets mad when you insult his girl.

896
00:43:32.375 --> 00:43:34.458
And this is the type that wishes he was that type.

897
00:43:34.916 --> 00:43:36.208
Look...

898
00:43:36.208 --> 00:43:38.666
the van's back so everything's fine now.

899
00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:40.208
I'm just gonna go.

900
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.458
Are you one of Megan's boy toys?

901
00:43:44.583 --> 00:43:46.041
I know Megan.

902
00:43:46.125 --> 00:43:47.083
How?

903
00:43:47.916 --> 00:43:49.791
We were in a club together at school.

904
00:43:50.541 --> 00:43:51.916
I've heard of this club.

905
00:43:52.291 --> 00:43:54.541
It's where everyone's drooling in their Bible's over her.

906
00:43:55.166 --> 00:43:56.583
I wouldn't say that.

907
00:43:57.291 --> 00:43:58.666
Did she put you up to this?

908
00:44:01.416 --> 00:44:03.041
Why would she do that?

909
00:44:03.583 --> 00:44:05.625
Because that's how she is.

910
00:44:06.458 --> 00:44:10.500
She'll joyride all night with the bad boy. But in the
morning...

911
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.791
comes regret.

912
00:44:12.041 --> 00:44:14.875
So she confesses to 'friend-zone-Freddie' over here.

913
00:44:15.166 --> 00:44:16.583
Who takes the bait.

914
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.333
And offers to fix it for her.

915
00:44:20.208 --> 00:44:22.208
She never could decide who she wants to be.

916
00:44:23.791 --> 00:44:24.666
Oh well.

917
00:44:25.541 --> 00:44:27.083
She's someone else's problem now.

918
00:44:27.083 --> 00:44:28.541
So what about him?

919
00:44:32.875 --> 00:44:34.208
Forget him.

920
00:44:34.833 --> 00:44:37.208
Pining for Megan's torture enough.

921
00:44:40.916 --> 00:44:41.750
Hey!

922
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.916
If she helped steal the van. like you say. then...

923
00:44:46.916 --> 00:44:49.000
she had you in a bad spot. don't you think?

924
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:55.166
I mean she could have demanded you take that picture down
before you got the van back but she didn't.

925
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.875
Bad move for her.

926
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.416
To show you kindness?

927
00:44:59.583 --> 00:45:01.791
Bad move for you to not show any back.

928
00:45:02.791 --> 00:45:04.833
What are you gonna do about it. Freddie?

929
00:45:07.416 --> 00:45:09.583
Remind you of your guilt-stained conscience.

930
00:45:11.166 --> 00:45:14.083
That you ruined a nice girl's life...

931
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.291
just because she wouldn't sleep with you.

932
00:45:22.708 --> 00:45:23.625
All right.

933
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:24.875
Fine.

934
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:28.791
Tell her that thing's gonna go away.

935
00:45:29.208 --> 00:45:31.250
And tell her to make up her mind.

936
00:45:34.583 --> 00:45:36.458
[narrator] He took the picture down after that.

937
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:40.125
Said it was all a joke and made fun of those who thought it
was really her.

938
00:45:40.458 --> 00:45:42.375
Everyone said. "Good move. Damian!"

939
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.083
But he didn't save the day.

940
00:45:44.083 --> 00:45:45.125
I did.

941
00:45:45.125 --> 00:45:46.375
Danny Do.

942
00:45:46.666 --> 00:45:47.958
But no one knew.

943
00:45:48.958 --> 00:45:49.666
[knocks]

944
00:45:49.708 --> 00:45:50.625
Howdy. Danny.

945
00:45:50.833 --> 00:45:51.833
Hey. Pastor.

946
00:45:53.833 --> 00:45:54.916
So...

947
00:45:55.541 --> 00:45:57.000
how do you like your new office?

948
00:45:57.625 --> 00:45:58.666
Is that what this is?

949
00:45:58.666 --> 00:45:59.083
[chuckles]

950
00:45:59.083 --> 00:46:01.958
Well. believe it or not. my first office was worse than this
one.

951
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.166
Say. um...

952
00:46:07.041 --> 00:46:08.416
what happened last night?

953
00:46:10.791 --> 00:46:12.000
What do you mean?

954
00:46:13.583 --> 00:46:16.250
The drama team said you left before the performance.

955
00:46:16.875 --> 00:46:17.750
Oh... that.

956
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:19.250
Yeah. um...

957
00:46:20.416 --> 00:46:24.333
there was a situation and I couldn't go on.

958
00:46:25.291 --> 00:46:26.958
The church was quite disappointed.

959
00:46:26.958 --> 00:46:28.333
It won't happen again.

960
00:46:29.583 --> 00:46:30.583
All right.

961
00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:38.500
So if you didn't do the drama. you must have had some extra
time on your hands.

962
00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:41.125
Yeah.

963
00:46:42.625 --> 00:46:44.333
Care to share how you filled it?

964
00:46:47.541 --> 00:46:51.541
If there's something specific you want to ask me. Pastor.
feel free.

965
00:46:52.708 --> 00:46:54.333
I thought it would be obvious.

966
00:46:55.125 --> 00:46:56.833
Not until you tell me.

967
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:58.458
Okay.

968
00:47:00.458 --> 00:47:05.666
I'd like to know why there's a picture of you on the
Internet with a stolen van.

969
00:47:09.166 --> 00:47:10.500
I didn't know that.

970
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.375
Everybody's been posting it.

971
00:47:16.083 --> 00:47:17.166
What happened?

972
00:47:19.291 --> 00:47:21.333
Danny. we need to talk about this.

973
00:47:21.333 --> 00:47:24.333
I'd rather not. Just do whatever you have to do.

974
00:47:25.041 --> 00:47:28.041
What I have to do is get the full story.

975
00:47:28.666 --> 00:47:33.625
After all. it's not every day someone on my staff turns out
to be...

976
00:47:34.166 --> 00:47:35.583
a hero.

977
00:47:36.041 --> 00:47:39.875
If you hadn't found that van that band's whole tour would
have been ruined.

978
00:47:40.541 --> 00:47:41.791
Did you know that?

979
00:47:43.291 --> 00:47:45.583
Just look at what they said about you.

980
00:47:45.916 --> 00:47:49.708
"Last night. van and gear were stolen by some ass..."

981
00:47:50.291 --> 00:47:51.208
Mean person.

982
00:47:51.833 --> 00:47:54.791
"Who tried to ruin the tour.

983
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:58.583
But day was saved when Freddie here found and returned the
van."

984
00:47:58.958 --> 00:48:00.208
Why do they call you 'Freddie'?

985
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.250
That's just a friendly nickname they gave me.

986
00:48:04.958 --> 00:48:05.875
Hm.

987
00:48:05.875 --> 00:48:08.250
"Now we're loaded and on our way to Portland.

988
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:10.916
and that sack of... can suck..."

989
00:48:10.916 --> 00:48:13.916
The rest is just their opinion of the person who stole the
van.

990
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:16.750
So how'd you find it?

991
00:48:18.166 --> 00:48:20.250
It just sort of... happened.

992
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.958
How?

993
00:48:23.416 --> 00:48:26.125
I was walking through the woods and there it was.

994
00:48:26.791 --> 00:48:28.958
Since when do you go walking in the woods?

995
00:48:29.625 --> 00:48:31.333
Since this morning.

996
00:48:31.333 --> 00:48:32.916
Well what inspired that?

997
00:48:38.875 --> 00:48:40.166
God.

998
00:48:41.708 --> 00:48:42.833
Really?

999
00:48:42.833 --> 00:48:46.583
Yeah. Oh yeah. it was all God.

1000
00:48:46.791 --> 00:48:49.208
Why not just come out and say it?

1001
00:48:49.208 --> 00:48:51.208
This isn't something to be shy about.

1002
00:48:51.208 --> 00:48:54.166
I guess I just didn't want to say too much because...

1003
00:48:54.166 --> 00:48:56.666
I didn't want people thinking that I stole the van.

1004
00:48:56.666 --> 00:48:57.916
You? Steal a van?

1005
00:48:57.916 --> 00:48:58.583
[laughs]

1006
00:48:58.583 --> 00:49:00.791
You don't have to worry about anyone thinking that.

1007
00:49:01.208 --> 00:49:05.666
But you do have to worry about the attention you'll get when
I tell everyone this was you.

1008
00:49:05.666 --> 00:49:07.166
You don't have to do that.

1009
00:49:07.166 --> 00:49:09.708
Giving glory to God instead of taking the credit.

1010
00:49:09.708 --> 00:49:13.250
That's exactly the kind of unselfishness I've been talking
about.

1011
00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:14.833
Attaway. Danny Do.

1012
00:49:14.833 --> 00:49:17.916
So. like you said. I probably shouldn't get any credit.

1013
00:49:17.916 --> 00:49:21.958
And that humility is what convinced me you can handle it.

1014
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:27.041
People pay far more attention to what you do than what you
say.

1015
00:49:27.416 --> 00:49:32.083
This act of kindness could lead more to the Lord than a
thousand church dramas.

1016
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:35.208
Cause it's not just a story.

1017
00:49:36.458 --> 00:49:37.833
It's real.

1018
00:49:43.083 --> 00:49:45.041
Hey Danny. right? From church?

1019
00:49:45.041 --> 00:49:46.791
That was awesome what you did!

1020
00:49:46.791 --> 00:49:48.833
It's nice seeing a young person doing the right thing.

1021
00:49:48.833 --> 00:49:51.500
[narrator] The attention made me extremely uncomfortable.

1022
00:49:51.708 --> 00:49:52.541
Oh hey. Danny!

1023
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:53.708
We heard about the van.

1024
00:49:53.708 --> 00:49:54.458
Ah. it was nothing.

1025
00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:55.375
[narrator] At first.

1026
00:49:55.375 --> 00:49:56.625
I just found it out in the woods.

1027
00:49:56.625 --> 00:49:57.250
That's amazing.

1028
00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.583
[narrator] But then it grew on me.

1029
00:49:58.583 --> 00:49:59.458
Thank you.

1030
00:49:59.458 --> 00:50:00.875
We've been hearing about you at church!

1031
00:50:00.875 --> 00:50:03.500
[narrator] I started to see why popularity was so popular.

1032
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.250
That's so nice of you.

1033
00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:05.041
Well thank you guys.

1034
00:50:05.041 --> 00:50:05.875
[narrator] It felt good.

1035
00:50:05.875 --> 00:50:07.125
Hey guys! That's Danny!

1036
00:50:07.125 --> 00:50:08.333
Are you serious? Danny!

1037
00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:10.333
And there was this big light that came down...

1038
00:50:10.333 --> 00:50:12.458
And it's the day of their tour. you guys.

1039
00:50:12.458 --> 00:50:13.166
No way!

1040
00:50:13.166 --> 00:50:14.458
And why shouldn't I be popular?

1041
00:50:14.875 --> 00:50:17.375
I did a good thing. I brought the van back.

1042
00:50:17.958 --> 00:50:19.500
Who cares how it was stolen?

1043
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.958
[narrator] I heard from everyone I knew that day.

1044
00:50:22.666 --> 00:50:24.458
Except the one I wanted to hear from most.

1045
00:50:25.166 --> 00:50:27.375
She didn't comment or like any of the posts.

1046
00:50:27.583 --> 00:50:28.791
And I checked them all.

1047
00:50:29.583 --> 00:50:31.166
Couldn't she see what was happening here?

1048
00:50:31.166 --> 00:50:33.500
And wasn't she happy that Damian took the picture down?

1049
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.583
And that it was all resolved peacefully?

1050
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:36.583
By me?

1051
00:50:36.791 --> 00:50:38.208
Did she know about that?

1052
00:50:38.916 --> 00:50:40.000
I had to find out.

1053
00:50:41.208 --> 00:50:42.041
Hey Megan.

1054
00:50:44.208 --> 00:50:45.291
Did you hear the news?

1055
00:50:47.875 --> 00:50:50.083
I found Damian's van and brought it back.

1056
00:50:50.333 --> 00:50:51.875
And he took down that picture.

1057
00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:55.541
So everything's good now.

1058
00:50:58.291 --> 00:51:00.458
There's been a lot of chatter online about it.

1059
00:51:03.333 --> 00:51:04.291
Isn't that great?

1060
00:51:04.541 --> 00:51:06.291
I told you I didn't want to see you again.

1061
00:51:06.625 --> 00:51:08.791
I know. I um... I just...

1062
00:51:10.041 --> 00:51:11.875
thought this would be news you would want to hear.

1063
00:51:12.125 --> 00:51:14.791
I already heard that news and it was not what I wanted to
hear.

1064
00:51:14.875 --> 00:51:16.583
But I got him to take down the picture.

1065
00:51:16.583 --> 00:51:18.958
I didn't ask you to do that. I asked you to leave me alone.

1066
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:20.333
But --

1067
00:51:20.333 --> 00:51:21.583
Goodbye.

1068
00:51:23.916 --> 00:51:26.375
[narrator] How could she love Hambone and hate Danny?

1069
00:51:26.958 --> 00:51:28.458
Couldn't she see Danny was cool?

1070
00:51:29.166 --> 00:51:31.125
Maybe not before. but he was now.

1071
00:51:31.666 --> 00:51:33.916
Everyone else saw it. Why not her?

1072
00:51:34.666 --> 00:51:35.958
Something had to be done.

1073
00:51:36.458 --> 00:51:39.083
Hambone was going to see Megan with one thing on his mind.

1074
00:51:39.416 --> 00:51:41.375
Convince her Danny is cool.

1075
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:43.375
Hey.

1076
00:51:44.083 --> 00:51:44.833
Take it easy.

1077
00:51:44.833 --> 00:51:46.583
[narrator] Okay. maybe two things on his mind.

1078
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:48.458
But we kissed last night. so...

1079
00:51:48.791 --> 00:51:50.875
You're acting like that was your first time.

1080
00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:53.375
You made me feel like it was.

1081
00:51:54.666 --> 00:51:58.125
But anyway. I saw Damian took that picture down.

1082
00:51:58.333 --> 00:51:59.958
I thought you didn't have a phone.

1083
00:52:00.708 --> 00:52:01.500
I stole one.

1084
00:52:02.291 --> 00:52:03.500
A glance at one. Anyway.

1085
00:52:03.666 --> 00:52:05.916
I guess we should return his van now. right?

1086
00:52:06.208 --> 00:52:07.375
Someone already did.

1087
00:52:07.875 --> 00:52:08.416
What?

1088
00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:09.916
Did you tell anyone where we hid it?

1089
00:52:10.083 --> 00:52:10.666
No.

1090
00:52:11.416 --> 00:52:12.541
Well some guy found it.

1091
00:52:13.125 --> 00:52:14.083
He ruined everything.

1092
00:52:14.458 --> 00:52:16.583
But Damian still took the picture down?

1093
00:52:16.708 --> 00:52:19.083
Yeah. He talked him in to it somehow.

1094
00:52:19.541 --> 00:52:21.291
Then I guess we should thank him.

1095
00:52:21.458 --> 00:52:22.500
For meddling?

1096
00:52:23.333 --> 00:52:27.333
For de-escalating the situation and still getting everyone
what they wanted.

1097
00:52:27.708 --> 00:52:29.166
He sounds pretty cool to me.

1098
00:52:29.458 --> 00:52:32.791
I didn't want Damian to back down. I wanted to fight him and
win.

1099
00:52:34.416 --> 00:52:35.541
Now I can't.

1100
00:52:35.708 --> 00:52:36.875
But you can't lose. either.

1101
00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:39.000
What did this guy say to Damian?

1102
00:52:39.416 --> 00:52:40.416
What's it matter?

1103
00:52:40.708 --> 00:52:44.125
It must have been something pretty compelling to get him to
throw in the towel like that.

1104
00:52:45.208 --> 00:52:46.375
I guess he spooked him.

1105
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:48.708
He does have that effect on people.

1106
00:52:49.291 --> 00:52:51.250
Come on. You gotta give this guy a little credit.

1107
00:52:51.416 --> 00:52:53.000
You sound like you want to meet him.

1108
00:52:53.375 --> 00:52:54.208
Nah.

1109
00:52:54.458 --> 00:52:56.125
I can admire from afar.

1110
00:52:56.291 --> 00:52:57.958
Well. you might meet him anyway.

1111
00:52:58.083 --> 00:52:59.666
He's been following me.

1112
00:52:59.958 --> 00:53:02.000
He could be here right now for all I know.

1113
00:53:05.291 --> 00:53:09.708
Neither of us told anyone where the van was so the only way
that he could have known is if he followed us.

1114
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.333
Couldn't he have just found it out in the woods?

1115
00:53:12.333 --> 00:53:14.916
I'd believe that if he hadn't already been following me.

1116
00:53:14.916 --> 00:53:16.166
What's wrong with that?

1117
00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:17.416
I mean...

1118
00:53:17.416 --> 00:53:18.375
I follow you.

1119
00:53:18.375 --> 00:53:21.375
Yeah. but that's different. This guy he's like obsessed.

1120
00:53:21.375 --> 00:53:23.916
So he really. really likes you.

1121
00:53:24.291 --> 00:53:26.791
Don't you think someone should really. really like you?

1122
00:53:26.791 --> 00:53:28.000
Not like this.

1123
00:53:28.166 --> 00:53:30.416
He's like some kid brother who doesn't know how annoying he
is.

1124
00:53:30.416 --> 00:53:32.791
Who does annoying things like save your reputation?

1125
00:53:32.791 --> 00:53:34.458
Which he did purely out of self-interest.

1126
00:53:34.458 --> 00:53:35.041
How do you know?

1127
00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:37.791
Because he showed up at my doorstep to tell me about it.

1128
00:53:37.791 --> 00:53:41.791
And that's not all. He told everyone that God led him to the
van.

1129
00:53:41.916 --> 00:53:44.000
And of course all the crazy Christians believed him.

1130
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.625
So now he's their hero when all he did was stalk me.

1131
00:53:48.833 --> 00:53:50.166
It's pathetic.

1132
00:53:55.083 --> 00:53:56.708
So. um...

1133
00:53:57.916 --> 00:53:59.750
What should he have done instead?

1134
00:54:00.583 --> 00:54:01.500
Nothing.

1135
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:03.958
Left me alone.

1136
00:54:04.875 --> 00:54:07.125
But he just keeps coming back.

1137
00:54:08.833 --> 00:54:11.500
He probably thinks God wants us to be together somehow.

1138
00:54:14.708 --> 00:54:15.958
Crazy.

1139
00:54:18.625 --> 00:54:20.083
How do you know it's not true?

1140
00:54:21.708 --> 00:54:22.958
Why are you defending him?

1141
00:54:22.958 --> 00:54:26.458
You said you weren't sure what you believe so how are you
sure about this?

1142
00:54:26.666 --> 00:54:29.000
Are you worried he's gonna steal me away from you?

1143
00:54:30.083 --> 00:54:31.041
Don't be.

1144
00:54:31.583 --> 00:54:34.291
I know what I believe about who I want to spend my time
with.

1145
00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:40.333
Look. thinking about him gives me the creeps. Can we talk
about something else?

1146
00:54:40.833 --> 00:54:41.791
Fine by me.

1147
00:54:42.541 --> 00:54:43.916
What do you want to do tonight?

1148
00:54:44.625 --> 00:54:45.916
I didn't plan anything.

1149
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:48.583
That seemed to work pretty well last time.

1150
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:51.208
Got any more ex-boyfriend's for me to deal with?

1151
00:54:52.666 --> 00:54:53.708
No...

1152
00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:56.666
But you should talk to Danny.

1153
00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:59.083
Who's Danny?

1154
00:54:59.083 --> 00:55:00.958
The guy I've been talking about.

1155
00:55:01.375 --> 00:55:04.125
I thought you said you didn't want to talk about him
anymore.

1156
00:55:04.416 --> 00:55:07.625
I don't. but... you can help me get rid of him.

1157
00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:09.416
How?

1158
00:55:10.291 --> 00:55:11.250
Confront him.

1159
00:55:13.458 --> 00:55:15.500
This is your business. Not mine.

1160
00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.000
That didn't stop you last night.

1161
00:55:17.166 --> 00:55:18.625
Come on. think of all the fun we had.

1162
00:55:18.625 --> 00:55:19.916
Why can't you just talk to him?

1163
00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:21.083
I have. He won't listen.

1164
00:55:21.083 --> 00:55:22.916
Well then it doesn't seem like he'll listen to me.

1165
00:55:22.916 --> 00:55:25.166
Oh he will. Because you'll beat him up if he doesn't.

1166
00:55:25.166 --> 00:55:27.583
Well it doesn't seem like he's done anything to deserve
that.

1167
00:55:27.583 --> 00:55:30.000
You don't know him. and I'm telling you he deserves it.

1168
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:30.708
Why?

1169
00:55:30.708 --> 00:55:32.916
Because he can't just do whatever he wants.

1170
00:55:32.916 --> 00:55:34.875
I get to decide who I want to be with.

1171
00:55:34.875 --> 00:55:37.625
Not him. Not my dad. Not anybody but me.

1172
00:55:37.833 --> 00:55:40.083
He doesn't seem to understand that.

1173
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:45.833
And you want me to talk to him?

1174
00:55:45.958 --> 00:55:46.708
Yes.

1175
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:49.500
Because it would put me in a fantastic mood.

1176
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:53.958
[knocks]

1177
00:56:00.583 --> 00:56:01.791
[knocks]

1178
00:56:06.625 --> 00:56:08.416
[knocks]

1179
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:12.041
Well. looks like he's not home.

1180
00:56:12.208 --> 00:56:13.208
Then we wait.

1181
00:56:13.833 --> 00:56:15.708
You want to just stand here waiting for him?

1182
00:56:16.166 --> 00:56:16.958
Yep.

1183
00:56:18.166 --> 00:56:19.583
That doesn't sound like fun.

1184
00:56:20.125 --> 00:56:22.208
The look on his face will be worth it.

1185
00:56:26.708 --> 00:56:27.833
Maybe he's scared already.

1186
00:56:28.958 --> 00:56:30.166
He could be hiding in there.

1187
00:56:31.666 --> 00:56:32.583
Hello?

1188
00:56:32.583 --> 00:56:33.458
What are you doing?

1189
00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:35.000
Anybody home?

1190
00:56:35.541 --> 00:56:36.666
You can't just go in.

1191
00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:39.958
Come on out. Danny. We just want to talk to you.

1192
00:56:42.125 --> 00:56:42.458
[claps]

1193
00:56:42.458 --> 00:56:43.041
Hey!

1194
00:56:43.041 --> 00:56:44.458
We shouldn't be in here.

1195
00:56:44.458 --> 00:56:46.250
What are you so afraid of?

1196
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:55.208
Looks like this is his room.

1197
00:56:56.375 --> 00:56:57.666
Is it how you pictured it?

1198
00:56:57.666 --> 00:56:59.291
I hadn't pictured it.

1199
00:57:00.791 --> 00:57:04.416
The way you described him I thought we'd see some psycho
stuff. but...

1200
00:57:04.958 --> 00:57:06.791
He seems pretty normal.

1201
00:57:09.625 --> 00:57:12.625
Looks like he's been doing some pretty serious Bible study.

1202
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:15.916
Yeah. he loves to show off how much he knows about the
Bible.

1203
00:57:15.916 --> 00:57:17.083
That's a bad thing?

1204
00:57:17.416 --> 00:57:18.666
Knowing the Bible?

1205
00:57:19.416 --> 00:57:21.333
I'm just trying to understand your world.

1206
00:57:21.583 --> 00:57:22.666
Don't forget why we're here.

1207
00:57:22.666 --> 00:57:25.666
I know. But I might as well get to know him a little better.

1208
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.125
Why? So you and him can be buddies?

1209
00:57:28.125 --> 00:57:30.041
♬ "Oh... this American Dream..."

1210
00:57:30.041 --> 00:57:31.958
He does have good taste in music.

1211
00:57:31.958 --> 00:57:34.083
Trust me. you and him have nothing in common.

1212
00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:34.875
[clicks]

1213
00:57:39.333 --> 00:57:41.000
Are you sure you want to do this?

1214
00:57:41.041 --> 00:57:43.125
Yes. Why are you trying to talk me out of it?

1215
00:57:43.208 --> 00:57:45.875
What if there's complications?

1216
00:57:45.875 --> 00:57:46.875
Like?

1217
00:57:47.041 --> 00:57:48.333
What if he tries to fight me?

1218
00:57:48.333 --> 00:57:50.875
[laughs] Yeah. right. He'd never do that.

1219
00:57:50.875 --> 00:57:51.958
Won't he be mad?

1220
00:57:51.958 --> 00:57:53.750
Yeah. but he's weak.

1221
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:59.166
Looks like he works out.

1222
00:57:59.166 --> 00:58:01.666
Even if he had the arms. he does not have the guts.

1223
00:58:01.708 --> 00:58:03.250
How do you know all this about him?

1224
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:05.166
Because church boys are all the same.

1225
00:58:08.208 --> 00:58:11.083
Look. I don't want to hang out in his room. Let's go back
outside.

1226
00:58:11.083 --> 00:58:11.583
Why?

1227
00:58:11.583 --> 00:58:12.958
Because this is weird.

1228
00:58:13.208 --> 00:58:15.875
Are you uncomfortable because we're breaking the rules?

1229
00:58:16.041 --> 00:58:17.958
If you care to join me. I will be outside.

1230
00:58:20.208 --> 00:58:21.958
Okay. okay. Fine.

1231
00:58:23.541 --> 00:58:24.291
Thank you.

1232
00:58:26.208 --> 00:58:26.833
Hey.

1233
00:58:28.041 --> 00:58:29.541
Looks like he left his phone.

1234
00:58:32.375 --> 00:58:33.791
We could record a message.

1235
00:58:35.041 --> 00:58:36.916
We'd have to make sure he sees it.

1236
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.875
He seems like the kind of guy who checks his phone a lot.

1237
00:58:41.583 --> 00:58:45.083
What's up. Danny? You don't know me. but I know you.

1238
00:58:45.416 --> 00:58:47.333
I'm getting to know you real well here in your room.

1239
00:58:48.166 --> 00:58:50.041
You know who's never gonna be in your room?

1240
00:58:50.625 --> 00:58:51.500
Megan.

1241
00:58:51.708 --> 00:58:54.208
Because she doesn't want to be with you. understand?

1242
00:58:54.666 --> 00:58:56.791
She thinks you're a joke.

1243
00:58:57.083 --> 00:58:59.250
So if you don't leave her alone. you're gonna get hurt.

1244
00:58:59.625 --> 00:59:00.500
By me.

1245
00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:02.708
Tomorrow night.

1246
00:59:03.291 --> 00:59:05.583
Because I'm challenging you to a fight.

1247
00:59:05.833 --> 00:59:09.125
Five PM. At the park. Be there.

1248
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:10.833
If you're not afraid.

1249
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:12.625
What was that?

1250
00:59:12.625 --> 00:59:14.250
♬

1251
00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:15.416
[narrator] The plan was simple.

1252
00:59:15.708 --> 00:59:17.000
Danny shows up for the fight.

1253
00:59:17.208 --> 00:59:18.125
Hambone doesn't.

1254
00:59:18.666 --> 00:59:19.625
Danny wins.

1255
00:59:19.833 --> 00:59:22.875
When you insult someone like that you have to give him a
chance to fight back.

1256
00:59:22.875 --> 00:59:24.208
It's the right thing to do.

1257
00:59:24.208 --> 00:59:26.916
Well that's not what I wanted you to do. Let's do it again
without that part.

1258
00:59:26.916 --> 00:59:27.791
No.

1259
00:59:27.791 --> 00:59:31.125
If he's as weak as you say what do you have to be worried
about?

1260
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:38.291
What are you doing?

1261
00:59:38.666 --> 00:59:41.166
Texting it to him. Making sure he sees it.

1262
00:59:41.875 --> 00:59:42.416
Oh.

1263
00:59:43.583 --> 00:59:47.416
Well make sure it goes to just him cause I don't want my
face on the Internet.

1264
00:59:48.583 --> 00:59:52.875
You were supposed to get rid of him. Not challenge him. Do
you want him to fight you?

1265
00:59:52.875 --> 00:59:54.291
It'd be an interesting twist.

1266
00:59:54.375 --> 00:59:56.666
Yeah. especially since you seem to like him so much.

1267
00:59:56.791 --> 00:59:57.333
Look.

1268
00:59:58.375 --> 01:00:00.291
The things you say about him...

1269
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:04.166
there was a time when people talked about me like that.

1270
01:00:05.291 --> 01:00:06.750
When I found out...

1271
01:00:07.958 --> 01:00:09.000
it sucked.

1272
01:00:10.166 --> 01:00:12.166
So I don't like doing that to someone else.

1273
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.375
But was it true? What they said?

1274
01:00:16.791 --> 01:00:17.541
No.

1275
01:00:21.416 --> 01:00:23.708
There was a side of me that they hadn't seen yet.

1276
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.541
I hadn't seen it either until it happened.

1277
01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:31.041
Well I'm glad you've changed but Danny hasn't.

1278
01:00:35.458 --> 01:00:36.250
I should go.

1279
01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:38.208
I gotta...

1280
01:00:39.041 --> 01:00:40.166
get ready for the fight.

1281
01:00:41.291 --> 01:00:42.291
Are you afraid?

1282
01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:45.250
Maybe.

1283
01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:47.875
He could be tougher than he seems.

1284
01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:49.208
Not of him. of me.

1285
01:00:50.333 --> 01:00:51.916
Learning about who you really are.

1286
01:00:53.458 --> 01:00:54.666
You can talk to me.

1287
01:00:55.791 --> 01:00:57.625
Because I'm not afraid.

1288
01:00:58.666 --> 01:01:01.166
There's nothing that you could say that would scare me away
now.

1289
01:01:04.916 --> 01:01:06.458
You don't know what you're saying.

1290
01:01:07.916 --> 01:01:08.875
I gotta go.

1291
01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.416
My mind's on the fight tomorrow.

1292
01:01:12.666 --> 01:01:13.541
See you there?

1293
01:01:15.041 --> 01:01:15.666
Yeah.

1294
01:01:16.291 --> 01:01:17.375
Yeah. I'll be there.

1295
01:01:20.083 --> 01:01:20.875
Hey.

1296
01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:25.083
Don't I get another goodnight kiss?

1297
01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:29.041
You're acting like that was your first time.

1299
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.416
Goodbye. Hambone.

01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:43.666
I wish I never was you.

1303
01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:51.541
What's up. Beau?

1304
01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:52.500
Are you gonna do it?

1305
01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:53.875
Do what?

1306
01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:57.458
You totally shouldn't. It's not what we're supposed to do.
But it would be cool if you did!

1307
01:01:57.458 --> 01:01:58.458
Are you gonna?

1308
01:01:58.458 --> 01:01:59.416
Gonna what?

1309
01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:00.541
Fight that guy.

1310
01:02:00.833 --> 01:02:03.833
The one who wants to fight you over Megan. Didn't you see
the video?

1311
01:02:04.958 --> 01:02:07.125
You might get a few punches in. You lift weights. right?

1312
01:02:07.875 --> 01:02:11.958
[narrator] In an hour the video that was supposed to go to
just me had been seen by everyone.

1313
01:02:12.458 --> 01:02:13.708
She posted it.

1314

1315
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.166
Hey there. Danny Do.

1316
01:02:40.833 --> 01:02:41.708
Hey. Pastor.

1317
01:02:42.833 --> 01:02:45.291
Looks like everyone's talking about you again.

1318
01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:48.375
So...

1319
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.041
How are you feeling about it?

1320
01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:51.833
Fine.

1321
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.791
That guy said some mean things.

1322
01:02:57.708 --> 01:02:59.500
I hope you're not taking it to heart.

1323
01:03:02.541 --> 01:03:04.416
He's kind of hard to ignore.

1324
01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:09.583
Well just remember that people like him do not define you.

1325
01:03:10.583 --> 01:03:12.416
Fighting doesn't prove anything.

1326
01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:15.541
Then why does everyone do it?

1327
01:03:15.916 --> 01:03:19.416
Because they don't know the peace they could have in Christ
Jesus.

1328
01:03:22.958 --> 01:03:24.791
Thanks for the encouragement. Pastor.

1329
01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:26.625
I should get back to work.

1330
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.583
You sure you're okay?

1331
01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:31.708
Yes. Very sure.

1332
01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:36.708
I don't know. You still seem kind of down to me.

1333
01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:41.250
How about we raise your spirits by seeing a movie tonight?

1334
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.333
Um...

1335
01:03:45.916 --> 01:03:47.041
I have plans.

1336
01:03:48.333 --> 01:03:49.291
To do what?

1337
01:03:53.666 --> 01:03:55.416
I hope you don't mean the fight.

1338
01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.958
Danny. don't.

1339
01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:00.375
I can't just skip it.

1340
01:04:00.375 --> 01:04:03.375
Yes. you can. He does not control you.

1341
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:05.958
But shouldn't I defend myself?

1342
01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:09.500
He's not attacking you out of the blue. He's giving you a
choice.

1343
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.291
And fighting is the wrong one.

1344
01:04:11.291 --> 01:04:12.083
Why?

1345
01:04:12.791 --> 01:04:17.916
Because Jesus said to love your enemies and pray for those
who persecute you.

1346
01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:19.000
Yes...

1347
01:04:20.208 --> 01:04:21.583
Yes. but it's...

1348
01:04:22.416 --> 01:04:23.750
It's more complicated than that.

1349
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.458
I thought so too. when I was young.

1350
01:04:25.458 --> 01:04:29.375
I remember thinking that every slight was a big deal and I
couldn't back down from anyone.

1351
01:04:29.958 --> 01:04:33.166
But twenty years from now you won't even remember what the
fight was about.

1352
01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:34.916
I'd remember who won.

1353
01:04:35.083 --> 01:04:37.375
And what exactly would you be winning?

1354
01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:40.083
The ladies are never as impressed by the fights as you
wished they were.

1355
01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:43.541
If someone talked to you the way that guy talked to me

1356
01:04:43.541 --> 01:04:44.708
wouldn't you want to fight him?

1357
01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:45.750
I'd be tempted.

1358
01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:50.125
Which is why instead I'd have to fight myself.

1359
01:04:50.125 --> 01:04:51.708
[chuckles]

1360
01:04:56.583 --> 01:04:57.791
Thank you. Pastor.

1361
01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:00.916
You've given me a lot of good food for thought.

1362
01:05:01.958 --> 01:05:02.750
That's good to hear.

1363
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:05.583
So...

1364
01:05:07.041 --> 01:05:08.250
what movie should we see?

1365
01:05:14.291 --> 01:05:15.416
I'm sorry.

1366
01:05:17.916 --> 01:05:19.083
But I have plans.

1367
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:20.833
Okay.

1368
01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.500
But there's something you should know.

1369
01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:29.291
If you fight him I'll have to fire you.

1370
01:05:30.375 --> 01:05:31.208
What?

1371
01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:32.625
Why?

1372
01:05:32.791 --> 01:05:34.750
You represent the church now.

1373
01:05:34.958 --> 01:05:37.000
And the Lord's servant must not quarrel.

1374
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.833
Aren't you quarreling with me right now?

1375
01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:42.041
I am gently instructing those who oppose the truth.

1376
01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:43.750
What if I show up for the fight and he doesn't?

1377
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:45.041
Same consequence.

1378
01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:46.166
Even if there's no fight?

1379
01:05:46.166 --> 01:05:47.916
Showing up would mean you approve of it.

1380
01:05:47.916 --> 01:05:50.041
If there's no fight then no one gets hurt.

1381
01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:51.833
Your reputation would be hurt.

1382
01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:54.083
I think you mean your reputation.

1383
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:56.625
What's going on with you. Danny?

1384
01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.083
It's like you're suddenly a different person.

1385
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:04.875
Maybe this is the real me.

1386
01:06:07.166 --> 01:06:08.333
I hope not.

1387
01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:12.416
Because the Danny I know has a bright future in ministry
ahead of him.

1388
01:06:14.833 --> 01:06:17.083
Whether that happens or not is up to you.

1390
01:06:27.541 --> 01:06:30.791
You're always telling me I should take your advice so...

1391
01:06:31.166 --> 01:06:32.000
what should I do?

1392
01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:33.875
[Theresia] Don't fight him.
[Beau] Fight him.

1393
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:35.458
He shouldn't back down.

1394
01:06:35.583 --> 01:06:38.208
It's not worth getting fired over. Megan won't be impressed.

1395
01:06:38.291 --> 01:06:39.166
How do you know?

1396
01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:40.500
It wouldn't impress me.

1397
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.166
You're not her. She likes the bad boys.

1398
01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:44.750
Which is why she doesn't like Danny.

1399
01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:45.875
She might after this.

1400
01:06:46.458 --> 01:06:48.750
You can find a new job. God will forgive you.

1401
01:06:48.916 --> 01:06:50.333
I'll have to find a new church.

1402
01:06:50.375 --> 01:06:51.750
You can join Megan's.

1403
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:52.916
Unless she rejects you.

1404
01:06:52.916 --> 01:06:54.541
Which is all she's been trying to do.

1405
01:06:54.666 --> 01:06:56.750
He should do it anyway. It would be good for his reputation.

1406
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:58.041
With everyone except Megan.

1407
01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:02.625
And Pastor Jack. I don't want to be a jerk to him. He's the
only one who's ever been there for me.

1408
01:07:02.625 --> 01:07:03.958
We'll be there for you.

1409
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.791
And I really want to see this fight.

1410
01:07:07.208 --> 01:07:10.333
Well. even if I go. there's not gonna be a fight.

1411
01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:11.458
What?

1412
01:07:11.458 --> 01:07:12.666
He's not gonna show up.

1413
01:07:12.791 --> 01:07:13.708
How do you know?

1414
01:07:13.708 --> 01:07:14.750
I have a feeling.

1415
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:16.833
Danny. I saw the video. This guy means business.

1416
01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:20.416
Yes. that's what the video was supposed to communicate.
but...

1417
01:07:20.666 --> 01:07:21.500
I don't believe it.

1418
01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:22.541
Why not?

1419
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.583
Because I'm him.

1420
01:07:29.166 --> 01:07:30.333
I'm the rebel.

1421
01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:33.583
But Megan likes him.

1422
01:07:33.625 --> 01:07:35.041
She doesn't know it's me.

1423
01:07:35.333 --> 01:07:36.583
She doesn't recognize you?

1424
01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:39.916
Like you're Clark Kent. and this other guy's Superman.

1425
01:07:41.041 --> 01:07:41.916
That's ridiculous.

1426
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:43.125
You don't believe me?

1427
01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:46.375
Danny. some day you will find a girl who will appreciate
your imagination.

1428
01:07:46.416 --> 01:07:48.958
But Megan is not the one. You need to let her go.

1429
01:07:48.958 --> 01:07:49.916
Unbelievable.

1430
01:07:49.916 --> 01:07:51.250
Our thoughts exactly.

1431
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:55.125
Why is it so crazy to think that I could be a rebel?

1432
01:07:55.125 --> 01:07:56.791
Because we know you.

1433
01:07:57.125 --> 01:07:58.500
But I think I see what you're getting at.

1434
01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:01.916
You think that if you show up and he doesn't you win. right?

1435
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:02.583
Right.

1436
01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:03.333
Wrong!

1437

01:18:02.916 --> 01:18:04.041
Real quick. the point is --

1614
01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:07.041
[door knocks]

1615
01:18:07.333 --> 01:18:08.541
Excuse me just a minute.

1616
01:18:14.041 --> 01:18:15.083
Hello.

1617
01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:20.541
Is this a bad time?

1618
01:18:22.708 --> 01:18:24.250
No. Uh. come in.

1619
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:41.000
I hear you got fired.

1620
01:18:43.708 --> 01:18:45.541
Yeah. I deserved it.

1621
01:18:48.666 --> 01:18:50.166
So what are you gonna do now?

1622
01:18:52.041 --> 01:18:54.000
Well I still have Bible College.

1623
01:18:54.625 --> 01:18:56.875
But I'll have to pay for it myself.

1624
01:18:58.583 --> 01:18:59.458
How?

1625
01:19:01.666 --> 01:19:02.791
Maybe steal a van?

1626
01:19:04.791 --> 01:19:06.000
It might take more than one.

1627
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:06.666
[laughs]

1628
01:19:16.125 --> 01:19:18.041
Is this really what you came by to talk about?

1629
01:19:21.083 --> 01:19:21.833
No.

1630
01:19:26.041 --> 01:19:27.416
I want to know why you did it.

1631
01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:30.250
Did what?

1632
01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:32.333
Told me the truth.

1633
01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:35.458
You had me fooled.

1634
01:19:36.791 --> 01:19:39.208
You could have gotten away with it for as long as you liked.

1635
01:19:42.958 --> 01:19:43.791
Well...

1636
01:19:43.791 --> 01:19:46.333
Knowing what you know now...

1637
01:19:47.041 --> 01:19:48.666
would you have wanted it that way?

1638
01:19:49.208 --> 01:19:50.125
Of course not.

1639
01:19:51.916 --> 01:19:54.333
Then I guess that's why I knew I had to do it.

1640
01:20:01.583 --> 01:20:03.041
Did you talk to your dad?

1641
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.166
I should go.

1642
01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.666
Thanks for stopping by.

1643
01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:22.000
One more thing.

1644
01:20:23.541 --> 01:20:24.833
It doesn't have to be now.

1645
01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:26.500
But...

1646
01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.041
sometime...

1647
01:20:28.583 --> 01:20:29.958
when you're free...

1648
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:34.000
could we get coffee?

1649
01:20:38.625 --> 01:23:42.875
