What the hell are you doing here?
You thought I was gonna let you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.080
What the hell are you doing here?
You thought I was gonna let you

6
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.760
do this on your own. did you?

7
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.960
Did you? Is that what you thought?
Go get the bags.

8
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.680
Hold on. have you spoken to Keenan?
Look. forget about Keenan.

9
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.000
It's just us now. love.
- It's just us.
- Do you mean it?

10
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.280
It's just us now. love.
- It's just us.
- Do you mean it?

11
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.800
Of course I mean it.

12
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.080
I mean it.

13
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.000
Watch yourself.
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

14
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.280
Watch yourself.
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

15
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.520
Christ.

16
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.000
You've got great timing

17
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.360
You've got great timing

18
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.400
You're the one that's early!

19
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.000
- My love.
- What the fuck is that?

20
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.600
- My love.
- What the fuck is that?

21
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.000
Don't worry.
I'll get rid of it down south.

22
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.400
Oh. yeah. Like that'll be of use
in the hospital

23
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.000
Weapon sighted.

24
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.040
Weapon sighted.

25
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.240
Bandit's
heading south.

26
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.400
Christ! Has this
thing got square wheels or what?

27
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.720
Don't fly anywhere. love.

28
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.000
Just you hold onto the wee fella.

29
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.840
Just you hold onto the wee fella.

30
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.960
I don't want him bouncing out!

31
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.000
Oh. it's good to see you.

32
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.200
Oh. it's good to see you.

33
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.320
You know I didn't wanna do this
without you.

34
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.720
What? What is it?

35
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.000
Shit.
You can lose them in the woods.

36
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.520
Shit.
You can lose them in the woods.

37
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.920
Carol. I'm not leaving you.

38
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.240
- Just go. Just go. please!
- I'm not
leaving you with them fuckers.

39
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.000
I know. Michael. but if you stay.
we don't stand a chance. OK?

40
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.360
I know. Michael. but if you stay.
we don't stand a chance. OK?

41
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.880
They're not after me.
Go on. please. Michael!

42
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Go!

43
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.520
Go! Go! Go!

44
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.120
British Army!

45
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.440
O'Hara. do not move!

46
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.680
Major fucking propaganda victory for
the Republicans. Tempest.

47
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.040
What the hell happened?

48
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.080
Intel reported a weapon in the car.

49
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.000
Sir. SIB'S at the gate.
- Shall I let them in?
- No.

50
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.800
Sir. SIB'S at the gate.
- Shall I let them in?
- No.

51
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.720
You don't expect us to believe that?
- The Bandit had six kills.
- Seven.

52
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.000
- Sir?
- Ryan didn't make it.

53
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.120
- Sir?
- Ryan didn't make it.

54
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.600
But your bandit did.
Fuck knows where he is.

55
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.880
Go on.

56
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.440
British Army! O'Hara. do not move!

57
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.280
We were tipped off about his
location but

58
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.000
when we moved in.
we found the vehicle abandoned.

59
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.640
when we moved in.
we found the vehicle abandoned.

60
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.000
I thought I was facing
an imminent threat. sir.

61
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.080
I thought I was facing
an imminent threat. sir.

62
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.440
You thought
you were going to be shot?

63
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.040
That was my reading of the
situation. I was about to be shot.

64
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.480
By a pregnant woman in labour?

65
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.880
Sir. SIB are-Fuck off!

66
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.320
Well. that's that. then.
Glad we sorted that out.

67
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.640
This shitshow doesn't end

68
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.000
with us hoicking Snowy here
out in a chopper.

69
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.680
with us hoicking Snowy here
out in a chopper.

70
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.720
We don't have that authority.
No you don't but I do.

71
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.560
Tempest. would you wait outside?

72
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.760
Can I have the room?

73
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.000
- This room?
- Get out.

74
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.720
- This room?
- Get out.

75
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.640
Soldiers are here
in support of the civil power.

76
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.000
They have no legal authority beyond
that of an ordinary civilian.

77
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
They have no legal authority beyond
that of an ordinary civilian.

78
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.960
Any actions they take

79
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.520
must be in accordance with
the laws of the United Kingdom

80
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.000
and are. in fact.
punishable by those laws.

81
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.680
and are. in fact.
punishable by those laws.

82
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.440
I'm aware of the yellow card. sir.

83
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.120
Good...

84
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.000
...because YOU are about to be
prosecuted for murder.

85
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.440
...because YOU are about to be
prosecuted for murder.

86
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.000
There are... two ways out of this.

87
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.960
There are... two ways out of this.

88
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.200
One. we open that door.

89
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.000
We let SIB in to rip you apart.

90
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.560
We let SIB in to rip you apart.

91
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.160
Your commanding officers.
they'll try and protect you

92
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.680
but you'll cease to be a soldier.

93
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.000
You'll spend the next three years
sharpening pencils

94
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.520
You'll spend the next three years
sharpening pencils

95
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.240
for a bunch of lawyers and
THEN you'll probably go to prison.

96
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.680
OR...

97
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.640
...you come and work for me.

98
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.760
I'm putting together a detachment.
I could use a dead shot like you.

99
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.200
And what about all this?

100
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.000
I'll make it go away.

101
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.400
You make it sound easy. sir.

102
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.360
I assure you
it'll be anything but easy...

103
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.720
But you'll continue to serve your
country and do what you do best.

104
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.000
Where do I report. sir?

105
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.240
Where do I report. sir?

106
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.120
It's not really...
that sort of thing.

107
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.920
Do you have somewhere you can stay
off grid?

108
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.400
Somewhere that isn't the barracks?
I do.

109
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.000
Good.

110
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.960
Good.

111
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.040
Good. I'll see you in London.

112

Michael. I'm right here. darling.

CAROL'S VOICE:
Michael. I'm right here. darling.

114
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.560
I'm right here. Look.

115
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.000
It's OK. Michael.

116
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.480
It's OK. Michael.

117
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.760
Look. you had to go.

118
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.000
'Shops and offices were closed

'Shops and offices were closed

120
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.560
as hundreds of people
lined the route of the funeral.

121
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.120
In the Church of the Sacred Heart.

122
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.720
the circumstances of
Carol's shooting were referred to

tragedy that had touched everyone-'

tragedy that had touched everyone-'

125
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.040
We're so sorry for your loss.

126
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.440
Look... I'm not a doctor. I'm a vet.

127
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.000
Cats and dogs. You'll need someone
to check those wounds for you.

128
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.640
Cats and dogs. You'll need someone
to check those wounds for you.

129
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.840
- Thank you.
- Michael?

130
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.720
There is another way. you know?

131
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.120
There was.

132
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.000
Not any more.

133
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.160
Not any more.

134
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.280
Orla McShawn. Colm McNeish.

135
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.000
What the hell are you playing at
turning up here like this?

136
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.360
What the hell are you playing at
turning up here like this?

137
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.400
I thought you were dead.

138
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.880
I have business
with the man that killed Carol.

139
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.840
Brits flew him to London.

140
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.000
I need you to get me there.

141
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.560
I need you to get me there.

142
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.720
I'm sorry but you wanted out. Michael.

143
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.000
- I'll do whatever it takes.
- You're
not gonna like what it takes.

144
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.800
- I'll do whatever it takes.
- You're
not gonna like what it takes.

145
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.000
But I could use a man
they think is dead.

146
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.600
But I could use a man
they think is dead.

147
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.200
I'm taking Twomey.
Peadar Twomey's got problems.

148
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.840
Not with me he hasn't.

149
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.160
If we're to do this...

150
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.520
there'll be no more talk of getting
out until I say so. understood?

151
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.520
I need you to SAY it.

152
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Understood.

153
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.960
And. Michael?

154
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.000
I'm gonna need that ring.

155
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.920
Just give me
the name of that soldier.

156
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.160
Sheila went back with her mother.

157
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.200
Didn't like it...
stuck all the way out here.

158
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.040
Still...
I have the dog. I suppose.

159
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.000
Best dog I've ever had.

160
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.080
Best dog I've ever had.

161
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.160
I heard about Carol.

162
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.760
Fucking bastards.

163
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.000
I'm heading over the water.
I want you to come.

164
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.560
I'm heading over the water.
I want you to come.

165
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.640
Keenan's putting us with a unit.
I can't.

166
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.320
The dog would miss me too much.

167
00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.360
You know. he'd be lost without me.

168
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.000
I'm going after the soldier
that killed Carol.

169
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.520
I need your help.

170
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.640
The papers are coming tonight.

171
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.680

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.200
Any more questions?

345
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.240
Did you just call us animals. sir?

346
00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.320
You are animals...

347
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.400
...but you're MY animals.

348
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.080
Which reminds me...
your bandit finally showed up.

349
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.000
Buried yesterday.
Full military honours.

350
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.680
Buried yesterday.
Full military honours.

351
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.000
On behalf of the good guys...

352
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.400
On behalf of the good guys...

353
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.440
Cheers.

354
00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.000
The lads are expecting you.

355
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.880
The lads are expecting you.

356
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.000
Stay away from the Irish community.

357
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.640
Stay away from the Irish community.

358
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.520
Avoid the pubs and clubs
Irish people go to.

359
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.560
They'll be under surveillance.

360
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.000
The only person we talk to. apart
from other members of the ASU.

361
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.440
The only person we talk to. apart
from other members of the ASU.

362
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.400
is the courier.

363
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.960
- You must be McGill.
- McGill's dead.

364
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.000
Who the fuck are you?

365
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.040
You first.
Quinn. engineer.

366
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.000
What about you. big man?
Liam Hogan. QM.

367
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.680
What about you. big man?
Liam Hogan. QM.

368
00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.680
Who the fuck are you?

369
00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.360
I'm Joe Lynch.

370
00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.000
I'm the driver and I make the tea.

371
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.960
I'm the driver and I make the tea.

372
00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.800
They're stopping people
in the street.

373
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.280
They'll pat you down as soon
as they hear your accent.

374
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.000
They'd do a better job than you
then. would they?

375
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.560
They'd do a better job than you
then. would they?

376
00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.040
Hey!

377
00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.000
Go on. then. I'm listening.

378
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.080
Go on. then. I'm listening.

379
00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.160
I'm working with the police.

380
00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.000
What? The police? Henry.

381
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.120
What? The police? Henry.

382
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.400
Not exactly WITH but...

383
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.000
..it's complicated.

384
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.240
..it's complicated.

385
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.560
And that guy from this morning.
he's got a bloody nose too?

386
00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.360
No. I didn't think so.

387
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.920
You know. my dad used to work for
a man like him.

388
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Superintendent.

389
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.840
Promised him a better life if he
went to fight for king and country

390
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.000
but... when my dad came home.
he got nothing.

391
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.680
but... when my dad came home.
he got nothing.

392
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.040
Just a job
cleaning shit out of toilets.

393
00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.000
There's no king or
country for you. Henry.

394
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.320
There's no king or
country for you. Henry.

395
00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.320
You're just a black man
in a white man's world.

396
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.000
No-one's looking out for you.

397
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.560
No-one's looking out for you.

398
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.560
The old man sends his regards.

399
00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.280
I came here for a name.

400
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.000
I know why you're here
but that was before Kentish Town.

401
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.600
I know why you're here
but that was before Kentish Town.

402
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.200
First you have to deliver a box.

403
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.880
A station. You choose.

404
00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.000
That's a big fucking box. It's
gonna take time. I can't be waiting.

405
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.400
That's a big fucking box. It's
gonna take time. I can't be waiting.

406
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.840
We both know
that isn't how it works.

407
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.000
All right.

408
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.560
All right.

409
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.600
I'll do it
but you gotta give me that name.

410
00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.000
To be clear.
personal agendas have no place here.

411
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.480
To be clear.
personal agendas have no place here.

412
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.520
Please just give me the name.

413
00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.000
Wait! Henry?

414
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Hiya.

415
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.000
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm not really open.

416
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.320
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm not really open.

417
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.040
It's a bit of an emergency. Erm...

418
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.080
I'm looking for something for my wife.

419
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.000
Er... What are you after?

420
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.200
Er... What are you after?

421
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.360
- A dress.
- Do you know what size?

422
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.000
No.

423
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.280
No.

424
00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.960
All right. is she bigger or smaller
than me. then?

425
00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.000
Erm... she's a little bit smaller
than you.

426
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.560
Erm... she's a little bit smaller
than you.

427
00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.640
What colour's her hair?

428
00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.760
Red.

429
00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.280
And her eyes?

430
00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.720
Blue.

431
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.760
Lucky girl.

432
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.000
She sounds beautiful.

433
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.040
She sounds beautiful.

434
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.760
- She was.
- Where is it?

435
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.000
Here it is.

436
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.320
Here it is.

437
00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.440
He's in a beige mac.

438
00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.080
I swear I saw a gun.

439
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.000
Right. you look that way
and then search this end. yeah?

440
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.240
Right. you look that way
and then search this end. yeah?

441
00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.520
There you are. I love that bag.

442
00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.800
This way.

443
00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.000
What's the matter with you?

444
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.840
What's the matter with you?

445
00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.960
She's not even a legitimate target.

446
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.000
The path to freedom has rules.

447
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:52.960
The path to freedom has rules.

448
00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.600
There is a code. You break those
and the objective fails.

449
00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.240
The path to freedom?

450
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.080
You really are one of Keenan's
little soldiers. aren't you?

451
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.160
I was top of the class too once.

452
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.400
Except back then. people didn't
talk like a fucking Brit.

453
00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.800
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

454
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.400
The man you want is working
for the police hunting your unit.

455
00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.000
Right now. my odds are on him.

456
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.520
Right now. my odds are on him.

457
00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.000
Have you ever been in love?

458
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:40.560
Have you ever been in love?

459
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.480
Have you?

460
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.920
I need to kill him.

461
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.960
Then do your job.

462
00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.760
Deliver the box.

463
00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.640
And he'll come running.

464
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.000
Look at the clip of this. I never
signed up to nanny the police.

465
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.160
Look at the clip of this. I never
signed up to nanny the police.

466
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.280
Yep.

467
00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.000
What? Hm?

468
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:20.280
What? Hm?

469
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
I think his nose was thinner...

470
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:28.280
I think his nose was thinner...

471
00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.960
Good girl.

472
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.240
- Henry.
- What are you doing here?

473
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.920
It's... crazy.

474
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.000
They were chasing this guy
in the market. he had a gun.

475
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.360
They were chasing this guy
in the market. he had a gun.

476
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.200
They think
he's one of these Irish guys.

477
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.000
You saw him?
Well. he was in my stall.

478
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:44.440
You saw him?
Well. he was in my stall.

479
00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.000
He was buying a dress for his wife.
What?

480
00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.280
- Hey. Henry. what's wrong?
- Just get
home. Cole. take her home.

481
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.000
O'Hara's alive. He went after Ruth.

482
00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.000
It's him.
He's here and he's come for me.

483
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.720
It's him.
He's here and he's come for me.

484
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.440
What's the deadline for the evening
- edition?
- Midnight.

485
00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.000
Right. Let's flush him out.

486
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:08.280
Right. Let's flush him out.

487
00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.680
When did you last turn the jelly?
It looks like it's ready to weep.

488
00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.000
No. they're grand.

489
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.320
No. they're grand.

490
00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.440
You should be worrying about the detonators.

491
00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:22.960
We lost them in Kentish Town.

492
00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.000
Turn the jelly
and pack it in sawdust.

493
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.560
Turn the jelly
and pack it in sawdust.

494
00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.200
...before we get there.

495
00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.240
We're hitting Paddington.

496
00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.440
Twomey. we need to talk.

497
00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.000
Like the station?

498
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:40.360
Like the station?

499
00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.160
No. the fucking bear

500
00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:47.480
He'll be in a blue Rover
coming down Praed Street.

501
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.400
You'll need to be somewhere high.

502
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.120
And we'll need a car. a fast one.

503
00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.000
Once I make that call.
we'll have to move quick.

504
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.680
Once I make that call.
we'll have to move quick.

505
00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.760
'We're on. He's gonna do it.'

506
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.000
I don't know
what I'd do without you. kitty cat.

507
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:28.160
I don't know
what I'd do without you. kitty cat.

508
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.040
Tell him not to call it in.

509
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.120
I want it to be a surprise.

510
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.120
A surprise?'Yeah.'

511
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
It's time to scale up.

512
00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.560
Too many people
are getting caught up in this.

513
00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.880
Just keep it clean.

514
00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.000
Make the call.
Give 'em time to get out.

515
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.520
Make the call.
Give 'em time to get out.

516
00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.560
I'm only interested
in killing one man.

517
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.120
