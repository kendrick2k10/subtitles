condition one in three minutes.

4
00:00:51.126 --> 00:00:53.541
Obviously. I was away for months.

5
00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:55.958
that's why she found another guy.

6
00:00:55.959 --> 00:01:01.626
You know. I'm telling you all this.
and I feel relieved.

7
00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:09.292
But that's okay.
before leaving. I met a girl.

8
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.626
She's so freaking hot!

9
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.458
She is a yoga coach.

10
00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.375
as lithe as a panther.

11
00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:17.501
Although. she is not very bright.

12
00:01:17.792 --> 00:01:19.125
Have you fallen for her?

13
00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:22.459
Come on. we've just met.

14
00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:25.292
We've only been out a few times.

15
00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:26.958
Will she wait for you?

16
00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:28.626
How can you tell?

17
00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:33.001
I just want to find the right gal...

18
00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.500
I'd quit this.

19
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:37.126
The Ghost is on the way. full alert.

20
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:40.209
Oh. the employer...

21
00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:43.834
I am a romantic.

22
00:01:44.084 --> 00:01:45.834
You're a mercenary.

23
00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:50.084
Yasha. give us a status update.

24
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.542
Go. all clear.

25
00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.292
Let's get back to civilian life.

26
00:01:57.417 --> 00:02:00.084
No. brother. I'll pass.

27
00:02:02.417 --> 00:02:05.959
You should get yourself somebody.
a goldfish or something.

28
00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:07.875
Will do.

29
00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:09.792
Whatever.

30
00:02:10.292 --> 00:02:12.376
Let's see...

31
00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:15.792
I've never seen those boys on the base.

32
00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:20.208
So. hand grenades. Nothing new.

33
00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.251
MANPADS. Not bad!

34
00:02:24.084 --> 00:02:26.959
Hey. that must be our new boss.

35
00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:29.709
So that's what the Ghost looks like...

36
00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:31.625
I've heard about him.

37
00:02:31.626 --> 00:02:34.959
He is odd. always shows up personally.

38
00:02:35.376 --> 00:02:38.917
They say he has been working
with some serious stuff since the '90s.

39
00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:44.001
Dad!

40
00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:50.084
Dad!

41
00:02:55.292 --> 00:02:56.459
Dad!

42
00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.042
Dad!

43
00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:02.751
Daddy!

44
00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:11.001
Let go! Let me go!

45
00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.167
Hold it. chief.

46
00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:20.209
Or I'll shoot your wolf-cub.

47
00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:26.459
I should have shot you in Gudermes.

48
00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:29.251
but I took pity on you as you were young.

49
00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.042
Let the boy go.

50
00:03:33.084 --> 00:03:36.126
Chief. this is the last time
I'm offering this.

51
00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:38.125
It'll be enough money for everybody.

52
00:03:38.126 --> 00:03:40.126
It is not about the money.

53
00:03:41.584 --> 00:03:44.959
Here's the deal.
I won't give you up to the cops.

54
00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:46.875
Take it out of the factory.

55
00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:48.626
You have 24 hours.

56
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:53.959
Dad.

57
00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:57.291
Dad! Daddy!

58
00:03:57.292 --> 00:04:00.251
No! Daddy. no!

59
00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:08.292
Nikita...

60
00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:11.751
Hey. what are you doing?

61
00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:24.209
Spread out! Go on! Take them down!

62
00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:27.584
Contact. Who fired?

63
00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:31.084
- Yasha. get on the radio.
- It's the client. we're done for.

64
00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:32.459
What's going on?

65
00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:35.584
Yasha. do something. stop jerking off!

66
00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:37.584
We are so done...

67
00:04:39.042 --> 00:04:42.084
Target coordinates. four. distance. 300.

68
00:04:42.792 --> 00:04:45.292
Machine-gun is ready. we're backing off!

69
00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:49.876
Digger. get out of the way!

70
00:04:50.376 --> 00:04:52.042
Give me the coordinates.

71
00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:54.166
Squared four. by snail six.

72
00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:55.792
Our snipers are there!

73
00:04:55.834 --> 00:04:57.626
Carry out the order.

74
00:04:57.667 --> 00:04:59.875
Varyag. I'm sending you a fun gift.

75
00:04:59.876 --> 00:05:01.709
Now we are fucked for sure.

76
00:05:04.126 --> 00:05:05.751
Get out of here!

77
00:06:30.334 --> 00:06:33.208
And why have you stopped. Nikita?

78
00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:35.126
Dance a little bit more.

79
00:06:37.626 --> 00:06:40.709
Well... That kid.

80
00:08:08.542 --> 00:08:10.292
Open it.

81
00:08:19.042 --> 00:08:20.584
Alive?

82
00:08:22.542 --> 00:08:25.542
First you beat me.
and now you're asking if I'm okay?

83
00:08:26.376 --> 00:08:29.126
And you better act like a human being.

84
00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:31.959
Educator. my ass...

85
00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:34.042
You have been sitting here.
hiding from something.

86
00:08:34.501 --> 00:08:36.000
Are you messed up or something?

87
00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:38.334
How about I report you to the police?

88
00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:43.251
Look after Yoda. will you?

89
00:08:49.334 --> 00:08:51.001
Take some money.

90
00:08:55.376 --> 00:08:57.209
Give it to your wife.

91
00:08:58.126 --> 00:09:00.209
Will you be away for long?

92
00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:02.667
We'll see how it goes.

93
00:09:10.209 --> 00:09:14.084
I'm telling you. fuckers. there was
this dude. Byron was his name.

94
00:09:14.626 --> 00:09:20.292
Earl or something... What was it... Lord!
Yes.

95
00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:23.750
Anyway... He considered himself a genius
and fucked his sister.

96
00:09:23.751 --> 00:09:25.458
No shit. Really?

97
00:09:25.459 --> 00:09:28.876
Why did they even teach you to read?

98
00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:33.334
Guess what I read about Pushkin...

99
00:09:40.251 --> 00:09:41.709
Hey. what's your problem?

100
00:09:47.001 --> 00:09:51.209
Hey. listen! You were asked a question.

101
00:09:56.542 --> 00:09:58.334
Well...

102
00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:02.167
Are you lost or something?
Looking for your Mom?

103
00:10:03.709 --> 00:10:06.834
A moron. it seems.

104
00:10:07.917 --> 00:10:12.001
Wow. you're no chicken. nice.

105
00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:16.416
I see you've gotten acquainted.

106
00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:17.709
Who's that?

107
00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:20.959
Who are they? We had a deal that
these would be professional soldiers.

108
00:10:22.542 --> 00:10:27.459
Let's go talk. Come.

109
00:10:40.167 --> 00:10:42.291
They are not pros. They are a liability.

110
00:10:42.292 --> 00:10:44.375
Buddy. what are you so emotional about?

111
00:10:44.376 --> 00:10:46.833
They'll do what you say.
What else do you need?

112
00:10:46.834 --> 00:10:51.500
I need soldiers. If something
goes wrong. they are dead meat.

113
00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:55.709
Do you know why they always sell
shitty coffee at the gas stations?

114
00:10:56.126 --> 00:10:59.625
No reason to purchase expensive stuff
you can't capitalize on.

115
00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:03.251
if you can get trash instead
and earn a lot from it.

116
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:07.792
Just remember. old friend.
Quality is not profitable.

117
00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.750
I came up with the plan.
I know who is good for this.

118
00:11:10.751 --> 00:11:16.209
It's your fantasy. The plan is mine.
You just floated the idea.

119
00:11:16.917 --> 00:11:21.042
I arranged everything. I found the men.

120
00:11:21.126 --> 00:11:24.041
compiled the info.
I believe in these guys.

121
00:11:24.042 --> 00:11:25.709
You don't.

122
00:11:27.126 --> 00:11:28.459
They are just kids.

123
00:11:29.084 --> 00:11:33.209
Maybe you are just scared shitless?

124
00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:38.459
But we'll be fine without you.

125
00:11:46.917 --> 00:11:48.917
Or are you with us?

126
00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:51.709
Yes. I am.

127
00:11:52.126 --> 00:11:53.667
Cool!

128
00:11:54.584 --> 00:11:55.792
Hi.

129
00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:00.417
- Is our table over there?
- Yes.

130
00:12:03.042 --> 00:12:04.542
Who's that?

131
00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:07.417
Records clerk. Do you like her?

132
00:12:08.917 --> 00:12:12.001
- Hi. Hello. boys.
- Hello.

133
00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:15.250
Who else?

134
00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:17.084
- Hi.
- Notary.

135
00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:19.667
See. Wicked is turned on.

136
00:12:19.876 --> 00:12:23.709
She's classy. Wicked. come on!
And you tell me about his sister...

137
00:12:25.584 --> 00:12:29.083
Everybody's here. guys. Everything
has been arranged. Meet Yasha.

138
00:12:29.084 --> 00:12:30.875
He is in charge.

139
00:12:30.876 --> 00:12:31.959
Who? Him?

140
00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:37.834
My command orders are to be followed
at once and without any discussion.

141
00:12:38.417 --> 00:12:39.833
Security is unarmed for sure?

142
00:12:39.834 --> 00:12:41.251
I took care of it.

143
00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:44.376
Took care?

144
00:12:45.501 --> 00:12:47.791
Yesterday ATF took away all their guns

145
00:12:47.792 --> 00:12:49.709
until their violations are eliminated.

146
00:12:49.917 --> 00:12:51.917
This wouldn't have been an issue
in the '90s.

147
00:12:52.292 --> 00:12:55.375
Times are changing. my superiors
have more serious horsepower.

148
00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:57.584
We need at least one gun.

149
00:12:59.251 --> 00:13:03.292
Hey. listen up! If you crush
someone's head.

150
00:13:03.667 --> 00:13:06.167
I'll cover it up for you. Again.

151
00:13:06.876 --> 00:13:11.334
But if you take somebody out.
you can't afford this.

152
00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:15.876
Kiddos. we are negotiating
from the stronger position.

153
00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:17.959
but within the confines of the law.

154
00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:20.834
You were hired to neutralize security.

155
00:13:20.876 --> 00:13:23.459
You stay out until I tell you otherwise.

156
00:13:23.542 --> 00:13:25.792
So work quick and quiet.

157
00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:29.251
I am in charge.

158
00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:31.542
What?

159
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:44.958
I come into this dive bar. there's
this goof sitting in plain sight.

160
00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:46.250
The bald one?

161
00:13:46.251 --> 00:13:48.876
No. the one they nudged from Zarechensky.

162
00:13:49.251 --> 00:13:51.542
The bald guy will never come back.

163
00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:56.959
Hello.

164
00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.416
Hello. beautiful.
How can I help you. darling?

165
00:14:00.417 --> 00:14:02.417
I am here instead of Natalya today.

166
00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:04.416
And what is wrong with our Natalya?

167
00:14:04.417 --> 00:14:06.083
Sick. blood pressure or something.

168
00:14:06.084 --> 00:14:10.541
Even better. otherwise
we would never have seen a girl like you.

169
00:14:10.542 --> 00:14:13.167
I think I'm getting blood pressure
or something...

170
00:14:17.251 --> 00:14:18.458
What's all this?

171
00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:20.959
You got sick of your job? Stupid bitch!

172
00:14:21.334 --> 00:14:22.958
Do you know who I am?

173
00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:25.459
I know. You are a whiny little skunk.

174
00:14:25.709 --> 00:14:26.834
Stop laughing!

175
00:14:27.126 --> 00:14:28.376
What?

176
00:14:28.917 --> 00:14:32.001
Hey. big guy. what do you mean.
whiny little skunk?

177
00:14:32.376 --> 00:14:34.667
You fuck. I'll put you down.
and your old man

178
00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:37.542
will be thankful for it too. Got it?

179
00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:38.958
Sit down.

180
00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:41.751
Come on. Petro. what's the big deal?

181
00:14:44.376 --> 00:14:47.000
I see. the meeting is in high gear.

182
00:14:47.001 --> 00:14:49.583
Decided to shake off the rust. Petro?

183
00:14:49.584 --> 00:14:51.876
Just smoking. Vasiliy.

184
00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:54.583
Smoking kills you. get some booze.

185
00:14:54.584 --> 00:14:57.584
Pete is on a warpath again.

186
00:14:57.917 --> 00:15:01.916
Vasiliy Mihailovich. as a representative
of the largest shareholder

187
00:15:01.917 --> 00:15:04.792
I demand you fire this bitch immediately.

188
00:15:08.334 --> 00:15:13.834
The largest shareholder is your father.
a rather serious man.

189
00:15:14.834 --> 00:15:17.667
Cut the crap. sit down.
Don't tarnish your father's name.

190
00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:21.834
Are you seriously trying to hurt
the shareholder's feelings?

191
00:15:22.209 --> 00:15:24.626
His father is a shareholder. not him.

192
00:15:25.292 --> 00:15:27.084
Well then. off you go.

193
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:36.001
Vasiliy. that was awesome!

194
00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:15.459
Shove your care up your ass.
I'm better off without it.

195
00:16:17.834 --> 00:16:19.667
Change into security uniforms.

196
00:16:21.417 --> 00:16:23.458
Is it your idea to put on pig's stuff?

197
00:16:23.459 --> 00:16:26.084
It's lame to dress up like this.

198
00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:27.833
Look here! Fuck it.

199
00:16:27.834 --> 00:16:30.292
Watch your mouth. we have a lady here.

200
00:16:39.584 --> 00:16:42.084
We are going as is. got it?

201
00:16:43.417 --> 00:16:45.916
When we are done here.
you come in through the main entrance.

202
00:16:45.917 --> 00:16:50.001
No. I want to keep tabs on this
so I am going with you.

203
00:16:50.667 --> 00:16:52.500
With this lineup?

204
00:16:52.501 --> 00:16:53.751
Come here!

205
00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:56.125
In the '90s. they moved in
on the armories. didn't they?

206
00:16:56.126 --> 00:16:57.250
Today is not the '90s.

207
00:16:57.251 --> 00:16:58.501
That's the point.

208
00:17:11.667 --> 00:17:12.958
Here.

209
00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:15.709
Found it by accident.
thought you might be interested.

210
00:17:16.376 --> 00:17:21.709
The old issue of Blade weapons!
Where did you get that?

211
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:28.000
You know. Eva.
the battles used to be noble

212
00:17:28.001 --> 00:17:30.125
and depended on the skills
of wielding a blade.

213
00:17:30.126 --> 00:17:33.917
All douchebags are Mr. Colt's offspring.

214
00:17:36.751 --> 00:17:38.542
Do you want to hold it?

215
00:17:40.667 --> 00:17:42.292
No. thanks.

216
00:17:44.834 --> 00:17:46.708
I'll be in the file room.
if you need anything.

217
00:17:46.709 --> 00:17:48.501
dealing with documents.

218
00:17:51.167 --> 00:17:52.417
Damsel.

219
00:17:59.709 --> 00:18:04.083
How ironic! Back in the day they
made missiles in this factory

220
00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:06.625
- which killed people.
- Quiet!

221
00:18:06.626 --> 00:18:08.917
And nowadays. they make vodka here...

222
00:18:11.001 --> 00:18:13.001
which also kills people.

223
00:18:13.084 --> 00:18:15.459
Guys. I don't like it.
What the hell is he doing?

224
00:18:15.542 --> 00:18:17.209
What is this shushing?

225
00:18:17.459 --> 00:18:19.125
Hey! Calm down. Marine!

226
00:18:19.126 --> 00:18:21.084
Fellas. don't push the kid.

227
00:18:21.251 --> 00:18:24.417
It seems like he will talk
in a little while.

228
00:18:25.792 --> 00:18:27.376
Let's go. shall we?

229
00:18:31.126 --> 00:18:37.167
What a dump!
Hey. what the hell is this place?

230
00:18:37.251 --> 00:18:38.917
This is going to be a
construction site. my friend.

231
00:18:39.959 --> 00:18:41.001
What?

232
00:18:41.542 --> 00:18:43.167
A developer's lot.

233
00:18:43.209 --> 00:18:44.209
Large force. is it?

234
00:18:44.417 --> 00:18:45.626
From 30 to 40 bodies.

235
00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.459
Why so many? Are they afraid of us?

236
00:18:47.542 --> 00:18:48.876
They're afraid of their workers.

237
00:18:48.959 --> 00:18:50.459
Madam. you are being dull!

238
00:18:50.542 --> 00:18:52.876
They watch the men. so they can't rat.

239
00:18:52.959 --> 00:18:55.001
There's always been
a lot of security here.

240
00:18:55.084 --> 00:18:57.584
Used to hide secrets from enemies.
now from their own.

241
00:18:57.667 --> 00:19:00.167
In the Soviet era. they transported
missiles through the tunnel...

242
00:19:00.292 --> 00:19:01.709
but now it is completely empty.

243
00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:04.501
The manager here is an old leatherhead.

244
00:19:04.876 --> 00:19:07.126
He didn't cooperate.
and fucking missed his chances.

245
00:19:07.167 --> 00:19:09.458
Technician is coming with me.
the rest stay put.

246
00:19:09.459 --> 00:19:11.084
wait for the signal.

247
00:19:11.542 --> 00:19:13.042
Yes. sir.

248
00:19:13.292 --> 00:19:15.001
Will do. sir!

249
00:19:47.084 --> 00:19:50.126
Who the hell is there
in the transportation department?

250
00:19:53.126 --> 00:19:54.626
Roma!

251
00:19:55.251 --> 00:19:57.834
Watch the monitor. not your game.

252
00:19:58.126 --> 00:20:00.542
The telephone and the internet are okay.

253
00:20:01.626 --> 00:20:03.376
- What about cameras?
- Yes.

254
00:20:03.959 --> 00:20:08.876
Tower. do you copy? Who is in the old
transportation department?

255
00:20:09.126 --> 00:20:11.251
Get on the radio.

256
00:20:36.417 --> 00:20:40.584
Done. Now they are looking
at the recordings from last week.

257
00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:42.292
Jam the signals.

258
00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:48.666
No connection. I can't get through to him.

259
00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:51.042
Fuck it. let's do it quick.
or we are busted.

260
00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:54.209
Hey. let's celebrate the end of the shift!

261
00:20:57.667 --> 00:21:00.500
Hey. you goons! Dildos up your asses.

262
00:21:00.501 --> 00:21:02.041
- get down.
- Trespasser here.

263
00:21:02.042 --> 00:21:03.083
Quiet! Peacefully!

264
00:21:03.084 --> 00:21:05.126
Quiet! Zhora. come on.

265
00:21:12.126 --> 00:21:14.834
Hey. stop it. calm down. stop it!

266
00:21:27.126 --> 00:21:31.709
Everything is just as you like it!
Quick and quiet.

267
00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:33.834
Tie them up.

268
00:21:44.417 --> 00:21:46.501
Here we go! Just one.

269
00:21:49.876 --> 00:21:52.876
Who are you? Freeze!

270
00:21:59.042 --> 00:22:02.167
- Quiet.
- It hurts! Are you fucking nuts?

271
00:22:07.001 --> 00:22:08.167
Move on!

272
00:22:17.167 --> 00:22:19.584
Hey. are you trying
to get yourself killed?

273
00:22:19.626 --> 00:22:21.667
Come here...

274
00:22:23.334 --> 00:22:25.417
Come on. get him!

275
00:22:27.084 --> 00:22:28.584
Come on!

276
00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:37.042
Hit him! Break this motherfucker!

277
00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:51.501
Well. asshole. now you are done.

278
00:22:51.584 --> 00:22:53.542
What? Come over here!

279
00:22:55.792 --> 00:22:57.167
Knock him out!

280
00:23:18.709 --> 00:23:20.666
When is the shift change?
I am already hungry.

281
00:23:20.667 --> 00:23:22.167
A little over half an hour.

282
00:23:24.542 --> 00:23:25.834
Bring something from the canteen.

283
00:23:25.876 --> 00:23:29.084
- Hi. guys! Here is the thing...
- What are you doing here?

284
00:23:29.167 --> 00:23:30.792
- I want to warn you.
- Who are you?

285
00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:31.959
Well. as you wish...

286
00:23:41.542 --> 00:23:43.626
Come on!

287
00:23:45.084 --> 00:23:46.167
Here you go!

288
00:23:46.501 --> 00:23:47.792
Yes!

289
00:23:53.126 --> 00:23:56.626
Slow down. he is giving up.

290
00:24:01.584 --> 00:24:02.917
Are you?

291
00:24:04.126 --> 00:24:05.792
I think he is.

292
00:24:13.459 --> 00:24:15.501
Well. everything's done here.

293
00:24:16.542 --> 00:24:18.876
- Where are the other guards?
- On the shop floor.

294
00:24:19.126 --> 00:24:20.084
On the shop floor at night?

295
00:24:20.085 --> 00:24:26.584
A.V. KORNEEV

296
00:24:27.584 --> 00:24:29.584
Well. why are you frozen up?

297
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:34.251
Smile!

298
00:24:36.542 --> 00:24:38.501
We need to cover all floors.

299
00:24:48.376 --> 00:24:49.542
Hello.

300
00:25:06.792 --> 00:25:08.334
Move on. I'll get this one.

301
00:25:13.001 --> 00:25:17.334
It's just some museum. Soviet shit.

302
00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:24.459
Who are these leathernecks?

303
00:25:25.042 --> 00:25:26.833
Shareholders got stuck here.

304
00:25:26.834 --> 00:25:29.166
Hey. we can't just take out
bodyguards like this.

305
00:25:29.167 --> 00:25:31.542
Don't worry. you'll get a bonus.

306
00:25:31.917 --> 00:25:33.376
I'll deal with them.

307
00:25:34.876 --> 00:25:36.791
Who gives a fuck about global warming?

308
00:25:36.792 --> 00:25:38.791
It's just another scam.

309
00:25:38.792 --> 00:25:41.708
- Wait.
- Rothschild and Rockefeller did that.

310
00:25:41.709 --> 00:25:45.834
Attention! This is a raid.
For your own good.

311
00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:51.626
please come out. and do not resist.

312
00:25:52.459 --> 00:25:54.209
It's in your best interests.

313
00:25:54.917 --> 00:25:59.376
Guys. get down on the floor.
hands on your head.

314
00:26:00.084 --> 00:26:01.667
Let's go. tell us everything.

315
00:26:01.959 --> 00:26:04.208
No. guys. It's not a joke.

316
00:26:04.209 --> 00:26:05.542
No joking here.

317
00:26:10.584 --> 00:26:11.501
Hold it.

318
00:26:12.709 --> 00:26:14.416
Wait. let me see.

319
00:26:14.417 --> 00:26:15.501
Stop!

320
00:26:16.042 --> 00:26:18.542
Guys. it's for your own good.

321
00:26:18.834 --> 00:26:21.041
Hold it. quiet.

322
00:26:21.042 --> 00:26:22.916
Let's do this peacefully. okay?

323
00:26:22.917 --> 00:26:25.166
Who are you? What raid?

324
00:26:25.167 --> 00:26:27.875
I'll say it again. get down on the floor.

325
00:26:27.876 --> 00:26:29.251
hands on your head.

326
00:26:29.709 --> 00:26:31.917
Okay. let's solve this peacefully.

327
00:26:32.084 --> 00:26:35.126
Okay. peacefully. Agreed?

328
00:26:35.334 --> 00:26:36.501
Agreed.

329
00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:50.417
What is going on? I'll call the police.

330
00:26:52.667 --> 00:26:54.751
Guys. that's enough. stop.

331
00:26:55.126 --> 00:26:56.834
Stop. that's enough!

332
00:26:57.126 --> 00:27:00.417
I promise. nobody will be hurt.
it's for your own good.

333
00:27:00.834 --> 00:27:01.875
Come on!

334
00:27:01.876 --> 00:27:02.958
Go!

335
00:27:02.959 --> 00:27:04.167
Hands on your head.

336
00:27:04.542 --> 00:27:05.916
Hey. pussies!

337
00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:07.667
Come on!

338
00:28:44.501 --> 00:28:46.083
Shouldn't this be full screen?

339
00:28:46.084 --> 00:28:48.042
Should I bring you popcorn too?

340
00:28:48.792 --> 00:28:50.001
Exciting?

341
00:28:53.876 --> 00:28:56.375
So what. plush? You are so busted.

342
00:28:56.376 --> 00:28:59.001
Let me!

343
00:28:59.584 --> 00:29:01.876
Easy. Leave him alone.

344
00:29:02.292 --> 00:29:03.416
- Come on!
- Leave him.

345
00:29:03.417 --> 00:29:05.209
He is mine.

346
00:29:21.042 --> 00:29:22.459
Tie them up.

347
00:30:40.126 --> 00:30:41.209
We'll break everything here.

348
00:30:41.292 --> 00:30:44.126
Hey. smugglers. come on over here!

349
00:30:44.667 --> 00:30:45.917
Come over here. beautiful!

350
00:30:46.084 --> 00:30:47.667
Over here!

351
00:30:48.167 --> 00:30:50.584
Come on. I'm telling you. come over here!

352
00:31:04.292 --> 00:31:06.709
- What's with you?
- Double!

353
00:31:12.751 --> 00:31:13.876
Fuck!

354
00:31:48.709 --> 00:31:51.500
When my wife went to bed.
I watched such a great porn movie.

355
00:31:51.501 --> 00:31:53.334
How do you find time to do all this?

356
00:31:53.459 --> 00:32:00.125
- Come on over here!
- Come to me! Come!

357
00:32:00.126 --> 00:32:03.751
Over here! Come on! Hey!

358
00:32:04.751 --> 00:32:07.042
Cluck-cluck. little chickens!

359
00:32:07.542 --> 00:32:08.417
Here!

360
00:32:30.209 --> 00:32:36.792
Don't you understand.
fat ass. face on the floor! Down!

361
00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:42.917
Keep out of the way. dork!

362
00:32:55.167 --> 00:32:56.626
Where are you going?

363
00:32:56.876 --> 00:32:58.501
Easy-peasy.

364
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:05.334
- Fuck you!
- I believe you like to beat up old people.

365
00:33:17.542 --> 00:33:20.001
What did you do to my homeboy. bitch?

366
00:34:02.292 --> 00:34:03.376
Look here.

367
00:34:41.251 --> 00:34:42.251
Easy. gladiator!

368
00:34:42.252 --> 00:34:43.417
Or what?

369
00:35:01.959 --> 00:35:03.792
How are you. brother?

370
00:35:07.417 --> 00:35:09.167
What have we here?

371
00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:13.292
Looks like his ribs are broken.

372
00:35:14.959 --> 00:35:18.126
Relax. soldier. just breathe deeper.

373
00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:21.959
- What's this?
- This will make you feel better.

374
00:35:31.709 --> 00:35:35.042
You're a lifesaver. Doctor.

375
00:35:37.542 --> 00:35:38.875
Time to move.

376
00:35:38.876 --> 00:35:40.584
We aren't leaving him.

377
00:35:41.084 --> 00:35:45.667
Bring him to the locker room.
And close the shop floor.

378
00:35:46.501 --> 00:35:50.083
I came straight here through the factory.

379
00:35:50.084 --> 00:35:52.000
They tied everybody up.

380
00:35:52.001 --> 00:35:53.667
Take a seat.

381
00:35:55.876 --> 00:35:58.125
We have the shareholders meeting today.

382
00:35:58.126 --> 00:36:00.541
Looks like they want
to take over the factory.

383
00:36:00.542 --> 00:36:02.250
No one in authority called me.

384
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:03.750
They are beating the crap out of our men.

385
00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:05.041
So? Anybody wounded?

386
00:36:05.042 --> 00:36:07.166
I mean. seriously wounded? Killed?

387
00:36:07.167 --> 00:36:08.334
I don't know!

388
00:36:08.584 --> 00:36:09.584
Injured?

389
00:36:09.585 --> 00:36:10.958
No. but they tied everybody.

390
00:36:10.959 --> 00:36:14.251
So. don't meddle. Do you give a shit
about who you are working for?

391
00:36:15.001 --> 00:36:18.167
That's it. go home
and be back at work tomorrow morning.

392
00:36:18.584 --> 00:36:20.125
They beat up people.

393
00:36:20.126 --> 00:36:21.416
Pete. lock him up.

394
00:36:21.417 --> 00:36:24.666
What do you mean. lock me up?
What did I do?

395
00:36:24.667 --> 00:36:27.084
- Move it.
- Have a rest.

396
00:36:29.334 --> 00:36:34.084
Hey. listen. pal. this whole thing's
just gotten away from you.

397
00:36:36.042 --> 00:36:37.459
I'm in charge here.

398
00:36:38.459 --> 00:36:39.417
Ta-da!

399
00:36:39.667 --> 00:36:41.709
What's that? Here we are...

400
00:36:42.209 --> 00:36:47.876
Engineering department?
We need the backup generator.

401
00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:54.333
- Can we turn on the generators?
- Already done.

402
00:36:54.334 --> 00:36:59.041
Today the power is out.
yesterday they sealed up the weapons.

403
00:36:59.042 --> 00:37:02.708
And you keep things organized here.
in perfect working order?

404
00:37:02.709 --> 00:37:06.125
Vasiliy Mihailovich.
I'll tell my father about that.

405
00:37:06.126 --> 00:37:07.791
Usually. things are fine. but yesterday.

406
00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:10.375
they picked at us for no reason at all.

407
00:37:10.376 --> 00:37:13.542
About the records in the book.
the wrong guys carrying the wrong gun.

408
00:37:14.126 --> 00:37:15.584
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

409
00:37:19.834 --> 00:37:22.292
Let's move. Here it goes.

410
00:37:22.834 --> 00:37:24.376
What the fuck?

411
00:37:25.792 --> 00:37:29.166
Failure. Most likely the security
system restarted because of it.

412
00:37:29.167 --> 00:37:30.459
Most likely?

413
00:37:30.626 --> 00:37:33.167
It means the cameras are now functioning.

414
00:37:34.792 --> 00:37:36.667
Stanislav Olegovich!

415
00:37:37.376 --> 00:37:39.334
Look at this.

416
00:37:43.542 --> 00:37:45.459
How in the hell?

417
00:37:51.292 --> 00:37:56.416
All units!
We are under attack. the stairs.

418
00:37:56.417 --> 00:37:57.751
Roma. come with me.

419
00:38:03.917 --> 00:38:05.042
Door!

420
00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:16.667
Give me a minute.

421
00:38:20.667 --> 00:38:23.042
It's no use. We need to break the door.

422
00:38:28.167 --> 00:38:29.833
They hacked the security system.

423
00:38:29.834 --> 00:38:32.000
I warned you about computerization!

424
00:38:32.001 --> 00:38:34.500
We have no connection. Let's decide.

425
00:38:34.501 --> 00:38:39.375
Decide? We can't get away from here.
we are totally fucked!

426
00:38:39.376 --> 00:38:40.458
Don't panic!

427
00:38:40.459 --> 00:38:41.459
Yes!

428
00:38:42.334 --> 00:38:44.292
Who are these cheap thugs?

429
00:38:44.876 --> 00:38:47.458
They look like gym rats. 20 or 30 people.

430
00:38:47.459 --> 00:38:48.542
Maybe more.

431
00:38:48.917 --> 00:38:50.334
Perhaps. we fix this?

432
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:51.751
With the thugs?

433
00:38:54.667 --> 00:38:57.167
Yes. Pete. we could use a gun right now.

434
00:38:57.459 --> 00:38:58.584
They are unarmed.

435
00:38:59.084 --> 00:39:00.500
We should get ready for the fight.

436
00:39:00.501 --> 00:39:02.791
Are you going to fight? You're nuts!

437
00:39:02.792 --> 00:39:06.459
If we do what they say.
we can at least stay alive...

438
00:39:10.626 --> 00:39:12.041
I could use a bat.

439
00:39:12.042 --> 00:39:17.584
Gentlemen. I have a better offer.

440
00:39:17.792 --> 00:39:21.251
Well. spit it out.

441
00:39:42.001 --> 00:39:45.250
Well. sweeties. it's my turn.
Let me talk to them.

442
00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:46.959
We'll set it now.

443
00:39:48.084 --> 00:39:50.208
Gentlemen of the board. you wouldn't know.

444
00:39:50.209 --> 00:39:54.875
but I'm ready to purchase your business
at a reasonable cost.

445
00:39:54.876 --> 00:39:58.542
Stupid fuck.
I'll flush you down the toilet.

446
00:39:58.834 --> 00:40:02.084
Even if you shit all over me.
I'll still take what's mine.

447
00:40:02.542 --> 00:40:03.791
Surrender.

448
00:40:03.792 --> 00:40:06.501
Russians do not surrender.

449
00:40:12.584 --> 00:40:13.584
Stay right there!

450
00:40:13.585 --> 00:40:15.959
Come on. come over here!

451
00:40:18.126 --> 00:40:19.542
Pull him back!

452
00:41:02.292 --> 00:41:04.126
Get back here!

453
00:42:37.917 --> 00:42:41.126
Come on!

454
00:43:31.751 --> 00:43:32.959
Come on!

455
00:43:36.376 --> 00:43:41.126
Now what? You're done for. you jerk!

456
00:43:55.334 --> 00:43:57.792
That shot was cool! Yes!

457
00:43:59.042 --> 00:44:02.667
Come on. move it. go!

458
00:44:03.209 --> 00:44:04.417
What?

459
00:44:05.501 --> 00:44:07.291
It's my sword.

460
00:44:07.292 --> 00:44:09.542
Yours. Take it.

461
00:44:15.542 --> 00:44:17.791
Should I poke you once or twice?

462
00:44:17.792 --> 00:44:18.501
Got mixed up?

463
00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:19.501
Should I?

464
00:44:19.626 --> 00:44:21.917
You'll pay for this. punk!

465
00:44:23.042 --> 00:44:26.251
You seem to have forgotten
the rules of this game.

466
00:44:26.584 --> 00:44:29.541
Do you even know who you are messing with?

467
00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:32.125
So you are going to keep
all the food for yourself.

468
00:44:32.126 --> 00:44:33.458
Now you are our food.

469
00:44:33.459 --> 00:44:35.376
Stop. what are you doing?

470
00:44:36.126 --> 00:44:39.542
Here he is. the gentleman of the board.

471
00:44:39.917 --> 00:44:43.375
We are negotiating
from the stronger position.

472
00:44:43.376 --> 00:44:46.417
Pavel Andreevich.
please step inside the conference room.

473
00:44:52.084 --> 00:44:55.041
Nicely done. guys. it worked out.

474
00:44:55.042 --> 00:44:57.709
You were at your best. I'm impressed.

475
00:44:58.042 --> 00:45:02.626
Now the only thing we have left
is the paperwork. That is my field.

476
00:45:07.292 --> 00:45:08.667
And where is the CEO?

477
00:45:16.126 --> 00:45:20.209
Without the CEO's signature.
the transaction is not legal.

478
00:45:21.584 --> 00:45:23.084
Not legal?

479
00:45:29.084 --> 00:45:31.959
Not legal. no shit?

480
00:45:34.417 --> 00:45:37.917
No shit! Bring him to me!

481
00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:44.167
Two minutes.

482
00:45:51.501 --> 00:45:52.876
What's the drug called?

483
00:45:53.126 --> 00:45:55.001
I am afraid you'll get used to it.

484
00:46:07.334 --> 00:46:08.626
May I come in?

485
00:46:15.084 --> 00:46:19.459
So. let's get to transferring the shares.

486
00:46:20.584 --> 00:46:25.292
I'll use your ass for my wallet. Iokh.

487
00:46:25.959 --> 00:46:30.334
Lokh is a fish swimming upstream to spawn.

488
00:46:30.876 --> 00:46:32.541
In a similar fashion. you. gentlemen.

489
00:46:32.542 --> 00:46:35.501
did not notice that you are no longer
floating downstream.

490
00:46:36.084 --> 00:46:38.751
The '90s are long gone.

491
00:46:40.751 --> 00:46:44.084
This remarkable folder
will be of great interest

492
00:46:44.709 --> 00:46:48.292
to the district attorney.

493
00:46:48.751 --> 00:46:53.416
Blackmailing. embezzlement. larceny...

494
00:46:53.417 --> 00:46:56.291
And altogether.
with your organized crime syndicate.

495
00:46:56.292 --> 00:46:58.834
it will amount to 15 years
in high security.

496
00:46:59.209 --> 00:47:03.209
Time for you to spawn.

497
00:47:04.459 --> 00:47:06.708
gentlemen of the board!

498
00:47:06.709 --> 00:47:09.042
You are a rotten rat.

499
00:47:13.376 --> 00:47:15.084
There is a deadbolt here.

500
00:47:20.709 --> 00:47:25.292
I have a shotgun!
I'll kill anyone who enters this door.

501
00:47:32.459 --> 00:47:33.584
Down!

502
00:47:40.292 --> 00:47:42.708
You'll spit blood. all of you!

503
00:47:42.709 --> 00:47:45.666
How are you. brother? Did it hit you hard?

504
00:47:45.667 --> 00:47:48.126
So. where did this asshole get a shotgun?

505
00:47:49.459 --> 00:47:52.959
Take this! And be quiet!
Have you got that?

506
00:47:54.042 --> 00:48:00.126
Colonel. that busybody
from the neighborhood called again.

507
00:48:00.459 --> 00:48:02.251
He wants to report a shooting.

508
00:48:06.417 --> 00:48:07.876
At the liquor factory.

509
00:48:16.542 --> 00:48:18.667
Are these all the cameras? Are there more?

510
00:48:19.167 --> 00:48:20.792
I'm pulling them up right now.

511
00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:25.417
Can't see anybody here.

512
00:48:27.959 --> 00:48:29.626
What is he waving at?

513
00:48:37.084 --> 00:48:38.291
The intercom works?

514
00:48:38.292 --> 00:48:42.001
Colonel. shut down the light show.
the deal has been made.

515
00:48:42.334 --> 00:48:44.250
The transaction was supposed to be quiet.

516
00:48:44.251 --> 00:48:45.791
Everything's quiet.

517
00:48:45.792 --> 00:48:47.709
You've been reported. and believe me.

518
00:48:47.917 --> 00:48:50.709
this busybody will flip on you
even higher.

519
00:48:51.167 --> 00:48:54.458
Sergey Vicktorovich. I don't need trouble

520
00:48:54.459 --> 00:48:56.958
on account of your "everything's quiet".

521
00:48:56.959 --> 00:49:01.000
Alexander Vitalievich.
don't worry. I have it under control.

522
00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:04.750
Sasha. we're good.

523
00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:08.833
And everything is legal and legitimate?

524
00:49:08.834 --> 00:49:13.292
Go to hell! And take the pigs with you!

525
00:49:15.959 --> 00:49:17.041
Fucking scumbag.

526
00:49:17.042 --> 00:49:18.417
You're fucked.

527
00:49:19.042 --> 00:49:21.291
and you should have thought this through.

528
00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:25.126
- Tell Vasiliy to open the door.
- Let's just get out of here.

529
00:49:26.751 --> 00:49:32.625
Figure it out yourselves out there.
and I have to check on the allegation.

530
00:49:32.626 --> 00:49:36.208
The job was bigger than we thought.
they got you worried.

531
00:49:36.209 --> 00:49:37.917
but you will be compensated accordingly.

532
00:49:38.126 --> 00:49:40.083
Call the district office yourself.

533
00:49:40.084 --> 00:49:42.292
I will. don't be a suck-up.

534
00:49:42.584 --> 00:49:43.916
Punk.

535
00:49:43.917 --> 00:49:45.542
Bitch.

536
00:49:45.834 --> 00:49:47.708
Well. cut it out. it's not a day camp!

537
00:49:47.709 --> 00:49:50.709
We need to open the door.
You've got five minutes.

538
00:49:52.792 --> 00:49:54.501
There is a gun in there.

539
00:49:55.126 --> 00:49:56.834
Do what you're told.

540
00:49:58.251 --> 00:50:05.001
Fuck you. Open it yourself.
I'm fed up with you.

541
00:51:25.834 --> 00:51:27.209
Look...

542
00:51:29.251 --> 00:51:31.167
Great perfume.

543
00:51:32.126 --> 00:51:34.084
I don't want trouble.

544
00:51:36.001 --> 00:51:37.792
But trouble is already here.

545
00:51:41.501 --> 00:51:43.084
Hold it. soldier.

546
00:51:49.001 --> 00:51:52.542
That's our boss man.

547
00:51:59.501 --> 00:52:02.042
Are you hiding from the fracas. dodgy?

548
00:52:07.126 --> 00:52:09.167
Branching off from your commander?

549
00:52:11.667 --> 00:52:13.876
And now you decided to make some money?

550
00:52:16.834 --> 00:52:19.834
We've got our own law here.

551
00:53:40.376 --> 00:53:42.292
You've got some nerve!

552
00:54:56.667 --> 00:54:58.542
Fuck it...

553
00:55:22.751 --> 00:55:24.917
What a surprise.

554
00:55:34.334 --> 00:55:38.042
Vasiliy Mihailovich!

555
00:55:39.042 --> 00:55:40.792
Harder.

556
00:55:46.501 --> 00:55:49.334
You don't think this is over. do you?

557
00:55:49.626 --> 00:55:51.626
We shoot people like you point-blank.

558
00:55:53.042 --> 00:55:54.584
Fighting over a woman.

559
00:55:55.376 --> 00:55:57.876
All right then. bitch. dance!

560
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:30.501
Pull him over here. fuck it! Come on!

561
00:56:36.792 --> 00:56:38.417
Take this!

562
00:56:44.834 --> 00:56:47.709
And you can finally see
who's really the boss.

563
00:56:49.792 --> 00:56:52.126
All right. let's finish it.

564
00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:55.458
Vasiliy Mihailovich. you are looking

565
00:56:55.459 --> 00:56:57.958
at 1 <i>5</i> years in high security.

566
00:56:57.959 --> 00:57:00.708
For a person your age.
this is a death sentence.

567
00:57:00.709 --> 00:57:02.917
Does the factory
mean more to you than your life?

568
00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:27.834
Very well then.

569
00:57:28.126 --> 00:57:32.459
This beauty stays unharmed if you come out

570
00:57:32.667 --> 00:57:35.167
and sign the paperwork.

571
00:57:43.709 --> 00:57:46.709
He has no heart at all.
this Vasiliy Mihailovich.

572
00:57:52.209 --> 00:57:54.167
Strip naked.

573
00:58:10.251 --> 00:58:11.333
Let her go.

574
00:58:11.334 --> 00:58:13.292
Put down the weapon.

575
00:58:13.417 --> 00:58:19.209
Why? We all know
how things are going to go.

576
00:58:19.417 --> 00:58:22.126
Grandpa. you better
be fucking careful with that shotgun.

577
00:58:22.501 --> 00:58:23.376
Get out.

578
00:58:23.377 --> 00:58:24.917
Hold it!

579
00:58:27.001 --> 00:58:28.417
Stay still!

580
00:58:29.251 --> 00:58:30.876
Stay still. bitch!

581
00:58:37.209 --> 00:58:38.542
Thank you!

582
00:58:43.334 --> 00:58:45.083
What are you doing here?

583
00:58:45.084 --> 00:58:46.334
Put it down.

584
00:58:47.542 --> 00:58:48.917
Who are you?

585
00:58:50.626 --> 00:58:52.001
Nikita.

586
00:58:55.751 --> 00:58:57.417
It's not yours.

587
00:58:59.876 --> 00:59:01.209
it's my father's.

588
00:59:01.459 --> 00:59:02.958
It can't be true...

589
00:59:02.959 --> 00:59:05.625
Nikita. is it you?

590
00:59:05.626 --> 00:59:08.042
Look...

591
00:59:08.834 --> 00:59:10.875
Nikita. you disappeared
with your grandfather.

592
00:59:10.876 --> 00:59:12.417
and we thought...

593
00:59:16.334 --> 00:59:19.501
Do you realize it wasn't my fault?

594
00:59:19.959 --> 00:59:21.709
I know. Where is the warehouse?

595
00:59:21.959 --> 00:59:23.376
What warehouse?

596
00:59:23.751 --> 00:59:25.250
Nikita. why?

597
00:59:25.251 --> 00:59:26.333
The armory.

598
00:59:26.334 --> 00:59:28.917
You know full well about these people.

599
00:59:29.709 --> 00:59:32.125
Are you insane?

600
00:59:32.126 --> 00:59:35.042
Don't you remember
what they did to your father?

601
00:59:35.292 --> 00:59:36.376
Spill it!

602
00:59:36.751 --> 00:59:37.958
I'm saying nothing.

603
00:59:37.959 --> 00:59:39.209
You will.

604
00:59:41.292 --> 00:59:44.750
They will bury all of us.
both bandits and cops.

605
00:59:44.751 --> 00:59:46.334
It serves everybody right.

606
00:59:46.917 --> 00:59:48.667
I know where the weapons are.

607
00:59:49.334 --> 00:59:55.084
I was an assistant detective
with the police.

608
00:59:55.876 --> 00:59:58.959
We accidentally seized
a truck full of arms.

609
00:59:59.709 --> 01:00:02.459
We were working on the case.
and found some evidence.

610
01:00:02.959 --> 01:00:07.750
A month later. my boss disappeared.
the case was closed.

611
01:00:07.751 --> 01:00:08.791
and I was fired.

612
01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:10.291
Fanatic fool.

613
01:00:10.292 --> 01:00:12.334
This is how you treat people.

614
01:00:13.709 --> 01:00:16.083
You came to work here to spy on me.

615
01:00:16.084 --> 01:00:18.584
I'll destroy you!

616
01:00:20.709 --> 01:00:22.208
Revenge?

617
01:00:22.209 --> 01:00:23.917
Justice!

618
01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:29.667
Keep out of this.
You don't know these people.

619
01:00:30.292 --> 01:00:34.167
If I refused to cooperate.
I'd never see my family again.

620
01:00:34.459 --> 01:00:37.417
They will stop at nothing. ask this guy.

621
01:00:37.792 --> 01:00:40.084
That wanker ratted us out after all.

622
01:00:43.751 --> 01:00:45.792
Did you call them?

623
01:00:48.501 --> 01:00:52.416
Call them? Impossible.

624
01:00:52.417 --> 01:00:54.916
They show up on their own accord.

625
01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.125
Who are they?

626
01:00:56.126 --> 01:00:58.001
The ones you are looking for.

627
01:00:59.459 --> 01:01:01.542
Who the fuck are they?

628
01:01:06.334 --> 01:01:07.375
Colonel Ryabushkov.

629
01:01:07.376 --> 01:01:09.501
We have some business here.
Where are you from?

630
01:01:09.584 --> 01:01:10.917
From the head office.

631
01:01:12.334 --> 01:01:14.542
So. you got this call too.

632
01:01:17.876 --> 01:01:22.501
Stay out of it. Nikita.
Look at what happened to your father.

633
01:01:23.709 --> 01:01:24.916
They jammed the comms.

634
01:01:24.917 --> 01:01:26.542
Call the convoy.

635
01:01:28.626 --> 01:01:31.917
My father was a soldier. And who are you?

636
01:01:34.126 --> 01:01:35.626
Uncle Vasya.

637
01:01:48.417 --> 01:01:49.875
What a mess.

638
01:01:49.876 --> 01:01:51.291
Barricaded themselves in.

639
01:01:51.292 --> 01:01:53.084
Stuck in the '90s.

640
01:01:54.417 --> 01:01:58.125
Sanya. they have guns.

641
01:01:58.126 --> 01:01:59.833
Don't worry. I'll fix it.

642
01:01:59.834 --> 01:02:02.667
Will you? You should have
fixed it beforehand!

643
01:02:02.876 --> 01:02:05.584
You held this back
from your superiors. didn't you?

644
01:02:07.667 --> 01:02:10.209
Hey. you fucking call and fix this. fixer!

645
01:02:16.626 --> 01:02:17.959
Alexander...

646
01:02:20.251 --> 01:02:22.084
do you want a share of the factory?

647
01:02:48.292 --> 01:02:50.751
They have access to the system.

648
01:03:27.126 --> 01:03:30.042
Good evening. working people.

649
01:03:30.376 --> 01:03:34.126
What is going on here? Who can explain?

650
01:03:34.626 --> 01:03:38.626
Good evening. We are celebrating

651
01:03:39.084 --> 01:03:41.042
the successful completion of a deal.

652
01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:45.375
And who might you be?

653
01:03:45.376 --> 01:03:50.042
I am the owner's representative.
The new owner.

654
01:03:50.417 --> 01:03:54.583
Who are these bloody friends?
Shareholders?

655
01:03:54.584 --> 01:03:58.333
They are performers. Rappers.

656
01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.084
We want to see the CEO.

657
01:04:00.709 --> 01:04:04.792
I see you could question me for days.

658
01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:08.917
Please show me your credentials.

659
01:04:19.001 --> 01:04:21.042
I suppose you have a warrant

660
01:04:21.459 --> 01:04:24.584
or a factory security contract.
or something else?

661
01:04:25.126 --> 01:04:28.166
Alexander Vitalievich.
could you please explain to me

662
01:04:28.167 --> 01:04:30.251
what is going on here?

663
01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:38.376
Well. performers. show your bloody IDs.

664
01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:46.166
Chief. we are simple honest performers.
we rap just for pizza and kvass.

665
01:04:46.167 --> 01:04:47.583
Sit down.

666
01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:50.500
I don't have songs good enough
And I'm furious about this stuff

667
01:04:50.501 --> 01:04:53.375
I would be bored much less
Making the covers of tabloid press

668
01:04:53.376 --> 01:04:54.667
Be seated!

669
01:05:03.792 --> 01:05:07.709
Hey. put down the gun.
You fire. you go to prison.

670
01:05:08.459 --> 01:05:11.292
Take your boys.
and get the fuck out of here.

671
01:05:47.501 --> 01:05:49.376
Hey you. pompous prick.

672
01:07:19.084 --> 01:07:21.251
Bloody hell...

673
01:07:25.251 --> 01:07:26.917
What were you trying to do?

674
01:07:27.084 --> 01:07:30.084
You should have done what you were told.

675
01:07:50.084 --> 01:07:52.791
Get out of here.
Hurry up. there is no time.

676
01:07:52.792 --> 01:07:54.208
There's more of them coming.

677
01:07:54.209 --> 01:07:57.458
The gates are shut down.
you have to take the tunnel.

678
01:07:57.459 --> 01:07:59.334
Hold on! We are not finished yet here.

679
01:07:59.626 --> 01:08:01.958
Take hold of the CEO.
make him sign the papers.

680
01:08:01.959 --> 01:08:03.959
And I need the technician.

681
01:08:11.334 --> 01:08:12.709
You scumbag!

682
01:08:14.709 --> 01:08:16.501
So. no guns?

683
01:08:18.417 --> 01:08:21.666
That's how you solved the problem?

684
01:08:21.667 --> 01:08:24.583
Easy! It happens. a force majeure!
Let's finish the job.

685
01:08:24.584 --> 01:08:25.833
Fucking bitch.

686
01:08:25.834 --> 01:08:26.958
Stay put!

687
01:08:26.959 --> 01:08:29.583
Get back. This is my factory!

688
01:08:29.584 --> 01:08:32.292
Nobody leaves
until I get the CEO's signature.

689
01:08:32.792 --> 01:08:34.041
Follow the order!

690
01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:35.083
You set us up.

691
01:08:35.084 --> 01:08:36.417
Drop your weapons!

692
01:08:36.792 --> 01:08:37.916
Follow the order!

693
01:08:37.917 --> 01:08:39.292
You'll pay for this.

694
01:08:39.667 --> 01:08:41.709
Drop the weapon!

695
01:08:45.459 --> 01:08:47.500
We should get out of here.

696
01:08:47.501 --> 01:08:48.417
Drop your guns.

697
01:08:48.418 --> 01:08:49.667
Lieutenant.

698
01:08:52.084 --> 01:08:53.376
take a breath.

699
01:08:53.626 --> 01:08:57.208
Relax and put the gun away.
The most important thing now

700
01:08:57.209 --> 01:08:59.542
is to get everyone out of here. Agreed?

701
01:09:01.459 --> 01:09:04.792
Yes. let's do it.

702
01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:09.625
Untie everybody you've tied up before.

703
01:09:09.626 --> 01:09:11.500
There are buses near the second shop.

704
01:09:11.501 --> 01:09:13.500
we are going through the tunnel.

705
01:09:13.501 --> 01:09:15.376
Go with them.

706
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:34.250
Who are those people?

707
01:09:34.251 --> 01:09:37.125
Did you go behind our backs. fucking rat?

708
01:09:37.126 --> 01:09:39.709
They are the real owners of the factory.

709
01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:43.416
catch up with everybody
and get in the bus.

710
01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:44.458
Don't order us around.

711
01:09:44.459 --> 01:09:46.167
we'll figure it out on our own.

712
01:09:51.334 --> 01:09:53.417
Do you think he'll come?

713
01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:56.542
He will.

714
01:09:58.459 --> 01:09:59.709
Go.

715
01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:15.083
Sorry. guys. change of plans.
let's get out of here.

716
01:10:15.084 --> 01:10:16.542
Come on!

717
01:10:50.459 --> 01:10:54.209
Vasiliy Mihailovich. hurry up!

718
01:11:21.834 --> 01:11:23.084
Goodness.

719
01:11:49.876 --> 01:11:51.334
Bitches!

720
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:10.292
Anybody else want to shoot?

721
01:12:11.334 --> 01:12:13.917
Oh. dear Lord. have mercy...

722
01:12:21.667 --> 01:12:26.500
If there are no more volunteers.
throw out your guns.

723
01:12:26.501 --> 01:12:29.209
hands behind your head.
and get out of the bus.

724
01:12:50.084 --> 01:12:52.501
Howdy. Vasya! Come over here.

725
01:12:57.542 --> 01:12:58.876
Hands down.

726
01:13:04.042 --> 01:13:05.917
Why did you lie to your partner?

727
01:13:06.751 --> 01:13:08.667
You told me the tunnel was sealed up.

728
01:13:09.834 --> 01:13:11.333
This is hardly a partnership.

729
01:13:11.334 --> 01:13:13.292
For me. it worked.

730
01:13:14.917 --> 01:13:16.751
Who has been visiting my warehouse?

731
01:13:22.251 --> 01:13:25.459
Get all of them in the warehouse
and clean up the area.

732
01:13:30.876 --> 01:13:34.751
Why don't you speak. Vasya? I'm waiting.

733
01:14:01.126 --> 01:14:04.416
Grandpa. forgive me.
I can't come right now.

734
01:14:04.417 --> 01:14:05.917
The job is very important.

735
01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:08.125
I know how important your job is.

736
01:14:08.126 --> 01:14:10.876
It is a good thing
your father is not here to see this.

737
01:14:11.626 --> 01:14:14.958
Come on. Grandpa. I am a soldier.

738
01:14:14.959 --> 01:14:18.834
A soldier defends his home.

739
01:14:19.251 --> 01:14:23.126
If one doesn't have anything to defend.
he is a bandit.

740
01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:27.459
Think about it. Nikita. Take care.

741
01:14:52.501 --> 01:14:54.709
All loaded? Go.

742
01:15:04.001 --> 01:15:05.459
Sit down over here.

743
01:15:08.167 --> 01:15:09.292
How much longer?

744
01:15:09.334 --> 01:15:10.876
Fifteen minutes.

745
01:15:12.501 --> 01:15:14.001
So. gentlemen...

746
01:15:16.542 --> 01:15:18.250
I am asking you just once.

747
01:15:18.251 --> 01:15:20.292
Who organized this attack?

748
01:15:21.292 --> 01:15:23.042
You have ten seconds.

749
01:15:23.959 --> 01:15:27.834
I'll spare those who tell me the truth.
The clock's ticking.

750
01:15:28.542 --> 01:15:31.584
One. two...

751
01:15:33.417 --> 01:15:37.917
I take it. you are in charge here.
Guys. I am one of you...

752
01:15:44.417 --> 01:15:50.209
Gentlemen raiders...
You wanted to fight. right?

753
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:53.251
You're wounded.

754
01:15:56.459 --> 01:16:00.501
Come on. impress me.

755
01:16:01.667 --> 01:16:04.834
Down! You down! Get down!

756
01:16:05.501 --> 01:16:07.751
Cut his hands loose.

757
01:16:38.251 --> 01:16:40.417
You fight like a whore.

758
01:16:40.792 --> 01:16:44.626
So. in your barracks.
they only teach you cards?

759
01:16:52.126 --> 01:16:53.126
Down!

760
01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:12.667
Second squad! Over...

761
01:18:16.459 --> 01:18:18.667
Second squad. why don't you answer?

762
01:18:38.834 --> 01:18:41.000
- Is the task clear?
- Yes. sir.

763
01:18:41.001 --> 01:18:42.667
Then let's do it. guys.

764
01:19:18.334 --> 01:19:20.334
Nikita! I knew it.

765
01:19:25.167 --> 01:19:26.751
Thank you.

766
01:19:30.126 --> 01:19:31.501
Chief.

767
01:19:34.001 --> 01:19:37.501
don't you feel some remorse?

768
01:19:38.959 --> 01:19:41.084
Welcome to the war.

769
01:19:41.959 --> 01:19:45.166
If you're free. help others.

770
01:19:45.167 --> 01:19:46.708
What shall we do?

771
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:47.750
Are you okay?

772
01:19:47.751 --> 01:19:50.208
Everybody. get to the buses.

773
01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:51.542
Be safe.

774
01:19:53.167 --> 01:19:55.792
Move it! Go! Quickly.

775
01:19:58.209 --> 01:19:59.501
No pushing.

776
01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:40.376
Contact. Holy shit!
Kill this motherfucker!

777
01:20:45.792 --> 01:20:48.667
- I'm coming.
- I'll pin him down.

778
01:20:50.376 --> 01:20:52.584
- Go!
- Copy that.

779
01:20:53.876 --> 01:20:56.001
- Holding.
- I'll cover you.

780
01:20:58.042 --> 01:21:01.959
I'll pin him down.

781
01:21:24.917 --> 01:21:26.334
Grenade!

782
01:21:26.959 --> 01:21:28.626
Get down!

783
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:53.959
- Contact.
- I'll cover.

784
01:21:56.459 --> 01:21:57.667
Fuck it...

785
01:21:59.126 --> 01:22:01.042
For fuck's sake...

786
01:22:11.959 --> 01:22:13.042
Aim!

787
01:22:22.501 --> 01:22:24.834
Stand down. soldier. Leave him alone.

788
01:22:25.084 --> 01:22:26.876
I'm holding it. go.

789
01:22:38.667 --> 01:22:40.209
Go on.

790
01:22:46.251 --> 01:22:47.501
Go!

791
01:23:14.459 --> 01:23:16.791
What are you doing standing here?
We need to go.

792
01:23:16.792 --> 01:23:18.209
There's no time.

793
01:23:19.042 --> 01:23:20.250
I'm staying.

794
01:23:20.251 --> 01:23:24.209
Oh. another one. What for?

795
01:23:26.459 --> 01:23:27.583
All the guys are dead.

796
01:23:27.584 --> 01:23:30.584
Tell me about it! Guys! You...

797
01:23:33.376 --> 01:23:35.583
Right then... I'm staying with you.

798
01:23:35.584 --> 01:23:39.001
I've got my reasons. too.
And we should cover them.

799
01:23:41.042 --> 01:23:43.042
Come on! Go!

800
01:23:51.584 --> 01:23:53.375
What are you doing?

801
01:23:53.376 --> 01:23:55.667
I won't have it any other way.

802
01:24:58.626 --> 01:24:59.959
The door.

803
01:25:10.626 --> 01:25:12.292
I'm down.

804
01:25:15.876 --> 01:25:17.584
Man down!

805
01:25:20.251 --> 01:25:22.667
Contact. Closing in on them.

806
01:25:26.126 --> 01:25:27.417
Go on.

807
01:25:37.001 --> 01:25:38.459
Fire in the hole!

808
01:25:45.667 --> 01:25:48.542
Zero visibility. Careful.

809
01:26:02.292 --> 01:26:03.917
Check it out.

810
01:26:11.001 --> 01:26:12.834
I can't see a fucking thing.

811
01:26:19.126 --> 01:26:21.084
Contact. go!

812
01:26:22.917 --> 01:26:24.542
Fucking shit.

813
01:26:31.459 --> 01:26:33.209
Give me yours.

814
01:26:35.584 --> 01:26:37.209
Use yours.

815
01:26:39.626 --> 01:26:40.876
Take cover!

816
01:26:49.459 --> 01:26:51.042
Fuck it.

817
01:26:57.084 --> 01:27:00.084
Follow me. out. now.

818
01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:39.876
Hey. who's here?

819
01:27:40.876 --> 01:27:42.917
Nikita. is it you?

820
01:27:48.751 --> 01:27:50.126
Alive?

821
01:28:14.501 --> 01:28:18.459
Spread it out. Fire.

822
01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:23.959
Go on. don't stop. Close in on him.

823
01:28:24.501 --> 01:28:27.876
Go! Don't stop.

824
01:28:28.209 --> 01:28:33.126
Closer.

825
01:28:59.917 --> 01:29:05.167
Come on. guys! I'll cover you. go on!

826
01:29:06.834 --> 01:29:09.459
He is inside. I'll hold it.

827
01:29:54.834 --> 01:29:57.042
For the guys...

828
01:30:21.459 --> 01:30:23.126
Stay right there!

829
01:30:26.417 --> 01:30:28.626
Drop the guns.

830
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:46.709
Who the fuck are you. man?

831
01:30:47.126 --> 01:30:48.751
Call sign Yasha.

832
01:30:49.167 --> 01:30:50.751
Is this your job?

833
01:30:51.001 --> 01:30:51.959
Half-done.

834
01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.875
Why did you start World War Three here?

835
01:30:54.876 --> 01:30:56.792
Is there a better way to reach you?

836
01:30:57.001 --> 01:31:00.416
You're the Ghost after all...
Kind of evasive.

837
01:31:00.417 --> 01:31:04.333
Is it about money? No problem. I'll share.

838
01:31:04.334 --> 01:31:06.417
I need people like you.

839
01:31:08.126 --> 01:31:09.667
This is not about money.

840
01:31:10.251 --> 01:31:11.917
So. what do you want then?

841
01:31:12.917 --> 01:31:14.000
Justice.

842
01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:18.709
Justice? And who's going to judge? You?

843
01:31:20.209 --> 01:31:21.876
I won't judge.

844
01:31:26.459 --> 01:31:28.334
I will kill.

845
01:31:30.001 --> 01:31:33.084
You know. I like you. call sign Yasha.

846
01:35:53.626 --> 01:35:56.667
Nikita. are you okay?

847
01:35:59.376 --> 01:36:01.959
Let's go. we need to go.

848
01:36:02.667 --> 01:36:04.125
I am not going.

849
01:36:04.126 --> 01:36:06.709
Help me. I can't lift him.

850
01:36:07.542 --> 01:36:09.750
I'm taking you all into custody.

851
01:36:09.751 --> 01:36:11.209
How come?

852
01:36:14.959 --> 01:36:16.542
That's the right thing to do.

853
01:36:19.626 --> 01:36:21.167
No. it's wrong!

854
01:36:23.376 --> 01:36:26.542
He saved us all! He is not a criminal.

855
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:28.792
- Get up!
- No.

856
01:36:29.251 --> 01:36:30.875
Nikita. why?

857
01:36:30.876 --> 01:36:34.209
Don't you understand? Get up!
There's no time.

858
01:36:34.834 --> 01:36:38.042
We have to go. You can't stay here.

859
01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:41.376
If you stay. they'll kill you.

860
01:36:44.542 --> 01:36:46.334
That's why I came here.

861
01:36:48.376 --> 01:36:50.334
I'm done running.

862
01:36:54.751 --> 01:36:56.459
I am a soldier.
