00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.040
My name is Dmitri--

4
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.000
Speak English!

5
00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.240
Hands up!
Get out of the bed! Both of you!

6
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.520
Now. down the stairs.

7
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.800
Cooperate and nothing
will happen to you.

8
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.080
On your knees.

9
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.160
Now!

10
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.240
I love you.

11
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.680
You like it down here. don't you?

12
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.480
I love you.

13
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.960
Shut up! Stop talking to each other.

14
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.840
- I told you to shut up!
- I love you.

15
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.320
Say it one more time. I dare you.

16
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:40.840
I love you.

17
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.160
Volkov!

18
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.560
You fucking bastard!

19
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.800
Do you want to be next faggot?

20
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.120
- What is wrong with you?
- Shut your mouth.

21
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.400
Since when do you speak English?

22
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.880
Papa. How did you get this number?

23
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.160
I'm in the city. I'd like to see you.

24
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.120
I might not agree with you.

25
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.320
but I did not write the laws
that put you at risk.

26
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.960
Your mother misses you.
She worries about you.

27
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.480
Not knowing whether you're
alive or dead.

28
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.040
I know you think this is love.
but if they loved you.

29
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.520
they wouldn't put you in harm's way.

30
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.000
Tell me where you are.
I'll come get you.

31
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:22.880
I'm sorry.

32
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.120
I don't know how he got this number.

33
00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.000
The people I work for--

34
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.520
Sometimes I wonder if we'll make
it out of here alive.

35
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.400
The woman I clean for is a
massive bitch.

36
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.600
You should see the apartment.

37
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.280
If there weren't cameras everywhere.

38
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.920
I would have cooked for you
there tonight.

39
00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.280
It must be stressful having so much.

40
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.560
Always worrying if someone
will steal it from you.

41
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.120
At least we don't have to worry about that.

42
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.600
One of the women I clean with...

43
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.680
Her brother could only afford one jump.

44
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.560
but then they found someone to jump him.

45
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.840
his wife and their daughter.

46
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.000
The three of them together.

47
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.040
Wait.

48
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.280
Let him in.

49
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.960
Is this really the life you've chosen?

50
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.160
I thought you came to apologize.

51
00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.720
I know you think you're in love.

52
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.160
You forget. I grew up in your house.

53
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.160
I know what your version of love is.

54
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.920
You may be infatuated
with impossible romance.

55
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.240
but if she truly loved you.
she wouldn't drag you into this.

56
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.840
I know I don't have to tell you
what the authorities would do

57
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.600
if they found you.

58
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.000
Is this really worth the risk?

59
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.920
There's a man who can get us
passage to England.

60
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.760
Whomever has offered you this.
you can't trust them.

61
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.080
We will pay him.

62
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.200
With what money?

63
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.800
Is it wrong that I want to help you?

64
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.000
The authorities will kill you
if you don't come with me.

65
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.720
- You have to come with me.
- What have you done?

66
00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.280
It was only a matter of time
until they found you!

67
00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.800
What have you done?

68
00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.760
Stay down. Listen and obey.

69
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.320
What is this?

70
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.560
Where did it all come from?

71
01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.160
I'm not leaving you!

72
01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.200
We're not splitting.
We shouldn't split up.

73
01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.720
Don't tell me what to do.

74
01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:26.280
I think you should jump.
You speak better English.

75
01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.680
I'm afraid I'll never see you again.
