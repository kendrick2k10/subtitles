They're all really good kids.

368
00:22:02.103 --> 00:22:03.278
And they take care of
each other. you know?

369
00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:04.801
'Cause it's rough out there.

370
00:22:06.716 --> 00:22:09.066
And it's nice to have
someone who has your back.

371
00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:13.941
But we have a rule.

372
00:22:13.984 --> 00:22:16.552
You stay. you work.

373
00:22:16.596 --> 00:22:18.380
But if you work. we
take care of you.

374
00:22:24.038 --> 00:22:26.954
Hey. don't be so nervous.

375
00:22:26.997 --> 00:22:27.868
I'm not gonna hurt you.

376
00:22:30.087 --> 00:22:31.306
So what do you think?

377
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.916
You think you wanna stay
with us for a while?

378
00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:37.443
Good.

379
00:22:41.664 --> 00:22:42.491
Stand up for me.

380
00:22:43.797 --> 00:22:47.148
[ominous music]

381
00:22:47.191 --> 00:22:48.976
Look at you.

382
00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:55.156
Where do they even
get these dresses?

383
00:22:55.199 --> 00:22:57.071
Where is that store?

384
00:22:57.114 --> 00:22:58.942
I mean. is it like
a pioneer thing?

385
00:22:58.986 --> 00:23:00.422
It's so pervy.

386
00:23:00.466 --> 00:23:03.033
[ominous music]

387
00:23:10.824 --> 00:23:11.999
Don't be ashamed.

388
00:23:16.046 --> 00:23:17.308
You really are an angel.

389
00:23:23.053 --> 00:23:26.013
I have to ask. have you ever
even kissed someone before?

390
00:23:27.754 --> 00:23:28.407
No.

391
00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:44.161
Not so bad. huh?

392
00:23:45.119 --> 00:23:48.514
[ominous music]

393
00:23:48.557 --> 00:23:52.431
[Sadie] So. this whole
lot is exit 17.

394
00:23:52.474 --> 00:23:54.955
There's three stops
like ours on route 66.

395
00:23:54.998 --> 00:23:56.304
but if you're heading west.

396
00:23:56.347 --> 00:23:59.089
this is the last stop
for any quality action.

397
00:23:59.133 --> 00:24:00.613
If you wanna unbuckle
the bible belt.

398
00:24:00.656 --> 00:24:02.005
this is the place to do it.

399
00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:06.619
Good. clean. old-fashioned.
drug-free pussy.

400
00:24:06.662 --> 00:24:07.924
And dick.

401
00:24:07.968 --> 00:24:09.839
We have a bit of
a reputation here.

402
00:24:09.883 --> 00:24:10.753
and we're so proud of it.

403
00:24:10.797 --> 00:24:12.799
Hey. you know. Riley's mom.

404
00:24:12.842 --> 00:24:14.540
she worked exit 17.

405
00:24:14.583 --> 00:24:17.412
Gave it the nickname.
too. Candy Land.

406
00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:19.458
So there's four parts.

407
00:24:19.501 --> 00:24:21.982
The pit. Think of it
as a neighborhood.

408
00:24:22.025 --> 00:24:24.114
Yeah. you'd never just
walk up to any old house

409
00:24:24.158 --> 00:24:25.812
and knock on the door
at 3:00 AM and be like.

410
00:24:25.855 --> 00:24:28.249
"Hey. how's it going? You
want your cock sucked?"

411
00:24:28.292 --> 00:24:29.816
There's rules.

412
00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:32.035
If someone wants company.
they'll let you know.

413
00:24:33.428 --> 00:24:36.257
[Sadie] The first is simple.
back-in parking.

414
00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:40.043
Next is more of the same.

415
00:24:40.087 --> 00:24:41.262
if they flash their lights.

416
00:24:42.437 --> 00:24:44.308
Remember. they're
watching for you too.

417
00:24:45.658 --> 00:24:47.964
Next is the bathroom
cruisers. Levi?

418
00:24:48.008 --> 00:24:50.227
So your bathrooms are for
your thrill seekers. you know.

419
00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:53.230
not just about getting off.
but about not getting caught.

420
00:24:53.274 --> 00:24:55.015
Stalls around here
are most active

421
00:24:55.058 --> 00:24:56.799
in the afternoon
and the evening.

422
00:24:56.843 --> 00:25:00.150
I usually post up in the stall
at the end. against the wall.

423
00:25:00.194 --> 00:25:00.890
When someone comes in.

424
00:25:00.934 --> 00:25:02.370
[door squeaks open]

425
00:25:02.413 --> 00:25:04.154
you can tell a lot by
their body language.

426
00:25:04.198 --> 00:25:05.852
Do they go straight
to take a piss?

427
00:25:05.895 --> 00:25:07.418
[urine splashing]

428
00:25:07.462 --> 00:25:09.116
Do they bust through the
door and take a shit?

429
00:25:10.987 --> 00:25:11.945
[man farts]

430
00:25:11.988 --> 00:25:13.120
Or do they come in casually?

431
00:25:14.687 --> 00:25:17.385
And if they do. I
start to tap my foot.

432
00:25:17.428 --> 00:25:20.823
[boot tapping]

433
00:25:20.867 --> 00:25:24.784
If they tap back.
then it's game on.

434
00:25:26.046 --> 00:25:27.221
You know. and a lot of
these cats are not truckers.

435
00:25:27.264 --> 00:25:29.310
They're married men.
and proud of it too.

436
00:25:29.353 --> 00:25:31.051
They're just looking
for a little excitement.

437
00:25:32.182 --> 00:25:33.749
Who's that?

438
00:25:33.793 --> 00:25:36.317
That's Rex. Don't
worry about him.

439
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.187
Not unless you're Levi.

440
00:25:37.231 --> 00:25:38.754
[Levi] Mm-hm.

441
00:25:38.798 --> 00:25:40.147
[Liv] Babe. the radio.

442
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.017
Right. Go.

443
00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:42.845
So we use these.

444
00:25:42.889 --> 00:25:45.935
[static crackles]

445
00:25:45.979 --> 00:25:47.807
[Liv] We're listening
for our code words.

446
00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:48.634

headed for Candy Land.

450
00:25:58.252 --> 00:26:00.167
[Trucker On CB] I-9.
this is Hot-Karl

451
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.603
heading for Candy Land.

452
00:26:01.647 --> 00:26:03.213
Any lizards running today?

453
00:26:05.346 --> 00:26:06.390
33.

454
00:26:06.434 --> 00:26:07.827
So once they put
out the signal.

455
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.133
we have 'em flip over
to a private channel.

456
00:26:10.177 --> 00:26:11.744
and there. we make plans.

457
00:26:12.875 --> 00:26:15.617
Hot-Karl. what did
you have in mind?

458
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:22.537
[Sadie] And no matter what.
you always use one of these.

459
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:25.714
They'll beg you not to. but
don't be stupid like Levi.

460
00:26:25.758 --> 00:26:28.064
Or for an extra 40
bucks. you can always

-ride bare back.
-Stop.

462
00:26:29.152 --> 00:26:31.198
-Do not listen to him.
-It's...

463
00:26:31.241 --> 00:26:32.852
So what do you
think? You ready?

464
00:26:34.114 --> 00:26:34.984
Wait. now?

465
00:26:35.028 --> 00:26:36.333
[chuckles] No. I'm kidding.

466
00:26:36.377 --> 00:26:38.248
Relax. we're not
gonna start you here.

467
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.038
So. this is your room.

468
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.867
Liv was nice enough
to move in with Sadie

469
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.956
so that you could
have it for yourself.

470
00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.873
Do whatever you want with
it. Make it your own.

471
00:26:54.787 --> 00:26:56.527
And I got you something.

472
00:26:59.313 --> 00:27:01.054
Why don't you try it on.

473
00:27:01.097 --> 00:27:03.317

Wow. You look
like a real woman.

480
00:28:41.197 --> 00:28:41.981
How do you feel?

481
00:28:43.243 --> 00:28:44.810
[Remy] I feel okay.

482
00:28:44.853 --> 00:28:46.376
[Nora] Great. I'm so
glad to hear it.

483
00:28:47.464 --> 00:28:49.510
We have a guy
coming to see you.

He's a really nice man.

in here who aren't.

you know. people we trust.

488
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.044
It is okay to be a
little nervous and shy.

489
00:29:02.088 --> 00:29:03.524
That's fine. It's normal.

490
00:29:05.526 --> 00:29:09.704
But I know that
deep down inside.

491
00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:12.489
there's a woman who
is dying to come out.

492

to enjoy yourself.

00:47:03.951 --> 00:47:05.561
Ill.

729
00:47:05.605 --> 00:47:09.391
And when that happened. she
changed. Her mind changed.

730
00:47:12.133 --> 00:47:14.309
She became barbaric.

731
00:47:14.353 --> 00:47:16.572
with no mercy for
the dissenters.

732
00:47:18.096 --> 00:47:20.489
Now I've made peace with
her since she left us.

733
00:47:20.533 --> 00:47:22.796
and I am grateful for the
life that she showed me.

734
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.843
and that is why I feel I
owe the same debt to you.

735
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:34.155
We are not here to cleanse
the dissenters of the world.

736
00:47:34.721 --> 00:47:39.378
We are here to cleanse
ourselves of this world.

737
00:47:41.162 --> 00:47:43.948
and when we are cleansed.
then we will leave it.

738
00:47:49.605 --> 00:47:50.519
Theo.

739
00:47:52.434 --> 00:47:56.699
Your mind has
always been so small.

740
00:47:58.745 --> 00:48:02.575
Ye shall tear down
their altars. Theo.

741
00:48:03.793 --> 00:48:06.666
rip down their sacred
constructs. and burn them.

742
00:48:08.102 --> 00:48:10.409
cut down the images
of their gods.

743
00:48:10.452 --> 00:48:12.498
and erase their
memories of this place.

744
00:48:14.108 --> 00:48:15.327
You know this.

745
00:48:17.024 --> 00:48:18.939
You are so lost.

746
00:48:18.983 --> 00:48:20.985
We must be the ones
to drive the stakes

747
00:48:21.028 --> 00:48:22.551
into their hands
and their feet.

748
00:48:22.595 --> 00:48:24.553
for they cannot
do it themselves.

749
00:48:26.033 --> 00:48:28.601
We must cleanse the world
before we can cleanse

750
00:48:28.644 --> 00:48:31.473
-ourselves of it.
-Stop it.

751
00:48:31.517 --> 00:48:32.735
Stop it. please.

752
00:48:35.564 --> 00:48:37.740
I just came here to tell
you that we are leaving.

753
00:48:39.612 --> 00:48:40.700
The other elders and myself.

754
00:48:40.743 --> 00:48:42.789
we have decided that it is time.

755
00:48:52.538 --> 00:48:53.931
When?

756
00:48:53.974 --> 00:48:54.932
Tomorrow morning.

757
00:48:58.674 --> 00:49:01.547
And I know that we asked
for your withdrawal.

758
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:04.680
and I know that our
beliefs are not the same.

759
00:49:04.724 --> 00:49:06.247
but deep inside you. Remy.

760
00:49:06.291 --> 00:49:08.336
there is a light so bright.

761
00:49:09.772 --> 00:49:12.036
And I know that. And
so does the Lord.

762
00:49:13.211 --> 00:49:15.691
And we just thought
that we owed you

763
00:49:15.735 --> 00:49:17.476
the opportunity
to come with us.

764
00:49:23.134 --> 00:49:24.526
You know where to find us.

765
00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.575
Say goodbye to your sister.

766
00:49:33.144 --> 00:49:34.972
Hey.

767
00:49:35.015 --> 00:49:35.842
How are you?

768
00:49:35.885 --> 00:49:36.625
Good.

769
00:49:36.669 --> 00:49:37.539
Good.

770
00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:39.280
Theo says we're leaving soon.

771
00:49:41.674 --> 00:49:42.588
Are you coming with us?

772
00:49:45.852 --> 00:49:46.984
I'll think about it.

773
00:49:48.507 --> 00:49:49.595
Come. Jonah. It's time.

774
00:49:52.076 --> 00:49:53.120
It's time. Let's go.

775
00:50:01.041 --> 00:50:03.609
[ominous music]

776
00:50:43.779 --> 00:50:44.563
Father.

777
00:50:48.132 --> 00:50:52.484
Father...I am ready for you.

778
00:50:55.443 --> 00:50:56.227
[Remy] Use me.

779
00:50:57.228 --> 00:50:59.752
[ominous music continues]

780
00:51:02.668 --> 00:51:05.627
Guide my hands to
do your bidding.

781
00:51:12.765 --> 00:51:13.635
I am ready.

782
00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:27.084
How come...your legs are--

783
00:51:27.127 --> 00:51:28.520
I shaved today.

784
00:51:28.563 --> 00:51:32.350
Alright. well. yeah. but
like when it's. like. cold.

785
00:51:32.393 --> 00:51:35.527
like. my hair just grows
back so fucking fast.

786
00:51:36.832 --> 00:51:38.791
Like. yours are all smooth.

787
00:51:38.834 --> 00:51:39.618
Look at mine.

788
00:51:39.661 --> 00:51:40.532
These are nice.

789
00:51:40.575 --> 00:51:41.707
No. I have strawberry legs.

790
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:44.057
What?! What's a
strawberry leg?

791
00:51:44.101 --> 00:51:45.537
I have. like.
black dots on my legs.

792
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:47.016
so when I shave. and it.

793
00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:49.018
it's just. like. it
always looks hairy.

794
00:51:50.498 --> 00:51:52.370
It's really unbecoming.

795
00:51:52.413 --> 00:51:53.327
It's really--

796
00:51:54.328 --> 00:51:55.329
[Remy] Hey.

797
00:51:55.373 --> 00:51:56.852
[Sadie] Only you
would notice that.

798
00:51:56.896 --> 00:51:57.679
Hey.

799
00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.812
Is everything okay?

800
00:52:01.118 --> 00:52:02.119
Everything's okay.

801
00:52:03.294 --> 00:52:04.077
You want a smoke?

802
00:52:04.121 --> 00:52:05.426
No. I'm okay. Thank you.

803
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:06.645
Okay.

804
00:52:06.688 --> 00:52:08.037
We'll break you down
though. soon enough.

805
00:52:08.081 --> 00:52:10.388
[Levi] Oh. Sadie-bug. let me
get your cigarette.

806

Yeah. I'm okay. Thanks.

[truck horn blares]

Heads up.

810
00:52:27.753 --> 00:52:29.146
Oh. man. I just sat down.

811
00:52:29.189 --> 00:52:30.973
I'm gonna go get
something to eat.

812
00:52:31.017 --> 00:52:32.584
No. no.

813
00:52:32.627 --> 00:52:33.672
I need to eat.

814
00:52:34.499 --> 00:52:35.195
I need--

815
00:52:35.239 --> 00:52:36.327
Don't do that!

816
00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:37.937
And my fucking feet. too.

817
00:52:41.375 --> 00:52:42.811
Well. who's gonna go?

818
00:52:42.855 --> 00:52:43.638
I'm not going.

819
00:52:46.554 --> 00:52:47.729
Hey. why don't you go down?

820
00:52:47.773 --> 00:52:48.948
Riley. fuck me.

for the pit. okay?

Hold on.

825
00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:00.960
Yeah. I can do it.

826

[Riley] Yeah?

827

-Yeah.
-Are you sure?

Mm-hm.

829
