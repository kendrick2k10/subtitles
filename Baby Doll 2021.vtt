00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.300
This is a fat beat! Don't you think Stoli?

4
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.793
Yeah he really likes it.

5
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.403
There. I fixed it!

6
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.722
[screaming]

7
00:00:40.747 --> 00:00:41.793
[thud]

8
00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:45.691
Are you okay?

9
00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:57.113
[screaming]

10
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.396
Why are we screaming and jumping?

11
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.474
Because. we're going to Hollywood!

12
00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.958
Screaming continues

13
00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:11.910
Wait wait. how did you get this audition?

14
00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:17.543
I sent my pictures online and
I got electronic email for audition in Hollywood.

15
00:01:17.568 --> 00:01:21.006
We've been saving since we were kids to get
out of this place and go to Hollywood but

16
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.457
we barely have more
than enough to get there.

17
00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:28.357
Anya money is not a problem
once we go into Hollywood.

18
00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:32.175
[screaming continues]

19
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.871
Wait! Whats the part?

20
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.461
It's a very important part.

21
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:39.128
It is 'Beautiful Russia
Girl Number One'.

22
00:01:39.153 --> 00:01:40.951
You mean beautiful Russian girl number one?

23
00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:43.582
No! Beautiful Russia girl number one.

24
00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:46.660
That sounds like an important part. I can't argue with that.

25
00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:50.168
Then we are really going to Hollywood bitches?

26
00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:54.192
[screaming]

27
00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:56.100
I don't know if we are ready.

28
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.091
Of course we're ready. I got an audition.
I'm gonna be the next Marilyn Monroe!

29
00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:03.498
I am going to be in big. American movie.
Can you believe it. Anya?

30
00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.646
Hollywood! Hollywood!

31
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.787
Okay . we're definitely going!

32
00:02:18.812 --> 00:02:20.714
[screaming continues]

33
00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:29.766
I can't wait until we arrive in
Hollywood for my important audition.

34
00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:32.575
in big American movie.

35
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.941
Actually. for our auditions.

36
00:02:36.064 --> 00:02:36.808
What?

37
00:02:37.126 --> 00:02:41.461
Lalya and I went online and we submitted
photos of ourselves for the part

38
00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:43.541
and they're giving
us auditions too.

39
00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:48.011
No! 'Beautiful Russian Girl
Number One' is my part for me.

40
00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:49.845
I'm beautiful Russian girl!

41
00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.659
Look Natasha I
thought if we all audition.

42
00:02:52.684 --> 00:02:55.067
there will be three times
more chance of getting the job

43
00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:57.594
so we can afford to rent
a little place in Hollywood.

44
00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:02.313
No! You just stole my Beautiful Russia Girl Number One.
You just stold it!

45
00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:05.054
Look Natasha what about this?

46
00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.401
We will audition for the beautiful
Russian girl number 2 or 3 or something.

47
00:03:10.088 --> 00:03:12.444
We'll tell them but we better
do that when we get there.

48
00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:13.531
Will it work with you?

49
00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:18.031
It could probably work but I must be number one.

50
00:03:18.056 --> 00:03:19.469
Come on lets do that!

51
00:03:20.494 --> 00:03:21.533
Okay! Lets do it!

52
00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:27.095
I cant wait until we get to America
where we could live in a gansta paradise.

53
00:03:27.224 --> 00:03:29.011
Its gonna so G.

54
00:03:29.036 --> 00:03:34.677
BGB. BOC. BBC. CPC.
[laughing]

55
00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:39.109
So why are we still here?

56
00:03:39.134 --> 00:03:41.704
We have to get ready! Come on. get up!

57
00:04:22.738 --> 00:04:24.158
Ooh! Turbulence!

58
00:04:24.183 --> 00:04:25.933
I felt that in my stomach!

59
00:04:26.652 --> 00:04:28.769
I hope there is much more turbulence.

60
00:04:31.847 --> 00:04:32.800
[barks]

61
00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:34.181
Stoli! No!

62
00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:38.782
Sorry. Sorry. yo.

63
00:04:42.976 --> 00:04:44.414
Sorry. sorry.

64
00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:45.633
[Stage whispering.] Stoli!

65
00:04:48.594 --> 00:04:49.617
Stoli?

66
00:04:52.027 --> 00:04:54.910
Ow! What the fuck? Stewardess!

67
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.401
Mr. Don Carlo!

68
00:04:56.932 --> 00:04:58.932
I am so sorry your travel
is being interrupted--

69
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.439
Who's damn rat is this!

70
00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:03.056
Stoli is no rat!
He is legit dog!

71
00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:06.751
Touch him and I will
bust a cap in your ass!

72
00:05:06.937 --> 00:05:09.476
I'm sorry. I will take her back to seat. No problem here.

73
00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:11.765
- No problem? This suit was worn by James Bond...
- Haters!

74
00:05:12.148 --> 00:05:13.164
Oh. you know what?

75
00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:14.875
Dogs are not
allowed on the plane.

76
00:05:15.007 --> 00:05:16.991
I'm sorry. but there is a dog right there!

77
00:05:17.202 --> 00:05:21.193
Mr. Kissyface is a frequent flyer
who has paid for his own seat.

78
00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:22.656
Thank you very much.

79
00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:25.179
Oh. my precious little...

80
00:05:27.502 --> 00:05:30.353
Listen stewardess. why don't
you leave that girl's dog alone?

81
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:32.229
- But--
- Look. what are you gonna do?

82
00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:35.902
You gonna open up a window at fifty
million feet. sucking us all out into space

83
00:05:35.927 --> 00:05:38.018
where our heads explode
and we die? Come on..

84
00:05:38.133 --> 00:05:40.933
We're flying at the height of thirty-five thousand feet.

85
00:05:41.336 --> 00:05:44.353
What are you. an astronaut or something?
I know how high we're flying.

86
00:05:44.378 --> 00:05:47.062
Who called you over here
anyway. stewardess? Come on.

87
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.333
I'm a flight attendant.

88
00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:53.163
Thank you

89
00:05:53.655 --> 00:05:55.061
Yeah! No Problem!

90
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.171
No problem.

91
00:06:01.752 --> 00:06:03.614
- Turbulence.
- Yeah?

92
00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.775
Mr. Kissyface and I didn't feel any turbulence.

93
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.589
Yeah?

94
00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:12.024
Well no one cares what you or
Mr. Kissyface think alright?

95
00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:13.887
So why don't you keep your yaps shut.

96
00:06:14.204 --> 00:06:17.715
unless you plan playing tonsil
hockey again with the pooch.

97
00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:22.397
Sorry about that Ms.. uh?

98
00:06:23.148 --> 00:06:24.189
Natasha.

99
00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:25.446
Natasha.

100
00:06:26.827 --> 00:06:27.760
It's a pleasure.

101
00:06:29.342 --> 00:06:30.967
Please. join me.

102
00:06:33.067 --> 00:06:35.279
Lucky you have empty seat next to you.

103
00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:37.879
No luck at all.

104
00:06:38.294 --> 00:06:41.254
I always buy an extra
seat when I travel.

105
00:06:41.676 --> 00:06:45.231
You know. just in case I meet
someone worth traveling with.

106
00:06:54.733 --> 00:06:56.038
What are you doing?

107
00:06:57.405 --> 00:07:00.148
Letting sexy wind blow hair?

108
00:07:01.173 --> 00:07:04.321
I am like Russian
Marilyn Monroe. don't you think?

109
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.628
Hey.

110
00:07:09.653 --> 00:07:11.390
Hey I think you've
got the wrong seat.

111
00:07:11.415 --> 00:07:13.849
My wife actually just went
to the bathroom real quick.

112
00:07:13.874 --> 00:07:18.731
I think she's coming back in like two
seconds. Just so you know. so if you can--

113
00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:25.004
Can I help you?

114
00:07:26.082 --> 00:07:27.792
I like your bling!

115
00:07:27.957 --> 00:07:28.519
My...

116
00:07:29.067 --> 00:07:31.458
No this is not. its a wedding ring.

117
00:07:31.674 --> 00:07:34.518
For my wife who's coming back in two seconds.

118
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.226
So if you can move seats
for me that would be...

119
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:38.946
I want to be one of you.

120
00:07:39.183 --> 00:07:40.933
Uh. one of what? Uhm...

121
00:07:41.246 --> 00:07:42.246
As a rapper.

122
00:07:43.434 --> 00:07:46.167
No.. um. what kind of racist
shit is.. no I'm not a rapper.

123
00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:49.659
Alright just because I'm black doesn't
make a rapper. I'm a business man.

124
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.759
You are my brotha
from anotha motha. G!

125
00:07:52.784 --> 00:07:54.573
Can I spit on your next album?

126
00:07:54.598 --> 00:07:56.215
No. please. Please don't.

127
00:07:56.308 --> 00:07:59.267
I don't want you spitting on
anything that I own. At all. No.

128
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:01.823
I got hoes in different area codes.

129
00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:04.900
my homie. my dawg. my nigga--

130
00:08:04.925 --> 00:08:06.206
Hey. hey! What?

131
00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:07.518
What the hell did you just say to me?

132
00:08:07.543 --> 00:08:08.821
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

133
00:08:08.846 --> 00:08:11.493
Sorry nothing. Better get your ass back over
there before you see a real nigga today!

134
00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:14.494
- Move back. Move back. Move back.
- Sorry. Sory. Sorry. yo.

135
00:08:16.088 --> 00:08:17.947
Whoops! Sorry. sorry.

136
00:08:20.252 --> 00:08:21.141
What happened?

137
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.861
I met a real rapper.

138
00:08:23.284 --> 00:08:24.564
Stewardess!

139
00:08:24.745 --> 00:08:26.948
I sat in his bitch's seat.

140
00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:30.033
Where's Natasha?

141
00:08:30.907 --> 00:08:32.054
Yeah. yeah.

142
00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:34.130
I’m like a Francis
Ford Coppola and

143
00:08:34.155 --> 00:08:37.194
Steven Speilberg all rolled into
one with a little Jerry Bruckheimer.

144
00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:39.274
- I didn't know that!
- Yeah...

145
00:08:40.024 --> 00:08:41.313
Listen uhm...

146
00:08:41.844 --> 00:08:42.539
Here.

147
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.600
Take this.

148
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.100
What is this?

149
00:08:47.057 --> 00:08:49.111
You can use it to get
anything you want.

150
00:08:49.213 --> 00:08:50.543
You and your friends.

151
00:08:50.783 --> 00:08:52.533
Uhh. it's like credit card?

152
00:08:53.229 --> 00:08:54.984
[Chuckles.]

153
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:57.014
Yeah. yeah. It's like credit card.

154
00:08:57.962 --> 00:08:59.353
Anything you want.

155
00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:02.556
I must show my girls!
May I show it to girls?

156
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:03.349
Absolutely!

157
00:09:10.565 --> 00:09:12.096
Oh my God.

158
00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:15.200
She's dumb as a box of retarded hammers.

159
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.033
[snaps]
Just what I needed.

160
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.630
Hi.

161
00:09:28.433 --> 00:09:29.964
He's dumber than I thought.

162
00:09:29.989 --> 00:09:30.878
What is that?

163
00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.436
This is like a credit card.

164
00:09:32.576 --> 00:09:34.520
Oh my god. is that a black card?

165
00:09:34.545 --> 00:09:35.262
What does that mean?

166
00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:37.636
It's like Jay-Z has. No limit.

167
00:09:42.629 --> 00:09:43.967
This isn't right.

168
00:09:43.992 --> 00:09:46.879
By the way Lalya I think I saw a real rapper overthere.

169
00:09:46.904 --> 00:09:47.858
I know.

170
00:09:55.904 --> 00:09:57.654
Bravo! Bravo!

171
00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:14.446
Are you with the hospitality crew?

172
00:10:24.376 --> 00:10:27.108
Where is it?

173
00:10:28.469 --> 00:10:30.586
Are you playing on a pogo stick or something overthere?

174
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.967
I'm not playing.

175
00:10:42.422 --> 00:10:45.384
Don. for the last time.

176
00:10:45.626 --> 00:10:46.915
Where is it!?

177
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.143
Did you lose something?

178
00:10:52.168 --> 00:10:56.110
I mean. you know. besides from the hormones
that you need to grow outside puberty.

179
00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:03.222
Search it again.

180
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.011
We did search it again. We have to let him go.

181
00:11:13.448 --> 00:11:14.838
Ow! Watch it!

182
00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:16.772
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:16.797 --> 00:11:19.862
I thought I was loosening
instead of tightening.

184
00:11:20.143 --> 00:11:20.967
Ow!

185
00:11:24.467 --> 00:11:25.510
You're free to go.

186
00:11:30.534 --> 00:11:31.211
Don!

187
00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:35.229
Welcome to Los Angeles.

188
00:11:46.975 --> 00:11:47.655
Look!

189
00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:51.195
It is probably the
American way of say hello.

190
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.967
Be careful Anya.

191
00:11:57.367 --> 00:11:59.796
People over here are so kind and welcoming!

192
00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:03.633
Look! Film makers with my name on sign!

193
00:12:04.711 --> 00:12:06.290
Where is sign with my name?

194
00:12:06.933 --> 00:12:10.140
I must be the first choice for
'Beautiful Russian Girl Number One'.
[kiss]

195
00:12:10.584 --> 00:12:15.982
I'll show you who is first choice for
'Beautiful Russia Girl Number One'.
[kiss]

196
00:12:16.177 --> 00:12:19.037
First show me where the sign with your name is.

197
00:12:20.794 --> 00:12:21.567
Anya!

198
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.700
Saratova?

199
00:12:29.752 --> 00:12:32.737
How come I get harassed every
time I get to the fucking airport?

200
00:12:32.762 --> 00:12:35.073
Profiling because you're an
Italian man named Don?

201
00:12:35.914 --> 00:12:36.851
Shut up!

202
00:12:39.771 --> 00:12:42.146
Maybe it's because you actually
are involved in organized crime.

203
00:12:42.171 --> 00:12:43.442
We gotta follow that limo!

204
00:12:43.674 --> 00:12:44.869
- Yes Sir!
- Shut up!

205
00:12:45.333 --> 00:12:46.873
When do we arrive at the crib?

206
00:12:47.177 --> 00:12:49.262
Or do we go
straight to the studio?

207
00:12:50.801 --> 00:12:52.145
Stop it. they're watching you.

208
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.118
Of course they
are looking at me.

209
00:12:54.143 --> 00:12:56.893
I am the muckety-muck of
a big. important movie now.

210
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.428
Muckety-muck?

211
00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:00.053
Muckety-muck. big pimping.

212
00:13:00.093 --> 00:13:03.053
mothafucka. boss. diva. the shit. Got it?

213
00:13:07.436 --> 00:13:08.858
I don't know where we're going.

214
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.365
Hello?

215
00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.459
What do you mean?
I'm in the limo with--

216
00:13:17.842 --> 00:13:18.920
Driver!

217
00:13:19.552 --> 00:13:21.248
Stop the car.

218
00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:26.060
You are not Saratova!

219
00:13:26.462 --> 00:13:27.775
She is Saratova.

220
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.892
Katherine Saratova?

221
00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:31.275
No! Lalya Saratova.

222
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.756
Are you Saratova?

223
00:13:34.133 --> 00:13:35.733
Beautiful Russian girls.

224
00:13:36.333 --> 00:13:38.950
You are one big mistake!

225
00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:44.686
I see girls like you
come to LA in patterns.

226
00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:48.778
This town will eat you up and spit you out.

227
00:13:50.472 --> 00:13:51.307
[yelling]

228
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.409
Next time. don't just
get into someone's car!

229
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.351
My purse! Stop! Stop!

230
00:14:12.922 --> 00:14:14.297
Stoli!

231
00:14:15.656 --> 00:14:17.336
Stoli is in there!

232
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.914
Im so sorry Lalya

233
00:14:21.209 --> 00:14:24.084
Are you sorry beautiful Russian girl number one?

234
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.591
Don Carlo!

235
00:14:36.133 --> 00:14:37.758
Can I give you girls a lift?

236
00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:43.036
I mean. you know. unless this little
slice of heaven is your final destination?

237
00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:45.594
Sure!

238
00:14:50.698 --> 00:14:53.695
Weren't we warned a minute
ago not to get into someone's car?

239
00:14:54.094 --> 00:14:56.156
Anya come on! You preffer stay here?

240
00:14:57.149 --> 00:15:00.296
Am I the only one who remembers the
airport security taking this man away?

241
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.226
I wouldn't get in that car baby!

242
00:15:04.258 --> 00:15:06.208
You can stay here with me.

243
00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.009
I don't go. I don't go..

244
00:15:10.774 --> 00:15:12.907
You can stay here with me!

245
00:15:23.867 --> 00:15:27.929
...so I told her I'm an expert at
fitting big things in little spaces.

246
00:15:33.211 --> 00:15:34.765
Hey pig dropping! Why are we turning?

247
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.896
You're suppose to stay on the road!

248
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.406
There's a detour.

249
00:15:37.765 --> 00:15:40.913
They're always working on the
roads but they never get any better.

250
00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:42.062
You know?

251
00:15:42.601 --> 00:15:43.390
Yeah.

252
00:15:48.708 --> 00:15:50.506
Okay. now why are we stopping?

253
00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.468
A construction worker has stopped us.

254
00:15:54.331 --> 00:15:56.069
He wants us to get out of the car.

255
00:15:56.333 --> 00:15:57.620
Nobody's getting out of the car.

256
00:15:58.059 --> 00:16:00.002
Don't worry girls. It's okay. it's alright.

257
00:16:00.228 --> 00:16:02.469
Turn the car around and get
us the hell out of here now.

258
00:16:06.597 --> 00:16:07.645
Shit.

259
00:16:08.004 --> 00:16:09.108
[gunshots]

260
00:16:09.133 --> 00:16:10.840
[screams]

261
00:16:12.617 --> 00:16:14.374
[gunshots]

262
00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:15.601
Did you die on me?

263
00:16:25.868 --> 00:16:27.930
[screaming continues]

264
00:16:29.666 --> 00:16:30.557
Shit!

265
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.025
Please.

266
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.833
I thought I was in heaven.

267
00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.673
I thought I was in heaven
until you popped that bubble.

268
00:17:10.233 --> 00:17:11.293
What time is it?

269
00:17:17.952 --> 00:17:19.850
I have to be on
time for audition.

270
00:17:21.118 --> 00:17:22.970
This is all your fault!

271
00:17:23.233 --> 00:17:24.631
My fault?

272
00:17:26.086 --> 00:17:28.822
You... You got us in wrong car

273
00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:31.313
and kicked out in
middle of nowhere!

274
00:17:31.477 --> 00:17:32.563
Leave her alone. Natasha.

275
00:17:32.588 --> 00:17:35.007
She just thought it was
a pick up for the movie.

276
00:17:35.575 --> 00:17:36.773
Why would movie pick her?

277
00:17:36.798 --> 00:17:39.397
She is not 'Beautiful Russia
Girl Number One' material!

278
00:17:39.422 --> 00:17:40.282
No?

279
00:17:40.447 --> 00:17:41.219
No!

280
00:17:41.244 --> 00:17:43.103
I'm definitely not in heaven.

281
00:17:43.322 --> 00:17:46.220
If we miss the audition.
it will be your bad. yo.

282
00:17:46.294 --> 00:17:49.150
You are the one who got us
involved with that Don Carlo thug!

283
00:17:49.228 --> 00:17:49.978
Puto.

284
00:17:50.086 --> 00:17:54.335
Only because your dog ran
in first class and bit his ankle!

285
00:17:54.609 --> 00:17:55.546
Where are you going?

286
00:17:55.812 --> 00:17:56.937
See where we are.

287
00:17:57.437 --> 00:17:59.437
But there could be murderers right outside that door.

288
00:17:59.462 --> 00:18:01.984
I hope there are. Walk out there. bitch!

289
00:18:02.745 --> 00:18:05.354
If they wanted us dead
we would be dead already.

290
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.423
Wow. She actually makes a good point here.

291
00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:17.665
Whoah! Where do you think you're going?

292
00:18:18.985 --> 00:18:21.642
I'm looking for the ladies place.

293
00:18:22.494 --> 00:18:24.142
Ladies pla-- What?

294
00:18:26.567 --> 00:18:29.543
Bathroom. restroom . toilet?

295
00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.746
I mean it's not up to me.

296
00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:36.082
Please. Just one minute I...

297
00:18:36.107 --> 00:18:37.262

301
00:18:45.174 --> 00:18:46.846
Okay? Be really quick.

302
00:18:46.871 --> 00:18:48.072
Really quick.

303
00:18:50.328 --> 00:18:51.328
Spasibo.

304
00:18:52.754 --> 00:18:54.553
Just quick. Hurry back please.

305
00:19:12.567 --> 00:19:15.449
No. it's okay.
Everything's good.
It's fine. Yeah

306
00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:26.221
It's just they have guns.

307
00:19:27.043 --> 00:19:28.793
They have guns...

308
00:19:29.254 --> 00:19:30.496
[gunshot]

309
00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:33.605
Was that a gunshot?

310
00:19:34.655 --> 00:19:35.283
No!

311
00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:37.736
First Stoli. now Natasha!

312
00:19:38.354 --> 00:19:39.831
No. we don't know they shot Natasha.

313
00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:42.245
[gasping]
[shushing]

314
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.862
[whispering]
It's me. it's just me. Okay?

315
00:19:45.541 --> 00:19:46.549
Who else would they cap?

316
00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:49.229
The last thing I did
was call her a bitch

317
00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:51.081
and say I hope there
is a murderer out there.

318
00:19:51.658 --> 00:19:52.910
We have to get out of here.

319
00:19:54.899 --> 00:19:55.564
Let's go!

320
00:19:58.042 --> 00:19:59.212
We're only a floor up.

321
00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:11.948
Rip this into strips.

322
00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:31.186
You need to stay here!

323
00:20:46.367 --> 00:20:47.950
You are going without me?

324
00:20:47.975 --> 00:20:51.077
Oh. Natasha! We thought you was wacked!

325
00:20:51.343 --> 00:20:52.507
Just as you wanted!

326
00:20:52.532 --> 00:20:54.200
You leave me for dead?

327
00:20:54.365 --> 00:20:55.467
Fine. Go!

328
00:20:55.467 --> 00:20:56.827
Are you kidding?

329
00:20:56.953 --> 00:20:57.654
No.

330
00:20:57.679 --> 00:20:58.732
Okay. Okay.

331
00:20:58.806 --> 00:21:00.921
Stay here with murderers instead of coming with us.

332
00:21:01.859 --> 00:21:02.555
Stay.

333
00:21:03.491 --> 00:21:04.585
Okay coming.

334
00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.430
But I am still
not talking to her.

335
00:21:06.455 --> 00:21:07.211
Let's go.

336
00:21:08.548 --> 00:21:10.079
Natasha. Where are you going?

337
00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.616
I am looking for my purse.

338
00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:13.833
Well it's not there.

339
00:21:13.833 --> 00:21:15.433
It must be here.

340
00:21:15.458 --> 00:21:16.419
It's not there.

341
00:21:16.444 --> 00:21:17.513
But I need it!

342
00:21:17.665 --> 00:21:19.774
You need to get out of here. Come on.

343
00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:21.142
Where is my purse?

344
00:21:22.467 --> 00:21:24.365
No Natasha. I checked the whole room.

345
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.387
Are you sure it's not here?

346
00:21:26.888 --> 00:21:28.973
Yes. It probably got left in Don Carlo's car.

347
00:21:31.867 --> 00:21:34.932
There was a drive by
shooting in Los Angeles tonight.

348
00:21:35.108 --> 00:21:37.484
Two victims found
death inside a limousine.

349
00:21:37.509 --> 00:21:42.042
Investigators say it may or it may
not be a gang related incident.

350
00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:43.067
A dead end!

351
00:21:59.933 --> 00:22:00.816
Maybe not.

352
00:22:03.972 --> 00:22:05.268
I think I saw this girl

353
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.745
and two others arriving at LAX
from the same airplane as Don Carlo.

354
00:22:12.974 --> 00:22:13.920
Go to the airlines.

355
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.646
and find out who
she was sitting with.

356
00:22:19.786 --> 00:22:20.950
Let's go.

357
00:22:23.267 --> 00:22:24.372
Just jump!

358
00:22:24.754 --> 00:22:27.191
Natasha. we both jump on the count of three.

359
00:22:27.434 --> 00:22:28.129
Okay.

360
00:22:29.511 --> 00:22:30.233
One...

361
00:22:32.152 --> 00:22:32.856
Two...

362
00:22:33.918 --> 00:22:35.434
[screaming]

363
00:22:36.301 --> 00:22:37.793
No. no. no...

364
00:22:43.433 --> 00:22:44.488
Hey!

365
00:22:46.667 --> 00:22:47.667
Go go go!

366
00:22:51.734 --> 00:22:53.241
Oh God. he's gonna kill me.

367
00:22:54.617 --> 00:22:56.226
Okay. unless.

368
00:22:57.671 --> 00:22:59.031
[screaming]

369
00:23:10.257 --> 00:23:11.226
Stop!

370
00:23:12.281 --> 00:23:13.531
Why are you not stopping?

371
00:23:14.015 --> 00:23:15.466
We've got to bail. yo!

372
00:23:16.867 --> 00:23:17.731
Stop!

373
00:23:18.632 --> 00:23:20.175
She is really leaving us.

374
00:23:21.608 --> 00:23:22.741
I have to find it.

375
00:23:23.167 --> 00:23:24.679
Your purse is gone. Forget it!

376
00:23:24.704 --> 00:23:27.492
I'm not talking about my old
purse. I'm talking about black card.

377
00:23:27.517 --> 00:23:29.202
I don't remember where I put it.

378
00:23:29.227 --> 00:23:30.858
You lost Jay-Z's black card?

379
00:23:30.883 --> 00:23:33.938
Don Carlo's black card.
And shut up please.

380
00:23:33.963 --> 00:23:35.451
I'm not talking to you!

381
00:23:36.476 --> 00:23:39.329
Anya! Anya come back!

382
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.929
The black card is right here!

383
00:23:48.954 --> 00:23:50.462
Anya must have dropped it.

384
00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:51.478
What?

385
00:23:51.624 --> 00:23:54.609
She's gacked it. jacked it. stold it!

386
00:23:54.961 --> 00:23:56.260
Give me my card!

387
00:23:57.273 --> 00:23:58.562
I cant believe it!

388
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.217
And you were mad at me?

389
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.251
And I'm still mad at you and her
too because she stole my card!

390
00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:04.892
And leave it with you!

391
00:24:07.867 --> 00:24:09.593
She running in cirles?

392
00:24:10.127 --> 00:24:11.369
Where are you going?

393
00:24:11.733 --> 00:24:13.386
My profession wants this card?

394
00:24:13.678 --> 00:24:16.240
Ok. I will give it to him
and he will let me go.

395
00:24:16.265 --> 00:24:17.760
And I will go to my audition.

396
00:24:17.785 --> 00:24:19.623
And you both will go to hell!

397
00:24:20.449 --> 00:24:22.667
You go to hell. join Marilyn Monroe there.

398
00:24:23.316 --> 00:24:24.222
What you say?

399
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.341
You just said that Marylin in hell?

400
00:24:28.334 --> 00:24:30.333
What did you say right now?

401
00:24:30.358 --> 00:24:32.014
Marilyn in the hell?

402
00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:34.272
This is you in the hell!

403
00:25:02.942 --> 00:25:03.989
Where are you going?

404
00:25:04.014 --> 00:25:05.238
Stop it!

405
00:25:05.263 --> 00:25:07.920
I have to go and then never see you again.

406
00:25:08.285 --> 00:25:09.689
Except at the audition.

407
00:25:09.714 --> 00:25:11.113
Where I will crush you.

408
00:25:11.402 --> 00:25:13.402
There is one problem with your plan.

409
00:25:13.457 --> 00:25:15.293
What is the problem with my plan?

410
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:16.589
It is stupid.

411
00:25:17.267 --> 00:25:19.346
Are you calling me stupid. stupid?

412
00:25:19.624 --> 00:25:23.110
You go back and give him that card
and he will wack you Natasha.

413
00:25:23.135 --> 00:25:24.220
- Stop it!
- She's right.

414
00:25:24.245 --> 00:25:25.495
[screaming]

415
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.723
Okay please. please --

416
00:25:26.748 --> 00:25:28.242
[groans in pain]

417
00:25:28.267 --> 00:25:31.279
They will kill you. Just like you saw him kill my friends in the library.

418
00:25:32.169 --> 00:25:35.129
Well. one was a friend.

419
00:25:35.154 --> 00:25:36.730
one was my cousin.

420
00:25:38.091 --> 00:25:39.863
and the other guy was
just some guy I work with.

421
00:25:42.196 --> 00:25:43.136
Natasha

422
00:25:44.122 --> 00:25:45.450
is a pretty name.

423
00:25:46.083 --> 00:25:47.852
Listen. okay.
[screaming]

424
00:25:49.286 --> 00:25:50.739
I can help you guys get out of here.

425
00:25:51.145 --> 00:25:54.254
If you can help me get to the hospital.

426
00:25:54.684 --> 00:25:56.714
How can you help us get out of here?

427
00:25:59.733 --> 00:26:00.733
I have a car.

428
00:26:05.998 --> 00:26:08.457
Okay. just take that.
Just don't get rolled in.

429
00:26:08.482 --> 00:26:09.279
Anya!

430
00:26:16.933 --> 00:26:19.216
One more month and I would
have had a company car.

431
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.467
Unlock the door.

432
00:26:26.196 --> 00:26:27.828
God. I hate this car.

433
00:26:28.696 --> 00:26:29.891
Oh no. don't touch it!

434
00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:31.578
- Okay I got it.
- Ah.

435
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.848
- Turn the wheel.
- Just keep it going. just...

436
00:26:48.333 --> 00:26:49.333
Ow!

437
00:26:53.533 --> 00:26:55.642
I don't actually know how to drive.

438
00:27:19.362 --> 00:27:21.029
Why did you stop the car?

439
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.287
Who is the stupid one now?

440
00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:24.933
It's still you.

441
00:27:24.967 --> 00:27:25.823
Sorry--

442
00:27:26.096 --> 00:27:27.315
Uhh. Herman.

443
00:27:27.667 --> 00:27:30.135
Sorry. Herman. I didn't mean to smother you.

444
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.152
No. it's okay.

445
00:27:31.777 --> 00:27:32.769
I kind of liked it.

446
00:27:35.233 --> 00:27:36.233
It doesn't start.

447
00:27:36.904 --> 00:27:40.051
If I miss audition it's just because you both can't drive!

448
00:27:40.076 --> 00:27:42.989
You are more worried about your audition
when they are trying to kill us?

449
00:27:43.466 --> 00:27:44.896
You're stupider than Lalya!

450
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.087
Oh God. I can't stand this car.

451
00:27:59.308 --> 00:28:00.308
Anya!

452
00:28:00.533 --> 00:28:01.733
She ran off again!

453
00:28:02.306 --> 00:28:04.010
You can't leave us here!

454
00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:05.642
Looks like she can!

455
00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.046
Ow! You can't leave me here.

456
00:28:23.482 --> 00:28:24.708
Looks like we can.

457
00:28:25.233 --> 00:28:26.233
But im dying.

458
00:28:26.233 --> 00:28:27.433
You are not dying.

459
00:28:27.433 --> 00:28:29.637
Even if I'm not. which I am.

460
00:28:30.646 --> 00:28:33.342
if they catch me here without
you guys. they will kill me.

461
00:28:43.367 --> 00:28:45.437
Oh shit No. not my dress!

462
00:28:46.564 --> 00:28:48.646
Ha. ha! To you I'm
on the safe place

463
00:28:48.671 --> 00:28:50.236
and they will catch you.

464
00:28:52.467 --> 00:28:53.275
How did you--?

465
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.722
Who is the stupid one now?

466
00:28:54.747 --> 00:28:55.487
Him!

467
00:29:01.262 --> 00:29:02.684
[screaming]

468
00:29:03.551 --> 00:29:04.567
No one move!

469
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.267
I said no one move!

470
00:29:13.767 --> 00:29:15.337
Go get the other one. okay?
I've got this one.

471
00:29:15.933 --> 00:29:17.331
Oh. man! What happened to your leg?

472
00:29:17.356 --> 00:29:18.058
Nothing.

473
00:29:18.261 --> 00:29:20.261
Nothing? You have a bone sticking out!

474
00:29:20.286 --> 00:29:22.292
Don't worry about it. okay?
It happens all the time.

475
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.776
Are you just gonna stand there
or are you gonna go get the other one?

476
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.466
I think we can make
it out to that road.

477
00:29:32.491 --> 00:29:33.544
if you help me. okay?

478
00:29:33.569 --> 00:29:34.350
What?

479
00:29:37.104 --> 00:29:39.681
You just pull gun on
me and my ex-friend.

480
00:29:39.706 --> 00:29:41.783
and now you're
asking me for help?

481
00:29:43.201 --> 00:29:43.971
Look.

482
00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:47.705
That guy. he's got asthma.

483
00:29:47.884 --> 00:29:51.205
Alright he won't make it
two feet without wheezing.

484
00:29:51.432 --> 00:29:53.463
Please listen to me. Your ex-

485
00:29:53.721 --> 00:29:55.808
Your friend

00:29:55.833 --> 00:29:57.317
Oh my God. your fat friend.

487
00:29:57.767 --> 00:29:58.692
Ex-friends.

Will outrun him.

489
00:30:01.111 --> 00:30:03.212
Please. please.

490
00:30:04.181 --> 00:30:05.957
Just help me get to a hospital.

491
00:30:05.982 --> 00:30:08.742

get to your audition.

492

Good evening.

497
00:30:59.104 --> 00:31:05.170
Hello little deary! What are you doing
out here at this time at night? And all alone.

498
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:07.917
You are alone. right?

499
00:31:08.473 --> 00:31:09.041
Yes.

500
00:31:09.682 --> 00:31:11.729
Oh perfect!

501
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.458
I mean. why don't
you come on in?

502
00:31:14.638 --> 00:31:16.112
Come in. little deary.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.822
Thank you so much. Thank you.

504
00:31:35.101 --> 00:31:36.381
Did you see that?

505
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:39.000
How sexy wind made me?

506
00:31:39.467 --> 00:31:40.919
I didn't even try.

507
00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.878
Sorry. I must have missed it.

508
00:31:44.156 --> 00:31:46.949
How could you miss
sexy like Marilyn Monroe.

509
00:31:46.974 --> 00:31:47.933
Stop!

510
00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:53.302
Oh. I can not believe you just stopped for this vag bag.

511
00:31:53.415 --> 00:31:55.387
I told you I was with a woman one time

512
00:31:55.412 --> 00:31:58.418
just to see what it was like and
I would never do it again. honey.

513
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.219
Don't you honey me. slut.

514
00:32:02.193 --> 00:32:03.522
Sammy. look at her.

515
00:32:04.131 --> 00:32:05.840
She's obviously in
trouble. looking like

516
00:32:05.865 --> 00:32:07.947
Lindsay Lohan dressed
up like Marilyn Monroe.

517
00:32:08.772 --> 00:32:10.381
after she was found dead.

518
00:32:10.406 --> 00:32:11.506
Dolboeb!

519
00:32:12.661 --> 00:32:13.359
Hey girl.

520
00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:16.162
you should not be out
here dressed like that.

521
00:32:16.364 --> 00:32:17.452
You obviously need help.

522
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.840
We need help.

523
00:32:18.865 --> 00:32:19.793
He's cute.

Cute?

525
00:32:21.979 --> 00:32:25.027
Look at his leg. OMG!

526
00:32:25.455 --> 00:32:27.940
Oh my God. his bone's pointing at me.

527
00:32:28.333 --> 00:32:31.293
Oh. you would like his bone to point
at you. now wouldn't you Sammy?

528
00:32:31.575 --> 00:32:32.908

529
00:32:32.933 --> 00:32:35.114
- No. no. no.
- Yes.

530
00:32:35.139 --> 00:32:37.436
I am not getting that
on my upholstery.

531
00:32:37.467 --> 00:32:40.628
Stevie. Stevie... we have to help them!

532
00:32:40.653 --> 00:32:42.741

- No way.

533
00:32:42.766 --> 00:32:45.335
- Go back.
- And you think he's cute.

534
00:32:46.167 --> 00:32:47.868

We sacrifice!
[in unison]

00:32:49.973 --> 00:32:54.182
By the strength of Acaat!

537
00:32:54.207 --> 00:32:56.058
A cat? What cat?

538
00:32:56.168 --> 00:33:00.301
To honor Hunab Ku!

539
00:33:01.433 --> 00:33:05.253
We Sacrifice!

540
00:33:05.386 --> 00:33:07.675
Sacrifice? No! Why?

541
00:33:07.863 --> 00:33:10.137
Would someone gag her?

542
00:33:10.162 --> 00:33:11.159
Please!

543
00:33:11.184 --> 00:33:13.770
Why would you sacrifice me? I haven't done anything.

544
00:33:14.167 --> 00:33:17.151
It's not about what
you've done deary.

545
00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:21.652
its about what the
Mayan gods will do.

546
00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:23.747
We were going out

547
00:33:23.887 --> 00:33:27.419
to find a sacrifice to protect ourselves

548
00:33:27.544 --> 00:33:32.770
from the devastation and the
disasters predicted by the Mayan calendar

549
00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:35.242
that ended in 2012.

550
00:33:35.267 --> 00:33:37.808
But 2012 came and there was no disaster.

551
00:33:37.833 --> 00:33:41.051
Do not interrupt me!!

552
00:33:41.533 --> 00:33:42.620
Besides

553
00:33:43.334 --> 00:33:47.413
if 2012 came and
went as you say.

554
00:33:47.631 --> 00:33:50.278
why would the gods deliver

555
00:33:50.303 --> 00:33:56.093
a perfect sacrifice
to our door step?

556
00:33:57.167 --> 00:33:59.788
Oh deary don't worry.

557
00:33:59.813 --> 00:34:03.881
It's just a little blood
letting and decapitation.

558
00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:09.547
That man needs our help!

559
00:34:10.067 --> 00:34:11.067
And you think he's cute?

560
00:34:11.067 --> 00:34:12.457
Yeah he's cute!

561
00:34:14.246 --> 00:34:17.361
You have the audacity to get on to me
about the one time I was with a woman

562
00:34:17.386 --> 00:34:18.964
and then tell me you
think another man is cute?

563
00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.567
No. no way.

564
00:34:20.592 --> 00:34:22.011
I'm definitely not going back!

565
00:34:22.036 --> 00:34:24.000
Go back now.

566
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:32.377
Speed it up.

567
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.165
By the strength of a cat!

568
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.736
What? What?

569
00:34:43.933 --> 00:34:44.628
Sammy?

570
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.876
OMG

571
00:34:49.728 --> 00:34:51.416
That tire is fucked!

572
00:34:51.517 --> 00:34:54.243
Maybe I can blow some air back into it.

573
00:34:55.821 --> 00:34:56.735
Fuck!

574
00:34:58.595 --> 00:34:59.486
Generic's.

575
00:35:02.242 --> 00:35:03.102
Sammy!

576
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:08.522
Maybe someone can help us in there.

577
00:35:09.067 --> 00:35:10.609
In that creepy old house?

578
00:35:12.285 --> 00:35:13.266
I have an idea.

579
00:35:13.324 --> 00:35:16.293
You go over there and see
if anybody can help us.

580
00:35:16.318 --> 00:35:18.831
and I'm gonna try to blow
some air back into that tire.

581
00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:28.091
S...S...Stevie...

582
00:35:34.997 --> 00:35:36.442
By the strength of Acaat.

583
00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:37.864
To honor Hunab Ku.

584
00:35:37.889 --> 00:35:39.275
Hunab Ku!

585
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.753
Oh I don't know. I kinda like it with this
whole antebellum architectural flare.

586
00:35:42.778 --> 00:35:46.151
Oh get off it Stevie. this house is
neo-eclective and you know it.

587
00:35:46.872 --> 00:35:48.309
[doorbell rings]

588
00:35:48.981 --> 00:35:50.426

Cellulite.

591
00:35:57.204 --> 00:36:00.348
Would somneone get the door?

592
00:36:01.442 --> 00:36:02.692
[door knocking]

593
00:36:02.833 --> 00:36:04.161
Hello.

594
00:36:05.106 --> 00:36:08.567
See Stevie. this is karma because you
didn't help that cute guy on the road.

595
00:36:08.592 --> 00:36:10.699
Could you tell me again just how cute he is?

596
00:36:11.942 --> 00:36:13.334
I'm gonna call the police.

597
00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:17.925
And he was real cute.

598
00:36:18.074 --> 00:36:19.668
Slut.

599
00:36:21.629 --> 00:36:23.318
He must have thought
you were cute too.

600
00:36:23.343 --> 00:36:25.646
with the way he was popping
that nasty little boner at you.

601
00:36:29.667 --> 00:36:32.803
Oh this is my kind of party. Hey!

602
00:36:34.171 --> 00:36:35.358
I'm right here Sammie!

603
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.503
Nine-one-one. what's the nature of your emergency?

604

Help!

605
00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.867
This is not my kind of party!

606
00:36:47.867 --> 00:36:49.773
What kind of kinky stuff is this?

607
00:36:49.798 --> 00:36:51.597
This is your fault. Stevie!

608
00:36:51.622 --> 00:36:54.176
This isn't just karma.

609
00:36:54.201 --> 00:36:56.091
Do something! They're going to kill us!

610

I want my mommy!

611
00:36:58.932 --> 00:37:01.067
I wish my daddy loved me!

612

[screaming]

613
00:37:04.288 --> 00:37:05.990

Are you serious right now. holmes?

Baby bye bye bye. Bye bye!

00:37:40.157 --> 00:37:41.407
That was awesome!

621
00:37:41.432 --> 00:37:44.375
I can't believe that fool thought we were gangsters.

622
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.345
Jesus! That pinata line--brilliant!

623
00:37:47.571 --> 00:37:48.540

Why don't you back up man.

625
00:37:52.762 --> 00:37:53.567
Are you okay?

626
00:37:55.331 --> 00:37:59.034
I'm Jesus. this is Jesse. Jorge. and Carlos.

627
00:37:59.675 --> 00:38:01.511
- I'm Jesse.

628
00:38:01.536 --> 00:38:02.590
I mean. I'm Jorge.

629
00:38:03.122 --> 00:38:04.622
Really. you don't know your name?

630
00:38:05.442 --> 00:38:07.112
We're the next big boy-band:

The Front Road Fellas!

634
00:38:15.214 --> 00:38:16.815
Nah. nah that's too derivative.

635
00:38:17.073 --> 00:38:20.221
We should be called
For Her Ears Only.

636
00:38:20.246 --> 00:38:21.706
What do y'all think? Cool?

637
00:38:21.731 --> 00:38:22.439
Hell no.

638
00:38:22.464 --> 00:38:24.573
But that's gonna discount our male friends.

639
00:38:24.598 --> 00:38:26.332
We're still working on the name. you know?

640
00:38:28.285 --> 00:38:29.600
Bubble gum. boys?

641
00:38:31.704 --> 00:38:33.191

- Yeah. you're right.

649
00:38:45.716 --> 00:38:46.637
Idiot.

662
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:40.985
What are you doing in here?

663
00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:44.189
This is a private
residence. officers.

664
00:39:45.233 --> 00:39:47.300
Did we just bust in on an orgy?

665
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.971
This is going to be one of those
privacy of your own home cases.

666
00:39:51.104 --> 00:39:53.270
No. The broken
down car in front.

668
00:39:56.059 --> 00:39:57.471
We had reasonable cause. right?

669
00:39:57.854 --> 00:39:59.182
I don't know.

670
00:39:59.635 --> 00:40:03.178
but I'm not gonna stand in
front a judge on that one again.

671
00:40:03.203 --> 00:40:04.299
You've got that one right.

672
00:40:05.452 --> 00:40:08.599
Ma'am we're sorry to interrupt.
You have a lovely. lovely home.

00:40:13.055 --> 00:40:15.062
Oh. just to make sure.

consenting adult. right?

677
00:40:17.719 --> 00:40:19.461
Oh. certainly. yes.

678
00:40:20.055 --> 00:40:20.860
Good. okay.

679
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.375
We are not consenting; they're going to sacrifice us!

680
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.165
Shut up!

681
00:40:26.767 --> 00:40:27.657

officers.

684
00:40:32.667 --> 00:40:36.079
Separation of church and state.

685
00:40:36.673 --> 00:40:38.492
Does that include human sacrifices?

686
00:40:38.573 --> 00:40:40.265
She's confusing me.

687
00:40:40.434 --> 00:40:42.068
I don't know.

688
00:40:42.093 --> 00:40:43.086
I don't either.

689
00:40:43.859 --> 00:40:45.936
Wish we'd paid more
attention in training.

690
00:40:45.961 --> 00:40:46.968
You got that right.

691
00:40:46.993 --> 00:40:48.142
If you like.

692
00:40:48.167 --> 00:40:51.595
I can show you
our 501[k] paperwork

693
00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:55.776
to prove we're all in
legitimate. non-profit status.

694
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.501
What you think?

695
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:09.314
I don't know. You know my answer.

696
00:41:09.907 --> 00:41:11.936
Okay. okay. Okay great.

697
00:41:12.414 --> 00:41:13.588
That's all we need.

698
00:41:14.867 --> 00:41:16.867
Sorry to interrupt your religious act.

699
00:41:17.102 --> 00:41:18.196

700
00:41:18.221 --> 00:41:20.024
[mumbling through gags]

701
00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:21.321
Have a good night.

702
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.426

704
00:41:31.233 --> 00:41:34.037
Oh!! What now!!

705
00:41:36.865 --> 00:41:39.381
Its just us again. Sorry to interrupt.

706
00:41:39.833 --> 00:41:43.756
But its our protocol to take someone
back to our captain back to the station.

707
00:41:44.248 --> 00:41:45.950
If its not too much
trouble of course.

708
00:41:45.975 --> 00:41:48.041
Why don't you give
me this one. right here.

709
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.654
and keep the other
two for your religious act.

710
00:41:53.833 --> 00:41:54.748
Fine!

711
00:42:12.576 --> 00:42:13.781

You are not dying ok?

714
00:42:33.731 --> 00:42:34.794
You're not dying.

715
00:42:34.819 --> 00:42:36.177
I've lost a lot of blood.

716
00:42:37.247 --> 00:42:39.901
- I can't feel my face.
- No. you can feel your face.

717
00:42:39.935 --> 00:42:42.840
You cant feel your face. You are not dying.

718
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.082
He's dead.

719
00:42:52.755 --> 00:42:53.582
Sorry.

720
00:43:03.153 --> 00:43:04.387
You promised me.

721

And you will take me to my audition!

722

723
00:43:15.567 --> 00:43:17.574
You promise me.

724
00:43:20.527 --> 00:43:21.902
You lied to me.

725
00:43:22.401 --> 00:43:24.965
You promise me.

726
00:43:25.168 --> 00:43:27.698
I have audition to go.

727
00:43:42.334 --> 00:43:45.472
Now that card could have this whole
country bankrupt in a month.

728
00:43:46.201 --> 00:43:48.630
and you lost the only lead to retrieving it!

729
00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:49.475
Are you kidding me?

730
00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:50.451
No!

731
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.044
Right.

732
00:43:53.818 --> 00:43:56.763
A Russian girl. with no I.D..

733
00:43:57.443 --> 00:43:59.380

Come on now.

735
00:44:00.982 --> 00:44:05.013
We've got APBs out for her and

Would you do something about him?

739
00:44:20.067 --> 00:44:21.067
He's a hand full.

740
00:44:21.583 --> 00:44:22.733
You want another partner?

741
00:44:23.012 --> 00:44:24.849
Great! Fantastic!

742
00:44:26.161 --> 00:44:30.410
Sir! A Russian girl claiming
to be Natasha Zaitseva--

743
00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:32.154
I don't know how
to say her last name.

744
00:44:32.179 --> 00:44:36.702
But she dropped the dead body off of a
Herman Muehler at Cedars-Sinai.

745
00:44:38.905 --> 00:44:41.100
She's leaving a trail of dead bodies.

746
00:44:41.125 --> 00:44:43.484
What is this girl. a preying mantis or what?

747
00:44:43.533 --> 00:44:47.146

I'll have your
fricking badge.

753
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.718
You let her go!

754
00:45:20.515 --> 00:45:23.210
Don't you stop anybody from
bringing in dead bodies?

755
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.593
In an accidental death?

756
00:45:24.718 --> 00:45:25.718
Accidental?

757
00:45:25.898 --> 00:45:26.921
Accidental?

758
00:45:27.022 --> 00:45:28.038
Accidental?

759
00:45:29.585 --> 00:45:30.343
Come here!

760
00:45:32.358 --> 00:45:35.030
He's has a femur
sticking out of his leg!

761
00:45:35.131 --> 00:45:36.561
That's not accidental!

762
00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:37.780
Actually. that's not a femur.

763
00:45:38.117 --> 00:45:39.053
[shushes]

764
00:45:39.443 --> 00:45:41.912

00:45:53.178 --> 00:45:54.450
Now get out of here!

772
00:45:58.559 --> 00:45:59.980
Why didn't you say anything? [to nurse]

773
00:46:00.133 --> 00:46:01.720
Um. I've been trying to.

774
00:46:01.832 --> 00:46:04.346
She was hysterical
out of her mind.

775
00:46:04.371 --> 00:46:06.550
They tranqued her and
sent her to the mental ward.

776
00:46:06.956 --> 00:46:08.173
Mental ward?

777
00:46:08.878 --> 00:46:09.886
Crazy people?

778
00:46:10.965 --> 00:46:11.965

where the crazy people are.

781
00:46:16.896 --> 00:46:18.480
Maybe we'll find room for you.

782
00:46:20.386 --> 00:46:22.160
Working with you. I'll shoot in my head cheff.

783

Take a deep breath.

789
00:46:51.478 --> 00:46:52.288
Silly me.

790
00:46:52.629 --> 00:46:55.699
You do this so many times in a
day and you get ahead of yourself.

791
00:46:57.364 --> 00:47:00.558
Now take a deep breath.

792
00:47:03.533 --> 00:47:04.533

Get away from me. Paxton!

808
00:48:12.006 --> 00:48:13.912
Did you save your pills for me?

809
00:48:15.467 --> 00:48:18.349
Under the tongue? In your cheeks?

810
00:48:18.883 --> 00:48:21.476
Oh come on! People pay good
money for those pills.

811

This is what I'm
talking about Alex!

865

880
00:52:45.133 --> 00:52:47.062

882
00:52:51.408 --> 00:52:53.198

I'm already famous.

903
00:54:36.956 --> 00:54:38.066
I can't believe it.

904
00:54:45.587 --> 00:54:47.284
Excuse me. It's not me.

905
00:54:47.449 --> 00:54:48.034
Yeah.

906
00:54:48.893 --> 00:54:51.282
This is probably some mistake.

907
00:54:52.237 --> 00:54:54.379
Put your phone down.
Put your phone down.

908
00:54:54.404 --> 00:54:56.268
It's not me. I said it's not me.

909
00:55:19.939 --> 00:55:21.567
Your feet are so small.

910
00:55:27.367 --> 00:55:30.736
Natasha Za-- [stammering]

911
00:55:30.761 --> 00:55:32.078
How do you pronounce
your last name?

912
00:55:32.633 --> 00:55:33.492
Zaitseva.

913
00:55:38.328 --> 00:55:39.257
Search her.

914
00:55:43.033 --> 00:55:44.747
Guys. this is stupid.

915
00:55:45.337 --> 00:55:49.290
You put your masks on in the
bar. We all saw your faces.

916
00:55:49.798 --> 00:55:53.015
You announced your names
after you sang karaoke.

917
00:55:53.852 --> 00:55:56.219
Jesse. Jesus. Jorge.

918
00:55:56.253 --> 00:55:57.344
- George.
- I'm Jesus!

919
00:55:57.369 --> 00:55:58.497
Whatever

920
00:55:58.813 --> 00:56:00.790
Ok. ok. ok...

921
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.067
I got something.

922
00:57:01.001 --> 00:57:03.110
The card! Yes!

923
00:57:06.766 --> 00:57:07.430
What?

924
00:57:08.126 --> 00:57:09.617
What are you doing? Ow!

925
00:57:10.923 --> 00:57:14.313
[singing]

926
01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:10.738
Hey Georgy.

927
01:01:12.272 --> 01:01:13.132
you forgot your bag.

928
01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:21.655
We're the bubblegum boys.

929
01:01:22.264 --> 01:01:23.944
We're still working on a name. you know.

930
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.889
Can I get another pint?

931
01:01:30.084 --> 01:01:32.279
You must have got something from them.

932
01:01:32.506 --> 01:01:33.114
Nothing!

933
01:01:33.779 --> 01:01:36.575
They were just here at the wrong time at the wrong place.

934
01:01:36.654 --> 01:01:37.735
They were pawns!

935
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.350
Naive girls. here
for some audition.

936
01:01:40.967 --> 01:01:42.529
'Beautiful Russia Girl Number One'.

937
01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:43.787
What?

938
01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.849
'Beautiful Russia Girl Number One'.

939
01:01:46.842 --> 01:01:48.037
[knocking]

940
01:01:49.293 --> 01:01:52.144
Sir. you told me to report as soon as
I finished the analytics on the card.

941
01:01:52.598 --> 01:01:53.598
Yeah?

942
01:01:54.613 --> 01:01:56.222
Well. I finished the analytics on the card.

943
01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:57.700
Yeah. and?

944
01:01:58.168 --> 01:02:01.769
Well. first of all. I've never seen
anything like it. it's brilliant!

945
01:02:02.035 --> 01:02:05.111
Whenever you buy something with it--and you
can buy anything you want. there's no limit-

946
01:02:05.136 --> 01:02:08.716
-it draws funds directly from the U.S.
Treasury at an exponentially growing rate.

947
01:02:08.716 --> 01:02:08.723
-it draws funds directly from the U.S.
Treasury at an exponentially growing rate.
but it does so using
an evolving algorithm.

948
01:02:08.723 --> 01:02:10.403
but it does so using
an evolving algorithm.

949
01:02:10.428 --> 01:02:14.193
so two dollars could become two thousand
dollars or even two hundred thousand dollars.

950
01:02:15.169 --> 01:02:17.848
and then it routes that money through
a series. a web of bank accounts.

951
01:02:17.873 --> 01:02:19.859
These are average. innocent
citizens' bank accounts. you know.

952
01:02:19.859 --> 01:02:19.873
These are average. innocent
citizens' bank accounts. you know.
from lower and middle class people all the
way up to millionaires and billionaires--

953
01:02:19.873 --> 01:02:21.895
from lower and middle class people all the
way up to millionaires and billionaires--

954
01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.483
withdrawing money here.
depositing money there--

955
01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:27.954
A the end of the day. somebody could wake up and find they've
moved up from the lowerclass to the upper class overnight.

956
01:02:27.979 --> 01:02:29.806
or a millionaire could
discover he's broke!

957
01:02:29.831 --> 01:02:32.454
But in the end. huge
pools of U.S. money from

958
01:02:32.479 --> 01:02:36.087
each transaction on the card ends up in a completely
disguised bank account. or accounts plural.

959
01:02:36.822 --> 01:02:41.059
The only chance of finding them is spending money on the
card. inputting the original algorithm from the card.

960
01:02:41.084 --> 01:02:43.307
and monitoring the U.S. Treasury
and banks throughout the nation.

961
01:02:43.332 --> 01:02:47.042
knowing the variables of what was
spent of course. visible account activity. etcetera.

962
01:02:47.067 --> 01:02:49.710
and try to solve for the unknown
variables. but that's risky;

963
01:02:50.457 --> 01:02:54.121
this card could bankrupt the
whole country in like a week.

964
01:02:57.267 --> 01:03:00.200
Did either of you just understand what he just said?

965
01:03:00.993 --> 01:03:02.657
Did he even breathe during all that?

966
01:03:02.759 --> 01:03:06.396
Basically. whenever you use the card.
it steals money from the Treasury.

967
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.646
scrambles the money through bank
accounts throughout the country.

968
01:03:09.671 --> 01:03:11.536
and drops it in an
untraceable account.

969
01:03:11.993 --> 01:03:14.743
Now with the card. we have a chance
of discovering where the money goes.

970
01:03:15.064 --> 01:03:17.150
but risk bankrupting the
whole country in a week.

971
01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.473
That's essentially right.

972
01:03:18.482 --> 01:03:21.255
Ah you know what? There is
a tracking device in the card

973
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.727
that I may or may not have
triggered when scanning it

974
01:03:23.752 --> 01:03:27.817
So using the card would most likely
draw out the account. or accounts plural.

975
01:03:27.842 --> 01:03:29.903
holder in an attempt
to retrieve the card.

976
01:03:29.928 --> 01:03:31.901
But. I mean. that's
also a risky plan. it's like.

977
01:03:31.926 --> 01:03:34.255
a trillion dollars could
just vanish like that!

978
01:03:34.613 --> 01:03:37.621
Oh my God. this card is brilliant.

979
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.611
So we use our newly acquired
pawns to draw out our criminal.

980
01:03:52.809 --> 01:03:53.692
So uhh...

981
01:03:54.059 --> 01:03:55.270
Give the girls back the card.

982
01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.200
Sir. I don't think that's a--

983
01:03:57.225 --> 01:03:59.075
Shut up. Edwards! You chatter too much.

984
01:04:00.184 --> 01:04:00.887
Alright.

985
01:04:17.233 --> 01:04:18.233
Anya!

986
01:04:18.615 --> 01:04:19.590
Natasha.

987
01:04:36.033 --> 01:04:37.154
I thought you two were friends.

988
01:04:39.986 --> 01:04:43.160
You'll have to pretend that you're
friends because you have a new job.

989
01:04:45.872 --> 01:04:47.236
working for the FBI.

990
01:04:47.767 --> 01:04:48.618
A job?

991
01:04:49.165 --> 01:04:51.142
Yes. A job is--

992
01:04:51.167 --> 01:04:52.758
I know what job means.

993
01:04:52.901 --> 01:04:54.368
Really? Then why did you ask?

994
01:04:56.033 --> 01:04:57.073
What kind of job?

995
01:04:57.916 --> 01:04:59.416
Going on a shopping spree.

996
01:05:08.015 --> 01:05:09.100
For safe keeping.

997
01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.723
Beauty salon please.

998
01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.014
Most expensive one.

999
01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:10.867
For two dresses?

1000
01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:13.687
These two can bankrupt the whole country in a week!

1001
01:06:15.397 --> 01:06:16.913
This was a bad idea.

1002
01:06:18.529 --> 01:06:19.490
Lets go!

1003
01:06:22.435 --> 01:06:24.769
Jorge's cousin just took
over Estudios Mexicana.

1004
01:06:24.794 --> 01:06:27.606
They're looking for actors
to turn into big stars.

1005
01:06:27.974 --> 01:06:30.645
Especially those who know
how to sing and dance.

1006
01:06:30.958 --> 01:06:34.349
So we've been casing that bar for
months to get the money to go down there.

1007
01:06:34.756 --> 01:06:37.738
With that voice. you done
become an overnight success.

1008
01:06:38.106 --> 01:06:39.428
You gotta come with us.

1009
01:06:39.845 --> 01:06:42.201
I'm supposed to go to audition tonight.

1010
01:06:42.396 --> 01:06:43.832
We're not really asking.

1011
01:06:44.826 --> 01:06:46.248
You have to come with us.

1012
01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.790
Oh...

1013
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.087
Well. I don't go to
audition anyway.

1014
01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.353
Why not?

1015
01:06:53.095 --> 01:06:56.126
Because I do not like what
it does to my friendships.

1016
01:06:57.982 --> 01:07:01.242
But I don't want to
go Mexico alone.

1017
01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:01.962
Alone?

1018
01:07:02.771 --> 01:07:04.574
Everything's about connections.

1019
01:07:04.599 --> 01:07:07.192
Forget this town.
everything's bottled up.

1020
01:07:07.771 --> 01:07:11.482
We got the connections that will
make you a world famous singer in Mexico.

1021
01:07:12.067 --> 01:07:14.591
Come on lets just go!
You know you want to roll!

1022
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.985
OK.

1023
01:07:19.981 --> 01:07:20.746
I'm in.

1024
01:07:21.777 --> 01:07:24.867
But I have one request....

1025
01:07:28.267 --> 01:07:30.467
Girlfriend. you're with us now!

1026
01:07:40.767 --> 01:07:44.017
Do you think all girls here pretend
to be 'Beautiful Russia Girl Number One'?

1027
01:07:46.602 --> 01:07:48.306
Let's narrow down the competition.

1028
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:52.109
Excuse me where the bar is?

1029
01:07:52.367 --> 01:07:53.946
I think is over there.

1030
01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:55.320
Thank you.

1031
01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.338
Okay.

1032
01:08:08.363 --> 01:08:11.152
You're our last two for tonight so let's get this going.

1033
01:08:22.972 --> 01:08:24.097
What are you doing?

1034
01:08:25.714 --> 01:08:27.120
This how Americans say hello.

1035
01:08:31.855 --> 01:08:32.831
Stop it.

1036
01:08:34.007 --> 01:08:35.355
Where are ya'll from?

1037
01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:36.655
Russia.

1038
01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.400
Really?

1039
01:08:46.695 --> 01:08:48.642
- Where is she going?
- I don't know.

1040
01:09:14.967 --> 01:09:16.654
Actually. I am from Russia too.

1041
01:09:16.818 --> 01:09:19.474
Of course you are.
I love the accent.

1042
01:09:19.599 --> 01:09:20.780
How long you been in L.A.?

1043
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:22.388
We came for this audition.

1044
01:09:22.974 --> 01:09:24.434
Wait wait wait..

1045
01:09:25.748 --> 01:09:27.877
You came all the way from Russia

1046
01:09:28.864 --> 01:09:30.201
for this audition?

1047
01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:34.325
Actually. I would like to audition
for 'Beautiful Russia Girl #2'.

1048
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:41.185
[clapping]

1049
01:09:41.967 --> 01:09:43.115
We've done seen enough.

1050
01:09:43.365 --> 01:09:45.756
You got the looks.
you got the voice.

1051
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.927
They want us.

1052
01:09:50.544 --> 01:09:51.958
They want us!

1053
01:09:55.771 --> 01:09:58.504
That'll be nine hundred fifty dollars
and you're both in the film.

1054
01:09:59.801 --> 01:10:01.513
We pay you?

1055
01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:05.088
Yeah. this is the way things
work in Hollywood nowadays.

1056
01:10:05.113 --> 01:10:06.919
It's called crowd funding.

1057
01:10:07.234 --> 01:10:09.093
It's investing in yourself.

1058
01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:10.390
[laughs]

1059
01:10:11.651 --> 01:10:13.304
You also get a producer's credit.

1060
01:10:14.148 --> 01:10:15.639
It's a scam.

1061
01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.684
No. no. no. It's not a scam.

1062
01:10:17.965 --> 01:10:21.401
We've had the most success we've
had today. than any other day.

1063
01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:23.762
I know. It's like every girl who came in here was drunk.

1064
01:10:23.787 --> 01:10:24.660
Yeah.

1065
01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:27.918
Bottom line. we don't need
you to make this movie.

1066
01:10:28.426 --> 01:10:32.167
But if you want to be a part.
nine hundred fifty dollars.

1067
01:10:33.233 --> 01:10:34.989
It is scam!

1068
01:10:36.701 --> 01:10:38.963
Fine. We're done for the night.

1069
01:10:39.049 --> 01:10:40.686
Thank you for your time.

1070
01:10:41.998 --> 01:10:43.272
Wait. wait please.

1071
01:10:43.896 --> 01:10:46.200
Oh. you're in?

1072
01:10:46.404 --> 01:10:48.106
Oh. wow. There we go. Let's get that.

1073
01:10:48.131 --> 01:10:49.029
Thank you.

1074
01:10:49.167 --> 01:10:52.067
Alright. well that will be
950 dollars each.

1075
01:10:52.092 --> 01:10:53.238
Comes to 1900 total.

1076
01:10:53.263 --> 01:10:57.419
Russian woman one and two
or Russian woman one and one?

1077
01:10:58.178 --> 01:10:59.569
One and two.

1078
01:11:01.499 --> 01:11:02.420
There you go.

1079
01:11:02.672 --> 01:11:05.631
Alright ladies . welcome to Hollywood!

1080
01:11:06.373 --> 01:11:09.217
[gunshots]
[screaming]

1081
01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:13.826
I believe that card belongs to me.

1082
01:11:17.348 --> 01:11:19.654
Scam. scam. scam!

1083
01:11:19.679 --> 01:11:24.264
[screaming]

1084
01:11:27.913 --> 01:11:30.124
[gunshots]

1085
01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:34.179
[gunshot]
[screaming]

1086
01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:37.945
- FBI!
- Freeze!

1087
01:11:41.429 --> 01:11:42.437
No pulse.

1088
01:11:43.077 --> 01:11:44.874
- Stand down.
- All clear.

1089
01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:57.759
Ladies. You done good.

1090
01:11:58.928 --> 01:12:00.453
Your English is not so good.

1091
01:12:00.853 --> 01:12:02.162
You didn't do that good.

1092
01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.170
Natasha.

1093
01:12:14.529 --> 01:12:16.909
How does it feel to have a dream?

1094
01:12:16.934 --> 01:12:17.962
I didn't have a dream.

1095
01:12:17.987 --> 01:12:19.708
It was all scam.

1096
01:12:19.957 --> 01:12:21.410
But you didn't know that at first.

1097
01:12:21.435 --> 01:12:23.285
Yeah. for a moment. you
were cast in a movie

1098
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:26.200
after going on a shopping
spree on Rodeo Drive.

1099
01:12:26.457 --> 01:12:28.472
Yes. How did that feel?

1100
01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:30.941
It felt good.

1101
01:12:31.993 --> 01:12:34.327
But it wasn't worth losing Lalya over.

1102
01:12:35.446 --> 01:12:39.368
Well I don't know about Lalya.
but at least you didn't lose Anya.

1103
01:12:42.665 --> 01:12:43.608
Yeah. you're right.

1104
01:12:43.633 --> 01:12:45.055
Friendship can make it through a lot

1105
01:12:46.211 --> 01:12:48.460
Get your hands off my head!

1106
01:12:48.485 --> 01:12:49.500
What do you think
this is?

1107
01:12:49.525 --> 01:12:54.922
A bank meltdown today had people all over the U.S.
seeing fluctuations in their bank account balances.

1108
01:12:54.947 --> 01:12:59.460
It is estimated that it will cost the nation
just over a trillion dollars in bailouts.

1109
01:12:59.765 --> 01:13:04.017
Many worry the government's Chinese
creditors will call the U.S. on its debt.

1110
01:13:04.567 --> 01:13:06.205
A trillion dollars?

1111
01:13:06.728 --> 01:13:08.556
Do you think this is gonna come down on us?

1112
01:13:09.119 --> 01:13:09.805
Come on!

1113
01:13:14.259 --> 01:13:16.000
Are you friends with Lalya Saratova?

1114
01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:17.675
Uh. yes?

1115
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:18.700
Come with me.

1116
01:13:19.735 --> 01:13:23.368
Anya! He found Lalya! Lets go!

1117
01:13:35.907 --> 01:13:40.308
[screaming]

1118
01:14:11.566 --> 01:14:13.198
What's up. bitches?

1119
01:14:13.394 --> 01:14:15.167
[screams]

1120
01:14:15.604 --> 01:14:16.503
Lalya!

1121
01:14:31.504 --> 01:14:32.528
Hey.

1122
01:14:38.535 --> 01:14:39.400
See you around.

1123
01:14:57.074 --> 01:14:59.000
So. where are we?

1124
01:14:59.601 --> 01:15:00.801
Me-me-me-Mexico.

1125
01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.473
That's good girl.

1126
01:15:03.151 --> 01:15:06.417
I had enough of this Hollywood and United States.

1127
01:15:06.613 --> 01:15:08.995
I think we helped to make
it a province of China anyway.

1128
01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.314
Where we going?

1129
01:15:12.534 --> 01:15:13.780
Estudios Mexicano.

1130
01:15:13.805 --> 01:15:15.401
I have so much to tell you.

1131
01:15:15.557 --> 01:15:17.221
It is off the hook.

1132
01:15:17.424 --> 01:15:18.213
Woo!

1133
01:15:18.752 --> 01:15:20.112
Do you know how to drive now?

1134
01:15:20.733 --> 01:15:21.955
I learned.

1135
01:15:31.869 --> 01:15:32.838
Sorry.
