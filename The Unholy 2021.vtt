00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:30.324
You know. I wouldn't even
get out of bed for less than 6k

16
00:02:30.498 --> 00:02:32.630
when I worked for the Examiner. Yeah. Well. Gerry.

17
00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:35.067
you should try
getting your old job back.

18
00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:37.679
You know what. Max? I don't
wanna talk to you anymore.

19
00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:39.071
so send me the details.

20
00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:40.595
I'm gonna run home
and grab some crap.

21
00:02:52.694 --> 00:02:55.784
I don't know a lot about cows.
but doesn't look mutilated.

22
00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.003
Yeah? Check her
behind there.

23
00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.354
Right there.

24
00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:02.573
Might be the work of
some of those Satanists

25
00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:04.358
I keep hearing about.
you know. the--

26
00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:06.534
They put on these animal masks.
strip down.

27
00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:08.405
and they engage
in unholy orgies.

28
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.844
Mr. Geary.
may I ask you a question?

29
00:03:13.018 --> 00:03:14.890
Yeah. sure.Do you have a son?

30
00:03:15.064 --> 00:03:16.674
Yeah.

31
00:03:16.848 --> 00:03:18.850
Sixteen?No. he's 15.

32
00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:22.463
You ever hear
of the band Metallica?

33
00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:29.252
Sorry. I. uh...

34
00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.127
Could have fooled me.

35
00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:37.217
HAGAN: Geary?Oh. jeez. here we go.

36
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.349
Yeah?

37
00:03:39.523 --> 00:03:41.525
This is church property.

38
00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.179
Get that cow out of here.

39
00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:45.094
I'm-- I'm wicked sorry.
Father Hagan.

40
00:03:45.268 --> 00:03:47.096
Uh. it won't happen again.
I swear to God.

41
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.141
You said that last week.

42
00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:51.840
This cow craps everywhere.

43
00:03:52.014 --> 00:03:54.234
I know. It's a mess. Sorry.

44
00:03:54.408 --> 00:03:56.410
Now. Geary.GEARY: You got it.

45
00:03:59.456 --> 00:04:00.718
I own the farm next door.

46
00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:02.851
I've been meaning
to mend that fence.

47
00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:04.853
You know what.
I-- I don't care.

48
00:04:05.027 --> 00:04:08.422
What I do care about
is my employer is not gonna pay

49
00:04:08.596 --> 00:04:10.337
for pictures
of that cow's ass.

50
00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:15.037
I-- I don't know what to say.Yeah. I know you don't.

51
00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:29.921
Did you hear that?

52
00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:31.314
Hear what?

53
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:33.882
Mr. Fenn?

54
00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.536
What the hell?

55
00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:43.125
"February 31. 1845."

56
00:05:56.181 --> 00:05:58.009
Yeah. farmers used
to plant 'em in the fields.

57
00:05:58.183 --> 00:05:59.837
uh. for good luck.

58
00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:02.536
Man. never seen one
like that. though.

59
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.624
GERRY:
God. that is creepy.

60
00:06:10.457 --> 00:06:13.242
"When the ancient talisman
was broken.

61
00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:16.463
mysterious cattle mutilations
began."

62
00:06:16.637 --> 00:06:18.856
This ain't broken.

63
00:06:21.511 --> 00:06:22.730
You-- You broke it.

64
00:06:22.904 --> 00:06:24.906
Let's not argue
about who broke what.

65
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.386
You just got done
telling me my son--

66
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.952
Or who mutilated what.

67
00:06:28.126 --> 00:06:30.346
Now we have a story.

68
00:06:33.088 --> 00:06:35.003
Come on. help me out. man.With what?

69
00:06:35.177 --> 00:06:37.875
We'll get a big picture of
that lovable mug in the article.

70
00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:39.747
Oh. no. I don't want a picture.Yeah. yeah.

71
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:41.531
Come on.
Get down there by the thing.

72
00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:43.751
Like I found it?Yeah.

73
00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:45.230
All right.

74
00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.058
Yeah. that's good.

75
00:06:48.756 --> 00:06:50.497
GEARY: You like it?Better than a cow's ass.

76
00:06:50.671 --> 00:06:51.411
GEARY:
All right.

77
00:06:55.893 --> 00:06:58.505
GERRY:
Ah. where does a fella get
something to eat around here?

78
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.210
GERRY:
This is a cool place.

79
00:07:08.384 --> 00:07:10.299
Is it always this busy?

80
00:07:10.473 --> 00:07:12.083
This?

81
00:07:12.257 --> 00:07:13.998
This is rush hour.

82
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.661
And an unidentified vandal
broke a protective talisman.

83
00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:28.796
An unholy evil was released.

84
00:07:30.362 --> 00:07:32.974
An evil thirsty for blood.

85
00:07:33.148 --> 00:07:34.715
It began...

86
00:07:37.326 --> 00:07:40.285
It began by sucking
on a cow's ass.

87
00:07:42.766 --> 00:07:44.725
Good God. Fenn.

88
00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:48.293
You were gonna win a Pulitzer.

89
00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:50.600
Idiot.

90
00:07:53.298 --> 00:07:54.909
Oh. shit.

91
00:08:11.142 --> 00:08:13.362
Oh. shit.

92
00:08:24.808 --> 00:08:25.722
Shit.

93
00:08:27.158 --> 00:08:28.290
Hey!

94
00:08:53.315 --> 00:08:54.577
Hey.

95
00:09:41.102 --> 00:09:45.323
ALICE:
I pledge my soul to you.
I pledge my soul to you.

96
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:50.459
I promise. I will.

97
00:09:53.244 --> 00:09:55.333
I will.

98
00:09:55.507 --> 00:09:57.945
Hey. are you okay?

99
00:09:58.119 --> 00:09:59.729
Thank you.

100
00:10:14.788 --> 00:10:16.093
HAGAN:
I'm coming.

101
00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:24.101
Alice.

102
00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:32.196
HAGAN:
Yeah. Dr. Gates.
it's an emergency.

103
00:10:35.678 --> 00:10:37.680
Please. As soon as you can.

104
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.775
NATALIE:
How are you feeling?

105
00:10:52.608 --> 00:10:54.828
HAGAN:
This has never happened before.
Could--?

106
00:10:55.002 --> 00:10:56.786
Could she
have been sleepwalking?

107
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.051
She seems fine. I can check in
again tomorrow after Mass.

108
00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:02.618
Hmm?

109
00:11:08.189 --> 00:11:12.672
So Alice. she lives
with Father Hagan?

110
00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:16.893
He's her uncle. He's raised her
since her parents died.

111
00:11:17.067 --> 00:11:19.374
That's-- The thing is...

112
00:11:22.246 --> 00:11:24.640
It's not possible. Alice has
never spoken a word in her life.

113
00:11:24.814 --> 00:11:25.902
She has
congenital cholesteatoma.

114
00:11:26.076 --> 00:11:27.817
Look. I get it.
You don't know me.

115
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:29.384
and I made
a bad first impression.

116
00:11:32.387 --> 00:11:35.259
Okay. What's your
blood alcohol level?

117
00:11:35.433 --> 00:11:37.871
You are lucky
that Alice is okay.

118
00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:40.134
If anything
had happened to her.

119
00:11:40.308 --> 00:11:42.049
I would have made it
my own personal mission

120
00:11:42.223 --> 00:11:43.659
to see you locked up.

121
00:11:45.052 --> 00:11:47.402
Get in.

122
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:01.851
This. uh.
the best place you got?

123
00:12:02.025 --> 00:12:03.810
This is the only place
we've got.

124
00:12:07.465 --> 00:12:09.685
Okay.

125
00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:12.470
Well. at least it's cheap.

126
00:12:12.644 --> 00:12:14.646
At least it's not jail.

127
00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:05.959
Hey. Gerry.Hey. I'm still in Banfield.

128
00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:08.700
Um. I got into a little bit
of an accident.

129
00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:11.355
so I. uh--
Story gonna be late.

130
00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:14.228
Forget it. Obscura.com ran a
cattle mutilation piece today.

131
00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:20.756
What if I have
another story? Um...

132
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.454
Deaf-mute girl here.
connected to the church.

133
00:13:23.628 --> 00:13:25.500
she spontaneously talked.

134
00:13:25.674 --> 00:13:27.284
Religious angle.

135
00:13:27.458 --> 00:13:29.939
Okay. Gerry.Two hundred bucks.

136
00:13:30.113 --> 00:13:33.377
Pays 150. And bring pictures.

137
00:13:33.551 --> 00:13:36.554
Don't be such a cheap bastard. Mm-hmm.

138
00:13:36.728 --> 00:13:38.818
PARISHIONERS:
...you take away
the sins of the world.

139
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:43.735
Lamb of God. you take away
the sins of the world.

140
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.650
Grant us peace.

141
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.043
Lord. I am not worthy

142
00:13:47.217 --> 00:13:48.784
that you should
enter under my roof.

143
00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.919
but only say the word
and my soul shall be healed.

144
00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:01.623
HAGAN:
Behold the Lamb of God.

145
00:14:01.797 --> 00:14:05.018
Behold him who takes away
the sins of the world.

146
00:14:19.946 --> 00:14:21.643
:
Alice...

147
00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:17.889
The Lady...

148
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.950
The Lady has...

149
00:16:35.124 --> 00:16:37.170
an urgent message for all of us.

150
00:16:42.305 --> 00:16:44.916
She wants us
to come again tomorrow.

151
00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:50.052
She... She says...

152
00:16:53.229 --> 00:16:54.839
She says her name is Mary.

153
00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:08.723
Alice. these tests will allow us
to evaluate your hearing.

154
00:17:08.897 --> 00:17:10.768
Are you ready?

155
00:17:10.942 --> 00:17:13.771
I'm gonna play
a series of sounds for you...

156
00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:15.599
at different volumes.

157
00:17:23.346 --> 00:17:27.002
Now you're gonna
hear some words.

158
00:17:27.176 --> 00:17:30.527
and I'd like you to repeat them
back to me. okay?

159
00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:31.746
RECORDED VOICE:
Cat.

160
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.921
Cat.

161
00:17:34.227 --> 00:17:35.532
Apple.

162
00:17:35.706 --> 00:17:36.490
Apple.

163
00:17:38.144 --> 00:17:39.362
Number five.

164
00:17:39.536 --> 00:17:41.277
Number five.

165
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:42.539
Ocean.

166
00:17:42.713 --> 00:17:44.150
Ocean.

167
00:18:07.869 --> 00:18:11.220
MONICA: Slade here.

168
00:18:11.394 --> 00:18:13.788
Burning the midnight oil.
I see.

169
00:18:13.962 --> 00:18:15.572
I always thought
you worked too hard.

170
00:18:15.746 --> 00:18:16.617
Fenn.

171
00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:19.010
Monica. It's been a while.

172
00:18:19.185 --> 00:18:21.100
Not long enough.

173
00:18:21.274 --> 00:18:22.579
Listen. I have a story for you.

174
00:18:22.753 --> 00:18:25.539
Uh. something I think
the Examinerwill love.

175
00:18:25.713 --> 00:18:30.239
An occurrence.
A healing. possibly divine.

176
00:18:30.413 --> 00:18:32.546
I swear. it's the truth.

177
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.983
You were never interested
in the truth.

178
00:18:35.157 --> 00:18:36.985
For you. it was all about fame.

179
00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:39.422
All right. look. I totally
get the skepticism. But--

180
00:18:39.596 --> 00:18:42.556
You still don't get it. do you?
You lied.

181
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.862
You were caught
fabricating stories.

182
00:18:45.036 --> 00:18:47.038
You almost ruined
this paper's reputation.

183
00:18:47.213 --> 00:18:49.345
People lost their jobs
because of you.

184
00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:51.391
Next time you feel
the urge to call me. don't.

185
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.397
Fuck.

186
00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:01.025
You think Mary
will cure me. Dad?

187
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.375
Let's pray to her.

188
00:20:09.338 --> 00:20:10.252
Friends.

189
00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:12.515
Please. Please.

190
00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:14.300
Uh...

191
00:20:14.474 --> 00:20:18.042
I've asked Alice to stay inside.

192
00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:20.349
I'm-- Obviously.
we're very happy

193
00:20:20.523 --> 00:20:22.830
and grateful
that she's recovered.

194
00:20:23.004 --> 00:20:26.312
but I think this is all
a bit overwhelming for her.

195
00:20:28.357 --> 00:20:29.793
So nothing is
gonna happen today.

196
00:20:32.709 --> 00:20:34.233
If you could
all please go home.

197
00:20:34.407 --> 00:20:36.322
I'd appreciate it.

198
00:20:36.496 --> 00:20:38.237
Thank you.MAN: Look. there she is.

199
00:20:38.411 --> 00:20:40.326
Alice.

200
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.116
HAGAN:
Alice.

201
00:21:30.637 --> 00:21:32.160
Thank you.

202
00:21:46.566 --> 00:21:47.697
Do you believe in miracles?

203
00:21:52.267 --> 00:21:54.443
Do you have faith in Mary?

204
00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:56.924
Yes.

205
00:21:58.708 --> 00:21:59.666
Then walk.

206
00:22:01.189 --> 00:22:02.103
I can't.

207
00:22:04.192 --> 00:22:06.629
Mary commands you to walk.

208
00:22:08.588 --> 00:22:09.763
But I can't.

209
00:22:13.897 --> 00:22:14.724
ALICE:
Believe.

210
00:23:11.085 --> 00:23:13.000
Hail Mary...

211
00:23:13.174 --> 00:23:15.524
ALL:
Full of Grace.
the Lord is with thee.

212
00:23:15.698 --> 00:23:18.745
Blessed art thou among women.

213
00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:21.182
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb. Jesus.

214
00:23:21.356 --> 00:23:25.012
Holy Mary. mother of God.
pray for us sinners.

215
00:23:25.186 --> 00:23:28.798
now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

216
00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:45.728
NEWSCASTER:
Next up. a strange story
from our local news affiliate.

217
00:23:45.902 --> 00:23:48.862
FEMALE REPORTER:
The town of Banfield
in central Massachusetts.

218
00:23:49.036 --> 00:23:51.038
A paralyzed boy
named Toby Walsh

219
00:23:51.212 --> 00:23:54.215
claims he was healed by
an 18-year-old Alice Pagett.

220
00:23:54.389 --> 00:23:56.435
Images of a miracle
have gone viral.

221
00:23:56.609 --> 00:23:59.394
Bishop James Gyles
of the Boston Archdiocese

222
00:23:59.568 --> 00:24:02.963
has announced a press
conference this morning.

223
00:24:03.137 --> 00:24:07.010
1858. a French girl named
Bernadette Soubirous

224
00:24:07.184 --> 00:24:09.012
claimed to have had
a series of visitations

225
00:24:09.186 --> 00:24:10.971
from the Blessed Virgin
in a grotto

226
00:24:11.145 --> 00:24:13.190
outside the town of Lourdes.

227
00:24:13.364 --> 00:24:16.585
1917. Fátima. Portugal.

228
00:24:16.759 --> 00:24:19.980
Three shepherd children reported
apparitions of the Virgin Mary.

229
00:24:20.154 --> 00:24:22.765
followed by miracles.
prophesies.

230
00:24:25.246 --> 00:24:29.946
1981. Medjugorje. Bosnia.

231
00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.602
Six witnesses observed
a Marian apparition.

232
00:24:33.776 --> 00:24:35.952
Many claim that
the Holy Mother continues

233
00:24:36.126 --> 00:24:39.129
to visit this
shrine to this very day.

234
00:24:40.957 --> 00:24:42.698
The present.

235
00:24:42.872 --> 00:24:47.398
All three shrines draw millions
of faithful each year.

236
00:24:47.573 --> 00:24:50.924
In Lourdes alone.
over 5000 miraculous cures

237
00:24:51.098 --> 00:24:53.361
have been recorded.GERRY: Excuse me.

238
00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:57.191
Are you saying that Banfield
could become such a shrine?

239
00:24:57.365 --> 00:25:01.891
Well. first
we have to. uh. confirm

240
00:25:02.065 --> 00:25:04.633
that an actual miracle
has truly occurred.

241
00:25:04.807 --> 00:25:06.330
And that is why
Monsignor Delgarde here

242
00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:09.029
has been tasked by the Vatican

243
00:25:09.203 --> 00:25:11.466
to investigate
these. uh. alleged healings.

244
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.946
Monsignor.

245
00:25:15.383 --> 00:25:18.995
In the 18th century.
Pope Benedict XIV

246
00:25:19.169 --> 00:25:20.910
laid out a procedure
to determine

247
00:25:21.084 --> 00:25:23.609
the veracity of a miracle.

248
00:25:23.783 --> 00:25:26.133
The main steps are:

249
00:25:26.307 --> 00:25:29.266
the illness must be incurable.

250
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.139
the cure must be instantaneous.

251
00:25:32.313 --> 00:25:34.576
the cure must be complete.

252
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.665
In my capacity as inquisitor.

253
00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:40.103
I intend to use all medical
science and technology available

254
00:25:40.277 --> 00:25:43.585
to disprove the alleged miracle

255
00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:45.369
and expose any deceit.

256
00:25:47.676 --> 00:25:51.375
If I fail. the miracle
is to be considered genuine.

257
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.642
Meanwhile.
the church has installed

258
00:25:56.816 --> 00:25:59.514
a shelter over the site
to protect it from the elements

259
00:25:59.688 --> 00:26:01.603
and. uh. public intrusion.

260
00:26:04.301 --> 00:26:05.999
Yes. Yes. yes. Go ahead.

261
00:26:06.173 --> 00:26:09.089
When will we see
Alice Pagett and Toby Walsh?

262
00:26:09.263 --> 00:26:12.571
Well. the Walsh family has asked
for privacy at this time.

263
00:26:12.745 --> 00:26:14.834
and we intend
to respect their wishes.

264
00:26:15.008 --> 00:26:17.619
Uh. Miss Pagett. however.
has. uh. offered

265
00:26:17.793 --> 00:26:19.621
to speak with you
on her own accord.

266
00:26:19.795 --> 00:26:21.492
Alice. you don't have to go--

267
00:26:24.713 --> 00:26:26.889
You don't have to go in there
if you don't want to.

268
00:26:27.063 --> 00:26:29.065
It's okay. Dr. Gates.

269
00:26:29.239 --> 00:26:30.676
This is what the Lady wants.

270
00:26:38.553 --> 00:26:40.990
The lady you claim appeared
to you. is she the Virgin Mary?

271
00:26:41.164 --> 00:26:44.037
REPORTER 1:
And what exactly were her words?

272
00:26:44.211 --> 00:26:46.735
Do you have a history
of any mental illness?

273
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:50.347
REPORTER 2:
Have you received any financial
incentives to make these claims?

274
00:26:53.307 --> 00:26:54.656
What does the lady look like?

275
00:26:57.485 --> 00:27:00.488
She's dressed
in flowing white robes.

276
00:27:00.662 --> 00:27:05.536
She glows like how the sun
shimmers on a hazy day.

277
00:27:05.711 --> 00:27:08.714
And how does she--
How does she speak to you?

278
00:27:08.888 --> 00:27:10.803
Is it a voice in your head?

279
00:27:10.977 --> 00:27:13.936
Alice. have you ever
used drugs before?

280
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.635
When did--?
When did you first see her?

281
00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:19.594
Five nights ago. in the field.

282
00:27:19.768 --> 00:27:21.596
You were there.

283
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.946
And what does Mary want?

284
00:27:26.383 --> 00:27:27.689
Our faith.

285
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:34.522
I'm. uh-- I'm told
we'll have some privacy in here.

286
00:27:34.696 --> 00:27:35.697
Please.

287
00:27:37.612 --> 00:27:39.179
A little surprised
that. ahem.

288
00:27:39.353 --> 00:27:41.268
Father Hagan missed
the press conference.

289
00:27:41.442 --> 00:27:43.705
Uh. yes. well. uh.

290
00:27:43.879 --> 00:27:47.491
Father Hagan is unfortunately
not feeling well.

291
00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:50.103
I am sorry to hear that.
I imagine he is pretty excited

292
00:27:50.277 --> 00:27:52.409
about his church
becoming a shrine.

293
00:27:52.583 --> 00:27:54.063
Yet to be determined.

294
00:27:55.717 --> 00:27:58.459
Alice is speaking
perfectly.

295
00:27:58.633 --> 00:28:00.983
though she has never heard
any form of speech before.

296
00:28:01.157 --> 00:28:03.464
How do you explain that?There are various degrees

297
00:28:03.638 --> 00:28:05.292
of deafness. Mr. Fenn.

298
00:28:05.466 --> 00:28:07.773
Alice may have been
unconsciously hearing all along.

299
00:28:07.947 --> 00:28:09.818
Come on.Are you Catholic?

300
00:28:09.992 --> 00:28:12.255
I was raised Catholic.
Lapsed.

301
00:28:12.429 --> 00:28:14.431
Spiritually and professionally.
it would appear.

302
00:28:14.605 --> 00:28:17.478
My lack of faith
could be an advantage.

303
00:28:17.652 --> 00:28:19.610
Having
a neutral observer along

304
00:28:19.785 --> 00:28:23.049
to record the process
would be healthy.

305
00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:25.965
Now. you may find
someone more devout. but--

306
00:28:26.139 --> 00:28:28.402
But they'd be
accused of bias. Yeah.

307
00:28:28.576 --> 00:28:29.882
Give me the exclusive.

308
00:28:31.405 --> 00:28:33.059
Only I talk to Alice.

309
00:28:33.233 --> 00:28:35.844
I promise you
I will be fair.

310
00:28:36.018 --> 00:28:37.411
And if. for whatever reason.

311
00:28:37.585 --> 00:28:39.979
any of these miracles
turn to be false.

312
00:28:40.153 --> 00:28:42.285
then I personally
will take the hit.

313
00:28:42.459 --> 00:28:46.072
Alice certainly seems
more inclined to talk to you.

314
00:28:46.246 --> 00:28:48.596
Your Grace.
this man's reputation is--

315
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.772
Yes. yes. I know. Vincent.

316
00:28:52.643 --> 00:28:54.863
Everyone deserves
a second chance. though.

317
00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:57.866
Even Mr. Fenn here.

318
00:31:11.695 --> 00:31:14.785
But they keep screamin'

319
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.615
To filter out somehow

320
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:20.400
Wanna leave...

321
00:31:20.574 --> 00:31:23.229
I asked if I could
join the church choir.

322
00:31:23.403 --> 00:31:26.188
All my life. I've been watching
them sing from the sidelines.

323
00:31:26.362 --> 00:31:28.147
You know the worst part
about being deaf?

324
00:31:31.585 --> 00:31:33.500
I said. you know
the worst part about being deaf?

325
00:31:33.674 --> 00:31:36.807
What's that?You can't listen to music.

326
00:31:36.982 --> 00:31:38.722
But you can feel it.

327
00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:41.638
You turn the volume way up
and play something really loud.

328
00:31:41.812 --> 00:31:46.600
like the "1812 Overture." heh.
you can feel the vibrations.

329
00:31:46.774 --> 00:31:48.297
Well. it's good to know
that you are

330
00:31:48.471 --> 00:31:50.256
just like
every other teenager.

331
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.649
So any new favorites?

332
00:31:52.823 --> 00:31:54.173
I think I might be
into country.

333
00:31:54.347 --> 00:31:57.219
Oh. Alice. keep exploring.

334
00:31:58.873 --> 00:32:00.701
All right. I think
I got this all set up.

335
00:32:00.875 --> 00:32:04.966
Uh. what do you say we do
a couple real easy questions?

336
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.359
How many are gonna watch?

337
00:32:07.969 --> 00:32:09.144
Well. that is--

338
00:32:09.318 --> 00:32:11.712
That is hard to say...

339
00:32:11.886 --> 00:32:13.627
but maybe millions.

340
00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:16.064
Mary wants to reach
as many people as possible.

341
00:32:16.238 --> 00:32:18.980
Well. we wanna
make Mary happy. don't we?

342
00:32:20.242 --> 00:32:21.461
Okay.

343
00:32:23.332 --> 00:32:25.508
There are...

344
00:32:25.682 --> 00:32:29.382
There are people out there that
don't believe in your miracles.

345
00:32:29.556 --> 00:32:31.862
How would you respond
to those folks?

346
00:32:32.037 --> 00:32:34.691
Seeing is believing.

347
00:32:34.865 --> 00:32:37.868
And why do you think
Mary chose you?

348
00:32:38.043 --> 00:32:41.002
Because she gives voice
to the voiceless.

349
00:32:41.176 --> 00:32:44.701
and I've been silent
for a really long time.

350
00:32:44.875 --> 00:32:46.442
I prayed so hard to her.

351
00:32:46.616 --> 00:32:49.010
I yearned to be healed
and she answered.

352
00:32:51.143 --> 00:32:52.927
I opened myself up to Mary

353
00:32:53.101 --> 00:32:54.973
and welcomed her in.

354
00:32:55.147 --> 00:32:56.975
And she heard me. Mr. Fenn.

355
00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:59.716
More than that. she listened.

356
00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:00.717
All my life.

357
00:33:00.891 --> 00:33:02.502
people barely looked at me.

358
00:33:02.676 --> 00:33:04.634
like I was invisible.

359
00:33:04.808 --> 00:33:08.334
But now when I walk into
the room. everybody listens.

360
00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.034
You understand
what that's like.

361
00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:17.212
People used to listen to you.

362
00:33:17.386 --> 00:33:19.998
They used to hang
on your every word.

363
00:33:20.172 --> 00:33:23.653
You had so much power.
but now it's gone.

364
00:33:23.827 --> 00:33:26.439
Wait. wait. Alice. how do you--?Mary told me.

365
00:33:28.876 --> 00:33:32.401
She looked at you in the field
and saw someone who needed her.

366
00:33:32.575 --> 00:33:34.751
A soul yearning for her touch.

367
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.582
You and the Lady want
the same thing. Mr. Fenn.

368
00:33:39.756 --> 00:33:41.280
Spread her word.

369
00:33:43.064 --> 00:33:44.805
Seize this chance.

370
00:33:44.979 --> 00:33:47.199
Spread her word and be rewarded.

371
00:33:47.373 --> 00:33:50.724
HAGAN:
Alice. you have any idea
what I did with my book?

372
00:33:50.898 --> 00:33:52.073
I can't--

373
00:33:57.774 --> 00:34:00.038
Alice. I'd like to have a word

374
00:34:00.212 --> 00:34:01.517
with Mr. Fenn
in private. please.

375
00:34:11.353 --> 00:34:13.529
Uh. Gyles authorized me
to be here.

376
00:34:13.703 --> 00:34:15.618
You just wanna
take advantage of her.

377
00:34:16.967 --> 00:34:18.273
And I won't let--

378
00:34:26.368 --> 00:34:28.762
I won't let you use her.

379
00:34:33.593 --> 00:34:34.811
Emphysema?

380
00:34:36.552 --> 00:34:39.077
My-- My grandmother
had emphysema.

381
00:34:40.643 --> 00:34:42.297
You think that's a good idea?

382
00:34:52.177 --> 00:34:54.266
Father Hagan. your niece.

383
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.181
she is a remarkable young woman.

384
00:34:56.355 --> 00:34:58.705
She has a gift.

385
00:34:58.879 --> 00:35:01.229
Now. imagine...

386
00:35:01.403 --> 00:35:03.405
Imagine what the people
would think

387
00:35:03.579 --> 00:35:06.756
if they were able to actually
see God's work in action?

388
00:35:08.367 --> 00:35:11.326
Don't talk to me about God.

389
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.981
You'd sell your soul
for a story. and you know it.

390
00:35:14.155 --> 00:35:16.244
I-- I guess I don't understand

391
00:35:16.418 --> 00:35:18.116
what is wrong
with doing some good

392
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.118
and maybe a few people
profiting from it.

393
00:35:20.292 --> 00:35:23.686
Like you and your church.
Everybody wins.

394
00:35:25.297 --> 00:35:27.864
Everybody.

395
00:35:28.038 --> 00:35:31.303
The bishop thinks a shrine
would be wonderful for Banfield.

396
00:35:32.913 --> 00:35:34.654
Maybe.

397
00:35:34.828 --> 00:35:37.047
I'm not sure it would
be wonderful for Alice.

398
00:35:40.268 --> 00:35:42.270
When God builds a church.

399
00:35:42.444 --> 00:35:44.620
the devil builds
a chapel next door.

400
00:35:48.494 --> 00:35:50.191
I never thought
that I would hear

401
00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:52.280
a Catholic priest
quote Martin Luther.

402
00:35:54.369 --> 00:35:56.850
Mr. Fenn...

403
00:35:57.024 --> 00:36:00.854
we are in an eternal battle
between good and evil.

404
00:36:01.028 --> 00:36:04.727
Wherever God goes.
the unholy follows.

405
00:36:04.901 --> 00:36:08.470
The girl who saw
the Virgin Mary at Lourdes...

406
00:36:08.644 --> 00:36:11.038
the world
treated her like a freak.

407
00:36:11.212 --> 00:36:15.695
She lived out the rest of her
life locked away in a convent.

408
00:36:15.869 --> 00:36:18.828
In Fátima. three children
saw the Virgin Mary.

409
00:36:19.002 --> 00:36:21.527
Two of them were dead
by the end of the year.

410
00:36:25.008 --> 00:36:27.750
Miracles. Mr. Fenn.

411
00:36:28.925 --> 00:36:30.405
Miracles.

412
00:36:32.364 --> 00:36:34.931
They're strong acts of faith.

413
00:36:35.105 --> 00:36:38.152
and there is nothing
that Satan likes more

414
00:36:38.326 --> 00:36:40.589
than to corrupt our faith.

415
00:37:11.707 --> 00:37:14.057
:
Well. our town was founded
in the early 19th century

416
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:15.798
by Catholic farmers.

417
00:37:15.972 --> 00:37:17.844
The earliest mention
in our records is found

418
00:37:18.018 --> 00:37:20.455
in the county assessor's
almanac of 1852.

419
00:37:20.629 --> 00:37:22.762
He refers to it as Banefield.

420
00:37:22.936 --> 00:37:25.025
a place of strange
and terrible wonders.

421
00:37:25.199 --> 00:37:27.157
:
Wonders? What does that mean?

422
00:37:27.332 --> 00:37:29.247
LIBRARIAN:
Well. it could've
been anything.

423
00:37:29.421 --> 00:37:31.466
A two-headed calf.
a black goat.

424
00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.122
Back then. people saw
the devil behind every tree.

425
00:38:11.767 --> 00:38:14.857
GERRY:
"There are various degrees
of deafness.

426
00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:18.296
Alice may have unconsciously
been hearing all along."

427
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:19.514
Those are your words.

428
00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:25.215
I entered a seminary
when I was 19.

429
00:38:26.565 --> 00:38:28.523
The Jesuits.

430
00:38:28.697 --> 00:38:32.701
While still a novice.
I disproved a case of stigmata.

431
00:38:32.875 --> 00:38:36.966
Caught the attention
of the Holy See.

432
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:41.971
I have read several libraries'
worth on the supernatural.

433
00:38:42.145 --> 00:38:46.367
investigated half a dozen
cases of alleged miracles.

434
00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:48.151
Proved them all false.

435
00:38:50.066 --> 00:38:53.505
Oh. you know damn well
I didn't cook this up.

436
00:38:53.679 --> 00:38:56.464
It wouldn't be the first time.

437
00:38:56.638 --> 00:38:59.162
You know.
there's this part in the Bible

438
00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:03.906
about forgiving sins.
kind of a major plot point.

439
00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:08.346
If the sinner confesses
his sins and truly repents.

440
00:39:13.525 --> 00:39:14.569
Anything you care to tell me?

441
00:39:15.962 --> 00:39:16.919
No.

442
00:39:28.975 --> 00:39:30.280
That was very good. Alice.

443
00:39:30.455 --> 00:39:33.371
That was-- That was excellent.

444
00:39:33.545 --> 00:39:36.112
Next. we should try "Mary--"

445
00:39:36.286 --> 00:39:37.897
"Mary of--"

446
00:39:39.551 --> 00:39:40.726
"Promi--"

447
00:39:48.603 --> 00:39:49.778
Oh!

448
00:39:49.952 --> 00:39:51.476
Ouch!

449
00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:00.572
Do you have faith in her?I...

450
00:40:00.746 --> 00:40:02.574
Do you pledge to serve her

451
00:40:02.748 --> 00:40:04.358
with all your heart and soul?Yes.

452
00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:09.450
Yeah. I need an ambulance
at Church of Our Lady.

453
00:40:09.624 --> 00:40:10.669
Father Hagan collapsed.

454
00:40:31.037 --> 00:40:32.517
Oh.

455
00:40:37.478 --> 00:40:38.697
I can breathe.

456
00:40:42.048 --> 00:40:43.745
I can breathe.

457
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.057
Alice. I can breathe.

458
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:06.986
NATALIE:
Father Hagan's
most recent physical.

459
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.510
You'll see the mass
in the left lower lung field.

460
00:41:09.684 --> 00:41:12.731
causing complete collapse
in the lower left lobe.

461
00:41:12.905 --> 00:41:14.689
They gave him six months tops.

462
00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:19.302
Father Hagan's lungs today.

463
00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:21.522
GERRY:Wait...

464
00:41:21.696 --> 00:41:23.306
are you saying
that he's healed?

465
00:41:25.178 --> 00:41:27.006
Apparently so.

466
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.052
What about the kid. Toby Walsh?
Are results in for him?

467
00:41:30.226 --> 00:41:32.054
Boston Children's Hospital
diagnosed him

468
00:41:32.228 --> 00:41:34.187
as suffering
from muscular dystrophy.

469
00:41:34.361 --> 00:41:35.188
No cure.

470
00:41:35.362 --> 00:41:38.234
While impossible...

471
00:41:38.408 --> 00:41:41.150
Toby's afflictions
have completely disappeared.

472
00:41:44.676 --> 00:41:46.678
All right. let me make sure
I got this straight.

473
00:41:46.852 --> 00:41:48.462
that I'm not missing something.

474
00:41:48.636 --> 00:41:49.985
There are
three main requirements

475
00:41:50.159 --> 00:41:51.987
to be considered a miracle.

476
00:41:52.161 --> 00:41:54.424
The illness must be incurable.

477
00:41:54.599 --> 00:41:57.079
the cure must be instantaneous

478
00:41:57.253 --> 00:41:59.865
and the cure must be complete.

479
00:42:00.039 --> 00:42:01.257
Correct?

480
00:42:03.999 --> 00:42:05.131
Oh. come on.

481
00:42:07.046 --> 00:42:09.135
This is the real deal.
This is genuine.

482
00:42:11.616 --> 00:42:13.922
It certainly
appears that way. Mr. Fenn.

483
00:42:14.096 --> 00:42:17.796
NEWSCASTER:
The main requirements for a
genuine miracle have been met.

484
00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.928
The Pope has decreed
that the field

485
00:42:20.102 --> 00:42:22.714
where the Virgin Mary appeared
is a holy shrine.

486
00:42:22.888 --> 00:42:24.454
GERRY:
What does Alice mean to you?

487
00:42:24.629 --> 00:42:27.109
Alice is my hero.

488
00:42:27.283 --> 00:42:29.895
I felt invisible.
just like she did.

489
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:31.940
But now. seeing
what she's become.

490
00:42:32.114 --> 00:42:35.335
she inspires me. She's holy. You can tell.

491
00:42:35.509 --> 00:42:37.685
She's gonna be bigger
than Taylor Swift. I know it.

492
00:42:37.859 --> 00:42:39.034
Nothing ever happens
in Banfield.

493
00:42:39.208 --> 00:42:41.646
No. This-- This is huge. right?

494
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.256
GERRY: Where you going? Anywhere but here.

495
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:44.562
GERRY:
Aren't you happy
about the miracles?

496
00:42:44.736 --> 00:42:46.302
No. sir. I am not.

497
00:42:46.476 --> 00:42:50.524
I like when God stays
where he belongs.

498
00:42:50.698 --> 00:42:54.397
Up there. When he comes
down here. bad things happen.

499
00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:57.052
Floods. plagues of locusts.

500
00:42:57.226 --> 00:43:00.273
The Old Testament God
is wrathful.

501
00:43:00.447 --> 00:43:02.710
What if something
pisses him off?

502
00:43:02.884 --> 00:43:06.975
The impact to the economy of
Banfield cannot be overstated.

503
00:43:07.149 --> 00:43:09.282
In Europe. the shrines
at Lourdes and Fátima

504
00:43:09.456 --> 00:43:11.850
each attract
6 million tourists a year.

505
00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.209
Monica. I'm a little surprised
to be hearing from you.

506
00:43:23.383 --> 00:43:25.777
Yeah. well. I talked
it over with management.

507
00:43:25.951 --> 00:43:28.257
We decided ten years
was long enough.

508
00:43:28.431 --> 00:43:29.824
You paid your dues.

509
00:43:31.739 --> 00:43:34.046
Well. as tempting
as that sounds. I pass.

510
00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.614
What? I want a desk. Monica.

511
00:43:36.788 --> 00:43:39.138
Special Sections...

512
00:43:40.748 --> 00:43:42.750
You're out of your bloody mind.

513
00:43:42.924 --> 00:43:45.797
I'm fielding calls
from Chicago. New York. D.C.

514
00:43:45.971 --> 00:43:48.669
Every major Catholic demographic
on this planet

515
00:43:48.843 --> 00:43:50.845
is eating this up.

516
00:43:51.019 --> 00:43:53.152
I have exclusive access
to Alice Pagett.

517
00:43:53.326 --> 00:43:55.502
You wanna talk to Alice.
you have to go through me.

518
00:43:55.676 --> 00:43:57.417
No story without Alice.

519
00:43:57.591 --> 00:44:01.073
which means no story
without Gerry Fenn.

520
00:44:04.206 --> 00:44:06.687
I'll get back to you. I'm sure you will.

521
00:44:17.698 --> 00:44:19.482
Who's back?

522
00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:21.093
That guy's back.

523
00:44:22.747 --> 00:44:24.531
I'm gonna need new headshots!

524
00:44:29.362 --> 00:44:31.103
This is my home.

525
00:44:31.277 --> 00:44:33.235
I've never lived
anywhere else.

526
00:44:35.368 --> 00:44:37.892
But my uncle felt I'd be
better off at the diocese.

527
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:41.983
I'm sorry. Alice.
It sucks.

528
00:44:42.157 --> 00:44:43.245
I get it.

529
00:44:44.899 --> 00:44:46.901
Where is your uncle.
anyway?

530
00:44:47.075 --> 00:44:50.078
He has some work
at the church.

531
00:44:50.252 --> 00:44:53.255
I just don't know
what he's gonna do without me.

532
00:44:53.429 --> 00:44:55.736
Like. who's gonna catch him
if he tries to smoke?

533
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.523
I don't know for certain.
but I think he'll be okay.

534
00:45:00.698 --> 00:45:01.742
He's a big boy.

535
00:45:03.657 --> 00:45:08.053
Hey... think of it as
a new adventure you're going on.

536
00:45:08.227 --> 00:45:11.752
And in honor of that.
I made you something.

537
00:45:14.624 --> 00:45:15.974
A mix.

538
00:45:16.148 --> 00:45:19.499
Now. please remember
that I'm an old dude.

539
00:45:19.673 --> 00:45:22.067
so you're gonna have
to put up with some classics.

540
00:45:22.241 --> 00:45:24.460
The Beatles.
Zeppelin. The Stones.

541
00:45:24.634 --> 00:45:26.245
Eagles. some Tupac.

542
00:45:26.419 --> 00:45:27.899
But I also tried
to figure out

543
00:45:28.073 --> 00:45:29.509
what the kids
listen to these days.

544
00:45:29.683 --> 00:45:30.945
So you get
some Billie Eilish.

545
00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:32.773
Rufus Wainwright.
Smashing Pumpkins.

546
00:45:34.906 --> 00:45:36.821
It's just really important
that you know

547
00:45:36.995 --> 00:45:40.389
that there is a whole big world
out there besides. uh. country.

548
00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:42.957
Thanks.

549
00:45:46.004 --> 00:45:48.310
You know. you're not as big
a jerk as everybody thinks.

550
00:45:50.617 --> 00:45:51.661
Okay. Thank you.

551
00:45:57.319 --> 00:46:00.801
The Lady is happy
with you. Mr. Fenn.

552
00:46:00.975 --> 00:46:02.760
All these people praying to her.

553
00:46:02.934 --> 00:46:05.501
believing in her
because of you.

554
00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:11.943
Well. you tell the Lady
she's welcome.

555
00:47:51.172 --> 00:47:53.566
WAITRESS:
From the lady.

556
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.959
The lady?

557
00:48:01.922 --> 00:48:03.619
Different lady.

558
00:48:06.318 --> 00:48:08.842
Why'd you do it?What?

559
00:48:09.016 --> 00:48:10.670
Why'd you fabricate
all those stories?

560
00:48:14.543 --> 00:48:16.284
The truth?Yeah.

561
00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:18.983
Fame.

562
00:48:23.683 --> 00:48:25.206
When you are on top of the world

563
00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.991
and those lights are on you...

564
00:48:28.427 --> 00:48:29.602
it is...

565
00:48:31.125 --> 00:48:32.605
It's like a drug.

566
00:48:32.779 --> 00:48:34.041
and it's intoxicating.

567
00:48:34.215 --> 00:48:36.783
And I got caught up in it...

568
00:48:38.219 --> 00:48:40.569
and I thought
I was untouchable.

569
00:48:40.743 --> 00:48:42.354
Pride before the fall.

570
00:48:42.528 --> 00:48:45.487
Does everyone
quote the Bible around here?

571
00:48:45.661 --> 00:48:48.577
Banfield's always been
a place of faith.

572
00:48:48.751 --> 00:48:50.231
Faith. yeah.Mm-hmm.

573
00:48:50.405 --> 00:48:52.886
Faith and superstition.

574
00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.496
You know. the first day
I was here.

575
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:57.369
my farmer friend and I.
we found a kern doll.

576
00:48:57.543 --> 00:48:59.937
A kern baby.Baby. yeah.

577
00:49:00.111 --> 00:49:01.503
Fields are full of them.Yeah.

578
00:49:01.677 --> 00:49:04.680
But according to my farmer
friend. not like this one.

579
00:49:04.854 --> 00:49:07.509
This one was
wrapped up in a chain.

580
00:49:07.683 --> 00:49:10.556
and the chain was stamped
with an impossible date.

581
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:12.645
February 31st.

582
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.779
What?

583
00:49:16.954 --> 00:49:19.652
Uh. um...What?

584
00:49:22.307 --> 00:49:25.005
Kern babies
are good luck. right?

585
00:49:25.179 --> 00:49:27.660
Yeah.But they also believe

586
00:49:27.834 --> 00:49:31.011
that you could trap
bad things in them. and so...

587
00:49:33.753 --> 00:49:36.625
You know. they would
wrap it up in a chain

588
00:49:36.799 --> 00:49:40.716
and they would put
an impossible date

589
00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:44.329
on that kern baby.
like February 31st.

590
00:49:44.503 --> 00:49:46.461
And they hoped that

591
00:49:46.635 --> 00:49:49.160
that would just keep
that spirit trapped forever.

592
00:49:54.469 --> 00:49:56.950
So how is Toby Walsh doing?

593
00:49:57.124 --> 00:49:58.821
Actually. he made
the school soccer team.

594
00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:02.521
So it's a real miracle.

595
00:50:02.695 --> 00:50:05.567
Wait a minute. I thought doctors
didn't believe in miracles.

596
00:50:05.741 --> 00:50:07.961
Science and God
are not mutually exclusive.

597
00:50:08.135 --> 00:50:09.615
I could tell you stories.

598
00:50:10.877 --> 00:50:12.052
Fenn?

599
00:50:25.326 --> 00:50:27.850
I've seen this place before.

600
00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:29.287
Pequod Creek?

601
00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.507
We used to come here
Easter Sunday

602
00:50:32.681 --> 00:50:35.119
for the church picnics
until they sold it off.

603
00:50:37.338 --> 00:50:39.340
Wait. this was church property?Yeah.

604
00:50:39.514 --> 00:50:42.996
Church owned most of Banfield
ever since Our Lady was built.

605
00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:45.564
When? When was that?

606
00:50:45.738 --> 00:50:46.913
Mid-1800s.

607
00:50:47.087 --> 00:50:48.610
1845?

608
00:50:50.699 --> 00:50:51.961
How did you know that?

609
00:51:17.422 --> 00:51:18.684
Fenn?

610
00:51:22.209 --> 00:51:23.254
What's wrong?

611
00:51:29.129 --> 00:51:30.565
I need to speak to Hagan.

612
00:51:30.739 --> 00:51:32.045
Something happened here.

613
00:51:32.219 --> 00:51:34.178
Something connected
to the church.

614
00:52:04.643 --> 00:52:06.862
Confession is from 7 to 8.

615
00:52:07.036 --> 00:52:08.821
WOMAN:
Bless me. Father.
for I have sinned.

616
00:52:10.823 --> 00:52:12.041
May the Lord be in your heart

617
00:52:12.216 --> 00:52:14.566
and help you confess your sins.

618
00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.917
It's been. oh. some while
since my last confession.

619
00:52:18.091 --> 00:52:20.311
Uh-huh. Go on.

620
00:52:20.485 --> 00:52:22.574
I've taken
the Lord's name in vain.

621
00:52:22.748 --> 00:52:26.099
been covetous.
had impure thoughts...

622
00:52:26.273 --> 00:52:28.884
destroyed many lives.

623
00:52:29.058 --> 00:52:31.974
led many souls
into perdition...

624
00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:34.716
and now I've come for you.

625
00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:36.675
Say three Hail Marys and--

626
00:52:36.849 --> 00:52:39.721
I healed you.

627
00:52:39.895 --> 00:52:42.898
Instead of faith.
you repaid me with doubt.

628
00:52:43.072 --> 00:52:45.249
And what did it gain you?

629
00:52:45.423 --> 00:52:50.297
You discovered the truth
at the expense of your life.

630
00:52:50.471 --> 00:52:55.346
And do you actually believe
you can stop me?

631
00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.480
Shall I tell you what happened
to those who have tried?

632
00:52:59.654 --> 00:53:04.093
I stripped the flesh
from their bones.

633
00:53:04.268 --> 00:53:06.487
I slit their windpipes

634
00:53:06.661 --> 00:53:09.795
and watched the breath
slowly leak out.

635
00:53:13.581 --> 00:53:15.801
Satan. He gave me the power

636
00:53:15.975 --> 00:53:18.456
to perform miracles.No! No!

637
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:22.590
Pray for your sweet
blessed Mary to save you.

638
00:53:22.764 --> 00:53:24.897
Jesus--Let's see who's stronger.

639
00:53:25.071 --> 00:53:27.639
her or me!

640
00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:08.462
No. please... Aah!

641
00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:39.711
Father Hagan?

642
00:54:53.246 --> 00:54:54.378
Father Hagan?

643
00:55:08.566 --> 00:55:10.089
Father Hagan?

644
00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.469
I don't get it.

645
00:55:42.643 --> 00:55:46.865
Why would Hagan kill himself?
He had just been healed.

646
00:55:47.039 --> 00:55:49.128
Who knows
what demons plagued him?

647
00:55:50.825 --> 00:55:52.131
This will. of course.
be reported

648
00:55:52.305 --> 00:55:55.047
as a tragic accident.

649
00:55:55.221 --> 00:55:56.918
As I'm sure
you can appreciate.

650
00:55:57.092 --> 00:55:59.791
suicide is somewhat frowned
upon in our profession.

651
00:55:59.965 --> 00:56:03.098
So I must ask for
your discretion in this matter.

652
00:56:03.272 --> 00:56:06.014
Father Hagan was
the shepherd of this community.

653
00:56:07.886 --> 00:56:09.670
You can appreciate
the damage it would do

654
00:56:09.844 --> 00:56:11.498
now that Banfield
has been reborn.

655
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.763
Let me ask you something.

656
00:56:17.722 --> 00:56:19.767
When you turn on the news.
what do you see?

657
00:56:19.941 --> 00:56:23.945
War. famine. disease.
suffering. hate.

658
00:56:24.119 --> 00:56:25.469
The devil is winning. Mr. Fenn.

659
00:56:27.122 --> 00:56:29.081
Faith is the only thing

660
00:56:29.255 --> 00:56:32.258
that stands
between us and perdition.

661
00:56:33.433 --> 00:56:35.696
And this place. this shrine.

662
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:38.743
will help
strengthen our faith...

663
00:56:38.917 --> 00:56:40.222
thanks to you.

664
00:56:42.268 --> 00:56:43.878
None of it...

665
00:56:44.052 --> 00:56:46.490
would've been
possible without you.

666
00:57:11.863 --> 00:57:15.214
My uncle loved me
and cared for me.

667
00:57:15.388 --> 00:57:17.477
He was the only family I had.

668
00:57:23.657 --> 00:57:25.398
You know what. this is...

669
00:57:25.572 --> 00:57:28.706
This is dumb. We can do
this some other time. Um...

670
00:57:30.229 --> 00:57:31.360
No. uh...

671
00:57:32.666 --> 00:57:34.189
Mary relieved his suffering

672
00:57:34.363 --> 00:57:37.932
before calling him
to his eternal reward.

673
00:57:38.106 --> 00:57:40.195
She wants us
to continue her work.

674
00:57:47.681 --> 00:57:48.856
Okay.

675
00:57:54.209 --> 00:57:55.341
You know...

676
00:57:57.169 --> 00:57:58.997
your uncle believed

677
00:57:59.171 --> 00:58:03.305
that wherever God went.
the devil was close behind.

678
00:58:05.133 --> 00:58:06.744
Do you think that--?

679
00:58:09.442 --> 00:58:12.445
Do you think there could be
other forces at play here?

680
00:58:12.619 --> 00:58:14.621
Mary would
never let that happen.

681
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:20.714
Don't doubt her. Mr. Fenn.

682
00:58:22.324 --> 00:58:24.065
She is the Blessed Virgin.

683
00:58:24.239 --> 00:58:25.414
The mother of God.

684
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:27.373
Her love for us
is so deep it burns.

685
00:58:27.547 --> 00:58:28.766
She--

686
00:58:33.422 --> 00:58:35.555
Mary is speaking
to me right now.

687
00:58:39.211 --> 00:58:43.171
She says. "Doubt weakens faith.

688
00:58:46.044 --> 00:58:48.655
Doubt leads to damnation."

689
01:00:03.077 --> 01:00:06.559
Blurry vision. wobbly knees.

690
01:00:06.733 --> 01:00:09.954
No doctor could find
what was wrong with me.

691
01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:12.739
But one look at Alice.
and I was cured.

692
01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.525
Shut up.

693
01:00:19.311 --> 01:00:23.054
She is the Blessed Virgin.
The mother of God.

694
01:00:23.228 --> 01:00:26.100
Her love for us
is so deep it burns. She--

695
01:00:42.856 --> 01:00:44.771
It burns. She--

696
01:01:10.188 --> 01:01:11.929
:
I will save you.

697
01:01:17.499 --> 01:01:19.545
Doubt leads to damnation.

698
01:01:20.938 --> 01:01:22.374
Natalie.

699
01:01:22.548 --> 01:01:24.202
Hey.

700
01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:25.899
I don't understand.

701
01:01:26.073 --> 01:01:27.727
Father Hagan wouldn't
have done this.

702
01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:30.338
I don't think he did.

703
01:01:30.512 --> 01:01:33.298
Do you know where
the church records are kept?

704
01:01:33.472 --> 01:01:35.604
Yeah. it's-- It's in the back.

705
01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:38.172
I need to see the files.

706
01:01:38.346 --> 01:01:41.610
Uh. the funeral's
about to start.

707
01:01:44.048 --> 01:01:44.918
All right.

708
01:02:04.677 --> 01:02:07.114
We gather here today...

709
01:02:07.288 --> 01:02:10.378
to pay our respects
to Father William Hagan.

710
01:02:40.887 --> 01:02:44.761
Do you have any idea what
we're looking for down here?

711
01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:47.938
Anything related to 1845.

712
01:02:52.246 --> 01:02:55.728
Behold. I will tell you
a mystery.

713
01:02:55.902 --> 01:02:58.165
We shall not all fall asleep...

714
01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.474
but we will be changed
in an instant.

715
01:03:20.622 --> 01:03:22.015
Natalie...

716
01:03:23.277 --> 01:03:24.670
look at this.

717
01:03:27.281 --> 01:03:29.675
Uh. in Latin.

718
01:03:31.111 --> 01:03:33.113
Oh. God. okay.

719
01:03:33.287 --> 01:03:35.376
Med school
had a Latin requirement.

720
01:03:37.378 --> 01:03:38.771
Testamentum...

721
01:03:38.945 --> 01:03:41.905
Testament of Father Prescott.

722
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:52.785
"Concerning the witch
and the bride of Satan."

723
01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:56.833
Mary Elnor.

724
01:03:57.007 --> 01:03:59.357
DELGARDE:
For the trumpet will sound.

725
01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:02.490
the dead will be raised...

726
01:04:02.664 --> 01:04:04.101
incorruptible...

727
01:04:05.885 --> 01:04:08.235
and we shall be changed.

728
01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:10.847
NATALIE:
Mary performed miracles.

729
01:04:11.021 --> 01:04:12.587
She could heal the sick.

730
01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:15.068
Jesus. this is...No. no. keep-- Keep reading.

731
01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:19.203
NATALIE:
She claimed the Virgin Mary

732
01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:21.509
was speaking through her.

733
01:04:21.683 --> 01:04:24.730
She would heal you if
you pledged your soul to her.

734
01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:28.125
Anyone who challenged her
met tragic ends.

735
01:04:29.822 --> 01:04:32.303
Finally.
the town fought back.

736
01:04:32.477 --> 01:04:34.783
Mary was captured
and submerged

737
01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:38.352
in the icy waters of--Pequod Creek.

738
01:04:38.526 --> 01:04:40.659
Mary confessed
to serving Satan.

739
01:04:40.833 --> 01:04:47.013
As punishment. a mask
was nailed onto Mary's face...

740
01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:50.451
in the image
of the Blessed Virgin.

741
01:04:54.455 --> 01:04:56.066
NATALIE:
Mary was hanged
by an ancient oak

742
01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.633
in the shadow of the church.

743
01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:00.200
In the name
of Christ. our Lord...

744
01:05:00.374 --> 01:05:01.898
NATALIE:
Her body was burned.

745
01:05:02.072 --> 01:05:03.595
her ashes and her soul
imprisoned

746
01:05:03.769 --> 01:05:06.598
inside a kern baby.Contain her!

747
01:05:13.431 --> 01:05:16.042
We command the soul
of William Hagan.

748
01:05:16.216 --> 01:05:17.870
:
Alice...

749
01:05:18.044 --> 01:05:19.567
In the sight of this world...

750
01:05:22.135 --> 01:05:23.136
he is now dead.

751
01:05:29.534 --> 01:05:31.014
Mary has spoken to me.

752
01:05:34.408 --> 01:05:37.150
Tonight is the Feast
of the Immaculate Conception.

753
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.153
To celebrate.

754
01:05:40.327 --> 01:05:43.113
Mary wants us
to hold a service at the shrine.

755
01:05:46.594 --> 01:05:50.642
NATALIE:
After Mary's death.
her miracles were extinguished.

756
01:05:52.209 --> 01:05:56.082
Those she had healed
all relapsed.

757
01:05:56.256 --> 01:05:58.650
Jesus. Father Hagan
must have found this book.

758
01:05:58.824 --> 01:06:02.088
He discovered the truth.
That's why Mary killed him.

759
01:06:02.262 --> 01:06:05.309
Hagan believed that...

760
01:06:05.483 --> 01:06:08.965
wherever God goes.
the unholy follows.

761
01:06:09.139 --> 01:06:11.315
These miracles.
they are not God.

762
01:06:11.489 --> 01:06:14.405
Join us at this service. It's Mary Elnor...

763
01:06:14.579 --> 01:06:16.624
Pray to Mary. ...posing as the Virgin Mary.

764
01:06:16.798 --> 01:06:19.584
Open your heart to her. Doing the devil's work.

765
01:06:19.758 --> 01:06:22.891
She brings an urgent message
to share with the entire world.

766
01:06:23.066 --> 01:06:24.763
if you believe in her.

767
01:06:24.937 --> 01:06:27.461
ALL:
I believe! I believe!

768
01:06:27.635 --> 01:06:31.552
I believe!
I believe! I believe...

769
01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:41.475
Natalie.

770
01:06:47.655 --> 01:06:48.743
What?

771
01:07:05.717 --> 01:07:07.197
Fenn?

772
01:07:22.777 --> 01:07:24.823
Run!

773
01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:28.914
GERRY:
Go!

774
01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:36.574
NATALIE:
We need to warn Alice.

775
01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:39.359
Alice. did you have a vision?

776
01:07:39.533 --> 01:07:41.318
Alice. please. please.

777
01:07:41.492 --> 01:07:43.276
What do you have to say
to the people--?

778
01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.148
Not right now.
Please. please. please.

779
01:07:45.322 --> 01:07:47.193
Back away.Alice. a couple more questions.

780
01:07:47.367 --> 01:07:49.804
Not right now.

781
01:07:49.978 --> 01:07:52.677
WOMAN:
Alice. will she be healed?

782
01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:15.047
Now is not a good time. Monica. You got a deal.

783
01:08:15.221 --> 01:08:16.875
The Special Section desk
is yours.

784
01:08:17.049 --> 01:08:18.529
but I want you
in the office today.

785
01:08:18.703 --> 01:08:19.878
I want your interviews
with Alice.

786
01:08:20.052 --> 01:08:21.009
and I want access to her.

787
01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:22.750
The story. no. I. uh--

788
01:08:22.924 --> 01:08:24.535
Listen to me.
I got it all wrong.

789
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:26.841
Wait. what is this?
Did you get a better offer?

790
01:08:27.015 --> 01:08:30.236
No. you are not listening.
All right? We need to kill it.

791
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:32.673
Fenn. you're back.

792
01:08:32.847 --> 01:08:34.806
This is your last chance.
You've got it all.

793
01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:38.375
Look. I know you. You would
sell your soul for a story.

794
01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:41.160
I'm pretty sure I already did.

795
01:08:45.164 --> 01:08:46.339
We gotta hurry.

796
01:08:54.869 --> 01:08:56.654
Alice is in the convent.

797
01:09:04.096 --> 01:09:05.489
SECRETARY:
Sir. he's in a meeting.

798
01:09:05.663 --> 01:09:07.839
Mr. Fenn.

799
01:09:08.013 --> 01:09:11.234
Before he died. Father Hagan
discovered the truth.

800
01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:14.976
Here. 175 years ago. 1845.

801
01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.848
A woman named Mary Elnor

802
01:09:17.022 --> 01:09:19.938
performed exactly
the same healings as Alice.

803
01:09:20.112 --> 01:09:24.029
But the source of her power
wasn't divine. It was satanic.

804
01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:27.250
I know all about this. Mr. Fenn.

805
01:09:27.424 --> 01:09:29.339
As soon as
the first miracle was reported.

806
01:09:29.513 --> 01:09:31.558
I had my staff
research Banfield.

807
01:09:31.732 --> 01:09:33.995
Mary Elnor's confession
is preserved

808
01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.954
in the diocese archives.

809
01:09:36.128 --> 01:09:38.609
Why was I not
informed about this?

810
01:09:38.783 --> 01:09:41.307
Informed about what?

811
01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:44.049
An ugly occurrence
of vigilante justice

812
01:09:44.223 --> 01:09:46.747
that happened almost
two centuries ago?

813
01:09:46.921 --> 01:09:48.271
Mary killed him.

814
01:09:48.445 --> 01:09:51.709
Father Hagan
committed suicide. Mr. Fenn.

815
01:09:51.883 --> 01:09:53.058
Bullshit.

816
01:09:54.842 --> 01:09:57.367
She will kill anyone
that tries to stop her.

817
01:09:57.541 --> 01:09:59.891
What do you
expect me to do. hmm?

818
01:10:00.065 --> 01:10:01.936
Call off the service?

819
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:04.200
What service?

820
01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:05.984
The Lady spoke through Alice.

821
01:10:06.158 --> 01:10:08.465
She asked for a service
to be held at the shrine

822
01:10:08.639 --> 01:10:10.945
to celebrate the Feast
of the Immaculate Conception.

823
01:10:11.119 --> 01:10:13.034
Absolutely not.
You cannot go through with this.

824
01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:16.124
She will claim the souls
of everyone who believes her.

825
01:10:16.299 --> 01:10:20.259
Why? Why do you do this
to yourself. Mr. Fenn. hm?

826
01:10:20.433 --> 01:10:22.609
You have it all.

827
01:10:22.783 --> 01:10:26.874
Why do you want to blow up
your career all over again?

828
01:10:27.048 --> 01:10:29.007
Because it's the truth.

829
01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:32.663
And make no mistake about it.
I will tell the world.

830
01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:34.447
And who would believe you?

831
01:10:37.058 --> 01:10:40.540
No. the sisters won't let me
in to see her. Bishop's orders.

832
01:10:40.714 --> 01:10:42.238
Look. I am in
the diocese archives.

833
01:10:42.412 --> 01:10:44.936
and I think
I found something here.

834
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:48.374
Uh. listen to this.
Mary's final confession.

835
01:10:48.548 --> 01:10:50.376
She was pregnant.

836
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:53.379
Before she was captured.
Mary gave birth to a son.

837
01:10:53.553 --> 01:10:55.773
And that infant was claimed
by a local landowner.

838
01:10:55.947 --> 01:10:59.124
Um. all right. his name...

839
01:10:59.298 --> 01:11:00.865
Jesus.

840
01:11:01.039 --> 01:11:02.649
His name is Nicholas Pagett.

841
01:11:02.823 --> 01:11:04.085
Pagett?

842
01:11:05.348 --> 01:11:06.871
Yeah. Alice...

843
01:11:07.045 --> 01:11:08.525
Alice is Mary's descendant.

844
01:11:08.699 --> 01:11:10.135
And Mary made a pact
with the devil

845
01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:13.138
for eternal life and power.

846
01:11:13.312 --> 01:11:15.227
Um...

847
01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:21.364
"I live through my children."

848
01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:24.758
Alice.

849
01:11:24.932 --> 01:11:26.847
She's gonna live
again through Alice.

850
01:11:27.021 --> 01:11:29.763
You're breaking up. Fenn. Hello?

851
01:12:59.462 --> 01:13:02.682
Now? Now do you believe me?

852
01:13:02.856 --> 01:13:05.250
Alice is Mary's descendant.

853
01:13:05.424 --> 01:13:07.557
Mary's pact with the devil.

854
01:13:07.731 --> 01:13:10.821
"I will live
through my children."

855
01:13:10.995 --> 01:13:12.910
Mary can only live
through her own bloodline.

856
01:13:14.912 --> 01:13:17.480
Alice is in danger.Everyone is in danger.

857
01:13:17.654 --> 01:13:19.220
Tonight's service.

858
01:13:20.874 --> 01:13:23.311
All those people
praying to Mary.

859
01:13:23.486 --> 01:13:26.010
feeding her with their faith.

860
01:13:26.184 --> 01:13:28.882
Faith in evil empowers evil.

861
01:13:50.121 --> 01:13:52.079
Ah. gentlemen.

862
01:13:54.517 --> 01:13:57.476
I'd like you
to keep an eye out for this man.

863
01:13:58.608 --> 01:14:00.697
His name's Gerald Fenn.

864
01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:02.916
He's a troublemaker.

865
01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:06.529
We don't want any.
uh. unnecessary incidents. Okay?

866
01:14:06.703 --> 01:14:07.704
Yes. sir.Understood.

867
01:14:07.878 --> 01:14:09.096
Thank you.

868
01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:25.504
NATALIE:
The bishop has Alice sequestered
till after the service.

869
01:14:25.678 --> 01:14:27.375
DELGARDE:
By then it will be too late.

870
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:29.116
According to the satanic rites.

871
01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:31.379
Mary will perform a mockery
of the Holy Trinity.

872
01:14:31.554 --> 01:14:34.774
She will call on the faithful
to pledge devotion three times.

873
01:14:34.948 --> 01:14:37.690
The third time.
she will take their souls

874
01:14:37.864 --> 01:14:40.214
and condemn them
to an eternity in hell.

875
01:14:50.442 --> 01:14:53.271
So after the choir
finishes the Angelus.

876
01:14:53.445 --> 01:14:55.012
I'll perform the supplications

877
01:14:55.186 --> 01:14:57.884
and the responsorial psalm.
and then you come up...

878
01:14:58.058 --> 01:15:00.496
:
Alice. it's time.

879
01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:02.889
You okay?

880
01:15:03.063 --> 01:15:05.588
Alice. you listening?

881
01:15:05.762 --> 01:15:07.459
Okay.

882
01:15:57.248 --> 01:15:59.032
My queen and my mother.

883
01:15:59.206 --> 01:16:01.905
I give myself entirely to you.

884
01:16:02.079 --> 01:16:04.864
And to show
my devotion to you...

885
01:16:05.038 --> 01:16:07.606
I consecrate to you this day

886
01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:12.611
my eyes. my ears.
my mouth. my heart.

887
01:16:12.785 --> 01:16:15.527
my whole being without reserve.

888
01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:19.052
Wherefore. good mother.
as I am your own.

889
01:16:19.226 --> 01:16:23.709
keep me and guard me
as your property and possession.

890
01:16:23.883 --> 01:16:24.884
Amen.

891
01:16:25.058 --> 01:16:26.364
ALL:
Amen.

892
01:16:33.371 --> 01:16:34.633
Let us pray.

893
01:16:37.549 --> 01:16:39.551
DELGARDE:
This ritual is our last hope.

894
01:16:39.725 --> 01:16:41.248
I will use the kern baby.

895
01:16:41.422 --> 01:16:43.816
imprison her soul
like they did in the past.

896
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:46.340
It's my fault.

897
01:16:46.514 --> 01:16:49.735
I broke that thing.
I released Mary. I--

898
01:16:49.909 --> 01:16:51.345
I was trying to beef up

899
01:16:51.519 --> 01:16:53.347
what I thought
was a ridiculous story.

900
01:16:53.521 --> 01:16:56.699
You never told me that.I-- I tried. I wanted to--

901
01:16:56.873 --> 01:17:00.964
God always offers
an opportunity for redemption.

902
01:17:01.138 --> 01:17:05.838
He often chooses a sinner
to serve his divine purpose.

903
01:17:06.012 --> 01:17:08.188
Wait. are you saying
that God chose me?

904
01:17:08.362 --> 01:17:11.322
I'm saying our Lord works
in mysterious ways.

905
01:17:13.367 --> 01:17:16.414
Some more mysterious
than others.

906
01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:19.896
This calls
for the blessing of a bishop...

907
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:24.248
or. in a pinch. a monsignor.

908
01:17:24.422 --> 01:17:28.774
Next. the wax
must be sealed by holy fire.

909
01:17:28.948 --> 01:17:31.864
This flame signifies
the presence of the living God.

910
01:17:54.191 --> 01:17:55.409
DELGARDE:
Get back.

911
01:18:02.808 --> 01:18:04.592
Oh. no!

912
01:18:04.767 --> 01:18:07.944
Oh! Oh. my God! Oh. my God!

913
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.223
Oh. we can't stop Mary
without Delgarde.

914
01:18:26.397 --> 01:18:28.399
Look at all these people
praying to her.

915
01:18:28.573 --> 01:18:31.097
She's feeding off their faith.
growing stronger.

916
01:18:32.838 --> 01:18:33.883
What destroys faith?

917
01:18:36.102 --> 01:18:37.190
Doubt.

918
01:18:37.364 --> 01:18:38.278
Doubt weakens faith.

919
01:18:38.452 --> 01:18:39.627
Doubt leads to damnation.

920
01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.631
If we can get those people
to stop believing in Mary.

921
01:18:43.806 --> 01:18:45.155
we can take away her power.

922
01:18:47.331 --> 01:18:51.248
God. the father of heaven.
have mercy on us.

923
01:18:51.422 --> 01:18:54.294
Lord. have mercy.ALL: Lord. have mercy.

924
01:18:54.468 --> 01:18:58.211
God. the son. the redeemer.
have mercy on us.

925
01:18:58.385 --> 01:19:01.388
Christ. have mercy.ALL: Christ. have mercy.

926
01:19:01.562 --> 01:19:05.131
God. the holy spirit.
have mercy on us.

927
01:19:05.305 --> 01:19:07.743
Lord. have mercy.ALL: Lord. have mercy.

928
01:19:07.917 --> 01:19:09.657
Amen.ALL: Amen.

929
01:19:13.444 --> 01:19:14.706
WOMAN 1:
Alice!

930
01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.100
WOMAN 2:
Alice!

931
01:19:17.274 --> 01:19:19.363
MAN: Alice!WOMAN 3: Alice. Bless us.

932
01:19:27.632 --> 01:19:30.548
She wants you
to pledge your faith to her.

933
01:19:30.722 --> 01:19:33.159
Let her into your hearts.
Pray to her.

934
01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:36.119
Pray to our Lady of Banfield.

935
01:19:41.646 --> 01:19:42.473
Hail. Mary.

936
01:19:44.257 --> 01:19:46.782
You are the undying spirit.

937
01:19:46.956 --> 01:19:49.741
The eternal. the all-powerful.

938
01:19:51.134 --> 01:19:53.527
Hail. Mary of Banfield.

939
01:19:53.701 --> 01:19:55.399
ALL:
Hail. Mary of Banfield.

940
01:19:55.573 --> 01:19:57.749
We pledge our hearts to you.

941
01:19:57.923 --> 01:20:00.273
We vow our everlasting devotion.

942
01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:04.625
Our souls are at your mercy.

943
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.932
Hail. Mary of Banfield.

944
01:20:07.106 --> 01:20:09.282
ALL:
Hail. Mary of Banfield!

945
01:20:09.456 --> 01:20:11.719
In one voice we call to you.

946
01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:13.243
Come to us.

947
01:20:13.417 --> 01:20:16.376
Heal our pain.
relieve our suffering.

948
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:17.943
Lead us!

949
01:20:18.117 --> 01:20:19.815
:
Hail. Mary of Banfield!

950
01:20:19.989 --> 01:20:22.121
Hail. Mary of Banfield!

951
01:20:22.295 --> 01:20:24.820
Hail. Mary of Banfield!

952
01:20:24.994 --> 01:20:26.038
Hail. Mary of Banfield!

953
01:20:26.212 --> 01:20:28.824
Hail. Mary of Banfield!

954
01:20:28.998 --> 01:20:31.696
:
Now. Alice. Now is the time.

955
01:20:35.656 --> 01:20:38.659
Do you offer your souls to Mary?

956
01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.096
ALL:
Yes!

957
01:20:41.662 --> 01:20:43.012
It's all a lie.

958
01:20:45.884 --> 01:20:47.886
I faked the miracles.

959
01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.757
Fenn.GERRY: Listen to me.

960
01:20:49.932 --> 01:20:52.369
Do you offer your souls to Mary?

961
01:20:52.543 --> 01:20:53.979
ALL:
Yes!

962
01:20:55.502 --> 01:20:56.852
Come on.

963
01:20:58.114 --> 01:21:00.029
Alice! Alice!

964
01:21:00.203 --> 01:21:02.248
MARY:
One more time. Alice.

965
01:21:05.773 --> 01:21:09.299
Do you offer your souls to--

966
01:21:11.431 --> 01:21:15.348
Alice! Mary is not
who you think she is.

967
01:21:15.522 --> 01:21:17.785
She is deceiving you.

968
01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.787
The miracles are false.CROWD: Boo!

969
01:21:22.616 --> 01:21:24.705
There's no Mary.
There never was.

970
01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:27.970
No!

971
01:21:31.843 --> 01:21:32.931
Let him speak.

972
01:21:38.806 --> 01:21:40.025
Let him be.

973
01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:43.289
Go ahead. Mr. Fenn.

974
01:21:45.204 --> 01:21:47.815
I fabricated the entire story.
I made it up.

975
01:21:49.643 --> 01:21:50.949
MARY:
Lies!

976
01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:55.171
Mary healed me.

977
01:21:55.345 --> 01:21:58.652
Alice. I am so sorry.

978
01:22:00.567 --> 01:22:02.830
Your illness.
it resolved on its own.

979
01:22:03.005 --> 01:22:05.224
She cured my boy.

980
01:22:07.618 --> 01:22:09.098
It's called the placebo effect.

981
01:22:11.143 --> 01:22:12.971
Your boy...

982
01:22:13.145 --> 01:22:15.495
Your boy believed he could walk.

983
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:16.801
And he did.

984
01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:20.936
Father Hagan raised you.

985
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:22.720
He loved you.

986
01:22:22.894 --> 01:22:24.809
He was your family.

987
01:22:24.983 --> 01:22:26.854
She killed him.

988
01:22:27.029 --> 01:22:29.074
I am Mary.

989
01:22:29.248 --> 01:22:32.643
You prayed to me.
and I listened.

990
01:22:32.817 --> 01:22:34.036
Father Hagan...

991
01:22:38.692 --> 01:22:40.868
You asked me to hush it up.
to cover it up. and I did.

992
01:22:41.043 --> 01:22:42.740
You can't believe this man.

993
01:22:42.914 --> 01:22:44.829
He's a blasphemer.

994
01:22:45.003 --> 01:22:46.657
An atheist.

995
01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:49.877
Mary has been using you.

996
01:22:50.052 --> 01:22:51.270
Trust me.

997
01:22:51.444 --> 01:22:53.446
I need you to trust me.

998
01:22:54.795 --> 01:22:55.840
Fight her!

999
01:22:58.930 --> 01:23:00.453
It was all me.

1000
01:23:02.586 --> 01:23:04.762
I made it all up for a story.

1001
01:23:09.593 --> 01:23:12.422
Just... let me
ask you something.

1002
01:23:12.596 --> 01:23:15.903
Tell me. what is easier
for you to believe. that--

1003
01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:18.906
That an unscrupulous journalist
created a hoax or that--

1004
01:23:20.473 --> 01:23:23.128
Or that God himself

1005
01:23:23.302 --> 01:23:25.826
reached down and touched...

1006
01:23:38.448 --> 01:23:41.190
Alice. Trust me.

1007
01:23:41.364 --> 01:23:44.019
You have to stop these people
from believing in her.

1008
01:23:45.977 --> 01:23:50.808
Fight her.MARY: Alice. listen to me.

1009
01:23:50.982 --> 01:23:53.506
Finish the prayer.

1010
01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:57.293
They must pledge
their souls to me

1011
01:23:57.467 --> 01:24:02.515
or you will never speak again.

1012
01:24:04.561 --> 01:24:06.432
Mr. Fenn is telling the truth.

1013
01:24:06.606 --> 01:24:08.130
What?

1014
01:24:13.831 --> 01:24:14.875
Mary isn't real.

1015
01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:18.575
Son of a bitch.

1016
01:24:23.754 --> 01:24:24.668
WOMAN:
She lied!

1017
01:24:29.847 --> 01:24:31.588
MAN 1:
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

1018
01:24:31.762 --> 01:24:33.329
MAN 2:
It's all a fake!

1019
01:25:03.576 --> 01:25:05.274
My legs!SOPHIA: Toby!

1020
01:25:05.448 --> 01:25:06.971
I can't move my legs.DAN: Toby!

1021
01:25:11.497 --> 01:25:12.542
SECURITY:
Move! Get out!

1022
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:12.079
What in God's name?

1023
01:27:08.048 --> 01:27:09.659
Fenn!

1024
01:27:13.837 --> 01:27:15.578
No!

1025
01:27:44.694 --> 01:27:46.565
Alice was your only descendent.

1026
01:27:50.134 --> 01:27:51.527
You will never live again.

1027
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:17.292
Alice. Alice.

1028
01:28:32.524 --> 01:28:33.699
All right. look.

1029
01:28:36.223 --> 01:28:38.748
We both know that
I'm not really good at this.

1030
01:28:40.402 --> 01:28:45.232
But. Alice. she. uh...

1031
01:28:45.407 --> 01:28:48.192
She sacrificed herself for me.

1032
01:28:55.025 --> 01:28:57.375
Please. God.

1033
01:28:57.549 --> 01:29:00.378
Just... Just let her live.

1034
01:29:01.423 --> 01:29:02.380
Please.

1035
01:29:15.785 --> 01:29:17.656
Hey! Hi.

1036
01:29:28.406 --> 01:29:30.452
You can't hear me?

1037
01:29:34.107 --> 01:29:37.546
I have never said anything
worth hearing my whole life.

1038
01:29:42.464 --> 01:29:43.987
Thank you.

1039
01:30:53.926 --> 01:30:55.537
He. um...

1040
01:30:55.711 --> 01:30:58.670
He was a good man. Alice.

1041
01:30:58.844 --> 01:31:02.718
I have no doubt
that he is watching over you.

1042
01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:07.374
How do I know?

1043
01:31:09.202 --> 01:31:10.247
Faith.

1044
01:31:17.559 --> 01:31:18.603
I've been practicing.

1045
01:31:21.388 --> 01:31:24.043
Well. I heard the. uh--
The local paper's hiring.

1046
01:31:25.915 --> 01:31:27.612
Pretty sure
no one's gonna hire me

1047
01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:32.443
Well. I didn't say anything
about journalism.

1048
01:31:32.617 --> 01:31:34.489
It's more like
local zoning laws

1049
01:31:34.663 --> 01:31:36.273
and the Farmers' Almanac.

1050
01:31:38.318 --> 01:31:40.146
You can think about it.Okay.

1051
01:31:42.192 --> 01:31:43.149
Hey.

1052
01:31:44.934 --> 01:31:46.892
There was no pulse.

1053
01:31:47.066 --> 01:31:50.200
She wasn't breathing.
She was gone.

1054
01:31:52.463 --> 01:31:54.465
Maybe God was present after all.
