- Fine.

15
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:53.206
- Don't lie to me.

16
00:01:53.206 --> 00:01:54.103
- I'm okay.

17
00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:59.793

00:01:59.793 --> 00:02:00.620
I promise.

Hey.

- Hello.

26
00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:22.482
I'm here to install the
new security system.

27
00:02:22.482 --> 00:02:23.310
- Yeah. Come on in.

28
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.793
- Okay. thank you.

29
00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:05.517
- You have a lot of experience
in our industry. Mr. Meyers.

30
00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:06.379
[Gary chuckles]

31
00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.620
- I would say so.

32
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.689
I began as an installer.
my last company.

33
00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.793
and I moved up to
IT. so wherever you
need me. I can work.

34
00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:15.620
- I guess it's in
your blood. huh?

35
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.344
- I really love helping
people stay safe.

36
00:03:19.344 --> 00:03:21.034
We're kinda like policemen.
just like my father.

37
00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.310
except we're there
before the police.

38
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.379
I think we're the
real first responders.

39
00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.275
- What made you
leave your last job?

40
00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.103
[Gary sighs]

41
00:03:31.103 --> 00:03:32.344
- That's a good question.

42
00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:34.103
I think just time for a
fresh start. you know?

43
00:03:34.103 --> 00:03:36.862
I was also growing tired
of the winters in Chicago.

44
00:03:36.862 --> 00:03:38.689
and when I was a kid.
we would visit Atlanta.

45
00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.827
My grandmother lived here.
and I've just always loved it.

46
00:03:41.827 --> 00:03:45.965
- Well. Gary. you have
everything we're looking for.

47
00:03:45.965 --> 00:03:47.896
Once we get an all-clear
in the background check.

48
00:03:47.896 --> 00:03:50.137
I feel confident that we
can offer you a position

49
00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:53.172
as a command center operator.

50
00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:56.172
- That would be
wonderful. Thank you.

51
00:03:57.517 --> 00:04:00.206
- Okay. Ms. Greene. almost done.

52
00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:02.931
Just need to mount
the interior cameras.

53
00:04:02.931 --> 00:04:04.551
and they are included with
the smart home package.

54
00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:06.689
- Interior what?

55
00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:07.896
- Yeah. well. you
know. we've got-

56
00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:10.000
- Oh yeah. my friend
Sylvia has them.

57
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.448
and she went out of
town and looked in

58
00:04:12.448 --> 00:04:14.689
and saw 30 teenagers
in her house.

59
00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.068
- [Sarah] Mm-hm.

60
00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:17.586
- Granddaughter threw a party.

61
00:04:17.586 --> 00:04:22.344
So Sylvia yelled at him over
the speakers and shut it down.

62
00:04:22.344 --> 00:04:25.068
- Yeah. but I don't
have a teenager.

63
00:04:25.068 --> 00:04:25.896
- Not yet.

64
00:04:27.344 --> 00:04:28.620
- Well. you know. you can
always keep an eye on your son

65
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.000
when he is home
after school too.

66
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.896
[Sarah sighs]

67
00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.482
- How exactly do they work?

68
00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:34.931
- I get this a lot.

69
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:37.517
So. look. they only activate
if the alarm goes off.

70
00:04:37.517 --> 00:04:39.724
The software won't
even allow it.

71
00:04:39.724 --> 00:04:41.206
- I don't know.

72
00:04:41.206 --> 00:04:43.241
- You get an alert if
anyone ever enters your home

73
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.724
with the alarm on.

74
00:04:44.724 --> 00:04:46.931
and the cameras are just a
great deterrent for criminals.

75
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:48.724
They make it possible
to scare away suspects.

76
00:04:48.724 --> 00:04:52.000
and we can also ID them
and get 'em off the street.

77
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.517
Cameras actually make
neighborhoods safer.

78
00:04:54.517 --> 00:04:56.413
- So it's my civic duty?

79
00:04:56.413 --> 00:04:57.413
- Seems like your mom thinks so.

80
00:04:57.413 --> 00:05:00.448
[anxious instrumental music]

81
00:05:00.448 --> 00:05:03.482
[crickets chirping]

82
00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:14.068
- Don't think just 'cause
you're working day shift

83
00:05:14.068 --> 00:05:15.862
you're not gonna see any action.

84
00:05:15.862 --> 00:05:18.000
Most burglaries take
place during the day.

85
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.413
when the homeowners are away.

86
00:05:21.827 --> 00:05:24.482
Okay. back door gets
kicked in. alarm goes off.

87
00:05:24.482 --> 00:05:25.793
What do you do?

88
00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:33.413
- Identify the company

89
00:05:33.413 --> 00:05:35.551
and then ask the intruder
to identify himself.

90
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:36.931
- Exactly.

91
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:40.241
And what happens when
he doesn't answer?

92
00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:44.241
- Well. in that case. we would
order him to leave the home

93
00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:46.931
and tell him the
police are on the way.

94
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:48.758
- Okay. let's hear it.

95
00:05:50.275 --> 00:05:51.310
- Hm?

96
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.724
- Scare this guy off. Gary.

97
00:05:53.724 --> 00:05:54.620
- Oh. okay.

98
00:05:55.827 --> 00:05:57.965
[Gary clears throat]

99
00:05:57.965 --> 00:05:59.827
- Safehouse Home Security!

100
00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:01.689
Identify yourself!

101
00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:03.275
Leave the home now!

102
00:06:04.482 --> 00:06:07.448
Police are on the way!
Leave the home now!

103
00:06:07.448 --> 00:06:08.206
- Perfect!

104
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.724
Forceful. Confident.

105
00:06:11.724 --> 00:06:14.758
The guy has no choice but
to run. and that's our goal.

106
00:06:14.758 --> 00:06:17.413
is get the bad guys
outta the house.

107
00:06:17.413 --> 00:06:21.034
[delicate orchestral music]

108
00:06:26.137 --> 00:06:28.448
- No. I'm sick of this crap.

109
00:06:29.896 --> 00:06:31.172
- What's wrong?

110
00:06:31.172 --> 00:06:32.655
- If I have to eat
another damn salad.

111
00:06:32.655 --> 00:06:35.206
I'm gonna strangle somebody.

112
00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:38.379
- I've done that
before. It gets old.

113
00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:41.896
- Eat too much salad.
or strangle somebody?

114
00:06:42.896 --> 00:06:45.206
[both laughing]

115
00:06:45.206 --> 00:06:47.827
But it's working. though.
I'm down 15 pounds.

116
00:06:47.827 --> 00:06:49.310
- Wow.
- Mm-hm.

117
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.206
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

118
00:06:51.206 --> 00:06:52.689
Gotta pass that
physical assessment

119
00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:54.724
to get hired by the GSBI.

120
00:06:56.206 --> 00:07:00.103
The Georgia State
Bureau of Investigation.

121
00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:04.275
Yeah. Can't pass that
physical with all it is juicy.

122
00:07:04.275 --> 00:07:07.068
[Gary chuckles]

123
00:07:07.068 --> 00:07:08.620
- So you wanna be an agent?

124
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.413
- No. I am an agent. They
just haven't hired me yet.

125
00:07:11.413 --> 00:07:12.586
- Hm.

126
00:07:12.586 --> 00:07:14.034
My dad was a cop.

127
00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:16.413
- Oh. damn. a cop.

128
00:07:16.413 --> 00:07:17.655
- [Gray] Mm.

129
00:07:17.655 --> 00:07:20.413
- You couldn't do
shit growing up. huh?

130
00:07:20.413 --> 00:07:21.724
- Hm.

131
00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:22.931
I'm Gary.

132
00:07:22.931 --> 00:07:25.862
- I know who you
are. The new guy.

133
00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.344
- I'm Trina.

134
00:07:27.344 --> 00:07:28.172
The vet.

135
00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:32.482
Seen it all. forgot it.
and seen it all again.

136
00:07:32.482 --> 00:07:33.793
[microwave beeping]

137
00:07:33.793 --> 00:07:36.586
- Well. Trina. if the
GSBI doesn't work out.

138
00:07:36.586 --> 00:07:39.034
you should be a standup.

139
00:07:39.034 --> 00:07:40.310
[Trina chuckles]

140
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.586
- Oh. come on. Kevin!

141
00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.172
- Sorry about that.

142
00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:46.241
[Gary sighs]

143
00:07:46.241 --> 00:07:49.758
- Yeah. Kevin. kinda ruined
this lunch moment over here.

144
00:07:49.758 --> 00:07:50.931
- Sorry.

145
00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:52.034
- You should be.

146
00:07:52.034 --> 00:07:53.137
- Excuse me?

147
00:07:53.137 --> 00:07:55.482
[low tense music]

148
00:07:55.482 --> 00:07:56.896
- Maybe if you were a
little more considerate.

149
00:07:56.896 --> 00:07:59.827
this place wouldn't
smell like a house fire.

150
00:07:59.827 --> 00:08:03.344
- It's not that serious.
[chuckles anxiously]

151
00:08:03.344 --> 00:08:05.344
- Oh. no. it is that serious.

152
00:08:05.344 --> 00:08:07.344
- Okay. Gary. it's just popcorn.

153
00:08:07.344 --> 00:08:11.103
Just a little popcorn.
Just a little popcorn.

154
00:08:11.103 --> 00:08:12.758
It's okay.

155
00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:14.275
- People are selfish.

156
00:08:14.275 --> 00:08:16.655
You know. I just call
it out when I see it.

157
00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:17.827
- My bad. dog.

158
00:08:17.827 --> 00:08:20.862
- No. no. no. I'm not your dog.

159
00:08:20.862 --> 00:08:22.310
- What is your problem. man?

160
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.758
- It's okay. Just
let it go. Kevin.

161
00:08:23.758 --> 00:08:25.000
Just let it go.

162
00:08:26.275 --> 00:08:27.103
Gary!

163
00:08:28.482 --> 00:08:29.793
Making friends and
influencing people

164
00:08:29.793 --> 00:08:32.517
on your first day
of school. huh?

165
00:08:32.517 --> 00:08:35.344
- You see. Trina. today
he's burning popcorn.

166
00:08:35.344 --> 00:08:37.034
and then one day he's not
paying attention at his desk.

167
00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:41.103
and someone that needs help
calls him. and they get hurt.

168
00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:43.000
The little things turn
into the big things.

169
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.137
- Who the hell are you telling?
I was 115 in high school.

170
00:08:47.137 --> 00:08:48.103
- Ha ha! See?

171
00:08:48.103 --> 00:08:48.931
[Trina laughing]

172
00:08:48.931 --> 00:08:50.103

I heard you were managing
some big hedge fund.

199

- I was. but I was miserable.

200

always wanted to do.

I just never wanted
to admit it to myself.

204
00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:48.551
- Wow.

205
00:09:48.551 --> 00:09:50.068
That's great.

206
00:09:50.068 --> 00:09:52.724
Sixth grade is when
math went south for me.

207
00:09:52.724 --> 00:09:53.724

to save these kids

my MFA in writing.

'cause I wanna teach eventually.

215
00:10:05.586 --> 00:10:07.586

do think alike.

216
00:10:07.586 --> 00:10:09.000
What's your son's name? I'll
keep an eye out for him.

00:16:05.137 --> 00:16:07.068
I mean. really captivating.

361
00:16:07.068 --> 00:16:08.896
- Well. so were you. Gary.

362
00:16:08.896 --> 00:16:12.172
And it's so great to
meet you in person.

363
00:16:12.172 --> 00:16:13.482
- Yeah? Not a...

364
00:16:13.482 --> 00:16:14.310
little disappointed?

365
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.137
[Sarah chuckles]

366
00:16:15.137 --> 00:16:15.965
- Not at all.

367
00:16:15.965 --> 00:16:18.413
[Gary chuckling]

368
00:16:18.413 --> 00:16:21.965
- You know what was crazy is.
the day you were broken into.

369
00:16:21.965 --> 00:16:23.793
that was my first
day on the job.

370
00:16:23.793 --> 00:16:25.068
- What?

371
00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:25.896
- [Gary] Yeah.

372
00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:27.241
- I'm your first call?

373
00:16:27.241 --> 00:16:28.758
- You were.

374
00:16:28.758 --> 00:16:30.655
- Well. you're a natural.

375
00:16:30.655 --> 00:16:33.275
What were you doing
before Safehouse?

376
00:16:33.275 --> 00:16:35.275
- Security in Chicago.

377
00:16:35.275 --> 00:16:38.620
and then Safehouse recruited
me to be VP of Operations.

378
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.448
which basically means
I spend about a month

379
00:16:40.448 --> 00:16:42.586
in each department. undercover.

380
00:16:42.586 --> 00:16:44.724
and I address what
the company needs.

381
00:16:44.724 --> 00:16:45.620
- Nice.

382
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.310
- Yeah. Don't tell anymore.

383
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.793
- Our secret.

384
00:16:48.793 --> 00:16:50.310
- I'm sorry.

385
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.310
I know you got a lot of
people to say goodbye to.

386
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.517
and I don't wanna hold you up.

387
00:16:52.517 --> 00:16:55.448
but it's really
great meeting you.

388
00:16:55.448 --> 00:16:57.655
- You. too. Gary.

389
00:16:57.655 --> 00:17:01.034
[soft orchestral music]

390
00:17:06.896 --> 00:17:09.862
[crickets chirping]

391
00:17:27.275 --> 00:17:29.344
[typing]

392
00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:33.172
Yeah. that sounds like
a really good idea.

393
00:17:33.172 --> 00:17:35.827
But I'm gonna meet up with
Kelci at Java Den in the morning

394
00:17:35.827 --> 00:17:38.827
and then I need to
go to the office.

395
00:17:39.965 --> 00:17:42.344
Yeah. I have showings also.

396
00:17:42.344 --> 00:17:43.172
[Sarah sighs]

397
00:17:43.172 --> 00:17:44.827
Okay. okay. Yes.

398
00:17:44.827 --> 00:17:46.724
Once an elementary
school principal.

399
00:17:46.724 --> 00:17:50.068
always an elementary
school principal.

400
00:17:50.068 --> 00:17:51.482
Okay. [laughs]

401
00:17:51.482 --> 00:17:52.655
Love you. Mom. Bye.

402
00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:54.689
[tense instrumental music]

403
00:17:54.689 --> 00:17:56.172
- But. you know.

404
00:17:56.172 --> 00:17:57.655
I mean. I'm glad to see
you. and how's Jalen doing?

405
00:17:57.655 --> 00:17:59.034
- He's doing good.
He's doing good.

406
00:17:59.034 --> 00:18:00.379
He's a little. we're
still a little shaken up.

407
00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:01.586
but it's fine.

408
00:18:01.586 --> 00:18:02.413
What about...

409
00:18:02.413 --> 00:18:03.241
- Sarah?

410
00:18:04.241 --> 00:18:05.103
- Oh!

411
00:18:05.103 --> 00:18:05.931
[Gary chuckles]

412
00:18:05.931 --> 00:18:06.758
Gary!
- Yeah.

413
00:18:06.758 --> 00:18:07.586
- Hey!

414
00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:08.586
- Good to see you.

415
00:18:08.586 --> 00:18:09.482
- This is my sister. Kelci.

416
00:18:09.482 --> 00:18:10.931
- How you doing. Kelci. Gary.

417
00:18:10.931 --> 00:18:12.103
- Oh.

418
00:18:12.103 --> 00:18:12.862
- I see beauty
runs in the family.

419
00:18:12.862 --> 00:18:13.758
[chuckling]

420
00:18:13.758 --> 00:18:15.275
- Well. it's nice to meet you.

421
00:18:15.275 --> 00:18:16.482
- [Gary] You as well.

422
00:18:16.482 --> 00:18:18.137
And thanks for looking
out for my big sis.

423
00:18:18.137 --> 00:18:19.862
- Very glad I was there to help.

424
00:18:19.862 --> 00:18:21.275
- Us too.

425
00:18:21.275 --> 00:18:22.758
- Yeah. well. I can't
believe I ran into you today.

426
00:18:22.758 --> 00:18:23.931
I'm actually just
grabbing a coffee.

427
00:18:23.931 --> 00:18:25.379
looking at some neighborhoods.

428
00:18:25.379 --> 00:18:26.896
I'm buying a place.

429
00:18:26.896 --> 00:18:28.448
- Oh.

430
00:18:28.448 --> 00:18:32.551
Well. if you need an agent.
that's how I earn my living.

431
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:34.137
- Really?

432
00:18:34.137 --> 00:18:35.965
I haven't hired anyone yet.

433
00:18:35.965 --> 00:18:37.379
Maybe we could talk
after I'm done looking.

434
00:18:37.379 --> 00:18:38.896
- Sounds great.

435
00:18:38.896 --> 00:18:40.103
- [Gary] Okay.

436
00:18:40.103 --> 00:18:40.620
- [Sarah] Let me
give you my card.

437
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.379
- Yeah.

438
00:18:42.586 --> 00:18:43.931
Great. Yeah.

439
00:18:43.931 --> 00:18:45.310
All right. I'll give you
a shot later this week.

440
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:46.275
- [Sarah] Okay.

441
00:18:46.275 --> 00:18:46.965
- Nice to meet you. Kelci.

442
00:18:46.965 --> 00:18:47.793
- You too.

443
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.103
He seems nice.

444
00:18:51.103 --> 00:18:52.551
You can get some
coins too. [laughing]

445
00:18:52.551 --> 00:18:53.586
- Exactly. That's
what I'm saying.

446
00:18:53.586 --> 00:18:54.448
Let me get my commission.

447
00:18:54.448 --> 00:18:57.206
[both laughing]

448
00:18:57.206 --> 00:19:01.000
- [Director] Tell us who you
are and what happened that day.

449
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.275
- My name's Gary Meyers.

450
00:19:02.275 --> 00:19:04.137
I'm an operator at
Safehouse Security.

451
00:19:04.137 --> 00:19:07.482
and I was at my desk. it was
about 1:30 in the afternoon.

452
00:19:07.482 --> 00:19:08.862
and I got an alert...

453
00:19:08.862 --> 00:19:10.517
- You show like
watching yourself

454
00:19:10.517 --> 00:19:12.310
with that pretty lady
on the commercial. huh?

455
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.965
[anxious instrumental music]

456
00:19:14.965 --> 00:19:16.034
- No.

457
00:19:16.034 --> 00:19:17.448
No. I was just...

458
00:19:18.862 --> 00:19:21.206
seeing what I could do better.

459
00:19:21.206 --> 00:19:22.793
You know.

460
00:19:22.793 --> 00:19:24.655
They're talking about making
me a Safehouse spokesperson.

461
00:19:24.655 --> 00:19:25.620
- Say what?

462
00:19:27.586 --> 00:19:28.517
Oh. you!

463
00:19:28.517 --> 00:19:29.965
You almost got me that time!

464
00:19:29.965 --> 00:19:34.827
I don't know why I
listen to you. [laughing]

465
00:19:35.482 --> 00:19:37.586
[typing]

466
00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:42.482
- Hi. Sarah. I'm
sorry that I'm late.

467
00:19:42.482 --> 00:19:44.034
On the phone with our CEO.

468
00:19:44.034 --> 00:19:46.689
That guy can talk for days.
just on and on and on. so...

469
00:19:46.689 --> 00:19:48.310
- It's not a problem.

470
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.344
You must be so busy learning
how Safehouse operates.

471
00:19:51.344 --> 00:19:54.000
So what department do
you have to go to next?

472
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.862
- What do you mean?

473
00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:57.310
- You know. you said
you have to spend time

474
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.310
in all the departments.

475
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.344
- Yes. I did.

476
00:20:00.655 --> 00:20:03.275
[laughs uncomfortably]

477
00:20:03.275 --> 00:20:04.137
IT is next.

478
00:20:05.034 --> 00:20:06.551
It's not really my thing.

479
00:20:06.551 --> 00:20:09.206
You know. I'm more of
a people person. but...

480
00:20:09.206 --> 00:20:10.379
IT.

481
00:20:10.379 --> 00:20:11.931
- So how are you
liking Atlanta so far?

482
00:20:11.931 --> 00:20:13.034
- Loving it.

483
00:20:13.034 --> 00:20:14.275
You know. I've actually
never been here

484
00:20:14.275 --> 00:20:15.793
until they brought
me down to interview.

485
00:20:15.793 --> 00:20:18.448
and I don't have a lot of
family left in Chicago.

486
00:20:18.448 --> 00:20:21.172
and my mom just moved
to a place on the beach

487
00:20:21.172 --> 00:20:23.310
in Sarasota. Florida.

488
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.862
- Wow.

489
00:20:24.862 --> 00:20:27.827
- Yeah. she's a retired school
superintendent of 20 years.

490
00:20:27.827 --> 00:20:28.793
- Wait. what?

491
00:20:28.793 --> 00:20:29.689
- [Gary] Mm.

492
00:20:29.689 --> 00:20:31.965
- So my mom was an educator too.

493
00:20:31.965 --> 00:20:33.310
Elementary school principal.

494
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.172
- Well there you go.

495
00:20:35.172 --> 00:20:37.137
- Teachers' kids. Crazy.

496
00:20:38.344 --> 00:20:39.827
Well. I'm glad things
are working out so far.

497
00:20:39.827 --> 00:20:41.448
- [Gary] Thank you.

498
00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:44.689
- All right. so. tell me what
you're looking for home-wise.

499
00:20:44.689 --> 00:20:47.827
We've got size. budget.
house versus condo.

500
00:20:47.827 --> 00:20:49.137
Lay it on me.

501
00:20:49.137 --> 00:20:50.965
- Yeah. definitely a house.

502
00:20:50.965 --> 00:20:53.379
something renovated but
big enough to grow into.

503
00:20:53.379 --> 00:20:54.827
maybe a nice yard.

504
00:20:56.034 --> 00:20:59.448
I can definitely see
myself settling down.

505
00:20:59.448 --> 00:21:00.931
Start up a family.

506
00:21:00.931 --> 00:21:03.517
- Let's get to
know what you want.

507
00:21:03.517 --> 00:21:05.034
- Words to live by.

508
00:21:06.586 --> 00:21:09.000
- Well. I definitely have a
few properties I can show you.

509
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.551
- That's wonderful.

510
00:21:10.551 --> 00:21:14.551
As far as price. I would say
Safehouse pays pretty well.

511
00:21:14.551 --> 00:21:16.034
so $700.000 range.

512
00:21:18.034 --> 00:21:20.896
- Well. I will
pull some listings.

513
00:21:20.896 --> 00:21:22.379
But before I move forward.

514
00:21:22.379 --> 00:21:25.413
I'll need to get your
pre-qualification letter.

515
00:21:25.413 --> 00:21:27.413
- Of course. yeah.
Definitely qualified.

516
00:21:27.413 --> 00:21:28.689
- Nice.

517
00:21:28.689 --> 00:21:31.413
Well. I look forward
to receiving it.

518
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.482
- You're really
good at what you do.

519
00:21:34.482 --> 00:21:35.379
[Sarah chuckles]

520
00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:36.896
- Thanks.

521
00:21:36.896 --> 00:21:40.448
- I mean the way you
connect with people.

522
00:21:40.448 --> 00:21:43.068
- And so do you. Gary.

523
00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:45.896
- That's why we
make a great team.

524
00:21:47.068 --> 00:21:49.551
I am sorry how we met though.

525
00:21:49.551 --> 00:21:50.724
- Yeah.

526
00:21:50.724 --> 00:21:52.517
You know. the...

527
00:21:52.517 --> 00:21:55.172
The thought of my son
going through life

528
00:21:55.172 --> 00:21:59.241
possibly without either
of his parents. it just...

529
00:22:02.965 --> 00:22:04.448
- He still has you.

530
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:09.827
- Yeah.

531
00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:11.724
He does.

532
00:22:14.103 --> 00:22:15.655
Well. I hate to rush.

533
00:22:15.655 --> 00:22:17.931
but I have a showing in
30 minutes across town.

534
00:22:17.931 --> 00:22:20.965
so we'll continue this later?

535
00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:22.241
- I look forward to it.

536
00:22:22.241 --> 00:22:23.068
- Okay.

537
00:22:24.965 --> 00:22:28.034
[gentle piano music]

538
00:22:33.793 --> 00:22:36.275
- This place is incredible.

539

00:30:44.965 --> 00:30:47.896
- Like if you and
I were to go out.

719
00:30:49.758 --> 00:30:50.965
- Gary. look...

720
00:30:52.206 --> 00:30:54.137
You know I think
you're a great person.

721
00:30:54.137 --> 00:30:57.413
And you know I
appreciate very much

722
00:30:57.413 --> 00:30:59.172
what you did for me on
the day of the break-in.

723
00:30:59.172 --> 00:31:03.793
but I don't mix my business
life with my personal life.

724
00:31:04.793 --> 00:31:06.000
- I understand.

725
00:31:08.448 --> 00:31:09.793
It's just that...

726
00:31:12.172 --> 00:31:17.137
you and I went through something
together that day. Sarah.

727
00:31:18.344 --> 00:31:19.931
And when I saw you.
I felt a connection.

728
00:31:19.931 --> 00:31:21.586
I feel a connection.

729
00:31:23.172 --> 00:31:25.103
I think you feel one too.

730
00:31:25.103 --> 00:31:26.344
Anyone could have answered
the alarm that day.

731
00:31:26.344 --> 00:31:27.931
but they didn't.

732
00:31:27.931 --> 00:31:28.758
It was me.

733
00:31:30.275 --> 00:31:31.793
- Gary. I-

734
00:31:31.793 --> 00:31:33.310
- Sarah. if we could just put
the real estate stuff aside

735
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:35.793
and just. you know. I would
love to take you to dinner.

736
00:31:35.793 --> 00:31:36.827
I really would. just dinner.

737
00:31:36.827 --> 00:31:39.000
You know. see how it goes.

738
00:31:40.172 --> 00:31:43.068
I think you'd have
really good time.

739
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:45.586
- I'm sorry.

740
00:31:45.586 --> 00:31:46.413
I can't.

741
00:31:49.482 --> 00:31:50.310
- You can.

742
00:31:54.482 --> 00:31:56.137
You just don't want.

743
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.655
Good luck to you. Sarah.

[birds chirping]

745
00:32:16.068 --> 00:32:18.413
- I wonder how Jalen
and Daddy are doing.

746
00:32:18.413 --> 00:32:19.724
Remember when he used
to take us fishing?

747
00:32:19.724 --> 00:32:20.862
- [Sarah] Mm-hm.

748
00:32:20.862 --> 00:32:22.862
- I low key hated that shit.

749
00:32:22.862 --> 00:32:23.931
- Bro. it wasn't that bad.

750
00:32:23.931 --> 00:32:24.896
- Whatever.

751
00:32:26.068 --> 00:32:29.724
Oh. hey. you wanna
go get pizza tonight?

752
00:32:29.724 --> 00:32:30.551
- I can't.

[ominous orchestral music]

754

No. you're a liar. Tell me.

756
00:32:38.551 --> 00:32:40.689
- [Sarah] I'm not a liar.
It's none of your business.

757
00:32:40.689 --> 00:32:42.931
- [Kelci] You better tell me.
or I will make it my business

758
00:32:42.931 --> 00:32:44.241
to get on every last
one of your nerves.

759
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:45.517
[Sarah sighs]

760
00:32:45.517 --> 00:32:47.517
- Remember Frank Cantos?

761
00:32:49.724 --> 00:32:51.517
I graduated with him.

762
00:32:52.482 --> 00:32:53.758
- Fine ass Frank?

763
00:32:53.758 --> 00:32:57.000
- So. I ran into him
at Jalen's school.

764
00:32:58.206 --> 00:33:00.241
and then again at
Jalen's soccer game.

765
00:33:00.241 --> 00:33:02.482
and he invited me
out to join him

766
00:33:02.482 --> 00:33:05.620
and a bunch of friends
for drinks. so I went.

767
00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.172
- And you didn't tell me?

768
00:33:07.172 --> 00:33:09.137
- I was going to.

769
00:33:09.137 --> 00:33:11.413
- So you're going
out with him tonight?

770
00:33:11.413 --> 00:33:12.724
- Yeah.

771
00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:15.103
- He got any cute friends?

772
00:33:15.103 --> 00:33:15.931
- I'll ask.

[Sarah chuckles]

779
00:34:12.034 --> 00:34:13.517
So tell me about your daughter.

780
00:34:13.517 --> 00:34:15.206
- Oh. man. Zoe?

781
00:34:15.206 --> 00:34:17.862
Oh. well she's got
a beautiful laugh.

782
00:34:17.862 --> 00:34:19.551
and she draws me
pictures of unicorns.

783
00:34:19.551 --> 00:34:21.068
And even though she's not
very skilled at soccer.

784
00:34:21.068 --> 00:34:23.862
she tries very hard.
which makes me very happy.

785
00:34:23.862 --> 00:34:25.310
'cause I know she's
strong and she's tough.

786
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:26.137
She cares.

787
00:34:26.137 --> 00:34:26.965
[Sarah chuckles]

788
00:34:26.965 --> 00:34:29.206
- That's so beautiful.

789
00:34:29.206 --> 00:34:31.827
- When Erica left. it was
just me and her for a while.

790
00:34:31.827 --> 00:34:33.310
- Left?

791
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.034
- Yeah. she decided that
my teacher lifestyle

792
00:34:35.034 --> 00:34:36.344
wasn't gonna cut it.

793
00:34:36.344 --> 00:34:37.862
She wanted the hedge
fund lifestyle.

794
00:34:37.862 --> 00:34:41.241
so she moved to LA with an
NFL player. and I kept Zoe.

[Sarah scoffs]

796

She came back last year.
We have joined custody now.

797
00:34:44.172 --> 00:34:45.620
But it was just me
and her for a while.

798
00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.965
It was a tough stretch.

799
00:34:47.965 --> 00:34:49.275
- Can't imagine.

800
00:34:50.586 --> 00:34:53.137
- Well. you had it a lot worse.

801
00:34:55.793 --> 00:34:59.000
- One second. Mark is jogging..

802
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.689

getting a call that he...

This can only be one person.

811
00:35:41.482 --> 00:35:45.103
Yep. we conjured
drew up. It's Zoe.

812
00:35:45.103 --> 00:35:46.758
Hello?

813
00:35:46.758 --> 00:35:47.620
Hey. honey.

814
00:35:48.517 --> 00:35:49.689
Oh no. no. no.

815
00:36:51.172 --> 00:36:52.793
I'm really sorry. I
don't know what happened.

816
00:36:52.793 --> 00:36:54.034
I mean. she was
fine when I left.

817
00:36:54.034 --> 00:36:55.827
and now she's thrown
up like three times.

bucket ready. pops.

897
00:42:08.448 --> 00:42:09.379
- Thanks.

898
00:42:09.379 --> 00:42:11.344
- Did Sarah happen to tell you

899
00:42:11.344 --> 00:42:13.827
that she used to be
my real estate agent?

900
00:42:13.827 --> 00:42:15.655
- No. she did not.

901
00:42:15.655 --> 00:42:17.206
- She didn't?

902
00:42:17.206 --> 00:42:20.793
Frank. I couldn't make up
my damn mind on anything.

903
00:42:21.758 --> 00:42:23.206
I wanted to tell you. though.

904
00:42:23.206 --> 00:42:27.827
I put in a offer today on this
gorgeous place in Midtown.

905
00:42:28.517 --> 00:42:29.344
- Congratulations.

906
00:42:29.344 --> 00:42:31.137
- Thank you.

907
00:42:31.137 --> 00:42:34.862
And when you two walked in. I
thought I owe Sarah a drink.

908
00:42:34.862 --> 00:42:37.000
because she spent so much time

909
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.689
and all those hours
helping me find a place.

910
00:42:38.689 --> 00:42:42.551
and then someone else got
that big commission. you know?

911
00:42:42.551 --> 00:42:44.517
- Yeah. well. that's just
how it goes sometimes.

912
00:42:44.517 --> 00:42:45.620
so it's cool.

913
00:42:46.655 --> 00:42:49.000
- [Gary] I guess so. [chuckles]

914
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.482
- Well. Gary. thank you
again for the drinks.

915
00:42:51.482 --> 00:42:53.103
We really appreciate it.

916
00:42:53.103 --> 00:42:55.482
- You are welcome. Frank.

917
00:42:55.482 --> 00:42:57.206
What do you do?

918
00:42:57.206 --> 00:42:58.517
- I'm a teacher.

919
00:43:00.103 --> 00:43:01.000
- Wow.

920
00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:04.068
- It's a shame you guys don't
get paid what you deserve.

921
00:43:04.068 --> 00:43:04.896
Don't you agree?

922
00:43:04.896 --> 00:43:06.448
[Frank laughs]

923
00:43:06.448 --> 00:43:08.413
- Yeah. well. I definitely
don't do it for the money.

924
00:43:08.413 --> 00:43:09.862
[Gary snaps fingers]

925
00:43:09.862 --> 00:43:11.724
- That right there.

926
00:43:11.724 --> 00:43:12.896
I need to be more like that.

927
00:43:12.896 --> 00:43:14.344
[Sarah chuckles]

928
00:43:14.344 --> 00:43:15.896
[Gary and Sarah chuckling]

929
00:43:15.896 --> 00:43:16.724
- Great.

930
00:43:18.758 --> 00:43:21.000
- Well. Gary. we're about
to dive into our food.

931
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.103
but maybe we'll see
you around town.

932
00:43:23.103 --> 00:43:24.413
- Yeah.

933
00:43:24.413 --> 00:43:25.931
- Absolutely. And
sorry to intrude.

934
00:43:25.931 --> 00:43:28.241
Next time. dinner
is on me though.

935
00:43:28.241 --> 00:43:29.034
- Sure.

936
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.206
- You guys have a great night.

937
00:43:33.206 --> 00:43:34.034
Nice to meet you. Frank.

938
00:43:34.034 --> 00:43:35.758
- You too. Same here.

939
00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:39.862
Yeah. he's a little intense.

940
00:43:39.862 --> 00:43:42.931
- A little? [laughs]

941
00:43:52.344 --> 00:43:53.931
- Excuse me. can we
have the check please?

942
00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:55.448
- Oh. no need. sir.

943
00:43:55.448 --> 00:43:57.896
The gentleman that bought your
drinks earlier paid for it.

944
00:43:57.896 --> 00:43:58.827
- Are you sure?

945
00:43:58.827 --> 00:44:01.379
- Very. He left a nice tip too.

946
00:44:05.137 --> 00:44:06.586
- [Sarah] That
was a lot of wine.

947
00:44:06.586 --> 00:44:07.620
- [Frank] Oh. yes. it was.

948
00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:08.620
- Yeah.

949
00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:10.448
But. hey. thank you so much.

950
00:44:10.448 --> 00:44:12.241
This was a lot of fun.

951
00:44:13.482 --> 00:44:15.172
[Frank sighs]

952
00:44:15.172 --> 00:44:16.241
- You know. I've been wanting
to hang out with you like this

953
00:44:16.241 --> 00:44:18.413
since ninth grade.

954
00:44:18.413 --> 00:44:19.827
- Yeah right.

955
00:44:19.827 --> 00:44:21.827
You didn't even know
me in the ninth grade.

956
00:44:21.827 --> 00:44:24.241
- Oh. I knew who you were.

957
00:44:24.241 --> 00:44:26.793
You were this pretty...

958
00:44:26.793 --> 00:44:27.620
smart...

959
00:44:29.344 --> 00:44:30.413
quiet girl...

960
00:44:31.793 --> 00:44:34.275
who was secretly a lot of fun.

961
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.896
- I think you have me confused.

962
00:44:39.758 --> 00:44:40.586
- No.

963
00:44:41.482 --> 00:44:43.310
No confusion here.

964
00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:46.379
[gentle piano music]

965
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.758
[anxious instrumental music]

966
00:45:03.137 --> 00:45:04.896
[both chuckling]

967
00:45:04.896 --> 00:45:07.448
- I'll see you later?

968
00:45:07.448 --> 00:45:08.482
- Yes. ma'am.

969
00:45:13.206 --> 00:45:14.448
[both laughing]

970
00:45:14.448 --> 00:45:15.862
- Yeah. I got it.

971
00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:23.862
[footsteps approaching]

972
00:45:26.206 --> 00:45:28.517
- [Sarah's Mom] I haven't
seen you glowing like this

973
00:45:28.517 --> 00:45:29.793
in a long time.

974
00:45:31.034 --> 00:45:32.206
- Mom.

975
00:45:32.206 --> 00:45:34.034
- Grinning like a teenager.

976
00:45:34.034 --> 00:45:36.413
[Sarah laughs]

977
00:45:36.413 --> 00:45:38.551
He was a nice boy
in high school.

978
00:45:38.551 --> 00:45:40.034
- He still is.

979
00:45:40.034 --> 00:45:40.965
- Good.

980
00:45:40.965 --> 00:45:43.137
You deserve to be happy.

981
00:45:43.137 --> 00:45:46.482
[emotional instrumental music]

982
00:45:46.482 --> 00:45:48.310
- No. I don't.

983
00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:49.517
- What's wrong?

984
00:45:50.862 --> 00:45:51.965
[Sarah sighs]

985
00:45:51.965 --> 00:45:53.793
- The day Mark died...

986
00:45:55.379 --> 00:45:56.655
we had a fight.

987
00:45:58.896 --> 00:46:02.758
He said he was gonna go
for a run to cool off.

988
00:46:03.758 --> 00:46:06.241
And so my last words to him...

989
00:46:07.379 --> 00:46:09.310
were. "You can go for a run

990
00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.551
and never come back
for all I care."

991
00:46:12.551 --> 00:46:16.758
- All couples say things
in the heat of the moment.

992
00:46:16.758 --> 00:46:18.758
It's not your fault.

993
00:46:18.758 --> 00:46:19.586
- Really?

994
00:46:20.931 --> 00:46:24.241
'Cause he was dead
10 minutes later...

995
00:46:24.241 --> 00:46:25.931
running away from me.

996
00:46:27.413 --> 00:46:29.758
- He had a heart issue. It
could have happened anytime.

997
00:46:29.758 --> 00:46:32.206
- Yeah. but it didn't.

998
00:46:32.206 --> 00:46:35.241
- Baby. you have to
forgive yourself.

999
00:46:36.724 --> 00:46:38.551
It's been over a year.

1000
00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:41.896
You deserve a life.

1001
00:46:43.103 --> 00:46:48.068
[tense instrumental music]
[typing]

1002
00:46:55.689 --> 00:46:58.862
[children chattering]

1003
00:46:59.931 --> 00:47:02.655
[Gary clapping]

1004
00:47:05.482 --> 00:47:07.482
- You boys are gonna be pros.

1005
00:47:07.482 --> 00:47:09.034
You know how I know?

1006
00:47:09.034 --> 00:47:10.482
Used to play for Barcelona.

1007
00:47:10.482 --> 00:47:11.689
- You know Messi?

1008
00:47:11.689 --> 00:47:13.310
- Do I know Messi?

1009
00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.482
He was my roommate.

1010
00:47:14.482 --> 00:47:16.137
- Wow! Can you
show us some stuff?

1011
00:47:16.137 --> 00:47:17.655
- You know. I could.

1012
00:47:17.655 --> 00:47:19.448
but I hurt my knee real
bad during the World Cup.

1013
00:47:19.448 --> 00:47:21.000
- Oh.

1014
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.862
- But what I can do. we
can go over the big field.

1015
00:47:22.862 --> 00:47:24.000
I can take a video
of you guys shooting

1016
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.448
and send it to some
coaches I know.

1017
00:47:25.448 --> 00:47:26.310
[Jalen gasps]

1018
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.137
- Really?

1019
00:47:27.137 --> 00:47:27.965
- Absolutely.

1020
00:47:27.965 --> 00:47:29.172
- Cool!

1021
00:47:29.172 --> 00:47:30.689
Just let me tell my mom
where to pick us up.

1022
00:47:30.689 --> 00:47:32.482
- [Gary] Sounds good.

1023
00:47:34.137 --> 00:47:36.793
[phone ringing]

1024
00:47:38.172 --> 00:47:41.482
- Hey. sweetie. What's going on?

1025
00:47:41.482 --> 00:47:42.413
Wait. what?

1026
00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.344
No. Kim's supposed to
be picking you up today.

1027
00:47:45.344 --> 00:47:47.000
It says it on my calendar.

1028
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.586
Wait. hold on baby.

1029
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:52.965
[Sarah gasps]

1030
00:47:52.965 --> 00:47:54.448
Okay. I'm sorry.

1031
00:47:54.448 --> 00:47:56.793
I don't know what happened.
but I'm on my way. okay?

1032
00:47:56.793 --> 00:47:58.689
No. don't go to the big field.

1033
00:47:58.689 --> 00:48:01.551
Stay on your field.
I'm on my way.

1034
00:48:03.241 --> 00:48:04.413
- Great.

1035
00:48:04.413 --> 00:48:05.758
Remember. it's
all about control.

1036
00:48:05.758 --> 00:48:09.034
That's all right.
That's all right.

1037
00:48:09.034 --> 00:48:10.896
Keep it up. Here we go.

1038
00:48:13.551 --> 00:48:15.000
Perfect.

1039
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.551
All right. just keep
practicing just like that.

1040
00:48:21.034 --> 00:48:23.896
All right. Jalen.
great meeting you boys.

1041
00:48:23.896 --> 00:48:25.758
You keep practicing
what I showed you. okay?

1042
00:48:25.758 --> 00:48:26.586
- [Jalen] Thanks!

1043
00:48:26.586 --> 00:48:28.034
- See you soon.

1044
00:48:28.034 --> 00:48:31.724
[anxious instrumental music]

1045
00:48:41.586 --> 00:48:44.068
[Trina sighs]

1046
00:48:47.586 --> 00:48:49.103
- Hey!

1047
00:48:49.103 --> 00:48:52.862
- You are not gonna believe who
I bumped into the other day.

1048
00:48:52.862 --> 00:48:55.206
The pretty lady
from the commercial!

1049
00:48:55.206 --> 00:48:57.758
Woo. she was with
fine ass Frank!

1050
00:48:57.758 --> 00:49:00.172
I was like. I used to play ball
with his sister or whatever.

1051
00:49:00.172 --> 00:49:02.758
but he had like a little
beard. he was tall now.

1052
00:49:02.758 --> 00:49:04.241
and they looked like
a cute little couple.

1053
00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:05.275
I was like...

1054
00:49:08.655 --> 00:49:11.620
What'd you eat for
lunch? [scoffs]

1055
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.103
- Yeah.
- Yay. good job!

1056
00:49:14.103 --> 00:49:15.103
You did so good today.

1057
00:49:15.103 --> 00:49:16.000
I'm so proud of you.

1058
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.275
- What a nice surprise this is.

1059
00:49:17.275 --> 00:49:19.482
[tense instrumental music]

1060
00:49:19.482 --> 00:49:20.517
- Gary.

1061
00:49:20.517 --> 00:49:22.586
- Wait. is this your son?

1062
00:49:24.655 --> 00:49:25.965
- Yeah. he sure is.

1063
00:49:25.965 --> 00:49:29.275
- Mom. this is the guy
who played with Messi!

1064
00:49:29.275 --> 00:49:30.275
- Wait. what?

1065
00:49:31.517 --> 00:49:33.000
- Yeah. I was jogging in
the park the other day.

1066
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.655
and I saw this little man and
his friend playing soccer.

1067
00:49:34.655 --> 00:49:36.827
and I decided to
show him some stuff.

1068
00:49:36.827 --> 00:49:39.793
That's crazy. I didn't know
he was your son though.

1069
00:49:39.793 --> 00:49:41.793
Looks like you won the
championship today. All right!

1070
00:49:41.793 --> 00:49:43.000
- Sure did.

1071
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.344
- Okay. Jalen. honey. go
get in the car please.

1072
00:49:45.344 --> 00:49:47.310
- I wanna talk to Gary
about when he played pro.

1073
00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:48.931
- He didn't.

he's following me.

1254
01:02:07.793 --> 01:02:09.620
Yo daddy wasn't no cop.

1255
01:02:11.241 --> 01:02:13.000
He was a damn inmate.

1256
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:14.827
Oh.

1257
01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:16.965
Oh. hell no.

Where are you?

1260
01:02:23.482 --> 01:02:24.965
I've been calling.
I've been texting.

1261
01:02:24.965 --> 01:02:27.379
You're not responding.

1262
01:02:27.379 --> 01:02:28.896

1268
01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:06.965
Donald. how long have
we known each other?

1269
01:03:06.965 --> 01:03:09.275
- Since the third grade when
you tried to be my girlfriend?

1270
01:03:09.275 --> 01:03:11.758
- Well. I had very bad
taste in men back then.

1271
01:03:11.758 --> 01:03:12.758
- Obviously.

1272
01:03:14.931 --> 01:03:16.482
- Who told you about this job.

1273
01:03:16.482 --> 01:03:19.896
and walked your very
thin resume into HR?

1274
01:03:21.862 --> 01:03:23.241
- You did. Trina.

1275
01:03:23.241 --> 01:03:24.103
You did.

1276
01:03:24.103 --> 01:03:25.310
- Yes. I did.

1277
01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:26.586
And have I ever asked
you for anything?

1278
01:03:26.586 --> 01:03:27.793
- You had me run
a background check

1279
01:03:27.793 --> 01:03:28.758
on that guy who asked
you outta a while back.

1280
01:03:28.758 --> 01:03:31.034
- And ain't you glad I did?

1281
01:03:31.034 --> 01:03:33.103
That guy was shady. Remember?

1282
01:03:33.103 --> 01:03:34.620
- Never date a man named Kash.

1283
01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.689

my finger on it.

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.310
but his shit ain't straight.

1290
01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:52.758

be the assistant-

1291

01:04:06.206 --> 01:04:08.758
- He told me his dad was a cop.

1298
01:04:08.758 --> 01:04:10.689
Lies. 'cause I looked it up.

1299
01:04:10.689 --> 01:04:13.655
His daddy had been in and outta
jail for all kinds of stuff.

1301

Oh. and the other
day I saw his phone.

1302
01:04:19.827 --> 01:04:22.379
This motherfucker had a
tracking app on his phone.

1303
01:04:22.379 --> 01:04:23.206
Who has that?

Who. huh? Who?

1305

He either a spy or a psycho.

1306
01:04:28.862 --> 01:04:31.000

some spyin' on your own.

1307
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.310

There's a difference.

1308
01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:38.689
Look. I need you to see what
he been doing on company time.

1309

1310
01:04:39.965 --> 01:04:41.517
when they fire me
for doing this?

1311
01:04:41.517 --> 01:04:43.344

you wrote all the damn codes?

but it's just so scary.

somebody outside my door.

gone off. okay?

01:06:37.172 --> 01:06:38.931
And don't forget. your grandma's
gonna pick you up today

to end of your driveway.

- Oh.
- Yeah.

1366

So what I'll do is I'll email
you the link of the footage.

1367
01:08:01.103 --> 01:08:03.896
and maybe we'll show
'em to the police.
