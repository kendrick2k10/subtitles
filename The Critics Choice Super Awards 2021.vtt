I hear you ask.

587
00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:23.936
Well. let me explain.

588
00:23:23.936 --> 00:23:26.205
If this were science fiction.
I would be playing

589
00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:27.740
the character
who is speaking to you

590
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.275
through this laptop
because I'm hiding out

591
00:23:29.275 --> 00:23:32.077
from a group
of marauding aliens.

592
00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:34.480
That would be science fiction.

593
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.749
But if this
were fantasy. however.

594
00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:38.550
I would be talking to you
through this laptop

595
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.754
because I would be playing
a all-powerful wizard

596
00:23:41.754 --> 00:23:44.757
who just likes
to work from home.

597
00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:47.626
That would be fantasy.

598
00:23:47.626 --> 00:23:49.628
But as this is
just lame. old reality.

599
00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:52.164
the fact of the matter is
I am talking to you

600
00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:55.467
through this laptop because
I just love wearing sweatpants.

601
00:23:56.902 --> 00:23:59.104
Love sweatpants.

602
00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:00.372
