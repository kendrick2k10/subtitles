00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.288
{\an8}You can't come back to me
with that.

15
00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:21.664
{\an8}We've already been there.

16
00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:23.166
{\an8}Let's take this up a notch.

17
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.417
{\an8}How's it going?

18
00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.252
{\an8}- I'm crushing it.
- I'm on it.

19
00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.128
{\an8}No.

20
00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:27.921
{\an8}No. no. no.

21
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.089
{\an8}- Hey Tim.
- Birdie.

22
00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.465
{\an8}- Paula.
- How'd the Lancaster call go?

23
00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:31.841
{\an8}It actually got pushed
‘til tomorrow.

24
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.760
{\an8}You let me know if you need
any help with that.

25
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.095
{\an8}We're all rooting for you.

26
00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.180
{\an8}I think I got it covered
but I'll let you know.

27
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.640
{\an8}You got everything there. Paula?

28
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.225
{\an8}Always do.

29
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:45.105
{\an8}Just a heads up. the Lancaster
call got pushed ‘til tomorrow.

30
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.731
{\an8}Oh. They're stalling.

31
00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.733
{\an8}Which means you've got them
right where you want them.

32
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:49.734
{\an8}I know.

33
00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:50.902
{\an8}I can taste it.

34
00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.825
{\an8}Birdie. bird.

35
00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:57.992
{\an8}I'm outta here.

36
00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.411
{\an8}Gotta get that step count up.

37
00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:02.288
{\an8}Oh. you're so good.
You ready for tomorrow?

38
00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.124
{\an8}Me? I was born ready.

39
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.334
{\an8}I'll tell you what. tomorrow
I will get the coffee.

40
00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:07.419
{\an8}Yeah?

41
00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:08.169
{\an8}Deal.

42
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.713
{\an8}- The ushe?
- The ushe.

43
00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:10.630
{\an8}You know me.

44
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.131
{\an8}Of course I do.

45
00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:19.639
{\an8}Hey babe!

46
00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.363
Okay.

47
00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:38.908
Deal me in. boys.

48
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.328
Good evening.

49
00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.580
I'm Trisha Murata and tonight
authorities believe

50
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.709
a 30-year-mystery has finally
come to an end.

51
00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.671
Just hours ago at this
construction site behind me.

52
00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:55.175
workers discovered the body
of famed Boston crime boss

53
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.510
Orleans “Lean” McGuiness.

54
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.930
McGuiness had been on the top
of the FBI's most wanted list

55
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.557
for over two decades.

56
00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.017
Well dumping him
at a construction site

57
00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.353
has mob written all over it.

58
00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:09.606
Seems kinda cliché.
Don't you think?

59
00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.066
This is real life.

60
00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.901
Not an article in
<i>The New Yorker</i>.

61
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.861
Oh. So you can read?

62
00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.203
Careful there. glasses.

63
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:26.081
Most of us swim in these waters
on a regular basis.

64
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.708
You haven't even gotten
your feet wet.

65
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.085
Alright.

66
00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.253
Are we gonna finish class
or argue about the news?

67
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.930
Don't worry about him.

68
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.059
The ability to use various
equipment and technologies

69
00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.019
and a thorough knowledge
of the law

70
00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.315
are some of the key skills
a private investigator needs.

71
00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:56.611
Now. who can tell me what
sub rosa means?

72
00:03:58.947 --> 00:03:59.989
Yes.

73
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:01.991
Um. it's Latin for...

74
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.663
It's Latin for...

75
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.582
For under the rose.
It's a...

76
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:11.751
It's a term that
investigators use

77
00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:12.961
when they wanna do something
in secret.

78
00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.462
Alright.

79
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.757
This week's assignment.
it's gonna be a little more fun.

80
00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:18.925
Surveillance.

81
00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.427
Yeah.

82
00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.846
I need all of you to surveil
someone from your life.

83
00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.347
A few rules.

84
00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:25.640
Don't get caught.

85
00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:28.560
Don't follow your wife.

86
00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:30.895
Don't follow your boss.

87
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.898
And definitely don't follow
your ex-wife.

88
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.945
I take it you haven't
told her yet.

89
00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.447
I'm working on it.

90
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.949
So that's a no.

91
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.409
Yeah. well...

92
00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.912
with Birdie. it's all about
finding the right time.

93
00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.207
What are you afraid of?

94
00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.336
Inflation. Carcinogens.
Murder hornets.

95
00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:56.713
Teenagers on skateboards.
Pretty much everything.

96
00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.758
But the thing that I'm afraid of
the most...

97
00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:02.594
is that look of disappointment
on my wife's face.

98
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.223
You could be an incredible
private investigator.

99
00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.559
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.479
And I'd hate to see all that
potential go to the wayside

101
00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.191
because you were afraid of
disappointing your wife.

102
00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:17.150
I know.

103
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.193
You have to tell her.

104
00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:19.736
I will.

105
00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:20.445
Soon.

106
00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.238
Soon is upon us.

107
00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:23.490
Huh?

108
00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.533
Soon.

109
00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:26.951
See ya.

110
00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:37.379
Oh. Oh. so that's how
it's gonna be.

111
00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.048
I don't think you got it
Lizard King 784.

112
00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.216
You're bluffing.

113
00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.021
Hey.

114
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.773
Hey babe.

115
00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:57.899
How was class?

116
00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.485
Oh. you know. fascinating.

117
00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.154
We're learning all
about bankruptcy.

118
00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.657
Oh. So you're on chapter
11 then.

119
00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:08.535
Uh. no. Actually. we're
on chapter 4 but...

120
00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.037
I see what you did there.

121
00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.789
Mmhmm. Mmhmm.

122
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.006
Yes! Eat it.

123
00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:22.590
Eat what now?

124
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.052
Oh. I. um... got you
some new granola.

125
00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.387
- Nice!
- Yeah.

126
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.847
The one I like
with the pistachios?

127
00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.682
Yeah. Uh huh.

128
00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:37.022
Did you get up
to anything fun tonight?

129
00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.648
Oh. you know.

130
00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:43.611
Just. um... a couple of briefs
and. uh. getting my Sudoku on.

131
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:44.654
Uh huh.

132
00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.449
Yeah. Just a wild
and crazy night.

133
00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:53.204
Actually. um...
you know there's something

134
00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:56.332
I kinda wanted to talk
to you about.

135
00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.710
Oh. Okay.

136
00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:01.713
What is it?

137
00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:03.923
I...

138
00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:09.929
Uh... read that. um...
the article that you sent me.

139
00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.473
And you know what?
I think you're right.

140
00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:13.683
I think I should be taking
a daily probiotic.

141
00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:15.226
You read the article
I sent you?

142
00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.479
Thank you.

143
00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:19.064
I know it's not everyone's
favorite topic.

144
00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.190
Well...

145
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.107
But if we're gonna grow
old together

146
00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:22.650
we cannot ignore our gut health.

147
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.278
I mean. the balance of good
and bad bacteria are crucial.

148
00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.363
It's crucial.

149
00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:27.864
Crucial.

150
00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.247
Yeah.

151
00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:47.634
This initial offer
is unacceptable.
is just unacceptable.

152
00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:48.635
- Morning.
- Morning.

153
00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.929
- Hey! Whoa. whoa. whoa.
- Oh.

154
00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:54.432
I made you a little breakfast.
Your favorite.

155
00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:57.310
Um. I was hoping we could
have a chat.

156
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.770
This is so amazing

157
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.355
but I actually have the
Lancaster call this morning.

158
00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.356
Can I take a rain check?

159
00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:02.816
A rain check.

160
00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:03.817
Uh... sure.

161
00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:04.818
Great.

162
00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:07.445
Uh. well. But how about...
a latte?

163
00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:08.947
I love this little heart.

164
00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:10.323
It's a little heart.

165
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.700
Oh. you know what?

166
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.869
Kyle... Kyle was grabbing
coffees on his way in.

167
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:16.579
But I feel so bad that you
went through all this trouble.

168
00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.164
I mean. I...

169
00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.332
I'm gonna take a little sip.
I'm gonna take a little sip.

170
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.835
That's okay.

171
00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:22.836
- I'm totally fine with that.
- Wait. I have to take this.

172
00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.671
Kyle! I was just talking
about you.

173
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.840
You ready to crush it?
I'll see you tonight.

174
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.091
Hey...

175
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.676
You literally
finished my sentence.

176
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.094
that is exactly what
I was thinking.

177
00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:33.805
We are so on the same page.

178
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.146
Just make something up ‘cause
I don't wanna talk to him now.

179
00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:43.356
Yo! Yo. the bird looking sharp.

180
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.733
You ready for this?

181
00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.651
Breaking necks
and cashing checks.

182
00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.069
Thank you very much.

183
00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:53.700
Mmm! Cinnamon.
Living on the edge.

184
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.076
Game time.

185
00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.749
The case
of famed Boston crime boss

186
00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:03.710
Orleans McGuiness continues
to unfold.

187
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.961
Police are now reporting

188
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:08.256
that this is an active
homicide investigation.

189
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.550
And that's the news
for this hour.

190
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.637
Coming up. a rare B-side from
the late Danny “Teardrops” Page.

191
00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.848
Paid in full.

192
00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.268
Okay. Gambot 200.

193
00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:25.607
It is time for you to go
to your forever home.

194
00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.945
You know. I think you're gonna
like Cincinnati.

195
00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.823
Terrible chili but the people
are great.

196
00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:38.745
Godspeed old friend.

197
00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:46.920
Oh Kyle. your coffee's so great.
Is that cardamom in there?

198
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.963
Does everything you touch
smell like unicorns?

199
00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.320
Our position
from the beginning

200
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.156
was to have this resolved
in a reasonable fashion.

201
00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.324
We understand that.

202
00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:18.118
We believe 3.5 is
more than reasonable.

203
00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.661
You know three
million was our ceiling.

204
00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:20.745
No. Up. up.

205
00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:22.580
Now you have a new ceiling.

206
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.249
Our
client does not think
anything over three million

207
00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:26.001
is in their best interest.

208
00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:28.795
That's fine.

209
00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:32.674
We can always see
what a jury thinks.

210
00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:36.177
Fine.
We'll make 3.5 work.

211
00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:38.722
Great. We'll send over
the paperwork this afternoon.

212
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.350
Dream team strikes again.
Huh. huh?

213
00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:46.229
Yes!

214
00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:47.355
Where'd we land?

215
00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.481
3.5.

216
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.482
And on the first round.

217
00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.608
Yes.

218
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.028
But didn't they start at three?

219
00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.614
Paula. can you get the
champagne from my fridge?

220
00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:58.825
This calls for a celebration.

221
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.453
Thank you so much. Tim.

222
00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:03.079
These paralegals.

223
00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:04.414
They file two forms. they think
they're Erin Brockovich.

224
00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:07.000
Ms. Case?

225
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.002
Ms. Perez would like to see you
in her office in five minutes.

226
00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.587
Well. I guess. good news
travels fast.

227
00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:11.921
As it should.
She's gonna love this.

228
00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:13.465
This is how you make partner.

229
00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:14.632
I'm grabbing
the expensive stuff.

230
00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:15.592
Uh huh.

231
00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:18.678
- Well done.
- Thank you. Tim.

232
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.096
That's how you do it.

233
00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:22.682
Thank you Leslie.

234
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:23.933
Teamwork. right?

235
00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:25.810
Teamwork makes the dream work.

236
00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:28.855
We did it.

237
00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.815
Shut the door.

238
00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:37.072
What was that?

239
00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:39.199
This is not how
you make partner.

240
00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.534
We got them half a million
dollars over their ceiling.

241
00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.412
$3.5 million is a disgrace.

242
00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.872
3.5 is fair.

243
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.875
We are not in the business
of fair.

244
00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:50.210
We are in the business
of extracting

245
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.672
everything we can
until there is nothing left.

246
00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:54.673
Kyle and I thought that this...

247
00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:55.882
Listen...

248
00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:58.385
I like Kyle.

249
00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:01.680
He's a good worker bee.

250
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.015
But making partner
isn't in his future.

251
00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:06.351
It is in yours so long
as you pull it together

252
00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.144
and start acting like a killer.

253
00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.270
But Mom...

254
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.982
I am not your mom
when we're at work.

255
00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:17.320
I am your boss.
And I need you to step up.

256
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.571
Understood?

257
00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:19.989
Understood.

258
00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:47.517
Krshnit?

259
00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.937
Oh... crushing it.

260
00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:01.656
11:27 AM.

261
00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:06.286
Target said vehicle identified.

262
00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.954
Brotastic.

263
00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.054
Hey babe.

264
00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:25.180
Hey.

265
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.307
How did the. uh...
how did the call go?

266
00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:28.558
Fine.

267
00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:29.809
Was your mom pleased?

268
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:33.646
My boss wasn't exactly
thrilled. no.

269
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.607
What's new?

270
00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:41.321
Um... hey. uh... so. uh...
I'm thinking about. you know.

271
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:45.367
going with some of the guys
to happy hour tonight.

272
00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:46.618
Um...

273
00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.495
Hey. I'm out.
I'll see you tomorrow.

274
00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:49.996
Okay. Those are gross.

275
00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.581
Uh. no. I'm good.

276
00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:54.626
Okay. Well. don't wait up.

277
00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:56.252
You know how hard CPAs
like to party.

278
00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:57.212
Mmhmm.

279
00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:58.922
Okay. Bye.

280
00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:42.632
Dry cleaning. 5:10 PM.

281
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.824
I'm Kyle.

282
00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:10.535
I like to do five K's
just for fun.

283
00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:31.097
Goodnight. Tim.

284
00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.849
Oh. Birdie. Good night.

285
00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.559
I didn't think anybody
was still here.

286
00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:36.269
You're taking off soon?

287
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:37.562
Tonight feels like one of
those nights

288
00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:38.605
I'm never gonna leave.

289
00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:39.981
Ugh. I hear you.

290
00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:43.610
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

291
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.197
Hey. Today was still a win.

292
00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:48.531
I know Eleonore can be tough

293
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:51.493
but you did right
by your client today.

294
00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:52.952
That's the best we can do.

295
00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.455
I don't know. Sometimes
I just question it all.

296
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.123
We all do.

297
00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.709
You just gotta live
to fight another day.

298
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:03.129
Thanks Tim.
that means a lot.

299
00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.923
Get outta here. Good night.

300
00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:12.347
This is Tim speaking.

301
00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.647
A new suit.

302
00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.148
Fancy boy.

303
00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:27.696
My name's Kyle.

304
00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:29.823
I don't need to wear
a seat belt.

305
00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:51.219
I'm Kyle.
I work 18 hours a day.

306
00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:08.403
Three... Five... ugh.

307
00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:29.424
What the?

308
00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:30.592
Come on.

309
00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:32.427
Ugh!

310
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.145
<i>I|m Kyle. I run out of
buildings at full speed.</i>

311
00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:45.565
Guess I'm going in.

312
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:52.447
Hello?

313
00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.452
Hello?

314
00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:08.505
Barf.

315
00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.385
What's that all about?

316
00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:28.650
Divorce?

317
00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.535
Hello?

318
00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:43.415
Somebody here?

319
00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:01.683
Tim?

320
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.818
Oh no! Oh no!!

321
00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:12.694
Freeze!

322
00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:15.864
Let me see your hands.

323
00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:17.365
It's not what you think.

324
00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.076
How do you know what I think?

325
00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:22.078
Yeah.

326
00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:26.249
Eww.

327
00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:36.968
Ah.

328
00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:40.430
Your blood pressure's
a little high.

329
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.931
You been under
any stress lately?

330
00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:46.102
Slightly more than usual. yeah.

331
00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.742
Mr. Case... let me
get this straight.

332
00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:03.244
You followed a Mr. Henicker. Kyle.

333
00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:07.248
back to the office because
you were "doing homework"

334
00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:11.086
for your "private
investigation class"

335
00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:14.589
‘cause he bought
your wife "coffee".

336
00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:16.007
Did I miss anything?

337
00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:18.218
I don't appreciate your liberal
use of air quotes

338
00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:22.639
but aside from that.
it's correct. yeah.

339
00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:23.848
Alden?

340
00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:25.892
Oh.

341
00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:27.060
Are you okay?

342
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.061
Yeah.

343
00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:30.522
Is that Tim?

344
00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:31.439
Yeah.

345
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.443
Wait. what are you doing here?

346
00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:37.445
Err... I...

347
00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.248
Say something.

348
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:53.712
A few hours ago Tim was giving
me some really kind advice

349
00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:58.174
and then I got in my car
and I drove home

350
00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:01.511
thinking that my husband
was out networking

351
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.013
with other aspiring accountants

352
00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:05.306
because that's what
he told me he was doing.

353
00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:06.266
Yeah.

354
00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.893
And now Tim is dead

355
00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:14.149
and my husband has been lying
to me for four months.

356
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:16.151
Four months about where
he spends his nights.

357
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:18.820
I... I don't... I don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

358
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.156
I'm so sorry that you had
to find out this way.

359
00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:23.742
I... I was... I was trying
to tell you this morning

360
00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:25.744
and then you...
you rushed out.

361
00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:28.329
To work. Alden!
I had to get to work.

362
00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:29.456
That's not fair.

363
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.625
You're right.
You're right.

364
00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.169
I thought we agreed.

365
00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:36.004
I thought we agreed that
accounting was stable

366
00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:37.964
and consistent which is
what we need for you

367
00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:40.091
after your whole crypto
currency debacle.

368
00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:41.801
You promised that
you would play it safe.

369
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:43.970
Okay. All of the blogs said
that crypto mining

370
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.847
was a solid investment.

371
00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:48.016
But we are still paying it off. Alden.

372
00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:50.185
You promised!
You promised!

373
00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:51.353
I know.

374
00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:52.354
That you would find
something reliable.

375
00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:53.980
I know.

376
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:59.110
And... and I tried accounting.
I just couldn't do it.

377
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.445
And then across the hall

378
00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:03.114
they had this Intro to Private Investigation.

379
00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:06.951
So I went over and. I don't
know. something clicked.

380
00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:12.832
Accounting is just not my thing.

381
00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:14.209
It's just not your thing?

382
00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:16.836
Alden. this isn't a college
job fair.

383
00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:17.962
Okay.

384
00:22:20.715 --> 00:22:23.134
I really don't wanna be the wife
that nags you all the time.

385
00:22:23.134 --> 00:22:24.135
I don't.

386
00:22:25.053 --> 00:22:27.055
I love you but I just...

387
00:22:28.598 --> 00:22:31.059
you keep making promises

388
00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:35.063
and then you break them.

389
00:22:41.611 --> 00:22:42.946
Okay. Uh...

390
00:22:45.782 --> 00:22:46.741
Going good.
There we go.

391
00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:49.077
Oh. Okay.
No. No. no. no.

392
00:22:49.077 --> 00:22:51.329
No. No. no. no.
No. No.

393
00:22:51.329 --> 00:22:53.623
Off. Off. Off.

394
00:22:53.623 --> 00:22:55.417
Oh boy.
Okay. Come on. come on.

395
00:22:55.417 --> 00:22:56.751
Off. Off. Okay. Okay.

396
00:22:56.751 --> 00:22:58.420
- Hey. Hey.
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

397
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.422
No. no. no. I know. I know.
I know. I got it.

398
00:23:00.422 --> 00:23:01.715
You're gonna burn yourself.
You're gonna burn yourself.

399
00:23:06.261 --> 00:23:07.345
I had it.

400
00:23:12.058 --> 00:23:16.688
Sorry.
I know how well you knew Tim.

401
00:23:18.356 --> 00:23:20.567
I'm not sure I know anyone
well these days.

402
00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:28.783
Any. uh... any more updates?

403
00:23:28.783 --> 00:23:30.618
Apparently suicide.

404
00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:32.328
Hmm.

405
00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:33.830
So tragic.

406
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.415
It really is.

407
00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:36.332
It's just...

408
00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:39.669
well. I mean. it doesn't explain
why Kyle ran away

409
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.796
before the cops came.

410
00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:43.506
You know?

411
00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:45.508
Innocent people don't run.

412
00:23:56.853 --> 00:23:57.812
How are you doing?

413
00:23:57.812 --> 00:23:59.439
Still processing.

414
00:23:59.439 --> 00:24:01.107
I know this is tough

415
00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:03.443
but we need to think about
the big picture here.

416
00:24:03.443 --> 00:24:06.279
We need to assure our clients.
our future clients

417
00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:08.865
and our employees that
everything is under control.

418
00:24:08.865 --> 00:24:10.408
Yeah. that makes sense.

419
00:24:10.408 --> 00:24:12.994
But we're not expected to do
anything today. right?

420
00:24:12.994 --> 00:24:14.954
Well. people will be
looking for us

421
00:24:14.954 --> 00:24:16.664
to guide them through this.

422
00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:20.001
Tim wasn't just a partner.
he was a real leader.

423
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:21.836
and now someone's gotta
fill that void.

424
00:24:21.836 --> 00:24:23.546
I need it to be you.

425
00:24:23.546 --> 00:24:24.839
Okay. I can do that.

426
00:24:24.839 --> 00:24:27.258
Good. Now...

427
00:24:27.258 --> 00:24:29.052
as your mother asking...

428
00:24:30.679 --> 00:24:32.430
how are you and Alden?

429
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.057
I don't know. Mom.

430
00:24:35.225 --> 00:24:37.519
I mean. the jealousy
with Kyle was one thing.

431
00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:41.356
But this lying about taking
a PI class

432
00:24:41.356 --> 00:24:44.150
has just taken things
to a whole other level.

433
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:48.738
It's... I don't even know
who my own husband is anymore.

434
00:24:48.738 --> 00:24:50.657
I thought you'd be relieved.

435
00:24:50.657 --> 00:24:52.617
Usually when a husband lies
about where he is

436
00:24:52.617 --> 00:24:56.037
it's because he's with another
woman or man.

437
00:24:56.037 --> 00:24:57.247
For better or worse.

438
00:24:57.247 --> 00:24:59.290
your husband lied
about night school.

439
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.377
So what. he's just gonna become
a private investigator now?

440
00:25:02.377 --> 00:25:06.047
Let me ask you this.
has he seemed happier lately?

441
00:25:06.047 --> 00:25:07.590
I don't know.

442
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.384
Have you asked?

443
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.513
A couple of us were thinking
about going out

444
00:25:13.513 --> 00:25:16.057
for drinks tonight
in honor of Tim.

445
00:25:16.057 --> 00:25:18.727
Would it be okay if I sent out
a companywide email?

446
00:25:18.727 --> 00:25:19.561
Of course.

447
00:25:20.562 --> 00:25:21.479
Thanks Paula.

448
00:25:23.273 --> 00:25:25.066
Anything more from the police?

449
00:25:25.066 --> 00:25:27.235
Suicide. open and shut.

450
00:25:27.235 --> 00:25:28.862
Why?

451
00:25:28.862 --> 00:25:30.697
I mean. did Tim seem depressed
to you?

452
00:25:30.697 --> 00:25:31.698
Nuh uh.

453
00:25:32.782 --> 00:25:33.825
Was he having money problems?

454
00:25:33.825 --> 00:25:34.909
Oh no.

455
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:36.661
Tim was very wealthy.

456
00:25:36.661 --> 00:25:40.707
His position here was more
for status than for a paycheck.

457
00:25:40.707 --> 00:25:42.500
It just doesn't make any sense.

458
00:25:43.501 --> 00:25:45.295
Well I've learned that people
often only show us

459
00:25:45.295 --> 00:25:46.796
what they want us to see.

460
00:25:48.757 --> 00:25:50.467
I know this is tough.

461
00:25:50.467 --> 00:25:52.218
Chin up.

462
00:25:52.218 --> 00:25:53.511
Everyone's watching.

463
00:26:06.691 --> 00:26:09.110
Our win seems like a million
years ago. doesn't it?

464
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.946
Yeah.

465
00:26:11.946 --> 00:26:14.157
This is really hitting home. huh?

466
00:26:14.157 --> 00:26:16.659
Yeah. I mean. it's just...
it's such a shock.

467
00:26:18.703 --> 00:26:20.497
You know. I came in today

468
00:26:20.497 --> 00:26:23.416
thinking it was just another
work day and then...

469
00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:26.294
Paula. she told me
what happened

470
00:26:26.294 --> 00:26:28.755
and I just... I can't
believe it.

471
00:26:28.755 --> 00:26:29.964
Paula told you?

472
00:26:29.964 --> 00:26:33.176
Yeah. this morning. Why?

473
00:26:33.176 --> 00:26:36.513
No. you're right.
That is unbelievable.

474
00:26:39.683 --> 00:26:41.810
Well... hang in there.

475
00:26:51.778 --> 00:26:54.572
I'm gonna miss you too but
you've got a new family now.

476
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:03.998
Hey.

477
00:27:03.998 --> 00:27:05.000
Are you sure you saw Kyle
running out

478
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.209
of the building last night?

479
00:27:06.209 --> 00:27:08.294
Positive.
It's in my log book.

480
00:27:08.294 --> 00:27:09.879
You have a log book?

481
00:27:09.879 --> 00:27:12.340
Yes. I have a log book.

482
00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.720
At 7:43 PM Kyle left the Ironman
Gym on Roosevelt Ave.

483
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.848
in a different suit
than he entered with.

484
00:27:19.848 --> 00:27:23.184
At 7:56 PM he arrived
at the office parking lot.

485
00:27:23.184 --> 00:27:25.562
He walked into the building
at 7:58

486
00:27:25.562 --> 00:27:27.981
and minutes later he ran
to the car and drove away.

487
00:27:29.691 --> 00:27:32.652
I just talked to Kyle and
something isn't making sense.

488
00:27:32.652 --> 00:27:35.030
He said that he found out
about Tim this morning.

489
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.364
That's impossible.

490
00:27:36.364 --> 00:27:37.574
He was running away
from the building

491
00:27:37.574 --> 00:27:39.868
like he'd committed
a crime last night.

492
00:27:39.868 --> 00:27:41.578
There is something off
about Tim's death.

493
00:27:41.578 --> 00:27:43.872
I feel it and I know
you do too.

494
00:27:43.872 --> 00:27:47.125
Slow down there. Columbo.
Let's not jump to conclusions.

495
00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:48.376
Or maybe...

496
00:27:48.376 --> 00:27:51.546
or maybe I need to follow him
again tonight.

497
00:27:51.546 --> 00:27:53.840
Except he's going to this
company drinks tonight

498
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.258
we're having for Tim.

499
00:27:55.258 --> 00:27:57.385
Great!
I'll come to that.

500
00:27:57.385 --> 00:27:59.220
And then... and then maybe
before. you know.

501
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.223
you and I could.
uh. get pizza.

502
00:28:02.223 --> 00:28:05.185
No! No pizza.
I'm still mad at you.

503
00:28:05.185 --> 00:28:06.394
Of course.

504
00:28:08.104 --> 00:28:09.856
We can do Chinese.

505
00:28:09.856 --> 00:28:10.857
Deal.

506
00:28:10.857 --> 00:28:11.775
Done.

507
00:28:16.446 --> 00:28:21.534
Hey. Uh... I need a small
quick favor.

508
00:28:25.538 --> 00:28:27.540
I've never done this
for a student before

509
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.502
and I'm only doing so now

510
00:28:30.502 --> 00:28:32.045
because I believe
in your potential.

511
00:28:32.045 --> 00:28:33.713
Understood?

512
00:28:33.713 --> 00:28:34.756
Understood.

513
00:28:41.137 --> 00:28:43.348
It's no suicide note.

514
00:28:43.348 --> 00:28:44.391
None found.

515
00:28:45.684 --> 00:28:49.813
By the way. this wasn't free.
You owe me 7.50.

516
00:28:49.813 --> 00:28:52.482
I mean. like...
like a bribe?

517
00:28:52.482 --> 00:28:54.526
No. Copies.

518
00:28:55.777 --> 00:28:57.779
- Here's the receipt.
- Right.

519
00:28:57.779 --> 00:29:00.532
Who takes a $7 bribe?

520
00:29:11.793 --> 00:29:15.380
Suicide awareness for charity
in honor of Tim.

521
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.590
That is just so thoughtful.

522
00:29:18.633 --> 00:29:19.801
How are you holding up?

523
00:29:19.801 --> 00:29:20.969
I'm hanging in there.

524
00:29:22.512 --> 00:29:25.348
Tim looked out for everyone.
But who was looking out for him?

525
00:29:27.767 --> 00:29:28.768
Thank you.

526
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.855
I told you I should've brought
my cowboy hat.

527
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.651
Alden.

528
00:30:20.904 --> 00:30:23.531
Birdie's hus... husband.

529
00:30:26.743 --> 00:30:30.413
Yeah. We met at the. uh.
holiday gala last year.

530
00:30:34.876 --> 00:30:36.336
I'm sorry about Tim.

531
00:30:40.173 --> 00:30:41.549
Oh. you... you two were close.

532
00:30:44.886 --> 00:30:47.222
Oh. You were very close.

533
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.975
I loved him.

534
00:30:50.975 --> 00:30:52.352
Oh.

535
00:30:53.687 --> 00:30:57.857
It must be hard.
Keeping all that a secret.

536
00:31:00.068 --> 00:31:03.613
We were going on a cruise
next month.

537
00:31:03.613 --> 00:31:06.282
You know. he told his wife
about me.

538
00:31:06.282 --> 00:31:09.869
His wife knew that you guys
were in a relationship?

539
00:31:09.869 --> 00:31:11.538
Yeah. that's what Tim said.

540
00:31:11.538 --> 00:31:13.123
Hey. can I ask you something?

541
00:31:13.123 --> 00:31:14.958
What's the deal with
your license plate?

542
00:31:14.958 --> 00:31:15.834
KRSHNIT?

543
00:31:17.502 --> 00:31:18.712
Yeah. Um...

544
00:31:20.005 --> 00:31:23.258
Tim encouraged me to get
that actually.

545
00:31:23.258 --> 00:31:27.178
Uh... it just. it reminds me
every day

546
00:31:27.178 --> 00:31:29.889
to go after what I want.
you know?

547
00:31:32.851 --> 00:31:34.227
I can get on board with that.

548
00:31:36.688 --> 00:31:39.691
I am so glad that you two
are getting along.

549
00:31:39.691 --> 00:31:41.860
But I think it's time
to hit the trail.

550
00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.945
Alright.

551
00:31:43.945 --> 00:31:46.823
Catch you at the next rodeo?
Partner.

552
00:31:46.823 --> 00:31:48.199
Yeah.

553
00:31:48.199 --> 00:31:49.743
One day at a time. buddy.

554
00:32:00.128 --> 00:32:02.422
Kyle and Tim together?

555
00:32:02.422 --> 00:32:03.423
I know.

556
00:32:03.423 --> 00:32:05.925
I did not see that one coming.

557
00:32:05.925 --> 00:32:07.552
And Penelope knew about it?

558
00:32:07.552 --> 00:32:09.262
If Tim was gonna leave
his wife for Kyle.

559
00:32:09.262 --> 00:32:11.348
he would take all of his money
with him.

560
00:32:11.348 --> 00:32:13.808
I call that motive.

561
00:32:13.808 --> 00:32:17.437
Or... the plot of a Murder
She Wrote episode.

562
00:32:17.437 --> 00:32:18.855
Where's your evidence?

563
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:21.566
Oh. I'll find some.

564
00:32:21.566 --> 00:32:22.609
Mmhmm.

565
00:32:28.782 --> 00:32:31.326
Okay. How about this?

566
00:32:31.326 --> 00:32:32.744
We go to Tim's funeral.

567
00:32:32.744 --> 00:32:34.120
we strike up a friendly
conversation with the widow.

568
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.330
and then when
she's distracted...

569
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.665
Alden. go to sleep.
I'm tired.

570
00:32:37.665 --> 00:32:41.544
Babe! You know I do my best
brainstorming in bed.

571
00:32:45.423 --> 00:32:48.051
Okay. How about this?

572
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:51.930
Tomorrow we drop off some of
Tim's things from his office

573
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:52.931
and size up the wife.

574
00:32:52.931 --> 00:32:54.391
The widow.

575
00:32:54.391 --> 00:32:55.934
She sounds way more guilty
when you say it like that.

576
00:32:55.934 --> 00:32:58.186
Fine. The widow.

577
00:32:58.186 --> 00:33:00.021
Marrying you was the best thing
I've ever done.

578
00:33:14.411 --> 00:33:16.246
I thought Tim was loaded.

579
00:33:16.246 --> 00:33:17.956
Well this isn't his place.
this is Paula's.

580
00:33:17.956 --> 00:33:21.042
Can you believe Eleonore had
Paula clean out Tim's office?

581
00:33:22.794 --> 00:33:23.420
Good morning.

582
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.879
- Hi.
- Come on in.

583
00:33:24.879 --> 00:33:26.381
- Thanks so much.
- Yeah.

584
00:33:28.258 --> 00:33:29.843
I've just got Tim's stuff
over here

585
00:33:29.843 --> 00:33:33.138
so give me a second and
make yourselves at home.

586
00:33:33.138 --> 00:33:34.097
Okay.

587
00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:39.853
Wow. I didn't know she was
so into horses.

588
00:33:39.853 --> 00:33:41.646
Oh. you noticed that too?

589
00:33:41.646 --> 00:33:43.398
You know. it's kind of charming
when it's in a bar

590
00:33:43.398 --> 00:33:46.735
but when it's in your house
it's a cry for help.

591
00:33:46.735 --> 00:33:50.530
Says the guy who has no less
than 20 robots in his garage.

592
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:51.322
Help.

593
00:33:51.322 --> 00:33:52.866
Here we go.

594
00:33:52.866 --> 00:33:54.617
Oh. Thanks so much. Paula.

595
00:33:54.617 --> 00:33:55.410
Thank you.

596
00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:57.495
Is this. um. is that you?

597
00:33:57.495 --> 00:34:00.665
Yeah. That... that's me
and my sister. Caroline.

598
00:34:00.665 --> 00:34:04.210
Now she's my angel in heaven
shining down on me.

599
00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:05.837
I'm so sorry.

600
00:34:05.837 --> 00:34:07.714
So sorry.

601
00:34:07.714 --> 00:34:10.759
Well... thank you so much
for keeping these safe. Paula.

602
00:34:10.759 --> 00:34:12.218
Anything for Tim.

603
00:34:12.218 --> 00:34:14.346
And if there's something else
that you need.

604
00:34:14.346 --> 00:34:16.264
please just ask me.

605
00:34:16.264 --> 00:34:17.849
We will.

606
00:34:17.849 --> 00:34:18.767
Take care.

607
00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:22.937
Thanks again. Paula.

608
00:34:22.937 --> 00:34:23.980
Bye.

609
00:34:33.198 --> 00:34:34.783
Okay.

610
00:34:35.492 --> 00:34:37.577
Now we're talking.

611
00:34:37.577 --> 00:34:39.704
Hello Governor.

612
00:34:39.704 --> 00:34:41.706
That's a house.

613
00:34:41.706 --> 00:34:45.126
On behalf of the firm. I wanted
to offer our services

614
00:34:45.126 --> 00:34:49.381
in case you wanted any help
at all with Tim's estate.

615
00:34:49.381 --> 00:34:52.133
Oh. Timmy had many things.

616
00:34:52.133 --> 00:34:54.052
An estate was not one of them.

617
00:34:56.304 --> 00:34:57.764
So all this...

618
00:34:57.764 --> 00:35:00.684
Oh dear. all of this
is in my name.

619
00:35:00.684 --> 00:35:02.977
From my father's side
of the family.

620
00:35:02.977 --> 00:35:05.230
Not even... life insurance?

621
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:09.275
He had a meager $100.000 policy
that didn't pay out to suicides.

622
00:35:09.275 --> 00:35:10.527
Did you see any signs
at all

623
00:35:10.527 --> 00:35:11.903
that Tim might've
been depressed?

624
00:35:11.903 --> 00:35:13.405
Hardly.

625
00:35:13.405 --> 00:35:15.532
He was excited about going on
that cruise next month

626
00:35:15.532 --> 00:35:17.409
with that boy from the office.

627
00:35:17.409 --> 00:35:18.618
So you did know about that?

628
00:35:18.618 --> 00:35:21.538
That Tim was gay?
Yes. I knew.

629
00:35:21.538 --> 00:35:23.415
We didn't keep secrets
from each other.

630
00:35:23.415 --> 00:35:24.833
It might've been unconventional

631
00:35:24.833 --> 00:35:26.918
but in marriage you're
either growing together

632
00:35:26.918 --> 00:35:29.295
or you're growing apart.

633
00:35:29.295 --> 00:35:32.090
But you didn't come here
for marriage advice.

634
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.592
So why don't you ask me
what you're really thinking?

635
00:35:35.802 --> 00:35:38.096
Do you really think Tim
could've killed himself?

636
00:35:38.096 --> 00:35:39.597
I'm convinced he didn't.

637
00:35:39.597 --> 00:35:42.267
And what... what makes you
so sure?

638
00:35:42.267 --> 00:35:45.437
Tim struggled for years
with who he was.

639
00:35:45.437 --> 00:35:48.606
He finally was comfortable
in his own skin.

640
00:35:48.606 --> 00:35:51.943
Was he having trouble
with anybody or...?

641
00:35:51.943 --> 00:35:53.820
There's one thing that comes
to mind.

642
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.281
There was an incident at the
apartments he was representing

643
00:35:56.281 --> 00:35:58.074
for the new owners.

644
00:35:58.074 --> 00:36:00.285
The Cecil Bay Apartments?

645
00:36:00.285 --> 00:36:02.037
That sounds right.

646
00:36:02.037 --> 00:36:05.832
He said it was sadly something
to do with redevelopment

647
00:36:05.832 --> 00:36:09.502
or some such and that when they
handed out the eviction notices

648
00:36:09.502 --> 00:36:12.297
he was threatened by one
of the tenants there.

649
00:36:12.297 --> 00:36:13.715
He didn't go into much detail

650
00:36:13.715 --> 00:36:17.802
but something gave him
quite a fright.

651
00:36:17.802 --> 00:36:18.887
Hmm.

652
00:36:18.887 --> 00:36:20.013
I take it by this line
of questioning

653
00:36:20.013 --> 00:36:21.222
you're investigating this.

654
00:36:21.222 --> 00:36:22.098
- Yes.
- No.

655
00:36:23.683 --> 00:36:25.685
Well. not in any
official capacity.

656
00:36:25.685 --> 00:36:28.772
Well. not... not in any
official capacity.

657
00:36:28.772 --> 00:36:32.317
If you have any other comments
or anything else occurs to you.

658
00:36:32.317 --> 00:36:33.693
please feel free to contact us.

659
00:36:33.693 --> 00:36:35.653
And again. if the firm...

660
00:36:35.653 --> 00:36:37.489
if the firm can help you
in any way.

661
00:36:37.489 --> 00:36:39.657
please don't hesitate to ask us.
- Sure.

662
00:36:39.657 --> 00:36:43.203
I think your husband
is doing quite enough.

663
00:36:43.203 --> 00:36:44.579
Yes. he has.

664
00:36:45.038 --> 00:36:46.706
Marcia will see you out.

665
00:36:53.004 --> 00:36:55.048
Thank you so much
for your hospitality.

666
00:36:56.091 --> 00:36:57.092
One more thing...

667
00:36:57.092 --> 00:36:58.301
Alden. we have to go.

668
00:36:59.636 --> 00:37:00.929
Let's be honest.

669
00:37:00.929 --> 00:37:02.430
You see everything
that goes on around here.

670
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.850
You notice anything strange
about Tim's behavior lately?

671
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.852
Bill Coulter from
the yacht club.

672
00:37:07.852 --> 00:37:10.355
I know they were involved
in some sort of lawsuit

673
00:37:10.355 --> 00:37:11.940
with each other

674
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:16.528
but last week Bill and Tim had
an argument in the driveway.

675
00:37:16.528 --> 00:37:19.197
What happened?
Did he get violent? Physical?

676
00:37:19.197 --> 00:37:22.534
Bill didn't get out of the car.
But there was a lot of yelling.

677
00:37:22.534 --> 00:37:23.868
What was the lawsuit about?

678
00:37:23.868 --> 00:37:28.415
I don't know.
But they were both very angry.

679
00:37:28.415 --> 00:37:30.000
That's my business card.

680
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.044
Feel free to contact me.
day or night. preferably day.

681
00:37:34.879 --> 00:37:35.839
Good day.

682
00:37:37.257 --> 00:37:39.300
Business cards. really?

683
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.760
I printed up a few.

684
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.345
I'm trying out a couple
different fonts.

685
00:37:42.345 --> 00:37:44.764
Ugh. I gotta get back to work.
I'll drop you off at home. Okay?

686
00:37:44.764 --> 00:37:46.266
I thought we were going
to the yacht club.

687
00:37:46.266 --> 00:37:48.643
Well as much as I do love their
Cobb salad. I just can't.

688
00:37:48.643 --> 00:37:49.894
I don't have time.

689
00:37:49.894 --> 00:37:51.438
Since when have you been
to the yacht club?

690
00:37:51.438 --> 00:37:52.772
Lots of times.
They're our clients.

691
00:37:52.772 --> 00:37:54.149
Well let's go then.

692
00:37:54.149 --> 00:37:55.942
I can't. Eleonore's breathing
down my neck.

693
00:37:57.861 --> 00:38:00.280
Actually... that's perfect.

694
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.032
Then you can get the files
on that case that Penelope

695
00:38:02.032 --> 00:38:03.700
was talking about.
The Cecil...

696
00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.784
- The Cecil Bay Apartments.
- The Cecil Bay Apartments. yeah.

697
00:38:04.784 --> 00:38:06.077
The Cecil Bay Apartments
have new owners

698
00:38:06.077 --> 00:38:08.580
and they wanna turn them
into high-end condos.

699
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.956
Tim was dealing with
the current tenants.

700
00:38:09.956 --> 00:38:11.875
trying to get them out nicely.

701
00:38:11.875 --> 00:38:13.918
Well. that sounds like a recipe
for bad blood.

702
00:38:13.918 --> 00:38:16.629
We definitely need
to get those files.

703
00:38:16.629 --> 00:38:18.923
No. No. no. no.
No one's going over any files.

704
00:38:18.923 --> 00:38:20.717
That's privileged information.

705
00:38:20.717 --> 00:38:23.970
Ah. Got it.
Playing by the book.

706
00:38:25.013 --> 00:38:26.473
No. I'm not playing anything
any way.

707
00:38:26.473 --> 00:38:27.807
No. I gotcha.

708
00:38:28.641 --> 00:38:30.477
Alden. there's no...
nothing to follow. Okay?

709
00:38:31.936 --> 00:38:34.314
No. You know what. I have
to get to work. okay?

710
00:38:34.314 --> 00:38:36.775
And I would love to do this all
day but I actually have a job

711
00:38:36.775 --> 00:38:38.777
that I have to get
to the office for.

712
00:38:38.777 --> 00:38:40.779
It's fine. I can go by myself.

713
00:38:52.207 --> 00:38:55.835
Mister... Coulter.

714
00:38:55.835 --> 00:38:58.713
You can take the salad
but leave the drink.

715
00:38:58.713 --> 00:39:01.424
Actually... I was hoping
you and I

716
00:39:01.424 --> 00:39:03.968
could have a friendly
little chat.

717
00:39:03.968 --> 00:39:06.638
Depends. Are you working
for my ex-wife?

718
00:39:06.638 --> 00:39:07.972
No.

719
00:39:07.972 --> 00:39:08.973
Then sure.

720
00:39:12.394 --> 00:39:14.187
Interesting book.

721
00:39:14.187 --> 00:39:17.607
<i>Knots For Sailors.</i>
It's driving me crazy.

722
00:39:17.607 --> 00:39:22.737
I wanna talk to you about...
Tim Grant.

723
00:39:22.737 --> 00:39:25.156
I thought you said this
was gonna be a friendly chat.

724
00:39:25.156 --> 00:39:28.034
Oh. So I see you've heard
the news?

725
00:39:28.034 --> 00:39:29.536
I heard he checked out early.

726
00:39:29.536 --> 00:39:30.787
That's one theory.

727
00:39:30.787 --> 00:39:32.247
But you have another.

728
00:39:33.373 --> 00:39:38.003
Rumor has it you and he had
a pretty heated argument.

729
00:39:38.003 --> 00:39:40.213
Oh yeah. I wanted
to murder him.

730
00:39:42.382 --> 00:39:43.258
Did you?

731
00:39:44.509 --> 00:39:46.219
Son. if I killed every person
that sued me.

732
00:39:46.219 --> 00:39:47.929
I'd be a serial killer.

733
00:39:49.014 --> 00:39:50.849
What was the lawsuit about?

734
00:39:50.849 --> 00:39:53.435
Yacht stuff.
Rich old guy drama.

735
00:39:53.435 --> 00:39:55.979
I'm honored that you think
I'm capable of murdering Tim

736
00:39:55.979 --> 00:39:59.357
but I just don't see
that happening.

737
00:39:59.357 --> 00:40:02.402
Oh yeah? Why is that?

738
00:40:09.409 --> 00:40:12.412
Hip replacement a month ago.
lost a fight with a sidewalk.

739
00:40:12.412 --> 00:40:14.706
I don't think I'd stand much
of a chance with Tim.

740
00:40:14.706 --> 00:40:16.750
Oh!

741
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.002
That's why you waited
in the car.

742
00:40:19.002 --> 00:40:21.421
You're a very bright young man.

743
00:40:24.341 --> 00:40:25.467
Thanks for lunch.

744
00:40:28.303 --> 00:40:29.304
What?

745
00:40:37.604 --> 00:40:40.148
Five missed calls this morning. Birdie.

746
00:40:41.483 --> 00:40:42.942
I'm sorry.

747
00:40:42.942 --> 00:40:44.903
That's five times I needed you
and you weren't there.

748
00:40:44.903 --> 00:40:47.530
Alden and I took a few of
Tim's things out to his wife.

749
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:52.327
Oh. That's very sweet of you
but that is not your job.

750
00:40:52.327 --> 00:40:55.413
You're right. You're right.
But I'm here now. Okay?

751
00:40:55.413 --> 00:40:56.456
My head's in the game.

752
00:40:56.456 --> 00:40:57.624
There are a dozen people

753
00:40:57.624 --> 00:40:59.292
clawing their way
to the top here

754
00:40:59.292 --> 00:41:01.544
and right now you aren't
one of them.

755
00:41:01.544 --> 00:41:02.837
The door's open. Birdie.

756
00:41:02.837 --> 00:41:04.923
but I can only hold it open
for you so long.

757
00:41:04.923 --> 00:41:07.092
I'm doing the best that I can.

758
00:41:07.092 --> 00:41:10.345
Well. it pains me to say this.
but it needs to be better.

759
00:41:23.274 --> 00:41:26.611
Hey girl. Figured you could use
a midday pick me up.

760
00:41:26.611 --> 00:41:28.238
Oh. wow.

761
00:41:28.238 --> 00:41:29.906
I can't remember the last time
someone brought me a coffee.

762
00:41:29.906 --> 00:41:31.449
Oh. it's nothing.

763
00:41:31.449 --> 00:41:34.285
Uh... hey. While I have you.
a quick favor to ask you.

764
00:41:34.285 --> 00:41:36.996
Have you seen the files on
the Cecil Bay Apartments?

765
00:41:36.996 --> 00:41:38.873
Oh. are you taking over
that case from Tim?

766
00:41:38.873 --> 00:41:40.458
I'm just trying to fill in
some of the gaps

767
00:41:40.458 --> 00:41:41.459
that Tim left behind.

768
00:41:41.459 --> 00:41:42.544
That's great.

769
00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.880
Uh... Yeah.

770
00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.007
Here you go.

771
00:41:47.007 --> 00:41:48.008
That should be everything
you need.

772
00:41:48.008 --> 00:41:49.884
Great. Thank you so much.

773
00:41:50.719 --> 00:41:52.721
Oh... and hey.
one more thing.

774
00:41:52.721 --> 00:41:54.305
When Tim gave notice
to the tenants.

775
00:41:54.305 --> 00:41:57.350
did he mention seeing anything
strange or...?

776
00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:58.893
Strange?

777
00:41:58.893 --> 00:42:02.856
Oh. you mean like that old lady
with the gun in her nightgown?

778
00:42:02.856 --> 00:42:04.607
I would classify that
as strange.

779
00:42:04.607 --> 00:42:06.693
I'm sure it was.

780
00:42:06.693 --> 00:42:09.571
No. But she did really
spook him.

781
00:42:09.571 --> 00:42:10.905
Huh.

782
00:42:11.656 --> 00:42:12.907
Thanks.

783
00:42:18.204 --> 00:42:22.042
Natbot 8.000.
Can you solve Tim's murder?

784
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:26.546
Don't look at me like that.
That's what you're here for.

785
00:42:28.298 --> 00:42:30.425
- Hey.
- Hey.

786
00:42:30.425 --> 00:42:32.010
How's the office?

787
00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:34.721
Definitely not as fun as
what we were doing before.

788
00:42:34.721 --> 00:42:36.097
Any luck at the yacht club?

789
00:42:36.097 --> 00:42:38.350
Nope. Swing and a miss.

790
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:39.768
Hmm.

791
00:42:39.768 --> 00:42:42.312
Well. I thought these
might help.

792
00:42:46.191 --> 00:42:47.525
The Cecil Bay Apartment files?

793
00:42:47.525 --> 00:42:48.735
Mmhmm.

794
00:42:48.735 --> 00:42:50.070
What changed your mind?

795
00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:51.237
You know. I just thought

796
00:42:51.237 --> 00:42:53.948
playing it by the book... overrated.

797
00:43:01.623 --> 00:43:04.668
Okay. Let's get all the tenants
up on the board.

798
00:43:04.668 --> 00:43:07.420
shake the tree.
see what comes out.

799
00:43:28.024 --> 00:43:30.443
There are 15 tenants in
the Cecil Bay building.

800
00:43:30.443 --> 00:43:33.488
So Tim. acting on behalf
of the new owners.

801
00:43:33.488 --> 00:43:35.490
was in the process of evicting
the tenants

802
00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:37.242
so they could turn the building
into luxury condos.

803
00:43:37.242 --> 00:43:38.576
Right. On that fact alone.

804
00:43:38.576 --> 00:43:40.453
everybody had a motive
to want Tim gone.

805
00:43:40.453 --> 00:43:42.539
And our working theory
is that same person

806
00:43:42.539 --> 00:43:45.208
went to Tim's office three days
later. killed him.

807
00:43:45.208 --> 00:43:46.459
making it look like a suicide.

808
00:43:46.459 --> 00:43:48.128
Exactly.

809
00:43:48.128 --> 00:43:50.130
We've been able to definitively
rule out 12 out of 15 tenants

810
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.381
for various reasons.

811
00:43:51.381 --> 00:43:53.299
Either lack of means
or opportunity or both.

812
00:43:53.299 --> 00:43:55.719
Which leaves us three
potential suspects.

813
00:43:55.719 --> 00:43:57.095
Right.

814
00:43:57.095 --> 00:43:59.806
Number one.
Francis Taylor.

815
00:44:00.974 --> 00:44:02.350
Apartment 201.

816
00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:04.436
Now this guy was convicted
of manslaughter in 1982.

817
00:44:04.436 --> 00:44:05.979
he served 12 years.

818
00:44:05.979 --> 00:44:07.439
he's been living in
the building ever since.

819
00:44:07.439 --> 00:44:08.815
He's been employed
as a counsellor

820
00:44:08.815 --> 00:44:10.275
for newly released inmates.

821
00:44:10.275 --> 00:44:11.901
helping them get adjusted
to their new lives.

822
00:44:11.901 --> 00:44:14.738
It's possible he did it.
I don't see it.

823
00:44:14.738 --> 00:44:15.822
I don't either.

824
00:44:17.365 --> 00:44:20.618
And then we have the old lady
with a gun in her nightgown.

825
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.289
Eugenia Carmopolis.
apartment 112.

826
00:44:24.289 --> 00:44:26.750
She does have a concealed carry
permit so she has the means.

827
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.544
Only problem is
she's legally blind.

828
00:44:29.544 --> 00:44:30.712
Which leaves us...

829
00:44:31.755 --> 00:44:32.839
Frederick Gasko.

830
00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:35.467
Apartment 101.

831
00:44:35.467 --> 00:44:37.761
Now Mr. Gasko is the only tenant
in the building

832
00:44:37.761 --> 00:44:41.848
who pays his rent in cash
and the only picture on file

833
00:44:41.848 --> 00:44:43.933
is from a driver's license
from 1989.

834
00:44:43.933 --> 00:44:45.769
Which I think we both agree
is totally fake.

835
00:44:45.769 --> 00:44:47.145
For sure.

836
00:44:47.145 --> 00:44:48.271
I can't believe they spelled
Massachusetts wrong.

837
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:49.606
I mean. how do you get away
with that?

838
00:44:49.606 --> 00:44:51.024
No. I think that's actually
the real crime here.

839
00:44:51.024 --> 00:44:52.734
But the question is...

840
00:44:52.734 --> 00:44:55.362
why does Mr. Gasko
need a fake ID?

841
00:44:55.362 --> 00:45:02.077
Perhaps it's because Frederick
Gasko and Lean McGuiness

842
00:45:02.077 --> 00:45:04.037
are the same person.

843
00:45:04.037 --> 00:45:05.705
It does look like him.

844
00:45:05.705 --> 00:45:08.041
Because it is him.

845
00:45:08.041 --> 00:45:11.127
One of America's most dangerous
mobsters. on the run. 30 years.

846
00:45:11.127 --> 00:45:12.462
hiding in plain sight.

847
00:45:12.462 --> 00:45:14.839
Lean McGuiness killed Tim
because he was about

848
00:45:14.839 --> 00:45:17.759
to blow his cover and kick him
out of his hiding spot.

849
00:45:17.759 --> 00:45:20.053
Mic drop.
That's the game.

850
00:45:20.053 --> 00:45:21.554
Happy birthday!

851
00:45:21.554 --> 00:45:22.889
Hold up.

852
00:45:22.889 --> 00:45:23.932
I'm bumping on one thing.

853
00:45:23.932 --> 00:45:25.016
What?

854
00:45:26.434 --> 00:45:29.229
Lean McGuiness' body was
discovered before Tim died.

855
00:45:29.229 --> 00:45:31.815
How does a dead man
kill Tim?

856
00:45:34.484 --> 00:45:36.403
Okay. that's actually
a really good point.

857
00:45:36.403 --> 00:45:38.321
I'm not sure but there has to be
a connection.

858
00:45:38.321 --> 00:45:39.322
Come on!

859
00:45:39.322 --> 00:45:41.074
There's no way
it's a coincidence

860
00:45:41.074 --> 00:45:42.909
that Tim very likely
discovered Lean

861
00:45:42.909 --> 00:45:46.162
and then both Tim and Lean were
found dead within the same week.

862
00:45:46.162 --> 00:45:47.414
It does seem unlikely.

863
00:45:47.414 --> 00:45:48.581
Come on.

864
00:45:48.581 --> 00:45:51.251
Just acknowledge
we're onto something here.

865
00:45:51.251 --> 00:45:55.714
Alden Case. you are becoming
quite the investigator.

866
00:46:06.975 --> 00:46:09.853
You're up early.
Did you get any sleep?

867
00:46:09.853 --> 00:46:12.981
Actually. I woke up in
the middle of the night

868
00:46:12.981 --> 00:46:14.733
with an idea.

869
00:46:14.733 --> 00:46:18.653
I know... what we need to do.

870
00:46:18.653 --> 00:46:20.405
- Veggie omelets?
- Mmhmm.

871
00:46:20.405 --> 00:46:21.531
- Kiwis.
- Yes.

872
00:46:21.531 --> 00:46:24.617
- Strawberries and pancakes?
- Correct.

873
00:46:26.077 --> 00:46:27.912
What are you
buttering me up for?

874
00:46:27.912 --> 00:46:29.831
Hear me out.

875
00:46:29.831 --> 00:46:32.334
I think we need to visit
the Cecil Bay Apartments

876
00:46:32.334 --> 00:46:34.252
and see if Frederick Gasko
is there.

877
00:46:34.252 --> 00:46:36.880
Whoa! That's a big step.
don't you think?

878
00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.423
You saw the pictures.

879
00:46:38.423 --> 00:46:40.967
Frederick Gasko
is Lean McGuiness.
It's the same person.

880
00:46:40.967 --> 00:46:42.594
Yes. they do look alike. Okay.

881
00:46:42.594 --> 00:46:46.639
But I think the safest thing
to do would be to call the FBI

882
00:46:46.639 --> 00:46:47.682
and tell them what we think.

883
00:46:47.682 --> 00:46:49.267
Argh!

884
00:46:49.267 --> 00:46:50.435
They are still investigating
what happened to Lean McGuiness.

885
00:46:50.435 --> 00:46:51.686
We don't wanna get
in the middle of that.

886
00:46:51.686 --> 00:46:52.687
Okay.

887
00:46:54.981 --> 00:46:57.984
Before we do that.
how about this?

888
00:46:57.984 --> 00:47:00.278
We go to the apartments.
we knock on the door.

889
00:47:00.278 --> 00:47:03.156
if Frederick Gasko answers.
that's it I quit. game over.

890
00:47:03.156 --> 00:47:04.491
And if he doesn't answer?

891
00:47:04.491 --> 00:47:06.493
If Gasko's not there.
we call the FBI.

892
00:47:06.493 --> 00:47:07.619
we tell them what we know.

893
00:47:07.619 --> 00:47:09.120
And you will stand down?

894
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.915
I will hand the information
over to the fancy people

895
00:47:11.915 --> 00:47:15.835
with their badges. Promise.

896
00:47:15.835 --> 00:47:16.961
Let me think about it.

897
00:47:16.961 --> 00:47:18.254
I have this meeting
at 10:00 AM

898
00:47:18.254 --> 00:47:19.756
that I am not looking
forward to.

899
00:47:19.756 --> 00:47:22.509
Oh yeah. I bet.
I bet you do.

900
00:47:22.509 --> 00:47:25.720
Meetings are tough.
You just think about it. Okay?

901
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:26.888
Mmhmm.

902
00:47:26.888 --> 00:47:27.806
Just think about it.

903
00:47:27.806 --> 00:47:29.974
That's... that's excellent.

904
00:47:29.974 --> 00:47:31.726
You got a lot of knots
back here. what's going on?

905
00:47:31.726 --> 00:47:33.103
I know. Oh God.

906
00:47:34.312 --> 00:47:36.564
Yes. I know.
100 percent. Mr. Keller.

907
00:47:36.564 --> 00:47:38.400
I mean. we're very excited.
you know.

908
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.068
We can't wait
for the next steps.

909
00:47:40.068 --> 00:47:42.320
Thanks Ben. chat soon.

910
00:47:43.196 --> 00:47:44.531
Wait. was that the Keller call?

911
00:47:45.573 --> 00:47:47.033
I thought it was at 10:00.

912
00:47:47.033 --> 00:47:48.660
It got moved to 9:00.
I thought you knew that.

913
00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:50.328
Kyle. great work.

914
00:47:50.328 --> 00:47:52.163
Start putting together
your proposal.

915
00:47:53.581 --> 00:47:54.624
I'm on it.

916
00:47:56.751 --> 00:47:58.878
Doesn't feel good.
does it?

917
00:47:58.878 --> 00:48:01.006
You did this on purpose.

918
00:48:01.006 --> 00:48:03.842
Kyle isn't half the lawyer
you are.

919
00:48:03.842 --> 00:48:05.385
But he's hungry.

920
00:48:13.893 --> 00:48:17.647
Hey. Let's do this.
Pick me up at 6:00

921
00:48:22.777 --> 00:48:23.737
This is it.

922
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.287
I can't decide if I want Gasko
to be home or not.

923
00:48:32.287 --> 00:48:35.290
Okay. So we are just knocking
on the door. Alden.

924
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:36.207
And if he doesn't answer...

925
00:48:36.207 --> 00:48:38.168
I will stand down.

926
00:48:38.168 --> 00:48:39.711
Okay. let's do this.

927
00:48:39.711 --> 00:48:40.587
One sec.

928
00:48:42.422 --> 00:48:43.381
Fake mustache.

929
00:48:43.381 --> 00:48:45.008
Why would you need
a fake mustache?

930
00:48:45.008 --> 00:48:46.134
So no one knows who we are.

931
00:48:46.134 --> 00:48:47.969
No one knows
who we are anyway!

932
00:48:47.969 --> 00:48:49.304
Exactly.

933
00:48:50.972 --> 00:48:52.098
Alden.

934
00:48:53.767 --> 00:48:54.684
Hmm?

935
00:48:56.394 --> 00:48:58.188
Wait. wait. wait.
What's with the hat?

936
00:48:58.188 --> 00:48:59.606
Come on. rookie.

937
00:49:00.732 --> 00:49:02.108
Oy vey.

938
00:49:03.902 --> 00:49:05.236
I can't believe
we're doing this.

939
00:49:05.236 --> 00:49:06.905
In and out. okay?
We're just knocking on the door.

940
00:49:06.905 --> 00:49:08.114
Just follow my lead.

941
00:49:08.114 --> 00:49:09.616
This is what I've been
training for.

942
00:49:11.201 --> 00:49:13.912
Okay. 102. Ms. Berman.
She's a kindergarten teacher.

943
00:49:15.914 --> 00:49:16.915
Hello?

944
00:49:16.915 --> 00:49:19.209
Yeah. This is. uh.
Mario's pizza.

945
00:49:19.209 --> 00:49:21.252
What accent is that?

946
00:49:21.252 --> 00:49:23.713
We got a couple of pies here.
they're for 103.

947
00:49:23.713 --> 00:49:25.423
that we can't deliver.

948
00:49:25.423 --> 00:49:26.633
Well that's not
my problem.

949
00:49:28.468 --> 00:49:29.594
Okay. New plan.

950
00:49:29.594 --> 00:49:30.512
Yeah.

951
00:49:30.512 --> 00:49:32.222
We wait until someone
comes out.

952
00:49:32.222 --> 00:49:35.725
Or we just use the keys.

953
00:49:35.725 --> 00:49:36.810
Where did you get those?

954
00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:38.269
They were in the file.

955
00:49:39.896 --> 00:49:41.189
Come on.

956
00:49:41.898 --> 00:49:43.149
Rookie.

957
00:49:44.943 --> 00:49:46.152
Oh.

958
00:49:47.153 --> 00:49:48.613
Charming little spot.

959
00:49:52.075 --> 00:49:53.368
Was it you?

960
00:49:54.953 --> 00:49:55.912
I'm sorry?

961
00:49:55.912 --> 00:49:56.955
Huh?

962
00:49:56.955 --> 00:49:58.873
Was it you who took
my wheelchair?

963
00:49:58.873 --> 00:50:02.585
‘Cause I left it right here and
the next thing I know it's gone.

964
00:50:02.585 --> 00:50:05.338
We... no. no. no.
We haven't seen it.

965
00:50:05.338 --> 00:50:07.465
Are you alright?
Do you need us to take you...

966
00:50:09.509 --> 00:50:11.219
I'll be fine.

967
00:50:14.889 --> 00:50:16.266
Well that checks out.

968
00:50:16.266 --> 00:50:17.559
I think she likes you.

969
00:50:18.101 --> 00:50:19.102
It's the mustache.

970
00:50:19.102 --> 00:50:21.396
Oh... are you jealous?

971
00:50:21.396 --> 00:50:21.938
Maybe.

972
00:50:23.356 --> 00:50:24.482
Yikes.

973
00:50:24.482 --> 00:50:25.442
Okay.

974
00:50:26.526 --> 00:50:28.319
This is it. 101.
This is it. this is it.

975
00:50:28.319 --> 00:50:30.030
Uh... I'm having
second thoughts.

976
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.156
I'm just gonna knock.

977
00:50:31.156 --> 00:50:32.699
It literally says don't knock.

978
00:50:32.699 --> 00:50:34.909
It also says leave packages.
I don't plan to do that either.

979
00:50:34.909 --> 00:50:36.161
Uh...

980
00:50:43.168 --> 00:50:44.461
Mr. Gasko?

981
00:50:46.588 --> 00:50:47.839
Mr. Gasko?

982
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:53.803
Mr. Gasko?

983
00:50:53.803 --> 00:50:54.929
Alden!

984
00:50:54.929 --> 00:50:58.350
- Mr. Gasko?
- Alden. let's go.

985
00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:00.769
Birdie. you need
to get in here.

986
00:51:00.769 --> 00:51:01.853
Uh.

987
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:14.908
This guy needs a housekeeper.

988
00:51:17.619 --> 00:51:18.828
We should really get
outta here.

989
00:51:18.828 --> 00:51:20.246
Yeah. we should.

990
00:51:23.833 --> 00:51:25.293
Oh. my gosh.

991
00:51:25.293 --> 00:51:26.419
What is it?

992
00:51:26.419 --> 00:51:28.380
Look at all this mustard!

993
00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:30.048
This guy must be a real
sandwich nut.

994
00:51:30.048 --> 00:51:31.383
Alden. let's go!
Come on.

995
00:51:31.383 --> 00:51:32.759
Will you relax?
It's not like we're...

996
00:51:33.927 --> 00:51:34.969
What?

997
00:51:34.969 --> 00:51:36.763
Birdie. Check this out.

998
00:51:38.473 --> 00:51:39.391
Alden!

999
00:51:40.767 --> 00:51:41.768
Right.

1000
00:51:43.269 --> 00:51:45.271
Yeah. Now might be a good time
to call the FBI.

1001
00:51:45.855 --> 00:51:47.107
Let's call them from the car.

1002
00:51:47.107 --> 00:51:48.233
I knew we shouldn't
have come here.

1003
00:51:48.233 --> 00:51:49.109
This was a mistake.

1004
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:51.319
Ella. call FBI.

1005
00:51:51.319 --> 00:51:53.571
FBI! Put your hands up.

1006
00:51:53.571 --> 00:51:56.533
Calling
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1007
00:52:00.203 --> 00:52:01.746
FBI.
What's the emergency?

1008
00:52:11.381 --> 00:52:12.674
I could get disbarred for this. Alden.

1009
00:52:12.674 --> 00:52:14.175
I told you we should've gotten
out of there.

1010
00:52:14.175 --> 00:52:16.302
Birdie. we are this close

1011
00:52:16.302 --> 00:52:18.430
to blowing this whole thing
wide open.

1012
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:20.473
What planet are you living on?

1013
00:52:20.473 --> 00:52:23.852
In the real world. if the FBI
has you handcuffed

1014
00:52:23.852 --> 00:52:25.311
in the back of a car.

1015
00:52:25.311 --> 00:52:26.980
that means you have to make
some serious life changes.

1016
00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.773
Okay. Here's what
I think we do.

1017
00:52:28.773 --> 00:52:30.191
No. You know what?

1018
00:52:30.191 --> 00:52:31.860
I can't partake in your
detective fantasy anymore.

1019
00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.653
Okay? I'm done.

1020
00:52:33.653 --> 00:52:34.654
I'm done.

1021
00:52:39.117 --> 00:52:40.535
...Yeah. I'm on it.

1022
00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.540
Unbelievable.
Here he comes.

1023
00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:48.835
Alright. Come on now.

1024
00:52:52.088 --> 00:52:53.757
You're lucky my mom
is who she is.

1025
00:52:53.757 --> 00:52:54.924
Yeah.

1026
00:52:55.842 --> 00:52:57.177
Thank you.

1027
00:52:59.888 --> 00:53:00.930
Your story checks out.

1028
00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:02.015
Of course it does.

1029
00:53:02.015 --> 00:53:04.893
But listen up.
Amateur hour is over.

1030
00:53:04.893 --> 00:53:06.686
You understand?

1031
00:53:06.686 --> 00:53:07.687
You're free to go.

1032
00:53:07.687 --> 00:53:09.481
I am not an amateur.

1033
00:53:09.481 --> 00:53:10.732
I've almost got
my certificate...

1034
00:53:10.732 --> 00:53:13.026
Uh... thank you so much
Special Agent Digbee.

1035
00:53:13.026 --> 00:53:14.319
So sorry for the trouble.

1036
00:53:14.319 --> 00:53:16.654
Okay. Well what about
the Tim Lean connection?

1037
00:53:17.447 --> 00:53:18.698
'Cause I'm starting to think

1038
00:53:18.698 --> 00:53:20.033
that there is a real mob element
at play here.

1039
00:53:20.033 --> 00:53:21.368
In fact my new theory...

1040
00:53:21.368 --> 00:53:25.663
Mr. Case. some free advice.
Stay in your lane.

1041
00:53:25.663 --> 00:53:28.375
Perhaps Reddit would be a more
appropriate arena for you.

1042
00:53:28.375 --> 00:53:29.876
Plus...

1043
00:53:29.876 --> 00:53:32.128
I got an unmarked blue sedan
that's been trailing me around.

1044
00:53:32.128 --> 00:53:34.589
which means we are definitely
close to something.

1045
00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:37.842
- Wait. You're being trailed?
- Yes.

1046
00:53:37.842 --> 00:53:39.094
- By a blue sedan?
- Yes.

1047
00:53:39.094 --> 00:53:40.679
- You're sure?
- Yes!

1048
00:53:40.679 --> 00:53:42.681
- Well this changes everything.
- It does?

1049
00:53:42.681 --> 00:53:43.723
Absolutely...

1050
00:53:45.058 --> 00:53:46.351
Not.

1051
00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:47.310
Oh.

1052
00:53:48.728 --> 00:53:49.688
Counselor.

1053
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:53.233
Alright. I'm going
to talk to them.

1054
00:53:53.233 --> 00:53:55.193
No. no. Alden.
You promised.

1055
00:53:55.193 --> 00:53:56.611
You promised that you would let

1056
00:53:56.611 --> 00:53:58.571
the people with the badges
solve this.

1057
00:53:58.571 --> 00:53:59.948
I am not quitting.

1058
00:54:00.615 --> 00:54:03.159
Oh. there it is.
That look of disappointment.

1059
00:54:03.159 --> 00:54:06.037
Please. Please. It is time
to walk away.

1060
00:54:06.037 --> 00:54:09.290
From what. Birdie?
From the case or...

1061
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:11.251
or from our marriage?

1062
00:54:11.251 --> 00:54:13.795
Maybe... maybe we should
just quit and get divorced.

1063
00:54:13.795 --> 00:54:14.754
Huh Birdie?

1064
00:54:16.256 --> 00:54:17.590
You saw the papers.

1065
00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:19.300
I drew those up after
the cryptocurrency thing.

1066
00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.885
I was angry. Okay?

1067
00:54:20.885 --> 00:54:23.054
You weren't supposed to see.
How did you get those anyway?

1068
00:54:23.054 --> 00:54:25.098
They looked pretty official
to me.

1069
00:54:25.098 --> 00:54:27.267
I might've lied
about accounting

1070
00:54:27.267 --> 00:54:29.894
but you kept a divorce
secret from me.

1071
00:54:29.894 --> 00:54:32.772
I don't know whether to be
hurt or impressed.

1072
00:54:32.772 --> 00:54:34.482
Well. if you saw them
why didn't you say anything?

1073
00:54:34.482 --> 00:54:39.320
Because maybe... maybe
saying it out loud made it true.

1074
00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.614
So... so what is it?

1075
00:54:41.614 --> 00:54:44.367
Are we... are we...
are we done?

1076
00:54:46.036 --> 00:54:47.996
It's like Penelope said.
we're either growing together

1077
00:54:47.996 --> 00:54:49.330
or we're growing apart.

1078
00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:54.085
And for a while now...
we've been growing apart.

1079
00:54:54.085 --> 00:54:55.420
When we got married.

1080
00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:58.256
is this what you pictured
our life being like?

1081
00:54:58.256 --> 00:55:02.302
No. Not exactly.

1082
00:55:02.302 --> 00:55:04.804
I thought we'd. you know.
have a boat and...

1083
00:55:04.804 --> 00:55:06.181
and a kid or two.

1084
00:55:06.181 --> 00:55:09.684
But as long as I'm with you.
none of that matters.

1085
00:55:09.684 --> 00:55:11.770
What did you think it was
gonna be like?

1086
00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:13.229
Not this.

1087
00:55:13.229 --> 00:55:14.689
I'm not quitting on us.

1088
00:55:16.775 --> 00:55:17.776
What are you doing?

1089
00:55:17.776 --> 00:55:19.986
I'm walking home.
Here's the keys.

1090
00:55:21.404 --> 00:55:22.781
It's the other way. Alden.

1091
00:55:22.781 --> 00:55:23.990
Thank you.

1092
00:55:28.244 --> 00:55:29.954
Good evening.
I'm Trisha Murata reporting live

1093
00:55:29.954 --> 00:55:33.750
from the Cecil Bay Apartments
on Third Street.

1094
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:36.503
More pieces of the puzzle
are emerging as investigators

1095
00:55:36.503 --> 00:55:41.383
confirm the location
where notorious mob boss...

1096
00:55:59.526 --> 00:56:01.194
Bird! Bird. Hey. hey.

1097
00:56:02.445 --> 00:56:04.322
So what happened last night?
Is it true?

1098
00:56:04.322 --> 00:56:06.157
Did you get busted by the FBI?

1099
00:56:06.157 --> 00:56:07.325
No.

1100
00:56:07.325 --> 00:56:09.494
Well... not exactly.

1101
00:56:09.494 --> 00:56:10.370
How did you hear?

1102
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:11.621
- Paula.
- Paula.

1103
00:56:11.621 --> 00:56:13.039
Yeah. Yeah

1104
00:56:13.039 --> 00:56:14.666
The Cecil Bay developers
called first thing this morning.

1105
00:56:14.666 --> 00:56:15.333
How bad is it?

1106
00:56:15.333 --> 00:56:16.418
Oh. No. no. no.

1107
00:56:16.418 --> 00:56:17.752
They're ecstatic.

1108
00:56:17.752 --> 00:56:18.878
They are?

1109
00:56:18.878 --> 00:56:20.213
It's now the hottest property
in town.

1110
00:56:20.213 --> 00:56:22.048
Nothing gets rich yuppies
putting down deposits

1111
00:56:22.048 --> 00:56:24.968
more than a condo building
that was once a mob hideout.

1112
00:56:24.968 --> 00:56:26.261
That's great.

1113
00:56:26.261 --> 00:56:28.847
Well. great. I'm glad to hear
you say that.

1114
00:56:28.847 --> 00:56:30.765
So no hard feelings?

1115
00:56:30.765 --> 00:56:31.766
What do you mean?

1116
00:56:31.766 --> 00:56:33.893
Well. I assume Eleonore
told you.

1117
00:56:33.893 --> 00:56:35.770
I'm the lead on Cecil Bay.

1118
00:56:37.355 --> 00:56:39.482
Oh! Yeah. no...
she told me.

1119
00:56:39.482 --> 00:56:42.360
I am so happy for you.

1120
00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.862
- Dream team. yeah?
- Mmhmm.

1121
00:56:43.862 --> 00:56:44.529
Yeah.

1122
00:57:04.257 --> 00:57:06.384
Okay.

1123
00:57:06.384 --> 00:57:09.888
Kyle was having
an affair with Tim.

1124
00:57:09.888 --> 00:57:12.974
Which Tim's wife was oddly
cool about it.

1125
00:57:12.974 --> 00:57:17.645
Simultaneously. Tim was trying
to evict Lean McGuiness

1126
00:57:17.645 --> 00:57:19.856
from his hiding spot
of 30 years.

1127
00:57:19.856 --> 00:57:22.359
Which might've caused Lean
to call his old mob connections

1128
00:57:22.359 --> 00:57:24.694
to get rid of Tim.

1129
00:57:24.694 --> 00:57:27.989
We also know Lean had
a neighbor.

1130
00:57:27.989 --> 00:57:33.578
one Mrs. Eugenia T. Carmopolis.
who was in possession of a gun.

1131
00:57:33.578 --> 00:57:36.456
Now... could this have been
a neighbor dispute?

1132
00:57:36.456 --> 00:57:39.250
Did Lean like to watch
his TV too loud?

1133
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:42.629
We just don't know.

1134
00:57:42.629 --> 00:57:47.801
So apparently the Cecil Bay
Apartments completely sold out.

1135
00:57:47.801 --> 00:57:52.013
Everyone wants to live where
Lean McGuiness was hiding out.

1136
00:57:52.013 --> 00:57:52.972
Hmm.

1137
00:57:55.684 --> 00:57:57.394
Babe.

1138
00:57:57.394 --> 00:57:58.978
That's a big deal.

1139
00:57:58.978 --> 00:58:02.315
We connected the dots to
Lean McGuiness' hiding spot.

1140
00:58:02.315 --> 00:58:04.526
A week after the FBI did.

1141
00:58:04.526 --> 00:58:07.278
Well. they got resources.

1142
00:58:13.493 --> 00:58:15.078
No. no. no.
Let me go first.

1143
00:58:15.078 --> 00:58:16.204
Let me go first.

1144
00:58:18.164 --> 00:58:19.165
What was it?

1145
00:58:21.126 --> 00:58:22.252
What?

1146
00:58:32.345 --> 00:58:33.888
Wait. Alden.
Be careful. be careful.

1147
00:58:33.888 --> 00:58:35.015
It's just a brick.

1148
00:58:35.849 --> 00:58:36.766
Perfect.

1149
00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:38.476
A baseball glove?

1150
00:58:38.476 --> 00:58:39.728
I don't know.

1151
00:58:41.855 --> 00:58:44.858
Will you just... be careful.
Okay? Don't cut yourself.

1152
00:58:46.526 --> 00:58:47.861
What's it say?

1153
00:58:51.406 --> 00:58:53.908
Let sleeping dogs lie.

1154
00:59:02.876 --> 00:59:03.793
Okay.

1155
00:59:04.919 --> 00:59:08.757
So... because you are
"hot on the trail"

1156
00:59:08.757 --> 00:59:11.634
with something involving
"Lean McGuiness".

1157
00:59:11.634 --> 00:59:13.261
you think that the brick
that went through your window

1158
00:59:13.261 --> 00:59:16.556
was somehow "mob related".

1159
00:59:16.556 --> 00:59:19.017
That's correct.
officer air quotes.

1160
00:59:19.017 --> 00:59:20.810
It's officer Newton.
It's not officer air quotes.

1161
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:23.396
Sorry. officer "Newton".

1162
00:59:23.396 --> 00:59:24.314
You know what?

1163
00:59:24.314 --> 00:59:26.649
Officer... are we in danger?

1164
00:59:26.649 --> 00:59:27.859
You know what?

1165
00:59:27.859 --> 00:59:29.402
It's probably just some kids
playing a prank.

1166
00:59:29.402 --> 00:59:30.820
I'll write a report. let you
know if anything comes up.

1167
00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:31.738
Thank you.

1168
00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:34.866
Should I be concerned
about that?

1169
00:59:36.743 --> 00:59:40.413
Oh. that's just
an "art project".

1170
00:59:40.413 --> 00:59:42.290
Don't do things that I do.

1171
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:43.708
Have a nice night.

1172
00:59:43.708 --> 00:59:44.751
Not you.

1173
00:59:47.671 --> 00:59:49.714
Well. why throw a brick
through the window?

1174
00:59:49.714 --> 00:59:52.092
Why not just leave
a note in the mailbox

1175
00:59:52.092 --> 00:59:53.510
or tape it to the front door.

1176
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:55.136
It's to send a message. Alden.

1177
00:59:55.136 --> 00:59:56.930
Leaving a letter
in the mailbox.

1178
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:58.223
not exactly threatening.

1179
00:59:58.223 --> 01:00:00.350
Mmhmm. Well it'd be
the decent thing to do.

1180
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.976
You know what I think
the decent thing to do is?

1181
01:00:01.976 --> 01:00:04.521
I think the decent thing to do
is just to take a step back

1182
01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:07.357
and let things cool down a bit.

1183
01:00:07.357 --> 01:00:09.359
I can't do that.

1184
01:00:09.359 --> 01:00:11.486
Alden... whoever threw
that brick

1185
01:00:11.486 --> 01:00:13.363
knows where we live.

1186
01:00:13.363 --> 01:00:15.115
What if next time
they don't stay outside?

1187
01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:21.913
Waiter.

1188
01:00:21.913 --> 01:00:23.206
Watchmaker's apprentice.

1189
01:00:23.206 --> 01:00:24.207
Cheesemonger.

1190
01:00:24.207 --> 01:00:25.458
Notary.

1191
01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:27.877
T-shirt screen printer.

1192
01:00:27.877 --> 01:00:28.878
Museum docent.

1193
01:00:28.878 --> 01:00:29.879
Barista.

1194
01:00:29.879 --> 01:00:31.256
Crypto currency miner.

1195
01:00:31.256 --> 01:00:32.841
What are you getting at?

1196
01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:35.593
These are all the careers
that I have started and quit.

1197
01:00:35.593 --> 01:00:37.679
And some of them were too easy.
some of them were too hard.

1198
01:00:37.679 --> 01:00:39.556
some of them were
just terrible ideas.

1199
01:00:39.556 --> 01:00:41.850
Yeah. but all those things
make you you.

1200
01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:45.478
I don't wanna be known as the
guy who quits things anymore.

1201
01:00:45.478 --> 01:00:49.816
This case. I have to solve it.

1202
01:00:49.816 --> 01:00:52.318
And that brick...

1203
01:00:52.318 --> 01:00:54.779
that means we're making somebody
very nervous.

1204
01:00:54.779 --> 01:00:58.158
Yeah. And I'm a little scared.

1205
01:00:58.158 --> 01:00:59.451
Me too.

1206
01:01:01.036 --> 01:01:02.078
And I don't know exactly

1207
01:01:02.078 --> 01:01:06.166
how this whole thing's
gonna play out.

1208
01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:08.168
Kinda like me and you.

1209
01:01:11.087 --> 01:01:12.172
But I'm not quitting.

1210
01:01:13.673 --> 01:01:16.718
Because I know in my heart
they're both worth fighting for.

1211
01:01:43.078 --> 01:01:44.537
Wow.

1212
01:01:47.499 --> 01:01:49.876
It was Kyle all along.

1213
01:01:51.002 --> 01:01:53.922
Ado Construction is the company
that was developing the site

1214
01:01:53.922 --> 01:01:55.757
where Lean McGuiness
was found.

1215
01:01:55.757 --> 01:01:58.927
It's on Kyle's shirt
in this picture

1216
01:01:58.927 --> 01:02:02.597
because the owner of the company
is Kyle's uncle!

1217
01:02:02.597 --> 01:02:04.140
How much coffee
have you had?

1218
01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.935
Birdie. this is the connection
that we've been looking for.

1219
01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:10.897
I think Kyle killed
Lean McGuiness and then Tim.

1220
01:02:10.897 --> 01:02:12.607
What? No. I...

1221
01:02:12.607 --> 01:02:15.235
I really don't see Kyle
being capable of one murder.

1222
01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:16.361
let alone two.

1223
01:02:16.361 --> 01:02:17.987
Do you have any proof?

1224
01:02:17.987 --> 01:02:19.239
Not yet.

1225
01:02:19.239 --> 01:02:20.740
I'm working late.
I have to get my steps in.

1226
01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.200
I think it's called running.

1227
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.827
No. It's called getting
your steps in when the office

1228
01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:26.079
has a competition of who
can get the most steps in.

1229
01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:28.248
And Kyle is killing it.

1230
01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:29.124
See what I did there?

1231
01:02:29.124 --> 01:02:30.500
That was pretty good.

1232
01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.712
Look... do your thing
but just please be careful.

1233
01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:34.546
Okay.

1234
01:02:41.845 --> 01:02:44.556
I'm Kyle. I get all my steps in.

1235
01:02:48.268 --> 01:02:50.562
Kyle gets all his steps in.

1236
01:03:01.072 --> 01:03:01.948
Hey Paula.

1237
01:03:01.948 --> 01:03:03.283
Hey Alden.

1238
01:03:03.283 --> 01:03:04.826
Birdie's in her office
if you're looking for her.

1239
01:03:04.826 --> 01:03:07.245
Uh. actually.
I'm looking for you.

1240
01:03:07.245 --> 01:03:08.705
Oh.

1241
01:03:08.705 --> 01:03:10.665
You know how when Tim died
you said to let you know

1242
01:03:10.665 --> 01:03:12.542
if there was anything
you could do to help?

1243
01:03:12.542 --> 01:03:15.211
Well. I need your help.

1244
01:03:15.211 --> 01:03:17.964
Um... you know how everybody's
been tracking their steps

1245
01:03:17.964 --> 01:03:20.592
for that infernal
wellness challenge?

1246
01:03:20.592 --> 01:03:23.553
I have almost hit
my goal this week.

1247
01:03:23.553 --> 01:03:25.388
Good for you!

1248
01:03:25.388 --> 01:03:31.061
Do you have. uh. login info for
the company tracking profile?

1249
01:03:31.061 --> 01:03:32.729
I do.

1250
01:03:32.729 --> 01:03:36.733
And you could pull all the GPS
data for the last... two weeks?

1251
01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:40.570
I've got some work to do now
but I could do it later.

1252
01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:42.280
Should I just give it to Birdie?

1253
01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.990
Oh. No. no. no.
Birdie's slammed.

1254
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:45.241
She's probably gonna
be here all night.

1255
01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:48.078
Um... I could come back
in a couple of hours.

1256
01:03:48.078 --> 01:03:49.579
You know what?

1257
01:03:49.579 --> 01:03:51.748
I have errands to do
in your neighborhood.

1258
01:03:51.748 --> 01:03:53.583
Why don't I just pop
it by tonight?

1259
01:03:53.583 --> 01:03:54.876
That sounds perfect.

1260
01:03:54.876 --> 01:03:56.378
- Great.
- I'll see you then.

1261
01:03:56.378 --> 01:03:58.004
- Okay.
- Okay.

1262
01:03:59.381 --> 01:04:00.632
Okay.

1263
01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.810
I need coffee. Coffee.
Yes. coffee.

1264
01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.123
Mom?

1265
01:04:38.128 --> 01:04:39.212
Kyle!

1266
01:04:39.212 --> 01:04:40.422
You scared me.

1267
01:04:40.422 --> 01:04:42.590
I see you're part
of the night crew.

1268
01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:44.759
I'm ordering Thai.
You want in?

1269
01:04:44.759 --> 01:04:48.221
Sure. Is anyone else
still here?

1270
01:04:48.221 --> 01:04:50.390
No. Just you and me.

1271
01:04:55.562 --> 01:04:57.188
Hey Paula. come on in.

1272
01:04:57.188 --> 01:04:58.064
Hi.

1273
01:05:09.617 --> 01:05:11.077
Of course.

1274
01:05:11.703 --> 01:05:12.871
Something funny?

1275
01:05:12.871 --> 01:05:14.664
Ah... no.
I mean. yes.

1276
01:05:14.664 --> 01:05:17.167
But no.
I just realized something.

1277
01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:20.545
Anyway. thanks for coming.
Did you bring the step data?

1278
01:05:20.545 --> 01:05:24.841
I sure did. Why do you want it?

1279
01:05:24.841 --> 01:05:26.843
I think I might've figured out
a way to prove

1280
01:05:26.843 --> 01:05:28.970
there was foul play
in Tim's death.

1281
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:30.513
Oh! Good.

1282
01:05:30.513 --> 01:05:33.600
Uh... here.

1283
01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.684
Would you like something
to drink?

1284
01:05:34.684 --> 01:05:35.685
Got any bourbon?

1285
01:05:35.685 --> 01:05:37.103
Coming right up.

1286
01:05:55.497 --> 01:05:57.123
I'm sorry to do this to you. Bird.

1287
01:06:03.004 --> 01:06:05.882
They forgot your chicken satay.

1288
01:06:05.882 --> 01:06:10.470
Oh. That is totally fine.
I will survive.

1289
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:11.262
You sure?

1290
01:06:11.262 --> 01:06:12.430
Yup. Yup.

1291
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:13.556
Okay. if you say so.

1292
01:06:15.058 --> 01:06:16.101
Phew.

1293
01:06:16.101 --> 01:06:17.894
How many steps you get
in today?

1294
01:06:17.894 --> 01:06:20.814
Uh... 5.000. and that's
with a morning run.

1295
01:06:20.814 --> 01:06:22.190
How about you?

1296
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:23.525
Uh... let's see.

1297
01:06:23.525 --> 01:06:28.238
22.477.

1298
01:06:28.238 --> 01:06:30.573
How is that possible?

1299
01:06:30.573 --> 01:06:32.367
I'll show you. Okay?

1300
01:06:32.367 --> 01:06:33.785
Check this out.

1301
01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:39.249
Okay. So you can manually enter
your steps on their back end.

1302
01:06:39.249 --> 01:06:40.166
Wait. Are you serious?

1303
01:06:40.166 --> 01:06:41.710
Yeah. Yeah.

1304
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:43.795
I read their terms of service.
it's actually kind of scary.

1305
01:06:43.795 --> 01:06:46.423
They store the GPS history
of every user.

1306
01:06:46.423 --> 01:06:48.842
Like. you wanna see where
everyone is right now?

1307
01:06:48.842 --> 01:06:50.593
That's a complete invasion
of privacy.

1308
01:06:50.593 --> 01:06:51.970
Yeah. Yeah. you're right.

1309
01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:53.471
But I guess since
you're already logged in...

1310
01:06:53.471 --> 01:06:55.724
we can sneak a peek. Right?

1311
01:06:55.724 --> 01:06:56.975
Yeah.

1312
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:04.941
The trick is. the step counter
tracks data using GPS.

1313
01:07:04.941 --> 01:07:07.652
Which means I should be able
to prove unequivocally

1314
01:07:07.652 --> 01:07:09.446
that Tim was actually murdered.

1315
01:07:09.446 --> 01:07:11.406
Wow. Alden!

1316
01:07:12.323 --> 01:07:13.575
You are quite the sleuth.

1317
01:07:13.575 --> 01:07:14.701
Well...

1318
01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:16.745
Have you told
anyone else about this?

1319
01:07:16.745 --> 01:07:18.204
No. No. you're the first.

1320
01:07:18.204 --> 01:07:21.124
Mmm. That's good.

1321
01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:23.710
I really wish you had let
sleeping dogs lie.

1322
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.795
Hey. that's what
the brick said.

1323
01:07:29.466 --> 01:07:30.342
Paula?

1324
01:07:51.863 --> 01:07:53.073
Paula?

1325
01:07:53.073 --> 01:07:55.742
This is very impressive.

1326
01:07:55.742 --> 01:07:57.744
I just wish someone
had spent this much time

1327
01:07:57.744 --> 01:08:00.330
trying to find justice
for my sister. Caroline.

1328
01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:03.333
Justice? Why. what happened?

1329
01:08:03.333 --> 01:08:06.961
What happened?

1330
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:10.507
You are a funny little monkey.
aren't you. Alden?

1331
01:08:10.507 --> 01:08:13.593
Look. Paula. Whatever happened
to your sister Caroline.

1332
01:08:13.593 --> 01:08:15.220
I would've helped. I swear.

1333
01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:16.888
No you wouldn't have!

1334
01:08:16.888 --> 01:08:19.641
You would've been too scared of
Lean McGuiness and his thugs.

1335
01:08:19.641 --> 01:08:22.602
You would've kept your mouth
shut just like everyone else.

1336
01:08:22.602 --> 01:08:24.771
Everyone knew who killed her

1337
01:08:24.771 --> 01:08:27.107
but they didn't do anything
about it.

1338
01:08:27.107 --> 01:08:29.693
She deserves justice.

1339
01:08:29.693 --> 01:08:30.652
Huh?

1340
01:08:32.696 --> 01:08:35.699
You've been on my tail
this whole time.

1341
01:08:35.699 --> 01:08:36.658
I have?

1342
01:08:39.035 --> 01:08:42.747
Oh... I have.

1343
01:08:42.747 --> 01:08:46.292
Because Kyle didn't kill
Lean McGuiness.

1344
01:08:46.292 --> 01:08:48.378
You did.

1345
01:08:48.378 --> 01:08:50.588
And the GPS
would've proven that.

1346
01:08:54.384 --> 01:08:55.218
So. look at this.

1347
01:08:55.218 --> 01:08:56.261
Okay? So that's you and me.

1348
01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:57.554
Okay.

1349
01:08:57.554 --> 01:08:59.472
Uh... that's your mom.

1350
01:08:59.472 --> 01:09:02.267
And... Paula is...

1351
01:09:02.267 --> 01:09:03.601
At my house.
That's weird.

1352
01:09:03.601 --> 01:09:05.061
Yeah.

1353
01:09:05.061 --> 01:09:07.689
Wait. You said they store
people's GPS history. right?

1354
01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:09.107
Mmhmm.

1355
01:09:09.107 --> 01:09:11.818
So can you see where everyone
was the night Tim died?

1356
01:09:11.818 --> 01:09:13.695
Yeah. Yeah. I can.

1357
01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:18.992
Wow. I... I can't believe I
never thought of this before.

1358
01:09:18.992 --> 01:09:20.035
Let's see here.

1359
01:09:22.954 --> 01:09:24.456
That's me finding Tim.

1360
01:09:28.126 --> 01:09:29.502
Wait a second.

1361
01:09:31.296 --> 01:09:34.257
Paula was there too.

1362
01:09:34.257 --> 01:09:37.218
And she's leaving through
the back door.

1363
01:09:37.218 --> 01:09:38.470
Does that mean...

1364
01:09:39.554 --> 01:09:42.057
Paula killed Tim?

1365
01:09:42.057 --> 01:09:43.558
Yeah.

1366
01:09:43.558 --> 01:09:44.976
I think it does.

1367
01:09:46.811 --> 01:09:47.812
Alden.

1368
01:09:48.897 --> 01:09:50.732
Oh my gosh! Alden!

1369
01:09:59.657 --> 01:10:03.620
That's my mom. don't answer.
She is a talker.

1370
01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.831
Oh. Let's let that go
to voicemail.

1371
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:11.461
This is Alden.

1372
01:10:11.461 --> 01:10:12.962
I can't come to
the phone right now.

1373
01:10:12.962 --> 01:10:14.047
Leave a message.

1374
01:10:14.047 --> 01:10:16.716
Alden! Alden! It was Paula
all along.

1375
01:10:16.716 --> 01:10:17.801
Call me.

1376
01:10:17.801 --> 01:10:19.386
Now...

1377
01:10:19.386 --> 01:10:20.970
What to do with you?

1378
01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:22.806
Look. what do you say
you cut me loose.

1379
01:10:22.806 --> 01:10:24.516
we mosey on down
to the Side Saddle.

1380
01:10:24.516 --> 01:10:26.726
we go halfsies on a basket
of jalapeño poppers

1381
01:10:26.726 --> 01:10:29.354
and we just put this whole
thing behind us. Huh?

1382
01:10:29.354 --> 01:10:30.980
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

1383
01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.315
It is!

1384
01:10:32.315 --> 01:10:37.237
That monster killed my sweet
sister 33 years ago.

1385
01:10:37.237 --> 01:10:39.239
She was just walking
home one day.

1386
01:10:39.239 --> 01:10:40.573
took a shortcut down an alley

1387
01:10:40.573 --> 01:10:43.034
and saw something
she shouldn't have.

1388
01:10:43.034 --> 01:10:44.953
And she was gone.

1389
01:10:44.953 --> 01:10:47.372
They found her body
two weeks later.

1390
01:10:47.372 --> 01:10:50.500
Two weeks later!

1391
01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:51.793
I'm really sorry
about your sister

1392
01:10:51.793 --> 01:10:53.169
but you don't have to hurt me.

1393
01:10:53.169 --> 01:10:54.337
I didn't do anything.

1394
01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:55.672
But you did!

1395
01:10:55.672 --> 01:10:57.966
You got in the way!

1396
01:10:57.966 --> 01:11:00.135
I did everyone a favor
by killing Lean.

1397
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:06.224
And now... I have to do
something with you.

1398
01:11:06.224 --> 01:11:07.934
No you don't.
No you don't!

1399
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:11.938
Does Birdie have
any bleach?

1400
01:11:13.898 --> 01:11:14.941
Bleach?

1401
01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:16.484
What's this?

1402
01:11:16.484 --> 01:11:17.777
No. no. no.

1403
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:20.947
Really? Now you're fixing
the street?

1404
01:11:25.285 --> 01:11:28.246
This is not happening. this is
not happening. Okay. Just...

1405
01:11:28.246 --> 01:11:29.414
Hey!

1406
01:11:29.414 --> 01:11:30.540
Hang in there. baby.
Birdie's coming.

1407
01:11:34.044 --> 01:11:37.297
Now that I think about it.
we don't have any bleach.

1408
01:11:37.297 --> 01:11:40.050
We only use Earth friendly
non-toxic cleaning products

1409
01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:41.092
in this house.

1410
01:11:41.092 --> 01:11:42.218
We're on sort of a...
a new green...

1411
01:11:42.218 --> 01:11:43.803
Never mind.

1412
01:11:43.803 --> 01:11:47.390
I found drain cleaner. floor
polish and some laundry pods.

1413
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:50.352
Uh... you know me.
Mr. Curious.

1414
01:11:50.352 --> 01:11:52.145
Why did you have
to kill Tim too?

1415
01:11:52.687 --> 01:11:55.273
I went to the office
to scare Tim

1416
01:11:55.273 --> 01:11:57.942
but he was gonna turn me in.

1417
01:11:57.942 --> 01:12:01.946
So Tim had to be put out
to pasture

1418
01:12:01.946 --> 01:12:05.950
because he figured things out
and wouldn't let it just be.

1419
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:09.913
You all assumed that Tim went
to the apartments by himself.

1420
01:12:09.913 --> 01:12:10.789
Ha!

1421
01:12:10.789 --> 01:12:12.415
I'm always with Tim.

1422
01:12:12.415 --> 01:12:14.501
But nobody ever sees Paula.

1423
01:12:14.501 --> 01:12:18.088
I was with Tim.
like I always was.

1424
01:12:18.088 --> 01:12:22.384
when he went door to door
at the Cecil Bay Apartments.

1425
01:12:22.384 --> 01:12:25.720
And when we went
to apartment 101

1426
01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.306
and Mr. Frederick Gasko
came to the door.

1427
01:12:28.306 --> 01:12:30.934
I knew instantly
who he was.

1428
01:12:30.934 --> 01:12:34.187
This old block of wood
doesn't forget a face.

1429
01:12:34.187 --> 01:12:35.438
So I went back.

1430
01:12:37.774 --> 01:12:40.652
To Mr. Gasko with
my trusty zapper

1431
01:12:40.652 --> 01:12:42.946
and I gave him a send-off
that he deserved.

1432
01:12:44.239 --> 01:12:46.658
I would've said shock
of his life. but...

1433
01:12:46.658 --> 01:12:47.784
no time for humor.

1434
01:12:47.784 --> 01:12:49.452
What are you gonna do with that?

1435
01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:50.495
What are you doing?

1436
01:12:50.495 --> 01:12:51.496
No. no. no.
No. no.

1437
01:12:51.496 --> 01:12:52.706
No. No.

1438
01:12:52.706 --> 01:12:53.748
Take a sip.
You'll go right to sleep.

1439
01:12:53.748 --> 01:12:55.291
Nuh uh.
Oh. that smells terrible.

1440
01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:58.336
You know. we could do this
the easy way or the hard way.

1441
01:12:59.337 --> 01:13:00.380
Look at me.

1442
01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:02.340
Look around you.

1443
01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.926
I'm a 38-year-old private
investigator in training.

1444
01:13:04.926 --> 01:13:07.137
I don't do anything
the easy way.

1445
01:13:07.137 --> 01:13:08.430
Have it your way.

1446
01:13:09.681 --> 01:13:11.016
What does that mean?

1447
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:13.184
Paula. what does that mean?!

1448
01:13:14.936 --> 01:13:17.397
Uh... So... so... so.
you drove to Rhode Island

1449
01:13:17.397 --> 01:13:18.648
with Lean's body
in your car

1450
01:13:18.648 --> 01:13:19.816
and you dumped it at
the construction site

1451
01:13:19.816 --> 01:13:21.484
to make it look like a mob hit.

1452
01:13:21.484 --> 01:13:23.695
But why was Kyle wearing
the T-shirt?

1453
01:13:23.695 --> 01:13:25.530
Kyle's uncle owns
Ado Construction.

1454
01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:27.198
Yeah.

1455
01:13:27.198 --> 01:13:28.450
You'd be hard-pressed
to find a construction site

1456
01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:30.368
in Rhode Island that wasn't done
by them.

1457
01:13:30.368 --> 01:13:31.619
It was a happy accident.

1458
01:13:31.619 --> 01:13:34.539
Oh... Uh huh.

1459
01:13:34.539 --> 01:13:38.126
And. uh... how did Tim
figure it out?

1460
01:13:38.126 --> 01:13:41.004
Tim knew my sister
was killed by Lean McGuiness

1461
01:13:41.004 --> 01:13:44.007
and when they found his body
he put two and two together.

1462
01:13:44.007 --> 01:13:46.926
We were the only people
who knew Lean's hiding place.

1463
01:13:46.926 --> 01:13:49.179
Help me out here.
Any ideas?

1464
01:13:49.179 --> 01:13:50.221
What?

1465
01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:52.849
Man. you're good.

1466
01:13:52.849 --> 01:13:55.435
Tim was gonna go
to the FBI about me.

1467
01:13:55.435 --> 01:13:58.772
and they would've found me.
so he had to be silenced.

1468
01:14:06.196 --> 01:14:07.197
No.

1469
01:14:08.281 --> 01:14:10.033
Yes!

1470
01:14:12.452 --> 01:14:13.453
Help me! Help!

1471
01:14:13.453 --> 01:14:14.621
Help!

1472
01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:15.705
No one is coming
to save you. Alden.

1473
01:14:15.705 --> 01:14:16.664
No. no. no. no. no.

1474
01:14:16.664 --> 01:14:17.749
Help!

1475
01:14:18.875 --> 01:14:21.544
No. no. no. Paula. Paula.

1476
01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:24.673
P...P...P...

1477
01:14:24.673 --> 01:14:25.840
What about Birdie?

1478
01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.883
Think about...
think about Birdie.

1479
01:14:26.883 --> 01:14:28.426
Sweet little...
sweet little Birdie.

1480
01:14:28.426 --> 01:14:29.678
I know. poor Birdie.

1481
01:14:29.678 --> 01:14:31.221
Right?

1482
01:14:31.221 --> 01:14:33.890
Don't worry. I am gonna be there
to help her through this.

1483
01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:35.141
That's not really
what I had in mind.

1484
01:14:35.141 --> 01:14:36.351
And now...

1485
01:14:36.351 --> 01:14:39.479
it's time for heaven
to get another angel.

1486
01:14:39.479 --> 01:14:40.397
Nuh uh.

1487
01:14:40.397 --> 01:14:41.398
- Open up.
- Mm.

1488
01:14:41.398 --> 01:14:43.149
- Mm.
- Open up! Open!

1489
01:14:43.149 --> 01:14:44.776
- Open up.
- Mm.

1490
01:14:44.776 --> 01:14:45.860
- Open up!
- Mm.

1491
01:14:48.905 --> 01:14:49.572
Mm. Mm. Mm...

1492
01:14:49.572 --> 01:14:51.950
- Open up. Alden!
- Mm.

1493
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:52.826
Alden?

1494
01:14:53.368 --> 01:14:54.869
In here!

1495
01:14:54.869 --> 01:14:55.870
Freeze!

1496
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:56.996
Who are you?

1497
01:14:56.996 --> 01:14:58.206
That's Rick.

1498
01:14:58.206 --> 01:15:00.083
Drop the... turkey baster.

1499
01:15:03.294 --> 01:15:04.713
Get her! Get her! Get her!

1500
01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:06.589
Get her!

1501
01:15:07.132 --> 01:15:08.049
Natbot!

1502
01:15:10.051 --> 01:15:10.969
Get her. Rick!

1503
01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:12.303
Got you.

1504
01:15:12.303 --> 01:15:13.221
Get her!

1505
01:15:13.221 --> 01:15:14.180
Let me go!

1506
01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:15.849
Come on. get up.

1507
01:15:15.849 --> 01:15:16.975
- Get her. Rick.
- Get off of me!

1508
01:15:16.975 --> 01:15:18.435
Show her who's boss.
Get her!

1509
01:15:18.435 --> 01:15:20.478
There you go.
You got her.

1510
01:15:20.478 --> 01:15:22.689
We did it!

1511
01:15:23.773 --> 01:15:26.276
I knew it was you in the blue
sedan the whole time.

1512
01:15:26.276 --> 01:15:29.320
Alden! Are you okay?

1513
01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.406
Birdie! Natbot.

1514
01:15:32.407 --> 01:15:33.408
- Alden?
- Birdie!

1515
01:15:33.408 --> 01:15:34.284
Alden?

1516
01:15:35.994 --> 01:15:36.995
Alden?

1517
01:15:36.995 --> 01:15:38.079
Hi honey.

1518
01:15:40.165 --> 01:15:42.083
Tonight. a bizarre ending
to the mystery

1519
01:15:42.083 --> 01:15:44.753
surrounding the fate
of Lean McGuiness.

1520
01:15:44.753 --> 01:15:46.504
We're hearing that
Paula Saint Gervais.

1521
01:15:46.504 --> 01:15:48.465
who's sister.
Caroline Saint Gervais.

1522
01:15:48.465 --> 01:15:51.009
was killed by Lean McGuiness
in 1987...

1523
01:15:51.009 --> 01:15:53.803
Well. I told them all about
the GPS.

1524
01:15:53.803 --> 01:15:55.263
That should seal things up.

1525
01:15:55.263 --> 01:15:56.765
Thanks. man.

1526
01:15:56.765 --> 01:15:59.851
Hey. I'm really glad it was me
you chose to follow.

1527
01:15:59.851 --> 01:16:02.562
Well. yeah.
You did good. glasses.

1528
01:16:03.813 --> 01:16:05.273
Looks like you finally got
your feet wet.

1529
01:16:05.273 --> 01:16:06.775
Thanks Detective.

1530
01:16:07.942 --> 01:16:09.027
- Don't.
- Yeah. it's...

1531
01:16:09.402 --> 01:16:11.029
Yeah. Yeah.

1532
01:16:12.572 --> 01:16:13.782
Did you just make
a new friend?

1533
01:16:13.782 --> 01:16:15.158
I don't know if
I'd go that far.

1534
01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:17.786
Before they take her away.

1535
01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:19.371
there's something
that's been bothering me.

1536
01:16:19.371 --> 01:16:20.372
Wait. What do you mean?

1537
01:16:20.372 --> 01:16:22.499
Officer! Wait. one sec.

1538
01:16:22.499 --> 01:16:24.959
I need to Columbo her.

1539
01:16:24.959 --> 01:16:27.128
Hey Paula. how did
you get Lean's body

1540
01:16:27.128 --> 01:16:28.838
into the car that night?

1541
01:16:28.838 --> 01:16:30.382
I didn't have a plan
for that.

1542
01:16:32.258 --> 01:16:33.677
When I got to
the apartment building

1543
01:16:33.677 --> 01:16:36.012
there was a wheelchair
sitting there.

1544
01:16:36.012 --> 01:16:39.974
Of course! Mrs. Carmopolis'
wheelchair.

1545
01:16:39.974 --> 01:16:41.351
Yes!

1546
01:16:41.351 --> 01:16:46.356
Well. I think we're done here.
Take 'er away. boys.

1547
01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:50.527
I've always wanted
to do that.

1548
01:16:50.527 --> 01:16:52.278
You were made for this.

1549
01:16:59.369 --> 01:17:00.537
I'm so happy to see you.

1550
01:17:00.537 --> 01:17:02.288
I know.

1551
01:17:02.288 --> 01:17:04.541
Authorities aren't releasing
any more details at this time.

1552
01:17:04.541 --> 01:17:07.877
But my sources tell me
the case was solved

1553
01:17:07.877 --> 01:17:12.090
by a local husband and wife
private investigation team.

1554
01:17:13.299 --> 01:17:16.553
So... how does it feel?

1555
01:17:16.553 --> 01:17:18.096
Ah. it's a little sore.

1556
01:17:18.096 --> 01:17:21.016
No. How does it feel
to solve the case?

1557
01:17:21.016 --> 01:17:22.183
Oh...

1558
01:17:22.183 --> 01:17:24.853
I... I can't believe
we solved it.

1559
01:17:24.853 --> 01:17:26.730
- We did it!
- I know.

1560
01:17:29.649 --> 01:17:31.484
Mmm.

1561
01:17:31.484 --> 01:17:32.402
That hits the spot.

1562
01:17:32.402 --> 01:17:33.528
- It's pretty good.
- Mmhmm.

1563
01:17:33.528 --> 01:17:34.863
So tell me...

1564
01:17:35.864 --> 01:17:37.449
When we got married.

1565
01:17:37.449 --> 01:17:40.160
is this what you imagined
your life would be like?

1566
01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.328
Oh. not at all.

1567
01:17:42.328 --> 01:17:43.705
This?

1568
01:17:43.705 --> 01:17:45.206
Way better.

1569
01:17:45.206 --> 01:17:46.541
Hmm.

1570
01:17:46.541 --> 01:17:48.251
'Cause I get to do it with you.

1571
01:17:55.759 --> 01:17:57.385
What's this?

1572
01:17:57.385 --> 01:17:59.512
It was our divorce papers.

1573
01:18:12.650 --> 01:18:14.778
- No more secrets.
- No more secrets.

1574
01:18:31.795 --> 01:18:33.588
I love you. baby bird.

1575
01:18:33.588 --> 01:18:35.298
I love you. big bird.

1576
01:18:42.138 --> 01:18:43.348
Babe. Come on.

1577
01:18:43.348 --> 01:18:44.683
We can't be
late for my mom.

1578
01:18:44.683 --> 01:18:46.017
Well. the door's not
gonna lock itself.

1579
01:18:46.017 --> 01:18:47.769
I know. but you know how
punctual she is.

1580
01:18:47.769 --> 01:18:48.978
Okay? I just...

1581
01:18:48.978 --> 01:18:50.230
I know. I mean.
safety first.

1582
01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:51.481
Are you the Case's?

1583
01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:55.318
Who... who's asking?

1584
01:18:55.318 --> 01:18:57.112
I'm Johnny D'Rossi.

1585
01:18:57.112 --> 01:19:00.448
My family owns the wine
and cheese store on Fifth.

1586
01:19:00.448 --> 01:19:01.741
Mmhmm.

1587
01:19:01.741 --> 01:19:03.451
Oh. You guys have
great pickles.

1588
01:19:03.451 --> 01:19:04.494
Thank you.

1589
01:19:07.372 --> 01:19:09.332
This is for you.

1590
01:19:12.293 --> 01:19:13.336
It's a ham.

1591
01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:15.714
Oh.

1592
01:19:15.714 --> 01:19:16.923
Bone in.

1593
01:19:18.258 --> 01:19:21.302
I spent a lot of years
with Lean McGuiness.

1594
01:19:21.302 --> 01:19:22.303
Too many.

1595
01:19:24.014 --> 01:19:26.099
But his murder had a lot of
people worked up

1596
01:19:26.099 --> 01:19:30.395
and what you did
prevented more bloodshed.

1597
01:19:30.395 --> 01:19:35.233
You ever need a favor.
you come by the store.

1598
01:19:35.233 --> 01:19:37.986
Your husband. he did
a great service.

1599
01:19:37.986 --> 01:19:41.197
Actually. uh...
we're partners.

1600
01:19:41.197 --> 01:19:43.450
Hmm? Oh...

1601
01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:45.368
Well then. you're lucky you
two have found each other.

1602
01:19:45.368 --> 01:19:47.370
Yeah. We are.

1603
01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:56.421
So... was that really Johnny
"Palm Trees" D'Rossi?

1604
01:19:56.421 --> 01:19:57.756
Yup.

1605
01:19:57.756 --> 01:19:59.841
Of the D'Rossi
crime family?

1606
01:19:59.841 --> 01:20:01.426
Mmhmm.

1607
01:20:01.426 --> 01:20:04.137
And the giver of fine hams.

1608
01:20:08.224 --> 01:20:09.392
Oh. this ham's
really heavy.

1609
01:20:09.392 --> 01:20:10.185
Hi.

1610
01:20:10.185 --> 01:20:11.644
Birdie. Alden.

1611
01:20:11.644 --> 01:20:15.023
Mrs. Grant reached out and
wanted to speak to you both.

1612
01:20:15.023 --> 01:20:16.649
What are you holding?

1613
01:20:16.649 --> 01:20:17.609
Mobster ham!

1614
01:20:19.778 --> 01:20:22.614
Oh. Mrs. Grant.
It's nice to see you again.

1615
01:20:22.614 --> 01:20:26.409
I wanted to formally express
my gratitude to you both.

1616
01:20:26.409 --> 01:20:30.246
Tim has considered this firm to
be part of his extended family

1617
01:20:30.246 --> 01:20:34.209
and I am so grateful for your
diligent work to find the truth.

1618
01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:36.670
Well. it's the least
we could do for Tim.

1619
01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:41.216
Because Tim's death has been
reclassified as a homicide.

1620
01:20:41.216 --> 01:20:43.843
his life insurance policy
is no longer void.

1621
01:20:43.843 --> 01:20:46.638
And I think that Timmy
would want you...

1622
01:20:48.431 --> 01:20:49.933
to have this.

1623
01:20:54.896 --> 01:20:56.356
A million dollars?

1624
01:20:56.356 --> 01:20:57.524
It's a $100.000.

1625
01:20:57.524 --> 01:20:58.942
$100.000?!

1626
01:21:00.276 --> 01:21:03.571
This is... I... I don't even...

1627
01:21:03.571 --> 01:21:05.156
Thank you.

1628
01:21:05.156 --> 01:21:07.617
Maybe that will help you get
your investigation business

1629
01:21:07.617 --> 01:21:09.369
off the ground.

1630
01:21:09.369 --> 01:21:12.747
That is so generous.
Thank you very much.

1631
01:21:12.747 --> 01:21:13.957
And I'll be in charge
of the accounting.

1632
01:21:13.957 --> 01:21:15.208
Absolutely.

1633
01:21:16.376 --> 01:21:17.460
Detective.

1634
01:21:18.753 --> 01:21:20.213
Good work you two.

1635
01:21:20.797 --> 01:21:23.466
You know. Penelope was right.

1636
01:21:23.466 --> 01:21:24.801
You keep this going.

1637
01:21:24.801 --> 01:21:26.970
I might have a few clients
to send your way myself.

1638
01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:31.850
Eleonore? Is that actual
approval I'm hearing?

1639
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:33.309
Something like that.

1640
01:21:34.686 --> 01:21:36.104
Hmm.

1641
01:21:36.104 --> 01:21:37.689
So I'll see you tonight?

1642
01:21:37.689 --> 01:21:38.648
Tonight.

1643
01:21:38.648 --> 01:21:39.482
Mmm.

1644
01:21:41.776 --> 01:21:43.319
Can't wait.

1645
01:21:46.489 --> 01:21:48.491
Birdie. One second.

1646
01:21:49.701 --> 01:21:53.955
Penelope was very impressed
with what you and Alden did.

1647
01:21:53.955 --> 01:21:56.499
You two seem... better.

1648
01:21:56.499 --> 01:21:57.667
We are.

1649
01:22:00.003 --> 01:22:03.256
Hey. Mom. I mean... Eleonore.

1650
01:22:03.256 --> 01:22:05.550
I'm sorry that I was so
distracted around here.

1651
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:06.968
No.

1652
01:22:06.968 --> 01:22:09.137
I'm the one that should
be apologizing.

1653
01:22:09.137 --> 01:22:11.556
I can admit that I pushed
you too hard.

1654
01:22:11.556 --> 01:22:14.476
and what I don't wanna do
is push you away.

1655
01:22:16.853 --> 01:22:18.980
I think this is where we hug.

1656
01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.732
Not in the office. dear.

1657
01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:30.617
Missing persons investigations.

1658
01:22:30.617 --> 01:22:31.618
Who...

1659
01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:34.287
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1660
01:22:34.746 --> 01:22:35.872
Oh. hi. Come on in.

1661
01:22:35.872 --> 01:22:37.165
Thanks.

1662
01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:41.252
Mrs. Case.
glad you could make it.

1663
01:22:41.252 --> 01:22:42.212
Hi.

1664
01:22:42.212 --> 01:22:43.838
- Okay...
- Thank you.

1665
01:22:43.838 --> 01:22:46.675
Missing persons investigations.

1666
01:22:46.675 --> 01:22:50.428
Who knows where to start
with something like this?

1667
01:22:56.851 --> 01:22:59.020
I mean. everyone is
saying that Rick is the hero.

1668
01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:00.939
but when you think about it.

1669
01:23:00.939 --> 01:23:02.982
he was just sitting in his car
the whole time.

1670
01:23:02.982 --> 01:23:05.527
Well. I mean. he did kinda...
you know...

1671
01:23:05.527 --> 01:23:07.237
save your life.

1672
01:23:07.237 --> 01:23:08.321
Well...

1673
01:23:11.991 --> 01:23:13.743
Are you
expecting somebody?

1674
01:23:13.743 --> 01:23:15.120
No.

1675
01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:18.581
Hello?

1676
01:23:18.581 --> 01:23:20.208
Mr. And Mrs. Case.

1677
01:23:20.208 --> 01:23:23.461
I got your name
from Penelope Grant.

1678
01:23:23.461 --> 01:23:24.462
I need your help.

1679
01:23:24.462 --> 01:23:26.840
- Of course. Come on in.
- Thanks.

1680
01:23:31.761 --> 01:23:34.889
So... how can we help?

1681
01:23:34.889 --> 01:23:36.474
I don't even know
where to start.
