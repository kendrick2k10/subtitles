Tell the truth.

11
00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.249
You spilled innocent
cranberry juice everywhere.

12
00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:27.382
No. no. it wasn't us.

13
00:01:27.517 --> 00:01:28.483
It wasn't.

14
00:01:28.617 --> 00:01:30.349
Adria did it.

15
00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:32.917
It's Adria who's going
to bed right now.

16
00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:34.349
Aw. no. no. no. no.

17
00:01:34.483 --> 00:01:36.116
We got school
in the morning.
We do?

18
00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:37.817
Yes. Bedtime.

19
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.049
Bedtime. honey.
Hey.

20
00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:40.415
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.116
Are you ready
for the big surprise?

22
00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:46.116
Yeah.

23
00:01:46.483 --> 00:01:47.783
Okay.

24
00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:50.216
The horse is going to bed.
He's falling off the cliff.

25
00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:52.149
Oh. he's falling asleep!

26
00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:53.884
And so are you.

27
00:01:54.016 --> 00:01:55.950
Look into my eyes.

28
00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:59.083
Okay?
Good night. sweetie. okay?

29
00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:01.049
Night-night.
Aww.

30
00:02:09.382 --> 00:02:11.683
My night owl's
flying off again.

31
00:02:14.518 --> 00:02:15.651
Are you ready?

32
00:02:15.784 --> 00:02:17.217
I'm always ready.

33
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.885
Will you be listening tonight?

34
00:02:19.017 --> 00:02:21.851
Well. I think I'd rather
hear about it in the morning.

35
00:02:21.985 --> 00:02:23.818
Okay. at breakfast?

36

00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:46.417
Oh. hey. uh...
I'm sorry. I forgot.

81
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:48.818
Uh... what's your name again?

82
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:51.084
Hemwatinandan Sunderdas.

83
00:04:51.217 --> 00:04:52.417
Uh. can I call you Bob?

84
00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:54.484
Yeah. sure.
Yeah. how's the family?

85
00:04:54.618 --> 00:04:56.818
Oh. they're great.
Thanks for asking. Bob.

86
00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:58.417
You excited about
the show tonight?

87
00:04:58.551 --> 00:05:00.885
Oh. absolutely. Look.
It's the final.

88
00:05:01.017 --> 00:05:02.417
We'll finally get to find out

89
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:05.951
if the New York Newbies beat
the Manchester Magic Voices.

90
00:05:06.084 --> 00:05:08.317
I'm all for Manchester!

91
00:05:08.451 --> 00:05:11.484
It's my hometown.
How about you. sir?

92
00:05:11.618 --> 00:05:13.518
Well. I was talking
about my show. Bob.

93
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:16.217
How do you expect to know what's
happening while I'm on the radio

94
00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:17.618
if you don't even listen?

95
00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:19.551
Oh...

96
00:05:21.084 --> 00:05:23.618
Yep.

97
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:26.751
- You're in the right direction.
- Elvis.

98
00:05:27.384 --> 00:05:28.284
Hey.

99
00:05:30.518 --> 00:05:33.084
Sorry. I'm late.
How are you?

100
00:05:33.217 --> 00:05:34.584
I'm good. thanks.

101
00:05:34.718 --> 00:05:35.751
Do I know you?

102
00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:37.985
Well. that's funny.

103
00:05:38.117 --> 00:05:39.518
Elvis. do you know this man?

104
00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:41.584
Of course he knows me.
Come on. Elvis. let's go.

105
00:05:41.718 --> 00:05:44.050
No. I don't know this guy.
Sir. who are you?

106
00:05:44.185 --> 00:05:46.050
Hey. nobody's talkin'
to you. asshole.

107
00:05:46.185 --> 00:05:47.484
Hey. come on. buddy. let go.

108
00:05:47.618 --> 00:05:49.851
I will let go
once we get in the studio.

109
00:05:49.985 --> 00:05:51.117
Okay. that's enough.

110
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:52.751
You got my hand.
I want it back.

111
00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:54.384
Man. come on!

112
00:05:56.751 --> 00:05:58.217
Uh-oh.

113
00:05:58.351 --> 00:06:01.251
If I say that we have
an appointment.

114
00:06:01.384 --> 00:06:03.618
we have an appointment.

115
00:06:03.751 --> 00:06:05.317
It has to be tonight.

116
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:07.551
I have to announce it tonight.

117
00:06:07.684 --> 00:06:10.718
Okay. whoever you are.
this isn't gonna fly.

118
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:13.851
All right. that's the last time
you pretend not to know me.

119
00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:15.484
Or else...
Or else what?

120
00:06:17.618 --> 00:06:19.118
Whoa. whoa! Hey.

121
00:06:19.252 --> 00:06:20.252
Calm down here.

122
00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:21.585
Or else I kill myself.

123
00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.418
What is it that
you want to announce?

124
00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:26.285
That I'm here.

125
00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:28.719
I-I'm here. I'm...

126
00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:31.152
I'm the Messiah.

127
00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.285
I'm back.

128
00:06:34.418 --> 00:06:36.552
Well. why the hell didn't you
say so in the first place?

129
00:06:36.685 --> 00:06:39.352
It is you. It's him.
How you been?

130
00:06:39.485 --> 00:06:41.785
So you do know him?

131
00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.585
Yes. Obviously. Don't you?

132
00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:47.485
He's... probably a Buddhist.
He's...

133
00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:49.919
I'm a Hindu. actually.
Oh.

134
00:06:50.051 --> 00:06:53.318
Look. We've been waiting
over 2.000 years for you.

135
00:06:53.452 --> 00:06:55.186
Hey. you got
a lot of work to do.

136
00:06:55.318 --> 00:06:59.218
You gotta make the lame walk
and the blind see.

137
00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:00.785
You gotta save the world.

138
00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:05.752
Can we go up and I can announce
that to everybody?

139
00:07:05.886 --> 00:07:07.919
Why announce that
on the radio?

140
00:07:08.952 --> 00:07:11.886
I mean. you'll only reach
a handful of insomniacs.

141
00:07:12.018 --> 00:07:15.252
Nobody listens
to the radio anymore.
especially not at night.

142
00:07:15.385 --> 00:07:17.519
And what's more.
they won't be able to see you.

143
00:07:17.652 --> 00:07:20.252
And if they can't see you.
they may not believe it's you.

144
00:07:20.385 --> 00:07:26.119
For my money. you get
the best bang for your buck
if you go live stream.

145
00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:30.452
There's a camera
on her computer.

146
00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:33.086
Who?

147
00:07:34.352 --> 00:07:37.385
The woman at the center.

148
00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:39.152
What. the center
of the universe. or...?

149
00:07:39.285 --> 00:07:41.752
They... They put me
at the treatment center.

150
00:07:41.886 --> 00:07:45.952
But there's a camera
on her computer.
and I can record myself.

151
00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:49.719
Then I can get
the message out.
Yeah.

152
00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:50.952
You have a great show.

153
00:07:53.152 --> 00:07:54.719
What's your name again. brother?

154
00:07:54.852 --> 00:07:56.652
Hemwatinandan.

155
00:07:57.919 --> 00:07:59.519
Yeah.

156
00:08:03.585 --> 00:08:05.418
I love you. Elvis!

157
00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.385
Thank you.

158
00:08:09.752 --> 00:08:11.052
Fuck.

159
00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:14.585
Lock the door.
and don't let anyone else in.

160
00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:18.218
That shouldn't have happened
in the first place.

161
00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:25.886
<i>It's getting hot in here.</i>

162
00:08:26.018 --> 00:08:29.585
<i>15 minutes before</i>
<i>the wonderful Elvis Cooney.</i>

163
00:08:29.719 --> 00:08:35.719
<i>Enough time to listen together</i>
<i>to this amazing. incredible.</i>
<i>fantastic song.</i>

164
00:08:35.852 --> 00:08:37.952
<i>Oh. you're gonna love it.</i>

165
00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:41.352
Shut up.

166
00:08:44.086 --> 00:08:46.086
Elvis. hi.
Mary.

167
00:08:46.218 --> 00:08:47.819
Man. did you
just roll out of bed?

168
00:08:47.952 --> 00:08:50.752
You look like death warmed up.
I'm not quite warm yet.

169
00:08:50.886 --> 00:08:53.619
Well. anyway. we've got
great callers tonight.

170
00:08:53.752 --> 00:08:54.886
Cool.

171
00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:57.886
And this is
James Steel's biography.

172
00:08:58.019 --> 00:08:59.886
That comedian
who does online videos.

173
00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:01.385
He's got over
two million followers.

174
00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:03.619
and we're gonna
get him on the air.

175
00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:07.152
Thank you.

176
00:09:07.285 --> 00:09:08.752
No problem. it's my job.

177
00:09:10.052 --> 00:09:12.252
No. I mean thank you.

178
00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:14.086
For my birthday.

179
00:09:14.218 --> 00:09:16.552
Oh. sorry. it slipped my mind.

180
00:09:16.685 --> 00:09:18.086
Isn't it tomorrow?

181
00:09:18.218 --> 00:09:21.352
Well. tomorrow's
in about 13 minutes.

182
00:09:22.052 --> 00:09:23.418
That's okay.

183
00:09:23.552 --> 00:09:25.752
Everyone always forgets
my fuckin' birthday.

184
00:09:25.886 --> 00:09:27.719
Happy birthday.

185
00:09:29.685 --> 00:09:32.318
Not yet. in about
12 and a half minutes.

186
00:09:34.318 --> 00:09:35.585
Who's that?

187
00:09:35.719 --> 00:09:37.585
He's the newbie.
just arrived from London.

188
00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:38.953
Long trip to America.

189
00:09:39.086 --> 00:09:40.987
Elvis. this is Dylan.

190
00:09:41.119 --> 00:09:44.285
Dylan. this is Elvis.

191
00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:46.418
Keep your transatlantic germs.
It's okay.

192
00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:48.719
Okay.
You want one of these?

193
00:09:48.852 --> 00:09:51.886
I could make you one
if you'd like.
Uh. no. but thank you.

194
00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:53.218
Mm-hmm.

195
00:09:53.352 --> 00:09:55.685
I was just kidding.
This is for adults.

196
00:09:55.819 --> 00:09:57.152
I am 27.

197
00:09:57.285 --> 00:09:58.619
Don't mind him.

198
00:09:58.752 --> 00:10:00.785
Go to the studio.
Okay.

199
00:10:02.485 --> 00:10:03.585
Oh.

200
00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:05.519
I see Sam is still here.

201
00:10:06.086 --> 00:10:07.418
Yeah.

202
00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:10.719
Should have brought
my rubber gloves.

203
00:10:15.452 --> 00:10:16.385
Hey.

204
00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:18.152
Don't even bother
to knock anymore.

205
00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:20.285
Yeah. just like you don't
even bother to tell me

206
00:10:20.418 --> 00:10:21.953
when you're coming
to watch my show.

207
00:10:22.719 --> 00:10:25.186
What's to watch?
It's a radio show.

208
00:10:25.318 --> 00:10:26.820
You need something?
I'm leaving in a minute.

209
00:10:26.954 --> 00:10:30.419
Oh. well. then why don't we
make this a quality minute?

210
00:10:30.553 --> 00:10:32.820
When was the last time
you stayed this late?

211
00:10:32.954 --> 00:10:34.853
Last year for the sweeps.

212
00:10:34.988 --> 00:10:36.020
Mm-hmm.

213
00:10:36.153 --> 00:10:38.520
Okay. I'll let you guys talk.

214
00:10:39.386 --> 00:10:40.419
Sure.

215
00:10:42.087 --> 00:10:44.219
I'll be listening
to tonight's show in my office.

216
00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:45.486
Oh. thanks. buddy.

217
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.753
Least somebody around here
gives a damn.

218
00:10:50.153 --> 00:10:52.087
Hey. since you're here.

219
00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:56.753
I'm looking
at the quarter numbers.

220
00:10:56.888 --> 00:10:59.153
Whoo! Okay.

221
00:10:59.286 --> 00:11:01.020
You've plateaued.

222
00:11:01.153 --> 00:11:03.020
Your numbers are flat.

223
00:11:03.153 --> 00:11:05.253
Flat as a crepe.

224
00:11:05.386 --> 00:11:07.620
Crepe. crepe? Oh. pancake.
Yeah. that's pretty flat.

225
00:11:07.753 --> 00:11:09.786
But it's just one quarter.
that doesn't mean anything.

226
00:11:09.921 --> 00:11:13.921
I think you have two problems.
Oh. Nobody has
just two problems.

227
00:11:14.053 --> 00:11:16.553
Okay. first. the audience.

228
00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:18.686
They're not interested
in your social media.

229
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.153
Well. and neither am I.

230
00:11:20.286 --> 00:11:22.786
That's why Mary
takes care of it.

231
00:11:22.921 --> 00:11:24.353
Okay.
blame Mary if you want.

232
00:11:24.486 --> 00:11:26.153
Either way. it's a disaster.

233
00:11:26.286 --> 00:11:27.888
Please. not this again.

234
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.020
I'm a radio host.
not a TikTok jock.
Look at your last post.

235
00:11:31.153 --> 00:11:34.353
Three months ago.
and all you said was. "Hey."

236
00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:36.187
with a big shot
of your fucking boots?

237
00:11:36.319 --> 00:11:38.988
They were great.
very cool boots. size 12s.

238
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.586
Oh. gosh.
Okay. look.

239
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.353
I'm the first to admit.
I'm not good at that stuff.

240
00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:45.187
That's not me.
Yeah. we all know that.

241
00:11:45.319 --> 00:11:48.187
But today. radio
is not enough. Okay?

242
00:11:48.319 --> 00:11:50.153
Why don't you just
let me do what I do?

243
00:11:50.286 --> 00:11:52.120
I mean.
let's not rock the boat.

244
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.187
Okay. so you're not
listening to me.

245
00:11:54.319 --> 00:11:57.053
The boat is sinking. Elvis.

246
00:11:58.286 --> 00:12:00.586
What?
You're...

247
00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:02.620
different. somehow different.

248
00:12:02.753 --> 00:12:04.353
What?
Have you done...

249
00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:06.586
You know. you're really
stunningly statuesque.
Can you stop?

250
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.419
Stop. Nice try. though.

251
00:12:08.553 --> 00:12:11.821
Second thing. I think
you're pushing too much.

252
00:12:11.954 --> 00:12:14.620
Now. I've told you before.
you've got a great concept.

253
00:12:14.753 --> 00:12:17.353
Okay? Telling it like it is.
take no mercy.

254
00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:19.686
and all that is
what makes you. I get it.

255
00:12:19.821 --> 00:12:20.753
Yeah.
Yeah.

256
00:12:20.888 --> 00:12:22.053
But there's a pushback now.

257
00:12:22.187 --> 00:12:24.319
Pushback from who?

258
00:12:25.553 --> 00:12:27.153
From the Pope.
Oh. he listens?

259
00:12:27.286 --> 00:12:28.453
Wow. you should get <i>him</i> to call.

260
00:12:28.586 --> 00:12:30.153
I could tell him
how to separate--

261
00:12:30.286 --> 00:12:31.753
Stop. no! Stop.

262
00:12:31.888 --> 00:12:34.653
I think you can afford now
to slow down. you know?

263
00:12:37.988 --> 00:12:38.988
No. you're wrong.

264
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.653
Stop pushing the envelope.

265
00:12:40.787 --> 00:12:43.486
If not. someday the big boss
is going to replace you.

266
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.888
Is that right? Who?

267
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.053
Is that a threat?

268
00:12:47.187 --> 00:12:49.620
No. honey.
it's not a threat.

269
00:12:49.753 --> 00:12:52.586
It's a tip. okay.
from a very good friend.

270
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.187
Now. get out.
Have a good show tonight.

271
00:12:56.319 --> 00:12:59.988
Wow. That was actually...
two quality minutes.

272
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.520
Just... goodbye.

273
00:13:08.553 --> 00:13:11.453
Well. hey!

274
00:13:11.586 --> 00:13:15.486
If it isn't
"the greatest radio host
in the world."

275
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.386
You know.
now that I'm not on the air.

276
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.253
I can tell you how
I really feel about you.

277
00:13:20.386 --> 00:13:21.586
You...

278
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.954
piece of shit.

279
00:13:23.087 --> 00:13:25.053
How you doing. Justin?

280
00:13:25.187 --> 00:13:28.120
Your expression tells me
that you're still having
trouble with those hemorrhoids.

281
00:13:28.253 --> 00:13:31.219
The only pain in the ass
around here is you.

282
00:13:31.954 --> 00:13:34.520
You will never get my show.

283
00:13:34.653 --> 00:13:35.620
Do you hear me?

284
00:13:35.754 --> 00:13:38.520
Listen. You will never.
ever have my show.

285
00:13:38.653 --> 00:13:40.586
But I don't want your show.
Liar!

286
00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:42.653
You were just in there
with Sam asking for it.

287
00:13:42.787 --> 00:13:45.620
Justin. I was not in there
to ask for your show.

288
00:13:45.754 --> 00:13:48.020
Stop! Just stop lying. okay?

289
00:13:48.153 --> 00:13:49.386
Justin.
I don't want your show.

290
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.020
I'm not lying.
I don't want your show.

291
00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.954
You don't?

292
00:13:54.087 --> 00:13:55.988
No. I just want your slot.

293
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.053
It's an entirely
different thing.

294
00:13:58.187 --> 00:14:00.219
Quite frankly.
your show plays shitty music

295
00:14:00.353 --> 00:14:01.787
and you're just there
to tell the time.

296
00:14:01.921 --> 00:14:04.286
They should have called it
"Justin Time." It's torture.

297
00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:05.821
It's like listening
to the local radio

298
00:14:05.954 --> 00:14:09.187
slap bang in the middle of
Squeal-like-a-pig Arkansas.

299
00:14:09.921 --> 00:14:11.253
I'm from Arkansas.

300
00:14:11.386 --> 00:14:13.120
Yeah. that's what I mean.

301
00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:17.553
Fuck you. Elvis.

302
00:14:17.687 --> 00:14:18.687
Thank you.

303
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:20.653
Guys. Guys.
Fuck you!

304
00:14:20.787 --> 00:14:23.653
The snappy comebacks.
How does he do it?

305
00:14:23.787 --> 00:14:26.353
We're live in one minute.
47 seconds.

306
00:14:26.486 --> 00:14:27.353
Dickhead.

307
00:14:27.486 --> 00:14:29.620
And dickhead's on top.

308
00:14:39.021 --> 00:14:40.454
Whoo-hoo.

309
00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.254
<i>Elvis Live. "On the Line."</i>

310
00:14:55.989 --> 00:14:58.454
It's midnight.

311
00:14:58.587 --> 00:14:59.989
The witching hour.

312
00:15:00.121 --> 00:15:03.722
Good morning
to all you night-crawling.
circadian rhythm rejects.

313
00:15:03.855 --> 00:15:07.354
you nocturnal emitters
that I like to call my family.

314
00:15:07.487 --> 00:15:10.254
The studio's filling up.
everybody's getting settled.

315
00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:12.855
and Mary's either manning
the phones or phoning her man.

316
00:15:12.989 --> 00:15:14.320
Which is it. Mary?

317
00:15:14.454 --> 00:15:17.121
You mean which man?
I get around. Elvis.

318
00:15:17.254 --> 00:15:18.755
Yeah. be careful.

319
00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:21.021
You get around too much.
you'll get rounder.

320
00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:23.254
Hi.
We're expecting your calls.

321
00:15:23.387 --> 00:15:25.420
Talk to Elvis live on air

322
00:15:25.554 --> 00:15:28.387
and tell him about all
of your issues and problems.

323
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:30.922
below <i>or</i> above the waist.

324
00:15:31.054 --> 00:15:33.688
Call us at 806-806-TALK.

325
00:15:33.822 --> 00:15:36.989
806-806-8255.

326
00:15:37.121 --> 00:15:38.554
That's right.

327
00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:42.487
And this evening. we've got
a newbie joining the show.

328
00:15:42.622 --> 00:15:43.922
A rookie.

329
00:15:44.788 --> 00:15:47.688
And his name is...
let's have a drumroll...

330
00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:49.154
his name is...

331
00:15:49.287 --> 00:15:50.788
What's your name again?

332
00:15:50.922 --> 00:15:52.188
Dylan.

333
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.487
Dylan. Dylan replaces
our old pal. Turncoat Tom.

334
00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:59.387
who left us for a rival
station. that rat bastard.

335
00:15:59.521 --> 00:16:01.287
You won't betray us like that.
will you. Dill?

336
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.287
Uh. yes. I mean. um. no.
Good evening.

337
00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:06.989
Good evening. everyone.

338
00:16:07.121 --> 00:16:08.855
Oh. God. we got a shy one.

339
00:16:08.989 --> 00:16:10.655
You got stage fright?

340
00:16:10.788 --> 00:16:12.454
No. not at all.

341
00:16:12.588 --> 00:16:15.755
It's just that...
it's a real honor
to be part of this show

342
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:17.454
that has been around
for so long.

343
00:16:17.588 --> 00:16:20.555
I'm... so happy to be here.

344
00:16:22.188 --> 00:16:24.354
"So long"? What are you
trying to say. kid?

345
00:16:24.487 --> 00:16:28.688
That I'm a washed-up.
diaper-wearing has-been.
is that it?

346
00:16:30.454 --> 00:16:31.454
No.

347
00:16:31.588 --> 00:16:33.287
I've been doing this show
for 40 years.

348
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.021
long enough to spot
an elder-abuse asshole
when I see one.

349
00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:39.521
You know. life's too short.

350
00:16:39.655 --> 00:16:41.755
Or in my case too long.
huh. Dylan?

351
00:16:41.889 --> 00:16:43.054
Huh? Hmm?

352
00:16:43.188 --> 00:16:44.521
Get lost. You're fired.

353
00:16:44.655 --> 00:16:47.154
Take a plane. take a boat.
swim the Channel.

354
00:16:47.287 --> 00:16:50.588
Go back to fuckin' England.
or wherever the fuck
you came from.

355
00:16:50.722 --> 00:16:54.088
Go on. Huh.

356
00:16:54.755 --> 00:16:56.088
Why are you smiling?

357
00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.487
You think I'm kidding?
He thinks I'm kidding.

358
00:16:58.622 --> 00:17:01.254
Mary can produce the show.
She's done it a million times.

359
00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:04.522
Get lost. go on.
Out. finished. over.

360
00:17:05.454 --> 00:17:07.588
Now!
What are you waiting for?

361
00:17:07.722 --> 00:17:09.220
Geez.

362
00:17:09.354 --> 00:17:12.054
Okay. bring in the next one.

363
00:17:17.188 --> 00:17:20.121
Well. that didn't
last very long. did it?

364
00:17:20.655 --> 00:17:21.688
I'm kidding.

365
00:17:21.822 --> 00:17:24.287
Oh. Dylan. come on back.
We love you. come on.

366
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.955
I'm just joking. kid.
Come on back.

367
00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:27.320
Get in here.

368
00:17:27.454 --> 00:17:29.454
Look at him.
He looks like he's gonna cry.

369
00:17:31.354 --> 00:17:33.420
Come on. kid.
It's just a joke for the newbie.

370
00:17:33.555 --> 00:17:36.254
Sit down.
We'll have some soft foods.

371
00:17:36.387 --> 00:17:38.387
Yeah. and with a Geritol
as a chaser.

372
00:17:38.522 --> 00:17:40.088
There you go.
There's the spirit.

373
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.287
You just can't help yourself.
Yeah.

374
00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:45.088
All right. people.

375
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.021
Here we go.

376
00:17:47.154 --> 00:17:49.220
Settle in. relax.

377
00:17:49.889 --> 00:17:51.588
Gimme a call.

378
00:17:51.722 --> 00:17:54.054
This is "On the Line."

379
00:17:55.488 --> 00:17:58.688
<i>Talk to Elvis! "On the Line"!</i>

380
00:17:58.822 --> 00:18:01.254
Emma. good evening.
What's on your mind?

381
00:18:01.387 --> 00:18:04.655
<i>Good evening. Elvis.</i>
<i>and the rest of the team.</i>

382
00:18:04.788 --> 00:18:06.354
<i>Um...</i>

383
00:18:06.488 --> 00:18:09.287
<i>Well. two months ago</i>
<i>my husband left me</i>

384
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.722
<i>after 17 years of marriage.</i>

385
00:18:11.855 --> 00:18:13.922
<i>and I'm devastated.</i>

386
00:18:14.088 --> 00:18:16.488
Oh. I'm sorry.
How did that happen?

387
00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:19.354
<i>Well. he was so jealous.</i>

388
00:18:19.488 --> 00:18:21.320
<i>He thought</i>
<i>I was cheating on him.</i>

389
00:18:21.455 --> 00:18:23.722
Ah. I get it. Jealousy.

390
00:18:23.855 --> 00:18:25.522
Sometimes flattering.

391
00:18:25.655 --> 00:18:29.254
Lets us know
we're still desirable.
but too much. eh. not good.

392
00:18:29.387 --> 00:18:32.188
What made him think
you were cheating on him?

393
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.822
<i>Actually. maybe. because...</i>

394
00:18:34.955 --> 00:18:36.555
<i>I</i> was <i>cheating on him.</i>

395
00:18:37.989 --> 00:18:39.789
Well.
that explains the jealousy.

396
00:18:40.456 --> 00:18:42.189
Look. we're only human.

397
00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:44.022
Seventeen years
of marriage. wow.

398
00:18:44.155 --> 00:18:46.422
I guess he's. uh...
I guess he's hurt.

399
00:18:46.556 --> 00:18:48.388
Might be tough to get him back.

400
00:18:48.523 --> 00:18:52.689
Uh. you know.
you guys should talk about
why you think it happened.

401
00:18:52.823 --> 00:18:56.355
I'm sure it's not because
he's left a wet towel
on the bed or something.

402
00:18:56.489 --> 00:18:57.990
<i>Yeah.</i>

403
00:18:58.122 --> 00:18:59.388
If you still love each other.

404
00:18:59.523 --> 00:19:01.556
and. you know.
perhaps he still does.

405
00:19:01.689 --> 00:19:04.823
um... it's worth having
another crack at it.

406
00:19:04.956 --> 00:19:06.089
it's worth working.

407
00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:07.890
I mean. you should do
whatever it takes.

408
00:19:08.022 --> 00:19:10.221
whatever it takes
to fix it. okay?

409
00:19:10.355 --> 00:19:11.589
Be honest. be open.

410
00:19:12.923 --> 00:19:14.022
<i>Okay.</i>
Right?

411
00:19:14.155 --> 00:19:15.523
<i>Yeah. thank you.</i>

412
00:19:15.656 --> 00:19:17.389
Matt. I'm sorry
to disagree with you.

413
00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:20.689
He's a great player
but a bad sport.

414
00:19:20.823 --> 00:19:21.890
I never liked him.

415
00:19:22.022 --> 00:19:23.656
I've got some bad news.

416
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:26.022
We were supposed to get
James Steel on the line.

417
00:19:26.155 --> 00:19:27.556
Oh.
But his manager just told me

418
00:19:27.689 --> 00:19:29.422
that he's tied up
shooting a video.

419
00:19:29.556 --> 00:19:32.355
and there are some issues
that need his attention.

420
00:19:32.489 --> 00:19:33.756
Fuck.

421
00:19:34.589 --> 00:19:37.321
Tell him to go jump
off a fucking cliff.

422
00:19:37.456 --> 00:19:39.823
with sharpened wooden stakes
on the bottom so he lands...

423
00:19:39.956 --> 00:19:41.356
I hate these new
Internet stars

424
00:19:41.489 --> 00:19:44.155
that make three videos
in their mom's basement

425
00:19:44.288 --> 00:19:47.089
and suddenly they think
they're Bouncy Knowles.

426
00:19:47.723 --> 00:19:48.422
Beyoncé?

427
00:19:48.556 --> 00:19:50.456
Well. she's bouncy to me.

428
00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:53.055
That guy's stuck at a shoot
at 1:00 in the morning

429
00:19:53.189 --> 00:19:54.623
when he's supposed to be
calling us?

430
00:19:54.756 --> 00:19:55.956
I call bullshit.

431
00:19:56.089 --> 00:19:57.723
He's probably home
playing video games.

432
00:19:57.856 --> 00:19:59.321
speed bagging the pickle.

433
00:19:59.456 --> 00:20:01.122
You remember this guy's name?

434
00:20:01.255 --> 00:20:03.189
James Steel. He's a star.

435
00:20:03.321 --> 00:20:05.489
Dylan. you know
who I'm talking about. right?

436
00:20:05.623 --> 00:20:07.155
I'm... not sure.

437
00:20:07.288 --> 00:20:08.589
Yes. he's an asshole.

438
00:20:08.723 --> 00:20:10.255
and we'll never mention
his name again. okay?

439
00:20:10.389 --> 00:20:12.422
Who are we talking about?
Yeah. you're learning.

440
00:20:12.556 --> 00:20:14.623
Okay. we got Gary on the line.

441
00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:16.422
What say you. Gary?

442
00:20:20.823 --> 00:20:22.122
Gary. you with us?

443
00:20:25.456 --> 00:20:26.288
Gary?

444
00:20:31.122 --> 00:20:33.322
Uh-oh. we got a breather.

445
00:20:34.356 --> 00:20:36.322
What are you wearing. Gary?

446
00:20:36.456 --> 00:20:38.523
Hey. Dylan.
you asleep at the wheel?

447
00:20:38.656 --> 00:20:41.221
Can you get Gary through to us?
He's on.

448
00:20:42.389 --> 00:20:43.656
<i>I'm here.</i>

449
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:47.022
Ah. there he is.

450
00:20:47.856 --> 00:20:49.756
How you doing. Gary?

451
00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.623
<i>I'm not doing so hot. Elvis.</i>

452
00:20:52.589 --> 00:20:54.789
What. tonsillitis.
athlete's foot?

453
00:20:54.923 --> 00:20:56.689
Tell me more.

454
00:20:58.823 --> 00:21:01.289
<i>I'm gonna do something</i>
<i>really screwed up tonight.</i>

455
00:21:01.422 --> 00:21:03.589
Suicide.

456
00:21:06.189 --> 00:21:07.723
All right. Gary. listen.

457
00:21:07.856 --> 00:21:10.289
All's well. We're here for you.
We're like family.

458
00:21:10.422 --> 00:21:12.756
Family that isn't fucked up.
You know that. right?

459
00:21:13.823 --> 00:21:15.221
Now. where are you right now?

460
00:21:18.322 --> 00:21:20.055
<i>I'm sorry. this was a bad idea.</i>

461
00:21:20.189 --> 00:21:21.956
Gary. Shit. Mary. call him back.

462
00:21:22.089 --> 00:21:25.456
Okay. well.
we'll try and get Gary back
on the line very quickly

463
00:21:25.589 --> 00:21:27.256
to understand
what's going on with him.

464
00:21:27.389 --> 00:21:29.656
and in the meantime.
we'll take more calls.

465
00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:34.322
<i>So. I have this central</i>
<i>erotic dream with my boss</i>

466
00:21:34.456 --> 00:21:36.221
<i>and I'm a little bit</i>
<i>confused. okay.</i>

467
00:21:36.356 --> 00:21:40.322
<i>because today he told me that</i>
<i>he had the same dream as me.</i>

468
00:21:40.456 --> 00:21:41.789
What do you do for work?

469
00:21:41.923 --> 00:21:44.356
<i>I work for a mattress company.</i>

470
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.122
He wants to test-drive the bed.

471
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:50.723
Yeah. so when I was a kid.

472
00:21:50.856 --> 00:21:52.656
I was terrified of clowns.

473
00:21:53.723 --> 00:21:58.189
You know. so when I grew up.
I decided to face my fears.

474
00:21:58.322 --> 00:22:02.055
And one day.
I slept with a female clown.

475
00:22:02.189 --> 00:22:04.556
Red hair. Big shoes.

476
00:22:04.689 --> 00:22:06.723
Wouldn't take her nose off.
It was weird.

477
00:22:06.856 --> 00:22:08.189
Hmm.

478
00:22:09.222 --> 00:22:11.789
I woke up the next morning
alone. and. uh.

479
00:22:12.523 --> 00:22:14.890
she'd twisted my penis
into a poodle.

480
00:22:15.022 --> 00:22:17.789
Whoa!

481
00:22:20.422 --> 00:22:22.222
We gotta fix this problem.

482
00:22:22.356 --> 00:22:26.756
I mean. how can 11 laptops
magically disappear
in the space of three months?

483
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.089
We're in a radio station.
cameras everywhere.

484
00:22:29.222 --> 00:22:30.890
This is dickin' rifuckulous.

485
00:22:31.022 --> 00:22:33.990
Probably just some dude
trying to build his collection.

486
00:22:34.122 --> 00:22:35.923
Or collect what he can
from the building.

487
00:22:36.055 --> 00:22:38.022
It's kind of hard to describe.

488
00:22:39.322 --> 00:22:42.623
Somewhere between a bald eagle
and a spotted owl.

489
00:22:42.756 --> 00:22:45.389
Who hasn't tried
a little endangered species?

490
00:22:45.523 --> 00:22:49.156
<i>Elvis is on</i>
<i>KLAT-FM Los Angeles.</i>

491
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.657
<i>Live "On the Line."</i>

492
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.423
Okay. good news.
Gary's back on the air.

493
00:22:56.557 --> 00:22:58.657
We were worried about you. pal.
How you feelin'?

494
00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.490
<i>I'm better.</i>

495
00:23:00.991 --> 00:23:02.090
All right.

496
00:23:02.223 --> 00:23:04.191
Um. where are you?

497
00:23:04.323 --> 00:23:06.023
<i>I'm... I'm in Pasadena.</i>

498
00:23:06.157 --> 00:23:08.790
Cool. Pasadena. You alone?

499
00:23:08.924 --> 00:23:11.223
<i>Look. I'm just gonna</i>
<i>do what needs to be done.</i>

500
00:23:11.357 --> 00:23:12.524
<i>It's better that way.</i>

501
00:23:12.657 --> 00:23:14.390
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
Gary. hold on.

502
00:23:14.524 --> 00:23:16.123
Gimme a minute. Let's talk.

503
00:23:16.257 --> 00:23:17.924
I love Pasadena.

504
00:23:18.056 --> 00:23:20.257
Where exactly are you?

505
00:23:23.191 --> 00:23:24.590
Gary. you there?

506
00:23:25.924 --> 00:23:27.423
<i>I'm in a garden.</i>

507
00:23:27.924 --> 00:23:29.957
Okay. in a garden.

508
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:33.757
Is it. uh... your garden?
Are you at home?

509
00:23:34.924 --> 00:23:35.857
<i>No.</i>

510
00:23:35.991 --> 00:23:37.423
No. Uh...

511
00:23:37.557 --> 00:23:40.023
Does the home belong
to someone you know?

512
00:23:40.157 --> 00:23:42.090
<i>No.</i>

513
00:23:42.223 --> 00:23:44.423
<i>It belongs to a piece of shit.</i>

514
00:23:44.557 --> 00:23:45.724
<i>I'm gonna destroy him.</i>

515
00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:47.157
Call the police.

516
00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.157
Gary. tell me. is it the home
of a family member.

517
00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:51.724
a neighbor. a colleague. a...

518
00:23:51.857 --> 00:23:53.290
<i>I told you...</i>
...ex-lover?

519
00:23:53.423 --> 00:23:55.223
<i>...it's a worthless</i>
<i>piece of shit's place.</i>

520
00:23:55.357 --> 00:23:56.624
Right.
<i>And I'm...</i>

521
00:23:56.757 --> 00:23:58.790
<i>I'm gonna take out</i>
<i>his whole family.</i>

522
00:24:00.524 --> 00:24:01.957
Gary. come on.

523
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:03.991
Why hurt his family
If <i>he's</i> a worthless
piece of shit?

524
00:24:04.124 --> 00:24:05.757
I mean. they're innocent.

525
00:24:05.891 --> 00:24:08.457
Don't let your instinct
for revenge drive you
to do something

526
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.924
that you'll probably
be paying for
the rest of your life.

527
00:24:13.157 --> 00:24:15.056
You're better than that. Gary.

528
00:24:15.191 --> 00:24:19.323
Tell me calmly.
what's this guy done to you
to make you so upset?

529
00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:21.657
Some injustice.
some hurt. some...?

530
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.991
<i>He destroyed my life.</i>
<i>and I'm gonna destroy his.</i>

531
00:24:25.124 --> 00:24:27.457
<i>Ay. ay. ay.</i>
an eye for an eye.

532
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:31.457
Gary. you're playing a game
called "You Lose." all right?

533
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.891
Now. whoever he is.
he didn't destroy your life.

534
00:24:35.023 --> 00:24:36.891
Don't give him that power.

535
00:24:37.023 --> 00:24:38.290
You know?

536
00:24:38.423 --> 00:24:39.957
People come
on this show every day

537
00:24:40.091 --> 00:24:41.624
that feel desperate.
hopeless. worthless.

538
00:24:41.757 --> 00:24:44.423
usually because somebody else
made them feel that way. okay?

539
00:24:44.557 --> 00:24:47.991
Do not adopt that perception
of yourself. all right?

540
00:24:48.991 --> 00:24:52.323
You got the power to change.
you got the tools inbuilt.

541
00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:55.124
You gotta believe that. Gary.
You can do it.

542
00:24:55.257 --> 00:24:58.824
Gary. what was that?

543
00:24:58.957 --> 00:25:01.223
<i>I'm breaking into</i>
<i>the son of a bitch's house!</i>

544
00:25:01.357 --> 00:25:02.957
Gary. stop. wait. listen.

545
00:25:03.091 --> 00:25:06.057
If you want. we can chat
about this offline.

546
00:25:06.191 --> 00:25:07.924
I mean. we can. you know...
Cool?

547
00:25:08.057 --> 00:25:10.924
<i>No. I wanna stay on the air.</i>
I'll put on a record. I swear.

548
00:25:11.057 --> 00:25:13.657
<i>I want everyone to hear</i>
<i>what's going down.</i>

549
00:25:14.757 --> 00:25:16.590
I can't keep you on the air.
I'm sorry.

550
00:25:16.724 --> 00:25:18.991
Let's chat offline.
I promise you.
together we can fix it.

551
00:25:19.124 --> 00:25:20.857
<i>No!</i>
<i>Do not cut me off the air.</i>

552
00:25:20.991 --> 00:25:23.423
<i>or I'll go upstairs</i>
<i>and I'll kill everybody.</i>

553
00:25:24.223 --> 00:25:25.390
You're not gonna
kill anyone.

554
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:28.357
All right?
Everything's gonna be fine.

555
00:25:29.223 --> 00:25:30.357
You're still live on air.

556
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.157
but I don't want you
to be in danger

557
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.390
or put anyone else
in danger. okay?

558
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.423
Now. what part
of Pasadena are you in?

559
00:25:40.223 --> 00:25:41.824
<i>Near Arlington Gardens.</i>

560
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:44.790
Ah. Well. yeah. nice area.

561
00:25:44.924 --> 00:25:48.057
<i>Yeah. it's a neighborhood</i>
<i>you know all too well</i>

562
00:25:48.191 --> 00:25:51.024
<i>'cause I'm at your house.</i>

563
00:25:52.323 --> 00:25:54.924
<i>976 Orange Grove Boulevard.</i>

564
00:25:55.057 --> 00:25:58.124
<i>It's crazy</i>
<i>what a nice house you can buy</i>

565
00:25:58.257 --> 00:26:00.891
<i>when you host a shitty show</i>
<i>like yours!</i>

566
00:26:01.824 --> 00:26:03.690
Gary. I don't know if this
is some kind of joke.

567
00:26:03.824 --> 00:26:06.057
I mean. I got nothing
to hide from my listeners.

568
00:26:06.191 --> 00:26:08.624
Yes. that is my address.

569
00:26:08.757 --> 00:26:12.257
But I think you're gonna
have a little trouble
getting across the garden.

570
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.757
<i>Oh. you're talking about</i>
<i>the two mangy Dobermans?</i>

571
00:26:14.891 --> 00:26:17.057
<i>Listen. buddy...</i>

572
00:26:17.191 --> 00:26:21.091
<i>This afternoon. I threw them</i>
<i>a couple pieces of meat</i>
<i>with rat poison.</i>

573
00:26:21.223 --> 00:26:23.223
<i>I thought I might</i>
<i>have to fight them off</i>
<i>a little bit tonight.</i>

574
00:26:23.357 --> 00:26:26.457
<i>but what do you know.</i>
<i>when I got here they were just</i>
<i>lying on the ground.</i>

575
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:29.191
<i>I was. uh. kind enough</i>
<i>to relieve their suffering</i>

576
00:26:29.323 --> 00:26:31.124
<i>with a butcher's knife.</i>

577
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:41.357
- Call 911.
- Yeah.

578
00:26:43.524 --> 00:26:46.257
If that's true.
and you're really at my house.

579
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.257
we'll continue
this conversation offline.

580
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.223
Off the air.
The police will be there
in a minute--

581
00:26:50.357 --> 00:26:54.224
<i>I don't give a fuck</i>
<i>about the cops.</i>
<i>and you better not cut me off.</i>

582
00:26:54.358 --> 00:26:55.725
Gary. Hold on a second.
<i>Don't cut me off!</i>

583
00:26:55.858 --> 00:26:57.224
<i>Don't you dare!</i>
Dylan. music. music.

584
00:26:57.358 --> 00:26:58.758
Dylan. wake up!
Put on a fucking song!

585
00:26:58.892 --> 00:27:00.691
<i>Don't cut me off!</i>
I have no choice. Gary.

586
00:27:00.825 --> 00:27:03.025
- We can't let you...
<i>- Daddy!</i>

587
00:27:05.725 --> 00:27:07.224
Adria?

588
00:27:10.625 --> 00:27:12.525
<i>I should have given her</i>
<i>rat poison. too.</i>

589
00:27:12.658 --> 00:27:15.591
<i>but I wanted her</i>
<i>to be part of the fun.</i>

590
00:27:15.725 --> 00:27:17.358
Listen. it's over.

591
00:27:17.491 --> 00:27:20.192
The police
will be there in a minute.
Leave my daughter alone.

592
00:27:21.525 --> 00:27:23.458
It's not too late.
I won't press charges.
I promise.

593
00:27:23.591 --> 00:27:25.025
I just want you
to get some help.

594
00:27:25.158 --> 00:27:26.224
The police are on their way.

595
00:27:26.358 --> 00:27:28.058
<i>Tell the cops to stay outside.</i>

596
00:27:28.192 --> 00:27:30.391
<i>We don't need them</i>
<i>for the show.</i>

597
00:27:31.458 --> 00:27:33.158
There is no show. Gary.

598
00:27:33.291 --> 00:27:36.158
The reality is.
the police will take you out
if you don't comply.

599
00:27:36.291 --> 00:27:39.092
Now. I won't press charges.
I just want you
to leave my fam--

600
00:27:42.658 --> 00:27:45.691
Gary. what was that?
What the fuck's happening?
Holy shit. what...

601
00:27:45.825 --> 00:27:46.758
<i>Honey...</i>

602
00:27:46.893 --> 00:27:48.491
Oh... Olivia?

603
00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:50.591
<i>Elvis.</i>
Baby. you all right?

604
00:27:50.725 --> 00:27:53.158
<i>Do as he says. please.</i>
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

605
00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:56.291
<i>He just fired shots</i>
<i>into the fucking wall!</i>

606
00:27:56.424 --> 00:28:00.224
<i>Yeah. you'll have</i>
<i>to touch up the paint</i>
<i>a little bit. sorry.</i>

607
00:28:00.358 --> 00:28:01.926
<i>That was just</i>
<i>to shut your trap.</i>

608
00:28:02.058 --> 00:28:04.691
<i>Next time. I'm gonna aim for</i>
<i>your daughter and your wife.</i>

609
00:28:04.825 --> 00:28:07.125
The police are there.
They're waiting for backup.

610
00:28:07.258 --> 00:28:08.558
Try to buy some time.
Okay.

611
00:28:08.691 --> 00:28:09.591
Yep.

612
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:14.192
Gary. I'm listening. Okay?

613
00:28:15.058 --> 00:28:16.658
Tell me what's going on?

614
00:28:17.391 --> 00:28:19.324
Tell me what
you're pissed about.

615
00:28:19.458 --> 00:28:22.058
I mean. clearly.
I don't know you. but...

616
00:28:22.192 --> 00:28:25.859
you're obviously
very angry with me
and I need to know why.

617
00:28:25.993 --> 00:28:28.458
I mean.
maybe we can settle this.

618
00:28:29.558 --> 00:28:30.993
Did I give you some bad advice?

619
00:28:31.125 --> 00:28:33.192
Did I give bad advice
to someone you know?

620
00:28:33.324 --> 00:28:35.391
You blame me for something?
I mean. what is it about?

621
00:28:35.525 --> 00:28:38.058
Is it about a girl?
Did I tell her to leave you?

622
00:28:38.192 --> 00:28:39.691
Something to do with your job?

623
00:28:39.826 --> 00:28:43.025
Listen. you got the air
all to yourself. okay?

624
00:28:43.158 --> 00:28:44.424
So just off-load.

625
00:28:44.558 --> 00:28:47.125
'cause I gotta know
why it is you hate me.

626
00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:50.525
<i>Ahh. Elvis.</i>

627
00:28:50.658 --> 00:28:52.491
<i>You know. I'm embarrassed</i>
<i>to talk about this</i>

628
00:28:52.625 --> 00:28:54.658
<i>in front of your wife</i>
<i>and your daughter.</i>

629
00:28:54.791 --> 00:28:58.324
<i>but since you insist.</i>
<i>it might have something</i>
<i>to do with the fact</i>

630
00:28:58.458 --> 00:29:02.391
<i>that you're sleeping</i>
<i>with your fucking</i>
<i>switchboard operator.</i>

631
00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:07.525
Gary. have you been drinking
or are you on
some kind of drugs?

632
00:29:07.658 --> 00:29:09.291
'Cause I... I don't know you.

633
00:29:09.424 --> 00:29:11.092
You don't know me.
Mary doesn't know...

634
00:29:11.224 --> 00:29:13.058
You know this guy?

635
00:29:14.658 --> 00:29:16.092
Who are you. Gary?

636
00:29:16.224 --> 00:29:19.258
Are you a fan of the show
just trying to create
some kind of buzz.

637
00:29:19.391 --> 00:29:21.324
some sort of prank?

638
00:29:21.458 --> 00:29:22.959
Well. congratulations.
It's working.

639
00:29:23.092 --> 00:29:24.625
You got me. okay?

640
00:29:24.758 --> 00:29:27.192
I'm scared to fucking death.
man. honestly.

641
00:29:27.324 --> 00:29:28.893
Now. look.
you've had your laughs--

642
00:29:29.025 --> 00:29:31.158
<i>Stop fucking around.</i>
<i>shit brain.</i>

643
00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:32.691
<i>You think I actually</i>
<i>listen to your show</i>

644
00:29:32.826 --> 00:29:35.058
<i>for insomniac freaks</i>
<i>who call up...</i>

645
00:29:35.192 --> 00:29:37.525
Okay.
<i>...for your shitty advice?</i>

646
00:29:37.658 --> 00:29:39.959
Calm down. now.
What do you want?

647
00:29:40.759 --> 00:29:42.759
Nobody wants anybody
to get hurt. okay?

648
00:29:42.893 --> 00:29:45.926
<i>Don't talk to me</i>
<i>like I'm one of</i>
<i>your airhead listeners.</i>

649
00:29:46.058 --> 00:29:49.491
<i>I wanna ruin your life.</i>
<i>just like you ruined mine.</i>

650
00:29:50.759 --> 00:29:51.725
Gary. is it money?

651
00:29:51.859 --> 00:29:53.192
Is that what it is?

652
00:29:53.324 --> 00:29:54.792
It's all about money?
You need money?

653
00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:56.826
<i>Money?</i>

654
00:29:56.959 --> 00:29:58.391
<i>Seriously.</i>
<i>if I wanted money.</i>

655
00:29:58.525 --> 00:30:01.859
<i>I'd just help myself</i>
<i>to your yuppie suburban palace.</i>

656
00:30:01.993 --> 00:30:03.491
<i>Oh. uh. wait a second.</i>

657
00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:05.658
<i>I think your wife</i>
<i>wants to talk to you.</i>

658
00:30:05.792 --> 00:30:08.859
<i>How did we</i>
<i>get into this mess. Elvis?</i>

659
00:30:08.993 --> 00:30:10.358
<i>What the hell did you do?</i>

660
00:30:10.491 --> 00:30:12.358
<i>I'm gonna put you</i>
<i>on speakerphone</i>

661
00:30:12.491 --> 00:30:14.358
<i>'cause I wanna hear</i>
<i>how the greatest bigmouth</i>

662
00:30:14.491 --> 00:30:16.224
<i>in the world of radio</i>
<i>handles this.</i>

663
00:30:16.358 --> 00:30:20.491
<i>Careful. though: if you lie.</i>
<i>boom. I will shoot somebody.</i>

664
00:30:23.792 --> 00:30:27.792
<i>Oh. no. Elvis.</i>
<i>you do not have the right</i>
<i>to remain silent.</i>

665
00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:29.658
<i>We're all listening.</i>

666
00:30:29.792 --> 00:30:33.691
<i>Your affair with Mary:</i>
<i>true or false?</i>

667
00:30:39.792 --> 00:30:43.192
Gary. I don't know
what makes you think

668
00:30:43.324 --> 00:30:44.658
that there's a relationship
with Mary.

669
00:30:44.792 --> 00:30:46.658
because I swear to God.
I never--

670
00:30:46.792 --> 00:30:50.358
<i>- Bullshit!</i>
<i>- Stop fucking around. Elvis!</i>

671
00:30:50.491 --> 00:30:51.826
<i>I swore that</i>
<i>I would shoot someone.</i>

672
00:30:51.959 --> 00:30:54.826
<i>Olivia. can you confirm</i>
<i>that I shot someone?</i>

673
00:30:57.025 --> 00:30:58.058
<i>Elvis.</i>

674
00:30:58.192 --> 00:31:00.793
<i>I shot at your ugly face</i>

675
00:31:00.927 --> 00:31:03.392
<i>on that narcissistic poster</i>
<i>hanging on the wall.</i>

676
00:31:03.526 --> 00:31:04.827
<i>The next time...</i>
Good one. Gary.

677
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.159
<i>...next time...</i>

678
00:31:06.292 --> 00:31:07.827
<i>Leave her alone!</i>

679
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.359
<i>Please. I'm begging you!</i>
<i>I'm begging you. please!</i>

680
00:31:10.492 --> 00:31:12.292
<i>Don't hurt her!</i>
Gary? Gary.

681
00:31:12.425 --> 00:31:14.325
I want you to take a minute--

682
00:31:14.459 --> 00:31:17.392
<i>Listen.</i>
<i>I want you to hear this.</i>

683
00:31:21.126 --> 00:31:25.793
<i>That's my gun pressed</i>
<i>against your daughter's temple.</i>

684
00:31:25.927 --> 00:31:28.793
<i>So. how about you tell us</i>
<i>the fucking truth?</i>

685
00:31:30.325 --> 00:31:32.793
<i>Are you screwing</i>
<i>the switchboard operator?</i>

686
00:31:32.927 --> 00:31:33.960
<i>Yes or no?</i>

687
00:31:44.325 --> 00:31:45.960
Yes. Yes. okay.

688
00:31:46.093 --> 00:31:47.760
There you go. yes. I did it.

689
00:31:47.894 --> 00:31:50.392
You're right. I did it.
I screwed her. You happy now?

690
00:31:50.526 --> 00:31:54.026
You win. Now. let her go.
Please.

691
00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:56.193
<i>Thank you.</i>

692
00:31:56.325 --> 00:31:59.159
<i>That wasn't so hard. was it?</i>

693
00:32:00.425 --> 00:32:02.425
You wanted me to confess.
I did.

694
00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:04.927
Now. what more
do you want me to do. huh?

695
00:32:05.492 --> 00:32:06.693
Let's get this over with.

696
00:32:06.827 --> 00:32:08.994
You're angry at me.
not them. all right?

697
00:32:09.126 --> 00:32:11.259
Me. Let them go.

698
00:32:11.392 --> 00:32:13.627
and we can settle this
between the two of us.
all right?

699
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.325
<i>Ah. so now you have time</i>
<i>to listen to me.</i>

700
00:32:16.459 --> 00:32:19.292
The police want to talk to him.
No. no. that's okay.

701
00:32:19.425 --> 00:32:23.660
Gary. this can still
end well. okay?

702
00:32:24.827 --> 00:32:27.292
<i>But I don't want it</i>
<i>to end well.</i>

703
00:32:28.059 --> 00:32:30.159
<i>It didn't end well for Lauren.</i>

704
00:32:30.727 --> 00:32:31.727
For who? Who?

705
00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.425
<i>And you have the balls</i>
<i>to ask me who.</i>

706
00:32:34.994 --> 00:32:36.459
<i>Don't you know a Lauren?</i>

707
00:32:37.459 --> 00:32:40.225
First it's Mary.
now you're talking
about some Lauren.

708
00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:41.660
I know a dozen Laurens.

709
00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:44.159
<i>Oh. I bet you know</i>
<i>about a dozen Laurens.</i>

710
00:32:44.292 --> 00:32:46.292
<i>But to me there's only one.</i>

711
00:32:49.225 --> 00:32:51.159
Gary. you're gonna
have to help me here. I...

712
00:32:51.292 --> 00:32:53.259
They want to
take over the negotiation.

713
00:32:53.392 --> 00:32:55.560
They want you to hang up.
It's okay. Steven.

714
00:32:55.693 --> 00:32:58.325
Please. let my wife
and daughter go.

715
00:32:58.459 --> 00:33:00.793
and then we can talk about.
like. whatever you want.

716
00:33:00.927 --> 00:33:03.526
Okay? We'll sit here
and we'll work this out.

717
00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.193
<i>I'm sorry. that's not</i>
<i>the ending I had in mind.</i>

718
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.793
<i>Wonder.</i>

719
00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.026
What? W-Wonder what?

720
00:33:16.159 --> 00:33:18.292
<i>Wonder. Lauren Wonder!</i>

721
00:33:18.425 --> 00:33:20.425
<i>That's her name!</i>

722
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.459
<i>And she's also the eighth</i>
<i>wonder of the world.</i>

723
00:33:23.593 --> 00:33:27.225
<i>But I bet you didn't even know</i>
<i>her last name. did you?</i>

724
00:33:29.126 --> 00:33:31.627
Before me. Before me.

725
00:33:32.492 --> 00:33:33.359
Oh.

726
00:33:33.492 --> 00:33:35.994
Oh. the switchboard operator.
Lily.

727
00:33:36.126 --> 00:33:38.492
Her real name was Lauren.
We called her Lily.

728
00:33:38.627 --> 00:33:39.994
I didn't know her last name.

729
00:33:40.126 --> 00:33:41.660
<i>There you go.</i>

730
00:33:41.793 --> 00:33:44.960
<i>It's funny how</i>
<i>it all comes rushing back.</i>

731
00:33:45.093 --> 00:33:47.225
Yeah. She worked for us
a couple months.

732
00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:49.359
Uh. two years back.
She disappeared one day.

733
00:33:49.492 --> 00:33:51.527
We never saw her again.
I didn't know her last name.

734
00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.225
<i>That didn't stop you from</i>
<i>making stupid jokes about her</i>

735
00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:56.259
<i>every day on the show!</i>

736
00:33:56.392 --> 00:33:58.259
<i>About her face. her voice.</i>

737
00:33:58.392 --> 00:33:59.693
<i>She didn't dare speak up</i>

738
00:33:59.827 --> 00:34:02.527
<i>because Mr. Big Wig</i>
<i>is the star of radio.</i>

739
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.627
<i>She thought that.</i>
<i>by leaving after five months.</i>

740
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.093
<i>she'd be able to forget.</i>
<i>but no!</i>

741
00:34:07.225 --> 00:34:09.727
<i>Because people never stopped</i>
<i>talking about it to her.</i>

742
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.527
<i>I've been with her</i>
<i>since high school.</i>

743
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:13.259
<i>And yes.</i>
<i>she had other problems.</i>

744
00:34:13.392 --> 00:34:16.560
<i>but you. you were</i>
<i>the fucking cherry on top!</i>

745
00:34:16.693 --> 00:34:20.325
<i>It was always like</i>
<i>a pressure cooker. and boom!</i>

746
00:34:20.894 --> 00:34:23.093
Boom what? It's shock radio.

747
00:34:23.225 --> 00:34:25.627
We fuck around.
That's what we do.
We make jokes. okay?

748
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.593
<i>It's not for you to decide</i>
<i>what's funny and what's not!</i>

749
00:34:29.727 --> 00:34:32.927
<i>See. being at</i>
<i>your fuckin' house with Olivia</i>
<i>and your daughter.</i>

750
00:34:33.059 --> 00:34:34.727
<i>now that's funny. oh. yeah.</i>

751
00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.126
Yeah. okay. all right.

752
00:34:36.259 --> 00:34:38.793
Look. I'll do anything
to help Lily-- Lauren.

753
00:34:38.927 --> 00:34:40.193
I'll make it up to her.

754
00:34:40.325 --> 00:34:42.425
<i>There is something you can do.</i>

755
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.159
<i>You can take your wireless mic</i>

756
00:34:44.292 --> 00:34:46.259
<i>and go up</i>
<i>to the studio's terrace</i>

757
00:34:46.392 --> 00:34:48.560
<i>with someone</i>
<i>from your shitty team.</i>

758
00:34:49.193 --> 00:34:50.560
I... I don't get it.

759
00:34:50.693 --> 00:34:52.660
<i>You'll get it</i>
<i>when you're up there.</i>

760
00:34:52.793 --> 00:34:55.059
<i>Now. move your ass!</i>
Okay. okay. calm down.

761
00:34:55.193 --> 00:34:57.325
Mary. get a mic
and a headphone ready.

762
00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.026
Okay?

763
00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.326
We're coming with you.

764
00:35:06.461 --> 00:35:07.694
Okay.

765
00:35:10.226 --> 00:35:11.461
Let's go.

766
00:35:23.728 --> 00:35:24.794
Okay. I'm here.

767
00:35:24.928 --> 00:35:27.494
<i>Cool. Breathe.</i>

768
00:35:27.628 --> 00:35:29.127
Okay. just tell me
what you want

769
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.661
so we can get this
over with. huh?

770
00:35:30.794 --> 00:35:33.194
<i>You see that ashtray</i>
<i>by the wall?</i>

771
00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.628
How do you know there's
an ashtray by the wall. Gary?

772
00:35:37.761 --> 00:35:41.528
<i>That's where Lauren came to cry</i>
<i>after you humiliated her.</i>

773
00:35:43.194 --> 00:35:44.194
She tell you that?

774
00:35:44.326 --> 00:35:45.928
<i>No. I was there.</i>

775
00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.326
Okay.

776
00:35:47.461 --> 00:35:50.528
<i>I was having a smoke</i>
<i>when she showed up in tears.</i>

777
00:35:51.293 --> 00:35:52.728
How'd you even
get in the building?

778
00:35:52.861 --> 00:35:55.594
<i>I worked there for my job.</i>

779
00:35:55.728 --> 00:35:59.528
<i>Oh. Elvis.</i>
<i>we met so many times.</i>
<i>and you never said hello.</i>

780
00:35:59.661 --> 00:36:01.928
<i>But hey. you treat</i>
<i>your own colleagues like dirt.</i>

781
00:36:02.094 --> 00:36:05.060
<i>It's no surprise you never</i>
<i>gave me the time of day.</i>

782
00:36:05.528 --> 00:36:06.360
Who are you?

783
00:36:06.494 --> 00:36:08.326
<i>Does it really matter?</i>

784
00:36:10.794 --> 00:36:14.027
Are you Gary Harlowe?

785
00:36:14.761 --> 00:36:16.127
<i>Not anymore.</i>

786
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.628
What does that mean?

787
00:36:17.761 --> 00:36:19.661
<i>It means tonight</i>
<i>I don't give a fuck.</i>

788
00:36:20.794 --> 00:36:22.961
<i>I'm not that friendly</i>
<i>security guard anymore</i>

789
00:36:23.094 --> 00:36:24.995
<i>who always greeted you</i>
<i>with a smile.</i>

790
00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:29.160
Man. look. I am really sorry.
I just don't remember. okay?

791
00:36:29.293 --> 00:36:32.427
<i>Anyway. what I want you</i>
<i>to do now</i>

792
00:36:32.561 --> 00:36:35.361
<i>is to climb up onto that wall.</i>

793
00:36:35.494 --> 00:36:37.494
<i>I set up a little staircase</i>
<i>for you.</i>

794
00:36:39.427 --> 00:36:40.528
You can't be serious.

795
00:36:40.661 --> 00:36:42.361
<i>Does it sound like I'm joking?</i>

796
00:36:42.494 --> 00:36:45.694
<i>Hey. Adria. does it look</i>
<i>like I'm fooling around?</i>

797
00:36:45.828 --> 00:36:48.094
<i>Do I make you laugh. kid?</i>

798
00:36:48.226 --> 00:36:49.427
<i>Elvis!</i>

799
00:36:49.561 --> 00:36:51.794
<i>Relax. Everything's fine.</i>

800
00:36:51.928 --> 00:36:55.661
<i>Elvis is gonna get up</i>
<i>onto that fucking wall.</i>

801
00:37:15.461 --> 00:37:16.494
Fuck!

802
00:37:24.761 --> 00:37:27.628
I'm on the wall.
You happy? What now?

803
00:37:27.761 --> 00:37:29.260
<i>Thank you.</i>

804
00:37:29.995 --> 00:37:31.226
Gary. I don't like heights.

805
00:37:31.361 --> 00:37:33.094
You can tell Lauren
I'm shit scared

806
00:37:33.226 --> 00:37:35.160
if you think it makes you
feel any better. okay?

807
00:37:35.294 --> 00:37:37.094
<i>Well. that won't be easy.</i>

808
00:37:38.361 --> 00:37:40.060
<i>because she's dead.</i>

809
00:37:41.494 --> 00:37:43.661
<i>She committed suicide</i>
<i>a month ago.</i>

810
00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:46.260
<i>You should see</i>
<i>what she writes about you</i>
<i>in her letter.</i>

811
00:37:46.394 --> 00:37:48.294
<i>It's not very nice.</i>

812
00:37:48.427 --> 00:37:50.895
<i>She jumped</i>
<i>from her apartment balcony.</i>

813
00:37:51.027 --> 00:37:52.494
<i>Five stories.</i>

814
00:37:53.628 --> 00:37:56.394
Gary. I'm sorry.
Man. I'm really sorry.

815
00:37:56.528 --> 00:37:57.861
I've learned my lesson.

816
00:37:57.995 --> 00:38:00.661
Can we please stop
this nonsense?

817
00:38:00.794 --> 00:38:02.694
<i>When I came back</i>
<i>from Afghanistan.</i>

818
00:38:02.828 --> 00:38:04.294
<i>I tried to kill myself too.</i>

819
00:38:04.427 --> 00:38:07.060
<i>A pussy like you</i>
<i>wouldn't last a day over there.</i>

820
00:38:07.194 --> 00:38:09.561
<i>They said I was</i>
<i>psychologically damaged.</i>

821
00:38:09.694 --> 00:38:11.528
<i>Bullshit.</i>
Gary. life is beautiful.

822
00:38:11.661 --> 00:38:13.761
<i>No. it's not!</i>

823
00:38:13.895 --> 00:38:16.261
<i>Now. I want you to jump.</i>

824
00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.294
Come on. Gary.
nobody would do that.
I'm not gonna jump.

825
00:38:27.427 --> 00:38:29.194
<i>If you don't jump.</i>
<i>I'll kill them.</i>

826
00:38:29.327 --> 00:38:30.895
<i>You know I will!</i>

827
00:38:31.027 --> 00:38:32.761
<i>It's you or them!</i>

828
00:38:32.895 --> 00:38:35.194
Oh. for fuck sake. Gary.
can't we sort this out?

829
00:38:35.327 --> 00:38:36.694
Come on.
I'm begging you. please.

830
00:38:36.828 --> 00:38:38.361
<i>Jump!</i>

831
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.594
I can't.

832
00:38:45.861 --> 00:38:47.494
<i>I knew it.</i>

833
00:38:47.628 --> 00:38:48.995
<i>I knew it.</i>

834
00:38:49.127 --> 00:38:51.227
<i>I knew you'd shit your pants.</i>

835
00:38:51.361 --> 00:38:53.528
<i>Not even a shred of dignity.</i>

836
00:38:53.661 --> 00:38:56.327
<i>That's why I didn't want you</i>
<i>to go alone.</i>

837
00:38:56.794 --> 00:39:00.094
<i>Dylan. push him.</i>

838
00:39:00.661 --> 00:39:01.628
No.

839
00:39:01.761 --> 00:39:03.694
<i>Push him.</i>
<i>or a five-year-old dies.</i>

840
00:39:03.828 --> 00:39:05.427
Gary. you sick fuck!

841
00:39:05.561 --> 00:39:08.694
I hope you die
and burn forever!

842
00:39:08.828 --> 00:39:10.361
<i>Last chance. Dylan.</i>

843
00:39:11.661 --> 00:39:13.228
<i>Push him!</i>
No.

844
00:39:13.362 --> 00:39:14.929
It's okay. it's okay.

845
00:39:15.061 --> 00:39:17.295
Gary. I'll jump.

846
00:39:18.161 --> 00:39:19.196
Put my wife on.

847
00:39:19.328 --> 00:39:21.095
What are you doing?

848
00:39:23.428 --> 00:39:25.462
I'm so sorry. my dear.

849
00:39:26.629 --> 00:39:28.028
I love you.

850
00:39:28.929 --> 00:39:30.161
Take care of Adria.

851
00:39:30.295 --> 00:39:32.495
Okay?

852
00:39:32.629 --> 00:39:33.695
I have no choice.

853
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:35.562
<i>No. no. no.</i>
<i>no. no. no. no!</i>

854
00:39:35.695 --> 00:39:37.929
<i>Please. I'm begging you.</i>
<i>I'm begging you. please.</i>

855
00:39:38.061 --> 00:39:39.295
<i>Please!</i>

856
00:39:44.328 --> 00:39:45.629
Don't. Elvis. no!

857
00:40:02.595 --> 00:40:06.196
<i>Tell me. Dylan.</i>
<i>did that asshole jump?</i>

858
00:40:06.595 --> 00:40:07.562
Yes.

859
00:40:09.495 --> 00:40:12.629
<i>Thank you. Dylan.</i>

860
00:40:12.762 --> 00:40:16.129
<i>Hey. listen. I'm sorry</i>
<i>I put you in that situation.</i>

861
00:40:16.262 --> 00:40:18.395
<i>I did you a favor. though.</i>
<i>That guy would</i>
<i>have tortured you.</i>

862
00:40:18.529 --> 00:40:19.795
<i>just like he did to Lauren.</i>

863
00:40:19.929 --> 00:40:21.896
<i>He was a real</i>
<i>son of a bitch. you know.</i>

864
00:40:22.028 --> 00:40:23.362
You can free his wife
and daughter

865
00:40:23.495 --> 00:40:25.996
because he jumped.
he's dead.

866
00:40:26.129 --> 00:40:27.328
Just let them go.

867
00:40:27.462 --> 00:40:30.495
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>I'm a man of my word.</i>

868
00:40:31.962 --> 00:40:33.462
<i>I just...</i>

869
00:40:33.595 --> 00:40:36.529
<i>I just need proof</i>
<i>that he really jumped.</i>

870
00:40:37.529 --> 00:40:39.095
<i>I mean. you wouldn't</i>
<i>lie to me. right?</i>

871
00:40:39.228 --> 00:40:41.729
I'm telling you. he jumped.
Just let them go.

872
00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:07.495
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

873
00:41:07.629 --> 00:41:10.829
<i>You filthy liars!</i>
<i>You're all motherfuckers!</i>

874
00:41:11.862 --> 00:41:13.695
<i>Dylan. you've really</i>
<i>disappointed me.</i>

875
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:16.762
No. wait. don't get angry.
I can explain. okay?

876
00:41:16.896 --> 00:41:20.695
<i>I wanted to film Elvis's jump</i>
<i>and post it online.</i>

877
00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:22.829
<i>You've really</i>
<i>made a fool out of me.</i>

878
00:41:22.962 --> 00:41:24.462
Hey. hey. Gary.
this is my fault.

879
00:41:24.595 --> 00:41:26.395
I apologize. okay?
<i>It's too late!</i>

880
00:41:26.529 --> 00:41:28.729
I'm sorry.
<i>An eye for an eye. Elvis.</i>

881
00:41:28.862 --> 00:41:33.495
Gary...
<i>Now you can see what it's like</i>
<i>to lose someone you love.</i>

882
00:41:33.629 --> 00:41:35.862
The police is ready to go.
They're headed in!

883
00:41:35.996 --> 00:41:37.428
Gary. the cops
are coming in right now.

884
00:41:37.562 --> 00:41:40.428
I'm begging you. please!
Give it up! Stop it!

885
00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:46.096
Wait.

886
00:42:47.196 --> 00:42:49.395
The police want
to get you on the phone.

887
00:42:53.062 --> 00:42:54.462
Yeah?

888
00:42:57.963 --> 00:42:59.362
What?

889
00:43:00.929 --> 00:43:02.428
Uh...

890
00:43:07.929 --> 00:43:09.662
That can't be.

891
00:43:16.295 --> 00:43:18.428
Go with him.
I'll lock up the studio.

892
00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:48.897
It's impossible.

893
00:43:49.063 --> 00:43:50.730
What's going on?

894
00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:54.030
The cops say...

895
00:43:55.496 --> 00:43:57.663
- there's no one home.
- What?

896
00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:01.163
They checked every room.

897
00:44:01.296 --> 00:44:02.763
No signs of forced entry.

898
00:44:02.898 --> 00:44:04.596
The dogs are alive.

899
00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:06.197
I don't get it.

900
00:44:06.329 --> 00:44:08.796
And your daughter.
your... your wife?

901
00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:10.030
Not there.

902
00:44:10.163 --> 00:44:11.931
I don't know.

903
00:44:12.063 --> 00:44:14.097
They looked everywhere.
Nothing.

<i>did not want to</i>
<i>get into my car.</i>

927
00:46:17.429 --> 00:46:18.730
<i>It was a struggle.</i>

928
00:46:18.864 --> 00:46:20.864
<i>Kind of like rassling</i>
<i>a couple of piglets.</i>

929
00:46:23.463 --> 00:46:25.197

Elvis has left the building...

957
00:47:37.664 --> 00:47:40.698
<i>No one called you.</i>
<i>Miss America.</i>
<i>I'm playing with Elvis.</i>

958
00:47:40.832 --> 00:47:43.198
<i>I don't talk to women</i>
<i>who sleep with married men.</i>

959
00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:45.832
<i>Either Elvis</i>

<i>Ah! Okay. Elvis.</i>

980
00:48:44.765 --> 00:48:46.131
<i>And he's back!</i>

981
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:51.230
<i>Were you taking a dump?</i>

982
00:48:51.999 --> 00:48:54.430
<i>So. where are you. my friend?</i>

983
00:48:54.564 --> 00:48:55.597
In reception.

984
00:48:55.732 --> 00:48:56.665
<i>Oh. in reception.</i>

985
00:48:56.798 --> 00:48:58.198
<i>Ha!</i>

986
00:48:59.665 --> 00:49:02.531
<i>Sorry I didn't have time</i>
<i>to clean up the entrance.</i>

987
00:49:02.665 --> 00:49:04.264
Yeah. did you
have to kill him?

988
00:49:04.397 --> 00:49:06.932
<i>Yes. I did.</i>
<i>That guard was very impolite.</i>

989
00:49:07.064 --> 00:49:08.397
<i>Not friendly at all.</i>

990
00:49:08.531 --> 00:49:10.765
<i>I told him I used to work</i>
<i>the same job.</i>

991
00:49:10.899 --> 00:49:12.732
<i>He didn't want to open</i>
<i>the door at first.</i>

992
00:49:12.865 --> 00:49:15.497
<i>but thank God</i>
<i>he recognized your wife.</i>
<i>so he let us in.</i>

993
00:49:15.632 --> 00:49:17.131
<i>Didn't seem to like</i>
<i>my face. though.</i>

994
00:49:17.264 --> 00:49:18.765
<i>He didn't want</i>
<i>to give me a badge.</i>

995
00:49:18.899 --> 00:49:20.531
<i>What a jerk.</i>

996
00:49:21.297 --> 00:49:22.965
So now it's your turn.
Where are you?

997
00:49:23.098 --> 00:49:24.665
<i>I'll let you in on a secret.</i>

998
00:49:24.798 --> 00:49:27.098
<i>I'm still at your home.</i>
<i>in a way.</i>

999
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:29.164
<i>I wasn't exactly</i>
<i>lying to you earlier.</i>

1000
00:49:29.297 --> 00:49:30.497
<i>I'm at your home.</i>

1001
00:49:30.632 --> 00:49:33.798
<i>This is your second home.</i>
<i>after all.</i>

1002
00:49:33.932 --> 00:49:36.798

<i>boom!</i>

1007
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:55.698
You're gonna blow up the door.
Why?

1008
00:49:55.832 --> 00:49:57.865
<i>The door?</i>

1009
00:49:57.999 --> 00:50:00.665
<i>No. I respect your show. Elvis.</i>

1010
00:50:00.798 --> 00:50:03.330
<i>It deserves some sparkle.</i>

1011
00:50:03.464 --> 00:50:05.732
<i>You should check</i>
<i>your social media.</i>

1012
00:50:06.297 --> 00:50:08.031
<i>Man. I'm excited.</i>

1013
00:50:08.164 --> 00:50:11.131
<i>In the army.</i>
<i>I was an explosive ordnance</i>
<i>disposal specialist.</i>

1014
00:50:11.264 --> 00:50:14.031
<i>I miss fireworks.</i>

1015
00:50:18.164 --> 00:50:19.497
He's gonna blow everything up.

1016
00:50:19.632 --> 00:50:22.364
Windows. the door.
the basement. the garage.

1017
00:50:22.497 --> 00:50:24.297
Everything is wired to blow.

1018
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:27.532
<i>If only Lauren could see this.</i>

1019
00:50:27.665 --> 00:50:29.464
<i>On the other hand.</i>
<i>she'd probably tell me</i>

1020
00:50:29.598 --> 00:50:31.230
<i>just to blow it all up</i>
<i>right away.</i>

1021
00:50:31.364 --> 00:50:32.832
<i>She didn't like to play games.</i>

1022
00:50:32.965 --> 00:50:34.397
<i>but you never understood that.</i>

1023
00:50:34.532 --> 00:50:36.297
Seems like
a lot of work. Gary.

1024
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:38.297
How'd you set all that up?

1025
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:41.198
<i>I could have</i>
<i>done it better. trust me.</i>
<i>I didn't have much time.</i>

1026
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:42.632
<i>Should do the trick anyway.</i>

1027
00:50:42.765 --> 00:50:44.164
<i>With a bit of luck.</i>
<i>the explosions</i>

1028
00:50:44.297 --> 00:50:46.865
<i>will bring down</i>
<i>this whole building.</i>

1029
00:50:47.297 --> 00:50:49.031
Elvis.

1030
00:50:50.364 --> 00:50:51.798
I don't wanna die here.

1031
00:50:51.932 --> 00:50:55.264
Well. if we don't wanna die.
we gotta fight.

1032
00:50:56.098 --> 00:50:57.832
He's in the building.
We can get him.

1033
00:50:57.965 --> 00:50:59.532
You hear that. Gary?

1034
00:50:59.665 --> 00:51:01.632
<i>He's right. Dylan. really.</i>

1035
00:51:01.765 --> 00:51:05.164
<i>I said it was a game.</i>
<i>and I'm gonna follow the rules.</i>

1036
00:51:05.297 --> 00:51:06.965
<i>Military code of honor.</i>

1037
00:51:07.098 --> 00:51:08.397
<i>You have a chance.</i>

1038
00:51:08.532 --> 00:51:10.999
<i>If you find me.</i>
<i>I won't blow up the building.</i>

1039
00:51:11.131 --> 00:51:12.397
<i>I'll let you go.</i>

1040
00:51:12.532 --> 00:51:15.230
<i>and I'll just kill Elvis.</i>

1041
00:51:15.364 --> 00:51:19.465
Well. then show yourself.
you slippery son of a bitch!

1042
00:51:20.732 --> 00:51:22.164
Let my girls go. okay?

1043
00:51:22.297 --> 00:51:25.131
You don't need 'em.
They're just a liability
for you.

1044
00:51:25.264 --> 00:51:26.430
It's just you and me.
Man up.

1045
00:51:26.565 --> 00:51:28.765
If you're a real man.
come down here.

1046
00:51:28.899 --> 00:51:30.230
duke it out with me. okay?

1047
00:51:30.364 --> 00:51:31.865
We'll settle this!

1048
00:51:31.999 --> 00:51:35.199
I'm too old to play fuckin'
hide-and-seek. all right?

1049
00:51:36.265 --> 00:51:37.633
<i>Are you done?</i>

1050
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.566
<i>I don't think you get it.</i>

1051
00:51:40.699 --> 00:51:43.666
<i>Instead of wasting your time</i>
<i>talking shit.</i>

1052
00:51:43.799 --> 00:51:47.499
<i>why don't you try to find me</i>
<i>and save your family?</i>

1053
00:51:48.699 --> 00:51:52.633
All right. we'll do it
the fuckin' hard way.

1054
00:52:26.466 --> 00:52:28.365
<i>This could have made</i>
<i>a great movie.</i>

1055
00:52:28.499 --> 00:52:31.199
<i>"The bad guy's hiding</i>
<i>somewhere in the building.</i>

1056
00:52:31.331 --> 00:52:33.099
<i>the good guy</i>
<i>is looking for him.</i>

1057
00:52:33.231 --> 00:52:34.733
<i>And then they all blow up!</i>

1058
00:52:34.866 --> 00:52:35.966
<i>The end."</i>

1059
00:52:36.099 --> 00:52:37.766
<i>What do you think?</i>

1060
00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:39.733
I think you need a rewrite.

1061
00:52:40.399 --> 00:52:42.533
Sounds like a real stinker.

1062
00:53:27.331 --> 00:53:29.165
What's the fuck's going on?

1063
00:53:29.298 --> 00:53:31.566
Come on. Ton...

1064
00:53:32.533 --> 00:53:34.366
Tony? What the hell is this?

1065
00:53:34.499 --> 00:53:36.065
What. you know him?

1066
00:53:36.199 --> 00:53:38.332
Yes. It's Tony.
He's been working here
for 20 years.

1067
00:53:38.466 --> 00:53:40.633
I didn't know it was you.
Mr. Elvis. I'm sorry.

1068
00:53:40.766 --> 00:53:44.231
What the hell got into you.
attacking him like that?
I don't know him!

1069
00:53:44.366 --> 00:53:46.466
You know.
I couldn't see shit.

1070
00:53:46.599 --> 00:53:48.833
I just saw the dead guard
at the entrance.

1071
00:53:49.432 --> 00:53:50.833
So I hid in the dark.

1072
00:53:50.966 --> 00:53:53.666
And when you guys came in.
I just jumped on the first guy.

1073
00:53:53.799 --> 00:53:57.265
What if he works for Gary
and he's lying because
he couldn't take me out?

1074
00:53:57.399 --> 00:53:59.265
Out of the question.
I've known this guy
since forever.

1075
00:53:59.399 --> 00:54:00.666
When you guys came in.

1076
00:54:00.799 --> 00:54:03.399
I just assumed
you were part of his team.

1077
00:54:03.533 --> 00:54:04.332
Whose team?

1078
00:54:04.466 --> 00:54:05.966
The fucking crazy guy's team.

1079
00:54:06.099 --> 00:54:08.733
The guy that came around
with the woman
and the little girl?

1080
00:54:10.299 --> 00:54:12.366
Elvis. I couldn't see anything.

1081
00:54:12.499 --> 00:54:14.000
It was super dark.
It was fuzzy.

1082
00:54:14.132 --> 00:54:16.099
Yeah. but I do remember
he was wearing a hat.

1083
00:54:16.231 --> 00:54:17.666
That I do.

1084
00:54:18.733 --> 00:54:21.666
And his eyes.
I could never forget his eyes.

1085
00:54:21.799 --> 00:54:26.265
I mean. he... this guy looks
as if he just escaped
a fucking mental asylum.

1086
00:54:26.399 --> 00:54:29.000
I mean. he's totally cuckoo.

1087
00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:30.866
Why the hell didn't you
get out of here?

1088
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.499
I did. I tried...

1089
00:54:32.633 --> 00:54:36.733
I-I... I tried to leave
through the parking lot area.

1090
00:54:36.866 --> 00:54:39.799
just to find that it was
full with explosives.

1091
00:54:39.933 --> 00:54:42.466
A whole door--
I mean. the whole building
for that matter.

1092
00:54:42.599 --> 00:54:46.666
it's filled with explosives.
I mean. just. you know...

1093
00:54:48.299 --> 00:54:50.132
What's going on. Elvis?
I mean. come on.

1094
00:54:50.266 --> 00:54:51.366
Are we all going to die?

1095
00:54:51.499 --> 00:54:53.432
<i>I am loving this.</i>

1096
00:54:53.566 --> 00:54:56.000
<i>What a shit show!</i>
<i>You okay. Elvis?</i>

1097
00:54:56.165 --> 00:54:57.533
<i>Little Dylan</i>
<i>still in one piece?</i>

1098
00:54:57.666 --> 00:54:59.866
<i>I hadn't planned</i>
<i>on Tony showing up.</i>

1099
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.165
<i>Tony. my man! I remember you.</i>

1100
00:55:02.299 --> 00:55:03.432
<i>What a nice guy.</i>

1101
00:55:03.566 --> 00:55:05.065
Well. apparently
I'm getting warmer.

1102
00:55:05.199 --> 00:55:07.165
You went by here
recently too. huh?

1103
00:55:07.299 --> 00:55:08.933
<i>Hold on a second. though.</i>

1104
00:55:09.065 --> 00:55:12.466
<i>It's no fair</i>
<i>if Tony's joining your team</i>
<i>all of a sudden.</i>

1105
00:55:12.599 --> 00:55:14.799
Is he talking into
your headphones right now?

1106
00:55:15.432 --> 00:55:16.699
What's he saying?

1107
00:55:16.833 --> 00:55:18.566
<i>There's no room</i>
<i>for an extra player.</i>

1108
00:55:18.699 --> 00:55:20.132
<i>Kill him.</i>

1109
00:55:22.032 --> 00:55:23.733
<i>Kill that son of a bitch.</i>

1110
00:55:23.866 --> 00:55:25.666
I'm not killing anybody.

1111
00:55:25.799 --> 00:55:28.266
Tony will sit in a corner
and he won't say
another fucking word. okay?

1112
00:55:28.399 --> 00:55:29.633
He's not coming with us.

1113
00:55:29.766 --> 00:55:32.132
<i>No. Tony wasn't</i>
<i>part of my plan.</i>

1114
00:55:32.266 --> 00:55:33.766
<i>He was supposed to clock out</i>
<i>at 10:00 p.m.</i>

1115
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.599
<i>What the hell's he still</i>
<i>doing here anyway?</i>

1116
00:55:35.733 --> 00:55:38.165
You get out of here. walk away.
just get out of here.

1117
00:55:38.299 --> 00:55:41.267
<i>No. that's not okay.</i>
<i>This is pissing me off. Elvis.</i>

1118
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.834
<i>Ask him what he's doing here.</i>

1119
00:55:42.967 --> 00:55:45.133
Okay. he wants to know
what you're doing here.

1120
00:55:45.267 --> 00:55:47.400
why you didn't leave
at 10:00 p.m.

1121
00:55:49.567 --> 00:55:50.634
Me?

1122
00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.133
You were supposed to leave
at 10:00 p.m.. right?
Yeah.

1123
00:55:54.267 --> 00:55:55.834
What the hell
are you still doing here?

1124
00:55:55.967 --> 00:55:58.267
<i>This is fishy.</i>
Uh...

1125
00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.100
<i>If he doesn't answer.</i>
<i>kill that son of a bitch.</i>

1126
00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.166
I'll tell you.

1127
00:56:05.367 --> 00:56:07.333
You know.
I finished my shift.

1128
00:56:07.467 --> 00:56:09.201
There were some areas
that I had to finish.

1129
00:56:09.333 --> 00:56:11.534
that I...
had to take care of.

1130
00:56:11.667 --> 00:56:14.767
and-and I wanted to take a walk
around the office before I did.

1131
00:56:14.901 --> 00:56:16.667
That's... That's it.

1132
00:56:17.167 --> 00:56:18.233
You're lying.

1133
00:56:18.367 --> 00:56:19.834
What's your problem?

1134
00:56:19.967 --> 00:56:22.133
No. you tell me
what you're doing here.
Tell me now.

1135
00:56:22.267 --> 00:56:24.267
Elvis--
What the fuck is up?
Tell me now!

1136
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:27.433
<i>Ah. now we got some action.</i>
<i>Elvis is getting angry.</i>

1137
00:56:27.567 --> 00:56:31.201
No. wait. He's the guy
stealing the computers.

1138
00:56:31.333 --> 00:56:33.167
the one you were
talking about on air.

1139
00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:36.300
Tony?
You been stealing from us?

1140
00:56:41.066 --> 00:56:42.800
I'm really sorry. Elvis.

1141
00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.600
I really am.

1142
00:56:45.734 --> 00:56:49.500
You see.
my wife is very sick
over in Spain. and...

1143
00:56:49.634 --> 00:56:52.667
I need it desperately.
I needed the cash.

1144
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.567
I'm not doing anything wrong.
It's my cousin that sells them.

1145
00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:58.667
I just give it to him.
He gives me a little cut
every time.

1146
00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:01.567
But it's only the sales team's
computer that I take.

1147
00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:05.167
I mean. I never ever
even dream of touching
one of yours. I swear.

1148
00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:07.066
You gotta believe me.

1149
00:57:07.201 --> 00:57:10.134
<i>We're not gonna let him</i>
<i>get away with this. Elvis.</i>
<i>are we?</i>

1150
00:57:12.066 --> 00:57:13.800
<i>Ticktock.</i>

1151
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:15.700
<i>Ticktock!</i>

1152
00:57:15.834 --> 00:57:17.734
<i>Ticktock. time is running out.</i>

1153
00:57:17.867 --> 00:57:19.767
<i>Kill this fucking thief</i>
<i>and come find me.</i>

1154
00:57:19.901 --> 00:57:22.901
Tony. go upstairs
and hide in the studio.
okay?

1155
00:57:23.033 --> 00:57:24.500
W-We'll settle this later.
okay?

1156
00:57:24.634 --> 00:57:26.700
Go on. pal. get outta here.
Thank you. Elvis.

1157
00:57:26.834 --> 00:57:27.667
I owe you.

1158
00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.066
<i>Elvis! What a mensch!</i>

1159
00:57:30.201 --> 00:57:31.500
<i>A true hero.</i>

1160
00:57:31.634 --> 00:57:33.233
<i>If it were me.</i>
<i>I'd have taken him out.</i>

1161
00:57:33.367 --> 00:57:35.333
<i>but you. you are a class act.</i>

1162
00:57:35.467 --> 00:57:39.467
<i>What Hollywood actor</i>
<i>do you think would play you</i>
<i>in the movie of our game. huh?</i>

1163
00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.400
<i>Tom Cruise?</i>

1164
00:57:40.534 --> 00:57:42.734
<i>I'd cast Joaquin Phoenix as me.</i>

1165
00:57:42.867 --> 00:57:44.767
<i>Tonight. I'm kind of a joker.</i>

1166
00:57:50.167 --> 00:57:53.267
"I have a condition!"

1167
00:58:22.267 --> 00:58:24.700
<i>I like silence.</i>

1168
00:58:29.134 --> 00:58:31.233
<i>Cold!</i>

1169
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.034
<i>Hot.</i>

1170
00:58:43.267 --> 00:58:45.700
<i>I wouldn't go in there</i>
<i>if I were you.</i>

1171
00:58:46.901 --> 00:58:49.567
<i>Getting warmer.</i>

1172
00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.101
<i>Not in there.</i>

1173
00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.734
<i>Okay. okay. okay.</i>

1174
00:59:01.867 --> 00:59:04.034
<i>This isn't supposed</i>
<i>to take all night.</i>

1175
00:59:04.167 --> 00:59:08.267
<i>And since I'm a nice guy.</i>
<i>here's some help</i>
<i>from someone special.</i>

1176
00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.767
<i>Go on. sweetie.</i>

1177
00:59:09.901 --> 00:59:11.667
<i>Give Daddy a clue.</i>

1178
00:59:12.734 --> 00:59:16.333
<i>Daddy. I'm in a closet</i>
<i>with some toys.</i>

1179
00:59:16.467 --> 00:59:19.134
<i>Oh. now. that's too easy.</i>

1180
00:59:35.367 --> 00:59:37.500
Hyah!

1181
01:00:15.701 --> 01:00:17.202
It's Adria's.

1182
01:00:18.801 --> 01:00:20.936
He's doing this
to drive you crazy.

1183
01:00:21.068 --> 01:00:23.368
<i>Now. isn't that cute?</i>

1184
01:00:23.501 --> 01:00:25.368
<i>Dear listeners.</i>
<i>let me set the scene.</i>

1185
01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:28.768
<i>Shock jock Elvis clutching</i>
<i>a plush toy covered in blood.</i>

1186
01:00:28.902 --> 01:00:32.135
<i>and newbie Dylan who looks</i>
<i>like he's about to lose it.</i>

1187
01:00:32.268 --> 01:00:33.635
<i>And see.</i>
<i>from where I'm sitting.</i>

1188
01:00:33.768 --> 01:00:36.768
<i>I'm lucky enough</i>
<i>to watch the whole scene.</i>

1189
01:00:48.301 --> 01:00:50.468
He's been watching us
from the start.

1190
01:00:50.601 --> 01:00:52.368
I know where the son
of a bitch is hiding.

1191
01:00:52.501 --> 01:00:54.568
He can only be
in the camera room
in the basement.

1192
01:00:54.701 --> 01:00:56.368
Okay. so let's call
the police to save time.

1193
01:00:56.501 --> 01:00:58.135
We don't have the luxury
of time.

1194
01:00:58.268 --> 01:00:59.568
He's a madman.

1195
01:00:59.701 --> 01:01:01.668
I've dealt with kooks
like this for 30 years.

1196
01:01:01.801 --> 01:01:03.468
He's the type
to go through with it.

1197
01:01:03.601 --> 01:01:07.568
He'll kill my girls
unless we stop him. Okay?

1198
01:01:07.701 --> 01:01:11.368
By the time the cops get here.
fuck. it's hopeless.

1199
01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.701
He just wants
to knock everyone off
and then do himself.

1200
01:01:13.835 --> 01:01:16.903
We don't stand a chance.
This won't end well.
No.

1201
01:01:17.035 --> 01:01:19.768
<i>Elvis. no secret powwows.</i>

1202
01:01:19.903 --> 01:01:21.301
<i>Turn your mic back on.</i>

1203
01:01:21.434 --> 01:01:23.268
Listen. you don't have
to come with me.

1204
01:01:23.401 --> 01:01:25.135
but I think it's safer
if we stick together.

1205
01:01:25.268 --> 01:01:27.401
I know a way
where there's no cameras.

1206
01:01:27.535 --> 01:01:29.701
We can sneak up on him
in the basement.

1207
01:01:31.401 --> 01:01:33.768
<i>Elvis.</i>
<i>think about your listeners.</i>

1208
01:01:33.903 --> 01:01:35.969
<i>We are live on the air!</i>

1209
01:01:36.102 --> 01:01:37.735
<i>Turn your microphone back on.</i>

1210
01:01:37.869 --> 01:01:39.202
Okay. I'll play.

1211
01:01:40.468 --> 01:01:42.869
I'll bet you're somewhere
in the upper floors. am I right?

1212
01:01:43.003 --> 01:01:45.234
<i>Maybe.</i>

1213
01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.334
Yeah. I'm comin'. numb nuts.

1214
01:02:23.268 --> 01:02:25.334
Stop! Wait!

1215
01:02:27.802 --> 01:02:29.368
Hang on.

1216
01:02:30.936 --> 01:02:33.401
We have to hurry.
There's no camera down here.

1217
01:02:33.535 --> 01:02:35.268
He'll be looking for us
on the other side

1218
01:02:35.401 --> 01:02:37.068
and realize we're not there.
Come on.

1219
01:02:37.202 --> 01:02:41.003
<i>Hey. guys.</i>
<i>you're supposed to find</i> me.
<i>remember.</i>

1220

1221
01:02:43.535 --> 01:02:46.234
<i>But. hey. I'm not against</i>
<i>spicing things up.</i>

1222
01:02:46.368 --> 01:02:48.301
<i>Come on. give me a clue.</i>

1224
01:02:53.701 --> 01:02:58.735
Hey. Gary. I'm coming
upstairs to find ya.
you sick puke.

1225
01:03:06.202 --> 01:03:07.869
There's the security cameras
in that room.

1226
01:03:08.003 --> 01:03:09.268
He's in there.

1227
01:03:09.903 --> 01:03:12.735
<i>Where are you hiding?</i>

1228
01:03:34.234 --> 01:03:36.368
One. two...

Go!

1230
01:03:37.635 --> 01:03:40.501
All right.
Turn around or I'll brain ya.

1231

01:03:57.203 --> 01:04:01.169
<i>Did you really think</i>
<i>I'd be in there when I can</i>
<i>hack into any camera?</i>

1233
01:04:01.302 --> 01:04:02.703
<i>I have a knack for computers.</i>

1234
01:04:02.837 --> 01:04:05.569
<i>And frankly. breaking into</i>
<i>a 25-year-old security system</i>

1235
01:04:05.703 --> 01:04:08.469
<i>was easier than stealing</i>
<i>my sister's Netflix password.</i>

1236
01:04:08.602 --> 01:04:11.636
<i>I've got all the cameras</i>
<i>right here on a tablet.</i>

1241
01:04:29.402 --> 01:04:31.636
<i>What an ingrate.</i>
<i>You could at least thank me.</i>

1242
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:35.402
Thank you for what?
<i>Well. you never liked</i>
<i>that asshole Justin. did you?</i>

1243
01:04:35.536 --> 01:04:38.369
<i>This will make it easier for</i>

<i>No more sleepless nights</i>

<i>Nothing's ever good enough</i>

1247
01:04:45.569 --> 01:04:47.136
Why don't you tell me

1248
01:04:47.269 --> 01:04:49.770
so I can come
and thank you personally?

1249

<i>Nah. you can thank me later.</i>

1250

Son of a bitch.

1251
01:04:54.737 --> 01:04:56.870
<i>You're right. Elvis.</i>
<i>It's time for a break.</i>

1252
01:04:57.004 --> 01:05:00.435
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>There's something I've</i>
<i>always dreamed of doing.</i>

1253
01:05:00.569 --> 01:05:05.770
<i>What's it like to swap places</i>
<i>with the king of radio?</i>

1254
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:10.937
<i>Ahh!</i>

1255
01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:13.770
<i>Now I have a beautiful voice.</i>

1256
01:05:16.904 --> 01:05:19.737
He's in the studio.
Oh. fuck. Mary. Steve.

1257
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:21.235
Go!

<i>Finally. someone loyal.</i>

1261
01:05:28.502 --> 01:05:30.335
He's powered off
the elevators.

1262
01:05:30.469 --> 01:05:34.369
<i>Oh. Elvis. I'm sorry.</i>
<i>The elevators seem</i>
<i>to be out of order.</i>

1263

<i>Just can't catch a break. huh?</i>

1264
01:05:36.803 --> 01:05:37.870
Fuck.

<i>Take your time. Elvis.</i>
<i>Just don't be late.</i>

1277
01:06:06.036 --> 01:06:07.703
Thirteen minutes.

1278
01:06:21.036 --> 01:06:22.335
It's loaded.

1279
01:06:22.469 --> 01:06:24.904
I can't... I can't.

1280
01:06:25.036 --> 01:06:26.335
Hey. Dylan. pull it together.

1281
01:06:26.469 --> 01:06:28.737
You can't slack off now.
I need you. boy.

1282
01:06:30.004 --> 01:06:32.570
Put down your weapon. now!

1283
01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:50.069
Officer. this is
all a misunderstanding.

1284
01:06:52.103 --> 01:06:54.235
Everything's fine.

1285
01:06:54.369 --> 01:06:57.570
I don't have time to explain.
I gotta go upstairs.

1286
01:06:57.703 --> 01:07:00.004
There's a madman up there
with my wife and daughter!

1287
01:07:00.136 --> 01:07:02.069
I said
put down your weapons!

1288
01:07:02.203 --> 01:07:03.770
It's Elvis.

1289
01:07:05.004 --> 01:07:06.737
It's the radio star.

1290
01:07:08.136 --> 01:07:10.136
You're gonna screw
everything up. Officer.

1291
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:12.169
I'm really sorry.
but I gotta go.

1292
01:07:12.302 --> 01:07:13.703
Don't move!

1293
01:07:14.837 --> 01:07:17.637
Dispatch.
I have two individuals.
one armed.

1294
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:19.970
at the bottom
of the KLAT-FM building.

1295
01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:22.469
There's one man down.
Requesting backup.

1296
01:07:22.603 --> 01:07:25.036
You haven't heard. or what?

1297
01:07:25.169 --> 01:07:28.537
Why don't you call one
of your higher-IQ buddies
at the station?

1298
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:30.970
We're being attacked
by a madman.

1299
01:07:31.103 --> 01:07:32.570
I'm not talkin' to you!

1300
01:07:32.703 --> 01:07:34.970
You're gonna put down
that weapon.
I'm coming in.

1301
01:07:35.103 --> 01:07:36.402
Don't. You can't come in.

1302
01:07:38.269 --> 01:07:39.970
Oh. I'm coming in.

1303
01:07:40.103 --> 01:07:41.803
Everything's gonna
be just fine.

1304
01:07:41.937 --> 01:07:43.637
No. please. please don't.

1305
01:07:48.169 --> 01:07:49.570
Don't-- Don't touch that door!

- Put down your fuckin' weapons!
- Elvis!

1307
01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:54.670
Do as he says.

1308
01:07:54.803 --> 01:07:55.904
Huh?

1309
01:07:56.036 --> 01:07:58.670
Okay. okay!
I'm putting it down.

1310
01:08:07.604 --> 01:08:10.005
Back away from the door
or we all die!

1311
01:08:10.137 --> 01:08:11.938

1314
01:08:17.871 --> 01:08:19.403
<i>Do not enter the building.</i>

<i>Backup will arrive</i>
<i>in two minutes.</i>

Copy that.
What should I do?

1317
01:08:23.303 --> 01:08:24.738
<i>Nothing. You stay put.</i>

1318
01:08:24.871 --> 01:08:26.704
<i>The situation</i>
<i>is extremely dangerous.</i>

1319
01:08:26.838 --> 01:08:30.204
<i>Dispatch is handling it.</i>
<i>SWAT is on its way.</i>

1320
01:08:54.971 --> 01:08:57.671
<i>Freeze! Stop moving!</i>

1321
01:08:59.303 --> 01:09:01.270
<i>Hey. you guys deaf or what?</i>
<i>I said stop.</i>

1322
01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:03.037
Okay. okay. we're stopped.

1323
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:06.671
We're gonna sit down
right here. okay?

1324
01:09:06.804 --> 01:09:08.037
<i>Good.</i>
Okay.

1325
01:09:08.170 --> 01:09:10.303
Oh. fuck!

1326
01:09:10.437 --> 01:09:13.571
<i>Now. as much as</i>
<i>I'm enjoying watching you</i>
<i>scurry around like mice.</i>

1327
01:09:13.704 --> 01:09:16.370
<i>I wonder if our listeners</i>
<i>aren't getting a little bored.</i>

1328
01:09:16.504 --> 01:09:18.370
<i>So let's play a game.</i>

1329
01:09:18.504 --> 01:09:20.838
<i>I've stopped the clock.</i>
<i>and I'm going to</i>
<i>give you the chance</i>

1330

<i>to win ten bonus minutes!</i>

1331
01:09:23.538 --> 01:09:26.137
<i>All you have to do</i>
<i>is crack the code.</i>

1332
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:29.070
What code?
<i>Oh. it's simple.</i>

1333
01:09:29.204 --> 01:09:30.504
<i>You have four people</i>
<i>on your team.</i>

1334

<i>And then there's Dylan and you.</i>

1337
01:09:37.303 --> 01:09:38.738
<i>Four players. four chances.</i>

1338
01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:40.704
<i>I'm going to give you</i>
<i>three numbers.</i>

1339
01:09:40.838 --> 01:09:42.704
<i>and you have to find</i>
<i>the correct order.</i>

1340
01:09:42.838 --> 01:09:45.104
<i>If you don't.</i>
<i>you lose ten minutes</i>

1341
01:09:45.236 --> 01:09:47.371
<i>and one of you</i>
<i>will be disciplined.</i>

1342
01:09:47.504 --> 01:09:49.437
Gary. I don't wanna play
this fucking game.

1343
01:09:49.571 --> 01:09:51.538
<i>Shut your mouth and play!</i>

1344
01:09:51.671 --> 01:09:54.037
Okay. okay. calm down.
Keep your shorts on.

1345
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:55.236
<i>Excellent!</i>

1346
01:09:55.371 --> 01:09:56.604
<i>Let's start with Steven.</i>

1347
01:09:56.738 --> 01:09:58.404
<i>Come on over</i>
<i>to the microphone. Steven.</i>

1348
01:09:58.538 --> 01:10:02.771
These are the numbers:
One. two and three.

1349
01:10:02.905 --> 01:10:04.504
What order do you want to try?

1350
01:10:04.638 --> 01:10:07.371
<i>Don't come up!</i>
<i>He's crazy! It's a trap!</i>

1351
01:10:07.504 --> 01:10:08.804
<i>It's a fuckin' trap!</i>

1352
01:10:14.137 --> 01:10:16.371
<i>You guys aren't off</i>
<i>to a very good start.</i>

1353
01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:18.938
<i>Fortunately Steven</i>
<i>won't be opening his mouth</i>

1354
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:20.704
<i>to talk any more shit.</i>

1355
01:10:20.838 --> 01:10:24.971
It's time to move on
to the second member
of your team-- Mary.

1356
01:10:25.104 --> 01:10:26.236
Come on down.

1357
01:10:26.371 --> 01:10:28.236
<i>Remember.</i>
<i>we have three numbers:</i>

1358
01:10:28.371 --> 01:10:30.571
<i>One. two and three.</i>

1359
01:10:30.704 --> 01:10:33.204
<i>Well. Mary.</i>
<i>you'd better not screw this up.</i>

1360
01:10:33.337 --> 01:10:36.303
<i>Steven has endangered the team</i>
<i>by acting like an asshole.</i>

1361
01:10:36.437 --> 01:10:39.404
<i>So think hard now.</i>
<i>Mary. and...</i>

1362
01:10:40.104 --> 01:10:41.671
<i>Three...</i>

1363
01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:44.037
<i>two... one.</i>

1364
01:10:48.337 --> 01:10:50.070
<i>No dice!</i>

1365
01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:51.236
<i>But well played.</i>

1366
01:10:51.371 --> 01:10:52.304
<i>Two more chances.</i>

1367
01:10:52.437 --> 01:10:54.738
<i>Elvis. over to you.</i>

1368
01:10:55.204 --> 01:10:56.671
Two. three. one.

1369
01:11:02.804 --> 01:11:06.236
<i>Nope!</i>
<i>So. it's not two. three. one.</i>
<i>It's not three. two. one.</i>

1370
01:11:06.371 --> 01:11:08.404
<i>Don't shit yourself. Dylan.</i>

1371
01:11:08.538 --> 01:11:11.971
<i>Mathematically.</i>
<i>there are only four</i>
<i>possible combinations left.</i>

1372
01:11:12.104 --> 01:11:13.905
<i>It's your turn.</i>

1373
01:11:15.137 --> 01:11:17.838
<i>I'm not gonna tell you</i>
<i>what I've got planned</i>
<i>if you lose</i>

1374
01:11:17.971 --> 01:11:20.070
<i>because I don't wanna put</i>
<i>too much pressure on you.</i>

1375
01:11:20.204 --> 01:11:22.971
<i>but. uh. if you don't</i>
<i>crack that code.</i>

1376
01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:25.070
<i>Mary might not thank you.</i>

1377
01:11:28.137 --> 01:11:29.571
<i>Well?</i>

1378
01:11:33.437 --> 01:11:34.638
One...

1379
01:11:35.738 --> 01:11:37.271
three...

1380
01:11:38.938 --> 01:11:40.471
two.

1381
01:11:44.170 --> 01:11:47.771
<i>Bravo!</i>
<i>One. three. two is correct!</i>

1382
01:11:47.905 --> 01:11:49.170
<i>You've won an extra...</i>

1383
01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:51.037
<i>You can take your time</i>
<i>coming upstairs.</i>

1384
01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:53.671
<i>I'll be waiting for you</i>
<i>to music.</i>

1385
01:11:53.804 --> 01:11:56.804
<i>Maestro. take it away!</i>

1386
01:11:58.905 --> 01:12:00.170
Wait. wait!

1387
01:12:00.304 --> 01:12:02.437
There's no time.
We gotta go.

1388
01:12:02.571 --> 01:12:03.471
I'm dead.

1389
01:12:03.604 --> 01:12:05.170
If we reach the top
out of breath.

1390
01:12:05.304 --> 01:12:06.472
we'll be good for nothing.

1391
01:12:06.605 --> 01:12:08.338
Steven's right. it's a trap.

1392
01:12:08.472 --> 01:12:11.805
Stairs. corridors--
Gary's got it all figured out.

1393
01:12:11.939 --> 01:12:14.605
You're right. we'll be walking
right into the lion's den.

1394
01:12:14.739 --> 01:12:16.639
From the start. he's wanted you
to go down to reception.

1395
01:12:16.772 --> 01:12:18.539
He knew you'd stop
at the video room on the way

1396
01:12:18.672 --> 01:12:20.472
and he knew he could take
your place at the microphone

1397
01:12:20.605 --> 01:12:22.872
and still make you
come back up-- why?

1398
01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:24.572
Why? 'Cause he's having fun.

1399
01:12:24.705 --> 01:12:26.171
He wants me to suffer.

1400
01:12:26.305 --> 01:12:28.472
Most lunatics don't see
their crazy plans through.

1401
01:12:28.605 --> 01:12:32.338
but this guy.
we got ahold of a bona fide
psychopathic killer.

1402
01:12:32.472 --> 01:12:35.238
I'm sorry I dragged you
into this. kid. really I am.

1403
01:12:35.372 --> 01:12:37.138
but we gotta go.
there's nothing else for it.

1404
01:12:37.272 --> 01:12:39.472
What's gonna happen up there?
I don't know.

1405
01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:41.972
He'll be expecting us to come
through the stairway door.

1406
01:12:42.105 --> 01:12:43.539
and then he'll probably...

1407
01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:45.405
Fuck.

1408
01:12:45.539 --> 01:12:47.105
We got to find a different way.

1409
01:12:47.238 --> 01:12:48.839
Oh... Oh.

1410
01:12:48.972 --> 01:12:50.272
Oh. come on!

1411
01:13:08.972 --> 01:13:12.372
It's not there. We've
still got one floor to go.

1412
01:13:12.505 --> 01:13:13.705
Yeah.

1413
01:13:18.338 --> 01:13:20.071
Okay.

1414
01:13:31.839 --> 01:13:33.472
Come on. kid.

1415
01:14:17.071 --> 01:14:18.472
Okay.

1416
01:14:21.739 --> 01:14:23.672
Oh. shit!

1417
01:14:23.805 --> 01:14:27.772
Ah. the dulcet tones of opera
never did anybody any harm.

1418
01:14:27.906 --> 01:14:30.405
Let's take a moment to catch up

1419
01:14:30.539 --> 01:14:34.472
with our favorite idiot. Elvis.

1420
01:14:34.605 --> 01:14:36.972
I don't see Olivia
or Adria anywhere.

1421
01:14:37.106 --> 01:14:38.505
but he's got Mary tied up.

1422
01:14:38.639 --> 01:14:42.672
Fuck. Okay.
Now he's probably
expecting us to...

1423
01:14:46.839 --> 01:14:49.272
Oh. fuck!

1424
01:14:51.405 --> 01:14:52.672
Fuck!

1425
01:14:53.372 --> 01:14:55.206
This is my fault.

1426
01:14:55.939 --> 01:14:57.772
I told him to come up here.

1427
01:14:59.338 --> 01:15:02.072
He's expecting us
to come from the stairway.

1428
01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:04.805
We'll run in this door.
get in behind him.

1429
01:15:04.939 --> 01:15:06.572
we'll jump him. and then...

1430
01:15:06.705 --> 01:15:09.739
What?
I don't think I can do this.

1431
01:15:11.639 --> 01:15:13.772
Okay. okay. Listen.

1432
01:15:13.906 --> 01:15:15.672
Look. you take this.
all right?

1433
01:15:15.805 --> 01:15:18.238
You're gonna need it more.
Give me the box cutter.

1434
01:15:18.372 --> 01:15:20.272
And then we'll both...

1435
01:15:20.405 --> 01:15:22.705
Well. I'll go in.
I'll get control of him.

1436
01:15:22.839 --> 01:15:25.539
You run around the back
to the other door

1437
01:15:25.672 --> 01:15:27.872
and get the drop on him
that way. okay.

1438
01:15:28.006 --> 01:15:30.006
and try and find
my family. all right?

1439
01:15:30.139 --> 01:15:31.405
Okay.
Okay.

1440
01:15:31.539 --> 01:15:33.206
You ready?
I'm depending on you.
Okay.

1441
01:15:33.338 --> 01:15:35.206
One. two. three. go!

1442
01:16:13.373 --> 01:16:15.540
Game's up. Gary. It's all over.

1443
01:16:15.673 --> 01:16:19.540
I finally get to meet
the star in person.

1444
01:16:20.773 --> 01:16:22.373
I swear. if you don't tell me
where they are.

1445
01:16:22.506 --> 01:16:24.373
I'm gonna...
You're gonna what?

1446
01:16:24.506 --> 01:16:26.207
Huh?
Slit my throat on the air?

1447
01:16:26.339 --> 01:16:29.306
At least everybody
will see your true colors.

1448
01:16:29.439 --> 01:16:34.640
Listen up. ladies and gentlemen.
Elvis is about to kill
somebody live on the air.

1449
01:16:34.773 --> 01:16:35.907
Bad luck. it's me.

1450
01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.907
This will be Elvis's
second murder.

1451
01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.140
First he killed Lauren.
because yes.

1452
01:16:40.273 --> 01:16:43.506
it is your fault
she committed suicide.

1453
01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.173
Now he's after
the helpless boyfriend.

1454
01:16:46.306 --> 01:16:50.540
The good news is.
something's finally happening
on this boring-ass show.

1455
01:16:50.673 --> 01:16:51.673
Dylan.

1456
01:16:51.806 --> 01:16:55.273
Cut Mary loose. and. Mary.
when he does that.

1457
01:16:55.406 --> 01:16:56.540
get us off the air. okay?

1458
01:16:56.673 --> 01:16:58.406
Oh. no. no. no.
that's a bad idea.

1459
01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:00.706
You don't wanna do that.

1460
01:17:01.406 --> 01:17:03.640
What's that?
You're gonna laugh.

1461
01:17:04.706 --> 01:17:06.873
If you kill me.
I'll have to drop this.

1462
01:17:07.008 --> 01:17:09.806
and if the button comes up.
bada boom!

1463
01:17:10.673 --> 01:17:13.173
What kind of B-grade
movie bullshit is this?

1464
01:17:13.306 --> 01:17:16.640
You didn't think I was
gonna let you come up here
and ruin the end of the show?

1465
01:17:16.773 --> 01:17:18.941
I figured somebody
would catch me eventually.

1466
01:17:19.073 --> 01:17:21.673
This is my
"get out of jail free" card.

1467
01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.740
Ah. right on time.

1468
01:17:33.373 --> 01:17:35.706
The game might
not be over just yet.

1469
01:17:38.339 --> 01:17:40.706
I'd get that
if I were you. Elvis.

1470
01:17:41.439 --> 01:17:43.740
Mary.

1471
01:17:43.873 --> 01:17:45.873
Put it on speaker.

1472
01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.140
<i>Hello?</i>

1473
01:17:53.273 --> 01:17:56.008
Good day. sir.
Thank you for your call.

1474
01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.239
How are you today?

1475
01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:59.107
<i>Can you introduce yourself?</i>

1476
01:17:59.239 --> 01:18:02.606
Politeness would dictate
that the caller should
introduce himself first.

1477
01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.773
though I think I actually
know who you are.

1478
01:18:04.908 --> 01:18:08.941
And thank you
because you've called
at a great time.

1479
01:18:09.073 --> 01:18:11.673
<i>I'm Bruce. LAPD SWAT team.</i>

1480
01:18:11.806 --> 01:18:14.140
Pleased to meet you.
Mr. Bruce. My name is Gary--

1481
01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:17.373
Shut the fuck up. Gary.
Bruce. this is Elvis.

1482
01:18:17.506 --> 01:18:19.806
I got ahold of a guy
here in the studio

1483
01:18:19.941 --> 01:18:23.439
who's already
killed or kidnapped
several people already.

1484
01:18:23.573 --> 01:18:25.073
He stashed my wife
and daughter someplace.

1485
01:18:25.207 --> 01:18:27.406
I don't know where
the fuck they are.

1486
01:18:28.207 --> 01:18:29.806
And he's holding a device.

1487
01:18:29.941 --> 01:18:32.773
says he's gonna blow
the entire building up.

1488
01:18:34.173 --> 01:18:37.273
I don't know
if it's true or not.
I think it could be bullshit.

1489
01:18:37.406 --> 01:18:39.273
<i>We're aware</i>
<i>of the situation. I'm sorry.</i>

1490
01:18:39.406 --> 01:18:41.273
<i>We found your wife</i>
<i>and daughter on the terrace.</i>

1491
01:18:41.406 --> 01:18:43.706
<i>and... and. uh...</i>

1492
01:18:43.841 --> 01:18:45.540
What. what? What. what?

1493
01:18:45.673 --> 01:18:48.339
Did you kill them?
Did you fucking kill them?

1494
01:18:50.406 --> 01:18:51.573
<i>We have a problem.</i>

1495
01:18:51.706 --> 01:18:53.540
That's for sure.

1496
01:18:53.673 --> 01:18:56.339
What the hell is going on?
Are they dead?

1497
01:18:56.473 --> 01:18:59.273
<i>No. No. they're alive.</i>

1498
01:18:59.406 --> 01:19:00.740
I'm not a monster.

1499
01:19:00.874 --> 01:19:03.807
You're projecting
your own personality onto me.

1500
01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.008
Well. then
what's the problem?

1501
01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:10.107
<i>They're tied up</i>
<i>with explosives</i>
<i>we can't identify.</i>

1502
01:19:10.239 --> 01:19:12.107
<i>Bomb squad's on its way.</i>

1503
01:19:12.239 --> 01:19:14.606
<i>and this phone number</i>
<i>was written on a piece</i>
<i>of paper taped to them.</i>

1504
01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.673
<i>so I called it.</i>

1505
01:19:15.807 --> 01:19:17.706
You sick motherfucker.

1506
01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:20.073
And you're a smart guy
so I think you can guess
what'll happen

1507
01:19:20.207 --> 01:19:21.540
if I lift my finger
off the detonator?

1508
01:19:21.673 --> 01:19:24.473
We'll have fireworks
up on the terrace.

1509
01:19:24.606 --> 01:19:30.573
So. please. be so kind
as to put down the knife
and go sit.

1510
01:19:31.273 --> 01:19:33.606
It's you I've come for.
not them.

1511
01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:34.807
So trust me.

1512
01:19:34.941 --> 01:19:36.073
Trust you.

1513
01:19:36.207 --> 01:19:38.040
Yeah. you could use
a little more trust.

1514
01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:39.473
Okay. you have two options:

1515
01:19:39.606 --> 01:19:41.740
either you kill me
and I blow up Adria and Olivia.

1516
01:19:41.874 --> 01:19:45.807
or you can be reasonable
and go sit the fuck down.

1517
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:50.339
No.

1518
01:19:50.473 --> 01:19:53.239
Bruce. these explosives.

1519
01:19:53.373 --> 01:19:55.306
Can they be deactivated?

1520
01:19:56.774 --> 01:19:58.473
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

1521
01:19:58.606 --> 01:20:00.573
<i>Never seen anything</i>
<i>like it in my life.</i>

1522
01:20:00.706 --> 01:20:02.740
<i>It's got a motion detector.</i>
<i>so if they move.</i>

1523
01:20:02.874 --> 01:20:04.640
<i>I think it might</i>
<i>set off the bomb and...</i>

1524
01:20:04.774 --> 01:20:06.706
<i>and there's a digital</i>
<i>keypad for a code.</i>

1525
01:20:06.841 --> 01:20:10.306
<i>I'm assuming Gary</i>
<i>knows the code.</i>

1526
01:20:11.506 --> 01:20:12.273
<i>Gary?</i>

1527
01:20:12.406 --> 01:20:14.008
Yes. I can
give you that code.

1528
01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.908
But first tell Elvis
to remove his fucking knife
from my throat.

1529
01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.473
It's sharp.

1530
01:20:21.208 --> 01:20:22.875
Oh. kid. it's no use.

1531
01:20:23.009 --> 01:20:25.607
Can't you see
this has nothing
to do with you?

1532
01:20:25.742 --> 01:20:27.009
Same as for the knife.

1533
01:20:27.141 --> 01:20:30.174
You shoot me.
and the terrace goes boom.

1534
01:20:33.274 --> 01:20:37.707
So does the parking lot.
the reception. everything.

1535
01:20:37.842 --> 01:20:40.742
That's what I call
ending the show with a bang.

1536
01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.208
No use. kid. drop it.

1537
01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:57.607
That's right. Dylan.
Listen to Daddy.

1538
01:20:57.742 --> 01:20:58.775
Drop the gun.

1539
01:21:00.507 --> 01:21:02.541
Oh. okay.
you wanna be a hero?

1540
01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:05.875
Okay. I've got an idea.

1541
01:21:07.009 --> 01:21:10.407
Why don't we
remove the explosive vests
from Adria and Olivia

1542
01:21:10.541 --> 01:21:12.174
and put them on you instead?

1543
01:21:12.307 --> 01:21:13.775
You can save the widow
and the orphan.

1544
01:21:13.909 --> 01:21:17.041
You'll go down
in the history books. man.

1545
01:21:17.174 --> 01:21:19.474
Now. there's a slight chance
you'll get blown up
in the process.

1546
01:21:19.607 --> 01:21:21.641
but. uh.
I think it's worth it.
don't you?

1547
01:21:23.307 --> 01:21:24.975
Hey. put the vests on me.

1548
01:21:25.108 --> 01:21:27.041
It's me you want.

1549
01:21:27.174 --> 01:21:29.009
Let me wear all
your crappy explosives

1550
01:21:29.141 --> 01:21:31.340
and let these others go.
they're innocent.

1551
01:21:31.474 --> 01:21:34.440
But that's no fun. Elvis.

1552
01:21:34.574 --> 01:21:37.041
No. the fun part
is making you choose:

1553
01:21:37.174 --> 01:21:39.041
who would you rather
wear the vests.

1554
01:21:39.174 --> 01:21:41.641
your wife and daughter
or the new kid?

1555
01:21:43.141 --> 01:21:44.975
Oh. my God.
I've got another idea.

1556
01:21:45.108 --> 01:21:46.307
Let's draw straws.

1557
01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:51.208
Elvis. you get to choose
who wears the vests.

1558
01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:55.407
I am gonna write down
the name of each person.

1559
01:21:55.541 --> 01:21:57.240
uh. except my own. of course.

1560
01:21:57.374 --> 01:21:59.274
I'm not that crazy.

1561
01:22:04.675 --> 01:22:06.742
All right. Elvis.
you do the honors.

1562
01:22:15.642 --> 01:22:16.775
It's me.

1563
01:22:16.909 --> 01:22:19.208
Wow. That is classy.

1564
01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:21.407
I'd applaud. but that
would blow everything up.

1565
01:22:21.541 --> 01:22:23.174
Don't fuck with me. Elvis.

1566
01:22:23.307 --> 01:22:25.374
Tell us the truth.
It's me.

1567
01:22:26.009 --> 01:22:28.407
Now. how is that possible?

1568
01:22:33.307 --> 01:22:34.909
Luck has spoken.

1569
01:22:35.041 --> 01:22:38.975
Dylan. you are the winner
and tonight's superhero.

1570
01:22:39.108 --> 01:22:41.440
Now. why don't you
hand over that gun?

1571
01:22:44.208 --> 01:22:47.440
Officer Bruce. you still there?

1572
01:22:47.574 --> 01:22:51.507
I'm gonna give you
the deactivation codes
for the two vests.

1573
01:22:51.642 --> 01:22:54.340
Then you're gonna carry them
down to us very carefully.

1574
01:22:54.474 --> 01:22:56.407
because they're fragile.

1575
01:22:57.274 --> 01:22:59.009
Now. remember.
if I drop this detonator.

1576
01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:01.708
all the other bombs
are going to blow up.

1577
01:23:01.842 --> 01:23:03.909
<i>Okay. Gary.</i>
<i>I'm listening.</i>

1578
01:23:04.041 --> 01:23:06.009
For Olivia.

1579
01:23:06.141 --> 01:23:11.407
060877 and the star key.

1580
01:23:11.541 --> 01:23:12.875
For Adria.

1581
01:23:13.009 --> 01:23:17.675
040478.

1582
01:23:18.775 --> 01:23:21.240
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

1583
01:23:24.675 --> 01:23:27.108
No. hold on. shit.
It's the other way around.

1584
01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:32.009
Um. 040478 is Olivia.
060877 is Adria.

1585
01:23:32.141 --> 01:23:33.942
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1586
01:23:34.074 --> 01:23:35.340
Yeah. I'm pretty sure.

1587
01:23:35.474 --> 01:23:37.440
I guess
we're about to find out.

1588
01:23:47.274 --> 01:23:49.307
Beep... beep-beep-beep.

1589
01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.474
<i>It's okay.</i>

1590
01:23:51.608 --> 01:23:53.474
<i>It looks like the vests</i>
<i>have been deactivated.</i>

1591
01:23:53.608 --> 01:23:57.407
What a relief.
To be honest. I wasn't
100% sure about those codes.

1592
01:23:57.542 --> 01:23:59.108
I'm glad this worked out.

1593
01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.307
<i>Everything's fine.</i>
<i>Olivia and Adria are safe.</i>

1594
01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:02.875
<i>We're evacuating them now.</i>

1595
01:24:03.009 --> 01:24:06.274
Okay. Bruce. but hurry up.
My hand's starting to cramp.

1596
01:24:06.407 --> 01:24:09.108
I don't know how much longer
I can hold onto this thing.

1597
01:24:10.642 --> 01:24:11.708
Thanks.

1598
01:24:11.842 --> 01:24:15.074
For what? You know
I'm gonna kill you. right?

1599
01:24:16.842 --> 01:24:18.642
For letting my family go.

1600
01:24:24.775 --> 01:24:28.609
Gary. we all understand
your misfortune.

1601
01:24:28.743 --> 01:24:30.876
But you don't
have to kill anybody.

1602
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:34.910
Tonight. all our listeners heard
what he did to Lauren.

1603
01:24:35.042 --> 01:24:37.241
Everyone understands
how you feel.

1604
01:24:38.209 --> 01:24:39.976
If you keep Elvis alive.

1605
01:24:40.109 --> 01:24:42.109
he'll have to live with himself.

1606
01:24:43.075 --> 01:24:46.709
After all. he's to blame
for everyone who died tonight.

1607
01:24:48.042 --> 01:24:49.543
- We can agree on that.
- Exactly.

1608
01:24:49.676 --> 01:24:51.543
This is all his fault.
He's the one to blame.

1609
01:24:51.676 --> 01:24:56.776
If you let us all go.
we'll remember
only your pain and mercy.

1610
01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:59.209
Everyone will understand
what you went through
in the army.

1611
01:24:59.341 --> 01:25:02.509
The public
will be on your side.

1612
01:25:03.175 --> 01:25:04.609
But if you kill him.

1613
01:25:04.743 --> 01:25:06.109
that'll end it all.

1614
01:25:06.241 --> 01:25:09.308
If Lauren were here.
right at this moment.

1615
01:25:09.442 --> 01:25:12.609
she'd tell you
that you did well.

1616
01:25:16.341 --> 01:25:18.543
Elvis has played
some nasty tricks on me too.

1617
01:25:18.676 --> 01:25:22.209
The worst jokes since I
started working here.

1618
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:24.743
I can imagine
what Lauren felt.

1619
01:25:24.876 --> 01:25:26.743
Really. Thank you.

1620
01:25:26.876 --> 01:25:28.743
You've got the message out.

1621
01:25:29.676 --> 01:25:32.609
Tomorrow Elvis won't
have a show anymore.

1622
01:25:33.476 --> 01:25:35.809
But that's it.
That's enough.

1623
01:25:35.943 --> 01:25:38.375
It's time to stop. okay?

1624
01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:49.209
That's good. Gary.

1625
01:25:49.341 --> 01:25:51.175
I'm upstairs at the door.

1626
01:25:51.308 --> 01:25:53.175
I'm alone.

1627
01:25:53.308 --> 01:25:55.442
All right. come on in. Bruce.
and no funny business

1628
01:25:55.576 --> 01:25:57.976
or I'm gonna shoot Elvis
and I'll blow it all to hell.

1629
01:25:58.109 --> 01:25:59.341
Calm down. Gary. Remember--

1630
01:25:59.476 --> 01:26:01.643
Shut the fuck up!
That was all empty talk.

1631
01:26:01.776 --> 01:26:03.409
You were leading me on.
weren't you?

1632
01:26:03.543 --> 01:26:04.676
No.
Shh!

1633
01:26:09.476 --> 01:26:10.609
Gary.

1634
01:26:11.943 --> 01:26:13.442
See?

1635
01:26:13.576 --> 01:26:15.075
I'm here.

1636
01:26:15.209 --> 01:26:19.142
I'm not armed.
Everything's fine.

1637
01:26:19.275 --> 01:26:23.308
Why don't you help Dylan
get dressed? I think
he's a little bit cold.

1638
01:26:23.442 --> 01:26:24.709
Good.

1639
01:26:26.743 --> 01:26:29.476
I'm sorry. kid.
It's gonna be all right.

1640
01:26:30.743 --> 01:26:32.576
Hurry it up. Bruce.

1641
01:26:33.308 --> 01:26:35.509
Now. on vest number one.

1642
01:26:35.643 --> 01:26:38.676
enter 040478.

1643
01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:56.676
Vest number two.

1644
01:26:56.809 --> 01:27:02.042
060877.

1645
01:27:08.776 --> 01:27:12.209
Okay. Gary.
This whole place
is surrounded.

1646
01:27:12.342 --> 01:27:14.543
We all want this
to end well.

1647
01:27:17.442 --> 01:27:19.075
We'd like
to offer you a deal.

1648
01:27:21.676 --> 01:27:23.643
Boring!

1649
01:27:23.776 --> 01:27:25.175
God! Oh!

1650
01:27:25.309 --> 01:27:28.476
I just... I just don't know
how this can end. guys.

1651
01:27:29.209 --> 01:27:30.943
It's not looking good. though.
is it?

1652
01:27:31.075 --> 01:27:32.843
Not looking good at all.

1653
01:27:33.442 --> 01:27:35.709
You know what? Fuck it.

1654
01:27:35.843 --> 01:27:38.809
Let's free our listeners
from this never-ending show.

1655
01:27:40.209 --> 01:27:44.342
Elvis. let me just say
you are the world's
worst fucking radio host.

1656
01:27:45.809 --> 01:27:47.743
Now let's end this
with fireworks.

1657
01:27:54.876 --> 01:27:57.643
No!

1658
01:28:20.676 --> 01:28:22.376
That was a riot!

1659
01:28:25.476 --> 01:28:27.075
That was amazing.

1660
01:28:29.175 --> 01:28:31.576
How the hell
did we pull that off?

1661
01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:32.776
Whoo!

1662
01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:35.510
- I think we just...
- Insane. Insane.

1663
01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:39.911
...performed the greatest prank
in the history of this show!

1664
01:28:42.076 --> 01:28:43.243
My dear listeners.

1665
01:28:43.377 --> 01:28:45.911
I'm sorry if we gave you
a huge scare.

1666
01:28:46.043 --> 01:28:50.277
But this whole thing.
this entire thing
was just one big hoax.

1667
01:28:50.410 --> 01:28:52.844
Yes. that's right.

1668
01:28:52.977 --> 01:28:54.176
Yes!

1669
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:55.944
We were screwing with you.
that's right.

1670
01:28:56.076 --> 01:28:57.977
We're a bunch
of dirty deceivers.

1671
01:28:58.110 --> 01:29:03.610
And I'm sure his fans
recognized him
from the very start.

1672
01:29:03.744 --> 01:29:07.043
Gary was played by none other
than James Steel.

1673
01:29:07.176 --> 01:29:08.510
the king of the Internet!

1674
01:29:08.644 --> 01:29:11.110
I think he slept with Bezos
to get the title.

1675
01:29:11.243 --> 01:29:12.977
Yeah! What an actor.

1676
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:14.677
What a performance.
That was really amazing.

1677
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:17.777
In fact. it was so good.
I was in on it.

1678
01:29:17.911 --> 01:29:19.011
I thought you'd snapped.

1679
01:29:19.143 --> 01:29:21.310
Hey. what's up. everybody?

1680
01:29:21.443 --> 01:29:22.810
That was one crazy trip.

1681
01:29:22.944 --> 01:29:25.143
and you know you'll be
finding all the videos

1682
01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:26.977
posted to my social media
tomorrow.

1683
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:29.076
Yes. that's right.
we filmed it all!

1684
01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:32.410
I just wanna give
another shout out to my man.

1685
01:29:32.544 --> 01:29:35.977
who we devised this prank for
over the past several weeks.

1686
01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:38.443
The one and only Dylan!

1687
01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:45.610
Yeah!

1688
01:29:45.744 --> 01:29:48.477
And. Olivia. get your
talented ass over here.

1689
01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:52.243
All right.
that was incredible!
Oh. my God.

1690
01:29:52.377 --> 01:29:54.544
This is a very gifted actress
called Carole Weyers.

1691
01:29:54.677 --> 01:29:58.610
And she not only did Olivia
but the voice of Adria.

1692
01:29:58.744 --> 01:30:02.644
"Daddy. please save me!"

1693
01:30:05.343 --> 01:30:07.510
And a big bravo
to Richard Anderson.

1694
01:30:07.644 --> 01:30:10.477
who played
our very credible SWAT guy.

1695
01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:13.076
You really were
pretty scared. man.

1696
01:30:13.211 --> 01:30:14.710
Yeah.

1697
01:30:14.844 --> 01:30:18.410
And. of course. we warned LA
and Pasadena's PD in advance.

1698
01:30:18.544 --> 01:30:21.144
We gotta keep our cops
kosher. right?

1699
01:30:21.277 --> 01:30:23.777
So. let me clarify
that no police were involved.

1700
01:30:23.911 --> 01:30:26.944
hurt or made to look worse
than they actually are.

1701
01:30:27.076 --> 01:30:28.710
So...

1702
01:30:28.844 --> 01:30:30.610
By the way. Mary and I...

1703
01:30:30.744 --> 01:30:33.544
we're actually
not sleeping together.

1704
01:30:33.677 --> 01:30:35.211
Oh!
Yet.

1705
01:30:36.610 --> 01:30:38.410
I have a rule:
no men over 80 years old.

1706
01:30:38.544 --> 01:30:41.377
Oh. yeah. you don't want old age
creeping up on you.

1707
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:43.544
And Justin back from the dead!

1708
01:30:43.677 --> 01:30:45.510
Whoo!
Whoo!

1709
01:30:45.644 --> 01:30:46.710
Must eat your brain!

1710
01:30:46.844 --> 01:30:48.610
My brains. aw.
it's a very small thing.

1711
01:30:48.744 --> 01:30:50.744
You know you got off
on watching me dead.

1712
01:30:50.877 --> 01:30:52.410
Oh. yeah. I want
your fuckin' slot. man.

1713
01:30:52.544 --> 01:30:54.477
but you know I love you.
buddy. I love you.

1714
01:30:54.610 --> 01:30:55.944
But you did say.
"Go fuck yourself."

1715
01:30:56.076 --> 01:30:57.277
You didn't mean that.
did you?

1716
01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:58.677
Oh. I meant it.
I was kind of hurt by that.

1717
01:30:58.810 --> 01:31:00.610
I'm a big fan of yours.
you know that.

1718
01:31:00.744 --> 01:31:03.744
I was really proud
to be a part of this.
Thanks. What a suck-up.

1719
01:31:03.877 --> 01:31:05.277
I'd like to say something.

1720
01:31:05.410 --> 01:31:07.410
I'd like to say something
if I may.

1721
01:31:07.544 --> 01:31:09.310
You know.
I really want to apologize

1722
01:31:09.443 --> 01:31:10.844
for having attacked
poor Dylan.

1723
01:31:10.977 --> 01:31:12.310
Yeah. dude.
what were you thinking?

1724
01:31:12.443 --> 01:31:14.410
You freaked me out.
You were supposed to attack me.

1725
01:31:14.544 --> 01:31:17.211
I don't know. Listen.
I just got carried away.

1726
01:31:17.343 --> 01:31:19.477
I mean.
I was so excited. Sorry.

1727
01:31:19.610 --> 01:31:22.310
This is Tony.
played by Tony.

1728
01:31:25.211 --> 01:31:26.944
A very highly strung
performance there.

1729
01:31:27.077 --> 01:31:28.343
Tony's one
of the crazy actors

1730
01:31:28.477 --> 01:31:29.911
who's been working
with me for years.

1731
01:31:30.043 --> 01:31:32.410
Elvis. this is one of the best
shows of my life. thank you.

1732
01:31:32.544 --> 01:31:35.677
Dylan. we promised
to make you feel welcome.

1733
01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:38.810
and I think. I think we've done
just that. yeah. don't you?

1734
01:31:38.944 --> 01:31:43.610
But the real question is.
after all of this...

1735
01:31:43.744 --> 01:31:45.911
will we see you back
in the studio tomorrow

1736
01:31:46.043 --> 01:31:49.544
or are you gonna
just go away and hate us
for the rest of your life?

1737
01:32:06.011 --> 01:32:07.977
- Awww!
- Aw. come on!

1738
01:32:08.111 --> 01:32:09.077
Dylan!

1739
01:32:09.211 --> 01:32:11.144
Maybe we went too far.

1740
01:32:11.911 --> 01:32:13.011
Dylan.
Dylan.

1741
01:32:13.144 --> 01:32:15.377
Dylan. come on. bro.
Come on.

1742
01:32:17.144 --> 01:32:19.343
Dylan. Don't be that guy.

1743
01:32:19.477 --> 01:32:21.477
Hey. buddy!

1744
01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:23.077
Buddy!

1745
01:32:23.211 --> 01:32:24.777
You're better than that.

1746
01:32:24.911 --> 01:32:27.111
Dylan. come on. dude.

1747
01:32:27.744 --> 01:32:29.610
Dylan? Dylan?

1748
01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:32.012
Come on back.
Let's be live. baby.

1749
01:32:32.144 --> 01:32:33.610
Tell us what you thought
of all this.

1750
01:32:33.744 --> 01:32:36.710
I mean. we really worked
our asses off for you. kid.

1751
01:32:36.844 --> 01:32:37.844
Oh. come on!

1752
01:32:37.977 --> 01:32:40.045
- Oh. come on.
- Yes!

1753
01:32:40.178 --> 01:32:42.611
Probably
crossed the line there.

1754
01:32:44.778 --> 01:32:45.711
Hey.

1755
01:32:45.845 --> 01:32:47.478
Hey. Carole. the mic.

1756
01:32:47.611 --> 01:32:49.811
Come on. Dylan.
Don't get mad. get even.

1757
01:32:49.945 --> 01:32:51.378
All right?

1758
01:32:52.411 --> 01:32:54.711
Hey. say a few words
to the listeners.

1759
01:32:55.444 --> 01:32:56.811
Come on. kid. speak up.

1760
01:32:56.945 --> 01:32:59.411
Come on. kid. it's your moment.
Let's go.

1761
01:33:00.778 --> 01:33:03.778
Come on. dude.
Hey. Dylan. man up. come on.

1762
01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:06.745
We've all
had to change our shorts
more than once this year.

1763
01:33:06.878 --> 01:33:07.912
Hey. what...?

1764
01:33:08.045 --> 01:33:09.611
Whoa!
Holy shit!

1765
01:33:09.745 --> 01:33:11.444
Oh. my God!
Dylan!

1766
01:33:15.013 --> 01:33:16.013
Call 911!

1767
01:33:16.145 --> 01:33:17.678
Oh. my God.

1768
01:33:17.811 --> 01:33:19.611
Oh. my God.
Shit.

1769
01:33:33.678 --> 01:33:35.311
He's dead.

1770
01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:38.578
What?

1771
01:34:31.411 --> 01:34:32.878
We're taking away the body.

1772
01:34:33.013 --> 01:34:35.244
We will need you
for the deposition.

1773
01:34:35.378 --> 01:34:38.478
Please go home
so we can find you.

1774
01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:47.013
There are dozens
of journalists and press
out the front.

1775
01:34:47.145 --> 01:34:48.946
You should
go through the back.

1776
01:34:49.078 --> 01:34:51.178
Go home
to Olivia and Adria.

1777
01:35:18.344 --> 01:35:21.045
How many times did I warn you?

1778
01:35:22.145 --> 01:35:24.112
I told you it was too much.

1779
01:35:26.411 --> 01:35:28.478
You killed him. Elvis.

1780
01:35:29.344 --> 01:35:32.112
It's your fault.
You did this.

1781
01:35:34.611 --> 01:35:36.378
He was just a kid.

1782
01:35:39.045 --> 01:35:43.178
For years I've been
telling you to put some limits
on your practical jokes.

1783
01:35:43.311 --> 01:35:46.212
but no. it was never
enough for you.

1784
01:35:48.812 --> 01:35:52.611
I knew it. I fucking knew
it would end badly.

1785
01:35:55.478 --> 01:35:59.611
I don't even have to fire you
because your career is over now.

1786
01:36:04.913 --> 01:36:06.478
I'm done.

1787
01:36:08.778 --> 01:36:11.311
I won't ever go
on the mic again.

1788
01:36:12.913 --> 01:36:14.678
Where are you going now?

1789
01:36:16.879 --> 01:36:17.979
Home.

1790
01:36:18.112 --> 01:36:19.344
No. no. no. no.
Come here. Come here.

1791
01:36:19.478 --> 01:36:21.278
Reporters are crawling
everywhere.

1792
01:36:21.411 --> 01:36:23.112
The bloodsuckers
are waiting by your car.

1793
01:36:23.244 --> 01:36:25.444
Come on. get in.
I'll take you home. Get in.

1794
01:36:31.846 --> 01:36:33.578
Fuck. Elvis!

1795
01:36:35.311 --> 01:36:36.879
The media will get you.

1796
01:36:37.013 --> 01:36:38.444
And your family too.

1797
01:36:39.511 --> 01:36:41.578
I won't be surprised
if they leave you.

1798
01:36:41.711 --> 01:36:43.545
You'll probably
be serving time.

1799
01:36:43.678 --> 01:36:45.745
You're gonna need
a fucking good lawyer.
that's for sure.

1800
01:36:45.879 --> 01:36:48.245
Okay. I need to calm down now.

1801
01:36:48.379 --> 01:36:50.445
Max. please. turn on the radio.

1802

Dylan!

1816
01:37:30.113 --> 01:37:33.379

You motherfuckers.

01:37:33.512 --> 01:37:35.079
You motherfuckers!

1818
01:37:35.213 --> 01:37:36.947
Oh. Jesus!

1819
01:37:43.279 --> 01:37:45.014
You! Come here.

1820
01:37:45.179 --> 01:37:47.947
I'm glad you're still alive.
I really am. I'm glad. kid.

1821
01:37:48.079 --> 01:37:49.445
Actually. it's Max.

1822
01:37:49.579 --> 01:37:53.014
Horse falls. car stunts.
and. uh... staircases.

1823
01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:56.113
Kind of a Stuntman 101.

1824
01:37:56.245 --> 01:37:58.179
And we threw in
a few little extras.

1825
01:37:58.312 --> 01:38:00.947
- Like that fight with Tony.
- Oh.

1826
01:38:01.079 --> 01:38:02.847
Ah. you!

1827
01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:06.079
When Mary told us she wanted
to trap the next newbie.

1828
01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:09.914
I called James
and we came up with
this beautiful happy ending.

1829
01:38:10.046 --> 01:38:12.579
- Happy birthday!
- Mary!

1830
01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:18.345
Happy birthday. you prick!

1831
01:38:19.014 --> 01:38:20.713
You should have seen
your face!

1832
01:38:20.847 --> 01:38:22.014
Oh. you were fucked up.

1833
01:38:22.146 --> 01:38:23.345
Say "cheese." Elvis.

1834
01:38:23.479 --> 01:38:25.179
You know this reaction shot
is going viral.

1835
01:38:25.312 --> 01:38:27.680
<i>Yay! Yes. yes!</i>

1836
01:38:27.813 --> 01:38:29.279
You fuckin' got me!

1837
