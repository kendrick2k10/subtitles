00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:00.708
- Avast. you hornswoggler.

4
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:05.375
- Avast yourself.
I'll run you through.

5
00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:07.375
I'll tear you limb from limb.

6
00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:18.458
- Hey.

7
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.750
Your time is running out. Peter Pan.

8
00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:28.125
- Peter Pan
doesn't care about time.

9
00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:30.208
Watch out for the crocodile.

10
00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:32.708
- You watch out for the crocodile.

11
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:36.416
- And. Wendy. please don't wait
to the last minute to pack.

12
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.500
I won't. Mother.

13
00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:40.666
-The train is at 8 o'clock sharp tomorrow.
-Mother. I heard you.

14
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.791
I'll be ready.

15
00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:44.750
- Out of the way. Mother.
Where's that treasure?

16
00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.000
Where is it? Aha!

17
00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:48.583
- No. give it back!

18
00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:50.958
John. give it back.

19
00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:54.125
- I've got it!

20
00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:58.375
I've got the treasure.

21
00:01:58.458 --> 00:01:59.875
-I've got the treasure.

22
00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:00.958
I've got the treasure.

23
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:08.041
- Got you.

24
00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:11.916
Where is it?

25
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.416
- Captain Hook.
I'm getting a little tired.

26
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.750
Maybe we can take a break?

27
00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:21.041
- Are you forfeiting?
Are you giving up?

28
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:44.125
I've got you cornered. Peter.
Your Lost Boys are nowhere to be seen.

29
00:02:44.208 --> 00:02:46.083
No one will save you now!

30
00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:52.333
You're not forgetting about me. are you?
Michael. give me your treasure.

31
00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:55.000
Now leave Hook to me.

32
00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:59.458
Make way. Captain. lest I run you through!

33
00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:02.458
Go. Wendy!

34
00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.083
-Come on. Wendy.

35
00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:07.291
- Go. Wendy.

36
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.250
- Don't hurt him!

37
00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:13.375
-You giving up. Captain?
-- No.

38
00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:16.333
-No. you're just...

39
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.875
- What was that?

40
00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:28.875
Not again.

41
00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:32.958
Who's responsible for this?

42
00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:37.333
-Wendy?
-John. you tattletale!

43
00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:39.500
-I didn't say anything.
-It wasn't my fault!

44
00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:41.291
-It was their silly game!
-Now. now.

45
00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:43.708
-And they started it. it wasn't me!
-Enough!

46
00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:44.791
Sword.

47
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.875
Sword. hats.

48
00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.083
Nana.

49
00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:56.333
Father. can't she just stay
for a little while?

50
00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:57.416
No. she cannot.

51
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:02.291
Honestly. Wendy. is this how you want
to spend your last night at home?

52
00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.875
-It was just a bit of fun.
-Exactly.

53
00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:10.208
You are too old for this
to be the type of fun that you are having.

54
00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:15.000
Nana. Come on.

55
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:22.125
Wendy. why did you say that?

56
00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:24.500
Why did you say it was our fault?

57
00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:28.000
You're a pirate. aren't you?
It's every man for himself.

58
00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:46.416
They suit you. Wendy.

59
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.791
You should take them with you.

60
00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:55.583
I'd rather not.

61
00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:02.958
- Come along. boys. into bed.

62
00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:10.583
-It wasn't my fault.
-I know. John.

63
00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:16.416
Mother. why does Captain Hook
hate Peter Pan?

64
00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:21.583
- That's a very good question.
one that we will have to ponder.

65
00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:23.666
tomorrow.

66
00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.083
Wendy.

67
00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:27.666
May I come in?

68
00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:35.000
You really must set a better example
for your brothers.

69
00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:37.708
They look up to you so much.

70
00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:39.500
That's what they have you for.

71
00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:41.750
They need me to be their mother

72
00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:43.708
and your father to be their father.

73
00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:46.625
But they need you to be their big sister.

74
00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.375
You give them something
that neither of us can.

75
00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:54.500
They will follow your lead.
so you must be a good leader.

76
00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.958
How am I supposed to do that
if I'm off at boarding school. Mother?

77
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.333
By going with your head held high

78
00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:04.166
to start with.

79
00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:10.125
If a young lady is lucky enough.
at a certain age. she goes off to school.

80
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:13.041
To get ready for the life ahead of her.

81
00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:15.291
What if I don't want that life?

82
00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:17.958
It's what I did when I was your age.

83
00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:20.041
What if I don't want your life?

84
00:06:31.083 --> 00:06:33.833
What is it that you're afraid of. my love?

85
00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958
I want things to stay the way they are.

86
00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:39.500
- The way they are?

87
00:06:41.041 --> 00:06:44.541
Wendy. look. you scarcely fit in your bed.

88
00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:48.083
You're growing up.

89
00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:51.541
Perhaps. I don't want to grow up.

90
00:06:54.833 --> 00:06:56.541
You can't stop time. Wendy.

91
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.916
It'll march on whether you like it or not.

92
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.625
Just imagine all the things
you would miss out on.

93
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.416
if you didn't see where it took you.

94
00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:10.458
And all the things the world would miss

95
00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:13.750
if you weren't there to do them.

96
00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:24.458
It's time to drift away. my loves

97
00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:31.791
And dream of cooing turtle doves

98
00:07:32.625 --> 00:07:38.541
For when I turn to switch the light

99
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.625
I know you'll grow up overnight

100
00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:53.166
Fly off into the cloudless skies

101
00:07:53.958 --> 00:08:00.500
Where twinkling stars will fill your eyes

102
00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:08.583
I'll miss you dearly
My brave little ones

103
00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:17.833
All grown up now in the morning sun

104
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:53.250
-- Gotcha!

105
00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:57.125
I can't... What was happening?

106
00:09:58.708 --> 00:09:59.958
Was I dreaming?

107
00:10:00.041 --> 00:10:01.708
You were flying.

108
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.250
- How?

109
00:10:03.791 --> 00:10:05.250
A little bug did it.

110
00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:11.583
I don't think that's a bug.

111
00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:14.916
- Well. it's a... It's a...

112
00:10:16.708 --> 00:10:18.291
- She is a fairy.

113
00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:21.041
And if I know one thing about fairies.

114
00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:23.125
it's they don't take kindly
to being called bugs.

115
00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:26.750
-- Are you...
-Peter Pan?

116
00:10:27.916 --> 00:10:29.833
Were you expecting someone else?

117
00:10:29.916 --> 00:10:32.416
We weren't expecting anyone at all.

118
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.083
They always act so surprised.

119
00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.833
I always envisioned you as being...

120
00:10:35.916 --> 00:10:37.708
-Taller?
-No. smaller actually.

121
00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:43.916
Oh. no. I'm sorry.
that's not what I meant.

122
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.416
I'm... Well... I... How are you real?

123
00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:50.750
I thought you were just a bedtime story.

124
00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:51.833
Why can't I be both?

125
00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:55.541
I like hearing stories about myself.

126
00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:57.833
And your mother's very good
at telling them.

127
00:10:57.916 --> 00:10:59.125
Now. let's see here.

128
00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:01.708
Excuse me. you can't just
go through all our stuff.

129
00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:03.000
- Where are you hiding?

130
00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.750
- Oh please. be careful.

131
00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.333
This is very delicate.

132
00:11:09.416 --> 00:11:11.000
What are you doing here?

133
00:11:11.083 --> 00:11:13.208
One. we've to get you out of here.

134
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:14.291
And. two...

135
00:11:20.083 --> 00:11:21.083
My shadow.

136
00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:22.708
- Your shadow?

137
00:11:22.791 --> 00:11:24.750
It's trying to get away.
and I've only got one.

138
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:27.500
You're making this harder
than it has to be.

139
00:11:28.166 --> 00:11:29.166
-- Oh.

140
00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:36.958
There you are.

141
00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:47.875
- Oh.

142
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.041
- Got it.

143
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.500
Lights out. shadow.

144
00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:56.875
- Get it. Peter. get it.

145
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.041
Oh. almost got it!

146
00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:05.291
-There it is.

147
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.208
Your hat! I've got your hat!

148
00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:11.125
Go. go. go!

149
00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:13.375
- Ha! Got you!

150
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.458
When will you learn you can't get
anywhere without me. old friend.

151
00:12:18.458 --> 00:12:20.083
No. that time doesn't count.

152
00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:30.416
-Hold still.
-- Maybe I could help you with that.

153
00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:34.875
Here. Let me see.

154
00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:43.583
It's okay. Tink. Wendy wouldn't hurt me.

155
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.208
-Can't she speak?
-Of course. she can.

156
00:12:48.291 --> 00:12:50.166
You just haven't learnt to hear her right.

157
00:12:52.083 --> 00:12:54.166
Well. you're very small. Tinker Bell.

158
00:12:56.791 --> 00:12:59.666
-What's she saying?
-She says "All fairies are small.

159
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.041
-"That's what makes them fairies."
-Oh.

160
00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:09.250
How'd you know my name. Peter Pan?

161
00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:11.708
I heard your mother call you.

162
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.166
-"Wendy. time to wake up." she says.
-Time to wake up.

163
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.416
-"Wendy. time for school."
-Wendy. time for school.

164
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.125
-"Wendy. bedtime."
-Wendy. bedtime.

165
00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:20.416
But you never want to go.

166
00:13:21.916 --> 00:13:23.416
You've been watching me?

167
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.250
-Sometimes.
-Why?

168
00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:27.208
Because I've been waiting
for you to say it.

169
00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:30.416
-Say what?
-Same thing I said. once upon a time.

170
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.791
I don't want to grow... Ow!

171
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:33.875
-Ow! Ow!
-I was only...

172
00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.000
You stabbed me.
You stabbed me in the heart.

173
00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:37.625
Your heart is in your foot?

174
00:13:38.416 --> 00:13:39.416
- Isn't yours?

175
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.875
When Mr. Bear gets hurt.
Mama gives him a kiss to make it better.

176
00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.750
What's a kiss?

177
00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:47.291
You don't know what a kiss is?

178
00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:49.541
No. but I think I need one.

179
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.458
Well. I...

180
00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:54.541
No.

181
00:13:55.416 --> 00:13:56.416
Um...

182
00:14:02.666 --> 00:14:03.750
This is a kiss.

183
00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:13.125
I like it. I like it very much.

184
00:14:13.791 --> 00:14:14.791
Now. do you feel better?

185
00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:17.041
Yes. Good as new.

186
00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:19.250
-What's she saying?

187
00:14:19.916 --> 00:14:22.291
- That it's high time we go.
- Go where?

188
00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:26.208
To one place in the entire universe
where you can really be yourself.

189
00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:30.333
Where there are no rules. no schools.
no bedtimes. no mothers and fathers.

190
00:14:30.416 --> 00:14:32.208
-and most of all...
-No growing up.

191
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:33.916
That most of all.

192
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.083
Oh. you are you talking about Neverland?

193
00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:37.541
Surely. we couldn't there though?

194
00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:40.375
-Of course. you could.
-But how do you get there?

195
00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:42.458
That's... the fun part.

196
00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:55.083
This suddenly seems like a terrible idea.

197
00:14:59.916 --> 00:15:01.916
I've always dreamed of flying.

198
00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:05.041
It's the easiest thing in the world.

199
00:15:05.125 --> 00:15:08.250
All you have to do. is fill your head
with happy thoughts.

200
00:15:08.333 --> 00:15:09.333
- That's it?

201
00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:13.791
Oh. right. And a little pixie dust.

202
00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:19.708
What is it?

203
00:15:20.416 --> 00:15:21.416
What are you saying?

204
00:15:28.083 --> 00:15:29.916
You want me to close my eyes?

205
00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:32.583
All right.

206
00:15:40.583 --> 00:15:41.791
- What are you thinking of?

207
00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:43.000
Of when I was little.

208
00:15:47.125 --> 00:15:48.208
When I was happy.

209
00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:52.125
About how things used to be.

210
00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:57.416
- Now. open your eyes.

211
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.125
- Whoa.

212
00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.166
No. no. I'm not ready yet.
I still...

213
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:14.500
- Are you certain this is safe?
- Of course it is.

214
00:16:14.583 --> 00:16:15.916
I haven't fallen yet.

215
00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:17.541
I can fly?

216
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.583
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

217
00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:25.166
- I can fly!

218
00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:35.416
- Goodbye. Nana!

219
00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:22.666
- Yay!

220
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.750
I'm flying!

221
00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:26.500
- Yay!

222
00:17:45.083 --> 00:17:46.333
- There it is!

223
00:17:46.416 --> 00:17:49.083
Second star to the right
and straight on 'til morning.

224
00:18:39.333 --> 00:18:40.416
- Look!

225
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.583
I see it!

226
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.375
-Is that...
-Neverland!

227
00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:13.458
- Wait for us. Wendy!

228
00:19:14.416 --> 00:19:16.541
- Is this everything
you've dreamed of?

229
00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:18.291
- I could never have dreamed of this!

230
00:19:18.375 --> 00:19:20.250
- Come on. there's more!

231
00:19:55.041 --> 00:19:57.125
- Oh. Oh. no!

232
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.333
Oh. no!

233
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.750
He's back!

234
00:20:11.208 --> 00:20:12.666
Hey!

235
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.166
Get your eyes to the sky!
The boy! He's back!

236
00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:27.875
- Yes. what?

237
00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:32.250
Uh. it's the boy. Captain.
It's Peter Pa...

238
00:20:40.708 --> 00:20:41.791
Never...

239
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.500
say...

240
00:20:45.166 --> 00:20:46.291
his name.

241
00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:53.041
Sorry. Captain.

242
00:20:54.208 --> 00:20:55.375
- Mr. Smee.

243
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.500
Smee.

244
00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:01.875
make a note. My cabin needs a new door.

245
00:21:02.375 --> 00:21:05.166
A new door. Yes. Uh. right.

246
00:21:05.833 --> 00:21:10.416
Might I say. Captain. uh.
that will be your third door this month.

247
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.833
And it won't be the last.

248
00:21:11.916 --> 00:21:13.125
Where's my telescope?

249
00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:16.375
Telescope! Smee.

250
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.625
Telescope at hand. Captain.

251
00:21:20.875 --> 00:21:23.833
Speak not to me of hands. Smee.

252
00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:27.083
Oh. I see your point. Uh...

253
00:21:30.833 --> 00:21:32.833
- Where is he. then?
- Over there. Captain.

254
00:21:36.458 --> 00:21:37.458
- There you are.

255
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.083
Footloose and flying free.

256
00:21:41.875 --> 00:21:43.125
But not for long.

257
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.333
What'd you have us do. Captain?

258
00:21:48.291 --> 00:21:52.125
Why. let's invite him down
for a spot of tea.

259
00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:53.958
Tea. Excellent idea.

260
00:21:54.666 --> 00:21:57.666
Hear that boys? Put the kettle on.

261
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.250
It's tea time!

262
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:16.791
There. Look.

263
00:22:16.875 --> 00:22:18.000
Yeah.

264
00:22:23.666 --> 00:22:24.666
What was that?

265
00:22:25.083 --> 00:22:26.250
Pirates. Come on.

266
00:22:30.458 --> 00:22:31.458
Come on. Michael!

267
00:22:44.041 --> 00:22:45.041
It's Hook!

268
00:22:45.666 --> 00:22:46.666
Captain Hook?

269
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:49.416
Who else would try to kill me
this early in the morning?

270
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.875
Fire!

271
00:23:00.916 --> 00:23:01.958
Follow me.

272
00:23:10.666 --> 00:23:12.041
Now. listen close.

273
00:23:12.125 --> 00:23:14.208
I'll lead the charge.
you three take up the rear

274
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:15.750
and we'll storm them. fore to aft.

275
00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:17.416
They'll never see us coming.

276
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.500
Move!

277
00:23:19.583 --> 00:23:23.250
Remember. all pirates are fair game.
but leave Hook...

278
00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:25.125
to me.

279
00:23:30.083 --> 00:23:31.083
Did I hit him?

280
00:23:31.833 --> 00:23:33.250
Well. you hit someone. Captain.

281
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.250
Oh. no.

282
00:24:15.166 --> 00:24:16.208
John?

283
00:24:17.458 --> 00:24:19.000
Michael?

284
00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:23.708
John?

285
00:24:23.791 --> 00:24:25.291
Michael?

286
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.583
Tinker Bell? Can you hear me?

287
00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:32.916
Peter!

288
00:24:34.083 --> 00:24:35.333
Anyone?

289
00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:48.208
{\an8}

290
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.750
- Look!

291
00:24:56.833 --> 00:24:58.416
She has his hat!

292
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:00.875
What have you done with Peter?

293
00:25:00.958 --> 00:25:03.125
I haven't done anything with Peter.

294
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.541
Where did you all...

295
00:25:07.708 --> 00:25:08.916
Not another move!

296
00:25:10.458 --> 00:25:11.458
{\an8}

297
00:25:17.166 --> 00:25:18.166
Pardon?

298
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:20.416
Are you the Wendy?

299
00:25:23.041 --> 00:25:24.250
Well. I'm a Wendy.

300
00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:25.916
The Wendy Peter went to find?

301
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
The Wendy who knows the bedtime stories?

302
00:25:28.083 --> 00:25:30.666
'Cause if you don't know stories
then you're an imposter.

303
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.958
And you know what we do with imposters.

304
00:25:35.791 --> 00:25:37.208
Stop doing that!

305
00:25:37.291 --> 00:25:38.291
{\an8}

306
00:25:50.375 --> 00:25:51.375
Are you...

307
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.416
Are you Tiger Lily?

308
00:25:53.875 --> 00:25:55.458
{\an8}

309
00:25:55.541 --> 00:25:56.666
Which means you must be...

310
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.583
-Lost Boys.
-Every last one of us.

311
00:25:59.916 --> 00:26:02.125
-But you're not all boys.
-So?

312
00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:04.666
Well. I guess it doesn't really matter.

313
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.708
What matters is.
what you've done with Peter.

314
00:26:06.791 --> 00:26:07.791
Give me that.

315
00:26:08.625 --> 00:26:10.041
I haven't done anything with him.

316
00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:13.416
He came and collected me and my brothers.

317
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.500
Brothers?

318
00:26:14.583 --> 00:26:16.583
Peter didn't say anything about brothers!

319
00:26:16.666 --> 00:26:18.666
- That's what I've been trying
to tell you all.

320
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:21.416
We were flying. and then.
we were attacked.

321
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.583
-Attacked?
-Yes.

322
00:26:22.666 --> 00:26:24.125
-By pirates!
-- I knew it.

323
00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:26.875
-I knew it was a bad day to fly.
-- No. you didn't.

324
00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:29.750
-Bellweather. telescope.
-- At all? I didn't say it at all?

325
00:26:29.833 --> 00:26:31.583
-I didn't say it?
-- You did not say it.

326
00:26:31.666 --> 00:26:36.875
- I said it when Peter asked us
to look for... whoever this is... I win.

327
00:26:36.958 --> 00:26:39.000
- You never said it. No.

328
00:26:39.083 --> 00:26:42.000
These brothers of yours.
what do they look like?

329
00:26:42.791 --> 00:26:48.208
Well. John's this tall
and Michael's this tall

330
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.541
and John. he has a hat. He has a top hat.

331
00:26:51.625 --> 00:26:54.666
-Ooh. a hat!
-Yes. but I don't know if he's wearing it.

332
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.583
So. he might be this tall. And...

333
00:26:59.125 --> 00:27:00.375
Does one of them have a bear?

334
00:27:00.458 --> 00:27:02.125
Mr. Bear. yes. that's Michael.

335
00:27:04.541 --> 00:27:06.541
There's definitely pirates. all right.

336
00:27:09.583 --> 00:27:11.291
Well. I don't see anything.

337
00:27:14.458 --> 00:27:17.916
-I don't trust...
-She's too grown up. isn't she?

338
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.250
- Yep. too old.
- Isn't she?

339
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.416
You're just looking the wrong way.

340
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:44.583
- Oh. I see it! There's John
and Michael and a pirate ship!

341
00:27:44.666 --> 00:27:46.291
And pirates.

342
00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:49.958
Oh. dear!

343
00:27:55.416 --> 00:27:56.541
Come along. lads.

344
00:27:56.625 --> 00:28:00.000
Don't fancy yourselves the first
half-pints to be found afloating.

345
00:28:00.083 --> 00:28:02.083
Well. I rescued the Captain from the sea

346
00:28:02.166 --> 00:28:04.083
when he was scarcely taller
than yourselves.

347
00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:06.083
Of course he weren't captain then.

348
00:28:06.166 --> 00:28:09.041
He didn't have a hook.
He was just a little lost child.

349
00:28:09.125 --> 00:28:11.375
desperate to make it back
to these fine shores

350
00:28:11.458 --> 00:28:13.250
before he got too old to enjoy them.

351
00:28:13.333 --> 00:28:16.041
All right. make some rooms for our guests.
Come on. come on.

352
00:28:16.125 --> 00:28:18.333
Ooh. a fresh catch from the sea.

353
00:28:18.416 --> 00:28:23.166
Hey. That's a fine bear you got there.
Did you kill that yourself?

354
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.375
Don't you touch Mr. Bear!

355
00:28:25.458 --> 00:28:27.208
- Ooh!

356
00:28:27.291 --> 00:28:28.291
Mr. Bear.

357
00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:30.750
Leave him alone!

358
00:28:42.708 --> 00:28:44.750
- What do you have for me. Mr. Smee?

359
00:28:45.375 --> 00:28:47.083
Good tidings. I hope.

360
00:28:47.416 --> 00:28:48.791
No. not today.

361
00:28:48.875 --> 00:28:53.583
but... but we fished these little fellas
out of the drink.

362
00:28:53.666 --> 00:28:59.500
One of them is in possession of a small.
but possibly dangerous. bear.

363
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:05.666
And all three of them may be compatriots
of you-know-who.

364
00:29:20.166 --> 00:29:21.166
- Shh.

365
00:29:22.375 --> 00:29:23.750
What's that?

366
00:29:26.708 --> 00:29:27.708
Listen.

367
00:29:30.916 --> 00:29:32.333
Do you hear what I hear?

368
00:29:34.208 --> 00:29:36.208
-I don't think so.
-Listen!

369
00:29:38.583 --> 00:29:39.583
Listen.

370
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.458
There it is again.

371
00:29:48.333 --> 00:29:49.333
Teeny.

372
00:29:55.125 --> 00:29:56.125
Tiny.

373
00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:12.333
Oh. that's it.

374
00:30:14.916 --> 00:30:16.041
- Mr. Smee.

375
00:30:16.125 --> 00:30:17.250
Yes. Captain?

376
00:30:17.333 --> 00:30:23.125
What are the rules on my ship?

377
00:30:23.208 --> 00:30:26.791
As they be tattooed on me heart.

378
00:30:26.875 --> 00:30:31.208
One. each pirate upon first embarking
shall be entitled...

379
00:30:31.291 --> 00:30:33.625
Start at 37.

380
00:30:33.708 --> 00:30:36.541
Yes. quite right. Rule 37.

381
00:30:37.666 --> 00:30:40.125
no one shall say the boy's name.

382
00:30:40.208 --> 00:30:42.958
Rule 38. no whistling.

383
00:30:43.041 --> 00:30:44.666
Rule 39...

384
00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:52.041
No...

385
00:30:52.833 --> 00:30:53.833
clocks.

386
00:30:55.125 --> 00:30:56.125
That's it.

387
00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:58.250
- Now.

388
00:30:59.166 --> 00:31:00.208
tell me.

389
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.583
How did you come to Neverland?

390
00:31:04.666 --> 00:31:07.125
-We came with Pe...
-Please don't break the rules!

391
00:31:07.875 --> 00:31:09.208
Do not say his name.

392
00:31:09.291 --> 00:31:12.416
We don't care about your rules.
We came with Peter Pan.

393
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.875
And he's gonna rescue us.

394
00:31:15.958 --> 00:31:17.500
He said his name.

395
00:31:17.583 --> 00:31:19.958
Dibs on the bear after he executes them.

396
00:31:24.916 --> 00:31:26.541
He's going to rescue you?

397
00:31:27.208 --> 00:31:29.208
Well... Probably.

398
00:31:30.375 --> 00:31:31.791
Hopefully.

399
00:31:35.458 --> 00:31:36.458
- Hope.

400
00:31:37.416 --> 00:31:39.250
Most days. I hate that word.

401
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:42.458
But on this occasion...

402
00:31:46.583 --> 00:31:47.583
I wonder.

403
00:31:49.083 --> 00:31:50.083
Mr. Smee.

404
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
MR.- Yes. Cap?

405
00:31:53.833 --> 00:31:55.458
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

406
00:31:55.541 --> 00:31:59.000
-The plank.
-He's gonna make them walk the plank.

407
00:31:59.583 --> 00:32:01.791
-That a cup of tea'd be nice right now.
-No.

408
00:32:05.541 --> 00:32:07.625
- Rouse yourselves. lads.

409
00:32:09.625 --> 00:32:10.833
Set a course

410
00:32:11.541 --> 00:32:12.750
for Skull Rock.

411
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.208
Heave ho. Heave ho

412
00:32:19.291 --> 00:32:21.875
-Heave ho
-Dark and quiet are the devils in the deep

413
00:32:21.958 --> 00:32:24.208
So slow and silent
So you're swallowed in your sleep

414
00:32:24.291 --> 00:32:26.500
With a tail and a tooth
And I'm telling you the truth

415
00:32:26.583 --> 00:32:29.041
You'll be boiling in the belly
Of a behemoth

416
00:32:29.125 --> 00:32:31.583
- They're headed to Skull Rock.

417
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.375
Just as I feared.

418
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.166
Wonder why they call it...

419
00:32:38.041 --> 00:32:39.125
Oh. my...

420
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:45.375
- There's only one reason
pirates go to Skull Rock.

421
00:32:46.208 --> 00:32:47.500
An execution is nigh.

422
00:32:47.583 --> 00:32:49.125
An execution?

423
00:32:49.208 --> 00:32:51.958
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's go rescue them.

424
00:32:53.125 --> 00:32:54.125
Dark and quiet are the devils in the deep

425
00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:56.541
So slow and silent
So you're swallowed in your sleep

426
00:32:56.625 --> 00:32:58.916
With a tail and a tooth
And I'm telling you the truth

427
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.833
You'll be boiling in the belly
Of a behemoth

428
00:33:00.916 --> 00:33:01.916
{\an8}

429
00:33:02.791 --> 00:33:04.125
{\an8}...your sights abroad

430
00:33:04.208 --> 00:33:06.250
And suddenly the suction of a cephalopod

431
00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:08.750
Has you thinking twice take my advice

432
00:33:08.833 --> 00:33:11.500
A mutineer should also fear a firing squad

433
00:33:11.583 --> 00:33:14.875
Ho!

434
00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:22.875
Ho!

435
00:33:26.375 --> 00:33:29.333
You can get anywhere
in Neverland down here.

436
00:33:29.416 --> 00:33:30.625
If you know the way.

437
00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:34.541
It's particularly useful
when you wanna hide from pirates.

438
00:33:34.625 --> 00:33:36.083
Which is my preference.

439
00:33:36.166 --> 00:33:38.000
Why is Captain Hook so hateful?

440
00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:40.625
- Because he grew up.
- And grew up wrong.

441
00:33:40.708 --> 00:33:43.666
-But he's still the best swordsman.
-Which also makes him...

442
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.041
-The worst.
-Which is why we leave him to Peter.

443
00:33:46.125 --> 00:33:49.291
Who he hates
because Peter cut off his hand.

444
00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:51.750
Fed it to the crocodile.
Well. along with his watch.

445
00:33:51.833 --> 00:33:54.916
-You know about the crocodile?
-That's how the story goes.

446
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.708
Wait. you mean I'm in a story?

447
00:33:57.791 --> 00:33:59.041
- Shh!

448
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:16.750
Don't look at that.

449
00:34:19.916 --> 00:34:21.125
- Oh. no.

450
00:34:22.166 --> 00:34:23.166
Poor Robert.

451
00:34:25.916 --> 00:34:27.541
- Oh. look. there they are.

452
00:34:27.625 --> 00:34:29.666
For goodness sakes. Michael can't swim.

453
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:38.250
Captain.

454
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.500
Oops.

455
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.375
Tide's rising.

456
00:34:49.125 --> 00:34:51.041
Poor little cast aways.

457
00:34:52.291 --> 00:34:53.291
Tell me.

458
00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:56.625
What will you hold on to?

459
00:34:57.875 --> 00:34:58.875
Your hope?

460
00:35:00.958 --> 00:35:02.125
Or your breath?

461
00:35:02.208 --> 00:35:03.208
You can't kill us.

462
00:35:03.875 --> 00:35:06.041
-We've done nothing wrong.
-Oh. yes you have.

463
00:35:06.125 --> 00:35:07.291
You're doing it right now.

464
00:35:08.833 --> 00:35:11.458
I've found you guilty of being a child.

465
00:35:12.583 --> 00:35:15.041
and we can't have children...

466
00:35:15.958 --> 00:35:16.958
in Neverland.

467
00:35:17.041 --> 00:35:21.125
Rule 44. no children in Neverland.

468
00:35:21.208 --> 00:35:23.583
- No children in Neverland

469
00:35:23.666 --> 00:35:25.875
- No children in Neverland

470
00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:28.333
- No children in Neverland

471
00:35:28.416 --> 00:35:30.791
No children in Neverland

472
00:35:30.875 --> 00:35:33.333
No children in Neverland

473
00:35:33.416 --> 00:35:35.708
No children in Neverland

474
00:35:35.791 --> 00:35:38.541
No children in Neverland

475
00:35:38.625 --> 00:35:41.541
No children in Neverland

476
00:35:41.625 --> 00:35:44.083
- No one but children in Neverland

477
00:35:44.166 --> 00:35:46.625
No one but children in Neverland

478
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.083
No one but children in Neverland

479
00:35:49.625 --> 00:35:52.250
No one but children in Neverland

480
00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:54.583
No one but children in Neverland

481
00:35:55.041 --> 00:35:57.166
No one but children in Neverland

482
00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.500
Quiet!

483
00:35:59.583 --> 00:36:01.250
...in Neverland

484
00:36:04.583 --> 00:36:05.583
You.

485
00:36:07.208 --> 00:36:08.208
What is your name?

486
00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:11.375
How long have you served on my ship?

487
00:36:15.125 --> 00:36:17.750
Hey. Answer your captain.

488
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Fake beard.

489
00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:35.541
I've got to say.
it's not half bad being a pirate.

490
00:36:35.625 --> 00:36:36.666
Pan!

491
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:39.583
It's far better being me.

492
00:36:55.875 --> 00:36:57.416
Mr. Bear!

493
00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:02.000
Oh. he's just showing off.

494
00:37:02.083 --> 00:37:04.291
Oh. he's not showing off yet.

495
00:37:20.375 --> 00:37:22.000
Now he's showing off.

496
00:37:22.458 --> 00:37:24.458
Captain Hook.

497
00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:27.125
You're looking a little worse for wear.
old man.

498
00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:29.958
You sure you won't be happier
back in your sick-bed?

499
00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:32.416
Not today. boy.

500
00:37:33.291 --> 00:37:36.291
I woke this morning
with a tune in my heart.

501
00:37:39.125 --> 00:37:40.666
Do you know what the refrain was?

502
00:37:42.375 --> 00:37:44.625
Yo ho. yo hey

503
00:37:44.708 --> 00:37:47.250
Oh. brother. Hook's singing again.

504
00:37:47.333 --> 00:37:49.833
Peter Pan shall perish today

505
00:37:50.625 --> 00:37:54.041
Dark and sinister man.
Prepare to meet thy doom.

506
00:37:54.625 --> 00:37:56.333
Proud and insolent youth.

507
00:37:57.833 --> 00:37:58.833
Have at me!

508
00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:14.625
Come with me.

509
00:38:15.125 --> 00:38:16.125
Trust me.

510
00:38:16.583 --> 00:38:19.375
-- Oh. good morning. Mr. Smee.

511
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.208
Oh. the fairy.

512
00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.666
John. Michael.

513
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.583
-- Wendy!
-Shh.

514
00:38:56.666 --> 00:38:58.666
Look what they did to Mr. Bear.

515
00:39:01.375 --> 00:39:02.375
Oh. my...

516
00:39:12.208 --> 00:39:13.291
Yes! Get his hat!

517
00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:20.333
Bad form!

518
00:39:25.916 --> 00:39:27.333
Oh. Tinker Bell. Thank goodness.

519
00:39:28.083 --> 00:39:29.083
Can you help us?

520
00:39:33.708 --> 00:39:34.708
Yes!

521
00:39:35.041 --> 00:39:36.375
Oh. Wendy.

522
00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:38.291
You're still alive!

523
00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:40.958
- Yes. I am and so are you.

524
00:39:41.041 --> 00:39:42.708
I thought that maybe you had...

525
00:39:42.791 --> 00:39:43.833
- Died? Perished?

526
00:39:43.916 --> 00:39:45.166
-Been blown to bits?
-- Yes!

527
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.000
- Not a chance. I'm quite good
at not getting kill...

528
00:39:51.625 --> 00:39:53.625
Got you!

529
00:39:55.708 --> 00:39:58.791
-I beat you.

530
00:39:59.958 --> 00:40:03.666
Don't even think about helping. Tink.

531
00:40:06.625 --> 00:40:07.833
Wretched fairy.

532
00:40:08.666 --> 00:40:10.666
Very bad form. Captain Hook.

533
00:40:12.125 --> 00:40:14.291
All my bad form. I learnt from you.

534
00:40:14.833 --> 00:40:16.041
Don't flatter yourself.

535
00:40:16.916 --> 00:40:18.541
You've always been rotten.

536
00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:22.125
A stinking. rotten codfish.

537
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:28.375
You've stabbed me in my heart
with your words.

538
00:40:29.666 --> 00:40:31.083
For the last time.

539
00:40:33.958 --> 00:40:37.333
Now. I will repay in kind with my sword.

540
00:40:40.583 --> 00:40:42.875
Strike then. if you've got the courage.

541
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:45.291
And strike true.

542
00:40:47.583 --> 00:40:48.583
For to die

543
00:40:48.666 --> 00:40:51.875
-will be an awfully big adventure.
-An awfully big adventure.

544
00:40:55.666 --> 00:40:56.875
- Hey. stop!

545
00:41:01.041 --> 00:41:02.041
Who are you?

546
00:41:06.208 --> 00:41:07.833
I've never seen you here before!

547
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:11.375
-Well. you see. I'm...
-She's a Wendy.

548
00:41:11.458 --> 00:41:12.875
-- A Wendy!
-A Wendy!

549
00:41:17.083 --> 00:41:18.166
- A Wendy?

550
00:41:18.958 --> 00:41:21.166
-What's a Wendy?
-I'm a Wendy.

551
00:41:22.041 --> 00:41:24.333
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

552
00:41:24.416 --> 00:41:29.625
And I am from London. England
where gentlemen do not harm children!

553
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.041
Well.

554
00:41:35.166 --> 00:41:39.083
-I am...
-Captain Hook. I know.

555
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:43.583
-And we are in...
-Neverland.

556
00:41:45.625 --> 00:41:46.833
And this child...

557
00:41:47.666 --> 00:41:48.875
is no child.

558
00:41:50.625 --> 00:41:53.791
Nor I a gentle man.

559
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:57.708
So. say your goodbyes. Wendy.

560
00:41:59.208 --> 00:42:03.500
For you shan't be seeing him
in this world again.

561
00:42:09.041 --> 00:42:10.041
No.

562
00:42:10.791 --> 00:42:11.833
- Oh. God.

563
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:21.833
-That is one big crocodile.

564
00:42:27.166 --> 00:42:28.625
-- Look!

565
00:42:28.708 --> 00:42:30.000
Avast. great beast!

566
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:37.750
No! No! No!

567
00:42:38.958 --> 00:42:39.958
Oh. my!

568
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.916
Run! Run!

569
00:42:55.416 --> 00:42:56.958
- Tally ho!

570
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:00.208
Come on. Let's go.

571
00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.333
Well. that was fun.

572
00:44:01.875 --> 00:44:04.625
It was an adventure.
Isn't that what you wanted?

573
00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:08.000
Yes. but I didn't think that meant
being shot out of the sky by pirates.

574
00:44:08.083 --> 00:44:09.083
Or drowned.

575
00:44:09.166 --> 00:44:10.916
Or dismembered.

576
00:44:14.541 --> 00:44:17.125
Tinker Bell. I don't understand you.
What are you saying?

577
00:44:17.208 --> 00:44:19.208
What she's saying is. I saved the day.

578
00:44:19.291 --> 00:44:21.041
You sort of saved the day.

579
00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:22.541
You saved part of the day.

580
00:44:22.625 --> 00:44:24.333
And I did a pretty good job at it.

581
00:44:25.666 --> 00:44:26.958
- And it's not like you had

582
00:44:27.041 --> 00:44:29.083
-any help at all.
-No. I didn't.

583
00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:30.166
I'm Peter Pan.

584
00:44:30.583 --> 00:44:32.291
I don't ever need help.

585
00:44:33.333 --> 00:44:35.541
You have a magical fairy
that makes you fly.

586
00:44:36.708 --> 00:44:39.958
A gaggle of children to do your bidding.
a princess who cleans up after you

587
00:44:40.041 --> 00:44:41.791
while you're off gallivanting
with pirates.

588
00:44:42.625 --> 00:44:45.916
Do you really think that
you could beat Captain Hook on your own?

589
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.833
-What's a gaggle?
-Hmm.

590
00:44:47.916 --> 00:44:49.958
Of course. I could. I always beat him.

591
00:44:50.041 --> 00:44:52.250
That's just how it works. Always has.

592
00:44:52.333 --> 00:44:53.333
Always will.

593
00:44:53.916 --> 00:44:56.166
And what happens if it doesn't?

594
00:44:57.125 --> 00:44:58.416
Yes. what happens then?

595
00:44:59.666 --> 00:45:00.833
That won't ever happen.

596
00:45:00.916 --> 00:45:02.916
-Will it. Peter?
-- Of course not.

597
00:45:03.291 --> 00:45:04.666
This is Neverland.

598
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:06.500
Where nothing ever changes.

599
00:45:07.375 --> 00:45:08.416
Least of all. me.

600
00:45:10.083 --> 00:45:11.083
Right.

601
00:45:20.208 --> 00:45:22.208
- It's not true
what Peter says. you know?

602
00:45:22.291 --> 00:45:23.416
Some things do change.

603
00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.625
-We're not to talk.

604
00:45:25.708 --> 00:45:27.916
What? What aren't you
supposed to talk about?

605
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.250
Hook wasn't always Hook.

606
00:45:56.583 --> 00:45:58.083
Come along. don't dilly-dally.

607
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:04.958
What is this place?

608
00:46:05.583 --> 00:46:06.583
It's home.

609
00:46:07.083 --> 00:46:08.083
Come on.

610
00:46:19.875 --> 00:46:20.958
Aren't you coming?

611
00:46:21.041 --> 00:46:22.041
No.

612
00:46:23.125 --> 00:46:24.791
It's their home. not mine.

613
00:46:27.083 --> 00:46:28.708
Not yours either. I don't think.

614
00:46:31.583 --> 00:46:33.875
I don't know where my home is exactly...

615
00:46:36.583 --> 00:46:37.833
Or where I want it to be.

616
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:39.750
- You will.

617
00:46:43.083 --> 00:46:44.916
The first time I rode out on my own.

618
00:46:48.375 --> 00:46:49.958
my great great grandmother.

619
00:46:51.333 --> 00:46:53.333
she came to me and said.

620
00:46:54.125 --> 00:46:56.500
"Feel the ground beneath your feet.

621
00:46:57.875 --> 00:47:01.375
"so that your eyes can find the stars.

622
00:47:01.458 --> 00:47:03.291
"Hold the past in your heart.

623
00:47:04.541 --> 00:47:08.166
"but know that where you go from here.
it's up to you."

624
00:47:15.791 --> 00:47:16.791
Sleep tight.

625
00:47:17.666 --> 00:47:19.291
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

626
00:47:21.083 --> 00:47:22.375
Then get home safe.

627
00:47:44.916 --> 00:47:45.916
Hi. Wendy.

628
00:47:50.166 --> 00:47:51.875
Well. how did you find this place?

629
00:47:52.708 --> 00:47:55.541
Peter found it.
Just like he found all of us.

630
00:47:57.583 --> 00:47:58.958
- Just like he found me.

631
00:47:59.875 --> 00:48:01.125
Exactly.

632
00:48:29.208 --> 00:48:30.583
Wendy?

633
00:48:30.666 --> 00:48:32.333
Can you tell us a bedtime story. now?

634
00:48:32.791 --> 00:48:35.000
-Yes! Bedtime stories!

635
00:48:36.625 --> 00:48:38.250
- We've been waiting forever.

636
00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:40.916
- Well. I could.

637
00:48:42.416 --> 00:48:46.250
but I was thinking. perhaps.
Peter could tell us a story first.

638
00:48:46.708 --> 00:48:48.208
-What about?
-- I don't know.

639
00:48:49.708 --> 00:48:51.333
Maybe how you came to Neverland?

640
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:52.958
Or how you met Captain Hook.

641
00:48:55.041 --> 00:48:57.416
It's a very short story
and it goes like this...

642
00:48:58.041 --> 00:49:00.750
I fought Captain Hook in a duel
and I cut off his hand.

643
00:49:00.833 --> 00:49:02.458
Yes. Yes. Everyone knows that.

644
00:49:03.416 --> 00:49:04.666
How'd you two meet?

645
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.458
Why'd you start fighting
in the first place?

646
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:08.958
Because he's a pirate.

647
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.500
And I'm Peter Pan.

648
00:49:11.583 --> 00:49:13.833
But surely. it can't be as simple as that.

649
00:49:13.916 --> 00:49:14.916
Why not?

650
00:49:16.333 --> 00:49:17.583
Because nothing ever is.

651
00:49:19.458 --> 00:49:20.458
Where are you two from?

652
00:49:21.708 --> 00:49:23.333
Where's his mother and father?

653
00:49:23.958 --> 00:49:24.958
Where are yours?

654
00:49:25.041 --> 00:49:27.208
Uh. that's a trick question.

655
00:49:28.041 --> 00:49:31.208
This is Neverland
where there are no mothers and fathers.

656
00:49:31.291 --> 00:49:32.500
Why aren't there?

657
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:34.500
I don't remember my mother.

658
00:49:34.583 --> 00:49:36.125
Well. now you don't have to.

659
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.166
Wendy can be our mother.

660
00:49:38.833 --> 00:49:39.833
Goodness. no.

661
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.708
I don't even know
if I want to be a mother.

662
00:49:43.791 --> 00:49:44.875
But I still have one.

663
00:49:45.708 --> 00:49:46.708
So do you.

664
00:49:47.416 --> 00:49:48.416
and you.

665
00:49:49.458 --> 00:49:50.458
and all of you.

666
00:49:52.208 --> 00:49:53.625
Somewhere out there...

667
00:49:56.416 --> 00:49:57.416
she misses you.

668
00:50:01.541 --> 00:50:03.291
She loves you very much.

669
00:50:04.083 --> 00:50:05.750
I wouldn't mind seeing my mother again.

670
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Yes. you would.

671
00:50:08.416 --> 00:50:10.875
If you went back home.
it would be the end of all our fun.

672
00:50:10.958 --> 00:50:11.958
All our adventures.

673
00:50:12.625 --> 00:50:15.291
All you'd have left... is growing up.

674
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:22.083
It's never good when Peter
starts slamming doors.

675
00:50:22.583 --> 00:50:24.500
I'm sorry I asked for a story. Wendy.

676
00:50:24.583 --> 00:50:26.083
- Oh. it's not your fault.

677
00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:29.375
How about...

678
00:50:33.875 --> 00:50:36.708
How about I sing you a lullaby instead?

679
00:50:37.125 --> 00:50:38.125
What's a lullaby?

680
00:50:38.916 --> 00:50:42.458
It's a song that my mother sings me
and my brothers sometimes.

681
00:50:43.625 --> 00:50:45.208
I believe it goes like this...

682
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:54.958
It's time to fall asleep. my friends

683
00:50:55.791 --> 00:51:02.583
And dream of fun that never ends

684
00:51:03.208 --> 00:51:08.833
Like swift adventures up above

685
00:51:09.583 --> 00:51:14.666
And roaring fires and mother's love

686
00:51:15.125 --> 00:51:21.625
For when she turns in the moonlight

687
00:51:22.291 --> 00:51:28.625
She knows you're up above the night

688
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Do you hear that?

689
00:51:38.166 --> 00:51:39.291
What is that?

690
00:51:39.375 --> 00:51:40.875
Fruit bats.

691
00:51:40.958 --> 00:51:42.291
They come in this time of year.

692
00:51:42.375 --> 00:51:43.666
No. Listen...

693
00:51:46.666 --> 00:51:47.666
I believe.

694
00:51:51.916 --> 00:51:54.375
I've heard something like that before.

695
00:52:20.333 --> 00:52:23.750
Dear. Tinker Bell.
I wish I could understand you.

696
00:52:27.541 --> 00:52:29.375
I don't think that Peter can either.

697
00:52:29.458 --> 00:52:31.458
He actually doesn't listen. does he?

698
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Well. it's his loss. not yours.

699
00:52:39.291 --> 00:52:41.625
I'm sure you've
simply wonderful things to say.

700
00:53:10.291 --> 00:53:11.416
"James."

701
00:53:12.083 --> 00:53:13.083
Who's James?

702
00:53:18.583 --> 00:53:19.583
Oh.

703
00:53:25.125 --> 00:53:26.125
Peter?

704
00:53:28.833 --> 00:53:31.041
Oh. Peter. come on.

705
00:53:31.791 --> 00:53:33.083
Don't be like that.

706
00:53:38.625 --> 00:53:41.166
-What's this?
-- It's a kiss.

707
00:53:41.875 --> 00:53:44.708
I made it for you. so we'd both have one.

708
00:53:45.791 --> 00:53:47.208
I thought we'd be friends.

709
00:53:48.041 --> 00:53:49.875
Instead. we're just...

710
00:53:49.958 --> 00:53:51.041
Fighting.

711
00:53:53.833 --> 00:53:55.250
Just like you and Hook.

712
00:53:59.875 --> 00:54:01.791
Hook was a friend of yours. wasn't he?

713
00:54:04.291 --> 00:54:05.500
He was my best friend.

714
00:54:08.375 --> 00:54:09.791
And the very first Lost Boy.

715
00:54:11.416 --> 00:54:12.500
And what happened?

716
00:54:14.458 --> 00:54:18.041
Neverland... just wasn't good enough
for him. I guess.

717
00:54:21.208 --> 00:54:24.041
He sailed away one morning without a word

718
00:54:25.375 --> 00:54:26.708
and left me all alone.

719
00:54:28.875 --> 00:54:31.250
When he returned. he'd changed.

720
00:54:32.916 --> 00:54:33.916
He was cruel.

721
00:54:34.875 --> 00:54:36.166
Evil.

722
00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:39.250
Was he though? Or had he just grown up?

723
00:54:39.333 --> 00:54:40.458
What's the difference?

724
00:54:44.916 --> 00:54:46.625
That's why you mustn't ever leave.

725
00:54:47.916 --> 00:54:50.083
Who knows what you'll become if you go.

726
00:54:50.166 --> 00:54:51.625
What will I become if I stay?

727
00:54:51.708 --> 00:54:54.791
Nothing. Just be you. Like me.

728
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:59.666
I really thought you'd be happy here.

729
00:55:01.083 --> 00:55:02.208
Yes. I did too.

730
00:55:03.416 --> 00:55:06.583
But Neverland is not exactly
what I was expecting.

731
00:55:08.541 --> 00:55:11.208
Peter. it's so much more real.

732
00:55:11.291 --> 00:55:15.041
- Of course it's real.
It's just a different real.

733
00:55:15.708 --> 00:55:16.708
A better real.

734
00:55:18.583 --> 00:55:20.583
-Peter...
-Goodnight. Wendy.

735
00:55:44.458 --> 00:55:45.458
- Mr. Bear.

736
00:56:00.291 --> 00:56:04.083
- Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

737
00:56:08.041 --> 00:56:10.208
The little sing-song girl

738
00:56:11.541 --> 00:56:13.166
of London. England.

739
00:56:15.666 --> 00:56:19.500
Your voice drew me back to my old home.

740
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:23.291
Thank you.

741
00:57:13.666 --> 00:57:14.750
Got you!

742
00:57:22.833 --> 00:57:24.208
Where are you?

743
00:57:29.958 --> 00:57:35.875
How many times did we play hide-and-seek
in these ruins?

744
00:57:39.666 --> 00:57:41.458
You were always the best at hiding.

745
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:46.750
Then again...

746
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.000
I was always the best...

747
00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:53.125
at finding you!

748
00:57:58.583 --> 00:57:59.583
Captain Hook?

749
00:58:01.125 --> 00:58:02.125
Yes.

750
00:58:04.375 --> 00:58:05.916
I don't think I like this adventure.

751
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:34.500
Peter!

752
00:58:35.125 --> 00:58:36.125
Peter!

753
00:58:36.791 --> 00:58:38.000
No!

754
00:58:43.083 --> 00:58:44.625
What have you done?

755
00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.291
I've done it.

756
00:58:49.375 --> 00:58:50.375
- Peter!

757
00:58:51.875 --> 00:58:53.666
I've killed Peter Pan.

758
01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:21.666
{\an8}

759
01:00:37.916 --> 01:00:39.250
- I want a word...

760
01:00:40.166 --> 01:00:41.250
with...

761
01:00:41.916 --> 01:00:42.916
you!

762
01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:51.708
-I have nothing to say to you.
-Then listen.

763
01:01:17.166 --> 01:01:18.166
What is that?

764
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:21.166
Yeah. it's simply...
That's just a lullaby.

765
01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:23.583
Yes. but why...

766
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:27.250
does it remind me of something?

767
01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:32.250
-Open this!
-Yes.

768
01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:34.916
Where are the keys? Keys. Keys. Keys.

769
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.666
Where does it come from? Tell me.

770
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:39.375
-I don't know.
-Tell me!

771
01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:43.500
Why does it make me feel so...

772
01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:45.708
I couldn't say.

773
01:01:45.791 --> 01:01:47.875
It was just something my mother sings us.

774
01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:48.958
Your who?

775
01:01:50.125 --> 01:01:51.125
My mother.

776
01:01:59.625 --> 01:02:00.708
Yes. of course.

777
01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:17.416
I know you weren't always like this.
Captain Hook.

778
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.791
I know you and Peter were friends.

779
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.500
I've heard stories.

780
01:02:25.583 --> 01:02:26.666
Have you?

781
01:02:27.458 --> 01:02:28.541
- You left Neverland.

782
01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:31.708
And when you returned. you were...

783
01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:32.833
Evil.

784
01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:36.708
Yes.

785
01:02:36.791 --> 01:02:37.833
- Hmm.

786
01:02:40.583 --> 01:02:42.000
There's truth to that.

787
01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.500
But he left out the most important part.

788
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.083
I didn't just leave Neverland.

789
01:02:58.458 --> 01:02:59.666
Peter made you go.

790
01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:01.416
There it is.

791
01:03:03.166 --> 01:03:04.625
There's the sticking point.

792
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.791
My once and best friend banished me.

793
01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:11.458
all because I missed my...

794
01:03:19.958 --> 01:03:21.958
I... missed...

795
01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:28.375
my...

796
01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:44.291
Your mother?

797
01:03:44.375 --> 01:03:46.375
Yes. my mother.

798
01:03:50.041 --> 01:03:51.875
Who sang me that very song.

799
01:03:54.458 --> 01:03:55.875
Is it so terrible a thing.

800
01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.500
to miss a mother?

801
01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:00.916
No. of course. it's not.

802
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.375
Tell that to your dearly departed friend.

803
01:04:04.416 --> 01:04:06.083
for he surely thought otherwise.

804
01:04:09.083 --> 01:04:11.750
And do you know. after all that.
I never did find her.

805
01:04:12.458 --> 01:04:13.875
I never made it home.

806
01:04:13.958 --> 01:04:17.791
I never saw my poor.
sweet mama. ever again.

807
01:04:20.416 --> 01:04:23.833
I left Neverland and I was lost at sea.

808
01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:28.625
I'd have surely perished.

809
01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:32.541
were I not saved by this man here.

810
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:38.791
There I was. rescued
and raised by pirates.

811
01:04:40.416 --> 01:04:42.333
And by-and-by. I became their Captain

812
01:04:42.416 --> 01:04:47.208
and I. in-turn brought them
right back here.

813
01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:48.833
But why?

814
01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:52.875
Why come back at all.
if Peter hurt you so?

815
01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:54.375
Because he was my friend.

816
01:04:56.666 --> 01:04:57.708
I'd been happy here.

817
01:04:57.791 --> 01:05:00.000
-You could be happy again.
-No.

818
01:05:00.083 --> 01:05:02.333
My time for joy is lost.

819
01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:07.875
Everything I could have been
has been reduced to this.

820
01:05:10.125 --> 01:05:11.125
This...

821
01:05:17.458 --> 01:05:19.000
is what growing up looks like.

822
01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:21.041
No.

823
01:05:21.833 --> 01:05:24.416
This is what it looks like.
when you grow up wrong.

824
01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:31.833
You find me a child
who truly knows the difference

825
01:05:31.916 --> 01:05:33.625
between right and wrong.

826
01:05:35.458 --> 01:05:37.708
And I'll show you a man

827
01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:42.500
who can't remember
why it mattered in the first place.

828
01:05:46.583 --> 01:05:49.000
Execute every last one of them.

829
01:05:56.416 --> 01:05:58.166
-- No! Wait! Stop!
-Come here!

830
01:05:58.791 --> 01:05:59.833
Guilty!

831
01:05:59.916 --> 01:06:02.916
-James. don't you think that...
-Never call me that!

832
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I am Captain Hook.

833
01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:11.958
Please stop! Take me.

834
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:15.500
Take me instead!

835
01:06:16.791 --> 01:06:18.791
They're only children. let them live.

836
01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:23.250
When they grow up.
they'll be good pirates.

837
01:06:23.958 --> 01:06:25.166
especially those two.

838
01:06:25.791 --> 01:06:27.041
Please take me.

839
01:06:29.833 --> 01:06:32.458
Your largesse is admirable.

840
01:06:34.916 --> 01:06:36.916
Perhaps it'll lead to a bigger splash.

841
01:06:39.541 --> 01:06:40.791
No! Wendy! No!

842
01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:44.291
Wendy! No! Wendy!

843
01:06:45.291 --> 01:06:46.500
John. I'm sorry.

844
01:06:48.125 --> 01:06:49.250
- No. Wendy!

845
01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:17.666
Puhkitinin kguh weechitdaan.

846
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:19.291
Where is everyone? Where's Tink?

847
01:07:20.041 --> 01:07:21.208
Where are my Lost Boys?

848
01:07:23.333 --> 01:07:24.500
They were taken.

849
01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:26.583
- By Hook?

850
01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:52.916
Let me help you.

851
01:08:20.791 --> 01:08:24.625
A route unravels where those who travel

852
01:08:24.708 --> 01:08:29.708
Don't return from the Earth

853
01:08:29.791 --> 01:08:34.625
So take a hop tiny. and bob on the briny

854
01:08:34.708 --> 01:08:39.916
Seek the shore. forever more

855
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.416
Fair winds

856
01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:48.791
And following seas

857
01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:54.541
Elude alligator. confront the creator

858
01:08:54.625 --> 01:09:00.291
Thine eyes shall see. the mystery

859
01:09:00.375 --> 01:09:04.250
Fair winds

860
01:09:04.333 --> 01:09:10.333
And following seas

861
01:09:10.916 --> 01:09:15.125
And as you sink deeper
and stare at the reaper

862
01:09:15.208 --> 01:09:19.875
Who waits on the tongues of leviathans

863
01:09:19.958 --> 01:09:24.500
And there's a lot of 'em.
you won't touch the bottom

864
01:09:24.583 --> 01:09:29.708
And as we suggested.
you're slowly digested

865
01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:33.291
Fish food

866
01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:38.375
And following sea

867
01:09:43.041 --> 01:09:44.041
- Farewell then.

868
01:09:46.291 --> 01:09:50.208
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

869
01:09:51.375 --> 01:09:56.333
Into the water. no son or daughters

870
01:09:56.416 --> 01:10:01.833
Escapes the drink. they'll certainly sink

871
01:10:02.125 --> 01:10:06.083
Fair winds

872
01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:12.583
And following seas

873
01:10:12.666 --> 01:10:14.250
Fair winds

874
01:10:14.333 --> 01:10:16.208
Think happy thoughts.

875
01:11:05.416 --> 01:11:06.416
Mr. Smee.

876
01:11:08.458 --> 01:11:09.666
Mr. Smee.

877
01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:13.666
Yes. yes. sir. Yes. sir.

878
01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:18.041
-Did you hear a splash?
-Absolutely. Captain.

879
01:11:18.125 --> 01:11:19.125
It was. uh...

880
01:11:21.541 --> 01:11:23.875
-Actually...
-I didn't hear one.

881
01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:25.458
Nor I.

882
01:11:25.541 --> 01:11:27.375
But I'm sure one's coming.

883
01:11:33.125 --> 01:11:35.250
Well. she surely must have
hit the water by now.

884
01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:38.416
Unless she fell very slowly.

885
01:11:41.541 --> 01:11:44.916
Did anyone hear a splash?

886
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.416
-- Was there a splash?
-Mmm-mmm.

887
01:12:23.083 --> 01:12:24.708
Why that looks like...

888
01:12:35.208 --> 01:12:36.916
-Wendy!
-- Wendy!

889
01:12:37.916 --> 01:12:39.250
You have the boy's magic.

890
01:12:40.166 --> 01:12:42.875
No. This magic belongs to no boy.

891
01:12:46.166 --> 01:12:47.958
We still have you outnumbered. girl.

892
01:12:48.416 --> 01:12:50.166
Hand over hook over fist.

893
01:12:51.458 --> 01:12:55.708
My men would lay down their lives
for their captain.

894
01:12:56.541 --> 01:12:57.541
Yes.

895
01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:01.208
But what's a captain without his ship?

896
01:13:26.041 --> 01:13:27.958
Smee!

897
01:13:29.916 --> 01:13:31.375
-Mr. Smee.
-Yes. Cap.

898
01:13:32.333 --> 01:13:34.208
Get my ship back in the water.

899
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:39.458
-Hands on the wheel!
-Hand on the wheel!

900
01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:41.708
Drop the anchor! Make it fast!

901
01:13:51.208 --> 01:13:52.208
Is that?

902
01:13:52.291 --> 01:13:54.166
-I think it might be.
-It couldn't be!

903
01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:57.250
But it definitely is.

904
01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:09.250
-Peter!

905
01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:10.708
-Peter!
-Pan!

906
01:14:28.666 --> 01:14:29.666
Miss me?

907
01:14:31.125 --> 01:14:32.666
More than you'll ever know.

908
01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:37.916
Well. wake me up
if one of them kills the other.

909
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Again.

910
01:14:43.708 --> 01:14:45.208
How did you do it. boy?

911
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.541
How did you survive?

912
01:14:50.791 --> 01:14:52.791
Faith. trust and pixie dust?

913
01:14:52.875 --> 01:14:53.875
No.

914
01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:55.833
No pixie dust this time.

915
01:14:55.916 --> 01:14:56.916
No magic.

916
01:14:57.833 --> 01:14:58.833
No tricks.

917
01:15:00.166 --> 01:15:01.875
Just a little help from my friends.

918
01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:05.083
You dare to speak to me of friends

919
01:15:06.208 --> 01:15:08.833
when all of yours now belong to me?

920
01:15:13.708 --> 01:15:14.958
Proud...

921
01:15:16.458 --> 01:15:18.083
and insolent youth.

922
01:15:21.166 --> 01:15:22.416
raise your sword.

923
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:25.500
Sad and sinister man.

924
01:15:28.916 --> 01:15:29.916
one last time.

925
01:15:48.916 --> 01:15:50.625
- Oh!

926
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.458
Get off!

927
01:16:09.416 --> 01:16:10.541
Get the children!

928
01:16:11.541 --> 01:16:12.916
Get the pirates!

929
01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:19.666
-I've got the bear!
-- Hey!

930
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:21.000
The bear is mine!

931
01:16:21.833 --> 01:16:24.041
- Give me back my bear!

932
01:16:33.333 --> 01:16:35.166
Give it back!

933
01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:37.125
Don't touch my brother!

934
01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:38.916
Or his bear!

935
01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:05.833
Uhh!

936
01:17:33.708 --> 01:17:34.958
Just like old times.

937
01:17:35.791 --> 01:17:38.583
-All your times are old. Captain.

938
01:17:58.583 --> 01:17:59.583
- Upon him!

939
01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:10.166
-Michael. come on.

940
01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:43.250
-Uhh!
-Almost there.

941
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:49.958
Oh. That was close.

942
01:18:50.041 --> 01:18:52.458
Kids. give me that wheel.

943
01:18:54.916 --> 01:18:55.916
- Wendy!

944
01:18:57.208 --> 01:18:58.208
Help!

945
01:18:59.958 --> 01:19:00.958
- The helm!

946
01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.708
{\an8}

947
01:19:20.666 --> 01:19:23.041
Right. John. Michael.
hang on to something.

948
01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:24.791
Everyone. hang on!

949
01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:31.333
Three!

950
01:19:32.291 --> 01:19:33.333
Two!

951
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
One.

952
01:20:24.125 --> 01:20:27.875
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

953
01:20:40.291 --> 01:20:41.875
- Hang on. Peter!

954
01:20:41.958 --> 01:20:43.041
Don't look down.

955
01:20:43.125 --> 01:20:44.458
- Peter. no! No. hang on!

956
01:20:45.041 --> 01:20:46.041
Don't let go.

957
01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:47.625
-Peter!

958
01:21:12.041 --> 01:21:15.208
Do you know. what really hurts

959
01:21:16.625 --> 01:21:18.166
about getting old?

960
01:21:18.916 --> 01:21:22.333
It's not the creaking bones

961
01:21:24.416 --> 01:21:25.791
or the dashed dreams

962
01:21:26.666 --> 01:21:30.291
or even the sense of death

963
01:21:31.625 --> 01:21:32.833
drawing ever the nearer.

964
01:21:34.166 --> 01:21:37.416
It's knowing your best friend
can stare you in the eyes

965
01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.083
and not recognize you.

966
01:21:39.166 --> 01:21:41.375
-You're the one who wanted to leave.
-I was a child!

967
01:21:44.375 --> 01:21:45.458
- Wait. stop!

968
01:22:05.541 --> 01:22:06.625
Go ahead. boy.

969
01:22:07.541 --> 01:22:08.541
Go ahead.

970
01:22:10.041 --> 01:22:13.541
But imagine a Neverland
without the two of us.

971
01:22:15.333 --> 01:22:16.666
Without our battles.

972
01:22:17.583 --> 01:22:18.791
Our brawls.

973
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I know

974
01:22:23.666 --> 01:22:24.916
without you

975
01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:30.291
the fire that fuels me will go out.

976
01:22:31.291 --> 01:22:32.291
Without me.

977
01:22:33.291 --> 01:22:35.291
you'd have no choice but to...

978
01:22:35.375 --> 01:22:37.375
-Be a real boy?
-No.

979
01:22:38.958 --> 01:22:41.250
No. A real boy would have to grow.

980
01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:42.625
A real boy...

981
01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:43.833
Would apologize.

982
01:22:43.916 --> 01:22:45.791
Apologize?

983
01:22:48.583 --> 01:22:49.583
For what?

984
01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:51.333
For hurting you.

985
01:22:53.583 --> 01:22:54.791
For being a rotten friend.

986
01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:05.666
I'm sorry I did what I did. Captain Hook.

987
01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:09.208
I'm sorry I hurt you. James.

988
01:23:11.833 --> 01:23:13.125
You don't get to do that.

989
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.500
No. that's not how this works.

990
01:23:19.041 --> 01:23:20.458
I want you to fight.

991
01:23:21.375 --> 01:23:23.750
-I need you to fight.
-This isn't fun anymore.

992
01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:26.416
It's not supposed to be fun!

993
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.125
Oh. Captain.

994
01:23:30.083 --> 01:23:31.250
Grow up.

995
01:23:38.458 --> 01:23:39.583
- Got you.

996
01:23:39.875 --> 01:23:40.875
Don't worry. James.

997
01:23:40.958 --> 01:23:42.000
Oh.

998
01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:43.375
Just think happy thoughts.

999
01:23:52.791 --> 01:23:53.791
Peter.

1000
01:23:57.125 --> 01:23:58.541
I haven't got any.

1001
01:24:40.833 --> 01:24:42.250
- What's wrong. Peter?

1002
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:45.791
He was my friend.

1003
01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:49.125
We're your friends. too. Peter.

1004
01:24:49.208 --> 01:24:50.875
We're always on your side. Peter.

1005
01:24:51.666 --> 01:24:52.958
- I know.

1006
01:24:54.416 --> 01:24:56.416
And I'm glad you are. but...

1007
01:25:00.291 --> 01:25:01.291
- Peter.

1008
01:25:04.541 --> 01:25:07.208
don't you think it's time
we get these Lost Boys home?

1009
01:25:16.083 --> 01:25:17.625
Where to. Peter?

1010
01:25:17.708 --> 01:25:20.375
Second star to the right.
straight on till morning.

1011
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Wait. wouldn't it be left?

1012
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:25.375
-What?
-- The star.

1013
01:25:25.458 --> 01:25:28.583
-If we're going in the opposite direction.
-- Oh. yes! That's right.

1014
01:25:28.666 --> 01:25:31.791
- Yes. Yes. it's right.
Wait. we're going left. right?

1015
01:25:34.458 --> 01:25:37.041
- No. no. no. People!
It has always been right. Twins?

1016
01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:49.750
{\an8}

1017
01:26:27.541 --> 01:26:28.541
- Goodness. Wendy.

1018
01:26:29.166 --> 01:26:30.625
You gave me a fright.

1019
01:26:31.625 --> 01:26:33.333
Mother? I...

1020
01:26:35.375 --> 01:26:36.375
What is it?

1021
01:26:36.458 --> 01:26:37.875
I'm sorry.

1022
01:26:39.666 --> 01:26:43.250
Oh. there. there. Oh. sweet girl.

1023
01:26:43.333 --> 01:26:45.416
It's quite all right.

1024
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.208
And I think I'm ready.

1025
01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:48.500
Ready for what?

1026
01:26:49.083 --> 01:26:50.375
-I'm ready to grow...

1027
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:54.083
Did you hear something?

1028
01:26:54.166 --> 01:26:55.541
No. I didn't hear anything.

1029
01:26:55.625 --> 01:26:57.875
- What on Earth?
- I think it was just a...

1030
01:26:58.416 --> 01:27:00.041
-What's that commotion?
-- Nothing.

1031
01:27:00.125 --> 01:27:02.500
-Father. I heard something. too.
-Intruders.

1032
01:27:02.583 --> 01:27:04.083
- There are no intruders.

1033
01:27:04.166 --> 01:27:07.000
No. Father. Mother.
I have something to explain to you.

1034
01:27:07.083 --> 01:27:08.916
- Stay out here.
- No. don't go in.

1035
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
- Oh. no. be careful with that! No!

1036
01:27:11.083 --> 01:27:13.375
That was a present
from my Uncle John and Auntie Ang.

1037
01:27:13.458 --> 01:27:15.458
Please. please. please. careful. Just...

1038
01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.500
Who are all these children?

1039
01:27:25.625 --> 01:27:27.208
Mother.

1040
01:27:33.625 --> 01:27:35.208
Uh-uh...

1041
01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:36.958
Where on Earth did you come from?

1042
01:27:37.041 --> 01:27:39.291
They came from Neverland. Father.

1043
01:27:39.875 --> 01:27:40.875
Never-where?

1044
01:27:52.541 --> 01:27:53.541
Boy.

1045
01:27:55.083 --> 01:27:56.375
why are you crying?

1046
01:27:57.958 --> 01:28:00.125
You know how you asked me
where I came from?

1047
01:28:01.916 --> 01:28:02.916
Yes.

1048
01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:17.833
-This was your home?
-- It was. once.

1049
01:28:19.041 --> 01:28:20.625
My mother scolded me one night

1050
01:28:21.916 --> 01:28:23.208
and told me to grow up.

1051
01:28:24.708 --> 01:28:27.333
Instead. I climbed out of the window.

1052
01:28:27.416 --> 01:28:28.833
leapt over the garden wall.

1053
01:28:30.458 --> 01:28:31.583
and never looked back.

1054
01:28:32.791 --> 01:28:34.041
Except you did.

1055
01:28:36.708 --> 01:28:39.625
That's why you kept coming back. isn't it?

1056
01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:44.875
Because you miss your home.
And you miss...

1057
01:28:47.125 --> 01:28:48.208
My mother.

1058
01:28:50.541 --> 01:28:51.791
But she's long gone now.

1059
01:28:53.333 --> 01:28:54.333
I'm just a story.

1060
01:28:55.291 --> 01:28:57.625
A story told to any child who'd listen.

1061
01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:01.500
It never had an ending. until now.

1062
01:29:03.791 --> 01:29:06.583
Maybe I could still come back
to listen to it sometimes.

1063
01:29:09.666 --> 01:29:10.916
Or you could stay.

1064
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:12.750
Here?

1065
01:29:12.833 --> 01:29:13.833
Yes.

1066
01:29:15.333 --> 01:29:17.708
But you're going to leave.
Going to grow up.

1067
01:29:19.041 --> 01:29:20.083
You know. Peter.

1068
01:29:22.666 --> 01:29:26.208
After all this. I think that to grow up...

1069
01:29:27.791 --> 01:29:31.250
Why. it might just be
the biggest adventure of all.

1070
01:29:33.291 --> 01:29:36.291
Just think of all the things
that could be right around the corner

1071
01:29:36.375 --> 01:29:37.916
that you're missing out on.

1072
01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:44.125
Think of what the world is missing out on
with you not being there to do them.

1073
01:29:50.125 --> 01:29:51.333
I don't think I'm ready.

1074
01:30:05.125 --> 01:30:06.208
No. wait! Peter!

1075
01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:10.916
Don't go.

1076
01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:18.500
What sort of magic is this?

1077
01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:23.583
Who's that boy?

1078
01:30:24.958 --> 01:30:26.791
Why. that's Peter Pan.

1079
01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.500
Goodbye. Tink.

1080
01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:34.333
You take care of Peter

1081
01:30:35.583 --> 01:30:37.250
and please don't forget about me.

1082
01:30:39.125 --> 01:30:40.208
I could never.

1083
01:30:43.125 --> 01:30:47.625
Wendy. thank you for hearing me.

1084
01:31:14.916 --> 01:31:15.916
Goodbye. Peter Pan.

1085
01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:18.500
Goodbye. Peter Pan!

1086
01:32:30.416 --> 01:32:33.041
Did you see me. Cap?

1087
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:35.041
I'm still alive!

1088
01:32:35.125 --> 01:32:36.916
-I didn't drown!
-Do you hear that?

1089
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I'm floating!

1090
01:32:38.166 --> 01:32:40.000
-Look at us. we're floating.
-Did you hear that?

1091
01:32:42.416 --> 01:32:43.416
The gulls?

1092
01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:44.500
No!

1093
01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:46.250
Crocodile?

1094
01:32:46.583 --> 01:32:47.583
No!

1095
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
What then?

1096
01:36:13.416 --> 01:36:19.625
It's time to drift away. my loves

1097
01:36:20.916 --> 01:36:27.875
And dream of cooing turtle doves

1098
01:36:28.166 --> 01:36:34.583
For when I turn to switch the light

1099
01:36:34.666 --> 01:36:41.208
I know you'll grow up overnight

1100
01:36:43.041 --> 01:36:49.541
Fly off into the cloudless skies

1101
01:36:49.625 --> 01:36:56.000
Where twinkling stars will fill your eyes

1102
01:36:57.250 --> 01:37:01.291
I'll miss you dearly

1103
01:37:01.625 --> 01:37:04.708
My brave little ones

1104
01:37:06.166 --> 01:37:13.083
All grown up now in the morning sun

1105
01:42:29.583 --> 01:42:31.625
Heave ho

1106
01:42:31.708 --> 01:42:33.041
Heave ho

1107
01:42:33.166 --> 01:42:36.291
Oh oh dark and quiet
are the devils in the deep

1108
01:42:36.375 --> 01:42:38.666
So slow and silent
So you're swallowed in your sleep

1109
01:42:38.875 --> 01:42:41.125
With a tail and a tooth
And I'm telling you the truth

1110
01:42:41.208 --> 01:42:43.666
You'll be boiling in the belly
Of a behemoth

1111
01:42:43.916 --> 01:42:48.083
Set sail with your sights abroad
And suddenly the suction of a cephalopod

1112
01:42:48.208 --> 01:42:53.250
Has you thinking twice take my advice
A mutineer should also fear a firing squad
