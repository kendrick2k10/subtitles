[Rick] So. you ready?

29

Yes. ready as I'll ever be.

30
00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:13.367
Okay. great. BBQ Bill's CEO Coln
Richmond should be here momenta.

31
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:15.325
You met him before?

32
00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:18.110
I have seen him around the build
this morning it was so embarras-

33
00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:20.983
That's okay. Anyway. I insisted
that he be here personally.

34
00:03:21.157 --> 00:03:22.767
Now. you should know this
about him --

35
00:03:22.941 --> 00:03:24.595
Colin is not a big fan
of meetings.

36
00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.380
He'd rather be out with his dog.

37
00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:29.818
So make it short. sweet.
seal the deal.

38
00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:31.080
Got it.

39
00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:33.952
[Colin] Good morning. everyone.

40
00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:36.433
[Rick] Morning. Colin!
Please. have a coffee.

41
00:03:36.607 --> 00:03:38.740
Now. to kick off today's sauce
strategy meeting

42
00:03:38.914 --> 00:03:42.570
our Ingredient Analyst Zoey McBe
will be presenting first.

43
00:03:42.744 --> 00:03:44.049
Great to meet you.

44
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.529
Again.

45
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:48.793
Please! Have a scone.

46
00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:50.012
Oh.

47
00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:55.104
Mm. So this is smell
that's been enticing me

48
00:03:55.278 --> 00:03:56.888
all the way from the elevator.

49
00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:03.199
Tastes incredible.

50
00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:05.810
It's lemon essence and lavender.

51
00:04:06.463 --> 00:04:07.247
I see.

52
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:09.161
Nice combo.

53
00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:10.859
Yeah. Zoey's bit of a weekend c.

54
00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:12.904
She always
surprises us on Mondays.

55
00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:16.168
Now. let's see what
customer feedback she has to re.

56
00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:18.214
Please. everyone sit down.

57
00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.260
[Zoey] All right...

58
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:22.697
Welcome. everyone.

59
00:04:25.221 --> 00:04:28.006
The brief was
a brand new sauce for BBQ Bill'.

60
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.880
Something with universal
appeal and a fresh twist.

61
00:04:33.795 --> 00:04:36.580
Our customer focus
groups consistently tell us

62
00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:40.889
that a healthy and
tasty menu is their top priorit.

63
00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:44.240
Consumer feedback
is showing that we are falling t

64
00:04:44.414 --> 00:04:46.111
on these objectives

65
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:50.202
with a sauce that's high in sugd
low on natural flavors.

66
00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:53.989
I've analyzed
every BBQ Bill's sauce ingrediet

67
00:04:54.163 --> 00:04:56.339
and I have
a lot of suggestions.

68
00:04:56.513 --> 00:04:58.298
And not just about
the sauce.

69
00:04:58.472 --> 00:05:01.170
For starters. I'd take some of e
unhealthy sandwich add-ons --

70
00:05:01.344 --> 00:05:03.172
blue cheese. bacon...

71
00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:05.435
and replace them with healthy
alternatives.

72
00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:09.091
Avocado. tasty salsas and...

73
00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:12.137
I have a
brand new sauce suggestion

74
00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.749
that will be revolutionary
for BBQ Bill's.

75
00:05:14.923 --> 00:05:17.317
If you'll follow me
down to the test kitchens.

76
00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:19.449
I have a surprise for everyone.

77
00:05:19.623 --> 00:05:21.843
Samples of a healthy new sauce

78
00:05:22.017 --> 00:05:25.063
and grilled Mediterranean-style
chicken sandwiches with hummus.

79
00:05:25.412 --> 00:05:28.066
I'm sorry. Could you just hold
on one second. please?

80
00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:32.288
Rick. I thought this meeting wat
customer feedback and planning.

81
00:05:32.462 --> 00:05:34.943
I thought we had
our next menu and sauces all pl.

82
00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:37.946
I don't think we can introduce g
new in the next three weeks.

83
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.991
[Zoey] I think it's doable.

84
00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:42.690
I can definitely have the sauce
available within that window

85
00:05:42.864 --> 00:05:45.606
and I've scoped out
distribution.

86
00:05:46.258 --> 00:05:49.827
A co-op with local organic farm.
fresh ingredients.

87
00:05:50.001 --> 00:05:52.961
and on-time delivery to
all of your 850 stores.

88
00:05:53.527 --> 00:05:55.137
Okay. that is impressive. actua.

89
00:05:55.311 --> 00:05:57.444
but in order to make our quartey
projections.

90
00:05:57.618 --> 00:06:00.011
we need everything wrapped by w9

91
00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:02.666
which in restaurant speak is ye.

92
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.626
Your company
can be a force for change.

93
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.323
You can be the first
fast food chain

94
00:06:07.497 --> 00:06:09.325
to lead the category with
healthy offerings.

95
00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:11.893
Mr. Richmond.
this is a big opportunity here.

96
00:06:12.067 --> 00:06:13.895
Look. you've certainly
done your homework.

97
00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:16.854
but I'm not about to
change my entire product line.

98
00:06:17.028 --> 00:06:18.726
Look. I'm late
for another meeting.

99
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.206
Rick. we're going to talk
about this later. okay?

100
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.208
[sucks teeth]

101
00:06:24.862 --> 00:06:26.777
[Rick] Hold up a minute. Colin.

102
00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:28.866
I just got apologize for
what happened in there.

103
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.043
We will have a new plan
and a new sauce. pronto.

104
00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:34.350
Okay. Rick. but this is
your last chance.

105
00:06:34.524 --> 00:06:36.265
Rick. we really got a knock
out of the park.

106
00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:39.050
Not just to satisfy our
customers but our shareholders.

107
00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:43.925
Let's try something fun and freh
like Hawaiian. Pineapple teriya.

108
00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.057
We'll have it for you in a week.
Two. tops.

109
00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:48.451
Okay. but no last-minute
changes. all right?

110
00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:50.279
-You got it.
-Okay.

111
00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:52.847
-Our word is as good as gold!
-[Colin] All right. pal.

112
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:56.938
Rick. I'm sorry.

113
00:06:57.373 --> 00:06:59.419
Unbelievable.
I give you the agenda.

114
00:06:59.593 --> 00:07:01.899
I told you not to be creative
but you were creative.

115
00:07:02.073 --> 00:07:04.032
And now my neck is on the line.

116
00:07:04.206 --> 00:07:05.990
You know my strength is recipes.

117
00:07:06.164 --> 00:07:08.166
I took a chance. He didn't
even taste my healthy samples.

118
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.519
You have no business presenting
anything without my blessing.

119
00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:16.044
So you are out.
I'm letting you go.

120
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:20.570
For doing more work than you as?
You can't fire me for that.

121
00:07:21.223 --> 00:07:24.356
Are you really that stubborn?
You're fired.

122
00:07:28.317 --> 00:07:29.753
You know what?

123
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:34.236
You're right.
I don't belong here.

124
00:07:38.022 --> 00:07:39.894
I'm not like you.

125
00:07:52.254 --> 00:07:55.823
[exhales sharply] I put a lot ot
into this presentation.

126
00:07:58.652 --> 00:08:01.872
Can you believe Rick fired me?
I was furious.

127
00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:03.483
And as soon as I walked out.

128
00:08:03.657 --> 00:08:05.702
I remembered my credit card bils
and my rent

129
00:08:05.876 --> 00:08:07.661
What am I going to do?

130
00:08:07.835 --> 00:08:10.098
Maybe this is a sign it's time
to do something different.

131
00:08:10.272 --> 00:08:12.753
I mean. your true calling
has always been the actual cookg

132
00:08:12.927 --> 00:08:14.494
not the science and research.

133
00:08:14.668 --> 00:08:17.061
Cooking is only a weekend hobby.
I'm not that good.

134
00:08:17.235 --> 00:08:18.628
Not that good?

135
00:08:18.802 --> 00:08:21.152
Excuse me.
Your food is amazing.

136
00:08:21.457 --> 00:08:24.591
[Shay] Seriously. your tri tip
barbecue is the bomb.

137
00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:29.683
Actually. is there any left over
in your fridge? I could come by.

138
00:08:30.205 --> 00:08:31.641
Oh. my gosh.

139
00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:33.295
What? What is going on?

140
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:34.949
[Colin] Enrique!

141
00:08:35.123 --> 00:08:37.517
Our CEO? The reason
Rick fired me? He's here.

142
00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:38.953
Where's here?

143
00:08:39.127 --> 00:08:40.998
The food truck line near the of.

144
00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:44.001
The guy could
not care less about my presenta.

145
00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:46.917
Even more proof he's a bad pers.
He just cut the line.

146
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:50.312
Ew! Ignore him.
Why do you even care?

147
00:08:50.791 --> 00:08:52.096
Is he cute or something?

148
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.315
No.

149
00:08:53.489 --> 00:08:55.056
Well. he's kind of cute. I gues.

150
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.624
Well. you know what I always sa:

151
00:08:57.798 --> 00:08:59.756
Rise above it. Know your worth.

152
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.932
Thanks. I'll try.

153
00:09:09.636 --> 00:09:11.072
Zoey. right?

154
00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:12.769
Yes.

155
00:09:12.943 --> 00:09:15.250
Wow. imagine
meeting twice in the same day.

156
00:09:15.424 --> 00:09:17.208
Yeah. Imagine.

157
00:09:17.382 --> 00:09:21.386
Actually. three times if you can
count the... incident this morn.

158
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.519
Oh. thank you for reminding me.

159
00:09:23.693 --> 00:09:25.956
Hey. have you tried these fish ?

160
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:31.353
So delicately seasoned. fresh.
The sauce is to die for.

161
00:09:32.136 --> 00:09:33.921
Can't quite pinpoint
the spices. though.

162
00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:36.576
Now you care about
the sauce and the flavor.

163
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.144
You know. you were a lot friendr
when I saw you earlier.

164
00:09:41.102 --> 00:09:42.494
When you order from Enrique.

165
00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:44.496
make sure to ask
for the blackened halibut.

166
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:47.630
He makes special
off-menu for locals only.

167
00:09:47.935 --> 00:09:50.024
No. thank you.
But I might warn Enrique

168
00:09:50.198 --> 00:09:53.027
there's a shark lurking about
for his halibut recipe.

169
00:09:54.376 --> 00:09:58.075
You might want to water
that little guy. Looks a little.

170
00:10:07.084 --> 00:10:08.912
You don't have to be
so stubborn. you know?

171
00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:11.132
You could apologize.
Ask for your job back.

172
00:10:11.306 --> 00:10:13.177
No way.

173
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:15.005
My grandpa says never look

178

And don't tell Grandpa
but I skipped the pork lard.

ingredient. You would never gue.

Why? If you tell me
you'll have to kill me?

190
00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:56.786

someone who has a food truck.

and I need to make jam.

220

But this is a pretty good and hr
take on an old favorite.

692
00:33:41.584 --> 00:33:43.891
Oh! Can I get some
barbecue sauce on it?

Uh. no.

Uh. no again.

Come on. Can I just have
a taste of barbecue sauce?

I know where I've seen
you before.

704
00:34:06.522 --> 00:34:09.743
You're Bradley from
the test kitchens a BBQ Bill's.

Who was that?

706
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.965
That was the guy
from my old job. Bradley.

707
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:19.144
He just dropped the pie and ran
when I recognized him.

708
00:34:19.318 --> 00:34:21.537
Interesting.
Why would he do that?

709
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:24.540
I don't know. He asked
me for a taste of my sauce.

710
00:34:24.714 --> 00:34:27.630
Even though I told him
we were only serving pie.

711

-Strange.
-Very.

712
00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.548
Hm.

Hey. you guys.

00:34:38.511 --> 00:34:40.687
Failed generator.

And without power
to the electric griddle

716
00:34:42.689 --> 00:34:44.169
we've only made enough bacon

717
00:34:44.343 --> 00:34:46.214
for five bacon-wrapped ice crea.

718
00:34:46.388 --> 00:34:47.824
I'm sorry to hear that.

719

[sighs] Yeah.

720
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.614
Um... maybe chop the bacon realy
small to make bacon sprinkles?

00:34:54.788 --> 00:34:57.051
Do an ice cream
topping with black pepper and c.

722
00:34:57.225 --> 00:35:01.925
The enzymes in the pepper will t
the top note in the caramel.

done a lot lately.

tougher than usual. to be hones.

So you traded the
chaos of being a corporate exec

for the chaos
of watching Grandpa and me

chips and put out fires.

same way at BBQ Bill's.

in spreadsheets and stats

do the things I loved.

my secret with anyone.

Nah.

1022

I'm actually surprised that you
understand Molecular Gastronomy.

1023

Of course. I mean.
I do own a chain of restaurants.

1024

You consider
yourself a restaurant owner?

1025
00:50:12.705 --> 00:50:14.968

like running a factory.

expanded my dad's empire but...

not like it used to be.

00:50:47.174 --> 00:50:51.178
We went public then. boom.
the brand exploded overnight.

1037
00:50:51.657 --> 00:50:53.354
-Here we are.
-Hmm.

1038
00:50:53.528 --> 00:50:55.139
Well. you've achieved a lot.

1039
00:50:55.313 --> 00:50:57.489
And your
family must be very proud.

1040
00:50:58.142 --> 00:50:59.404
Yeah.

1041
00:50:59.578 --> 00:51:00.927
Can I ask you
a question though?

1042
00:51:01.101 --> 00:51:03.321
Why won't
you consider a healthier menu?

1043
00:51:03.495 --> 00:51:05.410
You have
such loyal customers.

1044
00:51:05.584 --> 00:51:07.760
They would definitely
keep coming back. you know?

1045
00:51:07.934 --> 00:51:09.675
Yeah. I guess.

1046
00:51:09.849 --> 00:51:12.939
I just never thought how we cour
the same distinct flavors.

1047
00:51:13.113 --> 00:51:15.724
You've seen us do it
with our sauce that you like so.

1048
00:51:15.898 --> 00:51:17.509
And it
tastes great. doesn't it?

1049
00:51:17.683 --> 00:51:19.989
And it is 50%
healthier than normal barbecue .

1050
00:51:20.164 --> 00:51:21.600
Wow.
Really. that much?

1051
00:51:21.774 --> 00:51:24.081
Yeah. when I was your
ingredient analyst

1052
00:51:24.255 --> 00:51:26.387
I did the calculations myself.

1053
00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.348
Don't you think it's
worth leading the way on this?

1054
00:51:30.652 --> 00:51:33.002
Make a mark? Make a difference?

1055
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:37.442
Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's
been in the back of my mind.

1056
00:51:37.616 --> 00:51:41.054
But yeah. I don't know how
avocados and hummus

1057
00:51:41.228 --> 00:51:44.666
and all that kind of stuff woull
to BBQ Bill's clientele.

1058
00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:48.061
I think it can.
And. besides. you can do it gra.

1059
00:51:48.366 --> 00:51:50.063
People won't even notice.

1060
00:51:50.237 --> 00:51:53.022
And if they do they will
enjoy eating the food they love

1061
00:51:53.197 --> 00:51:56.417
and knowing they're
a part of a healthier lifestyle.

1062
00:51:57.418 --> 00:51:59.290
You got a pretty good
point there.

1063
00:51:59.464 --> 00:52:01.074
Food for thought.

1064
00:52:01.248 --> 00:52:03.032

I kind of assumed you were

with no restaurant experience ad
that really wasn't fair.

1068

Clearly. you've worked very har.

Thanks.

much fun as I used to. you know?

in the air and fires to fight.

rest up for the next challenge.

[Zoey] I can't believe I'm eati.

1092
00:53:16.149 --> 00:53:18.499
Colin and I literally
cleaned out the refrigerator.

1093
00:53:18.673 --> 00:53:20.719
Well. you know what
this means. don't you?

1094
00:53:20.893 --> 00:53:21.981
No.

1095
00:53:22.155 --> 00:53:23.765
Well. you must really like him

1096
00:53:23.939 --> 00:53:25.593
if you're comfortable
enough to pig out with him.

1097
00:53:25.767 --> 00:53:28.944
I think it means the
opposite. We're just friends.

1098
00:53:29.118 --> 00:53:30.468
We did have fun.

1099
00:53:30.642 --> 00:53:32.426
He's not so bad.
I guess. as a friend.

1100
00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.647
When he was technically my boss.
he didn't even seem to notice m.

Until that pitch.

1102
00:53:37.301 --> 00:53:38.911
He appreciates
good food at least.

1103
00:53:39.085 --> 00:53:43.481
Yeah. Colin surprised me.
He cares a lot more than I thou.

1104
00:53:43.655 --> 00:53:47.833
I think he just got caught up
in the world of big fast food.

1105
00:53:48.442 --> 00:53:52.751
He... he really does seem
to appreciate my healthy cooking

1106
00:53:53.099 --> 00:53:56.450
But he has been asking me a lotf
questions about my ingredients.

1107
00:53:56.624 --> 00:53:57.973
Do you think that's weird?

1108
00:53:58.147 --> 00:54:00.193
No. he's in the same
business as you

1109
00:54:00.367 --> 00:54:02.108
so he's probably just curious.

1110
00:54:02.282 --> 00:54:04.632
Yeah. it's
been weighing on my mind.

1111
00:54:04.806 --> 00:54:07.548
I know they need
a new revolutionary flavor.

1112
00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:10.508
What if he is
judging this competition

1113
00:54:10.682 --> 00:54:12.771
so he can scoop out new ideas?

1114
00:54:12.945 --> 00:54:16.427
Look. don't worry about it
and don't jump to conclusions.

I know.

1116
00:54:17.819 --> 00:54:19.517
And if you are that concerned

1117
00:54:19.691 --> 00:54:21.345
then just don't talk about your
recipes in front of him.

Talk about other things.

Get to know him.

no harm in that. right?

Have a little walk
with me here. bud.

1230
00:59:45.625 --> 00:59:47.540
Why do we keep
running into each other?

1231
00:59:47.714 --> 00:59:50.717
This is my favorite spot.
But what's your excuse?

1232
00:59:51.196 --> 00:59:53.764
We're just
taking a little stress break.

1233
00:59:53.938 --> 00:59:55.417
And I like this area. too.

1234
00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:57.768
My dad opened up
our first BBQ Bill's near here

1235
00:59:57.942 --> 00:59:59.683
back in 1962.

1236
00:59:59.857 --> 01:00:01.728
Really? Where exactly?

1237
01:00:02.033 --> 01:00:03.861
Between Larkfield and Chelford.

1238
01:00:04.035 --> 01:00:05.689
That's right by my place.

1239
01:00:05.863 --> 01:00:09.301
But there are no restaurants th.
Isn't that a dog shelter?

1240
01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:12.260
That's right. When BBQ
Bill's outgrew its location

1241
01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:15.481
I decided to convert it into a t
Animal Rescue Foundation

1242
01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:17.875
and found this guy there.

1243
01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:21.139
Changed my life.

1244
01:00:21.313 --> 01:00:23.141
That's nice.

1245
01:00:23.315 --> 01:00:27.058
Sometimes when he's a good boy.
I get a little doggie ice cream.

1246
01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:29.887
Something tells me
he's a good boy a lot.

1247
01:00:30.061 --> 01:00:31.540
Well. you know.
you shouldn't eat alone

1248
01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:33.368
and who can say no
to ice cream. right?

1249
01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:34.543
Wouldn't be polite.

1250
01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:35.893
True.

1251
01:00:36.763 --> 01:00:38.809

You are different
than I thought.

Yeah. I get that a lot.

1269
01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:27.596
I was never really cut
out to be businessman.

1270
01:01:28.249 --> 01:01:32.166
I was happy to take
over my dad's dream but...

1271
01:01:32.993 --> 01:01:35.779
BBQ Bill's
got too big too fast.

1272

in wolf's clothing.

I try to talk the talk.
but it's not really me.

No. you walk the walk.

1276

I see that now.
Well. this is my street.

enjoy that. Right. bud?

for this challenge.

1376
01:06:36.644 --> 01:06:39.517
And besides. you have been
asking me about Jesse non-stop

1377
01:06:39.691 --> 01:06:41.736
and I think he's into you too.

1378
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:43.608
So what better way
to find out?

1379
01:06:43.782 --> 01:06:45.871
Here he comes. now get it toget.

1380
01:06:46.045 --> 01:06:48.613
And look
how happy he is to see you.

1381
01:06:48.787 --> 01:06:50.093
I told you!

1382
01:06:50.267 --> 01:06:52.486
-Hey. Zoey.
-Hi!

1383
01:06:52.878 --> 01:06:54.967
Hey. I remember you.

1384
01:06:55.489 --> 01:06:56.751
You do. really?

1385
01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:59.276
Of course. Shay. right?

1386
01:06:59.841 --> 01:07:00.842
Right.

1387
01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:02.888
So Jesse.
what's the plan?

1388
01:07:03.062 --> 01:07:04.672
Well. I was thinking

1389
01:07:04.846 --> 01:07:06.544
if we combine your insanely
tasty barbecue sauce

1390
01:07:06.718 --> 01:07:08.111
and my social media accounts

1391
01:07:08.285 --> 01:07:10.287
we can have this
wrapped up in no time.

1392
01:07:11.897 --> 01:07:12.854
Check it out.

1393
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.509
Oh. wow. 4.500 followers.

1394
01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:17.250
Nice job. Mr. Influencer.

1395
01:07:17.424 --> 01:07:18.730
[chuckles] Foodies and actors.

1396
01:07:18.904 --> 01:07:20.906
There's thousands
of them in the city.

1397
01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.386
How do we tap into them?

1398
01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.041
Well. I'm good
with social media.

1399
01:07:25.345 --> 01:07:28.131
I'll create posts and set
up auto responders for sharing.

1400
01:07:28.305 --> 01:07:29.828
Zoey. you did not
tell me

1401
01:07:30.002 --> 01:07:32.352
you were bringing
an IT expert to this meeting.

1402
01:07:32.961 --> 01:07:34.572
Shall we get started?

1403
01:07:34.746 --> 01:07:37.140
Sure. yeah.
I'll text you my account info.

1404
01:07:37.705 --> 01:07:40.273
Actually. what's your number?

1405
01:07:41.492 --> 01:07:43.146
You know.
I've got recipes to write.

1406
01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.670
Why don't I let my
tech team solve the hard stuff?

1407
01:07:45.844 --> 01:07:47.324
All right.
Check you two later.

1408
01:07:47.498 --> 01:07:49.413
-Alright. See you.
-Bye.

1409
01:07:51.328 --> 01:07:52.546
So.

1410
01:07:53.808 --> 01:07:55.419
That's me.

1411
01:07:55.593 --> 01:07:57.464
Okay. so we should set up
a Grandpa's BBQ profile

1412
01:07:57.638 --> 01:07:59.553
for the competition
on all your accounts.

1413
01:07:59.727 --> 01:08:01.468
Okay.

1414
01:08:01.642 --> 01:08:03.383
Let's send a "follow us
on social. like us" request

1415
01:08:03.557 --> 01:08:05.516
to all of your followers and
maybe like a call to action.

1416
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:07.692
I could create
a discount coupon

1417
01:08:07.866 --> 01:08:10.173
for anyone that comes to vote f.

1418
01:08:10.347 --> 01:08:11.304
I love it.

1419
01:08:11.478 --> 01:08:13.089
What do you think of this?

1420
01:08:13.263 --> 01:08:19.225
Vote... hashtag VoteGrandpa.
hashtag BestBarbecue

1421
01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:23.011
or hashtag
GrandpaSaysVoteForMe.

1422
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:27.755
All of them.
How many of you done so far?

1423
01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:29.583
Uh...

1424
01:08:31.324 --> 01:08:33.457
Give it here.
Give it here.

1425
01:08:37.548 --> 01:08:39.419
[knock at door]

1426
01:08:39.811 --> 01:08:42.030
There you are.
You haven't been returning my c.

1427
01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:43.902
Where's the love?

1428
01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:45.991
Well. I've been busy at the
food truck competition.

1429
01:08:46.165 --> 01:08:47.297
It's been a lot of work.

1430
01:08:47.471 --> 01:08:48.863
Yeah.
you look tense man.

1431
01:08:49.037 --> 01:08:50.778
Hey. relax.
can I get your cappuccino?

1432
01:08:50.952 --> 01:08:54.695
No. I'm fine. thanks. So. how's
the Hawaiian sauce coming along?

1433
01:08:54.869 --> 01:08:56.436
We agreed it'd
be ready by now. right?

1434
01:08:56.610 --> 01:08:58.438
Yeah. That's
why I was calling you.

1435
01:08:58.612 --> 01:09:01.093
The sauce is great.
You're going to love it.

1436
01:09:01.267 --> 01:09:03.008
Great. Can I have a taste?

1437
01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:05.793
There's just one ingredient
we need to finalize.

1438
01:09:05.967 --> 01:09:07.969
Come on. Rick.
It's a simple question.

1439
01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.841
Is it ready or not?

1440
01:09:10.015 --> 01:09:11.625
You're not going to
believe how good this sauce is.

1441
01:09:11.799 --> 01:09:13.453
It's going to be a
gold mine for us.

1442
01:09:13.627 --> 01:09:15.977
Look. Rick. You said it was
going to be ready by now.

1443
01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:17.675
I put my trust in you.

1444
01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:21.679
Okay. you got 48 hours
to get the final sample ready.

1445
01:09:21.853 --> 01:09:23.724
You got it done.
No worries.

1446
01:09:23.898 --> 01:09:25.552
You sure you don't want
that cappuccino?

1447
01:09:25.726 --> 01:09:26.684
Another time. Rick.

1448
01:09:26.858 --> 01:09:28.468
-Donut
-[Colin] No.

1449
01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:33.256
[Bradley] Bradley speaking.

1450
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:34.692
Colin is really
laying on the pressure.

1451
01:09:34.866 --> 01:09:36.607
You need to get that sauce now.

1452
01:09:36.781 --> 01:09:38.957
[Bradley] Yes. sir. Whatever yo-

1453
01:09:41.394 --> 01:09:42.961
Mm.

1454
01:09:44.049 --> 01:09:45.093
Check this out.

1455
01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:47.444
I created an emoji of Grandpa

1456
01:09:47.618 --> 01:09:49.446
and I set it to some
simple animation.

1457
01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.361
[Jesse] [laughs] Genius.

1458
01:09:51.535 --> 01:09:53.624
We can totally plaster
all the accounts with this gif.

1459
01:09:53.798 --> 01:09:56.235
I think it's called a jiff.

1460
01:09:57.062 --> 01:10:00.283
Oh. man.
Gotta get to acting class.

1461
01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:01.849
Can we wrap this up later?

1462
01:10:02.023 --> 01:10:03.590
Yeah. Sure.

1463
01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:08.682
Would your boyfriend mind
if I called or texted you later?

1464
01:10:08.856 --> 01:10:12.208
Oh. no. No. he's cool.
He won't mind.

1465
01:10:12.991 --> 01:10:16.168
I'm just kidding.
There's there's no boyfriend.

1466
01:10:16.342 --> 01:10:17.778
Awesome.

1467
01:10:18.736 --> 01:10:21.129
I guess I'll talk to you later.

1468
01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:22.566
Sure.

1469
01:10:24.307 --> 01:10:25.743
Break a leg?

1470
01:10:26.047 --> 01:10:28.049

[Zoey] Oh. boy. That was really.

1484
01:11:11.223 --> 01:11:13.530
-Yeah. it was.
-[Zoey] We did good.

1485
01:11:13.704 --> 01:11:16.141
Oh even better.
We got 100 new followers.

1486
01:11:16.315 --> 01:11:18.274
Oh my goodness.

1487
01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:19.971
Hmm.

1488
01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:21.538
-[paper rustling]
-[Zoey] You outdid yourserlf.

1489
01:11:21.712 --> 01:11:24.976
Hey. wait a sec.
What's that noise?

1490
01:11:27.195 --> 01:11:28.719
Hey! Get out of there!

1491
01:11:28.893 --> 01:11:30.634
-[gasps]
-[glass shatters]

1492
01:11:37.423 --> 01:11:38.903
-Did you see that?
-Yeah.

1493
01:11:39.077 --> 01:11:40.905
Yhat guy's been
around my truck before

1494
01:11:41.079 --> 01:11:43.168
asking questions about my sauce.

1495
01:11:43.342 --> 01:11:44.996
He's from my old company.

1496
01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:47.955
I feel like there's definitely
something going on.

1497
01:11:48.129 --> 01:11:49.348
You think so?

1498
01:11:49.522 --> 01:11:51.394
What if
my old boss sent him?

1499
01:11:51.568 --> 01:11:53.221
I mean. I knew there were
rumors

1500
01:11:53.396 --> 01:11:55.833
but I didn't think Colin
would really let him get away

1501
01:11:56.007 --> 01:11:57.704
with stealing people's recipes.

1502
01:11:57.878 --> 01:12:00.620
I don't know. Colin seems
way above that kind of stuff.

1503
01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:03.319
It's just probably a
simple misunderstanding.

1504
01:12:03.971 --> 01:12:05.799
You're probably right.

1505
01:12:06.278 --> 01:12:07.932
[Zoey exhales sharply]

1506
01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:10.891
Either way.
I got your back.

1507
01:12:11.065 --> 01:12:12.937
Thanks. [laughs]

1508
01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:21.424
[D'Angelo] Mm.

1509
01:12:21.946 --> 01:12:23.339
Not bad.

1510
01:12:24.078 --> 01:12:25.863
Oh. that's all right. Mm.

1511
01:12:26.951 --> 01:12:28.169
Spicy.

1512
01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:34.785
Zo... I've had a blast

1513
01:12:34.959 --> 01:12:37.004
but I think I'm heading back
into retirement

1514
01:12:37.178 --> 01:12:39.398
with my teas
and my game shows.

1515
01:12:39.572 --> 01:12:41.313
Jesse. how would you feel

1516
01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:44.751
about sous-chefing on a more pet
basis if we win?

1517
01:12:44.925 --> 01:12:48.886
We do work well together
and it would be a crazy adventu.

1518
01:12:49.321 --> 01:12:51.628
You'd have to be cool
with me going off for auditions.

1519
01:12:51.802 --> 01:12:53.020
Okay by me.

1520
01:12:53.194 --> 01:12:54.500
Fine with me too.

1521
01:12:55.327 --> 01:12:57.068
Well. if we win
then let's give it a go.

1522
01:12:57.242 --> 01:12:59.375
Okay. That sounds good.
Let's do it.

1523
01:12:59.549 --> 01:13:01.028
Grandpa's BBQ.

1524
01:13:01.202 --> 01:13:02.378
[laughs]

1525
01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:04.815
[Maxine] Welcome to the finale..

1526
01:13:05.119 --> 01:13:07.295
Teams. you have been
cooking all day.

1527
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:09.646
And right now our
judges are enjoying

1528
01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.822
one last taste test before voti.

1529
01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:14.564
Do they love it?
Do they hate it?

1530
01:13:14.738 --> 01:13:17.175
We'll be tallying the results
from all of the challenges

1531
01:13:17.349 --> 01:13:20.570
because today is the
final judges vote judges.

1532
01:13:20.874 --> 01:13:23.399
Judges. how are you feeling rig?

1533
01:13:23.573 --> 01:13:26.010
Zoey and Grandpa's
barbecue sauce is my favorite.

1534
01:13:26.184 --> 01:13:28.316
I mean. I wish I
could have a double serving.

1535
01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:30.231
It just pairs
so perfectly with the meat.

1536
01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:35.672
Yeah. agreed. My barbecue sauces
have won a ton of awards.

1537
01:13:35.846 --> 01:13:38.544
I shouldn't admit this but
Zoey's is better.

1538
01:13:38.718 --> 01:13:40.372
-[chuckles]
-Oh. I think so too.

1539
01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:42.156
Maybe you should ask
her for the ingredients. Colin.

1540
01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:44.898
Yeah. I'd love to be
able to make it myself.

1541
01:13:45.072 --> 01:13:49.642
Well. don't forget about
Biker Bacon Love. Their wrapped.

1542
01:13:49.816 --> 01:13:51.296
They haven't made it easy on us.

1543
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:54.081
They have not. This is true.

1544
01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.694
Done.

Thank you.

1714
01:23:07.721 --> 01:23:09.680
I'll leave you two to talk.

1715
01:23:11.769 --> 01:23:14.380
Jesse told me
this was a catering job.

1716
01:23:14.554 --> 01:23:16.165
I'm sorry.
I tricked you.

1717
01:23:16.339 --> 01:23:19.211
I thought maybe you
wouldn't come otherwise.

1718
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:22.084
Colin. I really--

1719
01:23:22.258 --> 01:23:25.130
Zoey. I just have a few things
I want to say first.

1720
01:23:25.913 --> 01:23:27.567
You were right.

1721
01:23:27.741 --> 01:23:29.874
Rick was trying to get
your sauce ingredients to repli.

1722
01:23:30.048 --> 01:23:32.790
And I honestly had no idea.

1723
01:23:33.617 --> 01:23:35.532
I know Rick
is a little rough around the ed.

1724
01:23:35.706 --> 01:23:37.925
but didn't
I think stealing was his style.

1725
01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:41.277
I honestly thought
we we're making Hawaiian sauce.

1726
01:23:43.322 --> 01:23:46.325
And this whole experience. it's.

1727
01:23:46.499 --> 01:23:49.589
it's made me realize
this business is not for me.

1728
01:23:50.112 --> 01:23:53.506
So I decided to step
down as CEO at the end of month.

1729
01:23:53.898 --> 01:23:55.769
But you love BBQ Bill's.

1730
01:23:55.943 --> 01:23:57.684
I did.

1731
01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:02.341
But meeting you made me realize
I'm not being true to myself.

1732
01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:07.129
And I'm so sorry for what
Rick did to you.

1733
01:24:07.303 --> 01:24:08.956
I apologize.

1734
01:24:11.307 --> 01:24:13.178
And I let him go.

1735
01:24:13.352 --> 01:24:14.266
Wow.

1736
01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:15.702
-You fired Rick.
-Uh huh.

1737
01:24:15.876 --> 01:24:17.748
How did that go?

1738
01:24:17.922 --> 01:24:20.142
Um... not so great.

1739
01:24:20.316 --> 01:24:22.274
Not surprisingly. but...

1740
01:24:22.448 --> 01:24:23.493
it was the right thing
to do.

1741
01:24:23.667 --> 01:24:25.495
And more importantly

1742
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:29.716
my last act as a CEO
was to sign off on a healthier .

1743
01:24:30.195 --> 01:24:33.764
Inspired by pretty much
everything you recommended

1744
01:24:33.938 --> 01:24:35.635
in your pitch.

1745
01:24:35.809 --> 01:24:39.204
I think that's amazing.
You're going to change this cit.

1746
01:24:40.684 --> 01:24:44.296
Zoey. will you...
please forgive me?

1747
01:24:44.731 --> 01:24:46.342
Of course. I forgive you.

1748
01:24:46.516 --> 01:24:49.519
And there are a few things.
I'd like to say too.

1749
01:24:51.521 --> 01:24:53.697
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

1750
01:24:53.871 --> 01:24:58.397
I told you that I trusted you.
but I didn't. Not really.

1751
01:24:58.789 --> 01:25:01.835
The competition was a
fresh start for me when I lost b

1752
01:25:02.009 --> 01:25:04.838
and I jumped to conclusions abou
stealing my sauce

1753
01:25:05.012 --> 01:25:09.365
because I was afraid that I woud
lose everything all over again.

1754
01:25:10.279 --> 01:25:11.845
I'm sorry.

1755
01:25:13.543 --> 01:25:15.806
You put the
fun back in everything for me.

1756
01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:19.984
Like when we were in the truck.
just making some food together.

1757
01:25:20.158 --> 01:25:22.117
it was just... I felt so alive.

1758
01:25:22.595 --> 01:25:24.858
It's great
to have you by my side.

1759
01:25:25.032 --> 01:25:26.730
We make great partners.

1760
01:25:27.818 --> 01:25:29.602
And I was thinking we could...

1761
01:25:29.907 --> 01:25:32.344
bring someone
else back in the fold. hm?

1762
01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:35.086
