such a pleasure and kind of
feeling myself being erased...

and kind of going...

140
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.387
[sighs] It was that push and
pull that I found so erotic.

141

we marry eroticism

to play enough culturally

145
00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:57.607

It's a little--I'm fine.

175
00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:04.090
Just a burning-toast smell.

176
00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:06.259
- If you legitimately smell
burnt toast.

177
00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:07.677
that's cause for concern.

178
00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.095
- Casey. Casey. I'm fine.

179
00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.056
I just think someone outside
maybe is making toast.

180
00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.266
maybe a friendly neighbor. and
it's just wafting through the--

181
00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.769
- Oh. my God. W-W--Oh. my God.
- Oh. boy. Oh. boy.

182
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.354
- Maybe we should call
an ambulance.

183
00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.022
- John. Oh. my God. we can't
continue the discussion.

184
00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.398
Oh. my God. John.

185
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.941
- Does this happen
to him often?

186
00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.485
- I finished the book.
- John. John.

187
00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.778
- I finished the book.
- He finished it.

188
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:25.945
He really finished it.

189
00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.822
- Babe. did you call 911?
- Yeah.

190
00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.658
- Are you proud?
I finished "Clancy's Reward."

191
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.202
- You should definitely call
an ambulance.

192
00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:34.329
I'm so sorry to have to end
the discussion early.

193
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.247
[whispering] Thank you.
- [whispering] You're welcome.

194
00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.917
- We can't continue.
- We came prepared.

<i>[upbeat music]</i>

196
00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:47.342
- Welcome back
to "Point of Vieira."

197
00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:48.927
I'm Meredith Vieira.

198
00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.929
Let's get back
to our exclusive interview

199
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.807
with Kate Berlant
and John Early.

200
00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:57.102
How does it feel
to be sitting here together

201
00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.937
after so many years?

202
00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.230
- I needed this.

203
00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:02.065
I think I'm actually now
really looking around--

204
00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:03.775
- Cathartic.
- It's really cathartic.

205
00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:06.194
- Yeah.
- I'm getting a little dizzy.

206
00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:07.195
- Oh. jeez.
- Oh.

207
00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.279
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

208
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.864
- I'm gonna move through it.
- Okay.

209
00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:12.200
- But I'm getting
a little dizzy.

210
00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:15.161
- For you. John. same feelings?
- [squeals] Uh...

211
00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.080
- I'm sorry.
- I feel really good.

212
00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.457
- We can't hear you. sweetie.
- I feel good.

213
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.043
- You look--I'm looking at you.

214
00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.796
It's so strange 'cause you look
12. but you also look 60.

215
00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.841
And I love the shading.

216
00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.801
and you finally found
a foundation that matches.

217
00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.136
- You know. it's so funny.

218
00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.971
Obviously. I haven't seen you
in years.

219
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.848
- Yeah. I know. years. years.

220
00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.641
- You know. I haven't seen you
in person.

221
00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:39.352
Um...I haven't seen you
in person.

222
00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:41.980
but I also haven't seen you
just kind of reflected

223
00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:43.815
anywhere in the culture.
so what have you been up to?

224
00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:45.817
- I've been really good.
I've been busy.

225
00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.402
I've been in New York
doing theater.

226
00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:48.778
- Aw!

227
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.613
- It's just kind of
the first love of mine.

228
00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:52.949
But. mostly. I'm busy
with my foundations.

229
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.451
That is really
what keeps me occupied.

230
00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:55.660
- You have foundations?
- Yeah.

231
00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.037
I've started many foundations.

232
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.705
And that's where I really pour
my energy now.

233
00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.248
- What foundations?
- My foundations.

234
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.458
- Which ones?

235
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.667
- A lot of work.
but it's so worth it.

236
00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:03.835
Hmm?
- Which foundations?

237
00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.504
- Which foundation?
- Name one.

238
00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:07.881
- Which foundation
would I name?

239
00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.591
Do you see?
- One of them. yeah.

240
00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:10.717
- Which foundation. you know.

241
00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:11.801
and if you come down
to the office--

242
00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:13.178
- It's almost Irish.
Which foundation?

243
00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.846
- I didn't go Irish
at all with that.

244
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.556
I didn't go Irish
when I said foundation.

245
00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.767
- Now she's fully Irish. so...

246
00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.226
- You. mister.

247
00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.145
I can't go anywhere
without seeing your face.

248
00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.438
- [laughs] I know.

249
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.315
- I saw you in the movie
where you play the genie.

250
00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:26.733
- Oh. yeah.

251
00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.318
- I walked in on
my friend's dog watching it.

252
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.779
The dog was completely
fixated on you.

253
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.155
That must have
been hard. though.

254
00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:34.449
I know you got a lot of flak
for playing the genie.

255
00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:36.368
People are so vicious now.

256
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.787
- Oh. my God. I should've
congratulated you on the kiosk.

257
00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.372
- What kiosk?
- Should've led with that.

258
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.082
Yes. congrats on the kiosk.

259
00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:44.125
Um. Kate has been selling
candies...

260
00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.877
- Oh. my gosh.
- At the airport.

261
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.046
This little kiosk at
the airport with your candies.

262
00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.381
- No. I don't sell candy
at the airport.

263
00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:52.092
- Pralines and nut clusters
and toffees...

264
00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.968
- I don't sell pralines.
- And little whoopsie daisies.

265
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.303
Yeah.
- I don't sell candy

266
00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.681
at the airport.
- It's just not what I heard.

267
00:09:57.722 --> 00:09:59.724
- I don't think anyone's
ever told you I do that.

268
00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.267
I can't believe
I'm saying that.

269
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:03.144
- Kate. I'm not attacking you.
It is just not what I heard.

270
00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.354
- Well. I don't have a kiosk
at the airport.

271
00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:05.772
- Mutual friends
have reported that you have

272
00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.691
a kiosk at the airport
where you sell candy.

273
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.067
- I do not sell candy
at the airport.

274
00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.568
and no mutual friends
have reported that

275
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.903
'cause that would be a lie.

276
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.906
- Sorry. is it cold in here?
- I don't think so.

277
00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.408
- Yeah. I just feel
a little cold.

- I feel good.
I feel really good.

284
00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.422
- Didn't I tell you
the first month

285
00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.007
is a little tough with nausea?

286
00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.800
But then you just overcome that
hump. and it feels so good.

287
00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.301
- Yeah. my receptors
were completely gnarled.

288
00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.178
- Yeah. Are you sleeping well?
- Like a rock.

289
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.097
- Right?
My head hits the pillow now--

290
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.765
I'm out immediately.
two minutes max.

291
00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.767
- Yeah. buddy. I'm the same.

292
00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.686
I'm the same thing.
- Yeah.

293
00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.104
No. you seem
to have really leveled out.

294
00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:47.647
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's really cool to see.

295
00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.065
Yeah. yeah.
I told you we're doing.

296
00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:50.483
like. a lot
of home-renovation stuff.

297
00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:51.860
- We're actually doing
some renovations. too.

298
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.278
- Oh. no way.

299
00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.405
- Yeah. a buddy of mine's
helping me out with some...

300
00:10:55.447 --> 00:10:58.074
You know that wall between
the living room and the garage?

301
00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.909
- Yes.
- We had that knocked down.

302
00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.746
- Oh. so the garage is exposed
to the living room?

303
00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.330
- Totally exposed.
- Oh. no way. No way.

304
00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.833
You know that wall
that separates the bedroom

305
00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.501
from the bathroom.
like. the main--

306
00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:10.211
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.
- We knocked that down.

307
00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.755
- Oh. amazing.
- Yeah. yeah.

308
00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.590
- You know. my daughter's room
at the top of the upstairs?

309
00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:14.841
- Oh. yeah. for sure.

310
00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.176
- There's that utility room
next to it

311
00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:17.677
with the boiler.
hot water heater.

312
00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.137
Yeah. we had
that wall knocked down.

313
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.430
- Okay.
- So now the boiler is kind of

314
00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:22.974
in the room with my daughter
as she sleeps.

315
00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.809
- The renovation stuff is.
like. you have to.

316
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.311
Hi.
- I don't want to interrupt.

317
00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:29.522
but a check for you.
- No interruption.

318
00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:31.775
No. absolutely not.
- No. no. no. let me get this.

319
00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.485
- No.
- Do not listen to this guy.

320
00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.070
Don't take his money.

321
00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.238
- Oh. do you take hot caramel?
- Of course. yeah. Of course.

322
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.366
- Very cool. Thank you.
- He insisted.

323
00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.409
- I surrender. [laughs]
- I insist.

324
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.162
She's gorgeous.
- Yeah. she's beautiful.

325
00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.413
- Yeah. you know

326
00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.624
that row of homes
right across from our place?

327
00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.167
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:50.669
- Yeah. we went ahead. had
all those homes knocked down.

329
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.253
- Oh. wow.
- Yeah.

330
00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:53.838
So when Kara's cooking
in the kitchen. she looks out.

331
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.006
and it's totally open.

332
00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.966
- That's amazing.
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

333
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:59.094
- Well. I would love
to bring Sasha over there

334
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.720
and see how you guys
opened the space.

335
00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.597
And I know Sasha would love
to see Kara.

336
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.140
- Kara would love
to see Sasha.

337
00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:05.100
- Yeah.

338
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.940
[device beeps]

339
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.401

food. technically.

Yeah. it's my trip.

341
00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:36.047
She was really nice.

342
00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.260
Did you valet?
- Yeah.

343
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.553

346
00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:55.900
- Oh. my God.
It's not gonna fit.

347
00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:59.112
- Give me a second before you
make these bold declarations.

348
00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:00.488
- No time is gonna
make that fit.

349
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.323
- Had I put this
in the checked bag.

350
00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:05.326
we would've gotten a fee.
an exorbitant fee.

351
00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:06.953
You know what?
I'm just gonna hang on to it.

352
00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.621
read on the plane--
it'll be fine.

353
00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:10.123
- You are not gonna read
that thing.

354
00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:11.583
- Yes. I am gonna read it.

355
00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:14.044
- This line is not moving.
We are at standstill.

356
00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:15.253
- Oh. God.

357
00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.881

I get on the plane.

How would you like to breeze

361
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.220
through the security line
today. huh?

362
00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:25.430
- What is does that mean?

363
00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:27.223

- Breezer. what is that?
What is Breezer?

365
00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.728
- It's a VIP experience
at the airport.

366
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.980
Could have you at your gate
within five minutes. huh?

367
00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:35.648
- F-five minutes?

368
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.650

Damn. boy. you're strong. huh?

[laughs]
Congratulations.

370
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:41.613
- Ask how much. Ask how much.
- How much is it?

371
00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.656
- You don't need to worry
about that.

372
00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.408
You won't even be charged
for the first month.

373
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.203
and you could cancel anytime.
- Well. that seems low risk.

374
00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:49.412
- Yeah.
- That seems low risk.

375
00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.289
- Sorry. are you
with the airport. again?

376
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.667

- Let's go. Blake.
Off your phone. buddy.

378
00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:57.420

Do you have Blake's. too?
- Yeah. Here you are.

384
00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:12.560
- Now I just need you to look
at this red dot here.

385
00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:13.853

No. I-I didn't like that.

392
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.952
Oh. should it sting?
There's a stinging.

393
00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.537
- Ah. it's in your mind.

394
00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.372
- Oh. and you are not gonna
want to hear this.

395
00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:33.707
but if we go to Disneyland.

396
00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.125
we're stopping
to visit my sister.

397
00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.835
- Oh. Anaheim.

398
00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.170
- She just got through chemo.
I haven't even called her.

399
00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.047
- [laughs] That's hilarious.

400
00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.841
- [scoffs]
You're not listening.

401
00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:46.052
- Congratulations. folks.
Welcome to the Breezer family.

402
00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:47.971
- Oh.
- Thank you so much. Frankie.

403
00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:49.264
- No problem. baby.

404
00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.182
Just head over to that sign
that says Breezer

405
00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:54.561
and breeze on through.
- Okay. Okay.

406
00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:57.439
- It's just $240.
That's half off the first year.

407
00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.982
If we want to buy back
a retina scan.

408
00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:00.358
it just takes 90 days.

409
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.818
and all we have to do
is appear in court.

410
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.655
- Oh. I'm sorry. $240?
- I'm hearing myself.

411
00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:07.741
- I feel violated.
- We've been scammed.

412
00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.201
- It's the naturalization
of these daily indignities.

413
00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:11.536
Next thing you know.

414
00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:13.663
your auto-enlisted
in the goddamn military.

415
00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.582

Blake. get off your phone.

416
00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.375
- Oh. well. at least
we're gonna get through.

417
00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.711

Frankie?

418
00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:22.255
- David.
- Oh.

419
00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:25.258

And oh. it's Blake.

Kayla. it's Blake.
- Hi. Kayla. Hi. Katie.

422

- So this is crazy.
- I know.

423
00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:35.643
- Where are you guys going?
- Los Angeles.

424
00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.687
- No. that's where we're going.
- [gasps] Stop.

425
00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:40.607
- For two weeks.
- We're going just for 10 days.

426
00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.275

- Where are you staying?

429
00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.448
- At this place that was
highly recommended...

430
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.492
- For ease. yeah.
- Yeah.

431
00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.952
- Fun. fun. fun. So amazing.
- That's great.

432
00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.371
- How about you guys?

433
00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.247
- We got a little place out
in Malibu.

434
00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:57.874
- Oh. wow.

435
00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.668
- You know. we tried
to get off the beaten path.

436
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.629
- We're going on a hike
out by the Hollywood sign.

437
00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.464
- Yeah. see the Hollywood sign.

438
00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.007
- Always wanted
to get that shot.

439
00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:08.093
- I heard
you can't get up there.

440
00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:10.011
You can't.
- There's no access.

441
00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:13.348
- No. there is. though.
- No. no. no. No. you can't.

442
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.974
You cannot hike
to the Hollywood sign.

443
00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:16.393
100% you cannot hike
to the Hollywood sign.

444
00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:17.602
- No one can.

445
00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:19.354
- Well. tell that
to our travel agent.

446
00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:20.480
- There's a whole thing--

447
00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:21.648
someone hung themselves
up there.

448
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:24.442
- Oh. God.
That's so horrible--suicide.

449
00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.236
- Oh. no.
- Jesus.

450
00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.321
- Oh. Sorry.

451
00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:29.989
- Are you--
you're reading that book?

452
00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.449
That's a client of mine.

453
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.702
I know him.
- He's a client?

454
00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.620
- Yeah. he's fantastic.
- Paul Floor is a client?

455
00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:37.205
- Crazy but fantastic.
- Wow.

456
00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:38.998
- Yeah.
No. I'm loving it so far.

457
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.584
I'm loving it so far.

458
00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:44.337
- And. Blake. how are you.
Mr. Man?

459
00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:46.006
- Fine.
- Oh. well. you--

460
00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.132
both: Oh.

461
00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:48.883
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

462
00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.593
It's so good to see you.

463
00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.554
I have to say. we're a little
anxious to get to the plane.

464
00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:54.305
although we're part
of this new--

465
00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:55.473
Do you know Breezer?

466
00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.892
It's kind of
a concierge VIP service.

467
00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.978
It kind of gets you---
- Exclusive service.

468
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.771
- Yeah. you can bypass
the whole line and get there.

469
00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.857
- It's in the name--Breezer.
- It's not cheap.

470
00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.775
But it's worth
kind of the peace of mind.

471
00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:07.027
- We love it.

472
00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:08.862
- You've not read the article
about Breezer?

473
00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.989
- You didn't give them
your credit card. did you?

474
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.615
- Y-yeah.
- Whoa.

475
00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.075
- Oh.

476
00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:16.327
Yeah. you're gonna probably
have your identity stolen.

477
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.121
- You're kidding.

478
00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:20.248
- No. no. no. you do not want
to get involved with them.

479
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.000
They're gonna take
all of your information.

480
00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:23.251
Did they do the eye scan?

481
00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:24.794
- Yeah.
- Yeah. it's out there.

482
00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:28.673
- You can buy back your retina.
oh. so don't worry.

483
00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.633
- Folks. folks.
I can take anyone

484
00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:33.553
who's in first class
to our expedited line.

485
00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:35.180
- Oh. my God. it's us.
- Guilty.

486
00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.389
- Anyone in first class.

487
00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:38.141
- It was so fun
running into you.

488
00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.476
I love your top.
It's so cute.

489
00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.561
- We'll see you on
the Walk of Fame. huh. buddy?

490
00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:43.271
- Okay. cool.
- Bye. Bye.

491
00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.523
- It is good to see you.
- You look amazing.

492
00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:46.941
Have you been
doing something?

493
00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.069
- No. but you look great. too.
- Okay. Love you.

494
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.820
- Bye. Love you. too.

495
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.907
What was that?
- I know.

496
00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:55.867
- What the hell was that?
- It's a hustle.

497
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:57.452
I do not like the way
he talks to you.

498
00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:58.995
I shut down. did you feel that?
- I did.

499
00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.706
- I really felt myself
powering down.

500
00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:02.791
- You were gone.

501
00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.167
- I don't have
the energy anymore.

502
00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:05.877
Maybe three years ago.
you know. when the boys

503
00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.629
were really small.
I had the energy.

504
00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:10.090
But now. I've grown past it

505
00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.676
and I can't do it anymore.

506
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:16.554
- That'll be--Oh. oh. oh.
I see right through you.

507
00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.306
- First class.
well. that'll be us.

508
00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:20.725
So crass.
- We know you're first class.

509
00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.227
It's right there
in the clothes.

510
00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.938
- I can see by the rose gold
on your iPhone case. bitch.

511
00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:26.314
- Thank you. By the way.

512
00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:29.025
the baggier the clothes.
the bigger bank account is--

513
00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:31.027
- Oh. we have to get you
a new one of those.

514
00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:33.571
- We have to find--
'cause this. it should stick.

515
00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:34.948
- Mom. Dad. our flight.

516
00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:37.033
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.
should we breeze on through?

517
00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:38.827
Let's go. Let's go.

518
00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:41.162
- I'm getting a new suitcase.
- Wipe the slate clean.

519
00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:43.039
Oh. you know what?

520
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:45.417
This is above five ounces.
I've got to chug this.

521
00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:50.422
- I'm having a residual sort of
dull pain from the retina scan.

522
00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.841
[voice muffles]
It's a dull present pain.

525
00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:10.108
- You both are married?
both: Yes. yes.

526
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.694
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

527
00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:15.697
- Very happily so. Very happy.
- So happy. So happy.

528
00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.198
- How is Mark. by the way?
- Mark's so good.

529
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.491
He says hi.
He sends his love.

530
00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:19.826
- Well. send it
right back to him.

531
00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:21.745
- How's Keith?
- Keith is great.

532
00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.455
Keith is great.
We're great.

533
00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.833
- He's been good?
- He has been good.

534
00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:29.210
I've really lost track
of the breakthroughs.

535
00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:31.713
- Mark and I pull back a layer.
there's another layer.

536
00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:33.340
Pull back a curtain.
there's another curtain.

537
00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:35.842
It's constantly unfolding.
It's almost like an onion.

538
00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:37.302
I don't think anyone's
ever talked about that.

539
00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:39.512
The layers of an onion
and the way you peel it back

540
00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:40.847
and there are more layers.

541
00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:43.850
- We have a marriage
that just keeps evolving.

542
00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:45.685
- Mark and I don't separate.
We follow each other.

543
00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:46.895
We share one towel.

544
00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.730
You know. we're really
committed

545
00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:50.732
to no barriers between us.
- That's disgusting.

546
00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.068
- We don't go anywhere
without the other person.

547
00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:54.986
- The emotional breakthroughs.
the physical breakthroughs.

548
00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:57.739
if I can. if I can go there.
- Please go there.

549
00:19:57.781 --> 00:20:01.076
- No. physical sexual
chemistry--white hot.

550
00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:03.912
We just...
- We are like two teenagers.

just kind of skin against skin.
just kind of--

552
00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:10.377
- No. when skin hits skin...
- Yeah. yeah.

553
00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:13.296
- Over years. yeah.
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

554
00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:15.465
No. I. uh...

555
00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:16.633
Yeah.

556
00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:18.343
- Mer. the sex is good.

557
00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:20.387
- I think maybe we'll get off
that topic. I think that--

558
00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:21.971
- Mark can work the middle.

559
00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:25.433
- We should really switch gears
once again.

560
00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:27.435
- [blubbers]
Shake that off.

561
00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:29.521
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.
- Yeah.

562
00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.022
- Let's talk
about something positive.

563

You both are married. both
happily married and children--

564
00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.402
how many kids do you all have?
- I have a couple.

565
00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:36.736
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

566
00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:38.238
- I've got a four.
I know how many kids I have.

567
00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.489
I have four. yeah.

568
00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:41.241
- Do you know the names
of your children?

569
00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:42.742
- Yeah.

570
00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:44.911
- Go. name them.
- Huh? Say?

571
00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:47.414
- Say the names of your kids.

572
00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:48.998
- I will.

573
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:51.501
Sasha.

574
00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:54.421
- Oh. that's beautiful.
- Marsha.

575
00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:56.172
- Two more. honey.

576
00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:57.590
- I'm almost there.

577
00:20:57.632 --> 00:21:01.011
- Manda.
- Last one.

578
00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:02.345
- Charlie.

579
00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:04.264
And they're all different
heights. which is so fun.

580
00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:05.473
- Really. still?

581
00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:06.933
- They're
all different heights.

582
00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:09.269
- Yeah. And which ones
were IVF? Which ones...

583
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.770
- How are your girls?

584
00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:12.689
I know that you board them
upstate and rarely see them.

585
00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:14.024
- They go to a school

586
00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:15.692
that's amazing.
and it's on a farm.

587
00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:18.111
And the kids really. you know.
work with produce.

588
00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:20.780
- It's for kids with extreme
behavioral issues--

589
00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:24.409
biting. snatching. stealing.

590
00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:26.786
pushing. scratching.

591
00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:29.205
You had those scratches.
I remember that.

One. two. three. four.

[music stops]

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:10.872
- What's up?
- What?

607
00:22:10.914 --> 00:22:12.165
- I want to take this
from the top. guys.

608
00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:14.167
- Okay. cool. From the top.
- Okay.

609
00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:17.295

Your top. just your top.

Okay.

And stop.
- What?

613
00:22:25.929 --> 00:22:27.597
- Just say it. What?
- Yeah. we can take it.

614
00:22:27.639 --> 00:22:28.765
- Yeah.
- I'm just trying to think

615
00:22:28.807 --> 00:22:30.892
of terms that'll stick.
you know.

616
00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:31.935
both: Wow.
- Okay.

617
00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:33.770
- No. no. it's not bad.

618
00:22:33.812 --> 00:22:35.605
It's just not
what we rehearsed.

619
00:22:35.647 --> 00:22:37.107
- Got it. No. point taken.
- Yeah.

620
00:22:37.148 --> 00:22:39.067
- You're making
your point so clear.

621
00:22:39.109 --> 00:22:40.902
Good job. Good job for making
a point so clear.

622
00:22:40.944 --> 00:22:43.196
- Okay. let's concentrate
on the movement.

623
00:22:43.238 --> 00:22:45.198
- Yeah. I would love to focus
on the movement.

624
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.908
That's what I came here to do--
focus on the movement.

625
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.284
- Great.
- Here to dance.

626
00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:50.495
- Just distribute the weight
evenly on your feet.

627
00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:52.789
Very top.
One. two...

628
00:22:52.831 --> 00:22:54.582
- We know.
you know what I mean?

629
00:22:54.624 --> 00:22:57.002
- Okay. let's just take a beat.
because I don't think anything

630
00:22:57.043 --> 00:22:58.753
I say is gonna get through
right now.

631
00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:02.424
So. everyone.
water and snack break.

632
00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:04.259
- Okay. wait. wait. wait.

633
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.011
I don't want to take a water
and snack break.

634
00:23:06.052 --> 00:23:08.805
I want to work.
- Back in line. Back in line.

635
00:23:08.847 --> 00:23:11.307
- Honestly. I think
this is just a matter

636
00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:12.475
of not enough rehearsal.

637
00:23:12.517 --> 00:23:13.852
- Try to talk to me

638
00:23:13.893 --> 00:23:16.187
in a way that actually
allows me to learn

639
00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:18.148
because I feel completely
dragged through the mud.

640
00:23:18.189 --> 00:23:20.275
I feel completely
alone up here.

641
00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:21.401
My hands are tied.

642
00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:22.986
and I can't dance
if my hands are tied.

643
00:23:23.028 --> 00:23:24.195
- This is not
what's going on here.

644
00:23:24.237 --> 00:23:25.905
- Then that's gaslighting!
- Yeah.

645
00:23:25.947 --> 00:23:27.907
- That's gaslighting. mama!
Okay?

646
00:23:27.949 --> 00:23:30.035
If you're denying our reality.

647
00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:31.661
if you're saying
that what's happening to us.

648
00:23:31.703 --> 00:23:33.204
our lived experience
isn't real.

649
00:23:33.246 --> 00:23:34.539
that's textbook gaslighting.
- It actually is.

650
00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:36.750
- Okay. because what I see.
my lived experience

651
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:38.501
is that Riley--Sorry. Riley.
but you're asleep at the wheel.

652
00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:39.878
- Asleep.
- Me?

653
00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.171
- Yeah. Riley. you.
- Yeah.

654
00:23:41.212 --> 00:23:43.214
- Sloan has her hand up.
Sloan.

655
00:23:43.256 --> 00:23:44.924
- I think you guys
are really good.

656
00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:46.676
but you just get
in your head maybe.

657
00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:48.178
both: Sloan.

658
00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:50.180
- I'm just really glad
that your mom's at jury duty

659
00:23:50.221 --> 00:23:52.974
and isn't here
to see this today. bitch.

660
00:23:53.016 --> 00:23:54.517
- Maybe we should take a break.

661
00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:57.520
- It might be good for us
to blow off some steam and--

662
00:23:57.562 --> 00:23:58.980
- Oh. pick me. pick me.

663
00:23:59.022 --> 00:24:01.316
Shut the fuck up. Cha Cha.

664
00:24:01.358 --> 00:24:03.693
- Girls...

665
00:24:03.735 --> 00:24:05.945
this is not
a big adjustment.

666
00:24:05.987 --> 00:24:08.740
And why am I hard on you?
Because you're good.

667
00:24:08.782 --> 00:24:10.367
Because you're good.

668
00:24:10.408 --> 00:24:12.577
You're better than this.
both: Yeah.

669
00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:14.037
- Okay?
- I know that we have it.

670
00:24:14.079 --> 00:24:16.039
I think we're under. like.
a lot of stress.

671
00:24:16.081 --> 00:24:17.499
- Let's actually go now.
Let's actually go.

672
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.875
Let's go now.
- It's actually good to go now.

673
00:24:18.917 --> 00:24:20.835
I'm ready now.
- Yes. snap to two.

674
00:24:20.877 --> 00:24:24.005
- Snap to two.

00:31:37.981 --> 00:31:40.108
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
- And what did you get?

846
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:41.735
- John got this.
- Oh.

847
00:31:41.776 --> 00:31:44.362
- Well. no. no. no. but she's
doing it.

848
00:31:44.404 --> 00:31:46.781
That's mine.

849
00:31:46.823 --> 00:31:50.035
That's mine.
You just did mine.

850
00:31:50.076 --> 00:31:51.578
And now we have it on record.

851
00:31:51.619 --> 00:31:53.204
So she's actually
crossed a boundary.

852
00:31:53.246 --> 00:31:54.497
You've crossed
a legal boundary.

853
00:31:54.539 --> 00:31:56.916
- John did--
- You crossed a legal boundary.

- Oh.

882
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:25.672
Okay. I guess
I misread the situation.

883
00:33:25.714 --> 00:33:27.674
- Literally what are you
talking about?

884
00:33:27.716 --> 00:33:31.511

always right in line. right?

Never crossing the line.
- Okay. Kate. I'm exhausted.

Drop the bit. This isn't funny.
[chuckles]

889

- It's not a bit.

890
00:33:42.272 --> 00:33:44.315
It's not funny
for the first time in my life

891
00:33:44.357 --> 00:33:46.067
I'm dead fucking serious.

892

- This is making me
really uncomfortable. Kate.

- Oh. my God. John.

894
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:57.412
I just want to fool around
a little bit. blow off steam.

895
00:33:57.454 --> 00:33:59.372
- Ew. I don't need
to blow off steam.

'Cause you seem
pretty tense. brother.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.676
- So no part of you
has ever touched a vagina?

- Jesus Christ.

we're all pink in the middle.

It's okay.

It's okay. You're fine.
- I have to make it up to you.

up to you. please. please.

a foot massage before. John.

- [chuckles]

923
00:35:03.436 --> 00:35:06.189
- I know
your back's killing you.

924
00:35:06.231 --> 00:35:08.149
- My doctor says everything
starts with the foot

925
00:35:08.191 --> 00:35:10.193
and then radiates up
to the back. yeah.

926
00:35:19.494 --> 00:35:20.787
Here?
- Yeah. that's good.

927
00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:22.872
- Okay.
- Give me that foot.

928
00:35:28.336 --> 00:35:30.547
- [exhales sharply]

- How so?

931
00:35:54.821 --> 00:35:56.823
- They carry us...

932
00:35:56.865 --> 00:35:59.534
our whole lives. every step.

933
00:35:59.576 --> 00:36:01.661

feeling the earth.

934

along this ridge.

935
00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.707

936
00:36:05.749 --> 00:36:08.626
from years of tap dancing
for executives.

937
00:36:08.668 --> 00:36:10.253
And. you know. all I have to do

938
00:36:10.295 --> 00:36:13.465
is drag my finger
three inches to the right.

939
00:36:13.506 --> 00:36:16.801
- [gasps] Fuck.

940
00:36:18.345 --> 00:36:20.597
- That skin is so sensitive.

941
00:36:20.638 --> 00:36:22.349
You're so receptive
to my touch.

942
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.225
You feel it everywhere.

- [moans]

944
00:36:27.771 --> 00:36:31.316
How can something so strong...

945
00:36:31.358 --> 00:36:33.485
be so sensitive?

946
00:36:33.526 --> 00:36:34.861
What would it take
for the thing

947
00:36:34.903 --> 00:36:38.698
that's carried weight
for so long...

948
00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.201
to finally let itself
be carried?

949
00:36:48.875 --> 00:36:52.045
- Oh. my God!
- Whoa. whoa. Where'd you go?

950
00:36:52.087 --> 00:36:54.047
- Don't look at my feet.
Don't touch my feet.

951
00:36:54.089 --> 00:36:56.383
Don't look at my feet.
They're hideous.

952
00:36:56.424 --> 00:36:58.968
- No. not on my watch.

953
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.888
You don't talk
about yourself like that. okay?

954
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.515
You're beautiful.
every part of you.

955
00:37:03.556 --> 00:37:05.642
- No. I'm not.

956

- [sighs]

957
00:37:12.524 --> 00:37:16.403
- God. I wish you could see
yourself the way I see you.

958
00:37:16.444 --> 00:37:17.904
- What do you see?

959
00:37:17.946 --> 00:37:20.490
- I see someone
who's been running

960
00:37:20.532 --> 00:37:22.492
for a really long time

961
00:37:22.534 --> 00:37:26.746
and is finally starting
to get a little tired.

962
00:37:26.788 --> 00:37:29.916
- I'm so tired.
- I know.

963
00:37:29.958 --> 00:37:32.711
- I'm so scared.
- I know. baby.

964
00:37:32.752 --> 00:37:34.587
What are you scared of?

965
00:37:34.629 --> 00:37:36.715
- I don't know.

966
00:37:36.756 --> 00:37:38.758
Being seen. I guess.

967
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.094
- And if I saw you.
what would I see?

968
00:37:41.136 --> 00:37:43.513
- Someone who doesn't see
themselves.

969
00:37:43.555 --> 00:37:46.349
- What don't you see?
- Myself.

970
00:37:46.391 --> 00:37:48.893
- Why don't you see yourself?
- Because I'm scared.

971
00:37:48.935 --> 00:37:51.062
- Of what?
- Of being seen. I guess.

972
00:37:51.104 --> 00:37:52.981
- Okay. so we're looping.
- Yeah. yeah. totally.

973
00:37:53.023 --> 00:37:54.691
- So I'm just gonna break us
out of this.

974
00:37:54.733 --> 00:37:56.026
- Yeah.

975
00:37:56.067 --> 00:37:59.612

that you are enough...

00:37:59.654 --> 00:38:01.865

977
00:38:04.868 --> 00:38:07.454

and I want you to tell yourself
that you're enough.

979
00:38:12.292 --> 00:38:14.836
- Sorry. so am I looking at you
or at myself because--

980
00:38:14.878 --> 00:38:17.422
- John. look in the mirror...
- Totally. totally.

1022
00:41:17.644 --> 00:41:19.688

<i>two-bedroom apartment--</i>

1023
00:41:19.729 --> 00:41:22.982
<i>the set of</i>
<i>"He's Gay. She's Half-Jewish."</i>

1024
00:41:23.024 --> 00:41:24.359
<i>Having not stepped foot</i>

1025
00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:26.736
<i>on the hallowed studio lot</i>
<i>in many years.</i>

1026
00:41:26.778 --> 00:41:29.155
<i>Kate Berland and John Early</i>
<i>warned me.</i>

1027
00:41:29.197 --> 00:41:32.575
<i>it was sure to be</i>
<i>an emotional afternoon.</i>

1028
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.745
- Kate. you're not
gonna believe this.

1029
00:41:35.787 --> 00:41:38.039
- Oh. my God.
- Still gets me.

1030
00:41:38.081 --> 00:41:39.833
[chuckles]
- Unbelievable.

1031
00:41:39.874 --> 00:41:42.585
Oh. my God.

1032
00:41:42.627 --> 00:41:44.379
- Kate. Kate. the couch.

1033
00:41:44.421 --> 00:41:46.881
- Bottoming?
Try bottomless...

1034
00:41:46.923 --> 00:41:48.216
mimosas that is.

1035
00:41:48.258 --> 00:41:49.718
There is no heartache

1036
00:41:49.759 --> 00:41:52.262
a boozy brunch with me tomorrow
can't remedy.

1037
00:41:52.303 --> 00:41:54.973
- Bloody Mary full of grace.

1038
00:41:55.015 --> 00:41:56.641
[both laughing]
- Oh. my God.

1039
00:41:56.683 --> 00:41:58.727
- You guys need to get this.
- So much happened here.

1040
00:41:58.768 --> 00:41:59.769
- This couch.

1041
00:41:59.811 --> 00:42:01.021
- I know I'm horny

1042
00:42:01.062 --> 00:42:04.441
because I just read this
as "bareback pecan."

1043
00:42:04.482 --> 00:42:06.109
- Do you remember
I tried to buy it?

1044
00:42:06.151 --> 00:42:07.694
- Yes. yes.
- They wouldn't give it to me.

1045
00:42:07.736 --> 00:42:10.071
And. actually. it was a bit
contentious with the producers.

1046
00:42:10.113 --> 00:42:11.865
So I said. "Well. I gave
my life to the show."

1047
00:42:11.906 --> 00:42:14.451
- [grunts]
- Oh. oh. John.

1048
00:42:14.492 --> 00:42:16.745
Oh. my God.
Sweetie. are you okay?

1049
00:42:16.786 --> 00:42:17.912
- What? From what?

1050
00:42:17.954 --> 00:42:20.749
- That looked
like a real tumble.

1051
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.834
- Tumbled?

1052
00:42:22.876 --> 00:42:25.420
- Are you okay?
- From what?

1053
00:42:25.462 --> 00:42:27.756
- From the fall.

1054
00:42:27.797 --> 00:42:29.716
- I didn't fall.
[chuckles]

1055
00:42:31.426 --> 00:42:33.678
Honey. I'm homo.

1056
00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.890
- Jake?
[sighs]

1057
00:42:36.931 --> 00:42:38.641
- I'm afraid to ask.

1058
00:42:38.683 --> 00:42:40.977
- I tried to decorate
my first Christmas tree.

1059
00:42:41.019 --> 00:42:43.229
and I guess my Jewish
half took over.

1060
00:42:45.065 --> 00:42:46.441
- You remember this spot.

1061
00:42:46.483 --> 00:42:49.486
John would always be--
I wonder if there's still...

1062
00:42:49.527 --> 00:42:53.073
Oh. this has to have
been there...

1063
00:42:53.114 --> 00:42:56.159
It's probably been there
for 15 years.

1064
00:42:56.201 --> 00:42:58.578
John always had his stash.
little bottles of gin.

1065
00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.788
hidden around the set.

1066
00:42:59.829 --> 00:43:01.623
Where else?
Now I'm on a--

1067
00:43:01.664 --> 00:43:03.291
Oh. I remember this.

1068
00:43:03.333 --> 00:43:05.960
This is one of my books here.

1069
00:43:06.002 --> 00:43:07.879
John. you're not gonna
believe this.

1070
00:43:07.921 --> 00:43:09.756
[laughs]

1071
00:43:09.798 --> 00:43:10.965
Still stashed all over the set.

1072
00:43:11.007 --> 00:43:12.509
I was actually impressed
by that.

1073
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.886
I used to always say that he's
tanked. the ratings haven't.

1074
00:43:14.928 --> 00:43:17.055
No. No. Oh!
- They did it.

1075
00:43:17.097 --> 00:43:18.640
Um. come in here.

1076
00:43:18.682 --> 00:43:21.142
Yeah. we were one of
the first multicamera--

1077
00:43:21.184 --> 00:43:22.227
- First show.
- First show?

1078
00:43:22.268 --> 00:43:23.645
- First show. period.

1079
00:43:23.687 --> 00:43:25.480
- We were the first
television shows in--

1080
00:43:25.522 --> 00:43:27.315
We were the first.
- Yeah.

1081
00:43:27.357 --> 00:43:29.651
- We were the first
television show in history

1082
00:43:29.693 --> 00:43:33.071
to show someone. uh.
actively taking a shit.

1083
00:43:34.114 --> 00:43:36.241
- [grunts]

1084
00:43:40.495 --> 00:43:42.163
I happen to hold
two world records.

1085
00:43:42.205 --> 00:43:45.083
I was also simultaneously
the first gay man

1086
00:43:45.125 --> 00:43:49.504
<i>in television history</i>
<i>to be seen taking a shit.</i>

1087
00:43:49.546 --> 00:43:51.756
- Penny!

1088
00:43:51.798 --> 00:43:53.591
It happened again!

1089
00:43:56.553 --> 00:43:58.179
<i>- People come up to me.</i>
<i>and they go.</i>

1090
00:43:58.221 --> 00:43:59.514
"Thank you for being
a woman on screen."

1091
00:43:59.556 --> 00:44:01.099
- And there's
so much shame--sorry.

1092
00:44:01.141 --> 00:44:03.268
- 'Cause kids watch the show.
and they go. "That's a woman."

1093
00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:06.521
- There's so much shame
that we have culturally

1094
00:44:06.563 --> 00:44:08.606
around these bodily functions.

1095
00:44:08.648 --> 00:44:10.692
- And I was one of the first
Jews to break into Hollywood.

1096
00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:12.193
It's a responsibility.

1097
00:44:12.235 --> 00:44:14.112
- You know. is it not just
another function of the body?

1098
00:44:14.154 --> 00:44:16.364
- It can be a lot
of responsibility.

1099
00:44:16.406 --> 00:44:19.367
- Is it no different than pee?

1100
00:44:19.409 --> 00:44:21.286
- I'm so moved.
- [snapping fingers]

1101
00:44:21.327 --> 00:44:23.621
- I'm so moved.

1102
00:44:23.663 --> 00:44:25.790
- Is it no different
than talking?

1103
00:44:25.832 --> 00:44:28.668
No. It's an opening
and closing of an orifice.

1104
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:30.670
It's the same as this.
- I love this painting.

1105
00:44:30.712 --> 00:44:32.172
- Hey. get--
you're gonna want to get...

1106
00:44:32.213 --> 00:44:33.548
- This is really--

1107
00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:36.301
- An answer to this.
because. oof. yeah. Grandma.

1108
00:44:36.343 --> 00:44:38.136
- I know. Grandma.

1109
00:44:38.178 --> 00:44:41.723
[sighs] Grandma.
I don't know what to do.

1110
00:44:41.765 --> 00:44:43.558
It's like
with each promotion I get.

1111
00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.977
I become more
and more undatable.

1112
00:44:46.019 --> 00:44:47.812
Will I ever find someone?

1113
00:44:47.854 --> 00:44:50.357
- You're a catch.
There are many eligible men

1114
00:44:50.398 --> 00:44:53.234
in this city who will celebrate
your success with you.

1115
00:44:53.276 --> 00:44:55.695
You just have to be patient.

1116
00:44:55.737 --> 00:44:58.073
- Thanks. Grandma.
- [belches]

1117
00:44:58.114 --> 00:44:59.783
- Grandma!

1118
00:44:59.824 --> 00:45:03.411
- Sorry. they serve seltzer
on tap in hell.

1119
00:45:05.747 --> 00:45:07.582
- The actress
who played my grandma...

1120
00:45:07.624 --> 00:45:10.251
- Dominique Reich.
- Dominique.

1121
00:45:10.293 --> 00:45:12.504
- It was such a loss
to the show. of course.

1122
00:45:12.545 --> 00:45:15.215
but also to
the comedy community at large

1123
00:45:15.256 --> 00:45:17.342
when she passed away.
especially for me.

1124
00:45:17.384 --> 00:45:19.427
You know. I was lucky enough
to have fostered

1125
00:45:19.469 --> 00:45:21.346
a real connection
with her on set.

1126
00:45:21.388 --> 00:45:24.766
- Meanwhile. I actually
fostered her daughter.

1127
00:45:24.808 --> 00:45:26.101
- When?

1128
00:45:26.142 --> 00:45:28.144
- After she passed.

1129
00:45:28.186 --> 00:45:30.939
- She left a lot
of her assets with me.

1130
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:33.233
Actually. I rent out
some of her properties

1131
00:45:33.274 --> 00:45:34.609
still to this day.

1132
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:37.278
- I remember I had to rent out
a dance space

1133
00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.114
just to work
through some of my grief

1134
00:45:39.155 --> 00:45:40.740
that wasn't verbal.

1135
00:45:40.782 --> 00:45:42.826
- Sorry. do you hear how just
with "fostered" and "rent out."

1136
00:45:42.867 --> 00:45:44.452
you're literally
just kind of free-associating

1137
00:45:44.494 --> 00:45:46.121
off the language
that I'm using.

1138
00:45:46.162 --> 00:45:47.455

I think self-care is the answer

- When we walk into a room.
there's a charge.

1176

acknowledge the work.

1177

it can't release.
it can't be defused.

00:48:07.637 --> 00:48:09.431
- If you're not gonna
literally say it...

1188
00:48:09.472 --> 00:48:10.682
both: Say it with the kitchen.

1189
00:48:10.724 --> 00:48:11.975
- Say it with the kitchen.

1190
00:48:12.017 --> 00:48:13.935
and then we know.
and then we can relax.

1191
00:48:13.977 --> 00:48:17.772
- The hostess was a sweetheart.
- The hostess knew.

1192
00:48:17.814 --> 00:48:19.357
- When we came in...
- She knew.

1193
00:48:19.399 --> 00:48:21.401
- Her knees almost buckled.
I sensed it.

1194
00:48:21.443 --> 00:48:22.777
- She was beside--

1195
00:48:22.819 --> 00:48:24.404
At least in the eyes.
she was beside herself.

1196
00:48:24.446 --> 00:48:26.031
- She was beside herself.

1197
00:48:26.072 --> 00:48:28.199
Yeah. she's so sweet.
Our waitress. though...

1198
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:30.952
- Our waitress--
something's off.

1199
00:48:30.994 --> 00:48:33.955
- She's frozen.
- She's frozen. Poor girl.

1200
00:48:33.997 --> 00:48:35.874
- What is she afraid of?
- Something's wrong.

1201
00:48:35.915 --> 00:48:39.711
I think maybe socially she's
a little behind her peer group.

1202
00:48:39.753 --> 00:48:42.297
- No. no.
there's something at home.

1203
00:48:42.339 --> 00:48:44.174
something generational.

1204
00:48:44.215 --> 00:48:46.217
something very early.
- Stop. I think she's coming.

1205
00:48:46.259 --> 00:48:48.178
- Is she empty-handed?
- She has a round of drinks.

1206
00:48:48.219 --> 00:48:50.680
- She has a round? Okay.
I'm gonna turn ever so lightly.

1207
00:48:50.722 --> 00:48:53.391
She smiled. John.
so it's happening.

1208
00:48:53.433 --> 00:48:55.143
- There's a little smile
creeping on her face.

1209
00:48:55.185 --> 00:48:56.561
Here she comes.

1210
00:48:56.603 --> 00:48:58.646
- We can settle into the fact
that it's happening.

1211
00:48:58.688 --> 00:49:00.899
- It's happening.
She knows how it works.

1212
00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.109
- [gasps]

1213
00:49:03.151 --> 00:49:05.403
Oh.

1214
00:49:06.613 --> 00:49:09.657
- [scoffs] Unbelievable.

1215
00:49:09.699 --> 00:49:11.785
That's our round.
- That's our round.

1216
00:49:11.826 --> 00:49:14.496
Unbelievable.
- [sighs]

1217
00:49:14.537 --> 00:49:16.081
- Unbelievable.

1218
00:49:16.122 --> 00:49:18.291
- I haven't wanted to say this.
but she's charmless.

1219
00:49:18.333 --> 00:49:20.502
- She's charmless.
- The distaste.

1220
00:49:20.543 --> 00:49:23.004
The poor taste in that. John.
- The gall.

1221
00:49:23.046 --> 00:49:25.840
- To not have the gall.
the sense of self enough

1222
00:49:25.882 --> 00:49:28.968
to buck up. smile.
and. "I'm a fan."

1223
00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:30.845
- I'd like to have
a word with her.

1224
00:49:30.887 --> 00:49:33.139
- I'd like to follow her home.
give her a little scare.

1225
00:49:33.181 --> 00:49:34.891
- Give her a little scare.
- Knock on her door.

1226
00:49:34.933 --> 00:49:37.143
Finally she opens it.
Then the look on her face--

1227
00:49:37.185 --> 00:49:40.772
I can go. "Ah. so now
you acknowledge the work?"

1228
00:49:40.814 --> 00:49:42.816
- She's coming. She's fucking
coming to the table.

1229
00:49:42.857 --> 00:49:44.693
- Is she?
Well. you'll notice...

1230
00:49:44.734 --> 00:49:47.654
- Yeah. no round.
- [scoffs]

1231
00:49:47.696 --> 00:49:50.532
- Right here with your check.
No rush. of course.

1232
00:49:50.573 --> 00:49:53.576
- Why do I feel rushed?
- Oh. I'm sorry.

1233
00:49:53.618 --> 00:49:56.746
I just have to say.
I'm a huge fan.

1234
00:49:56.788 --> 00:49:59.499
I-I grew up on
"He's Gay. She's Half-Jewish."

1235
00:49:59.541 --> 00:50:02.043
and to have you two
together like this.

1236
00:50:02.085 --> 00:50:03.878
it really brings me joy.

1237
00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.881
So the banana split's
on me tonight.

1238
00:50:06.923 --> 00:50:09.759
- Oh. thanks. doll.
- Thank you. doll.

1239
00:50:09.801 --> 00:50:11.511
[chuckles]
- Huh. Okay.

1240
00:50:11.553 --> 00:50:12.929
- Now. that's class.

1241
00:50:12.971 --> 00:50:15.056
- And did you see
the color in her cheeks?

1242
00:50:15.098 --> 00:50:16.182
- Mm-hmm. that's grace.

1243
00:50:16.224 --> 00:50:18.268
- I'll just say it once.
Was that so hard?

1244
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:19.477
- Was that so hard?

1245
00:50:19.519 --> 00:50:22.564
No. What an angel
and such poise.

1246
00:50:22.605 --> 00:50:24.441
- Such a way of her.
such a zest.

1247
00:50:24.482 --> 00:50:26.401
- Yes. Yeah. of course.
- Real something.

1248
00:50:26.443 --> 00:50:29.237
- You know. I would love to
know her story. pick her brain.

1249
00:50:29.279 --> 00:50:31.656
Actually. we should get her
back here--where is she?

1250
00:50:31.698 --> 00:50:33.950
- We'll get her name
when we leave.

1251
00:50:33.992 --> 00:50:36.369
- I just want to leave--
- I'll ask them maître d'.

1252
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:38.663
- [muttering to self]

1253
00:50:38.705 --> 00:50:41.833
- You know. they still make
my favorite wedge...

1254
00:50:41.875 --> 00:50:44.419
- It's an impeccable
wedge salad.

1255
00:50:44.461 --> 00:50:46.087
Oh. dear. Oh.

1256
00:50:46.129 --> 00:50:48.590
Here we go.

1257
00:50:48.631 --> 00:50:50.342
- [sniffs] How long was I out?

1258
00:50:50.383 --> 00:50:51.384
Kate?
- No time.

1259
00:50:51.426 --> 00:50:52.635
- Kate?
- No one saw.

1260
00:50:52.677 --> 00:50:54.346
- Kate. where are you?
- Right here. darling.

1261
00:50:54.387 --> 00:50:55.764
- Where are you?
- Right here. doll.

1262
00:50:55.805 --> 00:50:57.140
Dollface. right here.
- Oh. there you are.

1263
00:50:57.182 --> 00:50:59.642
- No one saw.
- You absolutely sure?

1264
00:50:59.684 --> 00:51:01.770
- Absolutely sure.
- All right. [clears throat]

1265
00:51:01.811 --> 00:51:05.106
- Do I have anything
in my teeth?

1266
00:51:05.148 --> 00:51:06.232
- No.

1267
00:51:06.274 --> 00:51:08.193
Do I?

1268
00:51:08.234 --> 00:51:09.527
- All clear.

1269
00:51:09.569 --> 00:51:10.987
- All right.

1270
00:51:11.029 --> 00:51:14.657
Mm. mine's ready.
- Mine too.

1271
00:51:16.159 --> 00:51:20.038
both: One. two.
together on three. and three.

1272
00:51:22.332 --> 00:51:23.333
- All right.

1273
00:51:23.375 --> 00:51:26.294
<i>[light music]</i>

1274
00:51:26.336 --> 00:51:29.381
<i>* *</i>

1275
00:51:29.422 --> 00:51:32.801
- [grunting]

1276
00:51:32.842 --> 00:51:34.761
[John mumbling. Kate humming]

1277
00:51:34.803 --> 00:51:36.721
- Oops. missed a sleeve.

1278
00:51:36.763 --> 00:51:41.434
<i>* *</i>

1279
00:51:41.476 --> 00:51:44.688
Bye.
[laughs]

1280
00:51:44.729 --> 00:51:47.148
Yeah. it's us.

1281
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:49.442
- A sidecar and a martini--
love it.

1282
00:51:49.484 --> 00:51:51.319
- Oh.
[laughs]

1283
00:51:51.361 --> 00:51:53.446
Uh...
- Yeah.

1284
00:51:53.488 --> 00:51:55.573
- Hello. hello. hello.

1285
00:51:55.615 --> 00:51:57.492
How are you?

1286
00:51:57.534 --> 00:52:00.328
- Enjoy.
[John speaking indistinctly]

1287
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:01.830
Why don't I take
a lap over there?

1288
00:52:01.871 --> 00:52:03.373
'Cause you already
got that side.

1289
00:52:03.415 --> 00:52:06.001
- Oh. I didn't get that far.
Yes. it's us. it's us.

1290
00:52:06.042 --> 00:52:08.003
- You can say something.
Don't be shy.

1291
00:52:08.044 --> 00:52:10.672
We don't bite.
[chuckles]

1292
00:52:10.714 --> 00:52:13.091
- Oh. they're
in our usual booth.

1293
00:52:13.133 --> 00:52:15.343
Your meal's on us.
I'm kidding.

1294
00:52:15.385 --> 00:52:18.513
[both laughing]

1295
00:52:18.555 --> 00:52:20.932
Oh. very nice. a prime rib.

1296
00:52:22.851 --> 00:52:26.229
- Now. where--I'm lost.
I'm lost.
