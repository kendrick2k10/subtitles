Louis: How many clients
have you seen this week?

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.758
Woman: Five or six.

5
00:00:10.862 --> 00:00:13.689
You take the cash before
anything happens?

6
00:00:13.793 --> 00:00:15.862
- Yes. I do. Yes.
- And count it?

7
00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:18.517
- Yes. I always count it
in front of them.

8
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.689
- Yeah. I would find that
embarrassing if I was an escort.

9
00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:25.000
But I'm not.
but Caroline's more mercenary.

10
00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:29.344
- [sighs] I'm ready.

11
00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:31.241
- Mmm. Mmm. OK.

12
00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:36.448
- But I just wanted to say that
I belong to you.

13
00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:40.310
I'm yours. but I want to give
myself to another man...

14
00:00:40.413 --> 00:00:42.379
- Mmm.
- ..for an hour.

15
00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:47.689
So I just wondered if you could
give me away to him?

16
00:00:47.793 --> 00:00:51.586
- OK. darling. Yes. I give you
away to Dave for the hour.

17
00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:53.241
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

18
00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:55.310
- Mmm. Thank you.
- [they kiss]

00:00:55.413 --> 00:00:57.862
[soft solemn music]

20
00:01:00.068 --> 00:01:02.482
Louis: For several months.
I've been spending time with

21
00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:05.758
women around Britain who legally
sell sex for a living.

22
00:01:05.862 --> 00:01:07.448
- Bah! [laughs]

23
00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:10.827
- Fuelled by websites
and social media.

24
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:13.034
a new economy has emerged.

25
00:01:13.137 --> 00:01:15.655
bringing a world of
transactional sex

26
00:01:15.758 --> 00:01:18.931
to people who might never
previously have considered it.

27
00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:22.068
- [reads] A splendidly
satisfactory young lady.

28
00:01:22.172 --> 00:01:24.482
- Wow! That one's almost.
I don't know. written in...

29
00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:25.517
- Eloquent.

30
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.482
- ..sort of Victorian English.
- [laughs]

31
00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:31.275
But the act still carries
a weight of stigma.

32
00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:33.896
and many view it as damaging
and degrading.

33
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.689
- People say that I'm a bad mum
and stuff like that.

34
00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:38.310
'cause I do what I do.

35
00:01:38.413 --> 00:01:40.862
But. you know.
we're just providing a service.

36
00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:42.172
that's what we're doing.

37
00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:45.758
- Raising the question of
whether selling sex

38
00:01:45.862 --> 00:01:48.896
can ever be a healthy way
to make money.

39
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.482
[reads] I'm very relaxed
and will give you a genuine.

40
00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:56.413
not acted.
real girlfriend experience.

41
00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:59.517
I promise you that we will have
a time you will never forget.

42
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.206
[soft music]

43
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.000
[computer keystrokes]

44
00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:19.000
In Nottingham.
I had a breakfast appointment.

45
00:02:19.103 --> 00:02:20.379
[knock on door]

46
00:02:23.586 --> 00:02:25.310
- Hi! Louis.
- Hello!

47
00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:26.689
- Are you Victoria?
- I am.

48
00:02:26.793 --> 00:02:27.896
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

49
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.620
- Can we come in?
- Yeah. come on in.

50
00:02:32.034 --> 00:02:33.758
What do you want. you lot?

51
00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.793
Who's having toast?

52
00:02:35.896 --> 00:02:39.172
- At 33 years old. Victoria.
her working name.

53
00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:42.931
is a single mum and sole
provider for her family.

54
00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:44.689
- No.
- Kid: Yeah!

55
00:02:44.793 --> 00:02:46.344
- For the last 4.5 years.

56
00:02:46.448 --> 00:02:48.482
she's worked in
the sex industry.

57
00:02:48.586 --> 00:02:52.000
- How many children do you have?
- Four.

58
00:02:52.103 --> 00:02:55.000
- Socks would be a bonus
at some point. wouldn't they?

59
00:02:55.103 --> 00:02:58.689
- Listen to Mummy. You need to
go and put your socks on.

60
00:02:58.793 --> 00:03:00.103
- Kid: Yay!

61
00:03:00.206 --> 00:03:02.379
- Victoria: Bye!
- Louis: Bye!

62
00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:05.379
- I'll let you sit on
the comfy chair. [laughs]

63
00:03:05.482 --> 00:03:06.896
This is me. yeah.

64
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.758
- Like an increasing number
of women who sell sex.

65
00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:12.448
Victoria finds her clients
through social media

66
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:15.137
and a website called Adult Work.

67
00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:17.724
- So. I'll show you my profile.

68
00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:20.689
- Is that you?
- That's me. yeah.

69
00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:22.827
- [reads] Classy Filth69.

70
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:26.793
I'm very honest. caring. upfront
and extremely classy lady.

71
00:03:26.896 --> 00:03:29.068
who enjoys all the finer things
in life.

72
00:03:29.172 --> 00:03:30.724
but when it comes to
the bedroom.

73
00:03:30.827 --> 00:03:33.448
I'm the most naughtiest.
filthiest lady

74
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:35.275
you would ever meet.

75
00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.344
- What do you think?

76
00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:38.413
- It's the Yin and the Yang.
I like it.

77
00:03:38.517 --> 00:03:40.103
- Yeah.

78
00:03:40.206 --> 00:03:42.310
- And how many bookings would
you expect to get on a day

79
00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:44.379
when you are on?

80
00:03:44.482 --> 00:03:46.103
- I normally get about four.

81
00:03:48.275 --> 00:03:49.931
- So. that...
- Four in one day?

82
00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:51.758
- Yeah.
So you gotta understand

83
00:03:51.862 --> 00:03:54.793
I still like to take
the children to school.

84
00:03:54.896 --> 00:03:57.172
so. and then I'll try
and do my bookings.

85
00:03:57.275 --> 00:03:59.551
the majority of them. while
the children are at school.

86
00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:01.724
- It's important to you
to be around for the kids?

87
00:04:01.827 --> 00:04:04.275
- Yeah. So. I always say. like.

88
00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.655
my main job is to be a mother.

89
00:04:06.758 --> 00:04:10.344
Then the second is.
obviously. work.

90
00:04:10.448 --> 00:04:16.206
That's why this is a perfect job
for me. you know?

91
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.034
Flexible.

92
00:04:23.172 --> 00:04:25.689
- Louis: Victoria never
takes bookings at home.

93
00:04:25.793 --> 00:04:27.275
She does most of her
appointments

94
00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:29.172
at hotels around Nottingham.

95
00:04:29.275 --> 00:04:32.413
charging around 250 pounds
an hour.

96
00:04:32.517 --> 00:04:35.517
How much do we know about
this guy? This client?

97
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.103
- I've seen him practically.
like. once a week he sees me.

98
00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:42.758
He's a single guy.

99
00:04:42.862 --> 00:04:48.655
He can just keep going and going
and going and going.

100
00:04:48.758 --> 00:04:50.620
- Are you aware of there being

101
00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.862
a degree of danger
involved in the work?

102
00:04:53.965 --> 00:04:56.931
- There's a danger in anything.
isn't there?

103
00:04:57.034 --> 00:05:01.310
And I think that this
is a lot less dangerous

104
00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:05.344
than me on a night out.
being drunk and meeting somebody

105
00:05:05.448 --> 00:05:07.793
and going back to a hotel
with somebody.

106
00:05:07.896 --> 00:05:11.241
But I think you just
have to be on guard.

107
00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.827
[soft music]

108
00:05:15.862 --> 00:05:17.965
- Have you worked
in this one before?

109
00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.655
- Yes.

110
00:05:22.448 --> 00:05:23.793
- Do you need to get into...
- I need to get changed.

111
00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:24.793
- I need to jump in the shower.

112
00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:26.448
- You need to get into
game mode. Yeah.

113
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.068
[shower running]

114
00:05:31.172 --> 00:05:32.551
[phone chimes]

115
00:05:36.482 --> 00:05:38.103
- I'm coming.

116
00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:41.448
Going and going. isn't it?

117
00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:44.000
That's it. I'm dressed now.

118
00:05:44.103 --> 00:05:46.620
- That's all the jobs coming.
- Is it?

119
00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:48.034
- Yeah.
- It's popping off?

120
00:05:48.137 --> 00:05:49.586
- Yeah. it's dinner time.

121
00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:51.172
- Dinner time.
- Yeah. break time.

122
00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:52.655
- Right.
People on their lunch break...

123
00:05:52.758 --> 00:05:54.517
- Yeah.
- Popping out for a quickie.

124
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.655
- Yeah.

125
00:05:57.551 --> 00:05:59.448
[knock on door]

126
00:06:01.068 --> 00:06:04.344
- With the client arriving.
it was time for me to leave.

127
00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:19.931
The exchange of sex for money
is legal in Britain

128
00:06:20.034 --> 00:06:23.379
so long as it doesn't involve
coercion. exploitation

129
00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:25.689
or any kind of public nuisance.

130
00:06:26.896 --> 00:06:29.172
And with the advent
of social media

131
00:06:29.275 --> 00:06:32.413
and specialist websites
it is on the rise.

132
00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:37.241
Technology has made sexual
services more accessible

133
00:06:37.344 --> 00:06:40.620
than ever before.
with every taste catered to.

134
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:46.068
Users can see photos.
check reviews

135
00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.758
and offer feedback.

136
00:06:49.344 --> 00:06:50.517
But the age old issue

137
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.965
of whether sex should ever be
traded remains.

138
00:06:54.068 --> 00:06:57.068
[pensive music]

139
00:07:01.517 --> 00:07:03.379
A growing number
of those involved

140
00:07:03.482 --> 00:07:06.000
are said to be students
trying to make ends meet

141
00:07:06.103 --> 00:07:08.620
while they pursue an education.

142
00:07:08.724 --> 00:07:11.827
In South West London
I was meeting a 23-year-old

143
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.000
in her final year of art school.

144
00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:17.724
- Hello!
- Come in.

145
00:07:17.827 --> 00:07:19.241
- Are you Ashleigh?
- That's me.

146
00:07:19.344 --> 00:07:21.137
- Louis. How do you do?
- Hi! Can we hug instead?

147
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:22.241
- Of course.
- [laughs]

148
00:07:22.344 --> 00:07:24.034
- Louis: For several years.
Ashleigh had streamed

149
00:07:24.137 --> 00:07:27.379
live sex shows from home
for money.

150
00:07:27.482 --> 00:07:30.724
Six weeks earlier she'd taken
the step of opening an account

151
00:07:30.827 --> 00:07:32.827
on an industry website.

152
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:35.413
- Welcome! [laughs]
- I like it. Top floor.

153
00:07:35.517 --> 00:07:37.586
Ashleigh also has Asperger's.

154
00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:40.551
She lives with her best friend.
Georgina.

155
00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:43.931
It's really nice.
It's got so much character.

156
00:07:46.793 --> 00:07:48.862
So I understand you've got
a booking tonight?

157
00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:50.206
- Yeah. at eight o'clock.

158
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.689
- Did it come through
Adult Work?

159
00:07:51.793 --> 00:07:53.413
- Yeah. So. I put myself
as available

160
00:07:53.517 --> 00:07:54.862
at about three o'clock today.

161
00:07:54.965 --> 00:07:57.655
and this guy messaged me.
being like. "Oh. I'm in Fulham.

162
00:07:57.758 --> 00:07:59.103
"Can you come out for an hour?"

163
00:07:59.206 --> 00:08:01.379
And he was. like. "I'm 25.
5 foot 10. same height as you.

164
00:08:01.482 --> 00:08:03.551
"Clean." Like. I know.

165
00:08:03.655 --> 00:08:06.413
Like. it's gonna...
Yeah. it should be fine.

166
00:08:06.517 --> 00:08:08.620
- Have you got reviews
of the guy?

167
00:08:08.724 --> 00:08:10.034
- That I'm going to see?
- Yeah.

168
00:08:10.137 --> 00:08:11.758
- OK. let me have a look.
- Have you looked at them?

169
00:08:11.862 --> 00:08:13.620
- No. Let me go and look.

170
00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.586
Well. they were all positive
so. like. that was fine.

171
00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:18.517
- Yeah. If you go on it
and they're all positive...

172
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.448
- So. he's got 498.
- ..there's not really a...

173
00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:23.620
- [gasps]
- Louis: Reviews?

174
00:08:23.724 --> 00:08:27.965
- Yeah. "Good guy. Big cock.
Knows how to use it." Ah!

175
00:08:28.068 --> 00:08:29.310
[laughs]

176
00:08:29.413 --> 00:08:33.137
"One hour full of orgasms
and pleasure. Kiss. kiss. kiss."

177
00:08:33.241 --> 00:08:36.310
- "Expected someone coy. Was
instead surprised by a real man.

178
00:08:36.413 --> 00:08:39.793
"someone who genuinely taught me
so much about my own body."

179
00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:41.034
- Maybe I'm in for a wild ride
tonight.

180
00:08:41.137 --> 00:08:42.034
- Wow!

181
00:08:42.137 --> 00:08:43.586
- "Handsome and possessed great
skill."

182
00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:46.103
- Who knows? Maybe I'll come out
a different woman?

183
00:08:46.206 --> 00:08:47.448
- Sounds like you've got someone

184
00:08:47.551 --> 00:08:49.206
who's been around the block
a few times.

185
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.206
- Oh. I'm ready for it.
Bring it on. bitch!

186
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.241
[laughter]

187
00:08:52.344 --> 00:08:54.034
- Brm. brm! Can I get dressed?
- Yeah. please. Yeah.

188
00:08:54.137 --> 00:08:56.379
- I'm getting nervous. Sorry.
Brm. brm! [chuckles]

189
00:09:03.172 --> 00:09:05.551
- Gonna be really late.
- Well. let's just go then.

190
00:09:05.655 --> 00:09:07.103
- [laughs]
- Let's go.

191
00:09:07.206 --> 00:09:08.827
- I'll just be. like. "Ah. ah!"

192
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:16.793
- How are you feeling?

193
00:09:16.896 --> 00:09:21.517
- I'm fine. to be honest. I'm.
like. excited. It's quite fun.

194
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.793
Like. it's like going out.
but without the commitment.

195
00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:25.724
'cause it's only one hour
and I can leave.

196
00:09:25.827 --> 00:09:27.517
- How many bookings
would you say you've had

197
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.241
in the six weeks
you've been doing it?

198
00:09:29.344 --> 00:09:31.620
- Oh. gosh. 50?

199
00:09:31.724 --> 00:09:33.758
Yeah. maybe? Yeah.

200
00:09:35.586 --> 00:09:37.137
- That's quite a lot. isn't it?

201
00:09:38.206 --> 00:09:40.068
- I know that a lot of people
say. like.

202
00:09:40.172 --> 00:09:41.724
"Oh. you don't have to do this."

203
00:09:41.827 --> 00:09:43.551
like. you know.
"Saviour complex."

204
00:09:43.655 --> 00:09:46.310
Like. I don't need to be saved.
I'm doing it on my own terms.

205
00:09:46.413 --> 00:09:48.965
and I'm actually in power
in this situation.

206
00:09:49.068 --> 00:09:52.758
And I feel empowered by it.
and if that's how I feel.

207
00:09:52.862 --> 00:09:55.241
then that's all that matters
really. you know what I mean?

208
00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:59.068
- Would you expect to have
an orgasm if you had sex?

209
00:09:59.172 --> 00:10:02.965
- No. I think that I'm. like.
a bit closed off with

210
00:10:03.068 --> 00:10:05.620
letting myself
have the enjoyment.

211
00:10:05.724 --> 00:10:07.241
It's more about the scenario.

212
00:10:07.344 --> 00:10:10.310
I will orgasm if I'm in a
scenario where I feel calm

213
00:10:10.413 --> 00:10:14.655
and comfortable. as opposed to.
like. the actual pleasure.

214
00:10:14.758 --> 00:10:16.517
- But you'd expect to be
aroused?

215
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.827
- Well. I just get aroused
by being touched.

216
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:19.862
- Do you?

217
00:10:19.965 --> 00:10:22.413
- Yeah. like. if you were to put
your arm on my leg right now.

218
00:10:22.517 --> 00:10:23.620
I'd probably be aroused.

219
00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:27.068
Like. people always compliment
me. I guess. being. like.

220
00:10:27.172 --> 00:10:29.206
"Oh. you're always so wet.
You must be so into it."

221
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.310
And I'm just. like. "Honey.
I'm always wet." like...

222
00:10:31.413 --> 00:10:33.620
[laughs] I'm just aroused
a lot of the time.'

223
00:10:33.724 --> 00:10:36.793
Yeah. [laughs]

224
00:10:42.172 --> 00:10:45.000
- OK. then.
- [laughs]

225
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.344
Let me just have a cigarette.
[laughs]

226
00:10:52.137 --> 00:10:54.000
[solemn music]

227
00:10:56.344 --> 00:10:59.172
- With a moment to myself.
I reflected on the strangeness

228
00:10:59.275 --> 00:11:01.448
of what was taking place.

229
00:11:04.137 --> 00:11:06.241
Behind a closed door.
Ashleigh was providing

230
00:11:06.344 --> 00:11:09.827
what is usually understood to be
the most intimate physical act

231
00:11:09.931 --> 00:11:11.827
to a stranger for money.

232
00:11:15.413 --> 00:11:17.344
I wondered whether she was safe

233
00:11:17.448 --> 00:11:19.827
and how she really felt
about what was happening.

234
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.310
An hour later. she re-emerged.

235
00:11:35.689 --> 00:11:37.310
- How was it?
- It was great!

236
00:11:37.413 --> 00:11:39.655
- I don't know. he was. like.
I'm 23. he was. like. 25.

237
00:11:39.758 --> 00:11:43.137
and he had. like. nice hair.
and he was kind of. like.

238
00:11:43.241 --> 00:11:44.448
cool. I guess.

239
00:11:44.551 --> 00:11:45.862
- And I was just. like...
- Really?

240
00:11:45.965 --> 00:11:48.310
- "I would date you. I don't
know why you're paying me.

241
00:11:48.413 --> 00:11:49.862
"'cause I would go on a date
with you."

242
00:11:49.965 --> 00:11:53.862
And I said to him. I was like.
"Why do you use Adult Work?

243
00:11:53.965 --> 00:11:57.034
"Like. why not just go on Tinder
or whatever?"

244
00:11:57.137 --> 00:11:58.482
And he was like.
"On the weekend.

245
00:11:58.586 --> 00:12:01.137
"it's popping off on Tinder.
During the week. not so much.

246
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:03.724
"Everyone's got a job. so gotta
get on the old Adult Work

247
00:12:03.827 --> 00:12:06.206
"and it's less. like.
commitment. innit?"

248
00:12:07.482 --> 00:12:10.655
- Well. I'm just conscious
that you are six weeks in.

249
00:12:10.758 --> 00:12:12.172
- It's still really...
- Early days.

250
00:12:12.275 --> 00:12:13.931
- ..early days.
- Exactly.

251
00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:16.620
I've been so lucky
with the clients that I've got

252
00:12:16.724 --> 00:12:20.103
and the way that. like.
it's gone for me.

253
00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:22.344
- So. now you are feeling.
what's in your...

254
00:12:22.448 --> 00:12:25.344
- I feel great.
I've got money in my bag.

255
00:12:25.448 --> 00:12:27.379
I've been sexually satisfied.

256
00:12:27.482 --> 00:12:30.965
[laughs] I'm gonna go home
and order a pizza.

257
00:12:31.068 --> 00:12:34.310
Probably chain smoke
some Marlboro cigarettes.

258
00:12:34.413 --> 00:12:36.172
menthol at the moment.

259
00:12:38.448 --> 00:12:40.241
[solemn music]

260
00:12:44.068 --> 00:12:47.965
[plane engine]

261
00:12:56.793 --> 00:12:59.172
- Louis: The common criticism
of selling sex.

262
00:12:59.275 --> 00:13:01.379
that the act is necessarily
intimate

263
00:13:01.482 --> 00:13:03.275
and should not be traded.

264
00:13:03.379 --> 00:13:04.896
is made even more real

265
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.448
when the person involved
is in a relationship.

266
00:13:09.931 --> 00:13:12.448
I was curious to meet a woman
participating in

267
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:16.000
the sexual economy but who is
part of a committed couple.

268
00:13:19.724 --> 00:13:20.827
- Hello!
- Hi!

269
00:13:20.931 --> 00:13:22.068
- Can I come in?
- Come in.

270
00:13:22.172 --> 00:13:23.068
- How are you?

271
00:13:23.172 --> 00:13:25.068
In West Sussex.
I was with Caroline.

272
00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:27.931
who describes herself
as an escort.

273
00:13:28.034 --> 00:13:30.862
and her husband of 44 years.
Graham.

274
00:13:30.965 --> 00:13:32.448
a chartered surveyor.

275
00:13:36.827 --> 00:13:38.793
- On my wedding day was
one of the first times

276
00:13:38.896 --> 00:13:41.172
I discovered that I loved being
the centre of attention.

277
00:13:41.275 --> 00:13:42.310
- Mmm.

278
00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:45.655
How old were you both?

279
00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:49.206
- I was 19. and Graham was 23.

280
00:13:50.448 --> 00:13:53.413
- And you were both virgins?
- Mm-hm.

281
00:13:53.517 --> 00:13:54.448
- Yeah.

282
00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:56.620
- Because you'd come from
quite a religious upbringing.

283
00:13:56.724 --> 00:13:58.586
- both of you.
- Yes. Yeah.

284
00:13:58.689 --> 00:14:02.482
It wasn't the done thing to have
sex before you got married.

285
00:14:02.586 --> 00:14:05.241
Graham would have done.
if I'd let him.

286
00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:06.551
- But must be quite difficult.

287
00:14:06.655 --> 00:14:09.137
Neither of you
with any sexual experience

288
00:14:09.241 --> 00:14:11.206
attempting to have sex
for the first time?

289
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.379
- Yeah. Yes. it was interesting.
- Graham: Did it work?

290
00:14:13.482 --> 00:14:14.517
- No.
- Oh!

291
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.620
[laughter]

292
00:14:15.724 --> 00:14:17.448
- Didn't go very well?
- Didn't go very well.

293
00:14:17.551 --> 00:14:20.551
- It wasn't a revelatory
experience?

294
00:14:20.655 --> 00:14:22.482
- No.
- Do you remember it?

295
00:14:22.586 --> 00:14:25.241
- [laughs]
- Vaguely. Not very well. No.

296
00:14:25.344 --> 00:14:26.551
- [laughs]

297
00:14:26.655 --> 00:14:29.275
- It was just on the M1.
wasn't it? Trying to get North.

298
00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:31.413
- [laughs]
- Newport Pagnell.

299
00:14:31.517 --> 00:14:33.482
- Oh. yeah! [laughs]
- Is that a metaphor?

300
00:14:33.586 --> 00:14:35.724
- Well. no. it was Newport...
- We went... [laughs]

301
00:14:35.827 --> 00:14:38.206
We went to the Lake District
for our honeymoon.

302
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.965
so we stopped halfway
in a Travelodge overnight.

303
00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:45.862
- It took a while for you to get
comfortable with your sexuality?

304
00:14:45.965 --> 00:14:47.344
- Yeah. Definitely. Yeah.

305
00:14:47.448 --> 00:14:49.965
I mean. it took quite a few
years. in fact.

306
00:14:50.068 --> 00:14:51.517
Quite a few years.

307
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.655
[soft music]

308
00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.448
- Put your head down over...

309
00:15:00.551 --> 00:15:02.758
- Louis: Downstairs. Caroline
and Graham had arranged

310
00:15:02.862 --> 00:15:05.310
a photo shoot
for Caroline's social media

311
00:15:05.413 --> 00:15:07.931
to attract more clients.

312
00:15:08.034 --> 00:15:11.275
What sort of work did you
do before this. Caroline?

313
00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:12.793
- Dental nursing.

314
00:15:12.896 --> 00:15:15.275
I'm still a qualified
dental nurse.

315
00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:17.275
but I don't really do it
much anymore.

316
00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:19.275
- Do you want to do an explicit
one with your bra off?

317
00:15:19.379 --> 00:15:21.206
- OK.

318
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.758
- When you decided to do it.
was it for the money

319
00:15:24.862 --> 00:15:28.068
or the adventure
or the pleasure of the sex?

320
00:15:28.172 --> 00:15:30.068
- I never thought about being
an escort

321
00:15:30.172 --> 00:15:32.689
until we met some friends
on holiday

322
00:15:32.793 --> 00:15:34.793
when we were in
the South of France.

323
00:15:34.896 --> 00:15:38.034
and she told us
that she was an escort.

324
00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:42.000
Probably took me about a year
to come to the decision.

325
00:15:42.103 --> 00:15:44.068
But when she first said it.
Graham said.

326
00:15:44.172 --> 00:15:45.793
"Ooh. you ought to do that."

327
00:15:45.896 --> 00:15:47.275
- I was joking. to be honest.

328
00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:50.965
- He was joking
but one percent serious.

329
00:15:52.068 --> 00:15:53.344
You know. I struggle with.

330
00:15:53.448 --> 00:15:57.275
or have done over the years.
with my self-esteem.

331
00:15:57.379 --> 00:16:01.379
So this helps me to see myself
in a better light.

332
00:16:01.482 --> 00:16:05.655
when I can see that lots of men
want to come and see me

333
00:16:05.758 --> 00:16:07.931
and they fancy me.

334
00:16:08.034 --> 00:16:10.827
It makes me feel better
about myself.

335
00:16:10.931 --> 00:16:14.482
And now Graham's my biggest
encourager.

336
00:16:17.275 --> 00:16:19.862
- Right. Now turn round
to face the mirror.

337
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.482
Yeah. That's great.

338
00:16:26.413 --> 00:16:29.275
[soft music]

339
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.275
- Louis: I was back in
Nottingham with Victoria.

340
00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:43.413
I'd been curious to get to know
a little more about her.

341
00:16:45.206 --> 00:16:48.103
I knew she'd had to rebuild her
life five years earlier

342
00:16:48.206 --> 00:16:50.275
when she'd left the father of
her children.

343
00:16:50.379 --> 00:16:51.862
Tell me if you need a hand
with anything.

344
00:16:51.965 --> 00:16:54.172
She'd also told me she'd had
a difficult upbringing.

345
00:16:54.275 --> 00:16:56.827
moving out of the family home
at 14.

346
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.068
I wondered how that had
affected her later on.

347
00:17:03.482 --> 00:17:06.551
She was getting her kit bag
ready for an appointment.

348
00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:10.413
- Oh. I'm so disorganised.

349
00:17:10.517 --> 00:17:11.482
- What were you looking for?

350
00:17:11.586 --> 00:17:13.620
- A stocking.
I only had one stocking.

351
00:17:13.724 --> 00:17:14.931
- Oh.

352
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.310
- [laughs]

353
00:17:17.413 --> 00:17:19.000
- This is gonna sound like
a really weird.

354
00:17:19.103 --> 00:17:20.758
open-ended question. OK. but.

355
00:17:20.862 --> 00:17:23.068
what do you think is
the right way of doing it?

356
00:17:23.172 --> 00:17:24.758
- What's the right way
of doing sex?

357
00:17:24.862 --> 00:17:27.517
- Mmm.
- Everybody's different.

358
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.655
Everybody's different.
aren't they?

359
00:17:31.034 --> 00:17:32.689
So...

360
00:17:32.793 --> 00:17:34.724
- For you. then.
- For me?

361
00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:41.241
I see having a cuddle as sex.
[laughs]

362
00:17:42.931 --> 00:17:47.689
I've had. like.
so many bad sexual experiences.

363
00:17:47.793 --> 00:17:51.068
like. people just abusing me.
taking everything from me

364
00:17:51.172 --> 00:17:55.689
from being 14. that I just think
there's nothing...

365
00:17:55.793 --> 00:17:57.896
I can just easily do it.
There's nothing...

366
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.517
There's no good connection there
through sex.

367
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.862
So I've turned it around.

368
00:18:03.965 --> 00:18:07.413
so I've got an ability to be
able to have sex with anybody

369
00:18:07.517 --> 00:18:11.793
and it not mean anything.
so I can easily go do my job.

370
00:18:11.896 --> 00:18:12.862
Do you know what I mean?

371
00:18:12.965 --> 00:18:14.758
So I just look at it
in a positive way.

372
00:18:15.724 --> 00:18:18.517
[laughs] Is that bad? [laughs]

373
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.275
- Does it feel bad?

374
00:18:22.379 --> 00:18:23.931
- No. No.

375
00:18:24.034 --> 00:18:29.310
I'm not doing anything wrong
or illegal.

376
00:18:29.413 --> 00:18:33.655
or anything that
people don't want to do.

377
00:18:33.758 --> 00:18:36.517
People want to do this.
People come to me. you know?

378
00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.103
I just use it as an advantage.

379
00:18:42.724 --> 00:18:46.827
Do you see what I mean? So...

380
00:18:46.931 --> 00:18:48.827
- Were you abused
when you were...

381
00:18:48.931 --> 00:18:50.965
Before you were 14.
were you abused?

382
00:18:51.068 --> 00:18:55.482
- No. 14. I was just
a stray of a kid. really.

383
00:18:55.586 --> 00:18:58.793
I was everywhere and everywhere.
so people took advantage.

384
00:19:00.827 --> 00:19:04.206
Especially one guy in
particular. who was 25.

385
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.137
Obviously. he just see me
as vulnerable. but...

386
00:19:13.137 --> 00:19:14.034
Yeah.

387
00:19:14.137 --> 00:19:15.655
- Someone who took advantage
of you?

388
00:19:15.758 --> 00:19:17.862
- Yeah. Yeah.

389
00:19:20.103 --> 00:19:22.689
So... [laughs]

390
00:19:22.793 --> 00:19:24.724
But when you're young
and when you're vulnerable

391
00:19:24.827 --> 00:19:27.896
and when you've got nowhere
to go and nothing to do.

392
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.172
you don't go to school.
you don't have really a home...

393
00:19:33.655 --> 00:19:35.517
and somebody shows an interest.

394
00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.517
you don't realise
it's just sexual.

395
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.724
You'd think that they care about
you and stuff like that.

396
00:19:40.827 --> 00:19:42.137
you know?

397
00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:46.448
So. I used to do all these
crazy sexual things

398
00:19:46.551 --> 00:19:47.689
to keep him happy.

399
00:19:49.241 --> 00:19:53.310
Yeah. sex is just not the same
for me as most people.

400
00:19:56.655 --> 00:20:00.482
I think that's the best way
to word it. I think.

401
00:20:02.275 --> 00:20:04.172
- Is that all that's coming?
I can carry that.

402
00:20:04.275 --> 00:20:06.931
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

403
00:20:07.034 --> 00:20:09.586
- Must be good for something.
- Oh. I'm hot now. [laughs]

404
00:20:11.034 --> 00:20:14.034
- Is that it?
- That's it. All done.

405
00:20:15.655 --> 00:20:18.551
[solemn music]

406
00:20:18.655 --> 00:20:21.482
- The revelation of Victoria's
abuse seemed to put her decision

407
00:20:21.586 --> 00:20:24.000
to sell sex
in a different light.

408
00:20:25.413 --> 00:20:27.965
Now seemed a side effect
of her upbringing.

409
00:20:28.068 --> 00:20:30.517
but whether that made it
the wrong lifestyle for her

410
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.241
was a different question.

411
00:20:36.103 --> 00:20:38.344
We were on our way
to another hotel.

412
00:20:38.448 --> 00:20:41.034
One of her regulars
had agreed to speak to me

413
00:20:41.137 --> 00:20:42.689
with his identity protected.

414
00:20:45.172 --> 00:20:46.517
[knock on door]

415
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.931
- Victoria: Hello!
- Louis: How are you doing?

416
00:20:49.034 --> 00:20:52.241
- Man: Nervous.
- Louis: Yeah. I can imagine.

417
00:20:52.344 --> 00:20:54.551
Victoria was saying that you've
been seeing each other

418
00:20:54.655 --> 00:20:56.448
for a couple of months.
wasn't it?

419
00:20:56.551 --> 00:20:57.862
- Couple of months. yeah.

420
00:20:57.965 --> 00:21:00.586
- How did you first
find out about her?

421
00:21:00.689 --> 00:21:03.172
- It was through
an online site actually.

422
00:21:03.275 --> 00:21:04.241
- Mmm.

423
00:21:04.344 --> 00:21:06.482
- Looked at Victoria's profile.
I went really. really deep

424
00:21:06.586 --> 00:21:09.482
into the research of.
like. what she's like.

425
00:21:09.586 --> 00:21:10.517
- As I understand it.

426
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.896
you were coming out of a
relationship. is that right?

427
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.206
- Yes. that's correct.
It had kinda gone dead.

428
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.034
In fact. there was no contact
anymore. no...

429
00:21:18.137 --> 00:21:19.310
- No physical side to it?

430
00:21:19.413 --> 00:21:21.931
- No physical side to it.
no emotional side to it.

431
00:21:22.034 --> 00:21:25.827
I was kinda crying out for
basically some attention.

432
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:27.172
- Mmm.

433
00:21:27.275 --> 00:21:31.310
Is the aim to get back to a kind
of girlfriend relationship?

434
00:21:31.413 --> 00:21:33.206
- I don't know what
I want at the minute.

435
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.000
I think I'm trying
to find my way

436
00:21:35.103 --> 00:21:37.413
of reconnecting with new
people again.

437
00:21:37.517 --> 00:21:40.379
And this has been kind of a big
help for that.

438
00:21:40.482 --> 00:21:43.241
It's actually been a big boost
of confidence for me.

439
00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:46.758
- I think this is. like.
a bit of fresh air.

440
00:21:46.862 --> 00:21:48.965
A breath of fresh air.
do you know what I mean?

441
00:21:49.068 --> 00:21:52.103
And I think without that.
that could...

442
00:21:52.206 --> 00:21:55.620
you could spiral down
into depression.

443
00:21:55.724 --> 00:21:57.344
- I could. Yeah.
like you say. I could...

444
00:21:57.448 --> 00:21:59.655
- Like. problem... I don't know.
That's my thinking.

445
00:21:59.758 --> 00:22:02.724
- Oh. yeah. No. I know I could
have spiralled out really badly.

446
00:22:02.827 --> 00:22:08.655
- Is it important for you
that Victoria enjoys

447
00:22:08.758 --> 00:22:10.586
having sex with you?

448
00:22:10.689 --> 00:22:12.448
- Oh. God. yeah.

449
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:15.689
I only want us to do things
that we both wanna do together.

450
00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:20.620
I'm not interested in meeting
somebody who's just...

451
00:22:20.724 --> 00:22:25.241
there to please me in that kinda
way and then leave it at that.

452
00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:28.310
- But at the same time.
we have to acknowledge

453
00:22:28.413 --> 00:22:31.689
that she would not be
having sex with you

454
00:22:31.793 --> 00:22:35.103
were it not for the professional
arrangement. right?

455
00:22:35.206 --> 00:22:37.068
- I would assume so.
- Yeah.

456
00:22:38.586 --> 00:22:40.137
- It's not something
I've actually given

457
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:41.689
a lot of thought to.

458
00:22:42.896 --> 00:22:45.275
I don't know where I sit
with that at the minute.

459
00:22:47.068 --> 00:22:50.482
[solemn music]

460
00:22:50.586 --> 00:22:53.034
- I was surprised
at the apparent vulnerability

461
00:22:53.137 --> 00:22:55.103
of Victoria's client

462
00:22:55.206 --> 00:22:57.206
and also by him
failing to consider

463
00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.655
whether Victoria
might not enjoy the sex.

464
00:23:02.275 --> 00:23:05.172
I wondered about the impact
on her

465
00:23:05.275 --> 00:23:09.000
of having to impersonate a level
of intimacy she didn't feel.

466
00:23:17.241 --> 00:23:19.551
[soft music]

467
00:23:21.586 --> 00:23:23.241
[child laughs]

468
00:23:23.344 --> 00:23:26.103
- Victoria: You can have your
TV on for a little bit.

469
00:23:26.206 --> 00:23:28.655
- Louis: later that day.
back at home.

470
00:23:28.758 --> 00:23:31.620
it was time for the evening
routine with the kids.

471
00:23:31.724 --> 00:23:34.758
Who's in this one. then?

472
00:23:34.862 --> 00:23:37.241
This is like being on
a submarine. this one.

473
00:23:37.344 --> 00:23:39.379
- Kid: Yeah!
- Whoa!

474
00:23:39.482 --> 00:23:42.000
- It's quite long. isn't it?
- Victoria: It's huge.

475
00:23:42.103 --> 00:23:43.965
- Uh-oh! There's a ninja.

476
00:23:44.068 --> 00:23:46.206
He's got a special way
of ninja walking.

477
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.241
[Victoria laughs]

478
00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:49.379
- He's so quiet
when he's ninja walking.

479
00:23:49.482 --> 00:23:50.931
[Victoria laughs]

480
00:23:51.034 --> 00:23:52.448
- He's ninja-walked away.

481
00:23:54.344 --> 00:23:57.068
Victoria had told me she planned
to tell her boys what she does

482
00:23:57.172 --> 00:23:58.793
when they're older.

483
00:23:58.896 --> 00:24:01.344
but she's made no secret of it
in the wider community

484
00:24:01.448 --> 00:24:03.655
Show me around.
What have we got in here?

485
00:24:03.758 --> 00:24:05.655
Among those in the know
is her daughter.

486
00:24:05.758 --> 00:24:09.103
14-year-old Sapphire.
who she told a year ago.

487
00:24:10.689 --> 00:24:12.724
We talked a little bit
downstairs. didn't we.

488
00:24:12.827 --> 00:24:14.620
about escorting?

489
00:24:14.724 --> 00:24:16.620
What's your view of it?

490
00:24:16.724 --> 00:24:19.206
- I think. if she wants to do
it. then it's her choice.

491
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:23.034
Nobody should. like.
not accept that.

492
00:24:23.137 --> 00:24:25.172
or nobody should say anything
bad about it

493
00:24:25.275 --> 00:24:26.655
because it's her decision.

494
00:24:26.758 --> 00:24:29.896
- Do you understand why some
people don't like it?

495
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.448
- Yeah. it's just a job that
people see as a negative job.

496
00:24:33.551 --> 00:24:37.068
Like. if you're in a bank.
that's a good job.

497
00:24:37.172 --> 00:24:40.655
If you're a cleaner.
that's seen as a bad job.

498
00:24:40.758 --> 00:24:42.793
It's just one of the jobs
that people don't like.

499
00:24:42.896 --> 00:24:45.586
and I think that because
she has children. as well.

500
00:24:45.689 --> 00:24:49.310
people are like. "That's setting
a bad example for your kids."

501
00:24:49.413 --> 00:24:53.137
But we don't mind.
Well. I don't mind. anyway.

502
00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:57.172
She's come from. like.
not having a lot

503
00:24:57.275 --> 00:25:02.448
to having everything that she
needs and a lot more. so.

504
00:25:02.551 --> 00:25:04.758
Yeah. really proud of her.

505
00:25:05.965 --> 00:25:07.896
- She seems like
she's a really good mum.

506
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.241
- She is.
She is a really good mum.

507
00:25:10.344 --> 00:25:12.379
[soft music]

508
00:25:14.689 --> 00:25:16.620
[child laughs]

509
00:25:16.724 --> 00:25:18.689
- Victoria: Bring me
your Lego box.

510
00:25:20.931 --> 00:25:23.379
- Louis: I left Victoria
struck by the contrast

511
00:25:23.482 --> 00:25:25.586
between a happy and stable home

512
00:25:25.689 --> 00:25:27.448
and the way that many would view
the work

513
00:25:27.551 --> 00:25:29.206
that was underpinning it.

514
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:32.379
[solemn music]

515
00:25:39.689 --> 00:25:42.551
It's hard to know how much
the cost of selling sex

516
00:25:42.655 --> 00:25:45.517
stems from the sense of
judgement it brings with it.

517
00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:49.275
But it's been suggested
that younger people

518
00:25:49.379 --> 00:25:51.586
may take a less critical view.

519
00:25:53.448 --> 00:25:55.068
I wondered what Ashleigh's
friends

520
00:25:55.172 --> 00:25:56.689
thought about her lifestyle

521
00:25:56.793 --> 00:26:00.068
and. so. I'd arranged to meet
some of them at a parent's house

522
00:26:00.172 --> 00:26:02.758
where they were discussing
a joint art project.

523
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:10.000
- We wanted to show the extremes
of. like. the sex work stuff.

524
00:26:10.103 --> 00:26:12.448
Louisa is our designer.

525
00:26:12.551 --> 00:26:14.103
- I've been brought on...
- Costume.

526
00:26:14.206 --> 00:26:16.206
- ..just to do costumes.
I'm not performing.

527
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:21.724
- Are you curious how Ashleigh's
found it so far. the sex work?

528
00:26:21.827 --> 00:26:24.758
- Yeah. kind of.
I mean. I presume you're happy?

529
00:26:24.862 --> 00:26:26.275
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Yeah?

530
00:26:26.379 --> 00:26:27.517
- There you go.

531
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.206
If I was upset. they'd both
be able to tell. for one.

532
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.379
And. like. they just won't pry.

533
00:26:32.482 --> 00:26:34.448
Like. if I say. "I'm fine."
they know that's just it.

534
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:36.068
I'm fine. they don't need to
ask questions.

535
00:26:36.172 --> 00:26:37.620
So they're both very supportive.

536
00:26:37.724 --> 00:26:39.379
And I've fucked her over
millions of times.

537
00:26:39.482 --> 00:26:40.448
- So many times.

538
00:26:40.551 --> 00:26:42.000
- I've been so horrible to her
in the past.

539
00:26:42.103 --> 00:26:44.034
- I think a lot of people
in your life have. like.

540
00:26:44.137 --> 00:26:46.586
come against a struggle
or something that's difficult

541
00:26:46.689 --> 00:26:48.931
about your friendship and just
cut you off. and just been.

542
00:26:49.034 --> 00:26:50.620
like. "Do you know what?
I don't need it."

543
00:26:50.724 --> 00:26:53.103
- Are you saying that
a friendship with Ashleigh

544
00:26:53.206 --> 00:26:55.034
comes with a certain amount
of drama?

545
00:26:55.137 --> 00:26:56.379
- Ashleigh: Yeah.
- [laughter]

546
00:26:56.482 --> 00:26:58.379
- Hell. yeah. Hell. yeah.
- That's putting it lightly.

547
00:26:58.482 --> 00:27:00.241
- No. no. that's. like.
that's a teaspoon.

548
00:27:00.344 --> 00:27:02.965
Oh. some person in one of my
other friendship groups

549
00:27:03.068 --> 00:27:04.172
that I'm friends with

550
00:27:04.275 --> 00:27:06.379
has decided to book me
for his birthday.

551
00:27:06.482 --> 00:27:07.862
so I'm gonna have sex with.

552
00:27:07.965 --> 00:27:09.793
like. one of my friends
for his birthday.

553
00:27:09.896 --> 00:27:12.620
- It sounds potentially
quite confusing.

554
00:27:12.724 --> 00:27:14.724
I would have thought. no?

555
00:27:14.827 --> 00:27:17.344
- What's confusing? [laughs]

556
00:27:17.448 --> 00:27:19.068
- [sighs] I don't know.

557
00:27:19.172 --> 00:27:20.862
- He's just my friend
who's gonna come round

558
00:27:20.965 --> 00:27:22.103
and have sex on his birthday.

559
00:27:22.206 --> 00:27:24.310
I'm offering a service.
he wants the service.

560
00:27:24.413 --> 00:27:27.172
and that's how it's going.
And nothing's gonna come of it.

561
00:27:27.275 --> 00:27:28.827
- It's actually better doing it
this way.

562
00:27:28.931 --> 00:27:32.551
because if there wasn't
an exchange happening.

563
00:27:32.655 --> 00:27:35.344
like. financially. then that
would be more confusing. surely?

564
00:27:35.448 --> 00:27:36.551
- Yeah.

565
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.965
- And then afterwards he'll
go back to being your friend?

566
00:27:39.068 --> 00:27:41.551
- Yeah.
- I guess that can work.

567
00:27:41.655 --> 00:27:42.896
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

568
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.241
- I mean. that's kind of what
our generation are like anyway.

569
00:27:45.344 --> 00:27:46.241
- Yeah.
- Really?

570
00:27:46.344 --> 00:27:49.275
- If you look in
many friendship groups.

571
00:27:49.379 --> 00:27:51.172
most people have had sex
with each other.

572
00:27:51.275 --> 00:27:53.241
Not every friendship group.
like. definitely.

573
00:27:53.344 --> 00:27:54.482
- Yeah. it's what happens.

574
00:27:54.586 --> 00:27:57.000
- But I think sex now.
even compared to.

575
00:27:57.103 --> 00:28:01.448
like. 20 years ago.
is just so liberal.

576
00:28:01.551 --> 00:28:02.862
Like. just. like...

577
00:28:02.965 --> 00:28:05.620
And. like. quite meaningless
to a lot of people.

578
00:28:05.724 --> 00:28:09.413
Dating apps have come
almost to fill the need

579
00:28:09.517 --> 00:28:13.586
of how we have sex
with each other in these days.

580
00:28:13.689 --> 00:28:15.862
- How long do you think
you're gonna do it for?

581
00:28:15.965 --> 00:28:19.413
- I can't see myself in the
future having a real job.

582
00:28:19.517 --> 00:28:21.482
A real job?
I mean. like. a 9-to-5

583
00:28:21.586 --> 00:28:23.413
is what I mean
when I say "real job."

584
00:28:23.517 --> 00:28:26.068
Like. standard as a 9-to-5.

585
00:28:26.172 --> 00:28:28.758
Just because of. like. my head.

586
00:28:28.862 --> 00:28:31.448
If I was making enough money
from just doing art stuff.

587
00:28:31.551 --> 00:28:34.896
then. fab. but. like. I'm fine
working like everyone else.

588
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.793
to get my money
to pay for things.

589
00:28:36.896 --> 00:28:38.896
I don't expect it
to be given to me.

590
00:28:40.068 --> 00:28:43.965
- That's good. isn't it?
[laughs]

591
00:28:44.068 --> 00:28:46.137
- Louis: It was reassuring
to see Ashleigh in the midst

592
00:28:46.241 --> 00:28:48.827
of a caring peer group.

593
00:28:48.931 --> 00:28:51.655
I was struck by their view
that sex was something that

594
00:28:51.758 --> 00:28:55.448
could be freely traded between
acquaintances and strangers

595
00:28:55.551 --> 00:28:57.724
without consequences.

596
00:28:57.827 --> 00:29:00.241
though I also had the impression
of them wanting to make

597
00:29:00.344 --> 00:29:02.344
a show of support for a friend

598
00:29:02.448 --> 00:29:04.655
they viewed
as a little bit vulnerable.

599
00:29:12.655 --> 00:29:14.758
For those who are close to
someone selling sex.

600
00:29:14.862 --> 00:29:17.689
I could only imagine there
must be a balance between.

601
00:29:17.793 --> 00:29:20.482
on the one hand.
respecting their choice.

602
00:29:20.586 --> 00:29:23.379
and on the other. wanting to
save them from a lifestyle

603
00:29:23.482 --> 00:29:26.931
many still view as damaging.

604
00:29:27.034 --> 00:29:30.620
And for those in a committed
relationship. even more so.

605
00:29:32.241 --> 00:29:35.172
In West Sussex. I was back with
Caroline and Graham.

606
00:29:36.344 --> 00:29:39.413
- Is that alright for you.
Louis? [speaks French]

607
00:29:39.517 --> 00:29:41.379
- Merci beaucoup.

608
00:29:41.482 --> 00:29:43.068
- [speaks French]
[laughs]

609
00:29:43.172 --> 00:29:45.793
- Mmm!
- I've no idea what that meant.

610
00:29:45.896 --> 00:29:47.482
- What time is
the client coming?

611
00:29:47.586 --> 00:29:49.517
- He's coming at ten.

612
00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:52.655
- What can you tell me
about him?

613
00:29:53.758 --> 00:29:57.275
- Nice guy. middle-aged.

614
00:29:57.379 --> 00:30:00.482
- Mm-hm. Meaning. 60? 50?

615
00:30:00.586 --> 00:30:03.206
- Fifties.
- Mm-hm. He's someone you...

616
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.482
- I've met him
quite a few times. yes.

617
00:30:05.586 --> 00:30:07.655
- He's a regular?
- He's a regular. Yeah.

618
00:30:07.758 --> 00:30:10.000
- So. this picture stays up.
does it?

619
00:30:10.103 --> 00:30:11.137
- Yeah. Yeah.

620
00:30:11.241 --> 00:30:13.758
- I mean. that could almost be
a bit off-putting. couldn't it?

621
00:30:13.862 --> 00:30:16.896
You are maybe paying for the
girlfriend experience...

622
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.931
- Mmm.

623
00:30:18.034 --> 00:30:21.000
- ..and then there's a picture
of a random guy...

624
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.517
with his hands on
your "girlfriend..."

625
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.586
- Yes.
- ..that you've paid for.

626
00:30:27.689 --> 00:30:29.034
- Yeah. well.
that's a good point. yeah.

627
00:30:29.137 --> 00:30:30.448
- But then there's
the other side.

628
00:30:30.551 --> 00:30:32.862
You make no secret of the fact
that you're married.

629
00:30:32.965 --> 00:30:35.862
- No. I don't make any secret
of the fact that I'm married.

630
00:30:35.965 --> 00:30:38.137
- You mentioned. I think.
that you do...

631
00:30:38.241 --> 00:30:39.896
or at least sometimes.

632
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.827
you do enjoy having sex with
your clients...

633
00:30:42.931 --> 00:30:44.517
- Yes. I do.
- ..maybe. right?

634
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:49.034
- Because I think it's
an amazing job.

635
00:30:49.137 --> 00:30:51.931
if you like to call it that.
that I can have.

636
00:30:52.034 --> 00:30:55.241
to give so many men
so much pleasure.

637
00:30:57.344 --> 00:31:00.310
And I know that I do that.

638
00:31:00.413 --> 00:31:04.793
I make so many men happy.
and I love that.

639
00:31:06.689 --> 00:31:08.379
- And it makes you happy.
by the way.

640
00:31:08.482 --> 00:31:10.758
- And it makes me happy.
It makes me happy.

641
00:31:10.862 --> 00:31:13.689
Basically. for most of my life.

642
00:31:13.793 --> 00:31:17.344
I've not wanted to be in
the foreground at all.

643
00:31:17.448 --> 00:31:20.206
I've been like a snail
sort of in its shell.

644
00:31:21.586 --> 00:31:24.862
And I've always sort of
hidden behind Graham

645
00:31:24.965 --> 00:31:30.000
and I feel like it's my time

646
00:31:30.103 --> 00:31:36.034
to come out and be the person...
the real me.

647
00:31:36.137 --> 00:31:40.034
And I feel like. you know.
this sort of sexual freedom

648
00:31:40.137 --> 00:31:43.172
that I've moved into
is the real me.

649
00:31:43.275 --> 00:31:45.931
[solemn music]

650
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.793
- So. when I'm around.
I'll often do this.

651
00:32:00.103 --> 00:32:02.068
Well. I know the dress I like.

652
00:32:02.172 --> 00:32:05.103
From what you've told me about
him. he'll like that.

653
00:32:07.137 --> 00:32:08.689
- [sighs] I'm ready.

654
00:32:10.241 --> 00:32:14.344
Well. you have a great time.
Enjoy yourself.

655
00:32:17.517 --> 00:32:20.413
- Louis: With the client
en route. Graham and I left

656
00:32:20.517 --> 00:32:22.793
for a local pub
to give them some space.

657
00:32:24.344 --> 00:32:27.448
It would also be a chance to
talk to him about his marriage.

658
00:32:29.206 --> 00:32:33.896
When she became a little bit
emotional back at the house.

659
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.206
what was behind that?

660
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.931
- She was brought up to believe
that women should be seen...

661
00:32:39.034 --> 00:32:42.206
Well. probably not even seen.
Not seen and not heard.

662
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:43.758
And that was her upbringing.

663
00:32:43.862 --> 00:32:47.551
and she just carried it on
into her adult life.

664
00:32:47.655 --> 00:32:52.000
I knew. for example. sexually.
she was pretty...

665
00:32:52.103 --> 00:32:54.655
suppressed. to put it mildly.
so that was an issue.

666
00:32:54.758 --> 00:32:55.724
- Meaning what?

667
00:32:55.827 --> 00:32:57.551
- Well. she just didn't
want to have sex.

668
00:32:57.655 --> 00:32:59.241
- At all?
- No.

669
00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:01.310
So if I'd been different.
I would have probably been a guy

670
00:33:01.413 --> 00:33:02.896
who would go and see escorts.

671
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.655
So I kept on thinking. you know.
"How can I initiate her?

672
00:33:07.758 --> 00:33:10.965
"How can I...
Maybe she might change."

673
00:33:11.068 --> 00:33:14.206
I never dreamt that Caroline
would take it this far.

674
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.965
- Really?
- Oh. never.

675
00:33:16.068 --> 00:33:17.862
No. I didn't have
the end game in mind

676
00:33:17.965 --> 00:33:21.172
that the final part of this
for Caroline would be an escort.

677
00:33:21.275 --> 00:33:24.793
- It sounds as though having
sorta nudged her along the way.

678
00:33:24.896 --> 00:33:27.655
now she's taken off
like a rocket.

679
00:33:27.758 --> 00:33:31.896
and you're now in the position.
slightly paradoxically.

680
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.862
of being less certain
about where you are.

681
00:33:37.655 --> 00:33:38.689
- Yes.

682
00:33:38.793 --> 00:33:41.517
If we've had a row. or
if things haven't gone right.

683
00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:45.206
or if I feel that
I haven't been thought of

684
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.103
or considered
in some way or another.

685
00:33:48.206 --> 00:33:52.310
then I can feel something
negative coming out of me.

686
00:33:52.413 --> 00:33:55.793
I can feel maybe a bit jealous
or a bit irritated.

687
00:33:57.103 --> 00:33:58.482
- About what?

688
00:33:58.586 --> 00:34:01.172
- What she's doing sometimes.
- Having sex with another guy?

689
00:34:01.275 --> 00:34:03.275
- Yeah. We'd have these
great big flare-ups.

690
00:34:03.379 --> 00:34:06.344
but. of course. then so I would
threaten with. you know.

691
00:34:06.448 --> 00:34:08.448
that it'd be the end of our
sexually free lifestyle.

692
00:34:08.551 --> 00:34:10.034
end of everything.

693
00:34:10.137 --> 00:34:15.241
And then. of course.
four hours later we'll be fine.

694
00:34:16.655 --> 00:34:18.793
I want her to be absolutely
successful

695
00:34:18.896 --> 00:34:20.137
as a woman in her own right.

696
00:34:20.241 --> 00:34:22.448
'cause she's never been
in her own right.

697
00:34:22.551 --> 00:34:25.655
I want her to be happy
and have pleasure.

698
00:34:25.758 --> 00:34:30.586
I really do. you know.
in every way. not just sexually.

699
00:34:34.206 --> 00:34:35.655
[solemn music]

700
00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.586
- Graham: Ooh. hello. gorgeous!
- Mm-hm!

701
00:34:40.689 --> 00:34:42.931
- How are you?
- Mmm. good. [laughs]

702
00:34:43.034 --> 00:34:46.275
- How was it?
- Yeah. great. thank you. yeah.

703
00:34:46.379 --> 00:34:49.137
Great time.
Would you like a glass of that?

704
00:34:49.241 --> 00:34:51.172
- Well. sure.
I'll have a little one. Why not?

705
00:34:51.275 --> 00:34:54.172
- Yeah. So. it was good. was it?
- Mmm.

706
00:34:54.275 --> 00:34:56.758
- Good? Very good?
Spectacular? Awful?

707
00:34:56.862 --> 00:34:57.931
Professional job?

708
00:34:58.034 --> 00:34:59.793
- No. no. it wasn't
a professional job.

709
00:34:59.896 --> 00:35:04.482
It was a good time.
It was...enjoyable.

710
00:35:04.586 --> 00:35:06.103
- Mmm.

711
00:35:09.068 --> 00:35:12.413
[solemn music]

712
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.206
- Louis: Several months
into filming.

713
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:21.758
and I was still conflicted about
the nature of the transaction

714
00:35:21.862 --> 00:35:23.862
at the heart of
the sexual economy.

715
00:35:25.137 --> 00:35:29.034
Whether it was a choice
freely made like any other

716
00:35:29.137 --> 00:35:31.724
or a symptom of a society
in which vulnerable women

717
00:35:31.827 --> 00:35:33.758
were traded and controlled.

718
00:35:33.862 --> 00:35:35.103
[camera clicks]

719
00:35:35.206 --> 00:35:37.620
- [sighs]
- That's better. I'm smiling.

720
00:35:39.379 --> 00:35:41.517
- Louis: In Nottingham.
Victoria had invited me

721
00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.344
to a porn shoot she'd organised.

722
00:35:43.448 --> 00:35:46.275
creating online content
to sell to fans and clients.

723
00:35:48.034 --> 00:35:49.896
- Victoria: OK?
- Man: Better.

724
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.103
- Louis: I can tell you're
doing a terrific job.

725
00:35:52.206 --> 00:35:53.275
- Man: Thank you. Louis.

726
00:35:53.379 --> 00:35:55.000
Now I'm gonna go for a medium.
then a close.

727
00:35:55.103 --> 00:35:57.206
- Louis: She'd told me of
a plan to do more porn

728
00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:00.172
and move away
from private bookings.

729
00:36:00.275 --> 00:36:02.379
- Man: Did you get that?
- [laughter]

730
00:36:02.482 --> 00:36:06.206
- You prefer the porn over
the escorting. don't you?

731
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:09.172
- Yeah. I don't have to be so
close and personal to people.

732
00:36:10.379 --> 00:36:12.620
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

733
00:36:12.724 --> 00:36:16.379
- Give less of yourself?
- Yeah. Yeah. definitely.

734
00:36:16.482 --> 00:36:19.172
- And I'm just wondering
whether. just in general.

735
00:36:19.275 --> 00:36:21.689
as a sensual experience.

736
00:36:21.793 --> 00:36:24.206
leaving the professionalism
to one side.

737
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.000
whether it's pleasurable?

738
00:36:26.103 --> 00:36:28.103
- Um... Yeah. it can be.

739
00:36:29.413 --> 00:36:30.724
- Just not today.

740
00:36:30.827 --> 00:36:32.931
- It can... No. [sighs]
- [laughs]

741
00:36:33.034 --> 00:36:35.034
- It's so hard for me
to answer this question.

742
00:36:35.137 --> 00:36:37.586
because it's...

743
00:36:39.724 --> 00:36:42.206
Oh. it's sex.
I do it all day every day.

744
00:36:43.344 --> 00:36:46.344
[solemn music]

745
00:36:48.862 --> 00:36:52.689
- Loitering on set. I reflected
on the paradox of leveraging

746
00:36:52.793 --> 00:36:56.482
the after-effects of trauma
into financial opportunity.

747
00:36:57.896 --> 00:37:00.448
And whether it represented
a kind of power.

748
00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:02.275
or its opposite.

749
00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:09.344
[solemn music]

750
00:37:16.827 --> 00:37:19.620
The same new websites that have
induced some women

751
00:37:19.724 --> 00:37:21.344
to enter the sexual marketplace

752
00:37:21.448 --> 00:37:24.137
are also bringing that world
to clients who.

753
00:37:24.241 --> 00:37:27.000
in the past. might never
have thought of doing it.

754
00:37:28.724 --> 00:37:31.689
In Croydon. South London.
I was meeting Hugh.

755
00:37:31.793 --> 00:37:32.758
Hello!

756
00:37:32.862 --> 00:37:33.965
- Hi!
- How are you?

757
00:37:34.068 --> 00:37:35.793
- Great. thank you.
- Louis. Nice to meet you.

758
00:37:35.896 --> 00:37:37.758
At age 16.
Hugh had been diagnosed

759
00:37:37.862 --> 00:37:39.689
with muscular dystrophy.

760
00:37:39.793 --> 00:37:41.827
He lost his virginity at 30.

761
00:37:41.931 --> 00:37:45.206
But after that. his sexual
experiences had dwindled away.

762
00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.931
- Can I make you one?
- By all means. yes.

763
00:37:50.965 --> 00:37:52.620
- You don't have kids.
is that right?

764
00:37:52.724 --> 00:37:54.137
- No.
- Never been married?

765
00:37:54.241 --> 00:37:56.517
- Never been married. no.
- Not interested?

766
00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.896
- I know people say. "He'd never
met the right person."

767
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.551
but. yeah. I just never met
someone who would have me.

768
00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:07.655
[laughs] I mean. in the perfect
world. I've always wanted a...

769
00:38:09.448 --> 00:38:11.241
It seems unfair.
but I've always wanted

770
00:38:11.344 --> 00:38:13.000
an able-bodied girlfriend.

771
00:38:13.103 --> 00:38:16.586
or not so disabled
that she couldn't. well.

772
00:38:16.689 --> 00:38:18.344
get on top. essentially.
[laughs]

773
00:38:18.448 --> 00:38:21.137
[solemn music]

774
00:38:22.517 --> 00:38:24.034
- OK. Yeah.

775
00:38:24.137 --> 00:38:27.448
- Louis: Hugh had an
appointment that evening.

776
00:38:27.551 --> 00:38:29.965
A carer arrived
to get him ready.

777
00:38:32.482 --> 00:38:34.758
One year earlier.
Hugh had set up an account

778
00:38:34.862 --> 00:38:36.896
on the main sex industry
website.

779
00:38:40.517 --> 00:38:42.413
- How's it going in there?

780
00:38:42.517 --> 00:38:44.379
- Well. thank you. Yeah.

781
00:38:44.482 --> 00:38:46.586
- You like to look your best
for your date?

782
00:38:46.689 --> 00:38:51.655
- Yeah. [laughs]
Yes. my...my appointment.

783
00:38:51.758 --> 00:38:55.620
- How many women have you seen
since you started?

784
00:38:55.724 --> 00:39:01.896
- Nine. The eldest. 51.
youngest was about 21.

785
00:39:06.068 --> 00:39:08.482
- Was there a moment
or something that prompted you

786
00:39:08.586 --> 00:39:10.241
to take that step?

787
00:39:10.344 --> 00:39:15.034
- I think it was the realisation
I was getting to a certain age.

788
00:39:15.137 --> 00:39:19.448
and if I didn't do drastic
action I'd go to my grave...

789
00:39:19.551 --> 00:39:22.413
[laughs]
..never having sex again.

790
00:39:22.517 --> 00:39:23.793
- Mmm.

791
00:39:23.896 --> 00:39:28.689
Can you characterise for me
how much it's meant to you?

792
00:39:28.793 --> 00:39:31.620
- I mean. it's pleasurable.
It's expensive.

793
00:39:31.724 --> 00:39:33.931
It doesn't ruin my life.

794
00:39:34.034 --> 00:39:35.758
I'd rather have a girlfriend...

795
00:39:37.655 --> 00:39:41.620
but it just hasn't worked out
for me for whatever reason.

796
00:39:41.724 --> 00:39:45.689
be that my disability.
be that my winning personality.

797
00:39:45.793 --> 00:39:48.137
I don't know. [laughs]

798
00:39:50.482 --> 00:39:52.448
I think a lot of women...

799
00:39:54.103 --> 00:39:57.344
understandably see me

800
00:39:57.448 --> 00:40:01.482
and put me in the
"too complicated" category.

801
00:40:03.275 --> 00:40:06.448
- Hugh was seeing someone
he'd booked twice before.

802
00:40:06.551 --> 00:40:10.310
a woman selling sex
to supplement her income.

803
00:40:10.413 --> 00:40:13.241
Would you say you've got to know
each other a little bit?

804
00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:16.172
- I enjoy her company very much.

805
00:40:16.275 --> 00:40:18.275
- But you have to be realistic.
don't you...

806
00:40:18.379 --> 00:40:19.344
- Yeah. Exactly

807
00:40:19.448 --> 00:40:21.551
- About what's actually
taking place?

808
00:40:21.655 --> 00:40:23.310
- Exactly.
- Which is what?

809
00:40:25.172 --> 00:40:26.310
- Which is what?

810
00:40:26.413 --> 00:40:32.068
We're enjoying each other's
company in exchange for money.

811
00:40:33.241 --> 00:40:37.413
I think I would be less happy

812
00:40:37.517 --> 00:40:40.379
if I hadn't explored
this avenue.

813
00:40:42.344 --> 00:40:47.620
That. probably. well.
I feel better for it. yes.

814
00:40:47.724 --> 00:40:49.344
- Mmm.

815
00:40:49.448 --> 00:40:52.448
- There's a little bit of guilt.
[laughs softly]

816
00:40:52.551 --> 00:40:57.517
I suppose paying for it was an
admission of failure on my part.

817
00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:01.206
[solemn music]

818
00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:04.137
- I wasn't sure how to judge
Hugh's choice.

819
00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.172
I was conscious of how much
I didn't know

820
00:41:07.275 --> 00:41:10.103
about the young woman's story.

821
00:41:10.206 --> 00:41:13.931
At the same time. his desire for
a life made a little more full

822
00:41:14.034 --> 00:41:15.896
by the ability to buy sex

823
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.931
seemed completely
understandable.

824
00:41:19.034 --> 00:41:21.344
[solemn music]

825
00:41:28.103 --> 00:41:30.379
In my time among women
selling sex.

826
00:41:30.482 --> 00:41:31.758
the only one for whom the work

827
00:41:31.862 --> 00:41:35.344
was not mainly motivated
by money was Caroline.

828
00:41:36.965 --> 00:41:39.413
Caroline had also been
the only one to say clearly

829
00:41:39.517 --> 00:41:41.517
she enjoyed sex with clients.

830
00:41:42.482 --> 00:41:44.413
Hello!

831
00:41:44.517 --> 00:41:46.379
Gonna find my friends
downstairs.

832
00:41:48.344 --> 00:41:50.827
- Nice to see you.
- Hi! Mmm! You. too.

833
00:41:50.931 --> 00:41:53.689
- But even with all the time
we'd spent together.

834
00:41:53.793 --> 00:41:56.103
there were aspects
of her relationship with Graham

835
00:41:56.206 --> 00:41:58.034
I didn't really understand.

836
00:41:58.137 --> 00:42:01.172
Hoping to find out more.
I was meeting them again.

837
00:42:01.275 --> 00:42:03.965
- Something I wanted
to show you. [laughs]

838
00:42:04.068 --> 00:42:05.310
- Go on.

839
00:42:06.517 --> 00:42:08.793
- 'Hot Wives'.
- Yeah. you've got two there.

840
00:42:08.896 --> 00:42:11.724
- And who have we got here?
She looks familiar.

841
00:42:11.827 --> 00:42:13.586
- [laughs]
- That's you.

842
00:42:13.689 --> 00:42:15.103
- Yeah.
They put me on the cover.

843
00:42:15.206 --> 00:42:16.482
- That's nice. isn't it?

844
00:42:16.586 --> 00:42:18.827
- [laughs] Yeah.
So I'm quite proud of that.

845
00:42:20.965 --> 00:42:24.206
I thought that I could wear
one of these.

846
00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:25.827
I like that idea.

847
00:42:25.931 --> 00:42:27.758
Or there's this one. as well.
look.

848
00:42:27.862 --> 00:42:29.793
and got a zip down the front.

849
00:42:32.689 --> 00:42:34.482
- Louis: How's it going between
the two of you?

850
00:42:34.586 --> 00:42:36.517
- Up and down.

851
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.206
- Are you in a good place?

852
00:42:40.137 --> 00:42:43.551
- Yes and no. It depends what
time of the day you catch me.

853
00:42:43.655 --> 00:42:46.758
- But. I mean. how much of any
of this is to do with

854
00:42:46.862 --> 00:42:50.000
either insecurity
or mixed feelings

855
00:42:50.103 --> 00:42:54.310
or jealousy
around Caroline's work?

856
00:42:54.413 --> 00:42:58.655
- Do you know. generally.
I don't think it's that.

857
00:42:58.758 --> 00:43:04.206
The best way I can say it.
for me. is that...

858
00:43:06.034 --> 00:43:07.862
To be continued.

859
00:43:10.241 --> 00:43:11.827
- Louis: Uh-oh!
- [Graham laughs]

860
00:43:11.931 --> 00:43:13.241
- Police!

861
00:43:13.344 --> 00:43:15.724
- Now. we always need to do
the feel test.

862
00:43:15.827 --> 00:43:17.448
- It's an important part.
- Yeah.

863
00:43:17.551 --> 00:43:19.172
- So...
- What do you think?

864
00:43:19.275 --> 00:43:20.793
- Do you like the feel?
- Oh. I like that.

865
00:43:20.896 --> 00:43:23.344
- It's nice and smooth.
- I'll have a walk around.

866
00:43:25.068 --> 00:43:26.862
- You look...gorgeous!

867
00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.034
- Yeah. I like it.
- Great. OK.

868
00:43:30.137 --> 00:43:31.206
- We'll get this.

869
00:43:35.344 --> 00:43:37.241
- I think I've probably spent
half my life

870
00:43:37.344 --> 00:43:38.758
standing outside changing rooms.

871
00:43:38.862 --> 00:43:41.482
- What were you gonna say.
before we were interrupted?

872
00:43:41.586 --> 00:43:44.586
- I want more attention
from her.

873
00:43:44.689 --> 00:43:47.655
I would just like to spend
more intimate

874
00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:49.862
communication time
with Caroline.

875
00:43:49.965 --> 00:43:51.620
And that's something
I didn't think through.

876
00:43:51.724 --> 00:43:53.482
It started to develop inside me.

877
00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:58.172
[solemn music]

878
00:44:04.275 --> 00:44:05.931
- Louis: At a nearby
coffee shop.

879
00:44:06.034 --> 00:44:07.413
the conversation moved on

880
00:44:07.517 --> 00:44:09.896
to the subject of Caroline's
childhood.

881
00:44:11.206 --> 00:44:15.724
- My upbringing was
quite Victorian.

882
00:44:15.827 --> 00:44:17.793
but also mixed with religion.

883
00:44:17.896 --> 00:44:21.379
as I was brought up to believe
that sex was dirty.

884
00:44:21.482 --> 00:44:23.172
it was wrong.

885
00:44:23.275 --> 00:44:28.034
I went into our marriage with.
I think. the same attitude.

886
00:44:28.137 --> 00:44:31.034
- And you feel that having led
this life.

887
00:44:31.137 --> 00:44:33.275
or certainly had this
upbringing.

888
00:44:33.379 --> 00:44:35.448
where men were dictating
what you should do...

889
00:44:35.551 --> 00:44:36.517
- Yeah.

890
00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.448
- ..you feel that now.
this is very different?

891
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:39.482
- Yeah.

892
00:44:39.586 --> 00:44:42.482
- You are calling the shots.
deciding what you want to do.

893
00:44:42.586 --> 00:44:44.448
- Graham: Absolutely.
- Yes. Yeah.

894
00:44:44.551 --> 00:44:50.758
It's been a process over the
last few years particularly.

895
00:44:50.862 --> 00:44:54.896
that I've really been
discovering who I am

896
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.586
and what I want and need.

897
00:44:57.689 --> 00:45:00.344
And the experience I've had
with other men

898
00:45:00.448 --> 00:45:05.103
helps me have a better sex life
with Graham.

899
00:45:05.206 --> 00:45:09.241
- You're quite happy with
your sex life with Caroline?

900
00:45:09.344 --> 00:45:12.758
- She's everything I think.
I want and dream of.

901
00:45:14.068 --> 00:45:17.931
Which is not something I would
have said a few years ago.

902
00:45:18.034 --> 00:45:19.620
- Mmm.

903
00:45:19.724 --> 00:45:21.620
- Forgive me for pushing
a certain idea.

904
00:45:21.724 --> 00:45:23.241
and I just want to
get it out there.

905
00:45:23.344 --> 00:45:25.655
but do you think there's a sense
in which. you know.

906
00:45:25.758 --> 00:45:29.241
this was a sort of fantasy
that you had?

907
00:45:29.344 --> 00:45:33.551
- I'm surprised
as anybody could be

908
00:45:33.655 --> 00:45:36.862
as to where we've landed up
and where Caroline's landed up.

909
00:45:36.965 --> 00:45:42.655
- Being an escort was entirely
my choice. and Graham never.

910
00:45:42.758 --> 00:45:46.896
at any point. told me I needed
to be. or anything like that.

911
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.344
- I'm proud of her
and I think it's amazing.

912
00:45:49.448 --> 00:45:50.965
and I constantly want to be sure

913
00:45:51.068 --> 00:45:53.310
that she's doing
what she wants to do. though.

914
00:45:53.413 --> 00:45:54.517
- Mmm.

915
00:45:56.103 --> 00:45:58.517
- I worry far more about that
than maybe you know.

916
00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.689
- Yeah.
- Do you really want to do this?

917
00:46:00.793 --> 00:46:03.241
- Yeah. Well. some days I don't.

918
00:46:03.344 --> 00:46:05.068
Some days I wake up and I think.

919
00:46:05.172 --> 00:46:08.448
"Oh. I don't really feel like
doing that today."

920
00:46:08.551 --> 00:46:10.068
- [Graham laughs]

921
00:46:10.172 --> 00:46:13.448
- But then. at the same time.
I think.

922
00:46:13.551 --> 00:46:15.586
"Well. you know.

923
00:46:15.689 --> 00:46:20.827
"I want to be committed to
doing a good job...

924
00:46:21.931 --> 00:46:25.413
"and I don't have anything
else to do.

925
00:46:25.517 --> 00:46:27.310
"so. you know. I'll do it."

926
00:46:27.413 --> 00:46:28.793
[both laugh]

927
00:46:28.896 --> 00:46:31.724
But then. in the process
of that. I'll enjoy it.

928
00:46:31.827 --> 00:46:34.344
so then I'll get into it.

929
00:46:34.448 --> 00:46:36.862
[solemn music]

930
00:46:39.172 --> 00:46:40.896
- Louis: It was incongruous.

931
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.689
but Caroline seemed to have
gained a sense of self

932
00:46:43.793 --> 00:46:46.827
from embracing a role
as a sexual commodity.

933
00:46:48.724 --> 00:46:52.241
Controlled in her childhood.
and now finding satisfaction

934
00:46:52.344 --> 00:46:56.655
fulfilling the desires of men
on terms that were more her own.

935
00:47:01.896 --> 00:47:05.586
Graham. for his part. seemed
happy to endure some insecurity

936
00:47:05.689 --> 00:47:08.931
as the price of a more sexually
adventurous marriage.

937
00:47:12.137 --> 00:47:14.206
[solemn music]

938
00:47:16.241 --> 00:47:20.379
In a way. Caroline's age
and maturity were reassuring.

939
00:47:20.482 --> 00:47:22.137
It was with those who were
younger

940
00:47:22.241 --> 00:47:25.275
that I found myself tempted to
take a more protective attitude.

941
00:47:26.862 --> 00:47:29.137
At a pub near her flat
in South West London.

942
00:47:29.241 --> 00:47:30.551
I was meeting Ashleigh.

943
00:47:30.655 --> 00:47:33.344
- Louis! Louis!
- Hello!

944
00:47:33.448 --> 00:47:35.413
- Hello! How are you?
- Good. How are you?

945
00:47:35.517 --> 00:47:37.413
- I'm OK. Sorry. I'm a bit
sweaty. 'cause I'm. like...

946
00:47:37.517 --> 00:47:38.931
- You've changed your hair
again!

947
00:47:39.034 --> 00:47:41.034
- I know! But I look great.
- Wow! Nice to see you.

948
00:47:41.137 --> 00:47:42.724
- Nice to see you. How are you?
- Good.

949
00:47:42.827 --> 00:47:44.068
- Good!
- Let's go inside.

950
00:47:44.172 --> 00:47:45.931
- Did you have a haircut?
- Yes. I'm afraid so.

951
00:47:46.034 --> 00:47:47.275
- Looks great.

952
00:47:51.172 --> 00:47:52.862
- You know I asked you
to bring some photos?

953
00:47:52.965 --> 00:47:54.103
- Yeah. I brought
my baby photos.

954
00:47:54.206 --> 00:47:55.620
- Did you bring them?

955
00:47:57.413 --> 00:47:58.413
Oh. so cute!

956
00:47:58.517 --> 00:48:01.103
- I know! I'm so cute.
[laughs]

957
00:48:01.206 --> 00:48:03.172
- Your parents were very young
when they had you.

958
00:48:03.275 --> 00:48:05.379
- Yeah. So. I think my mum
got pregnant at 15.

959
00:48:05.482 --> 00:48:06.413
- Really?

960
00:48:06.517 --> 00:48:08.586
But. I mean. it wasn't like
your dad was much older. though?

961
00:48:08.689 --> 00:48:10.758
- No. I think my dad was 16.

962
00:48:10.862 --> 00:48:12.931
- So that's your dad?
- That's my dad. Uh-huh.

963
00:48:13.034 --> 00:48:15.068
- He looks like a child himself.
Yeah.

964
00:48:15.172 --> 00:48:17.413
- 1995. my dude.
- Was it '95?

965
00:48:17.517 --> 00:48:19.379
- That's when I was born.
But they were children.

966
00:48:19.482 --> 00:48:21.275
- But they didn't stay together
that long. is that right?

967
00:48:21.379 --> 00:48:23.137
- Yeah. They stayed together
till I was about 3 or 4.

968
00:48:23.241 --> 00:48:24.827
- I think?
- So. three or four years.

969
00:48:24.931 --> 00:48:27.896
- Yeah. I don't ever remember
them being together.

970
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.896
He wasn't the kindest man
when I was growing up.

971
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.172
or the most supportive.

972
00:48:34.275 --> 00:48:36.896
and I've tried so hard to form
a relationship with my dad.

973
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.482
like. so hard.
for so many years.

974
00:48:39.586 --> 00:48:42.344
and I'm not doing it anymore.
I've given up.

975
00:48:42.448 --> 00:48:44.620
'cause it's heartbreaking...
[laughs]

976
00:48:44.724 --> 00:48:46.379
..to try.
do you know what I mean?

977
00:48:46.482 --> 00:48:50.172
- It's almost a cliché of women
involved in sex work

978
00:48:50.275 --> 00:48:55.034
that they have complicated
or strained relationships.

979
00:48:55.137 --> 00:48:57.586
- With their father. I don't
know if it is completely.

980
00:48:57.689 --> 00:48:59.448
I can only speak for myself.

981
00:48:59.551 --> 00:49:03.068
I'm so desperate for people to.
like. not even like me. just.

982
00:49:03.172 --> 00:49:05.344
like. acknowledge my existence.

983
00:49:05.448 --> 00:49:08.931
and I think that I only see
my existence as a sum of my.

984
00:49:09.034 --> 00:49:12.517
like...the pleasure that I can
give other people.

985
00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.793
No-one wants to be around me
just for who I am.

986
00:49:14.896 --> 00:49:17.344
People want to be around me
for what I can give to them.

987
00:49:17.448 --> 00:49:20.172
and. like. for most men.
what I can give to them is sex.

988
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.689
Between the ages of 6 to 12.

989
00:49:23.793 --> 00:49:25.896
I was sexually abused by someone
that was really close to me.

990
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.103
so I think that I'm just
very hypersexualised

991
00:49:29.206 --> 00:49:30.344
because of that.

992
00:49:30.448 --> 00:49:32.827
and I just value a lot of my.
like...

993
00:49:32.931 --> 00:49:34.655
That was the time
that I felt wanted.

994
00:49:34.758 --> 00:49:37.206
because they didn't care
about me otherwise.

995
00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:39.482
[laughs]

996
00:49:39.586 --> 00:49:41.724
Oh. it was really rough.

997
00:49:41.827 --> 00:49:43.758
It was really. really.
really rough.

998
00:49:43.862 --> 00:49:45.517
And then when he stopped.

999
00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:48.034
I basically just assumed
that he hated me.

1000
00:49:48.137 --> 00:49:50.586
Does that make sense?
So then. when he stopped.

1001
00:49:50.689 --> 00:49:54.379
it just made everything worse.
basically.

1002
00:49:54.482 --> 00:49:55.655
Sorry.

1003
00:49:56.758 --> 00:49:59.034
But I'm over it. I think.

1004
00:50:01.379 --> 00:50:04.000
I say that as I cry.
I'm over it. it's fine.

1005
00:50:04.103 --> 00:50:05.931
Like. it happens. Shit happens.

1006
00:50:06.034 --> 00:50:07.724
You just have to try and turn
that into something

1007
00:50:07.827 --> 00:50:10.758
that you can make yourself
a better person with.

1008
00:50:10.862 --> 00:50:12.896
so I'm using that experience
to not let myself

1009
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.172
be in situations where I'm gonna
feel vulnerable

1010
00:50:15.275 --> 00:50:19.482
and feel like my self-worth
is down to my sexual actions.

1011
00:50:19.586 --> 00:50:21.000
Does that make sense?

1012
00:50:22.482 --> 00:50:24.344
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. I'm honestly fine.

1013
00:50:24.448 --> 00:50:26.379
- OK.
- I'm just a big crier. sorry.

1014
00:50:26.482 --> 00:50:28.137
[laughs]

1015
00:50:28.241 --> 00:50:31.000
- What occurs to me is that
you've got a lot going on...

1016
00:50:31.103 --> 00:50:33.206
- Mmm.
- ..inside your head.

1017
00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:35.344
I've heard you say
more than once

1018
00:50:35.448 --> 00:50:40.551
that you don't appreciate
a sort of saviour mentality.

1019
00:50:40.655 --> 00:50:41.724
- No.

1020
00:50:41.827 --> 00:50:43.379
- And I think I respect you
too much...

1021
00:50:43.482 --> 00:50:44.448
- [laughs]

1022
00:50:44.551 --> 00:50:46.689
- ..to presume to judge
your choices. right?

1023
00:50:46.793 --> 00:50:47.724
- Yeah.

1024
00:50:47.827 --> 00:50:49.275
- But at the same time.
I'm also aware

1025
00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:51.137
that with everything going on.

1026
00:50:51.241 --> 00:50:53.413
it's actually screaming out.
isn't it. the fact...

1027
00:50:53.517 --> 00:50:54.586
- Yeah. Look. that's true.

1028
00:50:54.689 --> 00:50:56.344
- ..that you've embraced
a kind of work

1029
00:50:56.448 --> 00:51:01.379
that involves a lot of emotional
and physical self-exposure.

1030
00:51:01.482 --> 00:51:02.689
- Yeah. 100%.
- Right?

1031
00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:04.241
And you must have thought
about that a lot?

1032
00:51:04.344 --> 00:51:05.241
- Definitely.

1033
00:51:05.344 --> 00:51:06.896
And I think that because
I was just so used to it.

1034
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.620
I don't see it as a big deal.
because I...

1035
00:51:08.724 --> 00:51:10.517
- Right. Which doesn't
necessarily mean

1036
00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.724
- it isn't a big deal.
- Yeah. exactly.

1037
00:51:12.827 --> 00:51:15.655
- Is there part of you
that's wondering whether...

1038
00:51:18.103 --> 00:51:19.482
it's the right kind of work?

1039
00:51:19.586 --> 00:51:21.448
- No. I'm fine with the work.

1040
00:51:21.551 --> 00:51:23.758
I think it gives you. like.
a numbness.

1041
00:51:23.862 --> 00:51:25.448
- But I think...
A sort of "numbness."

1042
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:27.689
OK. that's a good way
of putting it.

1043
00:51:27.793 --> 00:51:29.931
- It's just. like. I always say
this to my mum. like.

1044
00:51:30.034 --> 00:51:31.862
"I don't like sex.
I like affection."

1045
00:51:31.965 --> 00:51:33.758
and you get affection from sex.

1046
00:51:33.862 --> 00:51:36.620
and I seem to think that that's
the only way I'm gonna get it.

1047
00:51:36.724 --> 00:51:38.517
so I'm. like. trapped in this.

1048
00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:40.275
But I don't think
that I'm gonna get affection

1049
00:51:40.379 --> 00:51:41.965
from these men on Adult Work.

1050
00:51:42.068 --> 00:51:44.931
I know for a fact that it's.
like. not sustainable.

1051
00:51:45.034 --> 00:51:48.103
and I know that that's not gonna
cure me.

1052
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.413
I'm cute. aren't I? I'm so fat.

1053
00:51:52.517 --> 00:51:54.586
Look at my cheeks. [laughs]

1054
00:51:54.689 --> 00:51:56.862
[solemn music]

1055
00:51:59.517 --> 00:52:02.586
It seemed clear Ashleigh was
drawn to selling sex

1056
00:52:02.689 --> 00:52:05.172
at least in part
because of a background of abuse

1057
00:52:05.275 --> 00:52:06.724
and ill treatment.

1058
00:52:08.068 --> 00:52:10.689
How her new life would
contribute to her recovery

1059
00:52:10.793 --> 00:52:13.206
I found almost impossible
to know.

1060
00:52:20.034 --> 00:52:22.517
More than ever. I was struck by
the difficult position

1061
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.482
of many of those selling sex.

1062
00:52:24.586 --> 00:52:27.827
taking part in an economy
viewed by some as immoral

1063
00:52:27.931 --> 00:52:30.413
and others as coerced
and unhealthy...

1064
00:52:31.206 --> 00:52:33.896
feeling judged on both sides.

1065
00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:38.793
But I was also troubled by
the question of whether

1066
00:52:38.896 --> 00:52:41.000
they were being completely open
with me

1067
00:52:41.103 --> 00:52:42.724
about the cost of what they did.

1068
00:52:47.551 --> 00:52:49.758
Back in Nottingham
for one last visit.

1069
00:52:49.862 --> 00:52:53.379
I was with Victoria and Sapphire
on an outing to the nail salon.

1070
00:52:56.827 --> 00:52:58.413
- Victoria: Mmm.
what shall I have?

1071
00:52:58.517 --> 00:53:00.310
- Have a blue sorta thing.
- I don't like blue.

1072
00:53:00.413 --> 00:53:02.206
- I like blue.
It looks nice on you.

1073
00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:05.310
Oh. not silver.
'cause you always get silver.

1074
00:53:05.413 --> 00:53:07.758
- Right.
- I'll have to get pink.

1075
00:53:08.862 --> 00:53:13.689
- I love pink-silver
on my glitter. [laughs]

1076
00:53:14.965 --> 00:53:17.413
- But I think the two of you
are quite close. aren't you?

1077
00:53:17.517 --> 00:53:19.758
- Yeah.
- Yeah. we're very close.

1078
00:53:19.862 --> 00:53:21.000
- Yeah.

1079
00:53:22.344 --> 00:53:24.724
But she's still at that age now
where...

1080
00:53:26.344 --> 00:53:27.862
she's got her own little life.

1081
00:53:27.965 --> 00:53:30.103
and she wants to go out with
her friends. as well.

1082
00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:33.344
- Mmm. Do you think. having had
the experiences you had

1083
00:53:33.448 --> 00:53:36.896
growing up. that that's made you
more careful as a mum?

1084
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.517
- Oh. God. yeah. Definitely.

1085
00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:42.551
[laughs] Sapphire will tell you.
I've put trackers on her phone

1086
00:53:42.655 --> 00:53:43.931
and everything. haven't I?

1087
00:53:44.034 --> 00:53:45.862
- You're very protective.

1088
00:53:45.965 --> 00:53:47.344
But that's a good thing.

1089
00:53:47.448 --> 00:53:49.103
I know I've complained about it
a lot.

1090
00:53:49.206 --> 00:53:51.034
but it is a good thing really.
isn't it?

1091
00:53:51.137 --> 00:53:52.551
- It is. yeah.

1092
00:53:52.655 --> 00:53:54.862
- In an alternate reality.

1093
00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:57.000
if Sapphire was sort of
a different person

1094
00:53:57.103 --> 00:54:01.482
and wanted to pursue work
like you do. adult work.

1095
00:54:01.586 --> 00:54:03.344
what would be your view?

1096
00:54:03.448 --> 00:54:05.620
- No. I wouldn't want that
at all. you know?

1097
00:54:05.724 --> 00:54:07.275
No. of course I wouldn't.

1098
00:54:07.379 --> 00:54:09.344
It's just the judgement
around it.

1099
00:54:09.448 --> 00:54:12.275
especially when everybody else
is questioning you and saying.

1100
00:54:12.379 --> 00:54:15.655
you know. stuff about you.
you...

1101
00:54:15.758 --> 00:54:17.586
then you're battling with
yourself. thinking.

1102
00:54:17.689 --> 00:54:19.862
"Am I doing the right thing?
Am I not?" You know?

1103
00:54:21.034 --> 00:54:22.827
I think that's why girls
don't last long

1104
00:54:22.931 --> 00:54:25.000
in this industry. as well.

1105
00:54:25.103 --> 00:54:27.379
I guess it's a whole stigma.

1106
00:54:29.793 --> 00:54:33.206
- [laughs] Bye-bye!
[laughs] See ya!

1107
00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:34.448
- Bye!

1108
00:54:35.896 --> 00:54:37.137
Oh!

1109
00:54:41.068 --> 00:54:44.586
- Louis: Driving back. I thought
about Victoria's choices.

1110
00:54:44.689 --> 00:54:47.551
For all the difficulty
they'd created in her life.

1111
00:54:47.655 --> 00:54:50.344
it was also true that they'd
allowed her to give her children

1112
00:54:50.448 --> 00:54:53.241
an upbringing very different
from the one she'd had.

1113
00:54:59.724 --> 00:55:03.862
- Hello!
- Oh. thank you! See ya!

1114
00:55:06.793 --> 00:55:09.034
Look what we got!

1115
00:55:09.137 --> 00:55:12.586
Wait! Don't all grab.
Don't be rude.

1116
00:55:12.689 --> 00:55:14.586
I'm gonna put 'em on a plate
for you.

1117
00:55:14.689 --> 00:55:15.896
- [kid laughs]

1118
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.620
- Louis: They bring you
a dipping sauce. as well.

1119
00:55:17.724 --> 00:55:19.310
That's quite handy. isn't it?

1120
00:55:20.724 --> 00:55:22.724
- Come on. let's go get you
in bed. Shoes off.

1121
00:55:23.793 --> 00:55:25.758
Come on then. do your teeth.

1122
00:55:27.482 --> 00:55:29.344
Do you want a book?

1123
00:55:29.448 --> 00:55:34.068
"Paw Patrol pups love spending
time playing outdoors."

1124
00:55:34.724 --> 00:55:36.482
- Louis: Goodnight!

1125
00:55:39.896 --> 00:55:42.758
With the kids in bed. it was a
chance to speak more candidly.

1126
00:55:44.586 --> 00:55:46.896
- You'd talked about getting
out of escorting...

1127
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:47.931
- Yeah.

1128
00:55:48.034 --> 00:55:51.344
- ..and just doing adult film
and appearances.

1129
00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:52.724
- things like that.
- Yeah.

1130
00:55:52.827 --> 00:55:54.689
- Are you winding it down?

1131
00:55:56.620 --> 00:56:00.034
- I'm being a lot more picky.
yeah. Definitely.

1132
00:56:00.137 --> 00:56:03.655
Even. to be honest. on certain
shoots and stuff like that.

1133
00:56:03.758 --> 00:56:06.068
I've just said. "No.
I'm not doing that anymore.

1134
00:56:06.172 --> 00:56:07.275
"I don't need to do that."

1135
00:56:07.379 --> 00:56:10.448
I'm spreading myself too thinly.
I'm just wearing myself out.

1136
00:56:10.551 --> 00:56:12.724
- And doing this sorta work
doesn't make you...

1137
00:56:13.862 --> 00:56:16.275
feel anything against men?

1138
00:56:16.379 --> 00:56:18.206
Men are just...

1139
00:56:19.586 --> 00:56:21.172
[laughs] Well...

1140
00:56:21.275 --> 00:56:24.689
I always refer to 'em as very
simple creatures. pretty much.

1141
00:56:24.793 --> 00:56:26.551
They're not complex like us.

1142
00:56:26.655 --> 00:56:28.827
They're not.
You know. they're very simple.

1143
00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:34.068
The majority of men
are not nice. [laughs]

1144
00:56:34.172 --> 00:56:37.965
There's a big percentage that.
you know.

1145
00:56:38.068 --> 00:56:40.275
I don't agree with.
I don't think are nice.

1146
00:56:40.379 --> 00:56:41.862
I don't think respectable.

1147
00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:43.310
- And what are you basing
that on?

1148
00:56:43.413 --> 00:56:45.655
The fact that the way men
have treated you

1149
00:56:45.758 --> 00:56:48.689
in your personal life.
or the way your clients are?

1150
00:56:48.793 --> 00:56:50.931
- Or both?
- Both.

1151
00:56:51.034 --> 00:56:56.862
I think it takes a lot for me
to be able to. I don't know...

1152
00:56:56.965 --> 00:56:59.724
trust a man or whatever.

1153
00:56:59.827 --> 00:57:02.896
- When we were talking before.
there was this question of.

1154
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.275
can it be healthy sort of
psychologically. I suppose.

1155
00:57:06.379 --> 00:57:09.275
What I hear from you is that.
actually.

1156
00:57:09.379 --> 00:57:14.137
doing sex work
is emotionally complicated.

1157
00:57:14.241 --> 00:57:16.758
- Yeah. [sighs]

1158
00:57:16.862 --> 00:57:20.793
I mean. ideally. I'd love
a normal relationship. you know?

1159
00:57:20.896 --> 00:57:23.655
But. I mean. the situation
I'm in at the minute...

1160
00:57:25.068 --> 00:57:27.896
[sighs]

1161
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.413
..is just a relationship with me
and the children.

1162
00:57:30.517 --> 00:57:32.068
do you know what I mean?

1163
00:57:33.862 --> 00:57:38.206
But. obviously. I don't wanna
be like this forever.

1164
00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:40.034
[sighs]

1165
00:57:40.862 --> 00:57:42.241
[footsteps]

1166
00:57:43.379 --> 00:57:45.931
One of the kids is up.
[laughs]

1167
00:57:46.034 --> 00:57:48.000
Let me go and ask him
to settle down.

1168
00:57:48.103 --> 00:57:51.068
[solemn music]

1169
00:57:51.172 --> 00:57:53.172
- Louis: Whether because of
prejudice

1170
00:57:53.275 --> 00:57:55.931
or the unique nature
of physical intimacy.

1171
00:57:56.034 --> 00:57:58.206
we have for centuries
tended to judge those

1172
00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:00.206
who trade sex for money.

1173
00:58:02.655 --> 00:58:05.793
My time among those working
in the new sexual economy

1174
00:58:05.896 --> 00:58:09.551
had shown me women escaping
lives of repression and abuse.

1175
00:58:09.655 --> 00:58:13.275
who believed they were using
trauma to empower themselves.

1176
00:58:15.137 --> 00:58:17.689
With some. I'd worried about
the possibility

1177
00:58:17.793 --> 00:58:20.172
of making vulnerabilities worse.

1178
00:58:21.551 --> 00:58:24.000
But it was also true
that for at least one.

1179
00:58:24.103 --> 00:58:26.034
faced with few other options.

1180
00:58:26.137 --> 00:58:29.137
it had made a precarious
position more manageable

1181
00:58:29.241 --> 00:58:31.379
for her and her family.

1182
00:58:31.482 --> 00:58:34.482
