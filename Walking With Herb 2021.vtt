00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:16.451
Do you think I should

- I don't know!
- Yeah!

5
00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:21.832
I didn't get mine pierced
until I was 14. I think?

6

Yeah. I think that's right.

7

Yes. she's grandma's little angel.

8
00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:27.713
Right? Grandma's little angel.

9
00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.923
- She sleeps so well.
- She does.

10
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.676
Just share that with everybody.

11
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.679
Let me get my phone

15
00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:48.275
- Still a tiny. tiny. thing.
- I'll take a selfie.

16
00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.402
Whose nose do you think she has?

17
00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:54.239
- Yours.
- I think it might be Omar's.

18
00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:56.992
Grandpa.

19
00:01:57.618 --> 00:01:58.619
It's me.

20
00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:01.371
Look at this. Look. look. look.

21
00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:04.583
She always grabs my finger.
No matter what she does.

22
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.085
Is that your happy face?
She likes to grab your finger.

23
00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.880
She loves it.
She just holds my hand.

24
00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.424
Look at this. look at this.
She won't let go!

25
00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:15.636
- So funny!
- We're in a good family!

26
00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:18.263

that one of these little ones
should perish."

39
00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:54.216
Then why is she in the box?

40
00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.802
Where was our father
when she got sick?

- "The lord is my Shepherd."
- "The lord is my Shepherd."

44
00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.153

Who kills innocent healers and children?

49
00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:31.962
Daddy. We have to have faith.

50
00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.964
I have no faith.

51
00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:26.934
Breakfast!

52
00:04:36.527 --> 00:04:39.738
Sheila tranquinila.
how does your garden grow?

53
00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:43.742
Well. the rabbits seem to be enjoying it.

54
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:47.621
I'll pick up some meshed wire.

55
00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.165
Hmm. That's what you said last summer.

56
00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:51.583
Well. last summer I lied.

57
00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:53.919
This summer. I promise.

58
00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.638
I really do need that wire mesh.

59
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:08.183
That ladies home and garden contest
is fast approaching.

60
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.652
How do I help you?

61
00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:27.244
Ask whozit. your eternal love lord.

62
00:05:28.412 --> 00:05:30.914
You know. if you make fun
of my faith one more time.

63
00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:33.166
I'm going to stop speaking to you.

64
00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.546
Let me think about that.

65
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.550
I'd better get to work.

66
00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.552
That's a really good idea.

67
00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.596
You are getting on my last nerve.

68
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:08.619
Be ready to forgive again and again...

69
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.041
And again. Amen.

70
00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:05.008
Oh. god.

71
00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:10.138
Good morning. Mr. Amable-amo.

72

Disturb me at will. Karen.

74
00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:21.400

77
00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.155
Hi. daddy.

78
00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.199
Hi.

79
00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:32.619
- Hey. hey. hey. hey!
- Thanks for seeing me.

80
00:07:32.703 --> 00:07:34.788
Oh. please.
As if I wouldn't see my baby.

81
00:07:35.831 --> 00:07:38.625
How are you. huh? Sit down.

82
00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:42.129
- A little situation.
- Oh.

83
00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:47.968
The pipes in the school's bathroom burst
and flooded the kitchen!

84
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.804
- I'm really sorry. baby.
- Yeah. well.

85
00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:54.892
Uh. can you run an after-school program
if you're not actually open after school?

86
00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.645
How much is it gonna cost to fix?

87
00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.399
Um. just $5.000.

88
00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:04.902
But I'm already three months late

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:06.695
on my mortgage payment. daddy.
I'm so...

90
00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:10.073
I see. Your mom and I could help.

00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:12.659
No. you already do so much.

92
00:08:12.743 --> 00:08:16.830
We can do more.

93
00:08:16.914 --> 00:08:20.626
Hey. Daniel. Hey. Bruce.

Oh. daddy.

Come on. baby. That's okay.

96
00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:27.382
That's me. Best job ever.

97
00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:29.176
Oh. I love you.

Hi. Of course. Hi.

104
00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:01.500
Words are worthless to say anything
meaningful about your losses. so I'll...

105
00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:05.420
So I'll stop trying to use 'em. Words.

106
00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:07.214
I know.

107
00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.717
Okay. I love you. daddy. Bye.

108
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:13.762
Um. you know. your dad told me
about the work that you do.

109
00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:16.890
If you ever need a mountain biker

00:09:16.974 --> 00:09:19.142

ukulele player...

111

Where'd you come from? Huh?

116
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.178
Well. some very inclusive person
is missing you.

117
00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:57.306
Come here. little belly.
Come here. little belly.

118
00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:00.100
Oh. that's a little belly boy.
Wanna get some water?

119
00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.651
Anything else

120
00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:14.156
Yes. I want the bank to do more.

121

Well. your daughter's
gonna miss another payment.

126
00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:28.587
The thing is. the examiner
isn't gonna care.

127
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.380
He's gonna foreclose.
And we are a bank.

128
00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:33.217
Oh. really? Gee! Since when?

129
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.904
The thing is. they will shut you down.
if you don't follow the rules.

130
00:10:35.928 --> 00:10:38.347
- When's our criminal defense due?
- Two days.

131
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.141
Okay. Well. let's get ready

Shave all your body hair.

133

Okay. okay.

134
00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.776
Fist bump? Good talk.

135
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:12.130
Oh. boy.

136
00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:19.513
"Joe. it's god. I have chosen you
for a special mission.

137
00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:22.057
I could have done
the whole burning bush thing.

138
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.726
but all the plants in your office
are artificial."

139

Um. very funny!

140
00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:33.777
Yeah. Thank you.

141

143
00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:49.293
Oh. It's a bad idea.

144
00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:52.421
Whoever hacked my computer.
uh. no need to confess.

145
00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:53.922
Please. just UN-hack it.

146
00:11:54.006 --> 00:11:58.051
And. uh. thank you all

All right. Whoever this is.
you want a playmate? Here you go.

149
00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:14.610
"Hey there. god.
About time I heard from you.

150
00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:17.613
Let's meet for lunch to discuss..."

151
00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:21.033
Oh!

152
00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:25.913
"Resist the sarcasm. Joe.

153
00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:29.208
Rather. behold and believe!"

154

155
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:34.379
Yes. sir. Problem?

156

There's someone that's trying...

157
00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:41.845
Ah. what?

158
00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:43.096
What?

159
00:12:44.056 --> 00:12:45.057
Thanks. Karen.

160

Hey. Gabe!

165
00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.208
Are you in control of all of this?

166
00:13:13.502 --> 00:13:14.502
Oh!

167
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:21.218
Oh! I'll call the copy machine people.

168
00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:24.721
It's okay. It's just being innovative.

169
00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:29.560
First American bank examination report?

Go give that to Joe.

176
00:13:49.246 --> 00:13:50.956
Good boy!

177
00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:52.082
Good boy!

178
00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:55.294
<i>You have reached
Sheila amable-amo.</i>

179
00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.045
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

180
00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:07.556
Hi.

181
00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.308
What have you got?

182
00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:13.770
Huh? What's this?

183
00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:23.405
"Sometimes we forget to remember
what we have known all of our lives."

184
00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:25.157
Such as the power of faith

185
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.576
to fill us with the power
to change our lives.

186
00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:31.163
"In an instant of revelation."

187
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:39.505
Do you have to travel to the revelation
or can I stay in the air conditioning?

188
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:47.095
Well. you know. honey. I've always
enjoyed the fact you're a little nuts.

189
00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:49.014
It's part of your charm.

190
00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:52.059
So. uh...

191
00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:53.977
- What's the mission?
- Yes.

192
00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:59.066
It's so ludicrous
that you're gonna say what I did.

193
00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:02.611
How could god.
given all the strife in the world.

194
00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.279
care about such a mission?

195
00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:09.034
Wouldn't. couldn't. so doesn't.

196
00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:13.914
Okay. So. the mission is
three. two. one...

197
00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:19.294
Win the golf championship
of the world entire.

198
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.173
I told you!

199
00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.595
That is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard

200
00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:31.181
since probably the last
most ridiculous thing!

201
00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:37.104
Ah!

202
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:42.609
I don't know if this is relevant.

203
00:15:42.693 --> 00:15:44.820
but there's a really big dove
on your head.

204
00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:47.072
- Is it pooping?
- No.

205
00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:49.950
It just winked at me.

206
00:15:53.662 --> 00:15:55.497
It did that to me too!

207
00:15:56.665 --> 00:16:01.420
Oh. Joseph. I haven't seen that smile
in such a long time.

208
00:16:04.298 --> 00:16:06.717
I'm not smiling. I'm grimacing.

209
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.637
No. <i>querido.</i> That's a smile.

210
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.308
I'm a little scared.

211
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:15.475
Me too.

212
00:16:17.728 --> 00:16:20.898
But I figure that's par for the course.

213
00:16:35.454 --> 00:16:38.040
We haven't had this much to drink. right?

214
00:16:38.874 --> 00:16:39.875
No.

215
00:16:40.918 --> 00:16:43.837
Can we agree that what just happened
just happened?

216
00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:49.384
What are we gonna do?

217
00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:56.725
Well. I could take you
to the mental hospital or...

218
00:17:00.479 --> 00:17:05.817
You could accept
that not a prankster. not a hacker.

219
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:11.573
but the almighty... chose you.

220
00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:15.160
And you could follow the instructions.

221
00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:20.582
You believe that this was...
Is an act of god?

222
00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:25.921
I not only believe.

223
00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:29.132
I am overjoyed

224
00:17:30.092 --> 00:17:34.096
that god has chosen Joseph amable-amo.

225
00:17:38.851 --> 00:17:40.978
And maybe it's no accident

226
00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:46.233
that your name means
what god needs you to be.

227
00:17:47.693 --> 00:17:51.280
Joe kind-love.

228
00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.574
But golf?

229
00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.474
I think you should go.

230
00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:24.146
All right.

231
00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.077
Are they kidding?

232
00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:49.296
Okay.

233
00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:55.093
Oh. wow.

234
00:18:55.886 --> 00:18:58.972
Could be someone's
a fabulous bird trainer...

235
00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:03.435
Or not.

236
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:07.064
Boy.

237
00:19:39.388 --> 00:19:40.389
Wow.

238
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.934
Could be set for a weird zombie movie...

239
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.236
Or not.

240
00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:57.281
Hey. it's you again.

241
00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:00.993
What have you got there?

242
00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:04.663
Hey! What's this? What's this?

243
00:20:09.418 --> 00:20:10.752
"Amable-amo Joseph.

244
00:20:10.836 --> 00:20:13.463
Kind-love Joe. hit some warm-up shots.

245
00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:15.883
Dog's name is sand wedge."

246
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.596
You Sandy or wedgie for short?

247
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.682
Ah. Sandy. of course.

248
00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:28.020
Wedgie would be a little risqué
for a divine operation like this.

249
00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:56.715
Aw. man!

250
00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:03.347
Phew!

251
00:21:28.205 --> 00:21:32.459
Not bad! For a stove-up
old banker.

252
00:21:32.543 --> 00:21:33.794
Herb.

253
00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:35.379
Joe amable-amo.

254
00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:38.549
I reckon the almighty lord
already told you about me. yeah?

255
00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:40.968
Almighty lord?

256
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:44.972
Almighty plus lord. a.L. Al...

257
00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:46.055
Whoa.

258
00:21:46.098 --> 00:21:48.725
Heck. well. you know.
I kind of figured. uh...

259
00:21:49.852 --> 00:21:53.689
I kind of figured we were on the brink
of getting updates from the beyond.

260
00:21:54.356 --> 00:21:56.608
Whoo. these are old. Yeah.

261
00:21:56.692 --> 00:21:59.653
While you were figuring out
what you needed to figure out

262
00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:01.697
to get you to show up here. yeah?

263
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.283
Well. that's interesting figuring. herb.

264
00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:07.911
Well. can't say I blame you
for having your doubts.

265
00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:10.205
About the almighty or my golf game?

266
00:22:10.289 --> 00:22:12.583
Well. I mean.
who could doubt the almighty?

267
00:22:12.666 --> 00:22:16.170
Me. I could. I have. I do.

268
00:22:16.253 --> 00:22:18.964
And I'm not up for this ludicrous mission.

269
00:22:19.047 --> 00:22:22.843
Unless you have a robotics person
who can give me back

270
00:22:22.926 --> 00:22:25.304
the body and game I had when I was 30.

271
00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:29.850
Well. my part in this mission is. Joe.

272
00:22:29.933 --> 00:22:32.978
I get you to trust and believe.

273
00:22:33.061 --> 00:22:36.690
And your part is to turn all of that
self-doubt right there into faith.

274
00:22:36.773 --> 00:22:38.400
Now how 'bout...

275
00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:40.360
How 'bout you hit me a ball?

276
00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:43.363
What if I say no?

277
00:22:43.447 --> 00:22:46.283
You say no.
I give you money for gas

278
00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:49.494
and you go back to the incredible
excitement of your current life in...

279
00:22:49.578 --> 00:22:51.163
I'm sorry. I don't mean to laugh.

280
00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:52.915
High finance!

281
00:22:55.334 --> 00:22:59.421
Trust in a higher purpose
than you figured was your highest purpose.

282
00:23:00.506 --> 00:23:02.257
Lots of things are possible. Joe.

283
00:23:04.343 --> 00:23:05.719
I'd love to cooperate.

284
00:23:06.845 --> 00:23:10.641
but when my daughter
lost her husband and child.

285
00:23:10.724 --> 00:23:13.268
and what she continues
to sacrifice her life for.

286
00:23:13.352 --> 00:23:16.563
a non-profit school for homeless kids.

287
00:23:16.647 --> 00:23:17.940
That's my...

288
00:23:19.358 --> 00:23:23.612
She and those kids. I mean...

289
00:23:25.864 --> 00:23:28.450
Well. then. heck. Joe!
I mean. cash in then!

290
00:23:28.534 --> 00:23:29.785
Cash it in!

291
00:23:30.536 --> 00:23:34.248
I don't know if you or mighty al know.

292
00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:39.169
but amateurs can't receive cash prizes.

293
00:23:40.796 --> 00:23:42.297
I'm thinking endorsements.

294
00:23:42.381 --> 00:23:44.550
Endorsements?

295
00:23:46.426 --> 00:23:49.054
Senile-guy swim diapers.

296
00:23:51.723 --> 00:23:54.226
Stair lifts with built-in bedpans.

297
00:23:54.643 --> 00:23:56.770
They don't have those. do they?

298
00:23:57.396 --> 00:23:59.731
Talking stool softeners.

299
00:24:03.819 --> 00:24:05.195
That is funny!

300
00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:06.405
I haven't seen those.

301
00:24:07.364 --> 00:24:10.659
Walk-in bathtub with...

302
00:24:11.243 --> 00:24:12.578
Salad bar.

303
00:24:12.661 --> 00:24:14.538
And more! You know. sponge cake!

304
00:24:14.621 --> 00:24:15.914
Sponge cake.

305
00:24:17.165 --> 00:24:18.792
They've never had
a spokesperson.

306
00:24:19.793 --> 00:24:21.044
Sponge cake.

307
00:24:21.128 --> 00:24:24.464
Thirty-five years is too long.

308
00:24:35.851 --> 00:24:37.269
Ah!

309
00:24:39.563 --> 00:24:41.231
<i>Oh. it was just like that movie.</i>

310
00:24:41.815 --> 00:24:43.609
You know. <i>close encounters
of the third kind.</i>

311
00:24:43.692 --> 00:24:45.694
The light was on me.
And it wasn't for a long time.

312
00:24:45.777 --> 00:24:48.822
but it was on me and it was weird.

313
00:24:48.906 --> 00:24:52.451
I don't know. Some kind
of atmospheric anomaly. I don't know.

314
00:24:54.077 --> 00:24:57.122
Maybe what you thought
was an atmospheric anomaly

315
00:24:57.206 --> 00:24:59.374
was really a message from god.

316
00:25:04.379 --> 00:25:07.382
Or maybe it was an atmospheric anomaly.

317
00:25:07.466 --> 00:25:12.638
Joseph... no one. no one thing

318
00:25:12.721 --> 00:25:15.641
can force you back
to the faith you once had.

319
00:25:17.851 --> 00:25:21.021
I'm gonna change my concept
to what a day is.

320
00:25:21.104 --> 00:25:24.691
Hmm. I'm interested
in how you're gonna do that.

321
00:25:26.443 --> 00:25:29.446
Go to bed at 9:00. and wake up at 4:00.

322
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:30.906
Theory being?

323
00:25:31.949 --> 00:25:35.536
A two-hour head start
on the rest of the world every day.

324
00:25:36.286 --> 00:25:39.873
Hmm. Maybe a way to hit 200 golf balls

325
00:25:39.957 --> 00:25:42.543
and run a bank and spend
enough time with your wife

326
00:25:42.626 --> 00:25:44.461
that she doesn't abandon you.

327
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.631
Until further notice.

328
00:25:47.714 --> 00:25:50.843
I'll be coming in at 6:00
and leaving at 3:00.

329
00:25:50.926 --> 00:25:52.177
Thank you.

330
00:25:56.348 --> 00:25:58.809
Thanks for helping me
with this office.

331
00:25:58.892 --> 00:26:00.811
Hey. boss. Love the new hours.

332
00:26:00.894 --> 00:26:04.064
For me. not for you. Gabe.

333
00:26:04.147 --> 00:26:06.441
Knew it. Uh. oh. and great job
on those two reports.

334
00:26:06.525 --> 00:26:08.461
Looked them over. First time
I didn't make any mistakes.

335
00:26:08.485 --> 00:26:12.489
Oh. and also. I set up the exit interview
with the examiner for Friday at 11:00.

336
00:26:12.573 --> 00:26:14.700
Looking forward to that like a root canal.

337
00:26:14.783 --> 00:26:17.619
Oh. no. you should try a root canal.
You know what? My mom had one

338
00:26:17.703 --> 00:26:19.514
and she said that it was really
like a twilight sleep...

339
00:26:19.538 --> 00:26:20.914
- Gabe?
- Yep?

340
00:26:20.998 --> 00:26:24.793
If Audrey and I wanted
to start riding a bike.

341
00:26:24.877 --> 00:26:29.214
what would you suggest we do first

342
00:26:29.298 --> 00:26:32.301
after. say. buying the bike?

343
00:26:33.552 --> 00:26:34.553
Pedal?

344
00:26:37.514 --> 00:26:41.226
Now. Give these babies a try.

345
00:26:42.644 --> 00:26:47.149
Okay? Thing I taught nicklaus
was. slow down at the top.

346
00:26:47.232 --> 00:26:49.484
Finish your backswing
before starting your downswing.

347
00:26:49.568 --> 00:26:51.212
It worked pretty good
for old Jackson. huh?

348
00:26:51.236 --> 00:26:52.654
You taught Jack nicklaus.

349
00:26:52.738 --> 00:26:54.656
One lesson. all it took.

350
00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.909
Here. hit this.

351
00:26:56.992 --> 00:27:00.662
All the way back. all the way through.
Think ballet.

352
00:27:01.246 --> 00:27:04.875
Right? So that club you got right there.
I call it Joe's slice hotch.

353
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:06.877
and this one right here
is your hook hotch.

354
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.046
Now. jojo. hit me a nice fade.

355
00:27:11.798 --> 00:27:13.217
Sponge cake!

356
00:27:14.176 --> 00:27:15.761
- Wow!
- Beautiful!

357
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.936
- How 'bout a cold one?
- Absolutely!

358
00:27:24.561 --> 00:27:27.189
Hey. Sandy. How old are you?
Around 14?

359
00:27:27.272 --> 00:27:29.441
Pretty close.
Fourteen hundred. closer.

360
00:27:30.817 --> 00:27:34.404
Ooh. boy. My idea of a cold one's
are beer-related. What's this?

361
00:27:34.488 --> 00:27:38.450
- Ha! That's my special herb's herb tea.
- Hmm.

362
00:27:38.534 --> 00:27:40.285
Huh? Say that ten times fast. But not now.

363
00:27:40.369 --> 00:27:42.849
Do it on your own time
'cause you've got golf balls to collect.

364
00:27:43.288 --> 00:27:46.625
Ah. you and your daddy boy
were real close. yeah?

365
00:27:47.668 --> 00:27:50.254
He was my hero.

366
00:27:51.213 --> 00:27:55.300
Hard worker. strong faith.
stronger values.

367
00:27:57.052 --> 00:27:58.470
Best golfer in town.

368
00:27:59.263 --> 00:28:03.225
When I graduated from high school.
I was offered a full-ride scholarship.

369
00:28:03.308 --> 00:28:07.312
College all-American.
Satellite tour. And then. uh...

370
00:28:08.021 --> 00:28:09.523
What? I don't recall.

371
00:28:10.148 --> 00:28:13.986
Oh. yeah. Then life kind of got in the way
of kind-love Joe's dreams. huh?

372
00:28:14.528 --> 00:28:17.114
Yeah. Isn't there something
in the Bible about

373
00:28:17.197 --> 00:28:18.907
god passing out new bodies?

374
00:28:18.991 --> 00:28:21.076
Yeah. romans 8.

375
00:28:21.743 --> 00:28:25.080
But in romans 5. it says.
"we rejoice in our suffering.

376
00:28:25.163 --> 00:28:27.291
because we know what suffering brings."
What is that?

377
00:28:27.374 --> 00:28:30.794
Massive resentment of god's inability

378
00:28:30.878 --> 00:28:33.172
to resist destroying innocent lives.

379
00:28:33.255 --> 00:28:36.008
I was gonna say perseverance.
but all right.

380
00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:37.259
I gotta go.

381
00:28:37.342 --> 00:28:40.053
Okay. well. go to your king James Bible
in your living room. Joe.

382
00:28:40.137 --> 00:28:43.057
If you have faith the size of a tiny
mustard seed. you can move mountains.

383
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.725
I'm a mustard fan.

384
00:29:17.466 --> 00:29:20.594
You've heard the expression.
"drive for show and putt for dough"?

385
00:29:21.637 --> 00:29:24.765
About 60.812 times.

386
00:29:24.848 --> 00:29:27.768
You're a good listener. I'm gonna show you
my foolproof method

387
00:29:27.851 --> 00:29:30.354
for making every putt inside of ten feet.

388
00:29:30.437 --> 00:29:31.897
Foolproof? Right.

389
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.566
I don't know anything
that a human can't screw up.

390
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:38.278
All right. I want you to grip the putter
firmly in your hands. Joe.

391
00:29:38.362 --> 00:29:40.531
Put the putter in the lifeline
of each hand.

392
00:29:41.114 --> 00:29:43.909
Good. Now. Put your elbows
against your side.

393
00:29:43.992 --> 00:29:46.828
No hand. arm or wrist movement.

394
00:29:46.912 --> 00:29:49.998
I want you to "visualate" the ball
going into the hole.

395
00:29:56.672 --> 00:30:01.677
Hmm. So much for. uh. foolproof.

396
00:30:03.053 --> 00:30:04.471
- Bad "visualating."
- Okay.

397
00:30:04.555 --> 00:30:06.265
I want you to move the putter back. Joe.

398
00:30:06.348 --> 00:30:09.434
by rockin' the weight
off of your left instep

399
00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:12.271
and then back onto the left instep.

400
00:30:12.354 --> 00:30:15.691
So you're rockin' back.
rockin' back to your left foot.

401
00:30:15.774 --> 00:30:17.025
Okay? There's 50 balls here.

402
00:30:18.193 --> 00:30:19.444
Fifty?

403
00:30:19.528 --> 00:30:21.196
When you make all 50.
you can go home.

404
00:30:23.156 --> 00:30:27.327
And remember. faith is the belief
in the right to believe in yourself.

405
00:30:28.078 --> 00:30:30.956
I know. Joe.

406
00:30:33.292 --> 00:30:34.626
Baby faith. huh?

407
00:30:36.879 --> 00:30:38.046
Putt.

408
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.895
You got 49 more to go. Joe.
And you can go home.

409
00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:06.366
I was hungry at dinner time.

410
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.911
Eat. I got this.

411
00:31:10.329 --> 00:31:12.039
So how was it?

412
00:31:13.707 --> 00:31:15.375
I sort of loved it.

413
00:31:15.459 --> 00:31:17.294
- Yeah.
- Really?

414
00:31:18.003 --> 00:31:19.505
You did?

415
00:31:22.216 --> 00:31:23.217
Tell me!

416
00:31:26.386 --> 00:31:29.598
It's fantastic. It felt really good.

417
00:31:31.016 --> 00:31:32.809
But we have a problem.

418
00:31:34.144 --> 00:31:36.021
Bank examiners
are coming in tomorrow.

419
00:31:36.813 --> 00:31:39.733
They're gonna want me to foreclose
on our daughter's school.

420
00:31:44.988 --> 00:31:47.032
And you're not properly prepared

421
00:31:47.115 --> 00:31:49.451
because you've been
tempted back to your faith

422
00:31:49.535 --> 00:31:51.286
that god will provide?

423
00:31:54.206 --> 00:31:58.126
Stuck on my faith that I have no clue
what god will provide.

424
00:31:59.211 --> 00:32:04.049
as the last offerings were
several people dead in our family.

425
00:32:08.971 --> 00:32:09.972
Well...

426
00:32:13.308 --> 00:32:16.645
Audrey's mortgage isn't gonna be an issue.

427
00:32:18.146 --> 00:32:20.858
- Tell me.
- Okay.

428
00:32:21.525 --> 00:32:23.277
Pay off Audrey's mortgage.

429
00:32:25.153 --> 00:32:27.447
With what? My stamp collection?

430
00:32:28.031 --> 00:32:32.661
Honey. All those...
Those big payday speeches

431
00:32:32.744 --> 00:32:35.747
and autograph-signings
at those retirement homes

432
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:40.169
after you win the championship
of the world entire.

433
00:32:40.252 --> 00:32:42.045
You really believe that?

434
00:32:42.129 --> 00:32:46.216
No. But I'm practicing pretending.

435
00:32:47.092 --> 00:32:50.429
- Here.
- Wait. Herb says that...

436
00:32:50.512 --> 00:32:52.514
Oh. herb says.

437
00:32:54.183 --> 00:32:55.517
Oh. Come here.

438
00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:03.650
Now. let's just forget about
what herb says for tonight. okay?

439
00:33:04.443 --> 00:33:05.861
Because we have the right.

440
00:33:06.612 --> 00:33:07.613
Hmm.

441
00:33:09.364 --> 00:33:11.033
We have the obligation.

442
00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:17.915
We have the desire.

443
00:33:17.998 --> 00:33:20.417
Your individual deposit accounts
are impressive.

444
00:33:20.501 --> 00:33:23.045
Your loan portfolio
to small local businesses.

445
00:33:23.128 --> 00:33:26.381
especially minorities
and first-time home buyers. admirable.

446
00:33:26.465 --> 00:33:28.509
Your collections
are persistent and effective.

447
00:33:28.592 --> 00:33:29.885
with the exception of one.

448
00:33:29.968 --> 00:33:34.097
Uh. a loan to
jardin del sol primary school

449
00:33:34.181 --> 00:33:36.326
that's four months in arrears.
Why haven't you foreclosed?

450
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.310
That's a really important group in town.

451
00:33:38.393 --> 00:33:40.896
They feed and educate
poor and homeless children.

452
00:33:40.979 --> 00:33:42.564
Compassion is laudable.

453
00:33:42.648 --> 00:33:44.568
but it is not a hallmark
of the banking business.

454
00:33:44.608 --> 00:33:47.110
Sorry I'm late. Couldn't find
the right thing to wear.

455
00:33:47.194 --> 00:33:48.904
Joe. Gabe. Mrs. Perkins.

456
00:33:48.987 --> 00:33:52.241
I am the incoming president
of Mr. Amable-amo's board.

457
00:33:52.324 --> 00:33:54.660
My name is Herbert barreth.
phd philosophy.

458
00:33:54.743 --> 00:33:56.537
physical education. arborist... whoa!

459
00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.664
I love that little Buddhist thingy.

460
00:33:58.747 --> 00:34:00.467
One of my favorite thinkers.
gautama Buddha.

461
00:34:00.541 --> 00:34:02.042
What's that other one? Don't tell me.

462
00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:04.103
- I won't tell you. Mr. Barreth.
- Uh. Dr. Barreth.

463
00:34:04.127 --> 00:34:05.796
Doctor. Because I have no idea...

464
00:34:05.879 --> 00:34:07.381
You have no idea what's going on.

465
00:34:07.464 --> 00:34:12.219
But whatever's going on can be fixed up
inside "eleventeen" days.

466
00:34:12.302 --> 00:34:14.388
Eleventeen? I'm sorry. I don't...

467
00:34:14.471 --> 00:34:16.723
That is a banking term
of where I hail from.

468
00:34:16.806 --> 00:34:19.016
- And where's that. mister...
- Uh. doctor.

469
00:34:19.101 --> 00:34:23.105
That is over yonder.
the last star that you see before dawn.

470
00:34:24.438 --> 00:34:26.400
She wants $300.000 in arrears.

471
00:34:26.483 --> 00:34:29.820
Okay. Mr. Amable-amo will be going
on two fundraising trips.

472
00:34:29.902 --> 00:34:32.406
and when he returns
from the second trip in may.

473
00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:34.408
back payments. in full.

474
00:34:34.491 --> 00:34:36.702
It's only April 25th.
I'm afraid I can't poss...

475
00:34:36.784 --> 00:34:38.161
Don't be afraid that you can't.

476
00:34:38.245 --> 00:34:40.722
You remember what the Buddha said?
And if you don't. I'll remind you.

477
00:34:40.746 --> 00:34:44.042
"Death is not to be feared
by someone who has lived wisely."

478
00:34:44.126 --> 00:34:48.088
Wow! So. be brave. Mrs. Perkins.
and trust that you can do the right thing.

479
00:34:48.172 --> 00:34:51.300
even though it appears
increasingly unpopular.

480
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.183
It's your funeral. fellas.

481
00:35:00.058 --> 00:35:03.478
Funerals don't exactly terrify me anymore.
Mrs. Perkins.

482
00:35:03.562 --> 00:35:05.981
For the record. you haven't heard
the last of this.

483
00:35:06.064 --> 00:35:09.484
Where I come from.
we never hear the last of anything.

484
00:35:09.568 --> 00:35:10.944
I think she's mad.

485
00:35:12.446 --> 00:35:14.382
- Yeah. okay. that was. uh...
- It was. wasn't it?

486
00:35:14.406 --> 00:35:15.490
Uh-huh. I have a question.

487
00:35:15.574 --> 00:35:17.010
I'm sure you do. Ask the boss.
I gotta go.

488
00:35:17.034 --> 00:35:18.577
Two trips in may?

489
00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.078
Yes. Think about it.

490
00:35:21.622 --> 00:35:25.375
The world entire
open sectional qualifier.

491
00:35:25.459 --> 00:35:27.961
I gotta finish in the top two in the...

492
00:35:28.587 --> 00:35:30.047
Oh. my god!

493
00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.257
Yes. exactly. Oh-your-god.

494
00:35:32.341 --> 00:35:34.176
Nothing to fear. Joe.

495
00:35:34.259 --> 00:35:35.761
Except fear itself. right?

496
00:35:35.844 --> 00:35:40.015
No. There is nothing to fear
except the burdens of success.

497
00:35:40.098 --> 00:35:41.099
Right. Gabe?

498
00:35:41.183 --> 00:35:43.852
I'm behind whatever you say.
Just get me the bumper stickers.

499
00:35:43.936 --> 00:35:45.812
Uh. don't suck up.
It's not appealing on you.

500
00:35:45.896 --> 00:35:46.939
Okay. sir.

501
00:35:47.022 --> 00:35:48.941
Tomorrow morning. Joe.
I want you to meet me

502
00:35:49.024 --> 00:35:51.026
at the artesia country club
bright and early.

503
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:52.402
- 8:00 A.M.
- why?

504
00:35:52.486 --> 00:35:54.404
Don't ask why.

505
00:35:54.488 --> 00:35:55.989
Oh. and wear something nice.

506
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.680
Supposed to clear up in two hours.
47 minutes and 63 seconds.

507
00:36:22.432 --> 00:36:24.017
Aha! Mrs. Amable-amo!

508
00:36:24.101 --> 00:36:25.477
I know you.

509
00:36:25.561 --> 00:36:27.813
Does anybody really know anyone.
Mrs. Amable-amo?

510
00:36:27.896 --> 00:36:30.607
Something told me
to come along today.

511
00:36:30.691 --> 00:36:33.360
I only sent you that message
once telepathically.

512
00:36:33.443 --> 00:36:36.029
When I was picking up
the wire mesh yesterday.

513
00:36:36.113 --> 00:36:37.990
Very good. Mrs. Amable-amo.

514
00:36:38.073 --> 00:36:39.575
Are you allowed to call me Sheila?

515
00:36:39.658 --> 00:36:42.536
Only you can stop me. Sheila.
Come on. Joe.

516
00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:46.039
Some golfers
have personal trainers. huh?

517
00:36:46.123 --> 00:36:48.876
They don't use horse liniment anymore
like when you played last.

518
00:36:48.959 --> 00:36:50.961
- Sheila! Joe!
- Hi.

519
00:36:51.044 --> 00:36:53.046
Coming in to finish the sign up. Dave.

520
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.798
You haven't played in years.

521
00:36:54.882 --> 00:36:56.425
Thirty-five to be exact.

522
00:36:57.384 --> 00:36:58.552
You don't have a handicap.

523
00:36:58.635 --> 00:37:02.222
Exactly. Dave. That's why he needs
to play in the club championship.

524
00:37:02.306 --> 00:37:06.810
so he can establish a handicap low enough
to enter a world entire qualifier.

525
00:37:06.894 --> 00:37:08.395
A world entire qualifier.

526
00:37:08.478 --> 00:37:09.730
She just said that.

527
00:37:09.813 --> 00:37:11.899
- And you are?
- I'm herb.

528
00:37:12.441 --> 00:37:14.985
Director of personal hygiene and hijinks.

529
00:37:15.068 --> 00:37:17.112
- I had to make you the lowest seed.
- Mm-hmm.

530
00:37:17.196 --> 00:37:19.531
Which means you play
our defending champion.

531
00:37:19.615 --> 00:37:21.533
Marco figueroa. in the first round.

532
00:37:21.617 --> 00:37:24.203
Perfect. He gets clobbered
in the first match.

533
00:37:24.286 --> 00:37:28.123
it frees up his whole weekend for that
fence I've been nagging him to put up.

534
00:37:28.832 --> 00:37:32.127
Get the hammer out.
Marco hasn't lost a match in five years.

535
00:37:32.211 --> 00:37:33.211
Neither has Joe.

536
00:37:38.425 --> 00:37:41.637
One of my dearest Chinese friends
a few thousand years ago said.

537
00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.600
"the longest journey
starts with a single step."

538
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.098
- You're ready.
- Oh. I doubt it.

539
00:37:45.182 --> 00:37:47.476
- Joe.
- Oh. yes. I'm ready. I'm ready.

540
00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:49.895
- Any sage advice?
- Most importantly. I think. uh...

541
00:37:49.978 --> 00:37:52.648
I know. Trust in al.

542
00:37:52.731 --> 00:37:54.358
Oh. al would appreciate that.

543
00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:56.318
but I was thinking
of something more spiritual.

544
00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:57.986
like forget about the mechanics.

545
00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.113
Who's al?
Is al that guy at the deli?

546
00:38:00.197 --> 00:38:01.949
Al. the almighty lord
does love pastrami.

547
00:38:02.032 --> 00:38:06.620
<i>Marco figueroa.

548
00:38:15.629 --> 00:38:17.965

549
00:38:18.048 --> 00:38:19.550
I see you brought a caddy.

550
00:38:19.633 --> 00:38:22.719
No thoughts for the day. okay?
It's all up inside you.

551
00:38:31.395 --> 00:38:32.771
Herbert?

552
00:38:32.855 --> 00:38:34.314

Thank you!
Thank you so much! Thank you.

590
00:40:54.997 --> 00:40:57.875
I haven't seen you play golf
like that before.

591
00:40:57.958 --> 00:41:02.379
Who would've thought? No.

592
00:41:02.462 --> 00:41:05.340
- I've never played golf like that before.
- Really?

593
00:41:05.424 --> 00:41:08.260
Not even when I was a kid. no.
Ever. Are you kidding?

594
00:41:09.428 --> 00:41:11.847
I'm so proud of you!

595
00:41:14.433 --> 00:41:17.519
I mean. I had my doubts.
Dove or no dove. but...

596
00:41:18.687 --> 00:41:19.938
I don't know. it's just...

597
00:41:20.022 --> 00:41:26.361
You're just becoming this new and improved
version of your younger self.

598
00:41:26.445 --> 00:41:31.783
I didn't think there was
that much room for improvement.

599
00:41:33.076 --> 00:41:35.579
Still don't think
god spoke to you. huh?

600
00:41:35.662 --> 00:41:40.834
Hmm. How can you seriously
weigh playing good golf

601
00:41:40.918 --> 00:41:44.004
against a family tragedy.
honey? That's all.

602
00:41:45.797 --> 00:41:46.882
I don't know.

603
00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:52.262
Maybe it's not about golf. or you.

604
00:41:53.722 --> 00:41:58.060
Maybe... maybe it's god
challenging people

605
00:41:58.143 --> 00:42:01.813
all over the world
who have become complacent to...

606
00:42:03.106 --> 00:42:06.777
To be more. to do more
than they ever thought possible.

607
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.863
And not take refuge
in their personal pain.

608
00:42:15.244 --> 00:42:16.328
I love you.

609
00:42:19.289 --> 00:42:20.666

613
00:42:46.608 --> 00:42:49.820

- Yeah?

614
00:42:49.903 --> 00:42:52.239
- What?
- Look at the garden.

615
00:42:52.322 --> 00:42:53.824
I'm sorry. baby.

616
00:42:54.741 --> 00:42:56.535
Really. I'm sorry.

617
00:42:56.618 --> 00:42:58.036
I'm so sorry.

Give me ten minutes. all right?
If you can.

623
00:43:43.081 --> 00:43:44.708
You got it! You got it!

624
00:43:45.792 --> 00:43:47.503
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

625
00:43:47.586 --> 00:43:48.962
I didn't want to bother you. sir.

626
00:43:49.046 --> 00:43:51.673
I got a call from herb
that you needed help?

627
00:43:52.508 --> 00:43:55.135
Uh. can you give me a hand?

628
00:43:55.219 --> 00:43:57.554
Yeah! May I? Okay.

629
00:43:59.765 --> 00:44:01.266
Is it doing it? Oh. it is!

630
00:44:12.653 --> 00:44:15.531
- Ta-da!
- Wow!

631
00:44:15.614 --> 00:44:17.199
Look at that!

632
00:44:17.282 --> 00:44:19.326
I'm just sorry it took so long.

633
00:44:19.409 --> 00:44:20.786
Oh! Oh! Oh!

634
00:44:23.956 --> 00:44:24.957
Two...

635
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.333
- three.
- My tongue was out.

636
00:44:26.416 --> 00:44:28.210
I just said. "but that's not a monkey."

637
00:44:28.293 --> 00:44:32.923
So that was...
That was what happened to... to me.

638
00:44:33.841 --> 00:44:36.927
- Oh. You good. daddy?
- Never better.

639
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:39.346
Except maybe that Tuesday in November

640
00:44:39.429 --> 00:44:42.391
when we adopted our bean dip
35 years ago.

641
00:44:42.474 --> 00:44:43.892
My favorite day.

642
00:44:43.976 --> 00:44:45.269
My favorite day.

643
00:44:45.352 --> 00:44:47.604
My favorite day. Period.

644
00:44:47.688 --> 00:44:49.481
- Bean dip.
- Definitely my favorite.

645
00:44:49.565 --> 00:44:50.959
You guys. I just can't stand to think

646
00:44:50.983 --> 00:44:53.463
that you're gonna start selling off
your retirement to help me.

647
00:44:53.527 --> 00:44:56.530
And I can't guarantee you. daddy.
that I'm not gonna be in the same exact...

648
00:44:56.613 --> 00:44:58.615
What? What?

649
00:44:59.783 --> 00:45:00.868
Please just tell me.

650
00:45:01.743 --> 00:45:03.036
Don't worry about it.

651
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.329
Because?

652
00:45:04.413 --> 00:45:06.582
Because your dad's gonna win
the championship

653
00:45:06.665 --> 00:45:08.959
of the world entire golf tournament.

654
00:45:09.042 --> 00:45:10.419
What? Daddy?

655
00:45:10.502 --> 00:45:13.797
Yep. And. um...

656
00:45:14.798 --> 00:45:17.426
I can't accept the prize money.

657
00:45:17.509 --> 00:45:19.678
but I can rent myself for endorsements.

658
00:45:19.761 --> 00:45:22.347
For jardin del sol.

659
00:45:23.974 --> 00:45:27.019
This is the crazy tournament
the crazy oil billionaire is funding.

660
00:45:27.102 --> 00:45:28.979
It's the biggest prize money
in history. daddy.

661
00:45:29.062 --> 00:45:31.148
All of the young guys are gonna be there.

662
00:45:31.231 --> 00:45:32.357
Have some faith.

663
00:45:32.441 --> 00:45:35.944
Yeah. He's gonna qualify
in Denver next week.

664
00:45:36.028 --> 00:45:38.864
And then he wins in palm Springs
two weeks later.

Thank you.

697
00:49:41.064 --> 00:49:43.650
No. not you. Me.

698
00:49:45.319 --> 00:49:48.155
I'm sent to help people
from the beginning of humankind.

699
00:49:48.906 --> 00:49:51.241
Win the world entire?

700
00:49:56.788 --> 00:49:58.957
Are you out of your mind?

701
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.794
Oh. god! Help!

702
00:50:06.173 --> 00:50:07.674
This fall's not gonna kill you.

703
00:50:07.758 --> 00:50:10.385
Probably make you an invalid.
which wouldn't be nice for Sheila.

704
00:50:10.469 --> 00:50:14.264
but if you still wanna die.
let's do it right now. I'll let go.

705
00:50:17.643 --> 00:50:18.810
No!

706
00:50:23.398 --> 00:50:25.859
Go back to your faith. Joe.

707
00:50:26.902 --> 00:50:29.154
Go back for you.

708
00:50:29.238 --> 00:50:30.822
You don't wanna die.

709
00:50:56.807 --> 00:50:57.808
Honey!

710
00:51:00.269 --> 00:51:01.895
You have to get up.

711
00:51:02.938 --> 00:51:07.317
You have to get up.
You have to get up.

712
00:51:07.401 --> 00:51:08.777
Come on with me.

713
00:51:08.861 --> 00:51:12.281
Honey. let's just get
a coffee first. Okay?

714
00:51:12.364 --> 00:51:13.365
Come on.

715
00:51:16.827 --> 00:51:18.203
Oh. my gosh!

716
00:51:18.287 --> 00:51:19.997
Oh. my god! Look at that!

717
00:51:20.664 --> 00:51:21.707
This is beautiful.

718
00:51:25.627 --> 00:51:27.713
Honey! How did this...

719
00:51:34.178 --> 00:51:37.264
Well. isn't that just such a clever way

720
00:51:37.347 --> 00:51:40.601
to keep you-know-who
in our good graces?

721
00:51:45.439 --> 00:51:48.942
{\an8}Well. here's one of golf's
most unusual stories.

722
00:51:49.026 --> 00:51:52.321
{\an8}In Denver today.
65-year-old Joe amable-amo

723
00:51:52.404 --> 00:51:56.408
won the southwest qualifier
for the championship of the world entire.

724
00:51:56.491 --> 00:52:00.245
{\an8}From new Mexico.
the bank president beat 40 guys

725
00:52:00.329 --> 00:52:03.290
{\an8}nowhere near his age like a bass drum.

726
00:52:03.373 --> 00:52:06.293
{\an8}Asked afterward how he did it.
amable-amo said.

727
00:52:06.376 --> 00:52:08.003
{\an8}"I'm a garden. blooming."

728
00:52:08.712 --> 00:52:10.756
{\an8}Really. Bloom away. old guy.

729
00:52:10.839 --> 00:52:15.636
{\an8}Amable-amo will now play in golf's richest
and most prestigious tournament.

730
00:52:15.719 --> 00:52:19.306
{\an8}Every major on the planet
will be gunning for the inaugural title

731
00:52:19.389 --> 00:52:22.226
{\an8}and its staggering $3 million prize.

732
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:27.272
The world entire is shaping up to be
the biggest golf tournament in history.

733
00:52:27.356 --> 00:52:30.150
{\an8}Any golfer who's anybody
will be playing in it.

734
00:52:30.234 --> 00:52:32.611
{\an8}And apparently. one golfer who's nobody.

735
00:53:20.742 --> 00:53:23.078
Wow!

736
00:54:03.952 --> 00:54:08.248
Mrs. Perkins from the bank
would like "a word." as she put it.

737
00:54:09.499 --> 00:54:12.419
One word? Sardines? Plankton?

738
00:54:12.503 --> 00:54:13.629
Mrs. Perkins.

739
00:54:13.712 --> 00:54:16.423
Mr. Amable-amo. Deadline approaching.

740
00:54:17.174 --> 00:54:19.134
That's five words. Mrs. Perkins.

741
00:54:19.218 --> 00:54:20.260
<i>Very amusing.</i>

742
00:54:20.344 --> 00:54:21.470
A friendly reminder.

743
00:54:21.553 --> 00:54:23.514
<i>And what form
does this "friendliness" take?</i>

744
00:54:23.597 --> 00:54:25.224
<i>If I were you...</i>

745
00:54:25.307 --> 00:54:26.850
I think we both agree you're not.

746
00:54:27.809 --> 00:54:29.102
I said "if."

747
00:54:29.186 --> 00:54:32.481
As me. Mrs. Plankton. you'd do what?

748
00:54:32.564 --> 00:54:35.150
I would get the foreclosure paperwork
ready for you to serve.

749
00:54:35.817 --> 00:54:40.113
Okay. Friendly reminder
taken as friendly. Thank you.

750
00:54:40.197 --> 00:54:44.201
And can you send the sardines on ice?

751
00:54:49.581 --> 00:54:51.959
- Something has happened.
- What?

752
00:54:52.042 --> 00:54:53.585
I don't know.

753
00:54:53.669 --> 00:54:55.504
But you are funny again.

754
00:54:55.587 --> 00:55:00.217
Just a temporary loss
of my inconsolable fury at the world.

755
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.802
Hmm.

756
00:55:08.058 --> 00:55:09.184
Sheila!

757
00:55:09.935 --> 00:55:10.978
Yes?

758
00:55:11.728 --> 00:55:12.855
You don't need that?

759
00:55:13.981 --> 00:55:15.482
What are you doing? Hmm.

760
00:55:16.483 --> 00:55:17.776
Are we breaking up?

761
00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:20.112
Take your time and love for me.

762
00:55:27.452 --> 00:55:29.496
- Good morning!
- Good morning. Sheila. Hi!

763
00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:32.958
There's the baby. Hi. how are you?

764
00:55:33.041 --> 00:55:34.668
- Hey!
- Hey. Joe!

765
00:55:34.751 --> 00:55:41.258
Okay. so. what I'm saying is.
win or lose. I'm here for you. Okay?

766
00:55:41.341 --> 00:55:45.345
But I think god chose the right two guys
for the mission.

767
00:55:45.429 --> 00:55:47.264
- Wow!
- I love you.

768
00:55:47.347 --> 00:55:48.557
I love you.

769
00:55:49.892 --> 00:55:50.976
It means a lot to me.

770
00:55:51.059 --> 00:55:52.936
Yeah. to me too. Sheila. Thanks.

771
00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:57.399
"So you shall go on your way.
and you shall not hurt your foot."

772
00:55:57.482 --> 00:56:00.485
Hey! Proverbs 3:23-3:24.

773
00:56:00.569 --> 00:56:01.653
Very good.

774
00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:25.511
Couldn't spring for a place
a little nicer. Joe?

775
00:56:25.594 --> 00:56:28.347
Put me on a nicer per diem.
we'll move up.

776
00:56:29.056 --> 00:56:30.641
My funds are spoken for.

777
00:56:31.725 --> 00:56:33.143
Of course!

778
00:56:37.731 --> 00:56:39.149
You sure showed those rabbits!

779
00:56:39.233 --> 00:56:41.318
Yeah. that's right.

780
00:56:43.946 --> 00:56:46.657
I guess things do work out
sometimes. sweetheart.

781
00:56:47.491 --> 00:56:48.617
You know. like for you.

782
00:56:49.868 --> 00:56:52.579
If you have hope and you have faith.

783
00:56:53.914 --> 00:56:56.041
and you're working to change reality.

784
00:56:57.209 --> 00:57:01.296
And to my shock and delight.

785
00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:05.008
a guy who's helping me
to help myself to be new again.

786
00:57:05.092 --> 00:57:08.428
Oh. I share in that delight. darling!

787
00:57:09.513 --> 00:57:11.515
- You're my mommy.
- Yes. I am.

788
00:57:17.229 --> 00:57:18.897
Let's hit it to palm Springs.

789
00:57:19.648 --> 00:57:21.441
- Right now?
- Yeah.

790
00:57:21.525 --> 00:57:24.945
We're gonna rent a bus.
go pick up the parents

791
00:57:25.028 --> 00:57:28.574
and all your kids and bring dad
a busload of hope!

792
00:57:30.617 --> 00:57:31.785
- Yes?
- Yeah. cool.

793
00:57:31.869 --> 00:57:32.995
Okay.

794
00:57:34.788 --> 00:57:37.291
{\an8}<i>This is the game's next evolution.</i>

795
00:57:38.375 --> 00:57:40.919
{\an8}<i>The richest prize in golf history.</i>

796
00:57:43.338 --> 00:57:47.718
{\an8}<i>This is their time. their world
and their championship to win.</i>

797
00:57:48.677 --> 00:57:51.555
{\an8}<i>A new era. a new tournament.</i>

798
00:57:51.638 --> 00:57:53.557
{\an8}<i>a new story will be written.</i>

799
00:57:57.728 --> 00:58:00.731
<i>The championship of the world entire.</i>

800
00:58:02.566 --> 00:58:05.986
{\an8}The richest golf tournament.
In the history of mankind. folks.

801
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:08.238
{\an8}Yeah. just about every country
and continent

802
00:58:08.322 --> 00:58:09.740
{\an8}are represented in this one.

803
00:58:09.823 --> 00:58:12.367
{\an8}The favorite. of course.
is Scotland's Archie borthwick

804
00:58:12.451 --> 00:58:14.286
{\an8}<i>who has won pretty much every tournament.</i>

805
00:58:14.369 --> 00:58:15.704
{\an8}<i>Except the biggie.</i>

806
00:58:15.787 --> 00:58:17.039
{\an8}<i>Like the world entire.</i>

807
00:58:17.122 --> 00:58:19.249
{\an8}Correct. Now borthwick
will be playing with the man

808
00:58:19.333 --> 00:58:21.502
{\an8}least likely to win the golf tournament.

809
00:58:21.585 --> 00:58:23.045
{\an8}Jose amable-amo...

810
00:58:23.128 --> 00:58:24.296
{\an8}It's Joe.

811
00:58:24.379 --> 00:58:25.547
{\an8}Hey. I don't know who he is.

812
00:58:25.631 --> 00:58:27.132
{\an8}- Joe amable-amo.
- Right.

813
00:58:27.216 --> 00:58:31.136
{\an8}The 65-year-old banker from new Mexico
who somehow qualified his way in.

814
00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.473
{\an8}Now. amable-amo is just thrilled
to be here. I'm sure.

815
00:58:34.556 --> 00:58:36.808
{\an8}Amable-amo winning this thing
would be like me

816
00:58:36.892 --> 00:58:39.686
{\an8}winning the nobel prize
for color commentary.

817
00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:42.356
{\an8}- In other words. no chance.
- Yep.

818
00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.441
Good morning. boys.

819
00:58:44.525 --> 00:58:46.002
- Good morning. gents!
- Good morning.

820
00:58:46.026 --> 00:58:48.820
- Pro-v.
- All right. we got a titleist. Yeah.

821
00:58:51.114 --> 00:58:52.533
Okay. Good luck.

822
00:58:54.368 --> 00:58:58.705

827
00:59:17.933 --> 00:59:21.270
<i>Camille is an interesting story
unto herself.</i>

828
00:59:21.353 --> 00:59:23.814
<i>A former miss america contestant
from Illinois.</i>

829
00:59:23.897 --> 00:59:27.359
<i>she was the first-ever deaf contestant
in the miss america contest</i>

830
00:59:27.442 --> 00:59:29.695
<i>and she finished third.</i>

831
00:59:29.778 --> 00:59:31.947
<i>Camille is right there
at her husband's side.</i>

832
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:34.658
<i>and she hopes for great results
in this tournament too.</i>

833
00:59:35.367 --> 00:59:39.329
<i>Wife and caddy. Cheering hard
for Archie to win this thing.</i>

834
00:59:39.413 --> 00:59:42.249
- Quiet. please.
- Okay. stay focused.

835
00:59:44.168 --> 00:59:45.586
Get in the hole!

Not much at stake though. really.

{\an8}Yeah. I don't believe it.

01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:14.044
{\an8}No. I'm an old. angry irishman.

867
01:03:14.127 --> 01:03:15.546
{\an8}Angry part's there.

868
01:03:15.629 --> 01:03:17.673
{\an8}Borthwick. however.
looking awfully strong

869
01:03:17.756 --> 01:03:21.885
{\an8}after a day two 66
currently in third place.

870
01:03:32.729 --> 01:03:33.814
You all right over there?

871
01:03:33.897 --> 01:03:34.898
Phew.

872
01:03:35.816 --> 01:03:38.861
This experience. this journey. you...

873
01:03:40.821 --> 01:03:43.073
It makes you think about. you know what?

874
01:03:45.742 --> 01:03:47.995
Yea. probably. but tell me anyway.

875
01:03:49.746 --> 01:03:52.374
Most religions since time immemorial

876
01:03:52.457 --> 01:03:58.297
have had something like what
the judeo-christians call the golden rule.

877
01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:02.384
Billions of people have been taught
to do for others

878
01:04:02.467 --> 01:04:06.388
without expectation of reciprocity.

879
01:04:09.224 --> 01:04:11.310
You'd think with a message
that simple and elegant.

880
01:04:11.393 --> 01:04:13.437
that you people would get along better.

881
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.605
Good night. Joe.

882
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.691
Good night. herb.

883
01:04:32.831 --> 01:04:35.250
- It's a glorious day. Joe.
- Yep.

884
01:04:35.334 --> 01:04:38.086
Hey. keep it going. pro! Pulling for ya!

885
01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:41.215
Why don't you caddy for him
the rest of the season. eh. wiley?

886
01:04:42.633 --> 01:04:44.343
See what you started?

887
01:04:44.426 --> 01:04:47.179
You must be tired of me
chokin' major after major.

888
01:04:48.597 --> 01:04:49.765
What do you say?

889
01:04:50.557 --> 01:04:55.687
{\an8}The unlikely Joe amable-amo
at the age of 65

890
01:04:55.771 --> 01:04:58.857
{\an8}goes birdie. birdie on ten and eleven!

891
01:04:58.941 --> 01:05:01.276
{\an8}He's right there in the hunt.
I mean. what are the odds?

892
01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.987
<i>No odds. Not even
on the board. Dave. It can't be.</i>

893
01:05:06.865 --> 01:05:08.951
Uh. before you hit your next shot.

894
01:05:09.034 --> 01:05:13.038
you might wanna take a look
over yonder at that gallery.

895
01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:17.084
Coming through.
Thank you. thank you!

896
01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:18.168
Mm-hmm.

897
01:05:19.253 --> 01:05:20.671
He's right there. Hi!

898
01:05:20.754 --> 01:05:24.216
Oh!

899
01:05:24.299 --> 01:05:25.467
Who's that with 'em?

900
01:05:25.551 --> 01:05:26.927
- The bikers?
- Yeah.

901
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:28.679
Hey. president and founder.

902
01:05:30.389 --> 01:05:32.266
You're telling me
they're called the apostles?

903
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:33.642
Hello!

904
01:05:34.852 --> 01:05:36.144
- Hi. sweetheart.
- Hi.

905
01:05:37.062 --> 01:05:39.398
Hello. everybody! Hello!

906
01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:41.483
Thank you. gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

907
01:05:42.317 --> 01:05:44.653
<i>And with a birdie on 18.</i>

908
01:05:44.736 --> 01:05:47.739
{\an8}Joe amable-amo.
alone in second place.

909
01:05:47.823 --> 01:05:51.285
{\an8}We all obviously
got this guy all wrong. David.

910
01:05:51.368 --> 01:05:54.246
{\an8}Yeah. I mean. he's behind
the tournament leader. Archie borthwick

911
01:05:54.329 --> 01:05:57.332
{\an8}by just one shot and they are going to be
paired together tomorrow.

912
01:05:57.416 --> 01:06:00.544
{\an8}Can you imagine the final round
we've got ahead of us tomorrow?

913
01:06:00.627 --> 01:06:04.548
{\an8}Borthwick. amable-amo...
History or consigned to oblivion?

914
01:06:04.631 --> 01:06:06.008
{\an8}- Stay tuned.

<i>♪ Someday you'll turn around ♪</i>

916
01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:12.639

919
01:06:20.189 --> 01:06:23.692
I'm gonna give my fingers a rest.
I'll be back in five.

920
01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:31.700
- Hey!
- Hey.

921
01:06:32.618 --> 01:06:35.495
Playing together again. huh?
Final twosome? Final round?

922
01:06:36.413 --> 01:06:38.957
And the borthwicks. What happened?
What did they do?

923
01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:40.709
Hit a fancy bistro all alone?

924
01:06:41.502 --> 01:06:45.130
Archibald's not big on human communion.

925
01:06:45.214 --> 01:06:48.133
Camille and I try to work it out with him.

926
01:06:48.217 --> 01:06:51.220
But. you know. what are you gonna do?
He's just. you know.

927
01:06:51.303 --> 01:06:54.640
He likes you guys though.
You know that. don't you?

928
01:06:54.723 --> 01:06:56.850
- Hey.
- He's just a little. well...

929
01:06:56.934 --> 01:07:00.103
The feelings of expectation
of him are huge.

930
01:07:00.187 --> 01:07:06.068
and his feelings of obligation
to fulfill those expectations even huger.

931
01:07:06.151 --> 01:07:09.321
You read his psychiatric report.

932
01:07:09.404 --> 01:07:11.615
No. I felt that I've been there.

933
01:07:11.698 --> 01:07:14.326
"No temptation has overtaken you
that is uncommon to man.

934
01:07:14.409 --> 01:07:16.703
God is faithful. He will never
allow you to be tested

935
01:07:16.787 --> 01:07:18.288
beyond your ability."

936
01:07:18.372 --> 01:07:20.874
- That goes for you too.
- Thank you.

937
01:07:20.958 --> 01:07:22.125
I needed that.

938
01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:24.169
Archie. John quiñones.

939
01:07:24.253 --> 01:07:26.296
How does it feel like
playing in the final pairing

940
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.340
in the world's richest golf tournament?

941
01:07:28.423 --> 01:07:31.009
Playing against a man
who's twice your age?

942
01:07:31.093 --> 01:07:33.887
It's a joke.

943
01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:36.306
A joke? What's the funny part?

944
01:07:39.685 --> 01:07:42.229
- Sorry. John. Big fan.
- Thank you.

945
01:07:42.312 --> 01:07:46.316
Joe amable-amo. Your opponent
considers your participation

946
01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.778
in this high moment of drama a joke.

947
01:07:49.862 --> 01:07:51.446
What do you think of that?

948
01:07:51.530 --> 01:07:57.035
Well. herb and I have been laughing
for the last three days.

949
01:07:57.119 --> 01:08:01.456
So. I think he's right.

950
01:08:04.168 --> 01:08:06.128
I hope you and Chong
get back together.

951
01:08:08.005 --> 01:08:10.549
{\an8}Joe amable-amo.
all alone in second place.

952
01:08:10.632 --> 01:08:14.469
{\an8}And the tournament leader.
Archibald borthwick. ready to go here.

953
01:08:14.553 --> 01:08:18.182
<i>Borthwick has a one-shot lead
on the amiable amable-amo</i>

954
01:08:18.265 --> 01:08:19.600
<i>with 18 holes to play.</i>

955
01:08:19.683 --> 01:08:21.602
<i>This should be very interesting.</i>

956
01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:23.325
- <i>I'm hoping for history.</i>
- Careful. boys.

957
01:08:23.353 --> 01:08:25.022
I'm sporting a lucky hat.

958
01:08:25.856 --> 01:08:27.024
Have a good round.

959
01:08:27.858 --> 01:08:29.443
He's lucky he got it on his head.

960
01:08:29.526 --> 01:08:33.113
Please welcome.
from las cruces. new Mexico. usa.

961
01:08:33.197 --> 01:08:34.698
Joe amable-amo.

962
01:08:44.957 --> 01:08:46.877
Nothing to fear but success. Joe.

963
01:08:53.884 --> 01:08:56.220
<i>Beautiful drive by amable-amo.</i>

964
01:08:56.303 --> 01:08:58.430
<i>Not gonna beat you with a power game.</i>

965
01:08:58.514 --> 01:09:00.015
<i>but just splits the fairway.</i>

966
01:09:00.807 --> 01:09:02.518
Now that's a drive. yeah.

967
01:09:09.524 --> 01:09:12.653
And from Scotland. Archie borthwick.

968
01:09:12.736 --> 01:09:14.029
Baba booey!

969
01:09:14.112 --> 01:09:15.948
<i>Archie borthwick on the tee.</i>

970
01:09:16.031 --> 01:09:20.786
<i>And he has been outdriving amable-amo
by about 50 or 60 yards.</i>

971
01:09:20.868 --> 01:09:22.996
<i>And I would expect
to see the same right here.</i>

972
01:09:26.332 --> 01:09:28.292
<i>Borthwick with a beauty!</i>

973
01:09:30.629 --> 01:09:33.465
He wants to slide a little.
but what have I taught you?

974
01:09:34.383 --> 01:09:35.384
Foolproof!

975
01:09:35.466 --> 01:09:36.468
Knock it in. bro.

976
01:09:39.095 --> 01:09:41.598
<i>Amable-amo from about 12 feet.</i>

977
01:09:41.682 --> 01:09:44.309
<i>He needs this to stay one shot
behind borthwick.</i>

978
01:09:44.393 --> 01:09:47.187
<i>and he has been fantastic
with the putter all tournament long.</i>

979
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.189
<i>And. Terry. that's usually
the first thing to go</i>

980
01:09:49.273 --> 01:09:51.233
<i>when you get to about 40 years of age.</i>

981
01:09:51.316 --> 01:09:52.734
<i>Speak for yourself.</i>

982
01:09:53.484 --> 01:09:55.654
<i>Looks like he's got the line!</i>

983
01:10:01.159 --> 01:10:05.163
<i>Oh. wow!
He just keeps making us wrong.</i>

984
01:10:05.247 --> 01:10:07.833
<i>Amable-amo with just a beautiful par.</i>

985
01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:11.128
<i>keeping pace just one shot off the lead.</i>

986
01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:13.338
<i>One shot behind Archie borthwick.
Amazing.</i>

987
01:10:13.422 --> 01:10:15.257
That was good!

988
01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.384
<i>This guy.
he's like a fart in a space suit.</i>

989
01:10:17.467 --> 01:10:19.303
{\an8}He just will not go away.

990
01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:21.138
{\an8}Uh. okay.

991
01:10:21.221 --> 01:10:23.473
Hey. uh. arch. Favorite movie line.

992
01:10:24.349 --> 01:10:26.393
Few movies. lot of golf.

"Go ahead. make my day."
<i>Dirty Harry.</i>

994
01:10:28.687 --> 01:10:32.482
Yeah. mine is. uh... I watched it...
With the shark.

995
01:10:32.566 --> 01:10:34.443
It's. uh... <i>Teeth?</i>

996
01:10:34.526 --> 01:10:37.154
<i>Teeth?</i> no. it's jaws. bro.

997
01:10:37.863 --> 01:10:39.865
- "I'm gonna need a bigger..."
- "...Bigger boat."

998
01:10:41.867 --> 01:10:42.910
Yeah.

999
01:10:47.206 --> 01:10:50.918
We've got 225 to the pin.
220 to the center.

1000
01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:55.172
so I want you to carry the front.
let it release back to the pin.

1001
01:10:55.255 --> 01:10:56.840
Uh. slice hotch.

1002
01:10:57.466 --> 01:11:00.802
Trust your swing
and let the monkey loose. <i>mijo.</i>

1003
01:11:02.054 --> 01:11:05.349
<i>Amable-amo now here
on the tee at the fourth.</i>

1004
01:11:05.432 --> 01:11:09.394
<i>How about this hole? 240 yard par 3.</i>

1005
01:11:09.478 --> 01:11:11.021
<i>He thinks he can get there</i>

1006
01:11:11.104 --> 01:11:13.315
<i>with this really strange-looking
extra-long club</i>

1007
01:11:13.398 --> 01:11:15.734
<i>that looks like an elephant's toenail
on a stick.</i>

1008
01:11:16.735 --> 01:11:18.153
- <i>And he hits it.</i>
- Whoo!

1009
01:11:19.446 --> 01:11:20.948
<i>Oh. he hits it to perfection!</i>

1010
01:11:21.031 --> 01:11:23.700
<i>Wow. look at this.
To about three feet.</i>

1011
01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:26.286
<i>A beautiful shot by amable-amo.</i>

1012
01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:27.871
Absolutely heavenly!

1013
01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:31.250
Wiley! Don't. Don't. Get out!

1014
01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:40.259
<i>Borthwick with a very good look
at birdie here to maintain the lead.</i>

1015
01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:44.638
<i>Oh. a tough miss.</i>

1016
01:11:45.597 --> 01:11:48.934
<i>So that par now gonna put
borthwick and amable-amo</i>

1017
01:11:49.017 --> 01:11:51.395
<i>into a share of first place. David.</i>

1018
01:11:51.478 --> 01:11:55.107
<i>You know. Terry.
borthwick. he just looks bewildered now</i>

1019
01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:56.900
<i>that this old goat won't go away.</i>

1020
01:11:56.984 --> 01:12:00.195
{\an8}<i>I mean. he might be starting to unravel.
we've seen it before.</i>

1021
01:12:00.279 --> 01:12:03.740
<i>His wife. Camille and caddy wiley

<i>to make sure this young man stays focused
and doesn't fall apart.</i>

1023

The boy's having
a tough time. huh. wiley?

1024
01:12:10.622 --> 01:12:12.583
When is Archie
gonna win the big one?

1025
01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:15.836
What kind of career can a guy have
when he don't win the big one?

1026
01:12:15.919 --> 01:12:17.504
One of the great things
of being my age.

1027
01:12:17.588 --> 01:12:19.214
Potential is dust in the wind.

1028
01:12:19.298 --> 01:12:20.775
Oh. I like that song. It's a little grim.

1029
01:12:20.799 --> 01:12:22.968
but if you substitute "lobsters"
for "dust."

1030
01:12:23.051 --> 01:12:26.680
<i>♪ Lobsters in the wind ♪</i>

1031

01:12:49.828 --> 01:12:53.624
<i>Joe amable-amo on the tee
here at the fifth.</i>

1033
01:13:01.298 --> 01:13:02.341
Archie!

1034
01:13:04.426 --> 01:13:06.094
I have to win this tournament.

1035
01:13:06.887 --> 01:13:08.388
But I really believe in you.

1036
01:13:09.848 --> 01:13:10.849
Let's go. arch.

1037
01:13:11.725 --> 01:13:13.602
Have I ever told you my recipe for cider?

1038
01:13:17.606 --> 01:13:18.607
Oh!

1039
01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:21.276
<i>Oh. and that is just
a terrible tee shot.</i>

1040
01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.446
<i>The only way to say it for borthwick.
here at the seventh.</i>

1041
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:29.993
<i>This young man
is definitely starting to...</i>

1042
01:13:30.077 --> 01:13:31.828
<i>Well. his head's about to fall off.</i>

1043
01:13:34.957 --> 01:13:37.584
He's got that two-way miss
going. huh. wiley?

1044
01:13:37.668 --> 01:13:39.586
Wiley. Come on. man.

1045
01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:41.689
You tell him to relax.
you're just gonna agitate him.

1046
01:13:41.713 --> 01:13:43.298
Yeah. that's been our pattern.

1047
01:13:43.382 --> 01:13:46.426
Right. arch. I think you take the seven.
Punch it out in the middle there.

1048
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:49.137
Take your medicine and take the par.

1049
01:13:49.221 --> 01:13:51.390
No. I'll play the three.

1050
01:13:52.724 --> 01:13:54.726
Archie. take the seven.
That's the right club.

1051
01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:56.103
Three.

1052
01:13:56.186 --> 01:13:57.563
- Come on. man.
- Wiley!

1053
01:13:59.898 --> 01:14:01.859
Just give me the club. huh?

1054
01:14:01.942 --> 01:14:03.235
We shouldn't be watching.

1055
01:14:04.319 --> 01:14:07.239
It's like looking through
someone's bedroom window.

1056
01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:23.005
Nice and easy swing.
you've done it a thousand times before.

1057
01:14:23.088 --> 01:14:24.256
I believe in you.

1058
01:14:29.928 --> 01:14:31.180
All you. all day.

1059
01:14:48.989 --> 01:14:51.074
You don't have to feel obligated
to imitate him

1060
01:14:51.158 --> 01:14:52.910
because he has unfulfilled talent.

1061
01:14:53.785 --> 01:14:56.705
Yeah. okay. Let's go find your ball.

1062
01:14:56.788 --> 01:15:00.542
Now his. Lassie couldn't find it
if it was wrapped in bacon.

1063
01:15:01.251 --> 01:15:04.588
{\an8}So with a par by amable-amo
on this eighth hole.

1064
01:15:04.671 --> 01:15:07.591
{\an8}and that bogie by borthwick.
amable-amo...

1065
01:15:07.674 --> 01:15:09.760
{\an8}Here's a phrase I did not expect to utter.

1066
01:15:09.843 --> 01:15:13.597
{\an8}...is now the leader
of this golf tournament by one stroke.

1067
01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.183
{\an8}Well. you know. I wouldn't be
one to say I told you so.

1068
01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:17.351
{\an8}Because you didn't.

1069
01:15:17.434 --> 01:15:19.895
{\an8}No. You're right.
I didn't. I didn't see it either.

1070
01:15:19.978 --> 01:15:22.147
You play your game. Nobody else's.

1071
01:15:22.231 --> 01:15:23.690
Is anyone else's available?

1072
01:15:23.774 --> 01:15:27.194
I'll think of some other clichés
I can throw at you.

1073
01:15:28.028 --> 01:15:29.154
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

1074
01:15:29.238 --> 01:15:31.657
Yeah. sorry. Joe.
I'm not much of a fisherman.

1075
01:15:33.825 --> 01:15:36.370
Carp is a bony. malodorous fish.

1076
01:15:36.453 --> 01:15:39.248
<i>Carpe diem</i> means "seize the day."

1077
01:15:39.331 --> 01:15:43.502
Yeah! My boy Horace. 26 bc.
"odes."

1078
01:15:43.585 --> 01:15:45.879
Yeah. that's right. Ode Horace.

1079
01:15:45.963 --> 01:15:47.214
Known to his mates as...

1080
01:15:47.297 --> 01:15:48.465
Sparky.

1081
01:15:49.424 --> 01:15:52.886
Aha! Well done. mate! Cheers.

1082
01:15:54.388 --> 01:15:55.988
- The guy's all right.
- Thanks for that.

1083
01:16:18.328 --> 01:16:19.328
Attaboy!

1084
01:16:32.259 --> 01:16:34.970
<i>Borthwick
with a fabulous eagle putt.</i>

1085
01:16:35.053 --> 01:16:37.222
<i>Yeah. he seems to have
regained some composure.</i>

1086
01:16:37.306 --> 01:16:40.309
<i>Mm-hmm. And with it.
a share of the lead now.</i>

1087
01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:51.236
<i>Amable-amo with yet another birdie.</i>

1088
01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:54.156
<i>Yeah. he and his caddy
are certainly having a good time.</i>

1089
01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:57.659
<i>I've never seen two sober people
on a golf course have this much fun.</i>

1090
01:17:00.871 --> 01:17:04.416
{\an8}Joe amable-amo. now the leader
of this golf tournament.

1091
01:17:05.042 --> 01:17:08.879
{\an8}But borthwick is just one behind
after that fabulous eagle on 13.

1092
01:17:09.463 --> 01:17:11.924
<i>Five holes to go.
Who wants it more?</i>

1093
01:17:12.007 --> 01:17:15.594
I heard about your family.
the loss you all had.

1094
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:19.223
It's very kind of you. Thank you.

1095
01:17:19.306 --> 01:17:23.852
Joe! Joe! Joe!

1096
01:17:38.784 --> 01:17:39.952
Same as yesterday?

1097
01:17:40.035 --> 01:17:43.121
Right down the middle
left of the sand trap.

1098
01:17:44.081 --> 01:17:45.165
Easy swing.

1099
01:17:51.004 --> 01:17:52.756
Watching you. Joe.

1100
01:17:53.465 --> 01:17:56.927
I think Archie might be
getting a lesson in... life.

1101
01:17:57.010 --> 01:17:59.346
It's him. wiley. Him.

1102
01:18:01.014 --> 01:18:02.015
Get in the hole!

1103
01:18:05.102 --> 01:18:09.064
{\an8}Joe amable-amo
with just an incredible birdie on 14

1104
01:18:09.147 --> 01:18:11.066
{\an8}and still in the lead.

1105
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:14.570
{\an8}But borthwick is still on his heels.
just a shot behind.

1106
01:18:14.653 --> 01:18:16.655
{\an8}They're going to have
to wait a little while here

1107
01:18:16.738 --> 01:18:19.032
{\an8}as play has slowed
and the field is really backed up.

1108
01:18:19.116 --> 01:18:20.492
{\an8}Hmm. More time to think.

1109
01:18:20.576 --> 01:18:22.578
{\an8}- which usually. is not a good thing.
- No.

1110
01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:32.296
The guy's probably lost the ball up there.

1111
01:18:44.725 --> 01:18:45.851
What?

1112
01:18:47.978 --> 01:18:52.065
My family. what we've been through.
what we've lost.

1113
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:54.693
Well. there's no explanation

1114
01:18:54.776 --> 01:18:56.570
that could be understood
at the human level.

1115
01:18:56.653 --> 01:18:59.823
Everything all right. Joe?
You're on the tee box.

1116
01:19:03.118 --> 01:19:05.204
Climax of drama.

1117
01:19:05.287 --> 01:19:07.706
Climax of drama. very exciting.

1118
01:19:17.925 --> 01:19:19.801
You have anything else to offer?

1119
01:19:19.885 --> 01:19:21.929
Now. here. Anything for me?

1120
01:19:22.679 --> 01:19:23.847
You gotta have faith. Joe.

1121
01:19:23.931 --> 01:19:26.517
Faith that I can blah. blah. blah.

1122
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.560
- Well. in the book of job...
- Please.

1123
01:19:30.187 --> 01:19:32.022
Joe. who are you to question god?

1124
01:19:33.273 --> 01:19:35.901
Well. supposedly.
the chosen old guy golfer

1125
01:19:35.984 --> 01:19:39.154
sent to prove who the hell knows?

1126
01:19:39.947 --> 01:19:43.951
Pardon the satanic references
at this juncture.

1127
01:19:46.495 --> 01:19:48.330
"For I know that my redeemer lives.

1128
01:19:48.413 --> 01:19:51.333
and at last. he will stand
upon the golf course."

1129
01:19:51.416 --> 01:19:55.754
Well. if your redeemer doesn't get here
by this afternoon.

1130
01:19:55.838 --> 01:19:57.673
there ain't gonna be anyone here.

1131
01:20:04.972 --> 01:20:06.014
I'm here.

1132
01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.356
Welcome back. son.

1133
01:20:17.192 --> 01:20:18.318
I love you.

1134
01:20:30.247 --> 01:20:32.249
<i>Amable-amo.
here's that distance again.</i>

1135
01:20:32.332 --> 01:20:35.377
Just about 20 feet for birdie.

1136
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:38.130
to maintain a share of the lead. David.

1137
01:20:38.213 --> 01:20:41.925
And need I remind everybody.
three million American dollars.

1138
01:20:47.598 --> 01:20:50.809
- Yeah! Whoa!
- Come on!

1139
01:21:21.673 --> 01:21:23.133
I know you know this. but...

1140
01:21:24.384 --> 01:21:27.554
This tee shot plays
like a slight dogleg left.

1141
01:21:29.598 --> 01:21:32.434
Almost ended up
in the water myself yesterday.

1142
01:21:35.562 --> 01:21:36.730
Thank you. Archie.

1143
01:21:43.654 --> 01:21:45.489
You see? He's not a bad guy.

1144
01:21:47.324 --> 01:21:48.575
He's got daddy issues.

1145
01:21:49.368 --> 01:21:53.747
Dad raised his boy
to be all the things dad wasn't.

1146
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:55.916
isn't. never will be.

1147
01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.003
The kid will never.
never win the old man's love

1148
01:22:00.087 --> 01:22:01.630
till he wins a major.

1149
01:22:02.631 --> 01:22:05.509
He sees the kid
marries miss Illinois.

1150
01:22:06.927 --> 01:22:09.096
Dad says arch will never hang on to her.

1151
01:22:09.179 --> 01:22:11.014
Well. he's wrong so far.

1152
01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.144
Well. Archie could have
stayed at home

1153
01:22:16.228 --> 01:22:17.938
counting his money
with his beautiful wife.

1154
01:22:18.021 --> 01:22:19.857
Instead. he's here testing himself.

1155
01:22:20.899 --> 01:22:23.944
trying to figure out
how to relax under the stress

1156
01:22:24.027 --> 01:22:26.613
of his own and his dad's expectations.

1157
01:22:26.697 --> 01:22:27.781
Hmm.

1158
01:22:28.866 --> 01:22:29.950
You try it.

1159
01:22:30.617 --> 01:22:33.620
- He did. Wiley played.
- Yep.

1160
01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.457
That's why I'm caddying.

1161
01:22:37.541 --> 01:22:38.917
{\an8}This incredible day.

1162
01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:42.212
{\an8}This incredible final round
is not done yet.

1163
01:22:42.296 --> 01:22:44.798
{\an8}It all comes down to this. the 18th.

1164
01:22:44.882 --> 01:22:47.426
{\an8}Joe amable-amo
of las cruces. new Mexico

1165
01:22:47.509 --> 01:22:52.514
<i>and Archibald borthwick of Scotland
tied for the lead.</i>

1166
01:22:53.182 --> 01:22:54.766
Whatever happens here. Joe.

1167
01:22:57.519 --> 01:22:59.062
I need you to know that...

1168
01:23:03.525 --> 01:23:05.194
Playing this round. it's...

1169
01:23:06.028 --> 01:23:07.279
With you...

1170
01:23:10.282 --> 01:23:11.408
You know what?

1171
01:23:20.083 --> 01:23:21.168
Good luck.

1172
01:23:24.379 --> 01:23:25.464
You all right?

1173
01:23:29.301 --> 01:23:32.304
Well. here it is.
Your favorite birdie hole.

1174
01:23:33.388 --> 01:23:35.015
Same as yesterday.

1175
01:23:35.098 --> 01:23:37.684
Down the right side. equal to the center.

1176
01:23:38.852 --> 01:23:39.978
Bring us home.

1177
01:23:40.062 --> 01:23:41.813
- Quiet please.
- Thanks. wiley.

1178
01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.533
Get in the hole!

1179
01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:05.379
You know there's no pressure here.
unless of course you think there is.

1180
01:24:06.505 --> 01:24:11.343
I've never felt pressure like this
in my life. herbie.

1181
01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:13.554
But you know what?

1182
01:24:14.429 --> 01:24:16.056
Yeah. You love it.

1183
01:24:17.558 --> 01:24:21.311
All right. Keep it from going left. yeah.

1184
01:24:24.773 --> 01:24:25.899
Left.

1185
01:25:02.811 --> 01:25:04.021
Left.

1186
01:25:35.761 --> 01:25:38.263
<i>Wait. what? What?
Is that a dove?</i>

1187
01:25:40.599 --> 01:25:44.144
<i>Did a dove just grab amable-amo's ball
and drop it in a bush?</i>

1188
01:25:45.979 --> 01:25:48.482
I think I know who might be
responsible for that.

1189
01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:52.569
<i>The bush is now on fire!
I don't believe what I'm seeing!</i>

1190
01:25:52.653 --> 01:25:54.613
<i>What's next? A pack of locusts?</i>

1191
01:25:55.447 --> 01:25:58.033
<i>We've seen a lot of birdies today.
but nothing quite like that.</i>

1192
01:25:58.659 --> 01:26:00.202
Thanks. Thanks for doing that.

1193
01:26:04.289 --> 01:26:05.958
Is that your ball right there?

1194
01:26:07.417 --> 01:26:11.046
Yep. That's my ball.

1195
01:26:11.129 --> 01:26:13.257
I'm afraid it is. That's your ball.

1196
01:26:14.299 --> 01:26:18.303
Joe. you play the ball as it lies
or under rule number 19-1 and 14-3.

1197
01:26:18.387 --> 01:26:20.264
you're allowed to declare the ball
unplayable.

1198
01:26:20.347 --> 01:26:23.016
take a drop with a new ball
and incur a one-stroke penalty.

1199
01:26:24.768 --> 01:26:26.311
Yeah. I think that we should...

1200
01:26:29.064 --> 01:26:31.817
I'll take the one-stroke penalty
and declare it unplayable.

1201
01:26:33.527 --> 01:26:35.487
Burning bush. God says?

1202
01:26:35.571 --> 01:26:38.240
"I will be who I will be."

1203
01:26:38.323 --> 01:26:41.702
{\an8}David. I'm not even sure I believe
what I just saw.

1204
01:26:42.327 --> 01:26:46.039
{\an8}I think it's safe to say
Joe amable-amo's ball is unplayable but...

1205
01:26:46.123 --> 01:26:48.041
{\an8}I think it's safe to say
that it's inflammable.

1206
01:26:48.125 --> 01:26:49.126
{\an8}Uh. yeah.

1207
01:26:49.209 --> 01:26:51.295
<i>Even. he's gotta laugh at this.</i>

1208
01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:54.464
{\an8}I've been tempted all day to say
there's something biblical about this day

1209
01:26:54.548 --> 01:26:56.008
{\an8}and this round of golf.

1210
01:26:56.091 --> 01:26:57.217
{\an8}I'm starting to believe you.

1211
01:26:57.301 --> 01:26:58.802
I've never seen that before.

1212
01:26:59.803 --> 01:27:01.054
Nor have I.

1213
01:27:03.599 --> 01:27:04.850
Deep breaths. Joe.

1214
01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:12.983
Enjoy the place. The time. The moment.

1215
01:27:15.277 --> 01:27:16.361
You earned it.

1216
01:27:19.489 --> 01:27:20.699
Thank you. Archie.

1217
01:27:21.491 --> 01:27:22.701
You're a good man.

1218
01:27:58.737 --> 01:27:59.821
Here you go. Archie.

1219
01:28:00.822 --> 01:28:02.699
A little bit of a left to right wind.

1220
01:28:02.783 --> 01:28:04.952
- Look at the pin placement.
- Yeah.

1221
01:28:05.035 --> 01:28:06.828
Okay. 182.

1222
01:28:07.412 --> 01:28:09.206
- 182.
- Put her up there.

1223
01:28:32.521 --> 01:28:34.022
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

1224
01:28:39.111 --> 01:28:40.946
Ow!

1225
01:28:41.029 --> 01:28:43.532
<i>Amable-amo
needs to make this putt</i>

1226
01:28:43.615 --> 01:28:46.618
{\an8}and have borthwick miss
for this to be tied

1227
01:28:46.702 --> 01:28:48.704
<i>and we would go to a playoff.</i>

1228
01:28:48.787 --> 01:28:52.416
<i>And with everything that we have seen.
I wouldn't mind seeing more golf.</i>

1229
01:28:52.499 --> 01:28:56.587
Ladies and gentlemen. please welcome
the tournament co-leaders

1230
01:28:56.670 --> 01:29:00.507
from las cruces. new Mexico.
Joe amable-amo!

1231
01:29:01.675 --> 01:29:05.345
<i>Well. here it is. the final hole
of the world entire.</i>

1232
01:29:06.305 --> 01:29:08.807
Try not to start anything on fire.
Till I get back.

1233
01:29:08.891 --> 01:29:12.519
And from Scotland. Archie borthwick.

1234
01:29:16.023 --> 01:29:17.691
There's nothing there. Straight up.

1235
01:29:17.774 --> 01:29:20.611
Good speed. Straight putt.

1236
01:29:20.694 --> 01:29:23.363
<i>Borthwick's 12-footer
is a little bit right to left.</i>

1237
01:29:23.447 --> 01:29:26.700
<i>and he's made many of these putts
throughout his career.</i>

1238
01:29:26.783 --> 01:29:31.455
<i>If he makes this one. he's the winner
of the championship of the world entire.</i>

1239
01:29:32.331 --> 01:29:33.457
That's all it is.

1240
01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:35.876
A cup and a half out. Right to left.

1241
01:29:35.959 --> 01:29:37.085
All about the speed.

1242
01:29:37.169 --> 01:29:38.921
- A cup and a half?
- Mm-hmm.

1243
01:29:40.130 --> 01:29:42.466
<i>If he makes this. folks.
this week.</i>

1244
01:29:42.549 --> 01:29:45.135
<i>this long strange day is over.</i>

1245
01:29:45.219 --> 01:29:46.512
<i>It has been that.</i>

1246
01:29:50.098 --> 01:29:53.560
<i>How many times has Archie borthwick</i>

1247
01:29:53.644 --> 01:29:57.523
<i>been in a big event
just to see it fall by the wayside?</i>

1248
01:29:57.606 --> 01:30:02.069
<i>Hasn't been able to come through.
But now. has that opportunity.</i>

1249
01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.864
<i>Amazing that it would
come down to this.</i>

1250
01:30:07.658 --> 01:30:09.743
<i>This for the win.</i>

1251
01:30:25.175 --> 01:30:29.847
<i>The tap in and now it is up
to Joe amable-amo. Amazing.</i>

1252
01:30:32.474 --> 01:30:38.021
<i>Joe amable-amo. the 65-year-old
from new Mexico has a five-footer.</i>

1253
01:30:38.105 --> 01:30:40.941
<i>To send this
to a sudden death playoff.</i>

1254
01:30:41.024 --> 01:30:43.652
I have faith you're gonna
make this putt.

1255
01:30:43.735 --> 01:30:45.737
The question is. do you?

1256
01:30:48.657 --> 01:30:51.410
Foolproof. herb. Foolproof.

1257
01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:45.589
I will be who I will be.

1258
01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:48.425
Thank you. al.

1259
01:31:58.727 --> 01:32:02.105
<i>So the miss for amable-amo
and that is it.</i>

1260
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:08.612
<i>It's Archie borthwick who's now the winner
of the championship of the world entire.</i>

1261
01:32:08.695 --> 01:32:10.781
<i>Do you believe
what we have seen today?</i>

1262
01:32:10.864 --> 01:32:13.367
<i>No. I can't imagine
what this must feel like</i>

1263
01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:14.618
<i>for Archie borthwick.</i>

1264
01:32:14.701 --> 01:32:16.912
<i>The monkey is finally off his back.</i>

1265
01:32:16.995 --> 01:32:18.997
<i>He's a major winner!</i>

1266
01:32:19.081 --> 01:32:21.458
<i>It's a life-changing moment
for this young man.</i>

1267
01:32:26.755 --> 01:32:28.674
Oh. ye of abundant faith.

1268
01:32:31.051 --> 01:32:32.469
You missed that putt on purpose.

1269
01:32:50.779 --> 01:32:55.951
Ladies and gentlemen. the winner
of the championship of the world entire.

1270
01:32:56.034 --> 01:32:57.452
Archibald borthwick!

1271
01:33:09.423 --> 01:33:10.757
You're my champion!

1272
01:33:14.928 --> 01:33:16.346
Yeah!

1273
01:33:38.118 --> 01:33:40.746
- Congratulations. champ.
- I know what happened here.

1274
01:33:40.829 --> 01:33:42.789
Woo-hoo!

1275
01:33:42.873 --> 01:33:43.874
Joe.

1276
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.084
Thank you. sir.

1277
01:33:46.877 --> 01:33:49.087
Wiley. you've done a good job.

1278
01:33:50.088 --> 01:33:51.131
You're the man.

1279
01:33:51.215 --> 01:33:52.466
Thank you.

1280
01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:54.593
Yes!

1281
01:33:59.473 --> 01:34:00.599
Joe!

1282
01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.978
Take a deep breath.

1283
01:34:07.022 --> 01:34:09.191
You deserve the feeling you're getting.

1284
01:34:11.193 --> 01:34:12.861
Congratulations.

1285
01:34:13.529 --> 01:34:15.447
You're really a great man.

1286
01:34:18.992 --> 01:34:19.993
Thank you.

1287
01:34:21.078 --> 01:34:22.204
Thank you.

1288
01:34:36.134 --> 01:34:40.138
Mr. Kind-love.
that was impressive.

1289
01:34:40.973 --> 01:34:42.015
I'm honored.

1290
01:34:42.933 --> 01:34:47.104
Clearly. you are. uh. very coachable.

1291
01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.024
Herb. Thank you.

1292
01:34:51.108 --> 01:34:52.276
Nice job. Joe.

1293
01:35:04.621 --> 01:35:06.707
{\an8}Joe amable-amo. I gotta tell you.

1294
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:09.084
{\an8}I'm paid to know what to say
in these situations.

1295
01:35:09.168 --> 01:35:12.546
{\an8}Right now. I'm at a loss.
Can you just tell me this?

1296
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:14.131
Are you a religious man. Joe?

1297
01:35:14.756 --> 01:35:16.425
I am a disciple of al.

1298
01:35:17.092 --> 01:35:18.092
"Al"?

1299
01:35:18.677 --> 01:35:20.971
The almighty lord. God.

1300
01:35:21.054 --> 01:35:23.098
I know you can't accept
the runner-up check.

1301
01:35:23.182 --> 01:35:25.517
but what are you gonna do
with all the endorsements?

1302
01:35:25.601 --> 01:35:27.601
What are you gonna do with those
that may cause you

1303
01:35:27.644 --> 01:35:30.606
to put in a dozen phone lines or so
in that bank in new Mexico?

1304
01:35:31.315 --> 01:35:34.151
Something very selfish.
I'm gonna give it all away.

1305
01:35:36.612 --> 01:35:38.739
- Congratulations on everything.
- Thank you.

1306
01:35:38.822 --> 01:35:41.533
Archie? A heroic victory for you.

1307
01:35:41.617 --> 01:35:44.870
Gutsy maybe. not heroic.

1308
01:35:45.704 --> 01:35:49.249
A hero is someone that gives himself up
for the benefit of others.

1309
01:35:50.667 --> 01:35:53.253
Gentlemen. you gave us
a once-in-a-lifetime show.

1310
01:35:53.337 --> 01:35:55.047
Thank you!

1311
01:35:55.130 --> 01:35:56.381
<i>You did it. so I believe it.</i>

1312
01:35:56.465 --> 01:35:58.217
When you were a kid.

1313
01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.427
your old man was a
pretty doggone good golfer.

1314
01:36:00.511 --> 01:36:04.598
Hey! He still is a pretty
doggone good golfer.

1315
01:36:05.724 --> 01:36:06.808
Whoa!

1316
01:36:07.726 --> 01:36:09.853
So. I think I know who you are.

1317
01:36:09.937 --> 01:36:11.480
I'm pretty sure that you do.

1318
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:21.114
I know. Sandy and I are headed
to North Korea. yeah.

1319
01:36:21.198 --> 01:36:25.619
Yeah. to deliver a message
to someone there of human compassion.

1320
01:36:25.702 --> 01:36:26.828
- Oh. man.
- Yeah.

1321
01:36:26.912 --> 01:36:28.830
There you go. He is so good.

1322
01:36:28.914 --> 01:36:30.234
- Thanks for watching him.
- Sure.

1323
01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.168
Hold out your hand.

1324
01:36:37.339 --> 01:36:38.549
Oh!

1325
01:36:40.551 --> 01:36:41.927
Thanks. Sheila.

1326
01:36:44.179 --> 01:36:45.222
Hold out your hand.

1327
01:36:51.562 --> 01:36:52.729
For the baby.

1328
01:36:52.813 --> 01:36:54.648
- Oh!
- For the...

1329
01:36:54.731 --> 01:36:57.025
Oh. she's gonna be so happy!

1330
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:58.777
In time to come.

1331
01:36:58.861 --> 01:37:01.029
Excuse me. You have a...

1332
01:37:04.783 --> 01:37:07.077
I guess this is goodbye.

1333
01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:10.497
It's not goodbye. You know what?
Al didn't give you full disclosure.

1334
01:37:10.581 --> 01:37:12.291
Job's not done yet. Joe.

1335
01:37:12.374 --> 01:37:15.752
You're gonna be delivering this message
for the rest of your life.

1336
01:37:16.712 --> 01:37:18.755
I wouldn't have it any other way.

1337
01:37:20.257 --> 01:37:21.967
You and I will see each other again.

1338
01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:25.804
I love you.

1339
01:37:26.471 --> 01:37:27.556
Thank you.

1340
01:37:37.733 --> 01:37:39.067
I'm proud of you. buddy.

1341
01:37:39.151 --> 01:37:40.569
Thank you.

1342
01:37:48.702 --> 01:37:50.037
Come on. honey.

1343
01:37:55.334 --> 01:37:57.753
Hey. everyone. Uh...

1344
01:37:57.836 --> 01:37:59.588
You know my wife. Camille.

1345
01:38:00.756 --> 01:38:03.258
Hi. We met on the course.

1346
01:38:08.305 --> 01:38:10.307
I feel like I know each of you.

1347
01:38:11.391 --> 01:38:13.560
Your love for each other is beautiful.

1348
01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:19.358
Your support and your faith
in your husband is beautiful.

1349
01:38:20.692 --> 01:38:24.947
Joe. Mrs. Amable-amo. I'm no hero.

1350
01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.993
But your daughter. Audrey? She is.

1351
01:38:51.098 --> 01:38:53.851
"Pay to the order of jardin del sol.

1352
01:38:53.934 --> 01:38:57.020
Signed. Archibald borthwick."

1353
01:38:57.104 --> 01:38:59.481
I hope I spelled it right.

1354
01:38:59.565 --> 01:39:01.024
Yes. you spelled it right!

1355
01:39:02.067 --> 01:39:05.153
How can we ever... ever thank you?

1356
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:08.198
Thank you. Joe.

1357
01:39:10.951 --> 01:39:11.952
Thank you.

1358
01:39:20.252 --> 01:39:23.046
Let's go home.
We have a lot to do.

1359
01:39:23.672 --> 01:39:25.007
Oh my god!

1360
01:39:25.090 --> 01:39:27.176
Your garden's going to be overrun.

1361
01:39:36.059 --> 01:39:37.436
Sponge cake!
