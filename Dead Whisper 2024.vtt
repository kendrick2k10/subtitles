3
00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:53.354
Yes? Hello?

4
00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:57.026
Okay.

5
00:00:59.028 --> 00:01:00.194
No.

6
00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:06.367
What do you mean he hasn't
been to work in two days?

7
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.639
I don't understand.

8
00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:12.775
I called his sister
two months ago.

9
00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:14.075
I said I was concerned.

10
00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:21.382
You're telling me no one's
gone to check on him.

11
00:01:23.586 --> 00:01:24.753
Yep.

12
00:01:26.722 --> 00:01:28.557
I'll head over now.

13
00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:32.460
Yep. I'll let you know.

14
00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.330
Jackson?

15
00:03:04.553 --> 00:03:05.854
Hello?

16
00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:30.873
Jackson?

17
00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.540
How far out are you going today?

18
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.345
Far.

19
00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:52.281
We'll be back in port
by tomorrow morning.

20
00:06:55.284 --> 00:06:57.286
You want to trade places?

21
00:07:00.956 --> 00:07:02.257
I can't.

22
00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:03.525
Why?

23
00:07:03.558 --> 00:07:05.861
The bar exam.

24
00:07:05.894 --> 00:07:09.097
The bar exam. Darn.

25
00:07:13.434 --> 00:07:15.671
Oh. it'll be good for you.

26
00:07:15.704 --> 00:07:17.139
Hmm? What?

27
00:07:19.741 --> 00:07:20.909
To put a suit on again.

28
00:09:15.924 --> 00:09:18.060
You still want to trade places?

29
00:09:18.093 --> 00:09:19.961
Well. there's a lot
out there I don't know about.

30
00:09:19.995 --> 00:09:21.196
so land is just fine.

31
00:09:32.074 --> 00:09:34.209
I want to talk to you
about something.

32
00:09:34.242 --> 00:09:35.710
Okay. What's that?

33
00:09:37.746 --> 00:09:41.083
I haven't really
given up on the idea of...

34
00:09:42.717 --> 00:09:44.186
Of what?

35
00:09:49.758 --> 00:09:50.926
Trying again.

36
00:09:57.032 --> 00:09:59.768
Elliot? What do you think?

37
00:10:06.608 --> 00:10:08.076
I don't want to replace her.

38
00:10:49.317 --> 00:10:50.620
Mr. Campbell?

39
00:10:59.194 --> 00:11:00.530
Mr. Campbell?

40
00:11:02.197 --> 00:11:03.431
Uh...

41
00:11:03.465 --> 00:11:04.666
I'm sorry.

42
00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:07.435
Could you say that again?

43
00:11:07.469 --> 00:11:10.472
Wouldn't you fight?
Fight for your child?

44
00:11:16.378 --> 00:11:20.148
Yes. Well. I'll need to do some
digging of my own

45
00:11:20.182 --> 00:11:21.750
and go over these--

46
00:11:21.783 --> 00:11:23.985
These documents
that you gathered.

47
00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:25.787
I don't understand.

48
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.857
You're considering
not taking us on?

49
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.360
Well. I'm... I'm weighing
the strength of the case.

50
00:11:32.394 --> 00:11:34.696
If you give me time to do that.
then I can give you an answer.

51
00:11:34.729 --> 00:11:36.498
Strength of the case?

52
00:11:36.532 --> 00:11:38.700
Do you understand
what we've been through?

53
00:11:38.733 --> 00:11:40.068
What we've lost?

54
00:11:41.637 --> 00:11:44.172
It was a poor choice of words.

55
00:11:44.206 --> 00:11:47.342
I'm just explaining
that it's a process.

56
00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:49.612
We took
a two-and-a-half-hour-long

57
00:11:49.645 --> 00:11:51.146
ferry ride from Nantucket

58
00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:52.380
to make this meeting.

59
00:11:53.481 --> 00:11:55.016
I-I know you did.

60
00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.852
Gavin shaped this out
to be a certain thing.

61
00:11:59.555 --> 00:12:02.324
If he did say that.
then he overstated.

62
00:12:02.357 --> 00:12:05.227
He also said you were
the best personal injury lawyer

63
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.828
Cape Cod had to offer.

64
00:12:06.861 --> 00:12:08.363
"The man for the job."

65
00:12:08.396 --> 00:12:09.665
Did he overstate that too?

66
00:12:09.699 --> 00:12:12.834
Mr. Reynolds. Mrs. Reynolds.

67
00:12:12.867 --> 00:12:15.538
I think that we have just gotten
off on the wrong foot here.

68
00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:17.640
Oh...
Jameson...

69
00:12:17.673 --> 00:12:19.741
It's a damn waste of time.

70
00:12:19.774 --> 00:12:21.544
Come on.

71
00:12:21.577 --> 00:12:22.978
Let me at least get
the door for you.

72
00:12:23.011 --> 00:12:25.413
No. no. that's quite all right.

73
00:14:34.643 --> 00:14:36.444
I stuck my neck out
for you. Elliot.

74
00:14:36.478 --> 00:14:38.012
You said you were back
to yourself.

75
00:14:38.046 --> 00:14:39.280
I know I did.

76
00:14:39.314 --> 00:14:40.850
The Reynolds are very upset

77
00:14:40.882 --> 00:14:42.183
about that meeting.

78
00:14:42.217 --> 00:14:43.519
I wouldn't have
sent them your way

79
00:14:43.552 --> 00:14:44.854
if it meant bruising
my reputation.

80
00:14:44.919 --> 00:14:46.121
Gavin. I will--

81
00:14:46.154 --> 00:14:47.355
I'll make it right.

82
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:48.957
And how's that?

83
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.860
By drowning yourself
in a bottle

84
00:14:50.892 --> 00:14:52.628
and waking up in a cold sweat?

85
00:14:52.661 --> 00:14:54.329
Look at you.

86
00:14:55.664 --> 00:14:57.065
I can help them.

87
00:14:57.098 --> 00:14:58.834
You could.

88
00:15:05.508 --> 00:15:07.342
You could.

89
00:15:09.444 --> 00:15:12.080
But man. we both know
you are a damn good lawyer.

90
00:15:14.015 --> 00:15:18.521
Not the person I used to be.

91
00:15:24.459 --> 00:15:28.831
The night you found
Willow and you called me.

92
00:15:28.864 --> 00:15:30.465
Willow!

93
00:15:31.634 --> 00:15:33.268
<i>I rushed over.</i>

94
00:15:33.301 --> 00:15:34.703
I could see
then what it did to you.

95
00:15:34.737 --> 00:15:37.305
what it would do to you.

96
00:15:40.442 --> 00:15:42.511
<i>Despite what's happened.</i>
<i>there are things in this world</i>

97
00:15:42.545 --> 00:15:44.379
that you have to come back to.

98
00:15:45.581 --> 00:15:47.817
Hell. even look forward to.

99
00:15:50.118 --> 00:15:51.953
Maybe that's not what I want.

100
00:15:53.589 --> 00:15:55.123
To be happy?

101
00:16:00.729 --> 00:16:02.598
You don't understand.

102
00:16:03.833 --> 00:16:05.601
Then help me.

103
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:16.579
This...

104
00:16:21.449 --> 00:16:24.285
this pain that I have with me.

105
00:16:30.826 --> 00:16:33.328
I mean. that's all
that I have left of her.

106
00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:44.372
Elliot. please...

107
00:16:52.882 --> 00:16:54.148
don't bury yourself.

108
00:18:34.282 --> 00:18:35.551
Hey. Elliot!

109
00:18:36.785 --> 00:18:38.787
Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

110
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.165
<i>Hello?</i>

111
00:19:56.197 --> 00:19:58.667
<i>Hello? Uh. Mrs. Reynolds?</i>

112
00:19:58.701 --> 00:20:00.368
<i>Is that you?</i>

113
00:20:00.401 --> 00:20:03.005
This is. um...
This is Elliot Campbell.

114
00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:04.238
<i>This is she.</i>

115
00:20:06.075 --> 00:20:07.475
Well. I think I...

116
00:20:07.509 --> 00:20:08.711
I owe you an apology.

117
00:20:10.244 --> 00:20:12.213
Um...

118
00:20:12.246 --> 00:20:14.282
The other day when you were--
You were in here.

119
00:20:14.315 --> 00:20:16.151
in my office and...

120
00:20:18.352 --> 00:20:20.522
My behavior was unacceptable.

121
00:20:23.257 --> 00:20:25.994
To be totally honest.
I mean. you just--

122
00:20:26.028 --> 00:20:29.230
You caught me at a bad time.

123
00:20:29.263 --> 00:20:31.332
Um. I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

124
00:20:32.433 --> 00:20:33.669
<i>Thank you for the apology.</i>

125
00:20:33.702 --> 00:20:36.337
Of course. of course.

126
00:20:37.873 --> 00:20:39.074
<i>Mr. Campbell...</i>

127
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:42.578
Yes?

128
00:20:42.611 --> 00:20:44.713
<i>We would be honored</i>
<i>to have you represent us.</i>

129
00:20:47.583 --> 00:20:49.985
Really? That's so great to hear.

130
00:20:50.018 --> 00:20:51.220
<i>Good.</i>

131
00:20:51.252 --> 00:20:52.688
<i>So you'll accept the case?</i>

132
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:55.356
Yes. yes. yes. Absolutely.

133
00:20:57.192 --> 00:20:59.327
And if you have
anything for me.

134
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.263
feel free to fax it over here
to my office.

135
00:21:02.296 --> 00:21:04.099
<i>We can do that.</i>

136
00:21:04.133 --> 00:21:05.366
Great.

137
00:21:05.399 --> 00:21:06.835
<i>Have a good day. Mr. Campbell.</i>

138
00:21:06.869 --> 00:21:08.336
Goodbye.

139
00:22:06.261 --> 00:22:07.529
How in the world?

140
00:24:15.824 --> 00:24:18.393
Oh. what?
What is it? Are you all right?

141
00:24:19.628 --> 00:24:21.596
What? Yes. I'm fine. Are you?

142
00:24:25.334 --> 00:24:27.035
Why-- Why do you ask?

143
00:24:27.069 --> 00:24:28.737
You were having some
sort of nightmare.

144
00:24:30.806 --> 00:24:33.108
Nightmare?
Yeah.

145
00:24:33.141 --> 00:24:36.445
No. no. no.
I wasn't having a nightmare.

146
00:24:40.615 --> 00:24:42.017
I was...

147
00:24:43.819 --> 00:24:45.354
dreaming about...

148
00:24:47.823 --> 00:24:50.625
some place.

149
00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:54.262
It's like an...

150
00:24:57.332 --> 00:24:58.867
oasis or something.

151
00:25:00.135 --> 00:25:02.704
What do you mean an oasis?

152
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.943
I don't know. It was just...

153
00:25:10.812 --> 00:25:12.381
It was beautiful.

154
00:25:15.217 --> 00:25:17.119
And Willow was...

155
00:25:22.357 --> 00:25:24.192
Willow was there.

156
00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:02.324
And he is not wearing
the state-mandated life jacket.

157
00:27:06.596 --> 00:27:07.896
He liked...

158
00:27:08.964 --> 00:27:10.198
Well. he liked sailing so...

159
00:27:15.337 --> 00:27:16.506
...put on the life jacket.

160
00:28:09.057 --> 00:28:11.092
...local police.

161
00:28:19.234 --> 00:28:20.670
Threat to the...

162
00:30:34.469 --> 00:30:35.705
Hello?

163
00:30:37.939 --> 00:30:40.175
<i>Elliot. Is it you?</i>

164
00:30:41.343 --> 00:30:42.511
Gavin?

165
00:30:43.646 --> 00:30:45.480
How did you know I was here?

166
00:30:46.716 --> 00:30:48.116
<i>Something isn't right. Elliot.</i>

167
00:30:49.351 --> 00:30:51.353
<i>Can't you see that?</i>

168
00:30:51.386 --> 00:30:53.154
What's-- What's not right?

169
00:30:53.188 --> 00:30:55.090
<i>You have to go now.</i>

170
00:30:55.123 --> 00:30:57.125
<i>You have to handle</i>
<i>the situation at hand.</i>

171
00:30:57.158 --> 00:30:58.794
Go where?

172
00:30:58.828 --> 00:31:00.295
<i>You have to see her.</i>

173
00:31:01.664 --> 00:31:04.132
Is this about the case?

174
00:31:04.165 --> 00:31:06.000
<i>I only want to help you.</i>

175
00:31:06.034 --> 00:31:08.370
<i>I just want</i>
<i>to give you purpose.</i>

176
00:31:08.403 --> 00:31:10.138
I-I-I don't--

177
00:31:10.171 --> 00:31:14.309
I don't understand
what you're asking me to--

178
00:31:14.342 --> 00:31:16.211
To visit the Reynolds?

179
00:31:16.244 --> 00:31:18.514
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

180
00:31:18.547 --> 00:31:20.248
<i>Yes. you should go.</i>

181
00:31:22.484 --> 00:31:24.185
Look. look. um...

182
00:31:25.387 --> 00:31:27.489
I think. um...

183
00:31:27.523 --> 00:31:29.859
Let's. uh... let's get together

184
00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:31.827
and talk about this
in person. okay?

185
00:31:31.861 --> 00:31:33.161
<i>Get together?</i>

186
00:31:34.563 --> 00:31:35.731
Yeah.

187
00:31:36.832 --> 00:31:37.999
Meet somewhere.

188
00:31:39.901 --> 00:31:42.505
<i>Yes. let's meet</i>
<i>at the Shipwreck Lounge.</i>

189
00:31:42.538 --> 00:31:44.707
<i>just off the pier's main drag.</i>

190
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.142
Uh. okay.

191
00:31:47.175 --> 00:31:49.010
When do you want to meet?

192
00:31:51.246 --> 00:31:52.715
Gavin?

193
00:33:58.707 --> 00:34:00.441
Correct me if I'm wrong. son.

194
00:34:00.475 --> 00:34:04.547
but it appears you require
the comfort of a stiff drink.

195
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:10.686
I'm sorry.
Do we know each other?

196
00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.888
I couldn't say.

197
00:34:12.922 --> 00:34:14.422
The name's Porter.

198
00:34:14.455 --> 00:34:15.925
Does that sound familiar?

199
00:34:18.561 --> 00:34:20.896
No. I-I guess not.

200
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:22.898
What about your name?

201
00:34:26.602 --> 00:34:28.037
Elliot Campbell.

202
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:30.573
You are the local lawyer.
aren't you?

203
00:34:30.606 --> 00:34:33.141
Yeah. that's me.

204
00:34:33.174 --> 00:34:35.644
This is a quaint community.

205
00:34:35.678 --> 00:34:39.615
I've had a delightful time
familiarizing myself with it.

206
00:34:42.417 --> 00:34:44.687
You're not from here?

207
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.589
I mean. to be honest. I...

208
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:50.826
I only had ever
heard of this place

209
00:34:50.859 --> 00:34:52.695
for the first time tonight.

210
00:34:53.796 --> 00:34:55.664
The Shipwreck Lounge.

211
00:34:55.698 --> 00:34:57.398
Yeah.

212
00:34:57.432 --> 00:34:58.701
The original
establishment closed

213
00:34:58.734 --> 00:35:01.369
when its founder
was lost at sea.

214
00:35:01.402 --> 00:35:03.072
You see. I changed the name.

215
00:35:03.104 --> 00:35:06.842
Good humor. bad taste.

216
00:35:06.875 --> 00:35:11.680
Boulevardier
is a divine beverage.

217
00:35:11.714 --> 00:35:16.051
and I think it's the perfect
aperitif for you.

218
00:35:38.741 --> 00:35:41.076
When you took a seat at my bar.

219
00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:44.913
I saw something that a man in
my profession sees all the time.

220
00:35:47.516 --> 00:35:48.984
What?

221
00:35:49.018 --> 00:35:52.721
An unrelenting weight
on your shoulders.

222
00:35:52.755 --> 00:35:55.924
the kind that cripples
a good person.

223
00:36:01.764 --> 00:36:04.633
The woman that was sitting
down there. she was my--

224
00:36:04.667 --> 00:36:06.035
No need to explain.

225
00:36:07.468 --> 00:36:08.804
As proprietor here.

226
00:36:08.837 --> 00:36:11.573
I see all the comings
and goings.

227
00:36:11.607 --> 00:36:13.307
I probably need another one.

228
00:36:15.144 --> 00:36:19.581
Well. then. an establishment
like this is not conducive

229
00:36:19.615 --> 00:36:22.216
to a man with your condition.

230
00:36:24.285 --> 00:36:26.454
Been trying to beat it.

231
00:36:26.487 --> 00:36:28.289
You'll beat it.

232
00:36:28.322 --> 00:36:29.490
I'm sure of it.

233
00:36:30.993 --> 00:36:32.293
Word of advice:

234
00:36:32.326 --> 00:36:33.862
take a trip.

235
00:36:33.896 --> 00:36:37.231
Someplace away
from all these distractions.

236
00:36:41.003 --> 00:36:43.072
A trip?

237
00:36:43.105 --> 00:36:45.808
Yes. Sail away. if you will.

238
00:36:49.545 --> 00:36:51.647
I may have to...

239
00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.717
I may have to go
to Nantucket for business.

240
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:58.987
It's this important
case that I'm working.

241
00:36:59.021 --> 00:37:00.556
How perfect.

242
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:03.892
An opportunity
to distance yourself

243
00:37:03.926 --> 00:37:07.563
and confront this burden
that you carry.

244
00:37:10.899 --> 00:37:12.968
Yeah. Yeah.

245
00:37:13.001 --> 00:37:15.303
It is an opportunity.
isn't it?

246
00:37:15.336 --> 00:37:16.505
Mr. Campbell?

247
00:37:18.272 --> 00:37:20.042
Elliot.

248
00:37:20.075 --> 00:37:24.479
Are you willing
to commit this journey

249
00:37:24.513 --> 00:37:26.247
right here.

250
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.516
right now?

251
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:37.659
I'm not sure. uh...

252
00:37:37.693 --> 00:37:40.729
Would it not benefit you
to rest with some clarity.

253
00:37:40.763 --> 00:37:44.900
knowing that tomorrow
will be a different day...

254
00:37:46.602 --> 00:37:48.203
a different time.

255
00:37:48.237 --> 00:37:49.738
a different place.

256
00:37:51.573 --> 00:37:52.741
Yeah.

257
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.981
So we are in agreement then?

258
00:38:06.454 --> 00:38:07.689
Hmm.

259
00:38:07.723 --> 00:38:10.092
On that note...

260
00:38:12.761 --> 00:38:14.163
...you've made the right
decision. son.

261
00:38:15.564 --> 00:38:19.134
Yeah. yeah. I think so.

262
00:38:19.168 --> 00:38:20.636
A toast...

263
00:38:22.971 --> 00:38:25.808
to getting away from it all.

264
00:38:25.841 --> 00:38:27.576
To getting away
from it all.

265
00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.641
Hello?

266
00:44:10.118 --> 00:44:12.988
With me-- With me-- With me...

267
00:45:57.025 --> 00:45:58.293
Where am I?

268
00:46:02.632 --> 00:46:04.199
What exactly is it
you're doing?

269
00:46:08.803 --> 00:46:11.039
Making the root.

270
00:46:12.974 --> 00:46:16.778
The many questions
you must have. my dear boy.

271
00:46:16.811 --> 00:46:20.382
All of which will be answered
in due time.

272
00:46:21.717 --> 00:46:23.051
The root.

273
00:46:23.084 --> 00:46:25.787
It's a native plant
to our island.

274
00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.789
It can be used
for medicinal purposes.

275
00:46:29.457 --> 00:46:31.126
You're...

276
00:46:31.159 --> 00:46:33.261
You're the bartender
from the Shipwreck Lounge.

277
00:46:33.295 --> 00:46:35.864
I'm afraid you have me
mistaken for someone else.

278
00:46:35.897 --> 00:46:38.266
I am the Historian.

279
00:46:39.769 --> 00:46:41.036
But I--

280
00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:42.538
Burdened by a sense
of confusion.

281
00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:44.039
Not to worry.

282
00:46:44.072 --> 00:46:46.374
It's a common symptom
for those who trek

283
00:46:46.408 --> 00:46:47.610
through the island dunes.

284
00:46:47.643 --> 00:46:51.146
Our root carries a pungent odor.

285
00:46:51.179 --> 00:46:55.250
When inhaled. its side effects
can be hallucinatory.

286
00:46:56.318 --> 00:46:58.654
The symptoms will fade in time.

287
00:47:00.322 --> 00:47:02.457
Any good practitioner
of the trait will tell you

288
00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:05.060
that history is written
by the victors.

289
00:47:05.093 --> 00:47:06.529
And you would be wise to listen.

290
00:47:07.862 --> 00:47:10.733
My collection. however.

291
00:47:10.766 --> 00:47:13.335
keeps a record
of the forgotten.

292
00:47:16.271 --> 00:47:18.106
I've lived on the cape
my entire life

293
00:47:18.139 --> 00:47:23.546
and seen every lighthouse
from Monomoy...

294
00:47:25.013 --> 00:47:26.348
to Woods End.

295
00:47:28.116 --> 00:47:30.653
But this place. I mean.

296
00:47:30.686 --> 00:47:33.689
I've never seen anything
like this place.

297
00:47:33.723 --> 00:47:36.792
Ah. the sea is a veil
for many secrets.

298
00:47:36.826 --> 00:47:38.794
Few are privy.

299
00:47:38.828 --> 00:47:40.629
How did you come to be here?

300
00:47:41.863 --> 00:47:44.700
Did Elise not enlighten you?

301
00:47:44.734 --> 00:47:46.935
She was brief.

302
00:47:48.203 --> 00:47:50.506
My fascinations
required a convent

303
00:47:50.539 --> 00:47:52.874
to conceal the work
from prying eyes.

304
00:47:52.907 --> 00:47:58.714
So I set sail. only to land
on these sacred grounds.

305
00:47:58.748 --> 00:48:00.281
I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry.

306
00:48:00.315 --> 00:48:03.719
but are you saying
that you discovered this place?

307
00:48:05.721 --> 00:48:07.222
Flattering. but. um.

308
00:48:07.255 --> 00:48:10.659
things do not live and die
by our field of vision.

309
00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.663
Although. I will concede

310
00:48:14.697 --> 00:48:18.032
that my greatest pride
is being the first face

311
00:48:18.066 --> 00:48:19.869
this island every saw.

312
00:48:23.338 --> 00:48:26.975
Look. I have an important case
in Nantucket tomorrow.

313
00:48:27.008 --> 00:48:28.544
I need arrangements made.

314
00:48:28.577 --> 00:48:30.912
Yes. well.
I've taken the liberty

315
00:48:30.945 --> 00:48:33.948
of placing a call
to Chief Mate G. Wick Smithsman.

316
00:48:35.751 --> 00:48:37.586
There'll be a private
charter here to relieve you

317
00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.054
of this inconvenience
before nightfall.

318
00:48:41.122 --> 00:48:42.390
Okay.

319
00:48:42.424 --> 00:48:45.026
Like the old saying.

320
00:48:45.059 --> 00:48:47.663
oceans are big.
compasses are small.

321
00:48:47.696 --> 00:48:51.966
and a man without knack for
direction has nothing at all.

322
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:58.406
I'm sorry. uh.
who said that exactly?

323
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.677
Sits with you. does it?
A guest of mine.

324
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:02.944
Do you have many guests here?

325
00:49:02.977 --> 00:49:04.145
That reminds me.

326
00:49:11.654 --> 00:49:14.590
Would you sign your name for me?

327
00:49:14.623 --> 00:49:17.827
It's vital that I keep
a record of all our guests.

328
00:49:20.228 --> 00:49:22.263
I'm really. uh. no guest.

329
00:49:23.766 --> 00:49:27.101
Anyone who sets foot
in my home is my guest.

330
00:49:30.673 --> 00:49:32.908
Hmm.

331
00:49:32.942 --> 00:49:34.610
I understand.

332
00:49:34.643 --> 00:49:36.579
A lawyer doesn't
put pen to paper

333
00:49:36.612 --> 00:49:39.447
unless he produces the page.

334
00:49:42.317 --> 00:49:44.553
Sorry. how do you know
that I'm--

335
00:49:44.587 --> 00:49:46.655
I tend to not listen to
the mutterings of a subdued man.

336
00:49:46.689 --> 00:49:48.156
But yours...

337
00:49:48.189 --> 00:49:51.059
Far too interesting to ignore.

338
00:49:51.092 --> 00:49:56.431
Ah. I hope you do not
pass judgment

339
00:49:56.464 --> 00:49:58.233
on early indulgences.

340
00:49:58.266 --> 00:50:00.569
No. no. of course not.

341
00:50:00.603 --> 00:50:02.437
My favorite beverage
as of late.

342
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:03.806
It's a...
Boulevardier?

343
00:50:05.875 --> 00:50:09.778
I like to save the liquored ice.

344
00:50:09.812 --> 00:50:13.448
There can be good use
in often discarded things.

345
00:50:19.989 --> 00:50:22.156
Wait. Elise.

346
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:23.893
We must get him one.

347
00:50:23.926 --> 00:50:26.261
No. no. that's. that's fine.

348
00:50:26.294 --> 00:50:28.029
My boy!

349
00:50:28.062 --> 00:50:29.865
You've got hours to spare.

350
00:50:29.899 --> 00:50:31.065
In fact...

351
00:50:34.003 --> 00:50:36.005
take mine.

352
00:50:36.037 --> 00:50:39.642
As I told you before.
you are my guest.

353
00:50:58.527 --> 00:51:00.563
Oh! Oh. thank you. Thank you.

354
00:51:05.834 --> 00:51:07.135
Okay. Where was I? Right.

355
00:51:07.168 --> 00:51:08.403
Oh. oh.

356
00:51:08.436 --> 00:51:10.305
So my dad says. before--

357
00:51:10.338 --> 00:51:13.174
Before we even get
into the boat. he says.

358
00:51:13.207 --> 00:51:15.176
"Go against the current."

359
00:51:16.277 --> 00:51:17.813
He was a very stern guy.

360
00:51:17.846 --> 00:51:20.983
Probably told us several times.
but here we come.

361
00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:24.352
So-- So I push us off the rocks

362
00:51:24.385 --> 00:51:27.155
and then the kayak
already starts to turn.

363
00:51:27.188 --> 00:51:29.190
And we've got
the current just...

364
00:51:29.223 --> 00:51:31.326
You know? Right up against
our side like that.

365
00:51:31.359 --> 00:51:34.730
And before you know it.
we've done a whole 180 spin.

366
00:51:34.763 --> 00:51:35.931
And...

367
00:51:37.967 --> 00:51:40.368
she's screaming.
and I'm laughing

368
00:51:40.401 --> 00:51:41.604
because we're going backwards.

369
00:51:41.637 --> 00:51:45.239
So then. you know. we flip.

370
00:51:47.141 --> 00:51:48.476
Hmm.

371
00:51:50.111 --> 00:51:52.948
She falls in and she's...
she's panicking.

372
00:51:52.982 --> 00:51:54.282
She's terrified.

373
00:51:54.315 --> 00:51:55.985
We didn't have life jackets on.

374
00:51:57.485 --> 00:52:01.122
And so she starts thrashing
her arms around.

375
00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:04.026
Clocks me.

376
00:52:04.059 --> 00:52:05.259
Cracks me right here
in the nose.

377
00:52:06.762 --> 00:52:08.396
Yeah. but. um...

378
00:52:10.799 --> 00:52:12.166
saved her life.

379
00:52:13.569 --> 00:52:15.104
How?

380
00:52:18.741 --> 00:52:23.012
Well. I told her...

381
00:52:25.748 --> 00:52:26.915
"Stand up."

382
00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:30.552
Because we were
in 4 feet of water.

383
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:36.592
Quite the punch line.

384
00:52:38.093 --> 00:52:39.528
Stand up.

385
00:52:43.464 --> 00:52:44.933
It's funny how time flies
like that.

386
00:52:46.669 --> 00:52:47.970
Speaking of time...

387
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:50.806
No. that can't be right.

388
00:52:53.274 --> 00:52:55.844
Says that it's 10:30 at night.

389
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.890
You must tell me more
about this woman. Dottie.

390
00:53:13.629 --> 00:53:17.432
Ahem. we-- We. uh...
we married young.

391
00:53:17.465 --> 00:53:19.635
We were high school sweethearts.

392
00:53:19.668 --> 00:53:22.470
And I trust
all is in good standing?

393
00:53:27.576 --> 00:53:29.011
Actually. I. um...

394
00:53:32.081 --> 00:53:33.849
I saw her at a bar
with someone else.

395
00:53:35.517 --> 00:53:36.852
That is peculiar.

396
00:53:36.885 --> 00:53:39.021
And how did you see her?

397
00:53:41.557 --> 00:53:43.692
I followed her.

398
00:53:43.726 --> 00:53:45.359
No.

399
00:53:45.393 --> 00:53:46.829
I mean how?

400
00:53:47.996 --> 00:53:49.430
They were being...

401
00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:53.736
physical.

402
00:53:53.769 --> 00:53:55.838
Hmm. Physical.

403
00:53:57.606 --> 00:54:00.408
Dare I say carnal in nature?

404
00:54:07.082 --> 00:54:09.250
Bless your soul.

405
00:54:09.283 --> 00:54:12.221
Though in many ways.

406
00:54:12.253 --> 00:54:13.956
it is a fitting conclusion.

407
00:54:15.524 --> 00:54:17.593
What do you mean?

408
00:54:17.626 --> 00:54:19.293
Only from what you mentioned.

409
00:54:20.929 --> 00:54:22.531
About your baby.

410
00:54:30.873 --> 00:54:32.306
I told you that?

411
00:54:33.942 --> 00:54:35.744
You told me everything.

412
00:54:44.887 --> 00:54:46.320
That's right.

413
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:49.758
I used to be a dad.

414
00:54:49.792 --> 00:54:52.795
A father. a husband. a son.

415
00:54:54.328 --> 00:54:55.564
Just words.

416
00:54:55.597 --> 00:54:57.866
Have very little meaning here.

417
00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:59.268
Don't...

418
00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:04.740
Do not be wary of what
you confide in me. Elliot.

419
00:55:04.773 --> 00:55:08.811
I... I believe we share
a covenant of sorts.

420
00:55:17.119 --> 00:55:20.421
I apologize.
but I must momentarily

421
00:55:20.454 --> 00:55:23.826
excuse myself
from our delightful discussion.

422
00:55:25.093 --> 00:55:26.728
Is everything all right?

423
00:55:26.762 --> 00:55:28.063
Why. yes.

424
00:55:28.096 --> 00:55:31.499
Everything is exactly
as it should be.

425
00:58:41.523 --> 00:58:42.758
Elise?

426
00:59:37.312 --> 00:59:41.416
I do regret the
manner
of your arrival. Elliot.

427
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:46.755
It was unkind for you
to be abandoned to the dunes.

428
00:59:46.788 --> 00:59:51.026
Know that I will speak with
your guide about this debacle.

429
00:59:51.059 --> 00:59:53.061
Enough lies!

430
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:55.964
You drugged me.

431
01:00:08.276 --> 01:00:11.947
Do you think I wish to hurt you?

432
01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:15.217
Oh. that saddens me.

433
01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:16.852
What was in that drink?

434
01:00:16.885 --> 01:00:20.755
The root in its native
elixir perform many wonders.

435
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:23.758
Medicine. medicine. medicine.

436
01:00:23.792 --> 01:00:27.429
Sadly. the path through healing
is often riddled by pain.

437
01:00:29.097 --> 01:00:30.866
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!

438
01:00:30.899 --> 01:00:33.536
When you first arrived.
Elliot.

439
01:00:33.569 --> 01:00:37.372
I found you
bleeding into a stone.

440
01:00:37.405 --> 01:00:39.407
I was confused
by your hesitancy.

441
01:00:39.441 --> 01:00:43.211
for it was you
that called to me.

442
01:00:43.245 --> 01:00:45.747
No. no. no. no. I never wanted
anything from you!

443
01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:48.584
I turned to Elise
and even stated aloud.

444
01:00:48.618 --> 01:00:50.152
"This is not he.

445
01:00:50.185 --> 01:00:52.954
"The one we've so anxiously
been waiting.

446
01:00:52.988 --> 01:00:55.824
the one summoned
to join the fold."

447
01:00:58.994 --> 01:01:02.164
You brought me here.
You brought me here.

448
01:01:02.197 --> 01:01:04.132
You're the...

449
01:01:04.166 --> 01:01:06.334
You're the man
from the Shipwreck Lounge!

450
01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:10.805
A fish out water. eh?

451
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.644
I am the one
that plucked you out.

452
01:01:14.676 --> 01:01:18.813
But with commitment
and openness.

453
01:01:18.847 --> 01:01:21.683
you will find understanding.

454
01:01:21.716 --> 01:01:23.485
and a new home.

455
01:01:23.519 --> 01:01:26.622
here with your new family.

456
01:01:26.656 --> 01:01:28.990
like our darling Elise did.

457
01:01:29.024 --> 01:01:31.459
Stay back.

458
01:01:31.493 --> 01:01:33.195
I don't want
to have to hurt you.

459
01:01:33.228 --> 01:01:35.730
Elliot.

460
01:01:40.168 --> 01:01:44.540
When you cast that photograph
of dear Willow into the sea.

461
01:01:44.574 --> 01:01:48.476
you whispered a desire
I will not soon forget.

462
01:01:51.213 --> 01:01:52.548
My daughter is dead.

463
01:01:52.582 --> 01:01:56.051
Death is but a subject of time.

464
01:01:57.752 --> 01:02:01.323
This is a timeless place.
and I its keeper.

465
01:02:01.356 --> 01:02:04.159
Oh. you didn't die

466
01:02:04.192 --> 01:02:06.895
with the memory
of your child. Elliot.

467
01:02:09.264 --> 01:02:10.600
Come now.

468
01:02:12.535 --> 01:02:13.735
Come now and live by it.

469
01:02:39.928 --> 01:02:41.530
I'm sorry.

470
01:05:34.035 --> 01:05:35.437
What is it. my dear boy?

471
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:36.938
You mustn't say it.

472
01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:38.973
You must whisper it.

473
01:08:53.602 --> 01:08:55.771
Willow!

474
01:08:55.804 --> 01:08:58.107
Willow!

475
01:10:59.561 --> 01:11:00.796
Elliot?

476
01:11:48.777 --> 01:11:50.846
Why would you leave me
in here alone?

477
01:11:53.282 --> 01:11:54.917
Uh. I didn't.

478
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:57.519
I was with you
through all of it.

479
01:11:59.288 --> 01:12:01.790
But you left.

480
01:12:01.824 --> 01:12:03.324
You didn't come back.

481
01:12:08.797 --> 01:12:10.199
I never should have gone.

482
01:12:21.342 --> 01:12:25.314
Before you left it.
I had something to tell you.

483
01:12:25.346 --> 01:12:27.216
Something important.

484
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:31.887
Yes.
It's a secret.

485
01:12:33.188 --> 01:12:34.823
You can tell me now.

486
01:12:42.064 --> 01:12:44.333
I hear...

487
01:12:44.365 --> 01:12:46.367
everything.

488
01:13:03.051 --> 01:13:04.553
Dottie. Dottie. Dottie!

489
01:13:04.586 --> 01:13:06.889
Dottie. wait! Dottie. wait!

490
01:15:07.676 --> 01:15:08.844
Son.

491
01:15:10.946 --> 01:15:15.851
For years I would come here.
standing where you stand now.

492
01:15:15.884 --> 01:15:17.886
alluded by the thought
of my late mother.

493
01:15:19.354 --> 01:15:22.391
You see. time made
her distant from me.

494
01:15:23.859 --> 01:15:27.729
An entire life.
a history. washed away.

495
01:15:29.498 --> 01:15:31.900
Are you familiar
with that outcome?

496
01:15:34.002 --> 01:15:35.937
Yes.

497
01:15:35.971 --> 01:15:37.873
Give it a closer look.

498
01:15:43.412 --> 01:15:46.048
It's like I suddenly
just became so aware of...

499
01:15:46.081 --> 01:15:47.549
Our impermanence.

500
01:17:09.231 --> 01:17:11.133
Do you see now?

501
01:17:12.568 --> 01:17:14.537
Do you see now what happens

502
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:16.838
when you cease to exist?

503
01:17:18.907 --> 01:17:20.142
Nothing.

504
01:17:20.175 --> 01:17:21.409
Yes!

505
01:17:21.443 --> 01:17:24.312
You're abandoned to the sea.

506
01:17:28.483 --> 01:17:30.418
But they care very little.

507
01:17:30.452 --> 01:17:32.954
Out of sight. out of mind.

508
01:17:34.089 --> 01:17:35.457
Was it real?

509
01:17:39.027 --> 01:17:41.062
It was real.

510
01:17:41.096 --> 01:17:43.398
Only I have been there.

511
01:17:43.431 --> 01:17:47.969
an unbiased.
unrelenting presence.

512
01:17:48.003 --> 01:17:50.772
whispering in your ear

513
01:17:50.805 --> 01:17:54.276
from the time
you felt the darkness.

514
01:17:56.612 --> 01:17:58.180
What are you?

515
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:05.521
You've been adrift
for far too long. Elliot.

516
01:18:05.555 --> 01:18:09.958
And where the drowned
body rises.

517
01:18:09.991 --> 01:18:13.061
the soul is consumed
by the sea.

518
01:18:15.297 --> 01:18:16.666
I want to go back.

519
01:18:16.698 --> 01:18:19.000
I want to go back.
I want to go back!

520
01:18:19.034 --> 01:18:22.103
There is only one door
you can take.

521
01:18:22.137 --> 01:18:24.005
the one in which you entered.

522
01:18:25.073 --> 01:18:26.975
Please.

523
01:18:27.008 --> 01:18:28.843
Do not fret. my boy.

524
01:18:28.877 --> 01:18:32.214
I am here to give you purpose.

525
01:18:35.383 --> 01:18:38.153
I offer the familiarity

526
01:18:38.186 --> 01:18:40.523
you have strayed from.

527
01:18:40.556 --> 01:18:44.025
the comfort you have longed for.

528
01:18:44.059 --> 01:18:48.096
the mirror
you have sought to see!

529
01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.734
All you have to do
is take the key.

530
01:18:54.903 --> 01:19:00.576
I believe there is
a familiar face

531
01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:02.545
waiting for you.

532
01:19:03.613 --> 01:19:05.247
Familiar?

533
01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.102
My name. um...

534
01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.541
I seem to have
forgotten my name.

535
01:19:36.478 --> 01:19:37.647
On the contrary...

536
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:43.619
your name has just been added.

537
01:23:50.064 --> 01:23:51.366
It's okay.

538
01:23:56.005 --> 01:23:57.338
I love you so much.

539
01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:01.442
I love you so much. Willow.

540
01:24:01.476 --> 01:24:02.978
I'll never leave you again.

541
01:24:04.513 --> 01:24:06.015
I'll never leave you again.

542
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:09.618
I'm back.

543
01:24:09.652 --> 01:24:11.587
Daddy's here.
Daddy's here forever.

544
01:24:13.154 --> 01:24:14.523
Forever and ever.
