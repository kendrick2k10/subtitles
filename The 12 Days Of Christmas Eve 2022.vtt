3
00:00:15.537 --> 00:00:16.712
Can I try?

4
00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:21.630
Careful. It's hot.

5
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.240
OK. right there.

6
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:26.243
Right there.

7
00:00:26.374 --> 00:00:27.723
OK.

8
00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:34.730
Try again.

9
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.601
Don't give up.

10
00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:38.734
The only way to succeed
is with hard work.

11
00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:41.780
That-a boy.

12
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:43.565
All right. let's try.

13
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.962
Can we work
on the music box now?

14
00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:51.573
Not today.

15
00:00:51.703 --> 00:00:53.662
We have to go to Mrs. Martin's
house to fix her stove.

16
00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:55.446
But it's Christmas Eve.

17
00:00:55.577 --> 00:00:58.797
Exactly. which is why she's
paying extra for me to fix it.

18
00:00:58.928 --> 00:01:00.147
so she can cook
Christmas dinner tomorrow

19
00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:02.801
for her family.

20
00:01:02.932 --> 00:01:04.368
How do you think I paid
for all those gifts

21
00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:06.457
waiting for you under the tree?

22
00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:08.416
We have to earn our gifts
in life

23
00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:09.982
through hard work
and sacrifice.

24
00:01:10.113 --> 00:01:11.114
You understand?

25
00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:12.811
Yes. sir.

26
00:01:12.942 --> 00:01:14.639
I just--

27
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.556
I wish you didn't have to work
on Christmas Eve.

28
00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:22.430
I do all of this so you can
have a better life than me.

29
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.434
One day. you'll be
rich and successful.

30
00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:28.479
All your Christmas wishes
will come true.

31
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.789
Come on. Brian.
let's make a wish together.

32
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.315
You ready?

33
00:02:07.475 --> 00:02:10.173
<i>And in other news.
Santa will have a harder time</i>

34
00:02:10.304 --> 00:02:12.001
<i>delivering gifts
this Christmas Eve.</i>

35
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.872
<i>It seems that
Ginger the reindeer</i>

36
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.701
<i>has escaped
from the local petting zoo.</i>

37
00:02:16.832 --> 00:02:19.095
<i>Sounds like Ginger
has finally snapped.</i>

38
00:02:22.838 --> 00:02:24.056
Ahh!

39
00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:25.536
Oh.

40
00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:27.843
Ah. Merry Christmas. Brian.

41
00:02:27.973 --> 00:02:30.150
Still no decorations. huh?

42
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.239
Some of us are busy
working for a living.

43
00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:34.458
Besides. it's not Christmas Day
until tomorrow.

44
00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.244
Well. managing my trust fund
takes a lot of work.

45
00:02:37.374 --> 00:02:39.463
I'm sure your parents
are very proud.

46
00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:41.857
Well. yeah. they ac--

47
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:58.526
Oh. whoa. be careful.
There's a slippery patch there.

48
00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:02.834
Merry Christmas. folks.

49
00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:04.880
Good morning. Mr. Conway.

50
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.883
What makes it good. Jet?

51
00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:10.233
Nothing.
It's a horrible day. sir.

52
00:03:10.364 --> 00:03:11.365
You'll never get
anywhere in life

53
00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:13.410
with that kind
of negative attitude.

54
00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:22.158
There is an ice slick
out front.

55
00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:23.638
It is a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

56
00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:24.769
On it. sir.

57
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.294
You have the board meeting
at 9:00.

58
00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:29.121
And I need you to sign off
on some of these details

59
00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:30.384
for the Christmas carnival
fundraiser tonight.

60
00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:33.038
Ugh. Christmas.

61
00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:34.518
Schmoozing with a bunch
of people I don't even like.

62
00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:37.565
The hell is this?

63
00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:38.957
Never show me
one of these again.

64
00:03:39.088 --> 00:03:40.263
Yes. sir. Sorry. sir.

65
00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:42.178
I'm disappointed in you.

66
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:44.485
Just think about all the joy

67
00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:45.747
this party brings to people
every year.

68
00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:48.315
Or think about all the money

69
00:03:48.445 --> 00:03:51.056
you'll be raising
for the hospital.

70
00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:53.407
And it's a giant tax write-off.

71
00:03:53.537 --> 00:03:56.453
Oh.
Now there's a ray of sunshine.

72
00:03:56.584 --> 00:03:58.194
Morning. all.

73
00:03:58.325 --> 00:04:00.718
How are the numbers on our big
pre-Christmas event. hmm?

74
00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.503
Did the coupons we mailed out
bring in the business

75
00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:03.721
we'd hoped for?

76
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:09.118
I'm afraid
the numbers aren't good.

77
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.860
We are down...

78
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.993
20% from last Christmas.

79
00:04:15.124 --> 00:04:18.432
which is down...

80
00:04:18.562 --> 00:04:23.654
10% from the year
before that one.

81
00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:28.093
Well. we're just going
to have to work harder.

82
00:04:28.224 --> 00:04:31.488
I would like a plan
for improving our retail sales

83
00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:33.838
on my desk
by the end of the day.

84
00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.927
I don't care
if you have to work all night.

85
00:04:36.058 --> 00:04:41.019
Um. it's Christmas Eve. sir.

86
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.326
I took my father's
tiny appliance repair shop

87
00:04:43.457 --> 00:04:44.806
and turned it
into a multimillion-dollar

88
00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:47.243
electronics retail chain.

89
00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:49.811
number one in the region.

90
00:04:49.941 --> 00:04:51.943
I didn't do it
by taking days off.

91
00:04:52.074 --> 00:04:57.035
It took hard work
and sacrifice.

92
00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:59.734
That is the key to success.

93
00:04:59.864 --> 00:05:03.085
But I am a benevolent boss.

94
00:05:03.215 --> 00:05:07.524
so if anyone can come up
with a solution right away

95
00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:10.179
then you may all get home
in time

96
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.486
to put out a plate
of cookies for Santa.

97
00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.793
Anyone?

98
00:05:15.924 --> 00:05:17.317
Well...

99
00:05:17.447 --> 00:05:19.014
Some of our research shows

100
00:05:19.144 --> 00:05:21.059
that PC Electric
is not reaching

101
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.584
our younger client base.

102
00:05:23.714 --> 00:05:28.066
What about a rebrand?

103
00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:30.765
Something fresher.
more electric?

104
00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:33.463
I love that idea.

105
00:05:33.594 --> 00:05:35.030
We could hire a marketing firm

106
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.207
geared towards millennials
and Gen Z.

107
00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.644
Maybe connect
with some influencers.

108
00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:43.647
Oh. that sounds ridiculous.

109
00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:44.822
And expensive.

110
00:05:44.953 --> 00:05:46.998
How am I supposed
to finance that?

111
00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:49.740
We could get an investor.

112
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:54.266
Uh. I know business
has been off for a while.

113
00:05:54.397 --> 00:05:56.878
so I've been researching
potential investors

114
00:05:57.008 --> 00:05:59.271
in my spare time--
when I'm home alone.

115
00:05:59.402 --> 00:06:01.273
because I live alone

116
00:06:01.404 --> 00:06:04.407
and I have no life
outside of this job.

117
00:06:04.538 --> 00:06:06.931
I mean. I do have a hamster.

118
00:06:07.062 --> 00:06:09.107
But she's ignoring me
right now.

119
00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:10.021
because I ran out
of her favorite

120
00:06:10.152 --> 00:06:11.153
organic carrot crackers--

121
00:06:11.283 --> 00:06:13.721
- Focus. Jet!
- Sorry.

122
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:17.594
So the other day.
I heard from Nina Nishi

123
00:06:17.725 --> 00:06:20.031
that she might be
interested in investing.

124
00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:22.512
Oh. wait. Nina Nishi?

125
00:06:22.643 --> 00:06:25.297
As in the founder of Pocket.

126
00:06:25.428 --> 00:06:26.690
That's the shopping app. right?

127
00:06:26.821 --> 00:06:29.301
How do you possibly know her?

128
00:06:29.432 --> 00:06:30.781
She follows
my hamster fashion account.

129
00:06:30.912 --> 00:06:32.261
Oh.

130
00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.264
Anyway. she's in town
today. actually.

131
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:39.529
So I could set up
a lunch or something.

132
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.140
Why would she invest in us?

133
00:06:42.271 --> 00:06:45.448
So she just sold Pocket
for a ton of money.

134
00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:47.755
and she's looking
for her next project.

135
00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:52.412
She seems to think
PC Electric might be it.

136
00:06:59.593 --> 00:07:01.116
Fine.

137
00:07:01.246 --> 00:07:02.509
Set it up.

138
00:07:04.728 --> 00:07:06.034
Nina wants to meet you
at the store

139
00:07:06.164 --> 00:07:07.383
so she can check it out.

140
00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:09.429
So I don't have
to pay for lunch. perfect.

141
00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:12.736
I should warn you. though.
she's a bit. um. unpredictable.

142
00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:15.739
- What does that mean?
- Papa!

143
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.872
Harkin! Michelle.
What a surprise.

144
00:07:18.002 --> 00:07:19.090
Hi.

145
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:20.352
I have a surgery
scheduled today.

146
00:07:20.483 --> 00:07:22.311
and my nanny just
called in sick.

147
00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.139
Dave is in Paris
with his new girlfriend.

148
00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:25.532
I need someone
to watch her again.

149
00:07:25.662 --> 00:07:28.186
You want me to babysit?
What about your mother?

150
00:07:28.317 --> 00:07:29.753
Well. besides the fact
that I trust her even less

151
00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:33.191
with a child than I trust you.
she is in Brazil in a yurt.

152
00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:35.063
ironically enough
searching for her inner child.

153
00:07:35.193 --> 00:07:36.412
Ha.

154
00:07:36.543 --> 00:07:38.719
I--you can just put her

155
00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:40.503
in a conference room
with her iPad.

156
00:07:40.634 --> 00:07:42.331
She won't bother anyone.
right. sweetie?

157
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.115
I can do a cartwheel.
Want to see?

158
00:07:44.246 --> 00:07:45.377
Well. maybe later. sweetie.

159
00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:46.814
I can't.

160
00:07:46.944 --> 00:07:48.598
Today's a really busy day
with work.

161
00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:50.252
Please. Dad. I'm desperate.

162
00:07:50.382 --> 00:07:51.601
This is a really
important surgery.

163
00:07:51.732 --> 00:07:53.647
I would love to.
It's just not a good day.

164
00:07:53.777 --> 00:07:55.910
I'm really good
at cartwheeling.

165
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.259
I'm sure you are.

166
00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:58.739
I'll figure it out.

167
00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:01.002
It's fine. Come on.

168
00:08:01.132 --> 00:08:02.612
So I'm not going to play
with Papa today?

169
00:08:02.743 --> 00:08:03.700
No. no. not today. sweetie.

170
00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:05.833
Michelle.

171
00:08:05.963 --> 00:08:07.399
You'll be
at the carnival later?

172
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.184
After all. it is a fundraiser
for your hospital.

173
00:08:09.314 --> 00:08:10.490
Of course.

174
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.579
I always do
what's expected of me.

175
00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:16.191
Come on. let's go.

176
00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:19.586
Boy. today could not end
soon enough.

177
00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:26.244
Think we'd have
more people here.

178
00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:27.768
the day before Christmas.

179
00:08:27.898 --> 00:08:30.422
I'm sure it'll pick up
with last-minute shoppers.

180
00:08:30.553 --> 00:08:31.293
Oh. there she is!

181
00:08:31.423 --> 00:08:33.904
Nina.
- Jet.

182
00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:36.385
It is so good
to finally meet you in person.

183
00:08:38.735 --> 00:08:41.651
This man is a creative genius.
- Oh. stop it.

184
00:08:41.782 --> 00:08:43.348
Hamsters are the new ferrets.

185
00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:45.133
- If you say so.
- I do.

186
00:08:45.263 --> 00:08:47.570
I have very good instincts
about animals--

187
00:08:47.701 --> 00:08:48.963
and people.

188
00:08:49.093 --> 00:08:50.399
Shall I show you
around the place?

189
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.053
- Oh. of course.
- After you. please.

190
00:08:52.183 --> 00:08:53.184
Thank you.

191
00:08:56.318 --> 00:08:59.408
Whoa. Love it. love it.

192
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.889
So old-fashioned
and out of touch.

193
00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:04.369
Well. I prefer
the term "classic."

194
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.110
- Gumdrop?
- Oh. no thank you.

195
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:09.113
Oh. come on.
Just--nah. nah. nah. nah.

196
00:09:09.244 --> 00:09:10.854
Mm.

197
00:09:10.985 --> 00:09:13.553
Listen. I've been running
the numbers Jet sent.

198
00:09:13.683 --> 00:09:16.207
Your overhead is too high.

199
00:09:16.338 --> 00:09:18.470
but there's a real opportunity
to leverage market share

200
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:21.082
by expanding the omni-channel
retail strategy.

201
00:09:21.212 --> 00:09:22.736
I'm definitely interested.

202
00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:24.694
We have been
experiencing some--

203
00:09:24.825 --> 00:09:26.391
some supply chain issues.

204
00:09:26.522 --> 00:09:28.698
Is that
the newest Pokémon game?

205
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:29.960
I'll take all of them.

206
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:31.962
What will you do
with so many?

207
00:09:32.093 --> 00:09:34.051
Give them away. of course.

208
00:09:34.182 --> 00:09:36.314
I mean. I love buying presents.

209
00:09:36.445 --> 00:09:38.969
What fun is being rich
if you don't spend it?

210
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.884
Speaking of spending money.
I hear you have

211
00:09:41.015 --> 00:09:42.973
a big fundraiser tonight.

212
00:09:43.104 --> 00:09:44.496
Yes. for Bradley Hospital.

213
00:09:44.627 --> 00:09:46.020
We're raising money
for the new children's wing.

214
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.282
You should come.

215
00:09:47.412 --> 00:09:49.284
I know how much
you love Christmas.

216
00:09:49.414 --> 00:09:51.068
Presents
and shiny decorated trees

217
00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:52.766
and Santa and candy everywhere.

218
00:09:52.896 --> 00:09:54.419
I mean.
who doesn't love Christmas?

219
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.595
Oh. I love Christmas.

220
00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:57.771
I knew we'd get along.

221
00:09:57.901 --> 00:09:59.686
All right. I've gotta run.

222
00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:01.035
There's a gingerbread house
eating contest

223
00:10:01.165 --> 00:10:02.384
I plan on winning.

224
00:10:02.514 --> 00:10:03.690
I'll see you tonight
and we'll talk later.

225
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.126
See you there.

226
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:11.045
You know. I'm starting
to like this day.

227
00:10:11.175 --> 00:10:13.351
I may even be feeling
some of that Christmas spirit

228
00:10:13.482 --> 00:10:15.789
they talk about.

229
00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:18.661
No. that's just heartburn.

230
00:10:44.252 --> 00:10:45.601
Thank you so much for coming.

231
00:10:45.732 --> 00:10:48.212
Oh. heavens--well. listen.
save a dance for me. OK?

232
00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:52.826
Brad. Bernadette.
go have a couple of drinks.

233
00:10:52.956 --> 00:10:54.479
We'll talk about
your checkbook later.

234
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.352
Take care.

235
00:10:57.482 --> 00:11:00.877
Oh. Dr. Angeloni.
thanks for coming.

236
00:11:01.008 --> 00:11:03.010
With the money you raise
for the hospital

237
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.752
and the work
your daughter does for us.

238
00:11:05.882 --> 00:11:07.579
I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

239
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.756
It's the least I can do
for the children.

240
00:11:11.453 --> 00:11:14.848
Merry Christmas. Brian.

241
00:11:14.978 --> 00:11:17.633
Sarah Brown.
How long has it been?

242
00:11:17.764 --> 00:11:19.156
Since you broke my heart?

243
00:11:19.287 --> 00:11:22.725
As I recall. you're the one
who broke up with me.

244
00:11:22.856 --> 00:11:24.161
I got tired
of waiting for you

245
00:11:24.292 --> 00:11:25.772
to come home from the office.

246
00:11:25.902 --> 00:11:26.990
I was building a business.

247
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:29.993
Silly me.
I was building a life.

248
00:11:30.124 --> 00:11:33.344
Well. what brings you here?

249
00:11:33.475 --> 00:11:35.259
Was it to see me?

250
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.785
No. I volunteer
at the hospital.

251
00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:43.006
I'm here on a date.

252
00:11:43.137 --> 00:11:44.486
I should go find him.

253
00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:46.575
Merry Christmas. Brian.

254
00:11:51.406 --> 00:11:53.234
- Oh. great. you made it.
- Yeah.

255
00:11:53.364 --> 00:11:55.149
Let me introduce you--
my daughter.

256
00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:56.193
the brilliant surgeon.

257
00:11:56.324 --> 00:11:59.414
She works at Bradley. you know.

258
00:11:59.544 --> 00:12:00.937
It's been a bit
of a rough day. Dad.

259
00:12:01.068 --> 00:12:02.765
I'm sorry. I have to go talk
to someone important.

260
00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:09.598
You know what?
Just give me the whole can.

261
00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:12.035
Did you just tip him $100 for
a whole can of whipped cream?

262
00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:13.210
It should be $200. right?

263
00:12:13.341 --> 00:12:15.604
I mean. it's Christmas.

264
00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:18.781
I'm glad you could make it.

265
00:12:18.912 --> 00:12:21.653
I can't resist
a good Christmas party.

266
00:12:21.784 --> 00:12:23.873
This is not
a good Christmas party. though.

267
00:12:24.004 --> 00:12:25.788
I mean. it's called
a Christmas carnival.

268
00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:27.703
but there's no games.
there's no fun.

269
00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:29.400
there's not even a Santa Claus.

270
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:31.794
You should dress up as Santa.

271
00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:34.841
That will never happen.

272
00:12:34.971 --> 00:12:36.625
It's really not
that kind of party. anyway.

273
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.758
It's more of a fundraiser
for the kids.

274
00:12:38.888 --> 00:12:40.063
Well. people would give
a lot more

275
00:12:40.194 --> 00:12:41.717
if there were actual kids here.

276
00:12:41.848 --> 00:12:43.675
having fun. opening presents.

277
00:12:43.806 --> 00:12:45.765
spreading sticky candy cane
joy everywhere.

278
00:12:45.895 --> 00:12:47.201
I'll keep that in mind
for next year.

279
00:12:47.331 --> 00:12:49.159
Well. next year you won't
have to worry about it.

280
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.726
Why is that?

281
00:12:50.857 --> 00:12:52.684
Because I don't want
to invest in your company.

282
00:12:52.815 --> 00:12:54.643
I want to buy it.

283
00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.340
Buy it?

284
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:57.341
The whole thing?

285
00:12:57.472 --> 00:12:58.690
I'm an only child.

286
00:12:58.821 --> 00:13:00.301
I might like
to give things away.

287
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:01.563
but I don't like to share.

288
00:13:01.693 --> 00:13:03.783
I need to be in charge.

289
00:13:03.913 --> 00:13:07.003
This company.
it's my whole life.

290
00:13:07.134 --> 00:13:09.136
I'm gonna bypass the deep
sadness of that statement

291
00:13:09.266 --> 00:13:10.746
and just point out.
you're gonna make

292
00:13:10.877 --> 00:13:12.139
a lot of money in this deal.

293
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:14.010
You'll be so rich
that you will never have

294
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:15.316
to worry about money again.

295
00:13:15.446 --> 00:13:16.708
You'll be able to do
whatever you want.

296
00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:17.927
You won't have to answer
to anyone.

297
00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:20.147
Your life will be
all about you.

298
00:13:20.277 --> 00:13:22.149
It's a family business.

299
00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:24.325
My father--
- Would want this for you.

300
00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:26.283
You took his tiny.
struggling shop

301
00:13:26.414 --> 00:13:29.460
and turned it into a company
worth millions.

302
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:30.853
Think of how proud he would be.

303
00:13:32.724 --> 00:13:37.251
You'd have to promise to keep
the fundraiser every year.

304
00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:39.209
Bradley Hospital is very
important in this community.

305
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.690
Of course.

306
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:42.909
Why not?

307
00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:44.345
- Really?
- Yes.

308
00:13:46.521 --> 00:13:47.739
I have worked hard.

309
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.264
It's time I got
what I deserved. huh?

310
00:13:50.394 --> 00:13:51.743
Let's drink to that.

311
00:13:51.874 --> 00:13:54.007
Here's to my just desserts.

312
00:13:54.137 --> 00:13:55.312
Mm.

313
00:13:55.443 --> 00:13:56.705
- Mm.
- Ah.

314
00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.707
You know. I'm beginning
to like this day.

315
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.796
I wish it would never end.

316
00:14:00.927 --> 00:14:01.884
Sir. it's time
for your speech.

317
00:14:02.015 --> 00:14:03.233
Oh. right.

318
00:14:03.364 --> 00:14:05.192
Yeah. I'll just go
spread the good news.

319
00:14:08.238 --> 00:14:09.152
Mm.

320
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.374
Good evening. everyone.

321
00:14:13.504 --> 00:14:14.723
I'd like to welcome you

322
00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.899
to the PC Electric
Christmas Carnival.

323
00:14:21.817 --> 00:14:24.820
I'd like to thank you for your
support for Bradley Hospital

324
00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:27.779
and for giving so generously
of your time--

325
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.565
and your money too.

326
00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:34.874
Now. my commitment
to the hospital

327
00:14:35.004 --> 00:14:36.223
isn't based
solely upon the fact

328
00:14:36.353 --> 00:14:38.007
that my brilliant daughter. Michelle.

329
00:14:38.138 --> 00:14:39.182
happens to be a surgeon there.

330
00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:41.532
There she is. yes. yes.

331
00:14:41.663 --> 00:14:42.751
Don't be so shy. honey.

332
00:14:45.145 --> 00:14:48.844
But I am also dedicated
to this community.

333
00:14:48.975 --> 00:14:51.412
And in the name of community.

334
00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:53.980
I would like to announce
that I intend to forgo

335
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.807
the customary Christmas bonuses
this year

336
00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:58.332
and instead give
a sizable donation

337
00:14:58.462 --> 00:15:01.422
to the hospital
on behalf of my employees.

338
00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:06.035
- So we get nothing.
- And he gets a tax write-off.

339
00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:08.037
Generous and business savvy.

340
00:15:08.168 --> 00:15:10.083
The man is a machine.

341
00:15:10.213 --> 00:15:14.304
It's the least I can do.

342
00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:17.220
And the least you can do
is go have some fun.

343
00:15:17.351 --> 00:15:19.266
Enjoy yourselves. please.

344
00:15:19.396 --> 00:15:23.096
May your Christmas be
full of gifts.

345
00:15:23.226 --> 00:15:26.273
preferably purchased
from PC Electric.

346
00:15:31.017 --> 00:15:33.106
Go on out there.
Enjoy yourselves.

347
00:15:33.236 --> 00:15:34.672
Thanks again for coming.
How was that?

348
00:15:34.803 --> 00:15:35.586
Pretty great. I'd say. huh?
Huh?

349
00:15:35.717 --> 00:15:37.066
Yeah. you were great. yeah.

350
00:15:37.197 --> 00:15:38.938
It's just been
kind of a tough day for me.

351
00:15:39.068 --> 00:15:40.417
Listen. something else
has come up.

352
00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:43.812
I'm thinking about selling
the company to Nina Nishi.

353
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.728
Who? What?
You're selling the company?

354
00:15:46.858 --> 00:15:48.121
What are you gonna do?

355
00:15:48.251 --> 00:15:50.558
What's gonna happen
to your employees?

356
00:15:50.688 --> 00:15:52.299
That's not my problem.

357
00:15:52.429 --> 00:15:55.084
Brian. Brian. come on!
Let's celebrate!

358
00:15:55.215 --> 00:15:56.694
We'll talk about it later.

359
00:15:56.825 --> 00:15:59.654
Oh. my.

360
00:15:59.784 --> 00:16:01.525
I had no idea
you were so much fun.

361
00:16:13.537 --> 00:16:15.191
<i>♪ On the first day
of Christmas ♪</i>

362
00:16:15.322 --> 00:16:18.325
<i>♪ My true love sent to me</i>
- Ugh. Hate this song.

363
00:16:18.455 --> 00:16:22.068
<i>♪ A partridge
in a pear tree ♪</i>

364
00:16:22.198 --> 00:16:23.243
- Oh. come on.
<i>- ♪ On the second day--</i>

365
00:16:25.114 --> 00:16:26.289
<i>♪ My true love sent to me</i>

366
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.162
The heck is going on?

367
00:16:42.088 --> 00:16:44.351
Merry Christmas. Brian.

368
00:16:45.917 --> 00:16:48.137
It's not Christmas yet.

369
00:16:48.268 --> 00:16:50.226
Ooh. you're right.

370
00:16:50.357 --> 00:16:53.186
And I'm afraid
it never will be for you again.

371
00:16:54.709 --> 00:16:56.711
Am I dead?

372
00:16:56.841 --> 00:16:58.017
Pretty much.

373
00:16:58.147 --> 00:17:01.498
I'm just here
to send you on your way.

374
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:04.327
The Angel of Death is Santa?

375
00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:07.200
It's different for everyone.

376
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.725
And. well. tis the season.

377
00:17:10.855 --> 00:17:14.120
But I'm not ready to die.
Not today.

378
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.078
I'm just about to get
everything I ever wanted.

379
00:17:16.209 --> 00:17:18.994
Really?
Are you sure about that?

380
00:17:19.125 --> 00:17:20.865
Please. give me
a second chance.

381
00:17:20.996 --> 00:17:22.302
I'll do anything.

382
00:17:22.432 --> 00:17:26.088
Well. you're not quite
on the naughty list.

383
00:17:26.219 --> 00:17:28.090
but you've never been
particularly nice.

384
00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:29.178
I'll change.

385
00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:31.441
I promise. I'll work harder.

386
00:17:31.572 --> 00:17:35.445
I'll do better.
Just let me live.

387
00:17:35.576 --> 00:17:38.405
Oh. you know.
I'm feeling generous today.

388
00:17:38.535 --> 00:17:40.494
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you

389
00:17:40.624 --> 00:17:42.539
12 days to get it right.

390
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.150
12 Days of Christmas Eve.

391
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.716
Oh. 12 days.

392
00:17:45.847 --> 00:17:48.067
12 days. So I'm not gonna die.

393
00:17:48.197 --> 00:17:50.417
Well. that's up to you.

394
00:17:50.547 --> 00:17:53.202
If by the time
the 12 drummers drumming

395
00:17:53.333 --> 00:17:55.117
have beaten their last note.

396
00:17:55.248 --> 00:18:00.601
you still haven't figured out
the true meaning of Christmas--

397
00:18:00.731 --> 00:18:03.908
the true meaning of life--

398
00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:07.129
well. then. it's off to that
giant Christmas tree farm

399
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.131
in the sky.

400
00:18:09.262 --> 00:18:13.657
I promise. I'll learn it.

401
00:18:13.788 --> 00:18:15.529
I'll live it.

402
00:18:15.659 --> 00:18:17.183
I won't let you down.

403
00:18:18.793 --> 00:18:22.797
Blow out the candle
and go deck those halls.

404
00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:27.323
Is that--

405
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:50.651
Weird dream.

406
00:18:53.654 --> 00:18:56.091
<i>And in other news.
Santa will have</i>

407
00:18:56.222 --> 00:18:58.485
<i>a harder time delivering gifts
this Christmas Eve.</i>

408
00:18:58.615 --> 00:19:00.051
<i>It seems that
Ginger the reindeer</i>

409
00:19:00.182 --> 00:19:02.750
<i>has escaped
from the local petting zoo.</i>

410
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.100
<i>Sounds like Ginger
has finally snapped.</i>

411
00:19:13.064 --> 00:19:15.415
Ah. Merry Christmas. Brian.

412
00:19:15.545 --> 00:19:17.895
Yes.
It's not Christmas. is it?

413
00:19:18.026 --> 00:19:19.419
It's still Christmas Eve.

414
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:20.898
It was all a dream.

415
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.381
OK.

416
00:19:32.649 --> 00:19:33.998
Oh. whoa. be careful.

417
00:19:34.129 --> 00:19:35.522
There's a slippery patch there.

418
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.528
Merry Christmas. folks.

419
00:19:41.658 --> 00:19:44.922
I'm afraid
the numbers aren't good.

420
00:19:45.053 --> 00:19:47.447
We are down...

421
00:19:47.577 --> 00:19:50.406
20% from last Christmas.

422
00:19:50.537 --> 00:19:53.670
which is down...

423
00:19:53.801 --> 00:19:56.804
10% from the year before that.

424
00:19:57.848 --> 00:19:59.720
Some of our research shows

425
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.809
that PC Electric
is not reaching

426
00:20:01.939 --> 00:20:04.464
our younger client base.

427
00:20:04.594 --> 00:20:09.077
What about a rebrand?

428
00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:13.386
Something fresher.
more electric?

429
00:20:13.516 --> 00:20:16.302
She doesn't want to invest.
She wants to buy the company.

430
00:20:16.432 --> 00:20:17.955
Who is she?

431
00:20:18.086 --> 00:20:19.174
Nina Nishi.

432
00:20:19.305 --> 00:20:21.307
How do you know that?

433
00:20:21.437 --> 00:20:23.091
She told me yesterday.

434
00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:26.660
You spoke
with Nina Nishi yesterday?

435
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.576
It wasn't a dream.

436
00:20:29.706 --> 00:20:31.708
It happened.
and it's happening again.

437
00:20:31.839 --> 00:20:33.754
What's happening again. sir?

438
00:20:33.884 --> 00:20:36.104
I can't--I can't breathe.

439
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.497
It's real.

440
00:20:37.627 --> 00:20:39.020
Santa was real.

441
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.369
I've got to get out of here.

442
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.589
Are you OK?
Do you need CPR?

443
00:20:42.719 --> 00:20:44.155
Have to find Santa.

444
00:20:44.286 --> 00:20:45.026
Have to find Santa.

445
00:20:45.156 --> 00:20:46.027
Papa!

446
00:20:46.157 --> 00:20:48.203
Oh. I can't watch her today.

447
00:20:48.334 --> 00:20:49.639
I can't!

448
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.337
How did you know
I was gonna ask that?

449
00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:54.470
Because it's the second day
of Christmas Eve.

450
00:20:54.601 --> 00:20:56.646
Gotta find Santa.

451
00:20:56.777 --> 00:20:57.865
I gotta find Santa.
- Hey. watch out for the--

452
00:20:57.995 --> 00:20:59.475
Ah!

453
00:20:59.606 --> 00:21:01.260
Oh. damn.

454
00:21:03.044 --> 00:21:05.220
Well. that was quick.

455
00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:07.353
Why are you doing this to me?

456
00:21:07.483 --> 00:21:08.832
You asked for this.

457
00:21:08.963 --> 00:21:10.486
You begged me.

458
00:21:10.617 --> 00:21:12.836
You said you wanted to live.

459
00:21:12.967 --> 00:21:14.577
We made a deal.

460
00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:17.058
You said you would do better.

461
00:21:17.188 --> 00:21:21.062
This isn't a dream.
and it isn't a joke.

462
00:21:21.192 --> 00:21:23.456
You've already wasted one day.

463
00:21:23.586 --> 00:21:26.720
You've got ten days left.

464
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.200
Don't blow it.

465
00:21:29.331 --> 00:21:30.680
You just watch.

466
00:21:30.811 --> 00:21:32.073
I'm gonna make this
the merriest Christmas Eve

467
00:21:32.203 --> 00:21:33.422
anybody has ever seen.

468
00:21:53.964 --> 00:21:56.532
Oh. hey.
Merry Christmas. Brian.

469
00:21:56.663 --> 00:22:00.536
Jason. have you ever seen
one of those time loop movies

470
00:22:00.667 --> 00:22:01.798
where a person gets stuck
in the same day

471
00:22:01.929 --> 00:22:02.625
over and over again?

472
00:22:02.756 --> 00:22:04.235
Oh. yeah. I love those.

473
00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:05.933
How do they usually
get out of it?

474
00:22:06.063 --> 00:22:07.674
Well. they usually
get out of it

475
00:22:07.804 --> 00:22:09.893
when they stop being selfish
and start helping other people.

476
00:22:10.024 --> 00:22:12.505
Exactly. Yes. that's it.
That's the answer.

477
00:22:12.635 --> 00:22:14.333
- Well. yeah. To what?
- To life.

478
00:22:14.463 --> 00:22:15.943
All I have to do is make

479
00:22:16.073 --> 00:22:18.119
everybody's Christmas wish
come true. and I'll live.

480
00:22:18.249 --> 00:22:20.077
This is gonna be so easy!

481
00:22:23.472 --> 00:22:24.604
Ooh. he's cracking up.

482
00:22:24.734 --> 00:22:27.650
Morning. Sam.

483
00:22:27.781 --> 00:22:30.174
Merry Christmas!

484
00:22:30.305 --> 00:22:32.307
So since the Christmas spirit

485
00:22:32.438 --> 00:22:35.354
is all about giving
and caring for others.

486
00:22:35.484 --> 00:22:37.747
I have decided to give you all
the week off.

487
00:22:37.878 --> 00:22:40.315
And I'm going to give you
a 10% raise

488
00:22:40.446 --> 00:22:42.578
and a week's salary as a bonus.

489
00:22:42.709 --> 00:22:44.275
Everyone?

490
00:22:44.406 --> 00:22:46.843
Yes. Jet. everyone.
including you.

491
00:22:46.974 --> 00:22:48.584
Although I do still need
your help

492
00:22:48.715 --> 00:22:51.239
with the Christmas carnival
stuff this evening. all right?

493
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.547
I have to raise as much money
as I possibly can for Santa.

494
00:22:54.677 --> 00:22:57.419
I mean. for the hospital.
of course.

495
00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.813
How are we going to pay
for all of this?

496
00:22:59.943 --> 00:23:01.728
The numbers are down.

497
00:23:01.858 --> 00:23:03.164
We'll worry about that
tomorrow. Dale.

498
00:23:03.294 --> 00:23:05.645
Today. our only concern
is that everyone is happy.

499
00:23:05.775 --> 00:23:08.169
Ooh. that reminds me.
I'd better get going

500
00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:10.476
if I'm going to get all
of my good deeds in today.

501
00:23:12.956 --> 00:23:14.218
Papa!

502
00:23:14.349 --> 00:23:15.829
Oh. guys. guys. hi.

503
00:23:15.959 --> 00:23:18.527
Listen. this--this should--
should cover a sitter.

504
00:23:18.658 --> 00:23:20.964
And I'll tell you what.
no--why don't you just

505
00:23:21.095 --> 00:23:22.836
take the day off
and go shopping on me?

506
00:23:22.966 --> 00:23:24.968
What's going on?

507
00:23:25.099 --> 00:23:27.667
Can't talk!
Gotta go save the world!

508
00:23:32.193 --> 00:23:33.499
Whoa. whoa. hey. listen.

509
00:23:33.629 --> 00:23:35.979
Didn't get me this time. huh?

510
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.503
Oh. sorry.
I'll have to owe you.

511
00:23:37.633 --> 00:23:38.939
I'm fresh out of cash.

512
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:48.470
Wow. there's a lot of them.

513
00:23:50.516 --> 00:23:52.300
What the heck.
I'll take them all.

514
00:23:53.823 --> 00:23:56.304
Ah! Stop! Stop!

515
00:24:04.094 --> 00:24:06.445
Excuse me. Excuse me. miss.
Thank you.

516
00:24:06.575 --> 00:24:08.621
Merry Christmas. Here we are.

517
00:24:08.751 --> 00:24:10.840
A little something for you.
just because it's Christmas.

518
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:12.581
And how about
a nice big green box?

519
00:24:12.712 --> 00:24:13.887
Come to my party later.

520
00:24:14.017 --> 00:24:15.976
Oh. look.
Yes. a little triceratops.

521
00:24:16.106 --> 00:24:17.194
Give that
to a youngster you know.

522
00:24:19.022 --> 00:24:20.197
Hello. my friend.

523
00:24:20.328 --> 00:24:21.503
Here you are.

524
00:24:21.634 --> 00:24:23.244
What am I supposed to do
with this?

525
00:24:23.374 --> 00:24:25.376
Well. whatever you like.
You see how unselfish I am?

526
00:24:25.507 --> 00:24:27.248
Merry Christmas.

527
00:24:27.378 --> 00:24:28.641
You see. Santa?

528
00:24:28.771 --> 00:24:29.642
You see all the nice things
I'm doing?

529
00:24:29.772 --> 00:24:31.295
You can't kill me now.

530
00:24:31.426 --> 00:24:34.081
Santa kills people?

531
00:24:34.211 --> 00:24:36.387
No. It was a joke.

532
00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:38.389
I was kidding.

533
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.567
Here. have a toaster.

534
00:24:43.264 --> 00:24:44.700
That one doesn't count.

535
00:24:49.183 --> 00:24:50.924
My goodness.
I love this jacket.

536
00:24:51.054 --> 00:24:52.229
You know what.
I haven't seen that since--

537
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.753
what was that movie
with Dennis Hopper?

538
00:24:53.883 --> 00:24:56.886
<i>♪ Fa-la-la-la-la.
la-la-la-la ♪</i>

539
00:24:57.017 --> 00:25:00.542
<i>♪ Deck the halls
with boughs of holly ♪</i>

540
00:25:00.673 --> 00:25:04.198
<i>♪ Fa-la-la-la-la.
la-la-la-la ♪</i>

541
00:25:04.328 --> 00:25:06.679
<i>♪ Tis the season to be jolly</i>

542
00:25:06.809 --> 00:25:09.203
Brian has lost his mind.

543
00:25:09.333 --> 00:25:11.248
And most
of next year's budget.

544
00:25:14.425 --> 00:25:16.689
Good evening. everyone.

545
00:25:16.819 --> 00:25:18.691
Thank you for being here
and supporting me

546
00:25:18.821 --> 00:25:20.823
and Bradley Hospital.

547
00:25:20.954 --> 00:25:23.870
I have been selfish

548
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.526
and stingy sometimes.

549
00:25:27.656 --> 00:25:29.571
but that is all
about to change.

550
00:25:29.702 --> 00:25:32.661
Now. I am interested
only in giving.

551
00:25:32.792 --> 00:25:35.446
After all. isn't that
the meaning of Christmas?

552
00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:38.798
So let's keep giving
to Bradley Hospital

553
00:25:38.928 --> 00:25:40.060
and to each other.

554
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.278
Aha!

555
00:25:43.803 --> 00:25:45.500
Merry Christmas.

556
00:25:45.631 --> 00:25:46.980
You guys. you came.

557
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.764
Oh. this is wonderful.

558
00:25:48.895 --> 00:25:51.201
Did you see? Did you see that?
Did you see how generous I was?

559
00:25:51.332 --> 00:25:52.899
Dad. what is going on?

560
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:55.771
I am making everybody's
Christmas wishes come true.

561
00:25:55.902 --> 00:25:57.251
Ooh. speaking of making
wishes come true.

562
00:25:57.381 --> 00:25:58.295
wait till you see
what I got you.

563
00:25:58.426 --> 00:26:00.428
Jet.

564
00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.473
It's the dog
you always wanted.

565
00:26:02.604 --> 00:26:03.866
She's allergic.

566
00:26:03.997 --> 00:26:05.259
Barely.

567
00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:07.261
A few sniffles
never hurt anybody.

568
00:26:07.391 --> 00:26:08.741
- Let's go. let's go.
- What?

569
00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:09.655
I have to get
her some Benadryl.

570
00:26:09.785 --> 00:26:11.091
- Why?
- OK?

571
00:26:11.221 --> 00:26:12.353
Michelle.

572
00:26:12.483 --> 00:26:14.442
Oh. Oh!

573
00:26:15.965 --> 00:26:17.271
I was only trying
to make her happy.

574
00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:19.055
She doesn't need a dog
to make her happy

575
00:26:19.186 --> 00:26:21.710
or any of the 10.000 presents
you had delivered today.

576
00:26:21.841 --> 00:26:24.365
She just needs a grandfather
who pays attention to her.

577
00:26:24.495 --> 00:26:25.975
I was paying attention.

578
00:26:26.106 --> 00:26:27.542
I knew she wanted a dog.
I got her a dog.

579
00:26:27.673 --> 00:26:30.719
OK. well. we will see you
at Christmas tomorrow.

580
00:26:35.245 --> 00:26:37.073
And get that animal
out of here.

581
00:26:37.204 --> 00:26:39.598
Oh!

582
00:26:39.728 --> 00:26:41.948
Oh!

583
00:26:45.168 --> 00:26:47.214
This is pointless.

584
00:26:47.344 --> 00:26:48.476
If helping all those people
doesn't get me

585
00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:50.043
to Christmas Day.
then nothing will.

586
00:26:50.173 --> 00:26:54.787
Who were you helping
besides yourself?

587
00:26:54.917 --> 00:26:57.746
And what would
an 80-year-old grandmother

588
00:26:57.877 --> 00:27:00.314
do with an electric razor?

589
00:27:00.444 --> 00:27:03.404
Did you happen to notice
her facial hair?

590
00:27:03.534 --> 00:27:05.188
All right.
all right. all right.

591
00:27:05.319 --> 00:27:07.321
I get it.
I'll think of a better gift.

592
00:27:07.451 --> 00:27:10.193
Christmas isn't about gifting.

593
00:27:10.324 --> 00:27:12.369
It's about giving.

594
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.067
Giving what?

595
00:27:14.197 --> 00:27:15.590
Well. that's something
you'll have to figure out

596
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:17.244
on your own.

597
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:25.992
These numbers
are unacceptable.

598
00:27:26.122 --> 00:27:27.863
If you people can't come up
with a plan to improve them.

599
00:27:27.994 --> 00:27:29.386
I'm just gonna sell
the whole company

600
00:27:29.517 --> 00:27:32.215
and hope they fire
each and every one of you.

601
00:27:32.346 --> 00:27:35.871
Jet. get me an appointment
with Nina Nishi.

602
00:27:36.002 --> 00:27:37.743
She's in town
and she's interested.

603
00:27:37.873 --> 00:27:39.135
Wait. I was gonna--

604
00:27:39.266 --> 00:27:40.876
but how do you know that?

605
00:27:41.007 --> 00:27:42.791
I don't pay you
to ask questions.

606
00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:43.923
I pay you to do
what I tell you.

607
00:27:44.053 --> 00:27:46.316
Yes. sir.

608
00:27:46.447 --> 00:27:48.014
No one appreciates what I do.

609
00:27:48.144 --> 00:27:50.625
I am tired of working this hard
and getting nothing in return.

610
00:27:50.756 --> 00:27:52.714
When is it my turn?
When do I get what I want?

611
00:27:52.845 --> 00:27:53.933
What do you want. sir?

612
00:27:54.063 --> 00:27:56.196
To be happy.
just like everybody else.

613
00:27:56.326 --> 00:27:57.937
Papa!

614
00:27:58.067 --> 00:28:01.070
Harkin. hi!

615
00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:03.812
And you. my beloved child.
here to tell me again

616
00:28:03.943 --> 00:28:05.335
what a selfish person I am
for not wanting

617
00:28:05.466 --> 00:28:08.034
to watch my granddaughter.

618
00:28:08.164 --> 00:28:10.645
Not wanting to watch
my granddaughter

619
00:28:10.776 --> 00:28:12.821
go another day
without telling her

620
00:28:12.952 --> 00:28:14.997
how much I love her.

621
00:28:15.128 --> 00:28:17.478
What?

622
00:28:17.608 --> 00:28:19.436
Don't you have
a very important surgery today?

623
00:28:19.567 --> 00:28:21.177
You need someone
to look after her. I will.

624
00:28:21.308 --> 00:28:22.309
- You will?
- You will?

625
00:28:22.439 --> 00:28:23.571
Of course. no problem.

626
00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:25.486
Yay!
Can I show you my cartwheel?

627
00:28:25.616 --> 00:28:26.792
Maybe a little later.

628
00:28:26.922 --> 00:28:28.097
Thanks. Dad.

629
00:28:28.228 --> 00:28:29.359
I wouldn't ask
if I wasn't desperate.

630
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.187
I know how busy you are.

631
00:28:31.318 --> 00:28:33.450
It's really generous of you.

632
00:28:33.581 --> 00:28:35.235
From your lips
to Santa's ears.

633
00:28:38.107 --> 00:28:40.457
OK. then.

634
00:28:40.588 --> 00:28:43.330
I will see you guys
at the carnival tonight.

635
00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.375
- Great.
- Great.

636
00:28:45.506 --> 00:28:46.420
Have a good surgery.

637
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.597
Yeah.

638
00:28:51.555 --> 00:28:52.382
After all.
it's not like I haven't

639
00:28:52.513 --> 00:28:53.906
raised a child of my own.

640
00:28:54.036 --> 00:28:55.255
And you're a good kid.

641
00:28:55.385 --> 00:28:57.083
How hard could it be?

642
00:28:57.213 --> 00:28:59.259
- Can I have a Nintendo Switch?
- No.

643
00:28:59.389 --> 00:29:00.651
- Can I have an iPhone?
- No.

644
00:29:00.782 --> 00:29:02.436
- Can I show you my cartwheel?
- No.

645
00:29:02.566 --> 00:29:03.916
- Can I get a puppy?
- No.

646
00:29:04.046 --> 00:29:05.308
Jet. when does Nina get here?

647
00:29:05.439 --> 00:29:06.440
Any minute.

648
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.138
Listen.

649
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:10.531
take her. give her some candy
or something.

650
00:29:10.661 --> 00:29:11.662
Just to keep her distracted.

651
00:29:11.793 --> 00:29:12.925
Are you sure?

652
00:29:13.055 --> 00:29:14.274
She's already had
two hot chocolates

653
00:29:14.404 --> 00:29:15.666
and. like. five candy canes.
so--

654
00:29:15.797 --> 00:29:17.103
I don't care.
Just keep her away.

655
00:29:17.233 --> 00:29:19.453
Yes. sir.
Come on. Harkin. let's go.

656
00:29:19.583 --> 00:29:21.760
Oh. Nina.
how lovely to see you.

657
00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:23.283
Well. I am so happy
to be here.

658
00:29:23.413 --> 00:29:25.415
Papa. I don't feel good.

659
00:29:25.546 --> 00:29:26.677
I'm sorry about this.

660
00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:29.202
This is my granddaughter. Harkin.

661
00:29:29.332 --> 00:29:32.074
How sweet. learning
the family business already.

662
00:29:32.205 --> 00:29:33.902
Yes. you know me.
all about the children.

663
00:29:34.033 --> 00:29:35.338
I want to go home.

664
00:29:35.469 --> 00:29:36.644
Not now. honey.

665
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.124
Papa has to finish
this meeting.

666
00:29:38.254 --> 00:29:40.082
I want to go home now.

667
00:29:40.213 --> 00:29:41.518
Kids.

668
00:29:41.649 --> 00:29:43.172
Just give me
one more minute. all right?

669
00:29:48.569 --> 00:29:49.918
Maybe I should come
another time.

670
00:29:50.049 --> 00:29:51.137
No. no. No.

671
00:29:51.267 --> 00:29:52.791
I'll just go wash up.
It's fine.

672
00:29:52.921 --> 00:29:55.837
You should come to
the Christmas carnival tonight.

673
00:29:55.968 --> 00:29:57.491
Yeah. that's a great idea.

674
00:29:57.621 --> 00:29:59.232
We'll talk then.

675
00:29:59.362 --> 00:30:01.016
I feel much better now.

676
00:30:05.064 --> 00:30:07.457
You're happy here. honey?

677
00:30:07.588 --> 00:30:09.155
Nina can't make it.

678
00:30:09.285 --> 00:30:11.374
She said she'll meet you
in town next time she's here.

679
00:30:11.505 --> 00:30:14.377
No. it has to be today.
There's no tomorrow.

680
00:30:14.508 --> 00:30:15.596
Tomorrow is today.

681
00:30:15.726 --> 00:30:17.903
Yesterday is today.

682
00:30:18.033 --> 00:30:19.121
Now is all I have.

683
00:30:19.252 --> 00:30:20.470
That's so deep.

684
00:30:20.601 --> 00:30:21.558
I'm sorry I'm late.

685
00:30:21.689 --> 00:30:22.733
I had a rough day.

686
00:30:22.864 --> 00:30:24.300
Oh. did you?

687
00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:25.824
Did it involve
getting puked on?

688
00:30:25.954 --> 00:30:27.260
Or losing out on the business
deal of a lifetime?

689
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.088
'Cause that was my day.

690
00:30:29.218 --> 00:30:31.220
I'm sorry. Papa.

691
00:30:31.351 --> 00:30:34.397
Oh. it wasn't
your fault. sweetie.

692
00:30:37.009 --> 00:30:38.706
Really?

693
00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:42.362
Now what?

694
00:30:59.466 --> 00:31:01.207
You're on the right track.

695
00:31:01.337 --> 00:31:04.297
You're just going
in the wrong direction.

696
00:31:04.427 --> 00:31:09.084
Maybe try asking Harkin
where she wants to go?

697
00:31:09.215 --> 00:31:10.303
Mmm!

698
00:31:20.443 --> 00:31:21.618
Thanks. Dad.

699
00:31:21.749 --> 00:31:23.577
Are you sure you can keep her
all day?

700
00:31:23.707 --> 00:31:24.665
We'll see you
at the carnival.

701
00:31:27.363 --> 00:31:29.452
Great.

702
00:31:29.583 --> 00:31:33.108
- Bye.
- Bye.

703
00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:36.329
Well. Harkin.
what would you like to do?

704
00:31:36.459 --> 00:31:37.504
Today is your day.

705
00:31:37.634 --> 00:31:38.853
Really?

706
00:31:38.984 --> 00:31:40.159
Really.

707
00:31:40.289 --> 00:31:42.683
Today is all about you.

708
00:31:45.773 --> 00:31:48.428
Oh. my God.

709
00:31:50.996 --> 00:31:54.825
You're a mess.

710
00:31:54.956 --> 00:31:57.828
Oh--oh. yeah.
everybody needs a triceratops.

711
00:31:57.959 --> 00:32:00.657
Let's try to--
oh. yes. take that for sure.

712
00:32:06.141 --> 00:32:08.970
Oh. boy. Whew.

713
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:12.017
I have not been sledding
in a long time.

714
00:32:12.147 --> 00:32:14.454
not since your mother
was a little girl.

715
00:32:14.584 --> 00:32:16.412
Gosh this is--
this is fun. huh?

716
00:32:16.543 --> 00:32:17.544
This is the best day ever.

717
00:32:26.814 --> 00:32:28.729
You know those kids?

718
00:32:28.859 --> 00:32:31.906
They go to my school.

719
00:32:32.037 --> 00:32:33.212
Why don't you go on
down there and play with them?

720
00:32:33.342 --> 00:32:34.604
They don't like me.

721
00:32:34.735 --> 00:32:37.172
Oh. come on. Harkin.

722
00:32:37.303 --> 00:32:39.914
You gotta make some friends.
you know.

723
00:32:40.045 --> 00:32:41.655
If you're gonna be a leader.
you gotta have some followers.

724
00:32:41.785 --> 00:32:42.961
No.

725
00:32:43.091 --> 00:32:44.527
Why are you being
so difficult?

726
00:32:44.658 --> 00:32:46.225
You're acting
just like your mother.

727
00:32:46.355 --> 00:32:48.357
Yeah. well. I'd rather be
like her than you.

728
00:32:48.488 --> 00:32:51.186
She's right.
you are just a mean old man.

729
00:32:53.145 --> 00:32:55.277
Harkin.

730
00:32:55.408 --> 00:32:58.150
Harkin. I'm--I'm sorry.

731
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.239
I'm sorry.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

732
00:33:09.465 --> 00:33:10.466
Ahh!

733
00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:19.910
I gave her
everything she wanted.

734
00:33:20.041 --> 00:33:22.870
You did. but what about
what she needs?

735
00:33:41.671 --> 00:33:42.759
And then Benjamin farted

736
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.500
and the whole class smelled
like dead fish.

737
00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:47.329
That is terrible.

738
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.723
It was awesome.

739
00:33:57.122 --> 00:33:59.559
What is it about those kids
that makes you look so sad?

740
00:34:01.256 --> 00:34:02.910
They think I'm weird.

741
00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:05.347
Everyone thinks I'm weird.

742
00:34:05.478 --> 00:34:08.089
You know what you have to do
to make those kids like you?

743
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.134
What?

744
00:34:09.264 --> 00:34:10.918
Nothing.

745
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.006
Huh?

746
00:34:12.137 --> 00:34:14.139
Do you like them?

747
00:34:14.269 --> 00:34:15.836
Not really.

748
00:34:15.966 --> 00:34:17.446
Do you like yourself?

749
00:34:17.577 --> 00:34:19.361
Yes.

750
00:34:19.492 --> 00:34:21.972
Then that's all that matters.

751
00:34:22.103 --> 00:34:26.455
Because you are amazing.

752
00:34:26.586 --> 00:34:27.804
And life is too short
to worry about people

753
00:34:27.935 --> 00:34:32.287
who do not appreciate
your big. beautiful heart.

754
00:34:32.418 --> 00:34:34.420
How did you get to be
so smart. Papa?

755
00:34:37.336 --> 00:34:40.948
I'm still learning...
something new every day.

756
00:34:43.951 --> 00:34:45.387
Let's play a song.

757
00:34:45.518 --> 00:34:49.826
Oh. yeah. good idea.
let me pull a quarter out--

758
00:34:49.957 --> 00:34:52.655
I have a quarter.

759
00:34:52.786 --> 00:34:53.613
You put it up there.

760
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.099
It's broken.

761
00:35:06.756 --> 00:35:07.844
It's too bad
I don't have my tools.

762
00:35:07.975 --> 00:35:09.846
You know what.
I bet I could fix this.

763
00:35:09.977 --> 00:35:11.457
You can fix stuff?

764
00:35:11.587 --> 00:35:12.806
Yeah.

765
00:35:12.936 --> 00:35:14.590
Actually.
I'm pretty good at it.

766
00:35:14.721 --> 00:35:15.983
I can fix things.

767
00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:18.246
Can you teach me
how to fix stuff?

768
00:35:18.377 --> 00:35:20.074
Let's find out.

769
00:35:20.205 --> 00:35:22.816
This is where it all started.

770
00:35:22.946 --> 00:35:27.299
My dad. your great grandfather.

771
00:35:27.429 --> 00:35:30.693
was a real whiz
at fixing things.

772
00:35:30.824 --> 00:35:33.435
And he and I would go
to the junkyard together.

773
00:35:33.566 --> 00:35:36.525
and we'd find some stuff.
and we would fix it together.

774
00:35:39.049 --> 00:35:43.097
When your mom was little.
I'd come out here late at night

775
00:35:43.228 --> 00:35:46.535
and tinker just to take my mind
off of things at work.

776
00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:48.494
Boy. it's been forever
since I've been out here.

777
00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:55.109
Let's get started.

778
00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.154
You need to know
some of the basics. all right?

779
00:35:56.284 --> 00:35:57.938
This here. this is
a wire stripper

780
00:35:58.068 --> 00:36:00.462
and a pair of pliers.
needle nose they call them.

781
00:36:00.593 --> 00:36:02.290
Almost everything
you need to do

782
00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:03.987
in any kind of repair work.

783
00:36:04.118 --> 00:36:05.554
you have to use screwdrivers.

784
00:36:05.685 --> 00:36:08.296
You see that? OK. cool.
Here's what we'll do.

785
00:36:08.427 --> 00:36:09.732
You take the negative
and I'll place this

786
00:36:09.863 --> 00:36:11.691
on the positive.

787
00:36:11.821 --> 00:36:13.388
You see that?

788
00:36:19.002 --> 00:36:19.873
There you go. that's it. honey. Yeah.

789
00:36:20.003 --> 00:36:21.179
Very good.

790
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:23.703
OK. great.
Now. let's give her a try.

791
00:36:27.576 --> 00:36:29.796
You can do the honors.

792
00:36:33.234 --> 00:36:35.628
Well. here. hang on.
Let's adjust a little bit.

793
00:36:35.758 --> 00:36:37.456
Pretty soon--
<i>- ♪ On the sixth day</i>

794
00:36:37.586 --> 00:36:39.545
It works. We fixed it.

795
00:36:39.675 --> 00:36:41.938
This is the best day ever.

796
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:44.506
<i>♪ Four calling birds.
three French hens ♪</i>

797
00:36:44.637 --> 00:36:46.813
Now. that's enough of that.

798
00:36:46.943 --> 00:36:49.250
I wish I could fix my mom
like we fixed the radio.

799
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:52.471
What's the matter
with your mom?

800
00:36:52.601 --> 00:36:54.124
She works too hard

801
00:36:54.255 --> 00:36:56.170
and she's stressed out
all the time.

802
00:36:56.301 --> 00:36:57.954
If I had one Christmas wish.

803
00:36:58.085 --> 00:37:00.130
it would be for her
to be happy.

804
00:37:00.261 --> 00:37:02.568
Well. you know what.

805
00:37:02.698 --> 00:37:04.831
let's just see what I can do
about that.

806
00:37:04.961 --> 00:37:06.746
After all. I'm pretty good
at fixing things. aren't I?

807
00:37:06.876 --> 00:37:09.270
Really? You're the best.

808
00:37:11.446 --> 00:37:13.100
You're the best. kid.
Hey. you know what?

809
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:14.275
We got some time
before the carnival.

810
00:37:14.406 --> 00:37:15.755
why don't we go over
and deflate

811
00:37:15.885 --> 00:37:17.060
all of Jason's
Christmas decorations?

812
00:37:17.191 --> 00:37:18.105
Come on.
- That sounds naughty.

813
00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.889
Let's do it!

814
00:37:22.457 --> 00:37:25.025
<i>♪ Fa-la-la-la-la.
fa-la-la-la-la ♪</i>

815
00:37:25.155 --> 00:37:28.507
Hey.

816
00:37:28.637 --> 00:37:29.769
Today was awesome.

817
00:37:29.899 --> 00:37:31.379
Can I spend every day
with Papa?

818
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.860
Yes. No. Maybe. I don't know.

819
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.731
What is going on here?

820
00:37:35.862 --> 00:37:36.950
I'm gonna go
get some cookies.

821
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.953
OK. we'll see you
in a little bit.

822
00:37:40.083 --> 00:37:41.171
Is this the Twilight Zone?

823
00:37:41.302 --> 00:37:43.130
More like Groundhog Day.

824
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:44.566
What?

825
00:37:44.697 --> 00:37:46.481
We went shopping together.

826
00:37:46.612 --> 00:37:49.267
I taught her
how to love herself.

827
00:37:49.397 --> 00:37:51.791
And then we went
to the workshop

828
00:37:51.921 --> 00:37:53.445
and fixed
an old radio together.

829
00:37:53.575 --> 00:37:55.229
You let her go
in your workshop?

830
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.535
You never let me go in there.

831
00:37:56.665 --> 00:37:58.928
Now. I've got
a great surprise for you.

832
00:37:59.059 --> 00:38:01.017
You've been working so hard
lately at the hospital.

833
00:38:01.148 --> 00:38:03.542
with Harkin. and all
the volunteer work you do.

834
00:38:03.672 --> 00:38:05.065
You've done so much
for everybody else.

835
00:38:05.195 --> 00:38:06.545
I thought it was time
someone did something for you.

836
00:38:06.675 --> 00:38:08.938
So I called you boss.

837
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:10.636
You're free for the week.

838
00:38:10.766 --> 00:38:14.553
We're going
to the Bahamas tomorrow.

839
00:38:14.683 --> 00:38:16.990
Tomorrow is Christmas.

840
00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.165
I'd like to spend
Christmas at home.

841
00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:21.255
I don't want to be on a plane.
- But--

842
00:38:21.386 --> 00:38:22.604
And those are
really important surgeries

843
00:38:22.735 --> 00:38:23.823
I have next week.

844
00:38:23.953 --> 00:38:25.390
Honey. you need
to have a break.

845
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.174
You don't know what I need.
You never have.

846
00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:29.394
You were always too busy
working to know what I needed.

847
00:38:29.524 --> 00:38:30.786
I did that for you.

848
00:38:30.917 --> 00:38:33.441
No. it wasn't for me.

849
00:38:33.572 --> 00:38:35.225
It was so that you could prove
to the world

850
00:38:35.356 --> 00:38:38.228
and to your father
what a success you were.

851
00:38:38.359 --> 00:38:39.708
You've never loved me.

852
00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:43.233
- That is not true.
- Well. that's how it felt.

853
00:38:43.364 --> 00:38:44.452
Come on. Harkin.

854
00:38:44.583 --> 00:38:46.149
We'll make--
- I want a cookie.

855
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.500
No. we'll make some cookies
at home. OK. honey?

856
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:51.372
Hey B-man. I heard you were
looking for investors.

857
00:38:51.503 --> 00:38:52.330
Let's talk.

858
00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.549
Not the best time. Nina.

859
00:39:02.252 --> 00:39:03.776
Make it quick. Santa.

860
00:39:12.219 --> 00:39:17.442
So what have you learned
so far. Brian?

861
00:39:17.572 --> 00:39:21.707
I've learned how important
my family is to me.

862
00:39:21.837 --> 00:39:25.101
How their happiness
is what matters.

863
00:39:25.232 --> 00:39:28.844
I want to make
Harkin's wish come true.

864
00:39:28.975 --> 00:39:31.934
I want Michelle to be happy.

865
00:39:32.065 --> 00:39:35.416
I want to make her
love me again.

866
00:39:38.027 --> 00:39:40.465
But I--I just don't know how.

867
00:39:40.595 --> 00:39:44.817
Well. you've got six days
to figure it out.

868
00:39:44.947 --> 00:39:46.732
Don't give up.

869
00:39:46.862 --> 00:39:50.475
Christmas is
just around the corner.

870
00:39:50.605 --> 00:39:51.911
Christmas or die.

871
00:39:55.697 --> 00:39:58.744
That is the choice. right?

872
00:40:00.572 --> 00:40:02.922
Afraid so.

873
00:40:03.052 --> 00:40:06.926
Well. then.
I choose Christmas.

874
00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:24.291
"Better off Alone."

875
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:26.293
"Raised by Wolves."

876
00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:28.121
"When Parents Don't Care
About You."

877
00:40:28.251 --> 00:40:30.950
I care.

878
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.691
I'd say I'm more of a bear
than a wolf.

879
00:40:32.821 --> 00:40:34.214
What's that. Papa?

880
00:40:34.344 --> 00:40:36.869
Oh. nothing. honey.

881
00:40:36.999 --> 00:40:38.610
You know. I'd like to get
something really special

882
00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.176
for your mom
for Christmas this year.

883
00:40:40.307 --> 00:40:41.830
What does she like?

884
00:40:41.961 --> 00:40:45.094
She likes food carved
to look like animals.

885
00:40:45.225 --> 00:40:47.357
animals dressed up like food.

886
00:40:47.488 --> 00:40:49.185
she likes pretzels
dipped in frosting.

887
00:40:49.316 --> 00:40:51.144
rolled in sprinkles.

888
00:40:51.274 --> 00:40:52.711
and she likes dancing
in her pajamas

889
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:54.626
to Irish folk songs.

890
00:40:54.756 --> 00:40:55.583
Her favorite is--

891
00:40:55.714 --> 00:40:59.718
♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra

892
00:40:59.848 --> 00:41:03.112
♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-li

893
00:41:03.243 --> 00:41:06.594
♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra

894
00:41:06.725 --> 00:41:09.597
♪ Hush now. don't you cry

895
00:41:09.728 --> 00:41:11.251
How did you know that?

896
00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:13.601
I used to sing it to her
when she was a little girl.

897
00:41:13.732 --> 00:41:15.995
just like my dad sang it to me.

898
00:41:17.953 --> 00:41:19.868
Mostly she likes
helping people.

899
00:41:19.999 --> 00:41:21.870
That's why we have
all those bills.

900
00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:25.047
She's always giving
her money away to charity.

901
00:41:25.178 --> 00:41:27.659
Well. and all those
massive student loans

902
00:41:27.789 --> 00:41:29.095
you made or take out
to teach her

903
00:41:29.225 --> 00:41:31.271
"fiscal responsibility."

904
00:41:31.401 --> 00:41:33.665
Yes. everybody has to learn

905
00:41:33.795 --> 00:41:36.406
that nothing in this life
is for free.

906
00:41:36.537 --> 00:41:38.844
Mom and J.Lo say
that love don't cost a thing.

907
00:41:38.974 --> 00:41:41.020
Oh.

908
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.370
Well. today.

909
00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:44.763
at least
these Christmas cookies

910
00:41:44.893 --> 00:41:45.894
are for free.

911
00:41:46.025 --> 00:41:47.417
With milk?

912
00:41:47.548 --> 00:41:49.289
Just like Santa.

913
00:41:49.419 --> 00:41:52.597

00:41:52.727 --> 00:41:56.296

00:41:56.426 --> 00:42:01.040
♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra

916
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:02.650
Here comes the big finish.
Wait for it.

917
00:42:02.781 --> 00:42:08.090
♪ That's an Irish lullaby

918
00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.487
That always used to make
your mom laugh her head off.

919
00:42:13.618 --> 00:42:14.749
And then it was lights out.

920
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.359
Here we are.

921
00:42:38.991 --> 00:42:40.079
I told you not
to call me today.

922
00:42:40.209 --> 00:42:43.343
I know. sir.
but it's Nina Nishi.

923
00:42:43.473 --> 00:42:44.562
She wants to meet with you.

924
00:42:44.692 --> 00:42:47.260
She's very interested
in investing.

925
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.175
Well. look. I promised Harkin

926
00:42:49.305 --> 00:42:51.394
that I would teach her
how to fix a radio.

927
00:42:51.525 --> 00:42:53.309
<i>Training her to take
over the family business?</i>

928
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.009
Maybe.

929
00:42:57.139 --> 00:42:58.576
That gives me an idea.

930
00:43:03.189 --> 00:43:03.798
Thanks for coming
all the way out.

931
00:43:03.929 --> 00:43:05.234
Yeah.

932
00:43:05.365 --> 00:43:06.714
Oh. that's my granddaughter
there. Harkin.

933
00:43:06.845 --> 00:43:07.628
- Hi.
- I promised her

934
00:43:07.759 --> 00:43:08.586
we'd fix something together.

935
00:43:08.716 --> 00:43:10.936
Oh. that's so sweet.

936
00:43:11.066 --> 00:43:14.113
My grandfather also loved
to fix things.

937
00:43:14.243 --> 00:43:17.246
It's one of the reasons
I'm interested in PC Electric.

938
00:43:17.377 --> 00:43:18.291
It reminds me of him.

939
00:43:18.421 --> 00:43:19.248
Would you like
to have a seat?

940
00:43:19.379 --> 00:43:20.685
Oh. no. go ahead.

941
00:43:20.815 --> 00:43:21.947
Oh. thank you.

942
00:43:22.077 --> 00:43:24.906
Now. I have been
doing some research.

943
00:43:25.037 --> 00:43:26.038
And it's my understanding

944
00:43:26.168 --> 00:43:27.561
that in order to make
whipped cream.

945
00:43:27.692 --> 00:43:29.084
you've got to have
some heavy cream.

946
00:43:29.215 --> 00:43:32.000
a few drops of vanilla.
some powdered sugar.

947
00:43:32.131 --> 00:43:33.349
and you whip it
until you get stiff peaks.

948
00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.221
Am I right? Hmm?

949
00:43:35.351 --> 00:43:37.832
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

950
00:43:37.963 --> 00:43:40.487
Mmm. Oh. so good.

951
00:43:40.618 --> 00:43:43.011
Look. I'm not gonna
waste your time.

952
00:43:43.142 --> 00:43:44.578
I'm gonna be honest with you.

953
00:43:44.709 --> 00:43:46.711
PC Electric is struggling.

954
00:43:46.841 --> 00:43:48.538
We need an investor.

955
00:43:48.669 --> 00:43:51.019
I can stay stuck in the past

956
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.979
and. apparently.
in the present.

957
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:55.284
But if I want
to save my company.

958
00:43:55.415 --> 00:43:57.591
I have to look to the future.

959
00:43:57.722 --> 00:44:00.420
I believe you are
the kind of person

960
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.770
who can lead me to tomorrow.

961
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:04.772
What makes you think that?

962
00:44:04.903 --> 00:44:08.123
Well. like I said.
I've done my research.

963
00:44:08.254 --> 00:44:09.777
You graduated top of your class
at Harvard Business School.

964
00:44:09.908 --> 00:44:11.300
Hm.

965
00:44:11.431 --> 00:44:12.911
All the startup companies
you've invested in.

966
00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:15.653
every one is making strides
in innovation

967
00:44:15.783 --> 00:44:17.655
and in market share.

968
00:44:17.785 --> 00:44:21.049
You know how to work hard.

969
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.486
And you go after what you want.

970
00:44:23.617 --> 00:44:26.011
Well. work is pretty much
all I have going on in my life.

971
00:44:26.141 --> 00:44:28.274
so I better be
good at it. right?

972
00:44:28.404 --> 00:44:32.408
What about your family.
friends. love?

973
00:44:33.801 --> 00:44:37.805
I'm not really good
at that stuff.

974
00:44:37.936 --> 00:44:41.069
It's just easier right now
to just focus on work.

975
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.159
There'll be plenty of time
for family and friends later.

976
00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:48.860
That's what I used to think.
but I was wrong.

977
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:51.776
Sometimes you just gotta
reach out

978
00:44:51.906 --> 00:44:53.821
and eat that cookie.

979
00:44:53.952 --> 00:44:55.997
Oh. yeah.

980
00:44:58.478 --> 00:45:01.481
Oh. wait. Mm-mm. Oh!

981
00:45:01.611 --> 00:45:03.178
Do you like
the cookies I made?

982
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:04.876
You made these?

983
00:45:05.006 --> 00:45:07.966
Oh. my God. they're so--

984
00:45:08.096 --> 00:45:10.011
I'm sorry.
I cannot lie to this face.

985
00:45:10.142 --> 00:45:11.230
They're horrible.

986
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.667
What?

987
00:45:17.845 --> 00:45:19.978
Ew. gross. Papa!

988
00:45:20.108 --> 00:45:21.936
How is this my fault?

989
00:45:22.067 --> 00:45:23.024
It was a mix.

990

993
00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:38.997
I've never seen you
quite so loose. Brian.

994
00:45:39.127 --> 00:45:42.174
What happened to that
tight grip you always had?

995
00:45:42.304 --> 00:45:43.523
It's a lot more fun
when you let go.

996
00:45:43.653 --> 00:45:46.352
Hmm.

997
00:45:46.482 --> 00:45:47.875

998
00:45:48.006 --> 00:45:49.747
Yeah?

999
00:45:49.877 --> 00:45:52.750
I wonder--oh. sorry.

1000
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.491
Have fun.

1001
00:45:55.622 --> 00:45:57.798
Come on. All right. now.
What's this one?

1002
00:45:57.929 --> 00:46:00.670
Oh. I like that. I like that.

1003
00:46:00.801 --> 00:46:02.629
Honey.

1004
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.544
What's the matter. honey?
You look upset.

1005
00:46:04.674 --> 00:46:07.155
It's just...

1006
00:46:07.286 --> 00:46:10.898
My patient. they almost died
during surgery.

1007
00:46:11.029 --> 00:46:12.944
I'm so sorry.

1008
00:46:13.074 --> 00:46:15.381
It's my fault. I--

1009
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:16.643
I could have done
things differently.

1010
00:46:16.774 --> 00:46:17.687
I should--I should be better.

1011
00:46:17.818 --> 00:46:19.733
No.

1012
00:46:19.864 --> 00:46:24.912
You are smart. kind.
and hardworking.

1013
00:46:25.043 --> 00:46:28.524
Maybe I don't say this enough.
but I'm proud of you.

1014
00:46:28.655 --> 00:46:30.004

1015
00:46:33.051 --> 00:46:34.748

1016
00:46:36.706 --> 00:46:38.404

1017
00:46:40.885 --> 00:46:42.930
Not yet.
but the night is young.

1018
00:46:43.061 --> 00:46:43.931
Yeah. go dance.

1019
00:46:49.632 --> 00:46:52.331
Today was
a rough one for her.

1020
00:46:52.461 --> 00:46:54.507
She told me.

1021
00:46:54.637 --> 00:46:56.161
She thinks she's a bad surgeon.

1022
00:46:56.291 --> 00:46:58.990
Ridiculous.
She's one of our best.

1023
00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.383
Her patient had a brain bleed
that no one caught

1024
00:47:01.514 --> 00:47:02.994
until it was almost too late.

1025
00:47:03.124 --> 00:47:05.910
She's too hard on herself.

1026
00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.563
Good thing she has
a father like you.

1027

the most wonderful time
with you today.

1033
00:47:26.539 --> 00:47:29.629
You are a great kid.

but thank you
for watching Harkin

1039
00:47:42.642 --> 00:47:45.950
and for whatever medication
or food substitution

1040
00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.386
that has somehow managed
to shift you

1041
00:47:47.516 --> 00:47:50.041
from Scrooge to Santa.

1042
00:47:50.171 --> 00:47:54.567
Santa is not the saint
some people think he is.

Oh. really?
You know this how?

1044
00:47:56.961 --> 00:47:59.702
Let's just say he has
decked my halls several times.

1045
00:47:59.833 --> 00:48:01.008
thank you very much.

1046
00:48:01.139 --> 00:48:03.532
Oh. OK. well.
the next time you see him.

1047
00:48:03.663 --> 00:48:05.839

and that I'm still waiting

Speaking of things
that are owed.

1050
00:48:12.846 --> 00:48:14.674
I know I wasn't really around
for you that much

1051
00:48:14.804 --> 00:48:17.242
when you were growing up.

1052
00:48:17.372 --> 00:48:19.679
but I am here now.

1053
00:48:19.809 --> 00:48:24.249
and I have a very special

1054
00:48:24.379 --> 00:48:26.686
early Christmas gift
to give you.

1055
00:48:26.816 --> 00:48:30.733
I have paid off your debts
and your student loans.

1056
00:48:36.652 --> 00:48:38.089
How do you know
how much debt I have?

1057
00:48:38.219 --> 00:48:40.308
Well. I happened to look
through your mail earlier.

1058
00:48:40.439 --> 00:48:42.484
You looked through my mail?

1059
00:48:42.615 --> 00:48:43.833
It was just sitting out.
and I thought--

1060
00:48:43.964 --> 00:48:44.573
So you're spying on me?

1061
00:48:44.704 --> 00:48:47.185
No. no. it's just--

1062
00:48:47.315 --> 00:48:49.056
I wanted to do
something nice for you.

1063
00:48:49.187 --> 00:48:50.144
I love you.

1064
00:48:50.275 --> 00:48:52.886
I'm not a spreadsheet. dad.

1065
00:48:53.017 --> 00:48:55.671
You can't just clear up
your debt by paying off mine.

1066
00:48:55.802 --> 00:48:58.413
That's--
- What do you want then?

1067
00:48:58.544 --> 00:49:00.459
I don't want your money.

1068
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:02.504
I just--I want a dad

1069
00:49:02.635 --> 00:49:03.723
who doesn't have to ask me
that question.

1070
00:49:06.987 --> 00:49:10.382
- Hey. come on. You ready?
- OK.

1071
00:49:10.512 --> 00:49:12.558
Let's go do all of our fun
Christmas traditions. OK?

1072
00:49:14.647 --> 00:49:17.476
I am gonna figure this out.

1073
00:49:17.606 --> 00:49:18.912
You hear me. Santa?

1074
00:49:19.043 --> 00:49:21.219
I'm gonna make her happy.
and I'm gonna

1075
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:22.785
make her love me again.

1076
00:49:22.916 --> 00:49:24.265
I'm gonna show you--

1077
00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:33.927
Oh. you sure showed me. huh?

1078
00:49:34.058 --> 00:49:35.668
Just shut your chimney hole.

1079
00:49:38.845 --> 00:49:41.152
Dr. Angeloni. I was hoping
you could do me a favor.

1080
00:49:41.282 --> 00:49:43.023
Papa!

1081
00:49:43.154 --> 00:49:44.459
- Harkin!
- I don't understand.

1082
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:45.939
That surgery's been
on the schedule for weeks.

1083
00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:47.462
I don't need a day off.

1084
00:49:47.593 --> 00:49:49.421
Yes. Dr. Angeloni.
whatever you think is best.

1085
00:49:49.551 --> 00:49:51.727
Of course. yeah.
I'll see you tonight.

1086
00:49:51.858 --> 00:49:53.512
What's wrong?

1087
00:49:53.642 --> 00:49:55.949
I was just coming here to ask
if you could watch Harkin

1088
00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.778
during my surgery. but it just
got taken off the schedule.

1089
00:49:58.908 --> 00:50:00.084
I don't get it.

1090
00:50:00.214 --> 00:50:01.955
I'm sure they have
their reasons.

1091
00:50:02.086 --> 00:50:03.957
Yeah. maybe Dr. Angeloni
doesn't think I'm good enough.

1092
00:50:04.088 --> 00:50:06.307
Well. I know for a fact
that's not true.

1093
00:50:06.438 --> 00:50:08.440
Maybe they just wanted
to give you a little time off.

1094
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:11.660
OK. well. we don't need
to bother you now.

1095
00:50:11.791 --> 00:50:12.922
Why don't we get going?

1096
00:50:13.053 --> 00:50:15.099
No. no. no. wait. wait.
Please. please.

1097
00:50:15.229 --> 00:50:16.535
Maybe we could spend
the day together.

1098
00:50:16.665 --> 00:50:18.798
I could ditch work and--

1099
00:50:18.928 --> 00:50:21.453
and we can go out and do
some of that Christmas stuff

1100
00:50:21.583 --> 00:50:23.411
that you guys always do.

1101
00:50:23.542 --> 00:50:26.632
You'd ditch work
to do Christmas stuff?

1102
00:50:26.762 --> 00:50:29.330
Or other stuff.
whatever you like.

1103
00:50:29.461 --> 00:50:31.985
I want to go sledding
and sing Christmas carols

1104
00:50:32.116 --> 00:50:35.075
and bake cookies
and eat cookies and--

1105
00:50:35.206 --> 00:50:37.034
That sounds like a great day.

1106
00:50:37.164 --> 00:50:38.122
What is this?
What's going on?

1107
00:50:38.252 --> 00:50:39.601
Are you dying?

1108
00:50:39.732 --> 00:50:41.299
I hope not.

1109
00:50:41.429 --> 00:50:45.390
Look.

1110
00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:48.871
I know you don't think
I know who you are

1111
00:50:49.002 --> 00:50:51.135
or what you need.

1112
00:50:51.265 --> 00:50:53.485
You're right.

1113
00:50:53.615 --> 00:50:55.791
I was so busy trying
to give you a better tomorrow

1114
00:50:55.922 --> 00:50:59.186
I wasn't in any of your todays.

1115
00:50:59.317 --> 00:51:01.406
But I'm here now.

1116
00:51:01.536 --> 00:51:04.061
Today is your day.

1117
00:51:04.191 --> 00:51:05.758
Show me who you are.

1118
00:51:07.716 --> 00:51:08.804
OK.

1119
00:51:08.935 --> 00:51:11.285
OK.

1120
00:51:11.416 --> 00:51:12.678
Where to?

1121
00:51:14.941 --> 00:51:16.595
You'll see.

1122
00:51:16.725 --> 00:51:18.553
Oh. and you'll need
different clothes.

1123
00:51:30.348 --> 00:51:31.523
Ah. Thank you.

1124
00:51:33.873 --> 00:51:35.048
Hi. These are really big.

1125
00:51:39.008 --> 00:51:41.272
There you are. Thank you.
Let's move on.

1126
00:51:41.402 --> 00:51:42.969
You know.
that was actually kind of fun.

1127
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:43.883
- Yeah. you were amazing.
- Yeah.

1128
00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:49.454
Yeah. Jet.

1129
00:51:51.717 --> 00:51:52.805
- Just wait a second.
- Yeah. OK.

1130
00:51:55.286 --> 00:51:57.244
Guys. I have to stop
by the shop

1131
00:51:57.375 --> 00:51:58.506
before we go ice skating.

1132
00:51:58.637 --> 00:51:59.681
Why?

1133
00:51:59.812 --> 00:52:00.856
Just a little work thing.

1134
00:52:00.987 --> 00:52:02.423
A little work thing?

1135
00:52:02.554 --> 00:52:04.599
Yeah. well.
there's this investor in town

1136
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:05.948
and I have to meet with her.

1137
00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:07.167
You guys can play video games
while we wait.

1138
00:52:07.298 --> 00:52:08.560
Yay!

1139
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:09.691
I thought you said
today was just about us.

1140
00:52:09.822 --> 00:52:11.171
that you weren't going to work.

1141
00:52:11.302 --> 00:52:12.520
I did say that.
but this just came up.

1142
00:52:12.651 --> 00:52:13.913
Something always
just comes up.

1143
00:52:14.043 --> 00:52:15.306
Yeah. and how do you think
I paid

1144
00:52:15.436 --> 00:52:17.177
for all the donations
we just made?

1145
00:52:17.308 --> 00:52:19.353
You have to earn your gifts
with hard work and sacrifice.

1146
00:52:19.484 --> 00:52:21.964
When will you understand that?
- Oh. I do.

1147
00:52:22.095 --> 00:52:24.402
I love my job and I have
sacrificed for my career.

1148
00:52:24.532 --> 00:52:26.099
but never at the expense
of my family

1149
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.969
and never on Christmas Eve.

1150
00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.841
Fine. I won't go.

1151
00:52:28.971 --> 00:52:31.757
Maybe one day I'll be able
to forget all of the times

1152
00:52:31.887 --> 00:52:35.717
that you chose work over me.
but today is not that day.

1153
00:52:40.374 --> 00:52:41.941
I'm trying.

1154
00:52:42.071 --> 00:52:43.943
Yeah. well. try harder.

1155
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:51.168
Jet. I'm not gonna make it.

1156
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:53.518
Oh. come on.

1157
00:52:57.652 --> 00:53:01.613
I am not giving up.

1158
00:53:15.366 --> 00:53:17.281
There you go. Yep.
Looks really good.

1159
00:53:33.079 --> 00:53:34.298
- For you.
- You can just--

1160
00:53:34.428 --> 00:53:36.517
You know what--in his pipe
and smoke it.

1161
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.683
Do you remember
that music box you gave me

1162
00:54:11.813 --> 00:54:13.250
when I was 12?

1163
00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:14.338
The one with the clock on it?

1164
00:54:14.468 --> 00:54:16.035
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1165
00:54:16.165 --> 00:54:17.863
My dad found it
at a yard sale.

1166
00:54:17.993 --> 00:54:19.647
We fixed it together.

1167
00:54:19.778 --> 00:54:21.649
It's a very valuable collectible.

1168
00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.913
That's why you were so mad
at me when I broke it.

1169
00:54:25.044 --> 00:54:27.351
Gosh. I begged you
to fix it for me.

1170
00:54:27.481 --> 00:54:30.179
but you never had the time.

1171
00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:33.400
I'm sorry.

1172
00:54:33.531 --> 00:54:36.490
I got the time now.

1173
00:54:36.621 --> 00:54:38.231
I gave it away years ago.

1174
00:54:46.283 --> 00:54:49.851
All I ever wanted
was for you to love me.

1175
00:54:49.982 --> 00:54:52.724
Oh. honey. I do love you.

1176
00:54:52.854 --> 00:54:54.116
I always did.

1177
00:54:54.247 --> 00:54:56.597
I wish I could believe that.

1178
00:54:56.728 --> 00:54:59.644
It's just too late.

1179
00:54:59.774 --> 00:55:01.646
You can't make up
for lost time.

1180
00:55:01.776 --> 00:55:02.821
What is it gonna take for me

1181
00:55:02.951 --> 00:55:04.039
to prove to you
that I love you.

1182
00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:07.042
that I am ready
to be a good father.

1183
00:55:07.173 --> 00:55:10.655
the kind of father who deserves
to be loved again?

1184
00:55:10.785 --> 00:55:13.135
Can you go back in time
and fix that clock?

1185
00:55:17.618 --> 00:55:19.098
I didn't think so.

1186
00:55:27.106 --> 00:55:29.630
We'll just see about that.

1187
00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:34.548
Well. that was a surprise.

1188
00:55:34.679 --> 00:55:35.767
I didn't want to wait
another minute.

1189
00:55:35.897 --> 00:55:37.377
I got it.

1190
00:55:37.508 --> 00:55:39.597
I find that clock. I fix it.

1191
00:55:39.727 --> 00:55:41.468
I give it to her.
then she knows that I love her.

1192
00:55:41.599 --> 00:55:43.427
Then she loves me too.
And then I get to live.

1193
00:55:43.557 --> 00:55:45.167
You see. I get it now.

1194
00:55:45.298 --> 00:55:47.126
The meaning of Christmas.
the meaning of life.

1195
00:55:47.256 --> 00:55:49.389
it's love.

1196
00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.652
My love. her love.
Harkin's love.

1197
00:55:51.783 --> 00:55:52.958
Love is everything.

1198
00:55:53.088 --> 00:55:54.612
You're right. it is.

1199
00:55:54.742 --> 00:55:56.440
But there's something else
you should know about--

1200
00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:57.745
oh.

1201
00:55:57.876 --> 00:56:00.531
Jet. I have
every confidence in you.

1202
00:56:00.661 --> 00:56:03.229
You are my number one guy.

1203
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.579
Now. this was
a limited edition. and--

1204
00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:07.102
I know they made
several of them. though.

1205
00:56:07.233 --> 00:56:09.670
So you'll be able to find one.
and buy it.

1206
00:56:09.801 --> 00:56:12.978
no matter what the condition
and no matter what the cost.

1207
00:56:13.108 --> 00:56:14.849
Are you OK?

1208
00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.242
This isn't like you.

1209
00:56:16.373 --> 00:56:17.765
Is there something
you're not telling me?

1210
00:56:17.896 --> 00:56:19.463
Oh. my God. are you dying?

1211
00:56:19.593 --> 00:56:21.682
- Not today.
- OK.

1212
00:56:21.813 --> 00:56:24.250
Oh. and I need it
for the carnival tonight.

1213
00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:26.513
Chop. chop.
- Yes. sir.

1214
00:56:26.644 --> 00:56:27.993
- I'll text it to you.
- OK.

1215
00:56:28.123 --> 00:56:29.690
Ah. there you go.

1216
00:56:29.821 --> 00:56:31.953
And this one.

1217
00:56:32.084 --> 00:56:34.347
Oh. I have an idea
for that one.

1218
00:56:34.478 --> 00:56:35.914
We have something very special
for you. young man.

1219
00:56:39.787 --> 00:56:41.354
Perfect.

1220
00:56:42.616 --> 00:56:43.791
Hi.
- Hi.

1221
00:56:43.922 --> 00:56:45.053
Really surprised me
this year.

1222
00:56:45.184 --> 00:56:47.055
So here you are. young man.

1223
00:56:47.186 --> 00:56:49.188
This is great. yes.
- Sure to warm you up.

1224
00:56:49.318 --> 00:56:50.494
Let me come around
and help you.

1225
00:56:50.624 --> 00:56:52.365
Come on. There you go.

1226
00:56:57.326 --> 00:56:59.198
Oh. I needed this.

1227
00:56:59.328 --> 00:57:00.591
Wow. I don't know
why I don't have

1228
00:57:00.721 --> 00:57:01.940
one of these in my office.

1229
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:04.464
- Can I have one?
- Sure. why not. kid?

1230
00:57:04.595 --> 00:57:06.901
Oh. no. Dad.
She is eight years old.

1231
00:57:07.032 --> 00:57:09.469
She doesn't need
a massage chair.

1232
00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.036
Have you watched
the news lately?

1233
00:57:11.166 --> 00:57:14.256
Climate change. inflation.
supply chain issues

1234
00:57:14.387 --> 00:57:16.520
for Pokémon cards.

1235
00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:18.739
It's a very stressful time
to be a kid these days.

1236
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:20.872
She does have a point.

1237
00:57:21.002 --> 00:57:22.961
You still don't need
a massage chair. OK?

1238
00:57:25.442 --> 00:57:26.921
I wish this day
would never end.

1239
00:57:27.052 --> 00:57:29.533
Don't say that.

1240
00:57:29.663 --> 00:57:32.100
Because then
Christmas wouldn't come.

1241
00:57:32.231 --> 00:57:35.582
and you'd miss
all those presents from Santa.

1242
00:57:35.713 --> 00:57:37.845
Oh. right.
I've been very good this year.

1243
00:57:37.976 --> 00:57:39.804
I'm going to get
a lot of presents.

1244
00:57:39.934 --> 00:57:41.501
Oh. you really think so?

1245
00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:49.422
It has been
a really wonderful day.

1246
00:57:49.553 --> 00:57:52.207
It's been a long time
since I felt part of a family.

1247
00:57:52.338 --> 00:57:54.862
I love you.

1248
00:57:54.993 --> 00:57:56.168
Surprise!

1249
00:57:56.298 --> 00:57:58.475
Oh. Nina. Hi.
What are you doing here?

1250
00:57:58.605 --> 00:57:59.867
Well. Jet told me
you were busy.

1251
00:57:59.998 --> 00:58:01.739
but he slipped up and said
you were at the store.

1252
00:58:01.869 --> 00:58:05.133
so I thought I'd swing by
so we could talk business.

1253
00:58:05.264 --> 00:58:08.049
I've run the numbers and I'm
super interested in investing.

1254
00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:10.225
- Who is this?
- This is Nina Nishi.

1255
00:58:10.356 --> 00:58:12.401
She's--she's--
well. a possible investor.

1256
00:58:12.532 --> 00:58:15.404
Gosh. I--I would love
to be in business with you.

1257
00:58:15.535 --> 00:58:17.232
but today I promised my
daughter and my granddaughter

1258
00:58:17.363 --> 00:58:18.625
that we would spend
the day together.

1259
00:58:18.756 --> 00:58:22.499
And I've broken
a lot of promises in the past.

1260
00:58:22.629 --> 00:58:24.370
I'm not gonna do that anymore.

1261
00:58:24.501 --> 00:58:26.590
So I hope you understand.
- Wow.

1262
00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.461
From everything
I heard about you.

1263
00:58:28.592 --> 00:58:31.682
this was not
what I was expecting.

1264
00:58:31.812 --> 00:58:35.207
You're very lucky to have
a dad that shows up for you.

1265
00:58:35.337 --> 00:58:37.949
Yeah. I am.

1266
00:58:39.211 --> 00:58:40.473
I'll talk to Jet.

1267
00:58:40.604 --> 00:58:43.128
We'll schedule something
for after the holidays.

1268
00:58:43.258 --> 00:58:44.999
- Great.
- Wait. wait.

1269
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:47.915
Will you just wait--
wait a second?

1270
00:58:48.046 --> 00:58:50.875
Go. meet with her.

1271
00:58:51.005 --> 00:58:52.267
- But honey. I--
- Listen. I know

1272
00:58:52.398 --> 00:58:54.008
that the business
has been struggling.

1273
00:58:54.139 --> 00:58:56.010
And Harkin and I can just sit
in the massage chairs.

1274
00:58:56.141 --> 00:58:58.578
Are you sure?

1275
00:58:58.709 --> 00:59:00.145
Of course.

1276
00:59:02.234 --> 00:59:04.236
I don't deserve
a daughter like you.

1277
00:59:04.366 --> 00:59:05.672
Yesterday. I would have
agreed with you.

1278
00:59:05.803 --> 00:59:09.197
But today--today. maybe you do.

1279
00:59:09.328 --> 00:59:11.983
Go. We'll be right here.
- OK.

1280
00:59:12.113 --> 00:59:13.811
Nina?
- Yes.

1281
00:59:13.941 --> 00:59:16.204
- All right.
- Thanks for waiting.

1282
00:59:16.335 --> 00:59:18.380
Lower back.

1283
00:59:18.511 --> 00:59:19.773
Whoa. that--
yeah. that feels good.

1284
00:59:19.904 --> 00:59:21.340
Oh!

1285
00:59:26.388 --> 00:59:27.694
You know
what I just realized?

1286
00:59:27.825 --> 00:59:30.088
This is a Christmas carnival.
and there's no games

1287
00:59:30.218 --> 00:59:32.612
or prizes.
and there's no Santa.

1288
00:59:32.743 --> 00:59:34.005
You should dress up
as Santa. Papa.

1289
00:59:34.135 --> 00:59:35.397
Yes.

1290
00:59:35.528 --> 00:59:36.442
That's never gonna happen.

1291
00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:37.748
Please.

1292
00:59:37.878 --> 00:59:39.793
A man must hold on
to some dignities.

1293
00:59:39.924 --> 00:59:42.100
and not dressing as Santa
is one of mine.

1294
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:44.189
Even the Grinch
dressed up as Santa.

1295
00:59:44.319 --> 00:59:46.365
My father dressed as Santa
every year.

1296
00:59:46.495 --> 00:59:48.236
And I am not my father.

1297
00:59:48.367 --> 00:59:49.803
I am no Santa.

1298
00:59:49.934 --> 00:59:51.326
If you say so.

1299
00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:55.809
Want to get some snacks?
- Yeah.

1300
00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:57.202
Let's go.

1301
00:59:57.332 --> 00:59:59.987
Jet. where are you?

1302
01:00:00.118 --> 01:00:01.249
If you're not here
in ten minutes.

1303
01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.164
I swear I'm gonna fire you.

1304
01:00:03.295 --> 01:00:04.339
No. I don't mean it.

1305
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:06.951
Just hurry!

1306
01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:08.953
You know. I'm sick
of that martini.

1307
01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:12.173
Just--may I have some gin
on the rocks?

1308
01:00:12.304 --> 01:00:14.915
Make it a double.

1309
01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:17.222
Merry Christmas. Brian.

1310
01:00:17.352 --> 01:00:18.615
It isn't Christmas
until tomorrow. is it?

1311
01:00:18.745 --> 01:00:21.313
Sorry. I just wanted to--

1312
01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:22.575
And tomorrow never comes.
does it?

1313
01:00:22.706 --> 01:00:24.446
It's always just today.

1314
01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:27.058
Today. over and over again.

1315
01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:30.017
And today is my last day.

1316
01:00:30.148 --> 01:00:31.366
My last day.

1317
01:00:31.497 --> 01:00:33.020
Do you understand?

1318
01:00:33.151 --> 01:00:34.021
Are you OK?

1319
01:00:34.152 --> 01:00:35.544
No. I'm not.

1320
01:00:35.675 --> 01:00:37.938
I--I want more time.

1321
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:40.941
I have to get that clock.
that--that music box clock.

1322
01:00:41.072 --> 01:00:44.031
That will get me to tomorrow.
which actually is Christmas.

1323
01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:48.427
You're right.
It's not Christmas yet.

1324
01:00:48.557 --> 01:00:51.778
I hope you find everything
that you're looking for. Brian.

1325
01:00:57.262 --> 01:00:58.655
Who was that?

1326
01:00:58.785 --> 01:01:01.179
It's just a ghost
of Christmas past

1327
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:04.182
to remind me
what a horrible man I am.

1328
01:01:04.312 --> 01:01:05.574
Why is there no Santa
at this party?

1329
01:01:05.705 --> 01:01:07.576
Papa has dignities.

1330
01:01:07.707 --> 01:01:09.143
OK.

1331
01:01:09.274 --> 01:01:10.536
I've been thinking.

1332
01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.364
I don't want to invest
in your company.

1333
01:01:12.494 --> 01:01:13.670
Of course not.

1334
01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.323
- I want to buy it.
- Buy it?

1335
01:01:15.454 --> 01:01:16.542
Yes. the whole thing.

1336
01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:17.586
It's the only thing
that makes sense

1337
01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:18.762
for me and for you.

1338
01:01:18.892 --> 01:01:20.241
Just think.

1339
01:01:20.372 --> 01:01:22.591
you won't have to worry about
money ever again.

1340
01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:24.593
and you can spend
more time with your family.

1341
01:01:24.724 --> 01:01:26.160
OK.

1342
01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:27.771
- Really?
- Really.

1343
01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:30.425
But. Dad. this company.
it's your whole life.

1344
01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:31.775
Well. maybe it's time
it wasn't anymore.

1345
01:01:31.905 --> 01:01:34.429
I'm here! I've got it!
Please. don't fire me.

1346
01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.388
- Jet.
- Finally.

1347
01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:38.216
Michelle--

1348
01:01:38.346 --> 01:01:40.261
Mm-hmm?

1349
01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:43.177
I know I was never
the father you deserved.

1350
01:01:43.308 --> 01:01:44.613
And you did deserve better.

1351
01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:47.094
And I promise I'm going
to be better from now on.

1352
01:01:47.225 --> 01:01:51.098
because I'm proud of you.
and I love you.

1353
01:01:51.229 --> 01:01:55.407
and I hope this gift
shows you how much I care.

1354
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.715
It's a clock.

1355
01:01:58.845 --> 01:02:00.673
Yes. it's--
it's the music box clock

1356
01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:02.283
I gave you when you were 12.

1357
01:02:02.414 --> 01:02:03.676
Yeah. the one
that you wouldn't

1358
01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:05.156
help me fix when it broke.

1359
01:02:05.286 --> 01:02:07.027
No. no--I know. I--I--

1360
01:02:07.158 --> 01:02:09.073
but--but--but it's fixed now.

1361
01:02:09.203 --> 01:02:10.465
I mean. I found
a new one for you.

1362
01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:11.945
I got this for you.

1363
01:02:14.121 --> 01:02:15.949
Just open it.

1364
01:02:18.256 --> 01:02:20.084
Thanks.

1365
01:02:20.214 --> 01:02:22.869
You said that if I fixed it.
we could have a second chance.

1366
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.436
You said if I gave you this.

1367
01:02:24.566 --> 01:02:25.959
it would prove
that I loved you.

1368
01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:29.093
I'm just gonna let
you guys talk in private.

1369
01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:32.270
I never said that.

1370
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.750
Yes. you did. on the balcony.

1371
01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.968
I've never been
on the balcony.

1372
01:02:35.099 --> 01:02:36.883
Yes. you were.

1373
01:02:37.014 --> 01:02:38.406
I tracked it down today.

1374
01:02:38.537 --> 01:02:41.409
And--and Jet drove all over
town trying to find it.

1375
01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.715
Oh. so Jet got this for me.

1376
01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:45.065
No. we--well. yes. but--

1377
01:02:45.196 --> 01:02:47.415
It was a lot of driving.
all those last-minute shoppers.

1378
01:02:47.546 --> 01:02:48.503
Well. thank you. Jet.

1379
01:02:48.634 --> 01:02:50.114
I appreciate your effort.

1380
01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:53.465
Come on. honey.

1381
01:02:57.295 --> 01:02:59.036
I'm guessing that didn't go
how you had hoped.

1382
01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:01.690
I can fix this.

1383
01:03:01.821 --> 01:03:03.431
Hey. everyone.
can I have your attention?

1384
01:03:03.562 --> 01:03:05.216
Come on in here. Don't be shy.

1385
01:03:05.346 --> 01:03:06.478
What is she doing?

1386
01:03:06.608 --> 01:03:09.786
Hi.
Merry Christmas. everyone.

1387
01:03:09.916 --> 01:03:11.222
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

1388
01:03:11.352 --> 01:03:14.138
My name is Nina Nishi.

1389
01:03:14.268 --> 01:03:16.227
And I just wanted to say
thank you

1390
01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:17.794
to our generous hosts.

1391
01:03:17.924 --> 01:03:19.970
Brian Conway and PC Electric.

1392
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.623
for all the hard work
they've done.

1393
01:03:21.754 --> 01:03:22.842
Come on up here. Brian.

1394
01:03:22.973 --> 01:03:24.061
Come on up.

1395
01:03:24.191 --> 01:03:26.193
Come on. Come on up.

1396
01:03:26.324 --> 01:03:29.240
This man has worked so hard
over the years

1397
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:31.155
to build this company up

1398
01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:32.765
and to give back
to the community.

1399
01:03:32.896 --> 01:03:36.334
which is why after all that
hard work and sacrifice.

1400
01:03:36.464 --> 01:03:38.597
he's finally gonna
reward himself

1401
01:03:38.727 --> 01:03:40.817
by selling me the company.

1402
01:03:40.947 --> 01:03:42.949
What did she say?

1403
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.385
What are you doing?

1404
01:03:44.516 --> 01:03:45.691
I know we haven't
discussed the details.

1405
01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.432
but I'm just so excited.
I couldn't wait.

1406
01:03:47.562 --> 01:03:51.262
And don't worry. I will be
a very generous boss.

1407
01:03:51.392 --> 01:03:53.525
if and when I fire you

1408
01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:55.005
after breaking the company
into pieces

1409
01:03:55.135 --> 01:03:56.571
and selling off the parts.

1410
01:03:56.702 --> 01:03:58.095
This is not
what we discussed.

1411
01:03:58.225 --> 01:03:59.792
This is the only thing
that makes business sense.

1412
01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:01.359
- Listen. everyone.
- Brian.

1413
01:04:01.489 --> 01:04:02.534
There's been
a misunderstanding.

1414
01:04:02.664 --> 01:04:04.275
- But--
- No one is getting fired.

1415
01:04:04.405 --> 01:04:06.755
Please. go back to the party
and enjoy yourselves.

1416
01:04:06.886 --> 01:04:08.583
And you. just get out.
Go. Hit the bricks.

1417
01:04:10.455 --> 01:04:12.544
Did you ask Dr. Angeloni

1418
01:04:12.674 --> 01:04:13.414
to take me off
the schedule today?

1419
01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:15.416
No.

1420
01:04:15.547 --> 01:04:16.940
OK. yes. yes.
but only because--

1421
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:18.811
That patient almost died
during the surgery.

1422
01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:20.030
If I had done the surgery--

1423
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.683
The same thing
would have happened.

1424
01:04:21.814 --> 01:04:23.860
Well. thank you for having
faith in me as a surgeon.

1425
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.862
No. that patient had
a brain bleed.

1426
01:04:25.992 --> 01:04:27.602
It doesn't matter who operated.

1427
01:04:27.733 --> 01:04:29.561
What--what are
you talking about?

1428
01:04:29.691 --> 01:04:31.171
You know what? I don't care.

1429
01:04:31.302 --> 01:04:33.130
I thought you had changed.

1430
01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:35.219
You sure fooled me.

1431
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:37.308
You're right.
I wasn't there for you.

1432
01:04:37.438 --> 01:04:38.309
I don't deserve you.

1433
01:04:38.439 --> 01:04:40.137
I'm a horrible father.

1434
01:04:40.267 --> 01:04:41.703
And I'm a horrible boss.

1435
01:04:41.834 --> 01:04:44.489
And I'm a horrible human being.

1436
01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:45.969
Oh. you're right.

1437
01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:47.579
You're all right.

1438
01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:54.020
Oh. my God.

1439
01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:56.109
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Dad.

1440
01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.806
I'm sorry.

1441
01:04:57.937 --> 01:04:59.199
I'm sorry.
- Papa.

1442
01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:00.374
Hey. Dad. Dad. hey. Hey.

1443
01:05:00.505 --> 01:05:02.855
- Papa. Papa.
- I'm sorry.

1444
01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:05.771
- Are you OK. Papa?
- Dad. stay with me. please.

1445
01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.555
Papa.

1446
01:05:07.686 --> 01:05:10.384
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

1447
01:05:21.743 --> 01:05:24.137
I tried.

1448
01:05:24.268 --> 01:05:25.747
I know.

1449
01:05:25.878 --> 01:05:30.056
The worst thing isn't that
I won't wake up tomorrow.

1450
01:05:30.187 --> 01:05:31.797
It's that everybody else will.

1451
01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.758
They'll wake up
on Christmas Day

1452
01:05:36.889 --> 01:05:39.457
with the wreckage
I left behind.

1453
01:05:39.587 --> 01:05:42.808
A failing business.
My broken family.

1454
01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:49.641
I wish I could have
one more day.

1455
01:05:49.771 --> 01:05:50.903
not that I could live
any longer.

1456
01:05:51.034 --> 01:05:53.340
but that they would be OK.

1457
01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:55.516
have the better life
I wasted so much time

1458
01:05:55.647 --> 01:05:57.910
trying to give them.

1459
01:05:58.041 --> 01:06:00.826
I gave you 12 chances.

1460
01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.306
I know.

1461
01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:09.966
Or did you?

1462
01:06:10.096 --> 01:06:12.664
You've only given me
11 chances.

1463
01:06:12.794 --> 01:06:14.535
It wasn't until
after the first death

1464
01:06:14.666 --> 01:06:16.624
that you promised me 12 days
to get it right.

1465
01:06:16.755 --> 01:06:18.626
Now. now. now. wait a minute.

1466
01:06:18.757 --> 01:06:21.716
Please. give me that day.

1467
01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:23.631
One more day.

1468
01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:26.373
Please. I can fix this.

1469
01:06:26.504 --> 01:06:28.288
I know I can.

1470
01:06:28.419 --> 01:06:30.682
I'll make a deal with you.

1471
01:06:30.812 --> 01:06:35.600
I'll give you
that one more day. but...

1472
01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:39.734
only to set things right.

1473
01:06:39.865 --> 01:06:41.867
not to keep living.

1474
01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:46.524
When the day is done.
so is your life.

1475
01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.223
Deal?

1476
01:06:52.704 --> 01:06:55.576
I'll take it.

1477
01:07:04.107 --> 01:07:06.283
Merry Christmas. Brian.

1478
01:07:06.413 --> 01:07:09.721
This looks...

1479
01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:12.550
great. Jason.

1480
01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.594
Well. thank you. Brian.

1481
01:07:16.858 --> 01:07:18.643
You think you could do me
a little favor?

1482
01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:19.731
Sure. I--I--

1483
01:07:19.861 --> 01:07:21.646
I can try.

1484
01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:27.695
Whoa. whoa. whoa. be careful.
Slippery patch.

1485
01:07:27.826 --> 01:07:30.481
Bless you. sir.

1486
01:07:30.611 --> 01:07:31.569
Oh. please be careful.

1487
01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:33.353
There's a slippery patch
right there.

1488
01:07:33.484 --> 01:07:35.355
Merry Christmas. folks.

1489
01:07:35.486 --> 01:07:38.141
- After you.
- Thank you.

1490
01:07:38.271 --> 01:07:39.751
Merry Christmas.

1491
01:07:42.971 --> 01:07:44.451
Good morning. Mr. Conway.

1492
01:07:44.582 --> 01:07:46.410
It is. isn't it?
This is for you.

1493
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.325
Gingerbread latte
with extra cinnamon.

1494
01:07:48.455 --> 01:07:49.152
Your favorite. yes?

1495
01:07:49.282 --> 01:07:50.414
How did you know that?

1496
01:07:52.546 --> 01:07:53.634
How did he know that?

1497
01:07:53.765 --> 01:07:56.333
All that is to say

1498
01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:58.074
that even though it may not
have seemed like it.

1499
01:07:58.204 --> 01:08:01.816
I have been listening
and learning.

1500
01:08:01.947 --> 01:08:04.384
And you were right.

1501
01:08:04.515 --> 01:08:06.865
We should change our strategy.

1502
01:08:06.995 --> 01:08:10.564
If we--I mean.

1503
01:08:10.695 --> 01:08:13.872
if this company is to survive.

1504
01:08:14.002 --> 01:08:16.440
then we have to start
thinking about the future.

1505
01:08:16.570 --> 01:08:18.964
Dale. that is why
I am approving

1506
01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:20.400
your new marketing
and branding campaign.

1507
01:08:20.531 --> 01:08:23.447
Really?

1508
01:08:23.577 --> 01:08:24.665
But how are we gonna
pay for all this?

1509
01:08:24.796 --> 01:08:26.624
Well. I know
that Nina Nishi's in town.

1510
01:08:26.754 --> 01:08:27.886
and she's interested
in investing.

1511
01:08:28.016 --> 01:08:30.845
I've scheduled a meeting
with her this afternoon.

1512
01:08:30.976 --> 01:08:32.238
And something else.

1513
01:08:33.979 --> 01:08:36.373
I would like to thank
each and every one of you

1514
01:08:36.503 --> 01:08:39.941
for your years of devotion
and your hard work

1515
01:08:40.072 --> 01:08:44.163
by giving you all a 20% raise

1516
01:08:44.294 --> 01:08:46.600
and a month's salary
as a bonus.

1517
01:08:46.731 --> 01:08:51.127
Oh. my God.

1518
01:08:51.257 --> 01:08:52.693
Well done.
Thank you. thank you.

1519
01:08:52.824 --> 01:08:54.695
Except for you. Jet.

1520
01:08:56.784 --> 01:08:59.135
You are getting
an even bigger raise

1521
01:08:59.265 --> 01:09:02.834
because I'm promoting you
to COO.

1522
01:09:04.749 --> 01:09:07.055
After all. you've been looking
after me and this company

1523
01:09:07.186 --> 01:09:10.494
for years. and if--

1524
01:09:10.624 --> 01:09:12.931
if anything
were to happen to me.

1525
01:09:13.061 --> 01:09:15.238
I know PC Electric
would be in good hands.

1526
01:09:16.935 --> 01:09:18.241
I won't let you down. sir.

1527
01:09:18.371 --> 01:09:19.546
Please. call me Brian.

1528
01:09:19.677 --> 01:09:20.591
Yes. sir.

1529
01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:22.027
I mean. Brian. sir.

1530
01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:24.769
I mean. Brian.

1531
01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:26.074
All right.

1532
01:09:26.205 --> 01:09:27.902
You should work on that.

1533
01:09:28.033 --> 01:09:29.426
Well. what are you all
sitting there for?

1534
01:09:29.556 --> 01:09:32.690
It's Christmas Eve. Get home.
Start celebrating.

1535
01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:34.561
Oh. oh. and if you're
interested at all.

1536
01:09:34.692 --> 01:09:37.695
please come to the Christmas
carnival tonight.

1537
01:09:37.825 --> 01:09:39.697
Bring your families.
Bring your friends.

1538
01:09:39.827 --> 01:09:41.264
It's gonna be fun.

1539
01:09:41.394 --> 01:09:44.267
Merry Christmas.

1540
01:09:44.397 --> 01:09:46.225
I have just a few last things
I'd like you to do

1541
01:09:46.356 --> 01:09:48.314
as my assistant.
if you don't mind.

1542
01:09:48.445 --> 01:09:50.142
- Of course not.
- OK.

1543
01:09:50.273 --> 01:09:55.930
Now these. I want you to get
to the carnival for tonight.

1544
01:09:56.061 --> 01:09:58.629
And these. I'd like to be
ordered and delivered

1545
01:09:58.759 --> 01:09:59.934
to the house ASAP.

1546
01:10:00.065 --> 01:10:02.285
I'm on it. Brian.

1547
01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.464
Thank you.

1548
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.729
- Papa!
- Harkin.

1549
01:10:14.079 --> 01:10:15.341
What a wonderful way
to start the day.

1550
01:10:15.472 --> 01:10:18.431
And how is my favorite
sunshine sparkle unicorn?

1551
01:10:18.562 --> 01:10:20.303
Awesome.

1552
01:10:20.433 --> 01:10:21.695
I have a surgery
scheduled today.

1553
01:10:21.826 --> 01:10:23.131
and the nanny just called.

1554
01:10:23.262 --> 01:10:25.656
Well. I can take care of her
while you work.

1555
01:10:25.786 --> 01:10:27.832
- Really?
- Sure.

1556
01:10:27.962 --> 01:10:29.094
I can't think of a better way
to celebrate

1557
01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:30.574
this beautiful day
than to spend it

1558
01:10:30.704 --> 01:10:32.010
with my awesome granddaughter.

1559
01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.143
Great. OK.

1560
01:10:35.274 --> 01:10:36.623
Thank you. Thank you.

1561
01:10:36.754 --> 01:10:39.713
Oh. Michelle. I can't
tell you how I know this.

1562
01:10:39.844 --> 01:10:42.281
but your patient. the one
you're about to operate on.

1563
01:10:42.412 --> 01:10:44.240
has a brain bleed
that no one has noticed.

1564
01:10:46.154 --> 01:10:46.938
What are you talking about?

1565
01:10:47.068 --> 01:10:49.245
Just trust me.

1566
01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:50.768
Go.

1567
01:10:50.898 --> 01:10:52.117
OK.

1568
01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.510
I'll see you later. honey.
Thank you.

1569
01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.642
OK. Bye. honey.

1570
01:10:58.558 --> 01:11:00.778
OK. now. how would you
like to help me

1571
01:11:00.908 --> 01:11:01.996
with a very special project?

1572
01:11:02.127 --> 01:11:04.129
You bet I can.

1573
01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.000
And that is gonna work
just like that.

1574
01:11:06.131 --> 01:11:08.829
We'll put
these screws in gently.

1575
01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.396
And that will fit
right in there like so.

1576
01:11:10.527 --> 01:11:12.137
- Right here.
- There you go.

1577
01:11:13.921 --> 01:11:15.009
Now put a little pressure
on it.

1578
01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:17.621
Nice job.

1579
01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:19.623
OK. I've got
this really quick meeting.

1580
01:11:19.753 --> 01:11:21.059
but you--you sit here
for a bit.

1581
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:23.627
If you need anything at all.
just come and get me.

1582
01:11:23.757 --> 01:11:25.672
You're the best Papa ever.

1583
01:11:29.894 --> 01:11:31.809
I want to thank you for coming
on such short notice.

1584
01:11:31.939 --> 01:11:33.376
I know this seems
out of the blue.

1585
01:11:33.506 --> 01:11:36.422
but I've realized recently
that time is precious.

1586
01:11:36.553 --> 01:11:39.251
and I didn't want to wait.

1587
01:11:39.382 --> 01:11:43.647
Well. I have to admit
I was gonna contact you anyway.

1588
01:11:43.777 --> 01:11:46.432
I have been following
your business for a long time.

1589
01:11:46.563 --> 01:11:50.610
I--I didn't actually ask you
here to talk about business.

1590
01:11:50.741 --> 01:11:53.352
Wait. I thought you were
gonna ask me to invest.

1591
01:11:53.483 --> 01:11:54.832
I am.

1592
01:11:54.962 --> 01:11:58.879
But first. I want to talk
a bit about life.

1593
01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:02.361
I know what it's like
to want to be successful.

1594
01:12:02.492 --> 01:12:05.059
to want to build something
that lasts.

1595
01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:07.279
But our work.
no matter how important it is.

1596
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:11.631
must always be in support
of the life we live

1597
01:12:11.762 --> 01:12:14.765
and never in sacrifice to it.

1598
01:12:14.895 --> 01:12:16.723
I do want you to invest
in PC Electric.

1599
01:12:16.854 --> 01:12:21.685
but only if it's part
of a life you want to live

1600
01:12:21.815 --> 01:12:24.601
and not an excuse
to hide from it.

1601
01:12:24.731 --> 01:12:26.690
You're not the person
I thought you would be.

1602
01:12:29.649 --> 01:12:31.085
I'm not the person
I thought I was.

1603
01:12:33.566 --> 01:12:35.220
Life is beautiful. right?

1604
01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.222
You learn something new
every day.

1605
01:12:38.832 --> 01:12:40.356
Yeah.

1606
01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:54.718
You were right.

1607
01:12:54.848 --> 01:12:56.763
I ran some tests
and found the bleed.

1608
01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:58.939
And we fixed it.

1609
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:00.680
The surgery was a success.

1610
01:13:00.811 --> 01:13:02.595
Oh. that's wonderful. honey.

1611
01:13:10.255 --> 01:13:12.823
I wish you could see
all the things I see

1612
01:13:12.953 --> 01:13:15.042
when I look at you.

1613
01:13:15.173 --> 01:13:18.655
A brave. strong. smart.

1614
01:13:18.785 --> 01:13:22.572
kind. generous woman.

1615
01:13:22.702 --> 01:13:24.574
I'm sorry I wasn't around for
you when you were growing up.

1616
01:13:24.704 --> 01:13:26.837
at least not the way
I needed to be.

1617
01:13:26.967 --> 01:13:30.144
None of that was your fault.

1618
01:13:30.275 --> 01:13:32.843
You deserved better.

1619
01:13:32.973 --> 01:13:36.629
And I am sorry it took me
this long to figure it out.

1620
01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.110
It's OK.

1621
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.851
You're here now.

1622
01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:42.287
That's what matters.

1623
01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:47.466
I heard there was free
hot chocolate in the cafeteria.

1624
01:13:47.597 --> 01:13:49.250
Is that true?

1625
01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:51.427
And why have you been keeping
this from me my entire life?

1626
01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:54.212
Because I am a mean.
horrible parent.

1627
01:13:54.342 --> 01:13:55.474
just like my dad here.

1628
01:13:58.346 --> 01:13:59.696
Why don't we all go get a cup?

1629
01:13:59.826 --> 01:14:02.133
You know. I have
a couple of final touches

1630
01:14:02.263 --> 01:14:04.440
to put on the carnival
for tonight.

1631
01:14:04.570 --> 01:14:05.658
Is it OK if you two
meet me there?

1632
01:14:05.789 --> 01:14:08.052
- Of course.
- Do we have to go.

1633
01:14:08.182 --> 01:14:09.140
It's always so boring.

1634
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:11.447
What?

1635
01:14:11.577 --> 01:14:14.232
What are you expecting.
some sort of wild and crazy

1636
01:14:14.362 --> 01:14:15.538
Christmas extravaganza?

1637
01:14:15.668 --> 01:14:17.409
Yes.

1638
01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:20.368
Well. then.

1639
01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:24.155
I guess that's just what
we're gonna have to have.

1640
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:29.639
- He's so silly. huh?
- Yeah.

1641
01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.920
Ho. ho. ho!

1642
01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:52.270
You came.
I'm so happy you're here.

1643
01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.751
Merry Christmas.

1644
01:14:54.881 --> 01:14:57.144
Well. the new boss.

1645
01:14:57.275 --> 01:14:59.277
- Papa!
- Oh. honey!

1646
01:14:59.407 --> 01:15:00.713
This is the best party ever.

1647
01:15:00.844 --> 01:15:02.672
Oh. hi.

1648
01:15:02.802 --> 01:15:04.021
It's just getting started.

1649
01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:06.763
I thought I would never
see the day.

1650
01:15:06.893 --> 01:15:11.245
Well. when you realize that
today is the only day you have.

1651
01:15:11.376 --> 01:15:12.508
you have to make sure

1652
01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:14.074
it's the best possible day
it can be.

1653
01:15:14.205 --> 01:15:15.815
OK. now I really don't know
what to think.

1654
01:15:15.946 --> 01:15:17.034
What has gotten into you?

1655
01:15:17.164 --> 01:15:18.601
Love!

1656
01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:20.472
And maybe a little bit
of that spiked eggnog.

1657
01:15:20.603 --> 01:15:22.300
You should try it.

1658
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:23.562
Honey. I think it's time

1659
01:15:23.693 --> 01:15:25.085
you finally showed me
that cartwheel.

1660
01:15:25.216 --> 01:15:27.392
OK.

1661
01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:30.221
- Ta-da!
- Yeah! All right. well done!

1662
01:15:30.351 --> 01:15:31.614
Let's get this party going.
Come on!

1663
01:15:31.744 --> 01:15:32.919
Give me a ho. ho. ho!

1664
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:34.225
all: Ho. ho. ho!

1665
01:15:34.355 --> 01:15:36.053
Oh. hive me that Ho!
Give me that Ho!

1666
01:15:36.183 --> 01:15:38.316
Ho. ho. ho!

1667
01:15:38.446 --> 01:15:40.579
Santa needs a cocktail.

1668
01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:43.234
Can I get a big can
of whipped cream?

1669
01:15:43.364 --> 01:15:44.496
Hi.
- Hi.

1670
01:15:44.627 --> 01:15:47.107
Hey. listen.

1671
01:15:47.238 --> 01:15:50.110
I have been thinking
about what you said.

1672
01:15:50.241 --> 01:15:53.026
about what I want from life.

1673
01:15:53.157 --> 01:15:54.680
I was gonna buy your company.

1674
01:15:54.811 --> 01:15:56.900
then break it into pieces
and sell off the parts.

1675
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:59.642
but I don't think
I want that anymore.

1676
01:15:59.772 --> 01:16:01.557
What do you want?

1677
01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:03.950
I want to build a life
worth living.

1678
01:16:04.081 --> 01:16:07.432
And I think PC Electric would
be a good place to start.

1679
01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.739
I agree.

1680
01:16:09.869 --> 01:16:14.700
And when I'm gone--
when I'm retired.

1681
01:16:14.831 --> 01:16:17.268
I know that you'll be there
to look after the company.

1682
01:16:17.398 --> 01:16:18.530
Thank you.

1683
01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:23.274
Oh.

1684
01:16:23.404 --> 01:16:25.058
Of course.

1685
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:26.103
Thank you.
- Cheers.

1686
01:16:26.233 --> 01:16:27.452
Cheers.

1687
01:16:31.238 --> 01:16:32.239
It's good.
- It's good.

1688
01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:33.327
- It's pretty good.
- Yeah.

1689
01:16:33.458 --> 01:16:36.200
Merry Christmas. Brian.

1690
01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:37.854
Merry Christmas. Sara.

1691
01:16:37.984 --> 01:16:39.116
Wow!

1692
01:16:39.246 --> 01:16:41.553
This is quite the party
you've thrown.

1693
01:16:41.684 --> 01:16:43.860
I thought you hated Christmas.

1694
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:45.339
A man can change.

1695
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:47.603
How about you?

1696
01:16:47.733 --> 01:16:49.866
Are you still
that open-hearted girl

1697
01:16:49.996 --> 01:16:52.346
I so foolishly walked out on
all those years ago?

1698
01:16:52.477 --> 01:16:55.219
Why don't you dance with me
and find out?

1699
01:17:03.401 --> 01:17:06.186
Mm.

1700
01:17:06.317 --> 01:17:07.753
Do you remember
that Christmas I spent

1701
01:17:07.884 --> 01:17:10.321
with you and your father?

1702
01:17:10.451 --> 01:17:11.539
He and I got
into a big fight.

1703
01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:12.845
and I stormed out.

1704
01:17:12.976 --> 01:17:14.020
Mm-hmm.

1705
01:17:14.151 --> 01:17:15.979
Well.

1706
01:17:16.109 --> 01:17:20.157
after you left.
we had a long talk.

1707
01:17:20.287 --> 01:17:23.551
He told me that he knew
how he was too hard on you.

1708
01:17:23.682 --> 01:17:27.164
that he always just wanted
what was best for you.

1709
01:17:27.294 --> 01:17:29.601
He told me how proud of you
he was.

1710
01:17:29.732 --> 01:17:31.559
how much he loved you.

1711
01:17:33.518 --> 01:17:36.869
He loved you.

1712
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.568
I loved you.

1713
01:17:40.699 --> 01:17:43.223
You didn't love yourself.

1714
01:17:43.354 --> 01:17:44.834
I knew it.

1715
01:17:44.964 --> 01:17:47.445
I knew you always loved me.
you just never told me.

1716
01:17:47.575 --> 01:17:51.014
You're horrible.

1717
01:17:51.144 --> 01:17:52.929
I know.

1718
01:17:53.059 --> 01:17:54.800
Oh.

1719
01:17:54.931 --> 01:17:57.760
Good evening. everyone.

1720
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:59.631
Thanks again for coming.

1721
01:17:59.762 --> 01:18:02.460
Just a few short words before...

1722
01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:05.202
it's all over.

1723
01:18:05.332 --> 01:18:07.117
PC Electric is
a family business.

1724
01:18:07.247 --> 01:18:10.468
And honestly. I'd--

1725
01:18:10.598 --> 01:18:13.210
I'd forgotten about the family
part for quite some time.

1726
01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:14.428
You see. I was so busy
trying to live up

1727
01:18:14.559 --> 01:18:17.040
to my father's memory

1728
01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:19.433
that I'd forgotten
what really matters

1729
01:18:19.564 --> 01:18:21.827
is making new ones.

1730
01:18:21.958 --> 01:18:24.351
I see it now.

1731
01:18:24.482 --> 01:18:26.919
the true meaning of Christmas.

1732
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:29.226
Love.

1733
01:18:29.356 --> 01:18:33.056
Love of family.
love of friendship.

1734
01:18:33.186 --> 01:18:36.537
love of humanity.

1735
01:18:36.668 --> 01:18:40.672
After all. Christmas celebrates
the birth of a love so great

1736
01:18:40.803 --> 01:18:43.240
that it just might
save the world.

1737
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:47.461
Gosh. I--I never got that.

1738
01:18:47.592 --> 01:18:50.813
You see. in my life.

1739
01:18:50.943 --> 01:18:54.077
there was always one person
I could never love:

1740
01:18:54.207 --> 01:18:55.252
myself.

1741
01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:00.170
I didn't think
I was worthy of love.

1742
01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:03.303
But if I can't love myself.
then the love I give

1743
01:19:03.434 --> 01:19:05.958
is worthless.

1744
01:19:06.089 --> 01:19:08.395
Not anymore.

1745
01:19:08.526 --> 01:19:12.486
So here's my Christmas wish.

1746
01:19:12.617 --> 01:19:17.665
I wish that all of you
could love yourselves

1747
01:19:17.796 --> 01:19:21.626
as much as I love you.

1748
01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:25.369
This has been
the best day of my life.

1749
01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:27.545
Merry Christmas!

1750
01:19:27.675 --> 01:19:29.112
Merry Christmas!

1751
01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:37.642
Why you gotta go
and make me cry like that?

1752
01:19:39.687 --> 01:19:44.127
Wow. you are just full
of surprises today.

1753
01:19:44.257 --> 01:19:46.085
Oh. I've got a few more
for you too.

1754
01:19:46.216 --> 01:19:47.173
You ready?
- Yeah.

1755
01:19:47.304 --> 01:19:48.479
Let's go.

1756
01:19:48.609 --> 01:19:49.567
All right.
keep your eyes closed.

1757
01:19:49.697 --> 01:19:50.960
- OK.
- Eyes closed.

1758
01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:52.396
- Where are we going?
- Eyes closed.

1759
01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:53.658
- Where are we?
- Closed. Closed. Closed.

1760
01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:55.486
- Come on.
- Keep them closed.

1761
01:19:55.616 --> 01:19:57.749
I'll say when.

1762
01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.011
All right. now...
- Uh-huh.

1763
01:19:59.142 --> 01:20:01.231
Open them.

1764
01:20:01.361 --> 01:20:02.710
I had a little help
from a friend.

1765
01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:07.715
- Dad.
- Too much?

1766
01:20:07.846 --> 01:20:10.414
Never.

1767
01:20:10.544 --> 01:20:12.459
All right. come on.
Get on in there. Let's go.

1768
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:13.721
What did you do
to the inside?

1769
01:20:13.852 --> 01:20:14.766
Is it--did you also
put Christmas in there?

1770
01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:15.593
Oh. wait till you see that.

1771
01:20:20.511 --> 01:20:21.468
Here you go.

1772
01:20:21.599 --> 01:20:24.776
Oh. boy. look at these.

1773
01:20:24.907 --> 01:20:27.257
- Here are the cookies.
- My goodness.

1774
01:20:27.387 --> 01:20:29.737
Whoa. whoa. hey.
those are for Santa.

1775
01:20:29.868 --> 01:20:31.478
Yeah.

1776
01:20:31.609 --> 01:20:33.654
Santa and I go way back.

1777
01:20:33.785 --> 01:20:36.222
He's not gonna mind.

1778
01:20:36.353 --> 01:20:39.660
Now. I want you two
to open these gifts.

1779
01:20:39.791 --> 01:20:42.359
No. It's Christmas Eve.
We always wait until morning.

1780
01:20:42.489 --> 01:20:43.360
New tradition.

1781
01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:45.231
I like this new tradition.

1782
01:20:45.362 --> 01:20:48.844
That is my dad's tool belt.

1783
01:20:48.974 --> 01:20:50.367
That way you'll know
you'll always have the tools

1784
01:20:50.497 --> 01:20:51.977
to fix anything in life.

1785
01:20:52.108 --> 01:20:53.109
Thank you. Papa.

1786
01:20:53.239 --> 01:20:54.414
You're welcome.

1787
01:20:54.545 --> 01:20:55.415
Your turn.

1788
01:20:55.546 --> 01:20:57.765
OK. OK.

1789
01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.859
You remember that music box
I gave you when you were 12?

1790
01:21:03.989 --> 01:21:05.817
Yeah. the one I broke?

1791
01:21:05.948 --> 01:21:07.950
The one I wouldn't fix.

1792
01:21:09.995 --> 01:21:11.083
I wish I could go back in time

1793
01:21:11.214 --> 01:21:13.607
and fix it
like you asked me to.

1794
01:21:13.738 --> 01:21:15.044
I wish I could go
back in time and fix

1795
01:21:15.174 --> 01:21:17.785
a lot of things in my life.

1796
01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:21.441
But I can't.
so I made you a new one.

1797
01:21:21.572 --> 01:21:24.053
- I helped.
- Yes. she did.

1798
01:21:24.183 --> 01:21:26.577
I hope that you'll fill
this one

1799
01:21:26.707 --> 01:21:29.275
with lots of good memories.

1800
01:21:31.538 --> 01:21:34.672
Open it.

1801
01:21:40.199 --> 01:21:43.681
Our song.

1802
01:21:43.811 --> 01:21:47.990
No matter what happens.
I love you.

1803
01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.426
I love you too.

1804
01:21:51.254 --> 01:21:53.082
Me too.

1805
01:21:53.212 --> 01:21:56.868
Oh. come here.

1806
01:21:56.999 --> 01:21:58.217
Merry Christmas.
- Oh.

1807
01:21:58.348 --> 01:22:01.220
Merry Christmas.

1808
01:22:01.351 --> 01:22:03.744
Now. you had better get
to sleep

1809
01:22:03.875 --> 01:22:05.224
or Santa won't come.

1810
01:22:05.355 --> 01:22:08.227
OK.

1811
01:22:08.358 --> 01:22:12.231
Thanks. Dad. for everything.

1812
01:22:12.362 --> 01:22:14.668
Good night. honey.

1813
01:22:14.799 --> 01:22:16.105
See you in the morning.

1814
01:22:22.198 --> 01:22:23.416
Merry Christmas.

1815
01:22:58.799 --> 01:23:03.413
And to all...

1816
01:23:03.543 --> 01:23:05.371
a good night.

1817
01:23:25.739 --> 01:23:28.699
You figured it out.

1818
01:23:28.829 --> 01:23:31.702
I did.

1819
01:23:31.832 --> 01:23:33.617
Took me a while.

1820
01:23:33.747 --> 01:23:36.228
Oh. it sure did.

1821
01:23:36.359 --> 01:23:39.144
Oh. I was running out
of ways to kill you.

1822
01:23:42.104 --> 01:23:44.802
There may not be
such a thing as a good death.

1823
01:23:44.932 --> 01:23:48.588
but at least now I can say
I lived a good life.

1824
01:23:51.635 --> 01:23:53.767
You ready to go?

1825
01:23:53.898 --> 01:23:55.291
I am.

1826
01:23:59.208 --> 01:24:01.384
Santa?

1827
01:24:01.514 --> 01:24:03.255
Yes?

1828
01:24:03.386 --> 01:24:04.430
Thanks.

1829
01:24:22.796 --> 01:24:24.320
I'm alive.

1830
01:24:30.456 --> 01:24:33.546
I'm alive.

1831
01:24:33.677 --> 01:24:35.331
It's Christmas Day.

1832
01:24:38.986 --> 01:24:42.033
Oh. my--

1833
01:24:42.164 --> 01:24:43.295
It's Christmas Day!

1834
01:24:43.426 --> 01:24:45.341
Ah! I'm alive!

1835
01:24:45.471 --> 01:24:47.430
Michelle! Harkin!

1836
01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.171
It's Christmas morning!
Wake up!

1837
01:24:49.301 --> 01:24:50.433
- Oh. my goodness.
- Let's open presents!

1838
01:24:50.563 --> 01:24:51.390
Come on!

1839
01:24:58.223 --> 01:24:59.703
You know. I don't know
what's gotten into you.

1840
01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:02.488
but I'm loving
this new version of you.

1841
01:25:02.619 --> 01:25:04.490
Me too.

1842
01:25:04.621 --> 01:25:08.015
both: ♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra

1843
01:25:08.146 --> 01:25:11.541
♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-li

1844
01:25:11.671 --> 01:25:14.413
♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra

1845
01:25:14.544 --> 01:25:15.675
Big finish.

1846
01:25:15.806 --> 01:25:21.072
all:
♪ That's an Irish lullaby

1847
01:25:22.856 --> 01:25:24.684
That's terrible.

1848
01:25:24.815 --> 01:25:27.122
This is the best
Christmas ever.

1849
01:25:27.252 --> 01:25:30.125
It is. indeed.

1850
01:25:30.255 --> 01:25:32.475
- Yeah.
- Say. why don't we have

1851
01:25:32.605 --> 01:25:34.390
a nice cup of hot cocoa?

1852
01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.174
Oh.

1853
01:25:36.305 --> 01:25:37.915
Maybe put
a little Irish whiskey in it.

1854
01:25:38.045 --> 01:25:39.656
Oh. yes. incredible. Yes.

1855
01:25:39.786 --> 01:25:41.658
- Aye.
- Oh. yes. aye.

1856
01:25:41.788 --> 01:25:43.921
Wait.

1857
01:25:44.051 --> 01:25:46.576
there's one more present.

1858
01:25:46.706 --> 01:25:48.273
I'll get that.

1859
01:25:48.404 --> 01:25:50.971
That's interesting.

1860
01:25:51.102 --> 01:25:54.366
To Brian. from Santa.

1861
01:25:54.497 --> 01:25:55.454
OK.

1862
01:25:55.585 --> 01:25:57.630
Well. huh.

1863
01:25:57.761 --> 01:26:01.895
Uh-huh.

1864
01:26:02.026 --> 01:26:04.246
Told you I knew him.

1865
01:26:06.596 --> 01:26:10.339
What is it. Papa?

1866
01:26:10.469 --> 01:26:13.255
It's a gift
from an old friend.

1867
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:25.223
Read the card.

1868
01:26:25.354 --> 01:26:26.746
Yeah.
