225
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.800
PAIN THAT HAS MADE YOU

WITH

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.559
MY RELATIONSHIP THEN UM I HAVE TO

241
00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:09.760
CHOOSE A PRIORITY SO I CHOSE THIS

242
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.679

THE SACRIFICE OF A SOUL WORTH

246
00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:26.240
THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER

247
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.079
SACRIFICED

248
00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:34.240

SACRIFICES MAKE YOU WHO YOU ARE ALL

251
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:43.520

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.160
GIVING UP ALL THE

253
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.200

FELT WORTHLESS

381
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.600
SO THAT'S WHY I MADE THIS LITTLE WOOD

382
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.919

383
00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:07.679

395
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.159

396
00:24:40.159 --> 00:24:43.760

397
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.799

00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:41.119
LITTLE BOW I LIKE TO SEE

695
00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:44.800
PEOPLE'S CHOICES WHEN I LOOK INTO

696
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.040
SOMEONE'S SOUL I CAN SEE EVERY CHOICE

697
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.640
THEY EVER MADE

698
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.480
EVERY MOTIVATION

699
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.520
THAT'S REALLY COOL UNTIL THEY HAD

700
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.599
NO MORE CHOICE BECAUSE OF HER

701
00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:04.320
RIGHT LOOKING INTO SOMEONE'S SOUL

702
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.599
IS MORE THAN JUST LIKE GETTING TO KNOW

703
00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:11.680
SOMEONE BECAUSE

704
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.760
YOU SEE THE THINGS THAT THEY DON'T WANT

705
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.359
YOU TO SEE

706
00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:16.960
WHEN I LOOK INTO THE SOULS I'VE

707
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.560
COLLECTED I SEE THINGS

708
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.720
THAT ONLY THEY HAVE KNOWN AND

709
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:29.359
IT EXCITES ME SO IS IT JUST SOME SORT OF

710
00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:31.040
PERSONAL SATISFACTION THAT YOU GET OUT

711
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.680
OF THIS WHOLE THING

712
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:40.839
MAYBE BUT I'VE GOT A LOT OF TIME

713
00:39:40.839 --> 00:40:02.560
UM

714
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:22.240
WHAT MATTERS MOST TO YOU

715
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:28.240
WHAT MATTERS MOST TO ME

716
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.160
IS A SENSE OF

717
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.839
REGAINING MY MISSING SENSE OF PURPOSE

718
00:40:36.839 --> 00:40:39.920
BUT I DON'T KNOW I FEEL LIKE I'VE

719
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:51.200
LOST THAT PURPOSE SOME TIME AGO

720
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:56.720
SO TALKING ABOUT PURPOSE

721
00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.720
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR PURPOSE IS

722
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.599
WE'VE ALL GOT ONE I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT

723
00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:06.000
MINE IS

724
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.079
YOU KNOW WHAT HIS IS

725
00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:14.079
WHAT'S YOURS

726
00:41:14.079 --> 00:41:15.839
I THOUGHT MY PURPOSE WAS TO BE THE BEST

727
00:41:15.839 --> 00:41:19.440
ACTOR IN LONDON

728
00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:23.760
BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT WORKED

729
00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.640
AH I WISH I STUDIED BETTER AT SCHOOL

730
00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.560
REALLY SOMETIMES I THINK I SHOULD HAVE

731
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.160
TAKEN A JOB FROM MY DAD

732
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.319
I HAD A PROPER CONTRACT I HAD YOU KNOW A

733
00:41:38.319 --> 00:41:40.319
PROMISE OF

734
00:41:40.319 --> 00:41:44.240
REASONABLE SUCCESS

735
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.640
BUT UH WHAT I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE

736
00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.640
MORE EXCITING

737
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.200
CONTRACT THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR

738
00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.000
WHAT WAS YOUR ANSWER EARLIER YOU DIDN'T

739
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.480

740
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.920
WORK UNDER YOUR DAD YOU DIDN'T WANT TO

741
00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.200

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.079
BECAUSE MY MUM WAS ENTERTAINING SOME

916
00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:31.200

MY MUM HAVING VARIOUS MEN GO UPSTAIRS I

921
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.040

BEDROOM INSPECTORS WHATEVER THAT IS

923
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.720

925
00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.760
CORPORATE PUNISHMENT SO

926
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.040
MY TEACHER GAVE ME A SLAP AROUND THE

927
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.040

929
00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.079
THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY TO STOP

930
00:50:58.079 --> 00:51:00.079
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT

931
00:51:00.079 --> 00:51:04.240

ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS

940
00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.280
BECAUSE EVEN AS CHILDREN

942
00:51:37.839 --> 00:51:39.440

BIG HOUSES OR SMALL HOUSES OR

1472
01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.280
HOW CAN YOU EXPECT US TO ALL JUST LIVE

1473
01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.280
TOGETHER WE CAN'T THAT'S WHY PEOPLE DIE

1474
01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.080
ON THE STREET

1475
01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:03.199
THAT'S WHY CROSS-CULTURALLY PEOPLE RACE

1476
01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:05.120
COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY CAN HAVE THE SAME

1477
01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.960
MORALS

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.120
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT HOW CAN PEOPLE

1479
01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.800

THEY DON'T SEEM TO THAT'S THE ANSWER

1482
01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.800

BUT IT'S FINE YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE THE

1484
01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.920
SAME MORALS

1485
01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.199

01:15:23.199 --> 01:15:24.000

THINK THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN UNITY TO

THINK ABOUT THAT THE PURPOSE

1541
01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.920
THE PURPOSE OF HUMANKIND IS TO DO WHAT

1542
01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:59.120
EVERY OTHER SPECIES IS SUPPOSED TO DO

1543
01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.159
MULTIPLY AND DESTROY IT

1544
01:18:02.159 --> 01:18:05.199

1554
01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.400

YES THEY HAVE DONE MORE HUMANS HAVE DONE

1561
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.880
CHARITY HUMANS HAVE SET UP

1562
01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.560

IMAGINE WHAT HUMANS CAN ACCOMPLISH WHAT

1565

DOWN THE ROAD THINGS ARE GREAT YES

MAKES THEM PURE

1572
01:19:13.679 --> 01:19:16.640
YES BUT BECAUSE HUMANS HAVE THIS CHOICE

1573
01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.640
HUMANS HAVE THIS SPECIAL THING ABOUT

1574
01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.840
THEM

1575
01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.880
