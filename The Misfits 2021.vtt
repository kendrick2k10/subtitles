3
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.516
RINGO: In a five-year period.
19.000 bank robberies
were reported to the FBI.

4
00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:27.391
So. that means there were
19.000 bank robbers

5
00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:29.132
who didn'’t do
their job correctly.

6
00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:32.092
Who wants the FBI on their ass?

7
00:01:34.137 --> 00:01:38.924
Nah. man. I say. if you gonna
rob a bank. make sure
it ain'’t reported.

8
00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:45.583
Funny thing about
safe deposit boxes...

9
00:01:47.368 --> 00:01:49.500
ain'’t nothing safe about them.

10
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:08.040
RINGO: None of the shit
in the boxes is insured.

11
00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:10.739
Try reporting a loss to
the bank or the government.

12
00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:13.611
you'’ll get the middle finger
in fine print.

13
00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.269
So who would use
a safe deposit box?

14
00:02:20.183 --> 00:02:21.141
Stupid people.

15
00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:24.056
And criminals.

16
00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:27.103
Now. I ain'’t got no problem
with stupid people.

17
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:29.888
as long as their stupidity
don'’t hurt nobody.

18
00:02:31.803 --> 00:02:35.111
The owner of box 2504
is a deadbeat dad

19
00:02:35.198 --> 00:02:38.114
who hides his income
so he doesn'’t have to pay
child support.

20
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.248
How you gonna do that
to your own kid?

21
00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:46.166
Let me be clear.
I never steal from people
who don'’t deserve it.

22
00:02:47.384 --> 00:02:51.475
And what I steal.
always goes back to those
who'’ve been harmed.

23
00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:56.959
That handsome black man?
Yeah. that'’s me. Ringo.

24
00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.092
Yeah. Ringo. like the Beatle.

25
00:03:00.702 --> 00:03:03.052
And don'’t start with that
John. Paul. George shit.

26
00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.185
'’cause I ain't got time
to get into it.

27
00:03:05.402 --> 00:03:08.405
What you need to pay attention
to is my masterful disguise.

28
00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.060
I'’m a black chameleon. baby.

29
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.109
And I'’m empty-handed.

30
00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:21.070
RINGO: '’Cause when those
a-holes discover
their boxes are empty.

31
00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:22.724
they'’ll get pissed.

32
00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:30.035
RINGO: They'’ll yell
at the bank manager.

33
00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:32.951
the bank manager
might even let him see
the security footage.

34
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.784
but he will also explain
what I already told you--
That shit ain'’t insured.

35
00:03:40.872 --> 00:03:44.528
One thing they will not do
is report it to the FBI.

36
00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.139
'’cause roaches hide
from the light.

37
00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:58.238
RINGO: And in about six months.
I'’ll empty my safe deposit
box and close my account.

38
00:04:02.024 --> 00:04:05.897
And I will write
a few wrongs. anonymously.

39
00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.424
Oh my God. David.
pack your things!

40
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:14.776
RINGO: Turns out I'’m not
the only one who feels
good about doing good.

41
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.735
That little dude.
his name is Wick.

42
00:04:20.564 --> 00:04:22.784
As a kid he heard
some Chinese story

43
00:04:22.914 --> 00:04:25.221
about firecrackers scaring
away evil spirits.

44
00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:30.531
There'’s two things you need
to know about Wick.

45
00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:32.446
First off...

46
00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:35.449
He don'’t give up.

47
00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:40.889
And eventually he got really
good at blowing shit up.

48
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.590
RINGO: Dude made a mint in Vegas
when they decided to remodel
the whole city.

49
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.160
Second. he'’s still the same
kid I first told you about.

50
00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:56.992
He'’s still goofy as hell.
still has the same haircut.
still looks like he'’s 12--

51
00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:01.213
and he still believes
firecrackers can chase away
evil spirits.

52
00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:03.738
This was a drug
manufacturing plant.

53
00:05:04.086 --> 00:05:07.394
Wick made sure no drugs
would ever come out
of here again.

54
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:09.309
Now I wasn'’t there.

55
00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:11.702
but I think it went a little
something like this.

56
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.428
RINGO: That there is Violet.

57
00:05:42.907 --> 00:05:46.650
Right now she in a church
in some shitty
Eastern Euro country.

58
00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:52.700
She just recently freed
a bunch of young girls
from a sex trafficking ring.

59
00:05:55.311 --> 00:05:58.009
And those are some
shitty Eastern Euro thugs

60
00:05:58.096 --> 00:06:03.188
who are about to join a long
list of men who underestimated
Violet'’s girl power.

61
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.996
RINGO: Yo. it was like some
Matrix-style shit.

62
00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:31.782
Now I ain'’t saying she
defied gravity or anything.

63
00:06:33.567 --> 00:06:35.133
'’cause I wasn't there.

64
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:39.137
But I do know only
one person walked
out of there that day.

65
00:06:44.316 --> 00:06:46.884
RINGO: About a year ago.
we didn'’t know each other.

66
00:06:47.232 --> 00:06:51.846
That all changed with a bouquet
of flowers. Three bouquets.

67
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:56.720
Seemed our good deeds
landed on the radar
of some philanthropist.

68
00:06:57.591 --> 00:06:59.854
It was an offer
to step up our game.

69
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.033
Why take down a street hustler
when you can go after
international corruption.

70
00:07:05.381 --> 00:07:09.080
We became a team. We tried
to come up with a cool name.

71
00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:10.734
The Robin Hoods.

72
00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:15.173
Nah. I ain'’t going
for any name calling
us no damn hoods.

73
00:07:15.347 --> 00:07:19.482
Wick even suggested
the Motley Crew.
with a straight face.

74
00:07:19.656 --> 00:07:23.094
Hell nah. But I like
the Misfits.

75
00:07:24.182 --> 00:07:26.924
Not everyone agreed
on the name. but eff that.

76
00:07:27.142 --> 00:07:30.537
I'’m telling the story.
So the Misfits it is.

77
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.633
Anyway. the next chapter
in our story started
a little while ago

78
00:07:39.894 --> 00:07:41.504
in a prison in Los Angeles.

79
00:07:48.163 --> 00:07:52.254
WARDEN: The FBI is here
to extradite inmate 272523
to Mr. Schultz'’s prison.

80
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.256
WARDEN: Where?England.

81
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.737
Mr. Schultz runs
a privatized prison there.

82
00:07:56.824 --> 00:07:59.130
this particular inmate.
Richard Pace. broke out.

83
00:07:59.261 --> 00:08:02.003
And you came all this way
just for a prisoner escape?

84
00:08:02.873 --> 00:08:03.918
Wife issues.

85
00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:07.095
RINGO: Wife issues is Latin
for this prisoner

86
00:08:07.182 --> 00:08:09.010
was laying pipe
to Schultz'’s wife.

87
00:08:11.055 --> 00:08:14.363
And for Schultz...
that caused some issues.

88
00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:17.322
WARDEN: Wish prisons here would
send wardens on vacation.

89
00:08:17.453 --> 00:08:18.715
HASSAN:
Mr. Schultz isn'’t a warden.

90
00:08:19.194 --> 00:08:21.762
WARDEN: No.
he'’s a senior partner
in a multinational company

91
00:08:21.849 --> 00:08:25.113
which happens to own.
among other things.
prisons all over the planet.

92
00:08:26.244 --> 00:08:29.204
Coming up on the right here.
440. open 312.

93
00:08:29.378 --> 00:08:31.032
OFFICER 2: Copy 21. opening now.

94
00:08:31.206 --> 00:08:33.643
Name'’s Richard Pace...
you should know.

95
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:35.123
Come back 440?

96
00:08:35.689 --> 00:08:37.560
OFFICER 2: Well. we just got
paperwork for his
immediate release.

97
00:08:37.778 --> 00:08:39.606
The judge apparently
threw out the charges.

98
00:08:47.614 --> 00:08:48.919
SCHULTZ:
That'’s not Richard Pace.

99
00:08:51.487 --> 00:08:52.532
He is good. though.

100
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.929
This is Pace this morning
from the prison exercise yard.
Look at this.

101
00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:02.716
There. Right there.

102
00:09:03.891 --> 00:09:06.763
Look. I'’m just spitballing here.
but I think that was a drone.

103
00:09:07.155 --> 00:09:09.244
All right. if that'’s the drone.
what'’s the payload?

104
00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:12.421
Could have been key-cards.
it could'’ve been a birthday
cake with a hacksaw in it.

105
00:09:12.726 --> 00:09:15.337
All we know is that
we'’ve searched this
installation from top to bottom.

106
00:09:15.642 --> 00:09:17.121
Richard Pace isn'’t here.

107
00:09:17.295 --> 00:09:20.124
I don'’t get it. If he was going
to be released in 24 hours.

108
00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:21.343
why break out?

109
00:09:21.822 --> 00:09:24.564
Probably because
there was something
he needed to do today...

110
00:09:26.174 --> 00:09:27.218
not tomorrow.

111
00:09:30.744 --> 00:09:33.442
You are...

112
00:09:33.616 --> 00:09:34.748
Hanni.Hanni.

113
00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:36.445
Hanni Abu Assad.

114
00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:38.055
Right.

115
00:09:38.882 --> 00:09:39.840
So...

116
00:09:41.624 --> 00:09:42.669
where'’s Pace?

117
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:44.714
How would I know?

118
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.023
Well. you bunked with him
for three months.

119
00:09:49.937 --> 00:09:52.809
It seems that he did
that intentionally

120
00:09:52.896 --> 00:09:56.421
because you had something
to tell him. something...

121
00:09:57.379 --> 00:09:59.033
valuable to tell him.

122
00:10:03.951 --> 00:10:05.387
I don'’t know.

123
00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:08.346
Right.

124
00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:14.048
Well. maybe...

125
00:10:16.224 --> 00:10:22.404
you will feel better...
talking to me in... private.

126
00:10:32.762 --> 00:10:34.416
GUARD: Power went down.WARDEN: Damn it.

127
00:10:34.503 --> 00:10:36.897
Now we got a foreign national
alone in a room with a felon.

128
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:43.817
WARDEN: What'’s going on?

129
00:10:46.297 --> 00:10:47.342
SCHULTZ: Look at that.

130
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:50.998
I know where Pace is.

131
00:10:52.477 --> 00:10:53.478
Excuse me.

132
00:10:55.567 --> 00:10:57.047
RINGO: Hell yeah.
he know where Pace was.

133
00:10:57.395 --> 00:11:01.095
He just beat the info
out of poor Hanni
with a damn cell phone.

134
00:11:09.581 --> 00:11:12.236
RINGO: Turns out.
Hanni used to be the valet

135
00:11:12.323 --> 00:11:14.456
of Prince Hakeem Al Zahrani.

136
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:17.241
Pace learned the prince
like to do stupid shit

137
00:11:17.372 --> 00:11:19.591
like travel into Los Angeles
once a year

138
00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.158
for a single day of shopping.

139
00:11:29.558 --> 00:11:31.647
PRINCE: My usual.MAN: Next round on the house.

140
00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:35.303
RINGO: He also never traveled
without his high-value
collection of timepieces.

141
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.871
That'’s expensive-ass watches.

142
00:11:40.264 --> 00:11:43.441
Girard-Joseph Grand Ellava.

143
00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:49.578
Gold. platinum. 23 carats.
D color. flawless diamonds.

144
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:53.713
One of only two ever made.

145
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.068
Richard Pace.

146
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.767
Pleased to meet you.Nice to meet you. too.

147
00:12:07.378 --> 00:12:10.120
You'’re Kuwaiti. huh?

148
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:14.429
I have a daughter who works
in the Middle East. UNICEF.

149
00:12:15.473 --> 00:12:21.653
Charitable work. children.
refugees and...
something like that.

150
00:12:29.226 --> 00:12:31.228
...how much does a watch
like that go for?

151
00:12:31.489 --> 00:12:34.971
Four. five mill--
Oh. I'’m so sorry.

00:12:35.058 --> 00:12:36.668

It'’s fine.You got some right there.

155
00:12:42.109 --> 00:12:43.327
Oops. I do apologize.

156
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.026
If you don'’t mind.Yes. okay.

157
00:12:46.156 --> 00:12:48.593
My fault. I'’ve had
too much to drink

158
00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:53.076
it'’s just one of those days.
Okay. Time to go.

159
00:13:04.522 --> 00:13:05.523
GUARD: Hello.

160
00:13:06.046 --> 00:13:07.177
Hello.

161
00:13:08.526 --> 00:13:09.745
What you got there?

162
00:13:12.922 --> 00:13:14.228
GUARD: Prince Hakeem Al Zahrani?

163
00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:16.056
It'’s an old picture.

164
00:13:20.756 --> 00:13:22.236
Do you want to go
and talk about this?

165
00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:23.672
Hmm. no. not really.

166
00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.935
Yeah. he wants to go
and talk about it.

167
00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:27.241
Jesus.

168
00:13:45.607 --> 00:13:46.913
It'’s an honest living.

169
00:13:57.358 --> 00:13:58.620
Penthouse.AGENT: Hold up.

170
00:13:58.794 --> 00:14:00.448
You don'’t have any
jurisdiction or authority here.

171
00:14:00.578 --> 00:14:01.797
You let the FBI
handle this.

172
00:14:01.884 --> 00:14:03.320
GUARD: You heard him.
Knock yourself out.

173
00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:09.892
Here you go.

174
00:15:20.528 --> 00:15:22.095
MAN 1: Go to the bedroom.MAN 2: Copy that.

175
00:15:23.618 --> 00:15:25.054
I'’m going to go wash up.

176
00:15:26.882 --> 00:15:28.884
You go through the first door.
I'’ll go through the second.

177
00:15:33.541 --> 00:15:35.586
My watches are gone!

178
00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:39.634
How are we doing?

179
00:15:41.157 --> 00:15:42.158
We had some company.

180
00:15:43.029 --> 00:15:44.595
Almost there.

181
00:15:45.292 --> 00:15:46.380
How we doing?

182
00:15:46.902 --> 00:15:48.251
We are almost there. Yeah.

183
00:16:00.307 --> 00:16:01.351
GUARD 1: Hey!GUARD 2: Hey!

184
00:16:09.359 --> 00:16:12.841
Gentlemen. I had a lovely stay.Your car is waiting for you.

185
00:16:18.151 --> 00:16:19.935
Surprise!

186
00:16:22.894 --> 00:16:24.548
Ah. thank you.

187
00:16:27.638 --> 00:16:30.206
Nice to see you again.Good to see you too. uh.

188
00:16:30.337 --> 00:16:33.862
Prince Al Zahrani?No. I made that up.

189
00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:39.389
RINGO: This is the Prince.
Not Prince Al Zahrani.
He made that shit up.

190
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.566
He claims to be a prince
from some country
nobody'’s ever heard of.

191
00:16:43.132 --> 00:16:45.308
But that don'’t matter.
What matters is...

192
00:16:46.222 --> 00:16:49.312
remember the philanthropist
who sent the flowers?
This is that dude.

193
00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:52.098
Shall we?Let'’s roll. Like right now.

194
00:16:56.711 --> 00:16:59.061
All right. bring the cars
around. let'’s go. Let's go.

195
00:17:16.209 --> 00:17:17.384
Shit.

196
00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:24.304
Thank you. These are mine.

197
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:29.178
So this is a con?

198
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.921
RINGO: Con seems
pretty inadequate
to describe what we did.

199
00:17:33.008 --> 00:17:36.490
We even hired the dude
to play Hanni
as Pace'’s cellmate.

200
00:17:36.751 --> 00:17:39.623
Yeah. we probably gon'’
have to give that dude
some worker'’s comp.

201
00:17:39.754 --> 00:17:42.235
Color me minorly
impressed. but why?

202
00:17:43.279 --> 00:17:47.588
Simple. We need you.
you don'’t need us.
For that. we needed leverage.

203
00:17:56.771 --> 00:18:00.383
PRINCE: You know what they call
a serious crime captured
on multiple hotel cameras?

204
00:18:01.732 --> 00:18:06.215
Leverage. Now.
you need us. Simple.

205
00:18:19.968 --> 00:18:22.971
Who exactly is us?Me and my friends.

206
00:18:34.635 --> 00:18:35.897
You don'’t have to come with us.

207
00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:44.123
Up to you.

208
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.655
What are we waiting for?

209
00:19:12.107 --> 00:19:14.501
What the hell did Pace do to
Schultz'’s wife that was so bad?

210
00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:19.636
Let'’s just say Mrs. Schultz
isn'’t the one upset by it.

211
00:19:19.897 --> 00:19:21.943
Oh. Oh...

212
00:19:40.614 --> 00:19:44.183
Here'’s to my kidnapping. Whoo!

213
00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:47.882
Kidnapping requires a element
of force. no force here.

214
00:19:48.056 --> 00:19:49.579
You'’re free to go
whenever you want.

215
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.277
There'’s an exit sign
right behind you.

216
00:19:51.581 --> 00:19:53.801
Yeah. Well. maybe I'’ll
just pass on that one.

217
00:19:54.062 --> 00:19:55.455
My man.

218
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.761
The name'’s Ringo.

219
00:19:59.023 --> 00:20:01.548
That'’s Violet. That's my man
Wick over there.

220
00:20:02.026 --> 00:20:05.552
You already had a chance
to meet the con artist
formerly known as Prince.

221
00:20:06.335 --> 00:20:10.600
Is this some kind
of criminal organization?Nah. not criminal at all.

222
00:20:10.818 --> 00:20:12.428
Just a few people trying
to do what'’s right.

223
00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:18.826
Well. you got the wrong guy here
because right is not what I do.

224
00:20:18.956 --> 00:20:22.917
Oh. we know.
You got quite the reputation.

225
00:20:23.134 --> 00:20:24.571
Yeah. the only thing that
you better at

226
00:20:24.658 --> 00:20:26.660
than stealing
people'’s shit is getting caught.

227
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.359
And escaping.
You'’re a damn legend.

228
00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:32.840
How many of Schultz'’s
prisons did he escape?

229
00:20:33.014 --> 00:20:35.146
By my count. four. give or take.

230
00:20:35.451 --> 00:20:38.498
Four prisons?
Built by the same guy?

231
00:20:38.585 --> 00:20:42.850
I love it. man.
we all love it.
But you know who don'’t love it?

232
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.286
Schultz.RINGO: Mm-mm.

233
00:20:44.504 --> 00:20:45.896
He don'’t love it at all.

234
00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:48.856
And that don'’t have nothing
to do with the rumors
about you and his wife.

235
00:20:52.816 --> 00:20:55.515
Schultz didn'’t come to extradite
you back to his prison.

236
00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:58.561
Those papers were forged.
He was there to kill you.

237
00:20:58.866 --> 00:21:03.000
Judging by your contributions
to society thus far. I can'’t say
it was the wrong choice.

238
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:05.133
But we'’re giving you
a chance to turn things around.

239
00:21:05.525 --> 00:21:07.266
Oh great. lucky me.

240
00:21:07.396 --> 00:21:11.835
Look. all you have to know is
we got the same piece of shit
on our shoes.

241
00:21:12.096 --> 00:21:13.272
Werner Schultz.

242
00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.449
RINGO: Shit doesn'’t even
start to explain.

243
00:21:16.971 --> 00:21:18.581
He even owns prisons
in the Middle East.

244
00:21:19.016 --> 00:21:21.497
Schultz saw dollar signs
and wanted to expand.

245
00:21:21.889 --> 00:21:23.847
so he partnered
with the Muslim Brotherhood.

246
00:21:23.978 --> 00:21:27.634
The local terrorist organization
in some country
called Jazeristan.

247
00:21:28.025 --> 00:21:31.986
Well. you know Schultz
does build prisons
and pretty good ones.

248
00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:36.686
But terrorism? Well.
that'’s a bit of a stretch.

249
00:21:36.947 --> 00:21:39.080
Yeah. you'’d think
until Schultz realized

250
00:21:39.167 --> 00:21:41.300
that he had a bargaining chip
in one of his cells.

251
00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:44.738
Yeah. A hard-partying Arab
by the name of Jason Quick.

252
00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:47.784
RINGO: They got him
for everything.

253
00:21:47.871 --> 00:21:50.700
Drugs. possession.
weapon solicitation you name it.

254
00:21:52.485 --> 00:21:53.703
I am back. bitches!

255
00:21:54.051 --> 00:21:55.488
RINGO: Schultz just up
and let him go.

256
00:21:59.448 --> 00:22:03.800
Turns out that Jason Quick
is actually Jasim bin
something or something.

257
00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:06.107
One of the top dogs
of Muslim Brotherhood'’s son.

258
00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:09.589
And when Schultz released
him. it granted him
favor with this man.

259
00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:14.681
Abu Hirawa.
Real name is Am-jam...

260
00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:18.598
What he had to say.

261
00:22:18.902 --> 00:22:21.862
For all intents and purposes.
Bin Laden'’s successor.

262
00:22:24.386 --> 00:22:27.520
...Schultz
is in bed with this guy.

263
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:32.394
In bed. under the covers
with some KY Jelly doing
all kinds of freaky shit.

264
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.789
Why are you telling me?'Cause you'’re a thief.

265
00:22:36.093 --> 00:22:40.141
Let me stop you right there.
Yes. I'’m a thief...

266
00:22:41.272 --> 00:22:44.841
but I only steal from
upstanding citizens
who pay insurance.

267
00:22:45.146 --> 00:22:47.583
Nobody gets hurt.
Particularly me.

268
00:22:47.844 --> 00:22:51.065
Besides... I only work alone.

269
00:22:52.196 --> 00:22:57.114
And if that changes.
and it won'’t...
none of you will make the cut.

270
00:23:01.118 --> 00:23:03.991
There'’s millions of dollars
worth of gold in one
of those locations.

271
00:23:10.824 --> 00:23:11.912
I like gold.

272
00:23:13.827 --> 00:23:16.569
VIOLET: Terrorism generates
a lot of cash. kidnappings.

273
00:23:16.786 --> 00:23:19.659
drugs. oil. theft.
but it'’s all dirty.

274
00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:22.488
It'’s traceable. In order
to launder the money...

275
00:23:22.879 --> 00:23:25.447
Gold.RINGO: Oh yeah. Gold.

276
00:23:25.969 --> 00:23:28.929
Hidden in a place that no one
wants to dare step foot in.

277
00:23:29.277 --> 00:23:30.626
unless they'’re forced to.

278
00:23:38.852 --> 00:23:40.027
A prison?

279
00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:42.812
Oh. not just any old prison.
Your boy Schultz'’s prison.

280
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.511
We'’re goin' in.
You want to join us?

281
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.082
You want me to go
into a Middle Eastern country.

282
00:23:52.256 --> 00:23:55.869
one that you'’ve been explaining
for an ungodly amount of time.

283
00:23:55.999 --> 00:23:58.872
that is filled with terrorists.
to steal their gold.

284
00:23:59.394 --> 00:24:01.483
Yeah.That'’s exactly what
we want you to do.

285
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:05.008
In other words. something good.
for once.

286
00:24:13.277 --> 00:24:15.628
Oh. that'’s rich. That'’s rich.

287
00:24:16.237 --> 00:24:19.806
...how do I put this. I got it.

288
00:24:20.546 --> 00:24:21.634
Nope.

289
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.679
And if it makes
you feel any better.

290
00:24:24.506 --> 00:24:27.030
I'’m pretty sure every
one of you is insane.

291
00:24:27.378 --> 00:24:29.293
Especially this dude
sitting over here.

292
00:24:29.729 --> 00:24:33.341
Excuse me. We on descent.
Please fasten your seatbelts.
Thanks.

293
00:24:36.387 --> 00:24:38.781
You know. I guess I should
have asked this sooner.

294
00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:40.696
descent to where?

295
00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.525
To Abu Dhabi.

296
00:24:46.006 --> 00:24:47.094
Abu Dhabi.

297
00:24:50.445 --> 00:24:52.578
Hey man. Schultz'’s new besties.

298
00:24:53.274 --> 00:24:56.582
the dudes in the grey suits.
Muslim Brotherhood.

299
00:24:57.887 --> 00:24:59.498
They'’ll try to kill
you again. you know.

300
00:25:01.238 --> 00:25:03.893
You change your mind.
there'’s a card
in your left breast pocket.

301
00:25:04.894 --> 00:25:07.723
Call us.PACE: Arrivederci.

302
00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:17.820
My. my. would you look at this?

303
00:25:20.214 --> 00:25:21.302
Taxi?

304
00:25:26.786 --> 00:25:28.309
Whoa.

305
00:25:33.836 --> 00:25:35.751
Watch the tempo

306
00:25:36.056 --> 00:25:38.101
Watch the tempo

307
00:25:38.362 --> 00:25:40.669
Watch the tempo

308
00:25:40.843 --> 00:25:43.454
some mad love...

309
00:25:43.977 --> 00:25:48.721
Why don'’t you take me
to the best five star hotel
in... Abu Dhabi?

310
00:25:53.769 --> 00:25:57.033
DRIVER: First time here?Yeah. it is. Yeah. it is.

311
00:25:57.207 --> 00:25:58.513
PACE: You know what?DRIVER: What?

312
00:25:58.905 --> 00:26:01.255
I think I'’m gonna like it here.Yeah. you will.

00:26:04.127 --> 00:26:08.305

You going too hard

316
00:26:26.323 --> 00:26:28.325
The two apart

317
00:26:30.284 --> 00:26:33.766
Why you makin' it so hard?

318
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.727
You ready. break down my guard

319
00:26:40.511 --> 00:26:44.994
Love me like we ain't
Never let go

320
00:26:45.473 --> 00:26:48.607
Poco a poco. muy. muy lento...

321
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.787
Love me. give me some mad love

322
00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:15.808
Hey there.
Give us your best single
malt whiskey. Two ice cubes.

323
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.768
It'’s a good-looking watch.

324
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:26.427
Leon LaFleur Magnifique. 769
working parts.

325
00:27:26.775 --> 00:27:31.432
each one created by
a single craftsman at
an atelier in Switzerland.

326
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:35.784
I believe. only four of them
ever made in the world.

327
00:27:36.089 --> 00:27:37.568
Huh. Impressive.

328
00:27:40.746 --> 00:27:42.399
Wonder how this
wallet got down here?

329
00:27:43.009 --> 00:27:45.925
Sorry.
Huh. Your wallet.

330
00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:47.361
No. it'’s not.

331
00:27:48.275 --> 00:27:51.147
And I rather drink alone.
I actually insist on it.

332
00:27:53.019 --> 00:27:54.194
Okay. fair play.

333
00:27:56.283 --> 00:28:00.548
All right. Auf Wiedersehen.
Good luck to yourself.

334
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.991
PACE: Sorry.

335
00:28:15.868 --> 00:28:17.304
Hi. gin and tonic. please.

336
00:28:25.747 --> 00:28:26.966
I don'’t believe it.

337
00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:31.884
Oh. excuse me.
I think you dropped this.

338
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:35.888
Oh. thank you so much.
What a pleasure meeting you.

339
00:28:36.018 --> 00:28:37.280
Yes. you too.Where are you from?

340
00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:40.327
I'’m from the states.
Um. I travel--Ma'’am.

341
00:28:41.415 --> 00:28:43.373
I believe you
dropped your pocketbook.

342
00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:45.854
Thank you. You know what?
That is so funny.

343
00:28:45.941 --> 00:28:48.596
I literally just picked
that up in the gift shop.I bet you did.

344
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:53.122
But you know. you must be
more careful the world is rife
with thieves and cutpurses.

345
00:28:53.383 --> 00:28:56.082
Don'’t I know it.
Which is why I bought
the cheapest one I could...

346
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:59.650
and keep my real one...
close to me heart.

347
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.306
Is there anything else you
keep close to your heart?

348
00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:07.441
Let me see. um...
the trials of the poor.

349
00:29:07.571 --> 00:29:10.836
the downtrodden. tribulations
of the world'’s oppressed.

350
00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:13.926
Otherwise. no. not a thing.

351
00:29:14.317 --> 00:29:15.928
Sounds like a lonely existence.

352
00:29:16.363 --> 00:29:18.582
No. actually.
it'’s quite fulfilling
and lacks little.

353
00:29:19.888 --> 00:29:20.889
Sometimes...

354
00:29:22.499 --> 00:29:25.067
things are missing in our lives
and we don'’t even know it.

355
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.332
Things tend to stay missing
if you don'’t actually
look for them.

356
00:29:29.593 --> 00:29:33.075
If you don'’t mind. the lady
I were having a conversation.

357
00:29:33.249 --> 00:29:34.642
Really now. that'’s very funny

358
00:29:34.729 --> 00:29:36.818
because I thought you prefer
to drink alone.

359
00:29:37.079 --> 00:29:39.342
In fact. if I recall.
you insisted.

360
00:29:40.648 --> 00:29:44.739
Go. Find your own.
This one is mine.

361
00:29:44.957 --> 00:29:47.873
Huh! What did you say?She'’s my new friend.

362
00:29:49.831 --> 00:29:50.876
Really?

363
00:29:51.659 --> 00:29:55.445
That'’s very interesting
because actually...
she'’s my daughter.

364
00:29:56.664 --> 00:29:58.797
And I don'’t know you. friend.

365
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:08.197
The gentleman. he had
to run away there.

366
00:30:08.284 --> 00:30:11.548
but he said for his drinks.
our drinks on his room.
Thank you so much.

367
00:30:14.987 --> 00:30:16.902
That was a very
swift move back there.

368
00:30:17.685 --> 00:30:19.382
Yeah. Well. I had
quite the teacher.

369
00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:25.258
It'’s good to see you. Hope.
It really is.

370
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:26.912
You too. Dad.

371
00:30:29.001 --> 00:30:30.524
So. how'’d you end up
in Abu Dhabi?

372
00:30:31.133 --> 00:30:35.007
Same way I ended up in prison.
Against my will.

373
00:30:35.311 --> 00:30:36.573
And you?

374
00:30:37.313 --> 00:30:39.838
I'’m-- I'm here to meet
some philanthropist.

375
00:30:39.968 --> 00:30:43.276
We'’re talking through new.
innovative ways to help
the refugee crisis.

376
00:30:43.406 --> 00:30:45.060
That'’s good. Impressive.Yeah. it is.

377
00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:49.195
And when I was
in the hotel lobby.
I saw another crisis developing.

378
00:30:49.412 --> 00:30:52.328
Yeah.

379
00:30:54.896 --> 00:30:56.289
Hey. listen.

380
00:30:58.073 --> 00:31:01.903
Let'’s go for a walk. shall we?
It'’s been a while.Yeah. okay.

381
00:31:03.426 --> 00:31:05.602
Maybe on second thoughts...

382
00:31:06.212 --> 00:31:08.910
Very nice.Pay the bill here...

383
00:31:09.171 --> 00:31:11.739
Here you go.
Keep the change.

384
00:31:19.834 --> 00:31:21.227
Have you seen your mother?

385
00:31:22.619 --> 00:31:24.230
She'’s my mom. so. yeah.

386
00:31:25.057 --> 00:31:28.234
Yeah. she'’s fine.

387
00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:30.714
Re-married.Hmm.

388
00:31:31.585 --> 00:31:35.023
Took her a long time.
but she got over it.That'’s good.

389
00:31:35.415 --> 00:31:36.416
Yeah.

390
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:37.983
That'’s really good.

391
00:31:38.461 --> 00:31:41.725
How about you. how'’re you doing?
You... married yet?

392
00:31:42.378 --> 00:31:45.642
No. I'’m not married.
I. uh...

393
00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:47.644
I have trouble trusting men.

394
00:31:49.429 --> 00:31:50.604
Daddy issues.

395
00:31:53.824 --> 00:31:56.915
Look. Hope. I know this
sounds like a cliche.

396
00:31:57.132 --> 00:32:00.135
but I did it for you
and it was the right
thing to do at the time.

397
00:32:00.657 --> 00:32:02.355
Why? Because you'’re
just so wrong?

398
00:32:07.838 --> 00:32:08.883
PACE: It was.

399
00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:12.147
You know what the sad thing.
I mean the real tragedy
of this whole thing is?

400
00:32:13.148 --> 00:32:14.758
You actually believe that.

401
00:32:16.369 --> 00:32:18.501
But I know deep down.
under all that

402
00:32:18.675 --> 00:32:21.591
urbane panache
and capricious thievery.
you'’re good.

403
00:32:24.072 --> 00:32:25.682
Just gotta find that person.

404
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.124
Yeah. well that'’s
easier said than done.

405
00:32:44.745 --> 00:32:48.662
I have to go. I'’m sorry.
I have to go prepare
for this meeting.

406
00:32:48.749 --> 00:32:49.750
Okay.

407
00:32:51.926 --> 00:32:54.146
It'’s good to see you.Yeah. it'’s good
to see you too. Dad.

408
00:32:54.885 --> 00:32:56.365
Bye.Bye.

409
00:35:26.211 --> 00:35:28.213
Okay. I'’m in.

410
00:35:28.822 --> 00:35:32.173
But if I do this.
and this comes off.

411
00:35:32.869 --> 00:35:35.176
it'’s because of what
I bring to the table.

412
00:35:35.916 --> 00:35:38.875
I'’m in charge.
What I say goes. no exceptions.

413
00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:42.270
We can live with that.It'’s why we picked you.

414
00:35:42.401 --> 00:35:48.276
And the split? Tch.
Not even. not five ways.
50/50 boom. boom.

415
00:35:49.582 --> 00:35:52.802
Split of what?The money. The gold.

416
00:35:54.587 --> 00:35:57.372
There won'’t be any.What do you mean
there won'’t be any.

417
00:35:57.459 --> 00:36:00.158
I thought that was the point
of the story. Steal the gold.

418
00:36:00.462 --> 00:36:03.987
It is. But that doesn'’t mean
they'’ll be any gold to split.

419
00:36:04.162 --> 00:36:06.555
Well. why the hell not?Because it'’s not about us.

420
00:36:06.947 --> 00:36:09.167
It'’s about preventing that gold
from financing terrorism.

421
00:36:09.384 --> 00:36:13.693
Right. I get that. Steal
their gold. stop the terrorists.

422
00:36:14.259 --> 00:36:16.478
To the victor goes the spoils.

423
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:18.611
There are no victors. Pace.

424
00:36:19.002 --> 00:36:21.179
We'’re never going to be able
to stop the Muslim Brotherhood.

425
00:36:21.875 --> 00:36:24.269
but we can try and stop
one bomb from going off.

426
00:36:24.356 --> 00:36:27.359
We do what we do to help
others. never ourselves.

427
00:36:30.666 --> 00:36:33.060
PACE: Oh my God.
here we go again.

428
00:36:33.408 --> 00:36:38.065
If this weren'’t so amusing...
it would be sad.

429
00:36:38.892 --> 00:36:41.329
Ciao.

430
00:36:45.855 --> 00:36:46.856
RINGO: Pace.

431
00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:51.992
Pace. Pace!

432
00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.778
Look. I'’m not sure
how you got hold
of your information

433
00:36:56.475 --> 00:37:00.261
or who told you I might
even have any interest
in this act of compassion.

434
00:37:00.566 --> 00:37:03.133
but they were wrong.I did.

435
00:37:04.787 --> 00:37:06.267
I told them.

436
00:37:07.529 --> 00:37:11.577
I told you had a meeting
about the refugee crisis.
This is that meaning.

437
00:37:11.925 --> 00:37:13.143
Oh. for God'’s sake.

438
00:37:14.275 --> 00:37:17.844
Don'’t tell me they
brought you in. too.No. I pulled them.

439
00:37:19.062 --> 00:37:20.368
This is my idea.

440
00:37:20.673 --> 00:37:23.458
Hope. listen to me.
if any of this is true.

441
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.156
contact the embassy.
talk to a congressman.

442
00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:27.375
We tried.

443
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.725
VIOLET: Jazeristan is
an important US ally.

444
00:37:29.943 --> 00:37:33.338
U.S. Centcom uses Al Udeid
Air Base to launch assaults

445
00:37:33.425 --> 00:37:36.515
in the Middle East.
America doesn'’t need to
ask too many questions.

446
00:37:37.037 --> 00:37:39.387
and Jazeristan doesn'’t
need to find any answers.

447
00:37:42.216 --> 00:37:43.609
Do they know about this?

448
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:46.089
They know. but they
don'’t know. you know?

449
00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:53.749
Come on. darling.
what am I gonna do here?

450
00:37:54.794 --> 00:37:56.970
This. I want you to do this.

451
00:38:00.539 --> 00:38:03.368
Look. Dad.
we need you.

452
00:38:05.892 --> 00:38:06.980
I need you.

453
00:38:09.112 --> 00:38:12.507
Just this once. I'’m asking
you not to walk out the door.

454
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.516
I must need my head examined.

455
00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:25.520
Yeah. I feel like
I should mention something
about Abu Hirawa.

456
00:38:26.391 --> 00:38:28.175
I mean it'’s kind of his gold
we'’re after.

457
00:38:28.436 --> 00:38:30.743
In Arabic.
Hirawa means cane.

458
00:38:53.243 --> 00:38:54.767
And that was this gardener.

459
00:38:55.724 --> 00:38:58.684
That'’s good to know.

460
00:38:59.293 --> 00:39:03.428
Prison. Hard to get into.
even harder to get out of.

461
00:39:03.776 --> 00:39:05.255
Especially with
a truckload of gold.

462
00:39:05.604 --> 00:39:08.781
First question.
Where'’s the gold?

463
00:39:09.172 --> 00:39:11.784
We got a couple of contacts
on the inside so we know
the lay of the land.

464
00:39:11.914 --> 00:39:13.351
but we still don'’t know
where the vault is.

465
00:39:13.568 --> 00:39:15.178
Do you have surveillance
photos on this facility?

466
00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.398
Yeah. we have. Come. I show you.

467
00:39:18.051 --> 00:39:21.620
Facility is state-of-the-art.
one of the most modern
prisons on Earth.

468
00:39:21.924 --> 00:39:24.536
And it'’s completely
self-contained--
food. water. everything.

469
00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:26.059
Wait. Go back.

470
00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:30.759
Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. Left.

471
00:39:31.499 --> 00:39:33.458
If the prison'’s self-sustained.

472
00:39:33.762 --> 00:39:36.983
I would expect there'’s
a fully functioning
laundry on the inside.

473
00:39:37.113 --> 00:39:40.334
Yeah. Right next to the kitchen.
Using the same venting system.

474
00:39:40.508 --> 00:39:42.292
That'’s the steam in the photo.

475
00:39:43.163 --> 00:39:45.252
Mm. Right. but it doesn'’t.
does it. really?

476
00:39:45.426 --> 00:39:47.385
Because while my Arabic
is little bit rusty.

477
00:39:47.472 --> 00:39:50.823
I'’m pretty sure...
that'’s a laundry truck.

478
00:39:51.301 --> 00:39:53.608
Meaning Schultz built the prison
without installing

479
00:39:53.695 --> 00:39:55.523
an actual industrial laundry.

480
00:39:55.654 --> 00:39:58.265
Just a system to generate
steam for appearances.

481
00:40:01.747 --> 00:40:03.923
Voila! Now we know
where the gold is.

482
00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:07.187
Right under the shitter.Let'’s go to prison. shall we?

483
00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:12.410
Oh. and by the way.
I only fly first class.

484
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.151
Me too!Oh-ho. congratulations.

485
00:40:15.369 --> 00:40:17.937
Next time we'’ll be sure to book
your ticket on Princess Air.

486
00:40:18.024 --> 00:40:19.286
Mm-hm. What do you
mean. next time?

487
00:40:19.547 --> 00:40:21.897
This entire region
is on high alert.

488
00:40:21.984 --> 00:40:25.510
A group like this.
landing at the airport
will attract attention.

489
00:40:25.597 --> 00:40:27.468
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
point remains the same.

490
00:40:27.903 --> 00:40:30.036
Trains. planes. automobiles.

491
00:40:30.515 --> 00:40:33.518
I'’m flexible...
as long as it'’s first class.

492
00:40:39.175 --> 00:40:40.220
Hmm?

493
00:40:42.135 --> 00:40:43.745
Why isn'’t anyone
saying anything?

494
00:40:47.923 --> 00:40:50.056
Please. tell me you'’re joking!

495
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:53.712
We got to fit in.
Vehicles will be scrutinized.

496
00:40:53.799 --> 00:40:55.583
Camels. Muhammad
will be our guide.

497
00:40:56.715 --> 00:40:58.847
Which one is Muhammad?All of them.

498
00:40:59.065 --> 00:41:01.067
Oh.RINGO: My Muhammad.

499
00:41:01.197 --> 00:41:04.331
There'’s about 30 miles
of virgin desert
to the border of Jazeristan.

500
00:41:04.549 --> 00:41:05.550
Well..

501
00:41:06.551 --> 00:41:08.901
this prison isn'’t going
to rob itself. Let'’s go.

502
00:41:09.118 --> 00:41:12.426
By the way. you look great.Thank you. Don'’t be cheeky.

503
00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.385
Which camel'’s mine.
Can I get this guy?
He looks friendly.

504
00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:30.923
What'’s a nice girl like you
doing in a desert like this?

505
00:41:32.185 --> 00:41:33.447
Believe me. I'’m not so nice.

506
00:41:34.709 --> 00:41:36.885
They didn'’t ask me to join
because of my pleasant
disposition.

507
00:41:37.059 --> 00:41:39.105
So it'’s not because
you couldn'’t find a date.

508
00:41:41.368 --> 00:41:44.066
No. I'’m very good
at finding dates.

509
00:41:45.024 --> 00:41:46.242
Even better at losing them.

510
00:41:47.722 --> 00:41:49.724
You might want to change
your line of work.

511
00:41:50.595 --> 00:41:53.815
Could increase your odds.Says the thief.

512
00:41:56.731 --> 00:41:58.472
No. I decided a long time ago

513
00:41:58.559 --> 00:41:59.908
that if I can'’t be good
to someone.

514
00:42:00.779 --> 00:42:02.563
I can at least try
and be good to everyone.

515
00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.697
Good philosophy.

516
00:42:28.241 --> 00:42:29.372
You know...

517
00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:34.247
They say that people
on their deathbeds...

518
00:42:35.509 --> 00:42:37.337
never regret
the things they did.

519
00:42:37.903 --> 00:42:40.993
just... the things
they didn'’t do.

520
00:42:42.211 --> 00:42:45.040
This sounds like the start of
a conversation you may regret.

521
00:42:47.347 --> 00:42:49.479
We'’re going to do something
very dangerous here soon.

522
00:42:50.698 --> 00:42:52.613
If there'’s some
kind of connection. well...

523
00:42:54.136 --> 00:42:55.573
It would be a shame
if we die

524
00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.705
without
really saying our feelings.

525
00:42:59.925 --> 00:43:02.841
Did you ever think
saying how you feel
might be the reason you die?

526
00:43:04.756 --> 00:43:06.975
Nope. Never crossed my mind.

527
00:43:09.978 --> 00:43:10.979
It'’s not you. Pace.

528
00:43:11.414 --> 00:43:13.460
from an empirical point of view.

529
00:43:13.765 --> 00:43:15.505
you are a very attractive man.

530
00:43:17.856 --> 00:43:20.336
You see I don'’t... date men.

531
00:43:22.643 --> 00:43:23.688
I kill them.

532
00:43:38.441 --> 00:43:40.008
One can only try.

533
00:44:06.078 --> 00:44:09.298
HOPE: Hey.

534
00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:16.262
You okay?

535
00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:19.265
Yeah. I'’m fine.

536
00:44:22.964 --> 00:44:25.401
Just a little scared.Yeah.

537
00:44:27.012 --> 00:44:29.536
Well. it certainly
will have its risks.

538
00:44:30.493 --> 00:44:32.365
Uh. I don'’t mean the prison.

539
00:44:33.801 --> 00:44:36.195
Dad. you'’re doing this
for the right reasons. right?

540
00:44:36.848 --> 00:44:41.417
I mean... you'’re not going to do
like you always do and...

541
00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:43.463
disappear in the final frame?

542
00:44:46.553 --> 00:44:47.597
Do you mean...

543
00:44:49.208 --> 00:44:51.471
The gold?No.

544
00:44:55.083 --> 00:44:57.695
I mean... disappear without me.

545
00:45:02.395 --> 00:45:03.526
Oh. Hope...

546
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.967
I really would like to promise
you that. I really would.

547
00:45:13.928 --> 00:45:16.191
There'’s a beautiful line
I once read in a poem.

548
00:45:17.845 --> 00:45:21.109
"A man travels far to find out
who he really is."

549
00:45:23.459 --> 00:45:24.983
Same goes for you.

550
00:45:27.986 --> 00:45:29.074
Hold steady.

551
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:34.296
Hold steady.

552
00:45:49.355 --> 00:45:51.749
Get some rest.
It'’s a big day tomorrow.

553
00:46:19.602 --> 00:46:21.996
We'’ll be fine here.Why can'’t I stay with my dad?

554
00:46:23.345 --> 00:46:26.566
It'’s too risky. We don't want
them to be able to kill
two birds with one stone.

555
00:46:28.655 --> 00:46:30.788
That'’s comforting.Really?

556
00:46:31.223 --> 00:46:33.138
No. It was a joke.

557
00:46:33.834 --> 00:46:34.922
Hm.

558
00:46:35.227 --> 00:46:37.185
Well. we usually don'’t
like to work with people

559
00:46:37.359 --> 00:46:38.839
who have families
and loved ones.

560
00:46:39.448 --> 00:46:42.887
Brings emotions into play.
And emotions cloud the mind.

561
00:46:48.893 --> 00:46:49.937
What are you doing?

562
00:46:50.285 --> 00:46:52.026
You never know when you have
to improvise on weapons.

563
00:47:00.295 --> 00:47:01.993
All right.

564
00:47:04.343 --> 00:47:05.300
What do you want to do?

565
00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:08.434
Hmm. What kind of drugs
do you have?

566
00:47:09.609 --> 00:47:10.915
I don'’t drink or take drugs.

567
00:47:11.132 --> 00:47:12.917
Really? Maybe you should start.

568
00:47:13.265 --> 00:47:14.962
Just a little something
to take the edge off.

569
00:47:15.441 --> 00:47:17.051
If you want.
I could go score some.

570
00:47:17.225 --> 00:47:18.966
Absolutely not.
that'’s dangerous.

571
00:47:19.532 --> 00:47:20.533
I was joking.

572
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.797
God. you really don'’t have
a sense of humor. do you?

573
00:47:24.189 --> 00:47:25.364
Don'’t really have time for it.

574
00:47:25.886 --> 00:47:27.583
Not much about what I do
is very funny.

575
00:47:31.674 --> 00:47:32.719
Me neither.

576
00:47:40.161 --> 00:47:42.598
You know what? Let'’s focus on
what we love about our work.

577
00:47:43.425 --> 00:47:46.167
Okay. I like to beat people up.

578
00:47:47.908 --> 00:47:49.823
Okay. cool. Yeah.

579
00:47:50.258 --> 00:47:55.916
Well. let'’s say I am a guy
and I'’m coming at you.

580
00:47:56.395 --> 00:47:57.918
A dumb guy.Right. Okay.

581
00:47:58.005 --> 00:48:00.051
But I have a bunch of friends
waiting to back me up. So.

582
00:48:00.138 --> 00:48:02.488
you gotta take
me down in one move.
What'’s your go-to?

583
00:48:02.836 --> 00:48:04.316
One shot?Yeah. that'’s it.

584
00:48:04.664 --> 00:48:06.144
Easy. Punch to the throat.

585
00:48:06.361 --> 00:48:07.710
Not the jewels?No.

586
00:48:07.928 --> 00:48:10.626
Men vary in size and sensitivity
when it comes to their junk.

587
00:48:10.844 --> 00:48:13.542
What may bring one
to his knees might bring
another one pleasure.

588
00:48:13.716 --> 00:48:15.457
but a solid punch
the Adam'’s apple.

589
00:48:16.545 --> 00:48:17.546
Down in a oner.

590
00:48:18.591 --> 00:48:19.897
Cool.Hmm!

591
00:48:21.159 --> 00:48:22.725
You must have one badass dad.

592
00:48:24.031 --> 00:48:25.206
Never knew him.

593
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.644
I'’m sorry.

594
00:48:29.471 --> 00:48:31.343
Yeah. well. me too.

595
00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:37.871
Well. I for one.
would like to thank him.

596
00:48:38.306 --> 00:48:40.569
If he hadn'’t abandoned you
and made you hate men so much.

597
00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:42.223
you wouldn'’t taken up my fight.

598
00:48:45.183 --> 00:48:46.488
That'’s one way to look at it.

599
00:48:47.881 --> 00:48:49.317
You'’re lucky to have
a dad like yours.

600
00:48:49.839 --> 00:48:50.971
He loves you a lot.

601
00:48:52.233 --> 00:48:53.321
Yeah. I guess so.

602
00:48:55.106 --> 00:48:56.150
Still an asshole though.

603
00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.633
Yeah. he is.

604
00:49:02.765 --> 00:49:03.853
Here.

605
00:49:05.681 --> 00:49:07.596
I thought you didn'’t drink.I don'’t.

606
00:49:09.294 --> 00:49:12.384
Let'’s cheers to dads.
The good... and the bad.

607
00:49:22.089 --> 00:49:24.135
All right. ladies
and gentlemen pucker up.

608
00:49:24.396 --> 00:49:26.659
Time to move. Ringo.
don'’t lose interest.

609
00:49:27.921 --> 00:49:31.055
Up you get. Gather round.
ladies and gentlemen.

610
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:32.882
Okay. take a seat.

611
00:49:33.492 --> 00:49:37.235
The problem with gold is.
well. it'’s heavy.

612
00:49:37.452 --> 00:49:38.671
So we'’re gonna need a vehicle

613
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:40.238
that can handle
that kind of weight.

614
00:49:40.325 --> 00:49:41.326
On it.

615
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.892
And to get it out
of the country.

616
00:49:43.067 --> 00:49:44.764
camels aren'’t gonna cut it.

617
00:49:45.286 --> 00:49:46.896
So. we'’re going to need
some kind of transport.

618
00:49:47.245 --> 00:49:49.029
I can.PACE: You can what?

619
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:51.684
Some kind of transport.
my country can provide it.

620
00:49:51.901 --> 00:49:53.903
Princey-poo claims
that he'’s royalty

621
00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:55.514
in a "country" in the Gulf.

622
00:49:55.731 --> 00:49:57.168
I thought you said
you weren'’t a prince.

623
00:49:57.429 --> 00:50:01.085
I said I wasn'’t that prince
but I'’m a prince in my country.

624
00:50:01.215 --> 00:50:04.175
What country?
You ain'’t got no country.

625
00:50:05.437 --> 00:50:07.395
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Ringo.

626
00:50:07.482 --> 00:50:09.180
By the way.
just off the topic here.

627
00:50:09.876 --> 00:50:11.008
Is that your given name?

628
00:50:11.356 --> 00:50:15.360
Yeah. given by me. In honor
of the greatest Beatle.

629
00:50:15.447 --> 00:50:17.405
Here we go again.What you mean here we go again?

630
00:50:17.492 --> 00:50:18.841
What. a black man
can'’t like the Beatles?

631
00:50:19.538 --> 00:50:21.670
See. he'’s a true visionary
with his instrument.

632
00:50:22.149 --> 00:50:24.717
You guys don'’t understand.
He was the first rock and roll
drummer--

633
00:50:24.934 --> 00:50:26.719
influenced every
rock drummer after him.

634
00:50:26.849 --> 00:50:29.417
Even the way that
he held his sticks.Seriously?

635
00:50:30.636 --> 00:50:31.898
I don'’t joke about Ringo.

636
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:35.815
It'’s better just to accept it
and don'’t karaoke with him.

637
00:50:39.558 --> 00:50:41.777
You suck. you suck!

638
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:47.000
RINGO: How you gonna say
"Yellow Submarine" ain'’t
a real Beatles song?

639
00:50:47.131 --> 00:50:49.437
I'’m just saying
he'’s an unappreciated singer.

640
00:50:49.524 --> 00:50:52.179
I'’m so glad I asked.
Ringo. we'’re gonna need a list

641
00:50:52.266 --> 00:50:54.790
of all the outside
prison contractors.

642
00:50:54.877 --> 00:50:55.965
No doubt.

643
00:50:56.314 --> 00:50:58.533
And you certainly can'’t
be drilling or tumbling.

644
00:50:58.664 --> 00:51:00.144
We'’re going to have
to blow the vault.

645
00:51:00.231 --> 00:51:01.710
Hope. you'’ve had experience

646
00:51:01.884 --> 00:51:03.843
with phone boxes in
the Peace Corps. is that right?

647
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:05.714
Yeah?I need that skill set.

648
00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:08.761
And anything else
I taught you at a very
inappropriate age.

649
00:51:08.891 --> 00:51:11.242
Violet. we need to find
out where Schultz is

650
00:51:11.416 --> 00:51:13.461
when he isn'’t at the prison.
We need surveillance.

651
00:51:13.722 --> 00:51:16.377
Already on it.
And it looks like you guys
better grab your robes.

652
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:19.554
Schultz has a lunch
reservation in 45 minutes.

653
00:51:19.728 --> 00:51:21.295
All right handsome. let'’s go.

654
00:51:21.643 --> 00:51:23.080
That's what I'’m talking about!

655
00:51:28.911 --> 00:51:29.956
Welcome. sir.

656
00:51:41.228 --> 00:51:43.883
PACE: There it is.
Watch that case.

657
00:51:46.494 --> 00:51:50.150
You see how heavy that was?Like a fat lady.

658
00:51:51.586 --> 00:51:53.501
PACE: Looks like Schultz
is making a withdrawal

659
00:51:53.632 --> 00:51:55.677
for our friend Abu Hirawa.

660
00:51:57.026 --> 00:51:58.071
HOPE: We have to stop him.

661
00:51:58.985 --> 00:52:01.292
I'’m sorry. Hope.
you can'’t win them all.

662
00:52:01.683 --> 00:52:05.339
We don'’t know who
this guy is and by now.
he'’s just in the wind.

663
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.558
Jason Quick.

664
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:09.691
Jason Quick? He looks good.

665
00:52:10.823 --> 00:52:14.043
He got the drugs
out of his system
and he put the jihad back in.

666
00:52:14.305 --> 00:52:15.654
That other guy in the photo.

667
00:52:15.828 --> 00:52:18.091
it'’s the Vice President
of the Bank of Jazeristan.

668
00:52:18.178 --> 00:52:19.527
He'’s trading
the gold for cash.

669
00:52:19.745 --> 00:52:21.355
Yeah. and the bank
opens tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

670
00:52:21.877 --> 00:52:24.402
After that. Jason boards
an afternoon flight...

671
00:52:25.838 --> 00:52:28.145
at which point
he will be "in the wind."

672
00:52:30.799 --> 00:52:32.105
What you got there?
What are you reading?

673
00:52:32.758 --> 00:52:36.327
I picked these up at the souk.Okay.

674
00:52:37.066 --> 00:52:39.852
What?Nothing.

675
00:53:32.687 --> 00:53:34.820
I gave your man gold.
it'’s not my fault he'’s a thief.

676
00:53:35.081 --> 00:53:36.822
ABU HIRAWA: Was.I'’m sorry?

677
00:53:36.909 --> 00:53:39.085
ABU HIRAWA:
Was a thief. Except that...

678
00:53:39.477 --> 00:53:42.567
He wasn'’t.I'’m sorry. I'm not following.

679
00:53:42.915 --> 00:53:46.266
ABU HIRAWA:
On the journey from is to was.
all men tell the truth.

680
00:53:46.701 --> 00:53:50.227
A man'’s eyes cannot lie.
Not to me.

681
00:53:50.705 --> 00:53:52.707
Especially when
I hold them in my hand.

682
00:53:52.968 --> 00:53:54.535
If I thought it was you.

683
00:53:54.709 --> 00:53:56.624
we would not be having
this conversation.

684
00:53:57.234 --> 00:54:00.237
Ah. right. well...
that'’s that then.

685
00:54:00.411 --> 00:54:03.152
If there'’s nothing else.
I'’ve got a bit of company
at the moment.

686
00:54:03.283 --> 00:54:06.504
ABU HIRAWA:
There is a very large operation
taking place in the near future.

687
00:54:06.678 --> 00:54:08.332
but you may leave
your briefcase at home.

688
00:54:09.028 --> 00:54:11.987
You need something much
larger for this transaction.

689
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:14.990
Ah. right.
who'’s my contact this time?

690
00:54:15.426 --> 00:54:17.602
ABU HIRAWA: Me.You? Lovely.

691
00:54:17.906 --> 00:54:20.082
ABU HIRAWA: Three days.SCHULTZ: All right. thanks.

692
00:54:21.693 --> 00:54:23.085
VIOLET: Oh shit.

693
00:54:26.393 --> 00:54:27.612
Agreed.

694
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.441
Hirawa'’s coming
here to get his gold.

695
00:54:31.833 --> 00:54:35.576
That'’s the bad news. The piss
in our punch bowl bad news...

696
00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:37.535
is this guy.

697
00:54:37.883 --> 00:54:40.059
Khairat Reda is
a London-based banker.

698
00:54:40.407 --> 00:54:43.236
Top brass of the Brotherhood
and he arrives here
in three days.

699
00:54:43.541 --> 00:54:46.195
Hirawa is the finger puppet.
And this man is the hand.

700
00:54:46.457 --> 00:54:48.763
So we accelerate the schedule.
Hit the prison
before they get there.

701
00:54:48.894 --> 00:54:52.637
Uh-uh. We can'’t go
into this thing half-cocked.
We'’re not ready.

702
00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.814
I'’m ready. Are you ready?

703
00:54:58.425 --> 00:54:59.513
Huh! We are fully cock.

704
00:55:01.167 --> 00:55:04.213
Cocked. not cock.Yes. cock.

705
00:55:04.866 --> 00:55:07.173
Yes. cock for you.
no cock for me.

706
00:55:08.174 --> 00:55:09.218
I need a drink.

707
00:55:12.221 --> 00:55:14.354
Okay. here we go.

708
00:55:14.702 --> 00:55:17.705
The only way this operation
is gonna run smoothly

709
00:55:17.836 --> 00:55:20.882
is if the prison
isn'’t running smoothly.

710
00:55:21.056 --> 00:55:23.145
Fortunately. we got a few guys
on the inside.

711
00:55:24.538 --> 00:55:26.975
PACE: And working in the place
where we have direct control

712
00:55:27.367 --> 00:55:29.543
over the prisoners'’
physical well-being.

713
00:55:29.717 --> 00:55:31.893
Any health issue that
needs more than ten beds...

714
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.244
PACE: Well...

715
00:55:35.462 --> 00:55:37.682
We gotta get them out. now!

716
00:55:38.465 --> 00:55:40.815
Let'’s just say they're going
to need more than that.

717
00:55:48.388 --> 00:55:51.478
And we walk out the front door.Well. maybe not.

718
00:55:52.653 --> 00:55:54.089
Let'’s play that one by ear.
shall we?

719
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:59.573
Abdullah. are you aware
of how many violations
you have going on here?

720
00:55:59.747 --> 00:56:02.620
No. we just passed
inspection a few months ago.

721
00:56:03.577 --> 00:56:07.886
Now. I'’m asking.
where are you buying all of your
refrigeration equipment from?

722
00:56:08.016 --> 00:56:10.497
Pacific Industries. Yes.They'’re still in business?

723
00:56:10.758 --> 00:56:12.499
Well. you need to get them
on the phone right away.

724
00:56:12.586 --> 00:56:15.633
We can get some new steamers
down here. get you up to code.

725
00:56:15.763 --> 00:56:18.940
You'’re with the ministry
of Public Health. Mr.. uh...

726
00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:22.944
Lionel L. Zagred?RINGO: I am.

727
00:56:23.075 --> 00:56:25.817
I have a friend there.
Maybe I should call him
so I can sort this out.

728
00:56:25.991 --> 00:56:27.558
Are you aware of the GSO?

729
00:56:28.297 --> 00:56:31.475
The Gulf Standard Organization.

730
00:56:31.605 --> 00:56:34.565
They'’re responsible for all
of the food development

731
00:56:34.695 --> 00:56:37.089
and standards going on
here in the Gulf region.

732
00:56:37.306 --> 00:56:41.093
So you could only imagine
how it'’d probably look
if such a prized institution

733
00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:43.791
were to fail an inspection.

734
00:56:43.922 --> 00:56:46.751
Now. if you ask me personally.
Jazeristan shouldn'’t care

735
00:56:46.838 --> 00:56:48.622
about the opinions
of other countries. right?

736
00:56:48.709 --> 00:56:50.581
So if you want-- you want
to call your friend.

737
00:56:50.711 --> 00:56:54.062
you get him on the horn.
call them. right away!They'’re not friends.

738
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.891
It won'’t be me that will be
upsetting the royal family.

739
00:56:57.022 --> 00:56:58.980
GUARD: It'’s my friend's cousin.
and I don'’t even know him.

740
00:57:01.505 --> 00:57:02.636
MAN: Pacific Industrial?

741
00:57:02.723 --> 00:57:04.333
Would you happen to
have any of the...

742
00:57:04.856 --> 00:57:07.380
Vanguard K2350.

743
00:57:07.554 --> 00:57:10.992
Vanguard K2350 in stock. please?

744
00:57:12.385 --> 00:57:15.257
You do? Great. I want two sent
as quickly as possible.

745
00:57:15.693 --> 00:57:17.390
To the Dola Penal
Corrections Institute.

746
00:57:23.004 --> 00:57:24.615
What do you mean you
don'’t have any at hand?

747
00:57:24.745 --> 00:57:26.530
You just literally
two seconds ago told me
you had five.

748
00:57:27.008 --> 00:57:28.619
This is not good.

749
00:57:31.404 --> 00:57:34.320
What did they say?It seems they don'’t
have any. at hand.

750
00:57:34.407 --> 00:57:36.844
But they can rush order them
to us and have them
to us in a week.

751
00:57:41.675 --> 00:57:42.763
Answer that phone. Abdullah.

752
00:57:44.504 --> 00:57:46.854
What if
it'’s the royal family?

753
00:57:47.115 --> 00:57:48.160
Answer the phone.

754
00:57:54.427 --> 00:57:58.257
Hello. sir. This is Pacific
Industrial here.

755
00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:02.217
I'’d like to apologize
for the mix-up we had
over here on our end.

756
00:58:02.609 --> 00:58:06.787
We do in fact have
the 2350 in stock.

757
00:58:06.874 --> 00:58:09.660
We had an unexpected
delivery cancellation.

758
00:58:09.921 --> 00:58:13.315
In fact. one of our men
is in the field as we speak.

759
00:58:14.229 --> 00:58:16.493
Would tomorrow afternoon
be okay for you?

760
00:58:16.884 --> 00:58:20.453
That would be fantastic.
I can'’t thank you
enough for this.

761
00:58:20.845 --> 00:58:24.805
That'’s very kind of you. sir.
much appreciated. good day now.

762
00:58:27.329 --> 00:58:28.417
Cup of coffee?

763
00:59:09.415 --> 00:59:12.244
All right. We go in
after lunch tomorrow.

764
00:59:13.462 --> 00:59:16.074
Hey. Violet. couldn'’t have
found a small worker?

765
00:59:16.422 --> 00:59:19.686
No. it just so happened that
the biggest lush at the company
was also very large.

766
00:59:20.252 --> 00:59:23.124
Is this blood on here?Good luck.

767
00:59:23.472 --> 00:59:24.561
WICK: Violet!

768
00:59:30.305 --> 00:59:33.178
But I do need you to fill out
a little bit more
information right here.

769
00:59:33.265 --> 00:59:36.007
But they haven'’t been cleared!Abdullah. focus!

770
00:59:36.137 --> 00:59:38.705
For your family.Oh yes. I'’ll get them cleared.

771
00:59:38.792 --> 00:59:40.881
Sign. Sign. Right away.Please. yes. yes.
Watch your step.

772
01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:10.563
WICK: Whoa. whoa.

773
01:00:10.868 --> 01:00:13.958
Dude. you have anger issues.

774
01:00:14.175 --> 01:00:16.134
Started from childhood.
Come on.

775
01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:23.576
That ought to do it. let'’s go
check on their progress.

776
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:25.926
No. they will handle it.
They will let us know.

777
01:00:26.013 --> 01:00:28.189
I'’m a soon-to-be captain.
you cannot keep treating me
like this!

778
01:00:28.363 --> 01:00:29.538
Let'’s go check
on their progress.

779
01:00:29.713 --> 01:00:31.802
Okay. Abdullah. you'’re
so angry. let'’s go.

780
01:00:41.115 --> 01:00:42.508
Age before beauty.

781
01:00:42.856 --> 01:00:46.033
RINGO: All these new steamers.
this has worked out famously!

782
01:00:46.164 --> 01:00:51.125
Abdullah. K2350.

783
01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:53.693
They look the same.

784
01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:56.783
But how closely
have you examined?

785
01:00:56.914 --> 01:00:58.959
Not so much.Exactly.

786
01:00:59.525 --> 01:01:04.138
See. same chassis?
Internal component
entirely different.

787
01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:11.972
No.

788
01:01:14.801 --> 01:01:18.065
What are you doing?
You have to break-in first.

789
01:01:18.979 --> 01:01:20.024
Right?

790
01:01:20.546 --> 01:01:24.724
I mean-- They are your steamers.
if you want to turn on.

791
01:01:24.811 --> 01:01:26.944
you break. you buy.
you own the steamers!

792
01:01:27.379 --> 01:01:29.120
No. no. I don'’t.
the royal family does.

793
01:01:29.207 --> 01:01:32.427
When can we use them?Eh... an hour or two.

794
01:01:33.037 --> 01:01:35.561
Give the internal
component time to break in.

795
01:01:36.301 --> 01:01:38.346
I love that you
listen to me now.

796
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.174
This is like we
build a relationship.

797
01:01:40.348 --> 01:01:42.786
I feel like I must hug. I hug.

798
01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:45.397
I'’m-- I'm sorry.

799
01:01:45.614 --> 01:01:48.356
Part of my culture.
I'm-- I'’m European.

800
01:01:48.574 --> 01:01:50.141
You'’re European.Yes.

801
01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:54.580
Finnish. From-- from Finland.Oh.

802
01:01:54.754 --> 01:01:58.497
We big on hugs. We are.
big hug. I love to hug.

803
01:01:58.845 --> 01:02:02.936
Oh yes. yes. yes...

804
01:02:03.154 --> 01:02:05.069
Oh yes. now I have one more
thing for you to do.

805
01:02:05.417 --> 01:02:08.115
For you to sign and then
I'’m out of your hair. I finish!

806
01:02:15.557 --> 01:02:16.558
Okay.

807
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:28.135
Wow.

808
01:02:36.361 --> 01:02:38.319
Seemed like a good idea
a few days ago.

809
01:02:38.885 --> 01:02:40.713
This is going to take
a bloody miracle.

810
01:02:42.062 --> 01:02:43.107
Indeed.

811
01:02:43.934 --> 01:02:46.763
Let'’s go. We'’ve got
a busy morning ahead.

812
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:03.518
Bon Appetit.

813
01:03:04.258 --> 01:03:05.651
Born up a tree.

814
01:03:43.384 --> 01:03:47.127
It'’s amazing the bacteria
you can find at a local
university. huh?

815
01:03:47.519 --> 01:03:49.521
They really should
protect it better.
you know that.

816
01:03:49.782 --> 01:03:51.653
I hope there'’s
no harmful side effects.

817
01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.786
Sure. there shouldn'’t be those.

818
01:04:04.318 --> 01:04:06.103
ABDULLAH: Get these people
to the infirmary immediately!

819
01:04:06.277 --> 01:04:08.845
And for God sakes.
have someone clean this up. Now!

820
01:04:23.163 --> 01:04:24.904
Well?GUARD: We'’re not sure. sir.

821
01:04:25.122 --> 01:04:27.820
But a large number of prisoners
and staff start showing

822
01:04:27.907 --> 01:04:31.693
some sign of poisoning.
acute abdominal pain.
nausea. vomiting.

823
01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:33.782
It could be
some sort of overdose.

824
01:04:35.132 --> 01:04:36.176
So...

825
01:04:37.482 --> 01:04:40.441
All this is just a little
bit of bad weed?

826
01:04:41.703 --> 01:04:43.575
Should we. maybe.
call in the National Police?

827
01:04:45.707 --> 01:04:46.926
Are you high?

828
01:04:47.927 --> 01:04:51.322
Yes. sir-- I mean no. sir.
That would be bad idea.

829
01:04:58.024 --> 01:05:01.201
Check every flight. hotel.

WHISPERS: Let'’s go.

838
01:06:16.798 --> 01:06:20.454

Nobody. yet.

844
01:06:56.925 --> 01:07:01.974
See I have to test every patient
and the source of contamination.

845
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.978
Could be something
with simple explanation.

846
01:07:06.326 --> 01:07:09.416
or something much.
much more serious.

847
01:07:09.895 --> 01:07:12.680
As I said. will not be
able to determine that

848
01:07:12.811 --> 01:07:14.813
until I properly
assess the situation.

849
01:07:15.248 --> 01:07:19.165
We'’re going to need
a Hazmat cleanup immediately.

850
01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:27.782

to become international crisis.

How are we doing on time?

860
01:08:24.622 --> 01:08:25.666
Running out of it.

861
01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.495
How in the hell are we
going to get explosives
down that tiny hole?

862
01:08:30.454 --> 01:08:33.805
We'’re not.
We'’re building the Hindenburg.

863

Hi. I have been looking for you.

At least half. yes.

Golden showers.

971
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:56.019
Go. go!

972
01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:16.082
RINGO: So here'’s where we're at.
None of us were armed.

973
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:18.519
We wanted Schultz to think
he had the upper hand.

974
01:18:18.737 --> 01:18:20.478
Plus we ain'’t want
to get shot at.

975
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:21.958
Hello.

976
01:18:33.056 --> 01:18:36.363
RINGO: It'’s about now
that Schultz realized
he didn'’t really catch us.

977
01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:38.235
Fabulous.

978
01:18:42.369 --> 01:18:44.981
RINGO: Hold up. pay attention
to those white cars.

979
01:18:45.372 --> 01:18:47.331
How would anyone know
where we were gonna be

980
01:18:47.418 --> 01:18:49.246
before the chase even began?

981
01:18:49.681 --> 01:18:51.901
It'’s called an anonymous tip.

982
01:18:52.162 --> 01:18:56.035
We wanted to get caught
because we had a story to tell.

983
01:19:36.641 --> 01:19:37.860
So. it'’s still in the prison.
then?

984
01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:39.252
Not exactly.

985
01:19:49.872 --> 01:19:51.221
Stop. What are you moving?

986
01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:54.441
We got a. uh. we got
a repair order right here.

987
01:19:55.486 --> 01:19:56.530
Here you go.

988
01:19:59.446 --> 01:20:00.708
Right there.

989
01:20:04.103 --> 01:20:05.583
Still going to have
to take a look at it.

990
01:20:09.543 --> 01:20:11.894
You betcha. Here you go.

991
01:20:13.852 --> 01:20:15.071
Look at that.

992
01:20:15.767 --> 01:20:16.855
See?

993
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:22.600
I heard some
inmate damaged it.

994
01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:24.558
Oh. yeah.Crazy bastard.

995
01:20:24.907 --> 01:20:27.648
The bullocks. huh?

996
01:20:27.953 --> 01:20:30.521
Mutt's nuts.
Okay. have a good day.Yeah. yeah.

997
01:20:42.446 --> 01:20:43.926
SOLDIER: Put the gun down!

998
01:20:44.448 --> 01:20:45.623
RINGO: I know
what you'’re thinking.

999
01:20:46.015 --> 01:20:48.104
Who the hell are these dudes
and where did they come from?

1000
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:50.976
Check it. Prince told us
he'’d have his soldiers

1001
01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:53.936
just hiding and waiting for
Schultz to brandish a weapon.

1002
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:56.547
And then these guys rolled up
dressed like extras

1003
01:20:56.677 --> 01:20:58.984
in a bad
Salvadorian action movie.

1004
01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:01.552
No way in hell
these are real soldiers.

1005
01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:02.858
But I played along.

1006
01:21:03.684 --> 01:21:08.298
You can'’t be brandishing
a weapon around a foreign
military aircraft.

1007
01:21:08.385 --> 01:21:10.169
especially from
a sovereign nation of. uh...

1008
01:21:10.343 --> 01:21:11.954
Salwa.Salwa.

1009
01:21:12.302 --> 01:21:13.825
Your country.My country.

1010
01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:17.220
Just-- just-- just a sec.
just a sec.

1011
01:21:18.612 --> 01:21:20.049
Get it done. yes.

1012
01:21:24.183 --> 01:21:27.534
Looks like your daddy dearest
didn'’t come through
for you today. ho'’.

1013
01:21:33.018 --> 01:21:34.106
Finish her off.

1014
01:21:36.456 --> 01:21:38.589
Reservation'’s
under Hope Pace.

1015
01:21:40.678 --> 01:21:42.375
VIOLET: I'’ve been waiting
for that call.

1016
01:22:28.247 --> 01:22:29.901
Fucking men.

1017
01:22:30.075 --> 01:22:31.033
Well. that'’s that then.

1018
01:22:34.123 --> 01:22:35.994
We haven'’t been introduced.
I'’m Hope.

1019
01:22:36.908 --> 01:22:39.911
RINGO: That punch was the least
painful thing that happened
to Schultz that day.

1020
01:22:40.564 --> 01:22:42.827
Inside of one of those
white cars I pointed out?

1021
01:22:43.523 --> 01:22:44.872
Was Abu Hirawa.

1022
01:22:46.048 --> 01:22:50.400
Not my fault.

1023
01:22:51.792 --> 01:22:53.969
It'’s okay. I believe you.

1024
01:22:56.232 --> 01:22:58.190
But there are those who are
not interested in the truth...

1025
01:22:59.191 --> 01:23:02.368
Only in justice.
It won'’t come swiftly.

1026
01:23:07.199 --> 01:23:09.158
RINGO: The next day. some
talking head reported

1027
01:23:09.288 --> 01:23:10.811
the food poisoning
at the prison.

1028
01:23:11.116 --> 01:23:13.858
There was no mention
of any gold.

1029
01:23:14.206 --> 01:23:15.468
Like I said.

1030
01:23:15.773 --> 01:23:18.950
you'’re gonna rob a bank
make sure it ain'’t reported.

1031
01:23:22.345 --> 01:23:26.914
But don'’t you feel it like I

1032
01:23:27.132 --> 01:23:33.138
Cash it cash it yeah cash it

1033
01:23:33.399 --> 01:23:37.838
So what you gonna do

1034
01:23:39.579 --> 01:23:44.802
Or no we want to

1035
01:23:45.455 --> 01:23:46.978
Leave any of them alive?

1036
01:23:47.065 --> 01:23:48.806
Of course not.RINGO: Good.

1037
01:23:54.812 --> 01:23:58.555
Where'’s my dad?Sh-- I don'’t know. he had to
drive the truck here.

1038
01:24:02.211 --> 01:24:05.823
Oh. no.Oh. no what? We got it.
This is good news.

1039
01:24:06.084 --> 01:24:07.955
No.He'’s around here somewhere.

1040
01:24:08.086 --> 01:24:08.956
No.

1041
01:24:10.784 --> 01:24:12.221
I have a terrible
feeling he'’s not.

1042
01:24:20.446 --> 01:24:21.578
WICK: Oh. my God.

1043
01:24:23.188 --> 01:24:24.363
VIOLET: It'’s the original.

1044
01:24:26.844 --> 01:24:28.715
Where'’s the gold?He took it.

1045
01:24:30.282 --> 01:24:31.327
And he'’s not coming back.

1046
01:24:31.501 --> 01:24:34.939
No. no. no. no. no. no.
no. this can'’t be.

1047
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:37.246
No. it can be.
it can so easily be.

1048
01:24:37.985 --> 01:24:40.466
Shit. I am so. so sorry.
I'’m the one who vouched for him.

1049
01:24:40.553 --> 01:24:41.815
I brought him into
this whole thing.

1050
01:24:42.338 --> 01:24:44.079
After a lifetime
of disappointment.
I should have known better...

1051
01:24:46.298 --> 01:24:47.386
Far better.

1052
01:25:08.668 --> 01:25:09.669
Dad?

1053
01:25:11.367 --> 01:25:12.411
Yes.

1054
01:25:14.718 --> 01:25:15.980
You stole the gold.

1055
01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:20.115
I did.

1056
01:25:21.159 --> 01:25:22.552
From us?

1057
01:25:24.467 --> 01:25:25.511
Yep.

1058
01:25:25.903 --> 01:25:27.513
Then what the hell
you still doing here?

1059
01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:31.691
Hopefully... fixing things.

1060
01:25:35.695 --> 01:25:37.132
I cleaned it up a little.

1061
01:25:39.612 --> 01:25:40.700
Oh.

1062
01:25:42.659 --> 01:25:43.660
Thank you.

1063
01:25:44.226 --> 01:25:46.184
I love you.I love you. too.

1064
01:25:50.406 --> 01:25:51.450
Uh. guys...

1065
01:25:51.972 --> 01:25:53.322
ALL: Shh...

1066
01:25:53.713 --> 01:25:55.541
What are you shushing me.
we got stuff to do.

1067
01:25:56.499 --> 01:25:58.979
You know what. this is
cute moment and everything

1068
01:25:59.110 --> 01:26:02.331
but we got a whole Sal.
big Sal-- Sal-wa?

1069
01:26:02.505 --> 01:26:03.506
Salwan.

1070
01:26:03.767 --> 01:26:06.639
Salwan cargo plane
revved up and ready to go.

1071
01:26:06.857 --> 01:26:09.729
Well. let'’s get the hell
out of Dodge. Grab the bird.

1072
01:26:10.077 --> 01:26:11.905
My man.PACE: Yes.

1073
01:26:17.781 --> 01:26:20.087
RINGO: So. we grabbed the bird
and got the hell out of Dodge

1074
01:26:20.218 --> 01:26:21.654
on Prince'’s country's
cargo plane.

1075
01:26:22.829 --> 01:26:24.918
Having a cargo plane
almost made me believe

1076
01:26:25.005 --> 01:26:26.572
he was actually a prince.

1077
01:26:27.138 --> 01:26:29.532
I said almost.

1078
01:26:31.098 --> 01:26:32.883
Yo Ringo! Got your drink.Hey!

1079
01:26:33.013 --> 01:26:34.928
Prince. for you.Thank you.

1080
01:26:35.538 --> 01:26:38.541
Hey. you all got umbrellas
where the hell is my umbrella?

1081
01:26:38.845 --> 01:26:40.499
I want an umbrella.
what type of shit is this?

1082
01:26:41.326 --> 01:26:44.808
This is the life. I mean.
this is always my life.

1083
01:26:44.938 --> 01:26:47.550
Man. I can'’t believe
you'’re actually a prince.

1084
01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:48.812
I mean. in the animal world.

1085
01:26:48.942 --> 01:26:50.988
your parents would have
left you. Or eaten you.

1086
01:26:51.118 --> 01:26:53.904
Mm. A little training.
some skintight leather.

1087
01:26:54.296 --> 01:26:55.949
I could see myself
being a Misfit.

1088
01:26:57.429 --> 01:26:58.952
Don'’t even think about it.

1089
01:27:00.302 --> 01:27:02.478
I'’d like to start by
getting to know you again...

1090
01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:04.436
in my retirement.

1091
01:27:04.784 --> 01:27:07.047
Or maybe we can get to know
each other without retiring.

1092
01:27:09.572 --> 01:27:12.183
Yeah. Dad. What do you say?
Are you a Misfit?

1093
01:27:17.493 --> 01:27:19.103
No. actually. I think...

1094
01:27:21.453 --> 01:27:24.108
I think I fit in just fine.

1095
01:27:24.761 --> 01:27:26.676
Here'’s to us. guys.

1096
01:27:27.459 --> 01:27:29.069
