3
00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:21.493
- When is a door not a door?

4
00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:22.858
- Sorry?

5
00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:26.492
- When is a door not a door?

6
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:30.824
- She doesn't understand.

7
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.057
- Well. it's a riddle.

8
00:01:33.124 --> 00:01:34.557
I think she understands
perfectly.

9
00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:37.557
So I'll ask one more time.

10
00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:41.491
When is a door not a door?

11
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:43.023
- When it's "ajar."

12
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.490
- Like one of those.

13
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.490
The jar I'm looking for
has a special symbol on it.

14
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.122
a triskelion.
three spirals connected.

15
00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.789
- We don't know what
you're talking about.

16
00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:57.222
Maybe you should leave.

17
00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.254
- Oh.

18
00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:02.589
It's a very special jar.
actually.

19
00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.854
It was made from the wood
of a sacred tree

20
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:08.921
and used to capture
a dark Kitsune--

21
00:02:08.988 --> 00:02:12.153
a trickster spirit
called Nogitsune.

22
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.688
- Well. all these jars
contain are teas and spices.

23
00:02:15.753 --> 00:02:17.653
- So whatever it is you
came here looking for--

24
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.487
- You know exactly what I came
here looking for. Mr. Dunbar.

25
00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:32.486
You all do.

26
00:03:07.483 --> 00:03:08.382
Hikari!

27
00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:19.147
- No!

28
00:03:22.582 --> 00:03:23.614
- No!

29
00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:27.781
You don't know
what you're doing!

30
00:03:27.847 --> 00:03:31.781
- I've been searching
for this for years.

31
00:03:31.847 --> 00:03:34.213
I know precisely what I'm doing.

32
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.546
- You can't control it.

33
00:03:36.613 --> 00:03:37.513
- I don't want to.

34
00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:51.045
- Set me free.

35
00:03:51.112 --> 00:03:52.912
- Not until
you make me a promise.

36
00:03:52.978 --> 00:03:56.811
- What fool would ask a promise
from a trickster spirit?

37
00:03:56.878 --> 00:03:59.378
- Call it a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

38
00:03:59.478 --> 00:04:02.478
If you're as all powerful and
omniscient as they say.

39
00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:04.910
then you already know
what I want.

40
00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:08.544
- You want retribution

41
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.610
against him.

42
00:04:11.677 --> 00:04:14.943
his friends.

43
00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:19.076
and everyone he loves.

44
00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:22.276
Set me free

45
00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:26.509
and we'll play a new game.

46
00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:28.476
a game of chaos.

47
00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:30.908
strife.

48
00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:34.208
and pain!

49
00:04:58.773 --> 00:04:59.839
- You said it wouldn't bite.

50
00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:01.639
- I said it wouldn't bite me.

51
00:05:01.706 --> 00:05:03.138
But that's also
because I wouldn't

52
00:05:03.205 --> 00:05:07.138
put my hand in front of
the mouth of a frightened dog.

53
00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:08.705
- Thanks for the advice.

54
00:05:08.772 --> 00:05:10.304
You got any idea how we're going
to get it out of there?

55
00:05:10.371 --> 00:05:12.204
- I have someone coming
who has a special talent

56
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:13.538
for these kinds of things.

57
00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.371
He runs the animal shelter
next to my clinic.

58
00:05:15.472 --> 00:05:18.471
Trust me. he's highly qualified.

59
00:05:18.537 --> 00:05:19.937
We even have a nickname for him.

60
00:05:20.004 --> 00:05:21.471
- Oh yeah? What?

61
00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:24.170
- We call him "The Alpha."

62
00:05:41.502 --> 00:05:42.769
- The girl climbed out.

63
00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:44.234
tried to pull it out.
lost her footing.

64
00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:47.734
and ended up falling in too.

65
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:48.834
Is that all you got?

66
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:50.168
No protective gear?
No gloves?

67
00:05:50.234 --> 00:05:51.534
- I don't get bit.

68
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:54.067
Even if I did. I usually
heal pretty fast.

69
00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:57.200
- Well. even so...

70
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.767
- No! He's gonna bite!

71
00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:02.100
- Hey there.

72
00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:03.467
My name is Scott.

73
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.733
I'm going to help
get you guys out of here.

74
00:06:29.197 --> 00:06:30.698
- Scott. hurry! Come on!

75
00:06:30.764 --> 00:06:31.697
Get out of there!

76
00:06:42.464 --> 00:06:43.663
- All right. climb onto me.

77
00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:44.896
Climb onto me.

78
00:06:58.062 --> 00:06:59.962
- Come on. Alicia.

79
00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:01.227
I got you.

80
00:07:19.493 --> 00:07:22.060
- That was close.

81
00:07:24.092 --> 00:07:25.493
Hey. Alicia? You guys?

82
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.592
Let's go see the paramedics. OK?

83
00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:32.459
- What do you guys
call him again?

84
00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:34.091
- The Alpha.

85
00:07:34.158 --> 00:07:36.324
- Right. like a dog.

86
00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:39.258
- No. like a wolf.

87
00:08:48.952 --> 00:08:51.217
- Good boy.

88
00:08:51.284 --> 00:08:53.284
- OK. Come here. buddy.

89
00:08:58.117 --> 00:09:00.151
Do you know why
Cooper bit the lieutenant?

90
00:09:00.217 --> 00:09:01.451
- Because he was scared?

91
00:09:01.484 --> 00:09:02.951
- He was scared for you.

92
00:09:03.016 --> 00:09:06.983
It's one of the best parts
about dogs. they fight for us.

93
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.283
Remember. the same way that we
see them as part of our family.

94
00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:11.816
they see us
as part of their pack.

95
00:09:24.214 --> 00:09:25.615
- There's still time.

96
00:09:28.214 --> 00:09:30.048
- Oh. I know.

97
00:09:30.114 --> 00:09:31.848
Yeah. I'll have kids
one of these days.

98
00:09:31.914 --> 00:09:35.914
after I find someone.
or someone finds me. I guess.

99
00:09:35.981 --> 00:09:40.713
- Yeah. I meant there's still
time to beat traffic.

100
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.513
But if you want to talk.
there's still time for that too.

101
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.879
- I think I was just.
maybe feeling kind of. uh--

102
00:09:49.946 --> 00:09:51.447
- Wistful.

103
00:09:53.447 --> 00:09:56.979
It means a kind of
longing or regret.

104
00:09:57.046 --> 00:09:59.446
a sort of melancholy
about the past

105
00:09:59.512 --> 00:10:01.479
and the choices we've made.

106
00:10:04.211 --> 00:10:06.377
- Wistful.

107
00:10:06.445 --> 00:10:08.845
- Why don't you lock up?
I'll get my stuff.

108
00:10:25.909 --> 00:10:27.309
I didn't see him.

109
00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:29.342
I took my eyes off the road
for. like. two seconds!

110
00:10:29.409 --> 00:10:30.543
- Quiet!

111
00:11:17.605 --> 00:11:19.071
Oh! Jesus!

112
00:11:22.938 --> 00:11:24.138
Hey.

113
00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:27.638
Shit. dude.

114
00:11:27.704 --> 00:11:29.303
You know you could just
use the front door. right?

115
00:11:29.438 --> 00:11:33.637
- I never use the front door.

116
00:11:33.703 --> 00:11:35.570
Especially when it's not safe.

117
00:11:35.637 --> 00:11:37.703
- Who says it's not safe?

118
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:44.736
- You're seeing her too.

119
00:11:46.436 --> 00:11:48.436
I mean. I've dreamt about her.

120
00:11:48.469 --> 00:11:50.035
You know. now and then
over the years

121
00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:55.101
I've had images flicker in front
of my eyes like blurry photos.

122
00:11:55.168 --> 00:11:59.435
And then. two weeks ago.
something changed.

123
00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:02.535
Those random images

124
00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:05.700
flickering through
my head got clearer.

125
00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:08.600
I saw flashes of her crying out.

126
00:12:08.667 --> 00:12:10.434
silently screaming in pain.

127
00:12:10.434 --> 00:12:11.434
in agony.

128
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.866
She was suffering.

129
00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:16.199
- Allison.

130
00:12:16.266 --> 00:12:20.433
- But I started seeing her face
more and more.

131
00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:23.533
And then I started
hearing her voice.

132
00:12:23.599 --> 00:12:27.433
And I can hear somebody
whispering to me.

133
00:12:27.433 --> 00:12:28.433
- Whispering what?

134
00:12:28.433 --> 00:12:31.432
- One word. and only one.

135
00:12:31.465 --> 00:12:33.632
I hear it every time I go to
sleep and every time I wake up.

136
00:12:33.698 --> 00:12:36.231
and I only wake up
from nightmares.

137
00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:37.231
- What word?

138
00:12:40.264 --> 00:12:41.464
- Bardo.

139
00:12:46.431 --> 00:12:49.896
Uh. I--I. uh--

140
00:12:49.963 --> 00:12:51.296
I was on the phone the other day
and I was writing down

141
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.630
a client's number.

142
00:12:52.696 --> 00:12:55.596
But instead of the number.
I wrote that.

143
00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:02.429
- Scott. do you know
what bardo is?

144
00:13:02.495 --> 00:13:03.962
- A state between
life and death.

145
00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:05.129
- You and I.
we're both seeing her.

146
00:13:05.194 --> 00:13:07.194
We're both speaking
the same word.

147
00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:08.429
It's not just a dream.

148
00:13:08.495 --> 00:13:10.529
Allison is caught between
life and death.

149
00:13:10.595 --> 00:13:12.628
- It's not that simple.

150
00:13:12.694 --> 00:13:13.994
Bardo is a Tibetan word.

151
00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:15.528
It's a means of
interpreting death

152
00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:16.961
and the movements
of consciousness

153
00:13:17.028 --> 00:13:19.293
between physical states
of being.

154
00:13:19.428 --> 00:13:21.561
It's just a word.

155
00:13:21.628 --> 00:13:22.893
It's a concept.

156
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.560
- Well. that fucking concept
is waking me up

157
00:13:24.627 --> 00:13:26.127
in the middle of the night
in a cold sweat.

158
00:13:26.193 --> 00:13:30.059
telling me my daughter
is still out there!

159
00:13:30.126 --> 00:13:31.593
- She can't be.

160
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.592
I mean. she--
she died in my arms.

161
00:13:34.659 --> 00:13:37.192
I felt her slip away from me.

162
00:13:37.259 --> 00:13:38.526
- I know we all die.

163
00:13:38.592 --> 00:13:41.759
I'm not pretending to know
what happens next.

164
00:13:41.826 --> 00:13:44.758
But if there was something
after this life. some next step.

165
00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:46.426
I don't think she made it.

166
00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:50.058
And I think she's trying to
tell us she never crossed over.

167
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:53.990
- It's been 15 years.

168
00:13:54.057 --> 00:13:57.425
- Let's say we accept all this.

169
00:13:57.458 --> 00:13:59.557
What can we actually do to help?

170
00:13:59.624 --> 00:14:02.524
- There's a--a--
a ritual of some kind.

171
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.289
I know a few details.

172
00:14:04.424 --> 00:14:07.123
I got a feeling the real answers
are in Beacon Hills.

173
00:14:10.423 --> 00:14:11.556
- OK.

174
00:14:11.623 --> 00:14:13.856
What else can you say
for certain?

175
00:14:13.923 --> 00:14:16.055
- It has to be done by
the next full moon.

176
00:14:16.122 --> 00:14:18.988
And if it's not.
we don't get another chance.

177
00:14:20.488 --> 00:14:21.722
- I'm not sure.

178
00:14:21.788 --> 00:14:25.121
And I'll admit.
I'm a little scared.

179
00:14:25.187 --> 00:14:27.588
We're talking about
dangerous rituals.

180
00:14:27.655 --> 00:14:29.654
thousands of years old.

181
00:14:29.721 --> 00:14:31.254
There are going to
be repercussions.

182
00:14:31.321 --> 00:14:34.154
- So can somebody
just say one thing?

183
00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.253
Are we doing this or not?

184
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.853
- Well. the message
was for you. Scott.

185
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.320
It's yours to answer.

186
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:41.421
- It's more than a message.

187
00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:50.085
This is the sword
that killed her.

188
00:14:50.152 --> 00:14:52.420
Her blood

189
00:14:52.486 --> 00:14:55.419
stained the blade.

190
00:14:55.485 --> 00:14:57.719
- I haven't been to Beacon Hills
in a long time.

191
00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:03.151
- None of us have.

192
00:15:03.218 --> 00:15:05.818
But if you drive out tomorrow.
I can meet you there

193
00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:08.684
by afternoon.

194
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:10.950
- We're gonna need more help.

195
00:15:11.017 --> 00:15:12.418
- And more answers.

196
00:15:15.183 --> 00:15:18.216
- Yeah. I'm gonna need to find
some old friends.

197
00:15:20.617 --> 00:15:23.517
- Sound energy--
I'm speaking specifically

198
00:15:23.583 --> 00:15:26.149
of the sounds that fill
our acoustic environment.

199
00:15:26.216 --> 00:15:28.315
Our current ability to harness
those sounds.

200
00:15:28.416 --> 00:15:31.115
as not only
a renewable energy source.

201
00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:34.081
but as a green sustainable
electric energy.

202
00:15:34.148 --> 00:15:36.416
- Lydia. I hate to
interrupt you. especially

203
00:15:36.449 --> 00:15:38.981
since you're going full throttle
with this tech shit

204
00:15:39.048 --> 00:15:40.448
that none of us really seem
to understand.

205
00:15:40.515 --> 00:15:42.681
- Thanks for the input. Rick.
and for not interrupting.

206
00:15:42.748 --> 00:15:45.047
- Yeah. Lyd. listen--
- Continuing on.

207
00:15:45.114 --> 00:15:47.547
research into energy harvesting.

208
00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:48.914
up until now--

209
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.014
- Lydia. I just have one tiny.
little question.

210
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.780
Lyd--
- Stop calling me Lyd.

211
00:15:52.847 --> 00:15:54.414
- Lydia!
- Rick.

212
00:15:54.414 --> 00:15:55.813
For someone who hates
to interrupt.

213
00:15:55.879 --> 00:15:58.113
you seem oddly compelled
to keep doing it.

214
00:15:58.179 --> 00:16:01.779
- Look. all I want to know is.
who's Allison?

215
00:16:18.777 --> 00:16:20.911
Lyd.

216
00:18:45.664 --> 00:18:48.198
- Um. hey. Sheriff?

217
00:18:48.263 --> 00:18:49.531
I really hate to bother you.

218
00:18:49.598 --> 00:18:51.431
I just got a phone call
from Deputy Parrish.

219
00:18:51.498 --> 00:18:55.398
He wants to talk to our...
consultant.

220
00:18:55.464 --> 00:18:57.697
- Another incident
at the auto shop?

221
00:18:57.763 --> 00:18:59.830
- His son definitely has

222
00:18:59.897 --> 00:19:01.930
an unhealthy fixation
on that Jeep.

223
00:19:03.129 --> 00:19:04.196
- Do you want me to tell him?

224
00:19:04.262 --> 00:19:07.262
- Nah.
He better hear it from me.

225
00:19:14.496 --> 00:19:16.161
- You were right.

226
00:19:16.228 --> 00:19:17.628
It wasn't gasoline.

227
00:19:17.695 --> 00:19:19.995
Whoever set this fire used
a chemical accelerant.

228
00:19:20.061 --> 00:19:21.795
- Four fires in two weeks.

229
00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:23.761
That's a serial arsonist.

230
00:19:23.828 --> 00:19:25.495
Do I need to call in the FBI?

231
00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:28.094
- Well. maybe you should be
calling your son.

232
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.694
Trust me. right now Stiles
has his own fires

233
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.394
to put out.

234
00:19:31.394 --> 00:19:32.894
I think we can handle
one arsonist.

235
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.560
- The only thing I'd say is.
this one seems to have a plan.

236
00:19:41.826 --> 00:19:43.959
You need to get that?

237
00:19:44.026 --> 00:19:46.559
- Yeah.
- No.

238
00:19:46.626 --> 00:19:48.626
- It--it can--it can wait.

239
00:19:48.693 --> 00:19:49.825
- Mm-hmm.

240
00:19:53.558 --> 00:19:56.291
- You want me to answer it?
- No.

241
00:19:56.392 --> 00:19:59.525
- Why do I have a feeling
that that's about me?

242
00:19:59.592 --> 00:20:01.458
Or maybe my son?

243
00:20:03.191 --> 00:20:05.323
He still seems pretty intent
on leaving high school

244
00:20:05.391 --> 00:20:07.424
with a grand theft auto charge.

245
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.491
- He took the Jeep again.
didn't he?

246
00:20:11.557 --> 00:20:14.256
- Why the hell does he keep
taking the Jeep?

247
00:20:14.323 --> 00:20:15.790
- Because he knows I hate it.

248
00:20:34.054 --> 00:20:36.054
- What the--

249
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.020
I'm not paying for those.

250
00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:45.987
- Oh. yes. you are.

251
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.387
- What's up. guys?

252
00:21:49.682 --> 00:21:51.181
- I--I can't--

253
00:21:51.247 --> 00:21:52.415
I can't take your pain.

254
00:21:52.482 --> 00:21:55.281
- That's because
it doesn't hurt.

255
00:22:14.845 --> 00:22:17.512
- Hey. thanks for coming
so fast.

256
00:22:17.579 --> 00:22:18.645
Yeah.

257
00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:20.445
Hey.

258
00:22:31.078 --> 00:22:34.578
- Do you really think
all this is true?

259
00:22:34.644 --> 00:22:37.010
Allison being stuck.

260
00:22:37.077 --> 00:22:40.043
unable to cross over?

261
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.510
- I don't know.

262
00:22:43.877 --> 00:22:47.676
But if being here and doing
this thing actually helps her.

263
00:22:47.742 --> 00:22:50.109
and no one else gets hurt.

264
00:22:50.176 --> 00:22:53.376
I'm up for trying.

265
00:22:53.442 --> 00:22:55.175
- OK.

266
00:22:55.241 --> 00:22:57.642
Then let's try.

267
00:23:03.741 --> 00:23:08.107
We need a handful of earth from
the ground where Allison died.

268
00:23:08.174 --> 00:23:10.074
- OK.
- OK.

269
00:24:03.802 --> 00:24:04.735
What's next?

270
00:24:19.468 --> 00:24:20.768
- Anybody mind if
we close this thing?

271
00:24:20.834 --> 00:24:21.768
- Yeah.

272
00:24:24.967 --> 00:24:27.501
Does your. uh.

273
00:24:27.568 --> 00:24:30.533
mom know that you're here?

274
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.900
- Does she know that
you're here?

275
00:24:31.967 --> 00:24:33.166
- No.

276
00:24:33.232 --> 00:24:35.367
And I kind of want to
keep it that way.

277
00:24:35.367 --> 00:24:36.467
- Yeah. me too.

278
00:24:38.966 --> 00:24:40.232
- All right.

279
00:24:40.367 --> 00:24:41.367
Lydia. we've got the earth
where she died.

280
00:24:41.432 --> 00:24:42.599
the weapon that took her life.

281
00:24:42.666 --> 00:24:44.832
According to you.
that's steps one and two.

282
00:24:44.899 --> 00:24:46.366
What is next?

283
00:24:46.366 --> 00:24:51.898
- I was. uh. hoping you could
help me figure that out.

284
00:24:51.965 --> 00:24:54.165
I mean. to be honest.
I'm a little out of practice

285
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:56.398
with all of this.

286
00:24:56.465 --> 00:24:58.830
- You still scream like
a banshee. right?

287
00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:01.197
- Not quite like I used to.

288
00:25:01.264 --> 00:25:02.398
It's just like a muscle.

289
00:25:02.465 --> 00:25:05.464
You stop using it.
and it atrophies.

290
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.597
- Why did you stop
using your power?

291
00:25:07.664 --> 00:25:09.397
- Stiles.

292
00:25:09.464 --> 00:25:12.229
Obviously it has something
to do with Stiles.

293
00:25:14.229 --> 00:25:15.363
- Why is Jackson here?

294
00:25:17.896 --> 00:25:20.128
What are you doing?

295
00:25:20.195 --> 00:25:22.995
- Well. firstly.
Jackson prefers not

296
00:25:23.062 --> 00:25:25.695
to be talked about
like he's not in the room.

297
00:25:25.762 --> 00:25:30.161
Second. well. Lydia called.
begging me to help. as usual.

298
00:25:30.227 --> 00:25:32.362
And I said. OK.

299
00:25:32.362 --> 00:25:34.227
so long as she promised
never to tell Ethan.

300
00:25:34.362 --> 00:25:35.827
because I promised Ethan
that I would never

301
00:25:35.894 --> 00:25:38.194
come back to this nightmare
hellscape of a town.

302
00:25:38.261 --> 00:25:40.260
- Thank you.

303
00:25:40.361 --> 00:25:42.494
- Oh. I love these games.

304
00:25:44.993 --> 00:25:46.560
- This isn't a game.

305
00:25:46.626 --> 00:25:50.660
- I have claws that
drip paralytic venom.

306
00:25:50.726 --> 00:25:52.526
and a tail that'll
snap your neck.

307
00:25:52.593 --> 00:25:55.192
So take your hand
off of me. old man.

308
00:26:20.857 --> 00:26:21.990
Oh.

309
00:26:34.922 --> 00:26:36.356
It's a tree.

310
00:26:36.422 --> 00:26:37.988
- It's not just a tree.

311
00:26:38.055 --> 00:26:39.988
- It's the Sacred Grove.

312
00:26:40.055 --> 00:26:43.588
- The ancients Druids
call it a nemeton.

313
00:26:43.655 --> 00:26:45.821
Well. it looks like a tree.

314
00:27:13.985 --> 00:27:15.085
- All right.

315
00:27:15.152 --> 00:27:16.885
Can we just--

316
00:27:16.952 --> 00:27:18.418
can we just stop
before either of us

317
00:27:18.485 --> 00:27:19.918
does anything
completely embarrassing?

318
00:27:19.985 --> 00:27:23.385
- I think that qualifies
as pretty embarrassing.

319
00:27:23.452 --> 00:27:24.751
- It was coming loose anyway.

320
00:27:24.817 --> 00:27:26.217
- Are you gonna punish me
or not?

321
00:27:26.352 --> 00:27:28.351
Cause otherwise.
I'll just go to my room.

322
00:27:28.384 --> 00:27:30.216
- Eli. I don't--
I don't want to punish you.

323
00:27:30.351 --> 00:27:32.484
I'd like to maybe understand
what you think you were doing.

324
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:34.551
- I needed a ride to meet
my friends after the game.

325
00:27:34.617 --> 00:27:36.250
What is wrong with that?

326
00:27:36.351 --> 00:27:37.816
- You're 15.
you don't have a license.

327
00:27:37.883 --> 00:27:39.150
and it's called
breaking the law.

328
00:27:39.216 --> 00:27:41.016
- You never broke the law?

329
00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:42.416
- OK. You know what?

330
00:27:42.483 --> 00:27:43.816
If this is about
the other thing.

331
00:27:43.883 --> 00:27:45.182
then let's talk about
the other thing.

332
00:27:45.249 --> 00:27:46.583
- I don't want to talk to you
about anything.

333
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:47.915
- I wouldn't push it
if it wasn't a thing.

334
00:27:47.982 --> 00:27:49.715
But we both know
it's not just anything.

335
00:27:49.782 --> 00:27:51.449
and now it's
definitely something.

336
00:27:51.515 --> 00:27:53.049
- I don't even know what
you're talking about.

337
00:27:53.115 --> 00:27:54.349
Are you listening to yourself?

338
00:27:54.382 --> 00:27:55.549
You sound drunk.

339
00:27:55.615 --> 00:27:57.714
- I can't get drunk.
You know that.

340
00:27:57.781 --> 00:27:59.881
- It's not my problem.
- Eli. it's a thing!

341
00:27:59.948 --> 00:28:01.214
OK. to you. not me.

342
00:28:01.349 --> 00:28:02.248
- I can teach you.

343
00:28:02.348 --> 00:28:03.481
- What if I don't want to learn?

344
00:28:03.548 --> 00:28:04.548
- Well. you're gonna
have to learn.

345
00:28:04.614 --> 00:28:06.047
It's who you are.
You're a Hale.

346
00:28:06.113 --> 00:28:07.514
- I'll change my name.

347
00:28:07.581 --> 00:28:09.080
- That won't change the fact
that you're a werewolf!

348
00:28:09.147 --> 00:28:10.514
- And what if I'm not?

349
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.880
Maybe that's why
I can't turn into one?

350
00:28:14.947 --> 00:28:17.347
You know. what if I'm
the first ever Hale

351
00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.912
not to turn into a werewolf?

352
00:28:22.979 --> 00:28:24.246
- To be honest.

353
00:28:24.346 --> 00:28:26.412
it would probably make
life a little easier.

354
00:28:26.479 --> 00:28:28.911
- Yeah. for me?

355
00:28:28.978 --> 00:28:30.011
Or you?

356
00:28:45.378 --> 00:28:46.977
- Definitely me.

357
00:29:21.641 --> 00:29:23.206
- You're trespassing.

358
00:29:26.073 --> 00:29:27.073
- You're naked.

359
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.206
- You're not.

360
00:29:37.406 --> 00:29:39.705
- Better?

361
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.771
- Eli. come on out.

362
00:29:57.838 --> 00:30:01.003
I was thinking we could
practice before the game.

363
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.338
You know. basketball was
really always more my thing.

364
00:30:03.403 --> 00:30:05.970
But. uh. I think
I'm getting better.

365
00:30:06.037 --> 00:30:08.503
Maybe you can show me
some tricks?

366
00:30:21.001 --> 00:30:22.101
Or maybe not.

367
00:30:55.732 --> 00:30:57.565
- You're giving me
that look again.

368
00:30:57.632 --> 00:30:59.565
- What look?
- The look.

369
00:30:59.632 --> 00:31:00.732
- What are you talking about?
There's no look.

370
00:31:00.798 --> 00:31:02.632
- There's a look.
- What look?

371
00:31:02.698 --> 00:31:05.764
- The relationship look.

372
00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:08.398
- Oh.
- Yeah. that look.

373
00:31:08.465 --> 00:31:10.431
- Did I say anything?

374
00:31:10.497 --> 00:31:13.431
- You said it with a look.

375
00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:15.364
And I'm not changing my mind.

376
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:17.163
- And I'm not asking you to.

377
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.230
- OK.

378
00:31:20.063 --> 00:31:21.063
But your look is.

379
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.663
- All right.

380
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.330
But. since we're
talking about it--

381
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.829
Sorry.

382
00:31:36.662 --> 00:31:38.028
I got to go.

383
00:31:50.927 --> 00:31:52.428
- What are you doing here?

384
00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:53.593
- Looking for answers.

385
00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.827
And I'm wondering if you've made
any recent trips to Japan.

386
00:32:17.758 --> 00:32:20.190
- Oh. for the love of God.
Come on.

387
00:32:28.857 --> 00:32:30.757
- Oh! I missed you!

388
00:32:30.824 --> 00:32:32.390
- I missed you too.
- No. you didn't.

389
00:32:32.457 --> 00:32:33.690
- OK. I wanted to.

390
00:32:33.757 --> 00:32:35.324
- Well. that I can believe.

391
00:32:36.756 --> 00:32:38.856
- Hi.
- Hi.

392
00:32:42.623 --> 00:32:44.155
- It's good to see you.

393
00:32:44.222 --> 00:32:46.623
- It's kind of awkward
to see you.

394
00:32:46.688 --> 00:32:48.456
- I know.

395
00:32:48.522 --> 00:32:49.988
- OK!

396
00:32:50.055 --> 00:32:52.187
Let's go find a tree
in the woods.

397
00:33:01.354 --> 00:33:02.787
Come on.

398
00:33:02.854 --> 00:33:04.321
You said we need to find
this thing by nightfall.

399
00:33:10.953 --> 00:33:14.420
- I haven't been to Japan
in years.

400
00:33:14.486 --> 00:33:15.686
- Are you sure about that?

401
00:33:15.753 --> 00:33:17.219
- Positive.

402
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.819
How long has it been since
you were in Beacon Hills?

403
00:33:19.885 --> 00:33:21.052
Because I seem to remember
you telling us that

404
00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:22.985
you were going to stay
in Los Angeles.

405
00:33:23.052 --> 00:33:25.752
- I was. but I wanted to ask you
another question.

406
00:33:25.819 --> 00:33:30.385
And it. um. it might
sound a little strange.

407
00:33:30.452 --> 00:33:34.218
You walk into a room
that contains a match.

408
00:33:34.319 --> 00:33:38.351
a kerosene lamp.
a candle. and a fireplace.

409
00:33:38.418 --> 00:33:40.017
What would you light first?

410
00:33:40.083 --> 00:33:41.217
- The match.

411
00:33:43.183 --> 00:33:45.717
You came all this way to
Beacon Hills to ask me that?

412
00:33:45.783 --> 00:33:48.450
- I do have another question.

413
00:33:48.517 --> 00:33:50.982
What has to be broken
before it can be used?

414
00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:53.682
- An egg.

415
00:33:53.749 --> 00:33:56.317
- I'm tall when I'm young.

416
00:33:56.382 --> 00:33:58.649
and I'm short when I'm old.

417
00:33:58.716 --> 00:34:02.316
What am I?
- A candle.

418
00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:04.582
Do you want to talk
about that bullet.

419
00:34:04.648 --> 00:34:06.848
or you want to keep
asking me children's riddles?

420
00:34:06.915 --> 00:34:08.715
- What month of the year
has 28 days?

421
00:34:08.781 --> 00:34:11.315
- All of them.

422
00:34:11.315 --> 00:34:12.715
- What has many keys--

423
00:34:12.781 --> 00:34:14.648
- Stop.

424
00:34:14.714 --> 00:34:16.381
Stop talking.

425
00:34:16.448 --> 00:34:19.814
- What has many keys
yet opens no locks?

426
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.146
- A piano.

427
00:34:21.213 --> 00:34:23.079
- What has many teeth
but cannot bite?

428
00:34:23.146 --> 00:34:24.780
- A comb.

429
00:34:29.446 --> 00:34:31.713
- What is always in front of you
but can never be seen?

430
00:34:31.779 --> 00:34:34.178
- The future.

431
00:34:34.313 --> 00:34:36.713
- The more of this there is.
the less you can see.

432
00:34:36.778 --> 00:34:39.778
What is it?

433
00:34:39.845 --> 00:34:42.312
- Darkness. you motherfucker!

434
00:35:06.576 --> 00:35:07.643
- It's me.

435
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.310
Um. hey. we're still looking.

436
00:35:09.376 --> 00:35:13.209
Just getting a little worried
about meeting up on time.

437
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:17.309
So just give me a call
or text. anything.

438
00:35:19.542 --> 00:35:21.774
Mm.

439
00:35:21.841 --> 00:35:23.475
OK.

440
00:35:28.808 --> 00:35:30.173
Ah!

441
00:35:30.308 --> 00:35:31.441
It's this way.

442
00:35:31.508 --> 00:35:32.641
It's this way.

443
00:35:38.973 --> 00:35:42.039
- What is it?

444
00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:43.340
- Someone's following us.

445
00:35:46.706 --> 00:35:49.406
They've been following us
pretty much the whole time.

446
00:35:49.472 --> 00:35:51.105
- Who?

447
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:55.071
- Here. come here!

448
00:35:55.138 --> 00:35:56.306
- Wait. wait.
I wasn't doing anything!

449
00:35:56.306 --> 00:35:57.372
Sorry!

450
00:35:57.439 --> 00:35:58.671
Uh.

451
00:35:58.738 --> 00:36:00.671
- It is you.

452
00:36:00.738 --> 00:36:03.004
- Eli. Derek's son.

453
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.538
- Wow. you've gotten really big.

454
00:36:04.605 --> 00:36:06.104
- Yeah. It's probably
because I was only three

455
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.770
the last time you saw me.

456
00:36:07.837 --> 00:36:09.371
- What are you doing out here?

457
00:36:09.437 --> 00:36:11.404
- I was kind of wondering what
you guys were doing out here.

458
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.637
- Hiking.

459
00:36:12.704 --> 00:36:13.870
Can't you tell?

460
00:36:13.937 --> 00:36:15.136
It's a really nice night
for hiking.

461
00:36:15.203 --> 00:36:16.537
- I know what
you're looking for.

462
00:36:16.604 --> 00:36:17.836
The tree. right?

463
00:36:17.903 --> 00:36:19.203
That huge stump's that's
like 20-feet wide?

464
00:36:19.304 --> 00:36:20.936
- You know how to find it?

465
00:36:21.003 --> 00:36:22.503
- Kind of.

466
00:36:22.569 --> 00:36:23.703
I sleepwalk.

467
00:36:23.769 --> 00:36:25.135
I don't know why.

468
00:36:25.202 --> 00:36:26.835
But I've just been doing it
for the last few months.

469
00:36:26.902 --> 00:36:28.702
- I used to wake up
in the woods too.

470
00:36:28.768 --> 00:36:30.835
- After you were bit
by Peter. right?

471
00:36:30.902 --> 00:36:32.568
- Yeah. your dad tell you
a few stories?

472
00:36:32.635 --> 00:36:33.802
- Yeah. all of 'em.

473
00:36:33.868 --> 00:36:35.702
- What about the tree?

474
00:36:35.768 --> 00:36:36.967
- It's not far from here.

475
00:36:37.034 --> 00:36:38.134
- I knew we were going
the right way.

476
00:36:38.201 --> 00:36:39.302
- No. you were going
the wrong way.

477
00:36:39.368 --> 00:36:41.134
It's that way.
- We were circling back.

478
00:36:41.201 --> 00:36:42.734
- Hm.
- Thank you.

479
00:36:42.801 --> 00:36:43.801
- Well. I can help you find it.

480
00:36:43.867 --> 00:36:45.867
- Got it.
- Hey. come on.

481
00:36:52.566 --> 00:36:54.600
- What are you doing?

482
00:37:00.832 --> 00:37:03.466
- So aren't you the screamer?

483
00:37:03.532 --> 00:37:04.799
- Banshee.

484
00:37:04.865 --> 00:37:06.332
- Yeah. but banshees scream.
right?

485
00:37:06.399 --> 00:37:09.765
- Well. they wail if you want
to get technical. but yes.

486
00:37:09.832 --> 00:37:11.164
- So how loud can you scream?

487
00:37:11.299 --> 00:37:12.998
Loud enough to create a burst
of acoustic energy

488
00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:15.098
that could crush your skull.

489
00:37:15.164 --> 00:37:17.498
- Good to know.

490
00:37:17.564 --> 00:37:19.898
- There it is.

491
00:37:19.964 --> 00:37:22.331
OK. OK.

492
00:37:23.997 --> 00:37:25.331
So what should we do
about Argent?

493
00:37:25.398 --> 00:37:28.763
- Uh. I mean. I'm never
gonna get a signal now.

494
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.063
Even if he's texting me.
I wouldn't know.

495
00:37:30.129 --> 00:37:31.663
- Well. we're going to
have to do this now.

496
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:32.896
We can't wait for him.

497
00:37:32.962 --> 00:37:34.196
- It's his daughter.

498
00:37:34.297 --> 00:37:35.996
- You said it has to be tonight.

499
00:37:36.062 --> 00:37:37.996
He would want us to do this
without him.

500
00:37:40.729 --> 00:37:42.362
Don't you have something to do?

501
00:37:42.429 --> 00:37:43.496
- Yeah.

502
00:37:43.562 --> 00:37:44.995
Yeah. I have a lacrosse game
to play.

503
00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:46.462
Well. more like a lacrosse
game to show up to

504
00:37:46.529 --> 00:37:49.296
since I. like.
I never get to play.

505
00:37:51.928 --> 00:37:53.428
Oh! You want me to leave?

506
00:37:53.495 --> 00:37:55.595
OK. Uh. I got it.

507
00:37:55.661 --> 00:37:57.528
OK. well. I'll tell my dad
that I saw you guys?

508
00:37:57.595 --> 00:37:59.594
- No. don't.

509
00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.760
Don't tell him anything.

510
00:38:00.827 --> 00:38:04.193
This is kind of--
- Personal.

511
00:38:04.294 --> 00:38:05.794
- All right. Don't worry.

512
00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.926
I won't say anything.

513
00:38:18.792 --> 00:38:19.825
- All right.

514
00:38:19.892 --> 00:38:21.492
Now what?

515
00:38:23.992 --> 00:38:25.658
- OK.

516
00:38:29.924 --> 00:38:32.791
Why are you looking at me?

517
00:38:32.857 --> 00:38:34.424
I didn't write the instructions.

518
00:38:34.491 --> 00:38:35.824
- Yeah. you did.

519
00:38:35.891 --> 00:38:37.324
You literally wrote
the instructions.

520
00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:39.123
Okay. you know what I mean.

521
00:38:47.656 --> 00:38:48.923
- Do you feel that?

522
00:38:48.989 --> 00:38:50.656
Yeah.

523
00:39:10.554 --> 00:39:12.987
- What the hell?

524
00:39:13.053 --> 00:39:14.787
Uh...

525
00:39:41.951 --> 00:39:43.018
- OK.

526
00:39:43.085 --> 00:39:44.418
That was fun.

527
00:39:44.485 --> 00:39:46.017
Um. you guys want to go
get something to eat now?

528
00:39:56.717 --> 00:39:59.016
- I know.

529
00:40:17.482 --> 00:40:19.047
- Hey. guys.

530
00:40:44.945 --> 00:40:46.179
It's Allison.

531
00:40:54.044 --> 00:40:56.078
She's alive.

532
00:41:05.943 --> 00:41:07.810
This can't be real.

533
00:41:07.877 --> 00:41:08.943
It can't be her.

534
00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:10.177
She was cremated.

535
00:41:10.277 --> 00:41:11.510
- She looks pretty
un-cremated to me.

536
00:41:11.577 --> 00:41:12.943
- She's not just un-cremated.

537
00:41:13.009 --> 00:41:15.277
She's literally been
reconstituted out of thin air.

538
00:41:15.277 --> 00:41:18.142
- So that wasn't in
the instructions?

539
00:41:20.742 --> 00:41:22.442
I got a question.

540
00:41:22.509 --> 00:41:24.542
What do we do when she wakes up?

541
00:41:24.609 --> 00:41:26.276
- If she wakes up.

542
00:41:31.141 --> 00:41:33.575
We need some help.

543
00:41:35.074 --> 00:41:36.308
- Mom. we got a problem.

544
00:41:40.174 --> 00:41:43.140
- She looks just like Allison.

545
00:41:43.274 --> 00:41:46.973
Why. Scott. does she look
exactly like Allison?

546
00:41:47.039 --> 00:41:48.607
- You really want to know?

547
00:41:48.674 --> 00:41:50.906
- Just get her inside.

548
00:41:50.973 --> 00:41:52.639
OK.

549
00:42:37.635 --> 00:42:41.902
- Chaos!

550
00:42:41.969 --> 00:42:46.001
Strife!

551
00:42:46.068 --> 00:42:48.868
Pain!

552
00:42:54.634 --> 00:42:55.733
- Listen up!

553
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.167
Tonight's game
is not just a game.

554
00:42:59.268 --> 00:43:01.533
This is a preamble
to what comes tomorrow.

555
00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.633
an overture to a symphony
of victory!

556
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.333
This tournament
is everything I've dreamed of

557
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.267
my entire career
as a lacrosse coach.

558
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.899
And that trophy is
going right here. boys.

559
00:43:13.966 --> 00:43:16.898
And I know none of you
will ruin it for me

560
00:43:16.965 --> 00:43:19.266
by losing this game tonight!

561
00:43:19.266 --> 00:43:20.332
Am I right?

562
00:43:20.399 --> 00:43:22.798
all: Yes. Coach!

563
00:43:22.865 --> 00:43:23.931
- Oh.

564
00:43:23.998 --> 00:43:24.998
It's just you.

565
00:43:25.065 --> 00:43:26.831
- Just me.

566
00:43:26.898 --> 00:43:28.764
But I'm here. with him.

567
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.330
- We can talk about it later.

568
00:43:34.397 --> 00:43:35.564
I came to watch you play.

569
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:36.864
- Well. prepare for
disappointment.

570
00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:40.896
'cause if you didn't notice.
I never play.

571
00:43:40.963 --> 00:43:43.929
- I noticed. and I'm going to
talk to your coach about it.

572
00:43:43.996 --> 00:43:45.264
- Oh. God. no! No. no!

573
00:43:45.296 --> 00:43:48.429
- Hey. Coach. can I have a word?
- Don't do that.

574
00:43:48.496 --> 00:43:51.995
- Eli.
you probably got the feeling

575
00:43:52.062 --> 00:43:54.396
that I'm not actually here
to watch your game.

576
00:43:54.462 --> 00:43:56.628
Yeah?
- Kinda.

577
00:43:56.695 --> 00:44:00.362
- And that maybe I'm here to
give my good friend. your dad.

578
00:44:00.428 --> 00:44:02.495
just a little support as
he deals with

579
00:44:02.562 --> 00:44:05.262
his somewhat delinquent son.

580
00:44:05.295 --> 00:44:06.262
- Maybe.

581
00:44:06.328 --> 00:44:07.927
- But I'm not.

582
00:44:07.994 --> 00:44:09.094
I'm here to warn you.

583
00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.361
You steal that Jeep again.

584
00:44:10.427 --> 00:44:12.294
I'm going to haul your ass
into a jail cell.

585
00:44:12.361 --> 00:44:13.793
have you tried as an adult.

586
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.860
and watch you get sent
to the state penitentiary

587
00:44:15.926 --> 00:44:18.326
for a minimum of 90 days.

588
00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.326
- Did he tell you to scare me?

589
00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.626
- Maybe.

590
00:44:24.693 --> 00:44:26.559
Good luck with the game. Eli.

591
00:44:26.625 --> 00:44:27.925
Yeah.

592
00:44:34.792 --> 00:44:36.359
What do you think about my son
getting a little playing time

593
00:44:36.425 --> 00:44:38.425
tonight?
- I think that's a great idea.

594
00:44:38.491 --> 00:44:39.624
- You don't know who my son is.
do you?

595
00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:41.158
- I don't know who you are.

596
00:44:41.258 --> 00:44:44.890
But you look pretty athletic.

597
00:44:44.957 --> 00:44:47.723
so I'm guessing your son is too.

598
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.823
- That's my son.

599
00:44:52.257 --> 00:44:53.423
- I was wrong.

600
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.122
- Just give him five minutes
in the game.

601
00:44:55.257 --> 00:44:56.257
Let him prove himself.

602
00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:57.657
- Three minutes
if we're winning.

603
00:44:57.723 --> 00:44:59.290
- Five minutes.
- OK.

604
00:44:59.357 --> 00:45:00.622
You know what?
You drive a tough bargain.

605
00:45:00.689 --> 00:45:03.356
Three it is!
- Coach.

606
00:45:03.422 --> 00:45:05.456
- Four minutes!

607
00:45:05.522 --> 00:45:07.988
Not a second longer.

608
00:45:12.088 --> 00:45:14.588
What about four and 1/2?

609
00:45:16.955 --> 00:45:18.288
- I checked her vitals.

610
00:45:18.355 --> 00:45:21.154
Everything's normal.
at least normal for a woman

611
00:45:21.255 --> 00:45:24.255
who's been dead for 15 years.

612
00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:25.554
- Maybe we should cut her open

613
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.454
and then see
if she's normal inside.

614
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.254
- Not exactly how medical
treatment works.

615
00:45:29.287 --> 00:45:30.554
But thanks for the suggestion.

616
00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:31.853
- How do we know she's OK?

617
00:45:31.919 --> 00:45:35.553
I mean. not just physically
but mentally?

618
00:45:35.619 --> 00:45:37.419
- How do we know
this is Allison?

619
00:45:37.486 --> 00:45:39.253
Hm? Really Allison?

620
00:45:39.253 --> 00:45:41.152
- We don't.

621
00:45:41.253 --> 00:45:43.486
This wasn't exactly part
of the plan.

622
00:45:43.553 --> 00:45:47.585
- Maybe our first step is
simply talking with her.

623
00:45:47.652 --> 00:45:50.285
Since she doesn't appear
to be injured.

624
00:45:50.352 --> 00:45:53.518
we're probably OK
to try waking her up.

625
00:45:53.585 --> 00:45:56.484
- Mom?
- Yeah.

626
00:45:56.551 --> 00:45:58.517
I think she's awake.

627
00:46:19.982 --> 00:46:22.415
- Our sons are trained
to be soldiers.

628
00:46:22.482 --> 00:46:26.482
daughters to be leaders.

629
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:29.148
- Shapeshifter. lycan.

630
00:46:29.249 --> 00:46:32.748
werewolf.

631
00:46:32.814 --> 00:46:35.913
to me it's just
another dumb animal.

632
00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:57.246
- Allison.

633
00:46:57.279 --> 00:46:59.945
Allison.

634
00:47:00.011 --> 00:47:02.011
Allison?

635
00:47:02.078 --> 00:47:03.711
- Where the hell does
she think she's going?

636
00:47:03.778 --> 00:47:05.278
- She's probably
slightly confused.

637
00:47:05.345 --> 00:47:06.578
- Supposed to be slightly dead.

638
00:47:06.645 --> 00:47:08.977
- Split up.
If you find her. yell.

639
00:47:09.844 --> 00:47:11.545
OK.

640
00:47:18.044 --> 00:47:19.143
- Got her!

641
00:47:21.076 --> 00:47:22.644
Ah.

642
00:47:22.709 --> 00:47:24.244
- Hey. Allison!

643
00:47:24.277 --> 00:47:25.576
You OK?

644
00:47:25.643 --> 00:47:26.976
- Not me. man.

645
00:47:44.242 --> 00:47:45.674
- Shit.

646
00:47:47.141 --> 00:47:48.707
Hey. Allison. wait!

647
00:47:54.241 --> 00:47:55.840
Whoa!

648
00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.240
Who are you?

649
00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.505
- It's me. It's Scott.

650
00:48:13.572 --> 00:48:15.505
- Scott who?

651
00:48:15.572 --> 00:48:18.239
- McCall.

652
00:48:18.239 --> 00:48:19.904
- Where's the alpha?

653
00:48:19.971 --> 00:48:20.738
- You mean?

654
00:48:20.804 --> 00:48:23.138
- Where's Derek Hale?

655
00:48:54.601 --> 00:48:56.468
- Wait!

656
00:48:58.401 --> 00:49:02.235
- Hey.
Allison. she's alive.

657
00:49:02.301 --> 00:49:03.535
She's back.

658
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.067
- She's not the only one.

659
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.033
- Levchenko.
did you call the power company?

660
00:49:15.099 --> 00:49:16.334
- I just did.

661
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.899
They said everything
is fine on their end.

662
00:49:17.966 --> 00:49:18.866
- Huh.
- Might be an

663
00:49:18.933 --> 00:49:20.433
electrical issue here.

664
00:49:20.499 --> 00:49:21.998
- Sheriff.
we got another problem

665
00:49:22.065 --> 00:49:23.798
that you might want to handle
first.

666
00:49:23.865 --> 00:49:30.432
- If it's another fire.
I don't want to hear about it.

667
00:49:30.498 --> 00:49:32.465
Of course I want
to hear about it!

668
00:49:32.532 --> 00:49:35.131
Get the hell in here.
both of you!

669
00:49:35.232 --> 00:49:37.631
- 20 minutes ago. two hikers
were headed down the trails

670
00:49:37.697 --> 00:49:39.431
and they spotted smoke.

671
00:49:39.497 --> 00:49:40.864
- We've got another witness
who said

672
00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:42.264
they passed by someone
wearing a heavy black coat.

673
00:49:42.331 --> 00:49:44.564
but couldn't see his face
because of a hood.

674
00:49:44.631 --> 00:49:45.631
- OK.

675
00:49:45.697 --> 00:49:46.796
Levchenko. you're with me.

676
00:49:46.863 --> 00:49:49.030
Hewitt. you're with Parrish.

677
00:49:49.096 --> 00:49:51.763
Let's go.

678
00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:53.696
Is that a new uniform?

679
00:51:01.923 --> 00:51:04.823
- How'd you get in here?

680
00:51:04.889 --> 00:51:09.623
- The door was ajar.

681
00:51:09.689 --> 00:51:10.923
- Who are you?

682
00:51:10.989 --> 00:51:14.922
- Someone who knows you

683
00:51:14.988 --> 00:51:17.622
better than you know yourself.

684
00:51:17.688 --> 00:51:19.355
- Hands up where I can see 'em!

685
00:51:33.854 --> 00:51:36.721
- You are kitsune.

686
00:51:36.786 --> 00:51:39.086
but you don't know it.

687
00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:45.720
Your brother. Ekaida.
he knew it.

688
00:51:45.786 --> 00:51:48.420
but he never told you.

689
00:51:48.486 --> 00:51:51.353
- How do you know
about my brother?

690
00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:56.452
- The spirit in you. it's old.

691
00:51:56.519 --> 00:52:00.684
It's drawn to Beacon Hills.

692
00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:03.252
- Don't come any closer!

693
00:52:03.319 --> 00:52:07.018
- The power.

694
00:52:07.083 --> 00:52:09.950
it's like an armor
protecting you.

695
00:52:10.017 --> 00:52:13.650
But it cannot protect you now!

696
00:52:18.483 --> 00:52:19.683
- Ah!

697
00:52:22.517 --> 00:52:24.116
Ah. Oh!

698
00:52:24.217 --> 00:52:26.082
Oh!

699
00:52:26.217 --> 00:52:29.048
- There it is.

700
00:52:29.115 --> 00:52:32.282
I don't want your life.
little fox.

701
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:34.615
- Oh. Ah.

702
00:52:34.681 --> 00:52:37.881
- But I do want your tail.

703
00:52:37.948 --> 00:52:40.515
You have nine tails

704
00:52:40.581 --> 00:52:42.814
that can summon nine Oni.

705
00:52:44.315 --> 00:52:46.248
- Now

706
00:52:46.315 --> 00:52:50.380
give them to me!

707
00:52:50.447 --> 00:52:52.247
- Scott.
- Yeah.

708
00:52:52.314 --> 00:52:53.714
- We don't know where she's
going or what she's doing.

709
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:55.214
- Or how the hell she's alive.

710
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.046
- Well. can we answer that
question after we find her?

711
00:52:57.113 --> 00:52:58.713
- That woman may look
like Allison.

712
00:52:58.779 --> 00:53:00.413
but it doesn't mean
that she is Allison.

713
00:53:00.479 --> 00:53:01.879
- She didn't recognize me.

714
00:53:01.946 --> 00:53:04.279
- Me either.

715
00:53:04.346 --> 00:53:05.313
But she saw me heal.

716
00:53:05.379 --> 00:53:06.845
She knows what I am.

717
00:53:06.912 --> 00:53:09.246
- So she doesn't remember us but
she knows about werewolves.

718
00:53:09.313 --> 00:53:10.945
It's frighteningly convenient
for a werewolf hunter

719
00:53:11.012 --> 00:53:14.111
who just got brought back
to life.

720
00:53:14.212 --> 00:53:16.412
- She also knew how to kick ass.

721
00:53:16.478 --> 00:53:17.744
specifically my ass.

722
00:53:17.811 --> 00:53:19.011
- Hold on.

723
00:53:19.077 --> 00:53:20.644
When I told her
my last name was McCall.

724
00:53:20.711 --> 00:53:22.444
she looked at me like she...

725
00:53:22.511 --> 00:53:23.777
was expecting something else.

726
00:53:23.844 --> 00:53:25.577
- Hale.

727
00:53:25.644 --> 00:53:27.377
But if the only thing
that she remembers right now

728
00:53:27.444 --> 00:53:29.743
is that she hunts
and kills werewolves--

729
00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:31.277
- Then we need to find Derek.

730
00:53:31.344 --> 00:53:32.476
- I'm coming with you.

731
00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:33.976
OK.

732
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:58.374
- Allison.

733
00:54:13.373 --> 00:54:14.407
- Who are you?

734
00:54:14.473 --> 00:54:16.972
A friend.

735
00:54:17.039 --> 00:54:21.206
despite appearances.

736
00:54:22.805 --> 00:54:27.771
A friend with a fondness
for...

737
00:54:27.838 --> 00:54:30.671
riddles.

738
00:54:30.738 --> 00:54:32.705
- I don't remember
liking riddles.

739
00:54:32.771 --> 00:54:36.937
- Oh. you'll like this one.

740
00:54:37.004 --> 00:54:41.437
What's another word
for the metal silver.

741
00:54:41.504 --> 00:54:46.036
and also the name
of a legendary family

742
00:54:46.103 --> 00:54:50.703
who hunts werewolves?

743
00:54:50.769 --> 00:54:52.269
- Argent.

744
00:54:52.336 --> 00:54:58.203
- Allison Argent.

745
00:54:58.269 --> 00:55:01.203
Time to hunt.

746
00:55:01.269 --> 00:55:05.835
Time to kill Scott McCall.

747
00:55:05.901 --> 00:55:09.834
the werewolf
who destroyed your family.

748
00:55:09.901 --> 00:55:11.368
- I don't remember that name.

749
00:55:11.434 --> 00:55:14.267
- Oh. you will.

750
00:55:14.334 --> 00:55:16.100
We will help you.

751
00:55:16.201 --> 00:55:17.900
- I don't fucking trust you.

752
00:55:17.966 --> 00:55:19.900
- You would trust your mother.
wouldn't you?

753
00:55:24.266 --> 00:55:27.366
- You're not my mother.

754
00:55:27.433 --> 00:55:29.099
- But aren't I precisely
the voice

755
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.665
you need to hear right now?

756
00:55:30.732 --> 00:55:33.499
- No. my mother's dead.

757
00:55:33.565 --> 00:55:36.732
- No. No.

758
00:55:36.799 --> 00:55:39.031
- That's why I'm here.

759
00:55:39.098 --> 00:55:42.064
- Our side has suffered
so many losses.

760
00:55:42.199 --> 00:55:48.964
Allison. you have to remember
Scott McCall. Derek Hale.

761
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:51.498
Those men.
those monsters have murdered

762
00:55:51.564 --> 00:55:53.030
so many innocent people.

763
00:55:53.097 --> 00:55:54.830
They have to be stopped.

764
00:55:57.198 --> 00:55:59.963
- What do you want me to do?

765
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:03.630
- The betas make the alpha
stronger.

766
00:56:03.696 --> 00:56:05.696
- So I take out
the weakest members first?

767
00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:08.629
- Scott McCall has too many
allies right now.

768
00:56:08.696 --> 00:56:10.096
- So how do I get to him?

769
00:56:10.196 --> 00:56:12.961
- The Oni will clear a path.

770
00:56:13.028 --> 00:56:16.296
They will clear the board
of the other pieces.

771
00:56:16.362 --> 00:56:21.228
leaving you to concentrate
on a winning move.

772
00:56:21.295 --> 00:56:23.994
- What's the winning move?

773
00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:27.727
- In the game of Go.

774
00:56:27.794 --> 00:56:29.994
we call it the divine move.

775
00:56:39.194 --> 00:56:40.294
- None of my texts
are going through.

776
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.793
I can't reach...

777
00:56:42.859 --> 00:56:44.992
anyone.

778
00:56:45.058 --> 00:56:47.459
- Do you think that's connected?

779
00:56:55.892 --> 00:56:57.392
Oh!

780
00:57:01.225 --> 00:57:03.292
- Someone was killed here.

781
00:57:03.357 --> 00:57:04.924
- Yeah. I'm pretty sure
a lot of people

782
00:57:04.991 --> 00:57:06.090
have been killed here. Lydia.

783
00:57:06.191 --> 00:57:07.657
- Recently.

784
00:57:09.756 --> 00:57:12.023
- Are we gonna be killed here?

785
00:57:23.423 --> 00:57:27.489
Please tell me that
Allison didn't do that.

786
00:57:27.555 --> 00:57:29.789
- Dad. put me down!

787
00:57:29.855 --> 00:57:30.888
Please put me down.

788
00:57:30.954 --> 00:57:32.355
- You said you couldn't walk.

789
00:57:32.422 --> 00:57:33.588
- I can hop.

790
00:57:41.754 --> 00:57:42.953
Ow.

791
00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.188
- You almost had that shot.

792
00:57:44.221 --> 00:57:45.653
- No. I didn't.

793
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.221
- Yes. you did. I saw it.
You were right at the goal.

794
00:57:48.287 --> 00:57:50.053
You're better than
you think you are.

795
00:57:50.187 --> 00:57:51.587
- I was in
for less than a minute.

796
00:57:51.653 --> 00:57:53.819
I got the ball for a second
and I got knocked on my ass

797
00:57:53.886 --> 00:57:55.919
and I twisted my ankle.

798
00:57:55.986 --> 00:57:57.886
It wasn't anything.
- Eli.

799
00:57:57.952 --> 00:57:58.986
- It was nothing.

800
00:57:59.052 --> 00:58:00.386
- It was something.

801
00:58:02.686 --> 00:58:06.186
I was watching Coach
and he saw it too.

802
00:58:06.252 --> 00:58:07.618
You're good.

803
00:58:07.685 --> 00:58:10.018
You're really good.

804
00:58:10.085 --> 00:58:12.718
And...if you can heal.

805
00:58:12.785 --> 00:58:14.385
you can play tomorrow night.

806
00:58:14.451 --> 00:58:17.351
and you can help them win.

807
00:58:17.418 --> 00:58:20.650
The first step to transforming
is healing.

808
00:58:20.717 --> 00:58:22.717
but you've got to be
willing to learn.

809
00:58:24.717 --> 00:58:26.350
- Ah.

810
00:58:31.516 --> 00:58:32.749
- Get down!

811
00:58:32.816 --> 00:58:34.716
Run! Run!

812
00:58:52.481 --> 00:58:54.081
Allison?

813
00:59:52.942 --> 00:59:54.742
- Ah!

814
01:00:09.175 --> 01:00:10.974
- Liam?

815
01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.707
Oh. shit.

816
01:00:15.039 --> 01:00:17.440
- Scott. get to Eli.

817
01:00:17.507 --> 01:00:18.873
- Derek. he's not here.

818
01:00:18.939 --> 01:00:20.806
- He was.

819
01:00:20.873 --> 01:00:22.140
He knows what to do.

820
01:00:22.207 --> 01:00:24.973
We--we have a plan.

821
01:00:25.039 --> 01:00:26.873
He has the--

822
01:00:26.939 --> 01:00:28.439
he has the car.

823
01:00:28.506 --> 01:00:30.072
- Don't--don't try to talk.

824
01:00:30.139 --> 01:00:34.273
- Eli. he'll go to the shop.

825
01:00:34.338 --> 01:00:36.738
He knows what to do.
He knows what to do.

826
01:00:36.805 --> 01:00:39.971
- Don't talk.

827
01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:42.037
Hey. hey!

828
01:00:42.104 --> 01:00:43.238
- Scott.
- What?

829
01:00:43.305 --> 01:00:45.371
- It's not just Allison.

830
01:00:45.437 --> 01:00:48.437
- It's the Oni. It's Nogitsune.
- They're coming.

831
01:00:55.003 --> 01:00:57.770
- Scott. what do we do?

832
01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:07.735
- Liam. get to Stilinski.
find Lydia.

833
01:01:07.802 --> 01:01:09.402
and tell them
we need their help.

834
01:01:09.469 --> 01:01:12.001
Tell them we need everyone.

835
01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:13.335
Malia. let's get him
out of here.

836
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.168
- It looks like the radius

837
01:01:25.201 --> 01:01:27.168
is about the same
as the previous fires.

838
01:01:27.234 --> 01:01:28.301
- Take the others
and see if you can find

839
01:01:28.368 --> 01:01:31.200
any kind of incendiary device.

840
01:01:31.267 --> 01:01:35.200
- Parrish.

841
01:01:35.267 --> 01:01:37.799
What's your take on this?

842
01:01:37.866 --> 01:01:39.832
- Are you asking me
as a deputy or?

843
01:01:39.899 --> 01:01:42.332
- As someone who's known to
set himself on fire

844
01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:44.366
because he's a demon called
a hellhound?

845
01:01:44.432 --> 01:01:46.166
- Yeah. but I'm a nice demon.

846
01:01:46.199 --> 01:01:48.665
- Given.

847
01:01:48.731 --> 01:01:50.965
Who set these fires?

848
01:01:51.031 --> 01:01:53.031
- Not an arsonist.
- Yeah.

849
01:01:53.166 --> 01:01:56.331
A serial arsonist would want
to watch the fire burn.

850
01:01:56.398 --> 01:01:59.165
not have it snuffed out
minutes after ignition.

851
01:01:59.198 --> 01:02:02.331
And plus they typically have
an emotional cooling off period.

852
01:02:02.397 --> 01:02:03.364
and--
- These are being set

853
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:04.764
one after another.

854
01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:06.530
And all that says one thing.
that these fires--

855
01:02:06.597 --> 01:02:09.464
- Are not about fire.

856
01:02:10.696 --> 01:02:12.297
- Go see what you can dig up.

857
01:02:12.364 --> 01:02:14.696
I'm gonna call our consultant.

858
01:02:25.495 --> 01:02:27.562
I know that sound.

859
01:02:36.262 --> 01:02:37.827
Parrish!

860
01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.227
Hewitt!

861
01:02:56.393 --> 01:02:59.325
Oh. God damn it.

862
01:02:59.392 --> 01:03:01.925
I knew I should've retired.

863
01:03:09.791 --> 01:03:11.724
Jeez!

864
01:03:21.023 --> 01:03:22.323
- Eli! Eli.

865
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:24.157
- We're gonna find him.

866
01:03:24.223 --> 01:03:25.290
But we have to help you first.

867
01:03:25.357 --> 01:03:27.257
- No. No. Eli.

868
01:03:27.323 --> 01:03:30.489
His ankle. he twisted it.
He can't run.

869
01:03:30.556 --> 01:03:31.789
- But he can heal.

870
01:03:31.856 --> 01:03:33.556
- No. he won't.
- Eli can't heal.

871
01:03:33.622 --> 01:03:35.789
not like a werewolf. not yet.

872
01:03:35.856 --> 01:03:37.289
- What's wrong with him?

873
01:03:37.356 --> 01:03:39.422
- You know how some people
pass out when they see a needle?

874
01:03:39.489 --> 01:03:40.855
Eli passes out when
he sees his own fangs.

875
01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:42.156
- He passes out?

876
01:03:42.222 --> 01:03:43.755
- The fangs come out.
- He's on the floor.

877
01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:46.020
Claws too.

878
01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:49.188
- Scott. you have to find him.

879
01:03:49.255 --> 01:03:51.987
You have to find him before
she does.

880
01:04:20.385 --> 01:04:21.618
- Sheriff!

881
01:04:25.784 --> 01:04:27.451
Sheriff!

882
01:04:29.284 --> 01:04:32.184
Where are you?

883
01:04:32.251 --> 01:04:33.916
- Mason?

884
01:04:33.983 --> 01:04:36.050
Mason. help.

885
01:04:37.883 --> 01:04:38.750
Help.

886
01:04:38.816 --> 01:04:40.683
Ah!

887
01:04:57.315 --> 01:04:58.681
- Sheriff.

888
01:05:00.249 --> 01:05:01.548
- No!

889
01:05:08.381 --> 01:05:09.613
Aw. shit.

890
01:05:34.811 --> 01:05:35.978
- Go!

891
01:05:39.445 --> 01:05:41.378
- All right. Come on.

892
01:05:44.344 --> 01:05:45.377
- Easy.

893
01:05:45.444 --> 01:05:47.010
- Here.

894
01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:49.210
- Easy. Easy.

895
01:05:49.277 --> 01:05:50.410
- You have to find Eli.

896
01:05:50.477 --> 01:05:51.577
Eli.

897
01:05:51.644 --> 01:05:53.144
You have to find Eli.

898
01:05:55.643 --> 01:05:59.209
Derek. you're gonna need to
let Scott and the others

899
01:05:59.276 --> 01:06:00.309
take care of it. OK?

900
01:06:00.376 --> 01:06:01.942
Anyone that loses
this much blood.

901
01:06:02.008 --> 01:06:03.276
human or werewolf.

902
01:06:03.343 --> 01:06:05.409
you're not gonna be any good
to anyone else.

903
01:06:05.475 --> 01:06:06.742
- We need a lighter.

904
01:06:06.808 --> 01:06:08.708
The healing process
works faster with fire.

905
01:06:11.907 --> 01:06:15.841
- I've been known to light
a spark or two in my time.

906
01:06:29.141 --> 01:06:31.440
- Peter. no.

907
01:06:51.239 --> 01:06:52.871
- Do I need to remind you people

908
01:06:52.938 --> 01:06:56.037
that he slashed my throat once
and it killed me?

909
01:06:56.138 --> 01:06:58.471
- When it comes to you.
most of us try to forget.

910
01:06:58.538 --> 01:07:01.537
- That is no way to speak
to your father.

911
01:07:01.603 --> 01:07:03.204
- Look.
we're running out of time.

912
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:04.603
We've got to catch up to Eli.

913
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:06.737
- You mean before Allison does.

914
01:07:08.503 --> 01:07:09.969
Allison Argent.
back from the dead.

915
01:07:10.036 --> 01:07:11.470
running around.
shooting up werewolves

916
01:07:11.536 --> 01:07:12.802
like a good little hunter?

917
01:07:12.869 --> 01:07:14.869
You must be so proud.

918
01:07:16.436 --> 01:07:19.236
- Can we just lower the level
of the testosterone

919
01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.801
in the room. fellas? Huh?

920
01:07:21.868 --> 01:07:22.935
- Derek said that
they had a plan

921
01:07:23.001 --> 01:07:24.136
for when something like this
happens.

922
01:07:24.202 --> 01:07:25.768
- The auto shop.

923
01:07:25.835 --> 01:07:27.768
That's where they'll go.

924
01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:28.901
Emergency rendezvous point.

925
01:07:28.967 --> 01:07:30.135
How far behind was Allison?

926
01:07:30.168 --> 01:07:31.800
- Not far enough.
- I'm coming with you.

927
01:07:31.867 --> 01:07:34.934
- No. You need to find Lydia.

928
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.734
Liam and Hikari are already
looking for Stilinski.

929
01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.334
but honestly. if there's anyone
who could figure

930
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.999
this thing out. it's Lydia.

931
01:07:40.134 --> 01:07:41.899
Find Lydia.
I'll get Eli.

932
01:07:41.966 --> 01:07:43.134
- Wait.
- I gotta go.

933
01:07:43.167 --> 01:07:44.499
- Wait!

934
01:07:44.566 --> 01:07:46.633
Scott. wait. wait.
- What. Mom? What?

935
01:07:48.933 --> 01:07:50.599
- If there's some small chance
that it's her.

936
01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:53.366
that it's really Allison--

937
01:07:53.433 --> 01:07:55.565
- It can't be. right?

938
01:07:55.632 --> 01:07:57.166
It's impossible.

939
01:07:57.233 --> 01:07:58.565
- Listen to me.

940
01:07:58.632 --> 01:08:00.898
If I've learned anything
living in Beacon Hills.

941
01:08:00.965 --> 01:08:02.897
it's that every time someone
says something's impossible.

942
01:08:02.964 --> 01:08:05.697
somehow the impossible
seems to happen.

943
01:08:05.764 --> 01:08:06.831
If you think it's really her.

944
01:08:06.897 --> 01:08:09.198
you have to find her
and stop her

945
01:08:09.265 --> 01:08:12.664
and help her remember
who she was.

946
01:08:12.731 --> 01:08:14.963
- I love you. Mom.
- I love you too.

947
01:08:17.596 --> 01:08:19.930
Go get her.

948
01:08:48.128 --> 01:08:49.561
- Come on.

949
01:09:58.721 --> 01:10:00.287
- What do you smell?

950
01:10:05.087 --> 01:10:06.720
- Fear.

951
01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:08.620
- That would be me.

952
01:10:11.686 --> 01:10:13.220
- You're gonna want to see this.

953
01:10:17.852 --> 01:10:20.052
- He was a kitsune.

954
01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.552
probably didn't even know it.

955
01:10:22.619 --> 01:10:23.885
If the Nogitsune murdered him.

956
01:10:23.952 --> 01:10:26.051
then he did it
to steal his tails.

957
01:10:26.119 --> 01:10:28.352
- The tails only get him
one thing:

958
01:10:28.419 --> 01:10:29.884
the Oni.

959
01:10:29.951 --> 01:10:31.051
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

960
01:10:31.119 --> 01:10:32.818
I have a tail.

961
01:10:32.884 --> 01:10:34.818
No one's planning on
stealing my tail. right?

962
01:10:34.884 --> 01:10:37.351
- Will you please shut up?

963
01:10:37.418 --> 01:10:40.618
There's more going on and
I think it's all connected.

964
01:10:40.683 --> 01:10:44.151
- More what?

965
01:10:44.218 --> 01:10:46.783
- Well. someone's
been setting fires.

966
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:48.350
- If Allison catches up to Eli.

967
01:10:48.417 --> 01:10:49.717
we might need
some real medical attention.

968
01:10:49.783 --> 01:10:51.450
not just a blow torch.

969
01:10:51.517 --> 01:10:54.217
- I feel like that
was aimed at me.

970
01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:56.416
- Get out of the way or
there'll be a gun aimed at you.

971
01:10:56.482 --> 01:10:57.616
- Of course.

972
01:10:57.682 --> 01:11:01.182
Just satisfy my curiosity
about one thing.

973
01:11:01.249 --> 01:11:03.648
Who are you going out there
to help.

974
01:11:03.715 --> 01:11:06.815
her or him.
predator or prey?

975
01:11:06.881 --> 01:11:10.215
- I'll stop anyone who tries to
kill an innocent 15-year-old.

976
01:11:10.281 --> 01:11:11.947
- And yet you look like
a man with doubts.

977
01:11:12.014 --> 01:11:13.248
Let's ask the expert.

978
01:11:13.315 --> 01:11:15.248
Mr. Deaton?

979
01:11:18.747 --> 01:11:20.247
- The Nogitsune is
an extraordinarily

980
01:11:20.314 --> 01:11:21.547
powerful creature.

981
01:11:21.614 --> 01:11:23.180
It can create illusions

982
01:11:23.247 --> 01:11:25.547
that are nearly
indistinguishable from reality.

983
01:11:25.613 --> 01:11:27.114
- Illusion.

984
01:11:27.147 --> 01:11:29.913
- But that illusion today.

985
01:11:29.979 --> 01:11:32.945
that looked pretty damn real
to me.

986
01:11:34.413 --> 01:11:35.513
- Me too.

987
01:11:35.579 --> 01:11:36.945
- I know what I saw.

988
01:11:43.345 --> 01:11:46.345
I saw an exact replica.

989
01:11:46.412 --> 01:11:50.344
meant to trick us
into lowering our guard.

990
01:11:50.411 --> 01:11:52.477
My daughter is gone.

991
01:11:52.544 --> 01:11:58.177
Whoever or whatever is out there
isn't Allison.

992
01:11:58.244 --> 01:11:59.876
It's an illusion.

993
01:11:59.943 --> 01:12:03.010
- Then I say.
let's dispel the illusion.

994
01:13:55.533 --> 01:13:56.833
- Allison. stop!

995
01:14:01.965 --> 01:14:05.532
Come on! Come on!
Go. go. go. go!

996
01:14:05.599 --> 01:14:07.799
Ah!
- Oh. shit.

997
01:14:07.865 --> 01:14:09.365
OK. Go.

998
01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:13.964
Oh! Ah. come on!

999
01:14:14.099 --> 01:14:15.298
Come on! Let's go!
- OK. OK.

1000
01:14:15.364 --> 01:14:17.099
- I know you don't
remember everything.

1001
01:14:17.164 --> 01:14:18.598
but if you stop trying to
kill us for half a second.

1002
01:14:18.664 --> 01:14:20.098
I could help you remember!

1003
01:14:24.797 --> 01:14:26.830
Come on! All right! Hey!

1004
01:14:26.897 --> 01:14:28.098
We're gonna have to run.

1005
01:14:28.098 --> 01:14:29.663
I need you to heal.
- I can't.

1006
01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:31.097
I can't heal. I can't transform.

1007
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:32.263
I can't do any of it.

1008
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:34.130
- Well. you're gonna learn
right now.

1009
01:14:35.263 --> 01:14:36.429
- How?

1010
01:14:36.496 --> 01:14:38.329
- Like this.

1011
01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.394
- We've got multiple calls
about a fire.

1012
01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.094
- Copy. Dispatch.
We're en route now.

1013
01:15:03.094 --> 01:15:06.594
Parrish. go to two.

1014
01:15:06.659 --> 01:15:08.593
- I'll hit the station.

1015
01:15:08.659 --> 01:15:10.094
But. Sheriff.

1016
01:15:10.127 --> 01:15:12.993
Mason. he just--he vanished.

1017
01:15:13.093 --> 01:15:15.393
- We don't know
what happened to him yet.

1018
01:15:15.459 --> 01:15:17.992
Right now.
I need you at the station.

1019
01:15:18.093 --> 01:15:19.126
I'll check Hale Auto.

1020
01:15:19.193 --> 01:15:21.425
You copy me?

1021
01:15:21.492 --> 01:15:23.093
- Copy. sir.

1022
01:15:27.158 --> 01:15:30.192
- Come on. Eli! Don't stop!
She's right behind us.

1023
01:15:31.924 --> 01:15:33.924
Come on. keep going.

1024
01:15:33.991 --> 01:15:35.091
Kid. come on. get up. get up!

1025
01:15:35.124 --> 01:15:38.457
Go. go. go! Right there. go!

1026
01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:45.124
Listen. you're gonna have to
keep going on without me.

1027
01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:46.356
- Wait. what are you
talking about?

1028
01:15:46.423 --> 01:15:47.690
- I have to try to
get through to her.

1029
01:15:47.756 --> 01:15:50.590
- She's trying to get
an arrow through you.

1030
01:15:55.655 --> 01:15:57.455
- What is that?

1031
01:15:57.522 --> 01:15:59.189
- Wolfsbane.

1032
01:15:59.255 --> 01:16:00.988
She coated the arrowheads
in wolfsbane.

1033
01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:02.888
- My dad told me you almost
had to cut his arm off once

1034
01:16:02.954 --> 01:16:04.988
because of wolfsbane poisoning.

1035
01:16:05.089 --> 01:16:06.454
- You need to run. Eli.

1036
01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:08.554
We're not far from the road.
I--I'll keep her busy.

1037
01:16:08.621 --> 01:16:11.920
- I can't. OK?
I can't do it without you.

1038
01:16:11.987 --> 01:16:14.288
- Hey. you're gonna be
all right. OK?

1039
01:16:14.354 --> 01:16:15.620
Remember. you just learned
how to heal.

1040
01:16:15.687 --> 01:16:16.753
- You did that for me.

1041
01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:18.587
- I gave you a push.

1042
01:16:18.653 --> 01:16:21.420
And if Allison has any chance
of remembering who she is.

1043
01:16:21.487 --> 01:16:23.952
she's gonna need the same push.

1044
01:16:24.087 --> 01:16:25.253
Find your dad.

1045
01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.552
I think I'm gonna need his help.

1046
01:16:26.619 --> 01:16:29.087
- Yeah. OK.

1047
01:16:33.386 --> 01:16:35.086
- Yeah. the fires all happened

1048
01:16:35.152 --> 01:16:37.951
right after the jar
was taken from Japan.

1049
01:16:38.086 --> 01:16:40.152
- Liam. that's him.

1050
01:16:40.218 --> 01:16:41.185
- That's the guy
who stole the jar.

1051
01:16:41.251 --> 01:16:43.151
the one who freed the Nogitsune.

1052
01:16:43.218 --> 01:16:44.817
- He's the one
setting the fires.

1053
01:16:44.884 --> 01:16:46.850
- And not the Nogitsune?

1054
01:16:46.917 --> 01:16:49.251
Why don't we catch him
and kill the Nogitsune?

1055
01:16:49.318 --> 01:16:50.584
That sounds like
a pretty good plan to me.

1056
01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:52.484
- Well. the Nogitsune's
not a person.

1057
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:56.450
It's an ancient power. so old
it's practically elemental.

1058
01:16:56.517 --> 01:16:58.284
It might not be possible
to kill him.

1059
01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:00.749
- Well. I'm willing
to give it a shot.

1060
01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:03.483
- We're wasting time.

1061
01:17:03.549 --> 01:17:05.083
You guys can figure out
who's starting the fire.

1062
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:06.815
We need to find Scott.

1063
01:17:25.714 --> 01:17:29.081
- She drove this one.
smashed right into Derek's.

1064
01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.181
- You smell something else?

1065
01:17:34.913 --> 01:17:37.080
Anger.

1066
01:17:37.113 --> 01:17:39.413
The air. it's rife
with a homicidal rage.

1067
01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:41.380
She certainly has the anger
of an Argent.

1068
01:17:41.446 --> 01:17:44.180
- Then it's more proof
it's not Allison.

1069
01:17:44.246 --> 01:17:46.213
My daughter wouldn't kill
a 15-year-old boy.

1070
01:17:46.279 --> 01:17:47.812
- You had the Nogitsune
in your head.

1071
01:17:47.879 --> 01:17:48.979
Maybe it's in hers.

1072
01:17:49.079 --> 01:17:50.212
- If there's room enough.

1073
01:17:50.279 --> 01:17:52.079
with all of that
unadulterated fury.

1074
01:17:52.079 --> 01:17:54.644
- Not everybody has your anger.

1075
01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:56.478
- Not everyone
has your optimism.

1076
01:17:56.544 --> 01:17:58.544
Don't underestimate anger.
Melissa.

1077
01:17:58.611 --> 01:18:00.344
We all have the same instinct
for fight or flight.

1078
01:18:00.411 --> 01:18:04.777
Flight begins with fear
but fight is born of anger.

1079
01:18:04.843 --> 01:18:06.344
- She put an arrow
into his truck.

1080
01:18:06.411 --> 01:18:09.443
They're on the run. that way.

1081
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:10.943
- Can you track 'em
through the woods?

1082
01:18:11.077 --> 01:18:12.510
both: Yes.

1083
01:18:20.776 --> 01:18:22.509
- Allison. stop!

1084
01:18:38.075 --> 01:18:40.175
I want to talk.

1085
01:18:41.108 --> 01:18:42.740
- Sure. let's talk.

1086
01:18:46.174 --> 01:18:47.706
- Dad? Dad?

1087
01:18:47.773 --> 01:18:48.973
- Eli?

1088
01:18:49.074 --> 01:18:50.473
Eli!

1089
01:18:53.673 --> 01:18:54.873
You're safe. Eli.

1090
01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:56.373
You're safe.

1091
01:18:56.439 --> 01:18:57.972
- Yeah. but Scott isn't.

1092
01:18:58.073 --> 01:19:00.139
- Hey. we got a problem.

1093
01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:03.206
- Three of them.

1094
01:19:18.571 --> 01:19:20.571
- It was done by a sword.

1095
01:20:14.032 --> 01:20:15.366
- Hikari!

1096
01:20:57.628 --> 01:20:58.828
- Dad!

1097
01:21:16.493 --> 01:21:18.660
- Oh. no!

1098
01:21:21.193 --> 01:21:22.560
- Deaton!

1099
01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:38.125
- Dad--

1100
01:21:47.623 --> 01:21:49.790
Remember who you are.

1101
01:21:58.157 --> 01:22:01.322
- Malia?
- Come on. Come on!

1102
01:22:13.788 --> 01:22:15.521
- Allison. if you just
give me one second.

1103
01:22:15.588 --> 01:22:17.755
I can tell you the truth.
- You killed half my family.

1104
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:20.620
- I never killed anyone.
and neither did you.

1105
01:22:25.654 --> 01:22:28.919
I know those daggers
have wolfsbane on them.

1106
01:22:29.054 --> 01:22:31.054
And I know you think you're
gonna go through with it.

1107
01:22:34.519 --> 01:22:36.319
- Because that's what
the Nogitsune wants.

1108
01:22:36.386 --> 01:22:40.053
He wants me to die
in your arms this time.

1109
01:22:40.053 --> 01:22:42.053
Are you ready for that?

1110
01:22:42.119 --> 01:22:44.086
Because it's not easy.

1111
01:22:44.618 --> 01:22:47.318
- Come on.

1112
01:22:54.717 --> 01:22:57.085
- Eli. what are you doing?

1113
01:22:57.152 --> 01:22:59.051
- I can do this.
- Oh. shit!

1114
01:23:01.384 --> 01:23:03.051
- No!

1115
01:23:19.183 --> 01:23:20.882
Eli.

1116
01:23:25.449 --> 01:23:26.914
- Whoa. OK. stop!

1117
01:23:27.049 --> 01:23:29.514
What's it gonna take to
get you to stop and listen?

1118
01:23:55.079 --> 01:23:57.246
OK. you killed me.

1119
01:23:57.312 --> 01:23:58.945
Now can we talk?

1120
01:23:59.046 --> 01:24:01.911
- Why is the guy who went to
Japan to free the Nogitsune

1121
01:24:02.046 --> 01:24:03.845
now in Beacon Hills trying
to burn down the woods?

1122
01:24:03.911 --> 01:24:05.245
- He's not trying to
burn down the woods.

1123
01:24:05.311 --> 01:24:08.844
It's...only part of it.

1124
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:10.710
- Do we have to play
junior detectives?

1125
01:24:10.777 --> 01:24:13.078
Can't we just leave it up
to the actual detectives?

1126
01:24:13.145 --> 01:24:15.477
- Do you see any actual
detectives standing around?

1127
01:24:18.876 --> 01:24:21.609
- But what do detectives do.
anyway?

1128
01:24:21.676 --> 01:24:24.244
Do they. like. go to
the scene of the crime and...

1129
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:26.576
detect something?

1130
01:24:28.609 --> 01:24:30.908
- That's exactly what they do.

1131
01:24:31.043 --> 01:24:33.309
- We need to look at
one of the burn sites.

1132
01:24:33.376 --> 01:24:35.309
the first one.

1133
01:24:35.375 --> 01:24:36.908
- Guys. guys.

1134
01:24:37.043 --> 01:24:38.375
Hi.

1135
01:24:38.442 --> 01:24:40.108
We got a big-ass problem.

1136
01:24:40.175 --> 01:24:43.575
Derek. Stilinski. Eli. Deaton.
they're all gone.

1137
01:24:43.641 --> 01:24:44.641
- What do you mean gone?

1138
01:24:44.707 --> 01:24:46.175
- They were taken.

1139
01:24:46.242 --> 01:24:47.841
- By who?

1140
01:24:48.907 --> 01:24:50.541
- The Oni.

1141
01:25:00.473 --> 01:25:03.373
There's blood...

1142
01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.939
all around here.
and a lot.

1143
01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.040
- If she managed to cut him
with her ring dagger

1144
01:25:08.106 --> 01:25:09.705
then he's in trouble.

1145
01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:11.272
They're laced with wolfsbane.

1146
01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:12.705
- How long does he have?

1147
01:25:12.772 --> 01:25:15.205
- Six. eight hours at most.

1148
01:25:23.838 --> 01:25:25.704
- These rapid burns...

1149
01:25:29.837 --> 01:25:32.737
There is something
systematic about it.

1150
01:25:32.803 --> 01:25:34.403
- Is she gonna keep
talking like this?

1151
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:37.137
- I stopped listening
six hours ago.

1152
01:25:37.203 --> 01:25:38.669
- All right. I'm sorry.

1153
01:25:38.736 --> 01:25:39.702
I'm not gonna spend
the rest of the day

1154
01:25:39.769 --> 01:25:40.702
walking through the woods.

1155
01:25:40.769 --> 01:25:42.436
trying to catch a pyromaniac.

1156
01:25:42.502 --> 01:25:43.902
- Do you have a better plan?

1157
01:25:44.037 --> 01:25:45.936
- We already know
what kills the Oni.

1158
01:25:46.036 --> 01:25:47.569
- Silver.

1159
01:25:47.636 --> 01:25:48.935
- You with me?

1160
01:25:49.036 --> 01:25:50.668
- Go.
Get all the silver you can.

1161
01:25:50.735 --> 01:25:52.835
And if you find the Oni.
don't fight them. kill them.

1162
01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:13.134
- We're heading back to
the main road. aren't we?

1163
01:26:15.833 --> 01:26:19.666
And my blood.
it's going to lure them.

1164
01:26:19.733 --> 01:26:21.865
I'm the bait for
the trap. right?

1165
01:26:24.133 --> 01:26:27.798
'Cause by the time the others
catch up to us. I'll be dead.

1166
01:26:27.865 --> 01:26:29.232
and you can pick the others
off one by one.

1167
01:26:29.298 --> 01:26:31.532
Is that the plan?

1168
01:26:31.598 --> 01:26:33.298
- Yeah. actually.
That is the plan.

1169
01:26:35.797 --> 01:26:37.864
- You don't hunt werewolves.
Allison.

1170
01:26:37.931 --> 01:26:40.331
And no matter what the Nogitsune
put into your head.

1171
01:26:40.397 --> 01:26:42.431
you don't kill them either.

1172
01:26:42.497 --> 01:26:43.863
And I think part of you
knows it.

1173
01:26:43.930 --> 01:26:46.064
I saw it the moment
you stabbed me.

1174
01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:48.863
- Saw what?

1175
01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:50.031
- Regret.

1176
01:26:53.096 --> 01:26:55.596
- Go.

1177
01:26:58.895 --> 01:27:02.595
- Jackson. what do you smell?

1178
01:27:02.662 --> 01:27:04.562
- Ugh. The horrifying
stench of death.

1179
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:06.728
- What else do you smell?

1180
01:27:11.162 --> 01:27:13.161
- It's not gas.

1181
01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:16.128
It's not lighter fluid
or anything like that.

1182
01:27:16.194 --> 01:27:17.727
It's different.

1183
01:27:17.793 --> 01:27:20.361
- Chemical accelerant.

1184
01:27:20.428 --> 01:27:22.028
Mm-hmm. It's a quick burn

1185
01:27:22.094 --> 01:27:24.660
so they can't set
the rest of the forest on fire.

1186
01:27:24.727 --> 01:27:27.060
- Well. does that tell us
anything useful?

1187
01:27:27.127 --> 01:27:31.193
- Well. in terms of the fire.
they know chemicals.

1188
01:27:34.559 --> 01:27:36.592
They know exactly
how to use them.

1189
01:27:36.659 --> 01:27:38.292
- I don't get it.
Why would someone

1190
01:27:38.359 --> 01:27:41.725
spend all this time and energy
burning up rowan trees?

1191
01:27:41.791 --> 01:27:43.259
- Rowan trees?
- Yeah.

1192
01:27:43.326 --> 01:27:45.026
That's what the smell is. right?

1193
01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:46.325
- Jackson. do you know
what rowan trees become

1194
01:27:46.391 --> 01:27:47.591
after they're burned?

1195
01:27:47.658 --> 01:27:49.791
- Ash?

1196
01:27:53.425 --> 01:27:55.325
- Mountain ash.

1197
01:28:02.024 --> 01:28:04.889
- You're not gonna kill me.

1198
01:28:05.024 --> 01:28:09.223
- That's right. The wolfsbane is
going to kill you.

1199
01:28:09.289 --> 01:28:10.689
- You had a code.

1200
01:28:10.756 --> 01:28:12.056
- Mm-hmm.

1201
01:28:12.123 --> 01:28:13.423
"We hunt those who hunt us."

1202
01:28:13.489 --> 01:28:16.722
- No.

1203
01:28:16.788 --> 01:28:19.655
You came up with a new one.

1204
01:28:19.722 --> 01:28:23.854
"We protect--"
- "We protect those who...

1205
01:28:23.921 --> 01:28:26.587
cannot protect themselves."

1206
01:28:26.654 --> 01:28:28.754
- You remember.

1207
01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:46.253
- We should grab
whatever we can.

1208
01:28:51.619 --> 01:28:53.685
- I'm taking this.

1209
01:28:57.185 --> 01:28:58.485
- Don't worry.
It's not the look.

1210
01:28:58.552 --> 01:29:00.319
It's more of a...

1211
01:29:00.385 --> 01:29:03.218
"you look really hot holding
a tactical tomahawk" look.

1212
01:29:10.683 --> 01:29:14.184
- If we don't die tonight.
we can talk about it.

1213
01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:15.417
- Huh.

1214
01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:18.117
Then I'm definitely not
dying tonight.

1215
01:29:43.415 --> 01:29:46.547
- Scott.

1216
01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.148
- Yes. he's handsome.

1217
01:29:48.214 --> 01:29:50.847
History is replete
with handsome killers.

1218
01:29:50.913 --> 01:29:52.514
He's still a killer.

1219
01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:53.813
- What am I even doing here?

1220
01:29:53.879 --> 01:29:56.479
This--this can't be
the right thing to do.

1221
01:29:56.546 --> 01:29:59.379
- Don't get lost in useless
moral quandaries. Allison.

1222
01:29:59.446 --> 01:30:01.013
Stick to the plan.

1223
01:30:01.079 --> 01:30:03.079
Your father is on his way here
right now.

1224
01:30:03.146 --> 01:30:05.379
- I saw him at the hospital.
That was him.

1225
01:30:05.446 --> 01:30:09.979
- No. he's on his way and
he's bringing Peter Hale.

1226
01:30:10.046 --> 01:30:12.012
You remember what
that monster did to Kate?

1227
01:30:12.078 --> 01:30:14.911
He ripped her throat out
with his claws.

1228
01:30:14.978 --> 01:30:17.278
He'll do the same to you
if he gets the chance.

1229
01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:19.777
Don't you remember
how they burned us?

1230
01:30:19.844 --> 01:30:22.244
We lost years.

1231
01:30:22.311 --> 01:30:27.943
Can't you feel that life
stolen from you?

1232
01:30:28.011 --> 01:30:29.411
- I don't know what I feel!

1233
01:30:29.476 --> 01:30:31.310
- A few more hours
and the sun goes down.

1234
01:30:31.376 --> 01:30:33.510
We'll take care
of everything then.

1235
01:30:33.576 --> 01:30:35.909
They come out at night.

1236
01:30:35.976 --> 01:30:39.043
- Who?
- The Oni.

1237
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:43.775
And with them comes chaos.

1238
01:30:52.175 --> 01:30:54.341
- Eli.

1239
01:30:54.408 --> 01:30:56.374
Eli. can you hear me?

1240
01:31:14.373 --> 01:31:15.872
We're not dead.

1241
01:31:16.007 --> 01:31:18.406
- Not yet.

1242
01:31:20.472 --> 01:31:21.472
- Where are we?

1243
01:31:21.539 --> 01:31:23.805
- It's just an illusion.

1244
01:31:38.005 --> 01:31:40.170
- What about them?

1245
01:32:03.335 --> 01:32:06.035
If we don't come up with a way
to get this wolfsbane out soon.

1246
01:32:06.102 --> 01:32:09.701
I'm going to die.

1247
01:32:09.767 --> 01:32:11.634
We need to find Liam.

1248
01:32:11.701 --> 01:32:13.002
- Your beta?

1249
01:32:13.068 --> 01:32:15.634
- My friend.

1250
01:32:15.701 --> 01:32:17.401
Liam and Hikari.

1251
01:32:17.467 --> 01:32:19.167
- She's a kitsune.

1252
01:32:19.234 --> 01:32:22.034
That's why that arrow
didn't do anything to her.

1253
01:32:22.101 --> 01:32:23.900
- Because of the fox.

1254
01:32:24.001 --> 01:32:26.100
It protects her. like armor.

1255
01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:28.600
- It won't protect her
from the Oni.

1256
01:32:28.666 --> 01:32:30.333
- Nothing protected you either.

1257
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.265
- What do you mean?
- You died in my arms.

1258
01:32:38.065 --> 01:32:41.165
And if you let me.
I could prove it to you.

1259
01:32:43.431 --> 01:32:45.498
You're lying.

1260
01:32:45.564 --> 01:32:47.998
- Just give me a chance.

1261
01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:55.763
If you still
don't believe me. fine.

1262
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:57.998
Let me die.

1263
01:32:59.130 --> 01:33:01.030
- And what if I do?

1264
01:33:01.097 --> 01:33:03.397
- Well. then you're gonna
have to save me.

1265
01:33:07.662 --> 01:33:10.296
- Derek. I'm not so sure
even your strength

1266
01:33:10.362 --> 01:33:13.096
could break those bonds.
not here.

1267
01:33:13.162 --> 01:33:14.396
- Eli. are you OK?

1268
01:33:14.462 --> 01:33:15.996
How's your leg?

1269
01:33:16.029 --> 01:33:17.528
- Yeah. it's fine.

1270
01:33:17.595 --> 01:33:18.996
It's healed.

1271
01:33:18.996 --> 01:33:20.061
- You learn how to heal?

1272
01:33:20.128 --> 01:33:21.128
- Yeah. kind of.

1273
01:33:21.195 --> 01:33:22.661
Well. Scott did most of it.

1274
01:33:22.728 --> 01:33:24.794
- That's amazing!

1275
01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:26.295
- Hey. Derek.

1276
01:33:26.361 --> 01:33:27.427
Maybe you want to be
a little more subtle

1277
01:33:27.494 --> 01:33:30.194
with your antics.

1278
01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:33.594
- The Nogitsune isn't gonna
kill us. not yet.

1279
01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:36.559
He put us here to watch him win.

1280
01:33:36.626 --> 01:33:38.493
We're here for our pain.

1281
01:33:43.193 --> 01:33:44.858
- Do you guys hear that?

1282
01:33:49.658 --> 01:33:51.725
- It sounds like--

1283
01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:53.425
- Lacrosse.

1284
01:34:10.324 --> 01:34:11.991
- At least we know
she hasn't caught him yet.

1285
01:34:11.991 --> 01:34:14.157
- No. she's caught him.

1286
01:34:14.223 --> 01:34:16.556
Allison knows to retrieve
her arrows whenever she can.

1287
01:34:16.623 --> 01:34:18.990
This was left so we're
following the right trail.

1288
01:34:19.056 --> 01:34:20.589
- Guys.

1289
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:25.255
I don't think
we're following a trail.

1290
01:34:25.322 --> 01:34:27.689
We're being led into a trap.
and I think that's it.

1291
01:34:27.755 --> 01:34:28.989
It's the college stadium.

1292
01:34:29.055 --> 01:34:31.122
That's where the lacrosse
tournament's being held.

1293
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:32.588
- And while they play
a lacrosse game.

1294
01:34:32.654 --> 01:34:36.521
we'll be playing right
into the Nogitsune's game.

1295
01:34:36.588 --> 01:34:38.821
That's where he'll make
his final moves.

1296
01:34:38.888 --> 01:34:40.988
Let's just hope he hasn't
figured out a divine move.

1297
01:34:40.988 --> 01:34:42.154
- What's that?

1298
01:34:42.221 --> 01:34:43.620
- It's a move in the game of Go.

1299
01:34:43.687 --> 01:34:48.088
- It's a move so brilliant.
so inspired.

1300
01:34:48.153 --> 01:34:49.620
that it changes the shape
of the entire game.

1301
01:34:49.687 --> 01:34:53.619
A move that only a god
could make.

1302
01:34:53.686 --> 01:34:55.187
Divine.

1303
01:35:00.552 --> 01:35:02.785
- I think the accelerant
used to start these fires

1304
01:35:02.851 --> 01:35:06.052
might be the same one used to
start a fire over 20 years ago.

1305
01:35:06.119 --> 01:35:08.751
- Are you talking about the fire
that killed Derek's family?

1306
01:35:08.818 --> 01:35:11.518
- And there's one more thing.

1307
01:35:11.585 --> 01:35:14.717
The person who came up with this
formula is supposed to be dead.

1308
01:35:14.784 --> 01:35:16.285
- "Supposed to be dead"
is starting to be

1309
01:35:16.351 --> 01:35:17.985
a recurring theme around here.

1310
01:35:42.582 --> 01:35:45.248
- Just...hold on.

1311
01:35:46.748 --> 01:35:48.615
Please.

1312
01:35:58.147 --> 01:35:59.780
It's my license.

1313
01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:10.679
It was at the ice rink.

1314
01:36:10.745 --> 01:36:11.980
The other pictures
didn't come out

1315
01:36:12.013 --> 01:36:14.845
so I tore that one off for you.

1316
01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:16.812
After you died.

1317
01:36:16.879 --> 01:36:20.112
your father gave that to me.

1318
01:36:23.112 --> 01:36:25.878
- Lydia was there.

1319
01:36:25.979 --> 01:36:27.478
- And Stiles.

1320
01:36:29.811 --> 01:36:32.344
Remember the winter formal?

1321
01:36:35.044 --> 01:36:36.978
- I went with my friends.

1322
01:36:37.044 --> 01:36:40.110
Jackson and Lydia.

1323
01:36:40.177 --> 01:36:42.842
I don't remember anybody else.

1324
01:36:42.977 --> 01:36:44.776
- I was there.

1325
01:36:46.676 --> 01:36:50.609
And I found you inside.
and we danced.

1326
01:36:54.176 --> 01:36:56.476
- I don't remember any of that.

1327
01:36:58.641 --> 01:37:00.641
- We kissed.

1328
01:37:03.241 --> 01:37:06.275
And that was the first time
I told you that I loved you.

1329
01:37:09.474 --> 01:37:11.740
- Why did you do that?

1330
01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.274
- Because I love you.

1331
01:37:15.574 --> 01:37:16.773
When you broke up with me.

1332
01:37:16.839 --> 01:37:21.839
I said I knew we were
gonna be together.

1333
01:37:21.974 --> 01:37:25.139
And you told me...

1334
01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:27.639
"There's no such thing as fate."

1335
01:37:31.472 --> 01:37:34.505
Do you remember what
I told you back?

1336
01:37:40.671 --> 01:37:42.604
- "There's no such thing
as a werewolf."

1337
01:37:48.104 --> 01:37:49.604
- Tell me the rest.

1338
01:37:49.671 --> 01:37:52.870
- I can't. because I'm going
to die if you don't help me.

1339
01:37:52.971 --> 01:37:55.171
- What do I have to do?

1340
01:37:55.236 --> 01:37:58.136
- Wolfsbane only responds
to fire.

1341
01:37:58.203 --> 01:38:01.769
You've got to burn it out.

1342
01:38:03.970 --> 01:38:10.269
- A man looks at a photograph
of another man.

1343
01:38:10.335 --> 01:38:15.235
He says. "Brothers and sisters
have I none.

1344
01:38:15.302 --> 01:38:21.668
But this man's father
is my father's son."

1345
01:38:25.567 --> 01:38:28.234
Who is the man
in the photograph?

1346
01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:29.700
- My son.

1347
01:38:29.767 --> 01:38:31.333
- Ah.

1348
01:38:36.233 --> 01:38:37.967
- Don't be afraid.

1349
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.699
- Oh. of this guy? No. no way.

1350
01:38:40.766 --> 01:38:44.399
Oh. my God. he's touching me.

1351
01:38:44.466 --> 01:38:48.299
- The son of Derek Hale.

1352
01:38:48.366 --> 01:38:53.765
But not a wolf yet. is he?

1353
01:38:53.831 --> 01:38:56.298
When night falls.

1354
01:38:56.365 --> 01:39:00.730
he may earn his fangs.
his claws.

1355
01:39:00.797 --> 01:39:03.164
watching the rest of you die!

1356
01:39:16.863 --> 01:39:18.396
- Whoa. uh...

1357
01:39:18.463 --> 01:39:22.129
you couldn't find a lighter?

1358
01:39:22.196 --> 01:39:25.029
- Do you want to live or not?

1359
01:39:26.128 --> 01:39:28.162
- Burn it out.

1360
01:40:07.225 --> 01:40:08.824
- Eli. did you see that?

1361
01:40:08.891 --> 01:40:10.391
Did you see your eyes?

1362
01:40:10.458 --> 01:40:11.491
- How the hell am I supposed
to see my eyes?

1363
01:40:11.558 --> 01:40:12.691
They're the things I use to see.

1364
01:40:12.758 --> 01:40:14.924
- They were glowing.
- What?

1365
01:40:14.991 --> 01:40:16.124
They were?
- Yes.

1366
01:40:20.091 --> 01:40:21.423
- Oh.

1367
01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:23.123
- Wait. don't!

1368
01:40:24.257 --> 01:40:27.923
- Tell me. Eli.

1369
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:29.556
do you like riddles?

1370
01:40:29.622 --> 01:40:30.889
- I'm more of a limerick
kind of guy.

1371
01:40:30.957 --> 01:40:33.456
You know. I like the rhyming.

1372
01:40:34.822 --> 01:40:37.821
- Finstock. thanks for
reminding everyone here

1373
01:40:37.888 --> 01:40:40.821
that no team chokes
quite like Beacon Hills.

1374
01:40:40.888 --> 01:40:41.989
- We're still up. Hogan.

1375
01:40:43.688 --> 01:40:44.621
Shit!

1376
01:40:50.321 --> 01:40:51.487
- I need to find my father.

1377
01:40:51.554 --> 01:40:53.687
If he's here.
he's in danger too.

1378
01:40:55.087 --> 01:40:58.454
- Allison. wait.

1379
01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:02.819
Look. this isn't
just about us anymore.

1380
01:41:03.653 --> 01:41:06.053
- I think I remember you.

1381
01:41:06.119 --> 01:41:07.586
or maybe someone like you.

1382
01:41:07.653 --> 01:41:09.386
maybe someone
I was in love with.

1383
01:41:09.453 --> 01:41:12.453
And maybe--
maybe if I had more time.

1384
01:41:12.518 --> 01:41:13.953
I would remember everything.

1385
01:41:14.019 --> 01:41:16.785
But I can't help you right now.
I have to find my father.

1386
01:41:16.852 --> 01:41:20.052
I think he might be
the only one I have left.

1387
01:41:20.118 --> 01:41:21.585
- Yeah.

1388
01:41:31.184 --> 01:41:36.716
- Let's put one of the players
back in the game.

1389
01:41:36.783 --> 01:41:38.951
- No!

1390
01:41:57.514 --> 01:42:00.714
- Allison.
Hey! Allison. Allison.

1391
01:42:00.781 --> 01:42:02.214
They don't know that it's you.

1392
01:42:02.281 --> 01:42:04.181
Not even your own father.

1393
01:42:04.248 --> 01:42:06.813
So just...

1394
01:42:06.948 --> 01:42:09.480
be careful.

1395
01:42:09.547 --> 01:42:11.313
- I just tried to kill you.

1396
01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:14.713
and you're telling me
to be careful.

1397
01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:16.413
Why would you do that?

1398
01:42:20.412 --> 01:42:23.379
- Because I'm still in love
with you.

1399
01:42:37.478 --> 01:42:38.710
- Eli!

1400
01:42:38.777 --> 01:42:40.945
Where the hell
did you come from?

1401
01:42:41.011 --> 01:42:42.245
Get off the--hey!

1402
01:42:42.311 --> 01:42:43.844
Off the field!

1403
01:42:43.945 --> 01:42:46.710
Get off the field! Look at you!

1404
01:42:46.777 --> 01:42:47.944
- Eli?

1405
01:42:52.543 --> 01:42:54.944
- It's happening now.

1406
01:42:54.977 --> 01:42:57.409
The mountain ash is more
than a barrier.

1407
01:42:57.476 --> 01:42:59.243
It's a gateway between
his world and ours.

1408
01:42:59.309 --> 01:43:02.409
- Oh. I really hate when you
say shit like that.

1409
01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:04.642
Isn't it just ash?

1410
01:43:08.675 --> 01:43:10.608
- Parrish has to break
the barrier.

1411
01:43:10.675 --> 01:43:12.075
He's the only one
that can do it.

1412
01:43:14.275 --> 01:43:16.374
Jackson.

1413
01:43:16.942 --> 01:43:19.641
- OK. so it's a place.
but it's not real.

1414
01:43:19.707 --> 01:43:21.107
They're all there with my dad.

1415
01:43:21.174 --> 01:43:23.074
and they're alive.
- This part of the game?

1416
01:43:23.141 --> 01:43:24.640
It's like he's knocking
pieces off the board.

1417
01:43:24.706 --> 01:43:26.074
- So how come he put me
back on it?

1418
01:43:26.141 --> 01:43:27.241
- I don't know. but I need to
get you out of here.

1419
01:43:27.306 --> 01:43:28.706
Come on.

1420
01:43:28.773 --> 01:43:31.640
- Oh! What the hell was that?

1421
01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:33.573
- Mountain ash.

1422
01:43:43.939 --> 01:43:45.605
- It's him.

1423
01:43:45.671 --> 01:43:46.972
It's really him.

1424
01:43:47.039 --> 01:43:48.939
- It's him who?

1425
01:43:48.939 --> 01:43:50.939
- Adrian Harris.

1426
01:43:50.939 --> 01:43:52.771
- He kind of looks like
our chemistry teacher.

1427
01:43:52.838 --> 01:43:55.004
- I was your chemistry teacher.
Jackson.

1428
01:43:55.071 --> 01:43:56.238
you fucking imbecile.

1429
01:43:57.971 --> 01:44:01.503
- Do it. Scream. Lydia.
Scream like a banshee.

1430
01:44:01.570 --> 01:44:02.703
Oh. Oh. that's right.

1431
01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:05.437
You haven't screamed in years.
have you?

1432
01:44:05.503 --> 01:44:06.437
- What do you want from us?

1433
01:44:06.503 --> 01:44:08.537
- Well. I don't want an apology.

1434
01:44:08.602 --> 01:44:09.970
seeing as how
you ruined my life.

1435
01:44:10.037 --> 01:44:11.769
and you served me up
as a human sacrifice

1436
01:44:11.836 --> 01:44:13.037
to some demented druid.

1437
01:44:13.103 --> 01:44:15.302
- I was in London
for all of that.

1438
01:44:19.936 --> 01:44:21.535
- The sun's going down.

1439
01:44:21.601 --> 01:44:22.735
If the Oni come out at night--

1440
01:44:22.801 --> 01:44:24.735
- There's 10.000 people
in this stadium.

1441
01:44:24.801 --> 01:44:26.101
What are we supposed to do?

1442
01:44:26.168 --> 01:44:27.535
- Come on.

1443
01:44:27.601 --> 01:44:28.800
Hey. Coach?

1444
01:44:28.935 --> 01:44:29.968
- Come on.
- Coach!

1445
01:44:30.035 --> 01:44:31.135
Coach. hey!

1446
01:44:31.201 --> 01:44:32.268
- Oh. no. no. no. no.

1447
01:44:32.335 --> 01:44:33.467
Unacceptable.

1448
01:44:33.534 --> 01:44:34.767
You graduated. McCall.

1449
01:44:34.834 --> 01:44:36.334
You're not ruining this for me.

1450
01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.234
- Coach. every single person
in this stadium is in danger.

1451
01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:41.134
Is there any way to get them out
without panicking them?

1452
01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:42.533
- Yeah. you win the game.

1453
01:44:42.599 --> 01:44:44.167
- What happens
if they tie it up?

1454
01:44:44.234 --> 01:44:45.100
- Sudden death.

1455
01:44:45.167 --> 01:44:46.399
- Coach.

1456
01:44:46.466 --> 01:44:47.833
there's gonna be
10.000 sudden deaths

1457
01:44:47.934 --> 01:44:49.966
if we don't stop this game.

1458
01:44:55.233 --> 01:44:56.365
- Crap!

1459
01:44:56.432 --> 01:44:57.632
I haven't felt this level
of disappointment

1460
01:44:57.698 --> 01:44:59.232
since I lost my virginity.

1461
01:44:59.298 --> 01:45:00.832
You want to help us win. McCall?

1462
01:45:04.132 --> 01:45:06.032
Here.

1463
01:45:12.964 --> 01:45:16.931
Four minutes.
whoever scores first wins.

1464
01:45:16.931 --> 01:45:19.363
- Number 11?
That used to be my number.

1465
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:20.496
- Do you want it back?

1466
01:45:20.563 --> 01:45:22.263
- No. no. That's OK.

1467
01:45:22.330 --> 01:45:23.663
Just. if you're gonna wear
my number. you better score.

1468
01:45:23.730 --> 01:45:24.930
- I'll try.

1469
01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:26.463
- Let's go! Let's do it!

1470
01:45:26.530 --> 01:45:28.363
Asses on the field!

1471
01:45:28.429 --> 01:45:31.195
We score first!

1472
01:45:34.029 --> 01:45:36.495
- Come take a look. Lydia.

1473
01:45:37.761 --> 01:45:38.995
- This was no small
accomplishment.

1474
01:45:39.062 --> 01:45:40.962
This illusion has
several layers.

1475
01:45:41.029 --> 01:45:43.594
Here. Lydia.
let me show you one.

1476
01:45:43.661 --> 01:45:44.928
- You want me to watch
a lacrosse game?

1477
01:45:44.961 --> 01:45:46.461
- No. no.

1478
01:45:46.528 --> 01:45:48.961
I want you to watch
your friends die.

1479
01:45:49.028 --> 01:45:50.493
Come on.

1480
01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:51.627
Take a look through
the microscope.

1481
01:46:01.826 --> 01:46:03.292
- You didn't change.

1482
01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:06.192
- What?

1483
01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:07.326
- When they took Eli.

1484
01:46:07.392 --> 01:46:09.226
you didn't change.

1485
01:46:09.292 --> 01:46:13.391
- He means you didn't transform
in front of your son.

1486
01:46:13.458 --> 01:46:14.825
- I haven't.

1487
01:46:14.926 --> 01:46:18.658
He hasn't seen me like that.

1488
01:46:18.725 --> 01:46:20.690
Not since the first time.

1489
01:46:20.757 --> 01:46:23.058
- OK. what was the first time?

1490
01:46:23.125 --> 01:46:26.624
- I don't know
if he'd even remembers.

1491
01:46:26.690 --> 01:46:28.757
He might have been too young.

1492
01:46:28.824 --> 01:46:30.090
Coyotes had come into the house.

1493
01:46:30.157 --> 01:46:32.723
They clawed through
the screen door.

1494
01:46:32.789 --> 01:46:34.157
Eli was playing on the floor.

1495
01:46:34.224 --> 01:46:37.823
and they were heading
straight for him.

1496
01:46:37.924 --> 01:46:41.656
I transformed instantly.

1497
01:46:41.723 --> 01:46:44.788
Roared so loud it shook
the entire house.

1498
01:46:44.923 --> 01:46:49.388
Coyotes took off
and there was Eli.

1499
01:46:49.455 --> 01:46:51.222
looking up at me.

1500
01:46:53.955 --> 01:46:56.288
He was shaking.
He was--

1501
01:46:56.355 --> 01:47:00.121
he was terrified.

1502
01:47:00.187 --> 01:47:05.254
And he wouldn't let me
come near him for days.

1503
01:47:05.321 --> 01:47:08.786
That look of fear in his eyes
when he saw me.

1504
01:47:08.921 --> 01:47:10.987
I couldn't get it
out of my head.

1505
01:47:11.054 --> 01:47:14.153
- That's why he can't change.

1506
01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:17.953
- I think every time
he starts to. or...

1507
01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:21.920
maybe every time he tries.

1508
01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:25.352
he must see my face...

1509
01:47:25.419 --> 01:47:27.352
snarling back at him.

1510
01:47:36.684 --> 01:47:38.451
- Get it to McCall! To McCall!

1511
01:47:38.518 --> 01:47:41.051
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1512
01:47:47.283 --> 01:47:48.983
Whoa. Sh--

1513
01:47:53.749 --> 01:47:56.382
- I knew the Nogitsune
was too chaotic

1514
01:47:56.449 --> 01:47:58.516
to play this game on his own.

1515
01:47:58.582 --> 01:48:01.382
He needed me to help him win.

1516
01:48:01.449 --> 01:48:03.249
All I had to do was
give him my pain.

1517
01:48:03.316 --> 01:48:05.548
Thanks to you and Scott McCall.

1518
01:48:05.615 --> 01:48:06.715
I have plenty.

1519
01:48:06.781 --> 01:48:09.248
We all have pain.

1520
01:48:09.315 --> 01:48:12.115
- But Lydia's pain is
particularly appealing

1521
01:48:12.181 --> 01:48:13.614
to a thousand-year-old demon.

1522
01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:15.514
- My pain isn't anything to him.

1523
01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:19.180
- On the contrary. heartbreak
is a veritable delicacy

1524
01:48:19.247 --> 01:48:20.147
to the Nogitsune.

1525
01:48:20.214 --> 01:48:22.914
So give him a taste. Lydia.

1526
01:48:22.947 --> 01:48:24.980
Tell us why you left Stiles.

1527
01:48:25.047 --> 01:48:26.446
- Give us your pain.

1528
01:48:26.513 --> 01:48:29.579
or the next time.
I shoot Jackson in the head.

1529
01:48:29.646 --> 01:48:31.013
- No. Lydia.

1530
01:48:31.079 --> 01:48:32.579
Lydia. don't do it.

1531
01:48:32.646 --> 01:48:34.413
Don't do it!

1532
01:48:34.479 --> 01:48:37.412
- I left.

1533
01:48:37.478 --> 01:48:38.712
I left because of a dream.

1534
01:48:38.778 --> 01:48:40.678
- What happened in the dream?

1535
01:48:40.745 --> 01:48:42.245
- My eyes open...

1536
01:48:45.545 --> 01:48:47.912
And I see broken glass.

1537
01:48:51.012 --> 01:48:53.144
It's from a windshield.

1538
01:48:55.644 --> 01:48:59.077
And I'm crawling
on the pavement.

1539
01:49:01.077 --> 01:49:03.943
I'm trying to reach Stiles.

1540
01:49:06.543 --> 01:49:09.410
There was a crash.

1541
01:49:10.809 --> 01:49:14.142
We'd been thrown from the car.

1542
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:20.409
Except he's not moving.

1543
01:49:21.641 --> 01:49:24.909
He wasn't blinking.

1544
01:49:24.942 --> 01:49:25.909
He wasn't breathing.

1545
01:49:25.974 --> 01:49:28.908
- Lydia. it was just a dream.

1546
01:49:28.974 --> 01:49:31.740
- Until it happened again.

1547
01:49:31.807 --> 01:49:35.640
And again.

1548
01:49:35.707 --> 01:49:39.040
Becomes this recurring dream

1549
01:49:39.107 --> 01:49:41.107
until I can't tell anymore
that if it's a dream--

1550
01:49:41.173 --> 01:49:42.506
- Or a premonition.

1551
01:49:44.007 --> 01:49:45.806
- If I was never in
the car with him.

1552
01:49:45.907 --> 01:49:49.939
there wouldn't have to be
a crash.

1553
01:49:50.006 --> 01:49:52.072
And he wouldn't have to die.

1554
01:49:52.139 --> 01:49:54.505
- And you wouldn't
have to scream.

1555
01:49:54.571 --> 01:49:58.039
- Banshees don't scream.

1556
01:49:59.905 --> 01:50:03.171
They wail.

1557
01:50:09.304 --> 01:50:10.404
- New plan.

1558
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:11.670
You take the shot.
I'll cover you.

1559
01:50:11.737 --> 01:50:13.204
- Are you kidding?
- No. it's your shot!

1560
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:14.237
Come on.

1561
01:50:14.304 --> 01:50:15.904
- Where did this kid come from?

1562
01:50:15.970 --> 01:50:18.237
Is he even in high school?

1563
01:50:18.303 --> 01:50:19.636
- That's one of my best
students.

1564
01:50:19.703 --> 01:50:20.904
- He looks like he's 30.

1565
01:50:20.970 --> 01:50:22.403
Who the hell is that?

1566
01:50:23.835 --> 01:50:25.036
- That's Greenberg.

1567
01:50:26.903 --> 01:50:28.969
- What do you hear?

1568
01:50:29.036 --> 01:50:31.069
- It's like the game's happening
right next to us.

1569
01:50:31.135 --> 01:50:32.935
- I can hear it too.

1570
01:50:33.002 --> 01:50:34.468
I think my son's on the field.

1571
01:50:36.035 --> 01:50:37.868
- Yes! Take it!

1572
01:50:37.935 --> 01:50:40.367
Eli. take it to the rack!

1573
01:50:48.501 --> 01:50:51.167
Whoo!

1574
01:50:51.234 --> 01:50:52.500
- Yes!

1575
01:50:52.733 --> 01:50:53.867
- Yes!

1576
01:50:55.733 --> 01:50:57.333
- Holy shit!

1577
01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:59.033
Scott. did you see that?
Did you me score?

1578
01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:01.233
My dad was actually right.
I'm actually pretty good.

1579
01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.900
Oh. my God. my dad.

1580
01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:07.265
- This isn't over.

1581
01:51:07.332 --> 01:51:09.399
- We're gonna find the others.
Come on.

1582
01:51:09.465 --> 01:51:11.498
- Peter! Wait!

1583
01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:12.932
- No! No!

1584
01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:14.132
No more illusions.

1585
01:51:14.198 --> 01:51:16.731
- Where's Scott? Where's my son?

1586
01:51:16.798 --> 01:51:18.064
- He's on the field.

1587
01:51:18.131 --> 01:51:19.763
He's trying to save everyone.

1588
01:51:19.898 --> 01:51:21.198
He's playing the game.

1589
01:51:21.264 --> 01:51:23.098
- That most definitely
sounds like your son.

1590
01:51:23.164 --> 01:51:24.530
But as for your daughter--

1591
01:51:24.597 --> 01:51:26.497
- I forgot to tell you
something. Peter.

1592
01:51:26.563 --> 01:51:28.763
The arrow wasn't the only thing
Allison left behind.

1593
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:39.596
- Wolfsbane.

1594
01:51:47.395 --> 01:51:50.495
- You think I wouldn't recognize
my own daughter?

1595
01:51:50.561 --> 01:51:52.395
It is you.

1596
01:51:52.461 --> 01:51:53.995
- I don't know.

1597
01:51:54.061 --> 01:51:56.061
I don't know who or what I am.

1598
01:51:56.128 --> 01:51:57.660
But my friends are in trouble
and it's all my fault.

1599
01:51:57.727 --> 01:51:59.095
- No.

1600
01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:04.659
Dad. what's that?

1601
01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:13.426
- Allison?

1602
01:52:19.959 --> 01:52:22.926
- The real tournament begins.

1603
01:52:26.791 --> 01:52:28.724
- Where are we?

1604
01:52:28.791 --> 01:52:30.691
- We're in his world.

1605
01:52:34.657 --> 01:52:35.957
- This is it.

1606
01:52:36.024 --> 01:52:38.723
They're here.
They're all trapped here.

1607
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:40.391
- So are we.

1608
01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:44.390
- Something's happening.

1609
01:52:44.456 --> 01:52:46.623
- I think it already happened.

1610
01:53:04.788 --> 01:53:07.321
- I've killed Oni before.

1611
01:53:07.388 --> 01:53:09.088
- Then let's kill a few more.

1612
01:53:28.352 --> 01:53:29.887
- You can burn through this.
right?

1613
01:53:29.887 --> 01:53:31.619
You've done it before.

1614
01:53:31.686 --> 01:53:33.186
- That was years ago.

1615
01:53:33.252 --> 01:53:34.219
The amount of power
this is gonna take.

1616
01:53:34.286 --> 01:53:36.119
I don't know if I can do it.

1617
01:53:36.186 --> 01:53:37.919
- OK. What do you need?

1618
01:53:37.986 --> 01:53:39.119
You need a pep talk?

1619
01:53:39.185 --> 01:53:41.485
One of those "you can do this"
speeches?

1620
01:53:41.551 --> 01:53:44.885
I don't do speeches.
I don't do pep talks.

1621
01:53:44.885 --> 01:53:46.418
I'm not here to boost your ego.

1622
01:53:46.484 --> 01:53:47.885
And I'm not gonna be
your cheerleader.

1623
01:53:47.951 --> 01:53:50.184
So whatever you need to do
to get your shit together.

1624
01:53:50.250 --> 01:53:51.350
you gotta do this for yourself

1625
01:53:51.417 --> 01:53:54.184
and you gotta do this right now.

1626
01:53:54.250 --> 01:53:57.250
You are a hellhound
that burns hellfire.

1627
01:53:57.317 --> 01:53:59.217
Now burn this fucker up!

1628
01:54:22.882 --> 01:54:24.114
- We can't get loose.

1629
01:54:24.181 --> 01:54:26.247
- Dad.

1630
01:54:26.314 --> 01:54:28.147
- Parrish. we need to
buy him more time.

1631
01:54:28.214 --> 01:54:29.414
- Go ahead. Lydia.

1632
01:54:29.481 --> 01:54:31.513
Watch your friends suffer.

1633
01:54:36.713 --> 01:54:38.680
- Look out!

1634
01:54:52.245 --> 01:54:54.879
- Fight. Allison. Come on.

1635
01:54:54.912 --> 01:54:56.611
- She'll hear you.

1636
01:54:56.678 --> 01:54:58.879
Mountain ash doesn't work
on banshees.

1637
01:55:21.142 --> 01:55:24.476
- Allison is alive.

1638
01:55:24.542 --> 01:55:26.541
Your best friend is alive.

1639
01:55:26.608 --> 01:55:29.109
and she's out there
fighting for her life.

1640
01:55:29.176 --> 01:55:30.942
Don't lose her again.

1641
01:55:31.009 --> 01:55:34.308
She'll hear you.

1642
01:55:34.375 --> 01:55:37.241
Lydia. she'll hear you.

1643
01:55:39.774 --> 01:55:42.008
Allison!

1644
01:57:37.564 --> 01:57:41.130
I remember.

1645
01:57:41.197 --> 01:57:43.363
I remember everything.

1646
01:57:43.429 --> 01:57:47.728
- We're not done yet.

1647
01:57:47.863 --> 01:57:52.163
The game is mine.

1648
01:57:58.328 --> 01:57:59.862
- Take me.

1649
01:57:59.862 --> 01:58:01.462
Let the others go.

1650
01:58:01.527 --> 01:58:05.862
- All the lives here
belong to me.

1651
01:58:05.928 --> 01:58:07.027
- All you need is me.

1652
01:58:07.094 --> 01:58:09.861
- Scott. don't do this.

1653
01:58:09.927 --> 01:58:12.861
- Allison kills me.
I die in her arms.

1654
01:58:12.927 --> 01:58:14.760
the same way that
she died in mine.

1655
01:58:14.861 --> 01:58:16.593
That's the move that wins
the game. isn't it?

1656
01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:19.060
- I've already won.

1657
01:58:19.126 --> 01:58:22.960
You lose!
Until I'm off the board!

1658
01:58:23.026 --> 01:58:24.860
And I'm still standing.

1659
01:58:24.926 --> 01:58:26.226
And I'm still the alpha.

1660
01:58:26.292 --> 01:58:28.625
An arrow to the heart

1661
01:58:28.692 --> 01:58:32.659
to save everyone else?

1662
01:58:32.724 --> 01:58:36.092
- All the other players

1663
01:58:36.159 --> 01:58:38.724
go free.

1664
01:58:49.024 --> 01:58:50.091
- No.

1665
01:58:50.157 --> 01:58:52.890
No. I can't.

1666
01:58:52.957 --> 01:58:54.457
I--I can't--

1667
01:58:54.523 --> 01:58:56.323
I cannot--no.

1668
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:58.522
- No.

1669
01:58:58.589 --> 01:59:01.389
- Kill him. Allison.

1670
01:59:01.456 --> 01:59:04.922
and I win the game.

1671
01:59:04.989 --> 01:59:06.721
- Allison. please.

1672
01:59:06.856 --> 01:59:08.956
Don't make me watch
my friends and my family die.

1673
01:59:27.354 --> 01:59:33.120
- Game is mine!

1674
01:59:33.187 --> 01:59:36.553
Kill him!

1675
02:00:30.849 --> 02:00:33.148
Something tells me
this isn't over.

1676
02:00:33.214 --> 02:00:36.448
- I certainly hope not.

1677
02:00:36.513 --> 02:00:38.248
- Scream all you want. Lydia.

1678
02:00:38.314 --> 02:00:40.048
- No!
- The game is over.

1679
02:00:43.413 --> 02:00:47.746
- The wolves howl to
signal their position...

1680
02:00:47.813 --> 02:00:51.047
- To the rest of the pack.

1681
02:00:51.113 --> 02:00:56.046
Tell me. Scott McCall.

1682
02:00:56.112 --> 02:01:00.112
what is the sound

1683
02:01:00.179 --> 02:01:05.111
of the wolf who is ready to die?

1684
02:01:05.178 --> 02:01:08.211
- I'd tell you.

1685
02:01:08.278 --> 02:01:09.845
but I'm not ready to die.

1686
02:01:29.609 --> 02:01:32.243
- Fox fire.

1687
02:02:25.703 --> 02:02:27.838
- What is that?

1688
02:02:27.871 --> 02:02:30.204
- Silver. you motherfucker.

1689
02:03:04.534 --> 02:03:06.467
- Come on. come on.

1690
02:03:08.434 --> 02:03:09.934
- OK. Stop. Stop.

1691
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.267
The only way we can
break the bonds

1692
02:03:11.334 --> 02:03:13.599
is with our strength combined.
you and me.

1693
02:03:13.666 --> 02:03:15.566
- What strength?
I don't have any strength.

1694
02:03:15.633 --> 02:03:17.099
- Your will as a wolf.

1695
02:03:17.166 --> 02:03:19.199
We do it together.

1696
02:03:20.566 --> 02:03:22.966
You're my son.

1697
02:03:23.033 --> 02:03:24.199
You're a Hale.

1698
02:03:28.432 --> 02:03:30.298
A werewolf.

1699
02:03:38.932 --> 02:03:41.264
Go!

1700
02:03:55.562 --> 02:03:57.729
- Mason! Sheriff!

1701
02:04:17.528 --> 02:04:18.828
- No!

1702
02:04:24.527 --> 02:04:26.827
Do you remember. Scott.

1703
02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:29.827
the gift that you gave me?

1704
02:04:29.827 --> 02:04:34.559
The bite of the alpha.

1705
02:04:34.626 --> 02:04:39.959
the power of the werewolf.

1706
02:05:36.921 --> 02:05:39.620
- Derek. it's not real.

1707
02:05:39.686 --> 02:05:41.520
- It's just another illusion.

1708
02:05:41.586 --> 02:05:42.520
- Dad?

1709
02:05:42.586 --> 02:05:44.486
- Eli?

1710
02:05:44.553 --> 02:05:45.853
Eli. can you hear me?

1711
02:05:48.452 --> 02:05:49.452
- Yeah.

1712
02:05:49.519 --> 02:05:51.485
Yeah. I can hear you.

1713
02:05:58.819 --> 02:06:00.052
- Eli!

1714
02:06:21.050 --> 02:06:23.983
- Harris had his chance.

1715
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:26.516
Now it's my turn.

1716
02:06:26.582 --> 02:06:29.582
my revenge.

1717
02:06:29.649 --> 02:06:34.182
I'm going to kill them all.

1718
02:06:34.248 --> 02:06:37.981
starting with this child
right here.

1719
02:06:38.048 --> 02:06:40.815
- You wanna kill someone.
start with me!

1720
02:06:48.647 --> 02:06:49.680
- We can't fight him alone.

1721
02:06:49.815 --> 02:06:50.980
He's too strong.

1722
02:06:51.047 --> 02:06:52.080
We have to break the illusion.

1723
02:06:52.147 --> 02:06:53.546
We have to catch him.

1724
02:06:53.613 --> 02:06:55.947
- You can't catch me.

1725
02:06:56.014 --> 02:06:59.513
You can't kill me.

1726
02:06:59.579 --> 02:07:03.612
You can't even find me.

1727
02:07:03.678 --> 02:07:05.413
- You're right.

1728
02:07:05.478 --> 02:07:07.813
We can't find you...

1729
02:07:07.813 --> 02:07:10.212
but we can find each other.

1730
02:07:10.278 --> 02:07:12.812
- A wolf howls
to signal its pack.

1731
02:07:12.812 --> 02:07:14.378
- What about a werewolf?

1732
02:07:15.812 --> 02:07:17.145
- A werewolf roars.

1733
02:07:52.341 --> 02:07:54.408
- Hey. hold him!
We gotta hold him!

1734
02:07:54.474 --> 02:07:56.341
- You can't!
You'll both burn up with him!

1735
02:08:15.539 --> 02:08:17.372
- Scott!
- What?

1736
02:08:17.439 --> 02:08:19.172
- You're the alpha.

1737
02:08:19.239 --> 02:08:20.639
He's part of your pack now.

1738
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:43.437
- Parrish!

1739
02:08:43.504 --> 02:08:44.569
Light this fucker up.

1740
02:09:00.969 --> 02:09:02.102
- Dad?

1741
02:10:16.728 --> 02:10:18.395
- Here. let me help you.

1742
02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:25.427
- Hikari!
- Liam!

1743
02:10:56.724 --> 02:10:59.158
- Lydia.
- Allison!

1744
02:11:39.554 --> 02:11:43.587
- The first night
I met Derek Hale.

1745
02:11:43.653 --> 02:11:44.687
he saved my life.

1746
02:11:47.420 --> 02:11:49.788
Then he said we were brothers.

1747
02:11:49.853 --> 02:11:54.187
and I thought that he was crazy.

1748
02:11:54.253 --> 02:11:57.386
But no. No. he was right.

1749
02:11:59.552 --> 02:12:03.219
Eli. from that moment on.
we were brothers.

1750
02:12:04.786 --> 02:12:06.685
And. uh...

1751
02:12:06.786 --> 02:12:10.251
Derek Hale was the first person
to teach me that

1752
02:12:10.318 --> 02:12:14.617
you don't just get the family
that you were born with.

1753
02:12:16.517 --> 02:12:18.450
You get the family
that you find.

1754
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:22.984
- You know. I'm not sure
how your dad would feel

1755
02:12:23.050 --> 02:12:24.517
about me giving you the Jeep.

1756
02:12:24.584 --> 02:12:29.283
But. um. something tells me
it's the right thing to do.

1757
02:12:29.349 --> 02:12:31.249
- He hated that Jeep.

1758
02:12:31.316 --> 02:12:33.649
- After my son left it behind.

1759
02:12:33.784 --> 02:12:37.483
Derek towed it in. thinking it
was probably beyond repair.

1760
02:12:37.548 --> 02:12:39.482
But then he opened up the hood
and he pulled off

1761
02:12:39.548 --> 02:12:42.783
all the duct tape
Stiles had stuck on it.

1762
02:12:42.816 --> 02:12:44.648
And he managed to fix it.

1763
02:12:46.515 --> 02:12:48.547
- That Jeep.

1764
02:12:48.614 --> 02:12:50.982
no matter
what's been done to it.

1765
02:12:51.048 --> 02:12:53.614
it just keeps running.

1766
02:12:53.681 --> 02:12:56.681
He could never figure out
why it wouldn't break down

1767
02:12:56.781 --> 02:13:00.147
and stay down.

1768
02:13:00.214 --> 02:13:01.446
And I don't think
he ever realized that

1769
02:13:01.513 --> 02:13:04.280
that's exactly
the way we saw him.

1770
02:13:04.346 --> 02:13:07.546
I have never seen anyone

1771
02:13:07.613 --> 02:13:10.780
take the kind of punishment
that Derek Hale took...

1772
02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:15.579
And kept taking...

1773
02:13:16.846 --> 02:13:18.645
In order to protect
the people he loved.

1774
02:13:45.642 --> 02:13:48.309
- He kept standing back up...

1775
02:14:02.908 --> 02:14:06.775
- Until the day he couldn't.

1776
02:14:06.808 --> 02:14:08.407
Hey.

1777
02:14:08.474 --> 02:14:12.607
Your dad had complicated
feelings about that Jeep.

1778
02:14:12.674 --> 02:14:16.074
But it doesn't mean it needs
to be complicated for you.

1779
02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:19.774
All you got to do...

1780
02:14:19.807 --> 02:14:22.206
is keep it running.

1781
02:14:22.273 --> 02:14:24.873
Just keep it going.

1782
02:14:57.503 --> 02:14:59.603
- Don't get too attached.

1783
02:15:01.203 --> 02:15:03.770
- We got adoptions on Saturday.

1784
02:15:03.770 --> 02:15:05.003
- Eventually him.

1785
02:15:05.070 --> 02:15:06.369
- I know you're gonna be
tempted.

1786
02:15:06.435 --> 02:15:08.969
but not a lot of treats.
He's still growing dog.

1787
02:15:09.035 --> 02:15:10.902
- Oh. really?
- Yeah.

1788
02:15:10.969 --> 02:15:12.135
- He's pretty heavy already.

1789
02:15:12.202 --> 02:15:14.102
- When he's ready.

1790
02:15:14.169 --> 02:15:15.568
Hi.

1791
02:15:20.101 --> 02:15:21.634
- I have this feeling.

1792
02:15:21.768 --> 02:15:24.234
It's like.
all this time has passed

1793
02:15:24.301 --> 02:15:26.768
and I want to figure out
how to get it back.

1794
02:15:27.467 --> 02:15:29.001
Like. I'm happy for everything
that's ahead of me.

1795
02:15:29.067 --> 02:15:32.167
but I--I just--

1796
02:15:32.233 --> 02:15:36.100
I feel this kind of regret.
you know?

1797
02:15:36.167 --> 02:15:38.767
I think--

1798
02:15:38.767 --> 02:15:40.366
I think I feel...

1799
02:15:42.366 --> 02:15:44.399
- Wistful.

1800
02:15:46.966 --> 02:15:48.498
- Yeah. that's exactly it.

1801
02:15:51.265 --> 02:15:53.398
Do you feel that way?

1802
02:15:56.865 --> 02:15:58.798
- No.

1803
02:16:00.765 --> 02:16:04.130
I'm not worried about the past.

1804
02:16:04.197 --> 02:16:08.330
because now I have a future.

1805
02:16:08.397 --> 02:16:10.930
With him.

1806
02:16:10.997 --> 02:16:12.629
And you.

1807
02:16:22.495 --> 02:16:25.896
- OK. quiet.

1808
02:16:45.426 --> 02:16:48.226
- Why did we stop?

1809
02:16:48.293 --> 02:16:50.426
Hey. I thought--I thought
I was gonna go see my lawyer.

1810
02:16:53.793 --> 02:16:55.625
Hey.

1811
02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:57.026
Hey!

1812
02:16:57.092 --> 02:16:58.492
Hey. hey. hey!

1813
02:17:05.658 --> 02:17:06.925
Hey.

1814
02:17:06.992 --> 02:17:08.491
Hey!

1815
02:17:08.558 --> 02:17:09.658
Who the hell are you?

1816
02:17:09.759 --> 02:17:11.524
Whoa. whoa. hey!
No. hey!

1817
02:17:11.591 --> 02:17:13.358
What's--what's going on?

1818
02:17:17.158 --> 02:17:18.490
Get your hands off me!

1819
02:17:18.557 --> 02:17:22.057
Hey. come on!
Get your hands off--

1820
02:17:22.123 --> 02:17:23.657
- Good evening. Mr. Harris.

1821
02:17:23.757 --> 02:17:25.490
There's been a change of plans.

1822
02:17:25.556 --> 02:17:27.456
It's been decided that
you'll be placed at

1823
02:17:27.522 --> 02:17:29.890
a far more suitable
detention facility.

1824
02:17:29.957 --> 02:17:31.222
- What kind of facility?

1825
02:17:31.289 --> 02:17:33.422
- The Eichen.

1826
02:17:33.489 --> 02:17:35.122
- I think you'll be
very comfortable there.

1827
02:17:35.189 --> 02:17:36.555
- No. no. no. no. no. no.

1828
02:17:36.621 --> 02:17:39.256
No. God! No. no. no! No!

1829
02:17:39.321 --> 02:17:41.188
No! It's some kind of mistake!

1830
02:17:41.255 --> 02:17:43.355
No! I'm a high school teacher!

1831
02:17:43.421 --> 02:17:45.221
Come on. the kids.
the teenagers.

1832
02:17:45.288 --> 02:17:46.921
they're werewolves!

1833
02:17:46.988 --> 02:17:49.088
- Trust me.

1834
02:17:49.155 --> 02:17:52.454
We've heard plenty of stories
about teenage werewolves.

1835
02:17:54.554 --> 02:17:56.487
There's always a new one.

1836
02:18:16.786 --> 02:18:20.085
- Remember who you are.
