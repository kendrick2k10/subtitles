Oh wow. What is it?

10
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.645
She's an eastern water dragon.
They can grow up to 4ft.

11
00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:49.604
You can touch her.
Her name's Juliet.

12
00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:51.258
Has she ever bitten you?

13
00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:53.129
That was supposed
to be for Romeo.

14
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.523
He can be annoying. like
most boyfriends.

15
00:02:55.653 --> 00:02:58.265
Please. Mommy. can we go?

16
00:02:58.395 --> 00:03:01.181
Sweetie. 7 is too young to be
going to an anti-nuclear march.

17
00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:02.617
Oh. sorry.

18
00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:03.966
Did you let the puppies out?

19
00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:06.142
Excuse me. ma'am.
Do you have worms?

20
00:03:06.273 --> 00:03:08.536
They're for our dragons.
They're called Rocky and Mr T.

21
00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:10.451
What do they like the most -
dried or alive and wriggly?

22
00:03:10.581 --> 00:03:11.321
We have both just along here.

23
00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:12.801
It's not about that;

24
00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:14.629
it's about the men cutting down
our forests.

25
00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.108
Don't you know
what they're doing?

26
00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.023
- Honey. who told you that?
- Jodie did.

27
00:03:19.547 --> 00:03:20.461
Do you know how many
people live on the planet?

28
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:21.679
Uh. yes. no.

29
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.073
4.4 billion.

30
00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.161
- Rainin' Cats and Dogs.
- That's too many.

31
00:03:25.292 --> 00:03:27.032
How can I help you?

32
00:03:27.163 --> 00:03:29.165
Uh. yes. we have that.
Till... 5 today. OK.

33
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.388
Mommy. look.
He's done a peepee.

34
00:03:34.518 --> 00:03:35.650
Oh. sweetie.

35
00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:39.001
Jodie. could you please help
Mrs Martinez?

36
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:41.395
And when you're done.
can you start feeding the birds?

37
00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:43.135
Honey. please leave the puppies
in their pens. OK?

38
00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.441
Aw.

39
00:03:44.572 --> 00:03:46.095
Help! Jules?

40
00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:50.404
What are you doing?

41
00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:52.362
One of the
kids opened the cage.

42
00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:54.669
Damn Bertie got out again.
Can't get my arm under.

43
00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.279
He's way at the back.

44
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.628
You so owe me.

45
00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:02.851
- Yeah. he's right at the back.
- Yeah. I can see him. Hang on.

46
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:05.070
Got him.

47
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:06.246
Come here.

48
00:04:07.943 --> 00:04:10.119
Oh.
Aw. he's just a rat.

49
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.556
A cutie too.
Just put him away.

50
00:04:12.687 --> 00:04:14.515
One day. you'll find
the pythons. Bertie.

51
00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:16.560
and that won't end well.

52
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:20.129
Where is she now? We've really
gotta find another sitter.

53
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.826
Yeah. like we can
afford that

54
00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:23.698
You saw the letter
from the bank?

55
00:04:23.828 --> 00:04:26.004
Not overdrawn again?

56
00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:28.180
I'll go see them.
We'll find a way.

57
00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:31.009
Mom? I think Reggie's
eaten his brother.

58
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.794
Your turn. I did the puppy.

59
00:04:32.924 --> 00:04:34.578
- I did the rat.
- You did not!

60
00:04:39.017 --> 00:04:40.367
Oh. Reggie. You bad axolotl.

61
00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.068
Ew.

62
00:04:46.198 --> 00:04:48.636
Where's the lizard's
arms and legs?

63
00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:51.203
I'm guessing inside Reggie.
sweetie.

64
00:04:51.334 --> 00:04:53.118
- Ugh. that's gross.
- He's not a lizard.

65
00:04:54.903 --> 00:04:57.166
He's an amphibian. like some of
the oldest. baddest dinosaurs.

66
00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.863
Why did he do that?

67
00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:00.256
Mm. hungry. territorial.

68
00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:03.651
Or the water change.
They can be sensitive.

69
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:06.218
cos they breathe through
their skin. Look.

70
00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:07.350
So slimy.

71
00:05:09.396 --> 00:05:10.919
You know. if we took him
out of the water.

72
00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:13.182
he would turn into a salamander
and hunt on land.

73
00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.966
What would he hunt?

74
00:05:15.097 --> 00:05:16.620
I don't know.
Anything that moves.

75
00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:20.929
K.

76
00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:22.626
Damn filter's
gone again.

77
00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:25.586
Come on. Let's go tell Daddy
and see if he can fix it.

78
00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:26.282
You wanna come?
Mm-hm.

79
00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:27.979
OK.

80
00:05:29.372 --> 00:05:31.418
Thanks a lot.

81
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.600
Oh. I'm sorry. sir.
We're closed.

82
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.124
- I'm looking for Ben Adams.
- That's me. How can I help?

83
00:05:42.254 --> 00:05:44.474
Amos Tilbury.

84
00:05:44.605 --> 00:05:47.347
I wanted to talk to you
about your mother.

85
00:05:47.477 --> 00:05:49.392
Uh. Ben's mother passed
away a few months ago.

86
00:05:49.523 --> 00:05:51.351
I know. My apologies.

87
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:53.570
My partner was her lawyer...

88
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:55.616
before his stroke - poor guy.

89
00:05:55.746 --> 00:05:58.358
Um. I've been trying to
go through his old files.

90
00:05:58.488 --> 00:06:00.751
but if now is inconvenient.
I can come back.

91
00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:02.884
No. uh...

92
00:06:03.014 --> 00:06:04.625
I'm sorry.
This is my wife. Jules.

93
00:06:04.755 --> 00:06:06.104
- Hi.
- Hi.

94
00:06:06.235 --> 00:06:07.758
Uh. do you wanna
come through and sit?

95
00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.456
Sure.

96
00:06:14.156 --> 00:06:15.200
Excuse the mess.

97
00:06:15.331 --> 00:06:17.420
Uh. we live in the
apartment above.

98
00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:20.423
Ben's renovating
the kitchen upstairs.

99
00:06:20.554 --> 00:06:22.251
UC Davis.
I hear it's a good programme.

100
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.253
Yeah. Last year of vet school.

101
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.821
It's a bit stressful
on top of everything else.

102
00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:28.997
but we are hoping to open
a practice as part of the store.

103
00:06:29.127 --> 00:06:30.825
- Hm.
- Yeah.

104
00:06:30.955 --> 00:06:33.741
Um. you said something
about my mother's files.

105
00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:36.396
Yeah. I... I didn't
know your mother.

106
00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:39.703
And. uh. everything in her file
appears to be in order.

107
00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:41.879
There was. however.
an old deed I came across

108
00:06:43.794 --> 00:06:45.970
emptying some boxes that
had been filed incorrectly.

109
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:48.582
It's for a coastal property
in Oregon.

110
00:06:48.712 --> 00:06:50.410
My mother never
had property anywhere.

111
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.150
- Mm.
- Certainly not up there.

112
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:55.676
Well. it's from 1935.
in your father's name.

113
00:06:55.806 --> 00:06:57.634
He bought land on
the Oregon coast

114
00:06:57.765 --> 00:06:59.810
at the end of the Depression.

115
00:06:59.941 --> 00:07:02.291
little place called
Hobbit's Bay.

116
00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.119
Never heard of it.

117
00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:09.341
How did something like this
get overlooked for so long?

118
00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:13.128
Well. it was before
our firm's time. and...

119
00:07:13.258 --> 00:07:16.348
well. we had no record on file
of your mother ever owning it.

120
00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:19.177
But it would have
passed on to her.

121
00:07:19.308 --> 00:07:22.224
Looks like it got forgotten
after your father's death.

122
00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:26.663
Isn't that a little bit
strange? I mean.

123
00:07:26.794 --> 00:07:28.883
people don't normally forget
about a place they own. do they?

124
00:07:29.013 --> 00:07:30.711
Well. some families
have secrets.

125
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.104
You'd be surprised
at what people find out

126
00:07:33.235 --> 00:07:34.454
after a loved one dies.

127
00:07:36.717 --> 00:07:38.980
In all my life. she never
once mentioned this.

128
00:07:41.112 --> 00:07:42.636
Can I keep all of this?
Of course.

129
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.641
I appreciate you coming by.

130
00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:49.207
Look- Look.
I don't mean to pry.

131
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.340
There was one
other thing I found.

132
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.693
Are you aware of what happened
to your father?

133
00:07:56.824 --> 00:07:58.478
He and my sister died in a car
accident just before I was born.

134
00:07:58.608 --> 00:08:00.480
Why?

135
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.830
Well. according to this.

136
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.963
they were swimming at Hobbit's
Bay when they disappeared.

137
00:08:07.617 --> 00:08:08.879
My mother never spoke
about them much.

138
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.141
She never wanted to. Um...

139
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.885
But why would she say it was
a car accident if it wasn't?

140
00:08:15.016 --> 00:08:16.278
Well. Ben's mother
was institutionalised

141
00:08:16.408 --> 00:08:17.540
for most of his childhood.

142
00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:20.587
She was never around much.

143
00:08:20.717 --> 00:08:22.545
Sorry. I just thought
you should know.

144
00:08:24.852 --> 00:08:26.941
Legally. the property's yours
to do with as you wish.

145
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:29.117
I do have a local agent
who can help advise.

146
00:08:31.336 --> 00:08:33.208
What do you wanna do?

147
00:08:36.646 --> 00:08:38.822
- Well. how far away is it?
- Well. it's quite a drive -

148
00:08:38.953 --> 00:08:42.783
halfway up the Oregon coast.
just north of Florence.

149
00:08:42.913 --> 00:08:45.437
I could get my office to
give you the directions.

150
00:09:41.537 --> 00:09:42.712
Are you sure
this is it?

151
00:09:42.843 --> 00:09:44.018
Oh yeah.

152
00:10:05.343 --> 00:10:07.041
Are we there yet?

153
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:08.433
Almost. sweetie.

154
00:10:15.832 --> 00:10:17.312
You sure this is safe?

155
00:10:17.442 --> 00:10:19.009
We'll soon find out.

156
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.489
Hold on.

157
00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:40.596
Now what?

158
00:10:40.727 --> 00:10:42.380
I'll take a look.

159
00:11:10.887 --> 00:11:11.888
Hey. there's something
through here.

160
00:11:15.065 --> 00:11:16.806
Archie.

161
00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:19.896
Archie! Come here!

162
00:11:28.513 --> 00:11:29.863
Oh wow.

163
00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:33.823
It's a palace.
All my dreams have come true

164
00:11:35.869 --> 00:11:37.131
Do you think it has power?

165
00:11:41.918 --> 00:11:43.659
Sure. How do you think
you heat the Jacuzzi

166
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.011
OK. stand back.
This is a dad job.

167
00:12:35.842 --> 00:12:36.843
Well. a little bit more
air and light -

168
00:12:36.973 --> 00:12:38.148
I think it's got potential.

169
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:42.022
Hey. slow down.

170
00:12:48.985 --> 00:12:50.857
What's in here?

171
00:12:54.643 --> 00:12:56.514
Can we go upstairs?

172
00:12:56.645 --> 00:12:58.429
Sure.

173
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.040
Come on. Archie. Come with me.

174
00:13:01.955 --> 00:13:03.217
Hey. be careful. Some of the
floorboards might be rotten.

175
00:13:03.347 --> 00:13:04.914
OK.

176
00:13:20.147 --> 00:13:21.757
Wow.

177
00:13:51.047 --> 00:13:52.657
Hey. can you give me
a hand with this?

178
00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:55.573
Oh. don't worry. I got it.

179
00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:07.237
Ben? Quick. come here.

180
00:14:09.544 --> 00:14:10.937
What is it?

181
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.113
You all right?

182
00:14:14.331 --> 00:14:15.376
Look at this.

183
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:22.687
It's incredible.

184
00:14:31.044 --> 00:14:32.654
Didn't I say things
would work out?

185
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.396
I love you.

186
00:14:49.018 --> 00:14:50.367
[STONE COVER SCRAPES. THUD!

187
00:14:53.066 --> 00:14:55.024
What is it?

188
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.419
It looks disgusting.

189
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:02.510
It's a water tank.

190
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.860
All these old types of places
would've run off rainwater

191
00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:08.211
or a bore. if there's an
underground spring near here.

192
00:15:08.342 --> 00:15:09.560
You're not going in there.

193
00:15:11.693 --> 00:15:12.912
- It's just a water tank.
- Ben!

194
00:15:15.044 --> 00:15:16.654
Hey. Come here. Come here.

195
00:15:44.813 --> 00:15:46.032
'Ben? Ben!

196
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:48.904
'What can you see?'

197
00:15:49.035 --> 00:15:50.427
Not much.

198
00:16:08.402 --> 00:16:10.056
What's that?

199
00:16:10.186 --> 00:16:12.014
Just an old lantern
I found in the dirt.

200
00:16:19.195 --> 00:16:21.110
Can I go in there?

201
00:16:21.241 --> 00:16:23.069
Sweetie. I don't want you
to go near this thing. OK?

202
00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:24.853
Promise me?

203
00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.115
- Promise.
- Yeah. good girl.

204
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:29.162
Go and help Mom.

205
00:17:22.693 --> 00:17:24.217
Honey! Where
do you want our bags?

206
00:17:24.347 --> 00:17:25.870
I got pillows and blankets too.

207
00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:31.180
Uh. up here. I think
this is your parents' old room.

208
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:38.709
What are these?

209
00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:42.844
Mm. Must be Granny's.

210
00:17:51.287 --> 00:17:52.593
Was this her?

211
00:17:52.723 --> 00:17:54.638
She was beautiful.

212
00:17:54.769 --> 00:17:57.163
Yeah. she was.

213
00:17:57.293 --> 00:17:59.861
And that little girl would've
been your Aunt Rosie.

214
00:18:08.957 --> 00:18:10.306
I think this is jammed.

215
00:18:10.437 --> 00:18:11.481
It won't open.

216
00:18:11.612 --> 00:18:13.962
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

217
00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:16.617
Oh yeah.
Someone's nailed them shut.

218
00:18:16.747 --> 00:18:19.359
Probably just thought the place
would've been broken into.

219
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:29.978
Sugar and Meg-Meg want
to know where their room is.

220
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.154
Well. I saw a very special
room downstairs.

221
00:18:32.285 --> 00:18:33.590
Shall we go check it out?
Mm-hm.

222
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.419
All right. come on. Jump on.

223
00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:41.163
Downstairs. Giddy up!

224
00:18:41.294 --> 00:18:42.295
Yeehaw!

225
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:44.993

I don't know.

245
00:20:25.572 --> 00:20:27.008
Could be.

246
00:20:28.575 --> 00:20:29.967
Check this out.

247
00:20:31.969 --> 00:20:34.233
It's a bunch of news clippings
about the area.

248
00:20:35.103 --> 00:20:37.540
What do they mean?

249
00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:40.282
I don't know. I got dozens
more. They're all similar.

250
00:20:42.589 --> 00:20:44.243
I mean. there's an
insurance claim here

251
00:20:44.373 --> 00:20:47.463
for another ship that ran
aground in the early 1900s.

252
00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:48.812
This one says some
of the crew went ashore

253
00:20:48.943 --> 00:20:50.074
and were never seen again.

254
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.427
Look at this.

255
00:20:55.645 --> 00:20:58.344
I found them
in your mother's room.

256
00:20:58.474 --> 00:21:01.912
They're reports of
your father and sister.

257
00:21:02.043 --> 00:21:06.047
Tilbury was right. According to
these. they did drown here.

258
00:21:06.177 --> 00:21:08.005
but their bodies were
never recovered.

259
00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:22.542
They suspected her?

260
00:21:23.978 --> 00:21:25.762
That doesn't make any sense.
I mean...

261
00:21:27.024 --> 00:21:28.287
she was secretive...

262
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:30.854
a bit crazy. sure. but...

263
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.432
You should see your face.

264
00:21:46.609 --> 00:21:47.828
You think my mom's a psycho.

265
00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:50.221
Uh...

266
00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:52.311
- Maybe it runs in the family.
- Oh. shut up.

267
00:21:53.268 --> 00:21:55.096
What was that noise?

268
00:21:55.226 --> 00:21:56.402
- Nothing. sweetie. Just-
- I'll clear this away.

269
00:21:56.532 --> 00:21:57.577
It's just the wind. OK?

270
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.537
Come on. Off to beddy-byes.

271
00:22:01.668 --> 00:22:03.974
Come here.

272
00:22:04.105 --> 00:22:06.890
- Goodnight. Daddy.
- Goodnight. angel. Sleep tight.

273
00:22:09.458 --> 00:22:11.895
Come on.

274
00:22:31.045 --> 00:22:32.655
OK. here we go.

275
00:22:35.179 --> 00:22:36.398
Who's that?

276
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:37.660
That's you.

277
00:22:38.705 --> 00:22:40.271
- This is Daddy.
- Mm.

278
00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:42.056
That's Grandma.

279
00:22:42.186 --> 00:22:44.406
I miss her.

280
00:22:44.537 --> 00:22:45.755
I know. sweetie. We do too.

281
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.410
But she's in a better place now.

282
00:22:49.803 --> 00:22:52.153
Can you read
Wind in the Willows to me?

283
00:22:52.283 --> 00:22:56.157
Just for a few minutes.
Who's your favourite this week?

284
00:22:56.287 --> 00:22:59.334
Badger. He's so grumpy.

285
00:22:59.465 --> 00:23:00.683
No. wait. I like Toady.
He's the funniest.

286
00:23:00.814 --> 00:23:02.381
Yeah?

287
00:23:03.817 --> 00:23:05.688
'Like Summer Tempests
Came His Tears.

288
00:23:06.907 --> 00:23:09.388
'The Rat put out
a neat. brown paw.

289
00:23:09.518 --> 00:23:11.781
'gripped Toad firmly by
the scruff of his neck...'

290
00:23:39.722 --> 00:23:41.115
She's asleep.

291
00:23:43.073 --> 00:23:45.511
What you looking at?

292
00:23:45.641 --> 00:23:48.078
Found it downstairs.
It's your mother's diary.

293
00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:57.348
Yeah. this is her handwriting.

294
00:23:57.479 --> 00:23:59.960
She used to write me from
hospital when I was a kid.

295
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.441
- She never remarried?
- No. Never saw anyone.

296
00:24:04.704 --> 00:24:06.880
She used to say when Dad
and Rosie died that it was fate.

297
00:24:09.404 --> 00:24:11.928
To God. be grateful for what
you've got. and all that.

298
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.564
Well. I think you're doing
a hell of a better job.

299
00:24:40.653 --> 00:24:43.917
You know. it's strange
when your parents die.

300
00:24:44.047 --> 00:24:47.398
You start thinking about
them differently. like...

301
00:24:47.529 --> 00:24:49.792
how they were to you.
the decisions they made.

302
00:24:51.185 --> 00:24:52.360
How youare to your own child.

303
00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:55.145
How you'll never do
what they did.

304
00:24:57.844 --> 00:24:59.498
What do you wanna do
about this place?

305
00:25:01.108 --> 00:25:02.501
We could really use the money.

306
00:25:03.893 --> 00:25:05.678
And it's fuckingcreepy.

307
00:25:05.808 --> 00:25:07.157
It is!

308
00:25:07.288 --> 00:25:08.507
Yeah. well... it is.

309
00:25:10.857 --> 00:25:13.294
I mean. this place
was so special to them.

310
00:25:13.424 --> 00:25:17.211
Why didn't she want me to know?

311
00:25:17.341 --> 00:25:19.605
Thought you would never ask.
Let's find out.

312
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.738
'April 27th. 1946.

313
00:25:24.348 --> 00:25:26.307
'We have moved in.

314
00:25:26.437 --> 00:25:27.961
'and I am my new self again.'
LINDA... my new self again.

315
00:25:28.091 --> 00:25:30.006
with none of my dark sadness.

316
00:25:34.141 --> 00:25:36.317
It is just the
beginning of our new life here

317
00:25:36.447 --> 00:25:38.841
with Rosie. and our child
grows strong inside of me.

318
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:43.977
Alec is determined
we be comfortable here

319
00:25:44.107 --> 00:25:47.676
and has had a man come in
and build a water tank.

320
00:25:47.807 --> 00:25:50.636
And this week. they drilled
more than a hundred feet

321
00:25:50.766 --> 00:25:53.421
to the deep spring
that has water

322
00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:56.555
sweeter and more nourishing
than any I have ever tasted.

323
00:26:03.605 --> 00:26:06.347
A package arrived today.
completely anonymously.

324
00:26:10.699 --> 00:26:13.702
It contained newspaper reports
about our bay.

325
00:26:13.833 --> 00:26:16.270
Alec told me to throw them away.

326
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.837
that someone is not happy
we are here

327
00:26:17.967 --> 00:26:19.316
and is trying to unsettle us.

328
00:26:28.151 --> 00:26:30.023
Alec was up all night
with the storm again.

329
00:26:30.153 --> 00:26:32.329
When it cleared.

330
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.942
Rosie and I took our
early stroll along the beach.

331
00:26:36.072 --> 00:26:38.031
He was not there
for his early morning swim.

332
00:26:39.815 --> 00:26:42.862
And when we returned.
I could not find him anywhere.

333
00:26:47.997 --> 00:26:49.477
He has been gone
for three days.

334
00:26:51.348 --> 00:26:54.047
I alerted the local police. but
they assure me he will return

335
00:26:54.177 --> 00:26:55.309
from wherever he has gone.

336
00:26:57.093 --> 00:26:59.400
Rosie misses
her father terribly.

337
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.054
and I fear for his safety.

338
00:27:03.578 --> 00:27:04.797
'May 5th. 1946.'

339
00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:09.149
That's the last entry.
The rest is missing.

340
00:27:14.284 --> 00:27:16.983
Rosie disappeared
on the night of May 10th.

341
00:27:17.113 --> 00:27:18.637
What happened
in those five days?

342
00:27:24.381 --> 00:27:25.644
What's the matter? You don't
wanna know what happened?

343
00:27:25.774 --> 00:27:27.167
Oh. this is just so crazy.
You know?

344
00:27:27.297 --> 00:27:28.559
This is her all over again.
She-She-

345
00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.909
She never told me the truth.

346
00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:33.303
Never. Never what
I wanted to know.

347
00:27:33.434 --> 00:27:34.522
Now I have to accept that.

348
00:27:37.743 --> 00:27:40.049
I don't know why
she did what she did

349
00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.834
or what even really
happened. but...

350
00:27:43.139 --> 00:27:44.575
she's gone now.
and I never will.

351
00:27:46.273 --> 00:27:49.319
- You're not slightly curious?
- What difference does it make?

352
00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:50.669
She did what she did.

353
00:29:53.748 --> 00:29:54.880
Mommy.

354
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.229
Sweetie.

355
00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.623
Something's trying to get in.

356
00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:36.312
'Stay here. OK?

357
00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:40.229
'Ben. Get up.'

358
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.166
'What is it?'

359
00:31:07.126 --> 00:31:08.910
I-I don't know.
I'm still on the stairs.

360
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:10.433
Go back to bed.

361
00:34:55.005 --> 00:34:57.617
Shit!

362
00:34:57.747 --> 00:35:00.185
Don't do that.
You'll give me a heart attack.

363
00:35:00.315 --> 00:35:01.664
The terrace
door doesn't shut properly.

364
00:35:01.795 --> 00:35:03.362
-Oh my God.
- What are you doing?

365
00:35:03.492 --> 00:35:05.581
Nothing. I'm...
I thought I heard something.

366
00:35:05.712 --> 00:35:06.974
Let's go to sleep.

367
00:35:08.062 --> 00:35:09.107
Don't dothat. You just...

368
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:12.545
scared the livin' days
out of me.

369
00:35:14.068 --> 00:35:16.070
- It's funny.
- It's not funny.

370
00:35:58.634 --> 00:35:59.853
♪ Sometimes lovin'...

371
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:02.943
♪ is so. so hard

372
00:36:03.073 --> 00:36:04.510
♪ to do.

373
00:36:25.792 --> 00:36:27.794
Hey! You're up.

374
00:36:27.924 --> 00:36:30.927
I didn't wanna wake you. Thought
you could do with the sleep.

375
00:36:31.058 --> 00:36:33.495
Fridge is running. Hungry?

376
00:36:33.626 --> 00:36:36.368
No.
I can't believe I slept in.

377
00:36:36.498 --> 00:36:37.891
What's all that?
Oh. it's just junk -

378
00:36:38.021 --> 00:36:40.589
old tools. lots of fertiliser.

379
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.939
We should keep Reia outta here.
It's high ammonium nitrate -

380
00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.680
what they used to make
bombs with in World War II.

381
00:36:44.811 --> 00:36:47.248
Even some old fuse wires
still here.

382
00:36:47.379 --> 00:36:48.641
Found some old gas.
but we're gonna need more.

383
00:36:48.771 --> 00:36:51.774
so I'm gonna head back
to that station tomorrow.

384
00:36:51.905 --> 00:36:53.341
What? What is it?

385
00:36:55.952 --> 00:36:57.998
Doesn't this place
make you feel uneasy?

386
00:36:59.739 --> 00:37:00.696
Well. first night in a new
place is always a bit weird.

387
00:37:02.437 --> 00:37:05.832
but that may be because I woke
up with Meg-Meg staring at me

388
00:37:05.962 --> 00:37:07.181
with her creepy one eye...

389
00:37:07.312 --> 00:37:09.270
...and a unicorn up my nose.

390
00:37:09.401 --> 00:37:11.098
Could be that.

391
00:37:21.978 --> 00:37:24.154
Why don't we just call
someone to come in and fix it?

392
00:37:24.285 --> 00:37:25.721
It could be just a shut valve.

393
00:37:27.767 --> 00:37:30.204
It's actually
quite nice in here.

394
00:37:30.335 --> 00:37:32.554
- Are you sure about this?
- Can't be that hard. right?

395
00:37:32.685 --> 00:37:33.903
Wish me luck.

396
00:37:59.712 --> 00:38:01.931
Well. it looks like it goes a
long way back under the cottage.

397
00:38:04.804 --> 00:38:07.850
If there are any monsters or
psychos. don't let them out. OK?

398
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:09.504
You bet. honey.

399
00:38:09.635 --> 00:38:11.027
Damn things.

400
00:38:12.028 --> 00:38:13.552
Agh!
What can you see?

401
00:38:17.556 --> 00:38:19.688
There's a pipe coming in
from the hill behind

402
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.604
and another below
that must go to the pump.

403
00:38:22.735 --> 00:38:24.171
Hang on.
I'll see if I can open it.

404
00:38:33.833 --> 00:38:34.834
Ow. Shit.

405
00:38:47.412 --> 00:38:48.935
It works!

406
00:38:49.065 --> 00:38:50.458
We've got water!

407
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:56.116
Damn it.

408
00:40:09.494 --> 00:40:12.061
Any luck?

409
00:40:12.192 --> 00:40:15.891
Oh. Did you hurt yourself?
Uh. it's just a scratch.

410
00:40:16.022 --> 00:40:19.547
Found a tunnel and a sort of
cave behind the tank wall.

411
00:40:19.678 --> 00:40:21.680
Looks really deep. Must be
where the water comes from.

412
00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:23.377
Oh!

413
00:40:23.508 --> 00:40:24.726
Great. Pump still works.

414
00:40:26.946 --> 00:40:28.513
Oh.

415
00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:38.740
Pure spring water.

416
00:40:38.871 --> 00:40:41.047
Maybe we should start bottling
it. Could be a new thing.

417
00:40:41.177 --> 00:40:42.831
OK. let's not. uh.
close the store just yet.

418
00:40:45.791 --> 00:40:47.009
Look what else I found.

419
00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.839
Oh.

420
00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:57.759
Where did you find this?

421
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.108
It was in the mud.
in the tank.

422
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:01.981
What do you think it is?

423
00:41:02.111 --> 00:41:04.636
Well. it's not a fish.

424
00:41:04.766 --> 00:41:07.465
It's some sort of amphibious
larvae - not fully formed.

425
00:41:10.206 --> 00:41:11.381
These are its gills.
Yeah?

426
00:41:13.296 --> 00:41:14.907
See the rear bone spurs?

427
00:41:15.037 --> 00:41:17.518
They turn into legs
when they move on to land.

428
00:41:17.649 --> 00:41:19.085
Look how slimy it is.
Like. look.

429
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:21.653
Oh. yeah.

430
00:41:21.783 --> 00:41:23.785
Wow.

431
00:41:27.354 --> 00:41:28.398
Holy shit.

432
00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:32.490
- What's that?
- Hm?

433
00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:36.581
It's solid. That's where
its eyes should be.

434
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:40.759
Maybe it's subterranean -
evolved not to need them.

435
00:41:40.889 --> 00:41:42.108
like Apoda amphibians.

436
00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:47.069
- What does 'Apoda' mean?
- Uh. 'the blind ones' in Latin.

437
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.376
Do you know how devilishly
sexy you are

438
00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:51.204
when you speak Latin?
I do. actually.

439
00:41:53.946 --> 00:41:55.643
What do you think
it's doing here?

440
00:41:55.774 --> 00:41:59.038
I don't know. Maybe it's
attracted to the water.

441
00:41:59.168 --> 00:42:02.041
It's pretty incredible.
Pretty frickin' weird.

442
00:42:02.171 --> 00:42:05.044
What do we do with it?
Mm. we should try preserve it.

443
00:42:05.174 --> 00:42:06.872
Someone will wanna
study this thing for sure.

444
00:42:07.002 --> 00:42:08.221
Where's that cooler?

445
00:42:08.874 --> 00:42:10.571
Oh. there.

446
00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:14.967
OK. but you better win an award
for discovering this thing.

447
00:42:15.097 --> 00:42:16.969
whatever the hell it is.

448
00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:18.797
cos that was my lucky
Led Zeppelin shirt.

449
00:42:18.927 --> 00:42:21.451
I'll buy you a new one
when I'm famous.

450
00:42:51.307 --> 00:42:53.005
Hello?

451
00:42:53.135 --> 00:42:55.181
Daddy?

452
00:42:59.577 --> 00:43:00.795
Is anyone in there?

453
00:43:04.625 --> 00:43:06.845
Daddy?

454
00:43:18.247 --> 00:43:19.640
Ah. Mommy!

455
00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:23.122
What is it? Are you hurt?

456
00:43:24.384 --> 00:43:27.126
There's something in the tank.

457
00:43:27.256 --> 00:43:29.694
Why is this open?
She could've fallen.

458
00:43:29.824 --> 00:43:32.261
It sounded like the one
in my room last night.

459
00:43:32.392 --> 00:43:34.133
What do you mean.
in your room?

460
00:43:34.263 --> 00:43:36.091
Honey. there's a lot of
animals in the wild here.

461
00:43:36.222 --> 00:43:38.572
Please. I told you
not to look in there.

462
00:43:38.703 --> 00:43:39.878
Probably just the sound
of the water pipe.

463
00:43:40.008 --> 00:43:41.706
Hello? Is anyone home?

464
00:43:43.708 --> 00:43:46.449
So sorry. Th-The
front door was open.

465
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:48.930
I'm Merial Tingey. Mr Tilbury
asked me to come and see you

466
00:43:49.061 --> 00:43:51.629
about selling the property.
I couldn't call.

467
00:43:51.759 --> 00:43:53.108
I hope now's OK.

468
00:43:53.239 --> 00:43:55.067
Uh...

469
00:43:55.197 --> 00:43:57.460
'course. I'm Ben.

470
00:43:57.591 --> 00:44:00.725
This is Jules and Reia.
Glad you found us.

471
00:44:00.855 --> 00:44:03.075
It's a bit of a hike. isn't
it? I thought I might get stuck.

472
00:44:03.205 --> 00:44:05.033
so I left my car at the top
and walked down.

473
00:44:05.164 --> 00:44:07.166
I saw you from the hill.

474
00:44:07.296 --> 00:44:08.036
Do you wanna go
upstairs and play

475
00:44:08.167 --> 00:44:09.211
while we talk to the lady?

476
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:16.697
I remember my father
coming here years ago

477
00:44:16.828 --> 00:44:18.830
with a buyer.

478
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.180
But your mother's lawyer
was adamant she'd never sell.

479
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:22.442
It truly is a magical spot.

480
00:44:23.269 --> 00:44:25.619
Yeah.

481
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:28.709
It's a gorgeous beach.
Well. not just the beach.

482
00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.537
You realise the property extends
a lot further than that -

483
00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:32.539
several private coves.

484
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.715
most of those hills
in the distance as well.

485
00:44:36.325 --> 00:44:38.066
Well. we only learned
about the place last week.

486
00:44:38.197 --> 00:44:39.372
It's the last remaining
untouched block of its size

487
00:44:39.502 --> 00:44:41.896
up here. From what I can recall.

488
00:44:42.027 --> 00:44:43.506
I believe the cottage
was originally built

489
00:44:43.637 --> 00:44:46.335
as a whaler's shack
in the early 1800s.

490
00:44:46.466 --> 00:44:48.947
Uh. do you know who owned
the place before Ben's parents?

491
00:44:49.077 --> 00:44:51.776
I don't. May have
even been abandoned.

492
00:44:51.906 --> 00:44:54.517
There were a lot of protests
when he bought it -

493
00:44:54.648 --> 00:44:57.825
locals especially. They thought
the place was cursed. but...

494
00:44:57.956 --> 00:44:59.740
I'm sorry about what
happened to him.

495
00:45:01.307 --> 00:45:03.048
Uh. you said curse.
What do you mean by that?

496
00:45:03.178 --> 00:45:05.137
Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

497
00:45:05.267 --> 00:45:07.879
Uh. the big Cascadia
earthquake in 1700.

498
00:45:08.009 --> 00:45:09.576
It hit from Canada
down to California.

499
00:45:09.707 --> 00:45:11.404
This coast was
completely torn open -

500
00:45:11.534 --> 00:45:14.059
sent a tsunami
all the way to Japan.

501
00:45:14.189 --> 00:45:16.365
The Siuslaw people
said the land was bad

502
00:45:16.496 --> 00:45:18.498
and abandoned the whole area.

503
00:45:18.628 --> 00:45:20.108
Theysaid it was cursed.
Said. uh...

504
00:45:22.067 --> 00:45:24.330
the ground opened up deep.
and people would disappear.

505
00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.724
It's just a silly old story.
Places have them.

506
00:45:29.117 --> 00:45:30.945
I'm sorry. I hope you don't
think this presumptuous;

507
00:45:31.076 --> 00:45:32.947
I made a few calls
before I came. and. uh...

508
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.037
well. I have a buyer
who's interested.

509
00:45:36.168 --> 00:45:37.343
They've made a strong offer
and would move quickly.

510
00:45:37.473 --> 00:45:38.648
if you wanted.

511
00:45:38.779 --> 00:45:39.998
Oh. that's fast.

512
00:45:44.916 --> 00:45:47.745
There may be a little room
to go up... for a quick sale.

513
00:45:47.875 --> 00:45:50.399
- Oh. this is a lot.
- Is that serious?

514
00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:51.270
It's a lot more than I think
your mother ever thought

515
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.098
it'd be worth.

516
00:45:53.228 --> 00:45:53.881
And if you want more. I can ask-
No. No.

517
00:45:54.012 --> 00:45:56.623
Yes. Yes!

518
00:45:56.754 --> 00:45:58.494
The buyer's in town
and keen to close a deal.

519
00:45:58.625 --> 00:46:00.061
so if you have time
to meet. then...

520
00:46:01.497 --> 00:46:03.282
well...

521
00:46:03.412 --> 00:46:05.327
my number's on there.

522
00:46:05.458 --> 00:46:07.155
You'll wanna talk.
a-a-and no rush.

523
00:46:08.896 --> 00:46:10.811
Sorry.

524
00:46:10.942 --> 00:46:12.900
Thank you.

525
00:46:13.031 --> 00:46:15.337
Can I give you a lift
back up to your car?

526
00:46:15.468 --> 00:46:18.079
Thank you. but. you know.
I think I'll enjoy the walk.

527
00:47:54.436 --> 00:47:55.873
Oh. wha-?

528
00:48:42.006 --> 00:48:43.224
Ben? Are you awake?

529
00:48:44.834 --> 00:48:45.792
I'm asleep.

530
00:48:45.923 --> 00:48:48.142
Shh.

531
00:48:48.273 --> 00:48:49.317
I think I hear something.

532
00:48:50.666 --> 00:48:52.016
That.

533
00:50:04.958 --> 00:50:06.916
What's going on? You OK?

534
00:50:07.047 --> 00:50:08.962
I-I just saw something
at the window.

535
00:50:11.138 --> 00:50:12.618
What?

536
00:50:12.748 --> 00:50:14.141
O-Over there.

537
00:50:17.231 --> 00:50:18.580
You sure?
There's nothing there.

538
00:50:18.711 --> 00:50:21.496
Yes. Yes. I'm goddamn sure.
It had big teeth and claws.

539
00:50:21.627 --> 00:50:23.455
It was right there.

540
00:50:23.585 --> 00:50:25.457
It was probably just a raccoon
attracted to the light.

541
00:50:25.587 --> 00:50:28.068
- That was no fucking raccoon.
- OK. just calm down.

542
00:50:29.852 --> 00:50:32.464
OK? I don't wanna scare Reia.
There's nothing out there. OK?

543
00:50:32.594 --> 00:50:34.161
I-I just want us to go.
I just want us to leave.

544
00:50:37.164 --> 00:50:39.993
Look. I'll call Merial
tomorrow and meet the buyer.

545
00:50:40.124 --> 00:50:41.995
We can sell it in the next day
or two and never come back.

546
00:50:42.126 --> 00:50:43.301
OK?

547
00:51:24.864 --> 00:51:26.605
Come on.

548
00:51:32.567 --> 00:51:33.786
Oh. come on.

549
00:52:00.943 --> 00:52:02.336
Ah. shit.

550
00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.782
What are you doing?

551
00:54:23.912 --> 00:54:25.349
I thought you were going
to the gas station.

552
00:54:25.479 --> 00:54:26.915
Go inside and play. sweetie.

553
00:54:29.004 --> 00:54:31.398
Have you seen Archie?
He came up from the beach.

554
00:54:31.529 --> 00:54:32.530
Uh. maybe he's around back.
I'll have a look when I go.

555
00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:33.792
- SIGHS: OK.
- Look at this.

556
00:54:35.881 --> 00:54:37.883
Found your intruder.
It's just a raccoon.

557
00:54:39.537 --> 00:54:41.582
Must've got in under the house
somehow and drowned.

558
00:54:41.713 --> 00:54:42.888
That's what all the noise
would've been.

559
00:54:43.018 --> 00:54:44.281
Poor little guy.

560
00:54:47.022 --> 00:54:48.285
Look what else I found.

561
00:54:50.156 --> 00:54:51.505
You see what's tangled in it?

562
00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:41.860
I think we need to
call the police.

563
00:55:43.165 --> 00:55:45.429
They need to look down there.

564
00:55:45.559 --> 00:55:46.865
I'm gonna go to
the gas station.

565
00:56:19.506 --> 00:56:21.421
The Badger drew himself up.

566
00:56:21.552 --> 00:56:24.642
took a firm grip with his stick
with both paws.

567
00:56:24.772 --> 00:56:27.253
glanced around his
comrades and cried.

568
00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:29.603
'The hour has come.
Follow me.'

569
00:56:29.734 --> 00:56:31.300
and flung the trap door
wide open.

570
00:56:32.258 --> 00:56:34.086
They were but four in all.

571
00:56:34.216 --> 00:56:35.783
but to the panic-stricken
weasels.

572
00:56:35.914 --> 00:56:38.046
the hall seemed full of
monstrous animals.

573
00:56:40.788 --> 00:56:42.573
- No. more!
- We can read again tomorrow.

574
00:56:46.141 --> 00:56:48.187
It's early. Do we have to?

575
00:56:48.317 --> 00:56:49.754
Afraid so. beautiful.

576
00:58:43.345 --> 00:58:44.564
Hello? Is anybody there?

577
00:58:46.131 --> 00:58:48.350
Hello? Anybody?

578
00:58:50.265 --> 00:58:51.484
Hello?

579
01:01:49.967 --> 01:01:52.665
Reia!

580
01:02:14.687 --> 01:02:15.906
Come on.

581
01:02:16.036 --> 01:02:17.995
Come on!

582
01:02:19.823 --> 01:02:21.389
Reia!

583
01:02:40.713 --> 01:02:42.280
Reia!

584
01:02:45.936 --> 01:02:46.980
Jules?

585
01:02:50.462 --> 01:02:52.464
Jules!

586
01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:53.987
Where are you?

587
01:02:55.293 --> 01:02:57.512
Jules!

588
01:02:57.643 --> 01:03:00.037
Up here!

589
01:03:00.167 --> 01:03:02.387
- Are you all right?
- The tank lid was open.

590
01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:04.998
Something came into the cottage.
We need to leave.

591
01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:11.265
-What is it?
- Merial. the estate agent.

592
01:03:11.396 --> 01:03:13.920
She's dead.
Something attacked her.

593
01:03:14.051 --> 01:03:15.661
I radioed the sheriff.
They're sending someone.

594
01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.445
They said to lock the doors
and wait for them.

595
01:03:17.576 --> 01:03:19.621
We should. uh-
We should get Reia dressed.

596
01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:25.410
I found out what happened
to your father and sister.

597
01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.499
They didn't drown at the beach.

598
01:03:27.629 --> 01:03:29.370
They died here. in the cottage.

599
01:03:33.113 --> 01:03:35.724
There's something
in this place.

600
01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:37.857
That's why no one lives here.
why your mother never told you

601
01:03:37.988 --> 01:03:39.772
about it. She never wanted you
to know. to evercome here.

602
01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:44.777
She lied to the police.

603
01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:47.258
She made the whole thing up
about them drowning.

604
01:03:50.609 --> 01:03:51.828
It's the rest of her diary.

605
01:03:53.742 --> 01:03:56.049
'I trust in God
I make it away from here

606
01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:58.747
'and out of this hell and my
poor family can be found.'

607
01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:00.793
Mommy!

608
01:04:02.751 --> 01:04:04.623
She wasn't crazy
like they thought.

609
01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:07.365
No. She thought they'd take
you away if she told the truth.

610
01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:09.062
And the last thing
she wrote was...

611
01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:12.152
'Whoever finds this.
forgive me.'...

612
01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.676
and this.

613
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:20.639
-Where are we going?
- Just for a drive. sweetie.

614
01:04:20.769 --> 01:04:22.510
Just wait here
with Mommy.

615
01:04:22.641 --> 01:04:23.207
That's the sheriff.
I'll go get him.

616
01:04:23.337 --> 01:04:25.426
Hey. wait!

617
01:04:27.515 --> 01:04:29.561
OK.

618
01:06:58.101 --> 01:06:59.972
Aah! Aah!

619
01:07:12.811 --> 01:07:14.378
Aah!

620
01:07:17.946 --> 01:07:19.339
Aah!

621
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:47.498
No!

622
01:08:13.524 --> 01:08:15.917
Shit.

623
01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:42.161
- I heard a gun. What happened?
- He's dead.

624
01:08:44.381 --> 01:08:46.513
He's dead.
It killed him.

625
01:08:46.644 --> 01:08:48.689
that thing you saw.

626
01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:50.038
Wait. wh-what did you see?

627
01:08:52.693 --> 01:08:55.696
It was like some kind of
reptile. Didn't have any eyes.

628
01:08:55.827 --> 01:08:57.045
Shit.
Hey.

629
01:08:58.830 --> 01:08:59.787
Hey. Ben.

630
01:08:59.918 --> 01:09:01.833
Ben?

631
01:09:01.963 --> 01:09:04.401
Hey. Just breathe. OK?

632
01:09:04.531 --> 01:09:05.750
Breathe. Breathe. please.

633
01:09:07.404 --> 01:09:09.536
What the hell is this thing?

634
01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:11.843
I don't know.

635
01:09:11.973 --> 01:09:13.714
I don't know. We've gotta go.

636
01:09:13.845 --> 01:09:15.107
- No. we can't.
- No. we haveto go.

637
01:09:15.238 --> 01:09:16.717
- We can't go!
- We have to.

638
01:09:16.848 --> 01:09:19.938
Whatever it is.
it's still out there.

639
01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:22.549
OK. there must be a nest
somewhere behind the tank.

640
01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:27.119
All the noise we've been
making. the pump -

641
01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:30.035
it knows we're here.
That's what the scratching is.

642
01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.994
It's just trying to get in.

643
01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:35.258
Maybe we can make some noise.
lure it back into the tank.

644
01:09:35.388 --> 01:09:37.912
somehow bury it in there.
How? That lid doesn't stop it.

645
01:09:38.043 --> 01:09:40.654
There's spare gas in the shed.

646
01:09:40.785 --> 01:09:43.266
Mixed with that fertiliser.
it's highly explosive.

647
01:09:43.396 --> 01:09:44.615
I can rig a fuse.

648
01:09:46.312 --> 01:09:48.662
You can't go back in there.

649
01:09:48.793 --> 01:09:49.968
We don't have a choice!
It's gonna kill us in here.

650
01:09:50.098 --> 01:09:51.361
It's the only way
we can stop it.

651
01:09:52.927 --> 01:09:55.365
You and Reia stay upstairs.
Lock the door.

652
01:09:55.495 --> 01:09:57.541
Whatever happens. don't open it.

653
01:09:57.671 --> 01:09:59.978
No. we can make it to the car.

654
01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:03.242
No. we can't. baby.
not with her.

655
01:10:03.373 --> 01:10:05.070
When it's set.
I'll come get you.

656
01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.419
We won't have much time.

657
01:10:08.987 --> 01:10:10.597
You come back. OK?

658
01:10:10.728 --> 01:10:12.773
You come back.

659
01:15:01.453 --> 01:15:03.803
Hey. Stay here. sweetie. OK?

660
01:15:12.899 --> 01:15:14.161
It's OK.

661
01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:41.580
Archie.

662
01:17:41.308 --> 01:17:42.875
Ben!

663
01:17:51.536 --> 01:17:52.842
Aah!

664
01:17:56.367 --> 01:17:57.585
Aah!

665
01:17:59.762 --> 01:18:00.763
Aah!

666
01:18:01.764 --> 01:18:04.070
Aaah!

667
01:18:04.201 --> 01:18:05.681
Aah!

668
01:18:08.466 --> 01:18:10.163
Hey. sweetie. I need to go see
Daddy. I need to go help him.

669
01:18:10.294 --> 01:18:11.861
You just stay here.
Don't move. OK?

670
01:18:23.655 --> 01:18:25.962
Mom! Mommy!

671
01:18:26.092 --> 01:18:28.747
Sweetie. Sweetie.
OK. Just be quiet. OK?

672
01:19:24.063 --> 01:19:25.369
Mommy!

673
01:19:30.069 --> 01:19:32.115
Mommy!

674
01:19:32.245 --> 01:19:33.246
Aah!

675
01:19:33.377 --> 01:19:35.074
Mommy! Mom!

676
01:19:44.954 --> 01:19:46.129
Daddy!

677
01:19:59.533 --> 01:20:00.883
- Reia!
- Daddy!

678
01:20:16.246 --> 01:20:17.247
Ah!

679
01:20:29.607 --> 01:20:31.174
Reia!

680
01:20:40.009 --> 01:20:41.401
Reia!

681
01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:43.926
Reia!

682
01:20:47.451 --> 01:20:48.669
Get up! What happened?

683
01:20:49.888 --> 01:20:51.107
Where's Reia?

684
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:59.985
It took her... into the tank.
The fuse...

685
01:21:01.421 --> 01:21:02.858
It went off too soon.

686
01:21:09.255 --> 01:21:10.474
You can't kill this thing.

687
01:21:12.432 --> 01:21:14.304
I don't need to.

688
01:21:14.434 --> 01:21:16.610
I just need to keep it away
from me long enough.

689
01:21:18.308 --> 01:21:19.744
What are you doing?

690
01:21:21.702 --> 01:21:24.705
If it's an amphibian.
it breathes through its skin.

691
01:21:24.836 --> 01:21:27.578
This will burn it like acid.
OK.

692
01:21:27.708 --> 01:21:29.406
If I'm not back. get out
any way that you can.

693
01:21:29.536 --> 01:21:30.973
I'll come find you.

694
01:21:31.103 --> 01:21:33.540
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

695
01:21:41.984 --> 01:21:43.289
Come on. Jules.
You can do this.

696
01:22:08.793 --> 01:22:10.664
'Reia?

697
01:22:10.795 --> 01:22:12.318
'Can you hear me?'

698
01:22:15.495 --> 01:22:16.932
Reia.

699
01:22:33.252 --> 01:22:34.732
Reia?

700
01:22:34.862 --> 01:22:36.299
Can you hear me?

701
01:22:36.429 --> 01:22:38.649
Call to Mommy.

702
01:22:57.798 --> 01:22:59.365
Reia!

703
01:23:00.801 --> 01:23:02.325
Mommy!

704
