Hey. boss. What are you
still doing here. man?

6
00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:54.323
I thought
you were taking off early.
Yeah. well. I'm trying to.

7
00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.451
Why hasn't
the concrete pour started yet?

8
00:01:57.535 --> 00:02:00.412
The first truck blew a hose
in the alley.
They're fixing it now.

It's always something.
huh?

11
00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.543
Why don't you just
take off. man? We got this.

12
00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.795
No. no. I know you do.
but I gotta sign the invoice.

13
00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:10.464
Just sign it now.
I'll hold on to it
until we're finished.

14
00:02:14.218 --> 00:02:15.469
All right.

15
00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:16.971
Thanks. Bobby.

16
00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:18.639
But you still call me
when it's done. okay?

17
00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:19.849
You got it. boss.
All right.

Uh... Um...

I finished work early.

32
00:04:38.362 --> 00:04:40.698
I can hang downstairs
if you want.
That's okay.

33
00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:42.992
I'm done.

34
00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:45.869
How many miles?

35
00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:50.749
Five.
Five. Good.

36
00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.422

Are you kidding?

Nathan's invited
half the block already.

How's he doing?

40
00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.474
He's okay.

gonna be awkward for?
[chuckles]

43

I don't know. John.
It's not like I'm trying
to make it that way.

'Cause if you're just
doing this for Nathan.

I'm just... just checking.

49
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.920
It's just gonna take
some time...

50
00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:39.965
and some effort
from the both of us.

51
00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:46.388
We can do this. Ali.

[clears throat]

53
00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:55.105
All right.
I'm gonna go shower.

54
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:57.483
I'll call Deb. and I'll
tell him to come home.

55
00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:59.401
-Will you make sure
he washes his hands?
-Yeah.

56
00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:00.486

[laughs] Hey.

62

Are you still liking
this drafting table. kiddo?

65
00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:29.556
Yeah. I can draw
really good on it.

66
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.226
Yeah. I see that. Wow.
[water stops]

67
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:34.269
I like this one.
Come here.

69
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.689
God. you're really
a great artist. bud.

70
00:06:37.773 --> 00:06:38.857
Thank you.
Yeah.

71
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.860
So. how's school?
Good.

72
00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:44.780
Yeah? Your teachers
talking about this thing?

73
00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:49.076
Yeah. Mr. Williams said
Clarke is like a big snowball.
but made of gas.

74
00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.619
Wow.

75
00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.330
Asteroids are made of farts.
Okay. I got it.

76
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.915
[both laugh]

77
00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.584
No. Clarke
is a comet. silly.
not an asteroid.

78
00:06:57.668 --> 00:06:59.795
Oh. a comet. I didn't know
there was a difference.

79
00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.297
Comets move faster.
like. way. way faster.

80
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:04.883
Did you know
that Clarke was from
a different solar system?

81
00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:06.802
Which is why they don't
know much about it.

82
00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:09.221
Ah. Well.
now I know two things.

83
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.597
What?

84
00:07:10.681 --> 00:07:13.767
That you and comets
are made of farts.

85
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:15.060
No. you are.

86
00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.480
No. you are!
Come here.

How's this thing
working out?

90
00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:28.115
-Is it better than the shots?
-Way better.

91
00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.199
Yeah?

92
00:07:29.992 --> 00:07:30.993
Good.

93
00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:35.664
What's the matter. buddy?

94
00:07:39.418 --> 00:07:41.587
Is Mom gonna
make you leave again?

95

96
00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:50.554
Your mom and I. we got
some things to work out.

97
00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.932
But no matter what...

98
00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:56.393
Look at me. son.

99
00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.730
I'm always gonna be
your father. all right?

100
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.440
I'm never gonna leave you.

101
00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:03.984

108

00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:39.436
All right.
what do we got?
Fractions.

116
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.897
I thought
you were good at math.
I don't like fractions.

117
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.399
They're hard.

118
00:08:44.483 --> 00:08:47.361
Well. it's okay for it to
be hard. because fractions
and math are important.

119
00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:51.198
You think your dad can
build skyscrapers

120

You wanna
build skyscrapers like me?
Yeah.

Come on.
I'll give you a hand.

122
00:08:58.664 --> 00:09:02.334

That's loud. Dad.
What is it?

176
00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:34.671
Must be an AMBER Alert.

[man 2] About time. man.

197

Sit over here.

00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:22.988

Good to see you again. man.

You too. Kenny.
Hey. Deb.

[Ed] You're just in time.
One of the first chunks
is about to hit.

205
00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.253
[Nathan]
Clarke is gonna hit?
[Ed] Only part of it.

206
00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:39.796
Don't worry.
it's going into the ocean.

207
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.464
Dad. come
and sit with me!

208
00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:43.758
Yeah. I just gotta go
talk to your mom for a second.

209
00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:45.427
Hey.

210
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.637
Where's the beer and wine?
In the car.

211
00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:50.015
Listen. I just got one
of those Presidential Alerts.
Did you get one?

212
00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:52.309
No. It's probably just a test.
Can you get the stuff?

213
00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:55.061
No. Ali.
I don't think it's a test.

214
00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.647
They said our family's
been selected for shelter.

215
00:14:57.731 --> 00:15:01.192
I think something weird
is going on with this comet.

216
00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:04.362
But the news said
the fragment thing is falling
somewhere near Bermuda.

217
00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.865
Then why is half
of our military on the move

218
00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.159
with a ton of planes
in the sky?

219
00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.369
[Ed]
Hey. John. here it comes.
You guys. get in here.

220
00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:15.957
<i>Now. splashdown off the coast</i>

<i>it's unlikely</i>
<i>to cause a tsunami...</i>

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.006
Did you take a unit

224
00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:27.427
<i>...but it will give us</i>
<i>the largest impact since</i>
<i>the Tunguska event of 1908.</i>

225
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.304
<i>That's when a meteor</i>
<i>slammed into...</i>

226
00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.848
[Nathan] Look!
There's Clarke!
[Ed] Looks pretty cool. huh?

227
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.850
[newscaster]
<i>Spectacular first images here.</i>

228
00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.436

<i>And impact.</i>

234
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.953
Wait.
where's the explosion?

235
00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:56.456
[Kenny] It's a chunk of rock.
Rocks don't explode.

236
00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.124
Tell that
to the dinosaurs.

237
00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:00.502

What was that?
You guys okay?

247
00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:35.995
I think it was
a shock wave or...

248
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.039
<i>We now are getting word</i>
<i>that the fragment.</i>

[John] Yeah. yeah.

502
00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.870
I'll put Nathan's stuff
in the backpack
to keep it separate.

503
00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:48.954
Okay.

504
00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:53.250
I got your blanket. okay?
We'll put it in here.

505
00:29:53.334 --> 00:29:55.252
[John]
Put his pants in there.
Make room for--

506
00:29:55.336 --> 00:29:56.837
That's a shirt for me.

507
00:29:56.921 --> 00:29:58.464
John?
Yeah.

508
00:29:58.547 --> 00:30:00.925
Where is his medicine?
I put it in here. It's gone.

509
00:30:01.008 --> 00:30:02.843
What do you mean.
it's gone?

510
00:30:02.927 --> 00:30:05.554
It's gone.
It's not in there.
It's in there. You put it--

511
00:30:05.638 --> 00:30:08.516
Nathan. did you go
in your backpack?

512
00:30:08.599 --> 00:30:10.518
I wanted my blanket.

513
00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:11.602
Oh. God.

514
00:30:12.645 --> 00:30:15.356
He must've dropped it
in the car. Shit!

515
00:30:16.232 --> 00:30:17.858
What now? What do we do?

516
00:30:19.318 --> 00:30:20.319
Hang on.

517
00:30:21.946 --> 00:30:23.822
Please. please. please.

518
00:30:23.906 --> 00:30:25.533
Hey. excuse me.
Excuse me.

519
00:30:25.616 --> 00:30:27.826
How long
till our plane leaves?

520
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.828
Fifteen minutes.
Twenty. tops.

521
00:30:29.912 --> 00:30:32.039
Okay. Okay.

522
00:30:32.122 --> 00:30:34.917
I'm gonna go--
I'm gonna go get it.
Wait. what?

523
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.961
What. are we just gonna
leave his insulin?

524
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.380
I have the wristband.
John.

525
00:30:39.463 --> 00:30:42.132
Look.
I'll meet you on the plane.

526
00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:43.884
Just text me
which one you're on.

527
00:30:43.968 --> 00:30:46.011
[soldier 3] Keep moving.
[Ali] It's okay.

528
00:30:46.095 --> 00:30:48.514
He'll be right back.
Okay?

529
00:30:48.597 --> 00:30:50.099
We're gonna put this
in here.

530
00:30:50.182 --> 00:30:53.561
[shouting]

531
00:30:53.644 --> 00:30:56.313
Let's go. let's go.
let's go.

532
00:30:56.397 --> 00:30:58.315
No. I need
to grab something
from the car.

533
00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:00.192
I have my wristband.
Can I get back in?

534
00:31:00.276 --> 00:31:01.402
Yeah. go ahead. Go.

535
00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:02.486
Okay.

536
00:31:06.657 --> 00:31:07.700
All right.

537
00:31:07.783 --> 00:31:10.452
[airplane engine whirring]

538
00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:11.870
Uh...

539
00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:17.793
You know what?
Come here. Come here.

540
00:31:18.502 --> 00:31:20.337
Hey! Excuse me.

541
00:31:20.421 --> 00:31:22.423
Look. I know my husband
just talked to you.

542
00:31:22.506 --> 00:31:24.883
He's going back to the car
to get my son's meds.

543
00:31:24.967 --> 00:31:27.469
Can you make sure
he gets on our plane--
Meds?

544
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:30.848
Yeah.
It's just his insulin.

545
00:31:31.473 --> 00:31:32.516
Sergeant Ruiz?

546
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.934
What's the problem?

547
00:31:34.018 --> 00:31:35.227
What's up?

548
00:31:35.311 --> 00:31:36.895
It's okay.
I just explained to him.

549
00:31:36.979 --> 00:31:39.356
It's just for his insulin pump.
It's not a big deal.

550
00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:43.027
You know what?
Forget it. It's fine.
We don't need it.

551
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.987
That's not the issue.
ma'am.

552
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.197
Don't worry about it.
We'll use the shots.
It's not a big deal.

553
00:31:47.281 --> 00:31:48.782
Line one.
we need an escort.
What?

554
00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:51.785
Look. we have the bracelets.
We were selected.

555
00:31:52.578 --> 00:31:53.871
Follow me.
please. ma'am.

556
00:31:53.954 --> 00:31:55.664
No. no. no. Why?

557
00:31:55.748 --> 00:31:57.333
Ma'am. I'm not asking.

558
00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:00.294
Let's go.

559
00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:05.924
It's okay.

560
00:32:10.471 --> 00:32:11.597
[car alarm chirps]

561
00:32:15.726 --> 00:32:17.603
[grunting]

562
00:32:22.483 --> 00:32:24.610
[man 1]
Come on. Hurry up!
[man 2] Over here!

563
00:32:24.693 --> 00:32:27.237
[woman] No. Captain.
I don't remember
giving the order on that.

564
00:32:27.321 --> 00:32:29.657
No. tell me something.
how is there a problem
with that manifest?

565
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.784
I signed for it myself.

566
00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:35.245
Then I will come down there
and check it.
I'll be down there in five.

567
00:32:37.081 --> 00:32:39.291
The kid's diabetic.
Don't touch him.

568
00:32:39.375 --> 00:32:41.669
I'm sorry.
You should've been informed.

569
00:32:41.752 --> 00:32:44.129
Anyone with
a chronic condition
can't be on the plane.

570
00:32:44.213 --> 00:32:46.006
It's just diabetes.

571
00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.425
His condition
should've been flagged
at screening.

572
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:51.303
If I hadn't said anything
to the guard. he'd
have no idea he had a pump.

573
00:32:51.387 --> 00:32:53.222
There's nothing I can do
about that. ma'am.

574
00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:56.058
[sighs] You can pretend
that you didn't see it.

575
00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:59.269
-Ma'am. I didn't
write the rule. Sorry.
-Then ignore it!

576
00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:02.648
What if this
was your family?

577
00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:08.445
My family wasn't selected.
ma'am.

578
00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:13.409
99% of armed forces
weren't.

579
00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:16.453
We are all volunteers here
just doing our jobs.

580
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:18.247
I'm sorry.

581
00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:21.709
I am.

582
00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:25.462
But please...

583
00:33:25.546 --> 00:33:28.841
His father. my husband.
is on one of those planes
right now.

584
00:33:28.924 --> 00:33:30.551
What am I
supposed to do?

585
00:33:38.809 --> 00:33:39.810
Hey!

586
00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:04.376
This is Breen.

587
00:34:05.461 --> 00:34:06.920
Yeah. I'm looking
for a passenger.

588
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.757
Ma'am. what's his name?

589
00:34:11.425 --> 00:34:12.885
John Allan Garrity.

590
00:34:14.094 --> 00:34:15.095
Chalk 33?

591
00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.474
Yeah. his son was flagged.

592
00:34:18.557 --> 00:34:20.184
Thank you.
They're looking for him.

593
00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:22.644
Thank you. Thank you.

594
00:34:23.604 --> 00:34:25.814
[helicopter whirring]

595
00:34:29.318 --> 00:34:32.070
[airplane passing overhead]

596
00:34:32.738 --> 00:34:34.031
Allison!

597
00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:36.074
Nathan!

598
00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:38.368
Allison!

599
00:34:47.211 --> 00:34:50.464
Do not run.
Move in an orderly fashion
to your designated aircraft.

600
00:34:50.547 --> 00:34:53.509
Have you seen a kid?
He's age seven.
He's wearing a gray hoodie.

601
00:34:53.592 --> 00:34:56.261
And his mom is dark-haired.
She's about 5'7".

602
00:34:56.345 --> 00:34:58.639
I've seen
a lot of kids. sir.
Please keep moving.

603
00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:00.849
I need to know
if they made it on first.

604
00:35:00.933 --> 00:35:03.393
Do they have bracelets?
We all have them. yeah.

605
00:35:03.477 --> 00:35:05.229
Then they're on
one of these planes.

606
00:35:05.312 --> 00:35:07.481
Are you sure they're all
going to the same place?

607
00:35:07.564 --> 00:35:08.899
Yes. Now go.

608
00:35:09.983 --> 00:35:12.444
Everyone keep moving
in an orderly fashion!

609
00:35:12.528 --> 00:35:13.654
Allison!

610
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:16.281
[female soldier]
Do not run!

611
00:35:17.699 --> 00:35:19.576
Okay.
Thank you. Lieutenant.

612
00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.537
[handset

[Breen sighs]

613
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.122
Ma'am. they're boarding.
There's nothing more
I can do for you.

614
00:35:24.206 --> 00:35:26.917
No. no. no. Come on. You can
go on one of those planes
and look for him.

615
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.379
There are dozens of planes
with over 2.000 passengers
crammed in.

616
00:35:30.462 --> 00:35:32.965
I can't hold them up
for this.
Are there phones? Can I call?

617
00:35:33.048 --> 00:35:35.050
I don't know
if there's any phones.

618
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:37.761
-Where are these planes going?
-Shelter destinations
are classified.

619
00:35:37.845 --> 00:35:40.681
Look. ma'am.
this is an emergency operation
with a lot of moving parts.

620
00:35:40.764 --> 00:35:43.475
I am just in transport.
I wish I had
more answers for you.

621
00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:45.143
Please.
What am I supposed to do?

622
00:35:45.227 --> 00:35:47.604
I'm very sorry.
Stop. stop. No. no. no!

623
00:35:47.688 --> 00:35:50.816
Ma'am. I need you
to step this way.

Everybody sit down!

Everyone find a seat.
Sir. find a seat.
We're ready to roll.

633
00:36:17.759 --> 00:36:20.095
I'm trying to find
my wife and kid.
They're on this plane.

634
00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:22.681
I need you to sit down.
We gotta get wheels up.

635

Hey. Hey.
Hey. how'd you get on?

641
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.146
What do you mean?
I was selected.

642
00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:12.773
Yeah. I know.
With those.

643
00:37:13.774 --> 00:37:15.901
No. it's my son's.

644
00:37:15.984 --> 00:37:17.611
He's diabetic.

645
00:37:17.694 --> 00:37:20.197
Yeah. so is my sister's kid.
and they turned him away.

646
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.823
They said no illnesses.

647
00:37:21.907 --> 00:37:24.534
Do you know somebody
who can help us?

You gotta let me out.

I've gotta get to my kid.

655
00:37:43.345 --> 00:37:45.555
You get off this plane.
we are leaving without you.

656
00:37:45.639 --> 00:37:48.350
That's okay.
Just let me off the plane!

Hey. Ali.
I can't hear you.

845
00:49:26.881 --> 00:49:28.508
<i>Hello?</i>

846
00:49:28.591 --> 00:49:30.802
<i>Are you at your dad's?</i>

847
00:49:30.885 --> 00:49:33.137

853
00:49:43.022 --> 00:49:45.024
Is that Dad?
Yeah. that's him.

854
00:49:45.108 --> 00:49:47.527
Where is he?
I don't know.
The phone's not working.

855
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:49.654
I wanna see him.
I know.

856
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:53.032
We're gonna meet him
at Grandpa's. It's okay.
He's gonna meet us there.

Kiss my ass. Clarke!

861
00:50:21.269 --> 00:50:23.730
[man] Come on. guys.
Everybody in.

862
00:50:24.981 --> 00:50:26.357
Hey. Hey!

863
00:50:26.441 --> 00:50:27.442
Excuse me.

864
00:50:28.568 --> 00:50:30.611
Where are you headed?
North.

865
00:50:30.695 --> 00:50:32.113
How far?
Canada.

866
00:50:32.196 --> 00:50:34.115
Can you take me
to Lexington. Kentucky?

867
00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:36.242
It's on the way there.

868
00:50:36.325 --> 00:50:37.702
Okay.
but you gotta get in now.

869
00:50:37.785 --> 00:50:39.412
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

870
00:50:44.709 --> 00:50:46.794
[engine starts]

871
00:51:22.622 --> 00:51:23.623
So. what do you do?

872
00:51:24.707 --> 00:51:25.708
What?

873
00:51:25.792 --> 00:51:27.168
What do I do?

874
00:51:30.797 --> 00:51:33.257
They're selecting people
based on their professions.

875
00:51:33.341 --> 00:51:36.052
Like my mom. she was selected
because she's a doctor.

876
00:51:39.847 --> 00:51:43.184
I'm a structural engineer.
I build buildings.

877
00:51:43.267 --> 00:51:46.062
We definitely need those.

878
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:48.481
Hey. I'm John.

879
00:51:48.564 --> 00:51:50.066
Colin.

880
00:51:50.149 --> 00:51:51.150
Good to meet you.

881
00:51:51.234 --> 00:51:53.277
You as well.
You as well.

882
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:56.489
So. if your mum got accepted.
why are you not
with your family?

883
00:51:58.991 --> 00:52:01.202
I haven't spoken
to my family
in seven years.

884
00:52:03.287 --> 00:52:05.289
I found out about all this
through my sister.

885
00:52:05.373 --> 00:52:08.751
Yeah. Me and my mom.
we had our issues.

886
00:52:10.086 --> 00:52:12.004
So much
for holding grudges.
right?

887
00:52:14.507 --> 00:52:15.883
What about you?

888
00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:20.137
I don't like flying.
Thought I'd walk.

889
00:52:20.221 --> 00:52:21.222
[laughs]

890
00:52:23.015 --> 00:52:26.310
I lost my wife and son
at the military base.

891
00:52:26.394 --> 00:52:28.396
and I'm trying
to meet up with them now.

892
00:52:35.403 --> 00:52:36.988
All right. look.

893
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:39.240
So my boy Manny
that's driving.

894
00:52:39.323 --> 00:52:41.492
he knows some pilots
in Canada.

895
00:52:41.576 --> 00:52:43.870
That's where
we're all headed.

896
00:52:43.953 --> 00:52:46.080
They're giving some people
rides to the shelters.

897
00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:50.960
But the shelters are
classified. How do they even
know where they're going?

898
00:52:51.043 --> 00:52:53.462
They've been tracking
the military flights
to Greenland.

899
00:52:53.546 --> 00:52:54.672
Greenland?

900
00:52:56.215 --> 00:52:57.633
You should come with us.

901
00:52:57.717 --> 00:52:59.218
Nah. thanks.

902
00:52:59.302 --> 00:53:02.346
but I gotta find my wife
and family in Kentucky.

903
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:04.307
So find 'em
and meet up with us
after.

904
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:06.309
We're taking off
from Osgoode.

905
00:53:06.392 --> 00:53:08.311
It's a small city
right across the border.

906
00:53:11.439 --> 00:53:13.232
How do you know
you're even gonna get in?

907
00:53:14.901 --> 00:53:16.611
Only one way
to find out. right?

908
00:53:59.654 --> 00:54:03.824
You know. it's gonna be tough
getting that far north.

909
00:54:03.908 --> 00:54:05.701
all the way up to Lexington.

910
00:54:08.537 --> 00:54:10.539
I mean.
it's crazy out here.

911
00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:14.502
Are you sure you don't wanna
just come with us?

912
00:54:16.128 --> 00:54:18.464
You know. get on a plane?

913
00:54:20.091 --> 00:54:24.178
I already tried that.
It didn't work. so I just need
to get to my dad's.

914
00:54:24.261 --> 00:54:25.846
Oh. okay.

915
00:54:28.391 --> 00:54:29.558
[scoffs]

916
00:54:32.478 --> 00:54:33.688
Ralph. what is it?

917
00:54:37.233 --> 00:54:39.485
I just... I can't...

918
00:54:39.568 --> 00:54:41.737
I can't believe
all them soldiers
at the airport.

919
00:54:41.821 --> 00:54:43.990
that they would
turn that boy away.

920
00:54:44.073 --> 00:54:45.825
I mean.
with a face like that?

921
00:54:47.868 --> 00:54:49.996
[woman]
She already told you
that's what happened.

922
00:54:50.079 --> 00:54:51.998
Yeah. well. maybe...

923
00:54:52.081 --> 00:54:54.625
maybe if he had
some different family
with him...

924
00:54:59.422 --> 00:55:02.091
-[turn signal clicking]
-What are you doing?

925
00:55:02.174 --> 00:55:04.010
Wait. What are you doing?
Why are you stopping?

926
00:55:04.093 --> 00:55:05.219
Ralph!

927
00:55:07.888 --> 00:55:11.892
Look. your husband.
he abandoned you.
But you don't gotta worry.

928
00:55:11.976 --> 00:55:13.936
I'm gonna get your son
to safety. I promise you.

929
00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.479
I'm gonna get him
on that plane.

930
00:55:15.563 --> 00:55:17.189
-Ralph. Wait.
-No. You don't have to--

931
00:55:17.273 --> 00:55:18.733
Where are you going?
Oh. my God!

932
00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:20.443

I'm from Atlanta.

Nope.

971
00:57:28.362 --> 00:57:29.613

Where were you born?

973
00:57:36.287 --> 00:57:38.372
What does it matter?

974
00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:40.583
What matters is
you don't deserve that band.

975
00:57:45.504 --> 00:57:46.547
All right. listen.

976
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:47.965
You're gonna give it
to me.

977
00:57:50.217 --> 00:57:52.219
It wouldn't do you
any good.

978
00:57:52.303 --> 00:57:53.804
It's got my name on it.

979
00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:56.473
It wouldn't work for you.

980
00:57:56.557 --> 00:57:58.434
You're gonna give me
your license too.

01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:16.101
[man filming]
<i>All of downtown</i>

1184
01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:17.852
<i>Check it out.</i>
<i>There's another one.</i>

1185
01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:20.271
[people chattering]
[woman screams]

1186
01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:22.690
<i>Wait. Is that coming</i>
<i>towards us? Wait. Holy--</i>

1187
01:13:22.774 --> 01:13:23.942
<i>Yo. run!</i>

1188
01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:28.279
<i>Yet another shocking image--</i>

1189
01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:30.657
-[interviewee]
<i>Sometimes they come down...</i>
-[newscaster] <i>Wow.</i>

1190
01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.576
[interviewee] <i>They come</i>
<i>out of nowhere. you know?</i>
<i>There's no warning.</i>

1191
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:35.703
<i>-We're just trying to keep up.</i>
-[newscaster] <i>Yeah.</i>

1192
01:13:35.787 --> 01:13:37.413
[interviewee] <i>And. uh...</i>

1193
01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:40.416
<i>having in the back of our head</i>
<i>that tomorrow we're--</i>

1194
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.503
<i>It's all gonna be for nothing.</i>

1195
01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:51.636
[breathing shakily]

1196
01:13:57.934 --> 01:13:59.811
[grunting]

1197
01:14:14.242 --> 01:14:17.287
[panting]

1198
01:14:20.915 --> 01:14:24.085
[grunts loudly]

1199
01:15:12.467 --> 01:15:13.635
[cell phone chimes]

1200
01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:19.515
[sighs]

1201
01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:21.476
Now it comes.

1202
01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:50.213
[man] What a load of shit.

1203
01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:57.804
[man 2] Looks like I'm gonna
have to dip into my savings
for this next round.

1204
01:15:59.806 --> 01:16:01.683
[man sighs]

1205
01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:05.103
You're alone.
Where's Allison?

1206
01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:07.438
Where is she?
I was hoping she'd be here.

1207
01:16:07.522 --> 01:16:09.816
Why are my friends stuck here
babysitting me

1208
01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:12.902
while my daughter and grandson
are out there alone.

1209
01:16:12.986 --> 01:16:15.154
and I'm here
with no way to find them?

1210
01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:18.408
We lost each other at
the airfield. and she left me
a note to meet her here.

1211
01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:20.451
[sighs] Fuck.

1212
01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:25.456
[man 3]
Maybe we should go.

1213
01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:28.167
She told me you were
moving back in.

1214
01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:30.795
Let me guess.
you had another fight?

1215
01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:34.257
We both want the same thing.
okay. for them
to get here safely.

1216
01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.801
So why don't we try
to work together?

1217
01:16:38.136 --> 01:16:40.555
Okay.
Did you try the landline?

1218
01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:44.100
Go ahead. I tried
about an hour ago again.

1219
01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:45.935
Keeps going
straight to voice mail.

1220
01:16:46.019 --> 01:16:48.438
Or you get that
stupid government message.

1221
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:53.651
[grunts] God. you would
think technology would
work in emergencies.

1222
01:16:58.573 --> 01:16:59.574
Hey.

1223
01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:02.952
What happened to you?

1224
01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:04.829
Nothing.
Come on.

1225
01:17:05.747 --> 01:17:07.206
[sighs]

1226
01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:08.791
It's been a long day.

1227
01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:12.795
Just want 'em back.
I just--

1228
01:17:59.759 --> 01:18:02.428
[Ali] Okay.
there's a pay phone there.
Let's try that.

1229
01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.561
Yes.

1230
01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:13.773
[phone rings]

1231
01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:19.529
Hello? Where? Stay there.
Stay right there.

1232
01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:22.031
Where are they?
Down the road. Let's go.

1233
01:18:38.673 --> 01:18:39.674
[sighs]

1234
01:18:40.675 --> 01:18:41.676
Hey.

1235
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.138
[both groan]

1236
01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:48.099
[John sighs. breathes heavily]

1237
01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:53.729
I'm sorry. honey.
I tried. I tried.

1238
01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:56.524
I know. It's okay.

1239
01:18:57.525 --> 01:18:58.526
Kiddo.

1240
01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:00.236
How you doing?
Good.

1241
01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:02.071
Yeah? Here.

1242
01:19:02.155 --> 01:19:05.366
Come here.
How you doing? Okay?

1243
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:07.493
Thanks for looking after
your mom. bud.

1244
01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:13.458
[breathes heavily]

1245
01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:14.917
Hi. Dad.

1246
01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:17.003
Hey. sunflower.
[Ali cries]

1247
01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:25.887
[breathes deeply] Oh.

1248
01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.977
Come on. honey.
Let's get you guys home.

1249
01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:35.021
Okay.

1250
01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.192
Come on.

1251
01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:42.195
[crying continues]

1252
01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:45.698
All right. welcome.
You hungry?
What do you wanna eat?

1253
01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:47.825
Pancakes.
Pancakes. Syrup?

1254
01:19:47.909 --> 01:19:48.993
Yeah!
Yeah!

1255
01:19:49.076 --> 01:19:50.745
No.
No.

1256
01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:52.538
No. I forgot.
We don't have enough insulin
as it is.

1257
01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:53.915
Aw!

1258
01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:56.250
I have his medication here.
You do?

1259
01:19:56.334 --> 01:19:59.670
Yeah. It was out of
the fridge for a long time.
but it should still be good.

1260
01:19:59.754 --> 01:20:00.755
Thank you.

1261
01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.593
[Ali's dad]
You remember where this goes?

1262
01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:08.387
What do you want?
Some water?
Some water. yeah.

1263
01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:10.806
Way to go. All right!

1264
01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.059
This good?
Yep! Perfect.

1265
01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:16.229
"Perfectomundo."
We should check the news.

1266
01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:18.439
What do you think?

1267
01:20:18.523 --> 01:20:22.068
[newscaster] <i>At approximately</i>

<i>...hydroponic seed farms.</i>
<i>medical supplies</i>

1282
01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:05.403
A lot of good
that'll do us now.
The footage is older than me.

1283
01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:07.196
Who knows
what shape it's in?

1284
01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.781
At least here
we'll be together.

1285
01:21:10.116 --> 01:21:11.325
What are you doing. John?

1286
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:14.287
There's another way
for us to get there.

1287
01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.706
Where?
To Greenland.

1288
01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:18.916
There are pilots going
from up in Canada.

1289
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.751
They're taking people.
They're not military.

1290
01:21:20.835 --> 01:21:23.504
Look. it's just over
12 hours to Osgoode.

1291
01:21:23.588 --> 01:21:25.339
But we can do it in nine.

1292
01:21:25.423 --> 01:21:27.717
And then
it's another six to eight
hours for the flight.

1293
01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:30.553
We can make this.

1294
01:21:30.636 --> 01:21:32.638
My bracelet. What if
they don't let us in? They've
already flagged Nathan.

1295
01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:34.473
Honey. it's our only chance.

1296
01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:37.351
Now listen. We can either stay
here or we can give it a shot.

1297
01:21:37.435 --> 01:21:40.771
But if we give it a shot.
I swear I will get us
into those bunkers.

1298
01:21:41.981 --> 01:21:44.025
But if we're gonna go.

1299
01:21:44.108 --> 01:21:45.651
we gotta go now.

1300
01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:48.988
Okay.
Okay.

1301
01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:50.948
Okay. Let's do it.
All right.

1302
01:21:51.032 --> 01:21:52.992
Nathan. let's get ready.
We left some clothes
in the guest room.

1303
01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:54.619
What about the pancakes?

1304
01:21:54.702 --> 01:21:57.163
I'll make 'em. Don't worry.
They're on their way.

1305
01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:07.882
[water running]
[Ali] Okay. Nathan.

1306
01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:09.592
Go ahead.
take your clothes off.

1307
01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:11.510
There you go.
All right. step in.

1308
01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:13.596
Shampoo's over there.
Grab that.

1309
01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.973
Okay. Go ahead.
Wash yourself.

1310
01:22:18.017 --> 01:22:19.018
Good job.

1311
01:22:19.894 --> 01:22:21.187
Okay. Hurry up.
[sighs]

1312
01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:28.569
Hey.

01:22:35.785 --> 01:22:36.786
[sighs]

1315
01:22:37.745 --> 01:22:39.455
You need
to pack some clothes. Dale.

1316
01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:41.832
We barely have enough time
as it is.

1317
01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:44.543
Ah. somebody's gotta stay
and watch Beck.

1318
01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:47.088
Mary'd kill me
if I left him.

1319
01:22:47.922 --> 01:22:50.549
Man. she spent hours
in here.

1320
01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:55.388
Now I can't separate the smell
from my memory of her anymore.

1321
01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:56.889
[chuckling] God.

1322
01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:58.599
Hay and horse shit.

1323
01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:02.019
Dale.

1324
01:23:02.103 --> 01:23:05.022
this isn't some storm
you can ride out.

1325
01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:08.275
Look...

1326
01:23:09.777 --> 01:23:12.530
I don't fold
when things get rough.

1327
01:23:15.783 --> 01:23:18.661
I know you guys' marriage
was on the rocks.

1328
01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:20.913
Every marriage
goes through shit.

1329
01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:23.666
Every marriage
goes through shit.

1330
01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:28.337
That don't mean you get to
jump into another woman's bed.

1331
01:23:31.257 --> 01:23:32.758
You're right. I did.

1332
01:23:34.385 --> 01:23:37.763
And I'm gonna
have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

1333
01:23:38.848 --> 01:23:41.267
I'm not expecting
your forgiveness. Dale.

1334
01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:45.396
But if I get one thing right.

1335
01:23:45.479 --> 01:23:48.816
I'm gonna get my son
and my wife into that bunker.

1336
01:23:51.193 --> 01:23:52.611
[footsteps]

1337
01:24:03.122 --> 01:24:04.540
Please come with us.

1338
01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:06.876
No.

1339
01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:09.128
Why are you being
so stubborn? Just come.

1340
01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:10.838
You know
you'll die here. Dale.

1341
01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:12.882
Of course I will.

1342
01:24:12.965 --> 01:24:16.844
Today. tomorrow.
10 years from now. don't make
no difference to me.

1343
01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:20.014
My Mary went to heaven
in this place.

1344
01:24:22.183 --> 01:24:24.602
And when the good Lord's ready
for me to join her.

1345
01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:28.105
I'm gonna be right here
in this place too...

1346
01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:31.150
bags packed.

1347
01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:35.446

1348
