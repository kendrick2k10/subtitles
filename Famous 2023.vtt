- [Ernestine] Okay.

879
00:51:12.808 --> 00:51:15.811
All right. Hello.
And your name. please.

880
00:51:15.985 --> 00:51:17.726
Listeners. we're back.

881
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.294
because the man called Famous
has got something to say.

882
00:51:20.468 --> 00:51:21.861
You never had a recovery.

883
00:51:22.035 --> 00:51:24.211
My stepdad took me somewhere
to go to rehab

884
00:51:24.385 --> 00:51:27.780
with real people
with real problems.

885
00:51:27.954 --> 00:51:29.912
And that's where I met someone

886
00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:31.523
that I thought you'd all meet.

887
00:51:32.828 --> 00:51:34.352
We didn't hear about that.

888
00:51:34.526 --> 00:51:36.484
Welcome to life as an addict.

889
00:51:36.658 --> 00:51:39.792
My story only gets covered
when my life gets erratic.

890
00:51:39.966 --> 00:51:42.534
But my good days.
my best days?

891
00:51:42.708 --> 00:51:44.013
They don't cover that shit.

892
00:51:44.188 --> 00:51:45.841
You're really
letting it all hang out.

893
00:51:46.015 --> 00:51:47.713
- But aren't you worried?
- Not once.

894
00:51:47.887 --> 00:51:49.497
Because of your brother.

895
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:52.500
My brother took away
my problems. my pain.

896
00:51:52.674 --> 00:51:54.720
Was he my real cocaine?

897
00:51:54.894 --> 00:51:56.113
But nothing's wrong

898
00:51:56.287 --> 00:51:57.984
if the dealer
wears white. right?

899
00:51:58.158 --> 00:52:00.029
Wait. are you talking
about your brother.

900
00:52:00.204 --> 00:52:01.770
or Big Pharma?

901
00:52:01.944 --> 00:52:04.730
But also. nothing's wrong
if the dealers wear gray

902
00:52:04.904 --> 00:52:07.341
and sell drugs
on the S&P every single day.

903
00:52:07.515 --> 00:52:11.563
My man. this is your new sound.
or your other new sound?

904
00:52:11.737 --> 00:52:13.391
Because I met a girl.

905
00:52:13.565 --> 00:52:16.568
She told me to focus on life.

906
00:52:16.742 --> 00:52:20.093
But I just wanted to
make her my wife.

907
00:52:20.267 --> 00:52:23.270
I promised her that
I was done doing everything

908
00:52:23.444 --> 00:52:26.099
that was doing me in.

909
00:52:26.273 --> 00:52:28.971
But I don't think
she believed me.

910
00:52:29.146 --> 00:52:31.278
Like she met me before
or someone just like me.

911
00:52:33.976 --> 00:52:36.544

- Jenny Favero.

912
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:39.373
Oh.

913
00:52:39.547 --> 00:52:42.420
Oh. I-- I'm sorry.
your name is not on the list.

914
00:52:42.594 --> 00:52:44.639
And unfortunately.
we're not dispensing

915

Oh. but I need my methadone.

917

to come back to a drop-in.

918

with getting your funding.

919

920
00:52:55.302 --> 00:52:57.348
But I'm-- no. I need it now.

coming back to me.

just lately...

930
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:22.155
and I've been wanting
to say goodbye.

931
00:53:23.417 --> 00:53:24.940

932
00:53:25.114 --> 00:53:26.855
Well...

933

we're not who we used to be.

934
00:53:30.729 --> 00:53:32.383

second chances.

938

Uh. they want music
instead of methadone?

939
00:53:53.099 --> 00:53:56.189
Well. music can help
lift your dopamine levels.

940
00:53:56.363 --> 00:53:57.843
just like methadone

941
00:53:58.017 --> 00:54:00.933
