00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:31.083
Clóvis!

5
00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:34.166
Have you talked to your dad's girlfriend?

6
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.166
Aren't you Dad's girlfriend?

7
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.625
Dad's girlfriend is Aunt Jussara.

8
00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:39.958
Pay attention.

9
00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.666
Mom and Dad are no longer together.

10
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.166
You will live with them.

11
00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:47.083
Aunt Jussara is rich! Very rich!

12
00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.833
It's for the best. dear.

13
00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:51.791
Mommy is not leaving you. though.

14
00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:56.000
I just want you to have everything.
You'll see.

15
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.125
<i>I never understood her.</i>

16
00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:04.583
<i>And I understand family issues.</i>

17
00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:05.958
<i>I had several.</i>

18
00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:09.708
<i>My mom left me with Dad and Aunt Jussara.</i>

19
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.416
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

20
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.666
Make a wish!

21
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.375
<i>Then. my dad took off</i>
<i>and left me with her.</i>

22
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:20.750
-Blow it out!
<i>-She married Dirceu.</i>

23
00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.083
Make a wish. come on.

24
00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:24.166
Hurry up. Clóvis.

25
00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:27.500
Yay!

26
00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:29.333
<i>Then Aunt Jussara also left me.</i>

27
00:03:29.416 --> 00:03:31.666
-Blow it!
<i>-Dirceu married Soninha.</i>

28
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.375
Make a wish. quick.

29
00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:35.000
Hurry up. boy.

30
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.041
-Great.
<i>-Then Soninha left him.</i>

31
00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:41.750
<i>By then. I was living</i>
<i>with Soninha and Rubens.</i>

32
00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:44.375
Let's sing "Happy Birthday" to him!
Come quick!

33
00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.125
-Lohane!
-<i>Lohane's father.</i>

34
00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:49.750
I want a picture!

35
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:52.708
No. Clóvis! Stay. You're family!

36
00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:55.500
<i>That's Lohane. Rubens' daughter.</i>
<i>my stepsister.</i>

37
00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:57.625
<i>We got along quite well.</i>

38
00:03:57.708 --> 00:03:59.416
<i>My longest stay was there.</i>

39
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.875
<i>We grew up together. I really liked her.</i>

40
00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:06.375
<i>As time went by.</i>

41
00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:09.541
{\an8}<i>I left as soon as I could</i>
<i>to live on my own.</i>

42
00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:10.708
{\an8}15 YEARS LATER

43
00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:13.833
<i>But doing what?</i>

44
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.458
<i>I could paint well.</i>

45
00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:21.625
<i>As time passed. I got really good.</i>

46
00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:24.583
<i>I was able to paint actual works of art.</i>

47
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.625
<i>I mean. works of art that were actually…</i>

48
00:04:29.708 --> 00:04:30.833
<i>fake.</i>

49
00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:36.958
<i>Then I met a big shot</i>
<i>who buys this kind of stuff.</i>

50
00:04:37.666 --> 00:04:39.125
This is great!

51
00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:43.041
It's a piece by an artist known worldwide!

52
00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:46.833
Everyone in Paris. Milan.
and New York knows who he is.

53
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.916
I'll pay half the price.

54
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.666
What? We already agreed on the value!

55
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.583
You know that!

56
00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:54.750
I'll pay half the price.

57
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:56.500
No deal.

58
00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:59.208
Come with Daddy. son. Art doesn't pay.

59
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.208
Fortunato. what's going on here?

60
00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:03.291
-It's the auction deal.
-Deal?

61
00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:05.833
He wants to pay half the agreed price.

62
00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:07.500
Should I destroy the piece

63
00:05:07.583 --> 00:05:09.041
and sell him half of it?

64
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:10.458
Fortunato.

65
00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:12.458
pay him the right amount.

66
00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:15.833
Thank you. Senator.

67
00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:18.416
Thank you so much. You are a good man.

68
00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.666
If you need anything. just ask me.

69
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.166
That Portinari piece?

70
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.750
Auctioned off
for five times its original price.

71
00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:27.500
Great. Talk to Fortunato.

72
00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:30.541
<i>I sold him a painting for a good price.</i>

73
00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:31.875
Look.

74
00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.875
Daddy loves you.
but it's for the best. okay?

75
00:05:37.416 --> 00:05:40.416
Thank you. Senator. You're very generous.

76
00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:42.625
See you soon.

77
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:55.833
<i>My day was just beginning.</i>

78
00:05:55.916 --> 00:05:58.375
<i>A con artist never performs only once.</i>

79
00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:03.083
Help!

80
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.833
Help!

81
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.291
-Help!
-What's the matter?

82
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.625
Can anyone just come in here?

83
00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:13.750
Is there someone bothering you?

84
00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:16.958
The fly that just got in here
and in my hot chocolate.

85
00:06:17.041 --> 00:06:18.416
I almost swallowed it.

86
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.916
Luckily. I spit it out.

87
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.500
I'll handle it.

88
00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:22.458
Please.

89
00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.416
-We have a problem.
-What is it?

90
00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:28.500
It seems a fly fell in his drink.

91
00:06:28.583 --> 00:06:30.041
Excuse me.

92
00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:32.500
-Let's avoid further embarrassment.
-Yes.

93
00:06:32.583 --> 00:06:34.875
The hot chocolate is on the house.

94
00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.250
The hot chocolate?

95
00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:41.333
Just the hot chocolate
is on the house. Funny!

96
00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:42.958
What about the rest?

97
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:46.125
The rest is the whole menu.
You ate it all.

98
00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:47.291
Even a fly!

99
00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:50.041
Ladies and gentlemen. a minute. please.

100
00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:51.250
Pay attention.

101
00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:52.958
Pay attention. silly girl.

102
00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:56.041
I'm sorry for disturbing your breakfast.

103
00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:59.791
but. unfortunately.
we're served flies in Brazil.

104
00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:04.083
You can't leave without paying
after eating everything on the menu.

105
00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:08.083
I will pay for it. That's not the point.
It will cost you a lot.

106
00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:11.125
I'll pay.
I don't need charity or anything.

107
00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:15.333
-I want justice.
-Clean it up. please.

108
00:07:15.416 --> 00:07:19.125
Don't touch the crime scene! All right?

109
00:07:19.208 --> 00:07:21.958
I want a forensic examination. I'll do it.

110
00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:29.500
Guys. I just can't. It's sad. you know?

111
00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:33.458
It died on such a beautiful morning.
Did you see that?

112
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:35.500
It used to fly so freely.

113
00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:38.125
What a sudden and unnecessary death!

114
00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:43.125
I killed it. lady!
I killed it. I'm devastated!

115
00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:45.500
Poor thing!

116
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.208
Forgive me. Buddha!

117
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:51.416
All right. no harm done.
No need to pay for anything.

118
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.166
It's on the house. okay?

119
00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:55.291
You can leave now.

120
00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:59.000
That's great.
Let's avoid further embarrassment.

121
00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:00.625
-Sure.
-I'll forgive you.

122
00:08:03.458 --> 00:08:04.750
<i>I'm not ashamed.</i>

123
00:08:04.833 --> 00:08:07.250
<i>People screw us over all the time.</i>

124
00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:09.833
<i>Why should I pay a lot of money to eat?</i>

125
00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:17.166
<i>One scam after another has led me here.</i>

126
00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:20.166
<i>to the most important day of my life.</i>

127
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:25.875
Listen. this is the last time
I'm helping you with your scams. I'm done.

128
00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:27.375
Great.

129
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.083
Today is my last day. I'm done with you.

130
00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:32.625
You always say that.

131
00:08:32.708 --> 00:08:35.250
Then. a week later.
you ask me for a favor.

132
00:08:35.333 --> 00:08:36.458
I know you. Clóvis.

133
00:08:36.541 --> 00:08:38.333
I sold Christ. man.

134
00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:40.000
What?

135
00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:41.708
<i>Christ the Redeemer.</i>

136
00:08:41.791 --> 00:08:42.875
You're lying!

137
00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.666
Who's going to buy that statue?

138
00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:49.916
A crook. someone who wants
to benefit from the crisis.

139
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.375
I did Brazil a favor by taking money
from a corrupt businessman.

140
00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:56.208
Come on. Robin Hood.

141
00:08:56.291 --> 00:08:59.375
I'll say more.
You don't have the guts to do that.

142
00:08:59.458 --> 00:09:01.833
I'll show you. I have the documents.

143
00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.625
I dare you to say this is fake.

144
00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:08.916
I even created a website
with a code so they can check it.

145
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.625
It's all there.

146
00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:12.250
Have you no shame?

147
00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:13.583
No. none at all.

148
00:09:14.083 --> 00:09:18.166
I told them it is confidential
under the state secrecy law.

149
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.125
I said the government
won't disclose it yet to avoid protests.

150
00:09:22.208 --> 00:09:25.500
and the press is being paid. but will
denounce it later to play innocent.

151
00:09:25.583 --> 00:09:29.000
I asked for a bribe
for the mayor. for myself.

152
00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:31.333
for the governor and for myself again.

153
00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:33.500
so I can set him up with the deal.

154
00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:35.500
-Did they buy it?
-Of course.

155
00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:38.375
You can't trust a deal without bribery.

156
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.750
<i>A hundred years ago in Paris.</i>

157
00:09:40.833 --> 00:09:46.333
<i>a man tried to sell the Eiffel Tower</i>
<i>to one of the biggest scrap metal dealers.</i>

158
00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:47.875
<i>He was so successful</i>

159
00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.916
<i>that he went back to France</i>
<i>and sold it again.</i>

160
00:09:51.416 --> 00:09:54.208
<i>We are used to copying things from abroad.</i>

161
00:09:54.291 --> 00:09:57.666
<i>The Christ statue</i>
<i>was left unattended. so I sold it.</i>

162
00:09:58.166 --> 00:09:59.000
<i>I did.</i>

163
00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:00.000
SOLD

164
00:10:00.083 --> 00:10:04.083
<i>All I needed was</i>
<i>a corrupt man willing to make a deal.</i>

165
00:10:04.166 --> 00:10:06.125
<i>And there are many like</i> <i>him here.</i>

166
00:10:06.208 --> 00:10:07.333
Where is the money?

167
00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:12.000
-Now? In broad daylight?
-Don't worry. It's all good.

168
00:10:12.083 --> 00:10:15.958
People don't hide things anymore.
The more explicit. the better.

169
00:10:16.041 --> 00:10:17.625
Everything is for sale.

170
00:10:17.708 --> 00:10:20.458
The Amazon is no longer ours.

171
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:23.041
Not even a cricket
speaks Portuguese there.

172
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.625
Where is the money?

173
00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:30.041
Why are you hiding it?

174
00:10:30.125 --> 00:10:32.208
Give me that. Don't be suspicious.

175
00:10:32.291 --> 00:10:36.375
I loved this vase.
I'll take it. Don't mind me. Bye.

176
00:10:36.458 --> 00:10:39.125
<i>I have the solution for our people</i>

00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:42.666
<i>A good business like this</i>
<i>No one's ever seen</i>

178
00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:46.375
<i>Everything is ready</i>
<i>Just come and take it</i>

179
00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:49.958
<i>The solution is putting Brazil up for rent</i>

180
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:52.250
<i>We won't pay for anything</i>…

181
00:10:53.291 --> 00:10:55.791
<i>This country is a joke.</i>
<i>Why should I be serious?</i>

182
00:10:56.708 --> 00:10:58.750
<i>Come on. it was a good scam.</i>

183
00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:07.291
-You pulled it off!
-Yes! Thanks for the recognition.

184
00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:11.208
<i>Not to brag. but I totally rocked it.</i>

185
00:11:11.708 --> 00:11:14.375
<i>The foreigners will love it</i>

186
00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.250
<i>It's got the Atlantic and a sea view</i>…

187
00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:20.791
<i>After everything I went through.</i>
<i>all the trouble.</i>

188
00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:22.916
<i>I worked so hard.</i>

189
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.625
<i>and I was living</i>
<i>the best moment of my life.</i>

190
00:11:25.708 --> 00:11:27.500
<i>We won't pay for anything</i>

191
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.291
<i>We won't pay for anything</i>

192
00:11:31.166 --> 00:11:32.083
<i>It's all free</i>

193
00:11:32.166 --> 00:11:33.958
<i>It's time</i>

194
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.458
<i>But since poor people</i>
<i>can't be happy for long.</i>

195
00:11:40.541 --> 00:11:42.125
<i>everything changed.</i>

196
00:11:44.708 --> 00:11:45.583
Clóvis.

197
00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:47.291
Is your TV on?

198
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:48.750
Probably not.

199
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.166
Turn on the news. We're screwed.

200
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.958
{\an8}It was at this cafe

201
00:11:53.041 --> 00:11:56.583
{\an8}that the businessmen allegedly met a man

202
00:11:56.666 --> 00:11:58.833
who sold them Rio's <i>Christ the Redeemer</i>

203
00:11:59.541 --> 00:12:01.875
<i>under the false name of Lívio Romero.</i>

204
00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.791
<i>As you can see.</i>
<i>this is the sketch of the suspect.</i>

205
00:12:04.875 --> 00:12:09.083
For fuck's sake. man!

206
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.541
Hey. big guy! I need my car!

207
00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:16.791
<i>I'm sorry. Tavinho. but I need that car.</i>

208
00:12:26.916 --> 00:12:29.875
-Clóvis!
-I paid for it! You are my accomplice!

209
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.875
-What? Come on. Clóvis!
-Accomplice! That's right!

210
00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.458
<i>Now I'll get my money and get out of here.</i>

211
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.750
<i>However. the Senator</i>
<i>was faster than me and the cops.</i>

212
00:12:49.583 --> 00:12:52.041
<i>It's my fault for messing with them.</i>

213
00:12:52.541 --> 00:12:56.375
JUST GO AND BE HAPPY. SON
ART DOESN'T PAY

214
00:13:02.666 --> 00:13:04.458
<i>That man got back at me.</i>

215
00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.875
<i>He broke into my house</i>
<i>and took all my money.</i>

216
00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:14.458
<i>I needed to run away as fast as I could.</i>

217
00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:25.000
For fuck's sake! Did I kill you?

218
00:13:25.083 --> 00:13:27.416
Sorry. I can't help you right now.

219
00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:31.875
Lohane? Did you have to show up now?

220
00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.125
<i>You think he had a bad day? Imagine mine!</i>

221
00:13:35.208 --> 00:13:38.625
I serve the best breakfast of Magé.
Lohane's Point.

222
00:13:45.333 --> 00:13:48.000
BUY ONE BURGER AND GET A GLASS OF JUICE

223
00:13:50.541 --> 00:13:53.083
Burger coming right up!

224
00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:57.041
I also gave you 800 napkins.

225
00:13:57.125 --> 00:13:59.583
They're so cheap.
800 of them equals one good one.

226
00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:01.875
I can't afford the expensive ones.

227
00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.750
but I promise I'll buy them.

228
00:14:03.833 --> 00:14:06.708
-We have a delicious juice for free.
-Awesome!

229
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:10.583
Artificial cashew fruit flavor
never found in nature.

230
00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.916
But it might be pineapple.

231
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.083
It's delicious. So sweet!

232
00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:23.041
Keep laughing.
I'm working like a dog to survive.

233
00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:26.458
I work from Monday to Sunday.

234
00:14:26.541 --> 00:14:29.750
If I ever close this trailer.
it will be the end of me.

235
00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:31.333
The suffering never ends.

236
00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:35.833
It's hard. you know?

237
00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:37.708
What is?

238
00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:39.250
Life.

239
00:14:39.916 --> 00:14:41.916
Magé should be studied.

240
00:14:42.666 --> 00:14:43.916
What a hot place!

241
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.416
NASA should study it.

242
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.416
because I think
the sun is closer to here. for sure.

243
00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:52.458
I could fry a burger on the street.

244
00:14:52.541 --> 00:14:54.666
I don't do it. I have ethics.

245
00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:59.166
<i>But ethics is a complicated subject.</i>

246
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.000
-Good afternoon. All good here?
-Hi!

247
00:15:02.625 --> 00:15:04.375
Distinguished customers.

248
00:15:04.458 --> 00:15:08.416
I have Cheese-Lohane. Lohane-salad.
Chicken-Lohane and Lohane Light.

249
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.250
I hope you speak English.

250
00:15:10.916 --> 00:15:14.541
-What are you having?
-The trailer's business license.

251
00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:19.000
Well. this one…

252
00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:21.458
It's not on the menu. We're short on it.

253
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:26.083
You can't sell food without it.
I have to confiscate the trailer.

254
00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:27.000
No. sir.

255
00:15:27.541 --> 00:15:30.958
Please. don't. That's my business.

256
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:32.875
You'll destroy my life.

257
00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.666
Please. help me out!

258
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.500
Maybe. with some incentive…

259
00:15:39.208 --> 00:15:40.041
Get it?

260
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.416
-A sweetener?
-Yes.

261
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.791
A kickback. you know?

262
00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:48.083
To help me feed my children.

263
00:15:48.625 --> 00:15:49.458
I know.

264
00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.500
It's not sweet at all.

265
00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:55.750
Here. That's all I have.

266
00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:03.708
Well. it's not enough for me
and my friend Pantoja over there.

267
00:16:05.125 --> 00:16:06.250
So?

268
00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:07.875
I will…

269
00:16:08.833 --> 00:16:09.916
I'll look for more.

270
00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:20.000
This month's income.

271
00:16:20.583 --> 00:16:22.041
Now we're talking.

272
00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:23.208
Very sweet.

273
00:16:23.833 --> 00:16:24.875
Have a nice day.

274
00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:27.000
Let's go. Pantoja.

275
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.333
What was that?

276
00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:31.333
<i>What a situation!</i>

277
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:36.708
<i>I need a license. but it costs money.</i>
<i>so I need to work for it.</i>

278
00:16:36.791 --> 00:16:37.875
<i>It's crazy!</i>

279
00:16:38.416 --> 00:16:41.083
<i>I paid them. but I didn't lose my trailer.</i>

280
00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:44.458
<i>But poor people can't be happy for long.</i>

281
00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:46.041
<i>so everything changed.</i>

282
00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:48.750
Don't do that! I'm begging you!

283
00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:50.291
This trailer is my life!

284
00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:52.833
-Don't take it away!
-Calm down. ma'am.

285
00:16:52.916 --> 00:16:56.458
You're not allowed to sell food here.
we have to take it away.

286
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:58.458
Yes! I mean. no!

287
00:16:58.541 --> 00:17:00.083
Is it a yes or a no?

288
00:17:00.166 --> 00:17:04.416
Yes. I don't have a license.
but you can't take my trailer away.

289
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.916
I already sorted it out
with your friend who came by.

290
00:17:09.208 --> 00:17:10.041
-Friend?
-Yes!

291
00:17:10.125 --> 00:17:13.166
-I have no friends. What about you?
-No friends.

292
00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:22.958
Fake inspectors?

293
00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:25.541
Yes. there are a lot of them.

294
00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:28.250
They take money from people like you.

295
00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:31.666
-You're a victim.
-Not exactly a victim. actually.

296
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.291
If you hadn't paid them.
they would've gone away.

297
00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:38.916
-But you'll take it?
-Yes. but you'd still have your money.

298
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Let's go. Santos.

299
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.625
<i>Alone. with no trailer and no money.</i>

300
00:17:46.541 --> 00:17:47.791
<i>I had nothing left.</i>

301
00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:51.750
<i>I mean…</i>

302
00:17:52.583 --> 00:17:53.791
<i>almost nothing.</i>

303
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:01.041
<i>I needed to go to Rio.</i>

304
00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:03.166
I'm going to Rio. Jerusa!

305
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.250
<i>In search of the only person</i>
<i>who could help me.</i>

306
00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:07.250
<i>my brother.</i>

307
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.000
<i>He's always been discreet.</i>
<i>but I thought he'd done well in life.</i>

308
00:18:14.541 --> 00:18:16.458
<i>that he'd made it in a big city.</i>

309
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.791
<i>He was doing better than me.</i>

310
00:18:21.125 --> 00:18:24.375
For fuck's sake!

311
00:18:24.458 --> 00:18:25.500
Did I kill you?

312
00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:30.041
Lohane?

313
00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:31.333
Clóvis!

314
00:18:31.416 --> 00:18:33.125
Did you have to show up now?

315
00:18:35.708 --> 00:18:37.791
Wait! Clóvis!

316
00:18:39.625 --> 00:18:41.500
Thank you. Lord!

317
00:18:42.291 --> 00:18:44.166
Clóvis!

318
00:18:48.458 --> 00:18:51.666
Why are you in such a hurry?
You didn't give me a kiss.

319
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:53.875
Are you late?

320
00:18:54.875 --> 00:18:58.166
Focusing on traffic to avoid answering me.

321
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.791
Talk to the driver only when necessary.

322
00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:08.000
Are you going away?

323
00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:12.958
You don't need to answer.
I don't wanna know.

324
00:19:16.333 --> 00:19:18.458
I thought you had a nicer car.

325
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:20.458
I'm not judging you or anything.

326
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:24.958
It's just that we always think
other people are doing well.

327
00:19:25.041 --> 00:19:28.791
I'm not saying you're not.
You're doing better than me.

328
00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:32.166
-But worse than I thought.
-Can't you see I'm focused?

329
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.916
I'm sorry. Relax.

330
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.291
You look like Wesley Safadão.

331
00:19:36.916 --> 00:19:39.416
Because of the hair. I guess.

332
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.166
Your nickname in school
was Clóvis Bornay. remember?

333
00:19:45.416 --> 00:19:47.708
By the way. where are we going?

334
00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:51.333
Can you talk now? I need to talk.

335
00:19:51.416 --> 00:19:52.250
No.

336
00:19:57.791 --> 00:20:01.833
We've been driving for hours.
Where are you taking me? I'm curious.

337
00:20:02.416 --> 00:20:04.916
{\an8}LAKES REGION

338
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.625
This could be considered kidnapping.

339
00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.666
Yes. we've been driving for hours.

340
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.708
No. this is not a kidnapping.

341
00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:17.458
I didn't take you against your will.
You entered my car.

342
00:20:17.541 --> 00:20:18.875
Get out. please.

343
00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:22.500
-You're so rude!
-I'm not rude.

344
00:20:22.583 --> 00:20:24.666
I said "please." Get out. please.

345
00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:27.708
-You haven't seen me in ages!
-Get out.

346
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.750
-Clóvis. I need your help.
-Get out!

347
00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:34.250
-I'm in trouble!
-And you think I'm not?

348
00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:36.000
I'm in deep shit. dear.

349
00:20:36.083 --> 00:20:37.666
I'm up to my neck in shit.

350
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:38.875
Not as bad as me.

351
00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:42.041
-I'm in trouble with the cops!
-Not interested. Move.

352
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.750
Listen up. Clóvis. I have a trailer.

353
00:20:45.833 --> 00:20:49.541
I had one. but the cops confiscated it
for not having a license.

354
00:20:49.625 --> 00:20:54.291
Before that there was another raid.
and I bribed them. but they were fake!

355
00:20:54.375 --> 00:20:57.166
Now I have no money and no trailer!

356
00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.583
I have no other way to make a living.

357
00:21:00.083 --> 00:21:04.250
Then I thought my brother could help me.
I'll pay you back.

358
00:21:04.333 --> 00:21:06.625
I have no money. How could I help you?

359
00:21:10.875 --> 00:21:11.750
I understand.

360
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:14.125
Crooks are everywhere.

361
00:21:14.791 --> 00:21:17.541
You might not believe me.
but I can prove it.

362
00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:18.708
I'll show you.

363
00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:29.875
You're a criminal?

364
00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:33.541
I'm a con artist.
a schemer. not a criminal.

365
00:21:34.125 --> 00:21:34.958
You…

366
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.541
You're just like the scammers
that extorted me. aren't you?

367
00:21:39.625 --> 00:21:40.916
No. I have ethics.

368
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.625
My own ethics. but I do.

369
00:21:42.708 --> 00:21:45.625
I'd never steal a trailer
from an honest worker.

370
00:21:45.708 --> 00:21:48.458
Man. I want nothing to do with you.

371
00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:50.208
No way.

372
00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:52.750
As a matter of fact. #downwithclóvis.

373
00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:54.916
You shouldn't even have come.

374
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.333
Good luck. Bye.

375
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.208
Absolutely not.

376
00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:04.750
I won't ask a crook for help.

377
00:22:04.833 --> 00:22:08.250
I lost my trailer. but I won't do it.

378
00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:10.458
The world is already full of crooks.

379
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:12.416
This country is full of crooks.

380
00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.375
You don't need me?

381
00:22:15.041 --> 00:22:16.375
I don't need you!

382
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:21.625
Actually. I do.

383
00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:24.833
But God will help me.

384
00:22:28.625 --> 00:22:30.208
Just not yet.

385
00:22:31.833 --> 00:22:35.041
Eventually. He will.
I don't know when. but He will.

386
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.000
I don't deserve this.

387
00:22:39.416 --> 00:22:40.833
I'm completely lost.

388
00:22:46.083 --> 00:22:47.416
That's Clóvis!

389
00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:52.666
-I don't have all day. Where are they?
-I'll find the documents.

390
00:22:53.208 --> 00:22:54.250
My gosh!

391
00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:56.708
What should I do?

392
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.208
I can't find them.
They must be somewhere else.

393
00:23:01.291 --> 00:23:02.208
HIGHWAY PATROL

394
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.125
Come back here. you bastard!

395
00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:15.750
I'm talking to you. scumbag! Asshole!

396
00:23:17.166 --> 00:23:18.250
Prick!

397
00:23:19.791 --> 00:23:20.833
Coward!

398
00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:23.958
You're a lying monster!

399
00:23:24.708 --> 00:23:26.958
You should've never been born!

400
00:23:27.541 --> 00:23:30.250
Sorry. I'll let you do your job
in a minute.

401
00:23:30.333 --> 00:23:32.083
Wait. who are you?

402
00:23:32.166 --> 00:23:33.041
Me?

403
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:38.708
I'm the idiot who fell for his sweet talk!

404
00:23:39.333 --> 00:23:41.500
You won't believe this.

405
00:23:42.958 --> 00:23:45.833
This man showed up at my dad's house

406
00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:48.250
and disgraced me!

407
00:23:51.583 --> 00:23:54.166
Okay. it was consensual.

408
00:23:55.208 --> 00:23:57.625
but he used me and ran away.

409
00:23:57.708 --> 00:23:58.833
It's not right!

410
00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:01.166
-Calm down. ma'am.
-Don't call me that!

411
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.666
It reminds me of a book
I was forced to read when I was a kid.

412
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:07.166
But I didn’t.

413
00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:08.958
I flunked out.

414
00:24:09.541 --> 00:24:11.916
-No. don't do that!
-She's hitting me.

415
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.875
Do you feel sorry for him?

416
00:24:13.958 --> 00:24:17.791
You know what? Arrest me.
Take me away from society.

417
00:24:17.875 --> 00:24:20.375
Just don't make me
live with this crazy woman.

418
00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:23.041
She's crazy. You can all see that!

419
00:24:23.125 --> 00:24:25.291
He wants to be taken away

420
00:24:25.375 --> 00:24:29.333
because he doesn't want
to take responsibility as a father.

421
00:24:29.916 --> 00:24:33.000
-He doesn't want to raise his own child!
-What child?

422
00:24:33.083 --> 00:24:36.125
This one! Inside my belly.

423
00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:39.583
Since when is that a child?
That's a tapeworm!

424
00:24:39.666 --> 00:24:41.750
Do you want me to raise a tapeworm?

425
00:24:41.833 --> 00:24:44.333
Do you want me to christen a tapeworm?

426
00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:46.083
-It's a joke!
-My baby!

427
00:24:46.666 --> 00:24:50.541
Your dad is calling you names
before you're even born!

428
00:24:50.625 --> 00:24:54.666
Do you want the officer here
to force me to pay child support?

429
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.125
-I do! Of course!
-Your mother is crazy!

430
00:24:57.208 --> 00:24:58.708
She is. trust your dad!

431
00:24:58.791 --> 00:24:59.916
You are crazy!

432
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.333
You don't even know
if the baby is really yours!

433
00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:06.500
You are both insane!
Go fight somewhere else!

434
00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:09.916
No! Now I want to work this out.

435
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.458
-No. sir! We are not doing anything here.
-We're going to work this out!

436
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:17.583
I want to work this out. brother. Got it?

437
00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:20.500
-I want to work this out!
-Enough!

438
00:25:20.583 --> 00:25:21.833
Enough!

439
00:25:21.916 --> 00:25:23.500
Move along. please.

440
00:25:23.583 --> 00:25:26.333
before I change my mind and arrest you.

441
00:25:26.416 --> 00:25:28.416
-Got it?
-Yes. you're right.

442
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.458
Please.

443
00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:31.875
-Before my water breaks.
-Chill out.

444
00:25:31.958 --> 00:25:33.791
-It's all right. relax.
-Move.

445
00:25:33.875 --> 00:25:35.000
Everything is fine.

446
00:25:35.916 --> 00:25:37.708
I gotta hit the waves today.

447
00:25:47.666 --> 00:25:49.708
The tapeworm was a genius move.

448
00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:52.166
You couldn't believe it when I said that.

449
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.958
I can't believe how you. Clóvis.

450
00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:57.583
such a quiet and shy boy.

451
00:25:57.666 --> 00:25:59.458
turned into a gangster.

452
00:26:00.208 --> 00:26:01.875
I was bullied. honey.

453
00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:04.291
Bullied! I was bullied.

454
00:26:04.375 --> 00:26:06.458
Lady Gaga was bullied. Madonna was.

455
00:26:06.541 --> 00:26:08.666
I heard Tom Cruise was bullied. too.

456
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.458
All amazing people. like me.

457
00:26:10.541 --> 00:26:12.375
Thanks. bullying!

458
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.916
When I was good. I got screwed.

459
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.500
Now I'm bad. and things work out.
Isn't it better?

460
00:26:18.166 --> 00:26:19.000
Maybe.

461
00:26:19.833 --> 00:26:22.250
Look at you. You just fooled the police.

462
00:26:22.333 --> 00:26:23.791
You'll get me a trailer.

463
00:26:23.875 --> 00:26:25.333
-What?
-You heard me.

464
00:26:25.416 --> 00:26:27.916
I saved you. Now you'll get me a trailer.

465
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.833
Blackmail?

466
00:26:28.916 --> 00:26:30.458
You're my brother. Clóvis.

467
00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:33.875
I have nothing left.
Could you help me out?

468
00:26:40.875 --> 00:26:41.875
Okay.

469
00:26:42.833 --> 00:26:44.666
I'll figure something out.

470
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.166
But after that. we'll part ways.

471
00:26:48.583 --> 00:26:50.500
Get off me. No!

472
00:26:53.083 --> 00:26:54.875
<i>What are you doing?</i>

473
00:26:54.958 --> 00:26:56.166
Making a reservation.

474
00:26:57.833 --> 00:26:59.583
Without any money in it?

475
00:27:00.458 --> 00:27:02.500
Let me explain one thing to you.

476
00:27:02.583 --> 00:27:04.041
I need my trailer.

477
00:27:04.125 --> 00:27:06.875
but I assumed you would get one honestly.

478
00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:09.166
You really did?

479
00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:10.250
How nice.

480
00:27:10.333 --> 00:27:12.333
Relax. it's just a magic trick.

481
00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:16.541
Instead of pulling a rabbit out of my hat.
I'll pull it out of someone else's hat.

482
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.083
I won't stay here. Forget it.

483
00:27:29.166 --> 00:27:30.625
I have dignity.

484
00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:32.916
Great. because I'll stay.

485
00:27:38.166 --> 00:27:39.000
What's up?

486
00:27:39.083 --> 00:27:40.791
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

487
00:27:40.875 --> 00:27:42.916
-Do you have a reservation?
-I do.

488
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.583
-How are you doing?
-Great.

489
00:27:44.666 --> 00:27:46.791
It's under the name Máximo Marques.

490
00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:48.916
I made a deposit earlier.

491
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.625
I had a problem with my online account.
and I made the deposit at the bank.

492
00:27:53.708 --> 00:27:54.666
So annoying.

493
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.750
I found it. You paid for ten days
in the premium suite.

494
00:27:58.833 --> 00:27:59.666
Very good.

495
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:04.208
However. the deposit will be credited
only on Monday.

496
00:28:05.833 --> 00:28:06.916
So?

497
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.833
I can't rest after a long trip
because banks don't open on weekends?

498
00:28:11.916 --> 00:28:16.208
That's not what I mean. sir.
Technically. it hasn't been paid yet.

499
00:28:16.791 --> 00:28:18.875
But I made the deposit.

500
00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:20.416
It's really weird.

501
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.333
Our money is promptly debited
when we transfer it.

502
00:28:23.416 --> 00:28:28.875
but when we make a deposit.
it takes a long time to clear.

503
00:28:28.958 --> 00:28:30.416
Banks love to credit it.

504
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.416
they take forever to do so.

505
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.750
Then. I ask you:

506
00:28:33.833 --> 00:28:36.250
If my money hasn't been transferred.

507
00:28:36.333 --> 00:28:37.583
where is it?

508
00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:41.208
Yes. that is a good question.

509
00:28:41.291 --> 00:28:44.333
Thank God.
who never rests for a single day.

510
00:28:44.416 --> 00:28:45.916
we are honest people.

511
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.208
-Right?
-Amen.

512
00:28:47.291 --> 00:28:49.375
I'm here on business. I'm tired.

513
00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:51.166
I work on weekends. unlike banks.

514
00:28:52.583 --> 00:28:54.916
I just need my room keys. please.

515
00:28:55.583 --> 00:28:56.750
Of course.

516
00:28:59.541 --> 00:29:01.291
-Here they are.
-Great.

517
00:29:01.375 --> 00:29:04.083
Clóvis. I don't agree
with the things you do.

518
00:29:04.166 --> 00:29:06.375
Really? That's your problem.

519
00:29:06.458 --> 00:29:08.333
But I'm loving this.

520
00:29:08.416 --> 00:29:10.666
-How are you doing?
-Hi.

521
00:29:11.625 --> 00:29:13.375
I never go anywhere.

522
00:29:14.125 --> 00:29:16.958
You need time and money to travel.

523
00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:21.000
A worker with time is unemployed.
so there's no money left to travel.

524
00:29:21.083 --> 00:29:23.083
It just doesn't add up. Clóvis.

525
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.708
The only trip I've been making
is to get the fake mayo I serve.

526
00:29:27.791 --> 00:29:31.541
You serve fake mayonnaise. how nice!

527
00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:34.583
Otherwise. I'd have no mayonnaise to sell.

528
00:29:34.666 --> 00:29:38.416
My dream is to be able to serve
a fancy mayonnaise

529
00:29:39.083 --> 00:29:40.333
and thick napkins.

530
00:29:40.416 --> 00:29:42.416
You're annoying. You talk a lot.

531
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.750
Don't be like that.

532
00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:46.708
This place is so beautiful. right?

533
00:29:46.791 --> 00:29:47.625
No.

534
00:29:48.958 --> 00:29:52.208
I'm in love.

535
00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:54.833
-Give me your number!
-Where are you going?

536
00:29:54.916 --> 00:29:57.125
Following those fishes. I'm a shark.

537
00:29:57.625 --> 00:29:59.750
-Come back here.
-Where are we going?

538
00:29:59.833 --> 00:30:02.500
I'll buy you some clothes.
Those are awful.

539
00:30:02.583 --> 00:30:06.875
I never thought you were capable
of doing things like this. Clóvis.

540
00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:11.541
-I refuse to go in.
-Shut up. Come on.

541
00:30:12.875 --> 00:30:14.333
Hello. how are you doing?

542
00:30:14.416 --> 00:30:16.333
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

543
00:30:16.416 --> 00:30:18.625
I brought my sister for a shopping spree.

544
00:30:18.708 --> 00:30:21.625
Not just a spree.
she needs to go on a binge.

545
00:30:21.708 --> 00:30:23.958
She needs a complete makeover.

546
00:30:24.666 --> 00:30:26.125
I love that dress.

547
00:30:30.166 --> 00:30:31.000
Jesus Christ!

548
00:30:31.083 --> 00:30:32.583
What's her size? Small?

549
00:30:32.666 --> 00:30:36.166
No. it's small. medium and large.
She's all lopsided.

550
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.333
One thigh is bigger than the other.

551
00:30:38.416 --> 00:30:40.916
one breast is bigger. her butt's weird.

552
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.833
Asymmetrical.

553
00:30:41.916 --> 00:30:46.500
If you compared her to an anatomy book.
you'd see she's an alien.

554
00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:50.416
If you laid her down naked.
at first you'd be confused.

555
00:30:51.666 --> 00:30:55.000
I got it. silly.
Could you get me a coffee?

556
00:30:55.083 --> 00:30:57.041
-You scared me!
-One more.

557
00:30:57.125 --> 00:30:58.666
-I can't!
-You can!

558
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.708
And don't argue with me.

559
00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:05.083
Leave those and return some pieces.
Tell her you won't buy anything.

560
00:31:05.166 --> 00:31:08.166
No! Lord. forgive me!

561
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.916
It's not my fault! I'm so sorry!

562
00:31:30.541 --> 00:31:33.291
So. I guess I won't take anything.

563
00:31:33.375 --> 00:31:36.708
Come on! At least one piece.

564
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:37.708
He's right.

565
00:31:37.791 --> 00:31:40.666
Nothing really fits me. thank you.

566
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.750
You're upset because you got fat.

567
00:31:43.416 --> 00:31:45.958
I retain water in my upper body.

568
00:31:46.041 --> 00:31:48.041
She's feeling bad about herself.

569
00:31:48.125 --> 00:31:50.541
We must buy dream clothes.

570
00:31:50.625 --> 00:31:54.666
those clothes you swear
you'll lose weight to wear one day.

571
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.583
I have lots of them at home.

572
00:31:56.666 --> 00:31:58.583
-Bye!
-They'll fit me someday.

573
00:31:58.666 --> 00:32:02.041
-Let's go. please.
-You're full of security tags.

574
00:32:02.125 --> 00:32:04.666
If you pass the detector.
you might explode.

575
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.750
My God. I can't go to jail!

576
00:32:06.833 --> 00:32:09.916
Relax. we got this. We just have to wait.

577
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:17.208
Now. come on.

578
00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:20.333
-I can't believe it.
-Good luck.

579
00:32:20.416 --> 00:32:21.833
She won't buy anything.

580
00:32:21.916 --> 00:32:24.000
She needs to see her shrink.

581
00:32:24.083 --> 00:32:25.916
-Thanks for the magazine.
-Sure!

582
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.583
That poor tourist.

583
00:32:29.666 --> 00:32:32.750
It's every man for himself in Brazil.

584
00:32:32.833 --> 00:32:35.083
That car ran the light. and it's gone.

585
00:32:35.166 --> 00:32:36.916
The one who didn't is far behind.

586
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.708
It did the right thing.
We gotta respect it.

587
00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:43.291
I found an honest Brazilian!
I've never seen one.

588
00:32:43.375 --> 00:32:45.041
I'll alert the media.

589
00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:47.833
If it's your third time. you get a song.

590
00:32:47.916 --> 00:32:53.083
Man. you framed an innocent person
and made our country look bad.

591
00:32:53.166 --> 00:32:55.541
Brazil already has a bad reputation.

592
00:32:55.625 --> 00:32:59.166
The cameras will show
that I placed the clothes in her bag.

593
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.541
and she'll be okay.

594
00:33:00.625 --> 00:33:02.541
How could you?

595
00:33:02.625 --> 00:33:05.916
Not having money. that's how I did it.

596
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.250
Let's keep an eye out.

597
00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:09.791
They'll come after us.
and I've only just started.

598
00:33:09.875 --> 00:33:12.208
BOAT RIDES

599
00:33:17.125 --> 00:33:18.958
Wasn't this supposed to be fast?

600
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.833
We've been here for hours.
I'm on my fifth slushy.

601
00:33:22.916 --> 00:33:26.375
We're studying the area.
Do you see that boat ride agency?

602
00:33:26.458 --> 00:33:28.041
They only take cash or checks.

603
00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:31.708
We must wait
for someone to pay with a check.

604
00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:33.916
take a picture of the signature.

605
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.541
then forge a new check
and exchange it with the original.

606
00:33:36.625 --> 00:33:39.333
-Robbing a bank is easier.
-And we will.

607
00:33:39.416 --> 00:33:41.458
-Rob a bank?
-Yes.

608
00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:45.250
That woman looks like
she's going to rent a boat.

609
00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:47.458
-Go over there.
-To do what?

610
00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:50.166
-Take a picture of the check!
-How?

611
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:52.375
Figure it out and bring it to me.

612
00:33:52.458 --> 00:33:54.416
Okay. hold it. God. help me.

613
00:33:56.333 --> 00:34:01.375
There's also Forte Beach.
which is our most famous beach.

614
00:34:01.458 --> 00:34:03.791
And our special trips. like Peró Beach.

615
00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:06.375
We have a 16-foot speedboat

616
00:34:06.458 --> 00:34:09.041
and a schooner that will be leaving soon.

617
00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:11.625
but we still have tickets for this trip.

618
00:34:12.625 --> 00:34:14.916
-Hi.
-Hi. I'm checking this mask out.

619
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.916
If I wear this mask.
I'll scare all the fishes.

620
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.166
I'll clear out the ocean.

621
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.875
Like an extinction.

622
00:34:23.625 --> 00:34:27.666
Let me ask you.
Do you only have rides with 500 people?

623
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:28.833
-No. we--
-What?

624
00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:34.791
Sorry. That's the fun part.
500 people falling on each other.

625
00:34:34.875 --> 00:34:37.041
I like it better that way. I prefer that.

626
00:34:37.125 --> 00:34:40.291
Do you have something more exclusive?

627
00:34:40.375 --> 00:34:42.083
Like a boat or a yacht?

628
00:34:42.166 --> 00:34:45.333
You could buy all the tickets
of a medium ride

629
00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:46.625
and take your friends.

630
00:34:46.708 --> 00:34:48.416
Great. How much is that?

631
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.333
-A thousand reais.
-A thousand reais?

632
00:34:50.416 --> 00:34:51.458
Yeah. a thousand.

633
00:34:51.541 --> 00:34:54.958
To be on a boat alone.
without a single guy to flirt with?

634
00:34:56.166 --> 00:34:59.166
Well. I saw a sailor over there
with huge feet.

635
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:02.916
Imagine him pulling the anchor
with those strong arms.

636
00:35:03.583 --> 00:35:04.833
Smart girl!

637
00:35:05.583 --> 00:35:06.791
I like-- Sorry.

638
00:35:06.875 --> 00:35:08.708
Sorry. this is a private deal.

639
00:35:08.791 --> 00:35:10.875
-Do you take credit cards?
-I'll take a selfie.

640
00:35:10.958 --> 00:35:13.208
-No. just cash or check.
-Okay.

641
00:35:14.041 --> 00:35:16.333
-Great lighting.
-It's a beautiful day.

642
00:35:16.416 --> 00:35:17.833
It's wonderful.

643
00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:19.708
Very good.

644
00:35:20.875 --> 00:35:23.833
This is a good angle. Sorry.

645
00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:28.875
Some people don't know when to stop.

646
00:35:30.041 --> 00:35:34.125
Are you talking to me? Look at me. then.
Why are you looking at her?

647
00:35:34.208 --> 00:35:36.458
Such a snob. What an awful establishment!

648
00:35:36.541 --> 00:35:39.041
A seedy place with a smelly dog.

649
00:35:39.125 --> 00:35:40.708
Your dog is filthy.

650
00:35:40.791 --> 00:35:43.875
My goodness. that smell!

651
00:35:43.958 --> 00:35:46.833
What an awful establishment! My goodness.

652
00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:55.666
-Hello! Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon. how are you?

653
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:58.333
I hope you're doing fine. because I'm not.

654
00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:00.333
My boss is pissed.

655
00:36:00.416 --> 00:36:03.166
I didn't introduce myself. I'm Wendell.

656
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:07.875
I'm Silvia's driver.
who has just rented a boat. actually.

657
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:10.416
-That lady.
-Exactly. Is your boss nice?

658
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.708
They never are.

659
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:14.500
But it's not your fault.
It was a girl taking selfies.

660
00:36:14.583 --> 00:36:15.458
Do you like them?

661
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:16.791
I'm fine with them.

662
00:36:16.875 --> 00:36:18.875
but that girl kept talking.

663
00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:23.666
Do you get confused with fast speaking?
I don't. but my boss does.

664
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:26.958
She made my boss confuse the checks.

665
00:36:27.041 --> 00:36:31.041
She gave you the wrong one
and asked me to get it back

666
00:36:31.125 --> 00:36:32.708
and give you this one.

667
00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:33.666
-Okay?
-Right.

668
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.291
It's all the same.
but the bank is different.

669
00:36:36.791 --> 00:36:39.833
-All right. then.
-Could you hurry up?

670
00:36:39.916 --> 00:36:42.666
She's waiting outside.
and she's in a terrible mood.

671
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:44.541
-You know?
-Yes.

672
00:36:45.375 --> 00:36:48.750
-Impatient. She's…
-I'll just check it.

673
00:36:48.833 --> 00:36:51.125
-It's all the same but the bank.
-Okay.

674
00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:52.583
-All right.
-Awesome.

675
00:36:52.666 --> 00:36:54.791
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

676
00:36:55.416 --> 00:36:56.875
<i>Eleven thousand reais.</i>

677
00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:01.625
The number 11 is too squeezed up.

678
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.000
Sorry. but I can't.

679
00:37:04.083 --> 00:37:07.333
-Hi. how are you? Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

680
00:37:07.416 --> 00:37:11.000
So. what does it say on there?
"Eleven thousand reais." right?

681
00:37:11.791 --> 00:37:13.125
So. that's what it is.

682
00:37:13.208 --> 00:37:15.666
And it's urgent. I need this money.

683
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.458
But first I need to contact the issuer.

684
00:37:18.541 --> 00:37:21.583
It's someone who suffers from Parkinson's.
Have you heard of it?

685
00:37:22.583 --> 00:37:25.083
I really need the bank's confirmation.

686
00:37:25.166 --> 00:37:26.041
All right.

687
00:37:26.125 --> 00:37:28.750
Ladies and gentlemen.
your attention. please.

688
00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:32.208
Sorry to bother you.
but I need to say something.

689
00:37:32.291 --> 00:37:35.916
The bank takes our money
but never gets us off. you know?

690
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:40.333
My Aunt Silvia. who raised me.
has Parkinson's.

691
00:37:41.208 --> 00:37:45.583
The poor thing insisted
on using her own frail hands

692
00:37:45.666 --> 00:37:47.333
to write the check.

693
00:37:47.416 --> 00:37:52.041
She felt alive. she felt useful.
she felt active. you know?

694
00:37:52.125 --> 00:37:55.791
Because the check is a donation
from her to a child in need.

695
00:37:55.875 --> 00:37:59.083
However. she says her handwriting is bad.

696
00:37:59.166 --> 00:38:01.250
Of course. she has Parkinson's!

697
00:38:01.333 --> 00:38:03.916
-The number is squeezed up.
-You're lying!

698
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.750
-I didn't say anything!
-Really?

699
00:38:06.833 --> 00:38:10.791
Now she didn't say anything.
She prefers the silence of cowardice.

700
00:38:10.875 --> 00:38:14.583
That's not on her behalf.
She's acting on the bank's behalf.

701
00:38:14.666 --> 00:38:18.500
She's not sparing her money.
She's sparing the bank's money!

702
00:38:18.583 --> 00:38:20.291
Does the bank spare us?

703
00:38:20.375 --> 00:38:22.583
-No!
-No. it doesn't!

704
00:38:22.666 --> 00:38:24.458
I wanna be a bank in my next life.

705
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:27.916
They're always forgiven.
but they never forgive anybody.

706
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.666
Look at the special treatment line.

707
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:32.083
Especially slow!

708
00:38:32.166 --> 00:38:36.041
It is outrageous to make seniors wait.

709
00:38:36.125 --> 00:38:38.666
It's horrible. They are elderly!

710
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:42.041
Have you ever heard of the fourth age?

711
00:38:42.125 --> 00:38:44.125
No? Why? Because it doesn't exist!

712
00:38:44.666 --> 00:38:46.541
The third age is the last one!

713
00:38:46.625 --> 00:38:50.583
Every minute of their lives
is precious. you see?

714
00:38:50.666 --> 00:38:54.166
One of them might pass away right here.

715
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.166
Look at her. eating anxiously.

716
00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:00.625
She's all anxious.
eating cookies. nonstop chewing.

717
00:39:00.708 --> 00:39:02.625
Her anxiety is the bank's fault.

718
00:39:02.708 --> 00:39:04.583
She stands there for hours.

719
00:39:04.666 --> 00:39:06.375
so she eats to pass the time.

720
00:39:06.458 --> 00:39:10.208
She was thin when she came in here.
Look at her now.

721
00:39:10.291 --> 00:39:12.541
She might explode right here.

722
00:39:12.625 --> 00:39:16.708
How about the revolving doors?
They are hell on Earth!

723
00:39:16.791 --> 00:39:20.375
We even give up coming in
for fear of getting stuck.

724
00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:22.166
They treat us like criminals.

725
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:23.875
We become criminals.

726
00:39:23.958 --> 00:39:26.125
We take out our phones. keys. everything.

727
00:39:26.208 --> 00:39:27.750
They ask for our pacemakers.

728
00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:30.833
Someone might have
a heart attack right here.

729
00:39:30.916 --> 00:39:34.500
And it's all the bank's fault!

730
00:39:34.583 --> 00:39:35.916
That's right!

731
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.333
We want respect!

732
00:39:39.833 --> 00:39:43.333
Respect! We want respect!

733
00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:47.791
Listen. I'm not holding up the line
because I want to.

734
00:39:47.875 --> 00:39:49.541
They won't cash my check.

735
00:39:49.625 --> 00:39:51.083
Cash it!

736
00:39:51.166 --> 00:39:53.333
Cash his check!

737
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.791
Listen to the voice of experience.
He is very experienced.

738
00:39:57.875 --> 00:39:59.541
Cash his check already!

739
00:39:59.625 --> 00:40:02.666
Even our chubby friend agrees.
I can say that. I'm chubby too.

740
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:04.916
Cash it already!

741
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.833
-Cash his check!
-Cash it!

742
00:40:08.916 --> 00:40:11.375
The giant has awakened.

743
00:40:11.458 --> 00:40:15.791
<i>Giant by thine own nature</i>

744
00:40:15.875 --> 00:40:19.291
<i>Thou art beautiful. strong</i>
<i>A fearless colossus</i>

745
00:40:19.375 --> 00:40:22.708
<i>And thy future mirrors that greatness</i>

746
00:40:22.791 --> 00:40:24.416
<i>Adored land</i>

747
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.208
<i>Amongst a thousand others</i>
<i>Art thou. Brazil. beloved homeland</i>

748
00:40:28.291 --> 00:40:31.125
<i>Of the sons of this ground</i>
<i>Thou art kind mother</i>

749
00:40:31.208 --> 00:40:33.291
<i>Beloved homeland. Brazil!</i>

750
00:40:35.791 --> 00:40:36.791
Yeah!

751
00:40:39.666 --> 00:40:44.208
-Cash it!
-Cash it!

752
00:40:44.791 --> 00:40:45.791
I've got goosebumps.

753
00:40:48.166 --> 00:40:50.166
Didn't I say I'd rob a bank?

754
00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.541
-You robbed Silvia!
-What?

755
00:40:52.625 --> 00:40:54.458
She is the victim of a scam.

756
00:40:54.541 --> 00:40:57.291
The bank's loss is our gain.

757
00:40:57.375 --> 00:41:01.000
Eleven thousand reais. man!

758
00:41:01.083 --> 00:41:03.500
I've never seen so much money in my life!

759
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.750
-What's my share?
-None.

760
00:41:06.375 --> 00:41:08.166
You're getting greedy.

761
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:10.666
I'll buy your trailer tomorrow.

762
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:12.166
And then what?

763
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.625
Then we'll part ways. as we agreed.

764
00:41:14.708 --> 00:41:15.541
No.

765
00:41:16.041 --> 00:41:17.875
I won't accept that.

766
00:41:17.958 --> 00:41:20.833
Didn't you come after me to get a trailer?

767
00:41:20.916 --> 00:41:25.375
So. let's go out. have some fun.
When was the last time we did that?

768
00:41:25.458 --> 00:41:27.291
There's a party near the hotel.

769
00:41:27.375 --> 00:41:30.041
No way. the entire city is after us.

770
00:41:31.416 --> 00:41:32.625
Where are you going?

771
00:41:33.125 --> 00:41:36.833
To the sauna. to relax after a hard day.

772
00:41:36.916 --> 00:41:39.916
Sauna? Let's party. man!

773
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.750
No party. Lohane.

774
00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:43.458
We're done for today.

775
00:41:43.541 --> 00:41:45.708
I'll go to the sauna.
and you'll go to bed.

776
00:41:45.791 --> 00:41:48.041
-You'll lie down and rest.
-I will not!

777
00:41:48.125 --> 00:41:51.125
Because a woman of your age.
in your situation.

778
00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:52.375
is all wrong.

779
00:41:52.458 --> 00:41:54.541
What about my age?

780
00:41:55.791 --> 00:41:56.875
Clóvis?

781
00:41:58.041 --> 00:41:59.958
Clóvis. open the door!

782
00:42:00.041 --> 00:42:01.333
Clóvis!

783
00:42:10.625 --> 00:42:11.791
Lohane?

784
00:42:12.416 --> 00:42:13.291
Lohane.

785
00:42:13.916 --> 00:42:15.250
We need to talk.

786
00:42:16.375 --> 00:42:17.875
Lohane. answer me.

787
00:42:18.583 --> 00:42:19.583
Lohane.

788
00:42:21.125 --> 00:42:23.750
No way! I can't believe it!

789
00:42:33.791 --> 00:42:34.875
Lohane?

790
00:42:34.958 --> 00:42:36.708
Are you hitting on my wife?

791
00:42:36.791 --> 00:42:37.750
Are you serious?

792
00:42:37.833 --> 00:42:40.541
I won't even answer that. Look at me!

793
00:42:40.625 --> 00:42:42.041
I don't know your wife!

794
00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:45.333
Do you know why? She is a woman!
I'm not interested.

795
00:42:45.416 --> 00:42:46.500
Please.

796
00:42:47.833 --> 00:42:49.083
Where's that weirdo?

797
00:42:50.583 --> 00:42:53.791
-There she is. I found you!
-Ouch! Stop it!

798
00:42:53.875 --> 00:42:56.291
-Fugitive!
-I thought you were robbing me.

799
00:42:56.375 --> 00:42:57.833
Where are you going?

800
00:42:57.916 --> 00:43:00.166
I'm trying to get us in the party.

801
00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:03.291
-This lame party?
-Wait a minute. Clóvis!

802
00:43:03.375 --> 00:43:06.250
-Back to the hotel now!
-You're hurting me!

803
00:43:06.333 --> 00:43:09.250
-But I wanna go to the party!
-Stop it. girl.

804
00:43:09.333 --> 00:43:11.375
-Just a little bit. Clóvis!
-No way!

805
00:43:11.458 --> 00:43:14.083
-Please. just 30 minutes.
-Let go of my arm.

806
00:43:14.166 --> 00:43:15.916
-Let's have some fun!
-Get off me!

807
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.791
-Come with me!
-Let me go now!

808
00:43:21.833 --> 00:43:23.000
Sorry.

809
00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:26.458
Look what you did. girl.

810
00:43:26.541 --> 00:43:29.416
You told me to let you go. so I did.

811
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.250
I just took a shower. now I'm a mess.

812
00:43:32.333 --> 00:43:34.541
Look. I can't believe it. Lohane.

813
00:43:35.083 --> 00:43:36.041
Just look at it.

814
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.333
It was not my fault.

815
00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:45.250
I want a hug.

816
00:43:45.333 --> 00:43:48.291
-No. Clóvis! Don't be resentful. wait!
-Hug me.

817
00:43:48.375 --> 00:43:51.500
You! You're the man who scammed me!

818
00:43:51.583 --> 00:43:52.416
Run!

819
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.125
-She's crazy! Where's my check?
-Come back!

820
00:43:55.208 --> 00:43:57.000
-Where's my check?
-Get them!

821
00:43:57.083 --> 00:43:59.291
Stop those thieves!

822
00:44:00.666 --> 00:44:01.541
Run!

823
00:44:05.375 --> 00:44:09.250
See what you did. you idiot?
You should've listened to me.

824
00:44:09.333 --> 00:44:12.000
Now I won't even be able
to rest in this hotel.

825
00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:13.791
I'm so nervous!

826
00:44:13.875 --> 00:44:16.208
I can't go to jail. Clóvis!

827
00:44:16.291 --> 00:44:20.250
Listen. get our stuff from the room
and meet me at the car.

828
00:44:30.625 --> 00:44:32.125
May I help you?

829
00:44:32.208 --> 00:44:34.208
Hello. good evening. How are you?

830
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:37.250
I would like to check out.

831
00:44:38.125 --> 00:44:39.875
Is there a problem?

832
00:44:39.958 --> 00:44:41.666
The hotel is a shithole.

833
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.833
Actually. this city is a shithole.

834
00:44:43.916 --> 00:44:44.833
The state.

835
00:44:44.916 --> 00:44:46.250
The country.

836
00:44:46.333 --> 00:44:48.416
The planet is a shithole.

837
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.208
If I could.
I'd check out of the Milky Way.

838
00:44:51.875 --> 00:44:54.375
But I can't even die. Where would I go?

839
00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:55.833
What if it's worse?

840
00:44:55.916 --> 00:44:57.750
Hurry up. kid. I have to go.

841
00:44:57.833 --> 00:45:00.000
So. will you cancel the deposit?

842
00:45:00.083 --> 00:45:02.375
Of course not. It's already been done.

843
00:45:02.458 --> 00:45:05.458
You'll get it on Monday.
Just refund the difference.

844
00:45:05.541 --> 00:45:07.583
I can't refund what we don't have.

845
00:45:07.666 --> 00:45:09.375
Listen up. kid.

846
00:45:09.875 --> 00:45:11.541
I'm already all dirty.

847
00:45:11.625 --> 00:45:14.583
Do you want to make it even worse?

848
00:45:14.666 --> 00:45:16.416
-Give my money back.
-No.

849
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.875
Are you trying to scam me?

850
00:45:17.958 --> 00:45:20.416
I'll refund your money on Monday.

851
00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:23.916
I'll be far away from here on Monday.
so help me God.

852
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.208
Not even all the sea here

853
00:45:26.291 --> 00:45:29.000
can wash away all the shit
that was done to me.

854
00:45:29.083 --> 00:45:30.708
Unfortunately. you must wait.

855
00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:32.750
Okay. I'll wait.

856
00:45:33.416 --> 00:45:35.875
But I'll sit so I won't get tired.

857
00:45:35.958 --> 00:45:38.000
No. sir. please.

858
00:45:38.083 --> 00:45:39.083
So nice.

859
00:45:39.166 --> 00:45:41.958
Don't do that. please.
For the love of God!

860
00:45:42.041 --> 00:45:45.291
-No. please.
-I am tired! I'm gonna lie down.

861
00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:48.541
-It's so comfortable. I'm sleepy.
-No. sir.

862
00:45:48.625 --> 00:45:51.166
-So good.
-For God's sake. don't do that!

863
00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:53.583
-Stand up. please!
-Okay.

864
00:45:53.666 --> 00:45:55.333
No problem. I'm sorry.

865
00:45:55.416 --> 00:45:56.500
I just ran into this.

866
00:45:56.583 --> 00:45:57.791
You'll pay for it!

867
00:46:00.375 --> 00:46:03.500
So. give me my money back!

868
00:46:06.166 --> 00:46:07.208
Wow. dude.

869
00:46:07.291 --> 00:46:09.625
We came out on top. Clóvis!

870
00:46:10.166 --> 00:46:13.208
Yesterday I was down. but today I'm rich!

871
00:46:13.291 --> 00:46:14.916
We came out on top?

872
00:46:15.541 --> 00:46:17.916
There's no "we." Who's "we"?

873
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.833
We are different. You want other things.

874
00:46:20.916 --> 00:46:22.541
You just want to have fun.

875
00:46:22.625 --> 00:46:24.833
to party. you know?

876
00:46:24.916 --> 00:46:28.583
Not me. I'm all dirty.
I couldn't even take a shower.

877
00:46:29.416 --> 00:46:30.833
We're different. Lohane.

878
00:46:31.333 --> 00:46:33.708
I wanna be alone. I like it that way.

879
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Like Greta Garbo.

880
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:41.875
I'll buy your trailer in the morning.
and then we're done.

881
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.875
Why are you being so rude?

882
00:46:46.708 --> 00:46:47.833
Let's try to sleep.

883
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:09.625
Nasty.

884
00:47:15.333 --> 00:47:16.708
This is your trailer.

885
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:22.625
No. this is not a trailer.
I wanted a trailer.

886
00:47:22.708 --> 00:47:24.333
You wanted one. past tense.

887
00:47:24.416 --> 00:47:26.625
It's all we have. Don't you like it?

888
00:47:27.833 --> 00:47:30.916
Look. a trailer is ideal
for making burgers.

889
00:47:31.833 --> 00:47:34.041
Where is your Brazilian creativity?

890
00:47:34.125 --> 00:47:35.958
Where are your survival skills?

891
00:47:36.041 --> 00:47:38.333
We know how to reinvent ourselves!

892
00:47:38.416 --> 00:47:41.208
You can use this van
to come up with a deal.

893
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:42.500
The Van Combo!

894
00:47:42.583 --> 00:47:44.875
I am tired of being Brazilian. then!

895
00:47:44.958 --> 00:47:46.375
That's your loss.

896
00:47:46.458 --> 00:47:49.125
because we've made
invaluable contributions.

897
00:47:49.208 --> 00:47:53.125
The airplane. wristwatches.
electronic voting. hair straightening

898
00:47:53.208 --> 00:47:56.708
and the most famous one.
the Brazilian wax.

899
00:47:56.791 --> 00:47:59.125
-The full bikini wax.
-No.

900
00:47:59.208 --> 00:48:04.166
A full bikini wax is awful for peeing
because the pee goes everywhere.

901
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.791
-I don't need all this information.
-You do!

902
00:48:06.875 --> 00:48:10.125
Women suffer in these horrible bathrooms!

903
00:48:10.208 --> 00:48:13.000
We need to work our quadriceps to pee.

904
00:48:13.083 --> 00:48:15.583
and the stream
must be steady and straight.

905
00:48:15.666 --> 00:48:17.583
Okay. I don't wanna know that.

906
00:48:17.666 --> 00:48:18.875
Do we agree on the van?

907
00:48:21.166 --> 00:48:22.916
-Do I have a choice?
-No.

908
00:48:31.833 --> 00:48:33.375
So. this is it. Thank you.

909
00:48:35.041 --> 00:48:36.000
You're welcome.

910
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.666
It was my pleasure.

911
00:48:39.291 --> 00:48:40.416
See you around?

912
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.875
Maybe. Life is unpredictable.

913
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.458
Okay. then.

914
00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:45.750
All right. then.

915
00:48:46.333 --> 00:48:47.250
Great.

916
00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:48.250
Great. then.

917
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:50.500
Goodbye.

918
00:48:51.416 --> 00:48:53.166
Now is goodbye for real.

919
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:56.708
Good luck. Clóvis. Take care.

920
00:48:56.791 --> 00:48:57.791
You too.

921
00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:15.208
<i>I didn't learn to say goodbye</i>

922
00:49:16.666 --> 00:49:20.791
<i>I don't know if I will ever get used to it</i>

923
00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:24.000
<i>Looking right into your eyes</i>

924
00:49:24.083 --> 00:49:26.125
<i>I know it will be engraved in mine</i>

925
00:49:26.208 --> 00:49:29.333
<i>The stare in your eyes</i>

926
00:49:30.208 --> 00:49:33.375
<i>I have nothing to say</i>

927
00:49:35.333 --> 00:49:36.583
What the fuck?

928
00:49:39.458 --> 00:49:41.833
Are you insane? What are you doing?

929
00:49:41.916 --> 00:49:43.250
You gave me a van.

930
00:49:43.333 --> 00:49:46.291
You promised me a trailer.
I want a trailer!

931
00:49:46.375 --> 00:49:47.916
Stop complaining!

932
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.458
This is a piece of shit!

933
00:49:49.541 --> 00:49:52.333
I gave you what I could. Just take it!

934
00:49:52.416 --> 00:49:56.083
You said you'd give me a trailer.
I want my trailer!

935
00:49:56.166 --> 00:49:58.166
-I won't!
-Yes. you will!

936
00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:00.166
-You're stupid!
-No. you are!

937
00:50:16.208 --> 00:50:18.833
Damn it!

938
00:50:19.333 --> 00:50:20.291
What the fuck?

939
00:50:22.291 --> 00:50:24.000
I can't believe it.

940
00:50:25.541 --> 00:50:26.416
Fuck!

941
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:45.166
Change the station. This song sucks.

942
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:46.916
I like it.

943
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.708
I also liked my car.

944
00:50:48.791 --> 00:50:52.041
But I had to leave it behind
with a blown engine.

945
00:50:52.125 --> 00:50:53.625
You are so grumpy.

946
00:50:54.166 --> 00:50:55.083
My God. Clóvis.

947
00:50:55.166 --> 00:50:58.000
Let's celebrate
that our family is together again!

948
00:50:58.083 --> 00:51:00.666
What? I'm only here because I need to be.

949
00:51:01.166 --> 00:51:05.875
You hung on to me like a disease.
a virus. I'll get rid of you soon.

950
00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:10.166
I'm having some technical difficulties.
Can someone hear me?

951
00:51:13.375 --> 00:51:14.333
I love this one!

952
00:51:15.333 --> 00:51:17.916
Man. this song is awesome.

953
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.041
So good.

954
00:51:19.125 --> 00:51:21.541
This is a song for driving. for freedom.

955
00:51:21.625 --> 00:51:23.333
Feel the freedom.

956
00:51:23.416 --> 00:51:25.958
The cops are after me. remember?

957
00:51:26.833 --> 00:51:28.250
You're so pessimistic.

958
00:51:28.333 --> 00:51:29.791
It attracts negativity.

959
00:51:29.875 --> 00:51:32.500
You're too serious. too grumpy.

960
00:51:32.583 --> 00:51:34.458
You need to enjoy life.

961
00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:36.416
You want me to enjoy?

962
00:51:36.916 --> 00:51:38.250
Want me to live?

963
00:51:38.333 --> 00:51:39.958
-That's what you want?
-Yes.

964
00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:42.708
-Do you want freedom? Okay.
-Freedom.

965
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:47.458
Freedom!

966
00:51:48.041 --> 00:51:49.875
Excitement!

967
00:51:51.916 --> 00:51:52.750
There you go.

968
00:51:53.333 --> 00:51:56.458
I felt nothing.
My life didn't change one bit.

969
00:51:56.541 --> 00:51:58.958
You didn't really mean it.

970
00:51:59.041 --> 00:52:01.708
You didn't let yourself
be completely free.

971
00:52:02.458 --> 00:52:03.625
Look at me.

972
00:52:03.708 --> 00:52:06.875
I'm totally lost.
sitting next to a criminal.

973
00:52:07.416 --> 00:52:10.541
but I'm here physically and spiritually.

974
00:52:11.791 --> 00:52:13.458
-You want me to let go?
-Yes.

975
00:52:13.541 --> 00:52:14.791
And live?

976
00:52:14.875 --> 00:52:16.875
All you do is criticize.

977
00:52:16.958 --> 00:52:20.125
It was just some advice.
You don't have to do it.

978
00:52:20.208 --> 00:52:23.791
If freedom is what you want.
freedom is what you'll get.

979
00:52:27.291 --> 00:52:30.208
<i>Tell people I'm here…</i>

980
00:52:30.291 --> 00:52:32.000
Set me free. DJ!

981
00:52:32.083 --> 00:52:35.291
<i>So take risks. kiss. make mistakes</i>

982
00:52:35.375 --> 00:52:37.750
<i>Love doesn't come with a warning sign</i>

983
00:52:37.833 --> 00:52:42.208
<i>Tell people I'm here</i>
<i>We only live once</i>

984
00:52:42.291 --> 00:52:44.666
Lohane!

985
00:52:45.458 --> 00:52:47.625
Lohane! Pay attention!

986
00:53:58.416 --> 00:53:59.375
I'm done!

987
00:53:59.458 --> 00:54:01.708
It's been hard to live like this!

988
00:54:01.791 --> 00:54:02.666
Very hard!

989
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:05.666
After this incarnation.
spare me from coming back.

990
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:08.333
There's nothing left for me to endure!

991
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:09.833
Come on.

992
00:54:12.666 --> 00:54:14.208
I'm sorry. Clóvis.

993
00:54:15.666 --> 00:54:16.500
Fuck!

994
00:54:31.333 --> 00:54:33.166
Clóvis. I'm hungry.

995
00:54:33.708 --> 00:54:34.958
Aren't you?

996
00:54:36.958 --> 00:54:38.208
I'm talking to you.

997
00:54:38.916 --> 00:54:41.625
-Talk to my foot!
-Your foot reeks!

998
00:54:41.708 --> 00:54:42.875
Your past reeks.

999
00:54:43.583 --> 00:54:45.958
-It's the same as yours.
-Absolutely not.

1000
00:54:46.041 --> 00:54:48.375
I grew up. I evolved. I moved on.

1001
00:54:48.458 --> 00:54:51.166
My life went downhill because of you.

1002
00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:53.250
Clóvis. don't lie.

1003
00:54:53.333 --> 00:54:56.250
The cops were after you.
and I saved you. darling.

1004
00:54:56.333 --> 00:54:58.041
I brought joy to your life.

1005
00:54:58.125 --> 00:55:00.833
Turn that off.
I don't want to talk to you.

1006
00:55:00.916 --> 00:55:02.166
Talk to my foot.

1007
00:55:17.291 --> 00:55:19.750
Lohane.

1008
00:55:20.291 --> 00:55:22.291
-What is it?
-A mosquito.

1009
00:55:22.375 --> 00:55:25.208
-Leave it. man.
-I'm serious. I need it.

1010
00:55:25.291 --> 00:55:26.500
-For what?
-Eating.

1011
00:55:26.583 --> 00:55:27.958
-A mosquito?
-Stop!

1012
00:55:28.041 --> 00:55:28.958
Don't move.

1013
00:55:29.041 --> 00:55:30.583
I'm not moving. Clóvis.

1014
00:55:31.208 --> 00:55:33.958
I'm actually numb from starvation.

1015
00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:36.708
My stomach is eating itself.

1016
00:55:36.791 --> 00:55:40.833
If I put any food in my mouth.
it will disintegrate.

1017
00:55:41.458 --> 00:55:42.291
It landed.

1018
00:55:44.625 --> 00:55:46.375
What was that. Clóvis?

1019
00:55:47.083 --> 00:55:48.583
That's a crime.

1020
00:55:49.166 --> 00:55:51.791
That's domestic battery.

1021
00:55:51.875 --> 00:55:57.833
People do say assaults happen
in the family. at home!

1022
00:55:57.916 --> 00:55:59.166
What home. girl?

1023
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:00.875
Is this a home? Since when?

1024
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.041
We've hit rock bottom.

1025
00:56:03.125 --> 00:56:05.083
It's not about the trailer

1026
00:56:05.166 --> 00:56:07.041
or getting rich.

1027
00:56:07.125 --> 00:56:10.041
-No?
-No. it's the law of the jungle.

1028
00:56:10.125 --> 00:56:11.750
It's about survival.

1029
00:56:11.833 --> 00:56:13.500
It's about not starving.

1030
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.083
Where are you going?

1031
00:56:18.166 --> 00:56:19.250
To look for food.

1032
00:56:19.333 --> 00:56:21.875
-And I'll be here. starving?
-I don't know!

1033
00:56:21.958 --> 00:56:25.291
I'm not your guardian.
I won't feed a couch potato.

1034
00:56:25.375 --> 00:56:26.958
I'm no such thing!

1035
00:56:27.041 --> 00:56:30.875
I have a business. Clóvis.
I'm a small business owner.

1036
00:56:30.958 --> 00:56:34.166
Small indeed. microscopic.
No one even knows it exists.

1037
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:37.500
I don't wanna listen to you.
I don't care about you!

1038
00:56:37.583 --> 00:56:40.458
DJ. turn on the music! Hit it!

1039
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.166
<i>People are scared</i>

1040
00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:50.291
<i>after two scammers arrived</i>
<i>in the Lakes Region</i>

1041
00:56:50.375 --> 00:56:52.250
<i>and started committing crimes.</i>

1042
00:56:52.333 --> 00:56:54.916
Clóvis! Come back here. hurry!

1043
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.500
<i>They've already scammed a travel agency.</i>

1044
00:56:57.583 --> 00:57:00.875
<i>a bank and a luxury hotel</i>
<i>in Arraial do Cabo.</i>

1045
00:57:00.958 --> 00:57:02.250
-What is it?
-Listen.

1046
00:57:02.333 --> 00:57:05.791
<i>The city security cameras</i>
<i>caught them in action.</i>

1047
00:57:05.875 --> 00:57:07.583
<i>The police have been informed</i>

1048
00:57:07.666 --> 00:57:10.250
<i>and the footage will help</i>
<i>the investigation.</i>

1049
00:57:12.875 --> 00:57:13.791
Clóvis!

1050
00:57:15.291 --> 00:57:17.250
We went too far.

1051
00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:19.583
We lost control. Clóvis!

1052
00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:22.125
Why didn't we study more?

1053
00:57:22.208 --> 00:57:24.291
I could've been a doctor. a lawyer.

1054
00:57:24.375 --> 00:57:27.666
I could be in a courthouse.
but look at me!

1055
00:57:31.125 --> 00:57:32.458
What did you say?

1056
00:57:37.375 --> 00:57:38.791
I wanted to be a doctor.

1057
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.083
The problem is

1058
00:57:43.666 --> 00:57:46.541
between my current self
and my doctor self.

1059
00:57:46.625 --> 00:57:50.208
there's a medical school
that takes eight years.

1060
00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:53.166
What should help me get closer
to practicing medicine

1061
00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:54.833
is what keeps me away.

1062
00:57:54.916 --> 00:57:57.166
Life is so crazy.

1063
00:57:58.708 --> 00:57:59.708
So crazy.

1064
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.916
I know how we'll get out of here.

1065
00:58:07.541 --> 00:58:09.875
UMBERTO MODIANO AIRPORT

1066
00:58:11.625 --> 00:58:12.875
DEPARTURES

1067
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:17.541
-Emergency!
-It's a transplant. excuse us.

1068
00:58:17.625 --> 00:58:20.125
-It's an emergency.
-We have to board now.

1069
00:58:20.208 --> 00:58:22.916
-I wasn't informed.
-I'm informing you now.

1070
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.416
There are specific logistics
for this procedure.

1071
00:58:28.958 --> 00:58:30.833
Do you know what the world needs?

1072
00:58:30.916 --> 00:58:33.083
A heart! What is in here? A heart!

1073
00:58:33.166 --> 00:58:36.500
A person is dying.
and you're wasting our time!

1074
00:58:36.583 --> 00:58:38.791
The Air Force does that. ma'am.

1075
00:58:38.875 --> 00:58:42.541
It transports politicians.
They don't even have a heart!

1076
00:58:42.625 --> 00:58:46.166
The Air Force sent us.
and you send us back to the Air Force?

1077
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:47.291
What should I do?

1078
00:58:47.375 --> 00:58:49.416
Ask Santa Claus for a sleigh?

1079
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.333
Is that so?

1080
00:58:50.416 --> 00:58:52.958
This is an outrage!
I can't board the plane!

1081
00:58:53.041 --> 00:58:55.666
-An outrage!
-An outrage!

1082
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:58.750
Fine. the flight isn't full.

1083
00:58:58.833 --> 00:59:00.625
-Documents. please.
-Here.

1084
00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:30.958
I can't believe we did it!

1085
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:34.958
Can you speak louder?
Do you want to get arrested now or later?

1086
00:59:35.041 --> 00:59:38.250
-What? I didn't do anything.
-Yes. now you're a saint.

1087
00:59:40.083 --> 00:59:42.000
-I'm going to the restroom.
-Go ahead.

1088
00:59:43.208 --> 00:59:46.708
-Stay here. I don't know this city.
-Fine.

1089
00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:50.583
If you leave me. they'll find me
in ten years with dreadlocks.

1090
00:59:50.666 --> 00:59:52.333
-A hobo.
-Hurry up. girl.

1091
00:59:54.333 --> 00:59:55.416
A vagrant!

1092
00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.583
Just go already!

1093
01:00:09.416 --> 01:00:10.250
Clóvis.

1094
01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:13.416
-You're under arrest.
-Shit.

1095
01:00:14.166 --> 01:00:15.000
Fuck.

1096
01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:20.333
Hurry up. What is taking so long?

1097
01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:24.000
They can't even arrest people efficiently
in this country.

1098
01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:25.333
Come on!

1099
01:00:31.666 --> 01:00:32.500
Clóvis?

1100
01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:48.041
{\an8}CLÓVIS CARDOZO GOMES
ADMITTANCE: 04-14-2017

1101
01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:56.208
<i>In jail. with no money. without Lohane.</i>
<i>and with that crazy bearded guy beside me.</i>

1102
01:00:56.291 --> 01:00:58.208
<i>It would be the end for anyone.</i>

1103
01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:01.458
<i>but a real con artist never gives up.</i>

1104
01:01:01.541 --> 01:01:03.541
You know you're done. right?

1105
01:01:04.875 --> 01:01:07.291
Based on your criminal record.

1106
01:01:07.375 --> 01:01:11.041
you will spend. I don't know.
about 20 years in prison.

1107
01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:13.958
-Let's talk it over.
-I won't talk to you.

1108
01:01:14.041 --> 01:01:15.541
Nunes. just take him.

1109
01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:17.750
If I help you. will you help me?

1110
01:01:17.833 --> 01:01:19.750
Help me? You can't even help yourself.

1111
01:01:19.833 --> 01:01:23.625
Tell me. Do you think
this guy has something to offer me?

1112
01:01:23.708 --> 01:01:24.583
Scumbag.

1113
01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:28.416
<i>Two hundred years ago</i>.

1114
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:32.083
<i>an ensign got outraged</i>
<i>by the injustices of the Portuguese Crown</i>

1115
01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:34.208
<i>and fought for our freedom.</i>

1116
01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:36.833
<i>But his own accomplices turned him in.</i>

1117
01:01:36.916 --> 01:01:41.125
<i>He was hanged. quartered.</i>
<i>and his remains were publicly displayed.</i>

1118
01:01:41.708 --> 01:01:44.708
<i>The traitors were acquitted by the queen.</i>

1119
01:01:44.791 --> 01:01:47.583
<i>The title has gained</i>
<i>several synonyms since:</i>

1120
01:01:47.666 --> 01:01:51.041
<i>snitch. tattletale. narc.</i>
<i>whistle-blower. rat.</i>

1121
01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:53.500
<i>Recently. it received a much cooler one:</i>

1122
01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:56.291
Plea bargaining.

1123
01:01:58.708 --> 01:02:00.083
Let me talk to him.

1124
01:02:01.583 --> 01:02:03.333
It's trending.

1125
01:02:03.416 --> 01:02:05.000
Everybody's doing it.

1126
01:02:05.541 --> 01:02:07.791
I can't miss out on this.

1127
01:02:07.875 --> 01:02:10.083
Neither can you. right?

1128
01:02:12.166 --> 01:02:13.000
Spit it out.

1129
01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:15.500
I'll do it only if I can get a pardon.

1130
01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:18.333
What are you talking about?

1131
01:02:18.416 --> 01:02:19.958
A Federal Senator.

1132
01:02:21.583 --> 01:02:22.500
Go on.

1133
01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:26.125
There's a money-laundering scheme
involving fake works of art.

1134
01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:29.458
I know about it because I'm involved.
the counterfeiter.

1135
01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:32.500
Nice to meet you.
I'm the artist. actually.

1136
01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:36.375
Who is always undermined.
unappreciated. who's paid less…

1137
01:02:36.458 --> 01:02:38.250
But let's not talk about that.

1138
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:40.833
I am willing to cooperate.

1139
01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:45.166
and you can catch
not only a small fish like myself.

1140
01:02:46.208 --> 01:02:47.583
but a shark.

1141
01:02:48.541 --> 01:02:51.000
A shark! That's right.

1142
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.000
-Nunes!
-What?

1143
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.416
Have you ever eaten a shark?

1144
01:03:01.833 --> 01:03:05.291
Listen. you deadbeat.
the feds have joined the case.

1145
01:03:06.166 --> 01:03:07.000
You see?

1146
01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:10.541
Do you think this ankle bracelet
is just an accessory?

1147
01:03:11.125 --> 01:03:13.375
You are being monitored 24/7.

1148
01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:17.000
I promised to deliver
the Senator's head on a platter.

1149
01:03:17.083 --> 01:03:19.625
so don't think about screwing me over.

1150
01:03:19.708 --> 01:03:22.791
Relax. I won't do anything
behind your back.

1151
01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:25.166
One more thing.

1152
01:03:26.875 --> 01:03:29.083
If something goes wrong. you're done.

1153
01:03:29.166 --> 01:03:31.541
And not for 20 years. you'll be a lifer.

1154
01:03:32.458 --> 01:03:35.500
Everything will work out
just fine. deputy.

1155
01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:37.916
Think about your promotion.

1156
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.833
Hey. take this.

1157
01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:44.000
I have a copy. One week.

1158
01:03:44.083 --> 01:03:45.958
That's all you got. One week.

1159
01:03:50.166 --> 01:03:52.166
Lohane? Where are you?

1160
01:04:00.375 --> 01:04:03.166
The check scam
is working here in São Paulo.

1161
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:05.791
-I almost fell for it.
-I created a monster.

1162
01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:08.083
No. you didn't create a monster.

1163
01:04:08.166 --> 01:04:11.958
you gave birth to a monster
and left it in the gutter.

1164
01:04:12.041 --> 01:04:14.208
I told you not to leave me.

1165
01:04:14.291 --> 01:04:17.166
Luckily. I'm very charming.

1166
01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:18.625
Hi there!

1167
01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:20.208
Will you let me talk?

1168
01:04:20.333 --> 01:04:22.500
Clóvis. I'm not gonna be mad at you

1169
01:04:22.583 --> 01:04:25.458
only because I left
with nothing but my clothes.

1170
01:04:25.541 --> 01:04:28.375
and now I'm here. looking stunning.

1171
01:04:28.458 --> 01:04:30.916
in one of the biggest cities. São Paulo.

1172
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.583
and I'm on the lookout
for better opportunities…

1173
01:04:35.791 --> 01:04:37.375
if you know what I mean.

1174
01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:38.791
Lohane. where are you?

1175
01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:39.958
<i>Where am I?</i>

1176
01:04:40.041 --> 01:04:42.541
I'm on Oscar.

1177
01:04:43.125 --> 01:04:44.666
Oscar Freire.

1178
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:48.500
You were not delusional.
you're right. We're siblings.

1179
01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:50.083
Siblings fight. you know?

1180
01:04:50.166 --> 01:04:54.958
They get angry. argue.
say they won't speak to each other again.

1181
01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:57.750
-Thirty minutes later. it's all fine.
-Thirty?

1182
01:04:58.416 --> 01:05:01.458
I spent a hell of a night alone
in São Paulo.

1183
01:05:02.083 --> 01:05:04.291
-I saw terrible things.
-Listen.

1184
01:05:04.375 --> 01:05:08.208
I had to sort some things out
and find a place for us to stay.

1185
01:05:08.291 --> 01:05:12.291
And now I'm here to take you
to this apartment I got.

1186
01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:15.208
-You already did that?
-I have connections.

1187
01:05:15.291 --> 01:05:18.166
Now let's go.
because we really are siblings.

1188
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:21.250
We are family.
and I have a proposition for you.

1189
01:05:21.333 --> 01:05:23.041
Proposition?

1190
01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:25.208
Our last scam together.

1191
01:05:25.291 --> 01:05:26.125
A big one.

1192
01:05:27.333 --> 01:05:29.000
I knew it. Clóvis.

1193
01:05:29.083 --> 01:05:34.041
When you talked about siblings and family.
I knew you were up to something.

1194
01:05:34.625 --> 01:05:36.208
Unfortunately. I can't.

1195
01:05:36.291 --> 01:05:39.833
I have an event
that cannot be postponed. my life!

1196
01:05:39.916 --> 01:05:41.583
I can't miss it.

1197
01:05:41.666 --> 01:05:46.458
If I survived 24 hours here without you.
I can survive the entire month.

1198
01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:47.958
It's not about survival.

1199
01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:51.708
I'm talking about something big.
A lot of money.

1200
01:05:52.666 --> 01:05:54.583
Impossible. How much?

1201
01:05:55.583 --> 01:05:58.666
You know that I've always liked to draw.

1202
01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.875
<i>Eventually I became a really good painter.</i>

1203
01:06:05.791 --> 01:06:09.333
<i>So good that</i>
<i>I counterfeited famous paintings.</i>

1204
01:06:10.125 --> 01:06:14.000
<i>I got in touch with a Senator</i>
<i>who liked to buy these paintings.</i>

1205
01:06:14.583 --> 01:06:18.375
<i>Then I sold him a fake painting</i>
<i>for really good money.</i>

1206
01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:22.416
<i>But that man broke into my apartment.</i>
<i>got all his money back.</i>

1207
01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.416
<i>and stole the money I made</i>
<i>selling the Christ.</i>

1208
01:06:26.375 --> 01:06:30.750
<i>That's why I was running away</i>
<i>the day you showed up and I ran over you.</i>

1209
01:06:32.583 --> 01:06:35.875
An art counterfeiter?

1210
01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:36.875
Yeah.

1211
01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:37.791
My God.

1212
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.291
You never cease to amaze me.

1213
01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:43.750
We just need to sell him a new painting.

1214
01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:44.916
And he pays well.

1215
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.458
I'll do everything perfectly.
as I always do.

1216
01:06:48.541 --> 01:06:50.833
But he knows me.
he already screwed me over.

1217
01:06:50.916 --> 01:06:52.875
so I need a new guy to talk to him.

1218
01:06:52.958 --> 01:06:56.041
Or a new girl. You. dear.

1219
01:06:56.125 --> 01:06:58.208
No. No way.

1220
01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:03.791
Listen. you want to do business
with the big shot who screwed you over?

1221
01:07:04.375 --> 01:07:07.041
What do you want me to do.
jump off a bridge?

1222
01:07:07.125 --> 01:07:09.291
Gargle with the Tietê River's water?
No way!

1223
01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:11.958
-What else do you want?
-It'll work this time.

1224
01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:15.125
You just need to sell the painting
and get the money.

1225
01:07:15.625 --> 01:07:17.000
Trust me on this.

1226
01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:20.041
It's the last scam. I promise.

1227
01:07:20.125 --> 01:07:21.833
We'll have a better life.

1228
01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:23.458
Trust me.

1229
01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:26.916
Will I get half of the money?

1230
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.166
Of course!

1231
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:31.500
You'll be able to buy
a brand-new trailer and much more.

1232
01:07:31.583 --> 01:07:36.166
No. you'll buy it with your share.
as promised.

1233
01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:40.333
You'll give me my share.
and then you'll buy a trailer with yours.

1234
01:07:41.125 --> 01:07:42.291
Such a smart-ass.

1235
01:07:42.375 --> 01:07:44.375
I had a good teacher.

1236
01:07:45.291 --> 01:07:46.291
Fine.

1237
01:07:48.708 --> 01:07:49.708
It's a deal.

1238
01:07:49.791 --> 01:07:50.916
<i>Abaporu.</i>

1239
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.708
One of the most important paintings
in the history of art.

1240
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:57.833
It was bought at an auction
for $2.5 million.

1241
01:07:57.916 --> 01:08:00.958
-More than six million reais.
-Too expensive.

1242
01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:03.791
-It's worth $30 million today.
-Damn! Thirty?

1243
01:08:03.875 --> 01:08:06.583
And my burgers are three bucks a pop.

1244
01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.833
It was painted by Tarsila do Amaral.

1245
01:08:08.916 --> 01:08:10.250
Tarsila? Who is she?

1246
01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:12.291
Tarsila was modern.

1247
01:08:12.375 --> 01:08:15.166
I think of myself as modern. too. Clóvis.

1248
01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:19.250
-She had a clean technique.
-I mastered that technique.

1249
01:08:19.333 --> 01:08:21.458
My bank account is all cleaned up.

1250
01:08:21.541 --> 01:08:24.541
Look. write down
she had a Brazilwood phase.

1251
01:08:24.625 --> 01:08:26.416
So lucky.

1252
01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.541
I've never gotten out of that phase.

1253
01:08:29.625 --> 01:08:34.166
I've been in that phase for ages.
I've never seen foreign wood.

1254
01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:35.416
Listen up.

1255
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.541
You must be convincing.

1256
01:08:37.625 --> 01:08:38.583
-Okay.
-Okay?

1257
01:08:38.666 --> 01:08:40.708
I'll paint a Portinari now.

1258
01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:43.083
Who?

1259
01:08:43.958 --> 01:08:45.083
Girl…

1260
01:08:47.833 --> 01:08:51.291
Impressionism. expressionism.
cubism. and surrealism. go!

1261
01:08:51.375 --> 01:08:55.375
Impressionists paint
their impression of reality. It's boring.

1262
01:08:55.458 --> 01:08:58.791
Expressionists express
their suffering. their emotions.

1263
01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:02.416
They get drunk.
and their paintings are wonky. I like it.

1264
01:09:12.458 --> 01:09:14.208
What's wrong. Clóvis?

1265
01:09:14.291 --> 01:09:16.791
-Creative crisis.
-Economic crisis. you mean.

1266
01:09:16.875 --> 01:09:20.666
A person can't have a creative crisis
without a dime.

1267
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:22.041
Paint anything!

1268
01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:25.708
I know. Want me to be your muse?

1269
01:09:27.666 --> 01:09:29.708
Cheap erotica? Are you insane?

1270
01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:32.541
My crisis will last forever.
Go study. Lohane.

1271
01:09:43.375 --> 01:09:46.416
Picasso: Spanish. cubist. millionaire.

1272
01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:49.833
Me: Brazilian. con artist. fucked up.

1273
01:09:55.708 --> 01:09:57.541
Amazing!

1274
01:09:59.166 --> 01:10:00.000
Horrible.

1275
01:10:03.916 --> 01:10:05.083
I'm not ready.

1276
01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:07.541
I'm mixing everything up. I'm desperate.

1277
01:10:07.625 --> 01:10:09.125
Just say what I told you.

1278
01:10:09.208 --> 01:10:13.333
That he's interested in pieces
of artistic and financial value.

1279
01:10:13.416 --> 01:10:15.416
and you have something he'll like.

1280
01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.250
I don't know what it is.

1281
01:10:17.333 --> 01:10:19.625
I've lied so much.
and now I'm being honest?

1282
01:10:19.708 --> 01:10:21.166
I feel sick.

1283
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Get me some water.

1284
01:10:25.875 --> 01:10:27.916
Taste is good. but money is money.

1285
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.833
You might not like a Picasso
in your living room.

1286
01:10:30.916 --> 01:10:33.750
but you'll love a Picasso
in your bank account.

1287
01:10:34.916 --> 01:10:37.291
Yes. I'll send it. I'll send it now.

1288
01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:38.625
Just a minute.

1289
01:10:39.666 --> 01:10:40.541
Done.

1290
01:10:41.125 --> 01:10:42.375
But be discreet.

1291
01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:45.250
Pretend you received some nudes.

1292
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.250
Which is also true

1293
01:10:47.333 --> 01:10:50.291
because the artist strips for the art.

1294
01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:55.625
I told you. It's amazing.

1295
01:10:55.708 --> 01:10:57.458
-Thirty thousand?
-A hundred.

1296
01:10:57.541 --> 01:11:00.583
No. I'm sorry. That's one installment.

1297
01:11:00.666 --> 01:11:03.625
We sell it for 100.
but I'll sell it to you for 90.

1298
01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:06.708
-Or no deal. Stand your ground.
-Or no deal.

1299
01:11:06.791 --> 01:11:08.083
Stand your ground.

1300
01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:12.291
So?

1301
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:16.833
No deal.

1302
01:11:17.583 --> 01:11:18.708
Motherfucker.

1303
01:11:20.708 --> 01:11:24.291
I got rejected for something
I didn't even want. Clóvis.

1304
01:11:24.375 --> 01:11:26.875
It's all your fault. What now?

1305
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
"Fifty grand and it's a deal."

1306
01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:38.375
Deal.

1307
01:11:53.083 --> 01:11:54.541
Can you hear me. Clóvis?

1308
01:11:54.625 --> 01:11:55.625
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

1309
01:11:55.708 --> 01:11:58.958
<i>Act naturally.</i>
<i>like you're an honest person.</i>

1310
01:11:59.041 --> 01:12:01.500
I don't know how. I was born dishonest.

1311
01:12:01.583 --> 01:12:04.625
Don't answer me!
They'll think you're crazy.

1312
01:12:05.208 --> 01:12:07.125
They already do.

1313
01:12:07.208 --> 01:12:10.291
I'm a medium. I'm here for your family.

1314
01:12:10.375 --> 01:12:14.458
The deceased just checked into Heaven.
Everything is fine.

1315
01:12:14.541 --> 01:12:16.166
Your energy is murky.

1316
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:17.666
I'll pray for you.

1317
01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:19.125
God damn it!

1318
01:12:20.083 --> 01:12:21.583
Are you dead or alive?

1319
01:12:21.666 --> 01:12:23.500
The man coming. is he alive?

1320
01:12:23.583 --> 01:12:24.875
That's Fortunato.

1321
01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:28.208
-Jesus!
-Fortunato. Nice to meet you.

1322
01:12:28.291 --> 01:12:31.208
Don't do that.
we can't tell if you're alive.

1323
01:12:31.291 --> 01:12:32.333
You're like a ghost.

1324
01:12:32.416 --> 01:12:36.333
São Paulo was built
on top of an indigenous cemetery.

1325
01:12:36.416 --> 01:12:39.791
São Paulo is a double-decker cemetery.

1326
01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:41.916
The energy here is so murky.

1327
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.583
I've got goosebumps. What the hell?

1328
01:12:44.666 --> 01:12:46.125
I'm here for the painting.

1329
01:12:46.208 --> 01:12:49.291
About that. I'm not the counterfeiter.

1330
01:12:49.375 --> 01:12:53.583
I'm a medium.
and I use spirituality to paint.

1331
01:12:53.666 --> 01:12:56.541
I don't use my hands.
It's a unique technique.

1332
01:12:56.625 --> 01:12:59.333
I paint with my feet. and I go like…

1333
01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:02.250
You should see it.

1334
01:13:02.333 --> 01:13:04.708
I don't care if you paint them or not.

1335
01:13:04.791 --> 01:13:07.375
I'm just here for the painting.
Where is it?

1336
01:13:07.458 --> 01:13:09.875
<i>-What was that. Lohane?</i>
-What?

1337
01:13:09.958 --> 01:13:11.083
-What?
-Yes.

1338
01:13:11.166 --> 01:13:13.791
Yes!

1339
01:13:13.875 --> 01:13:16.583
Too many people talking at the same time.

1340
01:13:16.666 --> 01:13:17.541
I apologize.

1341
01:13:17.625 --> 01:13:20.166
I have a great connection.
They're so close.

1342
01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:25.333
There are great artists buried here. okay?
They're talking to me.

1343
01:13:25.416 --> 01:13:29.708
They're very happy with our deal.
It's the deal of a lifetime. or death.

1344
01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:31.958
Just kidding.

1345
01:13:34.041 --> 01:13:36.083
Say there's something in your eye.

1346
01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:39.500
-What's going on here?
-Something got in my eyes.

1347
01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:42.250
My eyes! There's something in them.

1348
01:13:42.333 --> 01:13:46.500
-Why is that homeless man looking at us?
-What? Homeless man?

1349
01:13:46.583 --> 01:13:48.416
That one over there?

1350
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.666
I didn't see him. He blended in.

1351
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:53.000
Cemeteries have beggars.

1352
01:13:53.083 --> 01:13:54.833
It's the voodoo offerings.

1353
01:13:54.916 --> 01:13:57.791
They eat the offerings
since they have no food.

1354
01:13:57.875 --> 01:14:00.083
It's food for the saints. It's great.

1355
01:14:00.166 --> 01:14:03.208
Gumbo. stew. It's heavenly. delicious.

1356
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:05.166
-Sorry.
-I'll ask again.

1357
01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:06.833
Do you know that homeless man?

1358
01:14:06.916 --> 01:14:09.333
How would I know him?

1359
01:14:09.416 --> 01:14:12.791
That's absurd!
Nobody knows a homeless man.

1360
01:14:12.875 --> 01:14:16.333
Who calls them up
and invites them to go have a drink?

1361
01:14:16.416 --> 01:14:19.541
No such thing.
Let's cut to the chase. Your Portinari.

1362
01:14:31.666 --> 01:14:32.958
<i>I told you it would work.</i>

1363
01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:35.708
We're a team. We're a duo!

1364
01:14:35.791 --> 01:14:37.541
Yes. we are a duo!

1365
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:45.250
Hey. let's sing a duet.
No singing by ourselves.

1366
01:14:45.333 --> 01:14:47.458
You said we're a duo. so let's sing.

1367
01:14:47.541 --> 01:14:48.541
Which duo are we?

1368
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:51.500
Sandy & Junior. obviously.
They're siblings. too.

1369
01:14:51.583 --> 01:14:52.750
I'm Sandy. then!

1370
01:14:54.416 --> 01:14:55.291
I said it first.

1371
01:14:55.375 --> 01:14:58.875
Of course not!
I'm Sandy. I'm a girl. You're Junior.

1372
01:14:58.958 --> 01:15:00.458
I don't wanna be Junior.

1373
01:15:00.541 --> 01:15:03.041
I don't have to. I don't relate with him.

1374
01:15:03.125 --> 01:15:05.041
I'm more like Sandy. you know?

1375
01:15:05.125 --> 01:15:07.166
I'll be Sandy. sorry.

1376
01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:10.916
It'll be Sandy and Sandy.
I won't be Junior 'cause you're Sandy.

1377
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.083
All right. Sandy and Sandy.

1378
01:15:13.166 --> 01:15:15.708
We'll tell society
that we don't follow rules.

1379
01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:19.500
-We can do whatever we want.
-Great. let's get a drink. Sandy.

1380
01:15:28.166 --> 01:15:32.125
<i>I've decided to lay my cards on the table</i>

1381
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:36.625
<i>I decided to go after you</i>

1382
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:40.875
<i>And show that I am crazy</i>

1383
01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:44.000
<i>For you</i>

1384
01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.250
<i>You better think</i>

1385
01:15:48.041 --> 01:15:50.041
<i>Of what you will say to me</i>

1386
01:15:51.666 --> 01:15:54.833
<i>I want someone to love me</i>

1387
01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:56.250
<i>You better think</i>

1388
01:15:57.125 --> 01:15:59.416
<i>Of what you will do</i>

1389
01:16:00.625 --> 01:16:03.833
<i>So that you won't hurt me</i>

1390
01:16:03.916 --> 01:16:05.958
<i>I will always love you</i>

1391
01:16:06.041 --> 01:16:09.375
<i>I'm stuck on you</i>
<i>And it's for real</i>

1392
01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:13.250
<i>I'm stuck on you</i>
<i>And it's for real</i>

1393
01:16:15.625 --> 01:16:18.000
<i>I'm stuck on you</i>
<i>And it's for real</i>

1394
01:16:19.666 --> 01:16:21.791
<i>Come to me</i>

1395
01:16:21.875 --> 01:16:24.958
<i>Let's be happy</i>

1396
01:17:06.333 --> 01:17:07.333
Clóvis?

1397
01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:44.291
Good afternoon.

1398
01:17:44.875 --> 01:17:50.083
Welcome to this beautiful event.
You make it beautiful.

1399
01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:54.791
I see we have distinguished people here
this afternoon.

1400
01:17:54.875 --> 01:17:58.333
but the star of the event

1401
01:17:58.416 --> 01:18:02.250
is a very rare piece painted by Portinari.

1402
01:18:02.333 --> 01:18:05.208
Let's take a look at it. Please.

1403
01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:15.208
What a beautiful painting.
I've got goosebumps.

1404
01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:18.750
It's been a while
since I've seen a Portinari so up close.

1405
01:18:20.333 --> 01:18:23.208
The owner of this rare piece of art

1406
01:18:23.291 --> 01:18:26.416
is an eminent personality in Brazil.

1407
01:18:27.166 --> 01:18:31.291
Senator Afonso Narcos.
who is here with us today.

1408
01:18:31.375 --> 01:18:33.000
Please. Senator. stand up.

1409
01:18:33.583 --> 01:18:35.458
Nice suit. Senator.

1410
01:18:35.958 --> 01:18:38.416
Thank you. You may sit down.

1411
01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:43.041
The initial bid for our masterpiece.

1412
01:18:43.125 --> 01:18:44.833
stipulated by our appraisers.

1413
01:18:44.916 --> 01:18:46.666
is 800.000 reais.

1414
01:18:47.291 --> 01:18:48.625
Anyone?

1415
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.166
A million! Wonderful!

1416
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:53.750
A million! Who bids more?

1417
01:18:54.666 --> 01:18:58.000
We have an enthusiast
over there. 1.2 million.

1418
01:18:58.083 --> 01:18:59.291
Who bids more?

1419
01:18:59.375 --> 01:19:01.583
1.4 million.

1420
01:19:01.666 --> 01:19:04.166
Get ready. Clóvis. It's time.

1421
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:06.291
-Fill my glass.
-Ask another waiter.

1422
01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:08.708
Now. Clóvis.

1423
01:19:11.791 --> 01:19:12.625
Lohane. no!

1424
01:19:13.208 --> 01:19:14.458
What are you doing here?

1425
01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:16.875
-What are you doing here?
<i>-Going once…</i>

1426
01:19:16.958 --> 01:19:18.375
How did you get here?

1427
01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:19.875
I followed you.

1428
01:19:19.958 --> 01:19:23.583
Go away. Trust me. it's for the best.

1429
01:19:25.958 --> 01:19:27.791
Trust you. Clóvis?

1430
01:19:29.041 --> 01:19:30.250
What are you hiding?

1431
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:33.958
I'm hiding you from the cops. Go away.

1432
01:19:34.625 --> 01:19:35.541
Excuse me.

1433
01:19:36.125 --> 01:19:39.708
Who bids more? 2.3 million over there.

1434
01:19:39.791 --> 01:19:40.958
Anyone?

1435
01:19:42.166 --> 01:19:45.083
2.6 million reais.

1436
01:19:45.166 --> 01:19:47.375
Anyone? 2.8 million.

1437
01:19:47.458 --> 01:19:49.250
It's a very close race.

1438
01:19:49.333 --> 01:19:50.500
Who bids more?

1439
01:19:50.583 --> 01:19:52.500
Three million over here!

1440
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
The guy who bought it from me
is buying it again?

1441
01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:57.333
What are you up to?

1442
01:19:57.416 --> 01:20:02.125
Sold to the gentleman here.
Congratulations.

1443
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.666
Let's hear it for him.

1444
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:07.041
I can't explain now. Go away!

1445
01:20:07.125 --> 01:20:09.458
Not until you explain everything.

1446
01:20:09.541 --> 01:20:11.375
You're getting in my way. Go!

1447
01:20:11.958 --> 01:20:13.875
Stop!

1448
01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:15.375
Just for a minute.

1449
01:20:15.458 --> 01:20:17.166
I have something for you.

1450
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:20.333
Why is a waiter interrupting the auction?

1451
01:20:20.416 --> 01:20:23.250
And some people say
people don't appreciate art.

1452
01:20:23.333 --> 01:20:27.916
Do you plan on bidding?
Did you sign up for the event?

1453
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.500
I'm not here for that.

1454
01:20:29.583 --> 01:20:31.375
I'm here to make an offer.

1455
01:20:31.458 --> 01:20:35.958
If this painting is worth three million.
then tell me something.

1456
01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:39.541
How much is this one worth?

1457
01:20:40.916 --> 01:20:43.291
What? A fake replica?

1458
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.041
Which one? Mine or the Senator's?

1459
01:20:47.125 --> 01:20:48.708
Or both?

1460
01:20:48.791 --> 01:20:50.208
Which one is faker?

1461
01:20:51.166 --> 01:20:54.791
-Arrest him. deputy.
-He is insane! Security!

1462
01:20:54.875 --> 01:20:58.000
Attention. everyone. The auction is over!

1463
01:20:59.916 --> 01:21:00.958
What?

1464
01:21:01.041 --> 01:21:02.000
What's going on?

1465
01:21:02.083 --> 01:21:04.875
Please leave
in a calm and organized manner.

1466
01:21:04.958 --> 01:21:06.583
I'll get your statements.

1467
01:21:07.125 --> 01:21:09.333
Not you. Senator. Wait a minute.

1468
01:21:09.416 --> 01:21:11.083
Wait a minute. yeah.

1469
01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:12.500
Stop right there.

1470
01:21:12.583 --> 01:21:14.833
Senator. I'm the police chief.

1471
01:21:15.333 --> 01:21:16.791
I apologize. sir.

1472
01:21:17.458 --> 01:21:21.208
but I've received a tip
about a money laundering scheme

1473
01:21:21.291 --> 01:21:23.000
involving your painting.

1474
01:21:23.083 --> 01:21:24.833
Not that it means you're involved.

1475
01:21:24.916 --> 01:21:28.000
but there is evidence
that this painting is fake.

1476
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:32.125
Deputy. I am a federal senator.

1477
01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:34.125
I have jurisdiction privileges.

1478
01:21:34.208 --> 01:21:35.708
-Really?
-Don't worry.

1479
01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:39.208
I will do everything I can
to clarify this situation.

1480
01:21:40.083 --> 01:21:41.250
Allow me.

1481
01:21:41.333 --> 01:21:43.708
He paid 50 thousand for the painting.

1482
01:21:43.791 --> 01:21:46.583
so he would get
three million for it legally.

1483
01:21:46.666 --> 01:21:51.083
Dirty money of unknown provenance
would get into his account legally.

1484
01:21:51.166 --> 01:21:55.875
Deputy. please.
you can speak to my lawyers.

1485
01:21:56.583 --> 01:21:59.333
-I trust the justice system.
-You won't arrest him?

1486
01:21:59.416 --> 01:22:01.541
-Arrest him! I'll do it. then.
-No!

1487
01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:04.291
-You're hurting me!
-I'll make a citizen's arrest!

1488
01:22:04.375 --> 01:22:06.083
-Arrest him. dude!
-Chief.

1489
01:22:06.166 --> 01:22:07.666
What's going on. Clóvis?

1490
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:08.958
No. not her.

1491
01:22:09.041 --> 01:22:11.208
The Senator gets to walk. but she doesn't?

1492
01:22:11.291 --> 01:22:12.875
It is what it is.

1493
01:22:12.958 --> 01:22:17.208
You promised a money-laundering scheme
with fake paintings and a senator.

1494
01:22:17.291 --> 01:22:19.375
Senators are untouchable. Who's left?

1495
01:22:19.458 --> 01:22:21.416
The counterfeiter and the receiver.

1496
01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:25.291
Don't you know
that the weakest always goes to the wall?

1497
01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:29.500
-That wasn't the deal!
-I made a deal with you.

1498
01:22:29.583 --> 01:22:31.666
You brought her into it.

1499
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:34.458
If you had told me the truth.
I would've helped.

1500
01:22:34.541 --> 01:22:36.375
I can't go back empty-handed.

1501
01:22:36.458 --> 01:22:39.708
I need to think about my promotion.

1502
01:22:39.791 --> 01:22:40.791
Right?

1503
01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:43.125
Take her.

1504
01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:45.250
She's a decent person.

1505
01:22:45.333 --> 01:22:47.041
She works. She has a trailer.

1506
01:22:47.125 --> 01:22:47.958
I do.

1507
01:22:48.041 --> 01:22:50.708
She is a fighter. I made her do it.

1508
01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:53.958
You said it was all set and good to go.

1509
01:22:54.041 --> 01:22:56.166
I told you I'm a liability.

1510
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.166
You can use it all against me.
but let her go.

1511
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:07.750
Take me away from society and mankind…

1512
01:23:09.875 --> 01:23:12.208
but don't take the only person I love.

1513
01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:20.125
What is this. a soap opera? What are you?

1514
01:23:21.125 --> 01:23:22.541
-Siblings.
-Siblings.

1515
01:23:47.666 --> 01:23:52.375
{\an8}18 MONTHS LATER

1516
01:23:56.916 --> 01:23:59.166
<i>I served my time. all right?</i>

1517
01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:01.208
<i>The court. on the other hand.</i>

1518
01:24:01.291 --> 01:24:05.666
<i>sentenced me to eight years in prison.</i>
<i>but gradually reduced my sentence.</i>

1519
01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:10.791
<i>It was initially reduced for helping</i>
<i>to solve the crime I committed myself.</i>

1520
01:24:10.875 --> 01:24:12.875
<i>Then. it was reduced even more.</i>

1521
01:24:12.958 --> 01:24:15.041
<i>There were so many appeals.</i>

1522
01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:18.583
<i>that I think I was released</i>
<i>with some credits with the law.</i>

1523
01:24:19.375 --> 01:24:22.000
<i>And if you think my sentence was short.</i>

1524
01:24:22.083 --> 01:24:24.125
<i>even with all the evidence.</i>

1525
01:24:24.208 --> 01:24:26.416
<i>the Senator got away with everything.</i>

1526
01:24:34.833 --> 01:24:36.250
I can't believe it!

1527
01:24:41.375 --> 01:24:44.083
GET THE GRIFT

1528
01:24:53.166 --> 01:24:54.041
Here you go.

1529
01:24:54.125 --> 01:24:58.125
The Double Scam comes with two burgers.
cheese. lettuce and tomato.

1530
01:24:58.208 --> 01:25:02.333
The Jailbird comes with a chicken patty
and our special sauce.

1531
01:25:02.416 --> 01:25:04.708
The Vegan Fraud tastes like meat.

1532
01:25:04.791 --> 01:25:07.083
but it's eggplant with barbecue sauce.

1533
01:25:07.166 --> 01:25:09.833
And the Crooks' Salad is made with tofu.

1534
01:25:09.916 --> 01:25:11.666
-I don't like it.
-I do.

1535
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:12.916
-Really?
-Sure.

1536
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.291
-Make that two.
-Two?

1537
01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.791
Two Crooks' Salads. Lohane!

1538
01:25:16.875 --> 01:25:18.291
Coming right up!

1539
01:25:23.625 --> 01:25:26.166
Now this is a good napkin! It's great!

1540
01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:29.958
I'm proud to serve
good products to my clients.

1541
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:32.166
Here we have barbecue and mayo.

1542
01:25:32.250 --> 01:25:34.125
Real mayo. It's to die for.

1543
01:25:34.208 --> 01:25:35.375
-Enjoy!
-Thank you.

1544
01:25:35.458 --> 01:25:38.041
Crooks' Salad never made anybody sick.

1545
01:25:38.125 --> 01:25:40.166
Some things are way worse.

1546
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:42.250
Don't be lazy. Clóvis!

1547
01:25:42.333 --> 01:25:43.833
Get back to work. honey!

1548
01:25:44.541 --> 01:25:47.083
-We gotta pay the bills.
-But I am working!

1549
01:25:47.166 --> 01:25:49.458
Can't you see that? I am working.

1550
01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:53.458
Would you like anything else?
See. I'm working.

1551
01:25:54.833 --> 01:25:56.666
Go make your sandwiches.

1552
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:08.041
{\an8}Write down that she had
a Brazilwood phase.

1553
01:26:15.541 --> 01:26:17.000
{\an8}Unbelievable.

1554
01:26:17.083 --> 01:26:21.000
{\an8}Impressionists paint
