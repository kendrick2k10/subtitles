00:00:56.724 --> 00:00:59.360
- You're gonna
miss this. Juanito.

4
00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:00.694
- I know.

5
00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:01.862
- I am having lots
of second thoughts.

6
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.697
- Nah. you're doing the
right thing. though.

7
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:04.532
- I hope so.

8
00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:05.866
- Of course you are. man.

9
00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.068
- I know. but
working at a desk?

10
00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:09.203
I mean...

11
00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:10.538
- So you guys pick out

12
00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.206
a name yet. or-
- You're wasting your time.

13
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.207
It's not gonna be Tony.

14
00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:14.408
- Come on. man!

15
00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:16.744
I mean. Tony. that
is a good-ass name.

16
00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:18.078
I mean. not only you got.

17
00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:19.547
you got Uncle Tony here.

18
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.550
you also got Sir
Anthony Hopkins.

19
00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:23.551
- Hannibal Lecter?

20
00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:24.552
- Shit. yeah!

21
00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:25.719
- Yeah. I don't think so.

22
00:01:25.753 --> 00:01:26.920
- Well. I mean.
you know he's not

23
00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:28.055
actually Hannibal.
though. right?

24
00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.223
- I mean. ask anyone.

25
00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:30.724
Say. "Hey. y'all know
Anthony Hopkins?".

26
00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:33.227
and it'll be like. "Oh.
the dude who eats people?"

27
00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:34.395
Shit!

28
00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.564
- All right. well. what
about Marc Anthony?

29
00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:37.398
- Idiot.

30
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:39.267
Divorced J-Lo. bad move.

31
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.569
- I meant the other.
the other Marc Antony.

32
00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.070
- He killed
himself. didn't he?

33
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:43.904
- Oh. fuck it!

34
00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:44.772
What's it gonna be?

35
00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.440
- Juan Jose Ortado Moreno III.

36
00:01:46.474 --> 00:01:50.578
- Fuckin' hell. man!

37
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:51.745
- No. it's Juan Junior.

38
00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:53.581
- Jeez. that's such a
lack of imagination!

39
00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:55.583
- It's my name. man.
and my dad's name.

40
00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.751
- Yeah. but how many Juans do
we need in the world. right?

41
00:01:57.785 --> 00:01:58.919
- Just Juan.

42
00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.255
Like Juan Two and
Juan Three?

43
00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.625
Man. I can't believe we
have this calvary behind

44
00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:06.594
for such a small-time bust.

45
00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:09.096
It's over the top.
if you ask me.

46
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.631
These guys are small-timers.

47
00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.099
- Gotta take out
the small-timers

48
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.635
before they become
big-timers. right?

49
00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:15.769
- Right.

50
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.471
- Now. you sit and
stay here. all right?

51
00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:51.472
- Fuck you!

52
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:55.809
- Be right back.

53
00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:56.644
- Hey. don't say that.

54
00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:57.845
It's bad luck.

55
00:02:57.878 --> 00:02:59.012
I still need you to
pay for the baptism.

56
00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.681
- Yeah. are we done here?

57
00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:02.316
People got responsibilities.
important jobs to do.

58
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.151
Just leave it to the pros.

59
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.153
- Yeah. get
the fuck outta here.

60
00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:27.841
- Let's go. let's go. let's go!

61
00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:28.676
- Ándele!

62
00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.677
Rápido. rápido!

63
00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:37.518
- Atención!

64
00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:39.353
Esta es la DEA!

65
00:03:39.387 --> 00:03:41.221
- Ándele! Andele!

66
00:04:57.465 --> 00:04:58.799
- No. Fernando's not here yet.

67
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:06.974
No!

68
00:05:10.478 --> 00:05:11.979
- No. no. no.
.

69
00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.458
- Get up.

70
00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:25.959
Let's go.

71
00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:42.510
- Is everything okay?

72
00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:47.147
Your mom's gonna
say no either way.

73
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:02.696
- Cover me!

74
00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:11.004
Fucker!

75
00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.179
Heads up in the alley!

76
00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.180
- Well. I like the two bedroom.

77
00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.381
Why don't we get that one?

78
00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.518
Okay.

79
00:06:24.552 --> 00:06:25.553
Freeze!

80
00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:26.854
Drop your weapon!

81
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:31.191
- Shit!

82
00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:36.530
- Oh. my god!

83
00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:38.198
Oh. my god!

84
00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.533
Juan!

85
00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:41.535
- No. no. no. no. no. no!
- Oh. my god!

86
00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:42.870
- No. no. no. no. Juan!
- Oh. my god!

87
00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:44.037
- Fuckin' A.

88
00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:45.205
I need some help!

89
00:06:46.574 --> 00:06:47.708
- Oh. my god!
- Come on. man!

90
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:48.542
Just don't!

91
00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:49.877
Don't you fuckin' do this to me!

92
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.911
Come on. man!

93
00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:51.712
I know!

94
00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:52.713
Fuck!

95
00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:56.784
Fuck. man!

96
00:06:57.951 --> 00:06:59.720
I need some help!

97
00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:04.224
Come on. man!

98
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.092
Fuck. man!

99
00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:07.561
Jesus Christ!

100
00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:09.229
I'm so sorry. man!

101
00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:55.643
- Oh. my god!

102
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.612
I don't believe it!

103
00:07:58.646 --> 00:08:00.781
- Hi. Nick!

104
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.950
- How the hell did you find me?

105
00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:05.285
- It wasn't easy. but then
again. it wasn't that difficult.

106
00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.453
Permission to come aboard. sir?

107
00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.622
- Permission granted.
- Yeah. thank you.

108
00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:10.290
- Care for a libation?
- Always!

109
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.327
Whoo!

110
00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.631
So this is what retirement
in Mexico looks like?

111
00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:20.300
- Yeah. it's my house. I guess.

112
00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:23.804
I'm trying to remember.

113
00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:24.972
was that with water. or...

114
00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.173
Just a little

115
00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:27.975
ice in there. that's fine.
- All right.

116
00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.677
- Yeah!

117
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.980
I could get used to
this very easily.

118
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.315
- Yo!

119
00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.516
Oh. salut then.
- Salut.

120
00:08:40.688 --> 00:08:42.890
It's good to see you. Nick.

121
00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.192
Yeah.

122
00:08:46.694 --> 00:08:48.228
This isn't a social visit. Nick.

123
00:08:50.564 --> 00:08:53.166
I have three black warrants
I need you to execute.

124
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.202
- Maybe you didn't get the hints

125
00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:57.504
because of my formal attire.

126
00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.872
but I am retired.

127
00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:01.909
- Your country needs you.

128
00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:05.178
- Oh. Francis!

129
00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:07.180
You don't get it. do you?

130
00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:09.016
I mean. do you know
what my day is like?

131
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.518
And I'd say. pretty
much every day.

132
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.855
I get up in the
morning. I take a pee.

133
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.057
then I eat breakfast.
take a shit.

134
00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:20.027
possibly go into town.

135
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.030
The afternoon. I like
to grab a little siesta.

136
00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:26.566
And then at the end of
the day. a cocktail.

137
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.535
just like the one I'm
enjoying right now.

138
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.536
- And that's the
way you'd like to

139
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.738
spend the rest of your days?

140
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:33.040
- Well. I wouldn't
mind getting laid

141
00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.374
a little bit more often.

142
00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.377
but yeah. that's pretty much it.

143
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.912
- We have a mole in the agency.

144
00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:42.049
- Oh.
- By the time we

145
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.216
clear everybody
it'll be too late.

146
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.452
That's why we need you.
and we need you now.

147
00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.889
I got $600.000 in this bag.

148
00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.590
That's $200.000 a warrant.

149
00:09:55.262 --> 00:09:56.229
Imminent danger.

150
00:09:56.263 --> 00:09:57.898
We've got three. four days tops.

151
00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:08.742
- Let me get my readers.

152
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.245
- You must really be retired?

153
00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:13.280
- Yes. I am.

154
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.092
You folks must really
be up against the wall.

155
00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.126
- We are.

156
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:29.462
Yeah. it's nice!

157
00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:36.003
- Bin Farri?

158
00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:39.639
My god. that was 25 years ago!

159
00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:40.607
What is this?

160
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.109
- Well. you know.

161
00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.311
after everything went down
in Miami the way it did.

162
00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:45.478
he was untouchable.

163
00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:46.446
Too high profile.

164
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.981
We couldn't go after him again.

165
00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:50.150
Well. he's reappeared on the
radar with something very bad.

166
00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:56.123
Nick. before you say anything.

167
00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.958
I gotta let you
know. if you say no.

168
00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.159
well. there's a good chance

169
00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:00.961
that you might be
exposed about Miami.

170
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.130
- You son of a bitch!
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

171
00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:04.464
It's not me.

172
00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:05.332
You know I wouldn't do
something like that.

173
00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:06.633
It's those guys.

174
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.168
They can't take a
chance on you saying no.

175
00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:09.002
That's why they sent me.

176
00:11:09.036 --> 00:11:09.970
They know we're friends.

177
00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.304
- Oh. some friend you are!

178
00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:12.973
- You've got a lot
of balls sayin' that.

179
00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.141
- Huh?

180
00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.143
- After everything
I did for your son?

181
00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.310
The son you abandoned?

182
00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:19.146
If that doesn't
prove our friendship.

183
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.647
I don't know what does.

184
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.815
What the hell kinda thing
is that to say to me?

185
00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:23.316
- That's not what I'm saying!
- Look-

186
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.484
Okay. yeah.

187
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.153
Well. don't think I'm
enjoying bein' here

188
00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:27.520
layin' all this shit on ya!

189
00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.158
Nick. I wouldn't be here

190
00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.526
if this wasn't a situation
of national security.

191
00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:37.865
- And who's
the other guy?

192
00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:39.833
- Oh. that's Polat. the Turk.

193
00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:41.334
You take him out.

194
00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.837
and. well. Bin Farri's whole
money laundering scheme

195
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:44.704
goes to hell.

196
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.207
And this guy's some character.

197
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.878
He has a large appetite
for 12-year-old girls.

198
00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.847
12-year-old girls
turned prostitutes

199
00:11:53.881 --> 00:11:55.515
by Bin Farri and his people.

200
00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.383
- Jesus!

201
00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:03.356
This one?
- That's Mustafar.

202
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.524
He introduced Bin Farri

203
00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.860
to a number of
terrorist organizations.

204
00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:09.029
We have confirmation that
they have a cargo shipment

205
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.230
comin' in to Mexico.

206
00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:13.100
We believe it's
biological weapons.

207
00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.702
Yeah.

208
00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.204
This is serious.

209
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.071
- Well...

210
00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:20.040
- Come on. buddy.

211
00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:20.908
You can do this.

212
00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:24.912
It'll be like old times.

213
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:28.548
And I'll tell you what.

214
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.050
if they ask you to do
anything after this.

215
00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.885
I promise you I'll tell
'em to go fuck themselves.

216
00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:33.253
- Oh!
- I will!

217
00:12:33.286 --> 00:12:34.221
And I'll quit.

218
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.222
- Ho-ho!
- I will!

219
00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.723
I'll quit. and I'll come.

220
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.559
and. well. I'll live with
you on this floating mansion.

221
00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:40.794
I'll be your first mate.

222
00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.763
What do you say?

223
00:12:43.797 --> 00:12:47.134
- Frankie. if you do
that. remember this.

224
00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:52.072
Out at sea. I am in command.

225
00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.774
- Aye aye. Captain.

226
00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:06.619
- Hey. man.

227
00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:10.924
I would encourage you to
ask for a permanent transfer

228
00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.325
to another field office.

229
00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:15.428
- I'm good.

230
00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:16.496
- You sure?

231
00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:19.432
Okay.
- What do you got for me?

232
00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:24.471
- So San Mar was
bought five months ago.

233
00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:27.607
They import chandeliers from
China and all their parts.

234
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.808
They assemble them.

235
00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.113
then wholesale them
to distributors all
around the country.

236
00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.281
Papers are straight.

237
00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:36.116
They're clean as a whistle.

238
00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.617
- The shooter?

239
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.122
- Confirmed to be Zacarias
Zapata. a.k.a. Zico.

240
00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.491
He was locked up in El
Hongo. last I heard.

241
00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:47.961
but somebody must have paid
lots of money to get him out.

242
00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:49.963
- You're telling me

243
00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:52.799
there are no bad apples
in that entire barrel?

244
00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.001
Come on!

245
00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:56.303
- No one seems to
know who Zico is.

246
00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.971
They're probably lying.

247
00:13:58.005 --> 00:14:00.507
but I would. if I was
them. too. you know?

248
00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:03.843
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

249
00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:06.313
- What is it?

250
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:07.647
- Polat.

251
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.815
- Polat?

252
00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:09.983
- Yeah.

253
00:14:10.017 --> 00:14:11.484
- Who
the hell's Polat?

254
00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:12.819
- The manager.

255
00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.321
He's the only non-Mexican there.

256
00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.855
I don't know. somethin'
just rubbed me

257
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:18.158
the wrong way about him.
so I ran his prints.

258
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.342
I was about to come find you.

259
00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.209
Come here.

260
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.012
- I know.

261
00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:40.513
I heard it.

262
00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:41.514
- What do you mean?

263
00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:44.551
- I was on the phone with him.

264
00:14:44.584 --> 00:14:46.353
- Jesus!

265
00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:47.687
- I heard everything.

266
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.356
- I'm so sorry.

267
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.706
- Two fucking hours!

268
00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:09.409
- What?

269
00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:10.710
- I've been waiting
for two hours

270
00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:11.878
to take a piss.

271
00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.547
- Sorry. it's been busy here.

272
00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:15.715
- I didn't shoot anyone.

273
00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.717
I don't know who that guy was.

274
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.386
I never saw that person
in my entire life.

275
00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.720
- Just shut the fuck up.

276
00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:21.788
Yeah?
- Jesus!

277
00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:26.893
- So what do you do for San Mar?

278
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.962
- I manage the
shipping and receiving.

279
00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.598
- You wanna try that again?

280
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.134
Polat?

281
00:15:36.103 --> 00:15:37.570
- Polat.

282
00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:39.072
Who is that?

283
00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:42.742
- FBI. Interpol. Europol.
Turkish Intelligence.

284
00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.245
Shit. man. you got warrants
out from all of them!

285
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.247
How long you been
on the run. hmm?

286
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.748
- It's been a while.

287
00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.250
- Money laundering.
though. that's...

288
00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:51.418
It's good business.

289
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.420
- Until someone gets pissed off.

290
00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:56.289
or you get caught. like this.

291
00:15:56.323 --> 00:15:57.124
I get it!

292
00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:59.092
I'm in shit!

293
00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:00.593
Okay!

294
00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:02.629
Listen.

295
00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:04.797
This is going to be
like Christmas for you.

296
00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:09.436
Okay. I'm going to give you
exactly who you really want.

297
00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:10.803
- Oh. yeah?

298
00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:12.972
And who do we really want?

299
00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:17.144
- You make me a deal.

300
00:16:17.177 --> 00:16:20.480
and I will give you
Hussein Bin Farri.

301
00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.119
- Now who the fuck is that?

302
00:16:26.153 --> 00:16:27.620
- You don't know
Hussein Bin Farri?

303
00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:28.788
- No.
- No. we don't know.

304
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.457
- Are you fucking with me?

305
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.991
Do you live in a cave?

306
00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:35.495
- There is Rashida Bin Farri
at the new cultural center.

307
00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:36.796
Nice woman.

308
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:39.466
- No. no. no. no.
that's the niece.

309
00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.800
She is...

310
00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:41.801
Nevermind!

311
00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.803
This guy. he's a
terrorist. okay?

312
00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.672
- Okay. what the fuck is
this guy talking about?

313
00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:46.839
- Hey. gringo!

314
00:16:46.873 --> 00:16:48.475
You've heard of Bin Laden. yeah?

315
00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.642
- Yeah.

316
00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:50.477
- You think Bin Laden
was a terrorist?

317
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.478
- Yeah.

318
00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:52.679
- This guy says to Bin Laden.

319
00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:55.648
"Hey. Osama. get the
fuck out of my way!"

320
00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.650
- Okay.

321
00:16:57.684 --> 00:17:00.653
- So señor. if I was you.

322
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:04.824
I would pay careful attention
to everything I have to say.

323
00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:07.527
But first. we talk deal.

324
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:12.999
Then I give you everything
about the operation.

325
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.667
- What operation?

326
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.035
- You fucking people!

327
00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:20.673
I will give you a
very small hint. okay?

328
00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:23.376
Unless you do
something to stop him.

329
00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:29.048
Bin Farri is going to level
the United States economy.

330
00:17:29.082 --> 00:17:33.052
And then any country that has
extra cash laying around. hmm?

331
00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.057
- Are you talking about a bomb?

332
00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:40.893
- Better.

333
00:17:40.927 --> 00:17:43.530
They have some
fancy-schmancy machine.

334
00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:46.533
It was unloading when you
guys made your freaky scene.

335
00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:49.902
- You talkin' about
that van outside?

336
00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:51.371
I don't know.

337
00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:52.705
Those guys. they were
just unloadin' somethin'.

338
00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:53.873
They were all clean.

339
00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.042
They were unloading a
chandelier or some shit.

340
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:57.410
- A chandelier. huh?
- Yeah.

341
00:17:57.444 --> 00:17:59.712
- Can a chandelier turn
off a whole country?

342
00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:01.881
Because this one does!

343
00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.250
- What are you talking about?

344
00:18:03.283 --> 00:18:04.717
Turn off a country?

345
00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:07.220
- No more until
you make me a deal.

346
00:18:07.254 --> 00:18:10.557
As example of good
faith negotiation.

347
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.226
I will give you all the goods

348
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.094
on Bin Farri's shell companies

349
00:18:15.128 --> 00:18:17.063
where he launders his money.

350
00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:19.566
I just need access to my laptop.

351
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:20.933
- This guy sounds like a snake.

352
00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:23.069
just willing to
give up his boss.

353
00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:24.937
- Yeah. well. under
these circumstances.

354
00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:28.241
I'm entitled to go through
a selfish phase. no?

355
00:18:29.476 --> 00:18:30.577
- I need some water.

356
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.445
You want some water?
- Yeah.

357
00:18:32.479 --> 00:18:34.080
- I still need to piss.

358
00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:35.948
But sure. okay.

359
00:18:35.982 --> 00:18:36.949
I'll take some water.

360
00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:38.918
but it has to be
sparkling water.

361
00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.920
Perrier. Pellegrino.
something like that.

362
00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.922
- I'll send someone
to take you to piss.

363
00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.592
- I don't
trust the water here.

364
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.633
- So Agent Vanowen...

365
00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:56.102
- Fuck.
I gotta take a piss!

366
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:56.969
Come on!

367
00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:58.971
- What do you think?

368
00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.610
- I mean. shit.

369
00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:04.811
Gotta call the FBI.

370
00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.280
- Hey. you guys!

371
00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:09.616
You may wanna let the FBI
know about this. huh?!

372
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.452
This shit is going
to blow their minds!

373
00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.187
They'll give me a
better deal. huh?

374
00:19:15.188 --> 00:19:16.456
Hello?!

375
00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.957
Hello?!

376
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.659
- I swear.
- Also.

377
00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:21.160
when you extradite me.

378
00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:23.463
and I'm sure you're going
to want to extradite me.

379
00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:28.501
I want a nice suite in
a flashy boutique hotel.

380
00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:30.637
- All right. I'll call the FBI.

381
00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.838
- Yeah.
- Okay?

382
00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:36.509
Tell them I want a
total immunity agreement

383
00:19:36.543 --> 00:19:38.144
approved by my attorney.

384
00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:39.011
He's in Texas.

385
00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:41.147
I'll give you the number.

386
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.482
Are you there?!

387
00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:43.483
I have to piss!

388
00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:45.818
- Yeah. go fuck yourself!

389
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:43.109
- Vanowen.

390
00:20:44.277 --> 00:20:45.077
Yes. sir.

391
00:21:09.135 --> 00:21:09.969
- Nick.

392
00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.107
Roger that.

393
00:21:15.141 --> 00:21:16.743
Oh.

394
00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.245
You got a room number?

395
00:22:05.358 --> 00:22:08.628
All before noon?

396
00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:09.996
Muí bien.

397
00:22:15.034 --> 00:22:15.968
Eh?

398
00:22:18.371 --> 00:22:20.973
No. we don't want
.

399
00:22:21.007 --> 00:22:23.510
No. no. no. no.

400
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:50.202
Let's make it an even 200.

401
00:23:27.073 --> 00:23:28.708
- Gracias.

402
00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:30.409
- Hey!
- Hey. what's up?

403
00:23:30.443 --> 00:23:32.244
- So the Turk wasn't lying.

404
00:23:32.278 --> 00:23:34.046
- FBI got their
panties in a bunch.

405
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.081
I gotta take him to the border.

406
00:23:35.114 --> 00:23:36.082
- When?

407
00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:37.249
- Right now.

408
00:23:37.283 --> 00:23:39.251
- Well. he's technically
not been detained.

409
00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:41.721
so basically. you're
taking him for a car ride.

410
00:23:41.754 --> 00:23:43.556
- Yeah. the FBI. they'll
pick him up there.

411
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.724
- Okay. I'll get you an escort.

412
00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:45.892
- No. no. no. I'm good.

413
00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:47.560
- No. you should
really take an escort

414
00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:49.061
to get him across the border.

415
00:23:49.095 --> 00:23:50.730
- I don't wanna draw any more
attention than I have to.

416
00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:51.764
- Okay then.

417
00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:05.137
- Hey. chica.

418
00:25:05.171 --> 00:25:07.473
Any chance they could
send us another girl

419
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:11.644
to work on my legs while you-

420
00:25:11.678 --> 00:25:14.313
I may not get one of
these for a while. huh?

421
00:25:21.688 --> 00:25:24.691
Maybe afterwards. we can
have ourselves a little

422
00:25:25.692 --> 00:25:28.527
Turkish/Mexican ménage à trois?

423
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:32.699
What say you. darling?

424
00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:38.537
Go low. yeah.

425
00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:44.844
It's time to go. Polat.

426
00:25:44.877 --> 00:25:45.878
- No! What?

427
00:25:46.713 --> 00:25:48.014
Come on!

428
00:25:48.047 --> 00:25:49.048
- We gotta go.

429
00:25:49.081 --> 00:25:50.049
- Why?!

430
00:25:51.718 --> 00:25:53.019
She hasn't even
done my legs yet.

431
00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:54.186
- I don't care.

432
00:25:59.726 --> 00:26:00.860
- Where is my lawyer?

433
00:26:00.893 --> 00:26:02.695
- He's gonna meet
you on US soil. okay?

434
00:26:02.729 --> 00:26:04.363
But we gotta leave
this hotel now. so.

435
00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:05.698
- I'm supposed to have
two more days here. man.

436
00:26:05.732 --> 00:26:07.867
- The party is over. dickhead.

437
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.035
Pack up your shit!

438
00:26:09.068 --> 00:26:10.536
- Okay. okay!

439
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.071
Every party has a pooper.

440
00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:21.547
Why you in a shit mood
all the time. huh?

441
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.883
Life is good. man.

442
00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:25.251
You get ulcers.

443
00:26:25.284 --> 00:26:27.219
How 'bout you and I make a deal?

444
00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:29.221
How 'bout you drive me
to the airport instead.

445
00:26:29.255 --> 00:26:31.758
and I give you the password
for my laptop. okay?

446
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:32.759
I give you the password.

447
00:26:32.792 --> 00:26:34.060
and I will give you the location

448
00:26:34.093 --> 00:26:36.929
of the man who shot your friend.

449
00:26:36.963 --> 00:26:38.230
Come on!

450
00:26:38.264 --> 00:26:39.565
You will have all of
Bin Farri's assets.

451
00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:41.400
You will get his
friends in the scene.

452
00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.769
You will get Bin Farri.

453
00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:46.739
Tell them I had a gun on you.

454
00:26:46.773 --> 00:26:47.774
We can make it work!

455
00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:50.743
Come on. man.

456
00:26:50.777 --> 00:26:53.579
I will deposit $5
million for you

457
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:55.081
in any account in the world.

458
00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:56.916
100% untraceable.

459
00:26:56.949 --> 00:26:58.785
I can do it from
your cell phone.

460
00:26:59.952 --> 00:27:02.121
Give half the money to
the widow. if you want.

461
00:27:02.154 --> 00:27:03.422
I don't care.

462
00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:06.959
I'll make it 10 million.

463
00:27:06.993 --> 00:27:09.428
but we have to act now!

464
00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:10.596
Come on. man.

465
00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:12.932
- Let's go.

466
00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:13.933
Let's go.
- Come on. man!

467
00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:15.434
Fuckin' hell. man.

468
00:27:18.805 --> 00:27:19.772
Hey. señor. watch it!

469
00:27:19.806 --> 00:27:20.773
Be careful!

470
00:27:20.807 --> 00:27:22.441
That's a $3.000 case. man!

471
00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:23.943
Not a fucking laundry basket!
- Get in the fucking car!

472
00:27:30.316 --> 00:27:31.450
- Fuck!

473
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.806
No!

474
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.141
Not a fucking fence!

475
00:28:34.881 --> 00:28:35.714
- Vanowen.

476
00:28:37.383 --> 00:28:41.520
So his cell phone data shows
that he was at Vista Parallax.

477
00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.856
which is a higher-end
looking place.

478
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.358
He was there at least
six times this month.

479
00:28:46.392 --> 00:28:48.861
So we set up a stakeout
across the street.

480
00:28:48.895 --> 00:28:51.898
And since your witness
literally lost his mind.

481
00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:54.901
I thought you might
want to stay occupied

482
00:28:54.934 --> 00:28:56.869
and fill in a hole
in the rotation.

483
00:28:56.903 --> 00:28:58.704
We have eyes on the place.

484
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.406
- Okay. I'll give 'em a call.

485
00:29:00.439 --> 00:29:02.374
- I already did and
you got approved.

486
00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:04.210
Just as a reinforcement.

487
00:29:04.243 --> 00:29:07.379
This is not a DEA
operation. okay?

488
00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:08.747
Just watch the place.

489
00:29:08.781 --> 00:29:10.582
And it wasn't your
fault. Vanowen.

490
00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:15.554
Live and learn.

491
00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:17.890
Next time. you take
an escort with you.

492
00:30:29.195 --> 00:30:30.129
- I'll be right back.

493
00:30:30.162 --> 00:30:31.463
I'm gonna get some audio.

494
00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:57.189
- Hello.
- Hello.

495
00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:02.528
Just one.
- Of course.

496
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:03.395
This way. please.

497
00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:10.669
- How do
I get over here?

498
00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:12.171
- That's
the VIP section.

499
00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:14.540
- Ahh. how do I become a VIP?

500
00:31:15.908 --> 00:31:18.344
- VIPs don't need to
tell anyone they're VIPs.

501
00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:20.846
- Okay.

502
00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:22.181
- I'll be
back to take your order.

503
00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:26.778
- Sorry?

504
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.251
Shit!

505
00:32:35.121 --> 00:32:36.122
Do I know you?

506
00:32:36.155 --> 00:32:37.923
- No. you don't.

507
00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:40.092
- Ah. I'm pretty sure
I've seen you before.

508
00:32:40.126 --> 00:32:41.427
- I'm sure you have.

509
00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.929
- No. the Parallax. right?

510
00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:44.796
- How do you know?

511
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.598
- I've been there a few times.

512
00:32:46.632 --> 00:32:47.599
Seen you around.

513
00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:48.634
- I'm usually in the kitchen.

514
00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:49.801
- Oh. Anthony.

515
00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:52.471
- I still don't remember you.

516
00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:54.973
- Can we talk?

517
00:32:55.007 --> 00:32:57.309
- Listen. I'm not used to
speed dating at the market.

518
00:32:58.477 --> 00:32:59.611
- No. no. I'm not
trying to hit on you.

519
00:32:59.645 --> 00:33:00.946
I was just hoping we
could talk in private.

520
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:03.782
so I don't get into trouble.

521
00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:04.650
Por favor?

522
00:33:05.684 --> 00:33:06.485
Come on.

523
00:33:10.189 --> 00:33:11.790
- I have nothing
to do with the business

524
00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:14.160
or anything that goes on there.

525
00:33:14.193 --> 00:33:15.961
I just make food.

526
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:17.963
- No. I know.

527
00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:18.830
I know.

528
00:33:18.864 --> 00:33:20.966
- So what do you want from me?

529
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:23.135
- What's your name?
- Mina.

530
00:33:23.169 --> 00:33:24.836
- Mina. Mina. that's nice.

531
00:33:26.338 --> 00:33:28.640
I got a big favor
to ask from you.

532
00:33:28.674 --> 00:33:30.142
- From me?

533
00:33:30.176 --> 00:33:32.844
- Yeah. I need you to place this

534
00:33:32.878 --> 00:33:35.647
underneath the VIP
table at the Parallax.

535
00:33:35.681 --> 00:33:37.516
- No!

536
00:33:38.517 --> 00:33:39.818
Why?

537
00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:41.553
- It's for an investigation
the DEA's running.

538
00:33:42.721 --> 00:33:44.490
- Are they selling
drugs in there?

539
00:33:44.523 --> 00:33:46.158
Fuck!
- Maybe.

540
00:33:46.192 --> 00:33:48.527
- Are you gonna be
shutting down the Parallax?

541
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.695
- Why?

542
00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:51.497
- So I can start
looking for another job.

543
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:52.998
- No. no. no. I...

544
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:53.832
Gosh.

545
00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:54.833
I don't know. okay?

546
00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.368
But I doubt the people involved

547
00:33:56.402 --> 00:33:58.170
have anything to do with
the actual business. okay?

548
00:33:58.204 --> 00:34:00.672
But there's only
one way to find out.

549
00:34:00.706 --> 00:34:03.375
I mean. no one would
ever know it was you.

550
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:05.511
- There's lots of cameras.

551
00:34:05.544 --> 00:34:06.845
- Just stick it under the table.

552
00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:07.713
That's all.

553
00:34:11.417 --> 00:34:12.551
- What's in it for me?

554
00:34:14.086 --> 00:34:15.687
- Come on!

555
00:34:15.721 --> 00:34:17.189
This'll take you
like 10 seconds.

556
00:34:17.223 --> 00:34:18.890
- I don't know. that
expression on your face

557
00:34:18.924 --> 00:34:21.193
tells me this is
a buyer's market.

558
00:34:21.227 --> 00:34:23.695
- Am I the buyer or the seller?

559
00:34:23.729 --> 00:34:25.531
- You are the seller.

560
00:34:25.564 --> 00:34:26.698
- Okay.

561
00:34:26.732 --> 00:34:27.733
- How about this?

562
00:34:29.568 --> 00:34:31.370
I do this thing for you.

563
00:34:31.403 --> 00:34:33.372
and then we get married.

564
00:34:33.405 --> 00:34:34.540
so I can get a green card.

565
00:34:34.573 --> 00:34:36.242
so I can join the CIA.

566
00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:40.045
- You wanna join the CIA?

567
00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:42.881
- The Culinary
Institute of America.

568
00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.250
It's in New York.

569
00:34:44.283 --> 00:34:46.885
Best cooking school in the US.

570
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:48.720
- Wow! Okay.

571
00:34:48.754 --> 00:34:50.422
Let me think about that.

572
00:34:50.456 --> 00:34:53.058
Did not plan on getting
married anytime soon.

573
00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:53.925
- I'm just kidding.

574
00:34:55.261 --> 00:34:56.562
You're not even my type.

575
00:34:56.595 --> 00:34:58.230
- Ouch!

576
00:34:58.264 --> 00:34:59.765
- Gotta go to work now.

577
00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:13.078
I'll do it.

578
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:14.480
but you will owe me one.

579
00:35:17.783 --> 00:35:18.584
- Of course.

580
00:35:18.617 --> 00:35:20.252
Don't tell anyone.

581
00:35:20.286 --> 00:35:22.454
- If I get fired. it's
gonna be your fault.

582
00:35:23.322 --> 00:35:25.090
- Fair enough.

583
00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:28.093
- You know. when you
were talking to me
back at the market.

584
00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:29.795
before I knew you
were a law man.

585
00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:32.664
I actually thought
it was my lucky day.

586
00:36:13.505 --> 00:36:15.173
- All
right. here she goes.

587
00:36:35.694 --> 00:36:36.528
Hell yeah!

588
00:36:47.239 --> 00:36:48.507
Yeah.

589
00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:50.736
Hey. let me get that.

590
00:37:55.941 --> 00:37:56.908
- How are
you doing. my friend?

591
00:37:56.942 --> 00:37:58.076
- Good. how are you?
- Good.

592
00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:00.078
Welcome to Tijuana.
- Thank you.

593
00:38:14.793 --> 00:38:15.927
- Do
you enjoy hookahs?

594
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:18.597
- Thank you. but
I prefer to work first.

595
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:19.765
- Everything okay?

596
00:38:19.798 --> 00:38:22.601
- That's why you're here.

597
00:38:22.634 --> 00:38:24.102
- So
tell me. Fernando.

598
00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.771
how come you cost
me so much money

599
00:38:25.804 --> 00:38:27.473
after I pay for everything else?

600
00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.108
Let me see it.

601
00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:31.109
Where is it?

602
00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:32.611
- Do you have payment?

603
00:38:32.644 --> 00:38:34.446
- Half
as agreed now.

604
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.315
the rest after it's installed.

605
00:38:48.994 --> 00:38:50.629
So want a hit?

606
00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:52.130
- The machine's hardwired

607
00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.800
to a local cellular network.

608
00:38:54.833 --> 00:38:55.667
- No. no!

609
00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:59.805
Where the fuck are they goin'?

610
00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:29.535
- Watch out there.

611
00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.921
- What the hell is that. guys?

612
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.525
Come on!

613
00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:08.740
All right.

614
00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.381
I can't believe it.

615
00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:17.248
- It's all here.

616
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.722
Easier than take-out.

617
00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:25.591
Please. try it yourself.

618
00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:34.900
- Motherfucker!

619
00:40:34.933 --> 00:40:36.234
Come on!

620
00:40:40.606 --> 00:40:42.073
- It's just
like changing a TV channel.

621
00:40:51.617 --> 00:40:52.918
- But next time.

622
00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:54.786
it could be the
entire power grid

623
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.288
on the east side of
the United States.

624
00:40:58.456 --> 00:40:59.758
- So we're
done here then?

625
00:40:59.791 --> 00:41:01.259
Congratulations.

626
00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:02.093
Are we still on for tomorrow?

627
00:41:02.127 --> 00:41:03.128
- Of course.

628
00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:05.931
- Let's eat then.

629
00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:13.104
- Who's there?

630
00:41:22.013 --> 00:41:23.448
- Let him shoot!
- Yeah. follow me!

631
00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:25.283
Let's go!

632
00:41:40.165 --> 00:41:45.170
- What the fuck?

633
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.311
- DEA. freeze!

634
00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:15.200
DEA. drop the weapon!

635
00:42:16.868 --> 00:42:17.836
Drop it.

636
00:42:21.372 --> 00:42:23.341
Fuck!

637
00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:02.273
- What happened?

638
00:44:02.307 --> 00:44:03.775
- Yeah. you shouldn't be here.

639
00:44:03.809 --> 00:44:05.310
- What did you do?

640
00:44:05.343 --> 00:44:06.778
- Me?! Nothin'.

641
00:44:06.812 --> 00:44:08.947
- Is this because of the-
- No. no. no. no.

642
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.281
Definitely not.

643
00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:20.625
- Was
he actually here?

644
00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:21.827
- Yeah. yeah.

645
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.794
No. someone knew
he'd be here. so.

646
00:44:22.828 --> 00:44:24.629
- Right under our fucking noses?

647
00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:25.496
- Yep.

648
00:44:27.999 --> 00:44:28.867
- Well...

649
00:44:30.335 --> 00:44:32.337
So that's Zico. for sure.

650
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.638
- Yeah.

651
00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:35.707
- And the other guy
there was Bin Farri.

652
00:44:37.843 --> 00:44:39.644
These guys are like bodyguards.

653
00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:42.513
and who the fuck is the cowboy?

654
00:44:42.547 --> 00:44:44.482
The other ones. I don't
know who they are.

655
00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:47.819
- Yeah. we lost
power a few times.

656
00:44:47.853 --> 00:44:51.656
- Yeah. the whole city
went dark twice last night

657
00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:53.158
without no reason.

658
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:54.359
- Wait. wait. the entire city?

659
00:44:54.392 --> 00:44:55.693
- The entire city.

660
00:44:58.196 --> 00:44:59.831
- All right. you know what?

661
00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.168
The camera had a battery.

662
00:45:03.201 --> 00:45:05.036
I bet it recorded everything.

663
00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:23.721
- Fuck off!

664
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:25.423
- It was them.

665
00:45:27.392 --> 00:45:28.393
- Holy shit!

666
00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:31.562
Oh. this can't be good.

667
00:45:31.596 --> 00:45:34.866
- No. I mean. if you
think that's bad. I bet...

668
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.202
Shit. man. I bet that
was just a rehearsal.

669
00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:38.069
- Fuck!

670
00:45:40.405 --> 00:45:41.239
- Yeah.

671
00:45:58.423 --> 00:46:00.558
- Okay. here it is.

672
00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:01.559
Where do you want it?

673
00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:07.098
- I have something to show you.

674
00:46:08.433 --> 00:46:10.435
I will transfer the
money right away.

675
00:46:10.468 --> 00:46:12.904
- I need the money
you already owed me.

676
00:46:12.938 --> 00:46:13.905
- What money?

677
00:46:13.939 --> 00:46:15.740
- Your guys showed me the money.

678
00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:17.742
then I demonstrated
the system to you.

679
00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:19.277
Suddenly. I was being shot at.

680
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:22.613
- It seems that the
money is missing.

681
00:46:22.647 --> 00:46:24.449
but don't worry. we
will make it up to you.

682
00:46:24.482 --> 00:46:25.616
- Look. I just want my money.

683
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:26.952
and I'm out of here. okay?

684
00:46:27.953 --> 00:46:28.954
- Please follow me.

685
00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:36.627
Khalil was going to
do the work here.

686
00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:38.429
Now. you must do it.

687
00:46:38.463 --> 00:46:39.264
- Me? No.

688
00:46:39.297 --> 00:46:40.098
No fucking way!

689
00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:41.099
I made what you wanted.

690
00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:42.433
I am delivering what you wanted.

691
00:46:42.467 --> 00:46:43.935
and I showed you that it works.

692
00:46:43.969 --> 00:46:46.437
I did my job and I
need to be paid now.

693
00:46:46.471 --> 00:46:48.273
- What can I offer you
to change your mind?

694
00:46:48.306 --> 00:46:49.774
- I watched my cousin
get killed because of you.

695
00:46:49.807 --> 00:46:52.443
- I'll give you three
times what we agreed.

696
00:46:52.477 --> 00:46:53.311
- $30 million?

697
00:46:56.147 --> 00:46:57.615
- As long as you
give me your word

698
00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:59.985
that you will stay
until the job is done.

699
00:47:02.487 --> 00:47:03.955
I'll do it right now.

700
00:47:13.331 --> 00:47:14.165
- 50 million.

701
00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:16.968
- 50?

702
00:47:17.002 --> 00:47:18.803
- Before you fuck up
the global economy.

703
00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:20.371
I'd like to have some security.

704
00:47:24.876 --> 00:47:26.978
- How long will it take?

705
00:47:27.012 --> 00:47:28.146
- A day or two.

706
00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:29.981
plus whatever the code
takes to propagate

707
00:47:30.015 --> 00:47:31.349
all over the internet.

708
00:47:34.352 --> 00:47:35.486
- Okay.

709
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.354
- Okay.

710
00:48:38.583 --> 00:48:39.550
- Stunning.

711
00:48:39.584 --> 00:48:40.718
Thank you so much for...

712
00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:41.552
You making it here

713
00:48:41.586 --> 00:48:43.921
is a completely-
- Hi.

714
00:48:44.922 --> 00:48:46.391
Anthony Vanowen.

715
00:48:46.424 --> 00:48:47.225
- Rashida Bin Farri.

716
00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:48.726
It's a pleasure to meet you.

717
00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:51.562
- Is there somewhere we
could speak in private?

718
00:48:51.596 --> 00:48:52.430
- About what?

719
00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:55.266
- Hussein Bin Farri.
- My uncle?

720
00:48:56.634 --> 00:48:58.303
Why don't you talk
to him yourself?

721
00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:02.573
- Actually. I'd
rather speak with you.

722
00:49:02.607 --> 00:49:03.741
- Excuse me.

723
00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:05.076
Are you police?

724
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:05.943
- DEA.

725
00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:08.746
- DEA.

726
00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:09.914
Do you think my uncle.

727
00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:12.250
who's funded most
of this institution.

728
00:49:12.283 --> 00:49:14.252
is somehow involved
in illegal narcotics?

729
00:49:14.285 --> 00:49:16.087
- No. it's not about that.

730
00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:17.588
- Good evening. sir.
- Hi.

731
00:49:17.622 --> 00:49:19.257
- Hope you're enjoying yourself?

732
00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:20.958
- Absolutely.
- Hmmm.

733
00:49:22.493 --> 00:49:23.961
- Mina. my darling.
would you make sure

734
00:49:23.995 --> 00:49:26.431
everyone has champagne
by the end of my speech?

735
00:49:26.464 --> 00:49:27.265
- Of course.

736
00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:29.800
Excuse me.

737
00:49:29.834 --> 00:49:31.136
- Excuse
me. I have to go.

738
00:49:31.169 --> 00:49:32.303
- Is there any way...

739
00:49:32.337 --> 00:49:33.604
It's very important
that we speak.

740
00:49:33.638 --> 00:49:34.939
- I have to go.

741
00:49:34.972 --> 00:49:36.141
Call my office.

742
00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.344
- Sure.

743
00:50:47.712 --> 00:50:49.380
- That's the same guy
who tried to stop us

744
00:50:49.414 --> 00:50:51.182
outside the Parallax.

745
00:50:51.216 --> 00:50:53.518
- Our
guests of honor for the night.

746
00:50:53.551 --> 00:50:54.519
- The shooter?

747
00:50:54.552 --> 00:50:56.020
- Has to have been.
- No.

748
00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.388
I've seen him before.

749
00:50:58.223 --> 00:51:00.024
He's DEA.

750
00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:01.892
He was outside the
San Mar warehouse.

751
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:08.399
- Did you know the DEA
had a history with San Mar

752
00:51:08.433 --> 00:51:09.434
before we bought it?

753
00:51:10.568 --> 00:51:11.702
- No.

754
00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:14.539
- So you didn't know

755
00:51:14.572 --> 00:51:16.574
that the San Mar
brothers smuggled drugs?

756
00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:19.210
- No.

757
00:51:19.244 --> 00:51:20.578
- Then why is the
DEA up my ass?!

758
00:51:24.415 --> 00:51:26.584
Go do something about it.

759
00:51:28.085 --> 00:51:30.221
Make sure it's him.

760
00:51:34.425 --> 00:51:35.726
- That's the guy!

761
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.264
I know it's him.

762
00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:32.817
- Shit!

763
00:52:37.655 --> 00:52:38.489
- Gracias.

764
00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:43.994
Are you gonna follow me again?

765
00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:46.331
- What are you doin' out here?

766
00:52:46.364 --> 00:52:47.665
- I'm done for the night.

767
00:52:49.334 --> 00:52:50.635
- You happen to see a old guy

768
00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:53.804
come out here.
like. seconds ago?

769
00:52:53.838 --> 00:52:55.206
- You mean the guy in the Jeep?

770
00:52:56.341 --> 00:52:57.675
- Old guy?

771
00:52:57.708 --> 00:52:58.809
- That's him right now.

772
00:52:58.843 --> 00:52:59.844
He just left.

773
00:53:05.049 --> 00:53:06.484
- Shit!

774
00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:07.818
Is this you?
- Mm-hmm.

775
00:53:07.852 --> 00:53:09.320
- Go ahead. get in.

776
00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:12.156
We're gonna follow him.

777
00:53:18.363 --> 00:53:19.830
- Did you catch him smoking weed

778
00:53:19.864 --> 00:53:21.198
in the bathroom or something?

779
00:53:21.232 --> 00:53:22.199
- What? No. no!

780
00:53:23.368 --> 00:53:24.702
- Why are
we following him?

781
00:53:30.375 --> 00:53:31.509
- Come on!

782
00:53:31.542 --> 00:53:32.510
Look. look.
You're gonna lose him.

783
00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:34.178
- You wanted me to follow him.

784
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:35.713
I'm following him.

785
00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:38.383
- You should
turn the lights off.

786
00:53:38.416 --> 00:53:40.184
- You're getting a
little too pushy. okay?

787
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:41.386
I don't like that.

788
00:53:42.887 --> 00:53:43.688
- Look. I'm sorry.

789
00:53:43.721 --> 00:53:44.522
I just...

790
00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:46.190
I cannot lose him.

791
00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:47.358
- Happy?

792
00:53:47.392 --> 00:53:48.426
I can't see anything.

793
00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:50.861
- Your
eyes will adjust.

794
00:53:50.895 --> 00:53:52.229
- By the
time my eyes adjust

795
00:53:52.263 --> 00:53:54.064
we're gonna be
wrapped around a pole.

796
00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:56.033
- Wow.

797
00:54:00.771 --> 00:54:01.906
- So now what?

798
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:06.110
What did he do?

799
00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:08.713
- Okay.

800
00:54:08.746 --> 00:54:11.215
I mean. I guess I could
tell you.

801
00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:13.551
I think that guy-
- No. no. no. no. no.

802
00:54:13.584 --> 00:54:14.752
Wait. wait. wait. no.

803
00:54:14.785 --> 00:54:16.721
I don't wanna know.

804
00:54:16.754 --> 00:54:19.390
I just changed my mind.
just like right now.

805
00:54:19.424 --> 00:54:20.591
Don't tell me anything.

806
00:54:20.625 --> 00:54:22.226
Don't you tell me anything.

807
00:54:22.259 --> 00:54:23.728
because I don't wanna have
to testify about anything.

808
00:54:23.761 --> 00:54:25.229
Nevermind.

809
00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:27.765
- I'm sorry if
any of this scared you. or...

810
00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:31.436
- Scared me?

811
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.472
What is wrong with you?

812
00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:37.274
- Nothing.

813
00:54:37.308 --> 00:54:38.909
It's just the way you're
lookin' at me right now

814
00:54:38.943 --> 00:54:41.612
is making me think. I
don't know. maybe...

815
00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:49.920
- So what's next?

816
00:54:49.954 --> 00:54:51.422
I'll help.

817
00:54:51.456 --> 00:54:54.425
Even if it's just another
little job like the microphone.

818
00:54:54.459 --> 00:54:55.593
that was fun.

819
00:54:55.626 --> 00:54:57.294
- Another job?

820
00:54:57.328 --> 00:54:58.596
- Another bug?

821
00:54:58.629 --> 00:54:59.664
Secret camera?

822
00:55:00.798 --> 00:55:01.932
In "Breaking Bad".

823
00:55:01.966 --> 00:55:04.469
he puts that GPS
thingie by the tire.

824
00:55:04.502 --> 00:55:06.103
I can do that.

825
00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:07.605
Do you want me to put
one of those thingies

826
00:55:07.638 --> 00:55:09.106
on the Jeep's tire?

827
00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:12.943
- No. no. I don't want you
to put any thingie anywhere.

828
00:55:12.977 --> 00:55:15.613
- I just fucking tailed someone!

829
00:55:15.646 --> 00:55:17.615
This is so cool!

830
00:55:17.648 --> 00:55:20.117
So technically
speaking. what am I.

831
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:23.988
a DEA. a CI. an informant?

832
00:55:25.022 --> 00:55:26.323
- Listen. Mina.

833
00:55:28.192 --> 00:55:29.960
You did me a huge favor.

834
00:55:29.994 --> 00:55:33.330
and then you did me another
favor. and I appreciate that.

835
00:55:33.364 --> 00:55:34.799
and I owe you one.

836
00:55:34.832 --> 00:55:37.134
but there are no more jobs.

837
00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:38.669
- Fine!

838
00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:42.006
So. now what?

839
00:55:43.007 --> 00:55:43.841
Take you back?

840
00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:48.679
- How 'bout a drink?

841
00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:52.817
- I know the perfect place.

842
00:56:10.034 --> 00:56:11.669
- What's that?

843
00:56:11.702 --> 00:56:13.337
- Do you care?

844
00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:15.172
- No. I don't care.

845
00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:23.380
- So what's your story?

846
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:25.850
- My story?

847
00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:26.684
- Where did you grow up?

848
00:56:26.717 --> 00:56:27.752
- Fort Wayne. Indiana.

849
00:56:29.386 --> 00:56:30.721
Raised by my grandparents.

850
00:56:31.722 --> 00:56:32.557
- How come?

851
00:56:34.892 --> 00:56:37.394
- My mom died when I was a kid.

852
00:56:39.396 --> 00:56:42.733
My dad. he took me
to live with them.

853
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:45.202
- Sorry.

854
00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:47.071
- It was a long time ago.

855
00:56:47.104 --> 00:56:49.940
- So your dad just
left you there?

856
00:56:51.576 --> 00:56:52.409
- Yeah.

857
00:56:53.578 --> 00:56:55.880
- You don't
abandon your kid.

858
00:56:55.913 --> 00:56:57.081
You just don't.

859
00:57:01.752 --> 00:57:03.921
- When did you learn
to speak English?

860
00:57:05.089 --> 00:57:06.557
- This is Tijuana.

861
00:57:06.591 --> 00:57:07.758
Learn or starve.

862
00:57:09.093 --> 00:57:11.395
Your Spanish is not bad.

863
00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:13.063
A little chunky.

864
00:57:13.097 --> 00:57:14.765
- Chunky.
- But cute.

865
00:57:18.135 --> 00:57:20.237
- Thought I wasn't your type?

866
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:21.438
- You're not.

867
00:57:43.127 --> 00:57:44.094
- This is me.

868
00:57:44.128 --> 00:57:45.630
Thank you.

869
00:59:37.241 --> 00:59:40.544
Morning. sir.
- Mornin'.

870
00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:41.912
- Driver's license. please.

871
00:59:45.282 --> 00:59:48.753
- You're a little out of your
jurisdiction. aren't ya. son?

872
00:59:51.922 --> 00:59:53.557
Here you go.

873
00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:54.925
- Where you goin'?

874
00:59:54.959 --> 00:59:57.628
- Oh. over to the mercado.
get some groceries.

875
01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:03.934
Did I do something wrong?

876
01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:06.403
- I'm not a traffic cop.

877
01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:07.905
DEA.

878
01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:09.640
Special Agent Anthony Vanowen.

879
01:00:13.778 --> 01:00:14.945
Hi. Dad.

880
01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:18.415
- Have a seat.

881
01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:19.483
Can I get you somethin'?

882
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.453
- Yeah. I'll take
a beer. if you have any?

883
01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:24.621
- Got that.

884
01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.629
There you go.

885
01:00:45.676 --> 01:00:46.476
- What?

886
01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:50.347
- I don't know. I'm...

887
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.651
I'm just lookin'
at ya. and you...

888
01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.121
You're a man.

889
01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:57.988
You've grown up.

890
01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:00.825
You look so different.

891
01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.462
Like. how
many years has it been?

892
01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:06.330
Jesus!

893
01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:12.837
I guess I owe you
an explanation.

894
01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.206
You think so. do you?

895
01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:21.478
- You remember when you
and I drove from Cincinnati

896
01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.147
up to Chicago to see the Cubs?

897
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.314
- The day my mom died?

898
01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:26.150
Yeah. I remember that.

899
01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.853
- And that man that
killed your mom

900
01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.689
was. in fact. trying to kill me.

901
01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:36.360
- Wait.

902
01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:37.862
No.

903
01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:40.330
Wait. Why would
anyone wanna kill you?

904
01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:41.498
- The year before.

905
01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.869
I filled his hotel room
with carbon monoxide.

906
01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:50.174
and it killed his wife. his son.

907
01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:52.242
his daughter. and his father.

908
01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:55.379
Everyone.

909
01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:01.685
And he wasn't even there.

910
01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.687
He was supposed to be.
but he wasn't even there.

911
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.189
- And you told me you were...

912
01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:06.356
What was it?

913
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:07.892
An industrial lubricant
salesman. right?

914
01:02:07.925 --> 01:02:09.526
You traveled across the world

915
01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.561
all the time.
- No. my job

916
01:02:11.595 --> 01:02:15.199
was with a shadow
agency of the NSA.

917
01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:18.568
and it was my job to
execute black warrants

918
01:02:18.602 --> 01:02:20.704
and kill enemies of the state.

919
01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:25.042
- You just kill people
for a living. that's all.

920
01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:26.376
- You know. when you
put it like that.

921
01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.879
it doesn't sound so
good. but it was my job.

922
01:02:28.913 --> 01:02:29.746
- It's not great.

923
01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:33.884
- I decided it was
time to let you go.

924
01:02:33.918 --> 01:02:36.720
and I knew one
day you'd move on.

925
01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:39.890
You'd get married and
have kids of your own.

926
01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:42.392
and I would never
get to meet them.

927
01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:45.595
and that was painful for me.

928
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.934
I
got a lot of regrets.

929
01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:55.973
The one regret that I never
allowed myself to have

930
01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.143
was the decision to protect you.

931
01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:02.612
- Yeah. okay.

932
01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:07.818
- Tony?

933
01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.957
I will be here if
you wanna talk.

934
01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:16.126
- Yeah. sure.

935
01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:18.328
Yeah.

936
01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:39.649
- Tony?

937
01:03:40.985 --> 01:03:41.986
Tony. Tony?

938
01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:45.322
Take this.

939
01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.292
If you need to
talk. just call me.

940
01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:49.693
Dial direct. one.

941
01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:53.463
- Yeah. I'll call you.

942
01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:54.331
- Please.

943
01:03:59.036 --> 01:04:00.137
Hey!

944
01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:05.976
No!

945
01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:06.403
- How much longer?

946
01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:08.205
- I'd say about 24 hours.

947
01:05:13.944 --> 01:05:18.048
- Okay.

948
01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:38.102
Must be cheating on someone.

949
01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:40.237
Two phones.

950
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.105
I know.

951
01:05:42.106 --> 01:05:45.275
Let me ask you. Agent Vanowen.

952
01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.111
have we met before?

953
01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:50.580
Then what is it?

954
01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:53.583
What is it that I
did to piss you off?

955
01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:54.951
Why are you in my life?

956
01:05:56.987 --> 01:05:59.289
- How the fuck should I
know who you are. huh?

957
01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.960
- You were at my
warehouse messing around.

958
01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:06.263
Then the other night. you
tried to stop my vehicle

959
01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:08.165
after somebody tried
to assassinate me!

960
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.135
What am I to think?!

961
01:06:11.168 --> 01:06:12.602
- I don't know.

962
01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:13.937
Why don't you ask your
trigger-happy friend here?

963
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.440
He's the one that
killed my partner.

964
01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:17.307
Yeah. I see you.

965
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.949
- What happened to Polat?

966
01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:27.451
- What happened?!

967
01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:29.786
He put a bullet in his head!

968
01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.455
- That's not true.

969
01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:32.622
- I was there.

970
01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:34.491
- What did Polat tell you?

971
01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:39.963
- What is it that you want. huh?

972
01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.301
- Uh-oh.

973
01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:46.836
Yeah. I learned that from-

974
01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:53.310
Wait. does that
not mean pepperoni pizza?

975
01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:56.646
Know what?

976
01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.182
Now. I just wanna kill you.

977
01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.162
Hey. what?!

978
01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:21.838
- What is going on?

979
01:07:32.082 --> 01:07:33.550
- Fuck you!

980
01:07:36.586 --> 01:07:39.723
- They could be tracking him.

981
01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:48.398
Hello?

982
01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:53.270
It's for you.

983
01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:56.773
- Bin Farri?

984
01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.543
- Who is this?

985
01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:02.212
- Someone who
knows you very well.

986
01:08:02.246 --> 01:08:05.415
It's been over 20
years since Miami.

987
01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:07.751
- It's you.

988
01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.086
It all makes sense now.

989
01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:17.093
You used this DEA agent
as bait to find me.

990
01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:18.928
Clever.

991
01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:22.399
- Why weren't you in Miami?

992
01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:24.401
Your family was there. but no.

993
01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:26.736
you were in some hotel
with your mistress.

994
01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.738
- We all have regrets.

995
01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:31.275
- How did you find
out about my son?

996
01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:33.076
- Son?

997
01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.244
- Anthony!

998
01:08:34.278 --> 01:08:35.412
Who else?

999
01:08:35.445 --> 01:08:37.447
- Anthony Vanowen is your son?

1000
01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.916
- Let him go.

1001
01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.918
- That's not going to happen.

1002
01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:52.429
- What. big man?

1003
01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.097
- You can't kill a DEA agent.

1004
01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:55.465
- Everyone can be killed.

1005
01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:57.301
- Bring it.

1006
01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:01.271
Bring what?

1007
01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:25.795
- That door was
supposed to be locked!

1008
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:26.796
- He's the fuckin' janitor.

1009
01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:27.664
He has keys to everything.

1010
01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:29.132
It was locked.

1011
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:32.302
- What's this?

1012
01:09:32.336 --> 01:09:33.670
- I'll check
the main power.

1013
01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:35.972
- Was that you. Fernando?

1014
01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.841
- Of course not.

1015
01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:00.830
- Qué pasa?

1016
01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:13.343
- Took
you long enough.

1017
01:10:13.377 --> 01:10:15.211
- Well. I'm here now.

1018
01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:21.851
Time to go home. Son.

1019
01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:30.560
- Come on!

1020
01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:38.368
- Vámonos!

1021
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:07.897
- Captain?

1022
01:12:02.185 --> 01:12:03.453
- Is this their Wi-Fi?

1023
01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.842
- That was pretty amazing.

1024
01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:28.144
- Nah.

1025
01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.013
- That was you at
the Parallax. huh?

1026
01:12:31.548 --> 01:12:32.682
- Uh-huh.

1027
01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:34.217
- Pretty sure you
almost killed me there.

1028
01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:39.322
- You know. I was
just thinkin' about that.

1029
01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.824
- Yeah.

1030
01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.526
- And it's a good
thing you told me

1031
01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:46.362
you were with the DEA.
or otherwise. who knows?

1032
01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:50.567
- Jesus!

1033
01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.355
Oh. shit.

1034
01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:15.525
Fuck.

1035
01:13:20.564 --> 01:13:23.199
- You sleep down below.

1036
01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.400
I'll take up top.

1037
01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:26.870
Take a shower.

1038
01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:28.872
It'll probably make
you feel better.

1039
01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:31.541
- Yeah.

1040
01:13:31.575 --> 01:13:32.576
- Thanks. yeah.

1041
01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:37.581
- You said you were
at my high school.

1042
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.386
Graduation?

1043
01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.088
- Yes. I was.

1044
01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:48.091
- Was that just another
one of your lies. or what?

1045
01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.928
- No. I was there.

1046
01:13:53.463 --> 01:13:55.565
And you were with
your girlfriend.

1047
01:13:55.599 --> 01:13:56.766
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1048
01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.437
And afterwards.

1049
01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:04.574
the two of you went
out and had a pizza.

1050
01:14:04.608 --> 01:14:07.243
You were still wearing
your graduation robes

1051
01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:10.747
and looked absolutely
adorable. if I say so.

1052
01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:18.955
I was sittin' at the
table right next to you.

1053
01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:25.128
Yeah. that was the
last time I saw ya.

1054
01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:28.131
Hmm.

1055
01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:34.638
- Is that-
- Mm-mmm.

1056
01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:35.505
Yeah.

1057
01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.776
Yeah.

1058
01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:41.778
I...

1059
01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:44.848
After her burial. I moved
her out. outta there.

1060
01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.116
- Why?

1061
01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:47.951
- I don't know.

1062
01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.118
I just...

1063
01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:51.320
I didn't feel right
leavin' her behind.

1064
01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.991
and I missed her.

1065
01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:55.859
Yeah.

1066
01:14:57.694 --> 01:15:00.296
She's been there
all these years.

1067
01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.198
- Excuse me.

1068
01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:08.972
Oh. my god!

1069
01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:10.840
Mina. hi.

1070
01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:12.308
I...

1071
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.978
I really. I meant
to call. I just...

1072
01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:16.179
I was kinda tied up.

1073
01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:19.182
- Tony?

1074
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:21.685
- Hola. gringo.

1075
01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:48.678
- What?

1076
01:15:48.712 --> 01:15:50.513
Hey!
- I'm gonna kill that fucker!

1077
01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:51.681
- Tony. Tony!

1078
01:15:51.715 --> 01:15:52.849
Hey!
- No!

1079
01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:54.050
- Let the cops
take care of this one.

1080
01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:55.184
- No. I'm
gonna kill that fucker.

1081
01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:56.019
- And then what?

1082
01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:57.020
- And then Bin Farri!

1083
01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:57.854
- Oh. and then what?

1084
01:15:57.887 --> 01:15:59.355
You're a DEA agent.

1085
01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.524
- All right. fine. fuck it.

1086
01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.026
- No. no!

1087
01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:04.360
Listen to me.
- What?

1088
01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.429
- You cross that line.
you end up like me.

1089
01:16:09.733 --> 01:16:11.735
I know what I'm talkin' about.

1090
01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:49.305
- Put the gun down
or I shoot her.

1091
01:16:50.774 --> 01:16:52.575
Put the fucking gun down.

1092
01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:58.782
- All right.

1093
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.253
- And the other one.

1094
01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:13.096
- What now?

1095
01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:13.963
- Sit down.

1096
01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.633
Call him.

1097
01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:19.769
- Your boss?

1098
01:17:19.803 --> 01:17:21.270
- The old guy that got you out.

1099
01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:22.138
- Why?

1100
01:17:23.807 --> 01:17:27.443
- Call him or she's dead.
- Fuck you!

1101
01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:30.446
You and I both know you're
not gonna shoot her.

1102
01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:31.948
- I won't?

1103
01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:32.816
- No.

1104
01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:34.984
This neighborhood at this time?

1105
01:17:35.018 --> 01:17:37.286
Cops'll be swarmin'
this place in minutes.

1106
01:17:38.822 --> 01:17:41.290
- Okay.

1107
01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.660
Call him or I throw her off!

1108
01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:46.162
- Fine.

1109
01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:48.998
Now. let her go.

1110
01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.841
Hey. Dad. it's me.

1111
01:18:36.379 --> 01:18:37.213
It's okay.

1112
01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:39.849
- Where do I find him?

1113
01:18:39.883 --> 01:18:41.550
- Like I'm gonna
fuckin' tell you!

1114
01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:44.353
- Ow. fuck!

1115
01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.523
You could've just
asked me again!

1116
01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:49.525
- I'm old and I don't
have that kinda time!

1117
01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.060
- I don't fucking know!

1118
01:18:51.094 --> 01:18:52.862
All he told me was to get you!

1119
01:18:52.896 --> 01:18:54.397
- And how were you
supposed to contact him?

1120
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:55.865
- Fucking text!

1121
01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:57.366
- And what were you
supposed to say in the text?

1122
01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.567
- That I'm on my way.

1123
01:18:58.601 --> 01:19:00.870
- Text him!
- All right. all right!

1124
01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:08.544
- Give me the phone.

1125
01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.713
Give me the phone!

1126
01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:11.915
- Fuck!

1127
01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:17.420
- "Kill the agent. make Nick
watch. then bring him here."

1128
01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:19.722
"I'll give you the
million dollars."

1129
01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:21.424
Look. he shared
his location. too.

1130
01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:24.560
- A million dollars?
- A million dollars.

1131
01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:27.396
- Bin Farri has a
fucking hard-on for you.

1132
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:28.397
I don't know what you did.

1133
01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:29.732
but he wants you fuckin' dead.

1134
01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:31.734
- A million dollars.

1135
01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:33.736
I guess you didn't wanna
share that with anyone.

1136
01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:35.571
so that's why you're here alone?

1137
01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:38.741
That's pretty
industrious of you. Zico.

1138
01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:40.743
- Who fucking cares. all right?

1139
01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.611
I'm fucked!
- Maybe.

1140
01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:45.581
Maybe not.

1141
01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.951
Maybe you can help
get Bin Farri to me.

1142
01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.786
and you keep the million.

1143
01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.288
- The fuck I will.

1144
01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:54.790
Yeah fuckin' right.

1145
01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:56.092
- And then we just part ways.

1146
01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.260
and never see each other again.

1147
01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:58.461
Gentleman's agreement.

1148
01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:00.596
- No!

1149
01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.131
Fuck that!

1150
01:20:02.165 --> 01:20:04.934
I will kill him before
I let him walk away with

1151
01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:06.435
a million fuckin' dollars!
- Tony?

1152
01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:07.470
- Are you kiddin' me?

1153
01:20:07.503 --> 01:20:09.138
- Bin Farri's the target.

1154
01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.475
- You know you killed
my best friend. right?

1155
01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:13.943
For no fuckin' reason!

1156
01:20:13.977 --> 01:20:15.611
- I don't wanna
kill nobody. man!

1157
01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:18.114
I just don't wanna
go to El Hongo. man!

1158
01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:20.616
I don't
wanna go back there.

1159
01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.485
Just fucking kill me now!

1160
01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:24.453
- I mean. what the fuck
is wrong with you?!

1161
01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:27.323
Now that kid's gotta grow
up without a fucking dad

1162
01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:29.792
all because of a piece
of shit like you!

1163
01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:30.793
- Then fucking kill me!

1164
01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:33.129
- Gladly!
- No. no. no. Tony!

1165
01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:34.630
No. no. no!

1166
01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:35.798
We need him.

1167
01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:36.665
We got a deal.

1168
01:20:41.704 --> 01:20:44.140
Come on. you sorry sack of shit.

1169
01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:46.642
- Fuck that!
- Get up!

1170
01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.144
Get on your feet!

1171
01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:02.658
- There are 20 patrol
cars outside the building.

1172
01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.660
There's a bomb squad.

1173
01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:05.995
They're trying to
dismantle something

1174
01:21:06.029 --> 01:21:07.163
that looks like a bomb.

1175
01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:09.332
- It doesn't look like a bomb.

1176
01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:10.166
- What is this?

1177
01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:11.534
Why are you involved?

1178
01:21:13.236 --> 01:21:14.837
Why am I involved?

1179
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:17.840
- We will go to Dubai
tonight for the time being.

1180
01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.842
You will learn more
as I need you to.

1181
01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.011
- I'm not going anywhere.

1182
01:21:22.045 --> 01:21:23.679
- You will go where I tell you.

1183
01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:25.348
- No!

1184
01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:26.682
I live here.

1185
01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.584
And you haven't
answered my question.

1186
01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.520
Did you bring a
bomb to my building?

1187
01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:33.022
- It's not a bomb.
- What is it then?!

1188
01:21:33.056 --> 01:21:34.723
- I had a personal project!

1189
01:21:34.757 --> 01:21:36.892
- Your personal project
was to build a bomb?

1190
01:21:36.926 --> 01:21:38.727
We're not that family anymore.

1191
01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:41.030
- I needed a place to
keep a quantum device.

1192
01:21:41.064 --> 01:21:42.365
It's not a bomb.

1193
01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:44.867
That's why we needed
to upgrade the power.

1194
01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.535
- You used me?

1195
01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:48.437
- You had no problems
taking my money.

1196
01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:53.409
What?

1197
01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:55.578
- You know what?

1198
01:21:55.611 --> 01:21:56.712
Fuck this!

1199
01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:58.047
I'm not going anywhere.

1200
01:21:58.081 --> 01:21:59.215
- You agreed to do this.

1201
01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:00.049
- Not this!

1202
01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.250
I'm out!

1203
01:22:01.284 --> 01:22:04.053
The device is being
dismantled as we speak.

1204
01:22:04.087 --> 01:22:05.721
You haven't paid me!

1205
01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:06.555
Manuel is dead.

1206
01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:08.091
It's all over.

1207
01:22:08.124 --> 01:22:10.059
Your people can't keep
a train on tracks.

1208
01:22:10.093 --> 01:22:11.894
Talk about incompetent idiots.

1209
01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:14.897
- Fernando. there's no one else.

1210
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.065
You're the only
one who can do it.

1211
01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:19.102
- That was enough!

1212
01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:29.412
- What?

1213
01:22:49.132 --> 01:22:50.933
- Open the door.

1214
01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:07.283
- Get him in the back.

1215
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:09.618
- Copy.

1216
01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:10.486
- He's here.

1217
01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:24.833
Set him over there.

1218
01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:30.173
- What the hell is going on?

1219
01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.681
What is this?

1220
01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:41.650
What-

1221
01:23:41.684 --> 01:23:44.320
- Fuck!

1222
01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:45.188
Are we good?

1223
01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:47.323
Okay.

1224
01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:48.357
Can we do this now?

1225
01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:51.494
It got a little bit weird.

1226
01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:53.329
- Same account?
- No.

1227
01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:55.164
Use this one.

1228
01:23:55.198 --> 01:23:56.832
Fuck.

1229
01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:02.004
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1230
01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:02.871
- Okay.

1231
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:08.511
Wondering what's next?

1232
01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:09.378
- Nah.

1233
01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:13.216
Judgin' by that
character over there.

1234
01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:14.517
I get the idea.

1235
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:17.386
Looks like you boys
started the party early.

1236
01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:20.356
- Let me see him.

1237
01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:34.537
- Whoa. whoa. whoa!
- Ooohh!

1238
01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:39.742
- Do something!

1239
01:24:39.775 --> 01:24:42.545
- I can't.

1240
01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:43.912
I don't have any bullets.

1241
01:24:43.946 --> 01:24:45.548
- Okay. okay. okay!

1242
01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:47.750
- No!

1243
01:24:49.252 --> 01:24:50.085
Madam?

1244
01:24:52.255 --> 01:24:53.222
You need to get outta here.

1245
01:24:53.256 --> 01:24:54.223
Go home!

1246
01:24:54.257 --> 01:24:56.058
- I live here.

1247
01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:57.260
- What?

1248
01:24:57.293 --> 01:24:58.727
- Go to
the Cultural Center.

1249
01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:00.563
ask for Captain Escalante.

1250
01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:02.798
give him this address.
he'll know what to do.

1251
01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:04.733
- Go!

1252
01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:15.077
- Okay. okay.

1253
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.912
Now you tell me what you want.

1254
01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.414
A million dollars?

1255
01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:19.282
- No.

1256
01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.926
- You fucking predator!

1257
01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:32.795
Let's talk about this!

1258
01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:35.764
- No.

1259
01:25:43.306 --> 01:25:46.475
- Okay. gringo. how
do I get my money?

1260
01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:49.645
- Get a job.

1261
01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:52.981
- What?

1262
01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:29.852
- Zico?

1263
01:27:20.436 --> 01:27:21.870
- Whoa. there's a wave comin'!

1264
01:27:21.904 --> 01:27:23.205
And then another wave!

1265
01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:25.207
What are we gonna do. Captain?

1266
01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.542
What are we gonna do?

1267
01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:28.377
Oh. my god. look at that fog!

1268
01:27:28.411 --> 01:27:29.378
No. don't cry!

1269
01:27:29.412 --> 01:27:30.546
No. don't.
- You want

1270
01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:31.580
everything on it. right?

1271
01:27:31.614 --> 01:27:32.715
- Yes. yes.

1272
01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.249
Here. I'll take that.

1273
01:27:34.283 --> 01:27:35.418
- Oh. my!

1274
01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:37.920
- All right. you'll trade off.

1275
01:27:37.953 --> 01:27:39.755
- Whoo!
- Do you have a drink?

1276
01:27:39.788 --> 01:27:40.889
- Yeah. I think I do.

1277
01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:41.890
Thank you.

1278
01:27:41.924 --> 01:27:43.392
- Mina?

1279
01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:47.229
I gotta tell you.

1280
01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:49.765
this is probably the best
hamburger I've ever had.

1281
01:27:49.798 --> 01:27:51.767
You can't get a decent
hamburger in Mexico.

1282
01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.802
You just gotta rely on the taco.

1283
01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:57.072
- Thank you.

1284
01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:58.407
I'm better now.
- Aww!

1285
01:27:58.441 --> 01:27:59.575
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1286
01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:01.243
- I love this junebug.

1287
01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:02.611
Could hold him all day.

1288
01:28:03.812 --> 01:28:04.913
- You guys eat first.

1289
01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:06.248
I'm good right now.

1290
01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.950
My stomach is still
turning from the boat ride.

1291
01:28:07.983 --> 01:28:10.419
- Yeah. it was a little
choppy out there today.

1292
01:28:10.453 --> 01:28:11.286
I'm sorry.

1293
01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.588
Ah. it was lovely.

1294
01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:14.757
I'm just not used to it.
- Yeah.

1295
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:15.924
Hey!

1296
01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:17.092
I wanted to ask.

1297
01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.927
how are you settling
into the new apartment?

1298
01:28:18.961 --> 01:28:19.795
It's good?

1299
01:28:19.828 --> 01:28:21.464
- Everything is brand new.

1300
01:28:21.497 --> 01:28:23.098
- Hmm.

1301
01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.434
- We love our
little place. don't we?

1302
01:28:25.468 --> 01:28:26.935
- Do you...

1303
01:28:26.969 --> 01:28:28.103
Do you need anything else?

1304
01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.104
- We're good.

1305
01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:30.272
Thank you.

1306
01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:31.774
You've done enough.

1307
01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:35.110
I still can't get over that
whole life insurance thing.

1308
01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:35.944
- Yeah. I know. that was...

1309
01:28:35.978 --> 01:28:37.980
That was pretty odd.

1310
01:28:38.013 --> 01:28:38.947
- What happened?

1311
01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:40.449
- No.

1312
01:28:40.483 --> 01:28:41.617
My husband never told me

1313
01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:43.486
he had a million
dollar life insurance.

1314
01:28:44.687 --> 01:28:47.289
I thought I'd end up in
the streets with a baby.

1315
01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:48.991
Anthony remembered. thank god!

1316
01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:52.795
And he made them pay.

1317
01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:53.996
Can you imagine?

1318
01:28:54.997 --> 01:28:56.965
- Oh. aiy. aiy. aiy. aiy.

1319
01:28:56.999 --> 01:28:58.467
Yeah. yes. da!

1320
01:28:58.501 --> 01:28:59.802
Yessa!
- Hey!

1321
01:29:01.036 --> 01:29:01.837
- Right?
- Thanks to his daddy

1322
01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:03.472
and Uncle Tony.

1323
01:29:03.506 --> 01:29:05.641
this big guy's gonna grow up
in such a nice neighborhood

1324
01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:07.476
with lots of other kids.

1325
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:08.644
- Yep.

1326
01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:09.845
And you're gonna
go to college. too.

1327
01:29:09.878 --> 01:29:11.179
- Are you?

1328
01:29:11.213 --> 01:29:13.315
Are you gonna go to college?

1329
01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:14.316
You better.

1330
01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:16.018
- Maybe he'll go to Berkeley?

1331
01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:17.319
- Berkeley?

1332
01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:18.821
Oh. no. no. no.
not Berkeley. no.

1333
01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:21.323
He's going to Notre Dame on
a full football scholarship.

1334
01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:22.491
Mark my words.

1335
01:29:22.525 --> 01:29:23.325
Yeah.

1336
01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:24.660
- Vanowen.

1337
01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:25.861
- Look out
over your starboard bow

1338
01:29:25.894 --> 01:29:26.895
by the breaker wall.

1339
01:29:29.865 --> 01:29:31.834
There you go.

1340
01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:33.335
- Hey.

1341
01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:35.538
- I see you guys are
having a party without me?

1342
01:29:35.571 --> 01:29:37.840
Well. I'm not upset about that.

1343
01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:39.207
This isn't a social call.

1344
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:42.678
- I figured it wasn't.

1345
01:29:42.711 --> 01:29:44.379
- I need a tag-team to
carry out a black warrant

1346
01:29:44.413 --> 01:29:45.748
in San Diego right away.

1347
01:29:46.915 --> 01:29:48.183
- All right. cool.

1348
01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:49.351
- Tell the
old man I'm not upset

1349
01:29:49.384 --> 01:29:50.853
about not bein'
invited to the party.

1350
01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:52.020
- Yeah. okay.

1351
01:29:52.054 --> 01:29:52.888
Thanks.

1352
01:29:59.928 --> 01:30:00.863
- Fuckin' Frankie!

1353
01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:02.197
He's always wearin' that suit.

1354
01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.365
What's that all about?

1355
01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:04.199
- I don't know.

1356
01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:06.068
but he's got a job in San Diego.

1357
01:30:06.101 --> 01:30:07.369
Do you wanna join?

1358
01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:11.740
Yeah. count me in.

1359
01:30:15.744 --> 01:30:16.745
- All right.

1360
01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:21.216
- Yeah.

1361
01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:30.893
- Oh. lord.
