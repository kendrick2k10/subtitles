[music]

4
00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:58.320
As you all gather
under the sound of my voice today.

5
00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:06.089
I'm here to tell you that one day.
tomorrow will start without me.

6
00:01:08.503 --> 00:01:12.569
I'm also here to tell you that
as long as the good Lord blesses me

7
00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:14.927
with the air in my lungs.

8
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:19.891
I will continuously spread
his mighty word.

9
00:01:22.578 --> 00:01:24.625
I don't fear no man.

10
00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:29.152
I don't fear no organization

11
00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.524
or anyone who carries the words

12
00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.505
or ill will about someone
or something coming for me.

13
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.856
We. as a collective. have work to do.

14
00:01:42.677 --> 00:01:47.035
and that work cannot be done
while looking over our shoulders.

15
00:01:49.477 --> 00:01:55.684
sitting around. and hoping that
the same people who seek to do us harm

16
00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:58.875
will wake up
and just decide to do right by us.

17
00:02:01.228 --> 00:02:03.171
I don't know about you.

18
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.195
but I cannot effectively do
anything right

19
00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:08.804
while living in fear.

20
00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:14.635
I'm placing my trust in the Lord.

21
00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.922
I want all of us to pray
for our brothers and sisters--

22
00:02:22.362 --> 00:02:30.051
[humming]

23
00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:49.247
My boy from Troy.

24
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.162
you're sure you want
to still walk this walk with us?

25
00:03:01.971 --> 00:03:05.797
You mean to tell me
that a man of your intelligence.

26
00:03:05.943 --> 00:03:07.698
a man that [?].

27
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.376
cannot find a better word
right now than walk?

28
00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.880
[chuckles]

29
00:03:16.221 --> 00:03:19.694
What did I write and say to you
six years ago in '57?

30
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.129
I said that-

31
00:03:22.258 --> 00:03:26.983
You don't mind getting in trouble
as long as it's good trouble.

32
00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.823
[chuckles]

33
00:03:29.148 --> 00:03:30.734
And that it is.

34
00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:33.110
[sighs]

35
00:03:33.195 --> 00:03:35.030
Let me say this. my little brother.

36
00:03:36.127 --> 00:03:39.797
I for one. thought
we were going to die on that bridge.

37
00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:43.708
That nasty old Connor
setting up dogs on us

38
00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:45.223
like we weren't even human.

39
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.698
Screaming on that blowhorn
that we were disobeying a parade order.

40
00:03:50.127 --> 00:03:52.301
I actually thought
we were going to get arrested.

41
00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:00.141
You know I packed myself
two books to read.

42
00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:02.752
but once we got in that cell.

43
00:04:03.585 --> 00:04:06.649
you could [?]
an apple and an orange

44
00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:09.581
just so I can have me something to eat.

45
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.611
You and my brother A.D.
with these oranges.

46
00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:14.974
That's cause we don't [?]

47
00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:17.510
I can't argue with you on that.

48
00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:18.936
[chuckles]

49
00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:24.334
Lo and behold. I find myself
[?] side of a paddywagon.

50
00:04:25.294 --> 00:04:27.040
bagging my skull fracture.

51
00:04:28.094 --> 00:04:30.945
Brother Lewis. in my heart
I know that everything we're doing

52
00:04:31.134 --> 00:04:33.482
is so precious and so necessary.

53
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.969
and I must stand up for it
with everything in me.

54
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.592
I must speak up and speak out.

55
00:04:45.844 --> 00:04:50.235
And I will be standing. locked arms
and [?] with you every time out.

56
00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:54.752
[sighs]

57
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.908
When that governor yelled out.

58
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.983
"Troopers advance."

59
00:05:06.555 --> 00:05:12.065
I thought right where I was standing
surely was where I was going to die.

60
00:05:14.804 --> 00:05:16.607
I kept telling the police.

61
00:05:18.287 --> 00:05:21.044
"Just arrest us.
You don't have to beat us."

62
00:05:21.223 --> 00:05:22.832
We came in peace.

63
00:05:23.487 --> 00:05:26.221
I declare.
I must have said several times--

64
00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:28.672
I know I repeated it several times.

65
00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.656
"Officers. if we're doing something wrong
outside of our permit.

66
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:35.383
just arrest us."

67
00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:40.150
I'm tired. Dr. King.

68
00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:43.698
I ain't even 30 yet. and I'm tired.

69
00:05:44.428 --> 00:05:46.922
I'm tired of [?] my freedom.

70
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.465
America has failed us on its promise.

71
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:56.912
We must be free now.

72
00:05:57.176 --> 00:05:59.458
They want to give us
a taste of freedom here.

73
00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:02.202
and a sprinkle a bit over there.

74
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.967
Got folks taking literacy tests
and telling them they have to pass it

75
00:06:06.084 --> 00:06:08.602
before one can even attempt
to register to vote.

76
00:06:11.251 --> 00:06:14.451
They don't even want to acknowledge
our right to lawfully assemble.

77
00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:17.435
let alone protect us when we do.

78
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.741
Brother Lewis. where we are right now.

79
00:06:22.192 --> 00:06:24.371
I wouldn't want you
to waste any more energy

80
00:06:24.508 --> 00:06:27.096
trying to separate something
that can't be separated.

81
00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:30.644
[humming]

82
00:06:31.388 --> 00:06:32.644
Why am I here?

83
00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:36.367
Why are you here?

84
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.392
Do you really have to ask me that?

85
00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:42.084
Why are we here?

86
00:06:42.945 --> 00:06:47.265
Y'all are here to help me
in some way shape or form.

87
00:06:48.301 --> 00:06:49.637
For the third and final time.

88
00:06:49.712 --> 00:06:52.014
I am not interested
in backstabbing Dr. King.

89
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:56.240
You are very loyal
to somebody that's not loyal to you.

90
00:06:57.505 --> 00:07:00.621
Please tell me
what the fuck is wrong with you.

91
00:07:01.035 --> 00:07:04.611
I mean. are you going to stand
strong by a man

92
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:07.948
who backed away from you
on account of your lifestyle?

93
00:07:08.414 --> 00:07:13.364
The same man
who caved in to the suggestion

94
00:07:13.477 --> 00:07:16.075
that if he continues to work with you.

95
00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:20.560
the press will spread lies about
you two actually being homosexual lovers.

96
00:07:21.143 --> 00:07:25.058
even we all know that there's
only one closet in the whole room.

97
00:07:25.157 --> 00:07:27.050
and you're the only gay man in it.

98
00:07:27.218 --> 00:07:28.691
Well. you know my story.

99
00:07:30.211 --> 00:07:33.120
I'm an African-American man
fighting segregation.

100
00:07:33.397 --> 00:07:35.821
I'm an openly gay man
fighting homophobia.

101
00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:38.480
and I'm a pacifist fighting war.

102
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.978
Open. closeted.
no matter how you dress it up.

103
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.731
we all know that Dr. King
is going to be nowhere near you

104
00:07:45.802 --> 00:07:46.983
in any photographs.

105
00:07:47.148 --> 00:07:50.950
As a matter of fact. he's been told
to keep you out of sight. or else.

106
00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:53.171
And you're a key advisor at that.

107
00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:57.463
It makes one wonder.
how valuable are you?

108
00:07:57.684 --> 00:08:00.574
Russ is a great man.

109
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.028
Yes. he's a minority within a minority.

110
00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:07.868
but you'll always catch him out
on the front-line

111
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:13.515
willing to die for everything
that he speaks on [?].

112
00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:19.501
If he is so smart.
why doesn't he realize he's being used?

113
00:08:20.428 --> 00:08:21.934
Why are you doing this?

114
00:08:23.063 --> 00:08:27.063
This man decides
to live his life as so he pleases.

115
00:08:27.237 --> 00:08:32.305
However. you. Roy. Clayton.
Hoover. have decided to--

116
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.952
No. no. no. it's all right. It's all right.

117
00:08:34.051 --> 00:08:36.588
That Hoover got some nerve.
but you know what?

118
00:08:36.992 --> 00:08:38.936
I can't put all this at his feet.

119
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.682
Now. you say that you got
all these so-called negro leaders

120
00:08:42.762 --> 00:08:44.680
eating out the palm of your hand.

121
00:08:45.072 --> 00:08:46.861
but that's because they're scared.

122
00:08:47.416 --> 00:08:49.764
Scared to live any kind of free.

123
00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:51.905
Now. you can't threaten me

124
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.757
or hold anything against me
or over my head.

125
00:08:55.491 --> 00:08:57.218
Are you confused. son?

126
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:01.242
Are you clueless as to
what you want to put up first?

127
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.369
You don't know
whether you want to be out there

128
00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:08.164
just championing gay rights

129
00:09:08.277 --> 00:09:11.510
or whether you want
to keep masquerading it around

130
00:09:11.642 --> 00:09:14.032
as though you're fighting
for civil rights.

131
00:09:14.301 --> 00:09:16.762
My resume speaks for itself. sir.

132
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.442
that I will always fight for the rights
of my fellow civil rights leaders.

133
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:23.025
I will oppose
the Southern segregationists

134
00:09:23.115 --> 00:09:25.242
who don't like
the whole civil rights thing.

135
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.240
my white agent friend.

136
00:09:27.797 --> 00:09:31.952
and as long as I live. I will oppose
the Northern liberals who are--

137
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.717
What did you say? They were looking
for a more cautious approach?

138
00:09:36.748 --> 00:09:41.341
[claps]
We all know exactly what you do.

139
00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:45.971
We also know that you will always be
relegated to the background.

140
00:09:47.623 --> 00:09:52.296
I want to thank you. though.
for toning down that Lewis speech

141
00:09:52.649 --> 00:09:56.531
away from the militant direction
that he was planning on going.

142
00:09:56.701 --> 00:10:01.077
You know. these wiretaps.
they keep us up at night.

143
00:10:01.181 --> 00:10:04.847
but they keep us on our toes
and up to speed big time.

144
00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:06.141
[chuckles]

145
00:10:06.249 --> 00:10:09.623
This man played a major part

146
00:10:09.708 --> 00:10:11.665
in orchestrating
the I Have A Dream speech.

147
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:19.957
This man played a major role
in organizing the buses to D.C..

148
00:10:20.065 --> 00:10:23.840
while making sure marchers had
adequate bathroom facilities

149
00:10:23.934 --> 00:10:25.722
and medical care if needed.

150
00:10:26.338 --> 00:10:31.430
Now. as you say.
you hear him on your wiretaps.

151
00:10:31.435 --> 00:10:37.148
I'm sure you do. then you know that
he's not out here trying to hurt anybody.

152
00:10:39.727 --> 00:10:41.129
[sighs]

153
00:10:41.355 --> 00:10:44.997
This man did this. and this man did that.

154
00:10:45.105 --> 00:10:47.920
and this man helped start the SCLC.

155
00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:50.884
and this man did
blah. blah. blah. blah. blah.

156
00:10:51.134 --> 00:10:55.567
All we know that is this man ain't
in the long-term plans of the team.

157
00:10:57.035 --> 00:10:58.715
You know what?
You're just wasting our time

158
00:10:58.809 --> 00:11:01.312
with these divisive tactics and thoughts.

159
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.924
I know my role and I know my worth.

160
00:11:04.611 --> 00:11:07.138
What has any of that gotten you?

161
00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:09.562
It's about to get
the shit smacked out of you.

162
00:11:09.637 --> 00:11:11.105
Look here. look here.

163
00:11:11.228 --> 00:11:14.080
The man's own assistant
doesn't even practice non-violence.

164
00:11:14.484 --> 00:11:17.670
Ever hear anything like that
on your wiretaps [?]?

165
00:11:17.788 --> 00:11:20.992
Clyde. do not try me
because I'm not that far removed.

166
00:11:21.195 --> 00:11:22.569
Bottom-line. I can't help you.

167
00:11:22.654 --> 00:11:24.056
And he never will.

168
00:11:25.948 --> 00:11:27.463
Stay your course. Russ.

169
00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:31.176
You are fighting a good fight.
my brother.

170
00:11:31.872 --> 00:11:36.174
and what they're doing. it ain't it.

171
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.550
Miss Lorraine. do you realize
what kind of shit we got on tape

172
00:11:42.644 --> 00:11:44.385
on this negro gentleman?

173
00:11:44.489 --> 00:11:46.988
Pardon my French. but fuck your tapes.

174
00:11:47.609 --> 00:11:50.960
Just because you say you have something
doesn't mean you really have it.

175
00:11:51.331 --> 00:11:55.016
All this pressure you're applying.
believe you me.

176
00:11:55.312 --> 00:11:57.185
it is nothing we haven't seen before.

177
00:11:57.995 --> 00:11:59.298
Oh. really?

178
00:11:59.397 --> 00:12:00.762
Yes. really.

179
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.176
You say you listen in on everybody.

180
00:12:05.472 --> 00:12:08.225
but yet you had the nerve
to hire a black sister

181
00:12:08.343 --> 00:12:10.781
to file a bogus report

182
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.150
about being raped in a room
while Martin just sat there watching.

183
00:12:16.644 --> 00:12:22.103
Just another sign of how stupid
and desperate you all are.

184
00:12:22.465 --> 00:12:25.792
How is a bunch of FBI agents
going to sit in a room next door

185
00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:29.011
and listen to a rape in progress?

186
00:12:29.129 --> 00:12:30.522
You know what?

187
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.183
That would be a crime onto itself.

188
00:12:32.263 --> 00:12:33.543
It certainly would.

189
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.741
Now. if you two ain't going to come right.
then don't come at all.

190
00:12:38.409 --> 00:12:39.868
What y'all say?

191
00:12:40.145 --> 00:12:41.642
You know what I say about that?

192
00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:43.952
I'll tell you what I got to say about that.

193
00:12:44.127 --> 00:12:48.357
I'll say I got something on the both of y'all
that'll make you change your minds.

194
00:12:48.955 --> 00:12:51.025
Now we're getting somewhere.

195
00:12:54.785 --> 00:12:58.889
Make sure you verbally tell him
to pull back on [?].

196
00:12:59.298 --> 00:13:03.736
So you all can focus
on some alleged extramarital affairs?

197
00:13:04.611 --> 00:13:06.282
Little [?] caved in. huh?

198
00:13:06.376 --> 00:13:07.924
Just do as you're told.

199
00:13:15.952 --> 00:15:25.317
[music]

200
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.470
So you're my handler. huh?

201
00:15:29.411 --> 00:15:32.244
White motherfuckers sure know
how to distance themselves.

202
00:15:32.847 --> 00:15:36.051
Your lady. she's doing too much
at her church.

203
00:15:36.207 --> 00:15:37.651
We need you to tone her down.

204
00:15:38.268 --> 00:15:40.489
She's not really the type
to be quiet like that.

205
00:15:40.597 --> 00:15:45.242
Well. the way that [?] people.
she needs to be given a shot.

206
00:15:45.835 --> 00:15:47.044
Excuse me?

207
00:15:47.275 --> 00:15:51.510
Look. I know what you're capable of.
and that's why I'm here.

208
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.917
Don't ever expect to see my face again.

209
00:15:56.362 --> 00:15:58.545
The people you need
are all in that folder

210
00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:00.527
and they will be in contact.

211
00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:05.924
and fall back off the [?].

212
00:16:12.527 --> 00:16:16.894
I done told you.
I don't want no blood on my hands.

213
00:16:17.138 --> 00:16:21.581
Now we done told you that it's too late
not to have blood on your hands.

214
00:16:22.197 --> 00:16:27.068
Now. your friend.
or should I say your leader.

215
00:16:27.717 --> 00:16:32.000
he's going to be expiring
very. very soon as I see it.

216
00:16:33.505 --> 00:16:35.044
And we thank you.

217
00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:37.905
You know.
you've put yourself in a position

218
00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:41.397
where you might have yourself
a front-row seat.

219
00:16:41.783 --> 00:16:45.016
and might be standing right next to him
when it all happens.

220
00:16:46.738 --> 00:16:48.390
I don't want this blood money.

221
00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:53.063
You want to know what's the best thing
we can do for you right now?

222
00:16:53.228 --> 00:16:54.508
I'm listening.

223
00:16:54.668 --> 00:16:58.964
The best thing we can do for your ass
is have our guys not shoot you too.

224
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.480
I might go to the local cops with this.

225
00:17:02.884 --> 00:17:03.990
Yes. you just do that.

226
00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.028
Would you like me to tell you
who to ask for?

227
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.343
No. this shit has got to prove something.

228
00:17:08.503 --> 00:17:12.922
Nigga. there are more people out
to quiet King than you think.

229
00:17:13.755 --> 00:17:17.576
The people at the police precinct.
they're tired of all this shit.

230
00:17:18.254 --> 00:17:21.482
and those brothers at the--

231
00:17:21.647 --> 00:17:24.508
Among the common folk at the SCLC.

232
00:17:24.762 --> 00:17:28.597
they're just dying to get on line
and take his spot.

233
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.637
We have people such as yourself

234
00:17:31.741 --> 00:17:36.145
that we could just wave a few dollars
in their face and then. boom.

235
00:17:37.628 --> 00:17:42.075
Oh. looks like we got ourselves
a co-conspirator.

236
00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:48.244
[humming]

237
00:18:01.656 --> 00:18:02.992
Thank you.

238
00:18:03.077 --> 00:18:04.192
You're welcome.

239
00:18:12.352 --> 00:18:13.924
They're coming for you. Martin.

240
00:18:17.609 --> 00:18:20.098
I am so sorry
that God put this mission on you.

241
00:18:22.997 --> 00:18:24.607
A few of us--

242
00:18:24.889 --> 00:18:28.174
A group of us have been approached
by the FBI. and I--

243
00:18:28.272 --> 00:18:32.592
Lady Lorraine.
I refuse to live my life in fear.

244
00:18:33.651 --> 00:18:35.825
My fight for justice and equality--

245
00:18:35.915 --> 00:18:39.938
Martin. the people that you're fighting
aren't fighting you clean.

246
00:18:42.583 --> 00:18:45.750
Tell me what part of that you don't get?

247
00:18:45.863 --> 00:18:48.800
I'm not concerned about
the power of those I'm fighting.

248
00:18:49.218 --> 00:18:52.141
I'm more concerned
with my people and the liberties--

249
00:18:52.202 --> 00:18:53.388
Their liberties?

250
00:18:54.112 --> 00:18:55.670
Their liberties. Martin?

251
00:18:57.858 --> 00:19:01.976
Will you be alive
to see those liberties utilized?

252
00:19:03.505 --> 00:19:06.574
They are trying to infiltrate
to your friends.

253
00:19:06.894 --> 00:19:10.315
It was one of your friends
that sent that package to Coretta.

254
00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:14.785
common folk sitting amongst us in church

255
00:19:16.338 --> 00:19:17.477
pretending to worship.

256
00:19:17.562 --> 00:19:20.320
I refuse to fight
and go to the depths of shame

257
00:19:20.428 --> 00:19:21.924
that Director Hoover has chosen.

258
00:19:22.004 --> 00:19:23.816
While Hoover spares
no course to break you?

259
00:19:24.042 --> 00:19:27.948
Telling all the press that you're
some lying negro ass preacher?

260
00:19:30.748 --> 00:19:35.872
Lady Lorraine.
when we do as our enemies do to us

261
00:19:36.451 --> 00:19:39.345
and we decide to fight for an eye--

262
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.155
I wish you would stop
making everything a goddamn speech

263
00:19:42.235 --> 00:19:45.651
and deal with these people on the level
that they need to be dealt with.

264
00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:50.800
Can I talk to my friend right now?

265
00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.771
I am your friend.

266
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.783
Don't go near that window. Martin.

267
00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:12.028
Someone close to you
is playing both sides of the fence.

268
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.131
Now. I can't say anything now.

269
00:20:21.487 --> 00:20:25.411
but I feel uneasy about
that photographer that you have on staff.

270
00:20:25.698 --> 00:20:29.854
Yes. he's new to the town.
but his background checked out.

271
00:20:30.884 --> 00:20:32.983
He's also a cousin of Sister Martha.

272
00:20:36.884 --> 00:20:41.223
Well. from what I'm hearing. whoever it is.

273
00:20:42.272 --> 00:20:47.562
they're being instructed to not wear
a necktie to certain speaking engagements.

274
00:20:53.072 --> 00:20:56.018
I'm praying you'll be careful
around these sources you have.

275
00:20:56.503 --> 00:20:58.847
They keep approaching you for a reason.

276
00:20:59.105 --> 00:21:00.823
which could only mean

277
00:21:01.783 --> 00:21:04.437
they have something in sight for you
that won't end well.

278
00:21:13.091 --> 00:21:14.480
I can't take this.

279
00:21:14.804 --> 00:21:18.527
That damn Agent Fisher.
he followed me here this morning.

280
00:21:18.724 --> 00:21:20.000
What?

281
00:21:20.098 --> 00:21:24.000
Girl. he wants to know how we doing
with poisoning the Reverend.

282
00:21:24.536 --> 00:21:26.771
He even had the nerve to grab my arm.

283
00:21:26.842 --> 00:21:27.811
What?

284
00:21:27.896 --> 00:21:31.924
You know him and that other one.
they sit outside our place every night.

285
00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:34.997
They do that same thing to me.

286
00:21:35.496 --> 00:21:38.898
My husband had to call the cops
on them a few times.

287
00:21:39.058 --> 00:21:41.882
Sitting in their car
shining their light through the house.

288
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.167
What? [?]. did the cops come by you?

289
00:21:45.374 --> 00:21:48.320
Yes. ain't do nothing.

290
00:21:48.456 --> 00:21:51.816
Said them men ain't breaking no laws
in that car.

291
00:21:52.098 --> 00:21:54.983
and have all rights to sit there at that.

292
00:21:55.077 --> 00:21:56.475
That's cause they're white folks.

293
00:21:56.536 --> 00:21:58.263
They can't come in here and blend in.

294
00:21:58.367 --> 00:22:00.696
so they got to send us in there
to do their dirty work.

295
00:22:00.781 --> 00:22:03.840
You know what?
I'm scared for Reverend King.

296
00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:05.595
I'm really scared for him.

297
00:22:05.698 --> 00:22:09.463
These white folks. they have the power

298
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.691
to come in here
and find somebody to harm us.

299
00:22:12.856 --> 00:22:16.089
They're really unpredictable.
these white folk.

300
00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:20.428
You know. Mother Alberta.
that's her biggest fear.

301
00:22:20.809 --> 00:22:23.680
That one day.
someone's going to walk in here

302
00:22:24.145 --> 00:22:27.524
and just start shooting worshipers.

303
00:22:27.821 --> 00:22:29.637
It's a scary time I'll tell you.

304
00:22:29.722 --> 00:22:33.731
A scary time that you can't even feel safe
in the house of the Lord.

305
00:22:33.854 --> 00:22:38.418
I've been trying to get to the Reverend
through Deacon Clyde

306
00:22:39.025 --> 00:22:41.971
that I need to meet with him
as soon as possible.

307
00:22:42.536 --> 00:22:45.468
Well. we can't stop praying for him.

308
00:22:46.357 --> 00:22:51.261
Sister Florence. I'm here.
and I'm tired of praying.

309
00:22:51.388 --> 00:22:52.917
I want to do some fighting.

310
00:22:53.044 --> 00:22:54.343
You understand?

311
00:22:54.442 --> 00:22:58.108
I want to hurt
some of them whites so bad.

312
00:22:58.324 --> 00:22:59.628
Let me tell you something.

313
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:05.651
God ain't intend for us
to be [?] and bitten by dogs.

314
00:23:05.736 --> 00:23:06.912
You understand?

315
00:23:06.997 --> 00:23:08.640
That's not the way. Virginia.

316
00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:13.402
We have to be mindful
that we have children to raise.

317
00:23:13.505 --> 00:23:14.955
And this not what God wants.

318
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.527
Now hold on now.
they [?] to kill our children.

319
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.218
so what are we waiting for to respond?

320
00:23:21.557 --> 00:23:24.418
The Reverend does not preach violence.

321
00:23:24.682 --> 00:23:27.021
Well. what we going to do?

322
00:23:27.242 --> 00:23:30.804
We're going to keep marching.
we're going to keep protesting.

323
00:23:30.931 --> 00:23:33.261
and we're just going to wait our turn
so we can die?

324
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.795
Huh. Martha? Tell me.

325
00:23:34.894 --> 00:23:37.567
Did you see what happened to Malcolm?

326
00:23:38.225 --> 00:23:41.350
Where's the help
for Betty and them children?

327
00:23:41.482 --> 00:23:42.517
Now. hold on.

328
00:23:42.663 --> 00:23:43.760
Yes. I see what happened.

329
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.974
and also see what happened
to my two cousins

330
00:23:47.068 --> 00:23:48.480
and those three little girls

331
00:23:48.583 --> 00:23:51.595
down at 16th Street Baptist Church
five years ago.

332
00:23:51.689 --> 00:23:52.992
I seen it.

333
00:23:53.096 --> 00:23:58.070
Look. we're going to protest peacefully
until things are better.

334
00:23:58.564 --> 00:24:00.094
Peacefully?

335
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.931
We can't even come to the church in peace.

336
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.030
You just said this morning

337
00:24:05.435 --> 00:24:07.035
that they followed you [crosstalk]--

338
00:24:07.148 --> 00:24:08.310
No. hold on.

339
00:24:08.409 --> 00:24:10.150
You just said that they followed you.

340
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.567
You let me know.
is that bruise on your arm there

341
00:24:13.891 --> 00:24:15.477
intended to be put there?

342
00:24:15.552 --> 00:24:17.091
Don't you question my God.

343
00:24:17.195 --> 00:24:18.776
Now. hold on. sister--

344
00:24:18.875 --> 00:24:19.910
Ladies. ladies--

345
00:24:19.995 --> 00:24:23.162
Oh. no. no.
I'm questioning everybody but God.

346
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.571
Ladies. this is exactly what they want.

347
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.136
They want us divided.

348
00:24:30.338 --> 00:24:32.437
They want us fighting each other.

349
00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:36.207
We need to pull it together
cause we can't win like this.

350
00:24:36.456 --> 00:24:37.891
We got to pull it together

351
00:24:38.131 --> 00:24:42.315
so we'll know who's with us
and who is not.

352
00:24:42.837 --> 00:24:45.891
Well. people can't be with you
if their needs are different.

353
00:24:46.032 --> 00:24:48.028
Let's get back to this later.

354
00:24:48.498 --> 00:24:51.741
Right now. let's focus on the man--

355
00:24:51.849 --> 00:24:54.752
Protecting the man of God.

356
00:24:54.955 --> 00:24:58.752
Regardless of how
you two want to move forward.

357
00:24:59.825 --> 00:25:02.625
they are coming for the King.

358
00:25:02.814 --> 00:25:23.355
[music]

359
00:25:23.868 --> 00:25:25.600
My lady showed me her arm.

360
00:25:26.423 --> 00:25:28.903
Well. you weren't moving
fast enough for me.

361
00:25:29.214 --> 00:25:31.868
so I had to take some action
to get your attention.

362
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.367
We both know I'm not a big fan
of this Martin guy. right?

363
00:25:37.976 --> 00:25:40.451
I think that's the highlight
of your recruitment

364
00:25:40.545 --> 00:25:42.450
and your jacket. Beaumont.

365
00:25:42.767 --> 00:25:46.884
The same jacket will tell you
that I don't mind spending

366
00:25:47.171 --> 00:25:52.065
a day. or weeks. or even years in jail.

367
00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:56.028
Is that right. Agent Coleman?

368
00:25:58.842 --> 00:26:02.362
Is what I'm asking you correct.
Agent Coleman?

369
00:26:02.531 --> 00:26:04.192
Sounds about right to me.

370
00:26:04.621 --> 00:26:06.752
Okay. great.

371
00:26:08.988 --> 00:26:10.715
With that being said.

372
00:26:10.992 --> 00:26:14.258
don't you ever put
your pale fucking hands

373
00:26:14.475 --> 00:26:15.990
on my lady again.

374
00:26:16.423 --> 00:26:18.352
You know what I'm good at.

375
00:26:18.912 --> 00:26:22.258
I can make your death
look just like a suicide.

376
00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:23.924
All right.

377
00:26:24.305 --> 00:26:25.985
Family's off-limits.

378
00:26:26.174 --> 00:26:29.058
From this moment on.
family is off-limits.

379
00:26:29.152 --> 00:26:32.225
Don't try satisfying
my fucking ears right now.

380
00:26:32.367 --> 00:26:34.734
You motherfuckers have no conscience.

381
00:26:35.218 --> 00:26:37.496
Family should have always been off-limits.

382
00:26:38.061 --> 00:26:40.032
and why the fuck
are y'all calling that man's house

383
00:26:40.136 --> 00:26:41.647
threatening his wife and kids?

384
00:26:42.112 --> 00:26:43.576
Why the fuck do you care?

385
00:26:43.689 --> 00:26:46.018
Since when a man
that we hired to work hand-in-hand

386
00:26:46.112 --> 00:26:48.056
with selected mafia associates.

387
00:26:48.254 --> 00:26:53.021
only to target wanted KKK members.
develop a soft spot?

388
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.522
They made it very clear down in Jackson.
they weren't coming back with us alive.

389
00:26:58.734 --> 00:27:01.364
And y'all decided
not to leave any witnesses

390
00:27:01.477 --> 00:27:02.724
with these incidents. right?

391
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.602
Not me. I have a code.

392
00:27:05.416 --> 00:27:06.781
And we have an assignment.

393
00:27:06.894 --> 00:27:08.047
You and I. we have a duty.

394
00:27:08.117 --> 00:27:09.298
We owe America.

395
00:27:09.477 --> 00:27:10.762
Fuck America.

396
00:27:11.689 --> 00:27:13.680
I don't owe your America shit.

397
00:27:14.122 --> 00:27:17.821
America's been spitting up blood
since the day it was established.

398
00:27:18.032 --> 00:27:21.294
Look at the palm of your hands
and look at the bottom of your boots.

399
00:27:21.703 --> 00:27:24.720
because some of that blood
has been spilled by men like you

400
00:27:24.785 --> 00:27:26.089
and men like me.

401
00:27:26.941 --> 00:27:29.327
Motherfucker. we are not the same.

402
00:27:29.477 --> 00:27:31.378
Oh. yes. the fuck we are.

403
00:27:31.585 --> 00:27:33.110
The only difference between you and me

404
00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:36.112
is people see a killer
the moment they set eyes your way.

405
00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:40.950
You're a perp. nothing but a crime
looking for somewhere to happen.

406
00:27:41.896 --> 00:27:44.268
Fuck you and your thoughts.

407
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.538
Look. that's the way it is.
I don't make this shit up.

408
00:27:48.381 --> 00:27:51.374
But you're knee-deep in an assignment
to kill a man

409
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.221
who only wants an even playing ground

410
00:27:54.352 --> 00:27:57.694
for his kids. for his family. and for--

411
00:27:57.783 --> 00:27:59.510
I just see myself

412
00:27:59.835 --> 00:28:03.185
working against any agenda
that allows for coloreds uniting.

413
00:28:04.145 --> 00:28:06.268
You'll never understand
the threat it poses.

414
00:28:06.376 --> 00:28:08.894
Ain't no black messiahs
coming up on my watch.

415
00:28:09.444 --> 00:28:12.800
Now. you just stay in your place
and work on surviving all this.

416
00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:17.651
You know. you should work
on surviving this. too.

417
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:21.261
cause I know my way
through the suburbs.

418
00:28:21.802 --> 00:28:26.795
I can definitely knock
on your front door in Pine Valley.

419
00:28:29.312 --> 00:28:30.400
You know what?

420
00:28:30.696 --> 00:28:31.924
Scratch that.

421
00:28:32.263 --> 00:28:34.065
I don't really do front doors.

422
00:28:34.785 --> 00:28:39.077
My skin type is not allowed in the front
of any white-owned properties.

423
00:28:40.089 --> 00:28:43.948
Yes. motherfucker.
I know your jacket too.

424
00:28:44.094 --> 00:28:44.983
Beaumont--

425
00:28:45.068 --> 00:28:46.475
Yes. motherfucker.

426
00:28:46.785 --> 00:28:51.491
I know where you lay your head just like
you occasionally know where I lay mine.

427
00:28:51.623 --> 00:28:54.197
I'll kill you if you come near my family.

428
00:28:55.044 --> 00:28:57.764
You're going to have to
if you come near my lady

429
00:28:57.868 --> 00:29:00.037
or go to her church again without me.

430
00:29:00.752 --> 00:29:02.272
Fuck around if you want.

431
00:29:02.658 --> 00:29:07.807
I'll show you that my lady is
the only black life that matters to me.

432
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.058
[cocks shotgun]

433
00:29:11.218 --> 00:29:30.254
[music]

434
00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.632
Daddy. daddy. daddy. I picked this one.

435
00:29:33.727 --> 00:29:35.120
Can you [?]?

436
00:29:36.254 --> 00:29:38.574
Whoa. does your mother know
you've been in our closet?

437
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:39.948
No. sir. She does not.

438
00:29:40.042 --> 00:29:41.115
[chuckles]

439
00:29:41.237 --> 00:29:44.592
You'll get us both in trouble
bringing this shirt down here like this.

440
00:29:44.691 --> 00:29:47.105
How? The other ones are wrinkled. too.

441
00:29:47.247 --> 00:29:51.604
[laughs] Come here. son.

442
00:29:51.717 --> 00:29:54.588
You tell your mother
I'll be down there shortly.

443
00:29:54.974 --> 00:29:58.009
And that you're not wearing
the one she had ironed?

444
00:29:58.188 --> 00:30:00.983
Just tell your mother
I'll be down there shortly. son.

445
00:30:03.181 --> 00:30:03.760
[?]

446
00:30:03.849 --> 00:30:06.762
I know. I'll understand when I'm older.

447
00:30:15.529 --> 00:30:21.407
Your family.
Coretta is raising them children so well.

448
00:30:21.807 --> 00:30:23.915
I don't know what I'd do without her.

449
00:30:27.567 --> 00:30:31.247
Dr. King. I feel like I'm dead already.

450
00:30:32.141 --> 00:30:34.522
I can imagine that feeling hurts.

451
00:30:35.392 --> 00:30:37.920
just as much as my feeling of loneliness.

452
00:30:40.564 --> 00:30:43.435
I tell you. I look around sometimes.

453
00:30:44.089 --> 00:30:46.400
it seems like everything
is backing away from me.

454
00:30:47.849 --> 00:30:52.931
Everyone and everything seems so distant.

455
00:30:53.232 --> 00:30:55.242
so out of my reach.

456
00:31:00.061 --> 00:31:02.842
It's like I'm trying so desperately

457
00:31:03.016 --> 00:31:05.477
to reach back and pull my people up.

458
00:31:06.517 --> 00:31:12.649
and at the same time trying to reach up
with my free hand and touch the heavens.

459
00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:21.614
You can't look forward and backward
at the same time.

460
00:31:22.734 --> 00:31:28.192
I say. trust your heart
and trust what you are seeing.

461
00:31:30.658 --> 00:31:33.021
because the God that we serve.

462
00:31:33.595 --> 00:31:40.898
death is small in comparison to [?].

463
00:31:43.538 --> 00:31:45.232
I just pray it's glory.

464
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.047
I just pray it's glory.

465
00:31:52.164 --> 00:31:56.272
[humming]

466
00:31:58.837 --> 00:32:02.230
You will do what we need you to do.

467
00:32:02.569 --> 00:32:05.002
You gave up all your rights
when you decided--

468
00:32:05.101 --> 00:32:08.145
Fisher. Fisher. we need him.
we can't lose him this way.

469
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:12.028
Trust me. he doesn't talk to me
that much after services.

470
00:32:13.035 --> 00:32:14.527
Trust you?

471
00:32:14.649 --> 00:32:16.752
[chuckles] Trust you?

472
00:32:16.978 --> 00:32:19.938
Yes. that's what I need you to do. trust me.

473
00:32:20.084 --> 00:32:22.729
He made you a deacon at his church.

474
00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:26.851
how come you are not as willing
to die for him as he is willing to die for you?

475
00:32:27.237 --> 00:32:28.748
Here's how you make it up to us.

476
00:32:28.823 --> 00:32:32.225
Look. I don't want to kill anybody.
and I don't want to see anybody hurt.

477
00:32:32.367 --> 00:32:34.432
You don't have to hurt nobody.

478
00:32:34.602 --> 00:32:39.232
All you have to do is tell him
to do us a big favor and just kill himself.

479
00:32:39.374 --> 00:32:41.684
Then that will be
the only embarrassing thing

480
00:32:41.764 --> 00:32:43.115
the world will ever know.

481
00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.861
Who am I supposed to tell them
that this request is coming from?

482
00:32:47.251 --> 00:32:48.536
We don't care.

483
00:32:48.611 --> 00:32:51.044
[?]. you can sort that out on your own.

484
00:32:51.327 --> 00:32:52.583
Just get it done.

485
00:32:52.743 --> 00:32:54.574
Then upon his death.

486
00:32:54.964 --> 00:33:00.249
we will toss an extra $200
in your direction for all your troubles.

487
00:33:01.505 --> 00:33:03.256
I'll see what I can do.

488
00:33:03.618 --> 00:33:07.520
I know. or we know that you see.

489
00:33:07.868 --> 00:33:10.418
As of now. we need you to do.

490
00:33:11.237 --> 00:33:13.807
The doors of the church are now open.

491
00:33:14.536 --> 00:33:16.400
You guys are going to get yours.

492
00:33:16.889 --> 00:33:19.482
The same vengeance
that God has in store for me.

493
00:33:19.665 --> 00:33:21.567
he has it in store for you also.

494
00:33:21.948 --> 00:33:23.129
You know what?

495
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.044
You get on home now. you hear?

496
00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:28.117
You got church tomorrow.

497
00:33:29.007 --> 00:33:34.861
and we don't want you to be late
for the Lord on our account. you hear?

498
00:33:40.517 --> 00:33:41.995
Sister Virginia?

499
00:33:42.489 --> 00:33:44.541
Hello Reverend. how are you?

500
00:33:44.696 --> 00:33:46.423
I'm doing just fine.

501
00:33:48.668 --> 00:33:50.023
How did you like the service?

502
00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.171
Well. I loved it.

503
00:33:51.261 --> 00:33:52.823
If you didn't. would you tell me?

504
00:33:52.941 --> 00:33:54.155
No. Reverend.

505
00:33:54.404 --> 00:33:58.395
I know. I know. if anybody
was going to tell me. it would be you.

506
00:33:58.936 --> 00:34:02.710
Yes. you got to trust and believe
what God tells you.

507
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.844
Yes.

508
00:34:03.929 --> 00:34:05.844
I've been meaning to ask you something--

509
00:34:06.588 --> 00:34:08.320
Come on now.
that's what I've been waiting for.

510
00:34:08.418 --> 00:34:09.444
Come on now.

511
00:34:09.557 --> 00:34:11.360
[laughs] No now. Sister Virginia.

512
00:34:11.811 --> 00:34:13.976
you know we practice
that non-violence over here.

513
00:34:14.602 --> 00:34:15.350
[laughs]

514
00:34:15.444 --> 00:34:17.120
My apologies. Reverend.

515
00:34:17.595 --> 00:34:19.854
You know God is still working on me.

516
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.322
I must say. [?] beginning
where we're at sometimes--

517
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.776
No worries. but I have to ask you.

518
00:34:27.378 --> 00:34:31.157
why do you keep your fist balled up
for the entire service?

519
00:34:33.124 --> 00:34:35.105
Oh. you caught that. huh?

520
00:34:36.028 --> 00:34:37.388
Every Sunday.

521
00:34:37.496 --> 00:34:41.185
Whether my father's preaching.
or if I finally get the chance to preach.

522
00:34:41.967 --> 00:34:46.621
I can see from the pulpit to the back door
you rubbing your knuckles together.

523
00:34:47.077 --> 00:34:50.861
Well. Reverend do you want
the 'we're still in the sanctuary answer'

524
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:52.616
or do you want me
to give you my answer?

525
00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.315
Because I can tell you--

526
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:57.049
Never mind. never mind.

527
00:34:57.962 --> 00:35:00.856
[sighs] I just thought it was funny.

528
00:35:03.129 --> 00:35:05.011
I love you. Sister Virginia.

529
00:35:06.169 --> 00:35:09.435
I love you too. Reverend.
but before you go.

530
00:35:10.409 --> 00:35:13.463
I have something on my spirit
and I need to get it off.

531
00:35:13.924 --> 00:35:20.080
I'm just not doing too good
with this non-violent stuff. Reverend.

532
00:35:20.207 --> 00:35:25.618
The church [?] and I just feel like

533
00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.795
all I know how to do
is use these to fight.

534
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:33.882
I've been fighting off men my whole life.

535
00:35:34.804 --> 00:35:37.581
I really don't think
I'd want to be out there

536
00:35:37.821 --> 00:35:39.675
with this non-violent protest.

537
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.783
I'm no good.
I shouldn't be out there.

538
00:35:45.397 --> 00:35:46.550
I see.

539
00:35:47.557 --> 00:35:49.284
Well. do you have a license?

540
00:35:50.004 --> 00:35:51.623
No sir. I don't.

541
00:35:52.282 --> 00:35:54.023
Well. I'm going to have to scratch that.

542
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.917
I just figured
if was going to get into a tussle.

543
00:35:57.741 --> 00:36:02.211
maybe you could drive the getaway car.
but you ain't got no license.

544
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.400
[laughs]

545
00:36:04.541 --> 00:36:07.063
Now. look here. Reverend.
I ain't got no license.

546
00:36:07.312 --> 00:36:10.230
but ain't said nothing
about I don't know how to drive.

547
00:36:10.329 --> 00:36:12.531
Now. I can do that.

548
00:36:14.508 --> 00:36:16.352
Pastor. can I bend your ear
for a second?

549
00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:18.381
Yes. talk to me.

550
00:36:18.804 --> 00:36:20.611
Is there somewhere
we can talk in private?

551
00:36:20.705 --> 00:36:24.240
If this can wait about two hours.
we can use my study office.

552
00:36:24.385 --> 00:36:27.115
Because right now. I have a meeting
with some of the core leaders

553
00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.510
and leaders of the NAACP.

554
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:33.581
I got to leave in about 20 minutes.
so I guess we can do our talk here.

555
00:36:36.941 --> 00:36:40.390
I think you want to seriously consider
getting rid of Russ.

556
00:36:41.312 --> 00:36:44.254
Deacon Clyde. not this again.

557
00:36:45.538 --> 00:36:47.171
Look. let me go and get--

558
00:36:47.364 --> 00:36:50.720
Pastor. you're talking
about losing everything. life or death.

559
00:36:50.823 --> 00:36:52.814
Losing everything we've built so far.

560
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:59.087
Look. me and you
have been to the sandbox.

561
00:36:59.501 --> 00:37:03.190
so I'm going to say it again.
Russ is a good man.

562
00:37:03.435 --> 00:37:05.444
Russ is a gay man.

563
00:37:06.112 --> 00:37:09.369
What he's all about
is going to destroy the movement.

564
00:37:09.468 --> 00:37:10.762
and you know that.

565
00:37:10.912 --> 00:37:14.423
His sissy lifestyle is not conducive
to what we are trying to accomplish.

566
00:37:14.508 --> 00:37:16.560
I'm not going to debate this
with you. my brother.

567
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:20.108
All the things that you were involved in
and that you left behind.

568
00:37:20.291 --> 00:37:22.960
no man or woman can walk
into this church leadership building

569
00:37:23.049 --> 00:37:25.162
and tell me to cut you off
because of it.

570
00:37:25.369 --> 00:37:27.317
What do you think
they're here to tell you?

571
00:37:27.468 --> 00:37:30.183
What do you think
they're going to say in that meeting?

572
00:37:30.522 --> 00:37:32.183
Like I said--

573
00:37:33.736 --> 00:37:38.150
That the man got caught
with his pants down. literally.

574
00:37:38.729 --> 00:37:41.929
He got caught having sex in a car
with another man.

575
00:37:42.018 --> 00:37:43.901
and a white man at that.

576
00:37:44.338 --> 00:37:47.731
that you have got to get rid of him.
cut him loose.

577
00:37:48.056 --> 00:37:51.477
That arrest warrant he's got.
it's not going to go anywhere.

578
00:37:51.694 --> 00:37:56.715
He committed a lewd act.
got sentenced to 60 days in jail.

579
00:37:57.369 --> 00:38:01.171
and now is a registered sex offender
in the State of California.

580
00:38:02.672 --> 00:38:08.804
[sighs] Russ was our chief organizer
for the March on Washington.

581
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.536
Montgomery was practically all him.

582
00:38:14.955 --> 00:38:19.760
[sighs] He introduced me
to the non-violent teachings of Gandhi.

583
00:38:20.254 --> 00:38:23.322
and now they want me
to end my friendship with him

584
00:38:23.472 --> 00:38:24.917
just because he chooses to--

585
00:38:25.011 --> 00:38:28.809
Look. either you could exile him
[?] of your friendship.

586
00:38:29.176 --> 00:38:32.230
or do nothing
and get exiled along with him.

587
00:38:32.512 --> 00:38:36.211
Because believe me. this movement
will go on without him.

588
00:38:36.512 --> 00:38:38.390
and if necessary. without you.

589
00:38:43.736 --> 00:38:45.510
Is this what they're whispering?

590
00:38:45.877 --> 00:38:47.435
It's no whispering.

591
00:38:47.802 --> 00:38:51.331
Please keep your personal dislikes
for him out of this.

592
00:38:51.482 --> 00:38:56.512
He has done all he can.
you just got to get rid of him now.

593
00:38:56.992 --> 00:38:59.802
If not. you can't blame anybody
but yourself

594
00:38:59.887 --> 00:39:01.425
when it all goes downhill.

595
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.437
I can clearly see
where you stand on this.

596
00:39:04.658 --> 00:39:06.795
and whose side of this that you're on.

597
00:39:07.397 --> 00:39:12.263
I stand on the outside.
outside of a burning house.

598
00:39:14.583 --> 00:39:17.901
You have a good meeting.
peace be with you.

599
00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:29.802
You got one shot.
and one shot only to get this right.

600
00:39:29.905 --> 00:39:32.931
Excuse me.
but I do believe you called me.

601
00:39:33.115 --> 00:39:36.527
and from what you were told.
this is not [?]

602
00:39:36.621 --> 00:39:39.058
This ain't like no entrapment
that you've ever done before.

603
00:39:39.138 --> 00:39:40.550
You got my money?

604
00:39:40.677 --> 00:39:42.080
Slow your ass down.

605
00:39:42.423 --> 00:39:45.590
This money comes with instructions
and consequences.

606
00:39:46.324 --> 00:39:49.477
I usually don't work
with people I don't know. so--

607
00:39:49.651 --> 00:39:53.289
You reached out to a mutual associate.
and they reached out to me.

608
00:39:53.407 --> 00:39:58.225
so apparently. they trust you.
and without a question trust me.

609
00:39:58.936 --> 00:40:01.628
The less I need to know about you.
the better.

610
00:40:02.738 --> 00:40:05.157
I trust that they told you that.
if you do this.

611
00:40:05.407 --> 00:40:08.884
your life as you know it
will never be the same again.

612
00:40:09.011 --> 00:40:12.428
Look. I was told that you needed
a woman like me

613
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.762
to get close to Doctor King

614
00:40:15.369 --> 00:40:18.672
and see if he was even interested
in taking payments.

615
00:40:18.809 --> 00:40:22.320
First off. I'm going to need you
to hold up on that Doctor King shit.

616
00:40:22.828 --> 00:40:25.430
I need someone that can sleep with.
or frame.

617
00:40:25.618 --> 00:40:28.663
or even go public
about Martin Luther King Jr.

618
00:40:29.515 --> 00:40:30.842
Wait. you want me to--?

619
00:40:30.955 --> 00:40:32.550
Sleep with Martin Luther.

620
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.743
I don't know if I--

621
00:40:34.823 --> 00:40:35.910
Need this money?

622
00:40:36.183 --> 00:40:39.454
No. to even be a part of this mess.

623
00:40:40.376 --> 00:40:42.310
This shit you got going ain't right.

624
00:40:43.016 --> 00:40:44.560
Well. it may be too late now

625
00:40:45.021 --> 00:40:47.392
because you know way more
than you need to.

626
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.952
You're the trouble
that I've been looking for.

627
00:40:52.197 --> 00:40:54.136
Number two. Mr. Nat.

628
00:40:56.371 --> 00:40:58.235
Excuse me. miss.
Can you give us a second?

629
00:40:58.343 --> 00:41:00.122
I need just a minute of his life.

630
00:41:01.209 --> 00:41:03.058
This will only take a few minutes.

631
00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.705
Don't tiptoe too far now. Miss Sophia.

632
00:41:08.131 --> 00:41:10.475
Now I don't know
what kind of colored man are you

633
00:41:10.597 --> 00:41:11.308
but you got a lot-

634
00:41:11.374 --> 00:41:12.809
Let me stop you right there. Pastor.

635
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.541
No. you can't stop me nowhere
or the God I serve.

636
00:41:17.364 --> 00:41:20.701
You're the devil reincarnated.

637
00:41:20.856 --> 00:41:22.588
Nothing but pure evil.

638
00:41:22.903 --> 00:41:24.607
I heard about you.

639
00:41:24.842 --> 00:41:30.611
Yes. white man got you on a payroll
to destroy the MIA and the SCLC.

640
00:41:30.847 --> 00:41:33.101
Well. you better pray a little harder.

641
00:41:33.637 --> 00:41:38.178
My assignment is
way. way. way more than that.

642
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.164
God don't like this.

643
00:41:40.291 --> 00:41:43.021
Motherfucking God don't like me.

644
00:41:48.767 --> 00:41:50.362
Stay away from us.

645
00:41:50.795 --> 00:41:52.635
We out here preaching the good word.

646
00:41:52.757 --> 00:41:55.308
trying to put in a good fight
for good honest black folk.

647
00:41:55.397 --> 00:41:56.729
News flash.

648
00:41:57.355 --> 00:41:59.491
I'm not the only one that's coming.

649
00:41:59.882 --> 00:42:00.978
You know what?

650
00:42:01.181 --> 00:42:05.341
Everybody has a dash
between their birth and their death

651
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:10.705
and. if it does your heart any good.
I'll preach your funeral for free.

652
00:42:12.856 --> 00:42:14.880
You do that. motherfucker.

653
00:42:15.134 --> 00:42:16.710
Get out of here.

654
00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.920
Sophia. you want this money or what?

655
00:42:26.517 --> 00:42:28.658
Excuse me. Miss Lorraine?

656
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:30.287
Lorraine. it is. right?

657
00:42:30.418 --> 00:42:35.402
Yes. it is Lady Lorraine but I do believe
you know my name already.

658
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.800
Hot to trot.

659
00:42:39.256 --> 00:42:41.115
I was just making sure.

660
00:42:41.665 --> 00:42:43.195
How can I help you this evening?

661
00:42:43.576 --> 00:42:50.230
You can help all of us by staying out
of Dr. King's face so much.

662
00:42:51.482 --> 00:42:53.472
[?] that would help.

663
00:42:53.717 --> 00:42:55.788
So you know my name

664
00:42:55.868 --> 00:42:59.327
but you don't know
that I'm actually his assistant.

665
00:42:59.425 --> 00:43:01.280
Well. we think that--

666
00:43:01.402 --> 00:43:02.404
We?

667
00:43:04.112 --> 00:43:05.901
Where's the rest of we at?

668
00:43:06.334 --> 00:43:09.392
Didn't the Bible say
all my accusers should be present?

669
00:43:09.548 --> 00:43:12.343
The Bible also speaks about the wicked

670
00:43:12.672 --> 00:43:15.054
and the manner in which
they carry themselves.

671
00:43:15.345 --> 00:43:16.729
Let me reel you back in.

672
00:43:16.818 --> 00:43:19.581
It says that the wicked are amongst us.

673
00:43:21.044 --> 00:43:25.308
How many times have you denied [?]?

674
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:33.990
You see that's where we go wrong
when we look at a man of God as God.

675
00:43:35.087 --> 00:43:39.863
Now I love my reverends
but I'm not in love with neither of them.

676
00:43:40.894 --> 00:43:43.190
You can kindly take that information

677
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.312
and update whoever it is
that you need to inform.

678
00:43:47.835 --> 00:43:49.562
You see I don't take notes.

679
00:43:50.065 --> 00:43:52.945
That's one of the things that you do

680
00:43:53.129 --> 00:43:56.207
and I know it's going to be hard
for you to keep your legs closed

681
00:43:56.296 --> 00:44:00.592
when you're straddling both sides
of the fence but you go on.

682
00:44:01.181 --> 00:44:03.157
You go on now and play your part.

683
00:44:03.298 --> 00:44:05.849
If I didn't have
something more pressing to do--

684
00:44:05.971 --> 00:44:08.734
Like finishing your itinerary?

685
00:44:08.894 --> 00:44:10.484
I'll get you straight.

686
00:44:10.884 --> 00:44:12.112
Go on now.

687
00:44:12.207 --> 00:44:13.204
Scoot.

688
00:44:13.308 --> 00:44:17.684
[chuckles] I know you've got
to make sure that the people believe

689
00:44:17.788 --> 00:44:20.682
that the poor peoples' march
is still going on.

690
00:44:23.397 --> 00:44:26.282
I'm sure that folks are going to have

691
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:30.042
a lot of good things
to say about you. Sister Florence.

692
00:44:30.362 --> 00:44:33.115
but the sad part is. and it really is sad.

693
00:44:33.807 --> 00:44:39.087
that you're going to have to die first
before anyone could hear about it.

694
00:44:39.538 --> 00:44:41.204
Well. look at that.

695
00:44:42.955 --> 00:44:45.661
You know you sound just like him now?

696
00:44:46.437 --> 00:44:49.369
I'm not talking about Reverend King.

697
00:44:50.047 --> 00:44:55.369
I'm talking about your half-Asian [?]

698
00:45:06.748 --> 00:45:09.176
It's 3:06 PM. cousin Virginia.

699
00:45:09.792 --> 00:45:11.722
I'm fixing to get ready for work.

700
00:45:12.207 --> 00:45:16.475
Mr. Walters and Mrs. Laurie
don't play about people being late.

701
00:45:16.672 --> 00:45:21.115
Child. I ran to get you on the phone. Ellen.
and now you want to go running.

702
00:45:21.797 --> 00:45:28.197
I'm running because Mr. King. your pastor.
and his guys are here.

703
00:45:28.447 --> 00:45:30.649
Child. I see the pastor all the time.

704
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:33.082
Now what you need to do is call me

705
00:45:33.167 --> 00:45:37.609
when that there Isaac Hayes comes
[?] a night or two at the motel job.

706
00:45:38.056 --> 00:45:40.828
I fed Mr. King and them last night.

707
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.569
All they ever order is hamburgers.

708
00:45:45.783 --> 00:45:47.308
What I don't understand

709
00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:50.221
is why they don't have
better security where they are.

710
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.917
I don't understand that either.

711
00:45:53.171 --> 00:45:57.157
That FBI. they'll watch him.
they'll follow him.

712
00:45:57.298 --> 00:46:00.315
but they don't put no effort
into trying to protect him.

713
00:46:00.658 --> 00:46:04.790
I'm pretty sure the whole town knows
where he's laying his head at.

714
00:46:05.091 --> 00:46:08.931
People come to that hotel all the time
to get a glimpse of him.

715
00:46:10.056 --> 00:46:13.195
I just don't understand
why he came back here

716
00:46:13.275 --> 00:46:15.190
for the sanitation stuff again.

717
00:46:15.312 --> 00:46:19.976
I'm telling you there's this group
that came to town called the Invaders.

718
00:46:20.414 --> 00:46:25.002
They intentionally made
that march violent last month.

719
00:46:26.122 --> 00:46:30.536
Pastor is bent on making
things peaceful this time around.

720
00:46:31.134 --> 00:46:33.628
Cousin. that man is stressed.

721
00:46:35.407 --> 00:46:37.647
Goes out on the balcony smoking.

722
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.952
Parking lot floor
full of cigarette butts.

723
00:46:43.251 --> 00:46:44.710
Then go back into the room

724
00:46:44.814 --> 00:46:48.517
and all you hear
is grown men pillow fighting.

725
00:46:48.847 --> 00:46:50.051
Child. you know what?

726
00:46:50.136 --> 00:46:53.190
I just pray that they make it home.

727
00:46:53.312 --> 00:46:55.242
They all make it home safe.

728
00:46:55.571 --> 00:46:56.842
I really. really do.

729
00:46:56.941 --> 00:47:00.075
I feel something in my spirit. though.
I got to tell you.

730
00:47:00.263 --> 00:47:04.004
I really. really think
that the last time he was there.

731
00:47:04.112 --> 00:47:07.600
there was nothing but a dry run
as to how they was going to set him up.

732
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.767
I'm telling you.
I just feel it in my spirit. girl.

733
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.828
Virginia. I don't want to be
no eye witness to history

734
00:47:16.207 --> 00:47:19.303
so I just work
and keep my mouth shut.

735
00:47:20.418 --> 00:47:23.543
Every time I mention to our boss.

736
00:47:23.665 --> 00:47:25.585
the black couple that owns the hotel.

737
00:47:25.863 --> 00:47:30.310
that Mr. King should probably be
on a less visible side of the hotel.

738
00:47:31.435 --> 00:47:37.124
all they would tell me is
that the room that they gave him

739
00:47:37.228 --> 00:47:39.138
was the one they were told
to place him in.

740
00:47:39.237 --> 00:47:41.345
Now how are they going to let
somebody else

741
00:47:41.496 --> 00:47:43.435
tell them where to place somebody?

742
00:47:43.736 --> 00:47:45.463
How they do that?

743
00:47:45.618 --> 00:47:48.790
Ellen. I'm going to let you go. okay?

744
00:47:48.908 --> 00:47:50.964
Now. whatever you do.
be careful out there now.

745
00:47:51.058 --> 00:47:52.367
I love you.

746
00:47:52.771 --> 00:47:55.030
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

747
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.955
Does your pastor know what a friendly is?

748
00:48:01.877 --> 00:48:06.070
Does your reverend know that
he is only a citizen of this here country

749
00:48:06.291 --> 00:48:11.011
and he is not a citizen
or a spokesperson for the entire world?

750
00:48:11.402 --> 00:48:16.945
Does Dr. King understand that
the speech he made a year to this day

751
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:20.235
about his opposition
to the war in Vietnam

752
00:48:20.352 --> 00:48:23.228
is what started crafting his own eulogy?

753
00:48:23.482 --> 00:48:24.927
Hold on.

754
00:48:25.072 --> 00:48:26.969
Are you going to let me answer?

755
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:31.138
There is no longer an opportunity
for any answers. Sister Virginia.

756
00:48:31.345 --> 00:48:33.604
Well. let me tell you this here. sister.

757
00:48:33.882 --> 00:48:37.275
It's just about time we stop
scratching where there's no itch

758
00:48:37.411 --> 00:48:40.240
and we stop laughing
where there's no tickle.

759
00:48:40.583 --> 00:48:45.580
I agree but forces like J. Edgar and [?]

760
00:48:46.075 --> 00:48:47.844
are doing everything in their power

761
00:48:47.943 --> 00:48:51.632
to make sure that Martin doesn't make it
to his poor people campaign

762
00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:53.101
in Washington.

763
00:48:56.155 --> 00:48:59.637
Can you please explain to us
the reason for this last-minute meeting?

764
00:49:00.047 --> 00:49:02.837
Make it quick because I got
somewhere that I need to be.

765
00:49:02.997 --> 00:49:06.305
Inside each envelope
is what is needed of you next.

766
00:49:06.828 --> 00:49:10.160
The location where you will be
at the time of each event.

767
00:49:10.574 --> 00:49:13.844
the allegations
that you will put forth through

768
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.898
the press outlets that we will be providing.

769
00:49:17.397 --> 00:49:21.708
and. last but not least.
the best gift of all. your final payments.

770
00:49:22.668 --> 00:49:24.004
Where's my plane ticket?

771
00:49:24.112 --> 00:49:25.232
Plane ticket?

772
00:49:25.435 --> 00:49:26.451
Child. where you going?

773
00:49:26.536 --> 00:49:30.117
Martha. I believe you have
enough money in your envelope

774
00:49:30.197 --> 00:49:32.061
to cover your ticket to Memphis.

775
00:49:32.931 --> 00:49:35.600
I didn't know
that you was going down to Memphis.

776
00:49:36.696 --> 00:49:40.757
Who are you and why am I paying
for my own ticket?

777
00:49:40.988 --> 00:49:44.334
You don't expect me
to start a paper trail. do you?

778
00:49:44.451 --> 00:49:46.545
Do you think that would be wise of me?

779
00:49:46.701 --> 00:49:49.162
How are we going to explain her
not being in church?

780
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:51.585
Something ain't right.

781
00:49:53.298 --> 00:49:54.545
You're leaving us out to dry.

782
00:49:54.621 --> 00:49:55.694
You know that. don't you?

783
00:49:55.783 --> 00:49:56.941
Miss Walker-

784
00:49:57.148 --> 00:49:59.204
My name is Marie St. Jean.

785
00:49:59.637 --> 00:50:03.143
Sister Martha. you can spend
the money as you wish.

786
00:50:03.458 --> 00:50:07.058
Yes. do as you wish. but if I were you.

787
00:50:07.265 --> 00:50:10.277
I would make it my business
to make it to Memphis.

788
00:50:10.522 --> 00:50:13.345
Fisher. who is this

789
00:50:14.004 --> 00:50:18.047
and why am I paying out
of my own pocket for my own flight?

790
00:50:18.301 --> 00:50:19.929
You know. y'all are still not telling us

791
00:50:20.051 --> 00:50:21.811
how we are supposed
to cover for ourselves.

792
00:50:22.028 --> 00:50:23.976
Do y'all got a plan in place for this?

793
00:50:24.268 --> 00:50:26.447
There is a plan in place.

794
00:50:27.477 --> 00:50:31.218
This here.
this ain’t sitting right with me.

795
00:50:31.741 --> 00:50:35.237
I don't think I'm going to be making
this here trip.

796
00:50:35.948 --> 00:50:38.927
Yes. what she really wants to know is.

797
00:50:39.247 --> 00:50:42.061
are y’all going to kill her
when she gets to Memphis?

798
00:50:42.856 --> 00:50:46.169
The killing of Sister Martha
would not be helping our agenda.

799
00:50:46.461 --> 00:50:50.352
Besides. nobody cares
if she’s alive or dead.

800
00:50:50.489 --> 00:50:51.647
On the other hand.

801
00:50:52.098 --> 00:50:55.609
if you or some of the information
that Miss Martha has

802
00:50:55.910 --> 00:51:00.047
goes out and about
and makes itself known.

803
00:51:00.277 --> 00:51:02.320
You don't have to worry about that.

804
00:51:02.804 --> 00:51:08.131
Well. since I don't have to fly out.
what's your plans for me?

805
00:51:08.461 --> 00:51:10.912
You will meet me at the airport.

806
00:51:11.148 --> 00:51:15.101
carrying one of the five weapons
needed in Tennessee.

807
00:51:25.505 --> 00:51:29.143
Why is every page in here blank?

808
00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.437
Great. great job Miss Carol.

809
00:51:39.096 --> 00:51:41.007
There go your loose ends.

810
00:51:44.814 --> 00:51:48.051
Every now and again.
you see a man down

811
00:51:48.922 --> 00:51:50.870
and we refuse to help that man

812
00:51:51.247 --> 00:51:53.802
because we’re too busy
worried about where we're going

813
00:51:53.938 --> 00:51:57.214
and what might happen to us
if we do stop and help him.

814
00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.602
How come we never become
this good Samaritan

815
00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:02.649
and ask ourselves

816
00:52:04.367 --> 00:52:07.538
what would happen
if we don’t help that man.

817
00:52:09.557 --> 00:52:15.360
that woman. that child.
those sanitation workers.

818
00:52:18.418 --> 00:52:21.468
what would happen to them
if we don't help?

819
00:52:27.938 --> 00:52:30.211
We’re going to end up
on the wrong side of history for this.

820
00:52:30.823 --> 00:52:33.487
It depends on who's history
you’re talking about.

821
00:52:35.769 --> 00:52:38.437
What happened the last time
King came to Memphis?

822
00:52:39.124 --> 00:52:43.200
The last time he was in Memphis
the protest unknowingly became violent.

823
00:52:43.345 --> 00:52:47.604
Let's not forget two of your co-workers
were crushed inside their own trunks.

824
00:52:48.282 --> 00:52:49.825
What did we promise him?

825
00:52:50.287 --> 00:52:52.663
We promised them
a none violent protest.

826
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:54.672
Look. that shit broke out.

827
00:52:54.875 --> 00:52:58.174
Things got out of hand
but we did not cause it.

828
00:52:58.771 --> 00:53:02.743
In Charlotte. I seen some familiar faces.

829
00:53:03.665 --> 00:53:05.543
You saw them
because she has some of the people

830
00:53:05.623 --> 00:53:07.540
that work right alongside of us.

831
00:53:07.745 --> 00:53:11.143
Malik. people are frustrated.

832
00:53:11.764 --> 00:53:15.369
Blacks and whites are frustrated.

833
00:53:15.807 --> 00:53:19.256
You have a white man standing
next to a black man. that he can't--

834
00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:21.280
They both hate Dr. King.

835
00:53:23.021 --> 00:53:24.908
How the hell did we get here?

836
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:28.367
You paid some of the same blacks
that were out there

837
00:53:28.461 --> 00:53:31.501
to hold up the sign that said.
"[?] stay away."

838
00:53:31.976 --> 00:53:33.760
I'm being paid to do a job.

839
00:53:33.882 --> 00:53:37.087
You’re selling your soul
every which way you turn.

840
00:53:38.983 --> 00:53:45.435
So it's my fault that we as blacks
are not on the same page?

841
00:53:45.948 --> 00:53:48.545
Shit. you’re not even
in the same fucking book.

842
00:53:49.341 --> 00:53:52.602
Planting people to incite riots
isn’t anything new.

843
00:53:55.449 --> 00:53:57.308
This is a different type of seed.

844
00:53:58.014 --> 00:54:04.837
Dr. King has burned bridge after bridge.
after fucking bridge.

845
00:54:05.374 --> 00:54:06.912
That doesn’t mean we have to warm

846
00:54:07.011 --> 00:54:09.741
our fucking hands off
of the fucking burning bridge.

847
00:54:10.931 --> 00:54:12.574
When do we push back?

848
00:54:13.364 --> 00:54:15.143
When do we fight back?

849
00:54:15.477 --> 00:54:21.162
When do we say. no. I cannot help you
take down another black man.

850
00:54:21.981 --> 00:54:24.211
You tell their asses no.

851
00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:27.811
Fuck that. Let their asses
do their own damn devil work.

852
00:54:28.635 --> 00:54:31.275
You sound like
you’re afraid to move forward.

853
00:54:31.534 --> 00:54:32.715
You sound like--

854
00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:33.915
You sold them out.

855
00:54:37.792 --> 00:54:41.487
They’re expecting 1.300
to come out here and protest

856
00:54:42.324 --> 00:54:45.632
and they’re going to be [?].

857
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.680
[?]

858
00:54:48.404 --> 00:54:50.235
You’re talking just to be talking.

859
00:54:51.891 --> 00:54:54.611
Where the fuck you and your family
going to run to?

860
00:54:54.776 --> 00:54:58.070
Your fucking mother is stretched out
in the living room on her oxygen.

861
00:54:58.277 --> 00:54:59.840
What the fuck y’all want?

862
00:55:00.084 --> 00:55:01.971
You don’t even have
to go out there for them.

863
00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:03.971
Let’s get this shit straight.

864
00:55:04.696 --> 00:55:08.790
You both are just expendable assets
on a payroll.

865
00:55:09.265 --> 00:55:13.976
It just so happened. it worked out perfect.
that you both are sanitation workers.

866
00:55:14.131 --> 00:55:18.461
I’m just sick to know
that y’all pulled it to be [?]

867
00:55:18.611 --> 00:55:22.000
for you. your co-workers. and Dr. King.

868
00:55:22.169 --> 00:55:24.183
You’re not going to leave us out to dry.

869
00:55:24.315 --> 00:55:25.910
We’re all being used.

870
00:55:26.611 --> 00:55:29.628
The people who have chosen
their position on Dr. King's views

871
00:55:29.788 --> 00:55:32.192
and they dug themselves in

872
00:55:32.418 --> 00:55:36.974
therefore trust that
Dr. King [?] him is no longer.

873
00:55:38.861 --> 00:55:42.715
So in a small. small way.
we are all contributing

874
00:55:42.814 --> 00:55:44.056
to this misdeed

875
00:55:44.183 --> 00:55:47.388
and this misdeed is going to affect man
for years to come.

876
00:55:48.578 --> 00:55:53.581
That man is at that motel.
surrounded by who he's surrounded by.

877
00:55:56.748 --> 00:56:00.131
I just hope he’s praying to a known God
about his unknown future.

878
00:56:01.552 --> 00:56:08.691
We just got to get past this dream.
this fantasy of a united front.

879
00:56:10.738 --> 00:56:13.905
Too many of us has [?]
the other side.

880
00:56:14.042 --> 00:56:19.651
A side that never wants to see
unity amongst us as a race.

881
00:56:21.143 --> 00:56:23.661
I wonder how
reverend Willy sleeps at night

882
00:56:24.762 --> 00:56:26.649
because I know I won’t be able to.

883
00:56:26.908 --> 00:56:30.108
There's a certain level of hypocrisy
in America

884
00:56:30.437 --> 00:56:32.291
that soon will be exposed.

885
00:56:33.002 --> 00:56:35.632
If the two of you
[?] remember anything.

886
00:56:35.915 --> 00:56:41.581
remember that one day your usefulness
will no longer be needed.

887
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.672
[gun shot]

888
00:56:46.743 --> 00:56:51.750
[crowd screaming]

889
00:56:58.329 --> 00:57:01.430
Is that the junior G man [?]?

890
00:57:01.703 --> 00:57:03.110
Do you personally know of anyone

891
00:57:03.214 --> 00:57:06.051
who wanted to hurt or contributed
to the killing of Dr. King?

892
00:57:06.197 --> 00:57:07.807
Personally. no.

893
00:57:08.023 --> 00:57:10.183
Did you have a dislike for Dr. King?

894
00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:12.560
No. Dr. King and I are friends.

895
00:57:13.176 --> 00:57:15.905
Do you have a personal vendetta
or agenda

896
00:57:16.018 --> 00:57:17.472
against Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.?

897
00:57:17.557 --> 00:57:19.049
Nothing?

898
00:57:19.327 --> 00:57:21.477
Dr. King and I are friends.

899
00:57:22.018 --> 00:57:25.134
We go back to childhood days
playing in the sandbox together.

900
00:57:25.308 --> 00:57:27.129
We used to walk to school together.

901
00:57:27.312 --> 00:57:29.129
That man took me to church.

902
00:57:29.491 --> 00:57:33.369
As a matter of fact. he gave me
a personal relationship with God.

903
00:57:33.675 --> 00:57:36.400
There is no amount of money in the world
that you can offer me

904
00:57:36.607 --> 00:57:37.976
to get me to betray him.

905
00:57:39.129 --> 00:57:41.298
Who mentioned anything about betrayal?

906
00:57:41.807 --> 00:57:43.694
Look. I don’t have an ounce of hate in me.

907
00:57:44.381 --> 00:57:46.531
Reverend King did what he had to do.

908
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:49.237
Why I feel you have
no problem with him being dead.

909
00:57:49.336 --> 00:57:51.237
Don’t project your feelings out on me.

910
00:57:51.835 --> 00:57:54.672
How we start with someone
is not usually how we end up with them.

911
00:57:54.832 --> 00:57:57.392
We did some great things
with the movement

912
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:58.823
and we lost a great man.

913
00:57:58.903 --> 00:58:00.301
A great. great man.

914
00:58:00.437 --> 00:58:03.289
A man who helped pushed you
into something that you helped create.

915
00:58:03.392 --> 00:58:05.802
All because of your sexual preferences
at that.

916
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.880
Martin was under a lot of pressure
from a lot of black leaders--

917
00:58:08.983 --> 00:58:11.548
Who felt that a gay man shouldn’t--

918
00:58:12.757 --> 00:58:14.828
Doesn’t that make you angry?

919
00:58:15.614 --> 00:58:20.075
Yes. it makes me very angry
but this is not about me.

920
00:58:20.385 --> 00:58:23.971
What you need to do is go out there
and find who killed Martin.

921
00:58:24.174 --> 00:58:27.374
Why are you not using your resources
to find out

922
00:58:27.491 --> 00:58:29.849
who financed the man
who killed my friend?

923
00:58:31.275 --> 00:58:32.621
Your friend.

924
00:58:33.501 --> 00:58:35.934
Yes. he was my friend.

925
00:58:36.098 --> 00:58:37.505
Are you sure about that?

926
00:58:37.609 --> 00:58:40.578
Because I surely heard different
with my own two ears.

927
00:58:40.701 --> 00:58:44.743
I’ve heard some audio about you.
this Russ guy and a client

928
00:58:44.889 --> 00:58:47.200
meeting up with the now missing
Agent Fisher.

929
00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:51.618
Am I here so that I can give you
valuable information

930
00:58:51.722 --> 00:58:57.684
on the last days of Dr. King
or is it because of your missing colleague?

931
00:58:58.141 --> 00:59:00.225
Now if it’s the latter.

932
00:59:00.583 --> 00:59:04.183
then I don’t know
what it is that you are talking about.

933
00:59:04.385 --> 00:59:07.670
Yes. the fuck you do know
what the fuck it is I’m talking about.

934
00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:10.494
Because I’ve heard audio
of Dr. King himself

935
00:59:10.795 --> 00:59:14.621
talking about how you yourself
have set up meetings for him

936
00:59:14.856 --> 00:59:16.360
and it does not look good for you. lady.

937
00:59:16.456 --> 00:59:18.465
Did you bring me here to be interviewed

938
00:59:19.129 --> 00:59:23.778
or to be discredited for some bullshit
that you are going to be resenting later?

939
00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:27.712
Now. I’m curious as to why

940
00:59:27.774 --> 00:59:31.035
these accusations
with audios that you’ve heard

941
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:33.124
have anything to do

942
00:59:33.341 --> 00:59:37.077
with finding the real killers
that murdered Marting Luther King Jr?

943
00:59:40.607 --> 00:59:43.101
I don’t think you know
what you think you know.

944
00:59:44.668 --> 00:59:46.917
You cannot make me change my story.

945
00:59:47.021 --> 00:59:48.969
I am telling you the truth.

946
00:59:49.228 --> 00:59:52.658
I heard that gunshot
right above my head and I looked up.

947
00:59:54.447 --> 00:59:59.134
I saw the gun powder or something
come right out of that rifle.

948
01:00:00.541 --> 01:00:05.694
I saw that white hand pull that rifle
right back into the window.

949
01:00:06.004 --> 01:00:08.141
No. that gunshot came
from somewhere else.

950
01:00:08.254 --> 01:00:10.832
What you heard was the sound
bouncing off the buildings.

951
01:00:11.392 --> 01:00:12.654
No. it didn't.

952
01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:16.145
That shot came from the firehouse.

953
01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:19.280
Them men that was standing there
looked right at me

954
01:00:19.364 --> 01:00:23.487
and I got a good look at them too.
before I put my head down and walked off.

955
01:00:23.929 --> 01:00:28.564
I pass by that firehouse every day
on my way to work

956
01:00:28.785 --> 01:00:30.621
where Dr. King was killed.

957
01:00:31.468 --> 01:00:35.294
I strongly suggest you
rethink what you're saying right now

958
01:00:35.934 --> 01:00:38.635
and rethink it
as though your life depends on it.

959
01:00:39.007 --> 01:00:41.764
Sir. there is nothing to rethink.

960
01:00:42.964 --> 01:00:46.442
I heard those gunshots and we owe--

961
01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.945
I don't owe shit

962
01:00:49.336 --> 01:00:52.334
but you still owe the county 90 days
for what Mr. Bailey said

963
01:00:52.432 --> 01:00:54.112
that you stole from the motel.

964
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:58.705
Now. sadly.
Mrs. Bailey passed of a heart attack

965
01:00:58.832 --> 01:01:00.870
a few hours after King got shot

966
01:01:02.856 --> 01:01:06.512
so the only Bailey that didn't want
to see you locked up is gone.

967
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:11.077
I'm sorry about Mrs. Bailey.

968
01:01:11.802 --> 01:01:13.614
God bless her soul.

969
01:01:15.261 --> 01:01:18.997
I could never bring myself
to steal from them.

970
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:24.616
They gave me [?]
next to nothing.

971
01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:28.315
We know that he found you
on the streets in the gutter.

972
01:01:28.898 --> 01:01:32.400
brought you in and you mean to tell me
you couldn't have done better by him?

973
01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:37.223
And I know you devils killed him
in that there hospital.

974
01:01:37.792 --> 01:01:40.720
Y'all took your shot. y'all got him down

975
01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.075
and there was no way

976
01:01:42.174 --> 01:01:44.503
y'all was going to let him
leave that hospital alive.

977
01:01:44.748 --> 01:01:46.334
You don't know shit.

978
01:01:46.522 --> 01:01:50.814
What I do know is you bastards set him up

979
01:01:50.992 --> 01:01:53.035
and then you motherfuckers killed him.

980
01:01:53.181 --> 01:01:54.974
Ain't no other story to tell.

981
01:01:55.623 --> 01:01:56.997
Now. what's your name?

982
01:01:58.602 --> 01:01:59.802
Patterson?

983
01:02:00.004 --> 01:02:04.061
I personally know that. if I was you.
I would watch what it is that I was saying.

984
01:02:04.145 --> 01:02:06.969
But you're not me
and what you going to do?

985
01:02:07.124 --> 01:02:08.367
Kill me too?

986
01:02:09.816 --> 01:02:12.752
Nigga. you ain't worth the request.

987
01:02:13.303 --> 01:02:16.098
You're going to watch
how you speak to me.

988
01:02:16.235 --> 01:02:19.360
No. I fucking won't
because Fisher's still fucking missing

989
01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:21.661
and two of his assets are missing.

990
01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:23.298
He knew the risk.

991
01:02:23.421 --> 01:02:25.844
He took the assignment.

992
01:02:26.334 --> 01:02:30.851
You better tie up all them loose ends
because. when this shit rolls back--

993
01:02:31.689 --> 01:02:34.611
The four men got Earl is in custody

994
01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:38.009
and you're still worried
about what's under your fingernails.

995
01:02:38.348 --> 01:02:41.223
I've washed my hands with this. Coleman.

996
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.061
By the time thet put all of this together.

997
01:02:44.287 --> 01:02:46.870
you might be dead. I might be dead.

998
01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:49.778
or I might just be an old lady
sitting on the porch

999
01:02:49.887 --> 01:02:53.129
listening to my great-grandchildren
talk about school

1000
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.842
or what the real enemy
is teaching them on American history.

1001
01:02:58.277 --> 01:03:02.649
We only know
what we're taught and told. right?

1002
01:03:10.776 --> 01:03:19.825
[music]

1003
01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:21.830
Freedom. spread out across my chest

1004
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:24.117
and. if I die.
then I pray it's my cause of death.

1005
01:03:24.202 --> 01:03:26.447
Baby. my freedom worth
more than you'll ever know.

1006
01:03:26.531 --> 01:03:28.691
And if they're trying to take it
from me. I'm ready to go.

1007
01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:31.096
Baby. my freedom worth
hundreds of shots.

1008
01:03:31.181 --> 01:03:33.454
Before I give in.
know it's coming with you in a box.

1009
01:03:33.538 --> 01:03:35.651
Know my freedom ain't one you could buy.

1010
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.065
Just know my freedom got me here
'til the day that I die.

1011
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:39.181
It's freedom or us.

1012
01:03:39.275 --> 01:03:40.348
We ready to die.

1013
01:03:40.432 --> 01:03:42.625
We lived in the shit.
you fed us the lie.

1014
01:03:42.715 --> 01:03:45.002
You put us in dirt.
we reached for the sky.

1015
01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:47.308
You needed a way. we gave you the guy.

1016
01:03:47.392 --> 01:03:49.590
Packed a million on a bus.
this freedom gonna ride.

1017
01:03:49.665 --> 01:03:51.910
You can try to keep us down
but this freedom gonna ride.

1018
01:03:51.985 --> 01:03:54.221
Black hand in the air.

Know that our freedom is high.

1021
01:03:58.908 --> 01:03:59.967
Baby girl. hand me the joint.

[?]

1024
01:04:03.487 --> 01:04:05.703
'Cause everybody on this planet
know freedom is ours.

1025
01:04:05.783 --> 01:04:08.018
And every moment we deny
that's fuel for the fire.

1026
01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:10.329
So. when you look me in my eyes.
you see it inside.

1027
01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.696
Asking me what are my thoughts?
I only got freedom in mind.

1028
01:04:12.771 --> 01:04:15.237
Hand me the keys to cage.
I'm going to put freedom inside.

1029
01:04:15.388 --> 01:04:17.374
Freedom spread out across my chest.

1030
01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:19.585
And. if I die.
then I pray it's my cause of death.

1031
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:21.661
Baby. my freedom worth
more than you'll ever know.

1032
01:04:21.731 --> 01:04:23.962
And. if they try to take it from me.
I'm ready to go.

1033
01:04:24.032 --> 01:04:26.480
Baby. my freedom
worth hundreds of shots.

1034
01:04:26.578 --> 01:04:28.687
Before I give in. know it's coming
with you in a box.

1035
01:04:28.738 --> 01:04:30.927
Know my freedom ain't one you can buy.

1036
01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:33.355
Just know my freedom got me here
'til the day that I die.

1037
01:04:33.458 --> 01:04:35.510
Go ahead and spray us
with the hose if you want.

1038
01:04:35.595 --> 01:04:37.736
You going to turn our freedom
to a fight from a stunt.

1039
01:04:37.915 --> 01:04:40.155
You going to make a panther
turn his pride into a pump.

1040
01:04:40.258 --> 01:04:42.428
You can make five little minutes
to a month.

1041
01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.635
We going to get a president
to do it how we want.

1042
01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.040
They saying. "How high?"
before we even say. "Jump."

1043
01:04:47.115 --> 01:04:49.317
Put us in a cage
and we'll put you in a trunk.

1044
01:04:49.407 --> 01:04:51.632
You can kill us by the two's
but I promise we the one.

1045
01:04:51.703 --> 01:04:53.901
'Cause you [?] funds.

We going to get it out the hood.

But I promise when it's done.

1051
01:05:05.604 --> 01:05:07.863
Keep us [?]
we'll control it with our thumbs.

1052
01:05:07.934 --> 01:05:10.310
Show up in our passages
[?] how it comes.

1053
01:05:10.451 --> 01:05:14.752
No. when it's justice denied.
then it's no justice at all.

1054
01:05:14.894 --> 01:05:15.750
Justice.

1055
01:05:15.844 --> 01:05:17.934
Being denied today
is being denied too long.

1056
01:05:18.009 --> 01:05:21.449
You can't tuck us away in the breeze
and pray for our [?]

1057

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.190
Freedom fight.
Fight for freedom.

1060
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:29.741
Freedom fighting
cause fighting is our freedom.

1061
01:05:29.858 --> 01:05:31.538
Freedom fight. fight for freedom.

1062
01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.294
They can't stop us.
You know why?

1063
01:05:33.383 --> 01:05:35.416
Freedom can't be denied

1064
01:05:35.487 --> 01:05:37.863
and. as long as we have lungs.
we have a duty.

1065
01:05:37.943 --> 01:05:40.381
A duty to get free and stay free.

1066
01:05:40.475 --> 01:05:42.776
A duty to get free and stay free.

1067
01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:45.618
A duty to get free and stay free.

1068
01:05:45.694 --> 01:05:47.680
A duty.

1069
01:05:47.788 --> 01:05:49.454
Freedom spread out across my chest.

01:05:52.089 --> 01:05:54.305
Freedom worth more
than you'll ever know.
