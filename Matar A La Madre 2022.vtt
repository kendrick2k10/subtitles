3
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.000
TO KILL MOTHER

4
00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:34.583
Are you ''BigDickBlondie17''?

5
00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:36.458
Are you ''TheRainbowGirl''?

6
00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:39.125
Sorry for being late.

7
00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.750
It's rush hour in La Castellana.

8
00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:44.125
and I don't like my taxis speeding.

9
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.875
What shall I get us?

10
00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:49.250
I'll get it.
I'll get you a kids' meal.

11
00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:52.417
I'll get you a water.

12
00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:10.250
That's for you. put it on.

13
00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:27.667
Next.

14
00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:30.875
Good evening.

15
00:02:31.042 --> 00:02:33.833
I want a kids' meal with fries.
and a water.

16
00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:35.125
Slightly chilled.

17
00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:39.583
Excuse me.
you have to pull up your mask.

18
00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:49.875
A boy's or girl's toy?

19
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.792
You still ask that question?

20
00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:54.042
A boy's one. please.

21
00:02:57.417 --> 00:02:58.583
We only have girl's.

22
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.500
6.19 euros.

23
00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:09.750
Oh. and a large Coca-Cola with ice.

24
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.625
Relax. look:

25
00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:14.458
''Cancel twice''. ''subtotal''.
''add product'' and ''subtotal''.

26
00:03:14.542 --> 00:03:17.208
You can't press total
without having pressed subtotal.

27
00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:23.542
8.59 euros.

28
00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:27.792
To eat in or take away?

29
00:03:30.917 --> 00:03:32.375
Madam. do you want a bag?

30
00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:36.333
The lady is going to eat in.
right?

31
00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:38.375
Yes. right.

32
00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:00.625
They had no boy's toys left.

33
00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.042
- You don't mind. right?
- No. I don't.

34
00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.667
You're no longer a baby.

35
00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:09.792
Don't look at me like that.

36
00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:11.208
It makes me feel old.

37
00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:13.833
Don't feel that way.
because you're...

38
00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:15.833
Amazing for my age. yeah?
Right.

39
00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:18.750
And how old are you?

40
00:04:19.917 --> 00:04:22.542
I'm 17. but I'm turning 18 in a week.

41
00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:24.042
On January 23rd.

42
00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:26.208
although I don't enjoy my birthday.

43
00:04:26.292 --> 00:04:27.292
How come?

44
00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:29.708
Birthdays mean that you're alive.

45
00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:32.167
Not having them would be bad.

46
00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:34.625
Right. When I see you all...

47
00:04:35.292 --> 00:04:37.542
I mean. when I see grandmothers.
I think:

48
00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:39.667
''Damn. how lucky. they've lived life''.

49
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Shall we eat?

50
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.625
I love these places.

51
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.333
fast-food restaurants.

52
00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:00.625
Why?

53
00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:02.708
Because they're forbidden places.

54
00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:05.083
Going to them is a vice.

55
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.542
No hangovers. no guilt.

56
00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.083
Why are we here?

57
00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:17.000
I mean.
a woman like you in a place like this...

58
00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:18.750
I feel more free here.

59
00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:21.417
and a bit more badass.

60
00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:26.917
Why are you advertising yourself
on those sites?

61
00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:30.125
Well. I need money to pay
for my studies and vices.

62
00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:32.500
I've been doing this since I was 15.

63
00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:34.583
What about you?

64
00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:38.792
Why are you looking
for ads like mine on those sites?

65
00:05:40.917 --> 00:05:43.708
Unconsciously. for the forbidden.
I guess.

66
00:05:44.792 --> 00:05:46.500
Consciously. for company.

67
00:05:47.542 --> 00:05:49.792
And we women like younger guys.

68
00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:51.667
no matter what you're told.

69
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.917
You're really handsome.

70
00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:58.083
It's my eyes.

71
00:05:58.167 --> 00:05:59.167
Excuse me?

72
00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:00.833
I have good-boy eyes.

73
00:06:00.917 --> 00:06:03.125
although I've been told
I'm quite a rascal.

74
00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:06.333
You don't look like one.
Who told you that?

75
00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:07.958
Children.

76
00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.167
Your friends?

77
00:06:09.417 --> 00:06:11.167
No. My mates from the orphanage.

78
00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:15.875
Poor thing.

79
00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:18.292
It must have been hard.

80
00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:20.708
Were you treated well there?

81
00:06:20.792 --> 00:06:21.792
Priests...

82
00:06:22.042 --> 00:06:23.375
I've never liked priests.

83
00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:26.333
And you?

84
00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:28.458
What do you do?

85
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.750
I'm a widow now.

86
00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.375
I used to be someone's wife.

87
00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:34.542
I've never worked.

88
00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:37.167
I didn't need or wanted to.

89
00:06:37.917 --> 00:06:39.542
Don't you think
it's an easy task.

90
00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:43.583
Not all of us survive
without getting addicted to alcohol.

91
00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:47.167
to gossip shows.
or to lorazepam.

92
00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:49.792
although I've tried it a few times.

93
00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:52.458
I drink more than I should.

94
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.167
and sometimes I watch those TV shows.

95
00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:57.083
Well...

96
00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:02.167
listening to others' miseries helps me.

97
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.542
I'm going to grab more aioli sauce.

98
00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:29.875
It's the first time I'm doing this.
Having sex for cash.

99
00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:32.167
Shall we stop?

100
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.583
No. I think I'm ready.
I just wanted you to know.

101
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.458
I'll be really careful then.

102
00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:43.208
If you feel uncomfortable at some point.
let me know.

103
00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.042
I'm not a guy.

104
00:07:49.417 --> 00:07:50.417
Do you have kids?

105
00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:52.083
No.

106
00:07:56.583 --> 00:07:57.583
Do you like films?

107
00:07:59.167 --> 00:08:01.042
Only an idiot would say ''no''.

108
00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:04.292
What kind of films?

109
00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:05.625
How cute.

110
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.125
It's been long
since I've been asked that.

111
00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:12.583
Well...

112
00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:14.000
especially.

113
00:08:15.042 --> 00:08:18.542
what Americans call ''woman pictures''.

114
00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:22.208
Films. mostly big dramas.

115
00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.583
about women in the 40s. 50s. 60s...

116
00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:29.958
Bette Davis.

117
00:08:31.042 --> 00:08:32.292
Joan Crawford...

118
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.917
That sounds unfamiliar. right?

119
00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:38.875
What films do you like?

120
00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:46.458
Now I'm going to sound uncultured.

121
00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:50.083
but my favourite film has been
<i>Indiana Jones</i> since I was a kid.

122
00:08:50.167 --> 00:08:51.167
All of them.

123
00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:53.792
My mum showed me
the first one when I was two.

124
00:08:55.292 --> 00:08:56.333
I wanted to be him.

125
00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:58.333
I imitated him.

126
00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:01.792
Like. when I was on the street
and got to a zebra crossing.

127
00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.917
I'd imagine the white lines were rocks

128
00:09:06.208 --> 00:09:07.333
and the rest was lava.

129
00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:10.750
so I had to jump over them
not to fall and burn.

130
00:09:13.417 --> 00:09:15.292
I even wanted to be an archaeologist.

131
00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:19.000
That was only until Year 11.

132
00:09:19.083 --> 00:09:22.417
when a teacher showed us
an archaeology documentary in class.

133
00:09:24.292 --> 00:09:26.792
and that immediately put me off it.
So boring.

134
00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:28.500
And what do you want to do now?

135
00:09:32.042 --> 00:09:33.042
I don't know.

136
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.167
Be happy. I guess.

137
00:09:37.458 --> 00:09:38.792
And I'd like to have kids.

138
00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:40.875
Many. A bunch of them.

139
00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:45.125
But I don't know if I'd be a good dad.
That scares me a bit.

140
00:09:46.417 --> 00:09:49.292
Your considering it
means that you'll be one.

141
00:09:51.208 --> 00:09:53.125
How do you know?
You're not a mother.

142
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.042
Excuse me.

143
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.292
I need to use the restroom.

144
00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:31.292
Four. five. six...

145
00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:33.667
One. two. three...

146
00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.542
Seven. eight. nine...

147
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.875
One. two. three. four. five...

148
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.292
Can you show me your body?

149
00:11:22.833 --> 00:11:24.833
I wanted to make sure
you weren't chubby.

150
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.583
Some guys lie.

151
00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:32.917
I'm not sure what else to say.

152
00:11:38.708 --> 00:11:39.708
It's me.

153
00:11:41.833 --> 00:11:43.583
And don't talk
with your mouth full.

154
00:11:45.667 --> 00:11:46.667
Your age.

155
00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:48.667
an orphan.

156
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:50.333
<i>Indiana Jones.</i>

157
00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:52.708
the birthmark...

158
00:11:53.667 --> 00:11:55.125
You want answers. I guess.

159
00:11:58.417 --> 00:11:59.500
I can give you them.

160
00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:01.333
here and now.

161
00:12:03.042 --> 00:12:04.167
Or later.

162
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.375
You set the pace.

163
00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:08.083
I can leave if you want.

164
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.917
I'll pay for the service
and give you a good tip.

165
00:12:11.583 --> 00:12:12.583
Anything you want.

166
00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:20.417
Anything you want. Noa.
but say something.

167
00:12:24.917 --> 00:12:25.917
Why?

168
00:12:27.417 --> 00:12:28.667
I had to abandon you.

169
00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:30.583
Fuck.

170
00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.208
I don't want to make excuses any more.

171
00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:36.125
I abandoned you because I wanted to.

172
00:12:41.292 --> 00:12:43.167
I'm not asking for you to understand.

173
00:12:45.292 --> 00:12:48.167
I probably wouldn't understand
if I were in your shoes.

174
00:12:51.167 --> 00:12:52.417
Fucking hell.

175
00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:56.875
Yeah. fucking hell...

176
00:12:57.875 --> 00:12:59.542
How do I know all this is true?

177
00:13:02.708 --> 00:13:04.458
Are you messing with me.
you bitch?

178
00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:05.833
Huh?

179
00:13:06.375 --> 00:13:07.458
I promise.

180
00:13:08.292 --> 00:13:09.958
It's me.
I'm not lying.

181
00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:12.208
It's me. your mum.

182
00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:16.833
I saw something familiar in your eyes
when I got here.

183
00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:33.375
Now I know what it is.

184
00:13:35.917 --> 00:13:37.875
I'd love to say
that your life with me...

185
00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.042
would have been better than this one.

186
00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:41.292
but I can't.

187
00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:47.583
Great.

188
00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.875
I was really young
when you were born.

189
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.083
Young and selfish.

190
00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:00.292
I'd have been a bad mother to you.

191
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.458
At least you'd have been a mother.

192
00:14:03.167 --> 00:14:05.167
- Noa...
- Don't call me Noa!

193
00:14:12.542 --> 00:14:14.458
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

194
00:14:17.042 --> 00:14:20.333
I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart.

195
00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:24.708
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.250
What's your name?

197
00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:51.208
Dorita.

198
00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:35.750
Excuse me. madam.
you cannot smoke here.

199
00:16:35.833 --> 00:16:38.208
Kindly put it out
or else you'll have to leave.

200
00:16:38.792 --> 00:16:41.333
Why would you let me smoke
if it's banned. son?

201
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.500
Sorry. we thought it was allowed.

202
00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:46.042
Not since Zapatero banned it in 2006.

203
00:16:46.417 --> 00:16:47.458
Please. allow me...

204
00:16:53.042 --> 00:16:53.958
Do you want to watch

205
00:16:54.042 --> 00:16:56.500
<i>Indiana Jones and the Raiders</i>
<i>of the Lost Ark</i> tonight?

206
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.208
Well. maybe next time. son.

207
00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:00.708
In the latest film.

208
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.042
Harrison Ford is too old
and I don't like it.

209
00:17:07.208 --> 00:17:09.625
Do you want us
to call someone to pick you up?

210
00:17:10.083 --> 00:17:11.083
There's no need.

211
00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:13.000
I'm leaving with him.

212
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.417
TO MY GRANDMA DORITA

213
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.500
