I'm an idiot.

79
00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:38.608
I don't deserve these powers.
if I'm being honest.

contributing?

81

Aquaman is literally huge.
and he's so manly

85
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.890
and Batman is so cool!

And I'm just me.

87
00:05:52.923 --> 00:05:54.395
And I can't say this
to anyone else.

88
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.961
'cause my family looks to me
as a leader.

00:05:58.031 --> 00:05:59.031

91
00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:00.632
You understand I'm a...

92
00:06:01.498 --> 00:06:02.997
pediatrician.

93
00:06:04.972 --> 00:06:06.473
right?

94
00:06:06.608 --> 00:06:08.539
I mean. yeah. well.
you were recommended

95
00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:10.339

Billy Batson.

96
00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:11.641
It doesn't matter.

97
00:06:11.777 --> 00:06:13.512
Can you help fix my thoughts
so that

98
00:06:13.648 --> 00:06:15.475
they just. like. you know.
stop happening?

99
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.979
All right. look.

100
00:06:17.114 --> 00:06:18.545
And. again. pediatrician.
not a psychiatrist.

101
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:20.519
but it sounds to me like

102
00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:23.184
you're experiencing
imposter syndrome.

103
00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:26.622
And often. that originates
from trauma early in life.

104
00:06:26.757 --> 00:06:29.021
so if you don't
mind me asking.

105
00:06:29.157 --> 00:06:31.263
how well do you remember
your childhood?

106
00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:32.961
Like it was today. [chuckles]

107
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.564
Trauma? Uh. I don't know.

108
00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.031
I mean. I never met my dad.

109
00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:40.573
Uh. my mom abandoned me
at a Christmas carnival.

110
00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:42.206
I spent a lot of time
in the foster system.

111
00:06:42.342 --> 00:06:43.307
ran away from 11 homes.

112
00:06:43.443 --> 00:06:44.575
got into a lot of fights.

113
00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:45.979
Then I was abducted
by a wizard

114
00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:47.373
who gave me superpowers

115
00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:49.148
and then dude just. like.
died in front of my face.

116
00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:50.348
That's not a small amount.

117
00:06:50.484 --> 00:06:51.713
A doctor conjured seven demons

118
00:06:51.848 --> 00:06:53.113
and held my whole family
hostage.

119
00:06:53.248 --> 00:06:54.651
so we had to rip out
one of his eyeballs.

120
00:06:54.786 --> 00:06:56.316
and then everybody
got superpowers.

121
00:06:56.452 --> 00:06:58.186
but now everyone's kind of.
like. doing their own thing

122
00:06:58.322 --> 00:06:59.889
and I'm the only one trying
to keep everybody together.

123
00:07:00.024 --> 00:07:02.889
Okay. okay.
Well. let's just process that.

124
00:07:03.025 --> 00:07:05.526
Right?
Rejected by your parents.

125
00:07:05.662 --> 00:07:07.029
then by the system.

126
00:07:07.164 --> 00:07:09.767
and now rejected by a city
you try to protect.

127
00:07:09.902 --> 00:07:11.802
I never said I was rejected
by my city.

128
00:07:13.538 --> 00:07:14.971

00:18:14.963 --> 00:18:17.430
doesn't mean he's gonna
leave you like your mom.

358
00:18:17.566 --> 00:18:19.368
Or me wanting to go to college

359
00:18:19.504 --> 00:18:21.002
means I'm abandoning
the family.

360
00:18:21.137 --> 00:18:22.472
Oh. Okay. cool.

361
00:18:22.608 --> 00:18:24.609
it's about college again.
I totally get it.

362
00:18:24.744 --> 00:18:25.671
Yeah.

363
00:18:25.807 --> 00:18:27.611
Do you really
not see yourself?

364
00:18:27.747 --> 00:18:28.742
[sighs]

365
00:18:34.582 --> 00:18:36.114
You turn 18 in five months.

366
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.283
They're not gonna kick me out.
They didn't kick you out.

367
00:18:38.418 --> 00:18:41.126
Victor and Rosa
are saints. yes.
but you're about to age out

368
00:18:41.262 --> 00:18:42.854
of the foster system
just like I did.

369
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.860
Yeah. I get it.
I know how it works. okay?

370
00:18:45.996 --> 00:18:47.200
Do you?

371
00:18:48.302 --> 00:18:50.634
Victor and Rosa
can barely pay rent.

372
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.569
And the state no longer sends
checks to feed or house me

373
00:18:53.704 --> 00:18:55.934
and soon there will be
no checks for you.

374
00:18:57.037 --> 00:19:00.406
I don't care if Wonder Woman
has a job.

375
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:02.144
I want to contribute.

376
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.843
At some point. Billy. like

377
00:19:03.979 --> 00:19:06.615
everyone on Earth.
we have to get a job or...

378
00:19:07.216 --> 00:19:08.419
leave home.

379
00:19:14.357 --> 00:19:15.822
Nothing lasts forever.

[door opens. closes]

381
00:19:24.099 --> 00:19:27.768
I mean. it's literally called
the Rock of Eternity.

382
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.739
So. clearly. some things
do last forever.

[magic resonating]

388
00:20:26.327 --> 00:20:27.326
Magic.

389
00:20:27.461 --> 00:20:29.235
Impossible.

390
00:20:29.371 --> 00:20:31.437
This realm was sealed off
from magic.

391
00:20:31.572 --> 00:20:36.173
Yes. After you ripped it
from our father's very core.

392
00:20:36.309 --> 00:20:39.006
From every god in this realm.

393
00:20:39.142 --> 00:20:40.405
From me.

394
00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:43.248
[bar sizzling]

395
00:20:43.383 --> 00:20:45.479
Do you not remember
what you took?

396
00:20:45.615 --> 00:20:48.448
What my particular power was?

397
00:20:48.583 --> 00:20:50.851
The power of elements.

398
00:20:50.986 --> 00:20:54.587
No. I cast a barrier
to prevent your kind

399
00:20:54.723 --> 00:20:56.594
from entering the human realm.

400
00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.996
The only way that barrier
could be removed is if--

401
00:20:59.132 --> 00:21:00.663
Someone broke this?

402
00:21:02.331 --> 00:21:03.529
How did...

403
00:21:03.664 --> 00:21:05.197
Where is the Champion?

404
00:21:05.333 --> 00:21:08.106
It was your hands that forged
this staff for our father

405
00:21:08.241 --> 00:21:10.409
and yours that will mend it.

406
00:21:10.544 --> 00:21:13.874
I told you
I would die before I help you.

Now. say the word.

Never. Never!

411
00:21:37.432 --> 00:21:39.097
Never say never.

412
00:21:46.409 --> 00:21:48.111

No. don't be sorry. I'm sorry!

No. it's totally my fault.
Are you okay?

[clears throat]
Yeah. absolutely

437
00:23:11.996 --> 00:23:13.666
is what I meant to say.
Voice crack. It's weird.

438
00:23:13.801 --> 00:23:15.093
Oh. no. no worries. If it
makes you feel any better

439
00:23:15.228 --> 00:23:16.533
it's nothing compared
to the amount

440
00:23:16.668 --> 00:23:17.798
that you're blushing
right now.

441
00:23:17.934 --> 00:23:19.096
Oh. I blush
when I'm confident.

Sure I do. I don't belong
in that trash can.

were gonna hit you.

That's how I amuse myself.

You gonna walk me to class.
or what?

485
00:24:44.889 --> 00:24:46.018
Why would I...
Walk you to class? No.

486
00:24:46.153 --> 00:24:48.357
Why would I wanna do that?
Yes!

487
00:24:48.492 --> 00:24:49.991
Thanks. [chuckles]

488
00:24:50.626 --> 00:24:51.991

What is Thundercrack's
Make-A-Wish kid?

490
00:24:55.297 --> 00:24:59.231
Yeah. Um. it's real inside
baseball. but basically.

to have some lunch

Wait. the kid who's friends
with superheroes.

-That was you?
-Yeah.

495
00:25:08.548 --> 00:25:10.044
And they're still dicks
to you?

496
00:25:10.179 --> 00:25:11.650
Sadly. just 'cause
you know someone cool.

497
00:25:11.785 --> 00:25:13.978
doesn't really necessarily
make you cool.

498
00:25:14.113 --> 00:25:15.786
You seem pretty cool to me.

I'm just not sure

529

that I'm really ready
to commit right now. you know.

530
00:26:59.322 --> 00:27:01.687
Wait. wait. wait.
No. this isn't about you.

531
00:27:01.822 --> 00:27:06.326
I promise this is
not about you. Okay?
Look... [chuckles]

to see this happen.

00:27:08.631 --> 00:27:09.999
You and me.

534
00:27:10.134 --> 00:27:13.970
The dynamic duo.
The hottie goddies. [chuckles]

535
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.806
She-zam.

536
00:27:16.942 --> 00:27:19.105
I guess I'm just afraid
that I'm...

537
00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.879
gonna let 'em all down.
You know?

538
00:27:23.176 --> 00:27:24.409
That I'm gonna let you down.

539
00:27:29.185 --> 00:27:31.456
You know what?
Screw it. Let's try.

540
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:32.956
Let's try this crazy thing.

541
00:27:33.987 --> 00:27:35.189
Maybe we'll. uh...

542
00:27:37.728 --> 00:27:39.124
seal it with a kiss?

543
00:27:39.259 --> 00:27:41.459
[sentimental piano music
playing]

544
00:27:52.977 --> 00:27:54.413
-Billy Batson!
-[Shazam screams]

545
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:56.440
You are a fool of a champion.

546
00:27:56.576 --> 00:27:58.750
What the hell...
What the hell is going on?

547
00:27:58.885 --> 00:28:00.114
What happened
to her beautiful face?

548
00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.786
Also. aren't you.
like. dead-ass dead?

549
00:28:01.922 --> 00:28:03.987
I bring a warning
from beyond your realm.

550
00:28:04.122 --> 00:28:05.983
The daughters of Atlas
are coming for you.

551
00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:07.219
Daughters of Atlas?

552
00:28:07.354 --> 00:28:08.793
They're coming to unmake
your world

553
00:28:08.928 --> 00:28:11.557
and torture mankind
for all eternity

554
00:28:11.693 --> 00:28:14.567
-in the Pit of Endless Agony.
-Okay. I feel like maybe

555
00:28:14.702 --> 00:28:15.664
I should be writing
all this down.

556
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.865
-Quiet!
-Okay. okay.

557
00:28:17.001 --> 00:28:18.833
You don't know
what you've done.

558
00:28:18.968 --> 00:28:20.865
I regret ever choosing you.

559
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.435
Because of you.

560
00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.676
the barrier between the world
has been brought down.

561
00:28:24.812 --> 00:28:26.344
They will be hunting
for you now.

562
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.472
Hunting your family.

563
00:28:30.516 --> 00:28:31.784
[Shazam] Hmm?

564
00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:34.687
Oh. they're coming.
Listen to me. Billy.

565
00:28:34.822 --> 00:28:37.051
The fate of your world
depends on it.

566
00:28:37.187 --> 00:28:39.317
One thing you absolutely
must not allow

567
00:28:39.453 --> 00:28:41.756
the daughters of Atlas
to do is...

568
00:28:41.891 --> 00:28:43.455
-[screams]
-[gasps]

569
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.768

Hey. Freddy?

-[dog barking in distance]

[sighs]

575
00:29:14.894 --> 00:29:18.326
[Freddy] Nope. over it.
Done it.

576
00:29:18.461 --> 00:29:21.097
Check fraud? What.
are you kidding me? [gasps]

577
00:29:21.798 --> 00:29:23.330
Armored car heist?

578
00:29:23.465 --> 00:29:25.799
[chuckles] I think I got that
in the bag.

579
00:29:25.935 --> 00:29:27.705
[rock music playing]

580
00:29:27.841 --> 00:29:29.875
-Shazam!
-[lightning cracks]

581
00:29:35.381 --> 00:29:36.376
Whoo!

582
00:29:37.043 --> 00:29:38.246
[Freddy scoffs]

583
00:29:39.782 --> 00:29:41.183
Bon appetit.

584
00:29:42.553 --> 00:29:43.789
Hi.

585
00:29:43.925 --> 00:29:46.491
-Oh. hi! Yes. I mean. hi.
-Hi. [chuckles]

586
00:29:46.626 --> 00:29:47.893
Um. you wanna show me

587
00:29:48.028 --> 00:29:50.027
where you were sitting
when it happened?

588
00:29:51.996 --> 00:29:53.292
Oh. yeah. of course. Totally.

589
00:29:53.427 --> 00:29:55.164
-Yeah. Follow me.
-Okay. yeah.

590
00:29:55.299 --> 00:29:57.600
So. basically.
it's a table down at the end.

591
00:29:57.736 --> 00:29:59.938
[people chattering]

592
00:30:01.741 --> 00:30:03.173
So I was sitting. yeah...

593
00:30:03.309 --> 00:30:05.706
Basically. I was sitting
right here. and he was sitting

594
00:30:05.841 --> 00:30:07.076
right there.

595
00:30:07.212 --> 00:30:08.173
-Here? [chuckles]
-Right there. yeah.

596
00:30:08.309 --> 00:30:10.177
[cell phone vibrates. chimes]

597
00:30:10.312 --> 00:30:11.882
Oh. sorry.
Overbearing brother.

598
00:30:12.018 --> 00:30:13.948
Oh. I have one of those.
Uh. a sister.

599
00:30:14.084 --> 00:30:15.148
Always has to know where I am.

600
00:30:15.283 --> 00:30:16.447
-Right.
-[cell phone chiming]

601
00:30:16.583 --> 00:30:17.921
-I feel that. clearly.
-[chuckles]

602
00:30:18.057 --> 00:30:19.453
Always thinks she knows
better. too.

603
00:30:19.588 --> 00:30:21.124
Even when it's been
factually proven otherwise?

604
00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.754
Exactly. And it's not
that I don't love her.

605
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.159
No. of course. It'd just be
nice not to have someone--

606
00:30:25.295 --> 00:30:26.891
Constantly breathing
down your neck.

607
00:30:27.027 --> 00:30:28.933
-From the moment you wake up!
-'Cause I'm not a kid anymore.

608
00:30:29.069 --> 00:30:31.300
No! I'm a month younger.
one month exactly.

609
00:30:31.435 --> 00:30:33.305
And do we have to do
every single thing together?

610
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.202
[both] No!

611
00:30:35.338 --> 00:30:37.475
-[both chuckle]
-[footsteps approaching]

612
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.609
Oh! Billy! What...

613
00:30:39.745 --> 00:30:41.010
What a coinkidink! Um...

614
00:30:41.146 --> 00:30:43.014
I was just telling
my friend Anne

615
00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:45.917
-what a great guy you are.
-We need to talk.

616
00:30:46.052 --> 00:30:47.379
We need to talk.
This guy loves to talk.

617
00:30:47.514 --> 00:30:49.252
-He's a great talker.
-Freddy.

618
00:30:49.388 --> 00:30:51.990
-I have to talk to him.
I'll be right back.
-Okay.

619
00:30:53.425 --> 00:30:55.627
Wait. didn't you tell us
the wizard disintegrated?

620
00:30:55.763 --> 00:30:56.894
The skin peeled off his face.

621
00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.764
He turned into a literal
pile of ash.

622
00:30:58.899 --> 00:31:00.898
-Yeah. seems definitive.
-I dunno.

623
00:31:01.034 --> 00:31:04.068
Yeah. Except now
he's in my dreams

624
00:31:04.203 --> 00:31:05.631
and. Freddy. he's trying
to give me a message.

625
00:31:05.767 --> 00:31:07.267
[snaps fingers] Could be
astral projection powers.

626
00:31:07.403 --> 00:31:09.502
-What's that?
-Obi-Wan Kenobi-ing you

627
00:31:09.637 --> 00:31:11.337
-from the great beyond?
-That's it. I'm calling

628
00:31:11.473 --> 00:31:13.011
an emergency meeting
after school.

629
00:31:13.147 --> 00:31:15.007
-I want you there.
-Where else am I gonna go?

630
00:31:15.143 --> 00:31:16.307
-What?
-Dude.

631
00:31:16.443 --> 00:31:18.412
[Freddy reading indistinctly]

632
00:31:18.547 --> 00:31:20.679
Okay. first of all.
I didn't explode it!

633
00:31:20.814 --> 00:31:22.350
All right? It was already
like that and. and. and...

634
00:31:22.485 --> 00:31:23.919
What is that. the<i> Tribune?</i>
It's fake news!

635
00:31:24.055 --> 00:31:25.556
Freddy. we only have one rule.

636
00:31:25.692 --> 00:31:26.858
[both] All or none.

637
00:31:26.994 --> 00:31:28.190
And it's a stupid rule.
by the way.

638
00:31:28.325 --> 00:31:29.895
I have a girl talking
to me. Billy.

639
00:31:30.031 --> 00:31:31.559
A girl. For the first time
in my life!

640
00:31:31.695 --> 00:31:33.729
And I probably don't have
a shot in hell with this girl.

641
00:31:33.865 --> 00:31:35.298
but I'll never find out

642
00:31:35.433 --> 00:31:36.767
if you keep trying to control
everything I wanna do!

643
00:31:36.902 --> 00:31:38.129
Just be at the Rock. Freddy.

644
00:31:38.264 --> 00:31:41.202
[sighs] Okay. Mmm.

645
00:31:41.337 --> 00:31:43.607
By the way. uh.
she has a sister.

646
00:31:43.743 --> 00:31:45.007
Total control freak.

647
00:31:45.142 --> 00:31:46.405
I think you guys
would get along.

648
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:48.307
Think you'd love her.
actually.

649
00:31:48.442 --> 00:31:49.679
[Shazam]<i> Look. look. look. Fam.</i>

650
00:31:49.815 --> 00:31:51.113
I know it sounds crazy.

651
00:31:51.248 --> 00:31:52.882
And. and obviously
I don't know

652
00:31:53.017 --> 00:31:54.884
exactly what this all means

653
00:31:55.019 --> 00:31:56.518
but. but he was super aggro

654
00:31:56.654 --> 00:31:58.657
and super loud and he was
trying to warn us. I think.

655
00:31:58.793 --> 00:32:00.091
He was yelling about all this

656
00:32:00.226 --> 00:32:01.693
wizard-y mumbo-jumbo
about realms and stuff.

657
00:32:01.828 --> 00:32:04.227
Do you have to talk so loud?

658
00:32:04.362 --> 00:32:06.024
Yeah. Mary. 'cause this is not
that loud.

659
00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:09.065
I think this is
a perfectly acceptable
indoor voice volume.

660
00:32:09.201 --> 00:32:10.464
What is the deal?
Are you okay?

661
00:32:10.599 --> 00:32:13.500
-Yeah.
-Why do you have
sunglasses on?

662
00:32:13.635 --> 00:32:15.037
Did you go to the eye doctor
this morning?

663
00:32:15.173 --> 00:32:16.737
-[snorts]
-[Shazam chuckles]

664
00:32:16.872 --> 00:32:19.374
I dunno. it looks to me like
Mary did go to the eye doctor.

665
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.211
but it was last night.
and she had a lot of fun.

666
00:32:22.347 --> 00:32:25.249
In point of fact.
I did have a great time.

667
00:32:25.384 --> 00:32:28.216
I met other people my age
and I enjoyed myself.

668
00:32:28.351 --> 00:32:30.686
You made friends
at the eye doctor?

669
00:32:30.821 --> 00:32:32.121
No. she...

670
00:32:32.257 --> 00:32:33.757
Yeah. can we get back
on track?

671
00:32:33.893 --> 00:32:35.257
Listen. he's yelling at me

672
00:32:35.393 --> 00:32:37.255
and he's saying the daughters
of Atlas

673
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.225
are coming to hunt us.

674
00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.592
So. check out what I found.

675
00:32:40.728 --> 00:32:42.260
"The daughters of Atlas
are the offspring

676
00:32:42.395 --> 00:32:43.700
of the Titan Atlas..."

677
00:32:43.835 --> 00:32:45.203
which is obvious.

678
00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:49.304
but also Nyx. the Goddess
of Night and Death.

679
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.842
Well. good things
can happen at night.

680
00:32:51.977 --> 00:32:53.577
-And death.
-[sighs]

681
00:32:53.712 --> 00:32:55.240
Let me see this.

682
00:32:55.376 --> 00:32:57.577
[intriguing music playing]

683
00:33:00.385 --> 00:33:03.288
"The daughters
guard the mythic Tree of Life

00:33:03.424 --> 00:33:07.056
which grows golden apples
that contain the seeds of life

00:33:07.191 --> 00:33:09.022
which gave birth
to their realm

-dragon."
-Hey. now.

688
00:33:13.628 --> 00:33:14.862
And I am suddenly here
for this.

689
00:33:14.998 --> 00:33:16.366
I know. right?

690
00:33:16.501 --> 00:33:17.695
'Cause. like. on one hand.
totally terrifying.

-On the other hand. dragon!
-Dragon!

00:33:19.872 --> 00:33:21.304
Mary. What are we doin'?

693
00:33:21.439 --> 00:33:23.935
I don't know. man.
This is your meeting.

694
00:33:24.071 --> 00:33:26.809
Right. yes. fine. but we all
need to be on the same page

695
00:33:26.945 --> 00:33:28.410
and. and. and look.

696
00:33:28.545 --> 00:33:31.076
I often think that you think
better than me.

697
00:33:31.212 --> 00:33:34.846
The wizard
did not exactly give me
a tutorial here. guys. okay?

698
00:33:34.981 --> 00:33:37.121
Like. I don't know
how a lot of this stuff works.

699
00:33:37.256 --> 00:33:38.985
That. that room of doors.
or that violin

700
00:33:39.121 --> 00:33:41.719
that is. like.
constantly burning
which is super weird but also

701
00:33:41.855 --> 00:33:43.359
definitely keeps
the lair cozy. right?

702
00:33:43.494 --> 00:33:46.426
He didn't even tell me
my superhero name.

703
00:33:46.561 --> 00:33:48.693
And it's not like
I'm not tryin'.

704
00:33:48.828 --> 00:33:51.400
But I really.
really need your help.

705
00:33:52.601 --> 00:33:56.405
Uh. I might know somebody
that can help.

706
00:34:01.276 --> 00:34:03.207
Shut up. That lights up?

707
00:34:03.342 --> 00:34:05.449
[rumbling]

708
00:34:05.585 --> 00:34:07.581
Shut up.

709
00:34:14.862 --> 00:34:16.854
[enchanting music playing]

710
00:34:40.352 --> 00:34:42.149
So. I'm mapping out
the entire lair

711
00:34:42.284 --> 00:34:43.717
and you withhold this?

712
00:34:43.852 --> 00:34:44.821
[Shazam] And you have really
been holding out on us.

713
00:34:44.956 --> 00:34:45.883
Jeez Louise. dude.

714
00:34:48.194 --> 00:34:50.160
-Whoa!
-[Shazam] "Whoa" what?

715
00:34:50.296 --> 00:34:51.691
-"Whoa" what?
-[superhero Darla] Look!

716
00:34:51.826 --> 00:34:53.528
-[superhero Darla chuckles]
-Hey. Steve.

717
00:34:54.631 --> 00:34:56.827
[chuckles] What?
You call the pen "Steve"?

718
00:34:56.963 --> 00:34:58.600
Yeah. I thought he looked
like a "Steve."

719
00:34:58.736 --> 00:35:00.601
[superhero Darla] He totally
looks like a "Steve."

720
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:05.942
-"'Crime and Punishment.'
a book report by Pedro Pena?"
-Yeah.

721
00:35:06.078 --> 00:35:08.313
-[Shazam laughs]
-Pedro.

722
00:35:08.449 --> 00:35:11.279
-Dude. that's cheating.
-I mean. he knows everything.

723
00:35:11.414 --> 00:35:13.885
-Hmm.
-Seriously. Ask him.

724
00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.319
You can just ask him stuff?

725
00:35:15.454 --> 00:35:16.681
-Pretty much.
-[Shazam] Slick. Okay. cool.

726
00:35:16.817 --> 00:35:19.451
Steve. we're looking
for information

727
00:35:19.587 --> 00:35:21.488
about the daughters of Atlas.

728
00:35:21.624 --> 00:35:23.822
Can you please help us
with that?

729
00:35:30.864 --> 00:35:32.732
-These are book titles.
-[Shazam] Okay.

730
00:35:32.867 --> 00:35:34.337
Let's just all pick a book.
or something.

731
00:35:34.473 --> 00:35:36.907
Where's Freddy?
I mean. obscure mythology?

732
00:35:37.042 --> 00:35:38.575
Definitely his thing.

733
00:35:38.711 --> 00:35:41.543
I'm not even sure Freddy knows
what his thing is anymore.

734
00:35:42.982 --> 00:35:45.184
[people chattering]

735
00:35:46.817 --> 00:35:49.079
You know I've actually never.
never been up here.

736
00:35:49.214 --> 00:35:51.618
Don't lie. [chuckles]
This is where you hang out

737
00:35:51.754 --> 00:35:53.891
with your superhero friends.
isn't it?

738
00:35:54.027 --> 00:35:56.360
No. actually. why would
they ever have to...
Why would they ever come here?

739
00:35:56.495 --> 00:35:58.129
I mean they have. yes.
they've driven by...

740
00:35:58.265 --> 00:35:59.859
Do you actually know
those guys?

741
00:35:59.995 --> 00:36:03.167
Or is this like
a "Canadian girlfriend"
situation?

742
00:36:03.303 --> 00:36:04.399
Oh. you mean Collette?
Well. she and I

743
00:36:04.534 --> 00:36:06.132
aren't really exclusive.
as of now.

744
00:36:06.267 --> 00:36:07.503
[chuckles]

745
00:36:09.571 --> 00:36:10.770
Do you wanna meet one of them?

746
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:12.405
Meet. like how?

747
00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:14.246
Like. face-to-face. right now.

748
00:36:15.181 --> 00:36:16.343
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

749
00:36:16.478 --> 00:36:17.643
And today is your lucky day.

750
00:36:17.779 --> 00:36:19.878
because I'm gonna call
the hot one.

751
00:36:20.786 --> 00:36:22.053
Her?

752
00:36:22.189 --> 00:36:23.816
-No. the male hot one.
-Him?

753
00:36:24.989 --> 00:36:26.424
What? Him?

754
00:36:26.559 --> 00:36:28.118
Look. I mean. it's all
subjective. right? But. um...

755
00:36:28.253 --> 00:36:30.421
Captain Everypower usually
tops most online polls

756
00:36:30.557 --> 00:36:32.291
so... It's no big deal.

757
00:36:32.427 --> 00:36:34.127
Is this a joke. Freddy?

758
00:36:34.263 --> 00:36:37.434
'Cause I didn't mean
to make you
actually prove it. really.

759
00:36:40.637 --> 00:36:42.099
No. it's not a joke.
And I'm gonna

760
00:36:42.235 --> 00:36:44.142
call him right now.
I'm gonna call him right now.

761
00:36:44.278 --> 00:36:47.277
So. don't move.
So. stay right there.

762
00:36:47.413 --> 00:36:49.310
Hey. Captain Everypower.
What's goin' on?

763
00:36:49.445 --> 00:36:51.942
It's your boy Freddy. Yeah.

764
00:36:52.077 --> 00:36:53.314
Remember that time
I saved your life?

765
00:36:53.449 --> 00:36:54.652
No. no. no. the other time.

766
00:36:54.787 --> 00:36:55.846
Yeah.

767
00:36:55.982 --> 00:36:58.719
Well. I'm calling in
that favor.

768
00:37:01.455 --> 00:37:03.927
[lightning cracks]

769
00:37:04.063 --> 00:37:05.858
[heroic music plays]

770
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.097
You must be Anne.

771
00:37:09.233 --> 00:37:12.029
[gasps] Oh. my God.

772
00:37:13.304 --> 00:37:14.766
Friend of Freddy's. I hear.

773
00:37:14.902 --> 00:37:17.969
I am. actually. Yeah.
How are you...

774
00:37:20.945 --> 00:37:23.814
[sighs] You know. I may be
the one with the superpowers.

775
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:24.948
but that kid.

776
00:37:25.084 --> 00:37:26.378
he's the real hero.

777
00:37:26.514 --> 00:37:28.483
Yeah. I mean. honestly.

778
00:37:28.619 --> 00:37:30.216
I've never met anyone
like him.

779
00:37:30.351 --> 00:37:32.518
He's... genuine

780
00:37:32.654 --> 00:37:35.325
and warm and funny. [chuckles]

781
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:37.362
-That's a lot of nice things.
-Yeah.

782
00:37:39.098 --> 00:37:40.292
How did you two meet?

783
00:37:40.427 --> 00:37:41.429
Comic Con.

784
00:37:41.564 --> 00:37:43.433
-What's Comic Con?
-What?

785
00:37:43.569 --> 00:37:44.696
[superhero Mary]
<i> According to this.</i>

786
00:37:44.832 --> 00:37:47.168
gods considered
humans servants.

787
00:37:47.304 --> 00:37:49.104
toys to be played with.

788
00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.771
children to be punished.

789
00:37:52.541 --> 00:37:53.973
[chuckles] Thanks. Steve.

790
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:56.610
Until the rebellion when
the humans turned on the gods.

791
00:37:56.746 --> 00:37:58.313
I'm reading about that
right now.

792
00:37:58.448 --> 00:37:59.844
So. apparently. all of this

793
00:37:59.979 --> 00:38:02.150
revolves around
a powerful weapon.

794
00:38:02.286 --> 00:38:03.948
So Atlas. uh. the father

795
00:38:04.084 --> 00:38:06.183
of the daughters of Atlas.
obviously. yeah.

796
00:38:06.318 --> 00:38:08.087
he crafted a quarterstaff
from the Tree of Life

797
00:38:08.223 --> 00:38:10.824
and he used that staff to
give powers to certain deities

798
00:38:10.959 --> 00:38:13.764
but also to take powers away
from others.

799
00:38:13.899 --> 00:38:17.194
So. the staff's where Atlas
stored all supernatural power.

800
00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:21.268
Yes. exactly. It's like a.
a battery for magic.

801
00:38:21.404 --> 00:38:22.804
But when things got bad.

802
00:38:22.939 --> 00:38:25.769
a council of human wizards
got together and they

803
00:38:25.904 --> 00:38:27.345
stole the staff from Atlas.

804
00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:29.043
And they used that to take
his powers away.

805
00:38:29.178 --> 00:38:30.578
And once they had his magic
they went after other gods...

806
00:38:30.714 --> 00:38:32.184
Guys. that's the wizard!
I know this guy.

807
00:38:32.319 --> 00:38:34.116
this is the wizard
that I know!

808
00:38:34.251 --> 00:38:35.585
What do these say?

809
00:38:41.061 --> 00:38:42.119
"The Wisdom of Solomon.

810
00:38:42.254 --> 00:38:43.789
Strength of Hercules.
Stamina of Atlas.

811
00:38:43.925 --> 00:38:45.563
Power of Zeus.
Courage of Achilles.

812
00:38:45.699 --> 00:38:48.125
Speed of Mercury." These are
the powers they stole.

813
00:38:49.363 --> 00:38:50.567
No.

814
00:38:52.434 --> 00:38:53.368
Whoa. guys. look!

815
00:38:53.503 --> 00:38:54.902
This is what the name means.

816
00:38:55.037 --> 00:38:56.540
Which is way cooler
than what I thought it was.

817
00:38:56.675 --> 00:38:58.370
which is just a bunch
of hot garbage. so.

818
00:38:58.506 --> 00:39:01.845
If I may point out one
of the powers
that may be possibly MIA.

819
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.277
Boop.

820
00:39:03.413 --> 00:39:04.379
[Shazam] I'm sorry.

821
00:39:04.515 --> 00:39:06.284
are you very unsubtly implying

822
00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.053
that I somehow lack
the wisdom of

823
00:39:09.189 --> 00:39:11.049
-Solo Man?
-Yeah.

824
00:39:11.851 --> 00:39:13.557
Well. maybe it comes later.

825
00:39:13.692 --> 00:39:15.555
I mean you do usually ask Mary
what to do.

826
00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:16.622
-I'm just saying.
-Yeah.

827
00:39:16.757 --> 00:39:17.922
This is very. very hurtful.

828
00:39:18.058 --> 00:39:19.295
I just want you all
to know that.

829
00:39:19.431 --> 00:39:20.693
And it's pronounced "Solomon."

830
00:39:20.828 --> 00:39:22.267
-Oh.
-[Shazam clears throat]

831
00:39:22.403 --> 00:39:23.865
What else
have we learned. fam?

832
00:39:24.001 --> 00:39:28.232
Well. once the staff contained
the powers of the gods.

833
00:39:28.367 --> 00:39:32.943
the wizards apparently
encased the God Realm in some

834
00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:35.045
magical sphere

835
00:39:35.181 --> 00:39:36.948
sealing it away forever.

836
00:39:37.084 --> 00:39:38.943
Cut off from magic.

837
00:39:39.078 --> 00:39:41.047
Oh. so that's what
that was about.

838
00:39:41.182 --> 00:39:44.687
Yeah. I don't think that
they are so cut off anymore.

839
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.658

00:39:50.524 --> 00:39:52.558
<i> Two women dressed in what</i>
<i> appears to be ancient Greek...</i>

842
00:39:52.693 --> 00:39:54.631
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
that's the wizard's staff.
How did they get that?

843
00:39:54.766 --> 00:39:56.293
So. all those statues
used to be people.

844
00:39:56.428 --> 00:40:00.499
I'm wondering. how did
the staff end up in Europe.

845
00:40:00.635 --> 00:40:01.935
where Greece is at?

846
00:40:03.335 --> 00:40:06.978
Oh. gee-whiz. mister.
sorry I took your cane.

847
00:40:07.113 --> 00:40:08.139
You want it back?

848
00:40:11.785 --> 00:40:13.816
I mean. I did break it in half
and then throw it away.

849
00:40:13.951 --> 00:40:16.285
So. that's probably
where the journey started.

850
00:40:16.421 --> 00:40:17.553
-You know?
-What?

851
00:40:17.689 --> 00:40:18.952
What do you mean.
"What?" What?

852
00:40:19.087 --> 00:40:20.691
-You just left it there?
-We were all there.

853
00:40:20.826 --> 00:40:22.655
Guys. I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers.

854
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.289
You're welcome. by the way.

855
00:40:24.425 --> 00:40:25.792
And then I had to break it
in half so Sivana didn't do

856
00:40:25.928 --> 00:40:27.999
super bad-guy stuff with it.
okay?

857
00:40:28.135 --> 00:40:29.259
You broke the staff.

858
00:40:29.394 --> 00:40:31.398
meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds.

859
00:40:31.533 --> 00:40:32.667
Which we now know.

860
00:40:32.803 --> 00:40:34.397
We also now know
what they look like.

861
00:40:34.533 --> 00:40:36.437
so when they come to hunt us.
we'll see those two

-coming a--
-Three.

863
00:40:37.636 --> 00:40:38.840
What?

00:40:40.445 --> 00:40:42.211

871
00:40:58.999 --> 00:41:00.125
I sense...

872
00:41:01.294 --> 00:41:03.764
that you may have feelings
for Freddy.

873
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.999

when he's coming back.

is that there's five of us
and three of them.

1052
00:49:51.793 --> 00:49:54.461
So I think we should
send them a little invitation.

1053
00:49:56.865 --> 00:49:57.867
Okay.

1054
00:49:58.003 --> 00:49:59.937
So. Steve says that this paper

1055
00:50:00.073 --> 00:50:02.106
is a stack
of magical parchment.

1056
00:50:02.241 --> 00:50:03.869
You write a message
on the magical paper

1057
00:50:04.004 --> 00:50:07.076
and say the name of the god
that you would like to talk to

1058
00:50:07.211 --> 00:50:09.745
and then the paper folds
into a...

1059
00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:12.413
[gasps] Oh. my God. yes!

1060
00:50:13.686 --> 00:50:14.981
A paper bird.

1061
00:50:15.117 --> 00:50:16.516
And it flies to the god.

1062
00:50:16.652 --> 00:50:18.455
[Super Hero Eugene] Well.
that's kinda cute.

1063
00:50:18.591 --> 00:50:22.523
Hey. what about demigods? Uh.
you know. like. Wonder Woman?

1064
00:50:22.658 --> 00:50:25.261
Do you think she's accepting
bird letters right now?

1065
00:50:27.195 --> 00:50:28.528
Did the pen just shrug?

1066
00:50:29.663 --> 00:50:31.630
Hey. Steve. do I just
dictate to...

1067
00:50:32.565 --> 00:50:34.430
I do. Okay. cool. wad that up.

1068
00:50:34.566 --> 00:50:36.107
All right. [clears throat]

1069
00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:39.043
Letter...

1070
00:50:39.179 --> 00:50:43.011
Letter. writing a letter.
No. no. no!

1071
00:50:43.146 --> 00:50:44.645
I was just talking out loud.

1072
00:50:44.781 --> 00:50:46.183
That's not a part
of the letter.
Wad that up. too.

1073
00:50:47.351 --> 00:50:49.283
[superhero Darla]
Maybe if you try

1074
00:50:49.419 --> 00:50:51.381
-speaking from the heart.
-Hmm.

1075
00:50:51.517 --> 00:50:53.586
"Dear daughters of Atlas.

1076
00:50:54.487 --> 00:50:56.419
violence is not the answer."

[Hespera] Child.

1081
00:51:20.012 --> 00:51:22.111
I will spare your life
if you're honest with me.

1082
00:51:22.247 --> 00:51:23.550
Honesty.

1083
00:51:23.685 --> 00:51:27.554
Yeah. wow. very. um.
ironic subject choice.

1084
00:51:28.256 --> 00:51:29.355
The other Champions...

1085
00:51:29.491 --> 00:51:31.894
are they children
like yourself?

1086
00:51:32.029 --> 00:51:33.593
What even is a child?

1087
00:51:33.728 --> 00:51:36.666
I mean. I know I shave.
like. every week-ish.

1088
00:51:36.801 --> 00:51:38.061
Yes or no?

1089
00:51:38.196 --> 00:51:40.404
No. Your answer is no
because nobody's stupid enough

1090
00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.868
to grant primordial god-like
powers to a bunch of kids.

1091
00:51:44.004 --> 00:51:47.270
-Give us their names.
-The names of the Champions?

1092
00:51:47.405 --> 00:51:51.642
Um. well. there's
Brett Breyer.
and. uh. Burke Breyer.

1093
00:51:51.777 --> 00:51:53.179
Are you guys taking
this stuff in?

1094
00:51:53.314 --> 00:51:54.784
Writing this down? No?

1095
00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:55.982
They drive a Dodge Ram.

1096
00:51:56.117 --> 00:51:57.219
He's lying.

1097
00:51:57.354 --> 00:51:59.619
That's your superpower.
not mine.

1098
00:51:59.754 --> 00:52:01.753
And she thinks
you're a total control freak.

1099
00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:03.858
One of you.

1100
00:52:03.994 --> 00:52:05.262
Probably you.

1101
00:52:06.096 --> 00:52:08.159
-[gasps]
-Hold him.

1102
00:52:08.294 --> 00:52:10.234
[soldier growls]

1103
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:12.465
[Freddy] Don't... [grunts]
What's happening?

1104
00:52:12.601 --> 00:52:13.934
What is that?
What's she doing?

1105
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:15.404
Power of chaos.

1106
00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.702
It enters a man's mind
and shatters it whole.

1107
00:52:17.837 --> 00:52:20.440
Oh. [chuckles]
My mind is already trash.

1108
00:52:20.576 --> 00:52:22.913
so I'd actually like
to see you try.

1109
00:52:23.048 --> 00:52:25.081
Because nobody has the balls

1110
00:52:25.216 --> 00:52:27.214
to handle what's
inside my brain.

1111
00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:29.414
[whispering] Say their names.

1112
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:31.248

[screaming continues]

1118
00:52:44.499 --> 00:52:47.465
Destiny's Child did it better.

1119
00:52:47.601 --> 00:52:49.003
He is stronger than he looks.

1121
00:52:51.274 --> 00:52:53.343

-Stop!

1125
00:53:07.121 --> 00:53:08.418
Stop.

00:53:08.554 --> 00:53:11.159
[breathing shakily]

1127
00:53:11.294 --> 00:53:12.857
This is from the Champions.

Oh. good first sentence.
Thanks. Darla.

-We'd like to make a trade.
-What?

We'll give up our powers

1133
00:53:25.641 --> 00:53:28.773
if you give us Freddy.
add 'unharmed.'

1134
00:53:28.909 --> 00:53:32.045
Otherwise. they're gonna
monkey's-paw you.

1135
00:53:32.181 --> 00:53:33.411
Smart. Eugene.

1136
00:53:33.546 --> 00:53:35.920
Steve. add 'unharmed'

1137

No. 'Sincerely. best'.

Maybe just signed
'The Champions.'

1140
00:53:44.161 --> 00:53:45.624
Should we proofread it?

1141
00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.030
Naw. Steve doesn't
make mistakes.

1142
00:53:48.166 --> 00:53:49.398
just writes what you say.

1143
00:53:49.534 --> 00:53:52.970
Great. I feel good
about this. Me. too.

1144

Anyone else want a Gatorade?

1145
00:53:56.072 --> 00:53:57.473
Do we have red?"

1146
00:53:58.406 --> 00:54:00.672

And we will meet. sister.

00:54:18.925 --> 00:54:20.596
But humans are not
to be trusted.

1155
00:54:20.731 --> 00:54:24.632
The pit is just a bad name
for a fun place. right?

1156
00:54:25.332 --> 00:54:27.437
Right? [grunts]

No. just worthless.

00:54:49.592 --> 00:54:51.858
-Well. you must get up.
-For what?

1163
00:54:51.993 --> 00:54:55.760
All this pretending
to be a superhero is just...

1164
00:54:55.896 --> 00:54:57.966
a way for me to pretend
I'm not broken.

1165
00:54:58.102 --> 00:54:59.898
Oh. feelings.

00:55:36.041 --> 00:55:37.268
What is that?

1175
00:55:37.403 --> 00:55:38.572
Ladon.

-You're okay! You're okay.

00:56:13.641 --> 00:56:15.278
I don't feel okay at all.

1185
00:56:15.413 --> 00:56:17.745
That's the power
of the dragon.

1186
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.943
It emanates fear
from every pore of its body.

1187
00:56:20.079 --> 00:56:22.245
Ladon's fear paralyzes
any mortal.

1188
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.950
so that none can approach
the garden it protects.

1189
00:56:25.984 --> 00:56:28.391
Power of axis. Very cool. very.

-very rare.
-[Hespera] Anthea!

00:56:30.459 --> 00:56:32.226
[Anthea] I must go.

1192
00:56:32.361 --> 00:56:35.328
The door back to your world
is at the center
of the labyrinth.

1193
00:56:35.463 --> 00:56:36.996
Right. left. left

1194
00:56:37.132 --> 00:56:39.667
and then follow
the right-hand wall
to the center.

1195
00:56:39.803 --> 00:56:41.504
-You'll need this.
-How did you find this?

1196
00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:43.206
You once protected me
from the bullies

1197
00:56:43.342 --> 00:56:45.308
in your world. Freddy Freeman.

1198
00:56:45.443 --> 00:56:46.840
Now I've protected you
in mine.

1199
00:56:51.744 --> 00:56:53.882
-Hero.
-[both chuckle]

1200
00:56:54.018 --> 00:56:57.013
Well. to be fair. I didn't
actually need your protection.

1201
00:56:57.149 --> 00:56:58.751
I was about to rearrange
those boys'

1202
00:56:58.887 --> 00:57:00.283
internal organs
when you stepped in.

1203
00:57:00.418 --> 00:57:02.988
But you didn't know that.
which does make you brave.

1204
00:57:03.123 --> 00:57:05.926
I was just brave because
I knew I had powers.

1205
00:57:06.061 --> 00:57:09.962
No. the most powerful thing
about you is you.

1206
00:57:11.769 --> 00:57:14.198
[clears throat] How lovely
for both of you.

1207
00:57:14.333 --> 00:57:16.706
Goddess. we thank you much.
but we must get--

1208
00:57:16.841 --> 00:57:19.541
You should go. My sisters
don't need you anymore.

1209
00:57:19.677 --> 00:57:21.479
All they require now
is the seed.

1210
00:57:22.281 --> 00:57:24.042
-The seed?
-Yes.

1211
00:57:24.177 --> 00:57:25.946
Which remains hidden
in a place unreachable

1212
00:57:26.081 --> 00:57:27.981
by any of their kind.
Come. come. Jeff. Faster.

1213
00:57:28.116 --> 00:57:30.582
You call me Jeff?
She just said my entire name!

1214
00:57:30.718 --> 00:57:33.722
[whimsical music playing]

1215
00:57:36.525 --> 00:57:38.727
[people chattering]

1216
00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:46.031
[Shazam] Hi. God... No?

1217
00:57:49.173 --> 00:57:51.234
Yo. Low Voltage.

1218
00:57:52.908 --> 00:57:54.675
When you fixing
this dome shit. man?

1219
00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:56.279
Oh. no. no. no.
don't worry. sir.

1220
00:57:56.415 --> 00:57:57.575
[clicks tongue] I have a plan.

1221
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:59.011
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

1222
00:57:59.146 --> 00:58:00.777
'Cause look like all you got
is a sandwich.

1223
00:58:00.912 --> 00:58:02.078
No. these sandwiches?

1224
00:58:02.214 --> 00:58:03.452
No. these sandwiches
are important.

1225
00:58:03.587 --> 00:58:04.885
They're. they're
for a meeting.

1226
00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:08.559
Yeah. sure.
Colonel Cheesesteak. [scoffs]

1227
00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:10.055
Colonel?

1228
00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:12.959
Oh. boy. I really need a name.

1229
00:58:14.563 --> 00:58:16.061
[dramatic chord plays]

1230
00:58:16.927 --> 00:58:18.495
Quiet one. she is.

1231
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:21.368
I find it the most effective
way to slit an enemy's throat.

1232
00:58:21.504 --> 00:58:23.039
[chuckles nervously]

1233
00:58:23.174 --> 00:58:24.474
Is that...

1234
00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:26.371
Oh. you're totally serious.
Okay.

1235
00:58:26.506 --> 00:58:27.942
Uh...

1236
00:58:28.077 --> 00:58:30.844
Right. so. look. here's
the thing. um. you're upset.

1237
00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.715
A bunch of wizards came
and stole your powers.

1238
00:58:32.851 --> 00:58:35.014
which totally sucks balls.
I totally get it.

1239
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:37.988
But. I kind of feel like
you're taking this all.

1240
00:58:38.124 --> 00:58:41.020
like. really personally
and. like. I don't even
know you. lady. right?

1241
00:58:41.155 --> 00:58:43.625
If thieves stormed your home
in the night

1242
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.762
and stole all your coin
and then fled.

1243
00:58:45.897 --> 00:58:48.566
you would naturally
give chase. would you not?

1244
00:58:49.701 --> 00:58:51.094
And say. in this pursuit
the thieves

1245
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:52.735
dropped the money
on the ground

1246
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:55.672
and your neighbor picked it up
and kept it.

1247
00:58:56.607 --> 00:58:59.168
Now. imagine it is not money.

1248
00:58:59.303 --> 00:59:01.609
but the lifeblood
of your father.

1249
00:59:01.744 --> 00:59:03.675
The last breath
of your mother.

1250
00:59:03.811 --> 00:59:06.013
The power of all the gods.

1251
00:59:06.148 --> 00:59:09.245
the magic of the entire realm
that was stolen.

1252
00:59:09.381 --> 00:59:12.189
And now this magic courses
through you.

1253
00:59:12.324 --> 00:59:13.886
and you have the gall

1254
00:59:14.021 --> 00:59:16.825
to believe
that you deserve it?

1255
00:59:18.594 --> 00:59:21.225
This is very personal.

1256
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.634
Billy.

1257
00:59:26.338 --> 00:59:28.101
You are very menacing.

1258
00:59:28.236 --> 00:59:30.337
I just want you to know that.
Like. I really...

1259
00:59:30.472 --> 00:59:34.107
I see the presence
that you have.
and that goes a long way.

1260
00:59:34.242 --> 00:59:37.776
But today. I really wanted
to talk about compromise.

1261
00:59:37.912 --> 00:59:39.747
[both] There is no compromise.

1262
00:59:39.883 --> 00:59:41.751
I knew you were gonna
say that.

1263
00:59:41.887 --> 00:59:44.049
Wisdom of Saruman.
Don't mess with me. okay?

1264
00:59:44.185 --> 00:59:46.720
Give us back Freddy.
you take down this

1265
00:59:46.856 --> 00:59:49.918
sphere-y dome-y
magic bowl thing

1266
00:59:50.054 --> 00:59:51.454
and then. you know.

1267
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:53.156
we won't have to annihilate
you into the ground.

1268
00:59:53.291 --> 00:59:54.593
-[scoffs]
-It's a good offer.

1269
00:59:54.728 --> 00:59:55.761
I'm being serious.

1270
00:59:55.896 --> 00:59:58.500
You play the part of a man.

1271
00:59:58.635 --> 01:00:00.864
but you do not play it well.

1272
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.641
Give us the powers. child.

1273
01:00:04.242 --> 01:00:05.704
All of them.

1274
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.876
You are no leader. Billy.

1275
01:00:08.676 --> 01:00:10.308
You are a lost boy

1276
01:00:10.443 --> 01:00:13.543
who likes to make-believe
that he's a warrior.

1277
01:00:13.679 --> 01:00:15.950
Okay. look. I might not have
as much experience as you

1278
01:00:16.085 --> 01:00:17.780
'cause I'm not. like.
super old like you.

1279
01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:21.016
but I think I have
a few experiences
that you don't have.

1280
01:00:21.152 --> 01:00:24.691
'Cause I've seen all of the
<i> Fast and the Furious</i> movies.
lady.

1281
01:00:24.827 --> 01:00:26.428
And let me tell you something.

1282
01:00:26.563 --> 01:00:29.528
It's all about family!

1283
01:00:29.664 --> 01:00:31.401

Family!

1286
01:00:37.003 --> 01:00:40.206
Guys. that was the signal.
We practiced this.
like. 12 times. Thank you.

1287
01:00:40.341 --> 01:00:42.779
Forgot all about my family.
didn't you. Goddess?

1288
01:00:43.782 --> 01:00:46.948
No. human.
You forgot about mine.

Yeah.

[Shazam] Whoo!

1310
01:02:19.141 --> 01:02:20.604
She sure didn't see
that coming

1311
01:02:20.739 --> 01:02:24.507
because she didn't go
to the eye doctor. [chuckles]

1312
01:02:24.642 --> 01:02:26.379
[Shazam] Uh. Darla.
that was. 'cause...

1313
01:02:26.515 --> 01:02:29.281
-[rattling]
-A euphemism.
That was a euphemism.

[Hespera] We've taken the power
from two

in your family already.

1318
01:02:54.111 --> 01:02:56.646
And now two more must die.
and for what?

1319
01:02:56.782 --> 01:02:59.074
So you can keep
playing soldier?

1325
01:03:35.587 --> 01:03:37.787
My father was Atlas.

1326
01:03:37.923 --> 01:03:41.023
Titan god of stamina
and strength.

1327
01:03:43.226 --> 01:03:46.092
His magic and power
may course through you.

1328
01:03:46.228 --> 01:03:49.392
but you will never
be a true god.

1329

have superspeed?

-[door closes]
-[chain locks]

1339
01:04:31.404 --> 01:04:32.668
You thought you were
just goin'

1340
01:04:32.803 --> 01:04:34.206
into some regular porta-potty.
didn't ya?

1341
01:04:34.342 --> 01:04:36.410
Which I can somehow
still smell.

1342
01:04:36.546 --> 01:04:38.746
Yeah. yeah. it really sticks
around. It's crazy. right?

1343
01:04:38.882 --> 01:04:39.947
-Yeah.
-Like. permeates

1344
01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:41.411
the air.
Doesn't matter. Anyway.

1345
01:04:41.547 --> 01:04:43.283
welcome to the Rock
of Eternity.

1346
01:04:43.951 --> 01:04:45.252
Only Champions

1347
01:04:45.387 --> 01:04:47.586
can get in here.
through any door that we want.

1348
01:04:47.721 --> 01:04:50.420
Little thing that we can do
that your sisters can't.

1349
01:04:50.556 --> 01:04:53.392
Guys. that's what I call
a total success.

1350
01:04:54.561 --> 01:04:56.428
Okay. maybe. like.
a partial total win.

1351
01:04:56.563 --> 01:04:58.360
-Told you I suck at dodgeball.
-[Shazam] Yeah.

1352
01:04:58.495 --> 01:04:59.968
you do. yeah. but you know.

1353
01:05:00.104 --> 01:05:01.263
look. Pedro. we all have
our weak spots.

1354
01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:02.770
You know what I mean?

1355
01:05:02.905 --> 01:05:04.333
And hers... [chuckles]

1356
01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:06.036
lack of strategic thinking.

1357
01:05:06.172 --> 01:05:08.011
Now for the real trade.

1358
01:05:08.146 --> 01:05:11.344
Freddy and the staff.
for your freedom.

1359
01:05:11.479 --> 01:05:12.911
[superhero Darla] And get rid
of the dome.

1360
01:05:13.046 --> 01:05:14.044
[Shazam] Oh. yeah.

1361
01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.215
And get rid of the dome.

1362
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:17.917
'Cause the city
of brotherly love

1363
01:05:18.053 --> 01:05:19.418
is gettin' a little moist.

1364
01:05:21.758 --> 01:05:23.026
Word choice. man.

1365
01:05:23.161 --> 01:05:24.122
[Shazam] Yeah. I regretted it
as soon as

1366
01:05:24.258 --> 01:05:25.723
it was coming out of my mouth.

1367
01:05:25.858 --> 01:05:26.959
[Super Hero Eugene] It's just
one of those words...

1368
01:05:27.095 --> 01:05:27.657
[Shazam] I know. I just...

1369
01:05:32.233 --> 01:05:34.835
"Dear daughters
of Asshat-Las."

1370
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:36.639
-Burn!
-[chuckles]

1371
01:05:36.775 --> 01:05:38.007
I just came up with that.

1372
01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:39.104
Make sure you put a dash
in there. though.

1373
01:05:39.239 --> 01:05:40.871
so it's really clear. Okay.

1374
01:05:41.007 --> 01:05:43.413
[clears throat]
Man. it's so good having
Steve cover grammar

1375
01:05:43.548 --> 01:05:46.148
and spelling and stuff.
it makes me sound
so much smarter.

1376
01:05:46.916 --> 01:05:48.718
[clears throat] So...

1377
01:05:48.854 --> 01:05:50.750
"A brother for a sister. huh?

1378
01:05:50.885 --> 01:05:52.318
How's that feel?

1379
01:05:52.453 --> 01:05:55.224
Also. how are you
actually sisters.

1380
01:05:55.359 --> 01:05:58.061
because the age difference
is very noticeable.

1381
01:05:58.196 --> 01:06:01.294
and slightly upsetting.
I'm not gonna lie."

1382
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:03.627
Even though I don't like you
very much.

1383
01:06:03.762 --> 01:06:05.594
I believe everyone
deserves human rights.

1384
01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:07.429
but you don't deserve
strawberry.

1385
01:06:07.564 --> 01:06:10.667
You only get yellow. [gasps]

1386
01:06:12.973 --> 01:06:14.176
She's gone!

1387
01:06:15.745 --> 01:06:16.711
Wait. what?

1388
01:06:16.847 --> 01:06:19.049
[dramatic music playing]

1389
01:06:27.522 --> 01:06:29.285
I thought we brought her in
too easily.

1390
01:06:29.421 --> 01:06:31.356
She wanted to get caught.

1391
01:06:31.492 --> 01:06:34.926
I don't get it.
Where would she even go?

1392
01:06:35.061 --> 01:06:36.264
[clanking]

01:06:44.173 --> 01:06:46.703
Well. this seemed inevitable.

1395
01:06:53.151 --> 01:06:55.677
Yep. We are so lost.
Thanks. bozo.

1396
01:06:55.813 --> 01:06:59.016
We are not lost.
Who's the wizard here?

1397
01:06:59.152 --> 01:07:00.553
I don't know.

1398
01:07:00.688 --> 01:07:02.818
You don't have any spells.
no magical artifacts.

1399
01:07:02.953 --> 01:07:05.359
you know nothing about magic.
you're just...

1400
01:07:08.832 --> 01:07:09.832
You're the wizard.

1401
01:07:09.968 --> 01:07:11.831
-Thank you.
-Whatever.

1402
01:07:11.966 --> 01:07:15.138
Now let's see if that
girlfriend of yours
can be trusted.

1403
01:07:18.876 --> 01:07:21.078
[tense music playing]

1404
01:07:28.052 --> 01:07:29.251
-[door unlocks]
-[Freddy gasps]

1405
01:07:30.153 --> 01:07:32.551
Get back. get back. Get back.

1406
01:07:42.462 --> 01:07:44.662
[whispering in other language]

1407
01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.503
[Hespera gasps]

1408
01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:02.112
[in English] Okay.
I think the coast is clear.
Let's go home.

1409
01:08:02.247 --> 01:08:03.448
One moment.

1410
01:08:03.584 --> 01:08:05.781
Did you not see
what she was holding?

1411
01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:07.789
It was an apple.
She wanted a snack.

1412
01:08:07.925 --> 01:08:09.192
What's the big deal?

1413
01:08:09.327 --> 01:08:12.355
The golden apple.
From the Tree of Life.

1414
01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:14.057
From the Tree of Life.

1415
01:08:14.192 --> 01:08:16.298
Oh. wait. hold up. didn't you
say that was somewhere safe?

1416
01:08:18.497 --> 01:08:20.966
-Billy!
-Billy. Gosh.

1417
01:08:21.101 --> 01:08:22.304
[wizard groans]

1418
01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:24.801
Where are you going now?

1419
01:08:29.539 --> 01:08:30.741
[inhales sharply]

1420
01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.409
[exhales] Nope.

1421
01:08:34.545 --> 01:08:35.746
She's not in there.

1422
01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:37.746
Nope.

1423
01:08:37.882 --> 01:08:39.487
No. no. no.
That's a hard pass.

1424
01:08:39.622 --> 01:08:41.519
-That's a hard pass.
-[Super Hero Eugene] Yo. Billy.

1425
01:08:41.655 --> 01:08:43.051
you don't gotta worry
about that one.

1426
01:08:43.186 --> 01:08:44.720
It's just a labyrinth
that doesn't go anywhere.

1427
01:08:44.856 --> 01:08:46.524
-[sniffs]
-Like an ancient Greek

1428
01:08:46.659 --> 01:08:47.890
-labyrinth?
-[Shazam] Guys...

1429
01:08:48.933 --> 01:08:50.826
[sniffs] porta-potty.

1430
01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:52.928
-[sniffs]
-[Super Hero Eugene] Mmm.

1431
01:09:02.141 --> 01:09:03.411
Hespera.

1432
01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:10.913
It's over. sisters.

1433
01:09:11.049 --> 01:09:13.883
Now we can plant the seed
and restore our realm.

1434
01:09:15.357 --> 01:09:18.391
Or we plant it in their realm.

1435
01:09:18.527 --> 01:09:21.931
But that would destroy
their world.

1436
01:09:22.066 --> 01:09:24.231
Just as they destroyed ours.

1437
01:09:24.366 --> 01:09:26.397
[Hespera] You can't be serious.

1438
01:09:26.532 --> 01:09:28.302
-Yes.
-[Anthea] No.

1439
01:09:28.438 --> 01:09:29.733
No. that's not
what we agreed to.

1440
01:09:29.869 --> 01:09:31.536
[Kalypso] Anthea.
you simpering bore.

1441
01:09:31.672 --> 01:09:33.237
[Hespera] She's right.
we've spent ages

1442
01:09:33.373 --> 01:09:34.877
waiting for this moment.

1443
01:09:35.013 --> 01:09:36.211
[Anthea] We have the seed.

1444
01:09:36.346 --> 01:09:38.181
We have the staff
and its powers.

1445
01:09:38.316 --> 01:09:39.544
[Hespera]
We are not squandering it

1446
01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.448
for your personal
satisfaction.

1447
01:09:41.584 --> 01:09:44.483
[whispering]
No. I should go. not you.

1448
01:09:44.619 --> 01:09:46.314
Look. I know
what you're thinking.

1449
01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:48.757
The kid with the crutch
doesn't exactly
sing "sneak thief."

1450
01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:51.290
But here's the deal.
Your knees crack like crazy
when you walk.

1451
01:09:51.426 --> 01:09:52.759
-It's pathetic.
-[knees crack]

1452
01:09:52.895 --> 01:09:53.956
See?

1453
01:09:55.033 --> 01:09:56.265
Fortune be with you. Freddy.

1454
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.697
Thank you.
What did you just call me?

1455
01:09:59.432 --> 01:10:01.863
Freddy. Freddy Freeman.

1456
01:10:01.999 --> 01:10:05.438
[chuckles] That's it.
You nailed it.

1457
01:10:05.573 --> 01:10:07.442
I'll see you
on the other side.

1458
01:10:08.677 --> 01:10:10.079
[Hespera] Even if we did.
the Tree of Life

1459
01:10:10.214 --> 01:10:11.712
would not thrive
in their soil.

1460
01:10:11.848 --> 01:10:15.015
It would despoil. it would
disfigure into something...

1461
01:10:15.151 --> 01:10:16.346
[Kalypso] Monstrous?

1462
01:10:16.482 --> 01:10:18.722
That is what humans are.

1463
01:10:18.857 --> 01:10:21.718
It is only fitting
that we bring
our monsters to their world

1464
01:10:21.854 --> 01:10:24.657
and do to them
as they did to us.

1465
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:29.391
[Anthea] We agreed
to restore balance

1466
01:10:29.526 --> 01:10:33.029
and vengeance has
great measure of weight
on those scales.

1467
01:10:33.164 --> 01:10:36.302
Anthea. humans are villains.
even to themselves.

1468
01:10:36.437 --> 01:10:38.236
-No. not all.
-All.

1469
01:10:38.372 --> 01:10:41.909
[Hespera] Sister.
I fear your rage
has gotten the better of you.

1470
01:10:42.045 --> 01:10:43.146
[Kalypso] Why?

1471
01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:45.446
Humans wreak havoc
and devastation.

1472
01:10:45.582 --> 01:10:47.613
then pray to the gods
to absolve them.

1473
01:10:47.749 --> 01:10:49.913
They actually pray
for order and peace

1474
01:10:50.048 --> 01:10:53.288
when all they do
is dismantle it at every turn.

1475
01:10:53.424 --> 01:10:55.519
Anthea. I want you
to take the apple

1476
01:10:55.654 --> 01:10:57.954
and plant it in our garden.

1477
01:10:59.089 --> 01:11:00.526
[Kalypso] Of course
you turn to her.

1478
01:11:00.662 --> 01:11:02.330
Father would be ashamed
of both of you.

1479
01:11:02.465 --> 01:11:04.165
-[object clatters]
-[Freddy yelps]

1480
01:11:04.301 --> 01:11:06.369
Where did that even come from?

1481
01:11:07.667 --> 01:11:09.500
-Hi!
-You favor her. Hespera.

1482
01:11:09.635 --> 01:11:11.539
and see how she betrays us.

1483
01:11:14.908 --> 01:11:16.409
Deliver him
to his proper fate. sister.

1484
01:11:16.544 --> 01:11:18.876
-No!
-[Kalypso] Kill him!

1485
01:11:22.316 --> 01:11:23.746
What is that?

1486
01:11:23.881 --> 01:11:25.949
[Shazam] Great question.
No idea.

1487
01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:28.385
But made you look.

1488
01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.887
Billy! [chuckles]

1489
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:33.228
-Oh!
-Oh.

1490
01:11:33.363 --> 01:11:34.857
-[Freddy gasps]
-Your crutch!

1491
01:11:34.993 --> 01:11:38.065
-Oh! Shazam!
-[lightning cracks]

1492
01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.402
-Yes!
-No!

1493
01:11:43.275 --> 01:11:45.375
So. we have a lot
to talk about.

1494
01:11:55.285 --> 01:11:57.684
Kalypso. hand me the staff.

1495
01:11:59.388 --> 01:12:00.989
You are not fit to wield it.

1496
01:12:01.124 --> 01:12:02.358
More fit than you.

1497
01:12:02.494 --> 01:12:03.888
You had him in your hands.
yet did nothing.

1498
01:12:04.023 --> 01:12:07.428
Our sole purpose is
to avenge our father.

1499
01:12:07.564 --> 01:12:09.828
but everyone here
has become weak.

1500
01:12:10.695 --> 01:12:13.062
Ladon. world-eater.

1501
01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:16.267
rise from the pit!

1502
01:12:16.402 --> 01:12:18.606
[clanking]

1503
01:12:20.671 --> 01:12:22.841
[Ladon roars]

1504
01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:26.816
[Shazam] Go. go. go!

1505
01:12:26.951 --> 01:12:28.151
[superhero Darla]
Captain Everypower!
Where's he going?

1506
01:12:28.286 --> 01:12:29.484
[Super Hero Eugene] What the...

1507
01:12:29.619 --> 01:12:31.520
-[superhero Mary screams]
-[Ladon roars]

1508
01:12:33.353 --> 01:12:35.392
[all screaming]

1509
01:12:37.829 --> 01:12:38.927
[roars]

1510
01:12:39.062 --> 01:12:41.626
[snoring]

1511
01:12:41.762 --> 01:12:43.961
[superheroes chattering
faintly]

1512
01:12:45.201 --> 01:12:46.403
[Rosa] Victor?

1513
01:12:47.037 --> 01:12:48.236
Victor. wake up.

1514
01:12:48.371 --> 01:12:51.468
Hello. Oh. God. woman. What?

1515
01:12:51.603 --> 01:12:53.004
Dad. We gotta go!

1516
01:12:53.139 --> 01:12:55.105
-We gotta get out of here.
-We have to go right now!

1517
01:12:55.241 --> 01:12:57.338
This is funny. right?
I know what this looks like.

1518
01:12:57.474 --> 01:12:59.345
That's not true. I have
no idea what this looks like.

1519
01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.150
Just don't freak out.

1520
01:13:01.285 --> 01:13:02.546
[Victor and Rosa screaming]

1521
01:13:02.681 --> 01:13:04.883
[all speaking at once]

1522
01:13:06.151 --> 01:13:07.720
I said don't freak out!
Look at me. it's Billy.

1523
01:13:07.856 --> 01:13:09.490
Rosa. it's Billy. okay?
And that's Eugene.

1524
01:13:09.626 --> 01:13:10.788
-and that's Freddy...
-It's me.

1525
01:13:10.924 --> 01:13:12.020
That's Darla
and that's Mary. obvi.

1526
01:13:12.155 --> 01:13:13.863
and then Pedro.
just normal Pedro.

1527
01:13:13.998 --> 01:13:15.663
[Shazam panting]

1528
01:13:15.798 --> 01:13:16.825
Guys. this is no time
for secrets. okay?

1529
01:13:16.961 --> 01:13:19.061
We have to tell 'em the truth.

1530
01:13:19.196 --> 01:13:21.630
-[all] We're superheroes.
-I'm gay.

1531
01:13:21.766 --> 01:13:23.000
Yeah. we know. bud.

1532
01:13:24.176 --> 01:13:25.673
-You knew?
-Yeah.

1533
01:13:26.539 --> 01:13:28.608
-Yeah.
-Oh.

1534
01:13:28.744 --> 01:13:30.513
-I'm the wizard.
-Oh. this is the wizard.

1535
01:13:30.648 --> 01:13:32.010
He's a wizard who's called
"the wizard."

1536
01:13:32.145 --> 01:13:33.813
Okay. get dressed right now.
Come on. hurry up.

1537
01:13:33.948 --> 01:13:35.083
[superhero Darla]
Put on these clothes.

1538
01:13:35.218 --> 01:13:36.546
This is so weird.

1539
01:13:36.681 --> 01:13:37.815
[Shazam] Yep. yep.

1540
01:13:37.951 --> 01:13:40.318
You guys are
the Philly Fiascoes?

1541
01:13:40.454 --> 01:13:43.826
Okay. This is in no way
an acknowledgement
of that stupid nickname

1542
01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:45.889
but. yes. that would be us.
Now can you pick up the pace?

1543
01:13:46.024 --> 01:13:48.223
We have to go.
The dragon is here!

1544
01:13:49.032 --> 01:13:50.464
Dragon?

1545
01:13:50.599 --> 01:13:52.799

-[Super Hero Eugene] You okay?
-[breathing heavily]

1550
01:14:29.072 --> 01:14:30.067
Okay.

1551
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:32.672
I know this is a lot
to take in.

1552
01:14:32.808 --> 01:14:34.671
but I promise
to explain it all later.

1553
01:14:34.806 --> 01:14:36.339
[Victor] Explain what?

1554
01:14:36.475 --> 01:14:38.209
That our kids are superheroes
being hunted by Greek gods

1555
01:14:38.345 --> 01:14:39.844
that used a dragon to destroy
the house we just bought?

1556
01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:42.247
-Yeah.
-Wait. you bought the house?

1557
01:14:42.382 --> 01:14:43.618
Yeah.

Run! Go!

"Lived a long life?"

We're the same age.
You're young. We're young.

We have to figure
something out.

Hey. take my powers back.

1650
01:22:16.472 --> 01:22:17.598
You gave 'em to me. so you can
take 'em back. right?

1651
01:22:17.734 --> 01:22:19.941
I am no longer the champion.
You are!

1652
01:22:20.077 --> 01:22:21.104
You think I know
how to fix this. dude.

1653
01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.706
but I really don't. okay?

1654
01:22:22.841 --> 01:22:25.180
I. I didn't even know
who those Greek sisters were.

1655
01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:26.882
I had to Google them.
But you know who they are.

1656
01:22:27.018 --> 01:22:28.616
which means you know
what to do.

1657
01:22:28.752 --> 01:22:30.446
And you were right.

1658
01:22:30.581 --> 01:22:32.650
You picked
the wrong champion. man.

1659
01:22:32.786 --> 01:22:34.550
I mean. that's why I always
say "all or none." right?

1660
01:22:34.686 --> 01:22:37.224
Because without my family.
I'm nothing.

1661
01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:42.497
And honestly. I have no idea
what I'm doin'.

[wizard] No.

1663
01:22:43.627 --> 01:22:45.094
You don't have
a shred of wisdom

in that brain of yours.

1665
01:22:48.035 --> 01:22:50.368
But your heart is wise.

1666
01:22:50.504 --> 01:22:53.769
And it knows exactly
what must be done.

1667
01:22:53.905 --> 01:22:57.772
I spent millennia searching
for a worthy champion

1668
01:22:59.382 --> 01:23:01.211
and no one was worthy
of what I once shared

1669
01:23:01.347 --> 01:23:03.644
with my brothers and sisters.

1670
01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.780
But when you shared
your powers.

1671
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.352
you did not hesitate.

1672
01:23:08.488 --> 01:23:10.856
For you. everyone
can be worthy

1673
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:12.321
if given a chance.

1674
01:23:12.457 --> 01:23:15.861
Now. go fight for your family.

1675
01:23:15.997 --> 01:23:18.065
Go fight for the world.

Now. I'm gonna go
get that staff

these things away

if I don't get eaten
by a dragon.

to keep me.

01:51:50.179 --> 01:51:51.174
What?

[Mary and Pedro gasp]

2107
01:52:28.042 --> 01:52:29.542
[chuckles] Whoa.

2108
01:52:48.668 --> 01:52:49.600
[Freddy] Whoa.

2109
01:52:49.736 --> 01:52:51.938
[powers resonating]

It's a zombie!

2114
01:53:21.163 --> 01:53:23.233
[Shazam grunts] Guys!

2115
01:53:23.934 --> 01:53:25.338
What the hell?

2116
01:53:25.474 --> 01:53:27.101
You buried me?

2117
01:53:27.236 --> 01:53:29.672
In what. like. two minutes?

2118
01:53:29.807 --> 01:53:30.739
Oh. Billy!

2119
01:53:30.875 --> 01:53:32.475
[all whooping]

2120
01:53:32.611 --> 01:53:33.646
Hey.

2121
01:53:33.781 --> 01:53:36.213
Oh. man. I missed you guys.

2122
01:53:38.947 --> 01:53:40.613
Hi. Hey.

2123
01:53:41.522 --> 01:53:43.215
Oh. my God. Hi.

2124
01:53:43.351 --> 01:53:44.989
Why didn't anybody tell...

2125
01:53:45.124 --> 01:53:46.960
Hi. Sorry. sorry.
I didn't. uh...

2126
01:53:47.095 --> 01:53:49.990
I didn't see you there.
I was. um. I was...

2127
01:53:50.126 --> 01:53:51.426
I was dead at the time.

2128
01:53:52.468 --> 01:53:53.560
So. you. uh...

2129
01:53:54.537 --> 01:53:56.002
you got my bird letter?

2130
01:53:56.999 --> 01:53:58.466
Oh. I. uh...

2131
01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:01.502
I think you've got
something...

2132
01:54:03.312 --> 01:54:04.443
On my...

2133
01:54:04.578 --> 01:54:06.144
Where... Oh.

2134
01:54:06.711 --> 01:54:07.948
What?

2135
01:54:08.648 --> 01:54:09.616
That's a spider.

2136
01:54:09.752 --> 01:54:11.117
I'm sorry. that's disgusting.

2137
01:54:11.252 --> 01:54:13.650
Also. [chuckling]
that's really embarrassing.

2138
01:54:13.785 --> 01:54:14.987
Yes. it is.

2139
01:54:15.122 --> 01:54:17.457
But it was an amazing thing
you did.

2140
01:54:17.593 --> 01:54:19.222
The sacrifice you made.

2141
01:54:19.357 --> 01:54:22.223
You brought this world
back to life.

2142
01:54:22.359 --> 01:54:24.598
Maybe this time.
gods and humans

2143
01:54:24.733 --> 01:54:26.365
can learn to live in peace.

2144
01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:27.495
Yeah.

2145
01:54:28.837 --> 01:54:30.971
Use the power of Zeus wisely.

2146
01:54:33.037 --> 01:54:34.568
Be well. Billy Batson.

2147
01:54:36.607 --> 01:54:39.480
Hey. you know. just because
your father's power

2148
01:54:39.615 --> 01:54:40.773
is surging through me.

2149
01:54:40.908 --> 01:54:43.076
that doesn't technically
make us related. you know.

2150
01:54:43.212 --> 01:54:44.512
and I'm gonna be 18

2151
01:54:44.647 --> 01:54:46.346
in. like. five months. so...
[clicks tongue]

2152
01:54:46.481 --> 01:54:48.582
Stick to saving
the world. kid.

2153
01:54:48.718 --> 01:54:50.784
Yeah. you know. like.
that's... Okay. cool.

2154
01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:52.287
See ya.

2155
01:54:52.423 --> 01:54:54.120
What's with our boys
and older women?

2156
01:54:54.255 --> 01:54:55.457
[exhales sharply]

2157
01:54:57.333 --> 01:54:58.863
Hey.

2158
01:54:58.998 --> 01:55:00.500
Who wants their powers back?

2159
01:55:00.635 --> 01:55:01.628
[Shazam chuckles]

2160
01:55:02.396 --> 01:55:04.265
We can do that. right?

2161
01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:05.571
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay. good.

2162
01:55:05.706 --> 01:55:06.807
Good. good. good.

2163
01:55:06.942 --> 01:55:08.606
[Victor] I'd like
our house back.

2164
01:55:08.741 --> 01:55:09.774
Can we do that?

2165
01:55:09.909 --> 01:55:11.712
[upbeat music playing]

2166
01:55:11.847 --> 01:55:13.410
-[Victor] Dinner!
-Coming.

2167
01:55:13.545 --> 01:55:16.115
Aw. Thank you for respecting
the cross-stitch.

2168
01:55:18.553 --> 01:55:19.547
[Rosa chuckles]

2169
01:55:20.622 --> 01:55:21.888
[Rosa] Anthea.

2170
01:55:22.024 --> 01:55:23.118
Have you decided what
you're gonna do

2171
01:55:23.254 --> 01:55:25.688
about that god realm of yours?

2172
01:55:25.824 --> 01:55:28.455
Well. actually I'm gonna take
some time off while it heals.

2173
01:55:28.591 --> 01:55:30.664
Spend some time
with the common folk.

2174
01:55:30.799 --> 01:55:32.198
Learn some about your world.

2175
01:55:32.333 --> 01:55:34.766
about how. maybe.
we can learn from each other.

2176
01:55:34.902 --> 01:55:36.331
Number one sign of wisdom:

2177
01:55:36.467 --> 01:55:38.230
Admitting there's always
more to learn.

2178
01:55:38.366 --> 01:55:39.703
I'm coming around to it.

2179
01:55:39.838 --> 01:55:41.206
[doorbell rings]

2180
01:55:41.807 --> 01:55:43.142
I got it.

2181
01:55:47.449 --> 01:55:48.444
Whoa.

2182
01:55:49.078 --> 01:55:50.545
Uh. guys?

2183
01:55:51.145 --> 01:55:52.081
Guys!

2184
01:55:52.216 --> 01:55:54.450
[suspenseful music playing]

2185
01:55:59.726 --> 01:56:00.995
It's the wizard.

2186
01:56:02.392 --> 01:56:04.226
-Oh. my God!
-[Rosa] No way!

2187
01:56:04.361 --> 01:56:05.996
-Yes.
-Look at this guy!

2188
01:56:06.132 --> 01:56:07.327
Look at him. he's so handsome.

2189
01:56:07.463 --> 01:56:08.694
You pimpin' now. what is this?

2190
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:10.431
-[Billy] You look amazing.
-You look great!

2191
01:56:10.567 --> 01:56:12.565
Well. I was
in the neighborhood

2192
01:56:12.701 --> 01:56:14.306
and. um. I just wanted
to express

2193
01:56:14.441 --> 01:56:16.639
-my gratitude before I go.
-[doorbell rings. pops]

2194
01:56:16.775 --> 01:56:21.079
Sorry. Doorbell's broken.
Actually. everything's broken.

2195
01:56:21.214 --> 01:56:23.017
-[Freddy chuckles]
-Not everything.

2196
01:56:25.681 --> 01:56:27.317
You were just
in the neighborhood?

2197
01:56:27.453 --> 01:56:29.649
[chuckles] Okay.
I came for the staff.

2198
01:56:29.784 --> 01:56:31.685
Perhaps I will hold
onto it for now.

2199
01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:35.863
I also wanted to see
your faces one last time

2200
01:56:35.998 --> 01:56:37.697
before I turn into a pile
of ash.

2201
01:56:37.833 --> 01:56:39.132
-Wait. what?
-No!

2202
01:56:39.267 --> 01:56:41.197
I am making a joke.
I have an Uber waiting.

2203
01:56:41.332 --> 01:56:42.930
-And besides...
-[chuckles]

2204
01:56:43.066 --> 01:56:45.937
...I've been trapped in rocks
and prisons for far too long.

2205
01:56:46.072 --> 01:56:47.937
It's time to see your world.

2206
01:56:48.073 --> 01:56:49.470
It's been an honor.

2207
01:56:49.606 --> 01:56:52.211
a privilege.
watching you all soar.

2208
01:56:52.346 --> 01:56:53.711
You know. you're not such
a bad wizard.

2209
01:56:53.846 --> 01:56:55.080
Thank you. Jeff.

2210
01:56:55.216 --> 01:56:57.249
-[sighs] It never ends.
-[chuckles]

2211
01:56:58.379 --> 01:56:59.581
[Billy] Also.

2212
01:57:00.955 --> 01:57:02.584
what's my superhero name?

2213
01:57:05.022 --> 01:57:07.490
Your name is...

2214
01:57:08.530 --> 01:57:10.125
Shazam.

2215
01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:11.190
-Of course.
-Yeah.

2216
01:57:11.326 --> 01:57:13.562
[all agreeing]

2217
01:57:15.102 --> 01:57:17.231
I still think we can beat it.

2218
01:57:17.366 --> 01:57:19.568
[upbeat music playing]

2219
01:59:56.595 --> 01:59:58.161
My feet hurt.
How much further?

2220
01:59:58.296 --> 01:59:59.429
About ten seconds less

2221
01:59:59.565 --> 02:00:00.860
than the last time
you asked me.

2222
02:00:00.995 --> 02:00:02.531
I'm sorry. I just feel
like we could

2223
02:00:02.667 --> 02:00:04.003
have parked
a little bit closer.

2224
02:00:04.139 --> 02:00:05.270
He doesn't know we're coming.

2225
02:00:05.406 --> 02:00:06.702
and I didn't want
to spook him.

2226
02:00:06.837 --> 02:00:09.072
"Spook him."
He's a superhero. not a deer.

2227
02:00:09.208 --> 02:00:10.475
All right. let's go.

2228
02:00:10.610 --> 02:00:12.512
And then you can tell Waller
that even though

2229
02:00:12.648 --> 02:00:14.914
she thinks this guy could be
a good addition to the team.

2230
02:00:15.050 --> 02:00:16.348
we never actually met him

2231
02:00:16.484 --> 02:00:18.714
because you wore
shitty walking shoes.

2232
02:00:18.850 --> 02:00:20.648
[chuckles] Okay. first of all.
they're boots.

2233
02:00:20.784 --> 02:00:22.723
and they're not shitty.
they're new.

2234
02:00:22.858 --> 02:00:25.623
-I just haven't had a chance
to break them in yet.
-Shut up.

2235
02:00:25.758 --> 02:00:28.895
Waller said this guy
is as powerful as they come.

2236
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:30.697
but a little immature.

2237
02:00:30.832 --> 02:00:31.958
Oh. great.

2238
02:00:32.867 --> 02:00:35.500
Whoo! [chuckles]

2239
02:00:40.138 --> 02:00:42.342
[grunting]

2240
02:00:44.244 --> 02:00:45.811
-Billy Batson.
-Yeah?

2241
02:00:45.946 --> 02:00:47.412
I mean. no.

2242
02:00:47.548 --> 02:00:48.941
I've never heard that name
in my life.

2243
02:00:49.077 --> 02:00:50.480
I don't know who
you're talking about.

2244
02:00:50.616 --> 02:00:51.945
But I'd like to meet
that person

2245
02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:53.815
'cause they sound super cool.
And funny.

2246
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:56.715
And talented.
And ridiculously handsome.

2247
02:00:56.851 --> 02:00:58.357
but. like. in a dangerous way.

2248
02:00:58.492 --> 02:01:00.290
What the hell
are you talking about?

2249
02:01:00.425 --> 02:01:02.425
Relax. We know who you are.

2250
02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:04.892
-How?
-Don't worry about that.

2251
02:01:05.934 --> 02:01:06.692
Who are you guys?

2252
02:01:06.828 --> 02:01:08.167
Don't worry about that either.

2253
02:01:08.302 --> 02:01:09.829
Look. we've seen
what you can do.

2254
02:01:09.965 --> 02:01:11.597
And we're here
to make you an offer.

2255
02:01:11.733 --> 02:01:12.697
How would you like to join

2256
02:01:12.833 --> 02:01:14.072
-the Justice...
-Yes!

2257
02:01:14.207 --> 02:01:15.507
A thousand times yes!

2258
02:01:15.642 --> 02:01:17.408
Oh. my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!

2259
02:01:17.544 --> 02:01:19.410
Well. I mean.
not this exactly.

2260
02:01:19.545 --> 02:01:20.473
Like. normally.
it's Wonder Woman

2261
02:01:20.609 --> 02:01:21.881
in the dream. but...

2262
02:01:22.016 --> 02:01:23.278
-Ew.
-Huh?

2263
02:01:23.414 --> 02:01:25.448
Well. that was easy.

2264
02:01:25.583 --> 02:01:27.118
Welcome
to the Justice Society.

2265
02:01:27.254 --> 02:01:29.152
Yeah! Aweso... Wait. what?

2266
02:01:29.288 --> 02:01:30.521
The Justice Society?

2267
02:01:30.657 --> 02:01:31.957
Is that different
than the Justice League?

2268
02:01:32.093 --> 02:01:33.523
Yes. The Justice Society

2269
02:01:33.659 --> 02:01:35.093
is different
than the Justice League

2270
02:01:35.229 --> 02:01:36.759
because of how words work.

2271
02:01:36.895 --> 02:01:38.726
I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group.

2272
02:01:38.862 --> 02:01:40.961
-So. that's you guys. right?
-No.

2273
02:01:41.097 --> 02:01:43.166
Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman. dude?

2274
02:01:43.302 --> 02:01:45.103
He's joking. right?

2275
02:01:45.239 --> 02:01:48.375
-No?
-Okay. I'm out.

2276
02:01:48.510 --> 02:01:50.406
I'm gonna wait here.
'cause of the shoes.

2277
02:01:50.541 --> 02:01:52.237
Can you drive by and get me?

2278
02:01:52.372 --> 02:01:54.841
[Shazam] Hey. just a little
constructive criticism.

2279
02:01:54.977 --> 02:01:56.315
It's pretty confusing
that there are

2280
02:01:56.450 --> 02:01:58.348
two separate groups
of superheroes

2281
02:01:58.484 --> 02:01:59.815
that are totally unaffiliated.

2282
02:01:59.951 --> 02:02:01.921
but both have "Justice"
in their name. you know.

2283
02:02:02.056 --> 02:02:03.951
Like. have you guys ever
thought about doing
a rebranding of sorts?

2284
02:02:04.087 --> 02:02:07.060
'Cause just a quick search
on Thesaurus.com.

2285
02:02:07.196 --> 02:02:08.754
you got so many options. man.

2286
02:02:08.890 --> 02:02:11.825
Like. "Authority Society." Eh?

2287
02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.627
Uh. uh. "Code Society."
That's stupid.

2288
02:02:13.763 --> 02:02:15.200
These are. like. legal terms.

2289
02:02:15.336 --> 02:02:18.333
[gasps] "The Avenger Society."

2290
02:02:18.468 --> 02:02:19.732
[inhales sharply]

2291
02:02:19.868 --> 02:02:21.639
I like that. for some reason.

2292
02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:26.512
[gentle music playing]

2293
02:02:41.557 --> 02:02:43.925
[music builds up]

2294
02:02:50.534 --> 02:02:52.736
[dramatic music playing]

2295
02:06:06.599 --> 02:06:08.800
[mysterious music playing]

2296
02:07:34.818 --> 02:07:37.020
[intense music playing]

2297
02:08:35.010 --> 02:08:36.943
[distant chattering]

2298
02:08:37.079 --> 02:08:39.280
[unsettling music playing]

2299
02:08:54.731 --> 02:08:56.594
[voice laughing]

2300
02:08:56.730 --> 02:09:00.870
[Mister Mind] Well. well.
Doctor. We meet again.

2301
02:09:01.006 --> 02:09:02.568
Where in the hell
have you been?

2302
02:09:02.703 --> 02:09:05.839
[Mister Mind] To implement
the perfect plan. Doctor.

2303
02:09:05.975 --> 02:09:08.140
one must have patience.

2304
02:09:08.275 --> 02:09:10.047
What are you talking about?

2305
02:09:11.619 --> 02:09:13.215
It's been two goddamn years!

2306
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:18.391
Yes. But what is time
but a trick of the mind?

2307
02:09:18.526 --> 02:09:19.722
A meaningless measure.

2308
02:09:19.857 --> 02:09:22.258
Hey. I'm 57 years old.

2309
02:09:22.393 --> 02:09:25.491
I'm stuck in a concrete box
surrounded by lunatics

2310
02:09:25.626 --> 02:09:27.495
waiting for a worm to enact
some. what.

2311
02:09:27.630 --> 02:09:30.134
vague plan I've been told
absolutely nothing about?

2312
02:09:30.269 --> 02:09:32.905
It takes me a very long time
to get places. okay?

2313
02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:35.774
I do not have legs.
I do not have wings.

2314
02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:39.345
I just slither around
endlessly.

2315
02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:41.742
But not for long.

2316
02:09:41.877 --> 02:09:43.476
[laughing]

2317
02:09:44.717 --> 02:09:46.446
Tell me everything.

2318
02:09:47.889 --> 02:09:49.849
Just one more thing
I need to do.

2319
02:09:49.984 --> 02:09:52.188
What? No!

2320
02:09:53.625 --> 02:09:55.290
Oh. goddamn it!
