and nobody judged him. right?

‐ Everybody judged him.
they crucified him.

21
00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.542
‐ Your online grade book says
you received a 96.

22
00:01:58.542 --> 00:02:01.083
‐ What happened?
‐ It was just one question
about Judge Danforth.

23
00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:02.333
It was a dumb mistake.

24
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:05.042

One little mistake can ruin
the rest of your life.

a depressed skunk.

my butt caused.

underwear this time.

LUPE: Sunny. when you start dating.
you'll see.

51
00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:47.833
you gotta keep 'em hooked.
gotta use what God gave you.

00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:50.667
SUNNY: [scoffs] What exactly
do you think God gave me.

53
00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:52.750
except a nightguard
and an overbearing mother?

54
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.708

embarrassed about this stuff.

We finally tried reverse cowgirl.

57
00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:02.750
‐ And? How was it?

58
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.083
Amazing. right?

59
00:04:04.083 --> 00:04:07.042
‐ Yeah. I mean. it wasn't...
that great for me.

60
00:04:07.042 --> 00:04:09.083
but I feel like it looked cool.

61
00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:11.500
My butthole's not my best feature...

62
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.500
‐ Girls are horse fucking and
I haven't even had my first kiss.

63
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.958
I'm so behind.

64

what they mean. okay?

65
00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:22.042
‐ Eww. gross. is that
like a Mexican thing?

66
00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:24.125
‐ Yeah. I mean.
if your armpit hair's that long.

67
00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:26.083
I can't imagine what else is overgrown.

68
00:04:26.083 --> 00:04:28.083

00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:31.792
Glad you spent your free time thinking
about what my pussy looks like. Megan.

70
00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:34.875
‐ Oh my God. I don't.

71
00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:37.917
Obviously. I don't.

72
00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:41.000
‐ That was so funny.
She was really embarrassed.

73
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.542
Listen. obviously boys like
your "au naturel" look.

74
00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:47.208
Meanwhile. the underwear my mom buys me
renders me invisible.

75
00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:49.917
Take a look. It's like sexual camouflage.

76
00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:51.875
‐ Oh. that's your underwear?

77
00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:55.250
Thought you just shaved
your nipples and pubes off.

78
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.542

00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:02.625

My Hero Academia. Perfect night.

80
00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:05.750
‐ Also. I have a thousand‐piece puzz
that I wanted to get my claws into.

81
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.875
‐ Oh!
‐ And we can go through all the Halloween
candy that your dad confiscated.

82
00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:11.208
‐ If you can find it.
‐ I did and I ate it.

I just creamed my pants.

He's like an athletic librarian.

LUPE: I totally do not understand
the attraction.

89
00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:29.833
I mean. he's. like. cute. but he's got
major guidance counselor vibes.

90
00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:32.333
‐ Yeah.
LUPE: Well. maybe you should
invite him over

91
00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:34.958
for a little
"Disney+ and Thrust." huh?

92
00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.042
He can bang you doggy style
while you watch Lady and the Tramp.

93
00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:41.042
‐ How would we do the pasta thing
if he's behind me?

94
00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:43.792

‐ Also. you know I want
my first time to be romantic.

Doesn't it feel weird?

99
00:05:56.792 --> 00:05:58.875
‐ Stop.
‐ Okay. exactly.

100
00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:01.000
‐ So don't do that.
‐ Doesn't matter anyway. Look.

101
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.500
Megan Dillons has staked her claim.

102
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.500
‐ Do you need to like a little...
‐ Well. it would be...

103
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.750
‐ It's kind of dry.

104
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.417
‐ How am I supposed to compete with that?

105
00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:09.625
‐ I definitely wouldn't lick it.

106
00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:12.042
‐ I don't know. deep‐throat a basketball?

107
00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:15.167
[whistle blows]
‐ Hello. ladies. Sunny. Lupe.

108
00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:16.833
‐ Hi. Kyle.

109
00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:18.833
‐ What's that behind your ear?

110
00:06:20.917 --> 00:06:24.500
Is that a flattened penny
from the Corn Palace?

111
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.167
‐ She's never been there.
‐ Yeah. my mom doesn't let me go there.

112
00:06:27.167 --> 00:06:29.750
She's weirded out
by the phallic nature of corn.

113
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.875
‐ Oh. I didn't even think about it
like that. I love that place.

My church's youth group is throwing

let you watch Harry Potter?

118
00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:44.250
Because mine did.

119
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.500
‐ Kyle. how many times do I have to tell
you. I don't want to compare churches?

120
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.042
‐ Okay. okay. I just think it'll be fun.

121
00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.167

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:15.167

is puberty is telling you

to step on the gas.

When you finally take that first drive.

153
00:08:23.917 --> 00:08:28.042
you're gonna want it
to be with your spouse. okay?

Oh. yes. Emma?

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.208

that doesn't like count. right?

156
00:08:34.208 --> 00:08:36.625
‐ What if I want to drive my car alone.

157
00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:39.500
you know. just to make sure
that the oil still works?

158
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.708
‐ Okay. okay. does anybody
have a real question?

‐ Yes. Hunter.
HUNTER: It's a real question.

160
00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:49.958
So. how does giving a passenger "a ride"

161
00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.667
actually make a difference
in how a car drives?

162
00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:56.167
‐ Oh. well. just because the guy can tell

163
00:08:56.167 --> 00:08:57.708
if the...

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.083

687
00:35:05.083 --> 00:35:07.375
Does he have like a giant
hairy birthmark on his dick?

688

We're headed toward Rapid City.

‐ He's the only person around here
who grows dent corn

762
00:38:21.458 --> 00:38:24.042
instead of sweet corn.

763
00:38:24.042 --> 00:38:25.333

764
00:38:25.333 --> 00:38:27.167

766
00:38:29.125 --> 00:38:30.667
‐ You're gonna start countin'.

767
00:38:30.667 --> 00:38:34.125
You're gonna give yourself
a one‐Mississippi. two‐Mississippi...

768
00:38:34.125 --> 00:38:37.833
You'll go to 20‐Mississippi and then
you'll take a right at the doll museum.

769
00:38:37.833 --> 00:38:39.500
‐ Uh. are there any street names?

770
00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.667

771
00:38:41.208 --> 00:38:43.083
You know. probably.

772
00:38:43.083 --> 00:38:46.167
So then you're gonna come to a rock...

773
00:38:46.167 --> 00:38:47.750
But not just any rock...

774
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:49.875
[phone buzzing]
Fist Rock.

775
00:38:49.875 --> 00:38:52.667
And then things get a tiny bit strange.

776
00:38:52.667 --> 00:38:54.958
There's a few houses
with bullet holes in 'em.

777
00:38:54.958 --> 00:38:57.917
You'll go six more Mississippis.
and you will be on the highway.

778
00:38:57.917 --> 00:39:00.125
‐ Okay. Think I got that.

783
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.417
You are gonna love it.

784
00:39:11.417 --> 00:39:13.125
It's beautiful. I got married there.

785
00:39:13.125 --> 00:39:14.542
‐ Oh.
‐ Congratulations.

786
00:39:14.542 --> 00:39:18.292
‐ Yeah. well. "congrats"
is not quite the word.

787
00:39:18.292 --> 00:39:19.833
LUPE: Oh.
‐ Hmm‐mm.

788
00:39:19.833 --> 00:39:21.042
BOTH: Sorry.

789
00:39:21.042 --> 00:39:23.042
‐ Something happened.

790
00:39:25.375 --> 00:39:27.083
SUNNY: What happened?

791
00:39:27.083 --> 00:39:28.625
‐ You wanna guess?

792
00:39:28.625 --> 00:39:30.667
‐ Uh. it was an amicable split?

793
00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:34.042
‐ No. Way worse. You wanna guess?

794
00:39:34.042 --> 00:39:36.917
‐ I don't really want to.
‐ No.

795
00:39:36.917 --> 00:39:38.875
‐ He did that thing from Footloose.

796
00:39:38.875 --> 00:39:42.500
where he had one...
one foot in each car window

797
00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.167
and he was sort of surfing.
but. you know.

798
00:39:45.167 --> 00:39:47.583
one started going faster
and veering a little to the right

799
00:39:47.583 --> 00:39:50.625
and one started veering
a tiny bit to the left.

800
00:39:50.625 --> 00:39:53.042
and he just split right in half.

801
00:39:53.042 --> 00:39:57.250
right up the seam of his balls.
and just right up the middle of his face.

802
00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:00.125
And just. the right half of him
was on one side.

803
00:40:00.125 --> 00:40:01.750
the left half of him was on the other.

804
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:04.917
So we weren't married very long.
but we had a beautiful wedding

805
00:40:04.917 --> 00:40:07.208
amongst those shorthaired dolls.

806
00:40:10.667 --> 00:40:12.167

808
00:40:14.667 --> 00:40:18.625

Seriously. I'll pee on you. dude.

01:39:05.917 --> 01:39:08.667
Plus. I will never hear
the end of it from your mom.

2031
01:39:18.083 --> 01:39:19.833
‐ I love you. Dad.

2032
01:39:20.792 --> 01:39:22.333
‐ I love you. too. mija.

2033
01:39:32.417 --> 01:39:33.750
Nice pin.

2034
01:39:42.208 --> 01:39:44.375
‐ Shut up. [laughs. sniffles]

2035
01:39:55.125 --> 01:39:57.875
‐ Mommy. I need to...

2036
01:39:57.875 --> 01:39:59.917
‐ You took my car

2037
01:39:59.917 --> 01:40:03.625
without my permission
to some bowling alley in Agatha?

2038
01:40:03.625 --> 01:40:05.750
‐ [whispering] Damn you. Indian Mafia.

2039
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:08.667
‐ You could be dead in a ditch!
What were you thinking?

2040
01:40:08.667 --> 01:40:10.458
I trusted you and you lied to me.

2041
01:40:10.458 --> 01:40:12.958
‐ I...
‐ What is this?

2042
01:40:12.958 --> 01:40:14.583
What happened to my good girl?

2043
01:40:14.583 --> 01:40:17.000
Because this.
this is not the daughter I raised.

2044
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.125
‐ Maybe it is.
‐ Do not talk back at me.

2045
01:40:20.125 --> 01:40:23.375
‐ Maybe I'm not a good girl. Mommy.

2046
01:40:23.375 --> 01:40:27.792
Maybe I'm a terrible person
who deserves terrible things.

2047
01:40:27.792 --> 01:40:32.000
Maybe I should just stop trying
to be perfect for you all the time.

2048
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.417
because the me that makes mistakes.
the me that you don't know...

2049
01:40:36.708 --> 01:40:39.125
I feel like it's never
going to be good enough for you.

2050
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:06.417
ROSIE: Sunny?
[knocks on door]

2051
01:41:07.458 --> 01:41:08.875
[door opens]

2052
01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.583
Why do you think
you are a terrible person?

2053
01:41:37.792 --> 01:41:39.083
[sighs]

2054
01:41:43.583 --> 01:41:48.333
You know. growing up
I made a lot of mistakes.

2055
01:41:50.458 --> 01:41:51.875
And I was...

2056
01:41:53.708 --> 01:41:55.375
far from perfect.

2057
01:41:56.667 --> 01:41:58.708
Especially in my own mother's eyes.

2058
01:42:01.792 --> 01:42:04.458
My mother decided everything for me.

2059
01:42:05.417 --> 01:42:07.583
She talked at me. never with me.

2060
01:42:10.708 --> 01:42:13.958
I don't want our relationship
to be like that.

2061
01:42:33.667 --> 01:42:35.542
‐ I need a morning after pill.

2062
01:42:37.125 --> 01:42:40.125
I need the car because I needed to go
to the closest Planned Parenthood.

2063
01:42:40.125 --> 01:42:43.375
which is very far away.
and I tried to get it at a pharmacy here.

2064
01:42:43.375 --> 01:42:45.625
but the pharmacist refused
to sell me the pill.

2065
01:42:45.625 --> 01:42:47.458
so it turned into a wild goose chase.

2066
01:42:47.458 --> 01:42:50.667
‐ Wait. What do you mean he refused you?

2067
01:42:51.375 --> 01:42:53.625
‐ Good afternoon.
How may I help you?

2068
01:42:53.625 --> 01:42:58.292
‐ I need the Plan B pill.
for my daughter's friend.

2069
01:43:04.292 --> 01:43:05.375
‐ Okay.

2070
01:43:05.375 --> 01:43:07.083
LUPE:
So glad I'm here to see this.

2071
01:43:07.083 --> 01:43:08.708
‐ [sighs] Great.

2072
01:43:08.708 --> 01:43:12.250
Now. when we get home. you are both
cleaning all this mud in here.

2073
01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:13.917
It's a total mess!

2074
01:43:18.333 --> 01:43:19.667
