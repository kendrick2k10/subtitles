86
00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:26.000

<i>Brian's parents</i>

93
00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:44.467
{\an8}The family business
was food related machinery.

Hard working people.

96
00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:52.867
So Brian and Gabby
did know each other
casually in high school.

97
00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:54.367
but they never dated.

98
00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:57.100
<i>So their first official date</i>

99
00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:59.066

<i>over a mutual love</i>

101
00:05:11.867 --> 00:05:15.367
<i>Gabby was into</i>
<i>healthiness and fitness.</i>

102
00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:19.500
And Brian was more of a loner

103
00:05:19.567 --> 00:05:22.400
<i>and really hard core</i>
<i>about the outdoors.</i>

104
00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:27.400
And it didn't seem like
Brian Laundrie really had
that many friends.

105
00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:30.000
<i>There weren't a lot of.</i>
<i>you know. best friends</i>

<i>or close friends from his past</i>
<i>that we were able</i>

107
00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:36.100
But despite their differences.

108
00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:39.667
Gabby and Brian move in
with his parents
in North Port. Florida.

109

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.266
[Entin] <i>Not only was she close</i>
<i>with his parents.</i>

111
00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:48.400

People are creating brand new

114
00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:58.567

315

316
00:16:48.266 --> 00:16:51.567
<i>We got a phone call</i>
<i>from a detective in Florida.</i>

317
00:16:51.567 --> 00:16:53.867
And he had some information
about a credit card

318

in Jackson.

322
00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:14.100

when and where
Gabby and Brian were.

<i>My team went to the Shell</i>

326

<i>through hundreds of hours</i>

328

spot the van.

329
00:17:42.166 --> 00:17:45.367
[Det. Smith] <i>The camera</i>
<i>showed us the van</i>
<i>turning into Whole Foods.</i>

330
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.166
That's where we verified
that the van we had
was Gabby Petito's van

331
00:17:51.266 --> 00:17:53.166

333
00:17:57.166 --> 00:18:00.767
[Vick] <i>What's really</i>
<i>mind-blowing about</i>
<i>this footage from Whole Foods</i>

334
00:18:00.767 --> 00:18:04.200
is that it's likely
the last video image

335
00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:06.567
ever recorded of Gabby Petito.

336
00:18:06.567 --> 00:18:07.867
[suspenseful music playing]

337
00:18:11.467 --> 00:18:13.166
[Det. Smith] <i>They kind of</i>
<i>wandered around a bit.</i>

338
00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:14.767
looking at the store's goods.

339
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.467
[Sollis] <i>They are definitely</i>
<i>together and yet not together</i>

340
00:18:19.467 --> 00:18:22.567
<i>as they're going</i>
<i>through the store.</i>

341
00:18:22.567 --> 00:18:27.700
<i>They are maintaining a...</i>
<i>A distance pretty steadily.</i>

342
00:18:27.767 --> 00:18:30.100
<i>And her arms were...</i>
<i>Were crossed.</i>

343
00:18:30.166 --> 00:18:31.767
{\an8}So perhaps crossing the arms

344
00:18:31.767 --> 00:18:33.500
{\an8}provided her
a little bit of comfort

345
00:18:33.567 --> 00:18:36.166
{\an8}and it also might have
provided her a little bit
of distance from him.

346
00:18:36.166 --> 00:18:37.914
It was a way perhaps to...
To say like.

347
00:18:37.914 --> 00:18:38.000
It was a way perhaps to...
To say like.

348
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.367
"Hey. I'm protecting me."

349
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.200
[Det. Smith] <i>I didn't see</i>

351
00:18:49.667 --> 00:18:51.667
<i>And then. they left.</i>

352
00:18:51.667 --> 00:18:55.266
[Chapman] <i>The documentation</i>
<i>from surveillance</i>
<i>was crucial in this case</i>

353
00:18:55.266 --> 00:19:00.367
because it allowed
law enforcement
to track their whereabouts

354

{\an8}<i>at a restaurant.</i>
<i>Merry Piglets.</i>

359
00:19:14.567 --> 00:19:18.100
A detective of mine and I
interviewed the manager
of the restaurant

360
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.700
<i>and learned that</i>
<i>Gabby and Brian</i>

They then left
without paying for their bill.

363

A manager told me that someone
from the restaurant went out

364
00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:30.467
and asked them. you know.
were they gonna pay.

365
00:19:30.467 --> 00:19:32.700
They eventually paid the bill.

[Chapman] <i>The behavior</i>
<i>that they presented</i>
<i>at Merry Piglets</i>

368
00:19:38.367 --> 00:19:42.100

[Sollis] <i>It is understandable</i>

that if
their finances were low.

371
00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:50.800
that could be
a huge stressor for them.

419
00:23:29.367 --> 00:23:31.066
I would say a lot of people
who are abusers

are very good at.
when someone else is present.

putting on
a different appearance.

422
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.166
So. domestic violence
is 100% power and control.

423
00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:54.767
Everything he did.

424
00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:58.367
he stated he did
because he had to control her.

425
00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:01.667
Once the body camera video
came out from Moab. um.

426
00:24:01.667 --> 00:24:05.166
domestic violence survivors
from all over the world

427
00:24:05.166 --> 00:24:07.066
really zeroed in on this case.

428
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.200
{\an8}When I heard her talk
about him not believing in her

429
00:24:30.266 --> 00:24:32.300
{\an8}or thinking that
she could do anything...

430
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.800
{\an8}...then I knew that
she was in a bad spot.

431
00:24:51.467 --> 00:24:53.467
{\an8}Brian keeping her
out of the van.

432
00:24:53.467 --> 00:24:55.166
which was actually her van.

433
00:24:55.867 --> 00:24:57.266
so that's like if you took it

434
00:24:57.266 --> 00:24:58.700
and pretended
it was her house.

435
00:24:58.767 --> 00:25:01.266
he was keeping her
out of her house.

436
00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:03.266
So. that's an important factor
to consider.

437
00:25:03.266 --> 00:25:06.100
So he felt he had
the power and the authority

438
00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.367
to limit her access.

439
00:25:17.166 --> 00:25:19.667
[Williams] <i>Maybe the most</i>
<i>telling thing about the video</i>

440
00:25:19.667 --> 00:25:24.100
<i>is that the 9-1-1 call</i>
<i>describes a man</i>
<i>slapping a woman.</i>

441
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.000
{\an8}But Gabby describes herself
as the aggressor.

442
00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.767
{\an8}Whether somebody's talking
to law enforcement

443
00:25:40.767 --> 00:25:42.441
or a community member.
a family member.

444
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:43.000

a family member.

445
00:25:43.567 --> 00:25:45.266
about an abusive partner.

446
00:25:45.266 --> 00:25:48.700
<i>they are most likely going</i>
<i>to be a little protective</i>
<i>of that individual.</i>

447
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.367
{\an8}Again. it goes back
to domestic violence.

448
00:26:02.367 --> 00:26:05.266
trying to blame herself
to a certain extent.

449
00:26:05.266 --> 00:26:06.600
trying to protect him.

450
00:26:19.667 --> 00:26:22.667
{\an8}When someone is experiencing
abuse or violence

451
00:26:22.667 --> 00:26:23.800
{\an8}in their relationship.

452
00:26:23.867 --> 00:26:26.066
they will definitely
take the blame.

453
00:26:26.066 --> 00:26:27.367
They will definitely say.

454
00:26:27.367 --> 00:26:29.367
"It's my fault.
because I did this."

455
00:26:29.367 --> 00:26:31.767
and that's partly because
it's what they hear
all the time.

456
00:26:31.767 --> 00:26:33.367
It's always your fault.

put her hands under her head
and fell asleep.

569

in such a way

570

572

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.166
[Vick] <i>By late September.</i>

635
00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:10.200
<i>Gabby's Instagram</i>
<i>follower count had</i>
<i>pushed past 1 million.</i>

636
00:36:10.266 --> 00:36:13.400

637
00:36:13.467 --> 00:36:13.611
<i>social media goes wild</i>
<i>with crazy theories</i>

638
00:36:13.611 --> 00:36:14.000
<i>social media goes wild</i>
<i>with crazy theories</i>

639
00:36:16.367 --> 00:36:17.867
<i>about where Brian is.</i>

640
00:36:19.467 --> 00:36:22.867
{\an8}I don't personally
think that Brian is
in the Carlton Reserve.

641
00:36:22.867 --> 00:36:27.500
{\an8}Last night. a man said that
he found a noose on a tree.

642
00:36:27.567 --> 00:36:29.300
[Entin] <i>People in Oregon</i>
<i>and California.</i>

643
00:36:29.367 --> 00:36:31.400
<i>all the way</i>
<i>to the Appalachian Trail.</i>

644
00:36:31.467 --> 00:36:33.567
claiming. "I've seen
Brian Laundrie.

645
00:36:33.567 --> 00:36:34.700
I've got photos."

646
00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.066
There was a guy who said.
"I have him on my deer cam."

647
00:36:37.066 --> 00:36:39.567
"My lead is Brian Laundrie's
father's friend.

648
00:36:39.567 --> 00:36:41.767
I'm convinced
he's hiding in Mexico

649
00:36:41.767 --> 00:36:43.611
where he can't be extradited
to the United States."

650
00:36:43.611 --> 00:36:44.000
where he can't be extradited
to the United States."

651
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.166
Theories from Brian
being a fed

652
00:36:47.166 --> 00:36:48.400
to him having a clone...

653
00:36:48.467 --> 00:36:50.467
{\an8}People were saying
he was buried underground

654
00:36:50.467 --> 00:36:51.500
{\an8}in his parents' backyard.

655
00:36:51.567 --> 00:36:53.567
{\an8}being fed through a straw.

656
00:36:53.567 --> 00:36:55.400
{\an8}[Williams] <i>I mean.</i>
<i>it was all completely crazy.</i>

657
00:36:55.467 --> 00:36:57.100
{\an8}And then. out of nowhere.

658
00:36:57.166 --> 00:36:59.567
{\an8}Brian's parents finally decide
to speak up.

659
00:37:03.467 --> 00:37:05.867
{\an8}[Entin] <i>Police were searching</i>
<i>the Carlton Reserve</i>

660
00:37:05.867 --> 00:37:09.100
<i>for Brian Laundrie</i>
<i>for almost a month...</i>

661
00:37:09.166 --> 00:37:13.266
...because that is where
his parents said
that he last was.

662
00:37:13.266 --> 00:37:13.611
<i>And what was so strange</i>
<i>is Brian Laundrie's parents</i>

663
00:37:13.611 --> 00:37:14.000
<i>And what was so strange</i>
<i>is Brian Laundrie's parents</i>

664
00:37:17.066 --> 00:37:19.567
<i>went out one morning</i>
<i>to look for Brian.</i>

665
00:37:19.567 --> 00:37:21.867
and literally.
just within minutes.

666
00:37:21.867 --> 00:37:25.000
they find items belonging
to Brian Laundrie.

667
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.700
[Williams] <i>The parents contact</i>
<i>the police</i>

668
00:37:29.767 --> 00:37:31.967
and tell them
what area to focus on.

669
00:37:31.967 --> 00:37:34.266
And after searching
everywhere else for weeks.

670
00:37:34.266 --> 00:37:37.166
they almost immediately
find skeletal remains.

671
00:37:38.567 --> 00:37:40.567
[newscaster]
<i>Through a comparison</i>
<i>of dental records.</i>

672
00:37:40.567 --> 00:37:43.611
<i>the FBI was able to confirm</i>
<i>that the remains found</i>

673
00:37:43.611 --> 00:37:43.800
<i>the FBI was able to confirm</i>
<i>that the remains found</i>

674
00:37:43.867 --> 00:37:44.000
<i>were that of Brian Laundrie.</i>

675
00:37:48.367 --> 00:37:51.367
<i>A backpack and a notebook</i>
<i>believed to have belonged</i>
<i>to Laundrie</i>

676
00:37:51.367 --> 00:37:53.100

677
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.266
[Entin] <i>Everyone was waiting</i>
<i>for this notebook</i>

678
00:37:55.266 --> 00:37:57.266
that Brian Laundrie
had left behind.

679
00:37:58.166 --> 00:38:00.300
<i>and it was shocking</i>
<i>when we read it.</i>

680
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.467
Brian makes up
a ridiculous story

681
00:38:03.467 --> 00:38:05.467
that he had to kill Gabby

682
00:38:05.467 --> 00:38:09.400
to put her out of her misery
from an injury.

683
00:38:09.467 --> 00:38:12.367
[Entin] He wrote.
"When I pulled Gabby
out of the water.

684
00:38:12.367 --> 00:38:13.611
she couldn't tell me
what hurt.

685
00:38:13.611 --> 00:38:14.000
she couldn't tell me
what hurt.

686
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.166
<i>She had a small bump</i>
<i>on her forehead</i>

687
00:38:16.166 --> 00:38:17.800

688
00:38:17.867 --> 00:38:20.066
<i>Her feet hurt. her wrist hurt.</i>

689
00:38:20.066 --> 00:38:23.100
<i>but she was freezing.</i>
<i>shaking violently.</i>

690
00:38:23.166 --> 00:38:27.100
While carrying her.
she continually made
sounds of pain.

691
00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.300
<i>begging for an end</i>
<i>to her pain.</i>

692
00:38:29.867 --> 00:38:31.166
<i>I ended her life.</i>

693
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.767

694
00:38:33.767 --> 00:38:35.400
<i>that it is what she wanted.</i>

695
00:38:35.467 --> 00:38:38.000

<i>Gabby hated</i>

699
00:38:46.166 --> 00:38:49.700
I mean. she died
of blunt force trauma
and strangulation.

700
00:38:49.767 --> 00:38:53.367
One second. you're talking
about how you committed
this mercy killing.

701
00:38:53.367 --> 00:38:55.867
and then you're telling people
not to litter at the end?

702
00:38:55.867 --> 00:38:58.066
Uh. just very strange
and bizarre.

703
00:39:00.066 --> 00:39:02.000
[Williams] <i>I think most folks</i>
<i>have a pretty good idea</i>

704
00:39:02.066 --> 00:39:04.967
about what happened
in Grand Teton National Park.

705
00:39:06.667 --> 00:39:09.166
[Allen-Emrich] <i>I believe</i>
<i>she says. "I'm done."</i>

706
00:39:10.266 --> 00:39:12.066
{\an8}And once he heard that.

707
00:39:12.066 --> 00:39:13.611
{\an8}he was enraged.

708
00:39:13.611 --> 00:39:13.867
{\an8}he was enraged.

709
00:39:13.867 --> 00:39:14.000
{\an8}He was angry.

710
00:39:15.066 --> 00:39:19.767
<i>angry enough to throttle her</i>
<i>and kill her.</i>

711
00:39:24.667 --> 00:39:26.667
[Vick] <i>Some believe</i>
<i>that he staged her body</i>

712
00:39:26.667 --> 00:39:28.700
<i>to make it seem like</i>
<i>she died of natural causes</i>

713
00:39:28.767 --> 00:39:30.000
<i>in her sleep.</i>

714
00:39:30.066 --> 00:39:32.200
<i>and then ran home</i>
<i>to his mom and dad.</i>

715
00:39:34.567 --> 00:39:37.200
After he did this.
he gets in her van

716
00:39:37.266 --> 00:39:39.467
<i>and he drove right back</i>
<i>to North Port. Florida.</i>

717
00:39:39.467 --> 00:39:41.767
<i>pulled that van</i>
<i>into his parents' driveway.</i>

718
00:39:41.767 --> 00:39:43.611
<i>uh. and didn't talk</i>
<i>to anybody.</i>

719
00:39:43.611 --> 00:39:43.867
<i>uh. and didn't talk</i>
<i>to anybody.</i>

720
00:39:43.867 --> 00:39:44.000
And what happened
behind the scenes.

721
00:39:45.667 --> 00:39:46.967
we still don't really know.

722
00:39:46.967 --> 00:39:48.066
That's one
of the big mysteries.

723
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.767
[Vick] <i>There's a kind of</i>
<i>tragic irony here.</i>

724
00:39:56.767 --> 00:40:00.800
{\an8}Gabby Petito finally got
the kind of international fame

725
00:40:00.867 --> 00:40:05.000
{\an8}that most social media
influencers would
only dream of.

726

727

<i>and a hashtag that was shared</i>
<i>a billion times.</i>

728
00:40:09.667 --> 00:40:13.000
<i>But it came</i>
<i>at the cost of her life.</i>

729
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:13.611
[Entin] <i>It's really sad</i>

...and if only
she was alive now

732
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.467
to see how many
followers she had.

733
00:40:23.867 --> 00:40:25.467
[Vick] <i>Gabby's</i>
<i>social media pages</i>

734
00:40:25.467 --> 00:40:27.767
<i>allowed anyone to see</i>
<i>what she posted</i>

735
00:40:27.767 --> 00:40:30.000
<i>in the final days</i>

{\an8}[Williams] <i>The question</i>
<i>everybody wants to know...</i>

737

{\an8}<i>What did the Laundries know?</i>

738
00:40:40.567 --> 00:40:42.667
Did they know
their son's intention?

00:40:42.667 --> 00:40:43.611
Did they know that he was dead

Did they know that he was dead
the whole time?

741
00:40:45.467 --> 00:40:48.567
{\an8}This new civil lawsuit.
uh. has now been filed

742
00:40:48.567 --> 00:40:50.700
{\an8}by Gabby Petito's family.

743
00:40:50.767 --> 00:40:54.000

[Entin] <i>The Petitos claim</i>
<i>that at that time.</i>

745

uh. the Laundries knew
that Petito was dead.

746
00:40:59.767 --> 00:41:02.467
that obviously. the search
was gonna be unsuccessful.

747
00:41:02.467 --> 00:41:04.200
and that they weren't
telling anyone.

748
00:41:04.266 --> 00:41:06.400
<i>and that that caused</i>
<i>pain and suffering.</i>

749
