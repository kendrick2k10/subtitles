She's tagged her again!

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:20.167
- Oh and again.
- Oh. shit.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:22.792
Katrina's in trouble.
She's in trouble. Mike.

8
00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:23.625
Big trouble.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:26.042
- [Mike] Can she finish
it. right here. right now?

10
00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:28.000
- [Commentator] Oh. she
shot her to the body!

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.458
Katrina's in huge trouble. Mike.

- Boom. that's it!
- Oh. my goodness!

Oh. my goodness! What a fall
from grace!

You know. the next town's
60 miles from here.

37
00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:46.958
They got a bus station there.
and a bar.

Hey.

hurting me.

00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:01.750

43
00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:04.000

Beautiful. isn't it?

48
00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:38.458
The way everything just
disappears into the darkness.

49
00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:47.208
They say smoking's bad for you.

50
00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:49.375
But if that was true.

51
00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:51.500

have created tobacco?

You smell of pot.

56
00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.542
I got a nose for that.

57
00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.917

I wrote a few songs. sermons and
sets.

72
00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:47.500
- That's really interesting.

73
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.125
- Just using my talents
to further his work.

74
00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:54.500
You ever heard of the prosperity
gospel?

75
00:05:55.917 --> 00:05:57.500
- Nope.
- Oh. sure you have.

76
00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:01.125
If you give a little to the
ministry.

77
00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:02.667
you get a lot from the Lord.

78
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.542
Don't ask why. It's a miracle.

79
00:06:05.542 --> 00:06:08.042
Jesus wants you to have
abundance.

80
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.250
Prosperity gospel.

81
00:06:12.292 --> 00:06:13.292
That was my idea.

82
00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.083
They stole it from me.

83
00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:19.167
I even designed a coin.

84
00:06:20.292 --> 00:06:21.333
Limited edition.

85
00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:24.792
On one side. you had Jesus.

86
00:06:24.792 --> 00:06:29.792
and on the other. you had
an AR-15 rifle and an eagle.

87
00:06:30.042 --> 00:06:32.417
all wrapped up in the stars and
stripes.

88
00:06:33.417 --> 00:06:36.250
That majestic bird. staring up
to heaven.

89
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.458
How much do you think people
would give for that coin?

90
00:06:41.458 --> 00:06:44.708
Pass it down on their deathbed.
clutch it to their chest.

91
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.458
- God knows.
(driver chuckles)

92
00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:49.833
- Exactly.

93
00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:51.500
You got a quick wit.

94
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.792
Can I get an Amen?

95
00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:56.625
- I'll pass.
(driver chuckles)

96
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:57.833
- Am I annoying you yet?

97
00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:03.917
Now where did you get that scar?

98
00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.208
- What scar?

99
00:07:06.208 --> 00:07:08.958
- Oh. the one between
the wings on your neck.

100
00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:16.750
Did I touch a nerve. sister?

101
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.500

(engine hums)

102
00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:55.417

(handle clicks)

104
00:07:58.292 --> 00:08:00.125

sister.

105
00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:03.625
- Unlock the door.

106
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.000
- But wouldn't you like
a smoke for the road?

107
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.583
- Unlock the door.

108
00:08:10.583 --> 00:08:12.167
(driver chuckles)

109
00:08:12.167 --> 00:08:15.500
- But I've been looking for
you everywhere. Katrina Bash.

110
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.708
And hallelujah. I've found you.

111

- Destination?

123

- Where can I get to for 80
bucks?

124
00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:30.083
- A lot of places better than
here.

125
00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:37.250
When you know where you're
going. I'm right here.

126
00:10:39.167 --> 00:10:40.208
- Mine it is.

127
00:10:40.208 --> 00:10:41.958
- A rather good choice.

128
00:10:43.167 --> 00:10:44.083

- You know. non-alcohol beer...

132
00:11:42.167 --> 00:11:44.625
Is worse for you than alcoholic
beer.

133
00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:47.375
It's full of additives and shit.

134
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.667
It's like cancer in a glass.

135
00:11:56.292 --> 00:11:58.875

- [Katrina] Water.

138
00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:20.042
- You're in luck.

139
00:12:20.042 --> 00:12:21.875
No charge for water on ladies
night.

140
00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:24.708
- I'd prefer tequila.

141
00:12:27.042 --> 00:12:28.667
Except. I don't have any money.

142
00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.792
- Just another no-good drifter!

143
00:12:35.583 --> 00:12:39.250
I'd buy you a drink. but I
don't need a handjob tonight.

144
00:12:41.042 --> 00:12:43.958
Besides. (sniffs) you stink.

145
00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.542
You smell like an ashtray

153
00:13:22.792 --> 00:13:24.333
(sighs) And urine.

154
00:13:25.542 --> 00:13:27.250
Bodily fluids in general.

155
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.708
- I'll stick with water.

156
00:13:31.042 --> 00:13:31.958
- You clean that up.

157
00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958
and I'll fill your glass
to the brim with tequila.

158
00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.500
And I'll keep it coming. You
drink as much as you want.

159
00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:44.083
And you can stay the night
in the drunk tank out back.

164

while.

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:57.208
It's vacant tonight.

166
00:13:58.792 --> 00:14:00.292
Unless you're too good for it?

167
00:14:01.125 --> 00:14:02.750
- I'm not too good for anything.

168
00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:06.708
Throw in two packs.

169
00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:16.125
- I tell ya.

170
00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:18.333
Cans are usually more disgusting
tonight.

171
00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:27.375
Deal's a deal.

demapo from Tijuana.

175
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.000
- As long it helps me forget.

176
00:15:01.042 --> 00:15:02.333

- Used to.

182
00:18:23.417 --> 00:18:24.667

183
00:18:24.667 --> 00:18:27.292
your tequila selection since
last night?

184
00:18:27.292 --> 00:18:28.125
- Nope.

185
00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:30.167
Stayin' another night?

186
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.167
- Probably.

187
00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:34.542
- You gonna clean up again at
close?

188
00:18:34.542 --> 00:18:36.917
- That's the plan.

189
00:18:36.917 --> 00:18:38.708
Can't get any worse than last
night.

190
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
- So. what's the next move.
drifter?

191
00:18:58.583 --> 00:19:00.875
- I don't have any more moves.

192
00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:02.458
- Drink herself to death!

193
00:19:03.833 --> 00:19:04.667
- That'll work.

194
00:19:08.667 --> 00:19:10.500
Barkeep. could I get an ashtray?

195
00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:14.958
- What a clueless bitch.

196
00:19:17.167 --> 00:19:18.875
You can't drink yourself to
death.

197
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.250
If you're already dead.

198
00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.667
(long-haired man chuckles)

199
00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:26.625
Oh. you must be some
brain-damaged hoe.

200
00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:30.000
- Oh. we've all got a little hoe
in us.

201
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.292
and we're all on our way to
death.

202
00:19:31.292 --> 00:19:33.167
Barkeep. can you hit me again.
please?

203
00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:39.458
- Barkeep.

204
00:19:39.458 --> 00:19:41.167
How do you make a lesbian
vampire?

205
00:19:43.125 --> 00:19:45.375
- We don't do that kinda
trendy shit. You know that.

206
00:19:45.375 --> 00:19:46.667
- Nothin' trendy about it.

207
00:19:47.542 --> 00:19:49.083
This is a timeless drink.

208
00:19:49.083 --> 00:19:50.208
Highball glass.

209
00:19:51.167 --> 00:19:53.167
Don't bother washing
it from the last drunk.

210
00:19:53.167 --> 00:19:55.250
Just wipe it with a dirty rag.

211
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.667
Two shots little raw whiskey.

212
00:19:57.667 --> 00:19:59.708
Two shots Russian piss vodka.

213
00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:00.542
And the rest?

214
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.750
Mad Dog. Ripple.

215
00:20:03.625 --> 00:20:06.250
Whatever wino shit you
can get from the gutter.

216
00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:07.833
And no ice.

217
00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:08.958
That's for faggots.

218
00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:13.708
Then...

219
00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:18.667
You cut some part of the body.
(chuckles)

220
00:20:19.917 --> 00:20:20.750
Your body.

221
00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:24.875
Somebody else's body.

222
00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:25.708
Doesn't matter.

223
00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:31.875
Then you drip. drip. drip
the blood in. (chuckles)

224
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.417
That's the cherry.

225
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:38.042
The coup de grace. like the
frogs say.

226
00:20:39.208 --> 00:20:40.583
- You forgot the umbrella.

227
00:20:41.625 --> 00:20:42.583
- What did you say?

228
00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:50.042
- I said. you're a
mouth-breathing knuckle-dragger.

229
00:20:50.042 --> 00:20:51.625
- What?
- Ah!

230
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.333
And a deaf-mute. too.

231
00:20:54.375 --> 00:20:56.417
Get outta here before you get
hurt.

232
00:20:56.417 --> 00:20:58.042
- [Bald Man] Before who gets
hurt?

233
00:20:59.917 --> 00:21:03.333
- Time to go. Viper.
(tense music)

234
00:21:08.583 --> 00:21:12.625
- There ain't no such thing
as a vampire cocktail.

235
00:21:12.625 --> 00:21:14.958
- You shut your beak.
you waste-of-life boozer.

236
00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:16.792
Worthless drunk.

237
00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:20.625
- They say it's a disease!

238
00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:22.125
- You're a fuckin' disease.

239
00:21:25.708 --> 00:21:27.417
What're you gonna do about it.
bitch?

240
00:21:28.917 --> 00:21:30.042
Some vigilante shit?

241
00:21:30.917 --> 00:21:32.000
I don't think so.

242
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
(glass shatters)
(moody electronic music)

243
00:21:38.875 --> 00:21:41.125
(thud)

244
00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:43.917
(gun fires)

245
00:21:43.917 --> 00:21:46.417
(body clunks)

246
00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:49.542
- Hit the road. Viper.

247
00:21:49.542 --> 00:21:50.875
That's enough for tonight.

248
00:21:53.625 --> 00:21:55.542
- You get rid of one worthless
drunk.

249
00:21:55.542 --> 00:21:57.750
another one pops up
right back in his place.

250
00:21:58.875 --> 00:22:00.083
Right. Cucaracha?

251
00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:03.000
Look at me. you dumb broad!

252
00:22:04.792 --> 00:22:06.542
We're gonna match now. sister.
see.

253
00:22:07.583 --> 00:22:10.417
(flesh squelches)

254
00:22:11.292 --> 00:22:12.833
(grunts)

255
00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:14.542
Like I said.

256
00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:17.583
You're already dead. HellKat.
(chuckles)

257
00:22:17.583 --> 00:22:19.417
Started from the bottom?

258
00:22:19.417 --> 00:22:20.500
Welcome back.

259
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.625
See you soon.

260
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:29.750
(thud)
(drunk groans)

261
00:22:50.917 --> 00:22:51.750
- Again.

262
00:23:14.333 --> 00:23:16.750
(dark music)

263
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.917
What the hell?

264
00:23:30.167 --> 00:23:31.417
- Closing time. drifter.

265
00:23:34.042 --> 00:23:36.792
- Okay. what is this?

266
00:23:36.792 --> 00:23:38.667
- What is what?

267
00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:39.750
- [Katrina] Two moons.

268
00:23:42.625 --> 00:23:44.042
- Maybe tequila moons.

269
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.792
- I think you've got something
to tell me.

270
00:23:52.458 --> 00:23:53.750
- Wish I could. kitty cat.

271
00:23:55.583 --> 00:23:56.542
It's not my job.

272
00:23:58.042 --> 00:24:00.083
- Okay. what is going on here?

273
00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:02.917
You all know me. I don't know
you.

274
00:24:04.958 --> 00:24:05.792
What's your name?

275
00:24:07.792 --> 00:24:08.875
- I don't have a name.

276
00:24:10.333 --> 00:24:11.333
I'm just a barkeep.

277
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.833
(bluesy music)

278
00:24:35.208 --> 00:24:37.875
(ominous music)

279
00:24:54.083 --> 00:24:57.917
(eerie dissonant tones)

280
00:24:57.917 --> 00:25:00.208
Basements don't need cleaning.

281
00:25:00.208 --> 00:25:01.500
Just the bathrooms.

282
00:25:18.292 --> 00:25:20.958
(Katrina sighs)

283
00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:25.917
(Katrina sighs)

284
00:25:25.917 --> 00:25:27.792
- What the hell?

285
00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:30.958
(bluesy music)

286
00:25:30.958 --> 00:25:33.458
(door creaks)

287
00:25:39.958 --> 00:25:41.542
- You do good cleaning work.

288
00:25:42.542 --> 00:25:43.375
- Right.

289
00:25:45.917 --> 00:25:47.500
Tequila?

290
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.792
(barkeep chuckles)

291
00:25:48.792 --> 00:25:51.042
- You sure can drink.
but last call's over.

292
00:25:52.917 --> 00:25:55.625
I'm not permitted to serve after
closing.

293
00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:57.125
- Seriously?

294
00:25:57.125 --> 00:25:59.833
Our deal was I drink whenever I
want.

295
00:25:59.833 --> 00:26:01.833
- [Barkeep] Not after closing.

296
00:26:01.833 --> 00:26:03.458
- Well. isn't this your bar?

297
00:26:03.458 --> 00:26:05.667
- No.
- Well. who owns it then?

298
00:26:05.667 --> 00:26:07.917
- I do.
(ominous tones)

299
00:26:07.917 --> 00:26:10.708
I own your entire world now.
Katrina.

300
00:26:14.833 --> 00:26:17.792
Party's about to begin. HellKat.

301
00:26:17.792 --> 00:26:18.625
Are you ready?

302
00:26:19.875 --> 00:26:23.292
(moody electronic music)

303
00:26:37.208 --> 00:26:39.542
- [Announcer] And in the
blue corner. the challenger.

304
00:26:39.542 --> 00:26:42.125
Fighting out of Albuquerque. New
Mexico.

305
00:26:42.125 --> 00:26:45.125
the number one ranked women's
middleweight in the world.

306
00:26:45.125 --> 00:26:47.625
Katrina Bash HellKat!

307
00:26:58.125 --> 00:27:01.083
(tense music)

308
00:27:01.083 --> 00:27:03.208
- (chuckles) Oh. look.

309
00:27:03.208 --> 00:27:05.083
How bewitching the moons are
tonight.

310
00:27:09.625 --> 00:27:13.125
(chuckles) You know. you can
tell a lot about a person

311
00:27:13.125 --> 00:27:14.542
by what's in their backpack.

312
00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:19.417
Dope?

313
00:27:19.417 --> 00:27:20.542
Or is it catnip?

314
00:27:22.292 --> 00:27:23.125
- Meow.

315
00:27:25.417 --> 00:27:27.667
- Oh. look. She's a reader.

316
00:27:28.583 --> 00:27:31.500
- [Friend] Probably that
prosperity gospel shit.

317
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.292
- Look at this butch-ass wallet.

318
00:27:33.292 --> 00:27:34.333
What do we have here?

319
00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:38.917
- Broke-ass bitch.

320
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:48.167
- Look at this little faggot.

321
00:27:50.583 --> 00:27:51.833
(moody electronic music)

322
00:27:51.833 --> 00:27:53.750
(thud)

323
00:27:55.250 --> 00:28:00.167
(flesh squelches)
(groans)

324
00:28:01.375 --> 00:28:04.500
(body clunks)

325
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.083
(gun fires)

326
00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:09.417
(gun fires)

327
00:28:12.667 --> 00:28:15.167
(body clunks)

328
00:28:20.167 --> 00:28:22.500
(barkeep pants)

329
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.500
- Katrina. are you okay?

330
00:28:27.667 --> 00:28:29.083
- Hello. HellKat.

331
00:28:39.583 --> 00:28:42.750
I'd offer you cigarette.
but this is my last one.

332
00:28:44.167 --> 00:28:45.208
The fuck is that?

333
00:28:47.583 --> 00:28:50.542
- Evening. kids. (chuckles)

334
00:28:52.042 --> 00:28:52.958
What're you staring at?

335
00:28:52.958 --> 00:28:55.083
- You got something on
your shirt. Dominus.

336
00:28:56.333 --> 00:28:57.167
Pocket.

337
00:28:58.958 --> 00:29:01.792
(Dominus chuckles)

338
00:29:01.792 --> 00:29:04.458
- Now the party really has
started.

339
00:29:04.458 --> 00:29:07.667
We even got hors d'oeuvres.
(chuckles)

340
00:29:08.875 --> 00:29:11.708
(flesh squelches)

341
00:29:15.417 --> 00:29:17.250
Mm. (chuckles)

342
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:20.292
Just like an oyster.
except for the aftertaste.

343
00:29:20.292 --> 00:29:21.625
(chuckles)

344
00:29:21.625 --> 00:29:22.917
Better than liver. though.

345
00:29:23.917 --> 00:29:27.292
My momma used to make us eat
liver every Friday night.

346
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.208
'Cause that weren't meat.
see. that was an organ.

347
00:29:32.125 --> 00:29:36.208
and I used to keep it
balled up in my cheek.

348
00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:39.542
Looked like a little chipmunk.
(chuckles)

349
00:29:41.042 --> 00:29:43.375
And I'd run round the back of
the house.

350
00:29:43.375 --> 00:29:45.792
and I'd spit it in the lake.

351
00:29:45.792 --> 00:29:47.458
Till one day. she caught me.

352
00:29:49.375 --> 00:29:51.458
And then I learned to love
liver.

353
00:29:51.458 --> 00:29:55.125
I learned to love all organs.
(chuckles)

354
00:29:56.958 --> 00:29:57.917
Let's play a game.

355
00:29:59.667 --> 00:30:02.958
It's called whoever wins the
fight.

356
00:30:02.958 --> 00:30:05.583
gets to leave the bar alive.

357
00:30:05.583 --> 00:30:09.583
It's a catchy title. isn't it?
(chuckles)

358
00:30:09.583 --> 00:30:11.292
You ever seen one of these
before?

359
00:30:12.333 --> 00:30:15.000
Ah. it's enchanting.

360
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.292
Whoever says the magic word gets
it.

361
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.083
(thug speaks foreign language)

362
00:30:23.083 --> 00:30:26.500
(speaks foreign language)

363
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.167
(ominous music)

364
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.708
(chuckles)

365
00:30:32.708 --> 00:30:34.167
(taser zaps)

366
00:30:34.167 --> 00:30:36.833
(Katrina moans)

367
00:30:37.958 --> 00:30:39.583
- Get up. bitch.

368
00:30:39.583 --> 00:30:40.417
Hit me!

369
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.208
Fucking hit me!

370
00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:47.708
(thuds)
(bones crack)

371
00:30:49.708 --> 00:30:52.083
(grunts)

372
00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:57.083
- Why. that's quite the
statement. (chuckles)

373
00:30:57.667 --> 00:31:00.042
- I should kill you.

374
00:31:00.042 --> 00:31:00.917
- Kill me?

375
00:31:02.167 --> 00:31:04.083
Oh. you're fuckin' high. sister.

376
00:31:05.125 --> 00:31:06.208
And not on life.

377
00:31:07.208 --> 00:31:09.792
Let's not spend any more
valuable time together.

378
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.417
- Keep your distance.

379
00:31:15.583 --> 00:31:16.875
(Dominus chuckles)

380
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:19.167
- What kind of a mother are you
anyway?

381
00:31:23.375 --> 00:31:27.333
The kind who doesn't give
a shit about her own son.

382
00:31:27.333 --> 00:31:28.958
Leaves him to die.

383
00:31:30.375 --> 00:31:34.833
A narcissist who put her
career in front of her family.

384
00:31:36.583 --> 00:31:40.833
If you could call that
a career. or a family.

385
00:31:42.042 --> 00:31:47.250
Just feels like a pathetic
waste of space to me.

386
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.125
(chuckles)

387
00:31:49.125 --> 00:31:51.667
You made it to the big leagues.

388
00:31:51.667 --> 00:31:54.333
but you couldn't close the deal.
could ya?

389
00:31:55.667 --> 00:31:59.667
And what a heavy price
you paid for failure.

390
00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:01.958
(chuckles)

391
00:32:01.958 --> 00:32:03.167
I can't remember.

392
00:32:04.417 --> 00:32:09.375
Have I complemented you on
your neck tattoo? (chuckles)

393
00:32:12.583 --> 00:32:15.167
(Katrina sobs)

394
00:32:18.958 --> 00:32:21.208
(chuckles)

395
00:32:25.042 --> 00:32:29.875
(Katrina sobs)
(chuckles)

396
00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:42.083
Do you need a hug?

397
00:32:42.083 --> 00:32:44.333
(chuckles)

398
00:32:47.917 --> 00:32:48.750
Atonement.

399
00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:52.250
Oh. how sweet the sound.

400
00:32:53.167 --> 00:32:55.917
"If I could just have another
chance!"

401
00:33:01.667 --> 00:33:06.042
Well. here you are. (chuckles)

402
00:33:06.042 --> 00:33:07.208
Look familiar?

403
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.917
You have no idea. (chuckles)

404
00:33:13.292 --> 00:33:16.375
Keep watchin'. (chuckles)

405
00:33:16.375 --> 00:33:19.958
It's better if you get it in
the full-screen experience.

406
00:33:19.958 --> 00:33:22.208
(chuckles)

407
00:33:40.667 --> 00:33:43.417
(glass shatters)

408
00:34:24.083 --> 00:34:26.208
(flesh squelches)

409
00:34:26.208 --> 00:34:30.125
(Katrina coughs)
(flesh squelches)

410
00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:33.958
You gettin' it now? (chuckles)
(bluesy music)

411
00:34:37.917 --> 00:34:40.667
You might need one of these
when you hear the next bit.

412
00:34:49.958 --> 00:34:51.750
- I quit.

413
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:52.917
- Oh.

414
00:34:52.917 --> 00:34:54.292
Congratulations.

415
00:34:55.375 --> 00:34:57.417
Too bad you didn't do it
earlier. though.

416
00:34:58.417 --> 00:35:01.000
'Cause you left one
smoldering in the ashtray.

417
00:35:02.583 --> 00:35:04.125
Burned the whole motel down.

418
00:35:05.542 --> 00:35:07.250
Killed an entire family.

419
00:35:08.167 --> 00:35:09.375
Mommy.

420
00:35:09.375 --> 00:35:10.833
Daddy.

421
00:35:10.833 --> 00:35:12.583
Baby girl.

422
00:35:12.583 --> 00:35:14.292
A little kiddie. too.

423
00:35:14.292 --> 00:35:15.708
(chuckles)

424
00:35:15.708 --> 00:35:17.125
Oh. the irony.

425
00:35:18.125 --> 00:35:20.792
See. you can't help it. Katrina.

426
00:35:20.792 --> 00:35:24.167
You destroy everything you
touch.

427
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.833
They were just poor white trash
anyway.

428
00:35:27.833 --> 00:35:31.458
so nobody gave a shit.
(chuckles)

429
00:35:31.458 --> 00:35:33.125
Back to more important things.

430
00:35:34.292 --> 00:35:37.083
Like what the hell is going on
here.

431
00:35:37.083 --> 00:35:39.500
Just hold your horses. little
lady.

432
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:43.500
All I need from you is
a digital signature.

433
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.292
and I'll let the cat out of the
bag.

434
00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:51.458
If we can find the will.
(chuckles)

435
00:35:55.875 --> 00:35:56.667
- What can I do?

436
00:35:59.167 --> 00:36:01.667
- The boy gets another
spin at the vida loca.

437
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:06.250
All you have to do is put on a
good show.

438
00:36:12.625 --> 00:36:14.458
Self-correction.

439
00:36:14.458 --> 00:36:16.417
You gotta win the tournament.

440
00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:20.667
Old-school. O.G. UFC one.

441
00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:24.375
But I know you can do it.
HellKat.

442
00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:25.417
I'm a believer.

443
00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:30.042
There's a special place inside
me reserved for dark horses.

444
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.750
I'll be looking out for you.

445
00:36:34.958 --> 00:36:39.583
So just stare your eyeball real
close into the screen there.

446
00:36:39.583 --> 00:36:41.417
Retina scan.

447
00:36:41.417 --> 00:36:44.042
State your full name. loud and
clear.

448
00:36:45.083 --> 00:36:46.583
and we'll call that a deal.

449
00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:50.458
- Katrina Bash.

450
00:36:55.583 --> 00:36:57.042
Katrina Bashinski.

451
00:37:06.042 --> 00:37:10.083
- Doesn't quite roll off the
tongue. does it? (chuckles)

452
00:37:14.875 --> 00:37:17.375
(door creaks)

453
00:37:20.083 --> 00:37:23.500

454
00:37:55.625 --> 00:37:57.875

(Katrina pants)

471
00:40:40.917 --> 00:40:41.750
- HellKat.

472
00:40:45.292 --> 00:40:46.125
HellKat!

473
00:40:48.917 --> 00:40:52.750
The proud are laid low
and the humble exalted!

474
00:41:03.125 --> 00:41:05.625
(body clunks)

475
00:41:10.417 --> 00:41:12.167
You're a bloody mess!

476
00:41:14.708 --> 00:41:16.042
Don't move!

477
00:41:16.042 --> 00:41:17.625
Almost done!

478
00:41:17.625 --> 00:41:20.833
(Katrina whines)

479
00:41:20.833 --> 00:41:23.458
- What the hell?
- Indeed!

480
00:41:23.458 --> 00:41:25.917
(Katrina whines)

481
00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:28.583
(Katrina pants)

482
00:41:35.292 --> 00:41:37.542
You won't feel a thing.

483
00:41:37.542 --> 00:41:39.042
(blowtorch hisses)

484
00:41:39.042 --> 00:41:42.375
Just kidding of course. (laughs
wildly)

485
00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:45.208
(Katrina screams)

486
00:41:46.208 --> 00:41:49.042
Fixing you up for your next
fight!

487
00:41:52.625 --> 00:41:55.292
(Katrina pants)

488
00:41:56.333 --> 00:41:57.917
You can get up now.

489
00:42:04.875 --> 00:42:07.542
(Katrina pants)

490
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:11.583
Gratitude?

491
00:42:13.667 --> 00:42:14.875
- What about it?

492
00:42:14.875 --> 00:42:16.167
- You should try it!

493
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.542
- You know where you are?

494
00:42:21.542 --> 00:42:23.458
- She has no idea.

495
00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:25.500
- I believe she does.

496
00:42:27.667 --> 00:42:28.583
- I've gone crazy?

497
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:31.583
- Not yet.

498
00:42:33.708 --> 00:42:34.875
- I'm in hell?

499
00:42:34.875 --> 00:42:35.917
- [Doctor] Not quite.

500
00:42:37.583 --> 00:42:38.542
- I'm starving?

501
00:42:39.667 --> 00:42:41.542
- We have an infinite supply.

502
00:42:41.542 --> 00:42:43.750
Chips and jerky.

503
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:45.708
- What more could you want in
life?

504
00:42:46.667 --> 00:42:48.750
(food crunches)

505
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:52.500
(suspenseful music)

506
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.333
- Fish!

507
00:42:57.917 --> 00:42:59.083
Are you ready?

508
00:43:03.625 --> 00:43:06.083
Are you gonna piss your pants?

509
00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:08.333
(chuckles)

510
00:43:09.708 --> 00:43:11.292
Oh.

511
00:43:11.292 --> 00:43:12.792
What a cliche.

512
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:17.792
Glad I didn't ask if you
were shittin' yourself.

513
00:43:17.792 --> 00:43:20.042
(chuckles)

514
00:43:21.667 --> 00:43:25.208
You signed up for this. so
let's not make a biggie of it.

515
00:43:26.375 --> 00:43:28.917
- Who am I fighting?
- You mean what.

516
00:43:30.375 --> 00:43:33.083
- What?
- (laughs) Yeah.

517
00:43:33.083 --> 00:43:34.792
What are you fightin'.

518
00:43:36.583 --> 00:43:38.917
A most charming critter. indeed.

519
00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:45.417
Because today's the day the
teddy bears have their picnic.

520
00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:48.708
(laughs)

521
00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:08.917

00:44:52.333 --> 00:44:55.000
(fighter roars)

526
00:45:18.375 --> 00:45:20.083
(dark piano music)

527
00:45:20.083 --> 00:45:24.167
(grunts)
(thuds)

528
00:45:25.875 --> 00:45:27.958

00:45:32.792 --> 00:45:35.458
(fighter roars)

531
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:39.667
(thud)

532
00:45:49.583 --> 00:45:52.083
(Fish groans)

533
00:45:56.750 --> 00:46:00.833
(grunts)
(thuds)

534
00:46:03.292 --> 00:46:05.125
(bones crack)

535
00:46:05.125 --> 00:46:07.208
(laughs)

536
00:46:10.542 --> 00:46:12.542
(fighter roars)

537
00:46:12.542 --> 00:46:13.375
- No!

538
00:46:16.667 --> 00:46:18.750
(groans)

539
00:46:20.083 --> 00:46:22.750
(fighter roars)

540
00:46:28.542 --> 00:46:31.583
(flesh squelches)

541
00:46:31.583 --> 00:46:33.875
- What the fuck?

542
00:46:33.875 --> 00:46:34.708
What happened?

543
00:46:36.917 --> 00:46:40.042
- Somebody won. somebody lost.

544
00:46:40.042 --> 00:46:42.375
- What happens to somebody who
lost?

545
00:46:42.375 --> 00:46:43.667
- That depends.

546
00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:48.333
If somebody is of the
nether. they cease to exist.

547
00:46:48.333 --> 00:46:51.208
If somebody is human.
they become of the nether.

548
00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:53.500
- They become a fucking monster?

549
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.625
- Not that they are aware of.

550
00:46:55.625 --> 00:46:57.083
- Oh. what a relief.

551
00:46:57.083 --> 00:46:59.333
- You are here of your own
doings.

552
00:46:59.333 --> 00:47:02.750
Your actions brought you here.

553
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:05.333
Be grateful you have one last
chance.

554
00:47:05.333 --> 00:47:08.583
And be thankful I'm here to help
you.

555
00:47:11.458 --> 00:47:12.875
- [Male Fighter] Better warm up.

556
00:47:14.583 --> 00:47:16.333
(thuds)

557
00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:17.792
- By hitting that meat bag?

558
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.625
How do you prepare for a
giant mother nether fuck?

559
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:23.583
- Lubricate.

560
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:28.667
- Try fuckin' this. (chuckles)

561
00:47:28.667 --> 00:47:31.917
(flesh squelches)

562
00:47:31.917 --> 00:47:33.375
Save your energy. sister.

563
00:47:34.792 --> 00:47:38.500
You're gonna need it and you're
beginning to piss me off.

564
00:47:43.292 --> 00:47:44.500
You're up in five.

565
00:47:45.917 --> 00:47:46.750
Lubricate.

566
00:47:51.875 --> 00:47:54.250
(door closes)

567
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:55.667
- This is it.

568
00:47:55.667 --> 00:47:56.958
Fuck me.

569
00:47:56.958 --> 00:47:58.583
I'm done.

570
00:47:58.583 --> 00:48:00.125
- [Male Fighter] You can do
this.

571
00:48:00.125 --> 00:48:01.333
- No.

572
00:48:01.333 --> 00:48:02.583
It's over.

573
00:48:02.583 --> 00:48:03.750
I'm over.

574
00:48:04.708 --> 00:48:05.917
- HellKat won her fight.

575
00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:08.917
If she can. you can win.

576
00:48:08.917 --> 00:48:10.417
We can win.

577
00:48:10.417 --> 00:48:12.042
- This little shit won?

578
00:48:12.042 --> 00:48:13.042
How?

579
00:48:13.042 --> 00:48:17.000
- All you think you know means
nothing.

580
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.833
Ignore your mind. embrace your
spirit.

581
00:48:20.833 --> 00:48:22.000
- Oh. yeah. Uh-huh.

582
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.750
Everything that really
matters is right here.

583
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:27.042
- That's your heart!

584
00:48:27.042 --> 00:48:28.958
I said your spirit!

585
00:48:28.958 --> 00:48:30.833
- What difference does it make?

586
00:48:30.833 --> 00:48:32.875
I'm fucked either way.

587
00:48:32.875 --> 00:48:35.333
Why the fuck do you think
I'm here to start with?

588
00:48:36.875 --> 00:48:38.500
What did you do to get put here?

589
00:48:41.083 --> 00:48:42.333
Do you know why I'm here?

590
00:48:43.917 --> 00:48:45.417
- I don't need to know.

591
00:48:45.417 --> 00:48:47.875
- You don't want to know.
Believe me.

592
00:48:49.458 --> 00:48:51.083
- I am not fit to judge.

593
00:48:55.042 --> 00:48:56.542
- And the only way I can save
myself

594
00:48:56.542 --> 00:48:58.833
is by fighting a fucking
monster?

595
00:48:58.833 --> 00:49:00.667
- Everyone has their own path.

596
00:49:00.667 --> 00:49:02.750
- Oh. spare the Buddha
bullshit. I'm fucked.

597
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:04.167
- So we've heard!
- Fuck you!

598
00:49:04.167 --> 00:49:05.375
- Calm down. Salt.

599
00:49:05.375 --> 00:49:06.667
- You calm down!

600
00:49:06.667 --> 00:49:08.333
Shit!
(suspenseful music)

601
00:49:08.333 --> 00:49:10.208
What are they gonna put in front
of me?

602
00:49:11.125 --> 00:49:13.292
What if it's something
I'm really scared of?

603
00:49:13.292 --> 00:49:14.792
They know everything about us.

604
00:49:14.792 --> 00:49:16.792
Our. our pasts. our nightmares.

605
00:49:16.792 --> 00:49:18.583
- Okay look. just stop it. okay?

606
00:49:18.583 --> 00:49:20.083
- Fuck off!

607
00:49:20.083 --> 00:49:21.500
Oh. my god.

608
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.667
- [Doctor] Not here.

609
00:49:24.333 --> 00:49:25.667
- Why?

610
00:49:25.667 --> 00:49:26.667
Why?

611
00:49:26.667 --> 00:49:29.208
- We all know why we're here.

612
00:49:29.208 --> 00:49:31.083
We've earned it!

613
00:49:31.083 --> 00:49:35.167
Now face it and do what you do
need to do.

614
00:49:35.167 --> 00:49:39.125
This is truly your last chance.

615
00:49:39.125 --> 00:49:40.208
- Fuck!

616
00:49:40.208 --> 00:49:41.042
Jesus.

617
00:49:42.125 --> 00:49:45.542
- Did somebody say "fuck Jesus?"

618
00:49:45.542 --> 00:49:47.000
(chuckles)

619
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.458
Can I get an Amen?

620
00:49:49.458 --> 00:49:52.792
(indistinct whispering)

621
00:49:55.417 --> 00:49:56.333
Can you hear that?

622
00:49:58.958 --> 00:50:00.083
- What are they saying?

623
00:50:02.375 --> 00:50:03.750
- "Kill the bitch."

624
00:50:05.125 --> 00:50:05.958
Let's go.

625
00:50:07.208 --> 00:50:09.042
- I didn't know what I was
doing.

626
00:50:09.042 --> 00:50:11.500
It wasn't my fault. I was sick.

627
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.708
What do they call it?

628
00:50:12.708 --> 00:50:14.125
Not guilty due to insanity.

629
00:50:15.583 --> 00:50:16.625
I don't deserve this.

630
00:50:19.292 --> 00:50:20.292
- Yes. you do.

631
00:50:21.917 --> 00:50:24.417
(alarm wails)

632
00:50:33.875 --> 00:50:36.875
(suspenseful music)

633
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.250
(fighter growls)

634
00:50:56.833 --> 00:50:57.667
- Oh. no.

635
00:51:02.208 --> 00:51:04.958
- You get your fuckin' ass in
there.

636
00:51:04.958 --> 00:51:07.167
or I'll send you straight to
hell.

637
00:51:08.792 --> 00:51:09.583
Get up.

638
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:25.000
(chuckles)

639
00:51:32.667 --> 00:51:35.125
- (sniffles) I'm sorry.

640
00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:37.125
I'm sorry for what I did.

641
00:51:37.125 --> 00:51:38.875
- Oh. okay.

642
00:51:38.875 --> 00:51:41.458
(laughs)

643
00:51:41.458 --> 00:51:45.375
All is forgiven then. (laughs)

644
00:52:09.833 --> 00:52:12.583
(fighter snarls)

645
00:52:21.958 --> 00:52:24.708
(fighter snarls)

646
00:52:32.958 --> 00:52:37.958
(sharp thud)
(fighter screams)

647
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.750
(fighter groans)

648
00:52:53.167 --> 00:52:54.333
- Yes!

649
00:52:54.333 --> 00:52:55.250
Fuck yes!

650
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:58.042
Now let me go. I want my reward.
you fuck.

651
00:52:59.792 --> 00:53:01.667
- Here she is.
(woman chuckles)

652
00:53:01.667 --> 00:53:02.833
Don't you look divine?

653
00:53:02.833 --> 00:53:05.292
- Mm. Jimmy. (chuckles)

654
00:53:05.292 --> 00:53:06.417
- Are you singing?

655
00:53:08.083 --> 00:53:10.500
- Not yet. (giggles)

656
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.250
(fighter growls)

657
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.333
- What the fuck?

658
00:53:26.292 --> 00:53:28.875
(woman laughs)

659
00:53:34.708 --> 00:53:38.792
(thuds)
(bones crack)

660
00:53:38.792 --> 00:53:42.125
(dissonant tones)

661
00:53:42.125 --> 00:53:44.833
(fighter howls)

662
00:53:44.833 --> 00:53:48.292
(Jimmy and woman laugh)

663
00:53:48.292 --> 00:53:49.208
- Oh. fuck.

664
00:53:53.125 --> 00:53:56.125
(grunts)
(thuds)

665
00:53:56.125 --> 00:53:58.000
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose.
man.

666
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.333
(grunts)
(thud)

667
00:54:00.333 --> 00:54:01.167
Ain't no way.

668
00:54:01.167 --> 00:54:03.875
(grunts)
(thuds)

669
00:54:03.875 --> 00:54:08.208
(alarm wails)
(suspenseful music)

670
00:54:08.208 --> 00:54:09.208
- Fuck this.

671
00:54:10.167 --> 00:54:15.292
- There is eternity. there is
oblivion and there is hope.

672
00:54:15.292 --> 00:54:20.208
Where you end up. believe it
or not. is entirely up to you.

673
00:54:28.083 --> 00:54:30.417
- Let's get ready to rumble!

674
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:33.167
(thud)

675
00:54:36.875 --> 00:54:39.667
- Whatever you are. I don't
care.

676
00:54:48.083 --> 00:54:51.458
- You're really beginning
to piss me off. sister.

677
00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:56.125
You're up. big boy.

678
00:55:04.458 --> 00:55:07.875
(moody electronic music)

679
00:55:24.792 --> 00:55:27.458
(fighter sighs)

680
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.958
- Listen. before you go in.

681
00:55:41.958 --> 00:55:45.375
is there any way you could
lay down on this one?

682
00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:47.542
Because if you lose. we could do
a whole

683
00:55:47.542 --> 00:55:50.625
cat versus dog thing in the next
round.

684
00:55:50.625 --> 00:55:51.958
That's clever. right?

685
00:55:51.958 --> 00:55:56.958
(woman meows)
(Jimmy barks)

686
00:56:01.167 --> 00:56:04.208
(barks)
- Jimmy.

687
00:56:04.208 --> 00:56:06.750
(both laugh)

688

692
00:56:33.958 --> 00:56:35.833
(Jimmy and woman laugh)

693
00:56:35.833 --> 00:56:37.500
- Come on. big boy.

694
00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.750
- Hit him!

695
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:43.375
Hit him! (cackles)

696
00:56:46.625 --> 00:56:48.542

(thud)
(bone cracks)

703
00:57:15.958 --> 00:57:17.542
(woman yelps)

704
00:57:17.542 --> 00:57:20.208
- (sobs) Jimmy!

705
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.583
(Jimmy laughs)

706
00:57:28.292 --> 00:57:29.125
Jimmy!

707

(woman laughs)

713
00:58:07.667 --> 00:58:10.333
(fighter pants)

714
00:58:18.583 --> 00:58:21.250
(fighter pants)

715
00:58:33.792 --> 00:58:38.875
- [Fighter] Oh. fuck. (pants)

716
00:58:38.875 --> 00:58:40.708
- He'll be fine.

717
00:58:40.708 --> 00:58:42.125
Get ready for the...

718
00:58:42.125 --> 00:58:45.875
(alarm wails)
(ominous music)

719
00:58:45.875 --> 00:58:48.375
(Jimmy claps)

720
00:58:49.833 --> 00:58:52.125
- (chuckles) Congratulations.
big boy.

721
00:58:52.125 --> 00:58:55.958
You beat the tomato can.

(fighter groans)

725
00:59:18.292 --> 00:59:20.000
Oh. do you like my boots?

726
00:59:21.125 --> 00:59:22.458
I'm flattered you noticed.

727
00:59:24.042 --> 00:59:25.667
They're very rare.

728
00:59:25.667 --> 00:59:28.750
Made of 100% human skin.

729
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:31.375
Just the uppers. of course.

730
00:59:31.375 --> 00:59:33.417
They'd make a great present for
somebody.

731
00:59:34.417 --> 00:59:38.458
Unless you'd like a pair

735
01:00:14.667 --> 01:00:16.667

746
01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:31.750

747
01:01:37.208 --> 01:01:40.042
(Katrina screams)

748
01:01:42.125 --> 01:01:44.958
(flesh squelches)

749
01:01:47.167 --> 01:01:50.000
(Katrina screams)

750
01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:53.917
(flesh squelches)

751
01:01:53.917 --> 01:01:56.708
(Katrina screams)

752
01:02:08.917 --> 01:02:10.917
- Holy Moses.
(ominous music)

753
01:02:10.917 --> 01:02:12.292
(chuckles)

754
01:02:12.292 --> 01:02:13.542
I gotta tell ya.

755
01:02:13.542 --> 01:02:16.042
I can't wait for this next
fight.

756
01:02:16.042 --> 01:02:19.000
The crowd is so quiet with
anticipation down there.

757
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.042
you could hear a rat piss in
Hong Kong.

758
01:02:22.042 --> 01:02:23.375
(chuckles)

759
01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:24.333
Are you ready?

760
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:26.875
- No.

761
01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:27.958
- Well. get ready.

762
01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:31.167
One night only.

763
01:02:31.167 --> 01:02:33.250
Last man standing.

764
01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:35.417
John Hancock on the jotted line.

765
01:02:35.417 --> 01:02:36.917
- Son of a bitch.

766
01:02:36.917 --> 01:02:38.375
- Indeed.

767
01:02:38.375 --> 01:02:40.500
She was a bitch.

768
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:44.125
Her specialty was drinking
and then she'd hit me

769
01:02:44.125 --> 01:02:46.333
with whatever she could get her
hands on.

770
01:02:47.417 --> 01:02:50.042
Took till the time came
for me to hit her back.

771
01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:53.500
And there began the yellow brick
road.

772
01:02:54.625 --> 01:02:55.542
And look at me now.

773
01:02:57.250 --> 01:02:58.458
I'm the wizard.

774
01:02:58.458 --> 01:03:01.375
(chuckles)
(alarm wails)

775
01:03:01.375 --> 01:03:02.708
Here we go. big boy.

776
01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:05.542
Gotta tell ya.

777
01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:08.292
I don't fancy your chances.

778
01:03:09.167 --> 01:03:11.417
(chuckles)

779
01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:19.000
- No one saves us. but
ourselves.

780
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.500
- What about God?
- God?

781
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.708
God grants you free will!

782
01:03:23.708 --> 01:03:27.333
Your own mind. your own spirit.
yourself.

783
01:03:27.333 --> 01:03:30.792
Your being alone has the
power to enlighten you.

784
01:03:30.792 --> 01:03:34.250
Just as it may destroy you.

785
01:03:40.167 --> 01:03:43.208
(dark electronic music)

786
01:03:43.208 --> 01:03:44.042
- What?

787
01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:46.833
What's that?

788
01:03:46.833 --> 01:03:48.708
- Liquid God.

789
01:03:48.708 --> 01:03:49.542
Come here!

790
01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:54.042
Turn around!

791
01:03:54.042 --> 01:03:54.875
Trust me.

792
01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:57.708
This will help.

793
01:03:57.708 --> 01:04:00.458
(fighter groans)

794
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:04.667
- Damn.

795
01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:06.667
That feels good.

796
01:04:06.667 --> 01:04:11.583
- No matter what awaits you
below. believe you can prevail.

797
01:04:23.875 --> 01:04:24.708
- Damn.

798
01:04:27.375 --> 01:04:28.667
- Show time.

799
01:04:28.667 --> 01:04:30.917
(chuckles)

800
01:04:32.875 --> 01:04:36.125

(fighter pants)
(dark music)

814
01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:03.917
- Come!

815
01:06:03.917 --> 01:06:05.458
Let me work on you!

816
01:06:05.458 --> 01:06:06.292
- No.

817
01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.875
- Come!
- I said. no!

818
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:13.000
- Then you will face the
repercussions.

819
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.583
- I'm done with this shit. man.

820
01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:18.458
- You know why this is?

821
01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:19.292
- Yes.

822
01:06:21.417 --> 01:06:25.542
- You must atone to redeem
for what you have done.

823
01:06:25.542 --> 01:06:26.917
- I know. shit!

824
01:06:31.292 --> 01:06:33.542
- Sounds like someone needs a
reminder.

825
01:06:34.667 --> 01:06:35.500
- Damn you.

826
01:06:38.708 --> 01:06:41.375
- What about you. Katrina?

827
01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:42.417
What did you do?

828
01:06:46.375 --> 01:06:47.917
Cat got your tongue?

829
01:06:49.458 --> 01:06:50.250
- Shut up.

830
01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:53.417
- Mom of the year?

831
01:06:53.417 --> 01:06:54.500
- Shut your mouth!

832
01:06:55.833 --> 01:06:57.208
- What happened?

833
01:06:57.208 --> 01:06:59.083
- Yeah. Katrina.

834
01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:00.333
What happened?

835
01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:01.167
- You know.

836
01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:04.583
- Is that it?

837
01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:07.958
Can we not have a bit more
color?

838
01:07:07.958 --> 01:07:12.250
Like. "don't leave mommy's
opiates lying around."

839
01:07:14.167 --> 01:07:17.375
But it goes with the
territory. doesn't it. HellKat?

840
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.583
Blah. blah. blah. All this talk.

841
01:07:22.583 --> 01:07:24.833
We've gotta get on with the
grand finale.

842
01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:27.708
You're up. HellKat.

843
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:33.333
And you too. big poppa pump.

844
01:07:35.667 --> 01:07:37.917
(chuckles)

845
01:07:43.208 --> 01:07:44.042
- I won't do it.

846
01:07:45.667 --> 01:07:46.500
- Me neither.

847
01:07:48.417 --> 01:07:49.833
- Oh. yes. you will.

848
01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:54.667
You'll do anything to save your
boy.

849
01:07:58.875 --> 01:07:59.958
And you?

850
01:07:59.958 --> 01:08:02.917
Your wife and your brother.

851
01:08:02.917 --> 01:08:04.750
(chuckles)

852
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:06.750
Your wife and your brother.

853
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:11.167
That's some real trailer
park shit. (chuckles)

854
01:08:12.042 --> 01:08:12.875
Oh!

855
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:18.792
"I'd do anything to
atone for my mistakes."

856
01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:21.875
(chuckles)

857
01:08:21.875 --> 01:08:22.708
Oh. yeah.

858
01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:25.792
You'll do it.

859
01:08:27.042 --> 01:08:29.708
I think you'll do just about
anything.

860
01:08:36.875 --> 01:08:38.458
Oh. no!
(chainsaw buzzes)

861
01:08:38.458 --> 01:08:41.000
A chainsaw! (laughs)

862
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And here's me. sittin' on a
tree!

863
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.917
- You will be punished for your
anger!

864
01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:51.792
You will be punished by your
anger!

865
01:08:51.792 --> 01:08:55.542
- Come on. then! (laughs)

866
01:08:55.542 --> 01:08:58.083
(chainsaw buzzes)

867
01:08:58.083 --> 01:09:00.250

(lighter flicks)

879
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.333
- God damn it.

880
01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:07.917
Are you gettin' it now?

881
01:10:07.917 --> 01:10:09.625
This is my world!

882
01:10:11.292 --> 01:10:12.583
Time to fight.

883
01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:15.083
(alarm wails)

884
01:10:21.208 --> 01:10:24.208
(suspenseful music)

885
01:10:26.042 --> 01:10:30.042
- They're like two scorpions
in a bottle. (chuckles)

886
01:10:35.833 --> 01:10:37.375
Jimmy. why ain't they fighting?

887
01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:40.708
I think they need a bit of...

888
01:10:42.292 --> 01:10:43.125
Prodding.

889
01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.292
- Yes. I think they do too.

895
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:25.833
Matteo?

What're you waiting for?

912
01:14:19.917 --> 01:14:22.750
Kill him. Katrina.

This is it.

917
01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:32.583
Think of your son.

918
01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:37.000
(chuckles)

919
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.417
I'll give you another chance.

920
01:14:40.625 --> 01:14:42.458
I'll make you a champion.

921
01:14:42.458 --> 01:14:45.042
Everybody will know who you are.

922
01:14:46.125 --> 01:14:47.542
You'll be a legend.

923
01:14:47.542 --> 01:14:52.000
Everybody will know the name of
HellKat.

924
01:14:53.958 --> 01:14:56.375
(bat clunks)

925
01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:07.125
What're you doin'?

926
01:15:08.625 --> 01:15:09.458
Get up.

927
01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:16.542
Stand up and fight for your
soul!

928
01:15:18.583 --> 01:15:19.417
- No.

929
01:15:21.042 --> 01:15:24.167
- Fight me!

930
01:15:24.167 --> 01:15:25.750
- No more fighting.

931
01:15:27.625 --> 01:15:30.125
- Fight for your pathetic son!

932
01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:34.917
Then die!

933
01:15:43.667 --> 01:15:47.167
