One of

184
00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:36.489
does it turn off now.

When I had
John Joseph. my child.

257
00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.311
he was six months old

258
00:16:14.346 --> 00:16:17.776
and we were sleeping
in that bed by ourselves.

259
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.481
This is
the weirdest thing.

260

to get him some milk.

262
00:16:23.652 --> 00:16:26.323
And when I got to the kitchen
to get him some milk.

263
00:16:26.358 --> 00:16:29.656
I heard this ballroom music
in this living room.

264
00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:32.164
And it was like.
very loud

265
00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:34.364
and it was
just playin' and playin'.

266
00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:36.795
And my mother-in-law
had come here

267
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.269
and she was upstairs.

268
00:16:38.304 --> 00:16:40.106
And I thought.
"When she wakes up.

269
00:16:40.141 --> 00:16:43.208
I'm goin' fuss at her
for having that ringtone

270
00:16:43.243 --> 00:16:45.606
that plays
all night long."

271
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.148
But the whole time
I was down here getting milk.

272
00:16:49.183 --> 00:16:51.150
there was ballroom music.

273
00:16:51.185 --> 00:16:52.415
When I got up
in the morning.

274
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.780

278
00:17:00.392 --> 00:17:03.162
I wish somebody
could find an answer

279
00:17:03.197 --> 00:17:07.364

what that answer might be.

280
00:17:07.399 --> 00:17:08.464
You know?

281
00:17:09.764 --> 00:17:11.467
Ashley's passing.

282
00:17:11.898 --> 00:17:14.437
We lost her quickly.

283
00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:17.275
And Alice
is so unique.

284
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.706
She processes some things

285
00:17:19.741 --> 00:17:21.609
differently than
anybody that I know.

286
00:17:22.183 --> 00:17:25.250
I'm actually fine
because I think

287
00:17:25.285 --> 00:17:27.252
I've processed
all that ahead of time.

288
00:17:27.287 --> 00:17:29.452
But I still think
that life continues.

289
00:17:29.487 --> 00:17:31.850
And I really--
when I visualize her.

290
00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:36.195
my natural sense
is that. um.

291
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.659
she's perfectly fine.
she's perfectly happy.

292
00:17:41.202 --> 00:17:42.894
One of the reasons
why we decided

293
00:17:42.929 --> 00:17:46.865
to start
calling out Ashley's name

294
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.736
is because she knows
what we do here

295
00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:51.210
as far as investigating.

296
00:17:51.245 --> 00:17:54.411
Ashley did grow up here.
She loved Alice.

297
00:17:54.776 --> 00:17:57.414
And. I mean. it makes sense.
She knows what we did.

298
00:17:57.449 --> 00:17:59.218
-She liked what we did.
-And of course.

299
00:17:59.253 --> 00:18:01.748
we did this
with Alice's consent.

300
00:18:01.783 --> 00:18:02.881
which is very important.

301
00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.850
And the night
we did that.

302
00:18:04.885 --> 00:18:08.524
we did get some strange.
direct responses

303
00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:10.559
from the organ
over in the corner.

304
00:18:10.594 --> 00:18:12.264
We were respectful. obviously.

305
00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:14.563
And we said.
"Ashley. are you here?"

306
00:18:14.598 --> 00:18:16.301
You know.
"Can you give us a sign?"

307
00:18:16.336 --> 00:18:18.270
You know. "We would love
to communicate with you.

308
00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:20.536
talk to you. let you know
Alice misses you."

309
00:18:21.275 --> 00:18:23.803
And all of a sudden.

310
00:18:23.838 --> 00:18:26.641
the organ piano
started booming

311
00:18:26.676 --> 00:18:28.379

It wasn't a keystroke.

322
00:19:02.712 --> 00:19:05.383
It was a thumping sound
coming from the organ.

Thank you.
Keep doing that for us.

324
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.465
That's a direct response.
Thank you.

325
00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:30.837
Turn it off. Or like--

326
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.611

327
00:19:35.646 --> 00:19:38.482
Yeah.
Yeah. There's only...

328
00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:43.487
I'm just curious
because whenever

329
00:19:43.522 --> 00:19:45.522
we all go back there.
it stops.

330
00:19:46.558 --> 00:19:48.789
It's off.
My phone's down. Off.

331
00:19:50.364 --> 00:19:52.364
-Lights off--
-Chandelier shut off.

332
00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:54.564
Later on we found out.
or I found out.

333
00:19:54.599 --> 00:19:57.963
that Ashley
is who gave Alice

334
00:19:57.998 --> 00:20:00.438
that piano. organ.

335
00:20:00.473 --> 00:20:02.407
We got
an organ in the house.

336
00:20:02.442 --> 00:20:04.002
And. uh.
we had heard. you know.

337
00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:05.674
my daughter
gave it to me

338
00:20:05.709 --> 00:20:08.006
because she had heard of
a lady in town was selling it

339
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:09.744
because
she said it was haunted.

340
00:20:09.779 --> 00:20:11.812
And she was trying to
sell it for $150.

341
00:20:11.847 --> 00:20:13.352
Well.
nobody bought it.

342
00:20:13.387 --> 00:20:15.783
And so then she said
she'd sell it for $75.

343
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:17.983
I told Ashley
I would take it. you know.

344
00:20:18.018 --> 00:20:19.457
And so. uh.
I went up there

345
00:20:19.492 --> 00:20:21.492
and got it
and it didn't do anything.

346
00:20:21.527 --> 00:20:24.858
But when John and Brad tried
to get the organ to play.

347
00:20:24.893 --> 00:20:27.630
they called her name
and that's when it played.

348
00:20:30.437 --> 00:20:31.700
There was two right there.

349
00:20:31.735 --> 00:20:34.703
It did. "Dum-dum."
You-- 'Cause you went...

350
00:20:36.344 --> 00:20:38.311
Do I think it's Ashley?

351
00:20:38.709 --> 00:20:39.742
Again. it's speculation.

352
00:20:39.777 --> 00:20:41.974
But I think it's possible
because of the amount

353
00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:43.646
of direct responses
that I got.

354
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:45.978
It's not crazy to think
that this would be a place

355
00:20:46.013 --> 00:20:47.650
if Ashley was
to come and visit.

356
00:20:47.685 --> 00:20:50.081
Now. I'm not saying
that I necessarily

357
00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:51.720
think that was her.

358
00:20:51.755 --> 00:20:53.821
But I know that
she would do that if she could.

359
00:20:55.858 --> 00:21:00.894
♪

360
00:21:14.074 --> 00:21:16.778
Obviously. we know that
the land is probably

361
00:21:16.813 --> 00:21:19.484
the heartbeat
of the supernatural things

362
00:21:19.519 --> 00:21:20.782
that are happening here.

363
00:21:21.389 --> 00:21:22.685
Say hello. John Bullard.

364
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.752
What's happenin'?

365
00:21:23.787 --> 00:21:25.490
John Bullard's in the house.

366
00:21:25.525 --> 00:21:26.821
Sabrina. all you need
is a beach and this.

367
00:21:27.692 --> 00:21:28.856
Amy Bullard's in the house.

368
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.530
Seeing the research tent
pop up is cool

369
00:21:32.565 --> 00:21:34.466
because it's nice
to have a base camp.

370
00:21:36.404 --> 00:21:37.667
It makes it
easier for us

371
00:21:37.702 --> 00:21:39.438
to help document things
in the house.

372
00:21:39.473 --> 00:21:42.540
So to see this tent.
that's things we dream

373
00:21:42.575 --> 00:21:44.135
of being able
to have access to

374
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.576
as paranormal investigators.

375
00:21:45.611 --> 00:21:46.874
-In here.
-This is awesome.

376
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:48.348
This is awesome.

377
00:21:49.483 --> 00:21:50.977
One of
the most exciting things

378
00:21:51.012 --> 00:21:52.649
is the
ground-penetrating radar.

379
00:21:52.684 --> 00:21:54.387
Alice has been wanting
to do that for forever.

380
00:21:54.422 --> 00:21:56.719
I'm Benton Smith
with Century Mapping.

381
00:21:56.754 --> 00:21:59.722
We combine ground-penetrating
radar with GPS.

382
00:22:00.527 --> 00:22:02.725
We map
underground infrastructure

383
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.860
from cemeteries
to municipalities.

384
00:22:05.895 --> 00:22:07.433
anything that's underground.

385
00:22:07.468 --> 00:22:08.698
If there was
a burial. like.

386
00:22:08.733 --> 00:22:10.766
let's say a body
was buried in a shroud.

387
00:22:11.197 --> 00:22:14.473
Um. body decomposes
really quickly...

388
00:22:15.509 --> 00:22:18.543
leaving basically
a pocket of air.

389
00:22:21.647 --> 00:22:23.647
Yeah. so. All right.
So you see this?

390
00:22:24.012 --> 00:22:26.914
This could be just
a change in the type of soil.

391
00:22:26.949 --> 00:22:28.520
I mean.
it could be from--

392
00:22:29.116 --> 00:22:30.885
obviously we have
a lot of clay here.

393
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.953
But in your estimation.
it would probably

394
00:22:32.988 --> 00:22:35.153
just be soil related

395
00:22:35.188 --> 00:22:37.023
and not like
a man-made structure

396
00:22:37.058 --> 00:22:38.629
or burial.
that sort of thing?

397
00:22:38.664 --> 00:22:40.191
-Not a burial.
-Okay.

398
00:22:40.226 --> 00:22:42.028
Not a burial.
but I mean. could it be

399
00:22:42.063 --> 00:22:43.502
something that
was man-made. yeah.

400
00:23:05.922 --> 00:23:10.958
♪

401
00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.971
So these are--

402
00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:26.974
These are potential burials.

403
00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.482
It's not
a lot to see.

404
00:23:29.517 --> 00:23:31.176
But you can see here

405
00:23:31.211 --> 00:23:33.112
there's a beginning
and an end.

406
00:23:33.147 --> 00:23:34.817
-Yes.
-This is about

407
00:23:34.852 --> 00:23:36.016
four to five feet.

408
00:23:36.557 --> 00:23:39.921
And so everywhere
that I have a red flag.

409
00:23:39.956 --> 00:23:41.054
it's very similar.

410
00:23:41.089 --> 00:23:42.594
There's something there.

411
00:23:43.597 --> 00:23:45.729
Is that typically
what you would see

412
00:23:45.764 --> 00:23:47.632
if you were doing
that sort of work--

413
00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:49.832
Yeah. in a--
For an unmarked grave? Yeah.

414
00:23:49.867 --> 00:23:52.505
-Okay.
-There's certainly...

415
00:23:54.003 --> 00:23:55.871
I mean.
so far I've found

416
00:23:55.906 --> 00:23:58.071
10 areas that...

417
00:24:00.174 --> 00:24:03.241
some of them
could be unmarked graves.

418
00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:04.715
-Wow.
-Yeah.

419
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.112
-Oh. my gosh.
-Could be.

420
00:24:06.147 --> 00:24:07.718
Ten. huh? Whoo.

421
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.861
-Alice? Hey.
-Hey.

422
00:24:19.897 --> 00:24:21.963
Alice. this is Carolyn.
Uh. Carolyn. Uh. Alice.

423
00:24:21.998 --> 00:24:23.998
-How are you?
-Nice to meet you.

424
00:24:24.033 --> 00:24:27.606
So I brought in a geophysicist
named Carolyn

425
00:24:27.641 --> 00:24:30.070
with background
in astrophysics to really

426
00:24:30.105 --> 00:24:33.843
look into what could be
creating that light phenomena.

427
00:24:33.878 --> 00:24:36.274
Because a lot of things
can be explained

428
00:24:36.309 --> 00:24:38.848
by what's happening
environmentally

429
00:24:38.883 --> 00:24:41.048
and not something paranormal.

430
00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:44.315
I'm delighted to have
somebody to tell that story to

431
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.119
who would
understand possibly.

432
00:24:46.154 --> 00:24:48.253
My name
is Carolyn Streiff

433
00:24:48.288 --> 00:24:51.091
and I am
a geophysicist

434
00:24:51.126 --> 00:24:53.698
that specializes
in near-surface

435
00:24:53.733 --> 00:24:56.767
geophysics acquisition
and analysis.

436
00:24:58.705 --> 00:25:01.299
The ERI
is a very useful tool

437
00:25:01.334 --> 00:25:03.939
because
we already have known

438
00:25:03.974 --> 00:25:05.611
value ranges

439
00:25:05.646 --> 00:25:08.614
for different
sediment and rock units.

440
00:25:08.649 --> 00:25:11.815
I could give some
information now for Alice

441
00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.983
to hopefully be able
to start coming to some sort of

442
00:25:15.018 --> 00:25:17.656
resolution
of what is happening here.

443
00:25:18.054 --> 00:25:19.790
She gave us
a lot of theories

444
00:25:19.825 --> 00:25:22.122
as to what
could be creating the phenomena

445
00:25:22.157 --> 00:25:23.255
Alice is experiencing.

446
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.224
It has to do
with earthquakes

447
00:25:25.259 --> 00:25:27.292
and maybe even volcanoes

448
00:25:27.327 --> 00:25:29.602
and fault lines
and blue shale

449
00:25:29.637 --> 00:25:31.934
that's underneath
the ground here.

450
00:25:31.969 --> 00:25:34.673
There are
different types of rocks

451
00:25:34.708 --> 00:25:36.807
that when
you heat them or cool them.

452
00:25:36.842 --> 00:25:38.677
they will
have a voltage.

453
00:25:38.712 --> 00:25:41.746
If you compress them.
if you get a charge on to them.

454
00:25:41.781 --> 00:25:45.178
Also. when you do different
mechanical processes.

455
00:25:45.213 --> 00:25:46.850
they will illuminate.

456
00:25:47.215 --> 00:25:48.687
There is

457
00:25:48.722 --> 00:25:51.382
an actual
scientific effect

458
00:25:51.417 --> 00:25:54.352
that creates light
from rubbing quartz.

459
00:25:54.387 --> 00:25:55.991
And because we know

460
00:25:56.026 --> 00:25:58.862
that Alice has sand
and shale underneath her home.

461
00:25:58.897 --> 00:26:01.062
there is quartz
in sand and shale.

462
00:26:01.394 --> 00:26:03.933
So. could
something be causing

463
00:26:03.968 --> 00:26:07.607
some of these light effects
that Alice is seeing?

464
00:26:08.038 --> 00:26:11.105
What if something
is affecting Alice's house

465
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.339
momentarily because of
charges in the ground

466
00:26:14.374 --> 00:26:15.879
that could be occurring?

467
00:26:17.982 --> 00:26:20.345
Having a geophysicist
come do research here

468
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.017
on the land is--
is huge.

469
00:26:22.756 --> 00:26:24.283
I think it's very
exciting anytime you have

470

a person of science background
that's willing to reach out

471
00:26:28.454 --> 00:26:30.388
to the paranormal
side of things.

472
00:26:30.423 --> 00:26:31.895
You don't see that.

At least I haven't.

474

that passed by the tree
that the dog hit at.

480

So. there's something else
in the ground there.

481

That is not soil.
that is something.

a tree root.

483

It's too big
to be a tree root.

basically is the electricity

485

-I'll tell you something.

492
00:27:16.304 --> 00:27:19.943
This is
extremely similar

493
00:27:19.978 --> 00:27:23.947
to when I did
an old section of a cemetery

494
00:27:23.982 --> 00:27:26.477
and the body
was no longer decomposing

495
00:27:26.512 --> 00:27:28.446
so there was no longer
any signature of the body.

496
00:27:28.481 --> 00:27:31.889
But the fill
that was above the body

497
00:27:31.924 --> 00:27:34.760
was still
resistive enough to be shown.

498
00:27:34.795 --> 00:27:36.762
which is what
we're exactly seeing here.

499
00:27:36.797 --> 00:27:39.765
And there's
now fresh soil on top.

500
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.833
So. that's
a loose sort of fill.

501
00:27:41.868 --> 00:27:44.737
as if somebody
had a shovel or something.

502

00:29:30.438 --> 00:29:32.273
And there
is nobody over here.

532
00:29:32.308 --> 00:29:35.573
There's nobody here.
nobody turned around.

533
00:29:35.608 --> 00:29:37.245
-Okay.
-So. you were--

534
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.984
I'm just having a--
This is just too wild.

535
00:29:40.019 --> 00:29:41.282
Sorry. Yes. Okay.

536
00:29:41.317 --> 00:29:44.120
So. during your. just research

537
00:29:44.155 --> 00:29:46.221
on your lines.

538
00:29:46.256 --> 00:29:49.191
you thought you saw
somebody walking over here?

539
00:29:49.226 --> 00:29:50.995
And you came over
and there's nobody here?

540
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:53.294
And I just
happened to see

541
00:29:53.329 --> 00:29:55.329
as I'm facing towards

542
00:29:55.364 --> 00:29:57.936
this area of the yard.

543
00:29:57.971 --> 00:30:00.301
I saw somebody walking.

544
00:30:00.336 --> 00:30:03.634
uh. toward-- I saw somebody
walking towards the tent.

545
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:06.637
I mean. I don't want to
put any more sort of--

546
00:30:06.672 --> 00:30:09.541
not fear.
but I guess maybe anxiety

547
00:30:09.576 --> 00:30:12.016
into the situation
for you.

548
00:30:12.051 --> 00:30:14.887
But there are many.
many reports

549
00:30:14.922 --> 00:30:18.484
of an apparition
being seen back here.

550
00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:20.090
Uh.
the neighbor has claimed

551
00:30:20.125 --> 00:30:21.861
to see
an apparition back here.

552
00:30:22.292 --> 00:30:25.227
We did have a psychic named.
uh. Jill come here

553
00:30:25.262 --> 00:30:29.099
and she drew
the image of a gentleman

554
00:30:29.134 --> 00:30:32.003
that she saw
in the backyard here.

555
00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:36.238
Uh. so.
the gentleman I saw.

556
00:30:36.273 --> 00:30:38.504
without like-- I--
the thing that drew me

557
00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:41.342
to seeing this person walking
for just a brief second

558
00:30:41.377 --> 00:30:44.642
was the fact that
he was wearing white.

559
00:30:44.677 --> 00:30:46.248
-But--
-Carolyn came here

560
00:30:46.283 --> 00:30:48.954
as a total nonbeliever
of the paranormal

561
00:30:48.989 --> 00:30:51.990
and had an experience
that changed her mind.

562
00:30:52.025 --> 00:30:54.124
And she's honestly
a little bit concerned

563
00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:55.961
that the science community

564
00:30:55.996 --> 00:30:58.128
is going to
look down on her.

565
00:30:58.163 --> 00:30:59.690
They're going to
raise their eyebrow.

566
00:30:59.725 --> 00:31:01.395
But. you know.
that's scary for me

567
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:04.937
because I wanted to
completely explain

568
00:31:04.972 --> 00:31:07.203
a lot of the phenomena
so I could tell Alice. like.

569
00:31:07.238 --> 00:31:09.700
what you're experiencing
is actually A. B. C and D.

570
00:31:09.735 --> 00:31:12.670
But the geophysicist
had an experience.

571
00:31:12.705 --> 00:31:16.080
Uh. we've had
another person. Erin.

572
00:31:16.115 --> 00:31:19.215
who lived next door.
grew up next door.

573
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.349
who said she saw
a full body apparition

574
00:31:21.384 --> 00:31:24.022
not only in the same location
as the geophysicist

575
00:31:24.057 --> 00:31:28.026
but also the description
was pretty close.

576
00:31:28.061 --> 00:31:30.259
A male
in a white shirt.

577
00:31:30.294 --> 00:31:35.099
♪

578
00:31:35.134 --> 00:31:37.101
The man
I saw at the door.

579
00:31:37.136 --> 00:31:39.070
he seemed
to be about my height.

580
00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:42.337
Very young.
Early twenties. Late teens.

581
00:31:42.768 --> 00:31:45.274
He was wearing a white shirt
and he had dark hair

582
00:31:45.309 --> 00:31:48.013
and it was slicked back
and real strong eyes.

583
00:31:49.148 --> 00:31:53.018
I didn't feel like a presence
or anything when I was here.

584
00:31:53.053 --> 00:31:56.219
cutting grass. it was
completely sprung up on me.

585
00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.718
And he looked
so real.

586
00:32:00.753 --> 00:32:02.390
He was looking
this direction.

587
00:32:02.425 --> 00:32:05.096
And I came around the corner
and he turned his head

588
00:32:05.131 --> 00:32:07.494
and looked right at me.
and I looked at him.

589
00:32:08.101 --> 00:32:11.630
And his--
his eyes were so intense.

590
00:32:11.665 --> 00:32:14.534
It wasn't anything li--
the ghostly.

591
00:32:14.569 --> 00:32:18.505
fuzzy. foggy look that you
think you see in movies and TV.

592
00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.113
He was completely solid.

593
00:32:24.084 --> 00:32:25.545
Erin told us
the story about

594
00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.152
seeing the full body apparition
on the back land.

595
00:32:28.517 --> 00:32:30.616
Yes. I remember that
because I was at work

596
00:32:30.651 --> 00:32:32.783
and she called me and I mean.
you could tell she was--

597
00:32:32.818 --> 00:32:35.225
she was
so nervous. excited.

598
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.326
And she told me.
you know. such detail.

599
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:38.723
I mean.
there's things that I think

600
00:32:38.758 --> 00:32:40.098
draw us
out there a lot. you know?

601
00:32:40.133 --> 00:32:42.034
Whether
it's the door opening

602
00:32:42.069 --> 00:32:43.497
or the EVP.
we got one time that said.

603
00:32:43.532 --> 00:32:45.235
"I'm in the woods."

604
00:32:48.273 --> 00:32:50.240
I think that
we really should focus a lot

605
00:32:50.275 --> 00:32:52.077
on the uh--
on the backyard.

606
00:32:52.112 --> 00:32:53.672
And I think that's the
heartbeat of what's going on.

607
00:33:12.627 --> 00:33:14.132
-Hello.
-Jill.

608
00:33:14.167 --> 00:33:15.496
-It's good to see you.
-Hey.

609
00:33:15.531 --> 00:33:16.695
good to see you too.

610
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.071
I'm excited that.
uh. Jill Morris.

611
00:33:19.106 --> 00:33:20.435
who came last time.

612
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.405
is coming back
because she did have a lot of

613
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.178
accurate statements
and intuitive things

614
00:33:27.213 --> 00:33:29.312
that were borne out
by things that happened.

615
00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:34.119
There is a female
that I'm not familiar with

616
00:33:34.154 --> 00:33:36.187
that has been
coming here

617
00:33:36.222 --> 00:33:39.355
and she brings
with her a lot of music.

618
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.292
Does that
mean anything to you?

619
00:33:42.327 --> 00:33:43.623
It does.

620
00:33:43.658 --> 00:33:46.857
And I kept
hearing music

621
00:33:46.892 --> 00:33:49.266
that almost
sounded like a music box.

622
00:33:49.301 --> 00:33:52.566
That's exactly what we hear.

623
00:33:52.601 --> 00:33:53.831
She was standing--

624
00:33:53.866 --> 00:33:55.866
like I was here
and she was standing

625
00:33:55.901 --> 00:33:58.638
more towards the door.
so whatever this area

626
00:33:58.673 --> 00:34:00.409
where the table
is over there--

627
00:34:00.444 --> 00:34:02.312
And she was just
twirling around.

628
00:34:02.347 --> 00:34:04.446
pulling all of these
beautiful lights in

629
00:34:04.481 --> 00:34:07.185
with this beautiful music
playing in the background.

630
00:34:07.583 --> 00:34:10.254
What I did
is the name Rich came up.

631
00:34:10.289 --> 00:34:12.784
then Richardson. and I'm like.
"What does this mean?"

632
00:34:12.819 --> 00:34:16.392
There is a waltz that goes back
to the state of South Carolina.

633
00:34:16.856 --> 00:34:18.460
Does--
do you have any community--

634
00:34:18.495 --> 00:34:20.231
Anything to do
with South Carolina?

635
00:34:20.497 --> 00:34:22.365
Yes.
that's where they're from.

636
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.467
We have a genealogy book
that traces the family back--

637
00:34:25.502 --> 00:34:28.107
This. for crying out loud.

638
00:34:30.309 --> 00:34:33.640
Then we have
this spirit.

639
00:34:34.742 --> 00:34:37.281
And I call him
the Reverend.

640
00:34:37.316 --> 00:34:40.185
I wouldn't say
he was evil by any means.

641
00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.912
He's just
a dark person.

642
00:34:41.947 --> 00:34:45.850
He just seemed to be
when he was alive.

643
00:34:45.885 --> 00:34:47.621
which carries over...

644
00:34:49.493 --> 00:34:50.558
angry.

645
00:34:52.265 --> 00:34:55.266
They were-- this area.
this land may have been his

646
00:34:55.301 --> 00:34:58.632
or he had something to do
with this land at one time.

647
00:34:58.667 --> 00:34:59.897
I'm just
going to say it.

648
00:34:59.932 --> 00:35:01.503
It's almost like.
don't find out about me.

649
00:35:01.538 --> 00:35:03.802
Like. it's because
it's an exposure.

650
00:35:04.343 --> 00:35:06.178
He was not a nice person
and I do think

651
00:35:06.213 --> 00:35:09.742
he had a hand in
what happened in the backyard.

652
00:35:10.679 --> 00:35:11.843
Okay.

653
00:35:17.422 --> 00:35:20.423
So. this
is the general area.

654
00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.162
Just going to be honest.

655
00:35:24.264 --> 00:35:26.561
He was taken here.
I think he was hung here.

656
00:35:28.433 --> 00:35:30.730
There was
a debt to be paid

657
00:35:30.765 --> 00:35:33.799
and he--
he was killed.

658
00:35:33.834 --> 00:35:35.702
It's not that
he stole something.

659
00:35:36.309 --> 00:35:39.673
And that's kind of
what his message is right now

660
00:35:39.708 --> 00:35:41.510
speaking with you.

661
00:35:41.545 --> 00:35:44.414
is to know he's not
going to disrespect you.

662
00:35:44.449 --> 00:35:47.615
It's-- he wants people to
understand he was a good man.

663
00:35:48.585 --> 00:35:50.486
But I think the reason
he is really strong here

664
00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:52.983
is because
this is where he passed.

665
00:35:53.018 --> 00:35:54.457
That's my opinion.

666
00:35:55.559 --> 00:35:57.592
But he tends
to hang out here.

667
00:35:58.727 --> 00:36:01.299
You know.
I don't work with psychics.

668
00:36:01.334 --> 00:36:02.729
you know. that much.

669
00:36:02.764 --> 00:36:05.765
But my job here is
to service the investigation.

670
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.702
to service what Alice wants.
to facilitate that.

671
00:36:08.737 --> 00:36:11.705
So if the team
wants another psychic here.

672
00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.740
you know. we're going to
bring one in for them.

673
00:36:13.775 --> 00:36:15.577
And I thought
it was important to make sure

674
00:36:15.612 --> 00:36:17.645
that is a psychic
who has never been

675
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.218
to the house before.

676
00:36:27.954 --> 00:36:29.360
-Oh. Hello.
-Hello.

677
00:36:29.395 --> 00:36:30.724
-How are you? I'm Alice.
-Hey. I'm Sam.

678
00:36:30.759 --> 00:36:32.528
-Nice to meet you.
-Hey. nice to meet you.

679
00:36:32.563 --> 00:36:33.628
Come in.

680
00:36:33.663 --> 00:36:37.863
♪

681
00:36:37.898 --> 00:36:40.404
So. here we are.

682
00:36:40.439 --> 00:36:41.933
Yeah.
so. I'll tell you. like. I--

683
00:36:41.968 --> 00:36:43.473
Like. as soon as
I came on the property.

684
00:36:43.508 --> 00:36:47.378
I definitely started
having anxiety issues.

685
00:36:47.413 --> 00:36:49.479
So when it comes
to my abilities

686
00:36:49.514 --> 00:36:52.383
as a clairvoyant and as
a light of trance medium.

687
00:36:52.418 --> 00:36:55.452
I've learned to kind of
separate my emotions

688
00:36:55.487 --> 00:36:56.915
from the emotions
of the spirits

689
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:58.455
that I'm communicating with.

690
00:36:59.359 --> 00:37:00.853
So. I came in
with my guard up.

691
00:37:00.888 --> 00:37:03.592
I-- I did feel
not welcomed

692
00:37:03.627 --> 00:37:05.495
when I first walked up
to the property.

693
00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:07.431
So. I was feeling
sort of the--

694
00:37:07.466 --> 00:37:09.565
the energy. the chaos.

695
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.568
So. what I've been picking up
on for the past few days

696
00:37:12.603 --> 00:37:14.636
is there's
an older gentleman.

697
00:37:14.671 --> 00:37:17.474
uh.
who wants to communicate.

698
00:37:17.509 --> 00:37:20.873
And he definitely
is the type of person that.

699
00:37:20.908 --> 00:37:23.315
uh. very cranky.

700
00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.912
So when I was coming in.
he was like.

701
00:37:26.947 --> 00:37:28.881
basically telling me
to get out.

702
00:37:28.916 --> 00:37:30.355
Uh. and-- like.

703
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:31.653
"This is my land.

704
00:37:31.688 --> 00:37:33.083
This is my land!"

705
00:37:33.118 --> 00:37:34.722
And. um.

706
00:37:34.757 --> 00:37:36.856
I think that we're going to
see on the property

707
00:37:36.891 --> 00:37:39.056
that there
is definitely. uh.

708
00:37:39.091 --> 00:37:41.663
signs that
he was on the property.

709
00:37:41.698 --> 00:37:44.435
This was not his house.
His house was out back.

710
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:47.537
Now he has stuff
in the back there--

711
00:37:47.572 --> 00:37:48.967
He has secrets
in the back.

712
00:37:49.541 --> 00:37:51.673
Um.
and I hope that we can

713
00:37:51.708 --> 00:37:53.576
maybe uncover
those secrets.

714
00:37:53.908 --> 00:37:55.710
But he's hiding something.

715
00:37:55.745 --> 00:37:56.909
Whoa.

716
00:37:59.716 --> 00:38:01.419
Well. I can see if--
if anybody

717
00:38:01.454 --> 00:38:03.080
has tried to stay
in this room.

718
00:38:03.115 --> 00:38:04.719
like. why they wouldn't
want to stay here.

719
00:38:04.754 --> 00:38:06.820
All right.
I'm going to go there.

720
00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.559
Okay.

721
00:38:11.959 --> 00:38:13.728
Okay.

722
00:38:16.799 --> 00:38:18.865
All right.
What do you want from Alice?

723
00:38:26.644 --> 00:38:28.776
All right.
I'm seeing. um--

724
00:38:32.815 --> 00:38:36.883
He wants you to dig.
Uh. dig out in the back.

725
00:38:37.655 --> 00:38:40.755
Okay. um. he's showing me
that he wants you to dig.

726
00:38:41.153 --> 00:38:42.988
Um. you-- there's something
hidden down there.

727
00:38:43.023 --> 00:38:44.088
I'm getting chills.

728
00:38:44.123 --> 00:38:45.463
My back and my neck

729
00:38:45.498 --> 00:38:47.696
is being touched right now.

730
00:38:48.061 --> 00:38:49.500
Um.

731
00:38:50.129 --> 00:38:52.536
Well. when I was connecting
with the spirit

732
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:54.439
of the older man.
he kept saying.

733
00:38:54.474 --> 00:38:56.441
"Dig. dig. dig."

734
00:38:59.479 --> 00:39:01.809
All right. sir. so I want you
to tell me where to dig.

735
00:39:02.515 --> 00:39:03.844
Give me a sign.

736
00:39:07.784 --> 00:39:10.048
All right.
can you show me where--

737
00:39:10.083 --> 00:39:11.753
Uh.
where you want to dig?

738
00:39:11.788 --> 00:39:13.788
I guess give me
some animal indication

739
00:39:13.823 --> 00:39:15.526
or some sort.

740
00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.661
All right.
So I'm going to keep walking.

741
00:39:18.696 --> 00:39:20.531
Okay. that's interesting.

742
00:39:20.566 --> 00:39:25.602
♪

743
00:39:27.936 --> 00:39:29.903
All right. so I'm gett--
I'm getting--

744
00:39:29.938 --> 00:39:32.906
I'm getting a flashback
to someone getting.

745
00:39:32.941 --> 00:39:34.446
like.
an attack over here.

746
00:39:34.481 --> 00:39:35.909
So there was
some kind of--

747
00:39:39.046 --> 00:39:44.082
♪

748
00:39:44.557 --> 00:39:46.150
All right.
so just so you-- I mean.

749
00:39:46.185 --> 00:39:47.558
I'm going--
I'm just going to go there.

750
00:39:47.593 --> 00:39:48.922
-Yeah.
-Okay.

751
00:39:48.957 --> 00:39:52.761
Um. so there was
definitely tensions going on.

752
00:39:52.796 --> 00:39:54.631
Um.
I think that there was--

753
00:39:54.666 --> 00:39:58.129
there was an attack.
maybe even. uh. something

754
00:39:58.164 --> 00:39:59.801
like a lynching
of some sort

755
00:39:59.836 --> 00:40:01.638
that could have
happened back here too.

756
00:40:03.708 --> 00:40:05.202
The animals
responding to me is--

757
00:40:05.237 --> 00:40:06.577
means that
that's the truth.

758
00:40:16.886 --> 00:40:18.754
-Jill.
-Nice to meet you. Sam.

759
00:40:18.789 --> 00:40:20.591
It's nice to meet you. Sam.

760
00:40:22.628 --> 00:40:24.254
So. you've had
a chance to kind of

761
00:40:24.289 --> 00:40:26.091
get your own vibe.
what's going on?

762
00:40:26.126 --> 00:40:28.698
I feel like that the land
is stained with blood.

763
00:40:28.733 --> 00:40:30.095
There's something out there

764
00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:31.767
that we should
probably investigate.

765
00:40:32.198 --> 00:40:33.835
I am hearing

766
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.574
a really
super pitch high frequency.

767
00:40:36.609 --> 00:40:38.609
-Oh. me too. Yeah.
-Okay.

768
00:40:38.644 --> 00:40:40.644
So. have you
ever heard that before?

769
00:40:40.679 --> 00:40:43.614
I know you said static and
I've heard that here before.

770
00:40:43.649 --> 00:40:45.110
Yeah. I heard--
when you said you heard it

771
00:40:45.145 --> 00:40:47.178
in that back room.
I did. too.

772
00:40:47.213 --> 00:40:48.784
You want to go check it out?

773
00:40:48.819 --> 00:40:50.280
-Yeah.
-Be careful

774
00:40:50.315 --> 00:40:52.755
because
this is new for me.

775
00:40:53.758 --> 00:40:56.154
And see.
it picks up in here.

776
00:40:56.189 --> 00:40:57.254
Yep.

777
00:40:57.289 --> 00:40:59.531
Okay.
So. this is new.

778
00:41:01.161 --> 00:41:03.634
And I was trying to
get my bearings.

779
00:41:04.868 --> 00:41:06.604
It does seem
over the bed.

780
00:41:06.639 --> 00:41:08.540
-Yeah. it's over here.
-It's over the be--

781
00:41:08.575 --> 00:41:10.234
It's like super loud
over here.

782
00:41:10.269 --> 00:41:11.301
Over there. Yeah.

783
00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:12.610
I will say this thing

784
00:41:12.645 --> 00:41:14.007
wants to attach to one of us.

785
00:41:14.042 --> 00:41:15.580
There is a male

786
00:41:15.615 --> 00:41:16.878
and that's
what he is trying to do.

787
00:41:16.913 --> 00:41:19.551
And it's odd you say that
because I get it

788
00:41:19.586 --> 00:41:21.619
right outside the house.

789
00:41:21.654 --> 00:41:23.753
whereas
the last time I was here.

790
00:41:23.788 --> 00:41:26.624
he was in the house
and he was very unpleasant.

791
00:41:26.659 --> 00:41:28.318
Right.
Was he the murderer?

792
00:41:28.353 --> 00:41:29.891
Do you think
that he's the one--

793
00:41:29.926 --> 00:41:31.728
I think he had
something to do with it.

794
00:41:31.763 --> 00:41:34.060
And it's spending. what.
a couple hours out in the back.

795
00:41:35.294 --> 00:41:37.195
It really gave me

796
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.703
a good chance
to pick up on--

797
00:41:39.738 --> 00:41:43.300
there is a spirit
of an enslaved person.

798
00:41:43.335 --> 00:41:44.873
Oh. my gosh.
Okay. you're right.

799
00:41:44.908 --> 00:41:46.644
That's what
I was picking up too.

800
00:41:46.679 --> 00:41:47.909
So it is something--

801
00:41:47.944 --> 00:41:49.174
You actually said lynching.

802
00:41:49.209 --> 00:41:50.714
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

803
00:41:50.749 --> 00:41:52.342
And that's--
that's what I picked up on.

804
00:41:52.377 --> 00:41:54.113
And there's a--
I'll show you that.

805
00:41:54.148 --> 00:41:55.653
You got-- You did?

806
00:41:55.688 --> 00:41:57.182
Okay.
this is giving me chills.

807
00:41:57.217 --> 00:41:58.689
Yeah.

808
00:41:59.791 --> 00:42:01.021
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

809
00:42:03.058 --> 00:42:04.123
Yeah.

810
00:42:08.228 --> 00:42:09.634
Do you want to take a moment?

811
00:42:09.669 --> 00:42:11.834
Yeah.
Oh. I'm sorry.

812
00:42:13.772 --> 00:42:15.904
I just--
I sort of trusted myself

813
00:42:15.939 --> 00:42:17.807
because I did see that.
but I was just like.

814
00:42:17.842 --> 00:42:20.073
I didn't
want to go there. you know?

815
00:42:20.108 --> 00:42:21.173
Because it's so horrific.

816
00:42:21.208 --> 00:42:22.207
Like. who would do that

817
00:42:22.242 --> 00:42:23.648
to somebody else. you know?

818
00:42:24.915 --> 00:42:28.950
Working with Jill
on this collaboration

819
00:42:28.985 --> 00:42:30.688
was awesome for me

820
00:42:30.723 --> 00:42:33.625
because I was able to
get a confirmation

821
00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.989
for the things
that I was picking up.

822
00:42:35.794 --> 00:42:38.993
He-- he is--
his spirit is very grateful.

823
00:42:39.666 --> 00:42:41.094
So just know that.

824
00:42:41.129 --> 00:42:44.328
And I--
I want him to know and I want--

825
00:42:44.363 --> 00:42:46.836
I want you
to know that

826
00:42:46.871 --> 00:42:49.839
his story
has been heard

827
00:42:49.874 --> 00:42:53.304
and he's no longer
a man without a voice.

828
00:42:53.339 --> 00:42:55.812
He now has a voice
and he can speak freely

829
00:42:55.847 --> 00:42:58.749
and hopefully
he can move on to Heaven.

830
00:43:01.754 --> 00:43:03.347

-Yeah. yeah.

831

-Healing?
-Healing. that's it.

833

-Just on that chair.

something dimmed.

882
00:46:21.085 --> 00:46:22.480

the room dimmed.

883

Alice. they know
your voice better than anybody.

884
00:46:31.194 --> 00:46:33.524
So. any--
any. anything you have.

885

886
00:46:36.232 --> 00:46:38.331

890

so you're telling me that

00:50:33.832 --> 00:50:36.569
each red flag
is a potential body?

953
00:50:36.604 --> 00:50:38.175
Yeah. Yeah.

954
00:50:38.474 --> 00:50:41.145
We had
a geophysicist come here

955
00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:43.114
and she marked
some places that she thought

956
00:50:43.149 --> 00:50:45.248
were possible burial sites.

957
00:50:45.283 --> 00:50:47.250
We had ground-penetrating
radar come

958
00:50:47.285 --> 00:50:49.318
and he marked places
that he thought

959
00:50:49.353 --> 00:50:52.222
were possible unmarked graves.

960
00:50:52.257 --> 00:50:54.422
You know. doing research
with Mary Alice.

961
00:50:54.457 --> 00:50:57.557
it does seem that
this property could have been

962
00:50:57.592 --> 00:50:59.856
part of all
of these properties. honestly.

963
00:50:59.891 --> 00:51:02.793
part of
the original graveyard.

964
00:51:02.828 --> 00:51:05.730
And that everything
else was moved

965
00:51:05.765 --> 00:51:08.271
but they just
left the bodies.

966
00:51:08.306 --> 00:51:10.405
You know. that--
that is a possible scenario.

967
00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.671
So I wanted to see
if Alice and the team

968
00:51:12.706 --> 00:51:14.211
wanted to dig there.

969
00:51:14.246 --> 00:51:15.707
And that.
ethically. you know.

970
00:51:15.742 --> 00:51:17.544
that's a bit of a gray area.

971
00:51:17.579 --> 00:51:19.183
You know.
should you shouldn't you?

972
00:51:19.218 --> 00:51:20.844
But I thought
it would be important

973
00:51:20.879 --> 00:51:22.615
for a few different reasons.

974
00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:25.321
One. if we found something.
we could offer proper burial.

975
00:51:25.356 --> 00:51:28.687
We could do things
that could possibly get Alice

976
00:51:28.722 --> 00:51:31.525
to feel better in terms of
the phenomena happening here.

977
00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.890
And maybe show Alice
that it is something

978
00:51:33.925 --> 00:51:36.695
that is human in nature.
that it could have been

979
00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:38.268
a person that was once alive.

980
00:51:38.303 --> 00:51:40.501
And it's not
as scary as it could be

981
00:51:40.536 --> 00:51:43.273
if it was something that
she couldn't put a face to.

982
00:51:43.308 --> 00:51:45.539
If we did find any bodies

983
00:51:45.574 --> 00:51:48.245
or any remnants of
an old foundation or anything.

984
00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.577
that there was
a structure there at one point.

985
00:51:50.612 --> 00:51:53.283
it would make her
feel a little bit better.

986
00:51:53.318 --> 00:51:55.615
If it's bodies
that's more modern.

987
00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.816
There's a chance there may be
buried with personal items...

988
00:51:59.654 --> 00:52:01.951
and a metal detector
could possibly pick up

989
00:52:01.986 --> 00:52:04.294
buttons or rings.

990
00:52:04.329 --> 00:52:06.230
-It's just an idea.
-No. it's a good idea.

991
00:52:06.265 --> 00:52:07.495
Actually. that's a great idea.

992
00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:10.795
Because if you
do find artifacts. right?

993
00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:12.830
Like anything that looks like
it belonged to a family...

994
00:52:13.437 --> 00:52:16.471
we can use those items
as trigger objects.

995
00:52:16.836 --> 00:52:19.243
Here's what we need to do
is get the excavator over here

996
00:52:19.278 --> 00:52:21.542

getting it into the ground.

997

use your metal detector.

-Good. How are you?

1054
00:55:35.067 --> 00:55:36.836
-Good. I'm good.
-Oh. man! Thank you.

1055
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:39.102
Elizabeth.
I've known for quite some time.

1056
00:55:39.137 --> 00:55:40.741
I've actually
never worked with her

1057
00:55:40.776 --> 00:55:43.744
but I know her background
in electrical engineering.

1058
00:55:43.779 --> 00:55:46.483
I know that she
likes to build equipment.

1059
00:55:46.518 --> 00:55:48.144
So. I thought it was
really important to have

1060
00:55:48.179 --> 00:55:50.619
somebody come in
that can build equipment

1061
00:55:50.654 --> 00:55:52.984
and tailor it
to certain experiences.

1062
00:55:53.019 --> 00:55:54.788
to certain types of phenomena.

1063
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.626
Having a background
in electrical engineering

1064
00:55:57.661 --> 00:55:59.727
has actually been
really advantageous

1065
00:55:59.762 --> 00:56:01.190
when I go
on my investigations.

1066
00:56:01.225 --> 00:56:02.895
-Hi!
-I'm Alice.

1067
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:04.765
-I'm Elizabeth.
-It's nice to meet you.

1068
00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.734
-It's great to meet you. too.
-Yeah. come on in.

1069
00:56:06.769 --> 00:56:08.670
You know. I look
at things a little differently.

1070
00:56:08.705 --> 00:56:11.607
Like. it's exciting
when you have an experience

1071
00:56:11.642 --> 00:56:14.610
but there's
always this side of me

1072
00:56:14.645 --> 00:56:16.711
that is looking
for another explanation.

1073
00:56:16.746 --> 00:56:18.647
I don't know a lot about you.
of your equipment

1074
00:56:18.682 --> 00:56:19.747
and electrical stuff
and all that.

1075
00:56:19.782 --> 00:56:21.144
But I think it's fascinating.

1076
00:56:21.179 --> 00:56:22.750
I would like to see

1077
00:56:22.785 --> 00:56:24.180
how it works
and see what you get.

1078
00:56:24.215 --> 00:56:26.919
I think it's great
that Alice is open

1079
00:56:26.954 --> 00:56:29.955
to the possibilities here
of what could be going on.

1080
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:33.662
You know. a lot of times you go
to a residential location

1081
00:56:33.697 --> 00:56:35.499
and they already
have it in their mind

1082
00:56:35.534 --> 00:56:37.061
what they think is going on.

1083
00:56:37.096 --> 00:56:39.899
It doesn't leave a lot of room
for finding out real answers.

1084
00:56:40.704 --> 00:56:42.198
They're so
wrapped up in the idea

1085
00:56:42.233 --> 00:56:44.002
that this is the haunted place
and this happens

1086
00:56:44.037 --> 00:56:45.542
and that happens.

1087
00:56:45.577 --> 00:56:47.841
And you can't possibly
show them anything else.

1088
00:56:47.876 --> 00:56:51.075
Where here. Miss Alice
and the team just want to know

1089
00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:52.142
what's causing these things.

1090
00:56:52.177 --> 00:56:53.550
Is it natural?

1091
00:56:53.585 --> 00:56:54.947
Is it some
supernatural phenomenon?

1092
00:56:54.982 --> 00:56:57.015
Or-- It's nice
that it's not like. "This is--

1093
00:56:57.050 --> 00:56:59.215
There's a portal.
there's a demon." and like.

1094
00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:01.118
you know.
it goes down that-- that road.

1095
00:57:01.153 --> 00:57:02.724
Here. it's not like that.

1096
00:57:02.759 --> 00:57:04.561
People are just so excited
to get the evidence.

1097
00:57:04.596 --> 00:57:06.563
And I am with you
100% on that.

1098
00:57:06.598 --> 00:57:08.026
Like.
I am also very excited

1099
00:57:08.061 --> 00:57:10.765
but let's have it be real

1100
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.602
so that we feel
better about the work

1101
00:57:12.637 --> 00:57:13.900
that we're doing
in this field.

1102
00:57:16.201 --> 00:57:18.971
So this has
an accelerometer inside

1103
00:57:19.006 --> 00:57:22.139
that pretty much is a center
that monitors any movement.

1104
00:57:29.214 --> 00:57:30.719
Do any of these
balls ever move?

1105
00:57:30.754 --> 00:57:32.116
The ones that are back here?
Yeah?

1106
00:57:32.151 --> 00:57:33.689
Not from back there.
Just--

1107
00:57:33.724 --> 00:57:34.921
Yeah. when they're--
Just the stairwell?

1108
00:57:34.956 --> 00:57:36.252
Yeah.

1109
00:57:36.287 --> 00:57:37.858
Other balls
have moved. too?

1110
00:57:37.893 --> 00:57:39.629
Well. if-- if-- Whatever
we asked. those--

1111
00:57:39.664 --> 00:57:41.125
-Hello!
-Hey. man!

1112
00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.533
-How's it going?
-Hey. hey!

1113
00:57:42.568 --> 00:57:43.734
-How you doing? Dustin.
-Man.

1114
00:57:43.769 --> 00:57:45.602
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you. man.

1115
00:57:45.637 --> 00:57:46.867
-What's up?
-Nice to meet you.

1116
00:57:46.902 --> 00:57:48.198
-Nice to meet you as well--
-Hey!

1117
00:57:48.233 --> 00:57:49.771
-Hey!
-How are you?

1118
00:57:49.806 --> 00:57:51.267
-Elizabeth.
-I know who you are.

1119
00:57:51.302 --> 00:57:52.807
-So nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you. too.

1120
00:57:52.842 --> 00:57:54.611
Great to see you guys.

1121
00:57:54.646 --> 00:57:55.876
Something I love
about Brad and John

1122
00:57:55.911 --> 00:57:57.240
is. honestly.
they're so compelled

1123
00:57:57.275 --> 00:57:58.978
to find Alice answers.

1124
00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:02.146
When it comes to the equipment
in the paranormal community.

1125
00:58:02.181 --> 00:58:03.917
it's very. very limited.

1126
00:58:04.623 --> 00:58:06.018
You have to understand. like.

1127
00:58:06.053 --> 00:58:09.659
these are items that are
being mass produced for sale.

1128
00:58:09.991 --> 00:58:11.628
You know?

1129
00:58:11.663 --> 00:58:13.861
They're not sent data sheets
on what kind of sensors

1130
00:58:13.896 --> 00:58:15.830
are involved
inside the equipment.

1131
00:58:16.195 --> 00:58:18.030
You know. I kind of feel
one of the biggest problems

1132
00:58:18.065 --> 00:58:20.901
with paranormal research
is that everyone's always.

1133
00:58:20.936 --> 00:58:23.167
as I say.
singing from the same hymnal.

1134
00:58:23.202 --> 00:58:24.707
You know.
we get all these devices

1135
00:58:24.742 --> 00:58:26.203
and what do we do
to make new ones?

1136
00:58:26.238 --> 00:58:28.040
We just put
a new light on it.

1137
00:58:28.075 --> 00:58:30.911
You see some lights go off.
you hear an alarm go off.

1138
00:58:30.946 --> 00:58:34.277
And you're like. "Ooh. ah."
like. "There's something here."

1139
00:58:34.312 --> 00:58:35.883
But that's not the case.

1140
00:58:35.918 --> 00:58:37.247
You know. like.
there's so many other factors

1141
00:58:37.282 --> 00:58:39.051
to take
into consideration.

1142
00:58:39.086 --> 00:58:40.316
Or we combined. you know--

1143
00:58:40.351 --> 00:58:41.790
"Now it has
two features in one."

1144
00:58:41.825 --> 00:58:43.088
It's like.
but it's really nothing new.

1145
00:58:43.123 --> 00:58:44.595
It's the same thing.

1146
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:46.091
And I think that...

1147
00:58:47.292 --> 00:58:48.797
there has to be expansion

1148
00:58:48.832 --> 00:58:51.129
outside of the community
to kind of understand

1149
00:58:51.164 --> 00:58:52.834
the tools that they're using.

1150
00:58:53.166 --> 00:58:55.133
And to also understand

1151
00:58:55.168 --> 00:58:56.640
all the false positives

1152
00:58:56.675 --> 00:58:58.268
that they are getting
in the process.

1153
00:58:58.809 --> 00:59:00.809
Coming to the house.
I did want to create

1154
00:59:00.844 --> 00:59:03.647
and-- and kind of customize
things that made sense

1155
00:59:03.682 --> 00:59:05.913
to what you guys
experience here. you know?

1156
00:59:05.948 --> 00:59:07.981
And everything
that you documented before.

1157
00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.687
And. you know. I--

1158
00:59:10.722 --> 00:59:13.382
I like to
sometimes do things

1159
00:59:13.417 --> 00:59:15.791
that other people
wouldn't necessarily do

1160
00:59:15.826 --> 00:59:17.254
just because
if we don't try it.

1161
00:59:17.289 --> 00:59:18.860
we won't know
what's going to work.

1162
00:59:19.357 --> 00:59:21.357
I have great respect
for Elizabeth Saint.

1163
00:59:21.392 --> 00:59:22.897
having known her
over the years.

1164
00:59:22.932 --> 00:59:24.393
having traveled from.
you know.

1165
00:59:24.428 --> 00:59:26.098
conventions
and things together

1166
00:59:26.133 --> 00:59:28.298
and knowing that Elizabeth
goes out of her way

1167
00:59:28.333 --> 00:59:30.036
to make specific equipment

1168
00:59:30.071 --> 00:59:32.203
like the light anomaly
that's here.

1169
00:59:32.238 --> 00:59:35.976
This is the-- the light sensor
I told you about.

1170
00:59:36.011 --> 00:59:38.814
So maybe if we do see
any light anomalies.

1171
00:59:38.849 --> 00:59:40.882
we might be able to--
It'll let us know

1172
00:59:40.917 --> 00:59:43.753
by the color
that it shines. essentially.

1173
00:59:43.788 --> 00:59:45.854
She developed something
to look for those lights

1174
00:59:45.889 --> 00:59:47.856
and then to try to figure out
which color lights it is.

1175
00:59:47.891 --> 00:59:49.726
And it lights up responsively.

1176
00:59:49.761 --> 00:59:50.892
And the most famous thing.

1177
00:59:50.927 --> 00:59:52.256
the ball moving
down the stairs.

1178
00:59:52.291 --> 00:59:54.225
So she makes
a ball that she can

1179
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.831
measure any slight movement.

1180
00:59:55.866 --> 00:59:58.196
So. what's
unique about this is. um.

1181
00:59:58.231 --> 00:59:59.362
I call it
the comm sphere.

1182
00:59:59.936 --> 01:00:02.838
And it actually
communicates with my phone.

1183
01:00:02.873 --> 01:00:06.237
The Y x or Z axis and it
goes right to her software.

1184
01:00:06.272 --> 01:00:07.304
And it sends her an alert.

1185
01:00:07.339 --> 01:00:09.075
So it'll show me values

1186
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:12.782
in the X. Y. Z direction.
if it moves.

1187
01:00:12.817 --> 01:00:15.884
To have the passion to say.

1188
01:00:15.919 --> 01:00:17.380
"I'm doing this case.

1189
01:00:17.415 --> 01:00:19.085
What's the type of activity?

1190
01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.054
What can I make
specifically that will speak

1191
01:00:21.089 --> 01:00:24.024
to trying to measure
that type of activity?"

1192
01:00:24.059 --> 01:00:25.762
I mean. that's--
I have trouble

1193
01:00:25.797 --> 01:00:27.324
getting on the Wi-Fi sometimes.

1194
01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:29.062
She's like.
light years above that.

1195
01:00:29.097 --> 01:00:32.032
So. I've known Dustin Perry
for a few years now.

1196
01:00:32.067 --> 01:00:34.771
And we've
always seen each other like.

1197
01:00:34.806 --> 01:00:36.267
on the road or.
you know.

1198
01:00:36.302 --> 01:00:37.939
the--
the paranormal community

1199
01:00:37.974 --> 01:00:39.743
is very. like.
tight knit community.

1200
01:00:39.778 --> 01:00:40.975
so we've always
run into each other.

1201
01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:42.911
But I've never
had the opportunity

1202
01:00:42.946 --> 01:00:45.441
to actually work with him.
so I'm really excited

1203
01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:47.245
that I'll be
able to do that here.

1204
01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.917
Um. Alice.

1205
01:00:48.952 --> 01:00:50.380
She seems to really
embrace what's going on here.

1206
01:00:50.415 --> 01:00:53.119
which is odd because she also
seems to be afraid of it.

1207
01:00:53.154 --> 01:00:55.858
And all I want to do
is go upstairs and to the left.

1208
01:00:55.893 --> 01:00:57.156
Ever since
I've walked in the house.

1209
01:00:57.191 --> 01:00:58.388
-Really?
-Yeah.

1210
01:00:58.423 --> 01:00:59.422
When I first
walked into the house.

1211
01:00:59.457 --> 01:01:00.489
I even told her that.

1212
01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:01.963
When I first walked in.

1213
01:01:01.998 --> 01:01:04.328
I was immediately
drawn to that door frame.

1214
01:01:04.363 --> 01:01:05.802
Yeah. yeah. for sure.

1215
01:01:05.837 --> 01:01:07.232
Just based on
years of experience

1216
01:01:07.267 --> 01:01:08.398
and feeling
drawn to places

1217
01:01:08.433 --> 01:01:10.103
like that seems
to be the place.

1218
01:01:10.138 --> 01:01:11.973
-Me too. Yeah.
-So.

1219
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:16.076
Just a couple
of trip hazards here.

1220
01:01:16.111 --> 01:01:17.176
Yeah.

1221
01:01:17.211 --> 01:01:21.785
♪

1222
01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.017
It's interesting too.
because we have

1223
01:01:23.052 --> 01:01:24.414
the three mirrors
like you said here.

1224
01:01:24.449 --> 01:01:26.053
And then.
there's another right there.

1225
01:01:26.088 --> 01:01:28.253
I was just trying to think
for light purposes too

1226
01:01:28.288 --> 01:01:29.518
but if the door's closed.

1227
01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:30.860
she does have this-- What?

1228
01:01:30.895 --> 01:01:32.191
Is this is a balcony area?

1229
01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:33.863
I--

1230
01:01:33.898 --> 01:01:35.095
But there's no road there.

1231
01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:36.360
So. you're
not getting any. like.

1232
01:01:36.395 --> 01:01:37.295
car light
coming in through there?

1233
01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:38.395
No.

1234
01:01:39.564 --> 01:01:41.937
Because I was just trying
to think for bouncing light.

1235
01:01:41.972 --> 01:01:44.104
We are close
to the road in the front.

1236
01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:48.207
Watch that wire.

1237
01:01:51.575 --> 01:01:53.278
It's just
a-- a walk-in?

1238
01:01:56.514 --> 01:01:57.986
What's with all the mirrors?

1239
01:01:58.021 --> 01:01:59.416
There's one on the floor.

1240
01:02:00.155 --> 01:02:03.123
I don't know.
There is a crawlspace.

1241
01:02:04.929 --> 01:02:06.159
-Oh. is there?
-Yeah.

1242
01:02:09.296 --> 01:02:12.033
I-- I can't really open it.
Stay right there.

1243
01:02:12.431 --> 01:02:13.969
Do you know
if anyone's ever been?

1244
01:02:14.466 --> 01:02:16.169
No one's gone
in the crawlspace?

1245
01:02:16.468 --> 01:02:18.204
We have to go
in the crawlspace.

1246
01:02:18.239 --> 01:02:20.173
Yeah. we definitely
have to go in the crawlspace.

1247
01:02:20.208 --> 01:02:21.911
-Is there asbestos?
-Uh. no. That's uh--

1248
01:02:21.946 --> 01:02:23.275
It was put in the 90s.
That's pink.

1249
01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:25.046
-Oh. yeah.
-Yeah. Oh.

1250
01:02:25.884 --> 01:02:27.246
What is it?

1251
01:02:27.281 --> 01:02:28.918
All my hair's
just standing up there.

1252
01:02:28.953 --> 01:02:30.183
It is.

1253
01:02:30.889 --> 01:02:32.548
Like. it just felt like
something. like. grazed me

1254
01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:34.352
and I just
looked down and everything...

1255
01:02:35.025 --> 01:02:36.255
That's so weird.

1256
01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:37.828
It still
feels like more is going.

1257
01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:40.226
It's like you're about
to get electrocuted.

1258
01:02:40.261 --> 01:02:41.832
-Right.
-But right before.

1259
01:02:41.867 --> 01:02:43.064
you know.
you get struck by lightning

1260
01:02:43.099 --> 01:02:44.527
-a lot of times your--
-Yeah.

1261
01:02:44.562 --> 01:02:45.836
-Hair will--
-Yeah. it all did.

1262
01:02:46.168 --> 01:02:47.365
Hair will stand up.

1263
01:02:48.071 --> 01:02:49.367
-That's odd.
-It's weird

1264
01:02:49.402 --> 01:02:50.566
that no one's
been in there.

1265
01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:52.007
I know. right?
For sure.

1266
01:02:52.339 --> 01:02:53.943
Jeez. I'm breaking things.

1267
01:02:56.046 --> 01:02:57.573
It doesn't go
too far back but I mean.

1268
01:02:57.608 --> 01:02:59.047
we could definitely
sit in there and do.

1269
01:02:59.082 --> 01:03:00.312
like an EVP session
or something.

1270
01:03:00.347 --> 01:03:03.051
-Yeah. I think we should.
-Yeah.

1271
01:03:06.892 --> 01:03:09.156
If there's anybody here
that could hear our voice.

1272
01:03:09.191 --> 01:03:12.225
are you able to communicate
by just knocking for us?

1273
01:03:13.459 --> 01:03:14.865
Can you do
something like that?

1274
01:03:26.538 --> 01:03:27.603
How 'bout in here?

1275
01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:32.245
Well.
you heard that. right?

1276
01:03:33.281 --> 01:03:34.885
It sounded
like it was in this--

1277
01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.546
-It sounded inside.
-Yeah.

1278
01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:39.890
Is that a woman's voice?

1279
01:03:40.926 --> 01:03:41.992
-I-- I heard a--
-I heard a knock.

1280
01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:44.158
It sounded like it was
maybe like. a woman's voice

1281
01:03:44.193 --> 01:03:45.390
or something
right before it.

1282
01:03:48.362 --> 01:03:50.263
This happens quick.

1283
01:03:52.003 --> 01:03:54.201
I think we get some good
starting points of ideas

1284
01:03:54.236 --> 01:03:56.368
in terms of trying to do
a focused investigation.

1285
01:03:56.403 --> 01:03:58.238
This area
has already been pretty hot.

1286
01:03:58.273 --> 01:03:59.943
-Yeah.
-We've had knocks and response.

1287
01:03:59.978 --> 01:04:02.506
So. if we do
a session in the crawlspace.

1288
01:04:02.541 --> 01:04:05.377
-Uh-huh.
-Use your ion charger.

1289
01:04:05.412 --> 01:04:07.984
throw that in there for a while
and then repeat the session.

1290
01:04:08.019 --> 01:04:09.546
Right.
And see if there's a change.

1291
01:04:09.581 --> 01:04:11.383
-Yeah.
-I think that's smart.

1292
01:04:11.418 --> 01:04:14.287
I used to have an ion generator
in my bedroom when I was a kid.

1293
01:04:14.322 --> 01:04:16.388
It was like an air purifier
and ion generator.

1294
01:04:16.687 --> 01:04:18.258
I don't know.
My mom bought it on QVC.

1295
01:04:18.293 --> 01:04:20.359
-Okay.
-But it was-- it was nice.

1296
01:04:21.329 --> 01:04:23.395
With ion motors.
it's very interesting.

1297
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:24.968
Like the one I have.

1298
01:04:25.003 --> 01:04:27.069
you can make it
so it's producing positive

1299
01:04:27.104 --> 01:04:29.434
but you can also make it so
it's producing negative ions.

1300
01:04:29.469 --> 01:04:31.073
And it's going to have
a different feeling

1301
01:04:31.108 --> 01:04:32.173
and a different effect.

1302
01:04:32.208 --> 01:04:34.175
I did bring an ion motor.

1303
01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:37.013
but. um. the one I have
is pretty serious.

1304
01:04:37.048 --> 01:04:38.443
Yeah? I love it!

1305
01:04:38.478 --> 01:04:41.083
"I don't want to brag
but the ion motor I have--"

1306
01:04:41.118 --> 01:04:43.283
It's little
but it packs a punch.

1307
01:04:44.022 --> 01:04:45.615
You're going to
go out that way?

1308
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:47.023
-Yes.
-Or not.

1309
01:04:48.752 --> 01:04:50.961
Which one
will go to the garage?

1310
01:04:50.996 --> 01:04:52.457
I don't know
which door's which.

1311
01:04:52.492 --> 01:04:53.689
It's like a labyrinth.

1312
01:04:53.724 --> 01:04:55.064
show already.

1313
01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:56.032
Yeah.
I go here. there.

1314
01:05:04.636 --> 01:05:06.075
What's all this?

1315
01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:08.407
You guys
digging out here?

1316
01:05:15.119 --> 01:05:16.382
Wait. stop for a second.

1317
01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.220
-Do you hear that?

1318
01:05:19.255 --> 01:05:21.189
-What was it?
-Someone's whistling.

1319
01:05:21.521 --> 01:05:23.191
Oh. whistling? Yeah.

1320
01:05:23.721 --> 01:05:25.127
Hello?

1321
01:05:31.531 --> 01:05:32.564
That's what I heard.

1322
01:05:35.337 --> 01:05:37.007
-Well. let me get--
-There. there. there.

1323
01:05:37.042 --> 01:05:38.371
-You don't hear that?

1324
01:05:38.406 --> 01:05:39.702
-I heard it.
-You did?

1325
01:05:39.737 --> 01:05:41.143
Yeah.

1326
01:05:41.673 --> 01:05:43.475
-It was the same tune.
-Yeah.

1327
01:05:46.777 --> 01:05:48.315
That's so weird.

1328
01:05:54.125 --> 01:05:56.059
-Why that tune?
-I know. right?

1329
01:05:56.094 --> 01:05:58.391
-Frère Jacques.
-It is Frère Jacques.

1330
01:06:04.135 --> 01:06:05.530
Is there
something moving back there?

1331
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:07.532
Totally
noise to my right--

1332
01:06:07.567 --> 01:06:09.237
It sounds
like someone's walking.

1333
01:06:09.272 --> 01:06:10.205
There's something
just ran across there.

1334
01:06:14.409 --> 01:06:17.113
I-- I saw something go
like straight across.

1335
01:06:20.085 --> 01:06:22.019
It's a real
person or what?

1336
01:06:22.846 --> 01:06:24.582
Oh. man.

1337
01:06:24.617 --> 01:06:26.617
I heard a woman's voice
over there a couple times.

1338
01:06:26.652 --> 01:06:28.487
You know. Alice.
one thing I will say. though.

1339
01:06:28.522 --> 01:06:31.655
despite all the kind of
touch and go. little bits of.

1340
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:33.756
of activity even inside.

1341
01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:35.692
Like. I don't know.
for me personally.

1342
01:06:35.727 --> 01:06:37.265
I don't feel
anything that feels like.

1343
01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.498
threatening or-- or--
or angry in any way.

1344
01:06:39.533 --> 01:06:41.302
My neighbor said--
she said all these

1345
01:06:41.337 --> 01:06:42.798
they like thinking
she sees people.

1346
01:06:42.833 --> 01:06:44.371
She gets out there.
there's nobody there.

1347
01:06:44.406 --> 01:06:46.505
There's no reading's.
like. out here.

1348
01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.508
but out here
we had this strange whistling.

1349
01:06:49.543 --> 01:06:51.246
-Yeah.
-Sounded like people were

1350
01:06:51.281 --> 01:06:53.149
having conversation back there.

1351
01:06:53.646 --> 01:06:54.711
Also a female voice.

1352
01:06:55.914 --> 01:06:59.419
Um. we heard.
like. footsteps. it seems like.

1353
01:06:59.454 --> 01:07:01.520
You know.
coming back tomorrow

1354
01:07:01.555 --> 01:07:03.456
with more equipment.

1355
01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:05.293
I will be curious to see

1356
01:07:05.328 --> 01:07:07.526
if it responds the same.

1357
01:07:07.561 --> 01:07:09.330
I'm thrilled that you came.
both of you.

1358
01:07:09.365 --> 01:07:10.859
Yeah.
Thank you for having us.

1359
01:07:10.894 --> 01:07:12.300
Thank you very much.
We appreciate it.

1360
01:07:12.335 --> 01:07:15.336
Oh. yeah.
It was our-- our pleasure.

1361
01:07:16.735 --> 01:07:18.108
And we
get to meet Jacques.

1362
01:07:18.143 --> 01:07:19.439
We have a new person
on the team.

1363
01:07:19.474 --> 01:07:21.177
Yeah.
Your little mascot.

1364
01:07:21.212 --> 01:07:22.475
Helps us
dig holes and stuff.

1365
01:07:22.906 --> 01:07:24.708
That's right.
Dig and fill them.

1366
01:07:24.743 --> 01:07:27.381
Yes. Yes.
At least he's courteous.

1367
01:07:27.416 --> 01:07:29.086
Yeah.
that's very nice.

1368
01:07:32.388 --> 01:07:37.424
♪

1369
01:07:45.236 --> 01:07:46.466
Florence.

1370
01:07:46.501 --> 01:07:48.633
a small town
in central Mississippi.

1371
01:07:49.768 --> 01:07:51.207
Maybe you've
never heard of it.

1372
01:07:52.771 --> 01:07:54.243
It has history.

1373
01:07:54.674 --> 01:07:56.410
Some dark history as well.

1374
01:07:56.907 --> 01:07:58.643
There were outlaws here.

1375
01:07:59.316 --> 01:08:02.350
Bad men. charlatans.

1376
01:08:02.385 --> 01:08:04.319
those who would
steal your money.

1377
01:08:04.783 --> 01:08:06.156
Those who would
take your life.

1378
01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:09.225
And like most good stories.
this story happens

1379
01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:11.227
long ago in a place
far away.

1380
01:08:11.262 --> 01:08:12.690
Western South Carolina.

1381
01:08:13.264 --> 01:08:15.594
A ma'am named Nancy Lusk.

1382
01:08:15.926 --> 01:08:17.464
Her middle name was Agnes.

1383
01:08:17.499 --> 01:08:19.169
And I believe
she actually went by Agnes.

1384
01:08:19.204 --> 01:08:21.468
She was born
in a time of war.

1385
01:08:21.503 --> 01:08:23.470
She came of age
in the events

1386
01:08:23.505 --> 01:08:25.637
leading up
to the American Revolution.

1387
01:08:26.409 --> 01:08:27.903
She was 19 years old.

1388
01:08:27.938 --> 01:08:29.806
She warred-- married
a man named William Steen.

1389
01:08:30.512 --> 01:08:31.907
William Steen
will actually fight

1390
01:08:31.942 --> 01:08:33.315
in the American Revolution

1391
01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:34.811
at the Battle
of Kings Mountain.

1392
01:08:34.846 --> 01:08:38.254
So about 1810. William decides
to take his family West

1393
01:08:38.289 --> 01:08:40.388
into the new
Mississippi territory.

1394
01:08:40.423 --> 01:08:42.357
where the land
is rich and fertile.

1395
01:08:42.755 --> 01:08:43.919
During this interval.

1396
01:08:43.954 --> 01:08:45.525
one of these mules
comes up missing.

1397
01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.626
So he goes out
looking for his mule

1398
01:08:47.661 --> 01:08:48.726
and he never returns.

1399
01:08:50.598 --> 01:08:52.796
It was believed
that he might have been killed

1400
01:08:52.831 --> 01:08:54.303
by the Native Americans

1401
01:08:54.338 --> 01:08:55.898
who still claim
this land as their own.

1402
01:08:55.933 --> 01:08:57.834
But nobody
really knows for certain.

1403
01:08:57.869 --> 01:08:59.572
But nonetheless.
he never returns.

1404
01:08:59.607 --> 01:09:02.410
And so Agnes is now
the matriarch of the family

1405
01:09:02.445 --> 01:09:04.775
and she and the rest
for grown children

1406
01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:06.777
push on
and complete the journey.

1407
01:09:07.450 --> 01:09:08.845
And they settle here.

1408
01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.484
And since they settle.
first settlers.

1409
01:09:10.519 --> 01:09:12.321
it becomes known
as Steen's Creek.

1410
01:09:12.653 --> 01:09:15.390
Uh. by the turn
of the 20th century.

1411
01:09:15.425 --> 01:09:17.590
this area has been known
as Steen Creek for a while.

1412
01:09:18.263 --> 01:09:20.461
And there's
a new rail line coming through.

1413
01:09:21.431 --> 01:09:22.925
They're going
to build a railroad track

1414
01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.499
from the Gulf Coast up into
the capital city of Jackson.

1415
01:09:25.534 --> 01:09:26.830
a few miles
north of here.

1416
01:09:26.865 --> 01:09:28.964
Uh. one gentleman.
Mr. Ellis.

1417
01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:31.571
will donate
the land for the depot

1418
01:09:31.606 --> 01:09:32.539
on one condition.

1419
01:09:32.574 --> 01:09:35.245
He wants that depot
named after his wife.

1420
01:09:35.775 --> 01:09:38.413
Willing to take the free land.
whatever they can.

1421
01:09:38.448 --> 01:09:41.317
the depot is actually named
Florence Depot

1422
01:09:41.352 --> 01:09:43.319
rather than Steen's Creek.

1423
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:47.983
Most of American
history and again.

1424
01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:49.457
the history
of the world is made--

1425
01:09:49.492 --> 01:09:50.788
It's been a man's world.

1426
01:09:51.362 --> 01:09:53.329
The men take the credit
and are the kings.

1427
01:09:53.364 --> 01:09:55.023
They're the soldiers.
they're the ones that go off

1428
01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:57.564
and everybody
raves about them.

1429
01:09:57.599 --> 01:10:00.468
But back there in--
Behind them in the shadows

1430
01:10:00.503 --> 01:10:01.997
have always been the women

1431
01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:04.538
making sure
the farm is still running.

1432
01:10:04.573 --> 01:10:07.541
making sure there's food
still heading out to the front.

1433
01:10:07.576 --> 01:10:10.412

decisions are being made.

1434

The hand that rocks
the cradle rules the world.

We're going
to build a city.

What are we going to call it?

I don't know for certain.

by this time a lot of people

1440
01:10:25.924 --> 01:10:27.561
had started referring to it

Florence.

What's interesting
even more to me.

this looks like
it's some kind of fabric.

about what this object is

But we're going to extend
the range of it. right?

-So I think that

01:16:40.705 --> 01:16:42.331
by creating a threshold.

1552
01:16:42.366 --> 01:16:45.433
So. if any. like.
subtle energy comes in.

1553
01:16:45.468 --> 01:16:47.072
the hope is that
it sets off the Theremin.

1554
01:16:47.107 --> 01:16:49.008
Right.
That would be great.

1555
01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.782
So. we're just
wrapping the copper wire

1556
01:16:53.817 --> 01:16:56.444
around the. uh. pitch antenna
of the Theremin. here.

1557
01:16:56.479 --> 01:16:58.886
So. this would be
normally how you control

1558
01:16:58.921 --> 01:17:01.383
the. uh-- the pitch sound
by moving your hand closer.

1559
01:17:01.418 --> 01:17:02.857
Completely experimental.

1564
01:17:20.206 --> 01:17:21.304
Now we'll see.

1565
01:17:21.944 --> 01:17:23.779
-Yeah?

1566
01:17:23.814 --> 01:17:25.341
So now it's working
because normally

1567
01:17:25.376 --> 01:17:27.145
you have to be
touching that.

1568
01:17:28.115 --> 01:17:29.180
Go. go in the door.

1569
01:17:30.755 --> 01:17:32.117
-Oh.
-Yeah.

1570
01:17:32.152 --> 01:17:33.822
That time it worked.
Yeah. That time it worked.

1571
01:17:33.857 --> 01:17:35.153
-That worked.
-So it is--

1572
01:17:35.188 --> 01:17:36.385
It's building up
and getting the whole thing.

1573
01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:37.925
-Yeah.
-Yeah--

1574
01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.223
-Oh. see! Can you hear it?
-Yup.

1575
01:17:39.258 --> 01:17:40.730
-That's a lot of fun.

1576
01:17:40.765 --> 01:17:42.127
Oh. that's so fun.

1577
01:17:43.493 --> 01:17:45.031
I love science.

1578
01:17:46.771 --> 01:17:48.166
I like it.
That's great.

1579
01:17:48.971 --> 01:17:50.432
The science community
isn't open

1580
01:17:50.467 --> 01:17:52.500
to the idea
of the paranormal.

1581
01:17:52.535 --> 01:17:55.811
And unfortunately.
the paranormal community

1582
01:17:55.846 --> 01:17:58.506
isn't viewed as--

1583
01:17:58.541 --> 01:18:00.816
It's not taken seriously.
Like. that's a problem.

1584
01:18:00.851 --> 01:18:02.917
We're just
not taken seriously.

1585
01:18:04.118 --> 01:18:05.887
I've always thought
it was interesting

1586
01:18:05.922 --> 01:18:09.154
that for some reason
people think science

1587
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:12.223
and spirituality
have to butt heads.

1588
01:18:12.797 --> 01:18:14.863
You know. the fact
that research scientists

1589
01:18:14.898 --> 01:18:16.964
would be afraid to speak
to somebody about something

1590
01:18:16.999 --> 01:18:19.802
of a spiritual nature
or paranormal nature.

1591
01:18:19.837 --> 01:18:21.463
I think shows that divide.

1592
01:18:21.498 --> 01:18:23.938
And that divide is--
is a problem.

1593
01:18:23.973 --> 01:18:25.973
I would love to get
to a place where the field's

1594
01:18:26.008 --> 01:18:28.536
taken more seriously.
because not only do I think

1595
01:18:28.571 --> 01:18:30.109
the paranormal community
is missing out

1596
01:18:30.144 --> 01:18:31.539
but I also feel
like the science community

1597
01:18:31.574 --> 01:18:32.980
is missing out.

1598
01:18:33.015 --> 01:18:34.509
Do the initial run in here.

1599
01:18:34.544 --> 01:18:36.852
Yeah. I think yesterday-- What?

1600
01:18:37.514 --> 01:18:38.854
I got too close to it.

1601
01:18:38.889 --> 01:18:40.251
-Okay.

1602
01:18:40.286 --> 01:18:42.858
But this is interesting
because if something--

1603
01:18:42.893 --> 01:18:44.860
This doorway
seems to be an active spot

1604
01:18:44.895 --> 01:18:46.422
so if something decides
to walk through here.

1605
01:18:46.457 --> 01:18:48.160
we should be
able to hear it.

1606
01:18:49.196 --> 01:18:50.525
So we're going
to do an experiment.

1607
01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.131
All right.
Very good.

1608
01:18:52.166 --> 01:18:54.265
So first we're going
to do an initial session.

1609
01:18:56.335 --> 01:18:59.138
Everything's beeping.
Did you touch the door?

1610
01:18:59.173 --> 01:19:00.205
No.

if anybody is walking

1623
01:19:47.958 --> 01:19:50.288
in the DVR cameras downstairs?

Okay. so... timestamp.

Can you tell us

I think
he says "Baseball".

1644
01:21:10.304 --> 01:21:12.106
<i>Yeah. right?</i>

1645
01:21:12.504 --> 01:21:14.141
Crazy that
baseball was said.

1646
01:21:14.176 --> 01:21:15.670
Right. For sure.

1647
01:21:15.705 --> 01:21:18.475

-knowing?
-Right.

we charge it up.

1650
01:21:23.218 --> 01:21:25.020
we ask those
questions again.

01:21:25.055 --> 01:21:26.681
-The same exact ones.
-Yeah.

1652
01:21:26.716 --> 01:21:28.221
And see
if there's a change.

1653
01:21:28.256 --> 01:21:29.651
And then maybe we should
throw in another question

1654
01:21:29.686 --> 01:21:31.323
that we don't know
the answer to.

1655
01:21:31.721 --> 01:21:34.997
I did bring an ion motor

1656
01:21:35.032 --> 01:21:36.559
that actually
creates and generates

1657
01:21:36.594 --> 01:21:38.132
its own
positive force field.

1658
01:21:38.167 --> 01:21:40.200
But it's a--
it's a pretty serious one.

1659
01:21:41.698 --> 01:21:43.500
Could be
potentially dangerous.

1660
01:21:43.535 --> 01:21:45.106
I don't know.

1661
01:21:45.141 --> 01:21:46.668
but I want to change
the environment.

1662
01:21:46.703 --> 01:21:48.208
I want to see
what it's like before.

1663
01:21:48.243 --> 01:21:50.408
And I want to see
if you induce anything else

1664
01:21:50.443 --> 01:21:53.642
in the environment.
if that also creates a change.

1665
01:21:53.677 --> 01:21:56.348
If activity increases.

1666
01:21:57.318 --> 01:21:58.251
I can smell it.

1667
01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.994
Can you tell me
what street this house is on?

1668
01:22:08.395 --> 01:22:10.626

something a little different

1704
01:23:35.152 --> 01:23:38.549

Here's the third card.

1711
01:24:01.607 --> 01:24:02.639

1712
01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:06.280
What number?

1713
01:24:09.714 --> 01:24:11.351

1716
01:24:27.897 --> 01:24:29.666

-Bizarre.

blind study thing

1735
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:12.346

No. but let's
back off for a second

1737
01:25:14.284 --> 01:25:15.646
because
it wasn't just that.

1738
01:25:15.681 --> 01:25:17.285
Like at the end.

1739
01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.254
we re-asked
the same questions

1740
01:25:19.289 --> 01:25:21.619
-and we got clearer responses.
-Clearer answers.

1741
01:25:21.654 --> 01:25:22.686
Oh. crap.

1742
01:25:26.329 --> 01:25:28.164
Yeah.
White Road. Alice.

1743
01:25:28.496 --> 01:25:30.265
Said something
about their names.

1744
01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:31.596
I couldn't pick it up.
I thought it said. "Jack."

1745
01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:33.565
Jack.

1746
01:25:36.636 --> 01:25:38.471
Heard. "White Road."
I heard. "Alice."

1747
01:25:38.506 --> 01:25:39.934
-Oh. they did?
-I heard white--

1748
01:25:39.969 --> 01:25:41.606
They got "White Road."
they got. "Alice."

1749
01:25:41.641 --> 01:25:43.509
White Road. damn.
That's where I live.

1750
01:25:43.544 --> 01:25:45.280
I mean. damn.
that's getting personal.

1751
01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:48.580
<i>Here's the third card.</i>

1752
01:25:48.615 --> 01:25:50.384
<i>What color is it?</i>

1753
01:25:50.419 --> 01:25:51.946
<i>-What number?</i>

1754
01:25:51.981 --> 01:25:54.520
Six.
That you hear very clearly.

1755
01:25:54.555 --> 01:25:57.325
-Six. six.
-Did he say. "Six?"

1756
01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:58.953
Getting direct
responses to the card--

1757
01:25:58.988 --> 01:26:00.021
.

1758
01:26:01.595 --> 01:26:03.529
<i>Here's the third card.</i>

1759
01:26:03.564 --> 01:26:05.432
<i>-What color is it?</i>

1760
01:26:05.467 --> 01:26:06.895
-<i> What number?</i>
-Red six.

1761
01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:08.600
Six.

1762
01:26:08.635 --> 01:26:09.964
<i>I'm going to show you</i>

1763
01:26:09.999 --> 01:26:11.306
<i>card four now.</i>

1764
01:26:11.341 --> 01:26:12.637
-That's so wild.
-This is insane.

1765
01:26:12.672 --> 01:26:14.309
<i>Can you tell me what card</i>

1766
01:26:14.344 --> 01:26:15.409
<i>-Dustin is holding?</i>

1767
01:26:15.444 --> 01:26:16.575
Red ten.

1768
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:18.445
But you don't really
get the impact of it

1769
01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:21.481
because it's like-- you know.
there's a conscious being.

1770
01:26:21.516 --> 01:26:25.221
invisible-- invisible.
conscious being in your room.

1771
01:26:25.652 --> 01:26:27.322
I mean. really.
that's a little unnerving.

1772
01:26:27.357 --> 01:26:28.719
I mean. really.
you just go take a shower.

1773
01:26:28.754 --> 01:26:30.556
You think. "Who is
watching me take a shower?"

1774
01:26:30.591 --> 01:26:32.426
I mean. really. you do.
because something's there.

1775
01:26:32.461 --> 01:26:34.230
Some-- something's there.

1776
01:26:36.795 --> 01:26:37.959
Last time we got baseball.

1777
01:26:37.994 --> 01:26:39.433
which was great by itself.

1778
01:26:39.468 --> 01:26:40.929
-Right.
-But now it was

1779
01:26:40.964 --> 01:26:42.502
every question pretty much
had an answer. every card--

1780
01:26:42.537 --> 01:26:43.932
Even if we couldn't
make it out.

1781
01:26:43.967 --> 01:26:45.373
Yeah.

1782
01:26:45.408 --> 01:26:47.408
-The cards are wild. though.
-Yeah.

1783
01:26:47.443 --> 01:26:49.344
Yeah. like. it just--
it just blows my mind.

1784
01:26:49.379 --> 01:26:52.006
Of all the years doing this.
like I've never had--

1785
01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:53.975
I mean.
you're lucky if you get an EVP.

1786
01:26:54.010 --> 01:26:56.483
It's still pretty good.

1787
01:26:56.947 --> 01:26:59.915
So much more
could be found out.

1788
01:26:59.950 --> 01:27:01.785
explored.
experimented with.

1789
01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:04.887
You know. if we were
just open to the idea

1790
01:27:04.922 --> 01:27:07.428
of incorporating
science into the mix.

1791
01:27:07.463 --> 01:27:09.793
I think one of the nice things
about the Mississippi house

1792
01:27:09.828 --> 01:27:12.664
of Alice's house is
it allows for that to happen.

1793
01:27:13.095 --> 01:27:15.403
Because it's been
documented long enough

1794
01:27:15.438 --> 01:27:18.307
where it's not just
some crazy story.

1795
01:27:18.342 --> 01:27:20.507
I think that's the--
the nice thing about it.

1796
01:27:29.551 --> 01:27:30.616

is to facilitate a process

1803
01:27:46.898 --> 01:27:48.931

to feel that sense of ease

1805
01:27:50.704 --> 01:27:54.541

possession of her own home.

rhythmic breaths
in through the nose

when you awoke

1820
01:28:32.515 --> 01:28:35.714

a very specific light.

With a flash
in an instant.

totally unexpected.

in the room was black.

01:29:00.136 --> 01:29:01.674
And what is its purpose?

1830
01:29:06.516 --> 01:29:08.747
That-- I just
happened to be there.

1831
01:29:08.782 --> 01:29:11.684
I don't think it--
its intent was to appear to me.

Not that
the light's conscious

they're intently interested in.

01:32:02.318 --> 01:32:03.691
It would be awesome

live here full time.

01:32:08.027 --> 01:32:10.665
Obviously. she won't even
sleep here alone at night.

1892
01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:12.931
But I want to take it
in steps. if I can.

1893
01:32:12.966 --> 01:32:15.670
If we can get her
in the house for a night

1894
01:32:15.705 --> 01:32:17.232
and then
maybe that one night

1895
01:32:17.267 --> 01:32:18.805
will turn
into a few nights.

1896
01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:21.071
And maybe the few nights
will turn into a week.

1897
01:32:21.106 --> 01:32:22.369
That week
becomes a month

1898
01:32:22.404 --> 01:32:24.646
and now
she's in the house full time.

1899
01:32:24.681 --> 01:32:26.340
Tonight. anyway.

1900
01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:29.651
I wanted
to get your feeling...

1901
01:32:30.412 --> 01:32:33.215
uh. on-- on. uh--
on the house

1902
01:32:33.250 --> 01:32:35.382
and on
where we're sort of at.

1903
01:32:35.417 --> 01:32:37.351
Well.
we spoke to the team

1904
01:32:37.386 --> 01:32:40.189
and they're.
you know. on standby

1905
01:32:40.224 --> 01:32:42.290
in case
you're okay with this.

1906
01:32:42.325 --> 01:32:45.293
But we are wondering
if maybe tonight

1907
01:32:45.328 --> 01:32:46.833
might be
a night you might be

1908
01:32:46.868 --> 01:32:48.868
willing to sleep
in the house.

1909
01:32:48.903 --> 01:32:51.332
You know. I've actually
been thinking about that

1910
01:32:51.367 --> 01:32:53.169
since the hypnosis

1911
01:32:53.204 --> 01:32:54.973
because for some reason.

1912
01:32:55.008 --> 01:32:56.843
you know.
it wasn't what I expected.

1913
01:32:56.878 --> 01:32:59.340
I expected that I would
have to relive that experience

1914
01:32:59.375 --> 01:33:01.276
but it wasn't that at all.

1915
01:33:01.311 --> 01:33:03.377
You know.
it was actually

1916
01:33:03.412 --> 01:33:05.687
getting out
of that experience.

1917
01:33:05.722 --> 01:33:09.152
And so I feel like
I can watch it

1918
01:33:09.187 --> 01:33:10.384
from a distance.

1919
01:33:10.419 --> 01:33:11.924
-That's interesting.
-Yeah.

1920
01:33:11.959 --> 01:33:13.695
You know.
I'll sleep with my flashlight

1921
01:33:13.730 --> 01:33:15.290
and. um. I'm good.

1922
01:33:15.325 --> 01:33:17.160
-I'll-- I'll try to do it.
-You're thinking--

1923
01:33:17.195 --> 01:33:18.392
-Uh-huh.
-Really?

1924
01:33:18.427 --> 01:33:19.734
I think that
she knows that this is

1925
01:33:19.769 --> 01:33:21.736
the first step for her

1926
01:33:21.771 --> 01:33:24.266
to be able
to live in the house

1927
01:33:24.301 --> 01:33:26.906
and be able
to be here full time.

1928
01:33:26.941 --> 01:33:28.809
I don't necessarily
think that. you know.

1929
01:33:28.844 --> 01:33:30.745
the activity
is going to fully stop.

1930
01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:33.407
And if we weren't
able to ever get her

1931
01:33:33.442 --> 01:33:35.013
back inside the house.

1932
01:33:35.048 --> 01:33:37.686
I wouldn't
consider that a failure.

1933
01:33:37.721 --> 01:33:39.149
She has
so much more confidence

1934
01:33:39.184 --> 01:33:41.822

that's a major stepping stone.

And that happened.
She spent a night here.

replacing it with courage
