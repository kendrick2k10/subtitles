Well. there are a lot of people

355
00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:39.671
who call themselves
nationalists.

356
00:30:39.737 --> 00:30:40.905
Okay. let's discuss it.

357
00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:42.473
We're living in the country

358
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.810
when they are poisoning
a politician and killing people.

359
00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:48.847
And. uh.
arresting people for nothing.

360
00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:53.418
Uh. so. of course.
I am totally fine

361
00:30:53.518 --> 00:30:58.189
to sit with a guy
whose. uh. whose rally

362
00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:02.827
looks kind of not
very good for me.

363
00:31:19.911 --> 00:31:22.247
Grozev: The Russian media
didn't find anything.

364
00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:24.949
and German investigators
didn't have the jurisdiction.

365
00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:27.518
So we realized. "There's nobody
who's actually going

366
00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:32.090
to actively investigate this
unless we jump into this."

368
00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:39.130
We knew that the poison
was Novichok

369
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.966
and Novichok. we had proven
in the previous investigation.

370
00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:44.469
is only manufactured
in this facility

371
00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:47.538
called the Signal Institute.

372
00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:49.908
The Signal Institute in Moscow

373
00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:52.877
works under the guise
of a R&D center

374
00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:58.650
that develops advanced forms
of sports. nutrition drinks.

375
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.451
That's the legend.

376
00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:02.320
Yet. they employ.
for this work.

377
00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.723
12 scientists whose only
experience and background

378
00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:09.327
is in chemical weapons.

379
00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:12.497
Our hypothesis --
this is the entity

380
00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:15.466
that actually provides
the poison for the killers

381
00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:20.104
who travel around the world
poisoning people with Novichok.

382
00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:23.174
So what we did is we bought from
the Russian black market

383
00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:26.611
the phone records for the head
of the Signal Institute.

384
00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:29.280
We looked at numbers
that only appear

385
00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:32.350
just before
the poisoning of Navalny.

386
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.686
and those were suspicious.

387
00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:37.088
But once we have
a suspicious number.

388
00:32:37.155 --> 00:32:38.756
you go through a number
of Russian apps

389
00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:41.693
that allow you to see
how that phone number is listed

390
00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:44.095
in other people's phonebooks.

391
00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:46.464
So. for example.
I put in my number

392
00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:49.600
and it will show up as Christo
the journalist from Bellingcat.

393
00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:52.870
because somebody would have put
my name into their phonebook

394
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:55.873
and that description would have
been shared into this app.

395
00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:57.275
First number I looked up.

396
00:32:57.342 --> 00:33:00.712
showed up as
"Alexey doctor from FSB."

397
00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:03.047
Well. that was interesting.
A doctor from FSB?

398
00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:04.782
Alexey?
But that was not enough.

399
00:33:04.849 --> 00:33:07.952
We couldn't place a real person
behind this name.

400
00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:10.655
Then. I would look up
if this number showed up

401
00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:14.125
in any car-registration
databases.

402
00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:18.563
And we found an actual
Alexey Alexandrov who owns a car

403
00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:22.333
and this number was listed
for contacting that person.

404
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.669
So. then you have a real person
with a birthday.

405
00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:26.537
Then. you look up
his passport file.

406
00:33:26.637 --> 00:33:28.406
you see his face.

407
00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:31.676
You repeat that many times with
the other suspicious numbers.

408
00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:34.912
and then you have a short list
of interesting people.

409
00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:37.181
And these became
our prime suspects.

410
00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:41.886
Now. we knew when Navalny
had traveled to Siberia.

411
00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:43.921
We had the actual
passenger manifests

412
00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:47.592
of six different flights
that had flown into Novosibirsk

413
00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:50.428
where Navalny flew from Moscow
on the day before.

414
00:33:50.528 --> 00:33:53.898
during. and after the day
on which he arrived there.

415
00:33:53.998 --> 00:33:56.768
So. we needed to see if any
of those suspicious people

416
00:33:56.868 --> 00:34:00.438
traveled to Siberia
at the time of the poisoning.

417
00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:02.273
and we found an overlap.

418
00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:08.112
We found a nest of wasps
we didn't know existed.

419
00:34:08.212 --> 00:34:12.516
It's a domestic assassination
machine on an industrial scale.

420
00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:15.553
I was absolutely shocked
that this was so fast

421
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.422
and the whole plot
disentangled so quickly.

422
00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:21.626
so I just reached out by Twitter
and said. "Alexei.

423
00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:24.629
I think we may have found
who poisoned you."

424
00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.768

of the hospital.

427
