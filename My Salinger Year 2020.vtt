3
00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.688
<i>I grew up in
a quiet suburban town.</i>

4
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.722
just north of New York.

5
00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:08.825
On special occasions. my dad
would take me into the city.

6
00:01:08.858 --> 00:01:11.828
and we would go and get dessert
at the Waldorf or the Plaza.

7
00:01:12.996 --> 00:01:15.266
I loved watching
the people around us.

8
00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.268
They seemed to have
interesting lives.

9
00:01:18.402 --> 00:01:19.903
I wanted to be one of them.

10
00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:21.938
I wanted to write novels

11
00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:24.741
and speak 5 languages
and travel.

12
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.912
I didn't want to be ordinary.

13
00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:32.617
I wanted to be
extraordinary.

14
00:01:35.418 --> 00:01:37.787
<i>Those memories came
storming back to me last year</i>

15
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.290
<i>when I came to visit
my best friend in New York.</i>

16
00:01:40.323 --> 00:01:42.792
<i>I was only supposed to
stay a few days.</i>

17
00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:44.762
<i>and then return to Berkeley.</i>

18
00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:47.799
<i>where my boyfriend
was waiting on me.</i>

19
00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:52.603
But something shifted.

20
00:01:52.635 --> 00:01:54.338
I want to stay in New York
for a while.

21
00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.507
<i>A while?
What do you mean. a while?</i>

22
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.742
<i>What about your semester?</i>

23
00:01:58.775 --> 00:01:59.976
Yeah. but see.
that's just it.

24
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.679
I don't want to analyze other
people's work anymore. Karl.

25
00:02:02.712 --> 00:02:03.847
I want to write.

26
00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:05.283
<i>In New York?</i>

27
00:02:05.316 --> 00:02:06.417
Yeah.

28
00:02:08.718 --> 00:02:09.820
<i>In New York...</i>

29
00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:14.057
Isn't that what
aspiring writers did?

30
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:17.028
Live in cheap apartments
and write in cafés?

31
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:19.864
Yeah. I know.

32
00:02:19.896 --> 00:02:21.564
But it's what I wanted!

33
00:02:55.765 --> 00:02:58.401
My boss says
we're going paperless.

34
00:02:58.435 --> 00:02:59.937
- All emails.
- Hmm.

35
00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.574
It's driving me nuts. with
everyone writing about nothing.

36
00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:06.811
answering. "Thanks."
or worse. "You're welcome."

37
00:03:06.843 --> 00:03:10.548
My colleague sends me emails
to ask me when I'm having lunch.

38
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.417
I hope this is just a trend
that will phase out.

39
00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:15.018
I miss your rants.

40
00:03:16.387 --> 00:03:18.355
Everyone in Berkeley
is so serious

41
00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.558
and into jogging
and wearing Tevas.

42
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:22.659
Fucking Tevas!

43
00:03:22.693 --> 00:03:25.529
I'm like this big cloud
of East Coast irony

44
00:03:25.562 --> 00:03:27.031
haunting Southern California.

45
00:03:27.063 --> 00:03:29.099
Hmm. turning
everything into ash.

46
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:32.737
- That's me.
- Mmm!

47
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.739
Does Karl feel the same?

48
00:03:37.941 --> 00:03:40.076
Um. it's not really
the same for him.

49
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.980
'cause he's been there
for a couple years.

50
00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:45.950
and the university sort of
treats him like a star.

51
00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:47.985
Oh. well...

52
00:03:48.018 --> 00:03:49.820
Hey. Jenny. um...

53
00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:52.723
I don't know
exactly how long

54
00:03:52.756 --> 00:03:54.859
I'm gonna be staying
in New York.

55
00:03:54.891 --> 00:03:58.596
Don't worry! Just keep
making yourself at home.

56
00:03:58.628 --> 00:03:59.930
Eat anything.

57
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:03.100
OK.

58
00:04:11.508 --> 00:04:15.546
MA in English literature.
University College in London.

59
00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.048
I suppose that would
make you more appealing

60
00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:19.450
to some publishers.

61
00:04:19.483 --> 00:04:20.951
less to most.

62
00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:25.489
You published poetry?

63
00:04:25.521 --> 00:04:28.024
Yes. yes.
in <i>The Paris Review.</i>

64
00:04:28.057 --> 00:04:30.093
I just won
their student contest.

65
00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:31.629
Leave that out.

66
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:33.430
Publishers avoid
wannabe writers.

67
00:04:33.463 --> 00:04:37.468
Oh. That is what I
wa-want to do. though.

68
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.068
Event-eventually.

69
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:42.739
Oh! I got it!
Not a publisher.

70
00:04:42.773 --> 00:04:46.177
How about a literary agency?

71
00:04:47.478 --> 00:04:48.913
Yeah. great!

72
00:04:48.946 --> 00:04:50.548
The oldest in New York.

73
00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:51.782
Do you type?

74
00:04:51.814 --> 00:04:54.050
Uh. I took typing
in. um. 7th grade.

75
00:04:54.084 --> 00:04:55.819
Of course you don't type.

76
00:04:55.853 --> 00:04:57.989
She's gonna ask if you type.
and you're gonna say...

77
00:04:59.857 --> 00:05:00.825
Yes!

78
00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:04.194
Sixty words a minute.

79
00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:13.838
But do you type
on a typewriter?

80
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.073
It's very different from typing
on one of those computers.

81
00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:19.710
Yes.

82
00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:22.814
What do you like to read?

83
00:05:26.884 --> 00:05:27.951
Everything.

84
00:05:29.086 --> 00:05:31.822
Uh. Lurie. Hammet.
Donald Westlake.

85
00:05:31.855 --> 00:05:33.724
Hmm...

86
00:05:33.757 --> 00:05:35.692
I just finished
<i>A Sentimental Education.</i>

87
00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:36.593
and I loved it.

88
00:05:36.627 --> 00:05:38.662
It was so contemporary.
I was amazed.

89
00:05:38.694 --> 00:05:39.730
Gustave Flaubert...

90
00:05:39.762 --> 00:05:41.030
<i>Oui. c'est très bien.
ma chère.</i>

91
00:05:41.064 --> 00:05:42.266
but to be in this field.

92
00:05:42.298 --> 00:05:44.767
you'll need to read
authors who are alive.

93
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.637
Mmm...
I love Flaubert!

94
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.475
I like Westlake. He's funny.

95
00:05:53.142 --> 00:05:55.645
I guess you can
start after Christmas.

96
00:05:55.678 --> 00:05:57.080
We'll talk
about Jerry then.

97
00:05:57.113 --> 00:05:58.983
Ah. Jerry!

98
00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:01.752
I'm sure you've heard
that he's crazy or senile

99
00:06:01.785 --> 00:06:02.887
or a misanthrope.

100
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.021
All lies.
He's not the problem.

101
00:06:05.055 --> 00:06:07.257
It's these people
who relentlessly call

102
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.526
for his address.
his phone number.

103
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.930
asking to be put in touch
with him. or even with me!

104
00:06:13.963 --> 00:06:17.800
Reporters. students.
university deans. producers.

105
00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:20.204
They can be persuasive.
manipulative.

106
00:06:20.237 --> 00:06:24.241
But. you must
never. ever

107
00:06:24.274 --> 00:06:26.744
give out his address.

108
00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:28.878
Do you understand?

109
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:30.281
I understand.

110
00:06:30.314 --> 00:06:32.049
Good.

111
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:35.319
Remember. there's no shortage
of college graduates

112
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:37.854
who want this job.

113
00:06:39.322 --> 00:06:41.591
Be prepared
for long hours.

114
00:06:42.692 --> 00:06:43.760
Pam will give you a key.

115
00:06:44.827 --> 00:06:46.763
Pam. OK.

116
00:06:46.797 --> 00:06:47.998
Thank you so much.

117
00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:50.800
I can't tell you how
honored and thrilled I am.

118
00:06:50.834 --> 00:06:52.269
No need to
be honored.

119
00:06:52.302 --> 00:06:55.873
Thrilled. maybe.
Margaret is pretty thrilling.

120
00:06:59.041 --> 00:07:01.210
I'm Daniel. by the way.

121
00:07:08.384 --> 00:07:11.889
She'll be starting
after the holidays. January.

122
00:07:13.357 --> 00:07:15.059
That Jerry!

123
00:07:17.627 --> 00:07:19.596
Ah...

124
00:07:21.163 --> 00:07:24.134
<i>I didn't know yet
what a literary agency was.</i>

125
00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:27.670
<i>but felt like
I'd stepped closer</i>

126
00:07:27.704 --> 00:07:29.673
<i>to the world of writers.</i>

127
00:07:29.706 --> 00:07:34.711
<i>I was to be surrounded
by godlike literary names.</i>

128
00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:38.115
<i>No doubt. their proximity
would inspire my own writing.</i>

129
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.992
Well. congratulations
on your new job.

130
00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:51.127
Here is your key.

131
00:07:51.161 --> 00:07:53.062
Do not lose it.

132
00:07:53.096 --> 00:07:56.733
We will expect you at
8:00 a.m. sharp. January 8.

133
00:08:00.803 --> 00:08:02.705
<i>I never went
back to Berkeley.</i>

134
00:08:02.738 --> 00:08:05.209
<i>New York was to be my new home.
writing. my new life.</i>

135
00:08:05.242 --> 00:08:07.144
<i>with a coveted job
to pay the rent.</i>

136
00:08:07.177 --> 00:08:09.278
- Hi!
- Hey!

137
00:08:09.312 --> 00:08:12.682
Um... Hey!
Come. come. come join us.

138
00:08:12.716 --> 00:08:14.050
- Hi!
- Hi. hi. Mark.

139
00:08:14.084 --> 00:08:16.286
- Everyone. this is Joanna.
- I'm Joanna. Yeah. hi!

140
00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:18.021
And this is Mark.
This is Lisa.

141
00:08:18.055 --> 00:08:19.956
They. uh.
they just got engaged

142
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.257
so. uh. we're celebrating.

143
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.392
Oh. wow!
Oh my goodness!

144
00:08:22.425 --> 00:08:23.394
Congratulations!

145
00:08:23.427 --> 00:08:24.927
It's fake.

146
00:08:24.961 --> 00:08:27.031
Sit... sit... sit down.

147
00:08:27.064 --> 00:08:29.233
The office is incredible.

148
00:08:29.266 --> 00:08:32.302
It's like nothing's
changed since 1927.

149
00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:35.839
And. um. guess who
my boss represents.

150
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:37.073
- Anne Rice?
- The Pope.

151
00:08:37.106 --> 00:08:40.043
- Thomas Pynchon.
- J.D. Salinger.

152
00:08:40.076 --> 00:08:41.345
- No way!
- He's still alive?

153
00:08:41.378 --> 00:08:42.546
Yeah. he is.

154
00:08:42.578 --> 00:08:45.915
He lives up in New Hampshire.
in basically total isolation.

155
00:08:45.948 --> 00:08:48.751
Reporters are always trying to
ambush him in the local diner

156
00:08:48.784 --> 00:08:50.120
or try to sneak
onto his property.

157
00:08:50.153 --> 00:08:51.388
I love <i>Catcher in the Rye.</i>

158
00:08:51.421 --> 00:08:53.057
<i>Franny and Zooey</i>
is my favorite.

159
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.859
My friend Kat used to
work at his publisher's.

160
00:08:55.892 --> 00:08:57.695
And. one night.
she was working late.

161
00:08:57.727 --> 00:08:59.228
like. 1:00 a.m. late.

162
00:08:59.261 --> 00:09:02.165
and the phone rings in
the office and keeps ringing.

163
00:09:02.198 --> 00:09:03.900
So she picks it up.

164
00:09:03.933 --> 00:09:05.702
and she heard
someone screaming.

165
00:09:05.735 --> 00:09:07.804
The manuscript is OK!

166
00:09:07.837 --> 00:09:11.974
I saved the manuscript
from the fire!

167
00:09:12.008 --> 00:09:13.043
Salinger?

168
00:09:13.076 --> 00:09:15.079
His house had burned down.

169
00:09:15.111 --> 00:09:17.180
and he called in
the middle of the night.

170
00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:19.183
assuming someone
would be at the office.

171
00:09:19.216 --> 00:09:20.317
Isn't that crazy?

172
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.052
I read he still writes.
but doesn't want to publish.

173
00:09:23.086 --> 00:09:24.822
Writing makes you a writer.

174
00:09:24.855 --> 00:09:26.090
Publishing is commerce.

175
00:09:26.123 --> 00:09:28.358
That is such a
crock of shit. Don!

176
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.993
This is some pre-emptive
strike argument

177
00:09:31.027 --> 00:09:32.329
in case he never
sells a novel.

178
00:09:32.361 --> 00:09:33.463
if you ever finish.

179
00:09:33.496 --> 00:09:36.099
I will. but today
is about Joanna

180
00:09:36.133 --> 00:09:37.868
and her crossing
to the dark side

181
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.001
with the book merchants.

182
00:09:39.034 --> 00:09:40.937
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

183
00:09:40.971 --> 00:09:42.371
Thanks!

184
00:09:42.404 --> 00:09:43.639
<i>I had met Don days earlier</i>

185
00:09:43.673 --> 00:09:46.744
<i>in a socialist bookstore
where he worked part time.</i>

186
00:09:48.845 --> 00:09:51.014
Haven't seen you
around here before.

187
00:09:51.047 --> 00:09:51.915
Let me guess.

188
00:09:51.947 --> 00:09:54.951
You're an intern
at <i>The New Yorker?</i>

189
00:09:54.985 --> 00:09:58.288
<i>Besides fighting materialism
and raising class awareness.</i>

190
00:09:58.321 --> 00:10:01.492
<i>Don was into boxing.
Norman Mailer and...</i>

191
00:10:01.524 --> 00:10:02.692
Yeah. I'm writing a novel.

192
00:10:02.725 --> 00:10:05.495
<i>He was straightforward
about being a writer.</i>

193
00:10:05.528 --> 00:10:07.063
<i>I admired his confidence.</i>

194
00:10:07.096 --> 00:10:09.932
Do you know the Panama Café?

195
00:10:09.966 --> 00:10:12.536
It's on Avenue A. It's kind of
like a writers' hangout.

196
00:10:12.568 --> 00:10:14.237
I do. actually.
yeah. they have...

197
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.905
Poetry readings.

198
00:10:17.506 --> 00:10:19.976
Love is the one
who's hard to find.

199
00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:22.245
Love's the one
who knows your mind.

200
00:10:22.278 --> 00:10:24.380
Love's the one
who feeds your soul.

201
00:10:24.413 --> 00:10:27.951
Love's the one
to have and hold.

202
00:10:27.984 --> 00:10:29.987
But hold a minute. Hold how?

203
00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:33.890
There's a hundred hungry ways
to hold her up or hold her down.

204
00:10:33.923 --> 00:10:35.858
Will she still be able
to get around?

205
00:10:35.892 --> 00:10:39.062
Will she be able
to hold her ground?

206
00:10:39.095 --> 00:10:42.266
So she digs down deep
to the bottom of the box

207
00:10:42.298 --> 00:10:44.534
to find the original
hide of the fox.

208
00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:46.336
And it's there. all right.

209
00:10:46.369 --> 00:10:48.205
Where the hell
were you?

210
00:10:48.238 --> 00:10:49.907
Cut the goddamn grass today.

211
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.243
or else I'm selling
your K-car. you hear?

212
00:11:01.851 --> 00:11:04.086
<i>Dear Mr. Salinger.</i>

213
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.222
<i>I read your book</i>
The Catcher In the Rye

214
00:11:06.255 --> 00:11:07.524
<i>3 times now.</i>

215
00:11:07.557 --> 00:11:10.427
<i>It's a masterpiece.
and I hope you're proud of it.</i>

216
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.229
<i>I mean. you certainly
should be.</i>

217
00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:15.999
<i>Most of the crap
that's written today</i>

218
00:11:16.032 --> 00:11:18.235
<i>is so uncompelling.
it makes me sick.</i>

219
00:11:18.268 --> 00:11:20.170
<i>I mean. not too many people
write anything</i>

220
00:11:20.202 --> 00:11:21.538
<i>that even approaches sincerity.</i>

221
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:22.672
<i>And I don't mean to say</i>

222
00:11:22.706 --> 00:11:24.975
<i>that everyone who reads
your book gets it.</i>

223
00:11:25.008 --> 00:11:26.276
<i>not at all.</i>

224
00:11:26.308 --> 00:11:27.911
<i>Lots of people don't.</i>

225
00:11:29.178 --> 00:11:31.447
I mean. I can give you
plenty of idiotic examples.

226
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.415
but I won't.

227
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.620
You might be laughing out loud
right now at the thought.

228
00:11:37.653 --> 00:11:40.356
<i>but I think I get it.</i>

229
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:42.025
<i>Maybe I don't.</i>

230
00:11:46.196 --> 00:11:47.498
Hello!

231
00:12:04.214 --> 00:12:06.583
Well. you're here.

232
00:12:06.615 --> 00:12:07.583
I am!

233
00:12:09.085 --> 00:12:10.954
We know you can type. hooray!

234
00:12:10.986 --> 00:12:13.557
But have you ever
used a dictaphone?

235
00:12:14.658 --> 00:12:16.026
At ease.

236
00:12:17.159 --> 00:12:18.461
It can be tricky at first.

237
00:12:18.495 --> 00:12:20.230
but I'm sure you'll
get the hang of it.

238
00:12:22.097 --> 00:12:26.002
Play. rewind. and I think
those control speed.

239
00:12:26.035 --> 00:12:27.336
Hugh can help.

240
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.404
Hugh...

241
00:12:28.437 --> 00:12:30.139
You can get
started with these.

242
00:12:33.375 --> 00:12:36.245
This is our technological area.

243
00:12:36.278 --> 00:12:38.282
It is all very new.

244
00:12:38.315 --> 00:12:40.317
This is the Xerox
machine you'll use

245
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.451
to make copies
of my correspondence.

246
00:12:42.485 --> 00:12:46.156
I believe that is the button
you press to make a copy.

247
00:12:46.188 --> 00:12:47.557
Did she give you her speech

248
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.493
about the evils
of the digital age yet?

249
00:12:49.525 --> 00:12:51.661
Max. this is Joanna.
my new assistant.

250
00:12:51.695 --> 00:12:53.163
- Hello. Joanna!
- Max.

251
00:12:53.196 --> 00:12:54.598
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

252
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.132
Um...

253
00:12:57.267 --> 00:12:59.069
So. there are no computers?

254
00:12:59.101 --> 00:13:01.270
We choose not
to use computers.

255
00:13:01.303 --> 00:13:03.072
I've seen them in action.

256
00:13:03.105 --> 00:13:06.176
They just make more work
for everyone. wasting time.

257
00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:08.411
All right.

258
00:13:08.445 --> 00:13:12.983
As you can see. we have a
relaxed. cordial environment.

259
00:13:13.015 --> 00:13:15.952
We ask that you don't
wear dungarees. sneakers.

260
00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:18.989
T-shirts. sweatshirts.
especially the kind with hoods.

261
00:13:19.022 --> 00:13:20.257
No open-toed shoes.

262
00:13:20.289 --> 00:13:23.626
but it's perfectly fine to wear
trousers if you're a woman.

263
00:13:23.659 --> 00:13:26.129
and no need to wear
stockings in the summer.

264
00:13:26.162 --> 00:13:28.298
Bare legs are perfectly fine.

265
00:13:28.331 --> 00:13:30.567
And if Jerry calls.
you just say:

266
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.235
"Yes. Jerry. I will
let my boss know."

267
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:35.072
Jerry Salinger?

268
00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:36.706
Well. of course.
Jerry Salinger.

269
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.342
And above all.
you never. ever call him.

270
00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:42.411
Why would I
call Jerry Salinger?

271
00:13:42.445 --> 00:13:44.480
Jerry doesn't
want to hear about

272
00:13:44.514 --> 00:13:46.549
how much you loved
<i>The Catcher in the Rye.</i>

273
00:13:46.582 --> 00:13:49.352
And he doesn't want
to read your stories.

274
00:13:49.385 --> 00:13:51.187
- I don't have stories.
- Good.

275
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:53.557
Writers make
the worst assistants.

276
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.426
Get to work.

277
00:14:09.672 --> 00:14:12.075
<i>The proprietor hereby grants</i>

278
00:14:12.107 --> 00:14:13.242
<i>to the publisher...</i>

279
00:14:14.476 --> 00:14:17.146
<i>...starting from the date
of this agreement.</i>

280
00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:19.081
<i>The proprietor...</i>

281
00:14:19.115 --> 00:14:21.551
I'm Hugh.
You must be Joanna.

282
00:14:21.583 --> 00:14:23.352
Yes. hi!
Nice to meet you.

283
00:14:23.385 --> 00:14:25.554
If you need anything.
I'm right here.

284
00:14:25.587 --> 00:14:30.293
I take care of contracts. legal.
copyrights. the fun stuff.

285
00:14:31.461 --> 00:14:34.563
Salinger's letters. fan mail.

286
00:14:34.596 --> 00:14:39.602
You need to answer
them using these.

287
00:14:39.635 --> 00:14:41.771
There's one for
each type of inquiry:

288
00:14:41.804 --> 00:14:44.407
adaptation. autobiography.

289
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:47.244
autograph.
photograph. interview...

290
00:14:49.278 --> 00:14:51.514
celebrity auction.

291
00:14:53.149 --> 00:14:55.619
"Mr. Salinger does not wish to
receive mail from his readers.

292
00:14:55.652 --> 00:14:58.121
Thus we cannot pass
your kind note on to him."

293
00:14:58.153 --> 00:14:59.789
1963?

294
00:14:59.822 --> 00:15:02.759
That's the year he
stopped responding himself.

295
00:15:02.792 --> 00:15:06.129
You need to type the new one
based exactly on this. verbatim.

296
00:15:06.162 --> 00:15:07.631
No change.

297
00:15:07.663 --> 00:15:10.232
So. Salinger doesn't
get any of his mail?

298
00:15:10.265 --> 00:15:14.103
Not one. you shred them
in the shredder.

299
00:15:14.136 --> 00:15:15.471
You should always read them.

300
00:15:15.504 --> 00:15:16.840
Yes. indeed.

301
00:15:16.873 --> 00:15:19.142
- Just in case.
- Just in case.

302
00:15:19.174 --> 00:15:20.709
In case of what?

303
00:15:20.743 --> 00:15:24.548
We've been extra careful since
the Marc David Chapman thing.

304
00:15:24.581 --> 00:15:26.750
John Lennon's assassin.

305
00:15:26.783 --> 00:15:28.818
When the police arrived
at the Dakota.

306
00:15:28.851 --> 00:15:31.087
<i>they found Chapman calmly
sitting on the sidewalk</i>

307
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.489
<i>reading</i> Catcher in the Rye.

308
00:15:32.522 --> 00:15:34.758
At his trial.

309
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:37.627
Chapman said that the big part
of him was Holden Caulfield.

310
00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:39.562
And the small
part of him was...

311
00:15:42.565 --> 00:15:44.100
the devil.

312
00:15:49.438 --> 00:15:52.375
Did Chapman write to Salinger?

313
00:15:52.408 --> 00:15:55.778
We'll never know.
since we throw away the mail.

314
00:15:55.812 --> 00:15:59.249
Read everything
thoroughly.

315
00:15:59.282 --> 00:16:00.817
Use your judgment.

316
00:16:28.677 --> 00:16:30.480
I think about Holden a lot.

317
00:16:31.614 --> 00:16:33.149
When I first think about him.

318
00:16:33.182 --> 00:16:35.152
I get a stupid grin
on my face. you know...

319
00:16:36.351 --> 00:16:38.488
thinking about what
a funny guy he is and all.

320
00:16:40.222 --> 00:16:42.525
But then I usually get
depressed as hell...

321
00:16:43.659 --> 00:16:45.327
'cause I only
think about Holden

322
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.864
when I'm feeling
very emotional. and...

323
00:16:48.364 --> 00:16:50.300
I can get quite emotional.

324
00:16:52.869 --> 00:16:55.238
"I can get quite emotional."

325
00:16:57.673 --> 00:16:59.175
This boy is so earnest.

326
00:17:00.342 --> 00:17:02.445
A major loser
is what he is.

327
00:17:03.546 --> 00:17:04.648
Hey! He is not!

328
00:17:04.681 --> 00:17:05.682
He is.

329
00:17:05.714 --> 00:17:07.384
He's very sweet.

330
00:17:07.416 --> 00:17:08.918
He's a little funny.

331
00:17:08.951 --> 00:17:11.253
but he's sweet
and he cares so much.

332
00:17:11.287 --> 00:17:13.190
I can't send him
a letter that says:

333
00:17:13.222 --> 00:17:15.558
"Dear kid. Mr. Salinger
has no interest in you.

334
00:17:15.592 --> 00:17:16.793
so please fuck off!"

335
00:17:17.794 --> 00:17:19.930
Look. this one is
from the Netherlands:

336
00:17:19.962 --> 00:17:23.200
"Me and my wife traced Holden's
steps around New York.

337
00:17:23.232 --> 00:17:24.900
"Did you know that
the ducks in Central Park

338
00:17:24.933 --> 00:17:26.502
stay through winter?"

339
00:17:26.536 --> 00:17:29.806
Oh my God. they're literally
a bunch of obsessive freaks!

340
00:17:35.612 --> 00:17:38.315
I haven't read
<i>Catcher in the Rye.</i>

341
00:17:38.347 --> 00:17:39.649
You're kidding.

342
00:17:40.817 --> 00:17:42.853
I haven't read any Salinger.

343
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.522
Wow!

344
00:17:46.556 --> 00:17:48.924
Everybody's read <i>Catcher</i>
at the very least.

345
00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.528
Yeah. well. at the risk
of disappointing you.

346
00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.730
there are actually a few writers
that I have yet to read.

347
00:17:54.763 --> 00:17:56.567
Well. I'm shocked.

348
00:17:57.866 --> 00:17:59.970
Hey. look. this girl is ready
to go to bed with him.

349
00:18:01.003 --> 00:18:01.971
He's 70-something.

350
00:18:02.005 --> 00:18:03.506
Don't be naive!

351
00:18:03.538 --> 00:18:06.475
Good literature is
a powerful aphrodisiac.

352
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:11.948
<i>I never had that
teenage Salinger moment.</i>

353
00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.350
<i>We never read</i>
Catcher in the Rye <i>at school.</i>

354
00:18:14.384 --> 00:18:16.987
<i>and later. I was interested
in difficult. gritty fiction.</i>

355
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:20.022
Hey. hon!

356
00:18:20.056 --> 00:18:23.026
Uh. Jenny's not
here right now.

357
00:18:23.058 --> 00:18:25.394
Oh! I'll be in the kitchen.

358
00:18:25.428 --> 00:18:27.998
<i>I imagined Salinger's books</i>

359
00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.969
<i>to be insufferably cute.
quirky and precious.</i>

360
00:18:33.001 --> 00:18:34.703
<i>I didn't want
to be entertained.</i>

361
00:18:34.737 --> 00:18:36.573
<i>I wanted to be provoked.</i>

362
00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.995
Every morning!

363
00:18:59.028 --> 00:19:02.432
My shoulder hurts from
carrying all those manuscripts.

364
00:19:02.464 --> 00:19:04.268
- Hey. Joanna!
- Hi!

365
00:19:05.734 --> 00:19:08.570
Oh! I found a writer for
Max out of the slush pile.

366
00:19:08.604 --> 00:19:09.672
The stories are so good.

367
00:19:09.704 --> 00:19:12.608
I read them last night.
and I was sobbing by the end.

368
00:19:17.713 --> 00:19:19.581
What's the slush pile?

369
00:19:19.615 --> 00:19:21.518
The slush pile?

370
00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.052
OK. it's like
the most amazing

371
00:19:23.086 --> 00:19:24.820
and most horrible
part of our job.

372
00:19:24.854 --> 00:19:27.457
The stacks of manuscripts
nobody wants to read.

373
00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.793
Basically. it's all the
unsolicited query letters.

374
00:19:29.826 --> 00:19:31.961
people with no referral
who write to agents cold.

375
00:19:31.993 --> 00:19:34.798
The slush pile is.
like. 99% crazy shit.

376
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.533
though some of it
is seriously hilarious.

377
00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:41.104
But very. very occasionally.
you find something amazing.

378
00:19:43.439 --> 00:19:46.109
Your boss doesn't
let you read?

379
00:19:46.142 --> 00:19:47.911
I can read manuscripts.

380
00:19:47.943 --> 00:19:49.913
should that be something
that interests you.

381
00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:51.847
at home on my free time.
of course!

382
00:19:51.881 --> 00:19:53.717
Manuscripts?

383
00:19:56.051 --> 00:19:57.520
No.

384
00:20:00.423 --> 00:20:02.358
Tabs. wrong.

385
00:20:02.392 --> 00:20:03.625
Margins. wrong.

386
00:20:03.659 --> 00:20:05.428
Proper names. wrong.

387
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:06.796
Really. everything wrong.

388
00:20:06.828 --> 00:20:09.798
You can start re-typing today.

389
00:20:09.832 --> 00:20:13.603
And here. as a bonus.
is today's dictation.

390
00:20:14.936 --> 00:20:15.971
That...

391
00:20:16.005 --> 00:20:17.607
Forget about manuscripts.

392
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.676
You need to get that right.

393
00:20:23.746 --> 00:20:25.415
Is it on?

394
00:20:25.448 --> 00:20:26.750
Uh. no.

395
00:20:28.017 --> 00:20:31.621
As you know. I believe
that computers make work

396
00:20:31.653 --> 00:20:33.556
rather than alleviate it.

397
00:20:33.588 --> 00:20:36.393
but I agreed to install one
in the office.

398
00:20:36.425 --> 00:20:38.060
on a trial basis. because...

399
00:20:38.094 --> 00:20:40.063
It came in an elegant black.

400
00:20:40.096 --> 00:20:43.900
Because Hugh discovered
that people...

401
00:20:43.932 --> 00:20:45.468
I don't know
who these people are

402
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.069
or why they don't have
more important things

403
00:20:47.103 --> 00:20:48.872
to do with their lives...

404
00:20:48.904 --> 00:20:51.974
but people have been publishing
whole Salinger stories

405
00:20:52.008 --> 00:20:54.978
on their personal e-webs.

406
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.112
Web logs.

407
00:20:57.212 --> 00:20:58.815
Web logs...
Ridiculous!

408
00:20:58.847 --> 00:21:01.651
This is blatant
copyright infringement.

409
00:21:01.683 --> 00:21:04.753
and we're going to have to
scour the World Wide Web

410
00:21:04.787 --> 00:21:06.088
to put an end to it.

411
00:21:06.122 --> 00:21:09.793
And that is all the computer
is to be used for.

412
00:21:09.826 --> 00:21:13.129
Sorry to interrupt.
Just passing through.

413
00:21:13.162 --> 00:21:15.465
Don't mean to cause a fuss.

414
00:21:18.768 --> 00:21:20.603
We can turn it off now.

415
00:21:20.635 --> 00:21:22.806
- Uh. it's already off.
- OK. good.

416
00:21:22.838 --> 00:21:24.807
And maybe the little coat
that goes over it.

417
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.675
I've seen it in pictures.
Thank you. Max.

418
00:21:26.709 --> 00:21:28.044
I'm afraid we don't have a...

419
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.884
<i>There were hundreds of us.
thousands maybe. all girls.</i>

420
00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:39.521
<i>working at literary agencies
or publishing houses.</i>

421
00:21:39.555 --> 00:21:41.691
<i>We answered calls
for our bosses.</i>

422
00:21:41.723 --> 00:21:44.927
<i>ushered in the writers.
fetched them water...</i>

423
00:21:44.961 --> 00:21:48.897
<i>never belying the fact that we
wanted to be writers ourselves.</i>

424
00:21:48.931 --> 00:21:51.034
<i>We whispered about
the lucky ones.</i>

425
00:21:51.067 --> 00:21:53.870
<i>the ones who were
mentored by their bosses.</i>

426
00:21:53.903 --> 00:21:57.039
<i>who were allowed
to take on books or clients.</i>

427
00:21:57.073 --> 00:22:00.109
<i>the ones who broke the rules
to show initiative...</i>

428
00:22:02.778 --> 00:22:05.515
<i>...the ones who wanted it
badly enough.</i>

429
00:22:05.548 --> 00:22:07.951
<i>Please find two copies</i>

430
00:22:07.983 --> 00:22:10.186
<i>of the contract with
St. Martin publishing.</i>

431
00:22:11.653 --> 00:22:15.057
<i>Let's face it.
I was a secretary.</i>

432
00:22:40.782 --> 00:22:42.584
Hello?

433
00:22:42.617 --> 00:22:44.153
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

434
00:22:44.185 --> 00:22:45.821
Hello?

435
00:22:45.855 --> 00:22:48.892
<i>Speaking to? It's Jerry.</i>

436
00:22:50.292 --> 00:22:51.994
Hello. Mr. Salinger!

437
00:22:52.028 --> 00:22:53.730
<i>Who is this?</i>

438
00:22:53.762 --> 00:22:55.531
This is Joanna.

439
00:22:55.565 --> 00:22:56.633
<i>Who?</i>

440
00:22:56.665 --> 00:22:57.833
I... I'm Joanna.

441
00:22:57.866 --> 00:22:59.769
I'm... I'm Margaret's
new assistant.

442
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:01.937
<i>Oh. Margaret's new assistant!</i>

443
00:23:01.971 --> 00:23:03.605
<i>Nice to meet you. Suzanna.</i>

444
00:23:03.638 --> 00:23:04.873
<i>How do you like your job?</i>

445
00:23:04.906 --> 00:23:06.141
I love it!

446
00:23:06.174 --> 00:23:09.611
<i>Good to hear. I'm calling
to speak to your boss.</i>

447
00:23:09.644 --> 00:23:11.647
Unfortunately.
she's not in right now.

448
00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:13.316
Um. can I leave her a message?

449
00:23:13.348 --> 00:23:15.751
<i>Oh. no. I'll call back.</i>

450
00:23:15.785 --> 00:23:17.620
<i>Well. I'm sure you
have a lot of work.</i>

451
00:23:17.653 --> 00:23:19.788
<i>It was very nice
talking to you. Suzanna.</i>

452
00:23:19.821 --> 00:23:22.291
<i>I'm looking forward
to meeting you in person.</i>

453
00:23:22.325 --> 00:23:23.894
You too.

454
00:23:24.961 --> 00:23:26.194
Have a great day!

455
00:23:26.228 --> 00:23:27.596
<i>Goodbye!</i>

456
00:23:33.102 --> 00:23:34.737
I never say:
"Have a great day."

457
00:23:34.769 --> 00:23:35.872
Jerry?

458
00:23:37.073 --> 00:23:39.342
He's deaf. An explosion
during the war.

459
00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:40.343
She just left?

460
00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:41.877
Yes.

461
00:23:41.911 --> 00:23:43.179
Better go tell her.

462
00:23:50.619 --> 00:23:51.887
Quicker.

463
00:23:55.891 --> 00:23:58.061
Margaret!

464
00:23:58.094 --> 00:24:00.028
Sorry! I'm sorry
to disturb you.

465
00:24:00.061 --> 00:24:01.997
You just got a call from...

466
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.832
Your client just called.

467
00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:06.702
I wonder
which one!

468
00:24:06.736 --> 00:24:08.605
I have to take this.

469
00:24:08.637 --> 00:24:11.673
Go ahead. Books. I'll wait
for you at the restaurant.

470
00:24:11.707 --> 00:24:13.977
You did the
right thing.

471
00:24:14.009 --> 00:24:16.278
Salinger wants to
publish a book.

472
00:24:19.315 --> 00:24:21.718
The press is
gonna go nuts.

473
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.019
No press. No one must know.

474
00:24:23.051 --> 00:24:24.219
That's our job.

475
00:24:24.252 --> 00:24:26.855
So it's true.
He's been writing.

476
00:24:26.888 --> 00:24:29.257
Well. no. it's an
old story. <i>Hapworth.</i>

477
00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.994
A publisher.
Clifford Bradbury.

478
00:24:32.028 --> 00:24:35.264
approached him to publish it
as a stand-alone book.

479
00:24:35.297 --> 00:24:38.634
He has been thinking
about it for 8 years.

480
00:24:38.667 --> 00:24:41.136
The publisher wrote
to him back in '88.

481
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.307
Jerry liked the fact that
he wrote on a typewriter.

482
00:24:44.339 --> 00:24:46.742
How did he get
Jerry's address?

483
00:24:46.776 --> 00:24:48.378
He addressed it
to J.D. Salinger.

484
00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:49.412
Cornish. New Hampshire.

485
00:24:49.444 --> 00:24:50.679
Postman delivered it!

486
00:24:51.747 --> 00:24:52.782
That's brilliant.

487
00:24:52.815 --> 00:24:55.183
Wait. wait. wait. Margaret.

488
00:24:55.217 --> 00:24:57.353
What kind of publisher is this?

489
00:24:57.385 --> 00:24:59.689
It can't be Little. Brown
or any major house.

490
00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:01.190
They would have
just called you.

491
00:25:01.222 --> 00:25:03.158
Oh boy! You're gonna
love this. Max.

492
00:25:03.192 --> 00:25:05.761
It is a tiny press
in Virginia.

493
00:25:05.795 --> 00:25:09.231
Kind of a one-man operation:
Merrygold Press.

494
00:25:09.265 --> 00:25:11.067
Merrybells Press?

495
00:25:11.099 --> 00:25:14.770
Yes. that's it.
You know them?

496
00:25:14.804 --> 00:25:17.673
They publish poetry.
and I like few of their poets.

497
00:25:19.375 --> 00:25:21.009
Are you fucking
kidding me?

498
00:25:21.042 --> 00:25:23.245
A one-man press
is going to publish

499
00:25:23.278 --> 00:25:24.946
the first book
from Salinger

500
00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.149
in 3 decades?

501
00:25:26.182 --> 00:25:27.950
That's fucked.

502
00:25:27.982 --> 00:25:29.851
Publishing Salinger
is different

503
00:25:29.884 --> 00:25:30.987
than publishing poetry.

504
00:25:31.019 --> 00:25:32.187
Thank you.

505
00:25:32.221 --> 00:25:34.723
Obviously. we have to
proceed carefully.

506
00:25:34.757 --> 00:25:38.461
Find out everything we can
about this Clifford Bradbury.

507
00:25:38.493 --> 00:25:39.761
I'll call him.

508
00:25:39.795 --> 00:25:41.197
I won't mention Salinger.

509
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.299
and I'll ask for his catalogue
and a sample for our records.

510
00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:46.736
Good thinking.

511
00:25:46.769 --> 00:25:50.039
Hugh. get me the contract
with <i>The New Yorker.</i> please.

512
00:25:53.843 --> 00:25:54.944
What's <i>Hapworth?</i>

513
00:25:56.811 --> 00:25:59.815
It was published in
<i>The New Yorker</i> in '65.

514
00:25:59.848 --> 00:26:01.317
Took up almost
the whole magazine.

515
00:26:01.349 --> 00:26:04.786
- Let me see.
- Pretty common in those days.

516
00:26:04.819 --> 00:26:07.789
<i>Esquire</i> did it. <i>Cosmo.</i>

517
00:26:07.823 --> 00:26:12.361
That's where I got my start.
Buying stories for a magazine.

518
00:26:12.394 --> 00:26:14.297
For <i>Cosmo?</i>

519
00:26:14.329 --> 00:26:16.365
For <i>Playboy.</i>

520
00:26:17.432 --> 00:26:20.103
How did you end up
working for <i>Playboy?</i>

521
00:26:20.135 --> 00:26:24.039
Enough chit-chat. Joanna.
Back to work.

522
00:26:24.073 --> 00:26:25.875
Hi! Is this Clifford Bradbury?

523
00:26:26.976 --> 00:26:28.845
Hi! This is Joanna Rakoff.

524
00:26:28.877 --> 00:26:31.146
I work for A & F
Literary Management.

525
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.381
<i>The job of an agent</i>

526
00:26:32.414 --> 00:26:35.817
<i>is to open up opportunities
for their clients.</i>

527
00:26:35.851 --> 00:26:40.223
<i>But when it came to Salinger.
the logic was reversed.</i>

528
00:26:40.256 --> 00:26:43.493
<i>We had to shield him
from the outside world.</i>

529
00:26:43.526 --> 00:26:46.895
<i>bolstering his reputation
as a complicated recluse.</i>

530
00:26:46.929 --> 00:26:48.096
Yeah. thank you.

531
00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:49.131
<i>But publishing</i> Hapworth

532
00:26:49.164 --> 00:26:51.800
<i>was going to get
a lot of attention.</i>

533
00:26:51.834 --> 00:26:54.303
<i>Nobody understood
his change of heart.</i>

534
00:26:54.336 --> 00:26:55.872
Night. Jerry.

535
00:26:55.904 --> 00:26:59.142
<i>Maybe. I thought. I understood.</i>

536
00:26:59.174 --> 00:27:02.144
<i>Maybe he realized that
what he wanted</i>

537
00:27:02.178 --> 00:27:03.847
<i>wasn't what he wanted at all.</i>

538
00:27:05.413 --> 00:27:07.349
I was like:
"Are you serious?"

539
00:27:07.383 --> 00:27:08.351
She was like:

540
00:27:08.384 --> 00:27:10.519
"Yeah. he's totally
visiting me in my dreams.

541
00:27:10.553 --> 00:27:11.754
I think he has a
message for me."

542
00:27:11.788 --> 00:27:14.923
And I looked to either side
of me to see if anyone heard.

543
00:27:54.028 --> 00:27:55.932
What are you writing?

544
00:27:57.031 --> 00:27:59.201
Writing a very bad poem.

545
00:28:04.205 --> 00:28:08.310
Listen. Bret and I
were talking. and...

546
00:28:10.511 --> 00:28:12.048
Look...

547
00:28:13.214 --> 00:28:15.417
When you first
got back to New York.

548
00:28:15.451 --> 00:28:18.086
and I said that
you could stay here.

549
00:28:18.119 --> 00:28:21.557
to be honest. I thought you'd
go back to Berkeley with Karl.

550
00:28:23.092 --> 00:28:24.259
You're kicking me out?

551
00:28:25.527 --> 00:28:27.496
No. like...

552
00:28:27.528 --> 00:28:32.234
I'm happy to have you here.
and you can stay if you want.

553
00:28:32.268 --> 00:28:34.403
but what did you
plan on doing?

554
00:28:34.435 --> 00:28:36.505
What are your options?

555
00:28:37.573 --> 00:28:40.977
Oh! Ah!

556
00:28:41.009 --> 00:28:44.079
We disinfected
the apartment.

557
00:28:45.213 --> 00:28:49.018
'Cause the man
before had 7 cats.

558
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.454
But young married
couple like you

559
00:28:52.488 --> 00:28:54.957
take better
care of it. yeah?

560
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.358
We're not married.

561
00:28:56.392 --> 00:28:58.193
The man next door.

562
00:28:58.227 --> 00:29:01.464
he takes care of
little things if you need.

563
00:29:01.497 --> 00:29:04.300
He's Mexican. He drinks.

564
00:29:05.401 --> 00:29:07.303
But he works hard.

565
00:29:07.336 --> 00:29:09.038
Uh. how much?

566
00:29:10.105 --> 00:29:11.473
$560.

567
00:29:11.507 --> 00:29:13.174
We'll think about it!

568
00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:15.311
No. we'll take it.

569
00:29:15.344 --> 00:29:17.947
Oh! Good deal!

570
00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.347
You're Jewish. yeah?

571
00:29:19.381 --> 00:29:20.650
- Me?
- Mmm?

572
00:29:20.682 --> 00:29:22.117
No.

573
00:29:22.151 --> 00:29:24.620
I like. very responsible.

574
00:29:24.653 --> 00:29:26.956
- Hmm.
- Pay on time.

575
00:29:26.989 --> 00:29:29.959
Uh. let's sign
the paper.

576
00:29:29.991 --> 00:29:31.961
The lease is gonna
be under her name.

577
00:29:31.993 --> 00:29:32.961
Hmm?

578
00:29:35.364 --> 00:29:38.000
Could have just given ourselves
a day to think about it.

579
00:29:38.032 --> 00:29:40.568
No. this is New York City.
young lady. the big time!

580
00:29:40.602 --> 00:29:42.438
I barely make $300 a week.

581
00:29:42.471 --> 00:29:44.472
No. wait. we split
the rent. Buba.

582
00:29:44.506 --> 00:29:45.975
I'm gonna pay my half.

583
00:29:46.008 --> 00:29:48.144
I just... I just have to
avoid the credit check.

584
00:29:49.478 --> 00:29:52.248
Look. I'll take care
of the furniture. all right?

585
00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.515
There's no sink.

586
00:29:54.583 --> 00:29:55.718
What?

587
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.353
There's no sink
in the kitchen.

588
00:29:57.385 --> 00:29:59.454
I knew something was
off about the apartment.

589
00:29:59.488 --> 00:30:00.957
<i>I couldn't
put my finger on it.</i>

590
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.091
<i>There's no kitchen sink.</i>

591
00:30:02.125 --> 00:30:04.693
We just signed a lease for
an apartment with no sink!

592
00:30:04.727 --> 00:30:06.963
Well. we can do the dishes
in the bathtub.

593
00:30:06.996 --> 00:30:07.964
It's no big deal.

594
00:30:07.997 --> 00:30:10.399
There's a tub. Trust me.

595
00:30:10.432 --> 00:30:12.000
Hey. man!
You coming?

596
00:30:14.135 --> 00:30:16.305
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

597
00:30:29.417 --> 00:30:33.088
Dear Mr. Salinger. please
forgive my bad English.

598
00:30:33.122 --> 00:30:34.390
I work much at night.

599
00:30:34.423 --> 00:30:38.060
and I like it because I don't
have to talk to people so much.

600
00:30:39.327 --> 00:30:41.696
My heart is troubled.
just like Holden Caulfield.

601
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:46.301
Holden is like my grandfather.
you know. a no-bullshit man.

602
00:30:47.469 --> 00:30:50.105
He taught me a lot
about human nature.

603
00:30:50.138 --> 00:30:53.274
He warned me I would be
disappointed by most people.

604
00:30:53.307 --> 00:30:54.676
We would be very honored

605
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.613
if you would serve as our
commencement reader next year.

606
00:30:57.645 --> 00:31:00.449
We would. of course.
provide you with accommodation

607
00:31:00.481 --> 00:31:01.583
in a very fine inn.

608
00:31:01.616 --> 00:31:04.686
where your privacy. which I
know is important to you.

609
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.155
would be scrupulously respected.

610
00:31:07.189 --> 00:31:09.025
<i>The fishing helps me.</i>

611
00:31:09.057 --> 00:31:11.160
A nice refuge
from my nightmares.

612
00:31:12.294 --> 00:31:14.497
It's been 27 years
since Vietnam.

613
00:31:16.097 --> 00:31:18.000
They just keep getting worse.

614
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.436
You know. seeing your
dead friends

615
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.273
having their guts ripped out...

616
00:31:24.306 --> 00:31:26.475
Well. I'm sure you must
have similar type dreams.

617
00:31:26.508 --> 00:31:27.809
being a veteran who...

618
00:31:27.843 --> 00:31:30.413
<i>"...does not wish to receive
mail from his readers.</i>

619
00:31:30.445 --> 00:31:33.348
<i>"Thus. we cannot pass along
your kind note to him.</i>

620
00:31:33.382 --> 00:31:36.485
<i>We thank you for your interest
in Mr. Salinger's book."</i>

621
00:31:36.518 --> 00:31:38.754
My daughter
died from leukemia.

622
00:31:38.787 --> 00:31:40.823
She was a talented young writer.

623
00:31:40.855 --> 00:31:44.160
I'm founding a small
literary magazine in her memory.

624
00:31:44.192 --> 00:31:46.528
and I'd like permission
to call it <i>Bananafish.</i>

625
00:31:46.561 --> 00:31:48.063
as Salinger was her fav...

626
00:32:05.513 --> 00:32:07.582
Titles can't
be copyrighted.

627
00:32:07.615 --> 00:32:08.584
I could write a novel

628
00:32:08.616 --> 00:32:11.252
and call it
<i>The Great Gatsby</i> if I wanted to.

629
00:32:11.286 --> 00:32:14.623
So. yes. she can call
her magazine <i>Bananafish.</i>

630
00:32:14.655 --> 00:32:16.157
Great!

631
00:32:16.191 --> 00:32:20.296
But the agency
can't advise her.

632
00:32:20.328 --> 00:32:21.596
As always...

633
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:22.798
Really?

634
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:26.134
Yep! I'm just telling you this
for your own edification.

635
00:32:26.167 --> 00:32:28.169
Send the form letter
and finish shredding.

636
00:32:28.202 --> 00:32:29.238
That's absurd!

637
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:30.605
Well. of course.
you're right.

638
00:32:30.638 --> 00:32:32.140
She's gonna start
yelling at me

639
00:32:32.173 --> 00:32:33.375
the minute she's
off the phone.

640
00:32:34.542 --> 00:32:38.180
A pleasure to talk to you.
Jerry. as always. Goodbye!

641
00:32:39.381 --> 00:32:40.682
Crap sandwich!

642
00:32:40.715 --> 00:32:42.217
- Hugh!
- Yes?

643
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.752
Do you have the Salinger
contract ready?

644
00:32:44.786 --> 00:32:46.188
Yes. almost there.

645
00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:47.690
Ask Pam to
call a messenger

646
00:32:47.722 --> 00:32:50.759
so we can get it over to
<i>The New Yorker</i> before 6:00.

647
00:32:50.791 --> 00:32:52.627
<i>The New Yorker?</i>

648
00:32:52.661 --> 00:32:54.196
Yes.

649
00:32:54.229 --> 00:32:57.232
Probably best if I just
bring it myself then. no?

650
00:33:00.234 --> 00:33:02.570
<i>I grew up reading</i>
The New Yorker.

651
00:33:02.604 --> 00:33:04.373
<i>following my father's ritual.</i>

652
00:33:04.405 --> 00:33:06.608
<i>He would start
with the movie reviews.</i>

653
00:33:06.642 --> 00:33:09.144
<i>and then turn to
"The Talk of the Town."</i>

654
00:33:09.178 --> 00:33:10.413
<i>and then the features.</i>

655
00:33:10.445 --> 00:33:13.749
<i>In college. everyone was
into</i> The New Yorker.

656
00:33:18.554 --> 00:33:20.256
Hi!

657
00:33:20.288 --> 00:33:23.358
My boss wanted me to make sure
this was delivered right away.

658
00:33:23.392 --> 00:33:24.326
Thank you!

659
00:33:29.798 --> 00:33:31.666
Can I help you
with something else?

660
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.736
No. No!

661
00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:35.438
No. no. that was it. thanks.

662
00:33:51.586 --> 00:33:54.557
I was at the Algonquin
serving him a martini.

663
00:33:54.589 --> 00:33:58.626
Anyway. I used my <i>Cosmo</i> ID
to get in the room.

664
00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.665
I recognized the agent.
He did not recognize me.

665
00:34:02.698 --> 00:34:05.834
And we spent the evening talking
about William's tragic death

666
00:34:05.866 --> 00:34:06.935
and the agency.

667
00:34:06.969 --> 00:34:08.304
And?

668
00:34:08.336 --> 00:34:09.838
And I lost my job at <i>Cosmo</i>

669
00:34:09.871 --> 00:34:11.706
for not showing up
the next morning.

670
00:34:13.641 --> 00:34:15.543
But I kept the man's card.

671
00:34:15.577 --> 00:34:19.281
and a year later. I gave him
a call at the agency...

672
00:34:19.313 --> 00:34:21.317
Hi...

673
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:22.918
...and he hired me.

674
00:34:22.951 --> 00:34:25.688
And the rest is history.
Joanna. what is it?

675
00:34:25.721 --> 00:34:27.356
- Is something wrong?
- No.

676
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:31.559
She was walking by. looking
cold and hungry and forlorn.

677
00:34:31.592 --> 00:34:33.361
I invited her in.
Joanna. please sit.

678
00:34:33.394 --> 00:34:34.896
I don't want to interrupt.

679
00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:37.599
Don't be silly.
This is my wife. Helen.

680
00:34:37.632 --> 00:34:38.634
Nice to meet you.

681
00:34:38.666 --> 00:34:39.969
We were just reminiscing.

682
00:34:40.001 --> 00:34:41.936
telling tales about
the lost generation:

683
00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:43.404
Hemingway. Fitzgerald.

684
00:34:43.438 --> 00:34:45.740
Do you know the agency
represented Fitzgerald?

685
00:34:45.773 --> 00:34:46.909
Yes. and Dylan Thomas.

686
00:34:46.942 --> 00:34:48.777
Langston Hughes.
Agatha Christie.

687
00:34:48.809 --> 00:34:51.579
And you've read all
their work. of course?

688
00:34:51.612 --> 00:34:53.548
I have. however.
my boss suggests

689
00:34:53.581 --> 00:34:55.583
that I read writers
that are alive.

690
00:34:55.617 --> 00:34:58.454
Speaking of living writers.

691
00:34:58.487 --> 00:35:00.588
are you familiar
with Rachel Cusk?

692
00:35:00.621 --> 00:35:01.990
Don't take
the bait. Joanna.

693
00:35:02.023 --> 00:35:03.726
No. I am.
Yes. I am. I am!

694
00:35:03.759 --> 00:35:05.994
Uh. her first novel.
<i>Saving Agnes.</i> was huge.

695
00:35:06.027 --> 00:35:08.296
It won the Whitbread. I think.

696
00:35:08.329 --> 00:35:11.266
And everyone that I knew
in London was reading it.

697
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.003
It was our lives. basically.
Or it was... it was my... my life.

698
00:35:14.036 --> 00:35:15.938
What is it about?

699
00:35:15.971 --> 00:35:17.773
Um...

700
00:35:17.806 --> 00:35:19.907
Well. it's a coming-of-age
tale. definitely.

701
00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.343
I guess it's about
the ways in which

702
00:35:22.376 --> 00:35:25.280
women need to get over this
self-loathing of their bodies.

703
00:35:25.313 --> 00:35:27.782
I'd say it's more
about how the patriarchy

704
00:35:27.815 --> 00:35:30.551
imposes rigid and terrifying
ideas of femininity

705
00:35:30.585 --> 00:35:32.554
onto young women.

706
00:35:32.586 --> 00:35:35.791
how that paralyzes them and
strips them of their dignity.

707
00:35:35.824 --> 00:35:38.594
I don't know. It doesn't feel
quite that didactic to me.

708
00:35:38.626 --> 00:35:40.395
It's a very introspective novel.

709
00:35:40.429 --> 00:35:42.597
It doesn't really read
like social commentary.

710
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.067
OK. Joanna. meet Rachel Cusk.

711
00:35:47.335 --> 00:35:48.636
Hello.

712
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.072
No. no. I'm so sorry.

713
00:35:51.106 --> 00:35:53.609
It's OK.
It's lovely to meet you.

714
00:35:53.641 --> 00:35:55.576
You're a novelist yourself?

715
00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:58.047
Joanna is my assistant.
I don't hire writers.

716
00:35:58.079 --> 00:35:59.882
- I'm very particular about it.
- Really?

717
00:35:59.914 --> 00:36:01.817
I thought all
publishing assistants

718
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:04.052
were writing novels
at their desks.

719
00:36:04.085 --> 00:36:06.487
If you can write
a novel at your desk

720
00:36:06.521 --> 00:36:09.024
while getting coffee for a
tyrant like Margaret. good luck.

721
00:36:09.056 --> 00:36:11.359
You really have to love it.

722
00:36:11.393 --> 00:36:13.929
You have to want it more than
anything in the entire world.

723
00:36:13.961 --> 00:36:15.496
more than a boyfriend

724
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.700
or a closet full
of pretty dresses

725
00:36:17.733 --> 00:36:21.003
or a fancy job that
makes everyone jealous.

726
00:36:21.036 --> 00:36:24.505
You need to be OK
with saying no

727
00:36:24.539 --> 00:36:25.908
when you're
invited to a party.

728
00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.408
And you really
need to be OK

729
00:36:27.442 --> 00:36:28.943
with your mother
and father hating you!

730
00:36:30.411 --> 00:36:32.380
Joanna. don't you have
dictation to finish?

731
00:36:32.414 --> 00:36:33.949
Yes. I do.

732
00:36:33.981 --> 00:36:35.550
Margaret...

733
00:36:35.583 --> 00:36:37.352
Those St. Martin's
contract memos

734
00:36:37.385 --> 00:36:39.021
need to go out
immediately.

735
00:36:39.054 --> 00:36:41.389
Absolutely. It was nice
to meet you. Thank you.

736
00:36:41.422 --> 00:36:42.490
- Bye!
- Goodbye. Joanna!

737
00:36:42.523 --> 00:36:43.458
Lovely to meet you.

738
00:36:48.996 --> 00:36:50.465
Ah!

739
00:37:23.097 --> 00:37:25.567
Hi!

740
00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:28.136
You got a letter.

741
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:30.472
from your high school
sweetheart. Karl.

742
00:37:33.208 --> 00:37:35.510
Does he know about us?

743
00:37:37.778 --> 00:37:39.514
Yeah. I'm sure
I mentioned it.

744
00:37:39.547 --> 00:37:41.115
Joanna. did you
break up with him?

745
00:37:41.148 --> 00:37:42.650
Like a proper break up:

746
00:37:42.684 --> 00:37:44.586
"Dear Karl.
it's not you. it's me.

747
00:37:44.619 --> 00:37:45.887
I'm sorry. It's over."

748
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.588
You know. the normal stuff?

749
00:37:47.621 --> 00:37:49.123
We haven't talked in 3 months.

750
00:37:49.157 --> 00:37:51.626
And he knows that I'm not
going back to California.

751
00:37:53.128 --> 00:37:55.463
Um...

752
00:37:55.496 --> 00:37:58.933
Did you talk to the
landlady about the heating?

753
00:37:58.967 --> 00:38:01.470
"Why do you need a heater?

754
00:38:01.503 --> 00:38:03.739
Your love should keep you warm."

755
00:38:33.201 --> 00:38:35.971
<i>I was hoping you might find
the time to write back.</i>

756
00:38:36.003 --> 00:38:39.040
but I bet you must be
getting a lot of letters.

757
00:38:39.074 --> 00:38:42.144
But I feel like writing again.
if you don't mind me doing so.

758
00:38:42.177 --> 00:38:45.847
'cause. um. well.
I feel depressed as hell.

759
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.183
And I figured it was
the honest thing do.

760
00:38:49.885 --> 00:38:52.788
Your characters are
the only ones in literature

761
00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.056
who are truly like me.

762
00:38:54.088 --> 00:38:55.590
I mean. they take action.

763
00:38:55.623 --> 00:38:57.725
They don't sit around
contemplating suicide.

764
00:38:57.759 --> 00:39:00.496
They pick up a gun and they
shoot themselves in the head.

765
00:39:00.528 --> 00:39:02.664
He's challenging Jerry.

766
00:39:02.697 --> 00:39:04.967
It's a game.
and you're falling for it.

767
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.603
I feel this boy just
deserves a proper response.

768
00:39:07.635 --> 00:39:08.704
not our usual bullshit.

769
00:39:08.737 --> 00:39:10.005
Bullshit?

770
00:39:11.172 --> 00:39:15.911
You are confusing
judgment with empathy.

771
00:39:15.943 --> 00:39:19.248
I have read hundreds of
letters just like this one.

772
00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.085
It can get overwhelming.
but just do your job.

773
00:39:35.931 --> 00:39:37.833
Did you send my letter
to Mr. Salinger?

774
00:39:37.865 --> 00:39:39.634
Did you send my letter
to Salinger?

775
00:39:39.668 --> 00:39:41.637
You have no right
to keep my letter!

776
00:39:42.971 --> 00:39:45.007
You can't read
other people's mail!

777
00:39:45.039 --> 00:39:47.208
I was at least
expecting a confirmation.

778
00:40:00.922 --> 00:40:04.559
<i>Dear Mr. Salinger.
I hate school.</i>

779
00:40:04.592 --> 00:40:06.861
<i>especially English class.</i>

780
00:40:06.894 --> 00:40:09.764
Catcher in the Rye
<i>is the only book I liked.</i>

781
00:40:09.797 --> 00:40:12.667
<i>My teacher is going to
make me flunk.</i>

782
00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:14.903
<i>She says I'll have to
repeat my year.</i>

783
00:40:14.936 --> 00:40:17.072
<i>and that's gonna be
so embarrassing.</i>

784
00:40:17.105 --> 00:40:20.007
<i>So I asked her:
"What can I do?"</i>

785
00:40:20.041 --> 00:40:22.611
<i>"Write a letter to
J.D. Salinger." she told me.</i>

786
00:40:22.643 --> 00:40:24.712
<i>"and make it so good
that he'll write back.</i>

787
00:40:24.746 --> 00:40:26.715
<i>If he writes back.
I'll give you an A."</i>

788
00:40:28.682 --> 00:40:31.719
Please write back
so I can get an A.

789
00:40:35.056 --> 00:40:37.192
<i>"An A earned by trickery</i>

790
00:40:37.224 --> 00:40:38.893
<i>"means absolutely nothing.</i>

791
00:40:38.927 --> 00:40:40.796
<i>"You'll soon find out
that young women</i>

792
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:42.631
<i>"are often held
to double standards</i>

793
00:40:42.664 --> 00:40:44.033
<i>when it comes to success."</i>

794
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.837
<i>"You need to prove to yourself
and to your peers</i>

795
00:40:49.871 --> 00:40:52.007
<i>"that you do not need
special treatment.</i>

796
00:40:53.173 --> 00:40:55.978
<i>"If you desire an A
or a passing grade.</i>

797
00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:58.746
<i>"you must do the work
assigned to you.</i>

798
00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:02.618
<i>"And if you want to uphold
the spirit of Holden.</i>

799
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:05.353
<i>"try not to care too much
about how people judge you.</i>

800
00:41:05.387 --> 00:41:08.090
<i>"This might mean
being more humble.</i>

801
00:41:08.123 --> 00:41:10.025
<i>"but it's the only way.</i>

802
00:41:10.057 --> 00:41:12.795
<i>Sincerely. Joanna Rakoff."</i>

803
00:41:19.233 --> 00:41:23.170
You've become quite the expert
in what Salinger would say.

804
00:41:23.204 --> 00:41:26.842
"If you want to uphold
the spirit of Holden..."

805
00:41:26.875 --> 00:41:29.077
Have you read
<i>Catcher</i> yet?

806
00:41:31.112 --> 00:41:32.847
You haven't!

807
00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:36.352
Unbelievable!

808
00:41:43.123 --> 00:41:45.393
Bret got accepted
at Case Western.

809
00:41:45.427 --> 00:41:47.429
Thought he was
going to Brooklyn Law.

810
00:41:47.461 --> 00:41:51.132
He's from the Midwest.
He misses it. you know?

811
00:41:51.166 --> 00:41:53.735
So you'll stay here
until he's done?

812
00:41:53.768 --> 00:41:57.005
Of course not.
I'm going with him.

813
00:41:57.038 --> 00:41:58.873
We're engaged. remember?

814
00:41:59.974 --> 00:42:02.945
Hey. you're moving?

815
00:42:04.411 --> 00:42:07.281
I... I thought you
loved your work?

816
00:42:07.315 --> 00:42:10.786
I do! But Cleveland
is a cool city.

817
00:42:10.818 --> 00:42:14.021
We're already looking
for a place in Shaker Heights.

818
00:42:14.054 --> 00:42:17.759
Wow! The suburbs!

819
00:42:20.094 --> 00:42:22.263
Have you been
writing lately?

820
00:42:23.797 --> 00:42:26.134
I don't really
write anymore.

821
00:42:27.402 --> 00:42:30.972
I know we used to say that
we wanted to become writers.

822
00:42:31.005 --> 00:42:32.773
but that was
more your thing.

823
00:42:32.806 --> 00:42:34.142
I kind of
grew out of it.

824
00:42:38.313 --> 00:42:41.717
You make it sound
like a teenage phase.

825
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:43.217
Isn't that what it was?

826
00:42:43.251 --> 00:42:44.419
I don't understand.

827
00:42:44.452 --> 00:42:46.321
You'll drop everything
for Bret's project?

828
00:42:46.353 --> 00:42:48.789
Whoa. Joanna. stop!

829
00:42:48.822 --> 00:42:50.391
I don't want to be a writer.

830
00:42:50.425 --> 00:42:52.360
You keep saying
you wanna write.

831
00:42:52.393 --> 00:42:54.862
but you work long hours
for other writers

832
00:42:54.896 --> 00:42:56.465
while Don is at
home writing his novel.

833
00:42:56.498 --> 00:42:58.300
Oh. we both write.

834
00:42:58.333 --> 00:43:00.469
And we're supportive
of each other's work.

835
00:43:00.501 --> 00:43:02.471
Well. then I'm
happy for you guys!

836
00:43:02.503 --> 00:43:04.706
Please be happy for me.

837
00:43:08.909 --> 00:43:10.244
I'm sorry.

838
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.282
Um...

839
00:43:15.784 --> 00:43:19.121
Why don't we go to
the Waldorf and eat dessert?

840
00:43:19.153 --> 00:43:21.889
Ha! I'll have
the $12 cheesecake.

841
00:43:21.922 --> 00:43:25.025
Maybe we'll catch my boss on
her martini lunch or something.

842
00:43:25.059 --> 00:43:26.495
Gotta get
back to work.

843
00:43:39.474 --> 00:43:42.478
- Everything to your liking?
- Yes. Thank you.

844
00:44:31.259 --> 00:44:32.961
May I get
you a cab?

845
00:44:32.994 --> 00:44:35.430
Oh. it's such a nice day.
I think I'll walk.

846
00:44:35.463 --> 00:44:38.333
It is a beautiful day.
You enjoy it.

847
00:44:38.365 --> 00:44:40.235
Thanks!

848
00:44:48.876 --> 00:44:50.211
<i>Hello?</i>

849
00:44:50.244 --> 00:44:52.980
<i>Hello. Suzanna!
How are you today?</i>

850
00:44:53.014 --> 00:44:56.184
<i>I'm... I'm great. How are you?
How's the weather in Cornish?</i>

851
00:44:56.217 --> 00:44:59.421
<i>It's very pleasant.
Uh. tell me something. Suzanna.</i>

852
00:44:59.454 --> 00:45:01.523
<i>I was looking at those books</i>

853
00:45:01.556 --> 00:45:05.260
<i>from this fellow Clifford in
Virginia. Merrybells Press.</i>

854
00:45:05.293 --> 00:45:06.327
<i>Yes...</i>

855
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.929
<i>What do you think of them?</i>

856
00:45:07.961 --> 00:45:09.264
<i>Um...</i>

857
00:45:09.297 --> 00:45:11.499
Honestly. I think
the design isn't great.

858
00:45:11.532 --> 00:45:15.003
I think they'd really benefit
from hiring a designer.

859
00:45:15.036 --> 00:45:17.271
Uh. but as far as
the books themselves.

860
00:45:17.304 --> 00:45:18.906
I've only read a few.

861
00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:21.376
I do like some of the poets
they publish. though.

862
00:45:21.409 --> 00:45:23.111
<i>Oh. you read poetry?</i>

863
00:45:23.143 --> 00:45:25.012
I do. yes. a lot!

864
00:45:25.045 --> 00:45:26.614
<i>But do you write
poetry yourself?</i>

865
00:45:26.648 --> 00:45:27.682
I do!

866
00:45:27.715 --> 00:45:30.085
<i>Well. I'm very glad
to hear that.</i>

867
00:45:30.117 --> 00:45:32.386
<i>Poetry is food for the soul.</i>

868
00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.255
<i>Never forget that.</i>

869
00:45:34.289 --> 00:45:35.957
<i>uh. Suzanna.</i>

870
00:45:35.989 --> 00:45:39.093
<i>Food for the soul.
I've got it!</i>

871
00:45:39.126 --> 00:45:42.096
<i>Uh. Suzanna. it's important
to write everyday.</i>

872
00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:43.498
<i>You know that?</i>

873
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:46.166
I'll keep that in mind.

874
00:45:46.199 --> 00:45:48.335
Jerry wants to meet Clifford.

875
00:45:48.369 --> 00:45:50.038
Gosh!

876
00:45:51.204 --> 00:45:52.641
We have to find
somewhere discreet.

877
00:45:52.673 --> 00:45:54.309
Well. it won't be.

878
00:45:54.342 --> 00:45:57.077
Jerry's driving down to
Washington on Wednesday.

879
00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:00.147
They're meeting in a cafeteria
at Georgetown University.

880
00:46:00.181 --> 00:46:02.483
That's awful! Awful!

881
00:46:02.516 --> 00:46:06.086
Uh. do we trust
this Clifford fellow?

882
00:46:06.119 --> 00:46:07.320
I don't know.

883
00:46:07.355 --> 00:46:11.626
So. we're presuming he's
not gonna tip off <i>The Post</i>

884
00:46:11.659 --> 00:46:14.528
that the world's
most reclusive writer.

885
00:46:14.561 --> 00:46:16.030
who barely leaves his home.

886
00:46:16.063 --> 00:46:17.998
who hasn't given an
interview in decades.

887
00:46:18.032 --> 00:46:19.534
will be having lunch

888
00:46:19.567 --> 00:46:22.170
at Georgetown University
on Wednesday?

889
00:46:22.202 --> 00:46:24.438
Yeah.

890
00:46:24.472 --> 00:46:27.709
You have mentioned this
possibility to Jerry?

891
00:46:27.742 --> 00:46:31.046
I have not. Jerry thinks
of Clifford as a pal.

892
00:46:31.079 --> 00:46:33.081
If I say anything
negative about him.

893
00:46:33.114 --> 00:46:34.682
Jerry will not take it kindly.

894
00:46:34.715 --> 00:46:36.918
That's it.
Back to work.

895
00:46:38.251 --> 00:46:43.090
Oh. Joanna. tell me
what you think of this.

896
00:46:45.492 --> 00:46:47.027
Judy Blume?

897
00:46:47.061 --> 00:46:48.129
You've heard of her?

898
00:46:48.161 --> 00:46:49.663
Of course I have!

899
00:46:49.697 --> 00:46:51.967
I read all of
her books as a kid.

900
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.168
I love her.
Everyone loves her.

901
00:46:54.202 --> 00:46:56.237
She was a client of
my predecessor. Claire.

902
00:46:56.269 --> 00:46:58.105
She's not written
a book in a long time.

903
00:46:58.139 --> 00:47:00.108
Have you ever
read Judy Blume?

904
00:47:00.141 --> 00:47:03.311
No. I don't read
children's literature.

905
00:47:03.344 --> 00:47:05.046
But they're
so wonderful!

906
00:47:05.079 --> 00:47:08.182
I'm sure! Claire
had impeccable taste.

907
00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:11.619
You wanna go out?

908
00:47:11.652 --> 00:47:14.088
We're broke.

909
00:47:14.121 --> 00:47:17.259
So? We'll split a beer.

910
00:47:19.193 --> 00:47:21.363
It's open mic night at the KGB.

911
00:47:23.063 --> 00:47:24.498
What?

912
00:47:24.532 --> 00:47:27.402
Well. bring a poem.
They'll love you.

913
00:47:27.434 --> 00:47:29.137
You're not funny.

914
00:47:30.237 --> 00:47:31.572
I'm not trying to be.

915
00:47:32.672 --> 00:47:34.709
Your poems are good.

916
00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:37.778
I have a Judy Blume
manuscript to read.

917
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:39.246
Judy Blume?

918
00:47:40.313 --> 00:47:42.049
Judy fucking Blume?

919
00:47:43.217 --> 00:47:45.787
I loved <i>Then Again.
Maybe I Won't.</i>

920
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.588
You like Judy Blume?

921
00:47:47.621 --> 00:47:49.590
Yeah. I mean.
I was a kid once.

922
00:47:49.623 --> 00:47:52.259
And like her hero. Tony.
my parents were working class

923
00:47:52.293 --> 00:47:53.695
and moved to
a middle-class area.

924
00:47:53.728 --> 00:47:55.363
It's about social class.

925
00:47:55.396 --> 00:47:57.065
No. it's not!

926
00:47:58.398 --> 00:48:01.568
It turns you on that
I like pedestrian stuff.

927
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:03.637
doesn't it?

928
00:48:19.519 --> 00:48:21.623
<i>To be given
Judy Blume's new book</i>

929
00:48:21.655 --> 00:48:24.125
<i>was like going from
sitting in the stands</i>

930
00:48:24.157 --> 00:48:25.360
<i>to hitting a home run.</i>

931
00:48:26.626 --> 00:48:28.697
<i>I felt lucky
to be on the inside.</i>

932
00:48:30.731 --> 00:48:31.833
Well?

933
00:48:31.865 --> 00:48:33.068
I like it.

934
00:48:33.101 --> 00:48:34.135
Really?

935
00:48:34.168 --> 00:48:36.304
But what do
you make of it?

936
00:48:37.438 --> 00:48:38.706
I'm not sure what you mean.

937
00:48:38.739 --> 00:48:41.076
Well. it's not
a kids book. is it?

938
00:48:41.108 --> 00:48:44.311
No. no. it's about
kids for grown-ups.

939
00:48:44.344 --> 00:48:45.679
It's about female friendship.

940
00:48:45.713 --> 00:48:49.184
But will adults buy
a book about kids?

941
00:48:49.217 --> 00:48:50.684
Can I sell it?

942
00:48:53.554 --> 00:48:55.657
Lots of books have
child protagonists.

943
00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:56.825
Um. <i>Oliver Twist!</i>

944
00:48:56.858 --> 00:48:59.561
This is not <i>Oliver Twist.</i>

945
00:48:59.594 --> 00:49:01.296
But you would buy it?

946
00:49:01.329 --> 00:49:02.730
I would.

947
00:49:02.762 --> 00:49:04.565
Hmm...

948
00:49:04.599 --> 00:49:07.202
Many people would.

949
00:49:07.235 --> 00:49:09.637
There's the nostalgia factor.

950
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:12.541
You know. my entire generation
grew up on Judy Blume.

951
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:14.809
Maybe.

952
00:49:14.842 --> 00:49:16.278
Definitely.

953
00:49:19.646 --> 00:49:21.482
All right.
You've had your fun.

954
00:49:25.853 --> 00:49:28.490
I put new tapes
on your desk.

955
00:49:28.523 --> 00:49:30.325
Close the door.

956
00:49:38.766 --> 00:49:40.501
I got the deal.

957
00:49:40.534 --> 00:49:42.436
For sure. she was very happy.

958
00:49:42.469 --> 00:49:45.606
Judy! Margaret
is expecting you.

959
00:49:45.639 --> 00:49:47.241
Oh!

960
00:49:47.275 --> 00:49:49.477
- Coffee?
- No.

961
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:51.613
That's very exciting! Yes.

962
00:49:52.679 --> 00:49:53.882
What is it?

963
00:49:53.914 --> 00:49:55.315
Judy Blume is here.

964
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:57.318
Shit!

965
00:49:57.351 --> 00:49:59.653
Uh. Michael.
hold on one second.

966
00:49:59.686 --> 00:50:01.688
That's today?

967
00:50:01.722 --> 00:50:03.425
I thought we
had more time.

968
00:50:04.592 --> 00:50:06.360
She's going to
blow this. isn't she?

969
00:50:06.393 --> 00:50:07.461
I think so.

970
00:50:08.963 --> 00:50:10.465
Hey!

971
00:50:10.498 --> 00:50:13.534
We've been renovating.
moving everything around.

972
00:50:13.568 --> 00:50:16.671
which is why your books are
down there and out of order.

973
00:50:16.704 --> 00:50:17.906
Don't worry about it.

974
00:50:17.938 --> 00:50:19.173
I'm Joanna.

975
00:50:19.206 --> 00:50:20.574
I'm Margaret's
new assistant.

976
00:50:20.608 --> 00:50:22.677
And I'm such a huge
fan of yours.

977
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:24.913
- That's very sweet of you.
- Really nice to meet you.

978
00:50:24.945 --> 00:50:27.214
- Judy!
- Hi!

979
00:50:27.248 --> 00:50:29.751
How lovely to see you!
Come into my office.

980
00:50:29.784 --> 00:50:30.919
Good!

981
00:50:32.219 --> 00:50:33.721
Please take a seat.

982
00:50:34.822 --> 00:50:36.191
You know the way.

983
00:50:37.557 --> 00:50:38.826
So...

984
00:50:55.876 --> 00:50:58.513
I'm not sure
it could attract readers...

985
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.482
Joanna?

986
00:51:02.617 --> 00:51:04.552
Why don't you answer your phone?

987
00:51:04.585 --> 00:51:06.788
There's someone at the reception
who wants to see you.

988
00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:08.690
Me?

989
00:51:16.731 --> 00:51:18.433
Are you Joanna Rakoff?

990
00:51:18.465 --> 00:51:20.567
- Yes!
- Is that your real name?

991
00:51:20.601 --> 00:51:21.936
It's so ridiculous.
it sounds fake.

992
00:51:24.938 --> 00:51:27.442
You have no right to keep
my letter from Salinger.

993
00:51:27.474 --> 00:51:29.543
I'm sorry. Who are you?

994
00:51:29.577 --> 00:51:31.512
Because of you.
I'm going to fail English!

995
00:51:31.545 --> 00:51:32.947
Is everything all right here?

996
00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:35.416
- Yes.
- No.

997
00:51:35.449 --> 00:51:37.552
Why don't we go downstairs
and get a coffee. OK?

998
00:51:37.585 --> 00:51:39.588
Joanna?

999
00:51:41.554 --> 00:51:43.423
Aren't you supposed
to be in school?

1000
00:51:43.456 --> 00:51:44.791
Who do you
think you are?

1001
00:51:44.824 --> 00:51:47.294
It's my job here to
answer Jerry's mail.

1002
00:51:47.327 --> 00:51:48.963
Oh. it's Jerry to you?

1003
00:51:48.996 --> 00:51:50.530
Is he your sugar daddy?

1004
00:51:50.563 --> 00:51:54.534
No. I... I've never
even met him. OK?

1005
00:51:54.568 --> 00:51:57.672
Mr. Salinger does not
want to receive his mail.

1006
00:51:57.704 --> 00:52:00.007
So instead you lecture me
like you're my mother.

1007
00:52:01.074 --> 00:52:03.343
You're right. OK?

1008
00:52:03.376 --> 00:52:04.878
I'm sorry.

1009
00:52:04.911 --> 00:52:05.980
I apologize.

1010
00:52:06.012 --> 00:52:08.449
Your letter was different.

1011
00:52:08.481 --> 00:52:11.418
And I thought you deserved a
real response instead of our.

1012
00:52:11.452 --> 00:52:14.055
"I'm sorry we cannot pass along
your kind note." bullshit.

1013
00:52:14.088 --> 00:52:16.925
So I wrote you
something more personal.

1014
00:52:18.059 --> 00:52:19.627
What makes you
think your advice

1015
00:52:19.659 --> 00:52:21.362
is better than some
bullshit response?

1016
00:52:24.465 --> 00:52:26.367
I'm going to summer school.

1017
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.436
So thanks a lot.
Miss Rakoff.

1018
00:52:43.951 --> 00:52:46.788
You sent a personal letter
to one of the fans.

1019
00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:48.656
and she came
storming in here?

1020
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:52.059
Oh my gosh!

1021
00:52:53.094 --> 00:52:54.929
Oh my gosh!

1022
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:59.032
Do you have any idea
how many times.

1023
00:52:59.065 --> 00:53:01.468
when I was answering
Salinger's letters.

1024
00:53:01.501 --> 00:53:03.570
I wanted to write
my own one back?

1025
00:53:03.603 --> 00:53:04.838
Really?

1026
00:53:04.871 --> 00:53:06.507
Of course!

1027
00:53:06.539 --> 00:53:08.710
"Dear sir. obsess
over another writer.

1028
00:53:08.742 --> 00:53:11.778
I hear Kurt Vonnegut
answers his own fan mail!"

1029
00:53:11.811 --> 00:53:15.650
Sometimes. you just
wanna go: "Hey. loser!"

1030
00:53:15.682 --> 00:53:18.353
And... and then others...

1031
00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.788
...they're so engaging.

1032
00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.590
You just want to
champion them. you know?

1033
00:53:23.623 --> 00:53:25.359
Yes. yes! Exactly!

1034
00:53:25.393 --> 00:53:26.795
Yeah.

1035
00:53:28.528 --> 00:53:30.398
But you've
crossed the line.

1036
00:53:30.431 --> 00:53:34.501
It's a huge rabbit hole.
ethically and legally.

1037
00:53:34.534 --> 00:53:36.670
I'm taking you off
Salinger's mail.

1038
00:53:36.704 --> 00:53:37.839
- No. no.
- Yes.

1039
00:53:37.871 --> 00:53:40.375
Hugh. please. I love
these letters so much.

1040
00:53:40.407 --> 00:53:42.710
I promise you this won't
happen again. I promise.

1041
00:53:43.878 --> 00:53:45.413
Judy?

1042
00:53:47.047 --> 00:53:49.516
Ah. crap!

1043
00:53:50.583 --> 00:53:51.551
It's all over.

1044
00:53:51.585 --> 00:53:52.586
Judy?

1045
00:53:52.619 --> 00:53:53.688
She's leaving us.

1046
00:53:53.721 --> 00:53:54.889
For whom?

1047
00:53:54.922 --> 00:53:56.657
Does it matter?

1048
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:58.626
If I were Judy.
I would have left too.

1049
00:53:59.693 --> 00:54:01.095
Joanna...

1050
00:54:01.128 --> 00:54:02.997
Why?

1051
00:54:04.565 --> 00:54:06.867
Tell me. I'm curious.
Why would you leave?

1052
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.402
No. I'm really.
really sorry.

1053
00:54:08.436 --> 00:54:09.771
I didn't mean that.
I just. um...

1054
00:54:09.804 --> 00:54:14.575
I'm just sad to see
her leave. that's all.

1055
00:54:14.608 --> 00:54:18.980
Well. until you can articulate
a reason that will enlighten us.

1056
00:54:19.012 --> 00:54:21.815
you can go back to
typing your dictation.

1057
00:54:21.849 --> 00:54:25.153
And fetch Daniel's
prescriptions when you're done.

1058
00:54:27.454 --> 00:54:28.422
Close the door!

1059
00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:34.896
For crying out loud!
I can't believe it!

1060
00:54:34.929 --> 00:54:38.566
I still don't understand
what the hell she's thinking!

1061
00:54:48.742 --> 00:54:51.546
OK. you think that
when a man falls in love.

1062
00:54:51.579 --> 00:54:53.614
he doesn't look at
another woman. hmm?

1063
00:54:53.646 --> 00:54:54.681
But I have news for you.

1064
00:54:54.715 --> 00:54:57.184
Every man in this world
is looking at every woman

1065
00:54:57.217 --> 00:54:58.920
and deciding weather
or not she's...

1066
00:54:58.952 --> 00:54:59.920
He wants to fuck her?

1067
00:55:01.021 --> 00:55:03.490
She's sexy. Right?

1068
00:55:04.657 --> 00:55:07.027
Don. I think you
might be in a hole

1069
00:55:07.061 --> 00:55:09.163
and you might
wanna stop digging.

1070
00:55:09.195 --> 00:55:11.932
You think women don't
look at other men? We do.

1071
00:55:11.965 --> 00:55:13.701
We even look at other women.

1072
00:55:13.733 --> 00:55:15.902
We just don't drool
while we do it.

1073
00:55:18.271 --> 00:55:21.909
Buba. Buba...

1074
00:55:21.942 --> 00:55:24.579
I drool exclusively for you!

1075
00:55:24.612 --> 00:55:26.681
Hmm?

1076
00:55:26.713 --> 00:55:27.681
Hey!

1077
00:55:27.715 --> 00:55:28.583
White wine?

1078
00:55:28.615 --> 00:55:30.751
No thanks. I'm. uh...
I'm gonna go.

1079
00:55:30.784 --> 00:55:32.519
Don't leave.

1080
00:55:34.255 --> 00:55:35.690
Oh. I know.

1081
00:55:35.722 --> 00:55:39.527
I. um. I actually
came to give you this.

1082
00:55:39.559 --> 00:55:40.628
What's this?

1083
00:55:40.661 --> 00:55:42.096
It's from Karl.

1084
00:55:42.128 --> 00:55:44.898
He's coming to Washington
for a concert.

1085
00:55:44.931 --> 00:55:46.634
He really wants you to go.

1086
00:55:46.666 --> 00:55:49.036
You've been
in touch with Karl?

1087
00:55:49.068 --> 00:55:51.840
He wrote you a letter.
but you never answered.

1088
00:55:57.077 --> 00:55:58.880
Wednesday in DC.

1089
00:55:58.913 --> 00:56:00.681
Yeah.

1090
00:56:02.148 --> 00:56:04.018
What is it?

1091
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:06.953
Someone should go to
the meeting in Washington

1092
00:56:06.987 --> 00:56:08.222
with Clifford Bradbury.

1093
00:56:08.255 --> 00:56:10.791
make sure that
he's prepared

1094
00:56:10.824 --> 00:56:12.894
and walk him through
the agency's protocol.

1095
00:56:14.661 --> 00:56:16.697
He did sound
jittery on the phone.

1096
00:56:17.797 --> 00:56:19.032
I can't leave New York.

1097
00:56:19.065 --> 00:56:20.233
But I suppose I could send...

1098
00:56:20.266 --> 00:56:21.969
Me!

1099
00:56:22.001 --> 00:56:23.237
- You?
- Send me!

1100
00:56:25.072 --> 00:56:26.708
Why?

1101
00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.043
Take notes and
assist Clifford.

1102
00:56:31.244 --> 00:56:33.681
Just let me do this
for the agency.

1103
00:56:33.713 --> 00:56:34.982
Uh...

1104
00:56:37.083 --> 00:56:39.586
You are to go to Washington.

1105
00:56:39.619 --> 00:56:41.688
be the agency's
eyes and ears.

1106
00:56:41.722 --> 00:56:43.691
find out who this
Clifford person is.

1107
00:56:43.724 --> 00:56:45.726
You are to meet
with him beforehand

1108
00:56:45.759 --> 00:56:47.094
and debrief
him afterwards.

1109
00:56:47.126 --> 00:56:49.029
but you are not
to meet with Jerry.

1110
00:56:49.063 --> 00:56:51.097
Jerry must think they
are meeting on their own.

1111
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:52.632
Understood?

1112
00:56:52.666 --> 00:56:54.201
You will not regret this.

1113
00:56:54.233 --> 00:56:55.737
We'll see
about that.

1114
00:56:59.206 --> 00:57:01.309
Hey! Wait!

1115
00:57:01.342 --> 00:57:04.845
I've got a...
got a gift for you.

1116
00:57:04.878 --> 00:57:07.981
My birthday was 2 months ago.

1117
00:57:08.014 --> 00:57:10.917
Oh. well. birthdays
are for Hallmark.

1118
00:57:10.951 --> 00:57:12.219
It's. uh...

1119
00:57:13.286 --> 00:57:14.721
It's my novel.

1120
00:57:16.056 --> 00:57:17.592
You finished it?

1121
00:57:18.726 --> 00:57:20.061
What. don't you
want to read it?

1122
00:57:21.327 --> 00:57:23.898
Uh. of course I do! Yeah!

1123
00:57:24.931 --> 00:57:26.099
Thanks!

1124
00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.269
Congrats!

1125
00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:04.939
Mr. Bradbury?

1126
00:58:04.972 --> 00:58:06.273
Yes. Joanna!

1127
00:58:06.306 --> 00:58:07.942
- Hi!
- Hi!

1128
00:58:07.974 --> 00:58:09.710
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

1129
00:58:09.742 --> 00:58:11.679
I've widened the spine. see.

1130
00:58:11.711 --> 00:58:14.414
to give the book some length
because it's too thin.

1131
00:58:14.447 --> 00:58:16.384
I also re-typed it all
from <i>The New Yorker.</i>

1132
00:58:16.416 --> 00:58:18.052
I didn't scan it.

1133
00:58:18.085 --> 00:58:21.121
And good thing too. because
there were a few small typos.

1134
00:58:21.155 --> 00:58:23.290
<i>The New Yorker</i>
doesn't make typos!

1135
00:58:23.322 --> 00:58:26.826
Oh. yes! Small ones.
but typos still.

1136
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.063
Salinger is such a
stickler for details.

1137
00:58:29.096 --> 00:58:30.431
I made two mock-ups.

1138
00:58:30.463 --> 00:58:31.798
Wow!

1139
00:58:31.831 --> 00:58:33.233
Do you think I
should have made more?

1140
00:58:33.266 --> 00:58:34.234
No.

1141
00:58:34.268 --> 00:58:36.936
Oh. I think I should
have made more. yeah.

1142
00:58:36.969 --> 00:58:40.006
Mr. Bradbury.
it's gonna go very well.

1143
00:58:40.039 --> 00:58:43.210
Just forget everything that
you've heard about Mr. Salinger.

1144
00:58:43.242 --> 00:58:46.112
I think that you'll find that
he's very straightforward.

1145
00:58:46.146 --> 00:58:48.883
It's important that
you just be yourself.

1146
01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:19.306
What happened?

1147
01:00:21.175 --> 01:00:23.177
Jerry Salinger
paid for my lunch!

1148
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:24.878
But how did it go?

1149
01:00:25.978 --> 01:00:27.914
We agreed
on everything.

1150
01:00:27.947 --> 01:00:29.349
That's great!

1151
01:00:31.552 --> 01:00:33.287
I guess I just
missed him then. huh?

1152
01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.488
Except the typos.

1153
01:00:34.521 --> 01:00:35.990
What do you mean?

1154
01:00:36.023 --> 01:00:38.125
He did not want me
to correct them.

1155
01:00:38.157 --> 01:00:40.226
Yeah. he seemed peeved
that I fixed them.

1156
01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:41.428
I thought.
at one point.

1157
01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.363
he'd say: "Let's forget
the whole thing."

1158
01:00:43.396 --> 01:00:45.165
Did he say why?

1159
01:00:45.199 --> 01:00:48.068
He wants it printed exactly
as it ran in <i>The New Yorker.</i>

1160
01:00:48.101 --> 01:00:50.436
as if the typos were
actually intentional.

1161
01:00:50.469 --> 01:00:52.071
It makes no sense.

1162
01:00:52.105 --> 01:00:53.840
Hey.

1163
01:00:53.873 --> 01:00:56.042
Don't fix any more typos.

1164
01:00:56.076 --> 01:00:57.811
Don't tell anybody
about the book.

1165
01:00:57.844 --> 01:01:00.113
No interviews. That would
ruin the whole deal.

1166
01:01:01.215 --> 01:01:02.983
Yeah. we don't
want to do that.

1167
01:01:03.016 --> 01:01:04.552
Great work.
Mr. Bradbury!

1168
01:01:04.585 --> 01:01:06.954
My boss is going to be
very pleased. OK?

1169
01:01:06.987 --> 01:01:07.954
Bye!

1170
01:01:57.371 --> 01:01:59.073
- Jo!
- Hi!

1171
01:02:02.275 --> 01:02:04.244
You got my invitation.

1172
01:02:05.579 --> 01:02:06.914
Yeah.

1173
01:02:08.081 --> 01:02:10.951
Uh. I'm... I'm so
glad you're here.

1174
01:02:10.983 --> 01:02:12.186
You look great!

1175
01:02:12.219 --> 01:02:13.987
So do you!

1176
01:02:21.128 --> 01:02:24.131
I'm glad you're here. Jo.
I've been wanting to apologize.

1177
01:02:24.164 --> 01:02:25.333
What?

1178
01:02:26.565 --> 01:02:29.002
I was angry when I
sent you the letter.

1179
01:02:29.036 --> 01:02:30.537
I wrote stuff
I didn't mean.

1180
01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:33.106
No. don't apologize.
You should be angry.

1181
01:02:33.139 --> 01:02:36.109
I'm... I'm angry at you
for not being angry at me.

1182
01:02:36.143 --> 01:02:39.213
I'm... I'm not angry.
and that's absurd. by the way.

1183
01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:45.085
You hurt me. and I
needed to unleash.

1184
01:02:45.117 --> 01:02:48.889
I deserved a proper
break-up. you know.

1185
01:02:50.423 --> 01:02:52.425
You know. "Karl.
I'm leaving you."

1186
01:02:52.458 --> 01:02:54.394
you know.
the usual stuff.

1187
01:02:54.427 --> 01:02:56.230
Yeah...

1188
01:02:57.697 --> 01:03:00.433
- The usual stuff.
- Mm-hmm.

1189
01:03:00.467 --> 01:03:02.936
The apartment felt
depressing when you left.

1190
01:03:05.105 --> 01:03:08.108
I didn't read...
I didn't read your letter.

1191
01:03:08.141 --> 01:03:10.476
Oh. wh-why?

1192
01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:12.580
No. I. um...

1193
01:03:14.146 --> 01:03:15.315
I couldn't
make it past Jo.

1194
01:03:17.583 --> 01:03:19.953
Nobody else
calls me Jo. so...

1195
01:03:22.722 --> 01:03:25.425
I want you back in my life.

1196
01:03:27.094 --> 01:03:29.329
You know. even if it's
just a phone call

1197
01:03:29.362 --> 01:03:30.563
every once in a while.

1198
01:03:31.664 --> 01:03:34.501
You were my best friend.

1199
01:03:36.003 --> 01:03:38.105
I miss you. Jo.

1200
01:04:07.233 --> 01:04:09.235
I miss you too.

1201
01:04:50.376 --> 01:04:54.213
I've learned that.
as phony as it may be.

1202
01:04:54.246 --> 01:04:57.350
you can't go around revealing
your goddamn emotions

1203
01:04:57.384 --> 01:04:58.619
to the world.

1204
01:04:58.652 --> 01:05:01.188
Most people don't
give a flying hoot

1205
01:05:01.221 --> 01:05:03.523
about. like.
what you think and feel

1206
01:05:03.556 --> 01:05:05.225
most of the time. I guess.

1207
01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.829
And if they see a weakness...

1208
01:05:08.862 --> 01:05:13.467
I mean. why. for God's sake.
is showing emotion a weakness?

1209
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.237
Boy. do they jump
all over you. right?

1210
01:05:17.503 --> 01:05:20.773
They seem to get right
in your goddamn face and...

1211
01:05:22.108 --> 01:05:26.047
...revel in the fact that you
are actually feeling something.

1212
01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:32.318
Is it good?

1213
01:05:33.519 --> 01:05:34.554
What?

1214
01:05:34.588 --> 01:05:36.390
The manuscript. is it good?

1215
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:40.359
It's interesting.

1216
01:05:41.527 --> 01:05:43.363
But you hate it?

1217
01:05:45.197 --> 01:05:46.766
I don't... I don't hate it.

1218
01:05:48.635 --> 01:05:52.373
Or maybe I do hate it.
and that's why it's good.

1219
01:05:54.273 --> 01:05:55.641
It's weirdly addictive.

1220
01:05:55.675 --> 01:05:57.311
But...

1221
01:05:57.344 --> 01:05:59.313
I don't want to read
about his sex life.

1222
01:05:59.346 --> 01:06:01.748
No one wants to read
about his sex life.

1223
01:06:04.251 --> 01:06:06.653
Maybe I'm just annoyed
by his nonchalance.

1224
01:06:08.288 --> 01:06:09.824
Or because...

1225
01:06:14.628 --> 01:06:16.730
He's writing and I'm not.

1226
01:06:51.398 --> 01:06:52.600
I understand.

1227
01:06:58.804 --> 01:07:00.239
What's going on?

1228
01:07:00.273 --> 01:07:01.441
Shhh!

1229
01:07:01.474 --> 01:07:04.411
Well. keep us posted
and thank you.

1230
01:07:12.219 --> 01:07:13.586
Apparently. he shot himself.

1231
01:07:15.255 --> 01:07:16.523
Wait. who...
who shot himself?

1232
01:07:16.556 --> 01:07:18.692
Daniel. Joanna.

1233
01:07:18.724 --> 01:07:20.460
Daniel committed suicide.

1234
01:07:21.527 --> 01:07:23.396
The Daniel?

1235
01:07:23.429 --> 01:07:27.900
In the living room. while
Margaret was in the bedroom.

1236
01:07:27.934 --> 01:07:31.438
This can't be right!
Daniel is a beautiful man.

1237
01:07:31.471 --> 01:07:36.277
He's sweet and he's kind and...
This can't be happening!

1238
01:07:37.876 --> 01:07:39.445
But he looked fine!

1239
01:07:39.478 --> 01:07:40.713
He was bipolar.

1240
01:07:40.746 --> 01:07:42.949
Margaret took care of him
all these years.

1241
01:07:42.983 --> 01:07:44.518
He was
her brother?

1242
01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:45.686
Lover.

1243
01:07:46.753 --> 01:07:47.721
Of 20 years.

1244
01:07:49.456 --> 01:07:51.758
Wait. are we talking
about the same Daniel?

1245
01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:54.595
Daniel was married to Helen.
whom you've met.

1246
01:07:54.628 --> 01:07:57.297
He lived half
the week with Helen

1247
01:07:57.329 --> 01:07:59.766
and the other
half with Margaret.

1248
01:07:59.798 --> 01:08:02.668
They... shared his care.

1249
01:08:02.702 --> 01:08:04.838
They shared him.

1250
01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:11.677
Margaret shared a man
with another woman?

1251
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:13.980
Joanna. if anyone calls.

1252
01:08:14.014 --> 01:08:16.583
tell them she's working
from home and take a message.

1253
01:08:16.615 --> 01:08:19.685
and no mention of this.

1254
01:08:19.719 --> 01:08:21.755
What about
if it's Jerry?

1255
01:08:21.787 --> 01:08:23.590
Especially if it's Jerry.

1256
01:08:51.818 --> 01:08:53.787
Can you please do that
some other time?

1257
01:08:54.988 --> 01:08:56.523
Fine.

1258
01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:01.761
Thanks.

1259
01:09:25.685 --> 01:09:27.988
<i>Margaret's office.
Joanna speaking.</i>

1260
01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.590
Hi. Joanna!
It's Jerry. How are you?

1261
01:09:30.622 --> 01:09:32.591
<i>Hi! I'm well.
How are you?</i>

1262
01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:33.960
How is the weather down there?

1263
01:09:33.993 --> 01:09:35.395
<i>Muggy.</i>

1264
01:09:35.427 --> 01:09:37.096
Is your boss around?

1265
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:39.333
No. I'm afraid she's out.

1266
01:09:39.365 --> 01:09:41.001
<i>She's been out a lot lately.</i>

1267
01:09:42.534 --> 01:09:46.739
Yeah. she's very busy.
lots of meetings.

1268
01:09:46.773 --> 01:09:48.775
Is there anything
I can help you with?

1269
01:09:48.807 --> 01:09:50.577
Let me ask you something.

1270
01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:53.846
This. uh.
Clifford Bradbury fellow...

1271
01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.382
<i>Sure.</i>

1272
01:09:55.414 --> 01:09:56.682
What do you make of him?

1273
01:09:56.716 --> 01:09:57.617
<i>I like him.</i>

1274
01:09:57.650 --> 01:10:00.519
Sometimes. I think
he can overthink things.

1275
01:10:00.552 --> 01:10:03.657
but he just doesn't
want to let you down.

1276
01:10:03.689 --> 01:10:06.156
Have you been
writing every day?

1277
01:10:06.158 --> 01:10:08.127
<i>A lot of days.</i>

1278
01:10:08.161 --> 01:10:11.498
<i>They've given me more
responsibility around here.</i>

1279
01:10:11.530 --> 01:10:13.899
so I've been
reading manuscripts!

1280
01:10:13.932 --> 01:10:16.936
<i>You're a writer. Joanna.
aren't you?</i>

1281
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:20.708
<i>Not an agent. not a secretary.</i>

1282
01:10:22.175 --> 01:10:23.710
I don't know.

1283
01:10:23.743 --> 01:10:25.545
<i>Sorry. I missed that.</i>

1284
01:10:25.578 --> 01:10:27.348
<i>I'm a little deaf.</i>

1285
01:10:28.448 --> 01:10:30.617
Yes. um. yes!

1286
01:10:32.018 --> 01:10:33.552
I'm a writer.

1287
01:10:33.586 --> 01:10:35.588
<i>So write!</i>

1288
01:10:35.622 --> 01:10:38.625
Even if it's just
15 minutes in the morning.

1289
01:10:38.658 --> 01:10:41.061
Protect that sanctuary. OK?

1290
01:10:41.094 --> 01:10:44.730
<i>Don't get stuck answering
the phone. Joanna.</i>

1291
01:10:44.764 --> 01:10:46.400
<i>You're a poet!</i>

1292
01:11:17.463 --> 01:11:19.198
- Hey!
- Hey. Mark!

1293
01:11:31.176 --> 01:11:34.713
What is it like.
working for <i>The New Yorker?</i>

1294
01:11:34.747 --> 01:11:37.584
Well. why don't you come
by the office one day?

1295
01:11:37.617 --> 01:11:39.052
We'll show you around.

1296
01:11:39.085 --> 01:11:41.654
I would like that very much!

1297
01:11:41.688 --> 01:11:43.824
Do you
write yourself?

1298
01:11:43.856 --> 01:11:45.492
Uh...

1299
01:11:46.893 --> 01:11:49.628
It's OK! We won't
tell your boss!

1300
01:11:49.662 --> 01:11:52.466
I... I've published two poems
in <i>The Paris Review.</i>

1301
01:11:52.498 --> 01:11:54.634
and I'm working on
some new material.

1302
01:11:54.667 --> 01:11:57.604
Uh. well. we'd be happy to
take look at your material

1303
01:11:57.636 --> 01:11:58.871
when you feel it's ready.

1304
01:11:59.972 --> 01:12:01.240
That would be great.

1305
01:12:01.274 --> 01:12:02.909
That would be
really great. yeah.

1306
01:12:02.942 --> 01:12:03.976
Let's cheers to that.

1307
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:05.645
OK!

1308
01:12:05.677 --> 01:12:07.948
Well. the satirical
stuff. I like.

1309
01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.550
I know. but <i>The New Yorker's</i>
fiction is a joke.

1310
01:12:10.582 --> 01:12:12.652
And that soppy
"Talk of the Town" thing?

1311
01:12:14.153 --> 01:12:15.155
Don...

1312
01:12:15.188 --> 01:12:16.489
Oh. I'm sorry.

1313
01:12:16.523 --> 01:12:18.190
I know you love
that shit. that...

1314
01:12:18.224 --> 01:12:21.561
"Oh. let's all
go meet up at the Algonquin.

1315
01:12:21.594 --> 01:12:24.163
I do so wish you could
join us." bullshit.

1316
01:12:27.634 --> 01:12:28.935
So when's the wedding?

1317
01:12:33.706 --> 01:12:37.711
It's. uh. it's Columbus Day
weekend. right?

1318
01:12:37.743 --> 01:12:40.546
Or... or am I making...
am I making that up?

1319
01:12:40.579 --> 01:12:42.849
It's next weekend. Don.

1320
01:12:42.881 --> 01:12:44.518
Joanna. you're
coming. right?

1321
01:12:44.551 --> 01:12:45.686
Yeah. yeah...

1322
01:12:46.719 --> 01:12:47.855
Excited!

1323
01:12:50.823 --> 01:12:53.560
You're an asshole.
You know that. right?

1324
01:12:53.592 --> 01:12:55.061
Uh...

1325
01:12:57.564 --> 01:12:59.199
I knew that if
I told you about it.

1326
01:12:59.231 --> 01:13:00.233
you'd start planning.

1327
01:13:00.266 --> 01:13:03.135
like: "Let's rent a car.
Let's stay in this B&B.

1328
01:13:03.168 --> 01:13:04.436
What am I gonna wear?"

1329
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:07.306
And then you'd buy that dress
and you'd make all these plans.

1330
01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:08.807
and then you flip out at me

1331
01:13:08.841 --> 01:13:10.644
when I told you that
I wanted to go alone.

1332
01:13:14.212 --> 01:13:17.182
You wanna go to your
best friend's wedding alone?

1333
01:13:17.216 --> 01:13:18.284
OK. listen.

1334
01:13:18.317 --> 01:13:20.753
I don't need to justify
myself to you. all right?

1335
01:13:20.787 --> 01:13:21.788
Really?

1336
01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:22.689
Really. Buba!

1337
01:13:22.721 --> 01:13:24.791
All my bros from
Hartford will be there.

1338
01:13:24.823 --> 01:13:26.156
It's gonna be
the end of an era.

1339
01:13:26.158 --> 01:13:28.027
And I don't want to
have to worry

1340
01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:30.296
about whether you're
having fun or not.

1341
01:13:34.033 --> 01:13:35.802
Right!

1342
01:13:35.835 --> 01:13:38.038
Maybe you'll meet
some hot blonde

1343
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:39.872
that wants you to
rip her panties off

1344
01:13:39.905 --> 01:13:40.774
and fuck her up the ass

1345
01:13:40.806 --> 01:13:42.809
and write an unreadable
story about her!

1346
01:13:43.876 --> 01:13:45.011
What? Wow!

1347
01:13:45.043 --> 01:13:46.613
Where is this coming from?

1348
01:13:46.645 --> 01:13:48.814
Where is the sweet. naive
girl I met last Christmas?

1349
01:13:48.847 --> 01:13:49.849
'Cause you know what?

1350
01:13:49.881 --> 01:13:51.585
I'd like her back.
please. Buba.

1351
01:13:51.618 --> 01:13:54.220
Stop calling me Buba. OK?
I'm not a child!

1352
01:13:54.252 --> 01:13:57.256
I call you Buba
because I love you.

1353
01:13:57.289 --> 01:13:59.826
It's what my grandmother
calls my mom.

1354
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:03.028
You love me?

1355
01:14:03.061 --> 01:14:04.096
Of course!

1356
01:14:05.264 --> 01:14:07.034
I mean. would I
be here if I didn't?

1357
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.337
I told you I've never lived with
a girl before. You changed me.

1358
01:14:13.739 --> 01:14:15.140
You love me.

1359
01:14:15.173 --> 01:14:17.377
but you don't want to me
to go to Mark's wedding?

1360
01:14:17.409 --> 01:14:18.811
Correct.

1361
01:14:26.252 --> 01:14:28.622
Look. I am
older than you.

1362
01:14:28.654 --> 01:14:30.724
I try not to remind you
of this. but it is true.

1363
01:14:30.756 --> 01:14:31.790
All right?

1364
01:14:31.823 --> 01:14:33.192
And one day.
when you're my age.

1365
01:14:33.225 --> 01:14:35.628
you'll realize that
two people can love each other

1366
01:14:35.662 --> 01:14:36.829
and not agree
on everything

1367
01:14:36.863 --> 01:14:39.365
and not have to
do everything together.

1368
01:14:55.081 --> 01:14:57.083
You think I should
pack a tie?

1369
01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.690
Buba? You're good
with this kind of thing.

1370
01:15:03.722 --> 01:15:05.358
Like. I don't have a suit.

1371
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:09.328
so you think... you think
just a shirt and a tie?

1372
01:15:11.764 --> 01:15:13.100
You're depressed.

1373
01:15:14.766 --> 01:15:18.104
I swear. I mean.
I... I recognize the symptoms.

1374
01:15:18.136 --> 01:15:20.372
I get like that
when I'm emotional.

1375
01:15:20.405 --> 01:15:24.077
And. well. I can
get quite emotional.

1376
01:15:25.177 --> 01:15:26.412
I'm not depressed.

1377
01:15:26.445 --> 01:15:28.180
Hmm.

1378
01:15:28.213 --> 01:15:30.449
I'm a very happy person.

1379
01:15:30.483 --> 01:15:31.985
What?

1380
01:15:33.118 --> 01:15:34.654
Nothing.

1381
01:15:39.759 --> 01:15:41.828
Am I gonna get
a kiss goodbye?

1382
01:15:50.136 --> 01:15:53.006
All right. Goodbye. Joanna!

1383
01:16:24.302 --> 01:16:27.039
<i>"I think about Holden a lot.</i>

1384
01:16:27.073 --> 01:16:31.010

I get a stupid grin on my face.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:22.560
I suppose that...

1396
01:17:24.363 --> 01:17:28.802
I too can get quite emotional
about things sometimes.

1397
01:17:31.237 --> 01:17:32.471
But you're right.

1398
01:17:33.605 --> 01:17:36.341
You can't go around revealing
your goddamn emotions

1399
01:17:36.375 --> 01:17:37.310
to the world.

1400
01:17:38.944 --> 01:17:41.847
But if you can't reveal
your emotions to the world.

1401
01:17:41.881 --> 01:17:43.817
then what are you
supposed to do with them?

1402
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:45.519
How do you go on?

1403
01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:48.922
'Cause...

1404
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:53.425
I feel like
crying all the time.

1405
01:18:43.442 --> 01:18:45.645
Joanna? What is it?

1406
01:18:45.677 --> 01:18:47.546
Has something happened
at the agency?

1407
01:18:47.579 --> 01:18:49.515
No. no. no!
Everything's fine.

1408
01:18:50.917 --> 01:18:54.454
I brought you these
and some soup from Mangia.

1409
01:18:54.487 --> 01:18:56.288
I know you like
their mushroom barley.

1410
01:18:57.422 --> 01:18:59.091
That's very thoughtful.

1411
01:19:00.259 --> 01:19:01.627
You do pay attention. don't you?

1412
01:19:16.042 --> 01:19:19.179
You did a fine job
on those contracts.

1413
01:19:20.279 --> 01:19:22.916
Those electronic clauses.

1414
01:19:22.948 --> 01:19:25.618
they'll be the
death of publishing.

1415
01:19:28.186 --> 01:19:31.123
On the other hand.
engaging with Jerry's fans

1416
01:19:31.157 --> 01:19:33.592
was irresponsible.
immature and dangerous.

1417
01:19:33.626 --> 01:19:35.328
You know about that?

1418
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.329
I have fired
assistants for less.

1419
01:19:38.698 --> 01:19:40.667
Why didn't you fire me?

1420
01:19:40.699 --> 01:19:42.635
Because it's
highly unlikely

1421
01:19:42.667 --> 01:19:45.137
you will make
the same mistake twice.

1422
01:19:45.171 --> 01:19:47.106
Also. Jerry likes you.

1423
01:19:47.139 --> 01:19:49.708
I am reluctant
to alter his routine.

1424
01:19:49.742 --> 01:19:51.677
I don't want to
be a routine.

1425
01:19:56.983 --> 01:19:58.318
I. uh...

1426
01:19:59.452 --> 01:20:01.588
I have a couple of stories...

1427
01:20:02.688 --> 01:20:05.458
from long-term clients.

1428
01:20:05.490 --> 01:20:08.194
Read them.

1429
01:20:08.226 --> 01:20:11.497
and. uh. figure out which
magazines they'd be right for

1430
01:20:11.529 --> 01:20:13.432
and send them out.

1431
01:20:19.171 --> 01:20:20.707
What if I don't like them?

1432
01:20:20.739 --> 01:20:22.608
Then it's your job
to figure out who will.

1433
01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.277
Right.

1434
01:20:25.511 --> 01:20:27.047
Thank you.

1435
01:20:29.215 --> 01:20:31.384
Better get back
to the office.

1436
01:20:31.417 --> 01:20:33.620
Why do you think
Judy Blume left?

1437
01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:37.056
I'm sorry that
I said that.

1438
01:20:37.088 --> 01:20:41.327
No. please. I would like
to know what you think.

1439
01:20:52.238 --> 01:20:57.176
When you met with Judy.
did you discuss her writing?

1440
01:20:57.208 --> 01:21:00.980
The quality of her writing
was never an issue.

1441
01:21:02.515 --> 01:21:05.985
Maybe she wasn't looking
for the perfect sales pitch.

1442
01:21:07.319 --> 01:21:09.189
Maybe she just wanted...

1443
01:21:10.588 --> 01:21:13.292
to hear what you
thought about the story.

1444
01:21:13.324 --> 01:21:15.260
what it meant to you.

1445
01:21:17.128 --> 01:21:20.065
Or if you love books the
same way that she loves them.

1446
01:21:21.434 --> 01:21:24.704
I'm not sure my love of books
was relevant to that discussion.

1447
01:21:24.737 --> 01:21:27.440
Maybe it was
relevant to her.

1448
01:21:30.676 --> 01:21:32.612
I know it would be to me.

1449
01:21:34.145 --> 01:21:35.514
Oh...

1450
01:21:38.516 --> 01:21:42.587
You know. I sold my first book
when I was in my 20s.

1451
01:21:42.621 --> 01:21:45.557
It was about this
young woman journalist

1452
01:21:45.591 --> 01:21:47.460
in the Spanish Civil War.

1453
01:21:47.493 --> 01:21:49.662
and it was actually
written by a man.

1454
01:21:50.863 --> 01:21:54.700
And yet he seemed to
understand intimately

1455
01:21:54.733 --> 01:21:57.136
what it would be like
for her as a woman.

1456
01:21:57.168 --> 01:22:01.073
Anyway. I sold the book.

1457
01:22:01.106 --> 01:22:05.444
And then my boss said that I
should represent the author.

1458
01:22:05.478 --> 01:22:07.747
And naturally.
I said yes.

1459
01:22:07.779 --> 01:22:11.750
And then. like. right away.
I started to get nervous.

1460
01:22:11.783 --> 01:22:13.786
almost panicky.

1461
01:22:13.819 --> 01:22:15.221
And what if...

1462
01:22:16.488 --> 01:22:19.558
what if the author
disappointed me as a person?

1463
01:22:19.591 --> 01:22:22.429
And what if I liked
the writing. but not him?

1464
01:22:24.563 --> 01:22:26.865
And it was about
3 weeks later.

1465
01:22:26.899 --> 01:22:29.569
we met for lunch
at Elaine's.

1466
01:22:29.601 --> 01:22:33.273
And at 9:00 p.m..
we were still there.

1467
01:22:34.472 --> 01:22:38.743
Yeah. just laughing
and talking and. yeah.

1468
01:22:38.777 --> 01:22:43.216
sharing our aspirations
and our... our love of music...

1469
01:22:44.315 --> 01:22:46.685
our love of books.

1470
01:22:49.421 --> 01:22:50.690
Daniel?

1471
01:22:52.791 --> 01:22:56.462
Yeah. Daniel.

1472
01:23:05.371 --> 01:23:07.873
My condolences. Margaret.

1473
01:23:07.907 --> 01:23:10.476
I'll pull my socks up.

1474
01:23:14.646 --> 01:23:16.483
Oh!

1475
01:23:55.688 --> 01:23:58.791
<i>For months. I had been
touched by anonymous fans.</i>

1476
01:23:58.823 --> 01:24:02.628
<i>touched by their desire
to connect with Salinger.</i>

1477
01:24:04.762 --> 01:24:07.399
<i>Their letters had changed me.</i>

1478
01:24:10.002 --> 01:24:13.773
<i>The time had come to see
for myself what had moved them.</i>

1479
01:24:29.787 --> 01:24:34.593
<i>Salinger's nothing
like I thought. Nothing.</i>

1480
01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:40.733
<i>He's brutal. brutal and funny.
and I love it.</i>

1481
01:24:40.765 --> 01:24:43.835
<i>I love</i> Franny <i>the most.</i>

1482
01:24:43.868 --> 01:24:46.572
<i>There's that moment
when the guy in Princeton</i>

1483
01:24:46.604 --> 01:24:48.673
<i>is waiting for Franny
at the train station.</i>

1484
01:24:48.707 --> 01:24:52.278
<i>and he has the letter
in his pocket. Franny's letter.</i>

1485
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:54.746
<i>And he's read it
a thousand times.</i>

1486
01:24:54.779 --> 01:24:56.782
<i>He knows it by heart.</i>

1487
01:24:56.814 --> 01:24:59.884
<i>but when she gets
off the train and asks.</i>

1488
01:24:59.917 --> 01:25:01.554
<i>"Did you get my letter."</i>

1489
01:25:01.587 --> 01:25:02.989
<i>he says...</i>

1490
01:25:03.021 --> 01:25:04.524
Which letter?

1491
01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:04.376
Hey. Buba!

1492
01:27:05.944 --> 01:27:07.613
I thought you'd be at work.

1493
01:27:08.747 --> 01:27:11.150
I took the morning off.

1494
01:27:11.182 --> 01:27:14.086
You know.
I missed you. Buba.

1495
01:27:14.118 --> 01:27:15.755
Hmm?

1496
01:27:26.064 --> 01:27:28.000
Are you going somewhere?

1497
01:27:29.734 --> 01:27:31.703
I'm leaving you. Don.

1498
01:27:35.873 --> 01:27:37.076
Y...

1499
01:27:37.109 --> 01:27:38.844
I get it! This is
about the wedding!

1500
01:27:38.877 --> 01:27:40.613
Something hit me
while you were gone.

1501
01:27:40.645 --> 01:27:42.614
Why are you making
a thing out of this?

1502
01:27:42.648 --> 01:27:44.817
Listen to me. something
hit me while you were gone!

1503
01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:46.552
What. that you
never really engaged?

1504
01:27:46.585 --> 01:27:48.020
- I didn't miss you.
- What?

1505
01:27:48.052 --> 01:27:50.422
I didn't think about you.
not for one second.

1506
01:27:51.856 --> 01:27:54.193
OK. so you needed some time
on your own. I get that.

1507
01:27:54.225 --> 01:27:56.060
You can keep
the apartment. all right?

1508
01:27:56.094 --> 01:27:57.462
You need it
more than I do.

1509
01:27:57.496 --> 01:27:58.697
So you're gonna give me

1510
01:27:58.729 --> 01:28:00.799
the. "Sorry. it's not you.
it's me." bullshit?

1511
01:28:00.832 --> 01:28:03.001
I should have broke up
with you before.

1512
01:28:03.034 --> 01:28:04.936
I'm not in love with you.

1513
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:06.139
I'm sorry.

1514
01:28:38.237 --> 01:28:39.204
Thanks.

1515
01:29:56.914 --> 01:29:58.617
I knew you could do it!

1516
01:29:59.717 --> 01:30:01.720
I knew it! Come with me!

1517
01:30:01.752 --> 01:30:05.223
Hugh! Stop doing
what you're doing!

1518
01:30:05.256 --> 01:30:07.659
Max. we're coming
into your sanctum!

1519
01:30:07.693 --> 01:30:09.228
I have an announcement to make!

1520
01:30:09.261 --> 01:30:10.296
What is it?

1521
01:30:10.328 --> 01:30:13.765
Joanna has sold a story
I gave her this summer.

1522
01:30:13.798 --> 01:30:17.002
- Congratulations!
- Oh! Not surprised! Good job!

1523
01:30:17.034 --> 01:30:19.203
- You're on your way.
- Of course she is!

1524
01:30:19.237 --> 01:30:21.673
I knew the moment you
walked through the door

1525
01:30:21.707 --> 01:30:23.742
that you were
agency material.

1526
01:30:23.774 --> 01:30:26.978
Now you can start to build
your very own client list.

1527
01:30:27.011 --> 01:30:29.148
a most exciting
feeling for an agent.

1528
01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:30.682
Isn't that right. Max?

1529
01:30:30.716 --> 01:30:32.918
For once. I have to
agree with Margaret. yes.

1530
01:30:32.951 --> 01:30:34.886
We will celebrate at lunch.

1531
01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.622
Hope you
like martinis!

1532
01:30:36.654 --> 01:30:38.925
- Oh. she'll learn to like them.
- There you go!

1533
01:31:17.695 --> 01:31:19.797
You know. we have
some authors

1534
01:31:19.831 --> 01:31:22.368
who would prefer to
be with you. I think.

1535
01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.369
than an old fogey like me.

1536
01:31:25.737 --> 01:31:27.672
Some people I
think you'll like.

1537
01:31:29.908 --> 01:31:31.143
What is it?

1538
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:36.215
I'm so grateful.
I'm so. so grateful.

1539
01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:42.887
You're leaving.

1540
01:31:44.088 --> 01:31:46.792
I was planning on talking
to you some time this week.

1541
01:31:46.824 --> 01:31:48.793
But you're doing so well!

1542
01:31:48.827 --> 01:31:53.666
I mean. you have it in you to
become a really fine agent.

1543
01:31:53.698 --> 01:31:56.969
You have good instincts.
a good heart.

1544
01:31:57.002 --> 01:31:58.738
Thank you.

1545
01:32:00.037 --> 01:32:01.706
Thank you. Margaret.

1546
01:32:03.375 --> 01:32:05.144
My mind's made up.

1547
01:32:06.478 --> 01:32:10.015
Of course. I'll stay until
you can find a replacement.

1548
01:32:12.717 --> 01:32:14.920
You have other aspirations.

1549
01:32:15.987 --> 01:32:18.056
I do.

1550
01:32:19.291 --> 01:32:22.261
We just never really
talked about anything

1551
01:32:22.293 --> 01:32:25.197
other than the
agency's business.

1552
01:32:26.765 --> 01:32:28.267
That's very true.

1553
01:32:34.472 --> 01:32:36.442
But I like working with you.

1554
01:32:36.475 --> 01:32:39.812
I like working here.
I really. really do.

1555
01:32:41.145 --> 01:32:45.417
There's just other things
I wanna do. and...

1556
01:32:47.051 --> 01:32:49.921
I'm afraid that if I don't
do them now. I never will.

1557
01:32:54.792 --> 01:32:56.295
I understand.

1558
01:34:01.259 --> 01:34:06.198
Hi! Kevin told me to
drop this by at my convenience.

1559
01:34:06.230 --> 01:34:09.801
Would you like to give it to
him yourself? I think he's in.

1560
01:34:09.835 --> 01:34:12.203
That would be lovely. Thanks.

1561
01:34:22.581 --> 01:34:24.516
You like Japanese?
Oh. hey there!

1562
01:34:24.548 --> 01:34:27.118
Oh. um. guess
who's visiting?

1563
01:34:33.425 --> 01:34:35.860
I want to
give us enough time.

1564
01:34:35.894 --> 01:34:37.296
I wonder about the cover.

1565
01:34:37.328 --> 01:34:39.030
The cover.

1566
01:34:39.064 --> 01:34:40.966
Yes. What do you make of it?

1567
01:34:40.998 --> 01:34:41.934
I don't think...

1568
01:34:52.444 --> 01:34:53.979
<i>Hello?</i>

1569
01:34:54.011 --> 01:34:55.380
Listen. I'm thinking.

1570
01:34:55.412 --> 01:34:57.448
If I was the guy
who put myself on a paper

1571
01:34:57.481 --> 01:34:59.350
and it came out as
<i>Catcher in the Rye.</i>

1572
01:34:59.384 --> 01:35:02.020
I'd get a bang out of the
bastard writing me a letter

1573
01:35:02.052 --> 01:35:03.889
pretending to be
able to do the same.

1574
01:35:03.921 --> 01:35:05.122
You follow me?

1575
01:35:50.368 --> 01:35:52.437
...chestnut stuffing.

1576
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:54.640
Oh. Jerry?

1577
01:35:54.672 --> 01:35:57.341
- May I introduce you to...
- Joanna!

1578
01:35:57.375 --> 01:35:59.478
So good to finally meet you.
