6
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.213
To our new friend. welcome.

7
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.793
This is your souvenir.

8
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.303
Yesterday.

9
00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:04.228
I don't want it.

10
00:01:04.278 --> 00:01:06.105
This is like the last person...

11
00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:11.056
I wanna be...

12
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.910
Hello.

13
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.790
My name is Antigone Corday.

14
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.930
I am Jeremiah Corday's sister.

15
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.620
And I have some very upsetting news.

16
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.700
Yesterday. my brother Jeremiah died.

17
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.293
He was my best friend.

18
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.963
He taught me everything.

19
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.000
My heart is broken. but
I can't just sit here and

20
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.280
waste away and do nothing.

21
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.260
Jeremiah would kill me.

22
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.650
As much as he meant to me.

23
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.683
he meant even more to you.

24
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.375
And the causes he fought for.

25
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.330
He gave important ideas a global platform.

26
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.770
So in order to keep his legacy alive.

27
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.830
I'm going to continue
uploading to his channel.

28
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.040
His causes are mine
and his spirit is mine now.

29
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.970
Jeremiah always used
to say we'll never end evil

30
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.070
and will never end oppression.

31
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.300
But what remains and
what rises into the ether

32
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.113
and becomes immortal. in his words.

33
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.100
is the way in which we bring light

34
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.620
and goodness into this world.

35
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.410
The impact is really real. y'all.

36
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.910
The impact is there.

37
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.063
And so that's what I'm doing.

38
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.770
Or at least that's what
I'm gonna try to do.

39
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.200
because that's what Jeremiah was about.

40
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.530
And that is the most admirable thing

41
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.030
that I can take with me through my life

42
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.373
and teach my kid.

43
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.690
But you know what. I thought.

44
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.840
like. what can I bring to his legacy

45
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.983
that would make him maybe even more human?

46
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.610
So I found this.

47
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.759
It's a never before
seen clip. an exclusive.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.903

'Cause it's his-

66
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.494
You want a big piece
or a small piece. dad?

67
00:04:11.544 --> 00:04:12.335
A big piece.

68
00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.160
Okay.

69
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.470
Don't give him too big.

70
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.053
Let's use our fork. dad.

71
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.873
Take that. look.

72
00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:20.780
Can you
actually also wipe his face?

73
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.030
I am. I am.

74
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.070
He's actually not doing too. too bad.

75
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.903
Use your fork.

76
00:04:24.953 --> 00:04:26.153
Yeah. yeah. yeah. that's good.

77
00:04:27.673 --> 00:04:29.140
So.

78
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.640
what does the future hold in store

79
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.880
for the legendary firebrand

80
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.895
Jeremiah Corday?

81
00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:35.980
Did you just say firebrand?

82
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.810
I did. what do
you have to say about it?

83
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.643
Yeah.

84
00:04:38.693 --> 00:04:39.476
A rebel.

85
00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:40.690
I'm an icon.

86
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.072
That's true.

87
00:04:42.122 --> 00:04:43.234
I'm a sex symbol.

88
00:04:43.284 --> 00:04:44.067
Ew. stop.

89
00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.020
I feel like it's time
for a rebrand for me.

90
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.415
What do you think?

91
00:04:48.465 --> 00:04:50.050
Okay. say more.

92
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.198
I've just been thinking that it's

93
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.950
like. a good time to sell out.

94
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.840
The market is ready for me to sell out.

95
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.610
Jeremiah's selling out.

96
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.331
You've heard it here first. folks.

97
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:00.172
I'm gonna become a neoliberal shit head.

98
00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:01.832
What do you think?

99
00:05:01.882 --> 00:05:02.665
Ugh. dad.

100
00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:03.820
I'm saying. like. get my ass

101
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.040
into a room with some lobbyists.

102
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.720
Get me a house in the Hamptons. baby.

103
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.830
It's time to sell out.

104
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.920
It's time to make this money.

105
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.096
Okay.

106
00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:12.929
Okay?

107
00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.574
Okay.

108
00:05:14.624 --> 00:05:16.098
Could you imagine if
I could actually do that

109
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.860
with a straight face?

110
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.297
You'd get elected.

111
00:05:19.347 --> 00:05:20.625
I'd get elected. yes.

112
00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:22.511
I would be
your. you know. obviously...

113
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:23.637
First sister.

114
00:05:23.687 --> 00:05:24.738
Yeah. first sister.

115
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.530
I guess we'll just have
to settle for another year

116
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.621
of trying to change the world.

117
00:05:46.825 --> 00:05:48.490
Ugh. I thought it would clear things up

118
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.440
because Jeremiah always used to say

119
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.130
that misinformation was a plague.

120
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.611
especially during Trump. and especially.

121
00:05:57.661 --> 00:05:59.670
ugh. especially during COVID.

122
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.320
So you guys. once and for all.

123
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.570
Jeremiah was not murdered.

124
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.740
He had an old car and the brakes were bad.

125
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.400
And we always told
him. "Fix your car. dude."

126
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.150
He never did. because of
course he had better things to do.

127
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.030
And so one night it was raining

128
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.580
and he hydroplaned and he died.

129
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.110
There was a fire.

130
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.350
I know that it's the internet
and you trolls be trolling.

131
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.710
But please. please just stop.

132
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.360
Just imagine if it was you.

133
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.793
And your family. your
brother. your best friend.

134
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.800
And imagine that all you
had to go on was teeth.

135
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.210
Hi daddy.

136
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.160
You need help?

137
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.993
No. no. no. - Come-

138
00:06:45.043 --> 00:06:45.826
No. I'm good.

139
00:06:45.876 --> 00:06:46.659
I'm good.

140
00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:47.492
Are you sure?

141
00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:48.375
Yeah. don't get up.

142
00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:53.333
Okay.

143
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.323
What?

144
00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:56.728
There's a mess.

145
00:06:56.778 --> 00:06:58.540
That's okay.

146
00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.920
A spill.

147
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.053
I'll clean it up.

148
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.143
What am I here for. daddy?

149
00:07:05.715 --> 00:07:06.513
I'm bugging you.

150
00:07:06.563 --> 00:07:07.863
No. no. I'm done.

151
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.260
Where's Jeremiah?

152
00:07:14.688 --> 00:07:15.621
Ugh.

153
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.080
Joining us now is Antigone Corday.

154
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.700
Antigone. it goes without saying.

155
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.450
but I gotta say it: that everyone here is.

156
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.260
we're devastated. And we're so. so sorry.

157
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.093
Thank you.

158
00:07:33.143 --> 00:07:36.070
Jeremiah meant so much
to each and every one of us.

159
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.320
and I absolutely loved him.

160
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.350
And I'm sure most of
my viewers know this...

161
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.920
The illustrious career of
Jeremiah Corday began

162
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.330
when he was a lowly intern
on the Tim Remus Show.

163
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.390
And we were a tiny operation at the time.

164
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.580
He loved the show. and he kept emailing me.

165
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.630
and he wouldn't stop.

166
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.207
And one day he shows up at
the office with his bag. says.

167
00:07:59.257 --> 00:08:00.587
"I drove all the way from Tulsa."

168
00:08:00.637 --> 00:08:02.027
"and you don't have to pay me."

169
00:08:02.077 --> 00:08:02.957
"I'll work for free."

170
00:08:03.007 --> 00:08:05.410
"I just want to be a journalist."

171
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.660
which is trademark Jeremiah.

172
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.130
From the moment I saw the guy.

173
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.420
from the moment he opened his mouth.

174
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.670
I could tell this person was remarkable.

175
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.660
He was extraordinary.

176
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.910
You know. half the time
he knew more than I did.

177
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.920
And so pretty soon he was working here.

178
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.290
And pretty soon he was
pitching stories. and of course.

179
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.540
because he's Jeremiah.
they were incredible.

180
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.880
The first video we ever did

181
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.430
that crossed two million
views. was one he pitched.

182
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.013
Oh. I remember that.

183
00:08:29.063 --> 00:08:32.320
Oh. that was such an amazing time for us.

184
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.500
That was what. like. six years ago now?

185
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.150
Yeah. yeah. that's right.

186
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.983
But you know what?

187
00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:42.700
He was about to quit
politics before he came to you.

188
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.900
So. seriously. thank you.

189
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.690
You saved his life.

190
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.380
Well. Antigone. thank you so much.

191
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.090
He had this. this shit job.

192
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.130
He had a master's degree and he was working

193
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.750
at a restaurant as a host.

194
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.740
Wow. - You know. he.

195
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.350
he was putting all of
his energy into that job.

196
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.310
and he had no time to
do the research he wanted

197
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.590
or do the social media push

198
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.710
that would really create him a platform.

199
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.700
And you know what?

200
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.813
He was... He was so charming.

201
00:09:10.863 --> 00:09:14.200
And he was so magnetic.
and damn. he was brilliant.

202
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.163
Right. you know?

203
00:09:15.213 --> 00:09:17.200
So we talked about it. and I said.

204
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.040
"Why don't you just go. go to Tim?"

205
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.933
And so he did. and. you know.

206
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.030
all the rest is... - The rest is history.

207
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.350
Absolutely.

208
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.060
So we've put together a
little reel of Jeremiah's work.

209
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.273
some from my show. some from his show.

210
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.513
Just some classics. you know?

211
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.120
And I have to warn you. if
you're new to Jeremiah's work.

212
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.920
that this will not come
close to capturing his impact.

213
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.713
his wisdom. his humor.
his extraordinary insight.

214
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.070
But I hope it'll give you an idea.

215
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.163
So let's roll the clip.

216
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.310
I'm just saying. compared
to fuckin' Hillary Clinton.

217
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.370
Bill Cosby is basically Mother Teresa.

218
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.210
Whoa.

219
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.440
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

220
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.798
Tell me I'm wrong.
you know that I'm right.

221
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.020
Okay. you know what?

222
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.270
It's just... elaborate

223
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.410
uh. please? - Okay. I mean.

224
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.780
first of all. she's a fucking war criminal.

225
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.167
Right. look at Libya.

226
00:10:21.217 --> 00:10:22.312
That. well. it's just uh-

227
00:10:22.354 --> 00:10:24.160
And you know that I hate President Trump.

228
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.450
Well. that makes two of us.

229
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.250
Well. when he said that she started

230
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.350
ISIS. I lost my shit.

231
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.560
I mean. they march in there extralegally

232
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.833
and destabilize the entire region.

233
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.690
I mean. you can't
argue with that one. right?

234
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.350
I mean. Gaddafi was a
monster. but compared to ISIS?

235
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.750
Compared to ISIS. he's Mother Teresa.

236
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.890
He's Bill Cosby.

237
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.140
He's Bill Cosby.

238
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.570
Thank
you. our first question?

239
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.680
Alright. yes.

240
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.830
Madam Vice President. you
and President Biden campaigned

241
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.000
on a platform of unity and equality.

242
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.160
Time and time again. you
specifically called attention

243
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:05.163
to the inhumane camps
at the US-Mexico border.

244
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.970
As of right now. there
are more people detained

245
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.580
in those camps than at any time

246
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.800
during President Trump's tenure.

247
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.120
How long will you stand
on black and brown bodies

248
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.693
to further your own ambitions?

249
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.200
I guess as a followup
question. I would love to know.

250
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.933
how can you sleep at night?

251
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.030
Jeremy. lemme tell you something.

252
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.300
but yes. I will and I have before. listen.

253
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.700
The calls are getting louder and louder.

254
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.668
This is what I'm talking about.

255
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.880
Top Democrats from New
York to the White House.

256
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.370
calling on Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign.

257
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.440
Jeremiah Corday joins us now.

258
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.820
Jeremiah's a correspondent

259
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.010
with the Tim Remus Show on YouTube.

260
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:48.843
Thank you. Don.

261
00:11:48.893 --> 00:11:49.750
Thanks for having me on.

262
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.430
This is something that nobody

263
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.990
would've predicted last year.

264
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.420
It's pretty disappointing
and it's pretty shocking.

265
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:56.538
It's a shocking development. yes.

266
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.760
Shocking is the right word.

267
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.700
It was actually shocking
when he let thousands

268
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:04.383
of old people die last year.
and no one reported on it.

269
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.650
Sexual harassment is wrong
and it should not be tolerated.

270
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.470
It should be condemned
and punished and prosecuted.

271
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.170
But. you know. I think that
negligent homicide is kind

272
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.280
of a bigger deal here.

273
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.040
At best. it was negligent homicide.

274
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:22.150
You know. at worst. it's a
holocaust of grandmothers.

275
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.020
A...

276
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.210
a holocaust of grandmothers.

277
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.650
Jeremiah Corday.

278
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.810
Yeah. I was thinking that
maybe you should put that

279
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.403
on T-shirts and sell it.

280
00:12:30.453 --> 00:12:32.860
You know what. I'll give
you a cut of the merch.

281
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.080
I want a percentage if you sell

282
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.380
Holocaust of grandmother T-shirts.

283
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.780
Yeah. yeah.

284
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.910
Okay. I gotta ask. once
it was all said and done.

285
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.998
and once the interview was over.

286
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.600
like. how pissed were they?

287
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.890
Dude. they were so pissed. They...

288
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.190
I left the studio and walked
back to my dressing room.

289
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.200
and they had locked the door.

290
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.690
And they put all of
my shit in a plastic bag

291
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.370
and just dropped it at the door.

292
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.540
No one even talked to me.

293
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.810
I would say that that sounds like a hint.

294
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.870
Yeah. I don't think that
the people there like it

295
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.700
when you speak truth to power.

296
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:08.343
Okay. let's take a question
from the super chat.

297
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.490
Jeremiah. why are you so much harder

298
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.770
on the left than you are the right?

299
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:15.603
Wow.

300
00:13:15.653 --> 00:13:16.788
First of all. I love this question.

301
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.190
Thank you.

302
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.170
I'm not. I mean. I see
where you're coming from.

303
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.663
I am. I am more...

304
00:13:22.713 --> 00:13:24.910
I am more critical of the left.

305
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.743
I agree.

306
00:13:25.793 --> 00:13:27.520
But anybody with a brain to think.

307
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.470
anyone with a conscience
would agree with me

308
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.110
that the right is totally corrupt.

309
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.660
totally morally bankrupt at this point.

310
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:38.440
But my problem is that on the left. we love

311
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.300
to fancy ourselves as the party

312
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:44.710
that holds ourselves to
a higher moral standard.

313
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.750
I would love to think that a big part

314
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.260
of what I'm trying to do
is to present that standard

315
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.733
and to try and hold
these leaders accountable.

316
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.220
Because I do believe that
real change is possible.

317
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.390
Real actual human change is possible.

318
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.930
James Joyce once wrote
that history is a nightmare

319
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.600
from which I am trying to awake.

320
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.500
I love that.

321
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.410
I love that. I'm inspired by that.

322
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.580
If you really study it.
you'll see that our time

323
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.570
on this planet has been
nothing short of a horrible.

324
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:24.620
horrible nightmare with wars.
and diseases. and oppression.

325
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:29.320
But we're doing a whole lot
better than we used to be doing.

326
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.440
Human beings are in a
much better position now

327
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.550
than we were because enough people stood up

328
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.490
and raised their voices and
made something happen.

329
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.740
And when our time is
up and we pass that torch

330
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.260
to the next generation.
and they pass that torch

331
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.110
to the next generation.
and that generation passes it

332
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.900
to the next generation. then maybe.

333
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.650
just maybe in some
distant future. you know.

334
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.796
history can be a dream come true.

335
00:14:56.846 --> 00:14:59.560
Thank you so much.

336
00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:03.160
Jeremiah is. he's irreplaceable.

337
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:04.570
I know.

338
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.780
There's. there's a.
there's a. a. a spill.

339
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.230
I know. it's okay.

340
00:15:10.294 --> 00:15:11.085
Not right now.

341
00:15:11.127 --> 00:15:12.218
I'm so sorry.

342
00:15:12.268 --> 00:15:13.840
Oh. that's perfectly fine.

343
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.760
I'm so sorry. this seems like a good note

344
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:16.593
to end on. though.

345
00:15:16.643 --> 00:15:18.183
For sure. yeah. yeah.

346
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.380
I think. sorry. I think
your partner is still. uh.

347
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.870
Oh. that's not my partner. that's my dad.

348
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.186
I'm gonna be a single mom. so...

349
00:15:27.236 --> 00:15:28.750
I'm sorry. Eddie. hey!

350
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.250
How are you. Eddie?

351
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.080
Hey. it's been ages. how are you doing?

352
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.377
You look different. I didn't recognize you.

353
00:15:34.427 --> 00:15:36.190
Hi. Tim.

354
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.180
Hello. Eddie.

355
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:38.350
Yeah. he can't hear you.

356
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.875
but I'll send along the message.

357
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.070
This is not gonna be
me crying all the time.

358
00:15:52.969 --> 00:15:55.519
I have cried all day and
I'm really. really scared.

359
00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.100
And if this is a prank.
it is really fucked up.

360
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.933
Okay?

361
00:16:00.983 --> 00:16:02.373
Please just stop.

362
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.857
This showed up at my door today

363
00:16:05.907 --> 00:16:09.153
and it came with a camera.
which I'm using now.

364
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.540
and a laptop and this note.

365
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:18.590
And the note said to turn on
the laptop and film the camera.

366
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.880
Sorry. my brain is just
really going everywhere.

367
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.880
But.

368
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.310
the note said to turn on the laptop

369
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.480
and film the screen. and
I think it's just impossible.

370
00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.190
Or maybe I'm going crazy or something

371
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.593
but this is what was on it.

372
00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:47.538
Okay. so the note told me

373
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.880
to watch the video in here

374
00:16:49.997 --> 00:16:52.043
in case the house is bugged.

375
00:16:52.093 --> 00:16:54.120
The only thing on this laptop is the video.

376
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.473
so I guess let's watch it.

377
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.543
Hey. Antigone.

378
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.823
I'm alive.

379
00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:15.850
I'm so sorry for everything
that I've put you through.

380
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.650
I love you.

381
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.140
Please just trust that
this was the only way

382
00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.640
that things could happen.

383
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:22.523
Alright?

384
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.710
I'm in danger and you are in danger.

385
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.203
and dad's in danger.

386
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.480
I just watched your interview
with Tim. and I was so moved.

387
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.380
Thank you for your hope and
your optimism. and your heart.

388
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.913
I wish I had that hope right now.

389
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.003
But I don't.

390
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.370
Everything that I've been fighting for.

391
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.870
everything that I've been believing in

392
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.663
has been called into question.

393
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:04.113
Something terrible and
horrible is about to happen.

394
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.630
Worse than 9-11 or
COVID. or any of that shit.

395
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.240
Okay. but we can stop it. Antigone.

396
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.940
We can stop it. but we
have to work together.

397
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.823
Alright?

398
00:18:19.926 --> 00:18:21.276
I need you to listen to me.

399
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.663
Don't trust anyone.

400
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.603
alright? Don't talk to anyone.

401
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.850
Take that camera that I sent you

402
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.920
and record everything. alright?

403
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.390
I need you to record everything.

404
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.000
Don't use your phone. use the camera.

405
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.463
It's much more secure.

406
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.490
Reality is completely
upside down right now.

407
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.990
And I could explain everything to you.

408
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.760
but it would take five hours. and honestly.

409
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.380
it wouldn't make much of a difference.

410
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.730
But here's what we can do.

411
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.550
Take that camera. hit record. stand up.

412
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.130
walk to the window. point it to the sky.

413
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.540
Alright?

414
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.490
I'm gonna give you 40
seconds and then come back

415
00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.190
and watch the rest of this video.

416
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.150
If you're still looking at me
right now on this video. stop.

417
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.690
I'm telling you to stand up.
walk to the window and film.

418
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.323
This is a pre-recorded
video. it's not live.

419
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.940
So go and do it. okay?

420
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.823
I love you.

421
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.699
Trust me. go.

422
00:19:29.122 --> 00:19:32.018
Oh my gosh.

423
00:19:33.633 --> 00:19:34.716
What is that?

424
00:19:37.863 --> 00:19:38.696
Is that?

425
00:19:50.103 --> 00:19:51.520
Okay. okay. okay.

426
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.003
Pretty amazing. right?

427
00:19:57.594 --> 00:20:01.690
And before you ask. no. I'm
not on a spaceship. obviously.

428
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.123
I haven't been abducted.

429
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.530
I'm just trying to show you

430
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.660
that things are not what they seem.

431
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.113
Okay. and you can't trust anyone right now.

432
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.790
Things are about to
get very. very dangerous.

433
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.000
But you have a huge part
to play in all of this. okay?

434
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.450
I need you to keep doing
what you've been doing.

435
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.283
Alright?

436
00:20:23.333 --> 00:20:25.900
Keep giving interviews.
keep making YouTube videos.

437
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.340
Keep talking to people.

438
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.470
Mourn my loss. that's key.

439
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.910
It's important that people think

440
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.800
that I'm dead. alright.
you can't say anything

441
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.150
about this to anyone.

442
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.580
Don't tell anyone about this video.

443
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.570
And please. please do
not call the cops. alright?

444
00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.053
So many people that I
thought were my friends.

445
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.970
so many people that I
thought were my allies.

446
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.620
turned out not to be. they're...

447
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.520
And I know I sound crazy when I say this.

448
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.353
You fuckin'...

449
00:20:52.403 --> 00:20:55.270
You know that I hate conspiracies.

450
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.920
but a lot of these people are aligned

451
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.403
with forces that are fucking evil.

452
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.170
So just keep recording
everything. that's all we can do.

453
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.810
Make a document. record everything.

454
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.693
Alright?

455
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.508
The last thing I need
you to do is I need you

456
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.820
to go to my apartment.

457
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.620
You've got the keys.

458
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.290
Go inside. grab my laptop.

459
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.260
And there's a plastic bag in the tank

460
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.503
of the toilet in my bathroom.

461
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.510
Take that bag.

462
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.790
Don't watch the contents
that are inside of it.

463
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.623
Not yet. alright?

464
00:21:28.673 --> 00:21:30.093
Wait till you hear from me.

465
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.683
I love you so much.

466
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.565
Thank you for trusting me.

467
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.273
I'll be in touch soon.

468
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.610
What we're really seeing here is the dawn

469
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.120
of a post-human era. a time of ascendance

470
00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.673
for those deemed worthy.

471
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.310
And what makes someone worthy?

472
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.423
How does man or woman ascend to godhood?

473
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.943
I'm not talking about some
phony. Christian superstition.

474
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.250
If you wanna see. you
know. all the good that

475
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.200
thoughts and prayers have done.

476
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.360
you can go walk through a cemetery.

477
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:20.950
But there are gods.

478
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.880
They're real.

479
00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.130
The worthy have always known this.

480
00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.290
And you can look at sacrifice. you know.

481
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.280
as barbaric or primitive.
but that's just ignorant.

482
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.140
The god's demand sacrifice.

483
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:36.430
Because. I mean. there's a
whole lot that this accomplishes.

484
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.190
But. you know. one thing. although it's

485
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.880
not the main thing is
it draws their attention.

486
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.810
And it shows the gods that
the one performing the sacrifice

487
00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.090
is asking to be like them.

488
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.570
We're saying. you know.
"Let me into your club."

489
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.960
So that is. that's exactly
what we're telling them.

490
00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.450
And there's a ritual element. of course.

491
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.100
But. you know. sacrifice.

492
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:04.060
sacrifice can take. obviously.
a lot of different forms.

493
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.940
You can undermine and
you can. well. shift. you know.

494
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.940
power structures and topple governments.

495
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.400
So now you've created an environment. okay.

496
00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.920
where lots of people are going to die

497
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.050
and you get their attention.

498
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.080
You can take advantage
of a natural disaster

499
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.600
and march in there with a nonprofit

500
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.580
and funnel children away.

501
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.520
These kids. you know. are. they're orphans.

502
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.470
They're gonna die regardless.

503
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.133
But they can be used for a higher purpose.

504
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.280
Their purpose is to create a bridge.

505
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.183
is to open a line of communication.

506
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:44.935
Okay?

507
00:23:44.985 --> 00:23:46.193
What. what do you want me to do?

508
00:23:46.243 --> 00:23:48.790
I want you to smash it. daddy.

509
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:49.623
What?

510
00:23:49.673 --> 00:23:50.538
That computer right there.

511
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.400
You see?

512
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.465
Right in front of you?

513
00:23:52.515 --> 00:23:53.298
It's black.

514
00:23:53.348 --> 00:23:54.520
Yeah. you got it.

515
00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.850
You want me to break it with a hamper?

516
00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.118
Yes. I want you to smash

517
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.030
the living daylights out of it.

518
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.170
Why honey?

519
00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.700
Because it's my old laptop

520
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.670
and I'm getting a new one. and I need to.

521
00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.010
I need to destroy it so that
no one steals my identity.

522
00:24:10.893 --> 00:24:11.676
Oh god. hold on.

523
00:24:11.726 --> 00:24:15.077
Oh. yeah. you. you keep
going while I take this phone call.

524
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.440
Hello?

525
00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.140
Hi. is this Antigone Corday?

526
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:21.400
Yes. this is she.

527
00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.750
Who is this?

528
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.070
Hi. this is Jake Hernandez

529
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.300
with Lockridge & Associates.

530
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.040
Oh. hi.

531
00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.140
Oh my gosh. thank you so much

532
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.720
for the flowers Mark sent me. and the card.

533
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.783
It's so appreciated.

534
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.590
Oh. great. yeah.

535
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.547
I'll let him know.

536
00:24:36.597 --> 00:24:39.490
And all of us here are.
we're absolutely devastated.

537
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.020
Jeremiah is such a huge loss.

538
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.630
And please know that
you and your family are

539
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.890
in our thoughts right now.

540
00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.180
Yes. thank you. thank you.

541
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.220
I really appreciate that.

542
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.500
And well. so. listen.
Mark saw your interview

543
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.750
on Tim's show and we
saw what you were doing

544
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.230
with your channel. and we love it.

545
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.100
Wow. thank you.

546
00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.553
That's so nice of you to say.

547
00:24:58.603 --> 00:25:00.550
I really appreciate that.

548
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.770
Well. other people
have been watching too.

549
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.008
and they've been reaching out to us.

550
00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:07.960
And I think there are a
couple of opportunities.

551
00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:10.210
obviously. whenever you're ready.

552
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.108
Opportunities?

553
00:25:12.158 --> 00:25:13.720
So Mark would probably wanna talk

554
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:15.250
through the details with you.

555
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.091
And I'm really sorry bringing up business

556
00:25:16.133 --> 00:25:17.440
at a time like this.

557
00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:18.273
Oh. no. no.

558
00:25:18.323 --> 00:25:19.540
Please. please.

559
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:21.733
Business is all I wanna
think about. you trust me.

560
00:25:21.783 --> 00:25:24.883
It's a great distraction. so thank you.

561
00:25:24.933 --> 00:25:25.878
Well. there's something

562
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.470
that's a bit time sensitive.
and Mark let me know

563
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.220
that he could make himself available today.

564
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.053
Yeah. okay.

565
00:25:34.103 --> 00:25:36.398
Yeah. just let me know when and I'm there.

566
00:25:37.648 --> 00:25:38.560
Okay.

567
00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:43.610
So I am about to meet Mark
Bruce. Jeremiah's literary agent.

568
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.070
Jeremiah has a book coming

569
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:52.533
out later this year. or he had one.

570
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.910
But Mark says that he
has a surprise for me.

571
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.373
so I think I'm a little bit surprised out.

572
00:26:04.956 --> 00:26:06.400
But we'll see.

573
00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.770
So tell me. are you working on anything?

574
00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.510
Got anything in the pipe?

575
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.810
Oh. yeah. no. I'm...

576
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.930
Yes I'm. I have taken over
Jeremiah's channel. so I'm.

577
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.380
that's keeping me very busy
and I'm really grateful for that

578
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.853
because. oh boy. I don't know if I.

579
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.040
if I didn't have that
right now. I think I would

580
00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.950
just collapse and curl up into a ball.

581
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.093
and yeah. it's saving me.

582
00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.103
Yeah. I get that.

583
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.503
My son died last year.

584
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.180
Shot himself.

585
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.483
Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.

586
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.600
I know. everyone was. but I
mean. what else can you say?

587
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.560
Right?

588
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.987
Everyone's walking on eggshells around you

589
00:26:50.037 --> 00:26:51.813
and you just don't give a shit.

590
00:26:53.195 --> 00:26:56.200
Hmm. yeah. - Because

591
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.160
there's nothing anyone really can say.

592
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.310
There's no comfort. there's no consolation.

593
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.863
there's no fixing it.

594
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.410
I took two days to just
sob and sob. and sob.

595
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.010
and stare at the wall and
forget to take a shower.

596
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.343
And it was. it was killing me.

597
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:19.233
But the day of Harry's funeral. I worked.

598
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.260
It's probably because
it hadn't fully set in.

599
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:27.753
really. you know. and
I was just going crazy.

600
00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:30.550
Right. - And I hadn't processed it.

601
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.630
And I felt like I needed to work. I had to.

602
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.510
And it made me sane. it was therapeutic.

603
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.580
Yeah. no. I definitely understand that.

604
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.060
Were like kindred spirits there. for sure.

605
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:45.610
Well. if you need time.
just let me know. okay?

606
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.353
But I'm not gonna ask. 'cause
I hated it when they asked me.

607
00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.510
Sounds good. thank you.

608
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.280
Yeah. you're welcome.

609
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.453
So let's get down to business then?

610
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.650
Please. let's do it.

611
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.533
Okay.

612
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.380
So I saw you on Tim Remus.
and I've been watching

613
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.790
all the stuff you've been uploading.

614
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.040
you know. all of those Jeremiah clips

615
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.520
and especially the.

616
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.250
there was this one
clip. what was it called?

617
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.034
The Bill Cosby's Super Cut.

618
00:28:17.084 --> 00:28:17.917
Yes.

619
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:20.433
The Bill Cosby Super clit.

620
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.080
Yeah. I know.

621
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.116
I figure that the funny s-

622
00:28:24.166 --> 00:28:25.360
Oh man. he.

623
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.310
It's the funny stuff
that's so good right now

624
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.400
'cause it's like. uplifting. you know?

625
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:31.233
Yeah. that's right.

626
00:28:31.283 --> 00:28:32.976
He was so joyful.

627
00:28:33.026 --> 00:28:35.650
He really was.

628
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.790
Yeah.

629
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.573
So look. people have
been reaching out to me.

630
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.860
Everybody loved Jeremiah
and they loved the work he did.

631
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.290
They love your passion
and the work you're doing.

632
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.630
And they want to help you. I don't know.

633
00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.543
carry the torch. so to speak?

634
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.950
That's amazing.

635
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.020
Wow. where do we begin?

636
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:58.750
Well. first thing we gotta do is

637
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.090
get some big names on your channel. right?

638
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:05.913
And I think AOC has some
time available tomorrow.

639
00:29:07.476 --> 00:29:08.259
AOC?

640
00:29:08.309 --> 00:29:11.080
Wow. that would be actually incredible.

641
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.970
I mean. I would be super honored.

642
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:13.923
Yes. please.

643
00:29:13.973 --> 00:29:14.756
Yeah?

644
00:29:14.806 --> 00:29:15.589
Okay.

645
00:29:15.639 --> 00:29:16.450
That's great.

646
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.760
Told them that I would let them know.

647
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.773
So you're telling me you're
interested. I'll set it up.

648
00:29:22.823 --> 00:29:23.740
Okay? - Yes. I am.

649
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.030
Yes. thank you.

650
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.020
Wow. - Great. yeah.

651
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.913
No problem.

652
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.420
There's one more thing
I wanted to run by you.

653
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:36.040
Now. the timeline on this is
not super rushed or anything.

654
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.990
but obviously. we would like
to get this sooner than later.

655
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:44.350
So Jeremiah was a prolific writer. right?

656
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.390
We got his book. it's
pretty much finalized.

657
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.130
We're good there.

658
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.305
But his blog is huge.

659
00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:51.340
Right. yeah.

660
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.173
Right?

661
00:29:52.223 --> 00:29:53.140
Mm-hm. - I mean. there's

662
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.540
just years of content.

663
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.430
Of course. - We could.

664
00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.480
I don't know.

665
00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:02.380
compile it. curate it somewhere.

666
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:03.580
Uh-huh.

667
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:04.840
Right? - Okay. yeah.

668
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.983
I mean. we would love for
you to write the introduction.

669
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.190
Oh. I mean. yeah. I could try.

670
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.170
I mean. I'm definitely not the writer

671
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.500
that Jeremiah was. but yes. for sure.

672
00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:18.400
Yes.

673
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:19.600
Great. okay.

674
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.940
And you know. the
last time I talked to him.

675
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:25.330
he did mention he was
working on something new.

676
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.240
but didn't tell me what that was.

677
00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.493
Do you have any insight there?

678
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.390
Well. I will be going
through all of his stuff.

679
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.950
so if I find anything. I can
definitely send it your way.

680
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.783
Great. okay.

681
00:30:39.833 --> 00:30:41.680
That would be very helpful. thank you.

682
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:44.738
For sure.

683
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:50.013
So many folks. they have this.

684
00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:54.873
this mistaken conception
that war is a racket.

685
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.030
That's what the profane say. and it's.

686
00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.871
well. it's shortsighted.
and it's just about

687
00:30:58.913 --> 00:30:59.746
as old as history.

688
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.870
It's pretty old. but the
truth is older than history.

689
00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.600
They say. you know. war's
a means of making money

690
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:08.980
off the backs and the bodies.

691
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.160
and the blood of folks sent to fight.

692
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.370
And always they'll be similar speculation

693
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.133
on those stuck in the crosshairs.

694
00:31:18.578 --> 00:31:21.040
The innocent civilians. and so on.

695
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.200
Every bit of that is all just.

696
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.173
it's total stupidity and ignorance.

697
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.870
The worthy know that riches are ephemeral.

698
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.280
Human blood is so precious.
so very. very precious.

699
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:34.983
so much more precious than gold.

700
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.553
Money is illusion.

701
00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:43.060
The only lasting riches
are in transcendence.

702
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.633
And transcendence requires sacrifice.

703
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.893
Brick by brick. we're building a temple.

704
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.970
The builders have labored in
an unbroken line since the dawn

705
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.640
of thought on something enormous

706
00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.250
and glorious and final.

707
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.157
It is almost complete.

708
00:32:12.408 --> 00:32:13.191
Okay.

709
00:32:13.241 --> 00:32:14.903
So I just got to Jeremiah's apartment

710
00:32:14.953 --> 00:32:17.680
and I am freaking the fuck out.

711
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:18.563
Look.

712
00:32:21.726 --> 00:32:22.761
Okay-

713
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:24.812
Hey!

714
00:32:24.862 --> 00:32:25.891
Oh. hey. Antigone!

715
00:32:25.941 --> 00:32:27.018
Oh my god.
it's so good to see you.

716
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.510
Yeah. you're filming?

717
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.140
Oh yeah. I'm filming
a documentary on Jeremiah.

718
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.403
Oh. I didn't know I was
gonna be in the movies.

719
00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:36.828
Well. oh. sorry.

720
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.650
It's off. - It's fine.

721
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:39.600
It's totally fine.

722
00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.140
Look. I didn't want to
startle you about this. okay.

723
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:45.550
but someone called me to let me know

724
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.920
that Jeremiah's apartment was broken into.

725
00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.120
And I just had to run down here

726
00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:51.400
and make sure everything was still here.

727
00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:53.740
Oh. wow. that's.

728
00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.300
that's so nice of you.

729
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.530
You didn't have to do that.

730
00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.940
It's no problem at all.

731
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.350
You have so much on your plate.

732
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.780
I didn't want you to have
to worry about this. okay?

733
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.880
And. you know. I was gonna call the cops

734
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:04.728
and I just had to make sure.

735
00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.910
but everything is still here.

736
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.850
But if you find anything
of interest at all.

737
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:10.930
please let me know.

738
00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.348
Okay. yeah. I definitely will.

739
00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:13.240
Please. okay?

740
00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:14.560
Yes. I will.

741
00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.393
Awesome.

742
00:33:15.443 --> 00:33:17.530
Okay. well. I was just gonna go in there

743
00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.810
and check if there's any
articles of clothing I need

744
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.600
to bring to Goodwill or whatever.

745
00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:24.190
Understood.

746
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.660
Well. I'll leave you to it.

747
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:26.493
Okay.

748
00:33:26.543 --> 00:33:27.550
Good luck with your movie.

749
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.590
Are you fucking kidding me?

750
00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.120
Someone called you?

751
00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:31.960
Who?

752
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.550
So. what. you were intimately familiar

753
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.080
with the details of his apartment?

754
00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:36.640
Oh my god.

755
00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:38.320
Oh my god.

756
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.203
Wait.

757
00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.500
Where the fuck is his laptop?

758
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:45.383
Hey!

759
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.049
Hey.

760
00:33:51.916 --> 00:33:52.750
Hey.

761
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.620
Startled me. there.

762
00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.590
Oh my
gosh. I really apologize.

763
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.970
Totally fine. what's up?

764
00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.120
Oh. you told me to mention

765
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:02.380
if anything was missing

766
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.840
and actually. Jeremiah's laptop.

767
00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:05.680
Oh. wow.

768
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:07.210
Okay.

769
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.530
Did you see it?

770
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:13.240
It's a MacBook Pro. that
exact model. you know?

771
00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.390
Did you see it? - Um.

772
00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:19.000
I. I mean. I'm pretty
sure I would have noticed.

773
00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:22.240
but no. I didn't see anything anywhere.

774
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:23.320
Are you sure?

775
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.300
I mean. maybe it fell between the cushions

776
00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.380
of the couch or something.

777
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:29.023
But really. aye-yai-yai.
if somebody took that.

778
00:34:29.073 --> 00:34:31.360
I am so sorry.

779
00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:33.610
Oh. that's really okay.

780
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:37.653
Just. it looks exactly like that one.

781
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:42.460
Oh god. my brain is in a crazy
place because of Jeremiah.

782
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.610
and I'm just like. kind
of spiraling right now.

783
00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:49.810
So if you could just.
you're. you're totally sure.

784
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.740
I. yeah. but you know. if
you say it's just like this one.

785
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:58.090
I mean. I get it. but this one is mine.

786
00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.350
Oh yeah. no. of course.

787
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.183
I know it's yours.

788
00:35:00.233 --> 00:35:01.210
I didn't mean to imply that-

789
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.170
No. no. I'm sorry.

790
00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.003
No problem.

791
00:35:03.053 --> 00:35:04.390
I didn't mean it to come off that way.

792
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:08.200
What I mean to say is I
took it out of my briefcase

793
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.020
and went upstairs. and in
case I saw anything missing.

794
00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:13.510
I was gonna take some notes
or even shoot off an email.

795
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.440
You know what I mean?

796
00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:15.588
Oh yeah. I know what you mean.

797
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:16.503
Could you check?

798
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.950
God. I'm so sorry.

799
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.770
I just. could you just. please?

800
00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.446
I'm really embarrassed to ask.

801
00:35:25.496 --> 00:35:26.363
but... - Check what?

802
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.130
Your briefcase.

803
00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.710
Oh. just to see. because it. it.

804
00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.460
it really does look
like that right there. so.

805
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.343
Sure.

806
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:50.853
Oh.

807
00:35:50.903 --> 00:35:51.736
Well. shit.

808
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.608
Thank you so much

809
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:58.083
for helping me find that though.

810
00:35:59.449 --> 00:36:01.510
I. I made a mistake.

811
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.397
I'm so sorry.

812
00:36:03.447 --> 00:36:05.950
Oh. no.
it's really no problem.

813
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.113
Thank you so much.

814
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.820
I mean.

815
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:10.893
gosh. I like.

816
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.990
I thought I took it outta the briefcase.

817
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.040
but I guess I didn't.

818
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:18.070
And I was up there and
it was all ubba-dob-a-dah.

819
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.430
And I saw the computer and I took it.

820
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.320
But it was his and I thought it was mine.

821
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.268
I must must be sleepwalking.
Mark?

822
00:36:26.318 --> 00:36:27.190
Mark?

823
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.720
I really do get it.

824
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.430
So you really don't need to explain.

825
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.313
Can I just?

826
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.973
Sure.

827
00:36:33.023 --> 00:36:34.057
I'll just take it.

828
00:36:37.798 --> 00:36:38.732
Thank you. - There you go.

829
00:36:38.776 --> 00:36:40.167
Thank you so much.

830
00:36:40.217 --> 00:36:41.110
Have a good night.

831
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.993
You too.

832
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.520
Okay. well. if that wasn't weird enough.

833
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.220
I feel like I literally just
stepped into the Twilight Zone

834
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:51.250
because after I caught Mark doing

835
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.980
some really freaking weird James Bond shit

836
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:59.030
with the laptop. I come
back and I find this.

837
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.360
I mean. apparently the owl from space

838
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.160
or hell has gotten in.

839
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:05.981
I mean. I have no idea how it did.

840
00:37:06.864 --> 00:37:09.220
I really just wanna get the you-know-what

841
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:12.610
from the toilet tank and
get the fuck up out of here.

842
00:37:14.433 --> 00:37:17.793
So. here I go.

843
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.643
Wish me luck.

844
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.090
Okay. buddy.

845
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.553
I come in peace.

846
00:37:46.282 --> 00:37:49.713
Oh. gosh.

847
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:55.913
Okay.

848
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:00.237
Thank you. Jeremiah.

849
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:11.553
Okay. so I've seen like. five
of them on the drive so far.

850
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.100
But they just whoosh
by or hover for a second.

851
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.473
and then they disappear.

852
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:22.473
But these have just been
sitting there for a couple minutes.

853
00:38:25.091 --> 00:38:26.320
Okay.

854
00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.810
I can't say that I am more
freaked out than I was before.

855
00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.060
but I am pretty freaked out.

856
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.500
They are right outside my house.

857
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.483
What do they want?

858
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:39.470
Oh. if I saw this video.
I would not believe me.

859
00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.272
Jeremiah?

860
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.468
Sorry.

861
00:39:03.518 --> 00:39:04.351
Yeah.

862
00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:07.005
Okay.

863
00:39:07.055 --> 00:39:08.472
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

864
00:39:08.522 --> 00:39:10.485
No. we don't need to leave the house.

865
00:39:10.535 --> 00:39:12.856
Of course. we have food.

866
00:39:12.906 --> 00:39:14.073
Yup. tomorrow.

867
00:39:15.394 --> 00:39:17.644
AOC. if you can believe it.

868
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:19.993
Yeah.

869
00:39:20.043 --> 00:39:21.955
I love you so much.

870
00:39:22.005 --> 00:39:24.413
I love you.

871
00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:26.079
Oh my god!

872
00:39:26.129 --> 00:39:27.303
Put the knife down! - I'm sorry!

873
00:39:27.353 --> 00:39:28.136
I'm sorry.

874
00:39:28.186 --> 00:39:28.977
Oh my god! - I'm sorry.

875
00:39:29.019 --> 00:39:30.726
What the fuck. dad?

876
00:39:30.776 --> 00:39:31.943
What the fuck?

877
00:39:33.153 --> 00:39:35.223
I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm an owl.

878
00:39:36.488 --> 00:39:37.947
I'm an owl.

879
00:39:37.997 --> 00:39:38.788
What do you mean you're an owl?

880
00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.380
I. I. I tried to. I tried
to scare them away.

881
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:42.580
I was scaring them...

882
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.480
Who'd you try to scare away. daddy?

883
00:39:45.717 --> 00:39:48.160
Hoo. Hoo.

884
00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.900
Oh. that's what the owl said.

885
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:50.741
That's what the owl said.

886
00:39:50.783 --> 00:39:51.940
What do you mean?

887
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:53.874
Did you see an owl?

888
00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:55.225
I'm going to my room.

889
00:39:55.275 --> 00:39:56.227
I'm going. I'm sorry.

890
00:39:56.277 --> 00:39:58.027
I'm going to my room.

891
00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:05.913
So dad got
into my makeup tonight.

892
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.933
Guess I'm on cleaning duty.

893
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:12.573
I'm tired.

894
00:40:12.623 --> 00:40:13.414
I know. dad.

895
00:40:13.456 --> 00:40:15.333
I just wanna get this really quick. okay?

896
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:17.973
Please?

897
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.990
It's embarrassing.

898
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.913
It's not
embarrassing. you were scared.

899
00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:26.440
Did you see something?

900
00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.390
Did something happen while I was gone?

901
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.490
It's okay. daddy. you can tell me.

902
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:34.373
No.

903
00:40:35.547 --> 00:40:36.847
Daddy.

904
00:40:38.757 --> 00:40:39.540
Uh-uh.

905
00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:42.543
You were saying
something about an owl?

906
00:40:46.214 --> 00:40:48.280
Don't say it.

907
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.730
Don't say what?

908
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.823
I know I'm sick.

909
00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.770
They're not real.

910
00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.208
Dad?

911
00:41:01.258 --> 00:41:02.943
Who. who isn't real?

912
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.960
I don't think they're real. I...

913
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:08.793
Dad?

914
00:41:08.843 --> 00:41:09.626
I hope they're not.

915
00:41:09.676 --> 00:41:11.503
I don't think you're crazy.

916
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.753
I remember it like a dream.

917
00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:22.780
There were these.

918
00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:25.660
these two owls. and they were

919
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.193
outside at the windows.

920
00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:35.103
But they didn't feel outside.

921
00:41:37.262 --> 00:41:38.462
They felt like they were

922
00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:41.283
inside me.

923
00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:48.333
Vampire

924
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:54.440
teeth. teeth of the devil.
They're insights. incisors.

925
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.793
Vampire teeth of the devil.

926
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.180
Oh. dad.

927
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.740
They suck on babies.

928
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:09.753
Dad.

929
00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.493
Stupid.

930
00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.583
That must have been so scary.

931
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:22.953
I made a fool of myself.

932
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.683
Well. they went
away. so maybe it worked.

933
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:34.750
Okay. so my dad's asleep.
so I have to be quiet.

934
00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.503
but I am so fucking freaked out right now.

935
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:43.120
And it's 3:00 AM and I have
the most important interview

936
00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:44.590
of my life in the morning.

937
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.910
And I can't sleep.

938
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.580
And for hours. I've been
tossing and turning in the dark.

939
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.220
But now I'm afraid of
the dark. like a baby.

940
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:55.120
And I've been going down
this crazy rabbit hole about owls

941
00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:59.110
and UFOs. and apparently
they're like. incredibly connected.

942
00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:03.070
And I've been getting these
emails. these crazy emails

943
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.230
from this guy. Caesar Green.

944
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:09.040
saying that Jeremiah is
alive and that I'm in danger.

945
00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:12.880
And for those of you who
don't know who Caesar Green is.

946
00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.460
he's this crazy conspiracy theory guy

947
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.830
who's been banned. like. everywhere.

948
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.470
And he is a far-right guy

949
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.200
who I truly want nothing to do with.

950
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:24.940
He's. he's a really bad guy.

951
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:28.930
He's said that mass shootings
are false flag operations

952
00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.890
and has spread incredibly
horrible COVID misinformation.

953
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.780
and election fraud lies.

954
00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:37.180
Bad. bad. bad guy.

955
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:40.450
But about 45 minutes
ago. he sent me this email

956
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:46.330
with a link to a video on his website.

957
00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.683
Truth Wars. appropriately named.

958
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.310
Ladies and gentlemen. you
may think you know the truth

959
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.990
about UFOs. Or now
they're calling them UAPs:

960
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.424
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

961
00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:17.830
You may have watched the X-Files.

962
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.760
seen documentaries. read some books.

963
00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:26.467
maybe even some official
military documents. Declassified.

964
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:32.253
But they're declassified.
which means they're bullshit.

965
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:38.260
This is all part of a coordinated campaign

966
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.000
to shape your perceptions.

967
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.573
This is how propaganda works. folks.

968
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:45.393
Read Edward Bernays.

969
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:47.800
Read Noam Chomsky.

970
00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.863
Read Alex Constantine.

971
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.110
Mind War.

972
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.483
Sci-Ops.

973
00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:59.463
Let's talk about another aerial phenomenon.

974
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.833
one that has been
identified since pre-history.

975
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.673
The owl.

976
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.840
Now what do owls have
to do with UFOs or UAPs

977
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:16.443
or whatever the elite
wants you to call them?

978
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:21.520
What would you say if I was to tell you

979
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.920
that owls had everything to do

980
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:25.923
with those little lights in the sky.

981
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.600
with the abductions and mutilations?

982
00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:35.260
And I'm not just talking
about cattle mutilations.

983
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:36.670
This is hidden.

984
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.980
This is something they
don't want you to know.

985
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:41.853
but for every cow they find.

986
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.373
they find 10 people.

987
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:51.033
Now. this next image is disturbing.

988
00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.273
I warn you.

989
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:59.673
I obtained this from one of
my contacts in intelligence.

990
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.820
Search this online.
and they'll tell you it's

991
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:06.700
a mob killing from 1982.

992
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.470
A mob killing?

993
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.170
That's like Epstein's Temple.

994
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:15.910
Remember Jeffrey Epstein
and Pedophile Island?

995
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.033
Where all the elites went to party?

996
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:22.660
Bill Gates. Bill Clinton?

997
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:24.850
Anthony Fauci?

998
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.910
And on this private
island. Pedophile Island.

999
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.000
where all the elites would hang out.

1000
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.393
there was this building.

1001
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.873
Do you know what the
mainstream media said this was?

1002
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.460
A music room.

1003
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:43.713
Can you believe that?

1004
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:47.193
What do you need a
mattress in a music room for?

1005
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:51.970
A music room.

1006
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.680
A mob killing.

1007
00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:55.983
A load of crap is what it is.

1008
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.020
And I'm not just rambling here.

1009
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:00.580
these things are connected.

1010
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:02.140
Look at this face.

1011
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.300
Does it remind you of anything?

1012
00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:06.693
Look closely if you can stomach it.

1013
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.600
For millennia. since the
dawn of recorded history.

1014
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:15.880
in every culture you can imagine.

1015
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:18.640
the owl has been seen as a messenger

1016
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:20.620
from the spirit world.

1017
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.510
from the underworld.

1018
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.090
The owl is a guardian at the gateway

1019
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:29.770
between our world and the
hidden realm of demonic forces.

1020
00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:32.860
And all the time.

1021
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:37.720
alien abduction experiences
and UFO sightings are preceded

1022
00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:42.770
or followed or connected in
some way or another to owls.

1023
00:47:43.276 --> 00:47:46.390
Owls are always showing up at these scenes.

1024
00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.930
There's a huge body of literature on this.

1025
00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:52.360
The elites know all about it.

1026
00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:56.283
And look here: that is Bohemian Grove.

1027
00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:02.270
Bohemian Grove. where elites
have met for a hundred years.

1028
00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:07.940
Presidents. Supreme Court
Justices. business tycoons.

1029
00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:10.443
And what is that they're worshiping?

1030
00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:13.413
Do I need to spell it out for you?

1031
00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.710
The video may be a little fuzzy.

1032
00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.650
but this video is actual footage.

1033
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.863
It's acknowledged. it's real.

1034
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.393
That is a giant owl deity.

1035
00:49:24.926 --> 00:49:29.500
Okay. I am just so nervous and so excited

1036
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:33.460
because my absolute
hero. one of them at least.

1037
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:36.430
AOC is about to be on my show.

1038
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.590
And you know what. I'm
just gonna keep it simple.

1039
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.010
Talk about Jeremiah. of course. and policy

1040
00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.680
and advocacy. - Hey.

1041
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.303
Hey. daddy.

1042
00:49:45.353 --> 00:49:46.233
What is that?

1043
00:49:47.463 --> 00:49:49.330
Dad. I'm doing something for work.

1044
00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:51.220
What the shit is that?

1045
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:52.180
It's okay. just...

1046
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:54.130
Can you go back into your room please?

1047
00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.877
So. as I was saying. AOC
is about to be on my show

1048
00:50:00.927 --> 00:50:02.973
and I am really excited.

1049
00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.500
So. great.

1050
00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:07.750
Thank you so much.

1051
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.730
Women helping women. right?

1052
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:10.840
Totally.

1053
00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:12.370
And you're a great interviewer.

1054
00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.260
You have a great little show going.

1055
00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:15.310
Oh. well. thank you.

1056
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:18.340
And of course. I will send
you a copy before I upload.

1057
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:20.470
And if there's anything you want me to edit

1058
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.080
or cut out. just please let me know.

1059
00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:24.760
Sure. Perfect.

1060
00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:26.830
And Mark had just.

1061
00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.760
he was absolutely glowing
when he spoke about you.

1062
00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:32.230
Oh. that's so nice.

1063
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.210
Yeah. Mark has been so great.

1064
00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.550
He's so supportive.

1065
00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.610
He mentioned that
there's a book coming out?

1066
00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.470
From Jeremiah. yeah.

1067
00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.653
Right. and there's gonna be even more?

1068
00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:46.060
Well. yeah. hopefully.

1069
00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:48.550
I mean. there's so
much that isn't published

1070
00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:50.680
and there's his blog. which is so big.

1071
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:54.040
and hopefully there's even
a book in there. you know?

1072
00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:55.870
Oh. that's so awesome.

1073
00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.790
He has such an amazing legacy.

1074
00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.730
It's beautiful that you're
helping to keep it alive.

1075
00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.250
Well. I'm doing everything that I can.

1076
00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.950
It's so important. especially right now.

1077
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.912
There's so much misinformation. you know?

1078
00:51:08.962 --> 00:51:09.843
Yeah.

1079
00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:13.630
It must be awful for you to see that

1080
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.130
in the middle of everything
you're going through.

1081
00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:19.660
Um. I don't. I don't know.

1082
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:21.490
It's just stupid people online.

1083
00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:22.953
Don't pay attention.

1084
00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:26.650
Oh. well. I don't really
think I even could at this point.

1085
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.580
Jeremiah was extraordinarily courageous.

1086
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:32.890
All the investigative stuff he was doing.

1087
00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.383
especially recently?

1088
00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.300
Uh. yeah.

1089
00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:40.870
And I know he was talking
to some intelligence people?

1090
00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.753
Oh.

1091
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.010
Did you know anything about that?

1092
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:48.190
Mm. no. I mean. he
was pretty tightlipped.

1093
00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.760
He didn't even show me
anything until it was finished

1094
00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:54.365
and. you know. he was
like an artist like that.

1095
00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.240
Sure. that's what made him so good.

1096
00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:00.880
But if you see anything when you're going

1097
00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:02.890
through his stuff that's direct interaction

1098
00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:04.840
with anyone from the government...

1099
00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:06.910
I'm sure Mark told you.

1100
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.880
Um. no.

1101
00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:12.993
Or maybe I. maybe. I don't remember.

1102
00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:16.090
Just send it to Mark or my staff.

1103
00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.110
I'll email you.

1104
00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.613
Okay. sounds good.

1105
00:52:20.496 --> 00:52:21.700
Oh. oh.

1106
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:22.930
Oh god. I'm so sorry.

1107
00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.660
I'm just a little bit jumpy these days.

1108
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:27.730
No. I should let you go.

1109
00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.450
Okay. well. seriously.
thank you so. so much again.

1110
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.264
I really appreciate this.

1111
00:52:34.147 --> 00:52:36.280
Okay. I'm coming.

1112
00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:37.720
I'm sorry about that.

1113
00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:40.840
Okay. and please just
remember if you see anything.

1114
00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:42.190
it could be a legal issue.

1115
00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.320
They're super strict about that stuff.

1116
00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:45.153
Oh. okay.

1117
00:52:45.203 --> 00:52:46.151
Yeah. for sure.

1118
00:52:47.034 --> 00:52:49.270
Okay. I'll be right there.

1119
00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.830
I'm so sorry.

1120
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.180
Okay. yes. yes. yes.

1121
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:53.063
Bye.

1122
00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:57.303
Okay. I'm coming!

1123
00:52:59.665 --> 00:53:00.498
Long time. no see.

1124
00:53:00.548 --> 00:53:01.450
Oh my gosh!

1125
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:03.273
Mark. what's going on?

1126
00:53:04.131 --> 00:53:05.227
Well. nothing.

1127
00:53:05.277 --> 00:53:06.060
Oh. I'm sorry.

1128
00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:06.893
Am I interrupting?

1129
00:53:06.943 --> 00:53:07.734
Oh. no. no. no.

1130
00:53:07.776 --> 00:53:09.225
I'm just finishing up my interview.

1131
00:53:09.275 --> 00:53:10.058
Okay.

1132
00:53:10.108 --> 00:53:11.890
Look. I don't wanna just barge in

1133
00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:12.731
on you like this. - Oh. no.

1134
00:53:12.773 --> 00:53:13.556
No. not at all.

1135
00:53:13.606 --> 00:53:14.493
What's going on?

1136
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:16.780
I feel terrible.

1137
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:18.080
Why. what's?

1138
00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.930
Your laptop.

1139
00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:22.240
Oh. I'm sorry. Jeremiah's laptop.

1140
00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:23.530
Oh. come on.

1141
00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:25.930
It was just an honest mistake. seriously.

1142
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.870
I'm just rushing all the time
from one place to the other.

1143
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.660
and sometimes I just. I don't even think.

1144
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:32.501
No. I know.

1145
00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:34.720
And seriously. you have been so supportive

1146
00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:37.840
that I truly didn't think anything of it.

1147
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:39.730
I just didn't want you to think.

1148
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.100
I didn't think. seriously.

1149
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:43.447
You stop thinking!

1150
00:53:43.497 --> 00:53:44.928
I already did.

1151
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:47.560
So. that makes me feel so much better.

1152
00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:51.010
And. you know. look.
I'm gonna say this again.

1153
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:55.300
If you ever need help
going through his files at all.

1154
00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:56.320
please come to me.

1155
00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:57.318
That is so sweet.

1156
00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.143
Thank you.

1157
00:53:58.193 --> 00:53:59.028
We have a team of editors.

1158
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:01.000
we have an army of professionals.

1159
00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:02.530
We have a whole bunch of equipment.

1160
00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.210
We can streamline the process.

1161
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.640
Get through it all.
get it off of your mind.

1162
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:08.313
What is going on behind you?

1163
00:54:09.286 --> 00:54:10.570
Oh. oh my gosh.

1164
00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:11.410
I'm so sorry.

1165
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.460
Jeremiah?

1166
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:14.950
Oh. - No. daddy.

1167
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:15.903
Remember?

1168
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:19.960
I'm so sorry. can...

1169
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:21.370
I've gotta go. - Okay.

1170
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:22.758
Thanks
so much for stopping by.

1171
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.860
I really appreciate it.

1172
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:24.955
Sure.

1173
00:54:25.005 --> 00:54:25.788
Bye.

1174
00:54:25.838 --> 00:54:27.102
Bye-bye.

1175
00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:33.212
What the fuck?

1176
00:54:33.262 --> 00:54:34.090
What that is?

1177
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.178
Oh. - What am I doing?

1178
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.220
No. daddy.

1179
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:37.450
It's okay.

1180
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.453
Just. can you go put some clothes on?

1181
00:54:40.451 --> 00:54:41.234
I'm sorry.

1182
00:54:41.284 --> 00:54:43.540
It's okay. you got me
out of a little pickle there.

1183
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:47.013
And just. if you put some
clothes on. it'll all be fine.

1184
00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:56.650
Con-. congresswoman?

1185
00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:57.963
Oh. hi.

1186
00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:00.640
I am so sorry.

1187
00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:02.140
No. I'm sorry.

1188
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:04.210
That was just a lot of knocking.

1189
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:06.460
I wanted to make sure you're okay.

1190
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:07.720
Oh. no. I am totally fine.

1191
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:08.980
Are you okay?

1192
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:11.643
Seriously. you shouldn't have seen that.

1193
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:16.180
Sacrifice. it's not a political question.

1194
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:19.660
It's not about. you know. left and right.

1195
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.850
It's about those. you know. who are worthy.

1196
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.710
It's older than politics.

1197
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.920
It's older than any
nation or any government.

1198
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:28.360
There's this distinction

1199
00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:31.000
between the exoteric and the esoteric.

1200
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:33.640
Because. from the outside.

1201
00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:35.973
the regular person sees a pandemic.

1202
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:39.910
But the pandemic helped facilitate

1203
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:43.390
the largest transfer of wealth in history.

1204
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:46.960
It announced the rise of a global power.

1205
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.570
It spawned new
opportunities for surveillance

1206
00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:53.043
and control. and.
ultimately. for sacrifice.

1207
00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:57.670
For transcendence for those who are worthy.

1208
00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.680
I've personally been preparing for.

1209
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:01.630
for decades for this moment.

1210
00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.580
But we've been preparing since

1211
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:07.180
before the foundations
of the earth were laid.

1212
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:10.930
There was this term the
Ancient Greeks used. "hecatomb."

1213
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.140
where they would sacrifice a hundred oxen.

1214
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:17.800
They gave what they could
give. and the gods honored it

1215
00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:19.683
and gave them knowledge.

1216
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:24.190
Every step along the way.
they gave us knowledge.

1217
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.190
helped us develop technologically

1218
00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:30.400
so we could offer more. Exoterically.

1219
00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:33.423
we see the rise and fall of civilizations.

1220
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:38.080
But esoterically. every catastrophe.

1221
00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:42.250
every dark age was engineered
by those who are worthy.

1222
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.953
It was a sacrifice.

1223
00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:49.293
And now we have the
resources to offer them the world.

1224
00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:56.981
Wait. wait. where are you going?

1225
00:56:57.023 --> 00:56:58.248
Where are you going? - No. I'm coming back.

1226
00:56:58.290 --> 00:56:59.073
I'm coming back.

1227
00:56:59.123 --> 00:57:01.923
Just as long as the
camera's on. we're safe.

1228
00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:03.593
Oh.

1229
00:57:05.252 --> 00:57:06.085
Aw.

1230
00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.809
What?

1231
00:57:11.859 --> 00:57:13.150
I'm sorry.

1232
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.033
What?

1233
00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.540
I forget.

1234
00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:17.640
What do you forget?

1235
00:57:19.859 --> 00:57:21.843
I don't know your husband.

1236
00:57:22.854 --> 00:57:25.420
I don't have a husband.

1237
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:26.520
You're not married?

1238
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:28.480
Nope.

1239
00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:29.321
You should get married.

1240
00:57:29.363 --> 00:57:30.639
Yeah. that's what I said.

1241
00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:32.583
What did he say?

1242
00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:34.713
He left.

1243
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:37.653
Bastard.

1244
00:57:37.703 --> 00:57:38.486
Oh. no. no. no.

1245
00:57:38.536 --> 00:57:39.319
Are you excited?

1246
00:57:39.369 --> 00:57:40.330
Is it a boy?

1247
00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.424
Oh. so if it was a girl.
you wouldn't be excited?

1248
00:57:42.474 --> 00:57:43.713
No. I'm happy.

1249
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.063
I'm gonna name him Jeremiah.

1250
00:57:52.619 --> 00:57:54.768
No.

1251
00:57:54.818 --> 00:57:55.601
No.

1252
00:57:55.651 --> 00:57:56.484
I know.

1253
00:57:57.567 --> 00:57:58.863
I'm not alive.

1254
00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:01.493
What?

1255
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:04.420
No.

1256
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:06.423
I live my life in a dream.

1257
00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.870
No. - All. all life

1258
00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:15.100
is swimming and dreaming

1259
00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:18.010
and then. and then they come

1260
00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:19.990
and they eat your memories.

1261
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.010
Dad?

1262
00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:23.470
They eat and they drink

1263
00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:26.380
like big fish and I can't even swim.

1264
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:27.970
Dad. please.

1265
00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:29.110
Hey.

1266
00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:29.993
Dad?

1267
00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.523
Hello. dad?

1268
00:58:33.899 --> 00:58:35.823
Baby. I'm tired.

1269
00:58:38.794 --> 00:58:39.627
I know.

1270
00:58:40.704 --> 00:58:41.537
I know. me too.

1271
00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:53.720
So. dad's asleep and I am in the mood

1272
00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:55.840
for more conspiracy theories.

1273
00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:58.060
Because what else am I gonna do tonight.

1274
00:58:58.110 --> 00:58:59.500
you know?

1275
00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:02.770
Oh. and lucky me. I got another email

1276
00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:04.983
from good ole Caesar Green.

1277
00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.170
Let's see what it says.

1278
00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.230
This is an interview
with Colonel Larry Moses.

1279
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.150
He was an officer in the Air Force

1280
00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:16.270
and worked for decades in the CIA.

1281
00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:18.820
Larry died a week after we spoke.

1282
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:21.430
a heart attack. despite no previous history

1283
00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.263
of heart trouble.

1284
00:59:22.313 --> 00:59:24.010
I wanted to introduce this

1285
00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.930
and let my viewers know that

1286
00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:28.030
because it makes his
remarks at the beginning

1287
00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:31.143
of our discussion so much more powerful.

1288
00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:58.030
Colonel Moses. thank you for coming on.

1289
00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.590
Thank you for having me.

1290
00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.750
You've been sticking your
neck out for a long time.

1291
01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.910
I figured you could use some company.

1292
01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.283
It's courageous of you.

1293
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:09.250
I know a lot of my viewers have been asking

1294
01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.810
because I get this question all the time.

1295
01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:15.860
but how are you even still alive right now?

1296
01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:21.170
If what you say is true.
there's some very dark forces

1297
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:24.640
that'll stop at nothing to silence you.

1298
01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:25.840
Oh. I'm a dead man.

1299
01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:26.860
You're-?

1300
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:28.360
I mean that literally.

1301
01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:31.030
I was contacted when
we scheduled the interview

1302
01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.500
and informed that should I go on

1303
01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:34.330
and reveal what I know.

1304
01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.070
I would be dealt with.

1305
01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.870
And yet. you still came here.

1306
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.763
It's my duty.

1307
01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.440
I've got grandkids.

1308
01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:44.260
And if there's gonna be
anything left of this country.

1309
01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:47.020
of this world. someone needs to expose

1310
01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:49.623
what is going on. someone official.

1311
01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:52.930
You've been talking about this for years.

1312
01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.520
but they can just dismiss you.

1313
01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:56.590
call you a conspiracy theorist.

1314
01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.660
kick you off the internet.

1315
01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:00.637
They've done all of the above.

1316
01:01:00.687 --> 01:01:02.553
And that's why you're not dead yet.

1317
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:07.023
So tell us.

1318
01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.630
what do you have for us. Colonel Moses?

1319
01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.640
I spent a lot of time in the CIA

1320
01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:16.570
and people have heard of MK Ultra.

1321
01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.980
mind-control experiments.

1322
01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.320
All that stuff is common knowledge.

1323
01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:22.934
but it goes so much deeper.

1324
01:01:23.817 --> 01:01:26.590
It's not even the
tippy-tip of the iceberg.

1325
01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.150
Not even.

1326
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.350
You contacted me because of my connection

1327
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.080
between the extraterrestrial and the-

1328
01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:35.980
Yes. - Yeah.

1329
01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:40.060
Yes. and the connection
to DMT. psychedelics.

1330
01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:42.873
and ultimately. I mean. you were right.

1331
01:01:44.866 --> 01:01:47.020
Human sacrifice. adrenochrome.

1332
01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:47.853
That's it.

1333
01:01:47.903 --> 01:01:49.030
That's right.

1334
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.680
Children.

1335
01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:51.513
Satanism.

1336
01:01:51.563 --> 01:01:53.080
All of it. yes.

1337
01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:55.030
And you were a part of this.

1338
01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.450
Firsthand. but we
didn't call it Satanism.

1339
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.780
Most of the people working
these operations are good people.

1340
01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:03.910
They think they're
fighting for their country.

1341
01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.160
They think they're doing the right thing.

1342
01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:07.990
How can you explain that?

1343
01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.540
We're doing what we're told.

1344
01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.480
It's not just orders from
our direct superiors.

1345
01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:15.280
This comes from the president.

1346
01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:17.710
There is a coordinated.
international effort

1347
01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.560
to contact these beings.

1348
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:22.293
And these beings...

1349
01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.450
elaborate. please.

1350
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.860
I don't know what to call them.

1351
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.630
This idea that they're visitors

1352
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.230
from another planet is a
total misrepresentation.

1353
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.692
No little green men from Mars?

1354
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:37.570
There may be little green men.

1355
01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.250
but they're not for Mars.

1356
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.280
They've been here as long
as we have. maybe longer.

1357
01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.710
The idea that we're the
most intelligent life form

1358
01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.200
in the universe is obviously preposterous.

1359
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:48.083
Of course.

1360
01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:50.890
But you pointed out. I think.

1361
01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.870
that we take for granted that we're

1362
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.820
at the top of the heap on this planet.

1363
01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:57.743
That's right.

1364
01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:02.050
I always like to use
the metaphor of spiders.

1365
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.580
Okay?

1366
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:05.043
Imagine you're a spider.

1367
01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.600
Your eyes don't work like ours do.

1368
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:13.450
Your brain is the size of a pinhead.

1369
01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:17.170
But if somehow somebody
could explain to you

1370
01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.570
that. in spider language.

1371
01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:23.050
that there are these things called people

1372
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:28.090
and they live in these
things called cities.

1373
01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.940
and you're in this thing called a pantry.

1374
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.070
you wouldn't believe them.

1375
01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.860
They'd call you a conspiracy theorist.

1376
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:37.023
That's right.

1377
01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:42.190
But if you didn't listen.
you'd still get squished.

1378
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.570
You would.

1379
01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.530
Hm.

1380
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.510
But there's a key difference here:

1381
01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.180
you can't communicate with the spider.

1382
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:52.420
but these beings want
to communicate with us.

1383
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:54.190
They want us to know about them?

1384
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.030
Yes.

1385
01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.080
Why?

1386
01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:58.150
That's the million-dollar question.

1387
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.910
Initially we thought they
were products of hallucination.

1388
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.180
We were experimenting
with all kinds of narcotics.

1389
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:07.570
astral-projection. stopping people's hearts

1390
01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.770
and reviving them.

1391
01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:12.250
And in recording a lot of
these experiences. we noticed

1392
01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.813
that the subjects described
seeing these beings.

1393
01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:21.160
But why trust the record of a drug trip?

1394
01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:23.590
Normally we wouldn't.
and we didn't at first

1395
01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:26.553
until these beings started
passing along information.

1396
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:31.270
Subjects started spouting
equations and so forth.

1397
01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.640
These people would come down

1398
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:35.950
and they'd draw blueprints for technology

1399
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.793
that was way beyond
anything we were capable of.

1400
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:41.530
And where is all this coming from?

1401
01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.110
From them. from these beings.

1402
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.550
Sounds pretty noble.

1403
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.640
like they're trying to help us out.

1404
01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:50.470
That's what we thought at first.

1405
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.680
But nothing's free with
them. we found that out.

1406
01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:55.120
What do they want?

1407
01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:56.003
Gold?

1408
01:04:58.496 --> 01:05:00.127
Blood.

1409
01:05:00.177 --> 01:05:01.710
Adrenalized blood.

1410
01:05:03.362 --> 01:05:04.635
Dad?

1411
01:05:04.685 --> 01:05:05.518
Dad!

1412
01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.231
Dad!

1413
01:05:08.151 --> 01:05:09.576
Dad. are you okay?

1414
01:05:36.711 --> 01:05:37.544
Dad?

1415
01:05:39.953 --> 01:05:40.786
Dad?

1416
01:06:06.312 --> 01:06:07.145
Hello?

1417
01:06:08.453 --> 01:06:09.945
I
don't know what's happening.

1418
01:06:09.987 --> 01:06:11.643
Dad just disappeared.

1419
01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:18.100
Jeremiah called and said
that the bad guys got him.

1420
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:20.440
but dad's alive. so that's good.

1421
01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:23.200
It's 10:45 and Jeremiah
said I had to go back

1422
01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:26.013
to his apartment to
get a gun. just in case.

1423
01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:29.260
But I've never used
a gun in my entire life.

1424
01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:31.060
And I hate guns and I never thought

1425
01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:32.410
I would have to even touch one.

1426
01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:34.530
But here I am. so.

1427
01:06:35.413 --> 01:06:36.288
This is so much bigger than that.

1428
01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:37.580
I can't think about that.

1429
01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.870
Jeremiah said that the
world is about to change

1430
01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.993
and I believe him because. look.

1431
01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.610
Why is nobody talking about this?

1432
01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:51.250
I turn on the news and nothing.

1433
01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:54.100
Nobody is outside. nobody's freaking out.

1434
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:55.683
What is happening?

1435
01:06:59.214 --> 01:07:00.400
Adrenalized blood.

1436
01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:01.930
From what we could determine.

1437
01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.520
these are interdimensional beings.

1438
01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:06.040
and they want to get
their hooks into our world.

1439
01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:09.040
They don't have bodies.
so they're locked out.

1440
01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:11.080
Why do they need blood?

1441
01:07:11.130 --> 01:07:14.350
It's not simple.
but long story short.

1442
01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.413
there are spiritual properties in blood.

1443
01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:21.640
It can be a kind of bridge
between dimensions.

1444
01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:23.890
Between the
spirit world and our world.

1445
01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:25.240
You could say that. yeah.

1446
01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:28.570
Mm-hm. which explains why

1447
01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:32.703
all these pagan deities
demanded human sacrifices.

1448
01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:39.350
But the Abrahamic
religions. they were against it.

1449
01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:43.330
This has been
going on for a very long time.

1450
01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:46.000
Since the
dawn of recorded history.

1451
01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:48.520
And there
are certain kinds of blood

1452
01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:52.600
that are considered optimal
to achieve communication.

1453
01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:55.300
To make a more stable bridge?

1454
01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:57.633
Virgins. children.

1455
01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:01.863
And that's why
the gods demanded them.

1456
01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:05.043
And adrenalized blood.

1457
01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:09.520
That's the
other component. yeah.

1458
01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:12.850
It sounds horrible. but
to get all that adrenaline

1459
01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:17.900
in the blood. the most
effective way is to induce fear.

1460
01:08:19.007 --> 01:08:21.281
Oh. god. the fuckin' light is on.

1461
01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:22.164
Mark!

1462
01:08:23.673 --> 01:08:25.750
Hey. hey. hold on a second.

1463
01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.781
Please. I'm here to help you. okay?

1464
01:08:26.823 --> 01:08:29.110
What the
fuck are you doing here?

1465
01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.490
You're in danger.

1466
01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:31.338
Get the fuck out right now!

1467
01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:33.130
Jeremiah is in danger.

1468
01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:34.065
Get his name out of your mouth.

1469
01:08:34.107 --> 01:08:35.350
Oh. come on!

1470
01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.900
Listen. I know we don't get along

1471
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:39.760
and we have differences of opinions.

1472
01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:42.160
but you need to listen to me. okay?

1473
01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:44.410
Jeremiah is being manipulated.

1474
01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:45.251
Oh. shut the fuck up!

1475
01:08:45.293 --> 01:08:47.140
And I know that he's still alive.

1476
01:08:47.190 --> 01:08:48.550
Put it down. okay?

1477
01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.630
Okay. listen.

1478
01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:52.750
We're both dead if you don't listen to me.

1479
01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.220
Oh. yeah? - Okay?

1480
01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:55.182
You first!

1481
01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:56.015
No. no. no. no.

1482
01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:56.856
You're gonna die.

1483
01:08:56.898 --> 01:08:58.360
No. no. no. put that down. please.

1484
01:08:58.410 --> 01:08:59.193
Please. please. please.

1485
01:08:59.243 --> 01:09:00.438
Have you been stalking me?

1486
01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.263
No. I haven't been stalking you.

1487
01:09:03.313 --> 01:09:05.770
I have contacts in intelligence. okay.

1488
01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.265
from the good guys. and

1489
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:09.700
Okay. listen.

1490
01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:12.951
Jeremiah is being lied to.

1491
01:09:13.001 --> 01:09:16.180
You are being lied to and
we are running out of time.

1492
01:09:16.230 --> 01:09:17.013
Okay?

1493
01:09:17.063 --> 01:09:18.713
So please. please.
please. please believe me.

1494
01:09:18.763 --> 01:09:19.554
Okay. if you do not-

1495
01:09:19.596 --> 01:09:20.890
Just come. just come with me.

1496
01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.158
No. I am not coming with you.

1497
01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.002
Oh. come on!

1498
01:09:23.052 --> 01:09:24.240
I am not coming with you!

1499
01:09:24.282 --> 01:09:25.968
Come on. I'm begging you!

1500
01:09:26.018 --> 01:09:26.801
Okay!

1501
01:09:26.851 --> 01:09:28.768
Okay. okay. okay. okay.

1502
01:09:31.742 --> 01:09:32.781
Okay.

1503
01:09:32.823 --> 01:09:35.500
So it's 11:45. someone's coming soon.

1504
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:38.560
But I'm really glad that
I turned off all the lights

1505
01:09:38.610 --> 01:09:41.523
and parked far away because look.

1506
01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:43.623
Jeremiah knew.

1507
01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:46.713
He got me to leave to protect me.

1508
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:48.833
Oh. shit.

1509
01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.570
Oh. shit. shit. shit. shit.

1510
01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.800
We gotta go quick.

1511
01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:56.193
Get the package and the gun. and let's go.

1512
01:10:05.681 --> 01:10:10.681
♪ I got a gun ♪

1513
01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:13.780
Thank you so much.

1514
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:15.730
Is Jeremiah safe?

1515
01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.440
And what about my dad?

1516
01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:19.000
Jeremiah's safe.

1517
01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:21.580
We're working on securing your father.

1518
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:22.930
He's gonna be okay.

1519
01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:25.180
Do you see these UFOs?

1520
01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:27.130
Am I going crazy?

1521
01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.300
You're not crazy.

1522
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:30.130
And you know what?

1523
01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.470
Is there a space invasion?

1524
01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.870
Can you please explain what's happening?

1525
01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.490
Are you familiar with Project Blue Beam?

1526
01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.230
Also. why are there owls?

1527
01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.560
This is above top secret.
this is beyond classified.

1528
01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:45.938
Any records. if they ever
existed. have been destroyed.

1529
01:10:45.988 --> 01:10:47.290
Oh. god.

1530
01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:49.120
It's just conspiracy theories.

1531
01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:51.010
You only know what you've
seen and what you've read.

1532
01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:55.120
Textbooks. newspapers.
the television. the internet.

1533
01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:59.560
it's been increasingly becoming electronic.

1534
01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:01.260
Like Edward Snowden?

1535
01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.280
Snowden is just the tip
of the tip of the iceberg.

1536
01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:09.243
If they could do that then. years ago?

1537
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:14.560
Track your movements.
listen in on your conversations

1538
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:17.313
to get you buying products and clicking?

1539
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:22.090
And that was just what
they publicly acknowledged.

1540
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.950
How much more advanced are they now?

1541
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.073
Oh wait. why are we stopped?

1542
01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.990
Do you mean that they can hear my thoughts?

1543
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.483
How about your soul?

1544
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:38.860
What if the technology isn't human?

1545
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:41.020
So this is an alien thing?

1546
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:41.903
Maybe.

1547
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.900
Maybe worse.

1548
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:47.650
It's in the satellites. it's in
the chem trails. the phones.

1549
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.313
the radio waves. in the tap water.

1550
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.120
Wait. this is
just more conspiracy theories.

1551
01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:56.733
Why are we stopped?

1552
01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:01.600
They can shape all your memories

1553
01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:05.500
and everything you see. all history.

1554
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:07.863
A daydream. a nightmare.

1555
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:11.660
For all you know. you never had a brother.

1556
01:12:13.597 --> 01:12:14.927
What the fuck!

1557
01:12:14.977 --> 01:12:16.400
What is going on!

1558
01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:17.285
Oh my god!

1559
01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:23.041
Shh.

1560
01:12:25.198 --> 01:12:27.615
That was fucking crazy!

1561
01:12:27.665 --> 01:12:28.540
What the fuck!

1562
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:30.970
Wait. you all knew it was
that Caesar guy. wasn't it?

1563
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.170
Yeah. it was one of his guys.

1564
01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:33.136
Oh. - It was one of his guys.

1565
01:12:33.178 --> 01:12:34.199
Oh my god. I'm so glad you're okay.

1566
01:12:34.241 --> 01:12:36.300
I am so glad you're okay.

1567
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:38.500
Oh my God. I missed you so much. bro.

1568
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:40.549
I really never want you to die.

1569
01:12:40.599 --> 01:12:41.413
Wait. hold on.

1570
01:12:41.463 --> 01:12:42.439
Where are we going?

1571
01:12:42.489 --> 01:12:44.020
We're going someplace safe.

1572
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:46.660
I'm gonna drop you while
I tie up a few loose ends.

1573
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:47.501
and then I'm gonna get dad

1574
01:12:47.543 --> 01:12:48.588
and I'm gonna bring it back to you.

1575
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:49.930
No. no. no. no. no.

1576
01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:51.400
Wherever you go. I go. bro.

1577
01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:54.310
I am not letting you leave me somewhere.

1578
01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.040
No. you're gonna. you're
gonna just wait on me

1579
01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:59.710
to bring dad back. Tig.
we're winning this shit.

1580
01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.810
This shit is about to be over.

1581
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.728
It's almost done. The
good guys are winning.

1582
01:13:03.778 --> 01:13:06.139
Yeah. but I
really wanna help you. please.

1583
01:13:06.189 --> 01:13:07.150
You are helping me.

1584
01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.800
You're helping me by trusting me.

1585
01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:09.991
Random place?

1586
01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:10.957
How am I supposed... It's safe.

1587
01:13:10.999 --> 01:13:12.310
How am I supposed to know?

1588
01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:14.020
Everything has turned out unsafe.

1589
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:16.000
I thought that my house was safe.

1590
01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:17.500
Nope. not safe.

1591
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:19.270
Like. I don't understand.

1592
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.860
What am I supposed to believe?

1593
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:22.891
Please. just let me stay with you. please.

1594
01:13:22.941 --> 01:13:24.400
Shut the fuck up for a second.

1595
01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:25.390
Tig. please.

1596
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.410
I'm sorry. I love you.

1597
01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:27.580
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1598
01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:28.536
No. I'm sorry.

1599
01:13:28.586 --> 01:13:29.377
I'm a little I know. I know.

1600
01:13:29.419 --> 01:13:30.940
We're just both keyed up. we're tired.

1601
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:31.934
You need to rest.

1602
01:13:31.984 --> 01:13:32.775
Okay. - Alright?

1603
01:13:32.817 --> 01:13:34.810
Trust me. I'm gonna bring dad back.

1604
01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.670
You don't have to film all of this.

1605
01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.373
You should film all of this.

1606
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.460
We're gonna be together.
this shit is gonna be over soon.

1607
01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:43.301
Yeah. okay.

1608
01:13:43.343 --> 01:13:44.126
Okay.

1609
01:13:44.176 --> 01:13:45.850
I'm really sorry.

1610
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.550
I know you've been through a lot.

1611
01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:49.777
I didn't mean to annoy you.

1612
01:13:49.827 --> 01:13:50.890
No. you're not annoying me.

1613
01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.173
I love you. you're good.

1614
01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:55.068
I'm really. I really didn't-

1615
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:57.015
No. shh-shh. just.

1616
01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.019
I'll. I'll do...

1617
01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:10.263
So I'm here.

1618
01:14:11.850 --> 01:14:13.443
Jeremiah left me out.

1619
01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:16.443
I'm fuckin' pissed.

1620
01:14:17.345 --> 01:14:18.178
Ugh.

1621
01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.080
I'm trying to understand it.

1622
01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:27.490
I'm trying to be patient.

1623
01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:31.570
but I just really thought
that he would want me

1624
01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:35.883
at this time. but I
guess not. I don't know.

1625
01:14:42.206 --> 01:14:45.010
He said he'd call me with next steps.

1626
01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:48.143
Whatever that means. Probably
like some unimportant shit.

1627
01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.470
Okay.

1628
01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.353
Wait.

1629
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:57.623
Hello?

1630
01:14:59.970 --> 01:15:01.293
Yeah. yeah. it's here.

1631
01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:06.094
Yep.

1632
01:15:06.144 --> 01:15:09.202
Ugh.

1633
01:15:14.730 --> 01:15:15.993
What am I watching?

1634
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:22.150
You want me to tell you what I'm seeing?

1635
01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.033
Okay.

1636
01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.563
There are owls.

1637
01:15:29.970 --> 01:15:34.503
I don't know what that is
supposed to be. exactly.

1638
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:40.443
Wait a second.

1639
01:15:50.064 --> 01:15:51.790
Um. Jeremiah?

1640
01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.380
Can you hold on one second?

1641
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:55.411
I'm not feeling very well.

1642
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:58.590
Let me call you back.

1643
01:16:39.002 --> 01:16:40.640
Jeremiah.

1644
01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:43.690
there are people outside with hoods.

1645
01:16:45.206 --> 01:16:47.785
No. I'm not putting you on speakerphone.

1646
01:16:47.835 --> 01:16:48.668
It's loud.

1647
01:16:52.344 --> 01:16:54.594
Yes. of course I trust you.

1648
01:16:56.516 --> 01:16:57.299
Okay.

1649
01:16:57.349 --> 01:16:58.266
Okay. fine.

1650
01:16:59.926 --> 01:17:01.985
Hello. you're on speakerphone.

1651
01:17:02.035 --> 01:17:04.903
Okay. hey. it's over.

1652
01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:06.220
We got 'em.

1653
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:07.660
Special forces are outside.

1654
01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.070
The bad guys are gone. okay?

1655
01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.920
Alright. three of 'em are
dead. one of 'em got arrested.

1656
01:17:11.970 --> 01:17:15.220
Jeremiah. there are people outside.

1657
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:16.750
Do you hear me?

1658
01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.583
They're. they're not-

1659
01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.424
No. no. no. no. no.

1660
01:17:18.466 --> 01:17:19.409
They're the bad. they have hoods.

1661
01:17:19.451 --> 01:17:20.470
We are outside.

1662
01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.803
They almost got you but you're safe now.

1663
01:17:24.801 --> 01:17:26.110
Wait? - You're safe.

1664
01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.641
Wait. they're at the door.

1665
01:17:28.691 --> 01:17:29.531
They're at the door.

1666
01:17:29.581 --> 01:17:31.531
It's me!
You're Safe! Come out!

1667
01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:32.822
You can come out.

1668
01:17:32.872 --> 01:17:33.655
Come on out.

1669
01:17:33.705 --> 01:17:34.877
Okay. okay. one second.

1670
01:17:34.927 --> 01:17:36.361
Open the door.

1671
01:17:36.411 --> 01:17:40.385
Come on.

1672
01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:44.722
I love you. baby.

1673
01:17:44.772 --> 01:17:46.930
I love you. daddy.

1674
01:17:57.234 --> 01:17:58.693
Baby. what's wrong?

1675
01:17:58.743 --> 01:17:59.526
Jeremiah?

1676
01:17:59.576 --> 01:18:00.535
Jeremiah?

1677
01:18:07.418 --> 01:18:08.383
Baby. what's wrong?

1678
01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:09.616
Hey. what's wrong. what's wrong?

1679
01:18:09.666 --> 01:18:10.587
What's wrong?

1680
01:18:10.637 --> 01:18:11.471
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

1681
01:18:11.521 --> 01:18:12.530
She's okay.

1682
01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:13.672
Are you okay?

1683
01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:14.717
You okay?

1684
01:18:14.767 --> 01:18:17.030
Hey. he's not dead.

1685
01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.673
Hey!

1686
01:18:18.723 --> 01:18:20.103
Hey. this isn't real.

1687
01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.093
This isn't real. okay?

1688
01:18:24.052 --> 01:18:25.671
This is just a dream. remember?

1689
01:18:26.554 --> 01:18:27.970
This whole thing is just a dream.

1690
01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.840
Someone's trying to get
you and you can't move.

1691
01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:35.650
You open your mouth and there's nothing.

1692
01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.203
There's barely a whisper.

1693
01:18:38.121 --> 01:18:39.250
Huh?

1694
01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.083
Daddy.

1695
01:18:40.133 --> 01:18:42.540
Do you know why you can't scream?

1696
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:45.940
What?

1697
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:48.580
Because there's nothing to cry out for.

1698
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:50.073
There's nothing to mourn.

1699
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:52.930
All of history is effaced.

1700
01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:54.910
All of history is a palimpsest.

1701
01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.690
It's a roll of film. unused and exposed.

1702
01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.953
baking in the sunlight. not even forgotten.

1703
01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:06.908
Listen. Antigone. it was never even there.

1704
01:19:10.949 --> 01:19:12.964
What are you doing to me?

1705
01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:14.236
Shh.

1706
01:19:14.286 --> 01:19:15.546
Antigone?

1707
01:19:15.596 --> 01:19:17.077
Antigone.

1708
01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:19.420
Hey. you are under the influence

1709
01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:22.900
of a very powerful
psychotropic agent right now.

1710
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:24.280
Okay?

1711
01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:28.660
It is designed to induce fear in you

1712
01:19:28.710 --> 01:19:31.210
and in your unborn child.

1713
01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:32.800
Okay?

1714
01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:37.850
If you can understand me. I
want you to listen to my words.

1715
01:19:38.490 --> 01:19:42.130
I am not trying to help you.

1716
01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:44.290
Let that sink in.

1717
01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:47.588
I am trying to make it worse.

1718
01:19:49.593 --> 01:19:51.040
Shh. Antigone. hey. hey. hey.

1719
01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:51.873
Look at me.

1720
01:19:51.923 --> 01:19:52.706
Listen. listen. listen.

1721
01:19:52.756 --> 01:19:54.520
I know this is hard. but you have to try.

1722
01:19:54.570 --> 01:19:56.290
Okay. I need you to try.

1723
01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:59.020
This was all theater from moment one.

1724
01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:02.650
beautiful as genocide or the atom bomb.

1725
01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:04.780
or the Great Leap Forward.

1726
01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:06.520
What's a million dead Iraqis?

1727
01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:07.750
Go to the the graves of the ones

1728
01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.820
that have been buried and dig them up

1729
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:11.290
and tell me. please. Antigone.

1730
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:14.500
if you can distinguish their rotting flesh

1731
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:16.540
from the carrion of beasts.

1732
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:19.000
They are no bodies. Antigone.

1733
01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:21.880
There is no evidence unless it is captured

1734
01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:26.770
in text or on film. The
atrocity undone in its remaking.

1735
01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:30.640
In its elevation to a fetish.
to a symbol of horror.

1736
01:20:30.690 --> 01:20:33.160
the horror itself is so diminished

1737
01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:34.930
as to be entirely forgotten.

1738
01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:37.720
Eroded. weathered
to a smudge on the palimpsest.

1739
01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:38.860
Barely a smudge.

1740
01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:40.480
She'll feel everything. right?

1741
01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:42.640
Yeah. every sensation is amplified.

1742
01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:43.481
This is basically the
opposite of anesthesia.

1743
01:20:43.523 --> 01:20:44.356
Okay.

1744
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.650
The copy is all that's left.

1745
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.630
We are led by our lady Babalon

1746
01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.670
from the real to the unreal.

1747
01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.780
from light to darkness.
from death to immortality.

1748
01:20:55.830 --> 01:21:00.190
And I saw a woman
seated on a scarlet beast

1749
01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.950
that was full of blasphemous names.

1750
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.980
and it had seven heads and ten horns.

1751
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:08.800
And the woman was
clothed in purple and scarlet

1752
01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:12.490
and adorned in gold and jewels and pearls.

1753
01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:17.230
And in her hand was a
golden cup full of abominations

1754
01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.420
and of the impurities of her fornication.

1755
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:23.050
And on her forehead was written a name.

1756
01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.713
a mystery. Babylon.

1757
01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:27.453
I love you. baby.

1758
01:21:27.503 --> 01:21:30.730
The great mother of whores
and of Earth's abominations.

1759
01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:34.600
And I saw that she was
drunk on the blood of the saints

1760
01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:37.983
and on the blood of the witnesses to Jesus.

1761
01:21:43.257 --> 01:21:44.731
Jeremiah?

1762
01:21:44.781 --> 01:21:45.614
Jeremiah?

1763
01:21:46.684 --> 01:21:47.656
Do it!

1764
01:21:47.706 --> 01:21:48.539
