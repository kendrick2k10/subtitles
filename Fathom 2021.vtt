3
00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:20.993
"I'm trying to start a conversation."

4
00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:24.913
is the most basic way you can say it.

5
00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:32.796
I am going to put a speaker in the ocean
and talk to a whale

6
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.548
and hope it talks back.

7
00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.395
If this work is successful.

8
00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.732
it will be the first experiment

9
00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:55.027
where we have actively engaged
in a dialogue with a humpback whale.

10
00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.626
People have been studying
humpback song for 40. 50 years.

11
00:04:56.505 --> 00:05:00.926
And still.
no one really knows why they sing.

12
00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:22.281
Birds have song.

13
00:05:24.116 --> 00:05:25.576
And other whales have song.

14
00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:33.250
But humpback song...
is even more elaborate.

15
00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.088
They have rhythm.

16
00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:41.842
Timed breathing.

17
00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:47.306
Rhyming and repetition.

18
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.525
Hours of patterns within patterns.

19
00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:05.073
With no clear beginning or end.

20
00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:12.789
I think humpback song
is complex communication...

21
00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.419
on a scale that has no analog
that we know of.

22
00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.508
Except us.

23
00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.408
My stepfather was a classical pianist.

24
00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:55.541
When he sat down to teach me the piano.

25
00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:01.421
he told me to play one note
and to close my eyes and listen...

26
00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.301
until the sound disappeared.

27
00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:16.645
He wanted me to understand
the sound by experiencing it.

28
00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.993
This is a lot easier when you're on land.

29
00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:34.288
So then you go to set the timer.

30
00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:38.458
So this system communicates with this box?

31
00:07:39.543 --> 00:07:43.213
Took ten years to lay the groundwork

32
00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:48.886
before we could even begin to build
the playback files to play to the whales.

33
00:07:52.723 --> 00:07:55.601
-Good. It's live.
-Nice.

34
00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:02.357
Oh. yeah.

35
00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:03.859
-It's working?
-Yeah. Very well.

36
00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.277
-Great. Good.
-Okay.

37
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.154
-Power on?
-Power's on.

38
00:08:08.572 --> 00:08:09.698
Yes.

39
00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:20.667
Yeah. that's the one
it's gonna struggle with.

40
00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:24.087
That's it. This is the--
That's the playback call.

41
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:26.423
That was the actual call
that we will be playing--

42
00:08:26.507 --> 00:08:27.799
Or one of the calls.

43
00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.594
Yeah. we'll need to adjust it
a little bit.

44
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.804
Yeah. I mean. we could reduce the volume.

45
00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:35.933
Maybe--

46
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.520
Something's clipping.
You may need to adjust.

47
00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.897
-Well. it's clipping from the recording.
-Oh. okay.

48
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.815
Yeah. The clipping's from the recording.

49
00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:48.028
So these recordings haven't been filtered.
they haven't been adjusted at all.

50
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.701
That's good.

51
00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:01.124
-Something's not quite right.
-No. Something's not right.

52
00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:03.418
I am trying to fool the whale.

53
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.797
I should be transparent about that.

54
00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:11.343
I'm trying to convince the humpback

55
00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:14.805
that there is another whale in the water
that is vocalizing.

56
00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:20.394
We were just brainstorming a few things.
and we might have stumbled upon...

57
00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:25.440
So playback experiments in the past
made a lot of terrible sounds by accident.

58
00:09:27.109 --> 00:09:31.113
This is how it works.
For half of the verse it's the real song.

59
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:35.701
The last time they did playbacks.

60
00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:37.995
they ended up sounding like
a humpback whale on helium.

61
00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.997
And this is the reconstructed one.

62
00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.586
And then they wondered
why no one responded.

63
00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:48.422
-You clear out everything.
-Yeah. you lose all the noise.

64
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.048
And here you have the waveform.

65
00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:52.968
Blue is the input and red is
what we're listening to now.

66
00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:55.053
-And red is what we're hearing now.
-Yeah.

67
00:09:55.137 --> 00:09:57.723
And you basically are
just working with signal?

68
00:09:57.806 --> 00:10:00.142
So. you don't have any issues
with the spectrogram?

69
00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:04.688
All the clicks and everything
would be thrown away.

70
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.398
That's a great idea.

71
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:11.528
The only issue I see is that
most humpback calls aren't tonal.

72
00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:14.781
I mean. they're amplitude-modulated calls.

73
00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:17.826
And they're short.
So a lot of them are these sort of...

74
00:10:20.871 --> 00:10:22.956
calls that aren't harmonic
and aren't tonal.

75
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.249
That's amazing.

76
00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.418
You do it real well.

77
00:10:26.502 --> 00:10:29.755
Then it's just. again.
I think. gonna be about clarity.

78
00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.591
-I think we should try it.
-Yeah.

79
00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:43.101
If you were to listen to all the whales
around the world at the same time.

80
00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.480
most of those sounds would be calls.

81
00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:51.902
Sometimes they occur
in series that change order.

82
00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:54.488
Sometimes they occur one by one.

83
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.869
But they're short.

84
00:11:01.662 --> 00:11:04.039
And we understand very little about them.

85
00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.169
But of all of the humpback calls...

86
00:11:10.087 --> 00:11:12.172
I think one is the most important.

87
00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:17.719
The whup.

88
00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:24.852
This call is produced.
we think. by everyone.

89
00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:30.232
This is an animal that has the potential
to produce infinite numbers of calls.

90
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.654
Why is this call unique?

91
00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:37.531
Why is this call special?

92
00:11:38.115 --> 00:11:41.618
And the best way to start finding that out

93
00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:44.621
is by playing it to a whale
and seeing how the whale responds.

94
00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:02.222
This is the question
I've been preparing for.

95
00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:08.979
This is the one that I fought for
when I was 25 and I started this.

96
00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:16.028
And this was the one that I rallied for
when I started my PhD.

97
00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.993
And I have to make sure
the science is impeccable.

98
00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.507
This is the very beginning
of how we understand

99
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.927
how humpback whales perceive the world.

100
00:12:41.595 --> 00:12:45.849
And how humpback whales
perceive each other through sound.

101
00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:13.252
My mum loved the ocean.

102
00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:20.342
And she always wanted
to be an oceanographer.

103
00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:22.928
but women weren't allowed out on boats.

104
00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:27.015
So she became a geographer instead.

105
00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:35.691
She never lost her love of the ocean.
and she definitely...

106
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.735
transmitted that on to me.

107
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.121
Exactly. That's an important thing.

108
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.585
Noting the weird. noting the different.
is the best thing you can do.

109
00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:56.920
Because that will jump out at you

110
00:13:57.004 --> 00:14:00.257
if we notice
these individual-level differences.

111
00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.593
Make a note.

112
00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:07.055
Scientists had always thought
that songs were only used for mating.

113
00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:08.765
We got a nice pattern.

114
00:14:08.849 --> 00:14:12.186
So. a violin. a bark.

115
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:14.229
and I'm pretty sure
that's gonna be a whup.

116
00:14:14.313 --> 00:14:17.399
So these are. like. three perfect exam--

117
00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:28.452
But as I listened to a decade
of recordings from the South Pacific.

118
00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:30.370
I saw the same songs turning up

119
00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:33.040
in populations separated by
hundreds of miles.

120
00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:37.044
But it's important
that we're seeing the structure. right.

121
00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:40.672
So we've got a big squeak.
and then a lower frequency unit.

122
00:14:40.756 --> 00:14:43.592
then the big squeak
and some lower frequency.

123
00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:46.094
And so. if you think about it
as a structural thing...

124
00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:50.724
I've realized song
had to be much more than just mating.

125
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.647
Small changes are introduced to the song.

126
00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:03.946
And then all of the singers learn
those changes and the song evolves.

127
00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:06.949
It steps forward.

128
00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:12.037
Songs are then passed
across distant populations.

129
00:15:13.539 --> 00:15:15.499
And as this repeats.

130
00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:20.045
they become the shape of what thousands
of whales sound like collectively.

131
00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:26.635
All of this is a cultural phenomenon.

132
00:15:28.095 --> 00:15:29.471
So. from Australia.

133
00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:33.267
it first spreads to New Caledonia.
800 miles away.

134
00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:37.646
They all learn the song
within a couple of months.

135
00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:40.065
which is ridiculous that animals can learn

136
00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:43.443
this very long.
complex display so rapidly.

137
00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:49.116
The songs go from west to east every time.

138
00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:52.035
connecting an ocean of whales
with culture.

139
00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.248
I'm trying to complete a map

140
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.959
of where song sharing is found
in the South Pacific.

141
00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:03.088
To find its edges.

142
00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:08.135
To find out where
this humpback culture ends.

143
00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:46.131
-Enough? No ways.
-No. I think that's enough. Stuff it in.

144
00:16:46.215 --> 00:16:48.425
Come on. Zin. What's this?

145
00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:52.054
Up here.

146
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.598
What do you think. Zin?

147
00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.018
Seem all right?

148
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.440
Fieldwork's always a challenge.

149
00:17:03.524 --> 00:17:07.653
'cause you're away
from people you care about.

150
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:12.950
But I thought...

151
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:17.412
On occasion. I've managed to get Matt
to come to the field site with me.

152
00:17:20.207 --> 00:17:22.125
And we discovered
he gets seasick on boats.

153
00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:24.502
So... that didn't work so well.

154
00:17:25.087 --> 00:17:26.672
You need to put the stove fire off.

155
00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.549
-I know. I know. I know!
-See the smoke?

156
00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:30.759
Did you open the-- Yeah.

157
00:17:30.843 --> 00:17:33.095
Step one. Ellen always sets off
the smoke alarms.

158
00:17:36.098 --> 00:17:38.058
-You all right?
-Yeah.

159
00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:42.563
Thanks. buddy.

160
00:17:45.524 --> 00:17:47.484
I don't even know where to start. Okay.

161
00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:49.820
-Delegate. Ellen.
-Pardon?

162
00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:52.865
Delegate. Delegate things to me.

163
00:17:52.948 --> 00:17:54.157
Okay.

164
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:58.620
Can you get all the stuff
off the washing line that is dry.

165
00:17:58.704 --> 00:17:59.830
Yes. I can.

166
00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:07.546
You know. we have absolute
minimal communication coming up.

167
00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:08.714
and that sucks.

168
00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:10.090
And it's really hard.

169
00:18:10.174 --> 00:18:12.426
And I think it's much harder
for you than me.

170
00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:16.471
because I'm surrounded constantly
by people-- by the team.

171
00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:19.016
Plus. you've got something to do. right?

172
00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.768
There's no rest. really. on fieldwork.

173
00:18:21.852 --> 00:18:25.189
When you're really interested in something
and really passionate about it.

174
00:18:25.272 --> 00:18:27.608
it's just the obvious thing
you want to do.

175
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:29.359
I love being in the field.

176
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.363
It makes me super happy.
and I absolutely love it.

177
00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:36.450
And I wouldn't want to stop doing that.

178
00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:38.243
but it is really hard to go away.

179
00:18:38.327 --> 00:18:41.079
It's just best to try
and not think about it. I guess.

180
00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:49.379
Okay.

181
00:18:51.173 --> 00:18:52.466
Come here.

182
00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:54.468
There we go.

183
00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:51.108
Four hydrophones. Check. Remote. Check.

184
00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:54.403
Four dry bags with collars
and GPS units. Check.

185
00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:59.324
Tracker. check. Small black dry bag
with boat GPS unit. check.

186
00:19:59.408 --> 00:20:02.452
iPad. check.
Green towel is in the backpack.

187
00:20:02.536 --> 00:20:04.288
Goal Zero battery with charging cords

188
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:06.832
and a Goal Zero solar panel
are both in the backpack.

189
00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:08.750
-Black Pelican.
-Check.

190
00:20:08.834 --> 00:20:10.961
With camera--
I checked it this morning.

191
00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:13.255
Camera. binos.
an extra nine-volt camera battery

192
00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:15.174
and double-A batteries are all in there.

193
00:20:15.257 --> 00:20:19.803
Awesome. Big yellow dry bag.
rain jackets. lunch snacks.

194
00:20:19.887 --> 00:20:21.388
Check. check. check.

195
00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:24.683
Okay. Playback speaker.
Four life jackets.

196
00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:25.767
Yep.

197
00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:27.519
-Two radios.
-Check.

198
00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:31.398
-Personal dry bags and water bottles.
-Water.

199
00:20:32.024 --> 00:20:33.483
I've got my water bottles full.

200
00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:35.110
Sunscreen.

201
00:20:35.194 --> 00:20:37.404
Oh. sunscreen.
which I wrote on the list.

202
00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:40.490
It's in the bag.
We should put it on our faces.

203
00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:52.336
We'll do our first survey down south.
and then we'll work our way north.

204
00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:53.754
Okay.

205
00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:02.804
When you're in a place of such beauty.
it's easy to forget...

206
00:21:04.306 --> 00:21:06.391
the whales could capsize us.

207
00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:09.811
And the water is cold enough
that we would die.

208
00:21:50.227 --> 00:21:51.854
There's somebody out there.

209
00:21:51.937 --> 00:21:53.063
For sure.

210
00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:06.118
In past seasons.
I've gone weeks without seeing any whales.

211
00:22:07.744 --> 00:22:11.123
This year we have only a month
to survey at least 30.

212
00:22:22.634 --> 00:22:27.181
Okay. hydrophones.
it is 10:28. August 11th.

213
00:22:27.264 --> 00:22:30.309
This is Dr. Leanna Matthews
here with Dr. Michelle Fournet.

214
00:22:30.392 --> 00:22:32.477
I'm going to clap three times.

215
00:22:37.107 --> 00:22:39.109
Each playback takes one hour.

216
00:22:44.489 --> 00:22:47.576
Below. we'll acoustically track
one whale with hydrophones

217
00:22:47.659 --> 00:22:50.162
while our speaker plays whups.

218
00:22:52.623 --> 00:22:54.041
Starting playback.

219
00:22:56.043 --> 00:23:00.047
And above.
we'll note everything we see one whale do.

220
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.632
This is called a focal follow.

221
00:23:03.509 --> 00:23:07.596
By linking behaviors we see at the surface
with recordings below the water.

222
00:23:08.222 --> 00:23:12.434
I'll have a complete picture of how
the whale is responding to our playbacks.

223
00:23:12.518 --> 00:23:15.270
-We'll start at first surface.
-Yeah.

224
00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:36.375
Feel like she's gonna pop up
right next to us.

225
00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:37.835
Yeah.

226
00:23:54.059 --> 00:23:55.561
Start survey.

227
00:23:55.644 --> 00:23:58.772
First surface. Southwest. 76.2.

228
00:24:05.821 --> 00:24:06.947
Blow.

229
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.866
Never mind. Scratch that.
Not our whale.

230
00:24:08.949 --> 00:24:10.659
-That's not our whale.
-No.

231
00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.871
Blow. West.

232
00:24:14.955 --> 00:24:16.039
50.1.

233
00:24:22.296 --> 00:24:25.090
Blow. Northwest.

234
00:24:28.468 --> 00:24:31.138
Dive. 36.3.

235
00:24:33.182 --> 00:24:34.183
150.

236
00:24:35.017 --> 00:24:37.019
-It is our whale.
-Yeah. That's our whale.

237
00:24:37.102 --> 00:24:39.188
Okay. A little white on the dorsal.

238
00:24:39.271 --> 00:24:40.272
-Right?
-Yeah.

239
00:24:40.355 --> 00:24:42.024
Yeah. The fluke just made me feel better.

240
00:24:42.107 --> 00:24:43.859
'Cause that other whale
was also a black-fluke whale.

241
00:24:43.942 --> 00:24:45.485
I noticed that.
and I was like. "Oh. my God."

242
00:24:45.569 --> 00:24:47.404
-But no. This is our whale.
-And that was the right fluke.

243
00:24:47.487 --> 00:24:48.822
-That was the right fluke.
-Yeah.

244
00:24:48.906 --> 00:24:51.408
Black fluke with kind of speckles.
Barnacles on the top.

245
00:24:51.491 --> 00:24:53.160
-Yep. Yep.
-Yeah.

246
00:24:53.243 --> 00:24:55.370
Okay. That's the end of our survey.

247
00:25:05.714 --> 00:25:06.965
-Contact.
-Contact.

248
00:25:07.049 --> 00:25:09.384
-Contact.
-Contact.

249
00:25:09.468 --> 00:25:11.094
-Contact.
-Contact.

250
00:25:11.178 --> 00:25:12.513
Contact.

251
00:25:31.406 --> 00:25:33.825
Does anybody mind
if I take the cheddar one?

252
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:35.285
Go for it.

253
00:25:39.456 --> 00:25:42.167
Are you guys disappointed
that I'm not taking us down there?

254
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:45.379
-No.
-Okay.

255
00:25:45.462 --> 00:25:46.672
It's intentional.

256
00:25:47.548 --> 00:25:49.716
There are too many whales down there.

257
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.552
I don't think we should go down there.

258
00:25:51.635 --> 00:25:53.428
It could get really confusing.

259
00:26:03.981 --> 00:26:05.524
-That's not our whale.
-Correct.

260
00:26:07.067 --> 00:26:08.235
That's not our whale.

261
00:26:10.404 --> 00:26:12.322
-These two are not our whales.
-Correct.

262
00:26:27.462 --> 00:26:29.548
Oh. what about that splashing whale?

263
00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:30.799
-Yeah.
-That's our whale.

264
00:26:31.592 --> 00:26:35.220
Surface. First surface. 185.2.

265
00:26:37.181 --> 00:26:38.182
200.

266
00:26:39.266 --> 00:26:40.851
I'm pretty sure it's our whale.

267
00:26:41.977 --> 00:26:43.770
I'm gonna try and get it in the binos.

268
00:26:49.526 --> 00:26:50.944
Blow.

269
00:26:51.028 --> 00:26:53.655
South. 178.5.

270
00:26:53.739 --> 00:26:56.074
-400. The closer one. yeah?
-Yep.

271
00:27:04.208 --> 00:27:06.668
-That's not our whale.
-That's not our whale.

272
00:27:07.544 --> 00:27:09.796
Delete that whole last surfacing.

273
00:27:15.677 --> 00:27:19.431
This study
has a high probability of failure.

274
00:27:23.519 --> 00:27:25.229
The logistics are really complicated.

275
00:27:31.443 --> 00:27:35.781
When there are multiple whales.
it's really hard to track just one.

276
00:27:58.095 --> 00:28:03.433
It's the idea that I might be
able to contribute to this knowledge.

277
00:28:03.517 --> 00:28:07.479
That that might be my little piece
that I can help with the puzzle.

278
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:15.612
Even in the hardest field season
or the crappiest day.

279
00:28:15.696 --> 00:28:17.698
it gets me out of bed every morning.

280
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.035
I'm a nerdy scientist...

281
00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.080
trying to understand our planet.

282
00:28:25.163 --> 00:28:27.416
trying to understand
all the animals on our planet

283
00:28:27.499 --> 00:28:29.418
before they disappear.

284
00:28:37.926 --> 00:28:41.430
So. you haven't had much
instruction with a hydrophone before?

285
00:28:41.513 --> 00:28:43.348
-Not much. no.
-Okay. cool.

286
00:28:43.432 --> 00:28:48.520
So. general idea. this part can't get wet.
that part has to go underwater.

287
00:28:50.147 --> 00:28:52.649
These take ages to wake up
on stamina mode.

288
00:28:52.733 --> 00:28:53.734
Yeah. right.

289
00:28:54.443 --> 00:28:56.069
I can hear that through there.

290
00:28:58.989 --> 00:29:01.533
Yeah. that's definitely doing well.

291
00:29:02.534 --> 00:29:07.080
So the whole idea is you
pop on a piece of tape.

292
00:29:07.164 --> 00:29:10.626
and then you want to wind it tight
but not too tight.

293
00:29:10.709 --> 00:29:12.794
-Right.
-You don't wanna strangulate the cord.

294
00:29:12.878 --> 00:29:14.087
Okay.

295
00:29:14.171 --> 00:29:16.965
And the idea for this is to reduce
the water frequency rumble?

296
00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:19.009
-That was what you were saying?
-Yeah. It...

297
00:29:19.092 --> 00:29:21.678
-reduces those low-frequency vibrations.
-Yeah.

298
00:29:21.762 --> 00:29:25.557
So. yeah. this has been passed down
from my supervisor's supervisor

299
00:29:25.641 --> 00:29:30.062
to him. to myself. and now
I'm sort of introducing it to our lab.

300
00:29:30.145 --> 00:29:31.522
So it's the--

301
00:29:31.605 --> 00:29:34.608
It's the Australian technique.
shall we say.

302
00:29:34.691 --> 00:29:37.194
-Yeah. No. that's perfect.
-Okay.

303
00:29:37.861 --> 00:29:39.363
Now we just need the whales.

304
00:29:41.532 --> 00:29:43.659
Yeah. I'm very happy to see you too.

305
00:29:43.742 --> 00:29:46.286
-So glad we can come out with you.
-Long time.

306
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.413
I know. I know. It's been ages.
Yeah. so...

307
00:29:48.497 --> 00:29:50.374
I only have a couple of weeks.

308
00:29:50.457 --> 00:29:53.961
and I need to get high-quality recordings
from different whales.

309
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.338
so I know what's being sung.

310
00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.730
Sorry about that. What do you reckon?

311
00:30:13.814 --> 00:30:17.276
Maybe try there. For the sound. is better.

312
00:30:17.359 --> 00:30:19.570
-Yeah. Sounds like--
-And after we can go...

313
00:30:19.653 --> 00:30:20.946
Yeah. That's the best idea.

314
00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:43.093
-Happy to go in?
-Yep. ready to go in.

315
00:30:52.811 --> 00:30:56.815
-Uncoil it-- Yep. Perfect.
-There we are.

316
00:30:56.899 --> 00:30:59.359
-Right. We're gonna start listening now.
-Okay.

317
00:31:06.283 --> 00:31:08.327
I'm listening at level 95.

318
00:31:21.298 --> 00:31:23.675
It may be at the very edge of my hearing.

319
00:31:24.426 --> 00:31:25.928
It might be. yeah.

320
00:31:26.011 --> 00:31:28.305
It's a game of acoustic hide-and-seek.

321
00:31:29.348 --> 00:31:32.893
Let's let all of the--
Yeah. all the cable out.

322
00:31:32.976 --> 00:31:34.811
'Cause it's not sitting vertical.

323
00:31:34.895 --> 00:31:38.023
and I'd rather get
as much depth as we can.

324
00:31:39.441 --> 00:31:41.902
Below the surface. a song can be heard

325
00:31:41.985 --> 00:31:45.072
by other whales for dozens of miles.

326
00:31:45.155 --> 00:31:49.743
But my hydrophone struggles
to record clearly beyond a mile or two.

327
00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:59.878
Okay. I'm gonna stop that now. File 001.

328
00:32:00.963 --> 00:32:02.798
-Feel it from this way.
-Yeah.

329
00:32:08.303 --> 00:32:10.430
The whales sing outside the reef.

330
00:32:10.514 --> 00:32:12.808
but the deeper waters can get so big

331
00:32:12.891 --> 00:32:15.602
that if you're not careful.
it could sink the boat.

332
00:32:16.937 --> 00:32:19.481
Let's try down-- Over there.

333
00:32:20.774 --> 00:32:24.653
The water is a window.
but it's also a wall.

334
00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:36.915
We can confirm
we do have singing going on.

335
00:32:36.999 --> 00:32:39.877
but it is poor to very poor.

336
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.214
Which means he's a long way out.
We can't go into that. unfortunately.

337
00:33:08.614 --> 00:33:12.868
Ten years in Alaska
and I have never seen so many whales.

338
00:33:13.702 --> 00:33:17.039
I think we're doing a
disservice to the playback if we don't...

339
00:33:17.831 --> 00:33:18.832
do a scan.

340
00:33:18.916 --> 00:33:21.126
Like. we're focal following this animal

341
00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:24.046
and doing a playback to this animal.

342
00:33:24.129 --> 00:33:26.882
but that's not the only animal
that hears this playback.

343
00:33:26.965 --> 00:33:29.760
Which means that what the animal does
is going to change.

344
00:33:29.843 --> 00:33:32.387
Because you and I having a dialogue alone

345
00:33:32.471 --> 00:33:36.517
versus you and I having a dialogue
with a group of people

346
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.560
is going to change how much we contribute.

347
00:33:38.644 --> 00:33:40.312
-Yes!
-And how much we pay attention.

348
00:33:40.395 --> 00:33:42.481
I think we're having trouble letting go.

349
00:33:42.564 --> 00:33:45.734
Sure. We spent weeks--
I spent months-- I spent years...

350
00:33:45.817 --> 00:33:49.571
-A long time.
-...designing these focal follows.

351
00:33:49.655 --> 00:33:52.491
-But when you get there and you do it...
-It changes.

352
00:33:52.574 --> 00:33:54.910
...and you're seeing all
these other things...

353
00:33:54.993 --> 00:33:57.621
It doesn't matter how much time
I spent designing it.

354
00:33:57.704 --> 00:34:00.415
So what it the most elegant way

355
00:34:00.499 --> 00:34:03.919
to be certain
about something we see in nature

356
00:34:04.002 --> 00:34:08.257
without exaggerating it.
without hoping for it?

357
00:34:09.132 --> 00:34:12.678
And I feel like.
in terms of that question...

358
00:34:14.554 --> 00:34:21.270
A scan is the simplest way to capture
the response of a playback.

359
00:34:22.563 --> 00:34:23.772
Strong pivot.

360
00:34:24.898 --> 00:34:25.983
Very strong.

361
00:34:31.362 --> 00:34:32.989
-I think we're--
-Hey. Maggie.

362
00:34:33.072 --> 00:34:35.284
We're making some changes to the protocol.

363
00:34:35.367 --> 00:34:37.369
-It's gonna be scans.
-Just scans?

364
00:34:37.452 --> 00:34:38.704
-Yes.
-Scans only?

365
00:34:38.786 --> 00:34:40.163
Scans only.

366
00:34:41.206 --> 00:34:44.001
I thought I was only gonna have one whale.

367
00:34:44.083 --> 00:34:47.713
so it made a lot of sense
to look at what one whale did.

368
00:34:49.922 --> 00:34:54.678
Instead. I have lots of whales.
which was an unexpected surprise.

369
00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.433
So I need to know whether or not

370
00:34:59.516 --> 00:35:02.978
the number of whups
that each whale is producing

371
00:35:03.061 --> 00:35:05.189
goes up when I produce a whup.

372
00:35:08.358 --> 00:35:11.486
And the best way to do this
is to start doing scans.

373
00:35:13.197 --> 00:35:15.908
I mark every whale
that I can see all around me.

374
00:35:17.868 --> 00:35:20.954
If. on average.
how many whups each whale is making

375
00:35:21.038 --> 00:35:23.498
goes up when I produce a whup call...

376
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.546
that's really strong evidence
that they're using whups to make contact.

377
00:36:20.138 --> 00:36:21.723
Starting playback.

378
00:36:55.924 --> 00:36:56.925
Okay.

379
00:37:01.221 --> 00:37:03.682
We're gonna head that way
to give some space.

380
00:37:03.765 --> 00:37:07.644
And then we'll cut back.
Slow. we're gonna go slow.

381
00:37:15.402 --> 00:37:18.780
-Thirty seconds out from playback.
-Thank you. Thirty seconds.

382
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:31.126
Group size. four. 131. 500.

383
00:37:33.295 --> 00:37:38.717
Group size. two. 154. 1.000.

384
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.386
145. Group size. two.

385
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.805
-Can you slow down just a little?
-Barely.

386
00:37:45.015 --> 00:37:47.100
Range. 200.

387
00:37:47.184 --> 00:37:48.852
Please repeat that azimuth.

388
00:37:48.936 --> 00:37:50.229
142.

389
00:37:51.939 --> 00:37:53.565
Group size. two...

390
00:37:58.403 --> 00:38:00.531
250 yards.

391
00:38:00.614 --> 00:38:03.909
185. Group size. one.

392
00:38:05.202 --> 00:38:09.331
-Please repeat that. I'm sorry.
-185. Group size. one. 250 yards.

393
00:38:12.042 --> 00:38:15.379
200 yards. Group size. one. 256.

394
00:38:15.462 --> 00:38:18.382
I am at group size four at 1.000.

395
00:38:19.383 --> 00:38:21.635
-What was the azimuth?
-I don't know.

396
00:38:23.762 --> 00:38:25.889
All right. Let's stop and start over.

397
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.562
It's really. really fast. and I haven't
had time to really look at this.

398
00:38:31.645 --> 00:38:33.188
I know. And it's--

399
00:38:33.272 --> 00:38:35.482
Let's delete all of those and start again.

400
00:38:38.527 --> 00:38:41.655
As hard as that was. it was easier.

401
00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.618
Than trying to focal follow
one animal in all of that?

402
00:38:46.702 --> 00:38:48.912
Yeah. Look at these guys.
Look at that.

403
00:39:00.591 --> 00:39:02.426
All right. Start survey.

404
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.348
All right. Group size. three. 159.

405
00:39:22.696 --> 00:39:24.239
I kind of wanna see us.

406
00:39:24.907 --> 00:39:26.992
-When did we start playing back?
-11:32.

407
00:39:32.873 --> 00:39:35.667
-That sounds right.
-I think that's us. It's quiet.

408
00:39:35.751 --> 00:39:37.669
But again. like. it fits right in.

409
00:39:37.753 --> 00:39:40.631
It fits right in. Oh. yeah.
It sounds very. very realistic.

410
00:39:43.675 --> 00:39:44.801
Yeah.

411
00:39:51.225 --> 00:39:52.893
-That's not us.
-No. it's not.

412
00:39:52.976 --> 00:39:55.020
-No. we're over here. This is us.
-Yeah.

413
00:40:01.443 --> 00:40:04.279
I think the whup is a kind of
hello to them.

414
00:40:05.364 --> 00:40:09.409
Possibly. "Hello. I am..."

415
00:40:11.954 --> 00:40:13.330
Which raises the question...

416
00:40:15.207 --> 00:40:17.209
if each whale has their own whup...

417
00:40:18.544 --> 00:40:20.546
could they use it to identify each other?

418
00:40:25.509 --> 00:40:28.637
This is why I'm playing this sound.

419
00:40:29.555 --> 00:40:31.598
Before you can have the conversation...

420
00:40:33.308 --> 00:40:34.977
it helps to introduce yourself.

421
00:40:37.104 --> 00:40:40.232
So. what else did we find in here?

422
00:40:40.315 --> 00:40:43.819
We wanted to see if they were whupping
before we started whupping. right?

423
00:40:44.361 --> 00:40:46.363
-That's us.
-And that's us.

424
00:40:46.446 --> 00:40:49.241
We don't see a lot of whupping
before we started whupping.

425
00:40:54.329 --> 00:40:56.123
They insist on calling back.

426
00:41:02.045 --> 00:41:03.881
Now. it could just be random chance.

427
00:41:03.964 --> 00:41:05.465
Here they go again.

428
00:41:13.056 --> 00:41:14.224
-Oh. Leanna.
-What's up?

429
00:41:14.308 --> 00:41:15.809
-Here. come here.
-Okay.

430
00:41:15.893 --> 00:41:19.062
-Maggie. We need a push.
-Oh. God.

431
00:41:20.147 --> 00:41:21.690
-Oh. God.
-We hit the ground.

432
00:41:21.773 --> 00:41:23.108
It creaks.

433
00:41:24.067 --> 00:41:26.486
I'm not helping.
I'm not taking part in this.

434
00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:28.488
I will not be sued
if something goes wrong.

435
00:41:28.572 --> 00:41:31.116
Are we on the ground?
I think we the hit ground.

436
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.160
I'm gonna stand up here
and judge you.

437
00:41:33.243 --> 00:41:34.828
Are you saying we can't swing?

438
00:41:34.912 --> 00:41:37.998
Well. if we go further that way.
there's less ground. right?

439
00:41:40.334 --> 00:41:42.544
-Ready?
-Oh. my God. I'm in tears.

440
00:41:45.547 --> 00:41:47.758
Oh. my God. I'm gonna pee in my pants.

441
00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:49.051
Oh. yeah. Oh. Maggie.

442
00:41:52.346 --> 00:41:54.973
-Here. be careful.
-This seems like a really bad idea.

443
00:41:55.057 --> 00:41:56.975
-Can you get your feet up there?
-Probably.

444
00:41:57.059 --> 00:41:59.186
I bet if you hold the stick higher-- Yeah.

445
00:41:59.269 --> 00:42:01.104
Yeah. you're just gonna have to jump.

446
00:42:01.188 --> 00:42:02.481
Jump and straddle. Oh. God.

447
00:42:04.233 --> 00:42:06.193
Oh. God. Don't let her hit the tree.

448
00:42:38.141 --> 00:42:40.644
I take things that I love about being here

449
00:42:40.727 --> 00:42:42.771
and set them up in my home.

450
00:42:42.855 --> 00:42:43.856
Like what?

451
00:42:43.939 --> 00:42:45.399
Like. I don't have the Internet.

452
00:42:45.482 --> 00:42:47.442
Yeah.
You don't have Internet at your house?

453
00:42:47.526 --> 00:42:49.987
-Yeah. I don't have Internet at my house.
-Yeah.

454
00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:51.697
It's really quiet at my house.

455
00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:53.532
I'm far away from noise.

456
00:42:53.615 --> 00:42:56.076
so that when I step outside.
it sounds a little bit...

457
00:42:56.159 --> 00:42:57.160
Yeah.

458
00:42:57.244 --> 00:43:00.163
When I wake up in the morning.
it feels kind of like waking up in a tent.

459
00:43:00.247 --> 00:43:04.084
Yeah. Transitioning out of being here
is exponentially harder.

460
00:43:04.168 --> 00:43:08.172
It takes days to recalibrate

461
00:43:08.255 --> 00:43:11.216
to reality and the real world.
and it's just...

462
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.553
That's where I-- That's the thing.
is I don't feel like that is reality.

463
00:43:14.636 --> 00:43:15.929
I feel like this is reality.

464
00:43:16.013 --> 00:43:18.599
This is the real world.

465
00:43:18.682 --> 00:43:21.935
Yes. but this is not the real world
that we live in all the time.

466
00:43:22.019 --> 00:43:24.855
-Yes.
-So we have to reset

467
00:43:24.938 --> 00:43:28.317
to the day-to-day life
that we had before this.

468
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.651
And it's hard.

469
00:43:58.931 --> 00:44:01.183
Some things we do are not innate.

470
00:44:05.354 --> 00:44:06.438
They're learned.

471
00:44:10.275 --> 00:44:12.277
They tell us who we're connected to.

472
00:44:14.738 --> 00:44:15.864
And where we belong.

473
00:44:18.867 --> 00:44:20.661
We worked today.
We were a good team today.

474
00:44:20.744 --> 00:44:21.745
Yeah.

475
00:44:22.454 --> 00:44:24.164
We took good care of each other.

476
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:25.958
We laughed a lot.

477
00:44:26.041 --> 00:44:27.584
We laughed a lot today.

478
00:44:30.546 --> 00:44:32.214
You don't need me to cut your hair?

479
00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:41.431
We call these things culture.

480
00:44:50.232 --> 00:44:52.901
The oldest cultures are not human.

481
00:44:56.405 --> 00:44:57.906
They're from the ocean.

482
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.164
For generations.
researchers thought they were solitary

483
00:45:07.332 --> 00:45:09.001
when we didn't see them together.

484
00:45:14.882 --> 00:45:17.593
But they haven't been alone for eons.

485
00:45:21.471 --> 00:45:26.852
Forty million years ago.
their brains exploded with complexity.

486
00:45:28.979 --> 00:45:31.064
Before we walked upright.

487
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:34.902
Before we sparked fire.

488
00:45:37.404 --> 00:45:40.782
Consciousness bloomed
because they became social.

489
00:45:46.121 --> 00:45:49.666
Regions related to self and community

490
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:52.544
grew more elaborate
than in any other brain.

491
00:45:54.087 --> 00:45:55.464
Including us.

492
00:45:57.341 --> 00:46:00.302
The senses of sight and sound merged.

493
00:46:02.387 --> 00:46:05.974
Allowing whales to see one another
through sound.

494
00:46:09.269 --> 00:46:13.023
Whales evolved to build relationships
in the dark.

495
00:46:24.117 --> 00:46:26.537
-A tail.
-Where-- Tail on the left!

496
00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.372
I've got one there and one there.

497
00:46:36.129 --> 00:46:38.298
Okay. Recording at 13:50.

498
00:46:57.109 --> 00:47:00.070
Okay. we do have a singer.

499
00:47:07.744 --> 00:47:09.204
The moans are really...

500
00:47:09.288 --> 00:47:11.456
You can hear all the detail
in them. it's great.

501
00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:15.085
That's exactly what we want.
This is it. This is the one!

502
00:47:15.169 --> 00:47:18.255
This is the one.
We're gonna hold the cable for an hour.

503
00:47:18.338 --> 00:47:19.756
We're gonna-- This is our gold.

504
00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.842
-Like. this is our one for the season.
-Yeah.

505
00:47:41.028 --> 00:47:44.656
The song we recorded is different
from the one I've been tracking.

506
00:47:46.992 --> 00:47:49.703
A new song I've never heard before.

507
00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:55.709
In 20 years of song recordings
across the South Pacific.

508
00:47:55.792 --> 00:47:58.754
this is the first time
I've ever seen this happen.

509
00:48:01.131 --> 00:48:02.841
But I don't think it's an anomaly.

510
00:48:05.802 --> 00:48:10.015
The song has a complex structure
and fully formed themes.

511
00:48:14.186 --> 00:48:17.439
Maybe French Polynesia isn't the end
of the map.

512
00:48:35.916 --> 00:48:41.129
In a week. I lose
Leanna and Maggie to their day jobs.

513
00:48:42.464 --> 00:48:44.633
But I think we're finally
starting to get it.

514
00:48:46.552 --> 00:48:50.097
Since we've gone from tracking
one whale to dozens.

515
00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.432
the hardest part is
gauging distance by eye.

516
00:48:54.351 --> 00:48:57.145
So. every morning we practice.

517
00:48:57.229 --> 00:48:58.730
-Okay. my guess.
-Okay.

518
00:48:58.814 --> 00:49:00.607
-I--
-Okay. you first.

519
00:49:00.691 --> 00:49:02.526
I would say 125.

520
00:49:02.609 --> 00:49:05.153
-I said 150.
-I could see 150.

521
00:49:05.237 --> 00:49:06.613
170.

522
00:49:06.697 --> 00:49:09.616
I thought 150 to 200...
was my guess on that.

523
00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.368
Really? I was 100 to 150.

524
00:49:11.451 --> 00:49:13.203
-All right. Okay.
-I'm off.

525
00:49:15.998 --> 00:49:18.709
-150 to 200.
-I would say 150 to 200.

526
00:49:18.792 --> 00:49:20.752
Okay. range from-- Oh. God. don't move.

527
00:49:24.256 --> 00:49:25.465
It's 130.

528
00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.010
-We're a little under.
-Yeah.

529
00:49:28.093 --> 00:49:29.761
We're overestimating the distance.

530
00:49:31.471 --> 00:49:32.598
-Ready?
-Yeah.

531
00:49:33.974 --> 00:49:36.310
-Seventy-five.
-I would say 75.

532
00:49:36.393 --> 00:49:37.853
-Closer than a hundred.
-Seventy.

533
00:49:38.604 --> 00:49:40.939
-Okay. I'm feeling better.
-We're-- Yeah.

534
00:49:44.318 --> 00:49:47.154
-It's hot today.
-I'm so uncomfortable.

535
00:49:49.865 --> 00:49:52.451
You also look very. like.

536
00:49:52.534 --> 00:49:55.037
-French-girl-goes-into-the-field today.
-Really?

537
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.955
With the little bun and the solid black.

538
00:49:57.039 --> 00:50:00.876
Well. so. that's so that you can't see
my sweat stains in the black.

539
00:50:00.959 --> 00:50:03.587
and I can put my hair in a hat.

540
00:50:04.838 --> 00:50:05.923
Functional fashion.

541
00:50:06.006 --> 00:50:08.133
-Functional fashion.
-Yeah.

542
00:50:10.594 --> 00:50:13.013
I haven't changed shirts
in. like. six days.

543
00:50:16.892 --> 00:50:19.144
They're so spectacular.
There are so many whales.

544
00:50:19.978 --> 00:50:26.318
Just there. and there. and there.
and there. and there. and...

545
00:50:56.014 --> 00:50:57.140
Seriously?

546
00:51:00.811 --> 00:51:03.480
Leanna.
We've got fuel coming out of the back.

547
00:51:03.564 --> 00:51:04.815
-Okay. let's go home.
-Yeah.

548
00:51:09.444 --> 00:51:11.154
It's working.

549
00:51:29.923 --> 00:51:31.175
Yep. yep. yep.

550
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.172
I don't know exactly
where we're leaking from.

551
00:52:10.255 --> 00:52:12.090
so I need to figure that out.

552
00:52:12.174 --> 00:52:15.636
But I know that when I'm feeding it fuel.
that my intake is fine.

553
00:52:15.719 --> 00:52:17.679
but something's happening. I think...

554
00:52:19.306 --> 00:52:22.059
Not even gonna speculate right now.
But I'm working on it.

555
00:52:22.142 --> 00:52:23.227
Okay.

556
00:52:25.312 --> 00:52:27.648
Just know that.
probably for the next several hours.

557
00:52:27.731 --> 00:52:29.608
I will not have any extra bandwidth.

558
00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:33.362
and I will be in problem-solving mode
until the problem is solved.

559
00:52:33.445 --> 00:52:34.905
-Got it.
-Okay.

560
00:53:52.274 --> 00:53:54.234
Yeah. we're getting close to 20 minutes.

561
00:54:08.207 --> 00:54:09.374
Blow.

562
00:54:09.458 --> 00:54:11.126
Moving.

563
00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.967
Oh. yeah. And again.

564
00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.434
Blow.

565
00:54:27.518 --> 00:54:30.145
-Where? Blow?
-Blow?

566
00:54:34.775 --> 00:54:36.151
Yes. yes.

567
00:54:37.528 --> 00:54:40.072
Starting listening now.

568
00:54:59.258 --> 00:55:01.134
He's not a singer.

569
00:55:01.218 --> 00:55:03.929
He's not a singer. I know. I know.

570
00:55:04.012 --> 00:55:06.974
He's. like. right there. but... I know.

571
00:55:08.892 --> 00:55:11.395
-I call it needle in a haystack.
-Yeah.

572
00:55:11.478 --> 00:55:12.729
And you've just gotta--

573
00:55:12.813 --> 00:55:15.399
They're either gonna be there
and singing or they're not.

574
00:55:42.551 --> 00:55:45.888
So he's saying 4:00. 4:30
at the Marina de Vaiare.

575
00:55:45.971 --> 00:55:47.139
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

576
00:55:47.222 --> 00:55:49.474
Let's do it. I'm in. Great.

577
00:56:07.701 --> 00:56:09.286
Four. two...

578
00:56:11.371 --> 00:56:14.458
I just said that we didn't have
any good song.

579
00:56:14.541 --> 00:56:17.002
but it was good that we're out.
and it's good practice.

580
00:56:28.222 --> 00:56:31.099
And this end is the business end.
That's the hydrophone.

581
00:56:31.183 --> 00:56:34.144
Yeah. this is the hydrophone.
What we do is. when we cable tie it.

582
00:56:34.228 --> 00:56:37.105
we put the hydrophone up
and its tail down.

583
00:56:37.189 --> 00:56:39.983
So there's a weight on the ground
and a buoy. or-- Yeah.

584
00:56:40.067 --> 00:56:44.446
Yeah. We're putting it down on the reef
there and so there's a lot of fish around.

585
00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:46.281
-Get some really cool croakers.
-Right.

586
00:56:46.365 --> 00:56:48.742
Like. you're gonna hear
a lot of that. and...

587
00:56:48.825 --> 00:56:50.911
-There's snapping shrimp. but...
-Yeah.

588
00:56:50.994 --> 00:56:54.873
As long as you've got a close singer.
it just sort of overrides everything else.

589
00:56:59.294 --> 00:57:00.963
I'm doing everything I can

590
00:57:01.046 --> 00:57:04.174
to capture if something different
is happening here.

591
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.183
Okay.

592
00:57:13.267 --> 00:57:14.685
Yeah.

593
00:57:16.436 --> 00:57:19.481
It is the 10th of September.

594
00:57:19.565 --> 00:57:23.777
and we are currently just
off the reef in Mo'orea.

595
00:57:23.861 --> 00:57:27.030
If found. the soundtrack belongs
to Dr. Ellen Garland

596
00:57:27.114 --> 00:57:29.616
at the University of St. Andrews.

597
00:57:35.831 --> 00:57:38.375
We're placing hydrophones on the seafloor.

598
00:57:38.458 --> 00:57:40.669
hoping a singer swims close enough.

599
00:57:46.592 --> 00:57:50.387
All right. I'm gonna feed it.
Yeah. Right.

600
00:57:55.517 --> 00:57:58.437
We call our communication "language."

601
00:57:59.646 --> 00:58:02.774
We think what whales do is different.

602
00:58:11.033 --> 00:58:16.997
Underwater. sounds can take half an hour
to bend around the horizon.

603
00:58:18.165 --> 00:58:22.920
Or fade in a matter of seconds and feet.

604
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:27.216
Sounds constantly arrive...

605
00:58:28.842 --> 00:58:32.387
from different places and times.

606
00:58:39.436 --> 00:58:43.899
And somehow humpbacks decipher
an acoustic world

607
00:58:43.982 --> 00:58:48.403
where the past
and present arrive all at once.

608
00:58:56.495 --> 00:58:59.790
It's like knowing how each
of the stars fit within time...

609
00:59:01.875 --> 00:59:03.502
with just your ears.

610
00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.176
-How many whales have I marked?
-Six total.

611
00:59:52.259 --> 00:59:55.721
Six total. Whales. whales...

612
00:59:55.804 --> 00:59:58.724
Group size of two. group of three
and a single over there. Right?

613
00:59:58.807 --> 00:59:59.850
Yep.

614
00:59:59.933 --> 01:00:01.310
-That happens a lot.
-Yeah.

615
01:00:02.186 --> 01:00:03.270
Okay.

616
01:00:03.353 --> 01:00:05.189
-Okay.
-Time for my three-minute break?

617
01:00:06.565 --> 01:00:07.649
Yes.

618
01:00:07.733 --> 01:00:08.984
Breaching whale!

619
01:00:09.067 --> 01:00:12.321
-Well. we're out of our work.
-Yeah. but we can watch it.

620
01:00:12.404 --> 01:00:15.032
It's snack time.
Get the snacks. get the snacks.

621
01:00:15.115 --> 01:00:17.242
-Here. pocket cheese.
-Perfect. Thank you.

622
01:00:17.326 --> 01:00:18.493
Yeah.

623
01:00:18.577 --> 01:00:21.079
Then how far away do we go
before we do another survey?

624
01:00:21.163 --> 01:00:23.123
-One hour or four miles.
-Four miles.

625
01:00:23.207 --> 01:00:24.499
Excellent.

626
01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:27.586
How many surveys do we try
and do in a day?

627
01:00:27.669 --> 01:00:29.046
-Four.
-Four.

628
01:00:29.129 --> 01:00:31.089
How hungry are we gonna be
when we get home?

629
01:00:31.173 --> 01:00:32.966
-So.
-So hungry.

630
01:00:39.473 --> 01:00:41.308
There's a lot happening in this file.

631
01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:44.311
I'm not surprised.
There is a lot of whales around.

632
01:00:44.978 --> 01:00:46.813
Here's a little half feeding call.

633
01:00:51.985 --> 01:00:54.154
That's called an arches.
and then a droplet.

634
01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:57.241
Whup. feeding call. droplet.

635
01:00:57.324 --> 01:01:01.787
Droplet. droplet. droplet.

636
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:06.416
Feeding call. droplet. droplet. droplet.

637
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.043
How many of these did you name?

638
01:01:09.378 --> 01:01:10.504
I named all of those.

639
01:01:16.343 --> 01:01:17.928
You know what we call that call?

640
01:01:20.597 --> 01:01:21.598
Elephant.

641
01:01:21.682 --> 01:01:25.102
No. close. Think of another animal
that makes this sound. It might be dead.

642
01:01:25.185 --> 01:01:27.563
-Mammoth.
-Closer.

643
01:01:27.646 --> 01:01:28.856
Woolly mammoth.

644
01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:35.529
No. it's called the brontosaurus.

645
01:01:35.612 --> 01:01:37.531
It "may" be dead?

646
01:01:38.824 --> 01:01:40.409
Most certainly is dead.

647
01:01:41.201 --> 01:01:42.494
You tricked me.

648
01:01:43.328 --> 01:01:45.414
They do remind me of brontosauruses.

649
01:01:45.497 --> 01:01:46.790
-Brontosauri.
-I agree.

650
01:01:49.376 --> 01:01:51.628
-That sounds like a brontosaurus.
-Yeah. it does.

651
01:02:39.259 --> 01:02:42.471
Three more days until I get a new engine.

652
01:02:52.523 --> 01:02:57.277
We're trying to answer the question.
"Is the whup a contact call?"

653
01:03:01.073 --> 01:03:02.741
And we are running out of time.

654
01:03:06.578 --> 01:03:07.746
We're creating a record.

655
01:03:09.414 --> 01:03:11.834
So that we can at least demonstrate
to the world

656
01:03:11.917 --> 01:03:13.460
and to the generations ahead of us

657
01:03:13.544 --> 01:03:15.087
that something beautiful was here.

658
01:03:32.396 --> 01:03:37.109
To answer these questions.
I have to remove myself from society.

659
01:03:39.987 --> 01:03:43.156
And live in a world
that is dominated with animals.

660
01:03:47.244 --> 01:03:50.247
And it doesn't feel like a sacrifice.

661
01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:54.209
It feels like a release.

662
01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:16.523
I know I'm gonna come home
a different person.

663
01:04:16.607 --> 01:04:18.942
And I don't know if
that person's gonna fit...

664
01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:21.612
the role that I had before.

665
01:04:25.574 --> 01:04:28.702
Like. I went to Antarctica for a month

666
01:04:28.785 --> 01:04:32.789
and came home to a dog and a partner

667
01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:35.792
that I didn't fit into anymore.

668
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.170
And I had to leave them.

669
01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:43.300
And I'm terrified
that's gonna happen again.

670
01:04:43.383 --> 01:04:44.510
-You know?
-Yeah.

671
01:04:44.593 --> 01:04:47.930
I'm terrified I'm not gonna fit
into that role that I had when I left.

672
01:04:49.264 --> 01:04:50.265
You have to leave it.

673
01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:53.101
but not just leave it physically.
but also leave it mentally.

674
01:04:54.061 --> 01:04:56.396
You've come into the field
for seven seasons.

675
01:04:58.732 --> 01:05:01.902
Have you found a way to come home?

676
01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:03.195
No.

677
01:05:04.071 --> 01:05:05.656
No.

678
01:05:05.739 --> 01:05:07.032
Instead...

679
01:05:08.033 --> 01:05:11.787
I do the opposite. and I take the things
that are precious to me about home.

680
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:14.248
like you. and bring them here.

681
01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.961
Which seems to make more sense.

682
01:05:20.379 --> 01:05:23.006
Because this is a much safer place
to be a human.

683
01:05:38.939 --> 01:05:42.025
I've never seen so few whales
this late in the season.

684
01:05:43.569 --> 01:05:45.737
And we've only captured
one clear recording.

685
01:05:57.708 --> 01:06:00.043
Right. Hydrophone going down.

686
01:06:03.547 --> 01:06:05.549
-Moving nicely.
-Excellent.

687
01:06:06.425 --> 01:06:07.759
I'm gonna do data.

688
01:06:07.843 --> 01:06:11.805
because we don't wanna be out here
for any longer than we have to.

689
01:06:23.817 --> 01:06:25.819
Can I have a time? I'm listening now.

690
01:06:25.903 --> 01:06:27.654
8:29.

691
01:06:27.738 --> 01:06:30.115
-Okay. recording.
-Cool.

692
01:07:08.862 --> 01:07:10.072
This is frustrating.

693
01:07:12.032 --> 01:07:15.869
We've got so much water noise.
And so much splashing.

694
01:07:15.953 --> 01:07:19.998
I think we might have to call it at 25.
I just-- This is getting--

695
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:23.293
This is getting challenging.

696
01:07:27.005 --> 01:07:31.134
I am just exhausted from everything.

697
01:07:35.347 --> 01:07:38.725
To talk about that it's hard.
that it's challenging.

698
01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:40.894
can sometimes be a sign of weakness.

699
01:07:48.861 --> 01:07:53.532
Particularly being female in this field.
you don't want to show any weakness.

700
01:08:28.483 --> 01:08:32.069
This year. I promised that I would only
go on fieldwork for two weeks.

701
01:08:37.242 --> 01:08:38.410
I miss Matt.

702
01:08:40.703 --> 01:08:44.416
It feels like a lifetime ago
we were able to see each other's faces.

703
01:09:34.591 --> 01:09:37.051
It is Tuesday. August 27th.

704
01:09:37.135 --> 01:09:38.804
This is Dr. Michelle Fournet.

705
01:09:38.886 --> 01:09:42.599
here with almost-but-not-yet-doctor
Natalie Mastick.

706
01:09:48.145 --> 01:09:50.314
Okay. All right.

707
01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:55.112
Is he... closer to the others?

708
01:09:55.195 --> 01:09:58.240
Lot of. lot of. lot of whales.
Whoo. there's a lot of whales.

709
01:10:00.492 --> 01:10:02.786
-Okay.
-That's my favorite problem.

710
01:10:03.829 --> 01:10:05.914
It's a good problem. Look at 'em.

711
01:10:05.998 --> 01:10:07.708
Look!

712
01:10:20.637 --> 01:10:21.847
Perfect.

713
01:10:21.930 --> 01:10:25.893
Okay. blue is secured on the anchor.

714
01:10:25.976 --> 01:10:28.645
Blue is now in the water.

715
01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:30.272
Blue is in the water.

716
01:10:38.947 --> 01:10:41.742
Is the volume turned up
all the way on the iPad?

717
01:10:43.243 --> 01:10:44.870
-Yes.
-It is?

718
01:10:46.914 --> 01:10:49.875
-Play it again. Is it playing?
-It's playing.

719
01:10:52.336 --> 01:10:54.129
-We didn't put it in the water.
-Shoot.

720
01:10:55.297 --> 01:10:57.174
-All right. stop it.
-Oh. no.

721
01:11:01.136 --> 01:11:02.513
All right. Are you ready?

722
01:11:03.931 --> 01:11:05.641
I don't know. That was very stressful.

723
01:11:05.724 --> 01:11:07.518
-Yes. ready.
-Okay. Go.

724
01:11:12.064 --> 01:11:16.235
One. Two. Three. four. five.

725
01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:20.531
Six. seven. eight. nine. ten. eleven.

726
01:11:22.908 --> 01:11:25.827
Ready? And begin.

727
01:11:26.995 --> 01:11:28.956
We have a group of two.

728
01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:32.835
Three singles. One group of four. And two.

729
01:11:33.418 --> 01:11:36.213
Right here. I think there's one here.

730
01:11:36.296 --> 01:11:38.048
Survey number 26.

731
01:11:39.508 --> 01:11:40.843
That's time.

732
01:11:41.885 --> 01:11:45.472
Group size. three. 145.6.

733
01:11:46.348 --> 01:11:49.768
Group of two. 356.1.

734
01:11:51.144 --> 01:11:52.396
Group of one.

735
01:11:54.731 --> 01:11:56.608
129.6.

736
01:11:58.235 --> 01:12:00.112
200 to 500.

737
01:12:08.912 --> 01:12:11.123
I feel my age for the first time.

738
01:12:12.165 --> 01:12:13.375
And I wanna have a baby.

739
01:12:14.710 --> 01:12:17.504
What are you gonna do with your baby
when you're in the field?

740
01:12:18.672 --> 01:12:20.007
You're gonna bring him out.

741
01:12:22.217 --> 01:12:23.302
It's a hard question.

742
01:12:23.385 --> 01:12:25.345
It depends on what kind of fieldwork I do.

743
01:12:25.429 --> 01:12:28.307
Depends on what kind of partner I have
when I do that fieldwork.

744
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:31.393
If I have a partner who can join me
in the field. yeah.

745
01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:34.188
If I have a support group of people.

746
01:12:35.439 --> 01:12:36.982
Like. I'm dead serious.

747
01:12:37.065 --> 01:12:38.817
-We do a one-month field season.
-Yeah.

748
01:12:38.901 --> 01:12:40.944
And somebody picks blueberries
with the kids.

749
01:12:41.028 --> 01:12:42.905
and makes pancakes. and does the laundry.

750
01:12:42.988 --> 01:12:45.991
and cooks the meals for the day.
and does the dishes for breakfast.

751
01:12:46.074 --> 01:12:48.368
And then we come in
from all of our surveys

752
01:12:48.452 --> 01:12:50.746
and then the next day it's my turn
with the kiddos.

753
01:12:50.829 --> 01:12:52.998
Like. you just stick one here
and hold two hands

754
01:12:53.081 --> 01:12:55.626
and if they fall. they fall.
you pick 'em back up again.

755
01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:56.710
Yeah.

756
01:12:56.793 --> 01:12:59.755
And then we just bump around again.
and now it's your turn to stay home.

757
01:13:00.714 --> 01:13:03.509
-Yes. That sounds amazing.
-Yeah.

758
01:13:03.592 --> 01:13:06.929
Are you thinking about
how exhausted you're gonna be?

759
01:13:08.472 --> 01:13:09.723
It's only one month.

760
01:13:09.806 --> 01:13:12.643
One month of working
for nine hours on the boat.

761
01:13:12.726 --> 01:13:15.187
coming home. not getting any sleep.

762
01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:19.942
I guess there just aren't that many
good examples of that in our field.

763
01:13:20.025 --> 01:13:21.443
We don't need any examples.

764
01:13:42.506 --> 01:13:45.092
Okay. Okay.

765
01:13:45.968 --> 01:13:46.969
Okay.

766
01:13:52.641 --> 01:13:54.935
-He told me this way.
-Got a singer?

767
01:13:55.018 --> 01:13:56.770
-Yeah?
-He's singing.

768
01:13:56.854 --> 01:13:58.438
-After when we go...
-Okay. Yeah.

769
01:13:58.522 --> 01:14:00.148
...and they stopped singing...

770
01:14:00.232 --> 01:14:02.901
-Okay. So we'll go-- Yeah.
-Yeah. okay.

771
01:14:02.985 --> 01:14:05.195
-'Cause last time he started again.
-Yeah. okay.

772
01:14:05.279 --> 01:14:08.240
Okay. I think-- Yeah.
That explains it. 'cause we heard--

773
01:14:08.323 --> 01:14:11.159
we heard pretty good songs.
so if he's off there. I-- Yeah.

774
01:14:12.035 --> 01:14:13.036
All right.

775
01:14:25.674 --> 01:14:26.800
Going in.

776
01:14:31.722 --> 01:14:33.974
I think we're going
in the right direction.

777
01:14:34.057 --> 01:14:35.309
I think he's louder.

778
01:14:41.106 --> 01:14:44.234
Yeah. we are definitely going
in the correct direction now.

779
01:14:44.318 --> 01:14:45.485
Yeah.

780
01:15:06.924 --> 01:15:08.008
Okay.

781
01:16:34.887 --> 01:16:37.723
This is the same song
we heard in Australia.

782
01:16:38.599 --> 01:16:41.518
The one we've been tracking all season.

783
01:16:44.396 --> 01:16:47.482
Which means there are
at least two different songs here.

784
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:55.073
A cultural crossroads.

785
01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:01.288
This whale is singing
the song from the west.

786
01:17:06.877 --> 01:17:09.505
But the other song has to be
from somewhere else.

787
01:17:17.179 --> 01:17:20.474
And the next closest population
is near Ecuador.

788
01:17:21.183 --> 01:17:23.143
5.000 miles east.

789
01:17:26.563 --> 01:17:31.652
What I thought was unprecedented
song sharing across the South Pacific

790
01:17:31.735 --> 01:17:35.989
could be just one piece
of a global cultural network.

791
01:17:41.453 --> 01:17:44.498
Thousands of brains learning and sharing

792
01:17:44.581 --> 01:17:48.085
some of the most complex acoustic patterns
on Earth.

793
01:17:56.176 --> 01:18:00.931
The result of evolution
that's millions of years older than ours.

794
01:18:07.145 --> 01:18:12.609
Studying whale culture might be more about
glimpsing something of ourselves.

795
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:19.825
How we can connect differently

796
01:18:21.368 --> 01:18:22.953
a million years from now.

797
01:20:14.356 --> 01:20:15.899
We're about to find out...

798
01:20:16.984 --> 01:20:18.193
if it worked on this one.

799
01:20:19.987 --> 01:20:21.488
That one starts there. Okay.

800
01:20:23.323 --> 01:20:25.951
So in the first before period.
there's one. two...

801
01:20:27.077 --> 01:20:28.328
three growls.

802
01:20:28.829 --> 01:20:29.830
No whups.

803
01:20:29.913 --> 01:20:33.417
In the second before period.
there's one. two. three whups.

804
01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.712
In the during period. there are one. two.

805
01:20:37.546 --> 01:20:41.925
three. four. five. six. seven...

806
01:20:43.302 --> 01:20:45.721
eight. nine. ten. eleven...

807
01:20:47.389 --> 01:20:48.724
twelve. thirteen.

808
01:20:51.435 --> 01:20:52.811
There are 13.

809
01:20:58.525 --> 01:21:00.986
-That's pretty cool. Right?
-That's pretty cool.

810
01:21:01.904 --> 01:21:03.280
They're talking back to you.

811
01:21:05.866 --> 01:21:07.576
I keep thinking it's not gonna work.

812
01:21:17.711 --> 01:21:20.589
I'm so pleased. I'm so pleased!

813
01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:33.602
It is so hard to interpret
the language of the natural world.

814
01:21:35.062 --> 01:21:40.359
To listen and to understand
what it's saying to itself.

815
01:21:43.028 --> 01:21:48.534
That is of the same proportion
as pointing all of our satellites skyward

816
01:21:48.617 --> 01:21:51.203
and listening for a sign from outer space.
