3
00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:47.129
This tree.

4
00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.590
it's one of the highest trees
in this neighborhood.

5
00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:52.719
This is the one eagles sit on top of.

6
00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:57.014
Look at this! Look at this!
Look how big it is.

7
00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:59.267
This is. this is ivy. babe.

8
00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.936
This is not the tree.

9
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.896
This is not the root.

10
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.107
This is a vine.

11
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.025
Right here.

12
00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:11.279
This tree has been alive
longer than Nana--

13
00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:13.948
- Me?
- Oh. definitely than you.

14
00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.325
Nana. Papa.

15
00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.121
Everyone you know.
and then their grandparents.

16
00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.290
I know George Washington.

17
00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:32.883
How does all the ivy stay strong

18
00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.719
if all the ivy is taking everything?

19
00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:37.471
- How do--
- It's gobbling everything up.

20
00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:39.181
All the nutrients. all the water.

21
00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.309
it's just gobbling it all up.

22
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.355
Ivy's killing everything
we love back here. Gil.

23
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.946
- Is it cut?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.741
That's it.
We did it.

25
00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.253
Straight back here.

26
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.926
Trees tell the truth.

27
00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:21.140
And they have stories to tell.

28
00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:27.814
About a man who plants a seed
during a time of darkness.

29
00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:32.401
A boy hidden in a forest.

30
00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.779
Another boy who falls in love.

31
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:39.825
A woman who makes trees immortal.

32
00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.830
We move through time.

33
00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.336
But trees stand still.

34
00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:52.713
Tall trees.

35
00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:55.216
Tiny trees.

36
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.302
Family trees.

37
00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:03.266
Like us. they are mighty.

38
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.396
They are vulnerable.

39
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.733
- Unlike us. they cannot escape.
- Woo-hoo!

40
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.947
To say my job is to make bonsai trees.

41
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.492
it's not enough for me.

42
00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.008
There's no reason to wanna be here

43
00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.718
doing this right now.
Right?

44
00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.429
Like. I didn't come here 'cause
I thought it was gonna be fun.

45
00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.475
I came here 'cause
I wanted to know.

46
00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:53.185
I wanna know what this is gonna become.

47
00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.859
The perception of bonsai is that

48
00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.402
we're recreating nature in miniature.

49
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.906
But the reality of bonsai is that

50
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.702
you have to understand
the physical environment.

51
00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.371
the influences that are acting on it.

52
00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.708
or else you can never get it right.

53
00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:20.379
I'm not in the game of defiling
a tree for my own...

54
00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.841
...curiosity.

55
00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.804
For these trees.
as far as they're concerned.

56
00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.181
I am the wind.

57
00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.391
I am the elevation.

58
00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.728
I am the temperature.

59
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.565
I am the intensity of the sun.

60
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.162
So all the branches move in this direction

61
00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:56.290
except for this one low piece over here.

62
00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:59.878
And you have this ridge.
and you have that angle.

63
00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.880
and all the deadwood is on that side.

64
00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:06.509
and all the living tissue's on this side.

65
00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.219
But nobody knows the actual story

66
00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.096
'cause it's 4.800 years old.

67
00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:15.852
Hm.

68
00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.688
This is intelligence on a level

69
00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:21.649
that we don't consider intelligence.

70
00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.323
Bristlecone pines.

71
00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:32.159
as the oldest living thing on earth.

72
00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:33.995
they're almost a religion.

73
00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:44.213
Somewhere along the evolution of mankind.

74
00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:47.926
there has been a constant
connection to the environment.

75
00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:54.891
And it has always been.
from my perspective.

76
00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:58.228
the tree as the connecting organism.

77
00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:02.773
We need them. we love them.
we appreciate them.

78
00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:05.610
and they form the fundamental
foundations of our memories.

79
00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.946
our culture. and our behavior.

80
00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.366
And we're so quick to forget them.

81
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:18.415
Humans have this narrative arc
over a hundred years.

82
00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.666
And trees have that kind of narrative arc

83
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.003
over thousands of years.

84
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:28.967
But. we deteriorate.
They get better with age.

85
00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.310
TV host 1: An heir to one of America's

86
00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:41.812
largest timber companies has died.

87
00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:45.816
George Weyerhaeuser Sr.
died over the weekend at 95.

88
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.069
He's seen here with
Ronald Reagan in the '80s.

89
00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:51.280
radio host 1: George Weyerhaeuser Sr.
was the fourth-generation CEO

90
00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.575
of the Seattle-based company
that bears his family's name.

91
00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:58.579
TV host 2: Like his father. grandfather.
and great-grandfather.

92
00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.247
George led Weyerhaeuser for decades.

93
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.668
radio host 2: He served as CEO
of Weyerhaeuser during the time

94
00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.753
the company started
a high-yield forestry model

95
00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:08.089
that greatly increased
the amount of logging.

96
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:19.141
radio host 3: A business legend.
and a wonderful human being.

97
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.060
Just a great guy.
George Weyerhaeuser.

98
00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:25.148
rest in peace. and thank you
for many years of service.

99
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.620
Okay. you've got two steps down here.

100
00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:42.498
Oh boy. That would be easy
to take a dive over.

101
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.208
It would be. yep.

102
00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:50.923
Now. they're gonna want you

103
00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.051
to sit in that chair right there. okay?

104
00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:58.931
Just put this here.

105
00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:05.980
So. do you recall having
someone put a camera on you?

106
00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:07.273
Put a what on?

107
00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:10.026
A camera on you. and.
and talk to you a little bit?

108
00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.664
When an independent historian sits down.

109
00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:27.501
not the company-paid historian.
10 or 15 years from now

110
00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.795
and writes the history of Weyerhaeuser.

111
00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:33.549
what would you hope they would
say about George Weyerhaeuser?

112
00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.302
What would you like to be remembered for?

113
00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.835
Each step of the way.

114
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.630
I'm not sure who was pullin'
what strings. ya know.

115
00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.382
To this day.
I can't tell you.

116
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:22.932
My impression is that much
of what later evolved

117
00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:27.187
in my company experience was accidental.

118
00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.654
When push came to shove
on what should you log.

119
00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.282
where and when.
and with what logging methods.

120
00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:42.702
supplying the mills was at
the top end of the scales.

121
00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:48.916
Regardless of season or whatever.

122
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.920
you were gonna get the logs out.

123
00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:57.508
There is more demand than there is supply.

124
00:11:57.592 --> 00:12:01.012
Everybody is doing everything
they can to run full out.

125
00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:04.307
and that's true almost worldwide.

126
00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:13.775
This timber is virgin timber.
and it was quite old.

127
00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:11.082
I've had an interesting life...

128
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.669
um. to say the least.

129
00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.841
I went through a celebrity part of my life

130
00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:24.095
where I was doing nothing
but being interviewed

131
00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.973
and asked about being kidnapped.

132
00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:34.647
I had no way of ascertaining their intent.

133
00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:24.530
There's so many different reasons

134
00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.991
why we do need old trees.

135
00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:29.243
They sequester carbon.

136
00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:34.624
They create a habitat
that younger trees cannot.

137
00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:39.170
And I just find that there's
such a unique beauty with age

138
00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.257
that I really appreciate.

139
00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:46.844
Yeah. When I look at my skin.

140
00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.554
I kind of try to feel that way. too.

141
00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:54.769
I-I'm trying to be happy
with that as well.

142
00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.624
I got excited when
I found this article

143
00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:19.502
in the newspaper from 2012.

144
00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:23.297
A kind of cryptic description

145
00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:27.177
of where the largest
remaining Joshua tree was.

146
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.639
Uh-oh.

147
00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.558
Wow. car just died.

148
00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.979
They don't want the location known.

149
00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:40.982
So. I figured if I could drive

150
00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:45.320
up and down these paths to scope the area.

151
00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:49.907
One by one. they've just gone.

152
00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:54.245
and this is the last largest tree.

153
00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.503
Maybe I can kind of look
right through here.

154
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.673
By the time I get there. you know.

155
00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:07.717
the excitement is palpable.

156
00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.011
This is looking promising up ahead.

157
00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:11.387
Well. there are tire tracks.

158
00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.140
and maybe down this way--
Oh. yeah. look at this!

159
00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:17.060
Unbelievable.

160
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.094
I think right here!

161
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.479
Okay.

162
00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:21.666
It's different looking through
that glass. isn't it?

163
00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:28.548
Mm...

164
00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.259
How lucky we are that we have

165
00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:35.305
such a completely barren landscape.

166
00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.600
All these small little nuances

167
00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:42.354
go into a tree portrait.

168
00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:47.858
So I think we should
probably take an exposure.

169
00:17:57.744 --> 00:18:01.789
I've got 10. uh. shots loaded.

170
00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:04.458
Not like with a digital.

171
00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:16.179
The sun sets again in the desert.

172
00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:19.391
Okay. that's it.
We're done.

173
00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:54.800
Don't trip on the ivy!

174
00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:15.405
Woo-hoo!

175
00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:22.787
Oh. my gosh.

176
00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:25.290
Come here.
You okay. babe?

177
00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.502
Hey. I'm sorry. babe.

178
00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.049
That was fun while it lasted. though.

179
00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:37.260
At least the tree's gonna live.

180
00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:57.071
Hi. this is Ally with the city of Portland

181
00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:59.908
Urban Forestry returning your call.

182
00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:03.452
I understand you had a tree
that fell into your yard.

183
00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.456
The responsibility for trees
in the right of way

184
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.418
would fall to you as the property owner.

185
00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:12.587
And if you have further questions.

186
00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:15.924
email trees@portlandoregon.
gov. Thank you.

187
00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:19.844
- Watch out--
- Oh. we are?

188
00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:21.262
Yeah. Move away. maybe?

189
00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:24.181
Oof!

190
00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.017
Okay!

191
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:28.520
It's coming. it's coming!

192
00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.858
It didn't break as much
as I thought it would.

193
00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:35.943
We can take it home.

194
00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:46.705
Wait.

195
00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:50.500
There's plenty more where this came from!

196
00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:01.511
Where do I have to walk it to?

197
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.321
When I was growing up.

198
00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:23.991
my father felt like a giant to me.

199
00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:28.829
He was very tall.

200
00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:31.833
and I was constantly looking up at him.

201
00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:36.796
But he was also my dad.

202
00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.593
And now. he's about to die.

203
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.850
I think my children felt
Papa would live forever.

204
00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:03.531
When I look out at this forest
surrounding my house.

205
00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:04.866
I...

206
00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:08.160
I just think about decay.

207
00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:10.037
I think about my dad.

208
00:22:15.502 --> 00:22:17.044
The doctors told me

209
00:22:17.128 --> 00:22:19.797
that Alzheimer's is really just

210
00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:22.634
all these tangled-up neurons in the brain.

211
00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:29.557
He can't remember anymore
that he was a photographer.

212
00:22:29.641 --> 00:22:31.976
He's the one who taught me to make movies.

213
00:22:32.811 --> 00:22:35.313
He can't remember that he was a teacher.

214
00:22:35.397 --> 00:22:36.648
an inventor.

215
00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:42.486
You know. they say
when you have this disease

216
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.197
that the memories you hold on
to the longest

217
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:47.325
are the first-formed memories.

218
00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:53.790
He knew my mom since he was a little boy.

219
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:59.713
And so. I believe my mom
will be my dad's last memory.

220
00:23:06.678 --> 00:23:09.305
When I look out at the trees
in my backyard.

221
00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:12.725
I think about the loss
that I know is coming.

222
00:23:30.285 --> 00:23:34.246
There's no difference between
a big tree and a small tree.

223
00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:39.877
They both have roots.
They both have leaves.

224
00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:43.048
They both need water.
They both need sun.

225
00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:52.557
Bonsai literally means "tree in tray."

226
00:23:53.725 --> 00:23:57.020
"Bon" means tray. "sai" means tree.

227
00:23:57.562 --> 00:24:01.816
And the kanji symbols together
make the term bonsai.

228
00:24:13.495 --> 00:24:15.162
These trees look this way

229
00:24:15.246 --> 00:24:18.917
because they're not living
in the Hilton of the landscape.

230
00:24:25.048 --> 00:24:28.092
For all of the attention
that everybody puts into

231
00:24:28.176 --> 00:24:29.510
the wiring and the bending

232
00:24:29.594 --> 00:24:31.804
and the pruning and the styling.

233
00:24:31.888 --> 00:24:35.349
the place that matters for bonsai

234
00:24:35.433 --> 00:24:37.727
is the core of the root mass.

235
00:24:39.145 --> 00:24:42.857
And when you confine it.
that bonsai container

236
00:24:42.941 --> 00:24:45.777
is the last place
that a root wants to grow.

237
00:24:48.738 --> 00:24:51.616
Imagine starving your entire life.

238
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.494
That's why they're so small.

239
00:25:05.922 --> 00:25:08.174
Each time I choose to touch a tree

240
00:25:08.258 --> 00:25:09.968
when I fall out of love with it.

241
00:25:10.593 --> 00:25:12.345
I work it until
I'm back in love.

242
00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:15.097
And then I let it do what it's gonna do

243
00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:17.016
until I fall out of love again.

244
00:25:18.768 --> 00:25:21.520
So it's like a constant
breakup-make-out-session kinda.

245
00:25:21.604 --> 00:25:23.940
You know. back and forth.

246
00:25:27.736 --> 00:25:29.779
'Cause at some point.

247
00:25:29.863 --> 00:25:32.073
this kind of softness is what I want.

248
00:25:32.157 --> 00:25:33.908
but it's not there yet.

249
00:25:33.992 --> 00:25:36.911
We still have more time.
Gotta work a little harder.

250
00:25:40.331 --> 00:25:42.500
My life since I was young

251
00:25:42.584 --> 00:25:44.418
has been dedicated to this thing

252
00:25:44.502 --> 00:25:45.753
that I didn't really understand

253
00:25:45.837 --> 00:25:47.588
why I was compelled to be a part of it.

254
00:25:47.672 --> 00:25:49.382
You know. like I still--
People say.

255
00:25:49.466 --> 00:25:51.842
"Well. were your parents
into gardening or...?"

256
00:25:51.926 --> 00:25:55.388
There was no association whatsoever at all

257
00:25:55.472 --> 00:25:56.973
to anything related to bonsai

258
00:25:57.057 --> 00:25:59.392
ever in my life prior to that moment.

259
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:01.185
It just happened.

260
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:04.438
It was immaculate conception.
and I thought. "That's cool.

261
00:26:04.522 --> 00:26:06.107
I'm gonna do that."

262
00:26:06.191 --> 00:26:08.192
And not only am I gonna do it.
like. go buy one.

263
00:26:08.276 --> 00:26:10.778
and water it and see if I can.
you know. keep it alive.

264
00:26:10.862 --> 00:26:12.405
I'm gonna do it for the rest of my life.

265
00:26:12.489 --> 00:26:14.699
Alright. we're on the rooftop

266
00:26:14.783 --> 00:26:16.575
of the workshop. and. uh.

267
00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:17.952
here's a look at my world.

268
00:26:19.037 --> 00:26:22.456
I was 21 when I went to Japan.

269
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.833
I told him
I wanted to study with him.

270
00:26:23.917 --> 00:26:26.294
and he said.
"Well. it's gonna be difficult

271
00:26:26.378 --> 00:26:28.754
for a foreigner to come over
here and study with me."

272
00:26:28.838 --> 00:26:30.881
So. um. I ended up writing him a letter

273
00:26:30.965 --> 00:26:33.050
every month for about two years.

274
00:26:33.134 --> 00:26:35.845
asking him if I could study with him.

275
00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.140
So I wrote him 23 letters.

276
00:26:41.976 --> 00:26:44.937
He wrote me back.
The gist is. "You can come.

277
00:26:45.021 --> 00:26:48.316
but don't plan on staying.
Stop writing letters."

278
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.944
That was the gist.

279
00:26:51.778 --> 00:26:54.322
To be an apprentice.
people have this romantic idea.

280
00:26:54.406 --> 00:26:56.741
You know. they think about
the Karate Kid and Mr. Miyagi

281
00:26:56.825 --> 00:26:59.243
and. like. "wax on. wax off."
and he's gonna be strict.

282
00:26:59.327 --> 00:27:00.494
but really. he likes you.

283
00:27:00.578 --> 00:27:01.746
You know. that's not what it's like.

284
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.497
At least it's not what
it's like for Mr. Kimura.

285
00:27:03.581 --> 00:27:06.459
Think only tree.

286
00:27:07.002 --> 00:27:11.130
During that first meeting.
he made one statement.

287
00:27:11.214 --> 00:27:12.673
"Apprentices are like dogs.

288
00:27:12.757 --> 00:27:14.508
"It doesn't matter where you eat.

289
00:27:14.592 --> 00:27:15.635
"or where you sleep.

290
00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:17.011
"or whether you get kicked or not.

291
00:27:17.095 --> 00:27:20.181
It's just a matter of whether
you show up the next day."

292
00:27:20.849 --> 00:27:23.100
Yeah. I'm here every day.
We don't get--

293
00:27:23.184 --> 00:27:26.687
We get maybe one day off
a month. maybe two.

294
00:27:26.771 --> 00:27:30.483
So... I-I don't really have any place to go.

295
00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:33.319
Trees. trees. everywhere.

296
00:27:33.403 --> 00:27:34.362
It was brutal.

297
00:27:34.446 --> 00:27:35.696
The first three months.

298
00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.573
he was trying to get me
to quit the entire time.

299
00:27:37.657 --> 00:27:40.368
It was just a three-month hazing.

300
00:27:40.452 --> 00:27:43.788
It sucked.
It was terrible.

301
00:27:43.872 --> 00:27:46.582
So much of my apprenticeship.

302
00:27:46.666 --> 00:27:49.835
getting really aggressively reprimanded

303
00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:52.004
for things that I never did.

304
00:27:52.088 --> 00:27:55.424
Not many people are willing
to be that nasty.

305
00:27:56.718 --> 00:27:58.636
For him. there's this antiquated notion

306
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.846
of how you build a stronger person.

307
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:04.100
a stronger heart. a-a more durable man.

308
00:28:07.604 --> 00:28:10.148
But he did cultivate greatness.

309
00:28:14.152 --> 00:28:17.072
Probably. it's the best tree
I've ever seen in my life.

310
00:28:20.325 --> 00:28:24.245
For six years. the dialogue about me was.

311
00:28:24.329 --> 00:28:26.622
"A gaijin will never understand bonsai.

312
00:28:26.706 --> 00:28:27.999
"It's impossible.

313
00:28:28.083 --> 00:28:30.960
You don't have it.
This is a Japanese art form."

314
00:28:31.044 --> 00:28:32.712
Clients of Mr. Kimura would request

315
00:28:32.796 --> 00:28:35.215
I not be able to work on their trees.

316
00:28:35.715 --> 00:28:37.842
But with Mr. Kimura. it mattered to me

317
00:28:37.926 --> 00:28:39.343
because he was my master.

318
00:28:39.427 --> 00:28:42.222
I sweat. I bled. I cried.

319
00:28:43.598 --> 00:28:46.142
I went through a lot with that guy.

320
00:28:46.226 --> 00:28:48.227
And towards the end of my apprenticeship.

321
00:28:48.311 --> 00:28:49.729
I had become accepted.

322
00:28:49.813 --> 00:28:51.105
I was a part of the family.

323
00:28:51.189 --> 00:28:54.442
I was doing all of the work in the garden.

324
00:28:55.527 --> 00:28:57.403
When I went back three months later.

325
00:28:57.487 --> 00:28:58.863
I was a foreigner again.

326
00:28:58.947 --> 00:29:01.657
And that really broke my heart.

327
00:29:11.876 --> 00:29:14.587
You asked a question.
I probably didn't answer.

328
00:29:19.884 --> 00:29:23.179
Did you ever see trees as art?

329
00:29:25.849 --> 00:29:29.393
I wouldn't say so. No.

330
00:29:36.735 --> 00:29:39.404
You're thinking about bonsai?

331
00:29:43.658 --> 00:29:45.284
I don't know how many individuals

332
00:29:45.368 --> 00:29:47.161
are interested in bonsai.

333
00:29:47.245 --> 00:29:50.790
but I got there accidentally.

334
00:29:51.875 --> 00:29:55.003
It's a big part of
Weyerhaeuser history.

335
00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.172
What we eventually did do

336
00:29:58.256 --> 00:30:00.842
turned out to be pretty significant.

337
00:30:02.761 --> 00:30:04.428
Time may be running out.

338
00:30:04.512 --> 00:30:07.640
Two bonsai trees stolen
from a museum in Federal Way...

339
00:30:07.724 --> 00:30:10.184
The thieves got in by kicking in a gate

340
00:30:10.268 --> 00:30:13.104
up the road here at
the Pacific Bonsai Museum.

341
00:30:13.188 --> 00:30:15.356
Once inside. they stole two trees

342
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.024
worth thousands of dollars.

343
00:30:17.108 --> 00:30:18.526
Assistant curator
Scarlet Gore

344
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.572
walked onto the grounds to
find the display cases empty.

345
00:30:34.417 --> 00:30:36.544
We're on the east entrance

346
00:30:36.628 --> 00:30:40.048
of Weyerhaeuser Company's
headquarters campus.

347
00:30:41.966 --> 00:30:45.094
You go around the campus and the museum.

348
00:30:45.178 --> 00:30:47.722
we're amongst all these trees.
kinda hidden.

349
00:30:50.433 --> 00:30:52.977
These trees are like my children.

350
00:30:53.478 --> 00:30:55.896
They took somethin' from me. personally.

351
00:30:59.317 --> 00:31:02.278
I got the phone call
from our monitoring service.

352
00:31:03.113 --> 00:31:05.239
Got here as fast as I could.

353
00:31:08.493 --> 00:31:10.703
I rounded the corner.

354
00:31:10.787 --> 00:31:15.166
and that's when I saw that
the black pine was taken.

355
00:31:18.253 --> 00:31:20.338
reporter 1:
The tree you don't see here.

356
00:31:20.422 --> 00:31:22.548
the biggest gut punch of this theft.

357
00:31:23.967 --> 00:31:26.594
You may see branches.
but the man who grew this

358
00:31:26.678 --> 00:31:29.848
created beauty as
an ugly history played out.

359
00:31:30.348 --> 00:31:33.017
Museum officials say
they just want the trees back.

360
00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:35.519
They're asking anyone
with any information about them

361
00:31:35.603 --> 00:31:37.772
to either return them
or contact the museum.

362
00:31:37.856 --> 00:31:40.107
reporter 2: As of today.
there are no leads on the whereabouts

363
00:31:40.191 --> 00:31:42.568
of the two trees.
which could die within days

364
00:31:42.652 --> 00:31:45.321
without the meticulous care
they're used to.

365
00:31:58.084 --> 00:31:59.794
"Hello. I just saw an article

366
00:31:59.878 --> 00:32:02.004
"that a bonsai tree was stolen.

367
00:32:02.088 --> 00:32:05.049
"The bonsai tree was grown
by my grandfather.

368
00:32:05.133 --> 00:32:08.928
"Juzaburo Furuzawa. whom I am named after.

369
00:32:09.012 --> 00:32:11.931
"My family had no idea this tree existed.

370
00:32:12.015 --> 00:32:14.517
"Thank you for taking care of this tree.

371
00:32:14.601 --> 00:32:16.686
Matthew Furuzawa."

372
00:32:23.234 --> 00:32:26.488
My father was a great bonsai master.

373
00:32:31.868 --> 00:32:33.828
Before the war. the Furuzawa brothers.

374
00:32:33.912 --> 00:32:36.914
the three brothers. they owned a nursery

375
00:32:36.998 --> 00:32:39.459
in Berkeley on
San Pablo Avenue.

376
00:32:40.001 --> 00:32:42.087
So we all lived together.

377
00:32:43.672 --> 00:32:45.173
I think that's me.

378
00:32:46.424 --> 00:32:47.967
Little me.

379
00:32:49.052 --> 00:32:51.262
Once. uh. the war broke out.

380
00:32:51.346 --> 00:32:53.598
then they had to give all that up.

381
00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:01.439
You could only take to camp
what you could carry.

382
00:33:04.776 --> 00:33:09.363
And so. my parents had
a garage sale out in front.

383
00:33:09.447 --> 00:33:13.367
The people that were coming knew
that they were going to camp.

384
00:33:13.451 --> 00:33:15.411
and they had to get rid of this stuff.

385
00:33:15.495 --> 00:33:19.332
and so. they were trying to make the price

386
00:33:19.416 --> 00:33:20.541
lower and lower.

387
00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:23.586
And that's the only time
my mother was angry.

388
00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.464
She had these beautiful
Japanese dishes and stuff

389
00:33:26.548 --> 00:33:29.342
that she was going to sell.
and the people would come.

390
00:33:29.426 --> 00:33:31.510
and they would try to get it
cheaper and cheaper.

391
00:33:31.594 --> 00:33:34.472
and she got so angry. she just broke them.

392
00:33:38.143 --> 00:33:39.936
It's called "Internment Camp."

393
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.605
but it was really a concentration camp.

394
00:33:56.828 --> 00:33:59.455
They were sent to Tulelake.
which became famous

395
00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:02.375
because of all the dissent
that went on there.

396
00:34:02.459 --> 00:34:05.628
They were deemed troublemakers.

397
00:34:09.341 --> 00:34:11.759
He probably had the seeds stored away

398
00:34:11.843 --> 00:34:13.886
somewhere in his suitcase.

399
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:16.598
The seeds came from Japan.

400
00:34:19.476 --> 00:34:22.478
And he started to grow them in camp.

401
00:34:22.562 --> 00:34:24.856
in a tin can. probably a soup can.

402
00:34:27.692 --> 00:34:30.111
You have to remember that. before the war.

403
00:34:30.195 --> 00:34:32.488
my parents had a nursery.

404
00:34:32.572 --> 00:34:33.906
To go from that

405
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:37.118
to where there's nothing.

406
00:34:37.202 --> 00:34:39.912
it was not a very pretty picture up there.

407
00:34:48.254 --> 00:34:50.214
But one of the seeds took.

408
00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:08.524
I think that bonsai. for him.

409
00:35:08.608 --> 00:35:10.902
you know. was probably therapeutic.

410
00:35:13.863 --> 00:35:17.992
He's in camp. but when he's.
you know. tending to his tree.

411
00:35:18.076 --> 00:35:19.994
maybe it takes him away.

412
00:35:20.078 --> 00:35:23.581
For a few hours. he can have
his mind take him elsewhere.

413
00:35:26.543 --> 00:35:29.503
If I can. you know.
maybe bring life to this tree

414
00:35:29.587 --> 00:35:33.591
and then have hope.
maybe one day. we'll get out.

415
00:35:35.969 --> 00:35:38.512
We all need that sometimes.
just to get away from.

416
00:35:38.596 --> 00:35:41.807
you know. the world and all the craziness

417
00:35:41.891 --> 00:35:43.309
and just. you know. be grateful

418
00:35:43.393 --> 00:35:44.936
for the. the little things that we have.

419
00:35:51.067 --> 00:35:53.235
It was a really hard life.

420
00:35:53.319 --> 00:35:55.696
All of them.
Everybody who went to camp.

421
00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.657
I give them a lot of credit.

422
00:36:20.263 --> 00:36:22.431
If you look at those little bonsai plants.

423
00:36:22.515 --> 00:36:25.602
you get pleasure from just seeing it.

424
00:36:28.146 --> 00:36:30.147
But it's more than that.

425
00:36:33.318 --> 00:36:35.320
They endured.

426
00:36:48.917 --> 00:36:53.045
We came back. and they had
everything taken away from them.

427
00:36:53.129 --> 00:36:54.964
They lost their businesses and everything.

428
00:36:58.677 --> 00:37:00.261
They had to start from scratch.

429
00:37:00.345 --> 00:37:02.930
So my father and his two brothers.

430
00:37:03.014 --> 00:37:05.517
they all became gardeners.

431
00:37:07.352 --> 00:37:09.646
He worked six days a week.

432
00:37:12.524 --> 00:37:15.610
When he would come back from gardening

433
00:37:15.694 --> 00:37:19.239
in the evening. at twilight.

434
00:37:20.782 --> 00:37:23.868
you could find him sometimes
just sitting in the backyard.

435
00:37:23.952 --> 00:37:26.412
just looking at his trees.

436
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:36.172
After his death.

437
00:37:36.256 --> 00:37:39.801
the plants were just too much
for my mother to take care of.

438
00:37:41.386 --> 00:37:44.848
And so. we decided
that we would sell the plants.

439
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.601
I mean. the museum.

440
00:37:48.685 --> 00:37:51.270
I didn't know anything about it.

441
00:37:51.354 --> 00:37:54.357
I would have never known. unless.

442
00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:57.401
of all things. unless it was stolen.

443
00:38:12.542 --> 00:38:15.253
I never had any confusion
that I wasn't Japanese.

444
00:38:15.837 --> 00:38:19.215
But I recognize that
that was not my place.

445
00:38:19.299 --> 00:38:20.633
That that was not my place.

446
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.346
To Mr. Kimura treating me
like a foreigner again.

447
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.806
after having gone through
what I went through

448
00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:29.600
over six years with him
and that community of people.

449
00:38:29.684 --> 00:38:31.477
best thing that could have happened to me?

450
00:38:31.561 --> 00:38:33.355
Best thing that could have happened to me.

451
00:38:35.273 --> 00:38:37.275
I built this place

452
00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:39.652
in a state of total defiance.

453
00:38:44.657 --> 00:38:47.702
Because I recognized
I'm not like them.

454
00:38:48.661 --> 00:38:50.789
I'm never gonna be like them.

455
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.127
And. in fact. I need
to go find my own way.

456
00:38:56.211 --> 00:38:59.130
- camera operator: Rolling.
- What's going on. everybody?

457
00:38:59.214 --> 00:39:01.966
I wish. I do wish

458
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:03.384
that I was in house tonight.

459
00:39:03.468 --> 00:39:06.304
but Super Tuesday from afar...

460
00:39:06.388 --> 00:39:08.055
If we're talking deciduous.

461
00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:11.475
we're probably at the tail end
of that leaf color change.

462
00:39:11.559 --> 00:39:12.727
leaves shriveling up...

463
00:39:12.811 --> 00:39:15.730
I couldn't do things the Japanese way.

464
00:39:15.814 --> 00:39:17.023
There wasn't an American way.

465
00:39:17.107 --> 00:39:18.899
I could separate this piece...

466
00:39:18.983 --> 00:39:21.652
And that became the goal.

467
00:39:21.736 --> 00:39:23.946
was developing an identity.
not just for me.

468
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:28.159
but an identity for this art
form in the United States

469
00:39:28.243 --> 00:39:30.202
that deviated from the Japanese model.

470
00:39:30.286 --> 00:39:31.829
Up next is Stephan.

471
00:39:31.913 --> 00:39:34.248
Stephan says. "Hi.
I'm in Zurich. Switzerland."

472
00:39:34.332 --> 00:39:35.750
He has a design
and technique question today.

473
00:39:35.834 --> 00:39:38.836
This is where we would
wedge cut the underside of this

474
00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.839
to generate that next flush
of foliar mass--

475
00:39:41.923 --> 00:39:45.343
- Hey. bud.
- Dad. there's a hazard sign on my computer.

476
00:39:45.427 --> 00:39:46.677
- A hazard sign?
- Yeah.

477
00:39:46.761 --> 00:39:49.597
Okay. Okay. Hey. T?
This is the last time

478
00:39:49.681 --> 00:39:51.766
that I'm gonna be able
to help you out. bud.

479
00:39:53.643 --> 00:39:55.186
T? Taft?

480
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.354
- Yeah?
- You good?

481
00:39:56.438 --> 00:39:58.023
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

482
00:40:10.452 --> 00:40:13.704
So. my son and I live around here.

483
00:40:13.788 --> 00:40:16.916
It's pretty rural and secluded.

484
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.918
Recently. we became aware

485
00:40:19.002 --> 00:40:22.005
that a lot of the property
up here is Weyerhaeuser.

486
00:40:22.881 --> 00:40:25.383
Till they put up the signs.
I really had no idea.

487
00:40:25.467 --> 00:40:27.427
I had no idea at all.

488
00:40:28.595 --> 00:40:30.680
This sign just popped up.

489
00:40:31.389 --> 00:40:33.975
I don't know. maybe six months ago.

490
00:40:34.809 --> 00:40:38.271
It's such a massive landowner
in the Pacific Northwest.

491
00:40:38.855 --> 00:40:42.525
It's always weird when
you think that you're in

492
00:40:42.609 --> 00:40:46.279
a rural. sort of isolated
farming community.

493
00:40:46.363 --> 00:40:49.323
and then you realize that Big Corporation

494
00:40:49.407 --> 00:40:53.327
has sort of a stronghold
on the land around you.

495
00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:54.996
It-It's actually. I would say.

496
00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:58.082
a little unsettling. uh.
to be totally honest.

497
00:41:15.767 --> 00:41:17.852
Coming back from Japan.
I worked at

498
00:41:17.936 --> 00:41:21.522
the Weyerhaeuser Pacific Rim
Bonsai Collection a lot.

499
00:41:21.606 --> 00:41:23.441
And through the relationship I had with

500
00:41:23.525 --> 00:41:25.109
the Weyerhaeuser collection.

501
00:41:25.193 --> 00:41:28.029
I learned more about the expansive empire

502
00:41:28.113 --> 00:41:30.949
that Weyerhaeuser had
created through timber.

503
00:41:34.452 --> 00:41:36.912
He had a shipping line for boats.

504
00:41:36.996 --> 00:41:39.415
he had freight lines within North America

505
00:41:39.499 --> 00:41:41.876
to transport the logs. he had mills.

506
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.255
They were in control of
literally every piece of it.

507
00:41:50.468 --> 00:41:52.887
There was this tension in seeing

508
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:56.223
this bonsai collection at a corporation

509
00:41:56.307 --> 00:41:58.434
that was clear cutting

510
00:41:58.518 --> 00:42:00.812
a tremendous amount of forest.

511
00:42:27.922 --> 00:42:31.842
Our family has been
all wrapped up in trees

512
00:42:31.926 --> 00:42:36.181
in all different forms.
back to my great-grandfather.

513
00:42:41.853 --> 00:42:45.106
And all the way down to me. personally.

514
00:42:52.655 --> 00:42:54.782
radio host 1: George Weyerhaeuser
was snatched

515
00:42:54.866 --> 00:42:57.785
off the streets of Tacoma

516
00:42:57.869 --> 00:43:01.247
- in 1935.
- radio host 2: In the 1930s?

517
00:43:01.331 --> 00:43:03.833
- radio host 1: In the 1930s.
- radio host 2: Wow.

518
00:43:10.048 --> 00:43:14.010
radio host 1: It had turned out
that his grandfather's obituary

519
00:43:14.594 --> 00:43:18.890
caught the attention of three people.

520
00:43:20.225 --> 00:43:23.019
And they had the idea
to have him kidnapped.

521
00:43:51.256 --> 00:43:54.884
No! No! No! Ah! No!

522
00:44:49.981 --> 00:44:51.774
What you don't know when you're kidnapped

523
00:44:51.858 --> 00:44:53.943
is you don't know the end.

524
00:44:54.027 --> 00:44:57.029
You don't necessarily wanna know the end.

525
00:44:57.113 --> 00:44:58.281
newsreel reporter:
Vicious kidnapping.

526
00:44:58.365 --> 00:45:00.533
George Philip Weyerhaeuser. 9 years old.

527
00:45:00.617 --> 00:45:02.618
disappears in
Tacoma. Washington.

528
00:45:02.702 --> 00:45:04.328
His mother. grief-stricken.

529
00:45:04.412 --> 00:45:06.914
and his father.
multimillionaire-lumberman.

530
00:45:06.998 --> 00:45:08.583
are pushing the search.

531
00:45:08.667 --> 00:45:10.585
The help of every citizen is needed.

532
00:45:10.669 --> 00:45:12.670
If you see a boy of this description.

533
00:45:12.754 --> 00:45:14.797
tell your police
or the Department of Justice

534
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:16.800
at Washington DC.

535
00:45:48.206 --> 00:45:51.459
I was trying to think.
You know. what am I gonna do?

536
00:45:52.043 --> 00:45:54.921
Then. they took me out
in the woods and left me.

537
00:45:55.005 --> 00:45:58.299
chained. in a hole in the ground.

538
00:46:42.052 --> 00:46:45.221
In the end. I was by myself.

539
00:46:45.305 --> 00:46:48.433
Remote. Left alone.

540
00:48:34.748 --> 00:48:36.207
newsreel reporter:
Home again.

541
00:48:36.291 --> 00:48:38.125
Tacoma's 9-year-old
George Weyerhaeuser.

542
00:48:38.209 --> 00:48:40.169
released by kidnappers after eight days.

543
00:48:40.253 --> 00:48:41.837
aids the hunt for his captors.

544
00:48:43.173 --> 00:48:44.757
The Weyerhaeuser home.

545
00:48:44.841 --> 00:48:46.175
Here. the frantic parents waited

546
00:48:46.259 --> 00:48:48.845
after paying $200.000 to the bandits.

547
00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.889
The farmhouse to which
the boy walked six miles

548
00:48:51.973 --> 00:48:53.474
and told his story of capture.

549
00:48:53.558 --> 00:48:55.101
imprisonment in chains.

550
00:48:55.185 --> 00:48:57.812
and of riding about
boxed in an auto trunk.

551
00:48:57.896 --> 00:48:59.272
The boy's safety brings cheer

552
00:48:59.356 --> 00:49:00.940
to thousands of other anxious parents

553
00:49:01.024 --> 00:49:03.609
as the manhunt goes on.

554
00:49:06.613 --> 00:49:09.782
I think I learned being camera-shy

555
00:49:09.866 --> 00:49:11.785
as a 9-year-old.

556
00:49:12.285 --> 00:49:15.454
There I was. in our backyard
full of reporters

557
00:49:15.538 --> 00:49:19.500
and newspaper people
and curiosity-seekers.

558
00:49:22.462 --> 00:49:25.339
I wouldn't know that that was
very entertaining for me.

559
00:49:25.423 --> 00:49:28.217
but. uh.
I couldn't get rid of it.

560
00:50:21.646 --> 00:50:23.105
Timber.

561
00:50:23.189 --> 00:50:25.567
It's always been a big thing in my life.

562
00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.029
And. uh. I don't know
whether it didn't lead

563
00:50:30.113 --> 00:50:31.823
to my kidnapping. too.

564
00:50:33.158 --> 00:50:34.367
Probably did.

565
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:03.855
Battle to the death!

566
00:51:10.862 --> 00:51:12.905
Basically. my dad.

567
00:51:12.989 --> 00:51:15.908
he has all these bonsais
to keep him company.

568
00:51:15.992 --> 00:51:18.661
This one. this one's a good battleground

569
00:51:18.745 --> 00:51:22.832
'cause it has like big distance
and lots of trees.

570
00:51:22.916 --> 00:51:25.251
This would be a good climbing ground.

571
00:51:25.335 --> 00:51:27.587
Like. see who's the fastest.

572
00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:31.799
But it's not a battleground.
No sir-ee-do.

573
00:51:31.883 --> 00:51:33.509
Hold on. we gotta find my tree.

574
00:51:33.593 --> 00:51:37.471
Stay out here for a second.
Dad. where's my tree?

575
00:51:37.555 --> 00:51:39.181
- Huh?
- Where's my tree?

576
00:51:39.265 --> 00:51:41.559
I know right where it is.

577
00:51:42.894 --> 00:51:45.104
I couldn't see.

578
00:51:45.188 --> 00:51:46.480
This is my tree!

579
00:51:46.564 --> 00:51:50.526
I got it from when
it was like a tiny baby.

580
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:53.154
I pruned it. I wired it.

581
00:51:53.238 --> 00:51:56.824
I made it like a boxer
to scare the bugs away.

582
00:51:56.908 --> 00:52:01.246
It's basically mine. so yeah...

583
00:52:02.205 --> 00:52:03.873
Let's wrap this up.

584
00:52:08.753 --> 00:52:11.505
People say. "Is there a tree
that you would take

585
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:14.884
if you could only take one tree?"

586
00:52:14.968 --> 00:52:17.846
This is a tree that I don't
fall out of love with.

587
00:52:21.266 --> 00:52:22.934
This is Baker.

588
00:52:23.393 --> 00:52:25.353
Baker and I have
a very long history together.

589
00:52:25.437 --> 00:52:28.314
This is the first
Rocky Mountain Juniper

590
00:52:28.398 --> 00:52:30.358
that I ever did any work on.

591
00:52:30.775 --> 00:52:33.736
I think this little section right here

592
00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.489
is just... incredible.

593
00:52:37.032 --> 00:52:40.118
It's like a confluence of currents.

594
00:52:40.869 --> 00:52:43.204
The dead and the live
and where they're all twisting

595
00:52:43.288 --> 00:52:46.541
and moving and rotating around each other.

596
00:52:48.126 --> 00:52:49.794
Mesmerizing.

597
00:52:53.798 --> 00:52:56.133
It's like you know what
these trees really look like

598
00:52:56.217 --> 00:52:58.552
- with their clothes off.
- Yeah.

599
00:52:58.636 --> 00:53:01.138
Yeah. Yeah. I know
what they look like naked.

600
00:53:01.222 --> 00:53:04.893
Well. because I've been
so intimate with them.

601
00:53:06.186 --> 00:53:07.645
Uh...

602
00:53:09.064 --> 00:53:12.650
Yeah. I've been super intimate with them.

603
00:53:14.027 --> 00:53:16.570
I mean... Boy. with Baker.

604
00:53:18.156 --> 00:53:19.907
It's had roots grafted to it.

605
00:53:19.991 --> 00:53:22.994
It's had roots ripped off of it.

606
00:53:23.078 --> 00:53:24.912
It's had all of its root system bent

607
00:53:24.996 --> 00:53:27.039
and highly manipulated.

608
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.586
My technique was. like. super raw.

609
00:53:36.841 --> 00:53:39.010
This tree has really--

610
00:53:39.094 --> 00:53:41.763
It's really been through a lot. Yeah.

611
00:53:45.266 --> 00:53:48.978
This tree really birthed
the more wild aesthetic

612
00:53:49.062 --> 00:53:50.980
and spirit of my work.

613
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:58.571
This little hiccup right here--
shhp--

614
00:53:58.655 --> 00:54:01.282
where the live vein. and you see the wood

615
00:54:01.366 --> 00:54:03.117
and everything just sort of move through

616
00:54:03.201 --> 00:54:05.787
that portion of the tree is fantastic.

617
00:54:06.621 --> 00:54:09.833
I saw this tree right after
it had been collected.

618
00:54:10.333 --> 00:54:12.627
Um. and it was like love at first sight.

619
00:54:38.695 --> 00:54:39.987
What sayeth the woman

620
00:54:40.071 --> 00:54:43.115
who lies in green pastures
that are not her own?

621
00:54:46.036 --> 00:54:48.204
What songs does she sing?

622
00:54:52.751 --> 00:54:54.335
What sound do her fingers make

623
00:54:54.419 --> 00:54:57.088
as she tends the garden
of some other dream?

624
00:55:01.426 --> 00:55:04.011
What sayeth the woman
who lies in green pastures

625
00:55:04.095 --> 00:55:05.764
that are not her own?

626
00:55:18.193 --> 00:55:20.445
This was the ship.

627
00:55:22.447 --> 00:55:25.032
My brothers and I would
pretend that this was a ship.

628
00:55:25.116 --> 00:55:26.701
and one of us would come out here.

629
00:55:26.785 --> 00:55:30.079
and we'd hide a stuffed animal
and then we had to--

630
00:55:30.163 --> 00:55:32.123
The driveway was the Piranha river.

631
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.795
So we had to take the ship
and cross the Piranha river.

632
00:55:37.879 --> 00:55:40.340
and one of us would have
to find the stuffed animal.

633
00:55:41.216 --> 00:55:43.175
It was kinda fun.

634
00:55:45.053 --> 00:55:46.554
It's been 18 years.

635
00:55:46.638 --> 00:55:48.389
But. even when I'm here now.

636
00:55:48.473 --> 00:55:50.975
I can see what's missing.

637
00:56:00.443 --> 00:56:02.570
So if I say "nature."

638
00:56:03.446 --> 00:56:05.699
what comes to mind?

639
00:56:06.491 --> 00:56:08.618
Who comes to mind?

640
00:56:10.245 --> 00:56:12.371
If I say "nature."

641
00:56:12.455 --> 00:56:14.708
do you come to mind?

642
00:56:16.376 --> 00:56:18.878
If I answer that question.
for a really long time.

643
00:56:18.962 --> 00:56:20.547
I did not come to mind.

644
00:56:21.715 --> 00:56:24.467
One of the drivers
behind all the work I do is.

645
00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:26.177
you know. where do I belong?

646
00:56:31.474 --> 00:56:34.268
I grew up in Mamaroneck.
New York.

647
00:56:37.188 --> 00:56:38.439
And my father took this job.

648
00:56:38.523 --> 00:56:40.483
It was a very wealthy family

649
00:56:40.567 --> 00:56:41.817
that owned this 12-acre estate

650
00:56:41.901 --> 00:56:43.319
right outside of New York City.

651
00:56:43.403 --> 00:56:45.696
and they needed full-time caretakers.

652
00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:49.617
This was 1958. so if you are
a caretaker for an estate.

653
00:56:49.701 --> 00:56:51.036
you're gonna live on it.

654
00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:58.292
It had a-a pond.
There was a swimming pool.

655
00:56:58.376 --> 00:57:00.211
There was a huge. beautiful house.

656
00:57:00.295 --> 00:57:01.963
which is where the owners would live

657
00:57:02.047 --> 00:57:02.797
when they were there.

658
00:57:02.881 --> 00:57:04.465
They didn't live there full-time.

659
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:06.133
And then.

660
00:57:06.217 --> 00:57:08.636
there was a lovely gardener's
cottage on the estate.

661
00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.930
which is the one my parents moved into.

662
00:57:11.014 --> 00:57:13.474
We had run of this place.

663
00:57:13.558 --> 00:57:16.019
I always say it was like our own park.

664
00:57:27.989 --> 00:57:29.783
That property was home.

665
00:57:33.078 --> 00:57:34.912
I knew we didn't own it.

666
00:57:34.996 --> 00:57:38.124
which ultimately meant
we had no control over it.

667
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.130
It was a complicated relationship.

668
00:57:44.214 --> 00:57:46.173
I know that the owner.

669
00:57:46.257 --> 00:57:48.092
she had my father by her
bedside when she died.

670
00:57:48.176 --> 00:57:50.845
That's what she wanted.
She relied on him for so much.

671
00:57:50.929 --> 00:57:53.514
They-They had a relationship.
for better or for worse.

672
00:57:53.598 --> 00:57:55.433
you know. as people.

673
00:57:57.519 --> 00:58:00.772
His domain was that 12 acres.

674
00:58:01.481 --> 00:58:03.482
He took pride in that.

675
00:58:03.566 --> 00:58:05.693
He poured into that. all of the freedom.

676
00:58:05.777 --> 00:58:09.781
all the ability to decide that
he didn't have in the world.

677
00:58:13.201 --> 00:58:17.205
So they were on that land
for almost 50 years.

678
00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:22.376
My father bought my mother
this cherry blossom tree.

679
00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:23.961
He planted it where they could see it

680
00:58:24.045 --> 00:58:27.007
from the window every day.
It was right there.

681
00:58:28.758 --> 00:58:30.551
Having their picture
taken in front of the tree.

682
00:58:30.635 --> 00:58:32.553
like this was the family tree.

683
00:58:32.637 --> 00:58:35.515
indicative of their own relationship.

684
00:58:40.061 --> 00:58:43.106
The roots of that tree represent me.

685
00:58:44.357 --> 00:58:47.818
my brothers...

686
00:58:47.902 --> 00:58:51.489
...our time as a family on that property.

687
00:58:56.870 --> 00:59:00.289
The last picture of my parents
in front of that cherry tree.

688
00:59:00.373 --> 00:59:01.749
as I understand it. it's the new owner

689
00:59:01.833 --> 00:59:04.043
who took that picture of them
on the day they left.

690
00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:05.295
in front of that tree.

691
00:59:11.051 --> 00:59:12.802
About five years after they moved.

692
00:59:12.886 --> 00:59:14.428
they received a copy of a letter.

693
00:59:14.512 --> 00:59:17.098
and it was from
the Westchester Land Trust.

694
00:59:17.182 --> 00:59:20.434
They found out that
a conservation easement

695
00:59:20.518 --> 00:59:22.687
had now been placed on this piece of land.

696
00:59:22.771 --> 00:59:25.606
and that means. in perpetuity.
nothing can be changed.

697
00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:28.442
"The Westchester Land Trust
thanks the new owner

698
00:59:28.526 --> 00:59:31.445
for his conservation-mindedness."

699
00:59:31.529 --> 00:59:35.741
Now. he'd been on the land
five. six years.

700
00:59:35.825 --> 00:59:38.202
What struck me was that
there was nothing in the letter

701
00:59:38.286 --> 00:59:39.578
thanking my parents.

702
00:59:39.662 --> 00:59:42.916
who had cared for that land
for nearly 50 years.

703
00:59:43.333 --> 00:59:47.003
And just like that. they were gone.

704
01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:14.071
When I-- The letter.

705
01:00:14.155 --> 01:00:16.115
that felt like a slap.

706
01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:20.953
I sent them a picture.
I said.

707
01:00:21.037 --> 01:00:22.538
"Here's where the cherry tree is

708
01:00:22.622 --> 01:00:24.916
"next to the house
I grew up in.

709
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.252
Can you go and make sure
it's still there?"

710
01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:32.715
But they sent the picture
of where the tree used to be.

711
01:00:32.799 --> 01:00:34.425
and there was nothing.

712
01:00:47.272 --> 01:00:50.524
It was like my mind was working
in so many different levels

713
01:00:50.608 --> 01:00:53.611
of just being devastated. of being angry.

714
01:00:53.695 --> 01:00:56.948
of being... surprised.

715
01:01:01.786 --> 01:01:03.455
It's personal!

716
01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.126
How do I say a thing that's personal

717
01:01:09.002 --> 01:01:11.545
and try to see
everybody else's point of view

718
01:01:11.629 --> 01:01:14.382
and not be mad?
'Cause the tree is gone!

719
01:01:14.466 --> 01:01:17.510
And how is a tree gone when
it should've been protected

720
01:01:17.594 --> 01:01:20.096
like everything else on that property?!

721
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:23.307
Why wasn't it protected?!
And nobody knew!

722
01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:24.976
And what I realized was

723
01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.769
that the people at
Westchester Land Trust

724
01:01:26.853 --> 01:01:29.105
didn't know the story!

725
01:01:29.189 --> 01:01:31.732
The new owners didn't know the story!

726
01:01:31.816 --> 01:01:32.942
They just didn't know!

727
01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:34.944
And why didn't they know the story

728
01:01:35.028 --> 01:01:38.447
of people who cared
for that land for 50 years?!

729
01:01:38.531 --> 01:01:42.243
How do you not know the story?!
How do we not know the story?!

730
01:01:42.327 --> 01:01:44.829
And that's-that's the place
where I show up. going.

731
01:01:44.913 --> 01:01:47.915
"How do we not know the story?"

732
01:01:53.004 --> 01:01:55.631
Somebody cut the tree.

733
01:01:55.715 --> 01:01:59.093
This is the stuff that always happens.

734
01:01:59.177 --> 01:02:01.471
Somebody always cuts the tree.

735
01:02:02.931 --> 01:02:05.266
Because it's not only history about trees!

736
01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:06.767
It is a history about us

737
01:02:06.851 --> 01:02:09.520
and who we are in relationship
to those trees!

738
01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:13.441
The people tending to it.

739
01:02:14.484 --> 01:02:16.152
every single day.

740
01:02:16.236 --> 01:02:19.905
who usually have the least amount of power

741
01:02:19.989 --> 01:02:21.991
in deciding what is important.

742
01:02:22.075 --> 01:02:25.953
But they are the ones who are
mostly there all the time.

743
01:02:26.037 --> 01:02:28.456
and often are answerable to it!

744
01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.833
Who are you gonna ask
something about that land.

745
01:02:30.917 --> 01:02:32.793
the people who own it?

746
01:02:32.877 --> 01:02:35.963
Or the people who worked it?

747
01:03:20.925 --> 01:03:25.012
Oh. I couldn't have become
a successful tree-planter

748
01:03:25.096 --> 01:03:27.849
if I wasn't an optimist.

749
01:03:28.558 --> 01:03:33.187
And so. I'm an optimist.

750
01:03:33.271 --> 01:03:36.857
This wood is some of
the best wood in the world.

751
01:03:36.941 --> 01:03:39.568
There's trees over
a thousand years old here.

752
01:03:39.652 --> 01:03:41.487
These trees are-are beautiful timber

753
01:03:41.571 --> 01:03:44.824
and get very high value
in the marketplace.

754
01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.914
I like an opportunity to plant.
and I come to a block like this.

755
01:03:51.998 --> 01:03:53.499
and I go. "Well. we'll plant it."

756
01:04:05.804 --> 01:04:08.473
I realized quite deeply.

757
01:04:09.641 --> 01:04:12.852
why I plant trees so
continuously without stopping.

758
01:04:12.936 --> 01:04:15.062
that is. year after year.

759
01:04:15.146 --> 01:04:18.399
Tree planting is a positive-feeling act.

760
01:04:46.302 --> 01:04:47.929
In early April each year.

761
01:04:48.013 --> 01:04:49.972
tree-planting crews assemble in Vancouver.

762
01:04:50.056 --> 01:04:53.351
Dirk Brinkman.
the contractor on this crew.

763
01:04:53.435 --> 01:04:54.769
hears from the logging company

764
01:04:54.853 --> 01:04:56.103
that the snow has almost melted

765
01:04:56.187 --> 01:04:58.648
from the Nass River Valley.
and starts the shopping.

766
01:04:58.732 --> 01:04:59.982
He tears about town.

767
01:05:00.066 --> 01:05:02.610
buying everything
from stovepipe. kerosene.

768
01:05:02.694 --> 01:05:04.654
and a crew cab pickup truck.

769
01:05:04.738 --> 01:05:08.033
to pounds of nuts. honey.
cheese. and brown rice.

770
01:05:20.587 --> 01:05:21.796
The crew load the crummies

771
01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.547
with four tons of food and gear.

772
01:05:25.717 --> 01:05:26.884
Still working north.

773
01:05:26.968 --> 01:05:29.804
they're a thousand miles
from Vancouver now.

774
01:05:29.888 --> 01:05:31.639
leaving the pavement and electricity

775
01:05:31.723 --> 01:05:33.349
and the noises of civilization

776
01:05:33.433 --> 01:05:35.184
for the quiet of the Nass Valley.

777
01:05:35.268 --> 01:05:37.187
and the sounds of logging.

778
01:05:47.197 --> 01:05:49.156
It was all clearcut
on both sides of the road.

779
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.618
And now. it's mature forests
on both sides of the road.

780
01:05:52.702 --> 01:05:54.453
or maturing forests
on both sides of the road.

781
01:05:54.537 --> 01:05:56.915
And we were the ones who planted it all.

782
01:05:57.248 --> 01:06:00.835
I've walked into stands
we planted 43 years ago.

783
01:06:00.919 --> 01:06:03.337
and I could not touch my fingers. on the--

784
01:06:03.421 --> 01:06:05.006
Wrapping my arms around the tree.

785
01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:08.050
I could just barely not.
Amazing growth.

786
01:06:08.134 --> 01:06:11.262
And-And that's tree after tree after tree.

787
01:06:11.346 --> 01:06:13.514
And. um...

788
01:06:13.598 --> 01:06:15.683
Of course. they've logged it.

789
01:06:28.947 --> 01:06:32.533
You've been the president of
this company since 1966 I think.

790
01:06:32.617 --> 01:06:35.244
And yet. you don't get delivered
to the office door

791
01:06:35.328 --> 01:06:37.455
in a long. black limousine.

792
01:06:37.706 --> 01:06:39.874
Uh. you fly coach.

793
01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:42.043
Where does that come from?

794
01:06:42.127 --> 01:06:43.795
I think it comes. uh...

795
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.301
from the way I. uh. grew up.

796
01:06:50.385 --> 01:06:52.637
And I guess mine was. uh...

797
01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:56.182
uh. maybe amplified by being kidnapped

798
01:06:56.266 --> 01:06:58.518
and being so. uh...

799
01:06:59.644 --> 01:07:00.603
in the limelight.

800
01:07:08.987 --> 01:07:11.864
I didn't ever feel that I wanted

801
01:07:11.948 --> 01:07:13.741
to prove that I was important.

802
01:07:18.329 --> 01:07:21.248
And I don't want this company
to be populated with people

803
01:07:21.332 --> 01:07:23.626
that are interested in appearances.

804
01:07:24.794 --> 01:07:25.837
Uh...

805
01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:29.591
- That's-- Mm-hmm.
- So I react negatively.

806
01:07:32.052 --> 01:07:34.679
So you're working with a tough nut.

807
01:07:35.221 --> 01:07:38.891
I've been in front
of the cameras for 90 years.

808
01:07:53.198 --> 01:07:55.616
speaker 1:
Ladies and gentlemen.

809
01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.410
In the interest of

810
01:07:57.494 --> 01:08:01.373
an even more convivial dinner than usual.

811
01:08:01.998 --> 01:08:04.375
this evening's occasion to honor.

812
01:08:04.459 --> 01:08:07.628
once again. by the Newcomen Society.

813
01:08:07.712 --> 01:08:09.338
Weyerhaeuser Company.

814
01:08:09.422 --> 01:08:12.049
speaker 2: It gives me great
pleasure to introduce

815
01:08:12.133 --> 01:08:13.426
George R. Weyerhaeuser.

816
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:15.511
President and Chief Executive Officer

817
01:08:15.595 --> 01:08:17.555
of the Weyerhaeuser Company.
George.

818
01:08:24.938 --> 01:08:26.147
Forests of North America

819
01:08:26.231 --> 01:08:29.150
have been part of a passing parade.

820
01:08:29.234 --> 01:08:31.319
and have played a formative role
in our society

821
01:08:31.403 --> 01:08:32.903
right from the very beginning.

822
01:08:35.073 --> 01:08:36.365
Through most of our history.

823
01:08:36.449 --> 01:08:39.202
the forest product industry's
been a nomadic one.

824
01:08:39.744 --> 01:08:42.496
And for the first 300 years
of the American experience.

825
01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.916
it's also been an extractive one.

826
01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:48.628
It is an industry that. through history.

827
01:08:48.712 --> 01:08:51.297
has been a key part of the US frontier

828
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:56.386
and has been led by rugged individualists.

829
01:09:00.015 --> 01:09:01.682
Timber was abundant.

830
01:09:01.766 --> 01:09:05.812
and it was a truism
that a pioneer hates a tree.

831
01:09:11.568 --> 01:09:15.029
In retrospect. some
have identified these men

832
01:09:15.113 --> 01:09:17.490
as rapers of the wilderness.

833
01:09:17.574 --> 01:09:19.826
As men who should've been restrained.

834
01:09:20.702 --> 01:09:22.870
The charge is unfair.

835
01:09:22.954 --> 01:09:25.831
They acted in response to
public need and public policy

836
01:09:25.915 --> 01:09:27.751
as it was then.

837
01:09:28.376 --> 01:09:30.462
Not as it is now.

838
01:09:33.298 --> 01:09:34.382
By the turn of the century.

839
01:09:34.466 --> 01:09:37.427
the era of cut-and-run was ending.

840
01:10:08.249 --> 01:10:09.584
In 1966.

841
01:10:09.668 --> 01:10:12.795
the company launched a campaign
under the slogan.

842
01:10:12.879 --> 01:10:14.673
"Timber is a crop."

843
01:10:15.882 --> 01:10:17.550
Nobody really believed it.

844
01:10:18.343 --> 01:10:19.802
It happened to be true.

845
01:10:22.847 --> 01:10:24.473
High-yield forestry

846
01:10:24.557 --> 01:10:27.602
is a shift away from the use
of trees grown by nature.

847
01:10:27.686 --> 01:10:30.855
towards trees selected for
their genetic characteristics

848
01:10:32.065 --> 01:10:34.526
and managed intensively by man.

849
01:10:43.034 --> 01:10:45.120
Those who plant trees

850
01:10:45.745 --> 01:10:49.457
give daily evidence of
their faith in the future...

851
01:10:52.043 --> 01:10:54.837
and in America.
Thank you.

852
01:11:28.913 --> 01:11:30.081
This is a fir.

853
01:11:31.207 --> 01:11:32.458
And that's a fir.

854
01:11:32.542 --> 01:11:36.087
And. you know. that's a 55-year-old tree.

855
01:11:36.171 --> 01:11:40.925
This was called a 55-year-old plantation.

856
01:11:41.009 --> 01:11:43.761
I was here when it was logged.

857
01:11:43.845 --> 01:11:46.097
and in 40 years. it'll be logged again.

858
01:11:46.181 --> 01:11:48.516
Well. in this way.
I'm actually 76.

859
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.102
so I've outgrown this stand.

860
01:11:52.354 --> 01:11:53.688
I'm certainly still of the school that

861
01:11:53.772 --> 01:11:55.398
if you cut it. you've gotta plant it.

862
01:11:55.482 --> 01:11:57.525
Reforestation is motherhood.

863
01:11:57.609 --> 01:11:59.568
Do it because we have to do it.

864
01:11:59.652 --> 01:12:02.781
not worry about whether
we can afford to do it.

865
01:12:04.449 --> 01:12:07.201
Today. Brinkman is 42 years old.

866
01:12:07.285 --> 01:12:09.578
with shorter hair. a computer.

867
01:12:09.662 --> 01:12:12.040
and $8 million worth of work this season.

868
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:17.211
Planting 37.5 million trees

869
01:12:17.295 --> 01:12:20.381
in BC. Alberta. Saskatchewan. and Ontario.

870
01:12:20.465 --> 01:12:22.466
Brinkman and Associates

871
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:25.219
is now the largest single contract

872
01:12:25.303 --> 01:12:27.638
tree-planting operation in Canada.

873
01:12:53.248 --> 01:12:54.916
It's more challenging.

874
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.336
but I wouldn't say it's as much
fresh clean fun for me.

875
01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.004
Not like it used to be in the bush.

876
01:13:07.637 --> 01:13:10.932
The reality is the tree market

877
01:13:11.016 --> 01:13:13.727
is more or less of a commodity market.

878
01:13:15.937 --> 01:13:18.606
I know I have moral complicity.

879
01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:20.650
like everyone that enjoys

880
01:13:20.734 --> 01:13:23.194
the value and benefits of wood.

881
01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.283
I am part of that whole human
experience where we use wood

882
01:13:29.367 --> 01:13:32.328
and we draw it out of these forests.

883
01:13:46.468 --> 01:13:49.721
I've planted 960.000 trees.

884
01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:52.139
The company celebrated

885
01:13:52.223 --> 01:13:56.102
its 1.5 billionth tree.

886
01:14:00.106 --> 01:14:01.482
Has any other company

887
01:14:01.566 --> 01:14:02.984
planted as many trees as you guys?

888
01:14:03.068 --> 01:14:05.486
Well. Weyerhaeuser.

889
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:07.697
I think
Weyerhaeuser celebrated

890
01:14:07.781 --> 01:14:10.909
their two-billionth tree some years ago.

891
01:14:14.746 --> 01:14:17.415
Weyerhaeuser started about
eight generations ago.

892
01:14:17.499 --> 01:14:20.543
Oh. eight generations ago?

893
01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:23.337
Well. how many generations
have I been working?

894
01:14:23.421 --> 01:14:24.756
Two at least.

895
01:14:27.092 --> 01:14:30.303
I've got children.
I've got grandchildren.

896
01:14:30.387 --> 01:14:33.180
When you reach my age. that cycle of life

897
01:14:33.264 --> 01:14:37.143
and the tree's cycle of life
seem very vulnerable.

898
01:14:38.812 --> 01:14:40.104
Yes. the tree is vulnerable.

899
01:14:40.188 --> 01:14:43.899
and it depends on the planter
finding the right spot

900
01:14:43.983 --> 01:14:45.651
and...

901
01:14:45.735 --> 01:14:47.862
wishing it the best as he moves on.

902
01:15:12.303 --> 01:15:13.763
Which one has poison ivy?!

903
01:15:13.847 --> 01:15:15.890
There's no poison ivy back here.

904
01:15:15.974 --> 01:15:19.144
There's English ivy. That's what
all this green stuff is.

905
01:15:19.519 --> 01:15:21.312
Okay. up.

906
01:15:21.396 --> 01:15:23.898
It's ripping the bark off.

907
01:15:23.982 --> 01:15:26.901
Here and here...

908
01:15:27.318 --> 01:15:29.236
and all the way up here.

909
01:15:32.949 --> 01:15:34.241
My grandpa.

910
01:15:34.325 --> 01:15:38.747
he started developing
Alzheimer's when he was 81.

911
01:15:45.545 --> 01:15:49.090
It's kind of like the tree
is Papa's brain.

912
01:15:49.174 --> 01:15:53.594
and the vines on the tree
is the vines in his brain.

913
01:16:00.268 --> 01:16:01.936
It's just like...

914
01:16:02.479 --> 01:16:04.147
there's a war.

915
01:16:11.821 --> 01:16:14.407
I feel like lately.
I'm having trouble

916
01:16:14.491 --> 01:16:17.702
seeing things as they really are.

917
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:26.627
I'm seeing my dad every day

918
01:16:26.711 --> 01:16:30.798
and he looks like a shell
of who he used to be.

919
01:16:35.053 --> 01:16:38.723
I just look at these vines all around me.

920
01:16:39.766 --> 01:16:45.230
I'm obsessed with the tree
being strangled to death.

921
01:16:53.071 --> 01:16:56.324
Okay.

922
01:17:03.039 --> 01:17:04.290
Alright.

923
01:20:49.432 --> 01:20:51.601
You're looking at a cleaned-up version

924
01:20:51.685 --> 01:20:53.395
of a total nightmare.

925
01:20:58.566 --> 01:21:02.987
She showed up and parked down
below the workshop.

926
01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:11.537
She came up to the top of the property.

927
01:21:11.621 --> 01:21:15.791
and... destroyed the trees.

928
01:21:28.596 --> 01:21:31.016
She entered...

929
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.686
by breaking down the front door.

930
01:21:41.609 --> 01:21:44.070
Yeah. I don't know. I don't
know what you make of that.

931
01:21:45.363 --> 01:21:46.280
Yep.

932
01:21:47.866 --> 01:21:50.243
This is the most disturbing room to me.

933
01:21:52.203 --> 01:21:55.040
This is where the knife was. right there.

934
01:21:57.250 --> 01:22:00.045
But I understand her hatred towards me.

935
01:22:01.796 --> 01:22:05.967
I don't understand why she would do this.

936
01:22:12.599 --> 01:22:15.142
The video footage that we
have shows her in here.

937
01:22:15.226 --> 01:22:17.353
frantically moving back and forth.

938
01:22:17.437 --> 01:22:19.981
breaking things. destroying things.

939
01:22:20.065 --> 01:22:22.525
Uh. and when she leaves. she's naked.

940
01:22:28.239 --> 01:22:29.991
I actually haven't watched the footage.

941
01:22:30.075 --> 01:22:32.327
and I don't plan to.

942
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:37.164
I can wipe the blood away.

943
01:22:37.248 --> 01:22:39.750
fix the drywall. find a new door.

944
01:22:39.834 --> 01:22:42.670
I mean. the damage inside is all fixable.

945
01:22:42.754 --> 01:22:45.006
The damage outside is...

946
01:22:45.632 --> 01:22:46.674
I don't know.

947
01:22:52.764 --> 01:22:56.475
It felt like destroying the trees
was her trying to. like.

948
01:22:56.559 --> 01:22:58.853
take a dagger to my heart kind of a thing.

949
01:22:58.937 --> 01:23:01.773
Like. that was the jugular move.

950
01:23:08.613 --> 01:23:11.449
She walked down here
and ripped that piece off.

951
01:23:13.952 --> 01:23:17.705
Just as like
a-a final "fuck you." I guess.

952
01:23:17.789 --> 01:23:19.123
I don't know.

953
01:23:19.207 --> 01:23:21.667
It would be like
cutting somebody's leg off.

954
01:23:21.751 --> 01:23:23.377
what she did to the trees.

955
01:23:23.461 --> 01:23:25.963
dismember them
for the rest of their lives.

956
01:23:26.047 --> 01:23:30.343
Eighty years of growth
in that piece right there.

957
01:23:30.427 --> 01:23:32.429
So you just don't get it back.

958
01:23:33.638 --> 01:23:35.806
But the one that really--

959
01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:37.726
the one that really sucked...

960
01:23:38.476 --> 01:23:39.769
Baker.

961
01:23:43.982 --> 01:23:45.942
It's just a matter of time now.

962
01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.989
It was like that.

963
01:23:52.073 --> 01:23:53.282
And it flipped over

964
01:23:53.366 --> 01:23:57.037
and landed right on the top
of the tree and...

965
01:23:58.538 --> 01:24:02.083
cr-- uh. crushed half of it.
So. um...

966
01:24:02.167 --> 01:24:04.419
You know.
Baker and I go back like...

967
01:24:05.545 --> 01:24:06.712
to my time in Japan.

968
01:24:09.215 --> 01:24:10.800
Very early in my apprenticeship in Japan.

969
01:24:10.884 --> 01:24:13.177
I acquired Baker.

970
01:24:13.261 --> 01:24:15.930
And it waited for me.
and I came back from Japan.

971
01:24:16.014 --> 01:24:18.474
I tried to repot Baker the first time

972
01:24:18.558 --> 01:24:19.851
into a bonsai container.

973
01:24:20.477 --> 01:24:22.687
And it had all kinds of problems.

974
01:24:22.771 --> 01:24:26.023
and it was very challenging.
and it almost died.

975
01:24:26.107 --> 01:24:28.526
But it didn't die.

976
01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:30.945
And so then.
I grafted roots onto Baker

977
01:24:31.029 --> 01:24:33.239
to make the next repotting easier.

978
01:24:33.323 --> 01:24:36.492
And I thought that
the root-grafts had taken.

979
01:24:36.576 --> 01:24:38.619
And I cut the native root system off.

980
01:24:38.703 --> 01:24:41.622
and I found out that very few
of the root-grafts had taken.

981
01:24:41.706 --> 01:24:44.542
And it almost died.
But it didn't die.

982
01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:50.089
So. this fucking tree
has been through. like.

983
01:24:50.173 --> 01:24:52.842
every. you know. painful...

984
01:24:53.426 --> 01:24:56.596
moment of growth
in my professional career.

985
01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.473
And it's the one tree that.
like. I just look at every day.

986
01:24:59.557 --> 01:25:01.851
and it's like. you know. "You and me.

987
01:25:01.935 --> 01:25:06.063
We're the only ones that know
what this took to make."

988
01:25:06.147 --> 01:25:09.317
You know. like.
"You've been firsthand in it

989
01:25:09.401 --> 01:25:10.985
from the beginning. in the fight."

990
01:25:11.069 --> 01:25:12.737
So for that tree...

991
01:25:17.826 --> 01:25:19.785
for that tree to get. uh--

992
01:25:19.869 --> 01:25:21.746
that was the one.

993
01:25:25.709 --> 01:25:28.419
I don't care about my house. uh. at all.

994
01:25:28.503 --> 01:25:33.507
but I-- but I cared about that. so... yeah.

995
01:25:33.591 --> 01:25:36.802
And unfortunately. that's the
one that's probably gonna die.

996
01:25:41.433 --> 01:25:44.769
He landed there. so...

997
01:26:11.087 --> 01:26:13.923
My earliest memories

998
01:26:14.007 --> 01:26:17.927
are of being outdoors.

999
01:26:30.357 --> 01:26:33.276
From the moment
I'd wake up in the morning.

1000
01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:34.610
I wouldn't be back inside

1001
01:26:34.694 --> 01:26:37.071
until I was called in when it got dark.

1002
01:26:39.532 --> 01:26:41.367
Everything I needed was outside.

1003
01:26:41.451 --> 01:26:44.704
It was wildly exciting.

1004
01:26:48.667 --> 01:26:50.793
And then. of course. getting older.

1005
01:26:50.877 --> 01:26:52.837
I kind of fell away from that.

1006
01:26:55.465 --> 01:26:58.009
So. this project.

1007
01:26:58.093 --> 01:27:00.303
to me. was kind of a way

1008
01:27:00.387 --> 01:27:04.307
to reconnect my relationship

1009
01:27:04.391 --> 01:27:06.058
with the natural world.

1010
01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.401
The first trees
I photographed

1011
01:27:15.485 --> 01:27:17.445
almost 20 years ago.

1012
01:27:19.406 --> 01:27:22.533
At the beginning. I was just
drawn to their strength.

1013
01:27:22.617 --> 01:27:26.329
and their power. and their size.

1014
01:27:27.872 --> 01:27:31.292
Now. I see this fragility
that I never saw.

1015
01:27:33.503 --> 01:27:36.297
This preciousness about them.

1016
01:27:55.525 --> 01:28:01.238
Some species only grow in
certain parts of the world.

1017
01:28:01.322 --> 01:28:04.868
A lot of them are really
quite hard to get to.

1018
01:28:07.746 --> 01:28:11.832
Say. for example. the
dragon's blood trees in Yemen

1019
01:28:11.916 --> 01:28:16.087
or quiver trees in Namibia.

1020
01:28:16.171 --> 01:28:19.840
These baobabs in Madagascar.

1021
01:28:19.924 --> 01:28:23.219
A strangler fig in Cambodia.

1022
01:28:23.303 --> 01:28:26.306
Bristlecone pine. California.

1023
01:28:29.768 --> 01:28:32.937
I make it a quest to be able
to share these trees

1024
01:28:33.021 --> 01:28:36.775
with other people
that wouldn't be able to go.

1025
01:28:43.615 --> 01:28:46.826
When I was in Madagascar this last trip...

1026
01:28:53.792 --> 01:28:56.586
...I went back to see this tree.

1027
01:28:57.712 --> 01:28:59.964
It's just such a fabulous tree.

1028
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:14.979
And it is no longer there.

1029
01:29:17.941 --> 01:29:20.026
It's just one of the...

1030
01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:22.821
the large baobabs that's died.

1031
01:29:26.366 --> 01:29:29.243
This was the first warning bell.

1032
01:29:29.327 --> 01:29:30.995
the death of this tree.

1033
01:29:31.079 --> 01:29:34.415
because those countries
are becoming warmer.

1034
01:29:34.499 --> 01:29:36.751
and they have less rain.

1035
01:29:47.679 --> 01:29:48.763
But now.

1036
01:29:48.847 --> 01:29:52.183
when I've seen so many that have fallen.

1037
01:29:52.851 --> 01:29:56.604
now. I am very aware
of how fragile they are.

1038
01:30:18.835 --> 01:30:21.545
I was thinking there would be nothing.

1039
01:30:21.629 --> 01:30:23.506
But there's a stump.

1040
01:30:24.924 --> 01:30:27.635
Which. I have to tell you.
I actually don't think--

1041
01:30:27.719 --> 01:30:29.887
know that I want the stump to be moved.

1042
01:30:29.971 --> 01:30:31.305
I just. uh...

1043
01:30:31.389 --> 01:30:33.599
I'm wondering if we-- Um.

1044
01:30:33.683 --> 01:30:36.686
Brendan!
Can we-- Do we--

1045
01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:39.647
Can we let-let that stump stay there?

1046
01:30:39.731 --> 01:30:41.857
Absolutely.

1047
01:30:44.569 --> 01:30:48.072
Yes. That was a happy thing. That's good.

1048
01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:52.952
It makes me happy
to know that this is here.

1049
01:30:54.871 --> 01:30:59.918
All the rings makes me think
about what secrets the tree has.

1050
01:31:05.924 --> 01:31:07.592
Yeah.

1051
01:31:09.052 --> 01:31:10.720
Um... yeah.

1052
01:31:22.023 --> 01:31:25.026
That tree was about my parents.

1053
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:27.236
It wasn't about the owner.

1054
01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:29.197
It wasn't even about the land.

1055
01:31:29.739 --> 01:31:32.617
That tree symbolizes their presence

1056
01:31:34.119 --> 01:31:38.372
and how we privilege what's
in the book in the library.

1057
01:31:38.456 --> 01:31:39.916
This is the history.

1058
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.878
And how many people
are not in there. right?

1059
01:31:43.962 --> 01:31:45.546
Which doesn't mean they don't exist.

1060
01:31:45.630 --> 01:31:48.049
which doesn't mean it isn't true.

1061
01:31:48.299 --> 01:31:50.468
um. and how we all lose.

1062
01:31:50.552 --> 01:31:52.762
We all lose when that happens.

1063
01:31:52.846 --> 01:31:55.556
Some of us don't feel it too much.

1064
01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:59.018
And the rest of us.
it's like an open wound.

1065
01:31:59.102 --> 01:32:00.686
all the time.

1066
01:32:12.157 --> 01:32:15.242
I lost more trees
than I've lost in 11 years.

1067
01:32:17.662 --> 01:32:21.123
When a tree dies that
I've actually...

1068
01:32:21.207 --> 01:32:23.001
had my hands on.

1069
01:32:24.502 --> 01:32:25.837
I don't...

1070
01:32:26.254 --> 01:32:27.755
I don't really feel good. like.

1071
01:32:27.839 --> 01:32:30.008
surrounding myself with that tree.

1072
01:32:33.178 --> 01:32:36.180
A lot of times.
I will autopsy the tree

1073
01:32:36.264 --> 01:32:37.515
and then I try to move on.

1074
01:32:41.269 --> 01:32:44.731
But I don't typically keep them
around to look at them.

1075
01:32:47.984 --> 01:32:50.612
Do you have a name
for this part of the garden?

1076
01:32:52.197 --> 01:32:54.448
No... nope.

1077
01:32:54.532 --> 01:32:56.785
No. I hope I never have one.

1078
01:33:00.288 --> 01:33:02.332
Okay.

1079
01:33:06.586 --> 01:33:09.255
This is the last one
that died from the. uh...

1080
01:33:31.736 --> 01:33:35.407
When the trees were vandalized.

1081
01:33:36.199 --> 01:33:39.661
it was like losing a big piece of my soul.

1082
01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:43.831
To destroy this living organism

1083
01:33:43.915 --> 01:33:46.876
that couldn't contribute
an ill piece of will in any way

1084
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:50.171
and was completely defenseless.

1085
01:33:50.255 --> 01:33:55.259
It's just. um. what's so disturbing about...

1086
01:33:55.343 --> 01:33:57.845
these sort of inevitable forces
that keep moving forward.

1087
01:33:57.929 --> 01:34:00.264
It was really...
It was a bummer.

1088
01:34:41.473 --> 01:34:43.391
This is the end of

1089
01:34:43.475 --> 01:34:45.601
a 200 or 300-year

1090
01:34:45.685 --> 01:34:47.687
narrative arc for a few of these.

1091
01:34:55.570 --> 01:34:56.821
I had a pretty intimate relationship

1092
01:34:56.905 --> 01:34:59.783
with that dead tree.
which is just so hard for.

1093
01:35:00.617 --> 01:35:03.286
I think. people to really understand. So...

1094
01:35:52.210 --> 01:35:54.003
reporter 1:
The Pacific Bonsai Museum

1095
01:35:54.087 --> 01:35:57.089
says two stolen bonsai trees
have been returned.

1096
01:35:57.173 --> 01:36:00.801
Security guards found
the bonsai at 11:00 last night.

1097
01:36:00.885 --> 01:36:03.054
They are more than 70 years old.

1098
01:36:03.138 --> 01:36:04.305
They're worth thousands of dollars.

1099
01:36:04.389 --> 01:36:05.848
reporter 2:
Security guards found them

1100
01:36:05.932 --> 01:36:07.391
sitting in the middle of the road.

1101
01:36:07.475 --> 01:36:08.851
leading to the museum.

1102
01:36:08.935 --> 01:36:11.270
No one has claimed
responsibility for the theft.

1103
01:36:11.354 --> 01:36:14.649
I pulled in and immediately
walked up to the trees.

1104
01:36:14.733 --> 01:36:16.567
and they were facing each other.

1105
01:36:16.651 --> 01:36:19.403
And it almost looked like
they were bowing and saying.

1106
01:36:19.487 --> 01:36:21.489
"We are back home."

1107
01:36:21.573 --> 01:36:24.575
And it was-- Yeah.
I'm gonna start crying again.

1108
01:36:24.659 --> 01:36:27.495
It was very emotional.
Very emotional.

1109
01:36:34.919 --> 01:36:36.712
I was 9 years old.

1110
01:36:38.465 --> 01:36:41.634
The little trees. that really took ahold.

1111
01:36:45.263 --> 01:36:49.434
I don't have too many
artistry tendencies. and. uh...

1112
01:36:50.226 --> 01:36:52.770
I think it took a certain
amount of imagination

1113
01:36:52.854 --> 01:36:55.314
by me to build a headquarters.

1114
01:37:04.866 --> 01:37:07.702
We hired some very fine people

1115
01:37:07.786 --> 01:37:11.998
to work within the bonsai empire.

1116
01:37:12.082 --> 01:37:14.584
Some made a living by it.

1117
01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.712
Being a bonsai professional.

1118
01:37:17.796 --> 01:37:20.047
there's no doubt in my mind that

1119
01:37:20.131 --> 01:37:21.632
the Weyerhaeuser Collection.

1120
01:37:21.716 --> 01:37:23.843
which is now
Pacific Bonsai Museum.

1121
01:37:23.927 --> 01:37:25.970
has been a centrifuge
for bonsai culture here.

1122
01:37:26.054 --> 01:37:28.347
And right now. this is
the epicenter of bonsai culture

1123
01:37:28.431 --> 01:37:29.933
in North America.

1124
01:37:35.355 --> 01:37:38.065
I think that the bonsai. in particular.

1125
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:39.817
are valuable in their own right.

1126
01:37:39.901 --> 01:37:41.193
They're kinda unique.

1127
01:37:41.277 --> 01:37:45.490
They really are worthy
of. uh. whatever it takes.

1128
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:54.248
Because of the funding
that Weyerhaeuser provided.

1129
01:37:54.332 --> 01:37:56.584
because collections purchase trees.

1130
01:37:56.668 --> 01:37:59.587
there was a push for bonsai
to be an art form.

1131
01:38:02.173 --> 01:38:05.051
And that has informed a lot of us.

1132
01:38:06.011 --> 01:38:07.929
Did Weyerhaeuser open the door

1133
01:38:08.013 --> 01:38:11.099
for me to have a career
as a bonsai professional?

1134
01:38:12.726 --> 01:38:14.310
Absolutely he did.

1135
01:38:24.988 --> 01:38:27.240
It looked like there was nothing here.

1136
01:38:30.702 --> 01:38:32.996
Wonder if that's that Weyerhaeuser.

1137
01:38:56.436 --> 01:38:58.104
Jordan.

1138
01:38:59.064 --> 01:39:01.607
- Whose tree is that. J?
- My great grandfather.

1139
01:39:01.691 --> 01:39:03.985
- Yeah. great-grandpa.
- That's your great-grandpa's!

1140
01:39:27.133 --> 01:39:28.426
You can go into the forest.

1141
01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:31.012
and you can feel.
"Oh boy. this is really nice."

1142
01:39:31.096 --> 01:39:34.099
and. "This is very peaceful"
and everything.

1143
01:39:37.602 --> 01:39:40.980
If you look at bonsai. it's different.

1144
01:39:41.064 --> 01:39:43.358
You're looking at a single plant.

1145
01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:49.114
And it's telling you. "This is me."

1146
01:39:52.742 --> 01:39:56.204
That tree is my father's legacy.
I mean. that's him.

1147
01:40:06.756 --> 01:40:08.258
Wanna touch the needles?

1148
01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:10.801
Touch the needle. Up there.

1149
01:40:10.885 --> 01:40:13.138
Right there. Be gentle.

1150
01:40:26.776 --> 01:40:28.819
I just remember having to water them all.

1151
01:40:28.903 --> 01:40:31.781
- Well then. you've
watered that one a few times.
- Oh yeah.

1152
01:40:31.865 --> 01:40:34.159
It must remember you.

1153
01:40:36.369 --> 01:40:39.413
- Whoa. Oh. you are!
- Stand there. Oh.

1154
01:40:39.497 --> 01:40:42.166
Just barely!

1155
01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:44.460
- It's your great-grandpa's.
- Yeah.

1156
01:40:44.544 --> 01:40:45.795
If you don't remember him.

1157
01:40:45.879 --> 01:40:47.589
you can at least remember the tree.

1158
01:40:48.173 --> 01:40:50.758
- It'll outlive all of us.
- Yeah.

1159
01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:07.900
When an independent historian sits down.

1160
01:41:07.984 --> 01:41:10.528
not the company-paid historian.

1161
01:41:10.612 --> 01:41:12.321
10 or 15 years from now.

1162
01:41:12.405 --> 01:41:13.990
and writes the history of Weyerhaeuser.

1163
01:41:14.074 --> 01:41:16.075
what would you hope they would say about

1164
01:41:16.159 --> 01:41:18.119
the George Weyerhaeuser era?

1165
01:41:18.203 --> 01:41:21.330
Which is gonna be 25 years long here.

1166
01:41:21.414 --> 01:41:23.958
What would you like to be remembered for?

1167
01:41:24.042 --> 01:41:26.294
I'd like to be able to pass through

1168
01:41:26.378 --> 01:41:29.464
as large an element as I can
of what I thought...

1169
01:41:30.173 --> 01:41:33.468
- this company was when I inherited it.
- That's it.

1170
01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:37.138
And I think it was somethin'
pretty tremendous.

1171
01:41:37.222 --> 01:41:40.725
If there's one thing I would cherish. um...

1172
01:41:42.143 --> 01:41:43.812
it's my word.

1173
01:41:44.688 --> 01:41:45.980
I... I--

1174
01:41:46.064 --> 01:41:48.608
You can absolutely count on me.

1175
01:41:49.234 --> 01:41:52.487
And if you can't.
I'm the guy that's hurt.

1176
01:42:02.747 --> 01:42:05.250
What's your favorite tree on the property?

1177
01:42:06.167 --> 01:42:08.420
- My favorite tree?
- Yeah.

1178
01:42:13.925 --> 01:42:15.801
Oh. I don't know.

1179
01:42:15.885 --> 01:42:17.845
There's some damn big ones.

1180
01:42:22.392 --> 01:42:23.935
I think you oughta get out your clippers

1181
01:42:24.019 --> 01:42:25.478
and work on your bonsai. Dad.

1182
01:42:25.562 --> 01:42:29.023
It's. uh... it's losing shape.

1183
01:42:29.107 --> 01:42:30.650
Yeah.

1184
01:42:34.279 --> 01:42:36.865
Beautiful little things.
Yeah.

1185
01:42:39.159 --> 01:42:40.701
They look fine.

1186
01:42:43.329 --> 01:42:45.581
Nothing is forever.

1187
01:42:48.209 --> 01:42:50.503
I'd like to think it is.

1188
01:42:50.587 --> 01:42:52.839
Doesn't usually work that way.

1189
01:42:53.757 --> 01:42:55.425
But it may.

1190
01:43:34.005 --> 01:43:36.257
Some of the trees
I've photographed

1191
01:43:36.341 --> 01:43:39.344
have been as much as 4.000 years old.

1192
01:43:42.305 --> 01:43:44.265
I wanted to use a process

1193
01:43:44.349 --> 01:43:46.767
that would reflect this kind of age

1194
01:43:46.851 --> 01:43:49.354
and this kind of aesthetic.

1195
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:54.233
With platinum printing.

1196
01:43:54.317 --> 01:43:57.570
the metals are very fine

1197
01:43:58.738 --> 01:44:02.617
and they embed themselves into the paper.

1198
01:44:06.538 --> 01:44:10.207
The tree will be living
within the fibers of the paper.

1199
01:44:10.291 --> 01:44:14.295
so they become one.

1200
01:44:52.417 --> 01:44:57.171
Platinum printing is the most archival
process that there is.

1201
01:44:57.255 --> 01:45:01.217
and it could last for thousands of years.

1202
01:45:02.052 --> 01:45:06.389
I mean. it can live on
forever on a piece of paper.

1203
01:45:10.143 --> 01:45:12.228
The tree is gone forever.

1204
01:45:12.896 --> 01:45:16.524
Will we remember it?
Yes. of course. Fondly.

1205
01:45:17.650 --> 01:45:19.652
But. the tree is gone. and. for me.

1206
01:45:19.736 --> 01:45:23.490
that's. you know. just
heartbreaking beyond words.

1207
01:45:29.204 --> 01:45:32.791
Every life form has but one goal.

1208
01:45:36.711 --> 01:45:41.716
The goal of an oak seed is
to become a mature oak tree.

1209
01:45:44.719 --> 01:45:48.180
I feel that the way forward

1210
01:45:48.264 --> 01:45:49.641
is through beauty.

1211
01:45:51.267 --> 01:45:53.937
This was a good departure for me.

1212
01:45:55.397 --> 01:45:57.399
to go back to the beginning.

1213
01:46:21.089 --> 01:46:24.467
- Look at all this moisture.
- It's moist on top.

1214
01:46:26.302 --> 01:46:29.180
Certainly a good place for a fir tree.

1215
01:46:32.642 --> 01:46:34.519
Now. there's a tree.

1216
01:46:35.395 --> 01:46:37.355
And we'll see how that grows.

1217
01:46:38.189 --> 01:46:41.067
Should we go to the tree?
Do you wanna come with me?

1218
01:46:41.359 --> 01:46:43.653
Come on. let's go!

1219
01:46:52.037 --> 01:46:55.414
So we call this the Tree Graveyard.

1220
01:46:55.498 --> 01:46:58.167
One day. the tide rose up so high

1221
01:46:58.251 --> 01:47:01.963
that it was able to put that log there.

1222
01:47:02.047 --> 01:47:04.090
Go faster.
Run. run. run.

1223
01:47:04.883 --> 01:47:07.844
This isn't the graveyard.
This is the juniper.

1224
01:47:08.219 --> 01:47:09.971
This is the juniper!

1225
01:47:10.055 --> 01:47:12.557
It's the fake graveyard!

1226
01:47:13.183 --> 01:47:16.519
'Cause you can see
why this tree is almost dead.

1227
01:47:16.603 --> 01:47:18.897
'Cause it split in half.

1228
01:47:19.773 --> 01:47:22.024
But it's still alive.

1229
01:47:22.108 --> 01:47:24.068
It's still living.

1230
01:47:29.824 --> 01:47:30.783
When it first split.

1231
01:47:30.867 --> 01:47:33.369
I could look inside the fresh split

1232
01:47:33.453 --> 01:47:34.996
and see how old it was.

1233
01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:38.499
- How old is it?
- About 800 years old.

1234
01:47:46.007 --> 01:47:49.552
A lot of things have happened
to-- in each person's life.

1235
01:47:49.636 --> 01:47:52.179
while this tree just grows here slowly.

1236
01:47:52.263 --> 01:47:54.224
Isn't that kind of amazing?

1237
01:47:56.851 --> 01:48:00.021
Do you know how many lifetimes
this tree grew?

1238
01:48:00.105 --> 01:48:02.774
It's 10 times as old as I am.

1239
01:48:10.115 --> 01:48:12.199
Half of the tree's genome

1240
01:48:12.283 --> 01:48:14.953
and our genome is identical.

1241
01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.375
The story is the same.

1242
01:48:37.267 --> 01:48:41.146
When living things defy the impossible.

1243
01:48:41.813 --> 01:48:44.274
we quantify it as a will to live.

1244
01:48:45.734 --> 01:48:47.360
The big risk with Baker was that

1245
01:48:47.444 --> 01:48:48.986
the whole tree was gonna die.

1246
01:48:55.952 --> 01:48:58.663
From the greatest tragedies.

1247
01:48:59.039 --> 01:49:02.250
generally. something
significant comes from it.

1248
01:49:05.128 --> 01:49:06.712
Maybe something's gonna happen here.

1249
01:49:06.796 --> 01:49:09.131
and the tree's gonna survive.
and I'm gonna be like.

1250
01:49:09.215 --> 01:49:12.260
"How did that happen?
How do I duplicate that?

1251
01:49:12.344 --> 01:49:15.304
How do I learn from that?
How do I understand that?"

1252
01:49:15.388 --> 01:49:16.597
And then suddenly. you'll be like.

1253
01:49:16.681 --> 01:49:19.351
"Wow. I'm so glad
this got pushed off the bench."

1254
01:49:20.018 --> 01:49:21.727
At this point. it's a little
hard to talk like that.

1255
01:49:21.811 --> 01:49:23.104
but you never know.
You never know.

1256
01:49:23.188 --> 01:49:25.606
It's happened a lot
with this specific tree.

1257
01:49:25.690 --> 01:49:28.401
so maybe it's got more in it.
I don't know. We'll see.

1258
01:49:34.366 --> 01:49:36.659
Let's be done talking about Baker.

1259
01:50:00.892 --> 01:50:01.642
Hm.

1260
01:50:10.985 --> 01:50:14.822
There is. uh. at each turn in the road.

1261
01:50:14.906 --> 01:50:17.283
there's a moment where

1262
01:50:17.367 --> 01:50:19.827
a cataclysmic "something" happens.

1263
01:50:19.911 --> 01:50:22.663
Cold. heat. fire. volcano. whatever.

1264
01:50:22.747 --> 01:50:25.124
And then. the tree could die.

1265
01:50:25.208 --> 01:50:27.001
or the tree can live.

1266
01:50:27.085 --> 01:50:28.586
But it's always gonna
carry the scar of it.

1267
01:50:28.670 --> 01:50:30.922
So suddenly. you have this turn.

1268
01:50:31.423 --> 01:50:33.633
That one died. this one lived.

1269
01:50:33.717 --> 01:50:35.051
And then. there's another turn.

1270
01:50:35.135 --> 01:50:36.010
This trunk died.

1271
01:50:36.094 --> 01:50:38.179
this trunk receded. but it's still alive.

1272
01:50:38.263 --> 01:50:41.724
And it just builds on itself with time

1273
01:50:41.808 --> 01:50:43.684
and unpredictable and predictable events

1274
01:50:43.768 --> 01:50:45.436
to become this.

1275
01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:46.812
That's a story.

1276
01:50:46.896 --> 01:50:50.734
That's a--
That's a-a life well lived.

1277
01:50:53.069 --> 01:50:54.445
I want that.

1278
01:50:54.529 --> 01:50:56.364
I want that for myself.

1279
01:50:56.448 --> 01:50:59.117
I want that for the human race.

1280
01:51:38.323 --> 01:51:40.825
Hoo!

1281
01:51:58.885 --> 01:51:59.844
Okay. pull!

1282
01:52:02.555 --> 01:52:06.100
Okay. Okay. stop!

1283
01:52:09.354 --> 01:52:12.065
