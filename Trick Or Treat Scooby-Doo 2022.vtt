Whoa!

Ruh-roh!

8
00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.281
Um. is that.
like. a good "ruh-roh"
or a bad "ruh-roh"?

9
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.718
Never mind! I figured it out!

10
00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:59.192
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

11
00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:17.975
Here they come.

12
00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:20.711
Everything's in place.
Everyone ready?

13
00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.317
Ready.

14
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.219
Set.

15
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.256
No!

16
00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:41.434
Whoa!

17
00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.206
Whoa!

18
00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:48.739
There goes my rental deposit!

19
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.374
I hate cats.

20
00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.780
Whoa!

21
00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.617
Velma! Daphne! It's go time!

22
00:02:56.276 --> 00:03:00.747
More like. Cat Man. don't!
Am I right. Scoob?

23
00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.749
Good show. Mystery Inc!

24
00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:09.287
You've certainly
lived up to your
most formidable reputation.

25
00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.056
Now let's see
who this Cat Man really is.

26
00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:18.364
Actually. Inspector.
I think Ms. Cat Man
might be more accurate.

27
00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.901
Olive Khadka!

28
00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:25.536
But why?

29
00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:28.673
Your family
owns the ski resort.

30
00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.674
Exactly.

31
00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:32.677
But my father plans
to leave it all
to his new wife. Heena.

32
00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:33.711
She's half his age. you know.

33
00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.781
What do you think. Velma?
Does it match the others?

34
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.483
Let's find out.

35
00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:40.818
...creature
to scare away skiers

36
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.186
and force the lodge
out of business.

37
00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:46.759
And I would have
gotten away with it. too.
if it weren't for...

38
00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:50.828
Hey. where did
those meddling kids go?

39
00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.006
Wow.
just as I suspected.

40
00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.709
The materials used
to make the Cat Man suit

41
00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.911
are identical
to every other costume

42
00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:09.682
from the criminals
we've captured.

43
00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:15.688
Henry Bascombe's
Space Kook suit.

44
00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:18.956
Captain Cutler's
ghost diver suit.

45
00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.860
That freaky ghost clown.
Harry the Hypnotist.

46
00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:26.864
All starting with the Black Knight. Mr.
Wickles.

47
00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.633
I always thought
it was a strange coincidence

48
00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:33.137
that all our cases
seemed to involve
some supernatural creature.

49
00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.705
But it wasn't a coincidence.

50
00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:37.441
These costumes
were created by one person.

51
00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:40.444
a secret mastermind
hiding behind the curtain

52
00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:43.716
and pulling the strings
all this time.

53
00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.986
Coco Diablo!

54
00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:18.618
Happy Halloween.
I'm Coco Diablo.

55
00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:23.688
I'm here for the. uh. VIP tour.

56
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.489
Of course you are.

57
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:27.226
Right this way.

58
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:30.561
As you can see.

59
00:05:30.563 --> 00:05:34.465
we manufacture a wide variety
of popular Halloween costumes.

60
00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:37.368
Classic gorilla. Silly hot dog.

61
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.841
Treacherous maven.
We make it all here.

62
00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.475
Of course.
here at Diablo Costumes.

63
00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:50.748
we pride ourselves
in only making safe.
family-friendly products.

64
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.618
Of course.

65
00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:55.453
We only use
the best materials here.

66
00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:59.256
None of those chintzy.
disposable synthetics

67
00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.292
other companies rely upon.

68
00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:06.366
And our costumes
are crafted by true artisans.

69
00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.300
Excuse me. Miss Diablo.

70
00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:12.303
How many times
must I tell you
not to interrupt

71
00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:13.771
when I'm with a client?

72
00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.773
But I've just completed
the prototype

73
00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:18.075
for next year's
Dracula costume.

74
00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:19.677
Dracula. again!

75
00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:25.518
Really. Trevor.
can't you design
anything other than Dracula?

76
00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:29.956
Well. I can try to. but...

77
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.792
Oh. my!

78
00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:37.196
Try harder.

79
00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:50.841
That's my apprentice. Trevor.
Don't mind him.

80
00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:52.042
He shows promise.

81
00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:56.881
But he's always wearing
those ridiculous hats.
No offense.

82
00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:57.815
Now. where were we?

83
00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:02.653
I'd like to see something
a little more scary.

84
00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:04.822
if you catch my drift.

85
00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:08.461
Of course. Step into my office.

86
00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:26.946
So. who told you about me?

87
00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.712
Olive Khadka.

88
00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:32.349
Ugh. Olive. such a shame.

89
00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.151
I deliver
state-of-the-art costumes.

90
00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:39.089
and these fools
end up getting defeated
by those...

91
00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:42.195
I appreciate the rec
nonetheless.

92
00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:44.595
Let me cut to the chase.

93
00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:45.796
I got the inside track

94
00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:48.966
that a new highway
is about to run
through Winterhaven.

95
00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:52.303
-And I--
-And you're looking to
buy up the land on the cheap

96
00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.838
so you can
make a monstrous profit.

97
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.444
But first. you need a way
to scare off the competition.

98
00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:03.247
Um. yeah. something like that.

99
00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:04.915
I have just the thing.

100
00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.319
Esteban.

101
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:20.466
Hmm. Looks a bit constricting.

102
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:27.571
I call it
the 10.000 Volt Ghost.

103
00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:29.707
The cloth conforms
to any body type.

104
00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:34.345
and you can adjust the current
to control the mind of anyone

105
00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.614
you want
to submit to your will.

106
00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:39.752
It's my greatest creation yet.

107
00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:44.922
How much?

108
00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:48.125
For you. it could be free...

109
00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:49.460
I'm listening.

110
00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:51.195
...on this one condition.

111
00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.963
Get rid of those meddling kids

112
00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:56.634
who've been destroying
all of my brilliant costumes.

113
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.837
And their dumb dog. too.

114
00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:04.141
That might be
a little difficult.

115
00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:06.010
Oh. And why is that?

116
00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:11.248
Because. like. I am
one of those meddling kids.

117
00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:15.319
And I am their dumb dog.

118
00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:18.157
Whoa!

119
00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:24.261
Nice work. Shaggy and Scooby.

120
00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:29.168
And as promised.
here are your Scooby...

121
00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:38.444
Jinkies!

122
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.613
You've just helped us
nab the mastermind

123
00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:47.084
of one of the most notorious
costume crime syndicates
in the world.

124
00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:48.452
The most notorious.

125
00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:49.920
But how did you kids do it?

126
00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.288
It's simple. really. Sheriff.

127
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.259
You see. I had a hunch
that a lot of the cases
we've been solving lately

128
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.260
were somehow connected.

129
00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.096
Scooby and Shaggy
bravely put themselves
in harm's way

130
00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.898
time after time
to gather clues.

131
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.102
While Velma.
our resident science whiz.
analyzed that data.

132
00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:07.371
which led us here
to Coco's factory.

133
00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:08.772
-Humph.
-And Daphne.

134
00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:12.142
well. she. uh... She. uh...

135
00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:14.144
Uh. what was it again?

136
00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:15.479
Fred. don't be silly.

137
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:19.283
You know very well
that I... I. um...

138
00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:22.620
Come to think of it.
I'm not really sure what I did.

139
00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.657
or what I ever do.

140
00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:28.425
I see. Well. good work.

141
00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:29.994
Yeah. yeah. Good work.

142
00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:33.597
But you know what they say
about too much of a good thing.

143
00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:35.766
Okay. time to go. Miss Diablo.

144
00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:41.774
Fire away. news monkeys!
All press is good press.

145
00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:47.444
Well. gang.
another mystery solved.

146
00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:48.846
And with Coco Diablo locked up.

147
00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:51.982
things should be
a whole lot quieter
from now on.

148
00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:54.551
Sounds groovy to me. man.

149
00:10:54.553 --> 00:10:56.789
Yeah. me too.

150
00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:03.996
But what if there really can be
too much of a good thing?

I'm pretty good with

174
00:13:34.113 --> 00:13:36.213
No. thanks. I've got a system.

175

are you hiding
in all of this. Mr. Humdrum?

178
00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:48.926
Oh. please be
a fleet of ghost pirates

179
00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:53.697
he wanted to use to scare
a small fishing village
into selling him their land.

180
00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:59.503
Oh! Or...
Or maybe let's just see
who you really are.

181
00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:00.971
Hey. what are you doing?

182
00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:03.240
No. stop. Stop that.

183
00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:06.543
Oh. that's my face.
I can...

184
00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:08.445
Oh! Get off...

185
00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:10.414
Get off of me!

186
00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:16.520
Oh. my eye. Aah! Oh!

187
00:14:17.289 --> 00:14:18.222
Sorry. Fred.

188
00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:20.190
he was inflating tax refunds
for his clients

189
00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:23.527
by claiming fake deductions.
exaggerating expenses.

190
00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:26.830
and falsifying home energy
improvement reports.

191
00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:28.332
But that's so boring.

192
00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:32.571
Take him away. Sheriff.
or whatever.

193
00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:33.537
Who cares.

194
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.372
Uh. not to add insult
to injury.

195
00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:40.544
but we don't really
take people away
for crimes like these.

196
00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:41.445
Now. Charlie.

197
00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:43.780
do you promise
to pay back
what you owe?

198
00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:47.019
Uh... Yes.

199
00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.889
Okay then. that's that.

200
00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:52.725
Hmph.

201
00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:02.067
Hey. who ate my lunch?

202
00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:11.008
You know. I'm starting to think
that maybe it was a mistake...

203
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.309
Don't say it. Fred.

204
00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:15.946
-Don't say it was a mistake
capturing Coco Diablo.
-Capturing Coco Diablo.

205
00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:17.014
Since we locked her up.

206
00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:19.349
we haven't had
one interesting case.

207
00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:23.954
But it's good
a criminal mastermind
is behind bars. right?

208
00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:25.589
Yeah.
good for her maybe.

209
00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:28.091
She's becoming a celebrity
in there.

210
00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:30.227
Her book was a best-seller.

211
00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:33.230
Velma. you bought a copy?

212
00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:34.264
Oh.

213
00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:35.732
I buy every bestselling book

214
00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:37.301
written by criminals
we put away.

215
00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:40.304
It's a helpful way
to get insight
into the criminal mind.

216
00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:43.273
And Coco's prose
is surprisingly poetic.

217
00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:45.108
Huh! A lot of good
that will do us.

218
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.945
solving mysteries
about missing socks.

219
00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:48.879
Dude. the way I see it.

220
00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:53.817
fewer freaky cases
means fewer freaky ghosts
freaking us out.

221
00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:54.584
Yeah!

222
00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:57.087
So. let's just enjoy
this downtime. man.

223
00:15:57.089 --> 00:16:00.090
I mean. dude.
tomorrow's Halloween!

224
00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:05.829

ringing the bell.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.473
We'll just use our foot
as leverage.

Ooh. a raggy roor.

244
00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:56.179

You thinking what I'm thinking?

257
00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:32.718
Let's suit up!

258
00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:44.227
-Yeah. these will work.
-Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

259
00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:50.100
Hey. looks like the gang
wants to get a head start
on trick-or-treating!

260
00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:52.602
Oh. boy.
Oh. boy. Oh. boy.

261
00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:54.838
After you. sir.

262
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.609
No. I insist.

263
00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:00.145
Aah!

264
00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:04.648
Happy Halloween!

265
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.485
Shaggy. Scooby. look. I know
you're excited for Halloween.

266
00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:11.755
but I've had it
with these rinky-dink cases.

267
00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.623
We need a real mystery.

268
00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:14.257
But how?

269
00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:15.926
And more importantly. why?

270
00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:18.495
I thought about it.
and I had a great idea.

271
00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:21.565
I say we take a page
out of Coco Diablo's book.

272
00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:25.237
and drum up
a little publicity of our own.

273
00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:27.104
Not today. though. right?

274
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.172
I mean. today's Halloween.

275
00:18:29.174 --> 00:18:32.111
Yeah. we're pumpkins.

276
00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:35.011
All right. guys. listen.
Just hear me out.

277
00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:35.979
What if we set up a booth

278
00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:38.615
at the Coolsville
Halloween Festival today?

279
00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:41.051
The exposure
could bring us new business.

280
00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:43.587
- Oh!
- That's your big idea?

281
00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:45.088
A booth at a festival?

282
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.525
What's our next case?
Judging the biggest hog?

283
00:18:50.062 --> 00:18:51.595
Well. that's not all.

284
00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:52.796
We could put out a guest book

285
00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.664
so people can leave
their contact information.

286
00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:58.235
or tell us
about mysterious occurrences
in their lives.

287
00:18:58.237 --> 00:19:01.004
But... but trick-or-treating!

288
00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.774
And candy!

289
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:08.211
-Everything okay. Fred?
-I. uh...

290
00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:11.216
I think I see my grandmother
over there.

291
00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:21.860
Hi. wishing well.

292
00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:25.962
Gee. I feel kind of silly

293
00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:28.800
talking to a hole
in the ground. but...

294
00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:34.673
I sure do wish
we had a creepy caper again.

295
00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:41.046
Well. here goes nothing.

296
00:19:46.084 --> 00:19:48.385
Like. I didn't know
Fred was so broken up
about this.

297
00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:54.090
Yeah. I never thought
he'd believe in something
as crazy as a wishing well.

298
00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:55.192
Must be pretty serious.

299
00:19:55.194 --> 00:20:00.030
Maybe it wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world
to try his idea.

300
00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.534
Here he comes.

301
00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:05.602
Sorry about that.

302
00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:07.871
It wasn't my grandma
after all.

303
00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:10.842
So now. where were we?

304
00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:14.044
What?

305
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.855
Now. like. just to be clear.

306
00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:29.693
the plan is
we work the festival
during the day.

307
00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:30.660
and then at sundown.

308
00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:33.597
-we all go out
trick-or-treating. right?
-Mm-hmm.

309
00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.631
Of course. Shaggy.

310
00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:37.567
Now. why don't you and Scooby
go work the crowd a little?

311
00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:40.804
See if you can
lead some customers
over here.

312
00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:41.705
And who's to say

313
00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:44.574
we don't find
some succulent snackage
as well!

314
00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:47.844
Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah!

315
00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:49.346
What can I do to help?

316
00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:50.213
Oh. uh...

317
00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:54.086
Why don't you
put the guest book
on the table?

318
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.888
Fine.

319
00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.226
I hope I can handle that.

320
00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:03.727
Oh. I guess I can.

321
00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:05.428
Oh. and maybe open it

322
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.063
so people are encouraged
to sign it.

323
00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:10.734
Got it. Fred.
It's not rocket science.

324
00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:15.572
Detectives here!
Anybody need a detective?

325
00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:17.409
Hey. Shaggy. look.

326
00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:23.313
Oh. boy. Oh. boy. Oh. boy.

327
00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:24.281
You know what?

328
00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.849
We've been working pretty hard.
Scooby-Doo.

329
00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:28.218
Like. it couldn't hurt
to stop for a healthy snack.
right?

330
00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.657
No. sir. Not at all.

331
00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:43.099
Why is no one
visiting our table?

332
00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:46.403
And just
how are we supposed
to compete with that?

333
00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:48.740
Oh.

334
00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:56.948
Three. two. one. bob!

335
00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:23.506
Was that what I think it was?

336
00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:25.410
It sure seemed like a...

337
00:22:25.977 --> 00:22:26.776
Ghost!

338
00:22:26.778 --> 00:22:28.011
We have to tell the gang.

339
00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:29.279
Hold on.

340
00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:33.616
This could. like.
seriously impede our chances
of trick-or-treating.

341
00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:36.555
Dude. let's say nothing.

342
00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:43.960
Hey. fellas.

343
00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:46.763
any luck
finding new mysteries for us
to solve?

344
00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:48.865
What? Oh. no. no.

345
00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:50.300
Not much going on. really.

346
00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:54.070
Definitely no ghouls or ghosts
lurking about.

347
00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:57.440
How have things been over here?

348
00:22:57.442 --> 00:22:59.976
Like. any big mysteries
come our way

349
00:22:59.978 --> 00:23:01.611
while we were gone?

350
00:23:01.613 --> 00:23:03.713
Uh. what's wrong with Scooby?

351
00:23:05.016 --> 00:23:06.449
My good bud. Scooby-Doo here.

352
00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:08.685
is just so excited
about Halloween

353
00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:10.754
he can hardly contain himself.

354
00:23:10.756 --> 00:23:13.757
Ix-nay on the ost-ghay.

355
00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:15.125
Man!

356
00:23:15.127 --> 00:23:17.627
We saw a-a-a ghost!

357
00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:20.132
Sorry. Shaggy.

358
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.800
Oh. I get it.

359
00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:25.602
You're just trying
to keep our hopes up

360
00:23:25.604 --> 00:23:27.637
because we're not getting
any bites.

361
00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:29.639
We'll just have to hunker down.

362
00:23:29.641 --> 00:23:30.573
If we stay put.

363
00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:36.079
I'm sure a new case
will show up
before... too... long.

364
00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:42.118
I'm here for you. Mystery Inc.

365
00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:45.955
Are you guys seeing this?

366
00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:48.258
Ah. my wish came true.

367
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.396
Uh-oh. Ahhh!

368
00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.337
My brochures! Our guest book!

369
00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:03.106
Fred. it's time to run!

370
00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:08.180
To the Mystery Machine!

371
00:24:09.714 --> 00:24:12.083
Never mind.

372
00:24:17.155 --> 00:24:21.458
If that ghoul is here for us.
I want to be somewhere else.

373
00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.128
Wowie! Looks like
we got our next mystery.

374
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.629
and this one's got teeth!

375
00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:30.433
- Good. 'cause I might need
a new set afterwards.

376
00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:31.534
As soon as possible.

377
00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:33.970
we'll need to round up
a list of potential suspects.

378
00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:35.738
beginning with Farmer Avery

379
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.842
and that suspicious goat
of his.

380
00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:40.343
And I'll cross reference
that list

381
00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:43.179
with any recent land deals
in the area.

382
00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:44.347
Great thinking. Velma.

383
00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:47.684
No. wait. A ghost with a grudge
attacking us on Halloween.

384
00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:50.019
There's only one person
who could be behind this.

385
00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:55.458
I think
it's time we pay a visit
to our old pal Coco Diablo.

386
00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.696
I love that idea!

387
00:24:58.063 --> 00:25:00.763
I mean. you know.
it's. um. hmm...

388
00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:03.833
It's completely.
logically sound.

389
00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:06.035
-I like it. too.
-Really?

390
00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:07.403
But there's no time to lose.

391
00:25:07.405 --> 00:25:09.339
Because. like.
we gotta solve this case

392
00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:12.878
in time to go
trick-or-treating. right?

393
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:28.725
Before I show you even more
of the high tech modifications

394
00:25:28.727 --> 00:25:30.493
I've made to the facility.

395
00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:31.494
I just want to say

396
00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:34.297
what a tremendous honor it is
to welcome you here.

397
00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:36.065
I'm a huge fan of Mystery Inc.

398
00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:38.067
Yeah. man.
you already said that.

399
00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:39.702
Three times already.

400
00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:40.937
Well. I can't say it enough.

401
00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:45.341
given how your mystery solving
has kept my prison
at full capacity

402
00:25:45.343 --> 00:25:46.978
over the years.

403
00:25:51.983 --> 00:25:54.386
You meddling kids!

404
00:25:57.889 --> 00:26:00.523
Try not to let
any of these goons upset you.

405
00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:04.627
Mystery Inc?
More like mystery stink.

406
00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:08.197
Shut your trap!

407
00:26:08.199 --> 00:26:10.099
How dare you
disrespect my friends
like that.

408
00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:11.067
you filthy crook!

409
00:26:12.203 --> 00:26:16.708
It's okay. Warden Collins.
Wasn't even a very good burn.

410
00:26:19.177 --> 00:26:20.812
I'll show them.

411
00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:23.315
I'll show them all.

412
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.488
Oh!

413
00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:34.791
What are you doing. man?

414
00:26:34.793 --> 00:26:37.462
Don't worry. Watch.

415
00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:43.802
I'm free!

416
00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:50.239
Watch the pretty coin of gold.

417
00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:53.411
and you will do
as you are told.

418
00:26:59.584 --> 00:27:01.017
Invisible force field.

419
00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:04.621
I designed it myself.
Gets them every time.

420
00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:05.855
Oh. you got to let me show you

421
00:27:05.857 --> 00:27:07.957
our new state-of-the-art
robotic chef.

422
00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:10.927
You just have to see this thing
flip pancakes!

423
00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:15.331
Raggy. did he just say
pancakes?

424
00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:22.171
Wait. wait. wait! No!
Like. keep it together. buddy.

425
00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:25.875
We need to stay focused.
Remember. time is candy.

426
00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:29.614
Oh. right. Candy.
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!

427
00:27:30.615 --> 00:27:32.949
I'm cool. Tell him. Shaggy.

428
00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:34.017
Never thought I'd say this.

429
00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:37.453
but. man. there's no time
for pancakes today.

430
00:27:37.455 --> 00:27:39.122
As fun as this tour has been.

431
00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:42.060
we're here
to talk to Coco Diablo.

432
00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:47.330
Oh. of course.

433
00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:50.900
You kids.
such professionals.

434
00:27:50.902 --> 00:27:52.437
Right this way.

435
00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:58.574
Anyhoo. you're lucky
you caught Miss Diablo on a day

436
00:27:58.576 --> 00:28:02.480
where she doesn't have
too many press events planned.

437
00:28:04.883 --> 00:28:07.719
Uh...

438
00:28:14.893 --> 00:28:16.959
I don't mean to be rude. dude.

439
00:28:16.961 --> 00:28:19.495
but we're on
a bit of a schedule here.

440
00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:23.533
No. no. I got it.

441
00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:25.270
Just give me a sec.

442
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.683
You have four minutes.

443
00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:44.887
Oh. heck. since it's you.
take as long as you need.

444
00:28:56.601 --> 00:29:01.673
Well. well. well.
Look who it is.

445
00:29:04.442 --> 00:29:05.910
Jinkies!

446
00:29:06.277 --> 00:29:08.711
You don't seem surprised
to see us.

447
00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:10.313
Word travels fast in here.

448
00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:14.250
Heard you're having
a bit of a ghoul problem.

449
00:29:15.053 --> 00:29:17.320
Hmm. you sure do know a lot

450
00:29:17.322 --> 00:29:19.255
for someone
who's been locked away.

451
00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:20.389
You were behind the attack!

452
00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:23.126
Case closed.
Let's get out of here. guys.

453
00:29:24.395 --> 00:29:27.563
What makes you think
I had anything to do with it?

454
00:29:27.565 --> 00:29:28.898
Do you really expect us
to believe

455
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:32.368
that the mastermind behind
all our previous mysteries

456
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:33.970
had nothing to do
with this one?

457
00:29:33.972 --> 00:29:35.972
Did you see
any of my signature designs?

458
00:29:35.974 --> 00:29:38.474
What mechanisms
did they use to attack you?

459
00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:42.211
Did the ghoul's clothes
have built-in pockets?

460
00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:44.180
Details matter.

461
00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:45.014
Hmm.

462
00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:47.583
Now that you mention it.
we were kind of distracted
by being--

463
00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:50.019
Terrified! His face was like...

464
00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:53.589
And he. uh...
So we were like. "Ruh-roh!"

465
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:55.158
Normally.
I'm much more observant.

466
00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.495
There was a lot happening
at once.

467
00:29:58.096 --> 00:30:00.062
Too bad. If I had been there.

468
00:30:00.064 --> 00:30:01.564
I bet
I could have narrowed it down

469
00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:05.201
to two or three copycats
of my work.

470
00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:06.869
Wait a second. That's it!

471
00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:08.871
Maybe you could help us
crack the case.

472
00:30:08.873 --> 00:30:11.007
Sure. it'll be a tight squeeze
in the van.

473
00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:13.311
but nothing we can't handle.

474
00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:14.877
Right?

475
00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:16.913
Actually.
that's not a bad idea.

476
00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:20.850
After all. Coco is well-versed
in the minds of criminals.

477
00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:22.318
Whoa. whoa. whoa. hang on.

478
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:27.390
We need to carefully
and meticulously consider this.

479
00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:29.859
Oh. boy. how long is this
going to take?

480
00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:32.628
Working with the enemy
on our first case in a year

481
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:36.401
seems like
a recipe for disaster.

482
00:30:36.734 --> 00:30:38.034
Huh...

483
00:30:38.036 --> 00:30:39.370
But?

484
00:30:39.737 --> 00:30:40.837
But at the same time.

485
00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:44.774
we haven't had a case
like this in some time.

486
00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:47.243
and we could be a little rusty.

487
00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:50.181
A little help might be...

488
00:30:50.748 --> 00:30:54.517
-Just say it already!
-This is taking forever!

489
00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:59.822
...something to carefully
and meticulously consider.

490
00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:05.595
Look. the only way
I'll agree to help

491
00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:09.699
is if I could be considered
for early release.

492
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:10.900
You know. for a good behavior.

493
00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:15.538
And helping Mystery Inc.
would definitely qualify
as good behavior.

494
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.609
But I'm just not sure
Coco can be trusted.

495
00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:20.576
Look. Fred.

496
00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:22.812
we need Coco's insights
to help identify these ghouls.

497
00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:25.848
and she needs us
to vouch for her early release.

498
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:27.617
That's trust enough for me.

499
00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:29.118
What do you think.
Warden Collins?

500
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.588
Well. it's pretty risky
for obvious reasons.

501
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.991
But if you teenagers think
it's okay.

502
00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:36.425
who am I to argue?

503
00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:39.362
But if you're leaving
the premises.

504
00:31:39.364 --> 00:31:40.963
I need a safeguard.

505
00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:42.265
If Coco strays out of range.

506
00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:44.100
the necessary parties
will be alerted.

507
00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:47.536
We just need one of you kids
to wear the matching bracelet

508
00:31:47.538 --> 00:31:49.672
and serve as home base.
if you will.

509
00:31:49.674 --> 00:31:51.042
I'll do it!

510
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:56.748
What? I'm curious to see
how the technology works.

511
00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:03.452
You kids have fun.

512
00:32:03.454 --> 00:32:07.857
Scoob. we absotively posilutely
have to speed things up here.

513
00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:08.991
We've got to crack this case

514
00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:10.960
before Coco and her big ideas
slow us down.

515
00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:14.899
The clock's ticking!
Scoob. are you listening?

516
00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:18.636
Scooby-Doo?

517
00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:30.713
Esteban!

518
00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:34.986
My angel of darkness!

519
00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:41.025
Ahem. I mean. my angel.

520
00:32:47.498 --> 00:32:50.366
Now. Coco.
if we're gonna make this work.

521
00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:51.467
you play by our rules

522
00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:56.072
and don't do anything
to distract from
or jeopardize this case.

523
00:32:56.074 --> 00:32:59.477
Or our plans to go
trick-or-treating tonight.

524
00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:06.849
So. what do you think
about bringing Coco along?

525
00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:10.286
Oh. is she coming with us?
I hadn't noticed.

526
00:33:10.288 --> 00:33:11.454
Yeah. it's just weird.

527
00:33:11.456 --> 00:33:13.956
'cause I didn't know
convicted felons
were your type.

528
00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:17.927
What?
Type? Me? Please.

529
00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:20.196
Who has time for a... a type?

530
00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:21.964
We have our work
cut out for us.

531
00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:25.501
and I am focused
like a laser on...

532
00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:26.836
Okay.
who am I kidding!

533
00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:31.941
I'm crushing big time. Daphne!
What do I do? What do I say?

534
00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:34.910
Don't overthink it.
Just be yourself.

535
00:33:34.912 --> 00:33:38.683
Oh. yeah. Easy peasy.

536
00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:47.225
Hmm. So this is where
the magic happens.

537
00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:52.628
You guys
really do need help
if you're driving this.

538
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.196
The Mystery Machine
took a big hit.

539
00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:58.134
but she's still got
what it takes
to get the job done.

540
00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.239
Just like us.

541
00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:08.444
Like. maybe we should
take a different car
or a bus or something.

542
00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:13.049
Are you crazy?
This is the Mystery Machine.

543
00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:13.716
Oh. man!

544
00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:15.284
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

545
00:34:15.286 --> 00:34:18.487
Come on. old girl.
Fred needs a new ascot.

546
00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.830
Boy. listen to that baby purr.

547
00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:29.331
So. where are we headed. gang?

548
00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:31.700
Let's take Coco
to the scene of the crime.

549
00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:32.935
She might have some insights.

550
00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:35.271
Hey.
now is your chance
to talk to her.

551
00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:39.475
So. uh. what made you
get into the business
of being bad?

552
00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:42.344
I mean. not that
there is anything wrong
with being bad.

553
00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:44.480
Wait. Oh. no.
that didn't come out right.

554
00:34:44.482 --> 00:34:46.682
Good and bad are subjective.

555
00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:51.620
I don't see why innovation
and helping people
solve their problems

556
00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:53.089
would be considered bad.

557
00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:54.123
You are so right.

558
00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:56.725
You know.
one time I got detention--

559
00:34:56.727 --> 00:34:58.160
Hi. Sorry to steal
my friend here.

560
00:34:58.162 --> 00:35:02.533
but I need to talk to her
about anything but this.

561
00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:05.034
Okay. you're doing great.

562
00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:07.438
-I am?
-No.

563
00:35:16.914 --> 00:35:19.984
Fred. how long
till we are there?

564
00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:23.486
Uh. approximately one hour.

565
00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:28.023
I guess we can kiss
all that sweet. sweet candy
goodbye.

566
00:35:28.025 --> 00:35:31.562
There's always
next year.

567
00:35:36.234 --> 00:35:37.833
Let me
set the stage for you. Coco.

568
00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:42.571
Imagine an amazing
attention-grabbing booth
right here.

569
00:35:42.573 --> 00:35:43.839
Why would I imagine that?

570
00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:47.645
Fred thought
it would be a great way
to drum up business.

571
00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:56.252
That was my reaction. too.

572
00:35:57.221 --> 00:35:59.388
Excuse me.
I'm setting the stage here.

573
00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.457
Anyway. there was a line
of potential clients

574
00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:03.259
that stretched
all the way from here

575
00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:06.195
- to the very unpopular
goat-balancing act.
- Hmm.

576
00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:11.000
- Sky seemed to change colors
and the air smelled like...

577
00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:12.935
-Kettle corn!
-BRB.

578
00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:15.371
No. it...
it wasn't kettle corn.

579
00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:18.307
- It was like. um. more of a--
- Propylene.

580
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.476
Judging by the trace amounts
of propylene glycol.

581
00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:24.580
whoever's behind this
clearly lacks imagination.

582
00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:28.150
So. we can assume
their techniques
will be primitive.

583
00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:31.654
And since ethereal torpedoes
don't actually exist.

584
00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:34.390
we're looking for
some kind of detonation device

585
00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:38.529
that was triggered
via remote control.

586
00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:41.597
Swoon.

587
00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.732
Oh. yeah. sure.
We already know all of that.

588
00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:46.969
Look. making monsters
may be your life's work.

589
00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.437
but catching them is ours.

590
00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:51.173
So. if you'll please
just trust our process.

591
00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:54.745
-Now. uh. where was I?
-Hold that thought.

592
00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:56.712
What is this?

593
00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:57.980
Oh. that's just our guest book

594
00:36:57.982 --> 00:37:01.116
for people to sign
and write down the mysteries

595
00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:03.020
they need solved.

596
00:37:07.458 --> 00:37:08.290
Hmm.

597
00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:10.226
You'd think
we would have noticed
something like that.

598
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:12.428
-Does that name
sound familiar to you?
-No.

599
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:16.665
Whoever it is.
this Nefario is our next clue.

600
00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:18.701
We are back. What did we miss?

601
00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:21.005
Did you guys solve the case?

602
00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:28.010
When I said
we should look into
who this Nefario guy is.

603
00:37:28.012 --> 00:37:30.379
this isn't what I meant.

604
00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:32.982
You sure do love
boring homework.

605
00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:35.384
Pfft. Not me. I hate homework.

606
00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:38.554
Never done a day of it
in my life.

607
00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:45.894
Or have I? Who can say?
Because I am very mysterious.

608
00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:51.533
Ah. here it is.

609
00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:55.573
The "Life and Crimes
of Friederich Nefario."

610
00:37:57.942 --> 00:37:59.541
Oh.

611
00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:00.609
"Deep in his castle

612
00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:02.144
high in the
Carpathian Mountains.

613
00:38:02.146 --> 00:38:06.615
Count Friederich Nefario
gathered members
of high society

614
00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:07.483
from across Europe

615
00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:10.586
to form a council
with a sinister purpose.

616
00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:11.654
He called them together

617
00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:13.922
because they were each
uniquely suited

618
00:38:13.924 --> 00:38:16.091
to carry out his grand plan.

619
00:38:16.093 --> 00:38:17.926
There was
his dear friend. Daisy.

620
00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:19.962
a vain and spoiled socialite

621
00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:22.731
who had everything
but it was never enough.

622
00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:25.834
And Helga.
a scientific genius
who knew it all.

623
00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:28.871
All but the difference
between right and wrong.
that is.

624
00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:33.642
And finally. Craggly
and his trusted attack dog.
Rudy.

625
00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:34.910
whose insatiable appetites

626
00:38:34.912 --> 00:38:37.615
often led them
down the wrong path.

627
00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:41.483
And so.
on this fateful
Halloween night.

628
00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:44.286
Nefario opened
the ancient tome and--"

629
00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:46.123
Wait a second.

630
00:38:46.957 --> 00:38:47.890
Is it just me.

631
00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:51.627
or is there something
strangely familiar
about this group?

632
00:38:51.629 --> 00:38:52.461
I don't see it.

633
00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:54.496
Can we please
get back to reading?

634
00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:56.498
Yeah. the clock's ticking.

635
00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:01.070
"Nefario opened
the ancient tome
and read from the sacred text.

636
00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:04.807
inviting them to join
the most enticing fellowship

637
00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:07.743
called Misery Company."

638
00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:09.778
"Upon initiation.

639
00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.881
they would receive
the gift of eternal life.

640
00:39:12.883 --> 00:39:14.883
not only outliving
their children.

641
00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:16.852
but also
their children's children

642
00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:18.487
and their children's
children's children

643
00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:22.891
-and their children's
children's children's--"
-Man. I can't take it anymore!

644
00:39:22.893 --> 00:39:23.659
Let's see here.

645
00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:26.795
"According to legend..."
blah. blah. blah.

646
00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:27.696
Aha. here it is.

647
00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:30.165
"Misery Company
got to live forever.

648
00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:31.567
But in return. they were forced

649
00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:34.670
to maintain the balance
of good and evil in the world."

650
00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:36.605
So. like.
if there was too much good.

651
00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:38.907
they had to balance it out
with evil.

652
00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:41.510
Then blah. blah.
blah. blah. blah. Boom.

653
00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:44.680
The end.
That's the clue! Move on!

654
00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:45.514
Shh!

655
00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:49.685
Need I remind you
that you are in a library?

656
00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:51.255
No!

657
00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:55.824
But why would
this Misery Company
be coming after us?

658
00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:56.925
It's obvious.

659
00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:58.927
You goody-goodies
disrupted the balance.

660
00:39:58.929 --> 00:40:02.531
You caused there
to be too much good
in the world.

661
00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:04.266
especially after catching me.

662
00:40:04.268 --> 00:40:08.637
Now the ghouls are after you
to set the balance right again.

663
00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:09.938
So. if I were you.

664
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.611
I'd keep an eye out
for this Nefario guy.

665
00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:17.613
He's right behind me. isn't he?

666
00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:19.383
Mm-hmm.

667
00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:23.454
No wires. huh?

668
00:40:24.054 --> 00:40:27.189
Can't wait to talk shop
with whoever you are

669
00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:28.123
when this is over.

670
00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:31.427

miniaturize the turbo pump

698
00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:46.995
for the actuators?

699
00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:48.096
I'm impressed.

700
00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:49.464
Oh. that was easy.

701
00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:50.799
The hard part
was getting comfortable

702
00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:54.336
carrying rocket fuel and parts
around all day unnoticed.

703
00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:56.538
Wow. I'm being myself.

704
00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.472
Look out!

705
00:42:57.474 --> 00:43:01.645
- I hate coming to the library
to do my homework.

706
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:07.082
Awesome!

707
00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:11.622
Now I have an excuse
to not do my homework!

708
00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:14.990
Like. what are we gonna do?

709
00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:19.194
Okay. gang. ahh.
this is just like old times.

710
00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:20.062
Here's the plan.

711
00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:22.598
- Let's split up and--
- We just did that!

712
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.700
Shh.

713
00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:25.968
This is all very disruptive.

714
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:27.869
I could have you banned.
you know?

715
00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:29.573
We know.

716
00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:33.775
So. does anyone else
have a plan?

717
00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:37.946
I think we're overdue
for some good ideas.

718
00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:40.582
Oh! Library puns.

719
00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:42.484
I've got an idea.

720
00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:44.455
Yo. ghoul breath!

721
00:43:47.424 --> 00:43:49.159
Follow my lead.

722
00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:55.466
We're here for you!

723
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.666
You know.

724
00:43:57.668 --> 00:43:59.534
I expect this kind of thing
from kids these days.

725
00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:04.339
but someone as ancient as you
should really know better.

726
00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:06.308
You should respect the rules!

727
00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:07.843
You should respect authority!

728
00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:11.647
You should respect the fact
that this is a library.

729
00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:17.454
and in the library.
you be quiet!

730
00:44:18.555 --> 00:44:20.190
Quick. this way.

731
00:44:24.962 --> 00:44:28.397
Oh.
some help here. please.

732
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.371
And don't you ever
let me catch you
being loud again.

733
00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:41.879
We are here for you!

734
00:44:42.146 --> 00:44:43.745
Shaggy. it's just a costume.

735
00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:45.914
You're gonna need
to leave it behind.

736
00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:46.982
No. I can't do that.

737
00:44:46.984 --> 00:44:48.717
I can't trick-or-treat
without a costume.

738
00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:51.987
And I can't get all that candy
unless we trick-or-treat.

739
00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:55.857
One of the great paradoxes
of the universe.

740
00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:05.834
Like. dude.
that was a lot of fun
and everything.

741
00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:09.538
But I don't think
we're any closer
to solving this case!

742
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.039
Yeah. or trick-or-treating.

743
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:14.309
And now. instead of one ghoul.
we've got five after us!

744
00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:18.782
What kind of dangerous road
are you leading us down. Coco?

745
00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:24.653
I'm sure that
Coco made some
brilliant observations

746
00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:26.488
in the encounter we just had.

747
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.090
The cute one's right.

748
00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:32.060
Esteban. show them
my brilliant observations.

749
00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:37.299
Black lace. Platform boots.
Tacky cloak. Top hat.

750
00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:41.205
I know who is behind this.

751
00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:45.876
And I know
just where to find him.

752
00:46:30.788 --> 00:46:32.654
Oh. my! A customer!

753
00:46:32.656 --> 00:46:35.023
But what do I do?
What do I say?

754
00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:40.295
Just be yourself. Trevor.
Your dark and beautiful self.

755
00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:48.270
Greetings. seeker of darkness.

756
00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:53.477
and welcome to Trevor Glume's
Boutique of...

757
00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:55.644
Hello. Trevor.

758
00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:57.012
...Doom.

759
00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:04.252
My. my!
Look how far you've come.

760
00:47:04.254 --> 00:47:07.756
I'm so proud of you.

761
00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:09.291
Hello. Miss Diablo.

762
00:47:09.293 --> 00:47:12.961
Yes. A lot has changed
since you were...

763
00:47:12.963 --> 00:47:14.629
Well...

764
00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:17.901
Excuse me! Those are not food!

765
00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:25.507
Anyway. I finally
had the emotional space

766
00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:28.510
to pursue
my own personal style.

767
00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:31.982
Your own
personal style?

768
00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:36.687
Just looks like
more Dracula costumes
to me. Trevor.

769
00:47:38.822 --> 00:47:41.890
Admit it! You're trying
to steal my old business model

770
00:47:41.892 --> 00:47:45.293
while I was locked away.
unable to fend for myself!

771
00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:47.162
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

772
00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:52.903
I'm talking about
how you've been conspiring
to destroy Mystery Inc!

773
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:56.171
What?

774
00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:58.006
Where were you an hour ago?

775
00:47:58.008 --> 00:47:58.940
I was here

776
00:47:58.942 --> 00:48:02.210
dealing with my multitudes
of satisfied customers.

777
00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:05.883
I was very busy up
until the moment you came in.

778
00:48:07.584 --> 00:48:10.187
Would you mind proving that?

779
00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:12.287
I don't think that's necessary.

780
00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:15.893
What does security footage
really prove anyway?

781
00:48:19.596 --> 00:48:21.031
Rewind it.

782
00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:25.533
Rewind it more.

783
00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:31.408
Rewind it a lot more.

784
00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:35.911
Keep going.

785
00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:38.680
A little more.

786
00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:40.918
More.

787
00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:42.886
Stop. Go back.

788
00:48:44.454 --> 00:48:45.956
Enhance image.

789
00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:49.626
Enhance more.

790
00:48:54.998 --> 00:48:59.100
Well. it's sad.
but it is an alibi.

791
00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:06.741
Looks like--

792
00:49:06.743 --> 00:49:08.543
- Looks like...
- Sorry.

793
00:49:08.545 --> 00:49:10.378
Looks like we've hit
another dead end.

794
00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:14.950
So much for that
early release. Coco.

795
00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:15.750
Oh. come on.

796
00:49:15.752 --> 00:49:16.851
Can you blame me for thinking

797
00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:19.387
this tacky weirdo
designed those ghoul costumes?

798
00:49:19.389 --> 00:49:22.657
Maybe you'll get
some real customers

799
00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:25.560
if you got some actual taste.

800
00:49:25.562 --> 00:49:27.595
I do have real customers.

801
00:49:27.597 --> 00:49:30.167
In fact.

802
00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:36.571
you should know
that I received
the biggest order of my life

803
00:49:36.573 --> 00:49:37.639
just last week.

804
00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:40.375
Oh. sure. With who?

805
00:49:40.377 --> 00:49:41.743
Goths 'R Us?

806
00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:43.244
No. that was two weeks ago.

807
00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:46.848
Last week. I sent
some of my finest
Victorian creations

808
00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:50.085
- directly
to Coolsville Penitentiary.

809
00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:53.256
Coolsville Penitentiary?

810
00:49:53.757 --> 00:49:56.091
What are you looking at me for?

811
00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:56.992
Mr. Glume.

812
00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:58.560
could we see the paperwork
for that order?

813
00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:01.999
This is just the connection
we've been looking for.

814
00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:07.469
Looks like
Coco might be giving us
the runaround after all.

815
00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:09.004
Trevor fulfilled a big order

816
00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:10.805
for someone
at the prison last week.

817
00:50:10.807 --> 00:50:14.209
And Coco just so happened to be
at the prison last week.

818
00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:16.578
I'm sure
it's just a misunderstanding.

819
00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.614
Man. it's Coco.
Just like I said hours ago.

820
00:50:19.616 --> 00:50:22.219
Now. can we please
wrap this up?

821
00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.553
Ugh. what happened
to these receipts?

822
00:50:25.555 --> 00:50:27.088
They're all smudged.

823
00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:31.094
Haven't any of you
ever cried at work?

824
00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:33.695
Oh. Hey. don't worry.

825
00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:34.896
That's okay. buddy.

826
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:42.737
Hey. where did Coco go?

827
00:50:42.739 --> 00:50:47.776
Okay. it's starting to look
less like a misunderstanding.

828
00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:51.346
Oh. man. we still
haven't solved the case.

829
00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:54.616
and now we've got to find
an escaped convict. too?

830
00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:57.554
Worst Halloween ever!

831
00:50:59.823 --> 00:51:01.725
Oh. no. Look!

832
00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:03.158
I think it's time

833
00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:07.164
we go and investigate
the old Diablo costume factory.

834
00:51:07.597 --> 00:51:08.263
Wait a second.

835
00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:10.498
Oh. for the love
of Scooby Snacks.
what now?

836
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:13.935
If we're gonna do this right.
we got to do it in style.

837
00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:16.337
This is the awesome
montage part of the case

838
00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:19.174
where we spruce up
the Mystery Machine.

839
00:51:21.378 --> 00:51:22.377
Can I help?

840
00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:25.115
I don't know.

841
00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:28.450
Oh. why not?

842
00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:30.887

it's exactly what I expected.

866
00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:34.275
It is my greatest creation yet.

867
00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:54.431
Farewell.

868
00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:41.309
I suspect
Coco tried to throw us
off her tracks

869
00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:42.944
by accusing Trevor Glume.

870
00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:45.346
And when that backfired.
she lured us here

871
00:54:45.348 --> 00:54:47.382
so she could ambush us
at her factory.

872
00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:49.150
Where she has the upper hand.

873
00:54:49.152 --> 00:54:52.555
Coco has all her old
secret weapons here.

874
00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.292
We have to stay on our toes.

875
00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:13.243
Creepy.

876
00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:25.722
Oh!

877
00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:30.992
Like. really creepy.

878
00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:35.565
Don't worry.
Shaggy and Scooby.
it's only mannequins.

879
00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:40.401
Like. dude.
totally knew that.

880
00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:41.336
Yeah.

881
00:55:41.338 --> 00:55:43.738
we were just practicing
for the real ghouls.

882
00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.239
Who are probably close by.

883
00:55:45.241 --> 00:55:48.276
Maybe we should split up
and look for clues.

884
00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:49.644
Really? You mean it?

885
00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:52.747
Dude. whatever keeps us moving.

886
00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:03.159
No question about it. guys.
we have to split up.

887
00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:06.427
Got any aces?

888
00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:08.463
No.
you took all of them.

889
00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:09.731
Wait. do you hear that?

890
00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:13.634
You're supposed
to say. "Go fish."

891
00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:14.969
That sounds like...

892
00:56:14.971 --> 00:56:16.804
It was implied.

893
00:56:16.806 --> 00:56:18.074
Us!

894
00:56:18.641 --> 00:56:20.508
Do you have any Jacks?

895
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.746
Go fish.

896
00:56:24.681 --> 00:56:26.214
I think you're cheating!

897
00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:30.420
What kind of fool
needs to cheat at Go Fish?

898
00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:32.088
Hmm.

899
00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:38.259
We might not be
able to trick tonight.

900
00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:41.364
but maybe we can still treat!

901
00:56:46.803 --> 00:56:48.503
-Oh!
-No!

902
00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:50.271
No. no. no. no!

903
00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:51.205
Just our luck!

904
00:56:51.207 --> 00:56:55.643
Why would I even need to cheat?
You have a terrible hand.

905
00:56:55.645 --> 00:56:56.444
I do?

906
00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:59.280
You're just jealous
because I'm the pretty one.

907
00:56:59.282 --> 00:57:01.482
Looked in the mirror lately?

908
00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:03.985
Silence. you fools!

909
00:57:03.987 --> 00:57:09.056
Time is upon us
to ambush those meddling kids.

910
00:57:09.058 --> 00:57:10.224
Oh. no. what should we do?

911
00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:14.228
Let's see. We already split up
and looked for clues. so...

912
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.731
Okay. here's the plan.
We need to--

913
00:57:19.869 --> 00:57:21.169
Run!

914
00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:26.075
We are here for you!

915
00:57:39.322 --> 00:57:40.221
Huh?

916
00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:51.399
Whoa!

917
00:58:06.783 --> 00:58:08.017
Whoa!

918
00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:26.601
I always knew
I was the complete package.

919
00:58:26.603 --> 00:58:28.703
but this is ridiculous.

920
00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:29.704
Help!

921
00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:31.439
Somebody help us!

922
00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:32.709
Help!

923
00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:40.047
Help! Anybody!

924
00:58:40.049 --> 00:58:43.217
Zoinks! Like. is that
what I'm think it is. Scoob?

925
00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:45.119
Help us!

926
00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:46.387
Please help us!

927
00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:49.323
-Anybody help us!
-Yeah. it is.

928
00:58:49.325 --> 00:58:50.727
What do we do?

929
00:58:54.464 --> 00:58:55.496
Mm-hmm.

930
00:58:55.498 --> 00:58:59.800
We got to do the one thing
that we don't want to do.

931
00:58:59.802 --> 00:59:00.501
Oh. no.

932
00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:02.570
By giving up
doing the one thing

933
00:59:02.572 --> 00:59:04.405
that we do want to do.

934
00:59:04.407 --> 00:59:05.406
You mean...

935
00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:06.709
I do!

936
00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:09.343
Hey. ghouls.

937
00:59:09.345 --> 00:59:11.145
don't forget about me
and Scooby-Doo.

938
00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:15.016
Yeah. This whole franchise
is named after me.

939
00:59:21.024 --> 00:59:24.458
We are here for you!

940
00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:27.662
Oh. sorry.
Thought you were somebody else.

941
00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:30.033
So long trick-or-treating.

942
00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:42.712
I guess we'll never know
who those ghouls really were.

943
00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:48.816
Robots?

944
00:59:48.818 --> 00:59:51.888
We're here for...

945
00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:55.790
So if the ghouls were robots.

946
00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:58.359
that means
someone was controlling them.

947
00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:00.595
And I'm pretty sure it was--

948
01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:01.931
Me.

949
01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:10.037
That's right. I did it all.

950
01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.505
I built the robots

951
01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:14.842
and programmed them
to get back at you

952
01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:17.178
for taking me down.

953
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.481
Huh?

954
01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:23.217
Oh. oh. and I would have
gotten away with it. too.

955
01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:27.788
if it wasn't
for you meddling kids.

956
01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:30.093
Hmm.

957
01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.931
Hmm.

958
01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:38.167
Hmm.

959
01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:42.271
Hmm.

960
01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.273
Even though I suspected
you were behind it

961
01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:47.141
the whole time.

962
01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:49.944
something about this
doesn't feel right.

963
01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:53.080
Agreed.
Seems a little too easy.

964
01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:54.115
And this confession

965
01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:57.987
doesn't seem
like your style. Coco.

966
01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:01.489
And where is Esteban?

967
01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.524
Hmm.

968
01:01:03.526 --> 01:01:04.291
Hmm.

969
01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:07.864
Like. hey. I think
Scooby's on to something.

970
01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:09.664
What is it. Scooby?

971
01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.601
Come on. let's follow him.

972
01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:39.493
Esteban is in here.

973
01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:42.265
No! Don't look in there.
please!

974
01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:44.932
And someone else. too.

975
01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:46.869
Oh. boy. Oh. boy.

976
01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:48.269
I bet whoever that is

977
01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:51.174
is the one
who's really behind this.

978
01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:56.310
But. uh. just to be clear.

979
01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:59.380
when we open this door.
we'll be done with the case.

980
01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:02.817
and who knows
when the next one might--

981
01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:05.488
- Open it. Fred.
- You bet.

982
01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:16.530
Warden Collins!

983
01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:18.668
Hi. Mystery Inc.

984
01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:25.072
So. it was Warden Collins
behind this assault
on Mystery Inc. the whole time?

985
01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:27.875
Only the Warden
is technologically savvy enough

986
01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.710
to program robots
this advanced.

987
01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:32.012
And. like. obsessed
with Mystery Inc. enough

988
01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:33.247
to make them look just like us.

989
01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:36.917
And only the Warden
had the ability to free Coco

990
01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.853
from her tracking bracelet.

991
01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:39.854
He brought her here.

992
01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:42.923
then took her adorable
kitty cat hostage...

993
01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:43.924
Not that adorable.

994
01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:46.861
...in order
to force a confession
out of her.

995
01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:47.561
But why?

996
01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:50.064
You kids may not know this.
but I'm your biggest fan.

997
01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:53.300
You've given me
ten times as many inmates
for my prison

998
01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:55.269
than the Coolsville
Police Department.

999
01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:58.506
Hey. now that's cold. but true.

1000
01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:01.575
But after putting away
Coco Diablo.

1001
01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:04.147
all your cases dried up.

1002
01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:07.548
And when I saw
how desperate you all were

1003
01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.250
for an exciting new mystery.

1004
01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:13.556
I just wanted to do something
to repay the favor.

1005
01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:14.889
I wanted to give you

1006
01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:18.793
the most exciting mystery
of your young lives.

1007
01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.862
I used the technology
I perfected at my prison

1008
01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:26.033
to construct
the scariest ghouls
I could imagine.

1009
01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:29.937
Evil doppelgangers
of my heroes!

1010
01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:34.510
Then I carefully
planted clues all over town.

1011
01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.787
And when
Coco Diablo got involved.

1012
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:49.723
I knew that
she would be the perfect dupe

1013
01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:50.658
to pin it all on

1014
01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.661
because she was already
serving hard time.

1015
01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.930
No harm. no foul.

1016
01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:02.269
So. this was all
just a big favor for us?

1017
01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:03.304
Mm-hmm.

1018
01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:07.174
Maybe there really can be
too much of a good thing.

1019
01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:09.643
But you were never
in any real danger

1020
01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:13.314
because I could always
turn off my evil robots

1021
01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:14.715
with a push of the button.

1022
01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:16.851
Oops.

1023
01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:22.391
That one deactivates
all the security force fields
at the prison.

1024
01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:24.758
Well. turn it back on!

1025
01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.560
Right. Of course.

1026
01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:30.066
Uh. wait. wait.
Which one was that again?

1027
01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:32.401
Uh... Wait. wait. wait. Uh...

1028
01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:35.071
Oops.

1029
01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:39.373
What's this now?

1030
01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:43.045
Another one
of the warden's tricks?

1031
01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.983
It's a Halloween miracle!

1032
01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:52.419
We're free. Free!

1033
01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:55.458
Free!

1034
01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:11.805
I think
"oops" is the wrong word.
Warden.

1035
01:05:11.807 --> 01:05:14.775
I know.
but this is a family movie.

1036
01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:15.676
All right. gang.

1037
01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:19.179
it looks like our work
isn't even close to done.

1038
01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:22.816
Maybe you should try
not to look so happy.

1039
01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:24.351
You're right. Shaggy.

1040
01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:27.454
That's something
that I'm working on.

1041
01:05:27.456 --> 01:05:28.489
We've got to do something.

1042
01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:30.858
But we're no match
against so many villains.

1043
01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:34.261
Yeah. you'd have to have
some kind of super powers

1044
01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:35.262
to stand a chance.

1045
01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:37.932
But don't worry. kids.
Coolsville Police Department--

1046
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:41.068
I might be
able to help with that.

1047
01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:42.805
Esteban.

1048
01:05:51.914 --> 01:05:52.780
Like. Scoob.

1049
01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:55.685
maybe we didn't miss out
on Halloween after all.

1050
01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:02.823
Uh-uh. no way.

1051
01:06:02.825 --> 01:06:06.929
Like. come on. Scoob.
it's the only costume left.

1052
01:06:12.501 --> 01:06:16.003
Come on. Scoob.
you're ruining it for everyone.

1053
01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:16.704
Humph.

1054
01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:22.242
Give it to me.
you little banister biter!

1055
01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:26.749
Hey. you didn't say
trick-or-treat!

1056
01:06:27.216 --> 01:06:28.916
Ha-ha. too easy!

1057
01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:30.586
Mommy!

1058
01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:31.952
Mine!

1059
01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:43.330
Okay. gang. let's split up.
and nab us some convicts.

1060
01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:45.368
Hey. there's one now.

1061
01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:46.967
Hope you miss prison food

1062
01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:49.572
because you're going
right back to...

1063
01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:51.405
Oh. apologies.

1064
01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:54.074
You have
a very convincing costume.

1065
01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:56.844
Have a great night.
And stay safe.

1066
01:06:56.846 --> 01:07:00.414
Geesh. Grown-ups. Go figure.

1067
01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:03.686
Come on. gang.
let's get to work.

1068
01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:11.394
Hello. children.

1069
01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:13.794
Not much exercise in jail.

1070
01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:17.998
That candy you're holding
looks quite valuable to me.

1071
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.969
I'll appraise it and offer you
a competitive price for it.

1072
01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:24.071
What are you talking about.
mister?

1073
01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.974
It's called stealing. kid.

1074
01:07:26.976 --> 01:07:28.442
Wait! What's it worth?

1075
01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:31.045
Now.
if I were an escaped convict.

1076
01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:32.346
where would I hide?

1077
01:07:32.348 --> 01:07:33.414
Oh!

1078
01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:36.750
Hey. Mr. Wickles.
what a night for a knight. huh?

1079
01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:38.318
Is this that karma

1080
01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.557
everybody's
always talking about?

1081
01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:47.630
Huh? What the...

1082
01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:51.065
Oh! It can't be!

1083
01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.166
Sorry. Captain Cutler.

1084
01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:56.605
Didn't mean to dampen
your Halloween spirit.

1085
01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:04.478
Boo!

1086
01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:13.887
Oh. Henry Bascombe.
you were always such a scream.

1087
01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:18.926
You want to
give me all your candy.

1088
01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:22.963
We want to give you
all our candy.

1089
01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:27.568
Wouldn't you rather
teach this evil doer a lesson?

1090
01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:28.635
Yes!

1091
01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:29.703
No. No!

1092
01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:31.371
My work here is done.

1093
01:08:35.744 --> 01:08:39.648
Hand over all of that
there candy or else.

1094
01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:43.684
Kitty!

1095
01:08:43.686 --> 01:08:47.488
Oh. such a sweet little
shmochy-woochie.

1096
01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.859
Yes. you are.

1097
01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:52.726
Forgot I'm allergic.

1098
01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:57.032
Dagnabbit!

1099
01:09:00.302 --> 01:09:02.872
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

1100
01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:40.774
Wow.
look at us. We did it.

1101
01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:43.377
Coco's costumes
sure were a big help.

1102
01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:45.946
When you use these costumes
for good.

1103
01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.080
they're not all bad.

1104
01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:51.018
Okay. time to
take this riff-raff
back to prison.

1105
01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:56.890
Now. when I call your name.
please say--

1106
01:09:56.892 --> 01:09:59.793
Not so fast!
Empty your pockets!

1107
01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:14.743
Do as the scrawny
hippy commands!

1108
01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.187
You know
you can't eat that candy.
right?

1109
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:28.021
It's stolen.

1110
01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:32.559
But. like. didn't you say
good and bad are subjective?

1111
01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.061
Only when it applies to me.

1112
01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:39.535
-Oh. so close!
-Yet so far away.

1113
01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:47.474
For some reason.

1114
01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:49.376
everyone thinks
I'm wearing a costume

1115
01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:51.547
and keeps giving me candy.

1116
01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:55.649
I'm on a strict liver
and goat-milk regimen.

1117
01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:58.120
but I thought
you two might enjoy it.

1118
01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:00.988
You know. Trevor.

1119
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:03.090
despite your dark
and gloomy exterior.

1120
01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:06.560
deep down.
you're a golden ray
of sunshine.

1121
01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:08.662
You... you really think so?

1122
01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:10.998
Like. no question
about it. man.

1123
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.735
Absolutely.

1124
01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:18.839
Well. how about that?
You were totally right!

1125
01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:25.981
Catch you dudes later!

1126
01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:29.483
Thanks for your help today.

1127
01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:32.753
I'd like to think
that under different
circumstances.

1128
01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:34.354
we'd really get along.

1129
01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:35.289
Oh. really?

1130
01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:38.091
Oh. there I go
saying the wrong thing again.

1131
01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:40.894
No. it's just that I thought
we got along great.

1132
01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:42.596
Do you know
how rare it is for me

1133
01:11:42.598 --> 01:11:45.834
to like someone
other than myself?

1134
01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:48.637
Jinkies!

1135
01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:57.012
My glasses.
I can't find my glasses.

1136
01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:04.219
Friends.

1137
01:12:05.854 --> 01:12:07.056
No.

1138
01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:09.792
Agreed.

1139
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:17.664
So. I've been meaning
to talk to you. Freddy.

1140
01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:21.968
I was thinking
about. you know.
my role in the gang.

1141
01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:22.969
What do you mean?

1142
01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:24.037
No offense. Fred.

1143
01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:26.006
but I think I should be
the leader of Mystery Inc..

1144
01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:26.707
not you.

1145
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:28.408
Whoa!
That's a strange thing to say.

1146
01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:30.877
I'm sorry.
I know it sounds crazy.
but I just feel like--

1147
01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:34.581
But. Daphne. you've always been
the leader of Mystery Inc.

1148
01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.749
Wait. seriously?

1149
01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:37.184
You remain calm under pressure.

1150
01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:40.454
you're the person
that everyone turns to
for advice.

1151
01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:42.489
and you make it all
look effortless.

1152
01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:44.291
That's what a true leader does.

1153
01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:46.927
Inspires others
to do their best.

1154
01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:47.994
and leads by example.

1155
01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:51.064
I have a much more important
and prestigious duty

1156
01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:53.402
of driving the van!

1157
01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:00.640
Like. if tonight
has taught us anything.

1158
01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:05.579
it's that
you really can have
too much of a good thing.

1159
01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:06.480
Right. Scooby-Doo?

1160
01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:09.816
Another great paradox
of the universe.

1161
01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:11.918
Well. with this case
all wrapped up.

1162
01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.787
Coco Diablo back behind bars.

1163
01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:15.856
and the prison
getting a new warden...

1164
01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:19.693
Wait. Charlie Humdrum.
the tax accountant?

1165
01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:22.129
I'm used to
working with criminals.

1166
01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:26.099
I guess things will go back
to being pretty quiet again

1167
01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:27.334
in Coolsville.

1168
01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:29.469
Not necessarily!

1169
01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:32.139
I got to say
whatever magic this is.

1170
01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.874
you did a bang-up job.

1171
01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:34.841
I wish for more cases.

1172
01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:37.110
as many cases
as you can throw our way.

1173
01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:40.414
Big cases. spooky cases.
wild cases. we're ready!

1174
01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:44.451
Thanks. wishing well.
And hey. Happy Halloween.
