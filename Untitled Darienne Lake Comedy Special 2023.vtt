-She's none
of these things yet.

7
00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:37.438
Boys. girls. gays and theys.

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.576

Hi. There we go!

15
00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:31.225
Thank God. I'm a loud mouth
fucking bitch. Oh!

16
00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.829
Does she need a microphone?
No. she doesn't. Hi.

17
00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:38.266
Does she need a railing
to go down these two steps?

18
00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.000
No!

19
00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.403
-I'm calling OSHA.
by the way.
-

20
00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.838
I'm calling OSHA. Oh. my God!

21
00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:48.008
Thank you all for joining me
on my fitness journey.

22
00:01:50.378 --> 00:01:53.714
Down those two steps.
I'm exhausted.

23
00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:55.216
Jesus fucking Christ.

24
00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.451
Oh. that's more exercise
I've had all week.

25
00:01:57.485 --> 00:01:59.687
Thank God I got a cocktail.

26
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.189
-Ooh!
-

27
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.758
Get the show started off
fucking right.

28
00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:06.093
How's everybody doing?

29
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.532
Oh. yes!

30
00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:13.201
Big girl
is in the house. honey.

31
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:15.869
Big girl is in the house
on her little fitness journey.

32
00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:18.206
Thank you. Thank you.

33
00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:19.873
Oh. my God.

34
00:02:19.907 --> 00:02:22.776
And I know we got big girls
in the audience today.

35
00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:26.980
You don't need to applaud.
I can hear you breathing.

36
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.353
It was a long walk here.

37
00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:34.888
But that does not mean

38
00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:38.459
that we are not big. gorgeous
and sexy. and fuckable. honey.

39
00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:39.493
Yes!

40
00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:45.466
Hey. honey. Hi. Hi.

41
00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.236
You know how to get a big girl
like me in bed with you?

42
00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:49.803
Piece of cake.

43
00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:53.707
Ha-ha!

44
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:55.243
Oh. hi.

45
00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:05.653
My voice isn't very deep.
but my throat is.

46
00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.955
-

47
00:03:10.258 --> 00:03:13.060
I've got to say
I'm quite the catch.

48
00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:14.728
Because I don't run very fast.

49
00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:16.397
-Uh-uh. No.

50
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.632
I know.
My pantyhose won't even run.

51
00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:23.070
My friend upstairs is. like.
"Honey. your pantyhose
are sagging at the ankles."

52
00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:24.838
I'm. like.
"I'm not wearing any."

53
00:03:26.674 --> 00:03:29.076
Oh. Ha-ha. Ah.

54
00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.412
But I will say. though.
you know. I am single.

55
00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:32.846
Shocker. I know.

56
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.014
Gasp!

57
00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.284
Anybody single here?
Single people?

58
00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.654
People in relationships?

59
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.824
Fuck you.

60
00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:45.326
-Uh. no.

61
00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.297
Oh. I don't know
why I'm single.
I'm like an animal in bed.

62
00:03:50.298 --> 00:03:52.933
-A possum. Uh...
-

63
00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:55.135
I just lie there
and pretend like I'm dead.

64
00:03:57.905 --> 00:04:00.708
And I don't have tics.

65
00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:04.845
I'm actually. um.
personally looking for.

66
00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:06.347
like. a friend with benefits.

67
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.081
No. actually. I'm looking
for a stranger with benefits.

68
00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:09.683
I got enough fucking friends.

69
00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:11.319
Oh. hi. Is anybody there?

70
00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.786
Anybody single?
Anybody looking?

71
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.724
Anybody want a big. fat.
gorgeous lady like myself?

72
00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:19.693
-Oh. No? Okay. thank you.
Thank you.
-

73
00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:22.363
"I'm terrified. I'm scared."

74
00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:25.032
My friends.
they get sex all the time.

75
00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:26.534
I mean. probably
because they're built

76
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.702
like fucking Greek gods.
you know?

77
00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:31.805
Like. chiseled.
just muscles out of marble.

78
00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:34.174
-the tiny little dicks. Um...
-

79
00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:36.877
Uh. they do. they do.

80
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.213
My one friend.
he looks like fucking Superman.
you know?

81
00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:43.216
And if I was lucky.
I would look like Spider Veins.

82
00:04:46.487 --> 00:04:49.557
I know. like.
I'm on my feet a lot. you know.

83
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.393
-and I'm a hair stylist as well.
so. you know?
-

84
00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:54.495
Oh! Thank you.
thank you.

85
00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:56.730
Thank you.

86
00:04:56.764 --> 00:04:59.600
-And I'm a slut.
so I'm on my knees a lot.
-

87
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.205
Uh. I've tried
working out. though.

88
00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:08.241
Um. at the gym.
I'm like a ninja.

89
00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.411
You'll never see me there.

90
00:05:15.282 --> 00:05:16.817
My friend. David.
was. like. "You know what?

91
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.253
"Maybe you should start small.
like. do like the couch to 5K."

92
00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:21.655
Do you know what that is?
It's like.

93
00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:23.591
"Oh. here's a little app
or whatever." and it's like.

94
00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:26.894
you go from the couch.
and then before you know it.
you do 5K.

95
00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:30.998
and then before you know it.
you're doing a fucking marathon.

96
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.502
-That's 26.2 fucking miles.
-

97
00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:36.169
No.

98
00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:40.774
-Honey. I don't even want
to drive 26.2 fucking miles.
-

99
00:05:40.808 --> 00:05:42.910
No. Gas is expensive.

100
00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:45.746
Thanks. Joe Biden. Um...

101
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.549
Let's go. Brandon!

102
00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:50.217
That was a test.
And you all passed.

103
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.420
-Thank you. Thank you.
-

104
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.755
I know we're here
with the right audience. then.

105
00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:56.524
Oh. yeah!

106
00:05:56.557 --> 00:05:57.958
But. seriously. I mean. 26...

107
00:05:57.991 --> 00:05:59.793
If your friend calls you up
and they're. like.

108
00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:01.595
"Hey. could you pick me up
from the airport?

109
00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.831
"I'm. like. 26.2 miles away."

110
00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:05.866
Nope.

111
00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.436
You should've called
a better fucking friend.

112
00:06:08.436 --> 00:06:10.438
Because that ain't me. honey.

113
00:06:10.471 --> 00:06:13.106
No. I'm not doing
no marathon
anytime soon. honey.

114
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.110
-I'm actually in the fitness
protection program...
-

115
00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:18.479
...so. I'm good. you know?

116
00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:20.981
Do you guys work out?
You guys are all... Come on.

117
00:06:21.014 --> 00:06:22.450
-WOMAN 1: Yeah.
-Yep.

118
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:24.652
Just you. fatty.

119
00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:25.986
-Just...
-

120
00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:27.621
Thank you. Thank you.

121
00:06:27.655 --> 00:06:31.191
I've tried everything. though.
Like. I joined
the Overeaters Anonymous.

122
00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:35.829
-And the 30-day chip
is a barbecue. so...
-

123
00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:37.665
Delish. I know.

124
00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:40.133
-Somebody's in the program.
Oh. I know.
-

125
00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:43.504
I'm holding out
for the sour cream
and cheddar. Ah!

126
00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:45.138
Those are good.

127
00:06:45.172 --> 00:06:46.640
You don't try those?
They're good.

128
00:06:46.674 --> 00:06:50.511
Once you pop.
it's just like me. honey.

129
00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:53.581
Oh. yeah.
But Overeaters Anonymous
is. um...

130
00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:56.316
It's a lot like
Alcoholics Anonymous.

131
00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.351
Uh. you know.
there's the 12 steps.

132
00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:01.221
-Thankfully. they're not
upstairs.
-

133
00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.556
Yeah.

134
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.257
But I think
it's funny. though.
It's. like.

135
00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:07.094
Overeaters Anonymous.

136
00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:10.598
-Anonymous.
-

137
00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:13.400
Nobody can tell
that you're an overeater.

138
00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:15.903
Nobody.

139
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.310
-Really?
-

140
00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:24.411
Anonymous.

141
00:07:24.512 --> 00:07:27.080
And. mmm-hmm. there's...
Big secret.

142
00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:31.519
Yeah. but I've tried.
like. the keto. the paleo.

143
00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:34.154
the low carb. the Atkins.
whatever it was.

144
00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:39.259
You know. I realized.
like. I'm just. like.
a fucking. uh. carb-aholic.

145
00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.427
I must be allergic.

146
00:07:40.528 --> 00:07:42.095
Like. whenever I eat carbs.

147
00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:44.632
blow up like a puffer fish.

148
00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:46.534
-Um. delish. though.

149
00:07:46.534 --> 00:07:48.301
And I tried that. uh.

150
00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:49.803
Jared from
the sandwich shop.

151
00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:52.640
You know.
the sandwich shop guy.
the Jared. Subway...

152
00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:55.008
-You know.
"Eat fresh." Um...
-

153
00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:57.545
Jared from Subway.
Do you remember Jared
from the sandwich shop?

154
00:07:57.545 --> 00:07:58.846
Yeah. Um.

155
00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:00.914
that's where you. like.
eat three sandwiches a day

156
00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:02.850
and then have sex
with underage boys.

157
00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:06.253
Oh. Oh. I'm sorry.
Was he your friend?

158
00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:08.989
-I didn't mean to offend
your fucking friend.
-

159
00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:13.093
Isn't it funny
that he started off

160
00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:15.262
with. like.
a mild cholesterol problem

161
00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:18.198
and ended up with. like.
a child molesterol problem?

162
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.069
Yeah. Yeah!

163
00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:25.038
But for me.
boys are like blackjack.

164
00:08:25.072 --> 00:08:27.407
Anything over 21 is too much.
Ha-ha.

165
00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:32.479
Hit me!
Hit me again.

166
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.583
-I like it rough.
Uh...
-

167
00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:37.585
I tried
the Richard Simmons diet.

168
00:08:37.585 --> 00:08:40.453
Uh. that's where you get sick
and then just wither away.

169
00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:42.089
-Uh...
-

170
00:08:43.591 --> 00:08:45.659
Aw. poor Richard in his shorts.

171
00:08:45.693 --> 00:08:48.095
-Yay! Uh...
-

172
00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:50.931
I got one of those fit watches.
whatever. you know?

173
00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:53.834
It's like
an apple pie watch. Um...

174
00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:57.270
But it's. like. you know...
It gives you. like.
little notifications.

175
00:08:57.304 --> 00:09:00.440
and it's. like. "Hey.
why don't you get up
and get moving?"

176
00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:05.879
Why don't I take you back
to the fucking store
where I got you from?

177
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.150
So. I threw it
across the room.

178
00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:14.087
But. um. you know. I tried.
like. the food tracker apps

179
00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:15.723
and stuff like that.
or whatever.

180
00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:17.024
So. I'm like.
entering all my food.

181
00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.759
and I'm like.
"I'm gonna be good.

182
00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:20.360
"I believe in myself.

183
00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.662
"I can do this."

184
00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:23.964
So I'm entering my food.
it's 03:00 p.m.

185
00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:26.099
and the app is. like.

186
00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:30.470
"Maybe for dinner
you should have
a handful of sleeping pills."

187
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.079
Now. I don't know

188
00:09:40.547 --> 00:09:42.850
if the app just told me
to go to bed

189
00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:45.886
because I've had enough
to eat today.

190
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.756
or maybe it told me
to fucking kill myself.

191
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:53.260
Either way.
I'll give it a shot.

192
00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:57.698
When I was a little boy.
my mom took me

193
00:09:57.731 --> 00:09:59.800
to Jazzercise classes
and stuff.

194
00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.401
I know somebody
just went. "Boy?"

195
00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.236
-Uh...
-

196
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.839
I know. Did I not mention
that I was a boy?

197
00:10:06.573 --> 00:10:07.808
Oh. my God. I hope...

198
00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:09.777
Does anybody not know
that I'm a drag queen?

199
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.412
That I'm a man? That I'm a...
You don't know?

200
00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.681
Oh. my God. Wow!

201
00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:15.816
Somebody take her
to the eye doctor's.
Thank you.

202
00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:18.385
Jesus fucking Christ.

203
00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:20.888
I don't know what gave it away.
Was it the wig?

204
00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:22.956
Ten pounds
of makeup.

205
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.624
Uh. maybe it was
the size 12...

206
00:10:24.658 --> 00:10:26.093
Uh. 8 shoe.

207
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.496
Maybe it's that.

208
00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:30.764
Maybe it's my arm hair.

209
00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:32.800
-Um. it could be anything.

210
00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:35.068
The deep voice. Thank you.

211
00:10:35.102 --> 00:10:37.905
But I don't want to be a woman.

212
00:10:37.938 --> 00:10:39.740
You know. like.
I am a drag queen.

213
00:10:39.773 --> 00:10:41.241
I am happy being a man.

214
00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:42.976
-Um. you know. thank you.
-

215
00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:48.615
I know there are some people
who are. you know. transgender.

216
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.584
and they believe
that they are born
in the wrong body.

217
00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:54.688
It's like. God. you know.
apparently. was like. "Oops."

218
00:10:54.722 --> 00:10:56.189
Uh. didn't do his paperwork.

219
00:10:56.223 --> 00:10:58.191
Um. so. you know.
that is not me.

220
00:10:58.225 --> 00:11:03.163
Like. I am very happy
and very comfortable
being a man in a dress.

221
00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:06.366
-Performing for love.
and applause and...
-

222
00:11:10.738 --> 00:11:12.505
And money.

223
00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:13.841
Please buy my merchandise.

224
00:11:13.874 --> 00:11:15.743
It's on my website.
I don't have it.

225
00:11:15.743 --> 00:11:17.177
-Um...
-

226
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.747
All of it was made in America

227
00:11:19.747 --> 00:11:21.348
by dreamer children
in cages. Uh...

228
00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:23.350
-I'm kidding.
I know it's horrible.

229
00:11:23.383 --> 00:11:24.384
It's horrible.

230
00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:26.186
Please go out there
and fucking vote.

231
00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:30.290
And remember. if you're. like.
a person who's not an ally. um.

232
00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:32.359
-I hate you. No. but...
-

233
00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:34.194
But even if you are
a straight person

234
00:11:34.227 --> 00:11:35.863
who's like.
"Well. it doesn't affect me."

235
00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:38.265
Like. listen.
abortion doesn't affect me.

236
00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:39.767
I'm never going to have
an abortion.

237
00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:41.434
But I'm here for your fight.

238
00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:43.570
-So. you've got to be
for our fight.
-

239
00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:44.637
You know?

240
00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:49.576
Let's get in a fight!

241
00:11:52.913 --> 00:11:54.281
I like to perform
for the love.

242
00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:56.149
for the applause.
for the money.

243
00:11:56.183 --> 00:11:58.051
-Um...
-

244
00:11:58.085 --> 00:11:59.820
And for the occasional
"straight dick."

245
00:11:59.853 --> 00:12:02.155
-

246
00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:04.257
Ah-ha.

247
00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:08.295
-Or the curved dick. uh...
-

248
00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:11.231
Black dick. white dick.
uh. brown dick.
it don't matter.

249
00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:15.468
-Uh. you know.
spotted dick. Um...
-

250
00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:17.905
That... By the way.
that's. like.
a British pudding.

251
00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:19.639
and I'm a fat hog.

252
00:12:19.672 --> 00:12:21.474
so I... Spotted dick.

253
00:12:21.508 --> 00:12:23.076
I don't care
if it's an ombre dick.

254
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.244
You know.
it's different colors.

255
00:12:24.277 --> 00:12:26.546
I'm into it.
I'm all there.

256
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.181
I love it. Uh...

257
00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:36.990
But it's really hard. though.
trying to date
as a drag queen

258
00:12:37.024 --> 00:12:38.591
because. you know.
they're all like...

259
00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:40.861
"If I wanted to be with a man.
I'd be with a man.

260
00:12:40.894 --> 00:12:42.562
"not somebody
dressed like a woman."

261
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.631
All right.

262
00:12:47.567 --> 00:12:51.538
So. I feel like drag queens
are kind of
like car accidents.

263
00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:53.673
You know.
everybody wants to see one.

264
00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:55.843
but nobody wants to
get involved in one.

265
00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:00.013
But I will say. though.

266
00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:03.116
like. I have been lucky.
on occasion.

267
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.085
to get a boy to. you know...

268
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:06.753
Who's like.
"You're pretty enough."

269
00:13:06.854 --> 00:13:07.855
Uh...

270
00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:11.424
Thank you.

271
00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.460
-Little boost
in my confidence here.

272
00:13:13.493 --> 00:13:14.862
Thank you.

273
00:13:14.895 --> 00:13:16.964
But I worked at this one club

274
00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:18.431
where all the straight girls

275
00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:20.033
would bring
their straight boyfriends.

276
00:13:20.067 --> 00:13:24.104
and then all the boyfriends
would magically find their way.

277
00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:27.941
backstage. down the steps
to the basement.

278
00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:29.342
all the way
around the corner

279
00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:30.978
to where
the dressing rooms were.

280
00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:33.346
Hi.

281
00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:37.450
And there was
this one boy. Sean...

282
00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:39.119
I probably shouldn't use
his name.

283
00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.990
-Sean Spicer.
No. um. so...
-

284
00:13:45.192 --> 00:13:46.326
So...

285
00:13:46.359 --> 00:13:48.561
Actually. this boy.
he was so cute.

286
00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:51.231
He was my type
because he was alive.

287
00:13:51.264 --> 00:13:53.633
-And. um...
-

288
00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.135
I mean.
nothing against dead guys.

289
00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:56.303
They're nice. too.

290
00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.972
Uh. but. you know.
it's not the same fight.

291
00:13:59.006 --> 00:14:00.573
Uh. so...

292
00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:02.642
Sorry. I don't know
where I was going with that.

293
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.645
So. this boy comes
sniffing around.

294
00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.414
Drag sniffers.
is what we used to call them.

295
00:14:07.447 --> 00:14:08.715
I mean. we used to call them
tea chasers.

296
00:14:08.748 --> 00:14:10.283
but we don't use
that word anymore.

297
00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:13.386
Um. so he comes
sniffing around and stuff.

298
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.122
And he's like. ooh.
so cute.

299
00:14:15.155 --> 00:14:18.391
Cute little. tight little.
dirty little.
white trash. trade body.

300
00:14:18.425 --> 00:14:20.660
You know?
You know the type. trade?

301
00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.462
You know. that's where
you trade sex for money.

302
00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:25.232
-Um. so. gorgeous little thing.

303
00:14:25.265 --> 00:14:26.733
So. he comes downstairs.

304
00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:29.636
And he's like. "Yeah.
you wanna suck my dick?"

305
00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:31.939
And I was like.
"Oh. maybe."

306
00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:36.809
"I don't know.
Maybe. you know. I got time."

307
00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:38.411
Oh.

308
00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:40.013
Yeah. straight boys. ugh.

309
00:14:40.047 --> 00:14:42.515
Even spaghetti's straight
till you get it hot and wet.

310
00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:45.452
-

311
00:14:45.485 --> 00:14:47.854
So then he pulls out
his dick.

312
00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:51.524
very manageable.

313
00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:01.868
Aww.

314
00:15:02.802 --> 00:15:03.870
Aww.

315
00:15:05.305 --> 00:15:07.207
Aww. Mmm.

316
00:15:07.707 --> 00:15:08.541
So cute.

317
00:15:10.077 --> 00:15:13.080
So then he tried to do
the helicopter with it.
you know?

318
00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:14.681
Do you know what that is?

319
00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:16.216
Some of the guys know.
It's. like. when you
take it out and...

320
00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:20.988
It was a fidget spinner.

321
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.293
And I have ADD.
so it's cool. um...

322
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.063
So. I was like.
"Ooh. let me play with it."

323
00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:32.732
So. I was like. "Okay.
I'll suck your dick."

324
00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.001
His girlfriend's banging
on the door.

325
00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:36.236
-but it's fine. Um...
-

326
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:39.472
So. I get down there.
Just like. "Ooh. let me. Okay."

327
00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:42.009
And I grab his dick.
I grab his dick.

328
00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:47.880
"Oh. my God.
it's the biggest thing
I've ever seen."

329
00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:51.084
"I don't know
if I can take it all the way."

330
00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:55.488
So. I started sucking his dick.
and he's like. "Oh. yeah."

331
00:15:55.522 --> 00:15:58.225
So then. you know.
I'm tickling the balls
as you do.

332
00:15:58.258 --> 00:15:59.559
-You know?
-

333
00:15:59.592 --> 00:16:02.829
-Dad taught me. And. uh...
-

334
00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:04.564
Tickling the balls and stuff.

335
00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:06.633
I start sliding my fingers.
there's the taint.
because they love that.

336
00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:08.035
It was...
A little... Mmm.

337
00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:10.503
And then. you know.
start tickling the asshole.

338
00:16:10.537 --> 00:16:13.040
and getting that finger.
getting ready.

339
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:16.876
And he's like. "Oh. yeah."

340
00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:19.812
So. you know. you can't just.
like. fucking.
you know. just...

341
00:16:19.846 --> 00:16:21.348
You know?

342
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:25.085
This is not like
a no-knock-warrant situation.

343
00:16:25.118 --> 00:16:27.354
like. "Open up. the police!"

344
00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:29.056
-Um...

345
00:16:29.056 --> 00:16:31.391
You gotta. you know. like.
ring the doorbell a little bit.

346
00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:36.063
Ding dong.
Anybody home?

347
00:16:36.063 --> 00:16:39.199
He's like. "Ah!"
So. one finger goes in.

348
00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:40.600
So nice.

349
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:43.603
And he's like.
"Oh. yeah."

350
00:16:43.636 --> 00:16:45.072
And I was like. "Oh. yeah."

351
00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:47.207
-Ding dong. ding Dong.

352
00:16:48.075 --> 00:16:50.210
Let me grab
two fingers.

353
00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:54.614
Oh!

354
00:16:55.715 --> 00:16:57.117
Get the taste out of my mouth.

355
00:16:58.318 --> 00:16:59.919
That's better. Okay.

356
00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:02.089
You say. "Ew." but really.
when it's too clean.

357
00:17:02.122 --> 00:17:03.990
you're like.
"This doesn't taste
like anything."

358
00:17:04.091 --> 00:17:06.093
-Anyway. um...
-

359
00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:08.161
Just me? All right.

360
00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:10.363
Ding dong. ding dong.
ding dong.

361
00:17:13.133 --> 00:17:15.302
I'm like.
"Oh. this is good."

362
00:17:15.335 --> 00:17:17.003
And so. I'm like.
"If he takes three fingers..."

363
00:17:17.104 --> 00:17:19.139
I mean. I'm not normally a top.

364
00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:22.275
but if he takes
three fingers. he's...

365
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:24.544
I mean. that's...
The girth. not the length.

366
00:17:24.577 --> 00:17:26.646
I'm like.
"He's ready for fucking."

367
00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:28.681
-Uh...
-

368
00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.950
So. I'm like.
"Ding dong. ding dong.
ding dong."

369
00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:32.819
-Oh. Ha-ha.

370
00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.688
AUDIENCE: Oh!

371
00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:37.724
WOMAN: Oh.. no!

372
00:17:39.126 --> 00:17:40.193
WOMAN: Oh!

373
00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.465
-Zip. Bye. All right.
-

374
00:17:45.498 --> 00:17:47.367
So. he took off.
and. um...

375
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.172
So. then I sat down there
at my makeup table.

376
00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:56.042
and grabbed a makeup wipe
to clean my fingers.

377
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.678
I know. It happens.

378
00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:00.347
Straight guys. come on.
wash your assholes.

379
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.215
-Do we have
straight people here?

380
00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:04.217
Straight guys. straight guys.
where are you?

381
00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:06.753
Yeah. a baby wipe.

382
00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:07.887
Just something.

383
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:13.160
You know. get a bidet.
They're fantastic.

384
00:18:13.193 --> 00:18:15.728
Especially in the summertime.
That brisk cold water. Ooh!

385
00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:17.597
All right.
Gets you going. Whoo!

386
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.566
I tried one of those
coffee enemas.

387
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.502
Uh. word to the wise.
cool the coffee down first.

388
00:18:24.204 --> 00:18:26.573
I'm awake. but I'm. like.
medium rare.

389
00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.241
-Uh...
-

390
00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:31.311
Anyway. so.
I'm wiping my finger.
and I was like.

391
00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:34.747
"Wait a second.
I know three fingers went in.

392
00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:36.749
"and I only have
two fingernails left."

393
00:18:40.887 --> 00:18:42.189
"Have fun pooping."

394
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.091
I was like...

395
00:18:45.192 --> 00:18:46.926
But then I was. like.
"Godammit. that was. like.

396
00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.095
"a champagne
fucking French-tip

397
00:18:49.196 --> 00:18:50.863
"with the crystals on it."

398
00:18:50.897 --> 00:18:52.765
I was mad. I wanted it back!

399
00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:55.668
I was like. "Where did
that motherfucker go?"

400
00:18:55.702 --> 00:18:57.870
I was like. "Drag is expensive."

401
00:18:57.904 --> 00:18:59.606
It is fucking expensive.
Are you kidding me?

402
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.275
That's why we're constantly
asking you for our money.

403
00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:05.678
Like. I actually registered
my drag as a non-profit

404
00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:07.447
because it doesn't make
any profits.

405
00:19:09.216 --> 00:19:10.850
Oh. my God. it's horrible.

406
00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:13.019
So. it's like. you know.
there's so many things
that you have to buy.

407
00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:15.021
the tits and shit.

408
00:19:15.054 --> 00:19:18.958
And. like. the boobs.
hip pads. dresses.

409
00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:22.929
Um. and. you know.
I have my foundation.

410
00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:25.265
Uh. and my lipstick.
and my mascara.

411
00:19:25.298 --> 00:19:27.234
and eyelashes.
and all that stuff.

412
00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:30.403
Actually. I will say. like.

413
00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:33.373
I try to give back. um.
to the gay community.

414
00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:35.608
to the straight community.
to everybody.

415
00:19:35.642 --> 00:19:39.246
because. you know.
that's really. I think.
so important these days.

416
00:19:39.246 --> 00:19:42.282
Um. all the money
that I'm raising.
even tonight.

417
00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:44.317
is going to help
the sick children.

418
00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:48.020
Jose Cuervo. Johnnie Walker.
Jim Beam...

419
00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:51.258
Lil' Tito.
Can't think about Tito.

420
00:19:53.426 --> 00:19:56.396
I love the booze!

421
00:19:57.964 --> 00:19:59.799
All my life.
I've enjoyed it.

422
00:19:59.832 --> 00:20:03.236
Even when I was a little kid.
my favorite game was playing

423
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.071
"Duck. duck. Grey Goose."

424
00:20:11.444 --> 00:20:13.079
Uh. now I do shots of insulin.

425
00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:14.447
-Uh...

426
00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:16.649
Oh.

427
00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:18.851
But the cool thing
about wearing
a corset. though.

428
00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:21.754
is you drink alcohol.
and it just sort of
sits up here.

429
00:20:21.788 --> 00:20:25.292
and it won't go through
your fucking body
because it's so goddamn tight.

430
00:20:25.325 --> 00:20:27.093
It's... It's...

431
00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:30.397
And then you take it off.
and it all hits you
like a fucking Four Loko.

432
00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:36.168
-* I'm drunk
-

433
00:20:36.202 --> 00:20:37.337
* I'm fucking wasted

434
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.440
"Hi. What are you doing?
Are you single? Hi."

435
00:20:40.473 --> 00:20:43.209
For granted.

436
00:20:45.545 --> 00:20:49.015
But ladies know
the best part of the day
is. like. taking your bra off

437
00:20:49.048 --> 00:20:50.883
at the end of the day.

438
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.722
Ah. just...

439
00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.990
But even better is when you
then take your dick out

440
00:20:58.024 --> 00:20:59.526
from between
your legs. like...

441
00:21:00.893 --> 00:21:03.863
Ah! It's the best
fucking feeling.

442
00:21:03.896 --> 00:21:05.164
Ah!

443
00:21:05.732 --> 00:21:07.334
You scratch it. um...

444
00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:09.902
With two fingernails.

445
00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:11.904
And. uh...

446
00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:15.041
Every now and then.
I get in drag
just to make myself a sandwich.

447
00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:16.376
"Make me a sandwich. bitch."

448
00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:18.578
Okay.
-

449
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.947
She's misogynistic. um.
she's crazy.

450
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.382
She's insane.

451
00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:24.216
My roommate.
he actually thinks

452
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.718
that I'm schizophrenic.

453
00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:27.787
Joke's on him.
I don't have a roommate.

454
00:21:31.924 --> 00:21:32.925
So...

455
00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:34.561
But. um. every now and then.

456
00:21:34.594 --> 00:21:38.130
I get a little bit tipsy.
a little bit tipsy.

457
00:21:38.164 --> 00:21:40.433
and then I pass out
in my makeup.

458
00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.602
And... Anybody else do that?

459
00:21:44.671 --> 00:21:45.805
Thank you.

460
00:21:45.838 --> 00:21:47.607
And then you wake up.
and your fucking pillow

461
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.410
-looks like the Shroud
of Turin. you know?
-

462
00:21:50.443 --> 00:21:52.244
I was like. "Ooh.
maybe Jesus was a drag queen."

463
00:21:52.278 --> 00:21:54.914
Um. or maybe the last supper
was barbecue.

464
00:21:54.947 --> 00:21:56.248
and it's just like a wet nap.

465
00:21:56.282 --> 00:21:59.586
-

466
00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:03.155
I know. I swear to God.
if you hear a crack of thunder.

467
00:22:03.189 --> 00:22:05.992
I might get smited by God.
All right.

468
00:22:06.025 --> 00:22:09.396
So. this. I mean. you know.
this is expensive makeup
as well.

469
00:22:09.396 --> 00:22:10.663
Drag queen. Expensive.

470
00:22:10.697 --> 00:22:12.665
I can't...
This is not Wet n Wild. honey.

471
00:22:12.699 --> 00:22:14.734
This is not...
It ain't Covergirl. honey.

472
00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:17.003
because Covergirl
doesn't cover boy.

473
00:22:18.538 --> 00:22:20.873
No. this is Sherwin-Williams.

474
00:22:22.108 --> 00:22:23.543
Home Depot.

475
00:22:23.576 --> 00:22:26.779
This is hardware store paint.
you know. in a semi-gloss.

476
00:22:26.813 --> 00:22:29.416
-Um. okay. she's dewy.
-

477
00:22:29.449 --> 00:22:32.685
Yeah. and. um...
And. of course. you know.
the corsets.

478
00:22:32.719 --> 00:22:35.522
So. if anybody does have a gun
and wants to shoot me.

479
00:22:35.555 --> 00:22:37.056
don't worry. steel bones.

480
00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:38.591
-Yeah. I know.

481
00:22:38.625 --> 00:22:40.427
Corsets are great
because they
just sort of. like.

482
00:22:40.427 --> 00:22:42.194
squeeze everything
like toothpaste.

483
00:22:42.228 --> 00:22:43.796
from the middle. just...

484
00:22:52.605 --> 00:22:53.906
Yeah. Hi.

485
00:22:54.974 --> 00:22:57.043
I love your blouse.

486
00:22:57.076 --> 00:23:00.547
Mmm-hmm. They call me.
like. a blouse. too.
because I'm a soft top.

487
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.282
No. I'm kidding. No. uh...

488
00:23:03.315 --> 00:23:05.518
No. these actually
aren't my titties.

489
00:23:05.552 --> 00:23:06.619
These are my testicles.

490
00:23:06.653 --> 00:23:08.955
-Uh...
-

491
00:23:08.988 --> 00:23:11.157
I shaved them for you.
You're welcome.

492
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.159
Thank you. Thank you.

493
00:23:13.192 --> 00:23:16.729
Yeah. I got them done
at press crafters
in about an hour.

494
00:23:16.763 --> 00:23:18.965
-Uh. so... I know.
-

495
00:23:18.998 --> 00:23:21.734
Some of the drag queens.
they wear those.
like. tit bibs.

496
00:23:21.768 --> 00:23:24.971
You know. like.
the breastplate things
or whatever.

497
00:23:25.004 --> 00:23:28.140
This is grade-A. all-beef.

498
00:23:28.174 --> 00:23:30.142
-No filler.
-

499
00:23:30.176 --> 00:23:31.544
Yeah.

500
00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:35.247
Those breastplates smell
like Band Aids
and old condoms.

501
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:37.083
And these smell like
shaving cream.

502
00:23:37.116 --> 00:23:39.986
Uh. I shave them.
Thank you.

503
00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:41.854
It actually. um...

504
00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:44.390
It's a Nerf basketball
that I cut in half.

505
00:23:44.491 --> 00:23:46.325
and then just squish
everything. and...

506
00:23:46.358 --> 00:23:47.393
Do you want to see it?

507
00:23:47.494 --> 00:23:49.028
WOMAN: Yeah!

508
00:23:49.061 --> 00:23:50.329
That costs extra.

509
00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:52.499
-Um...
-

510
00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:54.667
And then. of course.
as a drag queen.

511
00:23:54.701 --> 00:23:57.203
I. also. um...
I wear hip pads.

512
00:23:57.236 --> 00:24:01.007
Hip pads.
to give myself that hour-
and-a-half-glass figure.

513
00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:04.577
Thank you.
Thank you. Yeah.

514
00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:06.613
They're actually
made out of. uh. foam.

515
00:24:11.518 --> 00:24:13.185
-Dusty. Um...
-

516
00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:15.054
Couch foam.

517
00:24:15.087 --> 00:24:17.256
Yeah. you don't know.
And we take the couches.

518
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:20.126
and we take those. um...
The turkey knives
or whatever

519
00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:22.595
that you use to carve up
the turkey. and we just...

520
00:24:22.629 --> 00:24:25.532
Because they cut the foam.
just so you can shape it.

521
00:24:25.532 --> 00:24:27.700
and give yourself
that gorgeous little figure.

522
00:24:27.967 --> 00:24:29.001
Ooh!

523
00:24:29.035 --> 00:24:30.202
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

524
00:24:30.236 --> 00:24:31.538
Yeah.

525
00:24:31.571 --> 00:24:32.939
I'm wearing
your sectional sofa
right now...

526
00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:35.007
-...is basically
what I'm saying.

527
00:24:35.041 --> 00:24:37.276
So. I guess now
is a good time as any

528
00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:39.111
to come out as trans-sectional.

529
00:24:40.813 --> 00:24:42.181
"Don't make fun of me."

530
00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:43.950
I'm not. I'm making fun of me.

531
00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:45.284
Okay? Thank you.

532
00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:46.553
"She's trans-sectional."

533
00:24:46.553 --> 00:24:48.621
Yeah.
The kids like to play on me.

534
00:24:48.655 --> 00:24:50.022
Okay. um...

535
00:24:50.056 --> 00:24:53.993
I know. More cushion
for the pushin'.

536
00:24:54.026 --> 00:24:57.797
Literally. more cushion
for the pushin'.

537
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.968
So. actually.
these hips are made
out of a pull-out couch.

538
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:04.203
And judging
by the stains on them.

539
00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:06.372
now you know
why it's called
a pull-out couch.

540
00:25:09.642 --> 00:25:10.843
Uh...

541
00:25:11.844 --> 00:25:13.913
My mom is very Catholic.

542
00:25:13.946 --> 00:25:16.048
and so she believed in.
like. the rhythm method

543
00:25:16.082 --> 00:25:17.884
and the whole pull-out method.

544
00:25:17.917 --> 00:25:19.285
And she had five kids.

545
00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:23.389
So. she was not very good
at the pull-out game at all.

546
00:25:24.757 --> 00:25:26.092
I mean. she should have
listened to Gloria Estefan

547
00:25:26.125 --> 00:25:27.627
when she said.
"The rhythm
is going to get you."

548
00:25:29.095 --> 00:25:30.262
* Tonight

549
00:25:32.264 --> 00:25:35.835
Yes. Five kids.
We grew up out on Long Island.

550
00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:36.903
-Uh...
-WOMAN 2: Yeah!

551
00:25:36.936 --> 00:25:38.738
Is somebody here
from Long Island?

552
00:25:38.771 --> 00:25:41.608
Oh. my God.
how fantastic. Hi.

553
00:25:41.608 --> 00:25:42.642
What part?

554
00:25:42.675 --> 00:25:44.043
-WOMAN 3: Suffolk.
-Oh.

555
00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:51.483
Well.
it's beautiful out there.

556
00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:54.654
No. actually.
I'm from Long Island.

557
00:25:54.687 --> 00:25:56.422
out on North Babylon.
Suffolk County.

558
00:25:56.455 --> 00:25:58.991
I lost my accent.
I don't talk like I used to.

559
00:25:59.025 --> 00:26:02.995
But I'm the middle child
of five kids.

560
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:06.966
Um. boy. boy. me.
girl. girl.

561
00:26:09.535 --> 00:26:10.937
Yeah.

562
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.339
Physical abuse on one side
and mental abuse on another.

563
00:26:13.372 --> 00:26:15.341
Thank you. Thank you.

564
00:26:15.374 --> 00:26:20.079
-I guess I'm what you call
the "transitional" child.
-

565
00:26:20.112 --> 00:26:24.116
My parents prayed
a little too hard for a girl
third time around.

566
00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.352
Yeah. I'll meet you halfway.

567
00:26:28.387 --> 00:26:30.690
Oh. oh. Ha-ha.

568
00:26:30.723 --> 00:26:33.259
Who knows which half.
Um. so...

569
00:26:33.292 --> 00:26:36.228
But my parents. probably.
they must've. you know.

570
00:26:36.262 --> 00:26:39.031
known I was. like.
you know. "different."

571
00:26:39.065 --> 00:26:41.200
You know. a little queer.
a little...

572
00:26:41.233 --> 00:26:44.036
Um. because. like...
So. my older brothers.

573
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.372
they had. like.
this red onesie
and stuff. you know?

574
00:26:46.405 --> 00:26:50.242
So. my older brother had it.
and then it was handed down
to my next brother.

575
00:26:50.276 --> 00:26:52.411
And so then he had it.
and he grew really fast.

576
00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:54.881
so they cut the legs
off of it and stuff.

577
00:26:54.914 --> 00:26:56.382
And then by the time I got it.

578
00:26:56.415 --> 00:26:59.752
it had been washed
so many times.
that it had turned pink.

579
00:26:59.786 --> 00:27:02.889
So. there I am.
a little corny kid
in a fucking pink romper.

580
00:27:02.922 --> 00:27:04.691
-just like...
-

581
00:27:07.994 --> 00:27:10.296
-"Like my romper?
It's got pockets."
-

582
00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:12.064
"It's got pockets."
It's like girls with dresses.

583
00:27:12.098 --> 00:27:15.034
"It's got pockets."
Oh. my God. I love it. Oh.

584
00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:17.837
Or then I put on my dad's.
like. big t-shirt.

585
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.538
and he's like.
"Oh. I'm proud of my boy."

586
00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:22.241
And then I put a belt
around it.
and played Charlie's Angels.

587
00:27:23.609 --> 00:27:24.711
"Cover me. Bri."

588
00:27:27.013 --> 00:27:29.982
Oh. I mean. it was the '70s.
You know. shocking.

589
00:27:30.016 --> 00:27:33.485
Um. and so. like.
they must have seen. like.

590
00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:37.156
"Uh. this one's a little.
you know."
"a little crazy."

591
00:27:37.189 --> 00:27:39.992
Um. I would. like.
enter every room

592
00:27:40.026 --> 00:27:42.561
like there was a beaded curtain
in the doorway.

593
00:27:42.594 --> 00:27:44.163
Do you remember. like.
the beaded curtains?

594
00:27:44.196 --> 00:27:45.832
Anybody old enough
to remember.
like. Greg Brady.

595
00:27:45.865 --> 00:27:48.000
-and he had the beaded
curtains and stuff?
-

596
00:27:48.034 --> 00:27:49.969
Hello. Wooden beads and stuff.

597
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.072
So. I'd enter
every single room

598
00:27:53.105 --> 00:27:55.241
like there was
a beaded curtain
in the doorway.

599
00:27:58.644 --> 00:28:00.046
Gotta push them out of the way.

600
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.655
"Hi. everybody.

601
00:28:10.489 --> 00:28:12.124
"Welcome to my den."

602
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.094
There I was.
sitting on the floor.

603
00:28:15.127 --> 00:28:17.129
playing with
my sister's Barbies.

604
00:28:17.163 --> 00:28:19.265
My mom saw that.
and she was like.

605
00:28:19.298 --> 00:28:21.667
"No. that is not a toy
for boys."

606
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:23.936
Snatch.

607
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.205
So. then. she gave me
a He-Man doll.

608
00:28:30.009 --> 00:28:31.110
Thank you.

609
00:28:33.145 --> 00:28:36.448
Oh. my God.
it's my type.

610
00:28:36.482 --> 00:28:40.219
Those big. huge muscles.
You remember
He-Man. right? Oh!

611
00:28:40.252 --> 00:28:42.288
He can lift a ton.
He can't spell it.

612
00:28:42.321 --> 00:28:44.523
-

613
00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:47.459
Oh. and it was like. his head.
like. that page boy haircut.

614
00:28:47.493 --> 00:28:50.129
It just... It just was shaped
like a penis head.

615
00:28:50.162 --> 00:28:51.497
-Uh...
-

616
00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:54.000
Felt like one. Uh...

617
00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:58.304
I mean. you know.
with enough lube.

618
00:28:58.337 --> 00:29:00.339
-

619
00:29:01.007 --> 00:29:03.810
Uh. wow. I was pretty faggoty.

620
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.244
-Uh...
-

621
00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:06.913
We have gay people here?

622
00:29:08.314 --> 00:29:10.582
That's where there are.
Get 'em! Get 'em! No.

623
00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.086
But my brothers
would always watch.

624
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.222
like. wrestling on the TV
and stuff.

625
00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:19.091
And. as a little gay kid.
I was. like. "Whoa!"

626
00:29:19.125 --> 00:29:20.559
So. they're watching
wrestling and stuff.

627
00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:21.894
and I'm sitting there
on the couch.

628
00:29:21.928 --> 00:29:23.495
just leapfrogging
the pillows.

629
00:29:25.932 --> 00:29:27.166
"Yeah. Pin him down."

630
00:29:28.835 --> 00:29:30.903
"Pin him down like that."

631
00:29:30.937 --> 00:29:33.072
I'm just pretending
like John Cena
is going to put me

632
00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:34.740
between The Rock
and a hard place.

633
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.847
Do you guys remember.
like. wrestling in school?

634
00:29:40.847 --> 00:29:43.983
Wrestling in school.
that was fun.

635
00:29:44.016 --> 00:29:45.451
You know. going into
my teen years

636
00:29:45.484 --> 00:29:47.854
when you're starting
to develop and stuff.
you know?

637
00:29:47.854 --> 00:29:49.922
And my boo-boos were coming in.

638
00:29:49.956 --> 00:29:52.358
Um. do you remember... Ugh.

639
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:54.526
Do you remember. like.
the first position and stuff?

640
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:56.428
No. you don't?

641
00:29:56.462 --> 00:29:57.763
Do you want me to teach you?

642
00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:01.367
Because you're
in the front here.

643
00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:04.170
Okay. Come here.

644
00:30:04.203 --> 00:30:06.605
Don't trip. Don't trip.
Don't trip.

645
00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:09.208
-Don't trip over the...

646
00:30:09.241 --> 00:30:11.477
Don't smash the light.
I gotta pay for it.

647
00:30:11.844 --> 00:30:14.013
Okay. Hi.

648
00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:15.614
-What is your name?
-Ryan.

649
00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:18.617
-Ryan. Are you heterosexual?
-Absolutely not.

650
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.552
I can tell by the way
you're dressed.

651
00:30:20.586 --> 00:30:22.321
I could tell by the way
you're dressed.

652
00:30:22.354 --> 00:30:24.156
I know.
It's a great combination.

653
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.892
Okay. so. you don't remember
high school.

654
00:30:25.925 --> 00:30:27.359
like. wrestling and stuff?

655
00:30:27.994 --> 00:30:29.361
Okay. So I'll let you...

656
00:30:29.395 --> 00:30:31.530
Maybe this will refresh
your memory.

657
00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:34.833
-Okay. So. the first position.
all right?
-

658
00:30:34.867 --> 00:30:37.236
This is great.
The greatest thing
about school.

659
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:38.670
like. in wrestling.
they're. like. "Okay.

660
00:30:38.704 --> 00:30:40.572
"we're going to line
everybody up
by weight class."

661
00:30:40.606 --> 00:30:43.209
So. that's why I picked you.
because I figured.
"Huh. Close enough."

662
00:30:43.242 --> 00:30:45.011
-Um...
-

663
00:30:45.044 --> 00:30:47.146
No. But seriously.
it was like. little twink.
little twink. little twink.

664
00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:48.514
normal-sized person.

665
00:30:48.547 --> 00:30:50.516
normal-sized person.
a normal-sized...

666
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:54.253
The butch guy. the bully.
the coach.

667
00:30:56.022 --> 00:30:57.356
And then me.

668
00:30:58.357 --> 00:31:00.159
I was 12. Um. so.

669
00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:01.493
I was. like. "It's okay.
I'm heavy enough."

670
00:31:01.527 --> 00:31:03.762
Okay. So. first position.

671
00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:05.764
-All fours. Uh...
-

672
00:31:06.765 --> 00:31:09.035
-This is...
-

673
00:31:10.369 --> 00:31:13.239
This is Greco-Roman
wrestling. okay?

674
00:31:13.272 --> 00:31:16.408
So. there I am.
the second person.

675
00:31:16.442 --> 00:31:20.146
he puts his hand here
on your shoulder.

676
00:31:20.179 --> 00:31:22.949
Does anybody...
Anybody remember this
from school?

677
00:31:22.949 --> 00:31:26.085
Oh. my God. was it just me?
Did I go to a faggoty school?

678
00:31:27.786 --> 00:31:30.957
It's probably Catholic school.
So. he puts his hand here.

679
00:31:30.957 --> 00:31:32.224
So. then he also puts his...

680
00:31:32.258 --> 00:31:34.793
Oh. God.
I'm going to kneel down.
Jesus fucking Christ.

681
00:31:35.461 --> 00:31:36.963
I may never get up.

682
00:31:36.963 --> 00:31:39.631
Um. I'm going to get it up.
but I'm never going to get up.

683
00:31:43.002 --> 00:31:44.003
There. That's right.

684
00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:47.974
So. then he puts
his other leg here

685
00:31:47.974 --> 00:31:49.841
in his crotch. like. here.

686
00:31:49.875 --> 00:31:52.744
and then he reaches
the other hand around

687
00:31:53.479 --> 00:31:54.981
to caress your boobies.

688
00:31:56.515 --> 00:31:59.351
I was. like. "Oh. This is gay."

689
00:32:01.153 --> 00:32:04.056
If you ever watch.
like. high school wrestling.
this is how it starts.

690
00:32:05.624 --> 00:32:07.059
Oh. your nipples are hard.

691
00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:11.563
You smell nice. too.

692
00:32:12.231 --> 00:32:13.732
What was your name again?

693
00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:15.067
-Ryan.
-I don't care.

694
00:32:17.603 --> 00:32:20.372
And so. there I am.
12-years-old.

695
00:32:20.406 --> 00:32:22.574
trying not to get a boner
in sweatpants.

696
00:32:24.743 --> 00:32:27.579
I'm like. "Grandma peeing.
Grandma peeing.
Grandma peeing."

697
00:32:28.447 --> 00:32:31.383
I know. This is...
Are you feeling good?

698
00:32:31.417 --> 00:32:33.252
You are sturdy.
I like you. Ryan.

699
00:32:36.822 --> 00:32:38.624
Thank you. Um. so then...

700
00:32:40.492 --> 00:32:42.128
Look at that. She got up.

701
00:32:42.161 --> 00:32:43.329
Okay. You can get up.

702
00:32:43.362 --> 00:32:44.896
Ryan. I want to say thank you.
Thank you.

703
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.133
Thank you. Ryan.
for the demonstration.

704
00:32:48.267 --> 00:32:49.268
Thank you.

705
00:32:52.871 --> 00:32:56.075
So. that is seriously
the starting position

706
00:32:56.108 --> 00:32:59.411
for. like.
Greco-Roman wrestling
in high school and stuff.

707
00:32:59.445 --> 00:33:02.348
And sometimes. they're like.
"Oh. we're going to do
shirts against skins."

708
00:33:02.381 --> 00:33:05.484
That's where. skins.
you have to take
your shirt off.

709
00:33:05.517 --> 00:33:07.053
I'm like.
"Wow. this is faggoty."

710
00:33:07.053 --> 00:33:10.156
-Um... And I'm into it.

711
00:33:10.189 --> 00:33:11.357
So. there I am.

712
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.059
And I'm. like.
on top of the coach.

713
00:33:13.059 --> 00:33:15.061
because that's the only one
in my weight class.

714
00:33:16.595 --> 00:33:19.065
And there I am.
with my dick against his ass.

715
00:33:19.065 --> 00:33:20.199
And I'm like. "Ooh!"

716
00:33:21.567 --> 00:33:24.070
-"Put me in. coach." Uh...
-

717
00:33:25.104 --> 00:33:26.605
"Put me in. coach!"

718
00:33:27.806 --> 00:33:29.241
I won't say that on an airplane.

719
00:33:29.275 --> 00:33:31.443
-But. "Put me in. coach."
-

720
00:33:31.477 --> 00:33:34.613
I'm like. "Whoo!" Oh.

721
00:33:34.646 --> 00:33:37.083
So. then
they blow the whistle.
He starts it.

722
00:33:37.083 --> 00:33:40.852
He flips me over
on to that fucking mat
so goddamn fast.

723
00:33:40.886 --> 00:33:42.521
Wham! And I was. like...

724
00:33:42.554 --> 00:33:45.857
He's like. "I win."
I'm like. "I think
we both win. sir."

725
00:33:57.002 --> 00:34:00.572
Uh. And now I wonder
why I have a daddy fantasy.
you know?

726
00:34:00.606 --> 00:34:02.841
It's. like.
"Ooh. I love the daddies."

727
00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:04.476
I think I'm...
Jesus Christ.

728
00:34:05.677 --> 00:34:06.912
They're moving on.

729
00:34:09.515 --> 00:34:10.816
I'm making butter.

730
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.519
All right.

731
00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:15.521
Oh. yeah.
So. I love the daddies.

732
00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:17.123
I was with this guy last night.

733
00:34:17.156 --> 00:34:20.626
um. and he was like.
"Yeah. you want
to call me Daddy?"

734
00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:23.129
And I'm like.
"Can I just call you Dad.

735
00:34:23.129 --> 00:34:24.563
"and you just say
you're proud of me?"

736
00:34:28.767 --> 00:34:31.237
Anybody else? Yeah.

737
00:34:32.003 --> 00:34:33.139
So. I called him Daddy.

738
00:34:33.172 --> 00:34:35.641
Uh. and then
he called me a cab.

739
00:34:35.674 --> 00:34:37.143
-and. uh...
-

740
00:34:37.143 --> 00:34:39.478
Which is fair.
because I was wearing
a yellow dress.

741
00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:42.013
"You're a cab."

742
00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:44.650
Anyway. I know.

743
00:34:44.683 --> 00:34:47.819
I know. Are they still yellow?
Who takes it...
All right. Anyway

744
00:34:47.853 --> 00:34:50.489
Uh. But my dad. though.
he actually noticed...

745
00:34:50.522 --> 00:34:52.658
He noticed
that I was getting a little.
you know...

746
00:34:52.691 --> 00:34:55.661
Like. apparently. in my family.

747
00:34:55.694 --> 00:34:58.730
I don't have any cousins.
aunts. uncles...
Nobody's gay.

748
00:34:58.764 --> 00:35:01.233
I'm the only fruit
on my family tree. like...

749
00:35:01.267 --> 00:35:02.168
WOMAN: Whoo!

750
00:35:02.201 --> 00:35:04.736
Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you.

751
00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:07.839
Random genetic fabulosity.
That's what it is.

752
00:35:07.873 --> 00:35:10.509
Yeah. So. he always wanted
to butch me up.

753
00:35:10.542 --> 00:35:13.445
He's. like. "Throw a ball!
I want you to throw a ball.

754
00:35:13.479 --> 00:35:14.946
"Just fucking throw a ball."

755
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.682
I'm. like. "All right. God."

756
00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.954
So. then I finally threw a ball.
and he didn't even attend.

757
00:35:32.998 --> 00:35:35.033
I mean. I don't blame him.
you know?

758
00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:37.503
It's one of those.
like. Eyes Wide Shut  sex balls

759
00:35:37.536 --> 00:35:39.771
but. you know...

760
00:35:39.805 --> 00:35:41.307
Like. I'm never going to have
sex with my dad.

761
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.509
Ew. gross.

762
00:35:43.542 --> 00:35:46.545
He's a horrible kisser.
and that is a dealbreaker
in my house.

763
00:35:48.013 --> 00:35:49.215
I'm just kidding.
He's really good.

764
00:35:49.248 --> 00:35:51.049
-Uh. anyway...
-

765
00:35:51.817 --> 00:35:52.951
Grabs the hands.

766
00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:54.653
Oh. that is fucking twisted.

767
00:35:55.587 --> 00:35:57.323
That was twisted.
I know.

768
00:35:57.356 --> 00:36:00.826
I was. like. "Oh. my God.
Mom. how did I end up
this fucking twisted?

769
00:36:00.859 --> 00:36:03.094
"Did you drop me on my head
as a baby?"

770
00:36:03.128 --> 00:36:04.330
And she's like...

771
00:36:07.065 --> 00:36:08.900
"Hon. you got to be held
to be dropped."

772
00:36:11.237 --> 00:36:13.539
I was. like.
"Holy fucking shit.

773
00:36:13.572 --> 00:36:17.709
"Wow! I'm going
to make a therapist
very rich someday."

774
00:36:17.743 --> 00:36:21.413
I know. I was. like.
"Did you smoke
while you were pregnant?"

775
00:36:21.447 --> 00:36:23.882
She was like. "Uh.
only when I drank."

776
00:36:25.751 --> 00:36:27.253
Um...

777
00:36:27.253 --> 00:36:30.389
That was the '70s. man.
The '70s were fucking wild.

778
00:36:30.422 --> 00:36:33.091
I don't know if anybody
is old enough
to remember that shit.

779
00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:35.294
Jesus. just me?

780
00:36:35.327 --> 00:36:38.264
-Thanks. Wow.
Thank you.
-

781
00:36:38.297 --> 00:36:41.267
I'm the chaperone today.
You kids be good now.

782
00:36:41.267 --> 00:36:42.568
No. the '70s were wild.

783
00:36:42.601 --> 00:36:44.403
I mean. I don't know
how I ended up so fucked up.

784
00:36:44.436 --> 00:36:46.338
It could have been. like.
the leaded paint.

785
00:36:46.372 --> 00:36:48.307
the leaded gasoline that we had.

786
00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.109
the Teflon pans
that would just scrape off
into your food.

787
00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:54.145
and just pepper it
with some flavoring
and cancer.

788
00:36:54.179 --> 00:36:56.014
Oh. remember Shrinky Dinks?

789
00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:57.283
Shrinky Dinks?

790
00:36:57.316 --> 00:37:01.920
Yeah. you take plastic
and put it in the oven.

791
00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:05.190
-And then bake it
at 500 fucking degrees.
-

792
00:37:05.291 --> 00:37:07.493
That smells great.

793
00:37:08.894 --> 00:37:10.596
No wonder why
I got fucking cancer.

794
00:37:10.629 --> 00:37:13.599
Jesus. Don't worry.
they cut it all out
of me. It's fine.

795
00:37:13.632 --> 00:37:16.435
Uh. true story. You know.
wear sunscreen. kids.

796
00:37:16.468 --> 00:37:19.004
-Oh. Good times.

797
00:37:19.037 --> 00:37:20.506
I know. That actually
is a true story.

798
00:37:20.539 --> 00:37:23.074
I actually did end up
with a little melanoma.

799
00:37:23.108 --> 00:37:24.576
Uh. so get your skin checked.

800
00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:26.378
And if anybody...
You know. Ryan.

801
00:37:26.412 --> 00:37:28.079
if you need me
to check your body...

802
00:37:30.115 --> 00:37:31.317
You know. I'm here for you.

803
00:37:33.552 --> 00:37:35.321
You know?
Are you with your boyfriend?

804
00:37:35.887 --> 00:37:37.856
Oh. Oh. See?

805
00:37:37.889 --> 00:37:39.224
Do you have a boyfriend?

806
00:37:39.325 --> 00:37:41.327
Oh. Oh! Oh. hi.

807
00:37:42.428 --> 00:37:45.130
I don't either.

808
00:37:48.634 --> 00:37:51.570
Ah. so. yeah.
So. you know. cancer.
Good times. fun.

809
00:37:51.603 --> 00:37:53.472
But you know what. though?
They say one in two people

810
00:37:53.505 --> 00:37:55.341
will get cancer
in their lifetime.

811
00:37:55.341 --> 00:37:57.108
So. I took one for the team.

812
00:37:57.142 --> 00:37:58.877
Uh. so. you're welcome.

813
00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:02.047
And so. now. of course.
since I had the skin cancer.

814
00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.649
I'm back to being a fat kid

815
00:38:03.682 --> 00:38:05.617
wearing a t-shirt
in the goddamn pool.

816
00:38:05.651 --> 00:38:08.620
So. any other fat kids
had to wear the pool t-shirt.

817
00:38:08.654 --> 00:38:10.822
and they're like.
"Oh. this will cover
my boobies."

818
00:38:11.056 --> 00:38:12.691
No.

819
00:38:12.724 --> 00:38:15.361
-Now you're just
in a wet t-shirt contest.
-

820
00:38:15.361 --> 00:38:18.397
* Pour some sugar on me

821
00:38:19.498 --> 00:38:23.001
Yeah. And in the. you know.
'70s and '80s.

822
00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:24.636
like. there were
the latchkey kids.

823
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:27.072
I don't know if...
Anybody a latchkey kid?

824
00:38:27.105 --> 00:38:28.474
That's where. you know.

825
00:38:28.507 --> 00:38:30.141
you didn't have
a babysitter
or anything like that.

826
00:38:30.175 --> 00:38:31.843
There was nobody for you.

827
00:38:31.877 --> 00:38:34.680
Your parents give you a key.
and you just let yourself
in the house.

828
00:38:34.713 --> 00:38:36.882
But I didn't think
I was a latchkey kid

829
00:38:36.915 --> 00:38:39.851
because they never gave me
a key to the house.

830
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.022
I. like. was lucky
if I got the fucking code

831
00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:45.857
to the garage door opener.

832
00:38:45.891 --> 00:38:47.693
So. I would sit there
and play with myself...

833
00:38:47.726 --> 00:38:50.562
-By myself. and...
-

834
00:38:50.596 --> 00:38:52.664
I'd usually hide up in the attic

835
00:38:52.698 --> 00:38:55.734
and play with my dad's
porno magazines.

836
00:38:55.767 --> 00:38:58.837
Every dad has. like.
a stash of porno
magazines. right?

837
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.839
And. of course.
I would sit there
and go through them.

838
00:39:00.872 --> 00:39:02.974
you know.
for the "articles."

839
00:39:04.476 --> 00:39:06.912
Because those were the pages
that weren't stuck together.

840
00:39:09.648 --> 00:39:13.419
I know. Oh. How?
This is all making sense.
isn't it?

841
00:39:13.452 --> 00:39:14.953
Thank you. Thank you.

842
00:39:14.986 --> 00:39:18.156
I'm saving a lot of money
on therapy this week.

843
00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:20.291
But I would sit there.
and I would go through
the magazines.

844
00:39:20.325 --> 00:39:21.793
and I would find
the centerfold and stuff.

845
00:39:21.827 --> 00:39:24.796
and she was like.
"Ooh. my turn-ons are.

846
00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.132
"mmm. big packages."

847
00:39:27.165 --> 00:39:28.934
I was like.
"Oh. I love presents."

848
00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:31.503
-"Me. too. Oh. my God."

849
00:39:31.537 --> 00:39:34.105
"Pizza." "Oh. fuck.
I love pizza. Shit. yeah.

850
00:39:34.139 --> 00:39:35.441
"Oh. my God. Me. too."

851
00:39:35.474 --> 00:39:36.808
"I'm a Sagittarius."

852
00:39:36.842 --> 00:39:39.478
"I'm a Sagittarius. too.
Oh. my God! Yeah."

853
00:39:39.511 --> 00:39:42.981
"Turn-offs.
'Guys with hairy backs.'"
I was like...

854
00:39:44.516 --> 00:39:45.984
I don't know. I mean. I...

855
00:39:47.486 --> 00:39:49.054
At least you know
you're fucking a man.

856
00:39:49.087 --> 00:39:50.456
-Uh...
-

857
00:39:50.489 --> 00:39:52.558
Not so bad. Yeah. Um...

858
00:39:52.591 --> 00:39:53.959
So. yeah. turn-offs.

859
00:39:53.992 --> 00:39:56.795
And I was like.
"Wow. I really decided
that. um.

860
00:39:56.828 --> 00:39:58.329
"there's probably
no chance in hell

861
00:39:58.363 --> 00:39:59.465
"that I'm going
to be straight."

862
00:39:59.498 --> 00:40:02.000
There's no...
No chance in hell.

863
00:40:02.033 --> 00:40:04.936
And my mom kind of had a clue.

864
00:40:05.671 --> 00:40:07.138
She was very Catholic.

865
00:40:07.172 --> 00:40:10.341
and so she decided
to sign me up
to be an altar boy.

866
00:40:11.777 --> 00:40:15.547
I know. you're like. "Oh. Ooh."
But I mean. free dress.

867
00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:19.985
Sips of the communion wine
and. you know...

868
00:40:21.687 --> 00:40:23.188
You know.
I love that... Yeah.

869
00:40:23.221 --> 00:40:24.756
So. I was like. "Yeah.
sign me up."

870
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:26.725
And then. the ability
to be on stage.

871
00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:29.861
I was like. "Oh my God."
And he's like. "It's an altar."

872
00:40:29.895 --> 00:40:32.263
-"Show some fucking respect."

873
00:40:32.297 --> 00:40:33.499
I was like. "Oh. okay."

874
00:40:33.532 --> 00:40:35.934
So. Father.
Daddy. whatever. uh...

875
00:40:38.904 --> 00:40:40.672
So. with the altar boy.
it's like.

876
00:40:40.706 --> 00:40:42.173
"Okay. we're going
to the altar." and stuff.

877
00:40:42.207 --> 00:40:44.375
and you sit there.
and you kneel down
on the steps.

878
00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:45.677
and you have your bells
and everything.

879
00:40:45.711 --> 00:40:48.346
I'm like. "Okay.
am I stage left
or stage right?"

880
00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:51.016
-"It's an altar."

881
00:40:51.049 --> 00:40:52.618
Did you hear
there was a gay guy
who went to church

882
00:40:52.651 --> 00:40:54.152
because he heard
there was a man
hung like this?

883
00:40:56.555 --> 00:40:57.723
Oh. my God...

884
00:40:59.424 --> 00:41:00.726
If you hear
a crack of thunder...

885
00:41:00.759 --> 00:41:03.529
-And smell bacon.

886
00:41:03.529 --> 00:41:05.697
You know I've been smited
by God. Anyway...

887
00:41:05.731 --> 00:41:10.201
So. during part
of the performance

888
00:41:10.235 --> 00:41:12.671
of Jesus and the whatevers...

889
00:41:14.239 --> 00:41:17.375
He's like. "This is my body."
and he grabs the Eucharist...

890
00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:18.710
You know. the...

891
00:41:18.744 --> 00:41:20.712
You know.
the bread.

892
00:41:20.746 --> 00:41:22.447
the chip. the whatever
the fuck it is.

893
00:41:23.682 --> 00:41:25.350
I know. Oh. my God.
I'm going right to hell.

894
00:41:25.383 --> 00:41:27.452
in a Gasoline wig
and a paper dress.

895
00:41:27.553 --> 00:41:29.120
Um. so...

896
00:41:29.154 --> 00:41:32.290
So. I'm sitting there.
and he's like.
"This is the body of Christ.

897
00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:34.025
"Eat it in memory of me."

898
00:41:34.059 --> 00:41:36.361
And then you ring the bells.

899
00:41:36.394 --> 00:41:38.029
And it's like. ooh. joyous.

900
00:41:38.864 --> 00:41:41.032
So. the priest stares me down.

901
00:41:41.066 --> 00:41:45.136
-I was like. "What the fuck
did I do? Jesus."
-

902
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:47.138
So. then we go back
into the back of the rectory.

903
00:41:47.172 --> 00:41:48.239
and he's like. "All right.

904
00:41:50.576 --> 00:41:55.814
"next time you ring the bells.
could you do it
below your head?"

905
00:41:55.847 --> 00:41:58.984
-I'm like. "Whoo!"
-

906
00:41:59.017 --> 00:42:02.654
* You can ring my bell *

907
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:08.093
Swear to God.
I am going to get smited
by God. I tell you.

908
00:42:08.126 --> 00:42:11.830
And when I die. I think
I want my remains

909
00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:14.499
spread around
an amusement park.

910
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.804
I want. like. you know.
maybe my head
at Magic Mountain.

911
00:42:18.837 --> 00:42:22.674
-You know. I don't want
to be cremated.
-

912
00:42:22.708 --> 00:42:25.310
Why bother?
Head at Magic Mountain.

913
00:42:25.343 --> 00:42:27.278
my leg over at Rapid Rivers.

914
00:42:28.046 --> 00:42:30.081
My penis at It's a Small World.

915
00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:33.852
Not 'cause it's small.

916
00:42:33.885 --> 00:42:35.854
'Cause it's been around
a lot of daddies.

917
00:42:35.887 --> 00:42:37.989
waiting to put their kids
inside of me.

918
00:42:38.523 --> 00:42:40.458
Oh!

919
00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.427
And then the kids start
to slide out.

920
00:42:43.995 --> 00:42:46.464
Like those crappy carnivals
and. like. Ashtabula.

921
00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:48.433
You know. whoa!

922
00:42:48.466 --> 00:42:50.468
I know. it's horrible.
Don't get on those things.

923
00:42:52.003 --> 00:42:54.640
Gross. I'm disgusting.
Thank you.

924
00:42:56.642 --> 00:42:57.809
Honestly. if I was cremated.

925
00:42:57.843 --> 00:42:59.344
I'd burn
like a fucking tire fire.

926
00:42:59.377 --> 00:43:03.849
It's just
all this fucking plastic
and foam.

927
00:43:03.882 --> 00:43:07.385
But my mom prayed very hard
for me to be straight
and everything.

928
00:43:08.654 --> 00:43:10.421
and her prayers
were finally answered.

929
00:43:10.956 --> 00:43:12.157
The answer was. "No."

930
00:43:16.795 --> 00:43:18.429
Thank you. Thank you.

931
00:43:19.264 --> 00:43:20.565
Thank you.

932
00:43:20.666 --> 00:43:22.734
All the boys
who are just lining up
to date me.

933
00:43:22.768 --> 00:43:24.202
Thank you. Yeah.

934
00:43:24.235 --> 00:43:28.073
So. I guess my career
as an altar boy
has been ended.

935
00:43:28.807 --> 00:43:30.776
So. now I'm an. "altered boy".

936
00:43:32.143 --> 00:43:34.145
-Thank you. Thank you.
-

937
00:43:35.413 --> 00:43:37.582
I know. Maybe I just wasn't
the priest's type.

938
00:43:38.483 --> 00:43:39.685
So...

939
00:43:39.685 --> 00:43:41.052
I mean. I think
I was a cute kid

940
00:43:41.086 --> 00:43:43.054
because there was
this windowless white van

941
00:43:43.088 --> 00:43:45.556
that always used to pull up
on my block.

942
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.326
Yeah. he was like.

943
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.162
"You want some candy?"

944
00:43:51.196 --> 00:43:52.430
And I was like.

945
00:43:53.699 --> 00:43:55.400
"What kind of candy?"

946
00:43:57.535 --> 00:44:01.139
"Hard candy!"

947
00:44:01.172 --> 00:44:02.874
"Come back
when you have chocolate."

948
00:44:04.075 --> 00:44:05.276
Maybe Butterfingers.

949
00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:07.979
So buttery.
and they slide right in.

950
00:44:08.013 --> 00:44:09.314
Uh... I know.

951
00:44:09.347 --> 00:44:11.249
He couldn't throw me
in the van if he tried.

952
00:44:11.282 --> 00:44:12.283
I was a fat kid.

953
00:44:13.418 --> 00:44:16.154
"Use your legs."

954
00:44:16.187 --> 00:44:19.024
All right. you know...
But I probably
wasn't very cute.

955
00:44:19.057 --> 00:44:20.726
But look at me now.

956
00:44:22.894 --> 00:44:25.263
I know.
Oh. my God. Pandering.

957
00:44:26.564 --> 00:44:29.267
I know. Even as a man.
like. all the time.
like. women...

958
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.338
Women tell me all the time.
"I wish you weren't gay."

959
00:44:33.371 --> 00:44:35.006
And by women.
I mean my mother.

960
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.175
-And...
-

961
00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:39.210
But then. you know.
I wasn't an altar boy.

962
00:44:39.244 --> 00:44:43.548
So. then. you know.
the '80s came along.
and I was a teenager.

963
00:44:43.581 --> 00:44:47.753
and getting ready
for my sexual. like.
"Ooh. this is... I'm ready."

964
00:44:47.753 --> 00:44:49.855
And it was the late '80s. Wow.

965
00:44:49.888 --> 00:44:53.358
Coming out of the closet
in the late '80s
is a great idea. right?

966
00:44:53.391 --> 00:44:57.963
I don't know if everybody
remembers the '80s.
and coming out as gay.

967
00:44:57.996 --> 00:45:02.367
but I'll inform you
that there was a "cancer"
that was going around.

968
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.170
sort of destroying
the gay community.

969
00:45:05.203 --> 00:45:06.772
It was called the Reagans.

970
00:45:16.782 --> 00:45:19.818
Nancy Reagan.
that fucking throat goat slut!

971
00:45:21.352 --> 00:45:22.954
Did you guys know about that?
Her throat got stretched...

972
00:45:22.988 --> 00:45:25.190
Yes. I know.
She's making her...

973
00:45:25.223 --> 00:45:27.893
So. apparently.
all the men in Hollywood.

974
00:45:27.926 --> 00:45:29.394
they were asked.
"Who gave the best head?"

975
00:45:29.427 --> 00:45:31.797
They were like.
"Nancy Reagan."

976
00:45:31.797 --> 00:45:34.966
Nancy fucking Reagan?

977
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.070
Jesus Christ.
That fucking pinched bitch!

978
00:45:39.104 --> 00:45:40.806
Just say no.

979
00:45:40.839 --> 00:45:42.473
She had so many
fucking face lifts.

980
00:45:42.507 --> 00:45:44.309
That's how I think
she kept her throat

981
00:45:44.342 --> 00:45:45.676
-nice and tight.
-

982
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:48.679
That face has more stitches
than the AIDS Quilt.

983
00:45:50.816 --> 00:45:52.250
Listen. I can make that joke

984
00:45:52.283 --> 00:45:53.919
because I have friends
on the fucking quilt.
All right?

985
00:45:53.952 --> 00:45:54.986
AUDIENCE: Aww.

986
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.654
It's sad. but true.

987
00:45:56.687 --> 00:45:59.324
But you know what. though?
That's how we honor them.
Thank you.

988
00:45:59.357 --> 00:46:02.260
-Yeah.

989
00:46:04.529 --> 00:46:07.598
It was the AIDS epidemic
that had come along.
late '80s.

990
00:46:07.632 --> 00:46:09.467
You know.
it was like everything's.
"AIDS. AIDS. AIDS."

991
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.102
"You're going to get AIDS."

992
00:46:11.136 --> 00:46:12.904
"You drinking a glass
out of somebody.
You're going to get AIDS."

993
00:46:12.938 --> 00:46:14.873
I was like. "Wow.
maybe I should
come out of the closet."

994
00:46:15.106 --> 00:46:16.574
No.

995
00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:19.510
So. it was a really rough time
to be. you know. a teenager

996
00:46:19.544 --> 00:46:20.846
coming into your sexually...

997
00:46:20.879 --> 00:46:24.515
You know. your blossoming
of your sexuality.

998
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:28.586
And with AIDS being there.
everybody thought. like...

999
00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:30.856
You know. when somebody
would die. one of our friends.

1000
00:46:30.856 --> 00:46:34.759
they'd be like.
"Mmm. was it... Was it AIDS?"

1001
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.028
I was like.
"No. it was a plane crash."

1002
00:46:38.463 --> 00:46:40.465
"Did he die of AIDS
on the plane

1003
00:46:40.498 --> 00:46:42.868
-"before it crashed?'
-

1004
00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:45.971
Like. that's how
fucking bad it was.
You can look this up.

1005
00:46:46.004 --> 00:46:47.472
By the way.
there was an airline

1006
00:46:47.505 --> 00:46:50.041
that decided
not to pay full benefits

1007
00:46:50.075 --> 00:46:51.943
to people who had died
in a plane crash

1008
00:46:51.977 --> 00:46:53.311
because they were HIV-positive.

1009
00:46:53.344 --> 00:46:54.880
-Yeah.

1010
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.481
This is fucking true.
You can google it.

1011
00:46:56.514 --> 00:46:58.884
Not now.
but you can google it.

1012
00:46:58.884 --> 00:47:00.218
I know. it was horrible.

1013
00:47:00.251 --> 00:47:03.121
And it was such
a horrible thing
for us. as gays.

1014
00:47:03.154 --> 00:47:04.522
to try and come out.

1015
00:47:04.555 --> 00:47:08.894
So. my parents saw me.
sort of. coming into my own.

1016
00:47:08.894 --> 00:47:11.196
and they were like.
"Well. we'll put a stop
to this."

1017
00:47:11.229 --> 00:47:13.231
They moved me
up to Rochester. New York.

1018
00:47:14.499 --> 00:47:16.367
-Wow.

1019
00:47:16.401 --> 00:47:17.735
Thank you. Thank you.

1020
00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:19.537
-Are you from Rochester?
-MAN: I went to school there.

1021
00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.606
You went to school there?
See. that's Rochester.
you know.

1022
00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:24.375
Oh. Rochester
is like 6 degrees
of Kevin Bacon.

1023
00:47:24.409 --> 00:47:27.045
Everybody knows somebody
who suffered.

1024
00:47:28.914 --> 00:47:31.282
Np. but. like. Rochester.
New York. you know.

1025
00:47:31.316 --> 00:47:35.586
there's only one gay bar.
and it's only gay
on Thursdays.

1026
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.623
So. you know. you're like.
"Yeah. I can come out."

1027
00:47:38.656 --> 00:47:41.826
But Rochester. New York.
is kind of
like a theme park as well.

1028
00:47:41.927 --> 00:47:44.829
Uh. if the theme
is sadness and despair.

1029
00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:50.635
I know. The leaves
fall off the trees in the fall.

1030
00:47:50.668 --> 00:47:53.171
not because it's getting cold.
they just die of boredom.

1031
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.808
So. we moved to the suburbs.
into a little cul-de-sac.

1032
00:47:57.842 --> 00:48:00.645
which is French
for a "dead end." I think.

1033
00:48:00.678 --> 00:48:03.348
Um. I don't speak French.

1034
00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:05.316
French people
give me the crepes.

1035
00:48:06.952 --> 00:48:07.953
I love a dad joke.

1036
00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.822
Love daddies.
I love dad jokes. you know.

1037
00:48:11.856 --> 00:48:13.591
So. instead of going
to gay bars.

1038
00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:15.826
-I went out to The Rocky
Horror Picture Show.
-

1039
00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:17.328
I know. right?

1040
00:48:17.362 --> 00:48:19.764
Which is probably gayer
than any fucking gay bar
I've ever been to.

1041
00:48:19.797 --> 00:48:22.400
You know?
It's. like. a transsexual.
like. making a muscle man.

1042
00:48:22.433 --> 00:48:23.734
Like. "I'm in."

1043
00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:25.370
So. yeah.

1044
00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:28.773
And our local production
had this drag queen.
and I was like.

1045
00:48:28.806 --> 00:48:32.343
"Why is a woman
playing a drag queen?
I don't..."

1046
00:48:32.377 --> 00:48:34.179
They were like.
"That's not a woman.
that's a drag queen."

1047
00:48:34.212 --> 00:48:36.281
And this was
my first experience
with drag queens.

1048
00:48:36.314 --> 00:48:39.017
I'm like. "Wow.
his fucking Aggy Dune..."

1049
00:48:41.386 --> 00:48:44.355
I know. I don't know
if anybody knows.
Rochester. New York.

1050
00:48:44.389 --> 00:48:45.856
You can look her up. Aggy Dune.

1051
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:47.993
-A-G-G-Y. Why?
Because we love you.
-

1052
00:48:47.993 --> 00:48:50.561
And so. I was like.
"She's stunning.

1053
00:48:50.595 --> 00:48:52.530
"I have to go.
I have to do this.

1054
00:48:52.563 --> 00:48:54.865
"This is my calling.
I have to be this."

1055
00:48:54.899 --> 00:48:57.468
So. after the show.
we would always
go to this restaurant

1056
00:48:57.502 --> 00:49:01.006
called The Princess. and...
Another clue.

1057
00:49:01.006 --> 00:49:03.008
And so. it was great

1058
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:07.012
because the drag queens
would parade
in to the fucking diner

1059
00:49:07.012 --> 00:49:10.215
and these straight boys
would always heckle them.

1060
00:49:10.248 --> 00:49:14.385
And so. there was
this one drag queen
named Onyx.

1061
00:49:14.419 --> 00:49:16.121
Six-foot-nine.
and worth the climb.

1062
00:49:17.555 --> 00:49:20.358
She called herself Onyx
because she was
big. black and hard.

1063
00:49:20.391 --> 00:49:22.027
WOMAN: Whoo!

1064
00:49:22.027 --> 00:49:24.295
-Like the stone.
-

1065
00:49:24.329 --> 00:49:26.497
And so. she's walking
through there in her gown.

1066
00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:28.033
and these straight boys
are like.

1067
00:49:28.033 --> 00:49:30.035
"Hey! We want
to see you deep-throat

1068
00:49:30.035 --> 00:49:31.669
"that ketchup bottle."

1069
00:49:32.437 --> 00:49:34.539
And she goes. "Which end?"

1070
00:49:36.241 --> 00:49:38.043
I was like. "That is what
I want to fucking be."

1071
00:49:38.076 --> 00:49:40.711
I was like. "Slay. queen.
Yas. Werk."

1072
00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.315
"I want to have
that kind of confidence

1073
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:46.651
"to slay
the fucking straggots."

1074
00:49:46.684 --> 00:49:50.421
Straggots is what
we call straight people
who are just faggots.

1075
00:49:52.757 --> 00:49:57.328
So. after The Princess.
they decided to invite me
to an after-hours party.

1076
00:49:57.362 --> 00:49:58.663
I'm like. "Ooh. my first party."

1077
00:49:58.696 --> 00:50:00.365
I was. like...
I was all there.

1078
00:50:00.398 --> 00:50:01.766
And then I'm sitting there.

1079
00:50:01.799 --> 00:50:04.502
And there was
another drag queen.
Rhoda Dicken.

1080
00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:08.606
And so I'm playing
with the makeup and stuff.

1081
00:50:08.639 --> 00:50:10.908
and she's like.
"Let's put you in drag."

1082
00:50:10.941 --> 00:50:12.743
I was like. "Ooh. I'm there."

1083
00:50:12.777 --> 00:50:14.179
So. they threw me into drag

1084
00:50:14.212 --> 00:50:16.914
and they were like.
"Oh my God.
you're so pretty."

1085
00:50:18.449 --> 00:50:19.584
You know.
the lighting was nice.

1086
00:50:19.617 --> 00:50:22.019
-So. they're like.

1087
00:50:22.053 --> 00:50:25.190
"You look like Ricki Lake
from the movie Hairspray.

1088
00:50:25.223 --> 00:50:27.758
"You should be Ricki Lake.
That should be a drag name."

1089
00:50:27.792 --> 00:50:29.627
I'm like. I don't want to.
you know. get sued.

1090
00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.262
So. they're like.

1091
00:50:31.296 --> 00:50:33.064
"Be Darienne Lake."

1092
00:50:33.098 --> 00:50:37.435
And for those...
Some of you who know...
You know. like you. sir.

1093
00:50:37.468 --> 00:50:41.706
Darienne Lake
is a an amusement park
near Rochester. New York.

1094
00:50:44.642 --> 00:50:46.577
Yeah. and like
an amusement park.

1095
00:50:46.611 --> 00:50:48.546
usually. people puke
after they ride me.

1096
00:50:49.914 --> 00:50:51.316
So. there you have it.

1097
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:55.086
So. then I became
Darienne Lake.
which was fantastic.

1098
00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:59.990
I was accepted by this.
like. drag community.
and loved. and...

1099
00:51:00.825 --> 00:51:02.827
So. then I was 18 years old.

1100
00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.830
I was a fabulous
little drag queen.

1101
00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:09.700
Living at home
with my very Catholic mother.

1102
00:51:11.336 --> 00:51:13.838
Taking my bag of drag.
and. ploop. throwing it
out the window.

1103
00:51:13.871 --> 00:51:16.541
and then running
around the bushes.
and getting in drag.

1104
00:51:16.574 --> 00:51:18.176
and going off to do the shows.

1105
00:51:18.209 --> 00:51:20.145
And so I was doing
the shows.
and doing the shows.

1106
00:51:20.178 --> 00:51:22.213
and having the time
of my fucking life.

1107
00:51:22.247 --> 00:51:25.683
I was 18. I was making.
like. $17.

1108
00:51:27.885 --> 00:51:29.987
These queens these days.
"I charge $5.000."

1109
00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.522
Fuck you. Pay your dues.

1110
00:51:31.556 --> 00:51:33.858
-Anyway...
-

1111
00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:39.597
We would be lucky
if they gave us
two drink tickets and $17.

1112
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:44.269
So. then one night.
I come in.
and I'm in full drag.

1113
00:51:45.203 --> 00:51:48.038
And the light clicks on.
and it's my mother.

1114
00:51:48.072 --> 00:51:49.607
WOMAN: Oh!

1115
00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.041
Did you ever see
Fatal Attraction

1116
00:51:51.075 --> 00:51:52.943
when Glenn Close
is sitting in the dark.

1117
00:51:52.977 --> 00:51:55.880
clicking the light
on and off? That was it.

1118
00:51:56.781 --> 00:51:59.016
The fucking shit
had hit the fan.

1119
00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:00.685
The Bible hit the fag.

1120
00:52:00.718 --> 00:52:02.920
-Like. it was...

1121
00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:06.023
She was like.
"This is disgusting.

1122
00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:08.859
"What is this kinky shit?
You are disgusting.

1123
00:52:08.893 --> 00:52:11.296
"Don't you bring the shit
into my fucking house.

1124
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:12.830
"How dare you!

1125
00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:14.965
"Are you dressing like this
so you can go
into women's bathrooms.

1126
00:52:14.999 --> 00:52:16.767
"and molest people?"

1127
00:52:16.801 --> 00:52:18.936
-I was like. "Where the fuck
did your head go? No!"
-

1128
00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:21.472
"I'm doing it for $17
and a drink ticket."

1129
00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:24.074
Fucking weirdo.

1130
00:52:27.245 --> 00:52:28.813
And she was like.
"I'm not paying money

1131
00:52:28.846 --> 00:52:31.216
"for some faggot
to live in my house.

1132
00:52:31.216 --> 00:52:34.319
"to drive a car.
to go to school.

1133
00:52:34.352 --> 00:52:36.854
"You can get the fuck out
of my house."

1134
00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:39.990
Eighteen years old.
$17 in my pocket...

1135
00:52:40.024 --> 00:52:42.960
Well. I went to The Princess.
so I had $15.

1136
00:52:44.429 --> 00:52:45.430
I had a coffee.

1137
00:52:47.698 --> 00:52:50.868
So. there I am
in a parking lot.
in a grocery store.

1138
00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:52.237
crying my eyelashes off.

1139
00:52:52.237 --> 00:52:53.971
I took the car.
because I'm not dumb.

1140
00:52:55.606 --> 00:52:57.975
And I'm sitting there.
and I'm like. "This is it.

1141
00:52:58.008 --> 00:53:01.812
"How does the one person
who's supposed to love you.
no matter what.

1142
00:53:01.846 --> 00:53:04.482
"be like. 'Fuck you. Get out
of my fucking house. faggot.'

1143
00:53:04.515 --> 00:53:07.585
'I don't like you.
You're disgusting to me.'"

1144
00:53:07.618 --> 00:53:09.620
And I thought.
"There's nobody there for me.

1145
00:53:09.654 --> 00:53:15.360
"I'm not even there for me."
and I considered
just ending it all.

1146
00:53:16.093 --> 00:53:17.895
Like. I wanted to kill myself.

1147
00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:20.731
That was it.
I was... I had nothing.

1148
00:53:20.765 --> 00:53:23.668
I'm gay. I'm single.
I've got nothing to live for.

1149
00:53:24.835 --> 00:53:27.938
And as I sat there.
with my eyelashes
in my hands...

1150
00:53:29.274 --> 00:53:31.175
...I was peeling the glue off.

1151
00:53:31.276 --> 00:53:33.444
-Drag is expensive.
not gonna...
-

1152
00:53:33.478 --> 00:53:36.281
Reuse these
fucking things again.

1153
00:53:36.281 --> 00:53:38.182
And I was like.
"This is a metaphor for life."

1154
00:53:38.283 --> 00:53:40.318
You know. this is
a complete metaphor.

1155
00:53:41.986 --> 00:53:44.422
You know. you go through
a lot of shit.

1156
00:53:44.455 --> 00:53:46.491
And you get a lot of gunk
in your life.

1157
00:53:47.124 --> 00:53:49.294
But you peel it off.

1158
00:53:49.294 --> 00:53:52.563
and you put on
a new set of glue.
and you start a new day.

1159
00:53:53.197 --> 00:53:54.832
And that is my life.

1160
00:53:54.865 --> 00:53:58.035
I'm not just going to throw
this life away.
or these lashes away.

1161
00:53:58.068 --> 00:54:00.137
This is worth something.

1162
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:04.074
And this is what's
feeding me right now.

1163
00:54:04.108 --> 00:54:06.677
It's drag. It's not
just feeding my belly.

1164
00:54:06.711 --> 00:54:08.012
It's feeding my soul.

1165
00:54:08.045 --> 00:54:11.582
This is my life.
and I have to go on.

1166
00:54:11.616 --> 00:54:14.018
Yeah. you're going
to go through a lot of shit.

1167
00:54:14.051 --> 00:54:16.220
but shit
makes the flowers grow.

1168
00:54:27.565 --> 00:54:28.566
So...

1169
00:54:31.969 --> 00:54:34.238
Onyx and Rhoda
took me in.

1170
00:54:34.339 --> 00:54:36.374
and they let me sleep
on their couch.

1171
00:54:36.407 --> 00:54:39.410
And I was still finishing off
the semester at school.

1172
00:54:39.444 --> 00:54:42.580
And sometimes. I wake up
in the morning.
and be in full drag again.

1173
00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:44.482
and wouldn't realize
I was in full drag

1174
00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:47.117
'til I got...
Looked in the rearview mirror
of the car.

1175
00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:49.219
And they became my family.

1176
00:54:49.253 --> 00:54:50.988
They became my mother.

1177
00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:54.224
They became...You know.
I think that's why gay guys
love women so much.

1178
00:54:54.258 --> 00:54:56.226
because you sort of fill
a need for us.

1179
00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:57.728
You are mothering to us.

1180
00:54:57.762 --> 00:55:00.731
You help us. You help us
get our drunk asses
into the clubs.

1181
00:55:00.765 --> 00:55:02.767
and then out of the clubs
and into a cab.

1182
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.503
Or we ditch you
when we get
a Grindr hook-up. It's fine.

1183
00:55:05.536 --> 00:55:07.572
-You understand.

1184
00:55:08.272 --> 00:55:11.576
So. you know. I was like...

1185
00:55:11.609 --> 00:55:14.479
I had a new family.
and this is what we do.
as gays.

1186
00:55:14.512 --> 00:55:16.714
We find a new family
who become our family

1187
00:55:16.747 --> 00:55:19.750
and our support system.
and keep us moving on.

1188
00:55:19.784 --> 00:55:23.020
And now I'm. you know.
the black sheep of my family.

1189
00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:26.591
Until my 18-year-old sister
got pregnant.

1190
00:55:26.624 --> 00:55:28.493
-You know. so...
-

1191
00:55:28.526 --> 00:55:30.060
Like. "Whew.
teenage pregnancy."

1192
00:55:30.094 --> 00:55:32.763
And my mother was like.
"Oh my God.
now another one. Ugh.

1193
00:55:32.797 --> 00:55:34.264
"I've got to move
out of the country.

1194
00:55:34.298 --> 00:55:35.866
"My kids are embarrassing me.'

1195
00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:40.170
But my sisters.
my biological sisters.

1196
00:55:40.204 --> 00:55:42.573
they played a great part
in my life.

1197
00:55:42.607 --> 00:55:45.410
and helping my mom
really understand

1198
00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:48.278
what it is to love a child
who's gay.

1199
00:55:49.747 --> 00:55:51.849
My mother's like.
"Look. I'm a Catholic.

1200
00:55:51.882 --> 00:55:54.752
"I gotta bring these kids up
as Catholics.
as good Catholics.

1201
00:55:54.785 --> 00:55:56.554
"and let them know
what Christ is."

1202
00:55:57.655 --> 00:56:00.290
So. then one day.
my mother calls.

1203
00:56:00.324 --> 00:56:04.929
and she's like.
"I want you
to come to dinner.

1204
00:56:04.962 --> 00:56:06.196
"I want to talk to you.

1205
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:07.932
"I've been thinking about it.

1206
00:56:07.965 --> 00:56:11.602
"and I thought.
'I am a good Catholic.

1207
00:56:11.636 --> 00:56:13.671
'I should raise
Catholic children.

1208
00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:18.943
'But then I realized.
God has given me
these children

1209
00:56:18.976 --> 00:56:20.811
'to test my faith.

1210
00:56:20.845 --> 00:56:24.181
'To give me a gay child.
a divorced child.'

1211
00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:27.952
You know. 'A child
with a teenage pregnancy.
with a bastard baby.'"

1212
00:56:29.587 --> 00:56:31.121
I love my nephew. He's great.

1213
00:56:32.923 --> 00:56:38.195
But it helped her learn.
like. God gives you
what you can handle

1214
00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:40.698
and lets you learn. like...

1215
00:56:41.666 --> 00:56:43.300
"Your lesson's not done.

1216
00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:45.870
"There's something else
that you need to learn.
and it's about love.

1217
00:56:45.903 --> 00:56:48.673
"It's about true love.
unconditional love."

1218
00:56:48.706 --> 00:56:51.709
So. she said. "You know.
I want to thank you

1219
00:56:51.742 --> 00:56:54.979
"and I want
to thank your sisters.
'I love you no matter what."

1220
00:56:55.012 --> 00:56:57.047
And I was like. "Listen.
don't say 'No matter what.'

1221
00:56:57.081 --> 00:56:59.584
"because. 'No matter what'
seems like. you know.
you could be a killer

1222
00:56:59.617 --> 00:57:01.686
"and. 'no matter what...' Yeah.

1223
00:57:01.719 --> 00:57:04.655
"I want you to say.
'I love you and thank you

1224
00:57:04.689 --> 00:57:07.391
'for showing me
who you really are
as a person.

1225
00:57:07.492 --> 00:57:10.828
'That's what I'm so honored
to see who you really are.'"

1226
00:57:13.363 --> 00:57:14.999
So. she invited me to dinner.

1227
00:57:15.032 --> 00:57:18.569
So. we go to dinner.
and she's like.
"Look. it's the '80s.

1228
00:57:18.603 --> 00:57:20.805
"I'm very worried
you might get the AIDS."

1229
00:57:21.772 --> 00:57:23.173
You know parents. "The AIDS."

1230
00:57:24.108 --> 00:57:27.645
"And so. I'm just.
you know. worried."

1231
00:57:27.678 --> 00:57:29.914
I'm like. "I don't even do.
like. risky behavior.

1232
00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:31.649
"Like. yet."
I wasn't doing anal.

1233
00:57:33.518 --> 00:57:35.419
And she's like.
"What else is there?"

1234
00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:39.790
So. then I had to explain
gay intimacy to her.

1235
00:57:39.824 --> 00:57:42.760
I'm like. "Well.
there's rubbing.
and touching. and kissing.

1236
00:57:42.793 --> 00:57:44.194
"and. you know. oral."

1237
00:57:45.796 --> 00:57:47.765
"Oral?

1238
00:57:47.798 --> 00:57:50.701
-"In your mouth? Oh. my God!
-

1239
00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:52.603
"That's sodomy!

1240
00:57:52.637 --> 00:57:56.206
"I love your father.
but I could never. Ugh!"

1241
00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.442
I was like.
"You've never sucked
Dad's dick?"

1242
00:57:59.977 --> 00:58:02.847
-My dad was like.
" No."
-

1243
00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.715
I was like. "Oh. my God.
but you're Catholic.

1244
00:58:04.749 --> 00:58:07.585
"Catholic girls are supposed
to not get pregnant.
They just suck dick."

1245
00:58:09.554 --> 00:58:10.888
Dad was very sad.

1246
00:58:12.256 --> 00:58:13.691
The waiter was very confused.

1247
00:58:15.459 --> 00:58:17.828
But you're there.
you're like family.

1248
00:58:18.729 --> 00:58:21.231
"More breadsticks.
please. Thank you."

1249
00:58:21.265 --> 00:58:25.570
So. we got to a place
of. like.
"Don't ask. don't tell."

1250
00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:27.872
and. you know.
it worked out fine for us.

1251
00:58:27.905 --> 00:58:29.907
So. we repaired
this relationship.

1252
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:31.576
and it's so great
that she learned

1253
00:58:31.576 --> 00:58:34.812
how to be a good Christian.
so. I'm very thankful
for that.

1254
00:58:41.285 --> 00:58:45.890
So. then it was the '90s.
and RuPaul was on the radio.

1255
00:58:45.923 --> 00:58:47.592
* You better work

1256
00:58:47.592 --> 00:58:50.595
And I did.
I used those lashes
over. and over. and over.

1257
00:58:50.595 --> 00:58:52.797
-I still have them on.
-

1258
00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:54.599
$4.99 a pair.

1259
00:58:55.766 --> 00:58:57.768
And my dad was like.
"That RuPaul's
kind of pretty."

1260
00:58:57.802 --> 00:59:00.270
I'm like. "Are you sure
I'm not the only fruit?"

1261
00:59:02.607 --> 00:59:04.474
So. yeah. So. RuPaul
was on the radio.

1262
00:59:04.508 --> 00:59:06.644
and I was continuing
to do drag.

1263
00:59:06.677 --> 00:59:08.145
and then. one day.
I was so lucky

1264
00:59:08.178 --> 00:59:10.615
to be on RuPaul's Drag Race.
season six.

1265
00:59:12.249 --> 00:59:13.250
Thank you.

1266
00:59:14.852 --> 00:59:16.186
Spoiler alert.

1267
00:59:17.688 --> 00:59:21.158
I mean. come on.
I didn't win. I didn't win.

1268
00:59:21.191 --> 00:59:24.394
I didn't win. but that
has not stopped me
from traveling the world

1269
00:59:24.428 --> 00:59:28.432
and making huge impressions
in hotel mattresses
around the world.

1270
00:59:31.035 --> 00:59:32.637
So. people are always
asking me. like.

1271
00:59:32.637 --> 00:59:35.339
"What's it like to be
on RuPaul's Drag Race?"
I'm like. "Torture."

1272
00:59:36.807 --> 00:59:38.408
So. they take you from the...

1273
00:59:38.442 --> 00:59:41.278
The hotel... Like.
they take you to a hotel.
from the airport.

1274
00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:42.880
They take your phone
away from you.

1275
00:59:42.913 --> 00:59:44.548
No contact
with the outside world.

1276
00:59:44.649 --> 00:59:48.218
They rip the phones
out of the wall in the hotel.
There's no DVR.

1277
00:59:50.387 --> 00:59:52.657
They don't let you talk
to the other
contestants either.

1278
00:59:52.657 --> 00:59:54.659
because. you know.
they don't want
to have you. like.

1279
00:59:54.659 --> 00:59:56.393
have a fight on camera.

1280
00:59:56.426 --> 00:59:57.728
and then make up off-camera.

1281
00:59:57.762 --> 01:00:01.031
and then walk in the workroom.
like. "Hi. we're friends."

1282
01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:03.033
'cause the audience
will be. like.
"What the fuck?"

1283
01:00:03.067 --> 01:00:05.102
So. they put you in a room.

1284
01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:07.371
They sequester you.
they lock the door.

1285
01:00:07.404 --> 01:00:09.640
They put a piece of tape
over the door...

1286
01:00:09.674 --> 01:00:11.075
Seriously. They don't want
you leaving.

1287
01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.409
You break the seal.
and they know.

1288
01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.645
Thanks Willam.
for ruining it for everybody.

1289
01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:20.050
Willam used to go out.
and get a little... Anyway...

1290
01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:21.786
So. they put you in the room.

1291
01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:23.888
They give you. like.
a big bowl of snacks

1292
01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:26.056
and a big. thick thing
of note paper.

1293
01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:28.592
and like.
if you need anything.
just write a note.

1294
01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.360
and slide it under the door.

1295
01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:34.665
And in the first hour.
I ran out of note paper.

1296
01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:38.102
I was like.
"More snacks."

1297
01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:44.909
"More hotel lotion."

1298
01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:51.215
Because. you know.
I was doing...

1299
01:00:52.216 --> 01:00:54.618
I was doing my delicates
by hand.

1300
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.756
Actually. it was more like
roughing up
the fucking witness.

1301
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.526
I was playing
Good Cop. Bad Cop
with my fucking dick.

1302
01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:05.730
"Tell me what you know!"

1303
01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:09.834
"Spit it out."

1304
01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:12.602
"Spit it out.
Spit it  out!"

1305
01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:25.415
"More fresh towels."

1306
01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:45.435
Got 'em.

1307
01:01:47.772 --> 01:01:49.774
All right. I got it. Thank you.

1308
01:01:49.774 --> 01:01:51.375
Thank you. Jesus.

1309
01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:52.910
Oh. my God. I'm bending over
in a corset.

1310
01:01:52.943 --> 01:01:55.045
I swear to God. my balls
are going to pop out.

1311
01:01:55.079 --> 01:01:57.114
-

1312
01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:58.949
But the hotel
was very nice. though.

1313
01:01:58.983 --> 01:02:01.651
It had one of those fancy
espresso machines.

1314
01:02:02.286 --> 01:02:03.788
but it broke in my suitcase.

1315
01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:07.257
Should have wrapped it
in more towels.

1316
01:02:08.592 --> 01:02:11.161
But I've been really lucky.
though. to travel
and perform.

1317
01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:12.562
It's been fantastic.

1318
01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:15.299
It's really led to some
amazing opportunities

1319
01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:17.134
for a lot
of the other contestants.

1320
01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:23.040
-OnlyFans. apparently.
-

1321
01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.708
Have you seen it?
Some of the girls. I mean...

1322
01:02:24.809 --> 01:02:27.077
They do a lot of porn.

1323
01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:29.146
And I've got to say.
it matches their drag.

1324
01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:31.215
-Average.
-

1325
01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:36.320
So. I've been...
I was so lucky to fly

1326
01:02:36.353 --> 01:02:39.589
to Puerto Vallarta. Mexico.
and do a show down there.

1327
01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:42.893
-Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you.
-

1328
01:02:42.927 --> 01:02:46.263
So beautiful.
Yeah. so fantastic.

1329
01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:49.699
And I'm not going
to fat-shame anybody.
because I'm fat.

1330
01:02:49.733 --> 01:02:53.270
but the flight attendant.
she kept bumping
my shoulder

1331
01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:54.839
every time she'd go by.

1332
01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.507
I was at a window seat.

1333
01:03:01.145 --> 01:03:03.013
I'm a big girl. too.

1334
01:03:03.047 --> 01:03:06.951
And then she had the audacity
to give me one bag of pretzels

1335
01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:09.019
that was. like.
I flipped it over.
100 calories.

1336
01:03:09.053 --> 01:03:12.156
I was like. "Are you...
"That's enough to piss me
the fuck off.

1337
01:03:14.158 --> 01:03:16.360
Then I look on the back.
it says. "14 grams."

1338
01:03:17.962 --> 01:03:19.663
Honey. I've snorted
more than that.

1339
01:03:19.696 --> 01:03:22.099
-Fourteen grams.

1340
01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:24.434
Those fucking seats.
Tight as fuck.

1341
01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:27.704
My leg keeps hitting
the fucking recline button
by accident.

1342
01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:31.008
Like. "Could you...
Sir. could you..." "Sir."

1343
01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:32.977
"Could you put your seat up?"

1344
01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:34.945
I'm like. "I'm trying."

1345
01:03:34.979 --> 01:03:39.716
So. anyway. then I saw
this advertisement
for the Comfort Plus.

1346
01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:42.619
"Hey. why don't you upgrade
to Comfort Plus.

1347
01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:46.156
"and get
a little more elbow room
for your knees?"

1348
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:49.126
How about a little more
fucking elbow room
for my goddamn elbows?

1349
01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:51.128
-Jesus Christ!
-

1350
01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.696
So. we're going
to Puerto Velveeta...

1351
01:03:54.698 --> 01:03:58.035
...and we had
a little downtime
before we did our show.

1352
01:03:58.068 --> 01:04:00.137
And so. we're lying
on the beach.

1353
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:05.910
It's beautiful. It's gorgeous.
Sun's out. guns out. and...

1354
01:04:05.943 --> 01:04:07.978
And the vendors come up.
and they're like.

1355
01:04:08.012 --> 01:04:10.480
"Hey. senorita.
how are you today?"

1356
01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:14.451
That's my accent
from Mexico. Thank you.

1357
01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:17.454
-Getting canceled today.
-

1358
01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:18.923
"Senorita.  hi."

1359
01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:22.292
Would you like a sombrero?
I was like. "No. I'm good."

1360
01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:24.394
"You're pasty.
you'll get burned."

1361
01:04:24.428 --> 01:04:26.063
I was like.
"No. I'm good. Okay?"

1362
01:04:26.096 --> 01:04:27.264
"Would you like
some jewelry?"

1363
01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:28.398
"No. I'm cool. Cool."

1364
01:04:28.432 --> 01:04:30.935
"A scarf?" "No. I'm cool."

1365
01:04:30.968 --> 01:04:32.336
"Cocaine?"

1366
01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.504
-Wow. that was a jump.

1367
01:04:36.974 --> 01:04:38.108
"I'll take two scarves."

1368
01:04:42.346 --> 01:04:46.616
No. like...
I don't like cocaine.
but I love the way it smells.

1369
01:04:47.952 --> 01:04:50.087
Ah!

1370
01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.822
When I'm getting bare-backed
in a bathroom stall...

1371
01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:55.492
"Cocaine smells great."

1372
01:04:57.995 --> 01:05:02.099
Actually. most days.
I'm kind of like
a gay Muslim. Stoned.

1373
01:05:03.968 --> 01:05:06.103
Hey. I'm not the one
throwing people
off buildings.

1374
01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:07.204
That's them.

1375
01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:10.374
So. yeah. Phew. It got dark.

1376
01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:12.076
-Horrible.

1377
01:05:12.977 --> 01:05:15.345
So then. we're walking
down there.

1378
01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:16.981
walking down the walkway
and stuff.

1379
01:05:16.981 --> 01:05:20.017
and the boardwalk.
and they're like. "Hey. hey."

1380
01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.252
and you see the guys
outside the pharmacies.

1381
01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:24.221
and he's like.
"We have diet pills."

1382
01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:30.227
How fucking rude! Rude!

1383
01:05:30.995 --> 01:05:31.895
Two boxes.

1384
01:05:31.996 --> 01:05:34.698
-I'll take two.

1385
01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:36.900
Three. They are great.
by the way.

1386
01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:39.769
They work great. I'm sweating
like two rats fucking
in a wool sock.

1387
01:05:39.803 --> 01:05:41.238
-All right.
-

1388
01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:44.374
So. there was
a really beautiful boy.

1389
01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:45.709
His name was Cesar.

1390
01:05:45.742 --> 01:05:47.577
And he's like. "Do you want
to go scuba diving?

1391
01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:50.014
"I'll take you. We'll take you
on a scuba diving ride."

1392
01:05:50.014 --> 01:05:53.250
My friend's like. "No.
This is where
they fucking take you

1393
01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.718
"to the fucking.
like. outskirts.

1394
01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:57.621
"they cut you open.
they sell your organs."

1395
01:05:57.654 --> 01:05:59.556
I'm like.
"What are you gonna do
with my fucking organs?"

1396
01:05:59.589 --> 01:06:01.791
Like. sell them
as an after-photo?

1397
01:06:01.825 --> 01:06:04.694
Like. no. my kidneys
and liver are shot.

1398
01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:09.033
So... "No.
they could bury you
in a shallow grave."

1399
01:06:09.933 --> 01:06:11.335
Honey. it's going
to take him all day

1400
01:06:11.368 --> 01:06:14.638
to dig a fucking hole
to put me in a shallow grave.

1401
01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:16.206
-I'm a big bitch.

1402
01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.376
So. I tell you...
And I'm still in the heels.
Thank you.

1403
01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:22.179
I'm waiting for them
to be ground down to flats
in a minute.

1404
01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:23.547
All right. so...

1405
01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:27.584
But seriously. the ocean
is fucking scary. dude.
It's vast.

1406
01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:29.819
And. like. the sharks...

1407
01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:34.091
Ugh. Like. my biggest fear
of being half-eaten
by a shark.

1408
01:06:34.124 --> 01:06:36.693
is I'd still be 20 pounds
over my goal weight.

1409
01:06:38.195 --> 01:06:40.930
So... No. actually.
I'm more terrified
of dolphins

1410
01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:43.100
because. I don't know
if you guys know
about dolphins.

1411
01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:47.071
but. you know.
they get a little frisky.

1412
01:06:47.104 --> 01:06:49.173
They don't know
that "No" means. .

1413
01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:54.178
And. of course. if it's...
You know. gets you pregnant

1414
01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:57.181
and it's past the guppy stage.
and you live in Oklahoma
or Texas.

1415
01:06:57.214 --> 01:06:59.316
-you've got to keep it.
-

1416
01:07:00.284 --> 01:07:02.286
Please fucking vote. Anyway...

1417
01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:04.754
So. Cesar is like.
"I'll take you on a scuba dive."

1418
01:07:04.788 --> 01:07:06.290
I was like. "Okay. great."

1419
01:07:06.323 --> 01:07:10.594
So. he gives me a vest
in XXX. I'm like.
"Okay. thank you."

1420
01:07:10.627 --> 01:07:13.763
So. there I am.
trying to buckle the thing.
I'm like.  "God."

1421
01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:15.932
And I've got my white
swim shirt on.

1422
01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:17.534
and I'm buckling
this black vest

1423
01:07:17.567 --> 01:07:20.304
over my fucking belly.

1424
01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:23.207
Black vest. white shirt.

1425
01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.374
I looked like Shamu.

1426
01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:29.313
So. we get into the water
and I float like soap.

1427
01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:33.950
I'm like ivory soap.
just 99.44% pure evil.

1428
01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:36.486
And so he's like. ploop.

1429
01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:42.959
And then he said
the sweetest thing to me.

1430
01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:46.363
Cesar turns to me
and he's like.
"You need to be heavier."

1431
01:07:48.031 --> 01:07:49.166
Thank you.

1432
01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:51.735
Thank you! I do!

1433
01:07:53.036 --> 01:07:55.139
I need
to be heavier.

1434
01:07:55.139 --> 01:07:57.707
So. he throws
a weight belt on me.

1435
01:07:57.741 --> 01:08:01.478
Bloop. So. he throws
the anchor on me. Bloop.
And I finally sink.

1436
01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:06.049
And so. we get down there.
and it's just beautiful.
just gorgeous.

1437
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:08.485
I'm swimming around
like the little sperm maid.

1438
01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:17.794
I want to be
where the people aren't.

1439
01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:23.300
So. we have a great time.
scuba diving and stuff.
and then we get up there.

1440
01:08:23.333 --> 01:08:24.968
And apparently.
there was a hurricane

1441
01:08:25.001 --> 01:08:28.905
that was coming. and so.
the water was a'churnin'.

1442
01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.007
Like my eggs Benedict
from that mornin'.

1443
01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.443
-Just a'churnin'.

1444
01:08:33.477 --> 01:08:36.280
And then. like. "Okay.
get back up on the boat."

1445
01:08:36.313 --> 01:08:39.416
So. he grabs the metal ladder
and throws it down.

1446
01:08:39.449 --> 01:08:42.586
And the boat's doing this.
and the ladder's doing this.

1447
01:08:42.619 --> 01:08:44.188
He's like. "Grab on."

1448
01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:46.556
I'm like. "Fuck."

1449
01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.459
So. this metal ladder.
I'm trying to...

1450
01:08:52.196 --> 01:08:56.099
"Oh my God. I've got
no strength left. Holy crap."

1451
01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.535
So. my hands
and legs are sliding
through the fucking thing.

1452
01:08:58.568 --> 01:09:01.205
I'm getting grated
like I'm a goddamn potato
on a mandolin.

1453
01:09:01.238 --> 01:09:02.806
-I'm like. "Jesus."
-

1454
01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:04.408
"I'm gonna fall."

1455
01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:08.011
Then I feel Cesar's hands
on my ass.
I'm like. "Not now."

1456
01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:13.550
-Now. he wants a tossed
Cesar salad. Oh!
-

1457
01:09:13.583 --> 01:09:16.853
He was like.
"I'm trying to give you a push.
gringa puerca."

1458
01:09:18.588 --> 01:09:21.625
Which... I don't
speak Spanish. but I think
that means "Pretty lady."

1459
01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:26.363
I'm trying to grab on.
and I have no strength left.

1460
01:09:26.396 --> 01:09:29.766
Like. I couldn't slap the shit
out of a colostomy bag.

1461
01:09:31.301 --> 01:09:33.270
So. I finally get a leg up
on the fucking thing.

1462
01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:34.971
He's got his hands on my ass.

1463
01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:38.275
.
it bucks me
into the fucking air.

1464
01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:41.077
I go flying
through the fucking air.

1465
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:42.979
I'm like. "Whoa!"

1466
01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:46.583
-In my black vest
and white... Like Free Willy.
-

1467
01:09:46.616 --> 01:09:50.587
I feel a little boy
eating a bag of kettle corn

1468
01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.055
just rub my belly

1469
01:09:52.088 --> 01:09:56.560
as I fly through the air
on top of him. Splat!

1470
01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:59.829
I land on the boat.
the boat goes. .

1471
01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:01.298
start sliding down.

1472
01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:04.000
The captain goes.
"We're going to need
a bigger boat."

1473
01:10:07.804 --> 01:10:09.639
And I finally make it up
onto the boat.

1474
01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:11.241
.

1475
01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:18.081
The gasoline and salt water
has made it down
into my eggs Benny.

1476
01:10:18.114 --> 01:10:20.116
I was like.
.

1477
01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:25.655
I see that little boy's bag
of kettle corn.

1478
01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:28.658
snatch it out of his hand.

1479
01:10:32.496 --> 01:10:36.132
And the first thing you do
after you puke is breathe in.

1480
01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:49.579
Kettle corn touched my face
with puke.

1481
01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:53.617
Isn't it lovely.

1482
01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:56.720
-I'm still single by the way.
Thank you.
-

1483
01:10:56.753 --> 01:11:00.390
Ugh. I'm worn out. dehydrated.
half down. handicapped
at this point.

1484
01:11:00.424 --> 01:11:03.393
and I'm like.
"Oh my God." crying.

1485
01:11:03.427 --> 01:11:05.329
"Somebody give me
a cigarette."

1486
01:11:05.329 --> 01:11:06.563
And a bump of cocaine.

1487
01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:09.666
So. we get back

1488
01:11:10.334 --> 01:11:12.168
to the dock. I'm like...

1489
01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:17.106
"Are those nachos?"

1490
01:11:22.346 --> 01:11:24.047
I wasn't crying. I was...

1491
01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.882
-Nachos.
-

1492
01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:28.418
So. as I sat there
eating the nachos.
I was like.

1493
01:11:28.452 --> 01:11:31.988
"Man. I've got
to take better care
of my fucking self."

1494
01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:34.558
You know. that's...
I mean...

1495
01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:38.428
I'm going to be 50. last year.
and...

1496
01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:43.367
Thank you.

1497
01:11:47.371 --> 01:11:50.407
So. I decided.
"I'm going to go
to that gym.

1498
01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.975
"and I'm going to.
you know..."

1499
01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:53.443
Like. I went to the gym
four times.

1500
01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:56.279
Last week.

1501
01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:58.014
But I couldn't find
a parking spot close enough.

1502
01:11:58.047 --> 01:11:59.483
-No. no.

1503
01:11:59.516 --> 01:12:01.184
I actually decided.
"I'm paying
for this membership.

1504
01:12:01.217 --> 01:12:03.787
"I'm going to go."
I got myself a personal
terrorist... Uh. trainer.

1505
01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:07.857
And I've lost some weight.

1506
01:12:11.728 --> 01:12:13.497
People are like.
"How much did you lose?"

1507
01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:17.000
"We've seen
your transformation.
How much did you lose?"

1508
01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:21.170
And actually. like...
Almost
200 pounds.

1509
01:12:21.204 --> 01:12:23.640
-know.

1510
01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.742
I'm still fat. It's cool.

1511
01:12:25.775 --> 01:12:27.511
Um. but that's not it.

1512
01:12:27.544 --> 01:12:30.747
It's not about what you lose.
It's about what you gain.

1513
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.281
I have gained strength.

1514
01:12:32.315 --> 01:12:33.950
I have gained flexibility.

1515
01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:40.023
I can now sit on my dick.

1516
01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:43.560
Squat down. and get in it.

1517
01:12:44.828 --> 01:12:46.029
Did I put panties on?

1518
01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:50.700
I have gained my flexibility.
my energy. my life back.

1519
01:12:50.734 --> 01:12:53.202
And that is what
I'm so truly happy about it.

1520
01:12:56.339 --> 01:12:58.475
It's not about the number
on the fucking scale.

1521
01:12:58.508 --> 01:13:01.144
It's about what you give.
what you get in life.

1522
01:13:01.177 --> 01:13:02.646
That's what I feel better about.

1523
01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:06.950
I can continue
to now get on my knees.
and praise Jesus.

1524
01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:08.652
-And...
-

1525
01:13:08.685 --> 01:13:12.456
But I also gained
the cheddar
and sour cream chips.

1526
01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:16.460
I have made it.

1527
01:13:16.493 --> 01:13:19.463
And that's the thing. too.
It's like. I've been fat
my whole fucking life.

1528
01:13:19.463 --> 01:13:22.466
And I was like. "Uh.
you know. maybe this is...

1529
01:13:22.466 --> 01:13:23.867
"This is just me. Whatever."

1530
01:13:24.568 --> 01:13:25.735
And it's fine to be fat.

1531
01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:28.638
But it's so important
to be strong.

1532
01:13:28.672 --> 01:13:30.640
and be able to get off
the floor when you can.

1533
01:13:30.674 --> 01:13:32.476
You know. like.
I don't want to be...

1534
01:13:32.509 --> 01:13:33.977
Because my parents
are getting old.

1535
01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:35.645
They're getting to that.
they fall
on the fucking floor.

1536
01:13:35.679 --> 01:13:37.847
they never get up. "Help.
I've fallen. I can't get up."

1537
01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:41.150
Which we think is funny.
But when you're lying
there. embarrassed.

1538
01:13:41.184 --> 01:13:44.654
in a Walmart parking lot.
you know. it's not so great.

1539
01:13:44.688 --> 01:13:46.923
So. it's about taking care
of yourself

1540
01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:48.658
and having that.

1541
01:13:48.692 --> 01:13:50.226
I don't want to be a burden
on anybody.

1542
01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:53.362
So. I'm like.
"Let me take care of myself
and get stronger."

1543
01:13:53.396 --> 01:13:56.533
And I honestly
did not think I could do it.

1544
01:13:57.501 --> 01:13:59.669
But then I thought
about bumblebees.

1545
01:13:59.703 --> 01:14:02.606
And I don't know if you know
the story about bumblebees.

1546
01:14:02.639 --> 01:14:05.609
Their wings are really small
for their big. fat bodies.

1547
01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:10.880
According to physics.
bumblebees should not fly.

1548
01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:13.182
but they do.

1549
01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:16.119
They defy physics. and they fly.

1550
01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:19.422
They take their fat
little bodies.
and they put all their heart

1551
01:14:19.523 --> 01:14:22.258
and energy into it.
and they can fly.

1552
01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:31.935
So. as I stand up here.
still in heels...

1553
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:37.040
...I want you to know
that if I can fucking do it.

1554
01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:38.441
anybody can do it.

1555
01:14:38.542 --> 01:14:41.044
I know that all of you can fly.

1556
01:14:41.077 --> 01:14:42.546
I believe in all of you.

1557
01:14:42.546 --> 01:14:44.714
My sisters. my misters.

1558
01:14:44.748 --> 01:14:47.116
my girls. my gays
and my theys.

1559
01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:50.654
I want you to go out there
and attack every fucking world.

1560
01:14:50.687 --> 01:14:53.557
And remember. when shit
gets you down. pull it off.

1561
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.291
and remember
tomorrow is a new day.

1562
01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:59.896
Bat those fuckin eyelashes
and fly your fat ass
to the goddamn sun.

1563
01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:02.131
-loveyou.

1564
01:15:02.165 --> 01:15:03.399
Thank you for being here.

1565
01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:07.036
-Big kisses from the big girl.

1566
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:08.071
Muah!

1567
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:20.950
* I'm pushing hard
But even then it's all I got

1568
01:15:20.984 --> 01:15:24.821
* I won't stop...
Till I'm 'bout to.
'bout to die

1569
01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:28.592
* It's not just me
I know it's you and I

1570
01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:32.395
* Together we
Together we can fly

1571
01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:36.232
* La. la. la. la. la
La. la. la. la. la

1572
01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:40.003
* La. la. la. la. la
Together we can fly. fly

1573
01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:43.907
* La. la. la. la. la
La. la. la. la. la

1574
01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.911
* La. la. la. la. la
La. la. la. la. la

1575
01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:50.980
* La. la. la. la. la
Together we can fly *
