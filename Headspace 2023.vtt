3
00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:51.958
Hey. I'm Norman.

4
00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:54.458
That's not me exactly.

5
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.541
It's just a horrible drawing
of me. done by me.

6
00:00:58.083 --> 00:01:00.208
Anyways. I'm here
trying to think of

7
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.541
an idea for my science
presentation.

8
00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.416
Maybe I'll do it on satellites.

9
00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:08.666
or the habitation
of other planets.

10
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.458
Or I could do it on the evidence

11
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.458
of extraterrestrial life.

12
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:18.291
Or maybe I'll just do it
about Charlene.

13
00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:23.375
She's this girl I like.
Man. is she beautiful.

14
00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.208
No. no really. she is.

15
00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:28.458
Don't let my terrible drawing
skills fool you.

16
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.791
Uh. back to the
actual task at hand.

17
00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:33.958
I think I'm going to
do the presentation

18
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.250
about life on other planets.

19
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.583
Yeah. because. in my opinion.
aliens are our only hope

20
00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:41.416
of fixing the mess we've
gotten the world into.

21
00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:44.958
No. really. hear me out!

22
00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:47.875
Aliens are super smart. Fact.

23
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.333
Ever read a comic
about a dumb alien?

24
00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:53.166
I like comics too by the way.
not sure if I mentioned that.

25
00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:55.000
Uh. yeah. right.

26
00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:57.500
But what is the problem
of global warming

27
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:00.166
to the advanced technology
of aliens?

28
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.833
But I guess the only question is
would they want to help us?

29
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:06.041
once they get here?

30
00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:09.500
Well. my opinion.
I guess they would.

31
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:11.250
Or at least I think I
could convince them.

32
00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:12.666
While you're in fairy tale land

33
00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:14.833
convincing aliens to
save our planet.

34
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:16.791
Somebody's got to
stop the government

35
00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:18.083
from blowing them
out of the sky!

36
00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.708
Virgil!

37
00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:22.208
You know they got that

38
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.583
extra-terrestrial
defense system. right?

39
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.291
Yeah. yeah. I know.

40
00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:28.500
I've heard
all your conspiracies.

41
00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:30.458
but my theory is scientific.

42
00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:33.333
Well. science is totally
my thing.

43
00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:37.125
Hey dude.
shouldn't you get going?

44
00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:38.583
Tuesdays are a school night.

45
00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:41.416
It's actually Wednesday.

46
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:44.500
Wait. what?
Oh. far out.

47
00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:47.083
Anyway. I still have to decide
on the title

48
00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.750
for the group presentation
tomorrow.

49
00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:53.416
I mean. you know there's
got to be life on other planets.

50
00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.666
Well. why don't you
just go with that one?

51
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:02.583
Speak from the heart. Norman.
Speak from the heart.

52
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.916
Okay. guys. you ready?

53
00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:37.000
We're only going to get
one shot at this.

54
00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:40.166
So let's run through our plan
one last time.

55
00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:44.750
First. we go in stealthy.
and plant the disruptor device.

56
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.708
Check!

57
00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:49.333
Before Zolthard can discharge
his mind manipulator.

58
00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:52.250
on those helpless little
Erdorian creatures.

59
00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:55.416
Next. we get out of there
as fast as possible.

60
00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:58.000
without getting blown to bits.
of course.

61
00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:00.875
And we take this wormhole.
not that one

62
00:04:00.916 --> 00:04:02.833
to the nearest
Galactic Safe Zone

63
00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.458
and disappear without a trace.

64
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:09.458
Mission completed.
Zolthard defeated.

65
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.416
Why not throw in
a nice promotion for you

66
00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:12.291
while you're at it?

67
00:04:12.458 --> 00:04:14.166
I'm glad you brought it up.

68
00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:17.458
And after the ceremony. we'll
take a well-deserved break.

69
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.958
on a tropical island planet
somewhere.

70
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.541
You wish!

71
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.583
Are we all on the same page?

72
00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:24.791
Let's do this.

73
00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:27.500
Gus. take us into stealth mode.

74
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.833
Okay.

75
00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:31.750
Going dark.

76
00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:41.166
If Zolthard takes control of the
Erdorian High Council.

77
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:43.833
that's it
for the entire universe.

78
00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:45.625
Initializing approach sequence.

79
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:48.375
Remind me again why we were
assigned this ship.

80
00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:49.833
We don't have much choice.

81
00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:52.583
This is the only ship
in the fleet small enough

82
00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.541
to evade Zolthard’s detection.

83
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.333
This thing is huge.

84
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.041
Put us down close
to one of those pylons.

85
00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:13.666
We can try to gain access
through the maintenance panel.

86
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.625
Okay. Sophie.
take us down!

87
00:05:19.416 --> 00:05:20.666
This better work.

88
00:05:32.208 --> 00:05:34.083
Can any of you tell me why

89
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:37.041
we haven't taken control
of this planet yet?

90
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:40.333
Sir. the mind manipulator
has been initialized.

91
00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:43.166
Let's get on
with the invasion then.

92
00:05:43.583 --> 00:05:45.708
Activating Pylon One.

93
00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:46.875
Whagh!

94
00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:47.541
Sir.

95
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:48.958
What!

96
00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:51.000
Pylon One online.

97
00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:52.958
Engage!

98
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:54.791
Activating Pylon Two.

99
00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.750
Mindless metal!

100
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.291
Sir. the planet has
deployed its defensive systems.

101
00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:10.250
Well. that's not
going to save them.

102
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.791
Hurry up. Sophie.

103
00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:23.625
They're almost done with
the start-up sequence.

104
00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:25.375
Activating Pylon Three.

105
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.166
At last!

106
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.125
Activating Pylon Four.

107
00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:40.208
Hagh! Hagh!
How many pylons are there?

108
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:43.750
Pylon Four online.

109
00:06:46.166 --> 00:06:48.125
Sophie. keep the
power flow open

110
00:06:48.166 --> 00:06:49.416
once the connection is made.

111
00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:52.708
and make sure you give yourself
enough time to get away.

112
00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:53.666
Copy.

113
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.208
We're running out of time!

114
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:01.375
I just need a few more seconds.

115
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:04.750
Pylon Five online.

116
00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.083
Fire!

117
00:07:31.416 --> 00:07:33.583
Yeagh!!

118
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.041
Max!

119
00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:44.250
Those pesky peace keepers!

120
00:07:44.916 --> 00:07:48.166
Someone better
explain this to me!

121
00:07:48.416 --> 00:07:51.708
Zolthard Sir.
at least their ship is damaged.

122
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:52.083
We can dispatch...

123
00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:56.958
Now. this time
I'll take care of it myself.

124
00:07:57.333 --> 00:07:59.333
Ready my personal ship!

125
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:01.250
Sir. yes. Sir.

126
00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:19.041
These peace keepers will learn
the meaning of war.

127
00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:20.791
Crush them!

128
00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:22.083
We're not in range.

129
00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:24.958
Aargh! Mother of tentacles!

130
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:28.583
Always at the mercy
of mindless metal.

131
00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:34.500
All stations prepare
for my imminent return!

132
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:37.125
My final victory over these

133
00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:40.416
officials of incompetence
is at hand!

134
00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:45.333
And then we will
resume the invasion.

135
00:08:50.583 --> 00:08:51.708
Whoa!

136
00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:01.375
How far is it to this wormhole?

137
00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:02.958
There's no way
we're going to make it.

138
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.666
-Hold this!
-Gus!

139
00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.541
There is another option.

140
00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:08.333
What are you talking about?

141
00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:11.291
The Hole of the Lost.

142
00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:12.708
Are you out of your mind?

143
00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:16.583
The wormhole
is strictly off limits!

144
00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:19.500
Anyone who's ever gone down
that hole. has never returned.

145
00:09:19.541 --> 00:09:20.541
I don't think we have a choice.

146
00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:23.125
The chief will kill me if
anything happens to the ship.

147
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:26.458
Guys. if we take
one more hit. we'll be toast!

148
00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:30.041
-What the?
-Gus!

149
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.208
Vengeance is mine!

150
00:09:32.416 --> 00:09:33.416
I can fix this.

151
00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:34.916
If I reroute the
ship's power from the

152
00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.250
trash compactor
unit to the auxiliary--

153
00:09:36.291 --> 00:09:39.000
Whatever you're going to do.
do it now!

154
00:09:39.041 --> 00:09:40.166
Okay!

155
00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:47.916
That's more like it.

156
00:09:49.791 --> 00:09:51.000
Hang on!

157
00:09:54.791 --> 00:09:57.041
Oh no. they're almost on us!

158
00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:03.916
We are now in range. Sir.

159
00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.916
Open the
communications frequency.

160
00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:09.916
Incoming transmission from
Zolthard's ship?

161
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:11.416
Put him on the screen.

162
00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:15.833
Surrender!
Or I will pulverize you!

163
00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:18.500
Zolthard! We both know
how this ends.

164
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:20.458
Can you believe how big
that head is?

165
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.958
Yeah. I know. It's huge.

166
00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:24.125
You think this is funny?

167
00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:26.041
Let's see what you think
about this!

168
00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:32.416
Huh! Phaser beam!

169
00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:40.291
Well. I refuse to just sit here

170
00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:42.875
while Zolthard takes
shots at us.

171
00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:45.166
Where are you going?
Argh!

172
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.958
To do something crazy. probably.

173
00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:54.666
I'm detecting debris
coming off the other ship.

174
00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:58.041
What is that?

175
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.250
And that boys. is how it's done.

176
00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:15.833
Good job. Sophie.

177
00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:19.500
Gus. how far are we from that
Hole of the Lost?

178
00:11:19.541 --> 00:11:21.250
We're entering
the gravity field!

179
00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:23.958
I just hope this ship
can hold it together...

180
00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:26.208
Because here goes nothing.

181
00:11:30.916 --> 00:11:33.458
You fools! They're getting away!

182
00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:35.041
Caution. If we follow them.

183
00:11:35.083 --> 00:11:37.625
we'll lose communication
with the Mothership.

184
00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:40.625
I don't care!
After that ship!

185
00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:03.375
Norman!

186
00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:11.875
Norman!

187
00:12:11.916 --> 00:12:14.083
You're going to
miss the bus again.

188
00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:15.708
I missed the bus.

189
00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:23.000
Oh. no. no. no. no. Mom.
Why didn't you wake me?

190
00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:25.833
Ow!

191
00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:34.500
Oh. Ugh!

192
00:12:40.666 --> 00:12:43.416
Good luck
for your presentation. sweetie.

193
00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:48.500
Whoa!!

194
00:12:51.291 --> 00:12:53.416
Don't forget
your lunch. Norman.

195
00:12:58.333 --> 00:12:59.541
Thanks. Mom!

196
00:13:00.916 --> 00:13:02.208
- Hey. wait!
- Check this out.

197
00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:04.208
-Hey. Norman!
-Oh my gosh!

198
00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.416
Loser.

199
00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:09.541
Come on. slow down.

200
00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:12.166
Oh. man.

201
00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:13.916
Huh?

202
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:19.541
Huh!

203
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.416
Try keep up!

204
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.333
Ugh!
Almost there.

205
00:13:36.333 --> 00:13:37.541
Whah!

206
00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:41.541
Hey guys. look at Norman! Look
at what he's wearing!

207
00:13:49.666 --> 00:13:51.833
Norman. are you okay?

208
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.750
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just very
late for school.

209
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:59.125
You up for a trade. Sandy?
It's cucumber and jelly.

210
00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.083
Hmm. All right.

211
00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:05.541
As long as you have it
back to me by tomorrow.

212
00:14:05.666 --> 00:14:07.000
Sure.
No problem.

213
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.791
Goodbye.

214
00:14:12.708 --> 00:14:15.791
Bye! Whoo hoo!

215
00:14:54.791 --> 00:14:56.333
We are here at Hubble High.

216
00:14:56.375 --> 00:14:58.208
where all of the students
are so beautiful.

217
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.208
-Oh no. Alejandro no.
-so exciting-

218
00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.041
Alejandro!

219
00:15:01.208 --> 00:15:04.041
And me. Alejandro.
the star of the show!

220
00:15:04.083 --> 00:15:05.708
The host with the most.

221
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.750
There's Mr. Hernandez
with his dodge balls.

222
00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:13.375
And Charlene! So vivacious.
so beautiful. so confident.

223
00:15:13.416 --> 00:15:14.416
Hey. Alejandro.

224
00:15:14.458 --> 00:15:18.375
And Frankie.
so elusive and mysterious.

225
00:15:18.458 --> 00:15:19.541
Has anyone seen Norman?

226
00:15:19.583 --> 00:15:20.791
He probably missed
the bus again.

227
00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:21.250
Again?

228
00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:23.708
Yes. you can really feel
the suspense.

229
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.458
Where is Norman.
and where is our school project?

230
00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:27.125
Oh.

231
00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:31.291
Suddenly. an evil monster
appears out of nowhere.

232
00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:33.208
Oh. Hey. Mike.

233
00:15:33.583 --> 00:15:35.375
Ugh. How are you doing?

234
00:15:35.791 --> 00:15:38.750
Evil monster?
You think you're funny. huh?

235
00:15:38.875 --> 00:15:40.541
Now that you've
come to mention it.

236
00:15:40.583 --> 00:15:43.416
I've always felt that comedy
is one of my many. many talents.

237
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.458
Oh. yeah? Well. meet one
of my many talents.

238
00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:48.791
Wait. watch out!

239
00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.416
Ugh! Agh.

240
00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.625
I'll deal with you later.

241
00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:56.833
Well. look who finally arrived.
The resident geek.

242
00:15:56.916 --> 00:15:58.000
Oh hey. Mike.

243
00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:00.208
Hey. hey. hey.
easy there. tiger.

244
00:16:00.416 --> 00:16:03.083
Everybody just take
a deep breath.

245
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.125
This isn't over.

246
00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:09.500
The fragile prey
saved by the bell.

247
00:16:09.791 --> 00:16:10.416
Ugh.

248
00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:12.208
What's up with him?

249
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.833
He's always so aggro...
macho-monkey-man.

250
00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:16.291
Thought you were going
to hack the school system

251
00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:18.291
and get mad-Mike transferred.

252
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.750
I'm working on it.

253
00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:24.291
There goes the fire alarm!

254
00:16:24.333 --> 00:16:25.916
Gus. look over there!

255
00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.583
Yeah. that might work!

256
00:16:29.291 --> 00:16:33.166
Whoa! I never thought it would
end this way!

257
00:16:50.916 --> 00:16:52.166
Gus. what's our status?

258
00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:54.500
Huh. good news is
the fire is out.

259
00:16:55.208 --> 00:16:55.750
Alright.

260
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:57.208
The bad news is we’re being
sucked in

261
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.833
by that giant vacuum hose!

262
00:16:59.916 --> 00:17:03.416
Ah. I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

263
00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:07.500
Whaaaaah!

264
00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:10.666
Norman?

265
00:17:10.708 --> 00:17:12.625
Norman. are you okay?

266
00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:14.333
-Quick. stand back.
-Can you breathe?

267
00:17:14.375 --> 00:17:16.833
- He's dying.
- He's not dying.

268
00:17:18.875 --> 00:17:20.000
Thanks. Frankie.

269
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.000
Alejandro. do you have to
film everything?

270
00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:25.333
I am just giving people
what they want.

271
00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:28.416
Okay. let's go to class. guys.

272
00:17:28.583 --> 00:17:29.458
Are you coming?

273
00:17:29.708 --> 00:17:31.000
I'm okay.

274
00:17:31.416 --> 00:17:33.500
Our hero lives
to fight another day.

275
00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:34.875
What did you put in this stuff?

276
00:17:38.083 --> 00:17:39.125
Where did they go?

277
00:17:39.208 --> 00:17:40.625
I’m not picking
anything up

278
00:17:40.666 --> 00:17:42.041
on the scanners. Sir.

279
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:46.333
Well. they can't be far.
They were on fire!

280
00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:49.500
Sir. we have to find refuge
somewhere.

281
00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:52.583
Engine number two is failing
and we are losing fuel.

282
00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:55.708
Hagh! Those infernal peace
keepers!

283
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.416
Get the invasion fleet
to send help immediately!

284
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:02.416
Sir. we've lost contact
with the fleet.

285
00:18:02.458 --> 00:18:03.666
What?

286
00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:07.041
Well. then we’ll just have
to find

287
00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:09.458
another way to make contact.

288
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.375
Sir. I suggest we take control
of one of these creatures

289
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.500
and use it to build a
communications device.

290
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:19.291
Look at you! Mindless metal
scraping together an idea.

291
00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:20.875
School's started!

292
00:18:20.916 --> 00:18:22.666
The bell has rung already.

293
00:18:22.916 --> 00:18:26.125
Come now. come now. Hurry up.
We don't have all day!

294
00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:27.500
Scott!

295
00:18:28.083 --> 00:18:31.416
How many times have I told you
to leave that at home?

296
00:18:31.583 --> 00:18:33.000
I'll take that.

297
00:18:33.291 --> 00:18:35.291
You can have it back
when you graduate.

298
00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:38.291
which will probably be never.

299
00:18:38.416 --> 00:18:40.416
Frankie Helman! Get that hair
out of your face!

300
00:18:40.583 --> 00:18:41.625
Hi. Ms. Witherington.

301
00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:43.458
Hi. Charlene.

302
00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:47.333
You! If I told you once-

303
00:18:47.375 --> 00:18:52.000
There! We have found the leader
of this primitive planet.

304
00:18:52.041 --> 00:18:54.625
Plotting shortest route to the
creature’s control centre.

305
00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:57.250
As if you know what to do.

306
00:18:57.375 --> 00:19:01.750
Just get me down there
so that I can take control.

307
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.166
There we go.
on the double.

308
00:19:04.916 --> 00:19:06.125
Yah! Ah. ooh.

309
00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:11.791
Sir. we are ready.

310
00:19:12.458 --> 00:19:16.125
Aah! This is the best part.

311
00:19:16.541 --> 00:19:21.708
Mwhoo hoo hoo... Aaaah!

312
00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:50.333
...you know I was just...

313
00:19:50.458 --> 00:19:51.458
You just what?

314
00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:52.791
I don't know.

315
00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:53.833
Are you okay?

316
00:19:53.875 --> 00:19:56.833
Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.
I'm fine.

317
00:20:00.875 --> 00:20:02.916
Looks organic to me.

318
00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:06.000
Yeah. kind of creepy.

319
00:20:06.125 --> 00:20:09.750
Okay. we're inside
a human being.

320
00:20:10.333 --> 00:20:14.416
It's sentient. capable of
abstract thought. language.

321
00:20:14.458 --> 00:20:17.541
Yeah. not bad.
Kind of primitive. but it'll do.

322
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.708
There's an organic
power core right up ahead.

323
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.166
Let's head there.
We can plug in. repair ship.

324
00:20:24.208 --> 00:20:26.958
and try find out
what happened to Zolthard.

325
00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:39.708
Norman?

326
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.208
Are you okay?

327
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.708
You're acting all weird.

328
00:20:43.458 --> 00:20:45.375
I feel kind of weird.

329
00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:50.125
It's as if my brain is itchy
or something.

330
00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:55.750
Wow. That's awesome.

331
00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:03.375
There it is.
The power core.

332
00:21:03.416 --> 00:21:05.166
Huh.

333
00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:14.875
Good morning. everybody.

334
00:21:14.916 --> 00:21:17.291
Settle down.
Settle down. please.

335
00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:20.916
I hope you kids are ready
for your presentations.

336
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.000
Oh. I'm getting
too old for this.

337
00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:30.708
Why can't Gus do this part?

338
00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:33.750
Remember the last time you
programmed the ship's computer?

339
00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:35.708
Oh. yeah.

340
00:21:36.583 --> 00:21:38.291
Right. you ready?

341
00:21:38.875 --> 00:21:40.875
You're probably
going to need this. Max.

342
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.375
Of course.

343
00:21:46.916 --> 00:21:49.333
SPF. open door.

344
00:21:49.625 --> 00:21:51.375
Really. Max?

345
00:22:10.833 --> 00:22:13.000
Okay. I can see you.
Can you hear me?

346
00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.083
Roger that.

347
00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.791
Yeah. loud and clear.

348
00:22:16.291 --> 00:22:17.958
Let's find out where we are.

349
00:22:18.916 --> 00:22:19.750
There it is.

350
00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:21.083
Okay. according to my scanners.

351
00:22:21.125 --> 00:22:23.208
it should be
right in front of you.

352
00:22:24.708 --> 00:22:27.041
Okay. Here goes.

353
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.041
How about over here?

354
00:22:35.458 --> 00:22:36.333
Huh!

355
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.791
Yes. Norman?

356
00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:39.250
Huh. uh.

357
00:22:39.708 --> 00:22:40.916
Norman?

358
00:22:41.291 --> 00:22:43.250
I... I...

359
00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:45.791
Well. since you're up.
your group may go first.

360
00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:47.416
Argh.

361
00:22:48.416 --> 00:22:49.416
I'm sorry. guys.

362
00:22:49.458 --> 00:22:52.083
Yeah. we're going
to be here 'til lunch.

363
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:54.125
They're definitely
talking about aliens.

364
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.833
Always.

365
00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:02.333
Oh. yeah.

366
00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:06.125
"WHY WE THINK THERE'S LIFE
ON OTHER PLANETS".

367
00:23:06.166 --> 00:23:08.791
Oh. here we go again.

368
00:23:08.916 --> 00:23:12.500
There are billions of galaxies
in the universe.

369
00:23:12.541 --> 00:23:15.250
Yeah. well I wish
you'd go to one of them.

370
00:23:21.708 --> 00:23:25.166
And each of these galaxies
contains billions of stars.

371
00:23:26.166 --> 00:23:28.541
Over here.

372
00:23:28.666 --> 00:23:30.250
Okay. let's see.

373
00:23:30.291 --> 00:23:33.583
Each of those stars
may have a planet similar...

374
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.125
Uh...

375
00:23:35.416 --> 00:23:38.208
Similar. to our own planet

376
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:43.708
capable of sustaining
intelligent. uhm

377
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.875
life.

378
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.541
-Hmm.
-Huh.

379
00:23:47.791 --> 00:23:48.625
That is so weird.

380
00:23:48.666 --> 00:23:51.000
Now. now people who
believe in aliens are

381
00:23:51.041 --> 00:23:53.500
often thought of as
weird or eccentric.

382
00:23:53.791 --> 00:23:55.166
Let's see what this baby can do.

383
00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.833
We are here to show you today

384
00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:03.416
that we are just the same
as all of you.

385
00:24:03.458 --> 00:24:04.416
What is he doing?

386
00:24:04.458 --> 00:24:05.333
I don't know.

387
00:24:06.083 --> 00:24:06.666
Norman.

388
00:24:07.583 --> 00:24:08.375
-Norman!
-Whoa!

389
00:24:08.416 --> 00:24:09.458
I'm sorry.

390
00:24:11.125 --> 00:24:12.166
What are you doing?

391
00:24:12.208 --> 00:24:13.125
Nothing.

392
00:24:15.125 --> 00:24:16.875
- I will talk you
-Testing. testing.

393
00:24:17.083 --> 00:24:17.750
-through the amazing...
-Do you hear me?

394
00:24:17.791 --> 00:24:18.500
Yes.

395
00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:20.583
-Norman. Thank you.
-Yes? Can you hear that?

396
00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:22.125
-Can I hear what. Norman?
-You can't hear that?

397
00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:24.291
No. thank you. Norman.
You're done.

398
00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:26.791
Yes. Yes. I can hear you.

399
00:24:27.333 --> 00:24:29.666
Oh. not you.
The voices.

400
00:24:29.958 --> 00:24:32.625
Charlene! Perhaps I should
talk about Area 51 or Roswell?

401
00:24:32.666 --> 00:24:36.208
Hey. Gus. I said. where do
you want me to plug this one in?

402
00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:36.875
No!

403
00:24:36.916 --> 00:24:38.625
Wait a minute.
What's going on here. Charlene.

404
00:24:39.083 --> 00:24:41.541
Plug what in? Don't let them
plug anything in!

405
00:24:41.791 --> 00:24:43.291
Oh wait. here we go.

406
00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:45.583
How's that?

407
00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:56.791
Norman. where are
you going?

408
00:25:01.375 --> 00:25:02.500
Okay Gus. try it now.

409
00:25:02.583 --> 00:25:05.416
Nearly ready.
We should have visuals...

410
00:25:06.791 --> 00:25:08.000
There.

411
00:25:08.125 --> 00:25:09.958
Oh. wow.

412
00:25:10.416 --> 00:25:11.291
Ugh?

413
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.958
Hey look Gus.
it’s your Uncle Zorg!

414
00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.208
Very funny.

415
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.708
Actually. it looks a
bit like my ex-wife.

416
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:20.958
-You remember her. right?
-How can I can forget.

417
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.583
She had tentacles coming out of
her face man! It was everywhere-

418
00:25:23.791 --> 00:25:25.458
Stop!

419
00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:31.208
Thank you.

420
00:25:31.625 --> 00:25:32.458
Don't mention it.

421
00:25:32.541 --> 00:25:34.666
Wait. who are you?

422
00:25:34.958 --> 00:25:36.541
I'm Special Officer Sophie.

423
00:25:36.625 --> 00:25:39.291
I'm even more special.
Captain Max.

424
00:25:39.416 --> 00:25:42.083
I'm Tech Specialist Gus.

425
00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:44.166
I'm Norman.

426
00:25:44.208 --> 00:25:45.791
Hi. Norman.

427
00:25:45.875 --> 00:25:48.291
It's like you're
inside my head... Huh!

428
00:25:48.708 --> 00:25:50.458
Wait! Are you inside my head?

429
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:51.500
Kid. relax.

430
00:25:51.541 --> 00:25:52.458
Relax?

431
00:25:52.708 --> 00:25:53.958
That's it. I'm going crazy.

432
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.375
They're going to lock me up
in an insane asylum--

433
00:25:55.416 --> 00:25:56.583
We don't have time for this.

434
00:25:56.666 --> 00:25:58.791
My friends are right.
I'm totally crazy right now.

435
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:00.666
Uh. owww!

436
00:26:00.708 --> 00:26:02.875
Repeat after me. Norman.

437
00:26:02.958 --> 00:26:03.750
Wait. wait. wait.
What are you doing?

438
00:26:03.791 --> 00:26:06.125
"There are tiny aliens."

439
00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:08.375
There are tiny aliens.

440
00:26:08.416 --> 00:26:09.958
"Inside my head."

441
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.875
Ah. come on. Ah!

442
00:26:12.041 --> 00:26:13.291
Inside my head!

443
00:26:14.291 --> 00:26:17.791
Uh. oh-- Hey!

444
00:26:17.833 --> 00:26:19.166
Hmm.

445
00:26:20.333 --> 00:26:22.833
Ow. okay. okay. fine. fine.
I believe you.

446
00:26:22.875 --> 00:26:24.000
Now. will you just let go?

447
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.333
Whoop!

448
00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:27.041
What are you doing?

449
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.416
Fine.

450
00:26:28.666 --> 00:26:31.791
Can you please
never do that again?

451
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.333
It's okay. kid.
We're not here to hurt you.

452
00:26:35.583 --> 00:26:37.458
The truth is.
we're kind of stuck in here.

453
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.791
and we need your help.

454
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:42.083
Well. firstly...

455
00:26:42.416 --> 00:26:45.666
I knew it!
I knew there was life out there.

456
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.875
And now. it's here.

457
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.125
Oh. man.
This is so totally cool.

458
00:26:51.708 --> 00:26:53.958
Wait. what do you mean
you need my help?

459
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.041
Look. I'm really sorry.

460
00:26:56.125 --> 00:26:57.750
We weren't planning
to crash land--

461
00:26:57.791 --> 00:27:00.291
Down my throat?
And now you're in my brain?

462
00:27:00.833 --> 00:27:02.166
This is the tragedy.

463
00:27:02.541 --> 00:27:03.708
How are you going to save Earth

464
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.166
when you're the one
stuck in my head?

465
00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:10.166
Please. Norman. We know
it's not ideal. Trust me.

466
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.083
We just need some time
to repair our ship

467
00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:13.416
and get back to our mission.

468
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.541
What mission?

469
00:27:14.625 --> 00:27:15.708
Norman?

470
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.666
Huh!

471
00:27:16.958 --> 00:27:18.666
Who are you talking to?

472
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.833
Hey. Norman. she's nice.

473
00:27:21.166 --> 00:27:22.541
Oh. yeah. she's great!

474
00:27:22.791 --> 00:27:23.541
Huh?

475
00:27:23.625 --> 00:27:25.083
No. no. no. no.
Not you. shut up.

476
00:27:25.125 --> 00:27:26.666
Norman. don't tell me
to shut up.

477
00:27:26.708 --> 00:27:28.000
No. no. no. no. no. no.
not you.

478
00:27:28.041 --> 00:27:29.250
Then who. Norman?

479
00:27:29.416 --> 00:27:32.250
Uh. the voices... in my head.

480
00:27:32.291 --> 00:27:34.333
Are you going crazy?

481
00:27:35.333 --> 00:27:37.958
Norman! What are you doing
in the girls bathroom?

482
00:27:38.375 --> 00:27:40.166
That is a good question.
I was--

483
00:27:40.208 --> 00:27:42.000
Actually. Mr. Anderson.

484
00:27:42.041 --> 00:27:43.875
what are you doing
in the girls bathroom?

485
00:27:43.916 --> 00:27:45.625
Well. I...

486
00:27:46.041 --> 00:27:48.083
Norman. explain yourself.

487
00:27:48.208 --> 00:27:50.666
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

488
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:53.166
Well. you can explain it
to Principal Witherington.

489
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:56.458
-What? No! Man!
-Come with me.

490
00:27:59.291 --> 00:28:01.250
Who's Principal Witherington?

491
00:28:04.708 --> 00:28:07.708
Mm. hmm?

492
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.541
Ugh! Yuck.

493
00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:12.458
Ooh.

494
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.166
Hmm?

495
00:28:16.416 --> 00:28:18.250
Oh!

496
00:28:19.666 --> 00:28:23.000
Huh? Oh! Ah-haa!

497
00:28:27.833 --> 00:28:28.958
Ugh!

498
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.458
Good morning.
Ms. Witherington.

499
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.458
Argh!

500
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.625
Can I help you?

501
00:28:36.666 --> 00:28:38.000
It speaks!

502
00:28:38.041 --> 00:28:40.416
Do you need me
to get hold of someone for you?

503
00:28:40.541 --> 00:28:41.958
Yes! Yes.

504
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.250
I need you to get hold
of the Mothership.

505
00:28:45.291 --> 00:28:46.791
and tell them to send--

506
00:28:46.833 --> 00:28:48.250
Ahem...

507
00:28:48.333 --> 00:28:52.458
Excuse me. Ms. Witherington.
but I need to see you.

508
00:28:52.833 --> 00:28:53.666
Who?

509
00:28:53.875 --> 00:28:57.166
-You. Yes.
-Me?

510
00:28:57.375 --> 00:28:59.625
It's about Norman here.

511
00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:03.291
Nn... Nnn. Nnnn. Nor-man.

512
00:29:03.416 --> 00:29:05.166
That's me.

513
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:07.000
Uh. Mr?

514
00:29:07.041 --> 00:29:08.625
Mr. Anderson.

515
00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:11.166
You. uh. want me
to phone your Mothership?

516
00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:13.708
-Mothership?
-Mr. Anderson. what do you want?

517
00:29:13.958 --> 00:29:17.833
As you can see.
I'm a very busy man.

518
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.208
- Man?
- Ah!

519
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.583
-Ah! Ah!
-I'm sorry.

520
00:29:21.625 --> 00:29:23.416
-Ah! Ah!
-but it's a discipline problem.

521
00:29:23.875 --> 00:29:29.041
You know. you can't run a Galaxy
without discipline

522
00:29:29.083 --> 00:29:34.000
nor control. that's the key.
Always control.

523
00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:38.125
- Galaxy?
- Hmm? What?

524
00:29:38.291 --> 00:29:39.458
You said Galaxy.

525
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.291
No. I didn't.

526
00:29:40.333 --> 00:29:41.166
Sounded like Galaxy
to me!

527
00:29:41.208 --> 00:29:44.416
No!

528
00:29:45.625 --> 00:29:47.291
What do you want?

529
00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:49.708
Perhaps we should get back
to the problem.

530
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.541
This Principal Witherington
person is acting all...

531
00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:54.416
The problem...

532
00:29:54.458 --> 00:29:55.875
-is that nobody wants to hear.
-Weird!

533
00:29:55.916 --> 00:29:56.875
Yeah.

534
00:29:56.916 --> 00:29:58.625
and if they do
not want to hear--

535
00:29:58.666 --> 00:30:02.750
Doesn't she remind you of
someone we know?

536
00:30:04.708 --> 00:30:05.791
Zolthard!

537
00:30:06.291 --> 00:30:07.791
Zolthard?

538
00:30:08.416 --> 00:30:09.041
Zolthard?

539
00:30:09.083 --> 00:30:10.333
Quiet!

540
00:30:12.583 --> 00:30:15.708
What did you just say?

541
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.833
Norman. get out of there!

542
00:30:18.166 --> 00:30:20.625
I. uh... nothing.

543
00:30:20.666 --> 00:30:23.083
I really should be going.

544
00:30:23.416 --> 00:30:24.416
Norman. what's going on?

545
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.041
One more word from you!

546
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.208
Norman. is it?

547
00:30:31.875 --> 00:30:35.000
Norman. Norman!

548
00:30:36.541 --> 00:30:38.708
Or should I say.

549
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.791
Max!

550
00:30:40.083 --> 00:30:41.708
Whargh!

551
00:30:42.125 --> 00:30:44.000
Oh. I'm really sorry.
Mr. Anderson.

552
00:30:44.041 --> 00:30:45.375
I'll explain later.
but I got to go.

553
00:30:45.416 --> 00:30:47.583
Norman. you stay right here.

554
00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:48.708
Whoa!

555
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.416
Alright. you're mine now.

556
00:30:52.458 --> 00:30:55.791
Huh!

557
00:30:56.916 --> 00:30:57.750
After that boy!

558
00:30:57.791 --> 00:30:59.333
What?

559
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.750
- ...see about that.
-Whoa!

560
00:31:01.958 --> 00:31:02.625
You again?

561
00:31:02.875 --> 00:31:05.166
Now. now. Mike.
Haven't you gotten yourself

562
00:31:05.208 --> 00:31:06.375
into enough trouble already?

563
00:31:06.458 --> 00:31:07.375
Whah!

564
00:31:07.708 --> 00:31:09.375
Yeah. you gotta run!

565
00:31:10.916 --> 00:31:12.708
Mr. Anderson?

566
00:31:12.916 --> 00:31:13.958
Are. are you okay?

567
00:31:14.375 --> 00:31:15.833
What's up with him.

568
00:31:15.916 --> 00:31:19.083
Ms. Witherington.
is everything--

569
00:31:19.125 --> 00:31:21.250
No. no. no. no.
Wait. wait!

570
00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:22.875
What are you doing?
No. no no. Wait!

571
00:31:22.958 --> 00:31:24.166
Huh?

572
00:31:32.083 --> 00:31:33.125
Ooh!

573
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.625
-Norman?
-Aah!

574
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:37.916
What is going on?

575
00:31:38.041 --> 00:31:39.875
I don't know. I can't explain.

576
00:31:39.916 --> 00:31:42.291
You don't know.
or you can't explain?

577
00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:47.000
I'm really sorry. guys.
but I got to get out of here.

578
00:31:49.166 --> 00:31:51.666
What the... Urgh!

579
00:31:52.041 --> 00:31:53.458
Where is she going?

580
00:31:54.958 --> 00:31:56.083
Ugh!

581
00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:57.583
Hey. thanks. man.

582
00:31:57.625 --> 00:31:59.375
-No problem.
-Okay. see you after class.

583
00:31:59.541 --> 00:32:00.500
-Hey. man!
-Sorry.

584
00:32:08.541 --> 00:32:09.666
Mr. Hernandez?

585
00:32:12.541 --> 00:32:16.625
Nowhere to go now?

586
00:32:17.916 --> 00:32:20.291
Norman. I'm taking control!

587
00:32:20.583 --> 00:32:22.291
What again?
No. no. no.

588
00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:23.500
You promised
you wouldn't do it--

589
00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:26.708
Huh.

590
00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.000
Oh. my gosh.

591
00:33:04.333 --> 00:33:06.708
-Did you see him?
-OMG. did you see that?

592
00:33:06.833 --> 00:33:08.041
-Norman just--
-Did you--

593
00:33:08.083 --> 00:33:09.833
No way.

594
00:33:10.041 --> 00:33:11.375
Back to you. Norman.

595
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.916
Uhh.

596
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.125
Hey. Soph. Good job.

597
00:33:17.208 --> 00:33:18.375
Piece of cake.

598
00:33:18.416 --> 00:33:20.416
Guys. hostiles at 6 o’clock.

599
00:33:20.458 --> 00:33:22.625
We drained all his power.
What are we going to do?

600
00:33:24.208 --> 00:33:25.916
Norman. get in!

601
00:33:26.958 --> 00:33:27.958
Get in!

602
00:33:29.083 --> 00:33:29.958
Aah!

603
00:33:42.708 --> 00:33:45.166
You fools.
Get after them!

604
00:33:46.375 --> 00:33:47.583
What's wrong with you?

605
00:33:51.541 --> 00:33:53.416
Uh. here.
Drink this.

606
00:33:57.291 --> 00:34:00.166
Thanks. Charlene.
you saved my life.

607
00:34:00.375 --> 00:34:02.958
Yeah. well. unless you want me
to turn this thing around.

608
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.083
you better start telling me
what's going on.

609
00:34:05.416 --> 00:34:07.125
And how did you learn
to move like that?

610
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.583
-Uh-
-Well?

611
00:34:08.625 --> 00:34:10.208
Can't you just give me
a break?

612
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.916
You seriously would not
believe me.

613
00:34:11.958 --> 00:34:12.958
even if I told you.

614
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.416
Norman. how long have we
known each other?

615
00:34:15.458 --> 00:34:17.375
I know. I know!
But still.

616
00:34:17.791 --> 00:34:20.375
I'm not even sure I believe it.

617
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.708
Okay.

618
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:27.625
so it started when Anderson
caught me in the bathroom--

619
00:34:27.666 --> 00:34:28.625
-Yeah!
-Ow!

620
00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:31.000
- Ugh. oh.
- What the--

621
00:34:31.541 --> 00:34:32.416
Oh. no.

622
00:34:32.708 --> 00:34:35.041
If you surrender now.

623
00:34:35.083 --> 00:34:37.208
Zolthard says he will go
easy on you.

624
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:38.333
Yes. easy.

625
00:34:38.416 --> 00:34:39.541
Who is Zolthard?

626
00:34:39.583 --> 00:34:40.583
Watch out!

627
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.541
Uh. he's an evil alien
who's taken control

628
00:34:43.583 --> 00:34:45.041
of Principal Witherington.

629
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:46.791
Seriously. what's going on?

630
00:34:46.833 --> 00:34:49.041
Why are the teachers
chasing after us?

631
00:34:49.291 --> 00:34:51.333
Guys. we need more info here.

632
00:34:51.375 --> 00:34:52.625
Who are you talking to?

633
00:34:52.666 --> 00:34:54.083
The aliens in my head.

634
00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:55.250
Are you kidding me?

635
00:34:55.291 --> 00:34:57.416
No. no. no. no.
I'm being serious. Charlene.

636
00:34:57.833 --> 00:34:58.375
Guys?

637
00:34:58.416 --> 00:35:00.583
Okay. let me explain.

638
00:35:00.625 --> 00:35:02.833
Zolthard is an evil mastermind

639
00:35:02.875 --> 00:35:04.500
who's trying to take over
your planet.

640
00:35:04.708 --> 00:35:05.750
Hold on a second.

641
00:35:05.791 --> 00:35:08.250
And Zolthard wants
galactic domination.

642
00:35:08.291 --> 00:35:09.208
Who am I talking to?

643
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:11.458
And he's in control
of your teachers.

644
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.041
Okay. but why is he after us?

645
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.916
We stopped him from invading
another planet. so

646
00:35:17.166 --> 00:35:19.791
Now he's out for revenge.
Look out!

647
00:35:20.708 --> 00:35:21.583
Watch out!

648
00:35:21.625 --> 00:35:23.250
Whoa. whoa!

649
00:35:24.166 --> 00:35:26.083
We've got to help them
get rid of these Droids.

650
00:35:26.125 --> 00:35:27.291
He's not up to power yet.

651
00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:29.750
Well. let's try and find
a way out.

652
00:35:30.291 --> 00:35:31.791
Gus. what about that?

653
00:35:31.875 --> 00:35:32.958
Yeah. that might do.

654
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.708
Okay. Norman.
I want you to turn left.

655
00:35:35.083 --> 00:35:36.375
- What?
- Turn left...

656
00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:37.791
NOW!

657
00:35:44.125 --> 00:35:45.708
Charlene!

658
00:35:48.958 --> 00:35:50.625
Look out. get out the way.
get out the way!

659
00:35:51.208 --> 00:35:52.416
-Look out!
-Awh!

660
00:35:54.125 --> 00:35:55.208
What is wrong with you?

661
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.708
I'm sorry. but I think
we slowed them down.

662
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:58.666
What's wrong with them?

663
00:35:58.708 --> 00:35:59.583
I don't know!

664
00:36:03.166 --> 00:36:05.708
-Uh!
-Ow!

665
00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:07.875
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

666
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:09.291
I think we lost them.

667
00:36:09.458 --> 00:36:10.583
Yeah.

668
00:36:10.666 --> 00:36:12.208
Okay. come on. get it started.

669
00:36:13.166 --> 00:36:13.833
We got to go!

670
00:36:13.875 --> 00:36:15.208
Oh. no.

671
00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.625
Yeah. now we're going to
get them.

672
00:36:16.666 --> 00:36:17.833
They're not working!

673
00:36:17.916 --> 00:36:20.166
Come on! Oh. no.
We've got to go.

674
00:36:20.208 --> 00:36:21.166
We've to get out of here!
Now!

675
00:36:21.291 --> 00:36:22.500
Go now. go now. go now!
Go!

676
00:36:22.541 --> 00:36:23.916
Haa!

677
00:36:26.291 --> 00:36:27.500
Go get them.

678
00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:28.291
Wait. are you
kidding me?

679
00:36:28.333 --> 00:36:32.375
Yeah. Yeah.

680
00:36:32.875 --> 00:36:34.500
Hey. stop that!

681
00:36:34.958 --> 00:36:36.791
Okay. kick him.

682
00:36:38.166 --> 00:36:39.125
Get away from me!

683
00:36:39.625 --> 00:36:40.666
Aaah!

684
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:50.291
-You won't get away.
-Hahaha!

685
00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:51.666
Sophie?

686
00:36:52.625 --> 00:36:53.708
A little help. please.

687
00:36:54.166 --> 00:36:55.583
Leave it to me.

688
00:36:59.291 --> 00:37:00.583
Eeewww!

689
00:37:01.541 --> 00:37:02.583
What are you doing?

690
00:37:02.666 --> 00:37:03.833
Just keep driving
straight.

691
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.750
What?

692
00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:05.791
Huuh!

693
00:37:05.833 --> 00:37:09.541
We got you now!

694
00:37:11.916 --> 00:37:12.916
Aargh.

695
00:37:13.416 --> 00:37:14.625
Ah-ha!

696
00:37:16.541 --> 00:37:19.541
See you later coach!
“Freakazoid”!

697
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:22.791
Huh? Oh!

698
00:37:22.958 --> 00:37:25.208
Oh no. this is going to hurt.

699
00:37:25.666 --> 00:37:26.750
Ugh! Ooh!

700
00:37:29.208 --> 00:37:29.708
Argh!

701
00:37:30.416 --> 00:37:32.083
You're welcome.

702
00:37:32.625 --> 00:37:35.625
Hmm. This kid's power
doesn't last very long.

703
00:37:35.916 --> 00:37:36.750
Norman?

704
00:37:37.416 --> 00:37:38.458
Norman!

705
00:37:39.333 --> 00:37:42.250
Just get me to Virgil's.
He'll know what to do.

706
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.083
Hey. guys.
Look what I found.

707
00:37:46.375 --> 00:37:47.833
Yeah. that's a Requiem 2000.

708
00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:49.708
Whoa!

709
00:37:49.791 --> 00:37:52.833
You and me are going to
get along just fine.

710
00:37:53.166 --> 00:37:54.416
It is useless. you know?

711
00:37:54.458 --> 00:37:54.958
What?

712
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.333
Yeah. Power pack's missing.

713
00:37:56.416 --> 00:37:57.125
Really?

714
00:37:57.208 --> 00:38:00.416
Yep. I wonder what
Zolthard is up to.

715
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:02.416
Well. until Norman's
back online.

716
00:38:02.458 --> 00:38:03.958
there's nothing we can do.

717
00:38:10.333 --> 00:38:11.916
Haa!

718
00:38:12.166 --> 00:38:14.500
And?

719
00:38:14.541 --> 00:38:17.166
Sorry. Boss. They got a--

720
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:23.041
- They got away.
- Again!

721
00:38:23.333 --> 00:38:24.500
It's your fault.

722
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:26.500
My fault? Is not!

723
00:38:26.791 --> 00:38:28.916
Stop that!

724
00:38:30.125 --> 00:38:32.875
We need to get the Droid army
down here yesterday!

725
00:38:33.208 --> 00:38:34.541
How are we
going to do that. Boss?

726
00:38:34.583 --> 00:38:37.458
We need to send them a signal!

727
00:38:37.916 --> 00:38:39.833
Those pesky peace keepers

728
00:38:39.875 --> 00:38:42.666
are stuck inside that
Norman creature.

729
00:38:42.916 --> 00:38:45.000
They have the coordinates
of that wormhole.

730
00:38:45.125 --> 00:38:45.875
Wormhole?

731
00:38:46.208 --> 00:38:49.666
We need to get rid of these.
what do you call them again?

732
00:38:49.875 --> 00:38:51.500
-Kids.
-Kids! Good.

733
00:38:53.375 --> 00:38:55.458
Hello. kids.

734
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.250
This is your leader speaking.

735
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:03.125
School's out early!
It's home time.

736
00:39:03.375 --> 00:39:06.208
Something weird is going on.

737
00:39:06.333 --> 00:39:09.000
You're right. Frankie.
It's time for a live-stream.

738
00:39:09.375 --> 00:39:11.291
This is your host. Alejandro.

739
00:39:11.666 --> 00:39:13.208
As you can see.

740
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:16.125
trapped in the middle
of this unscheduled evacuation.

741
00:39:16.583 --> 00:39:19.166
We are surrounded.
and we don't know where to go.

742
00:39:19.208 --> 00:39:21.000
And who knows
how long we have?

743
00:39:21.166 --> 00:39:22.791
Are you serious right now?

744
00:39:23.458 --> 00:39:26.166
What we need to do
is find Charlene and Norman.

745
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:27.666
Look at the chaos!

746
00:39:27.916 --> 00:39:28.875
I am risking my life

747
00:39:28.916 --> 00:39:31.250
to bring you these updates.
minute by minute.

748
00:39:34.708 --> 00:39:37.458
It looks like the
main stampede is over.

749
00:39:37.958 --> 00:39:40.500
but the strangest thing of all.

750
00:39:40.541 --> 00:39:42.250
it appears like the
teachers themselves

751
00:39:42.291 --> 00:39:44.875
are breaking down the school.

752
00:39:45.333 --> 00:39:47.250
Alejandro. Out.

753
00:39:53.625 --> 00:39:54.500
Where are you guys?

754
00:39:54.541 --> 00:39:56.708
You won't believe the drama
we just witnessed.

755
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:58.250
It's crazy.
it's like the end of the world.

756
00:39:58.291 --> 00:39:59.666
Charlene? Listen.

757
00:39:59.708 --> 00:40:01.208
you're not going to believe
what's happened.

758
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:04.666
There is no way your day
was stranger than mine.

759
00:40:04.791 --> 00:40:07.250
Meet us at Virgil's
as soon as you can.

760
00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:13.000
So. what do you think?

761
00:40:13.583 --> 00:40:16.416
I believe you.
I guess.

762
00:40:17.541 --> 00:40:20.458
Okay. Virgil will know
what to do.

763
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.583
Yeah.

764
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.708
Let's see what he has to say.

765
00:40:34.333 --> 00:40:35.583
Hello?

766
00:40:40.333 --> 00:40:42.083
Hey. who's there?

767
00:40:42.125 --> 00:40:43.000
Oh. hi. Virgil--

768
00:40:43.041 --> 00:40:44.625
Norman. over here.

769
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.291
Listen. I got to talk to you.
Something big is--

770
00:40:46.333 --> 00:40:48.291
Norman. who is that with you?

771
00:40:48.333 --> 00:40:50.000
It's me. Virgil.

772
00:40:50.041 --> 00:40:50.916
Oh!

773
00:40:51.291 --> 00:40:52.666
Did anyone see you guys
come in here?

774
00:40:52.708 --> 00:40:53.208
No!

775
00:40:53.416 --> 00:40:55.166
You know.
you can't be too careful.

776
00:40:55.208 --> 00:40:56.833
They're everywhere.

777
00:40:57.125 --> 00:40:59.000
Enough with the
conspiracy theories. Virgil.

778
00:40:59.583 --> 00:41:01.541
So. what brings
you guys in here?

779
00:41:01.666 --> 00:41:02.916
Mind control.

780
00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.625
Hey. did you just say mind--

781
00:41:06.666 --> 00:41:08.416
-Control. yeah.
-Yeah.

782
00:41:08.458 --> 00:41:11.583
Oh. All right. follow me.

783
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:12.708
Come on.

784
00:41:13.958 --> 00:41:17.083
All right. This guy looks like
he might actually

785
00:41:17.125 --> 00:41:18.416
know what's going on here.

786
00:41:18.458 --> 00:41:21.291
So. spill it man.

787
00:41:21.583 --> 00:41:25.000
Right. so the school.
well Principal Witherington--

788
00:41:25.041 --> 00:41:27.166
Wait. is that old battle axe
still there?

789
00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:27.791
Yeah.

790
00:41:27.875 --> 00:41:30.000
Man. she taught me English
in the third grade.

791
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:33.750
She must be like. what.
a million years old?

792
00:41:33.916 --> 00:41:36.583
Maybe she's a lizard from Mars.

793
00:41:36.625 --> 00:41:38.625
There's truth to those stories.
you know.

794
00:41:38.708 --> 00:41:41.541
Well. funny you should say that.
because an intergalactic villain

795
00:41:41.583 --> 00:41:43.916
has taking control of
Principal Witherington.

796
00:41:43.958 --> 00:41:46.333
Lizards have been-- hold up.
Did you just say intergalactic?

797
00:41:46.625 --> 00:41:48.125
He's not kidding.

798
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.666
Aliens?

799
00:41:51.083 --> 00:41:51.666
Yeah.

800
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.000
Intergalactic?

801
00:41:53.166 --> 00:41:53.916
Ah-ha.

802
00:41:54.541 --> 00:41:55.833
Control?

803
00:41:56.958 --> 00:41:57.625
Yeah.

804
00:41:57.666 --> 00:42:01.125
Mind blown. It's true!

805
00:42:01.291 --> 00:42:02.416
At last!

806
00:42:02.458 --> 00:42:04.583
I was starting to think Norman
was all we had.

807
00:42:04.625 --> 00:42:06.208
- Yeah.
- I knew he’d believe us.

808
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:07.000
I told you we should come here.

809
00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:08.041
Shhh!

810
00:42:09.583 --> 00:42:12.583
Your phones.
Quick. in the box. now!

811
00:42:12.625 --> 00:42:13.541
No way. Jose...

812
00:42:13.583 --> 00:42:14.708
Come on Charlene. just do it.

813
00:42:14.791 --> 00:42:15.583
Come on!

814
00:42:15.625 --> 00:42:16.416
Okay.

815
00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:20.083
Here. put these on.

816
00:42:21.416 --> 00:42:21.833
Really?

817
00:42:22.125 --> 00:42:23.833
Trust me.
he knows what he's doing.

818
00:42:24.958 --> 00:42:27.083
So now that that's
out of the way.

819
00:42:27.166 --> 00:42:29.958
have any of you heard of
Quantum Physics?

820
00:42:30.125 --> 00:42:31.416
Oh. Quantum Physics?
Sure.

821
00:42:31.833 --> 00:42:34.125
-Yeah.
-Yeah. quantum.

822
00:42:37.125 --> 00:42:38.458
So according to
Quantum Physics--

823
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.708
It's possible for
subatomic particles

824
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:43.166
to travel faster than
the speed of light. Old news.

825
00:42:43.208 --> 00:42:44.333
Exactly!

826
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.791
Yeah. Huh?

827
00:42:45.833 --> 00:42:46.541
Yeah!

828
00:42:46.833 --> 00:42:50.291
Also. it’s verified in
Fire Bane. Edition 2.

829
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.541
where the bad guys
shrink themselves down

830
00:42:52.583 --> 00:42:55.166
right at the end to rip off
Fort Knox.

831
00:42:55.666 --> 00:42:56.583
So it is possible.

832
00:42:56.625 --> 00:42:58.375
This guy is a nut job.

833
00:42:58.416 --> 00:43:00.291
This is one of my favourites.

834
00:43:00.791 --> 00:43:01.500
Okay.

835
00:43:01.541 --> 00:43:03.250
Maybe. possibly that the
government's involved.

836
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.541
Wait. quick. hide!
FBI!

837
00:43:07.708 --> 00:43:10.958
Oh! I hate the smell
of this place.

838
00:43:11.791 --> 00:43:15.375
Maybe Virgil forgot to shower.
Again.

839
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.541
It's just Frankie and Alejandro!
Relax.

840
00:43:17.791 --> 00:43:20.208
Hey. nice hats everybody!

841
00:43:21.333 --> 00:43:22.458
Why you don't answer my texts?

842
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.458
I'll take that.

843
00:43:23.541 --> 00:43:26.916
Oh no. Virgil. you are not
getting my phone. Virgil!

844
00:43:26.958 --> 00:43:29.041
Uh. come on guys.
you know the drill.

845
00:43:29.458 --> 00:43:31.541
Principle Witherington
went kind of loco.

846
00:43:31.583 --> 00:43:33.208
She made this
crazy announcement.

847
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:34.916
Sent everybody home.
even the teachers.

848
00:43:34.958 --> 00:43:36.083
- Mm?
- What?

849
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:40.208
Yep! There's definitely
something weird going on.

850
00:43:40.458 --> 00:43:41.625
Show them.

851
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:44.625
This must be my best work yet.

852
00:43:44.708 --> 00:43:47.125
I was considering the stage.
but the journalist in me--

853
00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:49.250
-Alejandro! Focus.
-Okay. okay.

854
00:43:49.291 --> 00:43:50.000
Look at that.

855
00:43:50.083 --> 00:43:51.458
I thought it was
the end of the world.

856
00:43:51.541 --> 00:43:53.000
It's pandemonium.

857
00:43:53.041 --> 00:43:56.750
Anderson and Hernandez seem
to be gathering scrap metal. and

858
00:43:56.791 --> 00:43:59.041
behaving like psycho zombies.

859
00:43:59.375 --> 00:44:00.916
Okay.

860
00:44:01.083 --> 00:44:03.208
I wonder if they lost
contact with their fleet.

861
00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:05.000
when we came
through that wormhole?

862
00:44:05.291 --> 00:44:07.416
Wait. you guys came
through a wormhole?

863
00:44:07.791 --> 00:44:10.041
Agh. that's so awesome!

864
00:44:10.166 --> 00:44:13.333
Norman. is there anything
you want to tell us?

865
00:44:13.541 --> 00:44:14.833
Oh yeah!

866
00:44:14.958 --> 00:44:17.791
You guys are going to be
blown away.

867
00:44:18.333 --> 00:44:20.375
I think you better tell
everyone what's going on.

868
00:44:20.625 --> 00:44:22.750
I told you there was
something going on.

869
00:44:23.041 --> 00:44:24.125
The whole story?

870
00:44:24.208 --> 00:44:25.958
Everything. And don't
forget the part

871
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.250
about the Aliens in your brain.

872
00:44:27.375 --> 00:44:29.041
It's all in here. man!

873
00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:31.166
Virgil. not helping.

874
00:44:31.375 --> 00:44:32.083
Norman?

875
00:44:32.458 --> 00:44:34.958
Okay. so if I know Zolthard.

876
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.500
he's going to try to
figure out a way

877
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:37.708
to make contact
with the fleet.

878
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.875
We need to figure out a way
to stop him.

879
00:44:40.541 --> 00:44:43.666
Well. that's not going
to happen here. is it?

880
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.791
Norman. we need you to go--

881
00:44:46.833 --> 00:44:49.625
Back to the school and find
out what Zolthard is up to.

882
00:44:50.125 --> 00:44:52.791
They think he'll bring his
fleet here. and invade Earth.

883
00:44:52.875 --> 00:44:54.375
Let me get this straight.

884
00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:56.458
You want us to go
back to the school.

885
00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.333
where the psycho zombies are.

886
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.541
where we'll be picked off
one by one.

887
00:45:00.583 --> 00:45:02.416
and there will be
a big final battle.

888
00:45:02.458 --> 00:45:05.625
and only one of us will survive.
Probably you.

889
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:06.750
Yeah.

890
00:45:06.916 --> 00:45:09.041
Uh. guys look.

891
00:45:09.125 --> 00:45:10.750
I know I've been like the
worst friend ever

892
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:12.875
and I got you guys in
tons of trouble.

893
00:45:12.958 --> 00:45:14.500
And like. you've always
been there for me

894
00:45:14.541 --> 00:45:16.375
in any of my crazy ideas.

895
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.916
But this is my mission.

896
00:45:20.208 --> 00:45:21.750
You guys should stay here.

897
00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:25.250
And besides. I'm the one
with the aliens in my head.

898
00:45:25.291 --> 00:45:27.750
I'm the one who needs to
join forces with them.

899
00:45:27.791 --> 00:45:30.875
and take on Zolthard.
and save the entire planet.

900
00:45:30.916 --> 00:45:33.791
Sure. I may need help.
but I'll find it out there.

901
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.875
Wherever the fight for
freedom and justice is.

902
00:45:35.916 --> 00:45:37.083
that's where I'll be.

903
00:45:37.166 --> 00:45:38.458
Should we put him
out of his misery?

904
00:45:38.583 --> 00:45:39.458
A bit pathetic.

905
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.250
-Charlene?
-Let's do it.

906
00:45:40.291 --> 00:45:41.333
Zolthard thinks he can hide.

907
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.708
He can't hide from us.

908
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:44.625
-We're the main-- huh?
-Norman!

909
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:46.291
You're taking this a
little too seriously.

910
00:45:46.333 --> 00:45:47.125
But I--

911
00:45:47.166 --> 00:45:49.875
Oh. don't be a lunatic. Norman.
We're all coming with you.

912
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:51.625
Yeah. who knows.
might be interesting.

913
00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:53.333
Yeah! Crazy teachers.

914
00:45:53.375 --> 00:45:55.541
Psycho zombies.
Take over the entire planet.

915
00:45:55.666 --> 00:45:57.333
Somebody's got to put this
on camera.

916
00:45:57.375 --> 00:45:58.791
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

917
00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:02.708
Uhhh.

918
00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:06.291
I'm going to need
those hats back.

919
00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:23.041
Come on! This way.

920
00:46:27.875 --> 00:46:29.416
Boss is going
to like this door.

921
00:46:29.541 --> 00:46:31.958
He's going to love it. Yeah.

922
00:46:33.458 --> 00:46:35.500
There. there we go.

923
00:46:39.416 --> 00:46:42.791
Whoa. what on earth are they
doing to the school?

924
00:46:42.875 --> 00:46:43.541
What's going on?

925
00:46:43.583 --> 00:46:46.000
This is destruction
on a whole new level.

926
00:46:46.208 --> 00:46:47.708
#NoSchoolTomorrow

927
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:49.791
They're obviously
building something.

928
00:46:49.833 --> 00:46:52.000
They are turning the school
into a chop shop.

929
00:46:52.041 --> 00:46:55.583
Last time I checked. Zolthard
wasn't into trash collection.

930
00:46:55.625 --> 00:46:59.291
Yeah. I gave him a whole bunch
and he didn't like it one bit.

931
00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:01.458
This is going to be interesting.

932
00:47:01.833 --> 00:47:02.833
We have to get inside.

933
00:47:03.125 --> 00:47:04.458
Let's go.

934
00:47:05.791 --> 00:47:08.708
No. wait.

935
00:47:10.916 --> 00:47:12.833
Hurry up!

936
00:47:16.791 --> 00:47:18.833
Yoh. he's going
to love it.

937
00:47:25.125 --> 00:47:27.500
Stay frosty. kids.

938
00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:33.208
Where do we go?

939
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.750
I think it's this way.

940
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:35.666
You ready?

941
00:47:35.708 --> 00:47:36.875
Wait!

942
00:47:38.083 --> 00:47:39.375
Alejandro! What are you doing?

943
00:47:39.416 --> 00:47:41.000
- Come on. this way.
- But--

944
00:47:41.083 --> 00:47:42.625
Let's go. let's go.

945
00:47:58.416 --> 00:48:01.000
OMG! Guys!

946
00:48:01.041 --> 00:48:02.333
-What is it?
-Wait. wait!

947
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:05.666
That picture that I just took
of us? Got another 20 likes.

948
00:48:05.708 --> 00:48:07.625
- Ugh. really?
- Come on.

949
00:48:20.916 --> 00:48:22.750
Anyone else hear that.

950
00:48:25.083 --> 00:48:31.750
Let’s keep going. guys.
come on. Come on!

951
00:48:35.166 --> 00:48:39.250
- Anything?
- No. Nothing.

952
00:48:39.875 --> 00:48:41.166
Where'd they go?

953
00:48:41.375 --> 00:48:42.250
I don't know.

954
00:48:42.375 --> 00:48:43.875
This is not good.

955
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:46.458
Did you guys hear that?

956
00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.708
Norman! I am picking up
heat signatures

957
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:49.791
from behind those doors.

958
00:48:50.208 --> 00:48:52.000
Guys. it's probably
nothing.

959
00:48:52.041 --> 00:48:53.250
-Be careful!
-Alejandro. wait.

960
00:48:53.291 --> 00:48:55.333
Anderson and Hernandez
are probably--

961
00:48:58.875 --> 00:48:59.916
Right behind this door.

962
00:48:59.958 --> 00:49:01.416
RUN!!

963
00:49:04.583 --> 00:49:05.375
They're going the
wrong way.

964
00:49:05.416 --> 00:49:06.625
Come on!

965
00:49:07.708 --> 00:49:09.125
Come on.

966
00:49:09.375 --> 00:49:11.208
Quick in here.

967
00:49:18.875 --> 00:49:20.166
I think he’s gone.

968
00:49:20.208 --> 00:49:22.083
I wonder how Norman and Frankie
are doing.

969
00:49:22.166 --> 00:49:24.500
Charlene. you can just look
for yourself.

970
00:49:24.625 --> 00:49:25.625
Cool.

971
00:49:25.708 --> 00:49:28.708
So many cameras. so little time.

972
00:49:29.083 --> 00:49:31.208
Look Camera 3-
Norman and Frankie.

973
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.458
They’re heading past
the Science class.

974
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.291
Great. From here we can see if
there are any--

975
00:49:35.333 --> 00:49:36.958
Teachers. Hernandez!
On Camera 5.

976
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:37.666
he is headed
straight towards them.

977
00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:39.333
No. no. no. no!

978
00:49:39.916 --> 00:49:43.375
He should be coming out of
Camera 2 in. three. two. one.

979
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:44.750
Go Two!

980
00:49:46.666 --> 00:49:48.166
Hey. where are you guys?

981
00:49:48.291 --> 00:49:50.833
Hernandez. coming round the
corner in front of you. Hide!

982
00:49:50.875 --> 00:49:52.791
Hide. hide. hide hide.

983
00:49:59.041 --> 00:50:01.375
Be quiet.
he is right there.

984
00:50:05.041 --> 00:50:07.291
There you are.
What are you up to?

985
00:50:07.416 --> 00:50:08.291
Kids.

986
00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:10.583
Get back to work.

987
00:50:10.916 --> 00:50:12.166
Hmm.

988
00:50:13.666 --> 00:50:16.416
Don’t move.
Witherington’s still there.

989
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:19.583
Okay. she is going!

990
00:50:23.916 --> 00:50:25.750
Thanks. Are you guys ok?

991
00:50:26.041 --> 00:50:26.916
We're fine.

992
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:28.708
Wait. how do you know
where we are?

993
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:30.083
We’re in
the security room.

994
00:50:30.125 --> 00:50:32.041
We’re watching you on
the CCTV cameras.

995
00:50:32.166 --> 00:50:33.625
Oh. hey. guys.

996
00:50:33.666 --> 00:50:34.791
Hey. Norman.

997
00:50:35.041 --> 00:50:36.958
Remember. these are
high angle cameras.

998
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.250
so play to your right profile.

999
00:50:38.375 --> 00:50:39.458
It's much stronger.

1000
00:50:39.583 --> 00:50:42.458
Guys. stop fooling around.
Ok. the way is clear.

1001
00:50:43.125 --> 00:50:44.125
Anderson!

1002
00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:45.500
Run. run. run.

1003
00:50:46.291 --> 00:50:48.958
Norman! In here! Come on!

1004
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:50.625
Ok. coming.

1005
00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:06.583
Haah!

1006
00:51:06.833 --> 00:51:10.458
Guys. he's in the classroom.

1007
00:51:33.375 --> 00:51:35.625
He's coming your way.
Norman.

1008
00:51:35.666 --> 00:51:36.625
Norman. move!

1009
00:51:36.666 --> 00:51:38.916
Norman.
get out there. Go!

1010
00:51:39.708 --> 00:51:42.000
You've gotta move now.

1011
00:52:00.041 --> 00:52:02.416
Report to me.
immediately.

1012
00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:04.750
We've got work to do.

1013
00:52:08.583 --> 00:52:09.833
Let’s follow them.

1014
00:52:10.041 --> 00:52:12.875
What? Frankie! Oh. man!

1015
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.500
This is crazy. They don’t know
what they are heading in to.

1016
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:17.291
Well. let's try to help them.

1017
00:52:17.416 --> 00:52:20.125
Ok. if they are going away
from the Science classroom.

1018
00:52:20.166 --> 00:52:23.375
then that means they are
probably going towards the...

1019
00:52:24.125 --> 00:52:27.625
Charlene... you’re going to want
to see this.

1020
00:52:44.125 --> 00:52:48.166
Hey. Norman. you are not going
to believe this.

1021
00:52:48.208 --> 00:52:53.250
but inside of the gym there
is a giant doomsday device.

1022
00:52:53.916 --> 00:52:55.875
Where were you?

1023
00:52:56.375 --> 00:52:59.375
Kids.

1024
00:53:02.208 --> 00:53:04.750
Zolthard is gonna destroy the
entire planet.

1025
00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:06.791
Looks like some
kind of transmitter.

1026
00:53:06.916 --> 00:53:09.208
Oh. or maybe that.

1027
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:12.125
That's one humongous
pile of junk.

1028
00:53:12.375 --> 00:53:13.791
Gus. let's take a closer look.

1029
00:53:13.833 --> 00:53:16.833
Norman. listen to me
very carefully.

1030
00:53:16.958 --> 00:53:19.083
Zolthard is going to
use that transmitter

1031
00:53:19.125 --> 00:53:20.708
to contact his fleet.

1032
00:53:20.833 --> 00:53:23.625
If the signal gets through.
billions of Control Droids

1033
00:53:23.666 --> 00:53:26.625
will invade Earth and take over
every human being on the planet.

1034
00:53:26.666 --> 00:53:29.416
And then. Frankie.
it's all over.

1035
00:53:29.833 --> 00:53:31.916
And the last thing--
What was that?

1036
00:53:32.708 --> 00:53:34.000
Hmm?

1037
00:53:34.958 --> 00:53:36.208
How do we stop them?

1038
00:53:36.291 --> 00:53:39.375
Can't you hack into their system
and upload a virus?

1039
00:53:39.458 --> 00:53:42.208
Hmm. okay. I can give it a shot.

1040
00:53:43.125 --> 00:53:45.583
Now. as punishment.
you can move that table

1041
00:53:45.625 --> 00:53:47.583
from there to there and move
that from there to there.

1042
00:53:47.625 --> 00:53:49.208
Now move it!

1043
00:53:50.333 --> 00:53:53.166
Norman. your friend could be
onto something.

1044
00:53:53.875 --> 00:53:56.083
I need to use the
Digital Interface.

1045
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.833
Norman. you didn't seriously
just grab that for me?

1046
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.041
Oh. sorry. Frankie.
It's not me. It's Gus.

1047
00:54:06.083 --> 00:54:07.250
He says he thinks
he has a way to

1048
00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:08.666
hack into Zolthard’s systems.
and--

1049
00:54:08.708 --> 00:54:11.875
upload a virus and disable
Zolthard’s entire fleet.

1050
00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:14.083
That's pretty cool.

1051
00:54:14.291 --> 00:54:16.416
But if we do this...

1052
00:54:16.541 --> 00:54:19.666
Oh. then we could upload it
with the signal as a virus.

1053
00:54:19.833 --> 00:54:21.125
Yeah. but--

1054
00:54:21.166 --> 00:54:24.458
Yeah. that's right.
Good job.

1055
00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.875
Gus says good job.

1056
00:54:25.958 --> 00:54:28.125
Yeah. but we still have to
compile it.

1057
00:54:28.166 --> 00:54:30.291
plug it into the system
and debug it.

1058
00:54:31.416 --> 00:54:32.750
Charlene!
Gus and Frankie have

1059
00:54:32.791 --> 00:54:34.416
created a virus
to stop Zolthard.

1060
00:54:34.458 --> 00:54:35.833
- Norman!
- All we have to do

1061
00:54:35.875 --> 00:54:37.791
is upload it via the
communications device--

1062
00:54:37.833 --> 00:54:39.666
Norman!!!
You have company!

1063
00:54:39.791 --> 00:54:41.083
Wow.

1064
00:54:41.166 --> 00:54:42.541
Move! Now!

1065
00:54:42.583 --> 00:54:44.500
Norman.
this is pretty good.

1066
00:54:44.541 --> 00:54:47.041
I mean. this coding is...

1067
00:54:47.666 --> 00:54:49.666
Fun-tastic.

1068
00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:51.250
Get out of here. Frankie!

1069
00:54:51.291 --> 00:54:53.375
Don't worry about
a thing. Norman. We've got--

1070
00:54:53.416 --> 00:54:56.041
Alright. It’s time for the
grown-ups to do their thing.

1071
00:54:56.458 --> 00:54:58.000
- Max. maybe just--
- There is not enough--

1072
00:54:58.041 --> 00:54:59.666
Hey. hey. kids!

1073
00:55:00.125 --> 00:55:00.583
Guys?

1074
00:55:00.625 --> 00:55:02.291
He doesn't have the power.

1075
00:55:02.625 --> 00:55:04.583
I know how to handle myself.

1076
00:55:08.125 --> 00:55:09.958
Time to take it to the Max.

1077
00:55:10.416 --> 00:55:14.000
So. you think I’m just
some weak kid. do ya?

1078
00:55:15.416 --> 00:55:17.250
You’re facing one
of the oldest

1079
00:55:17.375 --> 00:55:20.208
and most feared
veteran law enforcers

1080
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:23.250
in the galaxy.

1081
00:55:24.166 --> 00:55:25.666
Whoa! What just happened?

1082
00:55:25.708 --> 00:55:29.166
Well. that’s a plot twist
I wasn’t expecting.

1083
00:55:29.625 --> 00:55:32.875
Yip. definitely something wrong
with these controls.

1084
00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:35.083
- What?
- Unbelievable!

1085
00:55:35.208 --> 00:55:36.333
There's something
wrong with you.

1086
00:55:36.458 --> 00:55:38.500
Now move over
and let me do this.

1087
00:55:38.625 --> 00:55:41.333
Sophie. it's no use.
Norman's gone off-line!

1088
00:55:41.583 --> 00:55:43.416
I wonder what's going on
out there.

1089
00:55:43.625 --> 00:55:46.416
And so we enter
the dark night of the soul.

1090
00:55:52.208 --> 00:55:53.458
Oh. no.

1091
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.708
Norman is coming back
online... and there.

1092
00:55:58.958 --> 00:56:00.875
Max! You came back.

1093
00:56:00.958 --> 00:56:01.958
Not good.

1094
00:56:02.458 --> 00:56:05.375
You thought that maybe
you could stop me?

1095
00:56:05.416 --> 00:56:09.333
You third rate.
peace keeping do-gooder.

1096
00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:12.041
I'll show you third rate.
Get out of my way.

1097
00:56:12.833 --> 00:56:15.750
Now listen here you two bit
excuse of a scum--

1098
00:56:15.791 --> 00:56:20.208
No! It is you my dear Max.
you should listen to me.

1099
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:24.416
Here it comes. kids.
The big bad guy speech.

1100
00:56:24.458 --> 00:56:26.375
Now all we have to do
is sit back.

1101
00:56:26.541 --> 00:56:28.458
and listen to his whole
evil plan.

1102
00:56:29.041 --> 00:56:30.166
Simple.

1103
00:56:32.166 --> 00:56:34.291
Oh. Microphone's on
isn’t it?

1104
00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:38.958
Hmm. you may have a point.

1105
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.041
It suddenly seems silly to
just lay out my plans like that.

1106
00:56:43.083 --> 00:56:44.958
Better I think...

1107
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.875
-to make you part of them.
-What?

1108
00:56:46.916 --> 00:56:48.375
No. no. no. What are you doing?

1109
00:56:48.416 --> 00:56:49.583
No. No. no. no. no.

1110
00:56:49.625 --> 00:56:50.708
You don't have to do this.

1111
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:52.500
-Engaging defence systems.
-On it.

1112
00:56:52.541 --> 00:56:55.625
We are coming for you. Max.

1113
00:56:55.666 --> 00:56:56.916
No. no!

1114
00:56:56.958 --> 00:56:59.333
Nooo!

1115
00:56:59.708 --> 00:57:03.125
His improvisation is incredible!

1116
00:57:03.333 --> 00:57:06.375
Droids... Get me the
coordinates for that wormhole.

1117
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:09.000
Yes. Master Zolthard. Sir.

1118
00:57:09.083 --> 00:57:12.000
It's only a matter of time now.

1119
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:15.750
Charlene. look. it's Hernandez.

1120
00:57:15.791 --> 00:57:18.791
And he’s right outside the door.

1121
00:57:24.833 --> 00:57:25.916
Do you think he's gone?

1122
00:57:26.041 --> 00:57:27.875
Let's take a quick peek.

1123
00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:31.208
Charlene. look!

1124
00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:35.625
-Yeah!
-Oh. oh.

1125
00:57:45.708 --> 00:57:48.000
Charlene. this door is
on it’s last legs. Is it time?

1126
00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:49.625
Not yet.

1127
00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:50.791
And now? Is it time yet now?

1128
00:57:50.833 --> 00:57:52.166
Not yet!

1129
00:57:52.375 --> 00:57:54.416
Charlene. listen.
I really think--

1130
00:57:54.458 --> 00:57:55.000
Now!

1131
00:57:55.041 --> 00:57:56.041
Oh. oh.

1132
00:57:56.083 --> 00:57:58.583
Go. go. go. go.
go. go. go.

1133
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:24.583
Guys. we've got company.

1134
00:58:25.791 --> 00:58:27.250
Oh. no.

1135
00:58:27.583 --> 00:58:28.666
Bring them on!

1136
00:58:29.083 --> 00:58:30.791
Give me that
before you hurt yourself.

1137
00:58:30.833 --> 00:58:32.666
I told you it's useless
without the power pack.

1138
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Ah. Max. talk about being in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

1139
00:58:41.333 --> 00:58:42.791
Yeah. Story of my life.

1140
00:58:42.875 --> 00:58:44.666
Look. credit where it's due.

1141
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.833
You did put up a good chase.

1142
00:58:48.208 --> 00:58:51.208
But that is all over now.

1143
00:58:51.541 --> 00:58:53.208
-Aah!
-Ooh!

1144
00:58:53.875 --> 00:58:56.458
Better run while you still can.

1145
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:59.125
Run? In my fifty years
on the job.

1146
00:58:59.166 --> 00:59:00.750
I've never run from a fight.

1147
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:02.916
Don't worry. kids.

1148
00:59:03.083 --> 00:59:04.458
This ship's hull is made from

1149
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.833
interlaced fibers
of nano-ionic alloy.

1150
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.208
Nothing can get through that.

1151
00:59:08.541 --> 00:59:10.625
Engage the Quantum Welder!

1152
00:59:11.208 --> 00:59:12.125
The what now?

1153
00:59:22.583 --> 00:59:24.708
This feels a lot like
running away. Max.

1154
00:59:27.291 --> 00:59:30.166
Why are you standing around
doing nothing?

1155
00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:32.375
Take care of Max and his crew.

1156
00:59:32.458 --> 00:59:33.500
Yes. Zolthard. Sir.

1157
00:59:33.958 --> 00:59:36.666
This isn't running.
This is a tactical withdrawal.

1158
00:59:36.708 --> 00:59:39.208
More like a tactical wussing out
if you ask me!

1159
00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:40.375
-Guys!
-I didn't

1160
00:59:40.416 --> 00:59:41.291
Brave Max.

1161
00:59:41.333 --> 00:59:42.666
-heroically leading the charge
-I'm trying to keep you from

1162
00:59:42.708 --> 00:59:43.708
-in the other direction.
-becoming a robots breakfast!

1163
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:45.125
Guys!

1164
00:59:45.416 --> 00:59:47.541
Who's driving Norman?

1165
00:59:48.083 --> 00:59:49.666
-No. no.
-What's going on there?

1166
00:59:49.708 --> 00:59:51.666
Quiet. earth worm!

1167
00:59:52.125 --> 00:59:54.666
I am trying to work.

1168
00:59:55.875 --> 00:59:57.958
Quick. in here.

1169
01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:06.916
Do you think he's gone?

1170
01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:08.250
I think so.

1171
01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:17.083
Great!
Now we're trapped backstage.

1172
01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:19.125
What better place
could there be?

1173
01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:20.375
Seriously. Alejandro?

1174
01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:22.000
Yeah. now we can arm ourselves.

1175
01:00:22.333 --> 01:00:24.291
All of this stuff
is completely fake.

1176
01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:27.458
This suit of armor.
these spears. they're not real.

1177
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:28.750
And look at this thing.

1178
01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.250
Ow.

1179
01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:31.250
Get behind me. Charlene!

1180
01:00:31.583 --> 01:00:32.625
Back. donkey. back!

1181
01:00:32.875 --> 01:00:35.708
Get away from me.

1182
01:00:37.291 --> 01:00:38.750
That sounds like
somebody I know.

1183
01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:41.916
Is that...?

1184
01:00:41.958 --> 01:00:45.000
Uh. well. if it isn't
crazy-man Mike.

1185
01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:45.916
Please don't hurt me!

1186
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.375
We are not going to hurt you.

1187
01:00:48.416 --> 01:00:50.958
Yeah. stop blubbering
and pull yourself together.

1188
01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:52.208
You mean you're not one of them?

1189
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.833
No!

1190
01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:54.000
God. great!

1191
01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:56.708
Thank goodness-- you've gotta
get me out of here!!

1192
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:58.250
They gonna take over my mind.

1193
01:00:58.541 --> 01:00:59.500
They're gonna...

1194
01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:00.791
Snap out of it. big guy.

1195
01:01:01.416 --> 01:01:03.541
Its not like you have a brain
for them to eat anyway.

1196
01:01:03.666 --> 01:01:04.791
Now take a deep breath.

1197
01:01:04.875 --> 01:01:06.333
But how are we
going to save Norman?

1198
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.000
There is a way.

1199
01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:11.458
Friends. together we will
stage the greatest

1200
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.208
theatrical diversion ever seen
in human times.

1201
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:15.458
-Huh?
-Umm?

1202
01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:17.708
This is the big time.

1203
01:01:17.791 --> 01:01:19.791
We must be sharp.
like the blade.

1204
01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:22.041
Explosive. like the grenade.

1205
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.750
We must move with style
and with sass.

1206
01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:27.041
And we must be strong.

1207
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.083
Like the ass--

1208
01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:31.250
Alejandro!

1209
01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:32.791
What?

1210
01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:36.625
Whoa!

1211
01:01:41.416 --> 01:01:44.125
Ok. Sophie. let’s do this.

1212
01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:47.250
Time to shut this baby down.

1213
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:49.416
I've got this.

1214
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.166
No problem.

1215
01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:02.416
-Sophie!
-Sophie!!

1216
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.416
Alright. step back kids.
Time to bring out the big guns.

1217
01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:08.250
Uuuuh!

1218
01:02:09.333 --> 01:02:12.500
Harder than it looks.

1219
01:02:12.625 --> 01:02:13.958
Aaaah!

1220
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.916
A little help here. Gus?

1221
01:02:15.958 --> 01:02:17.250
Oh. yeah right.

1222
01:02:17.291 --> 01:02:20.000
I've got the Control Droid's
manual right here...

1223
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:22.000
somewhere.

1224
01:02:22.625 --> 01:02:24.375
Welcome and...

1225
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
...the new D17.5 Control Droid.

1226
01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:30.666
We hope that your purchase
of our product--

1227
01:02:30.708 --> 01:02:31.708
-Gus?
-Gus!

1228
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:33.000
Okay. okay.

1229
01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:34.708
Schematics. schematics--

1230
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.375
Whoa. Sorry.

1231
01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.541
I think I broke my butt-bone.

1232
01:02:40.583 --> 01:02:41.666
Yah!

1233
01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:49.291
Gus. any help you have will be
greatly appreciated...

1234
01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:52.500
Wow. They’re even outfitted with
telescopic forearms.

1235
01:02:52.625 --> 01:02:55.458
You don't say.

1236
01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:59.375
Access to the control panel
is on the back of the head!

1237
01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:01.750
Over here. you big softy.
Hehe.

1238
01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:03.625
-Got it.
-Any time now. kids.

1239
01:03:04.416 --> 01:03:06.583
Put the blue wire in the green
socket to power down.

1240
01:03:06.625 --> 01:03:07.750
-Okay
-Uuuh!

1241
01:03:08.666 --> 01:03:10.875
Not exactly what we're
looking for. but I'll take it.

1242
01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:12.625
Okay. Try green into purple.

1243
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:13.416
Fine.

1244
01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:20.375
Don’t. Think. It’s that. One.

1245
01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:22.166
I don’t know... grey into blue?

1246
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.250
You sure?

1247
01:03:23.625 --> 01:03:25.958
Uh! Hey. I didn’t know
I could still do that.

1248
01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:28.333
I definitely can’t do that!

1249
01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:29.583
Oh. for Pete's sake.

1250
01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:31.333
Yaah!

1251
01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:37.750
Max. you okay?

1252
01:03:37.875 --> 01:03:39.041
Yeah.

1253
01:03:39.375 --> 01:03:41.041
Wow. that was rough.

1254
01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.583
Oh? Had a tough time. did you?

1255
01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:45.583
I don't think we can
do that again.

1256
01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:49.291
We might not have to.

1257
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:56.666
Guys. this power pack
is still fully charged.

1258
01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:15.291
Really. why did I agree to this?

1259
01:04:25.708 --> 01:04:27.791
Ooh.

1260
01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:29.750
Now. Control Droid!

1261
01:04:29.791 --> 01:04:32.458
Initiating
Mind Manipulation Protocol.

1262
01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:37.458
Uh. uh.

1263
01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.625
There you are. Max.

1264
01:04:41.166 --> 01:04:43.791
Your host is now mine.

1265
01:04:43.958 --> 01:04:48.083
Oh. but don’t worry.
I will take good care of it.

1266
01:04:49.458 --> 01:04:51.875
You!! Get up there.

1267
01:05:05.875 --> 01:05:08.250
I did not sign up
for this.

1268
01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:18.125
Not so fast.

1269
01:05:27.083 --> 01:05:28.333
Uhm!

1270
01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:32.208
Ooh! Aah!

1271
01:05:34.625 --> 01:05:36.791
Awe. Some.

1272
01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:38.750
Good shot. Soph.

1273
01:05:38.791 --> 01:05:41.208
Hey. look. a souvenir.

1274
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.250
Max. we've got problems.

1275
01:05:43.416 --> 01:05:45.833
What are we going to do
about those?

1276
01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:47.916
Now. get me the coordinates for
that wormhole!

1277
01:05:48.833 --> 01:05:50.083
Yes.
Master Zolthard.

1278
01:05:50.125 --> 01:05:51.500
- Five.
- What in the?!

1279
01:05:51.541 --> 01:05:53.291
-Six.
-Six.

1280
01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:56.208
-Four.
-Four.

1281
01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:58.250
-Three.
-Three.

1282
01:05:58.375 --> 01:05:59.708
Two.

1283
01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:01.166
-Seven.
-Uh-uh.

1284
01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:02.375
Two.

1285
01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:03.541
-Two.
-Five.

1286
01:06:03.583 --> 01:06:08.500
Oh. this is such a
momentous occasion.

1287
01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:13.083
I mean. it's not
every day that one successfully

1288
01:06:13.125 --> 01:06:15.416
subjugates an entire planet!

1289
01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.541
How do I get this thing
to shut up?

1290
01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:17.916
Dash.

1291
01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:18.833
Five.

1292
01:06:18.916 --> 01:06:19.500
Shut up!

1293
01:06:21.416 --> 01:06:23.291
- Five. Dash.
- Oh yeah? You want some more?

1294
01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:25.208
Three. Six.

1295
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.500
- Seven. Eight.
- Aah!

1296
01:06:29.458 --> 01:06:30.416
Four.

1297
01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:34.041
Dash. Five.
Dash. Two.

1298
01:06:34.208 --> 01:06:35.833
Heads up!

1299
01:06:37.208 --> 01:06:38.708
Five. Three.

1300
01:06:38.916 --> 01:06:40.916
Two.

1301
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:46.625
What's going on in there?

1302
01:06:52.916 --> 01:06:55.958
Oh. man. what happened.

1303
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.333
Frankie?

1304
01:06:57.541 --> 01:06:58.500
What?

1305
01:06:58.541 --> 01:07:03.333
She's trying to interfere
with my communications device.

1306
01:07:07.666 --> 01:07:09.625
Are the coordinates complete?

1307
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:11.208
Yes. Sir.

1308
01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:12.500
Then get on with it.

1309
01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:15.916
With pleasure. Sir.

1310
01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:26.541
Guys. a little help.

1311
01:07:26.583 --> 01:07:28.125
Frankie!

1312
01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:38.166
Frankie! Nooo!

1313
01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:49.083
Isn't that
magnificent?

1314
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.541
Wow. Boss. that looks great.
We did it.

1315
01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:55.666
Well. you fools
took long enough.

1316
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.916
Let's get the
Droid armies down here.

1317
01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:09.208
Oh. no.

1318
01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:12.208
Creatures from a distant galaxy.

1319
01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:15.458
You have made the grave error
of invading Earth

1320
01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:19.791
and inciting the wrath of its
Cosmic Protector.

1321
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:20.833
Huh!

1322
01:08:20.916 --> 01:08:21.875
Huh. ow!

1323
01:08:22.916 --> 01:08:24.000
Uh!

1324
01:08:24.041 --> 01:08:25.125
Stop bumping me
like that.

1325
01:08:25.166 --> 01:08:26.791
Your butt is in my face.

1326
01:08:26.916 --> 01:08:27.916
You don't
have a face.

1327
01:08:28.083 --> 01:08:29.916
Be the
donkey's butt!

1328
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:30.916
Guys!

1329
01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:32.416
-Ow.
-Ow!

1330
01:08:32.458 --> 01:08:33.916
Charge!

1331
01:08:35.875 --> 01:08:39.000
Charge!!

1332
01:08:39.208 --> 01:08:40.125
Umf!!

1333
01:08:41.416 --> 01:08:42.791
Try to stay in character.

1334
01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:44.666
No!

1335
01:08:44.833 --> 01:08:45.875
No! What?

1336
01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:47.083
What's going on?

1337
01:08:53.541 --> 01:08:54.625
Stop! Get it off me!

1338
01:08:54.666 --> 01:08:56.583
What happened?

1339
01:08:57.041 --> 01:08:58.291
What's going on?

1340
01:08:58.333 --> 01:09:00.916
Where am I?

1341
01:09:00.958 --> 01:09:02.125
Let's go. come on.

1342
01:09:10.583 --> 01:09:13.208
Go. go. go. go. go!

1343
01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.125
Huh?

1344
01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:17.791
You're mine now.

1345
01:09:18.458 --> 01:09:20.041
Heeey!

1346
01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:28.291
Can anybody hear me?
Oh. there we go.

1347
01:09:28.333 --> 01:09:30.250
Oh. no. not again!

1348
01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.166
Frankie. is that you?

1349
01:09:42.375 --> 01:09:43.416
Who else. Norman?

1350
01:09:43.458 --> 01:09:45.125
Oh. thank goodness you're okay.

1351
01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:48.250
I've uploaded the hack.
It just needs to be activated.

1352
01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:50.166
But I can't go back up there.

1353
01:09:50.708 --> 01:09:52.541
I can get you up there. Norman.

1354
01:09:52.875 --> 01:09:55.250
Follow me.
Sophie says she can help us out.

1355
01:09:55.541 --> 01:09:59.166
Oh. no. that's just perfect.

1356
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:02.375
How do we stop this?

1357
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.500
Sophie. you there?

1358
01:10:04.625 --> 01:10:06.541
Let's do this.

1359
01:10:07.583 --> 01:10:09.083
Oh. no!

1360
01:10:09.916 --> 01:10:11.666
No. no. no. no. no.
Gus. do something.

1361
01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:13.250
-Okay. I can--
-There's no time.

1362
01:10:13.291 --> 01:10:15.208
Wait. what do you mean
there's no time?

1363
01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:30.291
Norman. the signal has reached
the Mothership.

1364
01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:31.833
We need the hack. now.

1365
01:10:31.875 --> 01:10:32.791
What?

1366
01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:33.708
Who's he talking to?

1367
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.458
The voices in his head.

1368
01:10:35.791 --> 01:10:36.500
We're doomed.

1369
01:10:36.541 --> 01:10:39.208
Norman.
the Intergalactic Peaceforce

1370
01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:41.708
has entrusted us
with stopping Zolthard.

1371
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.958
The fate of the entire universe
hangs in the balance.

1372
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.208
If Zolthard’s army
reaches Earth.

1373
01:10:47.416 --> 01:10:51.375
nothing will stop him from mind
controlling everyone!

1374
01:10:51.416 --> 01:10:52.833
But I'm just a kid.

1375
01:10:52.875 --> 01:10:54.291
You're not just a kid.

1376
01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.458
You're our last and only hope.

1377
01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.166
-Norman. what's going on?
-Huh?

1378
01:10:58.541 --> 01:11:00.458
Guys. we're on our own.

1379
01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:02.291
So you are not the one!

1380
01:11:04.333 --> 01:11:07.375
Um. we gotta do something.
Guys?

1381
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.958
Ah. man.
not these two again!

1382
01:11:14.875 --> 01:11:16.250
You can do this.

1383
01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:18.625
All you have to do
is push the button.

1384
01:11:18.666 --> 01:11:20.500
We believe in you. Norman.

1385
01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:33.708
Here goes all. or nothing.

1386
01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:38.000
Hello. can anybody
hear me?

1387
01:11:38.041 --> 01:11:40.625
Help me out!

1388
01:11:41.875 --> 01:11:45.791
I was only joking earlier.
You are totally the one.

1389
01:11:51.625 --> 01:11:54.416
I can't breathe! Oh!

1390
01:11:58.041 --> 01:12:02.458
Let the invasion begin!

1391
01:12:14.333 --> 01:12:16.416
What's he doing up there?

1392
01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:18.041
Stop him!

1393
01:12:35.041 --> 01:12:37.333
Yeah! Nice shot.

1394
01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.750
Come here. you.
got you now.

1395
01:13:08.458 --> 01:13:09.500
Aah!

1396
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.125
Yeah. yeah. Go. Norman!

1397
01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:36.250
-He did it!
-Yeah. Norman!

1398
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.625
That's my boy.

1399
01:13:38.916 --> 01:13:41.750
What have you done?

1400
01:13:42.083 --> 01:13:44.791
Canceled your invasion plans.
Hope you don't mind.

1401
01:13:44.833 --> 01:13:47.250
Come here I'll tear you apart.

1402
01:13:47.291 --> 01:13:49.541
You vile creature!

1403
01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:52.583
You've ruined everything!

1404
01:13:52.625 --> 01:13:54.125
Norman! Watch out!

1405
01:14:02.083 --> 01:14:03.708
-Charlene! Come on.
-We've gotta go.

1406
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:05.125
Get out the way.

1407
01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:09.416
Oh. oh. oh. oh. Ow!

1408
01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:14.958
Come here.

1409
01:14:24.041 --> 01:14:26.500
You ruined everything!

1410
01:14:26.541 --> 01:14:28.500
Yeah. we sure did.

1411
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.416
Droids. get them!

1412
01:14:30.458 --> 01:14:33.208
I'm afraid the Droids
are currently offline.

1413
01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:34.208
What?

1414
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:35.875
It’s over. Zolthard.

1415
01:14:36.416 --> 01:14:37.833
It’s not over.

1416
01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.000
Who’s going to stop me?

1417
01:14:40.125 --> 01:14:41.750
We are.

1418
01:14:41.791 --> 01:14:43.625
You wouldn't dare.

1419
01:14:43.958 --> 01:14:46.083
Oh. no? Hm.

1420
01:14:46.875 --> 01:14:48.500
I think we've got this.

1421
01:14:58.791 --> 01:15:00.625
And you kids
are all okay. huh?

1422
01:15:00.791 --> 01:15:02.958
Yes. officer.
we're all accounted for.

1423
01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:05.500
And you say
you didn't see who did it?

1424
01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:08.083
No. Officer.
But Ms. Witherington

1425
01:15:08.125 --> 01:15:09.875
has been under a lot
of stress lately.

1426
01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:12.291
School's been crazy.

1427
01:15:12.416 --> 01:15:14.375
Yeah. Kids. huh?

1428
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.791
Yeah. we're the worst.

1429
01:15:16.125 --> 01:15:19.833
So you've told me
absolutely everything you saw?

1430
01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:21.041
Yes. Sir.

1431
01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:24.125
Well. good job. son.

1432
01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:25.333
Thank you. Officer.

1433
01:15:25.375 --> 01:15:26.875
You're a credit to Hubble Bay.

1434
01:15:26.958 --> 01:15:28.291
Oh. thank you. Officer.

1435
01:15:28.583 --> 01:15:30.250
All right. run along now.

1436
01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:31.500
Yes. Officer.

1437
01:15:34.166 --> 01:15:35.000
Are we off the hook?

1438
01:15:35.041 --> 01:15:35.375
Yeah.

1439
01:15:35.416 --> 01:15:36.875
Alright!

1440
01:15:37.083 --> 01:15:40.833
Finally! This is the big time.
Fame. fortune.

1441
01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:43.583
I can have my own show.
I can see it now.

1442
01:15:43.625 --> 01:15:46.083
"Principal Witherington
taken over by Aliens".

1443
01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:50.125
Whoa there! Humanity's not quite
ready to know about us yet.

1444
01:15:50.833 --> 01:15:52.250
Yeah.
I'd be careful who you tell.

1445
01:15:52.666 --> 01:15:54.583
Civilizations get kind of antsy

1446
01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:57.208
when it comes to
invading space alien species.

1447
01:15:57.416 --> 01:15:59.333
I don't really
feel like being dissected

1448
01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:01.083
by government scientists.

1449
01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.958
So. Principal Witherington.
tell us--

1450
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.958
Ah. that's not going to happen.

1451
01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:09.458
We're all going to have to
keep this a secret.

1452
01:16:09.625 --> 01:16:11.500
Hmm. That's a pity.

1453
01:16:11.791 --> 01:16:13.291
Or. maybe even better...

1454
01:16:13.875 --> 01:16:17.666
The selfless and the brave hero
never truly acknowledged

1455
01:16:17.708 --> 01:16:21.208
for the sacrifices he made
to save the world.

1456
01:16:22.125 --> 01:16:24.208
We know what you did. Norman.
Good job.

1457
01:16:24.833 --> 01:16:27.416
Thanks. guys. It wasn't
anything. really. I just--

1458
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:28.916
I mean it.

1459
01:16:29.375 --> 01:16:33.375
Uh. well. I couldn't
have done it without you.

1460
01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:37.750
Guys... without you guys.

1461
01:16:37.791 --> 01:16:39.083
Yeah. right?

1462
01:16:39.583 --> 01:16:42.833
Look. I don't know
what to tell you. Officer.

1463
01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:44.583
I can't remember a thing.

1464
01:16:44.875 --> 01:16:45.666
What are you doing?

1465
01:16:45.708 --> 01:16:47.833
Why are you-- don't touch me!

1466
01:16:47.875 --> 01:16:51.625
Ahh!--You-- aah! Fools-- aah!

1467
01:16:51.666 --> 01:16:54.208
What are you doing.
what are you doing?

1468
01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:56.875
Stop! Somebody. stop me!

1469
01:16:56.916 --> 01:16:59.125
Ooh!

1470
01:16:59.375 --> 01:17:01.000
And. post.

1471
01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:02.958
You think she's okay?

1472
01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:06.291
Yeah. she'll be all right.
They'll take good care of her.

1473
01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:09.583
No. no. no.
no. no. no!

1474
01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:11.750
This planet belongs to me!

1475
01:17:11.791 --> 01:17:14.041
It is mine!
I tell you. all mine!

1476
01:17:16.791 --> 01:17:18.791
You kids this to me.

1477
01:17:18.916 --> 01:17:20.041
I'm coming for you.

1478
01:17:20.125 --> 01:17:21.958
I'm gonna get you.

1479
01:17:26.791 --> 01:17:29.000
And there she goes.

1480
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.291
Somehow I don't think that's
the last we'll be seeing of her.

1481
01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:34.583
I think you're probably right.

1482
01:17:34.625 --> 01:17:37.250
So let’s go and bust her out and
arrest Zolthard.

1483
01:17:37.291 --> 01:17:38.750
Easy. Sophie.

1484
01:17:38.791 --> 01:17:40.958
Wait. are you guys
hanging around?

1485
01:17:41.333 --> 01:17:42.166
Correct.

1486
01:17:42.208 --> 01:17:45.000
Yeah. We still needed to deliver
a serious butt kicking.

1487
01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:47.250
Anyway. it’s going to be
a while until I can get

1488
01:17:47.291 --> 01:17:48.333
these thrusters working.

1489
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:51.333
It's okay with you if we
stick around for a bit. right?

1490
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:54.166
Yeah. Yeah. that's great.
I mean. cool.

1491
01:17:54.208 --> 01:17:55.791
Stay as long as you like.

1492
01:17:55.916 --> 01:17:57.166
He's doing it again.

1493
01:17:57.208 --> 01:17:59.625
This will definitely take some
getting used to.

1494
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.083
That's good to hear.

1495
01:18:02.291 --> 01:18:05.916
Right. I think we earned
ourselves a little downtime.

1496
01:18:06.041 --> 01:18:08.541
Hey. Norman. what's worth
seeing around here?

1497
01:18:08.875 --> 01:18:11.541
Guys. what can we show Max
and crew? They want to see town.

1498
01:18:12.041 --> 01:18:13.958
We could take them to
the giant ball of string.

1499
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:14.541
Oh!

1500
01:18:14.583 --> 01:18:16.166
Or the museum.

1501
01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:18.166
Guys. we've got this awesome
Egyptian exhibit

1502
01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:19.291
just down the road.
we just gotta check it out.

1503
01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:22.791
Hey. Mike.
try to keep up. okay?

1504
01:18:23.208 --> 01:18:24.125
Yeah. Okay.

1505
01:18:24.208 --> 01:18:25.541
Just think about it. because--

1506
01:18:25.583 --> 01:18:27.291
I don't want to look at a
bunch of mummies!

1507
01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:29.250
It'll be really cool.
Yeah. we've had enough about it.
