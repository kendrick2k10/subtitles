00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.080
Hi. Mum!

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Official YIFY movies site:
YTS.MX

4
00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.800
How are you?

5
00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.399
Yes. I just woke up. Last night I went
to see a movie with Daniel.

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.600
Yes. the guy who converted to Islam.

7
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.800
I don't know.

8
00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.520
It's definitely serious to him.

9
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.240
I mean. last night...

10
00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:50.359
He asked me to marry him!

11
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.120
In God's name. do you take Daniel
as your husband before God?

12
00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.680
I do.

13
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.920
In God's name. do you take Alexandra
as your wife before God?

14
00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:17.519
In God's name. I take Alexandra
as my wife before God.

15
00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.879
...and not those who run astray!

16
00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:25.680
God. bless them
with health and happiness.

17
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.200
and by Your will may they
enter Paradise together!

18
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.840
Amen!
Much happiness and 10-12 children.

19
00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.200
It's done. now they're married!

20
00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.120
Do we give her away?

21
00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.159
Brother. she fasted every single day!

22
00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:57.879
- For what?
- For Ramadan!

23
00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:01.079
- You fasted in vain.
- Thought so.

24
00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.359
It doesn't count.

25
00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.879
If you don't become a Muslim.

26
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.800
your fasting doesn't count.

27
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.240
What God wants. really.
is for you to say the words

28
00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.639
"There is no God but Allah and
Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"!

29
00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.159
- Otherwise--
- Nothing counts. right?

30
00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.800
You are lost.

31
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.439
Hell will eat you alive!

32
00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.120
I never heard someone speak Arabic.

33
00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.800
When I heard you reciting
the Qur'an and saw you praying.

34
00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.120
I didn't understand what was going on.

35
00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:50.800
Your eyes were closed. then open.
you bowed to the floor.

36
00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.039
I thought
"I never saw that in my life!"

37
00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.719
I had never seen a Muslim praying.
I didn't know how it's done.

38
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.759
Did you ever think
I could have more wives?

39
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.199
That was a tough one.

40
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.879
my muslim husband

41
00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.240
Allahu akbar!

42
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.199
Allah hears whoever praises Him.

43
00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.759
Look. Daniel is spying on us!

44
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.360
I would like to
better understand the purpose

45
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.680
for which the hijab was introduced

46
00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.400
and whether it still serves
the same purpose today.

47
00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:13.080
In short. why a Muslim woman
should wear the hijab.

48
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.720
Basically.
covering the head is mandatory.

49
00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.720
However.

50
00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.480
the way this is put to practice

51
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.759
differs from one situation to another.

52
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.560
from one context to another.

53
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.000
In Europe. let's say.

54
00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:42.160
the hijab may look different
from the ones in Muslim countries.

55
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.240
There may be small differences.
That's acceptable.

56
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.519
There are situations where
you can't wear a hijab at work.

57
00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:58.279
You put this on your forehead.

58
00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:02.639
That's ok.

59
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.199
And now you pull it up.

60
00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.360
And you pin it closed here.

61
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.040
- Like this?
- Yes.

62
00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.800
I feel so strange already!

63
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.759
You want to try this one?
You look so beautiful.

64
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.639
The hijab isn't just about
covering your head.

65
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.000
You must also have
a decent outfit. not too tight.

66
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.040
You must be modest from head to toe.

67
00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.759
The same is required of men.

68
00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:42.480
It's so pretty. just like blonde hair.

69
00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:44.759
Such a pretty little scarf.

70
00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:48.160
Look how pretty.

71
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.959
I feel like a saint.

72
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.120
I feel like I'm not allowed
to do anything wrong now.

73
00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:59.319
No. only good things.

74
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.439
You just can't!

75
00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:04.839
You can be very cheerful
and pretty with a hijab.

76
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.279
My. aren't you a pretty one.

77
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.240
They say you can't get married
if you can't cooksarmale.

78
00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.600
- Have you cooked sarmale before?
- Yes.

79
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.720
- Really. you have?
- Yes.

80
00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:30.079
When?

81
00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:35.000
One time. when I was little.

82
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.759
Love. these are the first sarmale
you've cooked for me.

83
00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.560
You'll love them.

84
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.879
I'm so proud of you!

85
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.879
Can't have Christmas
withoutsarmale !

86
00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:54.480
If you like them.
I can make them more often.

87
00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:59.720
I don't celebrate Christmas.
so any occasion is as good as the next.

88
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.560
You're saying I can cook them anytime.

89
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.720
- I should remember this.
- What?

90
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.600
No chance I'll forget this.
I've been at it all day.

91
00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:36.560
I still sometimes think that

92
00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:39.480
this whole Islam thing.

93
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.759
and how a Muslim
is supposed to behave...

94
00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.920
I don't know if I...

95
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.000
I hope I can adapt
to everything it involves.

96
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.120
This is very new to me.

97
00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:59.279
I don't know if I will like all of it.

98
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.959
My biggest fear

99
00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:22.560
is about how we'll manage to...

100
00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:28.759
to maintain a good relationship
with my parents.

101
00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.959
Why would you have any doubts?

102
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.600
Past behaviour.

103
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.559
Meaning?

104
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.320
Meaning that it happened before.

105
00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:48.919
Not meeting their expectations.

106
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.159
- Stop thinking about that!
- Oh well.

107
00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:56.639
This time it will be different!

108
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.360
- In sha'Allah.
- Stop thinking about it.

109
00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:07.759
I didn't put on any make-up.
just a little concealer around the eyes.

110
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.559
- That's all.
- It's still noticeable.

111
00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:16.440
What. the make-up or
the lack of bags under my eyes?

112
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.159
Just a little.

113
00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:25.360
What do you see?

114
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.639
You are very beautiful.

115
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.240
- Which part?
- All of you.

116
00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:30.960
Right or left?

117
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.639
It makes no sense. why do
people in Mecca fast 12 hours a day.

118
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.919
but if you're in Europe.
in the Nordic countries.

119
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.240
you fast for 18-19 hours a day?

120
00:09:58.279 --> 00:10:02.759
- Why can't we do the same?
- Six hours is a big difference.

121
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.919
Then we should fast
the way they do in Mecca.

122
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.240
I don't want to do it wrong.

123
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.240
but I also don't want to be in this state
where I'm like a vegetable.

124
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.039
So what's best. doing the full fast
and feeling like a vegetable.

125
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.519
or fasting for less time.
but still being able to be productive?

126
00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:27.240
It depends on the sun.
I can't just make my own religion.

127
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.559
After a good night's sleep.

128
00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:12.120
you wake up with fresh thoughts.

129
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.879
and the brain...

130
00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:19.840
The brain is...

131
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.399
How to put it?

132
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.639
You still think you can have
a good relationship with them?

133
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.399
Isn't it very sad.
not getting along with your own parents?

134
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.879
No! You can't have that
if you live in their house.

135
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.559
Why can't you see that?

136
00:11:38.919 --> 00:11:41.720
This is normal.
didn't you read the Qur'an?

137
00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:44.799
It says you have to be
independent from your parents!

138
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.639
Does it say you should
live with your parents until 40?

139
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.080
- No.
- See?

140
00:11:55.159 --> 00:11:59.159
Daniel. I told you time and again
if we live here. there will be trouble.

141
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.679
I begged you to find
a new place. to move.

142
00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:05.200
We knew it would come to this.

143
00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:09.320
What made you think
it would turn out different?

144
00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:12.279
See it as a way of
protecting your parents.

145
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.720
Since they won't be happy
with any partner of yours.

146
00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:19.480
you can't possibly
share a house with them.

147
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.879
They didn't like it
when you were single either.

148
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.200
Their problem is with you. not me.

149
00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:28.360
Yes. that's true.

150
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.679
I've never offended or disobeyed them.

151
00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:34.720
I've always respected them.
given them space.

152
00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:37.000
I never fought with them.

153
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.240
I tried to be beyond any reproach.

154
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.159
I tried to be unbiased towards them.

155
00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:46.600
I swallowed my pride for them.

156
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.559
You fight with them
and they give me shit.

157
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.120
When you go one way
and you hit a wall.

158
00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:22.360
and it happens again. and again. and
again. shouldn't you change direction?

159
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.240
Doesn't it mean that road is closed?

160
00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:37.960
Alright. we move out as soon as we can.

161
00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:42.679
And. yes. I knew all these things.

162
00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:44.799
I was naive.

163
00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:54.120
Please. calm down.

164
00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.080
I love you.

165
00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:25.559
Make sure the chickens don't get out
and do exactly as I did!

166
00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:28.639
- Alright.
- Dig out the horseradish.

167
00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:05.879
Don't pack so many eggs for me.

168
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.000
- I have plenty.
- Keep some for yourself!

169
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.240
The chickens will start moulting soon.

170
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.000
- So keep some.
- They're not moulting yet.

171
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.200
They've been laying a lot.

172
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.399
- I thought you'd be pregnant by now.
- God willing!

173
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.279
We don't need to hurry.

174
00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:33.679
Grandma.
why should we have children?

175
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.480
So she has heirs.

176
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.759
Don't say that!

177
00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:40.720
You!

178
00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:42.559
No. he's just asking.

179
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.120
- What for?
- Why. you...

180
00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:48.039
- Wretched the childless!
- Why?

181
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.360
They leave nothing behind!

182
00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:52.279
Some leave knowledge.

183
00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:55.480
- Like how?
- In a book. maybe.

184
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.919
Don't say that. Daniel!

185
00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:00.919
Do you even know
how much you'll love your child?

186
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:06.320
- I'd be so happy if you had one or two.
- I could write a book instead.

187
00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:10.840
The childless are wretched!

188
00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:15.279
- Others have 3 or 4 of them.
- So? It's not mandatory.

189
00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:18.120
- You don't want children?
- Not right now.

190
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.799
- You neither?
- I do.

191
00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:23.279
- No. I do.
- Do you?

192
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.320
Yes. two at least.

193
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.360
- At least!
- Two?

194
00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:31.399
One girl. one boy.

195
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.919
- I want to see them before I die!
- You will.

196
00:16:36.159 --> 00:16:38.320
But you set conditions for me.

197
00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:45.240
You only want a child if I guarantee
I'll stay home and not travel.

198
00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:47.840
Didn't you want the same thing?

199
00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:50.480
You keep saying this.
but with conditions.

200
00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:53.039
Conditions we both agree on!

201
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.879
- You said you wanted the same thing!
- And I do!

202
00:16:57.399 --> 00:17:01.799
But I can't swear
I'll never travel anywhere again.

203
00:17:02.159 --> 00:17:03.960
No one said you should.

204
00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:08.000
It was about having a job here.
not having to travel all the time.

205
00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:12.359
How long do you think
it's OK to be away?

206
00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:18.039
- It depends on--
- On the project?

207
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.920
Do you find this normal?
Being away 8 times a year?

208
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.039
Two weeks each time?

209
00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:28.200
If you think that's OK.
let's have a child.

210
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.039
This isn't about me setting conditions.

211
00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:35.039
it's about you
spending time with your child.

212
00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:36.880
So I'm setting conditions?

213
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.720
Because I want my family close?
Well. excuse me!

214
00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:43.559
You tell me how you see it.

215
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.359
I converted in Romania.
but I truly understood Islam after I left.

216
00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.440
I see.

217
00:17:56.359 --> 00:18:00.720
There. I saw families
that were so close. so tight-knit.

218
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.640
They had many children. too.

219
00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:10.440
It's lovely to see a family of 20
around the table during Ramadan.

220
00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:15.519
I was thinking.
I don't celebrate Christmas and Easter.

221
00:18:15.599 --> 00:18:18.279
which to them were essential.

222
00:18:18.359 --> 00:18:24.559
those holiday times
during which families come together.

223
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:31.880
They felt it too.
and I felt a stranger in my own country.

224
00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:38.559
It was one of the effects
of my conversion.

225
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.519
It put a barrier.
a chasm between us.

226
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.519
I'm sure they feel like
they've lost me since then.

227
00:18:50.079 --> 00:18:55.200
I think. for them.
that's when this separation started.

228
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.960
And now it got this serious.

229
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.119
How's your health?

230
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.920
Good. and how is the family?

231
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.240
We are all good.

232
00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:35.680
and we miss you!

233
00:19:36.039 --> 00:19:40.200
We plan to visit you
this winter. but God knows.

234
00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.839
We will speak again. with God's will!

235
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.839
Again?

236
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.799
I wanted to tell you something.

237
00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:53.039
I'm going to the warm countries!

238
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.240
No. Mum. not forever!

239
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.480
Daniel wants to show me Jordan

240
00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:06.839
and various places out there.

241
00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:33.599
The people here are kind.

242
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.160
I've had many nice experiences
in Jordan.

243
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.839
Before the wars around here.
Jordan was very different.

244
00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.920
When I first came here.
the war in Syria hadn't begun.

245
00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.640
It was much better.

246
00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:57.119
Everything was cheaper.

247
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.759
people were much kinder.
more generous.

248
00:21:00.839 --> 00:21:02.519
How far to Syria?

249
00:21:02.839 --> 00:21:04.319
100 kilometres.

250
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.359
- They never get bombed by accident?
- They do.

251
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.400
I'm glad we're here.

252
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.759
I'm always happy when I come to Jordan.

253
00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:24.119
- I hope the war never gets here.
- Good luck hoping.

254
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.039
- I don't want to imagine it.
- Hoping won't help.

255
00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:32.279
Why not consider it.
since it could happen?

256
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.759
You can't know it will.

257
00:21:34.839 --> 00:21:38.640
Still. you can't think
"Oh. war will never come here."

258
00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:42.559
"Even though it's raging
just a stone's throw from here."

259
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.519
O Prophet. peace be upon you.
O Messenger. peace be upon you.

260
00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:55.559
O Beloved. peace be upon you.

261
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.640
May Allah's blessing be upon you.

262
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.240
Our Lord! send amongst them
a Messenger of their own

263
00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:23.160
who shall rehearse Thy Signs to them

264
00:22:23.599 --> 00:22:28.400
and instruct them
in Scripture and Wisdom--

265
00:22:29.119 --> 00:22:33.279
-And purify them.
-And purify them.

266
00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:37.920
For Thou art
the Exalted in Might. the Wise.

267
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.079
So. love.

268
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.079
Welcome to Jordan.

269
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.319
You can leave the camera there.

270
00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:06.359
Where it totally doesn't smell of gas.
And it's not cold.

271
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.960
Totally not dirty either. yay!

272
00:23:10.759 --> 00:23:12.240
Let's party!

273
00:23:57.519 --> 00:24:00.240
- Are you cold?
- No. just my legs.

274
00:24:03.759 --> 00:24:06.119
Why don't you put on an extra layer?

275
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.839
- Can't manage with your scarf?
- I always pull it too tight.

276
00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:49.839
Theirs look loose.
I don't know how they do it.

277
00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:52.359
You'll learn. love.

278
00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:55.680
See. they only wrap one end around!

279
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.799
All of them.

280
00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:05.640
How do you feel wearing the scarf here?

281
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.160
Normal.

282
00:25:08.839 --> 00:25:12.079
Here. I'd feel odd
if I wasn't wearing one.

283
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.039
So the place gives you motivation?

284
00:25:15.359 --> 00:25:16.559
A lot.

285
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.599
Here. if you see someone
without a scarf. you do a double-take.

286
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.039
"Why isn't she wearing one?"

287
00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:54.920
He told me to try cow's tongue.

288
00:25:56.319 --> 00:25:59.160
"Coffee" isqahuwa.

289
00:25:59.799 --> 00:26:04.200
-Qahuwati . "your coffee". for women.
- Andqahuwatuke for men.

290
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:23.519
...not of those who have earned
Your anger or of those who are astray.

291
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.759
Amen.

292
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:37.480
Remember. O Prophet.
when your Lord said to the angels.

293
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.240
"I am going to create a human being

294
00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:43.519
"from sounding clay moulded
from black mud."

295
00:26:43.599 --> 00:26:47.519
I believe that
each woman deserves a man.

296
00:26:48.759 --> 00:26:51.119
Why does she deserve a man?

297
00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:54.039
Is he a piece of cake?

298
00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:56.079
To cut it?

299
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.559
No. he's a man.
He can give her...

300
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.839
He can give another one the same.

301
00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.519
The Prophet had 13 women!

302
00:27:03.599 --> 00:27:06.839
- Not at the same time.
- Yeah. the same time!

303
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.440
Yes. Prophet Muhammad
had 13 wives

304
00:27:11.079 --> 00:27:16.759
and he treated all good.
and he loved them all together.

305
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.720
He can do that.

306
00:27:19.079 --> 00:27:22.720
The man. God created him
to love four women.

307
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.359
Yes. yes. God created him like that.

308
00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:31.079
Every woman must believe that

309
00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.640
and not discuss
anything more about this matter.

310
00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:38.200
Do you believe
you can love four women?

311
00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:39.279
Yeah!

312
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.039
I told you!

313
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.319
But why is it like this?

314
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.400
Why do all men--

315
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.279
No. who told you all men? No.

316
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:56.799
Our fathers. our uncles.
they didn't love anyone else.

317
00:27:57.759 --> 00:27:59.599
Except our mothers.

318
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.640
They didn't. Why?

319
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.880
Because our mothers were
very gentle. very good. very nice

320
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.440
for the husband.

321
00:28:10.039 --> 00:28:12.359
Maybe she didn't know how. or...

322
00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.440
She didn't know
how to treat him like this.

323
00:28:17.519 --> 00:28:20.960
They were not created
to love four women?

324
00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:22.799
No. no.

325
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.279
You can't love four men. can you?

326
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.799
It's hard to love one!

327
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.640
It's good to love one!

328
00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.880
I like it when it's louder.

329
00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:47.440
This is one of the things
I missed the most.

330
00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:50.359
Hearing the Adhan?

331
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.920
Yes.

332
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.440
May the peace and mercy
of Allah be with you.

333
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.599
May the peace and mercy
of Allah be with you.

334
00:29:12.079 --> 00:29:14.000
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

335
00:29:25.079 --> 00:29:26.920
I don't get it.

336
00:29:27.839 --> 00:29:29.559
Why do you feel ugly?

337
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.119
The very purpose of the hijab
is to cover your beauty.

338
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.240
so you don't draw the attention
of other men. that's the idea.

339
00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:40.720
That's not true.
you don't have to feel ugly.

340
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:46.759
Love. you wear the hijab
to hide from the gaze of men.

341
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.720
Right.

342
00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.559
- Does that make sense?
- Of ocurse.

343
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.680
I don't think you're ugly
with a scarf over your head.

344
00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.599
Then it's all good.

345
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.720
I can't find you ugly.

346
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.839
How are you feeling?

347
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.079
Wonderful!

348
00:30:19.799 --> 00:30:21.640
What am I supposed to say?

349
00:30:25.079 --> 00:30:29.480
If you don't want to have children
in Jordan. why not move away?

350
00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:32.359
Isn't that what we're trying to do?

351
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.519
You said you like it here.

352
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.799
For now. I like it here.

353
00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:40.440
Do we have a choice?

354
00:30:40.519 --> 00:30:42.920
We can go anywhere we want.

355
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.359
You tell me.
what are our choices now?

356
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.880
Rather than getting
cold sores from head to toe.

357
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.720
I'd rather go home and have my peace.

358
00:30:57.359 --> 00:31:00.200
Don't tell me you want to stay.

359
00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:03.279
I didn't say that. I just
don't want to go back home!

360
00:31:03.599 --> 00:31:06.319
- We'll have to go back.
- Only to visit.

361
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.359
- No. not to visit.
- Why. then?

362
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.920
Many reasons.
For one. I miss my family.

363
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.400
Also my contracts.
We have to go back soon.

364
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.119
You think I'm happy
in this dingy apartment?

365
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.920
But it's all we have now.

366
00:31:28.359 --> 00:31:31.720
We should be glad
we have each other.

367
00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:35.000
- I'm glad for that.
- Me too. Come here.

368
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.880
You don't want?

369
00:32:23.119 --> 00:32:24.960
You finished with this? Not yet?

370
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.200
Not yet. but you can take it.

371
00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:30.160
You can take it.
I can cut it in my hand.

372
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.440
No problem.

373
00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:02.000
Usually people who decide to do
home schooling do it themselves.

374
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.720
All this travel
from one place to another...

375
00:33:10.079 --> 00:33:13.400
Being in Romania. at the beginning.
this was 10 years ago.

376
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.640
In 2009.

377
00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:24.119
I converted there.
I was fasting the first Ramadan.

378
00:33:24.599 --> 00:33:26.200
Well. half of it there.

379
00:33:26.279 --> 00:33:28.039
And after the second Ramadan.

380
00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.720
I was very...

381
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.720
...confused in Romania.

382
00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.240
Why?

383
00:33:35.319 --> 00:33:38.519
Because all my friends
told me that I was crazy.

384
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.640
My family also was
totally against this idea.

385
00:33:44.519 --> 00:33:47.920
They were scared somebody would
wash my brain and I would...

386
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.759
become a terrorist.

387
00:33:49.839 --> 00:33:52.440
That is the idea about Islam in Romania

388
00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:53.880
So I said. OK.

389
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.920
I like the Qur'an very much
and I want to learn more.

390
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.519
So I came to Jordan.

391
00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.279
Here I heard all the different kinds of...

392
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.599
of ideologies. oftariqa.

393
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.719
I was starting from Salafi. Sufism...

394
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.119
All opportunities which I had
to go and learn something about Islam.

395
00:34:14.599 --> 00:34:15.639
I was there.

396
00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.159
You don't have to judge.

397
00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:22.519
tell anybody "you will go to Hell
because you are not like me."

398
00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:26.840
Who are...
Who are we to judge anyone?

399
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.840
Of course.

400
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.239
Film them. not me!

401
00:34:59.559 --> 00:35:01.280
I'm filming them too.

402
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.280
- I'm glad we came.
- Isn't it awesome?

403
00:35:45.679 --> 00:35:49.360
- Who would have thought?
- I never imagined a place like this.

404
00:35:50.039 --> 00:35:54.199
This place exceeded my expectations.

405
00:35:56.159 --> 00:35:57.800
In so many ways.

406
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.480
Stop asking me why
I'm wearing the hijab. I have no idea.

407
00:36:18.599 --> 00:36:20.320
How are you feeling in it?

408
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.360
Ugly.

409
00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.440
- Then why wear it?
- No idea.

410
00:36:25.159 --> 00:36:27.639
Sometimes I feel pretty.
sometimes ugly.

411
00:36:28.039 --> 00:36:29.679
But that's not why I wear it.

412
00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:35.960
Doesn't beauty come from inside?

413
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.920
Yes. but I still don't know
why I'm wearing the hijab.

414
00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.280
Maybe I'm trying to be more
respectful to people in these countries.

415
00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:11.280
Allahu akbar!

416
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:26.360
It woke me up.
I had a nightmare because of it!

417
00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.480
- I like it very much.
- It's not normal!

418
00:37:29.559 --> 00:37:34.719
Maybe other people don't want
to hear the town booming with it at noon.

419
00:37:35.039 --> 00:37:38.199
I don't find that normal.

420
00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.840
You're supposed to know when to pray
without that song shaking the walls.

421
00:37:44.159 --> 00:37:47.039
I find the atmosphere helps.
Others do. too.

422
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.159
Sure. it helps them a lot.
with all these wars around!

423
00:37:50.239 --> 00:37:52.679
This faith has helped them so much!

424
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.760
How does it help this nation.
this country?

425
00:37:57.079 --> 00:37:59.320
Half the globe is at war.

426
00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:10.280
I change every day.

427
00:38:12.159 --> 00:38:14.000
Everyone changes every day.

428
00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:16.880
I change every day too.

429
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.559
It's normal.
Change is part of our evolution.

430
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.920
How many kilos are we allowed?

431
00:38:39.719 --> 00:38:40.639
Eight.

432
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.880
It's been forever. you strangers!

433
00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:25.840
You forgot your poor old mum and dad.

434
00:39:30.119 --> 00:39:32.239
I was forced to go to church.

435
00:39:32.559 --> 00:39:34.960
Who forced you? God?

436
00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:38.559
People kept sending me to church.
but I'm not religious.

437
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.760
Then you still have some work to do. son.

438
00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.199
- This chapter isn't finished.
- I only believe in God. not in priests.

439
00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.360
Who believes in priests?

440
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.280
See how it comes to conflicts?

441
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.440
How?

442
00:39:58.039 --> 00:40:01.519
Because each person
fights for their point of view.

443
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.039
Talking religion gets you nowhere.

444
00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:07.000
People stick to their point of view

445
00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:10.840
and they defend it to the bitter end.

446
00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.599
Everyone sticks to their own.

447
00:40:17.079 --> 00:40:19.880
So it's best not to mention religion.

448
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.159
Not true!

449
00:40:21.239 --> 00:40:24.440
With my friends.
I could talk religion until morning.

450
00:40:24.519 --> 00:40:27.559
We'd ask
"Why is God so and so?" until dawn.

451
00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:30.000
We never reached a consensus.

452
00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:32.599
- This subject is--
- Taboo!

453
00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:36.880
It's to live and die for.
we're born with it.

454
00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.880
You can't avoid it.
God help you if you do.

455
00:40:41.679 --> 00:40:44.320
"God help you" is about faith too.

456
00:40:45.039 --> 00:40:48.119
God help you if don't believe!

457
00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.440
I just said I believe.

458
00:40:50.519 --> 00:40:52.679
You just can't get it right!

459
00:40:53.039 --> 00:40:55.679
Did I say I wanted water in my wine?

460
00:40:56.519 --> 00:40:59.719
- What's this?
- Red wine and water.

461
00:41:00.199 --> 00:41:01.840
And what did I say?

462
00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.800
- Red wine and water.
- I said white. no water.

463
00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.840
You brought me the exact opposite!

464
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:15.280
To us. One means One. God can't be
both in Earth and in Heaven.

465
00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.800
both spirit and flesh.

466
00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:21.599
Yes. God is God and the
Son of God is the Son of God.

467
00:41:22.719 --> 00:41:27.480
I respect you and
I don't want to start a polemic.

468
00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:34.239
Through your culture and education
you can try to convince me.

469
00:41:34.639 --> 00:41:36.760
It's not that you're against me.

470
00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.800
you can just try to explain.

471
00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.480
bring arguments to show
what I'm saying is wrong.

472
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.800
Actually. what Orthodox Christianity says.

473
00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.480
Not me personally.

474
00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.920
I understand. but after being
a Christian for so many years.

475
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.840
being educated as one--

476
00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.320
You mean an
Eastern Orthodox Christian.

477
00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.039
To me. Christianity is all the same.

478
00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:05.679
Orthodox. Catholic. Baptist. Pentecostal.

479
00:42:06.159 --> 00:42:10.320
Any religion believing in Jesus
and celebrating Christmas and Easter

480
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:11.920
is Christian.

481
00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:21.159
So do they pray
morning. noon. and evening?

482
00:42:21.719 --> 00:42:24.480
Five times. they're compulsory.

483
00:42:29.039 --> 00:42:31.440
Don't they have jobs?

484
00:42:32.639 --> 00:42:37.119
The Qur'an says work is important
and you shouldn't be lazy.

485
00:42:37.199 --> 00:42:41.119
You keep it balanced.
Work with 10-minute prayer breaks.

486
00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.239
Then it's back to work.

487
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.360
They don't pray all day long.

488
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.880
They need to support their families too.

489
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.000
I see.

490
00:42:53.679 --> 00:42:57.159
Serves you right.
Told you not to go outside.

491
00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:00.519
You did it to yourself.

492
00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.639
Happy holidays!

493
00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:10.599
Thank you.

494
00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.000
Alif Lam Mim.

495
00:43:26.599 --> 00:43:30.039
This Book. there is
no doubt in it. is a guide

496
00:43:30.599 --> 00:43:34.000
to those who guard against evil.

497
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.320
Those who believe in the unseen...

498
00:43:48.719 --> 00:43:50.159
It's so big.

499
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.159
Got your desk?

500
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.000
Now I can get down to work!

501
00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.599
- Get cracking!
- Alhamdulillah.

502
00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:10.440
- After a well-earned break.
- Want coffee?

503
00:44:20.639 --> 00:44:21.960
Show it to the camera.

504
00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.239
Are you alright?

505
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.639
This can hold me. I don't know about you.

506
00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.199
I used to jump down as a kid.

507
00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.559
You're not a kid anymore.
Pass the camera.

508
00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:09.880
Just go on.

509
00:45:16.079 --> 00:45:17.039
There.

510
00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.800
Do we carry these over?

511
00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.119
- To the stable?
- Yes. put it down there.

512
00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.760
I'll just go out.

513
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.559
She doesn't like her.

514
00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:57.800
She says you should leave her
and find a nice girl.

515
00:45:58.159 --> 00:46:04.239
She has a friend with
a 24-year-old daughter for you.

516
00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.159
She thinks Alexandra is lazy.

517
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.239
That's not true. Grandma.

518
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.760
She did the same
with my previous marriage.

519
00:46:16.079 --> 00:46:18.039
It's always the same.

520
00:46:18.519 --> 00:46:19.880
Know what I mean?

521
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.599
- She heard she's a Gypsy.
- That's not true!

522
00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.840
That's what she says!

523
00:46:28.239 --> 00:46:29.519
She also says...

524
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.760
You know what?
I'm done talking.

525
00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.239
In the name of God
the Merciful. the Compassionate.

526
00:46:41.719 --> 00:46:44.480
The Entirely Merciful.
the Especially Merciful.

527
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:49.239
Sovereign of the Day of Recompense.

528
00:47:10.199 --> 00:47:14.679
I told you we can't be happy
until your parents accept us!

529
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.599
I told you a thousand times!

530
00:47:25.559 --> 00:47:27.280
So what do you suggest?

531
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.559
You're abandoning us. Daniel!
I hope you're proud of yourself!

532
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:35.440
Tell her the truth:
I don't want to see her again!

533
00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:37.000
Leave her!

534
00:47:37.079 --> 00:47:38.119
What?

535
00:47:38.599 --> 00:47:41.000
Leave her! Divorce her.

536
00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.639
That girl is sick!

537
00:47:44.119 --> 00:47:47.559
Send her back to her Gypsy mother.

538
00:47:48.159 --> 00:47:50.079
She's not fit for you.

539
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.159
And how do you know she's a Gypsy?

540
00:47:55.039 --> 00:47:56.239
She is!

541
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.639
- Why do--
- Everyone knows!

542
00:47:58.719 --> 00:48:02.440
All of Cluj knows she's a Gypsy.

543
00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.199
She's a sick Gypsy
who can't have children!

544
00:48:06.519 --> 00:48:08.719
Send her back to her Gypsies!

545
00:48:09.079 --> 00:48:12.480
Mark my words.
if you don't divorce her.

546
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.159
you're not inheriting a dime!

547
00:48:17.159 --> 00:48:19.679
Fine. they can keep their fortune.

548
00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:25.159
I want Romanian grandchildren.
not Gypsies.

549
00:48:25.239 --> 00:48:30.880
She'll put everything in her name
and you'll be left with nothing.

550
00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.079
Divorce her. do you hear me?

551
00:48:33.159 --> 00:48:35.480
Very nice. what can I say.

552
00:48:38.039 --> 00:48:39.639
How very interesting.

553
00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.760
Can you hear me?

554
00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.440
Hello?

555
00:48:58.679 --> 00:49:01.679
You're upset.
I'm upset that you're upset.

556
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.440
and our life is a constant struggle.

557
00:49:06.599 --> 00:49:10.960
I'm not happy. you're not happy.
your family is not happy.

558
00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:20.679
We live in constant misery.
I don't know how long I can keep it up.

559
00:49:32.239 --> 00:49:36.599
But you still think
we're the ones at fault.

560
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.039
If you believe that.
you should know what the fault is!

561
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.639
Tell me what I'm doing wrong
so I can fix it!

562
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.079
If there's something wrong.
let's fix it!

563
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:54.360
You can't say "we're all guilty"
and wait for things to work out!

564
00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.719
If you still think we're all at fault.

565
00:49:59.039 --> 00:50:01.400
let's see what we should do!

566
00:50:04.719 --> 00:50:05.719
Come again?

567
00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:09.639
I just think problems are
solved with calm and patience.

568
00:50:09.719 --> 00:50:11.480
- Like what?
- Everything.

569
00:50:11.559 --> 00:50:14.079
What does that have to do
with our discussion?

570
00:50:14.639 --> 00:50:16.840
Well. if we're to...

571
00:50:18.039 --> 00:50:19.880
Let's just think a little.

572
00:50:25.679 --> 00:50:27.599
What's the difference

573
00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.760
between being at fault
and not being at fault?

574
00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:36.199
None.

575
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.480
Goodnight.

576
00:50:44.519 --> 00:50:47.880
- Answer me.
- I said all I had to say.

577
00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.599
- Love--
- I'm done.

578
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.039
Well. maybe...

579
00:50:56.039 --> 00:50:57.960
I don't know. Alexandra.

580
00:50:58.559 --> 00:51:01.840
I can't keep doing this. it's pointless.

581
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:45.960
Alex!

582
00:51:56.639 --> 00:51:57.800
How are you?

583
00:51:59.239 --> 00:52:00.960
Are you coming down?

584
00:52:05.719 --> 00:52:09.320
"We don't go to bed angry!"
Were you aware I was upset?

585
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:14.559
What did you do?
You tried to reach out. but couldn't?

586
00:52:14.639 --> 00:52:16.719
You "tried"?
Freaking amazing!

587
00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.320
I was a bit miffed that you got angry.

588
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.480
- You're the one who's miffed?
- What's the point of this?

589
00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:27.519
What do you mean.
what's the point?

590
00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.960
We have to solve the issue
once and for all!

591
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.800
What's the point of these arguments?

592
00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:37.719
The point is for you to understand!

593
00:52:38.119 --> 00:52:44.079
So we're not back to the same shit
day after day. forever!

594
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:49.360
Is it so hard to love a woman?

595
00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:53.000
When all she asks for is some comfort?

596
00:52:53.079 --> 00:52:56.440
At least a kiss.
it's all she asks!

597
00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.400
If you've made her upset.
at least go hug her!

598
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.559
How many times
do I have to explain?

599
00:53:03.639 --> 00:53:08.199
How proud can you be.
letting me lie there like a rag?

600
00:53:08.559 --> 00:53:11.159
After what happened the other day!

601
00:53:11.239 --> 00:53:16.199
You're too proud to do anything!
And then you blame it all on me!

602
00:53:17.599 --> 00:53:20.880
Why do we have to go through this?

603
00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:51.039
I gather you're leaving for a long time.
since you're taking all your teas.

604
00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.440
You really had to empty out
the fridge and pantry?

605
00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:02.519
Don't worry. I've left you enough.

606
00:54:03.079 --> 00:54:05.400
So you're not coming back
anytime soon?

607
00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.559
- That garbage won't take itself out.
- Say what?

608
00:54:12.679 --> 00:54:16.159
- What were you saying?
- You didn't even take out the garbage.

609
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:20.400
I will. don't worry.
I'm sure I'm capable.

610
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.800
I've done a lot today.
in case you haven't noticed.

611
00:54:27.239 --> 00:54:31.599
- Now you can do whatever you want.
- I could do that before too.

612
00:54:36.079 --> 00:54:39.400
I'll have time
to take out the garbage too.

613
00:55:07.159 --> 00:55:09.760
- What now?
- It's my home too.

614
00:55:10.199 --> 00:55:14.559
- If it's yours. live in it!
- I can come and go whenever I want.

615
00:55:15.239 --> 00:55:16.480
- Really?
- Yes.

616
00:55:21.559 --> 00:55:25.000
What am I supposed to understand?
Where are you going?

617
00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:28.239
- I'm still considering.
- Considering?

618
00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:32.480
Why do you ask.
you won't let me in next time?

619
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.760
I might just not.

620
00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:39.079
I'll come with someone
to pick up my stuff.

621
00:55:39.599 --> 00:55:42.199
I won't stop you. don't worry.

622
00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.559
Even if we break up.
I don't want us to sink so low.

623
00:55:45.639 --> 00:55:47.480
I sure hope so.

624
00:55:48.639 --> 00:55:51.039
So are we breaking up. Alexandra?

625
00:57:10.039 --> 00:57:12.519
It's a risky bet. attempting this.

626
00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:16.159
Saying "we'll cut all ties with them"

627
00:57:16.239 --> 00:57:18.719
would endanger your relationship

628
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.639
and make you feel guilty
for abandoning your parents.

629
00:57:22.719 --> 00:57:25.440
- That's what Alexandra wants.
- No!

630
00:57:25.519 --> 00:57:28.280
I just want to hear that you love me!

631
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:32.159
I've never heard you tell her
"Mum. I love my wife."

632
00:57:32.239 --> 00:57:34.960
Not once have I heard you say that!

633
00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:42.599
A difficult situation.
Daniel. you have my sympathy.

634
00:57:43.039 --> 00:57:47.719
You're between a rock and a hard place.
Whatever you do. someone suffers.

635
00:57:48.119 --> 00:57:50.280
I'm just tired of it.

636
00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:56.199
On Sunday. when I saw Alexandra
being so hurt. blowing up in anger.

637
00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:59.400
when I saw how much this bothers her...

638
00:58:00.679 --> 00:58:03.400
I don't know how to make it right.

639
00:58:04.199 --> 00:58:08.360
Daniel. you are free.
You are not in prison anymore.

640
00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:13.760
You are no longer a prisoner.
You are a free man.

641
00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.239
The price of freedom is responsibility.

642
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:22.159
Being free. we are responsible
for all we do with our freedom.

643
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:27.840
Parental love can get in the way
of your freedom regarding relationships.

644
00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.039
There. you need to draw a line:

645
00:58:30.519 --> 00:58:34.639
I am a grown-up.
It will be hard for her to accept.

646
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:39.519
You will always be her baby.
her one-year old. her toddler.

647
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:41.440
It's how a mother thinks.

648
00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:44.559
You need to show her:
"I am man now."

649
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.800
"I am in a relationship
with someone I love."

650
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:54.360
"Please. for my sake.
respect this person."

651
00:58:54.719 --> 00:58:56.079
You know what I mean?

652
00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:12.360
Please decide
what's best for my wife and me

653
00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:16.119
and if this marriage is good for us.

654
00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.840
If You believe we can
have a happy marriage

655
00:59:21.239 --> 00:59:22.719
bless it in Your name.

656
00:59:23.079 --> 00:59:25.280
To be an example among people.

657
00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.360
Our Lord. give us joy
in our spouses and children.

658
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:33.360
Make us good examples
to those who are aware of You.

659
00:59:33.719 --> 00:59:35.440
If it is possible.

660
00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.280
please smoothen
the path of our marriage.

661
00:59:40.079 --> 00:59:43.039
Help us get over our difficulties

662
00:59:43.119 --> 00:59:46.239
and find a way
of communication and understanding.

663
00:59:46.599 --> 00:59:47.679
If not...

664
00:59:49.679 --> 00:59:53.199
Give us both what is better for us.

665
00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:57.039
Please make this separation easy.

666
00:59:57.119 --> 01:00:00.000
And help us continue our lives.

667
01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.480
Amen.

668
01:00:01.559 --> 01:00:04.360
There is no God but Allah.
with no partner or associate.

669
01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.559
To Him belongs
Sovereignty and Praise.

670
01:00:06.639 --> 01:00:08.639
He gives life and causes death.

671
01:00:56.039 --> 01:00:58.920
Here I am at your service.
O God. here I am.

672
01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:04.440
To You alone is all praise
and all excellence.

673
01:01:04.519 --> 01:01:05.760
and to You is all sovereignty.

674
01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.800
There is no partner to You.

675
01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.360
Here I am at your service.
O God. here I am.

676
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.599
You have no other partners.

677
01:01:33.559 --> 01:01:36.159
Allahu akbar!

678
01:01:44.519 --> 01:01:48.840
I bear witness
that there is no god but Allah.

679
01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.880
I'm so happy to hear it. love!
Alhamdulillah!

680
01:02:55.519 --> 01:02:58.719
I feel we've learned something from this.

681
01:03:00.239 --> 01:03:01.800
How do you feel?

682
01:03:04.599 --> 01:03:09.719
We'll meet in a few days.in sha'Allah.
I miss you so much!

683
01:03:13.159 --> 01:03:17.840
I would really like for us to
see these places together. too.

684
01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:20.960
I really would.

685
01:03:24.639 --> 01:03:26.079
Alright. Love...

686
01:03:27.159 --> 01:03:28.960
Have a nice day. then.

687
01:03:32.079 --> 01:03:33.519
Take care.

688
01:03:33.599 --> 01:03:37.159
I'm so glad I got to
start my day with you.

689
01:03:38.159 --> 01:03:39.079
Yeah.

690
01:03:41.679 --> 01:03:43.639
So.alhamdulillah.

691
01:03:44.119 --> 01:03:46.840
