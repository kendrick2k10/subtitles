00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:03.052
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho!

4
00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:09.667
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

5
00:03:09.711 --> 00:03:15.673
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

6
00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:21.766
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

7
00:03:25.596 --> 00:03:27.119
We'’re here
to make a withdrawal.

8
00:03:27.163 --> 00:03:31.080
Ho. ho.
fucking ho.

9
00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:33.082
Santa wants
to know who'’s in charge

10
00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:36.085
of these outrageous
overdraft fees.

11
00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:38.435
Put the money in the bag.

12
00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:43.571
My friends. this bank is
an institution of corruption.

13
00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:45.312
What a good little girl.

14
00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:47.314
Santa won'’t forget you.

15
00:03:47.357 --> 00:03:49.620
This is what you worship.
your money.

16
00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:52.275
This place only cares
about your money!

17
00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.450
You wanna hurt them?

18
00:03:53.494 --> 00:03:55.452
This is how you hurt them.

19
00:03:55.496 --> 00:03:57.280
You take what'’s precious
to them.

20
00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.196
Christmas is coming.

21
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.286
So. I wanna say.
"Merry Christmas. sheep."

22
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.375
because you will unwrap
a present

23
00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.682
which is the great liberation!

24
00:04:07.725 --> 00:04:09.945
And it will destroy
this civilization

25
00:04:09.988 --> 00:04:13.818
just like an earthquake
from the Book of Revelations!

26
00:04:13.862 --> 00:04:15.255
Everybody get up!

27
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.735
Move! Up!

28
00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.216
Move! Let'’s go! Move! Come on!

29
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.304
Go! Go! Go!

30
00:04:22.653 --> 00:04:24.002
Hurry the fuck up!

31
00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.006
You remind me
of my mother.

32
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.618
I liked my mother...Go!

33
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:35.623
...but I never forgave her
for bringing me in
to this horrible world.

34
00:04:37.886 --> 00:04:40.584
Because you have been
such good boys and girls.

35
00:04:40.628 --> 00:04:42.673
you can unwrap one gift early.

36
00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:44.893
Merry Christmas.

37
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.394
Ho! Ho! Ho!

38
00:05:14.052 --> 00:05:17.969
Ho! Ho! Ho!

39
00:05:21.016 --> 00:05:23.497
You so-called
men of law enforcement

40
00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:28.719
have imprisoned the people of
this country for far too long.

41
00:05:36.988 --> 00:05:42.211
It'’s time you learn
the true meaning of Christmas.

42
00:05:55.485 --> 00:05:57.095
Kill them all.

43
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.257
Our main priority
is IDing suspects.

44
00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:33.393
We'’ll give the FBI
and the mayor'’s office
our full cooperation.

45
00:06:35.133 --> 00:06:36.178
Understood?

46
00:06:42.271 --> 00:06:44.055
Damn. we got hit today.

47
00:06:46.144 --> 00:06:47.450
And we lost.

48
00:06:49.234 --> 00:06:50.714
But as long as we are standing

49
00:06:50.758 --> 00:06:52.803
and-- and we remember
what we'’re standing for.

50
00:06:52.847 --> 00:06:54.544
we will always win.

51
00:06:58.374 --> 00:07:01.682
They come at you with a knife.
you come at them with a gun.

52
00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:03.901
They come at you with a gun.
I will--

53
00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:06.034
Swear to God I will get you
a fucking tank.

54
00:07:08.645 --> 00:07:11.256
I wanna see whoever did
this shit stand trial.

55
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.172
Are we clear?

56
00:07:18.046 --> 00:07:19.526
Let'’s get to work.

57
00:07:30.493 --> 00:07:33.017
James Edward Knight.

58
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.715
Ex-cop.

59
00:07:35.977 --> 00:07:37.021
Ex-husband.

60
00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:38.632
Ex-military.

61
00:07:38.675 --> 00:07:41.548
That'’s a lot of exes.
Mr. Knight.

62
00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:42.984
Can appreciate that.

63
00:07:44.594 --> 00:07:46.640
Mail.Tour in Afghanistan

64
00:07:46.683 --> 00:07:49.338
followed by stints as a cop
in both Newark and Los Angeles.

65
00:07:49.381 --> 00:07:52.428
As many arrests
as you had citations.

66
00:07:53.864 --> 00:07:57.302
Mr. Knight. you are a guest
in my fine establishment.

67
00:07:57.346 --> 00:07:58.434
awaiting trial.

68
00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:03.439
There will be no
special privileges.

69
00:08:04.222 --> 00:08:05.789
You will be alone at night.

70
00:08:05.833 --> 00:08:09.097
but during the day you will be
with general population.

71
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.707
There'’ll be no bullshit.

72
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:12.492
There'’ll be no gambling.

73
00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:13.884
There will be no fighting.

74
00:08:15.103 --> 00:08:19.107
I expect you to see
the preacher once a day.

75
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.457
We are all God'’s children.
Mr. Knight.

76
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:25.592
but this is my house.

77
00:08:27.332 --> 00:08:28.377
Welcome home.

78
00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:31.511
Think you'’re gonna fit right in.

79
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:35.993
Mail.

80
00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:56.100
District Attorney.

81
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.146
"Casey Rhodes. on behalf

82
00:08:58.189 --> 00:08:59.800
of the public defenders office
we hereby

83
00:08:59.843 --> 00:09:01.889
ask that you consider
the plea agreement set forth..."

84
00:09:05.457 --> 00:09:07.285
"Twenty-five years
incarceration."

85
00:09:54.071 --> 00:09:57.640
The Almighty
has blessed us with Jaden.

86
00:09:57.684 --> 00:10:00.512
But now he has to go and walk
in the light.

87
00:10:00.556 --> 00:10:02.732
And we offer
our congratulations.

88
00:10:04.429 --> 00:10:06.083
Stand up. Jaden.
Come on. Get up.

89
00:10:06.867 --> 00:10:08.129
Thanks. guys.

90
00:10:10.087 --> 00:10:11.654
Hey.

91
00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:13.917
you became a man in here. okay?

92
00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:30.542
Fuck.

93
00:10:45.427 --> 00:10:46.820
Hello. this is Casey Rhodes

94
00:10:46.863 --> 00:10:49.083
from the department
of absentee fathers.

95
00:10:51.172 --> 00:10:53.478
No. no. no. babe. I'’m so--

96
00:10:53.522 --> 00:10:56.394
I'’m sorry. I was trying
to be funny.

97
00:10:58.396 --> 00:11:00.007
No wait.
Hey. come on. Gimme a sec.

98
00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:02.052
Can-- Just put--

99
00:11:02.096 --> 00:11:03.880
Do me a-- Just put Clara on
for a second. Put--

100
00:11:03.924 --> 00:11:05.752
Babe. put Clara
on the fucking phone.

101
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.364
Put--

102
00:11:09.407 --> 00:11:11.322
Darling. I get one--
two minutes here.

103
00:11:11.366 --> 00:11:12.410
Come on.

104
00:11:28.818 --> 00:11:31.038
All right. finally.

105
00:11:39.437 --> 00:11:40.482
All right.

106
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:42.702
Here we go.

107
00:11:45.008 --> 00:11:48.490
All right. Start here.
nighty-night.

108
00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:51.885
Mmm. okay.

109
00:11:51.928 --> 00:11:53.713
Detective. your bet.

110
00:11:57.107 --> 00:11:59.501
All right. I'’ll see you.
I raise you one.

111
00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:03.244
The flippity floppity.

112
00:12:04.114 --> 00:12:07.204
Geez. the Holy Ghost.

113
00:12:07.248 --> 00:12:08.989
How'’s it going. Father?

114
00:12:09.032 --> 00:12:11.513
Well said. Good. good.
Can I join you guys?

115
00:12:12.122 --> 00:12:13.167
Fuck off.

116
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.350
You all talk tough.

117
00:12:23.394 --> 00:12:25.048
You wanna know what tough is?

118
00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:27.268
Change.

119
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.141
Because change takes sacrifice.

120
00:12:33.143 --> 00:12:34.579
Yeah.

121
00:12:34.623 --> 00:12:36.494
You have to be free
in here first

122
00:12:36.538 --> 00:12:37.931
before you can be free
out there.

123
00:12:38.932 --> 00:12:40.934
Yeah. says the guy
peddling religion.

124
00:12:40.977 --> 00:12:43.153
I may be
a religious man.

125
00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:44.851
but I'’m not selling religion.

126
00:12:46.026 --> 00:12:47.244
I'’m selling freedom.

127
00:12:52.249 --> 00:12:53.381
Brother Rhodes.

128
00:12:54.861 --> 00:12:56.079
what are you willing to do

129
00:12:56.123 --> 00:12:57.994
to see your family
and be free again?

130
00:13:03.347 --> 00:13:04.479
Anything.

131
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.222
I'’d do anything.

132
00:13:27.023 --> 00:13:29.634
You'’re a fucking drug addict.
Casey.

133
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:42.909
Daddy!

134
00:13:56.487 --> 00:13:58.489
You'’re in hell right now.
brother.

135
00:14:03.016 --> 00:14:04.321
I'’ve been right where you are.

136
00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.325
They tossed me in jail
and threw away the key.

137
00:14:12.199 --> 00:14:13.287
All that pain.

138
00:14:15.942 --> 00:14:17.378
All that rage.

139
00:14:19.728 --> 00:14:21.251
Don'’t you waste it.

140
00:14:24.646 --> 00:14:26.430
Let it purify you. brother.

141
00:14:28.998 --> 00:14:30.957
Let it become your guiding star.

142
00:14:33.176 --> 00:14:35.135
Think about your family.

143
00:14:35.178 --> 00:14:37.398
Think about all the good
you can do for them.

144
00:14:38.703 --> 00:14:43.360
And I promise you'’ll
rise again like a phoenix.

145
00:14:44.448 --> 00:14:46.146
Greater than you'’ve ever been.

146
00:14:47.712 --> 00:14:50.541
I believe in you. Casey Rhodes.

147
00:15:07.471 --> 00:15:09.125
Do you believe in yourself?

148
00:15:54.692 --> 00:15:56.303
A group
calling themselves

149
00:15:56.346 --> 00:15:59.219
the real saints of Christmas
have claimed responsibility

150
00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:01.917
for the spate of bombings
across New York City.

151
00:16:11.535 --> 00:16:14.974
Ho! Ho! Ho!

152
00:16:25.636 --> 00:16:28.074
This is a liberation.

153
00:16:29.336 --> 00:16:30.815
Get on the ground!

154
00:16:30.859 --> 00:16:34.036
Get on the ground and pray
to your favorite god.

155
00:16:35.168 --> 00:16:37.735
You'’re gonna all be famous.

156
00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:39.868
This is my present to you.

157
00:16:39.911 --> 00:16:41.957
Merry fucking Christmas.

158
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:46.614
The great liberation is at hand.
and you are a part of it.

159
00:16:46.657 --> 00:16:48.094
We'’re going--

160
00:16:51.793 --> 00:16:53.751
Get them up.
Get them in the vault.

161
00:16:53.795 --> 00:16:56.711
Someone blast a hole
in those security cameras.

162
00:17:00.715 --> 00:17:01.759
Get them in there.

163
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:10.159
But I'’m not selling religion.

164
00:17:10.203 --> 00:17:11.813
I'’m selling freedom.

165
00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:17.949
Stand up. Jaden.
Come on. Get up.

166
00:17:18.733 --> 00:17:20.039
Thanks. guys.

167
00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.826
Brother. med. please.

168
00:17:26.654 --> 00:17:28.264
My vision is clear...

169
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.747
Get in there.
Move! Move!

170
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.096
Get into the vault.

171
00:17:37.317 --> 00:17:40.450
...because of your heroism
and your loyalty. brother.

172
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:45.151
But I'’ve got no room
for dead weight.

173
00:17:45.194 --> 00:17:48.328
What-- What happened
to no man left behind?

174
00:17:50.547 --> 00:17:52.506
They left us all behind.

175
00:18:29.325 --> 00:18:30.805
I need more men.

176
00:18:41.163 --> 00:18:43.296
Dr. Kravitz.

177
00:18:43.339 --> 00:18:45.385
you have a visitor
in the main hall.

178
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:58.746
What.
you in the Christmas spirit?

179
00:18:58.789 --> 00:19:01.618
You'’re gonna drop the charges
on my partner?

180
00:19:01.662 --> 00:19:03.185
'’Tis the season.

181
00:19:03.229 --> 00:19:05.448
He did the right thing. Cap.

182
00:19:05.492 --> 00:19:07.929
Look.
I try and write him letters.

183
00:19:07.972 --> 00:19:10.236
I try and call him.
He won'’t speak to me.

184
00:19:10.279 --> 00:19:12.020
He won'’t let me tell him that--

185
00:19:14.109 --> 00:19:17.852
He did what every partner
should do and had my back.

186
00:19:17.895 --> 00:19:19.723
He ignored due process.

187
00:19:20.811 --> 00:19:22.770
He desecrated
the oath he took.

188
00:19:22.813 --> 00:19:25.164
Yeah. Knight would call that
a good day'’s work.

189
00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:29.994
You following
the Christmas bomber?

190
00:19:30.038 --> 00:19:33.259
What. you'’re gonna pin
all that shit on him too?

191
00:19:33.302 --> 00:19:34.825
I'’m out of cards to play.

192
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.785
FBI. CIA...

193
00:19:39.395 --> 00:19:40.875
...nobody has any leads.

194
00:19:40.918 --> 00:19:43.356
We ran a gait analysis.

195
00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:46.010
ran every shell fired
through IBIS.

196
00:19:46.054 --> 00:19:48.274
Nothing.
This guy'’s a ghost.

197
00:19:48.317 --> 00:19:51.233
But Knight has done more
with less.

198
00:19:51.277 --> 00:19:52.974
You and I both know

199
00:19:53.017 --> 00:19:54.584
Knight would say yes
to joining the hunt. No. no. no.

200
00:19:54.628 --> 00:19:56.891
Knight has dedicated his life
to this job.

201
00:19:56.934 --> 00:20:00.721
He lost his wife.
his relationship with his kid.

202
00:20:00.764 --> 00:20:02.113
and his freedom.

203
00:20:02.157 --> 00:20:04.159
And if he catches the bomber.

204
00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.509
maybe he gets
one of those three back.

205
00:20:06.553 --> 00:20:10.948
Don'’t turn him into a monster
just to catch a monster.

206
00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:14.822
I got a city too scared
to leave their houses.

207
00:20:16.127 --> 00:20:18.217
I got a madman blowing up banks
on Christmas.

208
00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.001
And I got a mayor that--

209
00:20:20.044 --> 00:20:21.742
Never mind.

210
00:20:21.785 --> 00:20:23.874
No. no. no.
Finish that sentence.

211
00:20:23.918 --> 00:20:25.876
What-- What about the mayor?

212
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.487
Forget what I said
about the mayor.

213
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.229
And don'’t you even think
about coming to New York.

214
00:20:51.989 --> 00:20:54.644
Padre...
...what brings you down here?

215
00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:57.778
Hi. Warden.
How'’s your night going?Terrible.

216
00:20:57.821 --> 00:21:00.302
Seems like it'’s a damn sight
better than yours?

217
00:21:00.346 --> 00:21:04.175
You'’re very intuitive.
Yeah.

218
00:21:04.219 --> 00:21:06.177
I don'’t know
what I'’m doing out here
this time of night.

219
00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:07.701
I know it'’s a mistake.

220
00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:11.922
I had a dream.

221
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.534
Yeah. about the guys.

222
00:21:14.577 --> 00:21:16.840
About some of the men
in prison. I was--

223
00:21:16.884 --> 00:21:19.408
I just wanna check on them.
make sure they'’re okay.

224
00:21:19.452 --> 00:21:22.890
You had a dream?
Like a-- Like a premonition?

225
00:21:22.933 --> 00:21:25.893
Like a-- Like a vision.

226
00:21:25.936 --> 00:21:29.331
So. what prisoner
are we dreaming about?

227
00:21:30.811 --> 00:21:31.942
All of '’em.

228
00:21:32.987 --> 00:21:35.119
All of them?Yeah.

229
00:21:35.163 --> 00:21:37.470
Yeah.
I know this was a mistake. I--

230
00:21:37.513 --> 00:21:40.211
If they see me out here.
they'’re gonna think
something'’s amiss.

231
00:21:40.255 --> 00:21:42.431
That'’s gonna create
all kinds of drama.
I didn'’t want that.

232
00:21:42.475 --> 00:21:44.564
I think you'’re right there.
I think you'’re right.

233
00:21:44.607 --> 00:21:47.306
Yeah. No.Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

234
00:21:48.219 --> 00:21:49.656
The security center.

235
00:21:49.699 --> 00:21:51.527
I could look
through the monitors.

236
00:21:51.571 --> 00:21:53.660
They wouldn'’t see me.
It would set my mind at ease.

237
00:21:53.703 --> 00:21:55.139
I would feel so much better.

238
00:21:55.183 --> 00:21:56.227
No.

239
00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.319
Yeah. yeah. You'’re right.

240
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.019
Padre.

241
00:22:05.062 --> 00:22:07.326
Yeah?Come on. It'’s Christmas.

242
00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:10.198
Let'’s take a look. shall we?

243
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:11.939
Okay.

244
00:22:11.982 --> 00:22:14.376
Yeah.
Let'’s take a look.

245
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.683
You'’re a good man.I know.

246
00:22:25.996 --> 00:22:28.477
All present
and accounted for.

247
00:22:28.521 --> 00:22:30.392
Of course they are.

248
00:22:30.436 --> 00:22:35.179
I run a tighter ship
than Lord Nelson ever did.

249
00:22:35.223 --> 00:22:38.705
Now. Father Conlan.
what was your vision?

250
00:22:39.662 --> 00:22:41.447
Oh.

251
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.319
I envisioned your death.

252
00:22:59.769 --> 00:23:01.684
Can I have your attention.
my brothers?

253
00:23:02.729 --> 00:23:04.861
I bring you
great Christmas tidings.

254
00:23:15.742 --> 00:23:19.746
Today is
the beginning of the liberation.

255
00:23:21.835 --> 00:23:23.271
So prepare yourselves.

256
00:23:25.142 --> 00:23:27.318
Hmm.

257
00:23:31.148 --> 00:23:32.280
Let it begin.

258
00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:30.860
Where are you.
Brother Rhodes?

259
00:24:35.822 --> 00:24:37.171
Hey. man.

260
00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:40.391
You all right?

261
00:24:40.435 --> 00:24:42.959
Yeah. yeah.
Yeah.

262
00:25:01.848 --> 00:25:04.415
And unto you.
this day was born a savior.

263
00:25:06.026 --> 00:25:08.855
And the wages of sin is death.

264
00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:11.901
And freedom is a gift.

265
00:25:11.945 --> 00:25:14.295
You have incarcerated
your brothers

266
00:25:14.338 --> 00:25:18.255
which is not abided by--
by any other species.

267
00:25:19.605 --> 00:25:21.476
So today.

268
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.479
I give the gift of freedom
to my brothers.

269
00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:26.916
Because freedom is
their birthright.

270
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.876
Freedom is what we will take.

271
00:25:30.964 --> 00:25:33.532
Merry Christmas. motherfuckers!

272
00:25:33.575 --> 00:25:36.186
Ho! Ho! Ho!

273
00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:55.771
Five guards are confirmed dead

274
00:25:55.815 --> 00:26:00.341
and 42 convicts escaped
from New York'’s Rikers
maximum security prison tonight.

275
00:26:00.384 --> 00:26:03.605
The police have released
a description of
one of the suspects.

276
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:07.827
Ricky Conlan. a former marine
turned prison chaplain.

277
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.090
who is also now being
sought for questioning

278
00:26:10.133 --> 00:26:12.875
regarding the Christmas
bombing attacks
on the city'’s banks.

279
00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:15.443
US marshals
have been dispatched...

280
00:26:15.486 --> 00:26:16.705
You can leave.

281
00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:28.369
I thought you'’d split
with the rest of '’em.

282
00:26:28.412 --> 00:26:32.503
A good bed is. uh--
is hard to find.

283
00:26:32.547 --> 00:26:35.289
I need your read on a suspect.

284
00:26:35.332 --> 00:26:39.685
Tell me what every cop
and profiler from Quantico
to Camp Perry isn'’t seeing.

285
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.211
His real name is
Richard Ricky Conlan.

286
00:26:44.254 --> 00:26:46.517
Conlan was Special Ops.

287
00:26:47.127 --> 00:26:48.607
Then he went rogue.

288
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.348
He fought with his CO.
got court-martialed.

289
00:26:51.392 --> 00:26:53.437
sentenced to seven years
in supermax.

290
00:26:53.481 --> 00:26:56.658
While inside.
Conlan'’s son was killed
in action

291
00:26:56.702 --> 00:26:59.095
and he was refused permission
to attend the funeral.

292
00:26:59.139 --> 00:27:02.185
Somewhere in there.
he discovered
his spiritual side.

293
00:27:02.229 --> 00:27:04.100
Got out ten years ago.

294
00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:07.408
Ever since.
Conlan'’s been working
as a prison counselor.

295
00:27:07.451 --> 00:27:10.150
Everyone we speak to says
he'’s a pillar of the community.

296
00:27:10.193 --> 00:27:12.848
Best thing since Mr. Rogers.

297
00:27:12.892 --> 00:27:17.461
Now that he'’s been ID'ed.
FBI link him for 21 homicides.

298
00:27:17.505 --> 00:27:19.246
eight armed bank robberies.

299
00:27:20.421 --> 00:27:22.205
Never showed his face
before last night.

300
00:27:22.249 --> 00:27:24.991
when he busted out your bestie.
Casey Rhodes.

301
00:27:25.034 --> 00:27:27.036
and other hard-core degenerates.

302
00:27:29.343 --> 00:27:30.649
Why didn'’t you break out?

303
00:27:35.784 --> 00:27:38.526
I'’m wasting my time here.

304
00:27:38.569 --> 00:27:42.486
Whenever I had a tough case.
I remind myself one thing.

305
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.098
What?

306
00:27:45.141 --> 00:27:48.579
Everyone bleeds.You can'’t be saying
shit like that.

307
00:27:48.623 --> 00:27:52.627
You are about to stand trial
for the murder of two suspects.

308
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:54.020
I killed more than two.

309
00:27:54.063 --> 00:27:56.544
Okay. that is not something
to be proud of.

310
00:27:56.587 --> 00:27:58.502
I killed some bad guys.

311
00:28:01.767 --> 00:28:03.159
It was a good day.

312
00:28:03.203 --> 00:28:05.031
Everyone has a right
to due process.

313
00:28:05.074 --> 00:28:08.730
You swore an oath
to serve and protect.

314
00:28:08.774 --> 00:28:09.992
I own what I did.

315
00:28:11.298 --> 00:28:14.301
You'’re a disgrace.
You'’re a vigilante.

316
00:28:14.344 --> 00:28:16.042
Why didn'’t you break out?

317
00:28:21.787 --> 00:28:22.831
I'’m a cop.

318
00:28:23.963 --> 00:28:25.747
It'’s how I'm wired.

319
00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:27.314
I believe in the rule
of the law.

320
00:28:27.357 --> 00:28:29.751
You are not a cop.

321
00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:32.885
You are a criminal
who had a badge

322
00:28:32.928 --> 00:28:35.757
and thought it gave him
the right to do
whatever the hell he wanted.

323
00:28:38.629 --> 00:28:39.718
I need your help.

324
00:28:42.329 --> 00:28:45.724
I need you to pretend
to be a cop one more time.

325
00:28:47.943 --> 00:28:48.988
I don'’t like you.

326
00:28:50.424 --> 00:28:52.731
I don'’t respect you.

327
00:28:52.774 --> 00:28:54.863
But you can do things
I cannot do.

328
00:28:56.691 --> 00:28:57.953
In another life.

329
00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:00.347
Conlan is you.

330
00:29:02.001 --> 00:29:04.699
The drive.
the self-righteousness.

331
00:29:08.007 --> 00:29:09.660
Stop Ricky Conlan

332
00:29:09.704 --> 00:29:12.663
and the DA will drop
all charges against you.

333
00:29:13.708 --> 00:29:15.884
Why me?

334
00:29:15.928 --> 00:29:18.539
'’Cause you could have broke out
with the rest of the guys
in your cell block

335
00:29:18.582 --> 00:29:20.019
and you chose not to.

336
00:29:21.672 --> 00:29:23.022
You chose to do the right thing.

337
00:29:24.893 --> 00:29:27.896
You'’re no better
than the guys you killed
or locked up.

338
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.159
but there'’s still good in you.

339
00:29:30.203 --> 00:29:32.466
And because you'’re
the only guy I know

340
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:34.250
who might be crazier
than Ricky is.

341
00:29:35.077 --> 00:29:36.600
I am flattered.

342
00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:38.820
But understand this.

343
00:29:38.864 --> 00:29:43.129
He'’s not robbing banks.
He'’s putting on a show.

344
00:29:43.172 --> 00:29:44.217
How do you know that?

345
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.045
Think like a criminal.

346
00:29:46.828 --> 00:29:48.438
It tracks.

347
00:29:48.482 --> 00:29:49.744
Any leads?

348
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.965
Wanna hear a bad joke?

349
00:29:53.008 --> 00:29:54.618
Always.

350
00:29:56.316 --> 00:29:58.622
When the last bank was hit
in Midtown.

351
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.626
someone had an appointment
with the manager

352
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:04.803
at the same time
and didn'’t show.

353
00:30:04.846 --> 00:30:07.153
Guess who it was.The pope?

354
00:30:07.196 --> 00:30:08.937
Close.

355
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:10.939
Vassetti.The mayor.

356
00:30:10.983 --> 00:30:12.680
One and only.

357
00:30:12.723 --> 00:30:14.508
Someone tipped him off.

358
00:30:16.118 --> 00:30:17.163
Yeah.

359
00:30:41.665 --> 00:30:44.364
Tell me I'’m not
making the worst decision
of my life.

360
00:30:45.887 --> 00:30:47.933
I wanna catch this guy.

361
00:30:47.976 --> 00:30:52.024
Give me my gun.
and I'’ll do the rest.

362
00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:55.941
Conlan comes to me alive.
Got it?

363
00:30:55.984 --> 00:30:58.857
James Knight
versus a psychotic bank robber.

364
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:03.122
Let'’s hope
the city'’s still standing
come Christmas morning.

365
00:31:14.307 --> 00:31:15.917
He seems
like a lot of fun.

366
00:31:15.961 --> 00:31:17.745
He'’s probably a Jets fan.

367
00:31:20.008 --> 00:31:22.793
Look. I'’m not really
into this cult shit.
Let'’s get the fuck out of here.

368
00:31:24.317 --> 00:31:26.449
How are the libations.
my brothers?

369
00:31:26.493 --> 00:31:27.842
Let'’s go.

370
00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:29.322
Hear what he has to say
and leave?

371
00:31:29.365 --> 00:31:32.281
When that man speaks.
you listen.

372
00:31:35.154 --> 00:31:39.375
Dajon barks like a dog.
but he'’s a loyal one.

373
00:31:47.166 --> 00:31:48.210
My brothers...

374
00:31:51.387 --> 00:31:54.086
the time is upon us
for the great liberation.

375
00:31:54.129 --> 00:31:58.394
But I ask you one small favor.

376
00:31:58.438 --> 00:32:00.179
I ask you to trust.

377
00:32:01.397 --> 00:32:04.400
Trust that together
we can change the world.

378
00:32:04.444 --> 00:32:07.360
Trust that when we move as one.

379
00:32:07.403 --> 00:32:13.583
that those sheep out there
will tremble in fear
at the sight of us.

380
00:32:15.324 --> 00:32:19.938
There are more people
in prison in this country

381
00:32:19.981 --> 00:32:22.418
than any other nation
on the planet.

382
00:32:22.462 --> 00:32:28.337
74% of souls in cages
haven'’t even been convicted

383
00:32:28.381 --> 00:32:30.252
of a crime.

384
00:32:30.296 --> 00:32:34.735
They'’re in there
because they can'’t afford
to pay bail.

385
00:32:34.778 --> 00:32:39.435
They can'’t even
pay their mortgage. their rent.

386
00:32:39.479 --> 00:32:43.178
while their brothers
in their mansions laugh at them.

387
00:32:45.093 --> 00:32:47.008
We'’re persecuting the poor.

388
00:32:47.052 --> 00:32:48.836
It makes my blood boil.

389
00:32:51.665 --> 00:32:53.623
And I was a soldier
for this country.

390
00:32:55.451 --> 00:32:58.585
I spilled blood in countries
you can'’t even find on a map.

391
00:33:01.762 --> 00:33:05.853
They asked me to execute people
who did not deserve to die.

392
00:33:05.896 --> 00:33:09.944
And when I stood against them.
they threw me in a cage too.

393
00:33:10.945 --> 00:33:12.164
Yes. they did.

394
00:33:14.079 --> 00:33:16.429
And then when my son died
in combat...

395
00:33:24.524 --> 00:33:27.701
...I couldn'’t even see
my own son'’s body
be lowered into the ground.

396
00:33:29.746 --> 00:33:31.444
Tell me that'’s not cruel.

397
00:33:32.967 --> 00:33:34.621
Tell me that'’s not torture.

398
00:33:37.667 --> 00:33:43.978
The corruption of this sick
and diseased civilization.

399
00:33:45.675 --> 00:33:47.068
we have to wipe it out.

400
00:33:47.112 --> 00:33:50.593
We have to burn their sick egos
to the ground

401
00:33:50.637 --> 00:33:54.945
and raise this whole country
and start fresh and anew.

402
00:33:58.514 --> 00:34:00.473
Look at this holiday.

403
00:34:00.516 --> 00:34:02.953
Christmas.

404
00:34:02.997 --> 00:34:04.694
They'’ve perverted
this holiday.

405
00:34:04.738 --> 00:34:08.524
They'’ve turned it into
a giant mall of consumerism.

406
00:34:08.568 --> 00:34:11.875
We have to take it back.
We have to make it ours.

407
00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:15.401
This blessed day
will no longer be corrupted
by their ugliness.

408
00:34:16.184 --> 00:34:18.491
We will bring that change.

409
00:34:18.534 --> 00:34:21.233
Because this is war.

410
00:34:21.276 --> 00:34:23.061
And there will be no prisoners.

411
00:34:24.714 --> 00:34:26.455
And when they think
of Christmas...

412
00:34:28.544 --> 00:34:30.024
...they will think of us.

413
00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:37.945
But those of you
who do not want to be here
for this great liberation...

414
00:34:40.339 --> 00:34:41.514
...there'’s the door.

415
00:34:51.132 --> 00:34:54.962
No offense. no disrespect.
but. uh. yeah. fellas. I'’m out.
Feliz Navidad.

416
00:34:55.005 --> 00:34:56.137
Pussy.

417
00:34:56.181 --> 00:34:59.662
No. no. no. No. Dajon.

418
00:34:59.706 --> 00:35:01.882
That man wants to be free.

419
00:35:01.925 --> 00:35:03.927
And our gift to him
is his freedom.

420
00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:08.323
Just make sure he finds
the right way out.

421
00:35:15.417 --> 00:35:17.376
Celebrate tonight. my brothers.

422
00:35:18.768 --> 00:35:20.509
Tomorrow. we begin.

423
00:35:25.645 --> 00:35:26.907
Brother Rhodes.

424
00:35:28.082 --> 00:35:29.127
You'’re not drinking.

425
00:35:30.302 --> 00:35:32.173
No. No. I'’m. uh--

426
00:35:32.217 --> 00:35:34.306
You know. I'’m not thirsty. so...

427
00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:36.221
Don'’t lie to me.

428
00:35:38.353 --> 00:35:41.574
Don'’t lie to me
and don'’t ever cover for anyone.

429
00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:48.842
Uh. Father. uh...

430
00:35:48.885 --> 00:35:51.149
A favor to ask you.No.

431
00:35:52.324 --> 00:35:54.064
Don'’t even know
what I'’m gonna ask you.

432
00:35:54.108 --> 00:35:56.458
You wanna call your family
and tell them you'’re okay.

433
00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.113
No.

434
00:36:00.723 --> 00:36:03.770
What if I make a trade with you?

435
00:36:09.558 --> 00:36:12.996
You'’ve realized you're more
than your addiction.

436
00:36:14.128 --> 00:36:15.260
Very good.

437
00:36:17.392 --> 00:36:18.872
Make it quick.

438
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.230
Nice speech.

439
00:36:30.927 --> 00:36:34.322
You'’ll have a nice day
on the swings.
It'’s gonna be so fun.

440
00:36:34.366 --> 00:36:35.410
Yeah.

441
00:36:36.019 --> 00:36:37.499
God.

442
00:36:37.543 --> 00:36:39.240
Look.
stop following us. okay?

443
00:36:39.284 --> 00:36:41.024
I don'’t know where Casey is.

444
00:36:42.765 --> 00:36:44.463
Ugh. I'’m sorry. honey.

445
00:36:44.506 --> 00:36:45.768
It'’s okay.

446
00:36:45.812 --> 00:36:47.988
Are you okay?

447
00:36:48.031 --> 00:36:49.685
Yeah.Yeah?

448
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.647
Well. I had a nightmare.

449
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.084
Yeah?

450
00:36:57.127 --> 00:36:59.913
Daddy never came home
because he was drowning.

451
00:36:59.956 --> 00:37:03.090
I tried to save him.
but I couldn'’t.

452
00:37:04.874 --> 00:37:07.050
I'’m sorry. sweetheart.

453
00:37:07.094 --> 00:37:09.183
Can I call him?

454
00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:10.663
Not today.

455
00:37:10.706 --> 00:37:12.404
There'’s gonna be no crying
in this household

456
00:37:12.447 --> 00:37:13.709
over Daddy. okay?

457
00:37:13.753 --> 00:37:15.233
Okay.Okay?

458
00:37:15.276 --> 00:37:17.322
Mommy is getting a phone call.
But go-- go play.

459
00:37:17.365 --> 00:37:18.410
Okay.

460
00:37:23.937 --> 00:37:27.549
Hello?Hello. this is from the
department of absentee fathers.

461
00:37:27.593 --> 00:37:28.942
Calling again.

462
00:37:28.985 --> 00:37:30.422
Hi. Mom.

463
00:37:31.205 --> 00:37:33.120
What the fuck are you doing?

464
00:37:33.163 --> 00:37:34.817
How are you holding up?

465
00:37:35.905 --> 00:37:36.950
Not great.

466
00:37:38.604 --> 00:37:39.648
How is she doing?

467
00:37:39.692 --> 00:37:42.912
She'’s confused.

468
00:37:42.956 --> 00:37:45.306
More questions every day.
wondering where her dad is.

469
00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:48.657
and why I don'’t let her
watch the TV.

470
00:37:49.702 --> 00:37:52.313
Look. please don'’t tell me
that you'’re--

471
00:37:52.357 --> 00:37:53.923
you'’re part of the jailbreak.

472
00:37:55.577 --> 00:37:59.189
I. uh. kind of got mixed up
in it. darling.

473
00:37:59.233 --> 00:38:01.757
I don'’t know how it happened.
but...

474
00:38:03.542 --> 00:38:06.109
...I couldn'’t spend
another day in that cell.

475
00:38:06.153 --> 00:38:08.111
How could you be so stupid?

476
00:38:08.155 --> 00:38:10.418
Pretty much used up
all the stupid
getting this far. huh?

477
00:38:10.462 --> 00:38:15.945
They say the guy
who orchestrated the jailbreak
is-- is the Christmas bomber.

478
00:38:15.989 --> 00:38:19.427
Honestly. I'’d rather you be
inside and alive than--

479
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:20.602
Instead of what?

480
00:38:21.908 --> 00:38:24.432
Dead?
Inside is pretty much
the same exact thing.

481
00:38:24.476 --> 00:38:26.956
Ugh. God.

482
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.002
I just feel like you don'’t--
you don'’t think.

483
00:38:29.045 --> 00:38:31.047
You don'’t think at all.
You don'’t fucking think.

484
00:38:31.091 --> 00:38:33.180
No. I can fix this. darling. No. you can'’t.

485
00:38:33.223 --> 00:38:35.791
You can'’t fucking fix this.

486
00:38:35.835 --> 00:38:41.188
You sound like an addict. I'’m with Conlan right now. okay?
I can maybe cut a deal.

487
00:38:41.231 --> 00:38:44.017
I need you to call the police.
tell them what
I just told you. okay?

488
00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:48.413
I'’m gonna text you
the address right now.

489
00:38:50.893 --> 00:38:52.330
Don'’t give up on me. okay?

490
00:38:54.506 --> 00:38:55.550
I love you.

491
00:38:58.205 --> 00:38:59.424
Prove it.

492
00:39:25.014 --> 00:39:26.451
Casey Rhodes.

493
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.281
We had such high hopes for you.

494
00:39:38.463 --> 00:39:39.464
What?

495
00:39:40.552 --> 00:39:41.553
Put her through.

496
00:39:42.945 --> 00:39:46.427
Mrs. Rhodes.
what can I do for you?

497
00:39:46.471 --> 00:39:49.343
Casey called me.
He'’s with the bomber.

498
00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:50.866
When did you talk to him?

499
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.173
Just now.Did he give you an address?

500
00:39:53.216 --> 00:39:56.568
Look. I need your word
that all the charges
against Casey will be dropped.

501
00:39:56.611 --> 00:39:59.092
Full immunity.I can say with confidence

502
00:39:59.135 --> 00:40:03.139
that the mayor
and the DA'’s office
would be willing to cut a deal.

503
00:40:03.183 --> 00:40:05.838
Send me something in writing.
and I'’ll send you the address.

504
00:40:53.189 --> 00:40:55.322
Oh. God.

505
00:40:59.021 --> 00:41:01.763
Hold it!
Hold it right there!

506
00:41:13.862 --> 00:41:15.603
This was his B team.

507
00:41:15.647 --> 00:41:17.953
Conlan left 20 minutes
before we showed up.

508
00:41:17.997 --> 00:41:19.607
He might have been tipped off.

509
00:41:19.651 --> 00:41:21.653
I put my ass
on the line for you.

510
00:41:21.696 --> 00:41:23.524
I got you out to get results.

511
00:41:23.568 --> 00:41:27.397
His team prepped here.
They paid cash.

512
00:41:27.441 --> 00:41:31.227
The landlord has no idea. None.

513
00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:33.229
They don'’t know where he is.

514
00:41:33.273 --> 00:41:35.797
Conlan is always one step ahead.

515
00:41:35.841 --> 00:41:37.495
Do the Feds have anything?

516
00:41:37.538 --> 00:41:39.409
They know less than we do.

517
00:41:39.453 --> 00:41:42.021
There'’s only one witness
that we haven'’t questioned.

518
00:41:45.154 --> 00:41:46.808
We cannot get
the mayor involved.

519
00:41:46.852 --> 00:41:49.071
You said to do
whatever it takes.

520
00:41:49.985 --> 00:41:51.509
This is what it takes.

521
00:41:56.165 --> 00:41:59.473
All right. I'’ll--
I'’ll meet with him. okay?

522
00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:01.127
You'’re a good one. Captain.

523
00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:03.825
Don'’t I know it.

524
00:42:37.642 --> 00:42:39.731
Hey. my son plays the cello.

525
00:42:39.774 --> 00:42:43.256
Yeah. you'’re pretty good at it.

526
00:42:43.299 --> 00:42:45.867
No. no. don'’t--
don'’t stop. please.

527
00:42:45.911 --> 00:42:48.435
You try playing for four hours.

528
00:42:48.478 --> 00:42:50.916
Uh. that'’ll be a hard pass.

529
00:42:50.959 --> 00:42:52.570
Exactly.

530
00:42:53.658 --> 00:42:54.746
You a cop?

531
00:42:56.443 --> 00:42:57.879
Why?

532
00:42:58.488 --> 00:42:59.925
Fuck the police.

533
00:43:05.234 --> 00:43:06.496
Charming.

534
00:43:39.921 --> 00:43:43.533
Arthur.
we need to discuss
where you were last night.

535
00:43:43.577 --> 00:43:45.971
We'’re gonna have
to have a conversation.

536
00:43:54.936 --> 00:43:57.504
Welcome to my home. sir.

537
00:44:00.115 --> 00:44:01.900
Anyone thinking of donating
to the city.

538
00:44:01.943 --> 00:44:03.728
well. is a friend of mine.

539
00:44:04.729 --> 00:44:05.947
Ah. yeah.

540
00:44:05.991 --> 00:44:08.341
Yeah. that was just a lie

541
00:44:08.384 --> 00:44:12.084
so I was able to get
an appointment with you
on shorter notice.

542
00:44:12.127 --> 00:44:14.042
I'’m not even a constituent.

543
00:44:14.086 --> 00:44:16.044
And I definitely wouldn'’t
vote for you.

544
00:44:16.088 --> 00:44:20.832
But I do have this.

545
00:44:22.529 --> 00:44:23.748
Los Angeles.

546
00:44:23.791 --> 00:44:25.750
You'’re out of your jurisdiction.

547
00:44:25.793 --> 00:44:27.229
And you'’re wasting my time.

548
00:44:27.273 --> 00:44:29.536
And you'’re letting
a madman blow up banks.

549
00:44:29.579 --> 00:44:31.973
So I guess you and I
have a lot to talk about.

550
00:44:34.802 --> 00:44:37.718
Man. I wish I had a seat
at your weekly poker game.

551
00:44:37.762 --> 00:44:40.416
because you lie for shit.

552
00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.942
Now. why did you miss
your appointment at the bank

553
00:44:43.985 --> 00:44:45.508
the day that it was blowing up?

554
00:44:46.248 --> 00:44:47.554
Midtown traffic.

555
00:44:48.424 --> 00:44:49.991
What was the appointment for?

556
00:44:50.035 --> 00:44:52.646
Hmm? What. you need a loan?

557
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:57.390
I was. uh.
looking to close out
my safety deposit box.

558
00:44:58.783 --> 00:45:01.350
And Ricky Conlan beat you to it.

559
00:45:01.394 --> 00:45:03.265
Hmm.What was in it?

560
00:45:04.397 --> 00:45:06.878
Nothing of importance.Come on.

561
00:45:06.921 --> 00:45:09.010
No blood diamonds?

562
00:45:09.054 --> 00:45:12.405
No photos of you
in a little white robe
with a little pointy hat?

563
00:45:13.754 --> 00:45:14.755
No.

564
00:45:15.887 --> 00:45:18.498
Come on. What does Conlan have
on you. huh?

565
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:20.282
Video of you fucking the maid?

566
00:45:23.198 --> 00:45:24.765
Arthur?

567
00:45:26.593 --> 00:45:27.681
Again. please.

568
00:45:28.856 --> 00:45:30.597
Really sweet kid.

569
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.036
Well. I need to prepare
for my press conference.

570
00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.823
Of course.
You gotta rehearse
all that bullshit.

571
00:45:38.866 --> 00:45:41.216
Thank you
for your service. Officer.

572
00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.741
Actually. that'’s "Detective."

573
00:45:44.916 --> 00:45:46.961
I'’m sorry
I couldn'’t be more help.

574
00:45:47.005 --> 00:45:48.441
Oh. don'’t be sorry.

575
00:45:48.484 --> 00:45:50.356
No. you were
a great deal of help.

576
00:45:51.574 --> 00:45:52.924
After you.

577
00:45:58.451 --> 00:46:01.236
Oh. you know what?

578
00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.848
No. ah.
there'’s just. um--

579
00:46:03.891 --> 00:46:05.719
I just have one more thing.

580
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:09.201
Mm-hmm.Do you still have
safety deposit boxes?

581
00:46:09.244 --> 00:46:10.985
Now. why would you
want to know that?

582
00:46:11.029 --> 00:46:14.206
Ah. just after Conlan'’s heist.
where did you move them to?

583
00:46:14.249 --> 00:46:16.991
I consolidated them
into one location.

584
00:46:17.035 --> 00:46:18.776
And where would that be?

585
00:46:20.168 --> 00:46:21.953
An impenetrable bank.

586
00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:25.217
Few know the actual location.

587
00:46:26.653 --> 00:46:30.570
Consider it a Fort Knox
for the 1%.

588
00:46:30.613 --> 00:46:34.182
Ah. Well. Mr. Mayor.

589
00:46:34.226 --> 00:46:38.012
I think that you and I are
gonna be seeing
a lot of each other.

590
00:46:39.579 --> 00:46:40.885
I look forward to it.

591
00:46:41.711 --> 00:46:42.756
Good.

592
00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:49.241
Oh. and. uh.

593
00:46:49.284 --> 00:46:51.547
what'’s your wrist size.
Mr. Mayor?

594
00:46:51.591 --> 00:46:55.334
I'’d love to send you a nice
little fuzzy pair of handcuffs
for Christmas.

595
00:46:59.991 --> 00:47:02.428
You can keep the itinerary.

596
00:47:02.471 --> 00:47:03.516
Blow me.

597
00:47:29.368 --> 00:47:30.586
What the--

598
00:47:31.805 --> 00:47:33.763
How'’d you get in here?

599
00:47:33.807 --> 00:47:36.114
Well. that'’s between me
and the door.

600
00:47:39.204 --> 00:47:42.207
Get out from behind my desk.
I asked you a ques-- Oh.

601
00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:43.948
You'’re in a wheelchair.

602
00:47:43.991 --> 00:47:46.385
Bullets didn'’t hit my spine.
so if I stay off my feet.

603
00:47:46.428 --> 00:47:48.213
I'’ll be up and running
by Memorial Day.

604
00:47:48.256 --> 00:47:50.780
How the hell did you
get in here?

605
00:47:50.824 --> 00:47:55.394
Yeah. well. you'’re a detective.
You figure it out.

606
00:47:55.437 --> 00:47:58.963
You flew all the way
from LA to New York
to bust into my office?

607
00:47:59.006 --> 00:48:01.835
Oh. and I might as well
tell you now.

608
00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:04.011
because you will find out.

609
00:48:04.055 --> 00:48:06.231
I paid a visit to the mayor.

610
00:48:06.274 --> 00:48:08.102
Man. I can'’t believe...

611
00:48:08.146 --> 00:48:11.323
...he'’s such a bad liar.
He'’s made it so far in politics.

612
00:48:11.366 --> 00:48:13.891
Now he'’s messaging me.

613
00:48:13.934 --> 00:48:17.068
asking me why some LA cop
is asking him questions.

614
00:48:17.111 --> 00:48:18.373
Because he'’s involved.

615
00:48:21.637 --> 00:48:24.858
This could be
the biggest scandal
in the history of the city.

616
00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:27.469
I know Conlan'’s got
something on the mayor.

617
00:48:27.513 --> 00:48:31.212
Let'’s just hope if
Knight finds out what it is.
he'’ll do the right thing.

618
00:48:31.256 --> 00:48:33.911
Yeah. Knight will play
by the book.

619
00:48:33.954 --> 00:48:35.825
I have a feeling his
definition of "by the book"

620
00:48:35.869 --> 00:48:39.220
is to beat a guy to death
with a book.

621
00:48:41.135 --> 00:48:42.745
Find anything on Conlan?

622
00:48:42.789 --> 00:48:43.964
No.

623
00:48:44.008 --> 00:48:46.053
He wants to rid the world
of money.

624
00:48:46.097 --> 00:48:47.925
yet he is playing Santa Claus.

625
00:48:47.968 --> 00:48:49.709
He does one thing. says another.

626
00:48:49.752 --> 00:48:53.452
I think that he wants the world
to believe he'’s an animal.

627
00:48:54.888 --> 00:48:56.455
So find out
who'’s holding the leash.

628
00:48:56.498 --> 00:48:57.935
Yes. ma'’am.

629
00:48:59.197 --> 00:49:02.983
The first question is.
where is my partner?

630
00:49:04.202 --> 00:49:06.595
You'’re a detective.
Figure it out.

631
00:49:10.034 --> 00:49:11.992
Thank you all for coming.

632
00:49:12.036 --> 00:49:14.864
I am putting Ricky Conlan
on notice.

633
00:49:14.908 --> 00:49:16.866
We will apprehend you.

634
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.870
I am also putting
the police department

635
00:49:20.914 --> 00:49:23.961
and Captain Anna Shea
on notice.

636
00:49:24.004 --> 00:49:26.964
I will come after you
if you fail in your directive.

637
00:49:27.007 --> 00:49:29.705
Ho! Ho!

638
00:49:29.749 --> 00:49:32.317
Ricky Conlan is not
some sort of Robin Hood.

639
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.448
Get down!

640
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:36.756
Merry fucking Christmas!

641
00:49:36.799 --> 00:49:38.018
Eyes on the ground.

642
00:49:38.062 --> 00:49:39.889
You understand the problem?

643
00:49:39.933 --> 00:49:42.675
You wanna see my face?
Look at me. motherfucker!

644
00:49:42.718 --> 00:49:44.198
Don'’t move!

645
00:49:44.242 --> 00:49:47.462
I want my present!

646
00:49:47.506 --> 00:49:49.899
He'’s a criminal
of the lowest kind.

647
00:49:49.943 --> 00:49:52.641
I am here to save you!

648
00:49:52.685 --> 00:49:54.817
Look at this god
you worship. Stand up.

649
00:49:55.949 --> 00:50:00.562
This is not Christmas!

650
00:50:02.651 --> 00:50:04.740
You wanna worship money
your whole life?

651
00:50:04.784 --> 00:50:07.613
You see how well it spends
when you'’re in hell.

652
00:50:08.962 --> 00:50:11.530
Wait. no. I have a family.

653
00:50:11.573 --> 00:50:13.662
Let'’s go.

654
00:50:13.706 --> 00:50:18.580
I urge you not to buy
into his call to arms.

655
00:50:18.624 --> 00:50:24.369
and see it as nothing
but a smoke screen
to hide his criminal activity.

656
00:50:24.412 --> 00:50:27.763
He is recruiting ex-convicts.

657
00:50:27.807 --> 00:50:30.418
He is attempting
to brainwash them...Merry Christmas.

658
00:50:30.462 --> 00:50:33.247
...so they can join his cause.

659
00:50:35.293 --> 00:50:38.600
If there is anyone found
aiding Ricky Conlan.

660
00:50:40.124 --> 00:50:42.082
you will feel the full force
of this city

661
00:50:42.126 --> 00:50:45.129
brought to bear upon your heads.

662
00:50:46.608 --> 00:50:48.393
Now. if you have any questions.

663
00:50:50.047 --> 00:50:53.093
ask Captain Anna Shea

664
00:50:53.137 --> 00:50:55.748
and see what answers
she gives you. Thank you.

665
00:50:57.315 --> 00:50:59.534
-Motherfucker!

666
00:50:59.578 --> 00:51:00.927
You wanna sell us out?

667
00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:04.409
Sell out a great man
like Conlan?

668
00:51:04.452 --> 00:51:07.760
I heard you call
your ball and chain.
motherfucker.

669
00:51:07.803 --> 00:51:10.154
The fuck is wrong with you?

670
00:51:11.024 --> 00:51:12.939
Oh. it'’s a long list. brother.

671
00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:17.509
He could have done for you
what he did for me.

672
00:51:17.552 --> 00:51:20.120
He took me from the streets
and gave me purpose.

673
00:51:20.164 --> 00:51:21.730
made me real.

674
00:51:23.167 --> 00:51:25.691
Disappointment is
a hell of a thing.

675
00:51:30.565 --> 00:51:32.698
Do unto others...

676
00:51:32.741 --> 00:51:35.570
...as you would have them
do unto you.

677
00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:39.531
You wanted them
to shoot me down like a dog.

678
00:51:39.574 --> 00:51:40.662
No.

679
00:51:40.706 --> 00:51:42.882
Why did you try
to cut a deal?

680
00:51:42.925 --> 00:51:44.449
Come on.
you were gonna burn my ass

681
00:51:44.492 --> 00:51:45.928
to save yours. weren'’t you?

682
00:51:45.972 --> 00:51:47.495
No. no. no. That'’s not what--

683
00:51:47.539 --> 00:51:50.194
-Don'’t you lie to me.
-Okay.

684
00:51:50.237 --> 00:51:53.327
Yeah. okay. I may be a liar.
but I'’m not fucking crazy.

685
00:51:57.288 --> 00:51:59.812
Well. in a society like this.

686
00:51:59.855 --> 00:52:03.381
being crazy could be
a beautiful thing.

687
00:52:03.424 --> 00:52:05.165
You know?

688
00:52:05.209 --> 00:52:09.778
So let me ask you one more time.

689
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:16.089
Did you try to cut a deal

690
00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:19.092
with the New York
pig department?F--

691
00:52:20.702 --> 00:52:22.835
All I'’m asking for
is the truth.

692
00:52:23.836 --> 00:52:26.273
All I want.
just the truth. son.

693
00:52:26.317 --> 00:52:29.711
Just fucking kill me. man.
Let'’s get it over with.

694
00:52:29.755 --> 00:52:32.801
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.
You don'’t understand.

695
00:52:32.845 --> 00:52:34.890
You don'’t under--
This is not your fault.

696
00:52:35.935 --> 00:52:37.502
No. no. Th--

697
00:52:37.545 --> 00:52:40.157
This is part of
the great deception
of the liars.

698
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.072
They used you
just like they used me.

699
00:52:43.116 --> 00:52:44.509
Don'’t you see?

700
00:52:44.552 --> 00:52:46.859
They distracted us
with all the-- the splendor.

701
00:52:46.902 --> 00:52:48.687
and the gold. and the--
and the-- and the--

702
00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:52.343
and the pageantry
and the theatrics. Right?

703
00:52:52.386 --> 00:52:55.128
"You'’re doing
such a good job. son.

704
00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:57.217
Well done
servicing your country."

705
00:52:57.261 --> 00:52:59.828
Right? Patriotism.
xenophobia.

706
00:52:59.872 --> 00:53:02.744
This jingoism
they filled in our heads.
and they walked us out there.

707
00:53:02.788 --> 00:53:04.485
And they gave you--

708
00:53:04.529 --> 00:53:06.618
They gave you a pigskin.

709
00:53:06.661 --> 00:53:08.794
And they said. "You carry it
from one end of the battlefield
to the other."

710
00:53:08.837 --> 00:53:11.492
And they handed me a rifle.
and they taught me how to kill.

711
00:53:11.536 --> 00:53:14.321
He knows things. man.
He'’s a truth teller.

712
00:53:14.365 --> 00:53:16.323
Hey. fuck you.

713
00:53:17.542 --> 00:53:19.674
No. no.
don'’t be angry at him.

714
00:53:19.718 --> 00:53:23.200
Come on. You'’re angry at the
system that left you deserted

715
00:53:23.243 --> 00:53:25.158
on the shores of poverty
and dissolution

716
00:53:25.202 --> 00:53:26.942
without a cause to believe in.

717
00:53:26.986 --> 00:53:28.596
But I'’ve got that fixed.

718
00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.902
'’Cause you and I are the same.

719
00:53:29.945 --> 00:53:32.252
We'’re both from
the same society.

720
00:53:33.732 --> 00:53:36.256
We didn'’t do anything
wrong here. We'’re not criminals.

721
00:53:37.388 --> 00:53:39.216
We'’re protagonists
in our own story.

722
00:53:39.259 --> 00:53:41.522
Sure. man. Yeah.

723
00:53:41.566 --> 00:53:44.569
I get it. that makes sense.
That makes sense. sure.

724
00:53:45.526 --> 00:53:47.006
I want the truth.

725
00:53:48.921 --> 00:53:52.011
I want the truth.

726
00:53:56.145 --> 00:53:58.452
Your faith isn'’t strong enough
to get you to the next chapter.

727
00:53:58.496 --> 00:53:59.540
my son.

728
00:54:01.107 --> 00:54:03.501
I got
to make you make a choice.

729
00:54:04.632 --> 00:54:06.068
I really hate doing this.

730
00:54:06.112 --> 00:54:07.635
but I have to
show you something.

731
00:54:07.679 --> 00:54:09.463
It'’s good. It's kind of bad.

732
00:54:09.507 --> 00:54:11.726
But one day. I promise.
you'’re gonna thank me for it.

733
00:54:20.082 --> 00:54:22.955
No. No. no. no! Fuck you!

734
00:54:22.998 --> 00:54:24.348
No!

735
00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:27.612
No. no. I tried--
I tried to fuck you. okay?

736
00:54:27.655 --> 00:54:29.657
I'’m a piece of shit. okay?

737
00:54:29.701 --> 00:54:31.268
I'’m-- I'm a drug addict.

738
00:54:31.311 --> 00:54:32.443
Just let them go.

739
00:54:32.486 --> 00:54:33.835
Fuck you! Let them go!

740
00:54:33.879 --> 00:54:35.402
Fuck you! Let them go!

741
00:54:35.446 --> 00:54:37.056
Shh.

742
00:54:43.758 --> 00:54:44.890
There you go.

743
00:54:44.933 --> 00:54:46.718
There you go. Look at me.

744
00:54:46.761 --> 00:54:48.241
Look at me. Look at me.

745
00:54:58.512 --> 00:55:00.862
Okay. okay. okay.

746
00:55:02.211 --> 00:55:04.301
That'’s the spirit.

747
00:55:04.344 --> 00:55:08.174
But you shoot me. they all die.

748
00:55:09.218 --> 00:55:12.874
Okay? You shoot yourself.
they all die.

749
00:55:14.485 --> 00:55:15.921
Okay. you have to
make a choice now.

750
00:55:15.964 --> 00:55:18.619
You have to make a choice
so you can be free.

751
00:55:18.663 --> 00:55:19.968
What'’s the choice?

752
00:55:20.969 --> 00:55:22.667
Bring him in.What?

753
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:24.669
Now make a decision
and set yourself free.

754
00:55:24.712 --> 00:55:26.192
Ah. fuck.

755
00:55:26.235 --> 00:55:27.933
Oh. it'’s your brother.

756
00:55:27.976 --> 00:55:30.501
He wasn'’t part of this.
This is me.

757
00:55:30.544 --> 00:55:32.416
This is the choice
that gives you your freedom.

758
00:55:32.459 --> 00:55:34.722
I alerted the cops.Your family
or your brother?

759
00:55:34.766 --> 00:55:36.898
Okay. we already know
what you'’re gonna choose.

760
00:55:36.942 --> 00:55:38.596
Right? Look what he'’s done
to you.

761
00:55:39.858 --> 00:55:43.383
He brought you to the bookie
that you had to kill.

762
00:55:43.427 --> 00:55:45.820
He-- He got you to--
to rob banks.

763
00:55:45.864 --> 00:55:48.562
He taught you how to shoot
a gun. That'’s the guy.

764
00:55:48.606 --> 00:55:49.868
Hurry it up. We got
a world to save.

765
00:55:49.911 --> 00:55:51.826
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

766
00:55:53.437 --> 00:55:55.177
Him or your family.

767
00:55:55.221 --> 00:55:56.962
One has to die.

768
00:55:57.005 --> 00:55:59.138
Come on. Casey. You'’ve already
made your fucking decision.

769
00:55:59.181 --> 00:56:00.966
Come on.

770
00:56:03.055 --> 00:56:04.230
Just do it.

771
00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.363
I'’m sorry. man.

772
00:56:06.406 --> 00:56:07.973
Fuck. I'’m sorry. brother.No. no.

773
00:56:09.496 --> 00:56:11.455
-I'’m so sorry.
-No. no. no. no. no. no!

774
00:56:16.938 --> 00:56:18.287
Fuck.

775
00:56:19.985 --> 00:56:21.769
I'’m sorry. but I had to see.

776
00:56:21.813 --> 00:56:23.597
Well. fuck you. man.

777
00:56:23.641 --> 00:56:25.251
You sick fuck.

778
00:56:25.294 --> 00:56:26.774
You actually pulled the trigger?

779
00:56:26.818 --> 00:56:28.515
I had to know for sure.

780
00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:30.430
You are a true believer.

781
00:56:30.474 --> 00:56:31.736
I knew you had it in you.

782
00:56:31.779 --> 00:56:34.478
I am so goddamn proud of you.

783
00:56:35.217 --> 00:56:36.741
Oh. Casey.

784
00:56:36.784 --> 00:56:37.916
My man.

785
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:42.268
What'’s wrong with you
fucking people?

786
00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:43.835
Look. I woke up this morning

787
00:56:43.878 --> 00:56:45.924
and I thought. my God.
I have everything

788
00:56:45.967 --> 00:56:49.188
I need in my life
except one thing.

789
00:56:49.231 --> 00:56:52.060
Yeah. what'’s that?

790
00:56:52.104 --> 00:56:53.627
Your fucking sanity?

791
00:56:56.282 --> 00:56:57.414
You.

792
00:57:03.202 --> 00:57:05.378
-Oh. fuck.

793
00:57:28.053 --> 00:57:29.446
When was the last time
you slept?

794
00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:32.144
I caught an hour
in the break room.

795
00:57:33.058 --> 00:57:35.321
We get any word from Knight?

796
00:57:35.364 --> 00:57:37.758
He'’s probably halfway
to Argentina by now.

797
00:57:38.846 --> 00:57:41.109
Nah. he wouldn'’t run
from a fight.

798
00:57:41.153 --> 00:57:42.807
Nah. you wanna think
the worst of him.

799
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:46.158
but he'’ll be there
when the time comes.No.

800
00:57:46.201 --> 00:57:48.421
You know. just because you
don'’t want something to happen

801
00:57:48.465 --> 00:57:50.162
doesn'’t mean it won't.

802
00:57:50.205 --> 00:57:52.338
I'’m a single mother. Fitz.

803
00:57:52.381 --> 00:57:55.297
I'’m well aware of making plans
and having God interfere.

804
00:57:57.386 --> 00:57:59.519
Seeing as how
you'’re already pissed off

805
00:57:59.563 --> 00:58:02.217
and messing around
in my city without authority...

806
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:08.789
What?

807
00:58:08.833 --> 00:58:09.921
Casey Rhodes.

808
00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:11.618
What about him?

809
00:58:12.924 --> 00:58:15.535
He busted out with Conlan
during the jailbreak.

810
00:58:15.579 --> 00:58:17.755
Called his wife.
She cut a deal with us.

811
00:58:17.798 --> 00:58:20.845
You cut a deal with the man who
put me in this fucking chair?

812
00:58:20.888 --> 00:58:23.369
I want my city to be safe.

813
00:58:23.412 --> 00:58:25.414
It'’s a means to an end.

814
00:58:27.591 --> 00:58:29.157
You find anything on Conlan?

815
00:58:31.725 --> 00:58:34.859
The guy'’s talking
like he'’s about to pull off

816
00:58:34.902 --> 00:58:37.078
the biggest heist in history.

817
00:58:38.471 --> 00:58:42.301
Look. I'’ve been doing some
research on potential targets.

818
00:58:42.344 --> 00:58:46.435
Okay? And right now. the record
is the Cali truck job in '’97.

819
00:58:46.479 --> 00:58:48.220
The take was over 30 mil.

820
00:58:49.003 --> 00:58:50.265
Mm-mmm.

821
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:53.051
Biggest heist was in '’75.

822
00:58:53.094 --> 00:58:55.401
Eight guys hit a secret bank
owned by the mob.

823
00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.709
A secret bank?

824
00:58:58.752 --> 00:59:02.147
Conlan may be crazy.
but he knows better than
to mess with the families.

825
00:59:03.496 --> 00:59:06.368
Yeah.Look. get some rest.

826
00:59:08.414 --> 00:59:10.024
Knight will be back
at some point.

827
00:59:11.373 --> 00:59:12.418
Yeah.

828
00:59:19.164 --> 00:59:21.775
Speak of the devil.

829
00:59:37.312 --> 00:59:39.706
They wanna put me on desk duty.
Can you believe that?

830
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:42.666
Probably for the best.Excuse me?

831
00:59:42.709 --> 00:59:45.451
Why. do you think if a guy
runs up a flight of stairs.

832
00:59:45.494 --> 00:59:46.583
I can'’t catch him?

833
00:59:47.932 --> 00:59:50.674
Oh. you'’re just
full of Christmas spirit.

834
00:59:50.717 --> 00:59:51.849
aren'’t you. huh?

835
00:59:51.892 --> 00:59:53.328
You old bastard.

836
00:59:54.939 --> 00:59:56.941
See. the games have changed.
my brother.

837
00:59:56.984 --> 01:00:00.074
There'’s no more rules.
There'’s no more codes.

838
01:00:00.858 --> 01:00:02.686
The game has changed.

839
01:00:02.729 --> 01:00:05.602
Yeah. Conlan isn'’t human.

840
01:00:07.473 --> 01:00:09.431
Look. the captain spoke
to the mayor.

841
01:00:09.475 --> 01:00:10.955
I spoke to the mayor.

842
01:00:10.998 --> 01:00:14.698
He-- He had this itinerary
on his desk.

843
01:00:14.741 --> 01:00:17.744
Some kind of meeting set up at.
I don'’t know.

844
01:00:17.788 --> 01:00:19.920
Wooddrake Antiques
or something.

845
01:00:19.964 --> 01:00:21.574
Can you believe that shit?

846
01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:24.272
That guy is out shopping
while his city is under siege

847
01:00:24.316 --> 01:00:25.622
from a madman.

848
01:00:26.884 --> 01:00:28.973
You wanna hear
something else crazy?

849
01:00:29.016 --> 01:00:31.497
Rhodes is cutting a deal
with the captain.

850
01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.064
And the DA is gonna go for it.

851
01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.676
Desperate times.

852
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.635
Christ. if I get
my fucking hands on Rhodes.

853
01:00:38.678 --> 01:00:40.985
I'’m gonna put my gun up his
ass. pull the trigger.

854
01:00:44.945 --> 01:00:46.164
Jesus Christ.

855
01:00:47.382 --> 01:00:49.558
You can'’t stop thinking
about him. can you?

856
01:00:49.602 --> 01:00:52.561
Just forget about this
and come back to LA.

857
01:00:52.605 --> 01:00:55.477
They have zero physical evidence
to lock you up.

858
01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:56.957
Your daughter misses you.

859
01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:59.090
Christ. I miss you.

860
01:00:59.133 --> 01:01:02.833
Do you know how much shit
Macey is giving me
for even being here?

861
01:01:04.312 --> 01:01:08.229
I'’ll be lucky if I'm not
divorced before New Year'’s.

862
01:01:10.928 --> 01:01:13.104
I am who I am.

863
01:01:13.147 --> 01:01:16.020
Okay. fine. You know what?
Don'’t listen to me.

864
01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:18.718
But Conlan isn'’t like
any other criminal.

865
01:01:20.024 --> 01:01:22.896
Don'’t let Conlan get
to you like Winna.

866
01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.419
You'’ll never come back.

867
01:01:25.377 --> 01:01:26.421
Well. you'’re wrong.

868
01:01:26.465 --> 01:01:28.293
No. I'’m your friend.

869
01:01:28.336 --> 01:01:31.949
You'’ve saved my life more times
than I'’ve had hot meals.

870
01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:35.822
and I feel like it'’s time
for me to repay the debt.

871
01:01:35.866 --> 01:01:40.522
Well. if Conlan kills me.
then so be it.

872
01:01:41.654 --> 01:01:42.699
Knight. I...

873
01:01:48.095 --> 01:01:49.357
And you know what?

874
01:01:49.401 --> 01:01:52.186
Fuck you for making me
all sentimental.

875
01:01:54.145 --> 01:01:55.189
Just come home.

876
01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.715
Don'’t-- Don't turn
into a monster

877
01:01:58.758 --> 01:02:00.586
by chasing a monster.

878
01:02:00.629 --> 01:02:02.240
Okay? That'’s all I ask.

879
01:02:11.684 --> 01:02:13.904
Just say grace
and I'’ll be there soon.

880
01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:17.081
Don'’t be so dramatic.

881
01:02:18.212 --> 01:02:20.258
The kids aren'’t gonna care
that I missed dinner

882
01:02:20.301 --> 01:02:22.564
when they see the presents
I got them.

883
01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:23.957
Ho.Okay.

884
01:02:33.053 --> 01:02:34.098
Jerome. drive.

885
01:02:41.932 --> 01:02:43.368
Oh. shit.

886
01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:45.109
Conlan said I would be spared.

887
01:02:45.152 --> 01:02:47.851
-He looked me right in the eye--
-Really?

888
01:02:47.894 --> 01:02:49.678
'’Cause he told me
to eat the rich.

889
01:02:51.071 --> 01:02:52.769
Wondering if he was
meaning that literally.

890
01:02:54.683 --> 01:02:56.598
I told Conlan where every bank
in this city

891
01:02:56.642 --> 01:02:58.992
was consolidating its valuables.

892
01:02:59.036 --> 01:03:00.777
We made a deal.Mmm.

893
01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:03.997
Well. he sent me to renegotiate.

894
01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:09.655
Have you seen my son?
Where'’s my son?

895
01:03:11.265 --> 01:03:12.310
Have you seen...

896
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.739
Boy. get your ass over here.

897
01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:52.524
Gonna miss my TED Talk.

898
01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:58.443
Now. I know Conlan is
a mad son of a bitch.

899
01:03:59.618 --> 01:04:01.098
But all the great ones are.

900
01:04:02.403 --> 01:04:04.492
That man has
shown me the truth.

901
01:04:04.536 --> 01:04:08.061
Every one of us has been
abused. used by the system.

902
01:04:08.105 --> 01:04:11.151
They have taken our time.
our life.

903
01:04:11.195 --> 01:04:13.588
They have put us in cages
for crimes that the 1%

904
01:04:13.632 --> 01:04:14.851
commit every day.

905
01:04:16.591 --> 01:04:19.594
This city belongs to us.

906
01:04:20.639 --> 01:04:23.860
It is ours.
And it always has been ours!

907
01:04:25.078 --> 01:04:27.602
And now it'’s time to make
everybody see the light.

908
01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:34.131
The plan is simple.

909
01:04:34.174 --> 01:04:38.918
Thanks to our new brother here.
the mayor will let us in.

910
01:04:38.962 --> 01:04:41.007
And we'’ll take it from there.

911
01:04:41.051 --> 01:04:44.358
No prisoners. no survivors.

912
01:04:45.838 --> 01:04:47.492
Some of you won'’t make it out.

913
01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:50.495
But upon your fallen bodies.

914
01:04:50.538 --> 01:04:52.932
we will build the foundation
of this great movement.

915
01:04:54.107 --> 01:04:57.371
One day. many years from now
when you'’re old.

916
01:04:57.415 --> 01:04:58.633
lying in your deathbed.

917
01:04:58.677 --> 01:05:01.114
you'’ll look up
at your loved ones

918
01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:03.029
and one moment

919
01:05:03.073 --> 01:05:04.988
will flash before your memory.

920
01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.773
This day.

921
01:05:07.816 --> 01:05:09.557
This moment of greatness.

922
01:05:12.212 --> 01:05:14.562
You'’re my brothers.
and I'’m proud of you.

923
01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.522
Hey.

924
01:05:18.697 --> 01:05:21.482
You came to me. remember?

925
01:05:21.526 --> 01:05:23.136
You said your father
held you down.

926
01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.311
He put his foot on you

927
01:05:24.355 --> 01:05:25.965
and pushed you to the ground.

928
01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:27.749
so he could rise up.

929
01:05:27.793 --> 01:05:29.534
And now what?

930
01:05:29.577 --> 01:05:32.972
Now you'’re alone?
No. you'’re one of us.

931
01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:36.584
You'’re part of our family.
You'’re in a real family now.

932
01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:38.543
I'’m proud of you.

933
01:05:38.586 --> 01:05:40.414
You made the right choice.

934
01:05:40.458 --> 01:05:43.461
'’Cause we will always
be there for you.

935
01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:48.379
Treat him the way you
treat each other.

936
01:05:48.422 --> 01:05:49.684
He'’s one of us now.

937
01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:02.784
You got this.

938
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:14.666
You'’re with us now.

939
01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:17.669
And you will do exactly
as we say.

940
01:06:17.712 --> 01:06:19.888
You speak when I tell you.

941
01:06:19.932 --> 01:06:22.021
You jump when I tell you.

942
01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:24.545
You shoot when I tell you.

943
01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.462
Now get dressed. bitch.

944
01:07:42.406 --> 01:07:43.624
Brother Knight.

945
01:07:45.409 --> 01:07:47.063
I hear you'’ve been chasing me.

946
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.414
What'’s the matter?

947
01:07:50.457 --> 01:07:52.938
Why haven'’t you caught me yet?
You growing old?

948
01:07:52.981 --> 01:07:54.287
Slowing down?

949
01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:56.072
Yeah. Traffic.

950
01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:57.160
Traffic. oh!

951
01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.510
Liar.

952
01:07:59.553 --> 01:08:01.468
God. how I hate liars.

953
01:08:01.512 --> 01:08:04.993
This city is full of liars.
hypocrites and thieves.

954
01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:06.082
Rhodes?

955
01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:07.561
Oh. yeah.

956
01:08:07.605 --> 01:08:09.737
He sees the big picture.

957
01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:12.218
The great liberation.

958
01:08:12.262 --> 01:08:13.915
He'’s a part of it now.

959
01:08:14.655 --> 01:08:16.135
I'’m like the North Star.

960
01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:18.572
guiding the way through
this cold Christmas night.

961
01:08:18.616 --> 01:08:21.706
And he'’s riding alongside
of me like Pegasus.

962
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:23.011
And all he wants--

963
01:08:23.055 --> 01:08:26.754
All he wants is to be
with his family.

964
01:08:28.278 --> 01:08:29.931
He'’s becoming one of us.

965
01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:32.456
He'’s like Saul
when he became Paul.

966
01:08:32.499 --> 01:08:34.762
Evolving into something
bigger and better.

967
01:08:34.806 --> 01:08:36.590
I'’m so proud.

968
01:08:36.634 --> 01:08:38.070
I never said he was smart.

969
01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:40.725
I miss you. James.

970
01:08:41.682 --> 01:08:43.554
I do. I miss us.

971
01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:48.124
Oh. we would have been
great together.

972
01:08:50.082 --> 01:08:51.388
It'’s too bad.

973
01:08:52.737 --> 01:08:55.087
There are no more cowboy cops.

974
01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.045
and they'’ve killed
all our heroes.

975
01:08:57.959 --> 01:08:59.439
It'’s just us.

976
01:09:01.224 --> 01:09:03.748
You think I'’m just robbing banks
and blowing up banks?

977
01:09:03.791 --> 01:09:04.792
So much more than that.

978
01:09:05.837 --> 01:09:07.447
You don'’t see the big picture.

979
01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.234
Christmas is about togetherness.

980
01:09:12.365 --> 01:09:15.716
It'’s not all this material shit.
Who cares?

981
01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.371
Toys and gadgets.
they don'’t mean anything.

982
01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:21.635
Hope.

983
01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:25.117
Hope is all that matters.

984
01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:27.032
And hope is a dangerous thing.

985
01:09:29.208 --> 01:09:30.688
One last time. James.

986
01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:33.256
Join me.

987
01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:34.996
Got any booze?

988
01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.781
Yeah.

989
01:09:36.824 --> 01:09:39.392
The mayor just told me where
he'’s keeping the good stuff.

990
01:09:39.436 --> 01:09:42.352
After tonight. I'’m gonna stay
drunk until Valentine'’s Day.

991
01:09:42.395 --> 01:09:44.789
It'’s gonna be like Fort Knox
for alcoholics over here.

992
01:09:48.401 --> 01:09:49.446
Join me.

993
01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:52.884
Last chance before
I change the world.

994
01:09:54.102 --> 01:09:57.889
This only ends
when one of us is dead.

995
01:09:58.933 --> 01:10:00.457
If you insist.

996
01:10:08.552 --> 01:10:09.988
Let'’s move!

997
01:10:13.426 --> 01:10:16.864
Brother Knight.
change takes sacrifice.

998
01:10:17.996 --> 01:10:19.432
The mayor just told me

999
01:10:19.476 --> 01:10:20.999
where he'’s keeping
the good stuff.

1000
01:10:21.042 --> 01:10:23.262
Some kind of meeting set up at.
I don'’t know.

1001
01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:25.395
Wooddrake Antiques
or something.

1002
01:10:33.577 --> 01:10:35.361
All right. chow'’s up.

1003
01:10:35.405 --> 01:10:37.015
Thank you for being here
on Christmas Day.

1004
01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:53.292
Well. it'’s nice to know
you remembered my number.

1005
01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:55.076
I know
where he'’s gonna hit.

1006
01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.383
Wooddrake Antiques.

1007
01:10:57.427 --> 01:10:59.777
It'’s a front for the 1%.

1008
01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:01.605
He wasn'’t robbing banks.

1009
01:11:02.388 --> 01:11:05.086
He was creating fear.

1010
01:11:06.436 --> 01:11:09.308
He made everyone put their
valuables in one place.

1011
01:11:09.352 --> 01:11:12.529
There'’s no reason
to rob a hundred banks

1012
01:11:12.572 --> 01:11:15.314
when you can just. you know.
rob one.

1013
01:11:16.881 --> 01:11:19.492
Well. that'’s some damn
fine work. Detective.

1014
01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:21.320
Don'’t move. Let me tell Shea.

1015
01:11:21.364 --> 01:11:23.757
You can'’t catch Conlan alone.
He'’s got nothing to lose.

1016
01:11:23.801 --> 01:11:26.673
If I can save just one person.
it'’s worth it.

1017
01:11:26.717 --> 01:11:28.066
That'’s what I do.

1018
01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:29.676
Hey. Knight. don'’t go
in there alone.

1019
01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.025
Kni-- Knight!

1020
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:35.029
Shit.

1021
01:11:55.833 --> 01:11:57.008
I'’m sorry.

1022
01:11:59.793 --> 01:12:00.925
He has my son.

1023
01:12:02.405 --> 01:12:04.015
They brainwashed my son.

1024
01:12:05.277 --> 01:12:06.757
He came willingly.

1025
01:12:10.108 --> 01:12:11.979
You broke
your promise. Conlan.

1026
01:12:17.376 --> 01:12:18.551
Listen to the politician

1027
01:12:18.595 --> 01:12:20.771
give us lectures
on broken promises.

1028
01:12:22.425 --> 01:12:25.950
The only promise I made was
to the Almighty himself.

1029
01:12:25.993 --> 01:12:30.433
I promised him to keep
heaven full of fresh souls.

1030
01:12:30.476 --> 01:12:34.306
So Rhodes here better be
enthusiastic in his support.

1031
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:38.049
or his beautiful wife. Lily.
and that sweet daughter. Clara.

1032
01:12:38.092 --> 01:12:39.964
are never gonna wake up
to open their presents on--

1033
01:12:40.007 --> 01:12:42.445
Please. Conlan.

1034
01:12:42.488 --> 01:12:44.011
We had a deal.

1035
01:12:45.926 --> 01:12:49.103
I can give you
anything you want.

1036
01:12:49.147 --> 01:12:50.888
I can give you
the keys to the city.

1037
01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:52.585
The keys to the city?

1038
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:56.415
Really? You can give me
the keys to the city?

1039
01:12:56.459 --> 01:12:58.504
I don'’t need
the keys to the city

1040
01:12:58.548 --> 01:13:01.725
when I have the keeper of
the keys right here in my van.

1041
01:13:01.768 --> 01:13:03.640
Not like this.

1042
01:13:03.683 --> 01:13:06.077
This is too far.

1043
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.558
You'’re gonna set
the city back 50 years.

1044
01:13:08.601 --> 01:13:10.298
No. no. no. my brother.

1045
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:14.738
I'’m going to propel
the city into the future.

1046
01:13:14.781 --> 01:13:17.654
We'’re gonna expose
the dark secrets of the elite.

1047
01:13:17.697 --> 01:13:19.264
So lock and load. brothers.

1048
01:13:19.307 --> 01:13:21.092
We got a job to do.

1049
01:13:23.311 --> 01:13:24.704
Smile. Mayor.

1050
01:13:24.748 --> 01:13:26.184
It'’s Christmas.

1051
01:13:56.867 --> 01:13:58.129
Let the games begin.

1052
01:14:00.784 --> 01:14:03.134
Gonna deck the halls
with blood. motherfuckers.

1053
01:14:03.177 --> 01:14:04.222
Let'’s go.

1054
01:14:04.265 --> 01:14:05.702
The other guys are in position.

1055
01:14:17.061 --> 01:14:18.454
I need to make a withdrawal.

1056
01:14:38.648 --> 01:14:39.692
How'’s it going?

1057
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.088
Hi.

1058
01:14:53.445 --> 01:14:55.316
You can come in now.

1059
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.014
Uh-uh. don'’t you move.

1060
01:15:04.891 --> 01:15:06.371
Let them have everything!

1061
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:09.548
Just give them what they want!

1062
01:15:11.855 --> 01:15:14.031
We don'’t have
to be given anything.

1063
01:15:15.075 --> 01:15:17.469
We'’re gonna take everything.

1064
01:15:20.385 --> 01:15:22.387
Let'’s get this party started.

1065
01:15:24.998 --> 01:15:31.004
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.

1066
01:15:31.048 --> 01:15:36.227
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.

1067
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:40.361
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.

1068
01:15:40.405 --> 01:15:43.451
Ho. Ho. Ho.

1069
01:15:43.495 --> 01:15:45.802
Jingle on this. bitches.

1070
01:16:26.799 --> 01:16:29.628
Please. don'’t shoot.
I'’m just the lookout.

1071
01:16:31.369 --> 01:16:33.545
It was never supposed
to be like this.

1072
01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:36.243
Conlan said we were
starting a revolution.

1073
01:16:36.287 --> 01:16:38.158
How many in there?

1074
01:16:38.202 --> 01:16:39.856
Ten. 15.

1075
01:16:40.508 --> 01:16:42.423
I don'’t know.

1076
01:16:42.467 --> 01:16:43.903
But they'’re all cons.

1077
01:16:43.947 --> 01:16:45.688
Hard-core.

1078
01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:47.820
I just wanted to be tough.

1079
01:16:47.864 --> 01:16:49.169
I bet you'’re tough now.

1080
01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:51.389
Fuck off.

1081
01:16:53.739 --> 01:16:58.135
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.

1082
01:16:58.178 --> 01:17:00.006
Don'’t move.

1083
01:17:03.444 --> 01:17:04.924
Move it.

1084
01:17:07.492 --> 01:17:09.146
Stay frosty. Santas.

1085
01:17:18.459 --> 01:17:19.765
Open the vault.

1086
01:17:20.548 --> 01:17:21.637
Move!

1087
01:17:39.045 --> 01:17:43.876
Oh. Merry Christmas.
my brothers.

1088
01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.270
Time to reap the rewards
of your loyalty.

1089
01:17:47.314 --> 01:17:49.099
All this just
to steal some shit?

1090
01:17:49.882 --> 01:17:51.144
No.

1091
01:17:51.188 --> 01:17:52.885
This is about
rebooting the system.

1092
01:17:52.929 --> 01:17:54.365
Oh. bullshit.

1093
01:17:54.408 --> 01:17:56.149
Bullshit. man.
You'’re nothing but a thief.

1094
01:17:56.933 --> 01:17:57.977
No.

1095
01:17:58.543 --> 01:18:00.110
I'’m no thief.

1096
01:18:00.153 --> 01:18:03.417
I'’m just a man who played
the system that made me.

1097
01:18:03.461 --> 01:18:04.984
Shit.

1098
01:18:05.028 --> 01:18:07.378
Part of you believes
in this mission.

1099
01:18:08.379 --> 01:18:10.860
I can see it in your eyes
right there.

1100
01:18:12.426 --> 01:18:13.601
Look at this.

1101
01:18:13.645 --> 01:18:15.691
Look at these riches.

1102
01:18:15.734 --> 01:18:17.823
We can overthrow
governments with this.

1103
01:18:18.911 --> 01:18:22.349
We can bring about
the great liberation.

1104
01:18:22.393 --> 01:18:25.918
This is the beginning
of the unbreaking of humanity.

1105
01:18:25.962 --> 01:18:28.268
My father taught me
to fix what'’s broken.

1106
01:18:29.792 --> 01:18:32.316
Your father was a cuck.

1107
01:18:32.359 --> 01:18:34.840
With the deep state'’s balls...

1108
01:18:36.799 --> 01:18:38.017
...tickling his tonsils.

1109
01:18:41.325 --> 01:18:43.936
My father taught me that
if you can'’t change the world.

1110
01:18:45.546 --> 01:18:46.722
bring it to its knees.

1111
01:18:50.464 --> 01:18:52.205
We are so close.

1112
01:18:52.815 --> 01:18:54.730
So close.

1113
01:18:55.992 --> 01:18:57.297
Don'’t you understand?

1114
01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:03.129
They killed my son
with their fake wars.

1115
01:19:04.957 --> 01:19:07.612
I will end them before
they do that to your child.

1116
01:19:09.309 --> 01:19:10.789
I'’m doing this for you.

1117
01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.836
Help me. I beg you.

1118
01:19:15.228 --> 01:19:16.926
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1119
01:19:16.969 --> 01:19:18.623
Listen to me.

1120
01:19:18.666 --> 01:19:20.320
Christmas is about togetherness.

1121
01:19:21.104 --> 01:19:22.148
I need you.

1122
01:19:23.454 --> 01:19:25.456
I need you to help these men
bring out that loot.

1123
01:19:26.631 --> 01:19:29.852
Do that. and I swear
on the baby in the manger.

1124
01:19:29.895 --> 01:19:31.244
I will let your family go.

1125
01:19:41.385 --> 01:19:43.561
We'’re out of here
in four minutes. Santas.

1126
01:19:47.478 --> 01:19:48.653
You did good.

1127
01:20:13.025 --> 01:20:15.593
Stupid-ass elites think
they can hide their pearls

1128
01:20:15.636 --> 01:20:16.986
in a closed-down bank.

1129
01:20:18.901 --> 01:20:22.339
Yeah. this shit got to be
at least nine figures
once it'’s fenced.

1130
01:20:22.382 --> 01:20:24.863
Money is just a way
of keeping score.

1131
01:20:24.907 --> 01:20:27.692
We'’ll redistribute the wealth
of the world.

1132
01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:31.827
We did it. Dajon.

1133
01:20:33.741 --> 01:20:34.742
Okay. I'’m done.

1134
01:20:36.222 --> 01:20:37.963
You'’re done
when I say you'’re done.No. no. no. no.

1135
01:20:38.007 --> 01:20:40.052
I helped you get your little
fucking war chest thing. okay--

1136
01:20:40.096 --> 01:20:42.272
This is not a negotiation.I'’m fucking done.

1137
01:20:42.315 --> 01:20:44.187
Get your fucking hands
off me.

1138
01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:45.318
I have your wife.

1139
01:20:46.276 --> 01:20:47.407
I have your daughter.

1140
01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:50.846
You'’re one of us now.

1141
01:20:50.889 --> 01:20:51.934
Act like it.

1142
01:21:10.169 --> 01:21:11.779
Hey! Who are you?

1143
01:21:11.823 --> 01:21:14.173
What the-- Oh. fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1144
01:21:14.217 --> 01:21:15.871
What the fuck is that?
Is that a grenade?

1145
01:21:15.914 --> 01:21:17.873
Fuck. fuck. fuck! Where
did it go? Where did it go?

1146
01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:50.557
Hurry the fuck up. He'’s here.

1147
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.520
Come on. go! Come on. go!

1148
01:22:19.847 --> 01:22:21.153
The fuck is all that?

1149
01:22:23.112 --> 01:22:24.591
Fuck is all that?

1150
01:22:24.635 --> 01:22:26.245
You tip '’em off?

1151
01:22:26.289 --> 01:22:27.333
He'’s here.

1152
01:22:30.206 --> 01:22:32.730
Where are you hiding. Detective?

1153
01:22:32.773 --> 01:22:34.166
I can smell you.

1154
01:22:37.387 --> 01:22:39.084
Fear everywhere. buddy.

1155
01:22:39.128 --> 01:22:42.435
You handsome bald devil.
come out and play.

1156
01:22:42.479 --> 01:22:43.959
Ho. ho. ho.

1157
01:22:49.747 --> 01:22:53.838
Hello. Detective.

1158
01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:57.320
Nothing better to do
on Christmas Eve?

1159
01:22:57.363 --> 01:22:59.670
This is as good
as it gets for me.

1160
01:22:59.713 --> 01:23:02.455
Well. with friends like us.
who needs family?

1161
01:23:05.589 --> 01:23:06.677
Am I right?

1162
01:23:11.725 --> 01:23:12.900
This is how it'’s gonna go.

1163
01:23:12.944 --> 01:23:14.424
I'’ll tell you how.

1164
01:23:14.467 --> 01:23:17.470
I'’m gonna shove a Christmas tree
up your ass...

1165
01:23:18.471 --> 01:23:20.125
...and set it on fire.

1166
01:23:20.169 --> 01:23:22.301
A Christmas tree up my ass?

1167
01:23:22.345 --> 01:23:23.955
All the way.

1168
01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.826
Okay. okay.

1169
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:27.741
You'’re even kinkier
than I thought. Detective.

1170
01:23:27.785 --> 01:23:28.829
But I like that.

1171
01:23:29.613 --> 01:23:30.701
No foreplay. okay?

1172
01:23:32.311 --> 01:23:35.706
You'’re gonna make sure
we walk out of here
free and clear.

1173
01:23:35.749 --> 01:23:38.230
Why? Because you have
a gun to his head?

1174
01:23:39.188 --> 01:23:40.580
The fuck do I care?

1175
01:23:41.494 --> 01:23:42.626
Shoot him.

1176
01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.715
What?

1177
01:23:44.758 --> 01:23:46.369
You shot my partner.

1178
01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:51.461
See what I'’m dealing with here?

1179
01:23:51.504 --> 01:23:53.724
He sold you up the river.
Rhodes.

1180
01:23:53.767 --> 01:23:55.334
You mean nothing to him.

1181
01:23:55.378 --> 01:23:56.814
Less than nothing.

1182
01:23:57.945 --> 01:23:59.512
Less than nothing. Wow.

1183
01:23:59.556 --> 01:24:00.948
You'’re cold. Detective.

1184
01:24:02.559 --> 01:24:03.603
Wow.

1185
01:24:06.215 --> 01:24:09.914
Dajon. you forgot to
get me a Christmas present.

1186
01:24:11.394 --> 01:24:14.614
I would like this motherfucker'’s
head in my stocking. please.

1187
01:24:15.833 --> 01:24:17.443
Would someone
just kill him?

1188
01:24:18.923 --> 01:24:22.187
Where is your Christmas spirit.
Detective Knight?

1189
01:24:31.109 --> 01:24:33.068
Dajon. quit fucking around.

1190
01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:35.766
You let that pretty boy
kick your ass?

1191
01:24:40.423 --> 01:24:42.860
I trained you better than that.
you little pussy.

1192
01:24:47.778 --> 01:24:49.214
I'’m coming. boss!

1193
01:24:57.614 --> 01:24:59.355
-Fuck.

1194
01:25:00.182 --> 01:25:01.574
Uh-oh.

1195
01:25:08.146 --> 01:25:10.583
Sounds like Santa Claus didn'’t
give you enough ammunition

1196
01:25:10.627 --> 01:25:12.063
for this party.

1197
01:25:13.717 --> 01:25:15.501
Don'’t you worry.

1198
01:25:15.545 --> 01:25:17.634
Father Conlan has
more than enough bullets

1199
01:25:17.677 --> 01:25:18.722
to share with you.

1200
01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:25.946
You were right again. Knight.

1201
01:25:26.904 --> 01:25:28.297
This only ends
with one of us dead.

1202
01:25:31.474 --> 01:25:33.171
Merry Christmas. motherfucker.

1203
01:25:51.755 --> 01:25:53.365
How you doing. brother?

1204
01:26:03.549 --> 01:26:05.986
You f-- Oh.

1205
01:26:09.642 --> 01:26:10.730
Wow.

1206
01:26:12.297 --> 01:26:14.299
Didn'’t see that coming.

1207
01:26:32.926 --> 01:26:34.058
Are we good?

1208
01:26:34.101 --> 01:26:36.016
I mean. not. you know.
good good.

1209
01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:39.019
But good enough?

1210
01:26:39.063 --> 01:26:42.675
I'’m gonna give you five seconds
before I lube up my gun.

1211
01:26:43.633 --> 01:26:45.112
What the fuck does that mean?

1212
01:26:45.156 --> 01:26:47.202
Well. I guess you'’re gonna
find out in four.

1213
01:26:47.985 --> 01:26:49.334
One.

1214
01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:51.293
Two.

1215
01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:53.208
Three.

1216
01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:06.090
It'’s gonna be okay.

1217
01:27:10.747 --> 01:27:11.922
Mom!

1218
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.626
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.

1219
01:27:25.065 --> 01:27:29.287
It'’s gonna
be okay. It'’s okay.

1220
01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:31.376
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1221
01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:32.856
Thank you. thank you.

1222
01:27:32.899 --> 01:27:34.292
Arthur!

1223
01:27:35.293 --> 01:27:36.990
Arthur. where are you?

1224
01:27:37.034 --> 01:27:39.297
Freeze! NYPD!

1225
01:27:39.341 --> 01:27:41.473
Put it down! Hands
where we can see them.

1226
01:27:41.517 --> 01:27:42.692
I'’m looking for my son.

1227
01:27:43.649 --> 01:27:44.868
Arthur Vassetti.

1228
01:27:46.391 --> 01:27:48.437
Please. help me find my son.

1229
01:27:52.092 --> 01:27:53.137
Where is my son?

1230
01:27:54.181 --> 01:27:55.879
My son'’s name
is Arthur Vassetti.

1231
01:27:57.010 --> 01:27:59.361
Ricky Conlan took my son!

1232
01:27:59.404 --> 01:28:02.755
Did Conlan meet
your son at church?Where'’s my son. Arthur?

1233
01:28:02.799 --> 01:28:05.062
How long were
you working for Conlan?

1234
01:28:05.105 --> 01:28:07.804
Lock him up!
Lock him up!

1235
01:28:07.847 --> 01:28:09.806
Ricky Conlan has my son.

1236
01:28:11.198 --> 01:28:12.548
Find my son!

1237
01:28:49.628 --> 01:28:51.717
You'’re the gift that keeps
on giving.

1238
01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:58.115
You win.

1239
01:29:04.469 --> 01:29:06.776
Don'’t let them put me in a cage.

1240
01:29:08.821 --> 01:29:10.388
I'’m not going back.

1241
01:29:12.042 --> 01:29:13.130
Kill me.

1242
01:29:13.957 --> 01:29:16.133
Do it.

1243
01:29:27.666 --> 01:29:29.407
Merry Christmas. motherfucker.

1244
01:29:29.451 --> 01:29:30.800
Ho!

1245
01:31:25.392 --> 01:31:28.395
The State calls to the stand
Detective Fitzgerald.

1246
01:31:34.576 --> 01:31:37.056
Good to see you
on your feet again. Fitz.

1247
01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:39.624
Anything to make you happy.
Mason.

1248
01:31:39.668 --> 01:31:41.278
How about you save us all
a bunch of time

1249
01:31:41.321 --> 01:31:43.193
and tell us the real truth
about your partner?

1250
01:31:44.542 --> 01:31:46.152
Oh. where do I begin?

1251
01:31:46.196 --> 01:31:47.893
Knight was cleared
for the extraordinary events

1252
01:31:47.937 --> 01:31:50.069
in New York City
and the prosecutor lacks

1253
01:31:50.113 --> 01:31:52.158
the evidence he needs
to charge him for the murder

1254
01:31:52.202 --> 01:31:54.683
of one Jerry Leach
which. ipso facto.

1255
01:31:54.726 --> 01:31:56.859
does not make that guy innocent.

1256
01:31:56.902 --> 01:31:58.295
Ipso facto?

1257
01:31:58.338 --> 01:31:59.775
Who gives a fuck?

1258
01:32:00.776 --> 01:32:03.343
No one'’s crying for Jerry Leach.

1259
01:32:03.387 --> 01:32:07.173
The man was a convicted murderer
who got off on a technicality.

1260
01:32:08.087 --> 01:32:09.611
If Knight killed him.

1261
01:32:09.654 --> 01:32:12.570
it was only to stop him
before he hurt someone else.

1262
01:32:12.614 --> 01:32:15.225
Detective.
is the world a safer place

1263
01:32:15.268 --> 01:32:17.357
with Knight behind bars
or behind a badge?

1264
01:32:17.401 --> 01:32:20.360
Honestly. where do I begin?

1265
01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:25.931
He'’s moody. disorganized.
he drives fast.

1266
01:32:25.975 --> 01:32:27.280
talks shit all day.

1267
01:32:27.324 --> 01:32:28.891
He'’s a workaholic.

1268
01:32:28.934 --> 01:32:31.458
I once caught him teaching
my eldest son

1269
01:32:31.502 --> 01:32:34.200
to do e-brake turns
in a parking lot.

1270
01:32:34.244 --> 01:32:37.726
Okay. my son Sam is nine.
Nine years old.

1271
01:32:37.769 --> 01:32:41.468
And he didn'’t think that
he was doing anything wrong.

1272
01:32:41.512 --> 01:32:45.211
He has yet to pick up a check.
not once in the eight years

1273
01:32:45.255 --> 01:32:47.126
that we'’ve been partners.

1274
01:32:47.170 --> 01:32:51.304
Let'’s just say
this guy is an asshole.

1275
01:32:52.436 --> 01:32:54.264
But it'’s not his job
to be liked.

1276
01:32:55.657 --> 01:32:58.834
This man has more experience
than the rest of the guys

1277
01:32:58.877 --> 01:33:01.314
in the department combined.

1278
01:33:01.358 --> 01:33:04.622
He'’s the first man on the
scene. He'’s the first man
through the door.

1279
01:33:04.666 --> 01:33:07.016
This guy is a cop.

1280
01:33:09.627 --> 01:33:11.020
And we are all much safer

1281
01:33:12.195 --> 01:33:14.066
with James Knight
behind the badge.

1282
01:33:15.764 --> 01:33:17.983
After hearing
two dozen testimonies

1283
01:33:18.027 --> 01:33:19.985
assessing victim
impact statements

1284
01:33:20.029 --> 01:33:23.119
and his past cases.
the department recommends that

1285
01:33:23.162 --> 01:33:26.513
James Knight be reinstated
effective immediately.

1286
01:33:27.514 --> 01:33:29.386
Congratulations. Detective.
