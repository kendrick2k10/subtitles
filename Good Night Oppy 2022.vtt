Over the centuries.

00:06:07.493 --> 00:06:10.662
Mars has been this enigmatic

60
00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:13.165
little red dot in the sky.

61
00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:18.212

What could be going on
in that distant land?

63
00:06:28.097 --> 00:06:31.600
STROUPE:
The overall goal of the whole Mars program

64
00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:36.271
has been the question of:
Did Mars ever actually have life?

65
00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:39.274
So. especially early on
in the Mars missions.

66
00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:40.776
we were following the water.

67
00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:46.949
That's because. at least on Earth.
everywhere that we find water...

68
00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:50.911

71
00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.172
Was there water on Mars?

72
00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:04.883
And what kind of water?

73
00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:08.137
And could that have helped sustain life?

74
00:07:12.391 --> 00:07:15.144

the two Viking missions

75
00:07:15.227 --> 00:07:18.147
were kind of the epitome
of exploration at the time.

76
00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:21.984
NASA sent two orbiters and two landers.

77
00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:25.863

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:26.723
So. one day. I opened a radio.
and I was disappointed

177
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.808
to find there were no people in the radio.

178
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.144
So that's my fascination with engineering.

179
00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:35.482
BOYKINS:
For the rover design...

180
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:40.737
...it was a deliberate decision
to make the characteristics humanlike.

181
00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:46.284
TREBI-OLLENNU:
When you're a geologist

182
00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:48.662
and you're working in the field.
you typically take the rock

183
00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.789
and then break it up to look inside of it.

184
00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:55.001
So the robot needs the robotic arm

185
00:13:55.085 --> 00:14:00.423
that has multiple instruments to take
measurements and microscopic images.

186
00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:03.260
Like a Swiss Army knife.

187
00:14:07.973 --> 00:14:10.517
SQUYRES: Now. the resolution
of the rovers' cameras is

188
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.811
the exact equivalent
of human 20/20 vision.

189
00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:18.775
So. all of a sudden. they start to look
an awful lot like eyeballs.

190
00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:24.781
BOYKINS: And then the height
of the rover was five foot two.

191
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.075
That's the average height
of a human being.

192
00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:33.707
So it would feel like. as the rover
was driving. taking these images.

193
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.001
that a human being
was walking along the surface.

194
00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:42.090
ELLISON:
It's just a box of wires. right?

195
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.052
But you end up with this

196
00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:50.140
cute-ish-looking robot that has a face.

197
00:14:52.601 --> 00:14:56.646
TROSPER: So we had these
amazing science instruments.

198
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.649
but once you put all that stuff
on the rover.

199
00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:01.109
the mass gets bigger.

200
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:07.032
Then this is gonna be a big problem
for landing on Mars.

201
00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.451
But then what I'm trying to look at
is actually literally using

202
00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:13.079
six little bungee cords
attached here to airbags.

203
00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:16.082
And the challenge here is that there's
a lot of different ways to do this.

204
00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.043
A lot of different ways to do this.

205
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:21.546
We don't know which one is the best.
and we really only get one shot at it.

206
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.798
TROSPER:
So our landing system

207
00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:27.385
had these big airbags that inflated.

208
00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:29.846
And they would bounce it
across the surface.

209
00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:33.099
MANNING:
The biggest problem right off the bat--

210
00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:35.602
we started doing the math for how much
the Spirit and Opportunity

211
00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:37.812
were going to weigh.

212
00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:40.148
and will those airbags
be able to handle that weight?

213
00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.111
So we started doing tests.

214
00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:47.489
-What the...?
-This is just dandy.

215
00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.616
-This is not a problem. Yeah.
-No. this is a... this is a good rock.

216
00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:51.910
-I like this rock.
-Yes.

217
00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:54.037
TROSPER:
And so we were trying out the airbags

218
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.248
with the types of rocks
we could encounter on Mars.

219
00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:59.042
We do the first big drop.

220
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.005
(laughing):
Huge gaping holes in these airbags

221
00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:08.301
get ripped by the rocks. and we're like.
"Oh. this is not good.

222
00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:09.928
Not good at all."

223
00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:13.556
MANNING: The parachutes were
another story altogether.

224
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.059
MAN (over speaker):
Three. two. one.

225
00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:20.063
MANNING: But we did those tests
with this big rocket-shaped payload

226
00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:22.732
and dropped it out of the sky
from a helicopter.

227
00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:26.736
First one. the parachute tore to shreds.

228
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.905
(helicopter blades whirring)

229
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.700
The second one...

230
00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:33.243
MAN:
Oh!

231
00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:34.744
MANNING:
...was torn to shreds.

232
00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.457
And so we realized
we didn't have a working parachute.

233
00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:43.336
Unfortunately. that chute
that just exploded was the chute

234
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.880
that we were planning on taking to Mars.

235
00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:49.384
Cut to the quick.
You're in very. very serious trouble.

Where are you concerned?

238

that these guys have come to me with.

239
00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:59.018
and I've added all those threats up.

240
00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:02.939
They go in the category of everything
we can think of that can go wrong.

to come to a reasonable conclusion
that there was once water on Mars

633
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.567
was right there
in the walls of Eagle Crater.

634
00:42:08.944 --> 00:42:10.862
But...

635
00:42:10.946 --> 00:42:13.240
this is a very acidic environment.

636
00:42:14.783 --> 00:42:17.619
Not a place where life
could have developed.

637
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.581
So. yes. there had been liquid water.

that you or I would want to drink.

640
00:42:30.382 --> 00:42:32.801
It was basically like battery acid.

641

You would not want
to put your toes in there.

642
00:42:37.639 --> 00:42:39.683
You probably wouldn't have
any toes left if you did.

...you've got to go
on a bit of a road trip.

00:43:04.958 --> 00:43:07.585
But the problem is

647
00:43:07.669 --> 00:43:10.964
these rovers only have 90 days to live.

648
00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:29.274

It's such a fun job. but you can't

651
00:43:35.405 --> 00:43:37.365
just use a steering wheel to drive it.

652
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:41.745
Because it takes anywhere
from four minutes to 20 minutes

653
00:43:41.828 --> 00:43:44.664
for a signal to reach Mars.

654
00:43:44.748 --> 00:43:48.460
So we'd send the commands.
we then go off and sleep...

655
00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:53.256
...and then the rover will execute
the drive that day.

656
00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.633
And by the time the drive is done.

657
00:43:55.717 --> 00:43:57.677
we come back
and we get the results of that

658
00:43:57.761 --> 00:43:59.596
and start planning again.

659
00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:03.099
I grew up in India.

660
00:44:03.183 --> 00:44:05.685
And when I was about seven years old.

661
00:44:05.769 --> 00:44:08.813
somebody gave me this book
which was about space exploration.

662
00:44:08.897 --> 00:44:10.648
and I was just blown away.

663
00:44:12.525 --> 00:44:15.195
Did you see how close we get
to that rock in the beginning?

664
00:44:15.278 --> 00:44:19.324
During the mission.
I was pregnant with the twins.

665
00:44:19.407 --> 00:44:23.828
And so it was a different way
for me to relate to the twin rovers.

666
00:44:23.912 --> 00:44:27.207
I thought about these two beings that are

667
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:29.626
so connected and so similar

668
00:44:29.709 --> 00:44:33.129
and yet are going to have
completely independent lives.

669
00:44:35.924 --> 00:44:38.051
The rovers have their own personality.

670
00:44:38.134 --> 00:44:42.806
and it's hard for me to pick
which one of them is my favorite.

671
00:44:42.889 --> 00:44:44.516
Can't really pick one. you know.

672
00:44:44.599 --> 00:44:46.601
