Hi. everybody! Doc McStuffins here.

24
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.940
I'm so glad you could join us.

25
00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:09.527
because today is a super fun
and special day...

26
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.196
It's my birthday!

27
00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:12.739
It's her birthday.

28
00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:13.948
The only thing is.

29
00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.326
I'm not sure what to do
for my birthday party.

30
00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.745
Do you have any ideas?

31
00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:20.997
You do? Then maybe you can help me!

32
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.166
I know that with the help of my friends.

33
00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.587
this is going to be the best party ever!

34
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.216
(giggling) Oh. there's something
I forgot to tell you.

35
00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.134
We have a special phrase today.

36
00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:36.137
Whenever someone says.
"best party ever"...

37
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.765
(giggles)

38
00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:39.974
That happens!

39
00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:41.684
(cheering)

40
00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.436
Okay. who's got a good idea

41
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.647
to help us get this party started?

42
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.190
(ringing)

43
00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:50.401
That sounds like I'm getting a video call.

44
00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:53.655
Oh. look! It's my friend Emery! Hi. Emery!

45
00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:57.158
Hi. Doc! I got here as fast as I could.

46
00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:59.744
-I heard you need some help.
-DOC: I sure do!

47
00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:02.372
I could use some ideas for this party.

48
00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:05.166
Hmm. My diagnosis?

49
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.044
Oh. you have I'm-All-Out-Of-Ideas-itosis.

50

-(giggles)
-Well. "Doc".

52
00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:14.968
do you have any ideas
that might help us?

53
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.262
Yep! For my last birthday.

54
00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:20.098
I had all my friends over for a party!

55
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.724
DOC: That's a great idea!

56
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.852
You can't have a party without friends.

57
00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:26.938
My mom and I
made the invitations ourselves.

58
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:28.439
I drew the pictures.

59
00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.775
and mom helped me send them to everyone.

60
00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.696
Oh. look!
There's me zip lining. and a unicorn.

61
00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.115
And those are some friends that I invited.

62
00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:39.242
-Invite your friends.
-Got it.

63
00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.162
EMERY: <i>We played games</i>
<i>and had birthday cake.</i>

64
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.622
Oh. we even had a bounce house!

65
00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.791
We jumped all around...

66
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.627
like this.

67
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.296
like this.

68
00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.423
Oh. and even like this!

69
00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.799

70
00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:56.843
My friend Boppy lives in a bounce house.

Wow. just like my party!

76
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:13.943
But Mommy said we had to take
turns in the bounce house

77
00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.821
and be careful not to bump
into each other.

78
00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.698
We made a game out of it!

79
00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:20.617
Your mom sounds really smart.

80
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.577
And so do you!

Hey. I'm inviting all my friends
to my birthday party.

112
00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.162
You wanna come too?

113
00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.999
Yes. yes. yes. yes. Yes!

(chuckles)

115
00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.294
I'll take that as a "Yes."

See you at the party!

117
00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.758
Someone's calling on the "toysponder."

118
00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:04.262
Maybe they can help me
with more ideas for the party!

119
00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:06.514
-Hi. Doc!
-DOC: Hey. Madison!

120
00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:08.016
Andrew. she's here!

121
00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.435
Come say hi to Doc McStufffins!

122
00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:13.438
(panting) Hi. Doc.

123
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.148
How's it's going?

124
00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:16.816
I'm fine. Andrew.

125
00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:19.235
but I can hear that breathing.

126
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.195
and it doesn't sound too good.

127
00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.780
Andrew has asthma.

128
00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.907
He sometime she has trouble breathing.

129
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.702
When I play hard. my chest gets tight

130
00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:29.537
and it's harder to breathe.

131
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.748
DOC: Maybe you should take a break.

132
00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.375
My mom's a doctor.
and she says it always helps

133
00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:35.835
to stop and rest.

134
00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:39.005
(panting) That's what our mom says too.

135
00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:40.882
And so does our doctor.

136
00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:42.508
But Andrew never listens!

137
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.470
It's just so hard to stop having fun!

138
00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:47.305
When we're having trouble breathing.

139
00:05:47.388 --> 00:05:50.558
it's important to slow down
and just breathe.

140
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:54.228
I remember when my friend Winnie
had a very similar problem.

141
00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:56.981
Wait 'till you see this.

142
00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.108
Um. Winnie. maybe you shouldn't do that.

(inhales deeply. blowing)

144
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.446

149
00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.792
Don't worry. Winnie. I'll fix you.

while you were telling us about Winnie.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.659

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.164
Now that I can breathe better.

177
00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.082
I can help you blow the balloons up!

178
00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.584
Me too!

179
00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:41.252
That would be a huge help!

180
00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:42.712
You're both invited.

181
00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:46.549
DOC: <i>And I'm adding you</i>
<i>to my Big Book of Birthday Buddies!</i>

182
00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:48.676
-All right!
-All right! Yeah!

183
00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:50.720
See you at the party!

184
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.223
Balloons. bounce house.

185
00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:55.850
and lots of friends.

186
00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:58.686
I've got so many great ideas
for our party now!

187
00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:02.273
But I just got a message
from my friend Aryana.

188
00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:05.109
who says she has
another great idea for us.

189
00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.819
Hi. Aryana!

190
00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.905
Hi. Aryana's Mom and Dad!

191
00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:09.989
Hi. Doc!

192
00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:13.534
I can't believe
we're talking to the one and only.

193
00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.328
Doc McStuffins!

194
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:16.871
Is it really you?

195
00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:19.123
(chuckles) It's really me!

196
00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:21.501
And I can't wait to hear
your idea for our party.

197
00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.961
Well. my best friend just invited me

198
00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.755
to a birthday party sleepover.

199
00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:28.883
A sleepover! Why didn't I think of that?

200
00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:31.719
You know. we once had
a sleepover with all my friends

201
00:08:31.802 --> 00:08:33.262
<i>right here in this bedroom.</i>

202
00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.098
Who's ready for our big sleepover party?

203
00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.433
We are!

204
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:41.187
(grunts) Oh. I love sleepover parties!

205
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.232
How do you all like
my fancy-pantsy new pajamas?

206
00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:46.734
Lambie. those are prettier
than pumpkin pie!

207
00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:48.361
(scoffs) I know!

208
00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:50.613
What are we gonna do at the party. Doc?

209
00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:53.658
We're gonna play games. tell stories...

210
00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:55.576
(gasps) sleep in sleeping bags...

211
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.663
And have a pajama fashion show?

212
00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:00.039
Sure! (giggles)

213
00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:01.749
And I have a surprise.

214
00:09:01.832 --> 00:09:04.502
Someone special is coming to our party!

215
00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:06.003
DOC: <i>I'll give you a hint.</i>

216
00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.713
He's really brave!

217
00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.882
It must be me!

218
00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:11.300
Sorry. Stuffy.

219
00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.302
It's...

220
00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.054
Aha!

221
00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:17.473
-(Lambie gasps)
-CHILLY: Sir Kirby!

222
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.976
Yes! 'Tis I. Sir Kirby.

223
00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:23.604
the bravest knight
in all of McStuffins kingdom!

224
00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:26.774
I wish I could be brave like Sir Kirby.

225
00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:28.025
What do you mean?

226
00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.569
She's a little worried

227
00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.195
about her friend's sleepover party.

228
00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.824
You see. sometimes Aryana
gets afraid of the dark.

229
00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:38.077
DOC: <i>Hmm. Is that right. Aryana?</i>

230
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.663
You sound just like
the brave knight Sir Kirby!

231
00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:42.957
I do? How?

232
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.709
DOC: <i>On the night of our sleepover.</i>

233
00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:47.211
<i>Sir Kirby started acting kinda nervous.</i>

234
00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:50.923
<i>And he got really shaky</i>
<i>every time we turned out the lights.</i>

235
00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:54.635
Sir Kirby.
your heart is beating really fast.

236
00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.012
That's why you're so sweaty.

237
00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:58.806
Sometimes. when someone is breathing fast

238
00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:00.099
and shaking and sweating.

239
00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:02.268
it means they're scared.

240
00:10:02.351 --> 00:10:04.937
Is there anything you're scared of?

241
00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:07.315
Me? Scared?

242
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.900
Need I remind you that I am Sir Kirby.

243
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.820
the bravest knight
in all of McStuffins kingdom!

244
00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:14.488
Why. I have fought dragons.

245
00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:17.908
saved princesses.
and conquered evil kings!

246
00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.369
And that's all so amazing.

247
00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:23.205
but have you ever been scared?

248
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:28.210
(whispering) The truth is. Doc.

249
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.670
when it's very dark.

250
00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:32.048
I always feel like this.

251
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.300
shaky and sweaty.

252
00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:36.093
I think I am scared.

253
00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:37.678
I think so. too.

254
00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:41.932
I have a diagnosis.

255
00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:45.603
You. sir. have a severe case
of The DarkWillies.

256
00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:47.355
It means you're afraid of the dark.

257
00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:50.399
Now. to know how to treat you.

258
00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:54.278
I need to know exactly
what caused your DarkWillies.

259
00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.739
Was there something you saw

260
00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.658
that scared you when the lights went out?

261
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:00.743
Well. yes.

262
00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:04.664
When the darkness fell.
I saw something strange.

263
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:08.918
like a-- like a scary monster right there.

264
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:10.670
CHILLY: <i>A scary monster?</i>

265
00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:12.380
<i>I can't look!</i>

266
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.299
No monsters here.

267
00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:20.221
Maybe in the dark.
that chair looks different.

268
00:11:20.304 --> 00:11:23.057
Will you be okay if we turn out
the lights for just a second?

269
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.558
If you must.

270
00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.477
I'll hold your hand. Sir Kirby.

271
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.521
Then you won't be so scared!

272
00:11:28.604 --> 00:11:30.314
Ah. m'lady.

273
00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:35.277
One. two. three...

274
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:36.737
(tense music playing)

275
00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:38.072
(panting)

276
00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:39.156
The monster!

277
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.366
I see it!

278
00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:42.451
Right there!

279
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.995
DOC: No. Look. It's not a monster!

280
00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:47.832
It's just the way the chair
and the jacket look when it's dark.

281
00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:51.168
(gasps) By Jove. you're right!

282
00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.338
Remember that time
you thought you saw a bear in the dark?

283
00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:55.589
When we turned on the light.

284
00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:58.342
it was just a pile of dirty clothes.

285
00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:00.803
Which is why
you should clean up your room!

286
00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.263
Dad!

cake. and games we had.

321

What if we give her
a surprise birthday party!

349
00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:58.647
(whispers)
But we have to keep it a secret.

350
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.733
(whispers) Okay! Shhh!

351
00:15:00.816 --> 00:15:03.068

Does anyone remember

353
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.239
when Doc threw a surprise party
for Hallie?

354
00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:08.574
I do!

355
00:15:08.657 --> 00:15:11.368
Doc and her friends
were trying to decorate the clinic...

356
00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:13.829
But they had to keep it
a secret from Hallie!

357
00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.707
If I know that hippo. and I do.

358
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.168
I know there's two things she likes.

359
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.295
parties and surprises.

360
00:15:21.378 --> 00:15:23.339
