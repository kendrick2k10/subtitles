364
00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:05.022
None of them were connected to
Russia in an official capacity.

365
00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:06.565

was dealing weapons

366
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:08.818
out of Aleppo when we went in?

367

Oh. we had a feeling.

368
00:26:13.614 --> 00:26:16.450
We’re a man short.

369
00:26:16.534 --> 00:26:19.287
Kelly said one of
the Russians got away.

370
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.330
There’s three men here.
Where’s the fourth?

371
00:26:21.414 --> 00:26:23.332
Uh. it doesn’t matter.

372
00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:27.628
The CIA’s position on this
moving forward

373
00:26:27.712 --> 00:26:29.338
is that the matter is closed.

374
00:26:29.422 --> 00:26:31.507
What?

375
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:34.635
The director considers
the score even.

376

377
00:26:37.054 --> 00:26:39.473
it’s unnecessary
to poke the bear any further.

If Sarah believes
there’s not enough intel

380
00:26:48.482 --> 00:26:51.110
for me to generate a response.
my hands are tied.

381
00:26:51.193 --> 00:26:53.195

00:27:00.494 --> 00:27:02.496

00:27:51.629 --> 00:27:53.839

391
00:27:58.135 --> 00:28:00.805

any further investigation

Don’t get much more death
around you than that.

-John.
-No. no.

720

You’re not responsible
for any of that.

This isn’t a revenge mission.

726
00:51:17.325 --> 00:51:19.327
This is an extraction.

727
00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:24.540
We are going to
bring him to justice.

If you do not. your intentions

754
00:52:40.449 --> 00:52:42.368
will be considered hostile
to Russian Federation.

755
00:52:42.451 --> 00:52:44.245
