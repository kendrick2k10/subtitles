00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.635
- This morning.
Free Solo's Alex Honnold.

4
00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:15.015
climbing in an unexplored rock formation
deep in the Amazon known as "tepui."

5
00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.145
And... and I worked with the team on this.

6
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:23.273
and have followed their journey.
They brought along scientist Bruce Means.

7
00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.901
who believes these tepuis
are teeming with biodiversity.

8
00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:30.822
He likened it to a hidden Galapagos.
full of undiscovered species.

9
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.615
and wants to see them protected.

10
00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:39.581
- All these tepuis. almost every one.
has sometimes up to 1000-foot-tall

11
00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.332
fringing summit cliffs.

12
00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:45.211
And none of those have been
explored for new species.

13
00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:58.641
- I think most people
are pretty surprised when they find out

14
00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:03.104
that there are crazy towers
out in the jungle.

15
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.027
It's like this mythical place. you know.

16
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.157
where there's stuff that's wilder
than anything that you could make up.

17
00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.910
and it really exists.

18
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.004
- Doing first ascents. I mean.
it really is modern exploration.

19
00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.215
because you are going onto. you know.

20
00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:32.342
in this case. a piece of rock
that no human has ever touched.

21
00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.345
And so. you really don't know
what you're gonna find.

22
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.315
You have to rein in the fear.
rein in the uncertainty.

23
00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:51.528
and then just remain calm
as you literally step into the unknown.

24
00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:29.899
- We're on an expedition

25
00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:34.154
into the glorious heart of South America.
the tepuis.

26
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.991
- I've been here with Bruce before.

27
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:45.456
The last time I was here was...
was 2006. So. it's been 15 years.

28
00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:48.459
and I've been trying
to get back ever since.

29
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.305
- When Bruce and I
did our first expedition here.

30
00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:04.142
I witnessed this passion
that he had for science.

31
00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:13.484
I know on one of the trips.
I think he found nine new species.

32
00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.242
And I was like. "Oh. Holy..."
Like this... this... what he's doing.

33
00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:25.538
he's basically on a one-man mission
to save this entire area...

34
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:31.336
by finding and cataloging
enough new species to prove to the world

35
00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:34.505
that it's this unrivaled
biodiversity hotspot

36
00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.090
that must be protected.

37
00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:40.136
But he's nearly 80 years old now.

38
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.515
And there's one final place
he has never been able to get to

39
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.267
to complete his work.

40
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.605
High on the cliff walls themselves.

41
00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:57.946
-So. I called Alex Honnold.

42
00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.825
- Alex is one of the boldest.

43
00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.536
if not the single boldest climber
in the world.

44
00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:12.752
I told him what we were gonna try to do.
And Alex loved the idea

45
00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:17.757
of getting Bruce up the cliff.
and Alex is a can-do kind of guy.

46
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.134
And he wants to make it happen.

47
00:04:21.552 --> 00:04:23.846
- A trip like this
with a renowned biologist.

48
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.890
with a great team. with a cool objective.

49
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:28.268
I mean. it's not the kind of thing
that comes along all the time.

50
00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.645
It's something that I've always wanted
to do in my life.

51
00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:34.983
My role on the trip is to make sure
that we successfully climb the wall.

52
00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:38.319
And I think that. you know.
particularly with an 80-year-old man.

53
00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.405
I mean...
...we're gonna be pretty careful about it.

54
00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.740
But I think it'll be really scary.

55
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.159
-- Four thousand feet.

56
00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:50.498
I had us veering off down at 3.750.
which is the closest to the wall. or...

57
00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:52.500
- But that's. like. 2.000 feet
of vertical. huh?

58
00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.711
-Bruce. is that adequate for you?
-- Oh. yeah. Yeah.

59
00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:56.212
I should be able to get specimens.

60
00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.299
They have to be in museums
to document that you found them.

61
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.467
and I need to get a little DNA from them.

62
00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:05.638
And then don't you think.
they have to deal also with a small area?

63
00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:06.806
-- Yeah.
-- Small.

64
00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.684
-If we can just get you to the top...
-- Yeah. Then we'll know.

65
00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:13.271
...and. uh. you can do the full survey.

66
00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.567
The very best-case scenario
would be that the wall is steep enough

67
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.320
that the rope basically
hangs freely down in a plumb line.

68
00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:23.239
And then we basically haul him
the way that you would haul a bag. like...

69
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.199
he would basically just be sitting
on a little chair.

70
00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.661
just slowly levitating up the wall.
enjoying the view. looking for species.

71
00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:31.831
Okay. but what if...
what if it's not overhanging?

72
00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:33.875
Then we'll have to do some improvising.

73
00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.918
Thankfully. you brought a climber
with you. and we'll sort it out.

74
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.795
-you know?
-Yeah. well. I have Honnold to take.

75
00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.505
But the problem is that Honnold.

76
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.508
even though he's all gung ho.
he can't haul Bruce himself.

77
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.719
-No. no. but that's why we have a team.
-He's gonna need some help.

78
00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.763
-Yeah. that's probably true.

79
00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:52.268
- Our climbing objective
is deep in the Amazon jungle.

80
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.152
This is what the view looks like ahead.

81
00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.073
Thirty-five miles of jungle trekking.

82
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.128
Well done. Bruce. cruising.

83
00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.341
Being with Bruce in the jungle
is an incredible way to appreciate

84
00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:25.301
the diversity of life around.

85
00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.387
I mean. he just knows
the backstory of everything.

86
00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.723
Oh. Look! Right there. Isn't that cool?

87
00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.851
It's like going to a party
with someone who knows everyone.

88
00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.396
He's like. "That guy used to date
that girl. and then they hung out.

89
00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.439
"and then that person..."
You know. he knows all the relationships.

90
00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:41.526
And I think that as you appreciate
the complex web of relationships

91
00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:44.195
in the jungle more.
it makes it much more engaging.

92
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.615
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Something good. y'all.

93
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:52.078
Spiders are predacious.
and they usually eat each other.

94
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:53.663
so they're usually solitary.

95
00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:58.418
But there are some that are colonial.
And this is one of them.

96
00:06:59.043 --> 00:07:01.087
That is cool. Wow.

97
00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:06.968
His passion for nature
is so inspiring to me.

98
00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:10.430
Inspiring... not only as a biologist.

99
00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:15.143
but as a person. And I'm honored
to be in an expedition with him.

100
00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:20.731
- This expedition
is. uh. sort of the culmination

101
00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:22.733
of all my work in South America.

102
00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:30.283
This all started. you know. as a child
when I began to appreciate nature

103
00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:32.535
and wonder
about the meaning of everything.

104
00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:37.123
And I soon became fascinated
by nine or ten years old with evolution.

105
00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:42.587
So. I caught lizards. and snakes.
and tarantulas. and scorpions.

106
00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.005
Kept them in jars.

107
00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:48.176
Oh. This is cool.
You see the little yellow tail tip?

108
00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:49.635
He's coming up.

109
00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.597
And ultimately. it led me
to this wonderful region...

110
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.807
-No. no. don't jump.
-...and then fell in love with tepuis.

111
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.476
Don't jump off. There we go.

112
00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:03.733
- Tepuis are sort
of islands in the sky.

113
00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:09.947
They were probably eroded
into the sandstone from Africa

114
00:08:10.364 --> 00:08:12.658
when South America
and Africa were connected

115
00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.619
millions and millions of years ago.

116
00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:23.753
This expedition's the first expedition
to attempt to look at the walls of tepuis

117
00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:28.591
to see whether there are unique flora
and fauna growing on those walls.

118
00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:36.474
Hopefully. by assessing
the species' richness

119
00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:40.895
of this particular area.
may compel government leaders

120
00:08:40.978 --> 00:08:42.188
and the people of Guyana

121
00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:46.776
to want to conserve
this fabulous. beautiful place.

122
00:08:47.735 --> 00:08:49.570
- This is his dream come true.

123
00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:53.741
This... this trip. you know.
could be kind of his magnum opus.

124
00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:58.829
- That is cool. Wow.

125
00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:02.625
- He's been on. uh.

126
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.546
33 tepui expeditions.
He's never been on the cliff.

127
00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:12.593
And so. that's what we're here to do.
is to take Bruce on a journey

128
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.973
up to the top of the tepui itself
to look for new species.

129
00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:22.270
and to catalog. you know.
what exists in this really. you know.

130
00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:26.357
unique place in the world
that scientists haven't really explored.

131
00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:41.205
- Hey. Troy. how's the weather today?

132
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.838
-- It's uh. we...
-Yeah. Yeah.

133
00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.215
-Yeah.
-- No problem?

134
00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:58.264
- Hiking through the jungle
to approach the tepuis

135
00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:00.683
is sort of an interesting experience.
'cause you start in the rainforest.

136
00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:04.854
which is technical hiking. you know.
stepping over roots. crossing streams.

137
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.232
And then each day
gets progressively harder and harder

138
00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:11.652
as you get closer to the tepuis.
closer to the. uh. actual big walls.

139
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:14.989
because the terrain gets steeper
and more vegetating.

140
00:10:15.072 --> 00:10:17.617
You know. it just steadily builds on you
the whole way.

141
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.118
You're like.
"Oh. It just keeps getting worse."

142
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:20.411
"It keeps getting worse!"

143
00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:25.458
- It's a war of attrition
against the mud and saturation

144
00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:29.045
when you're in these forests.
So. it's hard.

145
00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.798
Getting a little tiring now.

146
00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:35.926
I think I've been doing this today...

147
00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:39.055
...almost six hours.

148
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.768
- I'm a little concerned about Bruce.

149
00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:48.022
Because the terrain is getting steeper
and more complicated.

150
00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:55.321
Bruce is. you know. just moving
more slowly than we all anticipated.

151
00:10:55.404 --> 00:10:58.115
With more difficulty.
I think even he's. like. surprised

152
00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.992
at how hard he's getting his butt kicked.

153
00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.204
-Okay there. Bruce?

154
00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.581
-I'm all right.
-You okay?

155
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.083
-Yeah.
-Okay.

156
00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:10.461
It's hard. you know. not to worry

157
00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:12.171
whether we're gonna be able
to pull this off.

158
00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:16.425
Keep on trucking!

159
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:20.680
-Only four more days to Double Drop.
-- Yeah.

160
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:24.850
- Then we get to the gnarly part.

161
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.501
Careful. take it slow.

162
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.593
Oh. This is gonna be so treacherous
for Bruce.

163
00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:06.434
He just got to the steepest part.
So he's putting on a harness.

164
00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:08.352
and Mark is gonna maybe put him on belay.

165
00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:12.106
It's like. in a way. it's kind of easy.

166
00:12:12.356 --> 00:12:15.860
but in a way. it's... if you fell.
you would possibly die. so...

167
00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:21.198
- The Akawaios
built this rickety ladder.

168
00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.493
- Going one at a time.

169
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:25.995
- Yeah. they're big steps.

170
00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:27.371
- Yeah. I see that.

171
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:34.253
That's a problem for me.
is. uh... is bending my knees.

172
00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:36.714
Yes. I can see what I'm doing.

173
00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:42.720
Let's see here.

174
00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:45.347
- Awesome. Bruce.

175
00:12:46.223 --> 00:12:47.224
We're almost there.

176
00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.310
You're a trooper.

177
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.272
- Hey.

178
00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.399
Dude. that was an...
that was an incredible effort.

179
00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.109
-Now. you just gotta slip and slide...
-We made it.

180
00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.736
...through the mud
for about ten more minutes.

181
00:12:58.819 --> 00:12:59.862
Oh. mud I can do.

182
00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:07.077
- There's a bit of misery
and there's some suffering.

183
00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:15.044
but the payout. it's stuff that completely
blows your mind.

184
00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:40.569
-Oh. I love it!

185
00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:43.030
I can't wait
to get in that water.

186
00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:45.282
-- Welcome to Double Drop!
-Hot dog.

187
00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:58.003
- That was a...
a really big moment for Bruce.

188
00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:01.465
I know it's one of his favorite places
on Earth.

189
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.968
And I know it was part of his dream
just to get there.

190
00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.349
- This is my Shangri-la!

191
00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:12.268
It's...

192
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.105
the most wild. pristine...

193
00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:21.485
remote. beautiful place
I've been on the planet.

194
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.446
I can't believe I was able to return...

195
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:26.615
one last time.

196
00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:36.542
- It was an awesome moment.
but at the same time.

197
00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:41.046
we were getting deeper and deeper
into the middle of nowhere.

198
00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:45.968
and getting. you know.
committed to a scary degree.

199
00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.722
I was looking
at the approach and thinking.

200
00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:54.101
"How in the world are we gonna get
Bruce through this terrain?"

201
00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:57.021
Oh. my God.

202
00:14:58.772 --> 00:14:59.815
- Mark. what have we got?

203
00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:02.026
- There's Wei-Assipu.

204
00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:08.407
- That looks... gnarly.

205
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.870
-Like. climbing that is not gonna be easy.

206
00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:16.290
Especially not bringing
an 80-year-old up it.

207
00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:35.351
All the porters are helping Bruce

208
00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:40.147
to get all the frogs.
lizards. snakes. spiders.

209
00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:44.985
-Uh. It's madness in camp.

210
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.573
- Oh. You got a big tarantula.

211
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.910
The goliath spider. the largest spider
in the world.

212
00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:57.206
In this particular part of the world.

213
00:15:57.456 --> 00:16:02.378
the original inventory of the animals
and plants here has not been completed.

214
00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:05.798
-This snake eats snails.

215
00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:12.096
And now. we're starting to find
that as we discover more and more species.

216
00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:16.058
it's becoming a more and more important
biodiversity hotspot.

217
00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:19.520
The final piece of the puzzle

218
00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:22.481
is discovering what lives
up on the tepui walls.

219
00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:26.694
It's such an extreme place to get to.

220
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:29.738
Scientists have simply
not been able to explore it.

221
00:16:34.868 --> 00:16:37.579
- So. I've been promising Bruce
that he's gonna get up the wall.

222
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.624
but I don't really know
how it's going to happen yet.

223
00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:42.835
I mean. it's probably gonna involve

224
00:16:42.918 --> 00:16:46.213
some hybrid combination of techniques
and strategies. But at this point.

225
00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:48.590
the challenge is trekking
through the jungle as an 80-year-old.

226
00:16:55.973 --> 00:17:01.270
After we saw how bad Bruce got beaten up.
Alex. Fuco. and I

227
00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:03.605
were already like. "Wow."

228
00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:07.359
-- And it became apparent

229
00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:12.656
that it was going to take him
a lot longer than we had anticipated

230
00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:15.117
to get to the base of the wall.

231
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:22.374
What we're going to do. I think
is we're going to halve the distance

232
00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:26.211
that we were going
to be covering each day.

233
00:17:27.087 --> 00:17:31.216
So. that does mean that the approach
is gonna take twice as long.

234
00:17:31.508 --> 00:17:33.927
But. no. it means that Bruce
can do half the distance.

235
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.346
but maybe we still do full distance
for some of it

236
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.931
to make sure that the weight
of the wall...

237
00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:39.683
I mean.
we can divide and conquer a little bit.

238
00:17:39.808 --> 00:17:41.643
Yeah. we have to... we have to...

239
00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:42.978
That's what we should talk
about at dinner.

240
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:45.105
-Yes. I guess. Yeah.
-'Cause there's definitely a world

241
00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:50.235
in which the gear and the climbing team
sticks to the same schedule.

242
00:17:50.527 --> 00:17:53.906
Bruce takes whatever pace he needs.
and it all works out fine.

243
00:17:56.492 --> 00:18:02.498
My biggest fear would be that my age
and my physical ability might deter

244
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:07.169
or might somehow slow up the expedition.
That bothers me. worries me a lot.

245
00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:16.053
The one thing that we could do is.
we move forward

246
00:18:16.553 --> 00:18:20.349
with the porters. you know.
with the line cutters.

247
00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:22.851
And we blaze the trail

248
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.562
to the base of the cliff
while Bruce stays and does his stuff

249
00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:26.647
-at Double Drop.
-- Hmm.

250
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.984
Then the trail is in.
and then either we double back.

251
00:18:31.151 --> 00:18:33.695
maybe to spend some time with him.

252
00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:36.198
-or we just start working on the climb.
-- But...

253
00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:38.158
-And he's catching up.
-- It makes sense.

254
00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:43.664
I think half-camps make sense. at least
for. you know. the majority of the team.

255
00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:45.666
Um. you know.
'cause safety I think is the...

256
00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:47.209
-- For sure.
-...really has to be a priority.

257
00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:51.130
- I'm for whatever you guys
wanna do. I'm not pushing for anything.

258
00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:55.300
I mean. I'm okay
with doing a little. single thing.

259
00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:57.594
'cause I like to be out a little.
out in the woods all alone.

260
00:18:57.678 --> 00:19:01.473
and I've done that for years and years.
But I'm 80. almost 80. you know?

261
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:05.435
Yesterday. I had several
potential bone-breaking falls.

262
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.523
-And...
-We need to reduce that down to nil.

263
00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:11.692
-- Yeah. Yeah.
-And that's...

264
00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:13.777
It seems like we all agree
that we're gonna split legs.

265
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:15.445
you're gonna pace yourself.
It's gonna be great.

266
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:17.197
-- That's it.
-- So. we have a plan

267
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.282
for the next couple of days.

268
00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:19.950
-- Cool. Let's go to bed.
-- Sure.

269
00:19:20.033 --> 00:19:21.243
-Yep.
-You gotta get to sleep.

270
00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:22.578
We have another big day tomorrow.

271
00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:24.288
-Okay.
-Let's wrap it up.

272
00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:32.796
- The kind of research I do.
you could call it alpha level science.

273
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.842
I'm going out in nature. and I'm looking
to see what I can find there.

274
00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.887
It'll be a real delightful surprise

275
00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.557
if we were to find something
new to science on a cliff.

276
00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:47.019
I mean. I couldn't ask for better
than Mark and Alex Honnold

277
00:19:47.227 --> 00:19:48.979
to try to get me up that wall.

278
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:01.200
-See you. boys.

279
00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:02.868
-- All right.
-All right. we'll see you up there.

280
00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.204
-- Oh. yeah. Here we go.
-- Today's the day

281
00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:09.666
when we are hopefully
getting to the wall. at long last.

282
00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:12.502
Total unknown.
No one has ever been up there.

283
00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:16.381
Today's a really big. important day
for the expedition.

284
00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:23.555
The Amerindians
are specialists of the jungle.

285
00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.850
- They're just good at moving through
the terrain.

286
00:20:26.934 --> 00:20:30.145
And then at the other end of the spectrum.
you have our whole team.

287
00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:31.980
and we don't even know
how to hike through the jungle.

288
00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:34.733
I can't orienteer in the jungle at all.
I don't know where we're going.

289
00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:44.493
They've got a plan and let's
just let them. uh. execute their vision.

290
00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:53.168
You guys see that orange wall right there?

291
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.253
Yeah.

292
00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:55.420
-On the left.
-On the left.

293
00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:56.838
-Yeah.
-- That's where we're trying to get.

294
00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:57.923
- Okay.

295
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.684
-You guys wanna see the ridge?

296
00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:16.525
-- Look at that thing go!
-- Goodbye. drone.

297
00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.279
- We saw the wall from the trail.

298
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.991
and we started planning
where we could climb.

299
00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.244
Think I can go lower. too.

300
00:21:30.914 --> 00:21:33.208
Yeah. this is...
this is the ridge wood turning around.

301
00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:34.418
-- Mm-hmm.
-And it's over this side.

302
00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:37.170
to the right side.
it's straight down and over the side.

303
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.924
- Better to cut down
and cut more in front of Bruce.

304
00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:42.217
- It's fricking tall. dude.

305
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:46.179
Well. look at all the veg
along to the right of the orange face.

306
00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:48.348
-You see that with the sun now?
-- Well. see... that's the shelf

307
00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:51.184
that we were talking about.
Maybe there's a traverse.

308
00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:53.312
-You could just sort of see it.
-- Yeah.

309
00:21:54.187 --> 00:21:58.942
- When we saw the features
that we were trying to recognize.

310
00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:01.862
we pretty much knew where to go.

311
00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:08.118
-Success!

312
00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:12.831
- You look out to the distance
and it's like a whole little island.

313
00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:15.417
but getting to the wall
is actually incredibly complicated.

314
00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:22.174
- It's like if you imagine just
the thickest. like. deep. deep.

315
00:22:22.257 --> 00:22:23.800
like. peat moss or something.

316
00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:27.262
- Watch out for holes.

317
00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:37.856
You're balancing
on this skinny little log.

318
00:22:37.939 --> 00:22:41.401
and if you slip on this. you're falling
down into this deep crevasse.

319
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.654
I don't know
how we're gonna get Bruce up through this.

320
00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:46.531
- It's pretty crazy right there.

321
00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:48.867
-- Just simply the most treacherous...

322
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.827
...stuff that I've ever had
to move through.

323
00:22:57.793 --> 00:23:00.170
-- So. this will require more...

324
00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:04.633
more than a chainsaw for making it
easy for Bruce.

325
00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:07.177
-Or a helicopter.
-- Yeah.

326
00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.770
- All of a sudden.
the jungle opens up.

327
00:23:16.853 --> 00:23:19.147
and this wall of rock appears.

328
00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:22.567
Holy...

329
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.584
-Dude. this is so sick!
-- This is insane.

330
00:23:41.128 --> 00:23:42.754
- It was crazy. It was crazy.

331
00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:45.382
but. uh. here we are. deep in the jungle.
so. I guess.

332
00:23:45.465 --> 00:23:47.426
at this point. I guess.
we're actually gonna climb the wall.

333
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:18.290
After what we just went through today.
it's kind of impossible for me to...

334
00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:21.585
to picture Bruce coming up that.

335
00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:27.382
That was beyond anything
that I've ever done.

336
00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:30.594
So. yeah. So. that's a problem.

337
00:24:50.113 --> 00:24:53.033
Oh. my gosh!

338
00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:05.253
Well. this definitely.
today... was. uh...

339
00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:09.049
...right up there
with the most strenuous day

340
00:25:09.132 --> 00:25:10.759
because I was going uphill all day.

341
00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:14.721
Yeah. I'm worried. Bruce.
It's my gut feeling that...

342
00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:17.933
if we push on. we're risking your life.

343
00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:20.227
Oh. boy.

344
00:25:22.479 --> 00:25:27.234
Can we wait to see what Mark says?

345
00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:30.612
Absolutely. you know. I think
this will need to be a team decision.

346
00:25:30.695 --> 00:25:33.949
-But my opinion is that...
-Well. yours is...

347
00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:35.367
-That this is...
-...you're the medical one.

348
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.910
...not worth risking your life for.

349
00:25:36.993 --> 00:25:38.286
-And that we're really...

350
00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:40.747
...going into a territory that...

351
00:25:41.748 --> 00:25:43.625
has hazards that we can't mitigate.

352
00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:50.131
- Mark. Mark.

353
00:25:50.465 --> 00:25:54.511
Hey. Bruce. great to hear your voice. man.
How you doing? You sound a little beat.

354
00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:56.680
- I need to hear from you. but.

355
00:25:56.888 --> 00:26:00.016
let's see what your point of view is
about me coming up there. Over.

356
00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:06.690
Yeah. so. the terrain. um.
in between us and you

357
00:26:07.148 --> 00:26:12.654
is... is just way too.
too serious. and. um...

358
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:15.949
...too dangerous really. I think...

359
00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:19.661
for... for us to feel good
about you moving up through it.

360
00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:22.122
We're just worried. you know.
that... that... that you get hurt.

361
00:26:22.205 --> 00:26:25.917
There'd be no real way
for us to evacuate you. Over.

362
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.964
- I understand.
I'm not happy about it.

363
00:26:31.047 --> 00:26:34.092
but the. uh. success of the expedition

364
00:26:34.175 --> 00:26:37.887
depends on me and everybody else
not getting terribly injured.

365
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:42.225
You guys can continue
the elevational transect.

366
00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:45.228
So. anything you guys obtain.
and Fuco especially.

367
00:26:45.353 --> 00:26:49.649
who knows the herpetofauna pretty well.
if you can grab it and bag it for me.

368
00:26:49.733 --> 00:26:51.276
And when you get back down here.

369
00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.862
we will have completed
the entire transect.

370
00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:59.284
I will send a drawing
of a species of Stefania up there

371
00:26:59.826 --> 00:27:03.038
that is new to science.
and you're very likely to get.

372
00:27:03.663 --> 00:27:06.541
So. anything and everything
that you guys do

373
00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:09.586
while you're on the wall and on the summit

374
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:14.424
will benefit our expedition greatly.
even if I'm not up there myself.

375
00:27:15.008 --> 00:27:19.638
Okay. Bruce. I'm gonna do my best
to try to find the... the lucky Stefania.

376
00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:23.558
- Fantastic. Fuco.
I know if anybody can do it. it'll be you.

377
00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:24.976
Over and out.

378
00:27:26.936 --> 00:27:30.940
I've already found several new species
of frogs in the genus Stefania

379
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:32.817
at the base of the tepui.

380
00:27:33.193 --> 00:27:37.113
My theory is that we should discover
a new species of Stefania

381
00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:40.241
that evolved on the top of the tepui.

382
00:27:42.285 --> 00:27:46.206
I...
...felt like I was letting the team down.

383
00:27:47.374 --> 00:27:51.503
Because I wanted to do it myself.
but I respected their...

384
00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:54.506
their advice.

385
00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.011
Hopefully. to the likelihood
of me getting home alive.

386
00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:18.446
Oh. my God. Holy...

387
00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:23.076
The clouds just lifted out
for the first time in forever.

388
00:28:23.576 --> 00:28:25.954
Rainbow! Rainbow!

389
00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:28.790
-Rainbow! Rainbow!

390
00:28:31.459 --> 00:28:33.420
God. this kinda makes it all worthwhile.

391
00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:38.133
-- You pumped to see some blue?
-Best view so far.

392
00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:39.676
- Rainbows!

393
00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:46.683
This is absolutely breathtaking.

394
00:28:47.308 --> 00:28:51.396
The most dramatic scene I... I think
I've ever witnessed in the mountains.

395
00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:04.409
Packing for the wall.
We're finally launching.

396
00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:11.958
-Fuco. that just came up with the porters.
-Let me take a look.

397
00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:15.128
Is that... Oh. that's the sketch
for the frog we're looking for?

398
00:29:15.378 --> 00:29:16.379
Yep.

399
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:19.507
-Oh. wow.
-- Wow. that's so cool.

400
00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:23.678
This is the frog that Bruce wants us
to look for up on the wall.

401
00:29:23.803 --> 00:29:26.639
-- Mm-hmm.
-- New species of Stefania...

402
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:28.725
-Sounds like a...
-...from the summit of Wei-Assipu.

403
00:29:29.726 --> 00:29:34.939
I do have some degree of expertise
in... in the field of biology.

404
00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:41.696
So. I feel the responsibility...
to be an eye for Bruce on the wall.

405
00:29:44.073 --> 00:29:45.700
We're gonna start the route.

406
00:29:48.077 --> 00:29:49.454
Time to don the helmet.

407
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:55.543
Harness on.
Get racked up. Yeah. it's awesome.

408
00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.172
- Okay. Climbing.

409
00:30:00.048 --> 00:30:01.090
- On the way.

410
00:30:03.009 --> 00:30:04.594
- This cliff has never been climbed.

411
00:30:05.762 --> 00:30:09.307
So. the plan is to work our way
up the rock. and find the route as we go.

412
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:14.521
After about 800 feet. there's a ledge
where we can hopefully set up camp.

413
00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:19.359
From there. we'll traverse the ledge
all the way to the summit plateau.

414
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:22.529
searching for frogs and other creatures
all along the way.

415
00:30:26.616 --> 00:30:29.911
- A little bit higher up.
there's a nice horizontal crack

416
00:30:29.994 --> 00:30:31.830
where you might just get a bomber pin.

417
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:35.875
Let me know if you've come across
anything sketchy.

418
00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:40.547
- Yep. This is actually
a little sketchy.

419
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:41.756
-- Okay.

420
00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:48.096
-This is all loose here.
-- Yeah. It seems like it.

421
00:30:56.896 --> 00:30:59.315
- Yeah. It's crazy. like.
how the rock is both. like.

422
00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:01.067
so bad and so good in some ways.

423
00:31:02.318 --> 00:31:03.444
- You have to be careful.

424
00:31:05.321 --> 00:31:09.492
- On a... on a first ascent.
there's going to be loose rocks.

425
00:31:12.245 --> 00:31:13.997
- A lot of stuff like that going on.
you know?

426
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:18.626
- That's probably the biggest hazard
that you face when you're. you know.

427
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.461
pioneering a new route.

428
00:31:21.004 --> 00:31:22.797
I mean. we're talking things
that can be huge.

429
00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:25.174
like pieces of rock
the size of a school bus.

430
00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:27.594
You know. something like that comes off

431
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:30.305
when you're climbing
could definitely kill you.

432
00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:34.851
Just don't know what you can trust.

433
00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:41.316
-Watch me good. Fuco.
-- Yep. got you.

434
00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:47.614
- Okay!

435
00:31:54.203 --> 00:31:57.916
- Yeah.

436
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.085
-Yeah!

437
00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:06.007
-That's hard.
-- It was.

438
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:11.220
First patch. ...So cold. Whoo!

439
00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:14.599
Nice job!

440
00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:18.978
- Wow. So. did they say
where they're going up?

441
00:32:19.145 --> 00:32:21.064
Right... right up the middle there.
I guess.

442
00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:26.402
I've seen this scene
from the air in satellite photos.

443
00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:29.030
But to actually be here

444
00:32:29.572 --> 00:32:33.743
is more breathtaking
than any aerial shot could ever be.

445
00:32:34.494 --> 00:32:40.041
It's really exciting to me
that the cliff itself has ledges.

446
00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:42.001
and other places. cracks. and fissures

447
00:32:42.085 --> 00:32:45.546
where vegetation grows.
And those are very likely spots

448
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:49.384
where some of the animals
I'm interested in could live.

449
00:32:49.926 --> 00:32:54.681
And if Fuco. and Mark. and Alex
are able to find any animals on the cliff.

450
00:32:54.764 --> 00:33:00.103
like frogs or lizards.
it'll be a really great discovery.

451
00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:06.526
Nobody's ever... ever done any work
on the cliff. as you can see why.

452
00:33:11.447 --> 00:33:13.116
- As disappointed as I am

453
00:33:13.199 --> 00:33:16.244
that I won't be able to personally
continue the transect

454
00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:19.539
to the summit of Wei-Assipu.
I'm very happy

455
00:33:19.622 --> 00:33:23.167
that colleagues are doing that for me.

456
00:33:23.292 --> 00:33:28.006
And. uh. I'm going to be able
to spend a week in this paradise

457
00:33:28.089 --> 00:33:30.049
right here by myself.

458
00:33:30.466 --> 00:33:36.139
looking at all those amazing organisms
that occur in this site.

459
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:43.646
And here I am situated for maybe a week
to be able to go out at night and look at.

460
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.859
and study. and photograph.
uh. creatures I love.

461
00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:10.006
Our search zone extends
from my jungle camp

462
00:34:10.089 --> 00:34:11.591
to the top of the tepui.

463
00:34:13.843 --> 00:34:17.805
This entire area
is full of undiscovered species.

464
00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:22.518
And that little frog. right there.
I've never seen anything like it.

465
00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:27.982
So. here we got another new species.

466
00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:29.817
- It's so cool.

467
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.277
-- Yeah.
-- Congrats.

468
00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:33.696
- This will help add

469
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.408
to the biodiversity inventory
we're making of the area.

470
00:34:37.492 --> 00:34:41.287
and. uh. could aid
in its conservation ultimately.

471
00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:45.958
Pretty cool. A field biologist's dream.

472
00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:54.634
-- How does it look?
-- Pretty wild!

473
00:34:57.178 --> 00:35:00.181
- One of the most challenging things
in climbing. in general.

474
00:35:00.264 --> 00:35:02.016
is fear of the unknown.

475
00:35:02.225 --> 00:35:05.061
And basically.
keeping your mind under control

476
00:35:05.686 --> 00:35:08.106
as you encounter difficulties.

477
00:35:08.856 --> 00:35:12.276
And first ascents are basically
an amplified version of that experience.

478
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.488
because when you're doing a first ascent.
you really don't know what's there.

479
00:35:15.571 --> 00:35:17.990
could be anything above you.
It's like. who knows what's gonna happen?

480
00:35:20.993 --> 00:35:25.164
We are up here.
belaying Mark on what might wind up

481
00:35:25.248 --> 00:35:29.669
being one of the cruxes of this route.
He uh... he's leading this big roof.

482
00:35:33.422 --> 00:35:37.677
- A roof is an overhang
that juts out from the cliff face.

483
00:35:37.927 --> 00:35:43.224
This one is about 200 feet up the route.
and there's really no easy way around it.

484
00:35:46.936 --> 00:35:49.105
-Watch me.
-- Watching you.

485
00:35:57.029 --> 00:36:01.367
- The roof is really. uh.
not looking good.

486
00:36:02.076 --> 00:36:04.328
It's... it's... it's kind of extreme.

487
00:36:04.745 --> 00:36:07.373
I'm trying to think what you would do
if you were here.

488
00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:09.500
But I'm not really sure.

489
00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:12.044
Okay. well. you gotta do
what you think is best. but...

490
00:36:12.712 --> 00:36:16.465
Well. the main thing is where you think
you can penetrate the roof. you know?

491
00:36:16.716 --> 00:36:21.804
- There's a crack going out the roof.
but it's wicked thin.

492
00:36:21.888 --> 00:36:24.557
kind of like barely there.
and that's where we want to be.

493
00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.935
is over there. You should probably come up
and have a look.

494
00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:30.188
- Okay.
I mean. yeah. that's fine with me.

495
00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:34.066
- Alex took the rope.

496
00:36:34.317 --> 00:36:37.445
And then the next thing we know.
he's. like. just hanging...

497
00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:38.738
...like a sloth.

498
00:36:38.946 --> 00:36:41.532
And he just... We're like.
"Oh! I guess. he's going for it."

499
00:36:42.074 --> 00:36:43.743
- All right. Mark. Here we go.
This is the crux.

500
00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:45.411
- Okay. I got ya!

501
00:37:09.101 --> 00:37:10.895
-- Nice. Alex!
-- Yeah!

502
00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:36.963
- He just totally

503
00:37:37.171 --> 00:37:40.675
did one of the most impressive
pieces of climbing

504
00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:44.220
that I've ever seen actually
just on-site. first ascent.

505
00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:49.767
dangling out a roof
at a really high degree of difficulty.

506
00:37:51.352 --> 00:37:52.937
And it ended up being

507
00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:57.608
really. the key to the whole route.
getting out this giant roof.

508
00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.862
and. um. put us in the perfect position.
you know. to continue on from there.

509
00:38:03.155 --> 00:38:04.532
Yeah. dude. Nice work!

510
00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:14.625
Now. where the... do I go?

511
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.378
- Just because you have a rope
and equipment

512
00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:20.840
doesn't mean that you're actually safe.
You know. you are way out there.

513
00:38:20.923 --> 00:38:25.011
you are on a remote wall
in the far corners of Guyana.

514
00:38:25.428 --> 00:38:26.721
If you injure yourself. you know.

515
00:38:26.887 --> 00:38:28.973
there's no real way that you're going
to be rescued or helped.

516
00:38:29.932 --> 00:38:31.058
How is it down there. Fuco?

517
00:38:33.185 --> 00:38:35.604
- ...Whoa!

518
00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:46.532
-- Did something rip?

519
00:38:46.615 --> 00:38:48.451
- Did you pull gear out
or you just fall off?

520
00:38:48.951 --> 00:38:50.619
-- Just fell off.
-- Oh. yeah. Cool.

521
00:38:50.786 --> 00:38:55.583
- Feels slippery.
Whoo!

522
00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:58.044
- You have to make sure
that things are totally safe.

523
00:38:59.211 --> 00:39:01.964
This is a. you know.
a scary position to be climbing in.

524
00:39:02.798 --> 00:39:05.009
And you feel like it's a scene
from Cliffhanger or something.

525
00:39:08.763 --> 00:39:10.765
-- Yeah. Fuco!
-- Whoo!

526
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.142
-- Campeador.

527
00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:16.187
-- Wow. look at what Alex did.

528
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.564
- Can't believe
how overhanging this... is.

529
00:39:19.106 --> 00:39:20.649
-- You're like...
-Quite overhanging.

530
00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:22.610
...30 to 40 feet out from the wall.

531
00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:27.239
- From here.
it's still another 600 feet of sheer rock

532
00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:29.992
to reach a ledge
where we can set up camp for the night.

533
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:46.592
This expedition. unfortunately...
this is probably my last...

534
00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:48.761
trip involving...

535
00:39:49.678 --> 00:39:51.555
you know. jungle hiking.

536
00:39:52.098 --> 00:39:53.724
I like to walk along...

537
00:39:54.934 --> 00:39:58.312
slowly... uh. looking at the moss.

538
00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:01.857
looking... I'll find an insect. I'll see
an animal I wouldn't have seen

539
00:40:01.941 --> 00:40:03.609
if I was cruising along fast.

540
00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:06.904
And sure enough. just a minute ago.
this little guy hopped up.

541
00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:12.701
It's a toad.
Toads are frogs. not all frogs are toads.

542
00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:17.623
What's not to love?

543
00:40:24.672 --> 00:40:27.675
This is as pristine as it gets.

544
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:33.222
Uh. only our feet have been here
that I'm aware of. It's wild. and remote.

545
00:40:33.305 --> 00:40:35.683
and beautiful can... as can be.

546
00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:41.105
I just
wanna be quiet and love it.

547
00:40:42.356 --> 00:40:43.566
Let it sink in.

548
00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:51.323
I'll be leaving the planet...

549
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.619
...sometime.

550
00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.206
And I'll miss it.

551
00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:26.233
I'm about to head into the unknown here.
We're a bit in a cloud.

552
00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:28.194
so everything's a little wet.
which is unfortunate.

553
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.237
and makes it obviously a little harder
for climbing.

554
00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:31.447
because all the holds are wet.

555
00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:35.034
But. um. we're just gonna keep going.
and see how things play out.

556
00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:42.666
That was. like. the hardest crimp today.

557
00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:55.888
- Nice. Alex!

558
00:41:56.597 --> 00:42:00.601
- Yep. Wanna make sure that it feels
like a pleasure cruise up here.

559
00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.821
-Fuco and I at the belay here.

560
00:42:13.155 --> 00:42:15.866
Fuco's belaying Mark. who... let's see.
Can we see him below here?

561
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.159
Oh. yeah. there he is.

562
00:42:17.243 --> 00:42:19.578
He's still climbing up
out of the crazy clouds.

563
00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:22.122
I guess. this is why they call it
a cloud forest.

564
00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:24.124
The wall above us looks...

565
00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:27.294
Well. we'll just see.
It looks very interesting.

566
00:42:31.757 --> 00:42:35.177
- Oh. my God.
It's full-on. literally Jenga.

567
00:42:36.178 --> 00:42:37.304
Rock!

568
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:41.392
Rock!

569
00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:46.522
Rock!

570
00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:55.364
-It's a little scary. Fuco.
-- Yeah. I know.

571
00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:59.493
There was this lip that I had to turn
to get up to the ledge.

572
00:42:59.702 --> 00:43:03.706
and almost every single hold
was removable.

573
00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:08.836
And the thing that was so challenging
and scary for me

574
00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:11.171
was that I had to remove it all
without falling off.

575
00:43:13.882 --> 00:43:15.801
Okay. Fuco. I'm questing on.

576
00:43:32.067 --> 00:43:35.237
Whoo! ...Yeah!

577
00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:42.202
This is the exit to my pitch.

578
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.038
-- What's up?
-- That was scary.

579
00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:48.167
All right. We... did it.
We're on the ledge.

580
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.546
One. two. three! Pull.

581
00:43:53.839 --> 00:43:54.882
- Okay. underneath that.

582
00:43:55.758 --> 00:43:56.759
Three!

583
00:43:56.842 --> 00:44:00.929
- It's getting dark on us.
and we're still hauling giant bags.

584
00:44:02.097 --> 00:44:05.267
-It's so much stuff.
-One. two. three!

585
00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:08.854
Now. it's going to get interesting
from the biology perspective

586
00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:11.690
because I'm be...
I'm gonna be looking for frogs.

587
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.408
- We're erecting our wall camp.

588
00:44:21.742 --> 00:44:25.162
Basically. we're just trying to settle
into our new home.

589
00:44:25.537 --> 00:44:27.247
up toward the top of the cliff.

590
00:44:28.123 --> 00:44:32.002
So. the plan for tomorrow.
we're gonna quest off in this traverse.

591
00:44:32.086 --> 00:44:35.422
across this thing.
and try to get to the summit.

592
00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:39.635
and it's... I guarantee
that it's gonna be a... a wild adventure.

593
00:44:40.052 --> 00:44:42.304
Ex... exploration.
that's what it's gonna be tomorrow.

594
00:44:42.388 --> 00:44:47.142
Exploration in the name of science.
On behalf of Dr. Bruce Means.

595
00:44:47.434 --> 00:44:50.312
we've gotta try to find the frog.
It's not gonna be easy.

596
00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:09.790
- We've been checking in
from the expedition with Michael Strahan

597
00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:11.125
from Good Morning America.

598
00:45:11.792 --> 00:45:13.293
Giving updates via satphone

599
00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:15.587
of the progress of the expedition
and what we're doing.

600
00:45:15.754 --> 00:45:18.215
It's pretty cool to be able
to share this experience

601
00:45:18.298 --> 00:45:20.259
with the world as it happens.

602
00:45:20.843 --> 00:45:24.596
- Hey. Alex. How you doing. man?
How is it going out there?

603
00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:30.185
Hey. it's going great. We've successfully
climbed a portion of this giant tepui.

604
00:45:30.269 --> 00:45:33.439
We've made this large ledge system
which will connect to the actual summit.

605
00:45:33.522 --> 00:45:35.315
And so. things are going great.

606
00:45:35.441 --> 00:45:37.526
- I heard
the unfortunate news about Bruce.

607
00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:40.738
So. what happened?
And most of all. is he okay?

608
00:45:41.155 --> 00:45:45.576
He has remained in one of the mid camps
on the approach to the wall.

609
00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:48.370
We do have radio communications
with the camp that he's in.

610
00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:50.372
- Roger. I'm here.

611
00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:52.833
I'm as good as can... good can be.

612
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:57.671
We're finding all kinds of wonderful.
exciting. and exotic new species...

613
00:45:58.046 --> 00:46:01.049
...that adds to the world's biodiversity

614
00:46:01.216 --> 00:46:03.302
but also brings attention to this area

615
00:46:03.385 --> 00:46:06.555
as being
a significant biodiversity hotspot.

616
00:46:06.805 --> 00:46:10.934
So. it's a team effort.
Uh. it's not over yet.

617
00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:16.231
The search continues.
and I am ecstatic. Over.

618
00:46:16.523 --> 00:46:19.151
All of this sounds absolutely incredible.

619
00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:22.696
But. you guys. you stay safe
on the final push to the top. okay?

620
00:46:22.988 --> 00:46:24.656
We are... we're rooting for you guys.

621
00:46:26.408 --> 00:46:28.577
- At the elevations
where the vegetation occurs.

622
00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:29.787
it's very wet.

623
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:34.166
and prime habitat for all kinds
of frogs and other animals.

624
00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:38.712
To find a vertebrate animal
that's endemic to the cliffs themselves

625
00:46:39.171 --> 00:46:42.758
would be outstanding.
would be a wonderful find.

626
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:46.512
- This looks dangerous.

627
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:54.520
...I'm gonna go up through
this little tunnel here. Get along.

628
00:46:54.603 --> 00:46:57.189
I think the key is gonna be to stay near
the base of the cliff.

629
00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:03.737
Holy creepy crawly.

630
00:47:04.696 --> 00:47:09.326
Tarantula city.

631
00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:14.748
There was spots where it was just
impenetrable thickets like this.

632
00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:17.000
where you're just. like.
tearing your way through.

633
00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:25.843
Then eventually. we popped out
onto the Wei-Assipu summit plateau.

634
00:47:33.308 --> 00:47:34.560
- Oh. my God.

635
00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:38.397
- This is freaking crazy-looking.

636
00:47:44.444 --> 00:47:47.781
Look at that tree right there.
that's like full-on Dr. Seuss.

637
00:47:52.953 --> 00:47:56.164
Because Bruce couldn't make it up.
it was our job on the summit

638
00:47:56.248 --> 00:48:01.420
to help him complete his life's work
by searching for new species of frogs.

639
00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:04.464
We're up on the plateau.
We're not on the highest point.

640
00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:07.843
but we've basically made it to the top.

641
00:48:09.303 --> 00:48:10.470
Keep your eyes out.

642
00:48:11.346 --> 00:48:13.599
We're definitely. like. in froggy terrain.

643
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:17.978
This is where now we really need
the weather to be good.

644
00:48:18.103 --> 00:48:19.605
because now we have no shelter.

645
00:48:19.688 --> 00:48:21.732
and we're out in the open.
and. of course...

646
00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:28.363
the clouds just come up
over the side of the tepui.

647
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:31.658
And then we're back into the fog.

648
00:48:31.825 --> 00:48:36.204
We can't see anything.
and it starts raining.

649
00:48:37.372 --> 00:48:38.373
- No.

650
00:48:39.791 --> 00:48:42.794
- Are you cold?
Come sit right here. Fuco.

651
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:49.301
- I was almost hypothermic.
I had to crawl with Mark

652
00:48:49.801 --> 00:48:52.512
inside a poncho. beneath the rock.

653
00:48:53.138 --> 00:48:56.308
- Got two guys
under one poncho in this space.

654
00:48:56.391 --> 00:48:59.436
Wanna get...
trying to stay warm on the summit here.

655
00:49:03.398 --> 00:49:07.110
- Yeah. this isn't exactly
the summit glory we were hoping for.

656
00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:10.864
And we haven't been able to find the frog.
and I'm soaked to the bone.

657
00:49:17.371 --> 00:49:19.873
-Looking for frogs.

658
00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:23.794
Sort of like finding
a needle in a haystack.

659
00:49:23.877 --> 00:49:28.048
Bruce seems to find them. no problem.
but... ...it's not that easy.

660
00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:37.057
Sounds like it's in the trees up here.

661
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.183
-Maybe.
-- Yeah.

662
00:49:41.103 --> 00:49:46.316
I had an idea that we... we should look
mostly on the bromeliads.

663
00:49:46.692 --> 00:49:50.737
which is the perfect environment
for a frog to... to hide.

664
00:49:50.904 --> 00:49:51.989
But I couldn't find it.

665
00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:59.329
-- Oh! I... Holy...
-- What's that?

666
00:49:59.454 --> 00:50:00.455
- Creatures!

667
00:50:00.914 --> 00:50:02.624
-- What kind?
-- Tadpoles!

668
00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:05.877
-- Oh. you got one.
-- I got one.

669
00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:09.297
Oh. my God. I found a tadpole.

670
00:50:09.381 --> 00:50:13.719
I mean. obviously. that's a sure sign
that there's frogs around here.

671
00:50:14.136 --> 00:50:16.680
-- Hey. Bruce. It's Mark. Do you copy?

672
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:20.517
Hey. Mark. Where art thou?
Have you made it? Over.

673
00:50:20.892 --> 00:50:23.979
- We are indeed up on the top.
We're on the plateau.

674
00:50:24.146 --> 00:50:30.485
We found a puddle that was just
absolutely filled with tadpoles.

675
00:50:30.819 --> 00:50:33.196
- Fantastic.

676
00:50:33.447 --> 00:50:37.576
I could not be more excited.
It'll be interesting to see what you got.

677
00:50:37.909 --> 00:50:41.705
If you can grab it and bag it for me
and when you get back down here.

678
00:50:41.997 --> 00:50:44.082
we will have
completed the entire transect.

679
00:50:44.332 --> 00:50:45.959
Be safe. Over and out.

680
00:50:47.419 --> 00:50:48.545
- Okay. sounds good.

681
00:50:48.628 --> 00:50:51.381
We'll check back in with you soon.
Okay? Over and out.

682
00:50:57.137 --> 00:50:59.848
The goal was to get Bruce
up to the top of the cliff.

683
00:51:00.932 --> 00:51:04.519
It didn't go. you know.
perfectly according to plan.

684
00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:07.439
Um. But we did the climb.

685
00:51:07.939 --> 00:51:12.819
A first ascent up a tepui
that has never been climbed before.

686
00:51:14.988 --> 00:51:18.158
- We got to the top.
we completed the elevational transect.

687
00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:23.955
and we found the tadpoles to bring down
to Bruce which might be a new species.

688
00:51:25.165 --> 00:51:26.625
That's what we came here for.

689
00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:29.002
And that's really important to me.

690
00:51:29.169 --> 00:51:32.964
because I have seen what happens
in other places out here.

691
00:51:33.507 --> 00:51:35.050
the logging and the mining.

692
00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:39.513
And I think if people know
about this place and how magical it is.

693
00:51:39.721 --> 00:51:40.847
they'll protect it.

694
00:51:45.685 --> 00:51:47.229
-Hey. guys. Hey.
-- Hey!

695
00:51:48.438 --> 00:51:50.107
-Hey.
-Hey!

696
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:52.734
-Good to see you. High five.
-How you doing. bud?

697
00:51:52.818 --> 00:51:54.778
-Oh. Don't get too dirty. I'm so wet.

698
00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:55.862
- Hey. dude.

699
00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.072
-There you are.
-How are you. bud?

700
00:51:57.155 --> 00:51:58.615
-- Oh. my God.
-- I'm pretty famished. so...

701
00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.742
You look like you've lost about 20 pounds.

702
00:52:00.826 --> 00:52:02.160
-Hey. Bruce!
-Fuco!

703
00:52:02.244 --> 00:52:04.412
-I think we captured it.

704
00:52:04.913 --> 00:52:06.957
-Wow. Let's see what you got.
-So good to see you. man.

705
00:52:07.124 --> 00:52:08.125
- Likewise.

706
00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:12.546
This expedition's elevational transect
has been hugely successful.

707
00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:17.050
We have the entire transect now.
and this part of it that. from the summit.

708
00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:21.555
all the way down to Double Drop.
is the part we needed to establish.

709
00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:25.600
And. boy. did we do that in spades.
So. I wish I'd been up there with you.

710
00:52:25.684 --> 00:52:28.395
That was something I had deep in my heart.

711
00:52:28.562 --> 00:52:30.897
However. you did it.
and you did it for us.

712
00:52:40.365 --> 00:52:43.160
- Bruce has an infectious passion
for biology.

713
00:52:44.786 --> 00:52:46.913
I feel like we did something that matters.

714
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:52.043
To collect new species.
to study them. to take DNA samples.

715
00:52:52.794 --> 00:52:55.088
and to basically see something
that no one has ever seen before.

716
00:52:58.633 --> 00:53:00.802
You know. I mean. science has brought us
a long ways. but. I mean.

717
00:53:00.886 --> 00:53:04.389
we're still barely scratching the surface
of what we understand in this world.

718
00:53:09.644 --> 00:53:13.690
- The tepuis are special places
on the planet.

719
00:53:14.649 --> 00:53:18.236
And they're part of my life.
my love. my career.

720
00:53:18.987 --> 00:53:22.574
And so. this trip
is one of the great gifts to me.

721
00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:26.203
And I'd love to do more.

722
00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:30.457
But if I don't get to do it.
this will be a highlight of my life.
