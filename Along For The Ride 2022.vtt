3
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.166
Come on.

4
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:19.000
There's this tradition
at my school.

5
00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.000
Every year.
on the Saturday after graduation.

6
00:00:23.916 --> 00:00:28.791
the seniors of Kiffney-Brown Prep
break into the school's bell tower.

7
00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:30.666
-party at the top…
-Whoo!

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.000
…and take turns
ringing the bell for an hour.

9
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.708
It's a rite of passage that
everyone looks forward to all year.

10
00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:50.750
To mark the end of the hour.

11
00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.791
they TP the tower.

12
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:55.375
Two. one!

13
00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:07.041
It's actually kind of beautiful.

14
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:10.708
It's not supposed to be beautiful.
It's supposed to be a prank.

15
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.625
Right. But. like.
it happens every year. so…

16
00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:21.875
So it's essentially
school-sanctioned. right?

17
00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.916
Like. if they wanted to stop it.
they could.

18
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.333
which is fine. for a tradition.

19
00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:30.291
But I mean. like.
as a transgressive act. it's faulty.

20
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.416
Right?

21
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.416
-If it's faulty. what are you doing here?
-Yeah.

22
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:41.458
I mean. I… I wanna do it.
I… I was just pointing out…

23
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:44.541
Anyway. there's no rule that says
that all seniors have to participate. so…

24
00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:46.916
Come on.
I wanna get a good spot at the top.

25
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.500
Shit.

26
00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:57.291
If this were
an isolated incident. it'd be fine.

27
00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:58.833
Let's go!

28
00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:03.875
But the truth is.
I do this all the time.

29
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:06.375
Which is why.

30
00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:10.166
instead of celebrating at the top
of the bell tower with my classmates.

31
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.166
I'm at home

32
00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:15.083
with my mom and her colleagues.

33
00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:17.541
a bunch of old people.

34
00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:19.250
Nothing is gonna change

35
00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:22.166
when we don't recognize
a woman merits our attention

36
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.083
unless she's married to
or having sex with a more famous man.

37
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:30.041
And that is why
I'm never getting married again.

38
00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:38.125
-What are your plans for the summer?
-I'm spending it with my father in Colby.

39
00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.625
She thinks that they're gonna bond.

40
00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:42.083
-Mom.

41
00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:44.291
It's a judgment on your father. not you.

42
00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:48.416
I'm saving money for college.

43
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.541
I'm gonna work in my stepmom's store.

44
00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:53.583
And what was the name of that place?
Oh. um…

45
00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:56.083
Cupcake Glitter Breast Implants.

46
00:02:57.625 --> 00:02:58.958
Good for you. Auden.

47
00:02:59.041 --> 00:03:02.083
A summer at the beach sounds like
the perfect reward for all your hard work.

48
00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:05.500
I offered for her
to be my research assistant.

49
00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:07.208
but she chose this.

50
00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:11.166
I know my mom doesn't understand
why I wanna go to Colby.

51
00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:16.583
but it's like I only know
how to be one kind of person here.

52
00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:19.791
I've never done anything
you can't read about on my transcript.

53
00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:27.333
But maybe if I go to Colby.
I can be someone else.

54
00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.750
Someone different.

55
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:40.000
Or it will be exactly the same.
and I can't change.

56
00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:42.958
I don't know.

57
00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:48.333
but I'm willing to bet
the summer on it to find out.

58
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.125
Auden. hi!

59
00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:21.041
I'm just calling again
to say how capital E excited

60
00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:22.791
your dad and I are to see you this summer.

61
00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:24.958
Let me know the second
you think you're gonna arrive.

62
00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:27.666
Call me from the Colby sign--
No. call me before the Colby sign.

63
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.791
Call me every ten minutes
because I cannot wait!

64
00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:31.500
Wait. you know. it's Heidi. right?
It's me.

65
00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:33.541
It's Heidi. your stepmom. XOXO.

78
00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:54.541
I thought you were your father.
and I… and I just got her to sleep.

79
00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:57.541
and…
…I totally forgot what day it was.

80
00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:59.666
-It's okay.
-I had everything planned.

81
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.416
Banners. balloons. I even bookmarked ideas
for a "Welcome to Colby"-themed brunch.

82
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.333
I swear to God. all last week.
I kept thinking to myself.

83
00:06:07.416 --> 00:06:09.458
"This is your stepdaughter.
This is Thisbe's sister."

84
00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:10.666
"You missed her graduation.

85
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.541
so you better get your ass in the kitchen
and make this welcome special."

86
00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:14.625
Is my dad here?

87
00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:18.500
-Oh. he's in his office.

88
00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:19.666
He's always in his office.

89
00:06:22.833 --> 00:06:24.083
-Yeah?
-Dad?

90
00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:26.208
Oh! Hey!

91
00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:28.125
-There she is. Come on in. come in.
-Hey.

92
00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:30.916
And before you say anything. I know.
It's a disaster area.

93
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.958
But I bet you remember that
from when I was working on Narwhal.

94
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:36.500
Gotta say. Dad. in my memory
of that time of our lives.

95
00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:39.875
the status of your office cleanliness
is not exactly what comes to mind.

96
00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.708
Yeah. 'cause
your parents were breaking up.

97
00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:43.958
Something about that.

98
00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:46.708
Hey. are ya hungry?
I know a great place for onion rings.

99
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:49.708
Really? Yeah. I'd… I'd love to.

100
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:51.791
Great. great. Head out to the boardwalk.

101
00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:55.416
You can't miss it.
It's called. uh. Last Chance. Here you go.

102
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:59.750
-You're not coming?
-I wish I could. but I'm really swamped.

103
00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:02.416
But if you wouldn't mind
bringing me back a burger.

104
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.291
that'd be. uh. that'd be great.

105
00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:06.791
They have those caramelized onions.
so good.

106
00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:08.583
Yeah. of course.

107
00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:09.750
-Thanks. Aud.
-Yeah.

108
00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:12.791
-I'm so glad you're here. Aw.
-Yeah. me too.

109
00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:15.333
-Great.
-Okay.

110
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.458
Oh my God!

111
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.708
Auden…
…you snuck up on me there.

112
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.916
I'm gonna go for a walk.
Do you need anything?

113
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.083
-You should go to the Tip.
-The Tip?

114
00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:00.250
Yeah. It's where all the cool.
young people hang out.

115
00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:01.166
Super fun.

116
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.958
-Can't miss it.
-Right.

117
00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:06.458
-Don't be nervous.
-I'm not.

118
00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:10.708
Oh. when you get there. ask for Maggie.
She's my favorite. She's great.

119
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.416
Cool. Uh. thanks.

120
00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:15.166
You're young. Have fun.

Swear. I'm telling the truth ♪

122
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.125

123

-What's up?
-Okay. All right.

124
00:08:47.041 --> 00:08:48.875
So you're a summer transplant.

125
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.208
-Yeah. I guess you can call me that.
-That's chill.

126
00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:56.541
We've been broken up for two weeks.
and he's doing this in front of me.

127
00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:58.916
-Just don't look.
-Maybe they're cousins.

128
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.208
They're not cousins!

129
00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:03.166
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm.

130
00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:04.958
Yeah.

131
00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:07.125
Um. wait. I'm sorry.

132
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.458
Is everything okay?

133
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:11.750
Yeah. Yes. Um. it's just…

134
00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:14.708
Have you ever done something
to be a different version of yourself.

135
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:18.958
but once you're in the middle of it.
you think like. "Wow. this is so not me"?

136
00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:24.083
-You're gay?
-Oh. no. I mean. I don't think so.

137
00:09:24.166 --> 00:09:25.208
It's all a spectrum. right?

138
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:27.458
-But I was more talking about--

139
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:29.875
It's okay. all right?
Look. I'm not offended.

140
00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.458
You're figuring this out.
and that's chill.

141
00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:36.333
But if you're not feelin' it with me.
you're probably not feelin' it with dudes

142
00:09:36.416 --> 00:09:39.500
because all the honeys love the Jake.

143
00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:44.416
Oh. that's so cool. Um. I gotta go.

144
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.291
But thank you. I'm sorry.
Thank you. So--

145
00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:52.541
Oh. um. do you by any chance know
where I could find someone named Maggie?

146
00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:55.875
-Are you being serious? Is that a joke?
-What? No.

147
00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.333
-Never mind. Sorry.

148
00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:03.583
Oh! Here she comes.
Looks like they're done.

149
00:10:03.666 --> 00:10:04.750
But. like. I'm fine.

150
00:10:04.833 --> 00:10:06.416
-You're okay?
-I'm fine.

151
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.125
They had a great time. and I am fine.
I'm doing good. I'm not.

152
00:10:10.208 --> 00:10:12.041
-Who is that?
-Never seen her.

153
00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:14.041
-I don't know her.
-You're fine?

154
00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:16.083
I'm fine. I'm great.

155
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.875
-I told you to get a nanny.
-I'm not asking for the world.

156
00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.666
I'm asking for 20 minutes
so I can brush my teeth and shower.

157
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.500
-Yeah. but it wasn't 20 minutes.
-Oh my gosh--

158
00:11:37.166 --> 00:11:38.875
Auden? Is that you?

159
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.458
Hi.

160
00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:42.750
Aw.

161
00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:45.000
-Good morning. sleepyhead.
-Morning.

162
00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:46.666
You just wake up?

163
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.833
-Yeah. it's kind of unusual for me.
-Oh.

164
00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:51.291
-Yeah. I better get back to it.
-Mm-hmm.

165
00:11:52.208 --> 00:11:53.541
-Morning. kiddo.
-Morning.

166
00:11:55.833 --> 00:11:57.208
-Coffee.
-Mm-hmm.

167
00:11:57.833 --> 00:12:00.583
I didn't mean
to make you feel guilty about sleeping in.

168
00:12:00.666 --> 00:12:03.583
It's just that
I have zero sense of time right now.

169
00:12:03.666 --> 00:12:05.125
-It's okay.

170
00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:09.666
So. you ready for your big day?

171
00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:13.625
-Your first day at the store. silly.
-Oh.

172
00:12:13.708 --> 00:12:15.125
And don't worry.

173
00:12:15.208 --> 00:12:17.416
You don't need a schedule
as long as everything gets done.

174
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.750
which I know it will.
with you being Little Miss Honor Society.

175
00:12:20.833 --> 00:12:22.833
Don't think I don't brag about you
to everybody.

176
00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:25.000
-Wow.

177
00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:27.041
I'm so excited
for you to meet the crew.

178
00:12:27.125 --> 00:12:28.166
Do you like flamingos?

179
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.125
-Aren't they the best bird?
-They're cool.

180
00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:33.958
And voilà. Welcome to my nirvana.

181
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.875
-It's great.
-Would you mind?

182
00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.791
-Oh. yeah. of course.
-Oh. thank you.

183
00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:47.500
Okay. Where are my ladies?

184
00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:49.166
-Oh my God!

185
00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:52.333
Aw.

186
00:12:52.416 --> 00:12:53.541
She's so beautiful.

187
00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:55.125
OMG. her eyelashes.

188
00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:57.416
Are you dying
over how cute she is?

189
00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.916
Oh. I missed you girls.

190
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.750
Well. don't worry about a thing here
because we've got everything covered.

191
00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:07.750
The Booty Berry perfume came in.
and people are freaking out about it.

192
00:13:07.833 --> 00:13:10.625
And the lock-and-key necklaces
have been restocked three times.

193
00:13:10.708 --> 00:13:12.541
Did I tell you. or did I tell you?

194
00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:13.500
-Did I tell you?
-Yep.

195
00:13:13.583 --> 00:13:15.541
-I told you. I told you.
-You told us.

196
00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:19.041
Oh! And this.
Why are you hiding in the corner?

197
00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:22.083
-Sorry.
-This is who I've been telling you about.

198
00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:24.541
My genius stepdaughter. Auden.

199
00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:27.666
Auden. this is Esther. Leah. and Maggie.

200
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.041
Oh. we've met.

201
00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:32.583
-We have?
-At the Tip. You know my ex. Jake.

202
00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:34.833
-Oh. yeah.
-Oh. good.

203
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:39.875
Now I know you girls will take Auden
under your wing and show her all the spots

204
00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.875
and make her feel
super comfortable here in Colby. right?

205
00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.083
-Mm-hmm.

206
00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:48.500
All right. I better get
the little one home before she has to eat.

207
00:13:48.583 --> 00:13:51.000
Can I just tell you. my nipples…

208
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.041
But I love
that you four are a new little crew.

209
00:13:56.125 --> 00:13:57.875
So much fun.

210
00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:01.000
-You good?
-Yeah.

211
00:14:01.083 --> 00:14:02.375
-Good. Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

212
00:14:02.458 --> 00:14:03.916
Love you guys. Bye.

213
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.791
-Let me get the door.
-Okay. let's go!

214
00:14:05.875 --> 00:14:07.666
Let's go into the world. We got this.

215
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.875
Okay! Here we go! Here we go!

216
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.250
-Why don't I show you the office?
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

217
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.375
All the accounting stuff is in here.

218
00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:26.791
Cool. Thanks.

219
00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:30.833
Look. don't worry about Maggie.
She'll get over it.

220
00:14:31.583 --> 00:14:33.208
It's just Jake is like her kryptonite.

221
00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:35.125
They were together
for two years in high school.

222
00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:38.250
They broke up right before graduation.
It wasn't her idea.

223
00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:41.083
-She was with that guy for two years?
-Hmm.

224
00:14:41.166 --> 00:14:42.708
What's the matter with her?

225
00:14:43.625 --> 00:14:46.833
-What's the matter with me?
-Oh. Maggie. I… I didn't--

226
00:14:46.916 --> 00:14:49.083
-Here. last night's receipts.
-I'm sorry.

227
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.208
-I should--
-Yeah. Do you need more pens?

228
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:03.083
-No. I'm good. Thank you.
-No. That's a lot of pens. Good luck.

00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:41.583
Not specifically.
but yeah. like… like kid stuff.

338
00:23:42.666 --> 00:23:45.666
Kid stuff? What does that mean?

339
00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:49.791
I don't know.
Like… like stuff you read about in books.

340
00:23:50.458 --> 00:23:53.208
Food fights. trespassing…

341
00:23:54.875 --> 00:23:56.416
Classic indoor kid. huh?

342
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.750
More like my mom wasn't
really interested in any of that.

343
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.833
Can I let you in on a secret?

344
00:24:05.291 --> 00:24:07.166
Nobody's having
food fights with their mom.

345
00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:09.541
I know. I mean…

346
00:24:09.625 --> 00:24:12.208
I mean. she wasn't interested
in any of that for me.

347
00:24:12.708 --> 00:24:16.750
She made it sound silly or something.

348
00:24:16.833 --> 00:24:18.625
Okay. just to be clear.

349
00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:22.416
you've never been trespassing
or had a food fight. but. like.

350
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.333
you do know how to ride a bike. right?

351
00:24:29.375 --> 00:24:31.708
Yes. everyone knows how to ride a bike.

352
00:24:32.416 --> 00:24:33.625
Just checking.

353
00:24:39.666 --> 00:24:44.083
So. thanks for showing me
the secret pie shop.

354
00:24:44.166 --> 00:24:47.333
random Colby bike guy
who appears in the mist.

355
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.916
What?

356
00:24:49.583 --> 00:24:51.083
You never told me your name.

357
00:24:52.208 --> 00:24:54.041
-I didn't?
-No.

358
00:24:54.833 --> 00:24:55.666
Oh.

359
00:24:57.291 --> 00:24:58.291
I'm Eli.

360
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:00.708
Nice to meet you. Eli.

361
00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:02.208
You too.

362
00:25:06.208 --> 00:25:09.250
Would you maybe wanna hang out again?

363
00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:12.166
-Why. you need a kid-stuff guru?
-What?

364
00:25:12.833 --> 00:25:15.000
No. Never mind.

365
00:25:15.083 --> 00:25:17.666
Wait. wait. Sor--
I'm sorry. I'm kidding.

366
00:25:18.458 --> 00:25:20.333
I mean. I'm kidding. but I'm serious.

367
00:25:21.125 --> 00:25:24.500
Just thinking about what you said.
and I think you should do it.

368
00:25:25.541 --> 00:25:26.416
Do what?

369
00:25:27.583 --> 00:25:29.833
Think of a bunch of stuff
you haven't done.

370
00:25:29.916 --> 00:25:31.333
and just start doing 'em.

371
00:25:31.916 --> 00:25:34.875
It could be. uh. like a quest.

372
00:25:36.958 --> 00:25:38.791
-A quest?
-Yeah. yeah.

373
00:25:38.875 --> 00:25:40.958
That sounds ridiculous.

374
00:25:41.041 --> 00:25:43.541
-What? What is ridiculous about it?

375
00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:44.750
I don't know.

376
00:25:45.333 --> 00:25:49.375
I tried to be a different person once
this summer. and it was comically bad.

377
00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:51.583
Yeah? Did it happen at the Tip?

378
00:25:52.208 --> 00:25:53.166
Why do you ask?

379
00:25:54.125 --> 00:25:55.291
In my experience.

380
00:25:55.375 --> 00:25:58.000
most comically bad scenarios
take place at the Tip.

381
00:25:58.083 --> 00:25:59.833
I mean. with a name like that…

382
00:25:59.916 --> 00:26:01.583
-How could they not?
-Yeah.

383
00:26:04.583 --> 00:26:06.083
Uh. I'm just up here.

384
00:26:07.208 --> 00:26:09.708
Will you think about it? The quest?

385
00:26:12.083 --> 00:26:15.625
You seem awfully invested
in my life for a stranger. Eli.

386
00:26:15.708 --> 00:26:18.916
I already told you.
Nobody's a stranger in Colby.

387
00:26:20.625 --> 00:26:22.958
See you later. Vertical Checkers.

388
00:26:58.166 --> 00:27:00.500
It's after two. Go to bed.

389
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:05.000
I can't. If I put her down.
she'll just start screaming.

390
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:07.916
Give her to me.

391
00:27:10.375 --> 00:27:11.541
Are you sure?

392
00:27:11.625 --> 00:27:15.125
Yeah.
I never go to bed this early. I want to.

393
00:27:18.416 --> 00:27:20.166
-Okay.
-Yeah.

394
00:27:21.916 --> 00:27:24.000
Oh. do you wanna see Auden?

395
00:27:24.083 --> 00:27:26.250
-You wanna see. Thisbe?
-Hi. Thisbe.

396
00:27:27.708 --> 00:27:30.000
-Hey. Hi.
-Oh.

397
00:27:38.791 --> 00:27:40.625
Who were you out with so late?

398
00:27:42.041 --> 00:27:43.000
No one.

399
00:27:43.958 --> 00:27:46.791
Okay. No one.

400
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.375
I'm glad you're making friends.

401
00:27:51.041 --> 00:27:52.125
Thanks.

402
00:27:56.833 --> 00:27:58.583
Can I tell you a secret?

403
00:28:00.833 --> 00:28:02.458
It's not so bad here.

404
00:28:16.583 --> 00:28:17.541
Yo. Leah.

405
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.708
Hmm. Ooh!

406
00:28:22.041 --> 00:28:24.000
Thank you
for shopping at Clementine's.

407
00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:26.000
Did you get snacks?

408
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.666
Eli's covering front of shop
so Adam could do snack run at Gas Gro.

409
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.125
Really? I thought
Eli never left the workshop.

410
00:28:32.208 --> 00:28:35.416
Do you think if I tell Adam
Maggie wants chips. he'll go back?

411
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.583
I'm in a savory mood.

412
00:28:36.666 --> 00:28:38.541
Stop. He was just being nice.

413
00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:39.625
Dude. are you okay?

414
00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:46.375
Uh… Oh. yeah. I… I was just… receipts.

415
00:28:50.541 --> 00:28:52.958
And. uh. did… did you say "Eli"?

416
00:28:53.041 --> 00:28:54.791
Yes. Why?

417
00:28:54.875 --> 00:28:56.500
So you. like. know him?

418
00:28:56.583 --> 00:28:58.958
I think the real question is.
how do you know him?

419
00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:02.250
I don't. I… I mean. I've… I've met him.

420
00:29:02.333 --> 00:29:04.416
Define "met."

421
00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:06.708
I should get back to work.

422
00:29:14.541 --> 00:29:19.208
Damn! Jake and Eli?
Talk about a low-key playa.

423
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:21.125
Nothing's going on with her and Eli.

424
00:29:21.208 --> 00:29:22.083
How do you know?

425
00:29:22.166 --> 00:29:25.708
Think about it. When was the last time
he had something going on with anyone?

426
00:29:25.791 --> 00:29:26.625
Before Abe.

427
00:29:27.333 --> 00:29:28.291
Exactly.

428
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.958
You busy?

429
00:29:47.666 --> 00:29:48.666
Mini-golf?

430
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.791
Is this your way
of trying to spoon-feed me the quest?

431
00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:54.875
Yes. Vertical Checkers.

432
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.708
That is a fun conspiracy.

433
00:29:57.791 --> 00:30:00.583
-Hi. Two. please.

434
00:30:00.666 --> 00:30:02.916
-Ever been go-karting?
-No.

435
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.208
-Skydiving? No.
-No.

436
00:30:05.708 --> 00:30:07.458
-Bowling?
-Yes.

437
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:08.375
-Okay.
-I have.

438
00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:09.583
Yeah. how sick.

439
00:30:10.083 --> 00:30:13.125
-Did you go to prom?
-No.

440
00:30:13.708 --> 00:30:14.666
Why not?

441
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:19.125
I guess I'm just not one of those people
who thought high school is supposed to be

442
00:30:19.208 --> 00:30:20.958
this. like. big party.

443
00:30:21.041 --> 00:30:25.375
I was more interested in working hard
so the rest of my life could be great.

444
00:30:26.166 --> 00:30:29.833
Okay. but come on. I mean. even the kids
who hate high school still go to prom.

445
00:30:30.333 --> 00:30:34.583
unless. uh. you're too cool for it.
which is the vibe I'm getting from you.

446
00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:35.750
It's not that.

447
00:30:36.416 --> 00:30:39.291
It's. I guess.
um. I got stood up.

448
00:30:39.875 --> 00:30:43.333
Oh God. I'm sorry. That's terrible.

449
00:30:43.416 --> 00:30:45.833
No. Oh my God. Please don't feel bad.

450
00:30:45.916 --> 00:30:49.875
I was supposed to go with this guy. Jason.
He was just like a lab partner.

451
00:30:49.958 --> 00:30:51.166
It was a friends' thing.

452
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.333
And… Well. he got invited
to a conference at Duke. so…

453
00:30:54.416 --> 00:30:58.458
It was. like. so not a big deal.
I couldn't care less about prom.

454
00:30:59.875 --> 00:31:00.791
Huh.

455
00:31:01.666 --> 00:31:03.666
Really? Are you sure?

456
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.625
Okay. fine. Uh. maybe the one thing
that sucked a little was the dress.

457
00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:11.458
-The dress?
-Yeah.

458
00:31:11.541 --> 00:31:14.375
I was downtown one day.
going to used bookstores.

459
00:31:14.458 --> 00:31:16.416
and I wandered into this store.

460
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.000
and there was this dress on a mannequin
that was just. like. so cool.

461
00:31:21.708 --> 00:31:22.541
Um…

462
00:31:22.625 --> 00:31:27.791
You know. if I regret anything.
it's not being able to wear the dress.

463
00:31:28.833 --> 00:31:32.666
But prom itself? Yeah. pass.

464
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.250
Did you bring it to Colby with you?

465
00:31:35.875 --> 00:31:36.750
No.

466
00:31:37.916 --> 00:31:38.791
No?

467
00:31:38.875 --> 00:31:41.041
Where would I wear
something like that here?

468
00:31:41.125 --> 00:31:42.750
Anywhere.

469
00:31:43.666 --> 00:31:44.625
What?

470
00:31:45.333 --> 00:31:47.791
Yeah. wear it to. uh. skip rocks.

471
00:31:47.875 --> 00:31:49.125
Wear it to drink Cokes.

472
00:31:49.666 --> 00:31:52.250
I mean. it doesn't matter
where you wear it

473
00:31:52.333 --> 00:31:54.083
if it's about the dress. right?

474
00:31:55.083 --> 00:31:56.041
I guess.

475
00:31:56.958 --> 00:31:57.916
Hmm.

476
00:31:59.458 --> 00:32:01.500
You know. it's a shame
you didn't bring that dress

477
00:32:01.583 --> 00:32:04.500
because it would have been
perfect for the quest.

478
00:32:04.583 --> 00:32:06.416
Eli. we're not doing the quest.

479
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.000
Oh. Auden. Of course we are.

480
00:32:11.958 --> 00:32:15.291
What about you? We've been talking
about me this whole time.

481
00:32:15.375 --> 00:32:18.708
Yeah. well. that's because
you're a lot more interesting than I am.

482
00:32:18.791 --> 00:32:20.916
Stop deflecting. Your turn.

483
00:32:22.875 --> 00:32:26.458
I don't know. Sometimes I feel
like all I've ever done is goof off.

484
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.291
I even made a career out of it.

485
00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:32.083
-I mean. for a minute.
-How'd you do that?

486
00:32:33.541 --> 00:32:36.208
Just. uh. bike stuff. Whatever.

487
00:32:37.583 --> 00:32:40.916
You know. now it's like.
what does it all add up to?

488
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.958
Just. uh. some grainy clips on YouTube?
Bunch of stupid stories?

489
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:51.833
I think that everyone deserves
a do-over if they want it.

490
00:32:51.916 --> 00:32:54.750
You know? Wish I could have a do-over.

491
00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:57.416
A do-over for what?

492
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
You. uh…

493
00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:09.333
You didn't win.
but it's a very respectable performance.

494
00:33:09.416 --> 00:33:10.500
I will say.

495
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:12.833
Can I keep it?

496
00:33:15.375 --> 00:33:18.583
Just in case anyone ever asks
if I've played mini-golf.

497
00:33:18.666 --> 00:33:20.375
it'd be good to have proof.

498
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.583
'Course. Yeah. gotta have proof.

499
00:33:56.541 --> 00:33:58.291
I hate when it rains.

500
00:33:58.375 --> 00:34:01.333
-Can't be a beach day every day.
-Why not?

501
00:34:01.416 --> 00:34:02.875
I'll go get the ponchos.

502
00:34:10.291 --> 00:34:13.250
-Sorry. the ponchos are back here.
-Oh. I can get them.

503
00:34:18.708 --> 00:34:21.583
Oh my God. These are awful.

504
00:34:22.083 --> 00:34:25.625
When you say stuff like that.
you act like you're speaking for everyone.

505
00:34:25.708 --> 00:34:28.041
when really.
you're only speaking for yourself.

506
00:34:29.083 --> 00:34:30.208
Oh. I…

507
00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:31.416
Um…

508
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.666
You're right. Sorry.

509
00:34:34.166 --> 00:34:36.208
Auden. you have a visitor.

510
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.166
Mom. Hi.

511
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.625
Auden. Hello.

512
00:34:52.833 --> 00:34:54.750
Can we help you find something?

513
00:34:56.583 --> 00:34:58.916
I'm gonna wait for you outside.

514
00:35:04.541 --> 00:35:05.500
Here.

515
00:35:06.958 --> 00:35:09.958
I know what you're gonna say.
but come on. you'll get soaked.

516
00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:11.041
Thanks.

517
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.750
Have you sampled the local cuisine?

518
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:33.791
-What?
-Where would you like to have lunch?

519
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.541
Um. there's a place on the boardwalk
with good onion rings.

520
00:35:37.625 --> 00:35:38.958
How charming.

521
00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:47.625
So.

522
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:51.750
how's it going? Bonding with your father?

523
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.833
Good.

524
00:35:54.416 --> 00:35:56.041
I mean. he's kind of busy.

525
00:35:56.625 --> 00:35:58.583
He's just working really hard.

526
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:04.583
The thing about your father is. uh.
he enjoys the performance of working

527
00:36:04.666 --> 00:36:07.750
arguably more than he does
the actual work.

528
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.916
And Heidi?

529
00:36:10.708 --> 00:36:11.750
Heidi's nice.

530
00:36:11.833 --> 00:36:13.208
Of course she's nice.

531
00:36:13.291 --> 00:36:15.791
Women like her are always nice.

532
00:36:15.875 --> 00:36:18.791
They have to be.
It's part of the job description.

533
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:23.708
Poor thing. She must be exhausted.
caring for the infant all by herself.

534
00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:24.666
Dad helps.

535
00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:29.208
Auden. who do you think you're talking to?

536
00:36:33.416 --> 00:36:34.416
Ah.

537
00:36:36.291 --> 00:36:38.375
Oh! That's quite the raincoat.

538
00:36:38.458 --> 00:36:40.958
-Okay. Just say it. Mom.

539
00:36:41.041 --> 00:36:41.916
Say what?

540
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.833
Whatever it is you wanna say.

541
00:36:46.083 --> 00:36:49.041
You'll have to forgive me
if I find it alarming

542
00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:52.916
how easily you've adapted to the world
of your father's new wife.

543
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.083
That's insane. I'm… I'm exactly the same
as I've always been.

544
00:36:58.166 --> 00:37:01.250
Look. sweetheart. I realize
that you're doing soul-searching.

545
00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:03.750
and that's fine. It's normal. even.

546
00:37:03.833 --> 00:37:07.250
Just don't let this little break
from reality come at a cost.

547
00:37:08.166 --> 00:37:13.875
Your classmates from Defriese
are not spending the summer hawking thongs

548
00:37:13.958 --> 00:37:16.208
and doing keg stands.

549
00:37:16.291 --> 00:37:19.041
I'm not doing keg stands. Mom.

550
00:37:20.208 --> 00:37:21.750
We'll see.

551
00:37:29.291 --> 00:37:30.166
Hey.

552
00:37:31.333 --> 00:37:32.541
Maggie. hi.

553
00:37:34.416 --> 00:37:36.500
Your mom's kind of intense. huh?

554
00:37:37.666 --> 00:37:39.208
Yeah. you could say that.

555
00:37:40.125 --> 00:37:44.833
She's a legend as a professor.
but it must be hard to be her daughter.

556
00:37:46.166 --> 00:37:47.666
You know who my mom is?

557
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:51.375
Of course. I almost went to the U
just so I could take her classes.

558
00:37:52.208 --> 00:37:54.291
But I couldn't turn down Defriese.

559
00:37:54.375 --> 00:37:56.000
You're going to Defriese?

560
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.250
I'm going to Defriese.

561
00:37:59.333 --> 00:38:01.083
I know. Heidi told me.

562
00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:05.041
I'm starting to understand why.

563
00:38:05.125 --> 00:38:07.708
when you saw me.
you thought. "Wow. I hate her."

564
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.125
Actually. when I first saw you. I thought.

565
00:38:11.208 --> 00:38:14.791
"I'm so depressed that cool. hot girl's
hooking up with my boyfriend."

566
00:38:15.666 --> 00:38:18.291
-Yeah.
-I didn't form an opinion until later.

567
00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:24.083
Fair. That is fair.

568
00:38:24.625 --> 00:38:28.750
But what wasn't fair was being
so hard on you about the Jake stuff.

569
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.333
I mean. you didn't even know me.

570
00:38:31.416 --> 00:38:33.791
Yeah. but I still feel bad.

571
00:38:33.875 --> 00:38:36.541
It's okay. He's a tool.

572
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.208
I'm not gonna say anything.

573
00:38:39.291 --> 00:38:42.291
It's okay.
I've come to accept it.

574
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:46.416
But at least he's. you know. a hot one.

575
00:38:49.291 --> 00:38:52.000
I'll give you that. He's… he's a hot tool.

576
00:38:53.833 --> 00:38:57.041
Okay. come on.
I promised Heidi I would show you around.

577
00:38:57.125 --> 00:38:59.708
and I've been delinquent
with my responsibilities.

578
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.833
Esther and Leah are sitting up there
if you wanna head over.

579
00:39:03.916 --> 00:39:05.833
-Where are you going?
-I'll be up in a bit.

580
00:39:07.458 --> 00:39:08.416
-Hey.
-Hey.

581
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.666
She roped you into this too?

582
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:13.208
No worse than
when you roped us into going to Ossify

583
00:39:13.291 --> 00:39:15.875
to watch that guy recite
his shopping list over a drumbeat.

584
00:39:15.958 --> 00:39:17.750
Why did Maggie wanna come here?

585
00:39:17.833 --> 00:39:18.875
Why do you think?

586
00:39:19.458 --> 00:39:21.125
Is she into one of those guys?

587
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:23.083
You'll see.

588
00:39:24.458 --> 00:39:25.500
Wait. what?

589
00:39:27.625 --> 00:39:28.833
What's happening?

590
00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:32.333
This… this is a joke.
You guys are playing a joke on me.

591
00:39:33.791 --> 00:39:34.625
She's…

592
00:39:34.708 --> 00:39:36.083
This is… this is Maggie.

593
00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:38.625
-This is Maggie.
-I know. We've seen this before.

594
00:39:38.708 --> 00:39:42.208
Do all people who do BMX
have two little assistants like that?

595
00:39:42.291 --> 00:39:44.333
-Absolutely not.
-No. just Maggie.

596
00:39:48.625 --> 00:39:49.500

Get snacks too.

Okay. but Auden's coming in too
'cause she looks the oldest.

624
00:41:11.708 --> 00:41:13.583
So. what's your snack profile?

625
00:41:13.666 --> 00:41:17.250
Maggie likes sour gummy bears.
Cute. but with an edge. like she is.

626
00:41:17.333 --> 00:41:19.541

00:41:24.625 --> 00:41:27.416
A coffee? No.

630
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.333
You need something with snack bang.

631
00:41:29.416 --> 00:41:32.625
Like. what if we end up at the Tip later.
and you're starving?

632
00:41:32.708 --> 00:41:34.916
It's not like you can get food at the Tip.

633
00:41:35.916 --> 00:41:36.833
Okay.

00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:40.416

00:43:43.833 --> 00:43:45.250
Anything like the last time…

661
00:43:45.333 --> 00:43:48.916
Wallace. he jumped off the second story
into that kiddie pool. remember?

662
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.291
-Yes.
-You tried to steal a dog.

663
00:43:51.375 --> 00:43:53.125
Okay. I know.
That was a wild night.

664
00:43:53.208 --> 00:43:54.958

00:44:03.333 --> 00:44:04.791
How do you know these people?

667
00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:07.000
Well. we don't know all of them.
Some we grew up with.

668
00:44:07.083 --> 00:44:08.750
Some are alums
who come home for the summer.

669
00:44:08.833 --> 00:44:12.125
Some Eastern Europeans who come work
at the restaurants during our busy season.

670
00:44:12.208 --> 00:44:13.375
Why Eastern Europeans?

671
00:44:13.458 --> 00:44:15.208
I don't know.
It's just always been like that.

672
00:44:15.291 --> 00:44:16.416
Speaking of which…

673
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.583
Yeah. I'm from Colby.
Where'd you say you're from? Uh. Latvia?

674
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:22.250
-How long was that drive?

675
00:44:22.333 --> 00:44:23.541
Ugh.

676
00:44:24.125 --> 00:44:26.750
I don't understand why he feels the need
to declare himself

677
00:44:26.833 --> 00:44:30.458
unofficial ambassador of Colby
to every new girl in town.

678
00:44:31.458 --> 00:44:32.750
Oh. no offense.

679
00:44:32.833 --> 00:44:34.041
-No. It's okay.
-Come on.

680
00:44:34.125 --> 00:44:35.875
We don't need to watch. Let's just go.

681
00:44:35.958 --> 00:44:36.958
Come on.

682
00:44:37.583 --> 00:44:40.291
-Let's go this way and get away from him.
-Yeah.

683
00:44:40.375 --> 00:44:42.291
Hey. Maggie. up here. Hey. hey.

684
00:44:42.375 --> 00:44:44.875
Dude. Dude. calm down.
We saw her an hour ago.

685
00:44:44.958 --> 00:44:47.041
So what? I'm just saying hi.

686
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.083
♪ She keeps it simple ♪

687
00:44:58.166 --> 00:45:03.708
♪ And I am thankful
For her kind of lovin' ♪

688
00:45:04.791 --> 00:45:07.375
♪ 'Cause it's simple ♪

689
00:45:09.458 --> 00:45:11.791
♪ No longer do we wonder… ♪

690
00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:13.541
She's really good.

691
00:45:13.625 --> 00:45:18.666
She is. but it loses its appeal
when they do the same song at every party.

692
00:45:21.333 --> 00:45:25.500
♪ So. in January we're gettin' married… ♪

693
00:45:25.583 --> 00:45:27.500
So. Eli…

694
00:45:28.041 --> 00:45:31.041
Oh. I was waiting for this one.

695
00:45:31.125 --> 00:45:34.500
I'm just curious
because we're kind of friends.

696
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.625
Never mind.
Unless you think he might come tonight?

697
00:45:38.708 --> 00:45:39.791
You wish.

698
00:45:39.875 --> 00:45:41.875
He never comes to stuff like this.

699
00:45:42.708 --> 00:45:44.541
Not anymore. at least.

700
00:45:45.041 --> 00:45:45.916
Not since Abe.

701
00:45:46.583 --> 00:45:47.916
Abe. Right.

702
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:51.000
-Has he told you about Abe?
-Yeah.

703
00:45:51.958 --> 00:45:52.958
No.

704
00:45:54.458 --> 00:45:58.416
Okay. So Abe was Eli's best friend.

705
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.208
Eli and Abe both did street BMX.

706
00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:06.041
Probably because that's what Clyde was
most into. and they both idolize him.

707
00:46:06.125 --> 00:46:08.750
But anyway. they were amazing.

708
00:46:08.833 --> 00:46:13.250
Both sponsored. won crazy competitions.
in a league of their own.

709
00:46:13.333 --> 00:46:15.458
Everyone thought that
after they graduated.

710
00:46:15.541 --> 00:46:18.833
they would move to.
like. Barcelona or Berlin.

711
00:46:18.916 --> 00:46:21.875
One of those European cities
with great streets for riding.

712
00:46:21.958 --> 00:46:23.250
Is that what Abe did?

713
00:46:24.791 --> 00:46:25.666
No.

714
00:46:26.166 --> 00:46:27.375
Abe died.

715
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
He and Eli had gone to New York
for the weekend for this big invitational.

716
00:46:33.583 --> 00:46:38.666
On their way home.
only. like. 20 miles outside of Colby.

717
00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:40.875
a drunk driver hit them.

718
00:46:40.958 --> 00:46:42.541
Eli was driving.

719
00:46:45.291 --> 00:46:48.791
After the funeral. he totally shut down.
Now he's like a ghost.

720
00:46:48.875 --> 00:46:51.583
Gave up his sponsorship. stopped riding.

721
00:46:51.666 --> 00:46:55.500
Works in the back of a shop doing repairs
and never hangs anymore.

722
00:46:57.083 --> 00:47:01.916
Which is why it was so surprising to us
when he started hanging out with you.

723
00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:11.250
Westley. what about the R.O.U.S.s?

724
00:47:11.333 --> 00:47:14.500
Rodents of Unusual Size?
I don't think they exist.

725
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.333
All right.
Check these guys out.

726
00:47:33.333 --> 00:47:34.625
I love this part.

727
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:40.666
What?

728
00:47:41.166 --> 00:47:43.125
-Westley!
-You hate it?

729
00:47:43.708 --> 00:47:45.916
No. giant rats are cool.

730
00:47:48.083 --> 00:47:48.958
Okay. hold on.

731
00:47:51.708 --> 00:47:54.833
So what was your favorite movie
in the fourth grade? The Piano?

732
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.416
No.

733
00:47:56.958 --> 00:47:58.583
-I don't know.

734
00:47:59.458 --> 00:48:00.875
I liked Bye Bye Birdie.

735
00:48:01.541 --> 00:48:04.291
Did you? Bye Bye Birdie the musical?

736
00:48:04.375 --> 00:48:05.708
It's for kids.

737
00:48:05.791 --> 00:48:07.041
Yeah.

738
00:48:07.125 --> 00:48:10.083
-Yeah. kids born in 1960.

739
00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:13.750
What about you busting out
the Jane Campion reference?

740
00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:16.583
My mom would be so proud of you.

741
00:48:16.666 --> 00:48:19.916
Yeah. well. when you don't sleep.
you watch a lot of movies.

742
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.208
-And eat a lot of pie…
-Mm-hmm.

743
00:48:21.291 --> 00:48:22.791
-…drink a lot of coffee…

744
00:48:22.875 --> 00:48:24.083
Two nocturnes.

745
00:48:24.958 --> 00:48:26.708
Guess that's why we're pals.

746
00:48:28.375 --> 00:48:29.291
Pals.

747
00:48:33.291 --> 00:48:36.083
But seriously. why don't you sleep?

748
00:48:37.458 --> 00:48:39.916
I'm just a night owl. I guess. you know?

749
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.666
What about you? Same question.

750
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:42.833
Same answer.

751
00:48:43.708 --> 00:48:45.791
Nocturne. night owl.

752
00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:50.833
Nah. You have a story. I can tell.

753
00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:57.750
If I had to pull it down.

754
00:48:58.708 --> 00:49:02.083
I guess it's
that when my parents were still married.

755
00:49:02.166 --> 00:49:06.000
they used to wait for me to fall asleep
before they would start fighting.

756
00:49:06.583 --> 00:49:12.708
And I thought if I didn't fall asleep.
they can't fight.

757
00:49:14.166 --> 00:49:16.166
I mean. I was wrong. obviously.

758
00:49:17.375 --> 00:49:18.958
I'm sorry. That's…

759
00:49:19.041 --> 00:49:20.833
No. please don't be.

760
00:49:20.916 --> 00:49:24.666
I'm not like one of those kids
who's defined by her parents' divorce.

761
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:28.333
If anything. my life was probably better
because they got divorced.

762
00:49:28.916 --> 00:49:30.750
Whose parents are still married anyway?

763
00:49:31.458 --> 00:49:32.375
Mine are.

764
00:49:32.958 --> 00:49:33.875
Right.

765
00:49:35.708 --> 00:49:38.541
But I mean. I'm sure
you had other stuff to deal with.

766
00:49:51.208 --> 00:49:53.708
Hi. what's up. everybody?
Um. my name's Eli Stock.

767
00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:56.000
That doesn't matter.
You don't need to know who I am.

768
00:49:56.083 --> 00:49:58.666
You know who this is right here.
Your boy Abe.

769
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.250
-You know him as Abeonimable.
-Abeominable.

770
00:50:02.458 --> 00:50:03.708
-Yes. sir.

771
00:50:03.791 --> 00:50:06.083
Did you do the 360 bar today?

772
00:50:06.166 --> 00:50:08.583
Yeah. did a 360 bar.
aka Truck Driver.

773
00:50:08.666 --> 00:50:10.666
-First try too. Nice. homie.
-First try.

774
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:13.666
-Almost flipped the pedal. but I saved it.
-You always fall first try.

775
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:15.583
Always.
Yeah. man. what's up with that?

776
00:50:15.666 --> 00:50:17.291
-Get out of here. bro.

777
00:50:17.375 --> 00:50:20.833
-What? I don't even fall half the time.
-Hey. be sure to check my boy out. okay?

778
00:50:20.916 --> 00:50:23.041
All right? He's. like. my best friend.

779
00:50:23.125 --> 00:50:24.750
-Yeah.
-His hair is disgusting.

780
00:50:24.833 --> 00:50:26.833
He's never washed it a single time.

781
00:50:26.916 --> 00:50:28.500
He's my homeboy. He's so cute.

782
00:50:29.666 --> 00:50:32.208
Big Abe. stop playing. man. Stop playing.

783
00:50:41.083 --> 00:50:43.750
Hey. everything okay?
Do you need anything?

784
00:50:43.833 --> 00:50:47.708
I'm trying to get her to take a bottle
so your dad can help with feedings.

785
00:50:47.791 --> 00:50:50.041
Hey. babe. I think she'll take this
more easily from you.

786
00:50:50.125 --> 00:50:53.583
When I'm here. she just…
she just wants the boob.

787
00:50:53.666 --> 00:50:56.708
Oh. honey. I wish I could.
but I was gonna take Auden to lunch.

788
00:50:56.791 --> 00:50:57.958
-What?
-Today?

789
00:50:58.041 --> 00:51:00.750
Yeah. Aren't you the one
that said we should spend time together?

790
00:51:00.833 --> 00:51:03.166
-Yeah. but I mean--
-So. what do you say?

791
00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:05.416
-Shrimp basket?
-Um…

792
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:08.166
Um…

793
00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:09.916
Great.

794
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.875
-Great.
-Okay.

795
00:51:10.958 --> 00:51:11.833
All right.

796
00:51:12.625 --> 00:51:15.375
Do you think it's okay
we left just like that?

797
00:51:15.458 --> 00:51:17.916
Heidi seemed a little. like. strung out.

798
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.250
No. she's fine. I think that's
just what new motherhood looks like.

799
00:51:21.333 --> 00:51:23.000
Was it like that for you and Mom?

800
00:51:23.083 --> 00:51:26.416
No. your… your mother
and Heidi are completely different.

801
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:30.083
As far as I can tell.
all women go nuts with a newborn.

802
00:51:30.166 --> 00:51:31.375
But men don't?

803
00:51:32.083 --> 00:51:34.958
I think that's why she's frustrated
about the book.

804
00:51:36.958 --> 00:51:39.833
It's like I told her
when she said she wanted to get pregnant.

805
00:51:39.916 --> 00:51:42.833
I only have these three months
before classes start to get it finished.

806
00:51:42.916 --> 00:51:44.916
We just gotta put our head down
and get through it.

807
00:51:45.416 --> 00:51:48.416
Yeah. How is it coming along?

808
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:50.125
It's grueling.

809
00:51:50.208 --> 00:51:52.750
Very painful.
difficult. but beautiful too.

810
00:51:52.833 --> 00:51:55.625
As you know from Narwhal.
a lot of my work deals with

811
00:51:55.708 --> 00:51:58.833
undiscovered trauma
that we carry from our parents.

812
00:51:58.916 --> 00:52:02.750
Auden. you're so lucky you don't have
that to deal with. at least not from me.

813
00:52:03.875 --> 00:52:04.916
Right.

814
00:52:06.541 --> 00:52:09.916
Hey. um. you know.
I'd love it if you read the draft.

815
00:52:10.958 --> 00:52:12.291
You want me to do that?

816
00:52:12.375 --> 00:52:15.333
Yeah. it'd be great to have
a young person's perspective.

817
00:52:15.875 --> 00:52:18.916
You know how youth-obsessed
our culture is these days.

818
00:52:22.208 --> 00:52:24.208
You just brought that with you to lunch?

819
00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:26.750
-I mean. a brilliant young person…
-Right.

820
00:52:26.833 --> 00:52:29.916
Of course. I carry it with me everywhere.
You think you can read it?

821
00:52:31.625 --> 00:52:35.000
Yeah. I mean. of course. I'd love to. Dad.

822
00:52:35.083 --> 00:52:35.916
Excellent.

823
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.083
If you can get me notes by Friday.
that would be really great.

824
00:52:53.875 --> 00:52:56.041
-My dad's book.
-Looks long.

825
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.541
Three years ago. I would have been
so excited to have him trust me with it.

826
00:53:01.208 --> 00:53:04.916
but I just realized I have
absolutely no desire to read this.

827
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:10.291
My dad's always trying
to get me to go fishing with him.

828
00:53:10.375 --> 00:53:12.333
My dad would probably use me as bait.

829
00:53:13.375 --> 00:53:15.208

So…

858
00:55:41.083 --> 00:55:43.333
we crossed trespassing off the list.

859
00:55:44.916 --> 00:55:46.375
You ever been night swimming?

860
00:55:51.666 --> 00:55:53.791
Maybe trespassing is enough for one night.

861
00:55:56.666 --> 00:55:57.625
Okay.

862
00:56:12.875 --> 00:56:15.750
Um. thanks. That was fun.

863
00:56:15.833 --> 00:56:16.750
Yeah.

864
00:56:19.791 --> 00:56:22.875
Next time. we should. uh.
teach you how to ride a bike.

865
00:56:25.208 --> 00:56:27.458
I already told you.
I know how to ride a bike.

866
00:56:28.666 --> 00:56:30.250
Mm-hmm. You sure?

867
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:32.750
Yes.

868
00:56:33.583 --> 00:56:38.083
My dad taught me
as all children's fathers teach them.

869
00:56:38.166 --> 00:56:40.500
I'm not even trying
to make it a whole thing.

870
00:56:40.583 --> 00:56:44.416
I'm just saying that if
for whatever reason you don't know.

871
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:48.500
you know. family stuff or whatever.
you should really learn.

872
00:56:49.166 --> 00:56:50.916
It's like the… It's the best.

873
00:56:54.166 --> 00:56:55.125
Thank you.

874
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.750
But no. that's not on my quest list.

875
00:57:02.083 --> 00:57:06.375
But maybe it's on yours?

876
00:57:08.875 --> 00:57:11.041
Seriously. what would be
on your quest list?

877
00:57:12.291 --> 00:57:14.041
Um…

878
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:19.291
I used to wanna move to Barcelona.

879
00:57:21.458 --> 00:57:23.250
Uh. but that's never gonna happen.

880
00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:26.166
Why not?

881
00:57:26.958 --> 00:57:32.541
I only wanted to go because
a bunch of pro BMXers live out there.

882
00:57:33.208 --> 00:57:36.000
Pro BMXers like you?

883
00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:39.583
Isn't that what you told me before?

884
00:57:39.666 --> 00:57:42.416
That you made a career out of bike stuff?

885
00:57:43.041 --> 00:57:46.333
Yeah. Yeah. but. you know. I'm retired.

886
00:57:47.125 --> 00:57:49.041
-You're retired?
-Yeah.

887
00:57:49.625 --> 00:57:50.541
At 20?

888
00:57:52.916 --> 00:57:59.083
I mean. look. the pro scene.
and the traveling for competitions.

889
00:57:59.166 --> 00:58:02.416
and putting it all out there
just doesn't interest me anymore.

890
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.291
You know? I kind of grew out of it.
I fix bikes now.

891
00:58:06.333 --> 00:58:07.666
I don't need to ride 'em.

892
00:58:09.166 --> 00:58:10.833
But you do ride them.

893
00:58:24.958 --> 00:58:26.750
Uh. this is your house.

894
00:58:29.125 --> 00:58:30.541
Yes. it is.

895
00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:33.208
Um…

896
00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.291
-Okay. thank you.
-Yeah.

897
00:58:38.541 --> 00:58:40.458

-Here he comes.

00:59:46.958 --> 00:59:49.541
-Auden. are you okay? Auden. hey.

913
00:59:49.625 --> 00:59:51.458
That was so good.

914
00:59:54.208 --> 00:59:56.666
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

915
00:59:58.208 --> 00:59:59.166
I'm sorry.

916
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:01.833
Is everything okay?

917
01:00:01.916 --> 01:00:04.333
I'm sorry. That was stupid.

918
01:00:06.125 --> 01:00:10.000
Eli. is… is there something
you wanna talk about?

919
01:00:10.083 --> 01:00:13.083
No. no. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

920
01:00:23.875 --> 01:00:27.416
Oh. good. you're here.
We need to have an intervention.

921
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:30.125
You sneak out of here
every night to go hang out with Eli.

922
01:00:30.208 --> 01:00:32.208
and you never tell us anything about it.

923
01:00:32.916 --> 01:00:33.916
That's not true.

924
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.250
The bare minimum.
that's what we get from you.

925
01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:39.458
We have no deets.
A girl can't live without deets.

926
01:00:39.958 --> 01:00:43.041
I'm sorry. Leah. I don't know
what you want me to tell you.

927
01:00:43.625 --> 01:00:44.833
We're friends.

928
01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:46.250
Are you sure about that?

929
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.125
-I don't know. He's confusing.
-Okay. see?

930
01:00:50.208 --> 01:00:51.375
This is why you need us

931
01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:54.250
to observe the two of you together
and tell you what's going on.

932
01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:58.750
-Where?
-HDP. tomorrow. for the Fourth.

933
01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:00.583
-HDP?
-He'll know what it means.

934
01:01:00.666 --> 01:01:02.625
Yeah. Eli used to love hot dog parties.

935
01:01:02.708 --> 01:01:04.958
Wallace's parents go out of town
every year on the Fourth.

936
01:01:05.041 --> 01:01:06.500
and we take over their house.

937
01:01:06.583 --> 01:01:09.125
We didn't come up with the name.
which I'll grant you is terrible.

938
01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:12.750
The name doesn't matter.
What matters is you showing up with Eli

939
01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:15.791
so that. as your friends.
we can assess the situation.

940
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.166
Can I admit something to you guys?

941
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:24.666
I've never really had
friends like this before.

942
01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:28.500
See. you say that. but I don't get it.

943
01:01:28.583 --> 01:01:31.500
I mean. there were people at our school
way more awkward than you.

944
01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:32.791
and even they had friends.

945
01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:34.958
-I mean. look at Esther.

946
01:01:35.041 --> 01:01:38.916
She says that because she lives in fear
of the day I realize I'm too cool for her.

947
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.375
Oh. yeah. because wearing
fishnet stockings as arm warmers

948
01:01:42.458 --> 01:01:43.875
is so cool.

949
01:01:43.958 --> 01:01:46.291
-I did that one time. and I stand by it.
-Guys.

950
01:01:46.375 --> 01:01:48.291
Auden. Focus.

951
01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:50.541
You were saying?

952
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:52.041
I don't know.

953
01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:56.000
If I'm being honest.
maybe without realizing it.

954
01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:59.208
I think I push people away.

955
01:02:00.208 --> 01:02:02.666
I think sometimes I come off
as a little intense.

956
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:05.916
What?

957
01:02:07.416 --> 01:02:10.458
We're not laughing at you.
It's just that it makes so much sense.

958
01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:12.916
Like how you were standoffish at first.

959
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.833
We thought you hated us.

960
01:02:22.125 --> 01:02:23.583
-Hey.
-Hi.

961
01:02:23.666 --> 01:02:24.958
-What's up?
-Oh…

962
01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:27.375
You're good.
It's not gonna hit you. Come here.

963
01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:35.625
So I have a request for the quest.

964
01:02:36.208 --> 01:02:37.916
A request for the quest?

965
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.833
Amazing. Lay it on me.

966
01:02:42.041 --> 01:02:43.291
HDP.

967
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.375
Eli…

968
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.416
Sorry. Uh. I just… It's nothing personal.

969
01:02:55.125 --> 01:02:57.416
Um. I just don't like parties.

970
01:02:59.416 --> 01:03:01.125
Anymore you mean?

971
01:03:02.625 --> 01:03:04.208
You don't like them anymore?

972
01:03:09.041 --> 01:03:10.458
Uh. you know about Abe.

973
01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:18.208
-You were offering me pity friendship.
-What? No. no. Eli.

974
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:20.916
No.

975
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.625
What happened to Abe.
it… it wasn't your fault.

976
01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:27.583
It wasn't my fault?

977
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.958
-It wasn't. and I--
-Hold on. Hold on. Are… are you serious?

978
01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:37.125
Auden. do you why know I liked you?
You didn't say stupid shit like that.

979
01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:41.000
-What does… what does that even mean?
-I didn't say stupid stuff.

980
01:03:41.875 --> 01:03:43.375
Look. I'm sorry. Uh…

981
01:03:44.916 --> 01:03:50.666
You should go to the party and have fun.
but I. uh. I can't. so… I'm sorry.

982
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:52.250
Wait. Eli--

983
01:03:58.166 --> 01:04:00.875
Hi. Auden. it's your mother.

984
01:04:00.958 --> 01:04:04.041
Just calling to check in
and see how you're blossoming--

985
01:04:05.708 --> 01:04:07.375
Auden. it's Mom.

986
01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:09.583
I guess I'm to understand
that you're very busy

987
01:04:09.666 --> 01:04:12.000
going tanning
and getting highlights. but--

988
01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.000
Auden. your mother.

989
01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:17.708
I don't know what I did
that was so horrible

990
01:04:17.791 --> 01:04:20.041
that you feel the need to ignore me.

991
01:04:20.125 --> 01:04:23.041
but I suppose
this break was coming eventually.

992
01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:26.500
It always does.
C'est la vie. c'est la vie.

993
01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:39.791
Okay. So exciting.

994
01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:45.750
Is it too much to make an American flag
out of berries on top of the cheesecake?

995
01:04:46.541 --> 01:04:47.708
-Uh…
-Oh my God!

996
01:04:47.791 --> 01:04:50.708
I just love the Fourth of July
so freaking much!

997
01:04:50.791 --> 01:04:53.958
It's probably my favorite holiday
because summer's my favorite season.

998
01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:56.166
Oh. are you coming with.
or do you have plans?

999
01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.500
-I… I don't--
-I will not be offended if you have plans.

1000
01:04:58.583 --> 01:05:01.791
I didn't wanna hang out
with my parents when I was 18. Obviously.

1001
01:05:02.583 --> 01:05:05.333
-Well. there is a party.
-Oh my God.

1002
01:05:05.416 --> 01:05:07.375
Do you wanna borrow something festive?

1003
01:05:07.458 --> 01:05:10.208
Hi. Heidi. it's me.
your stepdaughter. Auden.

1004
01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:13.458
Well. I may have laid
something out on your bed already.

1005
01:05:13.541 --> 01:05:14.625
Oh God.

1006
01:05:15.583 --> 01:05:17.791
Don't be scared. I know you.

1007
01:05:18.291 --> 01:05:19.541
Oh no.

1008
01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:22.375
Auden.
you're a firework. baby.

1009
01:05:40.041 --> 01:05:44.333
Hey. guys. Cala's been texting me
exclusively in haikus.

1010
01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:46.541
What do you think this means?

1011
01:05:47.208 --> 01:05:49.208
"Meat? I'm a vegan."

1012
01:05:49.291 --> 01:05:51.500
"Don't your friends shave their armpits?"

1013
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.333
"My AC works fine."

1014
01:05:54.333 --> 01:05:57.250
I don't think it's that hard to decipher.
She's not coming.

1015
01:05:57.333 --> 01:06:00.458
-Do you not shave your armpits?
-Yo. Auden. over here.

1016
01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:03.750
-Uh-oh. no Eli.
-Don't make it a thing.

1017
01:06:03.833 --> 01:06:05.250
-Hey!
-Hi.

1018
01:06:05.333 --> 01:06:07.125
-Come on. everyone's outside.
-Okay.

1019
01:06:07.208 --> 01:06:09.708
-I'm so glad you came.

1020
01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:13.375
Oh. dude. what about the Spin Doctors?

1021
01:06:14.375 --> 01:06:16.750
-Huh?
-Dude. that's already a band.

1022
01:06:16.833 --> 01:06:17.916
Really? No way.

1023
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.958
Yeah. dude. "Two Princes."
It's a classic. What?

1024
01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:27.208
Okay. how about this?

1025
01:06:31.625 --> 01:06:32.625
Pedal Posse.

1026
01:06:33.458 --> 01:06:34.875
That is terrible.

1027
01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:36.791
Maggie. hey. Come. sit here.

1028
01:06:37.458 --> 01:06:40.000

-Hey. I need to lay down.

1029
01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:42.166
-Please. Make yourself comfortable.
-Okay.

1030
01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:45.125
Okay. guys. Bike shop name ideas. Go.

1031
01:06:45.208 --> 01:06:47.875
I hate when people say "go"
when they want you to answer a question.

1032
01:06:47.958 --> 01:06:49.375
What's wrong with The Bike Shop?

1033
01:06:49.458 --> 01:06:51.458
Oh. that was only
supposed to be temporary.

1034
01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:52.625

1035
01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:55.125

blew the sign down last fall.

1036
01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:58.666
-Yeah.
-Yo. Dub H. do you believe in aliens?

1037
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:01.916
Uh. me?

1038
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.416
Yeah. Dub H. like your name.

1039
01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.916
-You know who W.H. Auden is?
-Don't mind her.

1040
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.666
She thinks she's the only person
who's ever read a book before.

1041
01:07:12.291 --> 01:07:14.833
It's chill. but you still need
to answer the question.

1042
01:07:14.916 --> 01:07:17.666
Um. I think aliens probably do exist.

1043
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:19.750
but not in the way
we usually think of them.

1044
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:22.291
Yeah. I knew it.

1045
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.208
You know what?
We need to chill on the bike shop name.

1099
01:13:45.958 --> 01:13:49.583
What happened is. I don't… I don't know.

1100
01:13:49.666 --> 01:13:53.375
She's crazy. At least with your mom.
when she was upset. I could tell.

1101
01:13:54.416 --> 01:13:58.250
With Heidi. one minute you're thinking
everything's hunky-dory. and the next.

1102
01:13:58.833 --> 01:14:03.000
you're sitting at a coffee shop waiting
for a room to be ready at a beach motel.

1103
01:14:03.083 --> 01:14:07.000
Come on. Dad. Even I could tell
that everything wasn't hunky-dory.

1104
01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:09.625
You're a woman.
Uh. women are more intuitive.

1105
01:14:10.125 --> 01:14:13.000
If one of your characters said that.
you would say that was lazy--

1106
01:14:13.083 --> 01:14:14.791
Yeah. so I knew she was tense.

1107
01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:16.875
And tired? Sure. But this?

1108
01:14:16.958 --> 01:14:19.750
Auden. this is something else entirely.
She's. like. certifiable.

1109
01:14:19.833 --> 01:14:22.000
-I don't know how to handle it.
-Whoa. So… so what?

1110
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:23.958
So you're gonna quit?

1111
01:14:25.333 --> 01:14:28.333
You're gonna quit on your family. again?

1112
01:14:29.208 --> 01:14:30.583
Because it's hard?

1113
01:14:31.625 --> 01:14:36.541
Is that what you think I did. Auden?
That I… that I quit on you?

1114
01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:41.250
I don't know what I think.

1115
01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:46.208
The truth is. and I'm telling you
because I respect you

1116
01:14:46.291 --> 01:14:47.791
and I think you'll understand…

1117
01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:55.333
sometimes I wonder whether
I was really meant to be a husband

1118
01:14:55.416 --> 01:14:56.541
or a father.

1119
01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:01.833
You know what. Dad?

1120
01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:04.333
I take it back.

1121
01:15:05.458 --> 01:15:07.000
I don't think you quit on me.

1122
01:15:09.333 --> 01:15:10.875
I think you didn't even try.

1123
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.041
Come on.

1124
01:15:15.125 --> 01:15:16.416
Come on? Okay.

1125
01:15:26.041 --> 01:15:27.041
Heidi.

1126
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:30.416
Oh. hi. Auden.

1127
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:32.875
It's…

1128
01:15:34.166 --> 01:15:35.583
it's nothing. really.

1129
01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:39.416
Yesterday was the Fourth. you know.

1130
01:15:40.458 --> 01:15:42.041
It's a holiday.

1131
01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:48.041
And holidays are for families.

1132
01:15:48.541 --> 01:15:50.708
When you're married. and you have a baby…

1133
01:15:54.875 --> 01:15:56.458
…you do that stuff. you know?

1134
01:15:57.833 --> 01:15:59.500
You go to the barbecue.

1135
01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:07.166
But then he says. "You're always talking
about how tired you are…

1136
01:16:08.833 --> 01:16:11.208
…and now you wanna go to a party?"
And I said something like.

1137
01:16:11.291 --> 01:16:14.791
"I have given you
the whole summer off from being a father."

1138
01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:18.625
"All I'm asking for
is one fucking picnic."

1139
01:16:20.958 --> 01:16:21.958
And I just…

1140
01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.833
It's just too much. you know?

1141
01:16:29.125 --> 01:16:30.750
It's all just a little too much.

1142
01:16:33.625 --> 01:16:34.791
I'll be right back.

1143
01:16:53.083 --> 01:16:54.666
-Hello?
-Hi. Mom.

1144
01:16:55.625 --> 01:16:56.625
It's me.

1145
01:16:59.041 --> 01:17:00.208
I need your help.

1146
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:23.916
Hey.

1147
01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:25.958
There you are.

1148
01:17:26.458 --> 01:17:27.333
Hi.

1149
01:17:29.791 --> 01:17:31.083
What are you doing here?

1150
01:17:32.458 --> 01:17:35.708
You disappeared.
So I thought I'd come find you.

1151
01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:39.291
-Oh. yeah.

1152
01:17:39.375 --> 01:17:40.541
I'm sorry.

1153
01:17:41.541 --> 01:17:44.416
I. uh…
I went to get us coffees and then I…

1154
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.041
Uh… I don't know.

1155
01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:52.375
Whose bike is that?

1156
01:17:54.541 --> 01:17:56.875
-You mean this bike here?
-Yeah.

1157
01:17:58.083 --> 01:17:59.083
It's yours.

1158
01:18:00.833 --> 01:18:02.250
-What?
-Yeah.

1159
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:06.041
It's yours. I just fixed it up for you.
It's in great condition.

1160
01:18:06.125 --> 01:18:09.458
It's a beach cruiser.
so it's. like. super simple to learn on.

1161
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:14.458
Well. we've been over this.

1162
01:18:14.541 --> 01:18:17.458
I don't need to learn how to ride a bike.

1163
01:18:17.541 --> 01:18:19.875
-I know how to ride a bike.
-Great.

1164
01:18:20.375 --> 01:18:23.291
That's even better.
Then we can just go for a ride.

1165
01:18:25.708 --> 01:18:27.875
I'm not in the mood to do that right now.

1166
01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:28.875
How about this?

1167
01:18:29.541 --> 01:18:33.166
If you know how to ride. show me.

1168
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:34.625
It'll be fun. I promise.

1169
01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:39.416
Well. this doesn't feel fun.
This feels like a… like a weird test.

1170
01:18:40.625 --> 01:18:43.666
Auden. you don't have to be embarrassed.

1171
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:45.541
Oh. I'm not embarrassed.

1172
01:18:46.416 --> 01:18:50.750
I'm frustrated that you keep harassing me
about this stupid bike.

1173
01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:59.750
Hey. what's up with you?

1174
01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:08.500
Did you ever think that
it might make me feel like. I don't know.

1175
01:19:09.333 --> 01:19:11.083
like a damaged loser?

1176
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:14.208
That I can't do this thing that
most kids' dads taught them

1177
01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:15.541
when they were five?

1178
01:19:16.083 --> 01:19:18.375
Auden. I thought that was the whole point.

1179
01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:21.958
To humiliate me?

1180
01:19:22.666 --> 01:19:25.375
No. obviously-- No. to do the quest.

1181
01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:29.833
Eli. come on. the quest isn't real.

1182
01:19:29.916 --> 01:19:32.750
The quest… It's a joke. It's…

1183
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:36.916
Just like this summer.

1184
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.083
you've been pushing me
to be this whole new version of myself.

1185
01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:44.375
-But you're too scared to be who you are.
-Okay. and who am I. Auden?

1186
01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:47.916
Who exactly do you think I am?

1187
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
You tell me.

1188
01:19:49.083 --> 01:19:52.416
Are… are you gonna be someone
who ambles around Colby.

1189
01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.041
working in the back of a bike shop?

1190
01:19:54.125 --> 01:19:55.208
Ambles around. okay.

1191
01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:58.458
Or are you going to ride
professionally again. or move to Europe.

1192
01:19:58.541 --> 01:19:59.500
or go to Barcelona?

1193
01:19:59.583 --> 01:20:02.708
-That's what you were saying.
-I think I'm understanding you perfectly.

1194
01:20:02.791 --> 01:20:03.750
I get it.

1195
01:20:04.416 --> 01:20:06.333
What… what do you get? I don't understand.

1196
01:20:06.416 --> 01:20:08.875
Uh. let's see. Colby sucks.

1197
01:20:08.958 --> 01:20:11.708
-And Auden West is too good for Colby.
-That's not fair.

1198
01:20:11.791 --> 01:20:14.125
And now you're freaking out
because last night.

1199
01:20:14.208 --> 01:20:16.666
you… you spent the whole night
with some washed-up loser

1200
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:18.833
who isn't even worthy of you. I got you.

1201
01:20:21.833 --> 01:20:24.166
You know. every time we try
and talk about you.

1202
01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:25.750
you turn it back on me.

1203
01:20:26.625 --> 01:20:29.541
-Why do you think that is?
-I think you're the one with the problem.

1204
01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:31.083
-I'm the one with the problem?
-Yeah.

1205
01:20:33.291 --> 01:20:36.041
Do you really think Abe
would have wanted you to quit?

1206
01:20:36.791 --> 01:20:38.625
I'm not talking about that with you.

1207
01:20:39.291 --> 01:20:41.666
Yep. fine. Deflect.

1208
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.666
You know. I have enough
of my own stuff to deal with right now.

1209
01:20:47.166 --> 01:20:50.625
I can't also be the thing you use
to avoid thinking about yourself.

1210
01:20:54.791 --> 01:20:58.166
I'm not Abe. Eli. I can't be your do-over.

1211
01:20:59.375 --> 01:21:00.416
You're right.

1212
01:21:02.208 --> 01:21:03.041
You can't.

1213
01:21:16.666 --> 01:21:20.041
But it's just so hard for me
'cause I don't have a lot of help.

1214
01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:21.708
and it's totally stupid.

1215
01:21:21.791 --> 01:21:23.916
-You've been saying that.
-Oh. honey. you're not stupid.

1216
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.250
You're very intelligent.
I just would like to ask you.

1217
01:21:27.333 --> 01:21:32.166
what makes you think that his needs
are more important than yours?

1218
01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:34.375
It's a… it's a powerful thing
that you've done.

1219
01:21:34.458 --> 01:21:38.041
to stand up to him
and… and to say. "I… I deserve better."

1220
01:21:38.125 --> 01:21:40.791
-Yeah.
-You know. and that's motherhood.

1221
01:21:40.875 --> 01:21:42.250
-That means so much to me.

1222
01:21:42.333 --> 01:21:44.833

I think so. Your father came home.
and they're talking.

01:22:56.375 --> 01:22:57.375
Oh.

1242
01:22:58.041 --> 01:22:59.666
Um. well. that's good.

1243
01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:04.500
I don't know what you said to him. Auden.
but whatever it was. he heard you.

1244
01:23:05.916 --> 01:23:07.458
-He told you that?
-Mm-hmm.

1245
01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:11.250
You guys talked about it? About me?

1246
01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:15.166
Look. Auden. I. uh…

1247
01:23:16.375 --> 01:23:17.750
I need to talk to you.

1248
01:23:25.791 --> 01:23:29.083
I know you went through
a lot with the divorce.

1249
01:23:29.666 --> 01:23:30.916
And perhaps…

1250
01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:34.250
I relied on you too much.

1251
01:23:34.791 --> 01:23:36.500
I expected too much of you.

1252
01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:40.041
But I liked that you expected a lot of me.

1253
01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:42.208
I expected a lot of myself.

1254
01:23:42.833 --> 01:23:44.583
I don't mean that. sweetheart.

1255
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:46.375
I mean…

1256
01:23:47.958 --> 01:23:50.416
that I expected you to always be mine.

1257
01:23:51.666 --> 01:23:55.416
That I wouldn't have to share you.
and that's not fair.

1258
01:23:56.708 --> 01:23:58.583
When you came down here.

1259
01:23:59.916 --> 01:24:02.291
I felt like you didn't need me anymore.

1260
01:24:04.125 --> 01:24:05.458
And to be blunt.

1261
01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:08.000
I was jealous.

1262
01:24:09.208 --> 01:24:10.791
I'll always need you. Mom.

1263
01:24:12.375 --> 01:24:15.125
I just need other people too.

1264
01:24:15.208 --> 01:24:16.625
Of course you do.

1265
01:24:17.625 --> 01:24:18.458
I guess…

1266
01:24:20.041 --> 01:24:23.000
I just wish
that some things had been easier.

1267
01:24:23.541 --> 01:24:25.833
Me too.

1268
01:24:25.916 --> 01:24:27.375
Oh God.

1269
01:24:29.958 --> 01:24:31.166
Aw. Mom.

1270
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:14.958
-Hello?

1271
01:25:16.416 --> 01:25:18.583
-Oh. hi.
-Hi.

1272
01:25:19.166 --> 01:25:20.041
You did yoga?

1273
01:25:20.125 --> 01:25:23.666
Seventy-five blissful minutes.

1274
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:26.208
Wow. Where's Thisbe?

1275
01:25:26.291 --> 01:25:29.291
Your dad took her for a walk on the beach.

1276
01:25:29.375 --> 01:25:32.125
Said it was a great way
for him to clear his head.

1277
01:25:32.208 --> 01:25:33.791
-Wow.

1278
01:25:34.583 --> 01:25:35.500
Yeah.

1279
01:25:37.375 --> 01:25:43.416
Hey. I never got the chance to thank you
for asking your mom to come out here.

1280
01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:47.041
Oh. I thought you might be mad at me.

1281
01:25:47.125 --> 01:25:49.916
No. No. honey. Not at all.

1282
01:25:51.166 --> 01:25:52.541
Actually. it was because of her

1283
01:25:52.625 --> 01:25:56.500
that your dad and I had the most honest
conversation that we've had in months.

1284
01:25:58.375 --> 01:26:02.791
It's funny. isn't it?
You look at your life. and you think.

1285
01:26:03.541 --> 01:26:06.708
one decision.
and it all would have been different.

1286
01:26:07.416 --> 01:26:09.125
You mean. this stuff with my dad?

1287
01:26:09.833 --> 01:26:14.000
Actually. I was thinking about
if I never moved back from New York.

1288
01:26:14.083 --> 01:26:15.541
You lived in New York?

1289
01:26:15.625 --> 01:26:18.208
Yeah. I did.

1290
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:19.708
After business school.

1291
01:26:20.958 --> 01:26:23.416
I was gonna open up a boutique
there on the Lower East Side.

1292
01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.166
but I decided I would wait

1293
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:28.125
until something came on the market
that I truly loved.

1294
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
And it did.

1295
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.208
Clementine's.

1296
01:26:32.291 --> 01:26:35.375
So you chose Colby over New York.

1297
01:26:36.125 --> 01:26:39.833
and you don't. like. regret it at all?

1298
01:26:40.625 --> 01:26:41.541
Hmm.

1299
01:26:47.958 --> 01:26:50.833
Life is long. Auden.

1300
01:26:52.125 --> 01:26:53.750
It'd be boring if we had to stay

1301
01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:57.041
the same versions of ourselves
the whole time. Don't you think?

1302
01:26:59.125 --> 01:27:00.750
-Yeah.

to teach you how to do this?

01:30:58.375 --> 01:31:00.416
Okay. but what if he thinks
it's weird that I'm here?

1356
01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:04.583
Oh yeah. 'Cause guys hate when girls
they like show up to watch them win.

1357
01:31:06.083 --> 01:31:07.666
-Go!
-Can you go already?

1358
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:09.291
-Okay. okay. okay. okay.
-So go.

1359
01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:11.875

-Go on!.

1360
01:31:11.958 --> 01:31:13.416
-Go!
-I'm going.

1361
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:14.958

1362
01:31:16.666 --> 01:31:17.583

1363
01:31:18.958 --> 01:31:19.916
-Hi.
-Hey.

1364
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.208
-Hey.
-Hi.

1365
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:23.500
You were. um. so good.

1366
01:31:23.583 --> 01:31:25.750
Thanks. Thank you.

1367
01:31:25.833 --> 01:31:28.500
Um. do you wanna talk over here. maybe?

1368
01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:29.416
Yeah.

1369
01:31:31.125 --> 01:31:32.000
Yeah.

1370
01:31:32.791 --> 01:31:34.416
-Mm-mm.
-Ooh!

1371
01:31:37.083 --> 01:31:39.416
-So. Eli.
-So. Auden.

1372
01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:40.833
Sorry.

1373
01:31:41.458 --> 01:31:42.500
You… you go first.

1374
01:31:44.625 --> 01:31:49.000
I'm really sorry about what I said
the other day. I didn't mean it.

1375
01:31:49.083 --> 01:31:51.750
You did. but It's okay.
You know. I needed to hear it.

1376
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:54.833
Look.

1377
01:31:58.291 --> 01:32:00.041
I miss the hell out of Abe.

1378
01:32:02.208 --> 01:32:05.583
I thought that
if I stopped thinking about it and…

1379
01:32:07.458 --> 01:32:10.125
if I gave up doing all the things he loved
that it would just go away.

1380
01:32:10.208 --> 01:32:12.083
but it only made it worse

1381
01:32:12.166 --> 01:32:13.208
'cause. you know…

1382
01:32:14.791 --> 01:32:17.416
…all the things he loved
were the things I loved too.

1383
01:32:22.625 --> 01:32:24.333
He was just the best. man.

1384
01:32:24.416 --> 01:32:26.166
I loved that kid so much.

1385
01:32:30.458 --> 01:32:32.625
I wish you two could have met.
He would have loved you.

1386
01:32:33.416 --> 01:32:34.500
So do I.

1387
01:32:35.708 --> 01:32:37.791
And I'm… I'm sorry too.

1388
01:32:37.875 --> 01:32:41.458
You know. if I pressured you
into doing anything you didn't wanna do--

1389
01:32:41.541 --> 01:32:42.833
Oh. no. no. no. I…

1390
01:32:44.666 --> 01:32:47.083
I wanted to do everything I did.

1391
01:32:48.125 --> 01:32:49.041
Okay. good.

1392
01:32:49.625 --> 01:32:52.666
That morning. me freaking out.

1393
01:32:53.458 --> 01:32:59.166
it wasn't about you.
or us. or the night before.

1394
01:33:02.833 --> 01:33:06.083
It was just some stuff with my parents.

1395
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:11.000
Turns out I'm not as over
all of it as I thought.

1396
01:33:13.083 --> 01:33:14.041
It's okay.

1397
01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:16.125
I get it.

1398
01:33:19.375 --> 01:33:22.291
Okay. well. enjoy tonight.

1399
01:33:23.291 --> 01:33:25.208
-You earned it.
-Thanks.

1400
01:34:06.166 --> 01:34:07.916
You know. it's the craziest thing.

1401
01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.416
Both my girls slept through the night.

1402
01:34:25.958 --> 01:34:30.375
Auden. do you know anything
about that boy on our lawn in a tuxedo?

1403
01:34:47.791 --> 01:34:48.666
Oh.

1404

Hey yourself.

1406
01:34:55.416 --> 01:35:00.208
You know. we. uh. came up
with a new name for the bike shop.

1407
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:03.000
"Abe's Bikes."

1408
01:35:04.083 --> 01:35:05.166
What do you think?

1409
01:35:06.125 --> 01:35:07.125
I love it.

1410
01:35:07.833 --> 01:35:11.125
Okay. good.
'cause you gave me the idea. so…

1411
01:35:15.208 --> 01:35:16.500
Nice tux.

1412
01:35:17.208 --> 01:35:19.125
-Oh. this old thing?

1413
01:35:19.875 --> 01:35:21.791
Where you goin' all dressed up?

1414
01:35:22.791 --> 01:35:26.500
I don't know. I was thinking
maybe I'd skip rocks. drink Cokes.

1415
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:32.000
Why. is that something
you'd be interested in?

1416
01:35:33.125 --> 01:35:37.708
I mean. I'd love to.
but I don't have anything to wear.

1417
01:35:39.125 --> 01:35:40.000
Right.

1418
01:35:40.916 --> 01:35:44.500
It's a real shame you didn't bring
that dress to Colby with you.

1419
