00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:32.250
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of my last and greatest wish.</i>

5
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.583
<i>A dream I want to share with my son.</i>

6
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:48.541
<i>That's what this notebook is for.</i>

7
00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:07.875
<i>Hopefully. for him to learn</i>
<i>how important it is to be yourself</i>

8
00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:10.500
<i>and for him to know his story.</i>

9
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.083
<i>I just hope I can finish it.</i>

10
00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.333
This way. please.

11
00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:28.250
Excuse me.

12
00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.916
Wait in the waiting room.
They'll look for you.

13
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.208
Yes. here's her bag…

14
00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:00.958
Thanks.

15
00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:12.250
Hey. Fede. I don't want to stay here.

16
00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:15.166
If the insurance people don't listen.
they must give us a room.

17
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.166
Fine. but call them and drive them crazy.

18
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.708
It's a six-month treatment.
They must give me a bed.

19
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:22.708
I'll drive them crazy until they listen.

20
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:25.250
-Drive them really crazy.
-Yes. Done.

21
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:29.208
-Did you talk to Tomy?
-Yes. He was just waking up.

22
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:31.416
I told your dad I would pick him up later.

23
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.458
-Did you talk to the doctors?
-I did.

24
00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:35.916
And?

25
00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:40.333
They said they'll give you
"tose" or "tilose." I don't know.

26
00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:42.250
Something for bowel obstruction.

27
00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:43.791
So I have to stay here?

28
00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:45.791
Until it works. I guess.

29
00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:50.333
Come on. Fede. I'm not stupid.
I had my ovaries removed. not my brain.

30
00:02:50.416 --> 00:02:53.833
Come on. They wouldn't hospitalize me
just to make me shit. What is it?

31
00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:00.291
Well.

32
00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:04.125
<i>"We have to talk"</i>
<i>is always followed by something terrible.</i>

33
00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:06.250
<i>but not as terrible as that one time.</i>

34
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.333
<i>Two days after the surgery</i>
<i>that took my uterus. my ovaries.</i>

35
00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:15.625
<i>and several other things to be tested.</i>
<i>I knew something was very wrong.</i>

36
00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:18.750
<i>But not even the surgeon</i>
<i>dared to tell me.</i>

37
00:03:19.708 --> 00:03:22.791
<i>Everything feels</i>
<i>more intense and vivid when you are dying.</i>

38
00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:26.458
<i>You want to feel. taste. and love.</i>

39
00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:29.458
<i>But. at the same time.</i>
<i>that intensity is unsustainable.</i>

40
00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:31.291
<i>No ill body can stand it.</i>

41
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:35.458
<i>So. you have to look for ways</i>
<i>to entertain. amuse and distract yourself.</i>

42
00:03:35.541 --> 00:03:38.500
<i>That’s where social media comes in.</i>
<i>or rather Twitter.</i>

43
00:03:38.583 --> 00:03:41.208
<i>where you can be dramatic</i>
<i>or argue for hours</i>

44
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:43.416
<i>about whether to use</i>
<i>tampons or pads. sure.</i>

45
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.041
<i>But also where I can share</i>
<i>what's happening to me.</i>

46
00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:48.041
<i>Having cancer is like having the flu.</i>

47
00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:51.625
<i>It's nothing to be ashamed of.</i>
<i>but it’s a thousand times worse. </i>

48
00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:54.541
<i>And not talking about it</i>
<i>is being like those who just say.</i>

49
00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:56.666
<i>"It's a long and painful illness."</i>

50
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:07.666
<i>As soon as I posted it.</i>
<i>I got a huge amount of supportive notes</i>

51
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.416
<i>from people I don't even know.</i>

52
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.041
<i>Now. no offense to anyone.</i>

53
00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:13.750
<i>I'll tell you the phrase I hate hearing.</i>

54
00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:15.458
<i>"Everything will be all right."</i>

55
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:16.958
<i>All right my ass.</i>

56
00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:19.208
<i>Telling a cancer patient</i>
<i>everything will be fine</i>

57
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.791
<i>is like telling someone</i>
<i>who's about to cross the desert</i>

58
00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.041
<i>that at the very end. there's an oasis.</i>

59
00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:25.958
He goes to school tomorrow.

60
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:30.708
Okay. let's get on the bed.

61
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:33.541
Easy.

62
00:04:37.458 --> 00:04:38.291
There.

63
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.833
The slippers.

64
00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:47.916
Careful with your IV.

65
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.166
Could you hand me
the control. Luis. please?

66
00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:56.083
Look. this button is to ask for tea.

67
00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:58.208
to go to the bathroom. or anything.

68
00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:02.833
And this one is for morphine rescue.
As soon as you feel any pain. ask for it.

69
00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:06.166
Don't wait until you feel strong pain.
Ask for it. Okay?

70
00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.791
If there's anything you need. call us.

71
00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:13.958
Okay. thanks.

72
00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:15.666
-See you later.
-See you later.

73
00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:21.083
So? Do you like your room?

74
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.208
It's nice. isn't it?

75
00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:26.541
It has a view.

76
00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:32.458
What do you see?

77
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.583
Not much.

78
00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:37.291
It's quite lousy. actually.

79
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:43.625
Are you sleeping over?

80
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:46.625
Of course.

81
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.916
What do we do about Tomy?

82
00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:51.000
I've got that covered.

83
00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:54.083
Your dad or my mom
will take him to kindergarten.

84
00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:55.375
I'll pick him up.

85
00:05:55.458 --> 00:05:57.916
bring him here. and then take him back.

86
00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:00.833
-Are you sleeping on that sofa?
-Yes.

87
00:06:00.916 --> 00:06:02.291
You'll get herpes.

88
00:06:03.208 --> 00:06:05.083
I'll ask Adrián for a sleeping bag.

89
00:06:05.791 --> 00:06:07.041
They'll kick us out.

90
00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:09.125
No. I'll use it at night.
then put it away.

91
00:06:09.791 --> 00:06:10.666
It's fine.

92
00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:17.791
-Federico?
-Yes.

93
00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:20.208
How are you? Diego Vigna. Chief Physician.

94
00:06:20.291 --> 00:06:21.958
-How are you? It's a pleasure.
-Good.

95
00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:26.541
I don't wear my scrubs on Sundays.
but I always come to visit some patients.

96
00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:29.458
-Illnesses take no holidays. you know.
-Sure.

97
00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.791
I've just seen María.
I wanted to tell you about her situation.

98
00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:35.333
There's no bowel obstruction.

99
00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:38.041
The pelvic tumor
is pressing on her duodenum.

100
00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:43.041
Since the indicators are not good.

101
00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:45.666
I think the best for her
is to remain hospitalized.

102
00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:50.291
Given her condition.
we can't operate on her or continue chemo.

103
00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:52.666
And what can we do?

104
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.166
Meanwhile. we can improve her conditions.

105
00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:59.875
I would give her some corticoids
to try and control the tumor.

106
00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:06.000
Either way. all that is temporary.

107
00:07:06.083 --> 00:07:08.208
There's nothing left to do
about the disease?

108
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:10.000
Yes. a lot can be done.

109
00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:15.000
We can reduce her pain. for instance.
That's important.

110
00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:18.958
We can keep her company.
That's also very important.

111
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.708
Look. in these cases.
I always have two priorities.

112
00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:29.458
That patients don't suffer
and that they go home as soon as possible.

113
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.791
It's always better for them
to wait at home.

114
00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:36.583
in a familiar atmosphere.
surrounded by loved ones.

115
00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:19.958
Some spiders have two eyes.
and others have more.

116
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.875
And how many legs do they have?

117
00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:24.083
I don't know how many. but…

118
00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:26.041
I should check.

119
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.583
Mom!

120
00:08:27.666 --> 00:08:29.875
-Hi!
-Hello.

121
00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.500
Hi!

122
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.208
-Hey!
-Give me your bag.

123
00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:36.250
-There it is.
-I'm so glad you came.

124
00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:39.208
How are you?
How was your day at kindergarten?

125
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:41.291
Today I didn't…

126
00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:44.166
-I didn't go to school the other day.
-Really?

127
00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:47.791
It's so cool you came to visit me.

128
00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:52.291
Later. I'll check out the kindergarten
near home to see if there's a vacancy.

129
00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:53.916
Careful. it's too high.

130
00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:00.541
This bed is not like the bed at home.
It's a robot bed.

131
00:09:06.916 --> 00:09:08.375
Yes. lift it up. please.

132
00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:11.916
I need my feet up high

133
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.250
and my head down low.

134
00:09:15.583 --> 00:09:17.083
Bye!

135
00:09:20.208 --> 00:09:21.750
I'm folding over.

136
00:09:24.458 --> 00:09:25.458
Keep going.

137
00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.125
Bye!

138
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:32.750
When I press this button. it explodes.

139
00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:37.250
A bomb from the sky falls and explodes.

140
00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:40.250
Great idea. Tomy. Make the bed explode.

141
00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:41.875
No!

142
00:10:01.083 --> 00:10:01.958
Fede?

143
00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:04.416
I want you to bring me a notebook.

144
00:10:04.916 --> 00:10:07.583
You can ask Lourdes.
She makes handmade ones.

145
00:10:07.666 --> 00:10:10.375
There's one with a wolf on the cover
that is very cute.

146
00:10:13.333 --> 00:10:15.291
I want to write some things to Tomy.

147
00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:16.666
Okay.

148
00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:20.125
INFORMATION

149
00:10:20.208 --> 00:10:22.333
We said at 10:00 a.m.
What time is it?

150
00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:23.750
Twenty past ten.

151
00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:25.833
We're going to miss the visiting hours.

152
00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:27.750
They're until 12:00 p.m.. Maru.

153
00:10:31.708 --> 00:10:33.291
-Hi. how are you?
-Good morning.

154
00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:36.166
-What time do visiting hours end?
-At 12:00 p.m.

155
00:10:39.416 --> 00:10:40.875
Hello. good morning.

156
00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.375
So. what time do they end?

157
00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:47.041
There they are.

158
00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:53.083
Those bitches.
They arranged to come all together.

159
00:10:53.166 --> 00:10:54.000
No big deal.

160
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.875
Why didn't you tell me
you were meeting before?

161
00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.125
We wanted to bring her something.
a little present.

162
00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:06.791
Why a present? We didn't bring anything.

163
00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.458
Never mind. we'll share it.

164
00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:10.375
It's from all of us. It's okay.

165
00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:14.208
-No. what? Go and buy something. Go.
-Where will I get something now?

166
00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:16.375
I don't know. Bring anything.

167
00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:19.333
Well. there's a mall two blocks from here.

168
00:11:19.416 --> 00:11:21.041
-Are you kidding?
-Well.

169
00:11:21.125 --> 00:11:24.375
-Give me the car keys. I'll go.
-No. You go. I'll go to the mall.

170
00:11:24.458 --> 00:11:25.708
I'll go too. just in case.

171
00:11:25.791 --> 00:11:28.208
-Wait. Which room is she in?
-Second floor. 216.

172
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:30.375
216. Why does she get like that?

173
00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:31.541
Well. it's okay.

174
00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:35.125
Hey. we're not going upstairs
all together. are we?

175
00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:37.958
-No. let's go in groups.
-Let's go quietly.

176
00:11:40.791 --> 00:11:42.125
No. to the right.

177
00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:43.041
Fede.

178
00:11:44.375 --> 00:11:45.208
How are you?

179
00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:46.583
-What's up?
-How's it going?

180
00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:47.541
-Hi.
-How are you?

181
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.250
-How are you?
-Fine.

182
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:53.375
Fine? Hey. you'll have to wait a bit
because she's with the doctor now.

183
00:11:53.458 --> 00:11:55.750
-Okay.
-The rest are coming up anyway.

184
00:11:55.833 --> 00:11:57.041
What. everyone came?

185
00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:58.000
-Yes.
-Yes.

186
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.791
-Will they let us in all together?
-I don't know. Let's try.

187
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:05.875
-Do you want to sit?
-No.

188
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.083
How is she?

189
00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:10.541
Fine. Calm.

190
00:12:11.625 --> 00:12:12.541
Is she in pain?

191
00:12:13.083 --> 00:12:14.250
She says a little.

192
00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:17.083
That she can take it.
You know what she's like.

193
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.958
Oh. I got her an amazing room.
Great. Five stars.

194
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.250
That's great.

195
00:12:32.416 --> 00:12:33.375
Okay. very well.

196
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:36.458
-How are you feeling today?
-Bad.

197
00:12:37.041 --> 00:12:39.291
I'm hospitalized again. 20 doctors saw me.

198
00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:42.458
no one can do anything.
I'm sick of being in bed.

199
00:12:43.041 --> 00:12:44.750
I understand. What about the pain?

200
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.500
No. that's fine. I can still take it.

201
00:12:48.291 --> 00:12:50.375
-Did you go to the bathroom yet?
-No.

202
00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:53.375
Okay. We'll be monitoring that.

203
00:12:54.083 --> 00:12:57.208
I'll raise your backrest
so we are at the same height.

204
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:04.625
There.

205
00:13:06.666 --> 00:13:07.500
How are you?

206
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.083
Very well.

207
00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:10.916
I'm great.

208
00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:15.416
One question.

209
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.375
When this gets unbearable.
you'll put me to sleep. right?

210
00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:22.416
We'll talk about that at some point.

211
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.541
And then we won't discuss it again.
But not yet.

212
00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:27.875
How much longer will it take?

213
00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:31.166
-For what?
-For that moment to arrive.

214
00:13:31.708 --> 00:13:33.375
No. well. I can't know that.

215
00:13:33.916 --> 00:13:36.583
Anyway. nobody leaves before their time.

216
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.041
Don't worry.
I can't do anything to speed it up.

217
00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.041
-Do you feel comfortable in this room?
-I do.

218
00:13:48.916 --> 00:13:50.666
It matters to me that you're well.

219
00:13:58.916 --> 00:14:00.375
What do you think?

220
00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:02.958
Why did this happen to me?

221
00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.250
It didn't happen to you.

222
00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:07.791
This is all yours.

223
00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:11.750
It's not a virus. a bacterium
that comes from outside and attacks you.

224
00:14:11.833 --> 00:14:13.500
Otherwise. it would be contagious.

225
00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:17.166
This cancer is...

226
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:19.208
100% yours.

227
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.375
We could say it's named María.

228
00:14:22.041 --> 00:14:23.291
Let's not say that.

229
00:14:23.375 --> 00:14:24.583
-No. right?
-No.

230
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:28.083
It's genetic.

231
00:14:29.708 --> 00:14:31.708
Yes. there are some cancers that…

232
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:34.541
are related to customs. habits.

233
00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:37.833
If you smoked
three packs of cigarettes a day.

234
00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:40.041
it's likely that you'd get lung cancer.

235
00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:43.875
But. in general. it has to do
with your genetic information.

236
00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:57.125
Could they come in?

237
00:14:58.541 --> 00:14:59.916
This is a rally.

238
00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:01.833
They're all friends.

239
00:15:03.583 --> 00:15:04.458
Tell them to go in.

240
00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.166
-Come on.
-Hello.

241
00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.375
-Hello.
-How are you?

242
00:15:07.458 --> 00:15:08.375
Thanks.

243
00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:10.916
How is she?

244
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.250
She knows everything.

245
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.333
She got it quickly. She's smart.

246
00:15:14.416 --> 00:15:17.375
I'm starting to see
the kind of relationship you two have.

247
00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:20.208
It's a sanely pathological symbiosis.

248
00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:24.875
Don't worry.
I have the same thing with my wife.

249
00:15:29.833 --> 00:15:32.875
Well. Tomy. look. here's your mother.

250
00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.500
in this mega-super-ultra-VIP room.

251
00:15:37.416 --> 00:15:40.125
which your father got.
because he's a damn genius.

252
00:15:40.208 --> 00:15:43.250
Look at these amazing designer armchairs.

253
00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:44.708
Look at this floor.

254
00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:47.541
And let me show you. son.

255
00:15:47.625 --> 00:15:49.833
what the bathroom looks like.

256
00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:51.875
Look at this. marble.

257
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:53.625
Marble.

258
00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:55.583
It's spectacular.

259
00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.333
Well. and here's your mother.

260
00:16:00.416 --> 00:16:03.375
who. as usual. for a change.
pays little attention to me.

261
00:16:03.458 --> 00:16:05.583
plays the fool and looks at her phone.

262
00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:08.333
tweets and who knows what.

263
00:16:08.416 --> 00:16:09.708
Always the same.

264
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.250
-And here we are with all our friends.
-Try harder.

265
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.750
I'll introduce them to you. son. look.

266
00:16:16.833 --> 00:16:18.916
-This is Shoy.
-Foot.

267
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
She's an eminent Lacanian psychologist.

268
00:16:21.083 --> 00:16:22.250
No. stop it.

269
00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:24.500
-What did I say wrong?
-I'm not a psychologist.

270
00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:25.916
-What are you?
-An analyst.

271
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.791
-She'll hit you.
-No…

272
00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:32.125
She's a Lacanian analyst. sorry.
I apologize.

273
00:16:32.208 --> 00:16:33.291
It's worse.

274
00:16:33.375 --> 00:16:36.875
-Here's Paula.
-Hello. Tomy.

275
00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.541
-She's a writer.
-I am.

276
00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:42.083
You'll read her book
because she mentions your mom in it.

277
00:16:42.166 --> 00:16:43.625
Here's Charlie.

278
00:16:43.708 --> 00:16:45.083
Hi. Charlie.

279
00:16:45.166 --> 00:16:46.416
Ladies and gentlemen.

280
00:16:47.166 --> 00:16:49.125
-More than a friend…
-He's a sister.

281
00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:51.250
-A sister. right.
-Totally.

282
00:16:51.333 --> 00:16:53.333
Be careful with what you say.

283
00:16:53.875 --> 00:16:57.083
Here we have Brenda. She's an artist.

284
00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:59.958
Actually she's a "sartist"
because she's sick of everything.

285
00:17:00.041 --> 00:17:01.375
Sick of everybody.

286
00:17:01.458 --> 00:17:04.250
There she is.
She's a designer. an illustrator.

287
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:05.708
A genius.

288
00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:08.750
This is. ladies and gentlemen. Vera.

289
00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:13.041
Believe it or not. she's the CEO
of an insurance company.

290
00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:17.500
-She's tanned all year round.
-Believe it or not!

291
00:17:18.083 --> 00:17:20.041
-Gorgeous.
-And here's Leti.

292
00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:21.875
She works for the city government.

293
00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:25.708
If you get into a mess. son.
talk to Leti and she'll fix it.

294
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:26.875
I'll fix it for you.

295
00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:27.833
Look.

296
00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:30.041
This is Agus.

297
00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:33.666
She teaches journalism and dances tango.

298
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.125
-Yes!
-There you go!

299
00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:38.958
That's it. Shake it!

300
00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:41.458
-And here's Roxi.
-Yes.

301
00:17:41.541 --> 00:17:42.916
A housewife. people.

302
00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:45.458
What? Not exclusively.

303
00:17:45.541 --> 00:17:47.666
-What?
-I'm a social worker as well.

304
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.583
But you didn't get your degree.
Did you finish the course?

305
00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:52.958
Kick his ass.

306
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:54.833
Fine. social worker. Sorry.

307
00:17:54.916 --> 00:17:56.208
And here's Maru.

308
00:17:56.291 --> 00:17:58.208
I won't introduce this character to you

309
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:00.791
because you'll have to tolerate her
all your life.

310
00:18:00.875 --> 00:18:04.291
Like Hernán. who's back there.
Poor good man.

311
00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:07.166
Hernán buys and sells apartments.
What do they call it now?

312
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.083
A broker.

313
00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:10.083
-A broker. right.
-A real estate broker.

314
00:18:10.166 --> 00:18:11.333
-A broker.
-Exactly.

315
00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:13.875
Well. here we are.

316
00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:17.458
We're deciding
whether she stays here or we go home.

317
00:18:17.541 --> 00:18:20.750
but they clean everything for you here.
It's like a honeymoon for us.

318
00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:22.458
-Yeah. right.
-Look at this. son.

319
00:18:22.541 --> 00:18:25.750
-Look at the view we have. panoramic.
-Spectacular.

320
00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:29.541
-Pure cement. good cement.
-Look at the green field at the back.

321
00:18:29.625 --> 00:18:31.125
So. here we are.

322
00:18:31.208 --> 00:18:34.958
Among friends. laughing our asses off.

323
00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:38.333
This is how your mother…

324
00:18:42.791 --> 00:18:45.291
This is the kind of person your mother is.

325
00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:47.416
This person.

326
00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:51.000
And that's why I love her like I do.

327
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.833
Bye. son.

328
00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:07.583
<i>It's amazing how often people tell me</i>
<i>that I'm brave and strong.</i>

329
00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:12.291
<i>I think that what I do</i>
<i>is the only possible option.</i>

330
00:19:12.375 --> 00:19:13.750
<i>What else can I do?</i>

331
00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:17.583
<i>Sink into self-pity?</i>

332
00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:23.208
<i>I better do</i>
<i>the cancer show on Twitter.</i>

333
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.291
<i>The truth is. I feel bad all the time.</i>

334
00:19:28.916 --> 00:19:31.875
<i>It's like succeeding all the time.</i>
<i>but the other way around.</i>

335
00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:32.958
Another eye.

336
00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:36.458
And…

337
00:19:38.125 --> 00:19:42.125
I think we'd better
leave the pizzas for later.

338
00:19:42.208 --> 00:19:44.583
because I really enjoy making eyes.

339
00:21:21.083 --> 00:21:24.416
This one is happy. and this one is angry.

340
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.500
-This one is very happy.
-And this one?

341
00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:28.083
This one is sad.

342
00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:32.000
-Why?
-Because these are happiness.

343
00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.416
-Which color is anger?
-Red.

344
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.875
-And sadness?
-This one.

345
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.166
There are three happiness and one sadness?

346
00:21:40.208 --> 00:21:41.041
Very good.

347
00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:42.500
Is this one happy?

348
00:21:43.416 --> 00:21:45.458
-No.
-Is this the sad one?

349
00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:47.958
Three are happy. and this one is sad.

350
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:51.916
No. this… This one is angry.

351
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.041
And this one is happy.

352
00:21:54.625 --> 00:21:56.916
Why is this one angry?

353
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Because it wants the hap…
the angry one here.

354
00:22:02.166 --> 00:22:03.875
This is the color for angry.

355
00:22:03.958 --> 00:22:07.958
-Right.
-And this color is blue

356
00:22:08.041 --> 00:22:10.500
that… is sadness.

357
00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:11.916
It's true.

358
00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.375
<i>What an unlucky break</i>
<i>to get sick like this.</i>

359
00:22:16.458 --> 00:22:20.541
<i>I miss going out for walks with you</i>
<i>and spending half an hour on each thing.</i>

360
00:22:21.458 --> 00:22:24.958
<i>Sometimes. we go out wandering</i>
<i>to buy food. we eat ice cream.</i>

361
00:22:25.458 --> 00:22:28.083
<i>and you throw a tantrum</i>
<i>and you don't want to walk.</i>

362
00:22:28.166 --> 00:22:31.291
<i>And you want to get out of the stroller</i>
<i>in the middle of an avenue.</i>

363
00:22:31.791 --> 00:22:33.166
<i>I miss this.</i>

364
00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.666
<i>And I want you to know</i>
<i>that those have been</i>…

365
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.333
…<i>the happiest moments of my life…</i>

366
00:22:40.708 --> 00:22:41.541
…<i>and I love you.</i>

367
00:22:49.333 --> 00:22:51.166
-Hello. María.
-Excuse me.

368
00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:53.666
This is Marina. a new resident.

369
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.375
She started with us this week. She'll be
at the hospital for a few months.

370
00:22:57.458 --> 00:22:59.250
-Hello. Marina.
-Hello. how are you?

371
00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:01.125
-Fine.
-How did you do last night?

372
00:23:01.208 --> 00:23:03.208
Not so good. Had some pain.

373
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.666
-And nausea?
-That too.

374
00:23:07.083 --> 00:23:09.916
-Well. relax. We'll take care of that.
-Okay.

375
00:23:10.416 --> 00:23:13.458
-Did you graduate long ago?
-In December. not long ago.

376
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:14.500
-Great.
-Yes.

377
00:23:14.583 --> 00:23:16.541
-What specialty?
-Cardiology.

378
00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:17.958
-Hello.
-Hello. Doctor.

379
00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:20.708
-How are you?
-Not so well.

380
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:23.791
She feels a little pain.

381
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.333
Let's see.

382
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:27.833
Let me see.

383
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.333
-Here?
-Yes.

384
00:23:34.416 --> 00:23:36.791
-Like a pull. right?
-Yes. like a pull.

385
00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:41.541
If it gets more intense.
we'll have to administer some morphine.

386
00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:43.875
Yeah? Can't we wait a little for that?

387
00:23:44.458 --> 00:23:47.083
What for? No. it will relieve the pain.

388
00:23:47.666 --> 00:23:49.666
I don't know. because it's not that bad.

389
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.333
You'll feel better.
Don't deprive yourself.

390
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.708
Fede.
we'll have to organize a little. right?

391
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:57.791
We don't know how long she'll be here.

392
00:23:59.208 --> 00:24:00.875
Until her body can't take it. I guess.

393
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:03.500
But you know Marie.

394
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.291
One day. she'll say. "I've had enough."

395
00:24:06.375 --> 00:24:08.541
and want to organize it all.
even the time.

396
00:24:08.625 --> 00:24:11.500
Yes. but this is not about Marie.
It's about you and Tomy.

397
00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:15.333
I've organized Tomy's kindergarten
with my mom and Marie's dad.

398
00:24:15.416 --> 00:24:17.916
It's not just kindergarten.
You have to eat.

399
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.750
You can't live off sandwiches.

400
00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:22.416
If you have to spend a month or two here.
what'll you do?

401
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.083
We can't invite you over
because we live far away.

402
00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:28.000
Perfect. Thanks.
I will manage some way. Yes.

403
00:24:28.083 --> 00:24:30.916
You have to get changed.
for example. have some clean clothes--

404
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.916
Get off my back. Maru.
I'm in the trenches.

405
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.750
-So you haven't showered in 2 weeks?
-Is that even necessary?

406
00:24:35.833 --> 00:24:37.708
-It's gross.
-Maru is right.

407
00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:40.708
We have to get organized.

408
00:24:40.791 --> 00:24:42.541
Yes. visits. for example.

409
00:24:42.625 --> 00:24:44.166
You can't be here all day.

410
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:45.708
Fine.

411
00:24:45.791 --> 00:24:47.916
I'll start a group chat without Marie.

412
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.958
with the 12-girl mob and Charlie.

413
00:24:50.041 --> 00:24:53.000
and we'll get all visits organized
from Monday to Monday.

414
00:24:53.083 --> 00:24:53.916
Hello?

415
00:24:54.791 --> 00:24:55.666
Who is this?

416
00:24:56.833 --> 00:24:57.958
Hello. how are you?

417
00:24:58.791 --> 00:25:00.583
Yes. she received it.

418
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:02.708
Yes. she loved it.

419
00:25:03.666 --> 00:25:04.791
Thank you very much.

420
00:25:05.916 --> 00:25:06.750
Bye.

421
00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:09.166
It was Lu. the notebook girl.

422
00:25:09.791 --> 00:25:12.166
She's a friend of Marie
from another group. right?

423
00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.083
From the embroidering
and crafts group. That bullshit.

424
00:25:15.166 --> 00:25:16.208
She's great. anyway.

425
00:25:16.958 --> 00:25:18.625
She embroiders. but she's great.

426
00:25:21.375 --> 00:25:24.958
Oh. I have a new ache every day.
Now my back hurts a lot.

427
00:25:25.583 --> 00:25:27.625
Yes. you are in bed a lot.

428
00:25:27.708 --> 00:25:30.125
We'll try to ask for an air mattress.

429
00:25:31.541 --> 00:25:33.375
-It didn't hurt yesterday.
-Easy.

430
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:38.000
No. your body is more fragile.
You are more sensitive.

431
00:25:39.125 --> 00:25:40.583
Hold the IV. please.

432
00:25:49.291 --> 00:25:50.708
It's nice outside. isn't it?

433
00:25:51.208 --> 00:25:52.583
Yes. it's sunny.

434
00:25:54.416 --> 00:25:55.250
I want to see.

435
00:25:57.375 --> 00:25:58.791
-Can you go alone?
-Yes.

436
00:25:58.875 --> 00:25:59.708
Are you okay?

437
00:26:12.375 --> 00:26:14.375
They're assembling
a huge crane over there.

438
00:26:15.166 --> 00:26:17.125
Do you know
if they're building something?

439
00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:19.125
A mall. they say.

440
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:25.083
<i>It's hard to accept that the world goes on</i>
<i>without us. but we must.</i>

441
00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:26.500
<i>Or not even that.</i>

442
00:26:27.041 --> 00:26:28.958
<i>We're so irrelevant to the universe</i>

443
00:26:29.041 --> 00:26:31.708
<i>that it doesn't give a shit</i>
<i>if we accept it or not.</i>

444
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.208
<i>Even if you want to get on or off.</i>

445
00:26:35.291 --> 00:26:39.375
<i>even if you want to pause</i>
<i>a level 100 evolving metastatic carcinoma</i>

446
00:26:39.458 --> 00:26:42.083
<i>to. I don't know.</i>
<i>see your son finish primary school.</i>

447
00:26:42.166 --> 00:26:45.541
<i>the world goes on. and on top of that.</i>
<i>it goes faster and faster.</i>

448
00:26:56.125 --> 00:26:58.250
What's wrong. María? What do you need?

449
00:26:58.333 --> 00:27:01.208
I need to go to the toilet. now.
I have to throw up.

450
00:27:01.875 --> 00:27:03.166
What was that?

451
00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:08.375
Let's go.

452
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:17.125
I told you it wasn't a good idea
to camp there.

453
00:27:18.958 --> 00:27:21.458
If you keep vomiting.
we'll have to give you a catheter.

454
00:27:21.541 --> 00:27:22.625
-Okay.
-Okay?

455
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
-Better?
-Yes.

456
00:27:54.625 --> 00:27:56.000
-Do you feel better?
-Yes.

457
00:28:02.375 --> 00:28:04.500
If you need anything else. call me.

458
00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:05.875
-Okay.
-Okay?

459
00:28:10.333 --> 00:28:12.166
I didn't see anything. Go on sleeping.

460
00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:13.625
Thanks.

461
00:28:24.916 --> 00:28:26.833
Why didn't you call me if you felt sick?

462
00:28:28.333 --> 00:28:31.041
Because you were sound asleep.
and you need to rest.

463
00:28:42.833 --> 00:28:46.291
Also. because I should be able
to walk to the bathroom by myself.

464
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:48.166
I should.

465
00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:46.375
<i>I'm madly in love with your strong thighs.</i>

466
00:29:46.458 --> 00:29:49.750
<i>your Mick Jagger haircut.</i>
<i>your mouth that looks like mine.</i>

467
00:29:51.125 --> 00:29:54.791
<i>You are just like me when I was a child.</i>
<i>But I feel you are happier.</i>

468
00:29:55.375 --> 00:29:57.208
<i>Could it be a wish?</i>

469
00:29:58.333 --> 00:29:59.833
<i>I'd like to go far away.</i>

470
00:29:59.916 --> 00:30:03.250
<i>to a field</i>
<i>where you could run wildly. screaming.</i>

471
00:30:12.291 --> 00:30:14.500
Congratulations
on the article about your wife.

472
00:30:14.583 --> 00:30:17.208
-What article?
-The one in <i>Clarín</i>. Didn't you read it?

473
00:30:17.291 --> 00:30:19.041
-No.
-I'll bring it to you.

474
00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:28.000
Here it is.

475
00:30:28.083 --> 00:30:29.416
WOMAN MOVES PEOPLE ON TWITTER

476
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.666
-When is this from?
-It's today's newspaper.

477
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.333
TELLING OF HER FIGHT AGAINST CANCER

478
00:30:33.416 --> 00:30:34.250
Keep it.

479
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:36.125
-I'll bring it back.
-Yes. no problem.

480
00:30:43.125 --> 00:30:44.000
Marie.

481
00:30:44.083 --> 00:30:45.750
-Yes?
-Look what published in <i>Clarín.</i>

482
00:30:48.291 --> 00:30:49.208
What's this?

483
00:30:51.166 --> 00:30:52.875
Who's the author? Do you know her?

484
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.916
No. Have you read it?

485
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.583
Yes. It's a great article.

486
00:30:57.666 --> 00:30:59.458
-Really?
-Yes. I mean it.

487
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.083
How are you. Maru?

488
00:31:03.333 --> 00:31:05.500
I have no idea. I don't know.

489
00:31:08.875 --> 00:31:11.458
She says the article is on the front page
of their site.

490
00:31:11.541 --> 00:31:13.041
The article is the whole page.

491
00:31:13.541 --> 00:31:14.625
Yes. I'll put her on.

492
00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:18.208
Hi. how are you?

493
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.666
No. I have no idea.

494
00:31:21.375 --> 00:31:22.875
Ask the girls.

495
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.916
See?

496
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.166
I'm becoming famous. Too late.

497
00:31:28.333 --> 00:31:29.166
Okay.

498
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:32.916
See you later.
See you in the afternoon. Kisses.

499
00:31:35.583 --> 00:31:39.208
Do you think they'll start bothering us
with interviews now?

500
00:31:41.166 --> 00:31:42.375
What's this scandal?

501
00:31:42.458 --> 00:31:44.750
-Did you see?
-Are you a celebrity now?

502
00:31:44.833 --> 00:31:46.458
-Hi.
-I can't believe it!

503
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:48.583
Right?

504
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.666
It's so unfair you're becoming famous
for cancer and not for your ass.

505
00:31:53.083 --> 00:31:54.333
I can't believe it.

506
00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:56.166
Such a nice ass!

507
00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.833
My belly aches.

508
00:31:57.916 --> 00:32:00.833
Do you need a hand to get on the bed?
You managed alone.

509
00:32:00.916 --> 00:32:03.666
Would you help me
put the backrest up. Hernán?

510
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.041
Did other media call you?

511
00:32:05.125 --> 00:32:07.750
Yes. but I won't waste time
on this nonsense now.

512
00:32:07.833 --> 00:32:10.458
-Who called you?
-A morning show.

513
00:32:11.125 --> 00:32:12.583
-Which one?
-From Channel 11.

514
00:32:12.666 --> 00:32:14.166
Vero Lozano's show?

515
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.250
Yes. Vero Lozano's.

516
00:32:16.333 --> 00:32:17.333
You'll do it.

517
00:32:17.416 --> 00:32:20.000
No. I won't. What for?

518
00:32:20.083 --> 00:32:22.333
-Why would I?
-Everybody watches that show.

519
00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:25.125
And what do I care?
What difference does it make?

520
00:32:26.166 --> 00:32:28.208
No. you're right. I don't know.

521
00:32:28.875 --> 00:32:30.416
Did you bring me anything to eat?

522
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.333
We're not bringing you food anymore.
not after the other night.

523
00:32:33.416 --> 00:32:35.458
-But Hernán brought you something.
-What?

524
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:37.083
Right.

525
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:42.625
The speaker.

526
00:32:43.333 --> 00:32:45.083
-Thanks!
-So you can listen to music.

527
00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:46.458
Thank you so much.

528
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.666
No. this one's yours.
The one you take to work.

529
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:53.458
It doesn't matter. It's yours now.

530
00:32:54.041 --> 00:32:54.875
Thanks.

531
00:32:55.875 --> 00:32:57.083
-Hello.
-Good morning.

532
00:32:57.166 --> 00:32:59.166
Good morning.
Do you know where Dr. Vigna is?

533
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.083
I'll call him.

534
00:33:00.833 --> 00:33:04.625
Dr. Vigna.
contact the information desk. please.

535
00:33:04.708 --> 00:33:05.541
Thanks.

536
00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:08.416
There are several things
left for your wife at the main desk.

537
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.083
-Several things? What things?
-Presents.

538
00:33:11.625 --> 00:33:14.125
-Okay. I'll pick them up later.
-Okay.

539
00:33:14.625 --> 00:33:16.500
Hello? Yes. Doctor.

540
00:33:16.583 --> 00:33:19.875
The husband of the patient in room 216
is looking for you.

541
00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:23.458
Okay. perfect. He says you can go
to his office upstairs.

542
00:33:23.541 --> 00:33:26.125
-Great. I'll get the gifts later.
-I'll tell the desk.

543
00:33:27.041 --> 00:33:27.875
Hello.

544
00:33:28.541 --> 00:33:30.416
-Federico. come in.
-Excuse me.

545
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.666
-Nice article in <i>Clarín.</i>
-Yes. it is.

546
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.708
Thanks for mentioning the hospital.

547
00:33:35.791 --> 00:33:38.958
No. we had nothing to do with it.
We don't even know who wrote it.

548
00:33:39.041 --> 00:33:39.875
Take a seat.

549
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.083
Doctor.
Channel 11 wants to interview María.

550
00:33:45.166 --> 00:33:47.750
-Live? With cameras?
-Yes.

551
00:33:47.833 --> 00:33:50.125
You can't enter the hospital with cameras.

552
00:33:50.916 --> 00:33:52.750
You know I do everything I can.

553
00:33:52.833 --> 00:33:57.000
But you can't enter with plants.
in groups or with children.

554
00:33:57.083 --> 00:34:00.208
However. I allow you to do those things.
But no cameras.

555
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:02.333
-The board would kill me.
-Right.

556
00:34:02.416 --> 00:34:04.708
Why don't you do
the interview over the phone?

557
00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:06.500
Maybe. yes.

558
00:34:06.583 --> 00:34:09.333
It might be best.
She may not want to be seen like this.

559
00:34:09.416 --> 00:34:10.791
She doesn't care about that.

560
00:34:12.041 --> 00:34:15.333
Yes. anyway.
What matters is what she says. right?

561
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.791
How long until they call?

562
00:34:18.375 --> 00:34:19.291
Three minutes.

563
00:34:21.625 --> 00:34:23.625
-Does it still hurt?
-A bit.

564
00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:25.958
-Well. I'll ask for morphine.
-No. wait. Don't.

565
00:34:26.041 --> 00:34:28.916
-You can't do the interview in pain.
-I'll put up with it a bit.

566
00:34:29.416 --> 00:34:32.750
I don't want it now.
I'll be drooling like a fool.

567
00:34:32.833 --> 00:34:33.916
I don't want that.

568
00:34:35.791 --> 00:34:36.875
I don't want that.

569
00:34:39.166 --> 00:34:41.083
Look. this is the channel.
That's the show.

570
00:34:43.583 --> 00:34:45.583
<i>Social media is an endless resource.</i>

571
00:34:45.666 --> 00:34:49.166
<i>not only for catharsis.</i>
<i>to communicate moods. to protest…</i>

572
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.416
-Is she on?
-Not yet.

573
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.166
<i>…in 140 characters.</i>
<i>but also to talk about diseases. </i>

574
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.666
<i>to identify with someone else</i>

575
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.458
<i>who may be going through the same thing</i>
<i>on the other end.</i>

576
00:34:57.541 --> 00:35:01.375
<i>We learned about María Vázquez's story.</i>
<i>A very special story.</i>

577
00:35:01.458 --> 00:35:04.791
<i>She has cancer.</i>
<i>she's in treatment fighting cancer.</i>

578
00:35:04.875 --> 00:35:07.083
<i>and is in the final stages</i>
<i>of chemotherapy.</i>

579
00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:11.083
<i>Ovarian cancer. María. through her tweets.</i>
<i>told us all this. Leo will read it.</i>

580
00:35:11.166 --> 00:35:14.291
<i>Let's see some tweets María Marie wrote</i>
<i>to welcome and talk to her.</i>

581
00:35:14.375 --> 00:35:18.625
MARÍA VÁZQUEZ FIGHTS CANCER

582
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:29.125
<i>Well. she's on the line.</i>
<i>María Vázquez. how are you?</i>

583
00:35:29.208 --> 00:35:31.166
<i>Vero and Leo here. How's it going?</i>

584
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.666
Hi. Leo. Hi. Vero.

585
00:35:33.291 --> 00:35:34.666
Hello. how are you?

586
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.333
Thanks for calling me.

587
00:35:36.916 --> 00:35:39.541
-No. I can't hear anything.
-The feedback. What can I do?

588
00:35:40.291 --> 00:35:44.416
Seven months ago.
I had quite a radical operation.

589
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.000
a hysterectomy.

590
00:35:46.083 --> 00:35:49.708
Where I had everything removed.
I was completely emptied.

591
00:35:49.791 --> 00:35:51.541
I got totally hollowed out.

592
00:35:51.625 --> 00:35:53.916
More than before.

593
00:35:54.583 --> 00:35:58.250
And from then on.
I started getting chemotherapy.

594
00:35:58.333 --> 00:36:01.500
which worked and worked
until it didn't work anymore.

595
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.041
And… well…

596
00:36:04.125 --> 00:36:06.250
Now there's nothing left to do.

597
00:36:06.333 --> 00:36:09.041
We're here waiting for the time to come.

598
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:10.916
<i>Waiting for…</i>

599
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.083
<i>What you say is really tough. but…</i>

600
00:36:13.166 --> 00:36:16.791
The time to die.
We have to put it starkly.

601
00:36:16.875 --> 00:36:18.666
Yes. the time of my death.

602
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:23.500
<i>Your time to die. There's nothing to do.</i>
<i>There's nothing left to be done?</i>

603
00:36:23.583 --> 00:36:26.041
I'm in quite a fragile state of health.

604
00:36:26.125 --> 00:36:28.166
They can't operate on me.

605
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.166
I can't receive more chemotherapy
because I'm too weak.

606
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:35.166
In spite of that. I'm in a place
where they take good care of me.

607
00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:37.625
It's a very nice place.
They treat me very well.

608
00:36:37.708 --> 00:36:40.916
<i>And. María. you have gone.</i>
<i>according to your tweets.</i>

609
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.541
<i>I think. through all moods.</i>

610
00:36:43.625 --> 00:36:47.208
<i>You've shown humor. anger. and irony.</i>

611
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.333
<i>Which mood are you in currently?</i>

612
00:36:51.416 --> 00:36:54.750
<i>Well. currently. it's funny.</i>
<i>because for those who come to visit me</i>

613
00:36:54.833 --> 00:36:57.333
<i>I do a kind of cancer stand-up monologue.</i>

614
00:36:58.125 --> 00:37:03.083
<i>So. unless you find me</i>
<i>puking in a bucket…</i>

615
00:37:03.166 --> 00:37:06.875
<i>I'm generally surrounded by laughter.</i>

616
00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:09.666
<i>And your kid is three years old. María.</i>

617
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.000
<i>and I mean. do you think about him when…</i>

618
00:37:14.291 --> 00:37:17.375
I think about him a lot.
I talk to him a lot too.

619
00:37:17.458 --> 00:37:19.541
We record videos for him.

620
00:37:20.583 --> 00:37:22.208
I explain everything as it is.

621
00:37:22.291 --> 00:37:23.458
<i>What have you told him?</i>

622
00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:27.875
We're gonna tell him that… in a while.
Mom will no longer be here.

623
00:37:27.958 --> 00:37:32.125
but that I will always be in his heart.
And I think he will understand.

624
00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:34.625
<i>And your husband?</i>
<i>Are you together? </i>

625
00:37:34.708 --> 00:37:37.000
<i>We're looking at your husband with you.</i>

626
00:37:37.083 --> 00:37:39.666
That photo we're seeing
is from my wedding.

627
00:37:40.333 --> 00:37:42.250
I got married in total sin.

628
00:37:42.333 --> 00:37:44.458
because I was seven months pregnant.

629
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.958
And that's Fede. yes.

630
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:50.916
My husband accompanies me.

631
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.666
takes care of me.
he's here with me all the time.

632
00:37:54.166 --> 00:37:57.375
<i>When they told you or when</i>
<i>you found out you had ovarian cancer.</i>

633
00:37:57.458 --> 00:38:00.625
<i>did you have a positive attitude?</i>
<i>Did you feel you could pull through?</i>

634
00:38:00.708 --> 00:38:03.041
<i>More than how I found out is</i>
<i>how I guessed it.</i>

635
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.625
<i>What was that like?</i>

636
00:38:06.125 --> 00:38:08.125
I went to have an ultrasound done

637
00:38:08.208 --> 00:38:12.333
because my belly looked
as if I was six months pregnant.

638
00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:14.333
And the doctor.

639
00:38:14.416 --> 00:38:17.250
you know how doctors
talk between themselves

640
00:38:17.333 --> 00:38:20.833
and they think you don't realize
what they're talking about.

641
00:38:20.916 --> 00:38:25.375
<i>-They sometimes underestimate patients.</i>
<i>-Exactly. they underestimate the patient.</i>

642
00:38:26.458 --> 00:38:29.666
So. the doctor told
the ultrasound technician.

643
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.791
"On a scale of 'I don't know what.'

644
00:38:32.875 --> 00:38:35.125
<i>where 45 is a lot.</i>

645
00:38:35.208 --> 00:38:38.916
<i>what do you think this is?"</i>
<i>And the woman says.</i>

646
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.791
<i>"This? It's a hundred."</i>

647
00:38:41.833 --> 00:38:43.791
<i>María. how old are you now?</i>

648
00:38:43.875 --> 00:38:47.458
I'm 42. and I'll be 43 in two days.

649
00:38:49.875 --> 00:38:51.375
<i>You'll be 43 in two days.</i>

650
00:38:51.458 --> 00:38:53.291
Exactly. If I make it…

651
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:55.125
I'll be 43.

652
00:38:55.208 --> 00:38:57.708
<i>You are so humorous and ironic about it.</i>

653
00:38:57.791 --> 00:39:00.541
<i>I don't know whether it helps you</i>
<i>or it's your shield. </i>

654
00:39:00.625 --> 00:39:03.291
<i>but it comes out all the time.</i>

655
00:39:03.375 --> 00:39:05.541
No. it doesn't help me.

656
00:39:05.625 --> 00:39:08.166
And it's not a shield either.

657
00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.666
This is how I really am.

658
00:39:10.333 --> 00:39:11.541
This is the real me.

659
00:39:11.625 --> 00:39:13.833
Sometimes my friends laugh their asses off

660
00:39:13.916 --> 00:39:17.083
because they visit me.
and they are more dramatic than I am.

661
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.333
I think the right word is "acceptance."

662
00:39:20.875 --> 00:39:23.000
It's accepting and…

663
00:39:23.625 --> 00:39:26.125
And death is part of life.

664
00:39:51.958 --> 00:39:54.666
Six. I have four. six. seven.

665
00:39:55.583 --> 00:39:56.500
It's seven.

666
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.875
That much?

667
00:39:59.083 --> 00:40:00.125
Seven is a lot.

668
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.500
One. two. three. seven. eleven.

669
00:40:03.583 --> 00:40:06.541
Fourteen. seven. eleven. fourteen. seven.

670
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.541
<i>You're very funny. Tomy.</i>
<i>You say such amusing things.</i>

671
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.291
Come on. just one.
Besides. it's strawberry season.

672
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:27.166
I can't.
My body can't take them. Maru. I swear.

673
00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:28.416
Come on. Just one.

674
00:40:28.916 --> 00:40:30.375
-Just one.
-There you go.

675
00:40:33.125 --> 00:40:35.750
-What's this?
-They've changed my mattress.

676
00:40:36.291 --> 00:40:38.250
-Why?
-I wore the other one out fucking.

677
00:40:38.333 --> 00:40:40.750
Right. the girls and I wanted to tell you

678
00:40:40.833 --> 00:40:43.541
to take it easy.
because it's rumored in the hospital

679
00:40:43.625 --> 00:40:45.041
that this room is a party.

680
00:40:50.166 --> 00:40:51.083
Hey. Maru…

681
00:40:54.166 --> 00:40:57.333
I want Fede to be with someone.
You take care of that.

682
00:40:57.416 --> 00:41:00.041
I want him to get laid. to marry.

683
00:41:00.125 --> 00:41:01.208
Look what I'm asking.

684
00:41:01.291 --> 00:41:05.458
Marie. it took him 18 years to marry you.
Just getting laid would be okay for him.

685
00:41:05.541 --> 00:41:07.750
No. I mean it. Seriously.

686
00:41:09.541 --> 00:41:11.541
I don't want him to be depressed.

687
00:41:12.625 --> 00:41:14.000
I want him to get laid.

688
00:41:14.583 --> 00:41:16.250
to be happy. To live.

689
00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:21.375
<i>Despite the fact that I'm losing</i>
<i>my eyelashes. such a horrible thing.</i>

690
00:41:21.458 --> 00:41:24.291
I'm sorry. They've brought
many more things for your wife.

691
00:41:24.375 --> 00:41:26.583
-More?
-After the show. Yes.

692
00:41:26.666 --> 00:41:28.833
<i>Even though I lost my ass. I lost 12 kilos</i>

693
00:41:28.916 --> 00:41:31.458
<i>and I have less muscle tone than a slug.</i>

694
00:41:31.541 --> 00:41:34.583
<i>I feel pretty.</i>
<i>Bald and looking like a skeleton.</i>

695
00:41:35.083 --> 00:41:37.041
They're in boxes
so they wouldn't get lost.

696
00:41:37.125 --> 00:41:38.458
-Thanks.
-There's another one.

697
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:40.583
-Another? I'll come back later. okay?
-Okay.

698
00:41:40.666 --> 00:41:44.166
<i>It may seem trivial.</i>
<i>but brushing your teeth. putting on lotion</i>

699
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:46.833
<i>helps you keep feeling like yourself.</i>

700
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.791
<i>Cancer doesn't take your vanity away.</i>

701
00:41:52.291 --> 00:41:53.333
How does it look?

702
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:00.666
You look great today.

703
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.583
Well. yes. of course.

704
00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:05.625
They gave me. like. three morphine shots.

705
00:42:06.416 --> 00:42:07.666
I'm. like. floating.

706
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.166
Look. just what we needed.
This cat is everywhere.

707
00:42:13.791 --> 00:42:15.875
It's a <i>maneki-neko</i>.

708
00:42:17.333 --> 00:42:18.625
It brings luck.

709
00:42:21.916 --> 00:42:24.125
What else did they bring me? What else?

710
00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:26.333
Lotion. another lotion. more lotions.

711
00:42:27.458 --> 00:42:28.500
-Hello.
-Hi.

712
00:42:28.583 --> 00:42:30.083
We're bringing more presents.

713
00:42:30.166 --> 00:42:32.500
As it is food. we had it in the fridge.

714
00:42:33.208 --> 00:42:34.791
Many presents. María. huh?

715
00:42:34.875 --> 00:42:37.458
No. you can take all this. I can't eat it.

716
00:42:37.541 --> 00:42:40.666
Fede. see if you like anything.
otherwise they can take it.

717
00:42:43.333 --> 00:42:44.708
They sent <i>vitel toné</i>.

718
00:42:45.416 --> 00:42:46.500
Mozzarella sticks.

719
00:42:46.583 --> 00:42:47.958
-No.
-I can't believe it.

720
00:42:48.041 --> 00:42:49.625
-Carrot cake.
-No.

721
00:42:49.708 --> 00:42:51.333
-And this one?
-What's that?

722
00:42:52.083 --> 00:42:53.708
A strawberry and custard cake.

723
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:57.500
-Tomy might like this.
-You might like it.

724
00:42:59.041 --> 00:43:02.166
Take everything. but leave that one
for this man. who'll eat it all.

725
00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:06.791
Thank you very much.

726
00:43:06.875 --> 00:43:08.791
We'll share it with the other nurses.

727
00:43:08.875 --> 00:43:10.250
-Okay.
-Thanks.

728
00:43:10.333 --> 00:43:11.916
-See you later.
-See you later.

729
00:43:15.333 --> 00:43:16.583
-Hey. Marie.
-Yes.

730
00:43:17.875 --> 00:43:20.083
They've requested three more interviews.

731
00:43:20.166 --> 00:43:21.750
No. it's enough.

732
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:25.041
No way. See what you can say
to get out of them.

733
00:43:25.583 --> 00:43:26.583
It's been enough.

734
00:43:27.083 --> 00:43:27.916
Okay.

735
00:43:29.375 --> 00:43:32.375
You have such good timing
to become famous. huh?

736
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:34.375
It's like a joke.

737
00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:38.458
I'm going to talk to Néstor
from the city council. remember?

738
00:43:39.458 --> 00:43:41.500
Maybe he can get me a disability permit.

739
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.250
so I don't have to struggle
to find a parking spot

740
00:43:44.333 --> 00:43:46.041
or spend money on paid lots.

741
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:48.000
-Okay.
-Bye.

742
00:43:49.125 --> 00:43:51.125
-Will you go limping?
-Yes.

743
00:43:51.208 --> 00:43:52.041
Like this.

744
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:55.625
Can you bring Tomy?

745
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:58.083
Maru will bring him today.

746
00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:18.541
<i>We met in December 1991.</i>
<i>and we've been together ever since.</i>

747
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.375
Long live love!

748
00:44:22.125 --> 00:44:24.875
<i>I couldn't wish you</i>
<i>anything better. my child.</i>

749
00:44:25.458 --> 00:44:27.375
<i>than finding a love like this in life.</i>

750
00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:28.416
Kiss!

751
00:44:29.125 --> 00:44:31.000
Two against one. get it?

752
00:44:31.083 --> 00:44:34.250
<i>Special. passionate. tempestuous.</i>

753
00:44:35.083 --> 00:44:36.125
Score!

754
00:44:38.416 --> 00:44:40.166
<i>Unique. loving.</i>

755
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:46.083
<i>A loving love. Mom. you're so silly.</i>

756
00:44:54.875 --> 00:44:56.500
How was your night?

757
00:44:56.583 --> 00:44:58.500
Not so good. I vomited a bit.

758
00:44:58.583 --> 00:45:00.416
-Did you eat anything?
-Strawberries.

759
00:45:00.916 --> 00:45:02.500
-My bad.
-No.

760
00:45:03.416 --> 00:45:04.250
It's okay.

761
00:45:04.958 --> 00:45:06.750
But since you're vomiting.

762
00:45:06.833 --> 00:45:09.583
there's a risk of inhaling it
and getting it in your lungs.

763
00:45:10.083 --> 00:45:12.958
So. we're going to ask
for a nasogastric tube.

764
00:45:13.041 --> 00:45:13.875
Okay.

765
00:45:13.958 --> 00:45:17.250
It's a little annoying at first.
but you'll get used to it.

766
00:45:19.708 --> 00:45:22.750
Yesterday you were telling me about
your family trip to Europe.

767
00:45:29.958 --> 00:45:31.958
Maybe it's time for the sedation?

768
00:45:33.041 --> 00:45:33.875
Maybe.

769
00:45:34.416 --> 00:45:36.750
You'll know when it's time.

770
00:45:40.458 --> 00:45:42.458
I'm finishing Tomy's notebook.

771
00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:45.500
I have some pages left. Ten pages maybe.

772
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.791
Next week. perhaps.

773
00:45:51.416 --> 00:45:54.125
Well. you tell me. and we'll set a date.

774
00:46:00.375 --> 00:46:01.666
And what will it be like?

775
00:46:03.416 --> 00:46:06.125
Just like a regular day.
You won't even notice.

776
00:46:08.208 --> 00:46:10.375
We increase your morphine dose.

777
00:46:10.458 --> 00:46:13.708
we add Midazolam.
a hypnotic drug. and you go to sleep.

778
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.291
And I don't wake up again?

779
00:46:17.958 --> 00:46:19.291
We monitor you.

780
00:46:19.375 --> 00:46:22.250
and we give you the proper dose
so you won't wake up.

781
00:46:31.208 --> 00:46:33.708
Start thinking about
who you want to say goodbye to.

782
00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:37.750
I hadn't thought about that.

783
00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:27.708
At night. with the candles lit.
it will look great.

784
00:47:27.791 --> 00:47:30.958
Yes. Why don't we take pictures
and post them?

785
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.500
Or is it too much?

786
00:47:34.083 --> 00:47:34.958
No…

787
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:50.083
Come in.

788
00:47:50.583 --> 00:47:52.666
-I want to talk to you.
-What is it?

789
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:55.625
How is she?

790
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.333
Charlie…

791
00:47:58.458 --> 00:48:00.208
What did the doctor say?

792
00:48:00.291 --> 00:48:01.666
Nothing. what would he say?

793
00:48:02.166 --> 00:48:05.958
Sometimes doctors consult each other.
they talk among themselves.

794
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:09.875
-You brought a present?
-I did.

795
00:48:09.958 --> 00:48:11.666
She said she didn't want presents.

796
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:14.833
It's two Puck books
that complete her collection. that's all.

797
00:48:14.916 --> 00:48:16.625
Well. come on.

798
00:48:20.416 --> 00:48:21.333
She's asleep.

799
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.000
With everything they give her…

800
00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:26.791
We're going to the cafeteria
to let her rest a bit.

801
00:48:26.875 --> 00:48:28.333
I'll be there in a minute.

802
00:48:31.833 --> 00:48:33.458
-See you.
-Hi.

803
00:48:54.291 --> 00:48:56.291
-I thought you were sleeping.
-No.

804
00:48:57.041 --> 00:48:58.416
What do you have there?

805
00:48:59.125 --> 00:48:59.958
A burger.

806
00:49:00.791 --> 00:49:02.875
I'll eat it outside later.
not to tempt you.

807
00:49:02.958 --> 00:49:04.916
No. it doesn't make me hungry.

808
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:06.333
Hi.

809
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:08.375
Eat it here.

810
00:49:08.458 --> 00:49:11.333
-I also brought some things you asked for.
-Good.

811
00:49:12.666 --> 00:49:16.458
I was reading this book
Charlie gave me for my birthday.

812
00:49:16.541 --> 00:49:18.250
The two Puck books I was missing.

813
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:20.750
I can't believe that he remembered.

814
00:49:22.291 --> 00:49:23.291
He's a genius.

815
00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:27.208
PUCK WINS

816
00:49:28.333 --> 00:49:31.041
-Did you swing by the house?
-Yes. Rosa had been there.

817
00:49:31.125 --> 00:49:32.416
Did you pay her?

818
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.541
No. she said to pay
all together next week.

819
00:49:35.375 --> 00:49:36.708
She sends her regards.

820
00:49:36.791 --> 00:49:37.708
What else?

821
00:49:37.791 --> 00:49:39.791
I paid your phone. mine.

822
00:49:39.875 --> 00:49:42.041
Both with a fine
because they were past due.

823
00:49:43.666 --> 00:49:45.875
The window in Tomy's room still leaks.

824
00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:48.291
So. as soon as I have time.

825
00:49:48.375 --> 00:49:50.166
I'll take it out and seal it again.

826
00:49:50.958 --> 00:49:51.833
Okay.

827
00:49:52.916 --> 00:49:55.708
The plants are perfect.
They send their regards too.

828
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:59.791
-Take a picture of them.
-I will.

829
00:50:00.666 --> 00:50:04.750
I gave the kindergarten principal a gift.
She really helped with the absenteeism.

830
00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:10.416
Fede. shall we set a date?

831
00:50:17.708 --> 00:50:19.875
-Have you talked to Vigna?
-I have.

832
00:50:22.208 --> 00:50:24.416
He told me we could set a date
whenever I want.

833
00:50:25.875 --> 00:50:26.708
Okay.

834
00:50:27.875 --> 00:50:29.166
It could be on Friday.

835
00:50:30.541 --> 00:50:31.500
What do you think?

836
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:35.625
Okay.

837
00:50:37.291 --> 00:50:39.041
We have to talk with Tomy first.

838
00:50:39.958 --> 00:50:41.583
Tomorrow or after tomorrow.

839
00:50:50.958 --> 00:50:52.750
<i>Every agreement has a catch.</i>

840
00:50:54.333 --> 00:50:57.583
<i>Back then. Fede agreed to be with me</i>
<i>until death did us part.</i>

841
00:50:57.666 --> 00:50:58.500
Federico!

842
00:50:58.583 --> 00:51:00.375
<i>But he didn't read the small print.</i>

843
00:51:00.958 --> 00:51:01.833
How are you?

844
00:51:01.916 --> 00:51:04.750
I need you to get a notary
to certify that María consents

845
00:51:04.833 --> 00:51:06.083
to her terminal sedation.

846
00:51:06.166 --> 00:51:07.583
-Was there a problem?
-No.

847
00:51:07.666 --> 00:51:10.625
-It's good to have something like that.
-Where do I get a notary?

848
00:51:10.708 --> 00:51:13.541
Ask Reception.
They know a clerk's office in the area.

849
00:51:13.625 --> 00:51:16.208
-Does he have to come?
-They know what to do.

850
00:51:16.291 --> 00:51:19.208
-I'll go now so I don't lose time.
-Let me know. I'll stay late.

851
00:51:20.916 --> 00:51:24.041
<i>He probably never imagined</i>
<i>that that moment would arrive so soon.</i>

852
00:51:25.333 --> 00:51:26.458
<i>But this is it for me.</i>

853
00:51:27.791 --> 00:51:29.958
-Which floor is the clerk's office?
-Third.

854
00:51:30.041 --> 00:51:30.875
Thanks.

855
00:51:34.583 --> 00:51:37.041
<i>I'd rather he took me to Paris.</i>

856
00:51:37.708 --> 00:51:40.666
<i>but right now</i>
<i>the best present he can give me</i>

857
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:42.083
<i>is arranging my death.</i>

858
00:51:43.833 --> 00:51:44.666
Hello.

859
00:51:45.291 --> 00:51:48.333
-Good afternoon.
-I'm looking for Mr. Ceruolo.

860
00:51:48.416 --> 00:51:49.583
Senior or junior?

861
00:51:49.666 --> 00:51:52.166
Either is fine.
It's about a certification.

862
00:51:53.666 --> 00:51:55.791
Take a seat. I'll let him know.

863
00:51:55.875 --> 00:51:57.125
-Thanks.
-Wait here.

864
00:51:59.125 --> 00:52:03.291
<i>I don't think I've ever seen</i>
<i>such an act of love in my life.</i>

865
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.375
Please. come in.

866
00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.458
Thank you. Excuse me.

867
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.000
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

868
00:52:13.083 --> 00:52:15.541
-How are you? Take a seat. please.
-Excuse me.

869
00:52:15.625 --> 00:52:16.708
How can I help you?

870
00:52:16.791 --> 00:52:18.833
My wife is hospitalized
a few blocks away.

871
00:52:18.916 --> 00:52:21.041
and I need you to certify
an authorization.

872
00:52:21.125 --> 00:52:22.333
Do you have the paper?

873
00:52:22.416 --> 00:52:23.833
No. I don't have anything.

874
00:52:25.291 --> 00:52:28.291
It's a deed.
so I need to take the printed text.

875
00:52:28.375 --> 00:52:30.291
Right. But nobody told me anything.

876
00:52:30.375 --> 00:52:31.791
Well. let's see.

877
00:52:32.541 --> 00:52:36.583
go to the hospital and tell them
to help you. to give you a sample.

878
00:52:36.666 --> 00:52:38.541
-Okay?
-Okay. I'll go there and come back.

879
00:52:38.625 --> 00:52:41.166
No. not now. It's late.

880
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.041
-It has to be tomorrow. Okay?
-Could it be after hours?

881
00:52:46.333 --> 00:52:48.791
What is it about? Is it urgent?

882
00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:54.250
My wife is dying. and I need her to sign
the authorization for terminal sedation.

883
00:52:56.708 --> 00:52:57.583
Okay.

884
00:52:58.291 --> 00:52:59.291
I'll wait for you.

885
00:52:59.791 --> 00:53:01.083
Let's do this.

886
00:53:01.166 --> 00:53:03.833
Here's my card. Go do what you have to.

887
00:53:03.916 --> 00:53:07.041
I'll stay here for a while.
If you are delayed. call me.

888
00:53:07.125 --> 00:53:09.041
-Thank you very much.
-No. please.

889
00:53:09.125 --> 00:53:09.958
No problem.

890
00:53:13.333 --> 00:53:15.083
My clothes are all yours.

891
00:53:15.833 --> 00:53:18.416
Make a first selection. They're all yours.

892
00:53:19.083 --> 00:53:22.000
My mom's wedding dress. her bags.

893
00:53:22.083 --> 00:53:24.708
antique jewelry. that's all yours.

894
00:53:25.375 --> 00:53:27.916
Then. you can donate
or give away the rest.

895
00:53:28.541 --> 00:53:29.583
Or throw it away.

896
00:53:30.125 --> 00:53:31.541
Do whatever you want.

897
00:53:32.166 --> 00:53:35.291
Give my embroideries to Vera.
She'll know what to do.

898
00:53:37.125 --> 00:53:39.958
Makeup. your call.

899
00:53:42.166 --> 00:53:45.875
Give my Puck collection to Agus.
Paula's daughter.

900
00:53:47.625 --> 00:53:49.875
Oh. this. Throw things away.

901
00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:53.708
Do it mercilessly. Fede won't be able to.

902
00:53:53.791 --> 00:53:56.375
You throw things away. Whatever doesn't…

903
00:53:57.333 --> 00:53:58.458
This is important.

904
00:53:58.541 --> 00:54:02.083
There's a Trío los Panchos CD.
"Historia de un Amor."

905
00:54:03.125 --> 00:54:05.333
It's our song from when we met.

906
00:54:05.416 --> 00:54:08.875
the one he made me listen to
in the early days of our relationship.

907
00:54:08.958 --> 00:54:10.958
Get it. make it disappear.

908
00:54:11.458 --> 00:54:15.875
I know Fede will find it. listen to it.
and he'll feel terribly down.

909
00:54:17.458 --> 00:54:19.666
Wasn't your song "Contigo Aprendí"?

910
00:54:20.875 --> 00:54:22.500
-No.
-Manzanero's song.

911
00:54:22.583 --> 00:54:25.208
No. Don't throw away the wrong CD.

912
00:54:25.291 --> 00:54:28.125
No. no. Fine. "Historia de un Amor."

913
00:54:28.208 --> 00:54:31.083
Give a good gift to Dr. Molina.

914
00:54:31.166 --> 00:54:32.000
Okay.

915
00:54:32.625 --> 00:54:33.666
Molina.

916
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:36.708
The nurses. Give them gifts too.

917
00:54:39.125 --> 00:54:41.500
Charlie gets the dryer.

918
00:54:42.375 --> 00:54:44.916
-He's really happy.
-It's the best present.

919
00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:55.666
<i>You're no longer by my side. love</i>

920
00:54:57.125 --> 00:55:00.000
<i>I only have loneliness in my soul</i>

921
00:55:01.416 --> 00:55:03.791
Well. stop. It'll bring you down too.

922
00:55:06.333 --> 00:55:08.041
I'm done. That's it.

923
00:55:09.041 --> 00:55:09.875
Okay?

924
00:55:18.458 --> 00:55:22.208
Dr. Vigna.
please come to Information.

925
00:55:22.291 --> 00:55:23.750
-He'll be here.
-Thanks.

926
00:55:38.833 --> 00:55:40.125
Doctor. how are you?

927
00:55:40.208 --> 00:55:41.041
Doctor.

928
00:55:42.333 --> 00:55:44.125
I need the paper María has to sign.

929
00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:46.750
No. forget about that.
Come. the director is waiting.

930
00:55:46.833 --> 00:55:49.208
-What happened?
-Nothing that can't be solved.

931
00:55:49.291 --> 00:55:50.291
Another problem?

932
00:55:50.375 --> 00:55:52.916
Don't worry. leave it to me.
I'll handle it.

933
00:56:00.166 --> 00:56:01.791
Say "yes" to everything he says.

934
00:56:03.375 --> 00:56:06.791
Well. Federico.
you know we love María a lot.

935
00:56:06.875 --> 00:56:08.625
and we love you a lot too.

936
00:56:09.208 --> 00:56:13.500
We think the fortitude you're showing
in this situation is remarkable.

937
00:56:13.583 --> 00:56:17.291
That's why we try to make you feel
as comfortable as possible.

938
00:56:17.375 --> 00:56:18.958
-Right. Doctor?
-Yes. of course.

939
00:56:20.083 --> 00:56:22.208
Thank you for that. I mean it.

940
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:24.625
But there's a delicate issue here.

941
00:56:25.416 --> 00:56:30.708
You know that the line between euthanasia
and terminal sedation is very thin

942
00:56:30.791 --> 00:56:33.458
and gives rise
to multiple interpretations.

943
00:56:33.541 --> 00:56:36.000
In fact. there are
many colleagues. professionals.

944
00:56:36.083 --> 00:56:38.625
who do not agree with terminal sedation.

945
00:56:39.166 --> 00:56:42.375
Yes. I think that
due to a semantic issue.

946
00:56:42.458 --> 00:56:45.791
we should call it
"compassionate sedation." not "terminal."

947
00:56:47.166 --> 00:56:48.000
Yes.

948
00:56:48.666 --> 00:56:51.291
The Death With Dignity Act states

949
00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:54.666
that terminal sedation
must be proposed by the physician

950
00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:57.708
in consent with the patient
or his or her relatives.

951
00:56:57.791 --> 00:57:00.500
in case he or she
is in no condition to decide.

952
00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.750
the day the pain becomes unbearable

953
00:57:02.833 --> 00:57:05.916
or when the procedures to fight it
are not working.

954
00:57:06.625 --> 00:57:10.083
But we cannot say
we're going to do it in five days.

955
00:57:10.625 --> 00:57:13.625
Because that would imply
that the patient can live with the pain.

956
00:57:13.708 --> 00:57:18.166
that it's not unbearable
and that less extreme methods are working.

957
00:57:21.625 --> 00:57:25.708
Look. Federico. this is a regular practice
in this clinic. Right. Doctor?

958
00:57:25.791 --> 00:57:27.583
Yes. it's regular.

959
00:57:27.666 --> 00:57:29.875
But in María's case.
she's a public figure.

960
00:57:29.958 --> 00:57:32.291
<i>Clarín's </i>front page. TV interviews<i>.</i>

961
00:57:32.958 --> 00:57:36.583
All that social media stuff going viral.
People confuse everything.

962
00:57:36.666 --> 00:57:40.000
I wouldn't be surprised if someone thought
that we're actually performing…

963
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:41.375
euthanasia.

964
00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:44.291
Excuse me. I have to take this.

965
00:57:50.666 --> 00:57:51.541
Listen. Federico.

966
00:57:52.625 --> 00:57:53.875
If she were my wife.

967
00:57:54.458 --> 00:57:58.041
I'd take her home and get someone
to administer her terminal sedation.

968
00:57:58.958 --> 00:58:01.375
And I'm not telling you this
as the hospital director.

969
00:58:03.208 --> 00:58:05.375
What are you going to do?
Take her home?

970
00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:09.458
That's what the director said.
If she were his wife.

971
00:58:09.541 --> 00:58:10.750
he'd sedate her at home.

972
00:58:10.833 --> 00:58:11.666
Well…

973
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:14.458
I think he said that to show off.

974
00:58:14.541 --> 00:58:15.666
What did Vigna say?

975
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:17.958
That he'll take care of it.

976
00:58:18.458 --> 00:58:21.291
He's the head physician.
He must be able to do something.

977
00:58:21.375 --> 00:58:22.791
Let's leave it to Vigna.

978
00:58:25.833 --> 00:58:27.166
I'll call Adrián.

979
00:58:27.833 --> 00:58:28.958
Adrián?

980
00:58:29.041 --> 00:58:31.166
Adrián is a dietitian. Fede.

981
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:33.458
What is he going to say?
What can he do?

982
00:58:33.541 --> 00:58:35.125
He's a dietitian.
but a doctor too.

983
00:58:35.208 --> 00:58:37.041
That has nothing to do with this.

984
00:58:37.125 --> 00:58:39.291
A dietitian…

985
00:58:41.208 --> 00:58:43.166
Why don't they sedate her in the hospital?

986
00:58:43.666 --> 00:58:45.833
Because of all that mess I told you about.

987
00:58:46.916 --> 00:58:48.666
She doesn't deserve to live like this.

988
00:58:49.166 --> 00:58:50.166
Of course not.

989
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.541
Will you take her home?

990
00:58:52.625 --> 00:58:54.125
Yes. that's the idea.

991
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.375
Come. let's sit inside.

992
00:58:58.458 --> 00:59:00.083
Where are you going with this junk?

993
00:59:00.791 --> 00:59:02.958
Up north. To Jujuy in the summer.

994
00:59:03.458 --> 00:59:05.791
-You won't get far with this.
-You think so?

995
00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:08.250
Come back in a few months
and check it out then.

996
00:59:09.416 --> 00:59:10.833
I don't see it happening.

997
00:59:14.291 --> 00:59:15.416
Look. Fede.

998
00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:18.583
at-home sedation is not that simple.
you know?

999
00:59:19.291 --> 00:59:21.125
You don't sedate her and be done.

1000
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:24.166
You have to be there.
you have to monitor her.

1001
00:59:24.666 --> 00:59:26.458
You have to administer the drugs.

1002
00:59:27.458 --> 00:59:28.875
You have to keep her asleep

1003
00:59:28.958 --> 00:59:32.333
and at the same time start reducing
her hydration. Do you understand?

1004
00:59:35.416 --> 00:59:39.500
That could take five. six.
seven days. Even longer.

1005
00:59:43.833 --> 00:59:45.083
What a bummer. right?

1006
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:49.041
-Is there anything faster?
-Euthanasia is faster.

1007
00:59:50.958 --> 00:59:53.541
I can get you a doctor
to help you. if you want.

1008
00:59:55.666 --> 00:59:56.750
No.

1009
00:59:57.916 --> 00:59:59.458
When all this started.

1010
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:02.791
I promised Marie that if someone
had to do it. it would be me.

1011
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:08.833
-Explain it to me.
-Okay.

1012
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.166
Well. look. If you take her home.

1013
01:00:15.041 --> 01:00:19.041
ask the hospital people
to send her with a central IV line.

1014
01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:22.875
It's a catheter that is inserted
in one of the large veins

1015
01:00:22.958 --> 01:00:24.416
that lead to the heart.

1016
01:00:25.416 --> 01:00:28.500
-What if she already has it?
-No. she definitely doesn't.

1017
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
But they'll realize if I ask them that.

1018
01:00:33.083 --> 01:00:35.125
There's no one you trust at the hospital?

1019
01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:36.666
No. not for that.

1020
01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:38.166
I don't know…

1021
01:00:38.875 --> 01:00:39.708
Let me…

1022
01:00:42.625 --> 01:00:44.583
And once she has that. then what?

1023
01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:49.666
Once she has that. you go to a pharmacy
and ask for potassium chloride.

1024
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.541
-Potassium chloride.
-Hi. Fede.

1025
01:00:52.625 --> 01:00:55.541
-How's Marie doing?
-Hi. Estela. She's hanging on.

1026
01:00:56.125 --> 01:00:57.500
I have to visit her.

1027
01:00:58.083 --> 01:01:00.666
Maybe I'll make some time
and go see her this week.

1028
01:01:01.666 --> 01:01:02.791
I'm going to your mom's.

1029
01:01:03.291 --> 01:01:05.166
-Okay. I'll pick you up later.
-Okay.

1030
01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:07.458
-Send her a kiss.
-I will.

1031
01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:13.250
-What should I ask for?
-Potassium chloride.

1032
01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:16.250
-They'll just give it to me?
-It's an over-the-counter medicine.

1033
01:01:16.333 --> 01:01:19.125
It's used for diarrhea. vomiting.
It'll be fine.

1034
01:01:19.666 --> 01:01:22.750
Once you have it. bring it to me.
I'll prepare the syringe.

1035
01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:25.958
You just have to inject it
in the catheter.

1036
01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:30.000
Will you dare do it?

1037
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.333
I will.

1038
01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:35.791
Does it come up
in an autopsy or something?

1039
01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:37.500
If they do an autopsy. it does.

1040
01:01:38.375 --> 01:01:41.750
But who requests an autopsy
for someone who died of terminal cancer?

1041
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:46.916
And if they don't give her the central IV?

1042
01:01:47.416 --> 01:01:50.750
You have to put the potassium
directly in the IV dispenser.

1043
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.208
It's slower.

1044
01:01:53.041 --> 01:01:55.583
Try to get them
to put the central line in.

1045
01:01:55.666 --> 01:01:58.166
It's faster.
It goes straight to the heart.

1046
01:02:00.541 --> 01:02:01.375
Doctor.

1047
01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:04.416
-Yes. how are you?
-May I speak with you?

1048
01:02:05.291 --> 01:02:07.833
Take it to the lab.
I'll see you there. Yes.

1049
01:02:08.375 --> 01:02:11.791
-We're going home.
-Talk to Dr. Vigna about it.

1050
01:02:11.875 --> 01:02:14.833
Yes. of course. But I need you
to put a central line in her.

1051
01:02:14.916 --> 01:02:16.416
A central line? What for?

1052
01:02:16.958 --> 01:02:19.583
For… medications.
in case she needs them. I guess.

1053
01:02:19.666 --> 01:02:20.875
Who told you that?

1054
01:02:21.458 --> 01:02:24.625
Her clinician. our family doctor.

1055
01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:27.458
No. have him call us.
We can't put in a central line.

1056
01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:30.500
There has to be a medical reason for it.

1057
01:02:31.041 --> 01:02:32.000
Have him call us.

1058
01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:33.416
Okay.

1059
01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:34.875
Thanks.

1060
01:02:55.625 --> 01:02:56.875
What did Adrián say?

1061
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.333
-Do you remember what we talked about?
-I do.

1062
01:03:01.916 --> 01:03:04.583
That if someone had to do it.
it had to be me.

1063
01:03:04.666 --> 01:03:05.500
Yes.

1064
01:03:06.208 --> 01:03:07.458
It's a little potassium.

1065
01:03:08.458 --> 01:03:09.375
It's immediate.

1066
01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:13.708
Adrián prepares the syringe.
and I put it in your IV.

1067
01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:17.625
What if they find out?

1068
01:03:18.625 --> 01:03:20.500
That's impossible. Marie.

1069
01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:22.083
Adrián…

1070
01:03:23.125 --> 01:03:24.125
Adrián told me.

1071
01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:27.750
They don't do autopsies
on cancer patients.

1072
01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:33.666
Isn't it better if we go home?

1073
01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:35.041
Yes.

1074
01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:37.333
We go home and do it there.

1075
01:03:40.125 --> 01:03:44.125
But if we go home and I die the next day.
they'll catch us. They're not stupid.

1076
01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:50.375
And Tomy loses both his parents
because you can go to jail.

1077
01:03:50.458 --> 01:03:51.333
It's no good.

1078
01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:55.916
Are you drunk?
Did you drink a whole bottle of whiskey?

1079
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.666
-What do you mean you're gonna kill her?
-Yes. I will.

1080
01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.958
We talked when this started.

1081
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.125
She can't be here 5 more months.
And say goodbye 100 times?

1082
01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.833
Who told you she'll be here five months?

1083
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:10.250
Five. ten days.
It's the same. it's torture.

1084
01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:12.708
She can't be like this.
She's put to sleep. wakes up.

1085
01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:19.666
Someone has to give her
that damn potassium.

1086
01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:23.208
Tell me I'm right.

1087
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:26.000
I'm not crazy.
I can't see her suffer like that.

1088
01:04:26.083 --> 01:04:30.541
No. I know. I know you have to kill her.
but it sounds harsh when you say it.

1089
01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:34.125
Have you talked to that doctor.
Vigna. the chief?

1090
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:37.250
I don't want to get him involved.

1091
01:04:37.333 --> 01:04:40.208
-He said he'd take care of it.
-He did to get me off his back.

1092
01:04:48.458 --> 01:04:50.708
-Federico. I was looking for you.
-How are you?

1093
01:04:50.791 --> 01:04:52.333
-I'll go with Marie.
-Okay.

1094
01:04:52.416 --> 01:04:55.791
Dr. Vigna told me
María has to sign this form

1095
01:04:56.291 --> 01:05:00.125
to decline receiving
resuscitation procedures. Okay?

1096
01:05:00.208 --> 01:05:04.250
Once she signs this.
he'll order the sedation for Friday.

1097
01:05:04.833 --> 01:05:05.708
Finally.

1098
01:05:06.666 --> 01:05:07.750
It's been a nightmare.

1099
01:05:08.583 --> 01:05:11.083
Do we need the notary
to come for the signing?

1100
01:05:11.166 --> 01:05:13.500
No. her signature is enough.

1101
01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:15.666
But mind you. no social media.

1102
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:17.375
-No. of course.
-Good.

1103
01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:19.416
-Okay. thanks.
-No problem.

1104
01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:25.541
Marie. honey.

1105
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:28.208
You have to sign here.

1106
01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:30.041
-Where?
-There.

1107
01:05:30.708 --> 01:05:31.541
There.

1108
01:05:32.166 --> 01:05:33.000
There you go.

1109
01:05:33.916 --> 01:05:36.125
Sign there.
and they'll sedate you on Friday.

1110
01:05:37.291 --> 01:05:38.333
And that's it.

1111
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.833
Who authorizes this?

1112
01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:44.375
Vigna.

1113
01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:48.083
Done?

1114
01:05:49.208 --> 01:05:50.916
I'll go before he regrets it.

1115
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.666
-Calm down a bit.
-I'm in a hurry. What do you expect?

1116
01:06:02.666 --> 01:06:04.458
Will you organize my farewell?

1117
01:06:10.958 --> 01:06:11.958
There's Roxy.

1118
01:06:13.291 --> 01:06:14.458
-Hi.
-Hi.

1119
01:06:14.541 --> 01:06:15.375
Hi.

1120
01:06:16.041 --> 01:06:16.958
Am I the first?

1121
01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:18.250
No. Leti went first.

1122
01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:22.916
-How was it? What did you talk about?
-I don't know. What do you want me to say?

1123
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.291
-And you?
-No. I asked to go last.

1124
01:06:26.166 --> 01:06:29.041
But I don't know if I'll go in yet.

1125
01:06:31.083 --> 01:06:32.625
I don't know…

1126
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:34.958
Shit.

1127
01:06:35.541 --> 01:06:36.375
Okay.

1128
01:06:36.875 --> 01:06:39.583
-Have a Clonazepam.
-Yes. Can I have one more?

1129
01:06:39.666 --> 01:06:41.916
No. girl. two? You'll go in drooling.

1130
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.541
But she cries a lot.
Maybe I could give her another one.

1131
01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:47.500
-You could take one when you go out.
-Yes. or later.

1132
01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:48.916
-I'd rather…
-It's a lot.

1133
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.583
-I'll give it to you later.
-Okay. I'll go upstairs.

1134
01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:53.833
Good luck.

1135
01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:07.958
Hello. Roxy.

1136
01:07:08.708 --> 01:07:09.708
Hello. Marie.

1137
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:17.250
I'm an asshole.

1138
01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.291
They told me a thousand times.

1139
01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:20.208
I'm sorry.

1140
01:07:20.666 --> 01:07:22.916
There. Roxy. there.

1141
01:07:29.541 --> 01:07:30.541
I never…

1142
01:07:30.625 --> 01:07:33.708
It's the first time
I've had a farewell like this.

1143
01:07:35.416 --> 01:07:37.083
Well. don't worry.

1144
01:07:38.125 --> 01:07:40.083
It's the first time I'm dying too.

1145
01:07:43.541 --> 01:07:45.166
You're always the same.

1146
01:07:46.125 --> 01:07:46.958
Look.

1147
01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.291
I also got a tattoo.

1148
01:07:53.416 --> 01:07:55.416
I'll remember you always.

1149
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:59.708
When I get changed.
when I take a shower. when I fuck.

1150
01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:11.000
Whenever you have some free time.
take Tomy out.

1151
01:08:12.541 --> 01:08:14.166
Okay? Take Tomy for a walk.

1152
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:15.833
-Remember.
-Yes.

1153
01:08:19.166 --> 01:08:20.541
Say hello to your mom.

1154
01:08:36.875 --> 01:08:37.750
Excuse me.

1155
01:08:39.208 --> 01:08:40.333
Come here. Charlie.

1156
01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:59.791
I don't know how to say goodbye.
How? How do we do this?

1157
01:09:03.791 --> 01:09:05.708
It's a pleasure to have met you.

1158
01:09:06.958 --> 01:09:08.458
I don't know. Just that.

1159
01:09:14.291 --> 01:09:16.875
-And how is the construction going?
-It's halted.

1160
01:09:18.208 --> 01:09:20.333
Apparently. I have to get more money.

1161
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.208
You have to work. Charlie.
You have to work a lot. I mean it.

1162
01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:28.250
Make a lot of money. A lot of money.

1163
01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:31.833
I want to thank you for…

1164
01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.083
for all the years
of knowing each other because…

1165
01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:39.916
you are the only person
with whom I could be spontaneous.

1166
01:09:45.208 --> 01:09:46.708
I'm an atheist. like you.

1167
01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:48.250
But…

1168
01:09:51.208 --> 01:09:52.916
if there is an afterlife…

1169
01:09:54.416 --> 01:09:56.458
send me signs.

1170
01:09:57.666 --> 01:09:58.500
I don't know…

1171
01:09:59.416 --> 01:10:00.791
Write to me…

1172
01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:05.166
on a misty mirror in the bathroom.

1173
01:10:08.166 --> 01:10:10.375
Or in that little notebook you gave me.

1174
01:10:10.458 --> 01:10:12.625
lined in fabric. Write to me there.

1175
01:10:14.583 --> 01:10:15.666
Write something.

1176
01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:35.000
Why don't you go. Charlie.
if you have stuff to do? Just go.

1177
01:10:35.791 --> 01:10:37.916
No. I canceled everything today.

1178
01:10:44.125 --> 01:10:45.250
It's D-Day.

1179
01:10:48.458 --> 01:10:49.791
-Lucho.
-Hi.

1180
01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:51.708
Hi. Mom. how are you?

1181
01:10:51.791 --> 01:10:52.958
-Fine.
-Hello. honey.

1182
01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.750
-Hi.
-Do you want us to go with you. Fede?

1183
01:10:55.833 --> 01:10:57.458
No. you'll go later.

1184
01:10:57.541 --> 01:10:59.458
Besides.
I'm leaving Tomy alone with Marie.

1185
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:00.833
Have a seat.

1186
01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:13.250
It's a little button that's there
in case someone needs help.

1187
01:11:14.416 --> 01:11:16.083
You press it. it rings a bell.

1188
01:11:16.583 --> 01:11:19.583
and that bell
makes someone come and repair it.

1189
01:11:21.833 --> 01:11:23.125
Did it go crazy?

1190
01:11:23.625 --> 01:11:24.625
A little.

1191
01:11:24.708 --> 01:11:25.791
-A little?
-Yes.

1192
01:11:25.875 --> 01:11:27.875
Not a lot?

1193
01:11:27.958 --> 01:11:29.708
Hello.

1194
01:11:30.208 --> 01:11:32.666
-Hello.
-Hello!

1195
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:34.083
Hello!

1196
01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:35.916
-Hello.
-There.

1197
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.375
Hello.

1198
01:11:40.583 --> 01:11:43.083
-Hello.
-I'll be outside if you need anything.

1199
01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:44.458
-Let me know.
-Okay.

1200
01:11:47.291 --> 01:11:50.416
-Hi.
-Who is the skull guy?

1201
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.250
-Right?
-I thought…

1202
01:12:14.416 --> 01:12:15.583
Which one is it?

1203
01:12:18.375 --> 01:12:19.208
That one?

1204
01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:21.458
Fried egg face.

1205
01:12:24.291 --> 01:12:25.541
Tangerine face?

1206
01:12:28.125 --> 01:12:29.166
I guessed it!

1207
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.666
Now it’s my turn. Focus.

1208
01:12:34.625 --> 01:12:38.250
Let’s see if you can guess this one.
It’s a hard one.

1209
01:12:38.333 --> 01:12:39.166
Yes.

1210
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:43.750
It's…

1211
01:12:44.791 --> 01:12:46.583
It's banana face.

1212
01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:48.750
Banana. Now you.

1213
01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:51.458
And that face?

1214
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:54.875
Is it bitter?

1215
01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:58.083
Grapefruit?

1216
01:12:59.916 --> 01:13:01.958
-Really?
-You have a star now.

1217
01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:06.041
-Yes. because I won.
-No. you have no stars.

1218
01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:07.875
None? No stars?

1219
01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:12.125
-Because you lost.
-And where do you go when you lose?

1220
01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.000
Nowhere. you stay here. To play.

1221
01:13:21.916 --> 01:13:24.750
<i>I could never explain to you</i>
<i>how much I love you.</i>

1222
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:27.916
<i>the joy of seeing your expressions…</i>

1223
01:13:28.958 --> 01:13:31.375
<i>and the anger I feel</i>
<i>for having left so soon.</i>

1224
01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:35.958
<i>But living includes dying.</i>
<i>and often in a way that is…</i>

1225
01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:39.541
<i>Unfair? Unnecessary?</i>

1226
01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:42.333
<i>Well. there are worse deaths.</i>

1227
01:13:42.416 --> 01:13:46.000
<i>lives without love.</i>
<i>joy. passion or anything.</i>

1228
01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:48.625
<i>without Fede. Marie or Tomy.</i>

1229
01:13:50.041 --> 01:13:54.083
<i>This is a sad and sweet death.</i>
<i>Think about that.</i>

1230
01:13:54.916 --> 01:13:57.291
<i>You'll understand it. my little boy.</i>

1231
01:13:57.958 --> 01:13:58.958
<i>my okapi.</i>

1232
01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:09.416
Hello. good afternoon.

1233
01:14:10.125 --> 01:14:12.458
Can you wait a second? She's with our son.

1234
01:14:12.541 --> 01:14:15.083
-Yes.
-We'll be back at the end of the round.

1235
01:14:15.166 --> 01:14:16.791
Thanks a lot. You're very kind.

1236
01:14:17.375 --> 01:14:18.208
Thanks.

1237
01:15:08.666 --> 01:15:09.500
What time is it?

1238
01:15:10.083 --> 01:15:11.250
Almost 5:00 p.m.

1239
01:15:12.666 --> 01:15:14.416
Hey. she had 2.000 retweets.

1240
01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:27.083
-Hello. How are you?
-Hi. how are you?

1241
01:15:27.166 --> 01:15:28.166
-Everything okay?
-Yes.

1242
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:29.583
-Can I ask something?
-Yes.

1243
01:15:29.666 --> 01:15:32.291
-Does this dose have an immediate effect?
-What dose?

1244
01:15:32.375 --> 01:15:35.375
-The sedation dose.
-No. this is the regular dose.

1245
01:15:35.458 --> 01:15:37.958
Why the regular dose?
We agreed she'd be sedated.

1246
01:15:38.041 --> 01:15:39.250
Not that I know of.

1247
01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:42.458
She signed the form.

1248
01:15:43.416 --> 01:15:45.708
-You'd better talk to Dr. Molina.
-Where is she?

1249
01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:47.000
On the second floor.

1250
01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:49.041
I'll be right back.

1251
01:15:57.916 --> 01:16:00.666
Listen to me. Doctor.
Why won't you put her to sleep?

1252
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:04.208
You listen to me. I'm not willing
to cross certain boundaries.

1253
01:16:04.291 --> 01:16:07.791
-What boundaries are you talking about?
-The boundaries of my convictions.

1254
01:16:07.875 --> 01:16:09.833
Fine. I'll ask Dr. Diego Vigna

1255
01:16:09.916 --> 01:16:12.541
to send a person who's willing to do
what has to be done.

1256
01:16:12.625 --> 01:16:14.500
Fine. that's your decision.

1257
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.208
Doctor. I understand
and respect your position.

1258
01:16:18.291 --> 01:16:19.541
I do. Period.

1259
01:16:20.041 --> 01:16:21.833
But please try to understand me.

1260
01:16:21.916 --> 01:16:24.375
María can't keep living
under these conditions.

1261
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:28.166
Vomiting the few things she eats
with unbearable pain.

1262
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:32.041
If there was a slight hope.
let's say one in a thousand.

1263
01:16:32.125 --> 01:16:33.458
I'd agree with you.

1264
01:16:33.541 --> 01:16:35.041
But you know there isn't.

1265
01:16:35.708 --> 01:16:39.083
Look. life is sacred to me.
even in María's state.

1266
01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:41.500
I can kill pain. but not the person.

1267
01:16:42.166 --> 01:16:44.000
That's why I chose to be a doctor.

1268
01:16:49.625 --> 01:16:50.750
Excuse me a second.

1269
01:16:54.083 --> 01:16:54.916
Federico.

1270
01:16:56.083 --> 01:16:57.416
-How are you?
-What happened?

1271
01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:58.583
Let me tell you.

1272
01:16:58.666 --> 01:17:01.791
They are on to us.
It's not because of me or the director.

1273
01:17:01.875 --> 01:17:04.333
The hospital lawyer came
and was quite blunt.

1274
01:17:04.416 --> 01:17:06.833
He doesn't want
the terminal sedation for María.

1275
01:17:06.916 --> 01:17:09.833
If we do it and they ask
for her medical history. they'll notice.

1276
01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:11.875
-But it's not illegal.
-They panicked.

1277
01:17:11.958 --> 01:17:13.208
They fear the media.

1278
01:17:13.291 --> 01:17:15.541
They fear some unscrupulous reporter

1279
01:17:15.625 --> 01:17:17.916
publishing an article
accusing the hospital

1280
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.666
of performing undercover euthanasia.

1281
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:23.416
Imagine. "Hospital Kills a Patient."
That always sells.

1282
01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:26.166
-So. now what?
-No. relax.

1283
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.708
The difference is
what we could've done in two days.

1284
01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:32.583
we're gonna do in seven or eight.

1285
01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:34.791
So nobody suspects anything.

1286
01:17:35.625 --> 01:17:36.875
Won't she suffer?

1287
01:17:36.958 --> 01:17:40.000
No. Her brain's pain receptors
will be inhibited.

1288
01:17:40.583 --> 01:17:42.250
-But she's gonna be conscious?
-No.

1289
01:17:42.333 --> 01:17:44.458
She won't be conscious. She won't suffer.

1290
01:17:49.625 --> 01:17:52.625
These beautiful eyebrows.
Are they like Mom's?

1291
01:17:52.708 --> 01:17:54.416
-No.
-Like your dad's?

1292
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:55.333
No.

1293
01:17:55.958 --> 01:17:57.000
Like yours?

1294
01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.791
I ate a man.

1295
01:18:00.708 --> 01:18:02.000
-Did you know?
-Yes.

1296
01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.291
I was hungry. and I ate him.

1297
01:18:05.041 --> 01:18:06.333
I ate another fish.

1298
01:18:08.833 --> 01:18:10.500
I ate a lady!

1299
01:18:11.041 --> 01:18:12.458
I ate a lady.

1300
01:18:12.958 --> 01:18:14.333
I ate a fish.

1301
01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:16.916
Let's go to the next fish.

1302
01:18:17.666 --> 01:18:18.708
It escaped…

1303
01:18:20.916 --> 01:18:22.250
I'll eat it.

1304
01:18:23.083 --> 01:18:24.000
They killed me!

1305
01:18:25.625 --> 01:18:26.791
They killed me!

1306
01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:30.041
They killed me. I can't believe it.

1307
01:18:30.666 --> 01:18:32.333
-They killed you?
-They did.

1308
01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:34.500
-Oh!
-They killed me.

1309
01:18:35.041 --> 01:18:36.291
They are mean.

1310
01:18:37.166 --> 01:18:38.125
What a shame.

1311
01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:40.416
What a shame.

1312
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.166
What a shame. Jeez!

1313
01:19:22.041 --> 01:19:24.875
<i>Not ice cream. nor movies.</i>

1314
01:19:25.416 --> 01:19:27.916
<i>nor the pretty things.</i>
<i>nor the ugly things. </i>

1315
01:19:28.708 --> 01:19:30.500
<i>nor the leaves of the trees…</i>

1316
01:19:34.166 --> 01:19:37.875
<i>But I will be in your heart</i>
<i>until you aren't here anymore.</i>

1317
01:19:37.958 --> 01:19:40.291
<i>but you'll be</i>
<i>in other people's hearts.</i>

1318
01:19:40.833 --> 01:19:42.833
<i>And so nothing ever dies.</i>

1319
01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.541
<i>And something always lives on.</i>

1320
01:20:48.708 --> 01:20:53.041
<i>You're no longer by my side. love</i>

1321
01:20:53.875 --> 01:20:57.791
<i>I just have loneliness in my soul</i>

1322
01:20:58.625 --> 01:21:01.041
<i>And if I can no longer see you</i>

1323
01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:06.791
<i>Why did God make me love you?</i>
<i>To make me suffer more?</i>

1324
01:21:07.875 --> 01:21:12.041
<i>You always were my reason to live</i>

1325
01:21:13.125 --> 01:21:17.291
<i>Worshiping you was my religion</i>

1326
01:21:17.875 --> 01:21:20.291
<i>And in your kisses. I found</i>

1327
01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:26.125
<i>The heat of passion and love</i>

1328
01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:32.541
<i>It's the story of a love like no other</i>

1329
01:21:32.625 --> 01:21:37.041
<i>That made me understand good and evil</i>

1330
01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:41.875
<i>That gave light to my life</i>

1331
01:21:41.958 --> 01:21:46.291
<i>And then turned it off</i>

1332
01:21:46.375 --> 01:21:51.041
<i>Oh. what a dark life</i>

1333
01:21:51.125 --> 01:21:55.416
<i>I won't be able to live without your love</i>

1334
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.500
<i>It's the story of a love</i>
