00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.720
A NETFLIX COMEDY SPECIAL

4
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.160
I won't make it to 40.

5
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.680
Good evening. Come on. clap for me!

6
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.600
Clap like you would if I was naked!

7
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.600
Wow. such warmth. Such joy.

8
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.320
It feels like 2019.

9
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.760
Let me introduce myself. I'm tall. slim.

10
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.640
and have a foreign surname
that suggests charisma and mystery.

11
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.200
Yes. it is really me.

12
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.560
Emily Ratajkowski.

13
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.640
If you'd ordered her on Wish.
this is what you'd get.

14
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.000
When I die. I want her photo
on my tombstone.

15
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.800
I'll be dead anyway.

16
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.280
Who is she gonna sue?
The kids I don't have?

17
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.200
I'd love to have sons.

18
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.960
I'd love my sons to be obnubilated by me.

19
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.320
totally obsessed.

20
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.320
Like those men who look
at their partner after sex and say.

21
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.640
"You'll never be like my mother."

22
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.080
But daughters? Never.

23
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.520
I wouldn't want a thinner version of me
without mental health issues

24
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.760
to tell my husband.

25
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.360
"Daddy. can you buy me this?"

26
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.200
Go to work. you freeloader!

27
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.600
Even though you're five.

28
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.600
Let's hear it for female solidarity!

29
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.520
Anyhow. for those of you
who don't know me.

30
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.960
people who lack good taste.

31
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.360
I was born in Rome
on the 28th of July 1987.

32
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.040
Have you heard of Rome?

33
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.720
The city where we solve our issues
by setting them on fire.

34
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.080
Buses.

35
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.440
Old bridges. Rubbish.

36
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.080
People wishing to use contactless payment.
"Can I use my card?"

37
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.240
"If you want to…"

38
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.280
TV. Cinema. The Internet.

39
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.040
I've been everywhere. except for jail.

40
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.400
But it won't be long.

41
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.000
This year I finally signed up for VAT.
I'm living the dream.

42
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.480
Financial police. Living the dream.

43
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.600
I've worked my way up the ladder.

44
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.880
I have tolerated sexual harassment.
and I have harassed too.

45
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.520
And finally. I reached some of my goals.

46
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.000
I was featured on the list of 100
most successful women by <i>Forbes Italia.</i>

47
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.240
Now. you'd say. "Wow. Michela. not bad."

48
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.120
"You should be proud."

49
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.840
"Now you're famous.
I bet your life has changed."

50
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.000
"You finally turned a corner."

51
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.920
Nope.

52
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.440
When you become famous.
your life doesn't change.

53
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.520
You're still the same piece of shit.
but now everyone knows it.

54
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.160
Your life changes
if you wake up and you're a cat.

55
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.040
Thank fuck your life has changed.

56
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.440
Now you shit in a tray.

57
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.240
It's a different lifestyle.

58
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.560
I'm still doing the same things
I always did.

59
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.640
Every morning. I wake up.
and I check my profile

60
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.320
to see if the size of my belly

61
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.920
now resembles a Fiat Qubo.

62
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.920
I'm still doing the same things.

63
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.240
but I have many new problems.

64
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.520
I don't know. If I'm waiting in a deli

65
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.160
and there's an old lady

66
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.840
who's taking 40 minutes

67
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.880
to buy some gorgonzola cheese.
and I'm there…

68
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.160
She goes. "I'd like some gorgonzola!"

69
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.480
"Also. a little ham

70
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.760
for my grandson!"

71
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.240
"Also. a Pfizer booster!"

72
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.760
"And some more gorgonzola!"

73
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.560
"For fuck's sake. lady!"

74
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.960
"Leave some gorgonzola
for the rest of us."

75
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.160
"We want some too."

76
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.000
"If you want to scream like Robert Plant.
go sing 'Whole Lotta Love' outside

77
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.480
and fuck right off."

78
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.200
But if I say something like that.
the day after. news websites will claim

79
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.320
that I invented the Holocaust.

80
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.160
"Elderly people. Watch out
for COVID and Michela Giraud."

81
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.320
I hope nobody got offended here.

82
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.000
Are there elderly people here?

83
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.080
Are there

84
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.720
any Robert Plant fans?

85
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.920
Is Robert Plant here?

86
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.360
Great. so I didn't offend anyone. Great.

87
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.920
At least you're not
like Demi Lovato's fans.

88
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.680
When you're always in the media.

89
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.680
you have to watch what you say.

90
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.080
I speak from personal experience.

91
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.080
It was 2021 AD. in the month of May.

92
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.640
I read this story.

93
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.200
"Demi Lovato. 'I am non-binary.
I want to be addressed as 'they.'"

94
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.800
I have no clue what "non-binary" means.

95
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.120
I could google it.

96
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.520
but my fierce comedic brain turns on

97
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.960
and starts thinking
about that magician guy on TV.

98
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.080
Maybe you know him.

99
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.200
The Divine Otelma
has several humanities degrees.

100
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.600
He refers to himself by saying "we."
and he's a magician.

101
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.560
like anyone with a humanities degree.

102
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.080
So I came up with the following joke.

103
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.720
"Demi Lovato wants to be addressed
as 'they.' like the Divine Otelma.'"

104
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.320
I tell myself. "This is genius."

105
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.120
You're a genius.

106
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.240
You so deserve the satire award
you received in 2020.

107
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.880
Of course. I could have googled
"non-binary."

108
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.480
but I have won awards. jeez!

109
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.680
Are you crazy?

110
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.200
Of course.

111
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.880
I mean. I could…

112
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.600
I could have checked an online dictionary.

113
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.880
but I have an award on my wall

114
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.040
between a crucifix
and a naked poster of Tom Hardy.

115
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.080
Do you get me?

116
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.760
In the end. I write this joke.

117
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.960
"Demi Lovato says
she wants to be addressed

118
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.720
as 'they.' like the Divine Otelma."

119
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.200
I post it on Facebook.
and people are like.

120
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.640
"You're awesome." "Genius."

121
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.600
So. with such solid backing.

122
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.040
I post the joke on Twitter.

123
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200
Yes. my friend.

124
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.480
I posted it on Twitter.

125
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.080
And after. I did something
incredibly smart.

126
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.920
I turned my phone off.

127
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.160
And I went out.

128
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.520
I enjoyed real life.

129
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.520
I thought. "The sun is out.
The kids are playing."

130
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.080
"There's that old lady
with her gorgonzola."

131
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.760
"The world is wonderful."

132
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.480
I catch my train.

133
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.480
I turn the phone back on…

134
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.920
A barrage of insults.

135
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.880
Like I was

136
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.280
Britney Spears's dad.

137
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.960
"You deserve to die!

138
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.640
You fucking straight piece of shit"!

139
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.360
By CutePie96.

140
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.200
"Just die. you loser"!

141
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.120
"I'll dance on your straight grave"!

142
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.760
By CakeLover2001.

143
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.560
Some of these people
wrote incredibly heavy stuff

144
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.160
but had super cute profile photos.

145
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.200
In the end. I thought.
"Okay. maybe I put my foot in it."

146
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.760
"Let's just check
the meaning of 'non-binary.'"

147
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.920
So I…

148
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.560
After the fact.

149
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:55.280
And I find out that the term "non-binary"
is something to do with the LGBTQI world

150
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.760
and not. as I thought.
some Scientology-like thing

151
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.880
or a fad diet. like the Dukan.

152
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.160
I went from your fun-loving.
slightly mental Michela

153
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.720
to the serial killer of M.

154
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.520
I unwittingly made a joke
that offended the LGBTQI community

155
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.480
on the eve of the release of a movie
about the LGBTQI community that I was in.

156
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.400
Let's just say I got a call
from the press agency:

157
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.080
"Hello? Is this Giorgia Meloni"?

158
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.560
They wanted to remove me

159
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.080
and digitally replace me
with a less compromised actor.

160
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.280
Kevin Spacey.

161
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360
Who. me?

162
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.240
I've always dreamed of being a cross

163
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.440
between Madonna. Lady Gaga.
and RuPaul riding across a rainbow.

164
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.640
After quite a long three hours. I think.

165
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.680
"Michela. be your usual bright self."

166
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.520
"You wrote so many amazing jokes
in your life…"

167
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.960
"You wrote so many amazing jokes
in your life…"

168
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.800
"You didn't know
that this one would hurt people."

169
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.680
So I delete the joke. And I must say that…

170
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.360
Another barrage of insults.

171
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.760
Like I was Britney Spears' mom!

172
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.800
Deleting the tweet didn't solve anything.

173
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.760
and I pissed everyone off.

174
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.120
This will end up being on my tombstone.

175
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.520
"She pissed everyone off."

176
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.480
Underneath Emily Ratajkowski's photo.

177
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.080
I get messages like.

178
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.400
"Shame on you. Michela.
You coward. You suck."

179
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.800
"You bowed to the culture
of the politically correct."

180
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.680
What would satire say?
And Aristophane? And Lenny Bruce?

181
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.000
How do I know? Lenny Bruce is dead.

182
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.200
"Hello. Michela? Hi."

183
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.880
"Fancy doing a Live on Insta
with Alessandro Zan.

184
00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.840
the guy you hate.

185
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.400
about his bill against
homo-and trans-phobia?"

186
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.440
I'm not Pillon.

187
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.160
Fine. I wrote a joke.

188
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.800
I didn't only put up an Insta post
supporting the Zan bill.

189
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.920
No!

190
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.640
I did a lot more than that!

191
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.080
I posted a video
with "Zan" written on both my hands.

192
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.200
A double Zan!

193
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.240
Oh!

194
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.240
Could I be more supportive?

195
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.760
But that's not all. Then they said.

196
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.440
"Don't you worry. Michela."

197
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.920
"We'll always support freedom of speech."

198
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.920
Signed.

199
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.520
L'Europa con Salvini party.

200
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:41.480
It was like that time I read the comment.
"Michela. you rock."

201
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.280
written by my ex's new girlfriend.

202
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.880
He cheated on me with her
while I had COVID.

203
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.320
People still stop me in the street to ask.

204
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.880
"Michela. remember
when you went right-wing?"

205
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.360
I am living proof of Andy Warhol's saying.

206
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.080
But it was fun
to be a fascist for 15 minutes.

207
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.120
Black does slim you down.

208
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.000
However…

209
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.160
I did find out something else too.

210
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.480
I found out that being defended
was worse than being attacked.

211
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.800
It's like getting a bukkake

212
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.400
as you're having lunch with your parents.

213
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.280
It's a cool thing. but at the wrong time.

214
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.720
Being at the center of a Twitter shitstorm
is quite the constipating experience.

215
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.160
It's like being on a FlixBus
with no brakes

216
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.320
with a reggaeton-loving driver.

217
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.560
And you're forced to sit there
and listen to. <i>"Loco loco…"</i>

218
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.720
Enough!

219
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.000
How <i>loco</i> can you be?

220
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.280
If you're <i>loco.</i>
you're clearly out there already.

221
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.480
But no. being<i> loco</i> just once isn't enough.

222
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.520
You want to be<i> loco loco.</i>

223
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.520
You want to go beyond <i>loco</i> reiteration.

224
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.360
What could you do that is so <i>loco?</i>

225
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.720
Will you help grandma with her digital ID?
Pay your taxes?

226
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.080
Go to the residents association meeting
without a weapon?

227
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.840
What?

228
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.800
You go!

229
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.200
However…

230
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.600
However…

231
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.160
I've got to say.

232
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.720
fame does have its positives.

233
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.840
You see.

234
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.400
you get free stuff such as…

235
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.320
T-shirts. moisturizers. slimming teas…

236
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.840
Not that I need those.

237
00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:02.000
You get invited to be a guest on TV shows

238
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.320
with very flattering emails.

239
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.680
I remember I once got this email.
"Hi. Michela."

240
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.440
"We are totally in love with your work."

241
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.600
"We adore you. You're such a role model."

242
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.040
"We'd like to have you discuss
something you care about."

243
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.960
"We'd like you to come on the show
to talk about the fact

244
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.680
that. even though you're not stick-thin.

245
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.920
you keep living your life
and doing your thing."

246
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.400
When I read this email. in my head.

247
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.440
I heard it spoken out loud
with the sender's local accent.

248
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.680
this show's writer…

249
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.120
I love her accent
and the city she comes from…

250
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.480
"Hi. Michela!"

251
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.160
"You're the top!"

252
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.920
"Would you like to come on our show

253
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.120
and talk about how.
even though you're a ball of lard.

254
00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.000
you refuse to shoot yourself
in the head like Kurt Cobain?"

255
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.120
"Wow! Top!"

256
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.800
"Listen.

257
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.240
hey.

258
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.840
not to worry. if you come on our show.

259
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.000
we have a buffet."

260
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.080
"And it's free.
with all the stuff you eat down in Rome."

261
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.760
"All the carbs."

262
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.400
"Just to be sure we're on the same page.

263
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.840
here's the photo
of a colleague of yours. Bombolo!"

264
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.160
You see.

265
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.360
I don't hold grudges.

266
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.760
so I emailed back.
"Thanks. dear Maria Grazia."

267
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.440
"I'd be delighted to come on your show

268
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.560
to talk openly about my struggle.

269
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.960
my dress size."

270
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.160
"But you see. despite of this disability.

271
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.320
I do so many other things."

272
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.720
"I get out of the house
without feeling shame."

273
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.520
"Every now and then.

274
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.480
I even wear T-shirts

275
00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.800
with short sleeves."

276
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.320
"And I can fit through the door."

277
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.280
"Sure. occasionally.
I might have obstructed

278
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.200
the Suez Canal inadvertently."

279
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.400
"But there's one thing."

280
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.960
"When I'm at home alone at night.

281
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.600
I do a little dance.
and thanks to my rubbing thighs.

282
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.280
I can turn on the fireplace."

283
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.800
"Yippee-yi-yay. Maria Grazia."

284
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.200
"Top! We love your fire trick."

285
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.000
"Come on <i>Italia's Got Talent!"</i>

286
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.480
"No. thank you."

287
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.360
"I'll go back to my friends.
the cast of <i>My 600-lb Life."</i>

288
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.720
I do thank her though.

289
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.200
She described me as "not stick-thin"

290
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.800
rather than using a term that I hate.

291
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.720
which is "curvy."

292
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.280
I imagine it's pronounced like this.

293
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.480
"Curvy."

294
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.200
"Curvy."

295
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.120
"Lock your fridges."

296
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.280
"The curvies are coming."

297
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.120
Curvy is to fashion

298
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.320
what the last season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>
is to TV series.

299
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.440
The term "curvy" represents

300
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.240
everything that fashion
would rather forget. like Crocs

301
00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.880
and the PAs that got beat up
by Naomi Campbell.

302
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.680
Once I went to an outlet.
But I did many good things too.

303
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.880
I remember the sign "curvy" was written
in bright red letters.

304
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.920
flanked by torches.

305
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.400
You could hear a drumroll.

306
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.880
<i>Jurassic Park</i>-style. Jurassic Curvy Park.

307
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.680
It was full of curvy people
who walked around looking at the floor.

308
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.080
And on the other side of the fence.

309
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.000
you could see some stick-thin moms

310
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.120
saying to their perfect offspring.

311
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.400
"Look at them."

312
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.200
"They move in packs."

313
00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.840
And the curvies…

314
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.480
"Mom!"

315
00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.920
"Are all those ladies pregnant?"

316
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.040
"I'm scared!"

317
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.480
"No. my child. they are not pregnant.
They are curvy."

318
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.240
"Look at them."

319
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.200
"Look. they're being fed."

320
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.080
"The staff will lower a goat

321
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.040
and a rider with a humanities degree."

322
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.320
"No! Please"!

323
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.920
"I haven't finished my PhD

324
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.520
about the link
between Manzoni and Zerocalcare"!

325
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.480
"No"!

326
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.160
And then.

327
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.000
these curvy ladies were forced

328
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.840
to go to a sales assistant and say.

329
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.880
"I'm legally obliged to declare
that I am a US size 14."

330
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.360
"Sure. Go that way."

331
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.880
"Where dignity goes to die. yes."

332
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.840
"Yes. where no fashion can help you."

333
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.440
There is a real division. you know?

334
00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.720
It's like the Acheron for hot chicks.

335
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.880
On one side. you have normal women.
stick-thin girls who have rights…

336
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.320
Okay. this is Italy.
Some semblance of rights.

337
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.840
On the other side. curvy girls
are forced to follow rituals

338
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.960
such as going back and forth
from changing room to mirror

339
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.800
while uttering motivation mantras
they don't even believe. such as.

340
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.480
"I like myself anyway."

341
00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.680
"I have a great personality."

342
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.800
"My dream is to play the hot girl's friend

343
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.280
in a TV series."

344
00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.920
"I'm the fat one with a nice face

345
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.840
who geeks out on IT and Marcel Proust."

346
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.840
Curvies never have normal names

347
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.440
like Serena or Luciana. No!

348
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.800
Their names have to somehow
represent their size.

349
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.200
So we have Big Luciana. Big Serena.
Big Maria Vittoria.

350
00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.600
Big Michela. Big Manuela.

351
00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.840
And they have to stand still

352
00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.320
while other characters.
tax fraudsters or killers

353
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.920
but always stick-thin. stop by and say.

354
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.960
"You like food. don't you!"

355
00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.360
The properly stick-thin women
are terrified

356
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.080
they'll end up being curvy
just by eating a slice of pizza.

357
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.320
It's like. pizza…

358
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.720
Just like Minos. Dr. Nowzaradan appears.

359
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.840
"Giulia!"

360
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.560
"You're two chocolate bars away
from the curvy zone."

361
00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.280
"But. Doctor. I am 170 cm for 70 kg."

362
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.400
"How much longer do you hope to live?"

363
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.040
"Do you want to end up
like that non-stick-thin actress

364
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.560
who earns a living by rubbing her thighs
on <i>Italia's Got Talent?"</i>

365
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.680
"I'm gonna prescribe for you
a protein-heavy diet.

366
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.440
with spirulina and lichens

367
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.440
and other green things
from high school books."

368
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.440
This is the curvy world.

369
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.840
Then you have
the body-positivity nightmare.

370
00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.440
You have to like yourself no matter what.

371
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.000
even if you're spherical.

372
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.800
Otherwise. you're stupid.
superficial. a snitch.

373
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.840
and deserve to drink hemlock and die.

374
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.720
I mean.

375
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.280
life is not so black and white.

376
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.000
It doesn't work like that.

377
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.600
You cannot like yourself all of the time.

378
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.600
Sometimes you wake up like Beyoncé.
sometimes like Magalli.

379
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.440
This is the joke that made me famous

380
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.080
in all the gulags worldwide.

381
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.040
And guess who didn't take offense?

382
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.240
Magalli.

383
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.640
He knew it was a favorable comparison.

384
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.760
Let's get rid of this curvy thing.

385
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.760
It's just a label. A lame one too.

386
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.360
Do we all have to conform to a fixed rule?

387
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.920
Let me ask you.

388
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.320
who defined it?

389
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.480
Do you want to define me?

390
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.080
Fine. be brave.

391
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.600
Call me fat.
but don't treat me like an idiot.

392
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.640
Then I am entitled to beat you up.

393
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.760
Seems fair.

394
00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.040
Totally fair. Right?

395
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.920
Yes. lady. Let's beat them all up.

396
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.080
When you finally get rid of this label.

397
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.440
you get a different one.

398
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.000
I don't know. They call you "tough."

399
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.960
Every time a woman achieves something.
she is tough.

400
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.960
Why is it?
What is she. cardboard? A cookie?

401
00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.120
What does a tough woman do?

402
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.520
Does she kick a door without crying?

403
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.600
Can she find the keys in her bag?

404
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.760
Can she go to the toilet alone?

405
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.280
She's a good thing not in a small package?

406
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.080
Every time I read news such as.

407
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.960
"This is Caterina.

408
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.280
a tough girl who went after her dream
of being an entrepreneur."

409
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.640
Then I see the photo
of this poor girl with no surname

410
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.200
sandwiched between the recipe of the day

411
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.400
and Lotty. the cute seal that sings
<i>La Marseillaise </i>by flapping her fins.

412
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.960
Damn competition.

413
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:14.080
To recap. it's not easy
to be a girl in today's world.

414
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.240
Another thing I hear every so often is.

415
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.320
"How did you get this job

416
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.120
even though you're a woman?"

417
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.280
What's with the pity?
Who do you take me for. a beggar?

418
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.640
All right. give me five euros
so I can buy some cotton period pads.

419
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.760
I'm a VAT-registered 34-year-old.

420
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.760
I've earned my right
not to have my bum red and raw.

421
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.720
Don't you think?

422
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.080
I mean…

423
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.680
All right…

424
00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.880
Enough talking about women.

425
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.880
What do women want anyway?
The right to vote?

426
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.560
Hey.

427
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.720
Really. Merlin?

428
00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.800
Aim lower.

429
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.320
Let us discuss a group of people
who have a far tougher life.

430
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.840
A group of people
who live on the fringe of society.

431
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.800
Those who really
don't have any power anymore.

432
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.200
Let's give them their voice back.

433
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.600
White straight men.

434
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.040
The very few ones left.

435
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.640
The very few.

436
00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.400
Where are they?

437
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.880
Are there any here tonight?

438
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.920
Raise your hand.

439
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.760
I'm not Michela Murgia.

440
00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.080
Two hands?

441
00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.360
Are you worth double?

442
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.760
Were you in Chernobyl?

443
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.200
Let's count them.

444
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.920
One. two. three…

445
00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.760
I told you!

446
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.640
Guys.

447
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.320
What happened to you?

448
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.920
Poor little lambs.

449
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.400
You are this big.

450
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.080
You matter so little.

451
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.000
How? You used to rule the world.

452
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.840
You had an empire
on which the sun would never set.

453
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.280
like Charles V.

454
00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.360
Now you're disappearing.

455
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.880
You're like Prussia.

456
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.280
Like dinosaurs.

457
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.200
Like Blockbuster.

458
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.920
Almost extinct.

459
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.200
Exactly. They'll place you
in nature reserves.

460
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.600
Then they'll make a TV series.

461
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.280
<i>The Walking Straight.</i>

462
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.200
Where…

463
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.160
<i>The Walking Straight.</i>

464
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.280
where you approach women like this.

465
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.720
"Listen to my podcast."

466
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.720
"You're quite fuckable. actually."

467
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.200
"Everybody gets so easily offended."

468
00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.760
They'll put you in a reserve
with a little sign.

469
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.040
Straight White Men.

470
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.480
The first one to come forward
will be a brave soul.

471
00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.080
Marco Montemagno.

472
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.320
"I woke up one day

473
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.760
with something huge under the sheets."

474
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.200
"It was my ego."

475
00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.720
"So I came here to experience the thrill
of a new experience.

476
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.160
being wrong."

477
00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.000
But don't worry. guys. This will end.

478
00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.720
They will soon start writing articles
about you.

479
00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.920
"This is Marco. a tough guy."

480
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.040
"He goes to work every day
without catcalling women."

481
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:13.760
Another label I am often slapped with
is "young comedian."

482
00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.120
I'm 34 years old.

483
00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.200
Quite the oxymoron.

484
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.240
There. nothing but crickets.

485
00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.080
But I'm happy I've found fame at 34

486
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.360
because when you're my age.
you're more responsible about money.

487
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.480
You buy painkillers.

488
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.720
supplements.

489
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.320
orthopedic slippers.

490
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.080
I have a hollow foot.

491
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.560
If you become famous at 20.

492
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.960
you blow all your money on Negronis.

493
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.080
I do Negronis with valerian
and anti-inflammatories.

494
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.080
But to be honest.

495
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:53.240
adjusting to life as a famous person
hasn't been easy.

496
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.600
mainly because of my family.

497
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.720
Being born in a middle-class.
military. Catholic family

498
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.920
has many advantages. like sobriety.

499
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.120
Class.

500
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.640
Good taste. Decency.

501
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.320
But there are others.

502
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.680
such as anxiety. panic attacks.
Catholic guilt. impending sense of doom.

503
00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.200
Basically. the Vatican
without my favorite things

504
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.160
such as indulgences. money.

505
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.200
robes you can piss yourself in
without anyone knowing.

506
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.440
And those sci-fi halberds
the Swiss guards carry.

507
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.760
But going back to my family.

508
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.920
the reason I didn't deal well
with my newfound fame is

509
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.560
that there was only one rule.

510
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.920
The fear of God.

511
00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.480
That was our key word.

512
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.000
"Never be happy.

513
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.600
never enjoy the good things you have.
even if you worked your ass off."

514
00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.120
"Otherwise. God will see you
and punish you."

515
00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.920
Yes. He will find us in Balduina.

516
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.400
In Northern Rome. In the '90s.

517
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.960
Picture this…

518
00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.720
Picture God.

519
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.040
The world's CEO says.
"All right. Seraphim."

520
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.200
"Pass me that brown folder.
the one about Earth."

521
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.160
"Let's see."

522
00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.480
"Let's see. the 'Gulf War.'"

523
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.480
"That was bad.
but the West has its needs. Moving on."

524
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.480
"'The State-Mafia Pact.'"

525
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.080
"Not good. but they made
some good TV fiction. Moving on."

526
00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.000
"What?"

527
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.480
"Young Michela Giraud is happy
with her math grade.

528
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.160
and she's celebrating
with a mortadella sandwich?"

529
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.320
"Peter. give me that whip!"

530
00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.120
"I got you. little fatso!"

531
00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.280
"I'll send you a lifetime
of weight-loss herbal teas

532
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.400
and frozen balls of spinach and cheese

533
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.920
that your babysitter will never
defrost properly

534
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.600
as she doesn't give a damn!"

535
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.320
And…

536
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.600
When God wasn't enough.

537
00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.240
my grandmothers brought on the top player.

538
00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.320
the Virgin Mary.

539
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.440
Yes. they blackmailed me
using Virgin Mary statues.

540
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:29.040
They knew their Virgin Mary.
They were Virgin Mary sommeliers.

541
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.040
They'd say.

542
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.840
"All right. Michela."

543
00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.280
"Today you refused to practice
your good posture

544
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.320
by balancing the heaviest dictionary
on your head.

545
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.400
instead wearing a colander."

546
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.480
"It was a sin with a bitter aftertaste."

547
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.280
"It made Our Lady of Civitavecchia cry."

548
00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.960
One day it would be Our Lady of Loreto.
the other. Our Lady of Pompeii.

549
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.920
The more serious my sins.
the more international the statues.

550
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Like Our Lady of Czestochowa

551
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.280
or Our Lady of Lourdes.

552
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.960
It was Virgin Mary Without Borders.

553
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.040
Obviously. the Virgin Mary

554
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.640
expected us to dress a certain way.

555
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.200
We were born
in a middle-class Roman family.

556
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:31.080
So my sister and I would wear
super expensive pinafore dresses.

557
00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.400
velvet blouses.

558
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.840
patent leather flats.

559
00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.560
We weren't little girls.

560
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.760
We were two young insurance brokers.

561
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.160
The Virgin Mary also expected me
to play a sport

562
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.200
consistent with my main passion.

563
00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.520
ham.

564
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.760
I loved ham and playing with other kids.

565
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.400
Well. I didn't really play with them.

566
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.560
I mean.

567
00:32:59.000 --> 00:32:59.960
I'd beat them up.

568
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.200
Since I was a fat and aggressive child.

569
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.200
my parents enrolled me in a course

570
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.720
that would encourage my natural talents.

571
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.960
Ballet.

572
00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.720
Of course.

573
00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.880
Fuckers.

574
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.600
After…

575
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.160
After many months of ballet classes.

576
00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.920
I was still fat and aggressive.
but now I wore a tutu

577
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.240
as I beat them up.

578
00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.720
My parents wanted my sister and me

579
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.160
to do everything together.

580
00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.120
but she's on the autism spectrum.

581
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.600
My sister says whatever comes
into her mind.

582
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.880
She has no filter. No fear.

583
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.720
She tells people to fuck off.
whoever they are.

584
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.160
She does everything we'd like to do.

585
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.680
but only Vittorio Sgarbi does.

586
00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.240
In conclusion.

587
00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.720
it wasn't easy for me
to learn ballet with the local kids

588
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.760
because they were
the exact opposite of us.

589
00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.720
They were thin. perfect. self-confident.

590
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.040
elegant. and super spoiled.

591
00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.040
They were so spoiled
that they would react in disgust

592
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.880
if their mom gave them
an imitation Barbie instead of a real one.

593
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.920
"Maria Vittoria. it's 1994. The government
has uncovered lots of corruption."

594
00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.320
"And Mom bought you this doll."

595
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.360
"But she loves you anyway."

596
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.160
"Be sure of that."

597
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.400
"Mom. there are two things
you can be sure of."

598
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.640
"When I grow up.
I won't pay my taxes either.

599
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:42.160
and I'll lock you in an elderly facility
in the Rieti province."

600
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.520
So…

601
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:55.680
Can you imagine what it was like
for me to grow up with these kids

602
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.560
who have now grown up to become…

603
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.280
They have become…

604
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.240
No. They are…

605
00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.360
They are whores.

606
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.280
They are

607
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.200
whores.

608
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.680
They are

609
00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.960
whores.

610
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.080
Going to ballet classes was tricky for me.

611
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.080
My sister was very determined.

612
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.360
She was the Black Swan.

613
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.280
"I will be a professional dancer"!

614
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.520
And I was

615
00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.040
just rolling around

616
00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.120
like a marble on an inclined table.

617
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.960
I didn't dance.

618
00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.040
I performed physics experiments.

619
00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:54.360
We'd often have to practice
one particular drill.

620
00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.680
which involved going from A to B
doing a specific step.

621
00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.760
I called it "my own personal Hiroshima."

622
00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.800
This is how the other girls would do it.

623
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:28.920
You're awesome!

624
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.680
And this was me.

625
00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.160
My foot is cramping.

626
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.480
This was me.

627
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.880
"Miss. I can't do it"!
And the other girls…

628
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.320
"Kevin. you're what the teacher
would call <i>les incompétents."</i>

629
00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.480
"My Filipino helper Mahala
dances better than you."

630
00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.800
In the changing rooms.
they tried to be nice.

631
00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.560
They could see that
my sister and I were different.

632
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.120
so they'd say things like.

633
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.880
"Are you two handicapped?"

634
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.200
And I'd reply.
"No. I just have chubby arms."

635
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.440
My sister would tell her to fuck off.

636
00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.560
To be fair. if a stranger
tells you something like that.

637
00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.280
you have every right to do that.

638
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.440
My sister has a disability allowance
but she deserves a medal.

639
00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.800
Hashtag.
Italian government. think about it!

640
00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.960
No. scrap that. Keep sending the money.

641
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.920
The point is…

642
00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:17.360
things weren't great.
We weren't born to be dancers.

643
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.600
My sisters and I had as much coordination

644
00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.920
as a cheap catalog-bought kitchen.

645
00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.480
For one reason or another.

646
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.760
our teacher told us to stay in the back.

647
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.680
justifying her decision
by saying that we were tall.

648
00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:37.680
The last row was us two.

649
00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.800
some dust.

650
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.640
the Holy Grail.

651
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.640
Elvis.

652
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.080
Bill Cosby's filmography.

653
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.520
and Paolo Borsellino's notebook.

654
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.760
I had the hunch things weren't going well

655
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.680
after some rather vague comments.

656
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.560
The ballet teacher

657
00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.840
would tell my dad. "Listen. Mr. Giraud.

658
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.680
I don't want to alarm you.

659
00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.200
but your daughters are
the fattest of the class."

660
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.880
"Especially Michela."

661
00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:15.280
"Maybe she could try swimming.

662
00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.800
track-and-field.

663
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.040
Greco-Roman wrestling…

664
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.400
or WWE pro wrestling."

665
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.120
I'm not gonna waste time
talking about this.

666
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.040
I mean. I have my own comedy special.

667
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.760
We're all here together to celebrate me.

668
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.240
I do magazine covers. What do I care?

669
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.960
It's not like I'm still ruminating
and holding a grudge…

670
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.880
But fuck you. Ms. Pina!

671
00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.320
Bravo!

672
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.040
Go fuck yourself.

673
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.040
<i>Joder. maestra Piña.</i>

674
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.360
Fuck you.

675
00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.360
That's right.

676
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.240
All right.

677
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.000
You see.

678
00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.800
I'm terrified of being judged.

679
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.880
By anyone.

680
00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:28.000
I'm especially terrified
of being judged by my mom.

681
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.680
Is she here?

682
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.200
I asked my mom.

683
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.720
"Mom. why don't you come to my show?"

684
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.640
"How long is it? One hour?
Just you? How boring!"

685
00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.920
"Mom. I'm on the cover of<i> Vanity Fair."</i>

686
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.920
"So what?"

687
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.440
"Mom. I auditioned for a TV comedy show."

688
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.120
"It might change my life."

689
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.880
"I got you the application

690
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:10.800
to apply to be a museum guard
for our region in Ariccia."

691
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.760
And my dad.

692
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:17.640
"No. my love! How could she?
Would she have to carry a gun?"

693
00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:23.120
Every time my dad sees me on stage.
he says I'm making a joke of myself.

694
00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:39.840
That's how we were raised in Italy.

695
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.480
On a diet of control and self-esteem.

696
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.040
Let me tell you this.

697
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:48.240
had my mom been the Kardashian matriarch.

698
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.840
they'd never have launched
a lingerie line.

699
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.320
jewelry. or perfumes.

700
00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.880
They would have opened
a plain white knickers store in Molise.

701
00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.520
My mom has this habit.

702
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.080
She keeps controlling me

703
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.280
as if she were God.
Bill Gates. or Zuckerberg.

704
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.320
You see. my mom is afraid of two things.

705
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.560
That I die or that I get pregnant.

706
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.040
When I was a teenager.

707
00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.920
I once was walking
on a quiet street in Rome.

708
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.880
the kind of street where you only see

709
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.880
prostitutes and drug dealers.

710
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.360
I was chatting with a random hot guy

711
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.680
about the tensions in the Middle East.

712
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.280
"I could grate cheese on your pecs."

713
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.160
Ring!

714
00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.920
Ring!

715
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.880
"What time do you get back"?

716
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.880
I froze.

717
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.360
Since then. I became known as
the David Copperfield of erections.

718
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.680
My mom would call me when I was on holiday

719
00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.960
because crime never sleeps.

720
00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:02.880
We used to spend the summer holidays
in a resort in Calabria.

721
00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.920
We'd get there exhausted

722
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.200
because my mom would drive
at a maximum speed of 40 km/h

723
00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.080
and positioned herself
between two trucks "to be safe."

724
00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:19.040
Her driving would create tension

725
00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.280
with the truck drivers

726
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.000
who would throw their prayer cards at us.

727
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.960
They'd take them off the window
and throw them at us.

728
00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.320
My dad would say. "Darling. could you not
go a little faster? You idiot!"

729
00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.600
"Don't argue with him. Alfredo.
He's a friend."

730
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.200
She'd never seen him before.

731
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.960
You see. Italian seaside resorts
are populated by the wealthiest.

732
00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.960
richest Italian kids.

733
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.920
Therefore. the most spoiled.

734
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.240
the biggest jerks.

735
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.760
There was Andrea. 16 years old.
from Benevento.

736
00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:58.320
sporting a Fendi wallet.

737
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.560
Vittoria. the hot chick from Verona.
with hair that goes swoosh.

738
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.480
And there was me.

739
00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.760
Frizzy hair. only one breast.
Braces up and down.

740
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.080
A Picasso painting.

741
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.720
I felt as solid and self-confident

742
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.120
as any other structure
built thanks to Camorra money.

743
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.880
Eventually.

744
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.200
it'd be time for the teen disco night.

745
00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.000
It would start at 10:00 p.m.

746
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.840
I wouldn't find some semblance
of courage until 11:40 p.m.

747
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.720
At some point. I tell myself.

748
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.440
"It's my time."

749
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.200
"It's my life."

750
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.520
"I'll go crazy."

751
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.200
"On the dance floor."

752
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.440
I take my braces off.

753
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.240
I get rid of the sweatshirt
tied around the waist to cover my ass.

754
00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.240
Side note. it was about 100 degrees.

755
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.120
And after years of ballet.

756
00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.360
I sensually descend on the dance floor.

757
00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.640
I see the hottest guy in the group
coming towards me.

758
00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.880
The beefcake from Brianza.

759
00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.080
Seventeen years old. tall. white shirt.

760
00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.920
gelled back hair.

761
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.520
and a Nokia phone
that could take photos. in 2004.

762
00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.520
He was Elon Musk.

763
00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.280
He comes towards me.

764
00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.360
I just can't believe
he's coming to talk to me

765
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.880
and not to Victoria.
the hot chick from Verona.

766
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.080
I just can't.

767
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.360
He gets closer.

768
00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.280
And I…

769
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.240
And he says. "Michela."

770
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.600
And I say. "Yes?"

771
00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.760
"Your mom is here."

772
00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.240
The DJ plays <i>Carmina Burana.</i>

773
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.120
I look up. and I see her.

774
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.800
My mom is wearing a nightgown

775
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.920
and is wielding a slipper

776
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.240
like Nikita Khrushchev
at the UN headquarters in New York.

777
00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.560
"What time are you getting back"?

778
00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.960
The other teen club kids are like…

779
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.280
So I say. "Don't worry."

780
00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:17.640
"I'll just pretend to go home.
then I'll sneak out and come back."

781
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.680
So I go home.

782
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.520
leaving behind
a den of love. life. and drugs.

783
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.360
This is my bio on LinkedIn. by the way.

784
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.920
You see.
I've grown up with crippling anxiety.

785
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.720
I'm always scared that. out of the blue.

786
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.080
my mom could pop out shouting.

787
00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.120
"I was right! You spoke for an hour!"

788
00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.840
"That lady is dying of boredom!"

789
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.120
This is my main fear.

790
00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.600
I wish I didn't care.

791
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.600
In this age of rules and labels.

792
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.800
I wish I could stop caring. says…

793
00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.920
"the young. tough. not stick-thin woman.

794
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.240
who's not classically pretty
but has a nice face.

795
00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.640
is a self-made entrepreneur
who rubs her thighs

796
00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.600
on <i>Italia's Got Talent."</i>

797
00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.160
This is not an easy life.

798
00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:23.720
I wish I had the strength of not caring
about other people's opinions.

799
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.040
I mean. it's 2022.

800
00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:28.200
You see.

801
00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.640
I do not have the strength.

802
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.880
The only one who does
is Cristina. my sister.

803
00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.200
because she has Asperger's syndrome.

804
00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:38.840
I don't know how much you know
about Asperger's.

805
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.200
I didn't know what it was.

806
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.680
So in 2006.
I looked it up on a reliable source.

807
00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.840
Yahoo! Answers.

808
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.880
Giovanna from Pordenone replied.

809
00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.880
"Yes. my cat had it."

810
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.600
"It threw up hairballs for four days

811
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.160
while watching daytime TV.
but he's fine now."

812
00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.040
Actually. Asperger's varies

813
00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.760
from person to person.

814
00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.320
In my sister's case.

815
00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.440
it manifests as having no filter.

816
00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:11.240
She's like a big baby.
She says it like it is.

817
00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:15.720
She's scared of two kinds of people.

818
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.960
Poor people and ugly people.

819
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.000
I know.

820
00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.480
My sister is a right-wing disabled person.

821
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.680
You see.

822
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.000
when she sees poor people.

823
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.040
she imagines the day when my parents
won't be able to care for her.

824
00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:49.880
And when she sees ugly people.
she sees ugly people. That's just it.

825
00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.920
I wish I had a better rationale.

826
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.440
As you can imagine.

827
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.120
growing up with her was a dream

828
00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.960
because my life went from mono to stereo.

829
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.760
I wouldn't be here with you
if it wasn't for her.

830
00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.560
I wouldn't be here
telling you about my own shit

831
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.360
and being paid for it

832
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.560
if it wasn't for her.

833
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.160
I would have grown up

834
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.400
to be a perfectly thin lawyer

835
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.480
with a cheating husband who tells her
he loves her three times a day

836
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.120
and three kids named Gianmaria.

837
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.760
And I'd say.
"Michela Giraud is quite funny."

838
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.640
"She could do with dropping 20 kg."

839
00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.800
"And I'd vote for Brothers of Italy."

840
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.280
This is who I'd be.

841
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.480
This person.

842
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.720
And…

843
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.640
I owe my sister everything.

844
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.360
But you see.

845
00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.120
growing up with her wasn't easy.

846
00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.480
When she wanted to ask someone.
"What do you do?" at a party.

847
00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:48.160
her anxiety turned her question
into something like…

848
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.640
"You."

849
00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:53.880
"You."

850
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.520
"What do you do?"

851
00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.320
"I'm unemployed at the moment."

852
00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.520
"Michela!"

853
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.880
"Why did you take me to a party

854
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.640
full of cheapskates?"

855
00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.640
In true Goldoni-style.

856
00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.640
Very 18th-century theater.

857
00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.200
I was…

858
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.840
I had to say.

859
00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.480
"No. she didn't mean it. really."

860
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.640
"Believe me. she is just a bit nervous."

861
00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.520
Sometimes she'd ask my best friend.

862
00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.560
"Francesco?"

863
00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.080
"Are you coming on the cruise with us?"

864
00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.360
"No. this year I can't."

865
00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.800
"Daddy!"

866
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.680
"Promise me
we'll never become poor like he is!"

867
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.240
This one time.

868
00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:51.320
a friend of mine.
who's not exactly a Greek god.

869
00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.280
knocked on the door.
and my sister went to open it.

870
00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.800
And she did this.

871
00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.360
"Wow. you're really ugly."

872
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.360
She slammed the door in his face.

873
00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.800
But ten minutes later. he was still there.

874
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.720
My sister is very determined.

875
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.240
If she wants something.
she really wants it.

876
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.800
She's like Kim Jong-un.

877
00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.800
You could compare
the atmosphere in North Korea

878
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.960
to the one at my house

879
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.200
whenever we had lunch together.

880
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.480
One year. for Easter.
we went to this holiday farm in Tuscany.

881
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:48.960
I was so proud to have booked
a secluded little spot.

882
00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.480
basically in the fireplace.

883
00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.720
Eventually. we get to dessert.

884
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.800
still unscathed.

885
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.480
The place is so peaceful.

886
00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.680
And then. a child.

887
00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.160
a fucking child.

888
00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.520
stands up

889
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.320
and starts singing like this.

890
00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.080
And the room goes. "Oh!"

891
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.840
This is me.

892
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.280
And my father.

893
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.040
My mom. And my sister…

894
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.080
"I want to sing."

895
00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.520
"No. No. darling. no."

896
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.800
"There's no need to sing. really."

897
00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.840
"You have so many gifts."

898
00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.200
"She's just a child."

899
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:48.520
"You don't need to show her up.
Let her sing."

900
00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.080
And my sister. "All right."

901
00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.160
And the child…

902
00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:02.680
And my sister…

903
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.800
You'd think

904
00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.280
that the room would go…

905
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.560
No!

906
00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.320
People are petrified.

907
00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.240
A lady behind me.

908
00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.240
Her husband.

909
00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:59.040
The roast on their plate.

910
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.160
And then I became a teenager.

911
00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:08.560
As a teenager. I would wake up and say.

912
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.840
"I'm alive."

913
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.880
"Unfortunately."

914
00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.680
My number one enemy was the mirror.

915
00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.880
I'd look at trucks on the road

916
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.200
with a heart filled with hope. not fear.

917
00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:24.760
And…

918
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.560
You see. at that time.

919
00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.880
I used to spend my summers

920
00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.520
in a snobbish place just outside Rome

921
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:42.080
populated by cool. snobby kids
with their little cliques.

922
00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.160
And I would hide in the bushes

923
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.800
like some offshore bank account in Fiji.

924
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.680
My sister. however. would say.

925
00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.000
"Guys!"

926
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.840
"Wanna meet my sister? There she is!"

927
00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.240
"Michela!"

928
00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.640
"Wanna be friends with these guys?"

929
00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.320
"Guys. my sister is super funny!"

930
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.640
"Michela!"

931
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.800
"Did you pee yourself?"

932
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Inside. I was dying.
Rotting like the Tiber.

933
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.560
I'd say. "Sure."

934
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.320
"Hi. guys. it's me. The normal sister."

935
00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:27.800
At 15. I'd fake the self-confidence
of a 30-something-year-old woman

936
00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:31.240
even though I didn't know
I had to remove a tampon's applicator.

937
00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:44.480
It's not easy having a disabled sibling.

938
00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:47.720
It's like when your sibling
is a rock star.

939
00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:51.640
Everyone expects you
to be something special.

940
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:52.880
"All right.

941
00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.480
this one is disabled."

942
00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.280
"What about the other one?"

943
00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.400
When I was 14. my persona was.

944
00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.440
"I never study. I'm a rebel."

945
00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:05.600
"I have a Nirvana sweatshirt.
I'm such a rebel."

946
00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.240
"You failed the math test."

947
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.360
"No"!

948
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.800
Things weren't easy in the '90s.

949
00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:18.000
People didn't really get
what disability was.

950
00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:21.160
The only disabled people they knew
were those in a wheelchair.

951
00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:24.280
If you didn't have that.
they'd question you.

952
00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:27.520
People wouldn't come up
and ask me things like.

953
00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:31.360
"Michela. you're incredibly beautiful.
What's your secret?"

954
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.200
No. they would look at me
and go like this…

955
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.800
"Your sister.

956
00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.440
what's wrong with her?"

957
00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.000
"Does she have it?"

958
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.400
"The disabled parking permit?"

959
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.680
"No. my sister can walk."

960
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.280
"How come?"

961
00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:57.760
"If you have the disabled badge.
you're part of a caste."

962
00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.480
"You can park in the center of Rome."

963
00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.240
"You can get the best seats
at the Olimpico for the derby."

964
00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.480
"You get first row seats
to Måneskin for free."

965
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.120
"It's a golden ticket!"

966
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:11.840
"You're holding a golden ticket.
and you don't know it."

967
00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.880
"Do you get discounts at IKEA?"

968
00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.440
"Assembling furniture
is a struggle for normal people.

969
00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.440
let alone for those like your sister."

970
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.320
"Is it always Black Friday for you?"

971
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.280
"Do you get free cinema tickets?"

972
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.440
"Not that your sister understands movies."

973
00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.040
"No. it doesn't work like that."

974
00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:38.480
"What's wrong with her?
Is she differently-abled?

975
00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:41.920
"I mean. otherwise.
she wouldn't be like this."

976
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.400
"What's wrong with her?
Has she got Down's?"

977
00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.400
"Is she more up or more down?"

978
00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.600
"Sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood."

979
00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:55.440
"What is she. spastic?"

980
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.360
"No."

981
00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.640
-"Is she Bamboleiro?"
-"What's Bamboleiro?"

982
00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.760
"Yes. Bamboleiro!"

983
00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.640
"Like those people who walk funny.
with mangled legs."

984
00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:04.120
"And you sing to them.

985
00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.720
<i>Bamboleiro! Bamboleiro!"</i>

986
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.160
"Maybe it's your parents' fault."

987
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.760
"Are you transgender?"

988
00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.200
"Nothing to do with that."

989
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.560
"Are you curvy?"

990
00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.080
"Are you Jewish?"

991
00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.240
"Are you Romani?"

992
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:32.920
"Nothing to do…"

993
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.320
"But you said your dad was from Naples."

994
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.440
"Listen. don't you dare…"

995
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.960
"Okay. I get it.

996
00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.160
but have you seen a nutritionist?"

997
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.920
"Have you seen an exorcist?"

998
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.400
"Have you sent her
to <i>Italia's Got Talent?"</i>

999
00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:51.520
"You know what?"

1000
00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.040
"I feel for your parents."

1001
00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:57.880
"They had one disabled child.
and they dared to try again."

1002
00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:00.960
"And you came along.
You're not exactly stick-thin."

1003
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.160
"No offense."

1004
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.440
"I just have chubby arms."

1005
00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.960
"Don't be so touchy! What did I say?"

1006
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.600
"Listen.

1007
00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:14.440
I'm gonna confess something."

1008
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.800
"It's such a difficult situation."

1009
00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.440
"My father…

1010
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.440
has high cholesterol."

1011
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:49.600
"Luckily. they gave him
the disabled parking permit."

1012
00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:52.120
"And he had to insist! Unbelievable!"

1013
00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.880
"I'll tell you the truth."

1014
00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.480
"Yes. my sister wears a colander
on her head."

1015
00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.400
When I was a kid.
I never saw her as different.

1016
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.600
but I could see it in other people's eyes.

1017
01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.880
I could see their looks.

1018
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.560
When we went somewhere. they'd move away.

1019
01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.560
And at one point. I started wondering.

1020
01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:16.600
I asked. "Mom.
why are people avoiding us?"

1021
01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.880
"Why don't we get invited to parties?"

1022
01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.600
"Or to dinners?"

1023
01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.640
"Why do they look at us as if we were…

1024
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.440
monsters?"

1025
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.600
And my mom said.

1026
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.400
"Don't worry. my darling."

1027
01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.280
"You see.

1028
01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.760
our head is like a saucepan."

1029
01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.320
"We throw in so much information."

1030
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.880
"But your sister doesn't have a saucepan."

1031
01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.040
"She has a colander."

1032
01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.760
And…

1033
01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.680
since I used to play
with a colander on my head.

1034
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.760
I asked. "Mom. do I have
the same syndrome she has?"

1035
01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.560
"No. you're just curvy."

1036
01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:17.960
Okay.

1037
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:22.960
I'd like to dedicate this show

1038
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:26.960
to my mom. my grandmas. my sister.

1039
01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.880
and to a person who did so much for me

1040
01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.560
and deserves a special mention.

1041
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.840
Fuck you. Ms. Pina!

1042
01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.240
Fuck off!

1043
01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.680
Thank you.

1044
01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.360
Thank you.

1045
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:35.600
