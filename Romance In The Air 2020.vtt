With all the complexity
in the world.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.333
the noise. the pressure.
you have to find peace.

7
00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:27.458
Your source of tranquility.

8
00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:31.500
And that is where Blue
Cosmos Sandals come in.

00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:34.083
Made from
earth-friendly material.

10
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.375
it's a win for your
feet and the earth.

11
00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:38.750
So try on a pair.

12
00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:42.250
The opulent comfort
will surprise you.

13
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.792
Take care of your sole.
and your soul will soar.

14
00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:50.709
Ah. thank you. Eden.

15
00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:53.792
Perhaps we should see
how Mr. Grayson feels?

16
00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:00.291
You don't understand
our product.

17
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.583
I think I do.

18
00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.542
Well I think you don't.

19
00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:07.542
Our customers like
that we're simple

20
00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:09.709
and ecologically responsible.

21
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.667
You have it painted like
it's some luxury bed

22
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.083
for your feet.

23
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.583
Well I thought comfort
would be a key appeal

24
00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:19.542
given the steep price point.

25
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.625
We won't be using this.

26
00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:26.125
Well. is there another angle
you would prefer I try?

27
00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:28.625
That's all.

28
00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.250
Mr. Grayson?

29
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.750
Let me just tell you we have
a interesting team committed

30
00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:33.583
to doing the best
for your company..

[sighing]

33
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.250
I researched. and researched.

34
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:40.208
and ran surveys and everything.

35
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.792
and Grayson is wrong.

36
00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:44.500
His customers are
buying flip flops!

37
00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.750
They want something comfortable
on their feet for cheap!

38
00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:49.458
Well I'm glad you
didn't tell him this.

39
00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:50.792
Why?

40
00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:52.875
Don't we want our
clients to succeed?

41
00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:54.542
We want them to be happy.

42
00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.542
And we want them to
be our clients still.

43
00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:59.500
Did they fire us?

44
00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:00.792
No.

45
00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:03.458
No I convinced them to stay
and to give us a second chance.

46
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.625
Okay. well good.

47
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.291
I'll give them what
they think they want.

48
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.208
I'm giving it to someone else.

00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:11.291
[solemn music]

50
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:12.792
Oh.

51
00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:14.834
Look. Eden. you're bright
and you're hard-working.

52
00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:16.583
But lately. something's off.

53
00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:18.625
You're not connecting
with the clients.

54
00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.166
and it's like you
lost your drive.

55
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.792
You used to knock these
pitches out of the park.

56
00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.458
with a passion to
rival PT Barnum.

57
00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:24.750
Look. I can try harder.

58
00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:27.417
It's not that you
don't work hard enough.

59
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.875
Maybe you need a change.

60
00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:32.959
Are you firing me?

61
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
No. no.
I just...

62
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:38.375
[sighing] I want you
to take a break though.

63
00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:42.834
Take a week or two
off. and recharge.

64
00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:44.834
Figure out what you need.

65
00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:46.417
and then come back fired up.

66
00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:51.834
Okay.

67
00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.500
What am I gonna do?

68
00:02:57.542 --> 00:02:59.291
Enjoy the time off.

69
00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:01.500
Sure. and conveniently
ignore the fact

70
00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:02.875
that my job is on the line.

71
00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.542
He didn't say that. did he?

72
00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:07.166
Michael. when your boss says
he doesn't like your work

73
00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:10.875
and orders you to take time
off. none of that is good.

74
00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.709
You deserve a good vacation.

75
00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.667
Like I'll be able to enjoy it

76
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.750
while I worry about my career.

77
00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:18.208
Take Michael with you.

78
00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.250
You could come with me.

79
00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:22.709
I wish I could.

80
00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:24.542
Things at work are
crazy right now.

81
00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:25.709
Tax season is over.

82
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.542
We've had a huge increase
in filing extensions.

83
00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:28.709
for some reason this year too.

84
00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:30.667
I just can't take
time off right now.

85
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.333
Okay.

86
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.875
Speaking of. I should
get back to the office.

87
00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:35.291
Well make sure you get
home at some point.

88
00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:36.625
I'll call it a night around 10.

89
00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:37.709
I'm sorry.

90
00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:39.000
Thanks for dinner.

91
00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:39.750
Sure.

92
00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:40.709
See you. Michael.

93
00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:41.834
Good night. Kate. bye honey.

94
00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:43.542
Night.

95
00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:44.917
Okay. you should go somewhere.

96
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.667
I can keep an eye
on things here.

97
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.709
you know. grab your
mail and all that.

98
00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:49.500
Right. you're great.

99
00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:50.959
Well what are good
neighbors for?

100
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.834
I don't even know
where I would go.

101
00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:57.500
What about somewhere you
can just clear your head?

102
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.458
There is one place
I can think of.

103
00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:06.959
Hey. are you busy next week?

104
00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:09.792
Other than hair
appointments. no.

105
00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.125
We can get someone else
to pick up the mail.

106
00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:14.458
Okay. where are we going?

107
00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:15.667
[chuckling]

108
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.375
[bright music]

109
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.125
I've never been to
Lake Tahoe before.

110
00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:24.542
You'll love it.

111
00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:48.000
This is your
family's summer home?

112
00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:49.959
Yeah. it was my
grandparents' place

113
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:51.834
and they willed
it to my parents.

114
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.917
We'd spend every
summer here growing up.

115
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.291
I loved it.

116
00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:58.625
My parents renovated it
a couple of years ago.

117
00:04:58.667 --> 00:04:59.625
But no one lives here right now?

118
00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:00.917
Not year-round.

119
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.625
I called my mom and
she said we could come

120
00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:03.750
and dust it off.

121
00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:17.625
Feel free to call me to
dust this place off anytime.

122
00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:18.583
I know.

123
00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:21.000
I barely recognize it.

124
00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:22.959
I don't think I've
been here since

125
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:24.959
before my freshman
year in college.

126
00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:27.375
Wow. has it been that long?

127
00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:29.834
Do your parents come here often?

128
00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:30.959
Not as much as they used to.

129
00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:33.375
I think they rent it
out here and there.

130
00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.458
[sighing]

131
00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:38.458
Hey. who's that?

132
00:05:39.458 --> 00:05:40.625
Uh...

133
00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:43.875
I don't know.

134
00:05:44.917 --> 00:05:46.250
No one else should be here.

135
00:05:52.792 --> 00:05:54.959
Excuse me. can I ask what.

136
00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:56.917
[light music]

137
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.208
Riley?

138
00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:01.583
Eden.

139
00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:04.208
[laughing]

140
00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:06.917
It's great to see you.

141
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Yeah. you too.

142
00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:11.709
I wasn't expecting you here.

143
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.709
I noticed there's a problem

144
00:06:12.792 --> 00:06:13.875
with one of the sprinkler lines

145
00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:15.709
and it wasn't getting
enough water to the area

146
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:16.875
so I thought I'd come over and

147
00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.041
see if I could fix it.

148
00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:20.542
That's nice of you. thanks.

149
00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:22.208
Hi. I'm Kate. Eden's friend.

150
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.625
Hi. Riley.

151
00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:24.834
Oh. yeah.

152
00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.834
Riley's parents own
the cabin next door

153
00:06:26.917 --> 00:06:28.834
so we would see each
other every summer.

154
00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:32.709
So what brings you here?

155
00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:35.875
Well I needed a break.

156
00:06:35.917 --> 00:06:37.834
Kind of a forced vacation.

157
00:06:37.917 --> 00:06:40.291
The cabin was available
so I went for it.

158
00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:42.750
What about you?

159
00:06:42.834 --> 00:06:44.041
You're living here?

160
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.291
Dad got tired of the winters
so he moved to Arizona.

161
00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:50.709
And I took over the cabin
and started a business.

162
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.166
That's great.

163
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.583
What kind of business?

164
00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:54.458
Hot air balloons.

165
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.250
You sell them?

166
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.542
No. no.

167
00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:00.583
I do hot air balloon
rides around here.

168
00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:01.583
Oh.

169
00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:03.125
That's certainly different.

170
00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:04.959
It's a work in progress.

171
00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:08.083
Well. I'll let you get settled.

172
00:07:09.208 --> 00:07:10.834
It was great to see you.

173
00:07:10.917 --> 00:07:11.875
Yeah you too.

174
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.542
It's nice to meet you. Kate.

175
00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:16.125
Sorry about the.

176
00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:17.166
Oh. no. that's fine.

177
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.166
Thank you for doing that.

178
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.583
No problem.

179
00:07:19.625 --> 00:07:21.709
I'll just be a few
more minutes here.

180
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:24.917
Thanks.

181
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.750
Yeah well I'll see you around.

182
00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:28.000
Yeah.

183
00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:28.875
Okay.

184
00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:31.875
Seeya.

185
00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:35.792
We need to get some
groceries tomorrow.

186
00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:36.750
Sounds good.

187
00:07:38.834 --> 00:07:40.125
So Riley seems nice.

188
00:07:40.208 --> 00:07:41.417
Did you see him a lot here?

189
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.333
I did.

190
00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:45.250
I don't even remember
how we became friends.

191
00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:47.125
I think it was convenience.

192
00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:49.208
He was next door when we
came here in the summer

193
00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:51.041
and became my default friend.

194
00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:52.750
Only a friend?

195
00:07:52.834 --> 00:07:54.792
Yeah. why do you ask?

196
00:07:54.834 --> 00:07:56.333
Just a vibe I got.

197
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.917
That was years ago.

198
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.542
He was the reason I looked
forward to coming to Tahoe

199
00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:03.625
in my teenage years.
but that's history.

200
00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:04.667
[phone ringing]

201
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.083
Oh. it's Michael.

202
00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:08.125
Hi.

203
00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:10.041
Hey. did you and Kate
make it all right?

204
00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:10.875
We did.

205
00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:12.333
Hi. Michael.

206
00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:13.667
Hi.

207
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.375
So how is it?

208
00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:16.417
So far so good.

209
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.625
Good!

210
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.166
Hey. I hate to ask you so soon.

211
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.208
but when do you think
you're coming back?

212
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:22.667
Ah. miss me already?

213
00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:24.542
I certainly do.

214
00:08:25.917 --> 00:08:27.166
[light music]

215
00:08:47.709 --> 00:08:48.875
Morning. Spencer.

216
00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:50.208
Hey.

217
00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:52.208
Yeah the valves on
this are good to go.

218
00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:54.000
Minor adjustments
but it's solid.

219
00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:55.208
Good. good. thanks.

220
00:08:56.375 --> 00:08:58.291
Any new reservations?

221
00:08:58.375 --> 00:08:59.000
No.

222
00:08:59.083 --> 00:09:00.291
No messages. anyway.

223
00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:01.583
All right.

224
00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:04.375
But we do have that one
later this week. so.

225
00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:05.583
Yeah.

226
00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:08.709
Hey. things will get better.

227
00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:09.417
Of course.

228
00:09:22.834 --> 00:09:25.250
[gentle music]

229
00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:49.792
The water is gorgeous.

230
00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:51.083
Isn't it?

231
00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:53.917
Lucky you. coming
here each year.

232
00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:55.083
I'm surprised you stayed away.

233
00:09:55.166 --> 00:09:56.750
It wasn't on purpose.

234
00:09:56.834 --> 00:09:59.667
Just work. life. you know.

235
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.834
How are you feeling about work?

236
00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:02.750
Conflicted.

237
00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:04.291
How so?

238
00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:08.291
Part of me feels.
what's the word?

239
00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:10.917
Annoyed that they're
questioning my work.

240
00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:12.291
And the other part?

241
00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:15.834
I know it wasn't my best work.

242
00:10:17.125 --> 00:10:20.250
Lately. I care. but
I don't enjoy it.

243
00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:24.125
I don't know.
maybe I'm relieved.

244
00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:25.959
I thought you liked it there.

245
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.792
I don't know.

246
00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:31.333
I didn't even really think
about it until Reese benched me.

247
00:10:31.417 --> 00:10:33.291
Well it'll be fine
when you get back.

248
00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:35.792
after you have had
time to recharge.

249
00:10:35.875 --> 00:10:37.166
But it's not my decision.

250
00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:41.125
Reese seemed supportive
about me coming back.

251
00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:44.000
but only if I'm back on my game.

252
00:10:44.083 --> 00:10:44.875
Ooh.

253
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:47.917
It makes me
appreciate what I do.

254
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.125
Someone comes in. you
cut their hair. done.

255
00:10:51.208 --> 00:10:52.291
Yeah. but you're good at it.

256
00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:54.417
And you're good at marketing.

257
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.834
Am I?

258
00:10:55.917 --> 00:10:58.000
It's something that I
chose when I was in college

259
00:10:58.083 --> 00:10:59.291
and I just went with it.

260
00:11:00.542 --> 00:11:02.542
Sometimes I wonder what
else I could have tried.

261
00:11:04.333 --> 00:11:06.333
I don't know. maybe I'm
just overthinking it.

262
00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:08.917
Why can't work just be work?

263
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.041
Well it depends on
what you want from it.

264
00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:14.750
You know. a simple paycheck or
do you want some fulfillment?

265
00:11:14.834 --> 00:11:18.000
That's the real question.
isn't it? [chuckling]

266
00:11:18.041 --> 00:11:19.458
Come on. let's go try the water.

267
00:11:19.542 --> 00:11:20.834
Okay.

268
00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:23.208
[light music]

269
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.333
You don't have to have your life

270
00:11:31.417 --> 00:11:32.417
all figured out right now.

271
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.000
It feels like I
should have something

272
00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:36.041
figured out though. right?

273
00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:37.834
You have Michael.

274
00:11:37.875 --> 00:11:38.834
Yeah.

275
00:11:38.917 --> 00:11:39.667
Of course.

276
00:11:39.709 --> 00:11:41.333
But career is a big part too.

277
00:11:42.375 --> 00:11:44.041
Oh hey. there's this
place you need to see

278
00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:45.166
around the corner.

279
00:11:45.208 --> 00:11:46.834
Mr. Webber's store.
you'll love it.

280
00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:48.667
[door chiming]

281
00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:52.208
This was my favorite
hangout spot in town.

282
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:54.041
I'd always get the milkshake.

283
00:11:54.083 --> 00:11:55.291
That sounds really
good right now.

284
00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:56.041
Yeah.

285
00:11:56.125 --> 00:11:56.875
Hello?

286
00:11:56.959 --> 00:11:57.750
Mr. Webber?

287
00:11:59.417 --> 00:12:02.125
There's a familiar
face. Eden Clark!

288
00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:03.250
That's right.

289
00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:04.500
You're finally back.

290
00:12:04.583 --> 00:12:06.208
Well. just for a little bit.

291
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.208
You know. I haven't seen much
of your family for years.

292
00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:11.417
Not since your grandpa died.

293
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.875
How are your parents?

294
00:12:12.917 --> 00:12:14.542
They're good.

295
00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:17.125
They don't make it out
here much though anymore.

296
00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:18.542
And who's this?

297
00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:19.500
This is Kate.

298
00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:21.291
I'm showing her Tahoe.

299
00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:24.125
and I was just telling her that
this was my favorite place.

300
00:12:24.208 --> 00:12:25.375
Well. thank you.

301
00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:26.875
It's a pleasure
to meet you. Kate.

302
00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:27.792
You too.

303
00:12:28.917 --> 00:12:30.249
Go ahead and order something.

304
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.083
Of course I know what she likes.

305
00:12:32.125 --> 00:12:34.000
Chocolate Brownie milkshake.

306
00:12:34.083 --> 00:12:35.583
That's because of
the homemade brownies

307
00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:36.542
you put in it.

308
00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:37.917
Yeah.

309
00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:39.041
How about you. Kate?

310
00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:42.125
I'll try your
cookie dough shake?

311
00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:43.083
Mmm.

312
00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:45.041
Ah. sensible choice.

313
00:12:46.291 --> 00:12:48.250
Why don't you go ahead and
go in there and have a seat

314
00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:49.083
and I'll bring your order out.

315
00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:49.917
Okay.
Okay.

316
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.750
Thank you.

317
00:12:50.834 --> 00:12:51.792
Thanks.

318
00:12:59.417 --> 00:13:00.500
How much is this one?

319
00:13:00.583 --> 00:13:01.792
This one's 50.

320
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:06.000
Mr. Webber's place was the
hangout for all the kids.

321
00:13:06.083 --> 00:13:08.375
I think he associated
me with my grandparents.

322
00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:10.458
it didn't matter that
I was a summer visitor.

323
00:13:10.542 --> 00:13:13.208
He treated me like a
local. like family.

324
00:13:13.291 --> 00:13:14.417
I like him.

325
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.959
And his cookie dough
wasn't bad either.

326
00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:16.667
I told you.

327
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.500
Hey. is this too much
for the two of us?

328
00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:22.291
Nah. it should be fine.

329
00:13:22.375 --> 00:13:23.959
But you know what we still need?

330
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.959
What?

331
00:13:25.041 --> 00:13:26.166
Onions and peppers.

332
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:26.959
Oh.

333
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.041
Oh. over there.

334
00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:28.625
I'll grab some.

335
00:13:28.709 --> 00:13:29.667
Okay.

336
00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:35.458
[whimsical music]

337
00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:39.208
Finding everything you need?

338
00:13:39.291 --> 00:13:40.834
Mhmm. thanks.

339
00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:43.250
I thought you didn't like salad.

340
00:13:44.208 --> 00:13:46.000
Well. that's when I was 12.

341
00:13:46.083 --> 00:13:47.000
It's not so bad now.

342
00:13:47.083 --> 00:13:48.500
Ah. I see.

343
00:13:48.583 --> 00:13:50.583
You still love bananas?

344
00:13:50.667 --> 00:13:52.166
Allergic now.

345
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.041
No!

346
00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:54.959
Yeah. it was a sad day when
I had to give those up.

347
00:13:55.041 --> 00:13:56.959
Oh. I'm sorry.

348
00:13:58.083 --> 00:13:59.667
So what have you been up to?

349
00:13:59.709 --> 00:14:00.625
Today?

350
00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:02.208
Oh. let's see.

351
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:04.250
I was just fixing up some
stuff around the warehouse.

352
00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:07.291
Leaky pipe. flickering
lights. that sort of thing.

353
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.333
And then this afternoon
was quiet business-wise.

354
00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:14.542
And so here I am
stocking up my kitchen.

355
00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:16.500
I didn't know you were
a fix-it type of guy.

356
00:14:16.583 --> 00:14:20.083
Oh yeah. just call me
Mr. Do-It-Yourself.

357
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:22.500
It helps keep costs down.

358
00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:25.083
You know I was surprised
you're still living here.

359
00:14:25.166 --> 00:14:26.375
I'd have thought when
you were old enough.

360
00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:28.959
you'd leave and
conquer the world.

361
00:14:29.041 --> 00:14:30.375
In all fairness. I did leave

362
00:14:30.458 --> 00:14:32.208
and try a slice of
life somewhere else

363
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:33.875
but then I came back.

364
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.333
Well. I'm happy
to see you again.

365
00:14:39.166 --> 00:14:40.709
How long are you in town?

366
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.208
Ah. a few weeks.

367
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.000
It's a bit fluid.

368
00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:47.750
Right. so you'll relax.
read a book. swim. shop.

369
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.458
That all sounds perfect.

370
00:14:50.542 --> 00:14:51.917
Oh. and hiking!

371
00:14:53.083 --> 00:14:54.041
You know what you have
to do while you're here?

372
00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:55.208
What?

373
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.625
You gotta go to our spot.

374
00:14:56.709 --> 00:14:57.625
Our spot?

375
00:14:57.709 --> 00:14:58.583
The overlook.

376
00:14:59.834 --> 00:15:00.750
Oh.

377
00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:03.166
We should go together.

378
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.041
You can show your friend too.

379
00:15:05.125 --> 00:15:06.583
I'm sure she'd love it.

380
00:15:06.667 --> 00:15:07.583
What do you think?

381
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.625
Let's do it.

382
00:15:14.417 --> 00:15:16.542
So what's so special
about this overlook?

383
00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:19.250
Well. we'd go
there every summer.

384
00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:21.041
It was tradition.

385
00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:22.458
We. you and?

386
00:15:22.542 --> 00:15:24.125
Riley and me.

387
00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:25.250
Oh.

388
00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:27.250
So you'd just hike there?

389
00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:28.959
It's a really pretty hike.

390
00:15:30.667 --> 00:15:32.500
And?

391
00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:33.792
And...

392
00:15:35.083 --> 00:15:36.583
it's where we had
our first kiss.

393
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.041
Wait. what?

394
00:15:48.125 --> 00:15:49.583
We'd hike up here a couple times

395
00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:50.583
each summer you
visited. didn't we?

396
00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:52.250
At least.

397
00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:54.000
The view must really be good.

398
00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:56.625
It depended on how noisy it got

399
00:15:56.709 --> 00:15:58.458
as Eden's mom and
grandma argued.

400
00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:02.542
They always fought about
who would cook each night.

401
00:16:02.625 --> 00:16:04.000
what they would make and how.

402
00:16:04.083 --> 00:16:05.792
Like your mom does
when she visits you?

403
00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:07.000
Don't remind me.

404
00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:09.667
Hey. how much further?

405
00:16:10.542 --> 00:16:12.625
My feet are. well.

406
00:16:12.709 --> 00:16:14.083
I didn't really
bring the best shoes

407
00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:15.542
for off-road activities.

408
00:16:15.625 --> 00:16:16.750
We're almost there.

409
00:16:16.834 --> 00:16:17.667
Okay.

410
00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:23.125
[gentle music]

411
00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:24.875
Eden. Kate. come on!

412
00:16:28.834 --> 00:16:30.250
Oh. wow.

413
00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:31.834
I need to get out more.

414
00:16:33.375 --> 00:16:34.125
How are your feet?

415
00:16:34.166 --> 00:16:35.375
Forgotten.

416
00:16:35.458 --> 00:16:36.417
Worth it?

417
00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:38.625
Just as I remembered.

418
00:16:42.166 --> 00:16:45.125
[uplifting music]

419
00:16:47.375 --> 00:16:49.208
So Kate. what do you do?

420
00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:51.166
I'm a hair stylist.

421
00:16:51.208 --> 00:16:52.041
That sounds fancy.

422
00:16:52.875 --> 00:16:54.125
I cut and style hair.

423
00:16:54.208 --> 00:16:55.500
It's really not.

424
00:16:55.542 --> 00:16:56.750
But hot air balloons
sound amazing.

425
00:16:56.834 --> 00:16:58.000
That's what you do. right?

426
00:16:58.083 --> 00:16:59.375
Yeah.

427
00:16:59.458 --> 00:17:00.625
That must do well here.

428
00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:04.041
I mean. what a great
view of the lake. right?

429
00:17:05.333 --> 00:17:06.500
You'd think.

430
00:17:06.542 --> 00:17:08.125
but it's been a bit
of a slow start.

431
00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:10.333
You know it's a little pricey.

432
00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:12.166
so it's difficult for the casual

433
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.250
or budget-minded tourist.

434
00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:15.458
But it's Tahoe!

435
00:17:15.542 --> 00:17:17.625
People come here to
vacation and burn cash.

436
00:17:17.709 --> 00:17:21.333
Well. people come up
here. hike like we did.

437
00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:22.458
and see the view.

438
00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:24.667
Maybe that's enough.

439
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.750
You don't believe that. do you?

440
00:17:26.834 --> 00:17:28.208
It's a hot air balloon!

441
00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:30.166
It's unique.

442
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.166
Yeah. well.

443
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.709
I can only run tours
early in the morning.

444
00:17:34.792 --> 00:17:36.875
or in the early
evening if I'm lucky.

445
00:17:36.959 --> 00:17:39.583
So I'm starting to think
maybe I should get another job

446
00:17:39.667 --> 00:17:42.333
to live on while I keep
this as a side job.

447
00:17:42.417 --> 00:17:44.667
Well why don't you
add more tours?

448
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.709
Well the temperature affects
how well we can rise.

449
00:17:46.792 --> 00:17:49.875
Then there's the wind. which
picks up throughout the day.

450
00:17:49.917 --> 00:17:50.875
That's tricky.

451
00:17:50.959 --> 00:17:52.375
Yeah.

452
00:17:52.417 --> 00:17:53.709
It is fun though.

453
00:17:53.792 --> 00:17:56.542
You both should come
see it for yourselves.

454
00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:58.208
You mean in the air?

455
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.291
Yeah.

456
00:17:59.375 --> 00:18:00.500
That'd be fun.

457
00:18:11.792 --> 00:18:14.625
Job listing sites
are just scary.

458
00:18:14.709 --> 00:18:17.500
Why are you looking at those?

459
00:18:17.583 --> 00:18:18.875
Just in case.

460
00:18:18.959 --> 00:18:20.792
But you weren't fired.

461
00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:22.125
Look at this one.

462
00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:24.583
This job description
is a full page.

463
00:18:24.667 --> 00:18:25.750
I'm gonna need a special degree

464
00:18:25.792 --> 00:18:27.583
to understand what
they're saying.

465
00:18:27.667 --> 00:18:28.792
Probably not for you then.

466
00:18:28.875 --> 00:18:30.291
What if I get fired?

467
00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:33.417
Then I have to go out there.
find a job. interviewing.

468
00:18:33.458 --> 00:18:34.750
I hate all that.

469
00:18:34.834 --> 00:18:35.583
Okay. I thought
you were supposed

470
00:18:35.667 --> 00:18:37.792
to be decompressing here.

471
00:18:37.875 --> 00:18:40.375
not stressing out
about what-ifs.

472
00:18:40.458 --> 00:18:41.750
It's time to eat anyway.

473
00:18:42.917 --> 00:18:43.834
Well thanks.

474
00:18:43.917 --> 00:18:45.458
This looks good.

475
00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:46.375
Okay.

476
00:18:47.542 --> 00:18:49.542
Here you go.
Thank you.

477
00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:52.333
Okay so what do you
wanna do tomorrow?

478
00:18:52.417 --> 00:18:53.875
What do you want to do?

479
00:18:53.959 --> 00:18:56.333
There's this insanely
over-priced spa.

480
00:18:56.417 --> 00:18:57.542
Maybe a massage?

481
00:18:57.625 --> 00:18:58.709
No thanks.

482
00:18:58.792 --> 00:18:59.458
Why not?

483
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.500
It'd help you relax.

484
00:19:00.583 --> 00:19:01.667
Not really into those.

485
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:02.709
But you should go ahead.

486
00:19:02.792 --> 00:19:04.458
Mmm. nah.

487
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.959
I'll save that for another day.

488
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.959
Oh. what about the
hot air balloon thing?

489
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.583
Riley did text me

490
00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:12.208
about a last minute
tour tomorrow morning.

491
00:19:12.291 --> 00:19:13.458
He said there's room
if we want to go.

492
00:19:13.542 --> 00:19:14.500
Want to?

493
00:19:14.583 --> 00:19:16.333
Yeah. that'd be fun.

494
00:19:16.417 --> 00:19:17.458
Okay.
Cheers.

[fire whooshing]

499
00:19:51.083 --> 00:19:52.542
Looking good.

500
00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:53.667
Yep.

501
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.792
Our group is late though.

502
00:19:54.875 --> 00:19:57.041
Even so. here comes
the important part.

503
00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:00.917
You ready for this?

504
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.667
I am. you?

505
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.709
Ah. a little nervous.

506
00:20:03.792 --> 00:20:05.834
Welcome. good morning.

507
00:20:05.917 --> 00:20:07.333
You guys get up this early

508
00:20:07.417 --> 00:20:08.542
for every one of these tours?

509
00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:10.709
You two ready for this?

510
00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:11.834
I guess so.

511
00:20:11.917 --> 00:20:13.500
Where's the rest of the group?

512
00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:15.792
Good question.

[phone ringing]

514
00:20:17.834 --> 00:20:19.542
Excuse me.

515
00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:20.667
Hello. Hot Air Tahoe?

516
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.542
Hey.

517
00:20:21.625 --> 00:20:22.750
Oh. hey.

518
00:20:22.834 --> 00:20:23.542
I'm Spencer.

519
00:20:23.583 --> 00:20:24.542
I work for Riley.

520
00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:25.542
Hi. Eden.

521
00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:27.208
Kate.

522
00:20:27.291 --> 00:20:30.542
So what sort of fuel do
you get for this to fly?

523
00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:32.333
Like a rocket fuel?

524
00:20:32.417 --> 00:20:34.333
Just propane.

525
00:20:34.417 --> 00:20:35.542
You're kidding.

526
00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:37.041
The stuff we use to grill?

527
00:20:37.083 --> 00:20:39.333
Yeah. the very same.

528
00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:40.834
Who would have thought?

529
00:20:40.917 --> 00:20:42.417
Okay.

530
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.083
Okay. bye now.

531
00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:45.875
Well. some of their
group are sick.

532
00:20:45.917 --> 00:20:47.542
So I rescheduled them
for later in the week.

533
00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:48.917
Oh. come on.

534
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.834
Well. maybe we can
go another time.

535
00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:51.709
Yeah.

536
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.959
Nonsense. we're all set up here.

537
00:20:53.041 --> 00:20:53.875
Let's hop in.

538
00:20:54.709 --> 00:20:56.417
So who flies this?

539
00:20:56.458 --> 00:20:57.250
I do.

540
00:20:57.291 --> 00:20:58.750
You?

541
00:20:58.834 --> 00:21:00.000
Don't you need a license?

542
00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:01.709
I got one.

543
00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:07.291
[eneretic music]

544
00:21:16.667 --> 00:21:18.750
You gonna open your eyes at all?

545
00:21:18.834 --> 00:21:20.917
How far off the ground are we?

546
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.583
Why don't you take
a look for yourself?

547
00:21:22.667 --> 00:21:23.709
Just give me a number.

548
00:21:24.709 --> 00:21:25.417

550
00:21:26.959 --> 00:21:29.500
More like yards but
it's not that high.

551
00:21:30.667 --> 00:21:32.917
[gasping]

552
00:21:36.667 --> 00:21:38.250
You two okay?

553
00:21:38.333 --> 00:21:39.041
Sure.

554
00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:40.542
Speak for yourself.

555
00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:44.458
Just relax and enjoy the view.

556
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.333
Is it safe up here?

557
00:21:46.417 --> 00:21:47.875
As long as I do what
I'm supposed to.

558
00:21:47.959 --> 00:21:48.792
Are you?

559
00:21:48.834 --> 00:21:50.625
I haven't crashed anything yet.

560
00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:51.500
What about the wind?

561
00:21:51.583 --> 00:21:52.542
You said that the wind...

562
00:21:52.625 --> 00:21:53.750
Okay. okay.

563
00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:54.625
Are you trying to
make me more nervous?

564
00:21:54.667 --> 00:21:55.959
I'm just curious.

565
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.458
I checked the expected
weather conditions

566
00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.542
and we're fine.

567
00:21:58.625 --> 00:21:59.333
Expected?

568
00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:07.333
Look how high we are!

569
00:22:08.667 --> 00:22:09.750
Yeah. it's great!

570
00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:12.208
You weren't kidding.

571
00:22:13.709 --> 00:22:15.792
Wait till you see the lake.

572
00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:17.083
Are you. like.
steering us over there?

573
00:22:17.166 --> 00:22:18.834
I'm doing my best. yeah.

574
00:22:24.917 --> 00:22:26.166
You really know how to fly this.

575
00:22:26.583 --> 00:22:27.792
Yeah. let's hope so.

576
00:22:29.625 --> 00:22:30.834
I got my pilot's license.

577
00:22:30.875 --> 00:22:32.667
I was flying regional
commuter jets.

578
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:33.875
Really?

579
00:22:33.959 --> 00:22:35.792
You're surprised?

580
00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:37.667
Well you always said
you wanted to fly.

581
00:22:37.709 --> 00:22:39.458
but we were kids.

582
00:22:39.542 --> 00:22:40.667
Things change.

583
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.583
That's true.

584
00:22:42.917 --> 00:22:44.041
It got to the point where I

585
00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:47.166
never really felt like
anywhere was home.

586
00:22:47.208 --> 00:22:49.583
I was always in the air
and detached from mylife.

587
00:22:50.792 --> 00:22:52.041
I've been happiest here.

588
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.458
What do you think?

589
00:22:59.083 --> 00:23:01.667
All those years coming here.

590
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.208
I've never seen it like this.

591
00:23:05.125 --> 00:23:07.667
I have fond memories of
this place. but this.

592
00:23:09.208 --> 00:23:10.250
this is the best.

593
00:23:11.959 --> 00:23:13.875
Well then you're
gonna love this.

594
00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:14.959
Hey Kate. hang on.

595
00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:15.959
What?

596
00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:17.417
Are we falling?

597
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.417
Oh wow.

598
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.625
And this is the less impressive
side of my little company.

599
00:23:35.583 --> 00:23:36.709
Here. I can help...

600
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.125
Just set them down over there.

601
00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:39.959
How long have you
been in business?

602
00:23:40.041 --> 00:23:40.917
Almost a year.

603
00:23:42.083 --> 00:23:43.834
What's your favorite
part about it?

604
00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:50.083
Floating in the balloon. just
above the lake's surface.

605
00:23:50.166 --> 00:23:53.125
I don't think there's
anything more peaceful.

606
00:23:53.208 --> 00:23:54.125
It's pure serenity.

607
00:23:55.625 --> 00:23:57.166
What's the worst part about it?

608
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.917
Making a living at it.

609
00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:02.959
I'll feel better
once it takes off.

610
00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:03.875
No pun intended.

611
00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:07.166
You know. I could
help with that.

612
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.250
With what?

613
00:24:08.291 --> 00:24:09.667
I work in marketing.

614
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.959
And it sounds like you
need more customers.

615
00:24:12.041 --> 00:24:14.250
This experience is amazing.

616
00:24:14.291 --> 00:24:17.542
It should nearly sell itself
if enough people try it out.

617
00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:18.875
But you're here on vacation.

618
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.875
I could use an opportunity
to sharpen up my skills.

619
00:24:24.959 --> 00:24:27.291
People can't even
tell you're here.

620
00:24:27.333 --> 00:24:29.458
Most people just call. so
I give them directions.

621
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.125
But you're on Main street
and there's lots of traffic.

622
00:24:32.208 --> 00:24:34.834
This building can
be an advertisement.

623
00:24:34.917 --> 00:24:36.000
Sounds expensive.

624
00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:37.458
We don't have to
do anything crazy.

625
00:24:38.083 --> 00:24:39.709
but this place can work for you.

626
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.542
I still don't know if
it'll make a difference.

627
00:24:42.625 --> 00:24:44.917
What have you done
advertising-wise?

628
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.792
You know. a poster here
and there around town.

629
00:24:46.875 --> 00:24:48.625
And I have a website too.

630
00:24:48.667 --> 00:24:49.583
We can do more.

631
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.125
If you'll let me help.

632
00:24:53.166 --> 00:24:55.041
You sure you want
to get into this?

633
00:24:55.125 --> 00:24:56.333
I want to help you.

634
00:24:57.333 --> 00:24:58.792
All right.

635
00:24:58.875 --> 00:24:59.709
Sure.

636
00:25:10.291 --> 00:25:13.000
So much for relaxing.

637
00:25:13.083 --> 00:25:14.875
It almost pains me though.

638
00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:16.166
I can see he can do more

639
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.208
and make his business succeed.

640
00:25:18.291 --> 00:25:20.208
How can I ignore that?

641
00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:21.500
I guess you really
do like marketing.

642
00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:24.166
I just want him to succeed.

643
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.834
Okay so how do you plan to help?

644
00:25:26.875 --> 00:25:29.166
Well. for starters

645
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:30.834
he could use some more photos

646
00:25:30.917 --> 00:25:32.333
and video on his website.

647
00:25:32.375 --> 00:25:35.041
Especially of that view.
and the balloon launching.

648
00:25:35.125 --> 00:25:37.166
Yes. okay. can you
send that to me?

649
00:25:37.208 --> 00:25:39.792
I bet we can get some
social media buzz going too

650
00:25:39.875 --> 00:25:41.208
with some simple ads.

651
00:25:41.291 --> 00:25:43.125
I know he's nervous
about spending a lot

652
00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:46.333
but I know some easy stuff
that will get the ball rolling.

653
00:25:46.375 --> 00:25:47.250
Yeah that's perfect.

654
00:25:47.333 --> 00:25:48.041
Are you sure?

655
00:25:48.125 --> 00:25:49.667
Yeah. yeah.
Okay.

656
00:25:49.709 --> 00:25:50.834
Hot Air Tahoe.

657
00:25:50.917 --> 00:25:53.750
He definitely needs a
sign for his warehouse.

658
00:25:53.834 --> 00:25:54.959
I don't know just a vibe
with the sun and the sky.

659
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.250
Is that going to
be enough though?

660
00:25:58.917 --> 00:26:00.208
You know how you always see

661
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:02.709
a gazillion tour brochures
when you stay at a hotel?

662
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:03.792
Guests look through those

663
00:26:03.875 --> 00:26:06.000
and plan out activities
for their stay.

664
00:26:06.083 --> 00:26:08.166
We just need to get
them to see Riley's

665
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.250
Hot Air Tahoe.

666
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:21.959
I so owe you.

667
00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:22.959
No you don't.

668
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:24.083
Yes. I do.

669
00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:25.250
This is amazing.

670
00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:26.667
I'm glad you like it.

671
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.083
You can still make changes.

672
00:26:28.166 --> 00:26:30.041
I didn't want to
put in a big order

673
00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:31.166
until you saw it in real life.

674
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.792
It's perfect.

675
00:26:32.917 --> 00:26:33.750
Let's print it.

676
00:26:33.834 --> 00:26:35.291
Great!

677
00:26:35.375 --> 00:26:37.750
And then let me take
you out to dinner.

678
00:26:37.834 --> 00:26:38.333
Riley. you...

679
00:26:38.417 --> 00:26:39.709
No. I'm serious.

680
00:26:39.792 --> 00:26:43.291
A 'thank-you dinner'
is the least I can do.

681
00:26:44.208 --> 00:26:45.041
Thank you.

682
00:26:46.875 --> 00:26:50.750
So you never told me why you
were taking a break from work.

683
00:26:50.792 --> 00:26:51.750
Oh.

684
00:26:51.792 --> 00:26:52.750
That.

685
00:26:52.792 --> 00:26:54.375
Unless you don't want
to talk about it.

686
00:26:54.458 --> 00:26:55.250
Oh.

687
00:26:55.333 --> 00:26:56.709
No. it's not
horrible or anything.

688
00:26:56.792 --> 00:27:00.250
but my boss told me
to take some time off

689
00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:03.375
so I can come back and
be better at my job.

690
00:27:03.458 --> 00:27:04.166
Ouch.

691
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:05.291
Sorry you asked?

692
00:27:06.709 --> 00:27:09.333
From what I've seen.
you're great at your job.

693
00:27:09.417 --> 00:27:10.458
I used to be.

694
00:27:11.333 --> 00:27:12.875
I think that this was easier

695
00:27:12.959 --> 00:27:15.917
because the stakes
were. more important.

696
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.291
than say. selling sandals.

697
00:27:18.375 --> 00:27:20.250
Well hot air balloons are
a lot cooler than sandals.

698
00:27:20.333 --> 00:27:21.333
so I get it.

699
00:27:23.417 --> 00:27:25.041
Do you like marketing?

700
00:27:25.125 --> 00:27:26.166
I thought I did.

701
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.542
You told me that flying airplanes
lost its appeal for you.

702
00:27:32.834 --> 00:27:34.166
I guess we all change.

703
00:27:35.166 --> 00:27:36.291
Maybe.

704
00:27:36.375 --> 00:27:37.166
You haven't changed as much

705
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:38.667
as I would have thought.

706
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:39.583
No?

707
00:27:39.667 --> 00:27:40.875
No.

708
00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:43.291
I still see the
same girl next door.

709
00:27:43.375 --> 00:27:45.792
The same girl who would
steal my shoes off the porch

710
00:27:45.834 --> 00:27:46.917
if I left them out.

711
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.917
That's because you'd
stuff snails in mine.

712
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.125
You were always a
bit mischievous.

713
00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:53.417
And you always got me back.

714
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.000
I couldn't let you win.

715
00:27:55.083 --> 00:27:55.917
No. of course not.

716
00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.000
I remember my dad was crazy
angry at you for something.

717
00:28:01.083 --> 00:28:02.291
What was it?

718
00:28:02.375 --> 00:28:04.792
You burned his entire
collection of baseball cards!

719
00:28:04.875 --> 00:28:06.291
I thought they were yours!

720
00:28:06.375 --> 00:28:10.208
Besides. you had drawn
on my face with a marker

721
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:11.959
when I was camping
in the backyard.

722
00:28:12.041 --> 00:28:15.542
Yeah. that was pretty
good. [laughing]

723
00:28:16.208 --> 00:28:17.166
You know. I was always scared

724
00:28:17.208 --> 00:28:18.834
that your dad
would come after me

725
00:28:18.917 --> 00:28:20.333
for burning those.

726
00:28:20.375 --> 00:28:22.208
He never did
confront me about it.

727
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.208
Well that's because
I told him I did it.

728
00:28:26.125 --> 00:28:26.959
What?

729
00:28:27.917 --> 00:28:29.166
Why?

730
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:32.000
Well. I didn't want
you to get in trouble.

731
00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:33.417
Plus I was kind of impressed.

732
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.792
You really one-upped me.

733
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.709
I guess I should be grateful.

734
00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:43.750
Do you ever wonder when it was
that we started to grow up?

735
00:28:46.417 --> 00:28:48.375
Maybe when you stopped
coming to Tahoe.

736
00:28:50.583 --> 00:28:51.458
Yeah.

737
00:28:51.542 --> 00:28:52.291
And here you go.

738
00:28:52.375 --> 00:28:53.667
Oh. thank you.

739
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:54.583
Thanks.

740
00:29:00.166 --> 00:29:01.542
Thank you for dinner.

741
00:29:01.625 --> 00:29:03.041
My pleasure.

742
00:29:03.083 --> 00:29:04.166
But I still owe you.

743
00:29:05.917 --> 00:29:06.875
Have you been by Mr. Webber's?

744
00:29:06.917 --> 00:29:08.166
Of course.

745
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.041
You know he still remembers
my favorite milkshake flavor.

746
00:29:11.125 --> 00:29:12.125
Mine too.

747
00:29:12.208 --> 00:29:13.375
Bananas foster.

748
00:29:13.417 --> 00:29:14.333
Oh!

749
00:29:14.417 --> 00:29:15.291
You're allergic.

750
00:29:15.375 --> 00:29:16.750
Yeah.

751
00:29:16.834 --> 00:29:18.041
I keep having to remind him
so he doesn't get offended

752
00:29:18.083 --> 00:29:19.917
when I turn it down.

753
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.250
You wanna go see him?

754
00:29:21.333 --> 00:29:24.250
I'll trade your bananas foster
for my chocolate brownie

755
00:29:24.333 --> 00:29:25.792
if he unknowingly insists.

756
00:29:27.792 --> 00:29:28.542
Deal.

757
00:29:28.625 --> 00:29:29.458
Okay.

758
00:29:31.125 --> 00:29:34.083
You two have made my day.

759
00:29:34.166 --> 00:29:36.250
It's just like old times.

760
00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:38.083
You work too hard.

761
00:29:38.125 --> 00:29:39.417
Don't you have anyone to help?

762
00:29:39.458 --> 00:29:41.417
I got a couple of
kids that come in.

763
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.500
work a shift now and then.

764
00:29:42.583 --> 00:29:45.625
But this is my pride and joy.

765
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.583
And here's your Bananas Foster.

766
00:29:48.667 --> 00:29:51.208
I'm always trying to get Mr.
Webber to take a vacation.

767
00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:53.458
Vacation?

768
00:29:53.542 --> 00:29:55.834
Where would I go that's
better than this?

769
00:29:55.917 --> 00:29:59.041
Seeing you two back
together again.

770
00:29:59.125 --> 00:30:01.166
that's the cherry on top.

771
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:02.457
[door chiming]

772
00:30:02.458 --> 00:30:04.125
Excuse me.

773
00:30:04.166 --> 00:30:05.125
Thanks for the milkshakes.

774
00:30:05.208 --> 00:30:06.250
Sure.

775
00:30:09.834 --> 00:30:10.959
Thanks.

776
00:30:11.041 --> 00:30:13.291
I wouldn't want you to have
an allergic shock here.

777
00:30:13.375 --> 00:30:15.500
Well it's more like
I break out in hives.

778
00:30:15.583 --> 00:30:17.625
but still. not fun.

779
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.917
So. no more bananas.
no more bananas foster.

780
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.166
You're not an airline pilot.

781
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.458
What else has changed?

782
00:30:27.375 --> 00:30:30.041
I'm a terrible
businessman. apparently.

783
00:30:30.125 --> 00:30:32.041
You just need some
marketing tips. that's all.

784
00:30:32.125 --> 00:30:34.166
That's a very nice
way of putting it.

785
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.667
What else has changed?

786
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:37.834
I don't know.

787
00:30:39.166 --> 00:30:40.500
Maybe I'm the same at heart.

788
00:30:42.208 --> 00:30:43.667
HAve you ever been married?

789
00:30:44.834 --> 00:30:46.291
Nope.

790
00:30:46.375 --> 00:30:48.500
I had a girlfriend.
a few. actually. but

791
00:30:49.291 --> 00:30:52.000
one wanted to get married.

792
00:30:52.041 --> 00:30:53.375
And then I realized.

793
00:30:54.709 --> 00:30:56.542
well. I didn't love her. so.

794
00:30:59.458 --> 00:31:00.542
What about you?

795
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.875
Never married.

796
00:31:05.834 --> 00:31:09.000
Do you remember we used to
sneak out to the lake at night?

797
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:09.875
Yeah.

798
00:31:11.041 --> 00:31:12.083
The last night of our trip.

799
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:17.166
Then we'd go to the dock and
lay out and watch the stars.

800
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.959
Talk about.

801
00:31:19.041 --> 00:31:20.250
What we wanted.

802
00:31:20.333 --> 00:31:24.083
And what worried us. anything
that was on our minds.

803
00:31:24.166 --> 00:31:27.207
First day at school
or parents fighting.

804
00:31:27.208 --> 00:31:28.500
Gossipy friends back home.

805
00:31:28.583 --> 00:31:29.291
Yeah.

806
00:31:29.375 --> 00:31:31.417
[both laughing]

807
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.542
I remember on more
than one occasion

808
00:31:33.583 --> 00:31:36.625
you wished you could
stay in Tahoe forever.

809
00:31:37.917 --> 00:31:39.417
Me too.

810
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.792
I miss those talks.

811
00:31:42.542 --> 00:31:43.333
Me too.

812
00:31:45.375 --> 00:31:47.583
[energetic music]

813
00:31:47.667 --> 00:31:48.917
Hey Kate. you ready?

814
00:31:50.166 --> 00:31:51.417
Yes.

815
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.709
Do you want me to
grab you a drink?

816
00:31:52.792 --> 00:31:54.417
Oh I just filled up my
water bottle. I'm good.

817
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.208
Oh hey. how was your
dinner with Riley?

818
00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:57.208
It was good.

819
00:31:57.291 --> 00:31:59.041
Kind of seemed like a date.

820
00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:00.000
No.

821
00:32:00.083 --> 00:32:01.208
No. it's not like that.

822
00:32:01.291 --> 00:32:02.166
Was it ever?

823
00:32:02.667 --> 00:32:04.583
You two seem close.

824
00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:08.749
There were a lot of summers.

825
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:13.083
I mean. sure. we liked each
other but we never dated.

826
00:32:13.625 --> 00:32:15.583
Really it was just
when we were teens.

827
00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.166
and when we were
younger. you know.

828
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:18.667
playing on swing
sets and monkey bars.

829
00:32:19.792 --> 00:32:20.333
Okay.

830
00:32:20.417 --> 00:32:21.333
Just wondering.

831
00:32:21.417 --> 00:32:22.291
[phone chiming]

832
00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:23.166
Oh.

833
00:32:24.166 --> 00:32:25.291
Oh. it's Riley.

834
00:32:25.375 --> 00:32:26.375
Oh. what's he want?

835
00:32:26.458 --> 00:32:28.041
He wants to know what
we're doing today.

836
00:32:29.291 --> 00:32:31.542
Do you want to invite him along?

837
00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:32.291
Sure.

838
00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:33.375
I'll text him back.

839
00:32:38.208 --> 00:32:41.000
[light music]

840
00:32:41.083 --> 00:32:41.917
You know the problem
with living here?

841
00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:43.417
What?

842
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.542
You never take enough time

843
00:32:44.625 --> 00:32:47.375
to appreciate how
great everything is.

844
00:32:47.458 --> 00:32:48.750
True.

845
00:32:48.834 --> 00:32:50.458
It's like me going to
the beach back home.

846
00:32:51.542 --> 00:32:52.417
You never do.

847
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.291
Yep.

848
00:32:53.375 --> 00:32:55.208
Because it's always there.

849
00:32:55.291 --> 00:32:56.667
Well we have to make
sure you appreciate this

850
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.667
while you're here.

851
00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:08.417
[waves lapping]

852
00:33:09.709 --> 00:33:11.792
You got sunblock on your face.

853
00:33:11.834 --> 00:33:12.667
You bet I do.

854
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.083
Oh. you have a smudge of it

855
00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:14.959
on your cheek.

856
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.792
Oh.

857
00:33:15.875 --> 00:33:16.750
[chuckling]

858
00:33:16.834 --> 00:33:19.417
[phone ringing]

859
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:21.959
Should I get that?

860
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.875
No.

861
00:33:24.375 --> 00:33:25.250
I'll be right back.

862
00:33:36.875 --> 00:33:39.667
[phone ringing]

863
00:33:40.709 --> 00:33:41.792
Hey honey.

864
00:33:41.875 --> 00:33:42.583
Hi!

865
00:33:42.667 --> 00:33:43.542
Sorry I missed your call.

866
00:33:43.625 --> 00:33:44.750
I was on the water.

867
00:33:44.834 --> 00:33:45.667
The water. huh?

868
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.208
Are you and Kate having fun?

869
00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:48.542
Yeah. we are.

870
00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:50.458
All play and no work.

871
00:33:51.417 --> 00:33:52.458
Actually.

872
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.125
there's a little bit of work.

873
00:33:55.208 --> 00:33:57.542
I'm helping out a neighbor

874
00:33:57.625 --> 00:33:59.542
with promoting his business.

875
00:34:01.417 --> 00:34:03.417
Can you explain something to me?

876
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.542
I'll do my best.

877
00:34:05.709 --> 00:34:08.000
I grew up in the same
house my whole childhood.

878
00:34:08.083 --> 00:34:11.417
and even now I don't
live far from it. but.

879
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.625
I can't tell you the names
of more than three kids

880
00:34:14.709 --> 00:34:15.750
I knew back then.

881
00:34:15.834 --> 00:34:17.750
So what's your question?

882
00:34:17.834 --> 00:34:20.291
Why are you and Eden so close?

883
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.709
I don't know if we still are.

884
00:34:23.667 --> 00:34:25.583
We were when she was here.

885
00:34:25.667 --> 00:34:26.500
Maybe it's...

886
00:34:27.625 --> 00:34:29.750
There was this one year.

887
00:34:29.834 --> 00:34:33.458
We were maybe 12.
13 at the most.

888
00:34:33.542 --> 00:34:36.125
And for her. coming here
was a summer vacation trip.

889
00:34:36.208 --> 00:34:37.500
something to look forward to.

890
00:34:37.583 --> 00:34:40.709
So she shows up. goes
straight to the beach.

891
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:44.500
stays out all day and
was a lobster by night.

892
00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:47.709
Is that why she lathers
on sunscreen like crazy?

893
00:34:47.792 --> 00:34:50.500
Yeah. her skin burned
until she blistered.

894
00:34:50.583 --> 00:34:51.709
Ooh.

895
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.709
And her mom forbade
her from going outside

896
00:34:53.792 --> 00:34:55.500
for the rest of the week.

897
00:34:55.583 --> 00:34:57.750
And I didn't want
her to be bored. so.

898
00:34:57.792 --> 00:35:01.750
I brought her treats.
ice packs and games.

899
00:35:02.875 --> 00:35:04.417
Milkshakes from Mr. Webber's.

900
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.792
[chuckling]

901
00:35:05.875 --> 00:35:06.959
And I kept her company.

902
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.333
And honestly it was one
of my favorite summers.

903
00:35:13.166 --> 00:35:15.250
Whether that's the reason
we're close or not.

904
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:16.166
I don't know. but.

905
00:35:18.667 --> 00:35:19.959
she was always a good friend.

906
00:35:21.875 --> 00:35:23.542
Well. I've got good news.

907
00:35:23.625 --> 00:35:24.667
Oh yeah?

908
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:25.709
Yeah.

909
00:35:25.792 --> 00:35:26.875
My boss came to me
today and he told me

910
00:35:26.959 --> 00:35:28.875
I'm being recognized
internally at the firm.

911
00:35:28.959 --> 00:35:30.417
That's great!

912
00:35:30.458 --> 00:35:32.125
Recognized how?

913
00:35:32.208 --> 00:35:34.125
Well the annual company
dinner is coming up.

914
00:35:34.208 --> 00:35:35.542
and they always give
out awards and what not.

915
00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:38.500
Well this year. I get one.
along with a nice little bonus.

916
00:35:38.583 --> 00:35:40.667
That's amazing!

917
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:42.291
You so deserve that.

918
00:35:42.333 --> 00:35:43.750
Congratulations.

919
00:35:43.834 --> 00:35:44.834
The dinner is at the
end of next week.

920
00:35:44.917 --> 00:35:46.458
Do you think you can make it?

921
00:35:46.542 --> 00:35:47.959
Of course.

922
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.250
You and Kate will be back
from your trip by then?

923
00:35:49.333 --> 00:35:50.834
I'll make sure we are.

924
00:35:50.917 --> 00:35:52.709
I'm so proud of you.

925
00:35:52.792 --> 00:35:53.542
Thanks.

926
00:35:53.625 --> 00:35:55.250
I miss you.

927
00:35:55.333 --> 00:35:56.208
I miss you too.

928
00:35:57.542 --> 00:35:58.959
All right. have fun at the lake.

929
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.125
I will.

930
00:36:00.166 --> 00:36:00.959
Bye.

931
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.875
Bye.

932
00:36:05.542 --> 00:36:08.166
[light music]

933
00:36:12.959 --> 00:36:13.834
Thanks for inviting me.

934
00:36:13.917 --> 00:36:15.667
I'm glad you could come.

935
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.125
I'll see you tomorrow?

936
00:36:18.166 --> 00:36:20.375
Yeah I'll drop by with the
flyers from the copy shop.

937
00:36:20.458 --> 00:36:20.959
Sounds good.

938
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.125
Okay. bye.

939
00:36:22.166 --> 00:36:22.959
Bye.

940
00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:23.875
Bye.

941
00:36:25.417 --> 00:36:27.750
So Riley's nice.

942
00:36:27.834 --> 00:36:29.333
Yeah.

943
00:36:29.417 --> 00:36:31.291
Is he dating anyone?

944
00:36:31.375 --> 00:36:32.834
Not that he mentioned.

945
00:36:32.917 --> 00:36:34.625
Does he know you're
dating Michael?

946
00:36:37.542 --> 00:36:38.500
Well it doesn't matter.

947
00:36:38.583 --> 00:36:39.834
we're just friends.

948
00:36:39.917 --> 00:36:43.125
So your relationship's
just simple nostalgia?

949
00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:44.041
Mhmm.

950
00:36:46.041 --> 00:36:47.625
What's Michael then?

951
00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:51.458
He's wonderful.

952
00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:53.625
Supportive. grown-up.

953
00:36:54.417 --> 00:36:55.375
Don't you think?

954
00:36:55.458 --> 00:36:57.250
Yeah. yeah. I agree.

955
00:36:59.458 --> 00:37:01.083
Then what's the problem?

956
00:37:02.041 --> 00:37:02.875
Nothing.

957
00:37:04.959 --> 00:37:07.208
Okay. let's just
enjoy the trip here.

958
00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:08.250
Okay.

959
00:37:10.917 --> 00:37:16.083
So your feelings for
Michael aren't changing?

960
00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:17.709
Correct.

961
00:37:17.792 --> 00:37:19.750
And your feelings for Riley?

962
00:37:21.709 --> 00:37:23.667
[chuckling]

963
00:37:29.083 --> 00:37:29.875
Wow.

964
00:37:30.917 --> 00:37:32.417
You're getting really
serious about this. huh?

965
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.542
Yeah. let's hope so.

966
00:37:33.583 --> 00:37:34.959
Okay. here are
addresses of places

967
00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:36.917
where you can leave the flyers.

968
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.709
Mention my name if
they look at you funny.

969
00:37:38.792 --> 00:37:39.959
but I've talked to all of them.

970
00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:41.709
And if you have friends
with businesses.

971
00:37:41.792 --> 00:37:43.583
ask them about putting
one up in a window.

972
00:37:43.667 --> 00:37:45.458
My cousin runs a bakery.

973
00:37:45.542 --> 00:37:46.083
Best donuts.

974
00:37:46.166 --> 00:37:47.083
Right?

975
00:37:47.125 --> 00:37:47.917
Perfect.

976
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.667
So we all have our lists. so.

977
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:51.583
Let's get going.

978
00:37:51.667 --> 00:37:53.083
Okay.

979
00:37:53.125 --> 00:37:54.000
Thank you.

980
00:37:55.542 --> 00:37:57.834
[light energetic music]

981
00:37:57.917 --> 00:37:59.875
Here. this is a good one.

982
00:37:59.959 --> 00:38:00.709
Thanks.

983
00:38:00.792 --> 00:38:01.709
Enjoy.

984
00:38:08.458 --> 00:38:09.583
Thanks for letting
me put this up.

985
00:38:09.667 --> 00:38:10.417
Yeah.
Have a nice day!

986
00:38:10.458 --> 00:38:11.333
You too.

987
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:31.583
Hmm.

988
00:38:41.917 --> 00:38:43.083
[door chiming]

989
00:38:43.166 --> 00:38:44.709
You beat me here.

990
00:38:44.792 --> 00:38:47.041
Well I figured Mr. Webber
would be very supportive.

991
00:38:47.125 --> 00:38:48.333
He says you owe him.

992
00:38:49.125 --> 00:38:50.125
So you finished. then?

993
00:38:50.208 --> 00:38:51.417
Yup. you?

994
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:52.959
Pretty much.

995
00:38:53.041 --> 00:38:53.917
I wonder how long
it's gonna take

996
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.500
for us to see if
this is working?

997
00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:58.041
I do have some online ads
scheduled to start running.

998
00:38:58.125 --> 00:38:59.625
I should probably
check on those stat.

999
00:38:59.667 --> 00:39:00.709
Whoa. calm down.

1000
00:39:00.792 --> 00:39:01.792
It'll be fine.

1001
00:39:01.875 --> 00:39:03.375
I haven't been this anxious

1002
00:39:03.458 --> 00:39:05.834
about an ad campaign's
performance in a long time.

1003
00:39:05.917 --> 00:39:06.917
I doubt that.

1004
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.625
I'm serious.

1005
00:39:08.667 --> 00:39:10.500
I want this to go well for you.

1006
00:39:10.625 --> 00:39:11.667
Well. relax.

1007
00:39:11.709 --> 00:39:13.041
The rest is out of your hands.

1008
00:39:14.792 --> 00:39:15.583
In fact.

1009
00:39:16.834 --> 00:39:20.792
maybe it's time you stop
thinking about work. any work.

1010
00:39:22.041 --> 00:39:23.792
How?

1011
00:39:24.166 --> 00:39:26.792
[serene music]

1012
00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:39.709
Oh. just like old times.

1013
00:39:39.792 --> 00:39:40.625
Yup.

1014
00:39:43.583 --> 00:39:44.417
Mmm.

1015
00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:48.375
I love the sunset over the lake.

1016
00:39:48.458 --> 00:39:50.166
Yeah. don't get
that back home. huh?

1017
00:39:50.208 --> 00:39:51.083
No.

1018
00:39:52.917 --> 00:39:54.750
Sometimes I come
down here by myself.

1019
00:39:54.834 --> 00:39:57.667
But it's not the same.

1020
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.083
It's probably quieter.

1021
00:39:59.166 --> 00:40:01.083
Well. quiet's overrated.

1022
00:40:03.125 --> 00:40:05.125
It never gets this
quiet back home.

1023
00:40:05.208 --> 00:40:07.250
You could always come back here.

1024
00:40:08.792 --> 00:40:09.625
I guess so.

1025
00:40:10.917 --> 00:40:12.291
You should come back
here more often.

1026
00:40:13.208 --> 00:40:14.083
I've missed this.

1027
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:15.834
Me too.

1028
00:40:17.667 --> 00:40:19.959
Do you ever think about the
last time you were here?

1029
00:40:20.041 --> 00:40:22.750
Yeah.

1030
00:40:22.834 --> 00:40:24.583
We went on that gondola.

1031
00:40:24.667 --> 00:40:27.500
Yeah. I remember.

1032
00:40:27.583 --> 00:40:29.125
My stomach didn't like it.

1033
00:40:29.208 --> 00:40:30.959
Yeah I was worried about that

1034
00:40:31.041 --> 00:40:32.083
with the hot air balloon ride.

1035
00:40:32.166 --> 00:40:34.583
I wasn't sure if it
was a heights thing.

1036
00:40:34.667 --> 00:40:37.291
Mmm. it's more of a rocking
back and forth thing.

1037
00:40:37.375 --> 00:40:38.291
Ah.

1038
00:40:39.625 --> 00:40:41.959
And then afterwards.
we went on that hike.

1039
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:43.333
To our favorite spot?

1040
00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:45.750
It was overcast that day

1041
00:40:45.834 --> 00:40:47.875
but I was determined to go.

1042
00:40:50.166 --> 00:40:53.291
I really wanted to see
how you felt about me.

1043
00:40:54.709 --> 00:40:55.333
We kissed.

1044
00:40:57.125 --> 00:41:00.125
I thought about
that for a while.

1045
00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:02.875
Me too.

1046
00:41:04.125 --> 00:41:07.291
And then I went home and
I wrote you a letter.

1047
00:41:08.875 --> 00:41:09.750
You did?

1048
00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:10.917
Yeah.

1049
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.083
Well I never sent it.

1050
00:41:13.792 --> 00:41:14.959
But I thought about you.

1051
00:41:15.875 --> 00:41:17.083
What did the letter say?

1052
00:41:17.166 --> 00:41:18.625
Oh. you know.

1053
00:41:18.667 --> 00:41:19.333
Come on. tell me.

1054
00:41:21.083 --> 00:41:22.917
I wrote that I

1055
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.375
wished that I lived here
and not so far away.

1056
00:41:30.709 --> 00:41:32.125
so that I could see you more.

1057
00:41:34.917 --> 00:41:36.500
And that I missed you.

1058
00:41:40.083 --> 00:41:41.333
I've missed you too.

1059
00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.625
You almost kissed him?

1060
00:41:52.667 --> 00:41:54.500
Does that make me
a horrible person?

1061
00:41:55.667 --> 00:41:56.542
No. of course not.

1062
00:41:56.625 --> 00:41:58.625
But you do need to come clean.

1063
00:41:58.709 --> 00:42:00.667
What? Why?

1064
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.834
Because he deserves to know.

1065
00:42:03.917 --> 00:42:05.834
Do you mean Riley or Michael?

1066
00:42:05.917 --> 00:42:06.792
Both.

1067
00:42:07.917 --> 00:42:10.333
I'm with Michael. and Riley is.

1068
00:42:10.417 --> 00:42:11.250
What?

1069
00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:12.250
What is he?

1070
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:14.375
A nice memory.

1071
00:42:15.917 --> 00:42:17.834
It can't lead anywhere.

1072
00:42:17.917 --> 00:42:18.750
Do you want it to?

1073
00:42:21.041 --> 00:42:22.834
You don't know what you want.

1074
00:42:22.917 --> 00:42:23.959
I didn't say that.

1075
00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:26.959
And that's fine. but
you can't move forward

1076
00:42:27.041 --> 00:42:29.625
unless you let go
of Riley or Michael.

1077
00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.000
I don't have
anything figured out.

1078
00:42:35.083 --> 00:42:37.125
And I'm more confused
than when I got here.

1079
00:42:37.208 --> 00:42:39.583
and I still don't know
what's up with my job. and.

1080
00:42:40.959 --> 00:42:41.667
[sighing] I'm a mess.

1081
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.000
No. you're not.

1082
00:42:44.083 --> 00:42:46.291
But if you don't figure
it out. you will be.

1083
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.208
Hey.

1084
00:42:55.291 --> 00:42:56.709
Oh. hey. Mr. Webber
called for you.

1085
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.208
He did?

1086
00:42:58.291 --> 00:42:59.875
Yeah he said it was an
urgent freezer emergency.

1087
00:42:59.917 --> 00:43:01.208
and he was calling in a favor.

1088
00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:02.208
I've got things
here under control

1089
00:43:02.291 --> 00:43:03.792
if you wanna go and see him.

1090
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:06.583
All right

1091
00:43:10.458 --> 00:43:13.291
[door chiming]

1092
00:43:13.375 --> 00:43:14.417
Hey. Mr. Webber.

1093
00:43:15.417 --> 00:43:16.583
Hi.

1094
00:43:16.667 --> 00:43:19.083
Oh. this ice cream
mix is no good.

1095
00:43:19.166 --> 00:43:20.875
It's more like soup.

1096
00:43:20.917 --> 00:43:22.916
And the freezer won't freeze.

1097
00:43:22.917 --> 00:43:25.250
Okay. when did the freezer quit?

1098
00:43:25.291 --> 00:43:26.834
Well I came in this
morning to try it out.

1099
00:43:26.917 --> 00:43:31.250
and all I got was this
runny. soupy mess.

1100
00:43:31.333 --> 00:43:33.125
Well. let me see
what I can find.

1101
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.041
Well it's drawing power. so

1102
00:43:40.208 --> 00:43:41.250
might be something
with the compressor.

1103
00:43:41.333 --> 00:43:44.041
maybe the wiring somewhere else.

1104
00:43:44.125 --> 00:43:46.625
I hope I don't have to
replace the whole thing.

1105
00:43:46.709 --> 00:43:49.333
I replaced the
stove two years ago.

1106
00:43:49.417 --> 00:43:51.083
I'll do my best.

1107
00:43:51.125 --> 00:43:52.709
Oh no pressure on you. Riley.

1108
00:43:52.792 --> 00:43:54.625
I'm talking to myself.

1109
00:43:54.709 --> 00:43:56.625
I'm just glad you
could come out today.

1110
00:43:57.875 --> 00:43:59.125
Happy to.

1111
00:43:59.208 --> 00:44:01.917
I didn't interrupt your
day too much. did I?

1112
00:44:01.959 --> 00:44:03.917
No. quiet morning.

1113
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.667
Oh. really?

1114
00:44:05.792 --> 00:44:07.125
With all those flyers out there.

1115
00:44:07.166 --> 00:44:08.959
aren't they doing
any good for you?

1116
00:44:09.041 --> 00:44:09.875
Not yet.

1117
00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:13.125
Well. you better
enjoy the quiet times.

1118
00:44:13.166 --> 00:44:14.291
Because later on
it's gonna pick up

1119
00:44:14.375 --> 00:44:16.208
and you're gonna
be wishing for 'em.

1120
00:44:16.291 --> 00:44:17.625
Thanks.

1121
00:44:17.709 --> 00:44:20.291
So have you seen much
of your neighbor lately?

1122
00:44:21.333 --> 00:44:23.875
We've been spending
some time together.

1123
00:44:23.959 --> 00:44:27.291
You oughta take her
on a proper date.

1124
00:44:27.375 --> 00:44:30.792
I mean all I hear is
people hanging out together

1125
00:44:30.875 --> 00:44:34.125
and I don't. never knew
where that saying came from.

1126
00:44:34.208 --> 00:44:37.875
It's like a bunch of
monkeys hanging from a tree.

1127
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.500
Well it's less risky that way.

1128
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.959
Nothing risked. nothing gained.

1129
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.083
I always thought you two suited.

1130
00:44:47.166 --> 00:44:49.208
Well. we never really
took that step.

1131
00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:51.166
Our lives went in
different directions.

1132
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:54.458
And ended up right back here.

1133
00:44:54.542 --> 00:44:55.208
For now.

1134
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:56.291
It's temporary.

1135
00:44:56.375 --> 00:44:57.875
Well.

1136
00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.542
You better get with it.

1137
00:45:03.083 --> 00:45:04.125
You fixed it!

1138
00:45:05.875 --> 00:45:07.000
Is that what is
usually sounds like?

1139
00:45:07.083 --> 00:45:07.834
Yeah.

1140
00:45:07.917 --> 00:45:08.792
Okay then.

1141
00:45:10.542 --> 00:45:11.375
Hey Kate?

1142
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:19.000
Gone for that massage.

1143
00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:20.834
I'll be back in time for dinner.

1144
00:45:20.875 --> 00:45:21.750
Kate.

1145
00:45:25.083 --> 00:45:27.750
[phone chiming]

1146
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.458
[sighing] Reese.

1147
00:45:31.542 --> 00:45:34.166
What do you want on
my forced time off?

1148
00:45:37.458 --> 00:45:38.750
I hope you're
enjoying your break.

1149
00:45:38.834 --> 00:45:41.083
Could use your
perspective on a project

1150
00:45:41.166 --> 00:45:43.041
when you get a moment.

1151
00:45:43.083 --> 00:45:44.750
Looking forward to
having you back.

1152
00:45:52.208 --> 00:45:54.959
[phone ringing]

1153
00:45:56.125 --> 00:45:57.083
Eden. hi.

1154
00:45:57.166 --> 00:45:58.208
Hi.

1155
00:45:58.291 --> 00:46:00.500
Am I interrupting?

1156
00:46:00.583 --> 00:46:01.500
I have a few minutes.

1157
00:46:01.583 --> 00:46:02.542
How are you?

1158
00:46:02.583 --> 00:46:04.583
I'm okay.

1159
00:46:05.834 --> 00:46:06.917
Uh oh.

1160
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.417
I guess it's good.

1161
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.250
Reese just emailed me.

1162
00:46:11.333 --> 00:46:13.083
Sounds like he wants me back.

1163
00:46:13.166 --> 00:46:13.917
Fantastic!

1164
00:46:13.959 --> 00:46:15.083
Yeah.

1165
00:46:15.125 --> 00:46:16.959
So are you coming back sooner?

1166
00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:19.000
I'm trying to decide.

1167
00:46:20.542 --> 00:46:21.500
It's been nice out here.

1168
00:46:21.583 --> 00:46:23.250
Oh. I bet.

1169
00:46:23.333 --> 00:46:24.417
Tahoe sounds like a great place.

1170
00:46:24.458 --> 00:46:27.375
Well. I say take
whatever time you need.

1171
00:46:27.458 --> 00:46:29.917
Oh. but don't forget
about my company dinner.

1172
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.500
Right.

1173
00:46:31.583 --> 00:46:33.083
No problem.

1174
00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:34.333
I'll be back for it.

1175
00:46:34.417 --> 00:46:35.333
Thanks.

1176
00:46:35.417 --> 00:46:36.250
Hey. and great news about Reese.

1177
00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:37.375
I knew it would all work out.

1178
00:46:37.458 --> 00:46:40.125
Yeah. it's good.

1179
00:46:40.208 --> 00:46:41.959
I'll talk to you later.

1180
00:46:42.041 --> 00:46:43.000
Thanks for calling.

1181
00:46:43.083 --> 00:46:43.709
Okay. bye.

1182
00:46:43.792 --> 00:46:44.625
Bye.

1183
00:46:47.583 --> 00:46:48.792
I need to get out.

1184
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.542
[gentle music]

1185
00:47:02.542 --> 00:47:04.834
Huh. when did we get these?

1186
00:47:14.083 --> 00:47:15.959
Thanks for coming with me.

1187
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.875
Happy to.

1188
00:47:18.166 --> 00:47:19.542
I don't know when my
parents got these.

1189
00:47:19.625 --> 00:47:21.291
This wasn't really a
thing when we were kids.

1190
00:47:21.375 --> 00:47:22.917
You're making us sound old.

1191
00:47:23.917 --> 00:47:25.083
I thought it was neat.
and I figured we're here.

1192
00:47:25.166 --> 00:47:26.500
so might as well try it.

1193
00:47:27.375 --> 00:47:29.458
Well. I'm glad you called me.

1194
00:47:29.542 --> 00:47:31.291
I think once you try this
you're gonna get addicted.

1195
00:47:31.333 --> 00:47:33.208
You're never gonna
wanna go home.

1196
00:47:33.291 --> 00:47:37.667
Speaking of home. I got an
email from my boss today.

1197
00:47:37.709 --> 00:47:39.291
And?

1198
00:47:39.375 --> 00:47:44.083
Well. he wanted my
input on some things.

1199
00:47:44.166 --> 00:47:45.417
Isn't that good?

1200
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.375
Yeah. I guess it is good.

1201
00:47:48.458 --> 00:47:50.500
It's good to be missed.

1202
00:47:50.583 --> 00:47:52.709
I'm finding I don't
miss it at all.

1203
00:47:53.625 --> 00:47:55.834
Maybe you should
consider a career change.

1204
00:47:56.208 --> 00:47:58.000
That's too scary.

1205
00:47:58.041 --> 00:47:59.041
I did it.

1206
00:47:59.125 --> 00:47:59.750
So could you.

1207
00:48:01.041 --> 00:48:02.166
You're still flying.

1208
00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:04.166
And you can still market.

1209
00:48:04.208 --> 00:48:06.375
But is that what you wanna do?

1210
00:48:07.625 --> 00:48:10.291
It's not that I
don't like marketing.

1211
00:48:11.375 --> 00:48:13.542
There's a thrill
in it sometimes.

1212
00:48:13.625 --> 00:48:16.000
Like a pride in it.

1213
00:48:16.083 --> 00:48:17.333
How so?

1214
00:48:17.458 --> 00:48:19.417
When I figure the best way

1215
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.542
to make something great.

1216
00:48:21.583 --> 00:48:23.417
Like a puzzle that
I put together.

1217
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.583
You do like marketing.

1218
00:48:26.667 --> 00:48:28.458
I think I'd miss it.

1219
00:48:28.542 --> 00:48:29.375
So what's wrong?

1220
00:48:29.417 --> 00:48:30.917
Is it what you're working on?

1221
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.917
I think it's easier to work
on something you believe in.

1222
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.333
That could be it.

1223
00:48:38.917 --> 00:48:41.625
I don't know. I wish I had
more time to figure it out.

1224
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:45.000
So tell your boss
you're not ready.

1225
00:48:46.542 --> 00:48:49.375
And risk him rethinking
and firing me

1226
00:48:49.458 --> 00:48:52.000
if I'm not even sure?

1227
00:48:52.083 --> 00:48:53.375
So you don't want to
let go of one branch

1228
00:48:53.417 --> 00:48:55.458
without having a
grip on another one.

1229
00:48:55.542 --> 00:48:56.333
Exactly.

1230
00:48:58.667 --> 00:49:03.834
Well the way I see it.
you have three options.

1231
00:49:04.375 --> 00:49:05.083
I do?

1232
00:49:05.125 --> 00:49:06.750
Yeah.

1233
00:49:06.792 --> 00:49:10.583
First one. you go back to
your old. unexciting job.

1234
00:49:11.542 --> 00:49:13.333
Next option please.

1235
00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:18.125
Second. come work for me
as a poorly paid marketer.

1236
00:49:18.208 --> 00:49:19.250
[Eden laughing]

1237
00:49:19.291 --> 00:49:20.792
Hey. I'm all for
you sticking around.

1238
00:49:23.125 --> 00:49:24.375
Can't blame me for trying.

1239
00:49:25.583 --> 00:49:26.583
The third option?

1240
00:49:28.125 --> 00:49:29.500
Do nothing.

1241
00:49:29.583 --> 00:49:31.834
Just take your time.

1242
00:49:31.917 --> 00:49:34.792
You don't have to make a
decision now or even next week.

1243
00:49:35.542 --> 00:49:37.667
I do have to make a
choice eventually.

1244
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:40.250
But when you're ready.

1245
00:49:40.333 --> 00:49:41.457
Maybe after you've even had time

1246
00:49:41.458 --> 00:49:44.083
to discover some new options.

1247
00:49:46.291 --> 00:49:49.291
You know. if this hot air
balloon thing doesn't work.

1248
00:49:49.333 --> 00:49:51.083
you could be a career advisor.

1249
00:49:53.333 --> 00:49:55.333
Let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

1250
00:49:55.417 --> 00:49:56.000
Should we do this?

1251
00:49:56.083 --> 00:49:57.208
Yup.

1252
00:49:57.291 --> 00:49:59.417
[grunting]

1253
00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:04.875
I think I got this.

1254
00:50:05.625 --> 00:50:06.417
Oh.

1255
00:50:08.125 --> 00:50:10.208
Now use your oar to
move yourself around.

1256
00:50:15.625 --> 00:50:16.750
This is cool.

1257
00:50:16.834 --> 00:50:17.542
Right?

1258
00:50:17.625 --> 00:50:18.417
Yeah.

1259
00:50:20.375 --> 00:50:21.667
So what's your secret?

1260
00:50:22.583 --> 00:50:23.750
Trust yourself.

1261
00:50:23.834 --> 00:50:25.458
Oh. gee. thanks.

1262
00:50:26.375 --> 00:50:27.500
And tighten your stomach.

1263
00:50:27.542 --> 00:50:29.792
Supposedly it
helps with balance.

1264
00:50:29.875 --> 00:50:30.667
Okay.

1265
00:50:34.208 --> 00:50:36.625
So let me guess. you
do this every weekend?

1266
00:50:36.709 --> 00:50:37.709
No.

1267
00:50:37.792 --> 00:50:39.166
Every other weekend.

1268
00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:41.458
[chuckling]

1269
00:50:42.792 --> 00:50:45.875
[light guitar music]

1270
00:50:51.417 --> 00:50:52.250
[light guitar music]

1271
00:51:03.875 --> 00:51:04.709
Hey.

1272
00:51:06.375 --> 00:51:07.834
What are you doing out here?

1273
00:51:07.917 --> 00:51:09.291
Nothing.

1274
00:51:09.709 --> 00:51:10.709
Really?

1275
00:51:11.417 --> 00:51:13.500
I'm just thinking.

1276
00:51:13.583 --> 00:51:14.500
About?

1277
00:51:15.792 --> 00:51:18.792
If I tell you. you're
just gonna lecture me.

1278
00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:20.291
I don't do that!

1279
00:51:22.667 --> 00:51:25.291
Okay seriously. I won't
do that. I promise.

1280
00:51:27.834 --> 00:51:29.959
Riley kind of insinuated

1281
00:51:31.291 --> 00:51:32.750
that he wants me to stay here.

1282
00:51:34.166 --> 00:51:35.375
Wow.

1283
00:51:35.458 --> 00:51:36.333
Gutsy.

1284
00:51:37.834 --> 00:51:39.709
Is that even tempting?

1285
00:51:42.917 --> 00:51:43.709
It is.

1286
00:51:45.458 --> 00:51:46.792
It shouldn't be though. right?

1287
00:51:46.875 --> 00:51:50.625
I have a life back home.
and a job. sort of.

1288
00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:54.375
and what he's saying
is a huge change.

1289
00:51:55.458 --> 00:51:57.417
Not just for job and home.

1290
00:51:57.458 --> 00:51:59.542
but relationship-wise too.

1291
00:51:59.625 --> 00:52:01.250
I know.

1292
00:52:01.333 --> 00:52:01.917
It's crazy.

1293
00:52:01.959 --> 00:52:03.625
And Michael is.

1294
00:52:03.709 --> 00:52:06.917
Amazing. supportive. stable?

1295
00:52:06.959 --> 00:52:07.792
Exactly.

1296
00:52:09.667 --> 00:52:11.125
Why would I let that go?

1297
00:52:13.041 --> 00:52:15.542
Riley was talking about
what I should do for work

1298
00:52:15.625 --> 00:52:18.750
and he said I don't
have to make a decision.

1299
00:52:18.834 --> 00:52:21.959
Maybe that's the same for here.

1300
00:52:23.458 --> 00:52:25.625
Maybe I just need
to put this aside

1301
00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:28.333
and enjoy the rest
of my time here.

1302
00:52:29.625 --> 00:52:31.959
It sounds like good advice

1303
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.250
but you still need to be
careful not to hurt one of them.

1304
00:52:36.333 --> 00:52:38.083
Or yourself.

1305
00:52:38.166 --> 00:52:39.000
Okay?

1306
00:52:41.083 --> 00:52:42.000
Okay.

1307
00:52:48.875 --> 00:52:50.792
And the card's expiration date?

1308
00:52:52.458 --> 00:52:55.291
All right. you're all set
for Monday. party of five.

1309
00:52:55.333 --> 00:52:56.291
Yeah. sure thing.

1310
00:52:56.375 --> 00:52:57.583
All right. I'll see you then.

1311
00:52:58.542 --> 00:52:59.959
Party of five?

1312
00:53:00.041 --> 00:53:02.000
The phone had not stopped
ringing all morning.

1313
00:53:02.083 --> 00:53:04.875
We have every single day
booked for the next two weeks.

1314
00:53:04.959 --> 00:53:06.250
Are you serious?

1315
00:53:06.333 --> 00:53:07.625
That's amazing!

1316
00:53:07.709 --> 00:53:10.291
Your friend has really
got things rolling here.

1317
00:53:10.375 --> 00:53:13.041
I'm going to go get things
prepped for tomorrow's tour.

1318
00:53:15.667 --> 00:53:18.667
[phone ringing]

1319
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:20.208
Hot Air Tahoe. can I help you?

1320
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.208
Let me check.

1321
00:53:32.917 --> 00:53:35.500
So. guess how many calls I got?

1322
00:53:35.583 --> 00:53:36.375
How many?

1323
00:53:36.458 --> 00:53:37.291
33.

1324
00:53:38.542 --> 00:53:39.333
No. actually it
was more than that.

1325
00:53:39.375 --> 00:53:41.000
I lost count.

1326
00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:43.500
I haven't had to answer
the phone that often ever.

1327
00:53:43.583 --> 00:53:44.750
But are people booking?

1328
00:53:44.834 --> 00:53:45.458
Yeah!

1329
00:53:45.542 --> 00:53:47.041
That's the crazy thing!

1330
00:53:47.125 --> 00:53:48.917
I'm starting to wonder if
we need to raise prices.

1331
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.792
You probably could.
but maybe wait a bit.

1332
00:53:50.875 --> 00:53:52.875
I don't want this to
be an initial rush

1333
00:53:52.959 --> 00:53:55.709
with no continued
traffic from customers.

1334
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:57.458
Look at you. talking
all business.

1335
00:53:58.917 --> 00:54:01.458
Have you set up
appointment booking online?

1336
00:54:01.542 --> 00:54:04.542
I asked Spencer
to. six months ago.

1337
00:54:04.625 --> 00:54:05.917
It's not going well.

1338
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.583
I'm going to send you a link
for a site that handles that.

1339
00:54:08.667 --> 00:54:10.041
It's very affordable

1340
00:54:10.125 --> 00:54:11.959
and it saves you time so
you don't have to spend

1341
00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:13.375
the day on the phone.

1342
00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:14.583
Excellent.

1343
00:54:14.667 --> 00:54:16.375
So what you working on?

1344
00:54:16.417 --> 00:54:18.375
Web ads.

1345
00:54:18.417 --> 00:54:19.834
What do you think?

1346
00:54:19.917 --> 00:54:20.875
It looks...

1347
00:54:22.083 --> 00:54:22.959
What?

1348
00:54:24.417 --> 00:54:25.250
Legitimate.

1349
00:54:26.041 --> 00:54:27.834
Well. good. because you are.

1350
00:54:27.917 --> 00:54:30.375
I feel professional. and
I'm not even doing the work.

1351
00:54:30.417 --> 00:54:31.542
You are.

1352
00:54:31.583 --> 00:54:32.875
And I'm gonna give you options.

1353
00:54:32.959 --> 00:54:35.375
that way you don't have to
use the same ad all the time.

1354
00:54:35.417 --> 00:54:37.417
What for?

1355
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:40.583
To change it up for seasons.
holidays. stuff like that.

1356
00:54:40.667 --> 00:54:42.041
Got it.

1357
00:54:42.125 --> 00:54:42.917
Okay.

1358
00:54:44.625 --> 00:54:45.709
And there you go.

1359
00:54:47.375 --> 00:54:49.417
I don't know what I'm
going to do without you.

1360
00:54:49.458 --> 00:54:51.417
Oh. I think you'll do fine.

1361
00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:52.709
I'd rather not find out.

1362
00:54:55.083 --> 00:54:56.333
Any chance you'll stay?

1363
00:54:59.583 --> 00:55:02.417
You can get anyone to
help you with this.

1364
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.166
Don't worry. it's not like
your business will lose out.

1365
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:09.917
Well. it's not my business
I'm worried about losing.

1366
00:55:16.375 --> 00:55:18.792
So what are your plans
for the rest of your stay?

1367
00:55:26.083 --> 00:55:27.625
I've got clients
coming out of nowhere.

1368
00:55:27.667 --> 00:55:28.959
trying to get on my schedule.

1369
00:55:29.041 --> 00:55:31.583
I might have to work 10
hours a day when I get back.

1370
00:55:31.667 --> 00:55:32.959
It's good to be
in demand. right?

1371
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.625
I guess.

1372
00:55:34.709 --> 00:55:35.875
I'm still dreading it.

1373
00:55:35.959 --> 00:55:36.834
Me too.

1374
00:55:36.917 --> 00:55:38.458
When's your next appointment?

1375
00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:39.959
Monday.

1376
00:55:40.041 --> 00:55:41.792
Are you going back
to work then too?

1377
00:55:41.834 --> 00:55:43.542
I'm still figuring it out.

1378
00:55:49.709 --> 00:55:50.542
[thoughtful music]

1379
00:55:53.125 --> 00:55:54.792
Yeah just a few more
things to load up

1380
00:55:54.875 --> 00:55:56.125
and should be all set.

1381
00:55:56.208 --> 00:55:57.583
Great.

1382
00:55:57.667 --> 00:55:58.792
Yeah I've got to
get to bed early.

1383
00:55:58.875 --> 00:56:00.083
I've been used to sleeping in.

1384
00:56:00.166 --> 00:56:01.333
Oh yeah?

1385
00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:02.250
Well I'd say I'm
sorry but no sleep

1386
00:56:02.333 --> 00:56:03.667
means work and a paycheck.

1387
00:56:03.709 --> 00:56:04.625
I'll take it.

1388
00:56:05.875 --> 00:56:07.375
Eden mentioned we
should do something

1389
00:56:07.458 --> 00:56:11.000
to encourage customers
to leave reviews.

1390
00:56:11.083 --> 00:56:13.709
Yeah. like a follow-up
email or something?

1391
00:56:13.792 --> 00:56:17.041
Or we could give away a free
t-shirt for every good review?

1392
00:56:18.667 --> 00:56:20.583
I don't think bribery
is the way to go.

1393
00:56:20.667 --> 00:56:22.625
I'll have to ask her
for some ideas on that.

1394
00:56:22.709 --> 00:56:24.041
Well. is she staying?

1395
00:56:24.125 --> 00:56:25.500
I'd like her to. but.

1396
00:56:25.542 --> 00:56:27.458
But what?

1397
00:56:27.542 --> 00:56:29.041
Well. too early to tell.

1398
00:56:30.917 --> 00:56:32.000
Are you two dating?

1399
00:56:33.583 --> 00:56:34.417
Too early to tell.

1400
00:56:35.458 --> 00:56:37.834
Well. sounds like you
have a lot to clear up.

1401
00:56:37.917 --> 00:56:39.500
I'm just gonna
finish loading up.

1402
00:56:39.583 --> 00:56:41.041
All right. thanks. Spencer.

1404
00:56:54.083 --> 00:56:55.834
These are beautiful.

1405
00:56:59.792 --> 00:57:00.542
Here you go.

1406
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:01.625
Great.

1407
00:57:01.709 --> 00:57:02.208
Thank you.

1408
00:57:02.291 --> 00:57:04.041
Thank you.

1409
00:57:12.583 --> 00:57:13.959
This is just about done.

1410
00:57:14.041 --> 00:57:14.834
Great.

1411

[knocking]

1412
00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:21.291
Oh. I'll get it.

1413
00:57:26.458 --> 00:57:27.750
Michael?

1414
00:57:27.834 --> 00:57:28.667
Eden.

1415
00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:35.500
So I was thinking
about your call.

1416
00:57:35.583 --> 00:57:37.000
and seeing you. and about Tahoe

1417
00:57:37.083 --> 00:57:38.458
and it dawned on me.

1418
00:57:38.542 --> 00:57:40.583
why not come for the
weekend at least?

1419
00:57:40.667 --> 00:57:42.125
I'm glad to see you.

1420
00:57:44.625 --> 00:57:45.458

1422
00:57:49.667 --> 00:57:50.875
Oh. hi Kate.

1423
00:57:54.125 --> 00:57:54.959
Riley.

1424
00:57:56.291 --> 00:57:57.458
This is Michael.

1425

1426
00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:00.542
Hi.

1427
00:58:03.625 --> 00:58:05.000
Good to meet you.

1428
00:58:05.083 --> 00:58:06.875
Nice flowers.

1429
00:58:06.959 --> 00:58:11.041
Yeah. they're for Eden.
and Kate. as a thank you

1430
00:58:11.125 --> 00:58:12.625
for their help with my business.

1431
00:58:12.709 --> 00:58:15.125
Oh. you're the neighbor that
Eden's been helping out.

1432
00:58:15.208 --> 00:58:17.959
Uh. I guess so. [chuckling]

1433
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:20.041
You didn't have to do that.

1434
00:58:20.125 --> 00:58:21.166
I know. but...

1435
00:58:24.125 --> 00:58:24.917
Yeah.

1436

Dinner's ready.

1437
00:58:27.792 --> 00:58:28.583
Oh great.

1438
00:58:28.667 --> 00:58:29.542
I'm starving.

1439
00:58:30.667 --> 00:58:31.917
Nice tan!

1440
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:32.917
Thanks.

1441
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:38.166
I just wanted to drop those off.

1442
00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:39.500
Riley. I didn't know.

1443
00:58:39.583 --> 00:58:42.959
The response to the flyers
and everything has been great.

1444
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000
We've been getting
a lot of business.

1445
00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:45.709
So. thank you.

1446

You have company.

1453
00:59:30.709 --> 00:59:31.875
You know. I'll be right back.

1454
00:59:31.959 --> 00:59:32.834
Okay.

1455
00:59:39.166 --> 00:59:40.750
You were right.

1456
00:59:40.834 --> 00:59:41.834
I'm sorry.

1457
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.041
I don't like being right.

1458
00:59:45.125 --> 00:59:47.041
At least not with this.

1459
00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:48.667
Should I tell
Michael about Riley?

1460
00:59:50.959 --> 00:59:53.041
I think you could.

I don't want to hurt him too.

1462
00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:57.417
I think he would understand.

1463
00:59:59.333 --> 01:00:02.000
But it's more urgent
you talk to Riley.

1464
01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:27.125
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about Michael.

1465
01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:28.834
I didn't mean to
keep it from you.

1466
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:36.834
It's your life.

1467
01:00:39.792 --> 01:00:41.291
And we're just old friends.

1468
01:00:41.375 --> 01:00:42.625
You're more than that.

1469
01:00:43.458 --> 01:00:44.625
But not enough.

1470
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.125
That's not true.

1471
01:00:48.792 --> 01:00:49.667
Isn't it?

1472
01:00:51.792 --> 01:00:52.625
But it's okay.

1473
01:00:54.208 --> 01:00:56.083
I've really enjoyed
seeing you again.

1474
01:00:57.083 --> 01:00:57.875
Me too.

1475
01:00:59.875 --> 01:01:00.875
And my business.

1476
01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:03.667
I really got a shot
now. thanks to you.

1477
01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:06.500
Thanks for letting me help.

1478
01:01:08.417 --> 01:01:11.500
And for being my friend.

1479
01:01:24.834 --> 01:01:26.208
Here you go.

1480
01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:27.166
Thank you.

1481
01:01:28.333 --> 01:01:30.208
Better get that to Riley
right away before it melts.

1482
01:01:30.291 --> 01:01:32.291
Oh. it's not for him.

1483
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.750
I'm gonna miss these.

1484
01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:42.000
Are you leaving?

1485
01:01:42.083 --> 01:01:43.291
Yeah.

1486
01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:47.000
It's been wonderful. but
too bad it's just temporary.

1487
01:01:47.083 --> 01:01:48.792
Now wait a minute.

1488
01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:50.166
Not everything is temporary.

1489
01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:52.959
The way you feel here and
now. that'll stay with you.

1490
01:01:54.959 --> 01:01:57.000
[door chiming]

1491
01:01:57.041 --> 01:01:58.417
I should let you go.

1492
01:02:00.625 --> 01:02:02.083
Eden.

1493
01:02:02.166 --> 01:02:05.125
If you go back. what do
you leave behind here now?

1494
01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:10.125
Thanks. Mr. Webber.

1495
01:02:14.166 --> 01:02:17.125
[melancholy music]

1496
01:02:19.875 --> 01:02:21.792
So how are your tax deadlines?

1497
01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:23.792
Ah. chopping away
at them. bit by bit.

1498
01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:26.250
It's nice not to be
in the office though.

1499
01:02:26.333 --> 01:02:28.041
Breath of fresh
air. and all that.

1500
01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:28.959
Yeah.

1501
01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:31.375
Listen. I should
have come sooner.

1502
01:02:31.417 --> 01:02:33.375
You asked me and I
just made excuses.

1503
01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:36.041
Well you're busy.
I understand that.

1504
01:02:36.083 --> 01:02:37.375
Well I was talking to Kate.

1505
01:02:37.417 --> 01:02:38.500
and she helped me
realize how upsetting

1506
01:02:38.583 --> 01:02:40.250
the last couple of
weeks have been for you.

1507
01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:42.917
Well. I wouldn't say
it was upsetting.

1508
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:43.959
Nerve-wracking?

1509
01:02:44.041 --> 01:02:44.834
Either way. I should
have been here.

1510
01:02:44.917 --> 01:02:46.083
[phone chiming]

1511
01:02:46.166 --> 01:02:46.959
Oh.

1512
01:02:49.125 --> 01:02:50.291
What is it?

1513
01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:51.792
Oh. it's Reese.

1514
01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:55.417
He wants to know
if I can make it to

1515
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.875
an all-hands on meeting Tuesday.

1516
01:02:57.917 --> 01:02:59.709
Wow. he really wants you back.

1517
01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.333
Yeah.

1518
01:03:01.417 --> 01:03:03.041
He's seen what life's like
with you out of the office

1519
01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:05.083
and he doesn't like it.

1520
01:03:05.125 --> 01:03:06.417
I'm so glad this worked for you.

1521
01:03:06.458 --> 01:03:07.417
Me too.

1522
01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.083
Is that everything?

1523
01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:16.917
Yep. I double-checked.

1524
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.083
Even under the furniture.

1525
01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:19.208
You're thorough.

1526
01:03:20.792 --> 01:03:21.458
Ready?

1527
01:03:21.542 --> 01:03:23.083
Yeah. I'm just gonna lock up.

1528
01:03:23.125 --> 01:03:24.583
Okay. sounds good.

1529
01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:25.625
Hey.
Hey.

1530
01:03:30.375 --> 01:03:33.875
[light melancholy music]

1531
01:03:43.041 --> 01:03:43.917
Hi.

1532
01:03:43.959 --> 01:03:44.834
Hey.

1533
01:03:49.208 --> 01:03:50.625
We're leaving.

1534
01:03:50.667 --> 01:03:52.083
Work and all that.

1535
01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:53.792
Going back to it. huh?

1536
01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:55.000
Yeah.

1537
01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:56.583
I hope it works out.

1538
01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:57.500
Thanks.

1539
01:03:59.625 --> 01:04:01.291
I should go.

1540
01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:02.333
Hey. if you're in town again.

1541
01:04:02.417 --> 01:04:04.458
you should come by the shop.

1542
01:04:04.542 --> 01:04:06.875
See if we're following
your advice well or not.

1543
01:04:08.625 --> 01:04:09.667
I definitely will.

1544
01:04:13.417 --> 01:04:14.458
Goodbye. Riley.

1545
01:04:16.208 --> 01:04:17.542
Goodbye. Eden.

1546
01:04:34.041 --> 01:04:36.375
Hey. you want me to drive?

1547
01:04:36.458 --> 01:04:37.583
Yeah. sure.

1548
01:04:41.667 --> 01:04:44.291
[car starting]

1549
01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:59.083
[thoughtful guitar music]

1550
01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:23.000
All right. now normally
divide up assignments here.

1551
01:05:23.083 --> 01:05:24.375
and we'll get to that.

1552
01:05:24.417 --> 01:05:26.291
But I want to start
with some news.

1553
01:05:26.375 --> 01:05:27.500
Good news.

1554
01:05:27.583 --> 01:05:30.458
We have two brand new
clients under contract now.

1555
01:05:30.959 --> 01:05:34.208
Castle Vacuums and
MinFloral Air Fresheners.

1556
01:05:34.291 --> 01:05:35.375
[clapping]
Right?

1557
01:05:35.417 --> 01:05:37.542
This is gonna be great for us.

1558
01:05:37.583 --> 01:05:38.375
They're eager to hit
the ground running.

1559
01:05:38.458 --> 01:05:40.041
so let's get to work ASAP.

1560
01:05:40.125 --> 01:05:41.542
Bobbi. you take Castle Vacuums.

1561
01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:45.000
Eden. you up for MinFloral?

1562
01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:46.625
Absolutely.

1563
01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:47.583
Excellent.

1564
01:05:53.166 --> 01:05:53.917
[knocking]

1565
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:54.959
Come in!

1566
01:05:57.542 --> 01:05:58.250
Hey. honey.

1567
01:05:58.291 --> 01:05:59.083
How was work today?

1568
01:05:59.125 --> 01:06:00.250
Good.

1569
01:06:00.291 --> 01:06:02.083
Did you cook?

1570
01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:05.125
No. it's a new client product.

1571
01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:07.250
MinFloral Air Freshener.

1572
01:06:07.333 --> 01:06:08.375
MinFloral?

1573
01:06:09.709 --> 01:06:11.500
Yeah I think it's because
it's pure minerals.

1574
01:06:11.583 --> 01:06:13.417
added with floral scents.

1575
01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.458
At first thought Min meant mini.

1576
01:06:15.542 --> 01:06:17.750
but this isn't that small. so.

1577
01:06:17.834 --> 01:06:18.709
Interesting.

1578
01:06:18.792 --> 01:06:20.000
Yeah.

1579
01:06:20.083 --> 01:06:21.417
So. I wanted to plan
out Friday's dinner.

1580
01:06:21.458 --> 01:06:22.625
Oh. what time does it start?

1581
01:06:22.709 --> 01:06:24.667
Well for once I wanna be early.

1582
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:27.166
So are you okay if I
picked you up at 5:30?

1583
01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:28.083
I'll be ready.

1584
01:06:28.125 --> 01:06:29.041
Great.

1585
01:06:29.125 --> 01:06:30.417
What's the dress code?

1586
01:06:30.458 --> 01:06:33.166
I'm wearing a suit
and a new tie.

1587
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:36.667
A new tie. hmm. okay!

1588
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:38.291
I'll be sure not to
embarrass you then.

1589

How's it coming together?

1593
01:07:01.375 --> 01:07:02.542
Good.

1594
01:07:02.625 --> 01:07:04.792
The market survey I put
together comes back tomorrow so

1595
01:07:04.834 --> 01:07:07.083
that'll help me fine-tune
what I'm going to present.

1596
01:07:07.166 --> 01:07:08.125
I can't wait to see it.

1597
01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:09.083
Yeah.

Hey.

1601
01:07:43.792 --> 01:07:45.834
Hey Riley. how you doing?

1602
01:07:45.917 --> 01:07:48.792
Good. I just wanted to
check on that freezer.

1603
01:07:48.875 --> 01:07:50.375
Is it running all right?

1604
01:07:50.458 --> 01:07:52.083
Ever since you fixed it.

1605
01:07:52.166 --> 01:07:54.000
It's got a few more years
on it now. thanks to you.

1606
01:07:54.083 --> 01:07:55.375
Good.

1607
01:07:55.458 --> 01:07:57.542
So what can I get you?

1608
01:07:57.583 --> 01:07:58.625
Oh nothing. I was
just passing by.

1609
01:07:58.709 --> 01:08:00.000
I thought I'd check in.

1610
01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:00.792
Okay.

1611
01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.458
Well how's that business doing?

1612
01:08:02.542 --> 01:08:04.709
I see your balloon floating
around every morning.

1613
01:08:04.792 --> 01:08:06.375
It's been popular lately.

1614
01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:08.583
Good. good.

1615
01:08:08.667 --> 01:08:11.709
So have you heard
from Eden lately?

1616
01:08:12.917 --> 01:08:13.709
No. no.

1617
01:08:13.792 --> 01:08:15.083
Not since she went back home.

1618
01:08:15.166 --> 01:08:16.750
Well you could
call her. you know.

1619
01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:21.375
Yeah. I think she's moved on.

1620
01:08:21.417 --> 01:08:24.583
And that's okay.

1621
01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:25.917
As long as she's happy.

1622
01:08:27.208 --> 01:08:29.083
You're a good kid.
you know that?

1623
01:08:33.625 --> 01:08:35.792
Are you nervous about the pitch?

1624
01:08:35.875 --> 01:08:37.750
No. not really.

1625
01:08:37.834 --> 01:08:40.417
But maybe I should be.
because then I'd come across

1626
01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.125
as excited about it.

1627
01:08:42.208 --> 01:08:44.709
Well I'll admit. air
fresheners are pretty dull.

1628
01:08:44.792 --> 01:08:46.291
Yup.

1629
01:08:46.375 --> 01:08:48.583
Could you ask Reese for
a different assignment?

1630
01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:51.250
It was either this or vacuums.

1631
01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:52.542
Oh wow.

1632
01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:53.500
Mhmm.

1633
01:08:53.583 --> 01:08:54.583
Nah. it's fine.

1634
01:08:54.667 --> 01:08:56.959
It's work. right?

1635
01:08:58.375 --> 01:09:00.875
Well. you know. you could
still make a change.

1636
01:09:00.959 --> 01:09:02.208
What do you mean?

1637
01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:04.792
You know. quit your job.

1638
01:09:06.125 --> 01:09:06.917
I can't.

1639
01:09:07.792 --> 01:09:10.959
You just. you don't
seem happy to be back.

1640
01:09:11.875 --> 01:09:14.959
And maybe it's not just
because of the job.

1641
01:09:21.583 --> 01:09:22.375
Imagine.

1642
01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:25.959
You feel a migraine coming on.

1643
01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:30.583
The weight of the world
constantly on your shoulders.

1644
01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:33.750
But whether you're
at work or at home.

1645
01:09:33.834 --> 01:09:38.458
MinFloral can be a
sanctuary and a shield.

1646
01:09:39.166 --> 01:09:43.792
Let the natural mineral
aromas lift your spirits.

1647
01:09:44.417 --> 01:09:48.375
invigorate your body.
ward off the stressors

1648
01:09:48.458 --> 01:09:51.291
that come at you
in every direction.

1649
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.208
In an array of award-winning
and inventive aromas.

1650
01:09:57.291 --> 01:10:00.625
MinFloral is the element missing

1651
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:04.625
to feel stronger and renewed.

1652
01:10:06.083 --> 01:10:07.667
MinFloral.

1653
01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:12.875
Mineral ingredients. floral
scents. fresher life.

1654
01:10:13.625 --> 01:10:14.750
[audience clapping]

1655
01:10:14.834 --> 01:10:15.709
Thank you.

1656
01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:19.667
I like it.

1657
01:10:19.709 --> 01:10:20.834
What type of ad
campaigns do you see

1658
01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:22.208
being most effective
for MinFloral?

1659
01:10:22.291 --> 01:10:24.834
Well the standard for the
air freshener industry

1660
01:10:24.875 --> 01:10:28.667
is print-based. but I
think that's outdated.

1661
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:30.834
I want to get you on video

1662
01:10:30.917 --> 01:10:32.750
for the coupon
and shopping apps.

1663
01:10:32.834 --> 01:10:34.834
as well as targeted campaigns

1664
01:10:34.917 --> 01:10:37.834
in the online and
broadcast space.

1665
01:10:37.917 --> 01:10:41.000
Targeted to your
demographic. of course.

1666
01:10:41.041 --> 01:10:41.917
I love it.

1667
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.625
One question though.

1668
01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:46.000
I don't think the
hot air balloon fit.

1669
01:10:46.083 --> 01:10:46.875
Oh.

1670
01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:50.667
Eden?

1671
01:10:52.959 --> 01:10:56.417
Ah. well. we can
leave that part out.

1672
01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:02.834
I was going for a parallel
of open. fresh air.

1673
01:11:03.333 --> 01:11:07.250
like when you're in
a hot air balloon.

1674
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.208
Oh.

1675
01:11:10.291 --> 01:11:12.583
All ads will get your final
approval before we run.

1676
01:11:12.667 --> 01:11:15.583
so don't worry about anything
that seems out of place.

1677
01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:16.875
Right. [chuckling]

1678
01:11:16.917 --> 01:11:18.709
If we hurry. we can
get these locked in now

1679
01:11:18.792 --> 01:11:20.500
while ad inventory is high.

1680
01:11:20.583 --> 01:11:22.500
I think we can negotiate
better placements now

1681
01:11:22.583 --> 01:11:24.417
rather than waiting
for too long.

1682
01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:25.750
That sounds sensible.

1683
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.250
You had me slightly worried

1684
01:11:30.333 --> 01:11:32.041
with the hot air balloon thing.
but you handled it great.

1685
01:11:32.125 --> 01:11:33.083
Thanks.

1686
01:11:33.166 --> 01:11:34.917
There's a lot to do in a
short time on MinFloral.

1687
01:11:34.959 --> 01:11:36.417
but I think you can do
it if you're willing

1688
01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:37.709
to put in some extra time.

1689
01:11:38.792 --> 01:11:39.792
And then I have a
plant fertilizer client

1690
01:11:39.875 --> 01:11:41.625
that I want to assign to you.

1691
01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:43.542
Plant fertilizer?

1692
01:11:43.625 --> 01:11:44.750
The landscape and
gardening industry's

1693
01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:45.834
number three company.

1694
01:11:45.917 --> 01:11:47.917
They're aggressively
trying to take the lead.

1695
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.709
So. I'll add that
to your accounts.

1696
01:11:52.083 --> 01:11:53.333
Actually...

1697
01:11:55.959 --> 01:11:57.959
Maybe you should give
that to someone else.

1698
01:11:59.083 --> 01:12:00.542
What do you mean?

1699
01:12:00.625 --> 01:12:04.583
I mean. maybe you should
give all my accounts

1700
01:12:04.625 --> 01:12:05.500
to someone else.

1701
01:12:40.166 --> 01:12:42.375
[knocking]

1702
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:45.500
Hey.

1703
01:12:45.583 --> 01:12:46.875
Hey.

1704
01:12:46.959 --> 01:12:47.750
Hmm.

1705
01:12:49.542 --> 01:12:51.959
I'm so sorry. ugh.

1706
01:12:52.041 --> 01:12:54.667
Today was crazy and
I totally forgot.

1707
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:55.875
I'll be right out.

1708
01:12:59.041 --> 01:12:59.875
Okay.

1709
01:13:01.875 --> 01:13:03.375
The freeway's going to
be a mess right now.

1710
01:13:03.458 --> 01:13:05.959
But we can probably make up
the time on another route.

1711
01:13:06.041 --> 01:13:07.667
Good.

1712
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:09.500
So work was crazy today. huh?

1713
01:13:09.542 --> 01:13:10.917
Sort of.

1714
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.583
I quit my job.

1715
01:13:12.667 --> 01:13:13.500
You quit?

1716
01:13:13.542 --> 01:13:14.500
You did?

1717
01:13:14.542 --> 01:13:15.625
Yep.

1718
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:17.000
Is everything all right?

1719
01:13:17.083 --> 01:13:18.834
That's kind of sudden. isn't it?

1720
01:13:18.917 --> 01:13:20.667
I mean what are you going to do?

1721
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:22.709
I don't know yet.

1722
01:13:22.792 --> 01:13:24.000
But I wasn't happy.

1723
01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:26.125
You know maybe you
should think it over.

1724
01:13:26.208 --> 01:13:28.083
You could talk to
Reese on Monday.

1725
01:13:28.166 --> 01:13:29.792
No. it's fine.

1726
01:13:30.542 --> 01:13:31.667
Okay.

1727
01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:32.583
If you say so.

1728
01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:37.834
I didn't know your job
made you so unhappy.

1729
01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:42.250
I don't think it's
just my job though.

1730
01:13:43.792 --> 01:13:44.500
What do you mean?

1731
01:13:47.792 --> 01:13:48.625
All this time.

1732
01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:50.458
I know.

1733
01:13:51.583 --> 01:13:54.500
It's hard because I love

1734
01:13:54.583 --> 01:13:56.458
and care for you so much.

1735
01:13:58.583 --> 01:13:59.500
I feel the same about you.

1736
01:14:02.083 --> 01:14:04.542
I guess we were never really
in love with each other.

1737
01:14:04.625 --> 01:14:05.625
It was comfortable.

1738
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:07.917
And we let it go on.

1739
01:14:08.834 --> 01:14:09.625
Yeah.

1740
01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:13.917
So when did you figure this out?

1741
01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:16.083
When I got back.

1742
01:14:17.625 --> 01:14:20.500
But. I guess it
started in Tahoe.

1743
01:14:21.959 --> 01:14:25.458
There was a friend there. Riley.

1744
01:14:26.583 --> 01:14:32.625
And I realized that
what I felt for him was

1745
01:14:33.125 --> 01:14:34.959
different than how
I feel for you.

1746
01:14:35.875 --> 01:14:36.667
Oh.

1747
01:14:39.834 --> 01:14:40.875
Are you upset?

1748
01:14:43.875 --> 01:14:45.166
No.

1749
01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:48.959
Actually I know
exactly how you feel.

1750
01:14:51.208 --> 01:14:53.083
There's something I
wanna tell you too.

1751
01:14:54.208 --> 01:14:56.041
You and I started
dating but as it went on

1752
01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:58.250
we spent time with
each other's friends.

1753
01:14:58.333 --> 01:14:59.834
A lot of time.

1754
01:14:59.917 --> 01:15:01.125
Well. I started to...

1755
01:15:01.166 --> 01:15:02.458
Kate!

1756
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.333
Yeah.

1757
01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:06.291
I couldn't bring myself
to tell either of you.

1758
01:15:06.375 --> 01:15:08.917
I would hate myself if
I ever came between you.

1759
01:15:10.166 --> 01:15:11.125
I get it.

1760
01:15:12.834 --> 01:15:17.375
I want you. and
Kate. to be happy.

1761
01:15:19.333 --> 01:15:20.041
You do?

1762
01:15:20.125 --> 01:15:21.000
Definitely.

1763
01:15:24.583 --> 01:15:26.917
This day has gone very
differently than I thought.

1764
01:15:27.667 --> 01:15:28.834
For me too.

1765
01:15:28.917 --> 01:15:29.750
Yeah.

1766
01:15:30.667 --> 01:15:32.333
Oh. your dinner!

1767
01:15:34.166 --> 01:15:36.166
You know what. don't
worry about it.

1768
01:15:39.208 --> 01:15:41.375
No. you can still
make this. yes.

1769
01:15:44.125 --> 01:15:46.375
[knocking]

1770
01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:48.792
Eden. what's going on?

1771
01:15:48.875 --> 01:15:50.667
Go put on a nice dress.

1772
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:51.709
What. why?

1773
01:15:51.792 --> 01:15:53.709
Because you are going
to a dinner party

1774
01:15:53.792 --> 01:15:54.917
in honor of Michael.

1775
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.500
What. I am?

1776
01:15:56.583 --> 01:15:57.333
Yeah.

1777
01:15:57.417 --> 01:15:58.625
Hi Kate.

1778
01:15:58.709 --> 01:16:00.750
Okay Eden. seriously.
what's going on?

1779
01:16:00.834 --> 01:16:02.834
There's not a lot of
time. but to sum it up.

1780
01:16:02.917 --> 01:16:04.917
Michael and I broke up.

1781
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.166
and Michael has had feelings
for you for a while.

1782
01:16:08.208 --> 01:16:11.333
and as I think of
it more and more.

1783
01:16:11.417 --> 01:16:14.834
you like him too. and
I couldn't be happier

1784
01:16:14.917 --> 01:16:15.834
for the both of you.

1785
01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:17.083
Okay. wait. what?!

1786
01:16:17.166 --> 01:16:18.583
Just think about it.

1787
01:16:18.667 --> 01:16:22.166
Even in Tahoe. you were
worried about me. yes.

1788
01:16:22.208 --> 01:16:25.000
but you didn't want
Michael to get hurt.

1789
01:16:25.083 --> 01:16:27.208
And you've been such a
good friend to me but

1790
01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:28.208
I don't want you to miss out

1791
01:16:28.291 --> 01:16:30.250
on something special with him.

1792
01:16:30.333 --> 01:16:32.041
And speaking of special.

1793
01:16:32.125 --> 01:16:35.041
Michael's dinner started
about five minutes ago.

1794
01:16:35.125 --> 01:16:36.834
So what do you say. Kate?

1795
01:16:36.917 --> 01:16:37.875
Will you come with me?

1796
01:16:37.959 --> 01:16:38.834
Be my date?

1797
01:16:40.417 --> 01:16:41.250
Yes.

1798
01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:45.041
What will you do?

1799
01:16:45.125 --> 01:16:46.083
I don't know yet.

1800
01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:47.709
Don't worry about it.

1801
01:16:47.792 --> 01:16:48.417
Have fun.

1802
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.375
Eden.

1803
01:16:55.417 --> 01:16:56.250
Yeah.

1804
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.458
[soft guitar music]

1805
01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:22.834
You all have a nice day.

1806
01:17:22.917 --> 01:17:23.625
Thanks. bye.

1807
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.125
How was it?

1808
01:17:27.125 --> 01:17:28.709
Oh. fine.

1809
01:17:28.792 --> 01:17:29.750
No wind really.

1810
01:17:29.792 --> 01:17:31.250
Good.

1811
01:17:31.333 --> 01:17:33.375
Did the no-show come
while we were in the air?

1812
01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:34.166
Nope.

1813
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:35.250
I guess they just forgot.

1814
01:17:39.417 --> 01:17:40.291
Who's that?

1815
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.250
I guess that's the no-show.

1816
01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.500
Maybe they just
got the time wrong.

1817
01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:50.083
Wait.

1818
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.083
[energetic music]

1819
01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:59.959
Did I miss the tour?

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.750
That was you?

1821
01:18:01.834 --> 01:18:04.333
I drove as fast as
I could to get here.

1822
01:18:04.417 --> 01:18:06.125
Sorry. you missed it.

1823
01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:08.291
Ugh. that's too bad.

1824
01:18:11.166 --> 01:18:14.125
You know. normally
there's no refunds.

1825
01:18:14.166 --> 01:18:16.709
but maybe I could take you up

1826
01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:19.125
for a private tour another day.

1827
01:18:19.208 --> 01:18:20.667
if you're in town for a while.

1828
01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:22.333
I am.

1829
01:18:23.125 --> 01:18:24.500
And I'd like that.

1830
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:29.917
Maybe I might give
you a good review.

1831
01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:35.417
I didn't think you
were coming back.

1832
01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.542
It's like you said.

1833
01:18:37.375 --> 01:18:39.709
I needed time to figure
it out for myself.

1834
01:18:41.375 --> 01:18:42.333
And have you?

1835
01:18:45.875 --> 01:18:46.750
I think so.

1836
01:18:48.375 --> 01:18:49.208
Good.

1837
01:18:50.458 --> 01:18:52.375
'Cause I didn't
want to wait another

1838
01:18:52.458 --> 01:18:55.125
10 or 15 years to see you again.

1839
01:18:56.917 --> 01:18:57.542
Me neither.

1840
01:19:02.083 --> 01:19:04.709
[uplifting music]

1841
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:19.250
I had two resorts
here contact me

1842
01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:21.417
about running a
marketing push for them.

1843
01:19:23.041 --> 01:19:24.166
I'm not surprised.

1844
01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:25.959
I think I'm gonna
pick one to work on.

1845
01:19:27.583 --> 01:19:28.917
Good for you.

1846
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.166
Nice. huh?

1847
01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:32.959
This whole working for
yourself idea isn't bad.

1848
01:19:34.917 --> 01:19:36.542
See why I like it?

1849
01:19:36.583 --> 01:19:37.417
I do.

1850
01:19:38.959 --> 01:19:39.750
I really do.
