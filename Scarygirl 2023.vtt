3
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.033
Keeper!

4
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.600
Welcome back to the Yellow Onion.

5
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.433
It's an honor to do business
with you again.

6
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:02.533
My bounty hunters
have searched high and low

7
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.566
for this fine specimen of a Squiggler.

8
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.300
It isn't big enough.

9
00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:20.033
He will not be pleased.

10
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.500
I assure you that
this is the biggest Squiggler there is.

11
00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:25.700
My boys have...

12
00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:28.166
We are still waiting
on what you promised us.

13
00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:35.833
The Giant Octopus?

14
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.433
But we have spent years looking
and there's no trace of it.

15
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.633
It's a myth!

16
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.633
Keeper. please. Don't ask...

17
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.833
Find that octopus
or consider yourself finished.

18
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600
Alright!

19
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.366
Who's up for another round?

20
00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:10.300
I think I'm tapped out.

21
00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:12.866
How about you. Egg?

22
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.066
In hindsight perhaps getting a loan
from Chihoohoo wasn't the greatest idea.

23
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.833
How much do we owe him now?

24
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.533
Idiots!

25
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.066
Do you want to make some money?

26
00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:33.400
There's a big reward for anyone
who can find me the giant octopus.

27
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.233
See? I told you
everything would work out.

28
00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:42.633
So. fellows.

29
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.400
what do you say
we play just one more round?

30
00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:44.666
Morning! Come on in!

31
00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:49.366
Okay. I'm up!

32
00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:52.900
Check out what I built last night.

33
00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:02.600
So I decided to play around
with the spectral ranges of sea glass

34
00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:04.566
to test their reflection levels.

35
00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:11.900
I wanted to use
the leftover sea glass for something

36
00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:14.366
since it didn't work
with the light beamer.

37
00:06:15.266 --> 00:06:19.600
I just know if I had the right crystal
I could intensify its power tenfold.

38
00:06:19.666 --> 00:06:22.133
I could help the whole Peninsula.

39
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.966
In the meantime. are you ready to see?

40
00:06:29.733 --> 00:06:31.333
Could I borrow some of your light?

41
00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:33.866
Great!

42
00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:35.300
You go here.

43
00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:38.166
Okay. and...

44
00:06:39.033 --> 00:06:40.466
Here we go!

45
00:06:57.866 --> 00:06:59.400
Arkie?

46
00:06:59.466 --> 00:07:00.733
Time to get up!

47
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.933
Coming. Dad!

48
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.233
Let's go!

49
00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:11.933
Nothing to it but to do it!

50
00:07:26.733 --> 00:07:28.066
No!

51
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.100
I've still got to stick that landing.

52
00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:56.066
Dad's been busy.

53
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.166
- Good morning. Arkie!
- Good morning. Dad!

54
00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:31.333
Come on! It's practice time.

55
00:08:33.066 --> 00:08:34.500
Great.

56
00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:38.800
I know it's hard.
but you just need to keep trying.

57
00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:41.866
You know. dad. repeating the same task

58
00:08:41.933 --> 00:08:45.200
and expecting different results
isn't a great life plan.

59
00:08:45.933 --> 00:08:48.033
Don't give me that. smarty-pants.

60
00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:50.600
You'll be reviving plants in no time.

61
00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:53.533
That's what you keep saying
over and over...

62
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.933
Yes. yes. yes. Don't give up. kiddo.

63
00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:57.833
For me.

64
00:09:20.066 --> 00:09:21.366
I'm sorry. Dad.

65
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.433
I just can't do it.

66
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.233
Arkie. we just need to keep trying.

67
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.633
That beam.

68
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.266
That beam is destroying
all life on the Peninsula.

69
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.633
If they don't stop soon
this planet won't last much longer.

70
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.066
But who would create something
that does that?

71
00:09:54.366 --> 00:09:56.500
Perhaps they don't know
what they're doing.

72
00:09:56.866 --> 00:10:00.100
- If we went there and told them...
- We can't go there. Arkie.

73
00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:03.766
The creatures in the city
use machines to drain the sun.

74
00:10:03.833 --> 00:10:06.400
- They're dangerous and selfish.
- But...

75
00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:10.500
They're different to us.
They don't see the world like we do.

76
00:10:11.466 --> 00:10:13.433
It's safer if we stay here.

77
00:10:14.266 --> 00:10:15.366
Trust me.

78
00:10:23.166 --> 00:10:24.466
But what do I always say?

79
00:10:24.966 --> 00:10:27.166
There's always something you can do...

80
00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:30.066
- To make the world better.
- To make the world better.

81
00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:31.300
Exactly!

82
00:10:31.366 --> 00:10:32.733
So come on. kiddo.

83
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.700
Let's go help these plants.

84
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.133
Good morning. everyone!

85
00:10:54.266 --> 00:10:57.333
Alrighty. let's get you all charged up.

86
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.133
- Arkie. could you...?
- Already on it!

87
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.700
Dad?

88
00:11:13.766 --> 00:11:17.366
Do you ever think that maybe
not all machines are bad?

89
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.400
I bet they could even help us
intensify the sun's beams.

90
00:11:21.466 --> 00:11:24.533
Arkie. you know how I feel about this.

91
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.666
Machines are dangerous.

92
00:11:26.733 --> 00:11:29.466
But aren't the mirrors
a kind of machine?

93
00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:31.633
And they help the plants.

94
00:11:32.133 --> 00:11:35.100
Well. no. the mirrors
don't take from the sun.

95
00:11:35.166 --> 00:11:37.233
They only amplify what's already there.

96
00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:41.666
And they're powered by our
very own impressive muscles.

97
00:11:41.733 --> 00:11:44.533
not unnatural gadgets and gizmos.

98
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.300
- But I really...
- It's just not the same thing.

99
00:11:48.266 --> 00:11:51.566
Besides we are octopuses.

100
00:11:51.633 --> 00:11:55.233
We're far more impressive
than any piece of technology.

101
00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:58.200
Or at least you are.

102
00:12:08.966 --> 00:12:10.000
Do you know what?

103
00:12:10.066 --> 00:12:13.266
I think it's time for you
to take on a little more responsibility.

104
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.533
Wait. What?

105
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.366
Are you sure I'm ready?

106
00:12:19.033 --> 00:12:22.466
- Maybe we could practice a bit more...
- We can't practice forever. Arkie.

107
00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:24.633
What is it you always say?

108
00:12:25.133 --> 00:12:28.800
There's nothing to it. so just do it.

109
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.900
Yes. Something like that.

110
00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:44.400
Don't worry. You'll be great.

111
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.133
Remember what we learnt.

112
00:12:50.466 --> 00:12:55.400
Hold steady. stay focused
and move the wheel slowly.

113
00:12:57.466 --> 00:12:58.700
You've got this. kiddo.

114
00:13:07.933 --> 00:13:10.200
That's it. Keep it steady.

115
00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:14.333
And here we go!

116
00:13:29.766 --> 00:13:32.566
Okay. little ones. keep the line moving.

117
00:13:32.633 --> 00:13:34.133
Once you're fully charged up.

118
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.266
go out there
and give those plants some sun.

119
00:13:48.033 --> 00:13:49.300
Okay. Arkie.

120
00:13:49.366 --> 00:13:50.666
We need a little more light.

121
00:13:50.733 --> 00:13:53.966
So let's lift that mirror very slowly.

122
00:13:57.633 --> 00:14:00.533
I can't hold it!

123
00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:03.433
Are you okay back there?

124
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.200
Let me know if you need a hand.

125
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.433
My tentacle!

126
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.833
It's slipping!

127
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.166
Arkie. where are you going?

128
00:14:35.133 --> 00:14:37.500
Somewhere I can't mess anything else up.

129
00:15:09.566 --> 00:15:10.733
Hey. Steve.

130
00:15:11.266 --> 00:15:12.433
I'm okay.

131
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.733
I just wish I could convince dad
that machines aren't all bad.

132
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.866
Show him what I can do.

133
00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:42.633
This.

134
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.133
This is exactly what I need
to finish the light beamer.

135
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.833
Come on. Steve. We've got work to do.

136
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.333
Find me a mythical creature
that doesn't exist!

137
00:16:09.133 --> 00:16:10.700
Who does the Keeper think she is?

138
00:16:10.766 --> 00:16:13.100
We've already searched
this planet ten times over.

139
00:16:13.633 --> 00:16:15.933
It's not out here!

140
00:16:20.033 --> 00:16:23.633
We're more likely to find brain cells
in River Bandit's head. boss?

141
00:16:26.766 --> 00:16:28.266
I have brain cells...

142
00:16:28.633 --> 00:16:29.666
Hello?

143
00:16:29.733 --> 00:16:32.466
Bunniguru and Egg reporting for duty.

144
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.300
- Hello? Chihoohoo?
- Not those two again.

145
00:16:38.366 --> 00:16:40.200
Yes. Keep up the good work.

146
00:16:41.966 --> 00:16:45.266
Boss. why are you letting
the rabbit tag along?

147
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.566
Because when it turns out I was right
and there is no octopus

148
00:16:48.733 --> 00:16:50.866
we can blame it
on those two knuckleheads.

149
00:16:50.933 --> 00:16:53.933
Okay. let's do one more sweep
and then we can get out of this dump.

150
00:16:55.266 --> 00:16:57.166
Hello. Chihoohoo.

151
00:16:58.266 --> 00:16:59.400
He's probably busy.

152
00:17:01.966 --> 00:17:04.033
Take it all in. Egg.

153
00:17:04.366 --> 00:17:07.233
Excitement. adventure. per diems!

154
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.000
We're in the open skies
heading to far-off lands

155
00:17:11.066 --> 00:17:13.966
searching for a rare and wild creature.

156
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:17.166
The promise of huge stacks of money
at our fingertips.

157
00:17:18.166 --> 00:17:20.900
This is really going to turn things
around for us. buddy.

158
00:17:20.966 --> 00:17:22.733
I can feel it.

159
00:17:53.566 --> 00:17:55.366
Twice in one day?

160
00:17:55.633 --> 00:17:58.333
Maybee. what are you up to?

161
00:18:05.766 --> 00:18:07.366
Arkie. are you there?

162
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:08.933
Arkie!

163
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.733
Where are you. Arkie?

164
00:18:13.633 --> 00:18:14.766
Arkie!

165
00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:21.266
Arkie!

166
00:18:25.933 --> 00:18:27.166
Dad?

167
00:18:34.566 --> 00:18:39.333
Okay. if this baby works
it'll definitely change dad's mind.

168
00:18:39.866 --> 00:18:41.333
This way. please.

169
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.900
One super-charged glowbug coming up!

170
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.566
Nothing to it but to do it.

171
00:19:00.366 --> 00:19:01.766
Come on.

172
00:19:06.266 --> 00:19:07.566
Please work.

173
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.200
Yes!

174
00:19:17.766 --> 00:19:19.066
Here we go!

175
00:19:21.466 --> 00:19:22.900
Almost there!

176
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.000
Come on. open!

177
00:19:37.366 --> 00:19:38.366
Steve!

178
00:19:45.966 --> 00:19:47.633
Arkie. are you in here?

179
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.100
Arkie!

180
00:19:57.766 --> 00:20:00.400
The light! It burns!

181
00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:04.100
- Turn right!
- Which way is right?

182
00:20:07.766 --> 00:20:09.466
Egg. make it stop!

183
00:20:14.866 --> 00:20:15.933
Carrots!

184
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.766
Collision ahead.

185
00:20:18.833 --> 00:20:20.233
Pull up.

186
00:20:20.566 --> 00:20:21.700
Don't worry. Egg.

187
00:20:22.066 --> 00:20:23.466
I've got this.

188
00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:30.433
And here we go!

189
00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.233
Collision ahead.

190
00:20:35.766 --> 00:20:36.800
Pull up.

191
00:20:43.766 --> 00:20:45.066
Yes!

192
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.066
Egg?

193
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.033
Steve?

194
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.833
I can't turn it off!

195
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.300
Steve!

196
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.100
Steve!

197
00:22:08.133 --> 00:22:10.000
What was that light?

198
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.333
Spin us around. Rebel King.

199
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.900
I want to see what's over there.

200
00:22:23.166 --> 00:22:24.166
Wait.

201
00:22:25.266 --> 00:22:27.500
Is that an octopus?

202
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.433
That is one huge Squiggler.

203
00:22:32.266 --> 00:22:33.433
It's an octopus!

204
00:22:37.766 --> 00:22:39.566
We found one. boys!

205
00:22:53.966 --> 00:22:55.700
What are you waiting for?

206
00:22:55.766 --> 00:22:56.866
Go get him!

207
00:23:18.733 --> 00:23:20.300
I've got you!

208
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.166
That's it!

209
00:23:38.233 --> 00:23:40.833
I'm going to skewer this sucker!

210
00:23:42.666 --> 00:23:45.466
The bounty
is for a live octopus. you moron!

211
00:23:45.533 --> 00:23:47.966
If the creature dies. we all die.

212
00:23:48.033 --> 00:23:50.366
- Stop him. Rebel King.
- On it. boss.

213
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.433
Come here. little calamari!

214
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.466
What?

215
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.333
No!

216
00:24:14.233 --> 00:24:17.233
Looks like I got me a mythical beast.

217
00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:19.233
Victory!

218
00:24:19.333 --> 00:24:20.400
Yes!

219
00:24:40.566 --> 00:24:41.733
What the hell?

220
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.633
Have you ever seen anything like them?

221
00:24:47.933 --> 00:24:49.366
That one is so cute!

222
00:24:52.366 --> 00:24:53.566
Can I say hi?

223
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.066
No. they're strangers.
I should tell dad.

224
00:24:58.233 --> 00:25:01.933
But they don't exactly look dangerous.

225
00:25:03.833 --> 00:25:06.900
And they're clearly
have no idea what they're doing.

226
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.433
This isn't working!

227
00:25:12.666 --> 00:25:16.133
In fact. they look downright hopeless.

228
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.133
Do you know
what this situation calls for?

229
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.466
My trusty Book of Proverbs.

230
00:25:25.533 --> 00:25:27.033
- Here is a good one.
- Yes.

231
00:25:27.266 --> 00:25:28.300
I'm going to do it.

232
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.466
Embrace surprises like a hot fish.

233
00:25:31.866 --> 00:25:32.966
With tongs.

234
00:25:33.033 --> 00:25:34.233
Okay. here I go.

235
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.066
I love surprises.

236
00:25:42.866 --> 00:25:46.133
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

237
00:25:46.533 --> 00:25:47.666
Scared?

238
00:25:47.733 --> 00:25:50.066
No. We are fine.

239
00:25:50.333 --> 00:25:51.733
Are you sure?

240
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.400
Totally. Undoubtedly. No problem.

241
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.966
Bunniguru. at your service.

242
00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.666
Philosopher. Renaissance rabbit.

243
00:25:59.733 --> 00:26:02.633
And a little exploring on the side
to make ends meet.

244
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.600
This is my travelling companion.

245
00:26:05.666 --> 00:26:08.866
co-pilot and general good egg. Egg.

246
00:26:11.233 --> 00:26:13.566
She's a little unwell right now.

247
00:26:13.933 --> 00:26:16.600
Normally she's a bit of a "crack-up".

248
00:26:17.066 --> 00:26:18.066
Get it?

249
00:26:20.266 --> 00:26:21.500
Yes. I deserved that.

250
00:26:22.466 --> 00:26:25.600
Once we get her back to the city.
she'll be her old self again.

251
00:26:26.066 --> 00:26:27.566
The city?

252
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.000
Did you fly from there in this?

253
00:26:30.066 --> 00:26:31.500
Yes.

254
00:26:31.566 --> 00:26:35.100
This trusty metal stallion
has never failed us.

255
00:26:38.033 --> 00:26:40.433
Well. until now.

256
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.733
I didn't introduce myself.

257
00:26:46.433 --> 00:26:47.533
I'm Arkie.

258
00:26:49.833 --> 00:26:52.566
Is that a... tentacle?

259
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.900
Yes. but it doesn't work very well.

260
00:26:56.233 --> 00:26:57.666
It's not like my dad's.

261
00:26:57.733 --> 00:26:59.300
He's a real octopus.

262
00:26:59.366 --> 00:27:01.966
Your dad is an octopus?

263
00:27:02.033 --> 00:27:03.033
Yes.

264
00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.033
I wish he was here to see this.

265
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.233
Even he'd have to admit
this is amazing.

266
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.233
I mean. look at all these parts!

267
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.166
And what is that?

268
00:27:16.233 --> 00:27:21.700
So. Egg and I are on a bit
of an explorer's holiday.

269
00:27:21.766 --> 00:27:24.200
And we've never met a real octopus.

270
00:27:25.233 --> 00:27:28.166
We'd love to say hello
before we head home.

271
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.500
You're going back to the city?

272
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.800
Today?

273
00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:48.966
What was that?

274
00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:51.166
I've got to get home!

275
00:27:54.366 --> 00:27:56.200
Chihoohoo left without us!

276
00:27:57.266 --> 00:27:58.600
That must mean...

277
00:28:11.566 --> 00:28:12.966
What is all this?

278
00:28:16.966 --> 00:28:18.200
No.

279
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.466
Dad!

280
00:28:39.166 --> 00:28:40.200
Dad!

281
00:28:43.233 --> 00:28:44.300
Dad!

282
00:29:09.366 --> 00:29:11.366
This is all my fault.

283
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.666
If I hadn't built this...

284
00:29:15.433 --> 00:29:18.900
Sorry. kid.
It looks like someone took him.

285
00:29:18.966 --> 00:29:20.666
Who would do that?

286
00:29:20.733 --> 00:29:24.666
I don't know for certain.
but that looked like a city ship.

287
00:29:24.733 --> 00:29:26.400
They're probably taking him there.

288
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.066
Right. Egg?

289
00:29:41.466 --> 00:29:42.966
You're heading that way. right?

290
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.133
See. Egg?

291
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.533
Everything always works out.

292
00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:02.400
We might not have the octopus.

293
00:30:02.466 --> 00:30:05.800
but here we have
the very next best thing.

294
00:30:05.866 --> 00:30:08.233
A tentacle to trade in for a reward.

295
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.266
I know.

296
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:16.666
But with our debt and your new crack
we have to go back with something.

297
00:30:17.033 --> 00:30:18.833
It's looking serious.

298
00:30:19.966 --> 00:30:21.200
Are you coming?

299
00:30:21.366 --> 00:30:22.566
Coming!

300
00:30:36.433 --> 00:30:38.433
Are you sure you both know the way?

301
00:30:39.133 --> 00:30:40.533
Absolutely!

302
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.400
Egg and I have natural
navigational instincts.

303
00:30:43.733 --> 00:30:49.133
We could find a pebble
in a sea of similar looking pebbles.

304
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.100
You know. I've never left
the Peninsula before.

305
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.266
What was I thinking?

306
00:31:05.533 --> 00:31:07.333
How am I meant to find my dad?

307
00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:10.966
Well. it's not like
you're doing it alone.

308
00:31:11.466 --> 00:31:14.666
Egg and I will help you
one hundred percent of the way.

309
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.900
Goodbye. you three.

310
00:31:21.333 --> 00:31:23.566
Keep an eye on the plants
while I'm gone.

311
00:31:25.166 --> 00:31:27.000
Okay. let's do this.

312
00:31:39.333 --> 00:31:43.400
Good morning. my dear citizens
of the City of Light.

313
00:31:43.466 --> 00:31:47.033
Remember. every day is a new opportunity

314
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.933
to be a better version of yourself.

315
00:31:50.533 --> 00:31:53.500
To eliminate the flaws
that hold you back.

316
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.633
I can make you magnificent.

317
00:32:20.566 --> 00:32:21.800
You found one?

318
00:32:23.666 --> 00:32:24.866
Let me see it.

319
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.600
It'll have to do.

320
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.433
Put it in the machine.

321
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.200
Initiating DNA test number 3851.

322
00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:50.833
Crystal activated.

323
00:32:51.066 --> 00:32:53.700
Initiating solar energy extraction.

324
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.800
Generating human genome sequence.

325
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.400
Initializing DNA reconstruction.

326
00:33:39.066 --> 00:33:41.366
Life form reconstruction failed.

327
00:33:42.333 --> 00:33:44.733
This squiggler is never
going to be strong enough.

328
00:33:45.066 --> 00:33:47.533
I need that octopus.

329
00:33:47.633 --> 00:33:50.766
I've sent Chihoohoo on another
full scout of the planet.

330
00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:54.900
It's been made clear what he'll lose
if he returns empty-handed.

331
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.733
It is imperative that we find him.

332
00:33:57.933 --> 00:33:59.300
Do you understand?

333
00:34:02.066 --> 00:34:04.533
He's the only thing
that can bring her back.

334
00:34:10.533 --> 00:34:14.633
Who's got two thumbs
and just found what you are looking for?

335
00:34:16.233 --> 00:34:17.666
This guy!

336
00:34:18.433 --> 00:34:19.500
Me!

337
00:34:38.533 --> 00:34:39.700
Keeper!

338
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.066
So nice to see you again.

339
00:34:42.133 --> 00:34:44.000
I like what you've done with the place.

340
00:34:44.066 --> 00:34:46.533
It's very overlord chic.

341
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.133
Show me this octopus.

342
00:35:13.733 --> 00:35:15.000
It's really him!

343
00:35:16.533 --> 00:35:21.400
I believe there is a little matter
of a sizeable reward?

344
00:35:22.033 --> 00:35:23.066
It's done.

345
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.433
Thank you. Keeper.

346
00:35:27.966 --> 00:35:30.400
It's always a pleasure
doing business with you.

347
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.100
You know. kid.

348
00:35:51.466 --> 00:35:55.966
I have just the thing
to pass the time on long trips.

349
00:35:57.833 --> 00:36:02.100
You'll never get lost
when your shoes are made of breadcrumbs.

350
00:36:03.766 --> 00:36:04.766
Shoes.

351
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.133
Wait for me!

352
00:36:18.266 --> 00:36:21.300
Trespassers!

353
00:36:23.466 --> 00:36:25.566
Did you hear that?

354
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.733
Filthy trespassers!

355
00:36:54.433 --> 00:36:55.700
Put me down!

356
00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:59.966
Bunniguru!

357
00:37:00.233 --> 00:37:01.700
Egg!

358
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.200
Arkie?

359
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.166
Dad?

360
00:37:56.333 --> 00:37:59.266
Hang on. I'm coming!

361
00:38:12.533 --> 00:38:13.566
Arkie!

362
00:38:43.833 --> 00:38:44.833
Arkie.

363
00:38:46.166 --> 00:38:47.500
Let me help you.

364
00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:30.366
What just happened?

365
00:39:30.666 --> 00:39:34.000
Incoming!

366
00:39:36.466 --> 00:39:37.866
Don't worry. kid.

367
00:39:37.933 --> 00:39:41.133
I've got everything under control.

368
00:39:48.166 --> 00:39:52.833
How dare you trespass
on our secret ground?

369
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.933
Your punishment will be
to feed the Tree of Knowledge.

370
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.533
That's not so bad.

371
00:40:00.166 --> 00:40:02.033
With your souls!

372
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.133
Stop! Don't hurt them.

373
00:40:09.733 --> 00:40:11.166
Why shouldn't I?

374
00:40:11.466 --> 00:40:15.900
Creatures like you are stealing our sun
and killing my Tree!

375
00:40:15.966 --> 00:40:17.133
Wait. no!

376
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.933
It tried to eat me!

377
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.333
What?

378
00:40:27.466 --> 00:40:29.066
Wait a minute.

379
00:40:29.133 --> 00:40:32.433
You're telling me you gave her a vision.

380
00:40:34.266 --> 00:40:35.366
Really?

381
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:36.900
You're unbelievable!

382
00:40:36.966 --> 00:40:39.900
If this is a bad time. we can just...

383
00:40:41.266 --> 00:40:43.700
Or we'll stay right here.
That works too.

384
00:40:44.433 --> 00:40:48.933
The all-powerful Tree of Knowledge
says you have capacity

385
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.066
for great destruction.

386
00:40:51.566 --> 00:40:53.600
You mean what happened on the Peninsula?

387
00:40:53.666 --> 00:40:56.066
No. I was trying to help!

388
00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.666
I didn't mean to.

389
00:40:58.566 --> 00:41:00.900
Wait. what's the Tree of Knowledge?

390
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.400
Hear that?

391
00:41:03.466 --> 00:41:05.466
She doesn't even know who you are.

392
00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:10.066
The Tree is connected to all things

393
00:41:10.133 --> 00:41:14.066
and can see all things.

394
00:41:14.133 --> 00:41:17.366
It knows everything that has passed

395
00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:21.100
and everything that could possibly come.

396
00:41:21.766 --> 00:41:24.600
And I wonder
why it's gotten such a big head!

397
00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:29.266
So the things I saw are real?

398
00:41:29.333 --> 00:41:30.333
No!

399
00:41:30.566 --> 00:41:32.366
Well. not literally.

400
00:41:32.866 --> 00:41:36.766
It only shows an important moment
in your future.

401
00:41:36.833 --> 00:41:39.366
A version of your path.

402
00:41:39.433 --> 00:41:41.766
It's up to you what you do with it.

403
00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:45.066
Okay. but what did it mean?

404
00:41:45.633 --> 00:41:46.933
Well I don't know!

405
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.400
It gets very cryptic when it's tired.

406
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:50.966
But none of that matters!

407
00:41:51.466 --> 00:41:54.800
You'll never escape the forest.

408
00:41:54.866 --> 00:41:58.733
The creatures here are very angry and...

409
00:42:00.666 --> 00:42:04.266
Well. you're certainly
going to a lot of trouble for this one.

410
00:42:05.866 --> 00:42:07.466
Alright!

411
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.366
You will be given safe transport

412
00:42:11.433 --> 00:42:14.966
by the Great Tempest of Leaves.

413
00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:19.000
Which apparently we can spare
for any old person now.

414
00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.600
Double standards.

415
00:42:31.533 --> 00:42:35.866
The forest warns you
to choose your path wisely.

416
00:42:35.933 --> 00:42:38.400
Very wisely.

417
00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:51.300
I hope you're right about this one.

418
00:43:07.833 --> 00:43:10.233
Hello again. Blister.

419
00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.100
Maybee.

420
00:43:14.366 --> 00:43:16.533
Twelve years is a long time to hide.

421
00:43:16.866 --> 00:43:21.166
I hope you haven't lost
your abilities in your old age.

422
00:43:25.866 --> 00:43:27.833
Keeper. bring me a citizen.

423
00:43:28.166 --> 00:43:29.400
Any citizen will do.

424
00:43:29.633 --> 00:43:32.300
I want to make sure
the transformation process is perfect

425
00:43:32.366 --> 00:43:34.533
before I run the final experiment.

426
00:43:36.633 --> 00:43:39.200
So I can finally bring her back.

427
00:43:59.766 --> 00:44:02.333
Are you doing alright?

428
00:44:02.933 --> 00:44:05.300
Not too shellshocked
after what just happened?

429
00:44:08.733 --> 00:44:10.200
Is she okay?

430
00:44:10.266 --> 00:44:11.666
Yes. of course.

431
00:44:11.866 --> 00:44:14.766
She's just not used
to flying without a seatbelt.

432
00:44:16.333 --> 00:44:17.900
Have you been friends for long?

433
00:44:17.966 --> 00:44:20.200
Pretty much forever. thankfully.

434
00:44:20.266 --> 00:44:23.600
She has this habit
of bringing out the best in me.

435
00:44:24.166 --> 00:44:27.800
And I certainly think her life
is more exciting when I'm around.

436
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.200
Don't you worry.

437
00:44:30.266 --> 00:44:33.066
We're going to find my dad
and we'll get Egg fixed up.

438
00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.400
- Is that...?
- It sure is. kid!

439
00:44:56.466 --> 00:44:58.666
The City of Light!

440
00:45:04.833 --> 00:45:06.233
Thank you!

441
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.133
We appreciate the ride!

442
00:45:15.666 --> 00:45:18.466
How are we going to get in there?

443
00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.566
Darn vent!

444
00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.566
Let me have a go.

445
00:45:27.133 --> 00:45:29.133
Now let's see.

446
00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.933
Good job. kid!

447
00:45:45.966 --> 00:45:48.900
- Only first-class travel for us.
- What?

448
00:45:48.966 --> 00:45:52.000
Everybody out of the way!

449
00:45:52.133 --> 00:45:56.166
Nothing to it but to do it!

450
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.700
Welcome to the city. kid!

451
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.833
Where anything is possible.

452
00:46:17.033 --> 00:46:19.033
It smells like garbage.

453
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.566
That's not garbage.

454
00:46:20.633 --> 00:46:23.633
That is the odor of opportunity.

455
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.900
It's the je ne sais quoi of the city.

456
00:46:25.966 --> 00:46:26.966
The...

457
00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.433
No. actually. that's just garbage.

458
00:46:30.666 --> 00:46:32.700
That smell is just rotten garbage.

459
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.366
What kind of maniac
would throw this away?

460
00:46:40.533 --> 00:46:42.133
What's out there?

461
00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.000
Kid. you can't just go
charging out there!

462
00:46:47.066 --> 00:46:48.533
It's not safe!

463
00:46:48.666 --> 00:46:51.900
We need to come up with a plan.

464
00:46:52.533 --> 00:46:54.366
Okay?

465
00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.200
Got it!

466
00:46:58.266 --> 00:47:02.700
My handy Book of Proverbs
will have all the answers.

467
00:47:04.366 --> 00:47:05.433
What do you mean?

468
00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.600
The book
is an all-powerful oracle that...

469
00:47:08.666 --> 00:47:10.533
Well. then. what do you want to do?

470
00:47:34.166 --> 00:47:36.466
It's beautiful!

471
00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.266
There's so many creatures!

472
00:47:40.833 --> 00:47:42.966
There's so many creatures.

473
00:47:43.433 --> 00:47:45.666
How will I ever find dad?

474
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.400
Good evening. my dear citizens.

475
00:47:50.766 --> 00:47:55.466
Here. in my wonderful City of Light
I strive to help you

476
00:47:55.533 --> 00:47:57.866
become the epitome of perfection.

477
00:47:57.933 --> 00:48:02.633
And today I offer you
an extraordinary opportunity.

478
00:48:03.066 --> 00:48:04.300
It's him!

479
00:48:04.666 --> 00:48:09.433
Tonight I will make someone live up
to their full potential.

480
00:48:09.833 --> 00:48:14.433
Our poor friend has spent their life
struggling with wings that can't fly.

481
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.366
legs that slow them down

482
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.500
and a fin that sends them off-course.

483
00:48:19.966 --> 00:48:23.866
But after tonight.
they will struggle no more.

484
00:48:30.666 --> 00:48:33.200
Thanks to new resources at my disposal

485
00:48:34.033 --> 00:48:38.633
I can now transform you
into who you always wanted to be.

486
00:49:08.933 --> 00:49:14.166
Don't forget. my dear friends.
I can make you magnificent.

487
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.700
- Magnificent...
- Is what I would be...

488
00:49:21.766 --> 00:49:23.500
- If I wasn't...
- Stuck...

489
00:49:23.566 --> 00:49:24.600
- With you!
- With you!

490
00:49:24.666 --> 00:49:25.733
- Get off!
- Get off!

491
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.566
- No!
- Don't touch me!

492
00:49:27.833 --> 00:49:30.733
The second I get enough money...

493
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.266
I'm paying Dr. Maybee to get you off me!

494
00:49:34.333 --> 00:49:37.066
No. I'm getting you off me!

495
00:49:38.133 --> 00:49:40.433
And you'd better not start cry...

496
00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:41.966
Look!

497
00:49:43.766 --> 00:49:45.233
- A tentacle!
- A tentacle!

498
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.100
Hello. little girl!

499
00:49:51.333 --> 00:49:52.733
Are you lost?

500
00:49:54.033 --> 00:49:57.300
No. I'm just waiting for my friends.

501
00:49:57.633 --> 00:50:00.566
Friends? We can be friends with you!

502
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.200
And with your tentacle!

503
00:50:06.766 --> 00:50:09.233
Let go of my tentacle!

504
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:13.766
Tentacle!

505
00:50:14.266 --> 00:50:15.433
Tentacle?

506
00:50:16.266 --> 00:50:17.333
Arkie!

507
00:50:21.266 --> 00:50:22.900
Is that a tentacle?

508
00:50:22.966 --> 00:50:25.366
Mind your own business! She is mine!

509
00:50:25.433 --> 00:50:27.266
Yes. mind your own business!

510
00:50:27.333 --> 00:50:29.666
Stop it! You were never a part of this!

511
00:50:29.733 --> 00:50:32.300
I've been here the whole time!

512
00:50:45.266 --> 00:50:46.900
- Excuse me!
- Get out of the way!

513
00:50:46.966 --> 00:50:48.333
Coming through! Sorry!

514
00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.533
Get back here!

515
00:50:53.066 --> 00:50:54.833
- Excuse me.
- Get out of the way.

516
00:51:01.466 --> 00:51:02.766
Arkie!

517
00:51:02.833 --> 00:51:04.700
Over here. kid!

518
00:51:04.766 --> 00:51:06.700
Come down. little girl.

519
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.700
We don't bite.

520
00:51:28.566 --> 00:51:29.566
Arkie!

521
00:51:36.133 --> 00:51:37.566
Thanks. Bunni.

522
00:51:55.633 --> 00:51:58.300
Egg. we can't keep hiding her.

523
00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.366
We need to do this.

524
00:52:05.166 --> 00:52:06.500
What was that?

525
00:52:06.766 --> 00:52:09.200
Why did they keep talking
about my tentacle?

526
00:52:10.266 --> 00:52:12.600
Well. who knows
why anyone does anything?

527
00:52:14.033 --> 00:52:15.933
Bunniguru. what aren't you telling me?

528
00:52:18.866 --> 00:52:21.900
The thing is. kid. tentacles are...

529
00:52:23.166 --> 00:52:25.033
They are rare.

530
00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.400
They have a kind of bounty on them
in the city.

531
00:52:28.733 --> 00:52:30.866
Bounty? Why?

532
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.400
People will pay big rewards for them.

533
00:52:34.766 --> 00:52:37.133
And when you live
in a place like this...

534
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.566
you do stuff you're not proud of.

535
00:52:52.366 --> 00:52:55.833
What did you say you were looking for
on the Peninsula again?

536
00:52:59.066 --> 00:53:01.233
Kid. the truth is...

537
00:53:03.266 --> 00:53:04.300
Egg!

538
00:53:04.766 --> 00:53:05.900
Egg?

539
00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:24.400
I'm going to find Egg some help
so just stay here

540
00:53:24.466 --> 00:53:25.966
and look after her. okay?

541
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.000
Bunniguru?

542
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.133
You're going to ask
about my dad too. right?

543
00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:38.366
Sure.

544
00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.133
Sure. kid.

545
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.133
Where are you. Chihoohoo?

546
00:54:10.466 --> 00:54:12.800
Otto. give me another onion sour.

547
00:54:13.766 --> 00:54:16.633
Okay. let's get this over with.

548
00:54:17.233 --> 00:54:18.600
Boss!

549
00:54:19.166 --> 00:54:21.833
I found another two Squigglers
stashed out the back.

550
00:54:23.066 --> 00:54:26.133
I wonder what she does
with all these Squigglers.

551
00:54:26.966 --> 00:54:30.800
I reckon she chops their tentacles up
and throws them in a stew.

552
00:54:32.233 --> 00:54:34.200
Fries them in butter!

553
00:54:34.833 --> 00:54:39.266
- With a little bit of sage!
- And a pop of lemon!

554
00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.733
What am I doing?

555
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.500
I can't do this to Arkie.

556
00:54:46.866 --> 00:54:48.333
I have to get her out of the city.

557
00:54:50.333 --> 00:54:53.533
Arkie! What are you doing here?

558
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.800
Look. I just want to find out
where my dad is.

559
00:54:57.366 --> 00:55:01.366
I know where to find him.
You just have to be quiet.

560
00:55:01.433 --> 00:55:03.633
- Come on!
- You know where he is?

561
00:55:06.433 --> 00:55:08.066
Quick! This way!

562
00:55:12.566 --> 00:55:13.566
Egg!

563
00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:26.333
Eat some greens. River Bandit.

564
00:55:27.133 --> 00:55:29.733
This time it wasn't me. boss.

565
00:55:34.466 --> 00:55:35.566
Tentacle!

566
00:55:35.633 --> 00:55:37.600
Tentacle.

567
00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.166
Bunniguru.

568
00:55:40.966 --> 00:55:43.000
We need to get Arkie out of here!

569
00:55:43.066 --> 00:55:44.766
Bunni. what's going on?

570
00:55:45.266 --> 00:55:46.900
Get me that girl!

571
00:55:48.566 --> 00:55:49.866
Could you make it upstairs?

572
00:55:53.633 --> 00:55:56.533
Chihoohoo. over here. you mutts!

573
00:55:59.566 --> 00:56:00.800
Tentacle!

574
00:56:02.333 --> 00:56:03.366
Spread out!

575
00:56:03.433 --> 00:56:04.933
Don't let the bounty escape.

576
00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.700
Coming for you.

577
00:56:10.466 --> 00:56:14.833
If ever there was a moment
for some good advice it would be now.

578
00:56:20.266 --> 00:56:22.333
Bunniguru.

579
00:56:24.066 --> 00:56:27.833
Looks like you brought me back
a little souvenir from the Peninsula.

580
00:56:29.066 --> 00:56:30.533
I don't know what you mean.

581
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.233
Bunni. don't be like that.

582
00:56:36.633 --> 00:56:38.833
Tell me. who's the girl?

583
00:56:42.266 --> 00:56:44.233
She's not for sale.

584
00:56:44.833 --> 00:56:46.866
You haven't even heard my offer.

585
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.800
But she's really not worth anything.

586
00:56:50.066 --> 00:56:52.300
She's defective and doesn't floss.

587
00:56:54.466 --> 00:56:56.733
Don't be cute. Bunniguru.

588
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.200
You owe me a lot of money.

589
00:56:59.666 --> 00:57:02.133
And you also
need to stop your little friend

590
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.666
from coughing up sulphur
before it gets worse.

591
00:57:05.733 --> 00:57:09.233
You wouldn't want her
to get worse. would you?

592
00:57:13.066 --> 00:57:15.733
So. what's it going to be?

593
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.366
Hang in there. Egg.

594
00:57:38.633 --> 00:57:41.700
Bunniguru. what happened down there?

595
00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:45.833
Bunni?

596
00:57:51.566 --> 00:57:53.233
Are these your friends?

597
00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.733
Friends?

598
00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:57.000
Yes.

599
00:57:57.066 --> 00:57:59.333
We're real good friends now.

600
00:57:59.466 --> 00:58:01.266
Aren't we. rabbit?

601
00:58:03.133 --> 00:58:04.566
Get me the merchandise.

602
00:58:05.966 --> 00:58:07.700
Bunniguru. what's happening?

603
00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:17.133
Come here. little girl!

604
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.300
Let me go!

605
00:58:24.633 --> 00:58:25.800
Egg!

606
00:58:33.833 --> 00:58:35.133
Egg!

607
00:58:41.366 --> 00:58:43.066
Chihoohoo. wait!

608
00:58:43.133 --> 00:58:44.300
The reward?

609
00:58:45.366 --> 00:58:48.866
I reckon she's just about worth
what you owe me.

610
00:58:49.333 --> 00:58:50.766
No. you can't!

611
00:58:51.266 --> 00:58:53.433
We need that money to fix Egg!

612
00:58:54.066 --> 00:58:55.866
Wait. no. stop. please!

613
00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.133
Chihoohoo. come back!

614
00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.633
Chihoohoo!

615
00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:03.233
Come back!

616
00:59:06.466 --> 00:59:07.800
What have I done?

617
00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:22.333
Keeper. I've got
a very special surprise for you.

618
00:59:22.966 --> 00:59:25.333
I don't need any more Squigglers.

619
00:59:25.533 --> 00:59:28.566
Do you really think
I'd bring you a little Squiggler

620
00:59:28.633 --> 00:59:30.200
after the haul I just brought in?

621
00:59:30.666 --> 00:59:33.500
Trust me. you are going to want this.

622
00:59:35.733 --> 00:59:37.366
You showed her. boss!

623
00:59:39.033 --> 00:59:40.400
Somebody!

624
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.600
Let me out!

625
00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:46.500
Let me out!

626
01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:04.900
Doctor Maybee?

627
01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.733
Conforming new energy source.

628
01:00:10.966 --> 01:00:12.733
Optimum energy levels reached.

629
01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:14.400
It's working!

630
01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:18.400
You could run this machine
for fifty years

631
01:00:18.466 --> 01:00:20.600
and never come up with her DNA.

632
01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:22.800
You're draining the sun for nothing!

633
01:00:22.866 --> 01:00:24.333
It's not for nothing.

634
01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.633
she's the most important thing
in the world!

635
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.833
You have no idea what it's been like.

636
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.866
Your daughter is gone.

637
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.300
You took her from me.

638
01:00:34.366 --> 01:00:36.400
What happened to her wasn't my fault!

639
01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.800
It was an accident!

640
01:00:37.866 --> 01:00:40.433
If you hadn't fought me
it never would have happened!

641
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.000
You attacked me!

642
01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.166
Your recklessness killed her.

643
01:00:44.233 --> 01:00:48.000
What kind of father acts like that
when he has a child to care for?

644
01:00:48.066 --> 01:00:51.166
Well. you could never understand
what it takes to be a real father.

645
01:00:51.233 --> 01:00:53.466
You're far too selfish.

646
01:00:53.533 --> 01:00:57.000
I've been a more loving father to her
than you ever could have been.

647
01:00:57.766 --> 01:00:58.800
What?

648
01:01:00.533 --> 01:01:02.233
Incoming transmission.

649
01:01:02.433 --> 01:01:04.433
- Doctor Maybee.
- What?

650
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.633
Look!

651
01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:13.866
Arkie!

652
01:01:14.366 --> 01:01:15.600
It can't be.

653
01:01:16.233 --> 01:01:17.366
No!

654
01:01:17.433 --> 01:01:19.333
Wait for me at the landing dock.

655
01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.700
Be sure nothing happens to her.
do you understand?

656
01:01:26.333 --> 01:01:27.400
No!

657
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.733
Blister. all these years you had her.

658
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.600
What are you going to do with her?

659
01:01:37.266 --> 01:01:38.766
Maybee. no!

660
01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:41.966
Please. leave her alone!

661
01:02:24.433 --> 01:02:25.933
It's really you!

662
01:02:26.033 --> 01:02:27.700
Doctor Maybee?

663
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.833
What am I doing here?

664
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.600
It's alright.

665
01:02:33.033 --> 01:02:34.633
You don't need to be scared.

666
01:02:35.333 --> 01:02:37.600
I believe you are looking
for your father.

667
01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.866
But my dad is here?

668
01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:44.666
Come. I'll take you to him.

669
01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:48.800
But there's something
I need to show you first.

670
01:03:16.666 --> 01:03:20.200
This is my gallery of memories.

671
01:03:21.033 --> 01:03:24.800
Moments from my past preserved forever.

672
01:03:26.266 --> 01:03:29.333
I used to spend a lot of time in here
trying to figure out

673
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.866
how to get my daughter back.

674
01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:32.866
You had a daughter?

675
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.733
I did.

676
01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.933
Why does she look so much like me?

677
01:03:41.466 --> 01:03:45.300
Well. in a way. she is you.

678
01:03:46.466 --> 01:03:47.866
Arkie.

679
01:03:47.933 --> 01:03:49.866
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.

680
01:03:49.933 --> 01:03:53.300
but Blister hasn't been honest with you

681
01:03:53.366 --> 01:03:55.833
about something truly important.

682
01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:58.066
He's not your father.

683
01:03:59.566 --> 01:04:01.066
I am.

684
01:04:02.133 --> 01:04:03.133
Wait.

685
01:04:03.533 --> 01:04:05.033
What do you mean?

686
01:04:06.033 --> 01:04:09.366
Many years ago
my daughter and I were forced

687
01:04:09.433 --> 01:04:12.233
to flee our home as our world
was destroyed.

688
01:04:15.266 --> 01:04:17.433
We were the only humans left
in the galaxy.

689
01:04:21.233 --> 01:04:24.533
Fearing for humanity's survival
I headed to a planet

690
01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.666
I'd heard incredible stories about.

691
01:04:27.266 --> 01:04:28.333
This planet.

692
01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:33.266
Legend told of an octopus
with regenerative properties

693
01:04:33.333 --> 01:04:34.966
named Blister.

694
01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:40.233
I knew if I could find him.

695
01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:44.266
he would be able to help me
bring back the human race.

696
01:04:46.666 --> 01:04:48.566
But when I finally found him...

697
01:04:50.266 --> 01:04:51.333
He attacked us!

698
01:04:51.866 --> 01:04:54.166
Killing my daughter. my Arkie.

699
01:04:56.466 --> 01:04:57.800
No!

700
01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:08.633
The only way of getting back my daughter
was to gather as much of her DNA

701
01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.166
as I could and try to recreate her.

702
01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.366
And by harnessing the power of the sun

703
01:05:21.666 --> 01:05:22.733
I did it.

704
01:05:34.166 --> 01:05:37.033
I created you.

705
01:05:39.466 --> 01:05:42.400
But then.
before I had a chance to perfect you.

706
01:05:44.033 --> 01:05:45.900
fate took you from me again.

707
01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.566
Blister never told me
that he'd found you.

708
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.966
I didn't even think
you were still alive!

709
01:05:59.766 --> 01:06:01.166
Until now.

710
01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.533
Why wouldn't dad tell me any of this?

711
01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.166
It doesn't make any sense! I can't be...

712
01:06:08.233 --> 01:06:09.800
You are human. Arkie.

713
01:06:09.933 --> 01:06:12.100
And you belong here.

714
01:06:12.233 --> 01:06:13.866
But my tentacle...

715
01:06:13.933 --> 01:06:16.966
I'm afraid my technology
wasn't as good as it is today

716
01:06:17.633 --> 01:06:20.366
and it malfunctioned.

717
01:06:20.433 --> 01:06:21.866
Where is my dad?

718
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.633
I need to talk to him.

719
01:06:24.133 --> 01:06:26.433
I'll take you to my lab and show you.

720
01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.900
Subject vitals low.

721
01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:45.566
What is all this?

722
01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:50.166
This is where I run my experiments
and fix the citizens.

723
01:06:50.766 --> 01:06:53.500
Wait. My dad's here?

724
01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.133
He'll be up in a minute.

725
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.600
But I think we should fix you up first.

726
01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.233
Don't you think?

727
01:07:00.366 --> 01:07:02.633
Fix me? How?

728
01:07:03.866 --> 01:07:06.366
Are you going to make
my tentacle heal things?

729
01:07:09.333 --> 01:07:10.933
No. don't be ridiculous.

730
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.166
I'm not going to let you
keep that thing.

731
01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.066
I'm going to make you flawless.

732
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.333
- You want to change me?
- Of course!

733
01:07:19.866 --> 01:07:21.933
You saw what my daughter looked like.

734
01:07:22.233 --> 01:07:24.333
You're nowhere near
as perfect as she was.

735
01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:28.633
- Not yet.
- I can't just get rid of my tentacle.

736
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.800
You don't have a choice.

737
01:07:33.166 --> 01:07:35.000
No! I don't want to!

738
01:07:35.766 --> 01:07:36.800
Dad?

739
01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.633
- Dad!
- Maybee.

740
01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:42.533
When are you going to understand
that he's not your father?

741
01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.900
We have to get rid of every mutation
he's responsible for.

742
01:07:45.966 --> 01:07:47.900
You have to be perfect!

743
01:07:47.966 --> 01:07:49.833
I want to talk to my dad.

744
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.900
Where is he?

745
01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.133
You want to see him? Fine.

746
01:08:05.433 --> 01:08:06.900
Dad!

747
01:08:08.733 --> 01:08:10.133
Let him out!

748
01:08:10.533 --> 01:08:12.533
Enough of this. Keeper!

749
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.333
Put her in the machine.

750
01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.866
Please. I don't want to change.

751
01:08:17.133 --> 01:08:20.033
Dad! Dad. wake up!

752
01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.200
Dad!

753
01:08:21.266 --> 01:08:22.366
Arkie?

754
01:08:22.433 --> 01:08:24.366
Get her inside the pod!

755
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.966
Don't let him do this!

756
01:08:32.133 --> 01:08:33.300
No.

757
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.733
What did you say to me?

758
01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.866
I'm not helping you harm her.

759
01:08:39.433 --> 01:08:42.200
I'm not helping you harm anyone anymore.

760
01:08:42.633 --> 01:08:46.700
Think very carefully
about what you're doing right now.

761
01:08:47.066 --> 01:08:48.400
Cover your eyes!

762
01:08:55.666 --> 01:08:58.200
Run. Arkie! Run!

763
01:08:58.266 --> 01:08:59.333
Dad!

764
01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:00.800
Keeper!

765
01:09:03.866 --> 01:09:05.566
Let me go!

766
01:09:05.666 --> 01:09:07.366
I have to go back for him!

767
01:09:07.433 --> 01:09:08.466
Listen to me.

768
01:09:08.533 --> 01:09:10.866
Maybee would have stopped at nothing
to transform you

769
01:09:10.933 --> 01:09:12.266
and drained Blister to do it.

770
01:09:12.333 --> 01:09:14.400
We have to get you away from here.

771
01:09:14.466 --> 01:09:16.600
So quickly. follow me!

772
01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.133
Welcome to the Bower.

773
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.866
Why are you helping me?

774
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.966
You shouldn't have to change for Maybee.

775
01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.433
No one should.

776
01:10:16.633 --> 01:10:18.233
Are you...

777
01:10:19.166 --> 01:10:20.200
Part Squiggler.

778
01:10:21.033 --> 01:10:23.400
I was one
of Dr. Maybee's early experiments.

779
01:10:23.833 --> 01:10:26.133
I wanted to help him create life.

780
01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.600
I thought his technology
was groundbreaking.

781
01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.833
But then I realized what we were doing
to the Squigglers was cruel.

782
01:10:33.733 --> 01:10:35.233
Why didn't you leave?

783
01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:38.600
It would have meant leaving them
helpless and hunted by Maybee.

784
01:10:38.666 --> 01:10:42.266
So I started hiding them down here
and helping them regain their strength.

785
01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.933
How could Dr. Maybee think
it was okay to hurt them?

786
01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:52.700
Doctor Maybee is prepared to do anything
to create his perfect daughter.

787
01:10:53.266 --> 01:10:55.600
He doesn't care about the planet
or the citizens.

788
01:10:57.466 --> 01:10:59.433
Or me. Right?

789
01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:01.933
No.

790
01:11:02.666 --> 01:11:05.333
He's become so consumed
by his need for perfection

791
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.166
I don't think he's capable
of loving anyone anymore.

792
01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:12.400
Now my dad is stuck up there with him.

793
01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:15.833
What can we do?

794
01:11:25.166 --> 01:11:27.766
Warning. Sun core unstable.

795
01:11:27.833 --> 01:11:32.000
Maybee. stop this pointless destruction.

796
01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:35.700
Can't you see that you are never
going to get your daughter back?

797
01:11:36.366 --> 01:11:37.800
She's gone!

798
01:11:41.133 --> 01:11:43.733
Actually. you old octopus.

799
01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.166
thanks to you and your Arkie.

800
01:11:46.966 --> 01:11:49.733
I'm closer to getting her back
than I ever was before.

801
01:12:04.333 --> 01:12:06.500
Analyzing organic matter.

802
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.000
Arkie DNA found.

803
01:12:09.066 --> 01:12:10.600
This is madness!

804
01:12:10.666 --> 01:12:12.400
The sun won't be able to take it!

805
01:12:12.466 --> 01:12:13.666
You'll kill us all!

806
01:12:13.733 --> 01:12:16.066
Wouldn't you do the same thing for Arkie

807
01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:18.333
if it was the only way?

808
01:12:28.366 --> 01:12:30.966
Final genome trials ready for launch.

809
01:12:55.433 --> 01:12:57.333
Where's that noise coming from?

810
01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.300
Maybee must have activated the beam.

811
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.733
Dad!

812
01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.766
We have to go back and help him!

813
01:13:02.833 --> 01:13:05.566
We will but it's not safe
to leave the Bower.

814
01:13:05.633 --> 01:13:08.000
We have to wait
for the machine to stop first.

815
01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.466
Arkie?

816
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.966
What have I done?

817
01:13:21.366 --> 01:13:23.966
We sold Arkie out for nothing!

818
01:13:26.233 --> 01:13:28.500
Perhaps the oracle has something to say.

819
01:13:29.733 --> 01:13:34.000
"Be wary of the weatherman
who refuses to look up".

820
01:13:36.933 --> 01:13:38.966
What a bunch of nonsense!

821
01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:43.433
How are we going
to get out of this mess?

822
01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.866
Just let me wallow in peace. Egg.

823
01:14:00.733 --> 01:14:02.366
Sun core unstable.

824
01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:05.466
Genome reconstruction requires
additional power.

825
01:14:06.866 --> 01:14:08.633
It's taking too long.

826
01:14:12.066 --> 01:14:16.000
Solar power increased.
Resuming life form reconstruction.

827
01:14:16.066 --> 01:14:17.366
Doctor Maybee!

828
01:14:20.466 --> 01:14:23.000
Well. this is a surprise.

829
01:14:27.466 --> 01:14:29.400
You need to stop this!

830
01:14:29.466 --> 01:14:31.700
If you promise to let Blister go.

831
01:14:31.966 --> 01:14:34.200
you can change me however you want.

832
01:14:35.033 --> 01:14:38.166
Well. after your little outburst
I realized

833
01:14:38.233 --> 01:14:41.533
that even if I were to fix you
you'd still be nothing

834
01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.866
like my beautiful little girl.

835
01:14:44.366 --> 01:14:48.366
But with your DNA
I can recreate her from scratch

836
01:14:48.433 --> 01:14:50.033
exactly how she should be.

837
01:14:50.833 --> 01:14:52.766
You have nothing left to offer me.

838
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:56.800
Whatever you create in there
it still won't be

839
01:14:56.866 --> 01:14:58.266
the daughter you remember.

840
01:14:58.333 --> 01:15:00.866
You don't know
what you're talking about.

841
01:15:00.933 --> 01:15:02.433
She was unique!

842
01:15:02.933 --> 01:15:05.366
There was more to her
than just how she looked.

843
01:15:05.866 --> 01:15:10.000
And what you're doing
is hurting my dad and killing the sun.

844
01:15:10.633 --> 01:15:13.433
She's the only thing that matters.

845
01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.933
Please!

846
01:15:15.533 --> 01:15:17.166
I can't lose him.

847
01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:50.500
I think we missed the landing bay
by just a smidge.

848
01:15:51.433 --> 01:15:52.733
Bunni?

849
01:15:52.833 --> 01:15:53.900
Egg!

850
01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:55.933
Quick! Give me a hand.

851
01:16:05.633 --> 01:16:07.066
Kid. let us help.

852
01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.933
Dad?

853
01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.533
- Dad!
- Arkie!

854
01:16:16.266 --> 01:16:18.600
I'm so sorry
I didn't tell you the truth.

855
01:16:19.066 --> 01:16:21.166
Dad. it's okay.

856
01:16:21.466 --> 01:16:23.266
I'm just glad you're alright.

857
01:16:32.533 --> 01:16:35.133
Life form reconstruction failed.

858
01:16:35.733 --> 01:16:38.233
Life form reconstruction failed.

859
01:16:38.866 --> 01:16:41.300
Life form reconstruction failed.

860
01:16:45.866 --> 01:16:47.666
Crystal re-engaged.

861
01:16:47.733 --> 01:16:50.000
Sun core meltdown imminent.

862
01:16:50.066 --> 01:16:54.833
Blister. why do you always take
everything from me?

863
01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:58.600
No!

864
01:16:58.666 --> 01:17:01.500
Warning. System critical failure.

865
01:17:05.933 --> 01:17:07.700
Now we're even.

866
01:17:10.333 --> 01:17:12.766
- Maybee!
- Dad. wait!

867
01:17:12.833 --> 01:17:15.166
But he'll get away. We have to stop him.

868
01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.833
No. we don't.

869
01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:19.366
We have to stop the beam
from destroying the sun.

870
01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:23.166
But. how?

871
01:17:23.866 --> 01:17:26.000
Warning. crystal overload.

872
01:17:26.066 --> 01:17:27.966
Evacuate.

873
01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.366
Warning. crystal overload.

874
01:17:30.433 --> 01:17:32.300
Okay. follow me.

875
01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:54.833
Maybee!

876
01:17:57.166 --> 01:18:00.366
You don't get to destroy this world
and simply run away.

877
01:18:03.266 --> 01:18:04.833
Goodbye. Keeper.

878
01:18:19.566 --> 01:18:20.633
Wait.

879
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.133
Stay back.

880
01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.566
Get away from me!

881
01:18:26.633 --> 01:18:29.433
You have to answer
for everything you've done.

882
01:18:29.666 --> 01:18:31.866
especially to them.

883
01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.500
No!

884
01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.433
No!

885
01:18:59.833 --> 01:19:01.300
What have you done?

886
01:19:02.066 --> 01:19:04.400
Emergency procedure initiated.

887
01:19:05.433 --> 01:19:06.633
No!

888
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.966
Alright. what are you thinking. kiddo?

889
01:19:24.033 --> 01:19:27.600
- I have a plan but I need your help.
- What can we do?

890
01:19:31.766 --> 01:19:34.400
Okay. everyone get to a mirror.

891
01:19:34.866 --> 01:19:37.766
When I give the signal.
aim at the crystal.

892
01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:43.200
I need you to throw me to the center.

893
01:19:43.566 --> 01:19:47.900
- Arkie. I can't just throw you.
- Dad. I know what I'm doing.

894
01:19:48.466 --> 01:19:49.833
Trust me.

895
01:19:51.133 --> 01:19:52.700
Go get them. kiddo.

896
01:20:08.133 --> 01:20:09.700
Glad I stuck that landing.

897
01:20:22.766 --> 01:20:25.566
Nothing to it but to do it.

898
01:20:37.066 --> 01:20:38.066
Now!

899
01:20:50.433 --> 01:20:52.533
Keep holding!

900
01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.666
That's it!

901
01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:21.300
We're alive!

902
01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:24.800
Get off me!

903
01:21:24.866 --> 01:21:27.033
You're messing up my moustache!

904
01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:31.966
Arkie?

905
01:21:32.533 --> 01:21:33.600
Dad!

906
01:21:38.066 --> 01:21:39.800
That was amazing!

907
01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:42.033
I'm so proud of you.

908
01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:43.866
Thanks. Dad.

909
01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:45.600
Arkie!

910
01:21:47.933 --> 01:21:52.166
Dad. I'd like you to meet
two very special friends of mine.

911
01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.766
Bunniguru and Egg.

912
01:21:55.266 --> 01:21:56.966
Mister Blister.

913
01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:00.700
- It's a pleasure.
- Likewise.

914
01:22:03.566 --> 01:22:05.600
That's a nasty crack you've got there.

915
01:22:07.233 --> 01:22:09.266
Dad. do you think...?

916
01:22:11.533 --> 01:22:13.766
Ready to see what an octopus
can really do?

917
01:22:41.966 --> 01:22:43.233
Egg!

918
01:22:48.066 --> 01:22:49.066
Wait.

919
01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:51.866
Here you go.

920
01:22:54.766 --> 01:22:56.633
Good as new.

921
01:23:01.766 --> 01:23:03.666
Thank you. Arkie.

922
01:23:35.733 --> 01:23:37.833
This is living. Egg.

923
01:23:39.033 --> 01:23:41.933
I wonder what the oracle
would say in this occasion.

924
01:23:46.466 --> 01:23:48.133
Why would you do that?

925
01:23:52.766 --> 01:23:53.766
You're right.

926
01:23:54.233 --> 01:23:58.233
Sometimes it's best
to just enjoy the moment.

927
01:24:05.233 --> 01:24:08.300
Now. I think I've got this.

928
01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:13.633
Is this right?

929
01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.133
What are you doing?

930
01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.966
Why are you shaking it?

931
01:24:18.366 --> 01:24:22.033
- Stop. okay? Stop.
- Be nice to your old dad.

932
01:24:22.733 --> 01:24:25.500
Alright. what do I actually need to do?

933
01:24:26.133 --> 01:24:29.366
You just do your reviving thing
and I'll do the rest.

934
01:24:36.633 --> 01:24:38.000
Here we go!

935
01:24:48.633 --> 01:24:51.700
So what machine should we build next?

936
01:24:52.166 --> 01:24:55.433
Well. there's always
something you can do.

937
01:24:56.066 --> 01:24:58.800
And I've got a few ideas.

938
01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.600
I hate it when you're right.
