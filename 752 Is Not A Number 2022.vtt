3
00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.035
<i>America martyred our commander.</i>

4
00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.750
Death to America!

5
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.574
<i>After threats from the President
and military</i>

6
00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.659
<i>of the criminal state of America</i>

7
00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:01.288
<i>to attack many targets in Iranian territory</i>

8
00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:03.707
<i>in case we retaliate.</i>

9
00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.835
<i>our armed forces
are ready to respond.</i>

10
00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:16.423
<i>The region is at heading 320.</i>

11
00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.175
<i>Is it an active region?</i>

12
00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.685
<i>There are lights.</i>

13
00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:36.276
<i>At heading 320?</i>

14
00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:43.992
<i>I can't tell. but it seems west.</i>

15
00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:52.376
<i>What kind of a light is it?</i>

16
00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.464
<i>It is a missile.</i>

17
00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:07.182
<i>How many miles? Where?</i>

18
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.316
Oh my lord. what was that?

19
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.610
What is that. Mahdi?

20
00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:24.074
They attacked somewhere.

21
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.670
What were you doing that day?

22
00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:23.884
It is difficult to talk
about it. but I will try.

23
00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.805
Some parts I will. some I may not.

24
00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:33.519
The day before. I cleaned up the house.

25
00:06:33.644 --> 00:06:37.814
It was a work day.
but I cleaned the house.

26
00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.652
I was cleaning the bathroom.

27
00:06:44.363 --> 00:06:48.492
It is impossible for me to talk about that day.

28
00:07:28.574 --> 00:07:31.118
I got on the airplane.

29
00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:34.288
Many passengers recognized me.

30
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.749
We embraced. Even the passengers.

31
00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:41.670
I saw Javad and Alireza for the first time.

32
00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.089
Saloome...

33
00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:46.508
and Amir.

34
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.970
The four of us combined...

35
00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:52.931
No. there were five of us.

36
00:07:58.437 --> 00:08:00.355
We had lost ten people.

37
00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:57.996
Certainly no missile has hit it.
But we must investigate the reason.

38
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.764
When we arrived
at the Iranian border.

39
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:19.518
there were media reports that
the plane was shot down.

40
00:09:55.304 --> 00:09:56.722
I went to the rear of the airplane.

41
00:09:56.847 --> 00:09:58.515
to get some water.

42
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.685
Three men stood up on my way back.

43
00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:09.776
They said.
"When you arrive in Iran...

44
00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:13.071
there will be TV cameras.

45
00:10:13.197 --> 00:10:15.449
The situation will be tense."

46
00:10:15.574 --> 00:10:19.119
I told them I don't care
and won't talk to them.

47
00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.837
We took the Firooz Kooh Road.

48
00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.756
Parisa loved that road.

49
00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:34.718
I couldn't see the mountains and forests anymore.

50
00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:08.710
I only remember the screams.

51
00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:12.506
Everyone was screaming.
"I miss them."

52
00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:27.771
I raised my child so she would love Iran.

53
00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:32.276
To feel she belongs to that country.

54
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:34.486
She was proud of being born
in Tehran.

55
00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:40.158
She said she is an Iranian-Canadian.

56
00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:51.461
It is difficult to spell.

57
00:11:51.587 --> 00:11:54.298
The wolf bites?

58
00:11:54.423 --> 00:11:57.718
Or the Fox is black. Is that hard?

59
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.180
Yes. it is very hard.

60
00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.309
You hanger-on!

61
00:12:06.268 --> 00:12:07.895
Bye-bye.

62
00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:22.326
My friends suggested to bury the girls in Iran.

63
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:26.371
My friend asked if I would bring them back.

64
00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:29.124
So he can say goodbye.

65
00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:32.503
I said no.

66
00:12:35.172 --> 00:12:37.883
The thought of it is maddening.

67
00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:42.054
We were not in a position to decide.

68
00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:44.890
Or where they will rest in peace.

69
00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:48.227
Someone who loves life can't rest in peace.

70
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:59.905
We hadn't even discussed these things.

71
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:04.326
Maybe we had. I can't remember.

72
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:08.205
It was an hour before I heard

73
00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:14.044
the Islamic Republic admitted they shot the plane.

74
00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:32.229
It appears there was a communications breakdown.

75
00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:34.690
Either due to jamming.

76
00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:37.609
or the network was busy.

77
00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.903
He was unable to communicate.

78
00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.948
He had ten seconds to decide.

79
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:48.829
He could fire or not.

80
00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:19.443
A thought flashed in my mind like lightning.

81
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.237
If we bury them here.

82
00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.364
they will be labelled
as martyrs.

83
00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.992
Bury them where they want.

84
00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:30.370
They will be present with their TV cameras.

85
00:14:31.163 --> 00:14:35.667
Death to the US!

86
00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:40.088
At that moment. we decided to bring them back.

87
00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:43.467
It became my mission.

88
00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:47.054
It helped me to survive those two weeks in Iran.

89
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.933
It became my reason to live.

90
00:14:51.058 --> 00:14:53.393
Later. it became a fight for justice.

91
00:15:10.786 --> 00:15:14.248
My dear Parisa. I fought hard.

92
00:15:14.373 --> 00:15:17.584
With tearful eyes. a broken heart.
I fought for you.

93
00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:20.921
I wandered the hallways of
their hellish foreign ministry.

94
00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:24.591
I wandered in their wretched morgues.

95
00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:28.387
I pleaded with everyone in that pigsty.

96
00:15:28.512 --> 00:15:30.389
To bring you and Reera back.

97
00:15:30.514 --> 00:15:33.892
To remove every obstacle in my way
and bring you home.

98
00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:39.606
I feared that they would try to stop me.

99
00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:42.484
They might arrest me or the other families.

100
00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:44.486
They murdered and now oppress like always.

101
00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:47.948
Some anonymous people
were watching.

102
00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:50.075
There was so much fear.

103
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.080
Everyone was worried
my plan would be discovered.

104
00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:01.128
I got a call around 5:00 AM.

105
00:16:01.253 --> 00:16:03.463
The Canadian team arrived in Iran.

106
00:16:03.589 --> 00:16:05.591
They told me that they were in Tehran.

107
00:16:05.716 --> 00:16:07.551
We arranged to meet them
at 5:00 PM.

108
00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:10.554
We talked about the meeting location.

109
00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:13.390
They suggested to meet near Pars hospital.

110
00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:15.517
They asked if I knew where it was.

111
00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:17.769
Reera was born there.

112
00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:26.111
I met them at 5:00 PM in front
of the hospital.

113
00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:31.033
where we waited for Reera's birth.

114
00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:35.245
We sat in a cafeteria nearby.

115
00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:39.958
I asked for three things.

116
00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:45.422
First. Parisa and Reera
must be returned to Toronto.

117
00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:48.592
Second. I needed help with my family.

118
00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:50.969
Most of them had visas.

119
00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:55.599
My brother and Parisa's brother didn't.

120
00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:58.060
I asked for visas for both of their families.

121
00:16:58.185 --> 00:17:00.020
So they could attend the burial ceremony.

122
00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:05.317
And my safety so I can do this.

123
00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:09.320
They agreed to the first two.

124
00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.031
But advised me to lay low.

125
00:17:13.492 --> 00:17:15.452
That became my mission.

126
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:20.123
I kept contact with the Canadian government.

127
00:17:20.249 --> 00:17:22.542
They told me to hide myself.

128
00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:24.877
I should stay home and they will help me.

129
00:17:25.546 --> 00:17:30.259
The family held a memorial in Sari. They had to.

130
00:17:30.384 --> 00:17:32.052
That was also being watched.

131
00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:33.720
It was like martial law.

132
00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:35.848
There were agents across the street.

133
00:17:35.973 --> 00:17:38.058
It was at the smallest mosque in Sari.

134
00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.768
I did not attend.

135
00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:46.275
When the victim ID list was released.

136
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.903
Parisa and Reera were not among the first fifty.

137
00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:52.072
I was very sad.

138
00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:56.034
The first 50 must have been easier to identify.

139
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.208
The day we went to
the coroner's office.

140
00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:12.217
We found the place.

141
00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:15.888
When we entered. the guard was rude.

142
00:18:16.013 --> 00:18:20.267
"Is it the airplane? Go inside."

143
00:18:23.562 --> 00:18:25.772
There was a commotion inside.

144
00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:31.069
Dozens of people were crying.

145
00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:35.073
I waited for the judge.

146
00:18:35.199 --> 00:18:37.492
It took half an hour for this judge...

147
00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:41.622
...to grant us an audience!

148
00:18:43.457 --> 00:18:48.420
There was a large table in front of him

149
00:18:49.046 --> 00:18:53.175
covered in fruits and sweets.

150
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.471
Like a sultan's court.

151
00:18:59.306 --> 00:19:05.896
Drinks. tea. A feast for his honour!

152
00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:11.568
I sat across his desk like a peasant.

153
00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:16.073
You have to accept your position

154
00:19:16.782 --> 00:19:19.868
once you enter this establishment.

155
00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:26.708
I said I am taking them to Toronto.

156
00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:29.711
"Oh yeah! To Toronto?" he said.

157
00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:31.421
"Alright."

158
00:19:32.256 --> 00:19:35.092
As he was talking to me.

159
00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:40.180
his finger was in his mouth
dislodging food!

160
00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:44.184
A woman began to protest.

161
00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:47.688
Her family calmed her.
The officials remained quiet.

162
00:19:47.813 --> 00:19:51.608
They knew how guilty they were.

163
00:20:11.128 --> 00:20:16.258
DEATH TO THE LIAR

164
00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:22.598
I speak as a mourning family in grief.

165
00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:27.394
As people who are like the walking dead.

166
00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:32.733
I hold out my chest.

167
00:20:32.858 --> 00:20:36.528
And plead to be arrested here.

168
00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:39.907
Execute me right here.

169
00:20:40.032 --> 00:20:43.035
After my child. I want no life.

170
00:20:54.588 --> 00:20:58.884
I sensed that another country far away...

171
00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:03.096
was mourning this loss together with us.

172
00:21:09.603 --> 00:21:12.773
And this was giving me hope.

173
00:21:12.898 --> 00:21:17.861
That I can pursue justice...
when I return to Canada.

174
00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:52.896
Madam. don't film.

175
00:22:15.002 --> 00:22:18.714
I wanted to go to the Canadian delegate's hotel.

176
00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:22.509
Stay with them even in the hallways.

177
00:22:22.634 --> 00:22:26.597
To be with Parisa and Reera on the same plane

178
00:22:26.722 --> 00:22:29.641
because they will not allow
the transport.

179
00:22:49.745 --> 00:22:52.998
We arrived in Toronto.

180
00:22:53.123 --> 00:22:56.293
we were on our way
from the airport.

181
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.132
The house was all I had left.

182
00:26:02.688 --> 00:26:04.731
They are dried up.

183
00:27:20.474 --> 00:27:23.435
I haven't collected
the letters yet.

184
00:27:27.439 --> 00:27:30.234
They shouldn't get ruined in rain.

185
00:27:34.863 --> 00:27:38.367
I didn't find the time to reply to them.

186
00:27:38.492 --> 00:27:41.286
The flowers and candles.

187
00:27:41.411 --> 00:27:44.498
I couldn't answer them yet.

188
00:27:45.749 --> 00:27:47.876
I don't know when I can.

189
00:27:49.169 --> 00:27:51.338
When?

190
00:28:09.815 --> 00:28:15.445
I don't know if I should leave them or take them?

191
00:29:06.705 --> 00:29:10.125
I am in agony.

192
00:29:10.876 --> 00:29:17.466
And these thoughts increase my pain.

193
00:29:18.217 --> 00:29:23.430
You want to hold on to the past.

194
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:29.436
But some things are more powerful than you

195
00:29:29.561 --> 00:29:32.022
and bring you to your knees.

196
00:29:32.773 --> 00:29:35.692
It is unbelievable.

197
00:29:36.318 --> 00:29:40.030
It is twisted.

198
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:46.745
No one can explain how life changes.

199
00:29:48.872 --> 00:29:53.293
The upstairs hasn't changed since they left.

200
00:30:12.604 --> 00:30:16.358
I am living every day with their memory.

201
00:30:16.483 --> 00:30:20.612
I am fighting for them every day.

202
00:30:21.363 --> 00:30:25.325
This is how I find the will to continue.

203
00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:28.328
It is all in this house.

204
00:30:28.453 --> 00:30:30.914
When I am away for a few hours...

205
00:30:32.249 --> 00:30:34.501
I miss the house and must go back.

206
00:30:38.297 --> 00:30:41.258
The first thing I wrote when I got out.

207
00:30:41.383 --> 00:30:44.803
Those criminals. the generals and mullahs...

208
00:30:44.928 --> 00:30:47.598
I didn't let them reach you and your daughter.

209
00:31:07.492 --> 00:31:13.582
My plan was to launch a lawsuit in Canada

210
00:31:13.707 --> 00:31:17.127
to seek justice.

211
00:31:19.922 --> 00:31:23.133
I was going to fight alone...

212
00:31:23.258 --> 00:31:26.803
And take this to the courts.

213
00:31:28.555 --> 00:31:32.601
But meeting with lawyers.

214
00:31:32.726 --> 00:31:37.397
that was a rude
awakening for me.

215
00:31:38.106 --> 00:31:42.986
They said if I want the truth
and get justice.

216
00:31:43.111 --> 00:31:47.699
the Canadian government must act

217
00:31:47.824 --> 00:31:53.539
to petition the International Court of Justice.

218
00:33:36.934 --> 00:33:40.771
Several months passed and nothing happened.

219
00:33:40.896 --> 00:33:43.148
We tried to pressure
the government.

220
00:33:43.273 --> 00:33:46.151
the foreign minister.
minister of transportation.

221
00:33:46.276 --> 00:33:50.364
We were told that things take time.

222
00:33:58.956 --> 00:34:03.377
There is little room for hope.

223
00:34:03.502 --> 00:34:07.005
But we must keep trying.

224
00:34:18.308 --> 00:34:21.311
<i>What is it?</i>

225
00:34:23.897 --> 00:34:26.275
<i>It's a missile.</i>

226
00:34:27.025 --> 00:34:28.527
We must know what happened.

227
00:34:28.652 --> 00:34:31.029
Strange things happened
that night.

228
00:34:31.154 --> 00:34:33.574
There is something about this flight.

229
00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:35.617
that led to their attack.

230
00:34:35.742 --> 00:34:40.163
I mean. there is a mystery
in this case.

231
00:34:45.543 --> 00:34:49.297
The most important thing is investigation.

232
00:34:50.007 --> 00:34:52.801
We want to know what happened.

233
00:34:52.926 --> 00:34:58.515
If they claim it was
"human error". what caused it?

234
00:35:00.184 --> 00:35:03.562
Keeping the sky open wasn't human error.

235
00:35:03.687 --> 00:35:07.816
They sent bulldozers on the first day.

236
00:35:07.941 --> 00:35:10.652
They removed everything.

237
00:35:54.196 --> 00:35:56.365
Madame. don't film.

238
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.033
Okay.

239
00:36:00.118 --> 00:36:03.914
They robbed all of the valuables.

240
00:36:04.039 --> 00:36:05.624
Without exception.

241
00:36:05.749 --> 00:36:09.795
None of the victims' valuables were returned.

242
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.215
The relatives can confirm that.

243
00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:20.866
The 752 case is not about air safety.

244
00:37:20.991 --> 00:37:24.203
There is no aviation safety issue

245
00:37:24.328 --> 00:37:28.832
other than a military act
against a civilian aircraft.

246
00:37:28.957 --> 00:37:32.920
There was no technical issue with the airplane.

247
00:37:33.045 --> 00:37:37.007
There was no air traffic issue at the airport.

248
00:37:37.132 --> 00:37:42.054
There was no radar or air traffic control issue.

249
00:37:42.179 --> 00:37:46.058
There was no technical or air safety problem.

250
00:37:46.892 --> 00:37:51.980
The only issue was that a military.
security system...

251
00:37:52.105 --> 00:37:55.442
Positions an air defence battery
near the airport...

252
00:37:55.567 --> 00:37:58.612
And that is where our story begins.

253
00:38:11.416 --> 00:38:13.252
They submit to investigations.

254
00:38:13.377 --> 00:38:17.005
We have a right to be present...

255
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.175
in any examination
of the black boxes.

256
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.720
We will not surrender them to others.

257
00:39:38.212 --> 00:39:42.049
What does that mean? How much longer?

258
00:39:42.174 --> 00:39:45.093
Negotiations can't take forever.

259
00:42:50.445 --> 00:42:52.072
Hello. how are you?

260
00:42:54.366 --> 00:42:57.411
<i>Mr. Esmaeilion. I have only 7 or 8 minutes.</i>

261
00:42:57.536 --> 00:43:00.455
<i>No more.
so I will get to the point.</i>

262
00:43:00.581 --> 00:43:02.165
Okay. go ahead.

263
00:43:06.753 --> 00:43:09.173
<i>I have things to tell you.</i>

264
00:43:09.298 --> 00:43:13.427
<i>It is up to you to believe me or not.</i>

265
00:43:13.552 --> 00:43:15.429
- Yes.
<i>- I live in...</i>

266
00:43:17.764 --> 00:43:21.185
<i>I don't need anything.</i>

267
00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:25.189
<i>No need for money. or to come to Canada.
I have a friend...</i>

268
00:43:27.482 --> 00:43:32.279
<i>He works in one of
Iran's intelligence organizations.</i>

269
00:43:32.404 --> 00:43:36.909
<i>He told me things about that night.</i>

270
00:43:39.161 --> 00:43:42.706
<i>He talked to me about that night.</i>

271
00:43:42.831 --> 00:43:46.084
<i>About who they removed from the plane.</i>

272
00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.213
<i>He had some documents with him.</i>

273
00:43:49.338 --> 00:43:52.883
<i>I saw those documents.</i>

274
00:43:53.008 --> 00:43:57.679
<i>Photographs from
the command centre.</i>

275
00:43:58.972 --> 00:44:03.310
<i>The papers that were exchanged.</i>

276
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.939
<i>He had a lot of documents with him.</i>

277
00:44:07.064 --> 00:44:10.108
<i>Why was he afraid to show these to the media?</i>

278
00:44:10.234 --> 00:44:13.737
<i>He said it's not just the Iranians.
the Russians are also after him.</i>

279
00:44:13.862 --> 00:44:17.741
<i>I asked what the Russians
have to do with it.</i>

280
00:44:17.866 --> 00:44:22.579
<i>It wasn't just the Iranians.
the Russians were involved.</i>

281
00:44:22.704 --> 00:44:27.042
<i>He has a lot of documents
about the plane that night.</i>

282
00:44:27.167 --> 00:44:31.046
<i>A lot of documents. a lot of information.</i>

283
00:44:31.171 --> 00:44:34.341
<i>I can tell you that this person
is the black box of that night.</i>

284
00:44:34.466 --> 00:44:37.636
<i>If you are serious
about the truth.</i>

285
00:44:37.761 --> 00:44:43.183
<i>if you really want to know
what happened that night.</i>

286
00:44:43.308 --> 00:44:47.187
<i>this person can give you
all that information.</i>

287
00:44:47.312 --> 00:44:49.982
<i>In any court.</i>

288
00:44:50.107 --> 00:44:52.526
<i>Let me add something else...</i>

289
00:45:21.597 --> 00:45:24.016
I was walking yesterday.

290
00:45:24.766 --> 00:45:28.478
A woman approached me.

291
00:45:29.479 --> 00:45:33.317
There was some small talk.

292
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:39.740
She had Reera's health card.

293
00:45:41.742 --> 00:45:44.703
It's the only thing left
from Reera...

294
00:45:44.828 --> 00:45:48.165
Was delivered to another family.

295
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:49.958
The only item.

296
00:46:08.143 --> 00:46:10.187
Hello. how are you?

297
00:46:10.312 --> 00:46:11.772
Hello.

298
00:46:12.648 --> 00:46:14.399
Thank you very much.

299
00:46:14.525 --> 00:46:17.069
Thanks. How did this reach you?

300
00:46:17.194 --> 00:46:20.739
A friend gave it to me.

301
00:46:21.406 --> 00:46:24.910
It's been a few months. I couldn't reach you.

302
00:46:25.035 --> 00:46:28.163
You had it for a few months?

303
00:46:28.288 --> 00:46:31.291
Very kind of you.

304
00:46:33.627 --> 00:46:36.255
This is the least I could do.

305
00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.633
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

306
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:37.649
In our case. every conceivable
crime has been committed.

307
00:47:37.774 --> 00:47:43.655
Every filthy thing you can think of.

308
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:47.910
Even torturing family members.

309
00:47:51.413 --> 00:47:55.209
They used the passengers as a human shield.

310
00:47:55.334 --> 00:47:59.463
We believe they fired intentionally.

311
00:47:59.588 --> 00:48:02.508
I will leave it to others to prove.

312
00:48:02.633 --> 00:48:06.178
Every day they said some nonsense on their TV.

313
00:48:06.303 --> 00:48:09.223
From their leader to some petty officer.

314
00:48:09.348 --> 00:48:12.059
Saying it was a spy plane.
we are happy we shot it down.

315
00:48:12.768 --> 00:48:16.730
We want to stop a big war...

316
00:48:16.855 --> 00:48:20.984
with a war.

317
00:48:22.945 --> 00:48:25.781
This is our only option.

318
00:48:28.909 --> 00:48:32.079
We had to surprise the enemy.

319
00:48:33.372 --> 00:48:36.708
We had to deceive the enemy.

320
00:48:37.376 --> 00:48:42.840
We had to be prepared for retaliation.

321
00:48:42.965 --> 00:48:47.636
We took our game of war to the end.

322
00:48:47.761 --> 00:48:51.890
This was not a battlefield where...

323
00:48:52.015 --> 00:48:55.394
we think we would attack and that will be the end.

324
00:48:57.229 --> 00:48:59.481
Put yourselves in our place.

325
00:48:59.606 --> 00:49:02.651
We hit the American base.

326
00:49:03.944 --> 00:49:06.864
He claimed to target 52 points.

327
00:49:06.989 --> 00:49:09.116
He reacts.

328
00:49:09.241 --> 00:49:13.287
What do you do?
What will he do in return?

329
00:49:14.121 --> 00:49:18.667
<i>We were the source of the theory ourselves...</i>

330
00:49:19.626 --> 00:49:24.715
<i>that our missile might have been fired.</i>

331
00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:28.886
<i>Only because it happened at the same time.</i>

332
00:49:30.262 --> 00:49:34.558
<i>And if we were not the source...</i>

333
00:49:37.269 --> 00:49:40.606
<i>for shaping this theory...</i>

334
00:49:42.274 --> 00:49:46.486
<i>no one could find out.</i>

335
00:49:48.197 --> 00:49:51.742
<i>We did not touch anything.</i>

336
00:49:53.243 --> 00:49:58.165
<i>Neither removing the airplane pieces
nor disturbing the scene.</i>

337
00:50:00.125 --> 00:50:02.836
<i>Nor moving the missile unit.</i>

338
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.964
<i>Neither the radar graphs.</i>

339
00:53:02.933 --> 00:53:05.936
Down with the Islamic Republic!

340
00:53:09.147 --> 00:53:13.026
Justice! Justice! Justice!

341
00:53:17.573 --> 00:53:20.742
Justice! Justice! Justice!

342
00:53:27.958 --> 00:53:32.754
The so-called statement has no legal basis.

343
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:36.884
And cannot determine the deadline.

344
00:53:37.593 --> 00:53:41.221
If there is any will and intent...

345
00:53:41.346 --> 00:53:45.809
for an impartial.
independent investigation...

346
00:53:45.934 --> 00:53:48.854
based on the law and justice...

347
00:53:48.979 --> 00:53:53.025
the judge must rectify
the shortcomings.

348
00:53:55.152 --> 00:53:59.198
Justice! Justice! Justice!

349
00:53:59.323 --> 00:54:04.119
Where innocent people come for justice...

350
00:54:04.244 --> 00:54:08.248
they shut them up.

351
00:54:08.373 --> 00:54:11.502
They won't let their voices be heard.

352
00:54:11.627 --> 00:54:14.379
They don't listen to their protests.

353
00:54:14.505 --> 00:54:17.591
The judge in charge is hiding.

354
00:54:17.716 --> 00:54:20.719
The prosecutor lies.

355
00:54:20.844 --> 00:54:24.014
The investigator secretly closes the file.

356
00:55:51.643 --> 00:55:57.274
Why should the government in Canada
go as fast as you want?

357
00:55:57.399 --> 00:56:01.028
What happened so far was due to your persistence.

358
00:56:01.153 --> 00:56:03.155
What would happen if we weren't there?

359
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:10.704
Without you they'd just offer compensation.

360
00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:14.458
85 Canadians were killed.

361
00:56:14.583 --> 00:56:17.878
Imagine they had no one.

362
00:56:18.837 --> 00:56:20.881
Imagine we didn't exist.

363
00:56:21.882 --> 00:56:25.385
What would you do if you were
Canada's Prime Minister?

364
00:58:43.315 --> 00:58:46.735
They told you their neutrality prohibits them...

365
00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:50.489
from responding to your call for justice?

366
00:58:51.949 --> 00:58:53.450
Yes.

367
01:00:49.399 --> 01:00:50.526
Hello.

368
01:00:51.193 --> 01:00:54.238
<i>- Hello.</i>
- How are you?

369
01:00:54.363 --> 01:00:56.823
<i>Thank you.</i>

370
01:00:56.949 --> 01:01:01.954
I am calling about your message.

371
01:01:02.913 --> 01:01:05.123
<i>Yes. I am at your service.</i>

372
01:01:05.249 --> 01:01:09.753
There is background noise. Can you hear me?

373
01:01:09.878 --> 01:01:13.632
<i>Yes. I hear you. I am playing
prayers so I won't be heard outside.</i>

374
01:01:13.757 --> 01:01:18.512
Can you explain a little more?

375
01:01:18.637 --> 01:01:22.140
<i>There are two letters. There is a lot more.</i>

376
01:01:22.266 --> 01:01:24.518
<i>About that incident.</i>

377
01:01:24.643 --> 01:01:27.437
<i>But to start our work.</i>

378
01:01:27.563 --> 01:01:33.068
<i>so you can find justice
or whatever else in court.</i>

379
01:01:33.193 --> 01:01:35.988
<i>there is a voice recording</i>

380
01:01:36.113 --> 01:01:40.826
<i>from Shamkhani on the night
of the incident.</i>

381
01:01:40.951 --> 01:01:43.954
<i>He tells the aerospace commander...</i>

382
01:01:44.079 --> 01:01:46.456
<i>when the mission is ordered.</i>

383
01:01:46.582 --> 01:01:50.252
Many people have contacted me.

384
01:01:50.377 --> 01:01:55.132
I am responding one by one.

385
01:01:55.257 --> 01:02:00.429
Put yourself in my place.

386
01:02:00.554 --> 01:02:06.310
I must know...

387
01:02:08.478 --> 01:02:12.232
I must see something.

388
01:02:12.357 --> 01:02:16.486
<i>I can send you an extract of the first letter.</i>

389
01:02:16.612 --> 01:02:21.575
<i>Because the rest is sensitive.
I will be in trouble.</i>

390
01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:27.331
You are helping us only for money?

391
01:02:29.082 --> 01:02:32.336
<i>I have money trouble. Yes.</i>

392
01:02:32.461 --> 01:02:35.130
<i>I also don't want my identity to be revealed.</i>

393
01:02:35.255 --> 01:02:38.300
<i>You know what it's like in Iran.</i>

394
01:02:38.425 --> 01:02:45.933
Of course we need the original documents
to use them as evidence.

395
01:02:46.642 --> 01:02:50.270
<i>Of course. I will send you the originals.</i>

396
01:02:50.395 --> 01:02:52.564
<i>No problem.</i>

397
01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:56.944
Very well. I will wait.

398
01:02:58.779 --> 01:03:05.160
<i>- I am at your service.</i>
- Thank you.

399
01:03:22.052 --> 01:03:25.055
Sounded like a military man.

400
01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:28.016
Yes. Religious. military.

401
01:03:28.684 --> 01:03:31.520
$75.000 is not much money to ask.

402
01:03:33.397 --> 01:03:36.191
He is low-balling to lure you in.

403
01:03:36.316 --> 01:03:38.819
It's not because he wants it.

404
01:03:39.319 --> 01:03:43.532
I think he was low ranking.
nothing with authority.

405
01:03:43.657 --> 01:03:45.284
Yes.

406
01:04:51.642 --> 01:04:53.727
Will they follow up?

407
01:04:53.852 --> 01:04:56.855
- Will there be a criminal case?
- No.

408
01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:00.609
At the end I said we will go to Ukraine.

409
01:05:02.361 --> 01:05:05.280
- I said we will go to Ukraine.
- Okay.

410
01:05:05.405 --> 01:05:07.324
She said. "Okay. go ahead."

411
01:05:28.971 --> 01:05:31.932
No one should know we are going to Kyiv.

412
01:05:34.101 --> 01:05:37.104
Nothing to worry about. Kyiv is a safe city.

413
01:05:38.522 --> 01:05:41.900
The government officials know about this trip.

414
01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:44.653
There is nothing to worry about.

415
01:05:44.778 --> 01:05:48.282
But no one should know until we return.

416
01:06:13.515 --> 01:06:17.269
I liked this airport.

417
01:06:17.936 --> 01:06:20.022
Now I hate all airports.

418
01:06:21.106 --> 01:06:23.901
It took hold of me since I entered the airport.

419
01:06:25.277 --> 01:06:28.238
I must go on this trip.

420
01:06:28.363 --> 01:06:31.241
I don't want to get on an airplane.

421
01:06:33.994 --> 01:06:35.787
I don't want to anymore.

422
01:06:37.581 --> 01:06:40.083
We are delayed by one hour.

423
01:06:40.792 --> 01:06:46.131
Exactly like flight PS752.

424
01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:53.222
You've been waiting 15 months
for this trip to Ukraine.

425
01:06:53.347 --> 01:07:00.145
More than that. we wanted to go since May 2020.

426
01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:05.317
Then with COVID they re-scheduled for December.

427
01:07:06.485 --> 01:07:11.114
The visit was cancelled at the last minute.

428
01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.034
Then they preferred to meet online.

429
01:07:14.159 --> 01:07:17.996
We asked and waited for them to come.

430
01:07:19.498 --> 01:07:22.000
The Canadian Government said no.

431
01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:24.837
And we decided to go. We will go.

432
01:10:45.078 --> 01:10:50.125
Finally. the Ukrainian Justice ministry
is coming to Canada to begin investigations.

433
01:10:59.343 --> 01:11:02.679
I hired a lawyer when I was in Iran

434
01:11:02.804 --> 01:11:09.728
to receive Reera and Parisa's belongings
if they delivered anything.

435
01:11:09.853 --> 01:11:12.648
He sent me some photos later.

436
01:11:12.773 --> 01:11:15.150
Keys. an iPhone and a watch.

437
01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:18.111
He asked if I could identify any of them.

438
01:11:18.237 --> 01:11:21.323
The phone had Parisa's name on it.

439
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:25.369
I immediately recognized Parisa's Apple Watch.

440
01:11:28.372 --> 01:11:30.415
Push the button.

441
01:11:38.257 --> 01:11:41.009
Let it charge.

442
01:11:41.134 --> 01:11:43.262
Did you see?

443
01:11:49.101 --> 01:11:53.021
I need to know if she was alive...

444
01:11:53.146 --> 01:11:55.983
during those 3 minutes and 42 seconds.

445
01:11:56.108 --> 01:12:00.571
If the heart rate was recorded on her watch.

446
01:12:13.876 --> 01:12:16.128
I know it was two days before.

447
01:12:16.253 --> 01:12:19.590
- On the sixth.
- It was more than two days.

448
01:12:19.715 --> 01:12:24.261
- This is the fourth.
- Here is the sixth.

449
01:12:26.471 --> 01:12:29.016
That is not in Iran.

450
01:12:29.141 --> 01:12:31.518
That is not in Iran.

451
01:12:31.643 --> 01:12:35.564
See if it powers on.

452
01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:42.779
It came on for one moment.

453
01:13:08.055 --> 01:13:10.349
A faint light is on.

454
01:13:12.935 --> 01:13:17.564
Let's see if it has historical data.

455
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:19.858
I can't see it on mine.

456
01:13:19.983 --> 01:13:22.569
This couldn't happen in the crash.

457
01:13:22.694 --> 01:13:25.906
I want to know if it comes on.

458
01:13:26.031 --> 01:13:29.326
- Plug it in.
- I have once before.

459
01:13:29.451 --> 01:13:34.623
We need to send it in for repair.

460
01:13:34.748 --> 01:13:39.169
But if you send it in. they make you sign...

461
01:13:39.294 --> 01:13:42.965
Look it powered on.

462
01:13:43.423 --> 01:13:46.802
- What do you mean?
- It shows 2:41.

463
01:13:46.927 --> 01:13:50.097
The Iran time is 2:41 now.

464
01:13:50.222 --> 01:13:53.892
What is the time in Iran now?

465
01:13:57.479 --> 01:13:59.606
Yes. it is powered up.

466
01:13:59.731 --> 01:14:02.109
Don't press on the screen.

467
01:14:02.234 --> 01:14:03.819
Just move the knob.

468
01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:06.363
- This one?
- Yes.

469
01:14:06.488 --> 01:14:10.158
Come show me how.

470
01:14:10.284 --> 01:14:13.787
- It moves up and down.
- Can you tap on it?

471
01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:20.586
The last message was mine.

472
01:14:22.588 --> 01:14:25.007
She had another message too.

473
01:14:28.594 --> 01:14:32.931
I can't tap the screen for messages.

474
01:14:34.308 --> 01:14:39.771
Put the SIM card in your phone...

475
01:14:41.106 --> 01:14:43.817
See if it is her phone or not.

476
01:14:43.942 --> 01:14:46.820
I want to know if this is Parisa's phone or not.

477
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:53.869
- It is like bringing the dead to life...
- It's backwards.

478
01:14:55.996 --> 01:15:00.584
Call my number to see if it works.

479
01:15:08.926 --> 01:15:12.971
- The card is not working.
- How can it be?

480
01:15:13.096 --> 01:15:15.891
This doesn't belong to Parisa.

481
01:16:00.936 --> 01:16:05.482
I don't know if it was me or Parisa...

482
01:16:05.607 --> 01:16:11.446
It was me. Parisa didn't ask these questions.

483
01:16:12.906 --> 01:16:18.829
I asked where she wants to be buried after death.

484
01:16:22.583 --> 01:16:24.418
She said...

485
01:16:25.794 --> 01:16:28.213
"Whatever Reera wants."

486
01:16:39.308 --> 01:16:43.312
When this disaster happened...

487
01:16:47.357 --> 01:16:49.943
I had to answer this question myself.

488
01:16:50.068 --> 01:16:51.612
Where and how.

489
01:16:53.405 --> 01:16:56.325
Reera wasn't there for me to ask her.

490
01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:00.329
But I knew what her answer would be.

491
01:17:01.914 --> 01:17:03.957
It would be in Canada.

492
01:17:04.082 --> 01:17:13.550
And because Parisa loved lakes
and the sea...

493
01:17:15.177 --> 01:17:18.138
I searched to find somewhere near water.

494
01:17:19.306 --> 01:17:22.351
Near a river or a lake.

495
01:17:22.476 --> 01:17:25.812
Now it is near a small lake.

496
01:17:25.938 --> 01:17:30.776
We chose that location.

497
01:17:30.901 --> 01:17:36.532
The symbol on the site was
very important for me...

498
01:17:36.657 --> 01:17:42.037
that it represents three people.

499
01:17:43.455 --> 01:17:46.625
I think all three of us were destroyed.

500
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:53.006
Two of them left but the third...
is practically gone.

501
01:18:05.394 --> 01:18:10.941
I wanted something beautiful to be left behind
on this earth.

502
01:18:12.192 --> 01:18:16.363
One of them could be the grave site.

503
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:28.417
People should know about those...

504
01:18:28.542 --> 01:18:32.713
whose lives were unjustly taken.

505
01:19:32.439 --> 01:19:34.816
When I returned from Iran.
I searched her room.

506
01:19:34.942 --> 01:19:37.986
I found her laptop. She didn't take it.

507
01:19:42.241 --> 01:19:44.826
I haven't found the courage to open it yet.

508
01:20:12.604 --> 01:20:15.274
What is the last thing she searched for?

509
01:20:20.904 --> 01:20:23.448
This is her last search.

510
01:20:39.506 --> 01:20:41.133
This was open.

511
01:20:52.311 --> 01:20:55.022
Her mail is open. My God.

512
01:22:06.218 --> 01:22:10.055
WINTER

513
01:22:12.474 --> 01:22:14.434
REERA

514
01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.478
PARISA

515
01:24:38.579 --> 01:24:42.165
Remember when you and I began.

516
01:24:42.291 --> 01:24:47.421
you said something that
I completely believe.

517
01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.301
There is no justice.

518
01:24:52.426 --> 01:24:58.015
What justice? What will satisfy me?

519
01:25:01.768 --> 01:25:06.106
But it is worth fighting for.

520
01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:11.528
That means if I...

521
01:25:14.865 --> 01:25:20.162
...wouldn't pursue this
as one of the families.

522
01:25:20.287 --> 01:25:22.581
I could never forgive myself.

523
01:25:22.706 --> 01:25:26.752
I couldn't. I had no other way.

524
01:25:27.419 --> 01:25:29.838
What is the right way?

525
01:25:29.963 --> 01:25:33.967
Other than crying out in pursuit of justice.

526
01:25:36.053 --> 01:25:40.098
But the lost right will never be returned.

527
01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:47.481
Ordinary people are helpless...

528
01:25:47.606 --> 01:25:50.275
in getting justice for their loved ones.

529
01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:56.865
There is no light on the horizon.

530
01:25:56.990 --> 01:26:01.912
But we should try. even with a glimmer of hope.

531
01:26:06.041 --> 01:26:11.964
If I will ever have peace in my life again...

532
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:19.137
It is impossible. I don't believe I will.

533
01:26:19.263 --> 01:26:22.558
Tranquility? What does it mean?

534
01:26:31.275 --> 01:26:33.944
I don't know. peace and calm...

535
01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:39.241
Maybe because I have not experienced it
for the past two. three years.

536
01:26:39.366 --> 01:26:44.121
This word is strange to me... Peace.

537
01:26:44.913 --> 01:26:47.708
It means coming home
with peace of mind.

538
01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:50.169
to have things to look forward to.

539
01:26:52.421 --> 01:26:57.467
To think about them and plan for them.

540
01:26:58.594 --> 01:27:01.763
It is impossible for me to recreate that.

541
01:27:04.141 --> 01:27:09.479
No. Never. I am sure.

542
01:27:09.605 --> 01:27:14.109
Because two years have passed with no change.

543
01:27:16.987 --> 01:27:19.823
I think it will continue like this.

544
01:27:21.158 --> 01:27:24.453
What I can see with the others.

545
01:27:24.578 --> 01:27:28.373
it gets worse for some. but never better.
It stays the same.

546
01:30:10.369 --> 01:30:12.871
I'm reading the news from Ukraine.

547
01:30:15.457 --> 01:30:19.586
Russia has connected Crimea to Mariupol.

548
01:30:19.711 --> 01:30:23.632
They're sending troops there.
There's cholera in Mariupol.

549
01:30:23.757 --> 01:30:27.886
They're opening 10 thousand war crimes cases.

550
01:30:28.011 --> 01:30:30.931
They must investigate them.

551
01:30:31.515 --> 01:30:35.853
There is no end in sight for the war.

552
01:30:35.978 --> 01:30:39.439
Russia has occupied 20% of Ukraine.

553
01:30:46.113 --> 01:30:49.908
War broke out just when
we were getting somewhere.

554
01:30:51.743 --> 01:30:54.705
After 18 months of hard work.

555
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:57.583
finally convincing the Canadian government.

556
01:30:57.708 --> 01:31:00.711
They weren't opening a criminal case.

557
01:31:01.545 --> 01:31:04.173
The Ukrainian Justice Ministry
team finally arrived

558
01:31:04.298 --> 01:31:06.425
on February 22.

559
01:31:08.051 --> 01:31:10.095
War broke out within 48 hours.

560
01:31:12.222 --> 01:31:14.892
It is not morally right for us to push

561
01:31:15.017 --> 01:31:17.936
a country that has lost thousands...

562
01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:22.065
to prioritize our case for 177 victims.

563
01:31:47.299 --> 01:31:49.176
I will not give up.

564
01:31:50.552 --> 01:31:53.222
I told them a hundred times. I will say it again.

565
01:31:53.347 --> 01:31:54.890
I will not give up.

566
01:31:55.015 --> 01:31:59.937
Despite war. elections. government change...

567
01:32:00.062 --> 01:32:03.190
COVID. or anything else that may happen.

568
01:32:04.233 --> 01:32:08.570
Every time we were knocked down.
we got back up again.

569
01:32:08.695 --> 01:32:11.740
It happened many times in two and a half years.

570
01:32:16.745 --> 01:32:18.789
I will not give up.
