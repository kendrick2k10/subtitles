3
00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:08.501
This is not quite
the spiritual awakening

4
00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:09.836
I was searching for.

5
00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:24.150
Make it stop.

6
00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:48.266
Hey. wait up.

7
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.502
Hey.

8
00:02:49.534 --> 00:02:50.745
I just wanted to say
thanks for that 20.

9
00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.538
Most people just
give me loose change.

10
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.782
You got an album
out or something?

11
00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.575
Yeah. here. um. let
me give you a link.

12
00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.810
Oh. yeah. actually
used to play a little ah.

13
00:02:57.842 --> 00:02:59.744
French horn back in junior high.

14
00:02:59.777 --> 00:03:00.579
Oh.

15
00:03:00.612 --> 00:03:01.612
So.

16
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:03.782
Hey!

17
00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:04.817
Hey!

18
00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:05.849
Hey!

19
00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:08.385
Hey!

20
00:03:47.992 --> 00:03:49.961
Welcome home.

21
00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:50.896
You got four egg rolls. right?

22
00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:52.265
Last time you only got two.

23
00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.770
Bam. Bell & Ross.

24
00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:00.039
It's fake.

25
00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.039
What?

26
00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:02.908
Yeah. ticking. see. not smooth.

27
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:03.977
It's not real.

28
00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.415
You get any cash out of him?

29
00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:11.016
I actually cried this time.

30
00:04:11.717 --> 00:04:13.853
Oh. little Meryl Streep.

31
00:04:33.771 --> 00:04:34.771
Emily.

32
00:04:44.415 --> 00:04:45.483
How we lookin'?

33
00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:47.519
I'll give you 1.500.

34
00:04:47.552 --> 00:04:48.687
Deal.

35
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:49.922
Let me get you some money.

36
00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:53.725
Babe. look who decided to
grace us with her presence.

37
00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.429
Oh. Emily. perfect.

38
00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:57.997
So I just whipped
up some jambalaya.

39
00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:59.331
Are you hungry?

40
00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:00.066
Ah. yeah.

41
00:05:00.098 --> 00:05:01.466
As if he just whipped it up.

42
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.401
He's been in the
kitchen all morning.

43
00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:04.503
I'm a master at work here.

44
00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:07.072
Oh um. this came
and I brought it up.

45
00:05:07.105 --> 00:05:09.074
Awesome. I love when these come.

46
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:13.945
Oh. these are my favorite. the
little pictures. the drawing.

47
00:05:13.978 --> 00:05:17.349
Oh my God. look how
big he is. babe.

48
00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:19.617
Ah. look at him.

49
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:21.052
He was so little.

50
00:05:21.086 --> 00:05:21.920
That's our guy.

51
00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:22.954
So crazy.

52
00:05:23.922 --> 00:05:24.957
What about Camilla?

53
00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:31.596
Yeah. um. that's
partly why I'm here.

54
00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:34.665
What's going on?

55
00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:36.869
Well. she's sick.

56
00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:43.942
How'd you do?

57
00:05:43.975 --> 00:05:45.978
Got two grand.

58
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:49.081
Whoa. that's fantastic.

59
00:05:49.113 --> 00:05:50.548
This better pay off.

60
00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:52.093
Listen. remember that
Redstone job last year?

61
00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:54.019
Mm. the one where everyone died?

62
00:05:54.052 --> 00:05:56.021
Real risk. means
real reward. right?

63
00:05:56.053 --> 00:05:58.089
Get to the point.

64
00:05:58.122 --> 00:06:00.658
Well. I found out who
set that whole thing up.

65
00:06:00.692 --> 00:06:02.061
The name's Lizzy.

66
00:06:02.093 --> 00:06:03.695
Lizzy?

67
00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.980
No. no. over there!

68
00:06:25.117 --> 00:06:27.586
Okay. five grand. gets
a look at the file.

69
00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:29.755
another five for exclusivity.

70
00:06:29.788 --> 00:06:30.923
10 grand?

71
00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:32.691
You gotta pay to play.

72
00:06:32.723 --> 00:06:33.725
We only have five.

73
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.029
Fine. but you take
what I give you.

74
00:06:39.997 --> 00:06:41.199
The name is Benjamin Elwood.

75
00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:43.168
lives in an estate
outside of Houston.

76
00:06:45.036 --> 00:06:47.606
He's on some kind
of spiritual quest.

77
00:06:49.007 --> 00:06:51.177
traveling all over the
world looking for answers.

78
00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:53.111
trying to find God.

79
00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:57.483
Hello!

80
00:06:57.516 --> 00:06:59.919
God!

81
00:06:59.951 --> 00:07:03.689
This is. I could buy
and sell this place!

82
00:07:03.721 --> 00:07:04.889
I can buy and sell you!

83
00:07:04.923 --> 00:07:06.192
He's grieving. desperate.

84
00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:08.527
I mean crazy. obviously.

85
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.495
but he also happens
to be very rich.

86
00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:11.497
How rich?

87
00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:12.697
Very.

88
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.500
Hey. why don't you
talk to me. you coward!

89
00:07:16.201 --> 00:07:17.903
I don't get it.

90
00:07:17.935 --> 00:07:20.572
But I haven't even gotten to
the best part. he's unbanked.

91
00:07:20.605 --> 00:07:22.007
What's that?

92
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.641
Unbanked.

93
00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:26.045
The word is he has
the whole of his fortune

94
00:07:26.077 --> 00:07:27.088
somewhere on his property.

95
00:07:27.112 --> 00:07:28.814
I'm not going anywhere!

96
00:07:28.846 --> 00:07:29.814
Sir. why don't you come with me?

97
00:07:29.848 --> 00:07:31.516
Get your hands off of me!

98
00:07:32.783 --> 00:07:34.719
It's all in the file.

99
00:07:37.154 --> 00:07:38.089
He's delusional.

100
00:07:38.122 --> 00:07:40.625
Come on. he lost his family.

101
00:07:40.658 --> 00:07:42.127
Yeah. so?

102
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.637
So. you would think that
we know what that feels like.

103
00:07:43.661 --> 00:07:47.098
No. it will give us
insight on things to use.

104
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.069
Need I remind you you collect
checks for fake orphans?

105
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.205
We gotta use his grief.

106
00:07:53.237 --> 00:07:57.108
and tap into it and use
it to manipulate him.

107
00:07:57.141 --> 00:07:59.711
Like. okay. okay. okay.

108
00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:03.983
so we. we stage a
religious epiphany.

109
00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:07.220
What like put Jesus'
face on a piece of toast?

110
00:08:08.252 --> 00:08:09.654
You know the deal.

111
00:08:09.687 --> 00:08:12.156
If we both aren't into
it. we don't do it.

112
00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:13.024
Oh. come on.

113
00:08:13.057 --> 00:08:14.961
We need to come up
with something else.

114
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.308
Hi.

115
00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:32.010
Hi.

116
00:08:32.043 --> 00:08:32.877
Dion to the butcher department.

117
00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:34.432
Dion to the butcher
department. please.

118
00:08:35.212 --> 00:08:36.649
I like your shoes.

119
00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:37.682
Thanks.

120
00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.022
Lola. what're you doing?

121
00:08:43.054 --> 00:08:44.589
Been looking everywhere for ya.

122
00:08:44.623 --> 00:08:45.991
Can we have this?

123
00:08:46.024 --> 00:08:47.960
We don't really need this. okay?

124
00:08:49.193 --> 00:08:51.296
You scared me half to death.

125
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.233
I need you to stay with
me. all right. let's go.

126
00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:01.840
How about some candy?

127
00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:03.208
I can do some candy.

128
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.597
Not saying this isn't risky.

129
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.165
but our strategy is proven.

130
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.302
We've consistently
outperformed the market.

131
00:09:30.335 --> 00:09:32.204
We see returns of
upwards of 15 to 20%

132
00:09:32.236 --> 00:09:34.206
in a very short timeframe.

133
00:09:34.239 --> 00:09:35.774
I don't know.

134
00:09:35.807 --> 00:09:37.643
I've never done
anything this bullish.

135
00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:40.846
Look. you found us. not
because you wanna be safe.

136
00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.316
You wanna get off
the sidelines. right?

137
00:09:44.349 --> 00:09:46.252
All it takes is
making the right moves.

138
00:09:47.385 --> 00:09:49.322
We'll be with you
every step of the way.

139
00:09:50.688 --> 00:09:53.925
Oh. God. ah. what
can you do with 50?

140
00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:20.418
Hello. Micah.

141
00:10:21.385 --> 00:10:22.385
Who are you?

142
00:10:50.048 --> 00:10:53.351
Your brother.
he's very charming.

143
00:10:53.384 --> 00:10:56.688
and well. I'll
admit it. he got me.

144
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.458
He got me.

145
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.125
What're you talking about?

146
00:11:01.158 --> 00:11:03.961
Brass tacks. Micah here.

147
00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:05.998
made off with 100
grand of my money.

148
00:11:07.065 --> 00:11:10.769
and I'm gonna need to get
repaid one way or another.

149
00:11:10.802 --> 00:11:12.037
I'm gonna get you your money.

150
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:12.871
I just need more time.

151
00:11:12.903 --> 00:11:13.938
No!

152
00:11:21.446 --> 00:11:26.285
That reminds me of my dog.

153
00:11:27.284 --> 00:11:28.219
She makes the same face

154
00:11:28.253 --> 00:11:30.923
when she does something
she's not supposed to.

155
00:11:32.157 --> 00:11:35.160
I'll lock her in
her cage for days.

156
00:11:35.192 --> 00:11:37.361
She'll whine and whine
and she'll soil herself.

157
00:11:37.394 --> 00:11:39.064
but I don't pay her any mind.

158
00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:41.131
It's just a dog.

159
00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:44.903
Animals. they feel the shame.

160
00:11:47.172 --> 00:11:51.343
They need to wallow in it
to know the consequences.

161
00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:54.979
Right. Micah?

162
00:12:25.376 --> 00:12:27.746
Vaughn. what's the deal?

163
00:12:30.347 --> 00:12:32.416
I told you she has
nothing to do with this.

164
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:37.223
Hi. people take their
hearing for granted.

165
00:12:38.123 --> 00:12:39.425
It's actually quite fragile.

166
00:12:41.025 --> 00:12:42.927
Takes the right amount
of extended pressure

167
00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:44.529
to cause lasting damage.

168
00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:49.100
About 140 decibels can take out

169
00:12:49.134 --> 00:12:52.204
roughly half your
hearing in 20 minutes.

170
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.372
No. please.

171
00:12:58.043 --> 00:13:00.145
Is it true what
they say about twins?

172
00:13:01.346 --> 00:13:02.413
Can you feel his pain?

173
00:13:08.385 --> 00:13:09.587
About 140 decibels.

174
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.023
No. please!

175
00:13:12.857 --> 00:13:13.457
No. stop!

176
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.393
250!

177
00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.295
Stop. no. please. stop!

178
00:13:16.327 --> 00:13:17.562
We don't have it. I swear!

179
00:13:22.567 --> 00:13:24.970
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.
no. Vaughn. Vaughn. Vaughn!

180
00:13:25.003 --> 00:13:26.472
$200.000. all right?

181
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:32.211
200?

182
00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:33.524
It's double your money. 200.000.

183
00:13:35.346 --> 00:13:40.351
Mm. what do you
think about that?

184
00:13:40.618 --> 00:13:41.552
Yeah.

185
00:13:41.586 --> 00:13:42.586
Yeah. yeah.

186
00:13:44.556 --> 00:13:46.225
You're in on this too now.

187
00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:51.196
I'm gonna give you 10
days to get me my money.

188
00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:54.867
or I will lock you up in a cage.

189
00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:56.534
and I'll never let you out.

190
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:06.910
10 days.

191
00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:31.999
Where's the money?

192
00:14:34.038 --> 00:14:35.038
I lost it.

193
00:14:39.009 --> 00:14:40.913
You need to get outta here.

194
00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:44.250
This is on me.

195
00:14:45.582 --> 00:14:46.517
I'm not gonna bail on you.

196
00:14:46.551 --> 00:14:47.586
You have to.

197
00:14:49.354 --> 00:14:51.523
What happened today
is just the beginning.

198
00:14:51.556 --> 00:14:54.158
I don't know what
this guy's capable of.

199
00:14:54.192 --> 00:14:58.496
Look. I don't trust
you. but I love you. okay?

200
00:15:01.732 --> 00:15:03.434
I guess it's time to swing big.

201
00:15:09.506 --> 00:15:13.245
Okay. we are God's workers.

202
00:15:14.278 --> 00:15:16.048
So. angels.

203
00:15:17.048 --> 00:15:18.317
Yes. exactly. angels.

204
00:15:21.052 --> 00:15:23.254
We need to keep it
grounded. very realistic.

205
00:15:23.288 --> 00:15:24.690
This is a business deal. okay?

206
00:15:24.722 --> 00:15:26.657
We have a direct line to God.

207
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:28.494
and he can ask
anything he wants.

208
00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:31.964
With the right price.
we'll give him an answer.

209
00:15:34.631 --> 00:15:36.067
We need to gain his trust.

210
00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.601
Make it believable.

211
00:15:37.634 --> 00:15:40.271
Sure. find out what
this guy really wants.

212
00:16:30.721 --> 00:16:31.756
Mr. Elwood!

213
00:16:34.225 --> 00:16:35.225
Mr. Elwood!

214
00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:41.532
Hi!

215
00:16:44.635 --> 00:16:46.337
Ah. I'm Clint Chambers.

216
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.240
and this is my associate.
Samantha Crowley.

217
00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:50.542
May we have a
moment of your time?

218
00:16:50.575 --> 00:16:51.575
What?

219
00:16:52.677 --> 00:16:53.778
Can we talk?

220
00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:57.482
About what?

221
00:16:57.514 --> 00:16:58.793
We'd like to
discuss the incident

222
00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:00.719
that happened at Saint Teresa!

223
00:17:10.728 --> 00:17:14.332
I've already apologized
to Father Paul.

224
00:17:14.365 --> 00:17:15.834
I'm sure the Father
appreciated that.

225
00:17:15.866 --> 00:17:18.302
but we're actually here to
discuss a different matter.

226
00:17:20.637 --> 00:17:22.340
Please. it's very important.

227
00:17:25.175 --> 00:17:27.111
Wait a minute. I
know what this is.

228
00:17:29.547 --> 00:17:31.316
Yeah. follow me.

229
00:17:42.727 --> 00:17:43.727
Wait here.

230
00:17:45.663 --> 00:17:50.836
Is that a La Roche?

231
00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:52.871
Is it worth anything?

232
00:17:52.903 --> 00:17:54.743
Yeah. I mean. this alone
could pay back Vaughn.

233
00:17:55.772 --> 00:17:56.841
Maybe we just take this.

234
00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:59.845
I mean that's if
it's an original.

235
00:17:59.877 --> 00:18:01.679
Why would a guy
like him have a fake?

236
00:18:01.712 --> 00:18:04.816
20 grand. this should be enough

237
00:18:04.848 --> 00:18:06.784
to keep this from
becoming a real headache.

238
00:18:06.817 --> 00:18:07.985
Don't you think?

239
00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:11.323
If there's one thing I hate
more than clergy. it's lawyers.

240
00:18:11.355 --> 00:18:13.291
so please. all right.

241
00:18:14.424 --> 00:18:17.863
tell Jesus I said I'm
sorry. forgive me.

242
00:18:19.463 --> 00:18:20.698
Don't worry. I won't be back.

243
00:18:34.311 --> 00:18:35.880
God doesn't want your money.

244
00:18:37.582 --> 00:18:40.886
This is a 1962 bottle of scotch.

245
00:18:42.653 --> 00:18:46.692
It was a birthday gift
from my wife. my ex-wife.

246
00:18:49.861 --> 00:18:51.597
It's an $800 bottle.

247
00:18:53.498 --> 00:18:57.736
I drank four and change
this morning. so please.

248
00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:02.673
forgive me if I'm not
understanding you correctly.

249
00:19:03.907 --> 00:19:04.708
I think your
understanding me just fine.

250
00:19:04.741 --> 00:19:05.743
God heard you.

251
00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:08.580
He wants to talk with you.

252
00:19:08.613 --> 00:19:11.249
God wants to speak
to me in person.

253
00:19:11.281 --> 00:19:16.288
In person. no smoke and
mirrors. no burning bush.

254
00:19:18.923 --> 00:19:21.527
Just you and God face to face.

255
00:19:22.926 --> 00:19:25.829
So you two are...

256
00:19:25.863 --> 00:19:26.932
God's workers.

257
00:19:26.964 --> 00:19:28.399
Angels.

258
00:19:28.432 --> 00:19:29.567
You could say that.

259
00:19:35.306 --> 00:19:38.509
I've meditated on the
banks of the Ganges.

260
00:19:38.542 --> 00:19:40.811
I got naked with
Digambara Monks.

261
00:19:42.012 --> 00:19:45.884
I was audited by a
operating thetan.

262
00:19:46.617 --> 00:19:50.221
I drank Ayahuasca with
a Brazilian shaman

263
00:19:50.255 --> 00:19:55.227
all in an attempt to
get some response.

264
00:19:57.494 --> 00:19:58.930
Nothing. silence.

265
00:20:00.897 --> 00:20:03.367
Now you two show up at my door

266
00:20:03.401 --> 00:20:08.307
and tell me all of a sudden
God wants to talk to me

267
00:20:09.273 --> 00:20:10.908
face to face just like that?

268
00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:13.410
Just like that.

269
00:20:19.616 --> 00:20:22.287
Where would that happen?

270
00:20:24.355 --> 00:20:26.724
Right here in your home.

271
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.463
Look. the front
door's over there.

272
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.667
As angels you might
wanna fly out.

273
00:20:36.701 --> 00:20:38.502
There is a skylight
in the kitchen.

274
00:20:43.607 --> 00:20:46.611
Mr. Elwood. we
would like to stay in touch.

275
00:20:47.578 --> 00:20:51.649
God is waiting in case
you change your mind.

276
00:21:45.603 --> 00:21:47.372
We just walked
away from an easy 20 grand.

277
00:21:47.404 --> 00:21:48.807
I thought it was
the smarter choice.

278
00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:49.807
The smarter choice?

279
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.609
I was thinking about that safe.

280
00:21:54.912 --> 00:21:56.013
He's unbanked. all right?

281
00:21:56.047 --> 00:21:59.584
So I mean he had to have
gotten that 20.000 from a safe.

282
00:22:01.786 --> 00:22:03.555
Doesn't matter now anyway.

283
00:22:03.587 --> 00:22:04.788
This was a stupid lead.

284
00:22:04.821 --> 00:22:06.301
I mean just a waste
of time and money.

285
00:22:11.095 --> 00:22:12.095
Hello?

286
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:15.634
Yes. of course.

287
00:22:18.403 --> 00:22:19.971
Sorry. ah. where did you say?

288
00:22:21.905 --> 00:22:25.609
Yes. I'm positive we
can make that happen.

289
00:22:27.545 --> 00:22:30.515
Okay. yes. see you then.

290
00:22:32.884 --> 00:22:33.884
What'd he say?

291
00:22:34.852 --> 00:22:35.653
He wants a meeting.

292
00:22:35.685 --> 00:22:36.685
No way.

293
00:22:37.954 --> 00:22:41.692
Yeah. Tuesday. 10 a.m..
rooftop at Hotel Alessandra.

294
00:22:43.059 --> 00:22:44.863
I can't believe it.

295
00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:47.766
What do we do now?

296
00:22:48.833 --> 00:22:49.968
We gotta find God.

297
00:22:57.974 --> 00:23:02.045
All right. next up it'll be
couples skate. ladies choice.

298
00:23:02.078 --> 00:23:03.481
Don't be shy.

299
00:23:14.157 --> 00:23:17.861
I'll be. boys and girls.
look who just walked in.

300
00:23:17.894 --> 00:23:21.766
the king and queen of Franks's
Roller Rink have returned.

301
00:23:21.798 --> 00:23:23.032
Micah's record still stands.

302
00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:26.771
Lysoling 122 pairs of
skates in 32 seconds.

303
00:23:26.804 --> 00:23:29.974
and who could forget Rachel's
amazing blind double lutz.

304
00:23:30.007 --> 00:23:31.009
Still uncontested.

305
00:23:32.876 --> 00:23:36.079
Jesus.

306
00:23:36.113 --> 00:23:37.081
Hey. Frank.

307
00:23:37.114 --> 00:23:38.482
Hey.

308
00:23:39.517 --> 00:23:40.684
Hola. Jesus.

309
00:23:40.718 --> 00:23:43.086
Hola. Rachel. Micah.

310
00:23:46.857 --> 00:23:48.091
Stupid slushie machine.

311
00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:49.136
Can never stay on top of it.

312
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.894
Still got Jesus. huh?

313
00:23:50.928 --> 00:23:54.732
Oh yeah. oh. he ran the
place when I was away.

314
00:23:54.765 --> 00:23:56.067
The profits went up 20%.

315
00:23:56.099 --> 00:23:58.002
The guy is very resourceful.

316
00:23:59.135 --> 00:24:01.172
We should've visited you.

317
00:24:01.204 --> 00:24:03.008
Nah. it's. that's. that's fine.

318
00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:07.211
So. what do I owe
this lovely surprise?

319
00:24:08.179 --> 00:24:09.080
Um.

320
00:24:09.113 --> 00:24:11.482
Could we talk in the back?

321
00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:14.052
Look. you know I'm. I'm
on the square now. right?

322
00:24:14.852 --> 00:24:17.221
We need to talk
to you about God.

323
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.759
Oh no. oh. I was afraid of this.

324
00:24:22.792 --> 00:24:27.798
Who got ya. Jehovah's Witnesses.
bicycle guys. Scientology?

325
00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:32.871
Well. tell us what you think?

326
00:24:36.773 --> 00:24:37.975
Say something.

327
00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:40.111
I have no words.

328
00:24:40.144 --> 00:24:42.046
Look. we know it's not sane.

329
00:24:42.078 --> 00:24:43.714
Yeah. a meeting with God.

330
00:24:43.748 --> 00:24:45.583
It's ambitious.

331
00:24:45.615 --> 00:24:49.186
No. no. Kansas
City. the Finkel job.

332
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.588
Boise. they were ambitious.

333
00:24:51.622 --> 00:24:54.659
This is professionally
speaking. bonkers.

334
00:24:55.926 --> 00:24:57.628
We need you. Frank.

335
00:24:57.662 --> 00:24:59.230
I'm not going back to prison.

336
00:25:00.798 --> 00:25:02.232
It was nice seeing you guys.

337
00:25:02.266 --> 00:25:04.067
Enjoy a skate on the
house before you leave.

338
00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:05.270
It's lucrative.

339
00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:06.872
Yeah. well. it always is.

340
00:25:09.673 --> 00:25:11.608
Come on. Frank. throw us a bone.

341
00:25:11.642 --> 00:25:13.244
We're in over our heads.

342
00:25:13.277 --> 00:25:14.645
Well. guys. I'm sorry.

343
00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:16.281
I'm. I'm not interested.

344
00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:17.949
I'm clean as a whistle.

345
00:25:17.981 --> 00:25:20.519
Wait. we didn't even tell
you the best part. okay?

346
00:25:23.054 --> 00:25:24.054
He's unbanked.

347
00:25:25.655 --> 00:25:27.057
Hmm.

348
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.091
That's mean...

349
00:25:28.125 --> 00:25:29.227
I know what it means.

350
00:25:29.259 --> 00:25:30.595
He's got a safe.

351
00:25:30.627 --> 00:25:32.029
He's got a safe you say.

352
00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:32.931
Yeah.

353
00:25:32.963 --> 00:25:33.764
And you've seen it?

354
00:25:33.798 --> 00:25:35.032
No. we have not.

355
00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:38.269
Well. okay. not exactly.

356
00:25:38.301 --> 00:25:40.203
but we think we
know where it is.

357
00:25:40.237 --> 00:25:41.773
Guys. I
don't know the first thing

358
00:25:41.806 --> 00:25:43.040
about breaking into a safe.

359
00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:44.275
How hard can it be?

360
00:25:44.307 --> 00:25:45.876
If it wasn't it
wouldn't be a safe.

361
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.211
Oh. really?

362
00:25:47.243 --> 00:25:48.245
Yeah.

363
00:25:48.278 --> 00:25:49.681
Thank you.

364
00:25:49.713 --> 00:25:50.924
You're the one who
said it wouldn't be hard.

365
00:25:50.948 --> 00:25:52.158
Guys. guys. it's
nice to see you two

366
00:25:52.182 --> 00:25:54.285
getting along so well.

367
00:25:54.317 --> 00:25:56.186
Now as fun as this
sounds. I'm out.

368
00:26:00.324 --> 00:26:01.125
Well. it was good seeing you.

369
00:26:01.157 --> 00:26:02.961
Yeah. you too. come anytime.

370
00:26:05.229 --> 00:26:06.998
Missing out. old man.

371
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.030
Maybe.

372
00:26:19.276 --> 00:26:21.144
How long do you give him?

373
00:26:21.178 --> 00:26:23.949
Mm. 30. 40 seconds.

374
00:26:28.085 --> 00:26:29.587
You don't good. Frankie boy.

375
00:26:32.288 --> 00:26:35.660
Uh oh. uh oh. better
get out. move out of the way.

376
00:26:35.692 --> 00:26:37.996
Watch out. watch out. watch out.

377
00:26:38.028 --> 00:26:39.730
Oh God. come here.
sweetie. come here.

378
00:26:39.763 --> 00:26:41.031
I'll help you. come here.

379
00:26:41.065 --> 00:26:42.166
Everyone. watch out!

380
00:26:43.233 --> 00:26:44.234
Clean it up!

381
00:26:47.238 --> 00:26:48.273
Hey!

382
00:26:51.976 --> 00:26:54.278
This doesn't involve
national parks. public pools.

383
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.980
or the state of
Florida. does it?

384
00:26:56.012 --> 00:26:58.316
What. ah. no.

385
00:26:59.083 --> 00:27:02.220
When's the first meeting?

386
00:27:03.153 --> 00:27:05.355
May I ask what's the occasion?

387
00:27:05.388 --> 00:27:07.391
Well. they say dress
for the job you want.

388
00:27:08.792 --> 00:27:10.894
Is a custom
suit really necessary?

389
00:27:10.928 --> 00:27:12.363
Dear child. you need not worry.

390
00:27:12.395 --> 00:27:13.439
For I have the whole world...

391
00:27:13.463 --> 00:27:14.698
Hold still just for a second.

392
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:16.033
Look. Frank. um.

393
00:27:17.035 --> 00:27:18.745
I think I'm gonna have to
agree with Micah on this one.

394
00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:21.838
Who taught you
everything you know?

395
00:27:21.872 --> 00:27:23.807
Now. repeat after me. in Frank.

396
00:27:25.409 --> 00:27:27.245
In Frank.

397
00:27:27.278 --> 00:27:28.913
I trust.

398
00:27:28.945 --> 00:27:30.380
I trust.

399
00:27:30.413 --> 00:27:32.850
I trust.

400
00:27:34.484 --> 00:27:37.788
Says here he sold
his tech company in 2007

401
00:27:37.821 --> 00:27:40.023
for just over 500 million.

402
00:27:40.057 --> 00:27:41.759
Started from the ground up.

403
00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:43.260
Self-made man like me.

404
00:27:43.294 --> 00:27:46.864
After that there's not much.

405
00:27:46.896 --> 00:27:49.000
What was his demeanor
when you met him?

406
00:27:49.032 --> 00:27:49.833
Mental.

407
00:27:49.866 --> 00:27:51.802
Gee. well. obviously.

408
00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:54.005
Otherwise he wouldn't be
going along with this.

409
00:27:54.038 --> 00:27:55.940
Maybe there's more to
this guy than you think.

410
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.775
Any art in the house?

411
00:27:57.807 --> 00:27:58.776
He's got a La Roche.

412
00:27:58.808 --> 00:27:59.410
He's got good taste.

413
00:27:59.442 --> 00:28:01.311
That's always dangerous.

414
00:28:01.345 --> 00:28:02.779
Don't get me wrong.

415
00:28:02.813 --> 00:28:04.482
It's a big house.
but not that big.

416
00:28:04.515 --> 00:28:06.317
Conservative buy in my opinion.

417
00:28:06.349 --> 00:28:07.150
And the wife?

418
00:28:07.183 --> 00:28:08.985
Ah. divorced.

419
00:28:09.019 --> 00:28:09.953
That happens.

420
00:28:09.987 --> 00:28:10.788
What happens?

421
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.423
Grief causes divorce.

422
00:28:12.455 --> 00:28:15.459
My second wife left me when
our Shih Tzu. Dottie. died.

423
00:28:17.027 --> 00:28:18.096
Man. I miss that dog.

424
00:28:20.263 --> 00:28:21.431
Why here?

425
00:28:21.464 --> 00:28:23.201
No idea.

426
00:28:23.233 --> 00:28:25.202
Did you guys ever
go to Sunday school?

427
00:28:25.236 --> 00:28:26.437
No.

428
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.271
Just wanna see what I
got to work with here.

429
00:28:28.305 --> 00:28:29.907
You?

430
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.077
10 years of Catholic school
till they kicked me out at 15.

431
00:28:34.111 --> 00:28:38.082
Expelled. excommunicated. and
one other ex I can't remember.

432
00:28:38.115 --> 00:28:38.915
Wow.

433
00:28:38.949 --> 00:28:39.949
She was worth it.

434
00:28:41.317 --> 00:28:43.887
This is definitely a challenge.

435
00:28:43.921 --> 00:28:45.423
Would take a lot
for me to believe

436
00:28:45.455 --> 00:28:48.225
I was sitting across from
the creator of the universe.

437
00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:50.260
We're gonna have to get
him under the ether.

438
00:28:50.294 --> 00:28:51.763
Elicit an emotional response.

439
00:28:51.796 --> 00:28:53.297
Make him believe.

440
00:28:53.329 --> 00:28:55.465
Yeah. but this is insanity.

441
00:28:55.499 --> 00:28:58.336
Really. have you
ever read the Bible?

442
00:28:58.368 --> 00:29:01.204
It's chock full of what
you'd call insanity.

443
00:29:01.238 --> 00:29:03.875
People turning into
salt. talking donkeys.

444
00:29:03.907 --> 00:29:06.510
channeling of spirits. people
coming back from the dead.

445
00:29:06.544 --> 00:29:07.945
Channeling of spirits.

446
00:29:07.978 --> 00:29:09.447
Sounds like you know a lot.

447
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.049
And so should you
if we're gonna pull this off.

448
00:29:13.317 --> 00:29:14.786
Good Morgan Freeman. huh?

449
00:29:14.818 --> 00:29:18.388
Nah. cliche. something
more classic like Heston.

450
00:29:18.422 --> 00:29:20.324
He played Moses. not God.

451
00:29:20.356 --> 00:29:23.795
Oh. right. oh.
George Burns then.

452
00:29:23.827 --> 00:29:25.462
Why does it have to be a man?

453
00:29:25.496 --> 00:29:29.467
Good point. well. God
is everything. everywhere.

454
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.402
In the wind. in the
trees. in music.

455
00:29:31.434 --> 00:29:33.171
Right. but how are
we gonna do that?

456
00:29:33.203 --> 00:29:34.305
We gotta stay practical.

457
00:29:34.338 --> 00:29:38.341
The character of God. he
subscribes to the ooh theory.

458
00:29:38.375 --> 00:29:41.412
Omniscient.
omnipresent. omnipotent.

459
00:29:42.311 --> 00:29:45.182
Well. he's all powerful.
dogmatic. opulent.

460
00:29:45.215 --> 00:29:48.318
Smart. and always
10 steps ahead.

461
00:29:48.352 --> 00:29:49.253
Yeah. but a good listener.

462
00:29:49.286 --> 00:29:50.520
He's empathetic.

463
00:29:50.554 --> 00:29:52.523
Of course. we don't
have to give him

464
00:29:52.556 --> 00:29:55.526
the God of the Bible
or the Quran or Oprah.

465
00:29:55.558 --> 00:29:58.863
We just need to give
him the God he wants.

466
00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:05.170
This just might work.

467
00:30:32.896 --> 00:30:34.499
How can you not
feel for this guy?

468
00:30:37.166 --> 00:30:42.005
Yeah. sure. ah. it's
very tragic. whatever.

469
00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:47.577
I don't know.

470
00:30:47.611 --> 00:30:50.348
I don't go around begging
for attention. you know?

471
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:53.484
Whining about things
that have happened to me.

472
00:30:55.051 --> 00:30:56.286
The world burns everyone.

473
00:30:57.421 --> 00:31:01.226
Life sucks and nothing
really matters.

474
00:31:03.227 --> 00:31:06.264
Well. actually. there's one
thing that matters. money.

475
00:31:08.097 --> 00:31:09.097
You know why?

476
00:31:10.099 --> 00:31:12.569
Because money
creates opportunity.

477
00:31:12.603 --> 00:31:13.638
Exactly.

478
00:31:21.644 --> 00:31:24.214
Have you ever wondered
what it would've been like

479
00:31:24.248 --> 00:31:26.985
to actually have a dad?

480
00:31:28.618 --> 00:31:30.554
You know. how things
would've turned out for us?

481
00:31:34.057 --> 00:31:36.126
You'd be a rock star.

482
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.197
I'd manage a billion
dollar hedge fund.

483
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:46.604
Where you going?

484
00:31:46.636 --> 00:31:48.940
I'm just gonna clear
my head before tomorrow.

485
00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.375
Don't stay out too late.

486
00:31:52.409 --> 00:31:53.409
Okay. Dad.

487
00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.718
He was literally sitting
right there. two seats from me.

488
00:33:08.751 --> 00:33:09.653
Did you talk to him?

489
00:33:09.685 --> 00:33:11.221
No. he didn't talk to him.

490
00:33:11.255 --> 00:33:12.723
You don't. you
don't talk to him.

491
00:33:12.756 --> 00:33:14.767
You don't go up to McCartney
and interrupt his dinner.

492
00:33:14.791 --> 00:33:16.659
Oh. you should've
went up to him and gone.

493
00:33:16.692 --> 00:33:19.163
are you the lead
singer of Wings?

494
00:33:19.195 --> 00:33:20.195
Right?

495
00:33:22.432 --> 00:33:24.167
It's The Beatles.

496
00:33:24.201 --> 00:33:25.403
Oh my gosh. babe.

497
00:33:25.435 --> 00:33:27.504
That's okay. you're right.

498
00:33:27.538 --> 00:33:28.372
Oh. you're cute though.

499
00:33:28.404 --> 00:33:29.373
Is there another band?

500
00:33:29.405 --> 00:33:30.307
Yes. another band.

501
00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:31.274
Am I dumb?

502
00:33:31.307 --> 00:33:32.742
No.

503
00:33:32.776 --> 00:33:34.420
No. you're. you're.
it's okay. it's all right.

504
00:33:34.444 --> 00:33:36.614
Well. thanks for coming tonight.

505
00:33:36.646 --> 00:33:39.049
That was really cool
to see you out there.

506
00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:40.651
Of course. you
guys were awesome.

507
00:33:40.683 --> 00:33:43.354
Just needed a night out.

508
00:33:43.386 --> 00:33:44.587
I hope the money helps.

509
00:33:44.621 --> 00:33:48.826
Oh yeah. yes. thank
you. super generous.

510
00:33:48.858 --> 00:33:50.660
Of course.

511
00:34:16.253 --> 00:34:17.555
You're late.

512
00:34:17.588 --> 00:34:18.756
Yeah. like a minute.

513
00:34:18.789 --> 00:34:20.724
I need you all in.

514
00:34:20.757 --> 00:34:21.826
I'm here. aren't I?

515
00:34:24.894 --> 00:34:26.262
Where'd you go last night?

516
00:34:26.295 --> 00:34:27.731
Just walked around.

517
00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.400
Right.

518
00:34:33.369 --> 00:34:34.369
Here.

519
00:34:35.806 --> 00:34:37.508
Put this in your ear.

520
00:34:39.309 --> 00:34:40.311
How's that feel?

521
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.112
Good.

522
00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:43.547
Hello. Rachel.

523
00:34:43.579 --> 00:34:44.579
Frank?

524
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:47.650
Frank.

525
00:34:47.684 --> 00:34:50.221
He wants to go by.

526
00:34:50.253 --> 00:34:51.154
Oh. God.

527
00:34:51.188 --> 00:34:53.324
Do not use my name in vain.

528
00:34:53.356 --> 00:34:55.326
Good one. how you feeling?

529
00:34:56.492 --> 00:34:57.503
I'm the creator of the universe.

530
00:34:57.527 --> 00:34:58.328
How do you think I feel?

531
00:34:58.362 --> 00:35:00.331
Mm. nervous?

532
00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:01.432
And a little gassy.

533
00:35:04.568 --> 00:35:05.568
It's time.

534
00:35:31.527 --> 00:35:32.529
He's up there?

535
00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:34.931
Please follow us.

536
00:35:59.255 --> 00:36:00.456
I miss the white suits.

537
00:36:00.489 --> 00:36:02.926
That was. that was a good touch.

538
00:36:06.362 --> 00:36:11.368
Okay. this is gonna be good.

539
00:36:13.936 --> 00:36:15.472
I hope he's in a good mood.

540
00:36:17.273 --> 00:36:19.409
It's nice of him to
make time in his day.

541
00:36:38.862 --> 00:36:39.896
Right.

542
00:36:54.543 --> 00:36:55.746
Eagle's left the nest.

543
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:35.650
Ben.

544
00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:42.860
Not what you were expecting.

545
00:37:47.364 --> 00:37:48.364
Have a seat.

546
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.478
What if I don't want to?

547
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:02.612
A free will man.

548
00:38:02.646 --> 00:38:03.646
I like it.

549
00:38:08.751 --> 00:38:10.954
So you're God.

550
00:38:10.987 --> 00:38:12.023
That's right.

551
00:38:13.422 --> 00:38:14.422
Which one?

552
00:38:15.625 --> 00:38:16.625
There's only one.

553
00:38:21.864 --> 00:38:23.933
What am I thinking right now?

554
00:38:23.967 --> 00:38:24.967
That I'm not God.

555
00:38:28.538 --> 00:38:30.606
All right. that was a layup.

556
00:38:30.639 --> 00:38:35.645
That ah. what did I
have for breakfast?

557
00:38:36.512 --> 00:38:37.748
I don't like to be tested.

558
00:38:40.016 --> 00:38:41.418
That's what I thought.

559
00:38:43.052 --> 00:38:47.958
You were born on October
11th. 1971 at 4:32 a.m.

560
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:50.693
You have a birthmark on
your left butt cheek.

561
00:38:50.726 --> 00:38:53.396
and a mole on your back
you should get looked at.

562
00:38:53.429 --> 00:38:55.898
Your Aunt Regina's
dog is named Cuddles.

563
00:38:55.931 --> 00:38:58.468
and this morning you
had two pieces of bacon.

564
00:38:58.501 --> 00:39:01.971
expired yogurt. and a
generous pour of bourbon.

565
00:39:02.005 --> 00:39:05.376
So do you wanna
keep playing games.

566
00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:07.111
or get to the real
reason we're here?

567
00:39:09.179 --> 00:39:11.414
I know the number of
hairs on your head. Ben.

568
00:39:11.447 --> 00:39:14.050
Stop worrying and
know that you're worth

569
00:39:14.083 --> 00:39:15.985
more than many sparrows.

570
00:39:22.425 --> 00:39:24.795
You've been looking for
me for a long time now.

571
00:39:26.195 --> 00:39:27.195
Sure.

572
00:39:30.065 --> 00:39:32.034
So what's this
really gonna cost me?

573
00:39:32.068 --> 00:39:34.672
I think they told you I
had no need of your money.

574
00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:36.740
But you're after something.

575
00:39:36.773 --> 00:39:38.041
I'm only after the truth.

576
00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:42.445
Makes two of us.

577
00:39:44.213 --> 00:39:45.213
Ask me.

578
00:39:45.981 --> 00:39:47.184
Ask you what?

579
00:39:47.217 --> 00:39:49.420
Ask me what you
came here to ask me.

580
00:39:51.086 --> 00:39:53.090
You wanna know why
your daughter died.

581
00:39:56.092 --> 00:39:57.094
Her name was Katie.

582
00:40:04.134 --> 00:40:06.771
You're either weak
or you're cruel.

583
00:40:08.103 --> 00:40:09.139
Which one is it.

584
00:40:10.172 --> 00:40:11.607
I can't answer that question.

585
00:40:11.641 --> 00:40:12.543
Why not?

586
00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:13.686
Because I'm neither of those.

587
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.012
Well. it's one or the other.

588
00:40:16.179 --> 00:40:17.247
What makes you think that?

589
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.784
Because you're either unable
to do anything about it.

590
00:40:20.983 --> 00:40:23.052
or you just don't
care. maybe both.

591
00:40:26.222 --> 00:40:28.759
I find your lack
of faith disturbing.

592
00:40:28.791 --> 00:40:30.427
Keep to the script. Frank.

593
00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.099
You still haven't
asked the real question.

594
00:40:37.132 --> 00:40:39.669
That potent three
letter word. why.

595
00:40:39.702 --> 00:40:42.206
Because you're not gonna give
me the real answer. are you?

596
00:40:44.773 --> 00:40:46.543
You enjoy watching
people suffer.

597
00:40:48.677 --> 00:40:49.679
That's it. isn't it?

598
00:40:51.081 --> 00:40:53.684
You're just some glorified
celestial psychopath.

599
00:40:54.751 --> 00:40:55.751
You're not good.

600
00:40:57.086 --> 00:41:01.090
If you're good. stop me
from jumping off the roof.

601
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:08.231
We have a situation here.

602
00:41:08.264 --> 00:41:09.766
Eagle wants to fly.

603
00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:16.539
Come on!

604
00:41:18.807 --> 00:41:20.210
Let the coward fly.

605
00:41:20.242 --> 00:41:21.043
What?

606
00:41:21.077 --> 00:41:21.912
Say what?

607
00:41:21.945 --> 00:41:22.846
That's great.

608
00:41:22.878 --> 00:41:24.047
Frank. stop him.

609
00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:30.621
Ben. here's the thing.

610
00:41:32.054 --> 00:41:33.222
I'm not gonna stop you

611
00:41:33.255 --> 00:41:35.125
from throwing yourself
off this rooftop.

612
00:41:36.992 --> 00:41:38.094
Frank. stop him.

613
00:41:41.231 --> 00:41:42.233
It's your choice.

614
00:41:44.233 --> 00:41:46.971
but I think we have more
to talk about. don't you?

615
00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:01.819
Can we meet again?

616
00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.690
Sure. but on my conditions.

617
00:42:06.722 --> 00:42:09.226
We meet at your house
away from high places.

618
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:15.931
That's fine.

619
00:42:52.302 --> 00:42:53.871
I'll be in touch.

620
00:42:59.009 --> 00:43:00.009
Really?

621
00:43:00.943 --> 00:43:02.179
What's wrong?

622
00:43:02.211 --> 00:43:03.254
You were gonna let him jump.

623
00:43:03.278 --> 00:43:04.815
Come on. was not.

624
00:43:06.181 --> 00:43:07.384
Uh. there's a difference

625
00:43:07.416 --> 00:43:10.186
between killing someone
and robbing someone.

626
00:43:10.219 --> 00:43:11.320
He was gonna jump.

627
00:43:11.353 --> 00:43:12.355
I wasn't gonna kill him.

628
00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:15.692
Can we take a moment to admire

629
00:43:15.724 --> 00:43:17.326
what I just accomplished here?

630
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.094
And what was that. Frank?

631
00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:20.063
We're in the house. that's what.

632
00:43:20.096 --> 00:43:23.967
Yes. but did you notice
the mastery. hmm. the wit.

633
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.969
the waxing of the philosophical?

634
00:43:27.003 --> 00:43:28.939
I'm God. he bought it.

635
00:43:28.972 --> 00:43:30.107
Whatever you say. Frank.

636
00:43:30.139 --> 00:43:31.307
We got another meeting.

637
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.385
The guy almost killed himself.

638
00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:35.211
Well. the man is
in a fragile state.

639
00:43:35.244 --> 00:43:36.279
Trust me. we're golden.

640
00:43:37.914 --> 00:43:40.083
Hey. where you going?

641
00:43:40.115 --> 00:43:41.251
Let her go.

642
00:43:41.284 --> 00:43:43.253
Let her decompress.

643
00:43:43.286 --> 00:43:45.389
Sometimes my presence
is overwhelming.

644
00:43:47.757 --> 00:43:48.757
There he is.

645
00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:16.853
Hello?

646
00:44:16.885 --> 00:44:18.755
You asleep?

647
00:44:18.788 --> 00:44:20.690
No. I'm pregnant.

648
00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:24.294
Um. well. I was wondering

649
00:44:24.327 --> 00:44:26.396
if I could maybe come over.

650
00:44:26.429 --> 00:44:30.067
Ah. sure. yeah.
that would be great.

651
00:44:30.099 --> 00:44:32.469
I mean I can't
really sleep anyway.

652
00:44:32.501 --> 00:44:34.141
Owen made some homemade
ice cream earlier.

653
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:35.170
I know you want it.

654
00:44:36.072 --> 00:44:39.175
Cool. I'll
um. I'll see you soon.

655
00:44:40.143 --> 00:44:41.144
See you soon.

656
00:44:41.177 --> 00:44:42.177
Okay.

657
00:44:48.284 --> 00:44:53.456
So. the house was always
really strict and religious.

658
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:56.893
For example. we could sing.

659
00:44:56.925 --> 00:44:58.894
but we couldn't
play instruments.

660
00:44:58.927 --> 00:44:59.730
What?

661
00:44:59.762 --> 00:45:00.797
That was a sin.

662
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:01.731
Oh.

663
00:45:01.764 --> 00:45:03.400
So. I would go to my Nana's.

664
00:45:03.432 --> 00:45:04.867
and I would sneak
into the basement.

665
00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.404
and she had this
sick old Steinway.

666
00:45:08.438 --> 00:45:10.440
and a bunch of the
keys were out of tune.

667
00:45:10.472 --> 00:45:13.275
but that is where
I learned to play.

668
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:16.346
and that's where I wrote
all my first songs.

669
00:45:16.378 --> 00:45:17.456
Gonna need to hear
all those songs.

670
00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.416
Oh. dude. I was 10.

671
00:45:20.449 --> 00:45:22.251
They're the worst
songs ever written.

672
00:45:22.284 --> 00:45:24.253
Exactly. that's
why I wanna hear them.

673
00:45:24.286 --> 00:45:26.088
So anyway. for our anniversary.

674
00:45:26.121 --> 00:45:30.193
Owen went to Mississippi
in a U-Haul truck.

675
00:45:31.494 --> 00:45:33.731
went to my Nana's house
and got the Steinway.

676
00:45:34.864 --> 00:45:36.066
And now I have it here.

677
00:45:36.099 --> 00:45:38.302
Still out of tune. but
I love it that way.

678
00:45:40.503 --> 00:45:41.739
Man. your life is nice.

679
00:45:44.873 --> 00:45:49.879
You and Owen and your music
and this house. the baby.

680
00:46:00.222 --> 00:46:01.759
This is my third pregnancy.

681
00:46:03.358 --> 00:46:07.364
The first one we
lost super early.

682
00:46:09.331 --> 00:46:10.331
which was hard.

683
00:46:11.333 --> 00:46:16.472
And then the second one. I
delivered him at 35 weeks.

684
00:46:19.474 --> 00:46:21.177
A stillborn baby boy.

685
00:46:23.478 --> 00:46:24.478
His name was Ethan.

686
00:46:30.353 --> 00:46:33.856
I'm realizing now I haven't
even said his name in so long.

687
00:46:36.025 --> 00:46:38.961
I'm sorry. I. I
didn't mean to...

688
00:46:46.068 --> 00:46:47.068
Your turn.

689
00:46:48.137 --> 00:46:49.172
What?

690
00:46:49.204 --> 00:46:51.375
You're not exactly an
open book. Emily.

691
00:46:53.543 --> 00:46:54.543
Um.

692
00:46:56.512 --> 00:46:57.548
Come on.

693
00:47:00.516 --> 00:47:01.818
Got a twin brother.

694
00:47:04.387 --> 00:47:07.391
Really. how do I not know that?

695
00:47:09.157 --> 00:47:10.460
And um.

696
00:47:17.199 --> 00:47:18.568
my dad bailed when I was two.

697
00:47:24.539 --> 00:47:25.875
I don't even know his name.

698
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:37.086
And um. lost my mom
when I was eight.

699
00:47:42.291 --> 00:47:46.262
I found her on the
bathroom floor.

700
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.135
I tried waking her up.

701
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:56.271
She wouldn't.

702
00:48:00.208 --> 00:48:01.344
She didn't want to.

703
00:48:07.416 --> 00:48:08.552
She didn't want us.

704
00:48:15.257 --> 00:48:16.359
It broke my brother.

705
00:48:22.431 --> 00:48:23.532
So I had to be strong.

706
00:48:34.577 --> 00:48:36.446
I did what I had to to survive.

707
00:48:44.554 --> 00:48:46.023
I'm so sorry.

708
00:50:06.202 --> 00:50:08.104
What're you doing here?

709
00:50:08.137 --> 00:50:09.606
Do. do you have any coffee.

710
00:50:10.405 --> 00:50:13.110
or maybe something
a little stronger?

711
00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.129
I have to be honest.

712
00:50:33.262 --> 00:50:37.601
I'm very intrigued
by your line of work.

713
00:50:38.701 --> 00:50:40.336
Get your hands dirty.

714
00:50:42.704 --> 00:50:44.507
I like that.

715
00:50:45.608 --> 00:50:46.743
I got coffee.

716
00:50:48.677 --> 00:50:49.746
Micah.

717
00:50:50.679 --> 00:50:51.647
What're you doing here?

718
00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:52.682
I changed my mind.

719
00:50:52.715 --> 00:50:54.451
Changed your mind about what?

720
00:50:55.684 --> 00:50:56.719
Our deal.

721
00:50:58.753 --> 00:51:01.458
Something's come up and I
need my money in 48 hours.

722
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:02.525
I hope that's okay.

723
00:51:03.626 --> 00:51:04.427
You can't do this.

724
00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.762
We had a deal.

725
00:51:05.795 --> 00:51:08.597
We're close. just give us
till the end of the week.

726
00:51:17.907 --> 00:51:20.309
I want my money.

727
00:51:50.239 --> 00:51:52.342
Sorry. I thought I
left this unlocked.

728
00:51:53.608 --> 00:51:54.608
Do you live here?

729
00:51:55.677 --> 00:51:57.646
No. of course not. come on.

730
00:52:01.784 --> 00:52:02.818
Coffee?

731
00:52:02.851 --> 00:52:03.853
I'm good.

732
00:52:07.757 --> 00:52:09.858
Blueprints to the mansion.

733
00:52:09.891 --> 00:52:10.893
Wow.

734
00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:12.562
So what're we looking at?

735
00:52:12.594 --> 00:52:14.230
Well. this is
where we think the safe is.

736
00:52:14.262 --> 00:52:16.865
Hmm. all right. we gotta find
out what kind of safe it is.

737
00:52:16.898 --> 00:52:20.702
combination. key.
fingerprint. rectal scan.

738
00:52:20.735 --> 00:52:22.571
You mean retina scan.

739
00:52:22.605 --> 00:52:23.806
What'd I say?

740
00:52:23.838 --> 00:52:25.741
Either way. it's
gotta be high-tech.

741
00:52:25.775 --> 00:52:28.545
Yeah. yeah. we gotta find
out the make and model.

742
00:52:28.577 --> 00:52:31.380
and ah. any clues as to
how to open the thing.

743
00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:32.382
And a third meeting.

744
00:52:32.414 --> 00:52:33.315
Yeah.

745
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:35.218
Right. gotta up my God game.

746
00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:37.461
I think we should do a
reconnaissance mission.

747
00:52:37.485 --> 00:52:39.888
Yeah. scope the security out.

748
00:52:39.922 --> 00:52:42.257
Jesus. fire up the van. baby!

749
00:52:53.469 --> 00:52:55.938
Yeah. this message
is for Benjamin Elwood.

750
00:52:55.972 --> 00:52:58.274
City Power will be sending
out a trusted service provider

751
00:52:58.306 --> 00:53:00.275
this afternoon between
one and four p.m.

752
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:03.479
This is a routine check and
you do not need to be present.

753
00:53:03.512 --> 00:53:04.512
Have a nice day.

754
00:53:39.447 --> 00:53:41.283
What do you think that is?

755
00:53:41.317 --> 00:53:42.485
Oh. that's a tower.

756
00:53:42.518 --> 00:53:43.753
For what?

757
00:53:43.786 --> 00:53:45.887
Maybe he's trying to
build his way to God.

758
00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.591
Like I said. nuts.

759
00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.927
Well. I got give cameras so far.

760
00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.561
There's probably more. here.

761
00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.510
I wonder how much cash
he's got in that safe?

762
00:53:59.534 --> 00:54:01.670
Oh. cash is boring.

763
00:54:01.704 --> 00:54:03.806
Best to stay away
from legal tender.

764
00:54:03.838 --> 00:54:04.940
What. why?

765
00:54:04.974 --> 00:54:07.844
Well. it's sloppy. traceable.

766
00:54:07.876 --> 00:54:09.945
and frankly a little unsexy.

767
00:54:09.978 --> 00:54:12.414
Yeah. cash is so unsexy.

768
00:54:12.447 --> 00:54:14.384
Jesus did a little digging

769
00:54:14.416 --> 00:54:15.985
and Mr. Unbanked Elwood

770
00:54:16.018 --> 00:54:18.954
turns out to be a
rare coin collector.

771
00:54:18.987 --> 00:54:20.123
What. like buffalo nickels?

772
00:54:20.155 --> 00:54:24.994
No. like a 1343 Florin that's
worth a cool 6.8 million.

773
00:54:26.661 --> 00:54:27.864
He has that?

774
00:54:27.896 --> 00:54:29.041
Yeah. according
to auction records.

775
00:54:29.065 --> 00:54:32.367
he has that and dozens
more of the same ilk.

776
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.636
He's on the move.

777
00:55:01.764 --> 00:55:02.766
Well. that's weird.

778
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.869
Maybe he's hot.

779
00:55:07.536 --> 00:55:09.938
Grief makes people
do strange things.

780
00:56:11.833 --> 00:56:13.402
We should stop.

781
00:56:13.436 --> 00:56:14.704
What. why?

782
00:56:14.737 --> 00:56:15.972
I don't know.

783
00:56:16.005 --> 00:56:17.749
There's just something
about him makes me feel...

784
00:56:17.773 --> 00:56:21.744
Feel. you're
feelings aren't real.

785
00:56:21.777 --> 00:56:23.713
You wanna know what's
real. that safe.

786
00:56:23.746 --> 00:56:24.680
Hmm.

787
00:56:24.713 --> 00:56:25.748
What's in that safe.

788
00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.091
and how it can directly
impact our situation. right?

789
00:56:27.115 --> 00:56:28.617
Back me up here. Frank.

790
00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:31.987
I know it's hard. but we
can't stop at this point.

791
00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:33.056
Why not?

792
00:56:34.489 --> 00:56:37.959
Oh. you know. I
remember the first time

793
00:56:37.992 --> 00:56:40.063
that you walked into the rink.

794
00:56:41.063 --> 00:56:43.832
My third divorce had just
finalized and I was in a funk.

795
00:56:43.865 --> 00:56:46.802
and in walks the saddest looking
little girl I'd ever seen.

796
00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:50.006
One minute I'm helping
this poor child.

797
00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:53.209
and the next I find
the register empty.

798
00:56:54.976 --> 00:56:58.013
It was a special feeling
being conned by two children.

799
00:56:58.813 --> 00:57:01.150
I knew we'd do special
things together.

800
00:57:02.784 --> 00:57:04.085
And when they put me away.

801
00:57:04.119 --> 00:57:06.088
I thought I'd never
see you guys again.

802
00:57:06.956 --> 00:57:09.025
but you come walking
back into the rink.

803
00:57:09.057 --> 00:57:10.760
and we're getting the
band back together.

804
00:57:10.793 --> 00:57:11.894
Can't stop now.

805
00:57:13.161 --> 00:57:16.465
Besides. it's the
role of a lifetime.

806
00:57:29.644 --> 00:57:32.047
Hey. Em. ah. I
went in for a checkup.

807
00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:33.615
and everything's okay.

808
00:57:33.648 --> 00:57:35.484
but they decided to
just keep me here.

809
00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:38.521
So letting everyone know
we're gonna induce labor

810
00:57:38.554 --> 00:57:40.056
probably tomorrow
or the next day.

811
00:57:40.088 --> 00:57:44.092
Ah. feel free to come by
if you want to. room 202.

812
00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:11.621
Sorry. I'm late. where's Rachel?

813
00:58:11.653 --> 00:58:13.121
On her way down I hope.

814
00:58:13.155 --> 00:58:16.626
Hey. if things go sideways
here. good with the audible?

815
00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:19.195
Feels more
like a Hail Mary to me.

816
00:58:19.228 --> 00:58:21.097
It'll work. just gotta sell it.

817
00:58:50.626 --> 00:58:52.695
Good afternoon. Mr.
Elwood. how are you?

818
00:58:55.164 --> 00:58:56.165
He's in the back.

819
00:59:10.045 --> 00:59:11.947
It's beautiful. Ben.

820
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:12.981
Come. sit.

821
00:59:30.331 --> 00:59:31.232
I thought you said you wanted

822
00:59:31.266 --> 00:59:32.969
to stay away from high places.

823
00:59:40.141 --> 00:59:42.077
People get me all wrong.

824
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:43.346
How so?

825
00:59:43.378 --> 00:59:45.347
They don't think I can feel.

826
00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:48.317
They don't think I can
relate to pain and suffering.

827
00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:51.187
They might be on to something.

828
00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.398
You don't think I have
emotion like you do?

829
00:59:54.422 --> 00:59:55.890
I have no idea.

830
00:59:55.923 --> 00:59:57.259
I created you in my image.

831
00:59:59.894 --> 01:00:01.730
I think we look nothing alike.

832
01:00:07.835 --> 01:00:09.270
I've done horrible things.

833
01:00:09.304 --> 01:00:12.141
Every sin under the sun.

834
01:00:12.173 --> 01:00:14.677
and I have been punished
for it and that's okay.

835
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:16.144
I deserve it.

836
01:00:16.177 --> 01:00:19.214
But this new family. they
were my second chance.

837
01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:23.952
What you did to her was cruelty.

838
01:00:23.985 --> 01:00:26.221
That was cruelty beyond cruelty.

839
01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:28.057
You're not who
people think you are.

840
01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:30.159
You're a fraud.

841
01:00:35.396 --> 01:00:36.865
Are you familiar with Seurat?

842
01:00:38.233 --> 01:00:39.669
Think of this.

843
01:00:39.702 --> 01:00:42.271
Let's call it
theological pointillism.

844
01:00:42.304 --> 01:00:44.340
When you view his painting.

845
01:00:44.373 --> 01:00:48.144
A Sunday Afternoon on the Island
of La Grande Jatte closely.

846
01:00:49.344 --> 01:00:52.280
all you see is a mess
of spots and smudges.

847
01:00:52.313 --> 01:00:53.313
Doesn't make sense.

848
01:00:54.849 --> 01:00:56.318
But when you stand back 20 feet.

849
01:00:58.152 --> 01:01:03.091
you see a beautiful. ordered.
harmonious tapestry of art.

850
01:01:14.036 --> 01:01:18.007
If you look at life and
see spots and smudges.

851
01:01:19.407 --> 01:01:21.911
Perhaps you're presently
standing too close.

852
01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:25.247
But from a divine perspective.

853
01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.816
you'll see something beautiful.

854
01:01:29.451 --> 01:01:32.088
Frank. we're definitely
gonna need another meeting.

855
01:01:35.123 --> 01:01:36.358
1964.

856
01:01:39.961 --> 01:01:43.164
That's when the U.S. Mint
stop printing silver coins.

857
01:01:43.197 --> 01:01:47.804
I found this one on the
corner of 33rd and Broadway.

858
01:01:50.338 --> 01:01:51.807
It was right by a trashcan.

859
01:01:54.342 --> 01:01:56.244
I stopped to pick it up.

860
01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:57.879
My daughter didn't stop.

861
01:01:57.913 --> 01:01:59.248
She was hit by a box truck.

862
01:02:01.382 --> 01:02:02.317
And I held her in my arms

863
01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:04.454
while she was bleeding
out all over the street.

864
01:02:07.188 --> 01:02:08.790
Yeah. I'm taken this personally.

865
01:02:10.391 --> 01:02:14.797
Please spare me your
lectures on perspective.

866
01:02:16.431 --> 01:02:18.467
I'm sorry your daughter died.

867
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.869
No. you are sorry
for killing Katie!

868
01:02:20.902 --> 01:02:25.340
You are either everything
or you are nothing!

869
01:02:25.373 --> 01:02:26.274
Frank.

870
01:02:26.307 --> 01:02:27.143
Ben. we should meet again.

871
01:02:27.175 --> 01:02:28.210
No. we're done.

872
01:02:31.146 --> 01:02:32.248
Frank. go Hail Mary.

873
01:02:33.981 --> 01:02:35.317
I'll let you talk to her.

874
01:02:37.518 --> 01:02:38.518
What?

875
01:02:40.454 --> 01:02:43.491
I can let you talk to Katie.

876
01:02:49.931 --> 01:02:50.931
Rachel.

877
01:02:53.367 --> 01:02:54.402
Rachel.

878
01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:58.007
Come on. we're. we're sorry.

879
01:02:58.039 --> 01:02:59.942
We didn't tell you
about the backup plan.

880
01:02:59.974 --> 01:03:01.519
We didn't think it
was gonna come to this.

881
01:03:01.543 --> 01:03:03.077
Well. we hoped it wouldn't.

882
01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:04.012
Yeah.

883
01:03:04.045 --> 01:03:05.181
Talk to his dead daughter?

884
01:03:05.213 --> 01:03:06.081
This is a new low.

885
01:03:06.114 --> 01:03:07.316
Not to mention how.

886
01:03:08.617 --> 01:03:09.827
Micah. maybe
we should rethink...

887
01:03:09.851 --> 01:03:11.019
No. she's gonna do it.

888
01:03:11.052 --> 01:03:12.052
Do what?

889
01:03:14.021 --> 01:03:19.027
You're gonna have. have
to. um. play his daughter.

890
01:03:19.628 --> 01:03:20.429
What?

891
01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:22.097
Sorry. Rachel.

892
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:25.601
Well. it's I guess. she's
gonna speak through you. right?

893
01:03:25.634 --> 01:03:27.235
Yeah. like a medium.

894
01:03:27.268 --> 01:03:30.271
kind of a channeling or
spirit type of thing.

895
01:03:30.304 --> 01:03:31.440
Subtle.

896
01:03:31.472 --> 01:03:35.110
You know. I expected something
like this from you. Micah.

897
01:03:35.143 --> 01:03:36.177
but not you. Frank.

898
01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:37.111
Rachel.

899
01:03:37.144 --> 01:03:39.014
No. he doesn't deserve this.

900
01:03:39.047 --> 01:03:40.817
No one deserves this.

901
01:03:43.985 --> 01:03:47.455
I so know where you are.

902
01:03:47.489 --> 01:03:51.427
Hmm. hmm. why is this light on?

903
01:03:52.393 --> 01:03:56.298
How strange. is someone
hiding in the toilet?

904
01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.302
What's that giggling?

905
01:04:00.335 --> 01:04:01.503
What is that giggling?

906
01:04:01.536 --> 01:04:02.503
Who is that?

907
01:04:02.536 --> 01:04:03.972
Who could that be?

908
01:04:04.005 --> 01:04:05.005
Who could that be?

909
01:04:07.108 --> 01:04:09.110
You're it. you're it.
you're it. you're it!

910
01:04:17.052 --> 01:04:22.057
She has every toy.

911
01:04:27.295 --> 01:04:28.364
You got a new piano.

912
01:04:28.396 --> 01:04:31.333
and all you wanna do is run
around in the sprinklers?

913
01:04:31.365 --> 01:04:32.534
Uh huh.

914
01:04:32.567 --> 01:04:34.469
Uh huh. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah!

915
01:06:09.097 --> 01:06:10.199
Got extra egg rolls.

916
01:06:14.436 --> 01:06:15.637
What're you doing?

917
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:17.239
What's it look like I'm doing?

918
01:06:18.306 --> 01:06:19.307
What about Vaughn?

919
01:06:21.275 --> 01:06:22.677
Well. you can't just bail.

920
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:24.713
I can't do this anymore. Micah.

921
01:06:27.449 --> 01:06:31.019
Ah. is this about some
moral line we're crossing?

922
01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:34.155
When did you get so soft?

923
01:06:34.188 --> 01:06:35.623
When did you become so cruel?

924
01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.260
Hold on.

925
01:06:43.398 --> 01:06:44.398
Who do you think you are?

926
01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:48.704
Move.

927
01:06:48.737 --> 01:06:53.709
Face it. I'm the only one who
knows you. really knows you.

928
01:06:54.809 --> 01:06:56.144
And despite what you think.

929
01:06:56.177 --> 01:06:57.655
I'm the only one
that's protected you.

930
01:06:57.679 --> 01:07:00.548
The only person you've ever
looked out for was yourself.

931
01:07:03.717 --> 01:07:05.186
What's the real reason?

932
01:07:07.856 --> 01:07:08.856
Is it him?

933
01:07:10.224 --> 01:07:11.760
You think he deserves your pity?

934
01:07:13.094 --> 01:07:13.795
Move.

935
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:15.798
You can go in a second.

936
01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:17.800
First. I need to
tell you a story.

937
01:07:19.101 --> 01:07:19.802
Trust me. you're gonna like it.

938
01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.603
It's about a guy. right?

939
01:07:21.635 --> 01:07:23.771
A deadbeat. a drunk.

940
01:07:23.804 --> 01:07:27.076
who knocks up this crazy
bartender with twins.

941
01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.817
but he couldn't handle
it. so he split.

942
01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:36.751
Never to be seen again.

943
01:07:38.652 --> 01:07:43.558
The mother never tells
the twins who he is.

944
01:07:43.592 --> 01:07:48.164
because she's so twisted.

945
01:07:49.731 --> 01:07:51.667
Turns out she couldn't
handle it either.

946
01:07:52.634 --> 01:07:55.771
She downs a bottle of pills.

947
01:07:57.672 --> 01:08:00.675
and leaves them like
their father did.

948
01:08:00.708 --> 01:08:02.143
Stop.

949
01:08:02.177 --> 01:08:05.681
Mm mm. because this
is where it gets good.

950
01:08:07.748 --> 01:08:10.718
One of the twins
found the deadbeat.

951
01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:15.691
and not in some back alley.

952
01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:18.828
but as a new man. a changed man.

953
01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:26.467
Went to AA. got sober. went
to church and found God

954
01:08:26.501 --> 01:08:29.838
who blessed him with
a beautiful family.

955
01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:36.445
and then he sells his
company and gets filthy rich.

956
01:08:40.748 --> 01:08:46.822
but the unexpected
happened. tragedy struck.

957
01:08:48.422 --> 01:08:53.328
He loses it all. the wife
and the daughter. his God.

958
01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:18.787
Nice try. this is your best
yet. but I don't believe you.

959
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:23.526
I think you do.

960
01:09:27.295 --> 01:09:28.931
Not once did he grieve for us.

961
01:09:31.365 --> 01:09:35.503
You and I were nothing to him.

962
01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:41.777
He deserves everything he got!

963
01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:47.950
Mm hmm. and everything
he's got coming!

964
01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:55.517
Frank. did you know?

965
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:56.418
What?

966
01:10:56.451 --> 01:10:57.918
Did you know?

967
01:10:57.952 --> 01:10:58.954
Know what?

968
01:10:59.887 --> 01:11:00.889
Ben.

969
01:11:10.497 --> 01:11:15.003
Micah played us like a fiddle.

970
01:11:20.908 --> 01:11:22.610
What am I supposed to do. Frank?

971
01:11:23.511 --> 01:11:24.647
Why are you asking me.

972
01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.884
Because you always seem to
have the answer to things.

973
01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:31.887
Well. just
because I've been convincingly

974
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.355
portraying the
knower of all things.

975
01:11:34.389 --> 01:11:36.057
doesn't mean I
actually know things.

976
01:11:44.798 --> 01:11:46.034
I never told you this before.

977
01:11:47.668 --> 01:11:49.938
but I lost my father
when I was 13.

978
01:11:50.904 --> 01:11:54.009
It's fascinating. the
power that fathers have.

979
01:11:54.042 --> 01:11:55.778
present or absent.

980
01:11:57.378 --> 01:12:00.882
Most of my memories of the
old man are broken promises.

981
01:12:03.917 --> 01:12:05.688
but he took me
roller skating once.

982
01:12:08.856 --> 01:12:09.957
It was a really good time.

983
01:12:12.659 --> 01:12:15.863
I always just
thought you liked disco.

984
01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:17.966
I hate disco.

985
01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.941
Kid. do what you gotta do.

986
01:12:27.908 --> 01:12:30.712
If you want revenge.
I'll help you.

987
01:12:34.114 --> 01:12:36.751
If you wanna call
it off. I'm good.

988
01:12:57.137 --> 01:13:01.475
Hey. hey. I'm actually
heading downstairs

989
01:13:01.509 --> 01:13:03.444
to get some pretty
terrible coffee.

990
01:13:03.478 --> 01:13:04.645
Do you want some?

991
01:13:04.679 --> 01:13:05.480
Ah. I'm good. thank you.

992
01:13:05.512 --> 01:13:06.113
You sure?

993
01:13:06.146 --> 01:13:07.548
Yeah.

994
01:13:07.582 --> 01:13:10.685
All right. let me
get this for you.

995
01:13:10.717 --> 01:13:11.586
Hey.

996
01:13:11.618 --> 01:13:14.589
Emily. how's it going?

997
01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:17.190
Ah.

998
01:13:19.594 --> 01:13:20.594
You okay?

999
01:13:24.599 --> 01:13:25.599
No.

1000
01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:28.836
What's going on?

1001
01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:37.078
I don't even
know where to start.

1002
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:39.448
Okay. talk to me.

1003
01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:56.631
Look. I'm ah. I'm
not who you think I am.

1004
01:14:01.802 --> 01:14:04.640
Okay. what does that mean?

1005
01:14:11.712 --> 01:14:14.882
Ah. I think there's
a mix up here.

1006
01:14:14.916 --> 01:14:16.150
I don't know what's going on.

1007
01:14:16.184 --> 01:14:17.193
Ma'am. you're gonna
need to come with me.

1008
01:14:17.217 --> 01:14:18.286
Why?

1009
01:14:18.319 --> 01:14:20.522
The I.D. that she gave us
was flagged by our system.

1010
01:14:22.657 --> 01:14:23.257
What does that mean?

1011
01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:24.525
Ma'am. please.

1012
01:14:24.559 --> 01:14:25.494
No. no. no. this is a mistake.

1013
01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:26.560
She's our friend.

1014
01:14:26.594 --> 01:14:28.029
This is our friend.

1015
01:14:28.061 --> 01:14:28.829
I understand but your friend's
gonna have to come with me.

1016
01:14:28.863 --> 01:14:29.764
No. she's fine.

1017
01:14:29.796 --> 01:14:31.198
I just said she can stay.

1018
01:14:31.231 --> 01:14:32.132
Ma'am.
ma'am. please now. come with me.

1019
01:14:32.166 --> 01:14:32.934
Don't touch her.

1020
01:14:32.966 --> 01:14:33.601
Okay. come on. please.

1021
01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:34.202
Okay. okay.

1022
01:14:34.234 --> 01:14:35.569
Do not touch her!

1023
01:14:35.603 --> 01:14:36.337
She hasn't done
anything wrong. Emily.

1024
01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:37.239
Ma'am. please. this way. please.

1025
01:14:37.271 --> 01:14:38.271
I'm sorry.

1026
01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.949
Hey. I'm Detective De Ritis.

1027
01:14:47.981 --> 01:14:49.551
Hey. you guys are fast.

1028
01:14:49.583 --> 01:14:51.185
Yeah. I was in the neighborhood.

1029
01:14:51.219 --> 01:14:53.822
so when the call
went out. I came out.

1030
01:14:53.854 --> 01:14:54.856
Is this her?

1031
01:14:57.225 --> 01:14:59.027
You did a good job.

1032
01:15:11.238 --> 01:15:12.740
Thanks. man.

1033
01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:14.176
Yeah. no problem. anytime.

1034
01:15:16.877 --> 01:15:18.279
Good to see you again. Rach.

1035
01:15:20.814 --> 01:15:21.814
I had to do it.

1036
01:15:23.885 --> 01:15:25.253
You got too close to the mark.

1037
01:15:25.286 --> 01:15:27.689
They never
should've been a mark.

1038
01:15:30.358 --> 01:15:32.961
I'm sorry. I know
they were your friends.

1039
01:15:32.993 --> 01:15:34.328
How could you?

1040
01:15:34.362 --> 01:15:37.632
For the same reason I
didn't tell you about Ben.

1041
01:15:37.664 --> 01:15:39.268
You wouldn't have
gone through with it.

1042
01:15:43.203 --> 01:15:44.203
I know you hate me.

1043
01:15:47.007 --> 01:15:49.077
And I know you hate yourself.

1044
01:15:49.109 --> 01:15:50.978
but that hate is misguided.

1045
01:15:51.878 --> 01:15:54.115
Direct it to the person
that deserves it.

1046
01:15:57.217 --> 01:15:59.186
This is our chance to take back

1047
01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:00.822
everything that he took from us.

1048
01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:04.091
He owes us.

1049
01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:06.962
Plus I gotta know.

1050
01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:10.930
Know what?

1051
01:16:11.666 --> 01:16:15.869
I gotta know why.

1052
01:16:15.903 --> 01:16:17.072
Why weren't we enough?

1053
01:16:18.939 --> 01:16:21.309
Why didn't he come
back for us. huh?

1054
01:16:23.243 --> 01:16:26.347
I mean what's so wrong with us?

1055
01:16:36.923 --> 01:16:41.262
We do this tomorrow and
that's it for good. I swear.

1056
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.907
It's this or
Vaughn. your choice.

1057
01:17:08.189 --> 01:17:09.189
Are you sure?

1058
01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:19.001
If Rachel is hurt in this.
know that I will end you.

1059
01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:45.326
I didn't have any candles.

1060
01:17:45.359 --> 01:17:48.230
I don't know. potpourri.
incense. something.

1061
01:17:50.997 --> 01:17:54.769
All right. Ben. close you eyes.

1062
01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:59.440
and think of your
daughter. think of her.

1063
01:18:21.295 --> 01:18:22.698
Now say her name.

1064
01:18:28.301 --> 01:18:29.301
Katie.

1065
01:18:54.261 --> 01:18:57.898
Katie. what would you
like to say to your father?

1066
01:19:06.006 --> 01:19:07.274
Hello. Daddy.

1067
01:19:14.247 --> 01:19:15.849
What's taking so long?

1068
01:19:26.493 --> 01:19:27.862
How are you?

1069
01:19:32.966 --> 01:19:33.966
I'm ah.

1070
01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:38.840
I'm okay now.

1071
01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:43.844
Hmm.

1072
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:48.349
Where are you?

1073
01:19:58.592 --> 01:20:00.194
I'm right here.

1074
01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:18.512
Um. I just wanna say
how much I love you.

1075
01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:22.417
and how much I miss you.

1076
01:20:22.449 --> 01:20:25.519
and how sorry I am
about what happened.

1077
01:20:49.143 --> 01:20:51.246
Why did you leave me?

1078
01:20:51.279 --> 01:20:52.388
Oh. sweetheart.
I didn't leave you.

1079
01:20:52.412 --> 01:20:54.148
I didn't leave you.

1080
01:20:56.917 --> 01:20:58.353
I tried to save you.

1081
01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:01.021
I tried to save you.

1082
01:21:01.055 --> 01:21:02.222
It should've been me.

1083
01:21:02.256 --> 01:21:05.160
I should be. baby.
it should've been me.

1084
01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.297
Then why didn't you look for me?

1085
01:21:09.329 --> 01:21:10.597
I have looked for you.

1086
01:21:10.631 --> 01:21:11.911
I have looked everywhere
for you.

1087
01:21:14.034 --> 01:21:15.470
No. you didn't.

1088
01:21:21.175 --> 01:21:23.445
Why didn't you love
me like you loved her?

1089
01:21:30.016 --> 01:21:32.487
Who?

1090
01:21:33.654 --> 01:21:34.654
What's going on?

1091
01:21:38.024 --> 01:21:38.692
What is this?

1092
01:21:38.725 --> 01:21:39.725
Ben.

1093
01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.144
What're you doing?

1094
01:21:56.176 --> 01:21:57.511
We almost had it.

1095
01:21:57.545 --> 01:21:58.712
Open the safe.

1096
01:21:58.746 --> 01:22:00.480
I told you
to wait for our signal.

1097
01:22:00.514 --> 01:22:02.016
You planned this.

1098
01:22:02.048 --> 01:22:03.283
Shut up. Frank!

1099
01:22:03.317 --> 01:22:04.519
Your name is Frank?

1100
01:22:05.485 --> 01:22:06.421
Open the safe.

1101
01:22:06.453 --> 01:22:07.521
Micah.

1102
01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:10.291
Do it. please. go ahead.

1103
01:22:11.591 --> 01:22:13.627
Don't think I won't.

1104
01:22:14.595 --> 01:22:15.630
Please.

1105
01:22:18.666 --> 01:22:20.134
Rachel.

1106
01:22:22.636 --> 01:22:25.406
This wasn't a part of the plan.

1107
01:22:27.507 --> 01:22:31.578
All right. okay.
fine. excuse me.

1108
01:22:43.623 --> 01:22:46.693
Much obliged. let's go.

1109
01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:53.268
Just the cash and
coins. come on.

1110
01:23:08.548 --> 01:23:11.685
Here. don't forget this.

1111
01:23:27.801 --> 01:23:33.007
Angels. hmm. you know.
Satan was an angel.

1112
01:23:41.347 --> 01:23:42.347
Come on. Rachel.

1113
01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:56.064
Rachel. come on. Rachel.

1114
01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.128
Why are you taking that?

1115
01:24:28.162 --> 01:24:28.863
Is it worth anything?

1116
01:24:28.895 --> 01:24:29.895
Just get in the car!

1117
01:24:32.832 --> 01:24:35.302
Oh. he'll probably be all right.

1118
01:24:35.336 --> 01:24:37.704
Just wake up with a bad
headache and an empty safe.

1119
01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:39.807
Better get outta here.

1120
01:24:44.377 --> 01:24:45.846
Rachel. we should go.

1121
01:25:32.393 --> 01:25:34.261
Your brother is
quite the mastermind.

1122
01:25:35.796 --> 01:25:36.597
It's my fault.

1123
01:25:36.630 --> 01:25:37.699
I taught him too well.

1124
01:25:38.798 --> 01:25:39.600
You didn't teach him that.

1125
01:25:39.632 --> 01:25:42.436
That's just evil.

1126
01:25:46.806 --> 01:25:47.806
Whatchu gonna do now?

1127
01:25:50.711 --> 01:25:52.380
I don't know. you?

1128
01:25:55.716 --> 01:25:57.452
Darling. I'm as lost as you are.

1129
01:25:59.853 --> 01:26:00.755
You know what they say.

1130
01:26:00.787 --> 01:26:02.322
whenever God closes a door.

1131
01:26:02.355 --> 01:26:03.523
He opens a safe.

1132
01:28:36.777 --> 01:28:38.878
You know they say imitation

1133
01:28:38.912 --> 01:28:41.048
is the sincerest
form of flattery.

1134
01:28:43.917 --> 01:28:47.055
All right. I'm sorry
about all that.

1135
01:28:48.588 --> 01:28:49.588
Oh.

1136
01:28:52.024 --> 01:28:55.095
I. I think this
might belong to you.

1137
01:29:18.719 --> 01:29:19.920
Here you all go.

1138
01:29:19.953 --> 01:29:20.788
Let me know if you
need anything. okay?

1139
01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:22.555
Thank you.

1140
01:30:00.894 --> 01:30:03.097
Rachel. we need
you to clear table three.

1141
01:30:21.614 --> 01:30:24.117
Hey. forgot your wallet.

1142
01:30:24.150 --> 01:30:26.186
Oh. thank you. sweetheart.

1143
01:30:27.186 --> 01:30:28.221
God bless you.

1144
01:30:28.255 --> 01:30:31.525
Thanks.

1145
01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:43.171
That seems like something
an angel would do.

1146
01:30:47.807 --> 01:30:49.644
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1147
01:30:55.148 --> 01:30:56.484
I'm ah. sorry.

1148
01:31:04.157 --> 01:31:05.157
So am I.

1149
01:31:09.162 --> 01:31:10.231
Can we talk?

1150
01:31:15.068 --> 01:31:16.270
I'm in the middle of a shift.

1151
01:31:16.302 --> 01:31:18.538
I don't get off for
a couple of hours.

1152
01:31:18.572 --> 01:31:21.576
I'll wait if that's okay.

1153
01:31:27.881 --> 01:31:28.881
Yeah.
