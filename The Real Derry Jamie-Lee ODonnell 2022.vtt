00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.960
Cheers.
My name is Jamie-Lee O'Donnell.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.600
# Do-da-da-do...
And you might know me from
the comedy series Derry Girls.

7
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.160
Motherfuckers!

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.360
Motherfucker. It's my new thing.

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.800
In the show. my character Michelle
Mallon is a foul-mouthed schoolgirl

10
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.840
determined to live her best life.
despite growing up in a war zone.

11
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.760
Michelle. he's a soldier.
Ach. some of them are rides.

12
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.520
You're a fucking embarrassment!

13
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.840
LOUD BLAST

14
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.720
In real life. I'm nothing
like Michelle. of course.

15
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.480
Listen!
I'm going up the fucking hill.

16
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.040
I'm gonna ask him
a couple of questions.
SHE LAUGHS

17
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.960
I'm an Irish woman.
an Irish working-class woman.
and I'm very proud of that.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.360
I'm a Derry girl born and bred.
and no matter where I am.
Derry is home.

19
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.960
I've always wanted to show people
how amazing it is. Just like
a wee love letter to Derry.

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.800
But nearly 25 years
after the Good Friday Agreement

21
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.160
marked the start of a new. more
peaceful era for Northern Ireland.

22
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.760
I wanna know if Derry
is a better place to grow up in now
than back then.

23
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.000
Nothing's really gonna change
if everybody's still segregated.

24
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.160
There's still a massive division
within Derry.
within the two communities.

25
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.240
I'll be finding out new things
about my own city.

26
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.640
Mad about it.
And visiting parts of it
that I've never set foot in before.

27
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.480
I saw the Union Jack
and couldn't think.

28
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.120
As well as coming to terms
with some of my own demons.

29
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
Oh. my God! Oh. my God!
Shite-ing myself to be honest.

30
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.600
Most of all. I'll be trying to
understand what it's like to be
a young person in Derry today.

31
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.840
No! We have our problems.
but I wanna solve our problems.

32
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.520
Let's get absolutely snattered.
SHE LAUGHS

33
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.760
Saoirse's one of my best friends.
She's just brilliant to work with.

34
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.880
I love all the tipples.

35
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.960
We're like the wee terrible twins.
"Do you want another one?" The other
person's not gonna say no.

36
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.240
Thank you. Cheers.
Thank you. Cheers.

37
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.120
So. I think Derry is a class
night out. as we all know.

38
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.240
What is it? What do you miss really
about Derry when you're away?

39
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.000
I miss. cos Derry's so small.
it's walking distance to get a pint.

40
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.800
It is. and a night out here
feels like a bigger event.

41
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.160
Do you know. like a night out
is out out.

42
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.800
Even when people
aren't talking about it.
we throw in the facts about Derry.

43
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.000
where's the best place to go.
when we signpost it.

44
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.760
And people say.
"Do you work for the council?"

45
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.160
We we're like.
"Should we work for the council?"

46
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.000
Should we? I think we'd do
a really good job.

47
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.000
We are also full of random facts
about the town.

48
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.400
We know so many random facts
about Derry.

49
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.280
Here's some information I know
you didn't want. but here it is.

50
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.840
Facts on Derry by Jamie-Lee
and Saoirse.Facts on Derry.
SHE LAUGHS

51
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.040
I think it's the people of Derry
that make it special for me.

52
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.600
And it comes with
all their sensibilities
and their weird and wonderful ways.

53
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.280
Like. everything's so intense.
I don't know if that's
from coming with the Troubles.

54
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.560
or the working-class background.
maybe a combination of everything.

55
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.920
But brilliant craic.
Brilliant craic. Brilliant craic.

56
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.440
It's like no matter what this town
has ever went through.

57
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.920
I think it's bred
this real lust for joy.

58
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.080
Like. there's no stopping us. Yeah.

59
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.360
There's no stopping us.
There's no stopping us. Aye.

60
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.080
While you can probably hear just
how much Saoirse and I love Derry.

61
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.120
we're not blind to its problems.

62
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.640
And obviously we're both very proud
of where we're from.

63
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.200
and I think that we're
so proud of the show. as well.

64
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.480
and I'm really proud of you
doing this documentary.

65
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.440
I don't think that there really is
a better person that could be
leading this than you.

66
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.000
I've always just really been
passionate about it growing up.

67
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.080
and some of the injustices
that happened here.
like a lot of other places.

68
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.600
and I just think it was time
to highlight stuff. just from
my perspective. if I can.

69
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.920
My beautiful hometown is in
the north-west of Northern Ireland.

70
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.600
close to the Irish border.

71
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.520
KNOCKS ON GLASS

72
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.320
Licence.

73
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.120
Where have you come from today?
Derry. Londonderry.

74
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.000
Derry. Londonderry.

75
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.840
Calm the fuck down. James!
Are you English? Yeah.

76
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.400
He's fine. We didn't bring him
up here to kill him or anything.

77
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.880
Yes. this city is so good.
they named it twice. Well. kind of.

78
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.520
Catholics call it Derry
and Protestants call it Londonderry.

79
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.640
Behind me here
is the west side of the city.
also known as the city side.

80
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.320
Back in the day.
that was mostly Catholic.

81
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.480
And then on the east here
in front of me is the water side

82
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.800
and that was mostly Protestant.

83
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.320
But even today. not much has changed

84
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.480
and the two communities
are still largely divided.

85
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.040
This is the Peace Bridge in Derry.
one of three bridges.
cos we apparently love a bridge.

86
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.560
It was built in 2011
to literally bridge the gap

87
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.240
between the Catholic community
and the Protestant community.

88
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.280
Because for a wee while.
I don't know if you've heard. we
weren't really getting on the best.

89
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.720
Have I ever dated a Protestant?
Probably. Without realising.

90
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.200
I definitely got a wee kiss
in a nightclub off a Protestant.
for defs.

91
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.320
SHE LAUGHS

92
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.760
The way the bridge curves
is meant to symbolise

93
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.240
that the path to peace
is never straight.

94
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.640
Turns out. they were right.

95
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.920
SIREN WAILS

96
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.720
In 1998. after 30 years of violence

97
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.040
and more than 3.500 deaths.

98
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.120
the Good Friday Agreement
was signed.

99
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.000
Protestants and Catholics would now
share power in Northern Ireland

100
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.320
to make things fairer for all.

101
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.760
Nearly 25 years later. I want to see

102
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.000
what life is like for young girls
growing up in Derry today.

103
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.520
So I've come back to my old school.
St Cecilia's College.

104
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.840
Although the building has had
a bit of an upgrade since my day.

105
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.240
it brings back lots of memories.

106
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.160
A French fella. that's what
I wanna do. Nation of rides.

107
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.920
My fanny's going funny just thinking
about it! Could you not use
that word. Michelle?

108
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.520
What. fanny? Why do you always
have to be so coarse?

109
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.840
What's the big deal? We all have
one. I don't. You are one.

110
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.600
Nice to meet yous all. anyway.
Nice to meet you. Aren't you
supposed to be in class? Yeah.

111
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.400
THEY LAUGH

112
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.800
I can't wait to get back to one of
my favourite classes and teachers.

113
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.800
Miss McTague and drama. So good to
see you. Thanks for having me back.

114
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.080
Thanks for having me in your class.
everybody.

115
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.040
It's been a while since you were
here.It's been a tiny while. aye.
THEY LAUGH

116
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.120
Do you wanna pick yourself out.
cos I thought this was hilarious.

117
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
cos you're hiding behind
a dog poo bin. Of course.

118
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.640
And it's dog shit.OK. good.
SHE LAUGHS

119
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.200
We'll say dog poo.
and the cot. and the real cot.

120
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.040
It's Channel 4. We can say...
THEY LAUGH

121
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.480
You're in your teacher's classroom
now. I know.
You'll mind your manners.

122
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.760
Oh. I might just swear.

123
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.840
As punishment for my bad language...

124
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.000
Oh. that's not too bad.

125
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.640
..I have to help tidy up
the props cupboard.

126
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.880
Look at this.
I remember all this stuff.

127
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.840
But it gives me a chance
to grill the girls.

128
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.200
Hi. I'm just gonna give you
bunches of stuff and then we can
have a wee sort through.

129
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.200
# Do-do-do-do

130
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.920
Anyway. so what year are yous all?
Upper sixth. Upper sixth.

131
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.400
And are yous all from Derry?

132
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.520
Yes.
This is still all girls Catholic
school. is that right? Yeah.

133
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.720
Yous don't have a wee random
Protestant fella running about.
a wee English fella? No.

134
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.000
That would be a good craic.

135
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.360
It's hard to believe
that more than 90 percent
of children in Northern Ireland

136
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.960
are still educated
in non-integrated schools.

137
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.600
That's schools that are effectively
either Catholic or Protestant.

138
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.640
Do yous mix with Protestants
outside. people of different
nationalities. anything like that?

139
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.800
Or do you stick to your own?
Everybody's different.

140
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.680
It's not voluntary.

141
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.720
We just. like... Aye.
We just so happen to be surrounded
by our own people. I think.

142
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.320
Seeking out Protestants.
If you're a Protestant.
do you wanna be my friend?

143
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.760
SHE LAUGHS
Do you wanna play netball?

144
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.960
From hearing what your parents went
through or older siblings in terms
of living in Derry and segregation.

145
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.400
do you think that's still as
prominent now. or are you finding
that it's not that big a deal?

146
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.280
I don't think it has really
anything to do with religion at all.

147
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.640
It's more political views. Like.
who cares if you're a Protestant?

148
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.920
Nobody cares
about your actual religion.

149
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.920
Do you think it's more like
cultural identity? Aye.

150
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.360
So you think there's space
to have a healthy debate
with people of your generation

151
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.240
about the cultural differences
in Derry?

152
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.920
I wouldn't say healthy.
Not healthy. No.

153
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.520
Everyone is so opinionated on it
that you almost just don't wanna
get into it.

154
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.360
if you're. like. friends with them
or... I would disagree.

155
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.840
Say I'm speaking to someone
from Belfast and I find out
they're a Protestant.

156
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.600
we could speak very openly and
honestly. as long as you're both
willing to listen.

157
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.680
But I think in Derry.
we kind of politicise it more.
kind of like standoffish.

158
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:33.160
It's just nerves.
Everybody's nervous. If you ignore
it. hope it won't be brung up. Aye.

159
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.280
It seems it can still be hard
to talk about these issues

160
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.120
and I wonder if it's because
what happened in the past

161
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.680
is still such a big part
of people's lives in Derry today.

162
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.120
Because obviously none of yous
were around during the Troubles.

163
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.160
do you think it's. even with your
generation. it still feels
a wee bit personal?

164
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.120
Northern Ireland as a whole.
Catholics and Protestants.

165
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.240
have. like. a really high
mental health rate.

166
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.600
and we were saying
that we think a lot of that
does come from the Troubles.

167
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.200
So it's been. like. passed down
through. like. trauma.

168
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.280
So is it safe to say.
in your generation.
you still feel impacted by it

169
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.040
even though yous weren't there in
person? Oh. definitely. Yeah. Aye.

170
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.000
God. that's really scary. isn't it?
It's like our mummies and daddies.

171
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.280
Of course.
It's not that far back in history.

172
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.760
For yous to feel it's impacted
your lives now is insane.

173
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.320
There's a whole new generation of
people still trying to figure it out
and still discussing it.

174
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.640
Like. it's a massive issue.

175
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.200
I don't think I was surprised
that they didn't have
much cross-community

176
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.880
or much integration
with the Protestant community.

177
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.960
You just kind of wish that it wasn't
happening still. You'd think
we'd have moved on a wee bit.

178
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.720
But it's made me think
about the fact that I also lived
a fairly segregated life

179
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.920
within my own Catholic community.

180
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.520
Maybe it's time I experienced
parts of this city

181
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.800
I've spent my entire life
scared to visit.

182
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.360
When I set out to discover
what it's like

183
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.400
to be a young person in Derry today.

184
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.000
I didn't expect to be talking
about the Troubles quite so soon.

185
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.880
But I've realised
that to understand Derry.

186
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.680
you have to go back
to the 30th of January 1972.

187
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.200
Hello. Ciara.
Hello. Jamie-Lee. how are you?

188
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.240
Great. Thanks for having me.
Not at all. Thank you for coming.

189
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.080
Ciara O'Connor Pozo is showing me
around the Museum Of Free Derry.

190
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.520
where the main exhibition
remembers a day the people of Derry
will never forget.

191
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.880
This is the Derry
Civil Rights Association banner.

192
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.840
And it was actually carried
on Bloody Sunday.

193
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.480
You might see that
it's kind of a bit stained.

194
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.880
and that's actually because it was
lain over the body of Hugh Gilmour.

195
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.200
who was shot
just outside the Rossville flats.

196
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.120
17-year-old Hugh Gilmour
was shot dead on Bloody Sunday.

197
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:09.320
He was one of 13 people killed by
British Army paratroopers that day.

198
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.400
A 14th man died from his injuries
five months later.

199
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.120
It's quite a sad exhibition.
as well. It's quite powerful.

200
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.000
It is. It's really overwhelming.
isn't it... Mm-hm. ..to see it?

201
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.960
The Troubles in Northern Ireland
started in the late 1960s.

202
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.200
fuelled by historical events
and social injustices.

203
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.680
After more than 700 years
of British rule.

204
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.480
Ireland had been partitioned
in 1921.

205
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.600
Six of the island's 32 counties
became Northern Ireland

206
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.800
and remained under British rule.

207
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:53.920
After partition.
many Catholics in Northern Ireland
faced discrimination.

208
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:59.480
particularly in housing. jobs.
voting and political representation.

209
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.840
By the 1960s.
people here were taking to the
streets in civil rights protests.

210
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.880
It was against this backdrop
that one of Northern Ireland's
darkest days unfolded

211
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.120
right here in Derry.

212
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.480
GUNFIRE

213
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.560
I would describe Bloody Sunday as...

214
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.040
a day in Derry history.
Irish history.

215
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.200
that changed the course of history.

216
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.920
EXPLOSION
Three hours
after the procession began.

217
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.480
this has ended up.
as dusk comes onto the Bogside.

218
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.480
as the worst ever confrontation
between the Army

219
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.040
and the Catholic people
of the Creggan and Bogside.

220
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.000
It was a civil rights march.

221
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.920
The Derry people were marching
for the rights that they deserved.

222
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.120
EXPLOSION

223
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.560
And the British paratroopers
opened fire

224
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.800
and murdered 13 people on the day.
14 total.

225
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.040
Innocent. defenceless people.

226
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.840
There are three in that Saracen
car. There are two men laying
at the end of this block of flats.

227
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.880
There's another man at least
very close to being dead.
There are two others up there.

228
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.920
SIREN WAILS

229
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.920
This exhibit actually contains
personal effects that would have
belonged to the victims.

230
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.400
One of the ones that I think is
really powerful is this baby grow.

231
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.640
that was used to stem the blood
of Michael Kelly.

232
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.960
And he was brought in injured
to a house and this woman
obviously just found a baby grow

233
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.520
and used it to stop the blood.
But he unfortunately died.

234
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.440
There was quite a few 17-year-olds
that died on the day.
and he was one of them.

235
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.800
How prominent do you think
those stories are?

236
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.200
Do you think they would resonate
with 17-year-olds now?

237
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.080
There's young people here in Derry
that would go on climate marches
and... Yeah.

238
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.560
..we kind of take that. that right
to go out and make our views heard.

239
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.920
we kind of take that
nearly for granted.

240
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.240
And this was just 50 years ago.

241
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.280
The Bloody Sunday families
spent decades fighting to clear
the names of their loved ones.

242
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.320
An initial inquiry had endorsed
claims that the soldiers opened fire

243
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.000
only after they came under attack
from the crowd.

244
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.040
In 2010.
the Saville Inquiry made it clear

245
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.360
that soldiers had lied
in these claims

246
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.880
and concluded that the killings
were unjustifiable.

247
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.600
Now. Saville uses the term
"unjustifiable."

248
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.880
But to me. and most people I know.

249
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.880
an unjustifiable killing
is the same as murder.

250
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.880
It took 38 years for the British
government to apologise.

251
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.240
What happened on Bloody Sunday

252
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.960
was both unjustified
and unjustifiable.

253
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

254
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.920
The trauma of the violence
doesn't just affect
those who lived through it.

255
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.920
The stories of the Troubles
and the soldiers and all that.
we all know that.

256
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.120
It's not that far back in the past.
My parents had lessons in school

257
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.920
how to listen out for gunfire
and what material to hide behind.

258
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.160
Was it under a car or behind a wall?

259
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.160
To understand about bombs
and things like that.

260
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.960
GUNSHOT

261
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
But growing up in Derry.
it was just...
you just always had to be aware.

262
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.320
and I didn't really fully know why
because I didn't grow up
through the 70s.

263
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.760
But there was just this sort of
panicked energy around the adults
of just fear.

264
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.880
It's been 50 years
since Bloody Sunday.

265
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.120
and I've been asked to do a reading
at a special commemoration event.

266
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.360
Thanks for inviting me.
It's an honour.

267
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:02.200
But I always get really nervous
with stuff like this. cos it's such
a huge responsibility. isn't it?

268
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.800
We wanted to put together
a massive public event
that everyone could attend.

269
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.880
It's kind of about looking forward
with hope. but still remembering
what happened.

270
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:16.040
It's shaped our culture
in many ways. It has.
I'm even more nervous now.

271
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.160
Being in the museum and speaking to
Ciara. I think it's really brought
home the responsibility

272
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.560
that I have in that little section
of the performance

273
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.240
at making sure I do it justice
and do Derry people proud and
the people who've gone through it.

274
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.040
So it's nerve-racking.
but I'm really honoured to be asked.

275
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.760
Growing up in Derry.
I spent most of my time with people
brought up Catholic like me.

276
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.240
But around a quarter of
the population here is Protestant.

277
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.520
And while I've had
a few Protestant friends.

278
00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:56.240
I don't know much about
their culture or traditions.
Except for one.

279
00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.360
To think. I could be
staring at him right now.

280
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.640
You can't marry an Orange man.
Michelle. It's a pity.

281
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.400
Because I think there's something
really sexy about the fact
that they hate us so much.

282
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.360
No. Have I ever been
to a 12th of July March? No. It's
just funny that you would ask that.

283
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.520
BRASS BAND PLAYS
Everyone in Northern Ireland
knows about the 12th of July.

284
00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.160
or the 12th as it's better known.

285
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.280
It's the anniversary
of the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.

286
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.280
when a Protestant king
defeated a Catholic king.

287
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.760
Protestant marches and parades
take place on this
and other big anniversaries

288
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.800
throughout the year
in Northern Ireland.

289
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.080
One of the organisations
that celebrates Protestant culture

290
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.200
is based in this building
right in the centre of Derry.

291
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.920
And needless to say. I've never
set foot in this place before.

292
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.400
Something I never thought
in a million years I would do.

293
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.200
cos I thought I'd just walk in
and catch flames or something.
I don't know.

294
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.520
Plot twist. I'm a Protestant.

295
00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.400
I'm here to meet one of the oldest
foot bands in the country.

296
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.360
who take part in lots
of different events and parades.
including the 12th.

297
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.960
BAND PLAYS
It's my favourite.

298
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.480
As I walk in. their weekly
practice is well underway.

299
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.400
Even hearing this music
makes me feel a bit weird.

300
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.400
Something you need to know about me
is that when I'm nervous.
I talk... a lot.

301
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:37.560
Hello.How are you?Do you know any
Wolfe Tones? No. I'm only joking.
THEY LAUGH

302
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.240
Thank yous for having me.
And I just wanted to sort of
get a wee chat to yous

303
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.520
and just ask yous
what is all this about?

304
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.560
What's the craic?What's the craic?
THEY LAUGH

305
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.800
It's a big surprise.
I don't know anybody
who plays in a marching band.

306
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.560
And is it predominantly Protestant
people that play in the bands?

307
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.000
It is. yes.
It's predominant Protestant.
Is there any bands that you know of

308
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.880
that has a mix
of different religions?

309
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.320
Obviously. on parade.
if it's an Orange parade. it usually
technically would always be...

310
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.080
Just for safety reasons.
it has to be all Protestants.

311
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:11.400
But. I mean. we do cross-border
things with Catholics bands.
if you want to call them that.

312
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.640
You're brought up with it
and you do join from an early age.

313
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.920
Younger people. again. a lot
of them come from family members.

314
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.120
And it can transpire into academia.
as well. So a lot of the parents
are very happy for them

315
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.480
to come and learn their instruments
and become part of the band.

316
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.560
It's all going so well
until I mention Bloody Sunday.

317
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.840
I also wanted to ask yous.
the 50th anniversary
of Bloody Sunday is coming up.

318
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.440
and I just wanted to ask. again.
you don't have to answer.

319
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.560
what's your perception of that?

320
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.840
Would yous. I don't know. would yous
be interesting in that at all?
Or does it...

321
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:51.360
Is it anything to do with yous.
or how would yous feel about it?
If anything. It might be nothing.

322
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.880
OK. Great.

323
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.160
There was just a radio silence.
And I'll be honest.

324
00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.520
I was really. really shocked.
because I didn't anticipate...

325
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.040
a reaction about it
different to mine.

326
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.320
And I know that's a wee bit
ignorant to me. I suppose.

327
00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.960
But I really didn't expect
that level of silence at all.

328
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.800
I think I made people really
uncomfortable. And I didn't mean to.

329
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.480
So we just moved on
with the conversation. I think
I made a couple of awkward jokes

330
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.800
cos I just do that whenever
it's awkward. You just sort of
have a couple of jokes.

331
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.320
Well. we'll just put that aside.
We'll put that aside.

332
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.560
Do yous know any Irish jigs? I don't
think I even know any Irish jigs.

333
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.440
There's Irish jigs in the folder.
Irish jigs. aye.

334
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.120
Guys. it's not in the folder.
What's this wee guy called?

335
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.960
It looks like a wee hotdog.
It's a baton. Baton!

336
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.440
Hold the big end. There we go.
THEY LAUGH
I thought it was the wee hotdog end.

337
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.760
THEY LAUGH

338
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.680
One. two.
THEY PLAY

339
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.240
This feels slightly surreal.

340
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.760
Here I am conducting
a Protestant flute band.

341
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.480
surrounded by flags
I'd usually run a mile from.

342
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.440
Unlike me.
many in the Protestant community

343
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.880
see themselves as British
and are loyal to the Crown.

344
00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.560
But even though we come
from very different worlds.

345
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.960
everyone in the flute band
has been really welcoming to me.

346
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.640
That was really good.
Yous are really. really good.
That's brilliant.

347
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:27.840
I want to find out more about
what it's like to be a young person
in the Protestant community here.

348
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:33.440
Hi. Julie. how are you? How are you?
I'm good. So I'm meeting Julie
from the band for a drink.

349
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.800
Was there any feedback
after I left? Were they thinking.
"She's a head case"?

350
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.720
We want you as our new conductor
now.
That was really good. wasn't it?

351
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.080
Yous are good banter. as well.
It was a good craic.

352
00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.240
I just sort of wanted to ask.
do you think there's certain things

353
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.800
that are really affecting the
Protestant community in Derry at the
moment? Any sort of social issues?

354
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.320
A lot of working-class
Protestant areas.
there's problems with education.

355
00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:01.840
under-achievement within education.
particularly within working-class
Protestant boys.

356
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.280
There's been an increase
in the use of food banks.

357
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.720
So there is a lot of social issues
going on.

358
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.720
particularly within the Protestant
community at the minute. as well.

359
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.760
When you look across the spectrum of
the city. you see that everybody's
facing the same thing.

360
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.000
We're feeling people who are
struggling with mental health issues
across Northern Ireland.

361
00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.120
And so something really needs
to be done about it.

362
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.120
I don't know what it's like to grow
up in the Protestant community

363
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:30.760
or to be British
over in this part of the world.
I can't imagine the goal... was...

364
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.280
for the Protestant community to come
down and face the problems we have.

365
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.800
It just feels like
everybody's fucked now.

366
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.920
While the British government
has said

367
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.200
its commitment to Northern Ireland
and the union is unshakeable.

368
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.760
many people feel the problems here
are being made worse by Brexit.

369
00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.720
And there's increased discussions
about the possibility
of a border pool

370
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.320
and a united Ireland.

371
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.440
How do you think that would make
you feel. or your community feel?

372
00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:03.160
There is a wee bit of hurt in the
community that sometimes we're just
sort of still just seen as.

373
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.240
"Oh. they're Irish over there."
Whereas we see ourselves
as British Northern Irish.

374
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.440
We would want to remain
part of the UK.

375
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:15.360
So any issues that stem
from our community.

376
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:20.120
regardless. come from the fact
that sometimes you can feel
identity slipping away.

377
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.120
And identity is a very important
thing to Protestant people

378
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.520
because it's part of who we are.

379
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:30.160
And what would you say
in the next ten years
would you like to see. if anything?

380
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.160
I would just like to see
the city thriving. Peaceful freedom.

381
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.480
peaceful celebration of culture
for everybody.

382
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.200
Thank you so much. Julie.
I really appreciate it.
And cheers to the wee drink.

383
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.800
Thanks for coming.
Let's get absolutely snattered.
THEY LAUGH

384
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.640
I'm so pleased Derry is now a place

385
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.640
where I can go for a drink
with someone like Julie.

386
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:55.200
But this is a city still held
hostage by its complicated history.

387
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.040
And I've realised that to move on.
we need to tackle the trauma
head-on.

388
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.080
Even if that means confronting
my own demons.

389
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.200
..that will live long
in the memory of the people.

390
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.880
What was supposed to be
a simple civil rights march

391
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.000
turned into a day
of bloodshed and horror.

392
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:29.040
I'm rehearsing my lines
for the Bloody Sunday
50th anniversary event.

393
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.080
British men thumbing through history
pages looking for solutions...

394
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.880
It's a huge part of Derry history.

395
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.120
Obviously it was a negative part
for such a long time.

396
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.920
and I think this commemoration
service that's happening

397
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.440
is maybe a way to look at how far
we've come in this city. hopefully.

398
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.320
and that in itself
is such a big responsibility.

399
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.160
What was supposed to be
a simple civil rights march

400
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.840
turned into a day of bloodshed
and horror

401
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.760
that will live long
in the memory of the people.

402
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.600
Having to think about what happened
is proving difficult for me

403
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.280
and is bringing a lot of my own
childhood trauma to the surface.

404
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.240
If you grew up in a certain place
where you're afraid of the police.

405
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.800
it definitely does something
to your decisions

406
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.800
and how you feel about yourself
and how you value yourself.

407
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.920
If the people who are supposed
to protect you. look after you.
you're brought up afraid of them.

408
00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.480
and are distrusting of them...
it leaves you a bit lost.

409
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:31.240
It's just fucking overwhelming. And
I just think it's unfair for people.

410
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.440
especially my parents' generation.

411
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.080
Looking back as an adult.
it's really hard not to get
really heartbroken by it.

412
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.960
and you feel. like. devastated
for your family.

413
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.920
Maybe it's no wonder
many people think there's
a mental health crisis in Derry.

414
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.840
something experts recognise as
linked to Troubles-related trauma.

415
00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:56.280
These people still struggle
with the devastation of it.
We're still segregated.

416
00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.400
And that's just not fixed
within a generation.

417
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.600
Despite everything
this place has been through.

418
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.280
there's a resilience in Derry people
that I think is nothing short
of incredible.

419
00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.120
Hi. Serena. Oh. hey! How are you?

420
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:28.080
Serena Terry
is an amazingly-talented Derry woman
turned online sensation.

421
00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.000
Her character. Mammy Banter.
has over 20 million likes on TikTok.

422
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.640
Don't judge me. right? Right.

423
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.400
I can do it. Jesus shit!

424
00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:45.600
I don't know where he's heard that.
That's class!
SHE LAUGHS

425
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.880
Serena has used
this huge online platform

426
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.720
to get people talking
about mental health in Derry.

427
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.640
And she's brutally honest
about her own experience.

428
00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.680
My name's Serena. I'm a mum of two.
35-year-old. and I am on medication
for anxiety and depression

429
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.760
and have been for six years.
But that was enough then

430
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.560
to start the conversation and the
narrative around mental health.
and the feedback I got

431
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.920
from thousands and thousands
of people

432
00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.800
to say that they. too. were either
on medication for anxiety.

433
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.800
or were suffering. feeling that
they couldn't ask for help.

434
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.120
that this is just
part and parcel of life.

435
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:27.240
Serena's struggle with anxiety
is something many people.
including me. could relate to.

436
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.320
When I got to the stage
of asking for help.
it took me about two years.

437
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.360
I was in complete denial.
And I just broke down

438
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.920
in front of the doctors and that
was enough for them to see...

439
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.240
Aye. it's a scary thing.
That happened to myself. too.

440
00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.520
and I was worried about my anxiety.
even after Derry Girls took off.

441
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.640
And you think
all your Christmases came at once
so you should be dead happy

442
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.680
and everything's supposed
to be fine. Perfect.

443
00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.200
And then it's like. "Well.
what have you got to be sad about?"

444
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.560
And you start to think about it.
you're like "Fuck everything!"
I wrote my will. Jesus!

445
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.800
I wrote my will. I was going to bed
every night thinking I'm not gonna
wake up in the morning.

446
00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:03.240
And it spiralled into anxiety
and panic attacks and depression.

447
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.880
Serena's openness is helping me
confront my own feelings.

448
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.600
Do you know what? Even doing this
documentary. I'm struggling.

449
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.080
cos I get so much anxiety
when I'm going to film.

450
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.680
in my stomach. and I feel like
I physically want to run away.

451
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.760
but I have to just get over it.
and I've been doing that.
and I'm glad I am.

452
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:23.160
but even now. pulling apart all this
stuff and having to think about
my life... Your personal stuff.

453
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.960
..it's freaking me out. Is it?
But I'm glad I'm doing it.
Have you ever been so open? No.

454
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
This whole process has been dead
nerve-racking and really
uncomfortable. if I'm being honest.

455
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.840
I know it's something I want to do.
I knew it would be uncomfortable

456
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.720
because it's close to home
and I don't like crying.
I still have that sort of...

457
00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.400
that sort of closed-off-ness
that you sort of get
coming from here sometimes.

458
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.560
How would you view the mental health
crisis within Derry?

459
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.560
I have seen first-hand. erm...

460
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.360
the legacy of the conflict
and the Troubles.

461
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.680
from my daddy and him
having paranoid schizophrenia.

462
00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.080
The legacy of deprivation.
poverty and...

463
00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:07.000
most recently. I've seen
the legacy of lack of funding.

464
00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:12.880
We've less funding for mental health
services than anywhere in the UK.

465
00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.600
And it just frustrates me.
It just doesn't make any sense.

466
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.120
So we walk further down the beach
and we do a wee warm up.

467
00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.320
just to get the blood going
and heat up the body.

468
00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:29.040
Serena decided to try and improve
her own mental health
with some cold-water swimming.

469
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.160
Now hundreds of others in Derry
are joining her.

470
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.720
The cold-water dipping. Yes.
I think it sounds terrifying.

471
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.920
You look really nervous every time
you say that. Because it's mental.

472
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.840
It doesn't make any sense. It's
Ireland. What are you talking about?

473
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.600
So I went and I tried it and...

474
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.080
within a couple of days.
my whole mood changed. I felt
as if I could take on the world.

475
00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.480
And I started documenting it
on Instagram.

476
00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.920
So many people were like. "Tell me
more about this cold-water dipping."

477
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:58.360
So I put an open invite. I set up a
page on Instagram and I said. "Come
along. I'll teach yous how to do it.

478
00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:03.240
"We'll go down every week."
And here we are.
We've over 200 people in the group.

479
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:11.960
It's ranging from 17. 18-year-old
girls who are suffering with anxiety
and are using it as treatment.

480
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.480
and then we've got
that older demographic.

481
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.800
who are grieving from suicide.

482
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:24.520
The way I see it.
if ten people are benefiting
more now with their mental health

483
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.000
than they were before Christmas.

484
00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.240
it's the proudest thing
I've ever done in my life.

485
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.360
I wanna help you. OK. Cos you've
been feeling a wee bit anxious.

486
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.560
Yes. very much so. Are you gonna
come down into the cold water?

487
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.840
Erm... You'll love it. I swear.

488
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.320
You'll hit me. You'll probably punch
me in the first 20 seconds.
but you'll love it.

489
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.360
Can I have a wee think and see
the craic? Cos it is winter.
Have a wee think.

490
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.760
I would really. really love you
to come down. though. OK.

491
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.960
And I think it'll just calm you.

492
00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.360
CLOCK CHIMES

493
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.680
CLOCK CHIMES

494
00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.000
I don't remember ever finding out
about Bloody Sunday.

495
00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.680
I think it was just always something
that everybody knew about.

496
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.960
My grandpa marched in Bloody Sunday.
like a lot of people's families did.

497
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.920
My family knew some of the people
who were murdered.

498
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.280
It's sewn into who we are as people.

499
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.560
It's 50 years today
since Bloody Sunday

500
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.400
and preparations are underway
for the commemoration event.

501
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.560
I'm really. really nervous.
if I'm honest.

502
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.640
It's a huge thing. it's a huge deal
to be here and to be part of it.

503
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.560
and I'm just massively appreciative.
and just hope I do it justice
and do it well.

504
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.920
I'm also nervous that I'm sharing
the stage with Derry actress and
Hollywood star Bronagh Gallagher.

505
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.920
We have to remember
the line we come in.

506
00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.560
I think it goes name. then lights.
they were saying last night.

507
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.200
so I'll say the name.
cues the light. Is that right?

508
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.520
Our role is to read out the names
of the people who died that day.

509
00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:08.320
So it's like a wee five seconds
in between. Yeah. Yeah.
We can try it now.

510
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.320
As the audience take their seats.
I'm trying to focus
on what I have to do.

511
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.120
This is one of the most important
performances of my life.

512
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.680
Right.

513
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.680
Oh. my God! I'm shite-ing myself. I
just realised I have to go on stage.
I always do this.

514
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.880
like. walking out.

515
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.440
Until I have a drink of water.
and then just sort of panic. And be
like. "Oh! I have to go on stage!"

516
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.760
It's a technique. I suppose.

517
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:45.640
ALL: # Oh. Danny boy

518
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:51.360
# The pipes. the pipes are calling

519
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.520
# From glen to glen

520
00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:00.760
# And down the mountain side

521
00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.640
# The summer's gone

522
00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:11.880
# And all the flowers are dying

523
00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.240
# 'Tis you. 'tis you...

524
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.400
As Bronagh. Adrian Dunbar and I
wait in the wings.

525
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.120
the emotion of the singing
and the sombre atmosphere hits me.

526
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.680
APPLAUSE

527
00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.960
I'm trying not to cry.
Just until I get through my bit.

528
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
because you don't want. like...

529
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.520
It was so hard to not let
your emotions run away with you
before I went on stage.

530
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.680
APPLAUSE

531
00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:02.520
On that fateful day in 1972.

532
00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.080
the world saw what happened.

533
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.880
The whole world knew
of the 14 innocents stolen away.

534
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.240
The absence of justice

535
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.400
and the depth of grief

536
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.240
are scarred
on the souls of the bereaved.

537
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.880
I think every family in Derry
has experienced trauma.

538
00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.560
Everybody in the north has.
How could you not?

539
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.120
You talk about people who had lost
their lives. who were murdered.

540
00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.160
and who died in such an awful way.

541
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.160
And to be able to remember that
and note it 50 years later.

542
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:43.320
I mean. it felt like you could've
heard a pin drop when we were
talking. which was amazing.

543
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.600
Kevin McElhinney.

544
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.800
Bernard McGuigan.

545
00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.720
For all the victims of the conflict.

546
00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.880
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

547
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.400
I was actually squeezing my hand
so I wouldn't cry. especially
when the music kicked in.

548
00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.080
I feel like I've been
holding this in for ages.

549
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.040
It sort of just brings it all home.
doesn't it?

550
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.840
About what everybody in Derry
went through.

551
00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.800
And there's a lot of good. as well.
obviously. to come from this. but...

552
00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.920
aye. it's a lot. I knew this was
gonna happen at some point.

553
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.880
I'm so glad we did it. So am I.
And we didn't break down.

554
00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.800
So hopefully I done everybody proud.
Hopefully.

555
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.760
Remembering the horror
of Bloody Sunday reminds me how
important it is to try and secure

556
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.440
a fair and peaceful future
for everyone in Derry.

557
00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.600
But we're not quite there yet.
and I do sometimes wonder

558
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.240
has the violence
really gone away for good?

559
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.960
I've been discovering
just how much Derry's past

560
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.320
has influenced its people today.
myself included.

561
00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:24.440
And I've learned there's no single
solution to the challenges we face.

562
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.240
but that it's good to be open
to new experiences.

563
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.320
This is gonna be a nightmare.
Or brilliant. one of the two.

564
00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.080
So. it's January

565
00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.240
and it's Ireland

566
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.520
and I'm not quite sure
how it's come about.

567
00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.680
but I'm going for a swim.

568
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.440
I can't believe
I'm gonna go do this.

569
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.480
Oh. it's freezing.

570
00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:52.800
I'm joining Serena and dozens of
locals for some cold-water swimming

571
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.920
to try and help my anxiety.

572
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.000
Everybody. are you ready
to get into the water?

573
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.360
Oh. my God! Oh. my God!

574
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.560
Jamie-Lee. come on down with me.

575
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.520
Ladies. I want yous
to move over here.

576
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.920
Are yous ready? ALL: Yeah!

577
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.640
I've never done this before.
but now that I'm here.
there's no turning back.

578
00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.520
I'm just glad Serena's there
to look after me in the water.

579
00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.760
It's quite overwhelming.
It is. Quite emotional. It is.
But it's really. really class.

580
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.720
It just... It's like mindfulness.
It's forced mindfulness.

581
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.280
Cos the only thing
you can concentrate on
is the cold in your body.

582
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.600
It just feels well euphoric.
It does. Doesn't it?

583
00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:53.360
It's all spiritual. It is. It is.
It's overwhelming. but it's class.

584
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.920
You've actually done it. Thank you.
It was so brilliant. I'm so glad
you invited me. Thank you.

585
00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.360
I'm glad you did it. Well done.

586
00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.360
I was really terrified
at the start.

587
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.120
It's kind of like there's literally
nothing else to think about.

588
00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:12.000
And it's really. really. really hard
to empty your brain of thoughts
and worries.

589
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.280
I think I will do it again.
I do. I think I'll do it again.

590
00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.520
Like lots of the people I met
on the beach today.

591
00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.200
I'm working through
my own experiences.

592
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.000
Serena and her amazing community

593
00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.400
are doing their bit to support
each other and stay positive.

594
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.840
And that's something
Derry is very good at.

595
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:41.800
But it's not always easy
because there can still be
outbreaks of violence here

596
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.880
that wouldn't be normal
in other parts of the UK.

597
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.320
In 2019. Belfast-born journalist
Lyra McKee was shot

598
00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.600
while observing rioting in Derry.

599
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.960
She died later in hospital.

600
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.920
Obviously it was shocking
that somebody had died.

601
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.880
and obviously it was heartbreaking
and should never have happened.

602
00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:14.840
The fact that there was unrest in
that part of Derry wasn't shocking.

603
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.280
in any part of Derry.
I'm sure people in Belfast
or whatever will tell you the same.

604
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.440
it's not that it's overly shocking.
There's still civil unrest here.
There just is.

605
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.800
Lyra was killed
on the Creggan estate.
not far from where I grew up.

606
00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:33.600
Here tensions remain between
some of the residents and the place.

607
00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.480
I've arranged to catch up with
Jordan. one of the girls I met
earlier in my old school.

608
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.880
to find out
what life's like here now.

609
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.880
Hey. What's the craic? Lovely to see
you. Good to see you again.

610
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.080
Out of your uniform.
I know. It's great.

611
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.320
How long have you lived in Creggan?
Oh. my whole life.

612
00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:58.040
It's a real sense of community.
I used to hang around here when I
was younger. I grew up beside here.

613
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.960
I know Creggan well. A lot of my
family and friends are from there.

614
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.080
I hung around there. grew up there.

615
00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.440
Had a couple of sneaky
alcoholic beverages there
when I was too young.

616
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.600
We used to hang around sort of
the youth clubs and stuff.
like St Mary's and stuff. Aye.

617
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.480
Do you still do that?
What's it like now for young people?

618
00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.280
Erm. St Mary's actually got done up.
Oh. did it?
Aye. It's massive looking now.

619
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:21.520
They've put loads
of new equipment in it. Obviously.
you ran round here. as well.

620
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.640
I did. What was it
that you would have done?

621
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.840
I don't think
we can say it on camera.
THEY LAUGH

622
00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.880
Obviously. like a lot of estates
in a lot of places.

623
00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.520
there's some negative
as well as the positive. Yeah.

624
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.840
And obviously we know
what's happened with Lyra McKee.

625
00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.120
Have you noticed.
from younger to now.
a difference in police presence?

626
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.520
Obviously.
there is a police presence.

627
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.360
but there's a police presence
everywhere you go in Derry. Mm.

628
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:51.640
It's never been. like. scary
or. like. extra violent.
except for obviously what happened.

629
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.920
If anything. I think it kind of
just brought the community
closer together. Right.

630
00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.720
There was a vigil down there for her
and I think the whole of Creggan
had come out of their houses

631
00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.280
and had come down and had stood
and had prayed for her.

632
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.360
Do you think that there's
a fair representation of Creggan
in the media at the moment?

633
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:14.040
I think sometimes Creggan
can get a wee bit of an unfair
viewpoint from some people.

634
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.640
It's not every single day
something like that happens.
That was really. really... random

635
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.760
and out of the blue.
and nothing like that
has ever happened in my lifetime.

636
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.720
You feel quite safe.

637
00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.440
There's a plane. That's what it is.
Paps in Creggan.

638
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:34.640
I'm keen to know whether Jordan will
stay in Derry after her A-levels.

639
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.080
Both of us went to St Cecilia's.
which is school on Creggan.
I know there's more.

640
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.320
but I feel like the schools.
especially the girls schools
in Derry.

641
00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.920
they really set women up
for hopefully a brighter future.

642
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.680
What do you see for your future?
What's the plans for Jordan?

643
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.640
I have applied to uni in Leeds
to do mental health and counselling.

644
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.520
cos I wanna go on to be
a rehabilitation counsellor

645
00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.600
and come back and work in Derry.
Cos I feel like Derry needs it.

646
00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.560
Just experience something else
and bring back all the experiences.
Aye. Definitely.

647
00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:08.600
Obviously. you'll meet new friends
from different backgrounds
and different cultures.

648
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.760
Would you be keen to bring them
back to show them Derry?
Oh. 100 percent.

649
00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.800
I'm proud of Derry. They're gonna be
told about all the great things.

650
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.320
They're gonna be told about
Halloween and St Patrick's Day

651
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.280
and about how Derry
has so many things to offer people.

652
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.680
Mad about it.
Right. thank you so much.

653
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.560
I couldn't agree more.
And with young women like Jordan

654
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.960
keen to make her city
a better place.

655
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.120
I feel like Derry's future
is looking bright.

656
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.680
ALL: Happy St Patrick's Day!

657
00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.360
St Patrick's Day is a celebration
of Irish culture for everybody.

658
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:55.680
Everybody wants to celebrate it
and take part. It's all inclusive.

659
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.280
Hello! How are you?
Hi. Julie. what's the craic?

660
00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.800
Of all the people
I've met during filming.

661
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.880
I'm most surprised to bump into
Julie from the flute band.

662
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.760
Because not all Protestants
celebrate Ireland's patron saint.

663
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.720
Love the green. Thank you. It's like
a stylish Paddy's Day. isn't it?

664
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.560
How are yous guys? We're very good.

665
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.240
While she's been in the town
on St Patrick's Day before.

666
00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.880
this is the first time Julie
has been to watch the parade.

667
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.600
Just with the whole. the fact that
this is obviously tricolours.

668
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.880
does that bother you at all.
or is it something
that you're really happy about?

669
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.320
It doesn't bother me.
cos when we're at the 12th of July.
it's Union flags.

670
00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.040
When you're down here.
it's tricolours everywhere.
It doesn't really matter to me.

671
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.520
In what way do you think Paddy's Day
compares to the 12th?
Or is it really similar?

672
00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.680
You know. it's packed.
there's so many people about.
you get to interact with people.

673
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.600
it's so similar what they actually
are and what you do on the day.

674
00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.560
It's just sort of
different sides of one coin.

675
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:53.360
It was genuinely lovely to see yous.
I hope you have a great day
and get your well-deserved pints.

676
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.440
Julie's positivity about our city
is infectious.

677
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.080
And on a day like today.
with the sun shining.

678
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.520
I'm proud to call myself
a Derry girl.

679
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.680
Mind you. I'm still working through
my own feelings

680
00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.600
about growing up in this brilliant
but complicated wee place.

681
00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.600
But I'm more convinced than ever
that there will be a bright future
for all of us.

682
00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.920
I just feel like
Derry's gonna be booming.

683
00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:27.200
I've got so much positive
expectations of Derry.

684
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.000
I think there does seem to be
this thing of people are realising

685
00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.560
you don't always have to leave Derry
to become something.

686
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.960
And if you do. you can always
come back and bring it back.

687
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.320
And that the older you get.
again. from my own perspective.

688
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.560
the more I realise that the Derry
community is responsible. in a large
way. to who I am and my success.

689
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.560
But the fact that
we're able to get where we are
with the lack of resources.

690
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.800
can you imagine what we could do
if we were fully resourced?

691
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.440
Can you imagine what Derry people
could achieve?

692
00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:01.560
