00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.583
- Get on the ground!
- Freeze! Police!

Freeze!

(woman chuckles)

12
00:03:43.257 --> 00:03:44.492
- What?

13
00:03:44.492 --> 00:03:45.959
- [Woman] I thought we
said no tree this year.

14
00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.895
- Come on. will you look at it?

15
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:49.730
The ornaments. the lights.

16
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.899
Look. I can make
'em change color.

17
00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:53.334
Plus. the smell.

18
00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:56.103
- It's a fake tree.
- Well. yeah. I know that.

19
00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:57.771
I mean. you can pretend. right?

20
00:03:57.771 --> 00:03:59.607
- Sure it smells like the attic.

21
00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:00.408
- Stop.

22
00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:03.176
Will you get into
the spirit of things?

23
00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:04.612
- Yay.

24
00:04:04.612 --> 00:04:05.446
- Whatever.

25
00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:10.250
So. steaks tonight?

26
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.486
- (chuckles) We can
afford steaks again?

27
00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:15.188
- Oh. but I want 'em so bad!

28
00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:16.657
- Just three more weeks. okay?

29
00:04:16.657 --> 00:04:18.091
(doorbell rings)

30
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.660
- [Man] Yeah. until
you're fired or you quit.

31
00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:26.266
- What is it?
(door closes)

32
00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:30.237
- Don't know. it's just
addressed to some guy named Max.

33
00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:31.905
Must be the wrong
house. I guess.

34
00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:42.950
- Don't.
(husband sighs)

35
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.784
I'm trying.

36
00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:46.086
- I just want you to be happy.

37
00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:47.855
so. if that means
quitting your job.

38
00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.623
- I'm happy.
- Sure.

39
00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:50.624
- I'm happy.

40
00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:53.994
- [Husband] Oh. man. We
really gotta fix this.

41
00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:55.162
- [Wife] What?

42
00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:58.932
- This door opened when we
opened the front door again.

43
00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.235
So many stupid things in
this place we gotta fix.

44
00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:05.305
- Any luck today?

45
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.608
- Oh. not really.

46
00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:09.109
- And you want me to be happy.

47
00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:13.481
- I'm happy. I'm
just out of work.

48
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:14.982
There's a difference.

49
00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:16.717
- [Wife] Yeah. well you
can't buy health insurance

50
00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:18.118
with happiness. though.

51
00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:19.420
- I'm not planning
on getting hurt.

52
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.988
Are you planning
on getting hurt?

53
00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:23.557
- [Wife] That's
not how this works.

54
00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:26.427
- Too bad. because
with your background

55
00:05:26.427 --> 00:05:29.296
and my awesome cardio
abilities. we'd be set.

56
00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:31.765
They should actually pay
us for our healthiness.

57
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.169
Something wrong?

58
00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:40.340
- Just the usual BS.

59
00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:44.177
So the new thing is
they're not telling anyone.

60
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.481
If they get caught.
it is all going under.

61
00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:48.749
- First of all.

62
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:50.751
I don't think you should
be telling all of this.

63
00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:55.088
Second. I don't understand this

64
00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.391
daddy/daughter
management team thing.

65
00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.160
It's such a bad idea.

66
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.431
- I don't know. I mean.
strength in numbers. right?

67
00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:05.399
- Family does not count in that.

68
00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:07.267
- (scoffs) How so?

69
00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:08.936
- Could you imagine us
doing something like that?

70
00:06:08.936 --> 00:06:09.870
Running a company?

71
00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.474
We would butt heads and drive
that thing into the ground.

72
00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:15.609
- Yeah. maybe us. but
that's just because

73
00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:18.546
someone can't handle
living with an ex-sergeant.

74
00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:19.379
- Whatever.

75
00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:22.483
- Regardless. I don't think
it's the family situation

76
00:06:22.483 --> 00:06:23.451
driving them down.

77
00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:26.286
It's the lying.

78
00:06:26.286 --> 00:06:27.755
- Well. yeah. Sure. that too.

79
00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:31.291
I mean. you definitely
can't just sell off stock.

80
00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:32.125
- Stop.

81
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.094
- What?

82
00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.000
You really think someone's
listening out there?

83
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.369
- I don't know. I just
don't wanna chance it.

84
00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:45.105
So. don't talk about it. please.

85
00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:47.340
- [Husband] Oh. I mean. you
trust your husband or you don't.

86
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.341
- It's not that.

87
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.345
It's just either I risk saying
something and losing this job

88
00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:56.316
or saying nothing and
this entire company
goes up in flames.

89
00:06:56.316 --> 00:06:59.553
- Or. or you say nothing
and in four weeks.

90
00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:02.756
you get that promotion that
you've been waiting on.

91
00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.257
- Yeah.

92
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.760
(door creaks)

93
00:07:07.628 --> 00:07:09.229
- What?

94
00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.031
- [Wife] I don't know if
that's even a thing anymore.

95
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:12.332
It's all so up in the air.

96
00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:17.137
- Up in the air how?
Like. 80-40. 70-30?

97
00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:18.872
- Like 80-20.

98
00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:21.742
- That's great odds.
- 80 losing. 20 winning.

99
00:07:21.742 --> 00:07:23.644
I don't know. there's an
entire shakeup going on.

100
00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:25.913
The fifth floor is
nervous. it's just...

101
00:07:27.014 --> 00:07:28.048
It's just a feeling.

102
00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:31.519
- I'm sure you'll be okay.

103
00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:33.954
- I'm not just looking for okay.

104
00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:38.325
Four years and
sometimes I feel like

105
00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:39.793
you don't even know who I am.

106
00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:44.632
(footsteps clack)

107
00:07:44.632 --> 00:07:46.834
- When I finally master
my telepathic abilities.

108
00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:47.735
I'll let you know.

109
00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:53.306
(watch bleeps)

110
00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:56.376
(suspenseful music)

111
00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:58.979
(light buzzes)

112
00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:56.169
(muffled clunks)

113
00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:09.282
(muffled clunks)

114
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.455
(muffled clunks)

115
00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:34.507

(music intensifies)

117
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:53.460
(music softens)

118
00:10:57.524 --> 00:10:58.658
- [Husband] Who
the hell are you?

119
00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.027
What're you doing in my house?

120
00:11:00.027 --> 00:11:01.729
- [Intruder] I'm really
sorry. just please.

121
00:11:01.729 --> 00:11:03.764
(muffled chatter)

122
00:11:03.764 --> 00:11:06.099
- [Husband] What're you doing
in my house? Where's Heather?

123
00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:07.600
- Stay there!
- No. you need to leave!

124
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.804
(muffled yelling)

125
00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:12.005
- Mark!

126
00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:15.008
- Get outta here!
- Please stop yelling!

127
00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:18.979
- [Mark] Get outta here!
Get outta my house!

128
00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:20.347
- Mark!

129
00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:23.450
- Where is it?
- Where is what?

130
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.786
(gun fires)

131
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:33.393
(tense music)

132
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:43.136
(grunts)

133
00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:44.337
- You okay?
- Yeah.

134
00:11:44.337 --> 00:11:45.505
- Wait. wait!
- Get up. let's go.

135
00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:47.707
- Wait. wait!
- Mark. call the cops.

136
00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.343
- Please. I've gotta figure
out. (groans) my leg!

137
00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:55.315
- Get up!

138
00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:58.218
- I'll pay you $10.000
if you let me go!

139
00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:00.788
- What do you mean. $10.000?

140
00:12:00.788 --> 00:12:02.722
- Mark. phone them.

141
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.292
- I'm just gonna
get up. (grunts)

142
00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:07.961
I'm just gonna get up.
I need to look around.

143
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:09.596
- Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!

144
00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:10.864
- Please let me get-
- Stop. stop!

145
00:12:10.864 --> 00:12:13.200
(gun fires)

146
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.441
- What did you do?

147
00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:24.377
- Shit.

148
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:29.016
Shit.

149
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.252
(pants)

150
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.059
(grunts)

151
00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.674
(pants)

152
00:13:03.216 --> 00:13:04.484
- [Mark] 10 grand.

153
00:13:04.484 --> 00:13:06.186
- Mark. quit screwing
around and call it in.

154
00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:07.787
- That's a lot of
money. don't you think?

155
00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.824
- I don't know. I don't
know. Just call the cops.

156
00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:13.126
- Listen. I think there's money

157
00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:15.162
hidden in our house somewhere.

158
00:13:15.162 --> 00:13:16.997
- Mark. just call
the cops! I can't.

159
00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:19.499
I am trying to figure out what
the hell just happened here.

160
00:13:19.499 --> 00:13:22.569
- Listen to me! There's
money in our house.

161
00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:23.636
I wanna find it!

162
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.409
Go clean up. okay?

163
00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:30.210
Hurry up! Do it!

164
00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:32.645
- Okay. okay.

165
00:13:35.282 --> 00:13:36.216
Oh. my god.

166
00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:41.321
(water splashes)

167
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.591
(muffled gunfire)

168
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:46.826
(loud gunfire from TV)

169
00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.295
What are you doing?

170
00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:49.562
- We've got about two
minutes before a neighbor

171
00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:51.198
or a cop comes by to
ask about gunshots.

172
00:13:51.198 --> 00:13:52.799
- Nancy's gone for the holidays.

173
00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:55.068
- I'm just planning
for whatever!

174
00:13:55.068 --> 00:13:55.869
- What?

175
00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:59.439
(Mark pants)

176
00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:02.009
Stop. Mark. have
you lost your mind?

177
00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:03.310
- I'm putting him on the tile.

178
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.811
- [Heather] You're
moving a body.

179
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:07.214
- [Mark] This guy offers
us 10 large. and (grunts).

180
00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:10.283
and he's digging
around the house.

181
00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:11.684
It's in here somewhere.

182
00:14:12.986 --> 00:14:14.854
Under the house.
maybe. I don't know.

183
00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:18.491
And if he's offering
us 10. that means

184
00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:20.760
there's enough to go around
for him to make a profit.

185
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.828
- No. that's theft.

186
00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:23.030
- He's dead.

187
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.631
- Mark. this is. this is insane.

188
00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:26.099
What are you thinking?

189
00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:27.734
- You did what you had to do.

190
00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:30.603
You protected me. you
protected yourself.

191
00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.839
Now. let's protect our future.

192
00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:36.143
We're gonna take one hour and
we're gonna find this stash.

193
00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:37.444
As soon as we find it.
we're gonna call it in.

194
00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:38.645
and we're gonna move on.

195
00:14:42.249 --> 00:14:43.083
We need this.

196
00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:46.553
It's one hour.

197
00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:50.523
The hospital bills.
the funeral bills.

198
00:14:50.523 --> 00:14:51.724
It'll all be paid for.

199
00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:52.960
- What happens
when we get caught

200
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.827
and we are shit out of
luck and we're in jail?

201
00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:56.429
- We're not gonna get caught.

202
00:14:58.098 --> 00:15:00.233
It's one hour. It's
no time at all.

203
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.442
- I already looked under the
house. there's nothing there.

204
00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:10.610
- Great.

205
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.545
That's one spot down.

206
00:15:12.545 --> 00:15:15.315
(doorbell rings)

207
00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:27.794
(muffled chatter from TV)
(somber music)

208
00:15:32.832 --> 00:15:35.168
Yeah. we got carried away.

209
00:15:35.168 --> 00:15:36.869
We're just watching a movie.

210
00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:39.439
Everything's fine.
Yeah. I apologize.

211
00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:41.975
- Have a good night.
- Have a good night.

212
00:15:41.975 --> 00:15:45.245
(door closes)

213
00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:46.079
Neighbor.

214
00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:48.515
- What next?

215
00:15:51.718 --> 00:15:52.785
- It's 11:05.

216
00:15:54.154 --> 00:15:56.023
We'll take until midnight
to search the house

217
00:15:56.023 --> 00:15:59.192
for the money he stashed.
then we call the cops.

218
00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:04.464
- One hour.
(suspenseful music)

219
00:16:25.552 --> 00:16:26.886
- I'm trying to
keep him in there.

220
00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:28.888
- What if someone
asks about the towels?

221
00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:33.826
- Um. we were trying to help
him and stop the bleeding.

222
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.069
Okay. let's get to work.

223
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.709
(rain splashes)

224
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.183
(suspenseful music)

225
00:17:00.653 --> 00:17:01.454
Not there.

226
00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:11.498
(rain splashes)

227
00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:27.914
(rain splashes)

228
00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:33.086
(ominous music)

229
00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:48.601
(melancholy music)

230
00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:54.141
I'm not finding anything.

231
00:17:54.141 --> 00:17:55.908
I've looked all over.

232
00:17:59.979 --> 00:18:00.780
You okay?

233
00:18:09.156 --> 00:18:11.758
Why do you do that to yourself?

234
00:18:14.861 --> 00:18:17.497
It's 30 minutes till midnight.
I say we look outside.

235
00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:22.235
Need a minute?

236
00:18:25.872 --> 00:18:28.775
(footsteps recede)

237
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.014
(rain splashes)

238
00:18:35.014 --> 00:18:37.083
(door creaks)

239
00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:38.285
- Anything?

240
00:18:38.285 --> 00:18:39.486
- [Mark] Huh?

241
00:18:39.486 --> 00:18:40.820
No. still nothing.

242
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.091
- (sighs) Any other ideas?

243
00:19:01.174 --> 00:19:02.675
How much crap do we own?

244
00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:07.480
(sighs)

245
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.915
(baseball bat clangs)

246
00:19:08.915 --> 00:19:10.016
Mark.

247
00:19:10.016 --> 00:19:11.284
- [Mark] Sorry.

248
00:19:16.723 --> 00:19:21.728
(tires screech)
(tense music)

249
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:29.035
- Don't.

250
00:19:35.074 --> 00:19:40.079
(suspenseful music)
(rain splashes)

251
00:19:43.883 --> 00:19:47.153
- [Mark] What else
could we be missing?

252
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.202
- I told you I already looked.
There's nothing down here.

253
00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:04.904
- Well. I'm gonna check again.

254
00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:15.948
- [Heather] Told you.

255
00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:25.992
- Damn it.

256
00:20:29.028 --> 00:20:30.430
- I have an idea.

257
00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:35.635
- What now?

258
00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:41.240
- Just find his phone.
wallet. anything.

259
00:20:44.511 --> 00:20:46.813
Run your hands over the
outside of his clothes.

260
00:20:48.381 --> 00:20:50.783
(Mark sighs)

261
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.554
- No phone.

262
00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.025
- Turn him on his side.

263
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.663
(Mark grunts)

264
00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:05.932
- What the hell?

265
00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:07.967
No wallet.

266
00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:11.237
(grunts) Hang on.

267
00:21:14.907 --> 00:21:16.008
(ominous music)

268
00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:16.843
I got a...

269
00:21:18.345 --> 00:21:19.178
Two-way radio.

270
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.451
- Short range.

271
00:21:27.687 --> 00:21:32.692
- [Man Over Radio] Answer me!

272
00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:37.229
- Was he talking to him?

273
00:21:38.598 --> 00:21:39.832
- I don't know.

274
00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:42.335
- He could've been
talking to anybody.

275
00:21:45.505 --> 00:21:46.305
Turn it back on.

276
00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.008
Go on. turn it on.

277
00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.714
(switch clicks)

278
00:21:54.714 --> 00:21:56.082
- [Man Over Radio]
You're supposed to work.

279
00:21:56.082 --> 00:21:59.586
You turn the knob.
you say some words.

280
00:21:59.586 --> 00:22:02.455
I say some words.
and then we talk.

281
00:22:02.455 --> 00:22:04.156
It's kind of like ping-pong.

282
00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:06.893
You hit. I hit. You hit. I hit.

283
00:22:08.928 --> 00:22:10.262
- Call the cops.

284
00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:25.277
(tense abrasive music)

285
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:38.190
(moans)
(somber music)

286
00:22:42.261 --> 00:22:44.163
(sobs)

287
00:22:57.977 --> 00:23:00.580
(Mark chuckles)

288
00:23:04.484 --> 00:23:07.820
(muffled rain splashes)

289
00:23:19.566 --> 00:23:21.968
(door slams)

290
00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:25.538
(door slams)

291
00:23:26.806 --> 00:23:30.209
- What're you doing?
- This frickin' door.

292
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.617
(thunder rumbles)

293
00:23:37.617 --> 00:23:39.786
(Mark sighs)

294
00:23:39.786 --> 00:23:42.455
- Listen. I know I've
said this 100 times. but.

295
00:23:44.491 --> 00:23:45.725
I'm so sorry.

296
00:23:51.698 --> 00:23:52.532
- I know.

297
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.042
(Mark sighs)

298
00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:09.081
- When the hell did we do that?

299
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:12.985
Can you hand me a towel?

300
00:24:19.759 --> 00:24:24.196
- At this rate. we're gonna
be running out of towels.

301
00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:34.707
- I thought we were doing
her some good. buying time.

302
00:24:34.707 --> 00:24:37.276
(watch bleeps)

303
00:24:41.514 --> 00:24:43.616
(sighs)

304
00:24:43.616 --> 00:24:45.017
It's midnight.

305
00:24:45.017 --> 00:24:46.553
- Did you call the police?

306
00:24:46.553 --> 00:24:48.054
- No.
- What?

307
00:24:48.054 --> 00:24:50.256
- Well. you were slamming
doors and it distracted me.

308
00:24:50.256 --> 00:24:52.158
- It's three numbers.
- I got nervous.

309
00:24:52.158 --> 00:24:53.660
- [Heather] Where's your phone?

310
00:24:55.928 --> 00:24:57.229
- It's in the bedroom.

311
00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:58.197
Wait.
- What?

312
00:25:01.067 --> 00:25:02.201
- We're so close.

313
00:25:03.803 --> 00:25:05.337
I really don't wanna think
about what's gonna happen

314
00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.607
next week when neither
of us have reliable jobs.

315
00:25:07.607 --> 00:25:10.076
- We'll be fine.
- No. we won't.

316
00:25:10.076 --> 00:25:13.713
I can't keep lying to myself.
(somber music)

317
00:25:16.048 --> 00:25:17.383
- It wasn't your fault.

318
00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:22.221
- If I had just. If I
had just been there.

319
00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:27.093
If I hadn't been late.

320
00:25:27.093 --> 00:25:28.260
- It wasn't your fault.

321
00:25:33.099 --> 00:25:35.902
- I can't keep
pretending that...

322
00:25:40.139 --> 00:25:40.973
- Okay.

323
00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:45.311
We haven't checked the
laundry room yet. have we?

324
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.115
- No.

325
00:25:49.982 --> 00:25:51.618
- Go get your phone.

326
00:25:51.618 --> 00:25:53.686
I'm gonna go check it
out. but that's it.

327
00:25:55.154 --> 00:25:57.223
There's something
strange happening.

328
00:25:57.223 --> 00:25:58.257
I don't wanna get
caught up in it.

329
00:25:58.257 --> 00:26:00.192
We have to be more careful.

330
00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:11.804
(Mark sighs)

331
00:26:29.055 --> 00:26:31.724
(rain splashes)

332
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.973
(can clacks)

333
00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:02.989
(door opens)

334
00:27:02.989 --> 00:27:04.556
(door creaks)

335
00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:06.192
- Parker.

336
00:27:06.192 --> 00:27:08.494
Are you in here?
(suspenseful music)

337
00:27:08.494 --> 00:27:10.062
You ain't turned your radio on.

338
00:27:13.132 --> 00:27:15.401
Is anyone else home?

339
00:27:15.401 --> 00:27:16.402
Come on out.

340
00:27:33.786 --> 00:27:35.788
(moans)

341
00:27:37.924 --> 00:27:40.893
Oh. now that's a cute
Charlie Brown Christmas tree.

342
00:27:40.893 --> 00:27:42.228
- There's someone in my house.

343
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.699
(intruder giggles)

344
00:27:46.699 --> 00:27:48.100
43 Carter Street.

345
00:27:55.842 --> 00:27:56.675
- Mm-hm.

346
00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:24.236
Jesus. Parker.

347
00:28:30.309 --> 00:28:31.610
Could someone handle this?

348
00:28:50.963 --> 00:28:52.598
(rain splashes)

349
00:28:52.598 --> 00:28:55.101
(door creaks)

350
00:28:59.271 --> 00:29:00.106
Oh.

351
00:29:01.373 --> 00:29:02.608
Hello.

352
00:29:02.608 --> 00:29:04.076
- What the fuck are
you doing in my house?

353
00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:05.878
- I'm looking for Parker.

354
00:29:05.878 --> 00:29:08.547
Have you seen him?
- I don't know who that is.

355
00:29:08.547 --> 00:29:10.249
- Mm.
- Where's my husband?

356
00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:12.351
- Husband? I've...

357
00:29:12.351 --> 00:29:14.320
I haven't seen him inside.

358
00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:17.824
There's an awful lot
of blood in there.

359
00:29:17.824 --> 00:29:19.225
Is everything okay?

360
00:29:19.225 --> 00:29:21.027
- Cops are out front.

361
00:29:21.027 --> 00:29:22.929
I wouldn't wanna be
here. if I were you.

362
00:29:22.929 --> 00:29:25.631
- (sighs) Well. you
don't even know me.

363
00:29:25.631 --> 00:29:27.466
But judging by the
bloody towels in there.

364
00:29:27.466 --> 00:29:29.869
I would say that you don't
wanna be here either.

365
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.105
Oh.

366
00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:33.940
Clever.

367
00:29:35.207 --> 00:29:36.675
Cocky.
- You need to leave.

368
00:29:38.644 --> 00:29:39.846
- Do I?

369
00:29:39.846 --> 00:29:41.981
- I pull the trigger.
we all go to jail.

370
00:29:41.981 --> 00:29:43.549
Problem solved.

371
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:44.783
- I don't think you would.

372
00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:47.019
- Well. I don't think
you wanna take that bet.

373
00:29:49.121 --> 00:29:51.257
- Those are some
very high stakes.

374
00:29:51.257 --> 00:29:54.861
- Walk away before
we attract the cops.

375
00:29:54.861 --> 00:29:56.528
(gun cocks)

376
00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:57.429
- Relax.

377
00:29:58.898 --> 00:30:00.900
If you see Parker.

378
00:30:02.101 --> 00:30:06.172
would you let him know
to turn his radio on?

379
00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:09.541
I'm looking for what he owes me.

380
00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:13.645
I'm gonna find it either way.

381
00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:19.451
It was very nice meeting you.

382
00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:21.153
And you.

383
00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:35.334
Have a nice night.

384
00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:38.704
Oh. yeah. and happy holidays.

385
00:30:49.215 --> 00:30:50.016
- Shit.

386
00:30:58.157 --> 00:30:58.958
Shit.

387
00:31:00.059 --> 00:31:00.792
- Mark.

388
00:31:02.328 --> 00:31:03.162
Mark.

389
00:31:04.796 --> 00:31:06.933
We gotta do something.

390
00:31:06.933 --> 00:31:08.334
- Yeah. but what?

391
00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:13.339
(phone vibrates)

392
00:31:17.409 --> 00:31:18.477
It's the police.

393
00:31:18.477 --> 00:31:20.112
- Answer.
- And tell them what?

394
00:31:20.112 --> 00:31:21.713
- That you misdialed.

395
00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:22.915
- [Mark] I sent them
to the house nextdoor.

396
00:31:22.915 --> 00:31:25.051
- Tell them that you
gave the wrong address.

397
00:31:25.051 --> 00:31:26.953
- That seems a bit
conspicuous. doesn't it?

398
00:31:26.953 --> 00:31:28.554
- Oh. god.

399
00:31:28.554 --> 00:31:30.289
You know what? We
need to turn in.

400
00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:31.924
It was self defense.
that's a fact. and besides.

401
00:31:31.924 --> 00:31:34.826
there is a guy watching us
and coming into our house.

402
00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:37.964
- Two hours ago. it was self
defense. Now it's murder!

403
00:31:37.964 --> 00:31:39.398
- [Heather] Yeah.
they don't know that.

404
00:31:41.033 --> 00:31:41.867
- He does.

405
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:45.671
He wants Parker in there
and he wants the money.

406
00:31:45.671 --> 00:31:47.073
- Exactly. The police
will protect us.

407
00:31:47.073 --> 00:31:48.874
We'll tell them exactly
what they need to know.

408
00:31:48.874 --> 00:31:51.377
We were invaded. it was self
defense. He offered us money.

409
00:31:51.377 --> 00:31:53.712
There's something in
this house that he wants.

410
00:31:53.712 --> 00:31:56.415
(phone vibrates)

411
00:32:01.787 --> 00:32:03.855
(knocks)

412
00:32:06.892 --> 00:32:08.594
- [Officer] Are you guy who
can't remember his own address?

413
00:32:08.594 --> 00:32:10.196
- Yeah. thanks for
coming. officer.

414
00:32:10.196 --> 00:32:12.064
No. we were woken
up by an intruder.

415
00:32:12.064 --> 00:32:13.832
Sir. he's in the bathroom.
- Whoa. whoa.

416
00:32:13.832 --> 00:32:14.733
Stay here. please.

417
00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:18.437
Are you two the owners
of this property?

418
00:32:18.437 --> 00:32:20.006
- Yes. sir.

419
00:32:20.006 --> 00:32:21.307
- Sir. I'm gonna need
you to step outside.

420
00:32:21.307 --> 00:32:22.975
Ma'am. over by the
windows. please.

421
00:32:22.975 --> 00:32:24.176
- Whoa. what's goin' on?

422
00:32:24.176 --> 00:32:26.512
There's a man in our
house. Shouldn't you be-

423
00:32:26.512 --> 00:32:29.315
- Sir. please don't tell
me how to do my job.

424
00:32:29.315 --> 00:32:30.616
I'm just trying
to protect myself

425
00:32:30.616 --> 00:32:32.184
and make sure I know
all the facts here.

426
00:32:32.184 --> 00:32:33.685
I don't know you and
I don't know her.

427
00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:36.288
so I don't know what's
fact or fiction here.

428
00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:37.123
You understand?

429
00:32:38.024 --> 00:32:39.591
- Yeah. yeah. that makes sense.

430
00:32:41.427 --> 00:32:42.361
- Now. where did you...

431
00:32:42.361 --> 00:32:45.031
(ominous music)

432
00:32:57.843 --> 00:32:59.178
(Mark pants)

433
00:32:59.178 --> 00:33:01.313
- [Mark] Stop the bleeding.

434
00:33:17.896 --> 00:33:19.498
- What're you doing?
Wait. stop. stop. stop.

435
00:33:19.498 --> 00:33:20.732
You're gonna fuck it up more.

436
00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:21.933
- What do you wanna
do. just let him die?

437
00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:23.602
- He's already dead.

438
00:33:26.372 --> 00:33:27.806
- Shit.

439
00:33:27.806 --> 00:33:28.640
Oh. shit.

440
00:33:42.221 --> 00:33:44.956
(Heather grunts)

441
00:33:46.292 --> 00:33:47.126
- Mark.

442
00:34:01.973 --> 00:34:04.376
(Mark pants)

443
00:34:10.316 --> 00:34:12.751
Wait. wait. wait. Do
you want to talk to him?

444
00:34:12.751 --> 00:34:16.688
- I don't think we have
a choice at this point.

445
00:34:18.824 --> 00:34:21.393
(radio bleeps)

446
00:34:25.697 --> 00:34:28.600
- [Man] Do I finally have a
friend to play telephone with?

447
00:34:30.569 --> 00:34:31.403
Hello?

448
00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:34.240
Answer me!

449
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.874
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm here.

450
00:34:37.209 --> 00:34:40.078
- [Man] Marky. Good
to hear from you. sir.

451
00:34:42.348 --> 00:34:43.949
- How do you know my name?

452
00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:46.452
- [Man] I'm gonna lay
down some ground rules.

453
00:34:46.452 --> 00:34:48.787
Numero uno. shut up.

454
00:34:48.787 --> 00:34:51.022
And the rest I'll
make up along the way.

455
00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:53.058
Now. Parker is gone.

456
00:34:53.058 --> 00:34:54.693
Self defense. I get it.

457
00:34:55.861 --> 00:34:58.530
But now there's a dead
cop in there somewhere.

458
00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:59.698
and there's a car out here.

459
00:34:59.698 --> 00:35:01.066
sitting out in
front of your house.

460
00:35:01.066 --> 00:35:02.701
I didn't wanna draw
attention to you.

461
00:35:02.701 --> 00:35:05.171
so I shut it down
and it's dark again.

462
00:35:05.171 --> 00:35:06.972
- There's more and they're
gonna come after him.

463
00:35:06.972 --> 00:35:08.974
- [Man] Not if they
think he's fine.

464
00:35:08.974 --> 00:35:11.243
I can keep 'em at
bay. but not for long.

465
00:35:11.243 --> 00:35:13.845
So. now you have
two bodies in there.

466
00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:15.347
and no way to explain that.

467
00:35:15.347 --> 00:35:18.317
I propose that I come over
there and keep searching

468
00:35:18.317 --> 00:35:21.587
for my belongings that
Parker left. capisce?

469
00:35:21.587 --> 00:35:23.121
- You come in this house.

470
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:25.824
I swear I will put more lead
in you than I did your boy.

471
00:35:25.824 --> 00:35:27.993
- [Man] Heather.
relax. It's Christmas.

472
00:35:27.993 --> 00:35:29.094
I just want what is mine.

473
00:35:29.094 --> 00:35:30.862
- And what is that?

474
00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:33.131
- [Man] You think I'd
tell you? No. honey.

475
00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:36.034
I can't have you getting
any wrong ideas about me.

476
00:35:36.034 --> 00:35:38.604
Well. aside from the
whole cop-killer thing.

477
00:35:38.604 --> 00:35:40.472
But. in truth. that
wasn't even me.

478
00:35:40.472 --> 00:35:42.374
That was my pal Tom here.

479
00:35:42.374 --> 00:35:43.575
Say hey. Tom.

480
00:35:49.381 --> 00:35:50.216
- Shoot me.

481
00:35:52.384 --> 00:35:54.019
Come on.

482
00:35:54.019 --> 00:35:54.853
Do it.

483
00:35:56.622 --> 00:35:58.224
- [Man] Don't test me.

484
00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:01.793
- And what if you miss?

485
00:36:02.928 --> 00:36:04.496
You really wanna wake
up the neighbors?

486
00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:05.997
- [Man] Just leave!

487
00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:07.733
What is wrong with you people?

488
00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:09.568
- I swear. no matter how
much you try to scare us.

489
00:36:09.568 --> 00:36:11.537
you are not getting
in this house.

490
00:36:12.638 --> 00:36:14.105
- [Man] I wouldn't
expect any other answer

491
00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:15.574
from you. sergeant.

492
00:36:15.574 --> 00:36:17.376
Well. ex-sergeant.

493
00:36:18.244 --> 00:36:19.878
- Fuck you.

494
00:36:19.878 --> 00:36:23.215
- [Man] So foul! Someone's
got a touchy spot!

495
00:36:23.215 --> 00:36:25.351
I can't imagine you
being soft. honestly.

496
00:36:25.351 --> 00:36:28.019
You've killed a man
already tonight!

497
00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:29.588
Hm. not to mention
all those soldiers

498
00:36:29.588 --> 00:36:30.989
you killed back in Iraq.

499
00:36:30.989 --> 00:36:33.725
- We defended ourselves.
you're a murderer.

500
00:36:33.725 --> 00:36:35.227
- [Man] Sure.

501
00:36:35.227 --> 00:36:37.696
Listen. I truly hope that you
continue to defend yourself.

502
00:36:37.696 --> 00:36:41.300
After all. that is
the American way.

503
00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.835
But that doesn't change the fact

504
00:36:43.835 --> 00:36:46.305
that you have
something that is mine!

505
00:36:47.439 --> 00:36:48.707
I'll see you soon.

506
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:53.879
(switch clicks)

507
00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:03.555
- What did he mean?

508
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.696
I guess we're back
to square one.

509
00:37:10.696 --> 00:37:13.565
- Square one was
before I shot a guy.

510
00:37:35.186 --> 00:37:37.789
(somber music)

511
00:38:10.055 --> 00:38:15.060
(radio bleeps)
(suspenseful music)

512
00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:17.929
- Hello?

513
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.668
- [Man] Mark.

514
00:38:22.668 --> 00:38:23.669
What's up. man?

515
00:38:32.978 --> 00:38:34.245
- Uh. I wanna talk.

516
00:38:36.114 --> 00:38:37.616
- [Man] Fantastic. let's meet.

517
00:38:38.784 --> 00:38:40.586
- How do we get out
of here alive without

518
00:38:40.586 --> 00:38:41.687
ending up behind bars?

519
00:38:42.954 --> 00:38:44.956
- [Man] Hm. that's a tall order.

520
00:38:47.125 --> 00:38:48.927
- Listen. I'm no soldier.

521
00:38:48.927 --> 00:38:52.931
I'm just some guy and I just
wanna forget about all this.

522
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:54.500
- [Man] You pansy baby.

523
00:38:55.901 --> 00:38:58.437
You're talking quietly 'cause
Mrs. Barns clearly doesn't

524
00:38:58.437 --> 00:39:01.740
know what you're up to and now
you're belittling yourself.

525
00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.809
Where's the confidence?

526
00:39:03.809 --> 00:39:05.977
- I just want this to be over.

527
00:39:05.977 --> 00:39:07.513
- [Man] Here's what
I'll tell you. Marky.

528
00:39:07.513 --> 00:39:10.382
For you. I will talk to a
few officers that I know.

529
00:39:10.382 --> 00:39:12.418
and I'll see if I can get you
off the hook for the whole

530
00:39:12.418 --> 00:39:15.787
murder thing and
then for killing the
poor defenseless cop.

531
00:39:15.787 --> 00:39:17.623
- We didn't kill that
cop and you know that.

532
00:39:17.623 --> 00:39:20.426
- [Man] I don't know anything!
You can't prove anything!

533
00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:23.729
My friend. the simple
fact of the matter is

534
00:39:23.729 --> 00:39:25.230
you two know too much.

535
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.732
I can't guarantee anything.

536
00:39:27.866 --> 00:39:29.300
- I don't know shit.

537
00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.369
I don't even know what
you're looking for anymore.

538
00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:34.039
- [Man] And I think we
should keep it that way.

539
00:39:34.039 --> 00:39:37.909
If you two can just
come outside. we can
put an end to this.

540
00:39:37.909 --> 00:39:40.679
We'll find the. what we need.

541
00:39:40.679 --> 00:39:43.081
and we'll figure out
what we need to do next.

542
00:39:44.249 --> 00:39:45.617
- You're not gonna
let us go. are you?

543
00:39:45.617 --> 00:39:47.686
- [Man] I don't
like to lie. Mark.

544
00:39:48.654 --> 00:39:50.188
Just come out.

545
00:39:50.188 --> 00:39:52.591
Don't let another member
of your family die.

546
00:39:52.591 --> 00:39:54.993
You don't have to be the cause
of your wife's death. too.

547
00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:57.663
(switch clicks)

548
00:40:05.904 --> 00:40:07.473
(Mark sighs)

549
00:40:07.473 --> 00:40:09.541
- It's the only room in the
house without a dead guy in it.

550
00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:10.876
- I thought I heard talking.

551
00:40:17.182 --> 00:40:20.519
- What the hell are we gonna do?

552
00:40:20.519 --> 00:40:21.953
- I don't know.

553
00:40:21.953 --> 00:40:24.022
- What do you mean?
Are we out of moves?

554
00:40:24.022 --> 00:40:25.491
- [Heather] I don't know.

555
00:40:25.491 --> 00:40:27.325
- Jesus. Heather. I'm just
looking for like a little bit

556
00:40:27.325 --> 00:40:29.895
of comfort here or like
an ounce of hope. maybe?

557
00:40:29.895 --> 00:40:32.163
And all you can give
me is "I don't know?"

558
00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:35.166
Like. I get that you are
living with whatever shit that

559
00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:37.135
you went through. but guess
what. I didn't go to war but

560
00:40:37.135 --> 00:40:40.071
I went through some shit too
and I have to live with that.

561
00:40:40.071 --> 00:40:45.043
And maybe you see that
sometimes. but at least I try.

562
00:40:46.211 --> 00:40:48.780
I try to help and to
give you what you need.

563
00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:51.683
I love you. Heather.

564
00:40:51.683 --> 00:40:53.184
I really do.

565
00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:57.222
But it gets harder
and harder every day

566
00:40:57.222 --> 00:41:00.191
that you bottle that shit up
and don't talk to me about it!

567
00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:02.327
- I can't talk about
this right now.

568
00:41:02.327 --> 00:41:05.030
That's not how this
works. this is how I cope.

569
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:06.698
I'm sorry if that
hurts your feelings.

570
00:41:06.698 --> 00:41:07.999
I really don't mean it to.

571
00:41:09.901 --> 00:41:11.369
- You're a sergeant.

572
00:41:11.369 --> 00:41:13.605
It's your job to lead people
and to move us forward.

573
00:41:15.073 --> 00:41:17.509
And it'd be really helpful if
you could just help me come up

574
00:41:17.509 --> 00:41:21.613
with some vague notion of a
plan otherwise what're we doing?

575
00:41:21.613 --> 00:41:22.447
- I don't know. Mark.
what are we doing?

576
00:41:24.115 --> 00:41:26.417
- We're. we're fighting
our way out of this shit.

577
00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:28.887
because we have a daughter
that we owe our lives to!

578
00:41:28.887 --> 00:41:31.389
- She's gone.
- Fuck. I know that!

579
00:41:32.357 --> 00:41:33.759
I got her killed!

580
00:41:34.626 --> 00:41:36.227
And I have to live with that!

581
00:41:38.063 --> 00:41:41.166
Some semblance of compassion
from you would be helpful!

582
00:41:41.166 --> 00:41:44.369
- Compassion? That's what you
wanna talk about right now?

583
00:41:44.369 --> 00:41:46.437
I killed someone tonight.

584
00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:49.107
and all of this is a little
too much for me right now.

585
00:41:53.645 --> 00:41:54.445
- Yeah.

586
00:41:55.413 --> 00:41:56.214
Sorry.

587
00:41:59.184 --> 00:42:00.451
I'm just scared.

588
00:42:02.821 --> 00:42:03.655
- Yeah.

589
00:42:05.724 --> 00:42:07.158
We have to fix this.

590
00:42:13.665 --> 00:42:15.166
- Why don't we just
sneak out the back door

591
00:42:15.166 --> 00:42:16.768
and not come back?

592
00:42:16.768 --> 00:42:19.605
- Where are we supposed
to go? (chuckles)

593
00:42:20.438 --> 00:42:21.272
With what money?

594
00:42:22.708 --> 00:42:25.343
There is someone probably
watching our back door.

595
00:42:25.343 --> 00:42:27.613
- Then we'll call for
backup on the cop's radio.

596
00:42:27.613 --> 00:42:30.381
We can explain it.
- We'll be in jail in an hour.

597
00:42:33.318 --> 00:42:34.620
- [Mark] (sighs) What do we do?

598
00:42:38.757 --> 00:42:39.591
- I don't know.

599
00:42:42.728 --> 00:42:47.733
(muffled gunshots)
(suspenseful music)

600
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:05.483
- Radio.

601
00:43:10.889 --> 00:43:13.491
(radio bleeps)

602
00:43:13.491 --> 00:43:14.893
- [Man] You just met Tom.

603
00:43:14.893 --> 00:43:17.428
Congrats. yeah. he's lovely.

604
00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:18.964
We assumed you
wouldn't shoot him.

605
00:43:18.964 --> 00:43:22.400
'cause that would be too loud
and we'd be forced to come in

606
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.035
and it would just be a big mess.

607
00:43:24.035 --> 00:43:27.105
Kinda like an arrow
through a cop.

608
00:43:27.105 --> 00:43:30.842
and then how would you
explain all those 9mm rounds?

609
00:43:30.842 --> 00:43:32.978
(laughs)

610
00:43:32.978 --> 00:43:34.245
- I wanna meet.

611
00:43:34.245 --> 00:43:35.647
Backyard. 10 minutes.

612
00:43:36.514 --> 00:43:38.049
- [Man] I don't see why not.

613
00:43:38.049 --> 00:43:40.686
It's not like you're gonna
shoot me out in the yard.

614
00:43:40.686 --> 00:43:41.920
Too noisy.

615
00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.055
I'll see you at 2:30.

616
00:43:44.055 --> 00:43:47.492
- We step outside he's gonna
shoot us with a frickin' arrow.

617
00:43:47.492 --> 00:43:48.960
- He's not gonna kill us.

618
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.796
- [Mark] How can you be so sure?

619
00:43:50.796 --> 00:43:51.997
- I'm gonna make a deal.

620
00:43:53.231 --> 00:43:54.365
- What kind of deal?

621
00:43:56.434 --> 00:44:01.339
(rain splashes)
(suspenseful music)

622
00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.481
- Hello. friends.

623
00:44:12.283 --> 00:44:14.753
You won't. so don't even
bother threatening me.

624
00:44:17.823 --> 00:44:19.624
- I called to offer you a deal.

625
00:44:19.624 --> 00:44:21.526
- What is this. the
deal making business?

626
00:44:21.526 --> 00:44:23.461
You have what is
mine and I want it.

627
00:44:23.461 --> 00:44:25.563
- Yeah. we found it but we're
not gonna give it to you

628
00:44:25.563 --> 00:44:28.166
until you tell us
what we need to know.

629
00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:29.167
- And what might that be?

630
00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:31.102
- Who put it in my house?

631
00:44:31.102 --> 00:44:33.204
- Parker did.
- Why?

632
00:44:33.204 --> 00:44:35.240
- Oh. well. because he's
a lying piece of shit.

633
00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.474
and he stole it from us.

634
00:44:36.474 --> 00:44:38.376
Now can we just please get-
- Shut up.

635
00:44:38.376 --> 00:44:39.344
I'm not finished.

636
00:44:40.578 --> 00:44:42.714
Why go through
all this for that?

637
00:44:42.714 --> 00:44:45.917
- (chuckles) Well. because it's
worth a whole lot of money.

638
00:44:45.917 --> 00:44:46.952
Why else?

639
00:44:47.786 --> 00:44:48.619
Oh.

640
00:44:49.821 --> 00:44:50.756
You don't have it.

641
00:44:50.756 --> 00:44:51.589
- We have it.

642
00:44:52.958 --> 00:44:55.426
- You don't have it.
because if you did have it.

643
00:44:55.426 --> 00:44:57.295
then you would know how
much money it's worth.

644
00:44:57.295 --> 00:44:59.497
and you two would be
trying to get going by now.

645
00:44:59.497 --> 00:45:00.766
- You didn't answer
the question.

646
00:45:00.766 --> 00:45:02.600
Why did Parker stash it here?

647
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.269
- Why don't we go in
there and ask him?

648
00:45:04.269 --> 00:45:05.136
- Oh. shit.

649
00:45:06.404 --> 00:45:08.106
I could have it.

650
00:45:08.106 --> 00:45:11.076
Or it might not even be here.

651
00:45:11.076 --> 00:45:12.210
You don't even know.

652
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:15.346
(man grunts)

653
00:45:15.346 --> 00:45:17.215
- You know what? Why don't
I just put you both down.

654
00:45:17.215 --> 00:45:19.517
And then I can go in this
house and search in peace.

655
00:45:19.517 --> 00:45:20.786
(whistles)
- I wouldn't.

656
00:45:23.955 --> 00:45:24.990
- And why wouldn't I?

657
00:45:26.892 --> 00:45:28.293
Oh.

658
00:45:28.293 --> 00:45:29.895
What is that. some
sort of trigger thingy

659
00:45:29.895 --> 00:45:32.463
where you can make this
house go kaboomy. and then...

660
00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:34.365
(chuckles)

661
00:45:34.365 --> 00:45:36.101
- I was a Navy EOD.

662
00:45:36.101 --> 00:45:38.169
That means I took apart bombs.

663
00:45:38.169 --> 00:45:39.805
That also means I
know how they work.

664
00:45:39.805 --> 00:45:41.840
and I know with enough
gasoline and other shit.

665
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.609
that little thing you're
looking for goes up in flames.

666
00:45:44.609 --> 00:45:47.045
(man laughs)

667
00:45:50.515 --> 00:45:54.219
- Mrs. Heather Barns
of 11-41 Carter Street.

668
00:45:54.219 --> 00:45:55.753
That's brilliant.

669
00:45:55.753 --> 00:45:57.923
Okay. say I believe
you. Now what?

670
00:45:57.923 --> 00:45:58.824
- Now you leave.

671
00:46:00.025 --> 00:46:02.327
(man grunts)

672
00:46:02.327 --> 00:46:05.096
- That's a nice
move. Barns family.

673
00:46:05.096 --> 00:46:06.898
Nice move!

674
00:46:06.898 --> 00:46:09.367
She's got balls. Mark.

675
00:46:09.367 --> 00:46:10.802
(laughs) Unlike you.

676
00:46:10.802 --> 00:46:13.438
- Shut up.
- What does he mean by that?

677
00:46:14.572 --> 00:46:16.107
- Oh. yeah. we
had a little chat.

678
00:46:16.107 --> 00:46:19.978
You know how much of a pussy
your husband is? (chuckles)

679
00:46:19.978 --> 00:46:21.279
And you're here protecting him.

680
00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:22.547
- Shut up!

681
00:46:22.547 --> 00:46:23.915
- He called me looking
for a way out of this.

682
00:46:23.915 --> 00:46:25.450
without you knowing. of course.

683
00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:29.087
and he was whining and crying
about how he's just some dude

684
00:46:29.087 --> 00:46:32.490
and he's not some
soldier! (laughs)

685
00:46:33.892 --> 00:46:36.161
Oh. it was pathetic.

686
00:46:36.161 --> 00:46:38.163
(sighs)

687
00:46:40.966 --> 00:46:43.201
Anyway. I'll leave you to it.

688
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.985
Loved it.

689
00:47:02.387 --> 00:47:03.221
No. Uncle.

690
00:47:05.056 --> 00:47:06.958
She had a bomby thingy.

691
00:47:08.259 --> 00:47:11.196
I. I don't need more guys.

692
00:47:11.196 --> 00:47:12.964
No. I don't need more guys!

693
00:47:15.033 --> 00:47:15.901
I'll find it!

694
00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:37.222
(cork squeaks)

695
00:47:40.959 --> 00:47:44.996
- That's not gonna help
you solve our problems.

696
00:47:44.996 --> 00:47:47.298
- [Heather] I'm not trying
to. It's just a drink.

697
00:47:49.334 --> 00:47:51.402
- Guess I'll figure this
out on my own. then.

698
00:47:51.402 --> 00:47:53.304
- What is your problem?

699
00:47:53.304 --> 00:47:54.940
You could sit here and find
your own shit way to deal

700
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.909
with your anxiety. but instead
you throw it all on me.

701
00:47:57.909 --> 00:47:59.110
I'm not your therapist.

702
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.246
- Well. that shouldn't
be your therapist.

703
00:48:01.246 --> 00:48:03.548
- It's just one drink.
- Yeah. one drink.

704
00:48:04.682 --> 00:48:06.484
Now. I'd like to
see you put it away.

705
00:48:06.484 --> 00:48:07.752
You know. better yet.

706
00:48:07.752 --> 00:48:09.254
I'd like to see you
pour out the bottle.

707
00:48:09.254 --> 00:48:11.189
I mean. how many times do
we have to go through this?

708
00:48:16.327 --> 00:48:17.162
- Screw you.

709
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.199
If I'm fine. I can
have a little drink.

710
00:48:21.199 --> 00:48:22.700
I'm gonna have a little drink.

711
00:48:24.169 --> 00:48:25.836
Maybe you should have one too.

712
00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:27.838
Help you get over
Lilly's death finally.

713
00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:29.774
- What did you say?

714
00:48:31.509 --> 00:48:32.610
You're over her?

715
00:48:34.379 --> 00:48:36.081
You can just move on
and get over the fact

716
00:48:36.081 --> 00:48:37.182
that our daughter's
gone forever?

717
00:48:37.182 --> 00:48:38.383
- That's not what I meant.

718
00:48:38.383 --> 00:48:40.118
- Oh. I hate that excuse.

719
00:48:40.118 --> 00:48:42.620
I don't see any other way
of taking that statement.

720
00:48:44.222 --> 00:48:45.623
You know. if you're over it.

721
00:48:47.392 --> 00:48:49.927
I guess we can get rid of the
rest of her stuff then. huh?

722
00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:51.162
- Stop!
- You're over it.

723
00:48:51.162 --> 00:48:52.663
We don't need this anymore.
- Stop it!

724
00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:54.132
- You're over it.
- No. stop it!

725
00:48:54.132 --> 00:48:55.633
- We don't need-
- Stop it!

726
00:48:57.969 --> 00:48:59.870
(sobs)

727
00:49:03.541 --> 00:49:04.542
Where is it?

728
00:49:16.154 --> 00:49:18.056
(sobs)

729
00:49:32.637 --> 00:49:34.005
I'm fine.

730
00:49:34.005 --> 00:49:35.173
I just. sorry.

731
00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:43.848
(sighs)

732
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:47.852
- It's too bad we're
not in a cartoon.

733
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.455
We could just get into a box

734
00:49:50.455 --> 00:49:52.523
and fill it with packing peanuts

735
00:49:52.523 --> 00:49:55.160
and ship ourselves out of
here right under their noses.

736
00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:57.162
(Heather chuckles)

737
00:49:57.162 --> 00:49:58.829
- That's a terrible idea.

738
00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:59.730
- (chuckles) Yeah.

739
00:50:04.502 --> 00:50:07.172
(Heather sighs)

740
00:50:09.574 --> 00:50:12.277
- No one knows where that
stash is. Why is that?

741
00:50:13.644 --> 00:50:15.913
What if Parker never
actually had left it here?

742
00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:18.983
- What do you mean?

743
00:50:18.983 --> 00:50:20.318
- What if he had it
shipped here later?

744
00:50:23.354 --> 00:50:24.922
- Wouldn't he remember?

745
00:50:24.922 --> 00:50:26.624
- We moved here.
what. a month ago?

746
00:50:26.624 --> 00:50:27.825
- [Mark] Yeah. roughly.

747
00:50:27.825 --> 00:50:28.793
- Yeah. he hid the money
a couple months ago.

748
00:50:28.793 --> 00:50:30.027
Maybe with that concussion.

749
00:50:30.027 --> 00:50:32.263
he forgot that he
had it shipped here.

750
00:50:32.263 --> 00:50:33.731
- Right.

751
00:50:33.731 --> 00:50:35.633
- It serves from the mail system
and no one has hands on it.

752
00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.143
(Mark sighs)

753
00:50:48.513 --> 00:50:49.947
- It was a long shot anyway.

754
00:50:51.582 --> 00:50:53.050
I'm sick of being at square one.

755
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:54.685
Like. when do we
get to square five?

756
00:50:54.685 --> 00:50:56.487
- I don't know but we
need to be proactive.

757
00:50:56.487 --> 00:50:58.356
I really don't wanna go to jail.

758
00:50:58.356 --> 00:51:00.591
- Yeah. or be dead.
- Yeah. that too.

759
00:51:02.293 --> 00:51:04.028
- Well. you've already scared
the shit out of everyone

760
00:51:04.028 --> 00:51:06.997
around you once tonight
with that fake bomb crap.

761
00:51:06.997 --> 00:51:09.534
- Yeah. well now you know
how I can defuse situations

762
00:51:09.534 --> 00:51:11.102
and avoid fights so well.

763
00:51:13.471 --> 00:51:14.939
- Did you just make a joke?

764
00:51:14.939 --> 00:51:15.773
- Maybe.

765
00:51:18.243 --> 00:51:19.777
- Wow.

766
00:51:19.777 --> 00:51:23.080
On the eve of our death. my
scary-ass wife makes a joke.

767
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.549
- Hey. I'm not scary.

768
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:26.951
- Woman. you have a fake
detonator that I don't doubt

769
00:51:26.951 --> 00:51:28.853
for a second you could make
real. if you wanted to.

770
00:51:28.853 --> 00:51:30.121
- It's true. I could.

771
00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:36.427
Well. I have something else
that's a little scarier

772
00:51:36.427 --> 00:51:38.829
and I can't believe
I'm suggesting this.

773
00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:40.097
- What?

774
00:51:40.097 --> 00:51:41.799
- I think we need
to move the cop.

775
00:51:43.601 --> 00:51:44.569
- Why?

776
00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:45.803
- We need to stage a scene.

777
00:51:45.803 --> 00:51:47.772
in case we need to talk
our way out of this.

778
00:51:47.772 --> 00:51:48.939
Maybe we can prove
something happened

779
00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.408
between him and Parker.

780
00:51:50.408 --> 00:51:52.377
- You really think we can
outsmart cop guys that are paid

781
00:51:52.377 --> 00:51:54.179
to know what kind of weapon
makes what kind of blood-

782
00:51:54.179 --> 00:51:55.680
- Do you wanna help
me figure this out.

783
00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.048
or do you wanna get screwed
in the shower later?

784
00:51:59.184 --> 00:52:00.918
By a man. in jail.

785
00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:06.524
(Mark sighs)

786
00:52:06.524 --> 00:52:07.358
- Fine.

787
00:52:09.694 --> 00:52:11.762
(grunts)

788
00:52:15.032 --> 00:52:16.066
- Give me the gun.

789
00:52:37.121 --> 00:52:38.723
- Wait a minute.

790
00:52:38.723 --> 00:52:39.990
- What?

791
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.192
- [Mark] How do we
explain the arrow?

792
00:52:42.793 --> 00:52:43.694
- Oh. shit.

793
00:52:46.096 --> 00:52:47.665
I don't know.

794
00:52:47.665 --> 00:52:48.733
I don't know.

795
00:52:50.134 --> 00:52:52.337
I am running on fumes.

796
00:52:56.374 --> 00:52:58.343
(sighs)

797
00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:00.778
What time is it?

798
00:53:02.079 --> 00:53:02.913
- 3:32.

799
00:53:05.149 --> 00:53:06.651
(Heather sighs)

800
00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:07.785
- I need a nap.

801
00:53:09.787 --> 00:53:11.489
- We go to sleep now.
they're gonna come in here

802
00:53:11.489 --> 00:53:12.790
and tear this place apart.

803
00:53:17.094 --> 00:53:17.928
- Yep.

804
00:53:18.963 --> 00:53:20.431
Yep.

805
00:53:20.431 --> 00:53:22.433
(sighs)

806
00:53:26.837 --> 00:53:28.973
We need to find this thing.

807
00:53:28.973 --> 00:53:32.243
(somber music)

808
00:53:32.243 --> 00:53:33.978
It's our only way out of here.

809
00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.556
- I need to get
out of this room.

810
00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.583
(suspenseful music)

811
00:57:33.117 --> 00:57:35.385
(sniffles)

812
00:57:48.766 --> 00:57:50.535
I can never let
this part of me go.

813
00:57:53.437 --> 00:57:56.607
If I just hadn't have
been late picking her up.

814
00:57:56.607 --> 00:57:58.809
- You can't predict when a
drunk driver's gonna run up

815
00:57:58.809 --> 00:58:00.578
onto a kerb and hurt someone.

816
00:58:00.578 --> 00:58:01.378
- No.

817
00:58:02.847 --> 00:58:06.951
No. but she could've been in
my car. far away from there

818
00:58:06.951 --> 00:58:09.019
before he ever got
close to the bus stop.

819
00:58:15.392 --> 00:58:17.127
- When I was in Iraq.

820
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:22.700
I was working on an IED outside
of an apartment complex.

821
00:58:25.803 --> 00:58:28.072
We had a new guy on the
team. Marcus Fincher.

822
00:58:31.642 --> 00:58:32.977
Stupid kid.

823
00:58:36.881 --> 00:58:40.885
He was really eager to
go in and save lives and

824
00:58:42.653 --> 00:58:45.489
whatever patriotic
mindset he had.

825
00:58:48.993 --> 00:58:50.494
So I let him put on that suit.

826
00:58:51.862 --> 00:58:54.098
and I let him go over
there and diffuse the bomb.

827
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.268
He did a really
good job at it too.

828
00:59:01.538 --> 00:59:04.775
I saw him pull the
IED out of the dirt.

829
00:59:07.978 --> 00:59:09.346
and that look on his face.

830
00:59:13.651 --> 00:59:15.085
He was so proud.

831
00:59:21.225 --> 00:59:22.159
What he missed...

832
00:59:23.594 --> 00:59:24.895
What I missed...

833
00:59:27.431 --> 00:59:29.834
Was there was second device
14 yards away from him

834
00:59:29.834 --> 00:59:31.268
on the other side of the road.

835
00:59:33.904 --> 00:59:35.172
And then. boom.

836
00:59:37.908 --> 00:59:38.909
It went off.

837
00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:48.152
Rounds started flying. I.

838
00:59:49.353 --> 00:59:51.588
I had to take cover
in the Humvee and...

839
00:59:53.858 --> 00:59:55.125
All I could see was dust.

840
00:59:58.028 --> 00:59:58.963
And my guys...

841
01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:07.037
They couldn't do shit.

842
01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:17.581
Apaches came in and they
cleared out the area.

843
01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:26.323
And when the dust settled. I
stepped outside onto the road.

844
01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:31.662
And I was alone for a minute.

845
01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:35.933
on this Iraqi street.

846
01:00:39.837 --> 01:00:41.405
on the other side of the world.

847
01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:51.281
There was nothing I
could've done differently.

848
01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:56.253
- Shit happens. huh?

849
01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:00.457
- Yeah.

850
01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:02.492
Shit happens.

851
01:01:09.633 --> 01:01:12.602
I'm gonna go check on the other
end and see what I can find.

852
01:01:15.072 --> 01:01:17.207
- Yeah. give me a minute.

853
01:01:31.756 --> 01:01:32.589
Hey. babe?

854
01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:36.026
Thanks for telling
me about that.

855
01:01:38.262 --> 01:01:40.064
I'm sorry that
happened to you. but.

856
01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:44.701
it sounded like they were doing
something they believed in.

857
01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.971
and they were with their
people when it happened.

858
01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:49.106
- Huh?

859
01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.777
Yeah. they were a
good group of guys.

860
01:01:54.311 --> 01:01:55.645
We had some fun times.

861
01:01:58.182 --> 01:02:02.987
- I know it sounds cliche.
but bad things do happen to...

862
01:02:02.987 --> 01:02:03.821
(screams)

863
01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:05.289
- Mark. Mark!

864
01:02:05.289 --> 01:02:06.824
- Let me go! (screams)
- Mark!

865
01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:08.458
(muffled yelling)

866
01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:09.794
- [Man] Shut up!

867
01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:15.732
Heather!

868
01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.001
Heather. doll.

869
01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:18.535
Stay put. okay?

870
01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:20.871
We're just gonna look
around down here.

871
01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:22.172
And speak to your husband.

872
01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:28.979
We'll keep him. uh.
comfortable! (laughs)

873
01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:30.781
- [Mark] (screams) Let me go!

874
01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:32.516
- [Man] Okay. now. stay put.

875
01:02:34.651 --> 01:02:36.420
(Mark screams)

876
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.556
(Heather grunts)

877
01:02:39.556 --> 01:02:41.125
Sweetie!

878
01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:43.727
You're gonna hurt yourself!

879
01:02:43.727 --> 01:02:46.463
(Heather grunts)

880
01:02:55.172 --> 01:02:58.075

looking for. (chuckles)

974
01:12:49.566 --> 01:12:51.835
We're gonna get outta here.

975
01:12:55.805 --> 01:12:57.907
Just one more play.

976
01:12:57.907 --> 01:12:58.908
I got what they want.

977
01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:01.645
- And if they decide to kill us?

- They won't.

979
01:13:05.515 --> 01:13:06.416
- Not gonna lie.

980
01:13:07.784 --> 01:13:09.252
If I didn't think I was
gonna die in the next minute.

981
01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:12.388

(door creaks)

1008
01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:39.603

Yeah. I can do that.

1015
01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.848
I can do that.

1016
01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:57.120

The mayor. and do you
know what the mayor does?

1020
01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:08.497

- Well. I gotta get Mark.

1022
01:16:11.367 --> 01:16:12.201
Okay.

Now look. that's the
key to the city. okay?

1024

naughty things and-

1026
01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:23.012

1027
01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:26.616
- Yeah. okay. okay.

(flesh squelches)
(screams)

1037
01:16:55.779 --> 01:16:58.114

1038
01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:00.717
(Mark groans)

1039
01:17:00.717 --> 01:17:01.550

You don't have to
make it again. okay?

1044
01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:18.134
Hand me the drive.

1045

Hand me the drive!

1047
01:17:24.273 --> 01:17:26.375
You know what? How about
I just shoot him and you?

1048
01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:27.210
(Heather grunts)

1049
01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:28.144
Okay. okay.

1050
01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:31.280

(Heather screams)

1052
01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:35.952

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:55.231
Whoa! (pants)
- Shit. shit.

1067
01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:56.365
- Heather!

1068
01:18:56.365 --> 01:18:58.367
(pants)

1069
01:18:59.502 --> 01:19:01.370
What was that? That
was a nice try!

1070
01:19:02.972 --> 01:19:03.807
Woo!

1071
01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:06.342
This!

1072
01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:10.646
How could you not see?

1073
01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.249
This is gonna make heads turn!

1074
01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:16.052
And you could've
been in on this!

1075
01:19:19.856 --> 01:19:23.526
Well. it's a damn shame
that you couldn't be...

1076
01:19:23.526 --> 01:19:25.228
(gun fires)

1077
01:19:25.228 --> 01:19:27.296
(groans)

1078
01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:32.035
(Heather sobs)

1079
01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:42.045
(watch bleeps)

1080
01:19:53.356 --> 01:19:55.691
(both pant)

1081
01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.363
(Mark grunts)

1082
01:20:00.363 --> 01:20:01.931
- Come on. come on.

1083
01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.142
(pants)

1084
01:20:14.777 --> 01:20:17.180
We have to stop the bleeding.

1085
01:20:18.081 --> 01:20:20.850
(Mark grunts)
Careful.

1086
01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:25.855
Put pressure on it.
(Mark groans)

1087
01:20:28.925 --> 01:20:32.261
(dark electronic music)

1088
01:20:34.097 --> 01:20:34.931
Shit.

1089
01:20:39.635 --> 01:20:42.005
(car starts)

1090
01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:55.751
(engine roars)

1091
01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.862
(somber music)
