00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:33.289
- Karl. I respect your decision to quit

4
00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.518
and follow your passion.

5
00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:36.956
And remember this.

6
00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:38.351
if things don't quite work out

7
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:40.640
and you wanna come back.

8
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.723
this is home.

9
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.854
Now. I know that's not what you wanna hear

10
00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:50.219
but you know sometimes man's
quest to chase his dreams

11
00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.775
is just that.

12
00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:52.608
a quest.

13
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:56.874
And in the meantime. life happens.

14
00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:01.695
(soft music)

15
00:01:47.538 --> 00:01:50.121
(phone chimes)

16
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.694
- Hi. hey.

17
00:02:17.694 --> 00:02:18.894
Hello.

18
00:02:18.894 --> 00:02:19.894
How are ya?

19
00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.167
Have a nice day.

20
00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.549
(intercom rings)

21
00:02:59.973 --> 00:03:00.806
Yo?

22
00:03:01.824 --> 00:03:02.991
Yeah. come up.

23
00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:17.099
(Knocks on the)

24
00:03:21.823 --> 00:03:24.978
- Jesus. don't you wanna open a window?

25
00:03:24.978 --> 00:03:26.600
- I just got in.

26
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.433
- How can you live like this?

27
00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:29.585
It's disgusting.

28
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:31.755
- I didn't have a chance
to put anything away.

29
00:03:31.755 --> 00:03:36.172
- Right. well. we're not
eating until we've cleaned.

30
00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.741
Yeah well. I don't think
I'm gonna see him again.

31
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:48.797
- Well. what for?

32
00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:50.590
You just said you had
a nice time with him.

33
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.341
- I did but when it came to paying

34
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:55.352
he was just
- Oh. God here we go.

35
00:03:55.352 --> 00:03:57.232
- No. seriously I literally just said

36
00:03:57.232 --> 00:03:58.293
I wanted to split the bill. right?

37
00:03:58.293 --> 00:03:59.458
That's it.

38
00:03:59.458 --> 00:04:01.879
He freaked. we had this massive argument.

39
00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.092
It all went tits up from there really so.

40
00:04:04.092 --> 00:04:05.363
- What you mean?

41
00:04:05.363 --> 00:04:07.854
- He wanted to pay for the whole bill.

42
00:04:07.854 --> 00:04:09.331
- That's nice. isn't it?

43
00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:10.974
- No. Yes.

44
00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:11.807
Okay. yes.

45
00:04:11.807 --> 00:04:12.817
Obviously that's a nice thing

46
00:04:12.817 --> 00:04:15.064
but if I insist on splitting

47
00:04:15.064 --> 00:04:17.716
and you just can't accept that.

48
00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.158
I mean there's something else
going on behind that surely.

49
00:04:20.158 --> 00:04:22.179
- (scoffs) Like what?

50
00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:24.004
- Like. I don't know.

51
00:04:25.962 --> 00:04:28.107
Okay. first of all.

52
00:04:28.107 --> 00:04:30.279
is he ever really gonna accept
my independence as a woman?

53
00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:31.112
No.

54
00:04:31.112 --> 00:04:31.986
- What has that got to do

55
00:04:31.986 --> 00:04:33.295
with your independence as a woman?

56
00:04:33.295 --> 00:04:34.848
He was just trying to
buy you a nice dinner.

57
00:04:34.848 --> 00:04:36.515
- Yeah and so did I.

58
00:04:38.304 --> 00:04:39.860
- Yeah see. so you both
wanna do something nice

59
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.693
for each other.

60
00:04:40.693 --> 00:04:41.559
What's wrong with that?

61
00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:42.442
- You don't understand.

62
00:04:42.442 --> 00:04:43.979
- No. I do understand.

63
00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.426
I just think you exaggerated a little bit.

64
00:04:46.426 --> 00:04:47.592
- Get fucked.

65
00:04:47.592 --> 00:04:50.121
I'm not exaggerating. I'm just saying.

66
00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:51.595
Things are changing. Karl. all right?

67
00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:52.428
- No. I can see that.

68
00:04:52.428 --> 00:04:54.094
People are becoming more hostile.

69
00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:55.479
- I'm not hostile to you.

70
00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:56.561
- No. no. no.

71
00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:00.528
When people are trying to
find their possible partner.

72
00:05:00.528 --> 00:05:03.987
- That's just a complete
generalization. isn't it?

73
00:05:03.987 --> 00:05:06.256
- Think about it. there is
some truth within there.

74
00:05:06.256 --> 00:05:08.188
People are definitely
becoming less tolerant

75
00:05:08.188 --> 00:05:09.830
and more judgmental.

76
00:05:11.128 --> 00:05:12.863
- Well. now you're just judging me.

77
00:05:12.863 --> 00:05:14.414
- No. Okay. let's stop this.

78
00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:15.972
- No. why?

79
00:05:15.972 --> 00:05:17.265
- Because you're getting defensive.

80
00:05:17.265 --> 00:05:20.621
- Oh. good one. I am not defensive.

81
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:22.852
- [Karl] You are.

82
00:05:22.852 --> 00:05:25.480
Wait. do you want another one?

83
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.730
- No. thanks I'm all right.

84
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.934
So. how are things with you?

85
00:05:39.395 --> 00:05:40.764
If you don't wanna talk about it--

86
00:05:40.764 --> 00:05:42.347
- No. no it's fine.

87
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.883
- Have you spoken to her or?

88
00:05:46.883 --> 00:05:48.383
- No. why would I?

89
00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:50.058
- Yeah.

90
00:05:53.703 --> 00:05:55.703
Can I ask you something?

91
00:05:57.245 --> 00:06:00.412
Did you really never suspect anything?

92
00:06:04.083 --> 00:06:05.000
- Nah. no.

93
00:06:06.582 --> 00:06:08.665
Honestly. no. not at all.

94
00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:11.170
And it's really annoying

95
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.337
when people say something like that

96
00:06:13.337 --> 00:06:14.754
where they think.

97
00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:18.694
was there anything wrong
in the relationship?

98
00:06:18.694 --> 00:06:19.978
Could you tell it wasn't working?

99
00:06:19.978 --> 00:06:21.487
No. honestly not.

100
00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:23.528
- Yeah.

101
00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:25.933
Yeah. it's bad.

102
00:06:28.102 --> 00:06:31.319
I did see two people
at the same time once.

103
00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:33.819
It was only for like a week.

104
00:06:34.717 --> 00:06:35.699
- Yeah. that's all right.

105
00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:36.694
- Yeah. okay.
- Yeah.

106
00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:38.945
(both laugh)

107
00:06:38.945 --> 00:06:41.373
Do you know what I mean though.

108
00:06:41.373 --> 00:06:43.586
it just scares me having
that knowledge now

109
00:06:43.586 --> 00:06:48.396
of the person that you
trust or the person you like

110
00:06:48.396 --> 00:06:51.273
that they can still keep
things hidden from you.

111
00:06:51.273 --> 00:06:54.055
And you have like no idea

112
00:06:54.055 --> 00:06:56.839
and you can't do anything about it.

113
00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:58.346
- I don't think that's necessarily true.

114
00:06:58.346 --> 00:06:59.687
- Well. I do.

115
00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:02.925
- No. I think it's about
like the people themselves.

116
00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:04.199
You deserved better than her.

117
00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:05.442
- No. don't say that.

118
00:07:05.442 --> 00:07:06.779
- What?

119
00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:07.970
- It's just silly innit.

120
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.061
It's a cliche.

121
00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:10.978
- But it's true though.

122
00:07:13.714 --> 00:07:16.047
Have you met anyone else or?

123
00:07:18.598 --> 00:07:20.616
- I just need a break.

124
00:07:20.616 --> 00:07:23.276
- Might be a good distraction.

125
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.047
- Well. no. I've actually
been keeping distracted

126
00:07:26.047 --> 00:07:28.688
with all this camera equipment.

127
00:07:29.941 --> 00:07:33.343
- What are you gonna do with that?

128
00:07:33.343 --> 00:07:35.180
- It's my dad's old stuff.

129
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.564
Just been playing with it.

130
00:07:37.564 --> 00:07:38.397
- No.

131
00:07:38.397 --> 00:07:39.230
- Mm hmm.

132
00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:42.647
- You want a money shot?

133
00:07:42.647 --> 00:07:44.048
- Yeah. smile.

134
00:07:44.048 --> 00:07:45.172
(camera clicks)

135
00:07:45.172 --> 00:07:46.246
(Karl laughs)

136
00:07:46.246 --> 00:07:47.221
- That's way too early.

137
00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:48.920
I still wasn't ready.
- A mouthful of food.

138
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.753
(camera clicks)

139
00:07:49.753 --> 00:07:50.586
- Fucking hell.

140
00:07:52.618 --> 00:07:53.509
- So rude.

141
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.013
- Oh my God.

142
00:07:59.264 --> 00:08:00.330
- Geez.

143
00:08:35.137 --> 00:08:38.017
- [Frank] Welcome to another
episode of "Be a Photographer".

144
00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.058
My name is Frank

145
00:08:39.058 --> 00:08:40.686
and if you're looking
to step up your game.

146
00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.298
this video is for you.

147
00:08:42.298 --> 00:08:43.200
After you have mastered
(camera clicks)

148
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.636
the way your camera works.

149
00:08:44.636 --> 00:08:46.015
how to frame a picture.

150
00:08:46.015 --> 00:08:47.542
how to expose it properly.

151
00:08:47.542 --> 00:08:50.881
you might find yourself lost
in choosing what to photograph.

152
00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:52.370
Are you a portrait photographer?

153
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.236
Do you like nature.
architecture. landscape?

154
00:08:55.236 --> 00:08:58.531
Sooner or later. if you
want to make an impact

155
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:00.098
you will have to make a choice.

156
00:09:00.098 --> 00:09:01.474
Trust me. it's not easy.

157
00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:03.141
You will find yourself shifting towards

158
00:09:03.141 --> 00:09:04.758
what's grabbing your attention

159
00:09:04.758 --> 00:09:07.415
and that won't have a
link when seen together.

160
00:09:07.415 --> 00:09:08.983
Even if you want to be an artist.

161
00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:10.373
you have to look inside yourself

162
00:09:10.373 --> 00:09:11.989
and understand what drives you.

163
00:09:11.989 --> 00:09:12.822
what motivates you.

164
00:09:12.822 --> 00:09:14.991
What is the message that
you're trying to convey--

165
00:10:30.706 --> 00:10:33.623
(slow tense music)

166
00:11:39.413 --> 00:11:43.088
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

167
00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:26.946
(camera clicks)

168
00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:38.709
(tense music)

169
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.630
(camera clicking)
(tense music)

170
00:13:51.382 --> 00:13:54.215
(soft jazz music)

171
00:14:02.964 --> 00:14:04.104
- [Virginia] Hello?

172
00:14:04.104 --> 00:14:04.946
- Hi. come in.

173
00:14:04.946 --> 00:14:06.022
Sorry I'm just cooking.

174
00:14:06.022 --> 00:14:07.755
- Hmm. I can smell that.

175
00:14:07.755 --> 00:14:09.156
Don't you wanna open a window?

176
00:14:09.156 --> 00:14:09.989
- No I just got--

177
00:14:09.989 --> 00:14:12.171
- Whoa. this amazing.

178
00:14:12.171 --> 00:14:13.643
Did you get a cleaner in?

179
00:14:13.643 --> 00:14:14.485
- Nope.

180
00:14:14.485 --> 00:14:15.850
- Ah. don't believe that.

181
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.427
- You better.

182
00:14:17.427 --> 00:14:18.404
- What are you making?

183
00:14:18.404 --> 00:14:19.237
- Just some veg.

184
00:14:19.237 --> 00:14:21.687
We got some courgettes
and some onions and rice.

185
00:14:21.687 --> 00:14:23.741
- Mmhmm. very nice. very nice.

186
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:24.615
- Very tasty.

187
00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:26.619
- We need to celebrate.

188
00:14:26.619 --> 00:14:28.036
- Oh. absolutely.

189
00:14:30.318 --> 00:14:31.463
(chuckles) I'm kidding.

190
00:14:31.463 --> 00:14:32.761
Wait. please tell me?

191
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:33.780
How did it go?

192
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.613
Start to finish.

193
00:14:34.613 --> 00:14:36.658
- Yeah. actually it went
really. really well.

194
00:14:36.658 --> 00:14:38.937
And we really got each
other in the interview

195
00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:40.464
and I kind of knew then. you know?

196
00:14:40.464 --> 00:14:41.678
- Did she tell you that in there?

197
00:14:41.678 --> 00:14:42.511
- No. no.

198
00:14:42.511 --> 00:14:43.393
They called me two hours later

199
00:14:43.393 --> 00:14:44.827
but like I kind of knew.

200
00:14:44.827 --> 00:14:45.741
you know when you get that feeling?

201
00:14:45.741 --> 00:14:46.574
- Mm hmm.

202
00:14:46.574 --> 00:14:48.227
- And we were talking so
much in the interviews.

203
00:14:48.227 --> 00:14:49.060
It was really nice.

204
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.893
- That's nice.

205
00:14:49.893 --> 00:14:51.535
Oh wait. when do you start working?

206
00:14:51.535 --> 00:14:52.735
- A week's time.

207
00:14:52.735 --> 00:14:53.568
- Week?

208
00:14:53.568 --> 00:14:54.401
- I can't wait. I love it.

209
00:14:54.401 --> 00:14:57.444
It's all women in the team. so perfect.

210
00:14:57.444 --> 00:14:59.535
- That's nice and equal. yeah.

211
00:14:59.535 --> 00:15:00.426
- Oh. I'm sorry.

212
00:15:00.426 --> 00:15:01.841
Do you wanna go through the statistics?

213
00:15:01.841 --> 00:15:03.611
No. no. no. no. no. no.
- Because we can.

214
00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.454
- No. no I was just teasing.

215
00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:06.287
- Okay.

216
00:15:06.287 --> 00:15:07.429
Okay. what would the role be.

217
00:15:07.429 --> 00:15:09.031
that you went for?

218
00:15:09.031 --> 00:15:10.364
- I'm not really sure.

219
00:15:10.364 --> 00:15:12.862
I guess I'm just gonna
be like following cases.

220
00:15:12.862 --> 00:15:15.366
like learning from
senior lawyers. you know?

221
00:15:15.366 --> 00:15:17.837
I'm starting from the bottom. so.

222
00:15:17.837 --> 00:15:20.485
- Weird 'cause you prefer
being on top. don't you?

223
00:15:20.485 --> 00:15:21.837
- You're such a...

224
00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:23.454
It wasn't even funny.

225
00:15:23.454 --> 00:15:24.805
- Oh sorry. I'm just kidding.

226
00:15:24.805 --> 00:15:25.638
But think about it though.

227
00:15:25.638 --> 00:15:28.705
You're now in like a. I don't know

228
00:15:28.705 --> 00:15:33.206
a great environment. the
best you could be in.

229
00:15:33.206 --> 00:15:34.647
- Yeah. exactly.

230
00:15:37.163 --> 00:15:39.246
To the right environment.

231
00:15:50.303 --> 00:15:53.261
So speaking of environments.

232
00:15:53.261 --> 00:15:56.126
what made you clean this place up?

233
00:15:56.126 --> 00:15:57.594
- Well. a friend of mine told me

234
00:15:57.594 --> 00:15:59.128
that it looked like a shithole.

235
00:15:59.128 --> 00:16:00.818
So I had to do something about it.

236
00:16:00.818 --> 00:16:03.251
- Yeah. well that friend
was absolutely right.

237
00:16:03.251 --> 00:16:04.960
- Yeah. she was.

238
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.208
It's a combination of things.

239
00:16:06.208 --> 00:16:07.258
- Like what?

240
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.348
- Well I started taking more pictures.

241
00:16:10.348 --> 00:16:11.608
- Oh. with your dad's camera?

242
00:16:11.608 --> 00:16:12.986
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

243
00:16:12.986 --> 00:16:14.300
I used to have such a passion for it

244
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.383
but I just...

245
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:19.114
I neglected it the last few years.

246
00:16:20.038 --> 00:16:21.425
- I didn't know.

247
00:16:21.425 --> 00:16:22.543
Can I see some of the pictures?

248
00:16:22.543 --> 00:16:23.668
- Wait. what?

249
00:16:24.612 --> 00:16:27.424
- Can I see some of the photos?

250
00:16:27.424 --> 00:16:31.467
- (chuckles) Well. no I haven't
done any work on them yet.

251
00:16:31.467 --> 00:16:34.187
- I don't care. just let me
see some of the raw files.

252
00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:38.304
- No. why don't you just
wait till they're done?

253
00:16:38.304 --> 00:16:40.338
- Ooh. mysterious.

254
00:16:42.038 --> 00:16:42.871
- It's not even that.

255
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:43.854
I've just been exploring.

256
00:16:43.854 --> 00:16:47.271
I've been just taking just random photos.

257
00:16:48.265 --> 00:16:49.699
- All right.

258
00:16:49.699 --> 00:16:52.175
Well. it definitely got me curious.

259
00:16:52.175 --> 00:16:53.968
- Well. it's nothing exciting.

260
00:16:53.968 --> 00:16:55.952
I can promise you that.

261
00:17:38.304 --> 00:17:41.221
(soft tense music)

262
00:17:47.724 --> 00:17:50.153
(camera clicks)

263
00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:53.540
(soft tense music)

264
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.373
(camera clicking)

265
00:18:22.175 --> 00:18:24.675
(dog barking)

266
00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:35.313
Oh shit.

267
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.933
(knocks on the door)

268
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.588
- Hey. sorry I left my phone.

269
00:18:53.588 --> 00:18:54.421
- Oh. did you?

270
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:56.000
- Yeah. it's just in the bathroom.

271
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.659
- I didn't hear it.

272
00:18:57.659 --> 00:18:58.967
- It's dead. That's why. no worries.

273
00:18:58.967 --> 00:18:59.800
Thanks.

274
00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.641
- No worries.

275
00:19:00.641 --> 00:19:01.566
- You all right?

276
00:19:01.566 --> 00:19:02.721
- Yeah. I'm fine.

277
00:19:02.721 --> 00:19:03.554
- Are you sure?

278
00:19:03.554 --> 00:19:04.709
You look really pale.

279
00:19:04.709 --> 00:19:06.169
- Honestly. I'm absolutely
fine. Thank you.

280
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:09.255
- You're not meant to be at work?

281
00:19:09.255 --> 00:19:12.422
- Well. I don't have that job anymore.

282
00:19:13.474 --> 00:19:15.689
- Oh. since when?

283
00:19:15.689 --> 00:19:16.522
- Week.

284
00:19:17.875 --> 00:19:19.061
- Is everything all right?
Do you wanna talk about it?

285
00:19:19.061 --> 00:19:20.402
I've got half hour.

286
00:19:22.824 --> 00:19:23.972
- Well. I've gotta you something. V

287
00:19:23.972 --> 00:19:27.559
but if I show you. you promise
me you won't freak out. yeah?

288
00:19:27.559 --> 00:19:28.392
- All right.

289
00:19:28.392 --> 00:19:29.475
- Come on in.

290
00:19:36.154 --> 00:19:37.206
(Karl sighs)

291
00:19:37.206 --> 00:19:38.673
- This is so bad.

292
00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:43.082
- Do you think I'm gonna
get in trouble for it?

293
00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:43.915
- I mean. I hope not

294
00:19:43.915 --> 00:19:45.829
but it's definitely a
violation of privacy.

295
00:19:45.829 --> 00:19:47.227
- Is it?

296
00:19:47.227 --> 00:19:48.990
- Yes. what did you have in mind?

297
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.823
- I don't know.

298
00:19:49.823 --> 00:19:51.439
I just felt like taking the pictures.

299
00:19:51.439 --> 00:19:53.263
- You felt like taking the pictures?

300
00:19:53.263 --> 00:19:55.062
What. and if you're hungry
you walk into a supermarket

301
00:19:55.062 --> 00:19:56.319
and steal a banana. do you?

302
00:19:56.319 --> 00:19:57.192
What?

303
00:19:57.192 --> 00:19:58.775
- No. I just...

304
00:20:00.737 --> 00:20:02.908
I didn't think it would
be a problem. you know?

305
00:20:02.908 --> 00:20:04.330
- Are these the pictures
you've been working on?

306
00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:05.441
Is that why you didn't wanna tell me?

307
00:20:05.441 --> 00:20:06.274
- No. no.

308
00:20:07.939 --> 00:20:08.772
Yeah. they were.

309
00:20:08.772 --> 00:20:10.058
But it's just because I didn't know

310
00:20:10.058 --> 00:20:11.892
what was gonna come from them or...

311
00:20:11.892 --> 00:20:12.958
If I don't use them.

312
00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:14.750
it's not going to be a problem. okay?

313
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:15.625
- I mean. I don't know.

314
00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:17.223
What if she comes after you?

315
00:20:17.223 --> 00:20:18.559
- Can she?

316
00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:19.737
- I would if I was her.

317
00:20:19.737 --> 00:20:21.519
- V. that doesn't help at all.

318
00:20:21.519 --> 00:20:22.578
- You men are unbelievable.

319
00:20:22.578 --> 00:20:24.657
You just think with your dick.

320
00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:26.306
- See. that's the issue.

321
00:20:26.306 --> 00:20:28.215
It wasn't a sexual thing for me.

322
00:20:28.215 --> 00:20:29.693
- Oh. come on.

323
00:20:29.693 --> 00:20:30.526
- I swear.

324
00:20:30.526 --> 00:20:31.599
Look. I just thought the situation

325
00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:33.621
was really. really interesting.

326
00:20:33.621 --> 00:20:35.038
- How do you think she feels now?

327
00:20:35.038 --> 00:20:37.763
She doesn't even feel
safe in her own room.

328
00:20:37.763 --> 00:20:40.132
- Yeah but I meant no harm by it.

329
00:20:40.132 --> 00:20:42.673
- She doesn't know that. does she?

330
00:20:44.704 --> 00:20:46.611
Anyway I've gotta go.

331
00:20:46.611 --> 00:20:49.416
- Wait. what am I gonna do?

332
00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:51.546
- Just stop taking pictures of her.

333
00:20:51.546 --> 00:20:53.681
Delete the ones you already have.

334
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:54.518
- Really?

335
00:20:54.518 --> 00:20:55.435
- Yes Karl.

336
00:20:56.499 --> 00:20:58.482
And go look for a job.

337
00:21:04.007 --> 00:21:06.924
(soft tense music)

338
00:21:23.754 --> 00:21:26.754
(keyboard clicking)

339
00:22:11.197 --> 00:22:12.164
- Yeah. I saw her.

340
00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:12.997
She saw me.

341
00:22:12.997 --> 00:22:15.011
She saw my camera.

342
00:22:15.011 --> 00:22:18.244
Yeah. I just don't want
her to think I'm a freak.

343
00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:21.392
Yeah.

344
00:22:22.725 --> 00:22:24.142
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

345
00:22:28.183 --> 00:22:29.766
Bye. bye. bye. bye.

346
00:22:43.707 --> 00:22:46.207
(tense music)

347
00:22:52.417 --> 00:22:55.750
(footsteps approaching)

348
00:24:49.476 --> 00:24:51.869
- Can't believe she
actually knows who you are.

349
00:24:51.869 --> 00:24:53.369
- See. I told you.

350
00:24:54.274 --> 00:24:55.761
- Maybe she's just another perv

351
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:58.240
trying to get a look at what you see.

352
00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.682
- What? Seriously?

353
00:25:01.762 --> 00:25:04.258
- Have you already
showed her the pictures?

354
00:25:04.258 --> 00:25:05.091
- Well.

355
00:25:05.091 --> 00:25:06.309
- Oh god. you're such an idiot.

356
00:25:06.309 --> 00:25:07.544
- Why. what's the issue there?

357
00:25:07.544 --> 00:25:09.347
- What did she say to you?

358
00:25:09.347 --> 00:25:11.540
- She hasn't said anything yet.

359
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:12.713
- You've just given her the proof

360
00:25:12.713 --> 00:25:14.375
of the fact that you took those photos.

361
00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:15.208
- The proof?

362
00:25:15.208 --> 00:25:16.179
She's already seen me.

363
00:25:16.179 --> 00:25:17.170
I mean. that's proof enough

364
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.700
and besides I researched online.

365
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.702
if I don't publish her
pictures without her permission

366
00:25:21.702 --> 00:25:23.818
then I'm not gonna be breaking any laws.

367
00:25:23.818 --> 00:25:25.221
And on the other side.

368
00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:26.873
I'm hoping that I'll catch her

369
00:25:26.873 --> 00:25:28.171
and be able to have a
conversation with her

370
00:25:28.171 --> 00:25:29.502
and ask if I can use her pictures.

371
00:25:29.502 --> 00:25:31.571
- Use them for what?

372
00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:35.413
Well. I was actually down at
the art gallery the other day

373
00:25:35.413 --> 00:25:37.472
and they're holding a new
talent showcases this month.

374
00:25:37.472 --> 00:25:38.657
- And what is that?

375
00:25:38.657 --> 00:25:40.143
- Well I need to pitch them an idea

376
00:25:40.143 --> 00:25:41.090
and if they like my idea

377
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.897
then they're gonna showcase my work.

378
00:25:42.897 --> 00:25:44.444
It's hard. I don't really
know what to do on it just yet

379
00:25:44.444 --> 00:25:47.679
but I do feel like it
needs to have a theme.

380
00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:49.978
It needs to tell a story of some sort.

381
00:25:49.978 --> 00:25:50.983
- All right.

382
00:25:50.983 --> 00:25:52.816
What are you thinking?

383
00:25:53.701 --> 00:25:55.489
- It needs to feel...

384
00:25:55.489 --> 00:25:57.555
It needs to be based around
something that's happening now.

385
00:25:57.555 --> 00:25:59.041
You know. like current.

386
00:25:59.041 --> 00:26:01.598
It needs to feel authentic. you know?

387
00:26:01.598 --> 00:26:06.015
- So all of this has just
been about this exhibition?

388
00:26:06.892 --> 00:26:08.904
- Yeah about a project.

389
00:26:08.904 --> 00:26:11.556
- What? Naked women and art.

390
00:26:11.556 --> 00:26:13.008
I mean. that has been done before.

391
00:26:13.008 --> 00:26:13.986
It's a bit cliche.

392
00:26:13.986 --> 00:26:14.977
- No. no. no.

393
00:26:14.977 --> 00:26:15.820
It's the situation now.

394
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.764
The nudity isn't what interests me.

395
00:26:17.764 --> 00:26:19.504
- What situation?

396
00:26:19.504 --> 00:26:21.282
- This whole situation. you know?

397
00:26:21.282 --> 00:26:22.246
- No. I don't know.

398
00:26:22.246 --> 00:26:23.756
What situation?

399
00:26:23.756 --> 00:26:24.687
- Well. the privacy issue

400
00:26:24.687 --> 00:26:27.741
that we're all dealing with this days.

401
00:26:27.741 --> 00:26:29.287
- Karl. you just like her.

402
00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:30.420
Will you just admit it?

403
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.620
- What?

404
00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:32.883
- Yeah. she's a beautiful woman.

405
00:26:32.883 --> 00:26:34.854
You're taking loads of
pictures of her every day.

406
00:26:34.854 --> 00:26:36.354
Why would you not?

407
00:26:37.611 --> 00:26:39.162
- Okay. well. if I'm honest

408
00:26:39.162 --> 00:26:40.643
I actually haven't even
thought about that.

409
00:26:40.643 --> 00:26:41.496
- Oh come on.

410
00:26:41.496 --> 00:26:42.568
Yes. you have.

411
00:26:42.568 --> 00:26:43.505
- I haven't. I swear.

412
00:26:43.505 --> 00:26:45.748
Why does it always gotta be about sex?

413
00:26:45.748 --> 00:26:46.915
- You tell me.

414
00:26:50.526 --> 00:26:52.379
All right. I've gotta go.

415
00:26:52.379 --> 00:26:53.425
It's getting late.

416
00:26:53.425 --> 00:26:55.149
Let's just see what she says.

417
00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:56.594
- Okay. Thank you.

418
00:26:56.594 --> 00:26:58.364
Actually no. thank you seriously

419
00:26:58.364 --> 00:27:01.114
for putting up with my craziness.

420
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.249
- Well. at least you're aware of it.

421
00:27:05.249 --> 00:27:06.082
Weirdo.

422
00:27:07.705 --> 00:27:09.805
- Thank you. see you later.

423
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.997
(soft tense music)

424
00:27:22.284 --> 00:27:27.234

425
00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.906

(camera clicking)

436
00:29:30.489 --> 00:29:31.625
- [Virginia speaking on
phone] Is everything okay?

437
00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:33.163
- You have to see these new pictures.

438
00:29:33.163 --> 00:29:34.129
- [Virginia speaking on
phone] What do you mean

439
00:29:34.129 --> 00:29:35.273
new pictures?

440
00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:36.964
- She's posing for them.

441
00:29:36.964 --> 00:29:38.613
like she's okay with me taking them.

442
00:29:38.613 --> 00:29:39.693
- [Virginia speaking on phone] What?

443
00:29:39.693 --> 00:29:40.891
Did you speak to her?

444
00:29:40.891 --> 00:29:41.724
- No. no. no

445
00:29:41.724 --> 00:29:44.140
but she was clearly asking for more.

446
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.762
- [Virginia speaking on phone]
Karl. that's a backward thing

447
00:29:45.762 --> 00:29:47.637
to say for god's sake.

448
00:29:47.637 --> 00:29:50.003
- Can you stop that? Why--

449
00:29:50.003 --> 00:29:50.836
- [Virginia speaking
on phone] Well. tell me

450
00:29:50.836 --> 00:29:51.698
what happened then?

451
00:29:51.698 --> 00:29:52.531
- Okay. I'll explain it

452
00:29:52.531 --> 00:29:53.364
but you gotta come around here.

453
00:29:53.364 --> 00:29:55.214
you need to see these.

454
00:29:55.214 --> 00:29:56.047
- [Virginia speaking on phone] Sorry.

455
00:29:56.047 --> 00:29:57.451
I can't make it tonight.

456
00:29:57.451 --> 00:30:00.859
Why don't you come over here for once?

457
00:30:00.859 --> 00:30:04.724
- Well. 'cause I have to work on them.

458
00:30:04.724 --> 00:30:06.159
- [Virginia speaking on phone] Oh well

459
00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:08.412
then we'll have to do it another time.

460
00:30:08.412 --> 00:30:09.245
Sorry.

461
00:30:09.245 --> 00:30:10.078
- Okay.

462
00:30:11.948 --> 00:30:15.469
- [Virginia speaking on
phone] Speak to you later?

463
00:30:15.469 --> 00:30:16.850
- All right. later.

464
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.267
(soft music)

465
00:31:11.343 --> 00:31:12.176
- Can I ask you something?

466
00:31:12.176 --> 00:31:13.595
- Mm hmm.

467
00:31:13.595 --> 00:31:16.699
- Why are you so desperate
to do this exhibition?

468
00:31:16.699 --> 00:31:18.532
- What do you mean?

469
00:31:18.532 --> 00:31:19.365
- I don't know.

470
00:31:19.365 --> 00:31:21.959
I mean. not every photographer
wants to do an exhibition

471
00:31:21.959 --> 00:31:24.709
especially not this early in their career.

472
00:31:24.709 --> 00:31:25.722
- True. Okay.

473
00:31:25.722 --> 00:31:28.328
Well for me. it's all
about consumption. right?

474
00:31:28.328 --> 00:31:29.528
So how you might look at something

475
00:31:29.528 --> 00:31:32.414
gives you a completely
different perspective on it.

476
00:31:32.414 --> 00:31:33.708
We're living in a time now as well

477
00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:35.710
where everything is
consumed far too quickly.

478
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:39.552
So a place like a gallery
or a cinema for movies

479
00:31:39.552 --> 00:31:40.552
for example.

480
00:31:41.626 --> 00:31:43.773
it creates a completely
different experience

481
00:31:43.773 --> 00:31:47.611
compared to Instagram
or Netflix. you know?

482
00:31:47.611 --> 00:31:52.215
- So you're saying the
environment changes the consumer.

483
00:31:52.215 --> 00:31:54.492
- Yeah. yeah. yeah exactly. yeah.

484
00:31:54.492 --> 00:31:56.419
- It's interesting.

485
00:31:56.419 --> 00:32:00.405
But I'm still failing to see
how you're gonna turn that

486
00:32:00.405 --> 00:32:01.696
into an exhibition.

487
00:32:01.696 --> 00:32:03.379
I mean. first of all.
what you're gonna call it?

488
00:32:03.379 --> 00:32:04.379
The stalker?

489
00:32:05.802 --> 00:32:07.541
- Maybe. why not?

490
00:32:07.541 --> 00:32:09.038
- Would you really want
to be seen like that?

491
00:32:09.038 --> 00:32:09.871
- No. that's quite cool.

492
00:32:09.871 --> 00:32:12.063
It could be like the st--

493
00:32:12.063 --> 00:32:14.413
the stalker and the exhibitionist.

494
00:32:14.413 --> 00:32:15.524
- (scoffs) You're insane.

495
00:32:15.524 --> 00:32:16.713
- No. no. I think that's really cool.

496
00:32:16.713 --> 00:32:18.280
I think that highlights
the lack of privacy

497
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.578
we have these days.

498
00:32:19.578 --> 00:32:22.824
as well as the growth of the
narcissistic personalities.

499
00:32:22.824 --> 00:32:24.172
I think that's really cool.

500
00:32:24.172 --> 00:32:26.357
- You're gonna end up
dating her. I know it.

501
00:32:26.357 --> 00:32:27.976
- Nah. she's not my type.

502
00:32:27.976 --> 00:32:30.156
I'm not even looking at the minute either.

503
00:32:30.156 --> 00:32:31.042
- It's a shame.

504
00:32:31.042 --> 00:32:32.875
She might be into you.

505
00:32:35.338 --> 00:32:39.048
- Listen. what's happening with you?

506
00:32:39.048 --> 00:32:44.048
- I am bored of men only
wanting to get into bed with me

507
00:32:44.498 --> 00:32:47.259
or whoever it is they're pursuing.

508
00:32:47.259 --> 00:32:48.092
That's me.

509
00:32:51.005 --> 00:32:52.207
- You're a beautiful girl.

510
00:32:52.207 --> 00:32:53.040
I think it's only normal

511
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.373
for them to wanna have
sex with you. right?

512
00:32:55.373 --> 00:32:56.893
- What are you saying?

513
00:32:56.893 --> 00:32:59.149
- Well. that I understand them.

514
00:32:59.149 --> 00:33:00.856
- So you think I'm only good for sex?

515
00:33:00.856 --> 00:33:02.167
- Nah. fuck. I didn't say that.

516
00:33:02.167 --> 00:33:03.383
- But you just said it's okay

517
00:33:03.383 --> 00:33:05.496
if men only wanna have sex with me.

518
00:33:05.496 --> 00:33:06.329
- No. no. no.

519
00:33:06.329 --> 00:33:07.786
What I mean is.

520
00:33:07.786 --> 00:33:09.159
I mean. if I was to meet
you for the first time.

521
00:33:09.159 --> 00:33:11.717
I would definitely struggle in
thinking about anything else

522
00:33:11.717 --> 00:33:12.883
other than having sex with you.

523
00:33:12.883 --> 00:33:14.537
Not saying that I wouldn't
enjoy your company

524
00:33:14.537 --> 00:33:17.537
or find you intellectually pleasing.

525
00:33:18.671 --> 00:33:20.679
V. you're hot. okay?

526
00:33:20.679 --> 00:33:21.674
It's okay.

527
00:33:21.674 --> 00:33:23.025
- I don't wanna be hot.

528
00:33:23.025 --> 00:33:23.960
I hate that word.

529
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.910
What does it even mean?

530
00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:26.197
- Oh please.

531
00:33:26.197 --> 00:33:27.346
- No. you don't understand.

532
00:33:27.346 --> 00:33:30.158
It makes someone so much
less than they actually are.

533
00:33:30.158 --> 00:33:33.734
I'm so bored of being
sexualized all the time.

534
00:33:33.734 --> 00:33:34.996
I just wanna be seen as a human being.

535
00:33:34.996 --> 00:33:37.838
be able to talk to people.

536
00:33:37.838 --> 00:33:40.198
- I just think you
exaggerate a little bit.

537
00:33:40.198 --> 00:33:41.715
- You're just never gonna understand.

538
00:33:41.715 --> 00:33:42.548
- No. no.

539
00:33:42.548 --> 00:33:43.381
I completely understand.

540
00:33:43.381 --> 00:33:44.675
Honestly. I completely do.

541
00:33:44.675 --> 00:33:45.987
I actually think it must be harder

542
00:33:45.987 --> 00:33:50.158
for a girl who's say.
not so pretty. you know?

543
00:33:50.158 --> 00:33:51.590
To be seen as sexually attractive

544
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.300
than a girl who's hot and smart

545
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.027
to prove their intellect.

546
00:33:55.027 --> 00:33:56.945
Yeah. I really think it's sad

547
00:33:56.945 --> 00:33:58.816
seeing girls de-feminize themselves

548
00:33:58.816 --> 00:34:01.758
so that they can be taken seriously.

549
00:34:01.758 --> 00:34:03.573
I think it's possible to be able

550
00:34:03.573 --> 00:34:04.839
to meet a beautiful girl out there

551
00:34:04.839 --> 00:34:08.241
who's both intellectually
stimulating and sexually pleasing.

552
00:34:08.241 --> 00:34:10.043
- Karl. that's just so unfair.

553
00:34:10.043 --> 00:34:11.782
Why do I have to prove myself?

554
00:34:11.782 --> 00:34:14.085
Why do I have to prove my intellect?

555
00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:15.863
Men don't have to do that. do they?

556
00:34:15.863 --> 00:34:17.507
Why can I not just be myself?

557
00:34:17.507 --> 00:34:19.099
- Wait but who said that?

558
00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:22.685
You have to be yourself.
that's the whole point.

559
00:34:22.685 --> 00:34:23.752
You know I don't think men and women

560
00:34:23.752 --> 00:34:25.101
will ever truly understand each other.

561
00:34:25.101 --> 00:34:28.558
especially as we keep treating
each other as the same being

562
00:34:28.558 --> 00:34:30.775
because we're not the same being.

563
00:34:30.775 --> 00:34:32.096
I mean. we work completely differently

564
00:34:32.096 --> 00:34:34.462
and we need to acknowledge that

565
00:34:34.462 --> 00:34:36.951
and we do need to treat each other equally

566
00:34:36.951 --> 00:34:40.090
but we are not the same being.

567
00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.927
- Yeah. well I don't even know anymore.

568
00:34:42.927 --> 00:34:45.510
I think I'm just done with men.

569
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:51.581
- Have you tried women?

570
00:34:51.581 --> 00:34:52.701
- No. maybe I should.

571
00:34:52.701 --> 00:34:55.368
That might solve a few problems.

572
00:34:57.054 --> 00:35:00.529
See. this is the kind of
conversation I wanna be having.

573
00:35:00.529 --> 00:35:01.711
- What. arguing?

574
00:35:01.711 --> 00:35:02.773
- We're not arguing.

575
00:35:02.773 --> 00:35:04.202
We're just discussing something.

576
00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:05.957
putting forward different ideas. you know?

577
00:35:05.957 --> 00:35:06.790
It's interesting.

578
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:07.876
It's nice.

579
00:35:07.876 --> 00:35:09.793
- No. I know. I was joking.

580
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.750
(dramatic music)

581
00:35:52.847 --> 00:35:54.514
Hi. my name is Karl.

582
00:35:56.188 --> 00:35:57.105
I'm. I'm...

583
00:35:58.694 --> 00:35:59.527
No.

584
00:36:07.856 --> 00:36:08.689
Okay.

585
00:36:10.725 --> 00:36:11.558
Hi. I'm Karl.

586
00:36:11.558 --> 00:36:13.500
I'm an artist.

587
00:36:15.584 --> 00:36:18.417
(paper crackling)

588
00:36:31.295 --> 00:36:35.449
Hi. my name is Karl
and I'm a photographer.

589
00:36:35.449 --> 00:36:38.300
I want to just clarify
that I have no intention

590
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.038
of using the pictures
without your permission

591
00:36:41.038 --> 00:36:44.622
but since I'm working
on my first exhibition.

592
00:36:44.622 --> 00:36:46.610
it would be an honor for
me to have your permission

593
00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:49.280
to print and frame a set of eight pictures

594
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.191
from the ones I took.

595
00:36:51.191 --> 00:36:53.006
I believe whatever the short interaction

596
00:36:53.006 --> 00:36:54.575
between us has been.

597
00:36:54.575 --> 00:36:57.525
it has an artistic value
and would raise questions

598
00:36:57.525 --> 00:37:00.306
about privacy and communication.

599
00:37:00.306 --> 00:37:03.381
Let me know if you are happy
to discuss this further.

600
00:37:03.381 --> 00:37:07.647
You can reach me at Karl.oaks@mail.com.

601
00:37:07.647 --> 00:37:10.023
My best. Karl.

602
00:37:19.037 --> 00:37:21.954
(soft tense music)

603
00:37:31.918 --> 00:37:32.751
- [Virginia speaking on
phone] Hey. I'm at work.

604
00:37:32.751 --> 00:37:33.584
What's up?

605
00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:34.417
- Oh yes.

606
00:37:34.417 --> 00:37:35.250
Sorry. Okay.

607
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.083
Yeah. I'll be quick.

608
00:37:36.083 --> 00:37:40.091
I just wondered if you're free tonight.

609
00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:41.507
- [Virginia speaking on phone] Tonight?

610
00:37:41.507 --> 00:37:42.992
I think I'm gonna end up working late.

611
00:37:42.992 --> 00:37:43.995
Why?

612
00:37:43.995 --> 00:37:45.533
- Okay. what about tomorrow night?

613
00:37:45.533 --> 00:37:46.966
- [Virginia speaking on phone] Tomorrow...

614
00:37:46.966 --> 00:37:47.900
I have a date.

615
00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.842
Sorry. I mean. I can
cancel if it's important.

616
00:37:49.842 --> 00:37:51.075
- Oh no. no. no. Don't worry.

617
00:37:51.075 --> 00:37:51.908
No don't worry about it.

618
00:37:51.908 --> 00:37:53.233
- [Virginia speaking
on phone] Are you sure?

619
00:37:53.233 --> 00:37:54.881
Is everything okay?

620
00:37:54.881 --> 00:37:56.361
You can tell me anything right?

621
00:37:56.361 --> 00:37:57.211
- Mm hmm.

622
00:37:57.211 --> 00:37:59.437
No. I just wanted to know
if you wanted to come

623
00:37:59.437 --> 00:38:01.053
for dinner with me.

624
00:38:01.053 --> 00:38:02.194
- [Virginia speaking on phone]
Well. I mean. we can do that

625
00:38:02.194 --> 00:38:03.643
another time.

626
00:38:03.643 --> 00:38:06.114
Or maybe I can pass by
after if it doesn't go well.

627
00:38:06.114 --> 00:38:07.185
- No. okay.

628
00:38:07.185 --> 00:38:08.018
- [Virginia speaking
on phone] (indistinct)

629
00:38:08.018 --> 00:38:09.129
just need to get back inside.

630
00:38:09.129 --> 00:38:09.962
- Yeah. sure.

631
00:38:09.962 --> 00:38:11.322
Okay. maybe I'll see you later.

632
00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:12.313
- [Virginia speaking on phone] Sorry.

633
00:38:12.313 --> 00:38:13.146
Later.

634
00:38:13.146 --> 00:38:13.979
- Yep.

635
00:38:13.979 --> 00:38:14.812
All right. Bye. bye.

636
00:38:14.812 --> 00:38:15.645
Bye. bye.

637
00:38:36.775 --> 00:38:39.358
(phone chimes)

638
00:39:01.218 --> 00:39:03.218
(sighs)

639
00:39:19.257 --> 00:39:22.257
(dial tone beeping)

640
00:39:27.337 --> 00:39:28.625
- [Virginia speaking on phone] Hello?

641
00:39:28.625 --> 00:39:29.458
- Hi.

642
00:39:29.458 --> 00:39:31.335
Sorry have I called you at a bad time?

643
00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:32.376
- [Virginia speaking on
phone] No. I just got home.

644
00:39:32.376 --> 00:39:33.302
You okay?

645
00:39:33.302 --> 00:39:36.056
- Yeah. yeah.

646
00:39:36.056 --> 00:39:37.836
Listen. what?

647
00:39:37.836 --> 00:39:39.471
I was thinking.

648
00:39:39.471 --> 00:39:41.522
why don't you come out
with me tomorrow night?

649
00:39:41.522 --> 00:39:42.355
- [Virginia speaking on phone] I told you

650
00:39:42.355 --> 00:39:43.825
I've already got a dinner.

651
00:39:43.825 --> 00:39:44.658
What's wrong?

652
00:39:44.658 --> 00:39:45.491
You sound weird.

653
00:39:45.491 --> 00:39:48.082
- No. I just. you know...

654
00:39:48.082 --> 00:39:50.530
We could go to dinner.

655
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:52.067
That's all.

656
00:39:52.067 --> 00:39:52.900
- [Virginia speaking on
phone] Can't we do that

657
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.733
another time?

658
00:39:53.733 --> 00:39:55.233
- Yeah. of course.

659
00:39:56.369 --> 00:39:57.502
But. umh--

660
00:39:59.961 --> 00:40:01.725
Now why don't you...

661
00:40:01.725 --> 00:40:02.558
why don't you cancel it

662
00:40:02.558 --> 00:40:06.020
with this other guy and then
come and meet me instead?

663
00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:09.692
- [Virginia speaking on phone]
Karl. are you asking me out?

664
00:40:09.692 --> 00:40:12.560
- I'm asking you if you'd
like to leave the house.

665
00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:17.560
If you'd like to sit down
and eat some food with me.

666
00:40:18.341 --> 00:40:19.350
- [Virginia speaking on phone] Yeah.

667
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.126
But what I'm trying to understand is.

668
00:40:21.126 --> 00:40:22.187
are you asking me to see you

669
00:40:22.187 --> 00:40:24.224
to talk about your mysterious woman

670
00:40:24.224 --> 00:40:27.425
and your adventures as a stalking
photographer? Or are you--

671
00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:29.066
- Oh I smell some jealousy here.

672
00:40:29.066 --> 00:40:29.899
- [Virginia speaking on phone] (scoffs)

673
00:40:29.899 --> 00:40:31.987
right. well then I think
we can do it another day.

674
00:40:31.987 --> 00:40:34.219
after I've met my date.

675
00:40:34.219 --> 00:40:35.484
- Okay.

676
00:40:35.484 --> 00:40:36.817
Look. I promise.

677
00:40:38.631 --> 00:40:42.881
if we meet up tomorrow I
won't bring up my project.

678
00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:46.998
- [Virginia speaking on phone] Okay.

679
00:40:46.998 --> 00:40:49.490
then I'll cancel my plans.

680
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:51.108
No talking about that woman.

681
00:40:51.108 --> 00:40:53.126
- No. no. no. I promise.

682
00:40:53.126 --> 00:40:54.906
Okay. thanks.

683
00:40:54.906 --> 00:40:58.974
- [Virginia speaking on phone]
So where are you taking me?

684
00:40:58.974 --> 00:41:01.255
- Well. I haven't thought about that yet.

685
00:41:01.255 --> 00:41:04.160
- [Virginia speaking on phone] Typical.

686
00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.026
- Look. I'll let you know tomorrow.

687
00:41:06.026 --> 00:41:08.485
- [Virginia speaking on
phone] Okay. Perfect.

688
00:41:08.485 --> 00:41:10.150
- Okay.

689
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:11.733
- [Virginia speaking on phone] Good night.

690
00:41:11.733 --> 00:41:12.816
- Good night.

691
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.937
(rock music)

692
00:41:48.324 --> 00:41:51.562
Hey listen. should we
meet at 8:30 in Soho?

693
00:41:51.562 --> 00:41:53.053
'Cause there's this place
I think we should try.

694
00:41:53.053 --> 00:41:54.457
It's gonna be really nice.

695
00:41:54.457 --> 00:41:56.035
They don't do reservations though

696
00:41:56.035 --> 00:42:00.405
so we might need to queue but
it doesn't matter. does it?

697
00:42:00.405 --> 00:42:02.072
Anyway. let me know.

698
00:42:07.929 --> 00:42:10.512
(phone chimes)

699
00:42:14.214 --> 00:42:15.659
- [Virginia speaking on phone]
Hey. yes it's okay for me.

700
00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:16.636
Sounds good.

701
00:42:16.636 --> 00:42:20.013
I knew you wouldn't be
able to reserve us a table

702
00:42:20.013 --> 00:42:22.517
but if you say it's amazing. I trust you.

703
00:42:22.517 --> 00:42:24.297
See you later. friend.

704
00:42:24.297 --> 00:42:26.714
(rock music)

705
00:43:57.741 --> 00:43:59.001
(clears throat)

706
00:43:59.001 --> 00:44:00.584
- Hi V. listen I...

707
00:44:15.797 --> 00:44:17.696
Hi V. listen.

708
00:44:17.696 --> 00:44:20.587
I'm so. so. so sorry but I'm...

709
00:44:24.332 --> 00:44:27.499
I'm not gonna be able to meet tonight.

710
00:44:29.152 --> 00:44:30.363
I don't know what to do

711
00:44:30.363 --> 00:44:33.812
but I ate something at lunch

712
00:44:33.812 --> 00:44:37.447
and it's just making my
stomach go all over the place.

713
00:44:38.815 --> 00:44:40.781
I'm really sorry.

714
00:44:40.781 --> 00:44:44.809
We're gonna have to try and
do it at another time. I'll--

715
00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:46.976
I'll message you tomorrow.

716
00:45:29.983 --> 00:45:32.483
(tense music)

717
00:45:37.143 --> 00:45:39.976
(camera clicking)

718
00:47:00.676 --> 00:47:03.343
(phone ringing)

719
00:47:37.583 --> 00:47:40.583
(Knocks on the door)

720
00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.466
Hello?

721
00:47:57.466 --> 00:47:58.299
- Karl. it's me.

722
00:47:58.299 --> 00:48:00.529
I tried calling you.

723
00:48:00.529 --> 00:48:01.362
- Hey.

724
00:48:03.021 --> 00:48:03.920
- Hey. you all right?

725
00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.282
How are you feeling?

726
00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:08.444
- Fine. well no. I'm feeling
better actually. yeah.

727
00:48:08.444 --> 00:48:09.424
- Well. I didn't wanna go home.

728
00:48:09.424 --> 00:48:10.890
So I thought I'd check on you

729
00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:13.307
and I've bought you a banana.

730
00:48:14.592 --> 00:48:15.425
- Thanks.

731
00:48:15.425 --> 00:48:16.325
- Well. they say an apple a day

732
00:48:16.325 --> 00:48:18.158
keeps the doctor away.

733
00:48:19.031 --> 00:48:20.429
- But it's a banana.

734
00:48:20.429 --> 00:48:23.179
- All right. don't be ungrateful.

735
00:48:24.631 --> 00:48:27.822
Karl. this is getting weird now.

736
00:48:27.822 --> 00:48:29.752
You can't just leave that set up there.

737
00:48:29.752 --> 00:48:30.585
- No. I know. I don't.

738
00:48:30.585 --> 00:48:32.219
I only leave it there when
I know she's gonna be there.

739
00:48:32.219 --> 00:48:35.241
It just makes it easier
to take the pictures.

740
00:48:35.241 --> 00:48:36.248
- Right.

741
00:48:36.248 --> 00:48:39.481
You do understand how that
looks to the outside world?

742
00:48:39.481 --> 00:48:40.862
- Wait. what are you doing?

743
00:48:40.862 --> 00:48:42.382
- What?

744
00:48:42.382 --> 00:48:45.227
- Nothing. Sorry. It's just private.

745
00:48:45.227 --> 00:48:49.202
- Oh. well now you care about privacy?

746
00:48:49.202 --> 00:48:52.084
Karl. did you bail on me so
you could take pictures of her?

747
00:48:52.084 --> 00:48:52.986
- What?

748
00:48:52.986 --> 00:48:54.207
- Show me the laptop.

749
00:48:54.207 --> 00:48:55.040
- No. no.

750
00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:55.873
- Well. that means that you did.

751
00:48:55.873 --> 00:48:58.745
- That does not mean that I
did. - Yes. it fucking does.

752
00:48:58.745 --> 00:49:00.644
- Well. you don't understand
she wasn't alone tonight.

753
00:49:00.644 --> 00:49:02.758
- Sorry. why would I care about that?

754
00:49:02.758 --> 00:49:04.089
I'm fucking done.

755
00:49:04.089 --> 00:49:05.961
- Wait. wait. no please.

756
00:49:05.961 --> 00:49:07.153
I didn't think you'd understand.

757
00:49:07.153 --> 00:49:08.507
- Yeah. I don't care.

758
00:49:08.507 --> 00:49:09.340
- Seriously?

759
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:11.423
- You fucking lied to me.

760
00:50:05.084 --> 00:50:07.917
(dial tone beeps)

761
00:50:11.636 --> 00:50:13.606
- [Woman] I'm sorry but
the person you've called

762
00:50:13.606 --> 00:50:14.942
is not available.

763
00:50:14.942 --> 00:50:18.359
Please leave your message after the tone.

764
00:50:27.181 --> 00:50:29.644
(phone camera clicks)

765
00:50:29.644 --> 00:50:32.227
(phone chimes)

766
00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:39.896
Thank you very much. everyone.

767
00:50:39.896 --> 00:50:40.729
Thank you. it means an awful lot

768
00:50:40.729 --> 00:50:42.297
you all being here.

769
00:50:42.297 --> 00:50:43.130
I won't speak too much

770
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.581
as I'll let the pictures
speak for themselves.

771
00:50:45.581 --> 00:50:47.222
But what I can say is
that this interaction

772
00:50:47.222 --> 00:50:49.322
has not been staged.

773
00:50:49.322 --> 00:50:52.559
Everything you see here
is completely natural.

774
00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:53.761
as natural as it can be

775
00:50:53.761 --> 00:50:57.011
peaking through your neighbor's window.

776
00:50:58.346 --> 00:50:59.598
But in all seriousness.

777
00:50:59.598 --> 00:51:01.872
I think we all live in quite
a difficult time right now.

778
00:51:01.872 --> 00:51:03.955
And I think privacy is...

779
00:51:04.936 --> 00:51:06.577
It's not given out very often. is it?

780
00:51:06.577 --> 00:51:11.494
And I think we should all be
able to speak about that more.

781
00:51:12.907 --> 00:51:15.015
I mean. imagine the world
that we're gonna live in.

782
00:51:15.015 --> 00:51:17.181
We're not gonna be able
to hide from any cameras.

783
00:51:17.181 --> 00:51:18.514
Weird. isn't it?

784
00:51:20.832 --> 00:51:23.832
(Knocks on the door)

785
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.016
(knocks on the door)

786
00:51:35.511 --> 00:51:36.711
(Virginia knocking)

787
00:51:36.711 --> 00:51:38.461
- Coming. I'm coming.

788
00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.362
- You are unbelievable.

789
00:51:41.362 --> 00:51:43.180
You made me cancel a date
to go to dinner with you

790
00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.013
and then you bail on me

791
00:51:44.013 --> 00:51:45.607
to take pictures of that fucking woman.

792
00:51:45.607 --> 00:51:46.440
- Yeah but--

793
00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.093
- I do not wanna hear your justifications.

794
00:51:48.093 --> 00:51:49.343
I'm sick of it.

795
00:51:51.905 --> 00:51:53.171
Show me your photos.

796
00:51:53.171 --> 00:51:54.004
- What?

797
00:51:54.004 --> 00:51:55.173
- Just show me your fucking photos.

798
00:51:55.173 --> 00:51:56.006
- Well. I thought--

799
00:51:56.006 --> 00:51:59.089
- It doesn't matter what you thought.

800
00:52:01.228 --> 00:52:02.258
Oh my God. I knew it.

801
00:52:02.258 --> 00:52:03.258
- Knew what?

802
00:52:04.644 --> 00:52:06.414
- You have been so
obsessed with that woman

803
00:52:06.414 --> 00:52:07.930
you haven't seen who that man is.

804
00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:09.138
- Who?

805
00:52:09.138 --> 00:52:10.805
- That man is an MP.

806
00:52:13.086 --> 00:52:13.956
- An MP?

807
00:52:13.956 --> 00:52:16.008
- Yeah. Oh. how do you not know that Karl?

808
00:52:16.008 --> 00:52:19.399
He's been in the news
for the last three weeks.

809
00:52:19.399 --> 00:52:21.795
- It means I won't be
able to do the exhibition.

810
00:52:21.795 --> 00:52:23.224
- That isn't the point. Karl.

811
00:52:23.224 --> 00:52:25.946
The point is that he's
married and he has two kids.

812
00:52:25.946 --> 00:52:27.220
- So?

813
00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:28.786
- Are you serious?

814
00:52:28.786 --> 00:52:30.536
- She isn't his wife.

815
00:52:31.465 --> 00:52:34.736
Did you show her those photos?

816
00:52:34.736 --> 00:52:35.769
- I did. yeah.

817
00:52:35.769 --> 00:52:39.301
- Oh my God. You're so
fucking stupid sometimes.

818
00:52:39.301 --> 00:52:40.864
- Do you think she's using me?

819
00:52:40.864 --> 00:52:42.047
- Yes. Karl.

820
00:52:42.047 --> 00:52:44.270
Obviously she's using you.

821
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:46.357
What do you actually think that
she likes having a stranger

822
00:52:46.357 --> 00:52:48.524
taking photographs of her?

823
00:52:50.063 --> 00:52:51.363
- Fuck. what--

824
00:52:51.363 --> 00:52:52.572
What are we gonna do then?

825
00:52:52.572 --> 00:52:53.909
- No Karl. what are you gonna do?

826
00:52:53.909 --> 00:52:54.742
I am done.

827
00:52:56.005 --> 00:52:58.213
- No. I--

828
00:52:58.213 --> 00:53:00.363
I still wanted to go out with you. okay?

829
00:53:00.363 --> 00:53:01.196
You know that

830
00:53:01.196 --> 00:53:03.435
but this opportunity comes
up and presents itself

831
00:53:03.435 --> 00:53:05.876
and I gotta make use of it. you know?

832
00:53:05.876 --> 00:53:06.709
Give it a chance.

833
00:53:06.709 --> 00:53:08.313
- This is just a chance
for you to add something

834
00:53:08.313 --> 00:53:09.717
to your boring life.

835
00:53:09.717 --> 00:53:12.220
- No it's not. it's a
chance for me to create.

836
00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.284
- Oh my God.

837
00:53:13.284 --> 00:53:14.290
- Yeah. she might've been using me

838
00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:17.658
but it was still an
interaction I might use.

839
00:53:17.658 --> 00:53:21.056
If I'd known. I wouldn't
have canceled our date.

840
00:53:21.056 --> 00:53:22.175
I shouldn't have lied to you. okay?

841
00:53:22.175 --> 00:53:23.908
I'm really. really sorry about that.

842
00:53:23.908 --> 00:53:25.476
But I knew you'd react like this.

843
00:53:25.476 --> 00:53:26.309
I didn't know what to do.

844
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:27.142
I was stuck.

845
00:53:27.142 --> 00:53:28.282
I just--

846
00:53:28.282 --> 00:53:29.515
I panicked V.

847
00:53:48.031 --> 00:53:49.614
- So was it a date?

848
00:53:52.758 --> 00:53:55.687
(mumbles)

849
00:53:55.687 --> 00:53:56.520
- Yeah. I liked the i--.

850
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.353
- Shut up.

851
00:54:04.969 --> 00:54:06.906
Let's see what we can do.

852
00:54:06.906 --> 00:54:09.323
(soft music)

853
00:54:24.335 --> 00:54:26.582
- You really think I'm
gonna get in trouble?

854
00:54:26.582 --> 00:54:28.718
- Well. you took those pictures

855
00:54:28.718 --> 00:54:30.780
you could very easily be
dragged into this. yeah.

856
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.406
- Yeah. but nothing's happened yet.

857
00:54:32.406 --> 00:54:35.635
- Yeah but she has pictures
of her with her lover

858
00:54:35.635 --> 00:54:37.822
who also happens to be
a married politician.

859
00:54:37.822 --> 00:54:39.244
This could literally go in any direction.

860
00:54:39.244 --> 00:54:40.496
- Why. you don't think
maybe she just wants

861
00:54:40.496 --> 00:54:41.885
the photos for herself?

862
00:54:41.885 --> 00:54:43.075
- No.

863
00:54:43.075 --> 00:54:44.705
- Maybe she likes people
watching her have sex.

864
00:54:44.705 --> 00:54:47.272
- (scoffs) What? Are you
listening to yourself?

865
00:54:47.272 --> 00:54:48.387
That's absolutely ridiculous.

866
00:54:48.387 --> 00:54:51.345
Maybe in your dreams. Karl.

867
00:54:51.345 --> 00:54:53.240
- She was very complicit.

868
00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.299
- Yeah. because she's using you.

869
00:54:56.299 --> 00:54:57.452
- Yeah. Okay.

870
00:54:57.452 --> 00:54:58.891
You know what. I should
just delete all the photos--

871
00:54:58.891 --> 00:55:00.285
- Whoa. whoa. stop no.

872
00:55:00.285 --> 00:55:01.283
- Stop what?

873
00:55:01.283 --> 00:55:03.505
- That makes you look so guilty.

874
00:55:03.505 --> 00:55:05.756
The photos are very clearly
taken from this flat.

875
00:55:05.756 --> 00:55:07.461
- This is such a fucked up situation.

876
00:55:07.461 --> 00:55:09.159
Why am I gonna get into trouble for this?

877
00:55:09.159 --> 00:55:12.559
- Because it's a violation of privacy

878
00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:16.365
and we don't know what she
might do with those photos.

879
00:55:16.365 --> 00:55:18.495
- Wait. she asked me to take them.

880
00:55:18.495 --> 00:55:20.245
- Can you prove that?

881
00:55:24.217 --> 00:55:25.542
Look. we don't know

882
00:55:25.542 --> 00:55:28.060
if you are gonna be involved in this. but

883
00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:30.636
my God. is it gonna teach
you to stop thinking

884
00:55:30.636 --> 00:55:31.817
with your dick.

885
00:55:31.817 --> 00:55:32.952
- I'm not thinking with my dick.

886
00:55:32.952 --> 00:55:35.619
Can you please stop saying that.

887
00:55:38.013 --> 00:55:39.821
What are we gonna do?

888
00:55:39.821 --> 00:55:41.049
- Nothing.

889
00:55:41.049 --> 00:55:42.925
What would you wanna do?

890
00:55:42.925 --> 00:55:44.186
- I don't know maybe take
more photos of people

891
00:55:44.186 --> 00:55:45.026
from the window.

892
00:55:45.026 --> 00:55:48.833
make it more like a people's project.

893
00:55:48.833 --> 00:55:49.730
- Are you kidding me?

894
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:51.215
Have you not learnt anything from this?

895
00:55:51.215 --> 00:55:55.256
Just fucking find something
else to photograph. Karl.

896
00:55:55.256 --> 00:55:57.446
- Honestly. I just thought
it was a nice idea.

897
00:55:57.446 --> 00:55:59.520
- Anyway. I've gotta go.

898
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.872
I am far too tipsy and
I have work tomorrow.

899
00:56:02.872 --> 00:56:04.321
- That's fine.

900
00:56:04.321 --> 00:56:06.823
Listen. you know you're more
than welcome to stay here

901
00:56:06.823 --> 00:56:08.240
if you needed to.

902
00:56:09.677 --> 00:56:12.948
- Maybe we should go on a date first?

903
00:56:12.948 --> 00:56:13.781
- No. I didn't mean that--

904
00:56:13.781 --> 00:56:15.313
- (chuckles) Yeah. yeah.

905
00:56:15.313 --> 00:56:17.310
Always thinking with your dick.

906
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:18.284
- Are you kidding?

907
00:56:18.284 --> 00:56:19.798
I was trying to do something nice.

908
00:56:19.798 --> 00:56:20.631
- I know.

909
00:56:57.369 --> 00:57:00.369
(dial tone beeping)

910
00:57:05.427 --> 00:57:07.169
- [Woman] I'm sorry but
the person you called

911
00:57:07.169 --> 00:57:08.831
is not available.

912
00:57:08.831 --> 00:57:12.248
Please leave your message after the tone.

913
00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.036
- Karl. I need to go back in.

914
00:57:19.036 --> 00:57:19.934
What do you mean she's gone?

915
00:57:19.934 --> 00:57:20.817
- I mean. she's gone.

916
00:57:20.817 --> 00:57:22.644
I don't know where but
her furniture's gone.

917
00:57:22.644 --> 00:57:23.577
There's a removal van.

918
00:57:23.577 --> 00:57:24.410
- That's so weird.

919
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:26.372
- Yeah. it's really weird.

920
00:57:26.372 --> 00:57:27.934
- All right. well just
don't think about it. okay?

921
00:57:27.934 --> 00:57:28.767
Try and do something else.

922
00:57:28.767 --> 00:57:29.600
Think of something else.

923
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.433
Just relax.

924
00:57:30.433 --> 00:57:31.266
I need to go back in.

925
00:57:31.266 --> 00:57:32.099
- Okay. when people say relax--

926
00:57:32.099 --> 00:57:34.177
- Karl. just do something else. all right?

927
00:57:34.177 --> 00:57:36.123
- Okay. I tried but I can't.

928
00:57:36.123 --> 00:57:37.413
- Karl. I need to go back in.

929
00:57:37.413 --> 00:57:39.018
We're gonna have to do
this after work. okay?

930
00:57:39.018 --> 00:57:40.101
- Okay. okay.

931
00:57:41.446 --> 00:57:44.363
(soft tense music)

932
00:58:16.294 --> 00:58:19.211
(detective knocks)

933
00:58:21.069 --> 00:58:22.094
- Hi. - Hi.

934
00:58:22.094 --> 00:58:24.960
- I'm Detective Jay Morino.

935
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.225
I'm so sorry to bother you. sir.

936
00:58:26.225 --> 00:58:28.686
I'm currently working
on a case in the area

937
00:58:28.686 --> 00:58:29.917
and I was wondering if I could ask you

938
00:58:29.917 --> 00:58:32.019
just a couple of questions?

939
00:58:32.019 --> 00:58:33.001
Just a little chat

940
00:58:33.001 --> 00:58:34.845
that's my business card.

941
00:58:35.886 --> 00:58:37.958
- Yeah. please come on in.

942
00:58:37.958 --> 00:58:39.625
- Thank you so much.

943
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:44.012
- Yeah. just through here.

944
00:58:45.301 --> 00:58:47.659
Can I get you a cup of tea or coffee?

945
00:58:47.659 --> 00:58:48.492
- No. no. no.

946
00:58:48.492 --> 00:58:49.909
Thanks. I'm fine.

947
00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:55.098
I see you're a photographer.

948
00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:56.249
- Yeah. amateur.

949
00:58:56.249 --> 00:58:57.082
I just...

950
00:58:57.082 --> 00:58:57.943
I like taking pictures.

951
00:58:57.943 --> 00:59:01.371
- (laughs) Nice. very nice.

952
00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:04.954
Which kind of pictures
do you usually take?

953
00:59:06.554 --> 00:59:08.690
- Well. it depends really.

954
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:10.647
- Right. right yeah.

955
00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:14.181
Well. the reason why I'm
here is because it seems

956
00:59:14.181 --> 00:59:17.219
this very picture has been
taken from this building

957
00:59:17.219 --> 00:59:19.969
particularly from this apartment.

958
00:59:21.798 --> 00:59:22.965
- Yes. it was.

959
00:59:24.859 --> 00:59:28.303
- So I imagine you took this picture?

960
00:59:28.303 --> 00:59:29.720
- Yes sir. I did.

961
00:59:34.494 --> 00:59:36.911
- Anything you wanna tell me?

962
00:59:39.098 --> 00:59:40.226
- Yes sir. yeah.

963
00:59:40.226 --> 00:59:41.059
- Please.

964
00:59:42.384 --> 00:59:46.475
- Well. I started taking
pictures of this lady

965
00:59:46.475 --> 00:59:48.475
because she asked me to.

966
00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:53.580
- Come on. can you tell me something more?

967
00:59:55.432 --> 00:59:56.501
- Yeah. that sounds a bit crazy

968
00:59:56.501 --> 01:00:00.777
but I did start taking
pictures of. of her.

969
01:00:00.777 --> 01:00:03.110
I didn't even know her name.

970
01:00:04.727 --> 01:00:06.622
She called me once and said. would--

971
01:00:06.622 --> 01:00:07.660
"Would you take some more?"

972
01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:10.379
And then she wasn't alone.

973
01:00:10.379 --> 01:00:13.380
- So it seems like you have
been in contact with this woman

974
01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.680
but you don't know her name is.

975
01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:15.824
Is that what you're saying?

976
01:00:15.824 --> 01:00:16.657
- Exactly.

977
01:00:16.657 --> 01:00:19.936
Well. she communicated
with me through letters

978
01:00:19.936 --> 01:00:21.769
slipped under my door.

979
01:00:23.167 --> 01:00:26.629
- Okay. let me ask another question.

980
01:00:26.629 --> 01:00:30.629
Why did you start taking
pictures of this woman?

981
01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:32.795
- I don't know.

982
01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:36.480
I was just lost and it just happened.

983
01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.582
- Did she know you were
taking pictures of her?

984
01:00:41.199 --> 01:00:42.266
- No. not at the beginning.

985
01:00:42.266 --> 01:00:43.835
- That's a violation of privacy.

986
01:00:43.835 --> 01:00:46.173
- Okay but I didn't know that.

987
01:00:46.173 --> 01:00:49.136
- Well. let me help you to understand

988
01:00:49.136 --> 01:00:51.893
what you did. my friend.

989
01:00:51.893 --> 01:00:53.862
You just told me that you
started to take pictures

990
01:00:53.862 --> 01:00:56.746
of this woman without
her knowing you did so.

991
01:00:56.746 --> 01:00:59.200
And she was in her private
room. is that correct?

992
01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.033
- Yes. sir.

993
01:01:00.033 --> 01:01:01.176
- That's a violation of privacy.

994
01:01:01.176 --> 01:01:04.276
Article VIII of the Human Rights.

995
01:01:04.276 --> 01:01:05.139
- Well. I didn't. I honestly--

996
01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:05.972
- Whoa. whoa. whoa

997
01:01:05.972 --> 01:01:07.639
just listen. please.

998
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.739
I suggest you're careful
with what you say.

999
01:01:10.739 --> 01:01:12.283
There's much more going on here.

1000
01:01:12.283 --> 01:01:15.864
You could end up in serious
trouble. believe me.

1001
01:01:15.864 --> 01:01:19.656
This picture has been used
to blackmail my client.

1002
01:01:19.656 --> 01:01:21.040
- But wait. I didn't do it.

1003
01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.079
- Do you understand that
you will have to prove that?

1004
01:01:24.079 --> 01:01:26.285
You can not just say I didn't do it.

1005
01:01:26.285 --> 01:01:27.959
You know the penalty
for blackmail in the UK

1006
01:01:27.959 --> 01:01:30.924
can be a sentence of up
to 14 years in prison.

1007
01:01:30.924 --> 01:01:33.686
At the moment you are our only suspect.

1008
01:01:33.686 --> 01:01:35.846
- What about her?

1009
01:01:35.846 --> 01:01:36.879
- You mean the lady in the picture?

1010
01:01:36.879 --> 01:01:37.712
- Yes.

1011
01:01:37.712 --> 01:01:41.268
- There is no proof of what
you say. you understand that?

1012
01:01:41.268 --> 01:01:42.435
There is no proof.

1013
01:01:42.435 --> 01:01:43.821
She was in the picture.

1014
01:01:43.821 --> 01:01:46.356
She couldn't have taken
the picture herself.

1015
01:01:46.356 --> 01:01:47.342
- Yeah but she's the only other person

1016
01:01:47.342 --> 01:01:48.612
apart from me who has the picture.

1017
01:01:48.612 --> 01:01:50.195
- Can you prove it?

1018
01:01:52.616 --> 01:01:54.699
- I'm not sure if I can.

1019
01:01:56.572 --> 01:01:59.021
- And even if you did.
that's not the point.

1020
01:01:59.021 --> 01:02:00.343
You still don't get it.

1021
01:02:00.343 --> 01:02:01.292
The point is can you prove

1022
01:02:01.292 --> 01:02:02.927
you haven't been working with her?

1023
01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:03.891
Yes or no?

1024
01:02:03.891 --> 01:02:05.255
- No. I haven't been working with her

1025
01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:06.828
but she's moved out of her flat

1026
01:02:06.828 --> 01:02:09.009
and someone is clearly following her.

1027
01:02:09.009 --> 01:02:10.009
- Of course.

1028
01:02:11.064 --> 01:02:13.438
Who. someone who is stalking her?

1029
01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.157
- No no. that's not fair. I wasn't st--

1030
01:02:15.157 --> 01:02:16.518
I wasn't stalking her.

1031
01:02:16.518 --> 01:02:17.351
Look.

1032
01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:23.592
- What is this?

1033
01:02:23.592 --> 01:02:25.180
- This is from her.

1034
01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.067
She sent me two.

1035
01:02:26.067 --> 01:02:27.475
"More pictures tonight at 8:30.

1036
01:02:27.475 --> 01:02:31.063
"I want to see them Flat 11."

1037
01:02:31.063 --> 01:02:34.571
- Okay. put these inside.

1038
01:02:38.123 --> 01:02:40.640
Okay. let's see if this can help. okay?

1039
01:02:47.251 --> 01:02:48.501
One more thing.

1040
01:02:55.054 --> 01:02:57.668
if you don't wanna be charged
with violation of privacy

1041
01:02:57.668 --> 01:02:59.173
I personally suggest you to get rid

1042
01:02:59.173 --> 01:03:01.224
of those pictures immediately.

1043
01:03:01.224 --> 01:03:02.795
- Absolutely.

1044
01:03:02.795 --> 01:03:03.890
- And I think it might be the case

1045
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:05.559
you get yourself a lawyer.

1046
01:03:05.559 --> 01:03:06.465
- Law--. why?

1047
01:03:06.465 --> 01:03:07.880
I'm innocent.

1048
01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.192
- Well. I'm not the man

1049
01:03:09.192 --> 01:03:11.813
that will have to take that decision.

1050
01:03:11.813 --> 01:03:12.646
- Wait. what does that--

1051
01:03:12.646 --> 01:03:14.563
I'm literally innocent.

1052
01:03:16.095 --> 01:03:17.738
- Thank you for your time. okay?

1053
01:03:17.738 --> 01:03:20.304
Don't move. I know the way back.

1054
01:03:20.304 --> 01:03:21.637
Have a nice day.

1055
01:03:25.017 --> 01:03:26.184
- No. no. no. no.

1056
01:03:28.837 --> 01:03:29.670
Fuck.

1057
01:05:34.308 --> 01:05:36.727
- Did you really think
that was a good idea?

1058
01:05:36.727 --> 01:05:37.560
- Of course I did.

1059
01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.572
- What. the stalker and the exhibitionist?

1060
01:05:39.572 --> 01:05:40.836
- You don't understand that. okay?

1061
01:05:40.836 --> 01:05:42.917
You're just. it's very easy
to judge from your position.

1062
01:05:42.917 --> 01:05:44.227
- I don't judge.

1063
01:05:44.227 --> 01:05:45.483
- Yes. you do judge Virginia.

1064
01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:46.367
You judge all the time.

1065
01:05:46.367 --> 01:05:47.760
It's all you care about.

1066
01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.343
All you care about is what's legal.

1067
01:05:49.343 --> 01:05:50.401
what's right. what's wrong.

1068
01:05:50.401 --> 01:05:51.605
why people get into such situation?

1069
01:05:51.605 --> 01:05:53.517
You don't even think about why they behave

1070
01:05:53.517 --> 01:05:54.481
the way they behave.

1071
01:05:54.481 --> 01:05:55.490
You need to open your mind more--

1072
01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:56.439
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

1073
01:05:56.439 --> 01:05:57.850
I'm trying to fucking help you here.

1074
01:05:57.850 --> 01:05:59.646
Trying to get you out of the shit.

1075
01:05:59.646 --> 01:06:01.682
even though what you did goes
completely against my values.

1076
01:06:01.682 --> 01:06:04.567
Is that not being open-minded enough?

1077
01:06:04.567 --> 01:06:05.920
Jesus Christ. you can
deal with it yourself.

1078
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.587
- Okay. I'm sorry I
went against your values

1079
01:06:07.587 --> 01:06:09.125
okay. I won't do it again.

1080
01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:11.533
- Yeah. all right. You better not.

1081
01:06:21.875 --> 01:06:24.625
- He said I need to get a lawyer.

1082
01:06:27.845 --> 01:06:30.643
- Do you want me to ask at the office?

1083
01:06:30.643 --> 01:06:32.810
- Nah. it'll be a fortune.

1084
01:06:36.734 --> 01:06:38.600
- Can I ask you a stupid question?

1085
01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.433
- Yeah.

1086
01:06:41.637 --> 01:06:43.822
- Does your dad have
anything to do with you

1087
01:06:43.822 --> 01:06:46.748
trying to get into photography?

1088
01:06:46.748 --> 01:06:47.831
- Well. he's the reason it's taken me

1089
01:06:47.831 --> 01:06:49.914
until now to get into it.

1090
01:06:52.151 --> 01:06:54.818
- You never told me how he died.

1091
01:06:56.353 --> 01:06:58.078
- Yeah.

1092
01:06:58.078 --> 01:07:00.202
he was a photo reporter in Afghanistan.

1093
01:07:02.901 --> 01:07:04.818
not the safest of jobs.

1094
01:07:16.381 --> 01:07:17.705
- Listen. let's join forces.

1095
01:07:17.705 --> 01:07:18.538
See what we can do.

1096
01:07:18.538 --> 01:07:20.092
Maybe you don't need a lawyer.

1097
01:07:20.092 --> 01:07:21.017
- What do you mean?

1098
01:07:21.017 --> 01:07:22.996
- Well. what evidence
have you actually got?

1099
01:07:22.996 --> 01:07:25.709
- Not much but whatever she
sent me through the door

1100
01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:27.422
perhaps has fingerprints on it.

1101
01:07:27.422 --> 01:07:28.620
- Okay. that's good.

1102
01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:29.895
Let's keep that tight.

1103
01:07:29.895 --> 01:07:31.761
That could actually save your ass.

1104
01:07:31.761 --> 01:07:32.594
- Well yeah.

1105
01:07:32.594 --> 01:07:35.461
Actually the detective now
has that. which is good.

1106
01:07:35.461 --> 01:07:37.082
- You gave it to the detective?

1107
01:07:37.082 --> 01:07:37.915
- Yeah.

1108
01:07:37.915 --> 01:07:38.956
- Are you serious?

1109
01:07:38.956 --> 01:07:40.082
- Yeah. Why?

1110
01:07:40.082 --> 01:07:41.635
- You always keep your evidence.

1111
01:07:41.635 --> 01:07:44.022
You don't want them to
manipulate it or destroy it.

1112
01:07:44.022 --> 01:07:45.283
- I don't think he'll manipulate it.

1113
01:07:45.283 --> 01:07:47.372
He made me put it into this plastic sheet

1114
01:07:47.372 --> 01:07:49.066
and just told me it was procedure.

1115
01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:51.638
- Are you sure he was a detective?

1116
01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.513
- I think so.

1117
01:07:53.513 --> 01:07:54.355
Why would he not--

1118
01:07:54.355 --> 01:07:56.232
- What else did he tell you?

1119
01:07:56.232 --> 01:07:57.400
- Well. that I need to
delete all the pictures

1120
01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.817
and get a lawyer.

1121
01:07:59.661 --> 01:08:02.817
- I don't think that man's a detective.

1122
01:08:02.817 --> 01:08:03.650
- Are you serious?

1123
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:04.483
Who the hell was he then? How--

1124
01:08:04.483 --> 01:08:05.316
- Okay. it's all right.

1125
01:08:05.316 --> 01:08:06.149
It's all right.

1126
01:08:06.149 --> 01:08:08.482
Did you delete the pictures?

1127
01:08:09.847 --> 01:08:11.217
- Yes.

1128
01:08:11.217 --> 01:08:12.050
- Okay.

1129
01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:13.091
- Well. I was really drunk. I--

1130
01:08:13.091 --> 01:08:14.591
- All right. Okay.

1131
01:08:15.682 --> 01:08:17.265
Do you have prints?

1132
01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:20.750
- Well. I haven't developed the ones

1133
01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:22.938
that are in the film camera yet.

1134
01:08:22.938 --> 01:08:24.211
- All right.

1135
01:08:24.211 --> 01:08:26.043
Okay. let's go ahead and develop that.

1136
01:08:26.043 --> 01:08:26.876
- What now?

1137
01:08:26.876 --> 01:08:27.709
- Yes. now.

1138
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:28.542
- Yeah.

1139
01:08:54.781 --> 01:08:55.733
Okay. Right.

1140
01:08:55.733 --> 01:08:57.433
This is from the beginning
where you can tell that

1141
01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:58.842
she doesn't know I'm
taking pictures of her.

1142
01:08:58.842 --> 01:09:00.008
- Yeah we know that.

1143
01:09:00.008 --> 01:09:00.841
- All right.

1144
01:09:00.841 --> 01:09:02.697
- God there's just so
much art in this project.

1145
01:09:02.697 --> 01:09:03.602
Isn't there Karl?

1146
01:09:03.602 --> 01:09:05.489
- That's not funny.

1147
01:09:05.489 --> 01:09:06.838
- Wait is that the moment
where she first noticed

1148
01:09:06.838 --> 01:09:07.968
you were taking pictures of her?

1149
01:09:07.968 --> 01:09:08.823
- Yeah. exactly.

1150
01:09:08.823 --> 01:09:09.660
- Okay. Perfect. go on.

1151
01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:10.656
- Right. so you can see from now on

1152
01:09:10.656 --> 01:09:12.127
that she'd been very complicit.

1153
01:09:12.127 --> 01:09:13.397
- Yeah. she is.

1154
01:09:13.397 --> 01:09:14.846
- Look. she's posing. you know?

1155
01:09:14.846 --> 01:09:15.910
- You can even see in this one

1156
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:17.774
that she wants to be
photographed with him?

1157
01:09:17.774 --> 01:09:18.607
- Yeah. see I told you.

1158
01:09:18.607 --> 01:09:20.189
she's pushing all the
action to the window innit?.

1159
01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:21.022
- This is huge.

1160
01:09:21.022 --> 01:09:22.006
I mean. at the very least

1161
01:09:22.006 --> 01:09:24.645
we can prove that she knows
she's being photographed.

1162
01:09:24.645 --> 01:09:25.905
- Yeah I know. I just don't
know if we could prove

1163
01:09:25.905 --> 01:09:27.139
that she has the photos

1164
01:09:27.139 --> 01:09:31.051
or that I'm not working
with her. you know?

1165
01:09:31.051 --> 01:09:33.211
- Why don't we just contact the MP?

1166
01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:34.406
- Can we do that?

1167
01:09:34.406 --> 01:09:35.867
- Yeah. I mean. you
can get a general email

1168
01:09:35.867 --> 01:09:37.118
for almost all MPs.

1169
01:09:37.118 --> 01:09:40.185
And then we just ask if he
wants to see these pictures.

1170
01:09:40.185 --> 01:09:42.047
- What do you think he'd respond?

1171
01:09:42.047 --> 01:09:43.424
- I mean. something
like this is definitely

1172
01:09:43.424 --> 01:09:45.154
gonna grab his attention. isn't it?

1173
01:09:45.154 --> 01:09:46.229
Plus it makes you look more innocent

1174
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:47.414
if you're the one helping him figure out

1175
01:09:47.414 --> 01:09:50.279
who's trying to blackmail him.

1176
01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:51.112
- Yeah. Okay.

1177
01:09:51.112 --> 01:09:52.098
Yeah. Let's do that.

1178
01:09:52.098 --> 01:09:53.670
- Okay. I'll look for contacts.

1179
01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:55.197
you start drafting an email.

1180
01:09:55.197 --> 01:09:56.697
- All right. Okay.

1181
01:10:00.953 --> 01:10:03.370
(soft music)

1182
01:10:31.392 --> 01:10:32.225
Hey.

1183
01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:07.503
- Hey.

1184
01:11:15.239 --> 01:11:16.484
- Good morning.

1185
01:11:16.484 --> 01:11:17.317
- (Whispers) Morning.

1186
01:11:47.088 --> 01:11:49.588
(phone rings)

1187
01:13:34.878 --> 01:13:36.590
- [Karl's Boss] Man's
quest to chase his dreams

1188
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:38.064
it's just that.

1189
01:13:38.064 --> 01:13:39.047
a quest.

1190
01:13:40.584 --> 01:13:41.417
And in the meantime.

1191
01:13:42.742 --> 01:13:44.066
life happens.

1192
01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:16.334
(soft tense music)

1193
01:15:41.813 --> 01:15:45.099
- Wait. should I be trying
this or would you like to?

1194
01:15:45.099 --> 01:15:46.386
Is it ladies first? How does it--

1195
01:15:46.386 --> 01:15:47.602
- He's being a dick.

1196
01:15:47.602 --> 01:15:48.585
Ignore him.

1197
01:15:48.585 --> 01:15:50.252
That's fine. Thanks.

1198
01:15:55.277 --> 01:15:56.709
Stop doing that.

1199
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:57.910
You're just taking the piss.

1200
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:59.025
You're gonna start pissing me off soon.

1201
01:15:59.025 --> 01:16:00.525
- Okay. I'm sorry.

1202
01:16:01.825 --> 01:16:03.094
- You do see what I mean. though.

1203
01:16:03.094 --> 01:16:05.696
I chose that wine and
then you get to taste it.

1204
01:16:05.696 --> 01:16:06.913
What is that about?

1205
01:16:06.913 --> 01:16:08.431
- Maybe he's trying to
save you the embarrassment

1206
01:16:08.431 --> 01:16:10.900
of having to act like you
actually know good wine.

1207
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.987
- Oh what. and you do actually
know good wine. do you?

1208
01:16:12.987 --> 01:16:13.820
- Absolutely not.

1209
01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.194
Not at all. not at all.

1210
01:16:15.194 --> 01:16:16.942
But I give off the impression that I do.

1211
01:16:16.942 --> 01:16:20.358
You know it's one of the
burdens of being a man.

1212
01:16:20.358 --> 01:16:21.357
- Just shut up.

1213
01:16:21.357 --> 01:16:22.940
I'm done with you.

1214
01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:30.585
You still need to tell me
what he actually said to you.

1215
01:16:30.585 --> 01:16:31.671
- Who?

1216
01:16:31.671 --> 01:16:32.838
- Oh. come on.

1217
01:16:40.744 --> 01:16:42.244
- Her name is Cam.

1218
01:16:45.289 --> 01:16:47.784
We used to work together and then.

1219
01:16:49.935 --> 01:16:51.983
about a year ago.

1220
01:16:51.983 --> 01:16:53.249
we fell for each other.

1221
01:16:55.258 --> 01:16:57.558
We started going out in secret.

1222
01:17:00.634 --> 01:17:04.626
A few months passed and she
asked me to leave my wife.

1223
01:17:06.159 --> 01:17:07.326
That was fair.

1224
01:17:12.345 --> 01:17:13.262
I couldn't.

1225
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:15.263
But maybe I should have.

1226
01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:17.727
things weren't working in any case but.

1227
01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:21.142
the thought of hurting my two

1228
01:17:22.818 --> 01:17:23.987
wonderful daughters

1229
01:17:23.987 --> 01:17:25.571
I...

1230
01:17:25.571 --> 01:17:26.404
couldn't.

1231
01:17:30.084 --> 01:17:32.236
And now a year has passed.

1232
01:17:32.236 --> 01:17:34.623
and I'm still seeing Cam. and...

1233
01:17:36.531 --> 01:17:39.998
obviously things are
not going well at home.

1234
01:17:43.894 --> 01:17:45.412
My wife's hired a private detective

1235
01:17:45.412 --> 01:17:49.912
to get proof of my infidelity
and she wants a divorce.

1236
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:57.637
I'm not being blackmailed.

1237
01:17:59.346 --> 01:18:01.346
I don't think I will be.

1238
01:18:02.752 --> 01:18:05.841
You've sent those photographs to my wife.

1239
01:18:05.841 --> 01:18:07.958
She'll use them to get
a better settlement.

1240
01:18:07.958 --> 01:18:09.589
- Wait. I'm sorry. what?

1241
01:18:09.589 --> 01:18:10.814
- It's okay.

1242
01:18:13.343 --> 01:18:16.868
Should have had the guts to
face the situation before.

1243
01:18:18.722 --> 01:18:21.931
- How did your wife know that
I was taking the pictures?

1244
01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:25.519
- The detective that came to visit you.

1245
01:18:25.519 --> 01:18:28.432
He must've seen you doing his job for him.

1246
01:18:28.432 --> 01:18:30.130
Easy as that.

1247
01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:30.963
- Okay.

1248
01:18:30.963 --> 01:18:32.471
And what...

1249
01:18:32.471 --> 01:18:33.629
What about Cam?

1250
01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:39.851
Wasn't she aware that she
was being photographed?

1251
01:18:42.061 --> 01:18:44.527
- I probably shouldn't
tell you about this but...

1252
01:18:45.935 --> 01:18:47.968
we had many arguments about it.

1253
01:18:47.968 --> 01:18:49.415
Not that I'm against it.

1254
01:18:49.415 --> 01:18:51.906
I think everybody should be
free to do whatever they want.

1255
01:18:51.906 --> 01:18:52.739
It's just.

1256
01:18:54.081 --> 01:18:56.039
because of what I do.

1257
01:18:56.039 --> 01:18:56.872
you know?

1258
01:18:56.872 --> 01:18:58.858
It's not the best thing.

1259
01:19:03.979 --> 01:19:05.750
She finds pleasure in being looked at

1260
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:07.667
in intimate situations.

1261
01:19:10.485 --> 01:19:11.818
It's a big mess.

1262
01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:16.423
She said she'd seen you taking photographs

1263
01:19:16.423 --> 01:19:19.178
and you were just some young guy.

1264
01:19:19.178 --> 01:19:20.145
- I don't believe it.

1265
01:19:20.145 --> 01:19:20.978
- I swear.

1266
01:19:20.978 --> 01:19:22.183
He just said to me that
he thought the idea

1267
01:19:22.183 --> 01:19:25.199
of the exhibition was not bad.

1268
01:19:25.199 --> 01:19:26.739
- No. but I'm saying I don't believe

1269
01:19:26.739 --> 01:19:29.620
that woman actually liked
being photographed like that.

1270
01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:30.453
- You can't accept that.

1271
01:19:30.453 --> 01:19:33.330
- No. I just think you're making it up.

1272
01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:34.373
- No. I swear on my life.

1273
01:19:34.373 --> 01:19:37.544
That's the whole reason why
she kept the curtains open.

1274
01:19:37.544 --> 01:19:40.196
- And well. you're still not justified.

1275
01:19:40.196 --> 01:19:41.144
- For what?

1276
01:19:41.144 --> 01:19:42.889
- For violating her privacy.

1277
01:19:42.889 --> 01:19:44.897
You didn't know that she
liked it before you started.

1278
01:19:44.897 --> 01:19:45.730
did you?

1279
01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:47.985
- True but I was exploring.

1280
01:19:47.985 --> 01:19:49.639
- You were exploring?

1281
01:19:49.639 --> 01:19:50.472
Right.

1282
01:19:53.228 --> 01:19:55.693
- I shouldn't say it
but if you want privacy.

1283
01:19:55.693 --> 01:19:58.289
you should keep your curtains closed.

1284
01:19:58.289 --> 01:19:59.569
- That's so ridiculous.

1285
01:19:59.569 --> 01:20:01.271
Just respect each other's privacy.

1286
01:20:01.271 --> 01:20:02.410
It's not that hard.

1287
01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:04.172
- Okay well. good luck with that.

1288
01:20:04.172 --> 01:20:06.258
- Oh gosh. you can be a dick.

1289
01:20:06.258 --> 01:20:07.158
I didn't want to put up with you.

1290
01:20:07.158 --> 01:20:08.862
- No. no. no. no. no.

1291
01:20:08.862 --> 01:20:10.679
You know why. because you
know that deep down inside

1292
01:20:10.679 --> 01:20:12.146
I'm a good guy.

1293
01:20:12.146 --> 01:20:13.002
A nice person.

1294
01:20:13.002 --> 01:20:17.185
- Good guy. just makes
some very weird choices.

1295
01:20:17.185 --> 01:20:19.602
(both laugh)

1296
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:23.660
- This is to us.

1297
01:20:25.275 --> 01:20:27.108
and our sexist waiter.

1298
01:20:28.326 --> 01:20:30.159
- And your exhibition.

1299
01:20:37.175 --> 01:20:38.676
Is Richard coming?

1300
01:20:38.676 --> 01:20:40.173
- No. he can't.

1301
01:20:40.173 --> 01:20:41.803
Quite a bit too soon for him innit?

1302
01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:43.922
Although. Cam's gonna be there though.

1303
01:20:43.922 --> 01:20:46.390
- Finally get to meet your muse.

1304
01:20:47.232 --> 01:20:48.659
- You are so jealous. aren't you?

1305
01:20:48.659 --> 01:20:49.647
- No. I'm not.

1306
01:20:49.647 --> 01:20:50.480
- I really think you are.

1307
01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.545
- No. I'm not.

1308
01:20:51.545 --> 01:20:52.708
(indistinct)

1309
01:20:52.708 --> 01:20:53.575
- I'm not jealous.

1310
01:20:53.575 --> 01:20:54.408
- I think it's sweet.

1311
01:20:54.408 --> 01:20:55.241
I don't think it's a bad thing.

1312
01:20:55.241 --> 01:20:56.074
- Sweet?

1313
01:20:56.074 --> 01:20:57.704
Don't fucking call me sweet.

1314
01:20:57.704 --> 01:20:58.537
- I'm not.

1315
01:20:58.537 --> 01:20:59.370
- You piece of shit.

1316
01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:01.373
- I think jealousy is a
strong add to a relationship.

1317
01:21:01.373 --> 01:21:02.206
- Is it?

1318
01:21:02.206 --> 01:21:03.039
- Yeah.

1319
01:21:03.039 --> 01:21:04.095
- I think that's the worst
thing you could possibly--

1320
01:21:04.095 --> 01:21:05.544
- Why?

1321
01:21:05.544 --> 01:21:07.227
- Can I throw you in the river?

1322
01:21:07.227 --> 01:21:08.893
- No. - Can I throw you in the river?

1323
01:21:08.893 --> 01:21:11.121
- Are you serious? Oh yes you--

1324
01:21:11.121 --> 01:21:16.088
(Virginia laughing)

1325
01:21:16.088 --> 01:21:19.404
(Both laughing)

1326
01:21:20.561 --> 01:21:22.978
(soft music)

1327
01:21:38.758 --> 01:21:40.675
- A bit shit. isn't it?

1328
01:21:44.769 --> 01:21:47.228
It's gonna do really well. I know it.

1329
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.557
Should we head?

1330
01:21:50.557 --> 01:21:51.390
- Yeah.

1331
01:21:52.809 --> 01:21:55.226
(soft music)
