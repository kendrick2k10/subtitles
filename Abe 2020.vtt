3
00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:01.964
<i>But this is.</i>

4
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.665

5

6

7

8
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.074
<i>I really just prefer Abe.</i>

expensive clothes.</i>

10
00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:24.151
<i>selfies. money.
fancy musicians. celebrities.</i>

11
00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:27.023
<i>I found out I enjoy food.</i>

12
00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:30.190
<i>I just can't resist it.</i>

13
00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:31.926
<i>Summer plans?</i>

14
00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:34.063
<i>Chase flavors in
Brooklyn. New York.</i>

<i>People say his hands don't feel
the heat of the oven anymore</i>

17
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:48.710
<i>because he's been doing it
for so long.</i>

18
00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:54.116
<i>Music to my stomach.</i>

19
00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:05.758
<i>Only thing I like
more than food?</i>

20
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.727
<i>Cooking.</i>

21
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.629
<i>I already know some tricks
in the kitchen.</i>

22
00:03:09.631 --> 00:03:11.131
<i>Cooking is way better
than talking with</i>

23

<i>It's not that
I don't have friends.</i>

25
00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:19.173
<i>I do. On the Internet.</i>

26
00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:22.144
<i>I never met them offline.
but who cares?</i>

27
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.155
<i>Okay. let's focus
on my birthday cake.</i>

28
00:03:35.024 --> 00:03:37.024
I don't want to give them
any reason

29
00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:40.760
to open their mouths about.
you know. whatever.

30
00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.329
But what you
want them to do?

31
00:03:42.331 --> 00:03:44.264
I mean. they're...
That's what they are.

32
00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:48.969
They're old. grumpy.
they give us a hard time.

33
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:50.670
but they're our family.
and we love them.

34
00:03:50.672 --> 00:03:53.140
What's that?

35
00:03:53.142 --> 00:03:55.943
- It's a cake.
- Wait. A cake?

36
00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:58.178
You did the cake on your own
birthday? That's amazing.

37
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.849
Yeah. I mean. I want to.

38
00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:04.751
There's no baking powder?

39
00:04:04.753 --> 00:04:06.686
Mm.

40
00:04:06.688 --> 00:04:08.022
I checked.
There's only baking soda.

41
00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:09.655
That's the same thing.

42
00:04:09.657 --> 00:04:12.026
No. Mom. Baking soda is
pure sodium bicarbonate.

43
00:04:12.028 --> 00:04:13.327
Speak English. please.

44
00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.129
I don't understand
what that means.

45
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:17.730
Oh. here we go.
Cream of tartar.

46
00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:20.034
I can add this to baking soda
and make baking powder.

47
00:04:20.036 --> 00:04:21.835
Oh. no. I don't think
that's good.

48
00:04:21.837 --> 00:04:23.736
No. Mom. it's fine.

49
00:04:23.738 --> 00:04:25.806
This is the acid.
and baking soda is the base.

50
00:04:25.808 --> 00:04:27.374
When you mix them
and add liquid.

51
00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:29.877
it makes carbon dioxide.
which are bubbles.

52
00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.211
which is what you need
to make the cake rise.

53
00:04:31.213 --> 00:04:32.312
Basic chemistry.

54
00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:33.914
We're raising Walter White.

55
00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:35.382
Wait. are you actually sure
about that?

56
00:04:35.384 --> 00:04:37.051
That is never gonna work.

57
00:04:37.053 --> 00:04:39.019
Okay. I'll just use
the baking soda.

58
00:04:39.021 --> 00:04:40.287
but I don't think it'll rise.

59
00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.288
- Hello!
- Hi. Dad.

60
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.023
Hi. Welcome.

61
00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:45.059
The Palestinian perspective
is largely untold.

62
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:46.326
My op-ed speaks to that.

63
00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:48.962
Simply not true.

64
00:04:48.964 --> 00:04:51.832
That's because you only see
the truth you want to see.

65
00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:55.335
Israel is the only country.
besides the U.S..

66
00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.405
that militarily occupied
another people.

67
00:04:58.407 --> 00:05:01.341
Fifty years now. Benjamin.
Fifty years.

68
00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:06.847
Your article does not have
the whole story.

69
00:05:08.184 --> 00:05:10.184
What's the latest in cat videos?

70
00:05:10.186 --> 00:05:15.089
Politics off the table... now.
Okay. Aba?

71
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:18.425
Happy birthday. sweetheart!

72
00:05:22.264 --> 00:05:24.064
Cheers! Cheers. cheers. cheers.

73
00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:25.365
All right. eat up.
eat up. guys.

74
00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:27.201
Abe has been
working on this all day.

75
00:05:27.203 --> 00:05:29.269
- You made all this? Ooh!
- Yes!

76
00:05:29.271 --> 00:05:33.040
He's basically taken over
the whole kitchen. right. bubbe?

77
00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:34.174
I hope you guys like it.

78
00:05:34.176 --> 00:05:36.709
Yeah.

79
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:39.046
These crazy noodle sandwiches
are the shit.

80
00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:40.746
It's a ramen taco.

81
00:05:40.748 --> 00:05:42.282
Of course it is!

82
00:05:42.284 --> 00:05:44.251
You are twelve.
Next year is a big one.

83
00:05:44.253 --> 00:05:47.287
If you do your bar mitzvah
next year.

84
00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.090
you will be a man!

85
00:05:50.092 --> 00:05:52.059
One hundred percent.

86
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:54.795
All right. Aba.
sit down. all right.

87
00:05:54.797 --> 00:05:59.833
Well. I don't mean to interfere.
but it's the time.

88
00:05:59.835 --> 00:06:01.401
Yeah. no. thank you so much
for not interfering.

89
00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.137
I really appreciate that.

90
00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.275
Technically. you are a Jew
from your mother.

91
00:06:08.277 --> 00:06:11.812
Technically. he is a Muslim
because of his father.

92
00:06:11.814 --> 00:06:15.382
I'm sorry. is Atheism
matrilineal or patrilineal?

93
00:06:15.384 --> 00:06:18.118
- I don't know.
- Technically. I forgot.

94
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.989
Yeah. so why don't we take this
off the table for now?

95
00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:24.091
Okay? We're done
with this conversation

96
00:06:24.093 --> 00:06:26.126
and this topic. okay?

97
00:06:26.128 --> 00:06:27.961
What the mother wants
is important.

98
00:06:27.963 --> 00:06:30.097
I want to.

99
00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.199
- Want to what?
- What?

100
00:06:32.201 --> 00:06:34.201
I want to do the bar mitzvah.

101
00:06:34.203 --> 00:06:38.472
Abe. Abe. Abe. hold on here.

102
00:06:38.474 --> 00:06:41.141
And the Muslim band.

103
00:06:41.143 --> 00:06:42.910
Just relax for one second.

104
00:06:42.912 --> 00:06:44.444
And everyone I know
is doing their bar mitzvahs.

105
00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:47.347
And like go to mosque
and stuff.

106
00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:49.216
Okay. that's
hell to the no.

107
00:06:49.218 --> 00:06:50.784
I can do both things.

108
00:06:50.786 --> 00:06:55.489
Habibi. you can try both.
but you cannot be both.

109
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:59.860
Mm. You have to choose.

110
00:06:59.862 --> 00:07:02.829
You gotta get a live band
for you bar mitzvah

111
00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:04.998
- and a huge chocolate fountain!
- Uncle Ari!

112
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.335
I'm so sorry. guys.
He doesn't have to choose...

113
00:07:08.337 --> 00:07:10.237
because we chose for him.
and we chose nothing.

114
00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:11.538
- Yeah. we chose nothing.
- Really?

115
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.307
Yeah. really.

116
00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:21.749

I mean. I did a better job
in my sixth-grade cooking class

144

than that piece of shit.

145
00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:06.153
Did you have any idea

146
00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:09.990
that he wanted to try
a bar mitzvah or mosque?

147
00:09:09.992 --> 00:09:11.925
- Did you have any idea?
- Of course not.

148
00:09:11.927 --> 00:09:13.193
I thought we were
all enjoying

149

a happy godless
existence together.

00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:17.099
Well. apparently we're not.

You know what I think?

152
00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:25.272
I think he will never be Muslim

153
00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:26.340
or Jewish enough
for these people.

154
00:09:26.342 --> 00:09:28.241

Oh. I'm sorry.

00:10:37.079 --> 00:10:39.679
on our wedding day
to prove a point about...

176
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:41.417
What was it?
Female sexuality.

177
00:11:56.525 --> 00:11:58.427
Whoa! What are you doing?

178
00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.262
Wanna buy one?

179
00:12:02.264 --> 00:12:04.264
Uh. I can help you guys out.

180
00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:05.665
No. I'm good. I don't need it.

181
00:12:05.667 --> 00:12:07.267
It looks like
you're pretty busy.

182
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:08.568
We don't need help.
We don't need help.

183
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.270
Go home. kid.

184
00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:12.606
- Where's your parent?
- They're...

185
00:12:12.608 --> 00:12:16.378
Where's your parent?

186
00:12:18.146 --> 00:12:19.579
Mixing flavors?

187
00:12:19.581 --> 00:12:22.516
Fresh lemonade?

188
00:12:22.518 --> 00:12:27.556
Go. Leave. Right now.
Leave. Go home. Thank you.

189
00:12:54.884 --> 00:12:57.386
Hey. kid. Try this.

190
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.422
Oh. thank you.

191
00:13:04.827 --> 00:13:09.229
It's acarajé. From Brazil.
my country. you know.

192
00:13:09.231 --> 00:13:11.531
This is really good.

193
00:13:11.533 --> 00:13:13.166
You know. it actually
kinda tastes like

194
00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:15.135
the falafels my grandmas make.

195
00:13:15.137 --> 00:13:17.637
I tried to mix it a little bit
with Jamaican food.

196
00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:20.206
Oh. yeah. And that's fusion?

197
00:13:20.208 --> 00:13:21.241
And that's fusion.

198
00:13:21.243 --> 00:13:22.910
Wow.

199
00:13:22.912 --> 00:13:25.813
What's your story?
Where are you from?

200
00:13:25.815 --> 00:13:26.881
Like neighborhood?

201
00:13:26.883 --> 00:13:29.249
No. no. Background.

202
00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:32.686
Oh. It's a little
confusing. but...

203
00:13:32.688 --> 00:13:34.688
I'm half Palestinian-Muslim.

204
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.891
and then half Israeli-Jewish.

205
00:13:36.893 --> 00:13:39.359
and then American-Brooklyn.

206
00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:40.828
Oh. and Gryffindor.

207
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.530
- It's hard.
- Oh. bro.

208
00:13:43.532 --> 00:13:45.800
Jesus!

209
00:13:45.802 --> 00:13:48.770
Do your parents know
you're out this late?

210
00:13:51.607 --> 00:13:53.707
Sure.

211
00:13:53.709 --> 00:13:55.709
- Not really. but...
- I know.

212
00:13:55.711 --> 00:13:57.277
Now you get off
the streets. okay?

213
00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:59.312
Okay.

214
00:13:59.314 --> 00:14:01.949
<i>Birthday cake
strikes back.</i>

215
00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:05.318
<i>This time. my way.
Savta showed me</i>

216
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.754
<i>when you mix cream of tartar
with baking soda.</i>

217
00:14:07.756 --> 00:14:10.290
<i>it makes baking powder.</i>

218
00:14:10.292 --> 00:14:11.458
<i>Basic science.</i>

219
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.759
<i>#facts.</i>

220
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:14.427
<i>#wizard.</i>

221
00:14:14.429 --> 00:14:16.365
<i>#Ithinkitsrising.</i>

222
00:14:26.708 --> 00:14:28.809
Lemon poppy cakes?

223
00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:30.778
You're not impressing anyone.

224
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.512
Look. we get you're lonely.

225
00:14:32.514 --> 00:14:34.851
But if you wanna get some girls.
all you have to do is ask.

226
00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:42.255
Well. don't be
so dismissive about it.

227
00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:45.492
What? Diplomacy
is just logic. you know.

228
00:14:45.494 --> 00:14:47.293
It sounds
really boring.

229
00:14:47.295 --> 00:14:48.762
It's not. It's gonna be
really good for...

230
00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:51.631
- Hey. there he is!
- Hi.

231
00:14:51.633 --> 00:14:54.001
We were actually
talking about camp.

232
00:14:54.003 --> 00:14:58.405
And we're thinking for you.
Model UN.

233
00:14:58.407 --> 00:14:59.639
Interfaith.

234
00:14:59.641 --> 00:15:00.808
Oh. come on. babe.

235
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.010
Wait. wait. I'm going to camp?

236
00:15:03.012 --> 00:15:05.478
The thing is you can't
go around Brooklyn

237
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.948
like you're on a frickin'
food tour. right?

238
00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.884
- That's true.
- Maybe I could work.

239
00:15:09.886 --> 00:15:11.685
Here you go.

240
00:15:11.687 --> 00:15:13.520
That's not funny.

241
00:15:13.522 --> 00:15:15.790
Oh. Wait a minute.

242
00:15:15.792 --> 00:15:18.658
Look. this actually looks good.
A cooking camp.

243
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.861
That sounds like fun.

244
00:15:20.863 --> 00:15:23.396
- I guess.
- Yes! Okay.

245
00:15:23.398 --> 00:15:24.965
Maybe you'll meet some kids
who are into food and stuff.

246
00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:27.333
Make some new friends.

247
00:15:27.335 --> 00:15:30.336
It's not like an adult class
where I'm actually learn stuff.

248
00:15:30.338 --> 00:15:33.473
I'm sorry. Are you an adult?

249
00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:36.643
Can you work with us. please?
Okay? Humor me.

250
00:15:36.645 --> 00:15:38.511
It's that or UN.
Which one?

251
00:15:38.513 --> 00:15:39.816
UN! UN! Say UN.

252
00:15:42.684 --> 00:15:44.885
Now you take a cup

253
00:15:44.887 --> 00:15:49.990
and scoop it
into your bowl of sugar.

254
00:15:49.992 --> 00:15:54.494
So the food coloring makes
our desserts really colorful.

255
00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.763
Like if you put the blue
food coloring with the green

256
00:15:56.765 --> 00:15:59.432
and put it together.
you get yellow.

257
00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:03.070
Or you put the red and the blue
together. you get...

258
00:16:03.072 --> 00:16:05.405
<i>Excuse me. people.
I'm a professional chef.</i>

259
00:16:05.407 --> 00:16:07.373
<i>I can do that
with my eyes closed.</i>

260
00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:09.277
<i>#kissmyass.</i>

261
00:16:43.612 --> 00:16:46.080
Come on. let's go. guys!
Come on! Let's go!

262
00:16:46.082 --> 00:16:47.882
Let's do this.

263
00:16:47.884 --> 00:16:49.950
We gotta be out in three hours.

264
00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:51.384
We're gonna hit the streets
in three hours.

265
00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:51.954
and we're drippin' in here.

266
00:16:59.962 --> 00:17:01.496
Let's go. let's go.
come on. baby.

267
00:17:44.073 --> 00:17:46.075
Gonna go with the duck.

268
00:17:50.579 --> 00:17:52.581
Mmm!

269
00:18:14.703 --> 00:18:15.770
It's like music.

270
00:18:22.778 --> 00:18:23.777
Hey!

271
00:18:23.779 --> 00:18:25.846
- Sorry.
- Hey. hey. hey!

272
00:18:25.848 --> 00:18:27.580
American-Brooklyn!

273
00:18:27.582 --> 00:18:30.050
- Hey!
- Yeah. what are you doing here?

274
00:18:30.052 --> 00:18:31.787
I came here
to bring you something.

275
00:18:35.224 --> 00:18:38.893
Please. don't do that again.
On the ground.

276
00:18:38.895 --> 00:18:42.064
Oh. so. I've been trying
to cook fusion food.

277
00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:49.769
What is this. exactly?

278
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:52.505
Well. it's a ramen taco.

279
00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:55.209
It's my take on the ramen taco.

280
00:18:55.211 --> 00:18:56.977
I was planning on
calling it. um...

281
00:18:56.979 --> 00:18:57.914
Terrible.

282
00:19:00.783 --> 00:19:03.984
Wait. wait. you didn't try it.
Just take a bite.

283
00:19:03.986 --> 00:19:05.618
Sorry. kid.

284
00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.589
You are mixing fusion
with confusion.

285
00:19:08.858 --> 00:19:10.858
You made something bold.

286
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.094
Next time.
make something good to eat.

287
00:19:14.096 --> 00:19:15.630
Okay?

288
00:19:22.038 --> 00:19:23.904
Wait. well...

289
00:19:23.906 --> 00:19:26.943
maybe you can teach me.

290
00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:34.616
Does this look like
a summer camp for rich kids?

291
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:38.052
Look around.

292
00:19:38.054 --> 00:19:40.156
No. not... not exactly.

293
00:19:41.824 --> 00:19:43.991
- Chico.
- Yeah?

294
00:19:43.993 --> 00:19:45.560
I got something for the yucca.

295
00:19:48.864 --> 00:19:50.097
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

296
00:19:50.099 --> 00:19:52.166
I'll give you chili paste.

297
00:19:52.168 --> 00:19:54.734
Malaguetas. man.
Blow your fucking face off.

298
00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.806
You think you got my people
to be on fire. huh?

299
00:19:59.141 --> 00:20:01.175
- Kid!
- What are you doing?

300
00:20:01.177 --> 00:20:03.043
- American-Brooklyn!
- Hey. hey. hey!

301
00:20:03.045 --> 00:20:05.212
Spicy.

302
00:20:05.214 --> 00:20:06.780
What did I say?

303
00:20:06.782 --> 00:20:08.150
Is that sriracha?

304
00:20:09.617 --> 00:20:10.985
Yes. it was.

305
00:20:10.987 --> 00:20:13.220
- It needs lime.
- Yeah.

306
00:20:13.222 --> 00:20:14.556
Hot! Comin' through!

307
00:20:16.926 --> 00:20:18.591
You have somewhere to be?

308
00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:22.863
Oh. um...
Uh. yeah. I'll...

309
00:20:22.865 --> 00:20:24.000
If you don't...

310
00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:31.005
I could use some help.

311
00:20:31.007 --> 00:20:35.976
Come every day during the week
for a few hours.

312
00:20:35.978 --> 00:20:37.344
Help out.

313
00:20:37.346 --> 00:20:39.679
I can teach you a few things.

314
00:20:39.681 --> 00:20:42.016
Really? That'd...
That'd be awesome!

315
00:20:42.018 --> 00:20:44.952
I'm running a tight ship.
Can you handle it?

316
00:20:44.954 --> 00:20:47.021
- Oh. I can! Totally!
- Okay!

317
00:20:47.023 --> 00:20:48.956
- I really appreciate the...
- Okay.

318
00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:50.357
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

319
00:20:50.359 --> 00:20:51.160
- Thank you so much
- You got it?

320
00:20:54.763 --> 00:20:55.697
Mm-mm.

321
00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:01.804
Goodbye.

322
00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:05.372
Bye.

323
00:21:05.374 --> 00:21:06.739
Bye.

324
00:21:06.741 --> 00:21:08.110
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

325
00:21:23.691 --> 00:21:24.858
All right. buddy.
here we are.

326
00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.060
Bye. guys.

327
00:21:26.062 --> 00:21:28.896
Wait a second! Wait. wait.

328
00:21:28.898 --> 00:21:31.865
I won't do this every day.
but I need a hug. I need a hug.

329
00:21:31.867 --> 00:21:34.068
I love you.
Straight home after school.

330
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.003
You know the route.
Subway. two stops.

331
00:21:36.005 --> 00:21:37.404
- Okay.
- Love you. Bye.

332
00:21:37.406 --> 00:21:39.141
Come on. let's go.

333
00:21:40.209 --> 00:21:41.676
Bye!

334
00:22:23.052 --> 00:22:24.885
So where do we start?

335
00:22:24.887 --> 00:22:28.822
Yeah. we start when you
get those dishes washed.

336
00:22:28.824 --> 00:22:30.924
I need this clean.

337
00:22:30.926 --> 00:22:32.725
Right now. come on!
Let's go!

338
00:22:32.727 --> 00:22:34.928
We have a lot to do. you know.

339
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:35.898
Oh. man.

340
00:22:46.942 --> 00:22:47.709
Put it there.

341
00:23:06.162 --> 00:23:07.263
Sorry.

342
00:23:11.967 --> 00:23:13.267
<i>Co-op kitchen. day two.</i>

<i>Sao Paulo meets Harlem prep.</i>

344

<i>And I met lots of flies.

345
00:23:19.808 --> 00:23:20.841

Trash time.

352
00:24:06.922 --> 00:24:08.155
Again?

353
00:24:08.157 --> 00:24:10.324
I thought...

354
00:24:10.326 --> 00:24:12.125
I thought you would
teach me some stuff.

355
00:24:12.127 --> 00:24:13.295
I am.

356
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.530
About working in a kitchen.

357
00:24:16.532 --> 00:24:20.567
You master the basics first.

358
00:24:20.569 --> 00:24:23.470
You need. Okay?

359
00:24:23.472 --> 00:24:25.372
I thought that was like
the basics.

360
00:24:25.374 --> 00:24:26.909
Trash time.

361
00:24:28.277 --> 00:24:30.077
Yo. let's go. let's go!

362
00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:31.245
This too.

363
00:24:31.247 --> 00:24:33.413
We have less than an hour to go!

364
00:24:56.939 --> 00:25:00.374
<i>Got my balls busted these days.</i>

365
00:25:00.376 --> 00:25:02.109
<i>Still better than camp though.</i>

366
00:25:02.111 --> 00:25:04.211
<i>Much better.</i>

367
00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.619
Amen.

368
00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:14.454
Amen.

369
00:25:14.456 --> 00:25:15.524
Amen.

370
00:25:17.426 --> 00:25:19.960
- Can I have some?
- No.

371
00:25:19.962 --> 00:25:20.961
Just a sip.

372
00:25:20.963 --> 00:25:21.995
No!

373
00:25:21.997 --> 00:25:23.463
It's okay.

374
00:25:23.465 --> 00:25:26.533
You give him a little now.

375
00:25:26.535 --> 00:25:28.837
he won't grow up
to be a drunk.

376
00:25:32.074 --> 00:25:33.409
Okay.

377
00:25:35.144 --> 00:25:36.510
L'Chaim.

378
00:25:36.512 --> 00:25:37.880
- L'Chaim.
- L'Chaim.

379
00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:45.285
Okay. That's good.
Take it easy.

380
00:25:45.287 --> 00:25:47.089
- I had a sip!
- God!

381
00:25:49.658 --> 00:25:51.325
It's good.

382
00:25:51.327 --> 00:25:54.094
Sure. okay.
That's enough!

383
00:25:54.096 --> 00:25:55.364
- It smells good.
- Thank you.

384
00:25:57.433 --> 00:25:59.232
Is this all Savta's stuff?

385
00:25:59.234 --> 00:26:01.435
Yeah.

386
00:26:01.437 --> 00:26:04.538
- Oh. nice dress.
- Yeah.

387
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.474
I had a farmer's tan because
we were in Israel that summer.

388
00:26:07.476 --> 00:26:09.411
We're not packing this away.
are we?

389
00:26:13.982 --> 00:26:16.616
Those recipes
are pretty great. right?

390
00:26:16.618 --> 00:26:18.452
Yeah. I love them.

391
00:26:18.454 --> 00:26:21.221
She was such a good cook.

392
00:26:21.223 --> 00:26:23.926
Guess it skipped a generation
and went straight to you.

393
00:26:27.196 --> 00:26:28.362
Take care of those. okay?

394
00:26:28.364 --> 00:26:30.997
I can have these?

395
00:26:30.999 --> 00:26:33.135
I think she'd want you
to have them.

396
00:26:37.005 --> 00:26:39.506
<i>Miss you. Grandma. Really.</i>

397
00:26:39.508 --> 00:26:42.175
<i>I guess people are not handling
your absence very well.</i>

398
00:26:42.177 --> 00:26:43.445
<i>Not at all.</i>

399
00:26:55.324 --> 00:26:57.190
<i>After lots of prep.</i>

400
00:26:57.192 --> 00:26:59.259
<i>it's time to
hit the streets with our food.</i>

401
00:26:59.261 --> 00:27:02.996
<i>I mean. Chico and
Chef Russell Chung's food.</i>

402
00:27:40.302 --> 00:27:42.436
<i>Chico doesn't allow me
to cook yet.</i>

403
00:27:42.438 --> 00:27:44.973
<i>but I'm in charge
of the lemonade.</i>

404
00:27:46.408 --> 00:27:49.242
<i>Okay. just the lemons.</i>

405
00:28:03.492 --> 00:28:04.724
<i>The best lemonade.</i>

406
00:28:04.726 --> 00:28:07.594
<i>Do not waste. Let's freeze.</i>

407
00:28:07.596 --> 00:28:09.429
Thank you. my friend.

408
00:28:09.431 --> 00:28:12.399
All right. here you go. Abe.

409
00:28:12.401 --> 00:28:13.801
That's it!

410
00:28:13.803 --> 00:28:15.535
Thanks.

411
00:28:15.537 --> 00:28:16.705
Oh. wait.

412
00:28:18.574 --> 00:28:20.207
Wait. is this made of pork?

413
00:28:20.209 --> 00:28:22.144
Yeah. why?

414
00:28:23.378 --> 00:28:25.712
Ah.

415
00:28:25.714 --> 00:28:27.581
Abe...

416
00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:31.786
religion. man. it...
it just divides us.

417
00:28:31.788 --> 00:28:34.588
This stuff.
none of it's logical.

418
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.790
None of it makes any sense.

419
00:28:35.792 --> 00:28:38.793
Okay. but. I just...
I think I should...

420
00:28:38.795 --> 00:28:41.428
I don't want you to worry
about any of that stuff. okay?

421
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.832
Hey. you're a great kid.

422
00:28:44.834 --> 00:28:46.368
Just be a great kid.

423
00:28:55.344 --> 00:28:58.478
- Well?
- Mmm.

424
00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.348
There's definitely enough cumin.
It just needs a little salt.

425
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.284
Okay.

426
00:29:04.486 --> 00:29:06.319
Now?

427
00:29:06.321 --> 00:29:07.356
Yeah. that's good.

428
00:29:11.126 --> 00:29:13.326
What is it. habibi?

429
00:29:13.328 --> 00:29:17.497
I didn't fast. so does that mean
I shouldn't eat?

430
00:29:17.499 --> 00:29:21.635
I mean. if iftar means
to break the fast. then...

431
00:29:21.637 --> 00:29:22.870
Of course you can eat.

432
00:29:22.872 --> 00:29:26.506
Everyone can eat at iftar.

433
00:29:26.508 --> 00:29:31.046
And you are 12 now.
You are old enough to fast.

434
00:29:32.548 --> 00:29:34.849
Do you like it? Fasting?

435
00:29:34.851 --> 00:29:36.385
I do.

436
00:29:38.587 --> 00:29:41.187
You know.
it just seems hard to me.

437
00:29:41.189 --> 00:29:44.124
It's supposed to be.

438
00:29:44.126 --> 00:29:48.528
Clears the mind.
connects you with God.

439
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:50.766
And it makes you tough.

440
00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.142
Amen.

441
00:30:08.517 --> 00:30:09.482
This looks great. Mom.

442
00:30:14.256 --> 00:30:17.792
You want something else
to drink. Ibrahim?

443
00:30:17.794 --> 00:30:20.694
Why don't... Why don't
Muslims drink wine?

444
00:30:20.696 --> 00:30:22.729
Wine?

445
00:30:22.731 --> 00:30:25.298
Yeah. I did it at my Shabbat.

446
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.603
And saba says
that I'm old enough.

447
00:30:29.237 --> 00:30:32.505
We do not drink. habibi.
Muslims.

448
00:30:32.507 --> 00:30:33.841
There's no drinking.

449
00:30:33.843 --> 00:30:35.575
What? He does.

450
00:30:35.577 --> 00:30:37.646
I'm not Muslim.

451
00:30:42.284 --> 00:30:45.418
Alcohol dulls the intellect.

452
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.356
Haven't you noticed that
in your father?

453
00:30:50.225 --> 00:30:51.491
This is great.

454
00:30:51.493 --> 00:30:53.662
- This is really. really good.
- Whoa!

455
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.231
Oh!

456
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.204
It is the state department's
definition.

457
00:31:04.206 --> 00:31:08.608
Criticize Israel.
you are anti-Semitic.

458
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.310
I hate this word.

459
00:31:10.312 --> 00:31:11.478
Okay. Mom.

460
00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.513
I am not a Semite.

461
00:31:13.515 --> 00:31:16.282
The Jews. they are anti-Semitic
toward me.

462
00:31:16.284 --> 00:31:19.452
Wait. but doesn't
anti-Semitism mean

463
00:31:19.454 --> 00:31:21.688
you don't like Jewish people?

464
00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:25.826
"Semitic." it refers
to languages.

465
00:31:25.828 --> 00:31:29.229
Hebrew. Arabic. Aramaic.
among others.

466
00:31:29.231 --> 00:31:30.931
There is a family
of Semitic languages

467
00:31:30.933 --> 00:31:33.333
that come from
where we come from.

468
00:31:33.335 --> 00:31:37.907
We belong to language.
and language belongs to us.

469
00:31:39.508 --> 00:31:40.542
Okay.

470
00:32:19.916 --> 00:32:21.581
- Hey. good morning!
- Good morning.

471
00:32:21.583 --> 00:32:23.050
You made it.

472
00:32:23.052 --> 00:32:24.985
I made it strong.

473
00:32:24.987 --> 00:32:26.053
Wow!

474
00:32:26.055 --> 00:32:27.855
Nice! Really good.

475
00:32:27.857 --> 00:32:29.322
- Good.
- Thank you.

476
00:32:29.324 --> 00:32:31.491
How are you today?

477
00:32:31.493 --> 00:32:32.659
Good. You?

478
00:32:32.661 --> 00:32:33.796
I'm good too.

479
00:32:37.532 --> 00:32:41.770
So any trash
I need to take out yet?

480
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:47.041
Do you know
how to use a knife?

481
00:32:47.043 --> 00:32:48.641
Yeah. of course.

482
00:32:48.643 --> 00:32:50.911
Okay. Your turn.

483
00:32:50.913 --> 00:32:53.047
Be careful with your finger.
please.

484
00:32:53.049 --> 00:32:55.918
He'll be fine.
Start from the bottom.

485
00:32:58.888 --> 00:33:01.554
No. no. no!
Come on. come on. easy.

486
00:33:01.556 --> 00:33:02.923
Oh. my God.

487
00:33:02.925 --> 00:33:04.359
- That's all right.
- Sorry.

488
00:33:06.095 --> 00:33:08.028
Follow what I do.

489
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.030
First of all.
you have a base.

490
00:33:10.032 --> 00:33:13.000
you cut it in your hand
and do like that.

491
00:33:13.002 --> 00:33:14.902
Okay.

492
00:33:14.904 --> 00:33:16.603
From the base first.
in your hand.

493
00:33:16.605 --> 00:33:18.873
Yes. exactly.

494
00:33:18.875 --> 00:33:20.074
Just like this.

495
00:33:20.076 --> 00:33:21.809
Like this? I got it.

496
00:33:21.811 --> 00:33:23.880
Yes. Be careful
with your fingers.

497
00:33:25.647 --> 00:33:27.347
- Yes!
- Yes!

498
00:33:27.349 --> 00:33:28.448
- That's really good!
- That's better.

499
00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.818
Go easy and you'll get it.

500
00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:35.355
Are we gonna get to taste any
of this stuff. or are we just...

501
00:33:35.357 --> 00:33:38.458
Okay. do your job first.
then we'll see.

502
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:11.025
<i>After lots of learning
on how to handle garbage...</i>

503
00:34:11.027 --> 00:34:15.029
<i>curses. curses in Portuguese.
like "filho da puta."</i>

504
00:34:15.031 --> 00:34:17.164
<i>washing dishes
and cutting yucca.</i>

505
00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:19.934
<i>I learned that. sometimes.
two plus two equals five.</i>

506
00:34:19.936 --> 00:34:22.435
<i>Or seven.</i>

507
00:34:22.437 --> 00:34:25.806
Draw a map.
A flavor map.

508
00:34:25.808 --> 00:34:28.876
Start by using ingredients
from the same land.

509
00:34:28.878 --> 00:34:31.580
<i>And connect the flavors
to create something unique.</i>

510
00:34:34.016 --> 00:34:36.984
<i>Chico said fusion
is about harmony.</i>

511
00:34:36.986 --> 00:34:38.986
<i>The best part is that
now I have an excuse</i>

512
00:34:38.988 --> 00:34:41.421
<i>to do lots of tasting
and trying.</i>

513
00:34:41.423 --> 00:34:43.556
<i>I need to find things that
match and complete each other.</i>

514
00:34:52.734 --> 00:34:57.037
<i>New dimensions.
like the five basic tastes:</i>

515
00:34:57.039 --> 00:34:58.638
<i>saltiness. sweetness.
bitterness.</i>

516
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.875
<i>sourness and umami.</i>

517
00:35:00.877 --> 00:35:03.576
<i>This last one's only for pros.</i>

518
00:35:03.578 --> 00:35:07.016
<i>Mind map. flavor map.
master flavors.</i>

519
00:35:32.074 --> 00:35:34.609
<i>Great. I'm a recipe of success.</i>

520
00:35:38.014 --> 00:35:40.747
<i>I should see what
a bar mitzvah is like.</i>

521
00:36:11.948 --> 00:36:13.983
Some appetizers for you. guys.

522
00:36:15.251 --> 00:36:17.851
What's this?

523
00:36:17.853 --> 00:36:19.253
Samoa.

524
00:36:19.255 --> 00:36:22.158
Abe. those look good.
Have one.

525
00:36:27.562 --> 00:36:29.263
For your main course.

526
00:36:29.265 --> 00:36:33.000
we have the butternut squash
or the tortellini.

527
00:36:33.002 --> 00:36:35.668
Um. I'll take
the butternut squash.

528
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:36.904
Same for me.

529
00:36:36.906 --> 00:36:39.672
Young man.
mac and cheese or pizza?

530
00:36:39.674 --> 00:36:41.108
Uh. no. thank you.

531
00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.575
Nothing?

532
00:36:42.577 --> 00:36:44.278
No. no. yeah. I'm good.

533
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.048
What's the matter?
You love mac and cheese.

534
00:36:48.117 --> 00:36:49.185
I'm...

535
00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.919
I'm... I'm fasting.

536
00:36:51.921 --> 00:36:53.988
Fasting? Why?

537
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:56.824
I mean. to practice.

538
00:36:56.826 --> 00:36:58.325
For what?

539
00:36:58.327 --> 00:37:00.928
I mean. I....

540
00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.729
It's for Ramadan.

541
00:37:02.731 --> 00:37:04.798
Abe...

542
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.003
Not the right neighborhood.
but it's cool.

543
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:10.039
Okay. Yep.

544
00:37:12.808 --> 00:37:15.109
- Mazel tov!
- Mazel tov!

545
00:37:15.111 --> 00:37:16.642
<i>What's the best place</i>

546
00:37:16.644 --> 00:37:19.246
<i>to accidentally meet
haters of my blog?</i>

547
00:37:19.248 --> 00:37:21.949
<i>Where they belong:
in the toilet.</i>

548
00:37:21.951 --> 00:37:24.018
Dude. I only made
five grand on mine.

549
00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.121
People are only giving me
18 or 36 dollars.

550
00:37:27.123 --> 00:37:28.889
Wait. wait. wait. Because...

551
00:37:28.891 --> 00:37:31.091
If you say any more
sanctimonious bile.

552
00:37:31.093 --> 00:37:33.360
we're gonna go.

553
00:37:33.362 --> 00:37:37.331
Hey. Abe.
I heard you're fasting.

554
00:37:37.333 --> 00:37:41.001
Uh. no. I'm...
My parents told me...

555
00:37:41.003 --> 00:37:43.105
Hey. maybe he has explosives
under there. you think?

556
00:37:45.374 --> 00:37:48.741
All right. how much
did you make at yours?

557
00:37:48.743 --> 00:37:49.843
What do you mean?

558
00:37:49.845 --> 00:37:51.845
You serious?

559
00:37:51.847 --> 00:37:53.280
Your bar mitzvah.

560
00:37:53.282 --> 00:37:55.184
You do it right.
you make a killing.

561
00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:59.019
- Aba.
- What?

562
00:37:59.021 --> 00:38:01.822
Why did you leave Israel?

563
00:38:01.824 --> 00:38:03.290
Our...

564
00:38:03.292 --> 00:38:05.926
Your grandmom...

565
00:38:05.928 --> 00:38:08.761
did not want our daughter
to fight in the army.

566
00:38:08.763 --> 00:38:11.764
I already did that for her.

567
00:38:11.766 --> 00:38:15.069
So then why did you fight.
in the first place?

568
00:38:15.071 --> 00:38:17.838
I always wanted to do my part.

569
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.705
To make sure...

570
00:38:19.707 --> 00:38:22.876
that after thousands of years
of persecution.

571
00:38:22.878 --> 00:38:25.045
that would never happen again.

572
00:38:25.047 --> 00:38:27.047
I always thought of myself

573
00:38:27.049 --> 00:38:32.386
as defending our people
from another holocaust.

574
00:38:32.388 --> 00:38:34.855
Nowadays. with things
out of control.

575
00:38:34.857 --> 00:38:37.391
I'm not always so sure.

576
00:38:37.393 --> 00:38:42.662
Maybe your generation
can find some kind of peace.

577
00:38:42.664 --> 00:38:43.966
Yes?

578
00:38:49.905 --> 00:38:52.039
Did you have a good time?

579
00:38:52.041 --> 00:38:54.009
What did you like?

580
00:38:55.177 --> 00:38:56.178
Um...

581
00:38:59.248 --> 00:39:01.882
- I don't know. It was cool.
- What?

582
00:39:01.884 --> 00:39:04.384
His whole family
was into it. I guess.

583
00:39:04.386 --> 00:39:08.222
Yeah. that is cool.
Yeah. I know.

584
00:39:08.224 --> 00:39:12.392
Gosh. you know.
religion's so complicated.

585
00:39:12.394 --> 00:39:18.165
But sometimes. it can offer
insights into who you are.

586
00:39:18.167 --> 00:39:21.802
You know. the problem is
when it becomes literal.

587
00:39:21.804 --> 00:39:26.240
It's all about these metaphors.
you know?

588
00:39:26.242 --> 00:39:28.909
That stand for big ideas.

589
00:39:28.911 --> 00:39:30.710
What do you mean?

590
00:39:30.712 --> 00:39:34.848
Okay. so let's take heaven.
right?

591
00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:39.486
What if heaven is not
like a literal place you go to.

592
00:39:39.488 --> 00:39:43.723
but maybe an idea.

593
00:39:43.725 --> 00:39:47.327
A metaphor for living your life
lovingly and peacefully

594
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:50.931
right here.
right on Earth. right?

595
00:39:50.933 --> 00:39:53.934
Do you believe that?

596
00:39:53.936 --> 00:39:57.239
It doesn't even matter
what I believe.

597
00:40:03.312 --> 00:40:05.379
We knew this could
come up one day.

598
00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:07.514
It's here. it's in our faces.

599
00:40:07.516 --> 00:40:10.951
This is so not you.
I'm just so surprised by you.

600
00:40:10.953 --> 00:40:13.387
I'm just asking you to be open.

601
00:40:13.389 --> 00:40:15.522
We cannot be
flexible on this.

602
00:40:15.524 --> 00:40:17.757
We have to protect him.

603
00:40:17.759 --> 00:40:19.960
Stop letting him be brainwashed.
"God this. God that."

604
00:40:19.962 --> 00:40:22.264
It's not about God.
It's about his identity.

605
00:40:32.408 --> 00:40:34.141
Sorry you had
to hear that.

606
00:40:34.143 --> 00:40:36.243
- Leave. please.
- Baby...

607
00:40:36.245 --> 00:40:39.046
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do. Mom.

608
00:40:39.048 --> 00:40:40.814
It's like I don't win
in either situation.

609
00:40:40.816 --> 00:40:43.450
If I do anything
from the Muslim side.

610
00:40:43.452 --> 00:40:45.252
then the Jewish side
is gonna be mad.

611
00:40:45.254 --> 00:40:47.354
And if I do anything
from the Jewish side.

612
00:40:47.356 --> 00:40:49.356
then the Muslim side
is gonna be mad.

613
00:40:49.358 --> 00:40:53.927
If I do anything from any side.
then Dad is just gonna be mad.

614
00:40:53.929 --> 00:40:55.896
And if I don't do anything
from either side.

615
00:40:55.898 --> 00:40:58.365
then you're just
gonna be mad.

616
00:40:58.367 --> 00:41:02.002
No one's mad at you. okay?
Just take it easy.

617
00:41:02.004 --> 00:41:04.071
This is all stuff
that we'll figure...

618
00:41:04.073 --> 00:41:06.342
Mom. are you listening to me?

619
00:41:19.088 --> 00:41:21.555
We gotta get this out the door.
Come on. guys.

620
00:41:21.557 --> 00:41:23.390
Get that and get these
in the oven. guys.

621
00:41:23.392 --> 00:41:24.960
Let's go. let's go.

622
00:41:38.907 --> 00:41:41.041
Abe.

623
00:41:41.043 --> 00:41:42.576
What's going on with you today?

624
00:41:42.578 --> 00:41:45.545
You're doing a shitty job. Why?

625
00:41:45.547 --> 00:41:48.181
I'm trying fasting
for Ramadan.

626
00:41:48.183 --> 00:41:49.451
Oh.

627
00:41:54.456 --> 00:41:56.292
A lot coming at you. huh?

628
00:41:58.127 --> 00:41:59.461
I guess.

629
00:42:00.963 --> 00:42:03.864
Well...

630
00:42:03.866 --> 00:42:06.600
you shouldn't cook
when you are in a bad mood.

631
00:42:06.602 --> 00:42:08.535
Why?

632
00:42:08.537 --> 00:42:10.472
Gets in the food.

633
00:42:13.108 --> 00:42:16.845
What about how you're always
cursing and yelling at Mandioca?

634
00:42:18.514 --> 00:42:20.549
Okay. take a break
and get a snack for us.

635
00:42:43.372 --> 00:42:44.971
It's from the leftover lemonade.

636
00:42:44.973 --> 00:42:46.175
You made this?

637
00:42:47.509 --> 00:42:48.975
Yeah.

638
00:42:48.977 --> 00:42:50.477
Hmm.

639
00:42:50.479 --> 00:42:54.047
So try it.
Tell me what you think.

640
00:42:54.049 --> 00:42:56.316
Is that thyme or mint?

641
00:42:56.318 --> 00:42:58.485
Thyme?

642
00:42:58.487 --> 00:42:59.521
Nice.

643
00:43:07.196 --> 00:43:08.195
Is it good?

644
00:43:08.197 --> 00:43:10.630
Oh. yeah.

645
00:43:10.632 --> 00:43:12.999
I could eat popsicles
like all day.

646
00:43:13.001 --> 00:43:14.534
Even in the winter.
I love them.

647
00:43:14.536 --> 00:43:18.071
This reminds me...

648
00:43:18.073 --> 00:43:19.274
my place.

649
00:43:20.442 --> 00:43:24.044
Bahia. Brazil.

650
00:43:24.046 --> 00:43:25.512
We used to be poor.

651
00:43:25.514 --> 00:43:27.614
We did not have
air conditioning like you.

652
00:43:32.187 --> 00:43:33.288
Hot. hot. hot.

653
00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:44.433
Well. Abe. I think you're
ready for the next step.

654
00:43:46.335 --> 00:43:47.469
I'm trusting you.

655
00:43:49.338 --> 00:43:51.071
You better
come on time tomorrow.

656
00:43:51.073 --> 00:43:53.106
Okay. think about
the staff meal.

657
00:43:53.108 --> 00:43:56.410
And opening up the place.
cleaning it up.

658
00:43:56.412 --> 00:43:58.712
and you will get started. okay?

659
00:43:58.714 --> 00:44:01.081
And well done. I like it.

660
00:44:01.083 --> 00:44:03.183
Cool?

661
00:44:03.185 --> 00:44:05.051
Yeah.

662
00:44:05.053 --> 00:44:06.488
Hey.

663
00:44:26.442 --> 00:44:27.741
Teta. can I borrow this?

664
00:44:27.743 --> 00:44:29.743
Yes. of course.

665
00:44:29.745 --> 00:44:32.112
You know. I'm going to
give it to you after I die.

666
00:44:32.114 --> 00:44:33.246
Teta!

667
00:44:33.248 --> 00:44:35.048
That's okay.

668
00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:35.617
Don't talk about that.

669
00:44:37.419 --> 00:44:39.152
Come help me.

670
00:44:39.154 --> 00:44:41.154
Hand me that big piece of lamb
over there.

671
00:44:41.156 --> 00:44:44.024
Oh. my God.
Why there is so much?

672
00:44:44.026 --> 00:44:47.260
We sacrifice a lamb.

673
00:44:47.262 --> 00:44:51.765
Look. we take a third
for ourselves.

674
00:44:51.767 --> 00:44:55.602
a third for the neighbor.
and a third for the poor.

675
00:44:55.604 --> 00:44:58.772
We always share. habibi. always.

676
00:44:58.774 --> 00:45:02.142
I am making this marinade
for shawarma.

677
00:45:02.144 --> 00:45:04.311
You're gonna take
some with you. huh?

678
00:45:04.313 --> 00:45:06.248
Very good.

679
00:45:09.518 --> 00:45:11.151
Wow. That's good.

680
00:45:11.153 --> 00:45:13.653
This is for you. habibi.

681
00:45:13.655 --> 00:45:18.260
You take this. and you make
something delicious. yes?

682
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:20.627
Okay.

683
00:45:20.629 --> 00:45:22.364
Good. Very good.

684
00:45:25.802 --> 00:45:29.102
For the staff meal.

685
00:45:29.104 --> 00:45:30.838
It's shawarma.

686
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.206
And my grandma made
the marinade.

687
00:45:33.208 --> 00:45:34.809
and I think she killed
the lamb too. so it's fresh.

688
00:45:34.811 --> 00:45:37.310
What is in the marinade?
Identify.

689
00:45:37.312 --> 00:45:42.251
Uh. garlic. cinnamon.
coriander...

690
00:45:44.119 --> 00:45:46.119
Definitely vinegar.

691
00:45:46.121 --> 00:45:48.555
Crazy thought.

692
00:45:48.557 --> 00:45:50.058
What if we put it
in a corn tortilla?

693
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.527
Yeah. my friend.

694
00:45:53.529 --> 00:45:57.397
this is the right time
for your taco idea to work.

695
00:45:57.399 --> 00:46:00.166
<i>Co-op kitchen. day 18.</i>

696
00:46:00.168 --> 00:46:01.501
<i>Time to make staff meal.</i>

697
00:46:01.503 --> 00:46:02.602
<i>Big chance.</i>

698
00:46:02.604 --> 00:46:04.740
<i>I really need to make this fly.</i>

699
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:28.461
Ready?

700
00:46:28.463 --> 00:46:29.431
Yup.

701
00:47:01.363 --> 00:47:03.699
- Can I open it now?
- Yeah.

702
00:47:10.372 --> 00:47:11.640
Thank you!

703
00:47:14.242 --> 00:47:16.242
Oh. this is awesome!

704
00:47:16.244 --> 00:47:17.945
So I get to keep this?

705
00:47:17.947 --> 00:47:20.881
Sure! It's yours.
Welcome to the team.

706
00:47:20.883 --> 00:47:23.216
- Yeah!
- Nice. kid!

707
00:47:23.218 --> 00:47:24.618
You're part of the team. bro!

708
00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.553
Yeah!

709
00:48:10.298 --> 00:48:11.832
Do you understand that
this has been going on all...

710
00:48:11.834 --> 00:48:14.001
Babe. babe.
What has happened?

711
00:48:14.003 --> 00:48:16.236
Don't do a thing.
Don't do that.

712
00:48:16.238 --> 00:48:19.506
Do you understand the trouble
you and your facility can be in?

713
00:48:19.508 --> 00:48:21.842
What kind of rules
do you guys set up here?

714
00:48:21.844 --> 00:48:23.710
You have a missing
child in New York City?

715
00:48:23.712 --> 00:48:24.814
- Babe. stop.
- Why?

716
00:48:28.517 --> 00:48:31.317
Get in the car!

717
00:48:31.319 --> 00:48:34.021
Also. do you think
the cost is gonna. you know.

718
00:48:34.023 --> 00:48:37.657
if we move him or how much it
costs. that's a big one.

719
00:48:37.659 --> 00:48:39.359
Well. I'm just saying
it's not getting through to him.

720
00:48:39.361 --> 00:48:41.561
Excuse me!

721
00:48:41.563 --> 00:48:42.899
You know how much trouble
you could have got into. Abe?

722
00:48:44.901 --> 00:48:46.967
- The kitchen. that chef...
- Mom!

723
00:48:46.969 --> 00:48:48.635
Listen to me.
I want you to listen to me.

724
00:48:48.637 --> 00:48:49.636
Respect me for a second.

725
00:48:49.638 --> 00:48:51.538
The kitchen. the chef.

726
00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.339
the guy who was helping you.

727
00:48:53.341 --> 00:48:55.275
they can get in serious trouble

728
00:48:55.277 --> 00:48:57.377
because they hired
an underage child!

729
00:48:57.379 --> 00:48:59.379
It's like training!
He's helping me!

730
00:48:59.381 --> 00:49:01.648
No! I was learning more
with Chico

731
00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:03.683
than I do in one week
in that stupid thing.

732
00:49:03.685 --> 00:49:06.386
Is that who that is? Chico?

733
00:49:06.388 --> 00:49:08.321
- Okay.
- Who is this guy?

734
00:49:08.323 --> 00:49:10.057
- Let's give Chico a call.
- Mom. stop!

735
00:49:10.059 --> 00:49:11.624
- Shh!
- Stop! He was helping me!

736
00:49:11.626 --> 00:49:13.060
Hello. Chico?

737
00:49:13.062 --> 00:49:15.562
Hi. this is Rebecca Solomon Ode.
Abe's Mom.

738
00:49:15.564 --> 00:49:18.431
You're embarrassing me. Mom!
Stop!

739
00:49:18.433 --> 00:49:19.869
- You disappointed me.
- You're so annoying!

740
00:49:22.972 --> 00:49:26.673
- I'm taking this.
- No. No. Dad!

741
00:49:26.675 --> 00:49:29.542
Laptop is done. You'll get this
back when school starts.

742
00:49:29.544 --> 00:49:30.445
You're grounded.

743
00:49:40.722 --> 00:49:43.423
He lied to us. but it's nothing.
It's mumbo-jumbo.

744
00:49:43.425 --> 00:49:46.559
I'm not going to live like this.
Look at me.

745
00:49:46.561 --> 00:49:48.461
- You wanna be the boss?
- Yes.

746
00:49:48.463 --> 00:49:51.598
You can go off in a corner
by yourself and be the boss.

747
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.068
Go along your merry way. but
I'm not gonna live like that.

748
00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:56.036
You know what I'm saying?

749
00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.179
Happy New Year.

750
00:51:12.181 --> 00:51:13.850
Happy Jew Year. Hebes.

751
00:51:19.554 --> 00:51:23.489
Oh. '76. '77.

752
00:51:23.491 --> 00:51:25.125
Really nice stuff.

753
00:51:25.127 --> 00:51:27.694
It's grapey with a taste of...

754
00:51:27.696 --> 00:51:29.464
Is that Creation?

755
00:51:42.477 --> 00:51:43.545
Good.

756
00:51:49.751 --> 00:51:50.619
I do miss her.

757
00:52:05.201 --> 00:52:07.902
<i>I'm back in the game
after a compulsory detox.</i>

758
00:52:07.904 --> 00:52:10.940
<i>I recommend it.
but only if it's your choice.</i>

759
00:52:23.953 --> 00:52:27.254
I don't understand. Why?

760
00:52:27.256 --> 00:52:28.554
Is this because of me?

761
00:52:28.556 --> 00:52:30.623
- Hey. look at me.
- It is.

762
00:52:30.625 --> 00:52:32.226
No. it's not. Look at me.
Look at me.

763
00:52:32.228 --> 00:52:35.628
I promise you
it's not because of you.

764
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.866
Sometimes. um. well.

765
00:52:38.868 --> 00:52:42.535
we think it's best
if we just take a little break.

766
00:52:42.537 --> 00:52:44.204
- A break?
- A break.

767
00:52:44.206 --> 00:52:46.106
- What do you mean. a break?
- Just a little time.

768
00:52:46.108 --> 00:52:47.207
A break from each other.

769
00:52:47.209 --> 00:52:49.045
Why do we need a break?

770
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.880
We're a family.
We're together on this.

771
00:52:52.882 --> 00:52:54.949
Well. your father and I...

772
00:52:54.951 --> 00:52:56.917
It's not because of you. okay?

773
00:52:56.919 --> 00:52:58.052
- Hey. hey.
- No.

774
00:52:58.054 --> 00:52:59.954
Okay. all right.

775
00:52:59.956 --> 00:53:01.656
We love you.

776
00:53:05.962 --> 00:53:08.963
Think of it like this:
You get two Thanksgivings.

777
00:53:08.965 --> 00:53:11.298
One with me and teta.
and jido.

778
00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:14.703
and one with saba
and Ari and your mother.

779
00:55:31.907 --> 00:55:34.074
Cool! Everyone's got
assigned seats?

780
00:55:34.076 --> 00:55:36.376
- Yeah.
- Okay. That's cool.

781
00:55:36.378 --> 00:55:38.078
Are we due?

782
00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.813
- Yeah.
- It's a good idea. right?

783
00:55:39.815 --> 00:55:42.449
It's a great idea.
I love it. I love it.

784
00:55:42.451 --> 00:55:44.418
Everyone's gonna be
so happy. Abe.

785
00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:46.752
I think I see them.

786
00:55:46.754 --> 00:55:48.155
- Sounds like you're sarcastic.
- No. I'm not. I being...

787
00:55:48.157 --> 00:55:49.223
I'm... I'm really...

788
00:55:49.225 --> 00:55:52.725
Uh. this is really thoughtful.

789
00:55:52.727 --> 00:55:53.827
- I hear them.
- Here they are.

790
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:55.331
- Hey!
- Hi. aba.

791
00:55:59.001 --> 00:56:00.903
Please close your eyes.

792
00:56:42.945 --> 00:56:44.411
Cool.

793
00:56:44.413 --> 00:56:45.381
Amen.

794
00:56:49.351 --> 00:56:51.852
- Okay.
- Cool.

795
00:56:51.854 --> 00:56:53.020
Please say Amen.

796
00:56:53.022 --> 00:56:54.154
- Amen.
- Amen.

797
00:56:54.156 --> 00:56:56.792
- Amen.
- Amen.

798
00:57:00.062 --> 00:57:03.197
Hummus and challah.
Sounds like a porno.

799
00:57:03.199 --> 00:57:07.134
Wait! It's a mix of things.
Keep it together.

800
00:57:08.837 --> 00:57:10.306
Mom...

801
00:57:12.241 --> 00:57:16.910
This falafel tastes
just like they do in Israel.

802
00:57:16.912 --> 00:57:19.313
Mm! They do.

803
00:57:19.315 --> 00:57:21.315
Wait. wait. don't get too full.
Purses are coming up.

804
00:57:21.317 --> 00:57:23.417
Purses?

805
00:57:23.419 --> 00:57:27.187
I wouldn't know what
the national snack of Israel

806
00:57:27.189 --> 00:57:29.323
tastes like in Israel.

807
00:57:29.325 --> 00:57:32.459
being that I'm not
permitted in Israel.

808
00:57:37.066 --> 00:57:40.000
Damn. Okay.
Sorry to bring it up.

809
00:57:40.002 --> 00:57:42.071
World War Falafel and shit.

810
00:57:43.539 --> 00:57:46.106
Okay. very hot.
Take one and pass it along.

811
00:57:46.108 --> 00:57:47.374
- Thank you. sweetheart.
- Watch out. it's very hot.

812
00:57:47.376 --> 00:57:48.408
Okay. I got it.

813
00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:50.210
Straight out of the oven.

814
00:57:50.212 --> 00:57:53.480
Egyptians. Syrian. Yemeni.

815
00:57:53.482 --> 00:57:56.283
Jews came to Israel.

816
00:57:56.285 --> 00:57:59.886
and falafel was and is
a part of their culture.

817
00:57:59.888 --> 00:58:01.455
You don't own it.

818
00:58:01.457 --> 00:58:04.057
It's Middle Eastern. regional.

819
00:58:04.059 --> 00:58:07.060
My wife's family in Egypt

820
00:58:07.062 --> 00:58:10.497
was making falafel
for generations.

821
00:58:13.202 --> 00:58:14.901
- Mom.
- Hummus.

822
00:58:14.903 --> 00:58:18.405
Your list conveniently
never mentions the fact

823
00:58:18.407 --> 00:58:21.575
that our food is Palestinian.

824
00:58:21.577 --> 00:58:23.343
You came to our country.
Palestine.

825
00:58:23.345 --> 00:58:27.014
It was hardly a country.

826
00:58:27.016 --> 00:58:28.382
What do you mean?
Of course it was a country!

827
00:58:28.384 --> 00:58:30.384
Salad!

828
00:58:30.386 --> 00:58:32.419
- Salad!
- Yay!

829
00:58:32.421 --> 00:58:34.488
Calling falafel
the national food

830
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:38.625
is another way of how Israel
appropriates our culture.

831
00:58:38.627 --> 00:58:41.895
Food. dance.
even our curse words.

832
00:58:41.897 --> 00:58:44.131
in order to contrive
its own culture

833
00:58:44.133 --> 00:58:46.266
and continue to erase ours.

834
00:58:46.268 --> 00:58:52.239
The families. terrorized by
a decade of brutal genocide.

835
00:58:52.241 --> 00:58:55.442
escaping unimaginable horror.

836
00:58:55.444 --> 00:58:59.946
my own parents
came intentionally

837
00:58:59.948 --> 00:59:02.316
to erase another people

838
00:59:02.318 --> 00:59:05.652
after suffering
their own erasure.

839
00:59:05.654 --> 00:59:09.623
Only a madman
would believe such a thing.

840
00:59:09.625 --> 00:59:11.558
- Ben...
- Can we please...

841
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.327
The house was on fire. Benjamin.

842
00:59:13.329 --> 00:59:16.129
and those who jumped
to save themselves

843
00:59:16.131 --> 00:59:18.432
landed on the people
who were standing below.

844
00:59:18.434 --> 00:59:20.467
The crematorium was on fire.

845
00:59:20.469 --> 00:59:22.436
Hang on.
In this part of the story.

846
00:59:22.438 --> 00:59:25.639
I didn't hear about a fire.

847
00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:28.975
Can we please drop this?

848
00:59:28.977 --> 00:59:33.580
Can we please. for once.
be supportive of him?

849
00:59:33.582 --> 00:59:35.048
Smile a little bit. please.

850
00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:38.285
Here we go. Hey!
Look at that!

851
00:59:38.287 --> 00:59:39.152
- He made that!
- Oh!

852
00:59:39.154 --> 00:59:40.520
Great work. buddy!

853
00:59:40.522 --> 00:59:42.891
That's amazing. isn't it?

854
00:59:45.027 --> 00:59:47.127
That's my boy!
Hey. let me help you carve it.

855
00:59:47.129 --> 00:59:49.029
It's okay.

856
00:59:49.031 --> 00:59:52.332
Don't do that!
Bubbe. don't do that!

857
00:59:52.334 --> 00:59:55.369
Let me help you with this.
It's a little bit...

858
00:59:55.371 --> 00:59:57.604
Abe. Abe!
Abe. no. no. no!

859
00:59:57.606 --> 00:59:59.306
- Listen. listen.
- Dad. I got it.

860
00:59:59.308 --> 01:00:00.707
- Listen to me. listen to me.
- I can do it.

861
01:00:00.709 --> 01:00:03.377
It's not about that.

862
01:00:03.379 --> 01:00:04.611
It's still frozen.

863
01:00:04.613 --> 01:00:07.147
It's okay. It's okay.

864
01:00:07.149 --> 01:00:08.615
Something's coming
out of its booty.

865
01:00:08.617 --> 01:00:09.616
Oh. Fifteen more minutes.

866
01:00:09.618 --> 01:00:11.318
Okay. fifteen more.

867
01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.186
- Fifteen more minutes.
- Guys. guys.

868
01:00:13.188 --> 01:00:15.622
It's a little frozen.
Let it go. let it go.

869
01:00:15.624 --> 01:00:19.025
Mom!

870
01:00:19.027 --> 01:00:20.293
- I should help.
- Mom!

871
01:00:20.295 --> 01:00:21.728
Please sit down!

872
01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:23.263
Can you please sit down?

873
01:00:23.265 --> 01:00:26.032
- Aida.
- Thank you.

874
01:00:26.034 --> 01:00:29.002
It's important for him
that he do this alone.

875
01:00:29.004 --> 01:00:30.070
Do you understand?

876
01:00:30.072 --> 01:00:31.505
I think he could use a hand.

877
01:00:31.507 --> 01:00:33.073
If he needs a hand.
he can ask us.

878
01:00:33.075 --> 01:00:34.574
This is your parenting method?

879
01:00:34.576 --> 01:00:36.578
Leave him to do
whatever he wants?

880
01:00:38.247 --> 01:00:41.348
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

881
01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:44.551
No one is looking after him.
No one.

882
01:00:44.553 --> 01:00:47.120
We are looking after him.

883
01:00:47.122 --> 01:00:48.488
Oh. really?

884
01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:50.457
Yes. really.

885
01:00:50.459 --> 01:00:55.262
Where were you when he went
to work with a stranger. hmm?

886
01:00:55.264 --> 01:00:57.230
- Come on.
- Yeah!

887
01:00:57.232 --> 01:01:00.100
Or when he pretended
to be in the camp?

888
01:01:00.102 --> 01:01:01.401
- Were you right here?
- Now is not the time.

889
01:01:01.403 --> 01:01:03.370
Now is the time!

890
01:01:03.372 --> 01:01:06.440
I kept my mouth shut
long enough.

891
01:01:06.442 --> 01:01:08.208
When have you ever
kept your mouth shut?

892
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:10.677
Mom. enough.

893
01:01:10.679 --> 01:01:12.379
What if something
had happened?

894
01:01:12.381 --> 01:01:14.147
Nothing happened to him.

895
01:01:14.149 --> 01:01:16.149
No one wants to say it. huh?

896
01:01:16.151 --> 01:01:19.019
What if he had gotten
kidnapped or worse?

897
01:01:19.021 --> 01:01:22.122
Mom. I'm asking you nicely
to please end this!

898
01:01:23.258 --> 01:01:28.161
Your... Your mother is right.

899
01:01:28.163 --> 01:01:30.599
Your child is lost.

900
01:01:33.602 --> 01:01:36.436
- He's not lost.
- Actually. Ben. you're right.

901
01:01:36.438 --> 01:01:38.338
He is lost.
You know why he's lost?

902
01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:43.310
Because you have manipulated him
with your religion

903
01:01:43.312 --> 01:01:46.179
and your God
and your bullshit. Mom!

904
01:01:46.181 --> 01:01:48.482
Sit down!
Sit down now!

905
01:01:48.484 --> 01:01:50.183
What did you expect. Rebecca?

906
01:01:50.185 --> 01:01:52.787
You married against
everyone's advice.

907
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:55.455
knowing there would be
problems!

908
01:01:55.457 --> 01:01:59.125
We're gonna talk about that now.
15 years into it?

909
01:01:59.127 --> 01:02:01.761
Why are you saying this now?
How dare you!

910
01:02:01.763 --> 01:02:04.631
We feel sorry for him.
It is not fair!

911
01:02:04.633 --> 01:02:08.435
Not. not. not fair.
It was a mistake!

912
01:02:08.437 --> 01:02:13.607
Bringing a child
into your messy lives!

913
01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:16.176
He is saying
what needs to me said!

914
01:02:16.178 --> 01:02:18.478
- No. it is not the time!
- I'm sorry. I...

915
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.347
We should be ashamed!

916
01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:22.282
That's what you're gonna
talk about now.

917
01:02:22.284 --> 01:02:24.284
fifteen years after the fact.

918
01:02:24.286 --> 01:02:27.120
Mom. why don't you go over there
in the corner

919
01:02:27.122 --> 01:02:28.856
and sulk over there.
please. right now?

920
01:02:28.858 --> 01:02:30.590
- Selfish!
- Careful. Ben.

921
01:03:00.188 --> 01:03:01.755
Do you understand
or do you not care?

922
01:03:01.757 --> 01:03:02.689
I want you all
to leave my house.

923
01:03:02.691 --> 01:03:04.226
- Shit.
- What?

924
01:03:05.727 --> 01:03:07.095
What?

925
01:03:08.798 --> 01:03:09.797
What?

926
01:03:09.799 --> 01:03:10.732
He left it in the oven.

927
01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.167
Where is Abe?

928
01:03:14.169 --> 01:03:15.402
Abe!

929
01:03:15.404 --> 01:03:17.337
See? Are you happy now? Abe!

930
01:03:17.339 --> 01:03:18.672
Abraham!

931
01:03:18.674 --> 01:03:20.273
- Ibrahim.
- Abraham!

932
01:03:20.275 --> 01:03:22.309
He's probably upstairs.
Calm down. please.

933
01:03:22.311 --> 01:03:24.244
Abe!

934
01:03:24.246 --> 01:03:25.747
Come down here. buddy.
We're done arguing!

935
01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:54.775
- Avi!
- Abe!

936
01:03:54.777 --> 01:03:57.112
Ibrahim!

937
01:04:03.418 --> 01:04:05.320
Ibrahim!

938
01:04:12.327 --> 01:04:13.662
Ibrahim!

939
01:04:16.398 --> 01:04:17.699
Avi!

940
01:04:24.807 --> 01:04:26.375
Avi!

941
01:04:48.798 --> 01:04:51.765
Avi. it's Mama. Just...

942
01:04:51.767 --> 01:04:53.934
Now we're getting
a little worried.

943
01:04:53.936 --> 01:04:55.905
So why don't you pick up
the phone. bubbe. okay?

944
01:05:04.914 --> 01:05:06.914
Should we call the police?

945
01:05:06.916 --> 01:05:11.553
No. No! Oh. God.

946
01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:20.863
He couldn't have gone far.

947
01:05:22.731 --> 01:05:23.596
I'll drive around.

948
01:05:23.598 --> 01:05:24.867
I'll come with you.

949
01:05:42.584 --> 01:05:43.886
Is for you.

950
01:05:46.388 --> 01:05:47.890
Anything?

951
01:05:55.865 --> 01:05:58.899
I don't know what to do.

952
01:05:58.901 --> 01:06:01.470
It's okay.

953
01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:07.910
There is no guidebook
to be a parent.

954
01:06:10.847 --> 01:06:12.782
Hard to be one.

955
01:06:14.382 --> 01:06:15.918
And hard to lose one.

956
01:06:18.821 --> 01:06:20.957
He will come home. habibi.

957
01:06:29.698 --> 01:06:31.600
Thank you.

958
01:06:47.884 --> 01:06:49.484
I'm losing steam.
I can't see straight.

959
01:07:05.902 --> 01:07:08.871
You should eat something.

960
01:07:10.572 --> 01:07:11.941
I can't right now.

961
01:07:14.777 --> 01:07:16.411
Keep your strength up.

962
01:07:25.054 --> 01:07:26.388
Dad?

963
01:07:29.724 --> 01:07:31.558
Amir.

964
01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.761
Come.

965
01:07:39.534 --> 01:07:40.669
You eat.

966
01:07:52.447 --> 01:07:54.114
I'm sorry.

967
01:07:54.116 --> 01:07:59.021
No. I am sorry for my part
in all this.

968
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:04.792
If I hurt you or him.

969
01:08:04.794 --> 01:08:07.660
I wish I could...

970
01:08:07.662 --> 01:08:09.866
take back everything I said.

971
01:08:13.535 --> 01:08:16.906
We all said things
that we shouldn't have. okay?

972
01:08:40.196 --> 01:08:41.563
Okay.

973
01:09:25.908 --> 01:09:27.475
We'll find him.

974
01:09:56.973 --> 01:09:58.174
Good.

975
01:10:00.076 --> 01:10:02.209
Very good.

976
01:10:02.211 --> 01:10:04.146
He's a good cook.

977
01:10:06.949 --> 01:10:09.116
Hey. have you guys seen this?

978
01:10:09.118 --> 01:10:10.918
What?

979
01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.154
Abe's on Instagram.
I didn't realize. Yeah.

980
01:10:14.156 --> 01:10:15.956
What is... What?

981
01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:18.025
It's the meal from tonight.

982
01:10:18.027 --> 01:10:20.294
What are you saying?
Is it the meal?

983
01:10:20.296 --> 01:10:22.096
What is Instagram?

984
01:10:22.098 --> 01:10:24.630
So. okay.

985
01:10:24.632 --> 01:10:27.234
It's a picture
from this meal tonight.

986
01:10:27.236 --> 01:10:28.268
He puts on the web.

987
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:29.669
So you're saying he's...

988
01:10:29.671 --> 01:10:31.805
He's somewhere putting pictures.

989
01:10:31.807 --> 01:10:33.273
We'll be back. We'll be back.

990
01:10:33.275 --> 01:10:34.975
- Where are you going?
- We'll be back.

991
01:10:34.977 --> 01:10:37.111
That's my cell phone.

992
01:10:37.113 --> 01:10:38.180
Okay.

993
01:10:55.364 --> 01:10:57.199
Hey. brother.

994
01:10:58.633 --> 01:10:59.935
Hey. Sorry.

995
01:11:02.171 --> 01:11:03.772
Your folks are on the way.

996
01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:09.176
I tried to make it right.

997
01:11:09.178 --> 01:11:11.345
I tried to mix the foods and...

998
01:11:11.347 --> 01:11:14.083
and bring them together.
just like you showed me.

999
01:11:18.921 --> 01:11:21.188
But I messed it up.

1000
01:11:21.190 --> 01:11:22.925
I just...
I messed everything up.

1001
01:11:25.727 --> 01:11:28.896
They fought and fought
and fought and yelled.

1002
01:11:28.898 --> 01:11:31.398
and they just yelled.

1003
01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.869
I mean. I think I just
made everything worse.

1004
01:11:35.871 --> 01:11:38.140
Look. Abe.

1005
01:11:43.045 --> 01:11:46.413
You can't run away
from your problems.

1006
01:11:46.415 --> 01:11:49.383
You need to face it.

1007
01:11:49.385 --> 01:11:54.023
Sometimes people are not
going to come together.

1008
01:11:55.391 --> 01:11:57.226
Just be yourself.

1009
01:11:58.794 --> 01:11:59.328
Abe?

1010
01:12:01.363 --> 01:12:02.298
Abe!

1011
01:12:03.966 --> 01:12:05.968
It's all right.
It's all right.

1012
01:12:08.703 --> 01:12:10.106
Hi.

1013
01:12:14.877 --> 01:12:17.344
I'll give you some space. okay?

1014
01:12:17.346 --> 01:12:18.347
Thank you.

1015
01:12:24.453 --> 01:12:25.687
It's okay.

1020

1021
01:14:26.108 --> 01:14:27.376
Would you like a taco?

1022
01:14:46.962 --> 01:14:48.428
This is great.

1023
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:50.163
What's in here?

1024
01:14:50.165 --> 01:14:52.032
Popsicles.

1025
01:14:52.034 --> 01:14:53.934
Who is the chef?

1026
01:14:53.936 --> 01:14:55.838
Chico. Yes. the tallest.

1027
01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.206
What are these seeds in here?

1028
01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:00.574
They're hemp seeds.

1029
01:15:00.576 --> 01:15:04.044
There they are. Hey!

1030
01:15:04.046 --> 01:15:05.512
Yay!

1031
01:15:05.514 --> 01:15:09.149
Fruit punch and dragon fruit.

1032
01:15:09.151 --> 01:15:10.917
It tastes really good.

1033
01:15:10.919 --> 01:15:12.821
You look so cute in your apron.
Let me see.

1034
01:15:16.592 --> 01:15:18.925
Hey. are these are hemp seeds
in here?

1035
01:15:18.927 --> 01:15:19.993
Yep.

1036
01:15:19.995 --> 01:15:21.928
I thought hemp. you wore hemp.

1037
01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:24.031
I thought you smoked hemp.

1038
01:15:24.033 --> 01:15:26.133
Did you know that
every ingredient you used

1039
01:15:26.135 --> 01:15:27.901
is originally from...

1040
01:15:27.903 --> 01:15:29.236
- Abe said not today.
- Not right now.

1041
01:15:29.238 --> 01:15:30.871
- Is it kosher?
- Dad!

1042
01:15:30.873 --> 01:15:33.373
I tried an edible popsicle
last year.

1043
01:15:33.375 --> 01:15:35.642
I ate the whole thing at once.

1044
01:15:35.644 --> 01:15:37.110
Totally blacked out!

1045
01:15:37.112 --> 01:15:38.047
Oh. really?

1046
01:15:40.349 --> 01:15:41.648
