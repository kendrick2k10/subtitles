00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:26.693
{\an8}- Okay. okay.
That's enough of that. - (music slows. stops)

6
00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.403
Hello. loyal viewers!

7
00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:32.282
Like me. you probably never
thought this day would come.

8
00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:35.368
I see some old friends.
I see new friends.

9
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.163
{\an8}I see friends who frankly
should put some pants on

10
00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.789
{\an8}and venture outside
occasionally.

11
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.083
Seriously. get some sun!

12
00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.586
But. for those who
are just joining us.

13
00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:47.464
here's a little something
to catch you up in the form

14
00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:51.926
of my incredibly exciting
superhero origin story!

15
00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.136
- (beeps)
- (exciting music playing)

16
00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:55.680
Metrocity.
a city full of danger.

17
00:00:55.722 --> 00:01:00.185
and only Metro Man was strong
enough to defend it from evil.

18
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:03.897
- Until I totally
kicked his butt! - (zap)

19
00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.358
(explosion blasts)

20
00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.985
- That's me. Megamind.
- (dance music playing)

21
00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:11.279
Incredibly handsome
criminal genius

22
00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:14.115
and master of all villainy.

23
00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:18.495
But without a hero to fight.
I felt lonely.

24
00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:22.916
So I created a new superhero
to play with named Titan.

25
00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:26.711
Unfortunately. he was a worse
villain than I ever was.

26
00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:29.756
(stone crashing)

27
00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.258
It was then that I realized

28
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.761
my destiny was not
to be a supervillain.

29
00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:37.430
but a superhero.

30
00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:41.101
- I defeated Titan
and saved the day. - (whirring)

31
00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:43.395
(triumphant music playing)

32
00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:47.023
I became Megamind.
defender of Metrocity.

33
00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:48.983
- (crowd cheering)
- But little did I know.

34
00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:52.278
my greatest challenge
was yet to come.

35
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.156
(dramatic crescendo)

36
00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:58.451
(soft music playing)

37
00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:02.247
(gurgling)

38
00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.124
Blue Mackerel: You're in
my personal space. bro.

39
00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:06.251
Red Snapper: Oh. well.
excuse me for swimming!

40
00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.545
I don't think that
was a sincere apology!

41
00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.880
- It's not!
- Big King Fish: Both of you. clam up!

42
00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.173
(bang)

43
00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:14.467
We got work to do.

44
00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.345
- (intense music playing)
- Go fish.

45
00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.353
(tapping)

46
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.647
Here goes.

47
00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.191
- (yelling. laughing)
- (reels unspooling)

48
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.611
(grunting)

49
00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.196
(reels spooling)

50
00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.323
There it is.

51
00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:40.910
- (jewels sparkling)
- (laughs) Catch of the day.

52
00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.916
- (glass cracking)
- (water rushing)

53
00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:51.004
Ooh. this little baby's
gonna be worth a fortune

54
00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:52.839
on the black fish market!

55
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.049
(Megamind laughs)

56
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.760
(rock music playing)

57
00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:59.846
(whirring. beeping)

58
00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.808
You'd think with all
the time you guys spent

59
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.603
swimming in "shools."
you'd be smarter.

60
00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.021
The Go Fish Gang:
Megamind?!

61
00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.148
I knew it was only
a matter of time

62
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.025
before the Go Fish Gang
tried to steal

63
00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:13.276
the diamond-encrusted koi

64
00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.862
on loan from
the Beijing Water Palace.

65
00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.447
It's something the old evil me

66
00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.407
would've done (laughs)
way back in the day.

67
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.869
Sir. "way back in the day"
was just two days ago.

68
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:26.206
That's all? Time certainly drags
when you're a good guy.

69
00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.083
Minion.
how could you possibly serve

70
00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.001
a bad guy who's turned hero?

71
00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.586
Quick correction there.

72
00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.881
Due to a cease-and-desist order
from popular fast food chain

73
00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.383
Mr. Minion's Meat-sicles.

74
00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:38.510
I can no longer
call myself Minion.

75
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.512
So. Megamind gave me
a new name.

76
00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:43.390
Ol' Chum.
It means. "old friend."

77
00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:44.808
(sentimental music playing)

78
00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.394
Yeah. well. chum also
means something else.

79
00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.229
- Shark bait!
- (dramatic sting)

80
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.647
(glass cracking)

81
00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.483
Wait. chum means "shark bait"?

82
00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.318
Why. yes! Sharks love bait!

83
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.986
It's a term of endearment.

84
00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.029
- Aw!
- (gasps)

85
00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.864
- (glass shatters)
- (shark roars)

86
00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.909
It looks like we're both
about to be shark bait!

87
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.411
- Not for long.
- (zaps)

88
00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:07.330
(triumphant music playing)

89
00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.249
- (clanking)
- (Chum sighs)

90
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.459
Apex predators are
a whole lot cuter

91
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.961
when you can put
them in your pocket.

92
00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.921

That oughta hold you

- Chum. this is
beyond embarrassing! - (fizzling)

104
00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.318
Sorry. sir.

105
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.321
Hey. Megamind! Your gadgets
are like the Titanic.

106
00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:41.823
a total disaster!

107
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.658
- (Go Fish Gang laugh)
- Megamind: How dare you!

108
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.411
The Titanic was a delight
for most of the journey.

109
00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.121
After them!

110
00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.789
(dramatic music playing)

111
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.499

You were great villains.

119

but as heroes.
you guys are all wet!

120
00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.937
Let's finish them off!

Water in the hole!

Oh. right! I'm a hero now.

No more puns.

Aren't you forgetting
another defender. sir?

Don't think so.

163
00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.081
You didn't. by chance.
forget about someone who.

164
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:58.168
I don't know. say.
gallantly fought by your side?

I have possibly forgotten?

That short-out was
a little embarrassing.

Remember. I have a super
heroic image to maintain.

But now. villains.

Metro Man's radar.

So far. our new blue hero
seems up to the task.

178
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:35.872
And while many changes
are afoot in Metro City.

179
00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:39.876
the one constant is me.
Roxanne Ritchi.

180
00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:43.171
reporting on
the accomplishments of others.

181
00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:45.548
- Huh. Honestly.
how did that sound? - (camera beeps)

182
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.343
Child:
Like you just realized you've lost all interest in your job.

183
00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:50.095
and you're going through
the motions.

184
00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.846
Other than that. slam dunk!

185
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.140
- And you are?
- Keiko Morita.

186
00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.476
president of Megamind's
number-one streaming online

187
00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:57.894
fan club MegaWatch.

188
00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.146
covering all things blue
and super-heroic in Metro City.

189
00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:04.150
- Um... okay.
- Have time for a few questions?

190
00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:05.985
What is happening right now?

191
00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:08.363
Roxanne Ritchi.
you just helped Megamind

192
00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:09.698
save the city from Titan.

193
00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:11.533
So what's your
awesome next step?

194
00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.536
Next step?
A-And are you recording this?

195
00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.705
Don't worry. it's great!

196
00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.165
Obviously. you're too cool
to be just on television.

197
00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:21.668
You're a shark.
You have to keep moving. girl!

198
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.380
- You gotta have a side hustle!
- You're not wrong.

199
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.174
I don't know.
Reporting is important.

200
00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:30.760
but Megamind has been
a hero for only a few days.

201
00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:33.555
and he's already making
a big difference in this city.

202
00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.473
Can't help thinking
maybe there's a way

203
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.559
I can be doing more. too.

204
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.354
Wait. why am I telling you
this? How old are you again?

205
00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.106
- You first.
- Touché.

206
00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.734
What you need to do is find
the thing you wanna do

207
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.736
and go for it.
Look at me!

208
00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.362
A few weeks ago.
I was a middle schooler

209
00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:50.864
sitting in detention. Now.

210
00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.658
I'm streaming a show with
a half-million subscribers.

211
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.994
Did you say half million?

212
00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.787
That's like
10 times my audience.

213
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:59.456
- not counting family and pets.
- Keiko Morita: Gotta go.

214
00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.208
Wanna get a better shot of
the ceremony before it starts.

215
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.587
- Good talk though.
- Yeah! Good talk. (laughs)

216
00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.255
Half million...

217
00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:11.885
For his ongoing heroic actions
as Metro's defender.

218
00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:15.472
- I award Megamind
the key to our fair city. - (crowd cheering)

219
00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:18.850
- (laughs) I-I mean.
why not. right? (laughs) - (Megamind laughing)

220
00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.102
- Crowd: Megamind! Megamind!
- Thank you. thank you.

221
00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:22.979
You're very kind.

222
00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.647
- (grunting)
- (key clangs)

223
00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.733
(struggling)

224
00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.151
(Chum laughing)

225
00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:31.654
Chum. be a good assistant
and deal with this for me.

226
00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.908
- (clangs. clatters)
- Whoa!

227
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:37.869
(clears throat)
Been getting some feedback

228
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:41.623
that some of my speeches have
been running a little long.

229
00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.667
- so I cut this one down...
- (paper rattling)

230
00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.335
...to step length.

231
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.755
Since the dawn of time.

232
00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:51.925
man has been dealing
with good versus evil.

233
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.220
Hey. Chum.
How's the new hero gig going?

234
00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.098
Everything's changed for him.

235
00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:01.267
- Me. not so much.
- I know what you mean.

236
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:02.811
I thought I was more to him.

237
00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:05.480
I thought I was
like his sidekick.

238
00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.607
But he still just
sees me as the minion

239
00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:11.027
who fixes his brainbots
and washes his socks.

240
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:14.030
You know. someone
very recently told me.

241
00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:16.366
if you know what you want.
go for it.

242
00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:20.453
So. tell Megamind you want
a promotion to sidekick.

243
00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:22.163
Oh. it's not
a minion's place to--

244
00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.249
Roxanne Ritchi:
But you're not a minion.

245
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.750
You're more than that.

246
00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.419
Maybe you just need
to remind him

247
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.462
how valuable you really are.

248
00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.131
Speak from the heart.

249
00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.341
- (hopeful music playing)
- You're right.

250
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.635
I need to speak from the heart.

251
00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:38.430
And that's why
you're all so lucky

252
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:42.058
- to have me as your hero.
- (applause. cheering)

253
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.727
Megamind out!

254
00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:47.355
Uh! Excuse me!
(panting) Megamind?

255
00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:50.066
I'm Keiko Morita.
president of your fan club.

256
00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:53.111
President?
Oh. I have nothing but respect

257
00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:55.655
- for those who assume power.
- Then you'll love this.

258
00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.323
I'm also your new
social media manager.

259
00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:59.617
streaming content creator.
and image consultant.

260
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.995
Those are a lot of words
I don't understand.

261
00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:03.747
Whoa! Is that
the disguise generator?

262
00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.790
- Can I try it?
- Don't touch that!

263
00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.293
It's a highly sophisticated
electronic device.

264
00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.670
It's cool! My generation
was born tech-savvy.

265
00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:14.174
Really? Then I suppose this is
one of those smarty-pants phones

266
00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:16.009
with a calculator
built right in.

267
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.678
Okay. wow. That proves
you really need my help.

268
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.722
You were threatening
the city a few days ago.

269
00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.098
Now you're defending it!

270
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.809
People wanna know who
the new heroic Megamind is!

271
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.895
I'll help you show them.

272
00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.229
You have a lot of energy.

273
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:30.357
Did you just consume
a pound of sugar?

274
00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.941
Nope!
I'm like this naturally!

275
00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:33.902
Must be exhausting.

276
00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.529
I wanna be a crime fighter
just like you.

277
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:37.989
You know. part of the team.

278
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.367
(sighs) Here's the thing.

279
00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:41.951
I don't do teams.

280
00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:43.620
I'm more of a solo act.

281
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.373
but you're adorable
in a pushy sort of way.

282
00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.166
So. here's a souvenir.

283
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:51.044
It's either a paperweight
or a flash grenade.

284
00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:54.339
I can't remember which.
so careful with that.

285
00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:56.257
He'll come around.

286
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.094
Here he comes. You ready?

287
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.220
Oh. absolutely!

288
00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.514
Had the brainbots
program an algorithm

289
00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:05.225
for a surefire
negotiation speech.

290
00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:07.769
Not what I meant by
speaking from the heart.

291
00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:11.231
Ah. there you are. Chum.
Let's head back to the lair.

292
00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.233
Those socks aren't
gonna wash themselves.

293
00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:15.443
- (beeps)
- (motivational music playing)

294
00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.570
(Chum clears throat)

295
00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:19.489
Good afternoon!

296
00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:21.533
Do you aspire for success?

297
00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.742
I bet you do.

298
00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:26.204
Well. insert boss' name here.
while I humbly appreciate

299
00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.331
the opportunities
you've given me.

300
00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:31.626
since we've altered the mission
statement of our organization.

301
00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.753
I'm confident
I could achieve more.

302
00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.839
I believe I have made

303
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.591
significant contributions
to the new paradigm

304
00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:40.885
and wish for
positional advancement

305
00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.596
befitting my more than
adequate executions

306
00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.891
of said opportunities.

307
00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.560
- (beeps)
- (music stops)

308
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.355
Chum. you're talking gibberish.

309
00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.649
Might be time to change
your bowl water again.

310
00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:58.153
Uh. what I'm trying to ask.
uh...

311
00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:01.614
Chum wants a promotion!
He wants to be your sidekick.

312
00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.492
Sidekick?
That's a big change.

313
00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.954
I don't think you've thought
through this. old friend.

314
00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:10.915
We've got a dynamic here.
I'm the hero.

315
00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.293
You're the guy who gets
to hang out with the hero.

316
00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.587
Now. with that
firmly reestablished.

317
00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.506
let's go get some churros.

318
00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:20.008
(clears throat loudly)

319
00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:23.303
Sir. if you don't
recognize my contributions.

320
00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:27.349
maybe it's time for me to
explore other opportunities.

321
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.309
Hm. Okay.

322
00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:33.188
- Well. if you feel that
strongly about it... - Oh.

323
00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:34.773
Okay then. Uh...

324
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:38.151
If you feel that strongly about
me feeling strongly about it--

325
00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:41.196
I feel strongly about
you feeling strongly

326
00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.865
that I feel strongly about
you feeling strongly.

327
00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:46.910
Okay. we get it!
Everyone's feeling strongly.

328
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:50.330
No. Roxanne!
Who am I to clip Chum's wings?

329
00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:53.833
I say fly.
you magnificent dove.

330
00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:56.503
(sighs) Yes. I will fly.

331
00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:00.382
I thank you for all
the good times we had.

332
00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.886
We part now on friendly terms.

333
00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:10.475
- (Chum's suit whirring)
- (emotional music playing)

334
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.688
I'll be a monkey's uncle!

335
00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.564
He's really
walking away this time!

336
00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:19.818
- I don't believe you.
- It's just a figure of speech.

337
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.486
I'm not really
a monkey's uncle.

338
00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:25.031
I mean. I can't believe
you just let him quit!

339
00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:28.326
Relax.
It's a negotiation tactic.

340
00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.036
Like the time he went
on a hunger strike

341
00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:31.913
because he wanted
a pet parakeet.

342
00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:33.123
What did you do then?

343
00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:35.583
I waited him out
until he finally gave in.

344
00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:37.877
Parakeets are poop machines.

345
00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:40.380
(sighs)
Everything is changing so fast.

346
00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:44.467
Sometimes. I miss the simplicity

villain name ever! (laughs)

376
00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:55.663
Why did you change it
from Fright Night?

377
00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.499
That was so much better.

378
00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.501
Lord Nighty-Knight:
What are you talking about? It's Nighty-Knight.

379

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.685
{\an8}just got himself a new gig.

386
00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.061
{\an8}Anchor (on TV):
Breaking news.

387
00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:19.729

the key to the city

388

VILLAINS:
No way!

390
00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:25.819
As leader. I've decided

391
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.488
it's time to pay
Megamind a visit.

392
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.906
Say what?!

393
00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:31.783
Behemoth leader!

394
00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.244
You are not ze leader!
It is moi!

395
00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:37.497
Nighty-Knight:
No. Megamind gave me his darkest blessing.

396
00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:40.333
Raise your hand
if you also think

397
00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.127
Megamind left you in charge.

398
00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:43.461
Pierre Pressure:
I do!

399
00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:44.879
Ugh. seriously?!

400
00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:48.633
How many leaders think
we should pay Megamind a visit?

401
00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:50.135
Pierre:
I do!

402
00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:51.469
Fine. It's settled then.

403
00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:55.056
I agree. But. there is
just one little thing

404
00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:56.808
to take care of first.

405
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.268
(buzzer blares)

406
00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:00.729
Guard:
Hey. Doomy Glooms! No scheming during lunch!

407
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.606
This was a nice place
to lay low for a while.

408
00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:06.359
but we've got some
business to take care of.

409
00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:09.362
Nighty-Knight:
Hello darkness. my old friend.

410
00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:11.072

411
00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:12.574

I can't move!

415
00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:20.373

417
00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:26.212
if you are trapped
in an invisible box.

418
00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:30.091
Help! I'm trapped
in an invisible box!

419
00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:32.844
(alarm blaring)

420
00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:33.887
(doors slam)

421
00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:35.555
Behemoth? Go gravel.

422
00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:37.140
(growls. roars)

423
00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:39.392

424
00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:40.727

Guard:
Oh. please don't hurt me!

431
00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:54.908

Megamind. here we come.

435
00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.501
(dramatic crescendo)

436
00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:08.672
Spokesman (on radio):
Ever feel like you're driving to the same job.

437
00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.006
drinking the same coffee.

438
00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:12.676
wearing the same outfit
almost every day?

439
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:15.261
- Ugh. Yeah.
- Spokesman: Have you been wondering

440
00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.347
if there's more
you could be doing

441
00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:19.099

445
00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:27.357
Okay. that really
under-delivered.

- (whirring)
- How are you doing this?!

450
00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:38.368
Through the bobblehead of myself
I gave to you as a present.

451
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.620
It's a tracking device
so I can look out for you.

452
00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:44.040
{\an8}I'm flattered by this
invasion of my privacy.

453
00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:47.752
{\an8}Come to the lair immediately.
My very life may depend on it!

454
00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:50.296
{\an8}Hang on!
I'll be right there.

455
00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:54.426
- (tires squeal)
- (horns honking)

456
00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:58.138

- (Megamind screams)

458
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.017
Megamind?

459
00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:04.310
Megamind:
I'm in the kitchen! Hurry!

460
00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:06.563
- (doors creak)
- (Megamind struggling)

461

- Roxanne: What is happening?

462
00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:12.193
I'll tell you what's happening!

463
00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:16.197
This disrespectful toaster
pastry refuses to toast!

464
00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:18.700
I thought this was
a matter of life and death!

465
00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:21.745
Newsflash! I need food.
or I'll starve.

466
00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.913
Besides. I couldn't
reach the pancakes.

467
00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.290
(splats)

468
00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:28.168
Newsflash!
Toasters need to be plugged in

469
00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.502
or they won't work.

470
00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:33.089
(gasps) Show me what you did.
sorceress!

471
00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:36.343
(sighs)
Maybe you should call Chum?

472
00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:39.387
I'm fully capable of
taking care of myself.

473
00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:42.724
One question. How does one go
about taking care of oneself?

474
00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:45.018
- (alarm blaring)
- The intruder alert!

475
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.186
Thank goodness.

476
00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:48.480
- Isn't that bad?
- It's Chum.

477
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:49.939
He's always setting that off.

478
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:53.360
Looks like someone couldn't
bear to be without me.

479
00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:55.653
(splats)

480
00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.865
Well. well. Look who
finally decided to--

481
00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:01.618
- Ah!
- Lady Doppler: Come on. Megamind.

482
00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:04.287
Is that any way to
welcome your old crew?

483
00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:08.416
I mean...
what an unpleasant surprise!

484
00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:10.877
My old evil supervillain team.

485
00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:13.922
Nighty-Knight:
You must be so stoked to see us.

486
00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:17.425
Stoked doesn't begin to
describe it. Fright Night.

487
00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:22.013
Get zis. He now wants
to be called "Nighty-Knight."

488
00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:23.306
Nighty-Knight:
It's scarier!

489
00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:25.892
Oh. yes. I'm terrified.

490
00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:29.229
Nighty-Knight:
See? Megamind gets my darkness.

491
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.107
- That's why he
left me in charge. - (gasps)

492
00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:33.983
But that's not why we're here.

493
00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:36.319
We heard all about
your new job.

494
00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:37.904
(gasps) You did?

495
00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:40.907
Nighty-Knight:
Yeah! You think we were gonna let that go

496
00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:42.909
without paying you a visit?

497
00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.745
Let him have it. Behemoth!

498
00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:47.706
- (Megamind gasps)
- (rumbling)

499
00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:48.748
(roars)

500
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.042
Guys!
Can't we just talk this--

501
00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:52.293
Ah!

502
00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:56.256
- (party horn blowing)
- The Doom Syndicate: Congratulations!

503
00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.340
What?

504
00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:58.508
(singing):
* For he's a horrible *

505
00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.718
* Evil fellow *

506
00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.761
* Which nobody can deny *

507
00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:03.346
* Because he's now
their evil overlord *

508
00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:06.683
* And they're likely to receive
an unusually cruel punishment *

509
00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:08.476
(cheering)

510
00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:12.731
Imagine. ze entire city
thinks you are a hero!

511
00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:15.817
When you said lay low in prison
and wait for your signal.

512
00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:19.112
we had no idea
it was gonna be this!

513
00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:22.824
- Not even I could
conjure such an illusion. - (bell tolling)

514
00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:25.994
Nighty-Knight:
It's dark. it's messed up.

515
00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:27.996
and I love it. (laughing)

516
00:21:28.038 --> 00:21:29.164
Huh?

517
00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:32.459
- (yelps)
- Oh yeah. that's the stuff.

518
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.129
You think
I'm pretending to be a hero.

519
00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:37.964
- Nighty-Knight: Huh?
- Oh.

520
00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:40.800
- (dramatic crescendo)
- And you'd be right. of course!

521
00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:43.762
That was absolutely
my intention.

522
00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:47.432
There no way Megamind
could be real hero.

523
00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:50.101
That would be great
betrayal and cause

524
00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:52.270
much anger in Behemoth!

525
00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:54.230
- (whimpering)
- (flames hissing)

526
00:21:54.272 --> 00:21:56.733
But you not. so Behemoth happy.

527
00:21:56.775 --> 00:21:59.152
- Oh...
- Where is Monsieur Minion?

528
00:21:59.194 --> 00:22:02.655
Ze robot poisson zat would keep
your place so span and spic-y.

529
00:22:02.697 --> 00:22:04.324
Oh. Chum!

530
00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:07.410
He's not here because. uh.

531
00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:08.870
corporate shake-up.

532
00:22:08.912 --> 00:22:11.331
- Lots of internal changes.
- (explosion. glass shatters)

533
00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:13.124
(Roxanne coughing)

534
00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.959
You know you're not
supposed to dry

535
00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:18.004
your metal spiked capes
in the microwave and--

536
00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:19.756
The Doom Syndicate!

537
00:22:19.798 --> 00:22:22.008
What's Roxanne Ritchi
doing here?!

538
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.385
I assure you

539
00:22:23.426 --> 00:22:25.845
there's a completely evil
explanation for this.

540
00:22:27.305 --> 00:22:28.973
We're waiting.

541
00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:31.726
Yeah... so am I.

542
00:22:31.768 --> 00:22:35.480
Roxanne is here.
at this moment. right now.

543
00:22:35.522 --> 00:22:38.024
before us.
because she's agreed...

544
00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:39.275
Syndicate:
Yeah?

545
00:22:39.317 --> 00:22:42.821
- ...to be my evil bride.
- What?!

546
00:22:42.862 --> 00:22:44.656
(whispers)
They still think I'm evil

547
00:22:44.698 --> 00:22:46.408
and only pretending
to be a hero.

548
00:22:46.449 --> 00:22:48.660
- Play along!
- Is this true?

549
00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:52.539
- More like too good to be true!
- (gasps. groans)

550
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.791
I can't believe
you're with her!

551
00:22:54.833 --> 00:22:57.544
She got me fired from
my weather reporting job!

552
00:22:57.585 --> 00:22:59.337
- (groans)
- You got yourself fired

553
00:22:59.379 --> 00:23:01.506
because you never
got a forecast right.

554
00:23:01.548 --> 00:23:02.716
Not to mention turning evil

555
00:23:02.757 --> 00:23:05.552
and throwing lightning
at everybody. Gail.

556
00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:07.971
- (lightning crackling)
- It's Lady Doppler now.

557
00:23:08.013 --> 00:23:11.558
And you two together.
I don't buy it.

558
00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:14.811
Behemoth disagree.
Behemoth always see

559
00:23:14.853 --> 00:23:19.065
certain romantic tension between
blue man and pretty lady.

560
00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:21.609
- Really?
- Really?

561
00:23:21.651 --> 00:23:23.445
Opposites attract. no?

562
00:23:23.486 --> 00:23:26.072
Like crepes and marmalade.

563
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:29.367
Can you guys excuse us?
Need a quick word in the kitchen

564
00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:31.786
with my not-so-better half.

565
00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:34.372
- (splats)
- Ow!

566
00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:36.541
I'll have you know those have
a warm fruit-filled center

567
00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:38.418
that could have left me
horribly disfigured.

568
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.545
Why didn't you
tell them the truth?

569
00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:43.673
Tell them I'm really a hero?
Are you crazy?

570
00:23:43.715 --> 00:23:45.925
There's four of them.
and only one of me!

571
00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:48.928
They'll pound me into
a blue pulp. Roxanne.

572
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.014
They're going to
find out eventually.

573
00:23:51.056 --> 00:23:54.851
Oh. and since when were you
ever part of The Doom Syndicate?

574
00:23:55.352 --> 00:23:56.853
Uh...

575
00:23:57.062 --> 00:23:58.146
Uh...

576
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.274
(sighs) Founding member.
actually.

577
00:24:01.316 --> 00:24:02.901
I was cutting my evil teeth

578
00:24:02.942 --> 00:24:05.612
shortly after graduating
from Villain Shool.

579
00:24:05.653 --> 00:24:08.948
You went to a villain shool?
I mean. school.

580
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.201
Really more of
a mentorship program.

581
00:24:11.242 --> 00:24:14.454
Unfortunately. my evil professor
and I had a falling out.

582
00:24:14.496 --> 00:24:16.998
He kind of went to pieces.
(laughs) Literally.

583
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.668
Always learning
new things about you.

584
00:24:19.709 --> 00:24:23.213
So. I recruited
the very best of the worst.

585
00:24:23.254 --> 00:24:24.464
- (snaps)
- (door creaking)

586
00:24:24.506 --> 00:24:26.257
(whirring. beeping)

587
00:24:27.092 --> 00:24:30.053
- (explosion blasts)
- With me as their handsome leader.

588
00:24:30.095 --> 00:24:34.099
- The Doom Syndicate was
the premier villain team. - (rock music playing)

589
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.935
Man. those were good times.

590
00:24:37.435 --> 00:24:39.729
I mean. they were bad times

591
00:24:39.771 --> 00:24:41.898
that were good when I was bad.

592
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.067
(nervous laugh)
But eventually. I realized

593
00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:46.444
I didn't like sharing
the spotlight.

594
00:24:46.486 --> 00:24:48.029
So. you ditched them?

595
00:24:48.071 --> 00:24:50.740
I told them I was
working on an evil project.

596
00:24:50.782 --> 00:24:53.660
- (brainbot whirs)
- And that I'd signal them when I took over Metrocity.

597
00:24:53.702 --> 00:24:55.829
which they think I have.

598
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.581
Until I can figure out
a way to stop them.

599
00:24:58.623 --> 00:25:01.334
we must keep up
evil appearances.

600
00:25:01.376 --> 00:25:03.837
No. No! No way!

601
00:25:03.878 --> 00:25:06.715
Come on. Roxanne. Please?

602
00:25:06.756 --> 00:25:07.841
No!

603
00:25:08.216 --> 00:25:10.051
Pleas--

604
00:25:10.093 --> 00:25:12.178
And we're back.

605
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.056
So. you guys have any schemes?

606
00:25:15.098 --> 00:25:17.809
I mean.
plans while you're in town?

607
00:25:17.851 --> 00:25:19.602
- (nervous laugh)
- Nighty-Knight: No.

608
00:25:19.644 --> 00:25:22.397
- but this guy does! (laughs)
- (grunts)

609
00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:24.607
(nervous laugh)
I'm not following.

610
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:26.985
Lady Doppler:
We're here for Phase Two. silly.

611
00:25:27.027 --> 00:25:29.320
(gasps) Phase Two.

612
00:25:29.362 --> 00:25:30.697
What's a Phase Two?

613
00:25:30.739 --> 00:25:33.867
Guess your boyfriend
doesn't tell you everything.

614
00:25:33.908 --> 00:25:36.578
Megamind said when
he took over Metro City.

615
00:25:36.619 --> 00:25:38.538
we'd all have a place
in the next phase

616
00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.457
of his evil master plan.

617
00:25:40.498 --> 00:25:43.543
Phase Two is
such a genius plan.

618
00:25:43.585 --> 00:25:46.338
I cannot wait to get started!

619
00:25:46.796 --> 00:25:49.215
Yeah! That's actually
one of the reasons

620
00:25:49.257 --> 00:25:50.967
why I agreed to evil-marry him.

621
00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:53.053
- I love a good Phase Two.
- (yelps)

622
00:25:53.094 --> 00:25:55.597
But. remind me again
what this one is

623
00:25:55.638 --> 00:25:57.724
and what havoc it might wreak?

624
00:25:57.766 --> 00:25:59.851
Would you give us a moment?

625
00:25:59.893 --> 00:26:02.687
Relax. I never even bothered
to finish Phase Two.

626
00:26:02.729 --> 00:26:04.814
- Lady Doppler: Let's roll!
- (Syndicate laughs)

627
00:26:04.856 --> 00:26:07.067
(gasps)
What's the mad rush. guys?

628
00:26:07.108 --> 00:26:08.526
You just got here!

629
00:26:08.568 --> 00:26:11.446
Let's have some fun before
jumping into evil business.

630
00:26:11.488 --> 00:26:13.073
Charades. anyone?

631
00:26:13.448 --> 00:26:15.533
I say we break
in Megamind's city

632
00:26:15.575 --> 00:26:17.744
with a good old-fashioned
crime spree.

633
00:26:17.786 --> 00:26:18.787
Syndicate:
Yeah!

634
00:26:18.828 --> 00:26:20.872
I don't know. guys.

635
00:26:20.914 --> 00:26:23.625
Aren't we all a little above
crime spree-ing at this point?

636
00:26:23.667 --> 00:26:25.251
Syndicate:
No!

637
00:26:25.293 --> 00:26:27.837
Nighty-Knight:
Look out. Metro City. here comes the darkness.

638
00:26:27.879 --> 00:26:30.924
- Lady Doppler: Let's do this!
- Pierre: Away we go!

639
00:26:30.965 --> 00:26:34.260
What a fun and totally
preventable situation

640
00:26:34.302 --> 00:26:35.512
you've created.

641
00:26:35.553 --> 00:26:37.013
Please tell me you have a plan.

642
00:26:37.055 --> 00:26:38.765
Oh. you better warn the mayor.

643
00:26:38.807 --> 00:26:40.892
Meanwhile. I'll try to keep
The Doom Syndicate

644
00:26:40.934 --> 00:26:42.769
from destroying the entire city
while thinking of a plan

645
00:26:42.811 --> 00:26:44.270
to keep them from doing
my other plan.

646
00:26:44.312 --> 00:26:46.314
- (door creaks)
- Make sense?

647
00:26:46.356 --> 00:26:47.857
Yes. but only in the

648
00:26:47.899 --> 00:26:49.776
you're-the-one-saying-it
sort of way.

649
00:26:49.818 --> 00:26:50.860
(dramatic crescendo)

650
00:26:50.902 --> 00:26:53.655
You should know
I'm a people non-person.

651
00:26:53.697 --> 00:26:54.864
I'm a self-starter.

652
00:26:54.906 --> 00:26:56.700
but also enjoy
the collaborative process.

653
00:26:56.741 --> 00:26:58.702
I'm proficient in
robotics. neuroscience.

654
00:26:58.743 --> 00:27:00.620
chemical engineering.
death-ray construction.

655
00:27:00.662 --> 00:27:02.664
bioengineering.
and event planning.

656
00:27:02.706 --> 00:27:04.708
So. anything in those areas.

657
00:27:04.749 --> 00:27:06.835
(fly buzzing)

658
00:27:06.876 --> 00:27:09.295
I'm lookin' for
a toilet scrubber.

659
00:27:09.337 --> 00:27:10.630
That's perfect!

660
00:27:10.672 --> 00:27:12.674
Another item
off my bucket list!

661
00:27:12.716 --> 00:27:15.552
I won't let you down. New Sir.

662
00:27:15.593 --> 00:27:18.304
- (dramatic music playing)
- (panting)

663
00:27:18.346 --> 00:27:21.016
- (horns honking)
- Whoa! Ah!

664
00:27:21.975 --> 00:27:24.436
- (grunting)
- (people screaming)

665
00:27:24.477 --> 00:27:25.687
(explosion blasts)

666
00:27:25.729 --> 00:27:28.898
- (citizens screaming)
- (smashing)

667
00:27:29.774 --> 00:27:31.443
(crash. explosion)

668
00:27:31.484 --> 00:27:34.112
(Lady Doppler and Pierre laugh)

669
00:27:35.947 --> 00:27:39.075
Today's forecast:
frigid cold flurries.

670
00:27:39.117 --> 00:27:41.995
and a hundred percent
chance of doom!

671
00:27:42.037 --> 00:27:43.580
(thundering)

672
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:46.458
(echoing laugh)

673
00:27:46.499 --> 00:27:49.377
Nighty-Knight:
That's a thunderstorm. not a snowstorm.

674
00:27:49.419 --> 00:27:52.130
Whatever. Mr. Nappy-Nap.

675
00:27:52.172 --> 00:27:54.883
- (grunts)
- Behemoth: Behemoth hungry!

676
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.843
(roars)

677
00:27:56.885 --> 00:27:58.345
(chomps. groans)

678
00:27:58.386 --> 00:28:01.556
It is just an advertisement.
you silly rock monster!

679
00:28:01.598 --> 00:28:03.099
**

680
00:28:03.141 --> 00:28:04.184
Huh?

681
00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:08.438
(growls)
Flat man trick Behemoth!

682
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.898
(fireball sizzles)

683
00:28:10.565 --> 00:28:12.067
- (grunts)
- (police siren wails)

684
00:28:12.108 --> 00:28:13.193
(tires screech)

685
00:28:13.234 --> 00:28:14.861
(siren dying)

686
00:28:14.903 --> 00:28:16.529
Officer:
Freeze! Police!

687
00:28:16.571 --> 00:28:18.239
(evil laugh)

688
00:28:18.281 --> 00:28:19.491
(whimpers)

689
00:28:20.408 --> 00:28:21.993
You're all under arrest!

690
00:28:22.035 --> 00:28:23.203
**

691
00:28:23.244 --> 00:28:24.746
Now. officers.

692
00:28:24.788 --> 00:28:27.624
- wouldn't you rather
just arrest yourselves? - (whirring)

693
00:28:28.541 --> 00:28:31.753
Officers (in trance):
I have the right to remain silent.

694
00:28:31.795 --> 00:28:35.215
Anything I say can
and will be used against me

695
00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:37.217
- in the court of law.
- (laughing)

696
00:28:37.258 --> 00:28:39.260
- I have the right to a...
- Au revoir!

697
00:28:39.302 --> 00:28:41.888
Sorry about all this. officers.
We'll have a good chuckle

698
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.349
when you snap out of it
in a few hours.

699
00:28:44.849 --> 00:28:46.434
Nighty-Knight:
The darkness!

700
00:28:46.476 --> 00:28:48.061
(whooshing)

701
00:28:48.103 --> 00:28:49.562
The bedlam!

702
00:28:49.604 --> 00:28:50.647
(window shatters)

703
00:28:50.689 --> 00:28:51.940
The chaos!

704
00:28:51.981 --> 00:28:54.776
- (yelps)
- I feed on it.

705
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.779
- (toy squeaking)
- Huh?

706
00:28:59.614 --> 00:29:01.533
(soft lullaby playing)

707
00:29:01.574 --> 00:29:03.827
(echoing baby cooing)

708
00:29:04.953 --> 00:29:08.665
I will call you
Mr. Cuddly Snuggles.

709
00:29:08.707 --> 00:29:09.958
(squeaks)

710
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.877
No one must know
of our friendship.

711
00:29:13.753 --> 00:29:15.672
Darkness!

712
00:29:15.714 --> 00:29:18.174
(dramatic music playing)

713
00:29:18.216 --> 00:29:19.300
Brainbots. code:

714
00:29:19.342 --> 00:29:20.593
"Fix all the things
the bad guys broke

715
00:29:20.635 --> 00:29:23.513
so I'm not legally
or financially responsible."

716
00:29:23.555 --> 00:29:25.348
(beeping. whirring)

717
00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.183
(brainbots humming)

718
00:29:31.479 --> 00:29:33.898
- (whirring)
- (hammering)

719
00:29:34.315 --> 00:29:35.150
That handles that!

720
00:29:36.109 --> 00:29:39.279
Mayor (on TV):
For his ongoing heroic actions as Metro's defender.

721
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.949
I award Megamind
the key to our fair city.

722
00:29:42.991 --> 00:29:44.868
(audience cheering)

723
00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:46.536
If only
your adoring public knew

724
00:29:46.578 --> 00:29:48.955
- what we had
in store for everyone! - (zapping)

725
00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:51.541
- (Syndicate laughs)
- (Megamind yelps)

726
00:29:51.583 --> 00:29:53.793
Yeah. poor them!

727
00:29:53.835 --> 00:29:55.587
(Syndicate laughing)

728
00:29:55.628 --> 00:29:58.298
- (weak laugh)
- Keiko: Whoa!

729
00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.426
- Those guys are no joke!
- (metal creaking)

730
00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:02.761
(gasping. panting)

731
00:30:02.802 --> 00:30:04.554
(creaking)

732
00:30:04.596 --> 00:30:06.181
- (both grunt)
- (monitor smashes)

733
00:30:09.017 --> 00:30:11.686
- Whoa! Close one!
- You again?

734
00:30:12.103 --> 00:30:13.730
Megamind just
saved yours truly

735
00:30:13.772 --> 00:30:15.857
from becoming
a human vegan pancake!

Oh-ho. my followers
are gonna love that!

739
00:30:21.696 --> 00:30:23.281
And you're much faster
than you look.

740
00:30:23.323 --> 00:30:25.950
- Maybe it's the boots.
- (distant explosions)

741
00:30:25.992 --> 00:30:28.161
- (people screaming)
- (zapping)

742
00:30:29.287 --> 00:30:31.206
You're gonna stop
those guys. right?

743
00:30:31.247 --> 00:30:33.667
Eventually. but right now.
I'm deep undercover.

744
00:30:33.708 --> 00:30:35.001
They still think I'm a villain.

745
00:30:35.043 --> 00:30:36.753
Cool! So. you need my help.

746
00:30:36.795 --> 00:30:38.254
I'll take the volcano guy!

747
00:30:38.296 --> 00:30:40.090
- No. here's what
you need to do. - Whoa!

748
00:30:40.131 --> 00:30:43.426
Use your super-tween speed to
run on home and watch cartoons.

749
00:30:43.468 --> 00:30:46.221
{\an8}I'm more useful than
you think. you know!

750
00:30:46.262 --> 00:30:47.430
{\an8}Ugh!

751
00:30:47.472 --> 00:30:49.099
(dramatic music playing)

752
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.017
Lady Doppler:
Look at that.

753
00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:53.520
A bank just waiting
to be robbed.

754
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:55.980
Let's see some of that
old Megamind magic.

755
00:30:56.022 --> 00:30:58.191
Uh. no thanks. I'm good.

756
00:30:58.233 --> 00:30:59.693
Huh?

757
00:30:59.734 --> 00:31:01.361
I mean. I'm... not good.

758
00:31:01.403 --> 00:31:04.364
It's just important to
keep up good appearances.

759
00:31:04.406 --> 00:31:06.783
Remember. they still
think I'm a hero.

760
00:31:06.825 --> 00:31:08.702
What is ze point. eh?

761
00:31:08.743 --> 00:31:10.704
Phase Deux is just
around the corner.

762
00:31:10.745 --> 00:31:13.206
Nighty-Knight:
Robbing banks was like a ray of dark

763
00:31:13.248 --> 00:31:15.458
in your already
pitch-black soul.

764
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.378
Aw. come on! Please?

765
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.547
Fine! I'll do it.

766
00:31:20.588 --> 00:31:23.425
Even though this sort of bad
is beneath me now.

767
00:31:23.466 --> 00:31:25.885
(dramatic crescendo)

768
00:31:25.927 --> 00:31:30.348
- (tense music playing)
- (quiet bank chatter)

769
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.225
- Bank Manager:
Look! It's Megamind! - (gasps) Uh...

770
00:31:32.267 --> 00:31:34.936
- The hero of Metro City!
- (clapping)

771
00:31:34.978 --> 00:31:38.940
Oh no. Please! Your applause
really isn't necessary.

772
00:31:39.566 --> 00:31:42.694
Nighty-Knight:
I can't wait to see their faces when they realize

773
00:31:42.736 --> 00:31:44.946
evil Megamind is back.

774
00:31:44.988 --> 00:31:47.615
Their sorrow will be delicious.

775
00:31:47.657 --> 00:31:50.785
(deep. mocking voice)
Their sorrow will be delicious.

776
00:31:50.827 --> 00:31:52.412
(normal)
That's what you sound like.

777
00:31:52.996 --> 00:31:54.330
A few days ago.

778
00:31:54.372 --> 00:31:57.125
if you'd have come in.
I'd be hiding under my desk.

779
00:31:57.167 --> 00:32:00.754
Such a relief to know
you're on the good side now.

780
00:32:00.795 --> 00:32:02.881
**

781
00:32:02.922 --> 00:32:05.592
(nervous laugh)
But no need to make a fuss.

782
00:32:05.633 --> 00:32:08.345
{\an8}In fact. why don't you
all go back to treating me

783
00:32:08.386 --> 00:32:10.597
{\an8}- like you did in
the bad old days. - (cocks gun)

784
00:32:10.638 --> 00:32:13.099
But. that's when you were evil.

785
00:32:13.141 --> 00:32:14.809
You kept robbing us.

786
00:32:14.851 --> 00:32:17.270
That's not why
you're here. is it?

787
00:32:17.312 --> 00:32:19.731
I'm sorry.
I have to do this.

788
00:32:19.773 --> 00:32:21.232
B-But why?

789
00:32:21.274 --> 00:32:24.819
Because it's. uh... it's. uh...

790
00:32:24.861 --> 00:32:26.946
- Keiko: It's a safety drill!
- Huh?

791
00:32:26.988 --> 00:32:29.407
For MegaWatch?
Half a million viewers?

792
00:32:29.449 --> 00:32:31.493
We're making this for the kids
at home so they know what to do

793
00:32:31.534 --> 00:32:34.579
in case a real villain
comes into the bank.

794
00:32:34.621 --> 00:32:36.331
Right. Megamind?

795
00:32:36.998 --> 00:32:38.541
Yes?

796
00:32:38.583 --> 00:32:39.793
I mean. yes!

797
00:32:39.834 --> 00:32:43.129
So. let's just pretend
it's like the old days.

798
00:32:43.171 --> 00:32:44.506
It'll be fun! Everyone.

799
00:32:44.547 --> 00:32:46.800
let's get those hands
in the air.

800
00:32:46.841 --> 00:32:48.468
Come on. get 'em up!

801
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.471
(excited chatter)

802
00:32:51.513 --> 00:32:52.806
Oh. I get it!

803
00:32:52.847 --> 00:32:54.224
Did I just save your butt?

804
00:32:54.265 --> 00:32:56.017
- Feels like I just
saved your butt. - Huh?

805
00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:57.977
Just need a quick pic
of the exact moment

806
00:32:58.019 --> 00:32:59.771
- you realized you need me.
- (shutter snaps)

807
00:32:59.813 --> 00:33:02.482
(tense music playing)

808
00:33:02.524 --> 00:33:04.818
I guess he is still
a master villain.

809
00:33:04.859 --> 00:33:07.112
Not only is
he robbing ze place.

810
00:33:07.153 --> 00:33:08.905
he's stopping for selfies!

811
00:33:08.947 --> 00:33:11.366
- Nighty-Knight: He hasn't lost
a dark and twisted step. - (grunting)

812
00:33:11.408 --> 00:33:14.661
I still think
something's off about him.

813
00:33:14.703 --> 00:33:16.705
You are just jealous.

814
00:33:16.746 --> 00:33:18.331
Ze man is a genius!

815
00:33:18.373 --> 00:33:20.417
After all.
he left me in charge.

816
00:33:20.458 --> 00:33:23.545
Nighty-Knight:
What are you talking about? He put me in charge.

817
00:33:23.586 --> 00:33:28.341
He told Behemoth leader
should go by height and girth.

818
00:33:28.383 --> 00:33:30.844
Megamind:
Stay back! (grunts)

819
00:33:30.885 --> 00:33:32.137
Stay back. I say! (sighs)

820
00:33:32.178 --> 00:33:33.555
- (cracking back)
- It certainly was good

821
00:33:33.596 --> 00:33:36.016
to work those old
bank-robbing muscles again.

822
00:33:36.057 --> 00:33:38.560
Okay. we need you
to settle something.

823
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:41.062
Who did you leave in charge
of The Doom Syndicate?

824
00:33:41.104 --> 00:33:43.106
Uh. isn't it obvious?

825
00:33:43.148 --> 00:33:46.943
I chose the evilest
and most qualified candidate.

826
00:33:46.985 --> 00:33:48.570
All:
Thank you!

827
00:33:48.611 --> 00:33:50.655
- Wait?
- Huh?

828
00:33:51.114 --> 00:33:53.116
Mayor:
I'm getting calls from all over!

829
00:33:53.158 --> 00:33:55.035
People are saying
Megamind's running amok

830
00:33:55.076 --> 00:33:56.870
with a group of
villains out there!

831
00:33:56.911 --> 00:33:59.998
He's buying us time until he can
figure out a way to stop them.

832
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.499
Mr. Mayor.
we have to trust him.

833
00:34:01.541 --> 00:34:04.044
We're still cleaning up
after the last time

834
00:34:04.085 --> 00:34:06.963
Megamind "saved" the city.
(struggling)

835
00:34:07.005 --> 00:34:08.923
I don't know what to do!

836
00:34:08.965 --> 00:34:12.218
Nobody told me mayor-ing
would be so hard!

837
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.889
And I can't open
my tummy medicine!

838
00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:17.390
(pops cap)

839
00:34:17.432 --> 00:34:20.310
- (muffled phones ringing)
- (sighs) Thank you. Christina.

840
00:34:20.352 --> 00:34:23.772
Far be it from me to presume to
tell you what to do. Mr. Mayor.

841
00:34:23.813 --> 00:34:27.192
No. no. please! Presume away.
I-I got nothing!

842
00:34:27.233 --> 00:34:29.611
Well. first. you need
to notify law enforcement

843
00:34:29.652 --> 00:34:32.614
to pull back until Megamind
can figure out what to do.

844
00:34:32.655 --> 00:34:35.241
Then. get ahold of emergency
services and have them stand by

845
00:34:35.283 --> 00:34:38.703
- just in case things go wrong.
- Right. Got it.

846
00:34:38.745 --> 00:34:40.246
(tense crescendo)

847
00:34:40.288 --> 00:34:42.374
What did you say after. "first"?

848
00:34:42.415 --> 00:34:45.418
**

849
00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.630
Oh. you wouldn't
believe the day I had.

850
00:34:49.214 --> 00:34:52.384
They wouldn't
understand the new me.

851
00:34:52.425 --> 00:34:54.427
Not like you did. Chum.

852
00:34:55.512 --> 00:34:58.139
But I guess that's
all in the past.

853
00:34:58.181 --> 00:35:00.684
I'm defender of Metrocity now.

854
00:35:00.725 --> 00:35:04.938
and I need to learn to handle
these things on my own.

855
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.067
But how do I take down
four villains at once?

856
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:11.653
Maybe I just need
to sleep on this.

857
00:35:11.695 --> 00:35:12.904
(sighs)

858
00:35:12.946 --> 00:35:16.491
(snoring)

859
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.535
- Ah!
- (muffled music playing)

860
00:35:18.576 --> 00:35:21.037
What is that infernal racket?

861
00:35:21.079 --> 00:35:24.082
- (dance music blasting)
- (gasps)

862
00:35:24.124 --> 00:35:27.502
(party chatter)

863
00:35:28.586 --> 00:35:30.338
(laughs) Woo!

864
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.801
(grunts)

865
00:35:34.843 --> 00:35:36.094
(yelps)

866
00:35:36.136 --> 00:35:38.138
What in the name of
King Tut's cat collection

867
00:35:38.179 --> 00:35:39.431
is going on here?!

868
00:35:39.472 --> 00:35:41.725
Since we're launching
Phase Two tomorrow.

869
00:35:41.766 --> 00:35:45.645
we decided to throw
a Metro City's going-away party.

870
00:35:45.687 --> 00:35:48.064
I didn't agree
to that timeline.

871
00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:50.150
And where did all
these people come from?

872
00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:51.693
Knighty-Night:
Don't worry.

873
00:35:51.735 --> 00:35:53.653
They're all dark
and dangerous criminals.

874
00:35:53.695 --> 00:35:56.072
- (guitar riff ringtone)
- (surprised grunting)

875
00:35:56.114 --> 00:35:59.325
- Ollo?
- Roxanne (on phone): I bought some time with the mayor.

876
00:35:59.367 --> 00:36:00.660
What's all that ruckus?

877
00:36:00.702 --> 00:36:03.204
I'm the victim of
an impromptu rager.

878
00:36:04.289 --> 00:36:05.373
Just a second. Roxanne.

879
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.626
Sir. I'll have you know
that is my special chair!

880
00:36:08.668 --> 00:36:12.005
Off now!
Why aren't you using a coaster?

881
00:36:12.047 --> 00:36:14.257
I want everybody out of here!

882
00:36:14.299 --> 00:36:16.509
Ah. don't be
ze pooper of parties.

883
00:36:16.551 --> 00:36:18.845
Besides. we texted
some old friends

884
00:36:18.887 --> 00:36:20.138
who just broke outta prison.

885
00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.931
They should be here any minute!

886
00:36:21.973 --> 00:36:23.808
- Old friends?
- (door creaks)

887
00:36:25.018 --> 00:36:26.311
- Oh no!
- (dramatic sting)

888
00:36:26.353 --> 00:36:28.480
The Go Fish Gang
just walked in.

889
00:36:28.521 --> 00:36:30.523
If they tell the Syndicate
I'm really a hero

890
00:36:30.565 --> 00:36:32.776
and not a villain
pretending to be a hero.

891
00:36:32.817 --> 00:36:34.986
this could get ugly quick.

892
00:36:35.028 --> 00:36:36.780
There he is!

893
00:36:36.821 --> 00:36:38.031
- Gotta go!
- (ends call)

894
00:36:38.073 --> 00:36:39.866
Attention. everyone!

895
00:36:39.908 --> 00:36:41.326
I said attention!

896
00:36:41.368 --> 00:36:43.036
- (crowd gasps)
- (dance music stops)

897
00:36:43.078 --> 00:36:46.498
There's something you all
should know about your host.

898
00:36:46.539 --> 00:36:47.582
(gasps)

899
00:36:47.624 --> 00:36:49.501
- (beeps)
- Brainbot. lay down a sick beat.

900
00:36:49.542 --> 00:36:51.211
- Big King Fish:
The truth about Megamind-- - Huh?

901
00:36:51.252 --> 00:36:52.253
- (energetic music playing)
- Hey!

902
00:36:52.295 --> 00:36:53.880
Hey! What the--

903
00:36:53.922 --> 00:36:56.216
- Wish I didn't have
to resort to this. - (cracks knuckles)

904

(cheering)

907
00:37:03.932 --> 00:37:07.352
Uh. hold on! Y-You all
should know Megamind--

908
00:37:07.394 --> 00:37:09.437
Has had no formal
dance training!

909
00:37:09.479 --> 00:37:10.814
(audience cheering)

910
00:37:10.855 --> 00:37:14.317
DJ. put another stanky
groove in my pocket.

911
00:37:14.359 --> 00:37:15.443
(beeping)

912
00:37:15.485 --> 00:37:18.905
(new upbeat song playing)

913
00:37:18.947 --> 00:37:20.448
I'll take Megamind.

914
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.493
You two get to that
microphone and warn everybody.

915
00:37:23.535 --> 00:37:26.121
- Blue Mackerel: Hey. look out!
- Red Snapper: Outta my way!

Ah!

920
00:37:34.337 --> 00:37:36.339
Hey! We've got
a dance-off over here!

921
00:37:36.381 --> 00:37:38.133
(crowd cheering)

922
00:37:38.174 --> 00:37:40.927

00:37:40.969 --> 00:37:43.054
(yelling. grunting)

924
00:37:43.096 --> 00:37:45.056
Stand still!

Get back here!

Where'd he go?

937
00:38:17.339 --> 00:38:20.175
(music. cheering fade)

938
00:38:20.216 --> 00:38:21.843
What the...?

939
00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:24.929
(tense music playing)

940
00:38:32.437 --> 00:38:35.357
How many capes
can one guy have?

941
00:38:35.398 --> 00:38:36.524
- Aha!
- (clicks)

942
00:38:36.566 --> 00:38:38.651
- (zapping)

943

4.987. but who's counting?

944
00:38:43.907 --> 00:38:45.116
One down. two to go.

Aha!

(whirring. zaps)

949
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.294
Oh!

- (zaps)
- (yelps)

951
00:38:58.296 --> 00:38:59.631
(laughs)

952
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.511
- (gasps) Oh no!
- (clattering)

953
00:39:06.596 --> 00:39:09.182
Uh. don't mind me!
Just dropped a little plutonium!

954
00:39:09.224 --> 00:39:10.725
(gasps)

955
00:39:10.767 --> 00:39:12.894
Blast you.
Newton's Laws of Motion!

956
00:39:13.186 --> 00:39:14.896
(clinking)

957
00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.941
Gimme!

958
00:39:17.982 --> 00:39:20.860
Hey!
You have dislodged my beverage!

959
00:39:20.902 --> 00:39:24.531
Oh. um. sorry. Pierre.
but that ice cube's gone bad.

960
00:39:25.824 --> 00:39:26.866
Whoa!

961
00:39:30.495 --> 00:39:32.706
- (sign buzzing)
- (car passes)

962
00:39:32.747 --> 00:39:33.915
(sizzling)

963
00:39:37.002 --> 00:39:39.170
Order up.

964
00:39:39.212 --> 00:39:40.463
(toilet flushes)

965
00:39:40.505 --> 00:39:42.882
Hoo! That was a battle!

966
00:39:42.924 --> 00:39:45.719
But I was once again
victorious. New Sir.

967
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.179
By the way. do you have
a few seconds to discuss

968
00:39:48.221 --> 00:39:50.015
some life-altering changes?

969
00:39:50.348 --> 00:39:51.641
(water drips)

970
00:39:51.683 --> 00:39:54.644
Okay. I'll take your
simmering silence as a yes.

971
00:39:54.686 --> 00:39:58.106
Firstly. my keen eye for detail
has noticed that we only get

972
00:39:58.148 --> 00:39:59.649
two customers every day.

973
00:39:59.691 --> 00:40:02.402
Eccentric Eddie and his
pet cockroach Thaddeus.

974
00:40:02.444 --> 00:40:03.445
(Thaddeus squeaking)

975
00:40:03.486 --> 00:40:05.905
But what if we had
more customers?

976
00:40:05.947 --> 00:40:07.574
Now. I know what
you're gonna say.

977
00:40:07.615 --> 00:40:10.452
(imitating)
"Chum. how can I increase my cash flow

978
00:40:10.493 --> 00:40:12.620
in this treacherous economy?"

979
00:40:12.662 --> 00:40:15.081
(normal)
Well. while I was in my office just now.

980
00:40:15.123 --> 00:40:16.708
I came up with a few ideas.

981
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:20.253
First. I'd recommend giving
the place a good scrubbing.

982
00:40:20.295 --> 00:40:22.797
Latest market research shows
people generally don't like

983
00:40:22.839 --> 00:40:25.550
sticking to chairs.
Second. let's face it.

984
00:40:25.592 --> 00:40:28.845
The kitchen staff is
horrendous. New Sir.

985
00:40:29.262 --> 00:40:31.890
- I am the kitchen staff.
- Chum: Oh!

986
00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:33.516
(nervous laugh)

987
00:40:33.558 --> 00:40:35.393
Which is a complete
and utter waste.

988
00:40:35.435 --> 00:40:37.103
With your radiant personality.

989
00:40:37.145 --> 00:40:39.522
you should be out here.
with the customers!

990
00:40:39.564 --> 00:40:41.983
And the fully automated
cooking system I've designed

991
00:40:42.025 --> 00:40:45.320
will allow you to fill this
place with your unique brand

992
00:40:45.362 --> 00:40:48.073
of customer service sunshine.

993
00:40:48.114 --> 00:40:49.324
And finally.

994
00:40:49.366 --> 00:40:51.534
I propose a menu change.

995
00:40:51.576 --> 00:40:53.703
We need to specialize!

996
00:40:53.745 --> 00:40:56.873
And what's the one food
everybody loves?

997
00:40:56.915 --> 00:40:58.249
Donuts!

998
00:40:58.291 --> 00:41:00.377
(grunts. chewing)

999
00:41:00.418 --> 00:41:02.295
Say the word.
and I'll get started.

1000
00:41:02.337 --> 00:41:03.546
Mm!

1001
00:41:03.588 --> 00:41:06.216
You won't regret this. New Sir.

1002
00:41:06.508 --> 00:41:07.717
(creaking)

1003
00:41:13.556 --> 00:41:15.350
- Megamind?
- (Megamind groans)

1004
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.561
- Ah! What's going on?
- (clattering)

1005
00:41:18.603 --> 00:41:21.815
This place is a wreck.
Was there some kind of battle?

1006
00:41:21.856 --> 00:41:23.817
(yelling)
Just a dance one!

1007
00:41:23.858 --> 00:41:27.195
Can you turn off
the music. please?!

1008
00:41:27.237 --> 00:41:28.571
What music?

1009
00:41:28.613 --> 00:41:31.157
(normal)
Oh. that can't be good.

1010
00:41:31.199 --> 00:41:32.826
Did you make muffins?

1011
00:41:32.867 --> 00:41:34.828
Yeah. I'm trying new things.

1012
00:41:34.869 --> 00:41:36.329
**

1013
00:41:36.371 --> 00:41:37.997
(chokes. spits)

1014
00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:40.625
Why are you mad
at my taste buds?!

1015
00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:42.961
I said I was
"trying" new things.

1016
00:41:43.003 --> 00:41:45.839
Ugh. maybe I should use
these on The Doom Syndicate.

1017
00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.674
Still don't have a plan. huh?

1018
00:41:47.716 --> 00:41:49.843
Have you tried just
telling them to leave?

1019
00:41:49.884 --> 00:41:51.970
If I tell them to leave.
they'll ask why.

1020
00:41:52.012 --> 00:41:54.014
And if I tell them why.
they'll get mad.

1021
00:41:54.055 --> 00:41:56.433
And when villains get mad.
they break things.

1022
00:41:56.474 --> 00:41:58.184
And the first thing
they'll break is me.

1023
00:41:58.226 --> 00:42:01.604
And me is one of my favorite
things in the whole wide world!

1024
00:42:01.646 --> 00:42:03.023
Yeah. well. we have to
think of something

1025
00:42:03.064 --> 00:42:05.775
before they do whatever
this Phase Two thing is.

1026
00:42:05.817 --> 00:42:08.028
The problem is
they're always together.

1027
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:11.406
I have to find a way to
take them all out at once.

1028
00:42:11.448 --> 00:42:14.034
Behemoth:
(laughs) Last night rocked!

1029
00:42:14.075 --> 00:42:16.578
- Roxanne's back. Yippee.
- (Pierre laughs)

1030
00:42:16.619 --> 00:42:19.205
Nighty-Knight:
Alright. Muffins!

1031
00:42:19.247 --> 00:42:21.332
- (happy humming)
- Well. now that we've celebrated--

1032
00:42:21.374 --> 00:42:24.210
- (spitting)
- Nighty-Knight: Oh. that's nasty.

1033
00:42:24.252 --> 00:42:26.671
Now that we've celebrated
Megamind's triumph.

1034
00:42:26.713 --> 00:42:29.049
surely it's time for Phase Two.

1035
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.134
Again. my evil hubby

1036
00:42:31.176 --> 00:42:34.596
has so many amazing phases.
I get confused.

1037
00:42:34.929 --> 00:42:38.767
- What exactly is Phase Two?
- Okay.

1038
00:42:38.808 --> 00:42:41.936
Phase Two is
an ingenious plan I had

1039
00:42:41.978 --> 00:42:44.064
to launch Metrocity
to the moon.

1040
00:42:44.105 --> 00:42:47.108
You're joking. right?
How would that even work?

1041
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:50.195
Simple evil genius physics.
really.

1042
00:42:50.236 --> 00:42:52.113
(whirring)

1043
00:42:52.155 --> 00:42:53.490
(soft fanfare playing)

1044
00:42:53.531 --> 00:42:55.617
An energy force field
would entrap air

1045
00:42:55.658 --> 00:42:57.369
and protect the populace
from G forces

1046
00:42:57.410 --> 00:43:01.081
as rockets built beneath
the city would carry it up to

1047
00:43:01.122 --> 00:43:03.875
- and safely land on the moon.
- (beeping)

1048
00:43:03.917 --> 00:43:07.045
- (Syndicate cheering)
- (8-bit sound effects)

1049
00:43:07.087 --> 00:43:09.506
Syndicate:
Phase Two! Phase Two!

1050
00:43:09.547 --> 00:43:12.217
Phase Two! Phase Two!

1051
00:43:12.258 --> 00:43:14.469
(cheering)

1052
00:43:14.511 --> 00:43:16.513
There. we would establish
an entire planet

1053
00:43:16.554 --> 00:43:18.556
devoted to evil-kind.

1054
00:43:18.598 --> 00:43:20.266
Nighty-Knight:
Yeah. imagine.

1055
00:43:20.308 --> 00:43:22.769
- (cheerful music playing)
- All of us living together.

1056
00:43:22.811 --> 00:43:25.814
always for eternity.
Forever.

1057
00:43:25.855 --> 00:43:28.525
Until the last star
falls from the heavens

1058
00:43:28.566 --> 00:43:30.944
and beyond that.
Together.

1059
00:43:30.985 --> 00:43:32.487
All of us.

1060
00:43:32.529 --> 00:43:34.864
Just me and my evil friends.

1061
00:43:34.906 --> 00:43:37.617
living in infinite darkness.

1062
00:43:37.659 --> 00:43:38.785
(squeaks)

1063
00:43:38.827 --> 00:43:40.995
- Why do you have a teddy bear?
- (grunts)

1064
00:43:41.037 --> 00:43:44.124
Nighty-Knight: Give me back
Mr. Cuddly Snuggles!

1065
00:43:44.165 --> 00:43:45.625
There. there.

1066
00:43:45.667 --> 00:43:47.210
- It's gonna be okay.
- (soft lullaby playing)

1067
00:43:47.252 --> 00:43:50.088
Zee? Zis is why no one
thinks you are scary.

1068
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.882
Nighty-Knight:
Teddy bears aren't scary? Yeah.

1069
00:43:52.924 --> 00:43:55.510
- They only eat hikers. idiot!
- (toy squeaks)

1070
00:43:55.552 --> 00:43:57.679
(Roxanne clears throat)

1071
00:43:57.721 --> 00:43:59.597
Getting back to
this plan of yours.

1072
00:43:59.639 --> 00:44:02.308
just curious because
I am super into it.

1073
00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.685
How would that even work?

1074
00:44:03.727 --> 00:44:06.479
Just building the giant
rockets under the city

1075
00:44:06.521 --> 00:44:08.148
would take years.

1076
00:44:08.189 --> 00:44:10.650
(dramatic music playing)

1077
00:44:10.692 --> 00:44:12.402
Megamind:
Actually. it took six months.

1078
00:44:12.444 --> 00:44:13.820
Construction moves pretty fast

1079
00:44:13.862 --> 00:44:15.864
when you don't have to worry
about silly permits

1080
00:44:15.905 --> 00:44:17.115
and union lunch breaks.

1081
00:44:17.157 --> 00:44:19.743
One of the advantages
of being evil. I guess.

1082
00:44:19.784 --> 00:44:21.369
Excuse us. guys.

1083
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:22.704
(yelps)

1084
00:44:22.746 --> 00:44:24.873
I thought you said you
never finished Phase Two.

1085
00:44:24.914 --> 00:44:27.167
Still needs a couple
of coats of paint.

1086
00:44:27.208 --> 00:44:30.045
Also. never totally
satisfied with the decor.

1087
00:44:30.086 --> 00:44:32.297
Let's get in there
and launch those suckers.

1088
00:44:32.339 --> 00:44:35.175
Syndicate:
Yeah!

1089
00:44:35.216 --> 00:44:38.345
Uh. yeah. That'd be
in the launch room.

1090
00:44:38.386 --> 00:44:39.512
(beeping)

1091
00:44:39.554 --> 00:44:41.681
Computer:
Password error. Access denied.

1092
00:44:41.723 --> 00:44:44.726
Oh no.
I've forgotten the password!

1093
00:44:44.768 --> 00:44:47.771
- Okay. plan's foiled.
Time to go! - Hold it!

1094
00:44:47.812 --> 00:44:49.773
You forgot the password?

1095
00:44:49.814 --> 00:44:51.107
Thought it was my birthday.

1096
00:44:51.149 --> 00:44:53.234
Guess not. That's so like me!

1097
00:44:53.276 --> 00:44:54.569
Can we go now?

1098
00:44:54.611 --> 00:44:56.905
Actually. it's not like you.

1099
00:44:56.946 --> 00:44:58.865
See? This is what
I'm talking about.

1100
00:44:58.907 --> 00:45:01.743
He's been acting out of
character since we got here.

1101
00:45:01.785 --> 00:45:04.537
(dramatic music building)

1102
00:45:04.579 --> 00:45:05.705
(squeaks)

1103
00:45:05.747 --> 00:45:09.000
How dare you imply
I have character.

1104
00:45:09.042 --> 00:45:11.252
And who said you could
use my favorite mug?

1105
00:45:11.294 --> 00:45:12.796
**

1106
00:45:12.837 --> 00:45:15.048
Don't forget.
we've been waiting a long time

1107
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:17.175
for your plan here
to come to fruition.

1108
00:45:17.217 --> 00:45:19.761
I don't think you wanna
disappoint your old friends.

1109
00:45:19.803 --> 00:45:22.555
Yes. ominous warning noted.

1110
00:45:22.597 --> 00:45:24.224
How's this for ominous?

1111
00:45:24.265 --> 00:45:26.810
Either we launch
by the end of the day.

1112
00:45:26.851 --> 00:45:28.978
or we level the city.

1113
00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.230
Got it?

1114
00:45:30.271 --> 00:45:31.564
(beeps. door slams)

1115
00:45:31.606 --> 00:45:34.234
Did you really
forget the password?

1116
00:45:34.275 --> 00:45:35.110
Of course not.

1117
00:45:35.151 --> 00:45:37.904
The password is THX8675309.

1118
00:45:37.946 --> 00:45:39.739
It'd take an idiot
to forget that.

1119
00:45:39.781 --> 00:45:41.241
We can't let them
launch the city.

1120
00:45:41.282 --> 00:45:42.992
and we can't let them
destroy it.

1121
00:45:43.034 --> 00:45:44.661
You have to do something.

1122
00:45:44.703 --> 00:45:46.621
Yes. I've been wracking
my brilliant mind

1123
00:45:46.663 --> 00:45:48.039
to come up with a plan.

1124
00:45:48.081 --> 00:45:49.749
Titan was just one villain.

1125
00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:52.502
This is a whole
syndicate of them.

1126
00:45:52.544 --> 00:45:53.920
I can't beat them alone.
Roxanne.

1127
00:45:53.962 --> 00:45:57.007
You don't have to.
You have me. and you have Chum.

1128
00:45:57.048 --> 00:46:00.260
You just need to be willing
to ask for his help.

1129
00:46:00.301 --> 00:46:02.095
Oh. I should have
never let him go.

1130
00:46:02.137 --> 00:46:04.556
He's been by my side
through bad and good.

1131
00:46:04.597 --> 00:46:06.558
never once asking me
for anything.

1132
00:46:06.599 --> 00:46:08.101
Except for the parakeet.

1133
00:46:08.143 --> 00:46:10.770
But again. they're
poop machines. Roxanne.

1134
00:46:10.812 --> 00:46:12.522
Stay on topic.

1135
00:46:12.564 --> 00:46:14.107
(sighs) You're right.

1136
00:46:14.149 --> 00:46:16.943
I need to let Chum
know I appreciate him.

1137
00:46:16.985 --> 00:46:19.946
not just as a colleague.
but as a friend.

1138
00:46:19.988 --> 00:46:23.199
(inspirational music playing)

1139
00:46:24.826 --> 00:46:26.661
Roxanne:
Chum's working here now?

1140
00:46:26.911 --> 00:46:29.456
They called me
for a reference.

1141
00:46:29.497 --> 00:46:30.790
Used to be a diner.

1142
00:46:30.832 --> 00:46:32.417
but I don't remember
it being so popular.

1143
00:46:32.459 --> 00:46:35.086
Just with the health department.
And cockroaches.

1144
00:46:35.128 --> 00:46:36.963
(shudders)
Vile creatures!

1145
00:46:37.005 --> 00:46:39.507
I despise them more than
button-down collars.

1146
00:46:39.549 --> 00:46:43.970
Okay... guess I know what not
to get you for your birthday.

1147
00:46:45.347 --> 00:46:46.306
Uh. excuse us?

1148
00:46:46.348 --> 00:46:49.142
I'll try my best.
Name. please?

1149
00:46:49.184 --> 00:46:52.562
Uh. Megamind.
defender of Metrocity.

1150
00:46:52.604 --> 00:46:54.022
I'm kind of a big deal.

1151
00:46:54.064 --> 00:46:56.816
Oh. I'm sorry. Mr. Deal.

1152
00:46:56.858 --> 00:46:58.818
Your name's not on
the reservation list.

1153
00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.987
Reservations? For donuts?

1154
00:47:01.029 --> 00:47:03.782
We're not here to eat.
There's an emergency.

1155
00:47:03.823 --> 00:47:06.451
Let me guess.
A fashion one?

1156
00:47:06.493 --> 00:47:07.786
Excuse me?

1157
00:47:07.827 --> 00:47:09.245
- (cracks knuckles)
- Ma'am. you give me no choice

1158
00:47:09.287 --> 00:47:11.664
but to assert my
dominance upon you.

1159
00:47:12.123 --> 00:47:15.585
(grunting. struggling)

1160
00:47:16.711 --> 00:47:18.421
Roxanne. it's no use.

1161
00:47:18.463 --> 00:47:21.091
Clearly. this hostess is
trained in Krav Magoo.

1162
00:47:21.132 --> 00:47:22.842
You guys having
a little trouble?

1163
00:47:22.884 --> 00:47:24.511
How are you always around?!

1164
00:47:24.552 --> 00:47:27.430
Us girls gotta have our
secrets. am I right?

1165
00:47:27.472 --> 00:47:30.600
Seriously. dunno how you guys
survived this long without me.

1166
00:47:30.642 --> 00:47:32.310
Think you can do better?

1167
00:47:33.561 --> 00:47:36.523
Keiko Morita. MegaWatch.
You could let my friend in

1168
00:47:36.564 --> 00:47:39.192
or I could post a scathing
review to my many followers

1169
00:47:39.234 --> 00:47:41.861
mentioning the restaurant's
cockroach infestation.

1170
00:47:41.903 --> 00:47:45.949
{\an8}- Nice try. but we don't have
a cockroach infestation. - (chirping)

1171
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:47.701
(screams)

1172
00:47:47.742 --> 00:47:49.244
Ew! She's touching it!

1173
00:47:49.285 --> 00:47:52.288
Keiko's hand modeling career
is over before it even started!

1174
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:55.041
He's harmless.
Just needed the distraction.

1175
00:47:55.083 --> 00:47:57.502
- Thanks. Eccentric Eddie.
I owe you one. - (chirping)

1176
00:47:57.544 --> 00:47:59.295
Don't mention it. kid!

1177
00:47:59.337 --> 00:48:02.382
I remember when this place
used to be cool.

1178
00:48:02.424 --> 00:48:03.633
**

1179
00:48:03.675 --> 00:48:05.260
I don't approve
of your methods.

1180
00:48:05.301 --> 00:48:07.137
but you're starting
to grow on me.

1181
00:48:07.178 --> 00:48:09.347
Like a pleasant fungus.

1182
00:48:09.389 --> 00:48:10.849
(crowd chatter)

1183
00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:12.392
- Wow.
- (bright music playing)

1184
00:48:12.434 --> 00:48:15.228
They've really
cleaned this place up!

1185
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:16.521
(beeping)

1186
00:48:16.563 --> 00:48:17.939
Chum:
Then he said.

1187
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:20.900
"Crime. it's a hard
halibut to break!"

1188
00:48:20.942 --> 00:48:22.902
(laughter)

1189
00:48:22.944 --> 00:48:24.446
(gasps)
Previous Sir?

1190
00:48:25.196 --> 00:48:26.614
(embarrassed whimper)

1191
00:48:26.656 --> 00:48:27.699
(grunts)

1192
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:30.452
What are you doing here?

1193
00:48:30.493 --> 00:48:33.121
(awkwardly) Oh. Chum.
What are the odds?

1194
00:48:33.163 --> 00:48:36.458
Us running into each other
at my favorite eatery...

1195
00:48:36.499 --> 00:48:39.961
that I've just walked into
for the first time.

1196
00:48:41.504 --> 00:48:44.507
But. I'm not really
here for donuts.

1197
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:46.176
Oh. but do try one. sir.

1198
00:48:47.635 --> 00:48:49.304
Chum. I came here to--
(gulps)

1199
00:48:49.346 --> 00:48:52.599
Oh. my stars! It's like
a jamboree in my mouth!

1200
00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:53.933
(gulps) Mm.

1201
00:48:53.975 --> 00:48:56.227
But. I came here to
tell you something

1202
00:48:56.269 --> 00:48:59.105
that's not easy for me to say.

1203
00:48:59.147 --> 00:49:02.734
I want you to know
I've always really appreciated--

1204
00:49:02.776 --> 00:49:04.444
New Sir:
Chum. good buddy!

1205
00:49:04.486 --> 00:49:05.779
Oh. uh. New Sir.

1206
00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.698
this is my old boss.
Previous Sir.

1207
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.450
Pleasure to meet you.

1208
00:49:10.492 --> 00:49:12.285
I go by Mr. Donut now.

1209
00:49:12.327 --> 00:49:14.204
It was Chum's idea.
and he's told me

1210
00:49:14.245 --> 00:49:16.456
some pretty great things
about you!

1211
00:49:16.498 --> 00:49:18.416
(nervous laugh)
Guilty as charged.

1212
00:49:18.458 --> 00:49:21.294
Though a few were
just indictments. (sighs) Wow.

1213
00:49:21.336 --> 00:49:24.798
It looks like he's getting
along rather well without me.

1214
00:49:24.839 --> 00:49:27.759
Chum is a dream come true!

1215
00:49:27.801 --> 00:49:30.512
Business is booming!
Check this out!

1216
00:49:30.553 --> 00:49:31.763
**

1217
00:49:31.805 --> 00:49:34.641
Not only has he fully
automated the kitchen...

1218
00:49:34.683 --> 00:49:36.851
(beeping. whirring)

1219
00:49:36.893 --> 00:49:41.064
...but he also came up with
the recipe for my secret glaze.

1220
00:49:41.106 --> 00:49:42.524
(chomps) Mm!

1221
00:49:43.733 --> 00:49:45.026
Listen to me. kid.

1222
00:49:45.068 --> 00:49:47.112
I know I was a bit of
a grouch when you started.

1223
00:49:47.153 --> 00:49:49.447
You? New Sir. no!

1224
00:49:49.489 --> 00:49:51.741
No. no. no. it's true.
But I want you to know.

1225
00:49:51.783 --> 00:49:55.495
I appreciate everything you've
done for me as a colleague.

1226
00:49:55.537 --> 00:49:58.373
But more importantly.
as a friend.

1227
00:50:00.834 --> 00:50:02.877
- Oh. Uh...
- Mr. Donut: So.

1228
00:50:02.919 --> 00:50:04.963
- I got you somethin'.
- (gasps)

1229
00:50:05.005 --> 00:50:07.173
Your filthy unwashed apron?

1230
00:50:07.215 --> 00:50:08.508
But you cherish this!

1231
00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:12.345
And now. it's your
filthy unwashed apron.

1232
00:50:12.887 --> 00:50:14.305
Wow!

1233
00:50:14.347 --> 00:50:17.559
(emotional music playing)

1234
00:50:20.353 --> 00:50:22.814
You were about to tell me
something. Previous Sir?

1235
00:50:22.856 --> 00:50:26.109
Yes.
I wanted you to know...

1236
00:50:27.819 --> 00:50:29.571
that I'm too late.

1237
00:50:29.612 --> 00:50:32.449
It's clear this is
where you belong now.

1238
00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:35.702
Just know letting you go
is the biggest regret

1239
00:50:35.744 --> 00:50:38.163
of my soon-to-be short life.

1240
00:50:38.204 --> 00:50:40.457
Previous Sir. are you
in some kind of trouble?

1241
00:50:41.082 --> 00:50:43.418
It's not your concern anymore.

1242
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:47.922
Besides. it's nothing
I can't not handle on my own.

1243
00:50:47.964 --> 00:50:50.216
Goodbye. old friend.

1244
00:50:51.843 --> 00:50:53.762
Just do me one favor.

1245
00:50:54.763 --> 00:50:57.015
Be happy.

1246
00:50:57.057 --> 00:50:58.600
(door creaks)

1247
00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:06.149
Where's Chum?

1248
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:09.569
He's where
he truly belongs now.

1249
00:51:10.362 --> 00:51:11.488
(sighs)

1250
00:51:11.529 --> 00:51:14.199
I can't put
this off any longer.

1251
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.076
I have to stop
The Doom Syndicate myself.

1252
00:51:16.117 --> 00:51:19.871
Even if it most certainly
leads to my demise.

1253
00:51:19.913 --> 00:51:21.122
- (beeps)
- Car.

1254
00:51:21.456 --> 00:51:23.416
- What are you gonna do? (gasps)
- (car whooshing)

1255
00:51:23.458 --> 00:51:26.544
Hopefully come up
with a really good idea.

1256
00:51:26.586 --> 00:51:30.382
- That's all I got.
- Listen. you don't have to do this alone.

1257
00:51:30.423 --> 00:51:33.426
I'm the defender of
Metrocity. Roxanne.

1258
00:51:33.468 --> 00:51:36.179
If I don't look out for
this place. who will?

1259
00:51:36.221 --> 00:51:38.431
- (slams door)
- (tires squeal)

1260
00:51:38.473 --> 00:51:40.934
But. who's gonna
look out for him?

1261
00:51:40.975 --> 00:51:43.144
- (dramatic crescendo)
- (chomps)

1262
00:51:43.478 --> 00:51:45.563
Announcer (on TV):
Welcome to Season 27

1263
00:51:45.605 --> 00:51:50.443
- of "Crab Cake Wars:
Crustacean Devastation." - (sighs)

1264
00:51:51.486 --> 00:51:53.363
- Six culinary...
- Megamind: Ollo.

1265
00:51:53.405 --> 00:51:55.782
And where have you been?

1266
00:51:55.824 --> 00:51:58.535
Oh. just reminiscing
about days gone by.

1267
00:51:58.576 --> 00:52:02.122
Fragmented memories
of the way we were.

1268
00:52:02.455 --> 00:52:06.376
- What's he talking about?
- Behemoth get the picture.

1269
00:52:06.793 --> 00:52:09.963
Picture...
That's the really good idea

1270
00:52:10.005 --> 00:52:11.589
I was looking for. Behemoth!

1271
00:52:11.631 --> 00:52:14.050
Since this is our
last night on Earth.

1272
00:52:14.092 --> 00:52:16.052
we should really get
a picture of all of us.

1273
00:52:16.094 --> 00:52:18.513
- Brainbot 227?
- (whirring)

1274
00:52:18.555 --> 00:52:20.682
Everybody squeeze in tight.

1275
00:52:20.724 --> 00:52:22.475
Come on! Don't be shy!

1276
00:52:22.517 --> 00:52:25.228
I really wanna
capture this moment.

1277
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:26.855
Don't you wanna be in it?

1278
00:52:26.896 --> 00:52:28.189
Maybe the next one.

1279
00:52:28.231 --> 00:52:31.901
Come on! Let's get some
grimaces on those faces.

1280
00:52:31.943 --> 00:52:33.278
(groans)

1281
00:52:33.319 --> 00:52:36.489
On a count of three.
everyone say. "Porta-Prison"!

1282
00:52:36.531 --> 00:52:39.367
Syndicate:
Three. two. one... Porta-Prison?

1283
00:52:39.409 --> 00:52:41.494
- (whirring. zapping)
- Wait!

1284
00:52:41.536 --> 00:52:44.164
And boom goes your
days of freedom!

1285
00:52:44.205 --> 00:52:46.332
Oh yeah! Aha! Ooh!

1286
00:52:46.374 --> 00:52:48.668
- (Syndicate groaning)
- Nighty-Knight: What's going on?

1287
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:51.921
I'll tell you what's
going on you guys.

1288
00:52:51.963 --> 00:52:54.341
- Prison uniforms! (laughs)
- (yelps)

1289
00:52:54.382 --> 00:52:56.426
If this is a joke.
it's not funny.

1290
00:52:56.468 --> 00:52:58.428
Not for you.
but I'll be laughing

1291
00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:00.889
your whole way back to prison.

1292
00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:03.391
Our patience is wearing thin.

1293
00:53:03.433 --> 00:53:05.226
You know what's
gonna make you thin?

1294
00:53:05.268 --> 00:53:06.519
Prison food!

1295
00:53:06.561 --> 00:53:08.104
I could do these all day.

1296
00:53:08.146 --> 00:53:09.814
so let's just cut to the chase.

1297
00:53:09.856 --> 00:53:12.025
I'm really a good guy!

1298
00:53:12.067 --> 00:53:14.486
A champion of justice. A hero!

1299
00:53:14.527 --> 00:53:16.654
(gasps)
No! (whimpers)

1300
00:53:16.696 --> 00:53:18.490
You watch your language
in front of Behemoth!

1301
00:53:18.531 --> 00:53:20.283
Nighty-Knight:
I have been noticing

1302
00:53:20.325 --> 00:53:22.494
Megamind acting strange lately.

1303
00:53:22.535 --> 00:53:24.871
- and not in a good. dark way.
- Oui!

1304
00:53:24.913 --> 00:53:29.042
Idiots! I've been saying
that the entire time!

1305
00:53:29.084 --> 00:53:30.877
If Megamind really hero.

1306
00:53:30.919 --> 00:53:34.964
why he not be honest
and tell old evil friends?

1307
00:53:35.006 --> 00:53:37.550
Because you'd all destroy me!

1308
00:53:37.592 --> 00:53:39.761
That's why you're
locked safely in a...

1309
00:53:39.803 --> 00:53:41.513
(zapping. glitching)

1310
00:53:41.554 --> 00:53:43.556
...malfunctioning Porta-Prison?

1311

(glitching)

1312
00:53:45.767 --> 00:53:47.227
(yelps)

1313
00:53:47.268 --> 00:53:50.313
Man. I really got you guys!

1314
00:53:50.355 --> 00:53:53.858
It's a prank. bros!
Now. who's hungry?

1315
00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:56.319
Oh. if it was a prank.
then why are you sweating?

1316
00:53:56.361 --> 00:53:59.197
Sweating? Who's sweating?

1317
00:53:59.239 --> 00:54:00.865
(trickling)

1318
00:54:00.907 --> 00:54:03.410
Blast you. sweat bead.
Don't do this to me!

1319
00:54:03.451 --> 00:54:05.412
Go back from whence you came!

Attention. everyone!
Megamind really is a hero!

1323
00:54:13.253 --> 00:54:15.547
He's not pretending!

1324
00:54:15.588 --> 00:54:16.840
Wait. how did we get here?

1325
00:54:16.881 --> 00:54:19.092
Nice of you to pop in.
Megamind's ours.

1326
00:54:19.134 --> 00:54:21.511
but feel free to enjoy the show.
Get him!

Nighty-Knight: Time to say.
"Nighty. night!"

1334
00:54:36.317 --> 00:54:37.444
See. guys?
In the proper context.

1335
00:54:37.485 --> 00:54:39.612
that name is frightening.

Think you can just

With its hero dead.
Metro City belongs to us now.

1360
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:33.041
But maybe it's time we relocated
to a better neighborhood.

1361
00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:36.002
Mongolia?

1362
00:55:36.044 --> 00:55:37.170
The moon. Behemoth.

1363
00:55:37.212 --> 00:55:39.089
I'm talking about the moon.

I failed you.

I failed everyone.

Megamind's close.

Roxanne:
How do you know that?

1375
00:56:12.914 --> 00:56:14.749
The fan club pin I gave him
has a tracker in it.

1376
00:56:14.791 --> 00:56:17.627
- (beeping)
- Roxanne: That's pretty devious.

1377
00:56:17.669 --> 00:56:20.130
You are his number-one fan.

1378
00:56:20.922 --> 00:56:23.675
(sighs) This is kind of
a sketchy neighborhood.

1379
00:56:23.717 --> 00:56:26.261
Going where the danger is
is part of our job.

1380
00:56:26.302 --> 00:56:28.471
Besides.
we've always got diplomacy.

1381
00:56:28.513 --> 00:56:30.640
Oh. Did you learn
that in school?

1382
00:56:30.682 --> 00:56:33.101
No. Diplomacy is just
what I call my bat.

1383
00:56:33.143 --> 00:56:36.563
- (laughs) Keiko. I think
you're gonna fit in just fine. - (phone chiming)

1384
00:56:36.604 --> 00:56:39.315
- (gasps) Stop the van!
- (tires screech)

1385
00:56:39.357 --> 00:56:41.943
(tense music playing)

1386
00:56:41.985 --> 00:56:43.445
(Keiko opens van door)

1387
00:56:47.115 --> 00:56:48.116
(gasps)

1388
00:56:52.287 --> 00:56:54.205
Megamind...

1389
00:56:54.748 --> 00:56:56.791
Megamind (echoing):
Never heard of him...

1390
00:57:03.631 --> 00:57:05.925
We've been looking for you
all over the city!

1391
00:57:05.967 --> 00:57:08.303
Wait. what's with
the fake beard?

1392
00:57:08.345 --> 00:57:10.805
You look like
a sad blue wizard.

1393
00:57:10.847 --> 00:57:13.725
(sighs)
Obviously. I'm hiding.

1394
00:57:13.767 --> 00:57:16.353
The city belongs to
The Doom Syndicate now.

1395
00:57:16.394 --> 00:57:18.980
Oh. here!
I have one for you. too.

1396
00:57:19.022 --> 00:57:19.981
We can be beard buddies.

1397
00:57:20.023 --> 00:57:21.608
I don't wanna
be beard buddies!

1398
00:57:21.649 --> 00:57:24.277
I want you to get off
your butt and save the city!

1399
00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:25.904
You're the only one who can.

1400
00:57:26.196 --> 00:57:27.822
Look. that's a nice sentiment.

1401
00:57:27.864 --> 00:57:29.866
but I've made a new life here.

1402
00:57:29.908 --> 00:57:33.244
Yeah. The piles of trash
really tie the alley together.

1403
00:57:33.286 --> 00:57:35.455
Thank you. Madam President.

1404
00:57:35.497 --> 00:57:37.499
Wait. how did you two
find me anyway?

1405
00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.043
Us girls gotta
have our secrets.

1406
00:57:40.085 --> 00:57:43.213
Well. that's adorable.
but there's no point.

1407
00:57:43.254 --> 00:57:45.215
I gave the hero thing a shot.

1408
00:57:45.674 --> 00:57:48.051
I can't protect this city.

1409
00:57:48.093 --> 00:57:49.511
I failed.

1410
00:57:49.552 --> 00:57:52.222
**

1411
00:57:52.263 --> 00:57:54.474
You didn't fail me.

1412
00:57:54.516 --> 00:57:55.600
What do you mean?

1413
00:57:55.934 --> 00:57:58.228
When I first moved to
Metro City with my mom.

1414
00:57:58.269 --> 00:58:00.105
I got teased a lot.

1415
00:58:00.146 --> 00:58:01.606
My name. the way I dressed.

1416
00:58:01.648 --> 00:58:03.817
the way I just say
whatever's on my mind.

1417
00:58:03.858 --> 00:58:05.402
I think being an outsider.

1418
00:58:05.443 --> 00:58:07.487
people just assumed
I was a bad kid.

1419
00:58:07.529 --> 00:58:09.989
I started being what
they expected of me.

1420
00:58:10.031 --> 00:58:12.158
getting into fights.
skipping class.

1421
00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.703
But then. you stopped Titan.

1422
00:58:15.412 --> 00:58:17.038
It showed me maybe
I don't have to live up

1423
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.540
to others' expectations.

1424
00:58:18.581 --> 00:58:20.875
I just have to
live up to my own.

1425
00:58:20.917 --> 00:58:23.503
If a bad guy can become a hero.

1426
00:58:23.545 --> 00:58:25.630
maybe so can a bad kid.

1427
00:58:25.672 --> 00:58:27.257
Must be disappointing to see

1428
00:58:27.298 --> 00:58:30.051
your hero's such a fraidy-cat.

1429
00:58:30.093 --> 00:58:32.095
No! Shows you're smart!

1430
00:58:32.137 --> 00:58:33.888
Because you have zero
chance of defeating

1431
00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:35.557
The Doom Syndicate on your own.

1432
00:58:35.598 --> 00:58:37.267
I thought you
were my biggest fan.

1433
00:58:37.308 --> 00:58:39.644
I am. but I'm also a realist.

1434
00:58:39.686 --> 00:58:43.648
I'm both comforted
and confused by this pep talk.

1435
00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:45.984
Look. putting aside
your silly pride

1436
00:58:46.026 --> 00:58:48.653
and admitting you
need help is not weak.

1437
00:58:48.987 --> 00:58:51.364
I think you'll find
a true friend is with you.

1438
00:58:51.406 --> 00:58:52.615
no matter what.

1439
00:58:52.657 --> 00:58:54.367
You guys continue
your gooey moment.

1440
00:58:54.409 --> 00:58:56.286
I'm gonna go watch our six.

1441
00:58:59.956 --> 00:59:02.625
This is a big no-matter-what.

1442
00:59:02.917 --> 00:59:05.337
You get our backs.
we'll get yours.

1443
00:59:05.378 --> 00:59:07.756
(emotional music playing)

1444
00:59:07.797 --> 00:59:10.717
Okay. but I've got
to find Chum.

1445
00:59:10.759 --> 00:59:12.802
I'm gonna tell him
I took him for granted.

1446
00:59:12.844 --> 00:59:14.721
He's more than a lackey to me.

1447
00:59:14.763 --> 00:59:16.723
He's a partner. a friend.

1448
00:59:16.765 --> 00:59:19.768
and I'm gonna ask for his help.

1449
00:59:19.809 --> 00:59:22.479
Chum:
You don't need to ask.

1450
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.940
Chum?
What are you doing here?

1451
00:59:26.399 --> 00:59:28.068
My work is done with Mr. Donut.

1452
00:59:28.109 --> 00:59:30.945
But. Sir. my work is
never done with you.

1453
00:59:30.987 --> 00:59:33.365
Your constant state of chaos
makes me feel

1454
00:59:33.406 --> 00:59:35.241
as though I'm always needed.

1455
00:59:35.283 --> 00:59:38.661
You are. Ol' Chum. You are.

1456
00:59:38.703 --> 00:59:42.457
After all. what's a hero
without his sidekick?

1457
00:59:42.499 --> 00:59:44.834
Sidekick? Really. sir?

1458
00:59:44.876 --> 00:59:47.545
I can't tell you how long
I've waited for this!

1459
00:59:47.587 --> 00:59:48.630
Keiko:
Diplomacy!

1460
00:59:48.922 --> 00:59:50.674
- (smashes)
- (Chum yelps. grunts)

1461
00:59:50.715 --> 00:59:52.509
Ah! I'm so sorry. Chum!

1462
00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:54.260
I didn't know it was you.

1463
00:59:54.302 --> 00:59:55.595
Big fan. by the way.

1464
00:59:55.637 --> 00:59:57.389
Chum (groggy):
Wonderful to meet you.

1465
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:59.057
- (Behemoth growling)
- (clanging)

1466
00:59:59.099 --> 01:00:02.268
Nighty-Knight:
The darkness compels you to hit it harder.

1467
01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:04.396
Behemoth is hitting it harder!

1468
01:00:04.437 --> 01:00:06.356
Oh. how long is
this gonna take?

1469
01:00:06.398 --> 01:00:10.110
This titanium plating is
a formidable foe to our powers.

1470
01:00:10.151 --> 01:00:12.362
but. eventually. it will
yield to the darkness.

1471
01:00:12.404 --> 01:00:14.322
as all things do.

1472
01:00:14.531 --> 01:00:16.282
In non-goth speak. please?

1473
01:00:16.324 --> 01:00:19.035
Nighty-Knight:
About an hour if we don't break for snacks.

1474
01:00:19.077 --> 01:00:20.328
(whirring)

1475
01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:21.788
Chum:
By my calculations.

1476
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:23.623
they should be able to break
through the security door

1477
01:00:23.665 --> 01:00:24.958
within the hour.

1478
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.418
if they don't break for snacks.

1479
01:00:26.459 --> 01:00:27.961
We need to draw
The Doom Syndicate

1480
01:00:28.003 --> 01:00:30.005
away from those
launch controls.

1481
01:00:30.046 --> 01:00:31.214
A distraction.

1482
01:00:31.256 --> 01:00:33.425
Something they hate
with so much passion.

1483
01:00:33.466 --> 01:00:35.969
it overrides
their evil mission.

1484
01:00:36.011 --> 01:00:37.846
But what?

1485
01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.642
Right!
With all the excitement.

1486
01:00:42.684 --> 01:00:45.520
I forgot they want me dead!
What luck.

1487
01:00:45.812 --> 01:00:48.106
There is a second entrance
to the control room.

1488
01:00:48.148 --> 01:00:49.107
the air vent.

1489
01:00:49.149 --> 01:00:50.650
Can someone get in
through there?

1490
01:00:50.692 --> 01:00:52.318
(sighs) Unfortunately.
we made sure

1491
01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.654
every inch of our lair's
air conditioning system

1492
01:00:54.696 --> 01:00:57.282
was protected by the very
latest in evil weaponry.

1493
01:00:57.323 --> 01:01:00.201
Chum and I prepared
for every possible scenario.

1494
01:01:00.243 --> 01:01:02.829
Except you having to
get back in yourselves.

1495
01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:05.373
- Too-shah.
- Both: It's touché.

1496
01:01:05.832 --> 01:01:09.002
But we're not
our old selves anymore.

1497
01:01:09.044 --> 01:01:11.338
We're better.
We're heroes now!

1498
01:01:11.379 --> 01:01:13.423
And I know the new good us's

1499
01:01:13.465 --> 01:01:15.216
can outthink the old bad us's.

1500
01:01:15.258 --> 01:01:17.427
I can get through
that air vent. Sir.

1501
01:01:17.469 --> 01:01:19.179
You can depend on me.

1502
01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:21.348
I have no doubt I can.

1503
01:01:21.389 --> 01:01:24.184
That leaves you and me
to keep the bad guys busy.

1504
01:01:24.225 --> 01:01:27.145
But. how are we gonna do that
when they have all your toys?

1505
01:01:27.187 --> 01:01:29.564
They're half-wits.
We're full-wits!

1506
01:01:29.606 --> 01:01:30.857
I'm sure we can
think of something

1507
01:01:30.899 --> 01:01:32.317
if we all put our
heads together.

1508
01:01:32.359 --> 01:01:35.445
(triumphant music playing)

1509
01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:37.864
Huh. We're one head short.

1510
01:01:37.906 --> 01:01:40.116
Keiko? Get in here!

1511
01:01:40.158 --> 01:01:41.368
Seriously?

1512
01:01:41.409 --> 01:01:43.286
Thought you wanted to be
a member of the team.

1513
01:01:43.328 --> 01:01:46.873
Uh. yeah! Uh. but just so
I have this on the record.

1514
01:01:46.915 --> 01:01:48.083
you and I have a deal.

1515
01:01:48.124 --> 01:01:49.125
- (starts recording)
- I help you.

1516
01:01:49.167 --> 01:01:51.252
you train me
to be a crime fighter.

1517
01:01:51.294 --> 01:01:52.879
You help me.

1518
01:01:52.921 --> 01:01:55.215
I'll train you to be
a crime fighter.

1519
01:01:55.256 --> 01:01:57.008
You have my word.

1520
01:01:57.050 --> 01:02:00.178
Which is something
I apparently have to keep now.

1521
01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.096
(stops recording)

1522
01:02:02.347 --> 01:02:04.766
Time to kick some
Doom Syndicate booty.

1523
01:02:04.808 --> 01:02:07.894
Spoken like a true
defender of Metro City.

1524
01:02:07.936 --> 01:02:09.771
This city doesn't
need a defender.

1525
01:02:09.813 --> 01:02:11.356
It needs defenders.

1526
01:02:11.398 --> 01:02:14.359
But first. we're gonna
wanna make a supply run.

1527
01:02:14.401 --> 01:02:15.694
I know where we can go.

1528
01:02:15.735 --> 01:02:16.778
(cart rattling)

1529
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.822
Welcome to Everything City.

1530
01:02:18.863 --> 01:02:20.615
500.000 square feet

1531
01:02:20.657 --> 01:02:22.742
with over 500 locations
in all 50 states.

1532
01:02:22.784 --> 01:02:24.285
Just like the commercial says.

1533
01:02:24.327 --> 01:02:26.705
"If the thing you're looking
for is not at Everything City.

1534
01:02:26.746 --> 01:02:27.747
it's not a thing."

1535
01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:29.582
- (grunts) Chum.
- (cart rattles)

1536
01:02:29.624 --> 01:02:32.293
Set a course for savings!

1537
01:02:32.335 --> 01:02:33.962
(retail Muzak playing)

1538
01:02:34.004 --> 01:02:36.131
Welcome to Everything City!

1539
01:02:36.506 --> 01:02:38.925
We've got less than an hour
to stop The Doom Syndicate.

1540
01:02:38.967 --> 01:02:41.553
so stick to the list.
We're not here to browse.

1541
01:02:42.637 --> 01:02:43.805
(Megamind laughs)

1542
01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:45.432
- (laughs)
- (clattering)

1543
01:02:45.473 --> 01:02:47.434
* Everything City.
where you feel like a king *

1544
01:02:47.475 --> 01:02:49.644
- Whoa! Ooh...
- * If we don't have it *

1545
01:02:49.686 --> 01:02:51.312
- Ahem!
- * It's not a thing *

1546
01:02:51.354 --> 01:02:54.441
No thermal lasers.
No giant robot suits.

1547
01:02:54.482 --> 01:02:56.317
No polarity reversers.

1548
01:02:56.359 --> 01:02:59.779
Oh. nose hair clippers!
Crisis averted!

1549
01:02:59.821 --> 01:03:03.366

1550

1552

* Everything City. where
we'll make your heart sing *

1553
01:03:13.168 --> 01:03:16.546
That's just about everything.
Now. just need tennis balls.

1554
01:03:17.464 --> 01:03:18.715
All of them.

1555

1557
01:03:25.805 --> 01:03:27.974
Oh. excuse me.
I'm looking for a parakeet.

1558
01:03:28.016 --> 01:03:30.477
It's a gift of appreciation
for a friend.

1559
01:03:30.518 --> 01:03:33.396
Oh. I've got just the one. sir.

1560
01:03:33.438 --> 01:03:34.564
I give you.

1561
01:03:34.606 --> 01:03:36.733
- Mephistopheles...
- (angelic music playing)

1562
01:03:36.775 --> 01:03:39.694
...the parakeet of the gods.

1563
01:03:39.736 --> 01:03:41.863
Ah!

01:04:02.092 --> 01:04:04.803
Um. how will you
be paying today?

1572
01:04:05.345 --> 01:04:08.139
- Set to crème brûlée.
- (clicking. whooshes)

1573
01:04:08.181 --> 01:04:10.725
Uh. we'll put it on my card.

1574
01:04:11.226 --> 01:04:14.562
Oh. right!
Paying for things. (laughs)

1575
01:04:14.604 --> 01:04:18.358
Whoever came up with that
scheme is a real evil genius.

1576
01:04:19.567 --> 01:04:20.568
(scanner beeps)

1577
01:04:21.152 --> 01:04:22.946
Nighty-Knight:
The darkness fades to light.

1578
01:04:22.987 --> 01:04:25.699
and I have failed to
breach the entrance.

1579
01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.033
I have failed.

1580
01:04:27.075 --> 01:04:30.245
- I have failed!
- (clangs)

01:04:30.286 --> 01:04:30.995

1582
01:04:31.371 --> 01:04:34.457
Good news. everyone.
We're in.

1583
01:04:34.499 --> 01:04:36.459
It's about time!
(grunts)

1584
01:04:36.501 --> 01:04:40.505
(all grunting. straining)

1585
01:04:42.048 --> 01:04:44.217
- (tense music playing)
- (groaning)

1586
01:04:44.259 --> 01:04:45.552
Say what you will
about Megamind.

1587
01:04:45.593 --> 01:04:48.138
but he's always made
things user-friendly.

1588
01:04:48.179 --> 01:04:50.140
Nighty-Knight:
Whoa! Not so fast.

1589
01:04:50.181 --> 01:04:53.018
- Who said you could press it?
- I'm the leader!

1590
01:04:53.059 --> 01:04:55.979
Are we really gonna
keep arguing this point?

1591
01:04:56.021 --> 01:04:58.189
- We are!
- Nighty-Knight: We gotta figure this out

1592
01:04:58.231 --> 01:05:00.984
if we're gonna live on the
dark side of the moon together.

1593
01:05:01.026 --> 01:05:02.235
Megamind (on speakers):
Ollo!

1594
01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:04.696
Let me guess.
Leadership squabble?

1595
01:05:04.738 --> 01:05:06.448
Zombie Megamind!

1596
01:05:06.489 --> 01:05:09.492
Obviously he's not dead.
rocks for brains!

1597
01:05:09.534 --> 01:05:12.912
But. he is just in time to
see us complete the job

1598
01:05:12.954 --> 01:05:14.956
he wasn't evil enough
to finish.

1599
01:05:15.832 --> 01:05:17.083
(alarm blaring)

1600
01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:18.960
Computer:
Launch sequence initiated.

1601
01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:21.296
Five minutes to ignition.

1602
01:05:21.338 --> 01:05:23.506
Perfect amount of time to
bring you four to justice

1603
01:05:23.548 --> 01:05:26.509
and still be able to microwave
some pop-ed corn.

1604
01:05:26.551 --> 01:05:30.263
Nighty-Knight:
You really think you can go toe-to-toe with us alone?

1605
01:05:30.555 --> 01:05:33.808
Whoopsie. Not alone.
(imitates buzzer) You lose.

1606
01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:36.603
Oh! It's Megamind's evil bride!

1607
01:05:36.644 --> 01:05:38.355
Not evil. not a bride.

1608
01:05:38.396 --> 01:05:42.359
That was an act we decided on.
Together... sorta.

1609
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.236
But. obviously. zere
is some romantic tension

1610
01:05:45.278 --> 01:05:48.114
- between you two. no?
- Both: It's complicated.

1611
01:05:48.156 --> 01:05:50.784
Guys. do I have to
villain-splain

1612
01:05:50.825 --> 01:05:52.118
everything to you?

1613
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.537
They're obviously here
to stop the launch!

1614
01:05:54.579 --> 01:05:55.789
Get 'em!

1615
01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:57.540

Okay. Just gotta press
the button and stop the launch.

1626
01:06:22.524 --> 01:06:23.400
No need for alarm.

- Huh? The alarm!

1628

1721
01:09:55.737 --> 01:09:58.281
Gotta say.
not a fan of Phase Two!

1722
01:09:58.323 --> 01:10:00.033
In theory. it was amazing.

1723
01:10:00.075 --> 01:10:02.535
- In practice. kinda horrifying.

1724

(rockets roaring)

1728

- Help! Outta my way! Me first!
- (yelps)

1729
01:10:19.844 --> 01:10:22.722
- What are we supposed
to do now?! - Where am I gonna go?!

- What's going on?

01:10:28.728 --> 01:10:31.314
- Mr. Mayor. what's your plan?
- I'm sorry!

1734
01:10:31.356 --> 01:10:33.400
I didn't know I needed
an actual plan

1735
01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:35.610
for the city
launching into space!

1736
01:10:35.652 --> 01:10:37.821
Someone clearly
needs to take charge!

1737

That's supposed to be you!

I got a really important
lunch meeting. Gotta go!

(all screaming)

1741
01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:52.585
Everyone. please
try and calm down!

1742

Have your officers
dissolve panic

1749
01:11:08.643 --> 01:11:11.312
and steer people indoors
or underground.

1750
01:11:11.688 --> 01:11:13.064

- Paramedics.

1752
01:11:14.983 --> 01:11:17.944
Also. be prepared to
distribute air sickness pills

in large quantities.

1754
01:11:19.612 --> 01:11:22.282

I already barfed twice.

1761

This is the end of the line
for you. Megamind!

You all do know we're plunging
toward the earth right now?

1785
01:12:42.404 --> 01:12:44.864
Do not try to confuse us
with science.

The article states that
an outgoing evil leader

can only be terminated
by the new evil leader.

1794

we can put differences aside

01:17:03.331 --> 01:17:05.959
I'm sorry.
Was I interrupting something?

1887
01:17:06.543 --> 01:17:07.794
My hero.

1888
01:17:07.836 --> 01:17:09.838
(triumphant music playing)

1889
01:17:09.879 --> 01:17:12.132
- (gasps) Behind you!
- (whooshing)

1890
01:17:12.173 --> 01:17:15.343
- (Nighty-Knight laughs)
- (smoke hissing)

1891
01:17:16.678 --> 01:17:18.138
Nighty-Knight:
How's this for scary?

1892
01:17:18.179 --> 01:17:19.472
(gasps)

1893
01:17:19.514 --> 01:17:21.766
Leadership. here I come.

1894
01:17:21.808 --> 01:17:24.310
Hey. tall. dark.
and trying too hard.

1895
01:17:24.352 --> 01:17:25.562
**

1896
01:17:25.603 --> 01:17:27.522
Nighty-Knight:
Huh? What's that?

1897
01:17:27.564 --> 01:17:30.734
Either a paperweight
or a flash grenade.

1898
01:17:30.775 --> 01:17:32.694
- (zaps)
- (Nighty-Knight gasps. groans)

1899
01:17:32.736 --> 01:17:35.488
- (metal crashing)
- (toy squeaks)

1900
01:17:35.530 --> 01:17:37.407
Nighty. night. Nighty-Knight.

1901
01:17:37.949 --> 01:17:40.660
Huh. Guess it was
a flash grenade.

1902
01:17:40.702 --> 01:17:43.997
You are 100% going up
on my inspiration board.

1903
01:17:44.039 --> 01:17:45.665
- (rumbling)
- (all yelp)

1904
01:17:45.707 --> 01:17:47.792
No time for laurel resting.
Let's go!

1905
01:17:47.834 --> 01:17:49.502
(dramatic music playing)

1906
01:17:49.544 --> 01:17:52.839
(air rushing)

1907
01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:55.216
- Computer:
Reaching terminal velocity. - (alarm blaring)

1908
01:17:55.258 --> 01:17:59.429
(straining)
The retro rocket lever is jammed! (grunts)

1909
01:17:59.471 --> 01:18:01.431
I can't do this alone!

1910
01:18:01.473 --> 01:18:03.224
Megamind:
Nor will you have to.

1911
01:18:04.309 --> 01:18:06.019
This is a team effort.

1912
01:18:06.061 --> 01:18:08.271
- Hup!
- (Go Fish Gang member grunts)

1913
01:18:08.313 --> 01:18:09.856
(all straining)

1914
01:18:09.898 --> 01:18:11.983
Megamind:
We need more mega-muscle!

1915
01:18:12.025 --> 01:18:14.569
Computer: Warning. warning.
Impact is imminent.

1916
01:18:14.611 --> 01:18:17.655
Ground's approaching fast!
(straining)

1917
01:18:17.697 --> 01:18:19.616
Megamind:
Almost there!

1918
01:18:19.657 --> 01:18:21.534
Computer:
Warning. warning...

1919
01:18:21.576 --> 01:18:23.203
Just a little more!

1920
01:18:23.244 --> 01:18:25.872
- (warning continues)
- (Polly cawing)

1921
01:18:25.914 --> 01:18:28.249
- Computer: Warning...
- (all yell)

1922
01:18:28.291 --> 01:18:31.378
(rockets humming)

1923
01:18:31.419 --> 01:18:34.756
(rockets blasting)

1924
01:18:36.299 --> 01:18:38.176
- (thuds)
- (dust flying)

1925
01:18:38.218 --> 01:18:39.552
(all shouting)

1926
01:18:39.594 --> 01:18:41.054
Computer:
City landed.

1927
01:18:41.096 --> 01:18:43.348
Thank you for flying with us.

1928
01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:45.809
(relieved sighs)

1929
01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:48.228
You saved the city again. Sir.

1930
01:18:48.269 --> 01:18:50.563
No. we did.

1931
01:18:50.605 --> 01:18:52.899
**

1932
01:18:52.941 --> 01:18:55.402
- Sorry about your body. Chum.
- That's okay.

1933
01:18:55.443 --> 01:18:58.488
{\an8}- Still got a few spares
in the closet. - (car horn honking)

1934
01:18:58.530 --> 01:19:00.907
- (tires squeal)
- Roxanne: Oh. would you look at that.

1935
01:19:00.949 --> 01:19:02.659
- (car doors open)
- After the city's already saved.

1936
01:19:02.701 --> 01:19:04.994
here comes the mayor
to take all the credit.

1937
01:19:05.036 --> 01:19:07.122
Or he just wants to
give me another award.

1938
01:19:07.163 --> 01:19:10.709
Award?! After what you
just did to the city?

1939
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:12.502
Hardly a building
damaged this time.

1940
01:19:12.544 --> 01:19:13.795
We're getting good at this.

1941
01:19:13.837 --> 01:19:15.547
Are you kidding?!

1942
01:19:15.588 --> 01:19:18.883
(echoing)
You put the city backwards! Backwards... Backwards...

1943
01:19:19.217 --> 01:19:21.302
Personally. I prefer
a mountain view.

1944
01:19:21.344 --> 01:19:24.681
- but I'll put it back later.
- Uh. just so you know.

1945
01:19:24.723 --> 01:19:26.766
we all risked our lives
to save the city

1946
01:19:26.808 --> 01:19:29.519
while you were
cowering from your job.

1947
01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:32.313
Oh. you think
you can do better?

1948
01:19:32.355 --> 01:19:34.482
I know I can.

1949
01:19:34.524 --> 01:19:35.734
Oh!

1950
01:19:35.775 --> 01:19:37.861
Um. (huffing) okay.

1951
01:19:37.902 --> 01:19:41.406
- (beeps)
- Just sent you my resume.

1952
01:19:41.448 --> 01:19:43.783
- (door shuts. car departs)
- Mayor Roxanne Ritchi.

1953
01:19:43.825 --> 01:19:45.577
I like the sound of that.

1954
01:19:46.036 --> 01:19:49.622
(energetic music playing)

1955
01:19:49.664 --> 01:19:52.917
(crowd cheering)

1956
01:19:54.002 --> 01:19:56.212
(Polly cawing)

1957
01:20:00.133 --> 01:20:03.970
We are ready to do thy bidding.
Your Majesty.

1958
01:20:04.012 --> 01:20:07.432
Okay. Okay.
I'm the mayor now. not royalty.

1959
01:20:07.474 --> 01:20:09.726
Forgive us. Your Excellency.

1960
01:20:09.768 --> 01:20:12.395
Got the exclusive
right here. Mega-fans.

1961
01:20:12.437 --> 01:20:13.772
Roxanne on the inside.

1962
01:20:13.813 --> 01:20:16.608
Megamind. Chum. and yours truly
on the outside.

1963
01:20:16.649 --> 01:20:18.276
And all of us working together

1964
01:20:18.318 --> 01:20:20.945
to keep Metrocity
safe from evil.

1965
01:20:20.987 --> 01:20:23.114
You're getting good
at this hero thing.

1966
01:20:23.156 --> 01:20:25.325
You know. I-I think I finally
learned the big difference

1967
01:20:25.367 --> 01:20:27.827
between being a hero
and being a villain.

1968
01:20:27.869 --> 01:20:28.870
What's that?

1969
01:20:28.912 --> 01:20:31.247
Bad guys look out
for themselves.

1970
01:20:31.289 --> 01:20:33.667
Heroes look out for each other.

1971
01:20:33.708 --> 01:20:37.504
Together. we'll be unstoppable.

1972
01:20:37.545 --> 01:20:40.507
Keiko. if you'll do the honor.

1973
01:20:40.548 --> 01:20:42.884
(excited squealing)

1974
01:20:43.843 --> 01:20:46.596
(triumphant music playing)

1975
01:20:48.598 --> 01:20:50.058
(Polly cawing)

1976
01:20:51.267 --> 01:20:54.854
Evil has finally met its match.

1977
01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:57.190
- (Polly cawing)
- (oil splats)

1978
01:20:57.232 --> 01:20:59.859
Ugh. you've gotta be
kidding me!

1979
01:20:59.901 --> 01:21:02.237
**

1980
01:21:03.446 --> 01:21:06.366
- (dramatic sting)
- I call this meeting to order.

1981
01:21:06.408 --> 01:21:08.743
As leader. I permit it.

1982
01:21:08.785 --> 01:21:12.038
No! Me leader!

1983
01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:15.125
- (wall smashing)
- Huh?

1984
01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:18.086
Suave Voice:
I must say. I commend you all for your efforts

1985
01:21:18.128 --> 01:21:20.338
against Megamind but. alas.

1986
01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:24.592
you lack the proper leadership
to get the job done.

1987
01:21:24.926 --> 01:21:26.052
Oh. really?

1988
01:21:26.094 --> 01:21:27.679
- (powers charging up)
- Ha!

1989
01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:31.224
- (zaps)
- (Pierre shrieks)

1990
01:21:31.266 --> 01:21:34.769
On second thought.
maybe change is a good thing.

1991
01:21:34.811 --> 01:21:37.022
Suave Voice:
So glad you've come around.

1992
01:21:37.063 --> 01:21:38.231
With my help.

1993
01:21:38.273 --> 01:21:40.900
our blue friend
will rue the day

1994
01:21:40.942 --> 01:21:42.694
he betrayed evil.

1995
01:21:42.736 --> 01:21:45.655
Nighty-Knight:
What makes you think you can take down Megamind

1996
01:21:45.697 --> 01:21:46.906
when we all couldn't?

1997
01:21:47.282 --> 01:21:49.617
Because I. Machiavillain.

1998
01:21:49.659 --> 01:21:53.830
am the evil genius who taught
Megamind everything he knows.

1999
01:21:53.872 --> 01:21:56.166
And I promise. our blue friend

2000
01:21:56.207 --> 01:21:59.753
will rue the day
he betrayed evil!

2001
01:21:59.794 --> 01:22:01.504
