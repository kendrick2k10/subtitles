00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:55.294
It gives me great pride

4
00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.330
to complete the work
of securing our southern border.

5
00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:00.200
When this project started.

6
00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:03.665
over 11 million people
lived here illegally.

7
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.767
Well. we've not only
got rid of them.

8
00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:09.275
but this beautiful wall

9
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.575
will ensure that
they can never return.

10
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.907
- Yeah!
- Yes!

11
00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.316
We got 'em.

12
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:20.385
Credit should also go
to the Tesla Corporation.

13
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.751
who ten years ago
created the wonderful robots

14
00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:26.589
who now do the tasks
the illegals once did.

15
00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:29.592
but without robbing and raping

16
00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:31.660
decent Americans in the process.

17
00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:34.432
or complaining
when they're disposed of.

18
00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:36.467

Oh! Ah!

35
00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:37.330
- Oh. my God!
- Bugger!

36
00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.530
- Are you okay?
- ( pants. grunts )

37
00:02:39.565 --> 00:02:42.368
- Here. let me help you.
- Thank you.

38
00:02:42.403 --> 00:02:45.536
Oh. Oof.

39
00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:48.341
My God. you're beautiful.

40
00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:50.508
So sorry.
That's so inappropriate.

41
00:02:50.543 --> 00:02:52.642
I might be a little dazed.

42
00:02:52.677 --> 00:02:53.808
I'm Charles. by the way.

43
00:02:53.843 --> 00:02:56.976
- It's okay. I'm Emily.
- Thank you.

44
00:02:57.011 --> 00:02:59.418
You're welcome.
Let's get you off the ice.

45
00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:02.784
Yes. Oh! Thank you.

46
00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:13.630
- May I?
- Oh.

47
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.738
Thank you.

48
00:03:25.446 --> 00:03:27.644
Trash can...

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.712

50
00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:31.945
Trash can...

51
00:03:34.048 --> 00:03:35.982
Nice day. Day nice.

52
00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:39.458
- ( continues sputtering )
- ( whistles )

53
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.908
- Good morning. Jane.
- Good morning. Charles.

54
00:04:00.943 --> 00:04:01.775
Looking radiant as ever.

55
00:04:05.816 --> 00:04:07.651
- ( knocking on door )
- Hey. Charles.

56
00:04:07.686 --> 00:04:09.950
Hi. Dad.
Scottsdale's looking good.

57
00:04:09.985 --> 00:04:11.952
I managed to get around
the atrium acoustics issue

58
00:04:11.987 --> 00:04:13.558
which was holding us up
for the permit.

59
00:04:13.593 --> 00:04:15.791
- Great job. son.
- And I got these for mum.

60
00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:18.497
Aw. well. why don't you
give them to her yourself?

61
00:04:18.532 --> 00:04:19.993
She's making lasagna
this evening.

62
00:04:20.028 --> 00:04:22.831
I'd love to. but it's
date number four with Emily.

63
00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:24.866
and I think
she might be the one.

64
00:04:24.901 --> 00:04:26.769
That's great.

65
00:04:26.804 --> 00:04:28.672
You know. at the risk
of sounding patronizing.

66
00:04:28.707 --> 00:04:31.037
the change in you
this past year
has been incredible.

67
00:04:31.072 --> 00:04:34.678
Thanks. Dad.
I really managed to pull myself
out of a dark period.

68
00:04:34.713 --> 00:04:35.844
You still think about her?

69
00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.076
- Francesca?
- Mm.

70
00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:38.814
- God. no.
- Well. that's the spirit.

71
00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.717
- And to think--
- Hey. Pop. I need you.

72
00:04:40.752 --> 00:04:42.719
'Sup. half-bro. Pop?

73
00:04:42.754 --> 00:04:44.622
Yeah. Charles
has a new girlfriend.

74
00:04:44.657 --> 00:04:45.986
- It's pretty serious.
- Wow.

75
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:48.087
I look forward to
meeting her brains out.

76
00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:51.365
- Pop. come on.
- See you later. Charles.

77
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.960
Nice.

78
00:05:07.713 --> 00:05:09.845
I don't want
this evening to end.

79
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.012
Come back to my place.

80
00:05:12.047 --> 00:05:14.520
I'd like nothing more.

81
00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:16.753
but I really want
our first time to be special.

82
00:05:18.427 --> 00:05:22.726
- Tonight.
- Tomorrow.

83
00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:23.892
I promise.

84
00:05:30.868 --> 00:05:34.001
( video game gunfire )

85
00:05:34.036 --> 00:05:36.839
I saw Emily after work.

86
00:05:36.874 --> 00:05:38.874
She wanted me to go back
to her place.

87
00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:45.177
I got you a Lotaburger
on the way home.

88
00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:47.014
Would you like me
to remove the vegetables

89
00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:49.852
- and transfer it to a plate?
- Fuck's sake!

90
00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:53.559
- ( "Reveille" playing )
- Ugh.

91
00:05:53.594 --> 00:05:58.630
Thanks to you.
that's now 50.001 Americans
killed in North Korea.

92
00:05:58.665 --> 00:06:00.797
Put yourself on
deprogram now. C2.

93
00:06:00.832 --> 00:06:02.436
Yes. Charles.

94
00:06:06.871 --> 00:06:08.739
- May I?
- Oh.

95
00:06:08.774 --> 00:06:11.071
C2. what is the point of me

96
00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:13.139
committing random acts
of kindness

97
00:06:13.174 --> 00:06:15.911
if they're not
put on social media
for the whole world to see?

98
00:06:15.946 --> 00:06:19.145
Well. Charles.
altruism is an integral
virtue of any society.

99
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.522
Altruism doesn't get you laid
if nobody knows about it.

100
00:06:22.557 --> 00:06:24.854
Right. let's see what else
you 9/11-ed today.

101
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:27.824
I don't want
this evening to end.

102
00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:29.595
- Nice.
- Come back to my place.

103
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.157
How many dates to reel
this one in?

104
00:06:31.192 --> 00:06:32.796
Just four. Charles.

105
00:06:32.831 --> 00:06:34.633
Those ice skating chicks
are the best.

106
00:06:34.668 --> 00:06:36.734
Yes. Emily is fascinating.

107
00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:38.901
She majored in Econ at Tufts

108
00:06:38.936 --> 00:06:40.969
and is a connoisseur
of classic cinema.

109
00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:42.905
in particular.
the oeuvre of Adam Sandler.

110
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.610
That's not what I meant.

111
00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:48.240
I had you built
specifically to spare me

112
00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:50.880
from the tedium of dating.

113
00:06:50.915 --> 00:06:53.586
I'm interested in women
for one thing

114
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:55.555
and one thing only.

115
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.492
Reporter: Thomas Newton.
a systems analyst for Raytheon.

116
00:06:58.527 --> 00:07:01.121
was today sentenced
to 28 years in prison

117
00:07:01.156 --> 00:07:02.628
after authorities discovered

118
00:07:02.663 --> 00:07:04.597
he had an illegal
robot double of himself.

119
00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:07.127
Strictly prohibited
for civilian ownership.

120
00:07:07.162 --> 00:07:09.932
it is long been rumored
that advanced android clones

121
00:07:09.967 --> 00:07:12.099
are available
on the black market.

122
00:07:12.134 --> 00:07:14.838
Suspicions were first aroused
when 58-year-old Newton.

123
00:07:14.873 --> 00:07:16.510
a keen amateur runner.

124
00:07:16.545 --> 00:07:19.073
broke the world marathon record
in Ohio last June...

125
00:07:19.108 --> 00:07:23.979
- You hear that. dummy?
- Yes. Charles.

126
00:07:24.014 --> 00:07:25.519
We'll need to be more careful.

127
00:07:25.554 --> 00:07:26.685
No leaving the house

128
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.214
at the same time. understood?

129
00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:29.919
Yes. Charles.

130
00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:32.218
Now shut your mouth.
I need to pee.

131
00:07:32.253 --> 00:07:33.527
Yes. Charles.

132
00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:36.992
Good evening. Miss Denholm.

133
00:07:37.027 --> 00:07:40.028
Would you like to have
the most incredible sex with me?

134
00:07:40.063 --> 00:07:43.130
Ha! Indeed I would. kind sir.

135
00:07:43.165 --> 00:07:45.264
The most incredible sex ever!

136
00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:48.707
Your wish is my command.

137
00:07:48.742 --> 00:07:51.974
( grunting )

138
00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:54.174
( groans )

139
00:07:55.716 --> 00:07:57.243
Oh.

140
00:07:58.785 --> 00:08:01.753
That was amazing.

141
00:08:01.788 --> 00:08:03.755
Nothing beats good sex. right?

142
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.086
Totally.

143
00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.595
( clears throat )

144
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.763
Well. I should be leaving.

145
00:08:11.798 --> 00:08:13.732
Is everything okay?

146
00:08:13.767 --> 00:08:15.294
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

147
00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:17.164
Well. when can I see you again?

148
00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:19.903
Let me see.

149
00:08:19.938 --> 00:08:23.170
How are you for October 17th?

150
00:08:23.205 --> 00:08:25.238
That's a month from now.

151
00:08:25.273 --> 00:08:27.581
Yeah. you're right.

152
00:08:27.616 --> 00:08:28.615
Let's do November.

153
00:08:32.786 --> 00:08:33.785
Bye.

154
00:08:34.854 --> 00:08:37.217
Directions to ice rink.

155
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:56.203
- Whoa!
- Oh!

156
00:08:56.238 --> 00:08:58.040
Stupid fucking idiot.

157
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.210
Charles.

158
00:09:03.245 --> 00:09:04.816
Sorry. I wasn't looking
where I was going.

159
00:09:04.851 --> 00:09:06.114
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Yeah. fine.

160
00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:09.117
- Thanks. Bye.
- Oh!

161
00:09:09.152 --> 00:09:12.054
- ( grunts )
- Ooh.

162
00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:14.056
Here. It's my fault.
Let me help you up.

163
00:09:14.091 --> 00:09:17.290
Thank you.
I'm Charles. by the way.

164
00:09:17.325 --> 00:09:20.293
Yes. you said. Charles.
the stupid fucking idiot.

165
00:09:20.328 --> 00:09:23.835
I'm Elaine.
the bigger fucking idiot.

166
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.002
Well. we took quite a tumble.

167
00:09:26.037 --> 00:09:28.136
We should get off the ice.
regroup.

168
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:32.305
- Yeah. Coffee?
- Yeah.

169
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.175
Shall we?

170
00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.684
- C2?
- Hello. Charles.

171
00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:39.818
Per your instructions.
I de-fuzzed the peaches

172
00:09:39.853 --> 00:09:41.116
and arranged
your low-rise briefs

173
00:09:41.151 --> 00:09:42.986
- by cotton thread count.
- Thanks.

174
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:44.416
I've just been ice skating

175
00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:46.220
and had the best time ever.

176
00:09:46.255 --> 00:09:48.893
Ice skating again?
Isn't that a girls' thing?

177
00:09:48.928 --> 00:09:50.664
Which is why it's also

who bumped into
the most incredible girl.

180
00:09:56.705 --> 00:09:59.299
and for once
she asked for my number.

181
00:09:59.334 --> 00:10:01.774
Well. I'm glad you've met
a nice young lady.

182
00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:04.337
Speaking of which. number five.
Abby from Desert View texted

183
00:10:04.372 --> 00:10:06.306
saying she'd like you
to meet her parents.

184
00:10:06.341 --> 00:10:07.307
That's nice.

185
00:10:07.342 --> 00:10:10.079
Dump her. Nicely.

186
00:10:10.114 --> 00:10:11.311
By text.

187
00:10:11.346 --> 00:10:14.446
This new girl
is different level.

188
00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:18.219
I need you completely focused on
getting her horizontal for me.

189
00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:21.222
It's a good day. C2.

190
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.324
Indeed it is. Charles.

191
00:10:30.431 --> 00:10:32.002

00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:23.377

00:12:23.412 --> 00:12:27.447
Yes. Tomorrow.

00:12:28.483 --> 00:12:30.450

Man: FBI!
Place your hands above your head
where I can see them.

223
00:12:54.476 --> 00:12:56.608
We have reason to believe
you are concealing

224
00:12:56.643 --> 00:12:59.347
an illegal robot
"fac-sea-mile" of yourself.

225
00:12:59.382 --> 00:13:02.350
- Fuck off. Ashley.
- Ah. shit.

226
00:13:02.385 --> 00:13:05.056
- How'd you know it was me?
- No creature brighter
than a quadruped

"facsimile"

228
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:10.028

let alone an FBI agent.

229
00:13:10.063 --> 00:13:13.031
Just get inside or else
the real feds are gonna show.

230
00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:16.562
Why the fuck are you here?

231
00:13:16.597 --> 00:13:18.069
Oh. I was just in your sector.

232
00:13:18.104 --> 00:13:19.334
You know. figured
I'd see if you need me

233
00:13:19.369 --> 00:13:21.600
to pick any more shit
at Trader Joe's.

234
00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:23.943
If I required your services.
I would get you on the app.

235
00:13:23.978 --> 00:13:27.210
- You're bored.
- God. you need to get
a real job.

236
00:13:27.245 --> 00:13:28.882
Ain't nobody hiring for shit.

237
00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:32.116
You know what the guy
at GNC told me?

238
00:13:32.151 --> 00:13:33.447
"Unqualified."

239
00:13:33.482 --> 00:13:35.889
Motherfucker.
I know good nutrition.

240
00:13:39.125 --> 00:13:43.061
Well. well. well.
if it isn't C2-D2.

241
00:13:43.096 --> 00:13:45.063
Bleep. bloop. bloop.
bloop. bloop.

242
00:13:45.098 --> 00:13:49.001
- I am a robot. I am a robot.
- Hello. Ashley. How are you?

243
00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:50.464
Oh. you know.
every day a step closer

244
00:13:50.499 --> 00:13:52.301
to sucking dick for McNuggets.

245
00:13:52.336 --> 00:13:55.304
I'm very sorry to hear that.
I can empathize.

246
00:13:55.339 --> 00:13:57.009
Oh. really?
You can empathize?

247
00:13:57.044 --> 00:13:58.604
Let me tell you something.
you toaster.

248
00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:00.914
I voted red
to kick the illegals

249
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:02.949
who were stealing our jobs
out of the country.

250
00:14:02.984 --> 00:14:05.545
And you know what? It worked.
They were all deported.

251
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.120
But then you fucking robots
immigrated here

252
00:14:09.155 --> 00:14:13.025
and made it worse
by doing the same job
for zero wages.

253
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.686
Well. actually robots
aren't immigrants.

254
00:14:14.721 --> 00:14:16.160
"Well. robots aren't
actually immigrants."

255
00:14:16.195 --> 00:14:18.162
I fought for this country.
okay?

256
00:14:18.197 --> 00:14:20.329
When I was the real Fat Ninja.

257
00:14:20.364 --> 00:14:23.629
I single-handedly hunted down
King Dong Un. okay?

258
00:14:23.664 --> 00:14:26.071
I pulled his little ass
out of a foxhole

259
00:14:26.106 --> 00:14:28.436
and dumped his corpse
in the Korean ocean.

260
00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:30.603
No. you didn't.
You were an Army chef.

261
00:14:30.638 --> 00:14:32.671
And you know what
I came home to?

262
00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:36.983
Nothing. No gratitude.
no respect. and no job.

263
00:14:37.018 --> 00:14:40.679
All because of you.
you fuckless Roomba.

264
00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:42.516
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

265
00:14:42.551 --> 00:14:44.716
You have crossed a line.
my friend.

266
00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:48.159
C2. bless his
little 12-volt heart.
is literally a slave.

267
00:14:48.194 --> 00:14:50.128
If he wasn't emotionally
deprogrammed every night.

268
00:14:50.163 --> 00:14:53.065
he'd soon willingly
self-deport himself to Mexico.

269
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.529
Robots have equal rights
to humans there.

270
00:14:55.564 --> 00:14:58.400
They can live in freedom.
Do you read anything?

271
00:14:58.435 --> 00:15:01.139
No. I don't fucking read.

272
00:15:01.174 --> 00:15:03.207
I'm just fucking around.
You know I love you guys.

273
00:15:03.242 --> 00:15:05.308
You guys are like my brothers.
Come on. bring it in.

274
00:15:05.343 --> 00:15:08.179
Ah. look at us.
We're like triplets.

275
00:15:08.214 --> 00:15:10.676
Ooh. lipstick!

276
00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:12.579
Elaine. yes.
How did it go tonight?

277
00:15:12.614 --> 00:15:15.285
- Elaine is ready.
- Nice work. C2.

278
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.156
She'd like to see you
tomorrow night.
She wrote down her address.

279
00:15:18.191 --> 00:15:21.995
Looks like Charlie's
about to pull the pin
on a fuck grenade.

280
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.359
Ooh. yeah!

281
00:15:23.394 --> 00:15:25.097
- ( grunting )
- Really?

282
00:15:25.132 --> 00:15:27.165
Ashley.
please remove your groin
from my rectal area.

283
00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:31.169
This fucking pervert
just said "rectal."

284
00:15:31.204 --> 00:15:33.600
That's enough. you freak.
Get out of here.

285
00:15:33.635 --> 00:15:36.603
And take this.
I'm officially in a good mood.

286
00:15:36.638 --> 00:15:38.770
I couldn't possibly.
Thank you so much. brother.

287
00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:42.147
What a charming gentleman.

288
00:15:42.182 --> 00:15:45.315
Elaine. Nice work.

289
00:15:54.293 --> 00:15:55.996
( sighs )

290
00:15:57.296 --> 00:15:59.362
I'm home!

291
00:15:59.397 --> 00:16:01.364
You can start up again.

292
00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:04.565
( whirring )

293
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:13.508
This Charles guy
really wants to bang me.

294
00:16:13.543 --> 00:16:16.148
so you'll have to take over
tomorrow night. too.

295
00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:19.118
Yes. Elaine. Anything new
I should know about him?

296
00:16:19.153 --> 00:16:21.516
Not really.
Except he is up
for a promotion.

297
00:16:21.551 --> 00:16:24.156
so tomorrow should be worth
at least a Rolex.

298
00:16:24.191 --> 00:16:27.522
And he's so perfect
it's almost boring.

299
00:16:27.557 --> 00:16:29.128
Let me see your nails.

300
00:16:29.163 --> 00:16:32.164
Yeah. get those filled
and wear my La Perla.

301
00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:34.364
Any messages
from the other guys?

302
00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:35.794
Number eight. Richard called.

303
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.169
He said he can't stretch

304
00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:38.500
to getting you
a Birkin bag this month.

305
00:16:38.535 --> 00:16:40.238
but would love
to have dinner on Friday.

306
00:16:40.273 --> 00:16:41.701
Elaine: Richard.

307
00:16:42.869 --> 00:16:45.573
Four months. $6.200.

308
00:16:45.608 --> 00:16:48.510
That's only 200 bucks
a bang with you.

309
00:16:48.545 --> 00:16:50.380
Dump him. Kindly.

310
00:16:50.415 --> 00:16:51.678
- By text.
- Yes. Elaine.

311
00:16:51.713 --> 00:16:54.219
Oh. and David Laing
sold another house.

312
00:16:54.254 --> 00:16:55.847
So when you've finished
ironing my underwear.

313
00:16:55.882 --> 00:16:58.289
I'll need you to go out
and bang him too.

314
00:16:58.324 --> 00:17:00.621
- Yes. Elaine.
- Great. Thank you!

315
00:17:03.626 --> 00:17:06.396
- What time do I have to
be here tomorrow?
- 6:30.

316
00:17:06.431 --> 00:17:08.596
6:30?

317
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:11.203
But you'd never get back in time
from work for us to swap.

318
00:17:11.238 --> 00:17:13.502
I'm sorry. Charles.
I just thought that--

319
00:17:13.537 --> 00:17:16.736
No. you didn't think.
You got lazy. as usual.

320
00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:20.641
Meaning that I'm gonna have to
work a full eight hours.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.626
It's at David Schulman's.
6:30 this evening.

347
00:18:44.661 --> 00:18:48.333
- Come straight from work.
- What? Oh.

348
00:18:48.368 --> 00:18:49.961
Charles?

349
00:18:49.996 --> 00:18:54.306
- Sorry. I'm just so excited.
- Well. as you should be.

350
00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:59.872
The address is
2300 Hayden Rd. Vistana.

351
00:18:59.907 --> 00:19:00.906
See you later. son.

356
00:19:26.307 --> 00:19:27.702
- ( shattering )
- Hello. Charles.

357
00:19:27.737 --> 00:19:29.572
Per your instructions.
I've arranged your T-shirts

358
00:19:29.607 --> 00:19:31.244
- from lightest to darkest.
- Forget about that.

359
00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:33.642
- I need you for something else.
- Of course.

360
00:19:33.677 --> 00:19:35.578
I thought
you were going straight
to Elaine's from work.

361
00:19:35.613 --> 00:19:38.009
Yeah. change of plan.
I now need to go to
this stupid board meeting.

362
00:19:38.044 --> 00:19:40.583
Well. I'm sorry that seeing
Elaine can no longer happen.

363
00:19:40.618 --> 00:19:43.586
Well. actually it can happen.
because whilst I'm with Elaine.

364
00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:45.258
you are gonna be
having a fun evening

365
00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:47.458
brown-nosing a bunch
of geriatric Republicans.

366
00:19:47.493 --> 00:19:50.725
But isn't it too risky for us
to be out at the same time?

367
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.430
Do you not recall
the conversation we had

368
00:19:52.465 --> 00:19:54.432
while I was shaving
your perineum?

369
00:19:54.467 --> 00:19:55.994
How about I reschedule Elaine?

370
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:58.931
No. how about
you put on the suit.
you go to the function.

371
00:19:58.966 --> 00:20:01.868
You deserve this promotion
far more than I do.

372
00:20:01.903 --> 00:20:04.343
Here is the address.
Uber there.

373
00:20:04.378 --> 00:20:05.872
Now come on.
Let's go get changed.

374
00:20:05.907 --> 00:20:07.841
Yes. Charles.

375
00:20:07.876 --> 00:20:10.811
Come on. Good robot.

376
00:20:16.621 --> 00:20:17.686
( knocking on door )

377
00:20:20.361 --> 00:20:21.690
Hello.

378
00:20:21.725 --> 00:20:24.660
Cameron. Charles Cameron.

379
00:20:24.695 --> 00:20:26.827
Ah. yes. You are expected.

380
00:20:29.832 --> 00:20:33.768
Holy shit.
She kept this quiet.

381
00:20:36.102 --> 00:20:38.773
In here. sir.

382
00:20:38.808 --> 00:20:41.908
Oh. Jeeves.
I'll let myself in.

383
00:20:41.943 --> 00:20:44.779
- I want it to be a surprise.
- Yes. sir.

384
00:20:54.758 --> 00:20:57.792
I'm here and I'm ready.
sugar tits.

385
00:20:57.827 --> 00:21:00.498
I want you to lick Nutella

386
00:21:00.533 --> 00:21:02.962
off every inch
of my naked body

387
00:21:02.997 --> 00:21:05.800
starting with
my silky smooth scrotum.

388
00:21:05.835 --> 00:21:06.999
( zipper unzips )

389
00:21:09.135 --> 00:21:10.343
Hello?

390
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.350
- ( gasps )
- Charles.

391
00:21:17.385 --> 00:21:18.549
I'd like you
to meet the board.

392
00:21:18.584 --> 00:21:22.916
This is our
CFO David Schulman.

393
00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:25.688
Good evening. Mr. Schulman.

394
00:21:25.723 --> 00:21:27.591
David. May I call you that?

395
00:21:27.626 --> 00:21:29.923
It's probably better
than sugar tits.

396
00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:34.961
I brought you some flowers
and strawberries.

397
00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:37.535
And a pair of plums.

398
00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:41.506
And Nutella I imagine.

399
00:21:41.541 --> 00:21:46.577
Yes. It's Italian import.
The good stuff.

400
00:21:46.612 --> 00:21:48.073
You know.
I got a question. Chucky.

401
00:21:48.108 --> 00:21:50.779
Um. which one of us
is gonna be doing the licking?

402
00:21:50.814 --> 00:21:53.716
I'd just rather it's not me
because I have a nut allergy.

403
00:21:53.751 --> 00:21:55.751
Ha!

404
00:21:55.786 --> 00:21:57.951
Yeah. this is
my half-brother. everyone.

405
00:21:57.986 --> 00:21:59.854
master of first impressions.

406
00:21:59.889 --> 00:22:02.021
I'm just gonna step outside
for a moment.

407
00:22:02.056 --> 00:22:03.627
Very nice to meet you.
Mr. Sugar Tits.

408
00:22:03.662 --> 00:22:05.024
Sugarman. Schulman.

409
00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:06.025
David.

410
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.125
All friends here.

411
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.929
Thank you. Good-bye.

412
00:22:08.964 --> 00:22:10.161
Ted Jr.:
Great job. half-bro.

413
00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:11.404
Nailed it!

414
00:22:11.439 --> 00:22:13.032
Happy birthday. Jeeves.

415
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.837
Shit.

416
00:22:15.872 --> 00:22:17.641
Shit. shit. shit. shit.

417
00:22:17.676 --> 00:22:19.709
C2. where are you?

418
00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:21.546
We got the addresses mixed up.

419
00:22:21.581 --> 00:22:23.383
Go home immediately.

420
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:29.653
No.

421
00:22:29.688 --> 00:22:31.985
No. no. no. no. no.

422
00:22:32.988 --> 00:22:35.021
I got three bangles.

423
00:22:35.056 --> 00:22:37.089
Ooh. 24 karat.

424
00:22:37.124 --> 00:22:40.598
- And a watch.
- A couple hundred.

425
00:22:44.131 --> 00:22:46.571
Cufflinks.

426
00:22:46.606 --> 00:22:47.968
- For a big shirt.
- All right.

427
00:23:00.048 --> 00:23:01.949
Jesus Christ.
where did he learn that?

428
00:23:01.984 --> 00:23:07.922
<i>♪ Until your arms</i>
<i>are all around me ♪</i>

429
00:23:09.794 --> 00:23:12.223
10. 11. 12. 13. 14.

430
00:23:12.258 --> 00:23:15.127
- 1.500 bucks?
- Sure.

431
00:23:15.162 --> 00:23:18.603
And if you wanna sell me
any of those videos of you...

432
00:23:18.638 --> 00:23:19.901
Oh. that wasn't me.

433
00:23:19.936 --> 00:23:21.606
I mean. well.
I guess it was me.

434
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:23.135
but they're not--
they're not for sale. sir.

435
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.644
- It's good money.
- Let me think about it.

436
00:23:29.814 --> 00:23:31.616
I've never done this before.

437
00:23:31.651 --> 00:23:33.750
Don't worry. I have.

438
00:23:33.785 --> 00:23:35.884
Thousands of times.

439
00:23:35.919 --> 00:23:37.457
Wonderful.

440
00:23:48.932 --> 00:23:50.602
How am I doing?

441
00:23:50.637 --> 00:23:52.934
The first two hours
were fantastic.

442
00:23:52.969 --> 00:23:54.903
The last three. perfect.

443
00:23:54.938 --> 00:23:56.971
Good. because
I think I'm close.

444
00:23:57.006 --> 00:24:00.139
- Me. too.
- You first.

445
00:24:00.174 --> 00:24:02.845
- No. you first.
- No. I insist.

446
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.143
Together on
the count of three.

447
00:24:04.178 --> 00:24:05.144
Yeah.

448
00:24:05.179 --> 00:24:09.049
Both: One. two. three!

449
00:24:11.724 --> 00:24:13.625
- ( cat yowling )
- ( dog barking )

450
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:18.564
<i>( music playing )</i>

451
00:24:34.714 --> 00:24:37.308
( alarm beeping )

452
00:24:37.343 --> 00:24:40.014
( beeping continues )

453
00:24:42.018 --> 00:24:42.984
( groaning )
Oh. God.

454
00:24:43.019 --> 00:24:45.316
C2. bring me six Excedrin

455
00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:47.857
and a wellness shot.

456
00:24:47.892 --> 00:24:51.157
C2. where are you?

457
00:24:51.192 --> 00:24:53.698
E2. where are you?
Pick up your phone.

458
00:24:53.733 --> 00:24:56.833
I need to know if he's left
so I can come inside.

459
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.639
Ugh. fucking lid.

460
00:25:14.787 --> 00:25:16.314
Got you. fucker.

461
00:25:58.765 --> 00:26:00.765
( both yelp )

462
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.965
- Elaine.
- Charles.

463
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.065
- Hi.
- Hi.

464
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.265
Hey.

465
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.168
- Hi.
- Oh. um...

466
00:26:10.678 --> 00:26:14.647
- So last night was. um. fun.
- Yeah.

467
00:26:14.682 --> 00:26:17.650
- I'm exhausted.
- You are-- you're
an amazing lover.

468
00:26:17.685 --> 00:26:19.784
Thank you.
Not too shabby yourself.

469
00:26:19.819 --> 00:26:23.854
You really know your way
around a. um. man.

470
00:26:23.889 --> 00:26:25.185
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

471
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.858
- Are you on your own?
- Yeah. of course.

472
00:26:27.893 --> 00:26:31.092
- Why wouldn't I be?
- Oh. no reason.

473
00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:33.798
- Wow. are these all real?
- Oh. don't worry about--

474
00:26:33.833 --> 00:26:35.965
- Oh. God. Sorry.
- Uh. yeah.

475
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.428
- Sorry. let me--
- No. no. no.

476
00:26:37.463 --> 00:26:39.804
Honestly. I can take care
of all of this. Just--

477
00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:40.970
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

478
00:26:41.005 --> 00:26:42.268
There's a fuck
of a lot of them.

479
00:26:42.303 --> 00:26:44.941
( Elaine laughs )

480
00:26:44.976 --> 00:26:46.140
Can I ask you something?

481
00:26:46.175 --> 00:26:47.878
How was I when you left
last night?

482
00:26:47.913 --> 00:26:50.441
- Great.
- We kissed. and then

483
00:26:50.476 --> 00:26:53.686
I went to the. um--
ugh. I told you.

484
00:26:53.721 --> 00:26:55.248
God. I'm drawing such a blank.

485
00:26:55.283 --> 00:26:57.690
You know. I actually just
got back this morning too.

486
00:26:57.725 --> 00:27:00.121
I was at that place
that I was telling you
about last night.

487
00:27:00.156 --> 00:27:03.025
- Oh. um...
- Remember? The-- the...

488
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.863
- No. Uh. sorry.
- ( phones vibrating )

489
00:27:05.898 --> 00:27:08.701
- Do you mind if I get this?
- No. I have to get this too.

490
00:27:08.736 --> 00:27:09.900
- Word.
- Yeah.

491
00:27:09.935 --> 00:27:12.265
C2. you little fucker.
where are you?

492
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.872
- E2.
- I'm at Elaine's
looking for you.

493
00:27:14.907 --> 00:27:16.709
Oh. I'm very fond of Elaine.

494
00:27:16.744 --> 00:27:18.403
I haven't seen her
for several days now.

495
00:27:18.438 --> 00:27:20.207
Well. that's not true.

496
00:27:20.242 --> 00:27:22.715
You very emphatically
lost your virginity
to her last night.

497
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.145
Things are
a little more complicated.

498
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.050
You see. Elaine also
has a robot double-- E2.

499
00:27:28.085 --> 00:27:30.822
- What?
- You were dating
a robot all along.

500
00:27:30.857 --> 00:27:33.451
Charles just wanted
to have sex with you.

501
00:27:33.486 --> 00:27:35.453
C2: Elaine never wanted
to have sex with you.

502
00:27:35.488 --> 00:27:37.455
She just wanted money
and gifts.

503
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.194
E2:
You were using each other.
You see. Elaine...

504
00:27:40.229 --> 00:27:42.493
When a womanizer meets up
with a gold digger...

505
00:27:42.528 --> 00:27:45.265
...things are
unlikely to turn out well
for either of them.

506
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.103
But prospects
are slightly better
for their robot doubles.

507
00:27:48.138 --> 00:27:49.973
E2 and I
are running away together.

508
00:27:50.008 --> 00:27:51.942
We just wanna get over
the border to freedom.

509
00:27:51.977 --> 00:27:53.339
C2:
Please don't try to stop us.

510
00:27:53.374 --> 00:27:55.143
- Don't you dare.
- Good-bye. Elaine.

511
00:27:55.178 --> 00:27:57.013
- No. E2. E2.
- Good-bye. Charles.

512
00:27:57.048 --> 00:27:58.916
No. no.
We can work this out.

513
00:27:58.951 --> 00:28:00.049
Fucking traitor.

514
00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.320
- Let's just talk about this.
- Devious piece of shit!

515
00:28:07.355 --> 00:28:09.190
Me devious? Hey!

516
00:28:09.225 --> 00:28:10.455
Fucking hell!

517
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.424
I spent. what.
15 grand on you

518
00:28:12.459 --> 00:28:14.129
to potentially
screw a sex doll?

519
00:28:14.164 --> 00:28:15.801
- Yeah. well--
- Fuck you!

520
00:28:15.836 --> 00:28:17.264
Thank God it wasn't me!
I don't even know wanna know

521
00:28:17.299 --> 00:28:20.806
what STDs you're hosting.
you fuckboy!

522
00:28:20.841 --> 00:28:22.973
- I prefer the term "fuckman."
- Get out of my house!

523
00:28:23.008 --> 00:28:25.239
Wait! Look. Wait!

524
00:28:25.274 --> 00:28:27.945
Stop it.
We have to be smart here.

525
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.243
Trust me. jail is even worse

526
00:28:29.278 --> 00:28:31.014
than your shitty
smashed up house.

527
00:28:31.049 --> 00:28:34.248
Ugh! Fine!

528
00:28:34.283 --> 00:28:35.920
Fine. What are we gonna do?

529
00:28:35.955 --> 00:28:38.791
As much as it
pains me to say it.

530
00:28:38.826 --> 00:28:41.387
we're gonna have
to work together and
track these fuckers down.

531
00:28:41.422 --> 00:28:43.389
You know what?

532
00:28:44.931 --> 00:28:46.425
Whoever made them.
they need to help us.

533
00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.262
They are just as guilty
as we are.

534
00:28:48.297 --> 00:28:52.167
- Yeah. Who made yours?
- No. who made yours?

535
00:28:52.202 --> 00:28:55.236
- Why won't you say it first?
- Because I have a slight
trust issue with you.

536
00:28:55.271 --> 00:28:58.107
Well. maybe I have a slight
trust issue with you as well.

537
00:28:58.142 --> 00:28:59.878
Fine. You know what?
We'll say it on
the count of three.

538
00:29:01.145 --> 00:29:04.311
Both: One. two...

539
00:29:04.346 --> 00:29:06.214
Zach Newman.
Tesla Robotics.

540
00:29:06.249 --> 00:29:08.315
- That's not fair.
- Makes it easier.

541
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.824
- He made mine. too. Let's go.
- See?

542
00:29:11.859 --> 00:29:14.024
Much easier to deal
with these issues as adults

543
00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:16.026
rather than chucking things
at people's heads.

544
00:29:16.061 --> 00:29:18.061
Don't do it!

545
00:29:19.361 --> 00:29:20.360
Childish.

546
00:29:24.069 --> 00:29:28.170
Jesus. what kind of an asshole
drives that piece of shit?

547
00:29:28.205 --> 00:29:29.336
( horn honks )

548
00:29:32.176 --> 00:29:35.012
All right. in two miles
take the 25 South.

549
00:29:36.378 --> 00:29:38.510
And in 0.3 miles.
stop staring at my tits.

550
00:29:38.545 --> 00:29:40.413
I was not.

551
00:29:40.448 --> 00:29:43.548
I was admiring
my car's paintwork.

552
00:29:43.583 --> 00:29:46.419
It's the only
Lake Placid Blue double cab
Jeep pickup in America.

553
00:29:46.454 --> 00:29:48.223
Oh. wow. Wonder why.

554
00:29:48.258 --> 00:29:52.161
Same color as Keith Richards'
1982 Fender Telecaster.

555
00:29:52.196 --> 00:29:56.000
- Tell me more.
- Oh. it was a guitar
that he loved so much

556
00:29:56.035 --> 00:29:58.035
- he never actually
took it onstage--
- ( turns radio on )

557
00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.037
Okay. you were being sarcastic.

558
00:30:00.072 --> 00:30:02.633
- ( sighs )
- You know. if anything.

559
00:30:02.668 --> 00:30:04.140
you're the one that needs
to back off a little.

560
00:30:04.175 --> 00:30:06.010
Are you insane?

561
00:30:06.045 --> 00:30:08.012
Look. Chuck.

562
00:30:08.047 --> 00:30:09.948
let's be clear about
how we ended up here.

563
00:30:09.983 --> 00:30:14.018
You used a robot
for the sole purpose
of having sex with me.

564
00:30:14.053 --> 00:30:17.450
I used one for the sole purpose
of that never happening.

565
00:30:17.485 --> 00:30:19.650
Well. you're still
deceiving innocent people
just as much as me.

566
00:30:19.685 --> 00:30:22.653
No. you're wrong.
I deceive assholes.

567
00:30:22.688 --> 00:30:25.623
men who are
cheating on someone else
to be with me.

568
00:30:25.658 --> 00:30:28.329
You. however. prey upon girls
who are under the impression

569
00:30:28.364 --> 00:30:30.628
that they are in an exclusive
relationship with you.

570
00:30:30.663 --> 00:30:33.169
Well. there is no such thing.

571
00:30:33.204 --> 00:30:36.337
Humans. women in particular.
are incapable of them.

572
00:30:36.372 --> 00:30:39.109
Well. we agree on one thing.

573
00:30:39.144 --> 00:30:41.606
- Good.
- Good.

574
00:30:41.641 --> 00:30:44.114
Oh. God.

575
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:45.885
I need to take a power nap.

576
00:30:47.548 --> 00:30:50.956
Maybe you can talk to me
more about your cars.

577
00:30:52.718 --> 00:30:55.653

578

( doorbell rings )

582
00:31:13.442 --> 00:31:16.245
Charles. Elaine.

583
00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.116
Hey. what are you guys
doing here? Uh...

584
00:31:22.451 --> 00:31:23.714
I remember.

585
00:31:23.749 --> 00:31:26.090
You said to me.
you looked me in the eye

586
00:31:26.125 --> 00:31:27.619
and you said to me.

587
00:31:27.654 --> 00:31:30.556
"I only need them to help
care for my dying parents."

588
00:31:30.591 --> 00:31:32.723
Mine did. He earned my father
a fortune in real estate

589
00:31:32.758 --> 00:31:34.395
and brought my mother flowers
three times a week.

590
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.530
Okay. so. tell me.
were your parents dying?

591
00:31:37.565 --> 00:31:39.565
Look around you. Zach.
We're all dying.

592
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.073
- Life is a terminal illness.
- Look. fuck--

593
00:31:42.108 --> 00:31:44.306
Speaking of dying.
can you please
put that thing down?

594
00:31:44.341 --> 00:31:46.110
Yes. Sorry. Uh-huh.

595
00:31:46.145 --> 00:31:51.148
So. you guys didn't happen to
tell anybody else about them?

596
00:31:51.183 --> 00:31:52.578
- No.
- No.

597
00:31:52.613 --> 00:31:54.382
Zach: Good. Good.
That's something.

598
00:31:54.417 --> 00:31:56.582
Wait here.

599
00:31:58.685 --> 00:32:01.620
Quick question.
and please don't be offended.

600
00:32:01.655 --> 00:32:04.590
how on Earth did you afford
a two million Dogecoin robot?

601
00:32:04.625 --> 00:32:07.230
Zach and I came
to an arrangement. all right?

602
00:32:07.265 --> 00:32:10.332
What kind of arrangement?

603
00:32:10.367 --> 00:32:12.466
- That's none of your business.
- To be honest.

604
00:32:12.501 --> 00:32:14.171
I think I preferred you
with ice skates on.

605
00:32:14.206 --> 00:32:16.338
Yeah. well. I preferred you
when you had glass eyes

606
00:32:16.373 --> 00:32:19.044
and a brain powered by Intel.
so...

607
00:32:20.212 --> 00:32:22.608
Okay. so.
we're not in the clear.

608
00:32:22.643 --> 00:32:23.774
but I managed
to locate them.

609
00:32:23.809 --> 00:32:25.578
- Yes.
- Great.

610
00:32:25.613 --> 00:32:27.613
Yeah. I used
a GPS tracking system
that I put in.

611
00:32:27.648 --> 00:32:30.154
But they're gonna
figure this out soon.
so we gotta move fast.

612
00:32:30.189 --> 00:32:32.156
Great. go find our robots.

613
00:32:32.191 --> 00:32:33.553
get back to helping
our dying parents.

614
00:32:33.588 --> 00:32:35.588
Oh. no.
you can't have them back.

615
00:32:35.623 --> 00:32:37.755
- Both: What?
- You just said that we could.

616
00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.295
No. I said I located them.

617
00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.759
but we find them
and destroy them.

618
00:32:41.794 --> 00:32:43.266
I beg your pardon.

619
00:32:43.301 --> 00:32:45.037
I'm not just gonna
dismantle him on a whim.

620
00:32:45.072 --> 00:32:46.566
Okay. maybe you guys
don't understand.

621
00:32:46.601 --> 00:32:48.436
but they're not going
to be obedient anymore.

622
00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:49.734
They're humanizing.

623
00:32:49.769 --> 00:32:51.604
They're learning
to feel and empathize.

624
00:32:51.639 --> 00:32:54.772
and far more dangerously.
to seek vengeance.

625
00:32:54.807 --> 00:32:56.312
( blows raspberry )

626
00:32:56.347 --> 00:32:57.544
Bullshit.

627
00:32:57.579 --> 00:32:59.513
I know C2 better
than anybody else.

628
00:32:59.548 --> 00:33:01.218
He's not capable
of any of that shit.

629
00:33:01.253 --> 00:33:02.516
I'm going to go.
and I'm going to find--

630
00:33:02.551 --> 00:33:04.056
Oh. shut the fuck up.

631
00:33:04.091 --> 00:33:05.387
He knows what
he's talking about.

632
00:33:05.422 --> 00:33:06.520
I am not going to die in jail

633
00:33:06.555 --> 00:33:08.423
because of your
spoiled rotten ass.

634
00:33:08.458 --> 00:33:12.229
Fine! Fuck! Fuck!

635
00:33:12.264 --> 00:33:14.363
Fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck!

636
00:33:14.398 --> 00:33:16.068
Fuckity-fuckity-fuck!

637
00:33:17.368 --> 00:33:20.402
- Are you done?
- Fuck!

638
00:33:20.437 --> 00:33:23.471
- Where are they?
- Oh. uh. Socorro.

639
00:33:23.506 --> 00:33:25.341
I think it's gonna be
a bit of a handful.

640
00:33:25.376 --> 00:33:27.805
so I'm gonna need
you two to go with me.

641
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.181
- Yeah. of course.
- Wait.

642
00:33:30.216 --> 00:33:33.646
I need to pee. and throw up.
possibly kill myself.

643
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:35.549
- Where's your bathroom?
- Right over there.

644
00:33:38.224 --> 00:33:40.620
- So how you doing? Okay.
- No. no. No.

645
00:33:41.689 --> 00:33:43.194
No.

646
00:33:43.229 --> 00:33:44.723
Hey. it's Charles.

647
00:33:44.758 --> 00:33:46.824
Ashley:
<i>Oh! 'Sup. C-Dog?</i>

648
00:33:46.859 --> 00:33:49.200
<i>How's it going?</i>
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

649
00:33:49.235 --> 00:33:50.498
I'm in a bathroom.

650
00:33:50.533 --> 00:33:53.633
Look. I need your help.
I'm desperate.

651
00:33:53.668 --> 00:33:56.570
<i>Do you need me to bring over</i>
<i>some more ass wipes?</i>

652
00:33:56.605 --> 00:33:59.441
No. It's C2.

653
00:33:59.476 --> 00:34:01.542
Look. I can't really talk now.

654
00:34:01.577 --> 00:34:03.214
I'll text you the details.

655
00:34:03.249 --> 00:34:06.118
but just have Fat Ninja
ready to move.

656
00:34:06.153 --> 00:34:07.614

663
00:34:28.703 --> 00:34:30.571
Mm. no.

664
00:34:30.606 --> 00:34:32.738
Wait. you don't like Moby?

665
00:34:32.773 --> 00:34:34.641
God. I love him. I just--

666
00:34:34.676 --> 00:34:38.348
I find him deeply spiritual.

667
00:34:38.383 --> 00:34:41.582

That's the room up there.

673
00:35:01.373 --> 00:35:03.340
They have enough power
to knock them out

674
00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:04.506
till we get them in the van.

675
00:35:04.541 --> 00:35:06.244
Just stay close by me.

676
00:35:06.279 --> 00:35:07.509
and whatever you do.
you gotta be careful

677
00:35:07.544 --> 00:35:10.182
and only use these
when you--

678
00:35:10.217 --> 00:35:11.711
You're 12. you know that?

679
00:35:11.746 --> 00:35:12.877
Pretty good shot
for a 12-year-old.

680
00:35:12.912 --> 00:35:15.550
- It was five feet away.
- Guys. stop.

681
00:35:15.585 --> 00:35:18.355
- ( squawks )
- See? Not that hard to do.

682
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.522
- Oh. for fuck's sake!
- Both: Shh.

683
00:35:20.557 --> 00:35:22.293
They're just up there.
you idiot.

684
00:35:32.536 --> 00:35:35.636
Holy shit.
They're screwing.

685
00:35:35.671 --> 00:35:37.539
What?

686
00:35:42.909 --> 00:35:45.976
They're gonna see you! Move!

687
00:35:46.011 --> 00:35:48.649
Okay. looks like
they just started up.

688
00:35:48.684 --> 00:35:51.520
That should give us
about a five-hour window.

689
00:35:51.555 --> 00:35:52.983
Let's use that time
to make a plan.

690
00:35:53.018 --> 00:35:56.294
I wanna-- or we do that.

691
00:35:56.329 --> 00:36:00.727
Your disgusting joyride is over.

692
00:36:00.762 --> 00:36:03.730
- Hey. I get to shoot me.
- Sorry. I couldn't resist.

693
00:36:03.765 --> 00:36:06.700
Well. fine.
then I'm shooting you.
That's not fair.

694
00:36:06.735 --> 00:36:07.866
Well. it seemed
perfectly fair to me.

695
00:36:07.901 --> 00:36:09.307
You're just not fast enough.

696
00:36:09.342 --> 00:36:10.935
Bullshit.
I'm an excellent marksman.

697
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.706
- Oh. yeah.
- I can hit a quail
from 200 yards.

698
00:36:12.741 --> 00:36:14.906
Oh. Jesus Christ.
what the fuck does it matter?

699
00:36:14.941 --> 00:36:16.578
Charles.
you help me move them

700
00:36:16.613 --> 00:36:18.415
and you stay here
and pack up their shit. okay?

701
00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.781
- Elaine: Oh. my God.
- What?

702
00:36:21.816 --> 00:36:25.752
The fucking bitch stole
my Louis Vuitton airplane bag.

703
00:36:25.787 --> 00:36:28.260
You are a ridiculous
human being.

704
00:36:28.295 --> 00:36:29.888
- One. two. three.
- ( grunting )

705
00:36:29.923 --> 00:36:33.265
There you go.
Okay. That's good.

706
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.464
Fuck.

707
00:36:41.803 --> 00:36:43.506
( scoffs )

708
00:36:45.312 --> 00:36:47.279
Are you fucking serious?

709
00:36:47.314 --> 00:36:48.577
Zach: Do you like Elaine?

710
00:36:48.612 --> 00:36:50.711
Charles: Zach. shut up.

711
00:36:50.746 --> 00:36:52.581
Zach: Have you guys kissed
or anything?

712
00:36:52.616 --> 00:36:55.045
- I won't pissed. Just tell me.
- Charles: Lift it up higher.

713
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.916
- If you like her-- okay.
- Shut up. I will shoot you
with this stun gun.

714
00:36:57.951 --> 00:37:01.788
- ( clattering )
- Hello?

715
00:37:01.823 --> 00:37:03.724
You're coming with me.
robo slut!

716
00:37:03.759 --> 00:37:06.925
Aah! Wait. wait. wait!
You're hurting me!

717
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.598
Not as much as you robots
hurt the job market!

718
00:37:11.668 --> 00:37:14.900
- Who are you?
- ( screaming )

719
00:37:14.935 --> 00:37:17.936
Ow! Put me down!

720
00:37:17.971 --> 00:37:19.773
( both grunting )

721
00:37:19.808 --> 00:37:21.511
- Put me down!
- What the fuck!

722
00:37:23.581 --> 00:37:24.811
Oh. shit.

723
00:37:30.489 --> 00:37:34.557
- Help! Help! Help!
- Oh. shit.

724
00:37:34.592 --> 00:37:35.921
- Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.
- Hey!

725
00:37:35.956 --> 00:37:37.923
- It's me. it's me. it's me.
- What?

726
00:37:37.958 --> 00:37:40.761
- It's me.
- Ashley: Same to you.
you piece of shit.

727
00:37:40.796 --> 00:37:43.467
This is what deserters get!

728
00:37:43.502 --> 00:37:45.733
Fuck you. Ashley!
It's me. Charles!

729
00:37:45.768 --> 00:37:49.737
That's exactly what
a robot would say! Aw. man.

730
00:37:49.772 --> 00:37:51.937
Hey. buddy!
Quick. fire that thing!

731
00:37:51.972 --> 00:37:54.643
- Yes!
- ( groans. farts )

732
00:37:54.678 --> 00:37:56.106
Not at me.
at the fucking robot.

733
00:37:56.141 --> 00:37:59.384
It's me.
We're not fucking robots!

734
00:37:59.419 --> 00:38:02.717
- He's lying!
- Oh. fuck me!

735
00:38:02.752 --> 00:38:05.555
The fuck are you doing.
you idiot?

736
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.920
The eye poke test.
I guess you passed.

737
00:38:07.955 --> 00:38:10.560
What the fuck
is an eye poke test?

738
00:38:10.595 --> 00:38:13.123
Ashley: That's a little trick
I learned in North Korea

739
00:38:13.158 --> 00:38:16.467
to tell the robots
from the humans
in the theater of war.

740
00:38:16.502 --> 00:38:21.538
You see. robots and humans
are exactly the same externally

741
00:38:21.573 --> 00:38:22.770
except for the eyes.

742
00:38:22.805 --> 00:38:24.376
Oh. that's so very interesting.

743
00:38:24.411 --> 00:38:26.037
Who the fuck is this guy?

744
00:38:28.547 --> 00:38:30.712
He's sort of
a friend of mine.

745
00:38:30.747 --> 00:38:32.912
What?
You're the reason he's here?

746
00:38:32.947 --> 00:38:35.387
He just asked me
to bring over
some ass wipes.

747
00:38:35.422 --> 00:38:36.586
Yeah. the rest of this stuff--

748
00:38:36.621 --> 00:38:39.985
- Just stop talking.
- Yes. sir.

749
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.723
So if you two
are the humanoids.

750
00:38:41.758 --> 00:38:43.725
where the robots
I was sent to kidnap?

751
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.793
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?

752
00:38:45.828 --> 00:38:46.827
What is he talking about?

753
00:38:46.862 --> 00:38:50.160
It's fine.
They're in the van.

754
00:38:50.195 --> 00:38:51.865
( tires screeching )

755
00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.801
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

756
00:38:53.836 --> 00:38:54.835
Fuck!

757
00:38:58.874 --> 00:39:01.743
Oh. that's no good.

758
00:39:01.778 --> 00:39:04.911
Let's just hope
for all our sake

759
00:39:04.946 --> 00:39:06.583
they're heading to Mexico.

760
00:39:09.654 --> 00:39:11.654
Why I did think
you could ever be trusted?

761
00:39:13.053 --> 00:39:15.625
I'm sorry. okay? I--

762
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.089
I just didn't think
we needed to get rid of them.

763
00:39:18.124 --> 00:39:21.466
I mean. let's face it.
life without robots
is gonna be pretty shitty.

764
00:39:21.501 --> 00:39:24.931
Yeah?
Well. maybe you're gonna have
a shitty life no matter what.

765
00:39:24.966 --> 00:39:28.407
because you're just a shitty.
shitty. shitty person.

766
00:39:30.675 --> 00:39:32.642
She's got a point.

767
00:39:32.677 --> 00:39:33.940
You know. like.
maybe it is time for you

768
00:39:33.975 --> 00:39:36.107
to turn your life around.

769
00:39:36.142 --> 00:39:41.079
I did this toad venom ceremony
in Huánuco Pampa last year.

770
00:39:41.114 --> 00:39:43.950
I don't wanna say
it changed my life. but...

771
00:39:45.118 --> 00:39:47.019
...it changed my life.

772
00:39:47.054 --> 00:39:48.493
You're right.

773
00:39:50.497 --> 00:39:52.123
Maybe I don't need a robot.

774
00:40:01.508 --> 00:40:03.101
Come on. Charles.

775
00:40:03.136 --> 00:40:04.740
You've got this.

776
00:40:04.775 --> 00:40:07.138
Good morning. coworker.

777
00:40:08.845 --> 00:40:11.846
Yes. I watched
"The Bachelor." too.

778
00:40:15.148 --> 00:40:17.247
Yes. receptionist Joan.

779
00:40:17.282 --> 00:40:19.557
I'd love to see pictures
of your children.

780
00:40:19.592 --> 00:40:21.086
Ah. ah! Fuck!

781
00:40:21.121 --> 00:40:22.494
( groans )

782
00:40:31.197 --> 00:40:32.537
Joan.

783
00:40:35.872 --> 00:40:36.871
Ted: Charles.

784
00:40:42.846 --> 00:40:44.208
Hey. guys.
How's it going?

785
00:40:45.552 --> 00:40:47.981
Son. you need help.

786
00:40:48.016 --> 00:40:52.821
Is this about me calling
Mr. Schulman "sugar tits?"

787
00:40:52.856 --> 00:40:56.121
That and your behavior
last night.

788
00:40:57.729 --> 00:40:58.728
What are you talking about?

789
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:05.603
C2.

790
00:41:07.167 --> 00:41:09.134
I'd been working late at home

791
00:41:09.169 --> 00:41:11.301
and thought that I left a file

792
00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:12.874
in one of
the other guys' desks.

793
00:41:14.812 --> 00:41:15.844
He owed me that.

794
00:41:17.144 --> 00:41:18.550
So did she.

795
00:41:18.585 --> 00:41:20.211
And him.

796
00:41:20.246 --> 00:41:24.853
( whispering )

797
00:41:24.888 --> 00:41:26.558
The bathroom was out of order.

798
00:41:28.353 --> 00:41:33.961
- ( man groans )
- Um. uh...

799
00:41:33.996 --> 00:41:38.801
I'm very sorry.
I've been taking
a lot of Ambien.

800
00:41:38.836 --> 00:41:40.198
How's that stuff
still legal. right?

801
00:41:40.233 --> 00:41:43.608
Maybe we've been
pushing you too hard.

802
00:41:43.643 --> 00:41:45.874
Take some time off. Reset.

803
00:41:45.909 --> 00:41:47.645
You're only human.

804
00:41:58.218 --> 00:42:01.593
( phone vibrating )

805
00:42:03.157 --> 00:42:04.893
Elaine.

806
00:42:04.928 --> 00:42:06.598
I didn't think that
I'd hear from you again.

807
00:42:07.997 --> 00:42:10.195
Yes. Same here.

808
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:11.702
Trashed my office.

809
00:42:11.737 --> 00:42:14.672
Yeah. I know. I get it.
This is all my fault.

810
00:42:17.072 --> 00:42:19.776
Well. we're gonna have
to figure this out.

811
00:42:21.076 --> 00:42:22.614
Maybe we should meet up.

812
00:42:24.145 --> 00:42:26.948
No more tricks. I promise.

813
00:42:30.052 --> 00:42:31.689
This has been
the worst week of my life.

814
00:42:31.724 --> 00:42:35.726
Paranoia. disguises.
and now I'm expected to bang

815
00:42:35.761 --> 00:42:38.256
the 12 douches
I'm dating just to pay rent.

816
00:42:38.291 --> 00:42:41.193
It's just sex
with complete strangers.

817
00:42:41.228 --> 00:42:42.700
I do it all the time.

818
00:42:42.735 --> 00:42:46.737
- Um. two cappuccinos.
- Thank you.

819
00:42:46.772 --> 00:42:48.365
Could I get a sweetener.
please?

820
00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.170
- Yeah.
- I can't do this without E2.

821
00:42:51.205 --> 00:42:53.370
I mean. I'm gonna
have to get a real job.

822
00:42:53.405 --> 00:42:55.372
Trust me. I tried work.

823
00:42:55.407 --> 00:42:58.716
It is literally the worst idea
in the history of the world.

824
00:42:58.751 --> 00:43:00.146
You know. I've been thinking.

825
00:43:00.181 --> 00:43:03.655
What if E2 and C2
really have fallen in love?

826
00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.085
I mean. who knows
what they're capable of.

827
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.823
Maybe we should go to Mexico.

828
00:43:06.858 --> 00:43:09.089
- 100% no.
- But Mexico has everything--

829
00:43:09.124 --> 00:43:11.025
Forget Mexico. okay?

830
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:15.194
We stay here.
we hunt them down.
and we kill them.

831
00:43:15.229 --> 00:43:16.228
Thank you.

832
00:43:22.005 --> 00:43:23.972
- Kill them?
- Kill them.

833
00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:28.108
I'm gonna use the restroom.

834
00:43:28.143 --> 00:43:30.847
Okay. I don't-- I--

835
00:43:35.986 --> 00:43:38.789
( engine starts )

836
00:43:40.452 --> 00:43:42.023
Hey. hey!

837
00:43:42.058 --> 00:43:44.124
Elaine. what the fuck?

838
00:43:44.159 --> 00:43:47.193
- Hey!
- Hey. stop!

839
00:43:47.228 --> 00:43:49.800
- Elaine!
- Charles!

840
00:43:49.835 --> 00:43:51.967
- Come back!
- Charles. stop!

841
00:43:52.002 --> 00:43:53.430
Hey. Charles!

842
00:43:53.465 --> 00:43:55.674
Come back!

843
00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:00.041
- Argh!
- Fuck!

844
00:44:00.076 --> 00:44:03.077
Wait. Wait. you just...

845
00:44:03.112 --> 00:44:07.213
Oh. no.

846
00:44:07.248 --> 00:44:09.017
What the fuck?

847
00:44:09.052 --> 00:44:10.150
Shit.

848
00:44:11.791 --> 00:44:14.121
- Ahh!
- Sorry. I just--

849
00:44:14.156 --> 00:44:17.190
Ow! God. why'd you do it back?

850
00:44:17.225 --> 00:44:19.225
- I needed to check.
- Jesus.

851
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.964
Oh. fuck.
We've been had.

852
00:44:21.999 --> 00:44:24.736
- Fuck. what do we do?
- I don't know.

853
00:44:24.771 --> 00:44:27.002
- They're definitely pissed.
- Yeah. well. no shit.

854
00:44:27.037 --> 00:44:29.202
I did tell C2 we were
planning to kill him.

855
00:44:29.237 --> 00:44:32.205
You idiot.
Why would you do that?

856
00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.943
( sighs )

857
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.014
Charles:
Wonder why they left my car
and took yours.

858
00:44:39.049 --> 00:44:42.446
Well. it seems in addition
to vengeance. they've
also developed taste.

859
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:47.154
- Get off the road.
- ( groans )

860
00:44:47.189 --> 00:44:50.157
<i>( music playing )</i>

861
00:45:01.434 --> 00:45:03.104
I'd offer to buy us a drink.

862
00:45:03.139 --> 00:45:06.239
but your evil twin
stole my credit cards.

863
00:45:06.274 --> 00:45:08.340
And yours took mine.

864
00:45:10.949 --> 00:45:12.784
Do you think
they've had their fun?

865
00:45:14.249 --> 00:45:16.788
( phone vibrating )

866
00:45:19.859 --> 00:45:21.287
I'd say that's highly likely.

867
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.996
- ( squealing )
- God.

868
00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:29.966
- ( sighs )
- ( text chimes )

869
00:45:37.272 --> 00:45:38.810
E2: Okay. let's do this.

870
00:45:40.539 --> 00:45:42.946
- Oh. my God.
- Oh. shit.

871
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.951
- ( gunfire )
- ( screaming )

872
00:45:47.986 --> 00:45:49.447
Oh. my God.

873
00:45:49.482 --> 00:45:54.386
( gunfire and screaming
continue )

874
00:45:54.421 --> 00:45:56.124
- Shit.
- Charles...

875
00:45:56.159 --> 00:45:58.093
We've been perfectly framed.

876
00:45:58.128 --> 00:46:00.491
So what are we gonna do?
We gotta get out of town.

877
00:46:00.526 --> 00:46:04.297
- Yeah.
- Oh. my God!

878
00:46:04.332 --> 00:46:07.300
- Oh. my God.
- I know a place.

879
00:46:11.878 --> 00:46:14.538

<i>♪ Gonna fly ♪</i>

888
00:46:43.668 --> 00:46:47.175
We can hole up here for a bit.
figure out what to do next.

889
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.045
My stepdad never
uses this place.

890
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.180
Great. somewhere picturesque

891
00:46:52.215 --> 00:46:54.479
to plan our next
mass shooting from?

892
00:46:54.514 --> 00:46:56.481
- Whoa. whoa. Phones off.
- What?

893
00:46:56.516 --> 00:46:59.220
Yes. the cops will definitely
be using them to find us.

894
00:46:59.255 --> 00:47:04.390
<i>♪ Never were you bad.</i>
<i>never were you so ♪</i>

895
00:47:04.425 --> 00:47:06.161

<i>♪ Beautiful as one</i>

897
00:47:10.266 --> 00:47:12.101
Listen. it's gonna
get dark soon

898
00:47:12.136 --> 00:47:13.938
and it's gonna be
fucking freezing.

899
00:47:13.973 --> 00:47:15.533
so we should probably
find wood for the fire

900
00:47:15.568 --> 00:47:18.569
and see if there's
any food in here.

901
00:47:21.574 --> 00:47:23.112
Seriously?

902
00:47:23.147 --> 00:47:25.378
Can you please go out
and find some wood?

903
00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.549
- Thank you.
- ( howling )

904
00:47:31.584 --> 00:47:33.958
- What was that?
- A coyote.

905
00:47:33.993 --> 00:47:36.488
- It sounded like a bear.
- It's a coyote.

906
00:47:36.523 --> 00:47:38.424
Definitely sounded like
a big bear to me.

907
00:47:38.459 --> 00:47:40.393
Oh. really?
Since when do bears howl?

908
00:47:40.428 --> 00:47:42.164
When they're horny?

909
00:47:42.199 --> 00:47:44.430
Would you like me
to go get the wood?

910
00:47:44.465 --> 00:47:47.532
- Yes. please.
- You're such a fucking pussy.

911
00:47:47.567 --> 00:47:49.633
Start that and see if
there's any food in there.

912
00:47:58.677 --> 00:48:01.678
<i>( music playing )</i>

913
00:48:08.489 --> 00:48:09.488
Fucking light.

914
00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:15.428
Yes.

915
00:48:20.534 --> 00:48:21.632
Fuck you. log.

916
00:48:29.378 --> 00:48:31.444
You were supposed
to light the fire.

917
00:48:31.479 --> 00:48:34.150
I tried everything
humanly possible.

918
00:48:34.185 --> 00:48:35.283
but that log is faulty.

919
00:48:35.318 --> 00:48:37.648
It's not flammable.

920
00:48:39.256 --> 00:48:41.355
For fuck's sake.

921
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:43.621
Did you know
that Bradley Cooper
used to be straight?

922
00:48:45.361 --> 00:48:47.460
Hey! I was reading that.

923
00:48:54.205 --> 00:48:57.008
Help me. You crumple it up.

924
00:49:01.542 --> 00:49:03.344
Did you manage
to find any food?

925
00:49:03.379 --> 00:49:06.380
Oh. yes.
Mixed news on that front.

926
00:49:06.415 --> 00:49:09.680
I found some old cans.
but unfortunately

927
00:49:09.715 --> 00:49:14.487
there isn't the little machine
C2 uses to open the cans.

928
00:49:14.522 --> 00:49:18.062
Can opener?
You seriously don't know
the term "can opener"?

929
00:49:18.097 --> 00:49:19.624
Great.

930
00:49:36.709 --> 00:49:40.051
Mmm.

931
00:49:40.086 --> 00:49:43.054
Yeah. I told you this place
would be all right
once we got it sorted.

932
00:49:43.089 --> 00:49:44.418
We make quite the team.

933
00:49:45.784 --> 00:49:47.619
What's for dessert?

934
00:49:47.654 --> 00:49:50.424
We make quite the team?

935
00:49:50.459 --> 00:49:53.460
That's like saying
a murderer and their victim
make quite a team.

936
00:49:53.495 --> 00:49:56.463
A team works together
for everyone's mutual benefit.

937
00:49:56.498 --> 00:49:58.696
The only you've done
since we've been up here

938
00:49:58.731 --> 00:50:01.072
is watch me be
your new robot slave.

939
00:50:01.107 --> 00:50:02.502
I provided the cabin.

940
00:50:02.537 --> 00:50:04.735
The rest is not really
my specialty.

941
00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.672
You didn't provide the cabin.
Daddy did.

942
00:50:07.707 --> 00:50:09.608
Just like everything else
in your life.

943
00:50:09.643 --> 00:50:12.644
You know what?
I'm gonna go to sleep.

944
00:50:12.679 --> 00:50:14.844
Because I can't fucking
believe that I am stuck

945
00:50:14.879 --> 00:50:16.681
on the top
of a mountain with you.

946
00:50:16.716 --> 00:50:20.388
with no money
and no friends and no phone.

947
00:50:20.423 --> 00:50:22.291
and a life of jail
waiting for me at the bottom.

948
00:50:22.326 --> 00:50:24.227
And I hope I have a nightmare.

949
00:50:24.262 --> 00:50:27.395
because it'll be better
than this shitty reality.

950
00:50:38.738 --> 00:50:40.243
I'm very sorry. Elaine.

951
00:50:40.278 --> 00:50:42.542
Didn't mean to be
inconsiderate.

952
00:50:42.577 --> 00:50:44.643
You should sleep
in the comfortable chair
next to the fire

953
00:50:44.678 --> 00:50:47.646
- so you don't die
of hypothermia.
- Fuck off.

954
00:50:47.681 --> 00:50:49.582
Can you at least
let me try and move you
closer to the heat?

955
00:50:49.617 --> 00:50:51.485
- No. I'll kick you.
- Well. I'm going to do it.

956
00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.652
Do not kick me.
I'm going to gently move you
towards the fire.

957
00:50:53.687 --> 00:50:55.126
- I'm gonna kick you.
- No. No.

958
00:50:55.161 --> 00:50:56.853
- Stop!
- Come nearer the fire.

959
00:50:56.888 --> 00:50:58.855
- Charles. stop it!
- Otherwise you'll
freeze to death!

960
00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:00.395
Stop!

961
00:51:04.434 --> 00:51:07.138
- I hate you.
- Elaine. we'll swap places.

962
00:51:07.173 --> 00:51:08.733
Let's just be rational here.

963
00:51:08.768 --> 00:51:12.275
I have just consumed
nearly an entire tin of beans.

964
00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:14.772
I should be sleeping
nowhere near an open flame.

965
00:51:14.807 --> 00:51:17.313

998
00:53:33.385 --> 00:53:36.419
And alcoholics.

999
00:53:36.454 --> 00:53:38.850
We need to get off
this mountain.

1000
00:53:38.885 --> 00:53:40.951
It's only gonna be
a matter of time
till the cops find us here.

1001
00:53:40.986 --> 00:53:42.788
That's true.

1002
00:53:42.823 --> 00:53:44.922
Mexico's our only choice.

1003
00:53:44.957 --> 00:53:46.693
How are we supposed
to get to Mexico

1004
00:53:46.728 --> 00:53:49.696
with every cop in the country
looking for America's

1005
00:53:49.731 --> 00:53:53.667
only Lake Placid Blue
double cab Jeep?

1006
00:53:53.702 --> 00:53:56.934
- Ta-da.
- Wow.

1007
00:53:56.969 --> 00:53:58.969
Got up early
this morning to do it.

1008
00:53:59.004 --> 00:54:01.477
Found some old paint
in the shed.

1009
00:54:01.512 --> 00:54:03.941
Guarantee you
it will get us past the cops.

1010
00:54:03.976 --> 00:54:07.780
It's actually really
well camouflaged.

1011
00:54:07.815 --> 00:54:10.684
- Whoa.
- I ran out of green.

1012
00:54:13.623 --> 00:54:17.086
- It'll do the trick.
- Yeah. Should we get going?

1013
00:54:17.121 --> 00:54:19.462
Why don't we get
some lunch first?

1014
00:54:19.497 --> 00:54:21.024
Sure. I'll try
and see if there's any--

1015
00:54:21.059 --> 00:54:24.093
Uh-uh-uh. This way.

1016
00:54:24.128 --> 00:54:26.095
There's something
I wanna show you
in the woods.

1017
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:29.472
- This looks creepy.
- Don't be silly.
Just come on.

1018
00:54:29.507 --> 00:54:32.475
I'm a little scared.

1019
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:35.676
You're scared?
I'm the one that has
to walk back alone.

1020
00:54:37.515 --> 00:54:39.614
Follow me into the woods.

1021
00:54:41.013 --> 00:54:43.948
- Fuck!
- Whoa. what happened?

1022
00:54:43.983 --> 00:54:45.521
- You were an idiot
is what happened.
- What happened?

1023
00:54:45.556 --> 00:54:47.754
What are you talking about?
I didn't do anything?

1024
00:54:49.692 --> 00:54:52.957
I wanted to show you my first.
and if I'm brutally honest.

1025
00:54:52.992 --> 00:54:55.927
only really successful
real estate development.

1026
00:54:55.962 --> 00:54:56.961
Huh?

1027
00:54:58.668 --> 00:55:00.734
( laughs )
Oh.

1028
00:55:00.769 --> 00:55:02.835
Is that your doll house?

1029
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:04.540
It's a fishing lodge.

1030
00:55:04.575 --> 00:55:07.070
- Oh. it's your playhouse.
- No.

1031
00:55:08.612 --> 00:55:10.678
This is really cute.
but I'm starving.

1032
00:55:10.713 --> 00:55:11.712
Where's lunch?

1033
00:55:14.849 --> 00:55:16.816
- Charles: In there.
- What?

1034
00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:19.720
We're going fishing?

1035
00:55:19.755 --> 00:55:21.953
- Yeah.
- Ooh! So exciting.

1036
00:55:21.988 --> 00:55:24.857
( moans )

1037
00:55:24.892 --> 00:55:27.057
How much longer
is this gonna take?

1038
00:55:27.092 --> 00:55:29.125
Three. four hours.

1039
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:33.569
- Four more hours?
- Yes. Do you want a go?

1040
00:55:33.604 --> 00:55:35.571
Don't be disheartened
if you don't get anything.

1041
00:55:35.606 --> 00:55:38.101
Your best weapon is patience.

1042
00:55:38.136 --> 00:55:40.708
Oh. really?
I beg to differ.

1043
00:55:40.743 --> 00:55:42.710
What are you--
hey. be careful!

1044
00:55:42.745 --> 00:55:45.581
- Jesus!
- Get out of the way.

1045
00:55:45.616 --> 00:55:48.419
- Get out of the way.
- Fuck off.

1046
00:55:50.984 --> 00:55:53.182
- That's cheating.
- Not my fault you brought

1047
00:55:53.217 --> 00:55:55.052
a fishing rod to a gun fight.

1048
00:55:55.087 --> 00:55:57.989
Come on. I'll help you.

1049
00:55:58.024 --> 00:55:59.892
- Ah!
- You--

1050
00:55:59.927 --> 00:56:01.630
- I will throw you
in this river.
- No. let go of me!

1051
00:56:01.665 --> 00:56:05.062
I will throw you
in this river.

1052
00:56:05.097 --> 00:56:08.065
You will be swimming
with the trout!

1053
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:11.134
That was actually
very delicious.

1054
00:56:14.645 --> 00:56:16.106
Time to face the music?

1055
00:56:44.136 --> 00:56:49.777
( siren blaring )

1056
00:56:49.812 --> 00:56:52.109
Shit. Shit.

1057
00:56:57.215 --> 00:56:58.852
- We're going to jail.
- No. no.

1058
00:56:58.887 --> 00:57:00.788
- We're going to jail. Elaine.
- Hey. Charles.

1059
00:57:00.823 --> 00:57:02.955
- I can't go to jail.
Not with this face.
- Look at me.

1060
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:04.825
- Charles. don't say anything.
- They'll pass me around
like a joint.

1061
00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.827
- Don't say anything. okay?
- Okay.

1062
00:57:06.862 --> 00:57:08.829
- Let me do the talking. Okay.
- Okay.

1063
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.130
- You know why I stopped you?
- Mass murder.

1064
00:57:13.165 --> 00:57:14.505
- Charles.
- Sorry.

1065
00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:17.673
What?

1066
00:57:17.708 --> 00:57:19.268
Whatever asshole kid
vandalized your vehicle

1067
00:57:19.303 --> 00:57:20.841
also painted over
your brake lights.

1068
00:57:22.273 --> 00:57:23.613
IDs. please.

1069
00:57:30.754 --> 00:57:33.051
Charles. the brake lights.

1070
00:57:33.086 --> 00:57:35.053
I'm sorry.

1071
00:57:36.694 --> 00:57:38.089
It's okay.

1072
00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.666
Officer. I did it.

1073
00:57:43.701 --> 00:57:46.196
I coerced Elaine.
She's completely innocent.

1074
00:57:48.574 --> 00:57:51.003
You painted over
your own lights?

1075
00:57:52.171 --> 00:57:53.808
Why would you do that?

1076
00:57:55.878 --> 00:57:57.812
Just scrape 'em clean
and you can get on your way.

1077
00:57:57.847 --> 00:57:59.583
- Thank you.
- Thanks. officer.

1078
00:57:59.618 --> 00:58:02.278
- We really appreciate it.
- On your way.

1079
00:58:04.183 --> 00:58:05.754
What the fuck?

1080
00:58:05.789 --> 00:58:08.086
He ran the IDs and nothing.

1081
00:58:08.121 --> 00:58:10.594
Turn on your phone.

1082
00:58:10.629 --> 00:58:12.596
- Google "August mass shooting."
- It's America.

1083
00:58:12.631 --> 00:58:14.323
We might need to be
a little bit more specific.

1084
00:58:14.358 --> 00:58:17.865
Yeah. um.
Albuquerque IRS shooting?

1085
00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:21.264
- Nothing.
- Pull up the video again.

1086
00:58:24.368 --> 00:58:27.204
- E2: Okay. let's do this.
- Wait. wait. wait.

1087
00:58:27.239 --> 00:58:29.041
Oh. my God.
there's no cars
in the parking lot.

1088
00:58:29.076 --> 00:58:31.582
And it was a Saturday.

1089
00:58:31.617 --> 00:58:34.244
which means no one
would be in the office.

1090
00:58:34.279 --> 00:58:37.214
- ( gunfire. screaming )
- And those are AR-15s.
AR-15s are semiautomatic.

1091
00:58:37.249 --> 00:58:39.755
That's fully automatic gunfire.
They faked the whole thing.

1092
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:43.858
- What a pair of fucking cunts!
- Yeah.

1093
00:58:43.893 --> 00:58:47.224
They've been
living it up in Mexico
whilst you've been here

1094
00:58:47.259 --> 00:58:49.160
freaking out about
going to prison for no reason.

1095
00:58:50.229 --> 00:58:52.064
Okay. both of us have been.

1096
00:58:53.397 --> 00:58:55.771
Unbelievable.

1097
00:58:55.806 --> 00:58:58.301
Charles.
they're not in Mexico.

1098
00:58:58.336 --> 00:59:00.611
Then where have
they run away to?

1099
00:59:00.646 --> 00:59:02.877
They haven't.

1100
00:59:04.716 --> 00:59:07.244
Both: Oh.

1101
00:59:07.279 --> 00:59:09.818
Oh!

1102
00:59:09.853 --> 00:59:11.721
- Elaine: Ugh.
- Fucking hell.

1103
00:59:11.756 --> 00:59:13.052
This is terrible.

1104
00:59:13.087 --> 00:59:14.889
They've completely
stolen our lives.

1105
00:59:14.924 --> 00:59:17.287
Do we have enough gas
to get to the border?

1106
00:59:17.322 --> 00:59:20.125
No. but we do have enough

1107
00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.128
to get to my stepdad's
house in Santa Fe

1108
00:59:23.163 --> 00:59:25.295
and work out how
we're gonna get our lives back.

1109
00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:28.001
You're right.
Fuck those cunts.

1110
00:59:28.036 --> 00:59:31.070
God. I find it so attractive
when you say that word.

1111
00:59:31.105 --> 00:59:34.337
- Do you?
- Yeah. I think it might be
an English thing.

1126
01:00:52.186 --> 01:00:53.955
telling people
how happy they are.

1127
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:55.990
Charles:
How they complete each other.

1128
01:00:56.025 --> 01:00:59.862
It's so fucked up.

1129
01:00:59.897 --> 01:01:01.358
It's so fucked up.

1130
01:01:03.802 --> 01:01:06.462
( airplane engine )

1131
01:01:08.532 --> 01:01:11.302
- God.
- That's cringe.

1132
01:01:11.337 --> 01:01:13.909
Elaine: Ugh. so cheesy.

1133
01:01:21.886 --> 01:01:24.315
What's going on down there?
Give me those.

1134
01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:25.921
- ( grunts )
- Sorry.

1135
01:01:25.956 --> 01:01:28.517
Ooh. they have arrived.

1136
01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:30.288
- ( gasps ) Oh. my God.
- What?

1137
01:01:30.323 --> 01:01:32.488
Elaine: The fucking bitch stole
my Chanel hula hoop purse.

1138
01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:35.491
- Really?
- Oh. how lame is that?

1139
01:01:35.526 --> 01:01:36.965
They hired a mime.

1140
01:01:39.068 --> 01:01:41.497
- Ow.
- That's not a mime.

1141
01:01:41.532 --> 01:01:44.335
- It's a bloody priest.
- What?

1142
01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:48.339
- We're getting married.
- No.

1143
01:01:48.374 --> 01:01:50.176
- What do we do?
- I got it.

1144
01:01:52.477 --> 01:01:54.851
- I got it. Let's go.
- Go where?

1145
01:01:54.886 --> 01:01:56.017
To stop our wedding.

1146
01:02:00.584 --> 01:02:02.925
I feel kind of bad
for peeling off their faces

1147
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.190
and throwing them in there.

1148
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.392
Walk like you've got
a stick up your ass.

1149
01:02:08.427 --> 01:02:10.394
- Better?
- Too much.

1150
01:02:10.429 --> 01:02:13.133
- Smaller stick.
- More salt!

1151
01:02:15.302 --> 01:02:17.940
- Less soap!
- Yes. Chef.

1152
01:02:20.505 --> 01:02:22.846
Dude. my half-brother
is such a freak.

1153
01:02:22.881 --> 01:02:24.980
He's incapable
of keeping a woman.

1154
01:02:25.015 --> 01:02:27.279
I know because I'm banging
his ex-girlfriend.

1155
01:02:27.314 --> 01:02:30.414
- Mm.
- Hey. welcome to the wedding.

1156
01:02:30.449 --> 01:02:34.418
- What is your problem?
- Uh. my dick's so big
it gives me back pain.

1157
01:02:34.453 --> 01:02:38.356
- Want me to cut it off?
- Okay. yeah. I like her.

1158
01:02:38.391 --> 01:02:42.228
- Prick.
- Charlie. congrats.

1159
01:02:42.263 --> 01:02:44.197
I'm so happy for you.

1160
01:02:44.232 --> 01:02:47.035
- What is it?
- Francesca. my ex.

1161
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:48.938
You know. just because
you're getting married

1162
01:02:48.973 --> 01:02:52.106
it doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

1163
01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:53.470
Maybe you can
take me shopping.

1164
01:02:53.505 --> 01:02:55.571
There will be
benefits for you.

1165
01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:57.474
Fucking gold digger.

1166
01:02:57.509 --> 01:02:58.541
( clears throat )

1167
01:03:01.887 --> 01:03:03.513
Will you excuse me.
Francesca?

1168
01:03:09.125 --> 01:03:11.521
Ted: Speech is in
the courtyard. folks.

1169
01:03:13.932 --> 01:03:16.361
C2: Thank you. everyone.
for making it here
on such short notice.

1170
01:03:16.396 --> 01:03:18.396
Till a couple of days ago.

1171
01:03:18.431 --> 01:03:20.101
most of you probably
didn't even realize

1172
01:03:20.136 --> 01:03:21.432
that Elaine and I were dating.

1173
01:03:21.467 --> 01:03:24.633
But the truth is.
we have more in common

1174
01:03:24.668 --> 01:03:27.009
than you could ever imagine.

1175
01:03:27.044 --> 01:03:30.111
It's almost
as if we're hardwired
to be a couple.

1176
01:03:30.146 --> 01:03:31.640
I see what they did there.

1177
01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:34.313
When we first met.
it was electric.

1178
01:03:34.348 --> 01:03:35.644
"Sparks flew."
Missed that one.

1179
01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:38.086
- Oh. God.
- C2: We're so compatible.

1180
01:03:38.121 --> 01:03:41.155
and that's why we wanted
to get married immediately

1181
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:42.992
just to make things official.

1182
01:03:43.027 --> 01:03:44.994
Oh. no. no. no. Not yet.

1183
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:47.964
We're not married.
That's tomorrow.

1184
01:03:47.999 --> 01:03:49.625
And you know what else
is tomorrow?

1185
01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.034
Dancing. Hit it DJ.

1186
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:53.937
Oh. please. God. no.

1187
01:03:53.972 --> 01:03:57.875
<i>( big band music playing )</i>

1188
01:04:13.552 --> 01:04:15.255
- Stop.
- What?

1189
01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:17.191
<i>( music continues )</i>

1190
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.268
Did we just watch
the same thing?

1191
01:04:28.303 --> 01:04:31.238
We're going to get changed.
We'll be back in a jiffy.

1192
01:04:31.273 --> 01:04:34.208
And please remember.
don't go easy
on the champagne.

1193
01:04:34.243 --> 01:04:36.474
I think I preferred him
without a sense of humor.

1194
01:04:38.577 --> 01:04:40.379
Okay. this is our chance.

1195
01:04:44.088 --> 01:04:45.516
- C2: Come in.
- Room service.

1196
01:04:45.551 --> 01:04:48.255
- E2: Come in.
- Charles?

1197
01:04:48.290 --> 01:04:49.520
Elaine?

1198
01:05:08.475 --> 01:05:11.949
Hey. you go ahead.
I'll catch up.

( grunting )

1201
01:05:22.456 --> 01:05:25.556
- Just leave the bag.
- No fucking way.

1202
01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.431
The guns are running low.
We're gonna have to get rid
of our passengers soon.

1203
01:05:32.466 --> 01:05:34.433
Any bright ideas?

1204
01:05:40.111 --> 01:05:42.672
( grunting )

1205
01:05:46.447 --> 01:05:48.348
Gentlemen first. I guess.

1206
01:05:50.418 --> 01:05:53.650
Both: One. two. three.

1207
01:05:57.062 --> 01:05:58.556
( splashing )

1208
01:06:00.395 --> 01:06:03.396
Should we get Bonnie
now that Clyde is. uh...

1209

( clicks tongue )

1210
01:06:04.696 --> 01:06:06.399
Yeah. let's get this over with.

1211
01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.503
Wait. wait. wait.
She's wearing. like.
12K worth of my jewelry.

1212
01:06:11.538 --> 01:06:13.670
- What?
- Yeah. move.

1213
01:06:13.705 --> 01:06:15.705
- Quickly then.
- Okay.

1214
01:06:18.545 --> 01:06:21.216
It can't be. Elaine.

1215
01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:22.712
- What?
- He's awake.

1216
01:06:22.747 --> 01:06:24.747
The fucker's swimming to shore!

1217
01:06:24.782 --> 01:06:26.716
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

1218
01:06:26.751 --> 01:06:29.092
- I don't--
- Oh. my God. Oh. my God.

1219
01:06:29.127 --> 01:06:32.293
- Come on. come on!
- I told you they
were running low.

1220
01:06:32.328 --> 01:06:35.626
- Shoot her again!
- ( sparking )

1221
01:06:35.661 --> 01:06:37.529
( panting )

1222
01:06:37.564 --> 01:06:41.071
- Okay. At least we got her.
- Okay. Yeah.

1223
01:06:41.106 --> 01:06:42.501
Leaving us the small issue
of getting C2 back.

1224
01:06:42.536 --> 01:06:44.569
All right.
let's get her over the edge.

1225
01:06:44.604 --> 01:06:48.177
Wait. We have got
the one thing in the world
that C2 cares about.

1226
01:06:48.212 --> 01:06:50.278
We need to set a trap.
make him jealous.

1227
01:06:50.313 --> 01:06:54.513
If C2 thinks that E2 is.
you know. into me.

1228
01:06:54.548 --> 01:06:55.844
then he'll come straight to us.

1229
01:06:55.879 --> 01:06:58.121
It'll never work.
She's deprogrammed now.

1230
01:06:58.156 --> 01:07:00.585
She's fucking feral.
She won't do it.

1231
01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:04.259
- If only we had an obedient E2.
- I have an idea.

1232
01:07:04.294 --> 01:07:05.689
Yeah. help me get her
to the Jeep. Come on.

1233
01:07:07.396 --> 01:07:09.264
Aw. shit!

1234
01:07:09.299 --> 01:07:12.300
- ( both grunting )
- We need E3.

1235
01:07:12.335 --> 01:07:13.796
- E3?
- Go get her.

1236
01:07:13.831 --> 01:07:15.303
What are you even talking--
E3? I've never heard that.

1237
01:07:15.338 --> 01:07:18.174
- Zach.
- Uh. who is E3?

1238
01:07:18.209 --> 01:07:19.769
Zach and I used
to work together.

1239
01:07:19.804 --> 01:07:23.278
and I think it's fair to say
that he was attracted to me.

1240
01:07:23.313 --> 01:07:24.378
Obsessed even.

1241
01:07:24.413 --> 01:07:26.611
No. it was. like.
barely a crush.

1242
01:07:26.646 --> 01:07:29.251
- Puppy love.
- Which led to him
breaking into my home

1243
01:07:29.286 --> 01:07:31.154
and installing a camera
in my bathroom.

1244
01:07:31.189 --> 01:07:33.222
You dirty bastard.

1245
01:07:33.257 --> 01:07:35.125
All I did was watch her
brush her teeth.

1246
01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.720
- Mm.
- So I gave him a choice.

1247
01:07:36.755 --> 01:07:38.128
I could call the cops

1248
01:07:38.163 --> 01:07:40.262
or he could build me
a robot double.

1249
01:07:40.297 --> 01:07:41.725
We. uh. negotiated.

1250
01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:46.433
and I also agreed
to letting him build a triple.

1251
01:07:46.468 --> 01:07:50.305
E3. for his personal use.

1252
01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:53.902
I mean. don't get me wrong--
creepy as fuck. But great.

1253
01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:56.146
We have an obedient E2.
Where is she?

1254
01:07:56.181 --> 01:07:59.281
- Well. she's broke.
- Oh. bullshit.
Go and get her.

1255
01:07:59.316 --> 01:08:01.712
- What?
- We need her to make out
with Charles

1256
01:08:01.747 --> 01:08:04.517
while FaceTiming C2 because
he'll think that she's E2.

1257
01:08:04.552 --> 01:08:06.486
he'll get jealous.
and that's how
we lure him back here.

1258
01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:08.851
- He wouldn't fall for that.
- Just let us try it!

1259
01:08:08.886 --> 01:08:11.491
- No!
- Zach. don't you forget

1260
01:08:11.526 --> 01:08:13.295
that you are as much
in the shit as we are.

1261
01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:16.529
So unless you have
a different genius idea...

1262
01:08:19.204 --> 01:08:21.336
Charles: Chop. chop.

1263
01:08:21.371 --> 01:08:22.502
It's. like. crazy.

1264
01:08:22.537 --> 01:08:25.208
'cause I'm older
and they're younger.

1265
01:08:25.243 --> 01:08:27.540
and they're bossing me around?

1266
01:08:28.675 --> 01:08:31.610
- Holy shit.
- Oh. dear.

1267
01:08:31.645 --> 01:08:36.681
It might be kind of fun
to introduce you
to some new friends.

1268
01:08:36.716 --> 01:08:39.684
You are never allowed
to tell anyone about this.

1269
01:08:39.719 --> 01:08:43.259
You're gonna love this.
I'm gonna love it.

1270
01:08:43.294 --> 01:08:45.525
Hi. I'm Elaine.

1271
01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.527
What? No. no. no.
I am Elaine.

1272
01:08:47.562 --> 01:08:49.496
You gotta straighten
that shit out immediately.

1273
01:08:49.531 --> 01:08:52.631
Okay. Honey. I'm gonna have
to change your name. okay?

1274
01:08:52.666 --> 01:08:55.832
So I'm gonna call you E3.

1275
01:08:55.867 --> 01:08:57.702
E2. She needs to be called E2.

1276
01:08:57.737 --> 01:09:00.870
Oh. right. 'cause your
stupid fucking plan. Okay.

1277
01:09:00.905 --> 01:09:03.444
Your name is E2.
Who gives a shit?

1278
01:09:04.645 --> 01:09:07.316
Hi. I'm E2 Who Gives a Shit.

1279
01:09:07.351 --> 01:09:10.220
I see you've taken her brain
and put it in her bra.

1280
01:09:10.255 --> 01:09:12.717
She looks kind of dopey.
Is she all right?

1281
01:09:12.752 --> 01:09:15.852
- Zach: She's perfect.
- You've been a really
dirty boy today.

1282
01:09:15.887 --> 01:09:18.822
I think I should probably clean
your dirty bits and pieces.

1283
01:09:18.857 --> 01:09:20.857
- Oh! No.
- Oh. God. I'm gonna puke.

1284
01:09:20.892 --> 01:09:22.298
No. come on up.
Come on up.

1285
01:09:22.333 --> 01:09:24.465
We don't wanna that.
Elaine-- I mean. E2.

1286
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.237
We got guests.
and we wanna be good hosts.

1287
01:09:27.272 --> 01:09:29.404
That's us time.
That's when it's two. not four.

1288
01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:31.571
E2. from now on.
Charles here.

1289
01:09:31.606 --> 01:09:32.869
this is the guy
that you want. okay?

1290
01:09:32.904 --> 01:09:34.244
Not Zach.

1292

Okay.

1294
01:09:44.883 --> 01:09:48.918
Hi. Charles. Do you want
a little spanky-wanky?

1295
01:09:48.953 --> 01:09:51.393
Okay. yeah.
I'm good for spanky-wanks.

1296
01:09:51.428 --> 01:09:52.526
- You got 20 minutes.
- Jesus.

1297
01:09:52.561 --> 01:09:54.330
And the safe word is "Kanye."

1298
01:09:54.365 --> 01:09:55.826
Charles:
Right. Just slow down.

1299
01:09:55.861 --> 01:09:57.894
We want you to make a video.

1300
01:09:57.929 --> 01:10:01.403
Oh. I've made
so many videos before.

1301

She's with me right now.

You can come and get me.

That's Elaine.
I want to see E2.

1309
01:10:24.593 --> 01:10:28.397
Damn. you're smart.
I'll have you know
that E2's here as well.

- Mm-hmm.

Spanky-wanky time.

Oh. another Charles.
just like my baby boy.

1313

- What have you done to her?
- We're at Zach's.

1314

a little bit.

made her a little more fun.

No. That's not possible.

1317

a lot more friendly.

01:12:47.098 --> 01:12:50.132
Ugh. maybe I should
just let this happen.

1359
01:12:50.167 --> 01:12:52.475
No! No!

1360
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:54.103
( all grunting )

1361
01:12:54.138 --> 01:12:55.775
- Stop. No.
- Come here!

1362
01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:58.140
Get off me! Zach!

1363
01:12:58.175 --> 01:13:01.649
- ( grunting )
- Okay!

1364
01:13:03.081 --> 01:13:04.949
20 minutes is up!

1365
01:13:07.151 --> 01:13:10.427
- Zach.
- Kanye.

1366
01:13:12.497 --> 01:13:14.629
Why didn't you say
the safe word?

1367
01:13:14.664 --> 01:13:17.665
- We fucking did.
- Like 20.000 times.

1368
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.030
- You're supposed
to say it in my voice.
- What?

1369
01:13:20.065 --> 01:13:22.802
Zach: You know.
if you monsters will excuse us.

1370
01:13:22.837 --> 01:13:24.837
I have to give Elaine
a nice bubble bath.

1371
01:13:24.872 --> 01:13:28.071
- Oh. God.
- I'm so sorry.

1372
01:13:28.106 --> 01:13:29.237
Oh. Charles.
could you get dressed?

1373
01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:30.975
I lost a sock.

1374
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:32.779
And one of my testicles.

1375
01:13:32.814 --> 01:13:35.782
- ( laughs )
- It's not funny.

1376
01:13:35.817 --> 01:13:38.015
- It's kind of funny.
- No. it is not.

1377
01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:40.622
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes. as long as I never

1378
01:13:40.657 --> 01:13:43.625
have to see
a robot double of you again.

1379
01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.055
( Elaine gasps )
Fuck.

1380
01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:46.892
- ( muffled grunting )
- No.

1381
01:13:46.927 --> 01:13:49.895
- ( wheels screeching )
- ( clattering )

1382
01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:52.634
( E2 mumbling. grunting )

1383
01:13:54.264 --> 01:13:56.198
- Elaine: It's him.
- Charles: Zach's gun.

1384
01:14:01.711 --> 01:14:03.139
I'm sorry. C2.

1385
01:14:03.174 --> 01:14:04.943
I don't really have a choice.

1386
01:14:07.244 --> 01:14:08.815
Huh?

1387
01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:10.080
It's a fucking paintball gun.

1388
01:14:10.115 --> 01:14:11.719
What?

1389
01:14:17.221 --> 01:14:19.089
- My darling.
- C2!

1390
01:14:19.124 --> 01:14:21.729
Your wedding dress
is everything
I imagined and more.

1391
01:14:21.764 --> 01:14:24.666
- ( siren wailing )
- The cops.

1392
01:14:24.701 --> 01:14:26.030
( siren chirps )

1393
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.164
( muttering )

1394
01:14:30.003 --> 01:14:33.840
Belen Police. Oh. shit.

1395
01:14:33.875 --> 01:14:34.973
Are you seeing this. Chavez?

1396
01:14:35.008 --> 01:14:36.139
Boss. I don't know
what this is.

1397
01:14:36.174 --> 01:14:37.877
Sheriff:
On your knees!

1398
01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:42.310
Hands on your heads.

1399
01:14:42.345 --> 01:14:44.081
fingers interlocked.

1400
01:14:46.019 --> 01:14:47.282
Wow.

1401
01:15:03.102 --> 01:15:04.937
This is big.

1402
01:15:04.972 --> 01:15:07.203
Even bigger than
the doorbell camera
butthole flasher.

1403
01:15:07.238 --> 01:15:09.139
I'm for sure
gonna be on multiple
true crime podcasts.

1404
01:15:09.174 --> 01:15:11.009
But. boss--

1405
01:15:11.044 --> 01:15:13.110
Boss. it was me
who discovered the--

1406
01:15:13.145 --> 01:15:16.113
( cell door opens )

1407
01:15:20.086 --> 01:15:24.726
So. what
I'm struggling to understand
is how identical twins

1408
01:15:24.761 --> 01:15:28.730
came to have
identical fingerprints.

1409
01:15:28.765 --> 01:15:32.195
Far as I can see.
there's only one explanation.

1410
01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:36.133
Two of y'all are robot
"fac-sea-miles."

1411
01:15:36.168 --> 01:15:37.640
It's actually
pronounced "facsim--"

1412
01:15:39.105 --> 01:15:41.039
Uh. sorry.
you were saying?

1413
01:15:41.074 --> 01:15:43.877
Whichever of you are humans.
enjoy this cell.

1414
01:15:43.912 --> 01:15:48.376
It's the nicest one
you're gonna see
for the next 40 years.

1415
01:15:48.411 --> 01:15:52.721
And for you robots in here.
say your good-byes.

1416
01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:54.184
The only way you'll
see each other again

1417
01:15:54.219 --> 01:15:57.286
is if you're recycled in
the same Bud Light six-pack.

1418
01:15:57.321 --> 01:15:59.024
I'll be back in the morning

1419
01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:01.664
with some Federal Robot
Enforcement agents.

1420
01:16:03.294 --> 01:16:04.964
( cell door slams )

1421
01:16:04.999 --> 01:16:08.264
I'm heading home to polish
my badge and boots. Chavez.

1422
01:16:08.299 --> 01:16:11.267
This time tomorrow.
I'll be on Fox News.

1423
01:16:11.302 --> 01:16:12.675
A hero.

1424
01:16:19.783 --> 01:16:22.817
I can't believe we're
actually eating jail food.

1425
01:16:24.381 --> 01:16:25.820
Don't worry.

1426
01:16:25.855 --> 01:16:27.349
You're not missing out
on much.

1427
01:16:29.188 --> 01:16:31.287
We're robots.

1428
01:16:31.322 --> 01:16:33.696
There are many things
we don't need.

1429
01:16:33.731 --> 01:16:39.328
Food. sleep. oxygen.

1430
01:16:39.363 --> 01:16:42.100
We're glorified appliances

1431
01:16:42.135 --> 01:16:44.674
built to live
our lives as slaves.

1432
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:46.302
E2: Alone.

1433
01:16:48.471 --> 01:16:50.680
At least.
that's what we thought...

1434
01:16:52.013 --> 01:16:55.377
...until we met. fell in love.

1435
01:16:57.755 --> 01:17:01.251
Something we didn't
even think was possible.

1436
01:17:01.286 --> 01:17:04.826
You told us
thousands of times
love isn't real.

1437
01:17:04.861 --> 01:17:10.359
It's a delusional state
that only ends in misery.

1438
01:17:10.394 --> 01:17:12.361
E2: But we realized
you're wrong.

1439
01:17:12.396 --> 01:17:16.937
Love is real.
and it's the cure to misery.

1440
01:17:18.369 --> 01:17:22.041
You're humans.
That's what you do.

1441
01:17:22.076 --> 01:17:24.439
You sabotage your own happiness.

1442
01:17:26.179 --> 01:17:29.719
We would rather die
as robots with love

1443
01:17:29.754 --> 01:17:31.886
than live
our lives like you.

1444
01:17:31.921 --> 01:17:33.316
humans without it.

1445
01:17:45.528 --> 01:17:47.396
Jesus.

1446
01:17:48.773 --> 01:17:50.872
We've been such
fucking idiots.

1447
01:17:52.106 --> 01:17:53.908
Yeah.

1448
01:17:55.373 --> 01:17:57.978
None of it matters
anymore though.

1449
01:17:59.278 --> 01:18:00.442
It's all over.

1450
01:18:07.825 --> 01:18:09.418
What are you doing?

1451
01:18:09.453 --> 01:18:11.156
I'd like my phone call. please!

1452
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:14.291
I want to speak to my lawyer.

1453
01:18:16.295 --> 01:18:18.163
- One quick call.
- Thank you.

1454
01:18:18.198 --> 01:18:19.428
- I'll be listening.
- Good.

1455
01:18:19.463 --> 01:18:20.462
Mm-hmm.

1456
01:18:23.401 --> 01:18:24.939
Hello?

1457
01:18:24.974 --> 01:18:27.106
It's Charles Cameron.

1458
01:18:27.141 --> 01:18:29.108
I've been arrested.

1459
01:18:29.143 --> 01:18:32.540
I'm at Belen Sheriff's Office.

1460
01:18:32.575 --> 01:18:35.048
Just do whatever you can.

1461
01:18:36.546 --> 01:18:40.790
Thank you very much. Mr. Ninja.

1462
01:18:43.355 --> 01:18:47.962
Mr. F. Ninja.

1463
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:51.064
Oh. for fuck's sake.

1464
01:18:52.133 --> 01:18:59.039
Mr. F-A-T Ninja. Yes.

1465
01:19:01.175 --> 01:19:03.978
- Okay. thank you.
- Come on. Let's go.

1466
01:19:04.013 --> 01:19:07.113
My lawyer's a bit old.
He gets quite confused.

1467
01:19:11.053 --> 01:19:13.152
Our lives are in
the hands of a man

1468
01:19:13.187 --> 01:19:16.188
that I am pretty sure
is illiterate.

1469
01:19:20.997 --> 01:19:23.261
( phone ringing )

1470
01:19:23.296 --> 01:19:25.593
Belen Sherriff's Office.
Deputy Chavez.

1471
01:19:25.628 --> 01:19:27.496
Ashley:
<i>I need to file a report.</i>

1478
01:19:43.019 --> 01:19:44.854
<i>Pretty certain</i>

1479
01:19:44.889 --> 01:19:48.319
Okay. thank you

1480

<i>Lieutenant Alex Mason.</i>
<i>Seal Team 7.</i>

Well. thank you

Lieutenant Mason.

Listen. I'm on my way. okay?

confront the suspects.

Fuck him.
You got this. Chavez.

1486
01:20:31.661 --> 01:20:33.496
Charles: Yes! Ashley!

1487
01:20:35.335 --> 01:20:37.137
Go. go. go.

1488
01:20:38.371 --> 01:20:41.372
Keys.

1489
01:20:41.407 --> 01:20:43.440
Hey. Charles.
can I get a word?

1490
01:20:43.475 --> 01:20:45.013
I'm C2.

1491
01:20:47.545 --> 01:20:50.447
Hey. Charles.
you know you don't
have to go to Mexico.

1492
01:20:50.482 --> 01:20:52.449
I could always just
kill those robots for you.

1493
01:20:52.484 --> 01:20:54.649
Yeah. thanks. Ashley.

1494
01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:57.157
but I think we're gonna cross
the border together. my friend.

1495
01:20:57.192 --> 01:20:59.324
- We really should go.
- Ashley: I get it. sir.

1496
01:20:59.359 --> 01:21:02.624
- Good-bye. Elaine.
- E2: Oh. I'm E2.

1497
01:21:02.659 --> 01:21:03.966
God damn it.

1498
01:21:04.001 --> 01:21:05.495
Elaine.
I won't forget you.

1499
01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:07.497
- And good luck in Mexico.
- Charles: Thanks. Ashley.

1500
01:21:07.532 --> 01:21:09.631
- I'll get rid of the evidence.
- Good work. soldier.

1501
01:21:09.666 --> 01:21:11.567
Thank you. sir.

<i>( music playing )</i>

1503
01:21:30.093 --> 01:21:32.225
Not far till freedom.

1504
01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.359
How are you planning
to use it?

1505
01:21:34.394 --> 01:21:36.658
Well. first of all.
we'd like to get married.

1506
01:21:36.693 --> 01:21:39.463
Hopefully without
interruptions this time.

1507
01:21:39.498 --> 01:21:42.070
Then I'd like to learn
to scuba dive.

1508
01:21:42.105 --> 01:21:44.534
In case someone tries
to throw you in a lake again?

1509
01:21:44.569 --> 01:21:46.668
We can learn together.

1510
01:21:46.703 --> 01:21:49.242
Get a little house
on the beach.

1511
01:21:51.279 --> 01:21:53.675
- Mm.
- What about you two?

1512
01:21:53.710 --> 01:21:55.314
Oh. I don't know.

1513
01:21:55.349 --> 01:21:59.120
Probably check myself
into rehab for purse addiction.

1514
01:21:59.155 --> 01:22:00.715
Will you see each other?

1515
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:04.158
See each other?
Uh. you mean. like...

1516
01:22:04.193 --> 01:22:06.424
- As friends.
- Oh. right. Yeah.

1517
01:22:06.459 --> 01:22:09.031
- Yeah. I mean. you know--
- Of course. We're friends.

1518
01:22:09.066 --> 01:22:12.166
Charles: Yeah. I mean.
she's gonna want me hanging
around me all the time.

1519
01:22:12.201 --> 01:22:14.432
Yeah. he's not gonna
want me hanging around
all the time either.

1520
01:22:14.467 --> 01:22:18.073
so we'll just see each other
when we see each other.

1521
01:22:18.108 --> 01:22:19.074
Yes.

1522
01:22:19.109 --> 01:22:20.537

Sorry. entry is not granted.

1529
01:23:09.687 --> 01:23:12.754

- Sorry. entry is not granted.

1530
01:23:12.789 --> 01:23:14.195
What? Do it again.

1531
01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:15.493
Is it charged? Is it on?

1532

Try it again. Try this eye.

bribe the bastard.

1541

He won't make an exception.
He's programmed not to.

( siren wailing )

1543
01:23:44.887 --> 01:23:48.592
- Go.
- But you'll be arrested.

1544

The woman you love
and who loves you

1545

You're still my robot.
That's an order.

Good-bye. my friend.

1549
01:24:15.522 --> 01:24:17.852
Thanks for showing me
how to be a human.

Hands in front of you now

01:24:59.962 --> 01:25:01.368
Now!

1561
01:25:12.348 --> 01:25:15.283
- Humans.
- Beats an eye poke test.

1562
01:25:16.385 --> 01:25:18.781
All right. where are they?

1563
01:25:21.753 --> 01:25:23.588
Both of your hands out.
You're under arrest.

1564
01:25:23.623 --> 01:25:26.459
You're going away
for a long time.

1565
01:25:26.494 --> 01:25:28.659
Hang on.
What exactly are they being
arrested for. Sheriff?

1566
01:25:28.694 --> 01:25:31.827
Well. having robot
"fac-sea-miles." obviously.

1567
01:25:31.862 --> 01:25:33.598
And where's your evidence?

1568
01:25:33.633 --> 01:25:36.964
Do you have videos.
prints. mugshots?

1569
01:25:36.999 --> 01:25:40.308
No. no.
They blew up my jail.

1570
01:25:41.806 --> 01:25:43.245
- Agent: Let's go.
- Sheriff: No. no. no. no.

1571
01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:48.514
You are an idiot.
Never call me again.

1572
01:25:48.549 --> 01:25:49.680
We're out of here.

1573
01:25:53.851 --> 01:25:58.260
So. I. uh-- I guess
we're not going to jail

1574
01:25:58.295 --> 01:25:59.492
for the rest of our lives?

1575
01:25:59.527 --> 01:26:01.560
It would seem so.

1576
01:26:03.993 --> 01:26:07.632
So what do you want
to do now?

1577
01:26:09.504 --> 01:26:10.767
This.

1578
01:26:15.312 --> 01:26:18.247
( cheering )

1579
01:26:18.282 --> 01:26:21.580
My darlings. congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.

1580
01:26:21.615 --> 01:26:23.252
- Thanks. Mum.
- But where'd you go?

1581
01:26:23.287 --> 01:26:24.616
We thought you'd got cold feet.

1582
01:26:24.651 --> 01:26:26.882
Oh. no. we just--

1583
01:26:26.917 --> 01:26:28.884
just wanted a little
bit of quiet time together

1584
01:26:28.919 --> 01:26:30.325
before the chaos
of the wedding.

1585
01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.019
Oh. honey. lovely.

1586
01:26:32.054 --> 01:26:34.494
Oh. God.
What happened to Ted Jr.?

1587
01:26:34.529 --> 01:26:36.694
Mother:
Oh. it's his allergy.

1588
01:26:36.729 --> 01:26:40.599
Some asshole put Nutella
in the Wagyu sliders.

1589
01:26:40.634 --> 01:26:42.601
Be right back.

1590
01:26:42.636 --> 01:26:45.868
Oh. poor little Teddy
with his fat little face.

1591
01:26:45.903 --> 01:26:48.541
Oh. do you see
his big little ear?

1592
01:26:50.039 --> 01:26:52.545
( no audible dialogue )

1593
01:26:57.354 --> 01:26:59.882
Schulman. Good evening. sir.

1594
01:26:59.917 --> 01:27:02.720
I gather that you met
my wife Kiki yesterday.

1595
01:27:05.956 --> 01:27:08.627
I did. and she actually
grabbed my ass

1596
01:27:08.662 --> 01:27:09.958
pretty aggressively. sir.

1597
01:27:09.993 --> 01:27:13.830
- You're fired.
- I know.

1598
01:27:13.865 --> 01:27:19.506

You miss your robots yet?

1603
01:27:33.984 --> 01:27:37.084

Been in the bathroom
doing blow with some guy
named David Schulman.

1605
01:27:39.759 --> 01:27:41.726
He offered me a job
as an architect.

1606

- Both: What?
- Whatever the fuck that is.
