Well do it a second time then.

Two times a charm.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.220
- Can't say that I have.

110

I think they're thinking of
piss or something. I don't know.

You're so pretty.

169
00:09:46.473 --> 00:09:48.840
- What you did tonight was really stupid.

170
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.750
- Please. who cares?

171
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.300
- Me. your mom and your sister.

172
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.250
When was the last time you called them?

173
00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.760
Call your mom. Jure.

174
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.723
She's all alone in that castle.

175
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.280
And if you get sick.
please get it in the bowl

176
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.333
not on the carpet.

177
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.543

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.383
Darya!

- No. I'm not sick. no. listen.

184
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.543
I was thinking. how would you like to die?

185
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.170
- I'm already dead. remember?

186
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.167
You're the one who turned me.

187
00:10:46.167 --> 00:10:47.290
- No. not like that.

188
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.900
You know what I mean?

189
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.853
- Oh. you're just stupid. go to sleep.

190
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.863
- The way I picture it.

191
00:11:17.201 --> 00:11:22.034
I'm standing on a hilltop.
then a sliver of the light.

192
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.647
far off at the distance.

193
00:11:32.277 --> 00:11:34.960
And then this sliver of light.

194
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.960
just explodes in million sun rays.

195
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.323
And they break all over the mountains.

196
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.893
Then they reach out to me.

197
00:11:49.755 --> 00:11:51.183
And I feel the warmth.

198
00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.453
Just for a second.

199
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:01.060
I feel the warmth.

200
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:07.140
And then my body bursts into embers

201
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.790
and gets blown away by the wind.

202
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.083
You are just being morbid.

203
00:12:19.083 --> 00:12:21.061
Get some sleep.

204
00:13:21.287 --> 00:13:22.563
Oh. I'm sorry.

205
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.393
Did I wake you up?

206
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.313
- Yep.

207
00:13:29.877 --> 00:13:31.210
How you feeling?

208
00:13:32.167 --> 00:13:33.623
- I feel like shit.

209
00:13:37.064 --> 00:13:40.610
Darya. I'm sorry about
happened last night.

210
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.753
- Yeah.

211
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.940
Well that was just really stupid.

212
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.290
but that's to be expected. I guess.

213
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.190
- To be expected.

214
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.867
Why do you always have
to insult me like this?

215
00:13:50.867 --> 00:13:52.840
- 'Cause I'm tired of your crap.

216
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.950
- Can you do us both
a favor and let me try

217
00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.420
to make this relationship work.

218
00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.970
- You can't give back
what you took from me.

219
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.593
- Yeah. I can't. but you know

220
00:14:00.593 --> 00:14:02.757
that that's the only way I could have you.

221
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.010
- This isn't about you anymore.

222
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.120
Is it?

223
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.413
We already did that.

224
00:14:11.991 --> 00:14:13.713
I just can't do this right now.

225
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.283
Go home. Jure. please and
then just leave me alone.

226
00:15:50.113 --> 00:15:51.960
What can I get for ya?

227
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.780
- Well. I'd really like a girl like you.

228
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.243
But for now. I'll have a whiskey. neat.

229
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:09.903
Thank you.

230
00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.630
- That guy down there. he's cute.

231
00:16:19.823 --> 00:16:21.343
Hm. he's a thirsty boy.

232
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.130
- Here's another one for ya.

233
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.963
- Thank you.

234
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.030
You're such a poser.

235
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.370
Shut up. Mithra.

236
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.860
This is not dark and
angry. like a pagan god.

237
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.320
Oh. I'm sorry. Judas.

238
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.502
I don't latch on to whichever trends

239
00:16:49.502 --> 00:16:52.130
hipsters are writing from day to day.

240
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.930
You know. Zoroaster. was doing this stuff

241
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.665
way before Jesus--

242
00:16:56.665 --> 00:16:58.220
Fuck!

243
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.470
It's not
a trend. it's for real.

244
00:17:03.502 --> 00:17:05.810
Whatever.

245
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:07.755
We are
the light of the world.

246
00:17:07.755 --> 00:17:10.115
Let me see your light shine.

247
00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:14.543
I'm not seeing it. come on.

248
00:17:14.543 --> 00:17:16.793
Let me see your light shine.

249
00:17:18.269 --> 00:17:20.682
Come on. let me see your light shine!

250
00:17:27.503 --> 00:17:29.350
So what do I
do for the next two days

251
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.183

252
00:17:30.183 --> 00:17:32.870
Oh. don't ask
me. I'm not from here. so.

253
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.090
- Yeah. you don't seem like
you're from around here.

254
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.343
- Is it that obvious?

255
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.353
- The accent?

256
00:17:39.353 --> 00:17:41.870
- Well. you know. I'm been all over

257
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.840
and this just seemed like
a great place to get away

258
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.963
and leave some old baggage behind.

259
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.993
- And how's that working out for ya?

260
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.247
- It's working itself out.

261
00:18:00.518 --> 00:18:01.768
What about you?

262
00:18:02.622 --> 00:18:04.447
What brings you here?

263
00:18:04.447 --> 00:18:06.570
- I'm just here for a few
days for the conference.

264
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.330
It's a good break from the daily grind.

265
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.200
Home and Garden--
- Okay.

266
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.420

275
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.040
Or you finally had
enough to ask me out yet?

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.320

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.940
You could just drop us

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.467
What the fuck?

309
00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:17.398

Come on now.

344
00:22:40.665 --> 00:22:41.865
Do you have any tissues?

345
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.227
Open your mouth.

No way.

We've got the same name.

355
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.950
Well. it's similar technically
because my birth name

356
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:28.150
is different. it's Jure.

357
00:23:29.686 --> 00:23:32.603
But you Americans always
pronounced it somehow like jar.

358
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.623
So. you know. I like been Joe.

359
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.193

- Did you ever travel anywhere

365
00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.772
or you just spend your whole
life in this little shit hole?

366
00:24:01.772 --> 00:24:03.235
- I traveled a bit.

367
00:24:03.235 --> 00:24:04.090
I went to the Grand Canyon.

368
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.130
I took the kids to Disneyland last year.

369
00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.220
- So. pretty much stayed
close to home then. huh?

370
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.399
- Yeah.

371
00:24:10.399 --> 00:24:13.370
- You see. I traveled all over the world

372
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.070
and I'll tell you this. I
always lived pretty rural.

373
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.747
but Americans rural.

374
00:24:20.747 --> 00:24:23.550
that's a different breed. if you ask me.

375
00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.963
People here have this.
what should I call it?

376
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.433
Rugged sense of self
satisfaction. you know.

377
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.313
I envy that.

378
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.750
Y'all don't know much.

379
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.213
but you know everything you want to know.

380
00:24:40.509 --> 00:24:42.980
Just going through your days

381
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.640
without thinking too much about it.

382
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.830
I wish I can live like that.

383
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.288
I swear I would.

384
00:24:49.288 --> 00:24:51.040
Going through your days

385
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.017
.

386
00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.035
You can pull over there.
you see that dark spot?

387
00:24:59.035 --> 00:25:01.551
You can just go there.

388
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:02.384
I'm so tired.

389
00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.453
So tired.

390
00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.290
Life gets tiring. if you
think too much about it.

391
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:14.290
You get shit on. you get
betrayed. people disappoint you.

392
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.903
Hell. seems to me. all I
do is I disappoint people.

393
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.870
But in the end. all that it's
for it's for some memories.

394
00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:23.723
Memories.

395
00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.280
Everybody's just a few
little lingering memories

396
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.663
and then they fade away.

397
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.400
Not a traces of them left.

398
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.233
Nothing.

399
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.960
But you are lucky. you know why?

400
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.920
Because death just happens for you.

401
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.290
Poof.

402
00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:45.123
You are dead.

403
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.213
No effort.

404
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.333
Oh man. do you know how
lucky you are for that?

405
00:25:52.213 --> 00:25:53.433
- No.

406
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.300
Please. you don't have to.

407
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.850
I won't tell anyone.

408
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.460
- Well. Joe. I'm sure you believe that

409
00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.130
because you seem like a nice guy.

410
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.017
I can tell you.

411
00:26:05.547 --> 00:26:08.430
But you will and then
we have a big problem

412
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:11.480
because then what's going to happen

413
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.514
is Novigrad all over again.

414
00:26:14.347 --> 00:26:15.262
Listen. listen to me.

415
00:26:15.262 --> 00:26:17.212
Relax Joe. Listen. listen. it's all good.

416
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.360
It would be with police and with guns

417
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.575
and I'm so sorry. I can't
do that tonight. buddy.

418
00:26:22.575 --> 00:26:23.408
No.

419
00:26:24.241 --> 00:26:25.320
No. not tonight.

420
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.710
Darya already hates me.

421
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:27.910
Right?

422
00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:29.670
So I don't need to make that worse.

423
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.260
But. hey. hey. relax.

424
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.377
Think about it this way.
think about it this way.

425
00:26:33.377 --> 00:26:36.017
hey. hey. no more struggles for you.

426
00:26:37.044 --> 00:26:39.713
No more empty time to fill.

427
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.603
You just finished early.

428
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.760
You haven't been drinking. have you?

429
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.350
Yeah. I didn't think so.

430
00:27:59.471 --> 00:28:00.304
- Hey man.

431
00:28:07.567 --> 00:28:11.253
You guys carry any Balkan Vodka?

432
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.223
It's an import.

433
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.970
I don't think so.

434
00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.353
Maybe on that shelf there.

435
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.540
Well. you don't have it. so.

436
00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.910
I told you we didn't have it.

437
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:42.800
- Yeah. I heard you.

438
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.640
So these will have to do.

439
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.140
It's fine.

440
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.710
Oh. I'm sorry. man. listen.
it has just been one

441
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.040
of those nights. you know what I mean?

442
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:10.482
Oh. fuck.

443
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.405
Are you Spencer?

444
00:31:04.405 --> 00:31:05.339
Yeah. that's me.

445
00:31:05.339 --> 00:31:06.740
You Joe?

446
00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.053
Yeah. that's me.

447
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.483
Hop on in. buddy.

448
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.883
God damn. what a night.

449
00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.642
- Have couple too many drinks. buddy. huh?

450
00:31:21.642 --> 00:31:23.763
More than I planned.

451
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.085
Onward. Joe.

452
00:31:27.774 --> 00:31:31.108
That's how I like it. man.

453
00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.113
Are you girls gonna
keep partying. or what?

454
00:31:38.946 --> 00:31:40.659
Oh. my god!

455
00:31:40.659 --> 00:31:42.906
what the stars are about

456
00:31:51.482 --> 00:31:53.232
- Five stars for Joe.

457
00:32:06.433 --> 00:32:07.686
Sir. do you need a ride?

458
00:32:07.686 --> 00:32:09.857
- I don't even remember calling.

459
00:32:09.857 --> 00:32:12.638
Come on. come on in.

460
00:32:12.638 --> 00:32:14.382
Bye. sweetheart.

461
00:32:14.382 --> 00:32:15.715
Bye. sweetheart.

462
00:34:12.158 --> 00:34:13.630
You want anything?

463
00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:14.650
I can order some room service

464
00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:17.263
if you want breakfast or anything.

465
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:21.793
- That's so sweet. but thanks. I'm fine.

466
00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.257
I'll be out in a second.

467
00:34:44.155 --> 00:34:44.988
Shit!

468
00:34:44.988 --> 00:34:45.821
You okay in there?

469
00:34:45.821 --> 00:34:47.060
- Yeah. fine.

470
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.253
Just forgot something.

471
00:34:49.452 --> 00:34:50.619
Okay.

472
00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.653
- Do you mind closing the blinds?

473
00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:04.260
I hate mornings and I like
to ease into the day slowly.

474
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.656
Yeah. sure.

475
00:35:05.656 --> 00:35:06.489
- I know it's weird.

476
00:35:06.489 --> 00:35:07.413
- No problem.

477
00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.320
I had a really good time.

478
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.170
- Well. you know where to find me.

479
00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.463
Stop by if you have another free night.

480
00:35:47.734 --> 00:35:48.783
- Yeah?

481
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.700
Even after...

482
00:35:54.462 --> 00:35:55.437
You know.

483
00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:59.473
- They don't call it
whiskey dick for nothing.

484
00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.520
Drop by and we'll give it another go.

485
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.560
- Yeah.
- Sound good?

486
00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.410
- Yeah. for sure.

487
00:36:42.268 --> 00:36:44.680
- What are you doing?

488
00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.170
You set up the whole bar for me?

489
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:47.770
- Oh. I have some time to kill.

490
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:48.800
Really. it's totally cool.

491
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.291
- That's so sweet.

492
00:36:51.124 --> 00:36:52.680
How is your mom?

493
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.080
- She's getting better. thanks for asking.

494
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:55.913
- Okay. yeah.

495
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:58.990
- I'm glad you didn't go out last night.

496
00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:00.390
- Why. what's up?

497
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:01.900
- There's some maniac out there.

498
00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.623
They're still finding more bodies.

499
00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.010
Seems totally random.

500
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:10.190
- Oh my god. that's just horrible.

501
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.010
- The whole world's going to shit.

502
00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:15.056
I don't know what's wrong
with people nowadays.

503
00:37:15.056 --> 00:37:16.473
Desperate for clues.

504
00:37:16.473 --> 00:37:17.306
If you or anyone else--

505
00:37:17.306 --> 00:37:19.417
- I'll be back in a second.

506
00:37:19.417 --> 00:37:20.250
Please. do not hesitate

507
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:23.833
to contact local
authorities or us. here...

508
00:37:29.025 --> 00:37:30.123
- Viktoria. it's Darya.

509
00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.863
I'm so sorry to bother you.

510
00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.240
It's Jure. he's doing it again

511
00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.953
and I don't know what to do.

512
00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.713
Could you please call
me when you get this?

513
00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.409
Hey. Nico.

514
00:38:00.409 --> 00:38:01.777
- Hi.

515
00:38:01.777 --> 00:38:04.570
- I wanted to see if I could
take you up on that favor?

516
00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:06.010
- Yeah.

517
00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.370
- Just scored an interview at the Chateau.

518
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:09.360
The Red Room!

519
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.360
They wanna see me Sunday
after I finish up here.

520
00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.260
- Oh my god. congrats. that's amazing.

521
00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.580
Do you need me to watch the kids?

522
00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:16.680
- If you can?

523
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.513
- Of course.

524
00:38:17.513 --> 00:38:19.260
Like what time were you thinking?

525
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.723
- Like six or seven.

526
00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:22.870
- I can do seven.

527
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:24.220
- Oh. perfect.
- Okay.

528
00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.603
- Thank you so much.

529
00:38:26.742 --> 00:38:28.370
They're gonna be at my
neighbor. Liz's all day.

530
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:29.590
but she's got my keys.

531
00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.890
I'll text you her info.
- Okay. perfect.

532
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:32.757
All right.

533
00:38:32.757 --> 00:38:34.007
Thank you. bye.

534
00:38:49.239 --> 00:38:51.815
Nico. so
good to hear from you.

535
00:38:51.815 --> 00:38:53.330
Sorry to hear the news.

536
00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.040
I can be there tomorrow night.

537
00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.247
Be good to see you. even if
it's under these circumstances.

538
00:38:58.247 --> 00:38:59.920
Claudia says hello.

539
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.817
We all miss you.

540
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.100
See you tomorrow.

541
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.326
I'll see what I can do.

542
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:45.900
- Hi. Eddie.

543
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.200
- Hi. Nico.

544
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.310
Hey. so I can't get 'em right now.

545
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:52.400
Really sorry.

546
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.600
But it'd be like another 10 or 15 minutes.

547
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.990
- Don't worry. it's good.

548
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.823
- Okay. cool.

549
00:39:56.823 --> 00:39:58.300
I'll be back as soon as I can. okay?

550
00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:59.133
- Just text me when you're ready.

551
00:39:59.133 --> 00:40:00.910
- Oh. yeah. of course. see you in a bit.

552
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:01.743
- Bye.

553
00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:36.600

554
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.433
- No. thanks.

555
00:40:37.433 --> 00:40:38.900
I'm--
- You okay?

556
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.440
- I'm fine.

557
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.700
Is it okay I'm back here?

558
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.060
- There's a visitor's lounge if you want.

559
00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.710
- Oh. I'm just here meeting a friends.

560
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.890
You know her mom isn't doing well. so.

561
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:49.937
- That's nice of you.

562
00:40:49.937 --> 00:40:51.230
Do you know her mom's name?

563
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.630
Might be one of my patients.

564
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:55.730
- You know. I actually
don't know her that well.

565
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.453
she's just one of my coworkers.

566
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.190
I'm new to town.

567
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:01.290
- Same here.

568
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.690
Just transferred in from
Phoenix a few months ago.

569
00:41:05.497 --> 00:41:10.120
Hey. since we're both new here.

570
00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.563

571
00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.423
- Sure. yeah.

572
00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:18.040
That'd be nice.

573
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.320
- Great.

574
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.443
Here. let me get your number.

575
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.030

576
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.913
- Nico.

577
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.250
I'm sorry. I'm Raymond.

578
00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.580
How rude of me.

579
00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.663
- Dr. Raymond.

580
00:41:36.793 --> 00:41:38.143
I'm actually free tonight.

581
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:41.740
- I might not be done until midnight.

582
00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:42.593
- I'm up late.

583
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.520
It's actually the best time for me.

584
00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.839
- Yeah?

585
00:41:46.839 --> 00:41:47.672
- Yeah.

586
00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.429
- Now get in there. you've
got sick people that need you.

587
00:41:51.429 --> 00:41:53.410
- You're right.

588
00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.150
That sounds great.

589
00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:56.210
Call you tonight.

590
00:42:15.139 --> 00:42:16.860
- I filled it up with as
many as I could for you.

591
00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:17.693
- Thank you. Eddie.

592
00:42:17.693 --> 00:42:19.540
And there's a little extra in there

593
00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.500
'cause you know I really appreciate you

594
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.412
hooking me up with such short notice.

595
00:42:24.412 --> 00:42:25.482
- No problem.

596
00:42:25.482 --> 00:42:26.760
Do you want me to help
you take that to your car?

597
00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.593
- I got it.

598
00:42:27.593 --> 00:42:28.800
- Are you sure. it's heavy?

599
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.633
- I got it.

600
00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:31.813
Thank you.

601
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:33.523

- Yeah. I'm the guy.

607
00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.020

608
00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.253
- Let's do. I don't know. two hours.

609
00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:09.443
- That'll work.

610
00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:12.840
- What's your name. sweetie?

611
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.740
Cherry.

612
00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:16.500
I'll be right out here. huh?

613
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.333
- Come in.

614
00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:18.870
No. no. no. you ain't
gonna stay out there. man.

615
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:19.930
Come on.

616
00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.083
Make yourself at home.

617
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:24.623
Not like that. dude.

618
00:43:24.623 --> 00:43:26.926
Listen. me and the girl we
don't need the whole place.

619
00:43:26.926 --> 00:43:27.889
just the bedroom.

620
00:43:27.889 --> 00:43:30.197
You know what I mean?

621
00:43:30.197 --> 00:43:31.030
Come on.

622
00:43:33.487 --> 00:43:36.520
Can I get you some drinks and stuff.

623
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.353
This way.

624
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.460
Welcome.

625
00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.410
What can I get you?

626
00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.010
- I'll have that one.

627
00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.180
Good choice.

628
00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.630
- You got any Coke to mix it?

629
00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:52.363
- Let me see.

630
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:56.033
Yeah. but it looks flat.

631
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.033
You know what though?

632
00:43:58.033 --> 00:44:01.357
I have this. oh. where did it go?

633
00:44:01.357 --> 00:44:02.313
Ah. oh. here.

634
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:04.543
This guy.

635
00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.000
Are you cool with this?

636
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.460
- Yeah. I'm okay with that.

637
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.953
- All right. help yourself.

638
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:15.980
Make it a two?

639
00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.813
- Sure.

640
00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.820
- No ice.

641
00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.390
- You got it.

642
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.890
The girl likes it neat.

643
00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:29.723
Thank you.

644
00:44:29.723 --> 00:44:33.120
Hey. there's no reason
this whole arrangement

645
00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.570
shouldn't be friendly. right?

646
00:44:35.419 --> 00:44:36.394
Salut.

647
00:44:36.394 --> 00:44:37.227
- Salut.

648
00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.300

You know how the party. pass
it over. let me refill you.

650
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:56.710
How was that?

651
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:57.953
Wakes you right up.

652
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:09.623
- All right. shall we?

653
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:20.690
Hey. I don't have a TV. so just chill.

654
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:21.550
Feel at home.

655
00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:22.670
- I'm good.

656
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:23.503
- Okay.

657
00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:29.050
Also. if you want another
drink. I mean it's right there.

658
00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:30.050
Sounds good.

659
00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:33.650
See you in a bit.

660
00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:48.280
Hi.

661
00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.560
You changed outta your scrubs?

662
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.320
- Think this was more appropriate.

663
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.280
- The doctor look was sexy.

664
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.893
- Not after a few surgeries.

665
00:45:56.893 --> 00:45:57.913
- Even sexier.

666
00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.354
- Hi. there.

667
00:46:01.354 --> 00:46:02.904
Can I get you a drink to start?

668
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.520
- Just the water please.

669
00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.950
Are you good
with your Chianti. sir?

670
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:08.800
- Yes. thank you.

671
00:46:10.397 --> 00:46:11.280
You don't drink?

672
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.560
- I haven't in years.

673
00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.220
- Years?

674
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.630
What are you like 25?

675
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:17.763
- Give or take a few.

676
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.412
- How is your friend doing. her mom?

677
00:46:21.412 --> 00:46:23.290
- You know she's she's good. she's okay.

678
00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:26.120
She's just getting old and--

679
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.494
Here you are.

680
00:46:27.494 --> 00:46:28.327
Thank you.

681
00:46:28.327 --> 00:46:29.420
Are we ready to order?

682
00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:33.030
- Actually I already ate.
I'm sorry. I couldn't wait.

683
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:34.340
Cheap date. right?

684
00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:35.290
- You mind if I?

685
00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:36.610
- Of course.

686
00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:38.030
- I'll have a porterhouse medium rare.

687
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:39.210
We'll put it in for you now.

688
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:40.043
Thank you.

- Quite a girl you got there.

692
00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:07.483
Oldest profession in the world.

693
00:47:08.838 --> 00:47:09.980
That's what they say.

694
00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.130
Good to know that some
things never change.

695
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:17.203
All right. baby. want some?

696
00:47:20.005 --> 00:47:21.172
Be right back.

697
00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.063
Hey you got any more girls?

698
00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.360
- Yeah. I got a few.

699
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:33.804

00:47:34.637 --> 00:47:36.010
- No. no. I insist.

702
00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:37.233
This is the best stuff.

703
00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.013
Import straight from my homeland.

704
00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.003
Are you not going to even try it?

705
00:47:47.723 --> 00:47:48.923
- I'll get around to it.

706
00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:55.903
- Okay.

707
00:48:13.823 --> 00:48:15.240
- Hey. how are you doing?

708
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.060
Sorry to keep you a wait. but me and Jim.

709
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.150
we had to do a shot.

710
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:19.923
You know. boys will be boys.

711
00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:22.620
Gotta try this.

712
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.003
It's really good stuff from my homeland.

713
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.440
All good.

714
00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.613
I'll be right back.

715
00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:42.300
Wake up. I've gotta get some more in you.

716
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.024
Come on. drink. drink that.

717
00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.940
So tell me about your ex?

718
00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.070
- Well. she said I wasn't exciting.

719
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:10.680
Didn't have swagger.

720
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.513
- Wow.

721
00:49:11.513 --> 00:49:12.730
- She actually wanted to
stay together after that.

722
00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:14.740
But I couldn't.

723
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:16.690
- Of course. they always do don't they?

724
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:19.650
My ex wouldn't let go either.

725
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:22.560
Talk about swagger.
all he had was swagger.

726
00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.090
- We should pair them up.

727
00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:25.600
It seems like they'd be a good match.

728
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.930
- Maybe.

729
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.491
You know. I would not wish him on anyone.

730
00:49:38.635 --> 00:49:40.968
See you Sunday. Dr. Raymond.

731
00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.090
Damn boy.

732
00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:17.493
I'm gonna be feeling
that all day tomorrow.

733
00:50:20.258 --> 00:50:22.758
Oh. that was amazing.

734
00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.843
So where are you from?

735
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:38.130
- Around here.

736
00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:39.023
Nowhere special.

737
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.690
What's your ancestry?

738
00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:44.210
- I'm native.

739
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:47.000
My family's indigenous to the land here.

740
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:47.833
Really?

741
00:50:47.833 --> 00:50:48.666
- Huh-uh.

742
00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:53.460
- You know. it has been a really long time

743
00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.563
since I've been with a native. like you.

744
00:50:56.405 --> 00:50:58.198
- Yeah.

745
00:50:58.198 --> 00:50:59.670
- Yeah.

746
00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:03.723
I have really fond memories of
my time amongst your people.

747
00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:07.520
So many amazing adventures.

748
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.570
Shame what happened. you know.

749
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:10.573
Those fucking Spaniards. man.

750
00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:15.494
- Well. it was a really long time ago.

751
00:51:15.494 --> 00:51:18.473
- Yeah. it was. it was a simpler time.

752
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:23.090
Back then. you could've
taken a whole village.

753
00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:24.440
Everybody.

754
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.253
People would blame evil spirits
and ghosts and whatever.

755
00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.830
Nowadays. you've got all of
these forensics and police

756
00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:35.743
and military and investigations.

757
00:51:38.253 --> 00:51:39.490
You gotta tread lightly.

758
00:51:40.573 --> 00:51:41.790
Can't go wild anymore.

759
00:51:44.058 --> 00:51:45.608
I don't know how Darya does it.

760
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:48.640
If I go without hunting for a while.

761
00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.620
I just get depressed.

762
00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.890
I mean. what's the point. really?

763
00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:56.240
I did go without hunting
once for like 10 days.

764
00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.453
but just get the cranky.

765
00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:00.520
Become a real bastard.

766
00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:04.140
- You've been real nice. Joe.

767
00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.520
But I think we've gone
more than two hours.

768
00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:07.893
Jim's gonna be asking.

769
00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:10.910
- I'm sorry I'm rambling but you know.

770
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:14.153
I don't get to talk to
people a lot nowadays.

771
00:52:14.153 --> 00:52:15.683
- It's okay.

772
00:52:15.683 --> 00:52:18.183
I just really gotta get going.

773
00:52:20.203 --> 00:52:22.120
- It's okay. I'm sorry.

774
00:52:23.215 --> 00:52:24.665
It's time.

775
00:52:24.665 --> 00:52:25.607
- Jim!

776
00:52:25.607 --> 00:52:26.440
I'll make it quick. I promise.

777
00:54:21.907 --> 00:54:26.407
Oh my god. I don't
think I can do it anymore.

778
00:54:31.093 --> 00:54:32.653
- Is that your boy over there?

779
00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:37.460
- Oh. Mike. shit. I
completely forgot about him.

780
00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:38.730
- Oh. you got his name.

781
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:39.834
How formal of you.

782
00:54:39.834 --> 00:54:41.500
- Yeah. I'm old fashioned that way.

783
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.500
- He was here last night. looking for ya.

784
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.078
Told him you were in tonight.

785
00:54:45.078 --> 00:54:45.911
- Oh.

786
00:54:45.911 --> 00:54:49.280
- It is his last night
here. have some fun. girl.

787
00:54:58.310 --> 00:55:01.532
This is how I introduce
myself. I go. oh. big Mike.

788
00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:03.510
- You got some friends with you. huh?

789
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:06.400
- Hey. Nico. this is
Paul and this is Greg.

790
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.800
- Ooh. she is real good.

791
00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.660
Good for you. Mike.

792
00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:12.260
- Well. good to meet you fellas.

793
00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:13.940
What can I get for ya?

794
00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.340
- I'll have a tequila.

795
00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.600
Thanks. sweetie.

796
00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.433
- Lager.

797
00:55:17.433 --> 00:55:18.892
And I'll have a whiskey.

798
00:55:18.892 --> 00:55:19.792
- Coming right up.

799
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.390
- Gentlemen. I will be right back.

800
00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.210
You dog.

801
00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:30.873
He's making me
second guess my marriage.

802
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.020
- Hey. what happened last night?

803
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:35.920
- Something came up. nothing personal.

804
00:55:37.673 --> 00:55:38.573
Friends from work?

805
00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.530
- Vendors from the convention.

806
00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:43.580
Doing a little schmoozing. you know.

807
00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:46.530
the wine and dine business stuff.

808
00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:47.457
Plus I didn't know if you'd be here

809
00:55:47.457 --> 00:55:50.070
and I didn't want to sit here
by myself drinking again.

810
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:51.320
- Well. I'm here tonight.

811
00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.010
- Are we still on?

812
00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:54.943
- Yeah. sure.

813
00:55:56.110 --> 00:55:58.610
Just don't get too many
of these again. all right?

814
00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:05.913
Come on. get up.

815
00:56:07.407 --> 00:56:08.760
- I'm up. I'm up.

816
00:56:10.927 --> 00:56:12.738
You guys are killing me.

817
00:56:12.738 --> 00:56:14.050
It's not even two yet.

818
00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:16.063
- Nobody can ride like you Mike.

819
00:56:16.063 --> 00:56:17.646
- I'm out. I'm out.

820
00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.297
Where are you going?

821
00:56:20.297 --> 00:56:21.247
Calling a night.

822
00:56:21.247 --> 00:56:22.300
It's not even two yet.

823
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.133
Party animals?

824
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:26.550
- I'll be in touch about those orders.

825
00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:28.943
Paul. have fun with your hottie. bigshot.

826
00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.860
Wanna hear the play by play.

827
00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:32.730
See you at the airport.

828
00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:34.320
All right. my man.

829
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.423
Get up there and...

830
00:56:36.677 --> 00:56:37.703
And there were two.

831
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.310
Last call.

832
00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:42.143
- You good?

833
00:56:42.143 --> 00:56:43.621
- I'm good. I'm just gonna finish this.

834
00:56:43.621 --> 00:56:44.454
- Yeah. me too.

835
00:56:44.454 --> 00:56:45.410
- There you go.

836
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:46.610
- No. man. let me get it.
- No.

837
00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:48.599
Stop. stop.
- Let me get it.

838
00:56:48.599 --> 00:56:49.432
- Let me get this for you. okay. man.

839
00:56:49.432 --> 00:56:50.620
Just give me a deal on those orders. okay?

840
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:52.010
Nine and a half foot umbrellas.

841
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:55.023
Aluminum.
- Yeah. yeah. you got it.

842
00:56:56.970 --> 00:57:00.550
So. Nico. got any friends?

843
00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:02.170
It's my last night in town.

844
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.080
- None your type. I'm sorry.

845
00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:07.730
- If you think of anyone.
hook a brother up?

846
00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:08.940
- Absolutely.

847
00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.010
- See you upstairs?

848
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:12.170
- Yeah.
- Six one three.

849
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:13.003
- Got it.

850
00:57:15.957 --> 00:57:17.301
You're an animal.

851
00:57:29.385 --> 00:57:30.696
Are you getting close?

852
00:57:30.696 --> 00:57:31.779
- Let me try.

853
00:57:44.626 --> 00:57:48.459
Shit. come on.
only had three drinks.

854
00:57:49.426 --> 00:57:50.259
- Four.

855
00:57:52.728 --> 00:57:53.728
Just breathe.

856
01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.100
Look who's here.

857
01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:02.320
Viktoria.

858
01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.920
- Darya.

859
01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.283
Give your sister hug.

860
01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:10.100
- It's been far too long.

861
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.720
Let me take your bag.

862
01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.750
You look
more radiant than ever.

863
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:17.393
You too. ravishing as always.

864
01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:21.240
- This is a cute place you have.

865
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.620
- Yeah. cute. right?

866
01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.240
I bet Claudia's shoe closet is bigger.

867
01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.410
- Oh. come on. it's nice.

868
01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:29.220
- Well. thank you.

869
01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.030
Can I get you anything?

870
01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:32.863
- Hm. yes. please.

871
01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.123
- Cheers.

872
01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:48.490
- To family.

873
01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:52.093
Oh. maybe not by blood.
but you are by love.

874
01:03:53.110 --> 01:03:53.943
- Family.

875
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:03.920
Make yourself at home.

876
01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.693
- Oh. I've been sitting forever.

877
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:12.390
I made it just in time. didn't I?

878
01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.000
- So how are you and Claudia?

879
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.920
- Claudia is wonderful.

880
01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.140
She misses you. of course.

881
01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:21.480
- I owe her a call.

882
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.270
- Yes you do.

883
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:26.081
It would make a very
happy to hear from you.

884
01:04:26.081 --> 01:04:27.290
We're in Greece now.

885
01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:29.690
A lovely villa in Kithnos.

886
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:31.290
It reminds Claudia of Cartagena.

887
01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:35.910
The Greeks are in such
a sad state of affairs

888
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:39.910
with refugees and strife.
it's perfect for us.

889
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:40.893
- How is mom?

890
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:43.660
- Same as always.

891
01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:45.113
- Holed away in her castle?

892
01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:48.810
- At this point. it's
practically a mausoleum.

893
01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:50.850
She still keeps it up though.

894
01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:53.720
- I do love her beautiful Baroque decor.

895
01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.063
- Stuffy. I say.

896
01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.323
She won't like me updated for her.

897
01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:01.190
I think when Rococo came around.

898
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:03.770
she swore off new fashions forever.

899
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:06.520
- We know where your brother
got his stubbornness from.

900
01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:09.563
- Speak of the devil.

901
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:12.940
What's he done this time?

902
01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:14.890
- Same crap.

903
01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:16.340
I just started getting settled here

904
01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.853
and he shows up to ruin it again.

905
01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:30.100
- He means well. Darya.

906
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.010
He just struggles to
think of others sometimes.

907
01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:34.110
- He needs to move on.

908
01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:35.903
It's over.

909
01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:41.050
- I will speak to him tonight.

910
01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:43.203
Don't worry.

911
01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:45.893
Everything will work itself out.

912
01:05:47.092 --> 01:05:48.925
- Thank you. Viktoria.

913
01:05:52.067 --> 01:05:53.860
- You smell delightful.

914
01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.693
Is that Dior?

915
01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.673
- Faux.

916
01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:58.853
- Fooled me.

917
01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:26.223
- It's fresh. I just
picked it up yesterday.

918
01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.150
- Look at you.

919
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:30.893
Awfully formal for babysitting?

920
01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.173
It's okay to move on.

921
01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:37.883
Find new passions.

922
01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.890
- It's been so long.

923
01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:41.853
It's weird.

924
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:44.053
- It's natural.

925
01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:47.513
- I have no idea how any of this works.

926
01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:51.853
- You have a choice now.
you'll get used to it.

927
01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:54.380
- Don't tell Jure. please.

928
01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:55.780
- Of course not.

929
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.143
It's none of his business.

930
01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:01.500
Just don't tell Claudia
about the choice thing.

931
01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.674
I don't want her getting any ideas.

932
01:07:03.674 --> 01:07:04.507
- I won't.

933
01:07:07.793 --> 01:07:09.460
I'm gonna get going.

934
01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:14.640
- I will see you before I leave. right?

935
01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.483
- Definitely.

936
01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:18.930
Come by my work if you like.
I'll be there tomorrow.

937
01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.130
What's this?

938
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:23.183
- Claudia insisted.

939
01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.403
- Jesus. Viktoria. I can't.

940
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.133
- Come visit us and get some real Dior.

941
01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.549
- Thank you. but I really can't. I can't.

942
01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:38.223
- Dear. I know you don't like to ask.

943
01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.480
but we have to help each other out.

944
01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.030
It's how we survived this long.

945
01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:45.056
Find your own path.

946
01:07:45.056 --> 01:07:47.713
but know we're always here for you. Darya.

947
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:50.090
Please.

948
01:07:50.090 --> 01:07:51.090
Don't be a stranger.

949
01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.653
- Thank you. Viktoria.

950
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:55.443
I promise.

951
01:07:56.954 --> 01:07:57.787
I promise.

952
01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:04.793
- Have fun.

953
01:08:05.917 --> 01:08:07.113
- I will.

954
01:08:08.308 --> 01:08:09.914
Bye.

955
01:08:20.230 --> 01:08:22.110
Hi. Liz. I'm Nico.

956
01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:22.943
Oh. yeah.

957
01:08:22.943 --> 01:08:23.800
The kids were in the back bedroom.

958
01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.633
- Thanks.

959
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:28.218
Janet says you've been a real lifesaver.

960
01:08:28.218 --> 01:08:29.920
You have no idea how grateful she is.

961
01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.870
- Oh. it's no bother.

962
01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:33.420
I mean I'm home most of the days anyway.

963
01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:35.780
Sophia. Mackenzie. your
mama's friends here

964
01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:36.790
to take you home.

965
01:08:37.623 --> 01:08:38.456
They've already eaten.

966
01:08:38.456 --> 01:08:39.873
I know. we hate goodbyes.

967
01:08:43.248 --> 01:08:44.081
Say goodbye.

968
01:08:44.081 --> 01:08:44.987
- Bye.
- Bye.

969
01:08:44.987 --> 01:08:47.170
All right. you two.
we should start cleaning up

970
01:08:47.170 --> 01:08:48.440
and then get ready for bed. okay?

971
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:52.340
I sleep on the floor.

972
01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:54.990
- You can clean up.
- You're helping.

973
01:09:15.555 --> 01:09:17.163
- I'm back a little early.

974
01:09:17.163 --> 01:09:18.185
How did it go?

975
01:09:18.185 --> 01:09:19.518
- Good. I think.

976
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.493
How were they?

977
01:09:22.493 --> 01:09:23.410
- Angels.

978
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.653
- Hi. sweetie.

979
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:28.227
You and Nico have fun?

980
01:09:28.227 --> 01:09:29.163
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

981
01:09:32.774 --> 01:09:34.080
- They're so adorable.

982
01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.113
- Yeah. I got lucky with them.

983
01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:40.480
- All right. I'm gonna get going.

984
01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:41.313
Goodnight.

985
01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.580
Jure?

986
01:10:29.346 --> 01:10:31.238
Vik. is that you?

987
01:10:31.238 --> 01:10:33.238
What are you doing here?

988
01:10:35.104 --> 01:10:36.503
- Is this how you live now?

989
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:38.933
Like a dirty pig?

990
01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:47.977
Why are you here?

991
01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:48.813
Huh?

992
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:53.080
- This guy is turning.

993
01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.393
You know that. right?

994
01:10:55.792 --> 01:10:57.459
- Vik. damn it. Vik.

995
01:10:58.717 --> 01:11:00.813
Vik. I was still drinking that.

996
01:11:05.499 --> 01:11:07.756
- Go and clean yourself up.

997
01:11:07.756 --> 01:11:09.583
And put on some fucking clothes.

998
01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:12.173
All right.

999
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.810
- Where do you put these things?

1000
01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:34.030
- It's out back. behind the fence.

1001
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:35.083
I'll fucking get it.

1002
01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:37.373
- They stink.

1003
01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:39.930
So do you.

1004
01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:41.390
Clean yourself up.

1005
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:42.340
All right.

1006
01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:59.130
- Nico. oh my god. look at you.

1007
01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:00.510
- Look at you.

1008
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:02.320
- I thought we were
meeting at the restaurant?

1009
01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:05.490
- I was done early and there's
a movie I wanna catch. so.

1010
01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:07.370
- If I'd have known.
I would've cleaned up.

1011
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:09.510
- Nonsense. come on. if we leave here now.

1012
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:11.680
we can't catch the 10 o'clock show.

1013
01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.080
Come on. I want a good seat.

1014
01:12:27.702 --> 01:12:30.369
Your hand is frigid.

1015
01:12:32.368 --> 01:12:35.618
I've got terrible circulation.

1016
01:12:56.273 --> 01:12:58.523
- What is this John Wayne look?

1017
01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:00.630
- John Wayne?

1018
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:03.823
It's not John Wayne. it's
Rob Zombie. if anything.

1019
01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.390
- I don't know this Zombie.

1020
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:09.980
It's silly.

1021
01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:12.810
- Well. it's better than
whatever the hell you're wearing.

1022
01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:15.160
God. why would you throw that guy out?

1023
01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.440
- He'd turned.

1024
01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.667
- He was fine.

1025
01:13:17.667 --> 01:13:20.183
Did you see him. he had
like two days left in him.

1026
01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:24.603
- I spoke to mom.

1027
01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.640
She agreed. if you do
not clean yourself up.

1028
01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.993
she's going to cut you off.

1029
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.190
She won't support you the
way that you're going.

1030
01:13:33.190 --> 01:13:34.850
You worry us. Jure.

1031
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:35.840
- Great.

1032
01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.090
Is that when you're here?

1033
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:40.900
- Come stay with Claudia and me.

1034
01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.330
You'll love it.

1035
01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:44.690
It's beautiful. lively.

1036
01:13:44.690 --> 01:13:47.060
And there's so many
refugees washing ashore.

1037
01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:48.750
It's like a buffet.

1038
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:50.363
- I don't care. I'm not leaving.

1039
01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.590
- You can't keep chasing Darya around.

1040
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:54.423
Let go.

1041
01:13:54.423 --> 01:13:56.070
- Did you see Darya?

1042
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:57.870
No. look at me. did you talk to her?

1043
01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:02.130
- If you want to ruin your
life. it's your choice.

1044
01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:03.790
but do not ruin hers.

1045
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:05.233
Or ours for that matter.

1046
01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.020
You're on the news.

1047
01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.510
This isn't the old days.

1048
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:10.840
- I know.

1049
01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.630
- That's what pisses me off.

1050
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:13.970
You're like dad.

1051
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:16.470
The only thing you care about
more than us is yourself.

1052
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:17.610
- Well. you're wrong

1053
01:14:17.610 --> 01:14:19.920
because I love Darya more than anything.

1054
01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.690
- Bullshit.

1055
01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:24.570
If you really cared about
her. you'd stop all this.

1056
01:14:24.570 --> 01:14:26.490
Stop hurting her.

1057
01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:28.703
And maybe you'll stop
hurting yourself too.

1058
01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.563
My baby brother.

1059
01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.283
What am I going to do with you?

1060
01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.670
No more talk of this.

1061
01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:52.540
Come on. I've got a suite
at the Royal Chateau.

1062
01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:54.690
Stay in the guest room.

1063
01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:57.933
I want to spend some time with
my cowboy Zombie Bob brother.

1064
01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:03.260
Dying inside.

1065
01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:04.210
Come on.

1066
01:15:06.278 --> 01:15:07.628
This is fucking horse-shit!

1067
01:15:09.043 --> 01:15:09.876
Fuck

1068
01:15:10.831 --> 01:15:12.498
- It's not that bad.

1069
01:15:16.819 --> 01:15:18.240
Can I get you anything?

1070
01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.150
- No.

1071
01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:20.293
Well. just you.

1072
01:15:26.177 --> 01:15:29.107
Are you
watching all this. sweetie?

1073
01:15:29.107 --> 01:15:32.910
All unfolding. right here
before our very eyes.

1074
01:16:39.007 --> 01:16:40.195
Let's go.

1075
01:16:40.195 --> 01:16:41.028
- It's almost over.

1076
01:16:41.028 --> 01:16:44.528
I've got a better ending in mind.

1077
01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:16.743
I swear this stuff.

1078
01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:21.850
never does it for me.

1079
01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:24.143
No matter how much I
drink. I'm still hungry.

1080
01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:26.740
- You've got to give it time

1081
01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:29.240
and let your system get used to it.

1082
01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:32.160
- Please let me ease into this.

1083
01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.390
- Ease in?

1084
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:35.450
You haven't even had one yet.

1085
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:38.760
- Viktoria. this is special occasion.

1086
01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:42.773
When was the last time you and
me went on a hunt together?

1087
01:18:44.610 --> 01:18:45.573
10 years?

1088
01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.313
- Probably.

1089
01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:49.973
The Philippines. I think.

1090
01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:55.090
We can't. you've done enough here already.

1091
01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:57.240
- A couple of vagrants or something.

1092
01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.113
- Vagrants?

1093
01:18:59.169 --> 01:19:01.419
Is that what you think
a special occasion is?

1094
01:19:02.254 --> 01:19:03.790
You insult me.

1095
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:05.860
- Okay. some tourists.

1096
01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:06.820
We can do that.

1097
01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:08.750
Vegas is just a short drive from here

1098
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:10.910
and you know what they say?

1099
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:11.970
What happens in Vegas?

1100
01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:12.803
- No.

1101
01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.000
- How about a little spot off the freeway

1102
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.513
in the middle of nowhere.

1103
01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:25.483
Come on. me and you?

1104
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:28.170
Like in the good old times.

1105
01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.373
- You promise to clean yourself up?

1106
01:19:33.297 --> 01:19:35.220
- A million percent. I will.

1107
01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:36.290
- Are you sure?

1108
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:37.190
- I swear. I will.

1109
01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:45.763
- Find a good spot.

1110
01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:49.460
Middle of nowhere.

1111
01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:50.803
- Middle of nowhere.

1112
01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:53.173
I swear.

1113
01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:20.610
- Follow your lead.

1114
01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:23.780
- Like you always do.

1115
01:20:35.016 --> 01:20:36.840
- We're just closing.

1116
01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.363
- We'll just have one drink
and we'll be on our way.

1117
01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:42.000
- Make it quick.

1118
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:42.833
What do you want?

1119
01:20:42.833 --> 01:20:44.550
- A celebratory drink.

1120
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:48.220
I struck it real rich tonight
at roulette table. so.

1121
01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:49.930
We'd like to buy a round of drinks

1122
01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:51.530
for the gentlemen in this bar.

1123
01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:55.298
Please. guys. whatever
y'all want. it's on me.

1124
01:21:01.776 --> 01:21:03.409
- Whiskey.

1125
01:21:03.409 --> 01:21:04.242
- Whiskey.

1126
01:21:05.857 --> 01:21:07.346
I'll have vodka.

1127
01:21:07.346 --> 01:21:08.396
- I'll have the same.

1128
01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:28.833
- It's all cowboy shit.

1129
01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:31.250
- It'll grow on you.

1130
01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:34.333
Try this one.

1131
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:37.050
- You do it.

1132
01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:49.130
- For passion for life.
which leaves no regrets.

1133
01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:51.350
For living with great
passion is the only deed

1134
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:56.183
which can bring us peace in
the face of mortality specter.

1135
01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.059
- Well said. sis.

1136
01:21:59.059 --> 01:22:00.909
- Danged fruits.

1137
01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.131
- Excuse me. can we
please have another drink

1138
01:22:05.131 --> 01:22:06.793
for our friend over here.

1139
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:09.493
- Last one. we're closed.

1140
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:14.013
- Hey. buddy. this my sister.
she's visiting from Europe.

1141
01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:18.473
She's not familiar with your simple ways.

1142
01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:23.840
- I don't want that.

1143
01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:29.603
- Please. do not turn away
my brother's generosity.

1144
01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.750
- All right. all right. closing time.

1145
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:34.060
Come on. let's go you two.

1146
01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:35.910
- We haven't even had our drinks yet.

1147
01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.890
- Look. I'm not asking you.

1148
01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:42.913
I'm telling you two fuck-wads to go.

1149
01:22:45.084 --> 01:22:46.084
- All right.

1150
01:22:52.670 --> 01:22:54.353
- Should've had that drink.

1151
01:23:45.676 --> 01:23:47.509
- Argh. don't want it.

1152
01:24:02.658 --> 01:24:03.991
Cheers.

1153
01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:10.120
- Of all the places.

1154
01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.520
What made her move out here?

1155
01:24:13.207 --> 01:24:14.903
- She always liked the lights.

1156
01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:20.770
Times Square. Shinjuku. Vegas.
you know. places like that.

1157
01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:26.313
She said that it's almost
like having sunlight again.

1158
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:31.370
- Seems vulgar to me.

1159
01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:33.520
- To me too. you know. but that's just one

1160
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.670
of the many things we
could never agree on.

1161
01:24:36.610 --> 01:24:39.143
You see. I just wanted
the little simpler life.

1162
01:24:39.143 --> 01:24:41.468
the two of us. you know.

1163
01:24:41.468 --> 01:24:44.453
To do some hunting. to make love.

1164
01:24:45.391 --> 01:24:49.173
But Darya. she just wants
to be around people.

1165
01:24:50.226 --> 01:24:51.720
I don't know why.

1166
01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.780
Yeah. she never really
had a stomach for hunting.

1167
01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:56.510
- She went on hunts with us?

1168
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:57.840
She'd have done this.

1169
01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.290
- Well. yeah. these guys of course.

1170
01:25:01.290 --> 01:25:03.260
She's really picky. though.

1171
01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:05.303
No women. no children.

1172
01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:07.850
She wouldn't do it.

1173
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:10.280
Gets really mad when I do it. so.

1174
01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.751
- Makes sense when you think about it.

1175
01:25:12.751 --> 01:25:14.073
- Yeah. I mean. I get it.

1176
01:25:14.073 --> 01:25:16.620
Like I can see her going after

1177
01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:18.190
some little pet or something.

1178
01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:19.647
I can see that.

1179
01:25:19.647 --> 01:25:20.757
But the mass of 'em.

1180
01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:23.623
- You really don't get it.

1181
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:27.509
Put yourself in her place.

1182
01:25:27.509 --> 01:25:29.460
She had a family before she turned.

1183
01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:30.567
She still holds onto that--

1184
01:25:30.567 --> 01:25:31.920
- Oh. please. stop with that.

1185
01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:32.753
You know what?

1186
01:25:32.753 --> 01:25:34.910
That was so long ago she
needs to get over it already.

1187
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:35.743
Come on.

1188
01:25:35.743 --> 01:25:39.650
- Jure. she watched us do
this to her whole family.

1189
01:25:39.650 --> 01:25:42.830
- Viktoria. I saved her.

1190
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:45.407
Don't you think that I should
get some gratitude for that?

1191
01:25:45.407 --> 01:25:49.540
She'd be dead a long
time ago without me. me.

1192
01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:53.690
- Jesus. Jure. her kids. her parents.

1193
01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:58.111
her husband. her whole village.
you took that from her.

1194
01:25:58.111 --> 01:25:59.600
That can leave a scar.

1195
01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:02.080
- Okay. how about you and Claudia?

1196
01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:04.410
She doesn't seem to hold a grudge at all.

1197
01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:07.390
She didn't have a family
when I turned her.

1198
01:26:07.390 --> 01:26:09.006
- You killed her husband.

1199
01:26:09.006 --> 01:26:10.856
- He was a dick.

1200
01:26:10.856 --> 01:26:11.689
- He was?

1201
01:26:11.689 --> 01:26:13.000
- Total dick.

1202
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:13.990
- I didn't know that.

1203
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.823
- Yes you do.

1204
01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:18.920
He was the Spanish Viceroy. remember?

1205
01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:23.223
- Right. those guys were dicks.

1206
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:28.050
- He messed her head up so bad.

1207
01:26:28.050 --> 01:26:29.823
She still has trust issues.

1208
01:26:31.530 --> 01:26:36.020
Which reminds me. just letting
her know what we're up to.

1209
01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:40.407
Seriously. that woman she thinks
I'm always sleeping around.

1210
01:26:41.650 --> 01:26:43.073
Her temper is ferocious.

1211
01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.170
- Is this is the last one?

1212
01:26:46.170 --> 01:26:48.303
- Yep. we drained them all.

1213
01:26:51.247 --> 01:26:54.747
- It's all just
repetitions of repetitions.

1214
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:56.911
Isn't it?

1215
01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:59.930
- Round and round. ups and downs.

1216
01:26:59.930 --> 01:27:02.163
- It's all pointless.

1217
01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.740
- If you only think about yourself.

1218
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:08.239
Sure.

1219
01:27:08.239 --> 01:27:09.110
- I don't think about myself.

1220
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:11.740
Listen. I gave everything to Darya.

1221
01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:14.180
I treated that woman like a goddess

1222
01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:15.236
and you know this.

1223
01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.290
- She's not a goddess. she's a person.

1224
01:27:20.290 --> 01:27:22.130
Gods are what you make up in your mind.

1225
01:27:22.130 --> 01:27:23.843
They're what you wish them to be.

1226
01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:28.390
Darya. she is who she is.

1227
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:29.773
Not who you wish her to be.

1228
01:27:32.722 --> 01:27:34.913
- You know. you and Claudia.

1229
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:40.290
you have your art. you have your music.

1230
01:27:40.290 --> 01:27:41.290
you have each other.

1231
01:27:42.968 --> 01:27:45.453
I was always this. this adventure guy.

1232
01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.483
she was the only anchor I have.

1233
01:27:50.421 --> 01:27:54.093
And now. I'm just drifting.

1234
01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.993
- And she set you both free.

1235
01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:00.567
She's scared too.

1236
01:28:01.650 --> 01:28:03.347
Think about it.

1237
01:28:03.347 --> 01:28:07.520
Little village girl. married
off. raising a family

1238
01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.423
and then with you.

1239
01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:12.173
Now she's all alone in this strange time.

1240
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:15.503
But she'll find her way and so will you.

1241
01:28:16.389 --> 01:28:18.683
- Yeah. I guess she will.

1242
01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.690
She's got a whole new life to find.

1243
01:28:23.690 --> 01:28:25.270
I've been there. done that.

1244
01:28:26.447 --> 01:28:27.693
Look at me now.

1245
01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.031
What do I have now?

1246
01:28:34.031 --> 01:28:35.470
- I don't know.

1247
01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:37.522
You have your terrible taste in music.

1248
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:41.920
- Fuck you.

1249
01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:45.170
- Seriously. you like this cowboy garbage?

1250
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:46.143
- It's not growing on you?

1251
01:28:46.143 --> 01:28:47.960
- It's growing on my nerves.

1252
01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.403
I won't let you become like mom.

1253
01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.460
And I won't let you go out like dad did.

1254
01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:02.110
You can't do that to us.

1255
01:29:02.110 --> 01:29:04.450
We won't win that war.

1256
01:29:04.450 --> 01:29:06.250
Not in the time that we live in now.

1257
01:29:07.690 --> 01:29:09.183
- It's not like it used to be.

1258
01:29:09.183 --> 01:29:10.953
peasants with pitchforks.

1259
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:14.563
- It's a strange time we live in.

1260
01:29:16.330 --> 01:29:19.003
Nowadays. a person can change anything.

1261
01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:23.030
Religion. social caste. politics.

1262
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:24.450
Hair. boobs. butt.

1263
01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:25.393
Your gender even!

1264
01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:30.150
But the one thing we cannot change

1265
01:29:30.150 --> 01:29:32.070
is the time we're in.

1266
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:33.960
It's not all bad though.

1267
01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.420
Claudia and I don't have
to sneak around anymore.

1268
01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:37.513
it's been nice.

1269
01:29:40.162 --> 01:29:44.060
- You know. I was thinking
maybe we just keep going

1270
01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:47.560
because we feel like
our story's never over.

1271
01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:50.207
Maybe I did have my happy ending.

1272
01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:54.530
And now I'm just in the blank pages.

1273
01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:56.250
somewhere in the back of the book

1274
01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:58.350
thinking what's coming next.

1275
01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:00.750
- There are no endings. Jure.

1276
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:03.040
It's just cycles.

1277
01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.250
Listen. it's your choice.

1278
01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:08.050
Destruction or creation?

1279
01:30:08.050 --> 01:30:10.503
Vengeance or forgiveness.

1280
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:16.463
- How about apathy?

1281
01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:20.150
- Yeah.

1282
01:30:20.150 --> 01:30:20.983
- Apathy.

1283
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:24.760
- Pack your bags tonight?

1284
01:30:29.230 --> 01:30:30.400
- I guess so.

1285
01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:31.840
- Good.

1286
01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:34.520
Claudia already has the bungalow made up.

1287
01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.297
She's excited to see you.

1288
01:30:40.703 --> 01:30:42.286
All right. come on.

1289
01:30:52.572 --> 01:30:54.368
I fucking missed you.

1290
01:30:54.368 --> 01:30:56.868
I missed you too.

1291
01:31:02.576 --> 01:31:04.688
Nico?

1292
01:31:04.688 --> 01:31:05.638
Nico. are you okay?

1293
01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:13.780
You're cold.

1294
01:31:14.831 --> 01:31:16.895
- You gonna warm me up again?

1295
01:31:16.895 --> 01:31:18.728
- I mean it. you're...

1296
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:27.583
- Then fix me. doctor.

1297
01:32:13.692 --> 01:32:15.910
- I'm sorry. I can't make you breakfast.

1298
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:18.070
I seriously have nothing in the fridge.

1299
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:19.910
Don't worry.
I'll hit up the cafeteria

1300
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:21.260
when I get to the hospital.

1301
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:24.610
Can I drive you in?

1302
01:32:24.610 --> 01:32:26.003
Your car's still there.

1303
01:32:28.441 --> 01:32:29.940
- No. thanks.

1304
01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.423
I'm gonna get some more rest.

1305
01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:34.673
I'm sorry you have to go in already.

1306
01:32:36.409 --> 01:32:38.200
I barely let you sleep.

1307
01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.450
- If I get tired. I'll just think of you

1308
01:32:40.450 --> 01:32:42.924
and that'll get my heart racing again.

1309
01:32:43.757 --> 01:32:44.590
- Really?

1310
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:46.590
Could you be any sweeter?

1311
01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:49.010
You know. if you aren't careful enough.

1312
01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:50.940
you might get stuck with me.

1313
01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:51.863
- I plan on it.

1314
01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:56.130
And I'm going to take
you grocery shopping.

1315
01:32:56.130 --> 01:32:57.980
We're going to get some
good food in here for you.

1316
01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:00.560
- Or I could just keep eating you up.

1317
01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.160
- You can't live on me alone.

1318
01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:04.500
- Sure. I could.

1319
01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:05.380
- If you're gonna keep me around.

1320
01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:08.450
you're gonna have to get used
to me taking care of you.

1321
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:10.500
It's what I do.

1322
01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.700
- I've done fine this
long. don't you think?

1323
01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:14.553
Right?

1324
01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:18.040
- Even when the outside looks perfect.

1325
01:33:20.210 --> 01:33:22.623
you'd be surprised what
can be going on inside.

1326
01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:28.560
I don't mean to pry. but that's what I do.

1327
01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.453
I'm a surgeon.

1328
01:33:31.290 --> 01:33:32.800
When was the last time
you went to the doctor

1329
01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:33.800
and got checked out?

1330
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:38.623
- About 10 minutes ago.
if I'm not mistaken.

1331
01:33:42.330 --> 01:33:44.330
- Your low temperature. your pulse rate.

1332
01:33:46.730 --> 01:33:47.630
they're not right.

1333
01:33:48.726 --> 01:33:52.813
And the toothbrush I
noticed red on the bristles.

1334
01:33:53.770 --> 01:33:57.913
Nico. it's not just circulation.

1335
01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:02.760
You can't ignore these things.
hoping they'll go away.

1336
01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.610
You got a long life ahead of you.

1337
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:08.313
And I want to make sure it stays that way.

1338
01:34:10.690 --> 01:34:13.533
Let me check you out. please.

1339
01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:18.083
- Sure.

1340
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:21.823
Next week. after work.

1341
01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:23.893
- Anytime.

1342
01:34:25.670 --> 01:34:26.503
Thank you.

1343
01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:29.693
I'm sorry.

1344
01:34:34.647 --> 01:34:35.880
I know it's scary

1345
01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:38.463
but you've got me now.

1346
01:34:46.638 --> 01:34:48.221
- You're too good.

1347
01:34:54.804 --> 01:34:57.721
Go. you've got other lives to save.

1348
01:34:58.560 --> 01:34:59.503
You can't be late.

1349
01:35:03.019 --> 01:35:04.069
I'm gonna go wash up.

1350
01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.310
- See you tomorrow?

1351
01:35:08.168 --> 01:35:09.251
- I think so.

1352
01:35:10.315 --> 01:35:11.815
I'll let you know.

1353
01:37:00.776 --> 01:37:02.550
- Patricia. can you take
a look at this for me?

1354
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:04.100
- Yeah. what's up?

1355
01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:05.730
You need me to read those to you?

1356
01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:07.353
- Check out these lab results.

1357
01:37:15.538 --> 01:37:17.371
- These can't be real.

1358
01:37:19.150 --> 01:37:20.817
Someone messed up.

1359
01:38:59.350 --> 01:39:00.750
Hi. can I help you?

1360
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:03.120
We're
looking for a Nico Dee.

1361
01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:07.210
Yes. she actually
works with me over at the bar.

1362
01:39:07.210 --> 01:39:08.740
She just got on shift.

1363
01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:09.823
Oh. great.

1364
01:39:09.823 --> 01:39:10.656
I'll just show you over here.

1365
01:39:10.656 --> 01:39:11.489
- Hey.

1366
01:39:11.489 --> 01:39:12.820
- What's going on. are you okay?

1367
01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:14.280
- Nico Dee?

1368
01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.113
Yes.

1369
01:39:15.113 --> 01:39:16.503
- Mind if we ask you a few questions?

1370
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:30.213
Is Nico Dee your full name?

1371
01:39:30.213 --> 01:39:31.046
Yes.

1372
01:39:31.046 --> 01:39:32.530
D-E-E?

1373
01:39:32.530 --> 01:39:33.363
Yes.

1374
01:39:33.363 --> 01:39:34.196
- Thanks.

1375
01:39:35.850 --> 01:39:38.170
I'm investigating the string
of murders around town.

1376
01:39:38.170 --> 01:39:40.190
And one of the victims was reportedly.

1377
01:39:40.190 --> 01:39:41.543
last seen with you.

1378
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:45.343
Do you know him?

1379
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:49.050
- Yes.

1380
01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:50.820
He was a customer.

1381
01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:52.310
- We were told you went up to his room.

1382
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:53.543
the night of his murder.

1383
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:56.170
- He's dead?

1384
01:39:56.170 --> 01:39:57.520
- Yes.

1385
01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.700
We found the body this morning.

1386
01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:00.050
in the desert outside town.

1387
01:40:02.630 --> 01:40:03.760
- Oh my god.

1388
01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:07.530
- The last time you saw him.
was there anything suspicious?

1389
01:40:07.530 --> 01:40:08.803
Was anyone else present?

1390
01:40:10.258 --> 01:40:11.710
- No.

1391
01:40:11.710 --> 01:40:13.563
Just had a few drinks.

1392
01:40:15.630 --> 01:40:16.933
We had a little fling.

1393
01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.360
Well. he was asleep
when I left and he said.

1394
01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.910
he's flying out in the morning.

1395
01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:28.210
- Do you know this man?

1396
01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:38.210
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

1397
01:40:38.210 --> 01:40:39.673
- Yeah. I think. I think so.

1398
01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.330
It looks like my ex Joe.

1399
01:40:42.330 --> 01:40:44.343
- When's the last time you saw him?

1400
01:40:46.413 --> 01:40:50.340
- A few months ago. since I moved here.

1401
01:40:51.250 --> 01:40:53.380
A few nights ago. he showed up here drunk

1402
01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:56.270
and right outside we had a fight

1403
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:58.110
and I haven't seen him since.

1404
01:40:58.110 --> 01:40:59.530
- When was that?

1405
01:40:59.530 --> 01:41:00.430
- Four nights ago.

1406
01:41:01.330 --> 01:41:03.330
- Do you know where he might be staying?

1407
01:41:03.330 --> 01:41:05.120
- No. I'm sorry.

1408
01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:06.043
I thought he left.

1409
01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:08.943
I told him I didn't want him here.

1410
01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:12.360
I moved here to get away from him.

1411
01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:18.030
Do you think he did this?

1412
01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:19.280
- We know he did.

1413
01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:21.650
but we're still putting
everything together.

1414
01:41:21.650 --> 01:41:24.880
Any information you
can provide would help.

1415
01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:26.307
Associates. family.

1416
01:41:26.307 --> 01:41:29.253
You're the only person we
have that knows the suspect.

1417
01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.600
- Sure. if there's
anything I can do to help.

1418
01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:34.863
- Thank you. Miss. Dee.

1419
01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:39.193
How long have you known Joe?

1420
01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:44.193
- Too long?

1421
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:57.733
Viktoria. where are you?

1422
01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:02.630
Come down. please meet
me by the river trail.

1423
01:42:04.357 --> 01:42:05.190
Okay.

1424
01:42:54.565 --> 01:42:55.470
- Are you okay?

1425
01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:56.620
- Where's Jure?

1426
01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:57.840
- He's in my room. getting ready.

1427
01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.587
we're leaving in a little bit.

1428
01:43:00.482 --> 01:43:01.710
- The police just came to my work

1429
01:43:01.710 --> 01:43:03.780
and questioned me for an hour.

1430
01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:04.613
- Shit.

1431
01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.010
- They know it's him.

1432
01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:08.713
- We're leaving tonight.

1433
01:43:08.713 --> 01:43:10.230
He's coming to stay with Claudia and I.

1434
01:43:10.230 --> 01:43:12.040
he's gonna get cleaned up.

1435
01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:13.540
I just hope it's not too late.

1436
01:43:15.468 --> 01:43:17.537
- I just have to move again.

1437
01:43:17.537 --> 01:43:18.850
- Are you sure?

1438
01:43:18.850 --> 01:43:19.913
Maybe it'll die down.

1439
01:43:21.788 --> 01:43:23.588
- I started hunting again. Viktoria.

1440
01:43:27.130 --> 01:43:29.513
They think it's Jure.
but I'm on their radar.

1441
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:33.220
How many times does he have to kill me?

1442
01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:35.760
Every time I think I have a life.

1443
01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.233
he rips it away from me.

1444
01:43:40.837 --> 01:43:42.113
Is it how it is for us?

1445
01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:46.780
We can only live by destroying
other lives around us?

1446
01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:49.280
- It is. for some.

1447
01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:51.320
But you are different.

1448
01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.240
Give it time. you'll find a balance.

1449
01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:55.490
- I just wanna be normal.

1450
01:43:56.710 --> 01:43:57.750
I was once.

1451
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:59.113
I just want what I had.

1452
01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:01.133
- You will find it.

1453
01:44:02.130 --> 01:44:03.970
There are others out there like us

1454
01:44:03.970 --> 01:44:05.570
and we're not all like Jure.

1455
01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:07.910
- We're all bastards. Viktoria.

1456
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:09.570
- We can get that way.

1457
01:44:09.570 --> 01:44:10.403
It's true.

1458
01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:14.260
What about this date you had?

1459
01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:16.527
Sounds like it didn't go well. either.

1460
01:44:16.527 --> 01:44:18.370
- It went great.

1461
01:44:18.370 --> 01:44:19.320
That's the problem.

1462
01:44:20.610 --> 01:44:23.220
He's a genuinely good person.

1463
01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:24.950
He's everything Jure isn't.

1464
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:27.580
- So. enjoy it.

1465
01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:28.623
- She's a doctor.

1466
01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:31.770
- Would you consider turning him?

1467
01:44:31.770 --> 01:44:32.603
- No.

1468
01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.210
No way in hell.

1469
01:44:35.210 --> 01:44:36.373
Especially not him.

1470
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:38.500
The man saves lives.

1471
01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:39.520
What would he think of me?

1472
01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:41.600
I've killed three since I met him.

1473
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.433
- You?

1474
01:44:42.433 --> 01:44:43.266
- On a day.

1475
01:44:44.490 --> 01:44:47.110
- He really lit your fire. didn't he?

1476
01:44:49.733 --> 01:44:51.410
- I'll be in touch.

1477
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:54.477
Thank you.

1478
01:44:54.477 --> 01:44:57.163
- You will find the
life you are hoping for.

1479
01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:01.587
Until then. go find some rich
bastard and suck him dry.

1480
01:45:03.164 --> 01:45:05.331
- I might have to do that.

1481
01:45:56.143 --> 01:45:56.976
- Jure?

1482
01:46:02.322 --> 01:46:03.155
Jure?

1483
01:46:17.091 --> 01:46:18.341
Son of a bitch.

1484
01:46:38.143 --> 01:46:39.950
- What did I say. good shit. right?

1485
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:41.143
- Um. yeah.

1486
01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:44.940
- Yes. it comes from the old country.

1487
01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:46.253
178 proof.

1488
01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:48.773
Kills all the pain.

1489
01:46:50.850 --> 01:46:54.821
Hey. you don't think I'm
an asshole too. do you?

1490
01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:57.130
Of course you don't.

1491
01:46:57.130 --> 01:46:58.523
You get it. man.

1492
01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:04.050
It's just ain't the place for
guys like us anymore. I guess.

1493
01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:04.883
- Yeah.

1494
01:47:04.883 --> 01:47:06.710
- Oh. man. look at us.

1495
01:47:06.710 --> 01:47:09.023
We created this. this whole world.

1496
01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:12.910
Now where it's just hiding from it.

1497
01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:14.320
Fuck that shit. man. right.

1498
01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:15.860
- You betcha.

1499
01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:16.763
- Fuck that. man.

1500
01:47:20.630 --> 01:47:21.697
You know what?

1501
01:47:23.922 --> 01:47:25.339
It is what it is.

1502
01:47:26.230 --> 01:47:27.730
What you gonna do?

1503
01:48:09.292 --> 01:48:10.300
- What are you doing here?

1504
01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:11.480
- You weren't at work or at home.

1505
01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:14.060
figured you'd come for
your car sooner or later.

1506
01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:15.638
- Are you stalking me now?

1507
01:48:15.638 --> 01:48:18.030
- Nico. I ran some tests.

1508
01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:18.863
- Tests on what?

1509
01:48:20.290 --> 01:48:21.450
- You've got numerous blood types--

1510
01:48:21.450 --> 01:48:22.283
- Raymond don't please--

1511
01:48:22.283 --> 01:48:24.040
- Your skin cells appear to
be hundreds of years old.

1512
01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:25.101
- Damn it. Raymond. Why?--

1513
01:48:25.101 --> 01:48:26.610
- Everything's been spinning
around in my head all day.

1514
01:48:26.610 --> 01:48:27.443
You don't eat.

1515
01:48:27.443 --> 01:48:28.340
You've lived everywhere.

1516
01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:29.790
How long have you been alive?

1517
01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:41.953
- Don't you know it's rude
to ask a woman her age?

1518
01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:46.393
- You're a miracle. Nico.

1519
01:48:50.284 --> 01:48:51.117
- I'm a curse.

1520
01:48:52.410 --> 01:48:54.090
- There are families in there.

1521
01:48:54.090 --> 01:48:56.283
who would pray for what you have.

1522
01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.593
- I'm a curse of death.

1523
01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.163
That's all I am.

1524
01:49:07.930 --> 01:49:09.280
And I won't do that to you.

1525
01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:12.503
- Nico. please?

1526
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:21.347
- If you were anyone else. I
would've killed you already.

1527
01:49:37.546 --> 01:49:41.722
Jure no!

1528
01:49:42.775 --> 01:49:43.608
No!

1529
01:49:43.608 --> 01:49:44.441
- A doctor?

1530
01:49:44.441 --> 01:49:45.274
Seriously?

1531
01:49:45.274 --> 01:49:47.386
It's a little boring. don't you think?

1532
01:49:47.386 --> 01:49:49.590
- You piece of shit!

1533
01:49:49.590 --> 01:49:52.283
- Hey. let him turn or kill him?

1534
01:49:53.130 --> 01:49:54.650
It's your choice.

1535
01:49:54.650 --> 01:49:55.653
- I should kill you.

1536
01:49:57.630 --> 01:49:58.463
- Well...

1537
01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:03.673
- Why. Jure. why do you do this to me?

1538
01:50:04.730 --> 01:50:06.590
- 'Cause you weren't going to.

1539
01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:11.560
Listen. I understand.

1540
01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.490
You are not like I am.

1541
01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:14.883
But I'm not all bad.

1542
01:50:17.090 --> 01:50:18.873
I know I can't fix things.

1543
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:22.670
I just hope one day you'd...

1544
01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:26.510
I just hope you can forgive me.

1545
01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:30.603
Hey. he's hurting pretty bad.

1546
01:50:31.530 --> 01:50:33.080
There's a hospital right there.

1547
01:50:35.370 --> 01:50:36.570
Don't worry. buddy.

1548
01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:38.933
It's just a little prick. all
right. you're gonna be fine.

1549
01:50:38.933 --> 01:50:40.770
It's gonna be a shitty couple of weeks.

1550
01:50:40.770 --> 01:50:42.980
but it'll be good to go.

1551
01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:44.540
Whole new man.

1552
01:50:47.404 --> 01:50:48.237
- Come on.

1553
01:50:48.237 --> 01:50:49.516
Almost there.

1554
01:50:49.516 --> 01:50:51.740
- Hey and you don't worry. I'm
just gonna clean up the rest

1555
01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:55.343
of my mess here and then I'm
gonna get out of your hair.

1556
01:51:00.604 --> 01:51:01.506
- It's gonna be fine.

1557
01:51:03.210 --> 01:51:04.700
Let me see.

1558
01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:05.617
Let me see.

1559
01:51:07.209 --> 01:51:08.669
He was right.

1560
01:51:08.669 --> 01:51:10.169
It's not that bad.

1561
01:51:21.246 --> 01:51:22.809
God damn it.

1562
01:51:22.809 --> 01:51:24.402
You taste delicious.

1563
01:55:17.756 --> 01:55:22.756
when it got this bad

1564
01:55:23.021 --> 01:55:28.021
a long black night

1565
01:55:41.865 --> 01:55:45.116
city gonna make them see

1566
01:55:56.412 --> 01:56:01.412
the words roll out

1567
01:56:12.988 --> 01:56:17.988
with heart of truth

1568
01:56:31.106 --> 01:56:34.146
the city gonna make them see
