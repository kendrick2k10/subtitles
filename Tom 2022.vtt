go ahead and justify

142

Granted. I'm a little biased.

definitely a demon host.

looked into the face of evil

151
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:31.430

they just ruined them.

152

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.063
I deal in science.

181
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:05.980
not wild tales about some hill person

182
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.803
with excessive conjunctivitis.

183
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.450
- [Man] Women are just seeing
evil and it's just completely

184
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.520
shattering them.

185
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.240
And it just takes time for them to rebuild

186
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.680
and get some semblance of normal.

187
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.670
Although they'll never be the same again.

188
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.720
- [Man] People have been thinking
that this might be related

189
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.500
to a potential chemical spill

190
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.150
at the garbage chemical company.

191
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.940
That I can't prove.

192
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.250
These are just things
that have been brought

193
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.493
to my attention.

194
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.090
- [Man] Why do they project
in a Latin language?

195
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.680
Why would they do that?

196
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.280
- [Man] Well. for several reasons.

197
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:52.260
One. Latin is used by quite a
lot of the infernal hierarchy.

198
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:56.160
And two it has historically
been used by the church

199
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.153
to ward against it.

200
00:15:59.733 --> 00:16:02.750
- I am a psychiatrist
at the top of my field.

201
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.810
I will help these people.

202
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:05.860
I am Dr. J. Bashiri.

203
00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:13.110
- [Man] If you're looking at
evil and evil is a real force.

204
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.580
I mean. people don't
like to talk about it.

205
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.900
but evil is an actual thing in this world.

206
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.330
And you know. the best
trick the devil ever played

207
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.708
was getting everybody to
believe that he doesn't exist.

208
00:16:25.758 --> 00:16:28.341
(upbeat music)

209
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.560
- What's up party people.
it's your boy. G-string.

210
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:32.890
Welcome back to the channel.

211
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.730
We're here doing another
Tommy Mavis challenge.

212
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.770
Now. did you hear the one where

213
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.690
Tommy Mavis tried to high-five the tree?

214
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.283
He was left hanging.

215
00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.650
Now we're here doing the Tommy Mavis.

216
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.500
coming out of the closet challenge.

217
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.450
Now I see these on YouTube.

218
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.523
Everybody's crying.
they're with their families

219
00:16:49.573 --> 00:16:51.580
just kind of somber. but guess what?

220
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.010
We're gonna put a little G-string twist

221
00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:54.850
on the challenge here.

222
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.700
So come on. let's do this challenge.

223
00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.130
All right. let's do this.

224
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.640
Tommy. Tommy. Tommy. who has no mommy.

225
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:02.523
are you in here?

226
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.463
Tommy?

227
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.920
Babe. I don't think this is working.

228
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.240
In the coming out of the closet videos.

229
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.510
They always say you're not alone.

230
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.160
But I think. babe. I gotta
be alone for this one.

231
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.480
We can't fit in this closet.

232
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:19.750
We can't fill this closet together.

233
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.960
So. can you make me some
dyno nuggies. please?

234
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.710
I'll take this from you.

235
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.870
All right.

236
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.410
All right. let's do this.

237
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.673
Tommy. Tommy has no.
mommy. are you in here?

238
00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.680
I think it's gotta be darker than this.

239
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:34.800
Make sure to smash that like button

240
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.850
if you want me to close the door here.

241
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.050
All right. let's do it.

242
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.303
Tommy. Tommy. Tommy. who has
no mommy. are you in here?

243
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.093
Tommy?

244
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.510
Smash that like button.

245
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.173
Tommy. Tommy. are you in here?

246
00:17:55.151 --> 00:17:57.313
Yo. it's the red eyes!

247
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.930
- You just got pranked.

248
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:07.280
- [G-string] Yo. it's just my roommate.

249
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.090
- It's your boy. Little Granny Panty

250
00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.340
back at it again with another prank.

251
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.440
Go subscribe to my channel.

252
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.900
Last week we got my
alcohol-addicted sister

253
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.020
back on the sauce.

254
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.493
She was six weeks sober.

255
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.930
- She's so much more fun
to hang out with now.

256
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.073
Those are some six shades. bro.

257
00:18:21.123 --> 00:18:21.906
Where'd you get them?

258
00:18:21.956 --> 00:18:23.090
- Yo. I bought them online.

259
00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.030
but they're from China.

260
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.950
So it took like three
fucking months to get here

261
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.113
and I had to denounce Taiwan.

262
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.223
- All right. that's it from us.

263
00:18:30.273 --> 00:18:31.960
That was about two minutes of content.

264
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.160
So enjoy the next eight
minutes of blank screen

265
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.060
so we can get our YouTube ad revenue.

266
00:18:38.272 --> 00:18:40.760
(upbeat music)

267
00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.393
- Holy shit. these guys are hilarious.

268
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.260
Why'd they ever stop making content?

269
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.913
- Because those guys are dead.

270
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.940
- Seriously?

271
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.980
- Supposedly the ride killed
them after they're doing some

272
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.610
Tommy Mavis challenge stuff in the woods.

273
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.840
I heard that the police found the footage

274
00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.210
then destroyed it because they
didn't want it getting out

275
00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.128
that there's a demon
beast running around town.

276
00:19:03.178 --> 00:19:05.110
- Ah. you know what?

277
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.840
I'm really jealous of you guys.

278
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.160
Whenever your murder rate goes up.

279
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.080
whenever something crazy happens.

280
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.240
you guys get a cool local
legend to go with it.

281
00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.397
- You don't have any murder
legends back in Chicago?

282
00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:19.837
- No. no. we just have legislation passed.

283
00:19:19.887 --> 00:19:21.660
(laughs)
- Well. what do you wanna do?

284
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.123
- Oh. where's that
forest that they were at?

285
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:26.930
- No. we can't go there.

286
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.650
That's a murder scene.

287
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.080
- All right. be a buzz kill.

288
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.930
- People get killed there.

289
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.763
- So?

290
00:19:32.813 --> 00:19:34.207
Okay.

291
00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:37.480
What about that place that
the PolterGuys went to?

292
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.163
That manor. mansion whatever.

293
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:41.793
- We could go there. I guess.

294
00:19:41.843 --> 00:19:43.543
I mean. no one was killed there.

295
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.250
- Yeah. no one was killed there.

296
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.410
So what's the worst that could happen?

297
00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.240
You know. if we're lucky that is the place

298
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.880
where the PolterGuys had sex

299
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.990
with that ghost girl in that tub.

300
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.430
- You realize that almost
everything on that show

301
00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.520
was staged. right?

302
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:00.353
- So?

303
00:20:00.403 --> 00:20:02.030
What if it isn't?

304
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.160
It'd be my lucky day.

305
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.370
- [Becca] All right. we can go.

306
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.090
Just promise me you won't do any of that.

307
00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.290
Tommy Mavis challenge stuff. okay?

308
00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.280
- Of course. of course.

309
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:16.156
I won't do any of that
Tommy Mavis challenge.

310
00:20:16.206 --> 00:20:18.660
- Okay. just don't do any of it. okay?

311
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:19.493
- Okay. yeah.

312
00:20:19.543 --> 00:20:20.663
I got you.

313
00:20:20.713 --> 00:20:22.660
Oh. do you know if uncle
Tom would have brought us

314
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.420
to do shit like this when we were kids.

315
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.070
I would have actually enjoyed
visiting Iowa with ya.

316
00:20:29.074 --> 00:20:31.657
(upbeat music)

317
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.203
Damn. this is cool as hell. Becca.

318
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.400
- Well. this is all you get to see of it.

319
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.850
It's not open to the public.

320
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.770
- Anything's open to the public

321
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.420
if you try hard enough.

322
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.250
- Charlie. think I wanna get arrested?

323
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.250
- You only get arrested if you get caught.

324
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.480
So let's head around back.

325
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.580
- We can walk around.

326
00:21:05.596 --> 00:21:07.653
- Whatever you say.

327
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:11.823
Yeah. I told you.

328
00:21:13.197 --> 00:21:14.890
- Don't see anyone around.

329
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.960
- No. one's gonna be able to
stop us from getting in then.

330
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.660
- I can't believe I've
never been here before.

331
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.273
- Oh. I can't wait.

332
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.981
- I don't know how we're gonna get in.

333
00:21:26.031 --> 00:21:27.773
- Well. there's a door.

334
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.663
- It's locked. now what?

335
00:21:33.462 --> 00:21:34.867
- Gimme a second.

336
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:42.560
- [Becca] Charlie.

337
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:43.443
- What?

338
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.893
The stairs are right here.

339
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.420
- I don't know if they're safe.

340
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:49.303
- Whoa. whoa.

341
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.523
- It's not funny.

342
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.123
- It's not that bad. Becca.

343
00:21:58.896 --> 00:21:59.729
- Charlie.

344
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.527
Did he get in?

345
00:22:07.754 --> 00:22:08.587
Charlie.

346
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:17.963
Charlie.

347
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.720
- Becca.

348
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:28.970
I found a door. come on.

349
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.103
Oh. quite the security
system they got here.

350
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.133
- God. we should not be in here.

351
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.460
- Come on. if they didn't
want us to be in here.

352
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.890
they totally would have made
it harder to break the locks.

353
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.970
- Let's just in and out.

354
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.300
Let's make it quick.

355
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.450
- Come on. this is cool.

356
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.130
Just look at this. When else
are you gonna be able to see

357
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.393
something like this?

358
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.370
So they really just closed down one day

359
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.290
and left everything like this?

360
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.280
- Well. they cut the funding
and just like that. closed.

361
00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:08.168
Everything is exactly the
same as the day it shut down.

362
00:23:08.218 --> 00:23:10.139
- That's so neat.

363
00:23:10.189 --> 00:23:13.310
Have you ever seen any of those
like Titanic documentaries

364
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.660
where. you know.

365
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.760
everything's the same exact
way that they left it?

366
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.330
I mean. it's all frozen in time.

367
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.850
Just. you know. exactly how
they left it when it sank.

368
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.460
- Just don't touch anything. all right?

369
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.040
Let's show a little respect.

370
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.773
In and out five minutes.

371
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.640
- You know. there are lots
of bedrooms around here.

372
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.430
Do you think that Tommy
guy ever lived here?

373
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.590
- Don't talk about him.

374
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.710
Don't say his name.

375
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.543
- What?

376
00:23:40.593 --> 00:23:41.657
Tommy Mavis.

377
00:23:41.707 --> 00:23:44.530
(loud roar)

378
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.450
Do we have bears in Iowa?

379
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.193
- There are no bears at Iowa.

380
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.300
- Tigers?

381
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.750
- No tigers either.

382
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.633
- Do pigs growl?

383
00:23:54.706 --> 00:23:56.643
- They squeal. they oink.

384
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.163
- You know what?

385
00:24:01.213 --> 00:24:01.996
You sit tight.

386
00:24:02.046 --> 00:24:03.390
I'll go check it out.

387
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.820
I'm sure it's nothing.

388
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.250
- I'm just gonna stay right here.

389
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.790
- [Charlie] I'll let you
know if I find anything.

390
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.780
- Just hurry up.

391
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.063
- It's okay.

392
00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.810
Holy shit.

393
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.253
It's the tub where he
fucked that ghost girl.

394
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.321
- Not into voyeurism?

395
00:24:26.371 --> 00:24:27.154
(laughs)

396
00:24:27.204 --> 00:24:28.680
That's fine. we can do whatever...

397
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.992
Yeah. yeah.

398
00:24:34.042 --> 00:24:37.228
No. no. no.

399
00:24:37.278 --> 00:24:38.916
Oh. don't stop.

400
00:24:38.966 --> 00:24:39.966
It's so bad.

401
00:24:41.494 --> 00:24:43.833
Look at me. I love it.

402
00:24:43.883 --> 00:24:44.951
It's Monday.

403
00:24:45.001 --> 00:24:46.402
Happy Tuesday.

404
00:24:46.452 --> 00:24:47.374
Happy day.

405
00:24:47.424 --> 00:24:48.841
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

406
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:53.503
- Okay. yep. I get it

407
00:24:53.553 --> 00:24:54.723
I'll go look.

408
00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.440
Teenage suicide.

409
00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:00.693
Don't do it.

410
00:25:03.785 --> 00:25:05.587
Oh. this isn't bad.

411
00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:10.933
Oh. because suicide is painless.

412
00:25:11.833 --> 00:25:15.913
it brings on many changes.

413
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.990
Oh. come on.

414
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.950
Hey. Tommy.

415
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.757
I heard you played high five with a tree

416
00:25:21.807 --> 00:25:23.463
and it left you hanging.

417
00:25:25.025 --> 00:25:28.775
(deep animalistic breathing)

418
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.170
Did you make the noise?

419
00:25:58.621 --> 00:25:59.871
Fucking Christ.

420
00:26:05.556 --> 00:26:07.063
Holy shit.

421
00:26:12.913 --> 00:26:13.746
- Charlie.

422
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:35.783
Charlie

423
00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.263
Hey. Charlie.

424
00:26:41.798 --> 00:26:44.298
(eerie music)

425
00:26:57.475 --> 00:26:58.308
Charlie.

426
00:27:05.919 --> 00:27:06.752
Charlie.

427
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.690
Charlie. it's been like 10 minutes.

428
00:27:21.558 --> 00:27:23.725
(screams)

429
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.523
Charlie. I'm leaving.

430
00:27:40.385 --> 00:27:41.813
Charlie.

431
00:27:43.387 --> 00:27:45.843
Fuck you. Charlie. I'm leaving.

432
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:48.780
- Oh. what?

433
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:49.750
Was that not funny?

434
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.470
Are you just gonna leave me for dead?

435
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.790
What. did you think I was
Tommy Mavers or something?

436
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.830
Tommy. Tommy has no mommy.

437
00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.410
(door slams)

438
00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.773
What the fuck?

439
00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:10.043
What the fuck?

440
00:28:10.093 --> 00:28:12.593
(eerie music)

441
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.063
Okay. okay.

442
00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.029
Becca. Becca. I think it's time to...

443
00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:35.560
I think it's time to go.

444
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.013
What the shit is that?

445
00:28:40.378 --> 00:28:41.860
What the fuck?

446
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:42.743
Oh my God.

447
00:28:44.408 --> 00:28:46.575
(screams)

448
00:28:54.022 --> 00:28:56.002
(screams)

449
00:28:56.052 --> 00:28:57.269
- Charlie.

450
00:28:57.319 --> 00:28:58.152
Charlie.

451
00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.837
I'm coming.

452
00:29:01.816 --> 00:29:04.316
(eerie music)

453
00:29:10.259 --> 00:29:12.842
(upbeat music)

454
00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:17.480
- In our next story.

455
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:21.240
the body of Charles McGuire
from Chicago. Illinois

456
00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:24.920
was found earlier this morning
at the Edinburgh Manor.

457
00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:27.810
the closed down abandoned county home.

458
00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.640
just outside Ludlow Falls.

459
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.810
The Ludlow Falls police
department has not released

460
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.410
any statements in regards
to the cause of death.

461
00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.160
If you have any information
in regards to the death

462
00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:41.650
of Charles Maguire.

463
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.150
please contact the Ludlow
Falls police department

464
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.883
at (319) 277-3962.

465
00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.830
- [Man] West of the
falls caller you're on.

466
00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.630
- [Caller] And now. now
we got some boy here.

467
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.450
dead from (bleep) Chicago.

468
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.690
I mean why the hell do
you even come out here?

469
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.150
Oh. you're gonna go legend tripping.

470
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.797
Oh. we're gonna go see some weird (bleep)

471
00:30:09.847 --> 00:30:12.070
out in the boondocks. ooh.

472
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.430
Well. I tell you what?

473
00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.350
You should've stayed in Chiraq brother.

474
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.770
'Cause you know yeah.

475
00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.560
the scariest thing you
might have out there

476
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:21.680
is some gang banger with a gun.

477
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.110
but out here we got
(bleep) demons. brother

478
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.590
and they ain't nothing to (bleep) with.

479
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.990
- The police have not been
honest nor transparent

480
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.223
during any of this.

481
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.413
We later proved that to be true.

482
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.990
Take for instance. those
two strange men in black.

483
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.300
nobody knows where they're from.

484
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.950
Nobody knows why they were here.

485
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.360
We never got an official report. why.

486
00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:54.180
Why were they here?

487
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:55.013
What was going on?

488
00:30:55.063 --> 00:30:56.610
They just swept that under the rug.

489
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.030
We have people with theories

490
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:05.280
saying that they were a
couple of religious henchmen

491
00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:08.860
or bounty hunters.

492
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.773
We never got an official story.

493
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.960
- Get a lot of these
dangerous. dangerous men.

494
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.880
You know. 90% of rapists are men.

495
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:19.980
82% of all murderers are men.

496
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.770
And so. I mean. just do the math.

497
00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.800
you kill the men. I think we only got

498
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.110
good people left on this planet here.

499
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.160
For some of you guys that are worried.

500
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:29.050
if you're not one of the bad men

501
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.100
that are out there raping and killing.

502
00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.083
you'll probably be fine from red.

503
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.840
- [Man] Weather sponsored
by Gurvich Chemical Company.

504
00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:41.350
Today's weather and Ludlow
Falls is a crisp 60 degrees

505
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.060
with low humidity.

506
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.700
Temps will remain in the
60s with scattered showers

507
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.040
on Friday.

508
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:52.067
- There was also those
two hypebeast influencers.

509
00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.233
their bodies found.

510
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.770
We understand that there
might be found footage.

511
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.230
Their cameras were still rolling.

512
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.080
That is what the reports are saying.

513
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.250
We know this because they
went live before that

514
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.000
stating that they were gonna go out there.

515
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.623
the north end of town.

516
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.430
If their cameras are rolling.

517
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.330
we should be able to see that footage.

518
00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.247
Give us the footage now.

519
00:32:23.297 --> 00:32:27.590
- Why would some Chicago kid
be here around Edinburgh Manor.

520
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.373
Like why would you be
slinking around there?

521
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.210
- No. not too sure.

522
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.453
what they call it. but something tripping.

523
00:32:38.757 --> 00:32:41.943
- Oh. he's probably doing
that legend tripping stuff.

524
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.153
Yeah. that makes sense.

525
00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:50.510
- [Man] East of the
falls caller. you're on.

526
00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.640
- [Caller] You know what?

527
00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:52.640
I like Red.

528
00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.300
He seems to kill all the bullies

529
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.340
and it makes all the mean
girls in town go crazy.

530
00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.070
- [Man] And it absolutely terrifies me

531
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.003
'cause we need more of
these white men dead.

532
00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.420
The oceans are absolutely just littered

533
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:05.720
with straws right now.

534
00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:08.790
- But you hear about like a
ghost story and something.

535
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.623
so you go there.

536
00:33:09.673 --> 00:33:11.967
So he's probably heard
about like Red and was like.

537
00:33:12.017 --> 00:33:15.190
"Oh. let's go mess with Red."

538
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.380
No. you stay away from that stuff.

539
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.140
Damn city people. they don't get it.

540
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:21.420
You stay away from that stuff.

541
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.300
You stay away from Edinburgh Manor.

542
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.850
stay away from Orange Junior High.

543
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.710
You stay away from those places.

544
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.640
you're gonna have a nice life.

545
00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:29.220
gonna die an old man.

546
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:30.053
And that's what you want.

547
00:33:30.103 --> 00:33:31.410
You don't wanna die young.

548
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.430
- No.

549
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.848
- [Man] East of the
falls caller. you're on.

550
00:33:35.898 --> 00:33:36.870
- [Caller] I just want everybody to look

551
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.190
at Gurvich Chemical Company

552
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.210
because I think they have
created some sort of gollum.

553
00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.030
which is their word. not mine.

554
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.040
which is kind of like a Jewish boogeyman.

555
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.960
- 109.

556
00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:51.300
Well. I mean it'd be 110
now with Afghanistan.

557
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:52.690
- What are we gonna do in their names?

558
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.353
What about Kenyon Jones?

559
00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.573
What about Tina Adams?

560
00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.173
What about Cindy Schlozman?

561
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:04.913
What even about John Baker?

562
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:08.083
Why have they not freed him?

563
00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.053
This whole world's going to hell.

564
00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.593
We're witnessing the
damnation of this nation.

565
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:27.350
- There is another missing
person reported in Ludlow Falls.

566
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.490
Becky McGuire of Ludlow
Falls was reported missing

567
00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.760
earlier this week.

568
00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.850
And authorities are asking
anyone that has any information

569
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.180
on Becky McGuire to please
contact the Ludlow Falls

570
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.543
police department at (319) 277-3962.

571
00:34:44.402 --> 00:34:47.235
(cathedral music)

572
00:34:58.908 --> 00:35:02.010
- No matter how low or how heartbroken

573
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.973
you can get in this world.

574
00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.957
remember that Jesus is always around you.

575
00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:15.293
- [Tommy] Can you go to
heaven if no one loves you?

576
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:21.640
- Tommy. Jesus will always love you

577
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.790
no matter what.

578
00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.490
As long as you have faith in Him.

579
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.120
He's willing to forgive you anything

580
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.573
as long as you put your
trust and faith in Him.

581
00:35:33.464 --> 00:35:36.480
- Can people be mean and
rude to you in heaven?

582
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.430
- No. nobody will be mean.

583
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.830
nobody will be hurtful
to you in heaven at all.

584
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:45.470
- People around here will.

585
00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.823
When they go to heaven. they will be mean.

586
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.510
- The Lord is close to the brokenhearted

587
00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:02.550
and saves those who are
crushed in spirit. Psalm 23:18.

588
00:36:05.887 --> 00:36:08.720
(cathedral music)

589
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.213
- Pastor. thank you for joining us today.

590
00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.530
This is Professor Qurell

591
00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.663
She is a top demonologist.

592
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.730
Our bishop trusts her

593
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.700
and our order considers
her knowledge and insight

594
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:37.330
in this matter with very high regard.

595
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.163
- Professor.

596
00:36:38.213 --> 00:36:39.730
- Minister.

597
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.120
Well. based on the report from Isaac.

598
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:43.350
we have a young man.

599
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:48.400
- Tommy Mavis is my greatest regret.

600
00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.720
He was neglected. mistreated and abused

601
00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.337
in this cruel corner of the world.

602
00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:03.917
And I failed him.

603
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.293
I failed the weakest member of my flock.

604
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.940
Deus mortem. that's will of death.

605
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.290
What is that?

606
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.650
- Well. basically. it's a
suicide pact that one would make

607
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:23.060
with a demon and it allows it
to become one with the host.

608
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.960
therefore giving it an immeasurable amount

609
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:29.033
of supernatural power
and physical strength.

610
00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:35.163
- I've been placed here by
my order to monitor this.

611
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.800
Two of our brothers. the two
men that you met. men of faith.

612
00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:47.800
two paladins sent by our
order to exorcize this demon

613
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:48.963
and save the boy.

614
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.390
They were brutally killed by it.

615
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:58.860
- So you think that Tommy
Mavis committed suicide

616
00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:03.910
in order to seal this pact
with the demon called Rumsah.

617
00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:09.890
- This host is far more powerful than any

618
00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.640
we've come in contact with before.

619
00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.343
The demon does come with an angel voice.

620
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.843
Sympathetic vision. soft voice.

621
00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:25.430
- You know. now that you mentioned it.

622
00:38:26.433 --> 00:38:29.980
I do remember a conversation
where he did talk about

623
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.343
being visited by an angel.

624
00:38:33.393 --> 00:38:35.893
(eerie music)

625
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.401
- [Tommy] Who are you?

626
00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:48.020
- I'm a friend.

627
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.730
Do you need a friend. Tommy?

628
00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.530
- [Tommy] I don't have any friends.

629
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:54.120
- I will be your friend. Tommy.

630
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.180
- [Tommy] Are you an angel?

631
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:58.330
- [Girl] I used to be.

632
00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.590
- [Tommy] Your eyes are red.

633
00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.530
- So are yours.

634
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.063
Have you been crying. Tommy?

635
00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:06.853
- [Tommy] Yes.

636
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.950
- People can be mean. very. very mean.

637
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.033
Can't they. Tommy?

638
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.440
- [Woman] You're no good. Tommy Mavis.

639
00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:19.810
Your parents didn't even want you.

640
00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.840
You come from a low class of awful people.

641
00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:25.660
You are the worst duck. Tommy.

642
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.900
You're lucky that a good
Christian woman like me

643
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.773
even tolerates you.

644
00:39:34.224 --> 00:39:35.372
- [Kid] You are ugly.

645
00:39:35.422 --> 00:39:37.220
You smell.

646
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.053
Freak.

647
00:39:38.103 --> 00:39:40.623
No one wants you here.

648
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:44.041
Go off to the woods and die.

649
00:39:44.091 --> 00:39:46.961
- [Woman] What are you gonna
do without your parents?

650
00:39:47.011 --> 00:39:49.210
- [Kid] No one likes you Tommy Mavis.

651
00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.960
no one wants you here.

652
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:53.580
- [Girl] Tommy. Tommy has no mommy.

653
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.530
- [Kid] No one likes you. Tommy Mavis.

654
00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.080
- Again.

655
00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.480
That's the wrong answer.

656
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.600
I don't have all day.

657
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:07.100
It's seven. one two three
four five six seven.

658
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:07.983
Not that hard.

659
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.323
- Why is everyone so cruel. Tommy?

660
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.680
No one should be allowed to be cruel

661
00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:23.307
to a good little boy like you.

662
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:27.910
- Look at you. you're so dirty.

663
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.430
You're gross.

664
00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.080
- I could never be cruel to you.

665
00:40:32.473 --> 00:40:34.143
I love you.

666
00:40:35.561 --> 00:40:38.017
And I will always be here for you.

667
00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.443
One day when you're old enough.

668
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.150
I can show you a way to be so strong

669
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.673
that you can punish all these people.

670
00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.920
I'll be waiting for you on the other side.

671
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:54.420
let's punish them all. Tommy.

672
00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:00.680
- [Minister] Give us this day.

673
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.750
our daily bread and lead
us not into temptation.

674
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.130
but deliver us from evil
for thine is the kingdom

675
00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.023
and the power and the glory forever. amen.

676
00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.313
- A demon comes with a whisper.

677
00:41:24.407 --> 00:41:29.407
We have a bullied. abused.
neglected boy in foster care.

678
00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:33.900
Our order has monitored this entity

679
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.393
in this area for centuries now.

680
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.760
- For. I am convinced that
neither life nor death.

681
00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:47.780
nor angels. nor demons. not
the present. not the future.

682
00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.760
nor height. nor depth.

683
00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:52.900
nor any power on this earth can overcome

684
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:56.180
the supreme power of
love that God shows us

685
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:59.790
through his son. our savior.
Jesus Christ our lord.

686
00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.100
- Now with local news.

687
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:03.190
volunteers are welcomed
to join the search party

688
00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.283
for Becky McGuire.

689
00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:05.530
a Ludlow falls native.

690
00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.660
who was reported missing
earlier this week.

691
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:09.450
Those wishing to participate in the effort

692
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.390
are encouraged to sign up at the Northwest

693
00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.310
fire department on Present Drive.

694
00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.950
- They're never short on volunteers.

695
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:16.900
- I wonder why that is.

696
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:19.260
I mean. it's always
people willing to help.

697
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:22.680
- Well. I mean. look at the
last couple that they found.

698
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:26.703
I mean always. you know.
young women. nubile.

699
00:42:27.933 --> 00:42:28.843
scantily clad.

700
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:32.393
(upbeat music)

701
00:43:51.158 --> 00:43:53.310
- Yeah. they are always running
around in their underwear.

702
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.170
- Yeah. yeah.

703
00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:59.590
You gotta be a real piece
of shit to sign up for that

704
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.090
if that's all you wanna see.

705
00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.230
- It seems like it's just
taking advantage of them.

706
00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.063
- Right?

707
00:44:04.113 --> 00:44:08.070
I mean. there's a poor woman
in a deranged mental state

708
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.960
and she doesn't know what
the hell is going on.

709
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:12.600
She's barely got any clothes on.

710
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.150
I mean. it feels real...

711
00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.713
It feels dirty. you know?

712
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:17.583
- Yeah. sure it does.

713
00:44:17.633 --> 00:44:19.863
- I mean. I signed up obviously.

714
00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:21.840
- When did they tell you to be there?

715
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:23.430
They told me to be there at two o'clock

716
00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.263
the day after tomorrow.

717
00:44:24.313 --> 00:44:25.820
- Yeah. they told me that too.

718
00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:27.237
I mean. I just wanna help though.

719
00:44:27.287 --> 00:44:28.070
- Yeah.

720
00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.849
- I mean. obviously it's just to help.

721
00:44:29.899 --> 00:44:30.682
Obviously.

722
00:44:30.732 --> 00:44:32.810
- Is Red sexist?

723
00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.440
You know. in some ways I would
have to say absolutely not.

724
00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:38.430
He is targeting males. being a male.

725
00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.870
But in another way. is he taking jobs away

726
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.930
from some of the female
serial killers out there

727
00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.900
by targeting some of these men?

728
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:47.340
Would Jodie Eris have the
spotlight that she has.

729
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:50.060
had Red come in and taken
out from underneath her?

730
00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:51.080
I don't know.

731
00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:53.850
It's not my place to say.

732
00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:54.683
I would just like...

733
00:44:54.733 --> 00:44:56.170
I think he's got a good place.

734
00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.220
You know. he's coming from a good place.

735
00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.280
When he kills these men.

736
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.000
I don't think he's thinking.

737
00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:04.830
"Oh. no woman could do this."

738
00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.607
I think he's thinking like. you know.

739
00:45:07.657 --> 00:45:08.440
"Leave her alone.

740
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:10.949
"She said. check your privilege."

741
00:45:10.999 --> 00:45:14.500
That's what he's doing is
basically checking their privilege

742
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:15.535
for them.

743
00:45:15.585 --> 00:45:18.585
(suspenseful music)

744
00:46:56.148 --> 00:46:59.065
(foreign language)

745
00:47:03.319 --> 00:47:04.721
(eerie music)

746
00:47:04.771 --> 00:47:07.604
(voices chanting)

747
00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.270
- Becky McGuire. the
missing Ludlow Falls woman

748
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.020
has been found and is alive.

749
00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:50.770
Members of a search party
located McGuire this afternoon

750
00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:55.820
on the rural gravel road. D13.
just north of Ludlow Falls.

751
00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:00.460
Police have reported that
she is in stable condition

752
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:02.070
and receiving medical treatment

753
00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:05.403
at St. Gerard Alamo
hospital in Ludlow Falls.

754
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:12.880
- St. Dymphna mental
institution in Ludlow falls

755
00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:15.110
will be closing its doors permanently

756
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.910
after the state has cut mental
health funding. yet again.

757
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.390
All current patients that
were receiving treatment

758
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.270
at St. Dymphna will be
transferred immediately

759
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.570
to the state mental
facility in Reliance. Iowa.

760
00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.700
We reached out to fame psychiatrist.

761
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:33.423
Dr. J. Bashiri. in regards to
the closure of St. Dymphna.

762
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:39.040
- The budgetary concerns

763
00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:42.560
at St. Dymphna mental health institution

764
00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:46.973
are no longer of my concern
because we have been closed.

765
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.170
I've been talking about the
lack of funding for years.

766
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.630
Nobody cared to listen

767
00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.403
while I was continuing to work and help.

768
00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:59.103
It's fine.

769
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.340
I understand that these
women that I've been treating

770
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:06.810
have been moved to the state facility

771
00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.623
under the supervision of one Dr. Block.

772
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.233
Yeah. we were at undergraduate together.

773
00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:19.653
It's safe to assume he
still has a ponytail.

774
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:24.460
He's a very nice man. but let's
just. you know. to be Frank.

775
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:26.710
I can neither trust or respect a man

776
00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.353
who got a C in anthropology.

777
00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:33.393
- Because of the fact that
St. Dymphna hospital closed.

778
00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.330
they quit paying orderlies.

779
00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.970
They quit paying all the staff.

780
00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:41.120
everybody down to the janitors. everybody.

781
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:44.460
When that happened.

782
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:49.300
that made their NDAs.
non-disclosure agreements.

783
00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:50.263
null and void.

784
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:54.130
If you're not getting
paid. why keep the secret?

785
00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:56.240
- I wish we could divert
some of the funding

786
00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:58.730
from some of these sports

787
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.460
that everyone seems to
be so enthralled with

788
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:03.900
and puts them back into the wellbeing

789
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:07.440
and mental health of
our young men and women.

790
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:09.190
- [Man] State representative Dickingham.

791
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.680
I have to ask a actual
question that the community

792
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:15.180
wanted me to follow up on.

793
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:19.070
Now. you have voted for
a new football stadium

794
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.840
and to increase the pay of the head coach.

795
00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:25.730
How can you justify
that allotment of money

796
00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.680
in the state's budget
when you're shutting down

797
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:31.880
mental health facilities in this area?

798
00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.190
- [Dickingham] Well. can these crazies

799
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.120
learn to block or tackle
or run a ball or--

800
00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:39.810
- I've been a bit at a loss of what to do

801
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:43.860
now that I can no longer
use my exemplary talents

802
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:44.920
to help people.

803
00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:47.610
just what I've been trying
to do this whole time.

804
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.340
So I'm trying to focus inward.

805
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:52.513
What does Dr. J. Bashiri love?

806
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:56.580
Entomology.

807
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:59.533
Which is the study of
insects. for the layman.

808
00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.623
And of course my biggest passion.

809
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:08.590
the restoration of
Victorian-era Wicker furniture.

810
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:15.780
I will focus on these hobbies of mine

811
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:17.610
and hope that these women receive

812
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.780
the help that they deserve.

813
00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:23.692
that I. unfortunately. can
no longer provide them.

814
00:51:23.742 --> 00:51:26.242
(eerie music)

815
00:51:43.644 --> 00:51:46.561
(foreign language)

816
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.263
- Any additional physical restraints?

817
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.490
- Restraints seem to distress her.

818
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:22.283
I think the room will be adequate.

819
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.393
- Yeah. I concur.

820
00:52:47.583 --> 00:52:50.416
(classical music)

821
00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.668
- If the government lied
to us about one thing.

822
00:52:55.718 --> 00:52:57.950
why wouldn't they lie to
us about the next thing

823
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.090
and the next thing and the
next thing. and the next.

824
00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:04.790
Tech offensive. Tuskegee
syphilis experiment.

825
00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:08.390
Building seven or nine 11
was not hit by a plane.

826
00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:11.002
And why no video of a
plane hitting the Pentagon?

827
00:53:11.052 --> 00:53:13.250
Maybe the earth is flat.

828
00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.203
Who can trust anything you've
been told at this point.

829
00:53:19.994 --> 00:53:22.827
(classical music)

830
00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:30.250
- Have you ever noticed that
every girl named Michele

831
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.760
is crazy?

832
00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:33.573
Think really hard about it.

833
00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:37.820
Do you honestly know a single sane one?

834
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:39.390
I guess it's really just my parents' fault

835
00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.860
since they named me Michele.

836
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:43.830
or whoever convinced
them to name me Michele.

837
00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.930
I wonder who convinced
them to name me Michele.

838
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:50.870
- You need to check and
recheck things again and again.

839
00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.230
I don't see what is wrong with that.

840
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.020
What if you were wrong
and the stove was on

841
00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:59.140
and people died because
you didn't check it.

842
00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:01.240
I just think it is being careful.

843
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:04.620
And there's nothing wrong with
just being an extra attentive

844
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:07.493
and careful. nothing
wrong with that at all.

845
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.630
- Yeah. I messed up my hand.

846
00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:14.160
but if I were named Kyle
and had a lifted truck.

847
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:15.932
he wouldn't even bat an eye.

848
00:54:15.982 --> 00:54:18.332
But oh no. we can't have
an angry little woman.

849
00:54:24.741 --> 00:54:25.524
- [Dr. Karen] Cameras.

850
00:54:25.574 --> 00:54:26.600
- I found them.

851
00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:30.073
- [Dr. Karen] You found
them. did you keep them?

852
00:54:31.492 --> 00:54:33.122
- I flushed them.

853
00:54:33.172 --> 00:54:36.157
- [Dr. Karen] Oh. you flushed them.

854
00:54:36.207 --> 00:54:39.263
Can you describe what they looked like?

855
00:54:40.463 --> 00:54:42.990
- [Gabby] You already
know what they look like.

856
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.603
- Gabby. I don't believe
you found any cameras.

857
00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.473
There are no cameras. Gabby.

858
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:54.400
- There are cameras. literally everywhere.

859
00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:58.360
- [Dr. Karen] Gabby. we've
been through this before.

860
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:00.890
You claim you find cameras.

861
00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.180
yet you never show them to us.

862
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:04.730
- Why would I show them to you?

863
00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.740
You're just gonna take them back.

864
00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:09.829
- Why would we have cameras. Gabby?

865
00:55:09.879 --> 00:55:11.050
- Why wouldn't you have cameras?

866
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:13.130
You gotta keep track
of where everyone's at

867
00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:13.963
all fucking the time.

868
00:55:14.013 --> 00:55:16.900
- [Dr. Karen] But you know
where security cameras are.

869
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:19.200
They are not hidden.

870
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:22.450
- [Gabby] Yeah. that's
kind of an obvious thing.

871
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.403
Don't you think?

872
00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:29.440
- I think you wanna keep us drugged up.

873
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.910
- [Dr. Karen] Do you feel drugged up?

874
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.540
- I think you should lower my dose.

875
00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:39.673
It's been 64 days since
I've had a dose change.

876
00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:43.290
- I feel that your dosage is appropriate.

877
00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:44.600
In those 64 days.

878
00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:46.550
your mood has been more stable.

879
00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.260
you've had less bouts of paranoia.

880
00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:51.003
I feel the medication is working.

881
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:53.950
- Why?

882
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.383
- [Dr. Karen] Michele. you're
not hearing the voices.

883
00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.653
Or if you are. you're not telling us.

884
00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:06.700
Michele. do you miss the voices?

885
00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.593
- [Michele] No.

886
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.121
- Denise. tell me about your morning.

887
00:56:14.171 --> 00:56:16.080
- My morning wasn't too bad.

888
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.083
I didn't really have a lot of
freakouts compared to normal.

889
00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.560
Everything. almost
everything was in order.

890
00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:26.450
There wasn't anything
wrong with the breakfast.

891
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.220
There was the perfect amount
of butter on the toast.

892
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:30.920
It was honestly a lot better than--

893
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:34.886
- She took long in the
line again (indistinct)

894
00:56:34.936 --> 00:56:36.407
- Hold on.

895
00:56:36.457 --> 00:56:39.080
- I'm so thankful. you're
giving me the opportunity

896
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:40.290
to share.

897
00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:42.180
- [Dr. Block] You're welcome.

898
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:44.750
- She's taking long in the line again.

899
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.070
She's lying to both of you.

900
00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.460
She's counting everything.

901
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:51.570
The amount of stroke
she does with the knife

902
00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:52.500
with the butter.

903
00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:55.080
the amount of time she puts
the butter on the toast.

904
00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:57.820
Just grab the shit and go to your spot.

905
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:59.910
It's not that hard.

906
00:57:01.123 --> 00:57:03.870
- [Dr. Block] Calm down.

907
00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.220
- Well. if I ate at the time

908
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:10.370
I'd like to eat instead of
waiting behind certain people.

909
00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:13.600
maybe I wouldn't be as elevated.

910
00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:15.490
- [Man] Stanley you gotta
try this metaverse thing out.

911
00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:18.320
You can make Tilda Swinton's
hair whatever color you want.

912
00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:21.193
- Wait. oh boy. we're on.

913
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:24.560
- Yes. we're on.

914
00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:28.370
And as you saw last time
on our social media pages.

915
00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:31.930
we are once again. live to
bring in the poll results

916
00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.950
of where you want us to go next

917
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.600
in this haunted world
that we call the world.

918
00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:39.950
- That's right?

919
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.770
We tasked you. our fans. to
decide where we're gonna go

920
00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:49.303
next on a very special
episode of The PolterGuys.

921
00:57:51.197 --> 00:57:54.093
- Is it going to be the bears. Chicago?

922
00:57:55.557 --> 00:57:57.513
Is it going to be
(foreign language) Paris?

923
00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.993
- [Stan] Or would it be Cabo?

924
00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:06.590
- Let's find out.

925
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.820
- [Stan] George. do the honors.

926
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:11.040
- We are going to be
bringing the results in.

927
00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:12.670
We have not seen these yet.

928
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.950
We want you to experience along with us.

929
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.870
you loyal. loyal. loyal.
loyal. PolterGuys viewers.

930
00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:23.250
What we experience when we
see things for the first--

931
00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.133
- [Stan] George.

932
00:58:27.919 --> 00:58:28.880
- Here they come.

933
00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:30.917
Chicago. Paris.

934
00:58:30.967 --> 00:58:32.737
And with a beautiful 5% .

935
00:58:32.787 --> 00:58:34.787
it looks like we're going to Cabo. mate.

936
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:37.799
- [Stan] Ludlow Falls.

937
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:38.632
- [George] What?

938
00:58:38.682 --> 00:58:40.016
Why would we go to Ludlow Falls?

939
00:58:40.066 --> 00:58:41.899
- [Stan] Ludlow Falls.

940
00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:43.790
- It's right behind me.

941
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:44.623
Isn't it?

942
00:58:44.673 --> 00:58:46.193
Ludlow Falls is right behind me.

943
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:48.350
- [Stan] I don't wanna go.

944
00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:51.740
It was the writing.

945
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:53.714
I told you. we shouldn't have a write in.

946
00:58:53.764 --> 00:58:55.501
- You're the one who put the write in.

947
00:58:55.551 --> 00:58:56.334
- [Stan] I know.

948
00:58:56.384 --> 00:58:57.167
- From the TikTok video.

949
00:58:57.217 --> 00:58:58.000
Remember?

950
00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:00.850
- I know I was trying to make
it seem like it was your fault

951
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.027
but it's mine.

952
00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:06.250
- I wanted to go to Ludlow falls.

953
00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.300
We've heard terrible
things happen there. mate.

954
00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:10.370
- [Stan] I already know that. George.

955
00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:11.960
- I've got an idea.

956
00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:13.200
- [Stan] What?

957
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:14.930
- We cut this. we edit it.

958
00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.400
- We can't cut it.

959
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:17.710
We're live streaming right now.

960
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.260
to all of our wonderful fans.

961
00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:20.093
- Oh. what's up.

962
00:59:20.143 --> 00:59:22.492
Peace and love (indistinct)

963
00:59:22.542 --> 00:59:23.860
Look. here's what we're gonna do.

964
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:26.440
We're gonna go to Ludlow
Falls because the Polter fans

965
00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:30.210
want us to go there and we
are gonna freak out beans

966
00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:33.340
and get so nasty with all
the nasty ghosts there.

967
00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:36.255
You're gonna see more stuff
than you've ever seen in your...

968
00:59:36.305 --> 00:59:38.664
(crying)

969
00:59:38.714 --> 00:59:41.430
- Thank you so much to our
loving and adoring fans

970
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.550
that care only about our wellbeing

971
00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.133
and not for what's best for the TV show.

972
00:59:51.644 --> 00:59:54.477
(cathedral music)

973
01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:28.233
- So baptism of the dead.
Is that what this is called?

974
01:00:28.283 --> 01:00:29.640
Baptism of the dead.

975
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:32.400
- I would consider it a proxy baptism

976
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:34.473
or a vicarious baptism.

977
01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:42.033
- I don't think my order would
condone Mormon practices.

978
01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:45.580
- Well. in the early 1900s.

979
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:49.110
there was a local holy
man who he came in contact

980
01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.290
with a demon. much like this.

981
01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:53.990
And he said that he was able
to significantly weaken it

982
01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.290
by blessing the snow

983
01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.040
when it would fight in the winter.

984
01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:03.280
- The bishop sent Isaac
and Gus to burn the tree

985
01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:05.103
where he committed suicide.

986
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:11.004
He sent them the bus
lands to try to weaken it.

987
01:01:11.054 --> 01:01:13.554
(eerie music)

988
01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:21.134
(growl)

989
01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:50.900
- And the devil who had
deceived them was thrown

990
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:53.030
into the lake of burning sulfur

991
01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:57.143
where the beast and the false
prophet had been thrown.

992
01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:03.260
They will be tormented day
and night. forever. and ever.

993
01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.623
- Revelation. 20:10.

994
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:19.990
- Only a Christian of pure faith and soul

995
01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:24.753
has a chance to exorcize
or baptize this thing.

996
01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.340
If you see it. run.

997
01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:36.267
(eerie music)

998
01:02:36.317 --> 01:02:40.200
- Let us pray in the manner
that Jesus taught us to pray.

999
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:44.103
Our father who at in heaven.

1000
01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:46.570
hallowed be thy name

1001
01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.610
thy kingdom come

1002
01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:51.050
thy will be done

1003
01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:54.130
on earth as it is in heaven

1004
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.840
give us this day. our daily bread.

1005
01:02:56.890 --> 01:02:59.090
and forgive us our sins

1006
01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:05.240
as we forgive those who
have sinned against us.

1007
01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:06.980
lead us not into temptation.

1008
01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:11.810
but deliver us from evil
for thine is the kingdom.

1009
01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:15.627
and the power and the glory forever. amen.

1010
01:03:30.016 --> 01:03:32.599
(upbeat music)

1011
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:47.392
- Welcome to The PolterGuys.

1012
01:03:47.442 --> 01:03:48.849
- Welcome to The PolterGuys.

1013
01:03:48.899 --> 01:03:49.732
- Stanley.

1014
01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.079
Welcome to The PolterGuys.

1015
01:03:52.129 --> 01:03:52.912
- Welcome to The PolterGuys.

1016
01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:54.920
- All right. put it back.

1017
01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:57.237
Welcome to The PolterGuys.

1018
01:03:57.287 --> 01:03:58.166
Are you gonna do it?

1019
01:03:58.216 --> 01:03:59.457
- [Stan] No. you said no.

1020
01:03:59.507 --> 01:04:01.469
- I like it. the fans like it.

1021
01:04:01.519 --> 01:04:03.559
It's a little bit of fun
that we love to have.

1022
01:04:03.609 --> 01:04:04.488
- Welcome to The PolterGuys.

1023
01:04:04.538 --> 01:04:05.321
- Stanley.

1024
01:04:05.371 --> 01:04:06.624
- [Stan] God damn it.

1025
01:04:06.674 --> 01:04:07.870
- Welcome to The PolterGuys.

1026
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.230
We are back for the final
time at Orange Junior High.

1027
01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:16.900
where we have encountered the
mysterious Red. many times.

1028
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:21.270
Now it was not our idea
to be here. but the fans'.

1029
01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.350
because of a certain online
poll that was posted.

1030
01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.183
- Right.

1031
01:04:25.233 --> 01:04:28.083
Someone in our camp. our team.
and shouts out to the camp.

1032
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.910
they put a poll up that said.
where did you like us to go?

1033
01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:34.240
And you all wrote it in Ludlow
Falls because you're all

1034
01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:35.190
a bunch of (beep).

1035
01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.470
- Now we will be staying
here for one final night

1036
01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.340
to get the most compelling ghost activity

1037
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:47.500
captured on camera that we
have ever. ever. ever seen.

1038
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.680
And Stanley. I think
I speak for both of us

1039
01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:51.240
when I say (laughs)

1040
01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:54.000
I hope the activity
starts a little bit later

1041
01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:55.818
in the night and this time.

1042
01:04:55.868 --> 01:04:56.738
And not just--

1043
01:04:56.788 --> 01:04:58.608
Oh God. it's happening already.

1044
01:04:58.658 --> 01:04:59.441
Did you see that?

1045
01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:00.274
How ironic.

1046
01:05:00.324 --> 01:05:02.241
- [Stan] Run. run. run.

1047
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.640
- We are now on the third floor.

1048
01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:10.890
where will we be staying when
nothing is going to happen

1049
01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.715
until it gets a little bit darker out.

1050
01:05:12.765 --> 01:05:14.848
(laughs)

1051
01:05:15.996 --> 01:05:18.163
(screams)

1052
01:05:22.272 --> 01:05:25.383
Stanley. Stanley. Stanley. watch.

1053
01:05:27.582 --> 01:05:28.749
- [Stan] Cool.

1054
01:05:30.194 --> 01:05:31.111
Let me try.

1055
01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:49.960
- Finally. some peace and quiet.

1056
01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:51.070
In the maths room.

1057
01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:51.953
- [Stan] Yes.

1058
01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.913
Jesus Christ. it's Red.

1059
01:05:56.963 --> 01:05:59.430
- I don't know if you
can see this at home but.

1060
01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.140
it might be hard to make out but

1061
01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:04.820
you could probably see that
that's the (indistinct) Red.

1062
01:06:05.943 --> 01:06:07.143
- All right. you know what?

1063
01:06:07.193 --> 01:06:08.040
- What?

1064
01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:09.630
- We're gonna defeat evil.

1065
01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.980
Evil gets defeated tonight.

1066
01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:14.218
- Evil gets defeated tonight.

1067
01:06:14.268 --> 01:06:16.510
[Stan and George together]
Evil gets defeated tonight.

1068
01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.627
- Stanley. get out your bible.

1069
01:06:18.677 --> 01:06:19.460
- [Stan] Here.

1070
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:21.010
- Thank you.

1071
01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.706
Stanley. this is not a Bible.

1072
01:06:23.756 --> 01:06:25.440
- [Stan] It's my Bible.

1073
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:27.630
I read it religiously.

1074
01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.020
- You know. I do believe that.

1075
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:32.130
Anything can be anyone's religion.

1076
01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:32.963
Viewers out there.

1077
01:06:33.013 --> 01:06:35.020
your friends and family
might think you're strange

1078
01:06:35.070 --> 01:06:36.886
for believing in some type of--

1079
01:06:36.936 --> 01:06:38.855
(screams)

1080
01:06:38.905 --> 01:06:40.400
I thought he was here.

1081
01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:41.730
He's just so silent.

1082
01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:44.900
I know. he's a fan.

1083
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:46.100
- In his cosplay.

1084
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:48.050
You like cosplay. yes.

1085
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:50.030
- Here sweetheart. give him a shirt.

1086
01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:54.070
- Hey. thank you for being
one of our biggest fans.

1087
01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:57.023
- [Stan] And a big fan
needs a small shirt.

1088
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:58.860
That'll never work.

1089
01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:01.073
Try that.

1090
01:07:01.123 --> 01:07:02.120
- What's this?

1091
01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:04.033
- [Stan] Three XL.

1092
01:07:04.083 --> 01:07:05.480
- Okay well. here you go.

1093
01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:07.410
It's always nice to meet a fan.

1094
01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:09.463
Oh look at that

1095
01:07:09.513 --> 01:07:10.933
- [Stan] You look great in that.

1096
01:07:12.048 --> 01:07:13.490
- [George] He loves it.

1097
01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.590
- [Stan] We love you.

1098
01:07:16.338 --> 01:07:18.029
- We love you so much. Hey. quit it.

1099
01:07:18.079 --> 01:07:19.912
- Hey. he's not a fan.

1100
01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:25.680
Hey. wait a minute (indistinct)

1101
01:07:29.113 --> 01:07:30.620
(screams)

1102
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:35.670
- Cosmetics. pharmaceuticals.
household polymers.

1103
01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:42.180
Gervich Chemical is a world
leader in the material sciences.

1104
01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:47.350
We bring decades of
experience to the forefront

1105
01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.669
to make the world of tomorrow. today.

1106
01:07:50.719 --> 01:07:52.150
And why do we do that?

1107
01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:56.983
Because we're Gervich
Chemical Company and we care.

1108
01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.060
(eerie music)

1109
01:08:05.009 --> 01:08:05.842
- Stanley.

1110
01:08:07.691 --> 01:08:09.720
- Oh God. no.

1111
01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:10.760
- George.

1112
01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:12.370
- Stanley.

1113
01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.990
as I live and breathe
you've saved me life.

1114
01:08:16.837 --> 01:08:18.990
- And I know you'd do
the same for me. George.

1115
01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.113
- Oh. Stanley.

1116
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:22.733
- George?

1117
01:08:22.783 --> 01:08:23.616
- I think about it.

1118
01:08:24.730 --> 01:08:25.980
- You're my best friend.

1119
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:27.403
- Yes. yes you are.

1120
01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:31.053
Hey Red. eat this you slimy bastard.

1121
01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:35.027
We can't die we're "The Polterguys".

1122
01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.347
Let's never come back here.

1123
01:08:39.397 --> 01:08:40.950
And I mean it this time.

1124
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.410
- We're never setting foot
in Ludlow Falls again.

1125
01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.570
- I keep saying it for ratings.

1126
01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:46.680
but I don't wanna come back.

1127
01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:48.497
- We're not doing it. mate.

1128
01:08:48.547 --> 01:08:49.390
We're not doing it.

1129
01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.223
- No. we're not doing it no more.

1130
01:08:50.273 --> 01:08:52.000
- I can't feel my ass.

1131
01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:53.313
- My legs are broken.

1132
01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.593
Well. shall we?

1133
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:05.040
- Edinburgh Manor. Orange Junior High.

1134
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:06.390
and the north end of town.

1135
01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.560
If you are in those areas. get out.

1136
01:09:11.610 --> 01:09:14.763
Nothing good has happened
there in the recent years.

1137
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:19.670
Some of the most violent crime I've seen

1138
01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.790
in any of these pictures.

1139
01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.820
Any of these stories
being reported back to us

1140
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:27.270
of what happened. have been
some of the most frightening

1141
01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:30.493
and disgusting things
I've ever seen or heard.

1142
01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.360
- [Man] East of the
falls caller you're on.

1143
01:09:37.410 --> 01:09:39.200
- [Caller] People. you need to stay away.

1144
01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:40.740
Stay away from this place.

1145
01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:43.810
Stay away from the old
Orange Junior High School.

1146
01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:44.643
It's Red.

1147
01:09:44.693 --> 01:09:45.650
It's Tommy Mavis.

1148
01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:47.431
They call him Red.

1149
01:09:47.481 --> 01:09:48.264
If you look at him.

1150
01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:49.420
the guy will just smash your head.

1151
01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:51.520
And everybody just stay away.

1152
01:09:51.570 --> 01:09:54.720
I mean. you're messing with trouble. okay?

1153
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:56.593
It's a bad deal. I'm telling you.

1154
01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:00.520
- [Reporter] Today's weather
will be a comfortable

1155
01:10:00.570 --> 01:10:03.350
50 degrees with temps
staying in the 50s all week.

1156
01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.500
Local weather provided by
Gervich Chemical Company.

1157
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:08.890
- If the police really
wanted to do anything

1158
01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:12.080
to help that community they'd
call the national guard

1159
01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:13.860
and they would wait post at every single

1160
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.980
one of those spots and
ensure the people's safety.

1161
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:19.170
And I know what you're thinking.

1162
01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.930
You're thinking I'm calling in martial law

1163
01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:22.180
like I'm some sort of trader.

1164
01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:24.803
No. this is a real big deal.

1165
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:31.323
They should slash and burn
that whole north end of town.

1166
01:10:32.370 --> 01:10:33.463
Clear it all out.

1167
01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.267
All even-steven. get rid of that.

1168
01:10:36.317 --> 01:10:39.220
And I know I'm gonna catch shit

1169
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:41.170
from little environmentalist hacks.

1170
01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.003
They're gonna say.

1171
01:10:42.053 --> 01:10:43.850
"Oh. he's talking about
the decimation of area."

1172
01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:44.700
It does not matter.

1173
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:45.743
People are dying.

1174
01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:50.600
Get over your tofu-flavored bullshit.

1175
01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:53.790
- So it was written by
this egg head out at MIT.

1176
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.590
It's called "The Industrial
Society and the Future."

1177
01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.423
Great read.

1178
01:10:58.473 --> 01:10:59.970
You need to definitely read it.

1179
01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:00.929
- Oh read in hell.

1180
01:11:00.979 --> 01:11:03.257
I should be writing my own manifesto.

1181
01:11:03.307 --> 01:11:05.250
"How to stay alive in Ludlow Falls."

1182
01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:06.770
- Oh. hell yeah.

1183
01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.140
Hell yeah.

1184
01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:10.630
You could distribute it and
people could actually not die.

1185
01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:11.470
That'd be great.

1186
01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:12.303
- Yeah.

1187
01:11:12.353 --> 01:11:14.077
Or better yet. how a book.

1188
01:11:14.127 --> 01:11:17.310
"How not to PISS off
Tommy Mavis for dummies."

1189
01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.207
- Oh yeah.

1190
01:11:18.257 --> 01:11:21.150
You know. they just gotta leave him alone.

1191
01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.704
It's like...

1192
01:11:22.754 --> 01:11:26.550
Okay. let's say there's a
tiger and it's over there.

1193
01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.730
And we're over here.

1194
01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.417
These people are like. "Oh.
let's go fuck with the tiger.

1195
01:11:30.467 --> 01:11:32.360
"Let's go poke his balls."

1196
01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:33.540
No. you don't do that.

1197
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:35.210
You leave the fucking tiger alone.

1198
01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:36.430
- No. there's no ball poking.

1199
01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.010
- No. there ain't no ball poking.

1200
01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:38.843
- No.

1201
01:11:38.893 --> 01:11:40.980
- [Preacher] Come back to God.

1202
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:42.963
Come back to the scripture.

1203
01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:48.823
I beg you come home to Jesus Christ.

1204
01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:53.833
I leave you with Psalm 34:21.

1205
01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.113
Evil will slay the wicked.

1206
01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:02.140
The foes of the righteous
will be condemned.

1207
01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:03.840
- Love kills the demon.

1208
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:06.410
We should love one another. you know.

1209
01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.303
- Well. you know. I love you.

1210
01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:14.797
- Oh.

1211
01:12:14.847 --> 01:12:15.890
- No. no. no.

1212
01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:17.390
Not like that.

1213
01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.590
No. no. no.

1214
01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.423
Not like that.

1215
01:12:19.473 --> 01:12:21.238
Not like in a cowboys
in a tent sort of way.

1216
01:12:21.288 --> 01:12:23.600
Like platonically.

1217
01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:24.433
- Platonic.

1218
01:12:24.483 --> 01:12:26.860
- Yeah. not like in an
ideal form sort of way.

1219
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:29.320
but like friendship.

1220
01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:31.380
like a brother sort of thing. you know?

1221
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:33.025
- That would take care of the demon.

1222
01:12:33.075 --> 01:12:34.020
- It would.

1223
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:35.340
- Drive out the demons.

1224
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:36.917
freely you have received

1225
01:12:36.967 --> 01:12:39.980
freely give that is from Matthew 10:8.

1226
01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:42.150
Tom Mavis is not dead.

1227
01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.257
He is going to punish you all.

1228
01:12:44.307 --> 01:12:46.786
All you self righteous people.

1229
01:12:46.836 --> 01:12:49.569
you are all Christian hypocrites.

1230
01:12:49.619 --> 01:12:52.650
You are all Christian hypocrites.

1231
01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:56.527
Read the book of John verse 19 and 20.

1232
01:12:56.577 --> 01:12:58.257
"Whoever claims to love a god

1233
01:12:58.307 --> 01:13:02.200
"yet hates a brother is a liar."

1234
01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:05.190
Ludlow Falls is a sinful place.

1235
01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:07.520
The fear of the Lord prolongs life

1236
01:13:07.570 --> 01:13:10.883
but the years of the
wicked will be shortened.

1237
01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:14.610
I saw into his eyes.

1238
01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.420
I saw hell.

1239
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:18.450
Hell is coming for you.

1240
01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:23.500
Tom Mavis will bring it right
to your precious Ludlow Falls.

1241
01:13:23.576 --> 01:13:25.763
Evil shall slay the wicked.

1242
01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:32.220
- Ms. Anderson is in her
padded cell reciting sermons

1243
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:37.010
on fire and damnation
from morning until night.

1244
01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.110
What do you wanna do?

1245
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:42.250
- When she gets to
Revelations. we'll up her dose.

1246
01:13:43.575 --> 01:13:46.408
(classical music)

1247
01:14:06.421 --> 01:14:07.830
- It just really fucking pissed me off

1248
01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.090
that they turn off the "Golden Girls".

1249
01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.440
They know the TV is
supposed to stay on late.

1250
01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:13.833
especially on Thursdays.

1251
01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:18.803
- Thank you for sharing
that with the group. Jill.

1252
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:26.080
- Becky. today the day
you'd finally like to start

1253
01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:27.133
to share with us?

1254
01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.270
- Vengeance is mine.

1255
01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.503
I shall repay.

1256
01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.523
Vengeance is mine.

1257
01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.233
I shall repay.

1258
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:49.660
That's the translation
of what I was saying

1259
01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:50.953
when they found me.

1260
01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:57.240
(foreign language)

1261
01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.773
It's Romans 12:19.

1262
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:11.410
It also was written in
Tommy Mavis' suicide note.

1263
01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:18.003
The demon is called Raumsa.

1264
01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:25.883
I'm lucky.

1265
01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.873
It's easy to have faith
when you've seen it.

1266
01:15:33.557 --> 01:15:36.343
Well then it isn't really
faith at all. is it?

1267
01:15:37.810 --> 01:15:39.093
It's knowledge.

1268
01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:44.826
I don't wanna go back.

1269
01:15:44.876 --> 01:15:46.513
I don't wanna go back.

1270
01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:52.390
When you look into his eyes.
you only see one thing.

1271
01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:55.815
Hell.

1272
01:15:55.865 --> 01:15:57.698
I don't wanna go back.

1273
01:16:04.124 --> 01:16:06.957
(classical music)

1274
01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:18.588
(bell ringing)

1275
01:16:23.046 --> 01:16:25.546
(eerie music)

1276
01:17:14.943 --> 01:17:17.526
(upbeat music)

1277
01:18:25.222 --> 01:18:26.055
- Raumsa.

1278
01:18:30.161 --> 01:18:34.328
Oh Lord. how often have
we prophesied in thy name?

1279
01:18:36.419 --> 01:18:39.405
In your name. cast out demons.

1280
01:18:39.455 --> 01:18:41.872
In your name done great work.

1281
01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:46.804
Tommy.

1282
01:18:49.646 --> 01:18:50.646
Tommy Mavis.

1283
01:18:53.607 --> 01:18:56.010
If you forgive others their transgressions

1284
01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:58.537
the Lord will also forgive you.

1285
01:19:02.232 --> 01:19:03.815
Tommy. let this go.

1286
01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:05.907
Forgive.

1287
01:19:07.097 --> 01:19:09.373
There's no need to punish anyone.

1288
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:12.310
There's no need for revenge.

1289
01:19:13.614 --> 01:19:16.614
(upbeat rock music)

1290
01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:59.780
- In our next story. a gruesome
scene out of Ludlow Falls.

1291
01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:02.560
- Earlier this morning.
the remains of several men

1292
01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:05.810
were found in a wooded
area near Insanus Ravine

1293
01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:08.550
just off of the north
edge of Ludlow Falls.

1294
01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:12.460
- Authorities have not released
any official information

1295
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:14.870
in regards to the identity of the man

1296
01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.660
in this apparent mass homicide.

1297
01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:19.370
- But eyewitnesses have detailed

1298
01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:22.620
a very disturbing recount of the findings.

1299
01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:25.490
- Agents from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation

1300
01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:28.330
have arrived in Ludlow Falls today

1301
01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:31.550
and the governor has ordered
national guard troops

1302
01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:32.623
to the area.

1303
01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:43.213
- Remember your creator
in the days of your youth.

1304
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:46.223
before the days of trouble come.

1305
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:49.980
That the years approach and you will say.

1306
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:51.483
I find no pleasure in them.

1307
01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.263
Ecclesiastes 12:1.

1308
01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:59.913
"be aware and vigilant. we are but sheep.

1309
01:21:01.477 --> 01:21:03.049
"and evil has arrived."

1310
01:21:03.099 --> 01:21:06.099
(upbeat rock music)
