(suspenseful music)

32
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.203

I think you upset my friends a little bit.

So listen. this is how it works.

46
00:02:42.807 --> 00:02:44.860
You throw the game for us tomorrow.

47
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.570
you get to keep your arm.

48
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.330
What arm does he throw it
again. I don't remember.

49
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.308
- I think it's the right.

50
00:02:49.308 --> 00:02:50.141
- The right.

51
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:51.313
Make a mental note. this is the right one.

52
00:02:51.313 --> 00:02:52.146
- Okay.

53
00:02:52.146 --> 00:02:53.337
- Okay?

54
00:02:53.337 --> 00:02:54.943
You don't throw the game.

55
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.710
my friend Lou here is
going to cut your arm.

56
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.030
And then you get to what's it called.

57
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.210
you get to apply for early retirement.

58
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.700
You know. it doesn't matter
to me what you want to do.

59
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.990
It's totally up to you. you tell us.

60
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.083
- You can forget it. man.

61
00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:10.885
(spitting)

62
00:03:10.885 --> 00:03:13.112
- [Lou] Man. you know
let me cut his arm off.

63
00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:15.300
- No! No! No! No! No!

64
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.490
Oh. Jesus Christ. sorry.

65
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.323
- So what?

66
00:03:19.772 --> 00:03:21.422
You got to keep doing business with us.

67
00:03:21.422 --> 00:03:23.280
- Okay. okay. I'll throw the game.

68
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.876
I'll throw the game.

69
00:03:24.876 --> 00:03:26.690
(panting)

70
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.353
- All right. Get him up.

71
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.273
- Come up. bitch.

72
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.746
- Come here.

73
00:03:38.746 --> 00:03:40.547
(shakes off dust)

74
00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:42.087
You see. good as new.

75
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.770
You see Corey. when you
stick to the arrangement.

76
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.770
we prosper. you prosper.
everybody prospers. huh?

77
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.920
When you don't stick to the arrangement.

78
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.393
then nobody prospers.

79
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.720
And when nobody prospers.

80
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.870
what's that mean Bobby?

81
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.550
It means that we're
going to have a problem.

82
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.914
I don't like to have a problem.

83
00:04:09.914 --> 00:04:10.840
Do you get me?

84
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.780

an Arab Sheikh.

551
00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.540
- No. I brought my car.

552
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.730
Thank you though.

553
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:48.581
- Yeah?

554
00:19:48.581 --> 00:19:49.417
- Yeah.

555
00:19:49.417 --> 00:19:50.250
- All right.

556
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.009
Well. how about I walk you to the door?

557
00:19:52.009 --> 00:19:52.842
- Okay.

558
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.127
- Go home safe tonight. all right?

559
00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:55.960
- I will.

560
00:19:57.772 --> 00:19:59.343
- I'm tired. it was a long day.

561
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.143
A long day and a lot of booze.

562
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.200
- Well you're supposed to.

563
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.780
- That's your fault. you
made those drinks too strong.

564
00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.340
- That means I did a good job.

565
00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.413
- Yeah. Yeah.

566
00:20:16.304 --> 00:20:17.804
- Thank you. Nick.

567
00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.893
- Yeah. no problem.

568
00:20:23.874 --> 00:20:24.957
- Good night.

569
00:20:26.173 --> 00:20:28.783
- Good night. Erica.

570
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.736
Merci.

571
00:20:31.736 --> 00:20:32.569
- Merci.

572
00:20:40.054 --> 00:20:42.721
(door creaking)

573
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.490
(light music)

574
00:20:54.702 --> 00:20:57.369
(intense music)

575
00:21:01.753 --> 00:21:04.920
(speaking in Italian)

576
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.823
- We meet again.

577
00:21:09.823 --> 00:21:11.160
- How you doing. Erica?

578
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.990
- I'm good. just had a nap.

579
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.570
Grinding away.

580
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.878
- Yeah. tell me about it.

581
00:21:16.878 --> 00:21:18.461
I know the feeling.

582
00:21:19.803 --> 00:21:20.636
- Espresso.

583
00:21:20.636 --> 00:21:22.230
- Yeah. please. Thanks.

584
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.410
Hey. have the guys been here yet?

585
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.410
- No. not yet.

586
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.010
No one's been in. It's too early.

587
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:32.030
- Thanks again for working
my birthday party last night.

588
00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.980
- Of course. I can always
use the extra money.

589
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.440
- Did you have a good time?

590
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.410
- I was working but
everything was really nice.

591
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:41.970
especially your food.

592
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.770
- You didn't get to eat nothing?

593
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.597
- No. I was working.

594
00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:46.960
- Oh. I feel bad now.

595
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.010
Like I want to go to your house

596
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.823
and make you a home cooked
pasta meal or something.

597
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.180
- Are you a good cook?

598
00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.013
- Of course.

599
00:21:54.013 --> 00:21:54.871
I'm Italian.

600
00:21:54.871 --> 00:21:56.421
It's like kind of in the blood.

601
00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.470
- I've never been to Italy. Nick

602
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.301
- You've never been to Italy.

603
00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:02.134
- Mm-hm.

604
00:22:02.134 --> 00:22:02.967
- What the hell do you mean?

605
00:22:02.967 --> 00:22:03.900
I mean. what do you do your whole life?

606
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.903
You like only work. that's it?

607
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.043
- Yeah. pretty much.

608
00:22:08.043 --> 00:22:10.100
I got rent. bills.

609
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.710
- Student loan. bills. right?

610
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.543
Yeah. yeah. I got all of that.

611
00:22:12.543 --> 00:22:14.180
I mean. I never went to school personally.

612
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.310
but I mean still got to have a
little fun in life. you know?

613
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:18.710
Live your life a little bit.

614
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:20.603
- How about this?

615
00:22:20.603 --> 00:22:24.913
I promise by the time I'm 40.
I would have visited Italy.

616
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:26.703
- Yeah?

617
00:22:26.703 --> 00:22:27.536
- Yeah.

618
00:22:27.536 --> 00:22:28.369
- All right.

619
00:22:28.369 --> 00:22:30.160
I mean. you know if you need me

620
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.320
to take you there personally. I can.

621
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.160
No problem.

622
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.490
I mean. no problem.

623
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:35.323
- You serious?

624
00:22:35.323 --> 00:22:36.156
- Yeah.

625
00:22:36.156 --> 00:22:38.730
I can be very spontaneous
when I want to be.

626
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.000
- I'm going to hold you to that.

627
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.107
- Yeah. you better.

628
00:22:42.107 --> 00:22:43.260
- All right.

629
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.860
- Let me try your coffee. all right.

630
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.693
Let's see.

631
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.070
It's good. it's very good.

632
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.000
- Yeah? Thank you.

633
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.430
- It's better than Fabrizio's.

634
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:54.263
He's old now.

635
00:22:54.263 --> 00:22:56.368
He doesn't make it as.
you know what I mean?

636
00:22:56.368 --> 00:22:58.990
- It's still a huge
compliment coming from you.

637
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:01.673
- Anytime. From now on
you make my espresso.

638
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.380
Hey Erica. can you do me a favor?

639
00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.390
Can you run the back room
for a few minutes. please?

640
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.790
- Yeah. of course now.

641
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.623
- Thanks honey.

642
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:17.423
- Nick. it was about
last night. the dispatch.

643
00:23:18.654 --> 00:23:21.170
I'm sorry. I know things got out of hand

644
00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.513
and I talked to Bobby.

645
00:23:23.513 --> 00:23:26.263
(dramatic music)

646
00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:28.483
I'm sorry.

647
00:23:31.225 --> 00:23:32.624
(glass shattering)

648
00:23:32.624 --> 00:23:33.633
(punch thudding)

649
00:23:33.633 --> 00:23:34.919
(man grunting)

650
00:23:34.919 --> 00:23:36.669
- Gone mother fucker!

651
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.509
- [Bobby] Nicky enough. Nicky enough.

652
00:23:40.509 --> 00:23:43.298
- All right. I'm good. I'm good.

653
00:23:43.298 --> 00:23:44.673
Hey. look at me.

654
00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:48.308
Hey. I ever see you again. I'll kill you.

655
00:23:48.308 --> 00:23:49.518
You understand?

656
00:23:49.518 --> 00:23:51.010
I'll kill you!

657
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:51.843
Fabrizio!

658
00:23:51.843 --> 00:23:54.748
(speaking in Italian)

659
00:23:54.748 --> 00:23:55.581
I'll kill you.

660
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:56.830
Hey. we got to go see Anthony.

661
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:57.663
Come on. come on.

662
00:23:57.663 --> 00:23:58.496
I'll kill you. you hear me?

663
00:23:58.496 --> 00:24:00.007
And his whole family.

664
00:24:00.007 --> 00:24:01.174
I'll kill you!

665
00:24:02.596 --> 00:24:06.513
(Fabrizio speaking in Italian)

666
00:24:09.598 --> 00:24:12.598
(suspenseful music)

667
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:19.570
- So you knocked him out?

668
00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.440
- Yeah. I had to.

669
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.230
You saw it was in my party yesterday.

670
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.280
- Yeah. horrible.

671
00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.113
- Loose cannon.

672
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.490
- Good to get rid of him then.

673
00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.740
- Yeah. I don't want
that guy around no more.

674
00:24:33.157 --> 00:24:35.293
- Mayor Olson. this is Nick Romano.

675
00:24:37.121 --> 00:24:38.710
- Nice to see you.

676
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:39.543
- Romano.

677
00:24:39.543 --> 00:24:40.420
- Nice to meet you.

678
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.150
My lawyer. Anthony Rivera.

679
00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.180
- Mr. Mayor.

680
00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.530
- [Mayor] All right boys.

681
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.470
I think we're about ready to get going.

682
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:50.800
Now. my deputy mayor here
tells me that you want

683
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.580
to create a casino by the beach.

684
00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.413
- Yes. sir.

685
00:24:55.413 --> 00:24:57.210
The Romano corporation has selected

686
00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:58.900
a piece of land for the endeavor.

687
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.800
We fill out all the required applications

688
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.870
and are just waiting for you

689
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.640
to sign off on the building permits.

690
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.450
- I see.

691
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.290
- [Anthony] Your deputy mayor
mentioned that your office

692
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:14.530
is looking for ways to create
more jobs in the community.

693
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.720
Our research shows that a casino

694
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.113
will provide a 20% increase
in the Miami workforce.

695
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.403
- A workforce for who?

696
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.700
Hispanics parking cars?

697
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.140
Asians cooking?

698
00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.210
Haitians doing the Uber?

699
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:37.210
Oh. and let's not forget the
Italians running the casino.

700
00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:39.693
- Sir?

701
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.860
- You know. I would like to create jobs

702
00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.710
for the Miami workforce. for Americans.

703
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:53.400
I don't want a bunch of
illegals running around

704
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:58.400
stealing jobs from decent
red blooded American.

705
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.830
- With all due respect. Mr. Mayor.

706
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.730
our company providing equal opportunity

707
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.592
to the workforce with no discrimination.

708
00:26:06.592 --> 00:26:07.425
(chuckling)

709
00:26:07.425 --> 00:26:08.733
- Is that so?

710
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.810
- Mr. Mayor. how about you tell me

711
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.440
why you won't let me build my casino?

712
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:21.420
- Well. let's just say. that
the past history of your family

713
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.203
raises a few red flags.

714
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.530
- I own a restaurant. I
own a real estate company.

715
00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.030
I pay my taxes every
year like everybody else.

716
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.580
- I'm talking about your real business

717
00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.360
in connection to the mafia.

718
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.233
- The mafia?

719
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:41.613
I'm not in the mafia.

720
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.970
Look at my record. go ahead.

721
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.510
It's clean.

722
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.981
I never even been arrested before.

723
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:47.814
(chuckling)

724
00:26:47.814 --> 00:26:49.010
- Okay. Romano.

725
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:53.360
You want to play these
little games? We can.

726
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.400
- You know what's funny?

727
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.520
I mean. I'd like to think you being mayor.

728
00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.480
you'd be supportive of a
boost to the Miami workforce.

729
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.223
I mean. you're the mayor. right?

730
00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:06.623
- [Mayor] You better believe I am.

731
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.770
And it's a hell of an idea. boy.

732
00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:13.243
A hell of an idea.

733
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:17.863
I just want the right people running it.

734
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.570
American people.

735
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.823
You get me. Romano?

736
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:27.443
- I got you.

737
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.190
- I think we're about
done here. gentlemen.

738
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.563
I do thank you for stopping by.

739
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.040
I appreciate it.

740
00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.890
- Thank you for your time. Mr. Mayor.

741
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.143
- Romano.

742
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.733
one more thing.

743
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:52.860
Just remember that as
long as I'm the mayor.

744
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.290
there ain't no way you're going to build

745
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.740
a casino in my goddamn town.

746
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.550
(chuckling)

747
00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.233
It's not happening. boy.

748
00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.021
- You have a good day. Mr. Mayor.

749
00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:10.854
Come on.

750
00:28:14.756 --> 00:28:15.589
(door shutting)

751
00:28:15.589 --> 00:28:17.007
Come on.

752
00:28:17.007 --> 00:28:17.840
(door shutting)

753
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.590
We're going to go see
this Marcus Towns guy.

754
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.423
- Okay. I have to go back to my office.

755
00:28:20.423 --> 00:28:22.592
- All right. I'll see you later.

756
00:28:22.592 --> 00:28:23.530

- What's it?

784
00:29:15.414 --> 00:29:17.637
- Check it out. Nick Romano's here.

785
00:29:17.637 --> 00:29:18.939
He asked if he can talk to you.

786
00:29:18.939 --> 00:29:20.440
- Nick Romano is here?

787
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.440
You go bring him in.

788
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.567
If he down here might
be something important.

789
00:29:24.567 --> 00:29:26.030
(chuckling)

790
00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:26.863
Nick Romano!

791
00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.660
What's cracking bro?

792
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.493
- My man.

793
00:29:30.493 --> 00:29:31.326
- What's good.

794
00:29:31.326 --> 00:29:32.159
- This is my boy. Bobby.

795
00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:33.200
- Bobby. what's good.

796
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.893
Please fellows. you have
a seat. have a seat.

797
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.020
Ladies. you know who this dude is?

798
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:37.853
Whose family is?

799
00:29:37.853 --> 00:29:40.180
Like they like old school OG shit.

800
00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.380
I'm talking like...

801
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.213
- Okay.

802
00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:43.330
- Yeah. I don't know
about all that. Marcus.

803
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:44.272
- So what's up. man?

804
00:29:44.272 --> 00:29:45.105
What brings you down.

805
00:29:45.105 --> 00:29:46.340
slum down with the black folks?

806
00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.670
- No. no. no.

807
00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.520
I stopped by 'cause I need to
ask you for a little favor.

808
00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.720
- Me? For a favor?

809
00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.630
What can I do for you?

810
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:56.860
Let's see.

811
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.260
Coc?

812
00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.600
Weed?

813
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.433
Drugs?

814
00:30:00.433 --> 00:30:01.620
What do you need?

815
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.453
Some girls?

816
00:30:02.453 --> 00:30:04.180
- Nothing like that. Nothing like that.

817
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.283
You see Sonny Prima.

818
00:30:07.191 --> 00:30:09.093
He happens to be a good friend of mine.

819
00:30:10.132 --> 00:30:11.580
- Oh. Sonny Prima.

820
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.413
Okay.

821
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.860
- I was wondering if
maybe you wouldn't mind

822
00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.700
keeping him on your label?

823
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.658
As a personal favor to me?

824
00:30:19.658 --> 00:30:20.840
(Marcus grunting)

825
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.673
- Nick. Nick. man.

826
00:30:21.673 --> 00:30:23.850
You know. I can't do that.

827
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:24.810
- Why is that?

828
00:30:26.537 --> 00:30:28.910
- I mean Sonny's old. right?

829
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.963
Like old-old. like it doesn't.

830
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.760
Frank Sinatra done. Dean Martin shit

831
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.080
like this doesn't work nowadays. right?

832
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:38.940
Everything's like hip hop.

833
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.790
Everything's like trap. club shit.

834
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.530
He's just always he puts me to sleep.

835
00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.920
So I don't think he's going
to work anymore on the label.

836
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.960
- No. I get that Marcus.

837
00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.793
I respect that.

838
00:30:48.793 --> 00:30:51.690
But you know. Sonny in particular.
he still has a following.

839
00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:53.390
The old timers. they love him. right?

840
00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:54.697
They love him.

841
00:30:54.697 --> 00:30:55.597
- If I went to the grave.

842
00:30:55.597 --> 00:30:56.890
(laughing)

843
00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.320
Old timers. they're not streaming.

844
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.170
They're not buying nothing.

845
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:02.730
They're dying out. bro.

846
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:06.170
Dead. Frank Sinatra. Dean Martin shit.

847
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.570
that don't make me no money.

848
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.440
- Marcus. didn't your father and Sonny

849
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.690
have a deal for like
50 years or something.

850
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:17.730
- My father? My father.
if I remember correctly.

851
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.653
was getting robbed by your uncle.

852
00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.090
Under label expenses.

853
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:26.480
Studio time. cars.
watches. all those things

854
00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.960
and my father gave money
to him to help his career.

855
00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.213
Do we never got that?

856
00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.550
It sounds to me like you're trying to rob

857
00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:36.750
the same way he was robbing my father.

858
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.620
- Look. I'm not trying to disrespect you.

859
00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.720
- That's exactly what you're trying to do.

860
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.740
You must think I'm stupid. right?

861
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.573
Like. come on. man.

862
00:31:45.573 --> 00:31:46.980
I know who you are.

863
00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:47.813
You is a gangster.

864
00:31:47.813 --> 00:31:49.530
You is gangster. right?

865
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.620
That's all gangsters
understand is gangster shit.

866
00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.083
Only time you come down is
when you need something.

867
00:31:53.083 --> 00:31:54.760
When you want something from the black man

868
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.210
trying to do the right thing.

869
00:31:57.559 --> 00:31:58.413
I'm tired of it.

870
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:03.160
I'm not gonna let you rob
me like you robbed my pops.

871
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:03.993
You want to get some gangster shit?

872
00:32:03.993 --> 00:32:05.309
Think I'm scared of you.

873
00:32:05.309 --> 00:32:06.142
(gun cocking)

874
00:32:06.142 --> 00:32:06.975
You know what?

875
00:32:06.975 --> 00:32:08.703
The only thing you understand is this.

876
00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.600
I'm not stupid.

877
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.120
I'm not a fool.

878
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.680
I'm not letting you rob me

879
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.940
like you did my pops until his grave.

880
00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.423
You and that Goomba. walk out of my club

881
00:32:18.423 --> 00:32:20.103
outside where you roll in.

882
00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:23.689
Go!

883
00:32:23.689 --> 00:32:26.439
(dramatic music)

884
00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.500
Let me know if you're reconsidering.

885
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.100
- I'm not reconsidering shit.

886
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.350
Step!

887
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:35.550
- Time to go. gentlemen.

888
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.720
- I'm not a fool. Nick.

889
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.823
I know what you up to.

890
00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:49.283
- Yeah.

891
00:32:49.283 --> 00:32:50.520
Your asses just better keep moving.

892
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:54.640
- [Nick] Hey buddy.

893
00:32:56.044 --> 00:32:58.161
You want to back down?

894
00:32:58.161 --> 00:32:59.567
- And what if I don't?

895
00:32:59.567 --> 00:33:01.253
You're going to make me?

896
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:08.410
- I'm not going to tell
you again. back off.

897
00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:09.721
- Really?

898
00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:11.804
(arm swishing)

899
00:33:11.804 --> 00:33:13.520
(punch thudding)

900
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.959
- Oh that's good huh.

901
00:33:14.959 --> 00:33:15.792
That's good.

902
00:33:15.792 --> 00:33:18.247
(arm swishing)

903
00:33:18.247 --> 00:33:21.287
(punch thudding)

904
00:33:21.287 --> 00:33:23.870
(man grunting)

905
00:33:28.213 --> 00:33:29.573
- I asked you nicely.

906
00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:32.523
What?

907
00:33:33.436 --> 00:33:35.250
- You know I could handled that.

908
00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.083
- I had him.

909
00:33:36.083 --> 00:33:38.020
- You know you had him
just as like what I do.

910
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.870
- All right. sorry Bobby.

911
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:42.200
Next time. he's all yours.

912
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.033
- Thank you.

913
00:33:43.033 --> 00:33:44.130
That's all I asked for you.

914
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.080
That's two before lunch. you know that?

915
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.030
- You know you're becoming
very sensitive lately.

916
00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:49.889
you know that?

917
00:33:49.889 --> 00:33:50.722
- I'm not an over sensitive guy.

918
00:33:50.722 --> 00:33:52.380
- That's the new girlfriend of yours.

919
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.480
Now what. you want to marry this girl?

920
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.770
You want to have kids?

921
00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:57.973
Half the guys in the neighborhood
banged her last week.

922
00:33:57.973 --> 00:33:59.480
You want to marry this fucking girl?

923
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.313
- Yeah.

924
00:34:00.313 --> 00:34:01.630
(car engine revving)

925
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.270
- Listen. your dirty grease spa.

926
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:08.730
You better have my car
detail cleaned to perfection

927
00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.450
or I'll deport you and your entire family

928
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:13.907
faster than you can say. "Adios."

929
00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:17.360
It better be there.

930
00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.843
Damn it.

931
00:34:18.843 --> 00:34:20.966
(telephone banging)

932
00:34:20.966 --> 00:34:24.610
(telephone ringing)

933
00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.310
What the hell do you want now?

934
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.570
- You're the mayor. right?

935
00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:32.150
- Well that all depends who wants to know.

936
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:34.910
- Someone who has a common enemy with you.

937
00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:36.263
- You don't say.

938
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:40.570
Then just who is this common enemy?

939
00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:41.543
- Nick Romano.

940
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.880
Let's just say I want to maybe discuss

941
00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.048
taking care of him for you.

942
00:34:47.048 --> 00:34:51.310
- Oh. I'm all ears. boy.

943
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:56.310
Tell you what. you come
over to my office right now

944
00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:01.120
and we can have us a
little chat in person.

945
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.060
- All right.

946
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.416
Yeah. I'll be there in 30 minutes.

947
00:35:04.416 --> 00:35:06.266
- Good. I look forward to seeing you.

948
00:35:07.141 --> 00:35:09.891
(dramatic music)

949
00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:16.453
- Nick. I'm sorry man.

950
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.830
The guy's a racist piece of shit.

951
00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.120
- I thought you said this
guy wanted to open a casino.

952
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.947
- He wants to open a casino.

953
00:35:23.947 --> 00:35:24.787
But you heard him.

954
00:35:24.787 --> 00:35:26.890
"I want red blooded Americans to do that."

955
00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.070
He doesn't want people like us.

956
00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:30.630
- Nicky. why don't we just
get somebody to run it?

957
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.900
Pull the strings from the back.

958
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.700
- No. Bobby. I can't do that.

959
00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.180
I open my own casino in
Miami and with my name on it.

960
00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.010
No cover guys please. you know?

961
00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:40.060
- I understand. Yeah.

962
00:35:41.832 --> 00:35:44.415
- Diego. what's your boss into?

963
00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.171
This awesome guy?

964
00:35:47.171 --> 00:35:48.690
- It won't be hard to find.

965
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:52.693
He likes gambling. he
likes orgies with horse.

966
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.600
Basically anything that
keeps him away from home.

967
00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.060
You'll find him.

968
00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.200
- Stand up guy. huh?

969
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.490
- [Diego] He's a piece of shit.

970
00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:01.323
Oh that's...

971
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.400
Yeah. I mean if you're
being sarcastic. then yeah.

972
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.010
He's a real piece of shit.

973
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:08.910
Anyway guys. I got to go.

974
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:09.833
- [Nick] All right.

975
00:36:09.833 --> 00:36:10.844
- I got a meeting.

976
00:36:10.844 --> 00:36:12.120
- All right Diego. I'll call you tomorrow

977
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:12.953
we'll figure something out. huh.

978
00:36:12.953 --> 00:36:13.786
(tapping back)

979
00:36:13.786 --> 00:36:14.619
Take care.

980
00:36:14.619 --> 00:36:15.452
- Bobby.

981
00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:18.177
Take it easy. Bobby.

982
00:36:20.138 --> 00:36:20.971
- Be safe.

983
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.898
- What's up. you all right?

984
00:36:22.898 --> 00:36:24.410
- Yeah. I'm going to hang
out here for a little bit.

985
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:25.730
- I'm going to get something
to eat. you hungry?

986
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:27.287
- No. no. it's okay but
get whatever you want.

987
00:36:27.287 --> 00:36:28.120
- All right.

988
00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:28.953
- All right. yeah.

989
00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.120
- Looks like you could use another one.

990
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.826
- I could. thank you.

991
00:36:38.826 --> 00:36:39.765
Sit down. sit down.

992
00:36:39.765 --> 00:36:40.765
- Thank you.

993
00:36:41.967 --> 00:36:42.927
Long day?

994
00:36:42.927 --> 00:36:44.480
- Everyday is a long day.

995
00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.883
- I do know that feeling.

996
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:47.860
- Well. you got to work tonight?

997
00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.053
I actually have the rest of the night off.

998
00:36:51.161 --> 00:36:52.040
- Really?

999
00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:52.873
- Yeah.

1000
00:36:56.481 --> 00:36:57.681
- You like to play pool?

1001
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.050
- Yeah. why?

1002
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.173
- Are you any good?

1003
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.910
- I'm all right.

1004
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:07.830
- Come over to my house.
we'd play some pool.

1005
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:08.830
- Are you serious?

1006
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:11.400
- Yeah. we play a little pool.

1007
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.410
Have a couple of drinks.

1008
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.610
Get our minds off things. you know?

1009
00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.180
- I'm supposed to go out with my friends.

1010
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.890
but honestly I'm just going to end up

1011
00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.370
eating pizza at home. watching TV.

1012
00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:23.413
- That sounds very exciting.

1013
00:37:23.413 --> 00:37:25.420
- Yeah. it's very exciting.

1014
00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.847
- Come on.

1015
00:37:26.847 --> 00:37:28.030
Live your life a little bit.

1016
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.670
Come on. look at this face. huh?

1017
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:31.503
Have a look at this face.

1018
00:37:31.503 --> 00:37:33.470
- It is very convincing.

1019
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:37.440
All right. I'll go grab my
purse. I will be right back.

1020
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.430
- All right. I'll be here.

1021
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:39.263
- Okay.

1022
00:37:41.186 --> 00:37:43.769
(techno music)

1023
00:37:46.087 --> 00:37:47.250
(chips clattering)

1024
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.320
- Let's see if you got lucky.

1025
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.314
- Oh. you ain't ready for it.

1026
00:37:50.314 --> 00:37:51.340
- I'm ready.

1027
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.260
- No. you're not.

1028
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.440
This game was over before it even starts.

1029
00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.273
- Oh no.

1030
00:37:59.594 --> 00:38:01.026
Transfer it and pay it.

1031
00:38:01.026 --> 00:38:02.354
- It ain't over yet player.

1032
00:38:02.354 --> 00:38:03.272
- It absolutely is.

1033
00:38:03.272 --> 00:38:04.105
- Hey. Marcus.

1034
00:38:04.105 --> 00:38:05.227
How you doing boys?

1035
00:38:05.227 --> 00:38:06.340
- Oh. look who it is.

1036
00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.190
Sonny Prima.

1037
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.023
What's going on. man.

1038
00:38:09.023 --> 00:38:09.856
Thanks for coming in.

1039
00:38:09.856 --> 00:38:10.689
What up Sonny?

1040
00:38:10.689 --> 00:38:11.627
- Hey man.

1041
00:38:11.627 --> 00:38:13.040
Thanks for calling me over I
appreciate you wanting to talk.

1042
00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.200
- Oh no. I got to talk to
our... what do you call him?

1043
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.033
Legend.

1044
00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:17.777
- Legends

1045
00:38:17.777 --> 00:38:18.903
(chuckling)

1046
00:38:18.903 --> 00:38:22.440
You know. I wouldn't
consider myself a legend.

1047
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.590
- Oh. I wouldn't either.

1048
00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:26.580
Legend is somebody who's
like old and respected.

1049
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:31.160
like you know. has hits
or catalog of music.

1050
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.530
You just old.

1051
00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:34.140
Matter of fact you saw. oh I
think you're going to see now.

1052
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.190
Cause you're not hearing
me when I'm saying

1053
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.850
our business is over.

1054
00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:38.683
- You're done?

1055
00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:40.070
- Your boys Nick came
to my club the other day

1056
00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:42.580
asking to renegotiate your contract.

1057
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.823
- You know what I think?

1058
00:38:43.823 --> 00:38:47.750
I think you misinterpreted my intentions.

1059
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:49.340
Yeah. I really do.

1060
00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.170
All I wanted him to do was to come here.

1061
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.000
talk to you about my situation.

1062
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.470
- Your intention is to rob me.

1063
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:57.680
I'm not letting you and those Goombas

1064
00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.180
take another dollar out of my pocket.

1065
00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.163
You know what?

1066
00:39:01.163 --> 00:39:03.160
I don't understand why
he doesn't understand

1067
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.700
how nice I'm being. just
letting him walk away.

1068
00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.630
- You misunderstood my
intention. forget it.

1069
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:07.620
- You are lucky.

1070
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.992
My boys haven't buried you by now.

1071
00:39:08.992 --> 00:39:09.825
- Oh really?

1072
00:39:09.825 --> 00:39:11.030
- Yeah. yeah.

1073
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.863
Old man.

1074
00:39:15.688 --> 00:39:18.438
(punch thudding)

1075
00:39:20.263 --> 00:39:23.013
(Sonny grunting)

1076
00:39:23.925 --> 00:39:26.175
(thudding)

1077
00:39:31.275 --> 00:39:34.025
(dramatic music)

1078
00:39:36.021 --> 00:39:37.780
(panting)

1079
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.525
- You drag this to the hospital
before it dies on my floor.

1080
00:39:41.525 --> 00:39:44.275
(dramatic music)

1081
00:39:49.865 --> 00:39:51.460
(glass toasting)

1082
00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.110
In Italian. we say "Salute"

1083
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.053
- Salute.

1084
00:39:54.053 --> 00:39:54.886
- Salute.

1085
00:39:54.886 --> 00:39:56.173
Hey. that's cool. That's cool.

1086
00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.217
All right I'm up.

1087
00:39:59.217 --> 00:40:00.170
- You're up.

1088
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:01.332
- I am up.

1089
00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:03.770
- Let me move this for you.

1090
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:05.090
- Are you single?

1091
00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:06.440
- Me? Oh yeah. definitely.

1092
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.830
I don't got time for that stuff.

1093
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:08.840
You kidding me?

1094
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.280
- I see you with lots of ladies.

1095
00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.070
- Those are only friends.

1096
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:16.024
- Friends? You have lots of friends.

1097
00:40:16.024 --> 00:40:17.424
- Yeah. I do.

1098
00:40:17.424 --> 00:40:19.728
(billiard balls rolling)

1099
00:40:19.728 --> 00:40:22.235
Honey. I don't think you'd
hit that as you were sober.

1100
00:40:22.235 --> 00:40:23.730
(Erica laughing)

1101
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.554
You really don't got no boyfriend.

1102
00:40:25.554 --> 00:40:27.645
- No. I have the worst luck with that.

1103
00:40:27.645 --> 00:40:29.145
I always choose the wrong one.

1104
00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:31.864
- It's their fault. not yours.

1105
00:40:31.864 --> 00:40:32.697
- It's their fault?

1106
00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:33.543
- Yeah. it's their loss.

1107
00:40:33.543 --> 00:40:34.376
- It's their loss?

1108
00:40:34.376 --> 00:40:35.209
- Exactly. high-five.

1109
00:40:35.209 --> 00:40:36.125
(hands hitting)
(Erica laughing)

1110
00:40:36.125 --> 00:40:36.958
I'm going to take this one.

1111
00:40:36.958 --> 00:40:37.946
Watch. watch this.

1112
00:40:37.946 --> 00:40:38.779
- You do it.

1113
00:40:38.779 --> 00:40:39.620
- All right.

1114
00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:40.823
So you from Miami?

1115
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:43.551
- Born and raised.

1116
00:40:43.551 --> 00:40:44.384
(billiard balls rolling and hitting)

1117
00:40:44.384 --> 00:40:45.217
- Nice.

1118
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.770
I'm from the East coast.

1119
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:49.170
- What brought you out here?

1120
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.670
The weather?

1121
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.260
- Actually. no.

1122
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.963
When I was 10 my parents
died in a car accident.

1123
00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.043
- Nick.

1124
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:02.563
I'm so sorry.

1125
00:41:02.563 --> 00:41:03.396
- Oh no. no. it's okay.

1126
00:41:03.396 --> 00:41:04.229
It's all right.

1127
00:41:04.229 --> 00:41:05.160
See. I didn't have no other family

1128
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.470
but my uncle Tony lived out here in Miami.

1129
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.203
So he brought me out
here and he raised me.

1130
00:41:12.361 --> 00:41:13.540
- Are you two close?

1131
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.610
- Oh yeah. yeah. yeah. He
was like a second father

1132
00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:17.189
and he was a good man.

1133
00:41:17.189 --> 00:41:19.370
He died a couple of years ago with cancer.

1134
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:20.203
Great guy.

1135
00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:22.997
- At least you had a father.

1136
00:41:22.997 --> 00:41:24.330
and you had two.

1137
00:41:25.454 --> 00:41:26.855
- Go ahead.

1138
00:41:26.855 --> 00:41:28.155
I want you to do this one.

1139
00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:29.973
Over there.

1140
00:41:29.973 --> 00:41:30.980
- I'll be.

1141
00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.260
- All right. I'm going to see you shoot.

1142
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:33.093
- Yeah.

1143
00:41:34.081 --> 00:41:35.410
Should I go for the green one?

1144
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:37.533
- Oh for whatever you want. sweetie.

1145
00:41:41.073 --> 00:41:42.150
- May I help you?

1146
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:43.080
- Yes. please do. Please do.

1147
00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.070
- All right. let me put this down.

1148
00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:45.316
It's real simple.

1149
00:41:45.316 --> 00:41:46.260
(Erica chuckling)

1150
00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.390
I mean. I can't look into this no more.

1151
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:49.778
It's crazy.

1152
00:41:49.778 --> 00:41:50.665
- Is it that bad?

1153
00:41:50.665 --> 00:41:51.700
- It is pretty bad.

1154
00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.940
And I'm an alcoholic and
I'm telling you this.

1155
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.258
So you get the white one.

1156
00:41:55.258 --> 00:41:57.837
Come here. come here. come here do it.

1157
00:41:57.837 --> 00:41:59.690
So you do like this.

1158
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:00.523
- Do I have it...

1159
00:42:00.523 --> 00:42:01.356
- Yeah. yeah.

1160
00:42:01.356 --> 00:42:02.897
- On my hands?

1161
00:42:02.897 --> 00:42:04.480
- Hold it. Hold it.

1162
00:42:05.357 --> 00:42:08.162
You got to do your hand like that.

1163
00:42:08.162 --> 00:42:10.829

Nicky don't want you around here.

1313
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.210

1319
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:17.320
- Because no one else can.

1320
00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.843

anything if you don't want to.

1321
00:51:18.843 --> 00:51:20.580

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:03.473
I got to use a little boy's room.

1452
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:05.343
- Hurry back.

1453
00:56:05.343 --> 00:56:06.430
- Oh. don't you worry.

1454
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:08.220
I'll be back.

1455
00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:10.780
Yipee. yipee. I'm an old cowboy.

1456
00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:13.147
I'm a cowboy who loves to sing. yipee yow.

1457
00:56:16.558 --> 00:56:20.600
I'm loving. I love. love.
love to be a cowboy.

1458
00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.806
A cowboy who knows how to love.

1459
00:56:23.806 --> 00:56:25.406
And I got a little lover.

1460
00:56:25.406 --> 00:56:26.823
I got a little lover.

1461
00:56:26.823 --> 00:56:30.580
coming out to see me or
I'm going to go see her.

1462
00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.980
Hey. sweet thing.

1463
00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:34.933
I'm coming out to see you.

1464
00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:37.033
Come on out.

1465
00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:39.573
What the hell?

1466
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:42.980
- Thank you Daphne. you go now.

1467
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:47.580
- Mayor Olson. how are you?

1468
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:50.950
- What do you want?

1469
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:52.240
- Nick Romano sent me over here.

1470
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.056
He want me to let you know Lou is dead.

1471
00:56:55.056 --> 00:56:56.800
- Nick's alive?

1472
00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.130
- He is very much.

1473
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:59.210
Unfortunately. we're not going to be able

1474
00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:00.530
to say the same thing for you.

1475
00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:01.670
- No. wait a minute. son.

1476
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:02.503
Hold on. boy.

1477
00:57:02.503 --> 00:57:04.604
Don't do anything you shouldn't.

1478
00:57:04.604 --> 00:57:07.187
(gun shooting)

1479
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.510
- It is with a heavy heart.

1480
00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:17.040
but I accept the succession

1481
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.460
for mayor of the City of Miami.

1482
00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.720
Mayor Olson was a mentor to me

1483
00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:26.040
and I will stop at nothing
until his murderers

1484
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.630
are brought to justice.

1485
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.690
My heart at this moment
goes out to his family.

1486
00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:34.240
I will do my best to make
Mayor Olson proud of me.

1487
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.976
God bless Miami and God bless America.

1488
00:57:37.976 --> 00:57:42.476
(reporters chattering simultaneously)

1489
00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:49.170
- Hey Marcus. I can't be standing up

1490
00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:50.600
in there for too long. man.

1491
00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.810
My lady's going to be wondering

1492
00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:53.460
what the hell happened to me. man.

1493
00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:54.593
- I'm trying to think!

1494
00:57:57.663 --> 00:58:00.160
All right. so the judge is
going to give us a bond.

1495
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.910
I'll call my lawyer. he know
how to get us out of here.

1496
00:58:05.854 --> 00:58:07.430
(exhales heavily)

1497
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:10.603
There cameras in my club. I'm
gonna find out who did this.

1498
00:58:10.603 --> 00:58:13.203
I know this was a set up
man. Miami's cops is dirty.

1499
00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.600
- Towns.

1500
00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.080
Let's go. you got a visitor.

1501
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:17.913
- Who?

1502
00:58:17.913 --> 00:58:18.850
- Who the hell I know?

1503
00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:19.983
You coming or not?

1504
00:58:21.931 --> 00:58:23.300
(keys rattling)

1505
00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.133
- Open it up.

1506
00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:29.263
- Nice and slow.

1507
00:58:31.610 --> 00:58:33.280
- Yo. I'll be back.

1508
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.113
- Come on.

1509
00:58:40.448 --> 00:58:42.340
(hand cuffs locking)

1510
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.840
Okay. he'll be right with you.

1511
00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:54.233
- Mr. Towns.

1512
00:58:56.288 --> 00:58:58.640
(door shutting)

1513
00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:02.197
Do you know who I am?

1514
00:59:02.197 --> 00:59:03.847
- You worked for the mayor right?

1515
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:09.340
- Actually. Mayor Olson was
murdered a couple of days ago

1516
00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:12.063
and I'm mayor now.

1517
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.273
- So?

1518
00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:16.980
- Do you know who this gentleman is?

1519
00:59:18.003 --> 00:59:18.953
- Yeah. I know you.

1520
00:59:19.972 --> 00:59:20.910
You Nick Romano's lawyer.

1521
00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:21.810
- That is correct.

1522
00:59:23.952 --> 00:59:25.202
- And what is this about?

1523
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:30.240
So what do you want?

1524
00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.520
- You're in a bad spot. right?

1525
00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:35.770
You're on parole and you're here.

1526
00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:38.560
You're on parole for gun charges. right?

1527
00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.393
- Stop.

1528
00:59:39.393 --> 00:59:40.226
- You're still on parole.

1529
00:59:40.226 --> 00:59:41.059
And then we add on that

1530
00:59:41.059 --> 00:59:43.170
you were caught with
marijuana two years ago.

1531
00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:46.970
- First of all. I've been clean for years.

1532
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:48.560
- Second. I'm not stupid to leave a brick

1533
00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.650
of cocaine in my own club.

1534
00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:51.110
You guys know who set me up?

1535
00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:52.223
- I don't know that.

1536
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:56.233
Look. man. I don't know you
could be right for all I know.

1537
00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.200
But the fact is my drug
enforcement officers.

1538
01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:06.680
they find a lot of narcotics
in your property. a lot.

1539
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.160
And now you add on those new charges now?

1540
01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.410
Come on. then you got about what is it.

1541
01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:11.350
10. 20. you were saying?

1542
01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:12.255
10. 20?

1543
01:00:12.255 --> 01:00:13.088
- Yeah.

1544
01:00:13.088 --> 01:00:13.921
- 10. 20.

1545
01:00:13.921 --> 01:00:15.000
Come on. man.

1546
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.203
Your assets get liquidated.

1547
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:21.383
No more money. you get out
of here when you're 60.

1548
01:00:21.383 --> 01:00:22.930
when you're 60 years old.

1549
01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:24.290
Come on. man.

1550
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:26.940
Well just in time for a
social security check. right?

1551
01:00:27.783 --> 01:00:31.190
That's one way of your life can go.

1552
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:32.990
That's one choice that you can make.

1553
01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:36.014
- How do I make this go away?

1554
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:47.210
- Mr. Romano wants to help you Marcus.

1555
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.480
If you let him. really.

1556
01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.973
I have two contracts here.

1557
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:57.700
First. is a full renewal

1558
01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.530
of Sony Prima's old contract

1559
01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:02.073
effective for the rest of his life.

1560
01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:07.793
Please sign.

1561
01:01:16.252 --> 01:01:18.750
The second contract is
bringing on Nick Romano

1562
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:20.812
as a 50% partner to your-

1563
01:01:20.812 --> 01:01:21.645
- What?

1564
01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:23.041
- You'll still run the company.

1565
01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:25.390
but you have to kick up
50% to Mr. Romano monthly.

1566
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:26.390
- That's bullshit.

1567
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:27.290
- Don't worry.

1568
01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:29.720
In the event. God forbid. that something

1569
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.081
already ever happened to Mr. Romano.

1570
01:01:32.081 --> 01:01:33.320
you would retain full control

1571
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.053
of your company and vice versa.

1572
01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.843
It's up to you. Marcus.

1573
01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.450
What do you say?

1574
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:42.650
- I'm on a fucking curb.

1575
01:01:44.183 --> 01:01:46.933
(rhythmic music)

1576
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:55.110
- Perfect.

1577
01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:57.113
I will file these right away.

1578
01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.030
- Inside.

1579
01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:01.620
Get you out of here in
a couple of minutes.

1580
01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:02.840
- Thank you. Marcus.

1581
01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.690
Mr. Romano is looking forward
to doing business with you.

1582
01:02:06.569 --> 01:02:09.402
(chairs creaking)

1583
01:02:12.113 --> 01:02:14.863
(dramatic music)

1584
01:02:18.132 --> 01:02:19.132
- How you doing. pal?

1585
01:02:19.132 --> 01:02:21.882
Let's get you out of those cuffs.

1586
01:02:28.992 --> 01:02:30.757
(chains clanging)

1587
01:02:30.757 --> 01:02:33.507
(sinister music)

1588
01:02:39.678 --> 01:02:40.939
(Marcus grunting)

1589
01:02:40.939 --> 01:02:43.689
(sinister music)

1590
01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.360
- So I spoke to the doctor

1591
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.630
and thank God Sonny's going to be okay.

1592
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:17.262
- Nice. Good.

1593
01:03:17.262 --> 01:03:18.507
- He's good.

1594
01:03:18.507 --> 01:03:21.190
- So I got some more good news.

1595
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.440
All the paper works been signed off on.

1596
01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.970
We start construction in
the casino in about a month.

1597
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:27.923
- Hey.

1598
01:03:27.923 --> 01:03:29.146
- Salute for that.

1599
01:03:29.146 --> 01:03:29.979
- Salute.

1600
01:03:29.979 --> 01:03:32.729
(glass toasting)

1601
01:03:35.952 --> 01:03:37.730
- So listen guys. I got
to tell you something.

1602
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:38.630
- What's going on?

1603
01:03:40.889 --> 01:03:42.860
- I'm going to go to
Sicily for a few months.

1604
01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:45.560
- Sicily? Sure about that?

1605
01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.393
- I'll be fine.

1606
01:03:46.393 --> 01:03:48.290
We're connected over there.

1607
01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:49.220
- It's not what I'm saying.

1608
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:52.363
I just... Think it's a good time?

1609
01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.150
- We got a lot of heat on us right now.

1610
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:59.220
It's smart if I go away for awhile.

1611
01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.053
- That make sense.

1612
01:04:00.053 --> 01:04:01.240
- Until things cool down.

1613
01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.770
- Things cool down?

1614
01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:07.840
You're going to be here
for the opening. right?

1615
01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.950
- Oh yeah. don't worry.

1616
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:10.730
I'm not missing that.

1617
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:12.716
Nick Romano Casino. yeah!

1618
01:04:12.716 --> 01:04:13.830
(men laughing)

1619
01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:16.713
- Okay. we'll keep things
running till you get back.

1620
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:18.983
- While I'm gone.

1621
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.700
Bobby's acting boss.

1622
01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:25.590
- Nicky?

1623
01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:27.510
- [Anthony] Hey! All right.

1624
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:28.583
- Congratulations kid.

1625
01:04:28.583 --> 01:04:30.060
- Thanks. All right.

1626
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.253
- One last thing guys.

1627

You're old country.

- Yeah. for a few months.

1656
01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:36.890

It's a beautiful house

1661
01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.210
your grandfather built when he was alive.

1662
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:47.000
Remember now. I'm glad
you kept it all this time.

1663
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.260
- You know uncle Tony.

1664
01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:50.260
he was wanting to keep it in the family.

1665
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:54.630
- I'm gonna tell you something
I never told you before.

1666
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:57.370
He was very proud of you
and the way you turned out.

1667
01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.867
- He said that?

1668
01:05:58.867 --> 01:06:00.280

would tell me everything.

Thank you for everything and I mean it.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:14.770
- You don't have to thank me. Sonny.

1675
01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.870
All you got to do is get better

1676
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:20.420
'cause I needed to perform
opening night in my casino

1677
01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:21.633

1678
01:06:21.633 --> 01:06:22.830
(Sonny laughing)

1679
01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:23.663

Listen. I got to go.

1683
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.720
I'm going to go or I'm
going to miss my flight.

1684
01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.890
If you need anything whatsoever
while I'm gone. anything.

1685
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:33.950
call the boys.

1686
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:36.200
Anthony. Bobby. they'll take care.

1687
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.320

(speaking in Italian)

1691
01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:51.623
- You know you are living
the American dream.

1692
01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:53.583
- Yeah. I guess I am.

1693
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:56.719
Take it easy. Sonny.

1694
01:06:56.719 --> 01:06:58.704
- Have a safe flight. kid.

1695
01:06:58.704 --> 01:07:01.454
(dramatic music)

1696
01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.167
- [Nick] I didn't turn out so bad.

1697
01:07:24.167 --> 01:07:26.300
- [Tony Romano] No. you
didn't turn out too bad.

1698
01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.840
You turned out good.

1699
01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:30.013
And look at you. it's like my son.
