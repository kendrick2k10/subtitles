4
00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.166
Are we walking
across the projects?

5
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.666
The buildings are connected.

6
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.916
We came in through
the Rose des Vents side.

7
00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:34.000
now we're headed
through Lily of the Valley.

8
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.833
How's that gonna help us?
We ain't gonna find any lilies here.

9
00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:40.375
Trust me. okay?
I'm point one percent Cherokee.

10
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.458
It's that way.

11
00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:47.166
I was a Boy Scout too.

12
00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:50.583
Delta One to base.
Delta One to base.

13
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.958
We need your position. guys.

14
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.916
We're in a corridor
that leads to other corridors.

15
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.333
Ousmane. where are we?

16
00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:58.875
We went right. left. blue door.

17
00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.541
so we go right…

18
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.875
Right. Green door.

19
00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:03.833
-This way.
-Green.

20
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.791
Ready to arrest
the most wanted man in Europe?

21
00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:14.708
Uh-uh.

22
00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:16.791
That was rhetorical.

23
00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:18.750
Whoo!

24
00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:30.875
Get up!

25
00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.958
-Is Diaz down there?
-Yeah.

26
00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:36.583
-Shall we call for backup?
-No. Not until we spot him.

27
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500
He's the shrimp. see?
Like an unhot Timothée Chalamet.

28
00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:53.875
He just showed up again after three years.

29
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.000
Where you at. little shrimp?

30
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:11.833
Where are you hiding?

31
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.750
How we feelin'?

32
00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.041
I said. how are we feelin'?

33
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:20.041
The monster…

34
00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.750
Jordan Diaz!

35
00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:27.041
I can't hear you! Make some noise!

36
00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:28.625
Damn. the shrimp bulked up.

37
00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:30.791
Yaaah!

38
00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:34.541
-How old is that photo?
-Three years. Must be the hair.

39
00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:37.291
-Hair changes everything.
-This guy's got…

40
00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:39.541
You still don't wanna call for backup?

41
00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:40.916
I said. yeah!

42
00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:43.083
Five win--

43
00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:44.708
-Can you hear me?
-Oh shit.

44
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:48.333
Make as much noise as you can
for my man Diaz!

45
00:02:48.416 --> 00:02:49.958
The man of the hour! Give it up!

46
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:51.875
Give it up for that fight!

47
00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958
Everybody havin' a good time?

48
00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:57.083
Great. Now go home.
We're takin' the champ to the precinct.

49
00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:03.041
Cops are surrounding the building.
Let's just play nice.

50
00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:07.541
Easy. Jordan.
All right. everyone get outta here.

51
00:03:10.458 --> 00:03:11.291
Aah!

52
00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:13.375
You think you're tough?
Let's see what you got.

53
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.000
Oh. you wanna go? Let's go.

54
00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:26.916
Here.

55
00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:39.041
-I was wrong. Call for backup!
-Let's go!

56
00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:40.375
Call for backup!

57
00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:43.000
-Huh?
-Call…

58
00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:44.625
…for backup…

59
00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:48.833
All right. guys. This is it.
Come on. move. move. move!

60
00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:52.625
Go. go. go. go. go. go!

61
00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:06.541
Come on. come on. come on! Go. go. go!

62
00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:16.041
-Okay. so…
-Right…

63
00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:18.166
-Go right--
-No. the blue one.

64
00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:20.666
Are you sure that's blue?

65
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.208
It looks more chartreuse.

66
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.833
Let's go. Ousmane!

67
00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:44.083
Get him!

68
00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:51.208
Police!

69
00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.541
Police. hands up!
Don't move! What is that?

70
00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:55.833
-Garbage?
-Drop it!

71
00:04:56.916 --> 00:04:58.333
Plastics go in that bin!

72
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:01.833
I swear to God. I recycle!

73
00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:04.166
-It ain't him.
-To the rear. To the rear!

74
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.416
Damn. the garbage police don't play!

75
00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.833
Police!

76
00:05:27.916 --> 00:05:30.291
Go. go. go! Nobody move!

77
00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:32.208
Don't move! Hands up!

78
00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.208
Police!

79
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:37.375
Nobody move! Nobody move!

80
00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:40.875
-You're not gettin' out of this. dude.
-Get off me!

81
00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.833
-No way. All right?
-Don't move!

82
00:05:42.916 --> 00:05:46.833
Take care of him. Come here! Get him.
Hey. You with the megaphone.

83
00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:49.375
Come here. Tell us who won tonight.

84
00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:52.000
-And tonight's winner is…
-The police!

85
00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:54.666
The police.

86
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.916
No. no. no. And tonight's winner is…

87
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.958
-The winner is…
-The police!

88
00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:02.208
-The police!
-The police! The police!

89
00:06:02.291 --> 00:06:04.958
The police! The police! The police!

90
00:06:05.041 --> 00:06:08.625
The police! The police!
The police! The police!

91
00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:13.875
The police! The police! The police!
The police! The police! The police…

92
00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:19.666
Okay. Captain Monge.

93
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.583
So. you're currently deputy chief
at the 12th District Judicial Police.

94
00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:25.250
-Do I have that--
-I mean. deputy?

95
00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:27.125
You're not a deputy?

96
00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:29.458
-I'm more like an associate chief.
-You're a deputy.

97
00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:31.291
Sure.

98
00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:33.791
You took the police chief's exam
three times.

99
00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:36.541
-You failed.
-I don't really think of them as failures.

100
00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:39.666
Five transfer requests
to the Criminal Division. Antiterrorism.

101
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.333
personal security detail…

102
00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:42.875
-All dead ends.
-Hmm.

103
00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.000
Anything to add to that?

104
00:06:44.666 --> 00:06:46.458
Well. to quote Amin Maalouf.

105
00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:49.916
"Love lives on patience
as much as desire."

106
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.833
Nice. right?

107
00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:54.541
-You know Amin Maalouf?
-I'm talking about your career.

108
00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:56.708
-Okay.
-Do you know why you're here today?

109
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.916
-No.
-Are you sure about that?

110
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.625
Repeating yourself won't change the truth.

111
00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:03.750
-And what do you think the truth is?
-I don't know. Why don't you tell me?

112
00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:06.291
-No. This isn't an interrogation.
-Are you sure?

113
00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:09.166
-I could invoke the Fifth Amendment.
-This isn't the US.

114
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.375
Pleading the Fifth to your therapist
is a little counterproductive.

115
00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:16.916
Mmm. Do I know her?

116
00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:19.958
-Work or pleasure?
-Work.

117
00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:21.916
Well. that narrows it down.

118
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.291
No. not familiar. no.

119
00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:26.583
-Clarissa Malbec. Arrested for burglaries.
-Right. Clarissa. yeah.

120
00:07:26.666 --> 00:07:28.333
She was quite the clever one.

121
00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:31.541
During her interrogation.
you allegedly said to her.

122
00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:34.291
"If you snitch on your partner.
I'll take you to the Tour d'Argent."

123
00:07:34.375 --> 00:07:35.583
"The duck is to die for."

124
00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:39.125
-Could be. It's possible.
-And you don't find that strange?

125
00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:41.125
No. Why? Are you vegetarian?

126
00:07:41.791 --> 00:07:43.875
Your colleagues think you're a liability.

127
00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.291
They think you might have
a severe superiority complex.

128
00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:49.958
Oh. no. I have absolutely no complexes.

129
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.125
Do you really think that dinner with you

130
00:07:53.208 --> 00:07:55.750
could possibly be more tempting
than a plea bargain?

131
00:07:55.833 --> 00:07:58.125
Now you're the one getting philosophical.

132
00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:01.500
I wouldn't mind exploring this with you
over a nice dinner.

133
00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:03.208
I'll even let you choose the place.

134
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.541
All right. Um…

135
00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:08.375
-I think I've heard all I need to hear.
-Mmm.

136
00:08:08.458 --> 00:08:10.958
-So. thank you.
-Oh. you can thank me later.

137
00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:12.750
What do you mean?

138
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.250
Aaah! Don't do that.

139
00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:22.166
Careful.

140
00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:24.041
It's cashmere.

141
00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:26.125
-Oh. okay…
-Yeah. sorry.

142
00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:29.083
Oh. yeah.

143
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.375
Up there.

144
00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:42.708
It's crazy how much
you look like your dad.

145
00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:46.166
-Yeah. it's the nose. The family nose.
-Mm-hm.

146
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.958
You mind making love
in your parents' room?

147
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:49.166
Why would I?

148
00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:51.041
Very Freudian of you.

149
00:08:51.666 --> 00:08:52.625
They're never here.

150
00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:54.708
I don't have to pay rent.

151
00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:57.375
And I'm considerate.
I always change the sheets.

152
00:08:57.458 --> 00:08:59.291
Hmm. Could you put some music on?
This is weird.

153
00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:02.208
Do you know why Enzo Ferrari
didn't want a radio in his car?

154
00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:04.916
-I don't.
-He wanted to hear the engine purring.

155
00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:08.541
Huh.

156
00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:11.916
Are you always this meticulous
about everything?

157
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.083
No.

158
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.833
Oh. We both agree
ripping off clothes is sexy. right?

159
00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:21.291
-Uh. yeah.
-You consent?

160
00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:23.708
-Of course.
-I haven't manipulated you?

161
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:26.166
-No. no manipulation.
-This isn't a quid pro quo deal?

162
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.708
-For real?
-I know.

163
00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:29.750
-But you can't do anything these days.
-Shut up.

164
00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:39.916
You're leaving?

165
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.041
I have some smoked salmon.
Wild-caught. hand-sliced. Champagne.

166
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.791
Sounds nice. but I should go.

167
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:48.125
Goodbye. And thanks.

168
00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:49.958
You're welcome. Thank you.

169
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:52.208
My phone number's probably in my file. hm?

170
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.833
-Call me if you want.
-Oh. please.

171
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.166
I'm glad you're okay with this.

172
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.500
People are too quick
to dismiss all men as bastards.

173
00:09:58.583 --> 00:09:59.750
People overthink things.

174
00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.166
-I'm fine with this.
-Hm.

175
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.041
You hit a piece of ass for narcissistic
pleasure. What's the problem?

176
00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:06.291
For the record.
you're more than a piece of ass.

177
00:10:06.375 --> 00:10:07.458
Wasn't talking about me.

178
00:10:08.083 --> 00:10:09.625
-Ah.
-All right. Bye.

179
00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:13.958
See you.

180
00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:18.291
-So. Diakité.
-The fight. Let me explain--

181
00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:19.791
-No need.
-Actually--

182
00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:23.541
Yeah. I know. I get it.

183
00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:27.166
That's just a snippet out of context.
It's tough to understand.

184
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.708
You really have to see the first part.
At the beginning…

185
00:10:30.416 --> 00:10:33.291
No. That's not far back enough.
Go just a little before that.

186
00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:36.291
That's too far back. There's one part--

187
00:10:36.375 --> 00:10:37.875
-Shall I continue?
-No. it's all good.

188
00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.500
Over 500.000 views.

189
00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:42.125
You're unmanageable and obsessive.
and you've gone…

190
00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:43.250
viral.

191
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:46.833
They're talking about you at the ministry.
Know what they're saying?

192
00:10:48.208 --> 00:10:50.083
That you're made to be in the limelight.

193
00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:52.916
I'm sure you're aware
we're in the midst of a PR crisis.

194
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.875
especially with a certain
part of the population.

195
00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.875
Hey. I've always said that.
The problem is our image.

196
00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.333
Then again. I'm just a cop.
I'm not the police.

197
00:11:00.416 --> 00:11:02.250
Exactly right.
And we're gonna change that.

198
00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:04.958
You're going to become
the face of the national police force.

199
00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:06.041
Méaux?

200
00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.500
-Hi.
-Allow me to present Benoît Méaux.

201
00:11:09.583 --> 00:11:11.541
He's our communications director.

202
00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:15.458
So what we want
for our next campaign is a hero.

203
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:19.208
An accessible. normal man
with incredible skills and prowess.

204
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:21.083
A policeman 2.0.

205
00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:23.375
represented by someone relatable

206
00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:27.083
who happens to also have
a pre-existing fanbase online.

207
00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:28.000
You.

208
00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:29.000
Me?

209
00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:33.083
This means we need to create
a digital ecosystem using your image.

210
00:11:33.166 --> 00:11:36.791
That means YouTube. Facebook.
Insta. Snapchat and. of course. TikTok.

211
00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:40.583
so that people can follow your daily life
like you're their friend.

212
00:11:41.166 --> 00:11:45.125
And to top it all off.
a publicity spot for all platforms.

213
00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:47.458
LIBERTY. EQUALITY. FRATERNITY

214
00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:49.791
A message
from the Interior Ministry.

215
00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:51.666
Stop! Thief! Thief!

216
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.333
Commitment.

217
00:11:54.291 --> 00:11:56.583
Discipline. Resilience.

218
00:11:57.708 --> 00:11:59.000
Courage.

219
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:01.791
Selflessness.

220
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:05.375
Integrity.

221
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.333
Strength.

222
00:12:10.708 --> 00:12:12.208
Join the National Police.

223
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.666
Your adventure starts here.
Recruiting now.

224
00:12:16.333 --> 00:12:17.625
So…

225
00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:19.958
What did you think of that?

226
00:12:20.541 --> 00:12:21.791
-Wait. is he for real?
-Very.

227
00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:23.041
Hang on a second.

228
00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:25.041
I'm unmanageable and obsessive.

229
00:12:25.125 --> 00:12:26.833
You said so. Why would you choose me?

230
00:12:26.916 --> 00:12:27.791
People like rebels.

231
00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:29.708
-Plus. you're a great father.
-Mmm.

232
00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:31.291
You're likable.

233
00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:33.375
Aah! There we are!

234
00:12:33.916 --> 00:12:35.541
I think I understand.

235
00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:37.333
Okay. How am I likable?

236
00:12:37.416 --> 00:12:39.208
-Uh…
-Mmm… mmm?

237
00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:40.541
-Méaux?
-Go ahead. Go on.

238
00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:41.875
Umm…

239
00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.291
-You're cool?
-No.

240
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.250
-Uh. you…
-Need a hint? Look at this.

241
00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:50.291
-You're handsome?
-No. Look at it. Look at it.

242
00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:52.125
-You're likable. as in charming.
-Mm-hm.

243
00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:54.166
-You're cute. I don't--
-Another hint? B…

244
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.625
-Buh?
-Buh. Buhh…

245
00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.000
-Buh. Buh. Buh…
-Buh?

246
00:12:57.083 --> 00:12:58.541
-Bluh…
-Bluh? Buh?

247
00:12:58.625 --> 00:12:59.583
Bluhhh…

248
00:12:59.666 --> 00:13:00.833
-Black?
-Oh. no.

249
00:13:00.916 --> 00:13:02.750
-Right? I'm a likable Black guy. That it?
-Oh!

250
00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:04.541
-Stop it. That's an order.
-No.

251
00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:07.416
I'm not gonna play the nice Black cop
to cover up the force's mistakes.

252
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.541
Don't be so dramatic.
We're just asking you to be yourself.

253
00:13:10.625 --> 00:13:14.458
A symbol of the successful integration
of minorities into our institution.

254
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:16.708
Know where you can stick your symbol?

255
00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:25.250
Hey. how'd it go?

256
00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:28.833
Great. Went well. Sounds like
you've been talking behind my back. hm?

257
00:13:28.916 --> 00:13:30.791
So now I'm a liability to investigations?

258
00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:33.833
If you have something to say.
go ahead. Who wants to start?

259
00:13:33.916 --> 00:13:34.750
No one? No? Hm?

260
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:36.291
Look. you're just…

261
00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:37.833
sort of a loudmouth.

262
00:13:37.916 --> 00:13:39.166
A loudmouth?

263
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.125
-Meaning?
-You brag a lot.

264
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.333
-You're kind of a perv.
-A perv?

265
00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:45.750
-Sorry for being hands-on.
-You never listen to anything--

266
00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:47.458
-What?
-You always have to talk.

267
00:13:47.541 --> 00:13:50.208
-You're always checking me out.
-No. I don't check you out. No.

268
00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:52.166
-You wish.
-You're a dick. François.

269
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.583
The truth hurts. but you are.
You're sexist. not funny.

270
00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:55.833
And you're full of yourself.

271
00:13:55.916 --> 00:13:57.166
-Full of myself?
-Yeah!

272
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.708
And your cologne sucks.

273
00:13:59.416 --> 00:14:02.708
-It's a fragrance. and it's CK One.
-It smells like the back seat of an Uber.

274
00:14:03.291 --> 00:14:06.208
Newsflash. You're too old for
that hipster beard and metrosexual pants.

275
00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:08.208
-You're too tall.
-Metrosexual?

276
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:09.875
They're slim fit. Excuse me for trying.

277
00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958
Just 'cause we're cops. doesn't mean we
have to get clothes from a dumpster.

278
00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:16.333
Oh shit.

279
00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:18.166
Oh. you got me.

280
00:14:18.666 --> 00:14:20.750
-Uh…
-You guys are really good.

281
00:14:20.833 --> 00:14:23.458
You guys are really good.
You almost had me.

282
00:14:23.541 --> 00:14:25.208
-I almost bought it…
-You serious?

283
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:27.416
Khadija made a joke about Ubers.
I thought. "Oh!"

284
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.291
Oh! You all deserve Oscars.

285
00:14:29.375 --> 00:14:31.708
Keep it classy. De Niro!

286
00:14:31.791 --> 00:14:33.166
Come on. get to work.

287
00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:36.750
That was dumb.

288
00:14:36.833 --> 00:14:38.833
Does he really think
we're joking?

289
00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.083
Full of myself…

290
00:14:40.166 --> 00:14:41.708
I just don't like him.

291
00:14:54.708 --> 00:14:55.541
Yves?

292
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.416
Just came to drop off some groceries.
Can you give me a hand?

293
00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:02.250
Babe. are you crying?

294
00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:04.083
-Are you okay?
-Wait. wait…

295
00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:07.291
Oh man.

296
00:15:10.875 --> 00:15:12.833
-Hello.
-Hello.

297
00:15:12.916 --> 00:15:15.125
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye. Yeah. bye.

298
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.208
Take it easy.

299
00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:20.708
What's the deal. Dad? I thought you were
going to work after the store?

300
00:15:20.791 --> 00:15:22.625
Yeah. that's right. But. um…

301
00:15:23.208 --> 00:15:26.458
-I got frozen food I need to put away.
-Did you get my Monster Crunch?

302
00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:31.208
-Yves? Care to explain?
-Nothin' to explain. Pop.

303
00:15:31.291 --> 00:15:33.666
-At least someone's makin' love here.
-What'd you say?

304
00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:37.166
At least someone's gettin' laid
in this apartment.

305
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.750
You better watch how you speak to me.

306
00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:41.208
Yves. I'm not one of your buddies.

307
00:15:41.708 --> 00:15:44.333
-You're right. I'm sorry. My bad.
-Okay. then.

308
00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.083
Ah!

309
00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:02.500
-Aah!
-How are you?

310
00:16:02.583 --> 00:16:04.083
Sorry. there was traffic.

311
00:16:04.166 --> 00:16:06.291
You shouldn't have bothered.
I booked a taxi.

312
00:16:06.375 --> 00:16:08.708
-I said I'd come pick you up.
-That's what I said.

313
00:16:08.791 --> 00:16:11.541
I was hoping he'd have something better
to do in the middle of the day.

314
00:16:11.625 --> 00:16:13.958
-I'm happy to do it.
-Are you available tomorrow night?

315
00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:14.875
For?

316
00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.791
You know!
It's Didier's wife's birthday.

317
00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.958
At the Ministry.
There'll be important people.

318
00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:20.583
-Daddy can introduce you.
-I'm not ten.

319
00:16:20.666 --> 00:16:23.291
-I can make friends on my own.
-Leave him alone. He's fine.

320
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:26.250
Out of the way. kids!
Excuse me! Excuse--

321
00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:32.291
Oh my God. Is that an arm?

322
00:16:32.375 --> 00:16:35.250
Move over. Police.
Move. Move. Police.

323
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.375
-Hey. Djimo.
-Ous. we got somethin' at Lyon station.

324
00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:46.708
-Hurry up.
-I'm on my way.

325
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.375
-Djimo!
-Hey.

326
00:16:52.458 --> 00:16:54.833
-What's up?
-12th District Police beat us here.

327
00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:55.750
Okay.

328
00:16:56.791 --> 00:16:59.375
-Keep going. Pretend I'm not here.
-Yeah. sure thing.

329
00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:03.416
Wait. Excuse me. I'm actually with them.

330
00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:07.291
You see that guy with the cellphone?

331
00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:09.750
He just tried to sell me molly.
Have a nice day.

332
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.041
-Step over this way. sir.
-Uh-- Look. I'm with him.

333
00:17:13.125 --> 00:17:14.541
-I'm police.
-Sure.

334
00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:15.958
-IT department.
-Spread your legs.

335
00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:17.458
-You didn't hear?
-No!

336
00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:20.166
-Passengers alerted me about a loud noise.
-Hang on.

337
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.291
-At which point on the journey…
-Hang on.

338
00:17:23.666 --> 00:17:25.166
All right. young man. that's enough.

339
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.208
-I'll take it from here.
-No. I'm police.

340
00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:29.083
-François Monge.
-Oh!

341
00:17:29.166 --> 00:17:31.333
-No! Ousmane. I can't believe it!
-Hey. man!

342
00:17:31.416 --> 00:17:32.791
-What are you doing here?
-You know…

343
00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:35.458
-Oh man! Been a while. Gosh.
-That's for sure.

344
00:17:36.041 --> 00:17:37.208
Oh. hello. How are you?

345
00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:39.041
-François.
-You two go back a ways?

346
00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:40.875
-Pfft…
-Oh. man. we were partners back in…

347
00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.291
-When was that…
-Oh. yeah. yeah.

348
00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:44.166
I wouldn't say
I boosted him up the ladder…

349
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.500
No. no. I wouldn't say that. No.

350
00:17:47.875 --> 00:17:51.958
-Can you go talk to the witnesses?
-Yeah. Can I talk to you for a minute?

351
00:17:53.416 --> 00:17:54.833
-It's really good to see you.
-Yeah.

352
00:17:54.916 --> 00:17:56.666
-You look fantastic.
-I'm okay. Look at you!

353
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.750
-Mmm.
-You look fit. You working out more?

354
00:17:58.833 --> 00:18:00.666
Yeah. you've… put on some weight.

355
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.833
-Yeah.
-That's aging. I'm staying in shape.

356
00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.291
Don't know about that.

357
00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:06.875
-I think you look a little pudgy.
-Oh. yeah? Really?

358
00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:10.000
-Anything new with you?
-Pretty much same old. same old.

359
00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:12.666
-I'm captain of the Criminal Division now.
-Mmm?

360
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.916
-I even have my own team. So. yeah.
-Yeah? Great.

361
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.625
-Congratulations. That's great.
-Thanks.

362
00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:19.958
-Uh. and you?
-I'm still at the 12th. It's great.

363
00:18:20.625 --> 00:18:21.458
Glad to hear that.

364
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:22.750
-Yeah. it's been good.
-Yeah?

365
00:18:22.833 --> 00:18:25.000
I wanted to return to fundamentals.

366
00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:27.166
Uh. back to basics.
It's been so enriching.

367
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.291
Mmm.

368
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.083
-Wanna tell me?
-What?

369
00:18:32.166 --> 00:18:33.958
-Whose wife you slept with?
-What do you mean?

370
00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:37.750
Uh. you expect me to believe you left
Criminal Division 'cause you felt like it?

371
00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:40.541
-Sounds punitive.
-I just told you it's been very enriching.

372
00:18:40.625 --> 00:18:42.625
-Oh. yeah?
-Not all of us are careerists.

373
00:18:42.708 --> 00:18:43.750
No. no. I understand.

374
00:18:43.833 --> 00:18:46.958
-Not all of us cut throats to get ahead.
-Ah. ah. ah!

375
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:49.000
-No. wait. I'm not saying you.
-Yeah?

376
00:18:49.083 --> 00:18:50.791
-Right!
-Just. work's not everything.

377
00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:53.333
Is there a Mrs. Monge in your life
besides your mom?

378
00:18:53.416 --> 00:18:54.708
No. Hey. you know me.

379
00:18:54.791 --> 00:18:56.875
-No woman on Earth can tie me down.
-Right!

380
00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.375
-Well. she better hurry.
-Oh. yeah?

381
00:18:58.458 --> 00:19:00.208
Or there's gonna be a huge age difference.

382
00:19:00.291 --> 00:19:03.250
Yeah. well. I'm maturing.

383
00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:06.666
-I'm going from a hellcat to a lone wolf.
-Yeah. yeah. Not bad.

384
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.708
-How about you?
-I'm the same way.

385
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:11.125
-Good on my own. Chillin'.
-Oh. yeah?

386
00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.291
That's just great.

387
00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.750
-So. uh… where's the medical examiner?
-Uh…

388
00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:20.750
The new guy was here. but he saw the body.
got squeamish and took off.

389
00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:23.041
-Is it that bad?
-Let's have a look.

390
00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:31.458
Hmm.

391
00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:35.208
No identification. Cause of death unknown.

392
00:19:35.291 --> 00:19:37.625
-And the other half?
-This is the half we found.

393
00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:40.916
-Um…
-We'll let you finish up. Thanks a lot.

394
00:19:41.708 --> 00:19:44.291
-Let's catch up. It was great to see you.
-Yeah. it was.

395
00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:47.000
Could you show me around
the new Crime Division offices?

396
00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:49.791
-Oh. no. they're not… No. seriously--
-I heard they're awesome.

397
00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:51.541
-Great. we can ride together.
-But--

398
00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:54.541
Lot of space.

399
00:19:55.541 --> 00:19:58.000
But it's a little-- little cold.
don't you think?

400
00:19:58.708 --> 00:20:02.750
It just feels less personal
than a district station.

401
00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:09.416
Ousmane. the Saint-Julien-en-Genevois
station found a guy's legs

402
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.083
on a train track outside Valergnes.

403
00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:12.333
His name was Kevin Marchal.

404
00:20:12.416 --> 00:20:15.000
-Oh. that's for me. I got it.
-Uh… Who's this?

405
00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:17.708
Sorry. Lieutenant Monge
from the 12th District.

406
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:20.083
-Hi. everyone. At ease.
-Uh. hi.

407
00:20:20.166 --> 00:20:21.500
-He called in the body.
-Yeah.

408
00:20:21.583 --> 00:20:24.250
Guy probably got his heart broken
and just couldn't live any--

409
00:20:24.333 --> 00:20:27.750
-Wow. No. Two bullets in his thighs.
-Well. then it's a homicide. I call dibs!

410
00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:31.375
What?

411
00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:34.666
What is it?

412
00:20:36.041 --> 00:20:38.083
{\an8}WHEN DUTY CALLS

413
00:20:40.125 --> 00:20:41.750
I'll tell the DA. Call Valergnes.

414
00:20:41.833 --> 00:20:43.750
-I'll be back three days tops.
-On it.

415
00:20:43.833 --> 00:20:46.458
Oh. this is great.
Just the kind of content we need.

416
00:20:46.541 --> 00:20:47.708
No. you're not coming.

417
00:20:47.791 --> 00:20:49.666
-Uh…
-It's too dangerous. Too risky.

418
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.833
-Can't bring civilians. It's low-profile.
-But I have--

419
00:20:51.916 --> 00:20:53.625
I'm going undercover. Thanks. bye.

420
00:20:54.541 --> 00:20:57.000
-What just happened?
-That's my Ousmane!

421
00:20:57.083 --> 00:21:00.250
Intrepid! Bold!
Getting the old team back together.

422
00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:02.125
What team?

423
00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:09.750
Hey. wait. Ousmane.
This is my case. You can't do this to me.

424
00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:12.708
-Now's not the time.
-Actually. it is. I found the body.

425
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:15.750
It's cut in two. so we each get a half.
I'm okay with that.

426
00:21:15.833 --> 00:21:16.791
François?

427
00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:19.208
You're district. I'm Criminal Division.

428
00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:21.750
How would we team up?
There's no protocol whatsoever.

429
00:21:21.833 --> 00:21:25.500
That's your excuse? All right.
You used to be more fun.

430
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.708
-Oh. I see! Is this about Yasmine? Huh?
-About Yasmine?

431
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:33.500
-Yeah. about the fling I had with her.
-You really think I care?

432
00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:35.000
You were crazy about her.

433
00:21:35.083 --> 00:21:36.750
Oh. come on. She's just a good friend.

434
00:21:36.833 --> 00:21:37.666
-Ousmane.
-What?

435
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.041
-Dude!
-What? Come on.

436
00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:41.500
Back then. it was enough
to make you totally ghost me.

437
00:21:41.583 --> 00:21:43.291
-You're kidding. I ghosted you?
-Come on!

438
00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:45.541
I left you all those voicemails
after the captain exam.

439
00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:46.791
You never called me back.

440
00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:49.791
If you could have seen yourself.
laughing at everything she said.

441
00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:51.458
too chickenshit to make a move.

442
00:21:52.333 --> 00:21:54.583
Yeah. sorry I decided
to take the initiative.

443
00:21:54.666 --> 00:21:57.916
You probably wish hittin' on girls
was part of the exam.

444
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.500
You might have passed.

445
00:21:59.583 --> 00:22:01.333
-That was small of you.
-No. that's small.

446
00:22:01.416 --> 00:22:04.375
Hey. at least I didn't burn my tip
on the urinal cake.

447
00:22:04.458 --> 00:22:06.416
You're pissin' in Morse code. you weirdo.

448
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.416
-Huh?
-See a doctor. drippy.

449
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.583
-Wait. Ousmane--
-I'm not walking you out.

450
00:22:12.666 --> 00:22:13.625
Hey. wait!

451
00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.250
Shit! Uh…

452
00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:19.750
Ousmane! Oh shit…

453
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.791
Come on. You can't deny
we had something real.

454
00:22:22.875 --> 00:22:25.041
Right? We were a good team. a unit. a duo.

455
00:22:25.125 --> 00:22:26.958
We were besties. pals. buddies.

456
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:28.458
You got a thesaurus on you?

457
00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:29.791
Yeah. after that. we split up.

458
00:22:29.875 --> 00:22:31.166
-Your fault. my fault--
-My fault?

459
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.125
That's not the problem.
You can't go to the provinces without me.

460
00:22:34.208 --> 00:22:36.666
You don't know 'em like I do.
You need someone you can count on.

461
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.458
Oh. so now you know the provinces?

462
00:22:38.541 --> 00:22:40.708
I was born in Bordeaux. Studied in Rennes.

463
00:22:40.791 --> 00:22:43.416
My parents have a chalet in Lyon.
and my uncle's estate is near Aix.

464
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.416
-Yeah. you could say that.
-François. Look at my mouth.

465
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.250
Read my lips. You hear the words?

466
00:22:50.125 --> 00:22:51.333
I'm going. You're not.

467
00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:03.125
Smell that fresh air. huh? Huh?

468
00:23:03.208 --> 00:23:05.833
Look at those mountains.
all the vegetation.

469
00:23:05.916 --> 00:23:08.458
People go across the world
to Réunion Island.

470
00:23:08.541 --> 00:23:09.958
when everything we need's in France.

471
00:23:10.041 --> 00:23:10.875
Réunion is France.

472
00:23:10.958 --> 00:23:12.041
Yeah. sort of.

473
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:14.875
Okay. how long are you gonna sulk?

474
00:23:14.958 --> 00:23:17.375
Three hours on the train
without a word is childish.

475
00:23:17.458 --> 00:23:21.125
-Childish? You called your daddy.
-Daddy? Give me a break.

476
00:23:21.208 --> 00:23:23.125
-I didn't call my daddy.
-Then who'd you call?

477
00:23:23.208 --> 00:23:24.666
-Mommy.
-Right.

478
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.000
She's close with the chief of staff. so--
Anyway. listen. You played. you lost.

479
00:23:28.083 --> 00:23:29.875
-That's it. Move on.
-Nepotism.

480
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.208
-Come again?
-Nepotism.

481
00:23:32.291 --> 00:23:33.916
Nepotism? How dare you say that?

482
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.791
You don't know my life.
You don't know my parents. my journey.

483
00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:39.333
I'm not like you.
I don't have history on my side.

484
00:23:39.416 --> 00:23:41.041
Oh. keep going. This is gonna be good.

485
00:23:41.125 --> 00:23:43.500
Well. when you're white. educated.
and well-connected.

486
00:23:43.583 --> 00:23:45.250
it's not easy
to carve a place for yourself.

487
00:23:45.333 --> 00:23:47.833
-That right?
-Laugh it up. We don't have quotas. sir.

488
00:23:47.916 --> 00:23:49.708
Uh-huh. It's every man for himself.

489
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:52.500
It's so much easier to be Black and poor.
that what you're saying?

490
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:55.041
Hmph.

491
00:23:57.416 --> 00:23:58.458
Did I say that?

492
00:23:59.958 --> 00:24:01.750
Anyway. is someone picking us up?

493
00:24:01.833 --> 00:24:03.750
Alice Gauthier. Deputy Captain.

494
00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:04.750
Alice?

495
00:24:04.833 --> 00:24:06.416
-Yeah.
-There's a name from the '90s.

496
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.125
-Okay?
-So she's 25. 30.

497
00:24:08.208 --> 00:24:09.958
Provincial girls are way less complicated.

498
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:11.500
-Yeah. and?
-Well…

499
00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:13.833
Since you're a little rusty.
this could be your chance.

500
00:24:13.916 --> 00:24:15.333
-You serious?
-Well…

501
00:24:15.416 --> 00:24:16.916
I just don't think about it every day.

502
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.916
You really have a problem.

503
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.583
-You should see a therapist.
-I did. Yesterday. Quite fun.

504
00:24:22.708 --> 00:24:25.416
Well. Alice isn't winning points
for punctuality.

505
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.625
Sorry. I was waiting for you over there.
I got you some coffee. I'm Alice.

506
00:24:28.708 --> 00:24:30.333
-Thanks.
-Alice Gauthier. Nice to meet you.

507
00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:31.416
-Pleasure.
-François Monge.

508
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.125
-In Paris. we do two kisses.
-Oh. we don't do that here.

509
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:37.666
Chief Diakité.
great to be working with you.

510
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.083
-I've heard so much about you.
-Well. great. I have--

511
00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:41.666
I mean. likewise.

512
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.666
-It's a pleasure to meet you too.
-Hmm!

513
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.791
I'm excited already.

514
00:24:45.875 --> 00:24:48.208
-Shall we?
-Sure! Off to Wonderland. Alice.

515
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.583
Just kidding!

516
00:24:51.666 --> 00:24:53.375
-Hmm.
-So. uh. you say something?

517
00:24:53.916 --> 00:24:56.166
-Nope.
-That's what I thought.

518
00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:03.250
-Are you from around here?
-Thonon-les-Bains.

519
00:25:03.333 --> 00:25:04.375
"As-thon-ishing."

520
00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:12.625
Is there any interesting architecture
around here?

521
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.583
Looks like there's
some interesting businesses.

522
00:25:19.958 --> 00:25:23.208
All that's missing is "Napoleon's Bakery"
and "Joan of Arc's Tavern."

523
00:25:23.291 --> 00:25:24.666
BUTCHER - THE THOROUGHBRED

524
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.791
It's a traditional.
patriotic town.

525
00:25:26.875 --> 00:25:27.958
This isn't patriotic.

526
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:33.125
Let me explain. During the past few years.
there's been a lot of drug trafficking.

527
00:25:33.208 --> 00:25:34.458
People just want law and order.

528
00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:36.041
-They wanna preserve our values.
-Hm.

529
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.000
-They just want someone with a firm hand.
-Someone like him?

530
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.541
That fascist from the France Vive party?

531
00:25:44.625 --> 00:25:45.583
OUR CITY. OUR FIGHT

532
00:25:45.666 --> 00:25:48.375
He's on the right.
so you call him a fascist. Why not a Nazi?

533
00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:49.583
Tell me the difference.

534
00:25:49.666 --> 00:25:51.250
For your information.

535
00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:54.708
fascism implies a period in history.
dark and brutal. but not uninteresting…

536
00:25:54.791 --> 00:25:56.166
-Stop it.
-…in economic…

537
00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:59.416
This guy doesn't like Blacks.
Arabs. Jews. or gays.

538
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.833
Europe. Me Too. rap. nothing.
What do you call that?

539
00:26:03.916 --> 00:26:04.958
A patriot.

540
00:26:12.375 --> 00:26:14.833
-Got you!
-Okay. good. That's good. Yeah.

541
00:26:17.333 --> 00:26:18.458
Where do we start?

542
00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:24.708
Oh. hello. there.

543
00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:27.958
I guess you found
his better half. didn't you?

544
00:26:29.583 --> 00:26:32.000
Kevin Marchal. 26. lived with his mother.

545
00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:33.791
Sentenced two years ago
for drug trafficking.

546
00:26:33.875 --> 00:26:35.500
He served eight months.
Nothing after that.

547
00:26:36.541 --> 00:26:38.166
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

548
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.083
Yeah. I'm good. I'm fine.

549
00:26:41.125 --> 00:26:43.500
So he fell off a bridge.
and a train cut him in half?

550
00:26:43.583 --> 00:26:46.458
No. the body was bisected
using a sharp metal object.

551
00:26:46.541 --> 00:26:47.791
Ax? A chainsaw?

552
00:26:47.875 --> 00:26:50.125
No. we're leaning toward
a defective guard rail.

553
00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:53.666
However. that doesn't explain
why the wounds are cauterized like this.

554
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:58.416
Oh. that's crazy. It's seared like bacon.
but it's crispy like barbecue.

555
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.458
We need
the toxicology report.

556
00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:01.416
Wow.

557
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.625
There are two gunshot wounds
from a distance of three and five meters.

558
00:27:04.708 --> 00:27:06.416
Oh. yeah. you can see the entrance wound.

559
00:27:08.541 --> 00:27:11.083
One bullet lodged in bone.

560
00:27:11.833 --> 00:27:13.958
-It's a 7.62.
-Oh. yeah.

561
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:16.541
-Tokarev?
-The dealers' weapon of choice.

562
00:27:18.875 --> 00:27:20.500
What the hell are you doing?

563
00:27:20.583 --> 00:27:23.750
Well. sometimes. when addicts wanna
hide their handiwork--

564
00:27:23.833 --> 00:27:26.125
-That's right.
-Correct me if I'm wrong. doctor.

565
00:27:26.833 --> 00:27:27.875
There's nothing here.

566
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.291
-Stop that!
-That's how I found it.

567
00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:44.083
-You all right?
-Huh? Yeah.

568
00:27:44.583 --> 00:27:46.625
-It's weird. So much space.
-Nice to see you.

569
00:27:46.708 --> 00:27:47.750
That's the country for you.

570
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:48.958
-Hello.
-Good morning.

571
00:27:49.041 --> 00:27:50.000
-I'm fine.
-How are you?

572
00:27:50.083 --> 00:27:51.125
-Morning.
-Morning.

573
00:27:51.208 --> 00:27:53.958
Great crime scene. Perfectly marked.

574
00:27:54.041 --> 00:27:56.791
Protected. No interference.
It's neat. organized.

575
00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:58.791
Good work. No need to envy Paris cops.

576
00:27:58.875 --> 00:28:00.375
We don't envy you!

577
00:28:02.125 --> 00:28:04.083
-Hi. Thanks for meeting us here.
-Morning.

578
00:28:04.916 --> 00:28:06.666
-You wanna go talk to them?
-Why me?

579
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:09.125
We can save time.
I'll debrief with the deputy captain.

580
00:28:09.208 --> 00:28:11.250
-Why not the other way around?
-Just because.

581
00:28:11.333 --> 00:28:12.750
"Just because" isn't good enough.

582
00:28:13.708 --> 00:28:16.833
Well. because I'm a chief.
and you're a captain. Got that?

583
00:28:16.916 --> 00:28:18.125
Hmm.

584
00:28:18.208 --> 00:28:20.583
-Is that an order?
-That's right. It's an order.

585
00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:22.750
-Oh.
-I can do that. I'm your superior.

586
00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:23.916
Hmm.

587
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:31.333
-Gentlemen.
-Hey.

588
00:28:33.875 --> 00:28:36.916
Morning. guys. Captain Monge.
Paris Criminal Division.

589
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.416
Well. Paris. but I'm originally
from the provinces. We're the same.

590
00:28:41.958 --> 00:28:46.375
Man. people talk about climate change.
but weather's fine here!

591
00:28:48.125 --> 00:28:50.916
-Do we have the motorcycle?
-Just his legs.

592
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.791
Then tire tracks. blood and broken glass.

593
00:28:52.875 --> 00:28:54.708
-He hit the rail then fell on the train?
-Right.

594
00:28:54.791 --> 00:28:57.750
-And lost control of his bike there.
-We got a bullet hole here.

595
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.958
-That's why he lost control.
-Mmm.

596
00:29:00.458 --> 00:29:01.583
This is where he was shot.

597
00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:12.916
Two 7.62 rounds.

598
00:29:21.708 --> 00:29:24.083
It fits the traces of blood
we found down the road.

599
00:29:33.958 --> 00:29:37.583
What's weird is that the guy chasing him
stopped right after he shot him.

600
00:29:38.083 --> 00:29:39.166
To finish the job.

601
00:29:46.875 --> 00:29:49.291
Or to cover his tracks.
The motorcycle.

602
00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:54.458
It's too heavy for one guy.

603
00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:04.000
He just forgot one detail.

604
00:30:06.416 --> 00:30:08.125
The 9:52 train to Paris.

605
00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:15.375
-It wasn't the guard rail.
-No. The high-voltage cables.

606
00:30:15.458 --> 00:30:17.458
That's where the burns came from.

607
00:30:18.291 --> 00:30:19.375
I'm coming up.

608
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.625
-What?
-Nothing.

609
00:30:26.708 --> 00:30:27.583
What is it?

610
00:30:28.083 --> 00:30:29.125
Am I wrong?

611
00:30:29.208 --> 00:30:30.208
No. no. you're…

612
00:30:30.708 --> 00:30:31.541
great.

613
00:30:32.333 --> 00:30:33.166
What?

614
00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:36.458
I found a tooth.

615
00:30:36.541 --> 00:30:38.125
I found a tooth.

616
00:30:38.791 --> 00:30:41.208
-He must've lost it on impact.
-He wasn't missing one.

617
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.625
-No?
-Mm-mm.

618
00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:44.958
Oh.

619
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:52.291
Wait. is that the same stick
from the morgue?

620
00:30:53.583 --> 00:30:54.916
Mm-mm. No.

621
00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:58.166
No.

622
00:31:00.125 --> 00:31:01.875
How about we go get some paperwork done?

623
00:31:01.958 --> 00:31:04.458
-Thought we'd visit the victim's mother.
-Ugh! Ugh!

624
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:07.916
-Can we get a car?
-I haven't told her her son's dead yet.

625
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.541
We'll take care of it.

626
00:31:09.625 --> 00:31:12.333
Okay. Sylvain. can you get them a car?

627
00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:13.583
Ugh. Ugh.

628
00:31:14.166 --> 00:31:15.750
-Okay.
-Can I get your digits?

629
00:31:16.416 --> 00:31:17.916
What? My digits?

630
00:31:18.958 --> 00:31:21.500
-For work.
-You sure you don't need my fingerprints?

631
00:31:21.583 --> 00:31:23.000
Just the number's fine.

632
00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:25.250
-Okay. it's 06…
-Right.

633
00:31:25.333 --> 00:31:27.458
-…39. 98…
-Mm-hm.

634
00:31:27.541 --> 00:31:29.250
…32…

635
00:31:29.333 --> 00:31:30.541
…15.

636
00:31:30.625 --> 00:31:32.541
-Call me any time.
-Okay.

637
00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:33.875
Mine is 06…

638
00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:36.333
No. it's fine. You're always together. so…

639
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.833
-Okay. See you.
-See you.

640
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.083
Hmm.

641
00:31:45.666 --> 00:31:48.166
-Mmm. I don't like her.
-What?

642
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.083
No. there' something's off about her.

643
00:31:50.166 --> 00:31:51.791
Because she digs me and not you?

644
00:31:51.875 --> 00:31:53.375
Is that it?

645
00:31:53.458 --> 00:31:54.625
Yeah. of course.

646
00:31:55.208 --> 00:31:57.166
-Here's the keys.
-Thanks. Sylvain. Appreciate it.

647
00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.250
Unreal.

648
00:31:59.333 --> 00:32:01.125
-You're jealous.
-Of what?

649
00:32:01.208 --> 00:32:02.958
-This.
-Jealous of what?

650
00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:04.791
-Of this.
-You wish.

651
00:32:05.958 --> 00:32:07.541
-No.
-So jealous.

652
00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:09.291
-Mm.
-What is it. then?

653
00:32:09.375 --> 00:32:10.750
-Well…
-Say it.

654
00:32:10.833 --> 00:32:12.750
-You don't have an excuse!
-I'm 37.

655
00:32:12.833 --> 00:32:15.333
I'm too old for this nonsense.

656
00:32:22.291 --> 00:32:24.541
-What are you doin'?
-Putting on my gun.

657
00:32:24.625 --> 00:32:27.791
No. You'll just scare her.
In the glove box.

658
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.333
-This isn't protocol.
-Here.

659
00:32:31.458 --> 00:32:33.500
-It's fine.
-Yeah. but it's not protocol.

660
00:32:35.541 --> 00:32:37.333
Also. go easy with the news.

661
00:32:37.416 --> 00:32:39.166
Come on. I can be sensitive.

662
00:32:43.291 --> 00:32:46.250
Afternoon. ma'am. Captain Diakité.
Paris Criminal Division.

663
00:32:46.333 --> 00:32:49.083
-This is Lieutenant Monge.
-Also from the Criminal Division.

664
00:32:49.166 --> 00:32:50.500
No. you're not.

665
00:32:50.583 --> 00:32:52.416
But this way. we don't have to explain.

666
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.500
-Sorry. what's this about?
-Can we come in for a minute?

667
00:32:56.416 --> 00:32:57.958
-Okay.
-Thank you.

668
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.333
-What are you doing?
-What are you?

669
00:33:00.416 --> 00:33:01.625
-I'm goin' inside.
-So am I.

670
00:33:01.708 --> 00:33:03.041
-Come on. back up.
-Why me?

671
00:33:03.125 --> 00:33:04.166
-Because.
-Whatever.

672
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.666
-Aww. thanks so much.
-Fine.

673
00:33:08.166 --> 00:33:09.791
Do you mind if I use
your restroom. please?

674
00:33:09.875 --> 00:33:11.958
-Yes. It's right there.
-Thank you.

675
00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:12.875
Oh…

676
00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:15.583
In the meantime.
we can chat in the living room.

677
00:33:18.666 --> 00:33:20.333
Oh…

678
00:33:20.416 --> 00:33:22.291
Come on.

679
00:33:22.375 --> 00:33:23.833
Have a seat.

680
00:33:23.916 --> 00:33:25.750
-Oh.
-Animals. Uh…

681
00:33:27.625 --> 00:33:29.333
Okay. um. Mrs. Marchal…

682
00:33:29.416 --> 00:33:32.166
-I have good news and bad news.
-You found my son. didn't you?

683
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.791
-Well. yes. That's the good news.
-And he's okay?

684
00:33:36.958 --> 00:33:39.833
Well. okay. actually.
I shouldn't have started like that.

685
00:33:43.541 --> 00:33:44.875
-Um…
-Is he hurt?

686
00:33:44.958 --> 00:33:46.708
He was shot twice in the leg. but--

687
00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.208
Oh my God. Can he still walk?

688
00:33:48.291 --> 00:33:50.708
-No. He can't walk anymore.
-How did--

689
00:33:50.791 --> 00:33:52.583
-But there's a detail--
-Oh…

690
00:34:11.041 --> 00:34:14.416
-Please tell me he's all right.
-You're not helping. Mrs. Marchal.

691
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.208
Okay. like a chest wax.
Just rip it off in one go.

692
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.041
Um. Kevin is dead. ma'am. I'm sorry.

693
00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:22.583
-No.
-I'm sorry.

694
00:34:22.666 --> 00:34:25.291
No! No!

695
00:34:29.041 --> 00:34:30.750
-No!
-Sorry.

696
00:34:31.458 --> 00:34:32.833
No!

697
00:34:32.916 --> 00:34:33.875
-No! No!
-Yeah…

698
00:34:33.958 --> 00:34:34.833
-Please. no!
-Yes!

699
00:34:34.916 --> 00:34:37.000
-No! No!
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

700
00:34:37.083 --> 00:34:39.958
-Oh. no!
-Shh. Calm down. Ow!

701
00:34:40.541 --> 00:34:42.375
-Shh. it's okay.
-What the hell did you do?

702
00:34:42.458 --> 00:34:43.541
Get a paper bag.

703
00:34:43.625 --> 00:34:45.916
She's hyperventilating.
Breathe through your nose.

704
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.458
Breathe. Shh!

705
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.041
-No! No!
-What's that?

706
00:34:53.125 --> 00:34:54.333
Stupid!

707
00:34:57.541 --> 00:34:58.375
Gross.

708
00:34:58.458 --> 00:35:00.333
Shh. Deep breaths. Come on.

709
00:35:00.416 --> 00:35:02.458
Okay. do it. Just keep breathing. Here.

710
00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:03.916
Breathe into the bag.

711
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.166
There you go.

712
00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:09.000
We'll do everything in our power
to find out who did this. okay?

713
00:35:10.583 --> 00:35:12.500
Oh. it smells just like him.

714
00:35:13.125 --> 00:35:15.375
Oh! He was a good boy.

715
00:35:15.458 --> 00:35:18.958
but he was always hanging out
with the wrong people.

716
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:20.625
Quit it!

717
00:35:21.833 --> 00:35:22.791
Who. for instance?

718
00:35:23.916 --> 00:35:26.708
There was his… his friend. Nader.

719
00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:28.041
The Snitch.

720
00:35:28.125 --> 00:35:29.750
It'll be okay.

721
00:35:29.833 --> 00:35:31.250
No!

722
00:35:31.333 --> 00:35:33.541
It's okay. ma'am. We understand.

723
00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:37.166
What did Kevin do? Did he work?

724
00:35:38.625 --> 00:35:41.791
He used to work at the pharmacy.
but… but he got fired.

725
00:35:41.875 --> 00:35:43.791
They accused him of stealing medication

726
00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:47.416
and having people buy it from him
on the street.

727
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.791
That's when he started
spending his days in his workshop.

728
00:35:51.875 --> 00:35:53.541
-That's what he called it.
-Mm-hm.

729
00:35:53.625 --> 00:35:55.750
-I don't know what he was doing. but…
-Let go.

730
00:35:55.833 --> 00:35:57.750
-At least he was here.
-Mm-hm.

731
00:35:57.833 --> 00:36:00.333
-With me.
-Okay.

732
00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:02.541
He was with me!

733
00:36:02.625 --> 00:36:04.458
-I know.
-Shh. It's okay.

734
00:36:05.541 --> 00:36:07.375
-It's okay.
-Let it out.

735
00:36:10.583 --> 00:36:11.583
I know.

736
00:36:12.208 --> 00:36:14.041
I know. Okay. okay. okay.

737
00:36:15.666 --> 00:36:17.500
-Ow! My pinkie.
-Shut up!

738
00:36:17.583 --> 00:36:18.708
Ow!

739
00:36:18.791 --> 00:36:20.041
There you go.

740
00:36:27.125 --> 00:36:28.916
This is nice. huh? Yeah.

741
00:36:32.958 --> 00:36:36.250
Okay. well. it's slippery.
Pig and chicken shit.

742
00:36:39.291 --> 00:36:40.625
Hey!

743
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:44.333
It's back there.

744
00:36:44.416 --> 00:36:46.958
Careful around the dogs.
They can be a little frisky.

745
00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:50.791
Take a hike!

746
00:36:51.708 --> 00:36:53.166
Hey. Sh!

747
00:36:53.875 --> 00:36:55.791
Man. I don't think
I ever got a rabies shot.

748
00:36:55.875 --> 00:36:57.541
Come on! Look at the little guys.

749
00:37:00.958 --> 00:37:04.125
See. they're fine. For real. Right?

750
00:37:04.708 --> 00:37:06.041
Huh? Look.

751
00:37:06.125 --> 00:37:07.458
What a good boy.

752
00:37:07.541 --> 00:37:09.000
Oh shit!

753
00:37:10.083 --> 00:37:11.541
They're out of control!

754
00:37:19.458 --> 00:37:21.916
What the hell?
Do you think they're bipolar?

755
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.458
I know some bears are bipolar.

756
00:37:25.625 --> 00:37:27.250
-Was Kevin training them to fight?
-No.

757
00:37:27.333 --> 00:37:29.125
I don't think they ever left the house.

758
00:37:29.208 --> 00:37:30.916
-I gotta get keys.
-Hang on.

759
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.541
No need.

760
00:37:36.166 --> 00:37:38.083
A nice little lab.

761
00:37:38.166 --> 00:37:41.583
-No kidding. A budding chemist.
-Not bad. Kevin.

762
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.750
Pretty nice. my man.

763
00:37:43.833 --> 00:37:45.791
-What is this?
-Very organized.

764
00:37:45.875 --> 00:37:48.000
Okay.

765
00:37:49.583 --> 00:37:51.666
-Nasal decongestant.
-Hell of a cold.

766
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:55.125
They use this to make methamphetamine.
See these crystals here?

767
00:37:56.333 --> 00:37:58.000
You studied chemistry?

768
00:37:58.083 --> 00:37:59.458
I've studied Breaking Bad.

769
00:37:59.541 --> 00:38:00.375
Coke.

770
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:05.083
-Oxycodone.
-Hang on. Don't move.

771
00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:06.375
What are you doing?

772
00:38:06.958 --> 00:38:09.583
Sending it to a friend
in Narcotics.

773
00:38:09.666 --> 00:38:12.666
Yasmine… You two still talk?

774
00:38:14.208 --> 00:38:15.458
Why? What do you care?

775
00:38:15.541 --> 00:38:17.583
Oh. okay. You're not mad at her?

776
00:38:17.666 --> 00:38:19.125
Dude. I'm not mad at you.

777
00:38:19.208 --> 00:38:22.083
-Quit bugging me about that.
-Right. Nice double standard.

778
00:38:24.208 --> 00:38:26.625
Man. you could
kill a horse with this much.

779
00:38:26.708 --> 00:38:28.750
-Shit. The dogs.
-What about them?

780
00:38:29.583 --> 00:38:31.916
He tested product on them.
They're guinea pigs.

781
00:38:33.375 --> 00:38:35.166
-Mrs. Marchal?
-Yes?

782
00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:38.333
Can you tell us anything
about the people your son hung out with?

783
00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:40.583
Well. there was this girl. Jessica.

784
00:38:41.916 --> 00:38:44.541
He went to see her sometimes.
I think she works at a bar.

785
00:38:45.541 --> 00:38:46.375
Hold on.

786
00:38:47.041 --> 00:38:48.666
Is it by chance this bar?

787
00:38:49.666 --> 00:38:50.833
That's the one.

788
00:39:04.458 --> 00:39:05.541
Ah!

789
00:39:06.416 --> 00:39:07.833
-Strip.
-Yeah.

790
00:39:07.916 --> 00:39:09.125
Mmm.

791
00:39:09.208 --> 00:39:11.125
That means we might see naked women.

792
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:14.375
-And?
-No. nothing. You've been warned.

793
00:39:15.458 --> 00:39:16.708
You're a dick.

794
00:39:17.541 --> 00:39:20.208
-You got a hanky?
-Why do you need a hanky?

795
00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:22.916
-You're sweating.
-Stop talking.

796
00:39:26.833 --> 00:39:28.166
-Hello.
-Miss.

797
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.250
We're not open yet.

798
00:39:30.708 --> 00:39:31.916
You are now.

799
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.708
We need to speak with Jessica.

800
00:39:39.125 --> 00:39:41.583
-Which way are the dressing rooms?
-Um…

801
00:39:41.666 --> 00:39:43.000
-Down there.
-Thank you.

802
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:44.666
Okay. I'm going.

803
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.625
-To the dressing rooms?
-Yeah.

804
00:39:48.458 --> 00:39:49.583
You sure?

805
00:39:50.333 --> 00:39:51.333
You're a dickhead.

806
00:39:51.416 --> 00:39:52.416
Mmm.

807
00:40:01.916 --> 00:40:02.750
Excuse me.

808
00:40:04.208 --> 00:40:05.041
Well. hi.

809
00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:07.916
And you are?

810
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.708
Uh… Yeah. Police.

811
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:13.708
One moment.

812
00:40:16.833 --> 00:40:17.958
François. François.

813
00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:20.333
Um…

814
00:40:22.291 --> 00:40:23.291
You should go.

815
00:40:23.791 --> 00:40:25.333
-Why?
-It's better this way.

816
00:40:25.833 --> 00:40:28.041
Well… Oh!

817
00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:29.291
-You have issues.
-What?

818
00:40:29.375 --> 00:40:30.916
-Very sad.
-What? Hey--

819
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.208
-You have issues with women.
-What does that mean? Go.

820
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.291
-Jessica?
-Hm?

821
00:40:38.041 --> 00:40:40.083
Captain Monge. Paris Criminal Division.

822
00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:43.125
-What is this? A parade?
-I wanna talk about Kevin Marchal.

823
00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:45.083
-Is he okay?
-No. he's dead.

824
00:40:46.166 --> 00:40:47.125
He was murdered.

825
00:40:49.666 --> 00:40:51.208
I knew this wouldn't end well.

826
00:40:54.416 --> 00:40:55.250
Rub my back?

827
00:40:57.208 --> 00:40:58.333
As you wish.

828
00:40:59.625 --> 00:41:00.750
No problem.

829
00:41:09.416 --> 00:41:10.250
That okay?

830
00:41:10.333 --> 00:41:12.291
-I mean. my hands aren't too cold?
-No.

831
00:41:12.375 --> 00:41:13.416
No.

832
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.583
Okay. now you answer.

833
00:41:15.541 --> 00:41:16.958
Come on. let's not make this boring.

834
00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:19.750
Here's how it works.
I ask you questions. and you answer.

835
00:41:20.458 --> 00:41:22.083
You remind me of this joke. bro.

836
00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:24.500
Aah! He speaks!
And he called me bro.

837
00:41:24.583 --> 00:41:26.916
-I'd say that's progress.
-It's about a…

838
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.375
What do you call. um…

839
00:41:30.208 --> 00:41:31.125
A man of color.

840
00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:33.125
Can't wait to hear this.

841
00:41:33.208 --> 00:41:35.458
He walks into a bar
with a parrot on his shoulder.

842
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:38.041
The bartender sees him.
says. "Wow! He's beautiful!"

843
00:41:38.125 --> 00:41:39.375
"Where did you get him?"

844
00:41:41.041 --> 00:41:42.166
Okay? Where'd he get him?

845
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.375
The parrot answers. "In Africa."

846
00:41:45.583 --> 00:41:47.916
In Africa!

847
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.541
In Africa? Aah!

848
00:41:49.625 --> 00:41:51.625
-'Cause the parrot says it.
-Right!

849
00:41:51.708 --> 00:41:54.166
Wow. that's a good one.
Well. it's racist. but it's a good one.

850
00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:55.750
-Racist towards who?
-Black people.

851
00:41:55.833 --> 00:41:57.500
-Oh. come on.
-Un poquito.

852
00:41:57.583 --> 00:42:01.208
Sorry. shouldn't speak Spanish.
Don't wanna provoke you. But it's racist.

853
00:42:01.291 --> 00:42:02.500
So. Kevin Marchal.

854
00:42:02.583 --> 00:42:05.250
I don't talk
to Sub-Saharan immigrants. Sorry.

855
00:42:06.083 --> 00:42:08.625
And I usually don't talk
to racist sons of bitches.

856
00:42:08.708 --> 00:42:11.375
But let's both give it a shot. okay?
You got that. partner?

857
00:42:12.833 --> 00:42:14.208
Oh! Guess it's my turn.

858
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.833
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

859
00:42:17.791 --> 00:42:19.500
I just cleaned in here!

860
00:42:19.583 --> 00:42:20.708
Oh. no. No!

861
00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:31.791
I mean. it was fun at first.

862
00:42:32.375 --> 00:42:34.208
Despite his wild side. he was a sweet guy.

863
00:42:34.291 --> 00:42:35.250
Sure.

864
00:42:35.333 --> 00:42:37.291
But that stuff he was making…

865
00:42:39.958 --> 00:42:41.958
-Sorry. So he was dealing?
-He used to.

866
00:42:42.041 --> 00:42:43.833
-With his buddy. the Snitch.
-Who's he?

867
00:42:44.458 --> 00:42:45.291
Nader.

868
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.541
They call him the Snitch.

869
00:42:50.333 --> 00:42:52.416
He works at the laser tag place
at the mall.

870
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.541
They got in a fight when he found out
Kevin was making his own drugs.

871
00:42:55.625 --> 00:42:57.125
They were doing pretty good business.

872
00:42:58.375 --> 00:43:00.500
-François] Uh-huh?
-They'd deal in nightclubs.

873
00:43:01.375 --> 00:43:02.208
In raves.

874
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:06.833
You don't have to do my butt.

875
00:43:10.541 --> 00:43:11.375
Okay.

876
00:43:11.458 --> 00:43:12.583
-Thanks.
-You're very welcome.

877
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.125
Come on. Come on!

878
00:43:29.083 --> 00:43:31.625
We met up. like. two weeks ago.

879
00:43:31.708 --> 00:43:35.083
He was really nervous. like he…
was spooked about something.

880
00:43:35.666 --> 00:43:37.041
-I don't know.
-François!

881
00:43:37.125 --> 00:43:38.416
François!

882
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.625
And that guy gets chief.

883
00:43:58.666 --> 00:44:00.458
God damn!

884
00:44:00.541 --> 00:44:03.208
Damn! Hey. this guy's nuts.
He's fucking crazy.

885
00:44:03.291 --> 00:44:06.333
I'll show you. This ain't over.
This ain't over!

886
00:44:06.833 --> 00:44:08.250
Damn it. Coming!

887
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.166
Idiot…

888
00:44:21.166 --> 00:44:23.291
There's a reason
this is against fucking protocol.

889
00:44:27.083 --> 00:44:28.791
Oh shit!

890
00:44:28.875 --> 00:44:30.875
Fuck! Aah! Shit!

891
00:44:30.958 --> 00:44:33.708
Oh. come on. come on. come on!

892
00:44:34.541 --> 00:44:35.375
No!

893
00:44:37.333 --> 00:44:39.333
Oh. fuck!

894
00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:55.791
Fuck!

895
00:44:58.291 --> 00:44:59.125
Shit!

896
00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:29.041
First warning! Hands on your head!

897
00:45:40.375 --> 00:45:41.791
Hey…

898
00:45:41.875 --> 00:45:43.291
Uh… Uh…

899
00:45:43.375 --> 00:45:44.916
This is your second warning?

900
00:45:50.833 --> 00:45:52.333
What the fuck?

901
00:46:19.375 --> 00:46:20.208
He's dead.

902
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:33.500
Weird. No pain. didn't tire.

903
00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:35.666
The guy was on drugs.

904
00:46:36.833 --> 00:46:38.875
Yeah. sure.

905
00:46:39.458 --> 00:46:40.625
What do you mean. "sure"?

906
00:46:40.708 --> 00:46:44.333
Listen. Ousmane. You got your ass kicked.
You don't have to make excuses.

907
00:46:45.208 --> 00:46:48.041
All because of a joke.
It was tasteless. I'll give you that--

908
00:46:48.125 --> 00:46:49.416
No. it wasn't tasteless.

909
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.666
-It was racist. Not the same.
-Oh! In the original. it's a monkey.

910
00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:55.208
I think you're being overly sens--

911
00:46:57.166 --> 00:46:58.208
You were saying?

912
00:46:58.291 --> 00:47:00.083
GET OUT. NEGROES AND HOMOS

913
00:47:00.166 --> 00:47:01.416
Am I still too sensitive?

914
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.250
God! What a shitty town. Damn!

915
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.458
Look at this. They even broke the window!

916
00:47:08.541 --> 00:47:10.041
The window? Come on. guys…

917
00:47:10.125 --> 00:47:12.583
Why do people do this?
Seriously. Why break the window?

918
00:47:12.666 --> 00:47:15.291
And I understand the N-word.
but "homos"? Really?

919
00:47:15.375 --> 00:47:17.333
-What was that?
-Come again?

920
00:47:17.416 --> 00:47:19.750
-I heard you. I want an explanation.
-You don't understand.

921
00:47:19.833 --> 00:47:22.333
No. I don't. Give me the keys. please.

922
00:47:22.416 --> 00:47:23.750
Oh shit. uh…

923
00:47:25.708 --> 00:47:27.833
I… I strategically placed them
under the car.

924
00:47:28.416 --> 00:47:30.416
-You left the keys under the car?
-Yes!

925
00:47:37.166 --> 00:47:40.458
Carl Müller. License revoked
two years ago. Nothing too egregious.

926
00:47:40.541 --> 00:47:43.041
He worked for a security company.
Securitec.

927
00:47:43.125 --> 00:47:45.583
-Guess we should pay them a visit.
-Hmm.

928
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:49.125
He had this tattooed on his neck.
Mean something to you?

929
00:47:49.208 --> 00:47:52.000
-No.
-If it isn't our friends from the capital!

930
00:47:52.083 --> 00:47:53.791
How are you? I'm Chief Mercier.

931
00:47:53.875 --> 00:47:55.375
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Pleasure's mine.

932
00:47:55.458 --> 00:47:58.791
We're waiting for the autopsy.
Hopefully. it confirms cardiac arrest.

933
00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:01.833
-Or was it self-defense?
-I was attacked.

934
00:48:01.916 --> 00:48:02.958
Verbally and physically.

935
00:48:03.041 --> 00:48:05.250
-What more do you need?
-The guy was kinda tough.

936
00:48:05.333 --> 00:48:07.416
No. the guy was on drugs.

937
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.083
Reminds me of a kid I saw at a rave.

938
00:48:09.166 --> 00:48:12.041
He had a bad trip on laced ecstasy.
Took three guys to stop him.

939
00:48:12.125 --> 00:48:14.583
Let's compare Carl's results
with the stuff we found at Kevin's.

940
00:48:14.666 --> 00:48:17.916
Two dead bodies in two days
is way above our average.

941
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.500
I need you to stop the body count.

942
00:48:19.583 --> 00:48:22.833
and wrap this up quickly.
quietly and with a sure hand. hm?

943
00:48:22.916 --> 00:48:27.166
-That sounds like us. I do quiet jobs.
-And he does hand jobs? Not surprised.

944
00:48:28.583 --> 00:48:30.708
Gauthier. stick to procedure.
Record everything.

945
00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:34.125
Of course. boss. Sometimes.
he mixes up captain and secretary.

946
00:48:34.208 --> 00:48:35.625
-I have that problem.
-That right?

947
00:48:35.708 --> 00:48:38.708
Some people think a captain works under
the chief. We're more like co-chiefs.

948
00:48:38.791 --> 00:48:39.875
Hmm.

949
00:48:39.958 --> 00:48:43.666
Oh! Kevin's tests.
Traces of cocaine and cannabis. Uh…

950
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:45.666
Just like most of the kids here.

951
00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.166
He's not a dealer or addict. He's a cook.

952
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:52.041
Speaking of cooks. are you hungry?
We've done enough for one day.

953
00:48:52.125 --> 00:48:53.250
What's the local specialty?

954
00:48:54.708 --> 00:48:55.541
Hm.

955
00:48:55.625 --> 00:48:58.333
Mmm!

956
00:48:58.916 --> 00:49:00.208
-Mmm.
-Mmm!

957
00:49:00.291 --> 00:49:01.500
-Mmm. Delicious.
-Mm-hm?

958
00:49:01.583 --> 00:49:03.125
-Mmm! It's tasty.
-Mm.

959
00:49:03.208 --> 00:49:05.416
You can't go back
without trying our croissoufflé.

960
00:49:05.916 --> 00:49:08.333
And crunchy. mmm.
but it melts in your mouth.

961
00:49:08.416 --> 00:49:10.000
Mmm. mmm. So good!

962
00:49:10.875 --> 00:49:12.500
-Mmm.
-God. I'm just pigging out.

963
00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:17.291
I was worried that tripe. pasta
and Raclette cheese would be too heavy.

964
00:49:17.375 --> 00:49:18.583
But it's not at all.

965
00:49:18.666 --> 00:49:21.166
-That's right.
-Not at all. You wanna know why?

966
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:24.291
They don't use heavy cream.
They use yog-urt.

967
00:49:25.458 --> 00:49:26.375
What?

968
00:49:27.083 --> 00:49:29.333
-It's yog-urt.
-Yoh-gurt!

969
00:49:30.291 --> 00:49:32.500
-Yogurt.
-No "yog-urt." Oh. Oh. "Yoh-gurt."

970
00:49:32.583 --> 00:49:34.875
-But the "O" is silent. Yog-urt.
-No. Yoh-gurt.

971
00:49:34.958 --> 00:49:37.291
-I've always said yog-urt. How about you?
-Uh. yoh-gurt.

972
00:49:37.375 --> 00:49:38.375
-Really?
-See. told you.

973
00:49:38.458 --> 00:49:41.458
-I've always said yog-urt.
-How about "sp-yoon" while you're at it?

974
00:49:41.541 --> 00:49:44.291
-I'm sure both are correct.
-Where'd you learn that?

975
00:49:44.791 --> 00:49:47.250
At "sch-yool"?
Where you wrote on the "wh-yite board"?

976
00:49:47.333 --> 00:49:49.666
-Whatever.
-There are no "ryules" for the table.

977
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:52.958
-I'm afraid we must "gyo."
-Perhaps I should "cyall you a cyarriage."

978
00:49:53.041 --> 00:49:55.166
All right! Are you done yet?

979
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:57.166
Alice? May I call you that?

980
00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.458
Of course you can.

981
00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:00.750
Tell me. Alice…

982
00:50:00.833 --> 00:50:02.708
-Hmm?
-Excuse me.

983
00:50:04.166 --> 00:50:05.750
-What's a girl like you--
-Excuse me.

984
00:50:08.791 --> 00:50:09.916
…doing in this line of work?

985
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.875
What do you mean. a girl like me?

986
00:50:11.958 --> 00:50:14.208
-Well--
-Means you're hot.

987
00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:15.416
Sorry?

988
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:18.166
Come on. we don't need to sugar-coat it.

989
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:21.625
Alice is a ravishing young woman.
Pointing it out isn't a crime.

990
00:50:21.708 --> 00:50:23.500
You're being a creep.

991
00:50:24.416 --> 00:50:25.416
The Veile family!

992
00:50:26.083 --> 00:50:27.750
-How are you doing? Hello.
-Mr. Mayor.

993
00:50:27.833 --> 00:50:28.791
-Hey.
-How are you?

994
00:50:28.875 --> 00:50:30.291
-Hey. good evening.
-How are you?

995
00:50:30.375 --> 00:50:31.541
I'm great.

996
00:50:32.375 --> 00:50:34.041
-Hmm.
-Peter! How's it going?

997
00:50:34.125 --> 00:50:35.791
-How's business?
-Isn't that the mayor?

998
00:50:35.875 --> 00:50:37.958
-It's his second home.
-I'll stop in soon.

999
00:50:38.041 --> 00:50:40.458
Literally. He owns the restaurant
and a bunch of other places.

1000
00:50:40.541 --> 00:50:42.416
Right. I get it. Brunner City. huh?

1001
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.250
When the local economy crashed.
he bought everything

1002
00:50:45.333 --> 00:50:48.750
and created thousands of jobs.
so. of course. when he ran for mayor…

1003
00:50:49.625 --> 00:50:51.083
Ms. Deputy Captain.

1004
00:50:51.583 --> 00:50:53.166
-Mr. Mayor. Hi.
-Good evening.

1005
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.833
-Pleasure to meet--
-Ah. don't get up.

1006
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.333
-You're both from Paris. aren't you?
-Yeah.

1007
00:50:59.416 --> 00:51:01.166
You're here about the death
of Kevin Marchal?

1008
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:04.166
-News travels fast.
-Poor kid. It's terrible.

1009
00:51:04.833 --> 00:51:07.166
Terrible. You know.
that's why I work so hard.

1010
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:10.541
So young people can thrive here.
away from violence and the drug trade.

1011
00:51:10.625 --> 00:51:13.166
Anyway. I hope
you find the culprit quickly

1012
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:15.291
and that it won't keep you
from enjoying our town.

1013
00:51:15.375 --> 00:51:17.458
-I see you're off to a nice start.
-Yeah.

1014
00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:22.250
To accompany this meal. I'd recommend
a glass of Chartreuse. It's made in house.

1015
00:51:22.333 --> 00:51:24.041
Mickael? Three.

1016
00:51:25.708 --> 00:51:28.166
-Have you been here before?
-No. but we feel at home.

1017
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:30.750
It's clean. And welcoming.

1018
00:51:31.333 --> 00:51:34.958
I actually came here
a while ago with my grandma.

1019
00:51:35.041 --> 00:51:37.458
We were visiting one of the resorts.

1020
00:51:37.541 --> 00:51:40.916
It was a magical place. What?
Their spa was absolutely exquisite.

1021
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.750
Yeah. Don't care.

1022
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:44.250
Excuse him.

1023
00:51:44.958 --> 00:51:47.333
-I hope you enjoy your evening.
-Thanks.

1024
00:51:47.416 --> 00:51:48.541
-Thanks.
-Bye. now.

1025
00:51:48.625 --> 00:51:49.750
-Thanks. Mr. Mayor.
-Bye.

1026
00:51:50.791 --> 00:51:53.791
Hey. isn't that nice?
The mayor coming to the restaurant…

1027
00:51:53.875 --> 00:51:55.875
-Oh. right. Thanks. Mickael.
-Thanks.

1028
00:51:55.958 --> 00:51:58.958
So one drink. a pat on the back.
and you're sold.

1029
00:51:59.041 --> 00:52:00.375
You'd vote for Hitler.

1030
00:52:00.458 --> 00:52:02.791
Well. to your
coalition with the provinces.

1031
00:52:02.875 --> 00:52:04.625
-Cheers.
-Mmm.

1032
00:52:08.958 --> 00:52:10.125
Tastes like goat piss.

1033
00:52:16.583 --> 00:52:17.416
I'm sorry.

1034
00:52:18.791 --> 00:52:21.500
-I ate way too much.
-Ever heard of self-restraint?

1035
00:52:22.291 --> 00:52:25.000
It's not me. it's the cookie
that came with the coffee.

1036
00:52:25.083 --> 00:52:26.416
Cinnamon makes me bloated.

1037
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:27.375
Here we are.

1038
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:29.291
Hmm.

1039
00:52:30.916 --> 00:52:32.708
-You're joking?
-Sorry. We're on a budget.

1040
00:52:34.833 --> 00:52:36.750
-It's perfect. Thanks.
-Mm-hm.

1041
00:52:37.875 --> 00:52:39.916
And thanks for tonight. It was great.

1042
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.083
Hmm.

1043
00:52:42.333 --> 00:52:43.500
It's all great.

1044
00:52:43.583 --> 00:52:45.041
Mmm.

1045
00:52:48.875 --> 00:52:50.958
-Oh. sure. I'll get your bag.
-Good night.

1046
00:52:51.041 --> 00:52:52.000
Good night.

1047
00:52:57.708 --> 00:52:59.125
I'm tired. Come on.

1048
00:52:59.208 --> 00:53:00.833
-Okay. Dad. All right.
-Come on!

1049
00:53:01.416 --> 00:53:03.333
-See you.
-Yeah. have a good night.

1050
00:53:08.625 --> 00:53:09.458
No. after you.

1051
00:53:09.541 --> 00:53:10.750
-No. go ahead.
-Go ahead.

1052
00:53:12.333 --> 00:53:14.083
-You said. "go ahead."
-No. you did.

1053
00:53:14.166 --> 00:53:15.666
It's fine. Go on.

1054
00:53:17.416 --> 00:53:19.625
You're kidding me.

1055
00:53:24.083 --> 00:53:25.791
Can I help you?

1056
00:53:25.875 --> 00:53:29.041
-We have two rooms. Diakité and Monge.
-Diaki…

1057
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.666
-…té.
-Uh-huh.

1058
00:53:34.041 --> 00:53:36.000
Oh. yeah. One queen.

1059
00:53:36.083 --> 00:53:37.875
No. No. there's two of us.

1060
00:53:37.958 --> 00:53:39.916
-So. two rooms.
-Hm.

1061
00:53:40.583 --> 00:53:42.875
No. this says one room for two people.

1062
00:53:42.958 --> 00:53:45.416
Fine. Forget it.
Give me my own room. please. I'll pay.

1063
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:46.958
We're all booked up. sorry.

1064
00:53:48.041 --> 00:53:50.250
Totally full
'cause of the conference. It's…

1065
00:53:50.333 --> 00:53:52.166
totally… full.

1066
00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:54.083
It's fine.

1067
00:53:59.416 --> 00:54:01.041
Really?

1068
00:54:01.125 --> 00:54:02.500
Right. Of course.

1069
00:54:02.583 --> 00:54:04.708
I call the window side.

1070
00:54:06.916 --> 00:54:09.333
{\an8}If populism means
listening to your fellow citizens

1071
00:54:09.416 --> 00:54:13.666
{\an8}and trying to improve their lives.
then yes. I am a populist.

1072
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:14.791
{\an8}And proud of it.

1073
00:54:14.875 --> 00:54:18.000
What kind of message are we sending
these unfortunate people?

1074
00:54:18.083 --> 00:54:21.500
{\an8}"Come to our country.
We'll provide for you." It's fiction!

1075
00:54:21.583 --> 00:54:25.375
{\an8}All that's waiting
is poverty and deprivation.

1076
00:54:25.458 --> 00:54:29.458
It's time to stop dangling carrots
and to stop making promises we can't keep.

1077
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:39.708
What you doin'?

1078
00:54:40.625 --> 00:54:42.708
Oh. my bad. Sorry. Forgot you were there.

1079
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:46.583
Excuse me.

1080
00:54:56.833 --> 00:54:58.833
-There. Happy?
-Do I look happy?

1081
00:55:00.291 --> 00:55:03.250
You think I'm gonna sleep next to you
like that? Hell. no.

1082
00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:04.916
-Why not?
-Because.

1083
00:55:05.416 --> 00:55:07.000
-Because why?
-Just because.

1084
00:55:07.083 --> 00:55:09.041
-Of course. "just because."
-Damn straight.

1085
00:55:09.125 --> 00:55:11.208
Well. I can't sleep unless I'm naked.

1086
00:55:11.291 --> 00:55:12.541
Look. I even left my T-shirt on.

1087
00:55:12.625 --> 00:55:15.375
The T-shirt is not the problem.
Your balls are out!

1088
00:55:15.458 --> 00:55:17.541
Like a white Winnie-the-Pooh.

1089
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.666
What's going on with you? Are you afraid?

1090
00:55:23.708 --> 00:55:27.500
Afraid that I'll awaken
some hidden desire or something?

1091
00:55:27.583 --> 00:55:30.833
You got me. Now go pick up your briefs
and put 'em on.

1092
00:55:31.458 --> 00:55:32.791
I'd appreciate it.

1093
00:55:32.875 --> 00:55:36.250
You need to get more comfortable
with the human body.

1094
00:55:36.333 --> 00:55:37.750
My body is fine.

1095
00:55:37.833 --> 00:55:39.666
It's your naked ass
I don't want next to me.

1096
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:41.375
Yeah. you're not a prude at all…

1097
00:55:44.083 --> 00:55:45.083
There we go.

1098
00:55:45.166 --> 00:55:46.791
-We okay now?
-Yeah. We're good.

1099
00:55:46.875 --> 00:55:49.166
-Okay. all right. Good night.
-All right. good night.

1100
00:56:03.625 --> 00:56:04.458
François.

1101
00:56:13.666 --> 00:56:14.750
Nasty.

1102
00:56:20.583 --> 00:56:22.916
Looks like the local
security business is booming.

1103
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.500
-Are you sulking?
-No.

1104
00:56:24.583 --> 00:56:25.708
What's the matter?

1105
00:56:25.791 --> 00:56:27.916
You should've had breakfast.
They had smoked sausage.

1106
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.208
-I'm fine.
-Gives you energy.

1107
00:56:29.291 --> 00:56:30.791
Sleep gives me energy.

1108
00:56:31.875 --> 00:56:34.125
Your nose makes a weird noise
when you sleep.

1109
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:35.833
See a doctor. sniffy.

1110
00:56:35.916 --> 00:56:37.958
-My nose is perfect. Runs in the family.
-Hmm.

1111
00:56:38.041 --> 00:56:40.916
We got Carl's results.
Amphetamines and steroids.

1112
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.666
-Just like Kevin.
-Told you. The guy was on drugs.

1113
00:56:44.833 --> 00:56:46.208
And he beat your ass.

1114
00:56:46.833 --> 00:56:49.500
-Because he was on drugs.
-Right.

1115
00:56:50.708 --> 00:56:51.541
That's right.

1116
00:56:52.125 --> 00:56:54.541
SECURITEC
RECEPTION. VISITORS/DELIVERIES

1117
00:56:56.208 --> 00:56:57.458
Okay. Ousmane.

1118
00:56:58.041 --> 00:56:58.875
Ousmane!

1119
00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:01.791
The guys behind this door
worked with Carl.

1120
00:57:01.875 --> 00:57:03.875
They're probably all on the same drug.

1121
00:57:03.958 --> 00:57:04.791
Yeah. so?

1122
00:57:04.875 --> 00:57:07.541
So I think it's best if I take the lead
this time and you hang back.

1123
00:57:07.625 --> 00:57:09.625
so we avoid a situation
like the one at The Cherry.

1124
00:57:10.208 --> 00:57:11.291
What situation?

1125
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.208
Ah. right!

1126
00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:15.250
The fight!

1127
00:57:15.791 --> 00:57:17.916
-You sure?
-It's safer.

1128
00:57:19.958 --> 00:57:20.958
Okay.

1129
00:57:21.833 --> 00:57:22.666
Okay.

1130
00:57:27.666 --> 00:57:28.666
What's up. gym rats?

1131
00:57:29.375 --> 00:57:31.833
Don't stop on our account.
We're just the police.

1132
00:57:31.916 --> 00:57:34.375
That's right.
Those annoying cops are here.

1133
00:57:34.458 --> 00:57:36.375
Which one of you cupcakes is in charge?

1134
00:57:36.458 --> 00:57:37.958
Here we go.

1135
00:57:39.791 --> 00:57:40.791
Nobody move.

1136
00:57:43.791 --> 00:57:45.416
We want to speak to the manager.

1137
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.041
You didn't give a warning.

1138
00:57:48.208 --> 00:57:49.875
Oh. right. sorry. First warning.

1139
00:57:49.958 --> 00:57:52.666
-You have to say it before.
-It's too late.

1140
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.583
All right. Stallone. you can move.

1141
00:57:57.166 --> 00:58:00.000
Goran Jurdik. I'm the boss.
What do you want?

1142
00:58:00.083 --> 00:58:02.041
Hey. there he is! Leader of the cupcakes.

1143
00:58:02.125 --> 00:58:04.458
-Look around while we chat.
-Huh? But…

1144
00:58:05.416 --> 00:58:08.125
It's good to meet you. sir.

1145
00:58:08.208 --> 00:58:09.916
Please. man. You too.

1146
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.333
Back up. Right now. Make some room.

1147
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:16.166
Carl Müller. does it ring a bell?

1148
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:18.416
Yeah. sure. I know him.
Haven't seen him today.

1149
00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:25.875
-Does he have a locker?
-You'd know better if he's in custody.

1150
00:58:25.958 --> 00:58:29.291
-You know if he keeps anything here?
-Yeah. Over there.

1151
00:58:29.916 --> 00:58:31.458
François. the locker room.

1152
00:58:36.375 --> 00:58:37.375
Kevin Marchal.

1153
00:58:38.041 --> 00:58:39.333
No. Don't know him.

1154
00:58:39.416 --> 00:58:40.458
Of course not.

1155
00:58:40.541 --> 00:58:42.750
"N-words and homos" ring any bells?

1156
00:58:42.833 --> 00:58:45.166
Doesn't sound familiar to me.

1157
00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:47.083
But that's a good start.

1158
00:58:49.375 --> 00:58:52.333
Is it the mountain air.
or are your friends pretty doped up?

1159
00:58:53.166 --> 00:58:54.375
Huh. Well…

1160
00:58:54.916 --> 00:58:57.791
We could do urine samples if you want.
Guys'd love that.

1161
00:58:57.875 --> 00:58:59.166
Cups are by the coffee.

1162
00:59:12.125 --> 00:59:13.291
Oh. hello.

1163
00:59:13.375 --> 00:59:15.541
Lovely voice.

1164
00:59:18.375 --> 00:59:19.875
Hm.

1165
00:59:19.958 --> 00:59:21.791
What's that tattoo you all have?

1166
00:59:21.875 --> 00:59:24.583
What. this?
It's the symbol of the Sons of Clovis.

1167
00:59:24.666 --> 00:59:26.666
-What's that?
-It's a discussion group.

1168
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:30.291
We get together
and discuss our shared values.

1169
00:59:30.375 --> 00:59:33.666
I get the idea. A cross between
a book club and Fascists Anonymous.

1170
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:35.125
Huh.

1171
00:59:49.583 --> 00:59:50.666
You okay. François?

1172
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:52.083
Oh. yeah. I'm good.

1173
00:59:53.541 --> 00:59:55.375
Well. I think we all better go now.

1174
00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:57.208
Really? Why? We're having fun.

1175
00:59:57.291 --> 00:59:59.333
Even though there's
not a lot of color in here.

1176
00:59:59.416 --> 01:00:01.333
It seems to range from white to whiter.

1177
01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:02.875
Light white.

1178
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:04.833
Dark white.

1179
01:00:04.916 --> 01:00:06.750
Hmm. What else we got?

1180
01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.791
Oh! Two eggshell whites.

1181
01:00:09.875 --> 01:00:11.500
Ah! Red white!

1182
01:00:11.583 --> 01:00:14.916
You gotta be careful. Nothing less
than SPF 50. We in the mountains here.

1183
01:00:15.833 --> 01:00:16.875
Sun's closer.

1184
01:00:19.625 --> 01:00:23.250
Hey. bud. you got a warrant
to come stir all this shit up in here?

1185
01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:25.750
-"Bud"?
-What? I didn't think so.

1186
01:00:26.416 --> 01:00:27.875
Get this clown out of here.

1187
01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:29.750
Nobody move!

1188
01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:31.583
First warning.

1189
01:00:34.291 --> 01:00:35.916
See. Ousmane? That wasn't so hard.

1190
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.250
Our friend Carl does have a locker.
Guess what's inside?

1191
01:00:41.375 --> 01:00:42.375
Tokarev.

1192
01:00:49.416 --> 01:00:51.833
So. Carl was
one of Kevin's customers.

1193
01:00:51.916 --> 01:00:54.208
They had a falling-out
when he fell off the railroad bridge.

1194
01:00:54.291 --> 01:00:56.416
-Yeah.
-And the Sons of Clovis?

1195
01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:00.250
Come on. They don't see the world like
you do. That doesn't make them criminals.

1196
01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:02.125
Carl had a pick-up truck.
We didn't find it.

1197
01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:04.416
But the debris on the road
and the tire tracks match.

1198
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.000
-All right.
-Same with ballistics.

1199
01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:08.750
They confirmed it.
Looks like you found the murder weapon.

1200
01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:11.666
I call that a clean sweep.

1201
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:16.375
Congratulations. Your methods
are questionable. but those results…

1202
01:01:17.833 --> 01:01:19.583
-You too. Gauthier.
-Hmm.

1203
01:01:19.666 --> 01:01:20.750
Thank you. Chief.

1204
01:01:21.458 --> 01:01:23.333
First compliment in 18 months. Thanks.

1205
01:01:23.416 --> 01:01:25.416
Too bad it went by so fast.

1206
01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.875
Oh. also.
I'm going up to Paris in a month.

1207
01:01:27.958 --> 01:01:29.875
We should meet up. Ousmane?

1208
01:01:30.916 --> 01:01:32.166
Ousmane?

1209
01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:35.958
-Ousmane? Ousmane? Can I call you?
-Yeah.

1210
01:01:36.041 --> 01:01:38.541
Yeah. yeah. Great.
Are those guys just leaving?

1211
01:01:40.875 --> 01:01:43.916
Apart from a criminal fashion sense.
we don't have anything on them.

1212
01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:48.083
You don't wanna miss your train.

1213
01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:07.583
Are you in love? Hmm?

1214
01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:10.625
She's nice.
but there's more fish in the sea.

1215
01:02:10.708 --> 01:02:12.458
Anyway. you handled it like a pro.

1216
01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:15.916
-We just got screwed over.
-It's a game. dude.

1217
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.416
-Don't take it so seriously.
-It can't just be between Carl and Kevin.

1218
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.416
-Oh.
-It's too perfect. It's too clean.

1219
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.500
-We found the gun in his locker.
-Anyone could have put it there.

1220
01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:26.458
-Including Carl.
-Or the Sons of Clovis.

1221
01:02:27.416 --> 01:02:30.291
Carl's the ideal culprit.
He can't talk anymore.

1222
01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:32.791
So the case is closed
and everyone goes home.

1223
01:02:34.458 --> 01:02:36.500
We haven't followed up on all the leads.

1224
01:02:37.125 --> 01:02:39.875
Where are you going?
Hey! The train's coming in two minutes.

1225
01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:41.416
We're gonna go talk to the Snitch.

1226
01:02:44.625 --> 01:02:46.375
LASER TAG

1227
01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:47.375
Hi. there.

1228
01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:49.125
-Hey. guys. Are you here to play?
-Hello.

1229
01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:51.125
-No. We're looking for Nader. Is he here?
-Uh…

1230
01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:53.250
-The Snitch.
-He's back there.

1231
01:02:53.333 --> 01:02:56.083
He's in the middle of a game.
Sir. you can't just go in there!

1232
01:02:56.166 --> 01:02:57.583
-Hey! Sir. stop!
-Fight.

1233
01:02:57.666 --> 01:03:00.500
Ladies and gentlemen.
I hope your vests are strapped on.

1234
01:03:00.583 --> 01:03:02.250
This one sure isn't.

1235
01:03:02.333 --> 01:03:04.625
As a reminder.
when a member of your team gets shot.

1236
01:03:04.708 --> 01:03:06.583
you automatically lose
no less than ten points.

1237
01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:09.000
Not respecting the safety measures
will result

1238
01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:11.083
in an immediate ejection from the game.

1239
01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:12.083
Are you ready?

1240
01:03:12.166 --> 01:03:13.375
Yeah!

1241
01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:16.375
-Yeah!
-Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Goooo!

1242
01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:18.583
Go! Go!

1243
01:03:18.666 --> 01:03:20.083
-Go…
-Come here. Police.

1244
01:03:20.166 --> 01:03:21.458
Oh. why you runnin'?

1245
01:03:28.791 --> 01:03:30.125
-Go. go!
-Go!

1246
01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:34.125
Oh!

1247
01:03:36.041 --> 01:03:36.875
Nader!

1248
01:03:36.958 --> 01:03:39.208
That's the last one!

1249
01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:53.375
Nader! Come here!

1250
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.250
What the hell are you doing?
I almost had him!

1251
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:59.416
Get him!

1252
01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:02.250
Wait. There!

1253
01:04:03.458 --> 01:04:04.500
Son of a bitch!

1254
01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:06.375
Shit!

1255
01:04:11.625 --> 01:04:12.833
Get back here!

1256
01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:14.250
Nader!

1257
01:04:24.791 --> 01:04:26.958
I don't think
we've got the right shoes!

1258
01:04:27.041 --> 01:04:28.458
Ah! Let go!

1259
01:04:40.833 --> 01:04:42.916
Nader! Nader!

1260
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.833
-What are you--
-Hey!

1261
01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:46.916
Hey!

1262
01:04:50.458 --> 01:04:52.000
-Hey. hey!
-Please!

1263
01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:54.166
-Police!
-What the hell's going on?

1264
01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:57.041
Gonna need your kart. ma'am. Ah!

1265
01:05:05.458 --> 01:05:07.208
Hey. Hey!

1266
01:05:08.291 --> 01:05:09.375
Blind dickhead!

1267
01:05:16.375 --> 01:05:19.250
-Police! Out of the kart!
-What do you want? I didn't do anything!

1268
01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:20.958
Pull over!

1269
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:23.416
-Get him! Get him! Right there!
-Stop!

1270
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.083
-Out of the way!
-Stop!

1271
01:05:25.166 --> 01:05:28.333
-Police! You gotta block him!
-You gotta block him!

1272
01:05:28.416 --> 01:05:29.666
Go. go! Get him!

1273
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.541
Damn it! What are you doing?

1274
01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:34.666
Police!

1275
01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:38.541
Stop!

1276
01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:41.500
I'm innocent! Swear to God!

1277
01:05:41.583 --> 01:05:43.291
We're the authorities!

1278
01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:45.125
Hey!

1279
01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:48.458
Look at this! See this?

1280
01:05:49.708 --> 01:05:51.250
Stop right now!

1281
01:05:54.541 --> 01:05:55.916
Hey! Holy shit.

1282
01:05:56.708 --> 01:05:57.875
Police!

1283
01:05:59.583 --> 01:06:01.083
That's enough. young man. Come back!

1284
01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:02.666
-No!
-You're not getting away!

1285
01:06:05.833 --> 01:06:07.875
Nader! You are so grounded!

1286
01:06:10.625 --> 01:06:12.916
No! I didn't do anything!

1287
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.458
You're gonna hurt
these customers! Watch out!

1288
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:18.333
Look out! Sorry. ma'am. Sorry!

1289
01:06:19.791 --> 01:06:20.791
Sorry! It's slippery.

1290
01:06:20.875 --> 01:06:23.708
-Hey! Nader! Get back here! Nader!
-No!

1291
01:06:23.791 --> 01:06:25.625
Get back here! Don't be stupid!

1292
01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:26.875
-Police!
-Come on!

1293
01:06:26.958 --> 01:06:28.041
Nader. look out!

1294
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:31.083
Sir. look out!

1295
01:06:31.166 --> 01:06:32.625
To the left. the left!

1296
01:06:32.708 --> 01:06:33.708
Sorry.

1297
01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:35.416
Come on! Outta the way! Hey!

1298
01:06:36.333 --> 01:06:38.250
-Gimme that!
-Nader!

1299
01:06:40.708 --> 01:06:42.208
Out of the way!

1300
01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:43.625
He's throwing stuff at me!

1301
01:06:45.208 --> 01:06:47.375
-Oof!
-Hey! Hey!

1302
01:06:47.958 --> 01:06:50.291
-Nader! What the hell?
-Oh!

1303
01:06:52.333 --> 01:06:53.666
Ground beef!

1304
01:06:55.916 --> 01:06:57.125
Oh shit!

1305
01:06:57.208 --> 01:06:59.291
I almost had him!
What the hell are you doing?

1306
01:06:59.375 --> 01:07:02.083
I'll lead him to breakfast cereal.
You cut him off by home accessories.

1307
01:07:02.166 --> 01:07:04.166
-Okay. let's go.
-We'll hit him from both sides!

1308
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:05.875
Come on. Go! Go!

1309
01:07:05.958 --> 01:07:07.625
Move. move. move. move!

1310
01:07:09.666 --> 01:07:11.333
Police! Out of the way. okay?

1311
01:07:14.166 --> 01:07:15.500
Hey. hey!

1312
01:07:17.708 --> 01:07:18.625
Shit!

1313
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.875
Clear! Move!

1314
01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:27.666
Oh!

1315
01:07:35.541 --> 01:07:38.291
-Go on. Get back.
-No. you can't do this!

1316
01:07:38.375 --> 01:07:40.875
-Nothing to see here. Keep shopping.
-Am I being arrested?

1317
01:07:40.958 --> 01:07:43.208
-There's a sale on baked goods!
-You're hurting me!

1318
01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:46.083
-Dude! You're hurting me!
-Got your diapers now. Be a big boy.

1319
01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:48.125
Sorry. I shouldn't have
ran away like that.

1320
01:07:48.208 --> 01:07:50.125
But I have a lot of problems
with the police.

1321
01:07:50.208 --> 01:07:52.333
I talk. and it always
gets me into trouble.

1322
01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:54.708
-It's the worst.
-Why do they call you The Snitch?

1323
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:57.666
-Uh… Well. 'cause of that.
-Talk about Kevin Marchal.

1324
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:59.375
-Huh?
-You were dealing with him.

1325
01:07:59.458 --> 01:08:01.583
-Too much? You freaked?
-That's not what freaked me out.

1326
01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:03.625
-It was the guys he hung with.
-The Sons of Clovis?

1327
01:08:03.708 --> 01:08:04.958
-Wow. Leading question.
-So what?

1328
01:08:05.041 --> 01:08:07.291
-Allow me. Was it the Sons of Clovis?
-Yeah.

1329
01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:08.666
-There you go.
-There you go.

1330
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:11.375
-You just said it.
-They think they police the neighborhood.

1331
01:08:11.458 --> 01:08:13.708
-That is a problem.
-They're psychos! Crazy!

1332
01:08:13.791 --> 01:08:16.916
We were afraid to go outside. Even Kevin
freaked. okay? He called the police.

1333
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.416
-Kevin was freaked out?
-Mm-hm.

1334
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:21.250
-What'd the cops do?
-Well. this one cop came. Uh…

1335
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.083
And he promised to help us out.
It was a chief.

1336
01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:25.750
-Name?
-Morbier.

1337
01:08:25.833 --> 01:08:27.291
-No. not Morbier…
-Was it Mercier?

1338
01:08:27.375 --> 01:08:28.541
Shit. you're doing it again.

1339
01:08:28.625 --> 01:08:31.416
-Come on. what else do you need?
-Shit. Chief Mercier?

1340
01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:32.708
Chief Mercier. Yeah. that's it.

1341
01:08:32.791 --> 01:08:35.208
-Are you kidding me?
-Why would I be? What?

1342
01:08:35.291 --> 01:08:36.416
I just heard you say "Chief."

1343
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.666
-You said "Mercier."
-But he hadn't said "Chief."

1344
01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:41.250
-He looked for the name. That's a detail.
-It's okay.

1345
01:08:41.333 --> 01:08:42.875
-That's not a detail!
-You gave the name.

1346
01:08:42.958 --> 01:08:44.625
-There's only one chief here!
-Don't--

1347
01:08:44.708 --> 01:08:48.708
-Incompetence I can handle. but protocol…
-Take it easy! I swear it's Chief Mercier!

1348
01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.750
I know for sure. Kevin told me.
He even called him a few times.

1349
01:08:51.833 --> 01:08:53.541
Kevin called the chief? And then what?

1350
01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:55.041
-He was murdered.
-Yeah.

1351
01:08:55.125 --> 01:08:57.666
-The chief never mentioned this call.
-He didn't?

1352
01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:59.875
-You don't think that's strange?
-No.

1353
01:08:59.958 --> 01:09:03.083
-It is!
-The guy's a chief. He forgot. It's not--

1354
01:09:03.166 --> 01:09:04.416
-He forgot?
-Yep.

1355
01:09:05.125 --> 01:09:07.083
And you have a problem with poor protocol?

1356
01:09:08.041 --> 01:09:10.666
Hey. hey. hey. hey! Wait. wait…

1357
01:09:12.541 --> 01:09:14.708
-Sir. are you a chief?
-Insh'Allah.

1358
01:09:14.791 --> 01:09:16.083
Allah oma amine khoya. for real.

1359
01:09:16.166 --> 01:09:17.541
-What did you say?
-Huh?

1360
01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:19.541
-What did you say?
-No. I thought--

1361
01:09:19.625 --> 01:09:22.125
-You better watch yourself. Okay?
-Go on.

1362
01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:27.833
He's a slippery little bastard. isn't he?

1363
01:09:28.625 --> 01:09:29.458
All right…

1364
01:09:36.666 --> 01:09:38.541
PUBLIC SECURITY

1365
01:09:39.458 --> 01:09:41.666
You shouldn't leave
your keys in the visor.

1366
01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:43.916
Why are you worried?
Who'd steal a car here?

1367
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.125
Well. us.

1368
01:09:45.708 --> 01:09:49.750
If Mercier's in on it. it's out of
our jurisdiction. We're outside the law.

1369
01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:51.708
We are the law.

1370
01:09:57.083 --> 01:10:00.666
And here we go. Theft of a
police vehicle. and illegal surveillance.

1371
01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.833
-That's a real nice place for a chief.
-Hmm.

1372
01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:44.625
Bonuses.

1373
01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:47.833
Right? Do chiefs get bonuses?

1374
01:10:47.916 --> 01:10:48.833
Hmm?

1375
01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:51.375
There you go.

1376
01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:03.416
-Gentlemen. Afternoon.
-Aah!

1377
01:11:04.708 --> 01:11:07.833
-Hello. Mr. Mayor.
-Hi. Mr. Mayor.

1378
01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:11.625
I assume you both came up here
for recreation.

1379
01:11:11.708 --> 01:11:14.375
considering you solved the case
you were sent here to investigate?

1380
01:11:14.458 --> 01:11:16.666
Did Mercier report to you
like a good little boy?

1381
01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:19.416
Well. Chief Mercier is a long-time friend.

1382
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.416
And it just so happens we need to discuss
the expansion of the precinct.

1383
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.041
-I don't think this concerns you.
-All right. You see?

1384
01:11:25.125 --> 01:11:27.625
-I don't care for your tone. chief.
-Kevin Marchal.

1385
01:11:27.708 --> 01:11:30.791
-Was he selling your militia vitamins?
-What's he talking about?

1386
01:11:30.875 --> 01:11:32.208
Your men were pressuring him.

1387
01:11:32.291 --> 01:11:35.041
So he called Chief Mercier.
looking for protection.

1388
01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:37.791
But he didn't know
Chief Mercier was part of the gang.

1389
01:11:38.416 --> 01:11:39.375
Bye-bye. Kevin.

1390
01:11:39.458 --> 01:11:42.291
Okay. stop. Ousmane.
Excuse him. Mr. Mayor.

1391
01:11:43.416 --> 01:11:44.250
Am I wrong?

1392
01:11:45.125 --> 01:11:49.125
I'm sensing fury
in your voice. chief.

1393
01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:50.083
Mmm.

1394
01:11:50.166 --> 01:11:52.500
-Okay.
-I get it. I get it.

1395
01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:54.250
I represent everything you hate.

1396
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:59.125
A man of the people. like you.
who made it. without complaining.

1397
01:11:59.208 --> 01:12:01.250
without making excuses when he failed.

1398
01:12:01.833 --> 01:12:03.291
Who never begged for anything.

1399
01:12:03.375 --> 01:12:06.458
A white man. The eternal oppressor.

1400
01:12:08.875 --> 01:12:10.375
But you know what? I really like you.

1401
01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:14.833
And. yes. I could tell your superiors
about this rude interruption.

1402
01:12:14.916 --> 01:12:16.833
outside your jurisdiction.

1403
01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:20.625
I've done my research on you.
thanks to my friends at the Ministry.

1404
01:12:21.208 --> 01:12:23.041
-Great career.
-Hmm…

1405
01:12:23.125 --> 01:12:24.916
-Oh. yeah. Great career.
-It's okay.

1406
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.208
With a known penchant for insubordination.

1407
01:12:27.291 --> 01:12:31.958
I have a feeling affirmative action won't
be protecting you for much longer. chief.

1408
01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:33.208
Mm. See?

1409
01:12:33.291 --> 01:12:35.125
Affirmative action.

1410
01:12:36.041 --> 01:12:39.583
Oh. he. uh. charmed you. too. huh?

1411
01:12:39.666 --> 01:12:41.833
-The great African male.
-Ah. Wow.

1412
01:12:41.916 --> 01:12:45.500
You petit bourgeois.
end-of-the-line. little house cat.

1413
01:12:46.166 --> 01:12:47.458
You like his wild side.

1414
01:12:48.083 --> 01:12:49.166
Indomitable.

1415
01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:52.875
He overpowers you. and you just love it.

1416
01:12:54.333 --> 01:12:56.208
First of all. "petit bourgeois…"

1417
01:12:56.291 --> 01:12:58.625
And. hey. "overpowering" me. I don't--

1418
01:13:00.458 --> 01:13:03.125
What if I do wanna
be overpowered by a big Black guy?

1419
01:13:03.208 --> 01:13:06.291
Huh? A brother. A Moor.
A melanated man. A swarthy fellow.

1420
01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:07.708
-Nice one. Okay.
-No. no. no.

1421
01:13:07.791 --> 01:13:09.708
Some things I can take.
but this is too far.

1422
01:13:09.791 --> 01:13:12.375
What exactly don't you like?
His glistening skin?

1423
01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:13.958
His taut muscles? His swagger?

1424
01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:15.750
-Or that curvy booty?
-What are you--

1425
01:13:15.833 --> 01:13:18.416
-We spent the night. and he was nervous.
-What are you doing?

1426
01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.875
-Defending you.
-Cut it out!

1427
01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:23.833
Sorry to say. you're still just
two little insignificant

1428
01:13:23.916 --> 01:13:27.375
civil servants from Paris.
punching way above your weight. and so

1429
01:13:28.458 --> 01:13:30.291
if you care about
the rest of your careers.

1430
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:34.166
get outta here
before I charge you with harassment.

1431
01:13:34.916 --> 01:13:35.958
Friendly advice.

1432
01:13:38.125 --> 01:13:39.375
See you soon. my friend.

1433
01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:41.250
All right. Drive safe!

1434
01:13:44.416 --> 01:13:46.416
-Why did you say that?
-What?

1435
01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.916
-I wasn't nervous!
-Relax!

1436
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.833
I don't think so. You go first.
You checking out my ass?

1437
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:59.958
Where are you going now. Mercier?

1438
01:14:01.958 --> 01:14:03.791
Are you ever
gonna let me drive?

1439
01:14:12.083 --> 01:14:14.708
Mercier was in touch with Kevin
right before he died.

1440
01:14:14.791 --> 01:14:16.791
They'll like that. Internal Affairs.

1441
01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:30.000
-Too close. He'll see us.
-I know how to tail someone.

1442
01:14:36.541 --> 01:14:38.541
Brunner will come up if we dig around.

1443
01:14:40.291 --> 01:14:42.541
Our witnesses are a stripper and a dealer.

1444
01:14:42.625 --> 01:14:44.291
I don't know. Against the mayor…

1445
01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:46.708
That's why we can't lose Mercier.

1446
01:14:47.375 --> 01:14:48.916
He's our ticket into their business.

1447
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:56.958
This isn't a tail.
It's a police escort.

1448
01:15:17.833 --> 01:15:19.166
He's trying to ram us over!

1449
01:15:20.833 --> 01:15:21.875
Push 'em off!

1450
01:15:44.791 --> 01:15:45.750
Go on! Hit 'em!

1451
01:15:49.416 --> 01:15:51.375
-Shit! Do something!
-What do you want me to do?

1452
01:15:51.458 --> 01:15:52.666
I don't know! Where's your gun?

1453
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:53.833
Oh. yeah.

1454
01:16:01.041 --> 01:16:01.875
Shit!

1455
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.333
Stop swerving!

1456
01:16:16.958 --> 01:16:18.458
-Is he still there?
-Yeah.

1457
01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:19.750
'Cause you're driving.

1458
01:16:21.583 --> 01:16:22.500
Shit.

1459
01:16:25.875 --> 01:16:27.416
-Speed up!
-I am!

1460
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.375
This is a cop car! Not exactly a Ferrari!

1461
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:35.083
Bastards.

1462
01:16:37.291 --> 01:16:38.291
Do Ferraris have these?

1463
01:16:42.416 --> 01:16:43.416
Do it! One…

1464
01:16:44.875 --> 01:16:46.375
Two… Three!

1465
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.250
Shit! Fuck! Shit!

1466
01:16:50.416 --> 01:16:52.583
Stop the fucking car!

1467
01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:18.208
-Okay?
-Yeah. You?

1468
01:17:18.291 --> 01:17:19.458
Yeah. I'm fine.

1469
01:17:20.875 --> 01:17:22.541
I think I'm fine.

1470
01:17:36.958 --> 01:17:40.041
-Hey. Ous. What's up?
-Hey. Yas. You got something?

1471
01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:42.208
-Yeah. I spoke to my guys at the lab.
-And?

1472
01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.291
The methamphetamine you found
is called Pervitin.

1473
01:17:44.375 --> 01:17:46.125
The Nazis used it during the war.

1474
01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:47.333
-You're kidding.
-No.

1475
01:17:47.416 --> 01:17:48.750
To keep guys from getting hooked.

1476
01:17:48.833 --> 01:17:51.625
they laced it with other crap.
um. cocaine. oxycodone.

1477
01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:52.916
Which makes D-IX.

1478
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.750
-On that stuff. you don't feel anything.
-Oh!

1479
01:17:54.833 --> 01:17:57.333
Anyway. that's what
that guy's test results said.

1480
01:17:57.416 --> 01:17:59.208
Not sure what you're up to.
but be careful.

1481
01:17:59.291 --> 01:18:00.541
Hey. Yas!

1482
01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:01.625
It's François.

1483
01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:03.166
-Uh… Uh…
-Wh…

1484
01:18:03.250 --> 01:18:05.333
-François Monge.
-You're with Monge?

1485
01:18:05.416 --> 01:18:06.916
-I'll explain later.
-How are you?

1486
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.625
I'm good. I'm good. but…

1487
01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:10.833
-And-- What? It's a free country.
-Stop it. You said hi.

1488
01:18:10.916 --> 01:18:13.458
-I'm having a conversation. Shut up. Go.
-Well. yeah… Okay. fine.

1489
01:18:13.541 --> 01:18:15.416
I'm sorry. I'll explain later.

1490
01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.375
-Thanks. Yas.
-See you guys later.

1491
01:18:17.458 --> 01:18:18.500
God!

1492
01:18:19.916 --> 01:18:22.125
Hey. you were right.
It's not just a few fascists.

1493
01:18:22.208 --> 01:18:24.791
No. It's a fucking army.

1494
01:18:37.208 --> 01:18:39.458
-What the hell? Who does this?
-It's just us.

1495
01:18:39.541 --> 01:18:40.916
We can explain.

1496
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.666
Told you we should've turned the lamp on.

1497
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.166
-Sorry. Yeah.
-You should be.

1498
01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:46.375
-Did we scare you?
-Yeah. A little bit.

1499
01:18:47.625 --> 01:18:49.750
-We need to talk.
-Hmm.

1500
01:18:49.833 --> 01:18:52.875
The real question isn't who. but why.
Why is Brunner doing this?

1501
01:18:52.958 --> 01:18:55.958
He's got his drugged-up army.
He runs the neighborhoods.

1502
01:18:56.041 --> 01:18:58.500
-He kills people who know too much. Kevin.
-Or us.

1503
01:18:58.583 --> 01:19:01.625
-You don't do all that for law and order.
-That's why he was elected.

1504
01:19:01.708 --> 01:19:03.916
Either way. we'd better find out fast.

1505
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.166
We're not gonna crack this tonight.
I'll pull out the couch for you guys.

1506
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:09.250
-You don't mind sharing a bed?
-Not at all.

1507
01:19:09.833 --> 01:19:11.333
We're used to it.

1508
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:17.291
This is gonna sound weird.

1509
01:19:17.375 --> 01:19:20.041
but you know what I was thinking
when we were in the car?

1510
01:19:20.125 --> 01:19:23.208
"Wow. it's been a long time
since I've felt so at home like this."

1511
01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:24.750
And it was with you.

1512
01:19:27.791 --> 01:19:30.125
Also. I wanted to apologize about Yasmine.

1513
01:19:30.208 --> 01:19:31.541
Oh. it's all right.

1514
01:19:31.625 --> 01:19:32.791
No. you were right.

1515
01:19:33.666 --> 01:19:35.500
I was jealous of you. Your success.

1516
01:19:35.583 --> 01:19:38.333
I tried to get revenge
the only way I knew how.

1517
01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.541
I'm not proud of it. I apologize.

1518
01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:47.916
Okay.

1519
01:19:58.375 --> 01:19:59.666
Is that all you wanna say?

1520
01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:02.125
Yeah. uh…

1521
01:20:02.208 --> 01:20:04.625
Did you wanna say you're sorry.
for example?

1522
01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:07.875
-Sorry for what?
-You tell me.

1523
01:20:07.958 --> 01:20:10.208
You're a pain in the ass.

1524
01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:14.875
Okay. fine. I'm sorry too. There.

1525
01:20:14.958 --> 01:20:16.125
-Yeah?
-Okay?

1526
01:20:16.208 --> 01:20:17.500
Hm. What for?

1527
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.000
For the chief of police exam.

1528
01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:25.041
-Hmm.
-You were right. I snubbed you.

1529
01:20:25.791 --> 01:20:26.833
I was mad about Yasmine.

1530
01:20:28.833 --> 01:20:32.083
Now that you've said it.
I might be able to forgive you some day.

1531
01:20:33.541 --> 01:20:34.833
We're making progress.

1532
01:20:35.875 --> 01:20:36.958
This is cool.

1533
01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:40.625
You know what I'm thinking?

1534
01:20:40.708 --> 01:20:43.583
For all we know. I keep failing
the police chief's exam over and over

1535
01:20:43.666 --> 01:20:44.750
just to piss off my dad.

1536
01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:46.791
Hmm?

1537
01:20:47.666 --> 01:20:50.083
I mean. you passed. It can't be that hard.

1538
01:20:51.583 --> 01:20:53.833
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
Okay?

1539
01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:56.041
Yeah. you're right.
That's pseudo-psychology.

1540
01:20:57.791 --> 01:20:59.875
Also. you can have Alice.
I'm officially dropping out.

1541
01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:02.916
Dropping out of what?
You think I need your permission?

1542
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.291
come on.

1543
01:21:05.541 --> 01:21:06.958
Good night. boys.

1544
01:21:08.375 --> 01:21:10.958
-Shit. She got some thin walls.
-Man.

1545
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:12.875
Good night.

1546
01:21:22.958 --> 01:21:25.750
François. Underwear on.

1547
01:21:32.541 --> 01:21:34.500
It's amazing
how much we have in common.

1548
01:21:34.583 --> 01:21:36.291
We eat the same thing in the morning.

1549
01:21:36.375 --> 01:21:38.250
-Amazing. I mean…
-Isn't it?

1550
01:21:38.333 --> 01:21:40.083
-Not just strawberries and honey.
-No!

1551
01:21:40.166 --> 01:21:42.333
-Dordogne strawberries with Acacia.
-Dordogne…

1552
01:21:42.416 --> 01:21:44.500
-Are you into astrology?
-What time is it?

1553
01:21:46.458 --> 01:21:48.291
-Why didn't you wake me up?
-You were sleeping.

1554
01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:50.375
So you only wake people up
if they're not sleeping?

1555
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:53.750
-Sorry. How are you?
-Oh. I'm… great.

1556
01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:56.250
I was chatting with François.

1557
01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:58.000
-About?
-What we should do now.

1558
01:21:58.583 --> 01:22:00.083
We can't go after Brunner directly.

1559
01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:02.375
-Too risky. We find a weakness.
-Here's the plan.

1560
01:22:02.458 --> 01:22:03.666
You stay here where it's safe.

1561
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:06.375
I go to the station
and get all the files we have on him.

1562
01:22:06.458 --> 01:22:09.625
-Then we go through everything together.
-Okay. yeah. Let's do that.

1563
01:22:09.708 --> 01:22:11.083
-Really?
-Yeah.

1564
01:22:11.166 --> 01:22:13.458
You'd rather put your head to work
than your legs.

1565
01:22:14.083 --> 01:22:16.041
I'm gonna shower.

1566
01:22:21.666 --> 01:22:23.500
See? I don't need permission either.

1567
01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:29.541
I'm shocked.
I didn't think she was that easy.

1568
01:22:32.041 --> 01:22:33.750
Wanna get out of here?

1569
01:22:33.833 --> 01:22:34.916
What for?

1570
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.541
The guy's preparing for war.
Don't you wanna know against who?

1571
01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:39.958
You'd rather stay and eat crackers?

1572
01:22:41.208 --> 01:22:43.250
Oh. okay.. That's what I was thinking.

1573
01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:46.416
-And Alice?
-Too dangerous. You're right.

1574
01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:47.833
Let's head out. Come on.

1575
01:23:01.833 --> 01:23:04.166
So. let's recap. Disobeying protocol.

1576
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:06.208
We're trying to return to protocol.

1577
01:23:06.291 --> 01:23:08.833
-Stealing a police vehicle.
-We are police.

1578
01:23:08.916 --> 01:23:10.333
Breaking and entering.

1579
01:23:10.416 --> 01:23:12.000
Uh. guess you're right.

1580
01:23:21.833 --> 01:23:24.333
Oh shit!

1581
01:23:31.458 --> 01:23:32.750
Aussaresses!

1582
01:23:35.125 --> 01:23:35.958
There!

1583
01:23:38.666 --> 01:23:40.458
Aussaresses. shut up!

1584
01:23:43.916 --> 01:23:46.083
This dog is driving me crazy.

1585
01:23:46.166 --> 01:23:48.666
Ugh. You're supposed to stay outside.

1586
01:23:50.083 --> 01:23:52.250
You don't like it.
take it up with your father.

1587
01:24:02.666 --> 01:24:04.625
-I got upstairs. you got downstairs.
-Why?

1588
01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:06.500
-Because.
-Why not the reverse?

1589
01:24:07.166 --> 01:24:09.708
-'Cause I'm right here.
-I checked down there. There's nothing.

1590
01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:11.875
-Not down here. down there.
-"Dow-ear"?

1591
01:24:11.958 --> 01:24:14.000
-Down there!
-I don't speak African.

1592
01:24:15.041 --> 01:24:16.041
Go over there!

1593
01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:33.208
Ugh. Natalia.
I'm so sick of this dog.

1594
01:25:33.291 --> 01:25:34.750
I'm gonna put him down.

1595
01:25:34.833 --> 01:25:37.041
-I hate that dog.
-Hey. sweetie?

1596
01:25:39.416 --> 01:25:41.125
Your piano teacher's on the way.

1597
01:25:41.208 --> 01:25:42.708
Go practice your scales.

1598
01:25:43.583 --> 01:25:45.166
Psst. Psst!

1599
01:25:56.333 --> 01:25:58.208
I don't understand.

1600
01:25:58.291 --> 01:26:00.875
-Oh man.
-Speak. Speak with your mouth.

1601
01:26:03.416 --> 01:26:04.708
-Press unmute.
-Sorry.

1602
01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:08.208
You go that way. I go that way.
And by the end. we meet up here.

1603
01:26:08.291 --> 01:26:09.291
What floor are you on?

1604
01:26:10.625 --> 01:26:13.833
-Um… From where?
-I don't know! Where you came from.

1605
01:26:15.208 --> 01:26:17.291
Well. there's one floor below
and two above.

1606
01:26:17.375 --> 01:26:20.083
One below you.
one above me from the bottom.

1607
01:26:20.166 --> 01:26:23.083
Right. I see three floors below.
but two above. See you soon.

1608
01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.500
-How'd you get here?
-There's another door.

1609
01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:53.791
-Okay. so?
-Nothing.

1610
01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:54.875
-You?
-Nothing.

1611
01:26:54.958 --> 01:26:56.625
We missed something.

1612
01:26:59.375 --> 01:27:00.875
-Shit. Brunner.
-What about him?

1613
01:27:00.958 --> 01:27:02.083
His stick.

1614
01:27:02.166 --> 01:27:04.291
-You didn't see his stick?
-Why would I notice that?

1615
01:27:04.375 --> 01:27:05.916
-It was in your face.
-What the fuck?

1616
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.958
-It was in his hand!
-My God. You are disgusting.

1617
01:27:10.083 --> 01:27:11.666
If there's a stick. there's a table.

1618
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:14.416
If there's a pool table.
there's a billiard room. We missed it!

1619
01:27:15.625 --> 01:27:17.791
Hey. not bad. All right. nice one.

1620
01:27:24.875 --> 01:27:26.500
-François?
-What?

1621
01:27:26.583 --> 01:27:27.583
What are you doing?

1622
01:27:28.166 --> 01:27:29.000
Coming.

1623
01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:30.375
I can see you.

1624
01:27:30.458 --> 01:27:31.291
Yeah.

1625
01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:34.791
Ah.

1626
01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:46.125
Hey. Psst.

1627
01:28:00.791 --> 01:28:01.875
Of course.

1628
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:05.250
-Of course the guy has a man cave.
-What for?

1629
01:28:05.333 --> 01:28:08.041
Well. you know. his own space
to decompress in privacy.

1630
01:28:09.875 --> 01:28:12.416
A guy with taste like this
can't be all bad. right?

1631
01:28:13.125 --> 01:28:13.958
A mosque.

1632
01:28:14.958 --> 01:28:17.208
A hookah lounge. A synagogue.

1633
01:28:18.083 --> 01:28:19.375
An immigrant center.

1634
01:28:21.375 --> 01:28:23.583
It's all there. The start time.

1635
01:28:24.458 --> 01:28:26.458
The location. the target…

1636
01:28:26.541 --> 01:28:28.916
This is what Kevin Marchal discovered.

1637
01:28:29.416 --> 01:28:31.166
The grand plan that scared him.

1638
01:28:32.916 --> 01:28:34.333
Coordinated attacks.

1639
01:28:37.166 --> 01:28:38.958
Looks like it kicks off at 5:00 p.m.

1640
01:28:39.458 --> 01:28:40.291
What day?

1641
01:28:46.625 --> 01:28:49.416
Alice. Sorry we rushed out.
but it's worse than we thought.

1642
01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:53.166
Get all the backup you can and meet us
right away at Lefranc's print shop.

1643
01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:54.500
All right. I got it.

1644
01:28:54.583 --> 01:28:57.875
Except I can't send her GPS coordinates
because she wouldn't give me her number.

1645
01:28:57.958 --> 01:29:01.166
I can't explain right now.
I'm sending you GPS coordinates.

1646
01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:03.083
-Kisses.
-"Kisses"?

1647
01:29:04.166 --> 01:29:05.000
It slipped out.

1648
01:29:19.375 --> 01:29:20.333
This is the place.

1649
01:29:27.666 --> 01:29:29.041
Thanks.

1650
01:29:30.041 --> 01:29:31.000
How considerate.

1651
01:30:01.125 --> 01:30:04.250
The time has finally come. my friends!

1652
01:30:04.333 --> 01:30:05.708
-Yeah!
-My brothers!

1653
01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:12.041
To begin a new page in the great book
of our shared history.

1654
01:30:12.125 --> 01:30:16.500
The time has finally come
for the birth of a new world order!

1655
01:30:16.583 --> 01:30:17.583
Yeah!

1656
01:30:17.666 --> 01:30:20.041
A world where we will no longer be afraid.

1657
01:30:20.125 --> 01:30:21.666
-Finally.
-Mmm.

1658
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:26.041
Because fear and shame
belong to our enemies alone!

1659
01:30:31.458 --> 01:30:34.208
But I know you are just
a different breed of men!

1660
01:30:34.291 --> 01:30:36.500
You are not monsters!

1661
01:30:36.583 --> 01:30:39.000
-No!
-You are the resistance!

1662
01:30:39.083 --> 01:30:40.250
Heroes!

1663
01:30:40.333 --> 01:30:41.666
-Yeah!
-We're together!

1664
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:43.541
And with me. you are never alone!

1665
01:30:43.625 --> 01:30:44.625
No! Never!

1666
01:30:44.708 --> 01:30:47.541
All our friends in Europe.
and in New Zealand.

1667
01:30:47.625 --> 01:30:50.083
Russia. the United States.

1668
01:30:50.166 --> 01:30:52.916
they all want the same thing we do!

1669
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.833
-All of them!
-Autonomy! And resistance!

1670
01:30:55.916 --> 01:30:56.791
Yeah!

1671
01:30:58.625 --> 01:30:59.750
However…

1672
01:31:01.208 --> 01:31:02.708
resistance

1673
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.833
is just not enough.

1674
01:31:05.916 --> 01:31:07.541
-No!
-It's time to attack.

1675
01:31:07.625 --> 01:31:09.166
Yeah!

1676
01:31:11.625 --> 01:31:16.041
A single spark can set the world on fire
and show us what's really possible.

1677
01:31:16.125 --> 01:31:18.375
-Right!
-As of now. you are the spark!

1678
01:31:21.875 --> 01:31:24.041
In a few hours.
every news outlet

1679
01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:28.625
will realize
an incontestable. glorious truth.

1680
01:31:29.208 --> 01:31:31.291
This country belongs to us!

1681
01:31:31.375 --> 01:31:32.291
Yes!

1682
01:31:32.375 --> 01:31:34.541
-We will fight to the end…
-Bravo!

1683
01:31:34.625 --> 01:31:36.166
-…to win it back.
-There are tons of 'em.

1684
01:31:36.250 --> 01:31:37.375
We can't arrest everyone.

1685
01:31:37.458 --> 01:31:40.875
No. not if they leave.
We have to keep 'em here.

1686
01:31:41.875 --> 01:31:43.708
Shit. No service.

1687
01:32:10.833 --> 01:32:13.958
Okay. I'll figure it out.
Just make sure they all stay inside.

1688
01:32:14.958 --> 01:32:16.666
-Why me?
-Just because.

1689
01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:19.708
-Because what?
-I don't look like I play for their team.

1690
01:32:19.791 --> 01:32:21.541
So what? I look like a fascist to you?

1691
01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:24.166
-No! But you're not Black.
-I'm not Black?

1692
01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:25.625
-Are you?
-No.

1693
01:32:25.708 --> 01:32:27.833
-No. Okay?
-Okay. You're playing that card.

1694
01:32:27.916 --> 01:32:30.041
-What. the facts card?
-It's fine. I'll do it.

1695
01:32:30.125 --> 01:32:31.833
-You're not Black!
-I'll do it alone.

1696
01:32:31.916 --> 01:32:32.833
You'll do what alone?

1697
01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:35.916
It's that way.

1698
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.666
I know. I'm not going
in there empty-handed.

1699
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:39.875
So I'm gonna have to improvise.

1700
01:32:42.666 --> 01:32:45.833
All right. if this goes south.
the code word is your name. Okay?

1701
01:32:45.916 --> 01:32:47.333
-"Yorname"?
-Yeah.

1702
01:32:47.416 --> 01:32:50.083
That's a weird code word.
Shouldn't it be simpler?

1703
01:32:50.166 --> 01:32:52.583
No. it's your name.
Your actual name. Ousmane.

1704
01:32:53.208 --> 01:32:55.458
Okay. so if it's my name.
you're addressing me.

1705
01:32:55.541 --> 01:32:57.208
-That's not a code word.
-Yeah. sure it is.

1706
01:32:57.291 --> 01:33:00.375
-But. no--
-I chose it. I know it's a code word.

1707
01:33:00.458 --> 01:33:01.916
-If you say "Ousmane"…
-Yeah?

1708
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.083
-…you're just saying my name.
-Okay. it's fine.

1709
01:33:04.166 --> 01:33:06.416
-But--
-I thought I'd do something nice for you.

1710
01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:09.000
-I thought you'd be touched. It's fine.
-Oh. you want a thank you?

1711
01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:11.125
-No. why would I?
-You thought I'd be touched?

1712
01:33:11.208 --> 01:33:13.375
Okay. thank you. François. Thank you.

1713
01:33:13.458 --> 01:33:14.500
All right.

1714
01:33:15.125 --> 01:33:16.791
Okay. then. Goodbye.

1715
01:33:16.875 --> 01:33:18.541
-Or farewell.
-Farewell?

1716
01:33:19.375 --> 01:33:21.416
Stop it. It's gonna be fine. okay?

1717
01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:22.875
I'm here.

1718
01:33:45.625 --> 01:33:49.333
-What's this shithead doing here?
-Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore!

1719
01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:53.166
Bravo. madam. Nice vibrato.
Can you do "Free Bird" next?

1720
01:34:03.541 --> 01:34:06.250
Captain Monge. there's being stubborn
and there's being stupid.

1721
01:34:06.333 --> 01:34:08.458
-Oh. yeah?
-Did your boyfriend drop you off?

1722
01:34:08.541 --> 01:34:10.500
We broke up. That's right. I left him.

1723
01:34:10.583 --> 01:34:11.583
I've been thinking…

1724
01:34:11.666 --> 01:34:15.458
Yeah. yeah. No. I think that I'm really
one of you. I belong right here.

1725
01:34:15.541 --> 01:34:18.833
So. what's the next step?
Is there some kind of test?

1726
01:34:18.916 --> 01:34:20.250
Psychological screening?

1727
01:34:20.875 --> 01:34:22.833
No. not psychological. no. Physical?

1728
01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:29.583
And I'm pretty well off. I'm white.

1729
01:34:29.666 --> 01:34:31.666
I'm baptized. Does that matter to you?

1730
01:34:32.416 --> 01:34:35.416
Bonus points. right?
I assume being Catholic is a plus?

1731
01:34:40.208 --> 01:34:42.041
I detest everyone outside our border.

1732
01:34:42.125 --> 01:34:44.625
Um. Africans. Asians. Arabs.

1733
01:34:44.708 --> 01:34:48.083
-Except for their food. I mean. shawarma--
-All right. That's enough.

1734
01:34:50.125 --> 01:34:52.875
One more step. I blow the place up. okay?

1735
01:34:53.583 --> 01:34:54.791
Put it down. Put it down.

1736
01:34:54.875 --> 01:34:57.458
-What the hell is that?
-Easy. Easy. man.

1737
01:35:01.666 --> 01:35:02.500
Hey!

1738
01:35:03.375 --> 01:35:04.875
-Are you alone?
-Yes. François?

1739
01:35:05.458 --> 01:35:07.625
Inside. Let's finish this. and then we…

1740
01:35:08.583 --> 01:35:10.041
-Easy.
-What are you doing?

1741
01:35:10.125 --> 01:35:12.583
Why didn't you just leave?
It would have been so much simpler.

1742
01:35:12.666 --> 01:35:15.000
-Did they threaten you?
-You think they're the bad guys?

1743
01:35:16.458 --> 01:35:18.291
-This isn't you.
-No. it isn't me.

1744
01:35:18.916 --> 01:35:21.875
Not sweet little Alice
that's into the big Paris cop.

1745
01:35:22.375 --> 01:35:24.625
Huh? The nice girl who's always
got a smile?

1746
01:35:25.625 --> 01:35:26.833
You really don't get it.

1747
01:35:26.916 --> 01:35:29.083
We're not gonna change anything
with some extra patrols

1748
01:35:29.166 --> 01:35:30.750
and soccer games with the local kids.

1749
01:35:30.833 --> 01:35:32.791
Brunner's right. We have to start over.

1750
01:35:32.875 --> 01:35:34.791
-Blank state.
-By killing innocent people?

1751
01:35:34.875 --> 01:35:36.750
Yeah. Let's go.

1752
01:35:36.833 --> 01:35:39.041
Now we're calm. Okay?

1753
01:35:39.708 --> 01:35:41.416
Get out of here! Right now!

1754
01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.833
-Go home. you traitor!
-Ma'am. Ma'am.

1755
01:35:43.916 --> 01:35:45.000
-Give it to me!
-Ma'am.

1756
01:35:45.083 --> 01:35:46.166
Careful!

1757
01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:48.166
-Try not to damage your voice!
-Give me that!

1758
01:35:48.250 --> 01:35:49.916
Guess you really fooled me. Alice.

1759
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.916
No. you did this to yourself.
I just said what you wanted to hear.

1760
01:35:59.041 --> 01:36:00.750
Let me guess. You don't hit girls?

1761
01:36:11.708 --> 01:36:13.416
We'll blow up because of your girlfriend!

1762
01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.333
We're gonna blow up because of you. ma'am.

1763
01:36:15.416 --> 01:36:17.333
Hey. hey. hey. No. no. Hey. hey. Now what?

1764
01:36:21.541 --> 01:36:23.083
Hey… Hey. hey! Hey. hey!

1765
01:36:23.166 --> 01:36:24.041
Hey!

1766
01:36:25.541 --> 01:36:27.833
Ousmane! Oh-oh-oh! Stay back. okay?

1767
01:36:27.916 --> 01:36:28.833
Hey. hey. hey!

1768
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:40.083
You can't stop the course of history!

1769
01:36:40.166 --> 01:36:41.583
-You're nothing!
-Okay.

1770
01:36:41.666 --> 01:36:44.583
Hey! I'm willing
to die for the cause. but not here. okay?

1771
01:36:44.666 --> 01:36:46.250
Send me to a mosque or a KFC. Not here.

1772
01:36:46.333 --> 01:36:49.416
I'm not dying in some abandoned
print shop. Ous-- Ousmane!

1773
01:36:50.916 --> 01:36:52.500
-Ousmane!
-That's for me.

1774
01:36:56.333 --> 01:36:57.625
We're not done yet.

1775
01:37:00.416 --> 01:37:02.625
Ousmane!

1776
01:37:06.625 --> 01:37:07.875
Ousmane!

1777
01:37:08.375 --> 01:37:10.916
Ousmane! Ousmane!

1778
01:37:12.041 --> 01:37:14.041
"Yorname"!

1779
01:37:52.833 --> 01:37:53.791
Out of the way!

1780
01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:16.500
Get in.

1781
01:38:32.541 --> 01:38:33.833
-Bullshi-- Oh!
-March!

1782
01:38:35.291 --> 01:38:37.916
Stop! Let me in. you savage!

1783
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.458
After everything we've done for you!
Go back where you came from!

1784
01:38:41.541 --> 01:38:44.500
-Get off! This ain't Uber. lady!
-Terrorist!

1785
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.541
-You're gonna break a hip. woman! Stop it!
-Terrorist!

1786
01:38:55.916 --> 01:38:57.958
Are you nuts?
Shit. they're all over the place!

1787
01:38:58.041 --> 01:39:00.750
This is your stop. Bon voyage!

1788
01:39:16.708 --> 01:39:18.833
Hurry up! Get in.
Come on. come on. come on!

1789
01:39:20.375 --> 01:39:22.000
-Where'd he go?
-I don't know.

1790
01:39:22.083 --> 01:39:24.208
-You didn't see him?
-No. I don't know…

1791
01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:25.666
I was trying to defend myself!

1792
01:39:30.333 --> 01:39:31.500
That way.

1793
01:39:37.041 --> 01:39:38.416
Okay. We'll get him now.

1794
01:39:43.125 --> 01:39:43.958
Gah!

1795
01:39:45.375 --> 01:39:46.291
Come on.

1796
01:39:47.541 --> 01:39:49.250
-You see him?
-No.

1797
01:39:55.541 --> 01:39:57.083
-What was that?
-I don't know.

1798
01:40:02.958 --> 01:40:03.791
Oh shit!

1799
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:13.208
Where is he? Where?

1800
01:40:14.958 --> 01:40:16.625
Yes!

1801
01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:21.666
-Aah!
-Over here!

1802
01:40:33.916 --> 01:40:35.250
-Is he there?
-There!

1803
01:40:37.583 --> 01:40:39.750
Come on! Get him off! Do something!

1804
01:40:40.333 --> 01:40:43.500
I can't see him! I don't know
where he is. You look. I'll drive!

1805
01:40:53.958 --> 01:40:55.125
God damn!

1806
01:40:55.208 --> 01:40:56.833
Oh no… Shit!

1807
01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:30.041
-Where's Alice?
-With Brunner.

1808
01:41:30.125 --> 01:41:32.458
-What?
-Yeah. I'll explain later.

1809
01:41:38.583 --> 01:41:39.666
Do you see them?

1810
01:41:40.333 --> 01:41:41.416
No. We're good.

1811
01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:42.791
We're almost there.

1812
01:41:46.416 --> 01:41:48.083
I knew there was something wrong with her.

1813
01:41:48.583 --> 01:41:49.583
I don't see 'em.

1814
01:41:51.208 --> 01:41:52.291
{\an8}SWITZERLAND

1815
01:41:55.708 --> 01:41:58.125
No. Go to point zero.

1816
01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:09.416
Switzerland!
They're going to Switzerland. Right there!

1817
01:42:27.208 --> 01:42:28.625
That's them.

1818
01:42:29.208 --> 01:42:30.750
-You wearing your seat belt?
-No.

1819
01:42:30.833 --> 01:42:31.666
Buckle up.

1820
01:42:32.208 --> 01:42:34.041
-Why?
-Buckle up.

1821
01:42:37.541 --> 01:42:38.875
I think it's stuck.

1822
01:42:47.708 --> 01:42:49.083
Come on!

1823
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.208
-There!
-They're here!

1824
01:43:14.291 --> 01:43:16.125
Look out! Watch out!

1825
01:43:17.833 --> 01:43:19.375
Look out!

1826
01:43:34.333 --> 01:43:36.458
It's okay. We lost 'em. Speed up.

1827
01:43:43.458 --> 01:43:44.666
There!

1828
01:44:02.791 --> 01:44:05.250
Shit! They're coming down the mountain.
Come on!

1829
01:44:15.625 --> 01:44:17.916
-They're getting closer! Drive faster!
-Shut up!

1830
01:44:20.833 --> 01:44:23.250
Sheep. sheep.
sheep. sheep. sheep!

1831
01:44:24.833 --> 01:44:26.833
-Out the way. assholes!
-They're everywhere.

1832
01:44:26.916 --> 01:44:28.875
Who let the sheep out?

1833
01:44:30.708 --> 01:44:32.458
They're coming! They're coming! Hurry!

1834
01:44:33.541 --> 01:44:36.041
Look out! Hey. hey. hey!

1835
01:44:41.166 --> 01:44:43.000
Look out!

1836
01:44:45.291 --> 01:44:46.541
Whoa! Right there!

1837
01:44:48.291 --> 01:44:49.541
Look out…

1838
01:45:17.875 --> 01:45:18.916
Mmm.

1839
01:45:21.458 --> 01:45:22.708
Come on. Do it.

1840
01:45:22.791 --> 01:45:24.125
NO CONNECTION

1841
01:45:26.416 --> 01:45:28.500
What are you doing. Ousmane?
What are you doing?

1842
01:45:45.541 --> 01:45:47.000
-You okay?
-You insane?

1843
01:45:51.583 --> 01:45:53.958
-What else could I do?
-Anything but that.

1844
01:46:06.791 --> 01:46:08.125
I'll call an ambulance. okay?

1845
01:46:08.208 --> 01:46:09.375
-Okay…
-Don't worry.

1846
01:46:10.666 --> 01:46:12.208
Out of the way!

1847
01:46:19.541 --> 01:46:20.791
Ousmane!

1848
01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:22.583
He's there!

1849
01:46:29.333 --> 01:46:31.666
STARTING COUNTDOWN

1850
01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:36.625
It's done! Just one spark.

1851
01:46:37.333 --> 01:46:38.250
and everything burns!

1852
01:46:38.333 --> 01:46:40.541
ARMED

1853
01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:42.833
We have three minutes!

1854
01:46:46.666 --> 01:46:48.875
-Police!
-Everybody out!

1855
01:46:48.958 --> 01:46:50.791
-Go! Go!
-Come on! Get out!

1856
01:46:50.875 --> 01:46:52.666
There's a bomb! Out!
Get outta here. come on!

1857
01:46:58.125 --> 01:47:00.416
-Out! Get out! Come on!
-Come on! We have to go!

1858
01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:02.125
-Get out! Get out!
-Hey! Hey!

1859
01:47:02.208 --> 01:47:03.458
-What's going on?
-Go!

1860
01:47:07.791 --> 01:47:09.333
Get out! Come on. come on!

1861
01:47:09.416 --> 01:47:11.666
-Come on! Get out!
-Everyone outside! There's a bomb!

1862
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:13.791
There's a bomb!
How do you say "bomb" in African?

1863
01:47:13.875 --> 01:47:16.125
-African?
-South. north. Any African.

1864
01:47:16.208 --> 01:47:19.166
-I'mma check the upper floors.
-Don't! I'll sacrifice myself.

1865
01:47:19.250 --> 01:47:22.166
It won't erase centuries of suffering
my ancestors inflicted--

1866
01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:24.541
-You think this is the time?
-When is it ever the time?

1867
01:47:28.083 --> 01:47:29.791
This way!

1868
01:47:39.083 --> 01:47:40.875
You can't stay here!
There's a bomb.

1869
01:47:40.958 --> 01:47:43.083
Move! Move. please!
Leave the building. please.

1870
01:47:43.166 --> 01:47:45.666
There's a bomb.
Everybody leave the building. please!

1871
01:47:46.166 --> 01:47:47.666
Come on! Get the kids! Hurry up!

1872
01:47:50.083 --> 01:47:51.916
Come on. hurry up. guys.
Get out. get out!

1873
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.750
-Let's go! Come on! Go. go. go!
-A bomb! Hurry!

1874
01:47:54.833 --> 01:47:56.750
-Come on! Hurry! Hey!
-Hey. hey. come on!

1875
01:47:57.541 --> 01:48:00.000
Come on!
Come on. this way! There's a bomb!

1876
01:48:00.916 --> 01:48:03.083
-Get out! Bomb!
-Get out. get out!

1877
01:48:05.625 --> 01:48:08.625
Everybody. leave the building. please.
Out. out! Everybody out!

1878
01:48:08.708 --> 01:48:11.166
Get out. guys. Come on!
We got a bomb! Go on. go!

1879
01:48:22.958 --> 01:48:25.875
-Okay. All good.
-Twenty seconds. We're not gonna make it.

1880
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:29.583
-There. Look!
-No way! That's 60 feet!

1881
01:48:29.666 --> 01:48:31.791
We have to try. Come on! Let's go.

1882
01:48:31.875 --> 01:48:32.958
Run!

1883
01:48:54.208 --> 01:48:55.708
I don't wanna die like this.

1884
01:48:55.791 --> 01:48:57.666
-Not like this. with you!
-What?

1885
01:49:28.083 --> 01:49:29.291
Huh?

1886
01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:49.333
Hey.

1887
01:49:55.166 --> 01:49:56.375
Oh. sorry!

1888
01:49:56.458 --> 01:49:57.875
I'm sorry.

1889
01:49:57.958 --> 01:49:59.375
Sorry.

1890
01:50:00.541 --> 01:50:01.375
Bastard.

1891
01:50:02.041 --> 01:50:03.958
Guess the Sons of Clovis
need a new Führer.

1892
01:50:04.041 --> 01:50:05.250
Come on.

1893
01:50:05.958 --> 01:50:07.041
Or a Führesse.

1894
01:50:09.166 --> 01:50:12.291
That's right.
Führesse. is that a thing?

1895
01:50:12.375 --> 01:50:14.166
Fü-- Führina?

1896
01:50:14.666 --> 01:50:18.208
-Yeah. Führina's good. Führette?
-Führette? Sounds like a rodent.

1897
01:50:18.291 --> 01:50:20.250
Yeah. Führina's better. Cool.

1898
01:50:38.208 --> 01:50:40.916
-What do we tell the higher-ups?
-No idea.

1899
01:50:41.583 --> 01:50:44.458
The case was closed.
so we decided to tour the area.

1900
01:50:44.541 --> 01:50:47.416
Right. When suddenly.
a speeding vehicle blocked our path.

1901
01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:49.916
-Right.
-And then. the call of duty…

1902
01:50:50.416 --> 01:50:53.208
Is stronger than the call of the wild…

1903
01:50:53.291 --> 01:50:55.208
-Right.
-I say we answer.

1904
01:50:55.708 --> 01:50:57.083
This way.

1905
01:51:16.541 --> 01:51:17.708
You okay?

1906
01:51:21.416 --> 01:51:22.916
In a shocking development.

1907
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.833
Antoine Brunner.
leader of the France Vive Party.

1908
01:51:25.916 --> 01:51:29.458
{\an8}has been indicted for ties
to a domestic terrorist organization.

1909
01:51:29.541 --> 01:51:32.125
{\an8}Two brave police officers from Paris

1910
01:51:32.208 --> 01:51:35.375
{\an8}are responsible for foiling
their final plot.

1911
01:51:35.458 --> 01:51:38.750
{\an8}Once again. our police force
has worked tirelessly

1912
01:51:38.833 --> 01:51:40.958
{\an8}to preserve the safety
of all of our citizens.

1913
01:51:41.041 --> 01:51:44.541
{\an8}I'm especially grateful for the brave men
and women of the Paris Criminal Division.

1914
01:51:44.625 --> 01:51:46.583
{\an8}and I'm honored to serve as their leader.

1915
01:51:46.666 --> 01:51:48.958
I'd also like to thank
our Minister of the Interior.

1916
01:51:49.041 --> 01:51:50.875
who has contacted me several times…

1917
01:51:50.958 --> 01:51:53.083
They only interview people
who sit at a desk.

1918
01:51:53.708 --> 01:51:55.583
What's the point.
if no one sees what we do?

1919
01:51:55.666 --> 01:51:56.791
It's frustrating.

1920
01:51:58.750 --> 01:52:00.833
Why did you say
you didn't wanna die with me?

1921
01:52:00.916 --> 01:52:02.916
This might surprise you.
but I don't wanna die.

1922
01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
No. up there. you said.
"I don't wanna die."

1923
01:52:05.083 --> 01:52:06.583
"Not like this. not with you."

1924
01:52:06.666 --> 01:52:08.541
-Why not with me?
-Well. because.

1925
01:52:08.625 --> 01:52:11.083
-"Because" isn't an answer.
-Oh. now "because" isn't an answer?

1926
01:52:11.166 --> 01:52:12.791
-Nope.
-Hmm.

1927
01:52:13.625 --> 01:52:14.791
Why not with me?

1928
01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:16.875
Well. when I said "not with you."

1929
01:52:16.958 --> 01:52:20.041
I meant it more in the sense that
I don't matter because I'm alone.

1930
01:52:20.125 --> 01:52:22.666
It's not a big deal. But you're a father.
You have your son.

1931
01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:24.291
So yeah. "Not with you" meaning

1932
01:52:24.375 --> 01:52:26.333
it wouldn't be fair
for you to die along with me.

1933
01:52:28.375 --> 01:52:29.958
-Why didn't you just say that?
-Listen.

1934
01:52:30.041 --> 01:52:33.125
Everything was falling apart around us.
and it's a long sentence.

1935
01:52:33.208 --> 01:52:36.625
so I gave you the condensed version
of the concept.

1936
01:52:37.541 --> 01:52:40.000
-I call bullshit.
-Fine. go ahead. Don't believe me.

1937
01:52:40.083 --> 01:52:43.583
It's bullshit that you don't matter.
You're a good guy too.

1938
01:52:43.666 --> 01:52:44.916
And you're not alone.

1939
01:52:45.875 --> 01:52:48.250
You have me. And I don't just have Yves.

1940
01:52:48.333 --> 01:52:49.291
I have you.

1941
01:52:50.083 --> 01:52:52.375
-Okay.
-What did you say before?

1942
01:52:53.166 --> 01:52:54.750
A real team? A real duo?

1943
01:52:54.833 --> 01:52:56.916
Are you gonna go through all the synonyms?

1944
01:52:57.833 --> 01:53:00.291
You've been more sentimental
since our night at the hotel.

1945
01:53:02.791 --> 01:53:04.833
You're such a dickhead.

1946
01:53:08.708 --> 01:53:09.666
You're right.

1947
01:53:11.958 --> 01:53:14.291
It'd be nice if people saw
who really does the work.

1948
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.833
You know someone who works in TV?

1949
01:53:18.083 --> 01:53:18.916
Even better.

1950
01:53:23.833 --> 01:53:25.958
MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR
LIBERTY. EQUALITY. FRATERNITY

1951
01:53:28.041 --> 01:53:29.375
Stop! Thief!

1952
01:53:29.458 --> 01:53:30.625
Commitment.

1953
01:53:31.666 --> 01:53:32.541
Discipline.

1954
01:53:35.833 --> 01:53:37.000
Resilience.

1955
01:53:39.083 --> 01:53:40.083
Courage.

1956
01:53:41.250 --> 01:53:42.708
Selflessness.

1957
01:53:47.791 --> 01:53:48.791
Integrity.

1958
01:53:50.416 --> 01:53:51.875
Strength.

1959
01:53:52.833 --> 01:53:54.541
Join the National Police.

1960
01:53:57.875 --> 01:54:00.666
Your adventure starts here.
Recruiting now.

1961
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:02.458
-And cut!
-All right. cut!

1962
01:54:05.625 --> 01:54:08.125
-Check the gate!
-That was good. Perfect! Great!

1963
01:54:08.208 --> 01:54:09.583
That's it. Mark that take. thanks.

1964
01:54:10.916 --> 01:54:13.125
Just perfect! That was beautiful.

1965
01:54:13.208 --> 01:54:14.791
-Really?
-It works for me. Bravo!

1966
01:54:14.875 --> 01:54:17.375
-Can we do one more for me?
-Not sure we have the time.

1967
01:54:17.458 --> 01:54:21.000
-Can we move on to 50-something? Okay!
-I didn't know you were here!

1968
01:54:21.083 --> 01:54:22.291
-You like it?
-Yeah. Not bad.

1969
01:54:22.375 --> 01:54:23.666
I know. right?

1970
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:26.125
They found a body on top
of the Eiffel Tower. You coming?

1971
01:54:26.208 --> 01:54:28.625
I can't. I still have a scene to shoot.
I gotta hit my trailer.

1972
01:54:29.625 --> 01:54:31.208
Sorry. sorry. Of course I'm coming.

1973
01:54:31.291 --> 01:54:33.333
-Just have to take off my makeup.
-Right.

1974
01:54:33.416 --> 01:54:36.833
It's nothing. just a little foundation
and some gloss. Should take five minutes.

1975
01:54:36.916 --> 01:54:39.125
-Some what?
-Gloss. It's skincare for lips.

1976
01:54:39.208 --> 01:54:40.750
-You wear that much?
-Too much?

1977
01:54:40.833 --> 01:54:42.833
-Uh. yeah!
-I have to do another take.

1978
01:54:42.916 --> 01:54:44.416
He's up there!

1979
01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:46.250
Paris Criminal Division!
Freeze!

1980
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:49.791
-How's that?
-Not bad.
