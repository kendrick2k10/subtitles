a crazy dream of mine.

215
00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:40.227

216
00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:43.021
is just to be able
to spend time with my dad.

I know. uh. you know...

218
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.901
I don't know how much longer
I have with him.

219
00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:50.654
And so I resented him a lot for leaving.

220
00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:53.490
and I didn't get to see him
as much growing up...

221
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.450
He didn't understand my zeal.

222
00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:57.702
...So I think this is
making up for lost time.

223
00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:58.620
Singing was...

224
00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.788
I guess I put it ahead of my family...

549
00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:46.184
Well. I had a friend of mine.

550
00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.436
we've been friends for about six years.

551
00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:50.771
and once or twice a year.
we would meet up.

552
00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:52.273
and she called me a month later.

553
00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:54.275
and said she's pregnant.

554
00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:55.568
"So I'm gonna have this baby.

555
00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:56.736
"You don't have to be a part of it.

556
00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:58.279
it's up to you."

557
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.573
I didn't know what to do.

558
00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:01.908
I was freaking out.

559
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:04.619
I was getting anxiety. you know.

560
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.578
You know. I've come from...

561
00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.455
I've had four stepdads.

562
00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:10.208
You know. I've had a dad
that was always on the road.

563
00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:13.252
and I didn't want to have a kid this way.

564
00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:14.587
So I'm gonna be a part of this kid's life

565
00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:16.255
no matter what.

566
00:20:16.256 --> 00:20:19.425
So two weeks ago.
I drove into Hermosa Beach.

567
00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:21.093
It was late at night.

568
00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:23.638
and I was all excited to meet her.

569
00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:26.307
I pulled into the house. and I walked up.

570
00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:29.769
and we just locked eyes.
and it was a magical moment.

571
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.939
My mom passed a few years ago from ALS.

572
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.941
By the fourth day.
I looked into the baby's eyes.

573
00:20:34.942 --> 00:20:38.986
and when she smiles.
it looks just like my mom.

574
00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:40.821
and I almost started crying.

575
00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:42.907
It was just... it was just
the weirdest feeling.

576
00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.825
and it was like...

577
00:20:44.826 --> 00:20:46.577
there she was again.

578
00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.788
and so right then and there.
I just fell in love.

579
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:51.916
Keri. the mother of your baby.

580
00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:55.336
is... is going
to understand

581
00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:58.422
that you have a girlfriend named Cody?

582
00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:01.801
How-how are you going to juggle them then?

583
00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:03.636
Why do I have to juggle anything?

584
00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:04.637
Oh. vacancy!

585
00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:05.930
"Pets welcome."

586
00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:06.931
Let's write this down.

587
00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:08.099
No. we should park here.

588
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.016
and go in. and knock on the door.

589
00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:10.017

Tevie. what's the rent here?

606
00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:32.039

we're still at 99 degrees...

704
00:24:57.871 --> 00:24:59.747
All right. so I've got
a showing in 15 minutes.

705
00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:01.207
This is one of my last listings.

706
00:25:01.208 --> 00:25:04.210
You know. I do love real estate. and I...

707
00:25:04.211 --> 00:25:08.047
I love closing the deals.
the negotiating. and...

708
00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:10.674
and. you know. I love the new homes.

709
00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:13.260
and the architecture. and...

710
00:25:13.261 --> 00:25:15.387
But...

711
00:25:15.388 --> 00:25:19.058
I love singing a lot more.

716
00:25:34.241 --> 00:25:36.784
And the one thing that my dad
worries about the most

717
00:25:36.785 --> 00:25:39.328
is me paying the bills.

718
00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:41.247
You know. he...

719
00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:43.123
I think. you know. he lived a life

720
00:25:43.124 --> 00:25:44.458
where he struggled his whole life.

721
00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:45.709
You know. he'd be rich six months.

722
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.461
and then he's broke six months.

723
00:25:47.462 --> 00:25:48.712
So that's what he's worried about.

724
00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:50.923
Am I going to be able to pay my bills?

725
00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:53.592
And. uh. you know. that's scary.

726
00:25:53.593 --> 00:25:55.594

it's going to work out.
