Priscilla Beaulieu.

I see you come in here a lot.
Is your family stationed here?

32
00:03:42.812 --> 00:03:44.143
Yes.

33
00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:45.846

34
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.645
Uh. Texas.

35
00:03:47.747 --> 00:03:50.387

00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:53.951

Mmm.

39
00:03:56.122 --> 00:03:59.792
I book the entertainment here.
My wife plays here sometimes.

40
00:04:00.765 --> 00:04:02.228
Neat.

41
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.128

45
00:04:12.037 --> 00:04:14.607
He's always glad to see
folks from back home.

We're going this weekend.

You wanna go with strangers
to Elvis Presley's house?

55
00:04:53.512 --> 00:04:55.251
Absolutely not.

56
00:04:55.353 --> 00:04:57.113
There'd be other people
there too.

57
00:04:58.652 --> 00:05:01.024
It's the weekend.
why can't I go?

58
00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:02.523
I'd be with Terry and his wife.

59
00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:04.626
- We don't know them.
- Who are these people?

60
00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:06.892
No.

61
00:05:11.533 --> 00:05:13.129
There's nothing
to do here.

62
00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:22.212
Hello. Captain.
I'm Terry West.

63
00:05:22.314 --> 00:05:24.379
Good to meet you.
This is my wife. Ann.

64
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:26.613
- Hello.
- Hi. I book the music here.

65
00:05:26.716 --> 00:05:29.145
My wife Carol and I
are friends with Elvis.

66
00:05:29.247 --> 00:05:31.747
He's having people over.
Your daughter's welcome to come.

67
00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:33.754
She said I'd have to ask you.

68
00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:35.558
I see.

69
00:05:36.391 --> 00:05:37.524

70
00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:39.359
Stationed under
Sergeant Bryant. sir.

71
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:41.030
- Bryant. huh?
- Yes. sir.

72
00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:42.794
Still tough as nails?

73
00:05:42.897 --> 00:05:45.431
Yes. sir.
If you have any tips...

74
00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:47.237
No. there's no shortcuts. son.

75
00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.038
Well. your daughter'd be
well chaperoned

76
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.200
by my wife and myself.

77
00:05:50.302 --> 00:05:52.474
The house is just off base.
I could pick her up at 8:30

78
00:05:52.576 --> 00:05:54.944
and have her back
by any time you say. sir.

79
00:05:55.046 --> 00:05:56.172
We'll discuss it.

80
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.785
That one's pretty.

81
00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:09.493
It's my Easter dress.
I can't wear this.

82
00:06:10.525 --> 00:06:12.355
I hope you have fun tonight.

83
00:06:13.058 --> 00:06:15.596
I'm sorry it's been so hard
on you here

84
00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.595
but I know you'll make
some new friends soon.

85
00:06:18.697 --> 00:06:20.537
I don't want new friends.

86
00:06:23.303 --> 00:06:24.574
I know.

87
00:06:26.045 --> 00:06:27.610
They'll be here soon.

88
00:06:52.467 --> 00:06:53.830

When I was a kid.
I hit a ball straight at her

so ever since then

155

I really like talking to you.

180
00:12:12.785 --> 00:12:13.989
All right.

181
00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:16.286
We just go up the stairs.

182
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:18.692
it's gonna be
the first door on your right.

183
00:12:18.794 --> 00:12:20.391
I'll meet you up there. okay?

184
00:12:21.298 --> 00:12:22.393
Okay.

185
00:12:23.235 --> 00:12:24.527
All right.

186
00:12:28.704 --> 00:12:30.439
You about ready to go?

187
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:33.239
Soon. Dee.

188
00:13:05.205 --> 00:13:07.075
So. what else is going on
back home?

189
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:13.445
I don't think
things have changed that much.

190
00:13:13.547 --> 00:13:15.149
Hmm.

191
00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:21.188
It's really nice
to talk to someone from home.

192
00:13:22.322 --> 00:13:24.826
And. uh. I know
a lot of girls here and...

193
00:13:24.928 --> 00:13:27.194
And none of them
are from the States.

194
00:13:31.328 --> 00:13:33.398
I wish my mama could've met you.

195
00:13:34.669 --> 00:13:36.539
She. uh...

196
00:13:36.642 --> 00:13:38.403
She passed on just last August.

197
00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:43.243
She would've really liked you.

198
00:13:44.748 --> 00:13:47.410
I wish I could have met her.

199
00:13:47.512 --> 00:13:50.046
She's my whole world.
my mama. and. uh...

200
00:13:50.148 --> 00:13:51.922
I talk to her every day.

201
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.484
And now Dee's got her grips
on my daddy.

202
00:13:55.587 --> 00:13:57.493
He's under her spell.
She's trying to turn him

203
00:13:57.595 --> 00:13:59.590
into something he's not.

204
00:13:59.692 --> 00:14:02.966
I don't know how I'm gonna go
back to Graceland without her.

205
00:14:03.068 --> 00:14:05.067
That's the... That's the home
that I bought for her.

206
00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:08.433
I'm just...

207
00:14:09.772 --> 00:14:11.337
I just really miss her.

208
00:14:16.614 --> 00:14:18.344
I've been so homesick.

209
00:14:21.849 --> 00:14:24.581

We thought it was gonna be
one time.

we have to meet him.

I'll check.

225
00:15:35.826 --> 00:15:37.392

in a few months.

Please don't ruin my life!

229
00:15:43.935 --> 00:15:46.267
Priscilla. don't speak to us
like that.

230
00:15:47.732 --> 00:15:50.667
He just lost his mother
and he's still grieving.

231
00:15:51.542 --> 00:15:52.702
He trusts me.

232
00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:18.133
- Afternoon. sir.
- How are you. son? C'mon in.

233
00:16:18.235 --> 00:16:19.835
That can be tough
this time of year.

234
00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:21.333
No kidding. sir.
We. uh...

235
00:16:21.436 --> 00:16:23.502
We've had some
pretty cold nights out there.

236
00:16:23.604 --> 00:16:25.704
Guess you're looking forward
to getting home?

237
00:16:25.806 --> 00:16:27.706
Yes. sir.

238
00:16:27.808 --> 00:16:29.645
Mmm-hmm.

239
00:16:29.747 --> 00:16:31.708
All right. Here you go.

240
00:16:32.343 --> 00:16:34.577
Well. thank you. ma'am.

241
00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:36.920
Just what is the intent here.
Mr. Presley?

242
00:16:37.022 --> 00:16:38.449
Well. let's face it.
you're Elvis Presley.

243
00:16:38.551 --> 00:16:41.520
You got women
throwing themselves at you.

244
00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:44.193
Why my daughter?

245
00:16:45.659 --> 00:16:48.392
Well. sir. I happen to be
very fond of your daughter.

246
00:16:48.494 --> 00:16:50.693
Uh. she's much more mature
than her age

247
00:16:50.795 --> 00:16:53.598
and I really do enjoy
spending time with her.

248
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.970
I have to admit. you know.
it hasn't been easy for me

249
00:16:57.072 --> 00:16:59.075
being away from home and all.

250
00:16:59.177 --> 00:17:01.377
But you don't have to worry
about her. Captain.

251
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.308
Look. son.

252
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.214
you'll need to
pick her up yourself.

253
00:17:06.176 --> 00:17:07.348

- No.
- Oh. you gotta see it.

279
00:18:24.292 --> 00:18:26.128
There's no one else
like him.

280
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.331

I'm sure you will be.

282
00:18:32.831 --> 00:18:36.900
I wanna study at
The Actors Studio in New York.

283
00:18:37.002 --> 00:18:40.606
and tell stories I can really
put myself into. you know?

284
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.181
Like Brando and James Dean.

285
00:18:45.312 --> 00:18:46.976
Well. I think you'd be great.

286
00:18:51.784 --> 00:18:53.448
I don't even know
if I'll have a music career

287
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.489
- when I get back.
- What?

288
00:18:56.287 --> 00:18:57.590
Sure you will.

289
00:19:00.791 --> 00:19:03.594
Well. I better go.

292
00:19:07.603 --> 00:19:10.438

Oh. good.

324
00:24:04.865 --> 00:24:08.099
Maybe it's time

327
00:24:12.609 --> 00:24:15.974
but he's probably

00:24:16.076 --> 00:24:20.044

Must be some handsome ones.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.167
Come on in. honey.

354
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.371
- Here. let me take your things.
- Thank you.

355
00:26:56.473 --> 00:26:58.572
- Well. you made it!
- Yeah.

356
00:26:58.674 --> 00:27:01.003
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes.

357
00:27:01.105 --> 00:27:03.574
I bet you would like
a lemonade.

358
00:27:05.143 --> 00:27:07.277
And the boys are just
right down there.

359
00:27:09.184 --> 00:27:10.549
Ooh!

360
00:27:10.651 --> 00:27:13.022
That's a good shot.

361
00:27:14.954 --> 00:27:17.392
I see her.
There she is!

362
00:27:17.494 --> 00:27:19.195
Let me get a good look at you.

363
00:27:19.297 --> 00:27:21.993
Hi. Come on. Mmm-mmm.

364
00:27:22.096 --> 00:27:23.895
Where you been all my life?
Let me see you.

365
00:27:23.997 --> 00:27:25.533
Let me see you.
You look beautiful.

366
00:27:25.635 --> 00:27:27.899
Oh. you look beautiful.

367
00:27:28.001 --> 00:27:29.531
- Thank you.
- You gotta meet the guys.

368
00:27:29.633 --> 00:27:32.671
This is Hog Ears. You know Joe.
And then the rest of 'em.

369
00:27:32.774 --> 00:27:35.108
- Nice to see you again.
- Hi.

370
00:27:35.477 --> 00:27:37.179
Jerry. A pleasure.

371
00:27:40.246 --> 00:27:42.413
O-Five. this here is. uh.
this here is Priscilla.

372
00:27:42.515 --> 00:27:43.916
Hello.

373
00:27:44.018 --> 00:27:46.348
Pleased to meet you. honey.
I'm Alberta.

374
00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:48.250
Nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

375
00:27:48.352 --> 00:27:51.725
And we heard plenty about you.

376
00:27:51.827 --> 00:27:55.094
Boys. help yourselves.
Dig in. dig in.

377
00:27:55.861 --> 00:27:57.225
Leave some for Priscilla.

378
00:27:57.327 --> 00:27:59.629
- Hi. You hungry?
- It's beautiful here. No.

379
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:01.331
You like it?

380
00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.742
I keep trying to tell him
to take me shopping.

381
00:28:06.844 --> 00:28:08.844
And he won't
take you shopping?
- Well...

382
00:28:08.946 --> 00:28:11.244
No. I take her.
I just... I just stand there.

383
00:28:11.347 --> 00:28:12.947
You tired?

384
00:28:13.481 --> 00:28:15.214
A little bit.

385
00:28:15.316 --> 00:28:16.719
Hmm.

386
00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:19.184
Why don't you go head upstairs?
I'll meet you.

387
00:28:19.286 --> 00:28:21.821
It's just. uh. it's just
the first door on your left.

388
00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:35.035
Oh. what up? What up?
Oh. this is serious.

389
00:28:35.137 --> 00:28:37.806
- Hey. boss. this is Evelyn.
- Evelyn? Who's Evelyn?

390
00:28:37.908 --> 00:28:40.205
Nice to meet you.

391
00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:43.846
Wow. she's young. huh?

392
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.680
She's like a little girl.

393
00:29:23.284 --> 00:29:25.819
Don't let me sleep
no later than 3:00 tomorrow.

394
00:29:25.921 --> 00:29:27.549
You got it. boss.

395
00:29:31.496 --> 00:29:32.925
Where are you. baby?

396
00:29:33.027 --> 00:29:35.557
I'm here.
I'll be just a few minutes.

397
00:29:36.601 --> 00:29:37.893
All right. Don't take too long.

398
00:29:37.995 --> 00:29:39.869
I wanna see my girl.

399
00:30:10.097 --> 00:30:12.132
You don't know
how much I missed you.

400
00:30:14.435 --> 00:30:17.137
I haven't been able to get you
out of my head since Germany.

401
00:30:21.505 --> 00:30:23.308
You're the one thing
that kept me going.

402
00:30:41.262 --> 00:30:45.094
Wait. hold on. baby.
things can get out of hand.

403
00:30:45.197 --> 00:30:47.334
What? Is there something wrong?

404
00:30:47.436 --> 00:30:48.930
Just...

405
00:30:49.032 --> 00:30:50.632
Just not yet.

406
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.944
There'll be a right time.

407
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:09.318
Here. you can take one of these.

408
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.488
It'll help you sleep
after your trip.

409
00:31:28.346 --> 00:31:29.473
Come here.

410
00:31:43.219 --> 00:31:44.961
Priscilla?

411
00:31:45.528 --> 00:31:46.721
Priscilla?

412
00:31:47.762 --> 00:31:49.593
Priscilla. hon.

413
00:31:49.928 --> 00:31:51.996
It's Grandma.

414
00:31:52.098 --> 00:31:53.429
What did you give this young'un?

415
00:31:53.531 --> 00:31:55.163
You've got no business
givin' her something

416
00:31:55.265 --> 00:31:56.772
that she's not used to.

417
00:31:56.874 --> 00:31:58.904
You know how long
she's been like this?

418
00:31:59.006 --> 00:32:01.043
You need to call the doctor.

419
00:32:02.141 --> 00:32:04.176
I dunno. she's wakin' up.

420
00:32:04.278 --> 00:32:06.609
- I'll get her some water.
Mmm...

421
00:32:07.816 --> 00:32:10.181
- Where am I?
- Hi. baby.

422
00:32:10.283 --> 00:32:12.285
Baby. we've been
trying to wake you up.

423
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:14.749
I just went to bed.

424
00:32:15.926 --> 00:32:18.488
No. baby. you've been out
for two days.

425
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.790
On a goddamn 500 milligram
Placidyl. I... I...

426
00:32:21.892 --> 00:32:24.729
I must have been out of my head
givin' it to you that way.

427
00:32:24.831 --> 00:32:26.497
Mmm. mmm...

428
00:32:27.097 --> 00:32:28.466
Mmm. two days?

429
00:32:32.107 --> 00:32:34.340
Well. that's two days
off my trip.

430
00:32:35.673 --> 00:32:37.513
It's fine. you don't
have to worry about it.

431
00:32:37.615 --> 00:32:39.180
We got plenty of time.

432
00:32:40.247 --> 00:32:42.051
So. how'd you
like to go to Vegas?

433
00:32:44.086 --> 00:32:45.883
- Vegas?

434
00:33:50.954 --> 00:33:53.782
- Twenty-one!

435
00:33:53.884 --> 00:33:57.524
I'm sorry. baby. that's 22.
That's 22. That's a bust.

436
00:33:59.092 --> 00:34:00.894
- Oh.
- Cilla. baby.

437
00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:17.479
- Whoo!
Oh!

438
00:34:20.917 --> 00:34:22.748
Good for you. young lady.

439
00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.450
Whoo!

440
00:35:12.666 --> 00:35:15.432
Baby. I hate to say it.
but our time is up.

441
00:35:15.534 --> 00:35:18.534
No. I'm not going back.

442
00:35:18.636 --> 00:35:20.236
I'll call my parents
and tell them

443
00:35:20.338 --> 00:35:21.637
that I missed the flight.

444
00:35:21.739 --> 00:35:23.773
You really think
they're gonna believe that?

445
00:35:24.574 --> 00:35:26.147
Then I'll tell them the truth.

446
00:35:26.249 --> 00:35:27.843
That I love you
and I'm not going back.

447
00:35:27.945 --> 00:35:31.318
Baby. that's just gonna
make it worse for next time.

448
00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.188
I gotta go do another film.
so. if you go back

449
00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:35.856
and you do well in school
maybe your parents

450
00:35:35.958 --> 00:35:37.556
will let you come back.

451
00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:40.125
Yes. but when?

452
00:35:40.227 --> 00:35:42.191
We'll sort it out. Come here.

453
00:36:01.915 --> 00:36:03.246
What?

454
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:57.468
Why you?

455
00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.334
Why can't he find someone
his own age?

456
00:36:59.436 --> 00:37:01.040
You're only 17.

457
00:37:01.142 --> 00:37:02.971
He's not like you imagine.

458
00:37:04.574 --> 00:37:06.880
And he needs me. Mom!

459
00:37:06.982 --> 00:37:09.015
I won't get hurt.

460
00:37:09.117 --> 00:37:10.978
Please. just talk to Dad.

461
00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.883
I only have a few more
credits left to graduate.

462
00:37:16.189 --> 00:37:17.755
- Please.

463
00:37:20.556 --> 00:37:22.364
All right.

464
00:37:24.935 --> 00:37:26.500
Now help me with these.

465
00:37:27.903 --> 00:37:29.536
<i>Sir.</i>

466
00:37:29.638 --> 00:37:31.766
<i>I promise to enroll her
in a good Catholic school</i>

467
00:37:31.868 --> 00:37:34.637
<i>and I'll make sure
she graduates.</i>

468
00:37:34.739 --> 00:37:36.771
<i>She'll live with my father
and Dee</i>

469
00:37:36.873 --> 00:37:38.806
<i>and have a chaperone
at all times.</i>

470
00:37:38.908 --> 00:37:40.445
- Mmm-hmm <i>.
- And my grandmother</i>

471
00:37:40.547 --> 00:37:43.649
<i>and my cousin Patsy
are here. too.</i>

472
00:37:43.751 --> 00:37:46.014
<i>She'll be looked after
as part of the family here.</i>

473
00:37:47.424 --> 00:37:49.488
<i>I love your daughter
and I can assure you</i>

474
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.324
<i>that my intentions
are honorable. sir.</i>

475
00:37:52.426 --> 00:37:53.925
Well. I appreciate
the call. son.

476
00:37:54.027 --> 00:37:55.623
Bye-bye.

477
00:38:00.999 --> 00:38:02.933
She's gotta forget about him.

478
00:38:03.035 --> 00:38:06.306
And what if she doesn't?
Then she'll never forgive us.

479
00:38:06.408 --> 00:38:08.105
She's gotta finish school.

480
00:38:08.207 --> 00:38:09.510
I know...

481
00:38:10.475 --> 00:38:12.014
But what are we gonna do?

482
00:38:12.116 --> 00:38:13.579
She said
if we don't let her go.

483
00:38:13.681 --> 00:38:15.746
she's going to find a way
to get there on her own.

484
00:38:15.848 --> 00:38:17.782
She's not gonna get there
on her own.

485
00:38:21.891 --> 00:38:23.219
Welcome.

486
00:38:33.562 --> 00:38:34.933
Oh. Priscilla.

487
00:38:35.035 --> 00:38:37.436
Sorry Elvis's shoot's delayed.
He'll be back soon.

488
00:38:37.538 --> 00:38:39.139
I'll take her
for school registration

489
00:38:39.241 --> 00:38:40.538
just as soon as she's settled.

490
00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.073
This girl will be
well looked after.

491
00:38:43.176 --> 00:38:44.743
Thank you.

492
00:38:53.484 --> 00:38:55.050
Please don't worry.

493
00:38:57.487 --> 00:38:58.823
I'll be fine.

494
00:40:11.698 --> 00:40:14.399
Okay. so we'll pick that up
on Friday?

495
00:40:14.502 --> 00:40:16.400
- Oh. hi. Priscilla.
- Hello.

496
00:40:16.502 --> 00:40:18.370
I'm Patsy. this is Becky.

497
00:40:18.472 --> 00:40:20.740
- Hi.
- We run the office here.

498
00:40:20.842 --> 00:40:23.338
It's nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

499
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.907
Us too.

500
00:40:25.009 --> 00:40:27.815
Elvis left a gift for you
on the back patio.

501
00:40:27.917 --> 00:40:29.351
Oh. okay.

502
00:40:29.453 --> 00:40:31.613
You give us a holler
if you need anything.

503
00:40:31.715 --> 00:40:33.580
Okay. thank you. Bye.

504
00:40:37.191 --> 00:40:38.857
Hello!

505
00:40:39.325 --> 00:40:41.530
Who are you? Hi.

506
00:40:42.361 --> 00:40:43.928
Hey. little one!

507
00:40:44.429 --> 00:40:46.029
Happy dog.

508
00:40:52.903 --> 00:40:54.738
<i>How's my girl?</i>

509
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.546
I just can't believe
I'm really here.

510
00:40:58.781 --> 00:41:01.280
<i>Yeah. I only have
a little longer on this shoot</i>

511
00:41:01.382 --> 00:41:02.845
<i>and then I'll be home.</i>

512
00:41:02.947 --> 00:41:04.549
<i>Is everyone
taking good care of you?</i>

513
00:41:04.651 --> 00:41:07.954
Yes. Everyone's been
really nice.

514
00:41:08.057 --> 00:41:10.051
<i>- All right. that's good.</i>
<i>Elvis.
they're ready for you!</i>

515
00:41:10.153 --> 00:41:12.561
<i>All right. baby.
I gotta get back to set.</i>

516
00:41:13.327 --> 00:41:15.663
Okay. I miss you.

517
00:41:16.495 --> 00:41:18.166
<i>Good night. baby.</i>

518
00:41:18.268 --> 00:41:20.129
- Bye.

519
00:41:34.144 --> 00:41:37.144
- Good luck. have a good day.
- Thank you.

520
00:41:37.247 --> 00:41:39.013
Now. you won't be able
to invite anyone over.

521
00:41:39.115 --> 00:41:40.682
Strangers aren't allowed
in Graceland.

522
00:41:42.486 --> 00:41:43.724
Okay.

523
00:41:54.198 --> 00:41:57.100
That's Priscilla.
the girl Elvis is seeing.

524
00:41:59.907 --> 00:42:02.340
And how does friendship
influence who we are

525
00:42:02.442 --> 00:42:04.406
and what we become?

526
00:42:04.508 --> 00:42:06.843

00:42:06.945 --> 00:42:08.749
Remember to cite examples
from the text...

528
00:42:08.851 --> 00:42:11.716
If we make friends with her
maybe we can meet him.

529
00:42:11.818 --> 00:42:13.981
And you will be graded
on penmanship

530
00:42:14.083 --> 00:42:16.290
as well as
spelling and grammar.

531
00:42:33.604 --> 00:42:35.008
Oh. honey.

532
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:38.075
you can't be out here
making a public display
of yourself.

533
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:40.547
Oh. I didn't think it...

534
00:42:40.649 --> 00:42:42.618
Well. you had
better start thinking.

535
00:42:49.553 --> 00:42:50.791
Come on.

536
00:43:22.424 --> 00:43:23.789
<i>How elegant!</i>

537
00:43:23.891 --> 00:43:26.822
<i>The most elegant cake
of all: chiffon.</i>

538
00:43:26.924 --> 00:43:28.761
<i>Now dramatically different.</i>

539
00:43:28.863 --> 00:43:31.266
<i>New and deluxe
vanilla cream chiffon</i>

540
00:43:31.368 --> 00:43:33.328
<i>with an exotic new taste!</i>

541
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:37.904
<i>It's vanilla. cream
and a French flavor secret.</i>

542
00:43:38.471 --> 00:43:40.642
<i>Tantalizing.</i>

543
00:43:40.744 --> 00:43:42.104
<i>I said
to the director today.</i>

544
00:43:42.207 --> 00:43:44.345
<i>"Why'd we come all the way
to Los Angeles</i>

545
00:43:44.448 --> 00:43:45.647
<i>"to film the Smoky Mountains?</i>

546
00:43:45.749 --> 00:43:47.145
<i>"Hell. you may know more
about movie makin'.</i>

547
00:43:47.247 --> 00:43:49.283
<i>"but I know a thing or two
about the Smoky Mountains.</i>

548
00:43:49.385 --> 00:43:50.244
<i>"And I'll tell you what.</i>

549
00:43:50.347 --> 00:43:52.413
<i>"they ain't got no
coconut trees on 'em!"</i>

550
00:43:54.752 --> 00:43:56.355
<i>You there. baby?</i>

551
00:43:56.457 --> 00:43:58.056
Mmm-hmm. I'm here.

552
00:43:58.987 --> 00:44:00.256
<i>How're you doin'?</i>

553
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.792
I'm great.

554
00:44:02.895 --> 00:44:05.333
It's all been really wonderful.

555
00:44:05.435 --> 00:44:07.129
<i>That's what I like to hear.</i>

556
00:44:07.231 --> 00:44:09.233
<i>Baby. do you have
everything you need?</i>

557
00:44:09.702 --> 00:44:11.333
<i>How you doin' on cash?</i>

558
00:44:12.342 --> 00:44:14.441
It's funny you should ask.

559
00:44:14.543 --> 00:44:16.442
Your daddy's pretty strict.

560
00:44:17.979 --> 00:44:20.749
<i>Yeah. that's my daddy.
He's always been tight.</i>

561
00:44:20.851 --> 00:44:23.076
<i>That's why I have him
taking care of the bills.</i>

562
00:44:23.178 --> 00:44:25.620
<i>I don't trust anybody else.</i>

563
00:44:25.723 --> 00:44:27.922
<i>Don't worry about it.
I'll talk to him.</i>

564
00:44:28.024 --> 00:44:31.123
There's a boutique that said
I could work there part-time.

565
00:44:31.225 --> 00:44:34.125
I thought I could work there
a few days a week after school.

566
00:44:36.766 --> 00:44:38.360
<i>Well. you'll have to
forget about that.</i>

567
00:44:39.501 --> 00:44:41.066
I thought it could be fun.

568
00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.135
<i>Well. it's either me
or a career. baby.</i>

569
00:44:45.237 --> 00:44:47.776
<i>When I call you.
I need you to be there for me.</i>

570
00:44:49.409 --> 00:44:50.645
Mmm-hmm.

571
00:44:50.747 --> 00:44:52.748
<i>Just a few more days
and we'll be home.</i>

572
00:44:54.513 --> 00:44:55.817
Okay.

573
00:44:56.879 --> 00:44:59.351
I love you. Bye.

574
00:44:59.453 --> 00:45:00.855
<i>Bye. baby.</i>

575
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:13.227
Memphis. we're back. baby!

576
00:45:13.329 --> 00:45:16.169
It's good to be home!
Where's my Cilla?

577
00:45:16.271 --> 00:45:17.666
Hello.

578
00:45:17.768 --> 00:45:19.703
Hello. Hello.

579
00:45:24.673 --> 00:45:26.842
Dodger. you waited for me too.
Bless your little heart.

580
00:45:26.944 --> 00:45:28.783
I did. Welcome home. baby.

581
00:45:28.885 --> 00:45:30.944
Good to see you. baby.
O-Five. what's for dinner?

582
00:45:32.883 --> 00:45:34.284
Cilla. come here.

583
00:45:35.918 --> 00:45:37.254
How's school?

584
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.321
Oh. it's okay.

585
00:45:39.423 --> 00:45:42.090
- I don't really talk
to anybody there.
- Hmm.

586
00:45:42.192 --> 00:45:44.195
Grandma and Patsy
have been nice.

587
00:45:44.729 --> 00:45:46.329
I missed you.

588
00:45:47.464 --> 00:45:49.637
I've been trying to
find things to do with my...

589
00:45:49.739 --> 00:45:51.365
You gotta keep up
with your schoolwork

590
00:45:51.467 --> 00:45:53.435
otherwise your father
won't let you stay.

591
00:45:54.778 --> 00:45:57.439
- I know. but...
- You sure do look pretty.

592
00:45:58.373 --> 00:46:00.145
C'mon. let's have
something to eat.

593
00:46:03.049 --> 00:46:04.748
O-Five. I sure did
miss you. baby!

594
00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:06.418
Let me see you.

595
00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.816
Hand me a plate.

596
00:46:09.454 --> 00:46:11.626
I'll tell you.
that Ursula was always around.

597
00:46:11.728 --> 00:46:13.856
Oh. goddamn man.
she was a big woman.

598
00:46:13.958 --> 00:46:15.422
- She was.

599
00:46:15.524 --> 00:46:18.127
- Was she pretty?
- She had a body like a man.

600
00:46:18.229 --> 00:46:19.868
No hips.
shoulders broader than mine.

601
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:22.664
Goddamn. I was scared to
take my shirt off next to her.

602
00:46:23.905 --> 00:46:25.773
But. E.
she only had eyes for you.

603
00:46:25.875 --> 00:46:27.808
No way. man.
not with that John Derek

604
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.572
just lurking around
with them beady eyes.

605
00:46:32.408 --> 00:46:35.246
Probably snores like a man.

606
00:46:35.348 --> 00:46:37.677
God. I tell you. man.
I can't stand that guy.

607
00:46:37.779 --> 00:46:40.453
What's that guy. 5'7"?
God. five-nothing.

608
00:46:40.555 --> 00:46:42.189
Five foot-nothing.

609
00:46:53.102 --> 00:46:55.462
Why are you taking those now?
You'll fall asleep.

610
00:46:55.564 --> 00:46:57.598
It'll take a while
for 'em to take effect.

611
00:47:08.681 --> 00:47:10.083
How's my girl?

612
00:47:12.887 --> 00:47:14.582
I'm just so happy
you're back.

613
00:47:32.636 --> 00:47:35.438
Baby. don't... Don't... Don't...
Don't get carried away.

614
00:47:37.409 --> 00:47:40.146
You gotta let me decide
when we take this moment.

615
00:47:41.818 --> 00:47:43.919
It's just this is
very sacred to me.

616
00:47:47.017 --> 00:47:49.086
What about Anita?

617
00:47:49.188 --> 00:47:50.724
You mean you didn't
make love to her

618
00:47:50.826 --> 00:47:52.222
the whole time
you were together?

619
00:47:52.324 --> 00:47:55.325
That was different.
I mean. she was older.

620
00:47:55.427 --> 00:47:57.091
That's just... That's just
the way that I feel.

621
00:47:57.193 --> 00:47:59.000
What about how I feel?

622
00:48:00.132 --> 00:48:02.036
That's asking a lot of someone.

623
00:48:03.302 --> 00:48:05.369
It doesn't mean
we can't do other things.

624
00:48:17.546 --> 00:48:19.083
Hop in.
I wanna take you shopping.

625
00:48:27.123 --> 00:48:28.455
Come on. Come on.

626
00:48:40.107 --> 00:48:41.941
Well. would you
look at that. huh?

627
00:48:42.043 --> 00:48:43.605
Yeah!

628
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:48.182
I think these clothes
are too sophisticated for me.

629
00:48:48.284 --> 00:48:51.047
Honey. what's sophisticated?
You could go around in a feather

630
00:48:51.149 --> 00:48:52.480
and it'll be sophisticated.

631
00:48:52.582 --> 00:48:55.190
- Yeah. that's right.

632
00:48:59.025 --> 00:49:00.594
Yeah. how many we got?

633
00:49:03.832 --> 00:49:05.861
Oh...
Wow!

634
00:49:05.963 --> 00:49:07.431
Oh-ho-ho.

635
00:49:07.533 --> 00:49:10.069
- We have a winner right there!
Absolutely.

636
00:49:10.171 --> 00:49:12.766
I like you in blue. yeah.
Blue's your color.

637
00:49:22.452 --> 00:49:23.513
Oh. I like that.

638
00:49:25.614 --> 00:49:27.655
Prints take away
from your looks.

639
00:49:27.757 --> 00:49:29.220
Oh. it's like a forest.

640
00:49:29.323 --> 00:49:31.387
- I like this one.
- No. solids suit you better.

641
00:49:31.489 --> 00:49:34.458
And I hate brown.
It reminds me of the army.

642
00:49:41.997 --> 00:49:45.403
All right. the car's outside.
You got his in there too. right?

643
00:49:52.278 --> 00:49:55.982
Hmm... Black hair
and more eye makeup

644
00:49:56.084 --> 00:49:58.086
will make your eyes
stand out more.

645
00:49:58.987 --> 00:50:00.347
- Mmm-hmm.
It's 4:00. boys.

646
00:50:00.449 --> 00:50:02.116
We gotta go. barbecue's waiting.

647
00:50:02.218 --> 00:50:04.086
Come on.

648
00:50:04.188 --> 00:50:05.726
Come on. boys.

649
00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.728
Go. go. go!

650
00:51:35.782 --> 00:51:37.350
Mmm...

651
00:51:53.831 --> 00:51:55.902
I can't believe
she dyed her hair!

652
00:51:56.004 --> 00:51:57.570
Did she dye it just for him?

653
00:51:57.672 --> 00:51:58.767
Probably.

654
00:52:00.004 --> 00:52:01.275
Hello.

655
00:52:02.944 --> 00:52:04.443
What time is it?

656
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:06.979
Almost 4:00.

657
00:52:07.081 --> 00:52:08.678
I brought breakfast for you.

658
00:52:11.314 --> 00:52:12.812
I got this for you.

659
00:52:15.618 --> 00:52:17.423
- Thank you!

660
00:52:18.223 --> 00:52:19.788
- Right there?
- Okay.

661
00:52:20.729 --> 00:52:22.296
All right.

662
00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.296
Very nice.

663
00:52:25.398 --> 00:52:27.466
A natural.

664
00:52:30.805 --> 00:52:31.932

Hello.

679
00:54:23.084 --> 00:54:24.715
Now. what is that dress?

680
00:54:26.517 --> 00:54:28.686
Uh. that doesn't suit you. baby.

681
00:54:30.293 --> 00:54:33.557
- It doesn't?
- No. it does nothin' for you.

682
00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.859
Takes away from your eyes
and from your face.

683
00:54:36.961 --> 00:54:39.166
Oh. man. it does nothing
for your figure. All you see

684
00:54:39.268 --> 00:54:40.902
- is a goddamn dress.
- You finished?

685
00:54:41.004 --> 00:54:42.566
Satnin. you're a small girl.

686
00:54:42.668 --> 00:54:44.732
You gotta keep away
from the prints. baby!

687
00:54:44.834 --> 00:54:47.172
Okay. I'll return
the fucking dress!

688
00:54:56.585 --> 00:54:58.746
Priscilla. final exams
are coming up.

689
00:54:58.848 --> 00:55:00.583
You will need to
keep your grades up

690
00:55:00.685 --> 00:55:02.753
in order to graduate
with your class.

691
00:55:03.618 --> 00:55:05.118
Yes. Sister Adrian.

692
00:55:10.663 --> 00:55:13.367
Dad. I'm doing great.
You don't have to...

693

we want you to graduate?</i>

Yes. I will graduate.
Don't worry.

Maybe you could wait
outside the ceremony.

telling me how to record.

907
01:13:43.411 --> 01:13:46.244

RCA wants it to sound.

908
01:13:46.346 --> 01:13:47.644
I don't wanna record up front.

909
01:13:47.747 --> 01:13:49.475
I wanna do it the way
that I always done it.

910

911
01:13:54.421 --> 01:13:56.248

01:25:39.091 --> 01:25:40.990
G-7. G-7. you gotta pick it.

1043
01:25:41.092 --> 01:25:43.229
G-7. What's a "beatle"?

1044
01:25:43.331 --> 01:25:46.599
You're a goddamn beetle.
I tell you. crawling around.

1045
01:25:46.701 --> 01:25:47.859
You little freak.

1046
01:25:47.961 --> 01:25:50.830
I wanna play J-8.
You're a Patsy Cline guy. no?

1047
01:25:50.932 --> 01:25:52.630
Don't tell me to play
goddamn Beatles in my house.

1048
01:25:52.732 --> 01:25:54.840
We're in America.
I swear to God.

1049
01:25:54.943 --> 01:25:56.904
Fantastic.

1050
01:25:57.007 --> 01:25:58.406
Thank you.

1051
01:26:01.210 --> 01:26:02.779
All right!

1052
01:26:24.633 --> 01:26:27.002
- Not enough zippers.

1053
01:26:27.104 --> 01:26:28.733
We can get more...

1054
01:26:28.835 --> 01:26:31.104
You could put a parachute
around the back.

1055
01:26:34.341 --> 01:26:35.941
How'd it go?

1056
01:26:40.018 --> 01:26:42.387
- Well?

1057
01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:48.857
I... I...
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna be a daddy?

1058
01:26:48.959 --> 01:26:50.461
Mmm-hmm.

1059
01:26:52.366 --> 01:26:54.294
Get Vernon on the phone.
you tell him he's gonna be

1060
01:26:54.396 --> 01:26:55.965
a grey-headed granddaddy.

1061
01:26:57.732 --> 01:26:59.969
Sir. can you make
a little tiny one now?

1062
01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:05.342
Oh. what is it. Satnin?

1063
01:27:05.445 --> 01:27:07.346
What happened
to that twinkle in your eyes?

1064
01:27:08.144 --> 01:27:09.510
I'm scared.

1065
01:27:09.612 --> 01:27:12.611
Whatever you wanna do.
I'll back you up.

1066
01:27:12.713 --> 01:27:16.355
I want a baby.
It's just so soon.

1067
01:27:18.823 --> 01:27:23.557
What about our trip to Europe
and all of our plans together?

1068
01:27:23.659 --> 01:27:25.529
It's all right.
We'll go another time.

1069
01:27:27.031 --> 01:27:28.600
Come here.

1070
01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:30.303
Okay.

1071
01:27:32.236 --> 01:27:33.801
We're having a little one.

1072
01:28:34.595 --> 01:28:36.802
Cilla!
- Yes?

1073
01:28:36.904 --> 01:28:38.503
Cilla. come here.

1074
01:28:45.745 --> 01:28:47.105
Yes?

1075
01:28:48.049 --> 01:28:49.613
Cilla. I've been thinking...

1076
01:28:50.912 --> 01:28:55.388
You know. I have to have
time to think and...

1077
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:58.589
Things just haven't been right.
you know. and I...

1078
01:28:59.623 --> 01:29:01.719
I think it'd be best
for the two of us

1079
01:29:01.822 --> 01:29:03.924
if we took a little time apart.

1080
01:29:07.398 --> 01:29:08.995
What are you talking about?

1081
01:29:13.507 --> 01:29:15.905
- What did I do?
- Oh. baby. you don't see...

1082
01:29:16.007 --> 01:29:20.379
Well. you didn't do anything.
It's not you. It's just that...

1083
01:29:20.481 --> 01:29:23.548
I've been going through
some things and I just...

1084
01:29:26.081 --> 01:29:28.520
I just think it'd be best
if we took a little break.

1085
01:29:33.355 --> 01:29:34.922
You've got it.

1086
01:29:35.855 --> 01:29:37.661
Just tell me when to leave.

1087
01:29:48.338 --> 01:29:49.769
Oh. wait. baby!

1088
01:29:49.871 --> 01:29:51.906
I don't mean it. Cilla.
Don't leave.

1089
01:29:53.611 --> 01:29:55.741
Go. go!
Come on. come on!

1090
01:29:55.843 --> 01:29:57.916
Oh. my God!
Yeah!

1091
01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.777
Elvis?

1092
01:30:28.981 --> 01:30:30.549
Elvis?

1093
01:30:31.417 --> 01:30:34.884
Hey. wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

1094
01:30:34.986 --> 01:30:36.555
Huh?

1095
01:30:37.056 --> 01:30:38.888
Baby's coming.

1096
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:40.659
Oh.

1097
01:30:40.961 --> 01:30:42.928
Are you sure?

1098
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:44.563
- Yes.
- Oh...

1099
01:30:47.494 --> 01:30:48.930
Oh...

1100
01:30:50.230 --> 01:30:53.972
Daddy. it's time.
You need to send a car up. okay?

1101
01:30:55.704 --> 01:30:58.877
Oh.

1103
01:31:00.446 --> 01:31:01.842
Who put this
fuckin' table there?

1104
01:31:01.945 --> 01:31:03.642
Jerry! Jerry. it's time
to send the car up!

1105
01:31:03.744 --> 01:31:05.316
Cilla's having the baby!

1106
01:31:05.418 --> 01:31:06.915
We're on it!
We're going!

1107
01:31:07.017 --> 01:31:10.221
Where's my daddy?

1108
01:31:13.724 --> 01:31:15.991
Do you want to
call the Colonel?

1109
01:31:42.689 --> 01:31:44.148
You okay. sweetheart?

1110
01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:46.121
Mmm-hmm.
I'll get her.

1111

We sure do.

1115
01:32:13.616 --> 01:32:15.449

1117
01:33:24.886 --> 01:33:27.418

wanna hurt you. baby.

1119
01:33:32.364 --> 01:33:33.963
Well. I'm okay.

1120
01:33:36.567 --> 01:33:38.132
Let's just wait a little.

1121
01:33:55.448 --> 01:33:58.350
- Hi. sweetie.

1122
01:33:59.856 --> 01:34:01.760
- She's ready for her nap.
- Okay.

1123

1124
01:34:14.308 --> 01:34:15.936

01:40:33.749 --> 01:40:35.420
Six.

1216
01:40:35.522 --> 01:40:37.089
Seven. eight.

1217
01:40:38.156 --> 01:40:39.683
Up a bit higher.
Up here. all right?

1218
01:40:39.785 --> 01:40:42.127
A good strong angle
for your arm. okay?

1219
01:40:42.759 --> 01:40:44.360
Good boy.

1220
01:40:47.927 --> 01:40:50.560
What was it? The third <i>ka</i> ...
What was it called?

1221
01:40:50.662 --> 01:40:52.431
<i>- Heian Yondan.
- Heian Yondan.</i>

1222
01:40:52.533 --> 01:40:54.333
- The fourth <i>kata.</i>
- The fourth <i>kata.</i>

1223
01:40:54.435 --> 01:40:57.172
- Fourth. Close.
- And I. um...

1224
01:40:57.274 --> 01:40:58.635
I guess I'm getting
a little too good

1225
01:40:58.737 --> 01:41:01.606
and I punched him
straight in the nose.

1226
01:41:01.708 --> 01:41:04.215
My memory's a little blurry
because. um...

1227
01:41:04.317 --> 01:41:07.479
You might've shaken something
a bit loose. but... No.

1228
01:41:07.581 --> 01:41:09.950
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine. It's fine.

1229
01:42:46.852 --> 01:42:48.451
Mommy!

1230
01:42:52.185 --> 01:42:54.153
It broke.

1231
01:42:54.255 --> 01:42:55.826
I can't believe it.

1232
01:42:55.928 --> 01:42:57.161
Excuse me. Mrs. Presley.

1233
01:42:57.264 --> 01:42:59.597
Elvis asked that you meet him
in the suite.

1234
01:42:59.699 --> 01:43:01.233
Okay. thank you.

1235
01:43:02.531 --> 01:43:05.535
He never goes to his room
between shows.

1236
01:43:05.637 --> 01:43:08.202
Um. I'm gonna go see what's up
and I'll meet you guys after.

1237
01:43:08.304 --> 01:43:09.972
- Okay.
- Okay. see you then.

1238
01:43:10.074 --> 01:43:11.775
And then what happened?

1239
01:43:11.877 --> 01:43:13.608
Everything smashed.

1240
01:43:29.161 --> 01:43:30.727
- Hello?

1241
01:43:34.897 --> 01:43:36.466
Hey.

1242
01:43:39.037 --> 01:43:40.635
Hey. is everything okay?

1243
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:43.671
Cilla.

1244
01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:53.444
Shh. I wanna show you
how a real man

1245
01:43:53.546 --> 01:43:55.084
makes love to his woman.

1246
01:43:55.186 --> 01:43:57.184
Oh! What are you doing? Oh!

1247
01:43:57.286 --> 01:43:59.423
Please. stop! Just stop!

1248
01:44:00.022 --> 01:44:01.590
Stop.

1249
01:44:36.730 --> 01:44:37.692
I'm leaving.

1250
01:44:40.396 --> 01:44:41.993
What do you mean. "leaving"?

1251
01:44:46.170 --> 01:44:47.735
I'm leaving our marriage.

1252
01:44:52.638 --> 01:44:54.445
Are you out of your mind?

1253
01:44:55.909 --> 01:44:58.548
You have everything
a woman could want.

1254
01:45:00.418 --> 01:45:02.783
You don't mean that. Satnin.
You can't.

1255
01:45:04.557 --> 01:45:06.952
You mean I've been so blind
I didn't see this coming?

1256
01:45:08.259 --> 01:45:10.054
We're living separate lives.

1257
01:45:14.398 --> 01:45:16.764
Have I lost you to another man?

1258
01:45:18.766 --> 01:45:21.131
You're losing me
to a life of my own.

1259
01:45:30.314 --> 01:45:32.516
I have to go.

1260
01:45:36.155 --> 01:45:37.987
If I stay. I'll never leave.

1261
01:45:41.492 --> 01:45:44.055
Maybe another place.
another time.

1262
01:47:03.636 --> 01:47:05.477
Kiss Lisa for me.

1263
01:47:07.276 --> 01:47:08.843
