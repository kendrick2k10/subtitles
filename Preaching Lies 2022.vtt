You're right.

731
00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:04.349
I promise I'll make it up to you.

732
00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:05.583
- Mm-hmm.

733
00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:06.518
- I have to go do the Lord's work.

734
00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:07.719
That's what I call to do.

735
00:28:07.719 --> 00:28:10.321
- But daddy. your first ministry is at home

736
00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:12.223
and you're hardly here.

737
00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:14.826
- Ouch.

738
00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:15.960
(Hosea chuckling) - [Haven] Ouch.

739
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.362
- Using my own teachings against me.

740
00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:18.830
- [Haven] Hm.

741
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.732
- I guess you have been paying attention in church.

742
00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:21.933
- Have I. now?

743
00:28:21.933 --> 00:28:22.767
- Uh.

744
00:28:23.668 --> 00:28:25.336
How about this?

745
00:28:25.336 --> 00:28:26.805
After this weekend.

746
00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:28.373
I'll take some time off

747
00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:30.809
and the three of us can hang out.

748
00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:31.810
- The three of us?

749
00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.279
- Yeah. you. me. Shaunie.

750
00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:35.613
- I'll pass.

751
00:28:35.613 --> 00:28:36.548
- Come on now.

752
00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:37.415
Why you gotta pass. baby?

753
00:28:37.415 --> 00:28:38.349
- I'll pass you.

754
00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:40.685
You go on to your ministry. dad.

755
00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:44.923
I'll see. when you get back. safe travels.

756
00:28:44.923 --> 00:28:48.426
Will you be back tomorrow or whenever?

757
00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:49.360
It doesn't matter.

758
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.695
Love you.

759
00:28:50.695 --> 00:28:52.864
- I love you too. - mm-hmm.

760
00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:55.700
- Father. son.

761
00:28:56.668 --> 00:28:59.170
Holy ghost. (both laughing)

762
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.405
All right.

763
00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:01.840
Look when I get back. I'll take you shopping.

764
00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.141
All right? - Mm-hmm.

765
00:29:03.141 --> 00:29:04.042
- All right?

766
00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:05.043
Praise the Lord.

767
00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:06.177
- Hallelujah. - Hallelujah.

768
00:29:06.177 --> 00:29:07.011
Let's go.

769
00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:19.224
(slow melodic music)

770
00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:23.561
(door knocking)

771
00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:24.963
- [Haven] Coming!

772
00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:33.438
- Hey. best friend! - Hey. girl!

773
00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:38.143
(door knocking) (Asa speaking faintly)

774
00:29:38.143 --> 00:29:39.344
- [Fangaz] It was you. bruh.

775
00:29:39.344 --> 00:29:40.278
Should have left your ass in the car.

776
00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:43.848
(door knocking repeatedly)

777
00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:48.620
(knocking continues)

778
00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.488
- Nice house.

779
00:29:50.488 --> 00:29:52.657
- Girl. I can smell that chicken all the way out here.

780
00:29:52.657 --> 00:29:53.925
- Uh-uh.

781
00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:55.293
- What is this?

782
00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:56.528
- What?

783
00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:57.595
You too good to let a nigga up in your house?

784
00:29:57.595 --> 00:29:58.863
- Aye. bruh. don't. - What?

785
00:29:58.863 --> 00:29:59.697
- Don't do that.

786
00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:00.865
- Listen little ugly.

787
00:30:00.865 --> 00:30:01.800
It ain't got nothing to do with me

788
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.934
being better than anybody.

789
00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:04.169
It's a simple fact that

790
00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:05.603
my dad don't even play these type of games

791
00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:07.105
and Mila.

792
00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:09.374
you know what would happen if he came back here right now.

793
00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:11.342
- Girl. that's not gonna happen.

794
00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:13.711
The last thing your daddy gonna do is come back here

795
00:30:13.711 --> 00:30:16.214
with Shaunie in the car. (Haven scoff)

796
00:30:16.214 --> 00:30:17.816
- What do you mean with Shaunie in the car?

797
00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:20.051
My daddy went to go do ministry.

798
00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:21.586
- Ministry?

799
00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:23.421
Is that what they callin' sneaky linkin' these days?

800
00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:27.225
'Cause our show did see them get on I-75 on my way here.

801
00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:28.459
- Yeah. we did.

802
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.365
- Okay. come on. y'all.

803
00:30:34.365 --> 00:30:35.767
Hey. best friend. - Hm. best friend.

804
00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:37.802
- Smell like chicken. mm.

805
00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:40.705
- Hey. you. (smooth jazz music)

806
00:30:40.705 --> 00:30:41.573
- Hey. you.

807
00:30:42.473 --> 00:30:43.575
- Good to see you.

808
00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:44.375
- It is.

809
00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.747
- It's nice place you got.

810
00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:50.715
- Thank you.

811
00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:55.954
- After you.

812
00:30:57.455 --> 00:30:58.456
(Haven sighs)

813
00:30:58.456 --> 00:30:59.524
- The chicken. - Man. that shit

814
00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:00.692
better be good. the way you keep

815
00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:03.995
talking about it. - It is! I promise you.

816
00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:08.233
- What is wrong with you?

817
00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:09.667
- What?

818
00:31:09.667 --> 00:31:11.069
- Why you bringing these strange men up in my house. Mila?

819
00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:12.937
You know. we don't get down like that.

820
00:31:12.937 --> 00:31:14.239
- [Mila] They're cool people.

821
00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:15.540
- [Haven] Says who?

822
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.575
- I've been talking to Fangaz for weeks.

823
00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:18.509
- So.

824
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:20.078
- He's cool and so is Trouble.

825
00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:22.146
He asked about you the other day?

826
00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:23.781
- No. he did not.

827
00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:25.083
That man doesn't know much about me from

828
00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:27.418
the conversation we had three weeks ago.

829
00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:29.020
- He did too.

830
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.389
And judging by that smile you're trying to hide

831
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:32.991
I can tell you glad about it.

832
00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:33.858
(Haven mocking Mila)

833
00:31:33.858 --> 00:31:34.692
Mm-hmm.

834
00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:37.829
- Oo. - Okay.

835
00:31:37.829 --> 00:31:41.833
So y'all can take a seat at the island.

836
00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:44.535
I didn't know that we were having extra company.

837
00:31:44.535 --> 00:31:48.740
but there should be enough for everybody.

838
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.074
- Yeah.

839
00:31:50.074 --> 00:31:52.410
- Ooh. - You know. you know.

840
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:53.444
- You not even like that. bro.

841
00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:54.746
- Right? He's faking.

842
00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:55.713
- [Mila] Don't to him.

843
00:31:55.713 --> 00:31:56.848
- Bruh. stop playing me. bruh.

844
00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:58.616
- I've been teaching him. okay?

845
00:31:58.616 --> 00:31:59.984
- [Haven] Mm. I know a phony when I see one.

846
00:31:59.984 --> 00:32:00.752
- A real gentleman.

847
00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:02.353
Chivalry.

848
00:32:02.353 --> 00:32:03.788
- Spell chivalry. (Haven laughing)

849
00:32:03.788 --> 00:32:05.023
- [Haven] Spell it. Spell it!

850
00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:08.426
- C-H-ilvery. (group laughing)

851
00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:09.928
- Shut up.

852
00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:10.895
- [Haven] I'm surprised you got the first two. right?

853
00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:12.096
- Oh whatever. (girls laughing)

854
00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:13.464
- Makes my life. I ain't gonna hold you.

855
00:32:13.464 --> 00:32:14.565
- [Mila] Mm-hmm.

856
00:32:14.565 --> 00:32:16.701
- You got some hot sauce. right?

857
00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:18.403
- Yes. - [Fangaz] Okay. let's go.

858
00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:19.404
- You don't see the color of my skin?

859
00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:20.638
Of course we got hot sauce.

860
00:32:20.638 --> 00:32:21.306
- [Asa] Say that. - Just checkin'.

(Haven laughing)

863
00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:25.443
- You not even gonna need it.

864
00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:27.645
- Oh. it's that good? - Mm-hmm.

865
00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:28.546

I just feel it. (plate hits countertop)

869
00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:34.919
(Asa laughing)

870
00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:37.555
- [Asa] God damn. - [Haven] You're welcome.

871
00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:39.824

881
00:32:58.776 --> 00:32:59.610
- It's missing something.

882
00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:00.578
- Mm. okay.

883
00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:02.747

(Haven laughing)

891
00:33:21.132 --> 00:33:22.300
- Stop doing that.

892
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.568
- Doing what?

893
00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:25.470
- Pulling on your clothes.

894
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:26.671
- I'm not.

895
00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:27.505
- You are.

896
00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:33.311
Why you got that kiddie portion of food on your plate?

897
00:33:33.311 --> 00:33:36.547
- I'm just not that hungry. that's all.

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:43.588
- I'm gonna break you out of that shell.

899
00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:44.922
Sooner or later.

900
00:33:53.664 --> 00:33:54.999
- Can I get some hot sauce or something?

901
00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:55.867
What?

902
00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:57.001

Would you like something to drink too?

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:04.008
- You don't need it.

908
00:34:04.008 --> 00:34:05.877

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.416
see us all sitting out eating all this nice ass shit

912
00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:13.217
and the only person that you gonna offer something to drink

913
00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:14.385
is this fool?

914
00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:15.653
- [Asa] Bruh.

915
00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:16.854
For real?

916
00:34:16.854 --> 00:34:20.291
- First of all. don't cuss in my house.

917
00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:21.626
Secondly.

918
00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:23.127
the reason why I didn't ask you

919
00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:25.163
is because we don't have enough Proactive cocktail

920
00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:26.564
to clean up that face of yours

921
00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.099
from the inside and out so. (all laughing)

922
00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:29.500
- [Asa] God damn.

923
00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:31.869
- Okay.

924
00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:34.372
I told you to stop coming from my boo like that.

925
00:34:34.372 --> 00:34:36.140
- (chuckling) And now see that's why

926
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.742
she gonna be my baby mama.

927
00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.577
Keep on taking up for me like that. girl.

928
00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:41.145
Keep it up. keep it up. now.

929
00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:42.580
- This guy.

930
00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.615
- [Haven] I hope you were gonna get one from overseas. Mi.

931
00:34:44.615 --> 00:34:45.783
- Get what from overseas?

932
00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:47.251
- A baby.

933
00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:48.319
Because you having one with that one right there

934
00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:52.723
is not the move. (all laughing)

935
00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:53.991
- [Asa] Pull up.

936
00:34:53.991 --> 00:34:56.027
- (laughing) It's funny.

937
00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:59.030
- Shut your fat ass up. bitch!

938
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.131
- Say. bruh.

939
00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:01.065
- What?

940
00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:02.033
- Now. you can't do that.

941
00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:02.967
- What?

942
00:35:02.967 --> 00:35:04.202
- What you not about to do

943
00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:06.437
is come for that one right there.

944
00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.272
- So you taking up her? - Yeah!

945
00:35:08.272 --> 00:35:09.507
- All right.

946
00:35:09.507 --> 00:35:11.042
- This right here is a lifetime bond.

947
00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:12.877
You just got here.

948
00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:15.146
You not about to come from my sister.

949
00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:16.414
- All right.

950
00:35:16.414 --> 00:35:18.349
- I'm gonna go. - Haven.

951
00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:21.586
Bruh. you see that?

952
00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:23.121
That's some foul shit. bruh.

953
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:24.722
- What. bruh?

954
00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:26.290
- Call her a bitch in her house.

955
00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.358
- You on her side. too?

956
00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:28.793
- Definitely.

957
00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:29.927
- Nigga. we were supposed to be boys. though.

958
00:35:29.927 --> 00:35:31.462
(Mila sucks teeth) - We boys.

959
00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:34.599
We are boys but that's why I can tell you why you wrong.

960
00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:36.200
That shit a foul. bruh.

961
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.668
- Let me go check on her.

962
00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:38.836
- Nah. let me.

963
00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:43.074
- Second door to the left.

964
00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:44.809
- Captain save a. hmm.

965
00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:47.478
- [Asa] Get your mans. - Shut up.

966
00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.681
- We gonna talk. - Why don't you say that?

967
00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:53.784
- Because she ain't gimme no hot sauce and I'm still upset.

968
00:35:53.784 --> 00:35:54.619
What?

969
00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.489
- I wanna see you. (lofi music)

970
00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:01.926
(Haven faintly praying through tears)

971
00:36:01.926 --> 00:36:04.762
God. let me know that you're here.

972
00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:08.799
(crying)

973
00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:11.903
- Hey. hey.

974
00:36:13.604 --> 00:36:15.606
Hey. hey. shh.

975
00:36:15.606 --> 00:36:17.341
Come here. shh.

976
00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:18.176
It's okay.

977
00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:20.778
It's okay. it's okay.

978
00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:22.547
Relax.

979
00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:26.050
Relax.

980
00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:27.485
(breathing heavily) (Asa shushing)

981
00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:30.288
(whispering faintly)

982
00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:32.023
Come on. breathe with me. breathe with me.

983
00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.124
Breathe with me.

984
00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:34.425
Breathe with me.

985
00:36:34.425 --> 00:36:36.961
(both taking deep breathes)

986
00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:37.795
Come on.

987
00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:42.934
He. he gonna be him.

988
00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:44.068
He ain't mean it.

989
00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:45.403
He didn't mean it.

990
00:36:45.403 --> 00:36:46.237
- Yes he did.

991
00:36:46.237 --> 00:36:48.239
- No. he didn't.

992
00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:49.207
Look. no he didn't. - Yes he did.

993
00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:50.841
- No. he didn't.

994
00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:52.243
He didn't.

995
00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:53.978
He didn't. I promise.

996
00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:58.583
Now you may now see it right now but

997
00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:00.151
you gonna get over this.

998
00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:02.553
Fangaz ain't mean that stuff he was saying.

999
00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:04.889
You just crushed his little manhood.

1000
00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:07.091
(Haven laughing) That's it.

1001
00:37:07.091 --> 00:37:09.427
About his future child and (chuckling)

1002
00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:10.695
that sh.

1003
00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:13.331
I mean. that stuff was low key funny.

1004
00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:16.834
(both laughing)

1005
00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:18.703
- Right? - Just a little bit.

1006
00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:19.537
- Yeah.

1007
00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:21.205
Just relax.

1008
00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:23.040
Don't worry about him.

1009
00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:28.512
What are um.

1010
00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:29.747
what are those?

1011
00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:33.484
- Uh. my writings on the wall?

1012
00:37:33.484 --> 00:37:34.785
- Yeah.

1013
00:37:34.785 --> 00:37:37.722
- Um. those are my prayer requests.

1014
00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:42.093
- That's like that lady from the movie

1015
00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:44.762
where she sat in closet the whole time.

1016
00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:47.164
She actually told him how to pray.

1017
00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:48.232
- War Room? - War Room.

1018
00:37:48.232 --> 00:37:49.333
(Haven laughing)

1019
00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:50.568
That's it.

1020
00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:52.570
And my grandma. she took me to it

1021
00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.538
as soon as it came out.

1022
00:37:54.538 --> 00:37:55.973
I didn't. I didn't want to go

1023
00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:57.275
but

1024
00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:59.176
she wasn't having that.

1025
00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:01.412
- Sounds like she don't play.

1026
00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:03.581
Not even the radio. (Haven laughing)

1027
00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:04.815
- You gone see.

1028
00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:07.818
- Mm.

1029
00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:12.223
I wish I had someone to spend time with me like that.

1030
00:38:12.223 --> 00:38:13.658
You're lucky.

1031
00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:17.261
- I mean. from the pictures on the hall look like

1032
00:38:17.261 --> 00:38:19.263
you had a pretty good life to me.

1033
00:38:19.263 --> 00:38:20.097
- Oh.

1034
00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:24.635
Material things don't move me.

1035
00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:31.142
My dad spends all his time to the church and everyone else.

1036
00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:35.980
He doesn't really have much time for me.

1037
00:38:38.182 --> 00:38:40.751
Those material things.

1038
00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:42.953
they don't move me.

1039
00:38:42.953 --> 00:38:46.290
He uses those to fill the void.

1040
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.124
I guess.

1041
00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:53.864
- Where you're old lady?

1042
00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:54.899
- Huh?

1043
00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:55.733
- Your mom.

1044
00:38:55.733 --> 00:38:56.567
Where your mom?

1045
00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:57.401
- Oh uh.

1046
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.004
yeah.

1047
00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:03.741
She died when I was three.

1048
00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:10.014
- I'm sorry to hear that.

1049
00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:10.881
- Yeah.

1050
00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:12.316
What about yours?

1051
00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:17.388
- She died house two.

1052
00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:18.222
Oh.

1053
00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:23.094
I'm sorry to hear that.

1054
00:39:24.562 --> 00:39:29.567
(sighs) I guess we have more in common than we thought.

1055
00:39:30.735 --> 00:39:31.936
- Yeah. let's get me at this war room

1056
00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.337
(both laughing) (cell phone ringing)

1057
00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:34.672
before I turn it to one of them ladies

1058
00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:36.240
(Haven laughing) from the movie.

1059
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.909
(cellphone ringing) - Oh shoot. um.

1060
00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:40.444
My dad's calling.

1061
00:39:40.444 --> 00:39:42.413
Okay so if I don't answer. he's gonna send

1062
00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:44.115
Mrs. Easley from the church to come check on me.

1063
00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:45.383
- Okay. I'll give a little privacy.

1064
00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:46.584
- No. no. no. stay. (cellphone ringing)

1065
00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:47.585
- All right.

1066
00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:50.321
- Hello?

1067
00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:52.623
And before you ask daddy. yes I'm okay.

1068
00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:53.858
- [Shaunie] Did you tell her yet?

1069
00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:56.193
- [Hosea] (sighs) Not yet. - Hello?

1070
00:39:56.193 --> 00:39:57.928
- [Shaunie] Well. you better hurry up.

1071
00:39:57.928 --> 00:39:59.397
- Daddy. - [Shaunie] We don't have long

1072
00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:01.399
and I refuse to walk down this aisle with a big stomach.

1073
00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:02.633
- [Hosea] Yeah. yeah. well. um.

1074
00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:03.868
- [Shaunie] I'm not bringing this baby

1075
00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:05.403
into this world. unmarried. Hosea.

1076
00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:07.505
(Asa clears throat) - [Hosea] Baby.

1077
00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:08.339
I got you.

1078
00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:12.643
(phone beeps)

1079
00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:14.245
- Haven.

1080
00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:15.079
You okay?

1081
00:40:18.048 --> 00:40:18.883
Haven.

1082
00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:21.485
You all right?

1083
00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.559
(door knocking)

1084
00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:32.430
- Yo.

1085
00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:35.599
Yo. Haven.

1086
00:40:36.734 --> 00:40:38.302
Haven.

1087
00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:39.603
Yo. real quick uh.

1088
00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:41.105
I just wanted to apologize about earlier.

1089
00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:42.406
That was my fault. for real. for real.

1090
00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.241
- (scoffs) It's fine.

1091
00:40:44.241 --> 00:40:45.209

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:26.770
- [Sleeze] But how.

1269
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.405
how they knew where she was. though?

1270
00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:29.940
- Chinirika.

1271
00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:33.110
Chinirika was Trouble's mama's best friend.

1272
00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:35.612
She told him everything. bruh.

1273
00:48:37.147 --> 00:48:39.149
- That's crazy as fuck. - I know. bruh.

1274
00:48:39.149 --> 00:48:41.818
- What the fuck? - [Fangaz] Yeah.

1275
00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:44.454
- Yo. you straight?

1276
00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:46.323
- Yeah.

1277
00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:48.959
I'm good. - All right.

1278
00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:52.262
- I'm just think about tonight.

1279
00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:54.031

- Man. chill.

00:48:59.903 --> 00:49:00.771
Don't start that shit.

1285
00:49:00.771 --> 00:49:02.306
I told Shea.

1286
00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:03.573
Damn. - All I'm saying is. bro

1287
00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:05.509
we can't afford no slip ups. - I got it.

1288
00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:07.144
- All right.

1289
00:49:07.144 --> 00:49:10.213
Shit. if you ready then let's be out.

1290
00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:16.019
♪ See. had a dollar and dream

1291
00:49:16.019 --> 00:49:17.955

1296
00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:31.668
- [Fangaz] It's a church. bruh.

1297
00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:35.439
- Hey. you know. you need to put

1298
00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:36.840
your good boy act on. right?

1299
00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.009
- Yeah. whatever.

1300
00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:40.844
Miss me with all that.

1301
00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:43.580
I'ma do what I'm supposed to do.

1302
00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.683
Just make sure you do what you're supposed to.

1303
00:49:46.683 --> 00:49:49.019
- (scoffs) All right.

1304
00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:50.253
You ready? - Yeah.

1305
00:49:50.253 --> 00:49:51.888
- I'm glad you took them goofy ass shades off.

1306
00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:54.992
In the house of the Lord. (both chuckling)

1307
00:49:54.992 --> 00:49:57.127
- And it's my favorite scripture in the bible

1308
00:49:57.127 --> 00:50:00.697
because he went through great test.

1309
00:50:00.697 --> 00:50:02.432
- [Women] That's right. - But he kept the faith.

1310
00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:03.967
- [Women] Amen.

1311
00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:05.769
- The race is not given to the swift nor the mighty.

1312
00:50:05.769 --> 00:50:06.970
- Mm.

1313
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.372
- But to those who endure to end.

1314
00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:09.606
- Glory to god. - Amen.

1315
00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:10.807
- [All] Amen. - Amen.

1316
00:50:10.807 --> 00:50:12.376
I will see you next week.

1317
00:50:12.376 --> 00:50:13.577
I love you.

1318
00:50:13.577 --> 00:50:15.679
Love on somebody on your way out. all right?

1319
00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:19.883
(indistinct group chatter)

1320
00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:20.984
- [Mila] Bye.

1321
00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:24.855
- [Haven] Oh. my God. it's time. okay. okay.

1322
00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:25.956
- Stop fidgeting. you look amazing.

1323
00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:27.424
- Okay. - You look amazing

1324
00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:29.226
and Trouble's gonna love it. - [Haven] You think so?

1325
00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:30.494
- [Mila] Yes.

1326
00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:32.562
- [Haven] All right. let's go. let's go.

1327
00:50:32.562 --> 00:50:34.464
(Haven clears throat)

1328
00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:35.399
- [Asa] What's up. gorgeous.

1329
00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:36.733
- [Fangaz] Hey. beautiful.

1330
00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:38.835
- Hey handsome.

1331
00:50:38.835 --> 00:50:40.470
- I love this look on you.

1332
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:43.840
- Thank you. yeah. you know. um

1333
00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.143
Mila's starting to do her little hair braiding thing

1334
00:50:46.143 --> 00:50:48.211
and now I'm her walking guinea pig.

1335
00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:49.279
(both laughing)

1336
00:50:49.279 --> 00:50:51.448
But. uh. I kind of like it.

1337
00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:52.682
- Yeah. it's fire.

1338
00:50:52.682 --> 00:50:54.718
It's fire but that's not what I mean.

1339
00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:55.952
- What do you mean?

1340
00:50:55.952 --> 00:50:58.889
- I love this look of confidence on you.

1341
00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:01.491
- How come you don't ever say nothing like that to me?

1342
00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:02.559
- (sucks teeth) First of all. baby.

1343
00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:03.760
that's corny.

1344
00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.729
All right. baby. I'm a big gangster.

1345
00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:06.897
Big gangster.

1346
00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:07.898
- You get on my nerves

1347
00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:08.832
so bad. - The biggest gangster.

1348
00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:09.699
I'm the biggest gangster.

1349
00:51:09.699 --> 00:51:10.700
Yeah. he'll tell you.

1350
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.669
He can vouch for that. yeah.

1351
00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:13.904
For real.

1352
00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:15.238
- [Mila] You get on my nerves so bad.

1353
00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:17.741
(Haven giggling) - This guy.

1354
00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:19.342
- Are you ready? - Yeah.

1355
00:51:19.342 --> 00:51:20.310
- Are you sure?

1356
00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:21.711
- (sucks teeth) Yes.

1357
00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:22.646
Okay. just.

1358
00:51:24.247 --> 00:51:26.850
Okay. (Haven giggling)

1359
00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:27.684
Daddy.

1360
00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:30.787
- Hey baby.

1361
00:51:30.787 --> 00:51:32.222
- Hey. thank you.

1362
00:51:33.857 --> 00:51:34.925
- (chuckling) Who's this?

1363
00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:36.827
- Okay. um. daddy.

1364
00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:38.328
This is Asa. - Mm.

1365
00:51:38.328 --> 00:51:40.864
- Asa. this is my dad.

1366
00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:42.165
Pastor Reynolds.

1367
00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:43.266
- Nice to meet you young. man.

1368
00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:44.734
- Nice to meet you. sir. - Mm-hmm.

1369
00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:46.903
- So. uh. you go to school with the girls.

1370
00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:48.205
- I do.

1371
00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:49.873
Um. we actually take a few classes together.

1372
00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:51.708
(Shaunie clears throat)

1373
00:51:51.708 --> 00:51:53.410
- Excuse me. sorry.

1374
00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:54.911
My throat is dry.

1375
00:51:54.911 --> 00:51:58.548
I'm gonna go get some water. I'll be right back.

1376
00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:01.985
- So. uh.

1377
00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:04.754
how's your grades. Asa?

1378
00:52:04.754 --> 00:52:06.490
- Daddy. you don't have to do that right now.

1379
00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:07.958
- It's cool. beautiful.

1380
00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.459
It's cool. I don't mind answering his questions.

1381
00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:11.027
I mean. if it was my only daughter

1382
00:52:11.027 --> 00:52:13.497
bringing me some guy I never met before.

1383
00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:15.699
I'd probably be the same way.

1384
00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:17.634
But to answer your question. sir.

1385
00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:20.737
I've been an honor student since the ninth grade.

1386
00:52:20.737 --> 00:52:24.307
before then I was a little rebellious acting out.

1387
00:52:24.307 --> 00:52:26.176
'Cause I missed my mom. - Mm hmm.

1388
00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:29.746
- But my granna sat me down and explained to me

1389
00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:31.548
how important school was.

1390
00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:32.415
- Hmm.

1391
00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:33.817
- Ever since then

1392
00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:35.485
got it together.

1393
00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:37.687
- (chuckling) That's nice.

1394
00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:39.189
Nice. I like that.

1395
00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:41.424
We're gonna have to have you over to the house for dinner.

1396
00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:42.592
Me and you can talk. - [Asa] Yeah.

1397
00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:43.793
- Get to know each other a little bit more.

1398
00:52:43.793 --> 00:52:46.029
- Yeah. - Yeah. I like that.

1399
00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:48.899
- Well. I ain't gonna keep you. baby girl.

1400
00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:50.700
I know you got to go do your thing.

1401
00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.968
- Yeah. - All right.

1402
00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:53.036
You don't try to stay out too late.

1403
00:52:53.036 --> 00:52:55.138
- I won't. we'll be home on time.

1404
00:52:55.138 --> 00:52:55.972
- Mm-hmm.

1405
00:52:55.972 --> 00:52:56.907
- Nice to meet you.

1406
00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:57.741
- Same.

1407
00:52:57.741 --> 00:52:58.842
- Asa.

1408
00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:00.510
- Pastor Reynolds. - Hmm.

1409
00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:02.546
- See you later. daddy.

1410
00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:03.480
- All right. baby.

1411
00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.115
- All right. all right. preach.

1412
00:53:05.115 --> 00:53:08.351
- Yeah. (Haven laughing)

1413
00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:09.619
- [Haven] That kind of went okay.

1414
00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:10.820
- [Asa] It was good. - [Haven] Slightly.

1415
00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.256
You know. - [Asa] It was good.

1416
00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:16.860
(indistinct group chatter)

1417
00:53:30.473 --> 00:53:31.508
- Oh.

1418
00:53:31.508 --> 00:53:33.210
- Yo. why you leave like that?

1419
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:36.546
- Oh baby. I told you I was thirsty.

1420
00:53:36.546 --> 00:53:37.981
I had to go get a drink of water.

1421
00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:39.950
My mouth was dry.

1422
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:41.218
You would've heard me

1423
00:53:41.218 --> 00:53:43.720
if you were listening to me and instead of Haven.

1424
00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.222
- Don't start with that.

1425
00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:47.824
You know when my daughter is concerned. it's about her.

1426
00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:49.226
- (scoffs) Yeah. - All right.

1427
00:53:49.226 --> 00:53:50.460
- Yeah. you right.

1428
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:53.330
- But what about when this baby gets here? Hm?

1429
00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:55.365
Is this baby gonna get that same treatment?

1430
00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:57.734
Hm? And does. does Haven even know?

1431
00:53:57.734 --> 00:53:59.936
- When this baby gets here.

1432
00:54:01.137 --> 00:54:03.974
I'm going to treat her the same way.

1433
00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:05.809
- Mm-hmm. you better.

1434
00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:07.477
'Cause one thing I won't have

1435
00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:10.180
is my baby feeling inferior to Haven.

1436
00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.481
You don't have to worry about that.

1437
00:54:11.481 --> 00:54:12.716
- Uh-huh. okay.

1438
00:54:13.883 --> 00:54:16.286
It's not the right time.

1439
00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:17.921
No. no. when you're gonna tell her?

1440
00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:20.523
You gonna wait 'til I'm pushing or something?

1441
00:54:20.523 --> 00:54:22.892
- I got it. baby. okay?

1442

1975
01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:37.539
love you.

1976
01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:41.143
Unlike that no good bastard

1977
01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:43.979
that killed

1978
01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:44.813
my daughter.

1979
01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:46.414
Not that man.

1980
01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:48.583
That man is Satan himself.

1981
01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:53.188
You see. my gift of discernment is sharper.

1982
01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:55.257
I can read anybody.

1983
01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:58.360
From the moment I laid my eyes on that negro.

1984
01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.495
I knew he wasn't no good.

1985
01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:04.065
I begged and I begged and I begged her to cut him loose.

1986
01:20:04.065 --> 01:20:06.902
but he had a hold on her so tight.

1987
01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:10.071
It almost suffocated me.

1988
01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:12.974
And then

1989
01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:13.875
she told me

1990
01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:16.178
for my family.

1991
01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:17.012
but baby.

1992
01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:22.417
the night you showed up on my porch.

1993
01:20:22.417 --> 01:20:25.153
I promise you. girl was like.

1994
01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:29.424
like granna had seen my angel straight from heaven.

1995
01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:36.198
- Thank you. granna.

1996
01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:38.834
- Your mother

1997
01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:44.005
is proud of the woman that you are becoming baby.

1998
01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:51.613
- I can't believe your father wanted to kill me.

1999
01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:54.015
Why? I had nothing to do with anything.

2000
01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:56.318
- That nigga ain't my daddy.

2001
01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.387
Just some nigga that nutted in my mama.

2002
01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:00.188
That's it.

2003
01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:04.693
Haven. the day that Chop showed me that picture of you

2004
01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.962
I literally was tripping.

2005
01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.196
I just met you.

2006
01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:12.534
And he talking 'bout. get close to you.

2007
01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.202
Get you to trust me.

2008
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:18.340
I was supposed to bring you into him.

2009
01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:23.845
- Were you gonna kill me?

2010
01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:28.116
- Honestly.

2011
01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:30.952
I was just. I was just gonna listen to his orders.

2012
01:21:30.952 --> 01:21:33.288
but Haven something changed.

2013
01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:36.625
Everything changed. Haven.

2014
01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:39.060
Look.

2015
01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:43.164
it's not just because we had sex.

2016
01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:47.002
It's that conversation we had in your closet.

2017
01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:50.071
I knew you were a real deal

2018
01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:52.007
and I understand why you were sent to me.

2019
01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:53.141
I get it. now.

2020
01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:56.077
Look. it may have started out.

2021
01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:58.647
by some plan the enemy started.

2022
01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:03.184
but God turned it around for us.

2023
01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:04.686
- Hey. hallelujah!

2024
01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:08.056
Okay. Yes. grand baby. - Grandma.

2025
01:22:08.056 --> 01:22:09.257
- Oh. baby.

2026
01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:10.759
I'm sorry.

2027
01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:14.195
You know how I get what God shows himself approved.

2028
01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:15.030
I'ma hush.

2029
01:22:18.967 --> 01:22:22.337
- Is that what you' trying to tell me that night.

2030
01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:23.171
- Yeah.

2031
01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:27.042
- I meant everything I said Haven.

2032
01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:27.943
I meant it.

2033
01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:34.249
I just hope that you can forgive me.

2034
01:22:35.517 --> 01:22:37.519
- Okay. what about Chop? - [Asa] Look.

2035
01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:39.087
- What if he tries to kill me?

2036
01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:41.122
- You ain't gonna have to worry about him no more.

2037
01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:41.957
Okay?

2038
01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:46.227
My three girls are protected.

2039
01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:47.062
All right?

2040
01:22:48.029 --> 01:22:49.264
- What?

2041
01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:50.799
What are you talking about three girls.

2042
01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:51.666
- Granna.

2043
01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.001
You.

2044
01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:54.803
And my little princess baking in there.

2045
01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.338
(Haven chuckles)

2046
01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:57.439
- And here you go.

2047
01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:59.240
How do you know it's a girl?

2048
01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:02.077
- I don't. but granna said it. so

2049
01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:04.045
it must be law. - [Haven] Not granna.

2050
01:23:04.045 --> 01:23:05.046
(all laughing)

2051
01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:06.881
- We just gonna run with it.

2052
01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:09.651
We just gonna go with it but look.

2053
01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:11.886
we gonna start a new life.

2054
01:23:11.886 --> 01:23:12.721
Us three.

2055
01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:16.257
Our love.

2056
01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:18.026
honesty.

2057
01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:20.395
respect.

2058
01:23:21.596 --> 01:23:24.933
all that other stuff you were telling me.

2059
01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:26.835
It's over now.

2060
01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:27.669
Okay?

2061
01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.475
All right?

2062
01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:35.910
Don't worry.

2063
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:36.745
I got you.

2064
01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:38.947
Okay?

2065
01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:42.817
(police sirens)

2066
01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:47.055
- [Guard] Reynolds.

2067
01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:07.909
- [Kidnapped girl] Get off me!

2068
01:24:07.909 --> 01:24:09.377
What is going on?

2069
01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:11.046
Please get off of me!

2070
01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:12.313
No!

2071
01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:12.981
- [Kidnapper] Ah. shut the fuck up.

2072
01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:15.417
(gunshots)

2073
01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:17.419
(bible thuds)

2074
01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:20.922
(Hosea exclaims)

2075
01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:22.190
- Love you.

2076
01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:23.658
- I love you too.

2077
01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:24.926
(intense music)

2078
01:24:24.926 --> 01:24:28.930
(inmates speaking indistinctly)

2079
01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:49.184
(dramatic music)

2080
01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.494
- You good?

2081
01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:07.402
(sighs) I'm so disgusted by these charges.

2082
01:25:07.402 --> 01:25:10.238
I won't even beat around the bush.

2083
01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:12.941
You're going down.

2084
01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:15.443
And if I have anything to do with it.

2085
01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.946
it's gonna be for a long time.

2086
01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.215
- Whatever. man

2087
01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:23.384
- I've seen people get arrested for

2088
01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:26.054
almost everything under the sun.

2089
01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:30.258
So the drugs and the murders don't really surprise me.

2090
01:25:30.258 --> 01:25:33.261
But what doesn't surprise me is that you

2091
01:25:33.261 --> 01:25:36.898
have the audacity to play with God

2092
01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:39.834
by claiming to be a servant of his.

2093
01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:47.342
You give good pastors

2094
01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:51.813
who are really about this life.

2095
01:25:52.714 --> 01:25:53.615
a bad name.

2096
01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:57.418
- I don't know what you're talking about.

2097
01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:58.786
Those things that you found.

2098
01:25:58.786 --> 01:26:00.522
don't belong to me.

2099
01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:02.457
And I don't know how it got there.

2100
01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:03.758
All right?

2101
01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:05.026
As a man of God.

2102
01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:08.696
as a man of the cloth I would never. never.

2103
01:26:08.696 --> 01:26:11.666
never do anything to disrespect God.

2104
01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:12.500
- Wow!

2105
01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:14.769
Unbelievable.

2106
01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:18.606
I stand in front of my congregation

2107
01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:21.943
every Sunday and Wednesday doing my best

2108
01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:27.649
to lead God's people back to him

2109
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:30.585
and pray that I don't do anything to make them fall

2110
01:26:30.585 --> 01:26:33.021
while under my leadership.

2111
01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:37.759
I'm responsible for those souls that I'm teaching.

2112
01:26:37.759 --> 01:26:39.527
Do you not understand

2113
01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:42.363
that their blood is on my hands

2114
01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:44.866
if I were to lead them astray?

2115
01:26:51.005 --> 01:26:53.508
(deep breath)

2116
01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:56.778
- Those people are grown

2117
01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:01.950
and they're gonna do what they wanna do.

2118
01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:03.685
no matter what I say.

2119
01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:07.689
And if they were really so

2120
01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:08.523
holy.

2121
01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:12.627
they would realize that I picked out the scriptures

2122
01:27:12.627 --> 01:27:16.898
that hyped them up to make them fork off for money.

2123
01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:23.037
- They may be grown.

2124
01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:29.143
But what about your daughter?

2125
01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:45.827
- Baby?

2126
01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:49.330
What are we doing here?

2127
01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:55.036
- Get out.

2128
01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:57.872

2156
01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:58.633
I was just trying to find the right time to tell you.

2157
01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:02.570
I thought. I thought that maybe if I told you the right way.

2158
01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:04.872
he would accept it.

2159
01:29:04.872 --> 01:29:06.007
(Chop scoffs)

2160
01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:07.842
- Believe this broad? (both chuckle)

2161
01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:10.611
- I. I'm telling the truth. baby.

2162
01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:13.147
Listen.

2163
01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:16.084
I just.

2164
01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:19.520
I know you weren't there for Trouble when he was born and

2165
01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.922
maybe this is our chance.

2166
01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:22.657
Maybe now we can be a family.

2167
01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:25.827
Maybe God is giving you another chance.

2168
01:29:25.827 --> 01:29:29.497
- (laughing) You said. God?

2169
01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:33.034
You talking about the same God that

2170
01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:34.569
you and that bitch ass nigga Keys is using

2171
01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:37.205
to pimp the saints whenever the door to the church is open?

2172
01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:38.139
(thunder roaring)

2173
01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:39.741
You talking about that God?

2174
01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:41.409
You talking about that God?

2175
01:29:41.409 --> 01:29:42.610
You funny as shit.

2176
01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:44.612
She funny as shit. ain't she? (laughing)

2177
01:29:44.612 --> 01:29:47.582
You is a funny mother fucker.

2178
01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:50.451
(Chinirika laughing)

2179
01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:51.719
- You know the only thing funny

2180
01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:54.422
is trying to reason with a man like you.

2181
01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:57.658
Shit. I should have been left your ass.

2182
01:29:57.658 --> 01:30:00.094
(tense music)

2183
01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:03.398
None of this shit is worth it.

2184
01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:04.832
And Keys.

2185
01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:06.401
would've been a way better daddy to this baby

2186
01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:08.736
than you could ever be.

2187
01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:11.339
Shit. he was a way better boss.

2188
01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:14.275
That nigga stole your dope.

2189
01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:18.913
Started from nothing and still leveled up on your ass.

2190
01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:19.747
(scoffs)

2191
01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:21.249
I see why you mad.

2192
01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:25.820
(gun clicks)

2193
01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.488
(repeated gunshots) (Shea shouting)

2194
01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:28.489
- Put that on God!

2195
01:30:28.489 --> 01:30:29.690
Put that on God!

2196
01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:30.525
- Damn.

2197
01:30:31.859 --> 01:30:33.861
I ain't see that coming.

2198
01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:36.197
(cocks gun)

2199
01:30:36.197 --> 01:30:38.666
Just like you didn't see this.

2200
01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:39.500
Yeah.

2201
01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.301
Yeah.

2202
01:30:41.536 --> 01:30:44.238
See you and Keys are alike in many ways.

2203
01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:45.773
Y'all both about money.

2204
01:30:45.773 --> 01:30:49.177
Get rid of any nigga that get in y'all way.

2205
01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:52.580
But the difference between y'all two is;

2206
01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:56.217
unlike him. you let your feelings guide you.

2207
01:30:57.652 --> 01:31:00.288
And you don't always know who on your team.

2208
01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:01.522
Big ass mistake.

2209
01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:06.494
- Nigga. I always know who I got in my squad.

2210
01:31:06.494 --> 01:31:07.328
- Really?

2211
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:09.130
So tell me.

2212
01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:13.167
you knew Kenya's brother was on your team?

2213
01:31:13.167 --> 01:31:15.203
(thunder roars)

2214
01:31:15.203 --> 01:31:16.137
- What the fuck you talking about?

2215
01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:18.339
(gunshot) (Chop screams)

2216
01:31:18.339 --> 01:31:19.607
Ah shit!

2217
01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:20.708
- Bitch ass nigga.

2218
01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:22.910
- You bitch ass nigga! (gun clicks)

2219
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:24.312
- Probably shouldn't have used all your bullets

2220
01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:27.114
on your little boo right here.

2221
01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:30.785
(chuckles) Imagine.

2222
01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:31.786
Just imagine

2223
01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:38.359
your mother gettin' the car the night before Christmas.

2224
01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:44.432
and the police telling her her only daughter being shot.

2225
01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:46.567
Nigga. you know how it feel

2226
01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:48.336
to hear the woman that birthed you

2227
01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:51.973
struggle to breathe after hearing that shit?

2228
01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:58.212
But oh. what a God we serve. right?

2229
01:31:58.212 --> 01:31:59.847
What a God we serve.

2230
01:32:01.315 --> 01:32:04.118
'Cause right when we rushed in.

2231
01:32:04.118 --> 01:32:07.255
the doctors told us they was able to bring Kenya back.

2232
01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:09.590
(cocks gun)

2233
01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:13.361
- Kenya alive?

2234
01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:14.428
(gunshot) (Chop yelling)

2235
01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:16.564
- Did I fuckin' say talk?

2236
01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:18.799
- You bitch. - Did I say talk?

2237
01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:20.968
- Bitch ass nigga.

2238
01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:22.770
- I made my sister a promise

2239
01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:26.240
sitting next to her hospital bed.

2240
01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:29.143
I told her my niece will be taken care of.

2241
01:32:29.143 --> 01:32:30.344
(chuckles)

2242
01:32:30.344 --> 01:32:32.680
Before I take my last breath

2243
01:32:35.316 --> 01:32:37.518
you and keys will already taken yours.

2244
01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:39.654
(Chop wincing)

2245
01:32:39.654 --> 01:32:41.455
- Nigga. you must have forgot

2246
01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:42.890
you talking about.

2247
01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:43.724
ah shit.

2248
01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:45.660
Nigga.

2249
01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:48.529
you was saying all that shit about

2250
01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:50.498
who all on everybody team you early.

2251
01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:53.267
You must've forgot who had on my fuckin' team. nigga.

2252
01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:55.102
(Chop winces)

2253
01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:57.705
If I don't show up as planned later on

2254
01:32:57.705 --> 01:33:00.207
Trouble and all them niggas gonna be on your head.

2255
01:33:00.207 --> 01:33:02.977
'Cause they knew I was coming to meet your bitch ass.

2256
01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:05.112
(wincing) Oh shit.

2257
01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:06.080
- [Man On phone] Is it done yet?

2258
01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.582
- Almost.

2259
01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:09.050
Your boy here seems to think

2260
01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:10.351
that y'all gonna be on my head

2261
01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:12.920
when he don't meet up with y'all later.

2262
01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:13.921
You know. considering the fact

2263
01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:15.189
everybody knew he was me.

2264
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:16.424
- [Man] I thought you was calling to tell me

2265
01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:18.426
his body was stinking by now. - What the?

2266
01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:21.028
- [Man] After all the shit that he done caused us.

2267
01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:22.063
- [Chop] Fuck.

2268
01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:23.698
- Indeed. - Man. fuck that nigga.

2269
01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:25.199
- Indeed.

2270
01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:28.235
I'll pull up when it's done.

2271
01:33:28.235 --> 01:33:32.573
- [Chop] (whispering) Fuck.

2272
01:33:32.573 --> 01:33:37.244
- My mama's favorite scripture for as long as I can remember

2273
01:33:37.244 --> 01:33:39.580
was Galatians six and seven.

2274
01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:42.450
Do not be deceived.

2275
01:33:43.584 --> 01:33:45.519
God will not be mocked.

2276
01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:49.290
A man reaps what he sows.

2277
01:33:51.225 --> 01:33:52.226
Good or bad.

2278
01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:55.396
You reap the benefits of what you plant.

2279
01:33:55.396 --> 01:33:57.598
- Nigga. shut that shit up!

2280
01:33:57.598 --> 01:34:00.001
Don't nobody wanna hear no god damn sermon.

2281
01:34:00.001 --> 01:34:03.237
Nigga wanna commit a sin and it all holier than thou.

2282
01:34:03.237 --> 01:34:05.606
Nigga. you might as well go ahead kill me now. nigga. so.

2283
01:34:05.606 --> 01:34:09.210
- As you please. (gunshot)

2284
01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:17.151
- [Guard] Reynolds. you got a visitor.

2285
01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:21.155
(inmates shouting indistinctly)

2286
01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:44.845
Open cell five.

2287
01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:47.348
(cell buzzes)

2288
01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:04.699
- Baby girl.

2289
01:35:11.672 --> 01:35:12.506
You alive.

2290
01:35:13.674 --> 01:35:16.277
God knows I was worried about you.

2291
01:35:17.578 --> 01:35:20.381
- You was worried about me?

2292
01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:23.150
Were you worried about me when you lied to me my whole life?

2293
01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:25.786
(intense music)

2294
01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:27.621
- Haven. listen to me.

2295
01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:31.959
I don't know what you heard about me.

2296
01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:35.162
but I did

2297
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:39.800
what was best for you at the time?

2298
01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.937
- (scoffs) No.

2299
01:35:42.937 --> 01:35:45.172
What was best for me?

2300
01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:46.874
What was best for me would've been

2301
01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:49.310
for you to tell me the truth.

2302
01:35:50.177 --> 01:35:51.712
What was best for me was be.

2303
01:35:51.712 --> 01:35:54.115
be for you to open your eyes!

2304
01:35:57.485 --> 01:36:01.322
For you to have not have lied and preached things

2305
01:36:01.322 --> 01:36:03.057
that you didn't even believe your damn self.

2306
01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:05.126
That's what would've been what's best for me.

2307
01:36:05.126 --> 01:36:06.260
But instead

2308
01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:07.094
you knew

2309
01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:11.298
how hurt I was

2310
01:36:13.167 --> 01:36:14.802
that I didn't have a mother

2311
01:36:14.802 --> 01:36:15.636
and instead.

2312
01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:16.871
instead of you.

2313
01:36:17.705 --> 01:36:18.873
instead of you

2314
01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:24.612
spending as much time with me as you could.

2315
01:36:27.882 --> 01:36:30.317
What was best for me would you for you to live

2316
01:36:30.317 --> 01:36:32.086
a life of honesty.

2317
01:36:32.086 --> 01:36:35.322
but you lied to an entire congregation.

2318
01:36:38.759 --> 01:36:41.262
I already lost my mother to cancer.

2319
01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:45.833
but here you are sacrificing your life and mine

2320
01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:46.667
every day

2321
01:36:48.769 --> 01:36:51.038
and you have to audacity to try to tell me

2322
01:36:51.038 --> 01:36:52.640
what's best for me.

2323
01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:56.844
(deep exhale)

2324
01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:02.750
You're right. baby girl.

2325
01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:06.320
I was selfish

2326
01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:14.695
and consumed with being the biggest kingpin to ever do it.

2327
01:37:18.432 --> 01:37:19.600
But your mama.

2328
01:37:23.237 --> 01:37:26.140
she really was the love of my life.

2329
01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:33.013
And I put her in harm's way too.

2330
01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:33.848
- What?

2331
01:37:37.484 --> 01:37:40.287
What do you mean. you put her in harms way?

2332
01:37:40.287 --> 01:37:41.522
(slams table) Dad.

2333
01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:44.625

Stop lying to me.

it takes her hours to settle back down.

2391
01:39:51.452 --> 01:39:52.686

I am so sorry that I couldn't walk with you

01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:32.192
like we always planned. Mi. - Oh. I know.

2416
01:40:32.192 --> 01:40:33.794
That's why I didn't walk.

2417
01:40:33.794 --> 01:40:35.095
- What?

2418
01:40:35.095 --> 01:40:36.630
- Calm down.

2419
01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:38.298
You know. I wasn't about to walk that stage

2420
01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:39.433
without my sister.

2421
01:40:39.433 --> 01:40:40.667
- Oh.

2422
01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:42.236
- So this just means when we get our masters.

2423
01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:44.671

Ah. ah! - Aye. ah. ah!

2426
01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:48.709

01:41:06.493 --> 01:41:09.096
- What. why didn't you tell me?

2437
01:41:10.798 --> 01:41:14.168
- I ain't wanna disappoint you just in case I failed.

2438
01:41:14.168 --> 01:41:16.503
- Maybe you can never disappoint me.

2439
01:41:16.503 --> 01:41:18.806
The fact that you stepped out on faith and took the test.

2440
01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:20.541
I am so proud of you.

2441
01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:23.544
(Asa sighs)

2442
01:41:23.544 --> 01:41:24.378

2444
01:41:25.813 --> 01:41:30.484

2445
01:41:50.637 --> 01:41:51.438
Okay.

2446
01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:55.542
- If you don't spit out that tea.

2447
01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:56.343
- Um.

2448
01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:00.948
Uh.

that my baby passed all four sections

2452
01:42:12.593 --> 01:42:13.861

01:42:13.861 --> 01:42:14.828
Praise god! - I passed?

2459
01:42:24.404 --> 01:42:27.074
- Thank you for not making me feel dumb.

01:42:27.074 --> 01:42:28.509

- I will always believe in you

2464
01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:34.781

2465
01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:37.217

- Oh?

2470
01:42:45.058 --> 01:42:46.326
- 'Cause instead of going to just.

2472
01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:50.063

- You know what I mean?

2483
01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:11.585
- No. I don't know what you mean

2484
01:43:11.585 --> 01:43:15.055

2490
01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:24.765
- If you weren't pregnant I would push you off this bed.

2491
01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:25.766
They are not that bad.

2492
01:43:25.766 --> 01:43:26.867
- They are horrible.

2493
01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:28.268
Like horrid.

2494
01:43:28.268 --> 01:43:29.336

(laughing)

2541
01:44:58.725 --> 01:44:59.559
Oh.

- This old lady ain't dead yet.

2544
01:45:02.462 --> 01:45:05.766
Besides Mr. Rufus as fine as he wanna be.

2545
01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:07.234
Look like a young Billy Dee.

- Okay. okay.

2561
01:45:35.562 --> 01:45:37.831
(monitor beeping)

2562
01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:40.500
- Just like that. - [Haven] Daddy.

2563
01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:43.236
(Mila chuckling)

2564
01:45:45.372 --> 01:45:48.508
- What's wrong with you. baby girl?

2565
01:45:48.508 --> 01:45:52.079
- (sighs) Nothing. it's.

2566
01:45:52.079 --> 01:45:52.913
I'm so.

2567
01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:56.283
I'm so appreciative

2568
01:45:56.283 --> 01:45:58.051
of you guys all thank you with me.

2569
01:45:58.051 --> 01:45:58.885
it's just.

2570
01:46:01.722 --> 01:46:03.623
I'm just realizing that

2571
01:46:05.058 --> 01:46:08.628
neither of my parents are here to experience this with me.

2572
01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:10.997
- Look. I understand baby.

2573
01:46:10.997 --> 01:46:12.966
but I. I'm just grateful

2574
01:46:12.966 --> 01:46:14.668
you got an opportunity

2575
01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:17.504
to talk to your daddy and forgive him.

2576
01:46:17.504 --> 01:46:19.873
Forgiveness is everything. baby.

2577
01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:21.641
- [Haven] Yes.

2578
01:46:21.641 --> 01:46:23.143
Yeah.

2579
01:46:23.143 --> 01:46:24.277
- Now.

2580
01:46:24.277 --> 01:46:25.612
have you all decided

2581
01:46:25.612 --> 01:46:27.280
what you gonna name this child?

2582
01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:28.548
I mean.

2583
01:46:28.548 --> 01:46:30.183
we can continue to call her gorgeous

2584
01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:33.086
because that's exactly what she is.

2585
01:46:33.086 --> 01:46:36.656
- (laughing) Yeah. we did.

2586
01:46:38.992 --> 01:46:41.428
That's unfortunate that Haven's parents aren't here

2587
01:46:41.428 --> 01:46:44.564
to experience this with us but

2588
01:46:44.564 --> 01:46:47.367
we still wanted to honor them so

2589
01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:49.503
we decided to name her

2590
01:46:49.503 --> 01:46:51.238
Kenya Hosanna Thomas.

2591
01:46:52.172 --> 01:46:53.774
- Amen.

2592
01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:55.942
- Did someone say my name?

2593
01:46:57.677 --> 01:46:59.880
(granna gasps)

2594
01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.014
- Mom?

2595
01:47:01.014 --> 01:47:02.749
- Oh. that's the God I serve.

2596
01:47:02.749 --> 01:47:04.284
- Mom? - Yes. baby. yes.

2597
01:47:04.284 --> 01:47:06.787
(both crying)

2598
01:47:08.755 --> 01:47:12.559
(indistinctly speaking through tears)

2599
01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:13.727
- Oh. my good.

2600
01:47:14.961 --> 01:47:16.630
Oh. let me see my baby.

2601
01:47:16.630 --> 01:47:19.633
- Oh. you gotta meet her. - Oh. my god.

2602
01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:21.134
- Oh. look at.

2603
01:47:21.134 --> 01:47:24.104
(Asa chuckling)

2604
01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:25.772
- Oh. you're a grandma.

2605
01:47:25.772 --> 01:47:28.008
- You sweet beautiful baby.

2606
01:47:29.743 --> 01:47:31.711
(whispering indistinctly)

2607
01:47:31.711 --> 01:47:33.914
- [Kenya] Granny's here now.

2608
01:47:33.914 --> 01:47:36.149
(laughing)

2609
01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:41.888
- We did it. - We did it.

2610
01:47:41.888 --> 01:47:43.056
- Oh. look at.

2611
01:47:44.558 --> 01:47:46.393
- I'm so proud of you.

2612
01:47:53.099 --> 01:47:54.601
- Hey. - Asa!

2613
01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:55.936
If you had to taken any longer to open that door.

2614
01:47:55.936 --> 01:47:57.804
you was gonna have to change my diaper.

2615
01:47:57.804 --> 01:47:58.638
(Kenya laughing) - I'm sorry.

2616
01:47:58.638 --> 01:47:59.739
I'm sorry.

2617
01:47:59.739 --> 01:48:00.974
- How you doing baby? - I'm good.

2618
01:48:00.974 --> 01:48:01.842
- You ain't keeping up no trouble. are you?

2619
01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:02.642
- No. - Okay. good.

2620
01:48:02.642 --> 01:48:03.877
Now. get out my way.

2621
01:48:03.877 --> 01:48:04.878
I'm here to see my granddaughter.

2622
01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:07.247
- Yeah. - Where is Gigi's baby?

2623
01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:08.515
- She's right here.

2624
01:48:08.515 --> 01:48:11.284
- [Kenya] Gigi's baby. come here to grandma.

2625
01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:13.687
- Here she is. - Bring her to me.

2626
01:48:13.687 --> 01:48:15.255
Let me see here.

2627
01:48:15.255 --> 01:48:16.323
- Hi there.

2628
01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:18.758
little Kenya benya. - Hey.

2629
01:48:18.758 --> 01:48:22.028
- Hi. stinker. (Haven sighs)

2630
01:48:22.028 --> 01:48:22.863
- Hey. Meech.

2631
01:48:22.863 --> 01:48:23.997
Let me holler at you

2632
01:48:23.997 --> 01:48:24.998
for a minute. - [Kenya] How are you

2633
01:48:24.998 --> 01:48:26.199
doing baby? - All right.

2634
01:48:26.199 --> 01:48:27.434
- [Kenya] Oh my goodness.

2635
01:48:27.434 --> 01:48:29.936
Did you know that your name was...

2636
01:48:37.210 --> 01:48:38.745
(Asa sighs)

2637
01:48:38.745 --> 01:48:39.913
- Man. they say

2638
01:48:39.913 --> 01:48:41.748
whoever killed O'Shea.

2639
01:48:43.083 --> 01:48:45.752
put two bullets in his body.

2640
01:48:45.752 --> 01:48:47.020
- It was three.

2641
01:48:48.889 --> 01:48:49.890
- Man. look.

2642
01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:54.928
I know you was O'Shea's right hand man for years.

2643
01:48:54.928 --> 01:48:57.964
but I need you to understand.

2644
01:48:57.964 --> 01:49:00.901
I need to make sure I can trust you.

2645
01:49:03.036 --> 01:49:04.771
- Look. man.

2646
01:49:04.771 --> 01:49:07.440
My business was with O'Shea.

2647
01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:11.211
Long as you take care of Haven and that baby.

2648
01:49:11.211 --> 01:49:12.045
we good.

2649
01:49:13.246 --> 01:49:15.682
- (chuckling) All right.

2650
01:49:15.682 --> 01:49:18.952
(hip hop music begins)

2651
01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:24.824
- Damn. fool.

2652
01:49:26.826 --> 01:49:28.428
How is he?

2653
01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:30.764
- Well. he's finally resting.

2654
01:49:30.764 --> 01:49:31.831
I'm surprised he's still alive

2655
01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:33.767
after all the blood he's lost.

2656
01:49:33.767 --> 01:49:36.202
You sure you don't wanna take him to the hospital?

2657
01:49:36.202 --> 01:49:38.471
- Look. no hospitals. no visitors.

2658
01:49:38.471 --> 01:49:40.473
Nobody can know he's here.

2659
01:49:40.473 --> 01:49:41.741
Just do what the fuck I pay you for

2660
01:49:41.741 --> 01:49:44.044
