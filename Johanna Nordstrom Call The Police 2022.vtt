4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.080
CALL THE POLICE

5
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.960
Hello! Wow!

6
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.840
Thanks! You're so nice!

7
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.840
Damn. there is so many of you.

8
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.680
Damn!

9
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.240
We haven't really been waiting for this…

10
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.680
We had to rebook a couple of times.

11
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.240
We chose the smaller venue for today.
so to speak.

12
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.040
Damn. it's nice to be here.
I have been touring this fall.

13
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.320
I have been to places like Falun.

14
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.600
Kristianstad.

15
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.120
Borås.

16
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.680
Me and Borås aren't the best of friends.
you could say.

17
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.320
So. it's nice to be back in
Stockholm again. At Aviici Arena!

18
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.280
Wow.

19
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.760
So. we had to move this show
quite a few times.

20
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.120
Because of the ongoing pandemic.

21
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.040
Wasn't that great?

22
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.680
I'm not going to talk about the pandemic.
but most things were shut down.

23
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.280
The clubs were shut.
There was no place to do stand-up.

24
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.360
Restaurants and shops were shut.
So. most things were shut.

25
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.160
apart from Spy Bar…

26
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.720
They were open during a short period.

27
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.120
And I ran at it.
so to speak. at full throttle.

28
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.680
Drunk as a skunk. I stood there
with a champagne bucket on my head…

29
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.960
…and someone was filming.

30
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.920
This was spread in media.

31
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.960
I became the face of partying
during the pandemic.

32
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.120
I was the only one who got slammed.

33
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.880
My agent calls me.
"Don't bring it up in the podcast."

34
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.840
So. I bring it up in the podcast.

35
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.080
You know that famous press conference
that Stefan Löfven held.

36
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
the "no more partying" press conference…

37
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.440
It's about me.

38
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.000
Just say my fucking name. Stefan.

39
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.360
That's not how you want
your prime minister to see you.

40
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.000
You'd like him to see you winning the
UN Peace Prize or some shit like that.

41
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.600
No. he sees me
throwing all caution to the wind.

42
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.040
So. my only hobby. which was drinking.
went up in smoke before my eyes.

43
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.920
So what do you do in a pandemic?
Do I need a new hobby now?

44
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.360
People got new hobbies
during the pandemic.

45
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.640
People have started playing padel
and having kids and stuff like that.

46
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.080
I thought.
"What the hell should I do? What now?"

47
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.440
I ended up standing on a stage…

48
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.720
…wearing a dragon costume…

49
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.640
I don't deserve any applause. I must say.

50
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.040
For those of you who don't know
what I'm talking about. I hope you don't…

51
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.440
I was in <i>Masked Singer.</i> season one.

52
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.800
Wow. thanks.

53
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.080
Absolutely the worst thing
I've done in my entire life.

54
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.320
I never agreed to do it.

55
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.000
I met the producer the other week.
She said. "I don't recall you saying yes."

56
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.720
"No!"

57
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.840
"Because I fucking didn't!
Suddenly. I was just there."

58
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.240
It's the worst thing I've ever done.

59
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.600
But I've never felt as skinny
as when people thought I was Anja Pärson.

60
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.480
"Fuck yeah!" I took a look in the mirror…

61
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.080
I mean… "Okay. I've lost some weight."

62
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.920
Thinking that I'm Anja Pärson

63
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.040
is like thinking that
Leif GW Persson will ever not be tired.

64
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.240
It's never going to happen.

65
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.440
Poor Anja.

66
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
She got a comment on Instagram.

67
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.840
"Wow. you're the dragon in <i>Masked Singer</i>."

68
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.440
There's a fucking heffalump on stage.

69
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.720
To think that I am her… It's like saying
your best quality is being kind.

70
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.800
She feels horrible about this.
She's posting content on YouTube.

71
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.360
It was completely horrible.

72
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.200
But I think I did it because I had. and
still have. a bit of an identity crisis.

73
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.720
I think I've been kidnapped.

74
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.800
Strange reaction.

75
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.440
I think my parents kidnapped me.
I'll tell you why.

76
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.560
A few years ago. a friend of mine
had been prescribed a new medication

77
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.680
and wanted to check her medical records.

78
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.280
I was in hospital as a kid. I'm allergic
to different things and I take medication.

79
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.480
So I know there's stuff about me
in the records.

80
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.440
So. I thought I'd have a look.
just for fun.

81
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.680
I logged into the online healthcare
platform. There's nothing there.

82
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.120
Not one single fucking record.
I immediately got suspicious.

83
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.120
I called my mom. I'll give that old hag
a piece of my mind. I thought.

84
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.280
So. I called her.
"Hi. darling. how are you?"

85
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.160
I was like. "Well. hello…

86
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.560
…Anette.

87
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.520
Hope all is good with you.

88
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.760
Just one little question…

89
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.040
My medical records.
Let's talk about them. Where are they?"

90
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.240
My mom works in healthcare.

91
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.000
so. she said. "You have to request
your medical records."

92
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.760
So. I believed her.
I called the healthcare advice line.

93
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.160
I spoke to this super nice woman.
Birgitta. We clicked immediately.

94
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.280
Finally. I said. "Hey. Birgitta…

95
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.480
Don't you think I should just…
get those records?"

96
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.000
She said. "Of course you
should have your medical records."

97
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.680
So. I gave her
my personal identification number.

98
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.440
but suddenly it went quiet.

99
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.600
I said. "Hello? Birgitta?
Are you still there?"

100
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.680
Then she said to me. "Johanna. I'm sorry.
but you don't have any records."

101
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.400
"Come on. darling Birgitta…

102
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.400
Call Lena at the hospital in Vasterås.
I've been in hospital. I'm sure."

103
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.200
She said. "I'm sorry. There's nothing
I can do." And she hangs up.

104
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.240
This is when I start working
for the Security Service.

105
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.240
I start an investigation.

106
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.600
I start calling up friends and family.
I call my grandma.

107
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.720
"Don't you remember
when I was in hospital?"

108
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.640
She's like. "No. Johanna.
You've never been in hospital."

109
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.120
I'm sorry. but that little bitch

110
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.400
remembers when my sister
got a tetanus shot.

111
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.600
but when I'm in hospital
for three days she gets Alzheimer's.

112
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.440
I call my dad. "You remember
when I was in hospital. right?"

113
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.240
"Johanna. you've dreamed this.
It never happened."

114
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.840
"It did. You gave me candy.

115
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.960
I hope it was you.
otherwise it was some other old fucker."

116
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.680
Suddenly. I get a text from my uncle.
"Stop digging around in this. Johanna."

117
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.560
I'm quite sure I'll keep digging.
just so you know. Mats.

118
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.120
The thing is.
I've been in hospital my whole life.

119
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.320
No. of course not my whole life.
but many times.

120
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.200
I am in the hospital right now actually.
I have to get back right after the show.

121
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.840
I have an infusion drip backstage.

122
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.760
I've been in hospital many times.
I've been allergic and on medication.

123
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.400
I've been allergic to tomatoes
my entire life.

124
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.160
But no one has ever wanted to
talk about that at home.

125
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.280
I'd ask my parents. "When did I
become allergic to tomatoes?"

126
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.440
"Well…"

127
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.040
Totally psychotic.

128
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.560
But I remember going on vacation
to Portugal. I had tomatoes there.

129
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.400
Big Portuguese tomatoes.
tomato soup. ketchup…

130
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.200
I remember it so damn well.
But after that trip. it just goes black.

131
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.080
On the tomato front.

132
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.240
Which means…

133
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.680
…that before you…

134
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.800
…stands…

135
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.760
…Madeleine McCann.

136
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.040
I am Madeleine McCann!

137
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.960
I think I look like her.

138
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.000
I have stood in front of a mirror
making the same face.

139
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.200
Oh. boy! Oh. boy!

140
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.520
Ow. ow. ow!

141
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.560
It's me. goddamnit!

142
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.760
I've been saying it since last fall.
but the police haven't taken me in.

143
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.000
I can see there is something
wrong with me. and I know what it is.

144
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.760
I've got a mirror. don't worry about that.

145
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.320
But I've always… I was a strange kid.

146
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.800
The only thing I ever wanted was pet fish.

147
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.000
That was the only thing.
It's worse than stick insects.

148
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.640
But I got three fish. I was so happy.

149
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.440
I brought them home. gave them names

150
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.160
and sat and watched them.
since they don't do much.

151
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.360
I bragged about them in school. I said.

152
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.520
"I've got pet fish."

153
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.480
"And we have dignity. Get lost."

154
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.040
When I got home from school.
my three pet fish were on the floor.

155
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.760
They had jumped out of the fish tank.

156
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.000
But moms do as moms do… I mean. "Mom".

157
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.840
We went and bought three new pet fish.
"Who cares about those fish?"

158
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.680
I'm so happy. I brag in school.

159
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.720
Someone throws rocks at me.
I can't remember.

160
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.280
I get home from school.

161
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.320
Same thing again.
My three new fish are on the floor.

162
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.400
Six pet fish committed suicide.

163
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.320
We know that murders and psychopaths

164
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.440
systematically torture
and kill animals as kids.

165
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.360
So. I've been standing outside the
Hinseberg Women's Prison: "Let me in!"

166
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.200
"I am one of you."

167
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.360
I think I'm the next Arboga woman.
Seriously.

168
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.080
The thing is. a friend of me
got a fish for his 18th birthday.

169
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.000
He wasn't very popular.

170
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.440
He's not from Stockholm.
so. he was going to visit his parents.

171
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.880
He asked me. "Johanna. could you please…

172
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.160
…be my fish sitter?"

173
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.440
He had no idea about my fish problems.

174
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.400
I wasn't going to tell him.

175
00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.560
And really. it's not such a hard task.

176
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.240
"You just have to feed it.
You don't need to be there."

177
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.800
"Trust me. I'll be there."

178
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.880
So. I take sick leave for a week.

179
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.880
I sit there and watch the fish…
I sit there and talk to the fish.

180
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.400
"Please don't jump.
please don't jump. please…"

181
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.760
But the fish survived.
It was the happiest day of my life.

182
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.360
I called my mom.

183
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.760
Oh. thank you.

184
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400
Wow!

185
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.840
You set the bar pretty low for applause.
You don't give me much credit. do you?

186
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.680
I called my mom and said.

187
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.400
"Mom. the fish survived.
There's nothing wrong with me."

188
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.480
My mom said to me. "That's great to hear."

189
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.360
"But there's just one little thing
that I need to tell you."

190
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.040
So. my mom told me.

191
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.280
"Your pet fish…
They didn't commit suicide.

192
00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.680
It was the cat."

193
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.720
"So. you thought it was better to say it
was suicide than to say it was the cat?"

194
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.680
"Are you stupid?"
After that I hate all cats.

195
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:13.000
No wonder the Palme murder is unsolved.
It was a fucking cat.

196
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.440
That's why I'm so into the police.

197
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:26.200
Either I'll end up behind bars
or as a police officer.

198
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.760
Those are my options.

199
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.200
The conservatives want
3.000 more police officers.

200
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.600
Oh no. We need 3.000 new police officers.
Out with the old. in with the new.

201
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.960
Have you seen the police officers we have?

202
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.320
We have police officers who are on TikTok.

203
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.720
This man roams our streets freely.

204
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.400
When I first saw this.
I was clinically dead.

205
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.520
But I thought. "It's just one video.
He was on break and he was bored."

206
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.800
No. there's more.

207
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.560
Look at that face.

208
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.120
How is he?

209
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.040
I'd rather have "Captain Skirt"
come save me than this fucking idiot.

210
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.480
Imagine calling the police.
and then this guy turns up.

211
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.360
"I just need to make a TikTok first."

212
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.040
Savage Love the killer to death.

213
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.800
I love crime shows.
I like <i>Beck.</i> Do you like <i>Beck?</i>

214
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.080
Okay!

215
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.680
I love <i>Beck.</i> I watched it as a kid.

216
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.800
It wasn't as if dad put it on when I was
two. <i>Beck - The Girl in the Root Cellar.</i>

217
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.280
"Gunvald would be nice to fuck."

218
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.320
I don't know what my real parents
have showed me. But…

219
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.600
All my friends watched Disney
and shit like that. Not me.

220
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.640
I mean. I watched Ariel.

221
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.400
I did.

222
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.320
I mean. I watched Ariel.
but only because I liked Ursula so much.

223
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.200
She's the only character
who realizes that Ariel is a bitch.

224
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.720
She's got some go in her.

225
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.320
And I love Mikael Persbrandt.

226
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.320
Mm.

227
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.520
He's my future husband. He is.

228
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.920
I know that and he knows it too.

229
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.560
I don't talk about
anything else in interviews.

230
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:03.640
He's got protected identity now.
and adress. which is a shame.

231
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.160
But I keep my spirit up.

232
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.840
I remember in second grade.
we had to draw our idols.

233
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.240
All we did was drawing.
I still can't even draw a circle.

234
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.600
And my classmates drew people
like Marcoolio or Michael Jackson.

235
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.640
I drew Micke P.

236
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.680
I've never been so thorough
in my entire life.

237
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.360
I sat there drawing carefully.

238
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.760
My teacher walked around
looking at everybody's drawings.

239
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.840
E-Type and stuff like that.

240
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.240
Who would draw E-Type?

241
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.840
Likely idol…

242
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.160
My teacher walked up to me and said…

243
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.080
"Johanna.

244
00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.480
what is this?"

245
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.600
I was like…

246
00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.480
"It's Micke P."

247
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.480
"Doesn't he look good naked?"

248
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.800
It's not normal to draw
Mikael Persbrandt naked in second grade.

249
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.000
I wasn't normal.

250
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.720
I was fucking awful in school.
I was worse than "Hyper-Adam".

251
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.480
We all had a "Hyper-Adam" in our class.

252
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.400
I was worse than him. Get it?

253
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.640
I've thought about
all the school subjects.

254
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.600
Like home economics.
What the hell was that?

255
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.280
You ate. That's all you did.
I had a teacher called Lisbeth.

256
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.080
She wore Birkenstocks.
used the cookbook as an accessory

257
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.200
and was skipping between the classrooms.

258
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.440
And you could behave so badly in
home economics without being told off.

259
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.280
I'd burn the scones. Lisbeth would say.

260
00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.520
"Next time. just bake them
for 10 minutes instead of 15."

261
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.880
"Okay."

262
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.000
I'd break the stove. Lisbeth would say.

263
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.720
"You'll just have to call the repairman."

264
00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.480
I'd burn down
the whole goddamned classroom.

265
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.640
Lisbeth was excited when the firemen came.

266
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.480
You could behave
so badly without being told off.

267
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.200
But if you washed dishes
under running water…

268
00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.600
…all hell would be let loose!

269
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.760
The social services would be called in
and you'd have to spend Christmas away.

270
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.200
And I think because
I was such a strange kid myself.

271
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.240
I hate kids.

272
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.840
I hate kids. Period.

273
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.840
Partly because I was a strange kid.
but also because of my first stand-up gig.

274
00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.480
My first stand-up gig was
for the Young Allergics Association.

275
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.800
It's social suicide. for sure.

276
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.880
My friend William Spetz

277
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.520
was asked if he could do stand-up
at their conference.

278
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.960
They we're to be 18 to 35 years old.
they would be drinking and in a good mood.

279
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.640
They asked him if he could do
40 minutes of stand-up.

280
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.920
He said. "No. I've never done stand-up.
I can't do 40 minutes.

281
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.240
But a friend of mine would love to try.
Maybe we could do 20 minutes each."

282
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.040
So. I said yes to this.
May I add that this was in Örebro.

283
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.880
A fucking shithole.

284
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
I was excited
about finally doing stand-up.

285
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.280
so write 20 minutes of material about
how much I hate people who are allergic.

286
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.480
We go there. I walk in.

287
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.440
and I see 30 pairs of shoes
in the size for 10-year-olds.

288
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.840
"What the hell is going on?"

289
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.960
William had just done the Swedish
Eurovision. so kids are running at us…

290
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.040
"Move. fatso!"
"What the hell is going on?!"

291
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.480
We had been duped.

292
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.120
We're at a camp
for kids who don't have any friends.

293
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.320
Kids who say. "Are you allergic
to flowers too?" That's where we're at.

294
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.000
I think. "I've written 20 minutes
about how much I hate these kids."

295
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.200
"I can't say this. I just can't."

296
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.160
But I did anyway.

297
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.960
The first thing I say is that
I think peanut allergics should die.

298
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.040
Felix on front row starts crying.

299
00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.280
Then I say. "You know when you suck cock…"

300
00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.520
No!

301
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.000
They're 10 years old. Johanna.
Are you stupid?

302
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.520
Also. we had to stay there overnight.

303
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.920
Imagine the atmosphere over breakfast.
It wasn't great.

304
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.640
So. I'm not really fond of kids. Sue me.

305
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.080
Which isn't great.
because my sister has two kids.

306
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.720
I thought one would have been enough.

307
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.480
But she decided to
squeeze another one out.

308
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.280
Saying that. I like the new kid more.

309
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.760
She's five months old.
She doesn't talk. It's brilliant.

310
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.000
The other one is 4.5 years.
She doesn't get irony.

311
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.840
We just stand there looking at each other.

312
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.280
"Move."

313
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.080
My sister was crazy when she was pregnant.

314
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.280
She swallowed all the pregnancy myths.

315
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.240
She'd come to me and say.
"Johanna… Check out my pregnancy glow."

316
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.800
"Yes. you're sweating.

317
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.280
You're dripping. I mean…"

318
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.080
"Look at my hair.
it's so long and thick and shiny."

319
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.320
"It's greasy. Emelie.

320
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.640
You haven't showered for nine months."

321
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.160
"Look. my breasts are so big."

322
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.240
"You look like a milk cow."

323
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.040
Totally crazy. Now. she wants to become
the new Greta and save the world.

324
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.920
I mean. we all have dreams and goals.
but there has to be some limit.

325
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.120
She's started talking about
joining the donor register.

326
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.360
Are you in the donor register?
Clap your hands.

327
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.520
There's a few of you.

328
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.720
I can see you looking…
I am coming for you.

329
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.440
How old are you? 23.

330
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.960
How long have you been
in the donor register?

331
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.160
Three years. Why did you join?

332
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.520
You don't know?

333
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.400
Perfect.

334
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.240
What did you say?

335
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.600
"You are supposed to."

336
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.600
Is that how you decide on everything?
"You are supposed to."

337
00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.440
It's a pretty big decision
to let people carve you up.

338
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.240
Have you been kidnapped too?
It's like we have…

339
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.800
Oh well.

340
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.160
Is it mostly for the sake
of your conscience…?

341
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.960
So. what else have you signed up for?

342
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.120
KP? WWF?

343
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.920
Do you donate money every month?
No. you don't. I can tell.

344
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.920
To Bianca Ingrosso perhaps.

345
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.880
To CAIA.

346
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.720
Incredible. Thanks.

347
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.600
Thanks! Good to have you with us.
I'm not in the donor register.

348
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.960
I'll tell you why
I'm not in the donor register.

349
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.960
Research shows that
the person who receives your organ

350
00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.080
might inherit
needs and emotions from the donor.

351
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.680
And I refuse to expose
someone to my organs.

352
00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.280
Imagine getting my liver.

353
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.920
You'd be screwed from the start.

354
00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.720
Take someone else's. Take Jockiboi's.

355
00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.000
He's got every diagnosis that exists
and drops his baby down the stairs…

356
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.000
He won't hear this anyway. It's fine.

357
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.600
He's out chasing ghosts. With Laxton.

358
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.280
I can't donate. because I've got thoughts
that nobody should have.

359
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.040
-For example. do you like seafood?
-Yes!

360
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.520
I love seafood.

361
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.080
But I think eating seafood
is a bit like having anal sex.

362
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.120
Hello?

363
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.440
I think it's quite a stretch
from idea to action.

364
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.360
A lot of work…

365
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.480
…for very little pleasure. I mean…

366
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.960
Only women applauding.

367
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.120
"That's right. Anton!"

368
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.960
I'll be standing around
in the evening and just…

369
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.480
"Can I be bothered tonight?
Is it worth it?"

370
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.320
And your hands smell so bad…

371
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:28.040
You just want a wet wipe.
A lemon-scented wet wipe.

372
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.200
"Got a condom?" "No. take
a lemon-scented wet wipe instead."

373
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.800
Other thoughts that no one else should
have. or it would be a danger for society.

374
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.200
People have amazing thoughts. but not me.

375
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.840
My matter of the heart is… the carrot…

376
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.240
…inside…

377
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.200
…the carrot.

378
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:56.200
There is actually a carrot
inside the carrot…

379
00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.840
…that is so fucking tasty!
It's completely fucking insane.

380
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:10.760
You bite around the carrot. and a tiny
little stem appears. so fragile.

381
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.600
"It's you and me against the world.
Don't ever leave me."

382
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:19.720
It's so sweet. It's like a Kinder egg.
for fuck's sake. It's the best concept.

383
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.160
The carrot inside the carrot is
a bit like guys who are circumcised…

384
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.200
…in that they've removed the bad part…

385
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.720
…but kept the good part.

386
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.040
When you sleep with someone
who's circumcised. you don't need to…

387
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.840
…pull it out. clean it…

388
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.640
…remove the dirt…
I mean. you don't need to do that.

389
00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.640
I also can't donate my organs
becaus I was born in the 90s.

390
00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.880
I take it there are more
90s children here.

391
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.960
That's right.

392
00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.920
We 90s children. we're the worst…

393
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.120
…that was put on this planet.

394
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.320
We who were born in the 90s say.
"I've got a French balcony."

395
00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.800
And they're like.
"It's a big window. Shut up."

396
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.840
90s children think Malala is Simba's mom.
That's where we're at.

397
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.160
90s children become influencers.
That's what we are.

398
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:35.000
We have influencers
who call themselves entrepreneurs.

399
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.720
Let that sink in.

400
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.000
They call themselves entrepreneurs
when they make mobile phone covers

401
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.400
with Ideal of Sweden.

402
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.560
Marble on every single one of them.

403
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.680
What would you rather answer for.
the Palme murder or a marble cover?

404
00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.200
To call yourself an entrepreneur when you
make phone covers with Ideal of Sweden.

405
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.880
is like saying that someone that
works for Foodora works with spinning.

406
00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.200
We have such high thoughts of ourselves.

407
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.480
I saw a show called <i>Catfish.</i>

408
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.440
It's about people who've been together
forever without ever meeting.

409
00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.560
There was a guy on the show.
He'd had a girlfriend for ten years.

410
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.560
They were engaged but had never met.

411
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.560
Two guys came to help him find
this person. and get them to meet.

412
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.240
They asked him. "Why haven't you met?"

413
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.040
He was like. "No. she's too busy."

414
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.680
Spontaneous reaction: in ten years?

415
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.680
I'm sure you'd be able
to find a little gap in the schedule?

416
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.800
They were like. "Okay.
But have you spoken over the phone?"

417
00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.400
He was like.
"No. but I've heard her voice."

418
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:57.000
They were like. "What the hell is this?
Tell us who the girl is."

419
00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.080
He says. "You won't believe me."

420
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.840
"It's Katy Perry." Sure…

421
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.600
Most likely to be with Katy Perry. Not.

422
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.560
We think so much of ourselves. If we're
not influencers we'll do whatever else.

423
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.360
I met a guy at a party. and somehow
he started talking about himself.

424
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.240
That never happens.

425
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.800
We started talking about work.
I said. "I'm a comedian."

426
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.080
He said. "That's weird."

427
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.920
I said. "Thanks."

428
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.360
So. I asked him what he did.

429
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.360
He said. "I do beatboxing."

430
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.200
"I'm sorry? I didn't mean your hobby.
What do you do for work?"

431
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.920
"That is my job."

432
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.840
"Okay. you play drums with your mouth.
That's what you do."

433
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.040
He told me he sees
an "air coach" once a week.

434
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.600
Because
"breathing is important in the drop".

435
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.920
No one can hear the difference.
He wanted to be the best in the world.

436
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.400
There are only two people doing it.
it's not that hard.

437
00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.240
Then he told me he was releasing a demo.

438
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.120
"Would you like to hear it?"

439
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.080
"No."

440
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.080
I didn't say that.

441
00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:27.320
I said. "I haven't got any
headphones. Sorry. dude."

442
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.640
Then he said.
"I can do it live if you want."

443
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.080
Right.

444
00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.960
So. for three minutes I stood there.

445
00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.400
hoping that
he would have an asthma attack.

446
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.760
How do you groove along to beatboxing?

447
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.520
I stood there… "I'll have to sway a bit.
I'll sway a bit."

448
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.480
Then I thought. "I'll raise an arm."
I raised an arm.

449
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.040
I thought. "I'm too quiet."

450
00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.280
So I started going. "Yeah."

451
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.760
"Uh-huh."

452
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.720
"Skrrt." Yeah. you know.

453
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.280
I've never felt so white
in my entire life.

454
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.800
I've never grooved along to beatboxing.
It's like watching horseback riding.

455
00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.960
What the hell are you supposed to say?

456
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.800
"Nice jump."

457
00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.320
It was like a hostage situation
without a gun.

458
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.880
I felt like a cobra coming up
from a bucket. Seriously.

459
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.360
Get this. You have a son.

460
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.000
One day he comes home. "Mom. all I want
for my birthday is an air coach."

461
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.480
"Do you know something. David?

462
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.040
I'll give you an air rifle
so you can shoot yourself in the head."

463
00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.280
But we had sex.

464
00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.640
So. you know…

465
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.880
No. this was…

466
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.480
This was too…

467
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.360
So the curtains are red here? I see…

468
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.560
I'm actually struggling
to look you in the eye.

469
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.800
I'm a bit ashamed.

470
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.720
But it went well. He followed me
all the way home. which was nice.

471
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.440
We went inside and I locked the door.

472
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.280
I said. "You're not going anywhere."

473
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.400
"You can beatbox
me to death for all I care."

474
00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:52.200
We were going to have sex
and so. you know. there's the foreplay…

475
00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.720
You're supposed to suck cock.

476
00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.720
There are things I enjoy more.
just so you know…

477
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.440
…but I'm just human.

478
00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.680
So I did it. I got down on my knees…

479
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.040
I won't look anyone in the eye now.
just so you know.

480
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.280
I won't do that.

481
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.800
But I got down on my knees.
prepared for the usual.

482
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.440
not being able to breathe.

483
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.840
throwing up. getting whiplash injury…

484
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.200
I was prepared for it all.

485
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.560
So. I sat down and…

486
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.200
…"got to work" doesn't sound right.

487
00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:47.320
I got the party started.
That's better. I got the party started.

488
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.040
After a while. I suddenly feel a hand…

489
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.040
…on…

490
00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.280
You bet.

491
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.280
…my…

492
00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.240
…head…

493
00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.440
And it starts to knead.

494
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.880
I'm going like this
and he's going like this. It's like this.

495
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.360
Like a fucking tornado.
"What the hell is going on?!"

496
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.400
I didn't dare to say. "Stop! My body!"

497
00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.200
I thought.
"We're having such a good time."

498
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.040
So. it just keeps going.
After a while I've got the rhythm down.

499
00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.920
Play "La Macarena". Let's fucking roll!

500
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:42.680
But it made me dizzy. you know.
I was like. "Where have I ended up?"

501
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.280
"Am I with my real parents?"
I was starting to…

502
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.160
After a while I thought. "I need to
know what's going on down here."

503
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.960
I realized that I was sat down
there with my mouth full…

504
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.360
…getting a hair massage.

505
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.120
We're not in a fucking spa.

506
00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.520
If I had jerked him off. my other hand
would have gotten a hand massage.

507
00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.080
The 69…
"Could I have some foot massage. please."

508
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.880
This has marked me for life.

509
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.520
So. now when I go to the hairdresser
and they start shampooing my hair…

510
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:37.000
Afterwards. I found out that
I had either chlamydia or a UTI.

511
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.200
As it turned out. I had both.

512
00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.760
I had to order a chlamydia test.
because I refuse to see a gynecologist.

513
00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.120
I won't look her in the eye
and tell her I've been partying. I refuse.

514
00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.040
So. I ordered a chlamydia test
and received it in a plain white envelope.

515
00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.520
One chlamydia test and one condom.

516
00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.760
No note.

517
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.280
What a bloody statement.

518
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.280
"Here you are. little hooker."

519
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.520
But stupid as I am.
I spilled the contents of the test tube.

520
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.720
so I had to order a new one.

521
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.640
Same thing again: a plain white envelope.
one chlamydia test and three condoms.

522
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.680
Can you imagine
how they must have fucking talked?

523
00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.200
Next time I'll get a dildo.

524
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.240
With a note. "Stop sleeping around."

525
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:35.520
It's like selling Christmas magazines.
The more you sell. the better the rewards.

526
00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:41.400
Next time I will get a "Satisfy Pro".
It will be great.

527
00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.280
The timing wasn't great.

528
00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.600
I don't know if the timing
is ever great to get Chlamydia.

529
00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.800
But I was going to Costa Rica…

530
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.280
…to learn how to surf.

531
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.440
I had been really busy with work.
I was really tired.

532
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.920
I needed to find the calm.
find myself. and so on.

533
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.520
It takes 34 hours to travel to Costa Rica.

534
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.880
The calm was gone already in London.

535
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.800
When I arrive. the girls
are wearing tank tops and shorts.

536
00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.680
They're having muesli for snacks.

537
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:26.240
"Perfect. I've got two minutes to lose
40 kg. This is going to be wonderful."

538
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.560
The first thing they ask is.
"Have you been surfing before?"

539
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.000
"What do you think? I look like a bowler."

540
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.200
On the first day we wake up
at 05.30 to do yoga.

541
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.280
Yoga for me is sleeping.

542
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.640
lighting a candle and juggling mangoes.

543
00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.920
We had to stand in downward dog.
the plank with your bum in the air.

544
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.880
for 45 minutes. and breathe.

545
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.200
I can tell you I was gasping for air.

546
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.920
There was a surf guarantee.

547
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.080
"100% chance
that you'll learn how to surf."

548
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.840
It was on the website. "100% chance
that you'll learn how to surf."

549
00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.040
They've had to change it to 99%.

550
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.160
Surfers are the worst people
I've ever met.

551
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.440
They would get up in the morning…
"Today. I took some green waves."

552
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.760
"And I took ecstasy. Shut up."

553
00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.000
It was horrible.

554
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.080
I went there to find myself.
I didn't have a clue where I was.

555
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.440
When I got home. I was like.
"What do I do now? Read the horoscopes?"

556
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.120
Anyone read the horoscopes in here?
Clap your hands.

557
00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.680
Yes. 3.000 retards.

558
00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.920
Thanks for coming.

559
00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.680
I read the horoscopes too.

560
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.560
I'm with you. although I'm not sure
you want to be in my category.

561
00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.200
I love horoscopes. I love the idea that
something good will happen at some point.

562
00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.360
Somebody just got sacked.

563
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.320
I love horoscopes. but not
when they're about planets and shit.

564
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.440
I don't care. I want to know.
one. does anyone fancy me?

565
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.800
Two. will I get rich?

566
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.760
Three. will my real parents ever find me?

567
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.720
That's the only thing
I really want to know.

568
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.840
I went to a
fortuneteller a few months ago.

569
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.040
And the first thing she tells me is…

570
00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.680
"I can see…you sitting in a house…

571
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.040
…alone."

572
00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.200
"I've paid for an hour.
This is going to be fun."

573
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.640
"No. no. You'll like it."

574
00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.000
"I guess I haven't got
a bloody choice. do I?"

575
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.880
Then we got to the fun bit
where I had to ask yes or no questions.

576
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:12.720
"I have the answers…" No. she said.
"I can talk to the angels."

577
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.000
How easy.

578
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.640
I'm not sure you can make
a Wi-Fi call up there.

579
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.200
She said. "Ask a yes or no
question and I'll answer it."

580
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:28.720
I took it seriously. "Okay. I'll ask
questions that I really want answered."

581
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.520
So. I said.
"Will I ever be a police officer?"

582
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:38.120
She got her tarot cards out.
"Oh. are we playing Uno now?"

583
00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.720
She said.
"I'm going to lay the cards out.

584
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.920
If there are 13 cards. that means no.

585
00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.040
Less than 13 cards means yes."

586
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.000
"Okay. whatever. Go ahead. Do your thing."

587
00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.480
She lays the cards out and goes. "Hmm."

588
00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.480
"Yes. There are 13 cards…

589
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.640
…so that means no."

590
00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.600
"I saw you counting them! I'm not stupid!"

591
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.680
Then she says to me.
"You're dating the wrong guys."

592
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.000
"Thanks. I know! I dated
a guy who lived in a trailer. Please…"

593
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.880
It's true.
I dated a guy who lived in a trailer.

594
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.080
This was when I lived in Västerås.
my hometown.

595
00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:29.000
I was out in a bar.
He came up to me and said.

596
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.720
"Wanna come back to my place?"

597
00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.600
I thought.
"I won't get that question again.

598
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.680
So. here's me saying yes to life."

599
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.720
So. we get on a bus.

600
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.840
Number 309 towards Höganäs.
never heard of the fucking bus.

601
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.360
We travel for 20 minutes. 30 minutes…

602
00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.000
If you invite someone back to your place.
you have to live in the city.

603
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.800
You can't expect me to cross the border
to have fun in a week from now.

604
00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.360
So. we're on the bus.
we reach a dirt road. It's dark.

605
00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.040
He says. "We're getting off here."

606
00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.520
"Are you sure?"

607
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.160
"Yes. Get off."

608
00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:12.880
"Okay. great. I'm going to be
kidnapped again. How wonderful."

609
00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.760
-l love you!
-Thanks.

610
00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.040
That's probably him.

611
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.000
Thank you for coming.

612
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.080
So. we get off the bus. It's pitch black.

613
00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.040
I realize there's no point
even trying to run away from him.

614
00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.160
Do you know how slow I run?

615
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.880
A trot is my fastest pace.

616
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.000
It's pitch-black.

617
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.960
He gets a flashlight
out of his coat pocket.

618
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.960
He brought a flashlight to the bar!

619
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.320
Sends off a red flag if anything.

620
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.160
There we are like two blind people.
"What's going on?"

621
00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.400
We get to the trailer park.
He says. "This is where I live."

622
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.720
Okay…

623
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.400
"Maybe you could have said that before."

624
00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.240
But we continued
seeing each other. weirdly enough.

625
00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.760
It was a bit hard
telling my parents where he lived.

626
00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.520
I don't know why.
maybe it had to do with pride.

627
00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.360
One night. my parents
asked me what I was doing.

628
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.920
I said. "I'm going to Felix' place."

629
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.440
"Felix. he lives
in the countryside. right?"

630
00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.160
"Sort of. It's a bit further out."

631
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.480
"Do you want a ride?"

632
00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.360
"Hell. no!
I'll take the bus towards Höganäs."

633
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.000
"Does he live in a villa. or…?"

634
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:49.680
"Well. it's not really a villa…
There's only one floor."

635
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.960
"Okay. a bungalow?"
"Well. I wouldn't say that…"

636
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.880
"Okay. a row house?"

637
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.160
"There are definitely houses in a row."

638
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.840
"So. it's an apartment? Come on. what…?"

639
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.840
"It's an apartment on wheels.
what can I say?"

640
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.920
"You're dating a homeless person.
Well done. Congratulations."

641
00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:19.400
This guy had so many red flags.
He also loved rosehip soup.

642
00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.760
Why not break up at that point? Seriously.

643
00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.120
One evening I was going
to his place and he wrote to me.

644
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.000
"Johanna. could you please…

645
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.960
…buy some rosehip soup on the way?"

646
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.440
"Of course my guy
is getting rosehip soup!"

647
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.560
I don't usually go to actual food stores.

648
00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.560
because people working there
are too engaged in us shoppers.

649
00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.880
And I suck at finding stuff
and don't like to ask.

650
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.680
But I went in and tried to find the soup.

651
00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.640
I haven't a clue.
Is rosehip soup hot or cold?

652
00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.480
Is it with dairy. or jelly?

653
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.200
I search like crazy. but I can't find it.
Okay. I'll just have to ask.

654
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.760
I just have to ask.

655
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.760
I see a girl working in the store.

656
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.760
I go up to her and say.
"Why. hello there…"

657
00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.440
I definitely didn't say that.
Why would I say that?

658
00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.000
I guess I said… "Hello." "Hi."

659
00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.920
And she said. "Hello."

660
00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.400
The conversation
definitely wasn't this long.

661
00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.760
I said. "May I ask you a question?"

662
00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.120
She said.
"Yes of course. ask me anything."

663
00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.600
So I said. "Well…"

664
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.400
"The rosehip soup. where is it?
Just tell me the isle."

665
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.440
"Right! Let's go to the rosehip soup!"

666
00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:55.000
She's walking 15 meters ahead of me.
It's a walk of shame in the store.

667
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.480
"You don't have to drag me to Narnia.
Are you stupid?"

668
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.320
Just tell me which aisle it is!
It's such a brag.

669
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.200
And I also hate going to Systembolaget.

670
00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.480
I just want the booze to come to me.

671
00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.680
But I was going to a dinner.
probably with this bloody trailer guy.

672
00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.880
And when you turn 20.

673
00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.160
you need to bring wine
or flowers or some crap like that.

674
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:31.280
So I go into Systembolaget
to buy some wine.

675
00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.080
I go to the wine shelf.

676
00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.600
I don't know wine. I go for
the nicest bottles. the most expensive.

677
00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.440
I'm looking at a bottle.
and a lady comes up beside me.

678
00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:44.160
She's like…
"Hmm. I was just looking at that wine."

679
00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.960
"Oh?"

680
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.240
"Do you know if it goes well with meat?"

681
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.720
I have no clue. I drink
Red Bull and vodka in the weekends.

682
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:09.280
It's like Penny Parnevik
asking her parents about birth control.

683
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.920
She's got fifteen million siblings.

684
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:22.360
As you've understood.
I have been single most of my life.

685
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:26.440
Now. I've found myself a guy.
I don't know how.

686
00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.600
Oh. thank you.

687
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.680
He is gonna leave me soon but that's ok.

688
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.360
I'll stay put.

689
00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.800
I was single for a very long time.

690
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:49.080
I am really bad at dating.
Do you have Tinder?

691
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.720
Not so many out of ten thousand.

692
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.440
If I find out later you have Tinder.
I'll kill every single one of you.

693
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.200
Because what I'm about to tell you now
is pretty rough. I had Tinder…

694
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.080
I had Tinder Gold.

695
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.280
That was a sneer. I heard that.

696
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:20.960
Tinder Gold lets you see who's liked you.
letting you choose.

697
00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.840
And you can go abroad.

698
00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.800
In the app. I'm not an escort.

699
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:35.720
Tinder Gold costs 200 kronor a month.
It costs more than electricity.

700
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.120
I could've saved five kids a month.
according to Unicef.

701
00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.040
No. that's not for me.

702
00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:48.320
My reason for getting Tinder Gold
was that I would save a lot of time.

703
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.320
Yeah right. saving time by
swiping around in Australia.

704
00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.880
But when I started dating
my current boyfriend I was crazy.

705
00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.400
I get completely crazy when dating.

706
00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.920
If he didn't reply for ten minutes…

707
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.560
I went bananas.

708
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:12.400
Completely bananas. I could be
standing with a friend. and like…

709
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.640
"Okay."

710
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.600
"Okay!"

711
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.920
"Okay. then!"

712
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.080
"It's over.
That's the end of that. Oh well."

713
00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.960
And my friend was like.
"Here we fucking go again."

714
00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:38.440
And she was like.
"Johanna. have you spoken today. or…?"

715
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.880
And I was like. "Yes. we have spoken.

716
00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:47.960
But are we talking now?
No. we aren't talking now.. are we?"

717
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.000
"Okay. but if you have spoken today.
you might know what he's doing."

718
00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.320
"Yes.

719
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.160
He's at a fucking funeral.

720
00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.880
He's at a fucking funeral.
Felicia's gone and died.

721
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.920
And he's bought flowers for her.

722
00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.320
Will he buy flowers for me?
No. But for Felicia. yes.

723
00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.760
He's fucking her right now.

724
00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:15.880
He's fucking her in doggy style
in the coffin. I just know it."

725
00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:22.080
And my friends. "I think you would've
known if he wanted to fuck corpses."

726
00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.640
"You never know.

727
00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.280
I would've fucked Micke dead or alive.
It makes no difference to me."

728
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.520
Thank you. you're all so nice.

729
00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.760
Before I met my boyfriend.

730
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.000
I've always wondered what it's like
to have sex with someone who's got asthma.

731
00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.360
People always have asthma
up until you have sex.

732
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.160
You've never heard anyone say.
"I've got the inhaler with me."

733
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.280
You've never heard that.

734
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.240
I didn't know my boyfriend has asthma.

735
00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.680
but when you're gonna have sex with
someone you like.

736
00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.960
you want it to be good.

737
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.120
I went all in. I shaved my entire body.

738
00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.520
I moisturized. I ate pineapple for weeks.

739
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.720
I ran to the pharmacy and found…
Well. I didn't run.

740
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:20.520
I walked. rather. to the pharmacy and
found something called coochie deodorant.

741
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.600
No it's not. it's called intimate spray.

742
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.080
I bought a few bottles.
I used the first one.

743
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.000
"No. I'll take the second one too."
I took the third one…

744
00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:34.680
But what I didn't know was
that people with asthma…

745
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.680
…have difficulties with scents…

746
00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.560
…and perfumes.

747
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.280
So. he…

748
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.680
…went down on me…

749
00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.440
…and I suddenly felt
how he started to shake.

750
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:08.280
Which was the greatest thing
I've ever felt in my entire life.

751
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:16.480
You know air pressure vibrators?
I thought. "He's done a course.

752
00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:20.560
He's learned to do it with his mouth.

753
00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:24.520
We've all evolved differently.
and you've evolved perfectly for me."

754
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.000
So. I let him continue
until he started coughing.

755
00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:32.160
Which was something out of this world.

756
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.600
Guys. if you haven't coughed in your
girlfriend's pussy. go home and do it.

757
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.480
Corona is the
best thing that ever happened to me.

758
00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.440
The first Corona outburst.
I was there in a heartbeat.

759
00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:49.000
If someone's coughing on a bus.
"You're coming home with me."

760
00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.960
Anders Tegnell.
"Everyone needs to get vaccinated."

761
00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.840
Fucking misogynist.

762
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:10.840
I also think I'm heterosexual because
I've got a phobia called trypophobia.

763
00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:17.400
It's a phobia where you have
a fear of holes.

764
00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.040
I hate holes.

765
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.320
It feels like things
will be coming out of them.

766
00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.720
Like the TikTok cop.

767
00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:32.240
It feels like if I went down on a girl
and saw it all I would be like. "No!"

768
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.480
She could threaten me with her pussy.

769
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.480
"If you don't take the trash out.
you know what will happen."

770
00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:45.000
I hate holes. all types of holes.

771
00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:50.240
I came home
to my mother and sister to tell them.

772
00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.840
"Sit down. This is important."

773
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.800
I said. "Okay. Um…

774
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.040
I've got trypophobia.

775
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.960
And it's really difficult for me.

776
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.400
And my sister said. "Johanna.

777
00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.480
I've also got trypophobia.

778
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.800
I think it runs in the family."

779
00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:19.160
"Well. I'm from Portugal.
so. I don't know about that."

780
00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:24.920
Thank you. Avicii Arena!
Thank you for coming! You're wonderful!

781
00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.280
Thank you!

782
00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.000
Thank you!
