Full disclosure. Claire.

151
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.351
Your chapter on how Swedenborg
influenced the art of George Inness

152
00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:08.644
is what landed you here.

That's… that's interesting.

154

I struggled with the most.

155
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.860
How so?

00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:21.282

I'm a bit of a cliché. the New York cynic.

That… How a-a painter
as brilliant as Inness

158
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:29.623
could fall for some 18th-century mystic

159
00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:32.001
[chuckles] Well. Swedenborg…

160
00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:35.629
He wasn't just some mystic.

161
00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:39.550
He keenly understood
that everything in the natural world

162
00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:42.094
has a counterpart in the spiritual realm.

163
00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:45.765
And Inness painted landscapes
with this in mind.

164
00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:46.891
I-I get that.

as this grand passage.

the true believer of the family.

174
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.256
Ah. ah.

175
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.759
Well. this is your office right here.

176
00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:26.847
[George chuckles]

177
00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:30.142
[man] I guess I picked
the wrong welcome gift.

178
00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:34.897
[George chuckles]
Well. I… I can't argue with the cover art.

179
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.732
The Valley of the Shadow of Death.

180
00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.860
Ahh. that is George Inness at his best.

181
00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.780
Well. you are now
officially in Inness territory.

182
00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:46.116
Don't be surprised
if you start seeing things his way.

183
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.117
[George chuckles]

184
00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:50.037
Thank you. Floyd.

[knocking on door]

190
00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.241
-[Catherine] Hi.
-Hello.

191
00:14:27.324 --> 00:14:28.284
Mrs. Claire. right?

192
00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.411
Yeah. can I help you?

193
00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:31.954
Uh. yes. ma'am.

194
00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:32.872
Um…

195
00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:36.917
My name's Eddie Lucks.
and this here's my younger brother Cole.

196
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:40.838
We just wanted to introduce ourselves
in case you're in need of a hired hand.

197
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:42.965
We do gardening. carpentry. plumbing.

198
00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:46.135
When it comes to painting.
we're regular Leonardos.

199
00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:47.136
[chuckles]

200
00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:51.223
-Best part of all is. we come real cheap.
-Hey. like my marble?

201
00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:54.018
Yeah. nice.
You want me to show you how to shoot?

202
00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:55.019
[Franny] Mm-hmm.

203
00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:58.314
Oh. I forgot to mention
that Cole is the best babysitter in town.

204
00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:01.400
Yeah. I can see that.
Where do you boys live?

205
00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:02.902
In town with our uncle.

206
00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:05.779
We got plenty of references
if that's what you need.

207
00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:07.907
Okay. Do you have a business card?

208
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.618
-A card? Um…
-[Franny and Cole chatting indistinctly]

209
00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:12.369
Let me see.

210
00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:16.040
Oh. I left my business cards at home.
[chuckles]

211
00:15:17.207 --> 00:15:18.751
-I got a pen.
-[Franny] Yeah!

212
00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:21.170
I think we should just hire them.

213
00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:24.173
Shouldn't we get one more quote?

214
00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:26.008
There's a lot of other
groundskeepers in town.

215
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.635
I already did. and they…

216
00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:29.470
run like half the price.

217
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:35.643
Cath. please don't tell me you're back
on the whole salads-only thing.

218
00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:37.519
I ate a big lunch today.

219
00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.230
What about the protein shakes
the doctor recommended?

220
00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.483
I saw you skipped it this morning.

221
00:15:42.983 --> 00:15:46.195
I am doing them at night now
because it's easier on my stomach.

222
00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:52.743
-Franny. you want some more rice?
-No. I want a pony ride.

223
00:15:52.826 --> 00:15:53.744
[Catherine laughs]

224
00:15:53.827 --> 00:15:55.788
-[Franny] Go. pony. go!
-[George] I am.

225
00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:57.206
[Franny] Go. pony. go!

226
00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:59.959
[George] You are terrorizing.

227
00:16:02.002 --> 00:16:03.963
Oh. look. there's another pony.

228
00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:05.631
Okay. Ready?

229
00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:07.675
-One. two. three.
-Horsey.

232
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.807
-[Franny] Pony!
-[George] Gosh.

233
00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:18.143
-You coming?
-Yeah. in a second. I have to do dishes.

234
00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:20.479
Oh. can you get that pot for me. please?

235
00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:23.315
-Thank you. I'll be up soon.
-Okay.

236
00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:25.317
Don't be long. I'm pretty tired.

237
00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:35.661
[uneasy music playing]

"Damned."

240
00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:34.094
George.

241
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:35.971
Hey. George.

242
00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:36.889
George.

243
00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:38.766
[George moans]

244
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.726
I'm a-- I'm asleep.

-[woman 1] Where?
-[woman 2] Eight.

254
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:29.626
-[woman 1] Three pounds is a lot.
-You've got to be telling--

255
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:30.752
Company.

256
00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:33.172
Hi. Are you the Historical Society?

257
00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:35.132
Indeed we are.

258
00:19:35.215 --> 00:19:38.010
Um. I don't know if you need volunteers.

259
00:19:38.093 --> 00:19:40.721
but I'm new in town.
and I would love to meet people

260
00:19:40.804 --> 00:19:43.390
and possibly learn more about the area.

261
00:19:43.473 --> 00:19:45.350
Write your information down.

262
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.603
Okay.

263
00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:49.771
[blind woman] We'll send you a schedule.

264
00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.482
And also. I was curious

265
00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:56.737
if you had any information
on some of the older homes in the area.

266
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.740
being that I just bought one.

267
00:20:01.074 --> 00:20:01.950
Oh.

268
00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:06.997
Actually. there's a picture
of your house hanging up.

269
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.582
-Really? Where?
-Yeah.

270
00:20:08.665 --> 00:20:12.169
In the other room.
The couple who built it is in it. too.

271
00:20:12.252 --> 00:20:14.087
The original ones.

272
00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:16.298
long before the Vayle family.

273
00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:18.884
I… I'm going to go take a look. Thanks.

274
00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:25.724

276
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.129
-[Franny] He doesn't look like a cat.
-[George] He does.

277
00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:59.716
-[Franny] His ears are so little.
-[George] It's called Cat in the Hat.

278
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.053
-And his nose and stuff like that.
-He's got a normal nose.

279
00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:05.305
[Franny giggles] But it's so little!

280
00:21:15.899 --> 00:21:17.067
You know he killed someone?

281
00:21:19.194 --> 00:21:20.779
Over a game of tennis.

282
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.614
Who?

283
00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:24.032
Caravaggio.

284
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.411
Oh. well. I'm not surprised.

285
00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:30.247
People get away
with all kinds of horrible things.

286
00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:34.668
Are you speaking from personal experience?

287
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:35.794
[chuckles]

288
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.965
So are you studying art?
I-I teach over at Saginaw.

289
00:21:40.048 --> 00:21:41.341
Oh God. No.

290
00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:42.718
No. I was just…

291
00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:45.387
looking for T-shirt ideas.

292
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.347
I'm all about literature in school.

293
00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:48.390
Which school?

294
00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:50.100
Cornell.

295
00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:52.769
Oh. that's quite a commute.

296
00:21:53.353 --> 00:21:54.813
Just taking a little hiatus.

297
00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.441
Riding for rich folk at Crow Hill Stables.

298
00:21:58.108 --> 00:21:59.318
Yeah. I know that place.

299
00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:02.487
It's right next to the tennis club.
I play there sometimes.

300
00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:04.448
Oh. Well. uh…

301
00:22:04.531 --> 00:22:06.783
I hope you're a better loser
than Caravaggio.

302
00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:10.704
George Claire.

303
00:22:11.788 --> 00:22:12.998
Right.

304
00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:15.083
Right. Claire.

305
00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.961
Yeah. my friend Eddie does your yard work.

306
00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:20.672
I think your wife hired him.

307
00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:27.721
Is that your little girl?

308
00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:29.931
Yeah. that's Franny.

309
00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:31.266
Oh…

310
00:22:34.561 --> 00:22:35.771
Hi there. Franny.

311
00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:37.314
How's that book?

312
00:22:38.315 --> 00:22:39.524
What does this say?

313
00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:41.568
Let's see.

314
00:22:42.402 --> 00:22:44.488
Okay. it says…

315
00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:49.284
"He should not be here.
He should not be about."

316
00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:52.788
"He should not be here
when your mother is out."

317
00:22:57.584 --> 00:22:59.086
It's nice to meet you. Franny.

318
00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:00.128
[Franny] Mm-hmm.

319
00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:06.885
[George] Okay. ready to go?

320
00:23:08.678 --> 00:23:09.596
George?

321
00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:13.767
George?

322
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.477
[music playing on TV]

323
00:23:18.438 --> 00:23:20.982
George. you're not going to believe
the picture I just saw.

324
00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:23.068
[water running]

325
00:23:27.447 --> 00:23:28.824

[Cole and Franny chatting indistinctly]

328
00:23:52.806 --> 00:23:55.100
-[Eddie] Wanna go to the pond?
-[Franny] Yeah!

329
00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:57.310
[Eddie] You wanna go swim?

330
00:23:58.103 --> 00:24:00.856
-[Cole] Come on. Franny. Gonna catch you!
-[Franny] No!

331
00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:03.191
-[Cole] I'm gonna throw you in!
-[Franny] No!

332
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:08.238
[Eddie] Hey Franny. watch out
for the snapping turtles. okay?

333
00:24:08.321 --> 00:24:10.740
All right? It's down my butt!
It's got my butt!

334
00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:14.536
-[Franny laughs]
-Didn't they say summer's officially over?

335
00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.872
Our seasons play
by their own rules up here.

336
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:19.791
Who knows? It could snow tomorrow.

337
00:24:21.334 --> 00:24:24.129
Well. I brought some lemonade
to help you guys cool off.

338
00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:26.465
but it looks like you're way ahead of me.

339
00:24:26.548 --> 00:24:29.342
You should come on in. The water's great.

340
00:24:29.926 --> 00:24:30.886
Believe me.

341
00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:33.680
it looks very tempting.

342
00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:35.891
You know what they say about temptation.

343
00:24:37.058 --> 00:24:39.227
Easiest way to kill it's just to give in.

344
00:24:42.105 --> 00:24:44.107
[Catherine] So what does your uncle do?

345
00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:46.568
He's a hearse driver.

346
00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:49.237
I guess every town needs one of those.

347
00:24:51.114 --> 00:24:52.574
Can I ask about your parents?

348
00:24:54.618 --> 00:24:57.370
Um… both dead. Car accident.

349
00:24:58.788 --> 00:25:00.457
Oh God. I'm so sorry.

350
00:25:02.626 --> 00:25:05.712
Yeah. I mean. it was something.

351
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.089
It makes a kid grow up fast.

352
00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:12.969
Cole's on good track for college. though.

353
00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:14.930
And what about you?

354
00:25:15.555 --> 00:25:17.682
Nah. that stuff's not really in my cards.

355
00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:20.894
I mean. I did want to study music…

356
00:25:20.977 --> 00:25:23.188
-Really? What instruments do you play?
-…but…

357
00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:26.233
All kinds.
I-- I have a beat-up guitar right now.

358
00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:28.777
We have a piano at the house.
I just got it tuned.

359
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.239
It'd be nice to have someone
who can actually play it. I'm pathetic.

360
00:25:32.322 --> 00:25:36.034
[chuckles] All right.
Well. thanks. Mrs. Claire.

361
00:25:36.117 --> 00:25:38.495
-Catherine. Sorry.
-It's okay.

362
00:25:39.746 --> 00:25:41.164
You'll get used to it.

363
00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:44.668
-[students laughing]
-Yeah. Please do not tell him I said that.

364
00:25:46.002 --> 00:25:47.254
All right.

365
00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:50.924
Okay. so.
the Hudson River School painters.

366
00:25:51.508 --> 00:25:54.177
Landscapes as the realm of the soul.

367
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:58.473
If you keep reading around the subject.
you'll find it really rewarding. Really.

368
00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.475
-Keep going. okay?
-Thank you so much.

369
00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:01.768
-We will.
-Bye!

370
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:03.103
George Claire?

371
00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:05.272
Yes. Hello. Can I help you?

372
00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:08.567
Justine Sokolov.
Adjunct weaving instructor.

373
00:26:09.317 --> 00:26:11.778
You play tennis with my husband Bram.

374
00:26:11.861 --> 00:26:12.988
Bram?

375
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:16.783
Oh. Bram. of course. Yes.
He mentioned that his wife teaches here.

376
00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:22.247
I hear you've developed a cult-like
following already in our department.

377
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.790
So I… Oh. this you?

378
00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:26.585
I thought I'd invite you
and your wife over

379
00:26:26.668 --> 00:26:28.628
and see what all the fuss is about.

380
00:26:29.337 --> 00:26:30.422
Oh. uh…

381
00:26:32.632 --> 00:26:34.634
That sounds really nice. [chuckles]

382
00:26:34.718 --> 00:26:39.014
You know. it'd be nice for my wife to meet
a few more Saginaw folk. too. so yeah.

383
00:26:39.723 --> 00:26:42.601
Excellent.
I have your number in the registry.

384
00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:44.436
so I'll give the missus a call.

385
00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:46.605
-Fantastic.
-George Claire.

386
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:49.065
Wow. You painted these?

387
00:26:50.066 --> 00:26:51.860
Yeah. a long time ago.

388
00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:54.654
I gave up the whole fine arts thing
to focus on theory.

389
00:26:54.738 --> 00:26:56.615
Realized I wasn't really up to snuff.

390
00:26:56.698 --> 00:26:57.991
[chuckles]

391
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.118
I disagree.

392
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.580
These are confidently executed.
and they are…

393
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.998
quite unique.

394
00:27:06.249 --> 00:27:07.208
Thank you.

395
00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:10.587
Uh. you should see my wife's stuff.
She's the real artist of the family.

396
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.047
Okay. I look forward to it.

397
00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:14.591
I'll be in touch. George Claire.

398
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.219
[bugs chirping]

399
00:27:20.263 --> 00:27:21.264
[sighs]

400
00:27:24.017 --> 00:27:25.602
[groans] What's wrong?

401
00:27:25.685 --> 00:27:28.188
That smell. It's-- it's getting stronger.

402
00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:31.691
Yeah. I figured it out.
It's 'cause we're above the garage.

403
00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:34.944
I'll get some fans
and air it out in the morning.

404
00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:36.613
[exhales]

405
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.032
But why does it come and go?

406
00:27:39.115 --> 00:27:41.284
Cath. please stop with the ghost stuff.

407
00:27:42.577 --> 00:27:45.914
I'm not gonna let you
put a negative spin on this house.

421
00:29:04.534 --> 00:29:05.994
Mommy. I'm scared. I'm scared!

422
00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:07.871
-Mommy!
-Hey. hey! Shh.

423
00:29:07.954 --> 00:29:10.415
-What happened?
-What is going on? Where were you?

424
00:29:10.498 --> 00:29:13.668
-What happened? Tell me.
-I saw the lady. Mommy. I'm scared.

425
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:15.920
It's okay. it's okay. Don't worry.

426
00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:19.632
-Mommy's here. You can sleep with us.
-Oh God. Cath. again?

427
00:29:20.884 --> 00:29:24.137
If we filled out her sedative prescription
like the pediatrician said.

428
00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.680
this wouldn't keep happening.

429
00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:29.768
I said to you ten times I don't feel good
giving her unnecessary medications.

430
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.561
It's this house.

431
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.315
Oh God. You two sleep in there.
I'll take Franny's room.

432
00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:39.027
Hey. Hey.

433
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.820
Daddy's mad at me.

434
00:29:40.904 --> 00:29:42.572
[gasps] No! No. no. no. he's not.

436
00:29:43.573 --> 00:29:45.658

438
00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:50.830
[Eddie] It's gotta feel good.

439
00:29:51.998 --> 00:29:53.374
I guess. yeah.

440
00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:55.084
[laughs]

441
00:29:58.129 --> 00:30:00.632
Uh. guess who I ran into the other day?

442
00:30:00.715 --> 00:30:01.966
Who?

443
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.928
Your boss. George Claire.

444
00:30:05.011 --> 00:30:06.679
-Oh. yeah?
-Yeah.

445
00:30:08.014 --> 00:30:09.891
I haven't met the guy officially yet.

446
00:30:11.267 --> 00:30:12.185
What's he like?

447
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:15.188
Dishonest.

448
00:30:15.271 --> 00:30:16.606
Deceitful.

449
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.983
[chuckles] How would you know that?

450
00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:22.904
Because I found him attractive.

451
00:30:31.204 --> 00:30:32.705
[deep sighing]

452
00:30:36.584 --> 00:30:37.919
[Cole] Here we go!

453
00:30:38.878 --> 00:30:40.672
Whee!

454
00:30:40.755 --> 00:30:42.841
You wanna watch Eddie chop wood?

455
00:30:42.924 --> 00:30:44.050
[Franny] Yeah!

456
00:30:44.133 --> 00:30:46.886

[Eddie grunts]

458
00:30:50.723 --> 00:30:51.933
Chop.

459
00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:54.561
Chop.

460
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:56.604
[ax thuds]

461
00:30:57.397 --> 00:30:58.314

[chuckling] I… I don't really know.

He's got a social life at that school.
and I'm isolated.

[woman] Something's wrong.
I can hear it in your voice.

I'm starting… to see things.

-Catherine. have you been eating?
-[sighs]

485

What's the church like up there?
Have you prayed on any of this?

486
00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:02.123
Try to remember
how he did right by marrying--

487
00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:06.002
Oh. I gotta go. Thanks a lot
for the pep talk. Mom. I love you.

488
00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:08.963
[Catherine] That was some run.

489
00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:14.010
Yeah. I guess I went pretty far.
I don't know what came over me.

490
00:34:15.011 --> 00:34:17.764
And then I-I got distracted
by these wildflowers.

491

Thanks. but now
you're going to be late for class.

Hey.

498
00:35:18.407 --> 00:35:20.243
-[Cole] What are you doing?
-One sec.

499
00:35:21.202 --> 00:35:22.703
Mr. Claire. right?

500
00:35:23.538 --> 00:35:25.748
It's nice to finally meet you. I'm Eddie.

-The Vayle boys. aren't you?

502
00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.171
Not anymore. sir.

503
00:35:32.255 --> 00:35:35.049
We go by Lucks now.
Took our uncle's last name.

504
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.553
Do me a favor. My… my wife
doesn't know that you lived here.

505
00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:40.555
Uh. or what happened.

506
00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:42.932
I think it would be better
if we kept it that way.

507
00:35:43.724 --> 00:35:45.852
Uh. she's a nervous woman and. uh…

508
00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:49.230
well. she wouldn't want you around
if she found out.

509
00:35:50.106 --> 00:35:51.816
[chuckles softly]

510
00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:53.151
Sure. Mr. Claire.

511
00:35:55.194 --> 00:35:57.363
My brother and I are only here
for honest work.

512
00:35:57.446 --> 00:35:58.823
Thank you. I appreciate it.

513
00:36:02.118 --> 00:36:03.119
It seems a…

514
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:04.745
little odd. no?

515
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.665
That you'd want to be here at all.

516
00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:10.960
Taking care of this house
comes second nature to us.

517
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.588
Right.

518
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:17.466
Did you meet your husband in art school?

519
00:36:18.384 --> 00:36:20.219
Yeah. we were undergrads together.

520
00:36:21.554 --> 00:36:22.722
That's cool.

521
00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:29.020
[Catherine] Were your parents
supportive of you studying music?

522
00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:31.814
Yeah. my mom was the one who taught me.

523
00:36:32.565 --> 00:36:36.652
But when my father found my application.
he. uh… he beat me with a two-by-four.

524
00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:40.072
Are you serious?

525
00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:41.032
Yeah.

526
00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:44.452
Yeah. he actually
bloodied me up pretty good.

527
00:36:48.497 --> 00:36:51.125
Well. if you decide
to reapply to music school.

528
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:54.086
I will personally write you
a check for your application.

529
00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:58.382
Wow.

530
00:37:00.676 --> 00:37:01.761
You really got me.

531
00:37:02.678 --> 00:37:05.973
["Someday You'll Be Sorry"
by Louis Armstrong playing on piano]

532
00:37:22.698 --> 00:37:24.158
-Hey. George.
-[music stops]

533
00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:28.496
Eddie-- Eddie was just playing
his favorite Louis Armstrong song for me.

534
00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:31.290
-Called-- What's it called?
-"Someday You'll Be Sorry."

535
00:37:31.374 --> 00:37:34.293
[chuckling] That's right.
That's the story of my life.

536
00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.170
[chuckles]

537
00:37:36.837 --> 00:37:38.256
What a surprise.

538
00:37:39.131 --> 00:37:41.676
Eddie was telling me earlier
how he was here for honest work.

539
00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:44.262
I-- I didn't realize that it included

540
00:37:44.845 --> 00:37:45.805
entertainment.

541
00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:48.474
We finished painting. sir.

542
00:37:48.557 --> 00:37:52.061
and. uh. Mrs. Claire asked me
to play something before I left.

543
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.730
-So--
-Wait. Eddie. Eddie.

544
00:37:54.814 --> 00:37:58.317
Come on. please. Don't stop on my account.

545
00:37:58.401 --> 00:38:01.487
I've been called many things before.
but never a party pooper.

546
00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:06.701
Well. the man of the house has spoken.

547
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.912
so finish the goddamn song. Eddie.

548
00:38:11.372 --> 00:38:12.748
Yeah. please.

549
00:38:17.503 --> 00:38:19.046

[piano music fades to silence]

552
00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:50.494
Shit.

553
00:38:52.955 --> 00:38:53.914
[sighs]

554
00:38:56.751 --> 00:38:58.878
[uneasy music playing]

555
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:25.780
Oh God.

556
00:39:30.618 --> 00:39:32.203
[grunting]

557
00:39:32.286 --> 00:39:33.329

558
00:39:39.668 --> 00:39:41.921
-[ghostly voice] Catherine.
-[gasps. gags]

559
00:39:46.592 --> 00:39:48.427

00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:20.167
[Catherine groans]

566
00:40:30.302 --> 00:40:32.054
[raven screeches]

567
00:40:37.143 --> 00:40:39.812
[George and girl panting]

568
00:40:40.396 --> 00:40:42.523
[George]
What you do to me. you do not know.

569
00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:45.401
My God.

570
00:40:46.902 --> 00:40:49.488
I've never done
anything like this before. you know.

571
00:40:50.364 --> 00:40:51.449
[exhales loudly]

572
00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:58.664
What's wrong?

573
00:41:01.917 --> 00:41:03.461
What? I'm just talking.

574
00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:07.256
-Sharing.
-What the fuck is wrong with me?

575
00:41:07.339 --> 00:41:10.509
-Why do I keep doing this?
-Hey. Willis. I'm being serious.

576
00:41:10.593 --> 00:41:12.678
It'd be nice to know you a bit better.

577
00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:15.598
Some ordinary. regular things.

578
00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:17.475
That's not what this is about.

579
00:41:18.184 --> 00:41:19.685
Ow! What the hell?

580
00:41:19.768 --> 00:41:22.563
You think because I fuck you.
I'm fooled by you?

581
00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:24.857
I've been around guys like you
my whole life.

582
00:41:25.566 --> 00:41:29.111
-What the hell are you talking about?
-My dad made a fortune defending them.

583
00:41:29.195 --> 00:41:31.989
Thieves. con men. psychopaths.

584
00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:36.368
And they all got off because
that's the way the world works for men.

585
00:41:36.452 --> 00:41:39.705
Okay. look. I see that you have
some pretty awful ideas about men.

586
00:41:39.788 --> 00:41:42.041
I have awful ideas about everything.

587
00:41:42.124 --> 00:41:43.667
Now get the fuck up.

588
00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:45.878
-Come on. Willis.
-No.

589
00:41:47.421 --> 00:41:49.089
I'm done with this.

590
00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:50.216
Willis!

591
00:41:50.299 --> 00:41:51.425
Willis!

592
00:41:55.095 --> 00:41:56.680
[horse neighs]

593
00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:00.976
Willis!

[ethereal music playing]

595
00:42:19.078 --> 00:42:20.746
-[Justine] Hi!
-Trick or treat?

596
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:21.705
[all chuckle]

597
00:42:21.789 --> 00:42:23.791
-Come in. come in.
-Hello. I'm Catherine.

598
00:42:23.874 --> 00:42:26.335
-Oh. of course you are. Mmm.
-Oh.

599
00:42:26.919 --> 00:42:28.087
[chuckles] George. hi.

600
00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:29.922
-Hi. For you.
-Oh. thank you.

601
00:42:30.005 --> 00:42:32.341
Bram. where are you?
The Claires have arrived.

602
00:42:32.424 --> 00:42:33.676
-Wow.
-[Bram] I'm here.

603
00:42:33.759 --> 00:42:34.760
[George] Amazing.

604
00:42:34.843 --> 00:42:36.095
-[Justine] Thanks.
-Hello.

605
00:42:36.178 --> 00:42:37.555
-I'm Catherine.
-Hey. Bram.

606
00:42:37.638 --> 00:42:39.848
-Thanks for having us.
-Look what they brought us.

607
00:42:39.932 --> 00:42:41.684
-Thank you. How are you?
-Very well.

608
00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:43.018
-Come on in.
-Beautiful.

609
00:42:43.102 --> 00:42:44.728
-Thank you.
-I love your artwork.

610
00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:48.315
Ah. Well. yes. We're just enjoying
our tenure here while it lasts.

611
00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:50.067
-Oh. do you rent?
-No. no. no.

612
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:53.279
[laughing] He just means
how these old Hudson Valley homes are.

613
00:42:53.362 --> 00:42:55.573
We think we own them.
we're just caretakers.

614
00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:57.324
[laughing] They outlive us all.

615
00:42:57.908 --> 00:43:00.160
My wife thinks ours is haunted.

616
00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:02.121
-Well. she's probably right.
-[laughs]

617
00:43:02.204 --> 00:43:03.581
They're all haunted a bit.

618
00:43:03.664 --> 00:43:06.125
After all.
we're in Headless Horseman country.

619
00:43:06.208 --> 00:43:07.835
[laughs] Let me take your coats.

620
00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:11.755
Oh. actually. we should go outside
and look at the alpacas before they nap.

621
00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:13.841
-Oh. yes.
-This way.

622
00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:15.884
-You'll love it.
-Alpacas nap?

623
00:43:17.052 --> 00:43:19.346
[George] Tell me. Bram. [blows]

624
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.724
Where does one buy
such quality weed up here?

625
00:43:21.807 --> 00:43:24.101
-[Bram] Buy? I grow it.
-[George] Nice.

626
00:43:24.768 --> 00:43:28.480
You know. I came up here
to write the Great American Novel. but…

627
00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:32.693
I spend most of my time
tending to my garden. if you get my drift.

628
00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:33.611
Mm-hmm.

629
00:43:33.694 --> 00:43:35.613
I love your setup. It's amazing.

630
00:43:35.696 --> 00:43:38.157
-Aww. thank you.
-And your work is so unique.

631
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.993
Thanks. It's gonna sound a little strange.

632
00:43:41.076 --> 00:43:44.580
but it's a spiritual thing for me.
weaving.

633
00:43:44.663 --> 00:43:48.542
I tap into something cosmic
when I'm working.

634
00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:50.336
-Its patterns. you know?
-Yeah.

635
00:43:51.086 --> 00:43:52.880
Sometimes I feel guilty
taking credit for it.

636
00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:54.757
Why? You shouldn't.

637
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.468
I would love for you
to make something for my Franny.

638
00:43:57.551 --> 00:44:00.638
-I'd pay you. naturally.
-Don't be silly. I'll do it for cost.

639
00:44:01.263 --> 00:44:04.516
Oh. actually. George already asked
for a scarf for his mother.

640
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.477
so I'll just add it to that order.

641
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.686
Okay.

642
00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:08.604
Wow.

643
00:44:10.189 --> 00:44:12.941
-You guys just have the one child?
-Yeah. Yes.

644
00:44:13.025 --> 00:44:16.445
She's four. And you and Bram?
Do you guys have kids?

645
00:44:17.446 --> 00:44:18.280
No.

646
00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:20.282
No.

647
00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:25.204
Bram and I were conflicted
about that for a while.

648
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.874
and then Mother Nature
made the final decision.

649
00:44:28.957 --> 00:44:30.626
And she made the right one.

650
00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:33.128
It all worked out perfectly.

651
00:44:35.005 --> 00:44:38.008
I was conflicted. too.
but just like that. it…

652
00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:40.177
It happened.

653
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.681
And then we got married.
which I was also conflicted about.

654
00:44:44.932 --> 00:44:48.143
I guess you could say
I'm a conflicted Catholic girl at heart.

655
00:44:48.227 --> 00:44:50.771
dutifully going through the motions.

656
00:44:51.605 --> 00:44:52.940
You know.

657
00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:55.150
the first few years of our marriage

658
00:44:55.984 --> 00:44:59.988
were a complete blur
because of the baby and school.

659
00:45:00.072 --> 00:45:03.951
We're really still trying
to catch our breath up here.

660
00:45:07.996 --> 00:45:10.916
You know. I attend this women's group.

661
00:45:10.999 --> 00:45:13.085
It's an Arts Club… thing.

662
00:45:13.168 --> 00:45:15.129
We meet once a month up in Albany.

663
00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:19.425
and there are so many
creative ladies to meet. Catherine.

664
00:45:20.008 --> 00:45:21.885
I think you should come with me.

665
00:45:22.511 --> 00:45:24.763
I would love something like that.

666
00:45:24.847 --> 00:45:26.306
I don't know anybody up here.

667
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.016
Well. you do now.

668
00:45:32.271 --> 00:45:35.023
It must be so nice

669
00:45:35.107 --> 00:45:37.317
to inherit a fortune

670
00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:40.529
and then spend all day not writing a book.

671
00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:45.409
I really like them. especially her.
She's so interesting.

672
00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:50.581
She's so free with herself and her body.

673
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.001
She can certainly put away some lasagna.

674
00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:57.963
-That's a nasty thing to say.
-Come on. I'm kidding.

675
00:45:58.046 --> 00:45:59.381
I like them. too.

676
00:46:00.382 --> 00:46:03.343
I especially like…

677
00:46:04.511 --> 00:46:06.555
[sniffs] …Bram's weed.

678
00:46:06.638 --> 00:46:08.098
[sniffs] Mmm.

679
00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:10.934
Are you sure you're okay to drive
after smoking so much?

680
00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:11.935
Yeah.

681
00:46:12.686 --> 00:46:14.980
-I'm fine. I'm more than okay.
-Really?

682
00:46:17.232 --> 00:46:19.401
-Watch this.
-[engine accelerating]

683
00:46:19.485 --> 00:46:21.236
George. slow down.

684
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.821
-Slow down. George.
-Really?

685
00:46:22.905 --> 00:46:24.448
-Really?
-George. slow down!

686
00:46:24.531 --> 00:46:25.824
[yelling] Slow down!

687
00:46:26.408 --> 00:46:28.494
-[Catherine] Stop. George!
-[George] Whoo!

688
00:46:28.577 --> 00:46:30.120
[tires screeching]

689
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:32.581
God. what the hell are you doing?

690
00:46:32.664 --> 00:46:35.375
What? What. I'm just having a little fun.

691
00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:37.920
You remember what that was like.
Cath. huh?

692
00:46:38.003 --> 00:46:40.506
-That's not funny!
-[laughing] Come on.

693
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.759
Oh. come on. Cath. Cath!

694
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:48.180
Catherine!

695
00:46:48.263 --> 00:46:51.225
Cath. where are you going?
Come on. get back in the car.

696
00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.101
-Cath!
-Get your hands off me!

697
00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:55.270
God. we are two smart people.

698
00:46:55.354 --> 00:46:57.439
-We should've known better.
-Known what?

699
00:46:57.523 --> 00:47:01.026
That I'm only here
for the imaginary book jacket bio

700
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:03.070
that you have in your fucking head.

701
00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:06.990
The-- the-- the professor
with the wife and the country home.

702
00:47:07.074 --> 00:47:08.742
I gave up everything for you!

703
00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:10.369
Oh God. I'm so sorry.

704
00:47:10.452 --> 00:47:12.746
I'm so sorry
I fucked up both of our lives!

705
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.916
And the worst part is this is all I have.

706
00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:18.836
Cath. you know what you do have?
Is the crying drunks.

707
00:47:18.919 --> 00:47:21.797
You are a person
who should not drink alcohol.

708
00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.383
especially when you do not
fucking eat anything!

709
00:47:24.466 --> 00:47:28.011
Oh my God. I am so sick
of everybody blaming everything

710
00:47:28.095 --> 00:47:30.806
in my fucking life on me not eating!

711
00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:33.225
Please. get back in the goddamn car!

712
00:47:33.308 --> 00:47:35.102
-Get off of me!
-[cries out] Ow!

713
00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:36.395
Fuck!

714
00:47:36.478 --> 00:47:38.438
-[groans]
-Oh my God. Cath?

715
00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:40.107
[Catherine whimpering]

716
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.483
Oh my God. Cath…

717
00:47:41.567 --> 00:47:43.735
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Was that…

718
00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:44.903
Did I… Did I…

719
00:47:53.078 --> 00:47:53.996
Cath?

720
00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:57.833
Cath. are you okay?

721
00:47:57.916 --> 00:47:59.126
[car door opens]

722
00:48:00.294 --> 00:48:01.128
[car door slams]

723
00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:03.463
[door opens]

724
00:48:09.595 --> 00:48:10.429
[door closes]

725
00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:15.726
Come on. Cole. Get up.
I'll drive you home.

726
00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:22.190
[door closes]

727
00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:25.527
[footsteps]

728
00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:41.627
[George] Hey. Cath?

729
00:48:44.338 --> 00:48:45.672
I didn't mean to hurt you.

730
00:48:46.673 --> 00:48:47.591
[sighs]

731
00:48:50.719 --> 00:48:52.554
I would never hurt you.

732
00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:57.559
But I also…

733
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:02.230
I have not been sensitive
to your needs for some time.

734
00:49:03.982 --> 00:49:06.109
And for that. I owe you an apology.

735
00:49:07.486 --> 00:49:08.862
More than an apology.

736
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.530
[electricity buzzing]

737
00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:12.574
One thing I do know…

738
00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:16.119
[voice breaks] …is I love you.

739
00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:17.704
-[buzzing]
-[Franny screams]

740
00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:19.873
-[glass shatters]
-[Franny] What was that?

741
00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:21.333
Oh God. Jesus. What?

742
00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:23.961
[Catherine] It's okay. baby.

743
00:49:24.044 --> 00:49:27.047
[whispering]
Nothing happened. It's okay. It's okay.

744
00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:33.804
[ethereal music playing]

745
00:49:41.728 --> 00:49:45.816
[woman] "We look at each other.
and we are not ashamed."

746
00:49:45.899 --> 00:49:50.320
"I wearing the face
of the proper marriage.

747
00:49:50.404 --> 00:49:54.032
you the face of the independent woman."

748
00:49:55.075 --> 00:49:58.412
"We cleaved to each other
across that space."

749
00:50:05.085 --> 00:50:07.754
[door opens and closes]

750
00:50:12.926 --> 00:50:14.636
[George] You're back later than I thought.

751
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.595
Am I?

752
00:50:16.805 --> 00:50:18.015
The fridge is empty.

753
00:50:18.932 --> 00:50:21.727
I can go out. pick up some food for us.

754
00:50:22.894 --> 00:50:26.440
-What do you feel like?
-I. uh… I ate with Justine.

755
00:50:37.492 --> 00:50:38.910
-[keys jangle]
-[door closes]

756
00:50:38.994 --> 00:50:41.496
[car engine idling]

757
00:50:57.262 --> 00:51:00.015
[George] Brilliant setting
for a faculty meeting. Floyd.

758
00:51:00.098 --> 00:51:04.186
[Floyd] Yes. I take her out alone a lot.
which would seem selfish.

759
00:51:04.269 --> 00:51:05.520
[George chuckles]

760
00:51:05.604 --> 00:51:08.982
I used to sail a bit myself.
Grew up on the Connecticut coast.

761
00:51:09.066 --> 00:51:11.777
Oh. that's right.
Do your family own a boat?

762
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.238
I inherited my cousin's. The Lost Horizon.

763
00:51:15.322 --> 00:51:16.156
[Floyd] Ah.

764
00:51:17.449 --> 00:51:19.701
He actually drowned while sailing it.

765
00:51:19.785 --> 00:51:21.286
Oh. how sad.

766
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:23.205
Yeah.

767
00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:24.664
Only 19.

768
00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:27.084
-Mm.
-Already so sophisticated.

769
00:51:27.167 --> 00:51:28.126
[Floyd sighs]

770
00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:29.795
I remember when he died.

771
00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:35.175
I stole his diary after the funeral.
Read it repeatedly.

772
00:51:37.052 --> 00:51:39.221
I know it's-- it's an awful thing to do.

773
00:51:39.304 --> 00:51:42.474
but I… I think I needed some sort of…

774
00:51:42.557 --> 00:51:43.642
connection.

775
00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:46.853
Did you learn anything from it?

776
00:51:48.146 --> 00:51:49.439
Yeah. a little.

777
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:52.484
He was gay. unhappy.

778
00:51:53.193 --> 00:51:54.903
Typical tortured artist.

779
00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.405
And then all that angst

780
00:51:58.073 --> 00:52:00.826
one unfortunate moment vanishes forever.

781
00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:05.914
We're all so inconsequential. Floyd.

782
00:52:07.833 --> 00:52:10.502
Swedenborg would suggest otherwise.

783
00:52:11.336 --> 00:52:13.922
He'd say death is only the beginning.

784
00:52:15.841 --> 00:52:17.259
Have you read the book yet?

785
00:52:17.342 --> 00:52:18.718
[chuckles]

786
00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:21.012
[George] It's on the top of my list.

787
00:52:26.685 --> 00:52:27.519
[door opens]

788
00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:29.229
-[George] Come. come in.
-Ahh.

789
00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:30.564
Cath?

790
00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:31.982
Let me get that.

791
00:52:33.733 --> 00:52:34.776
Hello.

792
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.988
Oh. Catherine. this is Floyd DeBeers.
head of our department.

793
00:52:38.071 --> 00:52:40.323
He also took me
on this magnificent boat ride.

794
00:52:40.407 --> 00:52:41.741
So good to meet you.

795
00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:45.412
So. in return. I invited him to our house.
a very unfair trade.

796
00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:48.331
-I've heard wonderful things about you.
-As I have you.

797
00:52:48.415 --> 00:52:49.499
[Catherine chuckles]

798
00:52:49.583 --> 00:52:52.294
George. is this some kind of setup?

799
00:52:52.377 --> 00:52:54.504
[Catherine chuckles] What?

800
00:52:55.547 --> 00:52:59.176
[chuckling] I-- I swear to God.
I didn't even tell her you were coming.

801
00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:02.179
You see. George? You see?
There are no coincidences.

802
00:53:02.262 --> 00:53:05.849
I'm sorry. I-- I was taken by the artwork
and just started reading it.

803
00:53:05.932 --> 00:53:07.601
[George] Nothing to be sorry for.

804
00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:10.645
You do know what this is. don't you?
The cover art?

805
00:53:11.897 --> 00:53:15.233
It's a soul
transitioning into the afterlife.

806
00:53:15.317 --> 00:53:16.484
[Catherine] Really?

807
00:53:16.568 --> 00:53:18.570
[Floyd] The painter followed Swedenborg.

808
00:53:18.653 --> 00:53:22.449
so he believed that death
is parallel to birth. but divine.

809
00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:24.659
[George] Floyd. believe me.

810
00:53:24.743 --> 00:53:29.247
You do not want to get
my wife started on all that. uh. stuff.

811
00:53:29.331 --> 00:53:33.168
[chuckles awkwardly]
Uh. Cath. please show Floyd around.

812
00:53:33.251 --> 00:53:35.253
Um. I'm gonna fix us some cocktails.

813
00:53:36.254 --> 00:53:38.006
May I show you around?

814
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:39.257
-I can't wait.
-Great.

815
00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:40.175
[both chuckle]

816
00:53:41.509 --> 00:53:43.470
My daughter's asleep already.

817
00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:45.764
but you can-- we can peek in her room.

818
00:53:45.847 --> 00:53:48.808
We actually have four bedrooms.
but we only use two of them.

819
00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:51.269
A young couple can't have too many bed--

820
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.190
You okay?

821
00:53:55.273 --> 00:53:56.858
Shh.

822
00:53:59.027 --> 00:54:00.654
[whispering] We're not alone. are we?

823
00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:04.115
What do you mean?

824
00:54:05.951 --> 00:54:07.827
She doesn't mean any harm.

825
00:54:08.703 --> 00:54:10.664
She has reasons for lingering.

826
00:54:14.376 --> 00:54:17.379
[whispering]
I've seen her. and so has my daughter.

827
00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:20.465
Because she's here for you.

828
00:54:21.174 --> 00:54:23.009
-She wants you to know that.
-[cries]

829
00:54:23.718 --> 00:54:26.513
At first. I was terrified.

830
00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:28.223
of course. but now…

831
00:54:30.225 --> 00:54:33.561
every time I sense her. I-- I feel…

832
00:54:35.563 --> 00:54:36.648
comfort.

833
00:54:36.731 --> 00:54:40.610
-I know that doesn't make any sense.
-It makes perfect sense.

834
00:54:40.694 --> 00:54:41.987
[crying]

835
00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:44.489
[Floyd shushes gently]

836
00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:47.492
Her name is Smit. wife of Jacob Smit.

837
00:54:47.575 --> 00:54:50.578
He was a… um. a local minister.

838
00:54:50.662 --> 00:54:54.291
They built this house.
and that's all I can find at the library.

839
00:54:54.374 --> 00:54:56.584
Let me do some digging on campus.

840
00:54:56.668 --> 00:54:58.837
You can't tell George
because he can't know.

841
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.171
He thinks that I'm crazy.

842
00:55:00.255 --> 00:55:02.007
No. of course not.

843
00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:03.967
He's just afraid. you know.

844
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.428
Men at his stage of life often are.

845
00:55:06.511 --> 00:55:09.347
But try and be patient. Catherine.

846
00:55:09.431 --> 00:55:12.392
With love.
he can catch up to you spiritually.

847
00:55:13.435 --> 00:55:15.186
And let us…

848
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:17.897
Let us hold a séance here.

849
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:21.067
-With or without George.
-Really?

850
00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:24.112
We can find out
a little more about your housemate.

851
00:55:24.863 --> 00:55:26.323
[George] Bye. Floyd.

852
00:55:26.406 --> 00:55:29.743
Good night. good night.
and thanks for a wonderful evening.

853
00:55:30.243 --> 00:55:31.453
[George] Drive safe.

854
00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:38.209
My God. Cath. he absolutely adored you.

855
00:55:38.293 --> 00:55:41.963
I-- I have never seen Floyd
light up like that around anyone.

856
00:55:43.882 --> 00:55:47.010
And you were up there awhile.
Did he say anything?

857
00:55:48.762 --> 00:55:49.596
About what?

858
00:55:49.679 --> 00:55:51.389
About me?

859
00:55:52.098 --> 00:55:53.183
Oh.

860
00:55:55.101 --> 00:55:57.937
He said that you were
an exceptional professor.

861
00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:00.023
[sighs]

862
00:56:00.106 --> 00:56:03.401
And you are an exceptional wife.

863
00:56:03.485 --> 00:56:05.528
which means the world to me.

864
00:56:05.612 --> 00:56:06.446
[kisses]

865
00:56:09.115 --> 00:56:12.327
Ah! I feel like having company
was good for us.

866
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:13.995
Yeah? We need this.

867
00:56:15.997 --> 00:56:19.000
I. uh…
I want to invite my whole department over.

868
00:56:19.084 --> 00:56:20.960
A-- a real party. What do you think?

869
00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.505
[sighs]

870
00:56:23.588 --> 00:56:27.801
I think we owe it to Franny
to make this place a happy home.

871
00:56:29.469 --> 00:56:33.598
I'm not against it. I just think
that we need to then also invite

872
00:56:33.681 --> 00:56:35.683
the locals and our neighbors.

873
00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:41.856
Neighbors? [chuckles] Really?

874
00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.985
I need to feel like I'm in this community.
George. not just your community.

875
00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:50.490
Okay. let's do it.

876
00:56:51.282 --> 00:56:53.410
[jazzy piano music playing]

877
00:56:53.993 --> 00:56:56.496
Please tell me again
why I'm carrying a Bundt cake.

878
00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:57.664
[laughs]

879
00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:59.416
We're no good at parties.

880
00:56:59.499 --> 00:57:00.875
Speak for yourself.

881
00:57:00.959 --> 00:57:04.254
I am. Nobody wants the sheriff around
when they're drunk.

882
00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:07.799
-[piano music continues]
-[indistinct chattering]

883
00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:11.344
Uh. more wine?

884
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:16.933
Hi. Wine?

885
00:57:17.016 --> 00:57:18.977
A little. Just… just…

886
00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:21.229
Oh! Okay. good.

887
00:57:22.147 --> 00:57:24.107
She's a friend of Bram's.

888
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:26.401
She's also writing.

889
00:57:27.735 --> 00:57:31.614
They both have been writing novels… Sorry.
They both have been writing novels.

890
00:57:31.698 --> 00:57:33.908
I first wore glasses when I was 13.

891
00:57:33.992 --> 00:57:36.369
Oh. thank you. Thank you. young man.

892
00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:39.372
Yes. You've done a lot with this place.

893
00:57:45.753 --> 00:57:48.840
I want you to meet my wife Millicent.
the love of my life.

894
00:57:48.923 --> 00:57:50.592
It's incredibly nice to meet you.

895
00:57:50.675 --> 00:57:53.595
I hear we might have
a session in your home.

896
00:57:53.678 --> 00:57:55.180
Yeah. soon. I hope. Thank you.

897
00:57:55.263 --> 00:57:58.057
George? Travis. Mare's husband.

898
00:57:58.141 --> 00:58:00.727
-A pleasure to meet you.
-This is her best cake.

899
00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.187
[laughing] Oh. wow.

900
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:04.397
Thank you. We'll put it right here.

901
00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:06.941
[Mare] Travis? Come here.
You've got to hear this.

902
00:58:07.025 --> 00:58:07.984
Yes. dear.

903
00:58:09.277 --> 00:58:11.863
Hm. I almost baked a cake.

904
00:58:13.031 --> 00:58:16.868
Bram insisted there was something
you might appreciate… even more.

905
00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:19.412
Oh… [chuckles]

906
00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:21.664
[sniffs] Oh. fantastic.

907
00:58:21.748 --> 00:58:23.791
-[chuckles]
-Um. shall we?

908
00:58:23.875 --> 00:58:25.585
-Yeah. Why not?
-Why not?

909
00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:29.047
-This place looks marvelous. Catherine.
-Thank you.

910
00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:31.090
Absolutely transformed.

911
00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:34.719
Well. a little paint
goes a really long way.

912
00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:39.349
[sighs] And it does my heart good
to see Eddie and Cole here.

913
00:58:39.432 --> 00:58:42.685
-You're a saint for having them back.
-What do you mean?

914
00:58:43.853 --> 00:58:45.104
Well. they grew up here.

915
00:58:47.899 --> 00:58:50.068
You-- you knew that. didn't you?

916
00:58:51.611 --> 00:58:53.738
I-I-It's just that

917
00:58:53.821 --> 00:58:57.951
I told George the whole story
when I first showed him the house and--

918
00:58:58.034 --> 00:58:59.536
What story?

919
00:59:00.745 --> 00:59:03.873
I suppose he-- he didn't wanna upset you.

920
00:59:04.499 --> 00:59:08.169
-I-- I'm going to go find Travis.
-No. no. no. What story. Mare?

921
00:59:11.256 --> 00:59:13.424
He didn't tell you anything
about their parents?

922
00:59:13.508 --> 00:59:14.342
Hm-mm.

923
00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:18.054
[sighs] Well… it's just that…

924
00:59:19.973 --> 00:59:23.142
Dear Ella. she was a friend of mine.
you know. and… and…

925
00:59:24.185 --> 00:59:27.355
Sometimes. I can't help
but believe that she…

926
00:59:28.565 --> 00:59:29.399
She's free now.

927
00:59:29.482 --> 00:59:32.151
And-- and I know he struggled financially.

928
00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:36.864
but that horrible man was cruel in--
in ways that you could never know.

929
00:59:36.948 --> 00:59:38.074
What happened to them?

930
00:59:39.117 --> 00:59:42.203
Catherine. it's not the time.
I don't want to ruin your party.

931
00:59:42.287 --> 00:59:43.204
No. no.

932
00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:46.708
Mare. I'm begging you.
I need to know this.

933
00:59:48.334 --> 00:59:49.669
[sighs]

934
00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:50.587
All right.

935
00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:53.298
The way I… I heard it

936
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:55.425
was that…

937
00:59:56.134 --> 00:59:57.802
Calvin Vayle

938
00:59:57.885 --> 00:59:59.887
slipped Ella and the boys

939
01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:01.639
a sedative one night.

940
01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:02.557
And…

941
01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:04.851
when they were out cold. he…

942
01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:09.480
He went outside and shot
every one of the cows they owned.

943
01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:10.732
Oh my God.

944
01:00:12.191 --> 01:00:16.529
And then. when he was finished.
he went into the garage below their…

945
01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:18.656
bedroom.

946
01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.410
started the ignition of two trucks
and closed the windows.

947
01:00:22.493 --> 01:00:24.037
The fumes.

948
01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.788
Then he went up and…

949
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.375
laid down in bed with Ella until--

950
01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:32.045
-Oh my God. I was wrong.
-They never woke up.

951
01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:33.588
I had the wrong wife.

952
01:00:33.671 --> 01:00:34.505
I--

953
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:37.800
-Wrong about what?
-Your friend Ella. She's here. Mare.

954
01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:39.886
Oh my God. Where did you get this?

955
01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:41.804
Wh-what are you doing with this?

956
01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:43.348
She never took this ring off.

957
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:44.265
You know what?

958
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:48.269
I've been in this house for three months.
and nobody has said anything to me.

959
01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:51.648
Not the mailman.
not a neighbor. not-- not the bank teller.

960
01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:53.650
God. I'm such a fool!

961
01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:55.485
No. no. it's not like that.

962
01:00:55.568 --> 01:00:58.446
-Oh my God!
-Catherine. we're from farm stock up here.

963
01:00:58.529 --> 01:01:02.533
It's-- it's not our way to get involved
with people's personal business.

964
01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:05.411
You've made this home
so warm and inviting.

965
01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:08.915
and everyone's moved on so well.
I'm sure that George didn't mean--

966
01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:11.376
Do not waste any of your time
on George. Mare.

967
01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:16.798
George Claire always gets
exactly what he wants.

968
01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:22.970
[George] Justine. tell me something
about you I don't know. [blows]

969
01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:27.266
You don't know anything about me.

970
01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:29.727
I do.

971
01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:33.439
I know you're a weaver

972
01:01:34.148 --> 01:01:35.400
of fabrics.

973
01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:37.360
Huh?

974
01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:40.571
And ideas.

975
01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:44.450
Like the ideas you've been putting
in my wife's head lately.

976
01:01:45.159 --> 01:01:46.619
-Mm.
-[George] Mm-hmm.

977
01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:47.912
-Mm.
-[George chuckles]

978
01:01:48.746 --> 01:01:49.831
Okay.

979
01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.626
Here's something about me you don't know.

980
01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.463
I get suspicious

981
01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:00.550
when students worship their professors.

982
01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:02.927
Always leads to trouble.

983
01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:04.595
[chuckles]

984
01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:06.472
Is that a dig or advice?

985
01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:10.226
Oh. it's just honesty.
You know. like the Good Book says.

986
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:12.520
"The truth will set you free."

987
01:02:13.771 --> 01:02:15.398
I don't know about that.

988
01:02:15.481 --> 01:02:17.358
People really don't want the truth.

989
01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:19.819
and they certainly
don't want to be set free.

990
01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:22.113
What? Says who?

991
01:02:22.196 --> 01:02:24.073
The Eagles. remember?

992
01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:25.825
-"Hotel California."
-[Justine laughs]

993
01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:29.454
Yeah. We. uh--
we all choose our own prison.

994
01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.790
Here. give me your hands.

995
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.169
I'll show you why they're right.
Here.

996
01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.504
-You're going to read my palms now?
-Come on.

997
01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:41.257
[Justine sighs]

998
01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:42.967
[George clears throat]

999
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:45.011
[George exhales]

1000
01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.264
Okay.

1001
01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:50.725
Now.

1002
01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:53.644
try to get yourself free.

1003
01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:09.118
[grunts] Okay. that's enough.
You can let go now. George.

1004
01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:12.997
Yeah. I know I can.
but are you sure you really want me to?

1005
01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:15.875
-I'm very sure.
-Oh.

1006
01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:17.877
[laughs]

1007
01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:23.132
George. you-- you are hurting me now.

1008
01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:24.050
Let go!

1009
01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:26.260
[laughing]

1010
01:03:27.261 --> 01:03:28.554
W-what?

1011
01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:32.433
-[laughing]
-Jesus Christ. George.

1012
01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:37.146
Hotel California. Justine.

1013
01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:40.024
Hotel California!

1014
01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:42.026
[laughs]

1015
01:03:43.027 --> 01:03:44.612
[George] Good night.

1016
01:03:44.695 --> 01:03:46.030
-Drive safe.
-[door closes]

1017
01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:51.244
Whoo!

1018
01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:53.913
Well.

1019
01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:57.124
that was a success. huh?

1020
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.005
[dishes clattering]

1021
01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:07.051
Your friend Justine
is a bit of a head case.

1022
01:04:07.134 --> 01:04:09.554
Is she trying to start
some trouble or something?

1023
01:04:10.137 --> 01:04:11.931
No. I didn't see Justine all night.

1024
01:04:12.598 --> 01:04:14.642
but it's interesting that you ask.

1025
01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:21.774
Know what's interesting to me?

1026
01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:27.071
Is that this party was supposed
to bring you and me together.

1027
01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:29.448
and as soon as everyone leaves.

1028
01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.409
you retreat and ice up.

1029
01:04:33.077 --> 01:04:35.830
How could you not tell me
about this house. George?

1030
01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:39.834
[George sighs] Jesus.

1031
01:04:43.504 --> 01:04:45.965
[sighs] I was afraid this might happen.

1032
01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:48.301
That one of your lies would be exposed?

1033
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:53.431
I wasn't lying to you. Cath. I was trying
to spare you some unpleasantness.

1034
01:04:53.514 --> 01:04:58.144
I can handle unpleasantness. George. okay?
I lived through childbirth. remember?

1035
01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.229
I was trying to protect you.

1036
01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:04.150
Believe-- believe it or not.
I-I actually wanted you to be happy here.

1037
01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:06.694
[loud radio static]

1038
01:05:06.777 --> 01:05:08.279
[cacophony of voices on radio]

1039
01:05:12.658 --> 01:05:14.118
What the fuck is that?

1040
01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:17.914
[radio static continues]

1041
01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:19.790
Fucking electricity in this house!

1042
01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:24.837
[radio static continues loudly]

1043
01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:26.422
[George] What the…

1044
01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.968
[static and voices continue]

1045
01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:33.638
The fuck is going on?

1046
01:05:35.973 --> 01:05:37.475
[radio silences]

1047
01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:45.274
Franny's overdue
for a visit with your parents.

1048
01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.401
You can finish off the weekend there.

1049
01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:54.075
[somber music playing]

1050
01:05:54.158 --> 01:05:56.160
[printer whirring]

1051
01:06:04.835 --> 01:06:07.421
-[answering machine beeps]
-Floyd. it's Catherine.

1052
01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:09.966
I'm ready.

1053
01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:14.553
This is her. This is Ella Vayle.

1054
01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:20.226
and this is the article
I found about her death.

1055
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:23.312
But she's trying to…

1056
01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:26.065
She's reaching out to me.
and I-I need to know why.

1057
01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:30.069
You're saying the spirit
is the most recent resident of your house?

1058
01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:32.071
Yes. I was confused before.

1059
01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:36.659
Well. my research turned up something
interesting about the original owners.

1060
01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.245
especially for our group here.

1061
01:06:40.204 --> 01:06:41.539
What? The Smits?

1062
01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:44.125
Reverend Smit's wife

1063
01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:47.169
was an early devotee of Swedenborg.

1064
01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:48.587
[group murmurs]

1065
01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:51.507
[Floyd] Unfortunately.
it was not a happy marriage.

1066
01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:54.301
Smit was a strict Calvinist

1067
01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:58.139
who strongly disapproved
of his wife's philosophic exploration.

1068
01:06:58.222 --> 01:06:59.056
"Damned."

1069
01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.100
[Floyd] She died in their home

1070
01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:04.603
rather mysteriously at age 26.

1071
01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:06.981
So much death in my house.

1072
01:07:07.064 --> 01:07:09.859
Oh. no. no. Don't think of it that way.

1073
01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:13.696
We embrace inhabited houses as a blessing.

1074
01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:16.657
-[Floyd] Mm.
-[Millicent] Portals between two realms

1075
01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:20.369
with guides to shepherd us
once our own time comes.

1076
01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:22.705
Some religions call them guardian angels.

1077
01:07:22.788 --> 01:07:26.000
Perhaps it's our Swedenborgian friend
who first opened the portal door.

1078
01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:27.293
We are good at that.

1079
01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:28.502
[all laughing]

1080
01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:33.007
[Millicent] Because it's the afterlife
where we reach our greatest purpose.

1081
01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:36.886
[laughs] You never see these spirits
as potentially evil?

1082
01:07:36.969 --> 01:07:41.140
An evil spirit
will only commune with an evil-doer.

1083
01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:43.976
[Floyd] Which we will take.
on a leap of faith. that you're not.

1084
01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.312
-[group laughs]
-[local man] And remember.

1085
01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:49.315
Evil only thrives
in the house where it is welcome.

1086
01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:51.817
-[Floyd] Mm.
-[local woman] Goodness always triumphs.

1087
01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:54.779
Always.
If not in this world. then in the next.

1088
01:07:55.613 --> 01:07:56.989
[Floyd] We should start.

1089
01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:57.907
yes?

1090
01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:01.327
Let whomever the spirit is

1091
01:08:02.369 --> 01:08:04.371
speak for herself.

1092
01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:26.519
[tense music plays]

1093
01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:41.450
[electricity buzzing]

1094
01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:47.832
[woman gasps]

1095
01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:49.458
[table vibrating]

1096
01:08:50.876 --> 01:08:52.336
[group screams]

1097
01:08:52.419 --> 01:08:54.421
[ghostly wind shrieking]

1098
01:08:59.593 --> 01:09:01.637
[ghostly voice] As evil comes to light.

1099
01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.597
beware!

1100
01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:08.435
[Floyd] She's making her presence known.
We welcome her. don't we. Catherine?

1101
01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:10.312
We do. We… I-- I do.

1102
01:09:10.896 --> 01:09:12.773
[ghostly voice 2] Get back here!

1103
01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:14.567
-[ghostly voice] No!
-[ghostly voice 2] Ella.

1104
01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:15.776
[ghostly voices grunting]

1105
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:18.320
-[Catherine] What happened?
-[Floyd] She wants to break through.

1106
01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:19.321
She's trying.

1107
01:09:19.405 --> 01:09:21.949
But something. someone is stopping her.

1108
01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:24.910
[ghostly voice] You're suffocating me!

1109
01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:26.120
[group yells]

1110
01:09:29.039 --> 01:09:31.375
[Catherine] What was that? Oh my God.

1111
01:09:45.389 --> 01:09:48.142
I'm afraid this home has another spirit.

1112
01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:52.730
And until that spirit reveals its nature.

1113
01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:57.193
be careful of those around you. Catherine.

1114
01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:02.656
-[Franny] Mama. Mama!
-Hi. baby.

1115
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.451
Come here. Did you have fun
at Grandma and Grandpa's house?

1116
01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:08.454
-Yeah.
-Did you look for seashells on the beach?

1117
01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:10.748
-Mm-hmm.
-Really? Are they pretty?

1118
01:10:10.831 --> 01:10:11.707
Yeah!

1119
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:13.500
Keep moving. everyone. Hustle.

1120
01:10:13.584 --> 01:10:16.670
We don't wanna get caught in traffic
on the way into the city.

1121
01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:18.422
Nearly there. nearly full.

1122
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:21.508
Tommy. good. Thank you for com--

1123
01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:24.345
-Justine.
-George.

1124
01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:27.514
I. uh. I didn't know you were joining us.

1125
01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:30.017
Floyd wanted an additional chaperone.

1126
01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:31.393
[engine turns over]

1127
01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:33.479
[student] I'm here!

1128
01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:36.565
Right. Katie. You're the last.

1129
01:10:40.277 --> 01:10:41.737
[Franny] Where are we going?

1130
01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.573
Get in the car. baby.
I'll be there in a sec.

1131
01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:49.203
Eddie!

1132
01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:52.164
There's something
I have to give you that I. uh…

1133
01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:56.669
found in the house a while back
before I learned the truth.

1134
01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:03.092
It's a little bit tight on me.

1135
01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:06.637
-Just leave it.
-No. no. it belongs to you and Cole.

1136
01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.639
She would want you to have this.

1137
01:11:09.306 --> 01:11:10.432
I don't want it.

1138
01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:14.812
I noticed it on you a couple weeks ago.

1139
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:18.065
Um…

1140
01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:20.192
It just seemed right.

1141
01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:25.239
You and Mom would have liked each other.

1142
01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:34.957
[horn honks]

1143
01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.593
Three on the bottom are on time.

1144
01:11:46.677 --> 01:11:50.431
I found that overdue one
in my husband's car. I can pay the fine.

1145
01:11:50.514 --> 01:11:52.558
It's just on his card.

1146
01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:55.728
Actually. this one's checked out
under the name Willis Howell.

1147
01:11:57.187 --> 01:11:58.939
Oh. that's odd.

1148
01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:02.443
It's unisex. you know?

1149
01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:04.653
Excuse me?

1150
01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:06.780
The name. Willis.

1151
01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:08.741
She's a pretty thing.

1152
01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.951
In here a lot on weekends.

1153
01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:12.161
Daddy's friend.

1154
01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:17.499
Don't worry. I'll ask her to pay the fine.

1155
01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:22.379
I'd like to open a new account.

1156
01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:25.049
Of course. Mrs. Claire.

1157
01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:28.260
Uh. just… just fill out. um.

1158
01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:29.553
this form.

1159
01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:35.976
Uh. we will require George's signature
if it's a joint account.

1160
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.019
It's not.

1161
01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:40.856
[traffic sounds]

1162
01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:48.781
[George] Okay. everyone. Here we are.

1163
01:13:04.004 --> 01:13:05.798
[man] George Claire?

1164
01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:08.050
[chuckles] Good God.

1165
01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:11.762
Dr. Warren. Wow. [chuckles]

1166
01:13:11.845 --> 01:13:13.180
What an odd coincidence.

1167
01:13:13.263 --> 01:13:14.431
Odd indeed.

1168
01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:17.393
I was told
that you had moved away for good.

1169
01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:21.688
Well. I. you know. couldn't resist
coming back for this exhibit.

1170
01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:24.024
You might remember my passion
for Thomas Cole.

1171
01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:28.320
Yes. I do. I just wish you had shown
the same passion for your dissertation.

1172
01:13:30.155 --> 01:13:32.699
Excuse me. Professor Claire. um.

1173
01:13:32.783 --> 01:13:36.412
in the third Voyage of Life painting.
why is the sailor so distraught?

1174
01:13:37.162 --> 01:13:40.457
Oh. the third one is called. uh. Manhood.

1175
01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:45.129
Uh. it's when Cole believes
we. uh. we lose the confidence of youth.

1176
01:13:45.212 --> 01:13:49.091
Uh. go-- go check out the sailor's hands.
They're no longer on the tiller.

1177
01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:51.844
[George chuckles]

1178
01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.680
-[student] Thanks. Professor Claire.
-[Dr. Warren clears throat]

1179
01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:58.725
Yeah… You know. I'm curious. Um…

1180
01:13:59.726 --> 01:14:02.980
How did you get a teaching position
without a recommendation?

1181
01:14:03.564 --> 01:14:06.275
Oh. I'm. um. I'm just a temp instructor.

1182
01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:09.361
Um. one of the professors
took an emergency leave. and I. uh…

1183
01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:11.864
I just stepped in to help.

1184
01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:15.784
Interesting. then. how the students.
uh. they call you professor.

1185
01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:18.579
[chuckling awkwardly] Yeah. yeah.

1186
01:14:18.662 --> 01:14:21.206
Uh. yeah. right. I keep correcting them.

1187
01:14:22.499 --> 01:14:24.877
Yeah. I get so tired of correcting them.

1188
01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:29.006
Good day. Claire.

1189
01:14:33.427 --> 01:14:34.386
What…

1190
01:14:35.345 --> 01:14:36.722
What was all that about?

1191
01:14:38.056 --> 01:14:40.267
Uh. yeah. I have no idea.

1192
01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:45.189
I kind of think you do.

1193
01:14:57.117 --> 01:14:59.495
I don't think
you should see Justine anymore.

1194
01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:02.789
[George sighs]

1195
01:15:04.374 --> 01:15:07.586
There's a lot of talk about her
at Saginaw.

1196
01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:11.590
What kind of talk. George?

1197
01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:15.302
Well. they say she's a closet lesbian.

1198
01:15:16.428 --> 01:15:18.347
And she's clearly obsessed with you.

1199
01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:23.352
[sighs] I think she is…

1200
01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:28.065
instigating problems between us
intentionally.

1201
01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.198
[indistinct chattering]

1202
01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:39.535
[George]
Floyd. heading home for the holiday?

1203
01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:40.953
[Floyd] What?

1204
01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:44.498
Oh. no. no. Not for a while yet.
I-I still have. uh…

1205
01:15:44.581 --> 01:15:46.833
-I have work to finish.
-Is something wrong?

1206
01:15:49.586 --> 01:15:50.629
Actually.

1207
01:15:52.005 --> 01:15:54.716
I got a call this morning
from Shelby Warren.

1208
01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:57.010
your advisor from Columbia.

1209
01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:57.928
Oh?

1210
01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:03.100
His recommendation letter.
the one submitted with your application.

1211
01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:05.686
he claims he never wrote it.

1212
01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:10.649
Shelby's recollection is
that you asked him.

1213
01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.985
but he told you he couldn't do it.

1214
01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:15.821
In good conscience.
I remember the conversation well.

1215
01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:19.157
-You forged it. didn't you?
-No. I… I…

1216
01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:20.075
Oh…

1217
01:16:20.158 --> 01:16:23.120
Floyd. I wrote the letter that I deserved.

1218
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:26.915
I-- I-- You need to understand why.

1219
01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:31.962
As you know.
I'm quite fond of you. George.

1220
01:16:32.045 --> 01:16:36.550
and you're popular with your students.
but this is a serious accusation.

1221
01:16:36.633 --> 01:16:39.261
Can't we put a pin in this
until after the holiday?

1222
01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:40.971
-Oh…
-Please. please. Floyd.

1223
01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:44.766
I-- I understand your dilemma. I do.

1224
01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:50.063
Floyd. I--
I have my entire family up here.

1225
01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:52.899
I'm supposed to be home in an hour.

1226
01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:57.154
I-- I really deserve the chance
to sit down and be heard.

1227
01:16:57.738 --> 01:16:59.448
Man to man. huh?

1228
01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:01.825
Friend to friend.

1229
01:17:04.077 --> 01:17:05.662
I'll schedule an appointment.

1230
01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:10.375
[banging knife]

1231
01:17:13.837 --> 01:17:17.549
[man] I know you all think that Audrey
is a quite calm. conservative soul.

1232
01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:20.594
but back in the day.
she was absolutely wild.

1233
01:17:20.677 --> 01:17:23.513
-Don't believe a word!
-And then George came along.

1234
01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:25.682
And he was always getting into trouble.

1235
01:17:25.766 --> 01:17:27.934
which is why I went gray by 30.

1236
01:17:28.018 --> 01:17:28.977
[Audrey] Oh. stop!

1237
01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:33.231
But the real troublemaker
was this cousin that George idolized.

1238
01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.192
Turned out to be a first-class homo.

1239
01:17:36.109 --> 01:17:39.696
I don't know what was worse for
his parents: that he drowned or was gay.

1240
01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:45.410
That is a truly repugnant thing to say.

1241
01:17:48.121 --> 01:17:49.247
She's right. Tom.

1242
01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.876
Henry's death was a family tragedy.

1243
01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:55.796
He was such a talented young man.

1244
01:17:55.879 --> 01:18:00.550
Henry used to do these exquisite
watercolors. Teeny-tiny paintings.

1245
01:18:01.802 --> 01:18:03.595
What were the… the paintings of?

1246
01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:07.391
Oh. the shoreline. ospreys. lighthouses.

1247
01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:09.267
Just common seaside things.

1248
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.687
Turkey time. everybody.

1249
01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:15.232
It's the way he presented them
that was unique.

1250
01:18:15.899 --> 01:18:19.653
They even wanted to do a showing
of his work after he passed. but…

1251
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:23.865
they all just disappeared. apparently.

1252
01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:26.326
-[Catherine's mom] What a shame.
-It really was.

1253
01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.870
-[man] Nice job on the turkey. George.
-Thank you.

1254
01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:30.622
Please. eat. It's gonna get cold.

01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:40.340
Uh…

1258
01:18:40.924 --> 01:18:42.551
Could you excuse me one minute?

1259
01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:51.101
[retching. spitting]

1260
01:18:56.314 --> 01:18:58.316
So you're starting with all this again?

1261
01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:01.153
I happen to be sick. George.

1262
01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:03.864
Throwing up my marriage.

1263
01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:07.075
Now leave me the fuck alone!

1264
01:19:09.369 --> 01:19:11.663
-Catherine…
-[door slams. lock clicks]

1265
01:19:12.497 --> 01:19:13.749
[George] What the fuck?

1266

[turning door handle]

1267
01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:20.589
Cath? Catherine?

1268
01:19:25.385 --> 01:19:26.386
[Audrey] George?

1269
01:19:26.887 --> 01:19:28.889
[ghostly echo]

1270
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:38.231
[creaking]

1271
01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:42.944
[Ella] Please.

1272
01:19:44.696 --> 01:19:46.573
[deep sighing]

1273
01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:49.409
Please.

1274
01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.582
[male ghostly voice]
No one understands us.

1275
01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:58.126
[car engine idling]

1276
01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:00.212
I am here for you.

1277
01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:05.467
We are your friend.

1278
01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:07.886
George.

1279
01:20:09.596 --> 01:20:11.306
Free yourself.

1280
01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:20.273
[breathing deeply]

1281
01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:24.945

1282
01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:38.458
[Floyd. in distance]
How was your holiday?

1283
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.425
[uneasy music playing]

1284
01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:11.908
Hello. Floyd.

1285
01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:13.910
George.

1286
01:21:14.661 --> 01:21:16.872
I didn't expect to see you till tomorrow.

1287
01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:20.208
Taking advantage
of the warm spell we're having. huh?

1288
01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:24.462
Yeah. I thought I'd go out one last time
before storing her for winter.

1289
01:21:25.255 --> 01:21:27.048
You're so lucky to have her.

1290
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:30.719
That last spin you took me on.
it… [grunts]

1291
01:21:30.802 --> 01:21:33.889
…it really reminded me
how much I-- I miss sailing.

1292
01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:35.891
Especially when…

1293
01:21:36.474 --> 01:21:38.977
when I'm feeling a little… a little low.

1294
01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:41.980
You want to join me?

1295
01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:43.857
Oh. no. I-- I…

1296
01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:46.735
-I don't want to in-- intrude.
-It's fine.

1297
01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:51.239
The river's as good a place as any
to have our talk.

1298
01:22:04.127 --> 01:22:04.961
Hey.

1299
01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:11.468
What's the matter? Are you okay?

1300
01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:20.185
[groans]

1301
01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:21.561
Things…

1302
01:22:23.563 --> 01:22:26.274
just aren't great.

1303
01:22:32.155 --> 01:22:33.156
It's him.

1304
01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:34.616
isn't it?

1305
01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:38.119
[inhales deeply]

1306
01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:39.746
I know his kind all too well.

1307
01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:43.625
I grew up with it.

1308
01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:49.464
If I had someone as good as you.
I'd kiss the fucking ground she walked on.

1309
01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:50.924
I swear to God.

[Catherine grunts softly]

1313
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:30.797
[George] I'm eager to tell you the truth

1314
01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:33.258
about the…

1315
01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:37.178
problems I had at Columbia with…
with Shelby.

1316
01:23:38.304 --> 01:23:40.849
Look. it's a complicated story. but. um…

1317
01:23:41.808 --> 01:23:42.851
essentially.

1318
01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:45.687
I got ostracized…

1319
01:23:47.313 --> 01:23:48.815
for reporting misconduct.

1320
01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:52.318
It was… it was sexual misconduct.

1321
01:23:53.778 --> 01:23:57.741
Look. I'm willing to listen.
because I-- I care about your well-being.

1322
01:23:57.824 --> 01:23:58.700
but forgery.

1323
01:23:58.783 --> 01:24:00.452
regardless of the reason.

1324
01:24:01.077 --> 01:24:02.370
is a crime.

1325
01:24:02.954 --> 01:24:06.041
I don't want us meeting
on false pretenses here.

1326
01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:10.045
I can't keep this to myself forever.

1327
01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:13.965
Yeah. I-I understand that.
and-and. look. I appreciate your dilemma--

1328
01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:14.966
So…

1329
01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:19.596
So tomorrow. I plan
to bring the situation to HR.

1330
01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:23.433
And we both know the outcome.

1331
01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:27.896
They won't permit you to remain on staff.

There. there.

1335
01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:44.537
All things must pass.

1336
01:24:46.372 --> 01:24:47.373
Yeah.

1337
01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:50.543

Sorry. I just wonder…

01:25:16.986 --> 01:25:18.738
Where did you buy that scarf?

1345
01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:21.241
Oh. um…

1346
01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:24.911
It was a gift.

01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:12.834
Are you officially stalking me now?

Officially? No.

1359
01:26:14.544 --> 01:26:17.547
Then why are you suddenly
everywhere I turn?

1360
01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:20.717
Because I really care about Catherine.

1361

Yeah. you've made that perfectly clear.

1362

Uh. I'm not sure how to take that.

1363

I-- I kind of think that you do.

1364
01:26:30.810 --> 01:26:35.190
Tell me. George.
how'd your mom like that scarf I made her?

1365

Uh. yeah. she…

1366
01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.446
She didn't really care for it. actually.

1367
01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:44.324
She… she said that it felt cheap.

1368
01:26:44.949 --> 01:26:47.952
Well. that explains
the neck it ended up on. then. huh?

what happened at the Met?

If you got something to say to me.
Justine. you should just spit it out.

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.429
What are you doing?

[horn honking]

1390
01:28:21.838 --> 01:28:23.339
What happened to your clothes?

1391
01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:26.843
I got sick on them.

1392
01:28:31.681 --> 01:28:33.182
You and I need to talk.

1393
01:28:33.933 --> 01:28:35.476
Not tonight. we don't.

1394
01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:37.270
And why is that?

1395
01:28:37.353 --> 01:28:39.689
Did you not hear me? I said I got sick.

1396
01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:45.194
Sleep down here. then.
I don't wanna catch anything you have.

1397

1398

01:29:18.269 --> 01:29:19.729
What the fuck is going…

1404
01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:37.330
Have your boyfriend
fix the window in the morning.

1405

Hey. it's George Claire.

1410
01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:31.509
Uh. I have an emergency this morning.

1411
01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:34.679
I was wondering if we could get you here
a little bit early.

1412
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:36.264
Can I help you?

1413
01:30:37.348 --> 01:30:39.183
Oh. uh. I need this filled quickly.

1414
01:30:40.893 --> 01:30:42.854
It's for my daughter's night terrors.

1415
01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:45.106
[machine beeping rhythmically]

1416
01:30:54.824 --> 01:30:57.118
They say she might never come out of this.

1417
01:30:57.827 --> 01:30:59.954
The doctor never met Justine.

1418
01:31:00.037 --> 01:31:02.623
He doesn't know
the force of her personality. Bram.

[reporter] …Department of Agriculture.
The announcement comes tomorrow.

In other news. police have identified
the body pulled from the Hudson last night

1421
01:31:15.428 --> 01:31:19.056
as 68-year-old Saginaw professor
Floyd DeBeers.

1422
01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:21.642
a frequent fixture
of the Hudson sailing community.

1423
01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:23.895
What?

1424
01:31:25.104 --> 01:31:28.483
Yeah. I guess he went out
for a sail yesterday and…

1425
01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:32.820
They assumed he had a heart attack
and fell overboard.

1426
01:31:34.197 --> 01:31:35.573
Oh… oh my God.

1427
01:31:38.576 --> 01:31:39.785
[exhales sharply] Jesus.

1428
01:31:39.869 --> 01:31:40.703
Yeah.

1429
01:31:42.371 --> 01:31:44.999
I know you two became very close
very quickly.

1430
01:31:46.125 --> 01:31:48.961
so I-I'll keep you posted
on the memorial service.

1431
01:31:49.045 --> 01:31:50.087
Yeah.

1432
01:31:56.135 --> 01:31:57.345
And…

1433
01:31:57.428 --> 01:32:00.431
we're going to be needing
an interim chair.

1434
01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:01.849
Your name came up.

1435
01:32:01.933 --> 01:32:03.309
if you'd be willing.

1436
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:05.436
Um…

1437
01:32:06.812 --> 01:32:08.105
Oh God. um…

1438
01:32:11.067 --> 01:32:12.193
Yeah. yeah.

1439

[clears throat]

1442
01:32:24.288 --> 01:32:27.250
I have some very sad news to report.

1443
01:32:29.252 --> 01:32:31.128
Some of you may have already heard.

1444

[ominous music playing]

1445
01:32:40.429 --> 01:32:42.348
Wait. Why-- why is this up?

1446
01:32:43.599 --> 01:32:45.226
I-I didn't choose this slide.

1447
01:32:52.275 --> 01:32:53.651
[projector clicking]

[projector continues clicking]

1449
01:33:11.877 --> 01:33:13.004
What is this?

1450
01:33:15.923 --> 01:33:17.258
Huh? Who did this?

1451
01:33:20.678 --> 01:33:22.013
Is this some kind of joke?

1452
01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:25.474
[clicking]

1453
01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:28.019
Who did this? Huh?

1454
01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:32.189
Who did this?

1455
01:33:33.858 --> 01:33:36.193
[yelling]
Who the fuck is responsible for this?

1456
01:33:39.989 --> 01:33:42.783
Well. fuck it. [breathing shakily]

1457
01:33:44.535 --> 01:33:48.205
[ominous music rising]

1458
01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:40.841
You're home early.

1459
01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:43.052
Did you cancel your class?

1460
01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:45.262
Is something wrong. Cath?

1461
01:34:48.432 --> 01:34:49.684
Why?

1462
01:34:49.767 --> 01:34:50.851
Well. you… [scoffs]

1463
01:34:51.644 --> 01:34:53.938
You skipped your protein shake again.

1464
01:34:55.606 --> 01:34:56.524
Thanks.

1465
01:34:58.359 --> 01:34:59.610
Where's Cole?

1466
01:35:01.862 --> 01:35:03.531
He had to leave

1467
01:35:03.614 --> 01:35:06.826
because you had him
come in so early today.

1468
01:35:06.909 --> 01:35:08.202
Right.

1469
01:35:08.285 --> 01:35:09.787
Well. that's good. We can…

1470
01:35:10.663 --> 01:35:12.957
We can sit down.
have that chat you've been pushing for.

1471
01:35:13.666 --> 01:35:15.167
I don't think so. Not tonight.

1472
01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:17.837
Why not tonight?
You said it was extremely important.

1473
01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.588
I don't think that it is anymore.

1474
01:35:27.012 --> 01:35:30.349
-What were you doing upstairs?
-I was putting Franny to bed.

1475
01:35:30.975 --> 01:35:33.686
Oh. what?
I… I can't give her a goodnight kiss?

1476
01:35:33.769 --> 01:35:35.771
Yeah. she was very tired. George.

1477
01:35:45.197 --> 01:35:47.700
You know? I think I'm gonna
give her a kiss anyway.

1478
01:35:47.783 --> 01:35:50.327
No. she's out cold. George. No. she's…

1479
01:35:53.914 --> 01:35:55.332
-George.
-[Franny moans]

1480
01:35:57.835 --> 01:35:58.794
Why is she dressed?

1481
01:35:59.754 --> 01:36:01.130
I told you. She was tired.

1482
01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:06.260
You know that they're expecting
a deep freeze tonight?

1483
01:36:07.553 --> 01:36:09.305
It's a terrible time to travel.

1484
01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:13.517
Hey. where are you going?

1485
01:36:14.059 --> 01:36:15.186
-Hey!

[Catherine grunting]

1494

Where do you think you're going?

1500

With my goddamn daughter!

1501
01:36:52.556 --> 01:36:54.391
-Home!
-This is your fucking home!

1502
01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:56.727
Nowhere's home with you. George!

1503
01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:57.895
Fuck!

1504
01:36:59.063 --> 01:37:00.189
I know about Floyd!

1505
01:37:01.232 --> 01:37:04.610
Your clothes were soaked that night!
And Justine? You hated her.

1506
01:37:04.693 --> 01:37:06.946
I know you were involved.
I know it in my bones.

1507
01:37:07.029 --> 01:37:10.241
And what about that cousin?
That cousin whose identity you stole?

1508
01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:13.869
Oh. you've… you've really
lost your mind. you know that?

1509
01:37:13.953 --> 01:37:17.414
You've-- you've gone way.
way over the edge!

1510
01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:18.791
No. I've woken up.

1511
01:37:18.874 --> 01:37:22.378
And so will Franny
when she learns exactly who her father is.

1512
01:37:23.045 --> 01:37:25.631
You want to leave? Go! Go. if you want to.

1513
01:37:26.465 --> 01:37:30.594
Go. Get up. Leave your daughter
with this. this monster you've conjured up

that they'd put an ax in their gut.

Do you know
if he might have been cheating on her?

Took the art department out for drinks.

1646
01:48:11.443 --> 01:48:13.236
even had the babysitter come.

1647
01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.407
But you said
he could have done it earlier.

1648
01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:19.993
The coroner confirmed as much.

1649
