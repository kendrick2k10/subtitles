she was like. "Was William Wyler Black?"

What was interesting. though.

89
00:05:57.625 --> 00:06:01.416
was that you can tell that
because I'm Black. as the director.

90
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.625
and the woman
is a Black lead. stars in the film.

she's already trying to frame it
through a political lens.

when in reality. it's a film
about a girl trying to get clean.

Now. are there certain obstacles.
because she's a Black woman?

I mean. hell yeah.

95
00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:19.625
Right? That's reality. too.
but it's not a film about race.

96
00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:24.541
No. It's about shame. it's about guilt.
and how that shit is inescapable.

97

that so many of these journalists

that's fundamentally political.

125

but not everything I do
is political because I'm Black.

126

would disagree with you.

to Spike Lee and Barry Jenkins.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.875
The entire night while I was talking to
all those sweet. smiling. rich people who.

171
00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.625
a month ago. wouldn't give me the time
of day. I just kept looking at you.

172
00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:49.958
And I think to myself. "God. you're the
most gorgeous creature on planet Earth."

173
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:51.875
[kisses] And the sexiest too.

174
00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.708
I mean. there's nobody sexier.
Even Anthony said it.

175
00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:56.916
[Marie] Hmm.

176
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.916
[kisses] I mean. not in a bad way.

177
00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:02.250
-[kisses] In a positive way.
-Hmm.

178

179
00:10:03.791 --> 00:10:05.750
[Malcolm breathing heavily and kissing]

180
00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:08.833
When I'd see you…

181
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.583
with your cranberry and soda…

182
00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:16.625
smiling. chopping it up…

183
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.833
And I'd think.
"God. how fucking lucky am I?"

184
00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:26.416
-I couldn't wait to get you home.
-Aww. that's so sweet.

185
00:10:27.208 --> 00:10:30.083
Hold your cute little ass and kiss it.

186
00:10:31.166 --> 00:10:32.458
Tell you that I love you.

187
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.291
I love you. Marie.

188
00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:40.791
-Do you want salted or unsalted butter?
-[softly] I'll just have you.

189
00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:42.500
[kissing]

190
00:10:44.291 --> 00:10:45.291
What was that?

191
00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:47.500
-What?
-That was a fake-ass smile.

192
00:10:47.583 --> 00:10:49.583
-No. it wasn't.
-Swear to God. it was.

193
00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:51.375
[Marie] No. it wasn't. It was nothing.

194
00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.500
Bullshit. I can fucking read you.
I know when nothing is something.

195
00:10:54.583 --> 00:10:56.500
Well. maybe you can't read me.

196
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.958
No. I can read you.

197
00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:01.583
-I haven't eaten all night.
-That's not what this is.

198
00:11:01.666 --> 00:11:03.791
It's 1:00 in the morning.
Can we eat and go to sleep?

199
00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:06.083
Please. Marie.
I really don't wanna fight tonight.

200
00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:10.750
Neither do I.
That is why I'm making you mac and cheese.

201
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.375
So you are angry.

202
00:11:13.458 --> 00:11:14.458
No.

203
00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:17.833
-Was it the thing that Anthony said?
-No.

204
00:11:17.916 --> 00:11:19.791
-The joke about you being a model?
-No.

205
00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:22.708
Wouldn't take it seriously.
He's old and from a totally different era.

206
00:11:22.791 --> 00:11:23.958
I didn't take it personally.

207
00:11:24.791 --> 00:11:26.208
-Promise?
-Promise.

208
00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:29.000
-Was it Taylor?
-No.

209
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:31.166
-You sure?
-Yes.

210
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.458
-I know you get weird around Taylor.
-I do not get weird around Taylor.

211
00:11:34.541 --> 00:11:38.083
-You get meek.
-"Meek"? Huh. really?

212
00:11:38.166 --> 00:11:41.375
-Well. you don't talk a lot.
-Well. that's different from being meek.

213
00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:42.625
-I just mean--
-What?

214
00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:46.166
Meek implies that I'm shy or small.
That she's the queen of fucking England.

215
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.875
-I didn't mean it like that. I meant--
-What?

216
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:49.958
What?

217
00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:52.166
-She's a movie star.
-Hmm.

218
00:11:52.791 --> 00:11:55.875
-She's about to become a movie star.
-Don't jinx her. Malcolm.

219
00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:58.875
I have nothing nice to say to Taylor.
so I don't talk to Taylor.

220
00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.083
-It has nothing to do with being meek.
-It's just… she notices.

221
00:12:03.833 --> 00:12:04.666
Really?

222
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.583
-Really.
-How do you know?

223
00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:09.208
-'Cause I just do.
-Really?

224
00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:12.625
She sees how you are with other people.
You're talkative. You're funny.

225
00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:14.333
What can I say? I'm personable.

226
00:12:14.416 --> 00:12:16.416
[chuckles] Right.
Which is what makes her insecure.

227
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.708
What does? Other fucking
human beings with personalities?

228
00:12:19.791 --> 00:12:22.916
[chuckles] No. The fact that
you're not yourself and she sees it.

229
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.333
[blows]

230
00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:26.041
She'll survive.

231
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.958
[Malcolm] Hmm.

232
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:32.541
So why you angry?

233
00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:33.958
[jazz music becomes louder]

234
00:12:34.041 --> 00:12:35.625
Marie. you're angry.

235
00:12:35.708 --> 00:12:37.875
Marie. what you angry about?

236
00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.250
Marie.

237
00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:41.083
-Marie?
-[dish clatters]

238
00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:42.333
Marie!

239
00:12:43.458 --> 00:12:44.291
Marie.

240
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.875
Marie. talk to me.

241
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.541
I promise you. it's not a good idea.
Let's just talk tomorrow.

242
00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:06.958
-But you're upset with me.
-It's not that big of a deal.

243
00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:08.666
I can't go to bed knowing you're angry.

244
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.833
Malcolm. I promise you.

245
00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:13.458
nothing productive
is going to be said tonight.

246
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:16.000
-How do you know?
-Because I know you.

247
00:13:16.083 --> 00:13:17.833
-What does that mean?
-And I love you.

248
00:13:17.916 --> 00:13:18.958
What does that mean?

249
00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:22.333
It means you are literally incapable
of de-escalating a situation

250
00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:25.125
unless it's work-related.
Even then. it's 50-50.

251
00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:28.208
[blows raspberry] Why is it
that anytime anything good happens.

252
00:13:28.291 --> 00:13:29.833
you have to find something. anything.

253
00:13:29.916 --> 00:13:33.083
the most minor fucking detail
to harp on. to make ugly.

254
00:13:33.166 --> 00:13:36.458
to ensure that there's no reason
to fucking celebrate.

255
00:13:36.541 --> 00:13:38.541
-Really? You wanna go there?
-Yes.

256
00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:41.000
-Okay.
-All right. then. What is it?

257
00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:44.000
-Your speech. Malcolm.
-Oh. give me a break.

258
00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:45.291
You're outside of your mind.

259
00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:48.875
When I said you find the most minor detail
to make it ugly. I meant it.

260
00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958
[grunts] You forgot to thank me. Malcolm.
It's not a minor detail. That's a big one.

261
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.000
But I've thanked you
a million times before.

262
00:13:55.083 --> 00:13:57.250
You know that I'm thankful.
You know I'm appreciative.

263
00:13:57.333 --> 00:14:00.166
You know I made a mistake.
so why turn it into something more?

264
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.666
Because it is more.

265
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.583
What?

266
00:14:03.666 --> 00:14:05.666
It's our entire fucking
relationship in a nutshell.

267
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.083
-Oh. you can't be serious.
-I'm dead serious.

268
00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:09.791
-You're psychotic.
-You're hyperbolic.

269
00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:11.166
I'm not. It's psychotic to think

270
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.458
that forgetting to thank you
is symbolic of anything

271
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:16.125
other than me legitimately
forgetting to fucking thank you.

272
00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:18.041
You thanked 112 fucking people tonight.

273
00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:21.291
You thanked your mother. your gaffer.
your agents. your third grade teacher.

274
00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:24.166
the usher at the theater when you were 12
and saw whatever the fuck.

275
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.041
-Didn't thank the usher.
-You know what I mean.

276
00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:29.166
You don't have to be sarcastic.
petty and obnoxious about the shit.

277
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.833
I'm sorry. I forgot to thank you.

278
00:14:30.916 --> 00:14:32.750
I am genuinely sorry.

279
00:14:32.833 --> 00:14:36.500
which is why I apologized to you
a thousand times during the movie.

280
00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:38.750
I felt so guilty.
I couldn't concentrate on the movie.

281
00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:40.958
Huh. That's a shame.
You've only seen it 7.000 times.

282
00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:44.166
Every time I'd lean over and said.
"I'm sorry." you said it was fine.

283
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.333
You squeezed my hand and said it was fine.

284
00:14:46.416 --> 00:14:48.916
You said. "I love you.
Don't worry. It's fine."

285
00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:54.666
Well. Malcolm. I changed my mind.

286
00:14:56.833 --> 00:14:58.291
How can you just change your mind?

287
00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.541
Honestly. it's pretty fucking easy.

288
00:15:00.625 --> 00:15:02.541
That doesn't seem a little crazy to you?

289
00:15:03.708 --> 00:15:05.208
-Nope.
-It doesn't?

290
00:15:05.291 --> 00:15:07.000
-Nope.
-Why?

291
00:15:07.083 --> 00:15:09.666
Well. because when I was
in the theater. it didn't matter.

292
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.541
Wasn't that big of a deal. It was fine.

293
00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:13.875
Until the after-party.
when every single person.

294
00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.416
from your mother to Taylor.
kept coming up to me and going.

295
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.375
"You know. I bet you're probably
a little bit upset right now

296
00:15:20.458 --> 00:15:24.125
because he forgot to thank you.
but you know how much he depends on you."

297
00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:25.666
[Malcolm] Taylor said that?

298
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:29.000
-Yeah. She told me not to read into it.
-What the hell does that mean?

299
00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:31.458
Funny you should say that.
That's the exact thought I had.

300
00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:33.125
-I didn't cheat on you.
-I didn't ask.

301
00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:34.208
-Just saying--
-Didn't ask.

302
00:15:34.291 --> 00:15:36.583

00:17:56.666 --> 00:17:57.500
Really?

337
00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.500
Are you actually yelling and belittling me
from across this house

338
00:18:01.583 --> 00:18:04.250
because you are too busy
eating mac and cheese?

339
00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:06.000
-What?
-[imitates Malcolm] "What?"

340
00:18:06.833 --> 00:18:08.416
-I'm not.
-Don't fucking lie!

341
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.666
-You literally just got seconds.
-No. I didn't.

342
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.125
Do you know how disturbing it is

343
00:18:12.208 --> 00:18:14.166
that you can compartmentalize
to such a degree

344
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.500
that you can abuse me
while eating mac and cheese?

345
00:18:16.583 --> 00:18:18.625
-Abuse you?
-Mac and cheese I fucking made you.

346
00:18:18.708 --> 00:18:20.375
-Abuse you?
-Verbally abuse me.

347
00:18:20.458 --> 00:18:22.875
Thanks for the clarification.
It's kind of an important one.

348
00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.791
But verbally abuse you? Get out of here.

349
00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:27.916
If you're gonna treat me
like an insane person and call me crazy.

350
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.708
the least you could do is do it without
casually eating macaroni and cheese.

351
00:18:31.791 --> 00:18:33.166
How does that work for you?

352
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.041
What does that sound like
in your fucking brain?

353
00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:38.666
"What a cunt! Mmm.
This macaroni and cheese is delicious."

354
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.541
"What a cunt. I wonder if there's more."

355
00:18:40.625 --> 00:18:43.583
"What a cunt. If I could direct
commercials for Kraft. I would."

356
00:18:43.666 --> 00:18:44.708
Say whatever you want.

357
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:47.958
Get pissed off I didn't thank you. Anthony
said that joke about you being a model.

358
00:18:48.041 --> 00:18:50.791
that Taylor said
whatever the fuck Taylor said--

359
00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:52.833
-It was mean.
-Well. she's an actor.

360
00:18:52.916 --> 00:18:55.500
All night I had to watch you two
smile and take pictures together.

361
00:18:55.583 --> 00:18:58.208
-She's the lead in my film!
-I know. I don't care.

362
00:18:58.291 --> 00:18:59.958
It's my job to make her feel comfortable.

363
00:19:00.041 --> 00:19:01.791
-Not at my expense.
-Actually. it is.

364
00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:03.916
Despite how you fucking
feel about it. it is my job.

365
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
-You'd never forget to thank her.
-Jesus Christ!

366
00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:08.041
-You wouldn't.
-'Cause she's psychotic.

367
00:19:08.125 --> 00:19:09.750
No. because she would flip the fuck out

368
00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:13.875
and spend the night making you pay for it
so you'd never let that shit happen again.

369
00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:15.833
You're saying you're not nuts enough.

370
00:19:15.916 --> 00:19:18.333
No. What I'm saying is
you spend your entire life

371
00:19:18.416 --> 00:19:22.166
catering to the feelings and the whims
of literally everyone but me.

372
00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:26.458
Agents. producers. crew members. actors.

373
00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:29.625
fucking fictional characters
get more respect

374
00:19:29.708 --> 00:19:31.500
and empathy from you than I do.

375
00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:36.333
And… [scoffs] That's what's so odd
about this whole fucking situation.

376
00:19:36.416 --> 00:19:39.166
because I get it.
Taylor is wonderful in the film.

377
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.166
But when you get up there
and you talk about

378
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.625
her ability to breathe life
into the character of Imani

379
00:19:43.708 --> 00:19:49.083
without ever mentioning that if
I didn't live my life. she wouldn't exist.

380
00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:50.541
it's kind of fucking weird.

381
00:19:50.625 --> 00:19:52.083
Imani is not based on you.

382
00:19:52.166 --> 00:19:55.375
She's a 20-year-old drug addict trying
to get clean. Just a fucking coincidence?

383
00:19:55.458 --> 00:19:57.875
Obviously. you getting clean
was a part of the inspiration.

384
00:19:57.958 --> 00:19:59.000
-At 20?
-Yes.

385
00:19:59.083 --> 00:20:01.000
And you provide genuine insight into that.

386
00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:03.375
What that was like.
But Imani is not based on you.

387
00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:06.416
It's an amalgamation
of different things. a bunch of things.

388
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.500
Who?

389
00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:10.541
People!

390
00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:12.083
What people?

391
00:20:13.375 --> 00:20:15.250
A lot of different people.

392
00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:17.208
[Marie] Mmm.

393
00:20:17.291 --> 00:20:19.500
-Like my cousin. Rick. for one.
-Okay.

394
00:20:19.583 --> 00:20:22.041
-A lot of different people and things.
-Your cousin.

395
00:20:25.333 --> 00:20:27.833
-[sighs]
-You know what. Malcolm?

396
00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:33.833
I feel like once you know someone is there
for you and once you know they love you.

397
00:20:34.666 --> 00:20:36.666
you never actually think of them again.

398
00:20:37.916 --> 00:20:39.125
That's not true.

399
00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:42.833
It's not until you're about to lose
someone that you pay attention.

400
00:20:43.916 --> 00:20:45.875
-Is that what this is?
-What?

401
00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:47.791
Is what you're threatening…

402
00:20:47.875 --> 00:20:50.000
if I don't apologize.
I'm going to lose you?

403
00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:52.250
I'm not looking for an apology.

404
00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:55.125
-What do you want? A screenplay credit?
-Don't be cruel.

405
00:20:55.208 --> 00:20:57.625
I'm serious.
I know we talk for hours about work.

406
00:20:57.708 --> 00:21:00.458
Is it so much of a nuisance
that you'd like compensation?

407
00:21:00.541 --> 00:21:03.166
I had a draft of the script
before you ever came into my life.

408
00:21:04.041 --> 00:21:06.291
It's not about credit.
I don't want fucking credit.

409
00:21:06.375 --> 00:21:08.625
Well. what is it. Marie? What do you want?

410
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:12.625
The film is beautiful.

411
00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:15.041
I'm proud of you.

412
00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:18.083
Took forever to make and it was tough.
but I have one question.

413
00:21:18.166 --> 00:21:22.916
Do you think that the movie would be
as good as it is if we weren't together?

414
00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:29.375
No.

415
00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:35.500
And that's all I wish you would have said.

416
00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:44.875
Great.

417
00:21:46.208 --> 00:21:47.875
Are we no longer fighting?

418
00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:52.625
That depends.

419
00:21:54.083 --> 00:21:55.083
On what?

420
00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:57.375
On whether you can manage
to not say something hurtful

421
00:21:57.458 --> 00:21:58.666
for the rest of the night.

422
00:22:02.416 --> 00:22:03.791
I mean. I'm not that bad.

423
00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:04.916
[inhales sharply]

424
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.875
Fuck you aren't. [sighs]

425
00:22:11.791 --> 00:22:12.791
Can I kiss you?

426
00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:14.583
No.

427
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.125
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hmm.

428
00:22:22.125 --> 00:22:23.166
[Malcolm sighs]

429
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.125
But I really. really wanna kiss you.

430
00:22:28.375 --> 00:22:29.541
[softly] I don't care.

431
00:22:40.708 --> 00:22:42.291
Just don't take me for granted.

432
00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:46.333
I don't.

433
00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:53.958
You did.

434
00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:57.541
I'm sorry.

435
00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:06.791
You can kiss me now.

436
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:09.000
-[softly] Yes!
-[chuckles softly]

437
00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:20.708
I'm the only person who tells you
you're being an asshole

438
00:23:20.791 --> 00:23:22.250
when you're being an asshole.

439
00:23:24.416 --> 00:23:25.416
[Malcolm] I know.

440
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.875
And now…

441
00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:33.541
that you've made a movie
that everybody loves…

442
00:23:34.958 --> 00:23:37.375
-the world's gonna be kissing your ass.
-[chuckles]

443
00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:39.208
-You think so?
-Mm-hmm.

444
00:23:40.125 --> 00:23:41.125
Yep.

445
00:23:41.791 --> 00:23:45.791
I heard that shit all night.
"Oh. he's so sensitive."

446
00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:49.083
"He's so in tune to emotion.
He's romantic."

447
00:23:49.166 --> 00:23:50.541
"I bet he's sweet. right?"

448
00:23:51.375 --> 00:23:54.916
-What did you say?
-I said. "Well. I mean. yeah."

449
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.666
"When he's not being
an emotional fucking terrorist."

450
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.125
[groans and laughs]

451
00:23:59.208 --> 00:24:00.875
[jazz music playing]

452
00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:03.250
Yes.

453
00:24:05.208 --> 00:24:06.166
-Yes.
-No.

454
00:24:06.875 --> 00:24:08.125
-[Malcolm grunts]
-Mmm.

455
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.750
You think you're tough.
skinny-bones Jones?

456
00:24:11.833 --> 00:24:12.916
I am tough.

457
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.333
Nah. I'll eat your ass for breakfast.
You light work.

458
00:24:30.166 --> 00:24:33.958
[Marie] You know. life is gonna get
easier. but it's also gonna get harder.

459
00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:37.500
[Malcolm] What do you mean?

460
00:24:40.833 --> 00:24:42.750
Just don't believe the hype. Malcolm.

461
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.833
[kisses]

462
00:24:46.916 --> 00:24:49.583
And don't push away
the people who ground you.

463
00:24:52.333 --> 00:24:53.916
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

464
00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.833
[Marie] You're gonna
start making fake movies

465
00:25:02.916 --> 00:25:07.291
about fake people with fake emotions.

466
00:25:07.958 --> 00:25:09.416
[both chuckle]

467
00:25:10.291 --> 00:25:14.041
Then you'll start having dinner
with the white girl from LA Times.

468
00:25:14.125 --> 00:25:15.666
[both laughing]

469
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.291
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-[Malcolm] No! Not the white girl.

470
00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:22.791
You'll be talking about
this one-take and… and that one-take.

471
00:25:22.875 --> 00:25:23.958
and how the camera…

472
00:25:24.041 --> 00:25:26.458
-[laughing]
-You know you do that. right?

473
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:28.416
-[laughing]
-Literally.

474
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:33.833
Next thing you know. you'll be on
your press tour for your new LEGO film.

475
00:25:33.916 --> 00:25:37.833
Talk about how it's an allegory
for the failures of reconstruction.

476
00:25:37.916 --> 00:25:39.000
[Malcolm chuckles]

477
00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:42.041
[Marie] "Well.
the original working title was…

478
00:25:42.125 --> 00:25:45.625
-Forty LEGOs And A Mule. but the…"
-[both laughing]

479
00:25:45.708 --> 00:25:48.375
"The studio got a little. uh…"

480
00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:49.541
[chuckling]

481
00:25:49.625 --> 00:25:51.791
[Malcolm laughing]

482
00:25:51.875 --> 00:25:53.208
[Marie] Mm-hmm.

483
00:25:53.291 --> 00:25:55.500
Malcolm. you laugh. but I can see it.

484
00:25:55.583 --> 00:25:58.083
-I'm serious. I can see that shit.
-[Malcolm laughs]

485
00:25:58.166 --> 00:26:01.458
[Marie] All your new Twitter friends
will be quote-tweeting your ass.

486
00:26:01.541 --> 00:26:05.458
handclaps and shit. talkin' 'bout.
"This is what change looks like."

487
00:26:05.541 --> 00:26:06.666
"Yes. king!"

488
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.250
-[Malcolm] Oh. brutal.
-Mm-hmm.

489
00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:09.916
But the rest of America will be like.

490
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.500
"What the fuck is this Negro doing
selling us some shit with these LEGOs?"

491
00:26:13.583 --> 00:26:15.416
"I'm not seein' that shit."

492
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.541
[both laughing]

493
00:26:17.625 --> 00:26:20.125
Then there's
gonna be boycotts. fucking protests

494
00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:21.875
because you're politicizing these LEGOs.

495
00:26:21.958 --> 00:26:26.541
but thankfully. you'll have your new
white girlfriend from the LA Times.

496
00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:30.041
I mean. she's gonna come ridin' in
with her SPF-50 brigade

497
00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:32.375
-on some real soccer mom shit…
-[Malcolm laughing]

498
00:26:32.458 --> 00:26:34.833
…tweetin' at people left and right.

499
00:26:34.916 --> 00:26:37.541
"Well. this is literally censorship!"

500
00:26:37.625 --> 00:26:39.208
"Who is in charge here?"

501
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:42.416
"It is our moral obligation
to go and see this movie

502
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:47.041
written and directed by a real Bla…
I mean. person of color."

503
00:26:47.125 --> 00:26:48.958

-[sniffles]
-[glass clatters]

673
00:36:53.875 --> 00:36:54.875
[sighing]

674
00:36:56.958 --> 00:36:59.416
All right. how about
we cut the bullshit. Malcolm?

675
00:37:00.333 --> 00:37:04.125
Since everybody's being honest tonight.
how about you be honest? Hmm?

676
00:37:04.625 --> 00:37:06.791
About the real reason
you were there for me.

677
00:37:11.291 --> 00:37:13.208
I was good fucking material.

678
00:37:15.958 --> 00:37:18.791
Hmm? That's why you stuck by me.

679
00:37:19.958 --> 00:37:21.375
Because I was a story.

680
00:37:21.458 --> 00:37:25.041
It was a world of emotions you weren't
used to seeing so fucking close.

681
00:37:25.125 --> 00:37:28.541
And because I was 20 years old and I'd
never been loved the way you loved me

682
00:37:28.625 --> 00:37:31.583
or thought you loved me.
I didn't realize what I was to you.

683
00:37:32.916 --> 00:37:35.750
A fucking movie. A tragedy.

684
00:37:35.833 --> 00:37:38.958
One that you could continue watching
for as long as you were there for me.

685
00:37:39.041 --> 00:37:42.250
And tonight. in that fucking audience.
I watched the whole shit play out.

686
00:37:42.333 --> 00:37:45.541
So don't pretend like it was
a selfless fucking act. Malcolm.

687
00:37:46.125 --> 00:37:49.208
It's literally the basis of your art
and it is the reason

688
00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:52.791
why all these people are calling you
brilliant and brave and fearless.

689
00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:56.916
[scoffs]

690
00:37:57.583 --> 00:37:59.166
"So tell us. Malcolm."

691
00:38:00.958 --> 00:38:03.583
"How were you able to breathe life
into the character of Imani?"

692
00:38:03.666 --> 00:38:06.625
"How were you able
to channel the voice of a young woman

693
00:38:06.708 --> 00:38:08.666
so well. so authentically?"

694
00:38:09.416 --> 00:38:10.333
"Hmm."

695
00:38:11.125 --> 00:38:15.500
"Well. Jennifer. that's a good question.
I guess you could say I stole it."

696
00:38:15.583 --> 00:38:17.000
"I ripped it off."

697
00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:20.166
"Not a literal theft. a spiritual one."

698
00:38:21.375 --> 00:38:22.625
You're a fucking fraud.

699
00:38:22.708 --> 00:38:26.208
The reason you didn't thank me tonight
is because you already know that.

700
00:38:26.291 --> 00:38:30.125
[scoffing] You have nothing new to say.

701
00:38:30.208 --> 00:38:33.250
[laughs] All you can do is fuckin' mimic.

702
00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:35.541
Be a fucking parakeet. a goddamn cockatoo.

703
00:38:35.625 --> 00:38:38.333
I mean. God forbid you are ever alone.

704
00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:40.666
and have to dream up
another original idea.

705
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.833
What are you going to write. Malcolm?

706
00:38:44.208 --> 00:38:45.166
Huh?

707
00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:47.625
Yourself?

708
00:38:49.458 --> 00:38:51.000
Give me a fucking break.

709
00:38:51.875 --> 00:38:54.041
You don't have the balls. [slaps leg]

710
00:38:54.125 --> 00:38:57.958
You don't have the gravitas. the fucking
introspection to look at yourself

711
00:38:58.041 --> 00:38:59.958
and your flaws and your shortcomings

712
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:02.791
and the fact that you may not be
the next Spike Lee or Barry Jenkins

713
00:39:02.875 --> 00:39:05.708
because those motherfuckers
had something new to say.

714
00:39:05.791 --> 00:39:09.291
Something true to themselves
and their fucking experience.

715
00:39:10.458 --> 00:39:13.500
You say the film is about shame and guilt.

716
00:39:13.583 --> 00:39:15.125
-[pouring liquid]
-Correct?

717
00:39:15.958 --> 00:39:17.333
Your words. not mine.

718
00:39:18.333 --> 00:39:20.916
All right. Well. I have
a question for you. Malcolm.

719
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.791
Whose fucking shame?

720
00:39:23.458 --> 00:39:25.166
Whose guilt?

721
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:28.291
What the fuck do you know
about shame and guilt?

722
00:39:28.375 --> 00:39:31.458
You have two parents. no bad habits
other than being a fucking prick.

723
00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:32.666
and a college education.

724
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:35.250
Your mother is a therapist.
Your father is a professor.

725
00:39:35.333 --> 00:39:38.000
Your sister works for a think tank in D.C.

726
00:39:38.083 --> 00:39:42.333
But out here. on these streets.
these smiling fucking rich people.

727
00:39:42.416 --> 00:39:44.916
they think you know
what it's like to scrap.

728
00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:49.375
Think you fucking lived it.
Give me a break.

729
00:39:50.666 --> 00:39:53.750
You're more privileged than the white girl
who works for the LA Times.

730
00:39:53.833 --> 00:39:57.083
who thinks she's doing a public service
by lifting up your mediocre ass.

731
00:39:57.875 --> 00:39:58.875
Now you're being cruel.

732
00:39:58.958 --> 00:40:01.750
Try slitting your wrists
with a pair of nail scissors.

733
00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:07.333
You're not gonna wanna survive it.
because it's embarrassing.

734
00:40:07.416 --> 00:40:08.250
Don't worry.

735
00:40:08.333 --> 00:40:11.291
I'm not so petty I throw it out
in argument because I'm angry.

736
00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:13.416
-I didn't mean it.
-Too late.

737
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.958
It's embarrassing and it's cruel.

738
00:40:17.041 --> 00:40:19.416
and it makes me regret
sharing so much with you.

739
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.000
-[softly] Fucking calling me…
-[door shuts]

740
00:40:30.541 --> 00:40:34.833
[mumbling profanity]

741
00:40:34.916 --> 00:40:37.041
-[instrumental music playing]
-[water running]

742
00:40:41.791 --> 00:40:43.291
[foot tapping]

743
00:40:55.583 --> 00:40:59.375
-[crickets chirping]
-[muttering] I'm keeping you…

744
00:41:10.958 --> 00:41:11.791
Bullshit!

745
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.541
How the fuck am I keeping you from a life?

746
00:41:26.625 --> 00:41:27.875
So stupid.

747
00:41:31.333 --> 00:41:32.458
[grunting]

748
00:41:37.125 --> 00:41:38.083
Fucking bullshit.

749
00:41:46.208 --> 00:41:47.958
[mumbling indistinctly]

750
00:41:55.166 --> 00:41:57.916
I know… I know what this is.
This is bullshit.

751
00:42:02.416 --> 00:42:03.583
Fuck Malibu.

752
00:42:08.375 --> 00:42:09.583
[banging]

753
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.500
What do you mean. "mediocre"?

754
00:42:13.333 --> 00:42:14.458
[Marie inhales deeply]

755
00:42:15.375 --> 00:42:16.708
[water gurgling]

756
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:18.458
[door slides open]

757
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.583
Were you just trying to be mean?

758
00:42:23.208 --> 00:42:24.416
Is that why you said it?

759
00:42:32.166 --> 00:42:33.458
Out of everything I said.

760
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:36.791
"mediocre" is what stuck with you?

761
00:42:37.458 --> 00:42:39.666
I just wanna know
if you actually believe it.

762
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:43.583
Guess.

763
00:42:44.083 --> 00:42:47.333
-Answer the question.
-What is the question specifically?

764
00:42:47.416 --> 00:42:49.166
Do you not like the movie?

765
00:42:50.125 --> 00:42:51.166
I never said that.

766
00:42:53.791 --> 00:42:56.208
-So you don't like me and the movie.
-I never said that.

767
00:42:56.291 --> 00:42:58.125
That's literally
what you just fucking said.

768
00:42:59.083 --> 00:43:00.958
I feel like you're being a bit irrational.

769
00:43:01.041 --> 00:43:02.166
I'm being irrational?

770
00:43:02.958 --> 00:43:05.916
I'm being fucking irrational?
This is the biggest night of my life.

771
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.041
and you're trying to turn it
into the worst and I'm being irrational.

772
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:10.750
Look at you.

773
00:43:10.833 --> 00:43:13.625
You're so solipsistic
that you see yourself in everything.

774
00:43:13.708 --> 00:43:15.708
Even in things you had nothing to do with.

775
00:43:15.791 --> 00:43:17.375
You notice the way Imani walks.

776
00:43:17.458 --> 00:43:20.333
You turn to me and say.
"I wonder where you got that walk from."

777
00:43:20.416 --> 00:43:22.458
I don't say shit.
I actually smile. don't I?

778
00:43:22.541 --> 00:43:25.333
Keep that shit light
because I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

779
00:43:25.416 --> 00:43:27.541
but you tally that shit up. Marie.

780
00:43:27.625 --> 00:43:30.083
While I'm actually
doing something. creating something.

781
00:43:30.166 --> 00:43:33.791
you're on the sidelines trying to justify
your motherfucking existence.

782
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:39.791
"I know that line." "I said that."
"I did that." "You got that from me."

783
00:43:39.875 --> 00:43:43.250
Shit. even feedback from you
comes with an IOU. Marie.

784
00:43:43.333 --> 00:43:45.500
You wanna play fucking dirty?

785
00:43:46.083 --> 00:43:47.291
Well. let's fucking go.

786
00:43:48.833 --> 00:43:50.208
You wanna hurt me. Marie.

787
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.166
I promise you.
I can hurt you ten times worse.

788
00:43:55.166 --> 00:43:57.791
You're a fucking featherweight.
a level-one boss.

789
00:43:57.875 --> 00:43:59.833
I can snap you like a twig.

790
00:44:01.875 --> 00:44:04.291
Imani is based on you
as much as she is on me.

791
00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:05.625
What she says to the nurse.

792
00:44:05.708 --> 00:44:09.833
that's what I said to the doctor
when my dad was in the ICU.

793
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.375
You noticed the way
Imani walks. didn't you?

794
00:44:14.083 --> 00:44:15.166
It's a good walk.

795
00:44:15.916 --> 00:44:18.208
That was my ex-girlfriend. Jess.

796
00:44:19.708 --> 00:44:21.708
So was the scene
on the bicycle in the rain.

797
00:44:21.791 --> 00:44:23.916
It wasn't based on the trip
you and I took to Barcelona.

798
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.833
That's Jess and I
on the Citi Bike in Brooklyn.

799
00:44:28.541 --> 00:44:31.083
The way she ties her shoes with two loops…

800
00:44:32.083 --> 00:44:33.291
That was Jayla.

801
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:35.416
You weren't the first.

802
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.041
The joke about
how she doesn't give handjobs.

803
00:44:38.125 --> 00:44:41.666
Well. that's an old played-out line
that every nigga done heard before.

804
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:46.125
The joke she makes
about how quickly she orgasms.

805
00:44:47.583 --> 00:44:48.583
That was Kiki.

806
00:44:49.416 --> 00:44:50.666
Kiki.

807
00:44:51.708 --> 00:44:53.083
She's a dancer.

808
00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:56.833
Dancer. We'll call her a dancer.

809
00:44:58.333 --> 00:45:00.833
Who I met
outside of St. Louis on a road trip.

810
00:45:00.916 --> 00:45:04.375
I fucked the shit out of her
in the penthouse suite of a Marriott.

811
00:45:04.458 --> 00:45:07.083
Once on the bed. once in the shower.

812
00:45:07.166 --> 00:45:09.916
We might've even fucked
in the closet or some shit too.

813
00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:12.166
I got a Polaroid of her.

814
00:45:13.666 --> 00:45:16.583
Sitting naked in a heart-shaped tub.

815
00:45:16.666 --> 00:45:19.416
It's in a photo album
at home in our closet.

816
00:45:22.083 --> 00:45:23.500
But you're an addict. right?

817
00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.500
That's what makes you so unique. right?

818
00:45:26.583 --> 00:45:29.958
That's what makes your contribution
so much more significant. right?

819
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.833
Get the entire fuck out of here.

820
00:45:33.916 --> 00:45:37.500
You're not the first broken girl
I've known. fucked or dated.

821
00:45:38.125 --> 00:45:41.208
I wrote my first script
in a one-bedroom apartment with Leah.

822
00:45:41.291 --> 00:45:43.625
who I thought loved hour-long showers

823
00:45:43.708 --> 00:45:47.291
until I found her passed out
with a fucking needle in her arm.

824
00:45:47.958 --> 00:45:50.708
Two years ago.
I got an email from her sister

825
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:53.958
saying she took a whole bottle
of Tylenol to the head and passed away

826
00:45:54.041 --> 00:45:55.333
and asked if I had any pictures

827
00:45:55.416 --> 00:45:57.833
'cause she was putting together
a slideshow on her behalf.

828
00:45:57.916 --> 00:46:00.291
Now that I think about it.
I should've thanked her tonight.

829
00:46:00.375 --> 00:46:01.500
She deserves it.

830
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:09.375
Same with Tasha.

831
00:46:10.791 --> 00:46:13.000
First girl I actually loved.
I truly loved.

832
00:46:13.083 --> 00:46:14.750
The first girl who truly broke my heart.

833
00:46:14.833 --> 00:46:17.208
She never cheated on me.
She's got that going for her.

834
00:46:17.291 --> 00:46:19.708
She found Jesus.
got married. got divorced.

835
00:46:19.791 --> 00:46:23.000
She constantly DMs me
pictures of her daughter

836
00:46:23.083 --> 00:46:25.500
saying she wished she had a child with me.

837
00:46:26.291 --> 00:46:30.333
I send her heart emojis because I honestly
don't know how to respond to that.

838
00:46:31.916 --> 00:46:33.000
Are you done?

839
00:46:35.541 --> 00:46:37.291
Not even fucking close.

840
00:46:39.333 --> 00:46:40.916
Why. would you like me to stop?

841
00:46:43.583 --> 00:46:46.125
[quietly] No. Malcolm. Keep going.

842
00:46:46.208 --> 00:46:47.875
-Why?
-Hmm.

843
00:46:49.625 --> 00:46:50.958
'Cause you like that shit?

844
00:46:52.541 --> 00:46:55.041
You know how disturbed you are. Marie?

845
00:46:55.125 --> 00:46:58.083
You may have gotten clean. but
you still haven't figured this part out.

846
00:46:58.166 --> 00:47:01.916
Why you love being hurt.
traumatized and fucking eviscerated?

847
00:47:03.791 --> 00:47:04.625
It's not normal.

848
00:47:04.708 --> 00:47:08.125
It's not healthy. and it permeates
every aspect of our relationship.

849
00:47:08.208 --> 00:47:12.541
The way we talk.
the way we fight. the way we fuck.

850
00:47:12.625 --> 00:47:15.541
I've dated some
damaged people in my life. Marie.

851
00:47:15.625 --> 00:47:19.500
But none of them wanted to be
debased and degraded like you.

852
00:47:20.458 --> 00:47:22.041
And honestly. Marie…

853
00:47:24.125 --> 00:47:25.833
it's nothing to be proud of.

854
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
So stop fucking smiling.
'cause you look like a clown.

855
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.500
Now there's some material for you.

856
00:47:45.166 --> 00:47:47.166
[footsteps receding]

857
00:48:03.875 --> 00:48:06.750
You know what I just realized. Marie?

858
00:48:09.333 --> 00:48:11.541
It's not about justifying your existence.

859
00:48:12.916 --> 00:48:13.916
It's not.

860
00:48:15.208 --> 00:48:17.458
It's about you
being so scared and so selfish

861
00:48:17.541 --> 00:48:19.333
that you have to break me down.

862
00:48:20.875 --> 00:48:22.708
Second guess everything I do.

863
00:48:23.375 --> 00:48:24.916
"Am I mediocre?"

864
00:48:25.625 --> 00:48:27.541
"Can I do this without her?"

865
00:48:27.625 --> 00:48:31.500
"I don't know. I better ask Marie.
Maybe Marie will know the answer."

866
00:48:31.583 --> 00:48:33.458
"Where's Marie?
I need Marie." That's a cut.

867
00:48:33.541 --> 00:48:34.916
"Marie. where did you go?"

868
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.958
"Did you see that performance?
What'd you think?"

869
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:38.958
"You liked it? Yeah. me too."

870
00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:44.125
God forbid I'm secure enough
in my opinion that I don't need you.

871
00:48:45.541 --> 00:48:47.333
That's what this all is about.

872
00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:50.166
Your whole speech about fake films.

873
00:48:52.125 --> 00:48:54.625
You just need a reason to be needed

874
00:48:54.708 --> 00:48:59.000
because if I don't need you. then
what the hell am I doing with you. Marie?

875
00:49:00.875 --> 00:49:02.208
You want control

876
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:06.333
because you can't imagine the reason
I'm with you is because I love you.

877
00:49:08.416 --> 00:49:10.291
I just love you. baby.

878
00:49:11.791 --> 00:49:13.041
I don't need you.

879
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.625
But I love you. That there's somebody
on this planet that just loves you.

880
00:49:19.333 --> 00:49:21.958
I love the way your mind works. Marie.

881
00:49:23.208 --> 00:49:24.083
I do.

882
00:49:24.625 --> 00:49:27.375
I love the way you see the world.

883
00:49:28.291 --> 00:49:30.500
I love the way you think.

884
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:32.125
Your instincts.

885
00:49:32.208 --> 00:49:36.375
And I'm so fucking grateful

886
00:49:36.458 --> 00:49:39.916
because everything
that you've been through. everything…

887
00:49:42.166 --> 00:49:44.500
That's what made you you.
That's what made you you.

888
00:49:44.583 --> 00:49:46.541
The girl that I love.
the girl that I fuck with.

889
00:49:46.625 --> 00:49:48.958
the girl that I'm up
at 2:00 a.m. in the morning

890
00:49:49.041 --> 00:49:54.125
on the biggest night of my life
because she's relentless. [laughing]

891
00:49:57.041 --> 00:49:58.250
And crazy.

892
00:50:00.708 --> 00:50:03.750
[voice shaking]
And I'm sorry. though. I'm sorry.

893
00:50:04.875 --> 00:50:07.875
I apologized. you know. and…

894
00:50:09.375 --> 00:50:11.750
a thousand times. I know I fucked up.

895
00:50:12.625 --> 00:50:15.916
But honestly. the second we got home.

896
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.916
all I wanted to do
was celebrate with you. baby.

897
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:22.458
Marie. my girl. the love of my life.

898
00:50:26.875 --> 00:50:30.333
You wanna know the part
of Imani that's based on you?

899
00:50:33.833 --> 00:50:34.833
It's the end.

900
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.833
The part that makes it
such a tragedy. The part…

901
00:50:39.791 --> 00:50:40.916
that she…

902
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.833
Where she loathes herself so much
because of all the guilt and the shame.

903
00:50:47.875 --> 00:50:49.666
That she can't let the good in.

904
00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:54.875
That's the part that's based on you.

905
00:50:57.666 --> 00:50:59.916
Her inability to fathom

906
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.291
that there's someone
on this planet Earth that just loves her.

907
00:51:06.541 --> 00:51:08.625
Despite her not loving herself.

908
00:51:13.333 --> 00:51:14.333
That's you.

909
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.583

-I fucking hate this woman.
-[chuckles]

1009
00:58:34.916 --> 00:58:36.250
Who wants to see that film?

1010
00:58:36.333 --> 00:58:38.125
"Cinematic tour de force" is all I heard.

1011
00:58:38.208 --> 00:58:41.166
-You didn't hear "jazzy"?
-No. I heard "jazzy." too.

1012
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:44.333
"Like the opening Steadicam shot."
It's a dolly. you fucking idiot.

1013
00:58:44.416 --> 00:58:46.458
"Through the streets of Bed-Stuy.
we know one thing

1014
00:58:46.541 --> 00:58:49.458
about our slender protagonist Imani.
She marches to her own beat."

1015
00:58:49.541 --> 00:58:51.791
"She sets the tone.
the atmosphere. the vibe."

1016
00:58:51.875 --> 00:58:54.875
"She may slink and slide through
halfway houses and in-patient hospitals.

1017
00:58:54.958 --> 00:58:57.333
but make no mistake.
as the title suggests.

1018
00:58:57.416 --> 00:59:00.833
this is her film. her world. her turf.
Until it's not."

1019
00:59:00.916 --> 00:59:03.208
"If you can't tell
by the rhythm of my white girl words.

1020
00:59:03.291 --> 00:59:04.750
you are in for a Black film."

1021
00:59:04.833 --> 00:59:07.458
[chuckling] The synopsis.
Boring. boring. boring.

1022
00:59:07.541 --> 00:59:11.500
The only reason you know it's 2-perf 35 is
because I said it at the premier. dipshit.

1023
00:59:11.583 --> 00:59:12.666
"Positive…"

1024
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:14.708
"Leading to a harrowing
and indelible scene

1025
00:59:14.791 --> 00:59:17.083
where Imani overdoses
at a Chinatown market.

1026
00:59:17.166 --> 00:59:19.458
and that's where Elliot's
true target becomes clear."

1027
00:59:19.541 --> 00:59:22.833
"This is a film about how the American
healthcare system treats women of color."

1028
00:59:22.916 --> 00:59:24.208
And at this precise moment.

1029
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:26.791
every Negro who subscribes
to the LA Times just said.

1030
00:59:26.875 --> 00:59:28.750
"Then why the fuck
do I need to see this film?"

1031
00:59:28.833 --> 00:59:31.333
Just 'cause the film doesn't star
anybody that looks like her

1032
00:59:31.416 --> 00:59:32.833
doesn't mean it's political.

1033
00:59:32.916 --> 00:59:36.333
-What's wrong with being political?
-Political films are exhausting.

1034
00:59:36.416 --> 00:59:37.958
[Marie] You love political films.

1035
00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:40.958
Not the ones the white woman
from the LA Times calls political.

1036
00:59:41.041 --> 00:59:42.583
I'm sure she loves Do The Right Thing.

1037
00:59:42.666 --> 00:59:46.416
Made at a time when politics weren't cool.
That's what made it so revolutionary.

1038
00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:48.541
"When Imani is placed under 5150.

1039
00:59:48.625 --> 00:59:50.541
a term for people
being held against their will

1040
00:59:50.625 --> 00:59:52.416
and being a danger
to themselves and others.

1041
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:55.875
after a harrowing scene
with a pair of nail scissors. she…"

1042
00:59:55.958 --> 00:59:58.916
"She's placed
under the care of friendly doctor

1043
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.458
played by… TV show fame…"

1044
01:00:02.541 --> 01:00:05.125
"But Elliot knows
the waters he's wading into.

1045
01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:09.291
and carefully. brilliantly subverts
the white savior trope."

1046
01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:11.625
Oh. she's on one now. This fucking stupid…

1047
01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:14.666
"Later. when Imani finds herself. uh…

1048
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:17.750
at her ex-boyfriend's house
begging for a fix.

1049
01:00:17.833 --> 01:00:21.083
Elliot uses tight lenses."
It's the fucking same lens.

1050
01:00:21.166 --> 01:00:22.833
"Claustrophobia…"

1051
01:00:22.916 --> 01:00:25.125
"One begins to question his intentions

1052
01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:28.375
in reveling in the trauma
of his Black female heroine for so long."

1053
01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.208
"It's a scene
better implied than depicted."

1054
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:32.416
"If not for the restraint
of his own picture.

1055
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.833
then merely to separate itself
from an exhaustive history

1056
01:00:34.916 --> 01:00:37.583
that depicts gendered violence
against women of fucking color."

1057
01:00:37.666 --> 01:00:40.583
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you kidding me. ma'am?

1058
01:00:40.666 --> 01:00:44.125
Are you fucking-- In the next line!
Oh. shit! Oh. shit!

1059
01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:47.041
She says it's a "genuine masterwork."
A genuine fucking--

1060
01:00:47.125 --> 01:00:50.416
I can't read this fucking shit anymore.
It's too fucking moronic.

1061
01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:54.416
The fact that the LA Times will
hire such a fucking halfwit is beyond me.

1062
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.791
First she says that I brilliantly
subvert the white savior trope.

1063
01:00:57.875 --> 01:00:59.000
She is a savior.

1064
01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:00.791
She's trying to save her.

1065
01:01:00.875 --> 01:01:03.333
so how the fuck
did I subvert it. lady? How?

1066
01:01:03.416 --> 01:01:05.416
You wanna know how?
It's because I'm Black!

1067
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.041
If I was white.
she would've said I fell for the trope.

1068
01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:10.708
But because I'm a man.
she can question my intention

1069
01:01:10.791 --> 01:01:13.250
saying that I'm reveling
in the trauma of a woman.

1070
01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:14.625
"Better implied than depicted."

1071
01:01:14.708 --> 01:01:17.791
The fuck out of here! Why?
Because Taylor took her shirt off?

1072
01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:21.083
I'm sure she just doesn't think
that the nudity was necessary.

1073
01:01:21.166 --> 01:01:22.625
None of it is necessary. Marie.

1074
01:01:22.708 --> 01:01:24.416
None of this shit is necessary.

1075
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:28.833
Movement. blocking. lighting.
fucking digital versus film.

1076
01:01:28.916 --> 01:01:31.625
This cut here. that cut here.
Let's pan. Two-shot.

1077
01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:33.916
None of this shit matters.
It's all about what you want.

1078
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.833
But my fucking problem with her
before she even wrote this dumb-ass.

1079
01:01:36.916 --> 01:01:40.000
bitch-ass. pussy-ass review is
the same after readin' this cock-sucking.

1080
01:01:40.083 --> 01:01:42.041
-motherfucking. dog-dick review.
-[giggles]

1081
01:01:42.125 --> 01:01:45.083
She's not looking at the film.
The ideas in it.

1082
01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:46.875
the emotions. or the craft.

1083
01:01:46.958 --> 01:01:49.375
Cinema doesn't need
to have a fucking message.

1084
01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:51.833
It needs to have a heart and electricity.

1085
01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:54.791
Morons like this
sap the world of its mystery

1086
01:01:54.875 --> 01:01:58.000
because they need everything
spelled out with fucking A-B-C blocks.

1087
01:01:58.083 --> 01:02:01.500
And they're terrified to embrace
anything potentially dangerous

1088
01:02:01.583 --> 01:02:03.750
because they're trying
to predict the culture.

1089
01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:07.750
This fucking bobblehead shouldn't be
writing for the LA fucking Times.

1090
01:02:07.833 --> 01:02:11.000
She should be holding
smiling sun placards for the local news

1091
01:02:11.083 --> 01:02:13.958
because all she is.
is a motherfucking weatherman!

1092
01:02:16.125 --> 01:02:17.583
Or weatherwoman.

1093
01:02:18.916 --> 01:02:20.041
Whatever.

1094
01:02:21.333 --> 01:02:24.250
Fucking… Dorothy-ass…

1095
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.166
Malcolm.

1096
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
What?

1097
01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:34.791
She did call it a genuine masterwork.

1098
01:02:37.666 --> 01:02:38.958
I don't give a fuck!

1099
01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.625
Unlike her. at least I'm consistent.

1100
01:02:42.166 --> 01:02:43.916
You can't hang everything on identity.

1101
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.333
You can't say that I brilliantly
subverted this trope 'cause I'm Black.

1102
01:02:47.416 --> 01:02:50.000
but I fell into this one
because I'm a fucking man!

1103
01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:51.750
Identities are constantly shifting.

1104
01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:54.958
Does the male gaze exist
if the filmmaker's gay and not straight?

1105
01:02:55.041 --> 01:02:57.208
And to what degree?
What if they're asexual?

1106
01:02:57.291 --> 01:02:59.666
What if they're transitioning
and you don't even know it?

1107
01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:03.125
You can only look back at things
and wonder what the fuck it all means!

1108
01:03:03.791 --> 01:03:07.750
I mean. why did Ben Hecht and Selznick.
two fucking Jewish men.

1109
01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:10.916
spend so much time on Gone With the Wind?

1110
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.125
To this day.

1111
01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:16.083
no one can explain to me why the fuck
Billy Wilder made Spirit of St. Louis

1112
01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:19.208
and lionized
that Nazi bastard Lindbergh. huh?

1113
01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:22.708
Or why Ida Lupino loved film noir
and fucking violent men.

1114
01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:24.833
Why Ed Wood wore fucking panties?

1115
01:03:24.916 --> 01:03:29.208
He wore panties and made B films
about fucking space aliens.

1116
01:03:29.291 --> 01:03:32.458
Or Elaine May was fascinated
with emotionally stunted men.

1117
01:03:32.541 --> 01:03:34.541
I mean. did she see herself in them?

1118
01:03:35.208 --> 01:03:38.625
Did she hate them in real life. but wanted
to get to know them through the work?

1119
01:03:38.708 --> 01:03:42.875
The fact that Barry Jenkins isn't gay.
is that what made Moonlight so universal?

1120
01:03:42.958 --> 01:03:46.041
Or was being gay the reason Cukor
empathized with women more than men?

1121
01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:47.750
It's all a mystery is the point!

1122
01:03:47.833 --> 01:03:50.625
What drives a filmmaker?
What drives an artist?

1123
01:03:50.708 --> 01:03:52.458
[breathing heavily]

1124
01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:56.625
I mean. why did Pontecorvo.
a fucking rich Italian Jewish man…

1125
01:03:56.708 --> 01:04:00.708
Why did he fucking feel such a kinship
to Algerian Muslim guerrilla fighters

1126
01:04:00.791 --> 01:04:02.916
that he fucking made Battle of Algiers?

1127
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.416
A fucking classic! Tell me that!

1128
01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.625
Can you tell me that? Fucking Karen!

1129
01:04:07.708 --> 01:04:11.666
Can you tell me that? You can't. can you?
Because why? 'Cause nobody knows!

1130
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:15.750
Who the fuck knows? Who the fuck knows?
Why did I shoot the scene the way I did?

1131
01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:17.791
Is it because I'm a man.
because I'm straight?

1132
01:04:17.875 --> 01:04:19.708
Is it because I'm desensitized to violence

1133
01:04:19.791 --> 01:04:23.000
or is it because I believe that
if you witness trauma onscreen.

1134
01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:25.750
the audience should also
feel that fucking trauma?

1135
01:04:25.833 --> 01:04:27.833
That is the mystery of art. Of film.

1136
01:04:27.916 --> 01:04:31.125
What drives someone to make something
and fucking say something.

1137
01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:34.750
Now. you can criticize this system.
which. like every fucking system.

1138
01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:36.041
is white as fuck.

1139
01:04:36.125 --> 01:04:38.750
and in our business.
fucking male and white as fuck!

1140
01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:40.500
I mean. goddamn!

1141
01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:42.583
I've been waiting my whole life.
I've been askin'.

1142
01:04:42.666 --> 01:04:44.375
"Where the fuck
are all the Black filmmakers.

1143
01:04:44.458 --> 01:04:46.916
'cause I'm gettin' sick and tired
of these little British boys

1144
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.750
runnin' around here all in they feelings
trying to overcome a fucking birth defect

1145
01:04:50.833 --> 01:04:52.875
to save the fucking Queen from Hitler."

1146
01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:55.416
-[chuckling]
-Just do me a fucking favor. all right?

1147
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:58.666
Ban every fucking film
with a postscript. and we'll be good.

1148
01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:02.125
We'll be fucking great!

1149
01:05:02.208 --> 01:05:06.625
But to write shit like this?
To write this bullshit?

1150
01:05:06.708 --> 01:05:09.708
To box people in
because you don't have the love of film.

1151
01:05:09.791 --> 01:05:12.916
because you don't have the mind
to critique the form. medium. technique.

1152
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.291
You don't have the words
to describe the emotions

1153
01:05:15.375 --> 01:05:17.708
or too much fear
that you're not gonna get clicks.

1154
01:05:17.791 --> 01:05:20.291
or too much fear
that the mob's gonna turn on you.

1155
01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:23.416
Fuck you for inhibiting
the ability for artists to dream about

1156
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.666
what life may be like
for other fucking people.

1157
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:28.541
Fuck you! Twice! With a sick cactus dick!

1158
01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:31.791
Even if you come up short.
even if you could do better. fuck you!

1159
01:05:31.875 --> 01:05:33.666
You're the reason they make this stale.

1160
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:35.833
safe. stagnant turgid shit
in the first place!

1161
01:05:35.916 --> 01:05:38.375
You're the reason! Not me!
You're the reason!

1162
01:05:39.875 --> 01:05:43.666
I mean. you should be fucking bold!
You should be fucking reckless!

1163
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:45.958
People should be fucking reckless!

1164
01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:48.208
They should be yelling
at the top of their lungs!

1165
01:05:48.291 --> 01:05:52.375
Hey. Karen! Hey. Al!

1166
01:05:52.458 --> 01:05:55.666
I hear you. and I don't give a fuck!

1167
01:05:56.291 --> 01:05:58.166
Because they're not gonna get any better

1168
01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:02.083
until they start rebelling against this
purist. moralistic. academic nonsense

1169
01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:04.916
in the same way Spike Lee
rebelled against the white system

1170
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.541
when he made Do the Right Thing.

1171
01:06:06.625 --> 01:06:08.833
Normally. I wish death
upon someone like this.

1172
01:06:08.916 --> 01:06:11.541
Someone who lacks
the fucking imagination like this.

1173
01:06:11.625 --> 01:06:14.416
But instead. I'm gonna pray fucking hard.

1174
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.625
the way my mama taught me.
that she gets fucking carpal tunnel.

1175
01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.541
until her hands atrophy and cramp

1176
01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:24.833
and she can no longer write nonsensical
fucking garbage like this anymore!

1177
01:06:24.916 --> 01:06:26.333
[panting]

1178
01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:27.833
-[grunts]
-[Marie] Mmm.

1179
01:06:27.916 --> 01:06:29.291
[laughing]

1180
01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:33.083
Oh. my God.

1181
01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:39.666
So this is what happens
when you get a good review?

1182
01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:45.708
-You're fucking crazy.
-[both chuckle]

1183
01:06:45.791 --> 01:06:47.666
I'm ser-- You're delirious.

1184
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:49.250
-[Malcolm grunts]
-[chuckles]

1185
01:06:50.291 --> 01:06:53.125
Honestly. Malcolm.
you are a true insane person.

1186
01:06:54.333 --> 01:06:56.916
I know. I know. I just…
I'm tired of fighting. Marie.

1187
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.625
That was a fight
you had entirely with yourself.

1188
01:06:59.708 --> 01:07:01.458
[both chuckling]

1189
01:07:02.833 --> 01:07:04.500
You think you're the first writer

1190
01:07:04.583 --> 01:07:07.666
in the history of writing
to have this issue with critics?

1191
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:08.666
'Course not.

1192
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:11.458
Of course not.
'cause it's all the same bullshit.

1193
01:07:11.541 --> 01:07:14.291
So. what. Malcolm? You wanna make movies.

1194
01:07:14.375 --> 01:07:17.333
and no one's allowed to say
anything bad about them?

1195
01:07:17.416 --> 01:07:20.083
Give me a break.

1196
01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:22.583
[mockingly] "Oh. no!
Someone attacked my movie."

1197
01:07:22.666 --> 01:07:24.750
Well. fuck these lazy-ass critics.

1198
01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:30.000
Malcolm. you are not making pottery
for a living. okay?

1199
01:07:30.083 --> 01:07:34.708
You are a filmmaker.
and filmmaking is the most capitalistic.

1200
01:07:34.791 --> 01:07:37.708
mainstream fucking art form
on the planet Earth.

1201
01:07:37.791 --> 01:07:40.083
No matter how many times
Taylor told E! News

1202
01:07:40.166 --> 01:07:41.916
that she was a fucking communist.

1203
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
-She what?
-Or a Maoist.

1204
01:07:44.083 --> 01:07:45.708
-Come on.
-It was something like that.

1205
01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:48.208
She might've talked about
the redistribution of wealth.

1206
01:07:48.291 --> 01:07:49.333
lack of social programs.

1207
01:07:49.416 --> 01:07:51.916
-While selling a film?
-The mental healthcare industry--

1208
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.583
-For $15 a ticket?
-I'm just saying--

1209
01:07:53.666 --> 01:07:54.791
On E! News.

1210
01:07:55.458 --> 01:07:56.875
It was Entertainment Tonight.

1211
01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:00.416
And you wonder
why the white girl's talking about

1212
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.458
the mental healthcare system
in her review.

1213
01:08:03.958 --> 01:08:04.875
Because…

1214
01:08:04.958 --> 01:08:06.541
-[Marie] Mm-hmm.
-[mumbling]

1215
01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:09.416
Oh. she… Oh. shit. you're right.

1216
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.333
Right?

1217
01:08:10.875 --> 01:08:12.625
Oh. [chuckles]

1218
01:08:12.708 --> 01:08:14.458
-Yep. [chuckles]
-[stomping feet]

1219
01:08:14.541 --> 01:08:16.625
I hate to break it to you. but uh…

1220
01:08:17.583 --> 01:08:19.708
no one in this game is a radical.

1221
01:08:19.791 --> 01:08:23.333
-Oh. Taylor's pretty radical.
-Bullshit. She likes to play one on TV.

1222
01:08:23.416 --> 01:08:24.416
What do you mean?

1223
01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:27.541
All of y'all are
a bunch of hookers and hoes.

1224
01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:30.083
-You calling me a ho?
-Yes. I am calling you a ho.

1225
01:08:30.166 --> 01:08:31.916
-[chuckles]
-[laughing] Fuck you.

1226
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.583
'Cause you're a ho!
What? You are. That's fine.

1227
01:08:35.375 --> 01:08:37.416
That's why you're hell-bent
on sounding smart.

1228
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.000
'cause you're compensating
for the fact that you're a ho.

1229
01:08:40.083 --> 01:08:42.625
Instead of just understanding that…

1230
01:08:42.708 --> 01:08:45.583
this is just how
the world of ho-dom turns.

1231
01:08:45.666 --> 01:08:49.250
You know. you got an actress
in a $2.000 dress.

1232
01:08:49.333 --> 01:08:51.083
talkin' about socialism on a red carpet

1233
01:08:51.166 --> 01:08:53.625
because she's too afraid
to admit that. guess what.

1234
01:08:53.708 --> 01:08:55.708
she's just… she's just a fuckin' actor.

1235
01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:57.750
There's no shame in that.

1236
01:08:58.333 --> 01:09:00.875
And then you got
every entertainment outlet

1237
01:09:00.958 --> 01:09:04.625
running with her call to arms.
her viva la revolution.

1238
01:09:04.708 --> 01:09:07.708
Not because they actually care
or want to spread the message.

1239
01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:12.250
But because they know that there's
nothing that sells more than disgust.

1240
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
-Hmm.
-That's what gets the clicks.

1241
01:09:16.083 --> 01:09:19.041
And you dumbasses
fall for that shit every time.

1242
01:09:20.208 --> 01:09:22.666
Honestly. nobody cares
what you have to say.

1243
01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:24.625
They don't.

1244
01:09:25.208 --> 01:09:27.166
You guys play fucking dress-up
for a living.

1245
01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:28.125
[Malcolm scoffs]

1246
01:09:28.708 --> 01:09:33.916
This is some only-in-America. ho-ass shit.

1247
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.333
[laughing]

1248
01:09:35.416 --> 01:09:37.875
And all of you are guilty.

1249
01:09:38.833 --> 01:09:42.791
You know? So just stay in your lane.
Keep doing your ho shit. It's fine.

1250
01:09:43.958 --> 01:09:45.125
[Malcolm mumbles]

1251
01:09:45.208 --> 01:09:48.416
Malcolm. you got
a great review with an asterisk.

1252
01:09:50.416 --> 01:09:53.041
Boo-fucking-hoo.

1253
01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:58.708
I'm a ho. huh?

1254
01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:01.125
Mm-hmm. Most definitely.

1255
01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:06.333
-I love you.
-Don't manipulate me.

1256
01:10:06.416 --> 01:10:07.500
[kissing]

1257
01:10:07.583 --> 01:10:09.583
[slow jazz music playing]

1258
01:10:47.958 --> 01:10:49.250
-Okay.
-Okay.

1259
01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.583
-Okay. I got a gameplan.
-Okay.

1260
01:10:52.333 --> 01:10:54.333
-I love what's happening.
-[chuckles]

1261
01:10:55.208 --> 01:10:57.250
Oh. my God. And thank God. I just…

1262
01:10:57.333 --> 01:10:59.333
-Been wanting to do this all night.
-[giggles]

1263
01:10:59.416 --> 01:11:00.416
Here's the gameplan.

1264
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.250
I'm gonna go from here…

1265
01:11:03.375 --> 01:11:04.458
to the bathroom.

1266
01:11:05.291 --> 01:11:06.833
-Because I have to pee.
-Okay.

1267
01:11:06.916 --> 01:11:08.333
-Okay. Is it okay?
-That's fine.

1268
01:11:08.416 --> 01:11:12.083
And let's just keep it positive.
Happy thoughts.

1269
01:11:12.791 --> 01:11:14.958
You stay right here.
Don't move. You look beautiful.

1270
01:11:15.041 --> 01:11:16.791
-Stay right here. Okay?
-Okay.

1271
01:11:16.875 --> 01:11:19.083
-You stay right here.
-Okay.

1272
01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:22.833
Hey.

1273
01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:26.375
-Oh. my God. Oh. my…
-[chuckles]

1274
01:11:26.458 --> 01:11:28.458
[footsteps receding]

1275
01:11:51.791 --> 01:11:53.500
[urinating]

1276
01:11:55.541 --> 01:11:56.500
[toilet flushes]

1277
01:11:58.583 --> 01:12:00.416
-[faucet squeaks]
-[water running]

1278
01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:18.833
[Marie] Malcolm?

1279
01:12:23.458 --> 01:12:24.291
Yeah?

1280
01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:30.291
Can I ask you a question
and you promise to answer

1281
01:12:30.375 --> 01:12:32.125
without making me feel like shit?

1282
01:12:33.958 --> 01:12:35.500
[sighs deeply]

1283
01:12:35.583 --> 01:12:36.500
Yeah.

1284
01:12:45.208 --> 01:12:46.708
Why didn't you cast me?

1285
01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.791
When you first wrote it.
you wrote it for me.

1286
01:13:02.916 --> 01:13:04.666
So why didn't you cast me?

1287
01:13:05.583 --> 01:13:06.708
[clicks tongue]

1288
01:13:11.666 --> 01:13:14.208
So that's what this whole thing
has been about tonight?

1289
01:13:15.916 --> 01:13:16.791
[softly] No.

1290
01:13:16.875 --> 01:13:18.500
-Bullshit. Marie.
-It's not.

1291
01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:21.458
-You're lying. Yes. it is.
-[voice shaking] I'm not lying.

1292
01:13:24.041 --> 01:13:27.875
At some point. Malcolm. this was
something that we were gonna do together.

1293
01:13:30.041 --> 01:13:32.083
And I don't know when that changed.

1294
01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:37.375
I don't know when. I don't know how.
I just know that I was in that audience…

1295
01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:40.625
and I thought to myself. "Wow."

1296
01:13:44.083 --> 01:13:46.583
"I did not mean to give all that away."

1297
01:13:46.666 --> 01:13:48.125
[breath trembling]

1298
01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:53.250
And I don't wanna get
into all the reasons why you cast Taylor.

1299
01:13:54.833 --> 01:13:56.833
but you're so good at fighting.

1300
01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:00.041
You're so good at fighting.
You fought to make the movie.

1301
01:14:00.125 --> 01:14:03.750
to make it the way you wanted to make it.
So why didn't you fight for me?

1302
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:11.208
Because I would have been good. [sniffles]

1303
01:14:12.916 --> 01:14:14.166
I would have.

1304
01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:17.500
Maybe even better.

1305
01:14:20.166 --> 01:14:21.166
So there it is.

1306
01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:25.083
-What?
-The fucking truth.

1307
01:14:25.166 --> 01:14:28.583
Leave it to you to spend the entire night
burning it all to the ground

1308
01:14:28.666 --> 01:14:32.708
only to reveal that in the end.
you're just jealous.

1309
01:14:32.791 --> 01:14:34.291
-I'm not jealous.
-Yes. you are.

1310
01:14:34.375 --> 01:14:36.208
-I'm not jealous.
-Of course you are.

1311
01:14:36.291 --> 01:14:39.250
The feeling that I'm feeling right now
is deeper than that.

1312
01:14:40.541 --> 01:14:42.333
It's not jealousy. [crying]

1313
01:14:42.416 --> 01:14:44.250
Oh. come on. Give me a break. Marie.

1314
01:14:44.333 --> 01:14:46.750
It's the fact that
I can't tell my story anymore.

1315
01:14:47.833 --> 01:14:52.958
I can't articulate all the fucking chaos
that's going on in here

1316
01:14:53.041 --> 01:14:54.250
because you already did.

1317
01:14:54.333 --> 01:14:55.458
[sniffles]

1318
01:14:55.541 --> 01:14:57.583
You already did and Taylor already did.

1319
01:14:58.833 --> 01:15:00.875
I know it's not solely mine.

1320
01:15:01.583 --> 01:15:02.708
I know that.

1321
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.875
I know it happened to both of us.

1322
01:15:05.958 --> 01:15:09.083
But the difference is you were able
to take all the ugly shit

1323
01:15:09.166 --> 01:15:10.791
and make it something beautiful.

1324
01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.833
Something good.

1325
01:15:15.708 --> 01:15:16.916
Something that…

1326
01:15:18.541 --> 01:15:20.250
that could move people.

1327
01:15:21.916 --> 01:15:23.875
But. Malcolm. I'm stuck with it.

1328
01:15:33.083 --> 01:15:34.125
Yeah.

1329
01:15:34.208 --> 01:15:37.041
I just wish it was something
we could have done together.

1330
01:15:37.541 --> 01:15:39.916
And to be brutally honest. yes…

1331
01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:42.833
I would have been better.

1332
01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:46.166
Because I experienced it.

1333
01:15:47.541 --> 01:15:48.625
I lived it.

1334
01:15:52.541 --> 01:15:56.000
Not only would I have been better.
I would have made your film better.

1335
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:59.541
You gave up acting.

1336
01:15:59.625 --> 01:16:02.291
When I got the film financed.
I asked you to audition.

1337
01:16:02.375 --> 01:16:06.416
You said yes. but you were reluctant.
You have talent. but that's not enough.

1338
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:09.416
It's not enough.
You have to want it. Marie.

1339
01:16:10.125 --> 01:16:13.333
-Trust me. Malcolm. I wanted this one.
-That's fuckin' bullshit.

1340
01:16:13.416 --> 01:16:16.375
You didn't try. and that's
the harsh reality of all of this.

1341
01:16:16.458 --> 01:16:18.833
That same instinct
that exists in Imani. in you.

1342
01:16:18.916 --> 01:16:22.291
that instinct to fucking self-sabotage.

1343
01:16:22.375 --> 01:16:23.500
that didn't go away.

1344
01:16:24.041 --> 01:16:27.916
-I didn't try because you didn't want me.
-Now you wanna play the victim.

1345
01:16:30.458 --> 01:16:33.916
Now you wanna say you felt like
I didn't want you so you didn't try.

1346
01:16:41.333 --> 01:16:43.041
You are fucking intolerable.

1347
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.500
[sighs deeply]

1348
01:17:08.083 --> 01:17:12.000
[Marie] Fucking… You fake-ass.
fraudulent. thievin' fuckin' con man!

1349
01:17:12.083 --> 01:17:15.708
You didn't want me because if you did.
you would have to share the stage.

1350
01:17:15.791 --> 01:17:18.250
You wouldn't be
the sole author of this film.

1351
01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:21.833
It would have a lineage that extended
beyond you and your brilliance.

1352
01:17:21.916 --> 01:17:26.166
because people would ask me and I'd say.
"Yes. this shit happened to me."

1353
01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:29.875
Then all of a sudden everyone would go.
"Is it him or her that's talented?"

1354
01:17:29.958 --> 01:17:33.041
If that's what you have
to tell yourself. then be my guest.

1355
01:17:33.125 --> 01:17:34.375
It's about ownership.

1356
01:17:34.458 --> 01:17:36.291
It's about the illusion you wanna create

1357
01:17:36.375 --> 01:17:38.333
that filmmaking
isn't a collaborative effort.

1358
01:17:38.416 --> 01:17:41.000
It's you. and everybody else
is just following directions.

1359
01:17:41.083 --> 01:17:43.166
-Because if it were me…
-[grunts loudly]

1360
01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:46.541
If it were authentic 'cause of me.
you couldn't swing your dick around!

1361
01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:48.375
That's why you didn't thank me tonight.

1362
01:17:48.458 --> 01:17:51.000
-That's also why you didn't cast me.
-Authenticity.

1363
01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:53.166
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Ain't that the word of the day?

1364
01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:56.208
It's all I heard tonight.
"He's such an authentic filmmaker."

1365
01:17:56.291 --> 01:17:59.125
"The movie is authentic."
"He channeled his voice authentically."

1366
01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:00.833
-Know why people love that word?
-Why?

1367
01:18:00.916 --> 01:18:02.625
They don't know what makes something good.

1368
01:18:02.708 --> 01:18:03.916
I think authenticity is key.

1369
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.208
Of course.
because that's all you have to offer.

1370
01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:08.833
-Anyone. all they have to say.
-It's all I have to offer.

1371
01:18:08.916 --> 01:18:11.416
The only word that people
that don't know shit about film

1372
01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.208
feels like they got something to offer…

1373
01:18:13.291 --> 01:18:14.833
No. I have nothing to offer.

1374
01:18:14.916 --> 01:18:18.458
They can't say anything about film.
but they love to talk about authenticity.

1375
01:18:18.541 --> 01:18:19.875
They don't know dick about film.

1376
01:18:19.958 --> 01:18:22.541
About fucking Citizen Kane
or Best Years of Our Lives--

1377
01:18:22.625 --> 01:18:24.625
No one fucking cares about that shit!

1378
01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:28.041
Authenticity. Oh. shit!
They know that shit through and through.

1379
01:18:28.125 --> 01:18:30.875
Authenticity does not matter.
your perspective doesn't--

1380
01:18:30.958 --> 01:18:32.416
You don't fucking have any!

1381
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.833
Recreating reality
doesn't make something interesting.

1382
01:18:34.916 --> 01:18:37.458
It's about your interpretation
about reality.

1383
01:18:37.541 --> 01:18:39.833
-What you feel about reality.
-You're full of shit.

1384
01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:41.250
What you reveal about reality.

1385
01:18:41.333 --> 01:18:43.166
Perspective. your perspective.

1386
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:46.541
Transcribing a conversation or holding
a camera up and pressing record.

1387
01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:48.541
that's a fucking YouTube video.

1388
01:18:48.625 --> 01:18:50.333
-That's a confession or memoir.
-Okay.

1389
01:18:50.416 --> 01:18:52.500
-We've seen and heard it a thousand times.
-All right.

1390
01:18:52.583 --> 01:18:56.125
Your experience. your life.
your fucking struggle. doesn't matter.

1391
01:18:56.208 --> 01:18:59.791
You've been an addict. boring!
You overdosing. not fucking interesting.

1392
01:18:59.875 --> 01:19:01.875
It's about transferring your emotions

1393
01:19:01.958 --> 01:19:04.583
and all those moments
into something cinematic and moving.

1394
01:19:04.666 --> 01:19:06.416
So. you know what? Good luck. Marie.

1395
01:19:07.958 --> 01:19:09.458
-I hate you!
-I hate you hate too!

1396
01:19:09.541 --> 01:19:11.416
-I hate you more!
-I hate you the most!

1397
01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.083
I fucking hate you!

I've ever met in my entire life.

to cut your head off one moment

sayin' to me
that you could do it better than Taylor

1463
01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:49.833
and seed doubt in my mind that.
for the rest of my life.

-Mm-mm.

You know what's interesting
about the white girl from LA Times

1471
01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:16.916
calling out that scene in her review?

1472
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.708
Marie. who cares?

1473
01:24:18.791 --> 01:24:22.500
I mean. I've always said.
it was my least favorite in the film.

1474
01:24:23.416 --> 01:24:24.958
But my favorite in the script.

1475
01:24:25.666 --> 01:24:27.916
Can we talk about this later. please?

1476
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.666
-I think it's important. you know?
-I beg you.

1477
01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:33.500
To look back and wonder why that is.

1478
01:24:36.125 --> 01:24:37.958
-Don't you?
-No.

1479
01:24:38.041 --> 01:24:42.333
Not to strip you of your mystery.
you know. just out of curiosity.

1480
01:24:43.291 --> 01:24:46.708
Out of pursuit of wanting to be.
I don't know. a better fucking artist.

1481
01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:50.000
Oh. You are exhausting.

1482
01:24:51.083 --> 01:24:54.000
You gonna be this exhausting at 70
or will you have exhausted yourself?

1483
01:24:54.083 --> 01:24:55.541
That depends where you are.

1484
01:24:55.625 --> 01:24:57.833
Living with the white girl
from the LA Times

1485
01:24:57.916 --> 01:25:00.583
because at least I can
win an argument against her.

1486
01:25:00.666 --> 01:25:05.166
But. you know. It just made me wonder.
why did I see that scene so differently?

1487
01:25:05.250 --> 01:25:08.166
I don't know. How did you see the scene?

1488
01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:09.458
It was less graphic.

1489
01:25:09.541 --> 01:25:12.416
So what? He doesn't attack Imani?
That's what it was on the page.

1490
01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:16.375
No. he attacks her. I just never thought
that you'd shoot it with her top off.

1491
01:25:16.916 --> 01:25:18.750
-What's the difference?
-Her tits were out.

1492
01:25:18.833 --> 01:25:21.208
-So?
-So. I just feel like you sexualized her.

1493
01:25:21.291 --> 01:25:23.916
If I rolled a camera on you
right now. am I sexualizing you.

1494
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.166
or is this what you have on.
on a Friday night?

1495
01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:27.291
My tits aren't out.

1496
01:25:27.375 --> 01:25:30.083
If you were in a Chuck E. Cheese.
they'd throw your ass out.

1497
01:25:30.166 --> 01:25:32.583
-It was Taylor's idea anyway.
-I'm sure it was.

1498
01:25:33.083 --> 01:25:36.166
Look. it just made
everything more graphic.

1499
01:25:36.666 --> 01:25:38.875
Okay? And I just thought…

1500
01:25:40.083 --> 01:25:42.875
would the scene have been
a bit different if you were a woman?

1501
01:25:43.833 --> 01:25:46.916
Yes. but I also would have shot
the entire movie differently

1502
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.458
because I wouldn't have been me.
I would've been a woman.

1503
01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:51.500
I would've had
a totally different sensibility.

1504
01:25:51.583 --> 01:25:53.583
But that's not how
you judge film intelligently.

1505
01:25:53.666 --> 01:25:57.916
by the 600 trillion different choices
not made due to an intangible

1506
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.416
yet purely hypothetical
assessment of one's identity.

1507
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.791
But rather the choices
actually being fucking made.

1508
01:26:02.875 --> 01:26:05.583
[sighs] Look. I'm not defending her
as a great fuckin' thinker.

1509
01:26:05.666 --> 01:26:07.333
Good. 'Cause she's an idiot.

1510
01:26:07.416 --> 01:26:10.291
I'm just saying… would the movie
have been a little better

1511
01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:12.000
if you had a dash of femininity?

1512
01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:13.666
-Who gives a fuck?
-I do.

1513
01:26:13.791 --> 01:26:15.750
-Fuck.
-I do. I do.

1514
01:26:15.833 --> 01:26:18.208
I do. Malcolm.
because it just made me wonder

1515
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:20.166
if the problem
she has with you as a filmmaker

1516
01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:22.416
is the same problem
I have with you as a partner.

1517
01:26:23.166 --> 01:26:24.000
Well…

1518
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.583
All that being said and done.
Karen thinks I'm a fucking tour-de-force.

1519
01:26:30.666 --> 01:26:32.833
-[urinating]
-[scoffs] Now you like her review?

1520
01:26:32.916 --> 01:26:36.125
[scoffs] Fucking masterwork is
what you're looking at right now. girl.

1521
01:26:36.208 --> 01:26:38.583
[groans and chuckles]
You're joking. but I'm not.

1522
01:26:38.666 --> 01:26:42.291
That's unfortunate. because I really
can't keep arguing about this shit.

1523
01:26:42.375 --> 01:26:45.041
The more I think about it.
her problem is my problem.

1524
01:26:45.125 --> 01:26:48.666
-Which is what?
-That I'm with you. I haven't walked out.

1525
01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:50.875
I'm not wondering
what other movies are playing.

1526
01:26:50.958 --> 01:26:53.250
I got you. I'm on your side.
and then you just…

1527
01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:55.375
You gotta fucking take shit too far.

1528
01:26:55.458 --> 01:26:56.583
[Malcolm] Come on.

1529
01:26:56.666 --> 01:26:59.833
No. we're in a fight.
maybe the worst fight we've ever been in.

1530
01:26:59.916 --> 01:27:03.291
but instead of just making your point
and saying it's not about you.

1531
01:27:03.375 --> 01:27:04.958
it's an amalgamation of people.

1532
01:27:05.041 --> 01:27:08.125
you gotta fucking revel in it.
You gotta twist the knife

1533
01:27:08.208 --> 01:27:13.291
and put images in my head that you and I
both know will never fucking leave me.

1534
01:27:13.375 --> 01:27:14.333
[Malcolm] What?

1535
01:27:15.291 --> 01:27:16.666
-Kiki.
-Oh!

1536
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:17.583
Kiki.

1537
01:27:17.666 --> 01:27:20.000
-I was angry. What the fuck!
-From outside of St. Louis.

1538
01:27:20.083 --> 01:27:23.291
-A heart-shaped bathtub?
-I was angry.

1539
01:27:23.375 --> 01:27:25.583
You're a cheeseball. Ugh! Malcolm!

1540
01:27:25.666 --> 01:27:27.625
-Ew! Ew!
-[laughing]

1541
01:27:27.708 --> 01:27:28.875
Ugh!

1542
01:27:29.375 --> 01:27:33.291
You're a fucking moron. honestly.
You could've won without all that shit.

1543
01:27:33.375 --> 01:27:35.791
You could've won
with 20% of what you said.

1544
01:27:35.875 --> 01:27:38.708
but you cannot help yourself.
It is just who you are.

1545
01:27:38.791 --> 01:27:42.500
'Cause if I were ever fucked
in a penthouse suite of a Marriott.

1546
01:27:42.583 --> 01:27:45.000
in or around a heart-shaped bathtub.

1547
01:27:45.083 --> 01:27:49.250
I would never fucking
utter a word about it aloud.

1548
01:27:49.333 --> 01:27:51.708
I would never tell my friends about it.

1549
01:27:51.791 --> 01:27:53.875
I would never wield it
in a fight as a weapon.

1550
01:27:53.958 --> 01:27:55.791
You know why?
Because I know it would hurt me

1551
01:27:55.875 --> 01:27:57.541
way more than it would hurt you.

1552
01:27:58.916 --> 01:28:01.791
[sighing] And it's a bummer.
Malcolm. you know?

1553
01:28:02.333 --> 01:28:05.708
I really enjoyed having sex with you.
Up until about 15 minutes ago.

1554
01:28:05.791 --> 01:28:09.666
it was an aspect of our relationship
that I genuinely had no complaints about.

1555
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:14.500
It was also my only remaining vice.
that and cigarettes.

1556
01:28:15.875 --> 01:28:19.500
But. well. lo and behold.
you had to take shit too far…

1557
01:28:19.583 --> 01:28:20.500
[Malcolm] Come on.

1558
01:28:20.583 --> 01:28:24.916
And obliterate any and all joy
there was to be found in fucking you.

1559
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.875
The gloves were off. okay?
We were in a fight. like…

1560
01:28:27.958 --> 01:28:32.750
Oh. it didn't support your argument.
It just grossed me the fuck out.

1561
01:28:32.833 --> 01:28:36.916
It made me go.
"I cannot believe I have unprotected sex

1562
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.875
with this nasty-ass.
grimy-dicked fuckin' brute.

1563
01:28:40.958 --> 01:28:44.750
a fuckin' animal.
a fuckin' barnyard animal."

1564
01:28:44.833 --> 01:28:47.125
-[chuckles]
-That's what you are. A fuckin' hog.

1565
01:28:47.208 --> 01:28:50.750
You are a shit-where-you-eat hog.
Hog of a human being.

1566
01:28:50.833 --> 01:28:53.750
-[gags]
-[Malcolm laughing]

1567
01:28:53.833 --> 01:28:55.541
Yeah. you fuckin' think it's funny.

1568
01:28:55.625 --> 01:28:57.833
-You're being dramatic.
-I'm not being dramatic.

1569
01:28:57.916 --> 01:29:00.875
You think 'cause we had a common enemy
in Karen from the LA Times.

1570
01:29:00.958 --> 01:29:02.916
all shit is sweet. We good now?

1571
01:29:03.625 --> 01:29:05.791
Think again. motherfucker. We ain't good.

1572
01:29:05.875 --> 01:29:07.041
-[chuckles]
-[Malcolm laughing]

1573
01:29:07.125 --> 01:29:09.708
She's my spiritual sister. I mean that.

1574
01:29:09.791 --> 01:29:11.375
We're both seeking refuge

1575
01:29:11.458 --> 01:29:14.541
from your assaultive.
battering ram of a fucking personality.

1576
01:29:14.625 --> 01:29:18.250
Because of your limitations
as a partner. and a filmmaker.

1577
01:29:18.333 --> 01:29:20.333
we are both ducking for cover.

1578
01:29:20.833 --> 01:29:24.750
We may not have a lot in common.
but sis and I are in the fucking foxhole.

1579
01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:27.083
Oh. you are
the last person to talk. Marie.

1580
01:29:27.166 --> 01:29:29.875
You have fucked.
dated some of the wildest.

1581
01:29:29.958 --> 01:29:32.833
strangest human beings
that ever walked this planet Earth.

1582
01:29:32.916 --> 01:29:36.833
You have. one. no fucking standards.
which is a red flag.

1583
01:29:36.916 --> 01:29:39.833
Two. no fucking type.
which is also a red flag.

1584
01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:41.291
And three. no discretion.

1585
01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:43.958
Which means everyone who knows you.
knows you're a red flag

1586
01:29:44.041 --> 01:29:45.916
and talks about you're a red fucking flag.

1587
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.833
Well. Malcolm. here's the difference.

1588
01:29:47.916 --> 01:29:53.458
I'm not lugging my balls around this house
bragging about the places they've been.

1589
01:29:54.333 --> 01:29:55.666
I don't need to know the details.

1590
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:59.958
I don't need to know all the…
the moves and the steps

1591
01:30:00.041 --> 01:30:03.166
and the places that brought you
to my doorstep. You're here.

1592
01:30:04.791 --> 01:30:07.416
I loved you unconditionally. Why?

1593
01:30:08.625 --> 01:30:10.833
Because I value mystery.

1594
01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.875
The unknown. It's what supports
the tension of a relationship

1595
01:30:14.958 --> 01:30:18.291
and forces us to be the best version
of ourselves. The what-if factor.

1596
01:30:18.916 --> 01:30:22.333
What if there's someone
who loved him better?

1597
01:30:23.958 --> 01:30:26.291
Who was smarter. nicer.

1598
01:30:26.375 --> 01:30:29.291
Woke him up every day
with breakfast and a blowjob.

1599
01:30:30.583 --> 01:30:33.041
What if I'm not
the best girlfriend he's ever had?

1600
01:30:33.833 --> 01:30:36.041
What if he dreams of someone else?

1601
01:30:36.125 --> 01:30:39.458
Better conversations.
a girl with hips and an actual ass

1602
01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:42.625
instead of this string bean body?

1603
01:30:42.708 --> 01:30:45.500
Look. I know a little bit about your type.

1604
01:30:45.583 --> 01:30:49.458
Not so much that I'm paralyzed
with insecurity and doubt.

1605
01:30:50.875 --> 01:30:53.208
So that every single day when I get up.

1606
01:30:54.041 --> 01:30:57.041
and I talk to you.
and I wear this fancy fuckin' dress.

1607
01:30:57.125 --> 01:30:58.708
and I hold your hand.

1608
01:30:58.791 --> 01:31:02.708
I'm trying to be the best girlfriend
you have ever had.

1609
01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:07.625
So. when you tell me
that who I'm up against is Kiki…

1610
01:31:07.708 --> 01:31:10.708
-Here we go with the bullshit. Here we go.
-…from St. Louis.

1611
01:31:10.791 --> 01:31:15.041
in a heart-shaped bathtub.
it makes me give a lot less of a fuck.

1612
01:31:15.125 --> 01:31:16.750
You gotta bring up all the shit.

1613
01:31:16.833 --> 01:31:19.666
I don't know where you're going.
but I'm not done.

1614
01:31:21.250 --> 01:31:23.750
I'm not even fucking close to being done.

1615
01:31:25.041 --> 01:31:26.625
[Malcolm sighs]

1616
01:31:26.708 --> 01:31:30.333
But what it also makes me realize.
the reason you don't get jealous

1617
01:31:30.416 --> 01:31:33.041
is because you don't
value that mystery. do you?

1618
01:31:33.625 --> 01:31:35.125
The reason you don't value it.

1619
01:31:35.958 --> 01:31:39.000
the reason why you never wonder
if you're the best fuck I've ever had.

1620
01:31:39.083 --> 01:31:41.666
or the most talented person
I've ever been with.

1621
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:43.791
or the kindest. or the smartest.

1622
01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.458
it's because it is inconceivable to you

1623
01:31:46.541 --> 01:31:50.291
that there is anybody on this planet
that is more interesting than you are.

1624
01:31:51.208 --> 01:31:52.166
[clicks tongue]

1625
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:56.416
Your lack of curiosity is merely
an extension of your narcissism.

1626
01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.791
your megalomania.
your egotistical view of the world.

1627
01:32:00.666 --> 01:32:02.250
As a result of never doubting yourself.

1628
01:32:02.333 --> 01:32:07.208
you never stopped to ask yourself.
"How can I be a better partner?"

1629
01:32:11.666 --> 01:32:15.000
You're good. You are set.

1630
01:32:16.541 --> 01:32:20.041
The man I'm looking at right now
is as good as he's gonna get.

1631
01:32:24.166 --> 01:32:25.708
You yelling at me in a bathtub

1632
01:32:25.791 --> 01:32:28.333
about how you're
gonna snap me like a twig.

1633
01:32:29.208 --> 01:32:32.916
is the best and worst of who
you will be in this relationship.

1634
01:32:37.625 --> 01:32:40.625
And that's why you can forget
to thank me in your speech.

1635
01:32:42.458 --> 01:32:46.458
Because you're not afraid that I'm gonna
come home and go… [inhales deeply]

1636
01:32:46.583 --> 01:32:50.791
"You know what? You lost me tonight.
Fuck this shit. I am out."

1637
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:57.875
But if you steamroll every single person
in your midst. day in and day out.

1638
01:32:57.958 --> 01:33:02.458
you are going to end up living
in a fictional fucking reality.

1639
01:33:05.583 --> 01:33:06.666
Look at me.

1640
01:33:09.833 --> 01:33:11.750
I'm the last person standing.

1641
01:33:13.125 --> 01:33:18.875
I'm the last person to look at you and go.
"You know what? Up your fucking game."

1642
01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.541
"If not for me. then for your work."

1643
01:33:23.791 --> 01:33:27.458
Malcolm. if this is a movie.
you hold on to me for dear fucking life.

1644
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.250
Because that's who
we've been for one another.

1645
01:33:31.958 --> 01:33:36.333
That's who you've been for me
and I've been for you from the day we met.

1646
01:33:38.416 --> 01:33:42.250
From the day I overdosed in that market.
from the day you drove me to rehab.

1647
01:33:42.833 --> 01:33:44.750
From the first day I read your script

1648
01:33:44.833 --> 01:33:48.958
about me. about us.
about our relationship.

1649
01:33:50.666 --> 01:33:53.333
About how drugs
were destroying my ability to love you

1650
01:33:53.416 --> 01:33:55.375
and your ability to love me.

1651
01:34:02.541 --> 01:34:05.791
All I wanted tonight
was a "thank you." Malcolm. That is it.

1652
01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:08.500
That's all.

1653
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.125
"Thank you. Marie.
Thank you for loving me."

1654
